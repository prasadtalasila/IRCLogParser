Nick changes- 

dhruv changed to dhruv1
dhruv1 changed to dhruv2
ramesh changed to ramshe1
ramshe1 changed to ramshe2
ramshe4 changed to dhruv1
dhruv3 changed to ramshe5
ramshe1 changed to dhruv
suka1 changed to sukan2
sukan3 changed to sukan5
sukan5 changed to sukan6
sukan2 changed to dhruv 

Algorithm steps -

If nick1 or nick2 in a sublist then add the one which is not there in that sublist too. If both are not there then put them in a new sublist since they have to be considered as being nicks of some other user.


1. [[dhruv, dhruv1]]

2. [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2]]

3. Since none of ramesh or ramshe1 are in any sublist add them in a new sublist
   [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2], [ramesh, ramshe1]]

4. Because ramshe1 was found in second sublist add ramshe2 there too.
   [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2]]

5. As nick2 i.e. dhruv1 was found in first sublist one add ramshe4 there too.
   [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2]]

6. [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2], [dhruv3, ramshe5]]

7. [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramshe1], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2], [dhruv3, ramshe5]] #ramshe1 added

8. [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramshe1], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2], [dhruv3, ramshe5], [sukan1, sukan2]]

9. [[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramshe1], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2], [dhruv3, ramshe5], [sukan1, sukan2], [sukan3, sukan5]]

10.[[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramshe1], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2], [dhruv3, ramshe5], [sukan1, sukan2], [sukan3, sukan5, sukan6]]

11.[[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramshe1, sukan2], [ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2], [dhruv3, ramshe5], [sukan1, sukan2], [sukan3, sukan5, sukan6]]
   
12.Merge all the elements of the sublists that have one or more common elements. Essentially we are trying to find the connected components in a graph. Networkx can be used to do this.

13.[[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2, dhruv3, ramshe5, sukan1, sukan2], [sukan3, sukan5, sukan6]]

14. If we use LCS method here then we will also get sukan common from sublist2 and sublist1. Then we merge them.

15.[[dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2, dhruv3, ramshe5, sukan1, sukan2, sukan3, sukan5, sukan6]]. We assign a unique userID to this sublist. [[1, dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2, dhruv3, ramshe5, sukan1, sukan2, sukan3, sukan5, sukan6]]

16. However if we consider sublist2 to be the nicks of a different user then we would get - 
    [[1, dhruv, dhruv1, dhruv2, ramshe4, ramesh, ramshe1, ramshe2, dhruv3, ramshe5, sukan1, sukan2], [2, sukan3, sukan5, sukan6]]
