aS'[06:29] <valorie> and this is a hard time of the year, with end of school, etc.\n'
p62
aS'[06:31] <smartboyhw> valorie, not for me. I came back to Kubuntu packaging after my exams (and the results are excellent, so...)\n'
p63
aS'[06:32] <valorie> excellent\n'
p64
aS"[06:32] <valorie> I'm sorry to hear that you'll miss Akademy this year, though\n"

aS'[06:35] <smartboyhw> valorie, we DO have lessons. Meh\n'
p72
aS'[06:35] <valorie> oh, well\n'

aS"[06:36] <valorie> I'm the type of person who visits museums for fun, and reads textbooks\n"
p74
aS'[06:36] <valorie> so learning to me IS fun\n'
p75
aS'[06:37] <smartboyhw> ....\n'
p76

p77
aS"[06:39] <smartboyhw> Yeah, we don't get it until university or latter stages.\n"
p78
aS'[06:39] <smartboyhw> For secondary students, NOT. :P\n'
p79

p89
aS"[06:44] <mgraesslin> valorie: given that I have a talk scheduled, I guess I'm expected to board the plane ;-)\n"
p90
aS'[06:44] <valorie> haha!\n'
p91
aS'[06:44] <valorie> now that I think of it, I did see your name\n'

p94
aS'[06:44] <valorie> GREAT\n'
p95
aS"[06:45] <valorie> gosh, I wonder what we'll discuss?\n"
p96
aS'[06:45] <mgraesslin> yeah - the large KDE family reunion - once a year in Europe\n'
p97
aS'[06:45] <valorie> :-)\n'
p98
aS"[06:45] <valorie> that's how it feels, for sure\n"
p99
aS'[06:45] <smartboyhw> valorie, how to break down Mir?\n'
p100
aS"[06:46] <mgraesslin> smartboyhw: let's be positive: how to transit to Wayland\n"
p101
aS"[06:46] <valorie> I'll make a target, call it MIR and pin it to Martin's back~\n"
p102
aS"[06:46] <valorie> yes, let's be positive\n"
p103
aS'[06:47] <valorie> the Mir discussions/flamewars are fun and all\n'
p104
aS'[06:47] <mgraesslin> not really\n'
p105
aS'[06:47] <valorie> but beginning to get a bit tedious\n'
p106
aS'[06:47] <mgraesslin> I find it very exhausting\n'
p107
aS'[06:47] <valorie> well, you are on the front line\n'
p108
aS"[06:47] <mgraesslin> and I don't want to be\n"
p109
aS"[06:47] <valorie> and damn it, I don't want there to be a war\n"

p115
aS"[06:48] <smartboyhw> Holy, it's starting to rain big here.\n"
p116
aS"[06:48] <mgraesslin> well I hope that at least we don't get that much from Canonical any more - I asked to respect our decision and to not try to put the blame on us\n"
p117
aS'[06:48] <smartboyhw> We got a tropical cyclone coming in (fortunately, not worse than originally forecasted)\n'
p118
aS'[06:49] <valorie> mgraesslin: indeed\n'
p119
aS"[06:49] <valorie> they can do as they like, even if i disagree that that's a good direction\n"
p120
aS'[06:49] <valorie> I even see their reasoning\n'
p121
aS"[06:49] <mgraesslin> exactly - I don't question their decision\n"
p122
aS'[06:49] <mgraesslin> so they should not question our decision\n'
p123
aS'[06:49] <valorie> but I wish they had more of an open mind about the ramifications\n'
p124
aS'[06:50] <valorie> they seem to have tunnel vision so far\n'
p125
aS'[06:50] <valorie> not healthy\n'
p126

p131
aS'[06:52] <valorie> it takes all the flavors, etc.\n'
p132
aS'[06:52] <smartboyhw> Basically, it is a introduction to running through testing an ISO.\n'
p133
aS'[06:52] <valorie> cool\n'
p134
aS'[06:52] <smartboyhw> Fortunately, unlike last time, I prepared slideshows:)\n'

p136
aS'[06:53] <smartboyhw> It was difficult to teach without screenshots...\n'

aS"[08:04] <valorie> well, I'm an artist along with my other interests\n"
p251
aS'[08:04] <valorie> I make amazing paper\n'

p253
aS'[08:06] <valorie> not so much in programming languages though\n'

p255
aS"[08:07] <valorie> I've been online longer than you've been alive!\n"
p256
aS'[08:07] <smartboyhw> valorie, I know.\n'

p258
aS'[08:09] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: looks good, uploading\n'
p259
aS'[08:10] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, thanks.\n'
p260
aS"[08:11] <valorie> no argument; you are so much smarter than I was, that I'm blown away\n"
p261
aS'[08:11] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, maybe review libkfbapi in the same PPA also?\n'
p262
aS'[08:12] <shadeslayer> ack\n'
p263
aS"[08:12] <valorie> after I hung out in this channel for a month or two and figured out that kubuntu was made by teenagers, I just couldn't believe it\n"

aS"[08:12] <smartboyhw> Don't touch simon, I haven't done the changes upstream wanted\n"
p265
aS'[08:12] <shadeslayer> was going to be my next question :)\n'
p266
aS'[08:12] <smartboyhw> valorie, well wait a minute, "teenagers" in your mind = ? age?\n'
p267
aS'[08:12] <shadeslayer> people in their teens ? :P\n'
p268
aS'[08:12] <valorie> teens are say, 12-20\n'
p269
aS'[08:13] <valorie> some might have aged into their 20s\n'
p270
aS'[08:13] <smartboyhw> valorie, OK, I\'m a teen for sure but Riddell or ScottK isn\'t really a "TEEN" right?\n'
p271
aS'[08:13] <valorie> I guess Riddell is the father figure, and ScottK and I are the grandparents\n'
p272
aS'[08:13] <smartboyhw> Eh, simon has a LOT of --list-missing files\n'

p307
aS'[08:20] <valorie> thanks mgraesslin\n'
p308
aS'[08:21] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: why not use ~ppaX\n'
p309
aS'[08:21] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, to make the uploader more convenient?\n'
p310
aS'[08:21] <smartboyhw> I mean, I only use ~ppaX when in Kubuntu PPAs.\n'

p335
aS'[08:35] <smartboyhw> This is going to be a big project it seems.\n'
p336
aS'[08:35] <shadeslayer> think about why a -dev package needs shipping for an app\n'
p337
aS'[08:36] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, why? :P\n'
p338
aS'[08:36] <shadeslayer> exactly, why?\n'
p339
aS"[08:36] <smartboyhw> Because you can't work without it.\n"
p340
aS'[08:36] <shadeslayer> and there is no lib for simon?\n'

p358
aS'[08:38] <yofel> what do you need to ship the headers for anyway?\n'
p359
aS'[08:39] <shadeslayer> my original question ^^\n'
p360
aS'[08:39] <yofel> because either leave it like it is or do it properly\n'
p361
aS"[08:39] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel the question is: The headers aren't even shipped in 0.4.0...\n"
p362
aS'[08:39] <yofel> latter might not be possible if I see stuff like libeventsimulation\n'
p363
aS'[08:39] <smartboyhw> packaging I mean\n'
p364
aS"[08:39] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: yeah, I don't think it's required to ship those headers\n"
p365
aS'[08:40] <shadeslayer> I doubt anything uses them\n'
p366
aS'[08:40] <shadeslayer> W: kactivities source: intra-source-package-circular-dependency libkactivities-bin libkactivities-models1 libkactivities6\n'
p367
aS"[08:40] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, but why we shouldn't?\n"
p368
aS'[08:40] <shadeslayer> hehe\n'
p369
aS'[08:40] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, hehe\n'
p370
aS'[08:41] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: there is no reason to ship them\n'
p371
aS'[08:41] <shadeslayer> btw I just realized, there are no symbols for libkfbapi\n'
p372
aS'[08:41] <shadeslayer> we should probably introduce some\n'
p373
aS'[08:41] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, alright, have you uploaded it yet?\n'
p374
aS'[08:42] <smartboyhw> If yes, -0ubuntu2 will be needed\n'
p375
aS'[08:42] <shadeslayer> yeah, already uploaded\n'
p376
aS'[08:42] <shadeslayer> no big deal, we can introduce them with another upload\n'
p377
aS'[08:42] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, uh, does this include the headers?\n'
p378
aS'[08:42] <smartboyhw> However, one small thing: Many packages (the ones for Ubuntu and\n'
p379
aS'[08:42] <smartboyhw> OpenSUSE, for example) omitted some key data files from the final\n'
p380
aS'[08:42] <smartboyhw> packages (prompts files, general scenario, etc.) without which Simon\n'
p381
aS'[08:42] <smartboyhw> 0.4.0 "crashes" immediately after startup (i.e., shows a fatal error and\n'
p382
aS'[08:42] <smartboyhw> quits).\n'
p383
aS'[08:43] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: did you rebuild akonadi-facebook against the new libkfbapi btw?\n'
p384
aS'[08:43] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, not yet.\n'
p385
aS'[08:43] <shadeslayer> is there a new release for that as well?\n'
p386
aS'[08:43] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, never heard of.\n'
p387
aS'[08:43]  * smartboyhw checks\n'
p388
aS"[08:45] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, um, it's in kdepim-runtime it seems\n"
p389
aS'[08:45] <shadeslayer> ah yes\n'
p390
aS'[08:45] <smartboyhw> So, rebuild that?\n'
p391
aS'[08:45] <shadeslayer> probably time to retire akonadi-facebook thne\n'
p392
aS'[08:45] <shadeslayer> *then\n'
p393
aS"[08:46] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, you haven't answered my question yet:)\n"
p394
aS"[08:46] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: which one? I didn't quite get the last question\n"
p395
aS'[08:47] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, uh, does this include the headers one, with the upstream instructions below\n'
p396
aS'[08:47] <shadeslayer> nope\n'
p397
aS'[08:47] <shadeslayer> data files are usually arch independent files\n'
p398
aS'[08:47] <shadeslayer> like images\n'
p399
aS"[08:48] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, hmm, I can't find it with dh_install --list-missing...\n"
p400
aS'[08:49] <shadeslayer> where is this written?\n'
p401
aS'[08:49] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, kde-packagers mailing list\n'
p402
aS'[08:49] <shadeslayer> and check debian/not-installed\n'
p403
aS'[08:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, no such file?\n'
p404
aS'[08:51] <shadeslayer> then it seems like everything was installed?\n'
p405
aS'[08:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yeah\n'
p406
aS'[08:52] <shadeslayer> lemme check if Peter is around\n'
p407
aS'[08:57] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, why dpkg-gencontrol: warning: Pre-Depends field of package unknown substitution variable ${misc:Pre-Depends} ?\n'
p408
aS"[08:57] <smartboyhw> It's in libkfbapi1-dev\n"
p409
aS'[08:57] <smartboyhw> Oops libkfbapi1\n'
p410
aS"[08:57] <shadeslayer> lintian didn't warn me of that here\n"
p411
aS'[08:57] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, not  lintian\n'
p412
aS'[08:57] <smartboyhw> dpkg-gencontrol\n'
p413
aS'[08:57] <smartboyhw> lintian should have NO warnings\n'
p414
aS'[08:57] <smartboyhw> :P\n'
p415
aS'[08:57] <shadeslayer> Riddell might know\n'
p416
aS"[08:58] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, and also, packages with Architectures: all shouldn't have {shlibs:Depends} as Depends: right?\n"
p417
aS'[08:59] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: why not?\n'
p418
aS"[08:59] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, it says that it's unknown variable...\n"
p419
aS'[08:59] <yofel> shlibs:Depends is not generated for arch:all\n'
p420
aS'[08:59] <smartboyhw> yofel, so remove\n'
p421
aS'[08:59] <smartboyhw> ?\n'
p422
aS'[09:00] <shadeslayer> wait, arch:all = arch independent package?\n'
p423
aS'[09:00] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yeah\n'
p424
aS'[09:00] <yofel> right\n'
p425
aS'[09:00] <shadeslayer> I always get confused :/\n'
p426
aS'[09:00] <shadeslayer> okay they yeah, can be dropped\n'
p427
aS'[09:00] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: though check what Debian did\n'
p428
aS"[09:00] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, debian doesn't have that package I think\n"

aS'[09:13] <yofel> you can use apt-file to look for files btw.\n'
p482
aS'[09:13] <smartboyhw> Who invented such a strange package!?!?!/\n'
p483
aS'[09:13] <yofel> which one?\n'
p484
aS'[09:13] <smartboyhw> yofel, libsm-dev (the name)\n'
p485
aS"[09:14] <yofel> uh, that's a bit unlucky short naming I guess :P\n"
p486
aS'[09:14] <smartboyhw> I rather like libsessionmanagement:P\n'
p487
aS'[09:14] <smartboyhw> tester56, is it going better now?\n'
p488
aS'[09:15] <tester56> yeah ... it compiled :-))\n'
p489
aS'[09:15] <smartboyhw> tester56, great\n'
p490
aS'[09:16] <tester56> thanks for your great help!\n'
p491
aS'[09:16] <smartboyhw> tester56, our pleasure:)\n'
p492
aS'[09:17] <smartboyhw> That guy should really invent a README though\n'
p493
aS'[09:17] <smartboyhw> Who makes software without README(s)?\n'
p494
aS'[09:17] <yofel> developers ;P\n'
p495
aS'[09:17] <smartboyhw> yofel, ;P\n'
p496
aS'[09:17] <tester56> but he made a WHY DESIGN and COPYING \n'
p497
aS"[09:18]  * smartboyhw is thinking should he wait for Riddell's response on {shlibs:Pre-Depends} or just upload with the symbols\n"
p498
aS"[09:18] <smartboyhw> tester56, but he didn't even tell people HOWTO compile.\n"
p499
aS"[09:19] <smartboyhw> That's stupid:P\n"
p500
aS'[09:20] <tester56> hopefully my session starts again after installing :D\n'
p501
aS"[09:20] <tester56> but it's a dev install anyway\n"
p502
aS'[09:20] <smartboyhw> tester56, yeah, if it breaks, uh oh:)\n'
p503
aS'[09:20] <tester56> no risk no fun :D\n'
p504
aS'[09:21] <smartboyhw> yofel, how do you guys make new project-neon packages? (/me wants to play with sessionk:P)\n'
p505
aS'[09:21] <tester56> would be great if it could be included in project neon ... would make things easier\n'
p506
aS'[09:21] <tester56> make as an optional package\n'
p507
aS'[09:22] <tester56> *maybe\n'
p508
aS"[09:22] <yofel> well, that's trivial as it's mostly scripted anyway. Where's the repository again?\n"
p509
aS'[09:22] <smartboyhw> yofel, http://quickgit.kde.org/?p=scratch%2Fdantti%2Fsessionk.git\n'
p510
aS'[09:22]  * smartboyhw wants to run the script...\n'
p511
aS'[09:23] <yofel> make Quintasan or apachelogger add you to ~neon\n'
p512
aS'[09:24]  * smartboyhw waits then...\n'
p513
aS'[09:24] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, apachelogger put me into ~neon please:)\n'
p514
aS'[09:24] <tester56> no way back now ... is installled \n'
p515
aS'[09:25] <tester56> i will logout now ... c ya and thanks!\n'
p516
aS'[09:31] <tester56> here again ... it seems to be installed but seems to use the default way of starting \n'
p517
aS'[09:31] <tester56> at least it uses the normal splash screen\n'
p518
aS'[09:31] <tester56> which should not be the case\n'
p519
aS'[09:32] <tester56> is there a way to "activate" sessionk?\n'
p520
aS'[09:33] <yofel> it seems to have its own session name\n'
p521
aS'[09:33] <yofel> KDE Plasma Workspace (sessionk)\n'
p522
aS'[09:33] <tester56> oh ... did not notice that ...\n'
p523
aS'[09:33] <tester56> gonna try now\n'
p524
aS'[09:35] <tester56> not in my case ... at least lightdm gives me no option to choose\n'
p525
aS'[09:35] <smartboyhw> tester56, have you run sudo make install after compiling?\n'
p526
aS'[09:35] <tester56> yeah\n'
p527
aS'[09:35] <smartboyhw> tester56, hm\n'
p528
aS'[09:35] <yofel> wrong desktop file location probably\n'
p529
aS'[09:35] <tester56> how to fix that?\n'
p530
aS'[09:36] <yofel> try this: edit the sessionk paths in src/kde-plasma-sk.desktop from /usr to /usr/local/\n'
p531
aS'[09:36] <yofel> then copy the file to /usr/share/xsessions/\n'
p532
aS'[09:37] <tester56> Exec=/usr/bin/sessionk to Exec=/usr/local/sessionk ?\n'
p533
aS"[09:37] <Riddell> smartboyhw: what's that about the symbols?\n"
p534
aS'[09:37] <yofel>  /usr/local/bin/sessionk\n'
p535
aS"[09:37] <smartboyhw> Riddell, shadeslayer said that libkfbapi doesn't have any symbols, and told me to add some.\n"
p536
aS"[09:37] <yofel> not sure if that'll work but I hope so\n"
p537
aS"[09:38] <smartboyhw> Meanwhile, libkfbapi says that for the Pre-Depends field ${misc:Pre-Depends} doesn't exist\n"
p538
aS'[09:38] <tester56> yofel: no recompiling?\n'
p539
aS'[09:38] <Riddell> smartboyhw: sounds like good advice\n'
p540
aS'[09:38] <yofel> no\n'
p541
aS'[09:38] <smartboyhw> Riddell, about the "Pre-Depends", what is the correct fix?\n'
p542
aS'[09:39] <Riddell> smartboyhw: umm, add it?\n'
p543
aS'[09:40] <smartboyhw> Riddell, no, I mean, dpkg-gencontrol: warning: Pre-Depends field of package libkfbapi1: unknown substitution variable ${misc:Pre-Depends}\n'

aS'[09:40] <smartboyhw> Sorry guys\n'
p549
aS'[09:40] <smartboyhw> :P\n'
p550
aS'[09:40] <Riddell> nice recovery :)\n'
p551
aS'[09:40] <Riddell> smartboyhw: why does it have a pre-depends field?\n'
p552
aS'[09:40] <smartboyhw> Riddell, :)\n'
p553
aS'[09:41] <smartboyhw> Riddell, well, you added it:P\n'
p554
aS'[09:41] <Riddell> is it used?\n'
p555
aS'[09:41] <smartboyhw> Riddell, how to tell?\n'
p556
aS"[09:42] <Riddell> smartboyhw: well look at it? what's in debian/control?\n"
p557
aS"[09:42] <smartboyhw> Riddell, there's the Pre-Depends field\n"
p558
aS'[09:42] <smartboyhw> in libkfbapi\n'
p559
aS'[09:42] <smartboyhw> 1\n'
p560
aS'[09:43] <smartboyhw> with ${misc:Pre-Depends}\n'
p561
aS'[09:43] <Riddell> and does it pre-depend on?\n'
p562
aS'[09:43] <smartboyhw> Riddell, yeah\n'
p563
aS'[09:43] <Riddell> just delete it then\n'
p564
aS"[09:43] <tester56> damn ... it's blazing fast :-))) yeah\n"
p565
aS'[09:44] <smartboyhw> tester56, great:)\n'
p566
aS"[09:44] <smartboyhw> Now yofel I think since you have commit access you'll have to do it:P\n"
p567
aS'[09:44] <smartboyhw> Change the /usr/local/ in the kde branch:)\n'
p568
aS"[09:45] <yofel> not really, it's just only meant for system installs\n"
p569
aS"[09:45] <yofel> i'll have to patch and rename that for neon too\n"
p570
aS'[09:45] <tester56> things look a little bit different in the session though \n'
p571
aS'[09:46] <tester56> the fonts look different, appmenu is not working etc.\n'
p572
aS"[09:46] <smartboyhw> tester56, well come on, it's a new project!\n"
p573
aS'[09:46] <tester56> i know ... i am quite happy someone got plasma starting that fast :D\n'
p574
aS"[09:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, review time: https://launchpad.net/~smartboyhw/+archive/ppa/+files/libkfbapi_1.0-0ubuntu2.dsc (and also, how's the asking to Peter about simon?)\n"
p575
aS'[09:51] <guest-VAsONf> tester56 here from guest session ... it seems some services are not started\n'
p576
aS'[09:51] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: Riddell fwiw I recompiled akonadi-facebook locally and it compiles fine\n'
p577
aS'[09:51] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, great. Review the one with symbols plz:) ^\n'
p578
aS'[09:51] <shadeslayer> + against new libkfbapi\n'
p579
aS'[09:52] <guest-VAsONf> when i am trying to configure the services it says: unable to contact kded which is quite logical considering the design of sessionk\n'
p580
aS'[09:53] <smartboyhw> guest-VAsONf, well try contact the dev of sessionk will be better:)\n'
p581
aS'[09:54] <guest-VAsONf> yeah ... he was in this channel yesterday\n'
p582
aS"[09:54] <smartboyhw> guest-VAsONf, try in #kde-devel. Or maybe he just hasn't waken up yet.\n"
p583
aS'[09:55] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: looks good to me\n'
p584
aS'[09:56] <guest-VAsONf> but i have to say i am very happy ... this looks very promising to me\n'
p585
aS'[09:57] <shadeslayer> afiestas_: btw I can confirm that splash-being-killed-before-plasma-is-started bug\n'
p586
aS'[09:57]  * guest-VAsONf too\n'
p587
aS'[09:58] <afiestas_> shadeslayer: I know that far\n'

p633

p634
aS"[10:12] <Quintasan> I so don't want to learn\n"
p635
aS'[10:13] <Quintasan> Hmm\n'
p636
aS'[10:13]  * Quintasan heads off\n'
p637
aS'[10:13] <Quintasan> I have a brilliant idea\n'
p638
aS'[10:15] <shadeslayer> I have no motivation to package 4.10.5\n'
p639
aS"[10:15] <shadeslayer> instead, I'll backport 4.10.90 to quantal :P\n"
p640
aS'[10:15] <Quintasan> JontheEchidna: Can you make it so that Muon Software Updater does NOT show and Updates available notification when the window is active?\n'
p641
aS'[10:17] <shadeslayer> any ideas how I can make bzr not try and use my ssh key to branch ?\n'
p642
aS'[10:19] <shadeslayer> bleh\n'
p643
aS'[10:19] <shadeslayer> just delete ~/.bazaar\n'
p644
aS'[10:20] <shadeslayer> yofel: which boost version is required on quantal?\n'
p645
aS"[10:20] <yofel> copy the raring script, it's 1.49 too\n"
p646
aS'[10:21] <shadeslayer> ah cool\n'
p647
aS"[10:21] <shadeslayer> yofel: and what's with libgpgme++2.install ?\n"
p648
aS"[10:21] <yofel> you'll need that too\n"
p649
aS'[10:22] <shadeslayer> the kdepimlibs-raring script\n'
p650
aS"[10:22] <yofel> I think you'll need all quantal and raring scripts\n"
p651
aS'[10:23] <shadeslayer> sure, but whats teh deal with libgpgme?\n'
p652
aS'[10:23] <yofel> new version in saucy removed something\n'
p653
aS"[10:23] <yofel> there's a debian bug report somewhere\n"
p654
aS'[10:25] <shadeslayer> what fun\n'
p655
aS'[10:25] <shadeslayer> I ran the backport script to backport from raring to quantal and it starts backporting 4.10.5\n'
p656
aS'[10:26] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, srsly? Bp to precise first?\n'
p657
aS'[10:27] <smartboyhw> lol\n'
p658
aS'[10:28] <shadeslayer> okay, so I also need to manipulate other files\n'
p659
aS'[10:33] <yofel> shadeslayer: er yeah, default is ninjas and stable ^^\n'
p660
aS"[10:33] <yofel> there's options for that\n"
p661
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p662
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> adjusted some things\n'
p663
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> for eg backport list was outdated\n'
p664
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> and also copied over kdesc-dev-latest from saucy\n'
p665
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> erm, raring\n'
p666
aS'[10:33] <shadeslayer> not saucy\n'
p667
aS'[10:36] <yofel> brrrrrr\n'
p668
aS'[10:37] <yofel> I forgot about backport list handling -.-\n'
p669
aS'[10:37] <shadeslayer> ?\n'
p670
aS'[10:37] <yofel> that needs to be seperated too\n'
p671
aS'[10:37] <shadeslayer> ah\n'
p672
aS"[10:37] <yofel> anyway, I'll fix that later\n"
p673
aS'[10:38] <shadeslayer> any reason why we have separate backport lists for each release?\n'
p674
aS'[10:47] <tsdgeos> guys my lokalize 4.10.90 depends on kdesdk-strigi-plugins 4.10.4\n'

p676
aS'[10:50] <tsdgeos> http://paste.kde.org/~tsdgeos/786266/\n'
p677
aS'[10:50] <shadeslayer> atleast on saucy it depends on kdesdk-strigi-plugins\n'
p678
aS'[10:50] <shadeslayer> no versioning\n'
p679
aS'[10:51] <shadeslayer> tsdgeos: what does apt-cache policy kdesdk-strigi-plugins say?\n'
p680

p686
aS"[10:52] <yofel> it's not in the archive it seems o.O\n"
p687
aS'[10:52] <shadeslayer> eh\n'
p688
aS'[10:52] <shadeslayer> probably in new\n'
p689
aS'[10:52] <shadeslayer> yep\n'
p690
aS'[10:53] <shadeslayer> Riddell: ^^ kdesdk-strigi-analyzers are in new\n'
p691
aS'[10:53] <shadeslayer> plz be doing your thing :)\n'
p692
aS"[10:54] <tsdgeos> and it'd be cool if you guys could rebuild kdevelop in saucy so it doesn't depend on libkasten2controllers2/libkasten2okteta1controllers1 but in the new versions\n"

p700
aS'[11:05] <bedahr> alright, great\n'
p701
aS'[11:05] <shadeslayer> bedahr: I think it was about the missing data files you mentioned in kde-packagers\n'
p702
aS'[11:05] <shadeslayer> AFAICT all files that make install installs are shipped\n'
p703
aS"[11:07] <bedahr> no, they weren't in the earlier release\n"

aS'[13:19] <apachelogger> which defeats the purpose IMO\n'
p939
aS'[13:19] <soee> what is this update exactly ?\n'
p940
aS'[13:19] <shadeslayer> soee: no difference\n'
p941
aS'[13:19] <shadeslayer> soee: just an upgrade from the PPA to the archive version\n'
p942
aS'[13:19] <apachelogger> i.e. the assumption is that upstream does loads of release QA and is trustworthy enough to not break stuff etc.\n'
p943
aS'[13:19] <soee> shadeslayer, should i do this upgrade ?\n'
p944
aS"[13:19] <apachelogger> but with upstream != releaser that assumption doesn't hold anymore\n"
p945
aS"[13:20] <shadeslayer> soee: I don't see why not\n"
p946
aS"[13:20] <apachelogger> so IMO snapshots generally shouldn't get an exception, at least not if all we ever had in the archive was a snapshot\n"

aS'[13:21] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: well it happened to me, I thought it was just some odd problem with my qmake hacks and whatnot\n'
p955
aS'[13:22] <shadeslayer> kdepim-runtime 4.11 has akonadi-facebook baked in \n'
p956
aS'[13:22] <apachelogger> that explains why amd64 aborted\n'

p984

p997
aS"[13:52] <apachelogger> also that behavior doesn't make sense either\n"
p998
aS'[13:52] <apachelogger> LANG=C ought to force the language embedded in the binary\n'

aS'[13:52] <apachelogger> i.e. the original strings\n'
p1000
aS'[13:52] <apachelogger> if that is french then the output will be french\n'
p1001
aS'[13:52] <apachelogger> it just happens to be en_US so it is roughy equal to LANG=en_US\n'
p1002
aS"[13:53] <apachelogger> so assuming ls doesn't have native french strings the behavior is weird :S\n"
p1003
aS'[13:54] <agateau> heh, because of course, it should!\n'

p1012
aS'[13:57] <shadeslayer> okay\n'
p1013
aS'[14:01] <shadeslayer> will be back in a bit\n'
p1014

p1015
aS'[14:20] <apachelogger> y?\n'
p1016
aS'[14:20] <shadeslayer> because the akonadi-facebook package ships only one binary\n'
p1017
aS'[14:21] <shadeslayer> hmm\n'
p1018
aS'[14:21] <shadeslayer> I could add the transitional binary to kdepim-runtime\n'
p1019
aS'[14:21] <shadeslayer> and break/replace on akonadi-facebook < 4.10.90\n'

p1192
aS"[20:42] <ahoneybun> yet I'm working on the Docs lol\n"
p1193
aS'[20:44] <jono> ahoneybun, I think Mir is good - diversity is always a good thing in Free Software, and the Mir team have done a good job being open since the announcement\n'
p1194
aS'[20:44] <jono> and I just tested Mir in 13.10 and it works pretty well\n'
p1195
aS'[20:44] <ahoneybun> I just think it is weird for us to hear nothing about Mir till just a few months ago\n'
p1196
aS'[20:45] <yofel> well, on my eeePC XMir does kinda, somewhat run a kubuntu-session. more or less. Need to do more debugging if I can\n'

p1207
aS'[20:48] <jono> ahoneybun, I wish it could have been announced earlier, but it is what it is\n'
p1208
aS'[20:49] <jono> I actually think Mir could be good for Kubuntu\n'
p1209
aS'[20:49] <ahoneybun> jono: I just hope we can get all the technolgies to work together later on\n'
p1210
aS'[20:49] <jono> XMir already works pretty well, and XMir and Mir will be well supported\n'

p1215
aS"[20:50] <ahoneybun> jono: I don't know if I should back Wayland or Mir. Wayland's development seems slow but great things come in time\n"
p1216
aS'[20:51] <jono> ahoneybun, I think you should back them both\n'
p1217
aS'[20:51] <jono> both are great projects\n'
p1218
aS"[20:51] <yofel> slow is subjective here. If wayland would't have existed in an experimental project, Mir would've come far later\n"
p1219
aS"[20:52] <jono> yofel, agreed, but if Mir wasn't happening, I don't think Wayland would have seen some of the increased work recently\n"
p1220
aS'[20:52] <jono> everything is relative\n'
p1221
aS'[20:52] <yofel> it\'s fine going your own ways, just please don\'t offer a "somewhat working compatibility layer" and belive everyone will happyily use it\n'
p1222
aS'[20:52] <yofel> yeah, true\n'
p1223
aS"[20:52] <ahoneybun> yea but I don't like how Mir is dividing us up\n"
p1224
aS"[20:53] <yofel> this was a marketing mess. If we're talking about division, then surfaceflinger from google already divided linux\n"
p1225
aS"[20:53] <yofel> so it's not like canonical does something completely new and strange\n"
p1226
aS'[20:53] <jono> yofel, I never said I expect everyone to use it, and the compatibility layer, to be fair, is X\n'
p1227
aS'[20:53] <jono> Mir is simply providing another alternative\n'
p1228
aS'[20:54] <jono> in the same way Kubuntu provides an alternative to Ubuntu\n'
p1229
aS'[20:54] <jono> I personally think Mir will be good overall, it will be fast and efficient and ship soon\n'
p1230
aS'[20:54] <jono> but I understand how upstream is still assessing things\n'
p1231
aS'[20:55] <ahoneybun> jono: tbh if Ubuntu did not use compiz and Unity was something other then a addon to compiz I think it would be better\n'
p1232
aS'[20:55] <jono> ahoneybun, how is Unity using compiz an issue?\n'
p1233
aS'[20:55] <jono> it is simply a rendering framework\n'
p1234
aS"[20:55] <ahoneybun> jono: if it can bring that and a great layer for Kubutu and other buntu's to use then I will support Mir\n"
p1235

p1236
aS'[20:56] <jono> ahoneybun, why?\n'
p1237

p1238
aS'[20:56] <yofel> uhm, no, not really\n'
p1239
aS'[20:56] <jono> ahoneybun, we are not fans of compiz either, hence Mir\n'
p1240
aS'[20:56] <yofel> I already had compiz working better on my netbook than kwin in the past\n'
p1241
aS'[20:56] <ahoneybun> to me it is \n'
p1242
aS'[20:57] <ahoneybun> jono: what will Mir do to compiz?\n'
p1243
aS"[20:57] <yofel> I don't have  a current opinion as that was like 4 years ago\n"
p1244
aS"[20:58] <jono> ahoneybun, compiz won't be used with Mir\n"
p1245
aS'[20:58] <jono> there will be no more compiz in the Ubuntu stack\n'
p1246
aS'[20:58] <ahoneybun> jono: what window manager?\n'
p1247
aS'[20:58] <jono> for 13.10 it will be Unity + Compiz + Mir\n'
p1248
aS'[20:59] <jono> in 14.04 it will be Unity + Mir\n'
p1249
aS'[20:59] <jono> ahoneybun, Unity is a window manager\n'
p1250
aS'[20:59] <ahoneybun> wait...\n'
p1251
aS'[21:00] <ahoneybun> compiz is a windows manager and unity is add-on to it\n'
p1252
aS'[21:00] <ahoneybun> no?\n'
p1253
aS'[21:01] <yofel> jono: OT question: is there any chance that when asking one could rename the mir process from unity-system-compositor to something else?\n'
p1254
aS"[21:01] <yofel> I don't care much about the software I'm using, but if in the end everyone - not only unity - is *supposed* to use it then that's more than a bit misnamed\n"
p1255
aS'[21:02] <jono> ahoneybun, right, but Unity 8 is a totally different codebase to Unity 7\n'
p1256
aS'[21:02] <jono> there will be no more compiz\n'
p1257
aS'[21:02] <ahoneybun> jono: really? all new? not a add-on anymore?\n'
p1258
aS'[21:02] <jono> yofel, I thought the same thing, can you file a bug against Mir in Launchpad for that?\n'
p1259
aS'[21:02] <jono> ahoneybun, yes!\n'
p1260
aS'[21:02] <ahoneybun> jono: that is amazing news to me\n'
p1261
aS'[21:02] <yofel> will do\n'
p1262
aS'[21:03] <jono> ahoneybun, Unity 8 is a converged Unity, so when it runs on the phone you get the phone UI, and when it runs on Desktop you get the Desktop UI\n'
p1263
aS'[21:03] <jono> ahoneybun, written in Qt/QML and running on Mir\n'
p1264
aS'[21:03] <jono> thanks yofel, throw me a link when done\n'
p1265
aS'[21:03] <ahoneybun> jono: yes I was like OMG when I heard Qt.\n'
p1266
aS'[21:03] <ahoneybun> I was like finally\n'
p1267
aS'[21:04] <jono> ahoneybun, so according to your view earlier, you should be now supportive of Mir :-)\n'

p1442
aS'[15:12] <tester56> i suppose no\n'

aS'[15:13] <tester56> the thing is: the script gets called two different times ... and i suppose one time sth. is wrong\n'

p1448
aS'[15:14] <akoma1s> the #! line\n'

aS'[15:15] <tester56> and then?\n'
p1450
aS'[15:15] <akoma1s> and replug the power adapter\n'

aS'[15:16] <akoma1s> afterwards check /tmp for myscript.*.log files\n'
p1452
aS'[15:16] <tester56> no change\n'
p1453
aS'[15:17] <tester56> logfiles are emtpy\n'
p1454
aS'[15:17] <tester56> very strange\n'
p1455
aS'[15:17] <tester56> at least it should complain about missing rights\n'
p1456
aS'[15:18] <akoma1s> indeed :/\n'
p1457
aS'[15:18] <tester56> any other idea?\n'
p1458
aS'[15:18] <akoma1s> could you check if there is a space character right before the "#!" ?\n'
p1459
aS"[15:18] <akoma1s> it shouldn't matter however\n"
p1460
aS'[15:18] <tester56> yeah there is one\n'
p1461
aS'[15:19] <akoma1s> try removing it\n'
p1462
aS'[15:19] <akoma1s> you were lucky it ran at all :)\n'
p1463
aS'[15:19] <tester56> no :-(((\n'
p1464
aS'[15:19] <tester56> no change\n'
p1465
aS'[15:19] <akoma1s> sigh\n'
p1466
aS'[15:19] <tester56> what could be wrong?\n'
p1467
aS"[15:20] <akoma1s> try changing the echo 'min_power' in the first section to echo 'garbage', just so can be sure we get the error messages logged\n"
p1468
aS'[15:20] <akoma1s> so we*\n'
p1469
aS'[15:22] <tester56>  /etc/pm/power.d/powertop.sh: line 12: echo: write error: Invalid argument\n'
p1470
aS'[15:23] <tester56> is there a way to check if it gets applied and is then overwritten by the hardware instantly for any reason?\n'
p1471
aS'[15:23] <tester56> but it has to be the hardware that overwrites, otherwise we would see an error message\n'
p1472
aS'[15:25] <akoma1s> ...or the kernel, for some reason\n'
p1473
aS"[15:25] <akoma1s> there may be, I'm looking into it\n"
p1474
aS"[15:25] <akoma1s> normally you'd use inotify\n"
p1475
aS'[15:26] <tester56> can you reproduce the issue on your machine?\n'
p1476
aS"[15:27] <akoma1s> that's the next item on the plan :)\n"
p1477
aS'[15:29] <tester56> but if the kernel would overwrite it ... why not overwriting when manually appling too?\n'
p1478
aS'[15:30] <akoma1s> heh, just noticed the /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/sata_alpm file\n'
p1479
aS'[15:30] <akoma1s> this may be the culprit\n'
p1480
aS'[15:31] <tester56> true) [ "$SATA_ALPM_ENABLE" = true ] && set_sata_alpm min_power;;\n'
p1481
aS'[15:31] <tester56>  39     false) set_sata_alpm max_performance;;\n'
p1482
aS'[15:31] <tester56> *without the 39\n'
p1483
aS'[15:32] <tester56> sound very promising :-))\n'
p1484
aS'[15:32] <akoma1s> yeah, looking for the correct place to set the SATA_ALPM_ENABLE variable now :)\n'
p1485
aS'[15:32] <tester56> and let me guess ... that script is executed after my script?\n'
p1486
aS'[15:33] <tester56> this would explain why my script does not work, does not matter how long I sleep\n'
p1487
aS'[15:33] <akoma1s> powertop.sh sorts before sata_alpm\n'
p1488
aS'[15:33] <tester56> so it is pm-utils itself preventing the script from working, right?\n'
p1489
aS"[15:34] <akoma1s> so probably it's running after your script, indeed\n"
p1490
aS"[15:34] <akoma1s> yes, but I wouldn't advise removing it :)\n"
p1491
aS'[15:34] <tester56> that behaviour should be changed ... why writing a script when it get changed again\n'
p1492
aS'[15:35] <tester56> okay it does not matter ... the main thing is that everything works when the power source is unplugged\n'
p1493
aS"[15:35] <tester56> I'll leave it there, now where we have found the reason\n"
p1494
aS'[15:36] <tester56> sure this is the reason?\n'
p1495
aS'[15:37] <akoma1s> moving it out of the way temporarily\n'
p1496
aS'[15:37] <akoma1s> try moving*\n'
p1497
aS'[15:38] <tester56> haha ... moving it out of the way works :-))))))))\n'
p1498
aS'[15:40] <tester56> i suppose the other files are responsible for the other problems\n'
p1499
aS'[15:40] <tester56> so now it would be nice to find a way to change the priority of the scripts\n'
p1500
aS'[15:41] <tester56> or should I place my scipt in /usr/lib/pm-utils/power.d/ ?\n'
p1501
aS'[15:41] <akoma1s> an easy way out could be renaming your script to zzz_powertop.sh\n'
p1502
aS'[15:42] <akoma1s> so it sorts last of all other scripts\n'
p1503
aS'[15:45] <tester56> solves all issues apart from line 5\n'
p1504
aS'[15:45] <tester56> so there is another part involved :-(\n'
p1505
aS'[15:45] <akoma1s> the "iw dev wlan0 set power_save off" ?\n'
p1506
aS'[15:46] <tester56> yeah\n'
p1507
aS'[15:46] <akoma1s> does this work when running it by hand?\n'
p1508
aS'[15:46] <tester56> yeah\n'
p1509

aS"[11:28] <Riddell> I think it's much nicer being integrated in, but it probably won't be as reliable at doing everything right\n"
p1798
aS"[11:29] <apachelogger> well, we need additional backing logic and some thigns simply don't map from a KDE perspective\n"

aS'[11:29] <apachelogger> e.g. locale formats\n'

aS'[11:29] <apachelogger> in KDE you can define semi-arbitrary combinations\n'

aS"[11:29] <apachelogger> posix doesn't have this flexibility\n"
p1802
aS'[11:29] <apachelogger> so\n'
p1803
aS'[11:30] <apachelogger> what we could do is introduce a new tab for system language configuration\n'
p1804
aS'[11:30] <apachelogger> or rather a new kcm I guess\n'
p1805
aS'[11:31] <apachelogger> right now you have no UI way to configure the global language anyway\n'
p1806
aS"[11:31] <Riddell> that's just what language-selector was\n"
p1807
aS'[11:31] <Riddell> we might as well go back to language-selector if we do that\n'
p1808
aS'[11:31] <apachelogger> yeah\n'
p1809
aS'[11:31] <Riddell> which might be the best thing to do\n'
p1810
aS'[11:31] <apachelogger> I mean\n'
p1811
aS'[11:31] <apachelogger> we have a system vs user scope problem anyway\n'
p1812
aS'[11:32] <apachelogger> so at the very least there would need to be a button "apply these settigns to the entire system"\n'
p1813
aS'[11:32] <apachelogger> which is not very nice and given the mapping problems from kde to posix that may not work that well either\n'
p1814
aS'[11:33] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: so it seems qt5 built\n'
p1815
aS'[11:33] <apachelogger> but it has no multimedia and no qtwebkit\n'

p2359
aS'[01:40] <akoma1s> ok, a few more questions then:\n'
p2360
aS"[01:40] <akoma1s> 1. which ubuntu version you're using?\n"
p2361
aS'[01:40] <mrafcho001> Kubuntu 13.04 with mainline kernel 3.10\n'
p2362
aS'[01:41] <akoma1s> and 2. have you enabled the xorg-edgers PPA?\n'
p2363
aS"[01:41] <mrafcho001> I don't believe I have\n"
p2364
aS'[01:42] <akoma1s> you could try that as a next step\n'
p2365
aS"[01:42] <akoma1s> if it doesn't solve the problem,\n"
p2366
aS'[01:42] <akoma1s> try Saucy next\n'
p2367
aS"[01:42] <akoma1s> btw, is there some specific reason you're trying the 3.10 kernel?\n"
p2368
aS"[01:43] <mrafcho001> not a very solid reason, but with every iteration my laptop has been working better and better, so I've kept upgrading\n"
p2369
aS'[01:43] <mrafcho001> things like sleep, Fn keys, brightness, started out as not working\n'
p2370
aS'[01:43] <mrafcho001> to working quite well\n'
p2371
aS'[01:43] <mrafcho001> figured 3.10 would have more improvements\n'
p2372
aS'[01:44] <akoma1s> same as for all of us then :)\n'
p2373
aS"[01:45] <akoma1s> well, Intel's drivers are a bit fragile, so the best I could suggest is try, and if it doesn't work, just revert to the previous version\n"
p2374
aS"[01:45] <mrafcho001> i've tried that already actually\n"
p2375
aS"[01:45] <akoma1s> is there anything on your laptop that doesn't work on 3.8/3.9?\n"
p2376
aS'[01:46] <mrafcho001> its fragile, 1/5 boots none of the Fn keys will work, i only reboot my laptop when i upgrade kernel, so its never been much of an issue\n'
p2377
aS"[01:46] <mrafcho001> but i'd like for that to go away\n"
p2378
aS'[01:47] <akoma1s> I see :/\n'
p2379
aS"[01:48] <akoma1s> If you're feeling brave, you could try following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Hotkeys/Troubleshooting , reporting bugs along the way.\n"
p2380
aS"[01:48] <mrafcho001> so whats xorg-edgers ppa? I've heard it mentioned before\n"
p2381
aS'[01:48] <akoma1s> I usually just remap the non-functioning keys to their Win+Alt equivalents, eg. Win+Alt+F8 instead of Fn+F8\n'
p2382
aS'[01:49] <akoma1s> it has the latest graphics stack, for testing purposes\n'
p2383
aS"[01:49] <akoma1s> if you're using the latest kernel, you most definitely want to use it\n"
p2384
aS'[01:49] <mrafcho001> it doesnt seem to be helping\n'

p2388
aS'[01:51] <mrafcho001> akoma1s: thanks for your help\n'
p2389
aS'[01:51] <akoma1s> so, if I understand correctly, the Fn keys work for you in 3.10?\n'
p2390
aS'[01:52] <mrafcho001> seem to work fine, though most of the time they work in 3.9, its on the occasion boot up that they dont work. Its probably a kernel module failing to load for some odd reason. Never had the insentive to look into it\n'
p2391
aS'[01:52] <akoma1s> I see,\n'
p2392
aS"[01:53] <akoma1s> that's definitely a kernel problem problem then, probably some race issue between drivers\n"

p2531
aS'[05:37] <apachelogger> essentially bzr clone lp:kubuntu-debug-installer\n'
p2532
aS'[05:39] <apachelogger> right now it tries to find debug packages using the already active repositories, what we need it to do is allow us to add repositories on-the-fly\n'
p2533
aS'[05:39] <apachelogger> e.g. see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash#Debug_Symbol_Packages\n'
p2534
aS'[05:39] <ScottK> Bonus points for detecting if XMir and declining to file kwin bugs if it is.\n'
p2535
aS'[05:40] <apachelogger> TLDR: most debug packages are autogenerated and put in a separate package repository, so to get access that other repoistory needs to be added to apt\n'
p2536
aS'[05:40] <apachelogger> ^^\n'
p2537
aS'[05:40] <apachelogger> ScottK: I think that is another card TBH\n'
p2538
aS"[05:41] <ScottK> But we can't add it by default because if everyone enabled that repository, it would get crushed.\n"
p2539
aS'[05:41] <apachelogger> ^ that\n'
p2540
aS'[05:42] <apachelogger> so I was thinking ... debug-installer gets started -> tries to find debug packages for files -> fails -> adds the ddebs repository -> updates apt cache -> tries to find debug packages -> failure/success, regardless it removes the repository again -> updates cache\n'
p2541
aS'[05:43] <apachelogger> but I guess you could just play around with it a bit see where the code takes you \n'

p2549
aS"[06:01] <apachelogger> afiestas_: didn't you do a release?\n"
p2550
aS"[06:02] <manchicken> apachelogger: So we're trying to modify the crash handler so that it will install dbgsym packages in the absence of dbg packages?\n"
p2551
aS'[06:02] <apachelogger> yes\n'
p2552
aS'[06:02] <apachelogger> well\n'
p2553
aS'[06:02] <apachelogger> TBH it probably should just always use dbgsym\n'
p2554
aS'[06:03] <manchicken> dbgsym is just the debug symbols for the existing binaries?\n'
p2555
aS'[06:03] <manchicken> Does it replace the binaries with ones using -g flags?\n'
p2556
aS"[06:04] <apachelogger> nope, essentially it's the debug symbols of the binaries\n"
p2557
aS'[06:05] <manchicken> Is that a supplemental file, similar to a dSYM file on OS X?\n'
p2558
aS'[06:05] <ScottK> apachelogger: A new change though is that if a -dbg package exists, the -dbgsym is and empty dependency package that depends on the -dbg.\n'
p2559
aS"[06:05] <manchicken> I've never done debug symbols on GNU/Linux without it being compiled in.\n"
p2560
aS'[06:05] <ScottK> No point in going to the -dbgsym if the -dbg is available.\n'
p2561
aS'[06:06] <apachelogger> so the binaries are built with -g by default and then some packaging tool strips all debug symbols into a shadow binary (i.e. instead of one binary you have two, one with the functional code and one with the debug code). gdb can then put those files back together and allow debugging of a binary that technically has no debug symbols\n'
p2562
aS'[06:06] <apachelogger> manchicken: dsym sounds similar enough\n'
p2563
aS'[06:06] <manchicken> apachelogger: Okay, that makes sense.\n'
p2564
aS'[06:06] <apachelogger> ScottK: actually even more so\n'
p2565
aS"[06:06] <manchicken> But that actualy doesn't matter for this project, right? We're just dealing with package installs.\n"
p2566
aS'[06:06] <apachelogger> if dbgsym is just a dep on dbg it makes even more sense to only go for dbgsym\n'
p2567
aS'[06:07] <ScottK> Maybe.\n'
p2568
aS'[06:07] <ScottK> Yes, just package installs.\n'
p2569
aS'[06:07] <apachelogger> that way you have consistent handling and the package relationship will take care of -dbg packages\n'
p2570
aS'[06:07] <ScottK> OK\n'
p2571
aS'[06:07] <apachelogger> so we install only -dbgsym but indeed -dbg gets in as well\n'
p2572
aS'[06:07] <apachelogger> manchicken: pretty much\n'
p2573
aS'[06:07] <manchicken> Let me look at this existing package. I think step 1 is figuring out what we already have.\n'
p2574
aS'[06:08] <apachelogger> yeah, bzr clone lp:kubuntu-debug-installer\n'
p2575
aS"[06:09] <apachelogger> it's a really simple program ... it gets a list of files that could not be traced (i.e. no debug symbols present) and it uses qapt to find the packages containing those files, then it tries to find the -dbg/-dbgsym package associated\n"
p2576
aS'[06:09] <apachelogger> manchicken: general code refactoring is also very welcome, that was just quickly hacked together and since part refactored once or twice ^^\n'

p2787
aS'[08:29] <manchicken> Yeah, it finds a package for a file, then it tries to guess the debug package.\n'

p2804
aS'[08:33] <manchicken> Oooh, so we need the ability to have this thing add a repo before doing its deed?\n'
p2805
aS'[08:34] <smartboyhw> yofel_, :(\n'
p2806
aS'[08:34] <apachelogger> manchicken: what it does right now is simply take dbgsym into account, but to make use of that the user has to manually add the repo\n'

p2808
aS'[08:34] <manchicken> Wait a minute... Did you just RTFM me?\n'
p2809
aS'[08:35] <apachelogger> manchicken: yeah... simply put echo "repourl" >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/foo && apt-get update && finddbgsympackages && if (found) install && rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/foo && apt-get update\n'
p2810
aS'[08:36] <apachelogger> i.e. add the repo (unless it is present already <- fun part), update cache, do guessing, possibly install stuff, revert changes (drop repo and update cache again)\n'
p2811
aS"[08:40] <manchicken> apachelogger: That doesn't sound all that tricky, actually.\n"
p2812
aS"[08:40] <manchicken> So we don't want to keep the repo in the list even if we install a package?\n"
p2813
aS'[08:40] <manchicken> What about CVEs?\n'
p2814
aS'[08:41] <apachelogger> how do CVEs play into it?\n'
p2815
aS"[08:42] <apachelogger> and I'd imagine that once that is working we may want a checkbox somewhere to allow permanent use of the repo\n"
p2816
aS"[08:42] <apachelogger> the problem is ... the repo pretty much doubles the time apt-get update takes, so it's not something we'd want to introduce if someone files a crahs report once an installation lifetime\n"
p2817
aS"[08:43] <manchicken> What if there's some update to the package, we have debug symbols installed, but now they're out of date.\n"
p2818
aS"[08:43] <apachelogger> OTOH if someone is a tester of pre-release software it's something they'd probably want to keep \n"
p2819
aS'[08:43] <apachelogger> manchicken: the package gets thrown out\n'
p2820
aS'[08:43] <manchicken> Good point.\n'
p2821
aS'[08:43] <apachelogger> (in theory - that requires verification actually)\n'
p2822
aS"[08:44] <manchicken> Well, either it'd get thrown out or the user would hold it in conflict preventing an update, right?\n"
p2823
aS'[08:44] <apachelogger> usually though since the packages are not pulled in by relationships with another package they have a weak dep chain and would get removed to satisfy the upgrade request\n'
p2824
aS'[08:44] <apachelogger> manchicken: yes\n'
p2825
aS'[08:44] <manchicken> Then what you said sounds pretty reasonable.\n'
p2826
aS'[08:45] <manchicken> And then when it\'s done, have some dialog that says "we had to add a repository in order to get the debug symbols, would you like to keep it or trash it?" and then do what they say.\n'
p2827
aS"[08:45] <apachelogger> if it doesn't work we can probably do some apt magic to lower the package score or something\n"
p2828
aS'[08:45] <apachelogger> such that they would get removed regardless\n'
p2829
aS'[08:45] <apachelogger> manchicken: yeah, something like that\n'
p2830
aS'[08:45] <manchicken> Okay, cool.\n'

aS'[11:40] <tester56> hi!, yet another bug I ran into recently in kde 4.11: sometimes the window content of all windows is blanked when applying settings: for example  open task switcher dialog change a setting, cklick apply and all your windows will be blank\n'
p2946
aS'[11:41] <apachelogger> I recommend filing a bug at bugs.kde.org\n'
p2947
aS'[11:47] <shadeslayer> yofel: erk\n'

p2957
aS'[11:49] <smartboyhw> Riddell, you did fix what shadeslayer gave you?\n'
p2958
aS"[11:49] <tester56> is anybody in the mood to test if they can reproduce this ? then I'll file a bug \n"
p2959
aS'[11:49] <Riddell> smartboyhw: I took what you gave me and fixed it\n'
p2960
aS'[11:49] <smartboyhw> Riddell, great:)\n'
p2961
aS"[11:50] <smartboyhw> Oh, yofel's back\n"
p2962
aS"[11:50] <yofel> shadeslayer: right, they'll have to live with pykde 4.9 as far as I see :/\n"
p2963
aS'[11:50] <Riddell> jdrab: much of the firefox integration stuff had to be removed and can now only be found in the blue-shell PPA\n'
p2964
aS'[11:50] <Riddell> tester56: what needs tested?\n'
p2965
aS'[11:50] <smartboyhw> yofel, how did the new .install files go?\n'
p2966

p2970
aS"[11:51] <shadeslayer> yofel: didn't think of this before I started -.-\n"
p2971
aS'[11:52] <shadeslayer> yofel: and 4.9 was enough for KDE 4.10?\n'
p2972
aS'[11:52] <shadeslayer> *pykde4 4.9\n'
p2973
aS'[11:52] <yofel> well, it worked\n'
p2974
aS'[11:52] <tester56> Riddell: If for e.g. changing a setting in Task Switcher and applying produces alle windows going blank / black\n'
p2975
aS'[11:52] <smartboyhw> yofel, why it shows so.2.0.2? -.-\n'
p2976
aS"[11:52] <yofel> shadeslayer: you should've checked what packages were removed before just copying the release package list for the backports\n"

aS'[11:53] <shadeslayer> No KDE 4.11 for Quantal/Precise then\n'
p2985
aS'[11:54] <Riddell> shadeslayer: quantal in staging PPA says /topic\n'
p2986
aS'[11:54] <yofel> pykde you mean\n'
p2987
aS'[11:55] <shadeslayer> yofel: but then alot of things depend on pykde4 4.10?\n'
p2988
aS'[11:55] <shadeslayer> like kate I think\n'
p2989
aS'[11:55] <yofel> they do depend on pykde, but do they need 4.10?\n'

p2993
aS"[11:59] <tester56> i'll try nouveau driver later \n"
p2994
aS"[11:59] <yofel> would need to check, I'm on nvidia-319 too but didn't notice any grave rendering issues\n"
p2995
aS'[11:59] <yofel> (if anything the only one I had was caused by nvidia-310)\n'
p2996
aS'[12:00] <tester56> yofel: have you tried changing and applying a setting in Task Switcher?\n'
p2997
aS"[12:00] <yofel> that's where again?\n"
p2998

aS'[12:06] <shadeslayer> why that sounds like fun\n'
p3010
aS'[12:06] <tester56> and some windows are 100% transluent \n'
p3011
aS"[12:06] <yofel> I got that when changing the display configuration back with nvidia-310, doesn't happen anymore with 319\n"

p3028
aS'[12:11] <tester56> okay i have found the reason: i am using a script that install all my packages on a new install ... i seem to have used an old version this time that install nvidia 304 ... \n'
p3029
aS"[12:11] <yofel> I guess there's enough people that still use it\n"

aS'[12:12] <shrini> is kde uses autopilot for testing?\n'
p3035
aS'[12:13] <shadeslayer> shrini: I started writing some autopilot scripts\n'

aS'[12:14] <Riddell> shrini: want to be added to the !testers call?\n'
p3042
aS'[12:14] <smartboyhw> How long have we NOT used !testers?\n'
p3043
aS"[12:14] <Riddell> I've used it plenty\n"

aS'[12:14] <shrini> Riddell: what is that call?\n'
p3045
aS"[12:14] <Riddell> shrini: a ping to anyone who's offered to help test things\n"
p3046

p3063
aS'[12:15] <shrini> is it manual test or need autopilot script?\n'
p3064
aS'[12:16] <shadeslayer> because the Kubuntu plasma init script sets it to alt + f1\n'

aS"[14:06] <ivaldi> hi - i would like to map a bug to a project with launchpadlib - is there a nice way to do this? (my current solution is something like this: bug.bug_tasks.entries[0]['bug_target_name'] - but i'm not sure if this is always work or is the right way to do this)\n"
