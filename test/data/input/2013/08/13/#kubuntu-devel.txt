[05:16] <jussi> morning all
[05:19] <jussi> can someone help me with graphics at all? I need the Kubuntu logo to be White letters, not black... (for embroidery on Navy blue).
[05:38] <Tm_T> jussi: the whole logo?
[05:38] <jussi> Tm_T: yes
[05:38] <Tm_T> jussi: where's the source you're using?
[05:38] <jussi> Tm_T: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/KubuntuArtwork
[05:39] <Tm_T> ha, was on that page already, thanks
[05:39] <jussi> :)
[05:39] <Tm_T> jussi: what format you need?
[05:40] <jussi> Tm_T: a decently large PNG should be fine
[05:40] <Tm_T> jussi: does the gears need to be reversed in colours too?
[05:40] <jussi> Tm_T: no
[05:40] <jussi> just the back letters white
[05:40] <Tm_T> so only the text, one moment I'll save this
[05:41] <jussi> Tm_T: see this: http://jontheechidna.wordpress.com/2012/12/23/kubuntu-shirt-flu/
[05:42] <Tm_T> ah, yes
[05:45] <Tm_T> jussi: http://www.tm-travolta.net/shots/kubuntu-logo-lucid-1.png
[05:45] <Tm_T> transparent background, white text
[05:46] <jussi> Tm_T: thank you sir!
[05:47] <Tm_T> jussi: I simply opened svg on karbon, clicked the text, picked white colour, exported png
[05:48] <jussi> Tm_T: hehe... that would require me to even know that it was karbon needed to open svgs... :D
[05:48] <Tm_T> jussi: oh no, I simply opened the file and it was opened in karbon, first time for me to use karbon at all
[05:48] <jussi> ahh ok
[05:49] <jussi> Guess my lack of kofffeeeeeeeeeee is showing me up
[05:49] <Tm_T> this is how technology should work, you don't have to pick tools, they're just there for you (:
[05:49] <jussi> yup
[05:50] <Tm_T> hmmmm, I wonder...
[05:50] <Tm_T> I'll try do the same edit with vim just for the giggles
[06:00] <Tm_T> let's make it red
[06:00] <jussi> hehe
[06:12] <soee> good morning
[06:13] <jussi> morning soee? 
[06:13] <jussi> err, without the ? 
[06:13] <jussi> :P
[06:13] <soee> yes morning jussi :D
[06:14] <soee> its 8:15 -.-
[06:14] <jussi> mornings...
[06:17] <soee> :)
[06:44] <baltolkien> Goog Morning
[07:28] <jussi> Riddell: one final detail: What sizes did you order? Im thinking to go S:5, M:5, L:10, XL:5. 
[07:35] <Tm_T> jussi: all male shirts at this point?
[07:36] <jussi> Tm_T: yeah, its too small a number for female ones, unfortunately. Its not I didnt think of it, but its not going to work for this order
[07:37] <Tm_T> I agree, unfortunately
[07:37] <Tm_T> jussi: let me know when female cuts are available
[07:37] <Tm_T> preferably both small and large sizes
[07:38] <jussi> Tm_T: when/if these sell out, I expect female will be next on the agenda. This is really about testing the waters
[07:38] <Tm_T> yup
[07:38] <jussi> Making sure the systems work etc
[08:19] <shadeslayer> ScottK: kinda, I'm more actively looking at things to do in Frameworks to do for sure
[09:09] <tester56> hi i have downloaded kde-style-oxygen and all it's dependencies, copied oxygen.so to /usr/lib32/kde4/plugins/styles and determined all needed libaries with "ldd". It finds all libaries now (copied to /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu)
[09:09] <tester56> I am on a 64 bit system and want to use 32 bit qt apps like skpye with oxygen style 
[09:10] <tester56> switching to gtk as layout is not an option for me (it would use oxygen-gtk then)
[09:11] <tester56> so i started skype using "QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib32/kde4/plugins/styles/ skype" but i can't select oxygen
[09:11] <tester56> has anybody an idea what does not work?
[09:12] <tester56> i have heared this working from many sources, http://community.skype.com/t5/Linux/Enabling-oxygen-style-in-Skype-on-64-bit-systems-is-WAY-TOO-HARD/td-p/1695840 is one of them
[09:13] <tester56> i downloaded the packages from repo using sudo aptitude -o APT::Architecture="i386" download 
[09:15] <shadeslayer> how odd
[09:15] <shadeslayer> yofel: I haven't signed your keys?
[09:16] <yofel> hm, no, at least here it doesn't say so
[09:18] <tester56> i have solved it :-))))
[09:19] <tester56> in ~/.config/Trolltech.conf wa an entry "[Qt%20Plugin%20Cache%204.8.false]"
[09:19] <tester56> i have removed it and restarted skype ... everything looks fine 
=== Oli`` is now known as Oli
[09:20] <tester56> it would be nice if there was a package to install oxygen 32 on 64 bit
[09:23] <tester56> are there any plans to package something like this?
[09:26] <tester56> i have wps office running which is also a qt 32 bit application ... but it does not use oxygen ... it works for skype though now 
[09:27] <tester56> is there any way to establish the reason why it does not work?
[09:27] <tester56> on a 32 bit system theming works fine
[09:33] <tester56> which oxygen libary is responsible for the color scheme?
[10:09] <smartboyhw> Hey Kubuntu people
[10:09]  * smartboyhw blames yofel and shadeslayer and Riddell of not replying to the e-mail
[10:26] <yofel> I'll try to do that later today
[10:26] <yofel> smartboyhw: want to update nepomuk and marble in the meantime?
[10:27] <smartboyhw> yofel, uh, I can do it 1-2 hours later
[10:30] <yofel> sure
[10:33] <smartboyhw> yofel, to confirm: I'm supposed to use the 4.11.0a versions for nepomuk and marble?
[10:33] <vHanda> *nepomuk-core
[10:34] <smartboyhw> Yeah
=== who_da_fly is now known as superfly
[10:50] <yofel> smartboyhw: yes
[10:50] <smartboyhw> yofel, sure
=== dpm_ is now known as dpm
[11:13] <Riddell> ScottK: ah hah, well it doesn't much cover me but I would like to look at getting them co-installable
[11:20]  * shadeslayer was doing paperwork all day today
[11:20] <shadeslayer> I can only reply tomorrow I think
[11:21] <shadeslayer> or maybe on the 15th since I have a holiday on that day
[11:42] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, OK;)
[12:00] <smartboyhw> yofel, uploading nepomuk-core
[12:09] <Riddell> hmm, lots of blue http://qa.kubuntu.co.uk/ninjas-status/build_status_4.11.0_raring.html
[12:22] <yofel> kde4libs had failed without reason, I restarted it earlier
[12:44] <jussi> have we all seen the youtube easter egg? (probably old, but I just found it) if you havent, go to a video, pause it and type 1980 :D
[12:45] <smartboyhw> yofel, marble uploading
[12:47] <yofel> thanks!
[12:48] <yofel> could you update raring too while at it? Should be as simple as running the default hook and adding the changelog entry
[12:48] <smartboyhw> yofel, default hook = ？
[12:49] <yofel> backport-hooks/stable/raring
[12:49] <smartboyhw> yofel, either I'm stupid or I just can't see a raring hook
[12:49] <yofel> checkout too old?
[12:50] <smartboyhw> yofel, probably:(
[12:50] <smartboyhw> Unfortunately, I am doing this alongside a full -j4 kernel build, so it will take some time:p
[12:53] <yofel> well, there's no hurry
[12:54] <shadeslayer> jussi: nothing happpens
[12:54] <shadeslayer> jussi: seeks back to the beginning
[12:54] <jussi> shadeslayer: you failed then. 1980
[12:55] <smartboyhw> yofel, where is the 13.04 PPA? kubuntu-ppa/staging?
[12:55] <jussi> shadeslayer: open http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYXz1hE_bWc and try it, perhaps ad supported doesnt work or something
[12:56] <yofel> no, ninjas now, see pad
[12:56] <yofel> which reminds me that I should purge the 13.04 stuff from staging

[12:57] <Riddell> time to move on from 4.10.97
[12:58] <shadeslayer> haha
[12:58] <shadeslayer> jussi: I think it only works with flash vids
[12:58] <jussi> shadeslayer: yeah, I dunno, but its a good one
[13:02] <jussi> shadeslayer: seems like the focus cant be on the video element then it works
[13:07] <smartboyhw> yofel, I've done nepomuk-core to raring
[13:07] <tester56> hi again: How to make Trolltech.conf use 32 bit oxygen for 32 bit apps and 64 bit oxygen for 64 bit apps?
[13:07] <tester56> I can delete .config/Trolltech.conf
[13:08] <tester56> when I start a 32 bit app then 32 bit apps use oxygen but not 64 bit and vice versa
[13:11] <tester56> exporting QT_PLUGIN_PATH for the app has no impact
[13:12] <Riddell> yofel: shall I use the backport script to upload 4.11 into ninjas or is there more stuff needing done for the LTS bits there?
[13:13] <yofel> the backport script should work fine for precise
[13:13] <yofel> I think I reverted all of the mesa changes I had in there
[13:14] <yofel> for that matter, I installed precise on a SD card over the weekend and ran 4.10.97 on my intel notebook here. Worked fine.
[13:14] <Riddell> tester56: I don't think I understand your issue
[13:14] <Riddell> tester56: you're using kde plasma or another desktop?
[13:14] <tester56> i have manually install all 32 bit libaries needed for oxygen.so
[13:14] <yofel> So considering the amount of people that actually use it I think we can live with the occasional mesa 8 issue, and recommend the HWE stack in those cases
[13:15] <tester56> Riddell: kde plasma
[13:15] <yofel> need to send martin a mail though as that's not what we agreed on
[13:15] <tester56> Riddell: problem is 32 bit apps like skype can't use oxygen 
[13:16] <Riddell> yofel: so no HW enablement backports by default?
[13:16] <yofel> no, at least not as upgrade
[13:16] <tester56> Riddell: So I have downloaded kde-style-oxygen and copied oxygen.so to /usr/lib32/kde4/plugins/styles
[13:17] <tester56> Riddell: (32 bit version)
[13:17] <smartboyhw> yofel, can you fix marble in 13.10?
[13:17]  * smartboyhw does not have time, sorry
[13:17] <tester56> Riddell: then I determined all required libaries using ldd
[13:18] <tester56> now Trolltech.conf only lets me set either 32 bit oxygen or 64 bit oxygen
[13:19] <yofel> I don't see how oxygen here is fixable without multiarch-ing kde-style-oxygen. Which doesn't sound trivial at all
[13:20] <tester56> is multiarch planned for the future?
[13:20] <smartboyhw> tester56, probably...
[13:20] <yofel> not the near future
[13:21] <tester56> the stuff i did should work: http://chakra-project.org/bbs/viewtopic.php?pid=61765
[13:21] <yofel> the path should be /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/kde4/plugins/styles btw. for us, we have no lib32
[13:22] <shadeslayer> whats up
[13:22] <yofel> smartboyhw: no time to fix marble either, sorry
[13:22] <shadeslayer> wasn't marble respun
[13:22] <shadeslayer> same for nepomuk-core
[13:23] <shadeslayer> were they re-uploaded?
[13:23] <yofel> they were
[13:23] <shadeslayer> awesome
[13:23] <yofel> now marble complains about
[13:23] <yofel> dh_install: libmarblewidget16 missing files (usr/lib/libmarblewidget.so.0.15.*), aborting
[13:23] <yofel> weird
[13:23] <shadeslayer> what needs doing raring?
[13:23] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, marble
[13:23] <yofel> fix saucy first
[13:23] <yofel> kopete failed too
[13:23] <shadeslayer> looking at kopete
[13:24] <shadeslayer> can someone QA ktp from my PPA?
[13:24] <shadeslayer> for raring
[13:25] <shadeslayer> and kscreen
[13:25] <shadeslayer> stuff to QA just keeps piling up :<
[13:25] <tester56> yofel: that path does not work either
[13:26] <yofel> well, the default qt plugin path does not respect multiarch folders so I'm not surprised
[13:26] <tester56> yofel: I can have oxygen, but only either for 32 bit or 64 bit (at least with autogenerated Trolltech.conf)
[13:27] <tester56> I don't know what I should edit 
[13:27] <shadeslayer> ufff
[13:27]  * yofel wonders how qt5 handles that
[13:27] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: next time plz mention the KDE bug instead of a direct patch to the link plz
[13:27] <tester56> both paths (32 bit one and 64 bit one show up in the config file)
[13:27] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, what?
[13:27] <shadeslayer>   [ Howard Chan ]
[13:27] <shadeslayer>  * Introduce patch at http://bugsfiles.kde.org/attachment.cgi?id=80534
[13:27] <shadeslayer>     to fix audio_stream
[13:27] <shadeslayer> in kopete
[13:28] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, my fault, sorry;p
[13:28] <yofel> another complain: the patch name is missing
[13:28] <shadeslayer> do you remember the the bug number?
[13:28] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, /me searches
[13:28] <smartboyhw> yofel, no name from upstream, it's an attachment of the bug
[13:28] <yofel> smartboyhw: I mean the file name in debian/patches/
[13:29] <smartboyhw> yofel, oh, sorry
[13:29] <yofel> otherwise I have almost no way to find out *when* a patch was added
[13:29] <shadeslayer> plus would be nice to have dep 3 formatted patches
[13:29] <shadeslayer> but that's a dream for now
[13:30] <yofel> dep3 is strongly recommended for non-git-format-patch patches really
[13:30] <shadeslayer> *nod*
[13:30] <smartboyhw> Uh, obviously I forgotten that, I do include these normally:(
[13:31] <shadeslayer> fwiw I think smartboyhw's patch causes the failiure
[13:31] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, Bug 318825

[13:31] <smartboyhw> I think so, I forgotten..................
[13:31] <smartboyhw> That's what upstream directed me to...
[13:31] <shadeslayer> it most certainly touches the exact same code that fails to compile
[13:32] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, eh, I asked in #kopete and they pointed me to there:(
[13:33]  * smartboyhw blames upsteram.
[13:34]  * yofel blames smartboyhw for not noticing that it failed to build
[13:34]  * smartboyhw did not see the failure e-mails, sorry
[13:36]  * shadeslayer points to policy
[13:36] <yofel> I tried to build kopete against ortp-0.21.1 and mediastreamer-2.9.0 which are part of linphone 3.6 beta1.
[13:36] <yofel> from the bug
[13:36] <yofel> we have 3.5.2-10
[13:36] <yofel> so the patch doesn't apply for us
[13:37] <smartboyhw> yofel, :O but I asked in #kopete and they told me that. I should copy down the logs..
[13:38] <smartboyhw> http://paste.ubuntu.com/5981197/
[13:39] <smartboyhw> (Next time I should NOT  be fooled:(...)
[13:41] <yofel> smartboyhw: ok, I know what happened
[13:41] <yofel> we indeed had the newer linphone, but Scott removed that from the archive because of debian bug 716855
[13:41] <ubottu> Debian bug 716855 in libucommon-dev "libucomon-dev: Dependency on libgnutls28-dev makes sflphone unbuildable" [Important,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/716855
[13:42] <yofel> that patch should really have an #ifdef with the version
[13:43] <shadeslayer> note that the patch is on bugzilla, it's just meant to be a stop gap measure and is not a 'real' patch :P
[13:45] <yofel> true
[13:46] <shadeslayer> smartboyhw: something for the future, don't drop patches from bugzilla
[13:46] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, OK
[13:47] <shadeslayer> yofel: did you make use of the wifi dongle ? :P
[13:48] <shadeslayer> removing smartboyhw's patch makes it compile :)
[13:48] <yofel> not yet, I want to use it for the raspi, but I never actually get to move that
[13:48] <shadeslayer> heh, my raspi is currently in it's box
[13:48] <shadeslayer> might set it up once I move to the office
[13:49] <yofel> mine is running... doing nothing
[13:49] <shadeslayer> hehe
[13:49] <shadeslayer> I might use it to self host mykolab

[13:51] <yofel> what's that red hat doing there? :P
[13:52] <shadeslayer> that's what you noticed? I sort of noticed the gtk equivalent of kscreen :P
[13:52] <shadeslayer> *sort of first
[13:53] <yofel> i was wondering what that was, thanks for clearing that up (looked vaguely familiar ^^)
[13:55] <shadeslayer> well ... it *looks* like the gtk equivalent of kscreen, I'm not sure myself ;)
[13:55] <shadeslayer> kopete fixed in ppa/bzr
[13:55] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, yofel (et. al): Deeply sorry for wasting your time:(
[13:56] <yofel> uh, didn't we just figure out that it's not your fault?
[13:56] <yofel> well, you could've known what caused it though
[13:56] <smartboyhw> yofel, yeah, that's why I have to apologise:(
[13:56] <yofel> in any case, nvm
[13:57] <smartboyhw> DAMN

[14:02] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, XChat
[14:03] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: I'm asking about input method selector
[14:03] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, IBus？
[14:03] <smartboyhw> Why?
[14:03] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: Is that a question or answer?
[14:03] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, IBus is the answer, why is the question:P
[14:04] <Quintasan> Oh, I wanted someone competent (as in "I actually know what the hell I'm typing") to test fcitx with Chinese
[14:04] <Quintasan> While typing at random is generally a good test case for "Does it work" it's not good for anything else.
[14:05]  * smartboyhw likes IBus, sorry:P
[14:07] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: Can you just give it a go?
[14:08] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, no time sorry
[14:08] <Quintasan> Okay.
[14:17] <shadeslayer> 4.11 should be all fixed up
[14:18] <shadeslayer> be back later
[14:30] <Quintasan> smartboyhw: Do you happen to know any Chinese Kubuntu users who could try fcitix for a while?
[14:31] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, NO.
[14:31] <Quintasan> Ah well.
[14:31] <smartboyhw> Quintasan, Chinese users will rather use UbuntuKylin now...
[14:42] <shadeslayer> you can't say that definitely
[14:42] <shadeslayer> what if the chinese secret agency is using Kubuntu everywhere
[14:42] <shadeslayer> Quintasan doesn't want to piss them off
[14:48] <Quintasan> lol
[14:49] <Quintasan> toplel theory :D
[14:54] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, you know that UbuntuKylin is actually developed by the governernment itself!?Q
[14:55] <shadeslayer> so ... UbuntuKylin spies on it's users, and if it's users are the secret service, the spy agency spies on itself? recursive spying? :D
[14:56] <smartboyhw> shadeslayer, can't it?
[14:56] <shadeslayer> I wouldn't know the first thing about spying
[14:58] <yofel> spying on yourself is called making backups
[14:58] <smartboyhw> yofel, +1
[16:36] <Riddell> yofel: what's your current practice for symbols files on backports?
[16:37] <Riddell> I've always just deleted the symbols files on backports if they cause problems
[16:52] <Riddell> although it doesn't fail to build I'm getting confused by it being red on build_status page
[17:12] <yofel> Riddell: same here, the precise hook even does that. Should be added to the others too IMO
[17:37] <Riddell> cor, blue http://qa.kubuntu.co.uk/ninjas-status/build_status_4.11.0_precise.html
[18:55] <jussi> Riddell: you are awesome :D
[19:02]  * Riddell sits back in satisfaction of being awesome
[19:02] <Riddell> jussi: wait, what am I awesome for just now?
[19:34] <Riddell> sweet, setting up a network printer is just as easy as a local one
[19:34] <Riddell> trouble is easy doesn't include it pre-selecting the driver
[20:37] <Riddell> looks like sources are available http://download.kde.org/stable/4.11.0/src/
[20:38] <Riddell> any objections to uploading 4.11 tonight to saucy?
[20:38] <soee> nope :)
[20:39] <Riddell> raring needs a few more bits compiling then probably mable/nepomuk updated then testing
[20:39] <soee> also request for raring -.-
[20:39] <Riddell> precise needs lots more bits compiling
[20:39] <Riddell> soee: i386 is done if you want to test htat
