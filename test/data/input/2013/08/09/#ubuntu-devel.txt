[06:20] <noaXess> hello
[06:20] <noaXess> am i at the correct place to ask about package upgade/install problems? it's about mysql-server, maysql-server-5.5 http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965187/
[06:28] <noaXess> more information after purging mysql-server-5.5 and remove /etc/mysql and /var/lib/mysql and reinstall mysql-server: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965242/
[06:32] <sarnold> noaXess: can you run dmesg | grep user.frm   ? I'm curious if the AppArmor policy needs to be extended (errno 13 is "Permission denied")
[06:49] <noaXess> sarnold: sure.. wait
[06:49] <noaXess> sarnold: no output
[06:49] <dholbach> good morning
[06:49] <noaXess> dholbach: morning
[06:49] <dholbach> hi noaXess
[06:50] <noaXess> is it a package problem?
[06:50] <sarnold> noaXess: well, that's probably for the best for everyone else :) but it does mean I'm not sure what step to take next. maybe try to find that user.frm file and check permissions on it?
[06:54] <noaXess> sarnold: have you installed mysql-server?
[06:54] <noaXess> here are perms to root:root sudo ls -l /var/lib/mysql/mysql which i think it should be on mysql:mysql
[06:54] <noaXess> does the package upgrade/install make wrong perms?
[07:06] <noaXess> strange: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965336/

[07:35] <geser> noaXess: see bug 1210380, this seems to be an update regression in -proposed
[07:35] <ubottu> bug 1210380 in mysql-5.5 (Ubuntu) "package mysql-server-5.5 5.5.32-0ubuntu0.12.04.2 failed to install/upgrade: subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1210380
[07:37] <noaXess> geser: that means? workaround or wait? can't wait.. i'm developing each day on mysql..
[07:39] <geser> the workaround for now seems to be to downgrade to 5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 from -updates/-security
[07:40] <noaXess> geser: so install an older version..
[07:40] <noaXess> ok.. hm.. purge first all, recover data
[07:42] <noaXess> geser: how do i downgrade to that package versino? do i need first purge all mysql-* packages?
[07:46] <sladen> geser: apt-get install abcdef=1.2.3.4ubuntu1  http://askubuntu.com/questions/138284/how-to-downgrade-a-package-via-apt-get
[07:51] <geser> sladen: I guess that was meant for noaXess
[07:52] <noaXess> sladen: yeah.. but that shows dep errors.. so i think i need this: sudo apt-get -s install mysql-server=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-server-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-server-core-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-common=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-client=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-client-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 mysql-client-core-5.5=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1 libdbd-mysql-perl libmysqlclient18=5.5.32-0ubuntu0.13.04.1
[07:55] <geser> yes you need to downgrade all mysql 5.5 packages together
[07:59] <noaXess> can't get it running.. same error then before.. also if i use verinos 5.5.29-0ubuntu1
[07:59] <noaXess> always on setting up mysql-server-5.5: http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965500/
[08:02] <noaXess> :'(
[08:03] <noaXess> what happens if i purge all mysql-* packages? will it break system?
[08:03] <noaXess> cause purge mysql-common will purge also http://paste.ubuntu.com/5965518/
[09:08] <seb128> cjwatson, hey, do you still plan to add the icon info the click manifest soon? (I'm waiting on that to make system settings use the manifest instead of the fake datas)
[09:18] <cjwatson> seb128: It's on my list for this month - will try to get it done over DebConf

[11:14] <rbasak> stokachu, doko_: mysql-5.5 5.5.32-0ubuntu2 is stuck in saucy-proposed. Is this related to verification-failed in bug 1121874?

[11:18] <xnox> rbasak: mysql-5.5 autopkgtest fail http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-archive/proposed-migration/update_excuses.html but it looks like it never passed, thus each time it was probably "adt ignored" manually by release team.
[11:18] <rbasak> Ah I see. I did get confused by that.
[11:18] <xnox> rbasak: thus it's waiting for an override.
[11:19] <rbasak> We'll need to fix 5.5.32-0ubuntu2 anyway, as I presume it's broken the same way as the others.

[12:20] <rbasak> jamespage: what do you think about changing pull-lp-source to pull from -proposed instead?
[12:21] <rbasak> AIUI, the point is to get the latest version, so perhaps it should.
[12:21] <rbasak> (it'd have to fall back though I guess)
[12:21] <jamespage> rbasak, might be a good idea actually - would stop some of the confusion I have seen
[12:45] <xnox> cjwatson: so some of the new build-deps for automake's testsuite are in universe. I've dropped those build-deps, and instead added autopkgtest to run the fuller testsuite.
[12:46] <xnox> rbasak: pull-lp-source already pulls from -proposed. there are timing issues, but you can do $ pull-lp-source package saucy-proposed
[12:46] <xnox> rbasak: or specify version explicitely, if you notice it pull out of date.
[12:47] <xnox> rbasak: similarly one can use: $dist-updates $dist-proposed $dist-security
[13:49] <cyphermox> infinity: hey
[14:19] <jdstrand> tedg: hey-- so I approved the click MIR yesterday. it is my understanding you were blocked on that. it is still in universe-- is there something you need me to do to unblock you?
[14:19] <jdstrand> tedg: I should also point out that click-apparmor doesn't have a MIR yet, but I plan to create on today. are you blocked on that too?
[14:20] <tedg> jdstrand, Yeah, I noticed I was talking with fginther on how to move that forward.  My understanding is that I need to dep on it to get it pulled in.
[14:20] <tedg> jdstrand, No, I just need the click-dev dependency to be allowed.
[14:20] <tedg> jdstrand, Obviously that'll make things not work, but they'll build, etc.
[14:20] <stgraber> tedg: yeah, you need to dep on it or have it seeded then it'll show up in component-mismatches and an archive admin will override it to main
[14:20] <tedg> jdstrand, Thanks for getting to that!
[14:20] <jdstrand> tedg: ok. I could seed it, but that seems like a a weird seed for desktop since
[14:21] <tedg> stgraber, Yeah, the issue is how to convince Jenkins it is okay.  It errors on deps that aren't in main.
[14:21] <jdstrand> tedg: but if it would help you, let me know
[14:21] <tedg> (which is reasonable, but need to figure out this case)
[14:21] <ogra_> jdstrand, put it in supported
[14:21] <jdstrand> ogra_: yeah, that would work
[14:21] <jdstrand> tedg: shall I just do that ^
[14:21] <ogra_> though i'm not sure that actually pulls it in, hmm
[14:21] <jdstrand> I think it does
[14:21] <tedg> I don't know what that is.  But if you think it would work, I'm happy with it :-)
[14:22] <ogra_> trying wont hurt i guess
[14:22] <ogra_> sadly ubuntu-touch seeds still live in universe
[14:22] <jdstrand> tedg: I'll do the override
[14:22] <ogra_> else you could just seed it there
[14:22] <jdstrand> it should be seeded on the touch images
[14:22] <ogra_> right
[14:23] <ogra_> but they build from universe atm
[14:23] <jdstrand> oh I see what you mean
[14:23] <ogra_> until all PPAs are gone from the build
[14:56] <jdstrand> tedg: ok, added click and click-dev to the supported seed and adjusted the overrides. let me know if you need any more help
[14:59] <tedg> jdstrand, Cool, thanks!
[14:59]  * jdstrand will keep an eye on component mismatches
[15:16] <infinity> cyphermox: 'sup?
[15:17] <cyphermox> infinity: ah, I wanted to ask about colord blocking systemd. I noticed you unblocked the test failure for chromium-browser, and the colord failure seems unrelated to systemd, just the same usual reason it fails
[15:17] <cyphermox> ^ re: transition from proposed to release
[15:24] <infinity> cyphermox: Had nothing to do with systemd, I foced skipping tests on colord/1.0.1-1ubuntu2
[15:24] <infinity> cyphermox: The hope was that the next version would fix the broken tests, not that I'd have to keep hinting forever. :P
[15:25] <cyphermox> right. the next version of colord.
[15:26] <infinity> cyphermox: Yes, but clearly that didn't happen.  Can someone fix the test? :P
[15:26] <infinity> RAOF: I'm looking at you.
[15:26] <cyphermox> infinity: I don't know, perhaps someone could. ;)
[15:28] <infinity> cyphermox: Anyhow, yes, it looks like the same failure as last version, so I'll bump the hint for now. :/

[22:34] <crankharder> sorry if offtopic.. looking for an upstart config that can manage a process that is expected to have its PPID change.  not fork, not daemonize... it'll actually spawn a replacement process.
[22:38] <infinity> crankharder: That would be different from forking how?
[22:38] <xnox> crankharder: can you strace that process? using establishing pid count recipe from upstart cookbook
[22:39] <sarnold> crankharder: so, say, over a few weeks, it'll cycle pids through the entire pid space?
[22:39] <crankharder> infinity: it forks itself and then kills the original... but that's expected, and i dont want upstart to start a new process
[22:39] <infinity> crankharder: That's the definition of daemonizing.
[22:39] <crankharder> except this happens repeatedly when it receives USR2
[22:39] <infinity> Oh.
[22:39] <infinity> Ew. :)
[22:39] <crankharder> :)
[22:40] <infinity> I'm not convinced any sane process tracking system is prepared to deal with that scenario.
[22:41] <infinity> How did one do it in the sysvinit world?  Does it keep updating a pidfile with its current mystery PID?
[22:41] <crankharder> it maintains its own PID file
[22:41] <infinity> Hah.  Jinx.
[22:41] <crankharder> haven't seen a config for upstart to specify a pid file though
[22:41] <sarnold> it almost seems like a task designed solely to run from systemd.
[22:42] <infinity> sarnold: Or sysvinit, to be fair.
[22:42] <crankharder> ya'll lost me there ;)
[22:42] <sarnold> infinity: the pid file does help sysvinit a lot, yes..
[22:43] <infinity> crankharder: Anyhow, I'd say the answer right now is "upstart can't do that", and you want a legacy sysvinit script in /etc/init.d instead of an upstart job.
[22:43] <crankharder> yea, i have one of those, but sysvinit won't restart it if it dies completely
[22:43] <crankharder> upstart in theory could do that
[22:44] <infinity> Sure.  If upstart could even remotely sort out how to track it.
[22:44] <crankharder> I was thinking of a wrapper bash script that would just loop and check the pid file and die if the pid in the pid didn't exist
[22:44] <infinity> We've discussed allowing "expect fork" to take an argument to specify number of forks, but "expect fork infinite" would never seem like a good idea.
[22:44] <crankharder> hah
[22:45] <crankharder> so, nginx works this way - kinda a big one, so hopefully someone else is thinking about this
[22:45] <crankharder> i'm not trying to solve for that though
[22:45] <infinity> nginx doesn't have a control process like... Everyone else who uses this sort of worker model?
[22:45] <infinity> (apache, spamassassin, etc)
[22:46] <crankharder> i dunno, you tell me
[22:46] <crankharder> https://gist.github.com/crankharder/93a68a060329d8446ede
[22:46]  * TheLordOfTime heard nginx mentioned
[22:46] <crankharder> ...and that's supposed to be a transparent restart
[22:46] <infinity> Looks like a master process there to me.
[22:46] <crankharder> yea, but the pid changed?
[22:46] <infinity> Yes, because it was restarted...
[22:47] <TheLordOfTime> what infinity said, when nginx restarts the master process PID changed
[22:47] <crankharder> okay, fair, nvm
[22:55] <infinity> crankharder: You could file a wishlist bug for this sort of bizarre tracking.  Something like "expect pidfile /var/run/daemon.pid" could put an inotify watch on the pidfile and force it to update its ptrace when the pidfile changes.
[22:56] <infinity> crankharder: Seems like it would be a bit fragile to get right, but theoretically doable.
[22:57] <infinity> (Or rewrite the daemon in question to have a control process :P)
[22:58] <crankharder> think i'm gonna try to hacktogether some bashfu control process and have upstart monitor that... and see where that gets me
