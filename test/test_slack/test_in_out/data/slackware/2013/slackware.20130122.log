[00:08:20] <wood_quinn> shonudo: Hmm?
[00:09:02] <Urchlay> political BS. I almost got fired from a coding job when a high-dollar customer (who had my direct number, only 1 of 3 clients that did) gave me a bug report and I followed the steps they did and went "Yep, you're right, you found a bug, lemme look at the code and call you back with an ETA on the fix"
[00:09:17] <Urchlay> boss was livid: "You *NEVER* admit there's a bug in the code!"

[00:10:25] <ananke> that's absurd. i can't think of any major company that would behave that way
[00:10:28] <Urchlay> right. especially when they're the ones who found/reported the bug. I'd not only have to lie, I'd have to imply that the customer was lying or incompetent
[00:10:45] <wood_quinn> ^ Major companies do that however.
[00:10:48] <n1x4> Microsoft does it with eveery release

[00:11:11] <ananke> n1x4: bullshit. they admit to bugs all the time
[00:11:21] <n1x4> Not at the release ;)
[00:11:21] <Urchlay> ananke: this wasn't a major company. I'm not really major company material (I can't work somewhere with more than about 10-15 employees, total, I lack the social/interpersonal skills to keep track of more)
[00:12:03] <ananke> n1x4: depends on what you mean by 'at the release'. we're talking about admitting to a bug that was identified

[00:12:23] <n1x4> then you got me there.
[00:12:35] <Urchlay> they release patches, with release notes that explain what they're for (which describe what bugs are being fixed)

[00:13:33] <n1x4> But they (and other devs) know that there are bugs in the code but just want to relese it as fast as possible so they will knowingly ship it for sale with bugs THEN release updates/patches.
[00:13:49] <wood_quinn> Lol reminds me of Vista.
[00:13:56] <n1x4> OH GAWD!
[00:14:07] <wood_quinn> It was running late, but corporate customers would get it on time if they paid early :)
[00:14:10] <wood_quinn> Figure that one out.
[00:14:24] <Urchlay> well, probably the actual developers aren't responsible for that. Marketing says "It has to ship by $deadline" and the devs do what they can
[00:14:30] <KaMii> Urchlay: im with you, thats stupid, the guy found a bug and reported it... why would he be mad if you agreed?  i thought the customer was always right?
[00:14:43] <n1x4> Urchlay: That's ppossible
[00:14:44] <ananke> n1x4: there is no bug free software out there. it's a matter of identifying which bugs are major, and need to be squashed before release
[00:15:07] <ananke> n1x4: if you'd look at any major linux distribution, same thing happens there
[00:15:21] <Urchlay> KaMii: the customer was damn happy: I called him back an hour later with "OK, the code is fixed, I'm testing the fix now, and it should be deployed by tomorrow morning"
[00:15:24] <ananke> you identify milestones, you reach them, and minor bugs are carried over
[00:15:45] <Urchlay> (web based software, they didn't have to do anything on their end)
[00:15:50] <n1x4> Agreed, 100%. All I'm saying is that some/most companies will release the main pkg KNOWING that there are bugs in it and not try to resolve them before-hand
[00:16:04] <Urchlay> n1x4: game companies might be the worst offenders there
[00:16:07] <KaMii> Urchlay: so why was the boss upset?
[00:16:17] <n1x4> Oh hell yes... Skyrim for example
[00:16:18] <wood_quinn> Because it "made the company look bad"
[00:16:22] <n1x4> What a mess that was
[00:16:23] <Urchlay> yeah
[00:16:31] <wood_quinn> But the alternative is telling the customer "Clear your cookies"
[00:16:33] <ananke> n1x4: microsoft is a bad example here. they have abandoned tons of technologies due to bugs or because they were not ready to ship. they've moved up deadlines for releases
[00:16:37] <wood_quinn> Which makes the company look incompetent.
[00:16:53] <ananke> saying that microsoft always ships buggy stuff knowingly is just extra FUD
[00:16:56] <Urchlay> I broke the rule "never admit there's a bug in the code"... which wasn't actually a rule (not in the employee handbook, had never been said to me before...)
[00:17:12] <KaMii> awww doest seem they did dantes peak in rifftrax
[00:17:17] <Urchlay> if I'd known there was a rule against it, I would have broken it anyway though
[00:17:32] <wood_quinn> Yeah not sure how else you're supposed to handle the situation.
[00:17:32] <KaMii> Urchlay: thats the dumbest rule
[00:17:45] <KaMii> just like that rule, dont dance on the tables in the coffee shop....
[00:17:51] <wood_quinn> Fix it without telling them and say you don't see the problem and they should try again?
[00:17:54] <Urchlay> I did, early on, try to explain to the boss that I was the worst possible person for clients to talk to
[00:18:02] <JarJar> Urchlay, with what program languages do you work ? :)
[00:18:11] <Urchlay> because I don't have it in me to lie or sugarcoat things

[00:18:36] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea, i couldnt lie to customers either
[00:18:39] <Urchlay> (I always hated java, I wasn't the one who picked it...)
[00:18:51] <JarJar> so now what do you do ? :)
[00:18:56] Action: KaMii drinks java
[00:19:02] <JarJar> still oo or c ?
[00:19:13] <Urchlay> Prefer C. Or perl.
[00:19:32] <Urchlay> not programming professionally now though, I'm basically out of the industry
[00:19:41] <JarJar> seriously?
[00:19:44] <Urchlay> ever seen Office Space? Kinda like that.
[00:19:50] <JarJar> well that happens

[00:21:15] <Urchlay> nah, I didn't do anything evil to those people
[00:21:27] <JarJar> but i'll check it when i get some time
[00:21:58] <JarJar> well i always try to make each project succeed
[00:22:10] <JarJar> that doesn't go for everyone either :)
[00:22:15] <KaMii> like on office space?
[00:22:19] <Urchlay> they were all paranoid & afraid I might, so they tried various things they thought would stop me... truth is, I was the only competent one in the tech department, and if I'd wanted their servers dead, they would have been (but probably I'd have been in jail too...)

[00:33:16] <zltan> wood_quinn: does it make any difference? Or did you mean that I need customization?
[00:33:41] <wood_quinn> You really shouldn't install -current packages on 14.0.
[00:33:42] <zltan> Urchlay: no, that's the reason why I installed 3.7.1 kernel
[00:34:08] <zltan> I think the situation got better after I switched to 3.7.1 and compat-wireless
[00:34:20] <Urchlay> zltan: did it have the same problem with the old kernel, or did it just not work at all or something?
[00:34:44] <zltan> Urchlay: the old 3.2.29 had similar problem

[00:35:26] <Urchlay> if the wireless card's removable, try it in a different machine and/or try a different card in that machine
[00:35:30] <zltan> Urchlay: actually I tried with another adapter, another atheros card

[00:36:32] <Urchlay> it's not a known issue in slackware (at least, I don't think so), it might be a known issue with the kernel driver for that card
[00:37:02] <zltan> and reboot always temporarily removes the problem
[00:37:21] <Urchlay> try a completely different card (that uses a different driver entirely). If you still have the trouble, it's probably your AP
[00:37:46] <zltan> Urchlay: yes I did, the atheros card is totally different from iwl3945
[00:37:55] <Urchlay> ah. OK.
[00:38:15] <zltan> ath5k vs iwl3945
[00:38:34] <Urchlay> so either it's a general problem with the kernel (that affects all wireless, which I doubt since we'd all have the problem by now), or it's your AP. Have you tried with a different AP already?
[00:39:52] <Urchlay> or, it could be something goofy, like, your neighbor's air conditioner or refrigerator emits some funky interference that eventually causes the card to drop too many packets and switch to a slower speed
[00:40:11] <wood_quinn> I think that's a more likely scenario.
[00:40:29] Lorem-Ipsum (~Lorem-Ips@unaffiliated/lorem-ipsum) left irc: Ping timeout: 245 seconds
[00:40:30] <zltan> Urchlay: if it is because of the AP, then reconnecting should work, which is actually to no avail
[00:40:46] <wood_quinn> Why would reconnecting fix it?
[00:40:51] <Urchlay> when you first boot, run "iwconfig", note what it says for Bit Rate... after the trouble starts, run iwconfig again, see if the bit rate has changed
[00:41:27] <zltan> if this problem was caused by the AP, then reboot and reconnect/modprobe are essentially the same I think
[00:41:51] <theborger> have you tried to rest the AP?
[00:42:06] NitroGL (~NitroGL@gateway/tor-sasl/nitrogl) joined ##slackware.
[00:42:07] <zltan> theborger: I did
[00:42:10] <Urchlay> and look at the other stats of course. I found out that, if the planets are aligned just right, I can sometimes connect (by accident) to my neighbor's open access point. Which works about as fast as a dialup, at the distance I am from it.
[00:42:19] <wood_quinn> If the problem is being caused by the AP, any connections to the AP will have the problem.
[00:43:09] <wood_quinn> It's fairly unlikely that the cause is the sustained connection.
[00:43:29] <core_saint> no not really...
[00:43:29] <core_saint> i used to connect to my ap with no issues from windows and symbian
[00:43:35] <core_saint> but from linux once in a while it used to block connection

[00:44:38] <core_saint> after i have updated software on ap it worked fine
[00:44:40] <Urchlay> zltan: I'd be interested to know if iwconfig shows the bit rate has dropped, when the speed slows down

[00:44:53] <zltan> Urchlay: how can I tell that?
[00:45:01] <Urchlay> what I said above
[00:45:22] <Urchlay> 19:33 <Urchlay> when you first boot, run "iwconfig", note what it says for Bit Rate... after the trouble starts, run iwconfig again, see if the bit rate has changed
[00:46:31] <zltan> Urchlay: ok, I will keep an eye on it
[00:46:40] <Urchlay> maybe it starts out using 802.11g, and after it gets a certain number of errors or loses sync or whatever, it drops back to 802.11b (slow bit rate, possibly more reliable)
[00:47:35] <Urchlay> rmmod/insmod might be failing to fix it because the hardware's not being reset to its default powerup state, by the driver

[00:55:09] <wood_quinn> If the cost of running an app is KDE, I wonder if it's really worth it.
[00:55:52] <wood_quinn> You probably just need the kdelibs package anyway.
[00:56:33] <Urchlay> darwin: if you actually do submit a working TDE build to SBo, I'll try my app with it, and submit it if it can be made to work.

[02:49:14] <Skywise> if women ever showed up it would be total chaos
[02:49:32] <BrokenCog> or ... is "multi-monitor" a euphism like "once, in bad camp ... "
[02:49:38] <BrokenCog> *band
[02:49:52] <Skywise> same difference
[02:49:53] <shonudo> no, sometimes "multi-monitor" just refers to a buttload of monitors
[02:50:31] <Skywise> sometimes a cigar is just a cigar
[02:50:35] <foobarz> wow, my character encoding as bad... i had append vt.default_ut8=0 and lang = en_US  ... no UTF8 support and ended up with invalid encoding on lots of my filenames

[02:52:50] <foobarz> files with bad encoding cannot be accessed well with cd command or in file managers
[02:52:58] <Skywise> theres prolly a way, like with tunefs to change that
[02:53:01] <foobarz> a little tricky to even rename them
[02:53:27] <shonudo> if it's a one-by-one you're going to hate life
[02:53:34] <Skywise> but i don't know cause i'd never do such a thing
[02:54:37] <foobarz> lang should really be en_US.UTF8 shouldn't it?
[02:55:44] <Urchlay> -8
[02:55:50] <Urchlay> en_US.UTF-8
[02:55:57] <wood_quinn> =7
[02:56:21] <Skywise> i don't see an option to change character set in tune2fs
[02:56:41] <Urchlay> pretty sure there's no such thing as a character set setting for ext2/3/4
[02:56:58] <Skywise> yeah, so what are we fixing again?

[02:58:39] <Urchlay> foobarz: bash should at least be able to tab-complete the filenames, so you can rename them

[03:01:13] <chasmo> slack 12.2 does not have that kernel. I think I'll try mounting the CD-ROM on another system and just look. Was thinking there was some sort of function key to list them out.
[03:01:18] <foobarz> Urchlay: okay, I got en_US.UTF-8 enabled in my /etc/profile.d/lang.sh|csh and append = vt.default_utf8=1    am I all good for utf8 ?

[03:29:32] <Urchlay> dunno, but that'll definitely cause it
[03:30:13] <n1x4> Yo.... anyone have a clue how to remove that little vesafb penguin logo when booting?
[03:30:35] <BrokenCog> n1x4: you mean the one for each core?
[03:31:11] <Urchlay> one way would be to add 'append=vga=normal' to lilo.conf... but you probably don't actually want to turn off framebuffer (it's required for KMS, and too many X drivers rely on KMS these days)
[03:31:19] <n1x4> Don't think so.... I'm talking about the one that sit in the upper left hand corner during the boot process
[03:31:31] <Urchlay> yeah, that's what BrokenCog is talking about too
[03:31:34] <n1x4> Yea but I like vesafb...
[03:31:38] <n1x4> Oh, ok

[03:32:04] <BrokenCog> that's part of the linux kernel - look in the config, in video,boot,logo section i think.
[03:32:19] <Urchlay> you could run the -generic kernel and only modprobe vesafb later on in the boot

[03:32:24] kermit (unknown@pdpc/supporter/bronze/kermit) joined ##slackware.
[03:32:28] <BrokenCog> nothing to do with fb.
[03:32:39] <d4wnr4z0r> indeed
[03:32:45] <Urchlay> (are you sure you're really using vesafb? and not a more card-specific fb driver like inteldrmfb?)
[03:32:59] <n1x4> Really? Uh, figured since vga=normal disabled it it did... lul
[03:33:04] <Urchlay> BrokenCog: well, sort of, it is. If you don't use framebuffer at all, you don't see any penguins
[03:33:13] <n1x4> vga=791
[03:33:28] <BrokenCog> not sure what's wrong with it ...  I remember being shocked when the first time I booted a dual cpu machine and got TWO!!  ... all those years with only one penguin at boot time!
[03:33:48] <BrokenCog> Urchlay: okay ... true.
[03:33:52] <n1x4> HAHAH, right on... might try it on my quad later
[03:34:04] <BrokenCog> n1x4: you should the 8 core ...
[03:34:07] <BrokenCog> *see the
[03:34:12] <n1x4> Indeed!
[03:34:14] <Urchlay> what's mildly wrong with it is that sometimes (not sure why), the penguin doesn't go away, and your effective useful screen space is reduced
[03:34:39] <BrokenCog> never had that ... although I tend not to live in the FB anymore.
[03:34:41] <Urchlay> like when you hit the bottom of the screen and it goes to scroll, it doesn't scroll away the penguin
[03:34:42] <n1x4> Eehh... might switch back to vga=normal if that happens
[03:34:51] <Skywise> its pretty cool seeing all those penguins lined up
[03:34:53] <Urchlay> I can't remember exactly what causes it to happen
[03:35:01] <Skywise> i'd like it if they did the rockettes thing or something
[03:35:11] <Urchlay> there's a way to fix it though
[03:35:28] <BrokenCog> during boot?  I think it's suppuose to stay duering the boot process.  should only scroll when kernel swithes to multi-user mode.
[03:35:32] <Urchlay> it's especially annoying if you replace the penguin with a fullscreen graphic
[03:35:54] <n1x4> I'm gonna compile a new kernel probably tommorow so I'll look and see if I can get rid of that thing
[03:36:03] <Urchlay> right, I know, but under some circumstances, it doesn't go away in multiuser mode
[03:36:23] <Urchlay> can't remember why, or whether it's been permanently fixed in slackware or not
[03:36:47] <Urchlay> n1x4: you can actually replace the graphic with anything you like, if you're going to recompile the kernel
[03:37:07] <n1x4> Honestly, I'd rather not have anything.
[03:37:19] <Urchlay> heh, replace it with a windows 95 'Windows is starting up' screen :)
[03:37:20] <n1x4> To me it doesn't belong there ya know

[04:13:31] <fiyawerx> i should put a vm on my server to handle distcc when my other machines are doing something since it's almost always idle
[04:13:45] <bastard> hello i have trouble logging in to my server using the keyfile i have generated, i have edited authorized_keys from the remote server and then i have added the key but when i use ssh -i key.pub from my machine it doesn`t work
[04:14:43] <n1x4> Thnaks, I'll check it out right quick....
[04:15:31] <bastard> i just want to use the keyfile when i login to my cs servers, that`s all

[04:17:29] <bastard> i have used putty untill now and putty has .ppk keyfile which works perfectly fine and i did not have to edit any ssh configuration file, just add the hash to authorized_keys and that`s all
[04:18:52] <n1x4> IIRC you need to edit sshd_conf to allow for it to check RSA keys(host box) and ssh conf file to use the RSA key on the remote box.
[04:19:50] <bastard> ok i will take a look at it right now and try again
[04:19:50] <n1x4> Don't quote me though, it has been a minute since I've neede RSA auth keys.
[04:20:29] <mishehu> hmm...  for some reason it's taking like 30 seconds to 1 minute to open up files mounted via nfs...  even after I restart nfs on the server.  does anybody have any suggestions as to what to look for?  (the same configuration used to work just fine.  possibly kernel 3.6.9 has something to do with it?)

[04:26:38] <bastard> n1x4 but why putty`s .ppk file works on anything without editing the sshd_config file ? isn`t there a way so the new key i generated just works after i add it to authorized_keys ?
[04:28:02] <n1x4> Never used putty bro. Did you put the generated (renamed to authoriezed_keys) file in your ~/.ssh direcotry?

[04:31:17] <_`_> Hi, I have a networking question I can't seem to figure out thought I try asking here:
[04:31:19] <mishehu> shonudo: it's not ipv6.  I set the mount via ipv4 address and not via hostname, and it still is lagged.
[04:31:31] <_`_> I have two interfaces wlan0 and eth0: wlan0 leases an ip via dhcpcd and eth0 has a static ip manually set. But when both are in play, all outward connections try to go through eth0. Not sure how to make wlan0 default.
[04:31:38] <_`_> This is pretty much how I bring up both interfaces: http://sprunge.us/cBjC
[04:31:43] <_`_> This might be relevant information: http://sprunge.us/PVbK

[05:10:25] <maciuszek> havent played the game in a while tho
[05:10:29] <Urchlay> other than the lack of a single-player game and monsters, q3 was an improvement, for me (no more adding a mod to play CTF)

[05:14:51] <d4wnr4z0r> so it was like, "here's half the game that q2 was, love it", a very government thing to do
[05:15:04] <Urchlay> I never liked "online" over the internet with random people on a server anyway. LAN parties are fun, and 'net games on a private server with friends
[05:15:44] <d4wnr4z0r> lan games with friends are definitely best
[05:15:59] <Urchlay> but playing on public servers sucks. Bunch of kids who don't have to make a living so they can play quake 12 hours a day, and have superior reflexes because they're 30 years younger than me... and they act like complete douches
[05:17:03] <Urchlay> I don't mind getting my ass kicked, but getting my ass kicked and then being teabagged and insulted in chat, eh, if I want abuse I'll get it in some more entertaining way
[05:17:39] <Urchlay> walk into a biker bar and yell "harley-davidson sucks ass!" maybe

[06:23:23] <Urchlay> mplayer's xv backend has worked well for me, for a long time now
[06:23:59] <Jdogzz> It's okay, but I'd like that extra power boost from my graphics card in hopes of using additional filters to clean up the video.
[06:24:16] <Jdogzz> Not to mention the fact that some videos lag even with all the stops pulled out.
[06:24:41] <Urchlay> hmmm, what are you watching, ¸ber-high-def stuff?

[06:30:07] <FrankD> dont remember, all i know is that its definitely accelerating decode
[06:30:13] <FrankD> not near the machine right now
[06:30:34] <Jdogzz> Hmmmm... Mine outputs a version so I was wondering if there was something different you did to get it working.
[06:30:41] <Jdogzz> *outputs an error
[06:30:58] <FrankD> do you have mplayer with vaapi compiled already?
[06:31:13] <FrankD> also.. export LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME="fglrx"
[06:31:25] <Jdogzz> Compiled both the standard version and the version on the libva website.
[06:31:58] <Jdogzz> And just to double check, you run it like "mplayer -vo vaapi -ao alsa /path/to/file"?
[06:32:05] <FrankD> mplayer -vo vaapi -va vaapi
[06:32:06] splud (~nobody@centrosphere-fw.professional.org) left irc: Quit: The Grinch then carved the Roast Beast!
[06:32:12] <FrankD> and you NEED that export
[06:32:19] <FrankD> or youll get an error
[06:32:32] <Jdogzz> Let me double check to see if it will work now, maybe I reset it by accident.
[06:33:17] <FrankD> pastebin the error you get now too
[06:33:35] <FrankD> god id kill for a cigarette right about now
[06:33:37] <Jdogzz> It says that va is an unknown option.
[06:33:45] <FrankD> then you dont have vaapi support in mplayer

[06:39:21] <FrankD> well then, svn co a new mplayer :p

[06:59:41] <Urchlay> Jdogzz (and/or FrankD)... if you guys get that working, ought to submit a mplayer-vaapi to slackbuilds.org
[07:01:47] <darwin> is there any way to have something in the .bashrc of a wheel user such as 'alias mount="sudo mount?"' and have it work?
[07:01:59] <darwin> I never got into the habit of letting a GUI mount things, and I dislike doing so
[07:02:18] <darwin> or is there a way to just allow a user to mount something when they are not root and not in a GUI?
[07:03:13] <Urchlay> add it to /etc/fstab with 'noauto,user' options... but that's not dynamic (if you plug in a USB drive, you don't know what /dev/sd? node it'll be, or whether it's partitioned or not)
[07:03:52] <Urchlay> you *could* list all of /dev/sdb through /dev/sdz (and sdb1, sdb2, etc)
[07:06:00] (##slackware) Channel ban on *!~root@* expired.
[07:06:02] ##slackware: mode change '-b *!~root@*' by g0v!~g0v@phra.gs
[07:09:04] <Jdogzz> It's a bit annoying that they had to fork this to add support, it would be nice if they concentrated their efforts on improving the master branch.
[07:09:11] <Jdogzz> But, that's freedom I suppose:)
[07:10:34] <Urchlay> is it a total fork, different devs, etc? or just a different svn branch?
[07:10:46] <Master-Passeli> good morning slackers o/
[07:11:15] <ventYl> damn radeon
[07:11:38] <Jdogzz> Urchlay: Not entirely sure what the differences are but they take the master branch of mplayer and add in the vaapi support.
[07:13:11] <Urchlay> maybe it makes a lot of invasive changes, spread out over a lot of difference source files
[07:13:46] <Urchlay> or, it required massive changes to code the main branch maintainers don't want changed until it's thoroughly tested

[07:22:03] <KaMii> hrm.. i guess southpark does teach you things
[07:22:11] <KaMii> i didnt know the USA banned books
[07:22:47] <Jdogzz> The Diary of Anne Frank was banned for a long time.
[07:22:55] <KaMii> thought that was against freedom of speach
[07:23:32] <Jdogzz> Most of the time it's done because of the "danger" to children, exposing them to bad ideas and garbage like that.
[07:23:55] <KaMii> makes no sense, they ban catcher in the rye but allow counter strike games and stuff like that on xbox and playstation
[07:24:07] <KaMii> this country has its head all the way up its own asshole
[07:24:32] <Jdogzz> Exactly:) And the reason for that is because video games generate money and books don't:)
[07:24:55] <KaMii> so why ban a book then?
[07:24:57] <KaMii> since no one reads
[07:25:32] <Jdogzz> It's done to appease the conservative parents who don't want their children being taught that in school.
[07:25:42] <Urchlay> KaMii: "banned books" are only banned in public schools and maybe government-funded libraries. The government generally can't ban a book from being published or sold in stores
[07:25:44] <Jdogzz> They want the right to destroy their children's minds themsevles.

[07:26:08] <Urchlay> violent video games and porn are also banned in public schools :)
[07:26:10] <KaMii> Urchlay: well that still sounds really stupid
[07:26:23] <KaMii> ban a book in a public school?
[07:26:40] <Urchlay> I didn't say it was a good idea, or that I approved
[07:26:46] <KaMii> do they ban anatomy books too because they talk about the nudie parts?
[07:26:56] timahvo1 (~rogue@41.90.226.148) joined ##slackware.
[07:27:08] <Urchlay> but it's not as bad as "you go to jail if you get caught reading this" like it's been in some countries
[07:27:19] <KaMii> meh, seems everyday i find out that freedom is just another huge lie in the USA....
[07:27:34] <ventYl> Urchlay: it's like when i take banned book into school someone comes and shoots me to head?
[07:27:43] <KaMii> why send someone to jail for reading a book?
[07:28:07] <KaMii> so if a kid went to school with a banned book, they would get arrested?
[07:28:08] <KaMii> lmfao
[07:28:45] <Urchlay> no, he probably gets suspended from school (which is bad, but not as bad as going to jail)
[07:28:54] <KaMii> are you for real?
[07:29:02] <KaMii> well hes probably better off then
[07:29:19] <KaMii> at least he will read the book at home then
[07:30:12] <ventYl> in fact banning the book has exactly opposite effect
[07:30:21] <ventYl> because what is banned that is attractive
[07:30:46] <KaMii> if i got suspended for reading a book in school, my parents would sue the school
[07:30:48] <Urchlay> huckleberry finn. Back when it was written, it was controversial for being anti-slavery and pro-black rights
[07:30:57] <KaMii> then probably move back to sweden, then sue the school again
[07:30:57] <Urchlay> now it's banned because it contains the N-word
[07:31:19] <KaMii> neadertaal?
[07:31:21] <KaMii> lol
[07:31:49] <Urchlay> no, but if neanderthals were around, I'm sure lots of homo sapiens would discriminate against them
[07:31:59] <ventYl> Urchlay: sometimes i have feeling that the best what we can do with ourselves is to start nucelar disaster
[07:32:06] <Jdogzz> See the Geico commercials.
[07:32:27] <KaMii> Urchlay: and we would be right to do so
[07:32:27] <Urchlay> I don't watch commercials
[07:32:31] <KaMii> lol
[07:32:55] <Urchlay> KaMii: depends. If they're smart, they talk and think... why hate them?
[07:33:07] <KaMii> it was a joke
[07:33:11] <Urchlay> oh, right
[07:33:15] <KaMii> but you know we would
[07:33:31] <KaMii> and the attitude would be, we are ligitimately able to do so
[07:34:01] <KaMii> then there would be specisism
[07:34:24] <KaMii> but.. that already happened, and we killed them all
[07:34:31] <Urchlay> jury's still out on whether they were even a separate species. It's possible humans and neanderthals could interbreed...
[07:34:36] <KaMii> so... i guess in a way maybe we should feel bad?
[07:34:44] <Urchlay> (of course, so can horses and donkeys, but they're not the same species)
[07:34:59] <KaMii> and they give a bastard offspring thats sterile
[07:35:10] <KaMii> one way is a donkey, one way is a mule right?
[07:35:14] <Urchlay> yeah
[07:35:29] <KaMii> the russians tried to get a human ape hybrid during the cold war
[07:35:41] <KaMii> they tried human man vs ape female
[07:35:47] <Urchlay> I'm only gonna feel so bad about something that happened so long ago, writing wasn't invented yet
[07:36:01] <KaMii> then they were about to impregnate a human female with an ape sperm, but they ran out of funding or something
[07:36:16] <Urchlay> KaMii: that's because it seemed like a fun thing to do, due to all the vodka they drank :)

[08:29:09] <ventYl> yes, there's something like cp /proc/mounts /etc/mtab somewhere in rc.S

[08:31:10] <KaMii> didnt he setup his mount points during the setup
[08:31:56] <ventYl> dunno. if things are done properly there's nearly zero change the system won't boot
[08:32:36] <ventYl> except LVM setups which are non-trivial to create for unexperienced users
[08:32:59] <ventYl> that's why i always need to chroot to fresh install from install DVD. i always forget to create initrd
[08:33:06] <KaMii> i think he never did a multi partition install before and didnt know that /home is /home not /home/username

[09:27:58] <Urchlay> dosbox = useless for windows directX games

[09:28:23] <ventYl> depends

[13:37:31] <darwin> I recall reading Patrick Volkerding did not like Linux Standard Base (LSB) for some reason like it did too much to a distro that was not worth it and made it harder for serious users
[13:37:50] <darwin> but now I read on Wikipedia LSB is what makes GNU/Linux closer to the POSIX standard
[13:38:04] <darwin> if LSB is closer to POSIX, what would be the reason for a distro not using it?
[13:38:30] <darwin> at least as an option
[13:39:44] <darwin> maybe that was not the exact reason
[13:39:54] <darwin> but Pat did not like it for some reasonable reason
[13:40:40] <fuzzix> You have to support RPM?

[13:44:24] <fuzzix> notklaatu: Indeed.

[15:04:17] <blindman_> Hi. I'm having problems with usb wifi Ralink rt3072 on Slackware 14 Arm (Raspberry Pi). The same usb wifi works out of the box on my destkop computer with Slack 14. It looks like it uses rt2800usb, rt2800lib, rt2x00. At least that's the only rt* modules loaded on the desktop. I keep modprobing them it doesn't seem to help. Thanks

[15:09:03] <zvacet> what should I do how to add user to grups
[15:10:34] <zvacet> # useradd -m -g users -G wheel,floppy,audio,video,cdrom,plugdev,power,netdev,lp,scanner -s /bin/bash slacker obviously doesn¥t work
[15:12:03] <ShadowX> adduser -G [group_name] [username]
[15:12:15] <ShadowX> example: adduser -G floppy slacker
[15:12:29] <ShadowX> ^ this will add slackerto floppy group.
[15:12:45] <pink_mist> just "adduser slacker", and when you get to the additional groups prompt, add all the groups..
[15:12:56] <ventYl> or press key "down"
[15:13:05] <pink_mist> yeah

[15:13:13] <pink_mist> actually
[15:13:14] <pink_mist> up
[15:13:25] <ShadowX> ^^ yeah. if you haven't allready added the user. just adduser and key down/up when asked about groups.
[15:13:26] <ventYl> i'm pretty sure nobody reads the huge several lines long message before adding user to group
[15:13:51] <Nh3xus> or read it too quickly
[15:14:16] <hackedhead> if the user already exists, you want usermod
[15:14:22] <zvacet> pink_mist: I already have user but it look it is not in grups i tried to follow http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:beginners_guide
[15:14:37] <pink_mist> then you want usermod, like hackedhead said
[15:14:49] <hackedhead> usermod -aG <group> <user>
[15:14:55] <zvacet> ShadowX: and I have to repeat that command for every grup
[15:15:14] <slava_dp> I just use vigr

[15:16:25] <hackedhead> zvacet: usermod -aG group1,group2,group3  <user> works, yes
[15:16:25] <zvacet> hackedhead: or that is command just for one group
[15:16:26] <ShadowX> zvacet : btw my bad, usermod -a -G group1,group2,group3 username
[15:16:35] <ShadowX> useradd -G fails with existing user :/
[15:16:38] <Nh3xus> I have a question about the Intel wireless microcodes that Pat ships with Slack
[15:16:51] <ShadowX> but you can add multiple groups , jsut use commas between them.
[15:16:52] <hackedhead> ShadowX: yes, hence why usermod exists
[15:17:30] <ShadowX> hackedhead: i'm from the old generation of slackers :D i do those things with vi/nano :)
[15:17:34] <zvacet> hackedhead: I will try that now I will let you how it goes after reboot  :)
[15:17:46] <hackedhead> should only require relogin, not reboot
[15:18:34] <slava_dp> vipw / vigr ftw!
[15:18:38] <Nh3xus> In 13.37 there was the 3945 microcode in /n/ but it's not longer available on the /n/ dir of Slack 14. That means that this microcode has been included in the recent 3.2.29 kernel ?

[16:25:06] <Zordrak> Anyone using mod_authnz_external with pwauth on slack? I'm having difficulty with an error code 50. Docs suggest this means a bad user has called /usr/libexec/pwauth
[16:25:48] <pprkut> thumbs: that is not quite correct. Most of the new 5.6 features will eventually end up in MariaDB 10.x, but since many of them will be reimplemented that is still a way off
[16:25:51] <Zordrak> I used bob's slackbuild, which defines users 72,80 (non-exist,apache) and i tried it with 99,80 (nobody,apache) which is what i think bob intended in the first place.. but I'm, still getting the same failure

[16:28:14] <thumbs> pprkut: anyway, my comment was based on a /query we had a few Months ago.
[16:28:17] <pprkut> last I heard 10.0 will go GA towards summer, but will not contain all of the new 5.6 features
[16:28:51] <thumbs> pprkut: perhaps it was overly optimistic when we talked
[16:29:29] <thumbs> pprkut: he does like to boast from time to tim
[16:29:37] <pprkut> hehe
[16:29:49] <Skywise> is 10.0 the next version of mariadb
[16:29:56] <pprkut> next major, yes

[16:32:41] <Skywise> any chance of replication getting more straight forward?
[16:33:01] <thumbs> heh?
[16:33:09] <thumbs> replication is already too easy
[16:33:18] <Skywise> i wish you could just point a source at a target and say go, instead of having to go thru all the steps you do now
[16:33:27] <thumbs> all the steps?
[16:33:40] <thumbs> mysqldump --master-data, import, start slave

[16:34:48] <thumbs> how much easier do you want it to be? Do you want a wizard to hold your hand? :)
[16:35:42] <TheM4ch1n3> like harry potter ?
[16:36:31] <Skywise> don't you have to flush tables with a read lock first and then get the binary file log position

[16:36:45] <Skywise> i had to look up those steps cause i couldn't remember them
[16:37:01] <thumbs> what do you think --master-data does?
[16:37:08] <thumbs> with InnoDB, use --single-transaction too
[16:37:18] <thumbs> with MyISAM, just rsync the datadir
[16:37:55] <Skywise> that way isn't in the docs
[16:38:03] <thumbs> it's in the replication docs.
[16:38:41] <Skywise> they still say you have to do the read lock
[16:39:10] <thumbs> for MyISAM, yes.
[16:39:28] <thumbs> you shouldn't be using MyISAM, anyway
[16:39:53] <Skywise> i've got a mix of legacy databases

[16:47:00] <FLYSWATER> no
[16:47:25] <FLYSWATER> are you talking about when I used the cd to boot?
[16:48:04] <Skywise> yeah,when you boot the cd and leave the partitions unmounted
[16:48:22] <FLYSWATER> hm
[16:48:30] <Skywise> don't use the cd to boot the partition with
[16:48:42] <FLYSWATER> cant remember what command i used to boot from the cd to hd
[16:49:04] <Skywise> you don't have to, it says so when it first boots up
[16:49:26] <Skywise> but don't boot the hd, just go to the prompt
[16:49:38] <FLYSWATER> hm
[16:49:52] <Skywise> then you can fsck the drive
[16:50:03] <Skywise> and hopefully that will repair whatever is wrong
[16:50:08] <FLYSWATER> well it wouldnt even give me a promt
[16:50:17] <Skywise> the cd?
[16:50:20] <FLYSWATER> it would just get stuck at loading linux
[16:50:49] <Skywise> you sure it only got turned off?
[16:50:55] <FLYSWATER> yes
[16:51:32] <Skywise> you should prolly have bios check your memory, but i don't see why it won't boot the cd
[16:51:52] <FLYSWATER> it got bumpped or something my screens came on then they went off and my main screen went to black and white text then shut down
[16:51:58] <FLYSWATER> I was like noo
[16:52:08] <FLYSWATER> but thankfully the cd worked to boot

[18:46:09] <Skywise> yeah, thats nuts, he said his block heaters cables are rock hard and stiff now
[18:46:10] <eviljames> I used to live in Vancouver.  1C and a bit of rain or snow and the world might as well have stopped turning.  Nobody dared to leave their house..
[18:46:18] <NightTiger> It's -17C here in Ottawa. 1F. Cold.
[18:46:26] <eviljames> Cold indeed.
[18:46:44] <Skywise> you canadians need to keep that cold over on your side of the fence
[18:46:58] <Skywise> its so rude to let it spill down here
[18:47:09] <NightTiger> We just like to share... :-)
[18:47:31] <eviljames> Our apologies, we'll try to keep the hockey weather to ourselves.  Thought you folks were starting to get the hang of that game and wanted a bit, though...
[18:47:42] <Skywise> nope not this year
[18:47:57] <Skywise> did they strike in canada too? i didn't think that was allowed
[18:49:59] <eviljames> yeah, the NHL owners locked the players out of the arenas.
[18:50:23] <eviljames> It was not a strike, it was a lockout.

[22:22:57] <Skaperen> swapon to a file via loopback does not need it to be contiguous
[22:22:57] <pi31415> defragmented

[22:24:27] <Skaperen> DarthEaron: if it is contiguous, then that holds true
[22:24:51] <Skaperen> though some may argue reverse contiguous is still contiguous
[22:25:12] <Skywise> contiguous means theres no gap in the allocation of blocks
[22:25:49] tmkd (~tomek@193.106.244.66) left ##slackware.
[22:26:18] <macavity> Skywise: a swap file is treated as a continous block device, and the kernel has the appropriate optimizations which are possible only on flat files
[22:26:26] <macavity> Skaperen: ^^
[22:27:20] <macavity> Skaperen: if your file has holes quite a few things go bonkers, not just when reading (doing ofsets based on page sizes), but also when writing
[22:27:46] <Skywise> would seem to be a vector for mischief
[22:28:54] <Skywise> but i don't think an unprivileged user can write to a specific block or even know what block was needed
[22:29:33] <macavity> Skaperen: when you write to a holey file and you write past the "jump point" a few complicated things happen that is exactly what you do not want at swap time
[22:30:29] <Skaperen> it can't allocate the space?
[22:30:52] <macavity> Skaperen: i am not 100% sure, but it seems to me that, if the file[s] being swapped out is large enough, the double buffer alocation could cause pretty much the same effect as if you were trying to "$EDITOR /dev/mem"
[22:30:53] PeQuEnO_TuX (~Reggie@c-24-128-86-226.hsd1.nh.comcast.net) joined ##slackware.
[22:31:35] <Skaperen> swapping of VM to a file
[22:31:47] <macavity> Skaperen: it can alocate it, but that requires memory, which causes the kernel to swap out something more to make that memory, which ... you get the picture :P
[22:32:05] NightTiger (~derekm@tunnel.roaringpenguin.com) left irc: Quit: NightTiger
[22:32:21] <macavity> Skaperen: you can only swap out virtual memory.. if the kernel runs out of space you get a panic
[22:33:01] <Skaperen> actually, no it doesn't to do an allocation ... I think the issue is it BYPASSES vfs ... it just asks for where the block is and bypasses vfs to write it ... but if it's not allocated, that would fail
[22:34:14] <macavity> that would presume that the file is continious
[22:34:29] <Skaperen> unless it asks where on a block by block basis
[22:34:32] <macavity> and that is not something we can guarentee simply with dd
[22:34:53] <Skaperen> right, dd does not make it contiguous ... but it does not need to be contiguous
[22:35:34] <macavity> Skaperen: if it asks on a block by block basis, then holey files should not be a problem
[22:35:42] <PeQuEnO_TuX> hello all

[22:35:48] <Skaperen> swapon /dev/ramdisk

[22:44:38] <usr13> FYI; I just installed lxde on Slackware 14.0 and it seems pretty nice. Here is the list of packages if anyone's interested: http://pastebin.com/FLdMSwtV
[22:44:45] <dive> msn is dead
[22:44:51] <Skaperen> just set up multilib and 32-bit dynamic programs work
[22:45:13] <Skaperen> or if they happen to have a "fully static" build, that would work, too
[22:45:25] <macavity> dive: so is skype.. but apparently the world refuses to catch up :P
[22:45:47] <dive> macavity, I mean that MS have turned off MSN
[22:45:47] <usr13> macavity: Why is skype dead?
[22:46:00] <dive> they want people to use skype now
[22:46:05] <usr13> ... just because MS bought it?
[22:46:07] <Skaperen> what to use different than skype (has to do all that skype can do) ?
[22:46:38] <dive> well for video/audio probably ekiga
[22:46:41] <Skaperen> skype still has some latent nervous flitter
[22:46:48] <macavity> there are lots of other ones that can do what skype can do.. and each of them have like a 100 users you can call :-/
[22:47:16] <usr13> macavity: What do you consider as viable alternatives?
[22:47:20] <Skaperen> so how do people on Windows, Mac, BSD, and Linux communicate through a common server?
[22:47:30] <dive> skype
[22:47:33] <usr13> yep
[22:47:40] <macavity> usr13: none really.. due to the lack of users
[22:47:50] <Skaperen> with text, audio, and if enough b/w also video
[22:47:50] <dive> lack of users is not a problem
[22:47:57] <PeQuEnO_TuX> pidgin do not support for camera
[22:47:59] <usr13> oh well, skype works so i use it.
[22:48:10] <dive> if your family and friends are using it that's all the users you need
[22:48:10] <Skaperen> right now skype works
[22:48:27] <macavity> PeQuEnO_TuX: then setup multilib according to alienBOB's tutorial and use skype
[22:48:34] <Skaperen> but reconsider my question with a "native 64 bit requirement"
[22:48:36] <macavity> PeQuEnO_TuX: just read it carefully a couple of times
[22:48:42] <PeQuEnO_TuX> gonna check right now
[22:48:51] <Skaperen> sadly there are lots of half arsed attempts out there
[22:48:53] <PeQuEnO_TuX> thanks for the help

[22:49:16] <PeQuEnO_TuX> i already install skype but i got some error
[22:49:20] <dive> I use a hardware voip phone going through an asterisk server
[22:49:21] <macavity> PeQuEnO_TuX: really, read it over *at least* twice before you begin, and *ask* if you are the slightest bit in doubt
[22:49:38] <macavity> PeQuEnO_TuX: as it is potentially dangerous if you get it wrong
[22:50:05] <PeQuEnO_TuX> i thinsk i beter ideia install 32bits
[22:50:13] <PeQuEnO_TuX> because im not that good
[22:50:13] <Skaperen> the one feature I do NOT need ... but probably many people do ... is being able to dial out to the world of "numbers only" phones
[22:50:23] <PeQuEnO_TuX> i mean dunno anything about linux
[22:50:35] <dive> Skaperen, ekiga can do both
[22:50:37] <PeQuEnO_TuX> stop use it about 10years ago

[22:55:02] <macavity> PeQuEnO_TuX: the error you get is related to not having 32bit libs

[22:58:35] <macavity> no, you did not get the same error in the console.. as kdeinit does not try to launch it from bash..
[22:58:52] <macavity> but you are probably better off with a 32 bit slackware anyway...
[22:59:10] <dive> hmmmm?
[22:59:21] <dive> nothing wrong with multilib

[23:00:36] <macavity> dive: btw, xfce4-terminal-0.6.1 now has --drop-down in case you want it :P
[23:00:48] <dive> not really
[23:00:55] <dive> I use urxvt
[23:01:12] <dive> got 4 terms permanently on workspace 1
[23:01:18] <macavity> oh, right, i remember
[23:01:33] <macavity> urxvt has a nice tab feature too
[23:01:44] <dive> better without tabs and use screen

[23:03:41] <PeQuEnO_TuX> not from my console same error from alt+f2
[23:03:46] <PeQuEnO_TuX> console is bash: /usr/bin/skype: No such file or directory
[23:03:58] <dive> PeQuEnO_TuX, right that's because skype is 32 bit
[23:04:39] <PeQuEnO_TuX> dive i start learn something about multilib

[23:13:40] <dive> No, it should called rxvt-unicode
[23:13:42] <usr13> macavity: Ok, well it's not on slackbuilds, (not yet anyway).
[23:13:44] Action: dive hides
[23:14:02] <dive> it won't be on slackbuilds
[23:14:04] <macavity> usr13: it wont be
[23:14:08] <usr13> O
[23:14:15] <dive> it's a stock package
[23:14:21] <macavity> usr13: slackbuilds does not offer packages that are already in slackware
[23:14:32] <Blueleaf> can anyone help a quasi-noob install openoffice on slackware 14.0? -o

[23:15:06] <dive> Blueleaf, it's on slackbuilds.org
[23:15:08] <dive> and also
[23:15:09] <macavity> usr13: as i said, yours is called Terminal
[23:15:16] <dive> use LibreOffice
[23:15:30] <macavity> usr13: but it changes name to xfce4-terminal with next release
[23:15:30] <shonudo> ^^
[23:15:41] <shonudo> use libreoffice... don't bother with OOo
[23:15:46] <usr13> macavity: Oh ok.
[23:15:58] <shonudo> or is it OOO (Open Office Oracle)?
[23:16:12] <macavity> usr13: but a tiny bit of hacking around in Terminal.SlackBuild should get you up and running in no time

[23:17:52] <usr13> macavity: Well, don't really know what "drop-down" does.... so..
[23:18:20] <usr13> maybe I just don't remember
[23:18:45] <dive> it drops the terminal down from top of screen
[23:18:52] <macavity> usr13: it lets you bind the terminal application to a key (usually tilde or F12), and when you press that key the terminal drops down over everything else, and when you press it again it swhushes up
[23:18:53] <usr13> Yea, I use xfce too, mostly
[23:18:54] <dive> and closes up there
[23:18:59] <macavity> usr13: like in Quake

[23:20:58] <macavity> in the danish keyboard we have "onehalf", "threquarters" and "section" on the key that is tilde/backtick on the us keyboard.. so its a pretty darn useless key.. might as well have a terminal there
[23:21:41] <macavity> and since i use irssi and a million tabs in my terminal, it really really binds GUI and CLI together nicely
[23:22:03] <macavity> also makes it super fast to check something out in the browser while talking to people on IRC
[23:22:15] <dive> well
[23:22:39] <dive> I have browser on workspace 2, and use alt-left/right to switch workspaces
[23:22:55] <dive> no need to close terminal at all
[23:23:21] <macavity> yeah, that works too

[23:23:41] <macavity> how do you switch terminals if you have 4 open straight in the root window?
[23:23:53] <dive> alt-tab
[23:24:41] <macavity> right, and you keep all gui apps on another workspace, and only have alt-tab cycle current workspace?
[23:24:55] <dive> yeah it cycles current

[23:25:10] <macavity> then it ammounts to about the same, speed wise
[23:25:18] <dive> not really
[23:25:46] <dive> I don't need to alt-tab first
[23:26:02] <macavity> neither do i
[23:26:03] <dive> I just alt-right where chromium is already open
[23:26:19] <macavity> and i press the terminal key.. that is one key less :P
[23:26:35] <dive> or
[23:26:37] <macavity> though, if i alt tab it just retracts
[23:26:46] <dive> if someone puts a link in irc I just ctrl-l
[23:26:58] <dive> and it goes to browser and opens it
[23:27:52] <macavity> i click it, the terminal retracts and the browser opens it
[23:28:21] <dive> I've been weening myself off of mouse
[23:28:28] <dive> spawn of satan
[23:28:38] <macavity> i bet i could set up irssi to open it somehow, but i dont like the idea, that its the last posted link that opens, and not the one i click on
[23:29:03] <macavity> simply because someone might post one just as i hit the shortcut
[23:29:16] <dive> well the perl script that opens links will cycle back through them
[23:29:37] <dive> like ctrl-l twice will go to the before and so on
[23:29:45] <macavity> ah
[23:29:54] <macavity> is that an irssi "plugin"?
[23:30:12] <dive> no it's a perl script for urxvt
[23:30:13] <macavity> or one of you screen hacks?
