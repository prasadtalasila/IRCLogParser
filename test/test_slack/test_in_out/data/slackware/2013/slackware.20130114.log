[00:01:05] <KaMii> macavity: so you used emacs?
[00:01:20] <FriedBob> Doesn't everyone?
[00:01:33] <KaMii> well i do, but i know everyone thinks im dumb for that
[00:01:58] <FriedBob> KaMii: They just jealous cause they can't grok it or aren't beardy enough
[00:02:00] <macavity> no, i just ripped out the elisp core and wrapped it up in a decent userland
[00:02:12] <KaMii> lol
[00:02:18] <adaptr> FriedBob: KaMii will never have the required neckbeard
[00:02:25] <macavity> after all, emacs ecore is the coolest OS kernel in the world.. it just always lacked a decent userland

[00:02:57] <devise> how about emacs :\
[00:04:05] <KaMii> maybe the next OSX release will be OSX Liger

[00:04:14] <KaMii> i know they are going to hybrid something

[00:04:35] <devise> emacs is a text editor
[00:04:44] <devise> why is it brought up so much?
[00:04:44] <KaMii> no, its moar than that
[00:04:56] <devise> ?
[00:05:16] <KaMii> nano is a text editor

[00:06:13] <KaMii> saying emacs is just a text editor is not true

[00:06:54] <KaMii> i cant stand vi
[00:07:02] <devise> i cant stand vi much either
[00:07:04] <adaptr> with which was the first flamewar started - emacs or vi ?
[00:07:12] <macavity> KaMii is right on that.. emacs is a swish army knife
[00:07:17] <KaMii> everytime i try to use it, i endup totally screwing over the file I was trying to edit
[00:07:27] <macavity> adaptr: mailx probably :P
[00:07:33] <MLanden> adaptr: always thought it was X or no X :P
[00:07:36] <FriedBob> Idon't get why a text EDITOR doesn't open a file in edit mode
[00:07:37] <devise> nano is nice
[00:07:40] <xocel> why does no one every bring up nano? :P

[00:34:04] <kullix> hello!
[00:34:08] <devise> hi
[00:34:40] <kullix> question: i have a t400, and windows xp and 7 run fine, but whenever i run slackware kde it runs extremely choppy then clears up after a few minutes, and then is fine
[00:34:48] <kullix> same thing with Fedora kde and gnome
[00:35:39] <KaMii> what gpu is in it?
[00:35:43] <KaMii> or is there one?
[00:36:21] <kullix> intel GM45
[00:36:37] <KaMii> which driver is it using nouveau?
[00:37:10] <kullix> oh i actually dont know. i just blew away that hard drive
[00:37:10] <KaMii> you might need to blacklist nouveau
[00:37:20] <kullix> blacklist? oh ok
[00:37:28] <KaMii> well then why are you in here if you dont have it anymore?
[00:37:47] <kullix> well i want to reinstall it, but i was dying to hear a solution
[00:38:04] <kullix> trust me i love slackware
[00:38:10] <KaMii> im guessing its a driver issue
[00:38:15] <kullix> oh ok
[00:38:20] <KaMii> that or....
[00:38:33] <KaMii> you do know that KDE starts an indexing service
[00:38:57] <kullix> oh i didn't know that, well maybe i did considering on the first desktop load it mentions it, i think
[00:39:00] <macavity> intel gm45 does not use nouveau.. it uses intel
[00:39:18] <KaMii> and it takes a long time for it to finish indexing, so it could just be that service trying to index your hdd, once its done it wont eat up all your resources
[00:39:27] <KaMii> macavity: i didnt think it did, but maybe it was somehow getting loaded
[00:39:37] <macavity> and yes, KDE is getting, uhm, a bit too inteligent :-/
[00:39:51] <KaMii> this is why i like xfce
[00:40:00] <kullix> it doesn't after it sleeps too, which i did read to disable on t400 with kde
[00:40:01] <macavity> KaMii: if it does it will notice that there is no nv hardware and exit
[00:40:07] <KaMii> kullix: my suggestion, try a differet DE and see if you get the same resultes
[00:40:20] <kullix> oh ok
[00:40:24] <macavity> XFCE ftw
[00:40:27] <macavity> really
[00:40:31] <kullix> however, ratpoison works :)
[00:40:53] <KaMii> if you get the same issues in xfce, then its probably some video driver issues and you probably need to just edit your xorg.conf
[00:40:56] <macavity> fluxbox + XFCE for the uber win :P
[00:41:03] <KaMii> lol
[00:41:17] <kullix> yeah maybe i should just use xfce
[00:41:24] <kullix> i dont need a bulky interface :)
[00:41:30] <KaMii> well just try it out as a test
[00:41:46] <KaMii> that or disable nepomuk server and stringi in kde
[00:42:05] <kullix> ohh nice
[00:42:12] <macavity> .. but that cripples so much of KDE that the point goes away
[00:42:17] <kullix> oh
[00:42:19] <KaMii> those two things will bring an i7 quad core to a crawl while its indexing
[00:43:01] <kullix> jeez
[00:43:27] corretico (~luis@190.211.93.38) joined ##slackware.
[00:43:49] <KaMii> but like i said it only does the indexing the very first time kde starts, so once its done, it will have its database built and wont slow you down again
[00:43:59] <macavity> yup.. i think all KDE devs have 4 striped OCZ Vertex 3 MAXIOPS for their home partition
[00:44:07] <KaMii> haha

[02:06:24] <LinuxFireLappi> Seems expensive thou
[02:07:05] <TommyC> franzini_: Check to make sure you're in the right groups. startx from run level 3 will put you into some extra groups as defined by /etc/login.defs.
[02:07:34] <wood_quinn> Logging in will put you in the groups.

[02:13:37] <Soul_keeper> macavity, they said things to me that are just too much, I wouldn't come back there if they begged me

[02:40:43] <Demon_Fox> Someone give me five random words, and I will see if I can remember the next day

[02:41:28] <Demon_Fox> They have logs
[02:41:32] <Demon_Fox> I am not logging this
[02:41:33] <Nova_Man> so do you
[02:41:55] <Demon_Fox> This is xchat and it only saves what I can scroll up to by default

[02:43:00] <Nova_Man> Hmm.. its too much to have the belief that you would not be logging this.... in either log format or paper... thusly this is the same that I cannot have a belief in that there is a god as that would require him to have a log... so basically.... I have no faith in man or god.. and I am going to go and buy a boat.
[02:43:49] <Demon_Fox> I was trying to use a memory method to see how well I can use it
[02:43:49] <Nova_Man> I think I better take my medication :)
[02:43:54] <xocel> preparing for a flood?
[02:44:16] <Nova_Man> If I was preparing for a flood.. I would take my slackware box on the boat :)
[02:44:28] <Nova_Man> and leave my wife behind ;)...
[02:44:54] <Demon_Fox> If I cheat on this test then I won't know how well the memory method works.
[02:45:09] <tsccof> Demon_Fox: my thoughts exactly, why would you cheat?
[02:45:14] <Demon_Fox> I won't
[02:45:21] <Nova_Man> Why wont you ?
[02:45:29] <Demon_Fox> No one here is will to cooperate except with words like:
[02:45:29] <tsccof> Nova_Man: It is pointless if he does
[02:45:37] <Demon_Fox> Go the fuck away ass
[02:45:40] <tsccof> Demon_Fox: I did cooperate
[02:45:46] <Demon_Fox> thanks
[02:46:06] <Demon_Fox> My memory is 50% at best
[02:46:14] <ananke> Demon_Fox: no need to get profane
[02:46:17] <Demon_Fox> Hopefully I can somewhat improve that.
[02:46:28] <Nova_Man> Demon_Fox, hmmm interesting.. you would rather resort to foulness tan realise the statement I used, would be more effcient to remember than 5 words ? interesting
[02:46:32] <Demon_Fox> 50% accurate
[02:46:49] <Nova_Man> would be more effective a use even..
[02:47:05] <Demon_Fox> That is just what people said when I asked for five random words
[02:47:44] <Demon_Fox> Also the test for memory impairment is five random words
[02:48:19] <Nova_Man> 5 random words is nothing more than rote.. if you repeat it over.. however remembering a statement is much more greater a use of the memory.. you use emotion and visualization to remember a statement..
[02:48:52] <Demon_Fox> This method I think is called the peg method or something.
[02:49:06] <Nova_Man> if the test for impairment is 5 random words.. Im screwed ;).. cant event remember 1 random let alone 5.... hmmm or am I referring to women instead of words ;).. no no.. words

[02:52:00] <xocel> to remember lists you should link the values. e.g 0, triggers memory of 1, which triggers memory of 2, and so forth. Generally best achievable by visually linking said values with humor.
[02:52:21] <Demon_Fox> My list of mnemonics are
[02:52:33] <xocel> then all you need to do is remember value 0. and the rest just follows
[02:52:57] <Demon_Fox> Gun, shoe, tree, door, hive, sticks, heaven, gate, line, hen
[02:54:10] <Nova_Man> I never remember anything from the past 2 weeks.. which is wierd cause after around 2 weeks.. I have a near perfect recall.. maybe I need my shortterm mem buffer to dump to long term.. then its accessible.
[02:54:41] <Demon_Fox> I can barely remember faces for more than a couple of seconds
[02:54:49] <Demon_Fox> Though I know a face when I see one
[02:54:58] <tsccof> I can remember faces pretty well
[02:55:13] <Demon_Fox> Worse than that I have more problems with names
[02:55:13] <Nova_Man> Demon.. I rekon I would be similar to you..
[02:55:13] <tsccof> I can remember people I've seen only a few times many years later
[02:55:15] <xocel> faces im good at, very rarely forget a face. But names, i am terrible.
[02:55:38] <Demon_Fox> I can only remember faces when I see them
[02:55:49] <Demon_Fox> I would be idealistic to mug
[02:56:24] <Nova_Man> I remember my first windows 98 key.. and my first office 97 key.. right off the top of my head... blasphemy I know.. but yeah.

[03:19:20] <Nova_Man> well there supposedly is.. but having since been removed from the proxy which operates all that.. and the fact they never changed the default password on the L3 switch I am connected to.. means I do around 50-60gb of traffic each month. :)

[03:41:03] <LinuxFireLappi> I will avoid it for now thanks
[03:42:18] <xocel> lol because pastie is faster for simple pastes. atm anyway. Will be adding pastie/pastebin like functionality to slackpad in the near future. No need to force someone to load a pad, if they could access the info they need from a static page that loads faster :)
[03:42:36] <Jdogzz> Ah, makes sense. Just curious:)
[03:43:44] <xocel> Plus one can only spam so much :P
[03:44:36] <xocel> *cough* http://slackpad.org *cough*
[03:47:12] <xocel> However in situations like "my code is not working, what is wrong?" slackpad is much better. As everyone can be in the same document, making/viewing changes. Instead of pasting back and forth

[04:46:01] <shonudo> wtf?
[04:46:04] <shonudo> seriously?
[04:47:36] <Jdogzz> Yup. Incredibly annoying to manage effectively other than using the webmail interface. And of course you can't use that offline, so Seamonkey it is for now.

[04:48:18] <shonudo> i use kmail (yeah, kde); there's no way my gmail translates into 6x+ size
[04:48:43] <Jdogzz> How much does it say you have stored on Gmail?
[04:50:42] <shonudo> i don't have it broken down that way, but about 300 e-mail messages = 5mb
[04:50:44] <shonudo> fwiw
[04:50:55] <shonudo> and few attachments
[04:51:56] <Jdogzz> I've sent quite a few attachments, which is probably the source of the huge size (then those get duplicated in each folder once downloaded into a mail client).

[04:54:58] <Jdogzz> Mostly songs, but as far as Gmail is concerned that only stacks up to 3.4 GB. When Seamonkey downloads each folder, which Gmail makes as labels referring to the central "All Mail" folder, it downloads the same email for each folder since it doesn't work the way Gmail does.
[04:55:22] <shonudo> use a different client
[04:55:29] <Nova_Man> yeah.. was thinking the same

[04:56:26] <Jdogzz> At least, as far as I know:) I have checked every few months for the past few years.
[04:56:54] <Nova_Man> or just forward all your mail from gmail to somewhere else and create folders there,, that work ;)
[04:57:09] <Skywise> i'm sure theres some option to toggle about that

[05:40:05] <Skywise> yes, i use a steering wheel instead of a mouse
[05:40:19] <shonudo> cause you can't win a race with a mouse
[05:40:25] <shonudo> even a supercharged mouse
[05:40:29] <Skywise> nope
[05:41:32] <Skywise> had a good race today at monza, nearly won from the back of the field in 12th
[05:41:49] <Skywise> i just needed 1 more lap, but it took longer to get thru the pack then i expected
[05:41:52] <shonudo> where did you finish?
[05:41:58] <shonudo> top 3?
[05:42:07] <Skywise> 2nd
[05:42:13] <shonudo> nice
[05:42:23] <shonudo> so you had a shot
[05:42:24] <Skywise> and i was closing in on the leader
[05:42:32] <Skywise> 1 more lap and i would of caught him
[05:42:51] <Skywise> i was 2 secs a lap faster
[05:44:34] <Skywise> i like passing cars more then trying to hold on to the lead
[05:44:37] <Master-Passeli> good morning shonudo and others
[05:44:46] <shonudo> good morning Master-Passeli
[05:44:49] <shonudo> :)
[05:45:33] <Skywise> its technically morning, but until i go to bed, its still night for me
[05:46:04] <shonudo> i think that's the rule; it's night for someone until they call it a night
[05:46:15] <shonudo> which makes me wonder about keith richards...
[05:46:45] <Skywise> he just falls asleep where he is and lays there until its time to get up
[05:47:04] <Skywise> i don't know why he bothers to pay for a bed when he sleeps on the floor
[05:47:10] <shonudo> different shit, same day
[05:47:30] <Skywise> yeah, he handles it well, i think i'd get tired of waking up that what
[05:47:39] <Skywise> s/what/way
[05:48:17] <Skywise> but he's outlived all his critics
[05:48:25] <shonudo> he's outlived himself

[05:51:30] <shonudo> indeed
[05:51:50] <wood_quinn> I'm a fuckin' rock star.
[05:52:03] <shonudo> some people look to rock stars as heroes; rock stars look to keith richards
[05:52:24] <Skywise> you mean a star on the rock molesting circuit
[05:52:41] <wood_quinn> Hey, those rocks were well past the age of consent, man.
[05:53:14] <Skywise> they may be millions of years old, but they were still naive

[05:54:19] <Skywise> the civil case won't be so easy to dodge

[06:00:17] <Skywise> don't like having to share your computer eh?
[06:00:33] <Jdogzz> What do you mean?
[06:01:07] <Skywise> that emacs takes control
[06:01:07] <wood_quinn> emacs, is the best path, ever built.
[06:01:28] <shonudo> i can't believe we're not in the middle of a flame war by now
[06:01:51] <Jdogzz> Ah, I don't mind emacs taking control if it would be a little more conducive to helping me out:)
[06:01:53] <shonudo> i'm making popcorn anyway
[06:01:59] <wood_quinn> shonudo: GOsh you'RE SO duMB
[06:02:06] <shonudo> i know!
[06:02:08] <wood_quinn> You're wrong because your mom is dumbber
[06:02:08] <shonudo> lol
[06:02:10] <Skywise> when you find yourself strangely typing line after line of code you don't even understand, then emacs will have taken full control
[06:02:36] <Jdogzz> I'm halfway there, I'm typing line after line of code I don't understand but it's from random blog posts, not emacs:)
[06:02:44] <Skywise> so you think
[06:02:50] <wood_quinn> Speaking of blogs, I should start one.
[06:02:53] <Skywise> emacs planted that line some time ago
[06:02:53] <shonudo> those are emacs generated blogs
[06:03:03] <Jdogzz> True, emacs might be working behind the scenes to manipulate my every move.
[06:03:05] <wood_quinn> I need more space to not put my thoughts.
[06:03:19] <shonudo> wood_quinn, dont
[06:03:26] <shonudo> don't*
[06:03:31] <Skywise> yeah, theres no mystery as to how emacs works
[06:03:41] <Skywise> we all know it wants world domination
[06:03:53] <shonudo> universe domination
[06:03:57] <Skywise> that too
[06:03:59] <Jdogzz> If it wants world domination, why doesn't it have better documentation about it?
[06:04:08] <shonudo> because it's a secret
[06:04:20] <Skywise> its got plenty of documentation, you're just not allowed access to it
[06:04:24] <wood_quinn> It's actually two secrets.
[06:04:30] <wood_quinn> shonudo is wrong wrong wrong
[06:04:38] <Jdogzz> What's the second secret?
[06:04:42] <Skywise> you're not supposed to mention that other secret
[06:04:43] <wood_quinn> <puts fingers in ears><yells nanananana>
[06:04:45] <Skywise> cause its secret
[06:04:55] <wood_quinn> wrong wrong wrong
[06:05:09] <shonudo> if you know how to find emacs documentation, you don't need emacs documentation
[06:05:09] <Skywise> its never gonna stay secret like this
[06:05:28] <wood_quinn> Speaking of documentation.
[06:05:30] <Jdogzz> Can't emacs take over my mind and do this for me?

[06:05:49] <Jdogzz> I explicitly typed it out into a buffer so it knows it has my consent.
[06:05:53] <Skywise> you have to type all the letters in documentation at once with shift-ctrl
[06:07:04] <Kemical_> quick question, I gotta stupid assignment to do, lab at school that is used by TA's has ubuntu running, is the /proc filesystem the same structure on slackware and ubuntu?
[06:07:40] <Skywise> proc is a virtual fs made by the kernel
[06:07:53] <wood_quinn> If I'm correct, just speaking out my bum, it's going to be the same if you're using the same kernel.
[06:07:57] <shonudo> kernels outrank TAs
[06:08:08] <wood_quinn> Or at least if you haven't made extreme changes.

[06:11:02] <Kemical_> dont know, let me correct, it actually runs inside VB on a macos
[06:11:17] <shonudo> what's a "macos"?
[06:11:26] <wood_quinn> Finished a Pepsi a while ago.
[06:11:31] <shonudo> mac OS?
[06:11:36] <Skywise> why is everyone running in a vm
[06:11:36] <wood_quinn> VirualBox
[06:11:53] <shonudo> no kidding; vm craze
[06:11:55] <Skywise> its like hardware is just so old school
[06:12:05] <wood_quinn> I was running 14.0 in a VM, but I wouldn't want to actually use it from the VM.
[06:12:06] <Kemical_> I guess computer labs have to serve many uses

[06:12:40] <Skywise> i still need to figure out a backup system
[06:12:42] <wood_quinn> Nothing yet, but I want to use a Unicode console, among other things.
[06:13:07] <Kemical_> but just for programming use a bunch of old pentiums is all we'd need, sprinkle a bit of Slackware and it would be just fine, :)
[06:13:17] <Skywise> being able to fire off an instance in a vm  sounds cool
[06:13:38] <wood_quinn> I miss having a CPU with hardware virtualization extensions..

[06:14:35] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[06:14:35] <Skywise> i miss having a cpu that doesn't need a nuclear cooling tower to keep from melting
[06:14:44] <wood_quinn> They're both optional components at least.
[06:14:57] <Skywise> they're all on their own disksets so they have to be installed
[06:15:29] <wood_quinn> "s/have/don't have/"

[06:18:52] <TommyC> Generally people use the file manager that's given with the DE/WM since that's what is supported with that DE/WM.
[06:18:54] <wood_quinn> I use Ctrl+O
[06:19:07] <shonudo> i'm guessing most people who don't use kde don't use dolphin
[06:19:10] <shonudo> just a guess
[06:19:18] <Skywise> can't you use konquerer to view directories too
[06:19:19] <Jdogzz> What about people who use Fluxbox?
[06:19:38] <Jdogzz> That doesn't come with a file manager as far as I know.

[07:36:46] <wood_quinn> If you're working with text files, perl is a good idea. If you want something you can write quickly bash might be good for that. JavaScript has recently become a good language to write network daemons in.

[08:02:59] <KaMii> it should be called fugly (something that starts with v) window manager
[08:03:15] <ruskie> lol
[08:03:21] <ruskie> v is virtual
[08:03:25] <ruskie> wm is window manager
[08:03:58] <ruskie> f is mostly unknown but some claim feline
[08:04:10] <KaMii> it probably means fucking
[08:04:21] <KaMii> because while coding they kept saying, fucking this and fucking that all the time
[08:04:25] <ruskie> ll
[08:04:26] <ruskie> lol

[08:06:22] <ruskie> because tilling wm's from my perspective are crap
[08:06:26] <KaMii> idk, it just looks fugly imo
[08:06:49] <KaMii> yea i tried i3wm and the tiling thing kept fighting me
[08:07:33] <KaMii> one month until singles awareness day
[08:08:00] <wood_quinn> Is that a real thing?
[08:08:10] <KaMii> of course
[08:08:21] <KaMii> valentines day = singles awareness day
[08:08:31] <wood_quinn> Oh lol.
[08:08:47] <ruskie> I simply don't like tilling WM's... I already have my fvwm config doing mostly that... though I like floating windows as well so yeah...
[08:09:15] <wood_quinn> i3 can do floating windows.
[08:09:30] <KaMii> how?
[08:09:47] <wood_quinn> Modifier+Shift+Space
[08:09:57] nicebikes (~bikes@24-179-80-50.dhcp.jcsn.tn.charter.com) joined ##slackware.
[08:10:00] <KaMii> thats not really floating
[08:10:06] <KaMii> its more, moving the tile to another location
[08:10:14] <wood_quinn> No, it's floating.
[08:10:36] <KaMii> does i3 even support a mouse?
[08:10:38] <KaMii> i forgot
[08:10:42] <wood_quinn> Modifier+Shift+Arrows is move.
[08:10:44] <wood_quinn> Yes.
[08:10:57] <wood_quinn> It uses mouse focus by default, and you can use the mouse to resize tiles.
[08:11:08] <wood_quinn> Or to move/resize floating windows.
[08:11:10] <KaMii> only if its a serial mouse, lmfao
[08:11:14] <KaMii> jk
[08:11:28] <wood_quinn> Also the scroll wheel over the bottom bar will cycle through workspaces.
[08:11:31] <ruskie> so basically I gain nothing by switching

[08:26:22] <anunnaki> i like how everything is packages

[08:27:08] <doug713705> ni click
[08:27:12] <doug713705> no clicks*
[08:27:22] <Master-Passeli> slackware does not have clickable install guis
[08:27:39] <Master-Passeli> text based menu install system
[08:27:52] <anunnaki> ok so is it like a install command and just type in a kernel package
[08:28:11] <Master-Passeli> kernel is nothing special there
[08:28:20] <Master-Passeli> just like any other package
[08:28:28] <anunnaki> oh ok
[08:28:28] <doug713705> insert the slackware install CD, boot on it, press enter at first choice then when booted just type setup.

[08:29:49] <Master-Passeli> can't say, never used arch
[08:29:52] <anunnaki> but slack gives you the option of installing a bloated version instead of your own custom?
[08:30:08] <anunnaki> i mean bloated and or custom
[08:30:14] <Master-Passeli> slackware is all but bloated
[08:30:27] Kemical_ (~chris@d207-6-144-169.bchsia.telus.net) left irc: Quit: leaving
[08:30:45] <anunnaki> my bad.. i should choose my wording better
[08:31:13] <doug713705> you can install precisely what you want or install some prepared sets of packages or a full install.
[08:31:15] <anunnaki> i meant more to say.. a auto install with basic packages installe
[08:31:42] <doug713705> for a new comer, full install is recomended
[08:31:58] <anunnaki> i like the whole custom idea better. seems more challenging and time consuming but worth the pay off
[08:32:19] <doug713705> in fact, i can suggest a full install then remove packages that you don't need/want
[08:32:20] <Master-Passeli> anunnaki: http://docs.slackware.com/slackware:install   << from there you can check what does it looks like
[08:32:44] <TommyC> If you do remove packages, I highly recommend using: removepkg | tee removepkg.log
[08:33:04] <TommyC> Or whatever you want the log file to be named, as some directories (and files in those directories) aren't removed sometimes depending on the circumstance.
[08:33:25] <TommyC> If you log it, you'll be able to see which directories weren't removed, as removepkg will give a Warning.
[08:34:21] <doug713705> good idea
[08:34:40] <TommyC> ghostscript and ghostscript-fonts-something is one of those peculiar situations.
[08:35:30] <TommyC> Both use /usr/share/ghostscript, so if you try to remove ghostscript, ghostscript will give a warning about new files being in /usr/share/ghostscript so it won't remove those files because it's not a part of the package, and assumes the system administrator put new files in there when in actuality they're a part of the ghostscript-fonts package.
[08:35:43] <TommyC> Vice versa with the ghostscript-fonts package.

[08:46:26] <ikla> KaMii, to me it is

[08:46:45] <KaMii> what in slackware is hogging your resources?

[08:46:56] <KaMii> do you have a 5gb hdd?
[08:46:58] <ikla> KaMii, to you maybe
[08:47:11] <ikla> KaMii, I just don't like useless packages on my system

[08:47:31] <KaMii> its 2013 and people bitch about a free and open OS that takes up less space than microsoft
[08:47:42] <aceofspades19> ikla: what packages to you are useless?
[08:47:47] <ikla> KaMii, Microsoft has nothing to do with this
[08:47:48] <wood_quinn> LFS makes a lot more sense if you don't want a single package you don't need to be installed.

[10:06:15] <fiveofoh1> In particular right now I'm trying to build lxml and getting this error http://stackoverflow.com/questions/648482/a-trivial-python-swig-error-question

[10:06:57] Nick change: fiveofoh1 -> fiveofoh
[10:08:00] <fiveofoh> Is there some kind of config I need to set up to compile 64-bit things after enabling multilib?  Since it says it defaults to compiling 32-bit, and seems to be doing so

[10:11:32] aborazmeh (~aborazmeh@unaffiliated/aborazmeh) joined ##slackware.
[10:11:41] <KaMii> it doesnt default to 32 bit, it will only compile 32 bit if you set your shell to 32 bit as alienbob's wiki explains
[10:12:03] <KaMii> perhaps you were in a 32 bit shell, forgot then tried to compile a 64 bit package?

[10:18:38] <fiveofoh> Aye, looks like that was my problem
[10:18:42] <fiveofoh> Apologies for my stupidity
[10:18:47] <KaMii> np
[10:18:52] <fiveofoh> And thanks for making me do a closer re-read
[10:19:19] <fiveofoh> That does seem like and odd way to do that script - putting it in /etc/profile.d with no execute permissions?
[10:19:34] <fiveofoh> Or is that a standard thing for optional profile.d sections?
[10:19:47] <fiveofoh> Okay, lxml is happy now
[10:20:18] <fiveofoh> I figured there was something I'd screwed up on the config level
[10:20:23] <KaMii> well, its where alienbob wanted it, probably because its so foreign to slackware, he thought that be a good place for it
[10:22:43] <fiveofoh> It does make sense in a way.  I just was looking at unrelated profile.d stuff and thought "weird, this one isn't executable...better fix that while I'm at it"
[10:22:55] <fiveofoh> That'll teach me to fix things that ain't broke
[10:23:26] <KaMii> yea, dont make it executable
[10:24:05] <fiveofoh> Yep, I un-made it executable and everything is going much more smoothly
[10:24:22] <KaMii> lol

[14:45:26] <Cultist> So I have my media player looking in a certain directory on an external USB drive for my music
[14:45:39] <Cultist> but the directory it looks in is just a symlink to a different usb drive.
[14:46:19] <Cultist> would the drive with the symlink on it still be in constant use in the same way as if the music were directly on it?
[14:46:41] <Cultist> specifically worried about killing it's usb port through overuse
[14:46:42] <BrokenCog> you won't be able to umount it if that is the question.
[14:46:48] <BrokenCog> ah.
[14:47:00] <BrokenCog> is that still possible??
[14:47:07] <Cultist> dunno
[14:47:17] <BrokenCog> let me know in a couple months :).
[14:47:49] <Cultist> I should make a huge circle of symlinks each linking to each other
[14:47:58] <Cultist> with like the 50th symlink actually hitting the real directory
[14:48:51] <Cultist> or with it linking back to the first symlink
[14:49:07] <Cultist> could be the basis of a modern Kafka novel
[14:50:25] <ananke> not sure what you mean by 'killing its usb port through overuse'
[14:51:01] <ananke> the symlink is going to point to the other filesystem, so nothing more will be accessed from the first drive. HOWEVER, you will be waking up that drive for no good reason
[14:51:09] jstg (~jstg@c-71-59-169-54.hsd1.wa.comcast.net) joined ##slackware.
[14:51:10] <Cultist> I've heard constant usage of a usb-powered device can cause damage.
[14:51:18] <Cultist> purely anecdotal of course, I've never acutally seen it
[14:51:31] <ananke> Cultist: sounds like an urban legend
[14:51:40] <Cultist> possibly
[14:51:50] <ananke> of course, the best course of action would be to eliminate the need for the first drive
[14:51:59] <Cultist> I'll do that eventually
[14:52:07] <ananke> and simply configure your media player to look on the second drive directly
[14:52:14] <Cultist> I'd have to delete my database then spend 20 minutes rescanning the real directory
[14:52:17] <Cultist> kinda a pain
[14:52:34] <BrokenCog> actually, USB will auto-shut down if the amperage exceeds 500ma, however I think some vendors had bugs which didn't and would burn out ... but I never actually saw it myself.
[14:52:42] <ananke> you'd have to spend 20 minutes of actual effort, or would it simply take 20 minutes for your computer to do it?
[14:53:01] <shonudo> http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21013087
[14:53:04] <Cultist> well there'd be a 20 minute gap in which my music player would not be running
[14:53:15] <Cultist> so I'd have to time it to perfectly coincide with me being away from my computer for 20 minutes.
[14:53:16] <ananke> Cultist: do it before you go somewhere. duh

[15:27:51] <delt0r> Having problems installing slack 14 64 bit on my old laptop
[15:28:31] <delt0r> i get everything up to install full... then after about 5 secs it jumps to System is now configured and ready to restart
[15:28:42] <delt0r> its pretty clear that nothing has been installed
[15:28:55] <delt0r> there are no error msg as far as i can tell (ie dmesh)
[15:28:58] <delt0r> dmesg
[15:28:58] <hiptobecubic> BogdanR, why not?
[15:29:36] <delt0r> Is there some install log somewhere? Been using slack since 1996 and i have never had a install issue before
[15:30:01] <BogdanR> hiptobecubic: IDK. I just wanted to know if you have a good reason to use it :)
[15:30:01] <smed> since 1996 and you do not know where the install log is located?
[15:30:14] <smed> did you try /var/log
[15:31:42] <delt0r> smed: i have never needed to care about the install... as its always been flawless before this time
[15:31:59] soypirate (~soypirate@75.94.81.12) joined ##slackware.
[15:32:27] <smed> well at the very last step, during the installation, before it starts copying over files, the ncurses dialog tells you where it's going to drop the install log.
[15:32:40] <delt0r> but no... i don't find anything usefull under /var/log
[15:32:41] <smed> and TBH, I dont recall where that is either....but it can't be too hard to find.
[15:32:46] <smed> try /root
[15:33:24] <smed> I actually have ZERO slackware boxen right now, or I would confirm that for you
[15:34:10] <smed> and tbh, I've only had to go back and review that log once or twice mysefl.
[15:34:20] <delt0r> I can't even find anything with find
[15:35:30] <smed> try /var/log/packages to see if there were any errors installing packages...
[15:35:42] <smed> obviously you want to check those packages you are currently having trouble with
[15:36:03] <delt0r> It doesn't install any package at all
[15:36:18] <delt0r> it jumps from about to install... to finsihed.
[15:36:30] <delt0r> i expect a issue with the source.

[15:36:49] <delt0r> no...
[15:36:55] <smed> k - problem with the source.
[15:36:56] <ananke> delt0r: did you go through any package selection?
[15:37:14] <smed> I'm guessing he selected a full-installation
[15:37:19] <delt0r> I used the full install option.
[15:37:21] <delt0r> yea
[15:37:26] <ananke> i'd suggest visiting maybe custom/expert installation, see if any package selection appears
[15:37:38] <delt0r> hmmm.. will try that
[15:37:42] <smed> try installing just a base system to start with...that should help you narrow things down and uncover any problems with the source.

[21:11:42] <TheM4ch1n3> Jdogzz: that ubuntu s*x

[23:28:57] kaleun (~kaleun@131.94.186.20) joined ##slackware.
[23:29:34] <hpg> how can I set limits under Slackware 14 (I want to prevent forkbombs ...)
[23:31:46] <kaleun> http://slackwiki.com/Resource_Limits
[23:32:13] <hpg> thank you! :)
[23:33:10] <kaleun> I think that you might be able to use that info to set it up.
[23:33:24] <kaleun> I remember there being something more specific on the wiki, but I can't find it now.
[23:33:40] <kaleun> Either way, if you take a look around on there you should find enough info to get you set up.
[23:33:45] <kaleun> Damn forkbombs.

[23:39:34] <hpg> max user processes              (-u) 30516 <-- that's the default - IMO too much!

[23:45:02] <wood_quinn> You do realize ulimit also defines how many files someone can have open, right?
[23:45:12] <wood_quinn> And that network sockets are files?

[23:46:25] <hpg> yes
[23:47:52] <hpg> I only modify "max user processes" (ulimit -u)
[23:48:42] <hpg> forkbombs open processes, not files ;)
[23:49:33] <wood_quinn> Just didn't want you setting ulimit to "2" or something like that lol.
