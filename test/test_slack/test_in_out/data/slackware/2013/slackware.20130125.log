[02:14:42] <BrokenCog> if you run it in an xterm type, the bindings will work. if you are on the console, then you will need to use the console key mapping

[03:30:36] <shonudo> np
[03:30:37] <TommyC> Hey*
[03:30:44] <shonudo> how are things in U hell?
[03:31:09] <shonudo> did the school improve its network?
[03:31:41] <TommyC> well, I don't know
[03:31:44] <TommyC> but let's find out. :D
[03:32:04] <shonudo> hope it's better than last semester
[03:32:07] <TommyC> yeah
[03:32:10] <TommyC> constant disconnects, ugh...
[03:32:33] <TommyC> and this year, I have a bet with my friend. If I only use free software to do my homework and assignments, I get $100. :)
[03:32:42] <TommyC> I'm finding it quite difficult to use calligra to be honest.
[03:32:43] <Jdogzz> I like that bet:)
[03:32:49] <shonudo> heh, that should be an easy ace
[03:32:54] <shonudo> you should have bet more
[03:32:56] <Jdogzz> Why not LibreOffice?
[03:33:14] <TommyC> eh, calligra comes with Slackware 14.0 so I was like "why not"
[03:33:14] <pi31415> i ran into 1 too many LO bugs
[03:33:29] <shonudo> setup libreoffice, TommyC
[03:33:33] <shonudo> you'll be set
[03:33:35] <TommyC> plus it's easier to download the package and install it in contrast to compiling LO from source
[03:33:41] <Jdogzz> How are you dealing with the lack of exporting as docx?
[03:33:47] <TommyC> I export as .doc
[03:33:48] <TommyC> hehe
[03:33:53] <shonudo> ^^
[03:34:01] <shonudo> to begin with, that's the sane choice
[03:34:08] <shonudo> but i can export as docx on LO
[03:34:24] <shonudo> docx is bs
[03:34:27] <shonudo> or bsx
[03:34:30] <shonudo> or whatever
[03:34:32] <Jdogzz> lol
[03:34:35] <TommyC> and since I can edit file extensions, I've even done random crap like: dd if=/dev/urandom of=someassignment.docx and e-mailing it to the teacher
[03:34:44] <TommyC> then the teacher's like "oh it didn't open, I'll give you another day to work on it"
[03:34:47] <TommyC> :)
[03:35:12] <TommyC> I also do that to turn in assignments "early" (they're not really assignments, just random crap)
[03:35:12] <Jdogzz> Nice one, I did that for a scholarship.
[03:35:29] <TommyC> err, not assignments
[03:35:34] <TommyC> I mean early turn-ins
[03:35:37] Action: BrokenCog learns how the youth of tommorow social engineer their way to the top.
[03:36:04] <TommyC> like "Hi professor, I just wanted to get my essay read and edited 3 weeks ahead of time before I turn it in to you."
[03:36:16] <TommyC> <send some random file ending in .docx that doesn't work>

[03:36:53] <TommyC> just have to gain favor early in the year, after that you can BS just about every assignment they throw at you
[03:37:22] <TommyC> s/year/semester/
[03:37:39] <BrokenCog> saves from having to use the ass-licking route later in the semester.
[03:39:59] <Jdogzz> Seems like a lot of schools are moving to a more controlled system, like submitting assignments through a website that you can directly edit text with.
[03:40:25] <TommyC> our schools haven't used that yet (thank goodness)
[03:40:32] <TommyC> btw, what was up with that "owo" stuff earlier? O_o

[03:59:58] <BrokenCog> oh you mean about the UPS ... it has two computers, two monitors , couple switches/dsl modem .. and some other things plugged in it.
[04:00:48] <n1x4> How many watts?

[04:06:02] <n1x4> I need the PSU you have :P
[04:06:20] <BrokenCog> yeah, I got tired of that ... bought this UPS, i think it's 750.
[04:07:03] <n1x4> Nice.... what brand?
[04:07:48] <BrokenCog> from Bestbuy ... nothing unusual ... can't see the label - it's behind the desk.
[04:08:32] <shonudo> is it their home brand?
[04:08:51] <n1x4> Right on.... That's definitely one of the things on my toget list, I've always had good luck with Antec but as of late I just dunno about them.
[04:09:26] <BrokenCog> I think that's what this is ... that sounds familiar.
[04:09:30] <shonudo> i've never been that impressed with antec GPUs... a bit pricey and no  better than the competition
[04:10:24] <n1x4> I was referring to PSU, never had any cpu/gpu from Antec..
[04:10:42] <shonudo> typo: my bad, i meant PSU
[04:10:54] <n1x4> But I'd say they're going down hill if it's like their damned PSU's
[04:11:02] <shonudo> antec doesn't make GPUs
[04:11:04] <n1x4> ^^
[04:11:21] <n1x4> Ahh, cooling solutions.. my bad
[04:12:14] <n1x4> What are some decent brands out now (PSU wise).
[04:13:42] <n1x4> Seems all the 'good ole brands' have went down-hill..
[04:13:53] <shonudo> i have a feeling most of the PSUs out there are made in china and rebranded
[04:13:57] <shonudo> so, no advice
[04:14:07] <n1x4> Meh, i hear ya
[04:14:08] <shonudo> best price, best specs, if that's advice
[04:14:12] <n1x4> lul
[04:14:15] <n1x4> lol
[04:16:11] <n1x4> Well, dunno about that... Picked up a 650w not too long for 45$, great specs.. Got it home and pulled it out of the box, weighed next to nothing, the box and padding weighed more.. Plugged it into this old dell here with a geforce 430 and 60w cpu... ZAP
[04:16:47] <shonudo> no warranty?
[04:17:48] <n1x4> Nope... Bought it off some PC repair lackey in town.. He just opened up and I stopped in..
[04:18:32] <shonudo> even the crappiest new stuff online comes with some warranty
[04:18:33] <n1x4> It still works, just not enough to power an old POS pc.. I have it running a  TEC on my server right now ^^
[04:18:39] <n1x4> Indeed
[04:19:11] <shonudo> you can always check newegg and read the reviews
[04:19:35] <n1x4> That's where I get all my stuff now... Love the reveiws!
[04:19:42] <shonudo> useful
[04:19:46] <n1x4> VERY
[04:20:19] <shonudo> and you can spot the goofballs a mile away... "i purchased this PSU and hooked it up to my toaster, and it didn't work. worse, it burnt the bread"
[04:20:48] <shonudo> "didn't work" and "burnt the bread"? that's one massive PSU f'up
[04:20:53] <n1x4> HaHa
[04:22:29] <wood_quinn> shonudo: Well obviously. The thing should work, if I can plug it into the wall.
[04:22:47] <n1x4> It does kind of freak me out a little though, seems EVERY item has at least a few reviews that were DOA.. Luckily none so far.
[04:23:08] <wood_quinn> I usually ignore DOA arrivals.
[04:23:31] <wood_quinn> Unless the company has a history of not dealing with them or there are more DOAs than live shipments.
[04:24:03] <shonudo> i'd ignore DOAs for the same reason wood_quinn just mentioned
[04:24:04] <n1x4> True but I have some pretty jacked up luck.
[04:24:19] <shonudo> every manufacturer is going to ship the occasional doa
[04:24:44] <n1x4> Of course and I totally get that, guess I'm just a little impatient ehn it comes to new h/w
[04:25:00] <n1x4> Anticipatory :P
[04:25:28] <shonudo> there are manufacturers/retailers that deal with that in a way that will make you a customer for life; asus and logitec come to mind

[07:49:40] <ventYl> despite that every working computer i have is equipped with firewire i've never used it

[08:05:32] <KaMii> then I can domesticate some dolphins and start a dolpin assisted pregrancy service

[08:05:56] <Skywise> if only

[08:06:27] <Skywise> yeah, i think thats how it works
[08:06:36] <KaMii> no, i mean the dolphins will assist human women to give birth
[08:06:59] <Skywise> what do they use for hands?
[08:07:16] <KaMii> they dont, they use their sonar
[08:07:22] <Skywise> and then what
[08:07:36] <KaMii> idk, i saw some hippie show on tv where this girl was thinking about letting dolphins help her give birth
[08:07:48] <Skywise> yeah, she prolly didn't think it all the way thru
[08:08:28] <KaMii> this one lady claimed to be an 'expert' on dolphins giving birth... but when the lady asked how many times this happed, she said, 'well, none yet, but dolphins know what they are doing'  the lady decided to have her baby at a hospital
[08:08:29] <Skywise> like maybe she should let the dolphins ask to be midwives first
[08:08:54] <Skywise> i'm sure they know what they're doing with dolphins
[08:09:10] <KaMii> but that preggers hippie almost let the dolphins try
[08:09:27] <Skywise> yeah, she'd prolly end up killing the baby and herself
[08:09:38] <KaMii> or the dolphins would eat the baby
[08:09:47] meisteris (~meisteris@omgema.lt) joined ##slackware.
[08:09:50] <KaMii> or it would drownd
[08:10:01] <Skywise> yeah, it would certainly be far from help
[08:10:26] <KaMii> but see thats the best part, since its the dolphins doing the birth, you can only sue the dolphins, so.. its a win win situation
[08:10:36] <Skywise> but unless a dolphin can give an epidural, i'm not sure how it can help
[08:11:01] <KaMii> thats why they have the sonar.... it takes the pain away
[08:11:10] <Skywise> is there even a dolphin signal for breech birth or anything
[08:11:46] <Skywise> if sonar took pain away, we'd each have one in our bathroom
[08:11:46] <KaMii> of course, it sounds like this:  click click click  oh shit click click click, then it swims off
[08:12:07] <KaMii> Skywise: thats the best part, hippies believe anything you tell them

[08:12:25] <KaMii> just say its natural and organic and they will bend over backwards for it
[08:12:46] <Skywise> the dolphin would more likely be, this dumb human is about to give birth and is trying to swim, get her out of here
[08:13:07] <KaMii> yea, poor dolphin doesnt want to swim in placenta water
[08:13:18] <KaMii> and im sure that just attracts sharks
[08:13:24] <KaMii> but you dont tell the hippies this
[08:13:39] <Skywise> the sharks are good at c-sections
[08:13:45] <KaMii> hahaha
[08:14:43] <slacktivist> "Most placental mammals participate in placentophagy..."
[08:14:49] <slacktivist> i don't think the dolphins would mind at all
[08:15:07] <KaMii> yea, see
[08:15:18] <KaMii> my business will be HUGE
[08:15:27] <Skywise> fattest dolphins around
[08:15:43] <KaMii> first i get the mothers to drink a lot of my whale milk then they have natural births at sea with dolphins
[08:15:48] <KaMii> what could possibly go wrong?
[08:15:54] <ventYl> sharks?
[08:16:03] <KaMii> its part of nature
[08:16:05] <Skywise> killer whales learn about your operation
[08:16:06] <KaMii> so its natural
[08:16:13] <KaMii> more milk
[08:16:14] <Skywise> they'd eat everyone
[08:16:23] <KaMii> im ok with them eating hippies
[08:16:32] <Skywise> try and stop 'em
[08:16:34] <KaMii> again, its a win win situation for me

[08:24:30] <Skywise> it doesn't matter what you call it, whoever is gonna use it is prolly gonna get killed anyway

[08:32:54] <KaMii> it jsut said its full of so much rich fat its like toothpaste
[08:33:11] <KaMii> taste better than your mint toothpaste!
[08:33:40] <Skywise> the mint is for covering up the bad taste
[08:35:00] <KaMii> i hate the mint
[08:35:18] <fuzzix> Can't you get other flavours?
[08:35:32] <fuzzix> Children's toothpaste is less intense, I would imagine.
[08:35:43] <rachael> toothpaste today comes from the success crossbreeding of dogs and tubes of toothpaste, it has really lowered the cost of the production
[08:36:06] <Skywise> they used to offer cinnamon, but everything is pretty much some kind of mint now
[08:36:21] <fuzzix> Ugh, would rather the mint
[08:36:26] <KaMii> its all mint and i hate it

[08:44:18] <KaMii> i think brushing your teeth with a good brandy might do a great job
[08:44:26] <Urchlay> it has the added benefit that, if the first thing you do in the morning is brush your teeth with crappy blended whiskey, nothing that happens for the rest of the day can bother you :)

[08:46:23] <fuzzix> No, Black Bush is decent enough inexpensive stuff, but I think Bushmills is just rough. The 10 is rough too. 16 is OK.
[08:46:56] <Zosma> Bushmills is the only Irish malt whiskey yes.
[08:47:16] <Urchlay> it's irish whiskey, inherently rougher than scotch maybe? (I dunno if I've ever had any other irish to compare it to)
[08:47:29] <Zosma> Not inherently, irish whiskeys are usually smooth blends.
[08:47:36] <Zosma> But Bushmills is the exception to the rule.

[08:50:16] <Urchlay> on my budget, I barely get to drink anything. Pretty much only if someone buys me a drink, has been the rule lately
[08:50:33] <Zosma> Urchlay: for Scotch whiskys, a whisky with a very good quality/price ratio is Grants. And if you want a really good one, try Bunnahabhain.
[08:50:48] <fuzzix> Urchlay: Well, next time they're offering get a Midleton Very Rare - overpriced, overhyped but if they're buying...
[08:50:57] <Urchlay> (which is kinda like those guys who say they're quitting smoking, so can they please bum one of my cigs? really it means they've quit buying them...)

[09:00:19] <KaMii> so, i figure it might be a good one
[09:01:38] <Urchlay> sounds kinda goofy
[09:01:51] <KaMii> yea, i like goofy ones
[09:02:02] <KaMii> that way i know i cant get disappointed
[09:02:45] <Urchlay> that one movie you recommended wasn't too goofy
[09:02:54] <KaMii> which one was that?
[09:02:56] <Urchlay> (in german w/subtitles I think)
[09:03:01] <KaMii> cargo
[09:03:04] <Urchlay> yeah, that
[09:03:04] <KaMii> yea, i love that movie
[09:03:08] <Urchlay> I didn't think it sucked
[09:03:28] <KaMii> but its a foreign movie, so i give them more trust than hollywood
[09:03:40] <KaMii> Urchlay: did you get tood subtitles?  my subtitles I had were kinda sucky
[09:04:05] <KaMii> they were thying to translate the swearing and it would say, this is a fuck, and stuff like that, it was really funny
[09:04:38] <Urchlay> can't remember. Which means it probably wasn't bad enough to be funny
[09:05:02] <KaMii> oh, the translation i have is just really funny, the sentence structure and grammar is horrible
[09:05:40] <Urchlay> worst subtitles I've seen lately: chinese pirated release of a japanese anime, with original soundtrack & engrish subtitles written by chinese people (who don't seem to speak either english or japanese well)
[09:06:28] <KaMii> lol, worse one I saw was a chineses cam copy of the Italian Job dubbed in chinese with english subtitles... none of the movie made sense
[09:06:45] <Urchlay> on the screen you see a picture of an asteroid. In the soundtrack, you hear the word "asteroidoru" or something like that (recognizable even to me), in the subtitles they're called "minor planets"
[09:06:54] <KaMii> when they were trying to open the safe the subtitles said, 'we need a sailing technition'
[09:07:13] <KaMii> hahaha
[09:07:16] <KaMii> minor plantes
[09:08:01] <KaMii> oh, i was wrong this movie was about a mission to mars, not the moon
[09:08:09] <Urchlay> probably the chinese word for asteroid literally means "minor planet"... our word comes from greek and means something like "wandering star" so it's at least a plausible theory
[09:08:23] <KaMii> yea
[09:08:32] <KaMii> but there is asteroid, meteor, and meteorite
[09:08:40] nullby7e (~null@unaffiliated/nullby7e) joined ##slackware.
[09:08:53] <Urchlay> (actually maybe "asteroid" means "not starlike", the a- prefix might mean not, like in amoral or asocial)
[09:09:12] <KaMii> agnostic
[09:09:33] <ventYl> if there's meteor and meteorite, is there also asteor?
[09:09:42] <Urchlay> apparently not
[09:10:08] <KaMii> i think asteroid doesnt come into contact with earth, metor is before it enters earths atmosphere and meteroite is after its entered
[09:10:12] <Urchlay> meteor becomes a meteorite once it hits the ground, is the difference I think
[09:10:28] <KaMii> i think its atmosphere not the ground
[09:10:39] <Urchlay> probably
[09:10:45] <ventYl> i also thing that's the ground
[09:10:54] <Urchlay> and then you have "meteorology" which has nothing to do with either
[09:11:04] <KaMii> well usually if it enters the atmosphere it wont escape, it will either hit or burn up
[09:11:11] <ventYl> meteor explodes in atmosphere and burns completely, meteoride crashes into ground
[09:11:24] <KaMii> aha
[09:11:31] <Urchlay> if you're lucky, it's the ground
[09:11:36] <Urchlay> and not, say, your house or your car
[09:11:41] <KaMii> dont get hit with it
[09:11:47] <KaMii> might hurt like hell
[09:12:01] <Urchlay> you'd probably never even feel it if it killed you
[09:12:14] <Urchlay> world's longest range sniper shot
[09:12:17] <KaMii> that one lady got hit with one and lived
[09:12:46] <ventYl> funny is that you will be first hit by it and just after then you'll hear sonic wave
[09:13:20] <KaMii> i think by the time its that far in the atmosphere, its already slowed down subsonic
[09:13:38] <KaMii> especailly if its small enough to hit you and not kill you
[09:13:43] <KaMii> not enough mass to be supersonic
[09:13:52] <ventYl> with subsonic speeds it probably wouldn't burn in atmosphere
[09:14:19] <KaMii> well it would be supersonic at high altitude, but probably slow to subsonic around 40,000 feet
[09:17:20] <ventYl> ok, skydiving terminal velocity is about 60 - 80 m/s. that's slower than shot fired from classic air rifle
[09:17:23] <KaMii> i dont think many objects in space are moving at subsonic speeds
[09:17:45] <KaMii> even that redbull guy went supersonic
[09:18:26] <rachael> what is the velocity of sound in space excatly ? :))

[09:18:42] <KaMii> good point...
[09:18:47] <pink_mist> NaN
[09:19:05] <ventYl> rachael: with long enough metal rod... quite a big :)
[09:19:11] <KaMii> isnt sound always constant or is it different dependent on atmospheric density?
[09:19:22] <KaMii> is sound slower in water?
[09:19:24] <rachael> depends on the density of the medium
[09:19:26] <ventYl> the more dense material it spreads the faster it spreads
[09:19:33] <rachael> is faster in water
[09:19:44] <ventYl> which in turn means that in space noone hears you screaming
[09:19:51] <KaMii> oh, well then... that changes everything
[09:20:17] <KaMii> in russia, space screams you
[09:20:37] <pink_mist> KaMii: I think sound might be faster in water
[09:20:47] <pink_mist> it certainly is a lot faster in metal
[09:20:51] <KaMii> yea, i think rachael is right
[09:21:03] <pink_mist> oh, I missed rachael's sentence :P
[09:21:06] <pink_mist> yeah
[09:21:24] <KaMii> but what is the speed of sound in the ocean?
[09:21:41] <pink_mist> probably depends on what depth you're at :P
[09:21:45] <Urchlay> has to do with pressure (and therefore depth), doesn't it?
[09:21:46] <ventYl> subsonic / supersonic speed has meaning only when considering strong sound waves in athmosphere interferring with regular turbulences around wings
[09:21:55] <KaMii> so, that sucks for whales, when they fart in the ocean, every animal can hear it
[09:22:05] <ventYl> and in fact only in speeds near speed of sound

[09:22:17] <Urchlay> whales are probably not all that self-conscious, compared to humans

[09:33:14] <KaMii> yea but miles makes no sense
[09:33:24] <KaMii> 3 feet in a yard
[09:33:28] <ventYl> Urchlay: problem with imperial system is that it makes no sense
[09:33:30] <Urchlay> if I were doing scientific research in an academic setting, then yes, metric makes much more sense
[09:33:35] <KaMii> 5280 feet in a mile
[09:33:35] <ventYl> there's 12 inches in yard
[09:33:38] <ventYl> in feet
[09:33:38] <KaMii> 12 inches in a foot
[09:33:42] <ventYl> foot
[09:33:44] <ventYl> whatever
[09:34:07] <ventYl> you can't do any computation in such weird system
[09:34:13] <Urchlay> if I'm talking to a regular human person that lives in my country, and I ask how much something weighs, or how far away something is, the answer won't be in kilograms or meters
[09:34:33] <Urchlay> (well, unless I'm asking about cocaine or heroin, that's normally measured in grams or kilos)
[09:34:37] <KaMii> unless its a 1 or 2 liter bottle
[09:34:38] <MLanden> Urchlay: or in stones
[09:34:43] <KaMii> everyone in the usa know those
[09:34:55] <KaMii> lol stones... only the brittish use that
[09:34:58] <KaMii> and it makes no sense

[09:35:14] <Urchlay> if I ask how much something weighs or how far away it is, and the answer is in liters, there's a miscommunication :)
[09:35:30] <KaMii> i mean volume for liter
[09:35:39] <Urchlay> the bit that I don't understand: the US gallon is different from the Imperial (aka british) gallon
[09:35:48] <ventYl> not only gallon
[09:35:56] <ventYl> probably every measurement unit
[09:36:05] <ventYl> miles do, pounds do (afaik), gallons do
[09:36:15] <Urchlay> nah, feet, inches, miles, pounds, cups, quarts are the same on both side of the pond

[09:36:26] <rachael> with a little luck yur grandchilden might get to use the SI
[09:36:30] <ventYl> afaik imperial mile is little bit shorter than US mile

[09:36:56] <pink_mist> lol
[09:36:56] <KaMii> scum
[09:36:59] <ventYl> actually
[09:37:02] <ventYl> there's three of them
[09:37:13] <ventYl> US mile, imperial mile and international mile
[09:37:23] <Urchlay> right but
[09:37:25] <pink_mist> and nautical mile
[09:37:29] <pink_mist> so 4
[09:37:34] <ventYl> let's make things a little more complicated and little more useless
[09:37:40] <Frizzank> Hi guys, I just installed SalixOS and Im having to use ndiswrapper for my wifi adapter (N-300 USB adapter WNA 3100) it says the driver is installed and hardware is present, but the adapter is not coming on. Any ideas on what I could try?
[09:37:52] <pink_mist> Frizzank: this is not #salix
[09:37:53] <Urchlay> if you lived here, you'd know about US miles, you'd have to use them daily
[09:37:55] <phrag> and a metric mile?
[09:37:59] <ventYl> pink_mist: which "knots" does air transportation use?

[09:40:22] <KaMii> fathing
[09:40:23] <KaMii> lol
[09:40:39] <ventYl> probably it's not even a system
[09:40:44] <ventYl> it just exists and it's used

[09:41:02] <Urchlay> rachael: I actually tried to learn the british currency system (I watch some of their TV, and I used to collect coins & had some old british coins)
[09:41:16] <ventYl> in case of computation you convert everything to metric system, perform computation and convert result back to imperial something in order to understand result
[09:41:58] <Urchlay> never could remember all the details. Think a farthing is 1/4 of a penny, there are some number of shillings in a pound (12? 20?) and some number of pounds in a guinea
[09:42:12] <ventYl> last step is crucial... otherwise you can smash your vessel against Mars surface
[09:42:17] <KaMii> Urchlay: dont forget quid
[09:42:22] <Urchlay> quid is slang
[09:42:29] <KaMii> yea but they use it all the time
[09:42:33] <Urchlay> IIRC slang for pound
[09:42:48] <KaMii> yea
[09:43:21] <Urchlay> if you try to read the original sherlock holmes stories, sometimes they talk about money and it confuses US readers
[09:43:43] <phrag> it confuses younger british readers =P
[09:43:55] <KaMii> lol
[09:44:26] <ventYl> Urchlay: but, to be honest. measurement "system" similar to imperial also did exist here before industrial revolution
[09:44:47] <KaMii> when your economic system is that screwed up, because you hat that many terms for money.. you know you have over thought it
[09:47:23] <Urchlay> the worst thing about competing systems... I have to own 2 sets of tools to work on my car. One car. Half the bolts are metric, half are standard, WTF?
[09:47:35] uggedal (~uggedal@li199-172.members.linode.com) joined ##slackware.
[09:47:42] <Urchlay> (actually I dunno about the car I have now, I'm thinking of the ones made in the 1980s)
[09:47:51] <KaMii> get one of those universal sets
[09:47:55] uggedal (~uggedal@li199-172.members.linode.com) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[09:47:57] <KaMii> they even work on alien cars
[09:48:06] <KaMii> and motherships
[09:48:09] <KaMii> because its universal
[09:48:11] <Urchlay> only if the alien cars run Mac OS and have USB ports
[09:48:12] <ventYl> or get car with only metric bolts
[09:48:21] <phrag> standard as in metric? =P
[09:48:26] <Urchlay> ventYl: oddly, that's not really something you can find out easily, about a car
[09:48:36] <adaptr> or get one of those tooless PC cases, no more screwing!
[09:48:48] <phrag> i like to screw
[09:48:57] <ventYl> Urchlay: depends on country :)
[09:49:00] <adaptr> shuddup King Julian
[09:49:10] <Urchlay> they mention things like horsepower, gas mileage, antilock brakes... but the salesman isn't going to know
[09:49:50] <Urchlay> the country I live in. Presumably in your country, that's been using metric forever, all the bolts are in millimeters and you don't have to worry about it
[09:49:56] RManDini (~sjsh2@115.193.190.88) joined ##slackware.
[09:50:17] <Urchlay> and no, I'm not made of money, not buying a car in europe and having it shipped here
[09:50:20] <ventYl> Urchlay: you have to remember how the whittwort's thread looks like in comparision to metric thread and randomly screw out two or three bolts and compare them
[09:50:37] <Urchlay> I wasn't even talking about the threads, just the bolt heads
[09:50:46] <ventYl> Urchlay: european cars shipped to US probably also uses metric system components only
[09:50:48] <KaMii> Urchlay: i dont think many cars are made in europe anymore
[09:51:00] <Urchlay> (doesn't matter if the threads are different unless I'm actually replacing a bolt, not putting in the one I took out earlier)
[09:51:15] <ventYl> Urchlay: bolts with imperial sized heads usually also have whittworth's thread
[09:51:36] <ventYl> nobody produces metric thread bolts with imperial sized heads
[09:51:43] <Urchlay> so far I haven't encountered a guitar that needs 2 sets of tools to work on, but I'm sure they exist.
[09:51:43] <ventYl> and vice versa
[09:52:31] <Urchlay> usually all you need is 2 or 3 sizes of allen wrench, a regular philips screwdriver, and maybe a jeweller's philips
[09:52:48] <ventYl> KaMii: in slovakia there are at least three distinct plants
[09:52:57] <Urchlay> but all 3 sizes of allen wrench will be found in the same set of them
[09:53:21] <KaMii> ventYl: oh, well i know there is at least one volvo plant left in Sweden in Gˆteborg
[09:53:36] <Urchlay> if I ever need an alien wrench, I'll ask KaMii

[10:02:07] <shadowsun> Unlike queryquads, splorcks, and vvrips
[10:02:17] <KaMii> i think we are global enough, we just need one set of measurements

[10:02:46] <KaMii> one measurement, to rule them all
[10:02:58] <KaMii> lord of the measurements
[10:03:13] <Urchlay> it would take a massive amount of time and money to replace all those road signs that say "next exit 3 miles" or "cartersville 10 miles"
[10:03:16] <KaMii> everything should be in frodo's and bilbo's
[10:03:37] <KaMii> Urchlay: you just slowly upgrade them
[10:03:40] fnord0 (~fnord0@unaffiliated/fnord0) joined ##slackware.
[10:03:45] <KaMii> they all wear out, thats when you replace it, when they wear out
[10:03:52] <Urchlay> in fact, they don't all say "miles". So you'd have a time period (probably 100 years) when you'd look at a road sign and not know what it means (10 miles? 10 km? who knows)
[10:03:59] <KaMii> why does everything have to be updated now!
[10:04:07] <Urchlay> no, people won't stand for having to use 2 measurement systems at once
[10:04:23] <KaMii> tell them to deal with it
[10:04:35] <KaMii> humans are adaptable
[10:04:54] <Urchlay> this is the US, not a fascist dictatorship, our politicians can't say "deal with it" if they want to get re-elected

[10:06:26] <Urchlay> ventYl: right, and it's a pain in the ass, but the general public isn't working on cars every single day (only mechanics are affected by it regularly)

[10:31:08] <d4wnr4z0r> they don't keep crazy people, as it turns out.
[10:31:15] <pink_mist> heh
[10:31:26] <KaMii> lol
[10:31:36] <wood_quinn> Sure they do, as long as you're not crayZ they'll keep ya.
[10:31:45] <KaMii> he was caught in the closet snifing glue
[10:31:48] <gnisho> Well, they're not _supposed_ to keep crazy people, but it happens.
[10:31:50] <pink_mist> I actually got out of military service here in sweden on the psych exam :P was so happy :P
[10:32:00] <d4wnr4z0r> heh
[10:32:08] <wood_quinn> I would never be qualified for military service.
[10:32:11] <KaMii> pink_mist: how did you end up getting picked for military?
[10:32:15] <wood_quinn> Don't know if I really mind.
[10:32:15] <KaMii> no one goes to military
[10:32:21] <pink_mist> KaMii: that was back when *everyone* had to
[10:32:31] <KaMii> but i thought everyone found a way out
[10:32:40] <pink_mist> KaMii: well yeah .. my way out was the psych exam :P
[10:32:50] <wood_quinn> Mandatory military service seems like an odd concept to me, but I know a few places do it.
[10:32:56] <KaMii> lol, what did you do?  maked noises like a chicken?
[10:33:27] <pink_mist> lol, nah, just complained about sleeping problems, and how I would be unable to sleep in dormitories :P worked like a charm :P
[10:33:37] <gnisho> You can always just go straight over to the group 'w' bench.
[10:33:41] <pink_mist> wasn't untrue either~~
[10:33:48] <KaMii> lol
[10:33:51] <wood_quinn> All you really have to do is complain about the military's actions haha.
[10:33:57] <gnisho> that tends to signal something to the recruiters.
[10:34:05] <KaMii> i cant pee next to other people, ok you cant be in the military
[10:34:42] <wood_quinn> When I get into stressful situations, I have orgasms for no reason.
[10:34:50] <pink_mist> lmao
[10:34:54] <KaMii> lol
[10:34:55] <wood_quinn> "Oh. Ok well you're not eligible for service..."

[10:35:13] <wood_quinn> War wer declared.

[10:36:52] <KaMii> i thought so
[10:36:56] <KaMii> didnt they?
[10:37:07] <d4wnr4z0r> they have for years, kind of. "don't ask, don't tell".
[10:37:10] <KaMii> i heard something like, its ok to be gay, join the army
[10:37:10] <wood_quinn> I thought they always did, but your CO would usually request you be transfered somewhere <nothere>
[10:37:22] <d4wnr4z0r> they weren't allowed to ask, and you didn't have to tell.

[10:37:57] <adaptr> d4wnr4z0r: I was under the impression it was rather the reverse: as long as you didn't tell, they didn't have to ask. as soon as you do, they do, and you're out.

[10:38:47] <gnisho> DADT gas been gone for a few years now.  It's OK to be out and proud now.  While I was in, DADT was a bad joke anyway, as Teh Ebil Gays tended to be out anyway, and didn't really get any flak for it.
[10:39:41] <d4wnr4z0r> since 2011
[10:39:55] <d4wnr4z0r> and apparently my understanding of the policy is a little inaccurate, if wiki is to be trusted on this matter
[10:40:14] <wood_quinn> Gosh when will it end. Soon we'll be allowing cat owners into the military too.
[10:40:22] <wood_quinn> Then our status as a superpower will end.
[10:40:57] <KaMii> whats wrong with cats?
[10:41:04] <gnisho> It's all downhill from here.  Next thing you know, filthy litterbugs will be allowed in as well.
[10:41:31] <KaMii> and hippies!
[10:41:32] <wood_quinn> Clearly owning a cat makes you a target for foreign interests .\/.
[10:41:36] <KaMii> gods damned hippies!
[10:41:52] <d4wnr4z0r> hippies don't make it past the "conscientious objector" question.
[10:42:03] <KaMii> whats that?
[10:42:13] <d4wnr4z0r> it means "are you willing to kill someone?"
[10:42:27] <KaMii> of course they are
[10:42:40] <KaMii> you jsut have to know how to motivate a hippie
[10:42:48] <KaMii> tell them the enemy is killering whales
[10:42:52] <wood_quinn> Only if that someone took away their weed, nachos, or van.
[10:42:55] <KaMii> they will kill the enemy
[10:46:15] <wood_quinn> I will kill all the druids.
[10:47:30] <KaMii> nopes
[10:47:53] <wood_quinn> They are racially impure Druids.

[11:06:18] <KaMii> and how did you get that?  mine keyboard wont let me do umlaut u anymore
[11:06:23] <Urchlay> compose character
[11:06:25] <KaMii> or accents on vowels
[11:06:30] <KaMii> stupid thing
[11:06:34] <Urchlay> right-alt, u, quote
[11:06:44] <KaMii> does nothing
[11:06:56] <pink_mist> KaMii: you can't do ®+u?
[11:07:03] <Urchlay> right, because you have to use xmodmap to set your right-alt up as a compose key
[11:07:41] <KaMii> my right alt is a altgr already
[11:07:41] <Urchlay> http://dpaste.com/891424/  (you don't need the whole thing, just the 3rd stanza)
[11:07:46] <KaMii> but for some reason it wont let me
[11:07:58] <wood_quinn> Speaking of which, I finally figured out that modifying my right Alt key was what was screwing up my left.
[11:08:00] <KaMii> and its really been pissing me off
[11:08:10] <Urchlay> ah, you have one o' them you-row-peein' keyboards
[11:08:21] <wood_quinn> No idea why, but I decided if I had to choose one it had to be L_Alt.
[11:08:37] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: weird.
[11:09:03] <KaMii> pink_mist: whats your xmodmap look like?
[11:09:06] <Urchlay> I'd want left-alt to actually be alt, I use alt-1 through alt-4 to jump between virtual desktops
[11:09:40] <KaMii> yea i do that too Urchlay
[11:09:47] <Urchlay> and sometimes alt-E A in gui apps (Edit -> Select All) or alt-F S (File -> Save)
[11:09:52] <KaMii> and shift + alt + arrorws to move them

[11:11:19] <Urchlay> actually don't use the keyboard for firing (use the mouse... which is on the left side of the keyboard, hence the arrow keys for movement)

[11:15:55] <pink_mist> why?

[11:28:48] <KaMii> shes Swedens Paris Hilton, except she a princess and paris is...
[11:29:02] <Urchlay> pink_mist: well, it was just a theory
[11:29:10] <KaMii> wood_quinn: can you see pink_mist's umlauts?
[11:29:12] <Urchlay> *something* is different between her umlauts and mine
[11:29:19] <pink_mist> Â‰ˆ¸
[11:30:30] <KaMii> maybe its a weechat thing?
[11:31:10] <pink_mist> ÈË‡˘Í‚ÓÙ˚ÁÎÔ¸ˇa~‰ˆ·ÌÒ
[11:31:13] <Urchlay> if your umlauts were encoded the same way mine are, his client would be treating them the same way (they'd both work, or neither)
[11:31:26] <KaMii> wood_quinn:
[11:31:35] <Urchlay> pink_mist: you shouldn't paste your root password in the channel :)
[11:31:37] <KaMii> maybe he is burning food
[11:31:40] <pink_mist> Urchlay: lol
[11:31:47] <wood_quinn> Interesting. I can see pink_mist;s
[11:31:49] <KaMii> lol, can you use umlauts in a password?
[11:31:55] <Urchlay> probably
[11:32:06] <KaMii> i never treid, i was always afraid it wont pickup
[11:32:11] <pink_mist> it would depend on the keymap in play before login
[11:32:12] <KaMii> then i would be locked out forever
[11:32:19] <Urchlay> but good luck typing them on the console, or in an X login app before your keymap is loaded
[11:32:31] <pink_mist> it may work differently during console login, x login, and x screensaver unlock
[11:32:37] <KaMii> yea, like my lvm-luks encrypted drive
[11:32:41] <Urchlay> KaMii: takes like 5 seconds to create a test user and try it with that user instead of yours
[11:32:42] <pink_mist> I would stay away from it
[11:32:47] <KaMii> can you load a keymap in initrd?
[11:33:00] <pink_mist> I'm going to guess yes
[11:33:04] <Urchlay> you can load a keymap in /etc/rc.d/rc.keymap
[11:33:09] <nerdix> KaMii, if you don#t ue full encrypted disks then you can easyly reset your root pw using any linux live system
[11:33:26] <KaMii> yea, but i do on some of my sysetms
[11:33:27] <pink_mist> and then there's also a question of if the password will work if you ssh in from another box
[11:33:55] <KaMii> yea.. well i dont care about user logins, im more wondering about lvm-luks encrypted drives
[11:34:02] <Urchlay> use public key auth
[11:34:04] <KaMii> because once its mounted ssh doesnt mean anything
[11:34:09] <pink_mist> Urchlay: indeed =)
[11:34:15] <KaMii> Urchlay: what do you mean?
[11:34:25] <Urchlay> KaMii: aka "passwordless ssh"
[11:34:28] <KaMii> so the drive auto unlocks during boot?
[11:34:32] <KaMii> oh, for ssh, yea
[11:34:34] <Urchlay> no, I'm still talking about ssh
[11:34:45] <Urchlay> no idea about encrypted partitions, I haven't used them
[11:34:47] <KaMii> yea, i have been thinkgin about doing that... but havent yet
[11:34:49] <KaMii> is it safe?
[11:34:52] MLanden (~MLanden@pool-108-26-83-63.nrflva.east.verizon.net) left irc: Quit: "Take care,all!!"
[11:35:06] <pink_mist> it's much safer than using a password really
[11:35:06] <KaMii> i just wasnt sure if public keys over ssh is really secure
[11:35:15] <KaMii> because of keyboard loggers?
[11:35:27] <pink_mist> for one thing, yes .. also, passwords tend to be a lot shorter
[11:35:32] <shonudo> good morning all
[11:35:44] <pink_mist> morning shonudo
[11:35:50] <shonudo> hey pink_mist
[11:35:58] <KaMii> oh... so I can just create a huge randomness of crap, then use a rsa public key and forever forget my user password?
[11:36:10] <Urchlay> if someone steals your laptop with your keys on it, change them on the server (or laugh, because you encrypt your laptop's /home partition)
[11:36:11] <KaMii> then when im physically at that boxen... im scrwed
[11:36:22] <pink_mist> KaMii: well .. I'd still store my private key encrypted ... you'd still need to remember a password for that =)
[11:36:34] <KaMii> Urchlay: my laptop has / encrypted then it has /home encrypted
[11:36:45] <d4wnr4z0r> if your key is passphrase-protected, someone can steal your laptop and still not have access
[11:36:48] <Urchlay> why bother encrypting / if /home is separate?
[11:36:50] <KaMii> i never set that up...
[11:36:50] <pink_mist> I really should set up encryption on my laptop hdd :>
[11:36:59] <KaMii> pink_mist: got a good link on how to set that stuff up?
[11:37:01] <KaMii> a wiki?
[11:37:10] <Urchlay> I mean, on a normal setup, if /home is its own partition, there's no personal data on / anyway
[11:37:18] <KaMii> yea, i put encrypted root and /home on all my laptops

[11:37:52] <KaMii> d4wnr4z0r: thats for lvm luks stuff
[11:38:12] <d4wnr4z0r> KaMii: yeah, I misunderstood your question
[11:38:16] nullby7e (~null@unaffiliated/nullby7e) joined ##slackware.
[11:38:23] <KaMii> pink_mist: thanks, i will have to read though that and set things up
[11:38:40] <pink_mist> KaMii: just do one thing at a time really :P but yeah, it's worth reading through it all =)
[11:38:43] <KaMii> im always tryig to figure out better ways to do things, just been paranoid about keys
[11:38:54] <Urchlay> almost everything outside of /home is either straight from the install DVD, or a temporary file, or a log
[11:39:02] <pink_mist> the 'don't type passwords' bit is the one you should read for the current issue =)
[11:39:14] <KaMii> Urchlay: true, but a double layer of encryption just really slows people down
[11:39:15] <Urchlay> (I doubt you use /var/spool/mail, plenty of personal info might be in there if you do)
[11:39:24] <Urchlay> including yourself
[11:39:41] <KaMii> Urchlay: well if pine uses /var/spool/mail/ then yes
[11:39:48] <d4wnr4z0r> keys are great, and have a number of additional security features one can utilize
[11:39:52] <Urchlay> it can use it. No idea what it does out-of-the-box.
[11:40:20] <KaMii> i switched over to pine because seamonkey was pissing me off
[11:40:29] <KaMii> eating too much resources on my netbook
[11:40:35] <Urchlay> what protocol is pine using? imap?
[11:41:06] <KaMii> ummm i think so yea
[11:41:42] <Urchlay> it can be configured to download all the mail with imap, or leave it on the server... but if it downloads it, likely it's storing it in $HOME
[11:42:00] <wood_quinn> I think pine uses ~/mail
[11:42:33] <Urchlay> you'd only be using /var/spool/mail if you were receiving mail for real (like, if you ran sendmail and had a proper DNS record so mail to your domain gets routed to you)
[11:42:54] <Crosma> This is pretty cool: http://stereopsis.com/flux/linux.html
[11:43:18] <Urchlay> or if you use fetchmail + a local mail delivery agent (procmail)
[11:43:41] <Urchlay> but if all the above is totally unfamiliar to you, it's probably just using ~/mail or such
[11:44:30] Action: wood_quinn still wants to figure out how to send mail from wood_quinn@localhost to the internet.
[11:44:48] nullby7e (~null@unaffiliated/nullby7e) left irc: Quit: disconnecting.
[11:44:54] <KaMii> pink_mist: so.. now instead of typing the user password evertime with an rsa key i have to type in the rsa key passphrase?
[11:44:55] <Urchlay> probably you can't. If you can, nobody can answer you anyway
[11:44:59] <KaMii> this makes no sense
[11:45:10] Action: wood_quinn wants to spam you all!
[11:45:27] <wood_quinn> KaMii: You shouldn't have to enter a passphrase.

[11:45:46] <pink_mist> only once per boot
[11:45:47] <Urchlay> Crosma: what does it actually do? alter the brightness/gamma of your monitor based on what a server tells it is the light level in your zip code?
[11:46:10] <KaMii> pink_mist: oh, i didnt setup ssh-agent
[11:46:15] <Crosma> Yeah, it just changes your colour temperature on the fly. I guess it's not that special.
[11:46:16] <pink_mist> KaMii: or use http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/misc/keychain/
[11:46:54] <Crosma> Red is better at night and blue is better at day, because we is still aminals.

[11:52:03] <fuzzix> Now I am, how you say, une fat basterd.
[11:52:20] <Urchlay> I tried quitting once, whenever I felt the nic fit coming on, I'd play harmonica
[11:52:34] <Skywise> you don't wanna replace a bad habit with another, you just wanna end the habit
[11:52:38] <Urchlay> people were giving me all these free cigarettes, begging me to stop
[11:52:49] <Strum> but that made you wife kids and dog leave you Urchlay?
[11:52:54] <pink_mist> KaMii: and keychain is meant to export a couple of environment variables to your current shell, so you use the correct ssh-agent instance
[11:53:18] <Urchlay> nah. Never married, no kids that I know of, and my dog likes my harmonica playing (he's probably tone-deaf)
[11:53:27] <ananke> keychain rocks

[11:53:54] <Strum> did you play the harmonica before you gave up smoking?
[11:54:04] <Urchlay> yeah
[11:54:04] <KaMii> yea i just did ssh-add
[11:54:06] <KaMii> then ssh-agent
[11:54:17] <Urchlay> and I didn't really give up smoking, I just tried to (and failed)
[11:54:21] <Strum> then no surprise you have no wife , kids or dog

[12:04:20] <Urchlay> it's both (the alias takes precedence though)
[12:04:34] <Urchlay> same as echo is a shell builtin, but there's also a /usr/bin/echo
[12:05:14] <wood_quinn> I dealias all of the defaults in my .bash_profile
[12:05:19] <slacktivist> the alias also works if you have colors set for ls
[12:05:20] <Urchlay> I should alias xs and vf to cd (I type those if my fingers aren't quite on the home row...)
[12:05:27] <slacktivist> works + better
[12:05:45] <ananke> one way you can usually tell if somebody is a sysadmin: they don't rely much on customization of their shell environment
[12:05:52] <Urchlay> heh. looking at my aliases... alias movplay='xanim +Aev90 +Ss2'
[12:06:01] <Urchlay> that's probably been in .bashrc since 1997
[12:06:15] <Urchlay> (seriously, when's the last time anyone used xanim?)
[12:06:53] <ananke> i haven't seen somebody mention xanim since 1997
[12:07:16] <KaMii> now... if i could only get my stupid cabel modem to let me go static... I wont have a huge mess when it releases ip's
[12:07:27] <wood_quinn> Cabal modem.
[12:07:39] nullby7e (~null@unaffiliated/nullby7e) left irc: Quit: disconnecting.
[12:07:48] <wood_quinn> I've got a ..="cd .." alias
[12:07:51] <Urchlay> modem, I'm edom
[12:08:03] <wood_quinn> And df=df -h, du=du -h
[12:08:18] <Urchlay> ah, the .. alias makes sense
[12:08:19] <pink_mist> that .. one seems useful actually
[12:08:20] <pink_mist> nice
[12:08:35] <Urchlay> I don't like aliases that redefine how commands work without renaming them
[12:08:50] <wood_quinn> df and du are fairly innocuous.
[12:08:54] <Urchlay> yeah
[12:08:56] <wood_quinn> You wouldn't like what I do to ls though.
[12:09:19] <Urchlay> until I use someone else's system, and I'm used to not having to type -h, and so I keep forgetting to, and complaining the whole time
[12:09:20] <d4wnr4z0r> I use the .. one
[12:09:41] <d4wnr4z0r> have for years. when I'm at work I'm always type .., followed be cd .. since there's no alias. :(
[12:09:43] <Urchlay> I have a mkcd() that does 'mkdir "$1" && cd "$1"'
[12:10:10] <d4wnr4z0r> or psa for ps auxww
[12:10:11] <pink_mist> d4wnr4z0r: you can't *set* an alias? =)
[12:10:23] <Urchlay> but the only reason I remembered I have it, is that I was just now looking at all the old cruft in my .bashrc :)
[12:10:30] <d4wnr4z0r> pink_mist: sometimes I do but usually it's not really worth it
[12:10:31] <wood_quinn> Oh I also use mkdi="mkdir -p"
[12:10:43] <Urchlay> why not just md instead of mkdi?
[12:10:45] <wood_quinn> Since any screwups caused by that are pretty harmless.
[12:10:52] <d4wnr4z0r> I do end up doing 'set -o vi' most of the time, though
[12:10:55] <wood_quinn> *mkdir=
[12:11:25] <d4wnr4z0r> I usually can't get through more than a few commands without emacs mode driving me insane.
[12:11:27] <Urchlay> I don't like commands behaving differently interactively than they do in a script, is why I don't like aliases like that
[12:11:32] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Whenever I do release upgrades I actually read all of my dotfiles to see if they're worth keeping.
[12:11:47] <Urchlay> (because I tend to test script code by pasting parts of it into an interactive shell, I mean)
[12:11:53] <wood_quinn> Or if there are any unfuck tr aliases.

[12:17:32] <wood_quinn> For your directfb stuff?
[12:17:49] <d4wnr4z0r> "Programs that write programs are the happiest programs in the world."
[12:17:53] <Urchlay> it actually worked as intended too: it let me compile old versions of gtk (like 2.12 and 2.15) against slackware 14's glib
[12:18:11] <d4wnr4z0r> which means the autoshit tools are exceedingly happy programs.
[12:18:17] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: yeah. It'll get replaced with something more maintainable, when/if I ever release anything
[12:18:45] <Urchlay> autotools aren't just happy, they're monomaniac (they're totally self-absorbed)
[12:18:51] <wood_quinn> Maintainability? Pft.
[12:18:53] <d4wnr4z0r> indeed
[12:19:10] <d4wnr4z0r> I'm particularly fond of PHK's rant on the subject.
[12:19:27] <wood_quinn> If RMS uses it, I have to.
[12:19:28] <wood_quinn> Sorry.
[12:19:32] <Urchlay> however, doing all this crazy gtk stuff, I'm glad I'm using autotools (bad as it is) rather than cmake (which is even worse) or scons (which makes no sense to me)

[12:24:32] <Urchlay> it's easier to read than real old english
[12:24:51] <d4wnr4z0r> that's because real old english is very different language
[12:24:55] <Urchlay> I know
[12:25:00] <wood_quinn> Like Canadian.
[12:25:03] <wood_quinn> Eh?

[12:25:33] <Urchlay> not taking a class, just trying to read an edition of beowulf with old english on the left page and modern on the right
[12:25:56] <d4wnr4z0r> but again... why?
[12:26:18] <wood_quinn> Beowulf/wolf the movies was horrendous.

[12:26:47] <wood_quinn> I didn't finish it.
[12:26:50] <Urchlay> I like languages (even if I'm better at computer ones than human ones), and I had read a series of books set in england in the 9th century, it had old english and old norse in some of the dialogue
[12:26:55] <wood_quinn> At least if I did, I don't remember how it ended.
[12:27:09] <d4wnr4z0r> ah, I see. I can dig that, I like languages too.
[12:27:11] <KaMii> i heard it was soo bad its impossible to bash it
[12:27:23] <d4wnr4z0r> problem is having no one to talk to in $lang
[12:27:27] <Urchlay> yeah
[12:28:00] <Urchlay> took latin in high school, got A+ four semesters in a row, then forgot all of it cause I had nobody to speak it to

[12:28:42] <d4wnr4z0r> I took french in high school. I still know how to tell someone my name, say I've very hungry, say shit, and ask a hooker if she'd like to sleep with me tonight.
[12:29:07] <d4wnr4z0r> studied German on my own for a bit till the grammar broke my brain.
[12:29:34] <Urchlay> haurimus fumere herbam dementii

[12:35:50] <wood_quinn> GOOD JOBIRU!
[12:35:50] <d4wnr4z0r> yeah, they import a lot of words
[12:35:51] <Urchlay> "engine" is the same word, pronounced differently
[12:36:36] <d4wnr4z0r> but sometimes it's hard to tell because they lack certain sounds, so "love" might become "ra-bu"
[12:36:50] <ventYl> ra-pe
[12:36:52] <Urchlay> pink_mist: this guy was one of those who starts 10 projects at once and never finishes any of them. He learned 6502 assembly language and bought some kind of flash cart for his NES, then never did finish the NES game he was writing

[12:37:45] <wood_quinn> SO WISE!
[12:38:06] <d4wnr4z0r> and also because the only syllable that doesn't end in a vowel is "n", though certain others sometimes silence the vowel, like "su"

[12:39:17] <Urchlay> Custer's Revenge
[12:39:18] <wood_quinn> Don't think it was allowed to be sold for long.
[12:39:37] <d4wnr4z0r> bei-su-ba-ru, more likely
[12:39:38] <wood_quinn> Oh yeah you're right. It was the Atari not the NES.
[12:39:38] <ventYl> there's zine for rape sexual games in japan published quarterly
[12:39:44] <Urchlay> most peoples' complaint was that it was a really shitty game, even by 2600 standards
[12:40:17] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[12:40:50] <Urchlay> there was a texas chainsaw massacre game where you're the guy with the chainsaw, chasing kittle kids around to kill them
[12:41:08] <wood_quinn> Speaking of that, anyone seen the new movie?
[12:41:27] <Urchlay> but it sucked as a game too. The kids could teleport (they'd just jump away from you), and you'd run out of chainsaw fuel with no way to refill

[12:56:12] <Urchlay> ventYl: a guy once showed me an assignment he got in a class... implement an emulator for a SIC (single-instruction computer, all it had was "subtract and branch on negative result")
[12:56:16] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Yep that's from the competition.
[12:56:39] <Urchlay> there were 3 or 4 sample SIC programs, his emulator had to run them correctly
[12:56:59] <wood_quinn> My buddies and I got sick of that game though.
[12:57:12] <wood_quinn> With four teams, it was pretty random whether or not you'd win.
[12:58:03] <Urchlay> oh, when you were talking about a robots game, you meant that kind of game? (you program the robots, they play the game against the other guy's pre-programmed robots?)
[12:58:16] <ventYl> Urchlay: really hard stuff is to write C compiler for it
[12:58:22] <wood_quinn> Nope. Robots was a GNOME game I think.
[12:58:25] <Urchlay> I was thinking you were talking about an atari 2600 game

[12:59:47] <ventYl> Urchlay: mine has 19 instructions at all
[12:59:50] <Urchlay> ventYl: I think he did have to write a compiler for it... not C though. Not all of C anyway (maybe C without structs, typedefs, enums, and with only the int type)
[13:00:14] <Urchlay> maybe even without arrays or pointers, I dunno
[13:00:38] <wood_quinn> declare -A pointer
[13:00:43] <ventYl> advantage of such instruction set is that you can omit it completely
[13:00:47] <Urchlay> 19? too bad you couldn't pare it down to 16 instructions, could make it a 4-bit CPU
[13:00:48] <ventYl> and write only arguments
[13:01:33] <ventYl> in fact some of them can be omitted with little impact of code complexity

[13:02:36] <Urchlay> which really was a 4-bit CPU (with an 8-bit address bus, so you got 128 bytes of ram and 128 ROM)
[13:02:58] <Urchlay> well, 128 nybbles, not bytes
[13:03:02] <wood_quinn> Hehe.
[13:03:12] <ventYl> this one is 16bit
[13:03:53] <Urchlay> the weirdest asm I ever read about (but didn't write any code in) was for the CPU in the old Intellivision console. 10-bit data bus.
[13:04:05] <Urchlay> 10 bits was called a decle, and 5 bits was a nyckel

[16:00:40] <pink_mist> and there's slackpkg for official slackware packages, and there's sbotools or sbopkg for third-party stuff
[16:00:44] <peaceblaster> Ok, thanks, I just saw on the site something about it only being 32 bit
[16:00:49] <pink_mist> what
[16:01:00] <pink_mist> if you saw that, you read something weird
[16:01:01] <ananke> peaceblaster: support for overclocked hardware is unrelated to an OS
[16:01:29] <pink_mist> there's a 32bit version of slackware, and there's a 64bit version of slackware.
[16:01:38] <pink_mist> they are both official
[16:01:39] <peaceblaster> http://www.slackware.com/info/ the paragraph at the bottom had me a bit worried, but maybe I'm just paranoid XD
[16:02:02] <ananke> yeah. welcome to crappy out-of-date information on slackware.com
[16:02:05] <ananke> won't be the last time

[16:02:25] <peaceblaster> Noted. If I end up super into Slackware I'd gladly help update it
[16:02:28] <pink_mist> yeah, that's probably from like 1998 or so
[16:02:50] <peaceblaster> Also, I can't seem to find much info on it's package management
[16:02:53] <peaceblaster> LOL
[16:02:58] <pink_mist> back when it was actually worthwhile to point out that it wasn't 16-bit :P
[16:03:24] <pink_mist> peaceblaster: I just told you: slackpkg for official packages, sbotools or sbopkg for 3rd-party stuff
[16:04:33] <pink_mist> peaceblaster: and do a full install. or if you have any problem that you can't sort out yourself, and come in here for help, we'll just tell you "you should have done a full install" :>
[16:04:34] <peaceblaster> Ok, and is there a wide range of supported software? I'm not too picky about it, but if I could run steam beta that'd be great
[16:05:26] <peaceblaster> noted. I'm getting an extra hard drive to try it on later today, so I'll get on that. Will the install disc take me through to process somewhat easily?
[16:05:31] <pink_mist> 3rd-party software isn't *supported*, but there's probably ways to get it to run ... I expect there's a topic about steam on the slackware sub-forum on linuxquestions.org

[16:36:45] <Skywise> i'd say if you got < 1/2gb, you should using a whole flash drive
[16:37:59] <peaceblaster> Could you run Slackware entirely from a flashdrive? Without everything resetting after each restart?
[16:38:07] <TheM4ch1n3> did you hear they have technology that removes the wear level problem with flash memory, by heating the capacitors or whatever to around 500c for a short time, to -reset its working ability
[16:38:39] <TheM4ch1n3> peaceblaster: yes, by using the infamous initrd , mkinitrd
[16:39:01] <Skywise> i think a 32gb flash drive would be fine, but a little slow
[16:39:32] <peaceblaster> That sounds exciting! Especially since I use an SSD (it's the only way I can tolerate Windows, and even then any Linux distro I've tried booted and ran faster on a normal hard drive)
[16:40:22] <Skywise> ssd prices are falling faster then hdd

[20:09:26] <BrokenCog> more like closer to a thousand by end of production, but it's still an assembly line - which is the issue of mass producing.

[20:11:37] <hackedhead> Skywise: legos are a terrible example in this case, since production quality of them is so effing high. hahaha
[20:11:40] <Skywise> jet engines are built by hand, in rolls royce its built up by 1 person
[20:11:58] <BrokenCog> that's not what the original point was - mass produced was meant as automation.  not quantity, and they are made using machines/autamation.
[20:12:08] <Skywise> no, planes aren't
[20:12:09] <hackedhead> BrokenCog: except, they're not.
[20:12:24] <Skywise> they're hand crafted
[20:12:36] <BrokenCog> but, until I get pictures of the plants in Everett where my friends work, I'm not arguing it.
[20:12:38] <hackedhead> BrokenCog: planes are very much built by "hand" not on an assembly line with no attention
[20:12:42] Nick change: brad__ -> sencha
[20:12:46] <Skywise> they use factories and cranes
[20:12:52] Zordrak (~jaz@87-194-137-223.bethere.co.uk) joined ##slackware.
[20:13:10] <BrokenCog> by that tokens cars are made by hand.
[20:13:25] <d4wnr4z0r> that's true.
[20:13:26] <Skywise> but the only thing mass produced would be the tires, even the seats are custom built for each plane
[20:13:33] <d4wnr4z0r> a robot's hand, but a hand nonetheless.
[20:13:52] <hackedhead> airplanes don't even get that treatment, afaik
[20:13:52] <BrokenCog> a wowan on a line with a welder stick or whatever bang bang bang ... it's just a faster line.
[20:14:01] <BrokenCog> some with robots, not all.
[20:14:04] <Skywise> cars are welded together from stamped panels in a continuous assembly run
[20:14:10] <BrokenCog> and, robots are only recent.
[20:14:18] <Skywise> but they're universal
[20:14:21] <BrokenCog> it's the same process.  just slower.
[20:14:27] <Skywise> and they make product by the millions
[20:14:32] <hackedhead> BrokenCog: slower being the operative difference
[20:14:40] <Skywise> its volume doesn't compare
[20:14:42] <hackedhead> BrokenCog: way more attention to detail, way less tolerance of error
[20:14:54] <d4wnr4z0r> even so, flukes will happen.
[20:15:05] <d4wnr4z0r> there is no perfection anywhere. except maybe legos.
[20:15:09] <Skywise> yeah, military aircraft production is even slower then civilian aircraft
[20:15:15] <BrokenCog> well, a difference, but they are produced as fast as they can be - with as much automation as they can get.  Thats' my friends job - solely to research new ways of automating production.
[20:15:28] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: that's the point.
[20:15:43] <d4wnr4z0r> indeed
[20:15:45] <Skywise> even automation wouldn't make it mass production
[20:15:51] <hackedhead> BrokenCog: the whole reason it requires research is because the process accepts way less tolerance than cars
[20:15:57] <BrokenCog> then you have a broken definition of mass production.
[20:16:02] <zenlunatic> you guys are being way to nerdy for a friday night
[20:16:03] <Skywise> we're talking dozens a year vs millions
[20:16:06] <hackedhead> ^
[20:16:20] <Skywise> theres a magnatude of difference
[20:16:28] <d4wnr4z0r> many of us may not be well-versed in how to not be nerdy.
[20:16:30] <hackedhead> BrokenCog: you're conflating "mass production" and "automation" unnecessarily
[20:16:35] <Skywise> yes
[20:16:50] <BrokenCog> re tolerance.  no, problem is size.  robot arms don't typically reach 80 feet into the air. or traverse 300 feet.
[20:17:05] <BrokenCog> hackedhead: maybe a little.
[20:17:14] <BrokenCog> tolerance is easy.
[20:17:17] <Skywise> like chips are mass produced almost entirely robotically
[20:17:29] <hackedhead> planes are built with much less automation than cars at the moment. but that's totally distinct from whether or not they're produced "en masse" (in large qauantities)
[20:17:30] <BrokenCog> with even less tolerance
[20:17:35] <BrokenCog> er, more tolerance ...
[20:17:42] <hackedhead> less
[20:17:43] <Skywise> its not the automation, its the volume of production
[20:17:46] <hackedhead> yeah
[20:17:57] <hackedhead> volume is the key point of "mass production"
[20:17:57] <Skywise> ford mass produces cars, ferrarri doesn't
[20:18:01] <hackedhead> yeah
[20:18:35] <Skywise> and ford wishes they had ferrari's robots
[20:18:38] <BrokenCog> well, the original comment was that mass production inherintly has flaws, which is true b/c mass production does not have the singleton attention of a sole creator, ipso facto.
[20:18:45] <hackedhead> BrokenCog: on the other hand, tolerance for chip and cars doesn't cause people to fall out the sky from 30K ft.  so....
[20:19:02] <BrokenCog> hackedhead: arguably.  won't flies those planes?
[20:19:06] <BrokenCog> not people.
[20:19:13] <BrokenCog> s/won't/what/
[20:19:23] <d4wnr4z0r> er
[20:19:29] <Skywise> when you're building turbine blades for aircraft, each one is indeed perfect and flawless and has been tested and measured to ensure that it is
[20:19:41] <BrokenCog> Skywise: same as a Ford has.

[20:20:26] <hackedhead> Skywise: doesn't matter
[20:20:28] <d4wnr4z0r> BrokenCog: happens in the military *all the time*
[20:20:30] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: it's boring after the first five minutes.
[20:20:40] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: corner case.
[20:20:50] <BrokenCog> and even then _lot's of_ automation.
[20:20:53] <hackedhead> Skywise: unlesss you're counting atoms and growing solid matrices with defined counts of carbon rings, you can't really call it "perfect"
[20:20:54] <Skywise> they're grown from a single crystal of metal
[20:20:56] <d4wnr4z0r> corner case that accounts for a very significant portion of the flying that's done?
[20:21:04] <Skywise> hackedhead, thats exactly what they do
[20:21:11] <BrokenCog> they just empahsise the "rest of the time."
[20:21:30] <hackedhead> Skywise: i very much doubt that. to my point: how many carbon atoms in a turbine blade?
[20:21:36] <Skywise> they're as perfect as they can measure
[20:21:38] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: what's the most important component on the F-* ?
[20:21:47] <hackedhead> Skywise: that's a _very_ different statement.
[20:21:53] <d4wnr4z0r> BrokenCog: the pilot.

[20:22:11] <BrokenCog> at all.
[20:22:26] <d4wnr4z0r> nor could the computer fly without the pilot. nor could anything else happen without the pilot.
[20:22:32] <BrokenCog> they are't aerodynamically stable like they used to be.
[20:22:37] <hackedhead> d4wnr4z0r: no, he's actually right
[20:22:40] <d4wnr4z0r> people are always the most important factor, the most important resource, in any case.
[20:22:42] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: not realy.  drone, anyone?
[20:22:52] <BrokenCog> drone's are pointed, not flown.
[20:22:55] <d4wnr4z0r> BrokenCog: logic fail, you asked about piloted planes.
[20:23:07] <hackedhead> d4wnr4z0r: that lastest F* planes require the reaction time of the computer for aerlions controls fine adjust, pilots are not fast enough to keep the plane stable
[20:23:10] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: what?  no. you assumed that catergory.
[20:23:18] <hackedhead> d4wnr4z0r: the computer has a much better shot of flying solo than the pilot does.
[20:23:29] <d4wnr4z0r> BrokenCog: no, you imposed it. F-*, what Fighter is not piloted?
[20:23:42] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: ahhh.  okay.  my mistake ...
[20:23:52] <hackedhead> d4wnr4z0r: it hardly matter, since he's still right, it's the computer.
[20:24:09] <zenlunatic> actually all next-gen fighters will be both manual and remote capable
[20:24:22] <BrokenCog> look at this - since the 80s ILS CAT iv Landings are, by definition automated.

[20:29:23] <BrokenCog> d4wnr4z0r: could be.  it's solved now, but it was a slow solution.
[20:29:34] <Skywise> Paul -   In terms of the crystal orientation, weíve got a few degrees of orientation that we need to hit.  In terms of dimensional requirements, the drawing usually requires us to be within 0.1 or 0.2 of a millimetre of the required position, and so, weíll check every blade to those kind of dimensions.  And unlike certain industries where you can sample inspect, once weíve got a metal part, every part goes through every inspectional operation.
[20:30:28] <d4wnr4z0r> BrokenCog: indeed
[20:30:44] <Skywise> tenths of a milimeter, i'd say thats perfect for anything outside of a science experiment
[20:31:10] <BrokenCog> unrelated ... i can hear the bearings on the GPU fan ...
[20:31:41] <nofra> Obviously, your bearings didn't go through every inspection...
[20:31:56] <pi31415> who needs a GPU anyway
[20:32:05] <Skywise> and regarding pilots/computer significance, theres 2 schools of thought, boeing and airbus are in opposite camps
[20:32:30] <Skywise> airbus is computer dominant and boeing is pilot dominant
[20:32:47] <BrokenCog> they were ... not so sure anymore, but i'm not tracking the details.
[20:32:50] <d4wnr4z0r> it would be silly to deny that the significance is changing; it definitely is.
[20:33:24] <Skywise> airbus has the computer flying with the pilot being a supervisor or director
[20:33:38] <d4wnr4z0r> and, realistically, my real world knowledge is somewhat out of date at this point, so I probably should stop relying on it.
[20:33:39] <Skywise> boeing has the pilot flying with the autopilot assisting
[20:33:43] <BrokenCog> it was less a phisilosphical difference and more a "thepy have" it "they don't" issue.
[20:34:34] <Skywise> i prefer boeing stance, because when the plane encounters an unanticipated situation it can work against or even thwart the flight crew
[20:34:35] <BrokenCog> Skywise: Boeing would have slapped their planes chock full of computers if they had been able to.
[20:34:51] <Skywise> they do have their planes full of computers
[20:35:06] <BrokenCog> Skywise: don't peddle movies here ... no airline pilot will be saving you by barrel rolling any time soon.
[20:35:21] <Skywise> um, what?

[20:36:02] <Skywise> because all the experts agree that an autopilot could not of done what sullenburger did on the hudson
[20:36:04] <d4wnr4z0r> that's a right choice. the problem is when the automation is not entirely complete, as is the case with flying, obviously.

[20:53:17] <d4wnr4z0r> but their naturals

[20:53:22] <Skywise> my keyboard is so old, the rubber stoppers have worn off and when i play an fps i'm chasing it across my desk
[20:53:22] <d4wnr4z0r> they last.
[20:53:28] <hackedhead> i had a logitech illuminated, but i killed it with gaming... soooo.

[21:04:55] <d4wnr4z0r> makes you a better typist, probably, having the split between

[21:11:30] <Skywise> you can tell which keys i use the most, my a key, not only is the label worn off the plastic is worn down
[21:11:55] <d4wnr4z0r> my m and n keys are losing their labels

[21:29:58] <ruskie> ananke, I've run and still do run multiple VPNs interconnected via BPG along with other stuff and of course I can't give up pf just makes stuff easy compared to iptables
[21:30:42] <ananke> yeah, netfilter is a pita. i do run just a single vpn for home, so that was never an issue for me
[21:30:51] <Skywise> iptables isn't easy, but you don't have to do all the heavy lifting yourself
[21:31:04] <ruskie> I like to understand what I'm doing
[21:31:06] <d4wnr4z0r> I don't even bother with vpn, an ssh gateway is really all I need.
[21:31:21] <Skywise> yeah, but theres lots of examples to pull from
[21:31:30] <ruskie> example != understanding
[21:31:31] <ruskie> hehe
[21:31:35] <d4wnr4z0r> indeed
[21:31:44] <Skywise> i think examples are key to understanding
[21:31:54] <d4wnr4z0r> they help, but they do not equal

[21:35:56] <ruskie> had 0 issues with either irc or ftp
[21:36:01] <d4wnr4z0r> someone wrote them, so someone needed that functionality at some point for something, but that someone ain't me
[21:36:21] <Skywise> ruskie, do you use dcc from behind a firewall?
[21:36:24] <ruskie> yup
[21:36:27] <ruskie> without a prob
[21:36:32] <pi31415> been years since i used dcc
[21:36:33] <ananke> ftp connection tracking is a must, if you do ftp. also tftp connection tracking is useful, if you're doing tftp over NAT
[21:37:03] <d4wnr4z0r> pretty much every firewall system these days is either aware of the non-behaving protocols, or can be made aware.
[21:37:39] <Skywise> sometimes they're forgotten
[21:38:58] <Skywise> with dcc, you have to change the ip in the packet as well as the header
[21:39:25] <ruskie> that's why irc clients tend to have an external ip setting

[21:39:49] <rachael> ventYl, did you say you had those 13.37 packages online somewhere yet ?
[21:40:24] <d4wnr4z0r> wtf does acoplate mean?
[21:40:31] <Iuz> bind them together in one file
[21:40:38] <d4wnr4z0r> cat?
[21:40:44] <Iuz> I mean, bind the subtitles to the avi
[21:41:20] <ananke> Iuz: most video players can use separate subtitles. no need to burn them in
[21:41:29] <d4wnr4z0r> I don't know this for fact, but I'd be willing to bet that mplayer or one of its programs can do that
[21:41:43] <ananke> Iuz: because that's your only option. you can't 'attach' subtitles to avi containers.
[21:41:56] <ananke> d4wnr4z0r: mplayer can, so can vlc
[21:42:42] <d4wnr4z0r> well, as far as external subtitles are concerned, most can do. but whatever 'attachment' can be done mplayer can probably do
[21:43:17] <d4wnr4z0r> vlc is the only thing I use for video playing, personally

[21:57:29] <eviljames> I do see value in the added bonus features, if there are any, that can't fit on a DVD or whatever.  Or having a marathon of movies on a single disc (LOTR all day!)

[22:02:32] <eviljames> I think we had this talk the other day.  To the trained ear, and on the right equipment, low bitrate mp3s sound horrid
[22:02:33] <d4wnr4z0r> I guess if I had to specify a drum sound it'd be the snares
[22:02:50] <eviljames> untrained ear, cheap speakers/headphones - they can't tell and don't care heh
[22:02:54] <ruskie> mp3s sound horrid... simple as that
[22:02:59] <d4wnr4z0r> eviljames: we did indeed
[22:03:25] <d4wnr4z0r> eviljames: but some of us don't really know our ears are trained, we've just always been able to hear the diff
[22:04:05] <Skywise> you don't need training to notice the difference, just to describe what the difference is
[22:04:08] <eviljames> People who've been around the block and remember downloading 96kbit mp3s from Napster certainly know :P
[22:04:14] <Skywise> lol
[22:04:19] <d4wnr4z0r> shit
[22:04:22] <eviljames> "Man, 128 takes too long to download..."
[22:04:28] <d4wnr4z0r> I was downloading mp3s from IRC before napster even existed.
[22:04:30] <eviljames> "Why does it sound like I'm listening to AM radio all day?"
[22:04:35] <Skywise> i'd prefer am radio in a tunnel to 96k
[22:04:42] <ananke> ruskie: it's not simple as that. a decent 256k or 320k mp3 results in a very decent quality playback
[22:04:42] <eviljames> hahaha too true
[22:04:45] <pi31415> I can remember listening to music on AM radio that was worse than the 64kbit MP3 I download from ultimathule.info
[22:04:46] <d4wnr4z0r> back when the *only way* to get mp3s was via irc.
[22:04:50] <rachael> was a good program though :) could chat with peopel with the music
[22:05:25] <ruskie> ananke, to me it results in bearable quality
[22:05:27] <d4wnr4z0r> and 128k was a minimum even back then.
[22:05:36] <Skywise> speech you can prolly get away with 32k, but 64k for music is a waste of space and time
[22:05:49] <ananke> ruskie: not so for most people.
[22:05:53] <eviljames> d4wnr4z0r: Most groups would refuse anything less than 128k.. and finding a group that released 192 was gold.

[22:05:57] <slacktivist> usenet wasn't in on the MP3 game the same time as IRC?

[22:06:25] <eviljames> d4wnr4z0r: I meant the ones on irc.
[22:06:27] <d4wnr4z0r> eviljames: by the time I was off downloading via IRC, soulseek was around
[22:06:33] <d4wnr4z0r> oh, right
[22:06:34] Action: ruskie has flac where he can... ogg q6+ where flac isn't available and mp3 only on stuff that he can't get in other formats
[22:06:45] <Skywise> usenet usually has higher quality files cause the sender doesn't have to sacrifice their bandwidth, but you can't always find what you want when you want it on usenet
[22:06:48] <d4wnr4z0r> hence why I said 128k was a minimum :)
[22:07:40] <Skywise> recent stuff is usually plentiful, but if you're trying to fill in a collection, then it gets sketchy
[22:07:45] <d4wnr4z0r> back then, when mp3s were new and fresh, I really couldn't tell the diff
[22:07:55] <eviljames> ...and since then you've trained your ear ;)

[22:29:35] <d4wnr4z0r> just because google can do a thing does not mean any sane person actually gives two shits about it.
[22:29:42] <Skywise> he doesn't understand how to change his username, so he's never getting past that filter
[22:30:59] <Skywise> i just wonder what its going to be like when everyone's device has ipv6 enable by default and gets crawled and no one even knows
[22:31:42] <Skywise> i mean most kids would just say they're not hiding anything or just blow it off
[22:31:43] <d4wnr4z0r> same as now. a bunch of morons running shit they ain't got the knowledge to run.

[22:35:16] <Skywise> you see the fcc is considering more spectrum for wifi now? for 802.11ac
[22:36:20] <Skywise> its at 5ghz so it will be less able to penetrate walls and might lower the noise floor from neighbors

[22:37:48] Action: KeshlWare looks over at N networks that have been around for years, that use exclusively 5 ghz.

[22:43:18] <BrokenCog> sample man page fail:
[22:43:26] <BrokenCog>  Least one of parameter -delay, -active, -cmd, -duration or -shutdown is necessary, but on only one
[22:44:03] <BrokenCog> this one's good:   The parameter -pwrfail and -lowbatt are exclusively.
