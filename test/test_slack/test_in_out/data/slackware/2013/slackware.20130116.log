[01:06:21] <keepishop> Give / small inodes, and /home bigger inodes
[01:06:38] <keepishop> Put /var on a separate physical drive if you can.
[01:06:54] <keepishop> Add more ram (for caching)
[01:06:58] <Rat409> use a window-manager vs xfce4 or kde can still use eithers global settings daemon for globals
[01:07:12] <keepishop> fluxbox
[01:07:17] <keepishop> Cant beat it for speed
[01:07:26] <solez> use SSD. :D
[01:07:32] <keepishop> lxde is a nice middleground to gnome
[01:07:58] <Jdogzz> _LuseR_: I'm working on it:) I want to take plenty of time when I make my own.
[01:08:08] <_LuseR_> :)
[01:08:22] <Jdogzz> keepishop: Is there a specific guide I can read about the changing of the inodes? That's new to me.
[01:08:40] <Jdogzz> As to the window manager, I currently use Fluxbox so that's a good sign.
[01:08:59] <keepishop> Jdogzz: Uh, not sure
[01:09:11] <keepishop> I guess go look at filesystem tuning guides
[01:09:53] <_LuseR_> the second idea is what you told Jdogzz .... disable starup services...
[01:09:57] <Jdogzz> Is there a filesystem that you recommend above etx4? I always stuck with that one since it's the default and everytime I see the word reiser I get mixed feelings of thrill and panic.
[01:10:02] <Jdogzz> *ext4
[01:10:28] <_LuseR_> Jdogzz, perhaps ext3
[01:11:17] <keepishop> ext2
[01:11:22] <keepishop> It's fast
[01:11:32] <solez> i feel ext4 is faster here. although you can mount it with option like no barrier, no writeback journal. But, it will increase FS corruption on power failure.
[01:11:45] <solez> that for speed increase.
[01:11:45] <keepishop> I only use ext2 for slow computers myself
[01:12:04] <keepishop> ext3 with the noatime option is pretty quick
[01:12:14] <keepishop> I use it for SSDs
[01:12:21] <keepishop> ext4 is too buggy
[01:12:25] <_LuseR_> ext2 hasn't register...
[01:12:29] <solez> noatime on ext4 works too.
[01:12:30] <keepishop> (and I'm tired of people telling me it's stable)
[01:12:55] <solez> ext4 buggy ? seriously ?
[01:13:05] <keepishop> There was a bug reopened in 3.6
[01:13:12] <keepishop> It's closed now, but still.
[01:13:20] <solez> O_o
[01:13:21] <keepishop> This should have been solid a long time ago
[01:13:24] <solez> link please ?
[01:13:28] <solez> yeah. indeed.

[06:25:59] <shonudo> hello all
[06:27:07] <MLanden> heya shonudo
[06:27:14] <shonudo> hey MLanden
[06:31:30] <consfearacy> can you watch youtube videos on mplayer in the console?
[06:35:32] <TommyC> I think you can. You can with VLC.
[06:35:56] <shonudo> you can do anything with vlc
[06:36:03] <shonudo> vlc and emacs and you're set for life
[06:37:14] <TommyC> I should try out MPlayer. Never used it before. Opened it once, but never actually used it. :/
[06:37:32] <shonudo> it's pretty nice
[06:37:37] <shonudo> do you still have it installed?
[06:38:03] <TommyC> Nah, not anymore.
[06:39:01] <shonudo> nifty app, nifty browser plugins too
[06:39:38] <Jdogzz> SMPlayer makes for a handy frontend, lets you access all sorts of options.
[06:39:52] <Jdogzz> Not to mention it has the bookmarking ability (VLC doesn't have that yet).

[06:46:14] <TommyC> I added some additional dependencies to VLC and took off some, can't recall what they were but I remember I did it to get like every possible audio and video format out there.
[06:46:40] <shonudo> that's the idea
[06:46:55] <TommyC> hehe, yeah
[06:47:15] <Jdogzz> I hope you got bluray working:)
[06:47:36] <Jdogzz> That's the one thing I never could get to work tolerably well in it, massive lag on every movie.
[06:47:38] <shonudo> people still use bluray? (:P)
[06:47:48] <consfearacy> does vlc work on console?
[06:47:52] <TommyC> yes
[06:47:55] <consfearacy> ok ty
[06:48:13] <TommyC> and VLC's documented some example usage for the console too.
[06:48:18] <Jdogzz> The big companies are milking out every dollar they can before people realize bluray is getting replaced fast.
[06:48:40] <consfearacy> vlc is not in slackpkg is it?
[06:48:48] <shonudo> don't think it is
[06:48:56] <shonudo> SBo
[06:48:59] <shonudo> it's there
[06:49:01] <shonudo> source
[06:49:10] <TommyC> VLC isn't included with Slackware, so slackpkg won't pick it up.
[06:49:16] <shonudo> and more dependents than a tax cheat
[06:49:46] <TommyC> eh, many are optional
[06:49:57] <TommyC> since they're just audio/visual support for VLC
[06:50:00] <shonudo> i can never bring myself not to build all of them
[06:50:28] <consfearacy> ok it is on slackbuilds... how do we install those? there is build/ pkg/ and pkg64/
[06:51:08] <shonudo> do you see the thing on the page that says "HOW TO"?
[06:51:22] <shonudo> that's how
[06:51:30] <TommyC> How to read how to, though? :(
[06:51:32] <Jdogzz> That's half of the fun of using Slackware:)
[06:51:36] <shonudo> lol
[06:52:01] <consfearacy> hmm, emacs requires libMagickWand..
[06:57:48] <consfearacy> i never used emacs before
[06:58:05] <consfearacy> you can even use it a web browser they say?
[07:01:57] <pink_mist> as they say: emacs is a great OS, the only thing it lacks is a decent editor
[07:03:07] <j4son> emacs is great for looking 10x as busy as you actually are
[07:03:17] <j4son> simple edit?  sure... that'll be 10 keystrokes
[07:03:29] <pink_mist> at once
[07:03:35] <consfearacy> i am used to using joe for editor

[08:10:39] <cmyster> indeed
[08:11:01] <cmyster> but a fb browser that can format css is something I was looked for
[08:11:06] <Urchlay> hmmm, video playback, wonder if that works with youtube's html5 stuff. That would be hilarious.
[08:11:31] <ewong> for http://phra.gs/rules/  I'm getting Not found
[08:12:46] <Urchlay> about the only weirdnesses when using the browser: there's no blinking text cursor (so when you click on the URL bar or a text input, you don't get any visual indication). And unlike every browser I've ever used, it doesn't use the space bar to scroll the page down (but the pagedown key works)
[08:13:25] <Urchlay> no idea if it support scrollwheel mice, I'm using it with a laptop touchpad for now
[08:13:43] <ewong> oh.. http://phra.gs/rules  is ok..  don't need the extra /
[08:14:05] <Urchlay> ewong: yah, the URL in the /topic is wrong for some reason
[08:14:20] <Urchlay> I dunno, maybe it's supposed to be an IQ test?

[09:06:32] <cmyster> Urchlay: I'll let you know, but I won't work on it today probably
[09:07:02] <Urchlay> yah, it's probably more of a novelty than anything else
[09:07:49] <Urchlay> I keep trying to see how much useful graphical stuff I can run without X... but the answer seems to be "not bloody much"
[09:08:35] <cmyster> nope :)
[09:09:17] <Urchlay> although I found not one but two working PDF viewers... and the SDL_vncviewer that ships with slackware works on the console
[09:09:30] <cmyster> well, I use slack on my work laptop and I get mails from outlook with embedded ms office items and I need to test stuff on "real" browsers so I can't drop X altogether,

[09:13:32] <Urchlay> qemu might work, except it crashes if the guest OS tries to change resolution above what the framebuffer supports (instead of doing like you'd expect, returning an error to the guest)

[11:30:44] <KaMii> and those are cheap then, 4 for 900
[11:30:53] <ventYl> FrankD: what do you use it for?
[11:31:00] <FrankD> for playing 12 EveO clients at a time
[11:31:10] <systemd_suxX> KaMii, me not but there are people who need it, especially if you do 3d rendering or modelling
[11:31:10] <fuzzix> Which, for jitter free audio buffering, includes 96G RAM and a couple top end video cards so the Windows instance doesn't interfere with the audio.

[12:19:11] <ventYl> i didn't checked what he smells like
[12:19:27] <ventYl> as didn't examined his genitals
[12:19:36] <KaMii> that would suck to sound like a 12yo girl if your a boy

[12:19:49] <KaMii> yea, maybe its a he-she
[12:19:57] <d4wnr4z0r> happens to all boys
[12:20:00] <ventYl> KaMii: even more if you're more than 12yo old boy
[12:20:01] <d4wnr4z0r> then puberty hits
[12:20:10] <KaMii> well you know what i meant
[12:20:34] <KaMii> like if he has a job selling cellphones, then he should be old enough to have a deep voice
[12:21:03] <ventYl> i bought it as used. he was just it's previous user

[12:21:41] <KaMii> you bought a girls phone?

[12:22:40] <d4wnr4z0r> or april? or sherry? or peaches?
[12:22:47] <KaMii> was there facial hair?
[12:22:49] <ventYl> nope, here we have not many he-she names
[12:23:02] <d4wnr4z0r> facial hair is not always a good indicator...

[12:26:14] <KaMii> poor boy
[12:26:25] <KaMii> are you sure it was a boy?
[12:27:44] <ventYl> yep. he looked and was dressed definitely like boy. just his voice was too high, unnatural also for girl
[12:28:15] <TheM4ch1n3> maybe someone was squeezing hes ballz
[12:28:38] <ventYl> maybe he forget his balls somewhere
[12:28:44] <ventYl> :D
[12:28:47] <TheM4ch1n3> haha
[12:29:07] <KaMii> maybe he was breathing helium

[16:01:33] <BrokenCog> Well, it's either that or QT ... I'd prefer ML.
[16:02:43] <d4wnr4z0r> the two also get along quite well together :)
[16:03:16] <BrokenCog> yes.  I mean either install QT to get PDFedit working, or ML to use acrocread ...  neither is particuraly quick.
[16:03:33] <d4wnr4z0r> that's true. though installing qt is probably quicker
[16:03:55] <d4wnr4z0r> s/probably/certainly
[16:04:09] <Skywise> easier to remove if you don't like it as well
[16:05:45] <Urchlay> actually... according to the pdfedit link you pasted in here, there's a qt4 editor that uses the library. Source available, no idea if it builds on anything but windows tho
[16:06:19] <Urchlay> (I assume it's qt3 you specifically don't want to install)
[16:06:31] <Skywise> the libraries build on linux, i'd assume the rest did as well
[16:07:21] <BrokenCog> i tried compiling the source ... didn't try the binary yet.
[16:07:23] <Urchlay> the editor app included with the lib is qt3... the one I'm wondering about is qt4, they offer a windows binary
[16:08:03] <Urchlay> (and source, see if you can compile that?)
[16:08:31] <BrokenCog> tried ... wants QT

[17:28:15] <TheM4ch1n3> DKun: you could .., use a chroot
[17:28:20] <Urchlay> not gonna work. If you tried to do it all at once, slackpkg would die when glibc-solibs got updated (pretty early on in the process) and you'd find yourself with a box where even commands like ls won't work
[17:28:34] <TheM4ch1n3> DKun: but you really have to know what you are doing
[17:28:42] <TheM4ch1n3> DKun: I would never suggest doing that to a noob
[17:28:53] <BrokenCog> Urchlay: he could update glibc first, singly I think that would work.
[17:29:09] <Urchlay> no, because the new glibc will be 64-bit, which won't run on his 32-bit kernel
[17:29:19] <BrokenCog> ah, right.
[17:29:26] <TheM4ch1n3> yeah, a fresh install is much safer, then migrate /home /etc /var /tmp stuff
[17:29:27] <BrokenCog> he'd need reverse multilib
[17:29:27] <Urchlay> (plus it's in /lib64, the one in /lib will get removed!)
[17:29:31] necropresto (~necropres@unaffiliated/necropresto) joined ##slackware.
[17:29:47] <BrokenCog> yeah.  easier rm -rf
[17:30:28] <DKun> I was thinking I was going to have to do a full wipe. I don't have a problem doing that on my desktop because I have multiple drives, but my server only has one. It will be hard to find storage for everything
[17:30:44] <eviljames> Urchlay: slackpkg and pkgtools both have ROOT= options
[17:30:49] <eviljames> or, they did at one time.
[17:31:07] <BrokenCog> DKun: partitionmanager, create boot partition, install new.
[17:31:10] kkady32 (~matrix@unaffiliated/kkady32) joined ##slackware.
[17:31:16] <Urchlay> eviljames: yeah, but he's talking about doing it on his existing partitions
[17:31:24] <eviljames> So, hypothetically, you /can/ install w/o a chroot environment.
[17:31:25] <Urchlay> *partition*, singular, probably
[17:32:06] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: root=   :p
[17:32:07] <BrokenCog> DKun: or, buy a new SSD for your new machine, install OS, mount drives in /home etc.
[17:32:16] <Urchlay> yeah, but if you don't set ROOT= to the mount point of a real partition, you end up with a hard-to-boot system (the new root of the fs will just be a subdirectory of the old one)
[17:33:07] <Urchlay> DKun: I can think of a couple approaches for upgrading 32-bit to 64-bit without doing a complete reinstall, but they all require you to know a lot of fiddly details
[17:33:16] <DKun> I don't really have that much on my server. Mostly videos that I already have archived
[17:33:25] <Urchlay> if you're not a fiddly-detail type, you're better off with a clean wipe & reinstall
[17:33:55] <DKun> I do enjoy fiddly stuff, but when it's a server, I want as little down time as possible
[17:34:04] zakame (~zakame@ubuntu/member/zakame) left irc: Ping timeout: 246 seconds
[17:34:09] <BrokenCog> DKun: then all this is academic - install/wipe, restore.
[17:34:48] <Urchlay> yeah... but what I'm saying really is, you'd have to *know* what you're doing. I won't try to talk you through it (for one thing, I might make a mistake... or I might have to leave before you're done...)
[17:34:50] <DKun> I was planning on a wipe/install process. I was mostly just wondering
[17:35:05] <iron_houzi> Is there an easy way to check which packages are affected by a given dependency?
[17:35:31] <DKun> I wouldn't plan on coming in here and asking someone to hold my hand. I've been working with Slack long enough to know what I'm doing, but I just recently got into using tools like slackpkg
[17:35:31] <Urchlay> iron_houzi: some checking with ldd might help
[17:35:34] karel (~karel@unaffiliated/karel) left irc: Quit: Lost terminal
[17:36:23] <Urchlay> DKun: slackpkg is convenient but it only covers the simple cases... upgrading 32- to 64-bit in place is definitely not simple
[17:37:11] <iron_houzi> What does it mean when ldd returns: not a dynamic executable ??
[17:37:19] <DKun> I figured as much. Honestly, I'm just looking forward to diving into Slack64. Only my old laptop would still be running 32bit
[17:37:19] <Urchlay> means what it says
[17:37:34] <Urchlay> probably it's a shell/perl/python/something script, instead of a binary
[17:37:36] <iron_houzi> Urchlay: that's very profound
[17:37:52] <Urchlay> or, it might be a static binary (there aren't many of those on slackware though)
[17:37:58] <Urchlay> use "file" to find out which
[17:38:59] Buumi (~buumi@dsl-vsabrasgw1-54fb61-71.dhcp.inet.fi) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[17:39:06] <DKun> I just want to take advantage of the 8GB of ram I'm going to have. Plus my new desktop will have a 2gb video card (overkill, but it has dual DVI, unlike the motherboard)
[17:39:17] <iron_houzi> OK - file json-c* gives me: Quake I or II world extension   --- wtf?!
[17:39:24] <Urchlay> "dynamic executable" means "executable which depends on shared libraries"... which is what ldd is for (finding out what libs a dynamic exe uses). If it's not a dynamic exe (if it's a script or static bin), ldd doesn't try to tell you what it actually is... so, make sense now?
[17:39:48] <Urchlay> heh. file isn't perfect. What does the file looks like if you run less on it?
[17:39:57] <Urchlay> (probably a text file, a script)
[17:41:25] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: oops sorry
[17:41:29] <iron_houzi> Urchlay: It's an install script
[17:41:37] <Urchlay> right. So ldd can't do anything with it
[17:41:40] <TheM4ch1n3> eviljames: export ROOT=     ;p
[17:43:21] Buumi (~buumi@dsl-vsabrasgw1-54fb61-71.dhcp.inet.fi) joined ##slackware.
[17:43:40] <iron_houzi> So there's no command that will list all packages that depends on the json-c library?
[17:45:05] <Urchlay> sort-of. You can do a quick-n-dirty ldd of all your binaries, with a script like this one: http://dpaste.com/879180/
[17:46:00] mikef (~mike@140.105.36.207) joined ##slackware.
[17:47:06] <Urchlay> but there's no simple command built into slackware that does the job, no. It would have to be done by a package manager, and the slackware package manager doesn't do dependencies
[17:47:54] <iron_houzi> Urchlay: Then how do I know if upgrading a package will break dependencies or not?
[17:48:07] <Urchlay> upgrade it and see what breaks, is one approach
[17:48:23] <eviljames> We call this "The ubuntu method"
[17:48:29] <Jdogzz> lol
[17:48:31] <DKun> HA!
[17:48:36] <Urchlay> upgrade it and see what breaks, *on a testbed server*, is a better approach
[17:48:43] <iron_houzi> Sure - how do I keep a backup of the old package when the tgz file is missing?
[17:48:44] <eviljames> That's called "The Arch method"
[17:48:57] <Urchlay> upgradepkg has an option for that...
[17:49:04] <eviljames> It does?
[17:49:08] <Urchlay> sorry, removepkg does

[17:50:53] <Urchlay> so instead of upgradepkg, you'd removepkg -preserve pkgname, followed by installpkg the-new-package

[18:39:42] <DKun> Thanks FrankD. I talked to a friend who suggested I just get another drive to use as the host. I'm going to be virtualizing many of my services, so I'm not concerned about RAID (the 2 drives I have currently are mirrored)

[18:43:32] <FrankD> DKun, theres a few ways around that, but using another drive isn't a bad idea; another alternative would be to wipe all the 'big' directories (leave /var and /etc) and then repartition the drive with gparted, would leave all your data and configs intact, then just copy whatever you need from /var and /etc after the install
[18:43:42] <FrankD> hell id boot off a USB stick ;)
[18:44:26] <thumbs> using gparted without making a real backup is risky
[18:44:33] <DKun> While I could use gparted, I've never used it on a production system (or without backing up the data first) that's running a raided system
[18:44:52] <FrankD> well.. your data should be backed up anyway, amirite? :)
[18:44:56] <thumbs> I don't recommend running it without backups.
[18:45:26] <DKun> That's why I raid
[18:45:52] <FrankD> you could always try a PAE kernel
[18:45:53] <thumbs> DKun: RAID is not a backup.
[18:45:53] <DKun> I know it's not the best backup solution, but it works well for me. I always backup important things

[22:22:02] <dvhfm> Skywise: installed it directly via sbopkg or sycamorex's build from slackword, same issue
[22:22:07] <KaMii> dvhfm: before you go and do all that, were you using the slackbuild?
[22:22:16] <dvhfm> KaMii: sure
[22:22:41] <KaMii> well so you installed it?
[22:22:45] <KaMii> so whats the problem?
[22:22:46] <dvhfm> ?
[22:22:51] <Skywise> have you googled it?
[22:22:58] <Nh3xus> dvhfm : Here's an how to for that install : http://docs.slackware.com/howtos:window_managers:i3wm
[22:22:58] <dvhfm> Skywise: sure
[22:23:07] <KaMii> hes probably missing some dependencies
[22:23:20] <KaMii> all dependencies are found in the .info file now
[22:23:27] <dvhfm> nope, installed libev, yajl and dmenu
[22:23:46] <dvhfm> btw, what is this "Broken Pipe" thingy
[22:23:53] <TheM4ch1n3> lol
[22:23:56] <Nh3xus> On slack the How-To says that you have to disable the  pango support. Maybe that's your error.
[22:24:17] <dvhfm> Nh3xus: it's done by the slackbuild of sycamorex (slackword)
[22:24:35] <TheM4ch1n3> dvhfm: one of the compiler stages stopping
[22:24:39] <dvhfm> Maybe my compiler-settin is faulty
[22:24:54] <KaMii> try using make -j1

[22:25:33] <Nh3xus> dvhfm : Have you built i3status and confuse from SBo ? It looks like those are needed
[22:25:48] <KaMii> i3status is not needed, but recomended
[22:26:25] <Nh3xus> KaMii : For a beginner in Tiling WM what should i give a try ? Awesome ?
[22:26:36] <dvhfm> KaMii: used i3 before
[22:26:39] <KaMii> awesome.... blah
[22:26:52] <KaMii> Nh3xus: i was just pasting what was written in the readme
[22:27:15] <TheM4ch1n3> KaMii: next time, just say, read the README
[22:27:23] <dvhfm> -j1 didn't do it
[22:27:23] <KaMii> dvhfm: the sbo is old, download version 4.4 and try that one
[22:27:36] <dvhfm> KaMii: same thing
[22:27:42] <dvhfm> something is odd around

[22:38:19] <Urchlay> hr. Does anyone remember under what circumstances a shell script will run without the user's $HOME variable set?
[22:38:50] <nofra> Urchlay: nope
[22:38:58] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: heh, what kind of question is that, do a grep HOME shellscript.sh
[22:39:02] <nofra> TheM4ch1n3: Innertubes are too chewy for me
[22:39:11] <Urchlay> yah, me either. I know I've had it happen before, can't remember
[22:39:30] <Urchlay> TheM4ch1n3: eh, this is a hypothetical script that hasn't been written yet. Hard to grep the future.
[22:40:00] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: well if it uses $HOME , and home is not/badly set, there is no telling what it would do 'sorta'
[22:40:21] <Urchlay> no, no, I don't want to know "what will happen to this script if $HOME is not set"
[22:40:42] <Urchlay> I want to know "in what way can the user or system get screwed up so shell scripts ever get run without $HOME set"

[22:41:20] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: um
[22:41:53] <Urchlay> if it's something that almost never happens, I won't worry about it. But if e.g. users of some particular shell or something, always get my script bailing because $HOME isn't set, that's a problem
[22:42:03] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: killing /etc/profile and /etc/profile.d/
[22:42:28] <Urchlay> yeah, in that case, the system is screwed up badly, my script wouldn't need special code to detect that
[22:42:46] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: are you just trying to manually set HOME in the script ?
[22:42:50] <Urchlay> no
[22:42:59] <KaMii> lol he got banned
[22:43:08] <Urchlay> I just want to abort the script if HOME isn't set
[22:43:10] <Urchlay> easy
[22:43:36] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: come to think of it, I am not sure where/when HOME is set ...
[22:43:40] <Urchlay> but, if there's some common circumstance (that I don't know about) that causes HOME not to be set, it'll annoy people
[22:44:04] <Urchlay> e.g. maybe if you spawn a shell from within $some_fancy_editor, it doesn't set HOME
[22:44:17] <KaMii> like emacs?
[22:44:27] <Urchlay> yeah, eh, I was trying to avoid the E word
[22:44:55] <KaMii> but i like it
[22:44:56] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: oh, well if you are a user and you "su" instead of "su -" your HOME will be wrong
[22:45:03] <Urchlay> besides, I seriously doubt that would happen in emacs, it's very unix-smart
[22:45:28] <KaMii> what other editor can spawn a shell?
[22:45:39] <TheM4ch1n3> KaMii: vim
[22:45:41] <KaMii> nano cant, notepad.exe cant,
[22:45:42] <Urchlay> TheM4ch1n3: yeah, that I remember happening before. This script won't need to be run as root necessarily
[22:45:45] <KaMii> isnt vim smart?
[22:45:56] <Urchlay> any vi variant (elvis too)
[22:45:57] <KaMii> can kate spawn a shell?
[22:46:03] <TheM4ch1n3> KaMii: sorta
[22:46:21] <TheM4ch1n3> KaMii: depends if the user is smart, regex's
[22:46:21] <KaMii> if i used kde i would probably switch to kate
[22:47:23] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: are you writing a super bash trojan using HOME in some way ?   ;p
[22:47:37] <Urchlay> lots of console stuff can spawn a shell. mutt can, so can plain old ftp

[22:48:14] <TheM4ch1n3> sometimes the right data to a printf() will do it too, dunno if libc is patched against that ..
[22:48:30] <Urchlay> no, I just want to store a temp file at $HOME/.scriptname/filename, and I can't remember whether I ever decided it's safe to always rely on $HOME being set
[22:49:05] <nofra> An editor spawning a shell????  WHA????
[22:49:11] <Urchlay> sorry, not a temp file (that would go in /tmp somewhere), a cache file that needs to still be there next time the script runs.
[22:49:17] <nofra> WHy would you want an editor to spawn a shell?
[22:49:37] <TheM4ch1n3> Urchlay: well using whoami and such, checking for whoami == root, is a way to implement a HOME manually
[22:49:47] ridout (~coffee@unaffiliated/ridout) joined ##slackware.
[22:50:01] <Urchlay> nofra: in the case of emacs, because it does everything else, so why not also a shell? (seriously, an emacs expert might prefer to run a shell inside emacs if he's already dealing with emacs 24/7)
[22:50:10] <TheM4ch1n3> nofra: too many reasons, mainly because shells are cool!
[22:50:29] Action: nofra hands TheM4ch1n3 a conch
[22:50:46] <Urchlay> nofra: vim's ability to spawn a shell usually isn't used interactively. Usually you use it to send selected text through a shell pipeline

[22:53:16] <Jdogzz> lol
[22:53:20] <nofra> Can I get a certificate of that?
[22:53:34] <pink_mist> "!sort"? wouldn't that be "shuffle"? :P
[22:53:38] <Urchlay> nofra: that's horrid. Don't exit the editor while you're debugging (you lose the ability to undo, if your latest change breaks something)
[22:53:49] <TheM4ch1n3> nofra: all out, I don't print that many
[22:53:54] <nofra> Urchlay: Not exit, switch screens

[23:05:29] <xocel> I dont think you need to specify -t iso9660 anymore either. mount seems to figure it out.
[23:05:31] Action: TheM4ch1n3 hugs KaMii 
[23:05:39] <TheM4ch1n3> loll

[23:12:28] <wood_quinn> No my personal data partition.
[23:12:31] <TheM4ch1n3> wood_quinn: or /home/wood_quinn   or /tmp/   or /var/log/  ,, or /home/wood_quinn/porn/ ?
[23:13:38] <TheM4ch1n3> sounds like you must rediscover the ancient art of deleting stuff
[23:13:41] <Urchlay> well anyway. Easy enough to make the script bail if $HOME not set. Probably nobody but me will ever run it anyway...
[23:14:17] <Urchlay> attempting to set HOME manually would be a mistake
[23:14:37] <wood_quinn> I was downloading two torrents.
[23:15:04] <wood_quinn> I thought I had deselected about 10GBs of stuff from the first one, but I hadn't.
[23:16:06] <TheM4ch1n3> wood_quinn: how much space was left the last time you checked ?
[23:16:41] <wood_quinn> About 5GB.

[23:17:42] <TheM4ch1n3> ah, that is why it filled up ;)
[23:18:22] <TheM4ch1n3> I got 45GB free, while I am going around 100k/s
[23:19:00] <TheM4ch1n3> I still have to delete more stuff, I want >100gb free there ...
[23:19:01] <wood_quinn> I actually have another partition with 35GB free.
[23:19:09] <wood_quinn> I'm just not using it right now.
