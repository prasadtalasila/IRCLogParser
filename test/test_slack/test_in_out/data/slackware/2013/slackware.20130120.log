[07:32:38] <xocel> wouldn't mind some of that cold :P
[07:32:46] <Skywise> well, you guys picked the wrong part of the orbit to be close to the sun
[07:34:05] <Skywise> its easier to warm up then it is to cool down, but i still like summer better
[07:35:17] <td0s> Why can't the earth oscillate more frequently

[07:37:21] <Skywise> spring and fall are my favorite seasons and i think i prefer spring overall
[07:37:21] <xocel> uv exposure + heat results my immune system misbehaving. Not much fun. cold is a lot better
[07:37:41] <Skywise> you can stay inside in the summer too
[07:37:44] <wood_quinn> Well get out of the microwave!
[07:37:56] <Skywise> the sun is good for you in moderation
[07:38:22] <Skywise> its makes vitamin d
[07:38:59] <Skywise> but i'm miserable when its hot and muggy out
[07:39:00] <xocel> haha i take vit-d supplements and avoid the sun like its the plague :P
[07:39:14] <Skywise> that is one way to get it
[07:39:55] <Skywise> i think suntanning is just begging for trouble, but being in the sun in the cooler parts of the day is healty
[07:40:15] <Skywise> and wear sun screen
[07:41:01] <Skywise> practically anything you put on your skin has an spf anyway now
[07:41:44] <xocel> skin cancer is a fairly major problem here also, due to the hole in the ozone layer. I think its recommended to get about 20mins of sun exposure a day for healthy vit d levels. But more than enough to burn you here :/
[07:41:57] <xocel> bet thats*
[07:42:08] <xocel> but* -_-
[07:42:29] <Skywise> 20 mins should be ok, 2hrs is supposed to be the max exposure when tanning
[07:43:09] <td0s> That's per year right?
[07:43:10] <Skywise> but if you're going boating or something you're gonna be in the sun for a lot longer then that
[07:43:34] <Skywise> 2hrs per year would be pretty hard to swing if you live on the surface of the planet

[07:59:12] <Skywise> Cultist, you might wanna bookmark it this time
[07:59:37] <Cultist> already done
[08:01:45] <Cultist> the two things I needed Firefox for are no longer applicable
[08:01:50] <Cultist> so I can at last switch 100% to Chromium
[08:02:20] <wood_quinn> I need Firefox because I'm unwilling to use Chrom* or KDE software.
[08:02:47] <wood_quinn> Or some browser with 100 users.
[08:03:04] <Cultist> I needed it for a specific proxy addon, and because I couldn't figure out how to load government certificates into Chromium
[08:04:15] <Skywise> can't you load them into the system wide certs and it will use it
[08:05:16] <wood_quinn> What is your government certifying that the rest of the internet infrastructure won't?
[08:05:23] <Cultist> well the problem was obtaining them. Ordinarily you would go to a certain site that downloaded them directly, which wasn't usable with Chromium
[08:05:42] <wood_quinn> And why is "won't" the conjunction for will not?
[08:06:14] <Cultist> wood_quinn, US government websites use their own certifications, so if they're not loaded you have to run through a warning screen every time you move pages
[08:06:22] <Cultist> which is a big PITA
[08:07:26] <Skywise> yeah, its cute how browsers try to spread fud about that
[08:07:33] <Cultist> (I have to use such sites fairly frequently due to work)
[08:08:17] <wood_quinn> Holy shit man! The connection to this site is encrypted as hell, but it's not secure because I don't know who I'm encrypting to!!!
[08:08:18] <Skywise> when it complains, doesn't it give you the option to accept or manage certs?
[08:08:22] kkady32 (~matrix@unaffiliated/kkady32) joined ##slackware.
[08:08:46] <Cultist> it does, but it never seems willing to remember my exception policy
[08:08:54] <wood_quinn> Hope <someday> <someone> comes up with an alternative framework that seperates identification and encryption.
[08:08:57] <Skywise> yeah, encryption should be one thing and identification another
[08:09:03] <Skywise> jinx
[08:09:34] <Cultist> also, certificates* not certifications*
[08:09:36] <Cultist> just caught that
[08:09:44] <Skywise> could it be possible its only allowing it for the current session, maybe from a privacy setting?
[08:11:13] <Cultist> possibly
[08:11:25] <wood_quinn> I like ssh's way of warning you about fingerprints.
[08:11:26] <Skywise> or maybe it doesn't have write access to where its keeping track of such things
[08:11:29] <Cultist> but that shouldn't be default behavior, and I've seen it onmore than just one computer
[08:11:32] <wood_quinn> An inocuous one-liner.
[08:11:46] <Skywise> yeah, if only you could remember fingerprints to be sure
[08:11:46] <wood_quinn> Even that would be an improvement.

[08:20:17] <cmyster> idk if its a slackware thing, but slackpkg file-search will know if it is
[08:20:21] <Skywise> i'll see if my ssh clients even support it
[08:20:22] <wood_quinn> Even though that does nothing to prevent MITM attacks.
[08:20:40] <Skywise> yeah, i'm sure they'd make everything in agreement
[08:20:59] <Cultist> wait there it is
[08:21:05] <Skywise> oh i see it too
[08:21:11] <Skywise> grab it
[08:21:57] <cmyster> wood_quinn: I think it might because if you change your location and try to login via ssh it will tell you that known_hosts has different info and it might be a mitm attack
[08:22:19] <wood_quinn> Well that'd only matter if the server changed location.
[08:22:27] <cmyster> yes
[08:22:39] <wood_quinn> And if it did, it wouldn't match known_hosts at all.
[08:22:47] <wood_quinn> So it'd just be a new server to verify.
[08:23:05] <cmyster> not if it has the same IP
[08:23:30] <cmyster> happens in my office a lot if I use static IP but move the server between lans
[08:23:55] <Cultist> did deb2tgz on the Debian package of it, now to see if that was good enough for Chromium
[08:24:46] <wood_quinn> cmyster: Then they should use hostnames, which known_hosts also supports.
[08:27:23] <cmyster> fqdns even, but it is how it is, and I don't mind it
[08:27:43] <cmyster> I just delete the row in my known hosts and retry

[10:58:15] <darwin> I misstated, but I thought I clarified what I wanted to do
[10:59:07] <Urchlay> ok... so you want to do what? remove execute bits from files, but not directories? change "-type d" to "-type f"

[19:27:53] <platyna> Which worked fine.
[19:28:04] <platyna> And I had no need to create any devices.
[19:28:21] <platyna> And making a special daemon to manage directory that is like 10 megs bigs is idiotic.
[19:28:39] <dvhfm> its not about size but flexibility imho

[20:17:57] <pprkut> bool: largely depends on your use case. There are some slackbuilds which require a couple GB of space
[20:18:23] <BrokenCog> bool: it's safe, just not efficient.
[20:18:26] <thumbs> I like the SBo cache, and rebuild some SBo's often.
[20:19:15] <thumbs> if you do, as well, you can tell sbopkg to not use /tmp/SBo
[20:19:19] <bool> i should probably put /var /home and /tmp on lvm
[20:19:26] <thumbs> in that case, you can wipe /tmp at your heart's content.

[20:41:19] <bool> and then I have a separate /data partition
[20:41:24] <thumbs> ok. Get a tiny SSD, then, because you won't need much space.
[20:41:50] <bool> thumbs, I will use my 60 GB
[20:42:54] <bool> root / and /usr will contain most of my user programs, so I guess 60GB is ok. I could have managed with 20 GB probably

[21:59:11] <bool> removed
[22:00:49] <bool> just an idea
[22:00:56] <dvhfm> its doable with udev and a usb-stick (with keyfile)

[22:03:53] <bool> could do that also
[22:04:24] <dvhfm> and then they will analyze the hdd and see that there is an encrypted partition, thus you have to provide the key :) (depends on laws of your country of course)
[22:04:25] <BrokenCog> they'll run a decrypter on your stomach.
[22:04:26] <n1x4> Ostruction of justice charge is BETTER than piracy charges here.. Definitely a smart move... Just encrypt your files and if they find it they will not be able to decrypt and charge you with Obstruction for not releasesing the key

[22:06:15] <BrokenCog> i think it was perjury in addition to other things - she said she "didn't remember it" ... I don't recall the details.
[22:06:23] <NyteOwl> charges would most likely be obstruction or contempt of court, if the bench issued an order to produce the key
[22:06:26] <BrokenCog> bool: she felt it was worse ...
[22:06:43] <NyteOwl> hard to prove perjury in an "I can't remmber"

[22:07:11] <BrokenCog> they may think you have anothre, but could never do anything about it.
[22:07:25] <BrokenCog> TrueCrypt fails in places w/out torture limits ...
[22:07:35] <dvhfm> BrokenCog: yep
[22:07:36] <n1x4> It all boils down to obstruction. Which is NOTHING compared to the 1-5yrs per pirated peice of s/w.
[22:07:58] <NyteOwl> all such schemes fail once you put coercion in the equation
[22:08:05] <BrokenCog> well, with TC I think you'd dodge even the obstruction - you did give the the key.
