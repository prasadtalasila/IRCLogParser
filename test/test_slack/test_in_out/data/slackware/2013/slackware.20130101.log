[00:56:58] <ravigehlot> TheM4ch1n3: Command line only...
[00:57:40] <poprocks> I'd be incredulous if I were told there was a better console IRC client than irssi... you might want to try EPIC5, though; it also comes with Slackware.
[00:57:46] <TheM4ch1n3> ravigehlot: ah, well with most things in life, you have learned the bitter experience that everything is in a name

[01:14:25] <cryptic0> I am just wondering if in this day and age, it makes sense to run your own email server.
[01:14:41] <cryptic0> I am considering gmail apps because its probably better serviced than free gmail.
[01:14:47] adamk (~user@unaffiliated/adamk) left irc: Ping timeout: 255 seconds
[01:14:49] <cryptic0> not to mention I can use my own domain
[01:15:04] <TommyC> It does, but if you do have an e-mail server, you might be able to host a web server too. On that web server, ask for some hosting companies or whatnot to pay for the server, and in turn you'll advertise their website on your server.
[01:15:23] <TommyC> Easy breezy free e-mail server.
[01:15:28] <cryptic0> TommyC: I already run my web server on linode.

[01:15:49] <TommyC> Is there not enough room for a mail server?
[01:15:52] <cryptic0> so its no additional expense for me to run a email server
[01:16:02] <Nh3xus> Instead of hosting those services at home, you can use dedicated server for that purpose
[01:16:12] <Nh3xus> my upload is too weak to do self hosting
[01:16:29] <cryptic0> Nh3xus: I am hosting on linode, not at home.
[01:16:36] <Skywise> email doesn't take any bandwidth
[01:17:01] <Nh3xus> I dunno, thanks for the tip
[01:17:13] <Nh3xus> but you have to care about running an antivirus on it
[01:17:17] <Nh3xus> for Windows users
[01:17:17] <cryptic0> If I hosted my own email server, I still plan to use gmail interface.
[01:17:44] <cryptic0> how to take care of spam is my biggest concern.
[01:18:00] <Skywise> use spamhaus
[01:18:26] <cryptic0> Skywise: I wonder what kind of implementation google uses.  They have excellent spam filter.
[01:18:29] <Nh3xus> use Honeypot Project ?
[01:18:50] <Skywise> i don't think google shares their spam filters
[01:18:59] <cryptic0> I also need recommendations on email server software.  Postfix vs others.
[01:19:14] <cryptic0> Skywise: yeah no kidding :).
[01:19:51] <Skywise> it depends on your skill, i like sendmail cause i'm comfortable configuring it, it also has wide spread support and addon modules
[01:20:04] <Skywise> but it might be over kill for a single user's email server
[01:20:17] <cryptic0> yeah I am not very skillful.  I would like a minimal and easy to configure server.
[01:20:39] <cryptic0> I remember setting up qmail server 7-8 years ago.  It was a lot of work.  No experience since then.
[01:21:07] Action: TommyC enjoys Postfix.
[01:21:08] <Skywise> i'm sure theres a learning curve anyway you go
[01:21:28] <cryptic0> and that would be okay.  I just dont want something that needs constant tinkering.
[01:21:37] <Nh3xus> I don't have any experience in that either but dealing with MX host name seems a bit hard
[01:22:03] <Skywise> the mx record is dns
[01:22:07] <TommyC> You seem to be describing the entirety of Slackware cryptic0. ^_^
[01:22:20] <Skywise> its how other machines find out where to send email for the domain
[01:22:29] <cryptic0> TommyC: lol I know.
[01:22:48] newt (~newt@123-58-222-209.mycybernet.net) left irc: Quit: WeeChat 0.3.9.1
[01:22:53] <Nh3xus> mx acts the same as DNS does for the web browser ?
[01:23:02] <Skywise> then you assign a priority to each mail host in your system, such as a primary and backup, the lower number has higher priority
[01:23:18] <cryptic0> ah, that brings me to another question.  Do I need to run my own dns server or can I use linode's?
[01:23:22] <Skywise> mx record is a dns record you provide for email
[01:23:44] <Skywise> you need to use whatever dns server is authoratative for your domain
[01:23:48] <Nh3xus> Skywise: You are talking about a redundant setup of server to balance the global load ?
[01:23:59] <Skywise> no, thats how the system is designed
[01:24:12] <cryptic0> Skywise: not sure I understand.  What do you mean by authoritative?
[01:24:59] <Skywise> to have a domain, you have to have a dns server which serves as the authority of the domain
[01:25:01] <Nh3xus> It's looks like authoritative has the same meaning as the one for DHCP server
[01:25:33] <Skywise> so that everyone knows what server to query when wanting information about the ips of the domain and its subdomains
[01:25:38] <TommyC> can slackpkg use curl? O_o
[01:25:48] <cryptic0> Skywise: in that case, I should be fine with using linode's dns servers.
[01:26:15] <Skywise> whoever is hosting your  domain now is who you need to use
[01:26:31] <Nh3xus> At the moment, I just use the free DynDNS redirection for my basic home needs
[01:27:10] <Skywise> either way, adding email support for your domain means creating an mx record for your domain that points to the host for your email
[01:27:39] <Skywise> you can have google host your domain's email, but theres a verification process involved
[01:28:17] <Nh3xus> in order to prevent domain spoofing/squatting right ?
[01:28:41] <Skywise> yeah any kind of fraud
[01:28:52] <Skywise> you have to prove ownership of the domain for them to host it
[01:29:33] <Skywise> then they give you the mx records to use for them hosting your email

[01:30:11] <Skywise> you update your dns and then after it propigates, 24-48hrs for that, then everyone directs email for you to google

[02:00:34] <Skywise> but i'll have to look into it, i get people bothering me about skype all the time
[02:00:57] <Skywise> but i don't see the point of having to look at a picture of someone just sitting there looking at a picture of you while you talk
[02:01:06] <Nh3xus> what do you use along with irc Skywise ?
[02:01:18] <Skywise> who says i use anything but
[02:01:22] <TommyC> Skywise: Skype can do webcam too.
[02:01:51] <Nh3xus> yup too bad they don't provide a 64 bits version of it
[02:02:00] <Skywise> i have my own irc server that i use for friends, and i use teamspeak for gaming
[02:02:13] <Nh3xus> setting up an 64 multib Slack box for that is a bit of an overkill
[02:02:19] <Skywise> but i'm not really into social networking
[02:02:51] <Skywise> i'm just testing a box out now, but 64bit seems more trouble then its worth
[02:03:01] <Nh3xus> Nice to see that you convinced your friends to use such a messaging software !
[02:03:20] <Skywise> thats cause we've been using it since the 90s
[02:03:54] <shonudo> i've been messaging until now

[02:04:44] <Skywise> setting up ssl is easy

[02:06:12] <Skywise> streaming video isn't something i'm in to
[02:06:26] <Nh3xus> I see.
[02:06:27] <Skywise> its not like theres anything happening in the background
[02:06:39] <Nh3xus> File transfert with xdcc right ?
[02:06:40] <Skywise> no crowds or animals
[02:06:52] <Skywise> dcc, but yea
[02:07:30] <Nh3xus> does it use any kind of encryption ?

[03:49:12] <wood_quinn> Yeah, they're dinky.
[03:49:19] <wood_quinn> Is that normal?
[03:49:43] <Skywise> thats between you and your doctor
[03:49:43] <wood_quinn> I've never used a monitor with a resolution higher than 1280x1024.
[03:50:20] <Skywise> you can always increase the size to see how you like it
[03:50:36] <wood_quinn> How?
[03:50:53] <wood_quinn> Each character is about five pixels tall. Looks pretty comical.
[03:51:23] <Skywise> theres prolly a control panel, but you should make sure your desktop is the same dimension as your natural geometery
[03:51:37] <wood_quinn> It's only toolkit stuff.
[03:51:55] <wood_quinn> The contents of Firefox's render area, for example, are fine.
[03:52:12] <Skywise> you can configure that in ff
[03:52:52] <wood_quinn> Well it's across the board, so I'm not going to go through every application and change the font sizes.
[03:53:36] <wood_quinn> Even on a larger resolution, if a button is 32px tall, a 16pt font can't possibly be normally 5px tall.
[03:54:51] Action: wood_quinn shrugs
[03:55:00] <wood_quinn> I guess that's what I get for using Linux.

[04:38:55] <tod_> hi there, i just finished installing slackware and now when my computer boots there's no bios screen or anything... i have windows 8 on /dev/sda1 and /dev/sda2, i installed lilo to /dev/sda3, my root linux partition
[04:39:37] <tod_> i had also unset boot flag on /dev/sda1 and switched it to /dev/sda3
[04:39:52] <tod_> could i please get some advice? :)
[04:40:48] <shonudo> does it boot into any os?
[04:40:56] <tod_> doesn't appear to, just a black screen
[04:41:17] <tod_> i had chosen the save resolution option, not a specific vesa resolution
[04:41:23] <tod_> save=safe
[04:41:23] <shonudo> did you run "lilo" after updating lilo?
[04:41:44] <tod_> no, i just went through the setup gui and rebooted when it told me to
[04:41:46] <shonudo> did you update lilo (come to think of it)?
[04:41:59] <shonudo> grab your install disc and redo lilo

[04:42:52] <tod_> no
[04:43:02] <tod_> i have no screen output whatsoever, it's strange
[04:43:02] <shonudo> f6, f12, or similar
[04:43:11] <shonudo> try the function keys as it reboots
[04:43:14] <tod_> i can try hitting f2 and hope i select the right boot device
[04:43:39] <shonudo> try to get into bios first (first things first)
[04:43:56] <tod_> ok, thanks, one sec
[04:44:00] <shonudo> the bootloader problem is easy enough to fix
[04:45:31] <tod_> if it enters the bios i have no way to tell since the screen remains black
[04:46:38] <shonudo> wonder if you have a hardware problem (dead display)?
[04:47:01] <shonudo> how old is the box/display/laptop or whatever it is?
[04:47:09] <tod_> that is possible i suppose... but right after first reboot seems unlikely
[04:47:21] <shonudo> heh, i gave up on that theory
[04:47:30] <shonudo> i've had drives die just after reformatting
[04:47:42] <shonudo> there are no coincidences, just bad luck
[04:47:57] <tod_> even without a hard drive it should post bios though
[04:48:06] <tod_> i'm not sure how lilo works exactly
[04:48:15] <shonudo> yeah, but you may have a dead display
[04:49:22] <Skywise> you can tell if the screen is dead by shining flash light on to it
[04:49:33] <tod_> the backlight is on
[04:49:42] <shonudo> and asking where it was on the night of the 23rd
[04:49:49] <tod_> ;p
[04:49:56] <Skywise> if you can see shadowy figures then its the backlight
[04:49:59] <shonudo> (if you're going to use a flashlight, you make as well go jack webb on the thing)
[04:50:08] <Skywise> otherwise you might just have a dead lcd panel
[04:50:39] <Skywise> you can get a replacement for less then $200, but you have to make sure its an exact replacement and has the identical connectors
[04:50:53] <shonudo> if you have another display somewhere, swap them out

[10:31:09] <KaMii> so what exactly did he get/win for doing this?
[10:31:21] <branden_> The chance to do it.
[10:31:32] <branden_> Free of charge
[10:31:33] <KaMii> sounds stupid to me
[10:31:42] <branden_> Sounds fun to me
[10:31:50] <branden_> falling at 1000 miles per hour
[10:32:04] <branden_> towards earth and defying nature at the last moment
[10:32:04] <KaMii> yea... i hate flying
[10:32:11] <KaMii> think i will hate falling even more
[10:32:47] <branden_> I would have volunteered, but I was not old enough.
[10:32:51] <KaMii> so, they didnt think to put any stabalizers on him to make sure he would not get into an uncontrolled spin?
[10:33:02] <branden_> Nope
[10:33:09] <KaMii> well, thats just stupid
[10:33:15] <branden_> I wonder about the heat shield though?
[10:33:24] <KaMii> he wasnt traveling fast enough
[10:33:28] <branden_> damn
[10:33:47] <branden_> I thought it would have been needed
[10:33:48] <KaMii> no need for a heat shield, he wasnt orbiting
[10:33:56] <branden_> ah
[10:34:05] <branden_> Still sounds like fun to me.
[10:34:24] <branden_> Just think of the most intense roller coaster ride.
[10:34:31] <branden_> Most likely what it is like
[10:34:32] <KaMii> thats why the space shuttle needs it, its traveling at a very fast speed (i forget how fast) so it can stay in orbit, when it re-enters, all that friction from the speed needs a heat shield
[10:34:51] <KaMii> i doubt jumping feels anything like a roller coaster
[10:34:57] <KaMii> you dont go, up and down
[10:35:09] <KaMii> you just fall
[10:35:09] <branden_> up and down is just perspective
[10:35:28] <branden_> Wait I got an even better one
[10:35:34] <branden_> It is all relative.
[10:35:46] <KaMii> rolller coasters are fun because they exploit gravity, they hit you with a lot of positive and negative g force
[10:36:02] <branden_> You're right
[10:36:02] <KaMii> skydiving, is just falling
[10:36:07] <branden_> This would be way more fun.
[10:36:11] <branden_> Just falling
[10:36:16] <KaMii> i dont see how its anything fun
[10:36:30] <branden_> Just something I want to do one day.
[10:37:07] <branden_> Too bad it would cost me the price of gold in my own weight to get up there.

[18:00:04] <TheM4ch1n3> touch $HOME/.conkyrc
[18:00:22] <FLYSWATER> Wood_quinn, I got my nvidia driver working ;>
[18:00:32] <TheM4ch1n3> there are a couple example config' on there site
[18:00:40] <TheM4ch1n3> *configs
[18:00:56] TommyC (~TommyC@unaffiliated/sepulchralbloom) joined ##slackware.
[18:01:25] <wood_quinn> Also $HOME is pretty useless in bash.
[18:01:37] <wood_quinn> ~/$HOME won't work in particular.
[18:01:41] <TommyC> err, FreeBSD's
[18:01:54] <wood_quinn> You can use ~$USER/ if you feel the need to use a variable.
[18:02:12] <wood_quinn> Or just $HOME
[18:03:29] <FLYSWATER> hm
[18:03:38] <FLYSWATER> so it should be in /root/?
[18:03:52] <wood_quinn> No. It should be in your user's home directory.
[18:04:02] <FLYSWATER> ok
[18:04:06] <FLYSWATER> switching user
[18:04:09] <wood_quinn> It takes two seconds to make a new user, so there's no excuse to wait.
[18:04:26] <FLYSWATER> thank you wood_quinn..

[18:09:39] <wood_quinn> /home/user will be shown as ~/home/user and won't work.
[18:09:49] <wood_quinn> Or /home/user/home/user
[18:10:03] SombreroGuy (~yenikf@44.112.broadband3.iol.cz) left ##slackware.
[18:10:04] <linXea> of course.. but $HOME will not always work

[18:10:19] <FLYSWATER> Ya theres no conky dir in my user home dir
[18:10:28] <FLYSWATER> using showen hidden files...
[18:10:50] <Habitual> so make one.
[18:11:12] <Habitual> or not, it's not 100% necessary.
[18:11:24] kpreston (~kpreston@68.200.91.57) joined ##slackware.
[18:11:26] <linXea> well.. shouldnt be any directory either.. also, just add a conky-config and place it in there.. Call it with $ conky -c /path/to/file..   if you cannot figure out how to rename it to .confkyrc and place it in your home-folder
[18:13:08] <FLYSWATER> ok, Thank you so much and happy new years so all.
[18:14:53] <Habitual> FLYSWATER: http://conky.pitstop.free.fr/wiki/index.php5?title=Main_Page is a pretty good conky reference.
[18:15:17] <wood_quinn> cp /etc/conky/conky.conf ~/.conkyrc

[23:08:04] <wood_quinn> Is LBA used by Linux?
[23:12:31] <Demon_Fox> What does LBA stand for?
[23:12:43] <gnisho> logical block addressing
[23:12:45] <wood_quinn> Logical Block Addressing.
[23:13:19] <Demon_Fox> You mean like the sparse vs flat memory thing.
[23:13:23] <Demon_Fox> ?*
[23:13:28] <gnisho> No.
[23:13:44] <gnisho> LBA gives a logical rather than physical block layout for a harddrive.
[23:13:50] <gnisho> Lets you get around some size limitations.
[23:13:55] <Urchlay> AFAIK, yes, the kernel uses LBA
[23:14:06] <Urchlay> lilo does (it has an option to enable it anyway)
[23:14:09] <Demon_Fox> as in PAE?
[23:14:12] <Urchlay> no
[23:14:26] Nick change: mrtux -> mrtux_
[23:14:38] Nick change: mrtux_ -> mrtux
[23:14:54] <gnisho> Shuffles numbers between sector/track/heads, while total addressable storage remains as close as possible to the physical layout
[23:15:15] <Urchlay> Demon_Fox: it's for hard drives. Instead of referring to a sector by cylinder/head/sector#, you just treat the drive as an array of sectors, and ask for a particular sector, which can be numbered up to what, 2^32?
[23:16:12] <Urchlay> c/h/s is silly anyway, it's probably been 30 years since anyone used a drive dumb enough to have the same number of sectors in every cylinder (which wastes space on the media, since outer cylinders are physically larger)
[23:16:34] <Urchlay> ok, maybe not 30 years, but 20 at least
[23:16:41] <Demon_Fox> I kind of wish they were more to scale
[23:16:44] <Demon_Fox> I mean
[23:16:58] <gnisho> pretty sure a good chunk of drives use spiral formatting these days anyway, which means a 1:1 mapping on CHS doesn't work anymore.
[23:16:59] <Demon_Fox> all spaced out evenly instead of closer at the center
[23:17:52] <Urchlay> gnisho: even without spiral formatting, CHS doesn't really work (because PC BIOSes assume every cylinder has the same # of sectors, which just ain't true)
[23:18:18] <Urchlay> didn't know hard drives actually use spiral, thought that was just for CD/DVD
[23:18:23] <gnisho> Yeah...
[23:18:42] <gnisho> There were some noises about doing it a while back.
[23:19:02] <Demon_Fox> Wait a minute it kind of makes sense
[23:19:07] <Urchlay> wastes even less media than zone sectoring does
[23:19:39] <Demon_Fox> Because then it could spin at any rpm and read the same amount of data from the center and the end
[23:20:00] Nick change: mrtux -> [mrtux]
[23:20:06] <Urchlay> hrr, I dunno about varying the speed in a hard drive
[23:20:10] Nick change: [mrtux] -> mrtux
[23:20:56] <gnisho> last time I looked, you didn't vary spindle speed on drives other than spin up / spin down.
[23:21:25] Nick change: mrtux -> jklsemicolon
[23:21:47] Nick change: jklsemicolon -> mrtux
[23:22:03] <pupit> Hi all, I'm setting up a dhcpd for a hostapd and it tells me to give a wlan0 a "10.254.239.1" IP address. Is that IP address set by some rules or is it just a random address?
[23:23:10] <Urchlay> Demon_Fox: LBA doesn't actually have anything to do with different technologies or data layout inside the drive. All LBA means is that the drive lets you ask for sector #123456 instead of saying "cylinder 100, head 3, sector 18" or whatever
[23:23:31] crack3r (~crack3r@unaffiliated/crack3r) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[23:24:31] <wood_quinn> Also
[23:24:34] <Urchlay> the drive itself maps your logical sector numbers to physical storage (which means the computer doesn't have to know/care about physical disk layout)
[23:24:34] <wood_quinn> XBMC?
[23:24:37] <wood_quinn> Pretty sweet.
[23:24:39] <Demon_Fox> I was not talking about that though
[23:24:54] <Demon_Fox> It sounds more like organization of disk allocation to me.
[23:25:05] <Urchlay> XBMC better or worse than MythTV?
[23:25:16] Nick change: mrtux -> mrtux2
[23:25:23] <wood_quinn> I've never tried MythTV.
[23:25:30] <Demon_Fox> Not a specialized dvr
[23:25:34] <Urchlay> Demon_Fox: well I thought you were asking about LBA... now I dunno what you're talking about :)
[23:25:40] Timslin (~speedy624@unaffiliated/timslin) joined ##slackware.
[23:25:42] <ananke> mythtv and xbmc are targetting two very different things
[23:25:43] <wood_quinn> I figured these things were massive and wouldn't work on my dinky P4. Been surprised so far.
[23:25:47] Nick change: mrtux2 -> mrtux
[23:26:13] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: I've used someone else's mythtv box some, it seems pretty nice.
[23:26:26] <ananke> xbmc first and foremost is a media player. mythtv is a pvr/dvr, with some lousy media playback tacked onto it
[23:26:32] Timslin (~speedy624@unaffiliated/timslin) left ##slackware.
[23:26:58] <thumbs> xbmc is a great player
[23:27:11] <Urchlay> ah. The guy I'm talking about never used the recording feature(s), he just used mythtv to play back stuff he'd downloaded
[23:27:26] <ananke> yep. and it was designed to be one from ground up. it's also one that's used as a base for other media players
[23:27:41] <pupit> I've found on many pages searched by google that "10.254.239.1" is used, but no explanation why...
[23:27:49] <ananke> Urchlay: that's a lousy way to enjoy media.
[23:28:46] <Urchlay> ananke: speaking as someone who just used it, without having to set it up or care about the details, it was OK... not amazing though. I dunno what it'd take in a media player to amaze me :)
[23:29:08] <ananke> Urchlay: try xbmc, plex or boxee.
[23:29:44] <Urchlay> any of those useful on a non-dedicated system? (like, plain slackware box running windowmaker)
[23:29:49] <ananke> ability to automatically fetch appropriate metadata for your movies/tv shows, and present it in an elegant manner, is a key. not to mention, keeping track of it, what you've watched, etc
[23:29:56] <wood_quinn> To amaze me, it'd have to be able to get decent quality TV, movies, and (important stipulation) fansubs.
[23:29:58] <ananke> Urchlay: all of them
[23:30:17] <wood_quinn> ananke: Yeah and that.
[23:30:26] <ananke> wood_quinn: _to get_? that's not media player's job
[23:30:48] <wood_quinn> Why not? Every commercial media player is also a library manager.
[23:31:00] <ananke> wood_quinn: library manager doesn't _get_ content
[23:31:09] <wood_quinn> Every commercial one does.
[23:31:28] ryerke (~bert-mage@ma30536d0.tmodns.net) left irc: Quit: leaving
[23:31:35] <wood_quinn> It makes zero sense to manage download queues, libraries, and playlists in three different applications and interface styles.
[23:31:36] <Urchlay> hr. I tend to just say "mplayer blah.avi" and not care about metadata
[23:31:40] <ananke> perhaps we should define what you mean by 'get'. sounds like you're talking about streaming content, not 'downloading and storing it'
[23:31:51] <wood_quinn> I don't need it stored, nah.
[23:31:57] <wood_quinn> I'll likely only watch it once.
[23:32:00] <ananke> wood_quinn: then what content are you talking about?
[23:32:23] <wood_quinn> Still, if I have shitty internet, it'd be nice to store it, and I happen to because my internet is indeed shitty.
[23:32:50] <Urchlay> the metadata I guess is in the path to the file and the filename itself... tvshows/doctor_who/season21/134-resurrection_of_the_daleks-1_of_4.avi
[23:33:43] <ananke> Urchlay: and the players i've listed support automatically downloading associated metadata from the internet: tv show art, description of the episode, etc
[23:34:03] <Urchlay> yeah. Not really something I care about, but I can see how someone would
[23:34:16] <ananke> wood_quinn: i'm still wondering what 'commercial players' you're talking about, and what exact content
[23:35:09] <ananke> Urchlay: it makes some things easier, such as keeping track of what show you've watched and which episodes, what actors appear in which episodes, etc
[23:35:22] <Urchlay> although I wouldn't mind having some sort of musicbrainz type thing, that can identify unknown audio files
[23:35:36] <Urchlay> (don't need it built into the player though)
[23:35:40] <wood_quinn> ananke: I'm not remotely interested in arguing with you about the defintion of a word as ambiguous as "content."
[23:36:01] <ananke> wood_quinn: you don't have to. just list some of those commercial players
[23:36:14] <ananke> unless, of course, it was all just made up
[23:36:21] <Urchlay> "content" is almost as vague as "synergy" or "leverage"
[23:36:24] <wood_quinn> Name a commercial player that doesn't?
[23:36:36] <wood_quinn> I'm not really obliged to defend myself.
[23:36:37] <ananke> wood_quinn: i see. so you can't provide evidence to your own argument
[23:37:23] <Urchlay> well, I have no idea what commercial players people use... itunes? windows media player? netflix (is that a player or just a delivery system?)
[23:37:25] <wood_quinn> As you may have noticed, I also can't provide a fuck about your opinion.
[23:37:37] <wood_quinn> I'm too busy playing with XBMC.
[23:38:00] <ananke> Urchlay: netflix is a service, which happens to have its own web-based player. as a service, it's also accessible by a ton of media players and their plugions
[23:38:14] <Urchlay> I've been off in free software / open source land for so long that I haven't kept track. What's commercial and not crappy/evil?
[23:38:16] <ananke> wood_quinn: figures. pure bullshit, no substance
[23:38:39] <ananke> Urchlay: depends. are you talking hardware or software player?
[23:38:42] <wood_quinn> I tell you, I've never missed lack of metadata and all the plot summaries and thumbnails that come with it.
[23:38:47] <Urchlay> I guess software
[23:38:56] <wood_quinn> But it kind of brightens up your library.
[23:39:00] <wood_quinn> At least mine.
[23:39:07] <wood_quinn> Which is just a text file :)
[23:39:07] <Urchlay> not really interested in hardware players, you can't build those from source for free :)
[23:39:19] <ananke> Urchlay: the three i've listed: xbmc, plex and boxee are probably three of the biggest ones
[23:40:07] <ananke> Urchlay: hardware players have the nice factor of being small, low power, include all the necessary connectivity [hdmi, etc] and have remotes. on top of a lot of them you can run xbmc, plex, etc
[23:41:06] <Urchlay> yeah. If I owned a TV set I might want a set-top box... though when I had one, it was a desktop PC running slackware + my own mplayer/mame/etc frontend
[23:41:27] <ananke> and if you factor in power consumption, something that draws 10W of power is going to pay for itself in a year, comparing it to 100-150W of a modest desktop
[23:41:32] <Urchlay> this was either before stuff like mythtv/xmbc, or maybe just before I knew about it (2003 maybe)
[23:41:39] <ananke> ahh, then yeah, if you don't have a tv, then it makes little sense

[23:42:11] <ananke> Urchlay: do you have any other devices which you'll want to use for viewing content, or just that one desktop?
[23:42:38] <Urchlay> unless maybe I wanted to have a portable movie-watching device... for long car trips or such
[23:43:03] <Urchlay> well, "that one desktop" has been parted out now, bits of it are in a couple different machines, the rest is gathering dust...
[23:43:32] yht (~yht@110.138.46.22) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[23:43:40] <Urchlay> right now, I keep one box running, with one monitor, and anything I watch is on that (using mplayer from the command line, generally)
[23:43:46] <ananke> biggest difference between plex and xbmc/boxee/most players is that plex is a server/client system [you can run both on the same box of course]. that gives you ability to stream content to whatever device you have
[23:44:11] <ananke> again, useful for people with more than one device/tv/etc
[23:46:04] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Do you use any kind of frontend (GMPlayer or otherwise) with MPlayer?
