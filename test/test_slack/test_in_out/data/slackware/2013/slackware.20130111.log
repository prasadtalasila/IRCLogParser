[00:06:19] <bedtime> i'm reading the slackbook and it doesnt mention setting up mkinitrd whilst doing the initial install. is this automatically preformed?
[00:06:32] <TommyC> No.
[00:06:52] <TommyC> the slackbook was written quite some time ago by the old Slackware team. mkinitrd was introduced with the new Slackware team.
[00:07:00] <bedtime> the booke says to reboot though
[00:07:17] <bedtime> ok
[00:07:41] TheM4ch1n3 (~shaun@41.50.16.55) left irc: Ping timeout: 246 seconds
[00:09:20] <bedtime> thats gonna be tuff to setup then. it'll involve chrooting into the slack installation and running mkinitrd, would it not?

[00:10:31] <TommyC> If you already ran through setup, chrooting just requires running "chroot /mnt" since the installer sets up everything.
[00:10:43] <andarius> You can set it to boot using the huge kernel to get things moving. Then build an initrd later and move to a generic kernel
[00:10:54] <bedtime> okay
[00:11:19] <bedtime> i might tpdo the huge kernel then first
[00:11:55] <KaMii> why not just build your intird after the installer before you reboot?
[00:12:24] <bedtime> i hope i can do that kamii
[00:12:28] <KaMii> i thought i did that on my lvm-luks systems, but i forget maybe i did have to chroot int
[00:12:44] <andarius> It is usefull to start with the huge kernel if you are unsure. It also helps to have it in place and bootalbe as a recovery mens in case of something tanking
[00:13:00] <andarius> s/mens/means/
[00:14:00] <pink_mist> "mens" has a very different meaning in swedish :X

[02:10:41] <Jdogzz> You're a KDE or a XFCE person?
[02:11:07] <shonudo> are you an oak man?
[02:11:17] <bedtime> i like enlightenment actually. next would be kde
[02:11:29] <bedtime> yep shonudo :)
[02:11:58] <bedtime> lol, i thought you said are you okay man
[02:12:13] <shonudo> no, "are you an oak man?".... pulp fiction
[02:12:17] <shonudo> i was going to go on
[02:12:20] <shonudo> but not need
[02:12:24] <shonudo> you're okay, btw
[02:12:25] <shonudo> :P
[02:12:31] <bedtime> lol :b
[02:12:43] <Jdogzz> Enlightenment is getting a lot of attention these days, a little too glossy for my taste though.
[02:13:06] <Jdogzz> As is KDE. I love Fluxbox myself:)
[02:13:23] <shonudo> love both, myself
[02:13:25] <bedtime> jdogzz, just choose a different theme. e17 almost rivals kde with its configurability
[02:13:57] <Jdogzz> Just enough in Fluxbox to make it easier than FVWM and just enough less than KDE to prevent high resource usage.
[02:14:30] <bedtime> i'm not really into fluxbox
[02:14:40] <Jdogzz> That was another problem I had with Enlightenment, I'm not that superficial:) Both it and KDE started to make my fan run harder than normal.
[02:14:42] <shonudo> i tend to use flux on anything that can't use kde
[02:14:50] <shonudo> and i do love flux
[02:15:08] <bedtime> e17 seems to do everthing i want and is cpu/ram efficient

[03:16:29] <TommyC> server or personal?
[03:16:35] <TommyC> On servers I use vi (not vim).
[03:16:38] <TommyC> vim is like...20x bigger.
[03:16:47] <Urchlay> you mean elvis, if they're slackware servers
[03:17:05] <Urchlay> (slackware's vi is elvis, unless you change the /usr/bin/vi symlink to point to vim after install)
[03:17:16] <wood_quinn> Which is an improved vi. Just not VI iMproved
[03:17:17] BrokenCog (~BrokenCog@pdpc/supporter/active/brokencog) joined ##slackware.
[03:18:06] <Urchlay> elvis does exactly one thing I like better than vim: it has a hex-editing mode. With vim, you're expected to use xxd to make a hexdump, edit that, then xxd -r to turn it back into a binary
[03:18:57] <TommyC> mhmm, elvis is what I'm talking about.

[03:22:42] <wood_quinn> Personally, if I'm going to write code I want to be able to use my mouse.
[03:22:53] <wood_quinn> So neither editor is really worth my time.
[03:23:27] <Myk267> what's wrong with your mouse?
[03:23:36] <Urchlay> all I want a mouse for when coding, is copy/pasting. Which works fine in either vim or emacs
[03:23:55] <wood_quinn> I could never get pasting working in vim.

[03:24:12] <wood_quinn> Didn't try it.
[03:24:15] <Urchlay> vim in a terminal, or gvim?
[03:24:19] <wood_quinn> In a terminal
[03:24:34] <wood_quinn> I indent code, and vim screws it up when copying.
[03:24:56] <wood_quinn> So I just ragequit and opened nano the last time I gave vim a serious weeklong shot.
[03:25:05] tpollard (~tpollard@59.167.220.45) joined ##slackware.
[03:25:18] <Urchlay> ah, for that, you want ":set nocindent" (before pasting) and ":set cindent" after pasting. Of course you can define macros for those...
[03:26:25] <alisonken1home> TommyC: hmm - at least on slack vi is symlinked to elvis
[03:26:36] <Urchlay> the trouble is, vim doesn't know you're pasting already-indented code (since terminal apps can't tell the difference between types and mouse-pasted input), so it tries to indent it again
[03:27:08] hamitron (~hamitron@gate.bizy.co.uk) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[03:27:28] <BrokenCog> and in Emacs that would be fixed by, highlight tab done.
[03:27:52] <wood_quinn> In nano it's fixed by "Oh you pasted? Ok. I'll put what you pasted there."
[03:28:07] <Urchlay> vim has a similar thing. Highlight (with shift-V), then hit =

[04:16:20] <BrokenCo1> I just bought it a couple months ago to replace the previous one which wouldn't power machines if AC was lost.
[04:17:02] <Urchlay> should maybe have just replaced the batteries in the old one
[04:17:20] <BrokenCo1> did that three months ago.
[04:17:22] <Urchlay> cheaper, plus if you'd been using it a while, you know it otherwise works
[04:17:33] <Urchlay> the replacements only lasted *3 months*?
[04:17:43] <BrokenCo1> no.  replacement didn't change behaviour.
[04:17:46] <Urchlay> ah
[04:17:53] <BrokenCo1> so I use it to power robots.
[04:18:01] <BrokenCo1> the new battery I mean.
[04:18:16] <Urchlay> that blows. 99% of bad UPSes just have dead batteries...
[04:18:29] <Urchlay> (and 87% of statistics are made up on the spot!)
[04:18:53] <BrokenCo1> I was realyl surpised that wasn't the battery.

[04:20:04] <BrokenCog> guess that's _another_ thing to keep track of :).
[04:20:18] <Urchlay> well... dying battery could cause it. Most UPSes self-test every so often (just switch over to battery power briefly). If the battery won't hold a charge, the self-test cycle causes it to power cycle...
[04:20:33] Action: BrokenCog is waiting for a computer to make his life less complicated ... in the mean time is going to bed.
[04:20:38] <Urchlay> now that it's running, try pulling the AC power, see if it runs on battery at all
[04:20:48] <Urchlay> (just because it's new doesn't mean its batteries aren't crap)
[04:20:58] <BrokenCog> true.  but this is a new UPS, don't know ... right.

[04:21:24] <BrokenCog> ... warranty probably expried yesterday.
[04:21:28] <Urchlay> consumer-grade UPSes are almost as bad as not having a UPS, in my (somewhat limited) experience

[04:22:32] <BrokenCog> I never really had one before, but now I have this fancy CPU and GPU, and don't like the idea of them being power cycled several times a day becasue the utility here sucks.

[05:48:48] <Urchlay> pi31415: I rarely run into this kind of error. This is a 64-bit app failing to run.
[05:49:11] <Urchlay> usually if anything fails, it's either at compile time, or else it's a 32-bit app failing to run...
[05:49:27] <pi31415> I never run into a 64-bit app failing to run
[05:49:39] <Urchlay> have you got multilib slack64 and some time to kill?
[05:49:46] <pink_mist> have you checked with 'file' if it actually *is* a 64bit app? :P
[05:49:48] <pi31415> I have run into multilib installs where the 32-bit library conflicts with the 64-bit library
[05:50:04] <pink_mist> and checked with ldd that it's not linked with any 32bit libraries (if that's possible)
[05:50:29] <pi31415> it has been too long since I stopped using multilib to remember the details
[05:51:08] <Urchlay> pink_mist: yes, it's a 64-bit binary. Its problem is that its libraries are installed in /usr/lib64/ardour2/ rather than just plain /usr/lib64. The app is launched by a script that basically does: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/ardour2/ ; exec /usr/lib64/ardour2/ardour2-2.8.14
[05:51:46] <nawcom> the only time ive ever needs to run 32 bit apps is when the software is proprietary, like skype. and to take care of that without having to do multilib, a few people have made pkgs for running it on 64 bit with its min required 32 bit libs bundled in its own folder and linked up. its pretty nice.
[05:52:07] <nawcom> found that on linuxquestions slackware section on some skype thread
[05:52:08] <pi31415> nawcom, free software is often hard-coded for 32-bit
[05:52:22] <Urchlay> if I symlink all the libs to /usr/lib64, it'll run fine. But this used to work, on slackware64 13.37 + multilib. Not sure what's changed (ardour's a newer version too, not sure whether it's the new ardour or new slackware that's causing this)
[05:52:43] <pi31415> nawcom, this is true for the majority of sega genesis emulators
[05:54:06] <nawcom> pi31415, if they were lazy enough to not write it to have decent support in handling other common archs then they did a lazy job. and i haven't run into that issue that often at all during compile time. but i know what you're referring to.
[05:54:12] <Urchlay> ..adding /usr/lib64/ardour2 to ld.so.conf (then running ldconfig) works. But it shouldn't be needed.
[05:55:03] <pi31415> nawcom, far from being lazy, they hand tailored assembly code to make the best use of older processors
[05:55:33] <Urchlay> plenty of reasons for free software to be 32-bit-only. Sometimes it's partly written in x86 assembler (emulators and games do this a lot), sometimes the code depends implicitly on things like sizeof(int) being 4 always (which it is on x86 but not x86_64)
[05:55:43] <nawcom> also if by free you meant free closed source tehn my bad. as im a little drunk atm. heh.
[05:55:50] <pi31415> loads of free software will not compile on 16-bit systems
[05:56:07] <pi31415> lua requires 32-bit or better
[05:56:20] <Urchlay> yeah, but most of that stuff was developed on 32-bit to begin with, nobody expected it to compile/run on 16-bit
[05:56:38] <nawcom> well anyways that big paragraph i just typed is me essentially saying there's a harder yet more comfortable solution to multilib imo

[05:59:59] <Urchlay> ...except the censorship episode, where mr. garrison could say "fag" because he is one, and everyone else got bleeped when they said it... except Jimbo
[06:00:06] <KaMii> word definitions evolve
[06:00:12] <KaMii> deal with it, dont censor
[06:00:19] <KaMii> Urchlay: lol that was funny
[06:00:36] <KaMii> hey there, shitty shitty fag fag shitty shitty fag fag how do you do...
[06:01:43] <Urchlay> to put it in perspective: who here would be annoyed by this sentence?  "Slackware ships with OSS emulation enabled, that's lame!"
[06:01:45] <pi31415> nawcom, on that topic, what do you think about removing the N word from Huckleberry Finn?
[06:02:01] <nawcom> you also prob find it annoying that little people don't like being called midgets, eh? no one is stopping you from calling things gay, in the US. dunno what you saw.
[06:02:01] <Urchlay> now this sentence: "Slackware ships with OSS emulation enabled, that's gay!"
[06:02:11] <Urchlay> ...is one really more evil than the other somehow?
[06:02:26] <pi31415> Urchlay: "Slackware ships with MP3 encoders included, that's lame!"

[06:03:02] Nick change: goj_killedByISP -> goj
[06:04:25] <Urchlay> my point is... most people who would reject "gay" as being offensive, would be OK with "lame". Even though it'd be just as offensive (to people in wheelchairs)
[06:05:05] <FrankD> i wish i could find my kill-a-watt
[06:05:09] <nawcom> when there is a word that originates as meaning happy and being positive to referring to homosexuality in negative context to being used as a general term used in negative context, i can see how the gay community can feel disrespected. i dunno man. i give a shit about language and how it affects people. so it's not worth my time to call things "gay" when there are more intelligent words to use, as wel
[06:05:09] <nawcom> l as the fact that there's history behind the word.
[06:05:42] <nawcom> that's my opinion on the matter

[06:15:20] <d4wnr4z0r> what's the issue, Urchlay?
[06:15:43] <Urchlay> ah! I turned on the filesystem capability bits for realtime priority (and forgot I did it). The dynamic linker's ignoring the LD_LIBRARY_PATH (same thing it would do for a suid binary)
[06:15:56] <Urchlay> that's annoying, slack 13.37 didn't do that.
[06:16:34] <d4wnr4z0r> that's less than useful.
[06:16:37] <Urchlay> d4wnr4z0r: ardour couldn't find its shared libs. Apparently it's because of a change in how the glibc dyn linker works in 14.0...

[06:16:58] <FrankD> anyone want to donate a couple opteron 4386s to me?
[06:17:14] <FrankD> ill love you forever.
[06:17:15] <Urchlay> well, for setuid binaries, you definitely don't want users replacing e.g. printf() with their own implementation (that does whatever they want, as root)
[06:18:13] <d4wnr4z0r> right right
[06:18:39] <Urchlay> it's less clear-cut for bins with a couple of capability bits set (unlimited memory use and realtime scheduling). That'd be a DoS, but the linker ought to provide a config file or such, somewhere, so the admin can make that decision
[06:18:46] <d4wnr4z0r> but you *do* want a user to be able to set library paths and utilize realtime priority while doing so. even though that is also something of a risk.
[06:19:12] <Urchlay> yeah. The binary itself is only executable by the audio group (which contains only me, so I trust it implicitly)
[06:19:24] <d4wnr4z0r> GNU utilities are such ridiculously moving targets :(
[06:20:02] <Urchlay> the man page for ld.so mentions the setuid behavior... wonder if the caps stuff is mentioned in the info page (which I didn't read yet)
[06:20:15] <d4wnr4z0r> don't even get me started on info.
[06:20:43] <Urchlay> there doesn't seem to be an info page for ld.so anyway
[06:21:00] <Urchlay> info just shows the man page (which I didn't even know it could do)
[06:21:06] <d4wnr4z0r> wild.
[06:21:19] <Urchlay> if only man could show info pages...
[06:21:37] <Urchlay> I might read them more often if the viewer didn't suck rocks through a flexy straw
[06:22:04] <d4wnr4z0r> I used to have a basic ability to navigate them
[06:22:13] <d4wnr4z0r> now I have less
[06:22:36] <Urchlay> I tend to do something like... cd /usr/info ; zgrep "whatever" *
[06:22:42] <d4wnr4z0r> so I end up hitting "q" a lot and starting over
[06:22:46] <Urchlay> then vim on the results of the grep
[06:23:06] <Urchlay> (info files are pretty readable in a text editor, that much is nicer than man's troff mess)
[06:24:02] <d4wnr4z0r> the sbotools man pages are pretty readable in an editor
[06:24:21] <d4wnr4z0r> I didn't use any macro languages to create them, though
[06:24:45] <Urchlay> for stuff like that, I'd tend to write the docs using perl's pod, and pod2man to create the man page
[06:24:57] <Urchlay> (your stuff's in perl anyway, isn't it?)
[06:25:20] <d4wnr4z0r> yeah
[06:25:29] <d4wnr4z0r> but for some reason I didn't think of that
[06:26:02] <Urchlay> and pod2html for your web site
[06:26:44] <d4wnr4z0r> oh well
[06:27:18] <Urchlay> for slackbuilds where I include a man page (because upstream doesn't), I'll generate it with help2man, then edit it so it actually makes sense
[06:27:44] <Urchlay> probly ought to write myself a help2pod script
[06:27:53] <d4wnr4z0r> oh, that's neat
[06:27:58] <d4wnr4z0r> wasn't aware of that
[06:28:16] <Urchlay> help2man's actually a perl script already, would be easy to mutate it into a pod generator instead

[08:18:27] <ventYl> equipment has to be designed to deal with 240V to be cheap and suitable for european market
[08:18:38] <ventYl> i heard that in some zones 170V is standard
[08:19:07] <Urchlay> most stuff, that just means stick a different wall-wart on it. Or use the other contact on the power transformer, for stuff with its own xformer
[08:19:24] <Urchlay> I never heard of 170V in the US. Some other country, maybe in South America?
[08:19:40] <FrankD> thatd be weird imo
[08:19:57] <Urchlay> there's 240V for stuff like refrigerators and dryers (and mondo-sized UPSes)

[08:20:31] <FrankD> http://i.imgur.com/S8BvI.jpg
[08:21:04] <ventYl> lower voltage only means denser pulses
[08:21:24] <Urchlay> ventYl: what kind of stuff you talking about? (as I understand it, the 120V/240V switch on the back of a PC power supply controls whether the transformer is center-tapped or uses the whole thing)
[08:21:28] <FrankD> buying another GTX 660 in the beginning of Feb, have $50 off at EVGA
[08:21:36] <FrankD> Urch: pssh PSUs dont even have that anymore
[08:21:51] <Urchlay> really?
[08:21:57] <FrankD> yeah
[08:21:58] <FrankD> most of them
[08:21:58] <Urchlay> mine's only a couple years old, and has it
[08:22:00] <ruskie> they generally auto adapt
[08:22:05] <ventYl> Urchlay: for example most of AC adapters for laptops. they can work from 110 to 240V
[08:22:29] <Urchlay> ventYl: ah, didn't know that
[08:22:49] <ventYl> you only need adapter cord for different plug
[08:22:54] <Urchlay> I wouldn't want to try it with the adaptor for my 22" LCD though
[08:23:13] <FrankD> im going to have to run a 220 line for my computers when i get a house..
[08:23:27] <ventYl> depends on what's written on it but probably it will survive
[08:23:32] <Urchlay> if I could actually afford to travel to different countries, I might already know this stuff :)
[08:23:38] <FrankD> this thing will use around 8A, my FX-8120 will use a good 4-5A, and my 820 system will use 3-4A
[08:23:41] <ventYl> because whole europe uses 230V lines everywhere
[08:23:52] <FrankD> add a couple amps for 10 monitors
[08:24:02] <FrankD> and i cant run my shit on one 15 amp circuit. :P
[08:24:13] <ruskie> heh
[08:24:20] <Urchlay> I can take a 120V jolt, it barely bothers me, 230V might hurt a bit more
[08:24:29] <FrankD> i got shocked today on someones shitty soldering iron
[08:24:34] <Urchlay> ugh
[08:24:37] <FrankD> grabbed the cord.. and yep, they burned through it right there
[08:24:46] <FrankD> not bad, but surprising/annoying
[08:24:46] <ruskie> fun
[08:25:02] <Urchlay> watched a guy use a circular saw to saw through its own power cord once
[08:25:07] <ventYl> everything above 50V is considered as unsafe when talking about AC
[08:25:11] <Urchlay> shower of sparks, then nothing
[08:25:14] <FrankD> Urhclay: lol
[08:25:19] <FrankD> thats awesome
[08:25:51] <Urchlay> ventYl: US landline phones used to use 48VAC for the ring signal, if you happened to be touching the wrong bit when the phone rang, you'd damn well know it

[08:26:43] <Urchlay> there's a story about a phone tech trying to fix a trouble where the phone wouldn't ring at this residence... but the people always knew when someone was calling them, because the dog would bark
[08:26:49] <pink_mist> 230V jolt is not fun :X has gotten that a few times when doing stuff with electricity here :X
[08:27:27] <Urchlay> dog barks because they'd tied his leash to the phone wire, it rubbed through part of the insulation, so he was catching 48VAC whenever the phone rang.
[08:27:55] <Urchlay> (those people must have been too dumb to own either a phone *or* a dog)
[08:28:51] <KaMii> isnt that animal cruelty
[08:28:57] <KaMii> thats illegal in sweden
[08:29:12] <ventYl> my coleague who did some electrical jobs in US (dunno which state) told me that there's areas with 170VAC lines (considered as commercial zones)
[08:29:17] <FrankD> nobody likes my desktop? :P
[08:29:27] <FrankD> never heard of 170V lines in the US..
[08:29:54] <pink_mist> maybe there was a smudge on the second 1 in 110, which made it look like 170
[08:29:56] <ventYl> maybe industrial?

[08:33:19] <Urchlay> come to think of it, I feel the same way about human kids, too
[08:34:05] <FrankD> hmm we had 3 phase, 480v.. i thought we had something in the 300s for voltage too *shrug*
[08:34:10] <LinuxFireLappi> Its actually 90VAC when ringing and 48VAC off hook

[08:35:48] <Urchlay> you could forward your calls to the one for payphones that said "The call you have made requires a 25 cent deposit"

[08:37:59] <Urchlay> there was also a "silent termination" number (just connected you to a dead line, you heard nothing but the phone stayed off hook). Was useful when I was a kid, not supposed to get calls after 10PM, but that number + call waiting = parents didn't hear the phone ringing

[08:39:42] <FrankD> thats nice
[08:39:51] <FrankD> better.. than.. star trek??
[08:39:57] <FrankD> scuse me?
[08:40:02] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea i agree, but if I can make it so the pipe organ is not trashed... then I would use kde just so i would get pipe organ music on startup and shutdown
[08:40:54] <Urchlay> FrankD: well, to me anyway, it's better than all of star trek except maybe the original series with kirk & spock
[08:40:54] <FrankD> look at all that copper

[08:47:25] <FrankD> ahh

[08:48:31] <Urchlay> saw one of those that actually worked not long ago
[08:48:39] <Urchlay> forgot how hard they are to use
[08:48:55] <KaMii> they took a royal typewriter and did som modifications to put in the escape key and other special keys
[08:49:13] <Urchlay> so when he presses a key, it's got an inch or more of travel?
[08:49:31] <KaMii> i bet he was one of the bank owners that needed a bail out

[08:50:07] <KaMii> that would suck to type on
[08:50:29] <Urchlay> and you can't press a 2nd key until the first one is at least part of the way back up (or else the arms will hit each other & stick together)
[08:50:36] <FrankD> haha
[08:50:36] <FrankD> yeah
[08:50:50] <Urchlay> I first learned to type on one of those. As bad as it sucked, it was still better than handwriting
[08:50:56] <KaMii> so how does he do a three finger salute?

[09:05:54] <KaMii> you mean meth heads?
[09:05:55] <Urchlay> go read "the electric kool-aid acid test"
[09:05:59] <Urchlay> no, meth wasn't invented
[09:06:00] <KaMii> yea, we got them too
[09:06:40] <Urchlay> (can you really make "organic milk" out of hemp?!)
[09:06:46] <FrankD> haha

[09:07:03] <KaMii> organic hemp milk
[09:07:04] <ventYl> KaMii: carrying macs and wearing beards and/or arafat scard?
[09:07:07] <KaMii> it actually tastes good....
[09:07:08] <ventYl> *scarf?
[09:07:08] <Urchlay> KaMii: the hippie answer to that is "there's such a thing as a library, you know"
[09:07:19] <KaMii> arafat scarf, lmfao
[09:07:22] <Urchlay> or else "screw The Man, just rip the book off if you want it!"
[09:07:38] <FrankD> argh i need to make my desk
[09:07:41] <KaMii> Urchlay: well its probably always checked out in the library
[09:07:46] <FrankD> i got all the aluminum in
[09:07:50] <KaMii> hippie literature is always on reserve
[09:07:52] <Urchlay> wtf, what part of a pot plant do they get milk from?
[09:08:05] <KaMii> Urchlay: im not sure where they extract it from
[09:08:18] <KaMii> oh, the hemp seed
[09:08:23] <KaMii> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemp_milk
[09:08:26] <Urchlay> oh, like soy "milk"
[09:08:41] <Urchlay> soy milk never tastes right to me (it's ok for putting in coffee but that's about all)
[09:09:35] <KaMii> i tried some hemp milk at this hippie coffee shop, the girl was like going off about hemp and was like, 'here dude, man, like you gotta try this, its like totally awesome and good for you because it doesnt rape cows'
[09:09:50] <Urchlay> ugh
[09:09:55] <KaMii> and i was like... im a girl, its very obvious im a girl.... dont call me dude
[09:10:08] <KaMii> she had armpit hair
[09:10:16] <Urchlay> she probably thought you were hot

[09:10:36] <KaMii> i think she was too out of her mind to know that I was even there
[09:10:50] <KaMii> but i tried it and it was actually good
[09:10:55] <KaMii> i didnt tell her though
[09:11:03] <Urchlay> we have people like that here, but I can't be bothered to talk to 'em for long, or spend much time at the places where they congregate (or "graze" as I think of it)
[09:11:22] <KaMii> yea, she said milking cows was rape
[09:11:42] <KaMii> i had to leave before I got into a war with a 'pacifist hippie'
[09:11:49] <Urchlay> although if I had to choose between a bunch of stoned neo-hippies who think milk is rape, and a bunch of white-collar Republican office management types, I'd probably prefer the hippies
[09:12:03] <Crosma> Well, they do force-milk the cows. But we force-kill them too.
[09:12:06] <Crosma> Is that also rape?
[09:12:11] <Crosma> Is killing a form of rape?
[09:12:13] <Urchlay> (they probably have better taste in music, and less likely to steal all my money)
[09:12:17] <KaMii> Urchlay: i would choose option three, a bunch of cats
[09:12:18] <Urchlay> no, killing is killing

[09:13:51] <Urchlay> life's too short to eat fake bacon
[09:13:58] <Crosma> Plants are creatures too, really. They're just not as human-like.
[09:14:11] <Crosma> Surely eating a carrot is just as bad.
[09:14:17] <KaMii> Urchlay: my grandma had some so i tried it
[09:14:21] <Urchlay> right, I was thinking of what plants eat (sunlight and whatever nutrients are in the soil)

[09:14:24] <KaMii> i dont shy from trying new food

[09:16:00] <KaMii> which is sooo glad i live in oregon

[09:17:58] <KaMii> sometimes they get it fresh at the seafood market here
[09:18:15] <Urchlay> "According to a Japanese study, a newly opened can of surstrmming has one of the most putrid food smells in the world"... Wonder if it's worse than opening a can of dog food
[09:18:27] <Crosma> Dog food smells kinda nice to me.
[09:18:29] <Urchlay> (the cheap dog food, for people too poor to feed a dog properly)
[09:18:31] <MLanden> KaMii: awesome...\o/
[09:18:37] <macavity> the smell of surstrmming alone should detere anyone from attempting to taste it
[09:18:57] <ventYl> :)))
[09:19:07] <KaMii> MLanden: sounds like that islandic shark is about as bad as surstrmming
[09:19:10] <ventYl> what can smell worse than dead fish?
[09:19:15] <ventYl> rotten dead fish!
[09:19:15] <Urchlay> the dog food that used to be 10 cents a can in the 80s, did *not* smell good. Not even to a dog with a cold.
[09:19:24] <KaMii> after i had surstrmming i brushed my fish, then threw away the toothbrush
[09:19:31] <KaMii> fish... lol teeth
[09:19:34] <ventYl> :D
[09:19:36] <Urchlay> freud was right :)

[09:23:16] <MLanden> Urchlay: ewwww....sounds like something from a punk rock photo session
[09:23:21] <macavity> Crosma: dont forget to open the can out doors.. it tends to be somewhat preassurised

[09:23:55] <Crosma> I'm not sure how I'd get it in Australia anyway. Might be easier to get some in the UK when I go back.
[09:24:13] <Urchlay> ...where "protein" is code for "maggots" of course
[09:24:32] <KaMii> they forgot to mention in the wikipedia article that you open the can of surstrmming in a bucket under water
[09:24:41] <KaMii> and always outside
[09:25:10] <KaMii> its so when the can depressurizes the spray of the brine doesnt get on you or the clothes

[09:26:00] <Urchlay> think what it does to the inside of your stomach
[09:26:43] <KaMii> gets digested

[09:37:26] <Crosma> British people just get drunk and trash everything wherever they are.
[09:37:47] <KaMii> no its because alcohol is sooooooo fucking expensive in sweden, and its government owned, you can only buy it at a government owned store, but in prague its cheaper than water, so swedes go there just to get drunk

[09:39:58] <KaMii> like, in sweden we have whats called 'pants legal'
[09:40:21] <KaMii> when you are 15 you are 'pants legal' meaning, your sex life is your business
[09:40:29] <KaMii> its illegal for your parents to say you cannot have sex
[09:40:47] <KaMii> and at 15 you can have sex with anyone of any age older than you
[09:41:23] <KaMii> but idk, i dont think sweden really cares about sex, not like in the usa where they try to tell you its wrong, dont do it, abstinence, and that shit
[09:41:29] <KaMii> they dont say that in sweden
[09:41:38] <Crosma> Yeah. It's stupid, because they all screw anyway.

[09:45:40] <Cultist> they all influence each other

[09:46:37] <Crosma> You can't show genitals in Japan.
[09:46:42] <Crosma> Tits aren't genitals.
[09:46:46] <KaMii> yea, just the top
[09:46:52] <KaMii> everything else is sensored
[09:46:59] <KaMii> its really confusing to me
[09:47:15] <Adnauseam> the same applies to germans
[09:47:15] <Crosma> They make up for the lack of genitals with tentacles.
[09:47:28] <KaMii> they do that manga stuff
[09:47:43] <Adnauseam> the hot and slutty part but mainly because it's because sex isn;'t viewed as a bad thing here.
[09:48:18] <Adnauseam> kind of sorry for people who view sex as bad :| causes quiet a few neurotic disorders
[09:48:22] <KaMii> i remember i think i was like 8 years old, i was in some bookstore and this japanes business man was masturbating in the store looking at manga, he saw me, freak out, looked like he was about to die, then ran off
[09:48:24] <Crosma> Well, speaking as a Briton. I think British people are incredibly slutty, and not so great looking usually.
[09:48:28] <KaMii> i was like, whats his problem?

[09:51:09] <Adnauseam> oh legalities don;'t have to be enforced by the state
[09:51:21] <Adnauseam> "legal" things are just formalities for social norms
[09:51:32] <Adnauseam> and if your social norm demands it, it's poretty much a "legal" issue
[09:51:45] <Cultist> still, not all women do wear it
[09:51:47] <Adnauseam> unless you want to be excommunicated and rejected by your social clique
[09:51:54] <Adnauseam> my mother doesn;'t, my aunts do
[09:51:57] <Adnauseam> depends on your family
[09:52:06] <Cultist> although there are more expats living here than there are natives, so maybe it's only the actual citizens who wear them
[09:53:09] <Adnauseam> it'll change - the world's not living in the year 3000 yet, but we will someday
[09:53:29] <Adnauseam> it's all pretty linear and a matter of time - this seems to be nature's way
[09:53:49] <KaMii> i love this song gangnam style, lol

[09:54:21] <Adnauseam> it hasa very nice rythem
[09:54:59] <KaMii> fun to dance to
[09:55:11] <ventYl> but... afaik full body burkhas aren't social norm
[09:55:27] <ventYl> except in some ultra orthodox group
[09:55:37] <KaMii> in the town i was living in in Sweden... like there were a ton of burkhas
[09:55:45] <KaMii> they just sorta showed up in a 5 year period
[09:55:49] <Cultist> I've noticed that it really depends on how wealthy the country is
[09:55:57] <KaMii> when we left, i felt like I was in mini-bahgdad
[09:56:02] <KaMii> i actually called it that...
[09:56:07] <Cultist> if the entire country is living in poverty, it tends to be horribly oppressive
[09:56:17] <Adnauseam> ventYl: true
[09:56:20] <KaMii> and peopel said i was being racist, and i was like, im sorry but i dont feel like im in sweden
[09:56:41] <Adnauseam> ventYl: but in saudio arabia they are a social norm
[09:56:42] <Cultist> but when you look at oil states with a high standard of living, the religious oppression is in the background, if it's there at all
[09:56:58] <Cultist> with the notable exception of Saudi Arabia
[09:57:04] <KaMii> what about kuwait?
[09:57:08] <KaMii> they cant have alcohol
[09:57:13] <Cultist> true
[09:57:16] <Cultist> a horrible, horrible truth
[09:57:23] <Adnauseam> KaMii: it;'s fine.. you can experss disagreement.. i wouldf if i were you, too
[09:57:24] <Cultist> but aside from that it's pretty westernized
[09:57:25] <KaMii> Cultist: is that you thats there?
[09:57:28] <Cultist> yeah
[09:57:34] <KaMii> i just remember someone said that the other day in here
[09:58:12] <Cultist> there's no alcohol and Ramadan is a pain in the ass, but aside from that it's a fairly secular country
[09:58:19] <KaMii> Adnauseam: i mean i understand why they were in sweden, because there was a war in iraq, but like all I could ever think was... why come to sweden of all places, our climate and culture is the exact opposite of iraq
[09:58:24] <KaMii> it just didnt make sense to me
[09:58:43] <Adnauseam> KaMii: as an arab living in germany for the past 3 yars i have noticed certains things
[09:58:51] <KaMii> Cultist: trust me, I know a lot about ramadan now, my town in sweden pretty much celebrated it before i left
[09:58:53] phe (~phe@wikimedia/phe) joined ##slackware.
[09:59:13] <Cultist> eating or drinking anything at all in public lands you in jail til the end of Ramadan
[09:59:33] <KaMii> jail?
[09:59:35] <Cultist> yep.
[09:59:45] <Cultist> off the installation anyway
[09:59:45] <KaMii> forced religion....
[10:00:30] <Cultist> and lunch break is about over, back to work
[10:00:35] Action: Cultist enters lurkymode
[10:00:40] <KaMii> lol
[10:01:02] <KaMii> but i think people live very comfortable in kuwait
[10:01:09] <KaMii> isnt everyone rich?
[10:01:16] <Cultist> the citizens are
[10:01:19] <KaMii> i heard everyone gets oil money
[10:01:20] <Cultist> Kuwait is filthy rich
[10:01:27] <KaMii> yea, thats what i heard
[10:01:29] <Cultist> no one has to work if they don't want to, if they're a Kuwaiti citizen
[10:01:31] <Adnauseam> KaMii: they move there with good intents, usually first gen. are ok. but second gen gets starts to identify with their "otherness" and in turn become slightly radicalized and start to "rediscover" their cultural traits and apply them - instead of integrating. that said, it's really difficult to integrate when you're seen as "other" which is pretty common. i think integration could be made easy but sadly it's done very badly everywhere
[10:01:48] <Cultist> the people who do all the work are the Indians and Pakistanis and such who move here for work
[10:02:24] <Cultist> anyway, really going now.
[10:02:29] Action: Cultist really lurking this time
[10:02:37] <Adnauseam> aye work mode engaged here too
[10:02:43] <KaMii> Adnauseam: yea, we had like 3 murders in my town and it was something like the first murder in sweden in 5 years or something, i cant remember, but murder didnt happen often in sweden, then all of a sudden it just kept happeneing a lot in my town
[10:02:54] <KaMii> and i was there like 5 minutes just before the murder...
[10:03:11] <Adnauseam> KaMii: sadly europe isn't ready for this. and this is happening at an accelerated rate due to the wars in those countie
[10:03:13] <KaMii> police came and asked me if I saw anything, but i didnt, it was really bad
[10:03:14] <Adnauseam> contries
[10:03:21] <Adnauseam> otherness leads to poverty
[10:03:32] <KaMii> yea, sweden wasnt ready, i know that
[10:03:32] <Adnauseam> due to faulty language acquisition
[10:03:41] <Adnauseam> less chances = crime
[10:03:57] <KaMii> they just let these people in and didnt tell the citizens .... at least inform us
[10:04:13] <Adnauseam> yeah countries are\were naive
[10:04:18] <Adnauseam> everyone should be more like france
[10:04:29] <CommaCrazy> hahhaha france?
[10:04:31] <Adnauseam> "now you listen here, moron, these are my rules."
[10:04:33] <CommaCrazy> why
[10:04:41] <KaMii> then the town govenment said, well we need to help them, they are just refugees, they will not stay long,
[10:04:47] <CommaCrazy> in Paris u cant find a pure french person
[10:04:57] <Adnauseam> i know france issues in the south of france, but france is pretty unapologetic when it comes to its secularity
[10:05:02] <KaMii> 5 years later they said, well the USA is still at war... and now some have applied for assylum,
[10:05:18] <KaMii> yea i did summer schools in paris
[10:05:19] <CommaCrazy> that is true
[10:05:28] <KaMii> paris is very multi cultural
[10:05:29] <Adnauseam> KaMii: yeah, naive handlnigs and poor knowledge of human nature
[10:05:50] <Adnauseam> politicians making the decisions, not scientists, sadly
[10:06:01] <KaMii> Adnauseam: you know whats sad though, they put these people in houses with no furnature, heat, electricity, or clothing during the winter in sweden
[10:06:09] <KaMii> and when our town heard about it, there was almost a riot
[10:06:14] <CommaCrazy> Well in this pos country that I live in the people are tired of revolting and the government=mafia
[10:06:23] <CommaCrazy> so the people can't do jack
[10:06:26] <KaMii> and we were like, This is not sweden, we dont do this, but why is the government doing it?
[10:06:29] <Adnauseam> CommaCrazy: italy ? ? :p
[10:06:35] <CommaCrazy> worse

[10:07:06] <Adnauseam> the east of europe will change.
[10:07:10] <Adnauseam> slowly
[10:07:17] <KaMii> i have a lot of friends from serbia, croatia, montenegro
[10:07:20] <Adnauseam> peopel are always too afraid.
[10:07:27] <KaMii> they arent swedish, but they were born in sweden
[10:07:35] <CommaCrazy> Yeah people in this area are very friendly
[10:07:42] <KaMii> their parents moved there during the wars, and never went home
[10:07:47] <ventYl> CommaCrazy: you aren't that bad on it
[10:08:13] <KaMii> becasue they had kids, their kids know swedish better than their parents language, so the parents stayed in sweden to raise the kids
[10:08:22] <Adnauseam> KaMii: home is where the heart is :p after your children are born somewhere.. it's pretty much impossible to "go home", because for your children.. they are home
[10:08:23] <ventYl> your only advantage and also disadvantage is that you are not part of EU

[13:08:54] <bedtime> KaMii, lol. about 2/3 months ago, yes, i saw sevaral bugs

[13:09:46] <pi31415> the ones where perceived criticism = ban
[13:09:48] <KaMii> not my problem, i was just reporting
[13:09:51] <Crosma> All of my fave software is buggy.
[13:10:11] <KaMii> but i cant remember if they banned me or i just gave up and left
[13:10:19] <bedtime> cromsma, it shouldn't be buggy right now; e17
[13:10:32] <Crosma> You'd think it wouldn't be buggy after more than a decade, no
[13:10:34] shothex1 (~shothex@95.104.62.209) joined ##slackware.
[13:10:37] <fuzzix> pi31415: I was asked to leave #xchat after robustly pointing out that hardcoding a server list inside code might be a bit cack.
[13:10:37] <hackedhead> but it is.
[13:10:38] <KaMii> s/shouldn't/will be
[13:10:47] <teamedward> Crosma, you could say that about Windows too
[13:11:02] <KaMii> for me, e17 has been around too long to still have minor bugs and issues
[13:11:07] <KaMii> so it will always be buggy
[13:11:07] <hackedhead> ^
[13:11:32] <bedtime> i notice that some features are not fully implimented, like in the e17 terminal, but what is there seems to work
[13:11:44] <KaMii> well they keep trying to do major changes and fixes and ignoring all the minor things that just build up too much to make the think useless
[13:11:48] <hackedhead> dwm: or how i learned to stop feature-hunting and love simplicity.
[13:12:04] <KaMii> i also saw they were really hunting and begging for people to show up to their conference
[13:12:06] <pi31415> fuzzix, that does sound like cack
[13:12:08] <bedtime> works for me, and for me its solid]
[13:12:13] <KaMii> something like, if people didnt show, they will just cancel it
[13:12:21] <bedtime> i'm on e17 right now
[13:12:22] <KaMii> i was like, wow talk about a dead project
[13:12:35] <pi31415> fuzzix, kind of like how the selection context menu in Seamonkey mail has "Search Google" hardcoded in, right next to Copy
[13:12:46] <bedtime> e17, and then kde, are the only desktops i'll use
[13:12:46] <KaMii> if you cant get people to your conference, i would say, just abandon it because no one is using it
[13:12:51] <Crosma> E17 was probably a bit too ambitious.
[13:13:09] <Crosma> I do love it though.
[13:13:11] <fuzzix> pi31415: Does it search your default search engine or specifically Google?
[13:13:14] <systemd_suxX> e17 is not dead! There was a new release a vew months ago
[13:13:17] <pi31415> specifically Google
[13:13:21] <bedtime> please remember that it was in BETA when you tried it :/
[13:13:21] <KaMii> well thats another thing, how many times are they going to change the name?  isnt it time for them to call it e19 yet?
[13:13:31] <bedtime> yep systemd_suxX
[13:13:40] <KaMii> bedtime: its been in beta longer than ive been alive
[13:13:46] <hackedhead> KaMii: but they haven't fixed all the bugs in 17 yet!  =P

[13:14:17] <ruskie> hehe
[13:14:20] <bedtime> :/
[13:14:22] <fuzzix> Yeah, eye candy crap.
[13:14:25] <hackedhead> it's been called e17 for at least 6 years, iirc
[13:14:31] <KaMii> lol bedtime no i liked the idea, but it was just never usable for me
[13:14:55] <bedtime> my gosh, sounds like you guys just wanna vent your frustrations because 6 months ago when it was in beta it didnt work perfectly for you :/

[13:16:23] <ruskie> my main gripe about e17 was the lack of customizability... beyond that... can't say I hit any bugs
[13:16:34] <KaMii> ruskie: exactly!!!!
[13:16:41] <bedtime> i'm looking for the bugs. KaMii, like i said, been using for a few months and since about a month ago its been solid

[13:16:55] <hackedhead> hahaha
[13:16:55] <KaMii> but there were a lot of bugs with thier *this should work* functions that never worked
[13:16:56] <ruskie> fuzzix, e always did iirc
[13:17:09] <fuzzix> Looks like something Tim Westwood would wear on his fingers.
[13:17:10] <bedtime> ruskie, lack of customisability??? you must be joking. clearly that is sarcasm
[13:17:11] <teamedward> it actually reminds me of old winamp skin
[13:17:12] <ruskie> anyway I'm sticking to fvwm myself
[13:17:14] <hackedhead> fuzzix: that's a feature.

[13:17:56] <KaMii> its why i like xfce, i can do what i want with it, and it doesnt fight back
[13:18:02] <teamedward> but if you want to get it to segault try launching something from an Everything added to a panel
[13:18:02] <bedtime> ruskie, well, as far as i see there are TOO many options

[13:18:48] <pi31415> fuzzix, i was wrong, it uses the default search engine
[13:18:50] <KaMii> or if you can do it, they have a really bad system on figuring out how to make it happen
[13:18:50] <teamedward> it doesn't even let you not do it gracefully
[13:19:21] <ruskie> I recall I was doing some cmd line thingies at the time to get some stuff I wanted
[13:19:28] <fuzzix> pi31415: That's a little more useful

[13:20:13] <KaMii> bedtime: does it support a fully transparent terminal session?
[13:20:26] <KaMii> because last time i tried, that was impossible
[13:20:31] <bedtime> KaMii, i'm not sure what 'transperent' is?
[13:20:31] <ruskie> I did run e17 on my eeepc701 for a while as well
[13:20:35] <ruskie> that wal like a year ago
[13:20:42] <ruskie> I must say it was better...
[13:20:45] <pi31415> fuzzix, seamonkey does not allow you to remove all search engines, and I don't see an option to add a "null" search engine
[13:20:45] <hackedhead> i always find myself muttering "drag? windows?  can't you just lay them out nicely for me? this is tedious...."
[13:20:50] <ruskie> but still not what I wanted
[13:21:04] <hackedhead> and then i just maximize everything for simplicity.
[13:21:12] <ruskie> pi31415, you add any search engine then you should be able to remove the other one
[13:21:22] <bedtime> you can have e17 do that automatically
[13:21:22] <ruskie> even if that search engine is just a localhost/something
[13:21:23] <teamedward> why would you want a fully transparent terminal?
[13:21:27] <fuzzix> pi31415: So misclick and you send a password of to teh goog.
[13:21:34] <KaMii> bedtime: like this:  http://dl.dropbox.com/u/71952729/Screenshot%20-%2001112013%20-%2005%3A14%3A04%20AM.png  <--- see my irssi session?  transparent

[13:27:36] <systemd_suxX> KaMii, what language is that?
[13:27:48] <pi31415> kamilla sounds like tea
[13:28:09] <KaMii> no, camilla was some warrior princess in italy or something, i forgot

[13:40:52] <systemd_suxX> KaMii, like your Nick ;-)

[13:41:40] <KaMii> but opis is so much cooler than aqua man
[13:41:56] <KaMii> s/is/are
[13:42:25] <KaMii> idk i get all confused with the roman mythology
[13:42:51] <KaMii> or greeek, or whatever
[13:42:54] <KaMii> haha
[13:43:24] <KaMii> ya, i was right the first time, roman mythology
[13:43:24] <systemd_suxX> KaMii, personally I would prefer a sea nymph instead of poseidon too ;)
[13:43:45] <KaMii> systemd_suxX: yea, but would you really name your daughter after a sea nymph?
[13:44:15] <Urchlay> I've heard of people being named Oenone... which was a wood nymph from Greek mythology
[13:44:22] <ventYl> here, some people name their children after TV show characters :))
[13:44:36] <KaMii> i get confused because i think Opis was a greek mythology and Camilla was roman mythology, but the story inter weaves
[13:44:40] <systemd_suxX> KaMii, that depends on how the nymph looks like, if she is sexy I might consider that, LOL (no just kidding)
[13:44:55] <KaMii> hahaha
[13:45:28] <KaMii> ok wikipedia is soo wrong....
[13:45:35] <Urchlay> ventYl: named your kid James (after captain kirk) wouldn't be too horrible. Naming him Frylock would be.
[13:46:14] <KaMii> She is called on by the goddess Diana to avenge the death of the Amazon-like female warrior Camilla   <-- amazon like?  that was during B.C.E and the amazon wasnt even discoverd by europeans yet, so they cant say that

[13:48:07] <ventYl> characters from south american soap operas
[13:48:18] <KaMii> name your daughter consuela after the mexican maid in family guy
[13:48:25] <Urchlay> ah. They're also actual names though
[13:48:40] <ventYl> but not in central europe :)
[13:48:45] <BrokenCog> actually, wasn't Amazon in S.A named after the mythos of Amazonia in Greek myth?

[13:50:24] cfdisk (~cfdisk@unaffiliated/cfdisk) joined ##slackware.
[13:50:37] <KaMii> so the amazons from greek mythology was actually a place in modern day ukraine
[13:50:42] <BrokenCog> one must remember where America's names came from ...  ( refer back to your "Europeans" comment)
[13:51:01] <BrokenCog> ah.  because those 6 foot tall russian chicks are so ...
[13:51:05] <BrokenCog> um.
[13:51:11] <BrokenCog> Ukrainian.
[13:51:17] <Urchlay> except the american names that came from the native languages... that all the white people mispronounce horribly
[13:51:22] <KaMii> BrokenCog: america came from Americus
[13:51:44] <NightTiger> I thought it was Amerigo Vespucci, the explorer?
[13:51:53] <Urchlay> how'd that guy get the continent named after him? he wasn't the first european to discover the place
[13:51:55] <BrokenCog> Urchlay: true.  they used the native names because the French didn't know the English names and the English didn't know the French names ... so they used the common Native
[13:52:12] <BrokenCog> Vespucci.
[13:52:24] <NightTiger> Good PR?
[13:52:25] <BrokenCog> an honoriffic given by a devottee ...
[13:52:53] <KaMii> i thought vespuccis first name was americus
[13:52:55] <Urchlay> BrokenCog: there's a story that the name "Apache" comes from explorers asking a tribe of indians "What do you call the tribe that lives across the river?", and their answer was "Apache", meaning "The enemy" in their language. Wonder if that's true.
[13:53:18] <Urchlay> people back then used to latinize their names
[13:53:20] <BrokenCog> like "Armstrong Crater" on the moon.
[13:53:27] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea, leif was the first european
[13:53:39] <Urchlay> columbus IIRC was columbo in Spanish
[13:53:57] <BrokenCog> Urchlay: probably.  Cherookee call themselves Nermurnu (sp) ... "The People"
[13:54:05] <BrokenCog> which is actually a common naming.
[13:54:05] <KaMii> yea, christoph colombo
[13:54:12] <Urchlay> heh, I'm part cherokee and I didn't know that.
[13:54:39] <Urchlay> (not sure what part. Apparently not my liver, I can hold my liquor... some of my relatives can't)

[13:54:56] <KaMii> Urchlay: theres like a million ways to spell his name apparently
[13:55:12] <BrokenCog> Urchlay: just finished reading "Empire of the Summer Moon".  realyl good read.
[13:55:21] <Urchlay> like Shakespeare. Shaksper. Shakspear... he used to spell it however he felt
[13:55:24] <systemd_suxX> Urchlay, no offense but americans usually don#t know much about world history - because they are too arrogant to care about where they came from
[13:55:27] <KaMii> you actually paid for a hippie book?
[13:55:51] <BrokenCog> KaMii: you don't read ... so /ignore Kamii, :content => "book"
[13:56:05] <Urchlay> systemd_suxX: eh, I know some world history, but it's patchy (I read fiction, get interested in the stuff it's based on, and read about that)

[13:56:37] <BrokenCog> game of polit
[13:56:45] <BrokenCog> ahh ... a true story if ever one.
[13:56:55] <KaMii> lol i like it
[13:57:02] <BrokenCog> ... actually, it's just a retelling of Shakespears King Lear.  With Dragons.
[13:57:16] <KaMii> shakespear is boring
[13:57:20] <KaMii> and dont ruin it for me
[13:57:38] <BrokenCog> what's not to like.  Fighting Women, Men on Horses, Midgets.
[13:57:52] <BrokenCog> KaMii: couldn't ... only read the first book.
[13:58:05] <Urchlay> ...also with simplified nobility. Everyone but the King is just a Lord, the reader doesn't have to remember whether a baron outranks a duke or not...
[13:58:30] <KaMii> doenst really matter anyway
[13:58:30] <BrokenCog> Urchlay: true.  so, it dumbed down Shakespeare.
[13:58:37] <KaMii> they just war with eachother either way
[13:58:44] <systemd_suxX> Urchlay, I am not saying that you don#t know world history I am saying that MOST of the americans just don't care about
[13:58:45] <Urchlay> (which is good, 'cause as an American, I really don't know that stuff worth a damn, and would have to consciously pay attention to it)
[13:59:27] <BrokenCog> systemd_suxX: most people don't care about "world history" ... people are about as xenophobic as any other ...
[13:59:41] <KaMii> Urchlay: and a duke totally outwighs a baron by a lot
[13:59:44] <Urchlay> systemd_suxX: most americans are ignorant. I kinda thought most humans are that way, but maybe it's just us.
[13:59:49] <KaMii> well by 3 places
[14:00:08] <Urchlay> KaMii: I actually knew that at one time (from reading Dune probably)
[14:00:15] <KaMii> lol yea
[14:00:17] <KaMii> i like dune
[14:00:28] <BrokenCog> Europeans say they know world histroy because Brits know some French history, Italians know some Greek ... that's like New Yorkers knowing a bit about Jersey.   I find 'non-Americans' know about as much world history as 'Americans'

[14:03:25] <Urchlay> who's got time for reading? we've got commercials to watch!
[14:03:28] <KaMii> why read when you have reality tv?

[14:04:23] <KaMii> people didnt even know where sweden was when i came to a US high school
[14:04:31] <KaMii> then i had to explain its in europe

[14:04:43] <BrokenCog> your what?
[14:04:45] <Urchlay> systemd_suxX: I'm 40. When I was in high school, yes, they did teach world history. Most of it was western european history, not much about eastern europe (they were teh eeevil communists! back then of course), and nothing about africa...
[14:04:54] <BrokenCog> true.
[14:04:59] <ventYl> and what about countries small as czech republic, clovakia, serbia, etc?: )

[14:05:34] <BrokenCog> couldn't say what the topic is like now ...
[14:05:42] <KaMii> it didnt break up until 1995?
[14:05:49] <Urchlay> I knew better anyway. I knew a couple of Russians and they didn't have horns or tails or pitchforks.
[14:05:58] <ventYl> 1993
[14:06:10] <Urchlay> (they did have vodka, but to a teenage kid that just made them cooler)

[14:07:35] <Urchlay> KaMii: maybe the real reason they split the country in half is that nobody can spell czechoslovakia?

[14:07:52] <KaMii> Urchlay: haha
[14:09:27] <Urchlay> someone tried to explain that to me... according to him, most of the languages from places like bulgaria or ukraine were close enough to russian that they're almost more like dialects (the way Yankee and Deep South are, in english)

[14:11:24] <ananke> but there is much more difference than the accents in usa
[14:11:58] <KaMii> systemd_suxX: well yea some do, because they were forced to learn it during communist rule
[14:11:59] <Urchlay> more like, maybe, italian and spanish? (both descended from latin, similar-sounding to a foreigner who doesn't understand either)
[14:12:16] <ventYl> yep
[14:12:30] <KaMii> but yea, russian is too different from czech

[14:15:20] <Urchlay> no, I was planning to take my required 2 years of foreign language, and I'd already failed Spanish (due to crappy teaching, by a teacher who didn't even speak the damn language)
[14:15:41] <Urchlay> the only other choice was French, and I knew I'd never get the accent right
[14:15:49] <KaMii> Urchlay: just take canadian
[14:15:50] <KaMii> hahaha
[14:16:05] <KaMii> or australian

[14:26:02] <Urchlay> I think the doctrine was, the king wasn't king until crowned by the pope... but the pope couldn't just give the king orders (he had to be polite, but could excommunicate the whole kingdom, which apparently was a big deal back then)

[14:43:46] <bedtime> the desktop shot program took the photo and uploaded it directly to the e17 site. so easy
[14:43:50] <Urchlay> that's why I don't use transparency
[14:43:52] <bedtime> yep
[14:44:14] <KaMii> i like transparency
[14:44:17] <bedtime> but even the menu has transperancy as you see. the borders can have transperancy as well
[14:44:27] <Urchlay> (not using transparency also means I don't have to choose a background, because it's almost never visible anyway)
[14:44:28] <bedtime> also depends on the theme
[14:44:50] <bedtime> i usually just use a black background or plain black with a small logo

[14:51:59] <Urchlay> the harder you turn the crank, the more buzzing you get (and I guess the louder everything is)
[14:52:17] <Urchlay> if my guitar made a noise like that, I'd take it to the luthier to get it fixed :)

[14:53:48] <Urchlay> not acoustic guitars
[14:54:15] <KaMii> lol Urchlay that guy really is rocking out on the hurdy gurdy
[14:54:28] <Urchlay> though I can remember a kid I knew (we were both maybe 14), trying to make his acoustic guitar distory, by putting tin foil on the bridge
[14:54:39] <Urchlay> (it sounded like crap, as you'd expect)
[14:54:59] <KaMii> now he plays for creed?
[14:55:05] <KaMii> lol
[14:55:09] <KaMii> couldnt resist
[14:55:11] <Urchlay> he plays for crack, probably

[15:01:05] <KaMii> close enough, but that instrument
[15:01:11] <KaMii> its not a violin
[15:01:30] <KaMii> Urchlay: yea i worked for a boss like that, and he fired me
[15:01:41] <KaMii> apparently dancing on the tables at a coffee shop gets you fired
[15:01:59] <Urchlay> KaMii: not sure what that is
[15:02:17] <KaMii> well its the same instruemnt thats all through braveheart
[15:02:18] <KaMii> and i like it
[15:02:19] <teamedward> i'd have said 'but how else was i to avoid the rampant rats and cockroaches?' as i stormed out and made a scene

[15:02:43] <KaMii> lol
[15:02:47] <KaMii> i was having fun
[15:02:58] <Urchlay> KaMii: haven't seen braveheart in a while, IIRC there's lots of bagpipes in the soundtrack
[15:03:01] <KaMii> if work isnt fun, then there is no point in going
[15:03:19] <KaMii> but there are tons of different types of bagpipes
[15:04:19] <Urchlay> eh, if everyone thought that way, who'd fix your car when it breaks, or swamp out the sewer when it starts backing up, or pick up your garbage and take it to the dump?

[15:16:44] <c0mpo> Having an issue where I can't send mail by accessing a test_mail.php script from the web browser. This script contains a simple call to mail();. I can send mail by doing 'php test_mail.php' in a command line. Any ideas?
[15:17:25] <Urchlay> when you try it from the command line, are you doing it as the same user the web server runs as?
[15:17:46] <c0mpo> No. The web server is running as apache and i'm logged in under my normal user account.
[15:17:49] <KaMii> anyone in here live in the portland oregon area?  and did the ground just shake?
[15:17:59] <Urchlay> that could be the problem
[15:18:05] <Urchlay> (or not, but you have to try it to find out)
[15:18:12] <Crosma> I farted, KaMii.
[15:18:14] <c0mpo> I thought that could be the problem. But I don't know where to go from here :)
[15:18:23] Action: nofra lights a match
[15:18:40] <Urchlay> also, turn on php errors/warnings, see if there's anything relevant there... and check /var/log/maillog

[15:19:23] <c0mpo> I don't see any PHP errors in the httpd logs
[15:19:28] <KaMii> nothing for this region
[15:19:28] <nofra> c0mpo: check your httpd error logs, prolly still a permission
[15:19:32] <Urchlay> these are just sorta general ideas, I haven't used php in a few years & don't remember details too well
[15:19:35] <c0mpo> and I don't see any record of the mail even trying to be sent in the maillog
[15:19:42] <KaMii> i swear i felt the ground shake
[15:19:54] <Urchlay> c0mpo: isn't there a php.ini setting to send errors/warnings to the browser? temporarily turn that on?
[15:20:13] <ventYl> KaMii: heavy truck or something?
[15:20:21] <c0mpo> Normally if you put a mail() call in a php script it takes a couple seconds to execute. It takes a couple seconds from the command line. But when I load the script in the web browser, it instantly executes and mail() outputs a TRUE value
[15:20:27] <KaMii> there it went again
[15:20:31] <nofra> c0mpo: look in your /var/log/httpd logs
[15:20:35] <Urchlay> KaMii: that's my cousin Sasquatch, talking a shortcut through your back yard

[15:20:43] <KaMii> lol
[15:20:46] <c0mpo> Urchlay: i have error logging turned on. nothing.
[15:21:05] <c0mpo> nofra: i checked those. it doesn't show any errors ,notices, or warnings
[15:21:13] <Crosma> Is your sendmail daemon running?
[15:21:15] <Urchlay> ok, does php.ini have any sort of verbose or debug setting?
[15:21:17] <c0mpo> the script is executing successfully but nothing is being sent
[15:21:27] <c0mpo> Crosma: yes of course. if i run the same script from the command line, it works fine.
[15:21:33] <Crosma> Oh, I see.
[15:21:56] <Urchlay> yeah. Try it as the apache user (or whatever apache's running as). You can "su - apache" if you're root, and get a shell as that user
[15:22:02] <c0mpo> Urchlay: you can only set what level of error reportin gyou want. Mine is as verbose as possible
[15:22:10] <Crosma> Yeah, it could be a user permissions problem of some kind.
[15:22:37] <c0mpo> If i type su apache, it doesn't change the user.
[15:22:42] <Urchlay> su - apache
[15:22:46] <Urchlay> the dash is important
[15:22:48] <nofra> c0mpo: you trying to send email from a webscript?
[15:23:00] <Urchlay> also, it pays to look up the PHP documentation for the mail() function. It should at least give you an idea of what that function actually does.
[15:23:23] <c0mpo> Urchlay: i know how the mail() function works. 'su - apache' still leaves me logged in as root
[15:23:35] <thumbs> su -c
[15:23:41] <c0mpo> nofra: if you're going to tell me that it should be queued and mailed from a cron job, then no. i'm not :)
[15:23:44] <Urchlay> if "su - apache" doesn't seem to change the user, it's probably because the apache user's shell is set to something like /bin/false
[15:23:52] <nofra> c0mpo: nope
[15:24:01] <Urchlay> maybe something like: su - apache -c /bin/bash -login

[15:29:10] <nofra> e-mail is the tool of the devil
[15:29:25] <ananke> thumbs: exactly. for most folks deploying postfix today is an easier task than sendmail
[15:29:34] <Urchlay> as long as it doesn't emulate its rewrite rule syntax. I'd rather drive rusty nails through my kneecaps than mess with that again
[15:30:00] <ananke> don't get me wrong, i use sendmail. but my level of familiarity with sendmail doesn't translate to new users. the learning curve is a bit too steep
[15:30:25] <thumbs> ananke: I've used postfix for 6+ years, so I can't see myself suddently jumping to sendmail
[15:30:41] <Crosma> postfix can handle way more load than sendmail too.

[15:47:02] <NightTiger> Urchlay:  Hand-hacking sendmail.cf is always a bad idea. MUCH better to use the m4 configs.
[15:47:06] <Urchlay> (one bolt to hold it in place was all I needed to fix it)
[15:47:42] <Urchlay> NightTiger: yeah, I agree. But I know (or used to know) an old-school unix hacker who would disagree with you.
[15:48:04] <Urchlay> I didn't understand his rewrite rules well enough to critique them, maybe they were better than what m4 would spit out, maybe not
[15:48:33] <NightTiger> Urchlay:  The guy who wrote Sendmail suggests treating the .cf as though it was a binary - even he doesn't mess with it.

[16:38:30] <ananke> actually, titles do matter
[16:38:53] <nofra> Pay > title
[16:38:58] <ananke> they often do indicate progress of career and responsibilities
[16:39:12] <ananke> nofra: i'm not debating whether pay matters or not, or which one is more important
[16:39:40] <eviljames> Urchlay: I agree and disagree with some of your points
[16:39:40] <ananke> when the time comes to find a new job, having those titles does matter
[16:39:44] <Urchlay> yeah, but not when they're made up imaginary titles that don't have a definition...
[16:39:49] <eviljames> I'd agree with ananke in the titles matter
[16:39:56] <eviljames> for that exact reason.
[16:40:09] <ananke> Urchlay: systems architect is a fairly well estabilished position
[16:40:23] <nofra> Titles mean squat....  I had one title officially, the company told our customer that I had another title....  I put on my resume the title that matches my job   and my boss (who's a reference agrees with my resume)
[16:40:27] <ananke> it is a departure from engineering though
[16:40:29] <eviljames> but I also would prefer my own title to be something better than 'system architect' or whatever
[16:41:05] <ananke> nofra: if they mean squat, why did you bother putting something that you _thought was better_?
[16:41:05] <eviljames> 'director of intangibles'
[16:41:08] <Urchlay> yeah... I didn't want "web engineer" as a title, it sounds horrible, plus I was raised to believe you don't call yourself an engineer unless you have an engineering degree
[16:41:18] <nofra> ananke: I put what more closely matched
[16:41:18] <eviljames> web engineer is horrible, it's true.
[16:41:21] <nofra> Not better
[16:41:27] <ananke> Urchlay: systems engineer is a well known title too :)
[16:41:36] <Urchlay> yeah, that one I've heard of
[16:41:41] <nofra> and the only reason I add them to the resume is because pin-head hiring ppl care
[16:41:51] <ananke> nofra: so you obviously did think it mattered what you put
[16:42:10] <ananke> nofra: and we're back to square one, where you actually agree with my point :)
[16:42:13] <nofra> To get hired, it does matter...  past that, not so much
[16:42:23] <ananke> 11:32  ananke> when the time comes to find a new job, having those titles does matter
[16:42:32] <nofra> Once you are employed, titles mean squat

[16:44:45] <nofra> HA HA!
[16:44:49] <nofra> Yes, a resume
[16:45:04] <nofra> Just as false as job requirements
[16:45:05] <ananke> nofra: uhmm, i guess you have never witnessed somebody being fired for falsifying their resume
[16:45:14] <nofra> Personally no
[16:45:28] <Urchlay> I've never witnessed it, even when I caught them myself and complained to the boss
[16:45:28] <ananke> hope it won't happen to you, but rest assure, this happens. i've seen it many times.
[16:45:55] <ananke> then again, i do work for the state, so things like this are usually taken seriously
[16:45:55] <nofra> For things like electrician, mediacl doctors, etc, I can see it

[16:47:23] <Urchlay> it wasn't subjective. He literally was incapable of writing a simple piece of code to a simple spec. I tried to help him, even (without actually doing the work for him)
[16:47:23] <nofra> Fact of the matter is....  for most jobs no one ever got fired for falsifying a resume...  What they got fired for was screwing up and falsifiying the resume was the excuse
[16:47:47] <Urchlay> "X years experience with Java programming" was definitely on his resume, and he definitely had no Java experience, based on his performance
[16:47:58] <Urchlay> (can't remember what X was, maybe 3)
[16:48:00] <ananke> Urchlay: 'i can code' is subjective. 'i graduated XYZ' or 'i have no criminal record' are not

[16:50:18] <ananke> Urchlay: when it comes to gov't/state jobs, they're usually pretty good sticklers when it comes to rules
[16:50:32] <Urchlay> (well, a clearinghouse or e-tailer or WTFever they call themselves, aggregator of multiple bg checking services)
[16:51:39] <Urchlay> ah, I know nothing about government jobs... well, except my cousin worked for DEFACS and quit because it depressed her (almost but not quite entirely unrelated to this conversation)
[16:51:51] <nofra> I stand by my contention that any manager who fires a good producer because his resume title was fabricated deserves to have his business run into the ground because of poor decisions.
[16:52:16] <ananke> nofra: i think you fail to grasp the severity of the issue. it's not the _manager_ who fires the person. it's the organization
[16:52:29] <eviljames> nofra: typically that is the case.
[16:52:33] <Urchlay> eh, the job title at their previous employer?
[16:52:58] <nofra> Urchlay: Yeah, that's what we are discussing
[16:53:03] <eviljames> nofra: A manager's job is to accomplish goals through others.  If they're being petty about that sort of thing, odds are they aren't accomplishing much.
[16:53:12] <Urchlay> that seems waaay too easy to get caught doing, before you're ever hired
[16:53:16] <nofra> eviljames: Yep
[16:53:21] <eviljames> and, if there is a decent producer on the team, it doesn't matter what the background is, because they _are_ accomplishing much.
[16:53:22] <ananke> on a funny note, we've seen an employee who was let go, make up his resume on linkedin, and assume job title of his boss
[16:53:30] <eviljames> niiiice haha
[16:53:45] <eviljames> I've been told repeatedly to get a linkedin account, but I just can't be arsed
[16:53:45] <ananke> [which was in line of why he was let go]
[16:53:53] <nofra> ananke: THATS a go-getter!
[16:54:06] <eviljames> "I got promoted just before I left the organization!"
[16:54:09] <ananke> eviljames: it's a good way to keep in touch with coworkers/previous bosses/etc, when the time comes to finding a new job
[16:54:11] <nofra> eviljames: Linkedin is a waste of time
[16:54:32] <eviljames> I believe those are both true
[16:54:44] <ananke> because let's face it, good network of contacts will get you a job much faster than blindly prodding the market

[16:55:33] <ananke> Urchlay: facebook for employed folks. i don't buy into the update/etc part of it, but it's easy to keep your resume up-to-date on it, and be linked with people you know
[16:55:40] <Urchlay> the ones on facebook (that I've seen, which aren't that many) aren't funny either.

[16:56:20] <ananke> nofra: if you ever get a gov't/state/military job, you'll see that your manager won't be the one who deals with firings over falsified documents

[16:56:46] <nofra> I was military

[17:00:15] <nofra> 2) Every purchase has unbeleivable spec requirements

[17:35:15] <tsccof> ananke: I don't properly remember it now, but I can recall evaluating almost every single feature package managers should have, and it lacked many
[17:35:22] <tsccof> ananke: hang on, let me do some remembering
[17:35:31] <ananke> on a side note, i'd argue that lack of features does not qualify as 'stupid'. primitive, yes. stupid? not so much. stupid should be reserved for abnormal behavior

[17:37:48] <ananke> tsccof: uhmm, 4 places for configuration? are you talking about spec files or what?
[17:38:00] <tsccof> no, you can have an rpmrc in 4 different locations
[17:38:28] <ananke> tsccof: and that's a very normal behvior, often expected in enterprise level apps
[17:38:46] <ananke> The default FILELIST is /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc:/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc:/etc/rpmrc:~/.rpmrc. <- how is that a problem?
[17:39:23] <ananke> ability to have multiple config files is often a must. you have global config files, user specific ones, system default vs system custom, etc
[17:40:30] <alisonken1home> one example I can think of is at my last job - global config, then is it a dedicated server, a shared server, a multi-virtual server, or a mysql server to configure?
[17:40:54] <sungem> plus an on-time android config
[17:41:00] <ananke> for most software i expect the ability to have three sets of configs: 1) set of vanilla defaults [say in /usr/share, it gets modified with the package], 2) global config [admin managed, in /etc], 3) user config [in ~/.]

[17:41:55] <tsccof> ananke: that makes sense, but I can't see why you shouldn't have just one file in /etc and one in ~/
[17:42:00] <ananke> not to mention, there should be logic behind which config files take precedence: ~/ takes precedence over /etc, and /etc takes precedence over defaults
[17:42:21] TheM4ch1n3 (~shaun@41.48.16.54) joined ##slackware.
[17:42:48] <ananke> tsccof: package default. i expect software to have a set of defaults, in absence of set options in /etc/config
[17:42:55] <tsccof> rpm's dependencies relationships aren't as elaborate and as helpful as they could be
[17:43:17] <TommyC> Asking because ghostscript and ghostscript-fonts install stuff into the same /usr/share/ghostscript directories, and removing both doesn't remove the directory (since it'll leave files from the other package since removepkg detected new packages). Hence my "removepkg | tee output.log" to see which directories I actually need or not later.
[17:43:23] <tsccof> information such as conflicts, replaces, provides, suggests, etc
[17:43:29] <TommyC> Was wondering if anybody else did this and had a better alias or script to be aliased, etc.

[17:44:44] <ananke> tsccof: for example, look at '/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc' on any rpm based system. those are the defaults. most people leave that be, and they get updated as rpm package gets upgraded. IF there is ever a need to modify something globally, you'd put stuff in /etc/rpmrc, and that would override /usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc
[17:44:46] <tsccof> say 5 packages provide 'editor', when you try to install 'editor', the package manager asks you which one you wnat

[17:46:28] Oak (~Oak@unaffiliated/alreadygone) left irc: Client Quit
[17:46:34] <tsccof> sure, but since rpm's specs don't natively provide this layer of information, yum can't properly solve the problem
[17:46:43] <ananke> that's where yum, apt-get, aptitude, zypper, etc come into play: they store information about what's available in repositories. it's not package manager's job to know what's outside of the local system

[17:48:03] <tsccof> it does, as far as I can recall
[17:48:36] <tsccof> in case it doesn't, most users use it as a high-level interface to dpkg

[17:48:42] <tsccof> apt as a middle-level, and dpkg as low-level
[17:49:10] <tsccof> having a single-layer, that is concerned about general system integrity, package maintenance and management seems to be a huge advatange

[17:50:30] <tsccof> I think one of the reasons the Fedora community doesn't recommend direct upgrades via yum.. rpm isn't really well-suited for painless upgrades
[17:50:53] <ananke> when it comes down to it, often you have to drop to the lowest tier to fix things. wouldn't be the first time i had to fix things with rpm, dpkg, or installpkg/tar
[17:51:33] <ananke> tsccof: yet other communities use live rpm-based upgrade paths. for example suse with zypper
[17:52:20] <ananke> granted, you always run into the possibility of rpm package breaking rpm
[17:52:40] <tsccof> ananke: but I think opensuse's RPM is a fork

[17:55:04] <Skywise> everyone can install from source
[17:55:08] <ananke> tsccof: interesting question. i've never encountered a situation where a package wouldn't have files listed in its file list

[19:10:52] <BrokenCog> I understand, but would use webadmin.
[19:10:59] <eviljames> So, I guess there is a standard, but I don't think it defines group names so much as just reserves the GIDs

[19:24:49] <BogdanR> How about running it in a native 64bit env?
[19:25:46] <aceofspades19> BogdanR: I believe its only released as 32bit so it won't run in a pure 64bit environment
[19:26:32] <eviljames> BogdanR: You cannot run skype 64 on real 64
[19:26:34] <eviljames> because it's not 64
[19:26:46] <BogdanR> I was hoping I was wrong :)
[19:26:50] <BogdanR> Crap
[19:26:55] <eviljames> it's *actually* a 32 bit binary that triggers aptitude to install 32bit compat libs

[19:36:55] <aceofspades19> most proprietary applications are 32bit only in my experience
[19:38:02] <BogdanR> aceofspades19: but why?
[19:38:31] <aceofspades19> probably because they feel its not worth the money to develop a 64bit version
[19:38:33] <d4wnr4z0r> cheaper to target one platform, and 32-bit is the one of the two which works on both.
[19:39:38] <BogdanR> They made it work on ARM. To just make it work on 64bit it's most likely a matter of compiling it for 64bit.

[19:46:27] <Jdogzz> How speedy is it? I didn't like the one I used for a class in high school, but it was running Windows so that pretty much took up all its resources.
[19:47:04] <eviljames> I think it's fine.  Mine is atom dual core @ 1.5GHz w/ IIRC 2GB DDR2.  Slackware 14.0 w/ KDE and it's usually disk IO bound
[19:47:27] <eviljames> that is, it's slow to load somethign bulky, like chrome, but once it's in ram everything behaves as expected.
[19:47:33] <aceofspades19> dual core atoms are not bad
[19:47:41] <BogdanR> I also have an Atom one but the keyboard is way to small and I never use it for that reason.
[19:47:46] <eviljames> So perhaps a decent SSD would alleviate that problem.
[19:47:51] <aceofspades19> anything single core is pretty slow imo
[19:47:55] <eviljames> BogdanR: The HP mini 1010 is the first usable netbook keyboard I found

[21:02:59] <eviljames> Sandman1++
[21:03:05] <Sandman1> They are a company that loves to be hated
[21:03:10] <eviljames> Removing the distributor's license is one of the biggest dick moves I've ever seen a company make.
[21:03:22] <TheM4ch1n3> yea, Sun Microsystems used to be cool, until they got 'purchased'

[21:05:05] <eviljames> Their Java implementation is for them to distribute, everybody else can use openjdk
