[04:01:17] <n1x4> MOTHER OF GOD!!!!!! I lean back pretty heft in the recliner and hit the rack behind me.. Damn quart jar of canned tomaotoes hits me square in the head... Moving that thing in the AM
[04:01:19] <peaceblaster> alrighty, attempting to find .config now
[04:01:22] <shonudo> "and i was told something went wrong and to use a different kernel"???
[04:01:35] <shonudo> what rumor mill is this?
[04:01:51] <peaceblaster> shonudo: Yes, I was told to use 3.1 instead
[04:01:57] <n1x4> wireless driver issue
[04:02:01] <shonudo> by whom?
[04:02:02] <peaceblaster> ^
[04:02:05] <peaceblaster> um
[04:02:06] <n1x4> and it was 3.6.6 or later
[04:02:10] <shonudo> ah
[04:02:17] <peaceblaster> idr, sorry
[04:02:22] <shonudo> lol
[04:02:23] <shonudo> np
[04:02:26] <shonudo> not like you
[04:02:33] <shonudo> need to name names
[04:03:09] <peaceblaster> Also, will the new kernel likely support an NVidia GeForce GTX 550?

[04:03:21] <shonudo> if it doesn't, it's a 2.4 kernel
[04:03:37] <shonudo> (j/k)

[04:04:13] NitroGL (~NitroGL@gateway/tor-sasl/nitrogl) joined ##slackware.
[04:04:35] <peaceblaster> I mean it works, I jsut doesn't support my max res and doesn't recognize 2nd monitor
[04:04:51] <shonudo> that's not the work of the kernel
[04:05:03] <shonudo> that's the work for xorg.conf or xrandr
[04:05:36] <peaceblaster> ok, will deal with that later then
[04:05:58] <peaceblaster> so I'm in /usr/src/linux, and just made mrproper
[04:06:08] <peaceblaster> where should my .config be?
[04:06:50] <shonudo> the nvidia proprietary driver will make one for you
[04:06:54] <shonudo> that's one route
[04:07:03] <peaceblaster> tutorial says "cp /boot/config-generic-smp-$(uname -r) /usr/src/linux/.config" to use current as template
[04:07:18] <peaceblaster> my bad 'generic kernel' as template
[04:08:02] <shonudo> you're not talking about the one for nvidia... you mean the one for the kernel
[04:08:03] <peaceblaster> and I believe you said to use an alternate template?
[04:08:14] <shonudo> i didn't say that
[04:08:18] <peaceblaster> yeah, I'm not going to worry about graphics yet
[04:08:26] <peaceblaster> sorry, whomever I speaking to at the time
[04:08:41] <peaceblaster> (you plural)
[04:08:59] <n1x4> peaceblaster: there are many methods to grab a .config... Try following the guide for now
[04:09:12] <KaMii> peaceblaster: dont put it in /usr/src/linux
[04:09:20] <KaMii> thats a simlink that you never setup properly
[04:09:26] <peaceblaster> ok
[04:09:36] <KaMii> put it in /usr/src/linux-3.7.4/
[04:09:51] <peaceblaster> I have config-generic-3.7.1.x64 in my documents... shall I use that?
[04:09:54] <KaMii> but first you need to do make mrproper
[04:10:02] <peaceblaster> already made mrproper
[04:10:04] <KaMii> then put the template over and rename it to .config
[04:10:11] <peaceblaster> k
[04:10:12] <KaMii> and redo make menuconfig
[04:12:39] <peaceblaster> k, doing that now
[04:13:39] <peaceblaster> ok, this is the tutorial I've been using: http://blog.tpa.me.uk/slackware-kernel-compile-guide/ am I to just follow its steps for kernel configuration in this step?
[04:14:57] <KaMii> yes
[04:15:57] <peaceblaster> alrighty
[04:16:05] <n1x4> Brainfart..... What's rsync's equivalent to cp -L?
[04:16:57] <n1x4> nvm
[04:16:59] <n1x4> -l
[04:18:17] <peaceblaster> compiling
[04:18:40] <n1x4> shaaaaaawing
[04:18:49] <peaceblaster> done
[04:18:55] <n1x4> damnit
[04:19:04] <peaceblaster> (ran for about a mintue before I posted that, but was still REALLY fast)
[04:19:34] <n1x4> what dir did you compile in?
[04:20:03] <peaceblaster> /usr/src/linux-3.7.4
[04:20:41] <peaceblaster> I also noticed my config disappeared after renaming to ".config" using mv
[04:20:43] <KaMii> what directory is your .config file in=
[04:20:51] <KaMii> its suppose to
[04:20:57] <KaMii>  the . means its hidden
[04:21:01] <KaMii> ls -al
[04:21:04] <n1x4> ls -a will show it
[04:21:04] <KaMii> will show it
[04:21:08] <n1x4> ^
[04:21:13] <peaceblaster> same as current- /usr/src/linux-3.7.4
[04:21:32] <KaMii> did you put the config file in there then run make mrproper?
[04:21:48] <KaMii> because if you did that, then it deleted your config
[04:21:52] <peaceblaster> no, I moved the config after mrproper
[04:22:00] <KaMii> did you run make menuconfig?
[04:22:04] <peaceblaster> yes
[04:22:27] <KaMii> try again, next time make sure the .config file is there
[04:22:37] <peaceblaster> the first time it gave me errors about slackgcc not found, then I removed the LocalVersion and it ran
[04:22:41] <peaceblaster> ok
[04:23:05] <KaMii> then your config is messed up
[04:23:39] <TommyC> old but, has anybody else seen this rms video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcUQ7QHP_p0&feature=player_detailpage#t=1035s
[04:24:15] <peaceblaster> shall I try with the generic kernel as .config? (as the tutorial says)
[04:24:27] <shonudo> TommyC: yeah, saw the whole thing
[04:24:27] <TommyC> peaceblaster: That's probably best.
[04:24:30] <shonudo> total meltdown
[04:24:34] <TommyC> shonudo: indeed
[04:24:37] <peaceblaster> k
[04:24:45] <TommyC> I shouldn't have...but I laughed a little.
[04:24:54] <n1x4> peaceblaster's playing a cruel joke... He's secretly got liquid nitro cooling and he's OC'd to 6+ghz
[04:25:03] <peaceblaster> ^
[04:25:10] <KaMii> lol
[04:25:25] <KaMii> hes on the jaguar supercomputer
[04:25:32] <n1x4> HaHa
[04:25:54] <peaceblaster> Yeah I'm actually using a top-secret quantum computer over here at the pentagon
[04:26:08] <KaMii> you mean at CERN
[04:26:16] <TommyC> if I recall correctly, doesn't the pentagon own a supercomputer...or two (or maybe more)?
[04:26:23] <KaMii> the pentagon doesnt have an atomic processor
[04:26:35] <n1x4> Yea... Remember W.O.P.R
[04:26:42] <KaMii> lol
[04:26:45] <KaMii> joshua
[04:26:49] <n1x4> hell yea
[04:26:52] <Skywise> you'll never know what the pentagon has, but theres at least 3 levels lower then the 2 public basement levels
[04:26:54] <KaMii> i love how they identify him as the password
[04:27:09] <KaMii> Skywise: yea, because i havent given it to them yet
[04:27:12] <n1x4> Definitely
[04:27:25] <TommyC> Skywise: true, but I'd assume they have at least one supercomputer for decrypting messages from foreign governments
[04:27:42] <Skywise> they have a whole agency for that, the DIA
[04:27:57] <n1x4> I thought that was NSA
[04:28:05] <Skywise> thats what they want you to think
[04:28:14] <n1x4> Damnit... I knew it
[04:28:16] <TommyC> The NSA tells us what to think, we think it.
[04:28:19] <TommyC> That's what the NSA does.
[04:28:20] <n1x4> duped again
[04:28:33] <KaMii> DIA?

[04:28:44] <Skywise> defense intel agency
[04:28:46] <Skywise> yea
[04:29:08] <shonudo> and there's an EIA, an FIA, and GIA
[04:29:12] <KaMii> yea, fema and black helecopters

[04:30:05] <n1x4> Yea well I have a little answering machine here that can decrypt anything.. C-Tech Astronomy..
[04:30:18] <KaMii> cooteys rat semen?
[04:30:25] <peaceblaster> Someone told me earlier not to use a LocalVersion in menuconfig... should I use it anyway?
[04:30:29] <KaMii> i was going to watch that tonight
[04:30:32] <KaMii> maybe i still will
[04:30:44] <n1x4> Beat ya to it.... playing right now... :P

[04:30:58] <KaMii> well that or StrangeDays
[04:31:08] <TommyC> peaceblaster: If you don't know what parts of the kernel do what, it's best to leave it the way the generic kernel had it.
[04:31:12] <shonudo> no no, the CIA is the CIA
[04:31:15] <shonudo> no mistaking them

[04:31:34] <KaMii> sorry
[04:31:57] <peaceblaster> TommyC: k
[04:33:17] <Skywise> i would say configuring the kernel you should know what you're doing or leave it alone
[04:33:36] <KaMii> you have to learn somehow
[04:33:52] <KaMii> so just jump on in on a fresh install and play
[04:34:02] <peaceblaster> compiling
[04:34:08] <KaMii> and... done?
[04:34:17] <shonudo> that would be a record
[04:34:29] <n1x4> Been a record all day ;)

[04:36:34] <peaceblaster> I may just move this whole thing over to my wifi router and use ethernet for ssh
[04:36:35] <Skywise> i think he got that tutorial from boris baddinoff
[04:36:44] <peaceblaster> This shouldn't be this hard
[04:36:52] <shonudo> it isn't
[04:36:55] <n1x4> it isn't

[05:28:03] <peaceblaster> shonudo yes
[05:28:11] <KaMii> or he was compiling in /usr/src/linux
[05:28:24] <KaMii> and that was pointing somewhere else
[05:29:13] <DarthEaron> n1x4, the only time i used it was booting nortan gohst to flash the school's laptop hard drives, can you tell me a bit more please?
[05:29:38] <KaMii> ok i should probably try to sleep
[05:29:46] <KaMii> ive been up for idk 30 somthing hours
[05:29:54] <DarthEaron> wouldn't that require a server someone else

[05:36:17] <DarthEaron> i am exceptionally confused at this point.
[05:36:41] <n1x4> charbroiled chiclettes?
[05:36:56] <n1x4> ahh ok. makes sense now
[05:38:24] <DarthEaron> okay imma try usb again. pxe wont work for me.
[05:38:31] <n1x4> :(
[05:45:03] <n1x4> DarthEaron: How goes the floppy boot?
[05:45:39] <shonudo> what's a floppy?
[05:45:40] <shonudo> :P
[05:46:49] <DarthEaron> good so far, following alien pastures guide
[05:47:56] <n1x4> awesome
[05:53:44] <DarthEaron> thanks
[05:55:14] <DarthEaron> izarc did not show anything inside of usbboot.img so imma try winimage
[05:57:03] <DarthEaron> winimage works

[06:30:18] <XGizzmo> no
[06:30:40] <DarthEaron> why?
[06:31:30] <XGizzmo> it will try and copy tmpfs like /dev and kernel parts like /proc and /sys
[06:31:44] <DarthEaron> then how can i do this?
[06:34:11] <shonudo> you could make/use an image

[06:35:11] <DarthEaron> the root is 250gb right now , all i want is to boot from the 32gb an image would be too large
[06:37:07] <DarthEaron> the ssd is already formatted to ext4 and made bootable, all i need to do is put everything slack needs just to boot, change bootloader to mount hdd, install lilo...i think thats it
[06:38:15] <XGizzmo> you can use cp but you need to skip special directories like /dev /proc /sys though the static part of /dev needs to be copied.
[06:38:32] <d4wnr4z0r> cp -R $(ls / | grep -Ev 'proc|sys|dev') /mnt/blah

[06:40:18] <DarthEaron> cp: cannot stat 'var': No such file or directory
[06:40:37] <DarthEaron> it says the same thing with every folder within /
[06:40:45] <d4wnr4z0r> then cd /

[07:14:19] <slacktivist> what is trolling anyway... it's gotten to the point where you can't say anything tongue in cheek without being called a troll now
[07:14:19] <Skywise> s/by/but
[07:14:37] <shonudo> hmmm, not sure that's true, slacktivist
[07:14:48] <Skywise> trolling is saying inflammatory things in order to instigate an argument
[07:14:55] <shonudo> and hanging with it
[07:15:26] <Skywise> asking which to choose when you don't have to choose is just well, i don't even wanna say
[07:17:39] <shonudo> so, an advanced engineering degree or pancreatic cancer?
[07:17:55] <shonudo> ^^ it _could_ be amusing
[07:17:56] <slacktivist> i've made genuine queries on things and been called a troll.  i've voiced my opinion (in the appropriate fora) and been called a troll.  A lot of people experience it, and it just seems like a way to shut down or silence unpopular oopinions now
[07:18:24] <Skywise> well some people abuse the term, tell them they're trolling
[07:18:27] <shonudo> calling someone a troll can be a form of bullying, i agree
[07:18:35] <shonudo> that happens often enough
[07:21:41] <Skaperen> slacktivist: and sometimes it makes the speaker look like an idiot ... it's a way of life in IRC
[07:21:43] <Skywise> i think trolling has been expaned to cover being argumentative as well

[07:23:08] <Skywise> trolling was rampant on usenet, you'd see the same post in a dozen different groups
[07:23:19] <Skaperen> the most common is "you are wrong and I do not have to explain why" and usually means "I don't understand wtf you are saying so stfu"
[07:23:21] <Skywise> its just a cry for attention
[07:24:08] <shonudo> it is NOT!
[07:24:49] <Skaperen> I remember one forum some guy would always say I was wrong and never said enough to even know what HE was talking about ... he just liked to bully
[07:24:50] <cmyster> it is, but I don't feel like explaining :)
[07:25:10] <cmyster> morning btw
[07:25:25] <Skaperen> at first it got me to go into more detail about what I was saying ... no one really needed the more detail so I soon gave up
[07:25:32] <shonudo> morning cmyster
[07:26:09] <Skaperen> ironically, I very often did like to explain things in detail ... but most people understood (even if they didn't agree) before that

[07:29:52] <Skaperen> Slackware never had the problem
[07:30:08] <slacktivist> so why was it doing it?
[07:30:09] <Skaperen> and that was ultimately the clue
[07:30:14] <shonudo> wonder why it's setup that way
[07:30:24] <Skywise> one thing i've learned to speed up network connections is to specify norsh, even tho it always fails, its still tried
[07:30:49] <Skaperen> they all had "GSSAPIAuthentication yes" ... they enabled the GSSAPI thing
[07:30:59] <Skywise> doh
[07:31:16] <Skywise> authentication is really too complicated now
[07:31:24] <Skaperen> GSSAPI asks a number of security modules ... and waits for an answer ... even if none are configured
[07:31:47] <Skaperen> GSSAPI is a framework ... we have too many security frameworks, now
[07:31:50] <Skywise> yeah, its bizarre, theres almost no chance of setting it up right the first time
[07:32:05] <Skaperen> it doesn't actually do any checks for itself ... it just gets in the way
[07:32:17] <Skywise> sasl is also a pain in the ass
[07:32:25] <Skywise> well cyrus-sasl
[07:32:39] <Skywise> cause there are other implementations even if no one else uses them
[07:32:56] <Skaperen> and the way many distros are made, you have to become an expert in *ALL* of them to have any hope of getting things set up right without the shotgun solution of just disabling troublemakers
[07:33:16] <Skaperen> and indeed, cyrus-sasl is a troublemaker
[07:33:37] <Skaperen> SASL is a framework that should be called framenowork
[07:33:44] <Skywise> yeah, cyrus says only compile the modules you need without explaining what the differences are or why you'd choose one or the other
[07:34:06] <Skywise> yeah, when i do get it working i have no idea why its working
[07:34:09] <Skaperen> the greatest danger of security is the security software itself
[07:34:24] <Skywise> yeah, its really overly complex
[07:34:29] <Skaperen> the harder it is to configure, the less secure it is

[07:34:56] <Skaperen> if it depends on people knowing more, it will be less secure

[07:35:01] <shonudo> people will give up and bypass everything just to get things up and running

[07:36:12] marienz (~marienz@freenode/staff/marienz) joined ##slackware.
[07:37:06] <Skaperen> and people say that certain things are LESS secure without even looking at what it being referenced
[07:37:18] <Skywise> i have 3 different cyrus imap servers with 3 different configurations, even tho i compiled them all the same way, they just won't work with the same options
[07:37:28] <Skywise> i have no idea why, it drives me nuts
[07:37:38] <shonudo> same hardware?
[07:37:39] <d4wnr4z0r> and this is why I switched to dovecot years ago.
[07:37:59] <Skywise> no, but same version of software
[07:38:17] <shonudo> hmmm, doesn't make sense
[07:38:23] <Skywise> no it doesn't
[07:38:23] <shonudo> must have driven you nuts setting it up
[07:38:39] <Skywise> omg, something that should of taken less then an hour took over a week
[07:38:53] <Skaperen> I wrote a bash script to allow sending files between two remote computers that cannot SSH to each other (normally a good practice ... only let yourself ssh to them) ... without having to eat up your own bandwidth for the transfer (just go direct) ... it has encryption ... but it keeps it simple with one-time use shared keys (you share the key with yourself)
[07:39:22] <Skaperen> people who "know" that shared keys are "insecure" jumped all over it
[07:39:33] <Skywise> i had to log sql calls just to see it wasn't even using the right realm with trying to authenticate, it wasn't parsing the username, it was just using the local machine's hostname, i was like what?
[07:39:58] <Skaperen> you make up a random string and use it through each ssh session to the two hosts you have to do this ... where's the insecurity?

[07:40:32] <Skywise> d4wnr4z0r, yeah i gotta get around to trying out dovecot, i'm just still reading up on it
[07:41:20] <Skaperen> dovecot can be complex to set up, but it's not the worst
[07:41:37] Action: Skaperen is using it on his server
[07:42:01] <Skywise> with cyrus-imapd, the imapd.conf has options with and without the sasl_ prefix and theres no way to tell when its needed expect by trial and error
[07:42:30] <Skywise> i'd be using dovecot with sendmail i think
[07:44:32] Action: Skaperen is using it with postfix
[07:45:08] <Skywise> i suppose i could try a new mta too, but i'm used to sendmail and getting it tweaked how i need it
[07:45:16] <Skaperen> but I've been shying away from postfix because of versioning instability ... configs for older versions don't work on newer versions, and no guides or tools for conversion are made
[07:45:33] <Skaperen> use what you know how to use

[07:46:27] <d4wnr4z0r> amen to that
[07:46:39] <d4wnr4z0r> no mta is worth that.
[07:46:40] <Skaperen> what a poj m4 was
[07:47:08] <Skaperen> they should have used something decent like ... mmmm ... python
[07:47:33] <d4wnr4z0r> yeah, end result would have been the same, I'd still have not used it
[07:47:37] <Skywise> m4 isn't that big a deal
[07:47:57] <Skaperen> m4 fell into the set of languages I could never figure out
[07:47:58] <wood_quinn> Or heaven forbid plaintext config files!
[07:48:14] <d4wnr4z0r> wood_quinn: no good. too obvious.
[07:48:15] <Skywise> even tho it seems like its easier to edit the file, once you get used to it, its not hard to customize it
[07:48:25] <Skaperen> I'm not sure what the deal is with these few things, but for me they are simply unlearnable

[09:08:11] slacktivist (~teamedwar@69.23.62.118) joined ##slackware.

[09:09:13] <wood_quinn> The for loop should have had some if logic there.

[09:09:51] <Cultist> I'll work on a little script to work with it I guess

[17:06:28] <wood_quinn> Why would you not?
[17:06:46] <TommyC> I usually just read it off of my machine, and just use it on the other.

[17:08:09] <wood_quinn> Considering manuals are gzipped text files, you'd have to have a metric crap ton of them to actually warrant the removal on disc space grounds.
[17:08:11] <mad_enz> what about other ppl using the sever who might want to man something?
[17:08:14] <TommyC> eh, true but I just never felt like a production machine should have man pages for some reason (unless it was used by multiple sys admins)

[17:10:09] <wood_quinn> Which are only similar in the fact that they run Slack.
[17:10:15] <d4wnr4z0r> if they're all three the same version/arch/os and will be running the same software, I would every time.
[17:10:57] <d4wnr4z0r> this is, in fact, the reason sbotools supports a package storage directory for created packages.
[17:11:23] <Skywise> isn't that a fancy name for /tmp?
[17:11:25] <wood_quinn> If your production environment never changes, then you don't nead manuals or binutils.
[17:11:52] <wood_quinn> But that's a pipe dream.
[17:11:54] <d4wnr4z0r> Skywise: if you don't mind serving packages to your farm out of /tmp, then yes, it's the same.
[17:12:00] <Skywise> i don't see the economy of leaving it off

[17:20:32] <wood_quinn> You unplug a few servers, if it still works it's 100% effective.

[17:58:52] <mad_enz> both is a good idea
[17:58:56] <Skywise> but something like clonezilla would be good for bare iron backups, but usually if i'm restoring from bare iron, i'd upgrade instead of restore

[19:51:18] <foobarz> I'm still confused about character encodings with the default slackware install. The default uses kern param vt.default_utf8=0 and lang en_US... but this results in "invalid encoding" on characters outside the regular english alphabet?
[19:51:40] <Roin> yeah
[19:52:02] <Roin> you can easily change that in lilo conf and /etc/profile.d/lang.sh though
[19:52:09] <foobarz> here is some example text from the slackware changelog: Thanks to Thorsten Mhlfelder
[19:52:28] <Roin> heh ^^'
[19:52:47] <foobarz> the character is some questionmark thing of "invalid encoding":  Mhlfelder
[19:53:00] <Roin> Probably Mhlfelder
[19:54:03] <foobarz> so, the slackware changelog itself is corrupted with invalid encoded characters

[20:01:45] <TheM4ch1n3> pink_mist: I looked at android os v4 in qemu, was terrifically _stupid_
[20:01:48] <foobarz> oh wait... I did a full install for slackware64 in 2010
[20:01:58] <pink_mist> foobarz: it's after you setup lilo in the install process
[20:02:14] <core_saint> foobarz, nice... i am still at the point where once in a while i need to try out different distros for a few weeks just to find out that slackware is the one for me ;)
[20:02:15] <pink_mist> foobarz: and it does 'recommend' not to turn on utf8 console
[20:02:33] <pink_mist> foobarz: but still ... it's just on the console there's a problem ... under X it doesn't make a lick of difference
[20:02:53] <foobarz> pink_mist: what can happen bad on the console with utf8?
[20:02:59] <pink_mist> foobarz: no idea
[20:03:05] <pink_mist> it's worked fine for me
[20:03:14] <pink_mist> but there might be legacy stuff that borks
[20:03:23] <pink_mist> the installer better safe than sorry
[20:03:25] <pink_mist> +is
[20:04:59] <foobarz> pink_mist: okay... this utf8 choice I think can be confusing... that I found myself taking the default but later needing to change it to fix corrupted character encoding makes me wonder if full utf8 should be the default.. I will be quiet now and leave to whoever knows more about it tho :)
[20:05:44] <pink_mist> well the files themselves should be fine ....
[20:06:01] <foobarz> I wonder... do most other distro install with default fill utf8 settings ?
[20:06:04] <pink_mist> it should just be when you try to display them that things might bork .. and then only if you do it on console
[20:06:29] <pink_mist> most distros almost force you to use X ..
[20:06:39] <pink_mist> and as I said, there it doesn't even matter
[20:07:19] <foobarz> pink_mist: when a folder name (directory) has an invalid encoding in the name, many applications won't be able to read the entire folder
[20:08:02] <foobarz> pink_mist: and a file with invalid encoding in then name, many applications cannot open it, such as a music file cannot be loaded and played
[20:08:03] <pink_mist> ah, filenames is a different matter, yeah
[20:08:35] wbooze (~wbooze@xdsl-78-35-170-179.netcologne.de) joined ##slackware.
[20:08:48] <pink_mist> but that should still be mostly fine though, unless you're specifying the filename on the commandline and that borks
[20:08:50] <core_saint> i did install slack with utf as default and it worked just fine
[20:08:55] <pink_mist> yeah
[20:09:08] <pink_mist> been using utf8 since the option was available here
[20:09:11] <foobarz> pink_mist: so, when I switched to utf8 and edited the folder/filenames, then the applications can read it all okay
[20:09:11] <pink_mist> never had an issue
[20:09:32] <pink_mist> foobarz: yeah..
[20:15:49] <foobarz> core_saint: slackware is a good DIY kind of linux distro, you can run it reliably when I learn to manage and make the packages
[20:16:38] <foobarz> core_saint: if I were going to run a linux for dummies that did everything for me, maybe I'd run ubuntu, but not sure really

[20:19:56] <foobarz> core_saint: i get an uneasy feeling about the distros with complex package management systems that decide to upgrade everything automatically... but anyway a lot of people running a basic desktop linux can run those distros, but I think as soon as you want to customize something deep under the system, slackware lets do it better
[20:21:33] <core_saint> yep
[20:21:47] <Skaperen> foobarz: exactly
[20:22:03] <SignX> foobarz...what do you mean by 'customize something deep under the system'?
[20:22:03] <foobarz> core_saint: I run slackware64 100%.  When I play with other distros, I do it under slackware in KVM. Like, playing with ubuntu.

[20:23:04] <Skaperen> if you are happy with a distro as distributed, fine ... if you want to change something beyond just installing a new package in their repo (and this goes for installing anything from source that is already packaged, even a different version) then Slackware is the winner by not getting in your way
[20:23:27] <Skywise> and for the most part, you can add whatever functionality you want without alot of excess baggage
[20:23:37] <Skaperen> Slackware does not crush your hand
[20:23:57] <Skywise> slackware doesn't play hide a config
[20:24:04] <foobarz> SignX: well, installing a custom configured kernel yourself, upgrading major libraries like glibc... and editing init scripts, configuring and installing server software where I want to know exactly what the system is doing... under slackware you can be sure what is going to happen
[20:24:06] <Skaperen> you can even take things out with no more consequences than no having what you removed
[20:24:49] <SignX> foobarz: thnx
[20:25:30] <Skaperen> foobarz: VMs are a good tool for that ... but I find having a 2nd machine ... and running the VMs there, avoids banging my desktop resources

[20:27:00] <francog> bad... but xfce sounds good anyway
[20:27:06] <shadowsun> xfce rocks.
[20:27:08] <francog> i have an outdated hardware
[20:27:26] <shadowsun> xfce, windowmaker, blackbox/fluxbox, twm, fvwm95, etc.
[20:27:47] <francog> in the last period i was using fluxbox
[20:27:49] <Skaperen> gnome was going in some bad directions in ease of use, anyway
[20:28:01] <core_saint> i have about 260MB taken when start plain xfce with no apps running
[20:28:08] <core_saint> kde takes about 440 just to start
[20:28:15] <Skaperen> try out twm for that neckbeard experience :)
[20:28:33] <francog> great
[20:29:03] <francog> i miss slackware, i'm a fedora user now but i don't like the last changes (since a couple of releases)

[20:29:59] <Skaperen> where I need an RPM system, I do CentOS now
[20:30:22] <core_saint> for the other distros i tried i liked openSuse and debian
[20:30:39] <Skaperen> where I don't need an RPM system I do ... well ... you know
[20:30:51] <Skaperen> hint: not LFS
[20:30:55] <francog> hehe
[20:31:03] danonura (~zep@unaffiliated/danonura) joined ##slackware.
[20:31:21] <francog> i also tried debian
[20:31:25] <Skaperen> but I did actually use the end result of LFS on one project once
[20:31:35] <francog> :)
[20:32:01] <Skaperen> the issue I had with Debian is that stable was a bit behind ... more so than CentOS
[20:32:11] <core_saint> true
[20:32:14] <core_saint> same here
[20:32:15] <francog> right
[20:32:21] <Skaperen> I've not yet tried: Arch and Gentoo
[20:32:35] <francog> tried gentoo in 2005
[20:32:58] <core_saint> i find arch... hmm...
[20:33:28] <Skaperen> I tried SuSE long ago ... too messy, too complex, and it was slow
[20:33:29] <core_saint> i kind of did like arch but i felt like waiting for a system to break at any point upgrading
[20:34:09] <pink_mist> I've been tempted to try arch for a long while ... then a couple of months ago I found out they chose systemd
[20:34:09] <francog> anyone of you guys tried armedslack? i'm planning to play with it on raspberry pi
[20:34:15] <pink_mist> so now I am no longer tempted
[20:34:16] Action: Skaperen always installs new versions from scratch and migrate to the new one
[20:34:16] <core_saint> yes bigest complain with suse it is on a slow side... but it works just fine... i did try 12.2 on my laptop and i really like it
[20:34:41] <Skaperen> francog: I will if I ever get time to play with a raspi
[20:34:43] <pink_mist> haven't tried suse since version .... 6 I think
[20:35:07] Nick change: slowz -> sl0wz
[20:35:28] <Skaperen> I did Mandrake long long ago ... it was a bit easier to install than Redhat at the time, but no easier to use
[20:35:51] <Skaperen> and Ubuntu ... it won't even install on my machine
[20:36:19] <francog> the sad thing is that for people linux == ubuntu
[20:36:19] Action: Skaperen does know what the bug is
[20:36:21] <core_saint> if i had to use different distro i would probably go for suse or debian... maybe something based on gentoo.... not a big fan of compiling eveerything
[20:36:59] <core_saint> tried sabayon once...
[20:37:11] <core_saint> it worked fine on live cd
[20:37:14] Action: Skaperen did compile everything, many times, with the Timesys distro ... because he worked for Timesys at the time
[20:37:22] <core_saint> but once installed on hdd... had some video issues
[20:37:28] <core_saint> i could not solve

[20:39:26] <Skaperen> it was OK ... we had it all automated
[20:40:40] NitroGL (~NitroGL@gateway/tor-sasl/nitrogl) left irc: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[20:41:02] <SignX> What is the advantage of compiling everything? Is it only performance?
[20:41:43] <pink_mist> for 99% of software, it's not even performance.
[20:41:43] <NaCl> And control.
[20:41:53] <pink_mist> but control, yeah
[20:42:11] <Skaperen> we compiled everything just because ... but we also cached the results so we didn't have to recompile everything every time ... but once a distro was ready to release, we did a forced full compile and ran all the regression test suites one more time
[20:42:19] <NaCl> http://noobfarm.org/?id=634
[20:42:26] <core_saint> i don't think it is worth the time for a average user
[20:42:34] <Skaperen> depends on the user
[20:42:44] Action: Skaperen has recompiled slackware
[20:43:11] Action: Skaperen has compiled LFS probably 100 times
[20:43:16] Action: NaCl has compiled KDE a few times
[20:43:16] <core_saint> i usually compile slacks kernel with for my specific cpu and that is about it
[20:43:47] <core_saint> well and some additional software that is not included in distro
[20:44:10] <core_saint> compiling kde... crazy
[20:44:20] <NaCl> with build scripts
[20:44:25] <NaCl> everything is possible
[20:44:27] <core_saint> NaCl, why did you do that?
[20:45:10] <NaCl> because I could
[20:45:19] <core_saint> good enough... i guess
[20:45:20] <NaCl> and because the scripts were there
[20:45:43] <pink_mist> I once had to compile gtk2 ... after that experience I swore off anything gnome-related
[20:45:45] <SignX> Control...is a gray area. If you want real control...you have to write the code yourself :)
[20:46:08] <NaCl> design the hardware
[20:46:16] <NaCl> defy the laws of physics
[20:46:40] <SignX> You're right...lets not get into that.
[20:47:46] <pink_mist> there are always extremes ... see rms for example
[20:49:37] <SignX> I always wanted to know everything about the software I was using, I spend hours of fixing/changing small things...but lately I just want my software to work so I can concentrate on what I want to do. It's a different perspective...and I don't like it...
[20:50:18] <core_saint> is there a list oses that passed  trusted computer system evaluation
[20:50:25] <core_saint> of^
[20:51:05] <SignX> I get the idea that Slackware is actually good for people that want to know everything about the software they are using...and not for people that just want it to work.
[20:51:38] <core_saint> i would say both
[20:52:03] <core_saint> it happens to just work as well
[20:52:23] <SignX> That's true...but it requires a little more work. At least, for me.
[20:54:25] <core_saint> what did you have to do to make it work?

[20:59:21] <core_saint> well it does install it just doesnt work
[20:59:31] <core_saint> i get black screen
[20:59:44] <core_saint> probably some options i need to change... but not sure which ones
[21:00:09] <SignX> I have this Optimus technology from nvidia...but apparently it chose randomly which one to use at startup.

[21:01:07] <SignX> In Slackware 14 it works out of the box. It was probably kernel-related.
[21:01:39] <core_saint> mine worked just fine in 13.37
[21:02:06] timahvo1 (~rogue@41.212.120.45) joined ##slackware.
[21:02:20] <SignX> mmm...well...I ended up disabling my Nvidia driver...so it always chose the Intel one...
[21:02:25] <core_saint> i think i might need to compile kernel without ati support at all
[21:02:37] <core_saint> and try it again

[22:29:19] <hpg> slacktivist, yes, IMO are 412 new lines in a kernel config file quite a lot if you want to take the old config as a base for a new custom kernel ...

[22:35:24] <Urchlay> there you will find Pat's .config files for 3.7.1, which would make a better starting point for you than trying to use a 2.6 config
[22:36:11] <hpg> Urchlay, well, it's not for me :)
[22:36:36] <hpg> Urchlay, but thanks anyway! :)
[22:36:45] <core_saint> it looks like the whole situation has changes.... amd released new drivers
[22:37:02] <core_saint> and there are some errors making package
[22:37:19] <core_saint> need to figure out that first
[22:38:11] <Urchlay> hpg: what are you actually doing? you've got a slackware box with a 2.6 kernel, and you want to have a 3.7 kernel instead?
[22:39:14] <core_saint> this is funny amd website says driver version is 12.6 but download is 13.1
[22:42:31] <hpg> Urchlay, no, I only gave some hints to core_saint - I'm running 14.0 here with a custom 3.2.29 kernel ...
[22:43:07] <Urchlay> ok
[22:43:14] <Urchlay> so what are you trying to do?
[22:44:15] <core_saint> back on 13.37 i have had ati proprietary driver installed with no problems
[22:44:30] <core_saint> but on 14 i keep getting issues...
[22:44:48] <hpg> Urchlay, I tried to help core_saint - and I'm still customizing my own system ... :)
[22:44:50] <core_saint> i wanted to see what has changed in config
[22:45:47] <core_saint> but now it looks like ati has released new drivers... and those are giving some errors when trying to make package

[22:57:24] <Urchlay> I had exactly that happen last night. The way I fixed it (which is probably the wrong way to do it) was to:
[22:57:27] <sencha> http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/
[22:57:30] <sencha> take the nofap challenge
[22:57:52] <Urchlay> cd /path/to/linux-source ; zcat /proc/config.gz > .config ; make prepare ; make modules
[22:58:12] <core_saint> sounds like a solution
[22:58:14] <Urchlay> ...and pressed ^C after it finished compiling the stuff in scripts/
[22:58:43] <core_saint> i shouldn't have been doing make mrproper
[22:58:48] <sencha> ... wrong room
[22:58:48] <sencha> lol
[22:59:29] <Urchlay> I had thought "make prepare" would compile the stuff in scripts/, including recordmcount and modpost
[22:59:32] <Urchlay> but it doesn't
[22:59:47] <slacktivist> meta:(it's good to know you aren't typing with one hand right now at least sencha)
[23:00:04] <core_saint> yep i did "make prepare" as well ;)
[23:00:48] <Urchlay> sencha: is that like the Web 2.0 version of the Seinfeld episode about being the master of your domain?

[23:07:10] <slacktivist> the setup: i could never go that long without sex.  how do monks and nuns do it?
[23:07:28] <Skywise> what makes you think they do
[23:07:50] <pi31415> not everyone is wired the same way
[23:07:54] <Skywise> the piety is just a front
[23:07:56] <Urchlay> possibly they're people with a naturally low sex drive. Also, if you can't stand it, you can quit being a monk any time you want (just leave the monastery)

[23:10:27] <core_saint> thx Urchlay it did the trick
[23:10:27] <hpg> bash-completion is not working on my system - does it need any configuration before that?
[23:11:00] <Urchlay> core_saint: there's likely a correct way to do that, at some point I'll run 'make help' and sift through what it tells me
[23:11:06] <Skywise> well the start of the line are commands and then after a space it does files
[23:11:17] <Skywise> what happens when you press tab?
[23:11:46] <Urchlay> you're talking about the bash-completion package from extra/, or just the built in completion it already does?
[23:12:06] <Skywise> oh, prolly that package
[23:12:27] <Skywise> i don't use it
[23:12:47] <hpg> Urchlay, yes, the separate package
[23:13:06] <Urchlay> yeah, I haven't used that in ages
[23:13:36] <Skywise> you prolly need to log back in after installing it

[23:15:58] <Skywise> it doesn't need time to cure
[23:16:08] <hpg> lol
[23:16:14] <Skywise> but you do need to refresh your environment
