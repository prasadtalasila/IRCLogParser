[01:53:54] <KaMii> submerge your computer in wd40 and see what happens
[01:54:48] <shonudo> buy enough wd40 to submerge a box and i can tell you one think that will have already happened: you'll be broke
[01:56:20] <KaMii> this is why i usually avoid forums, they are full of trolls and morons that just talk as though they know what they are talking about, when in reality they dont even know their asshole from their elbow
[01:57:25] <shonudo> all kidding aside, wd40 is great on fishing lures

[02:09:07] <shonudo> just a guess
[02:09:31] <alisonken1home> hair spray makes better flame throwers than wd-40
[02:10:00] <alisonken1home> some of the prison movies I've seen actually get that one right

[02:12:10] <shonudo> what does the prisoner do with the hair spray/flamethrower to keep himself/herself out?

[02:12:56] <alisonken1home> mess your day right up if it's sprayed into your face

[03:02:59] <peaceblaster> Also, total n00b question, but I'm trying to set it up so that only some users can sudo, which I'm painfully aware shouldn't be a hard process, yet all I find on the web are Ubuntu guides on opening sudo to all without password, which makes my skin crawl. Unfortunately the man page hasn't been too helpful either... how do I set this up properly?

[03:16:09] <Fay> just my 2c
[03:16:50] <ananke> what 'power' or 'versatility'?
[03:17:00] <ryerke> Pretty much what I meant by power is that the user has control of dep resolution instead of relinquishing it
[03:17:46] <Fay> i thinks just simplicity
[03:17:47] <ananke> ryerke: that's silly. you can force whatever you want with regards to dependencies
[03:18:19] <ryerke> nvrmind
[03:18:30] <Fay> hehe
[03:19:09] <ryerke> ananke: explain
[03:19:51] <ananke> ryerke: you're claiming that 'user has control of dep resolution'. that's silly. slackpkg doesn't give you any additional control that those other tools don't give you
[03:20:06] <Fay> explain what? how to grab and build deps? put it in the slackbuild
[03:20:28] <ananke> you can break/force whatever you'd like with rpm/dpkg/etc when it comes to package installation/removal
[03:21:28] <ananke> so much for 'power' option. now, on the flip side, those other tools provide you with the ability to follow dependencies. unlike slackpkg
[03:21:39] <ryerke> I suppose but it seems a lot more confusing to do it in rpm than is slackpkg
[03:22:20] <ananke> ryerke: --nodeps is 'more confusing'?
[03:22:45] <Fay> this ^ is really funny
[03:23:07] <ryerke> Personally, I feel slackpkg is easier than rpm. That's all I meant to say. I wasn't looking for an argument
[03:23:45] <ananke> that's another story. whatever you may find easier is certainly subjective

[03:24:33] <ryerke> But if you want to contend that slackpkg sucks and urpmi rocks, that's your business
[03:24:42] <ananke> when it comes to the typical definitions of 'power' and 'versatility' in the software world, they're equated to the amount of features and functionality. slackpkg by comparison is fairly primitive
[03:24:54] <Fay> KaMii: Hey
[03:24:54] <ryerke> Only in *certain* channels
[03:24:59] <ananke> 'sucks/rocks' are nothing but subjective opinions
[03:25:10] <Fay> slackware is one of those channels on certain nights
[03:25:13] <KaMii> hai
[03:25:24] <ryerke> That's what I can derive from your statements
[03:25:33] <ananke> ryerke: you shouldn't, because that's silly

[04:57:14] <Demon_Fox> Anyone else notice that if the volume is not loud enough on speakers, they can't pick up the audio at all?
[04:58:06] <shonudo> you need to "drive" speakers
[04:58:13] <Demon_Fox> ?
[04:58:28] <shonudo> power per speaker + a certain level of volume
[04:58:36] <shonudo> otherwise they don't do much
[04:59:17] <Demon_Fox> ah
[04:59:20] <Demon_Fox> thanks
[05:00:06] <shonudo> yw although i just read what i posted and it's a flaky explanation
[05:00:13] <shonudo> right idea, not the best way to put it
[05:00:24] <Demon_Fox> Here is what I got out of it:
[05:00:54] <Demon_Fox> Sensitivity of the speaker, operation power
[05:01:19] <Demon_Fox> and volume affect it
[05:01:25] <shonudo> yeah; if you have a speaker that requires 75w of power and your amp is delivering it 25w, you have a problem
[05:01:46] <shonudo> you can't drive that speaker (based on its design) with 25w
[05:01:49] <shonudo> nothing moves
[05:01:53] <shonudo> no motion, no sound
[05:01:59] <Demon_Fox> I had a box around here somewhere that said its sensitivity
[05:02:32] <shonudo> box?
[05:02:50] <Demon_Fox> I usually keep the box until the warranty expires
[05:02:55] <shonudo> ah
[05:03:02] <shonudo> _that_ box
[05:03:04] <Demon_Fox> and it lists this kind of information I previously dismissed.
[05:03:26] Action: Demon_Fox is sorry for the confusion
[05:03:35] <Urchlay> eh, even worse than that: if your 75w speaker isn't sensitive enough to be audible with the 25w amp, you'll crank up the amp... and the amp will probably clip (on a scope it looks like square waves) and fry the speaker
[05:03:48] <shonudo> yup
[05:03:53] <Demon_Fox> I came up to a solution for my audio problem
[05:04:03] <Demon_Fox> ear plugs to dampen the noise
[05:04:06] <shonudo> underpowering a speaker is actually worse than an amp that is "too powerful"
[05:04:09] <Demon_Fox> then head phones over it
[05:04:11] <shonudo> (within limits)
[05:04:20] <Demon_Fox> and turning up the volume
[05:04:42] <shonudo> that's not a solution
[05:04:46] <Urchlay> but, 25w should be enough to move pretty much any speaker cone some. If you hear nothing at all, more likely the wiring's bad or maybe you've got an open voice coil (=fried always)
[05:04:47] <Demon_Fox> sorry
[05:04:50] <shonudo> that sounds (pun intended) horrible
[05:04:51] <Demon_Fox> I mean
[05:04:53] <Urchlay> s/always/already/
[05:05:09] <Demon_Fox> patchy fix
[05:05:24] <Demon_Fox> Maybe those ear bud ones are better at this.
[05:05:36] <Urchlay> ear buds hurt my ears
[05:05:36] <shonudo> ear buds don't take jack to drive
[05:05:51] <Demon_Fox> that is why I thought of them
[05:05:52] <Urchlay> even with no sound going to them, just having them in my ears hurts after a couple minutes
[05:06:03] <shonudo> ear buds wear me out; fatigue
[05:06:11] <shonudo> the sound wears me out
[05:06:17] <Demon_Fox> more sensitivity at a much quieter volume
[05:06:19] <shonudo> there's no "space"
[05:06:31] <Urchlay> yeah, that happens to me too, even with regular headphones
[05:06:37] <Demon_Fox> ah
[05:06:56] <Demon_Fox> My favorite are the ones that go fully over my ears and tune out side noise
[05:07:05] <Demon_Fox> oops
[05:07:13] <Demon_Fox> badly worded sentence
[05:07:22] <Urchlay> studio cans are better... but still not as good as a set of good speakers, at a reasonable volume & distance from the ear

[05:12:55] <Skywise> i dunno, at some point its more about ego then performance
[05:13:04] <Urchlay> weirdest broken speakers I ever saw... some 3-way tower speakers that had a passive reflector, the guy had replaced the reflector with another 12" woofer
[05:13:11] Oak (~Oak@unaffiliated/alreadygone) left irc: Ping timeout: 276 seconds
[05:13:34] <Skywise> he doesn't understand speakers
[05:13:36] <Urchlay> so the extra bass vibrated the cabinet apart (glue joints, the fix was to use stronger glue)
[05:13:43] <Skywise> my main speakers are like that
[05:14:01] <Urchlay> a week later, a guy showed up with an identical looking pair of speakers, complaining that there was no bass
[05:14:10] <KaMii> i would be moar impressed if the people that post about their hardware on forum signatures, actually build that hardware from boards, instead of bought it in a store...
[05:14:30] <Urchlay> ...he had bought them from the first guy. And yep, each speaker had a passive reflector in place of the woofer
[05:14:45] <KaMii> i just love how they talk about how many monitors and digital cameras they have... like anyone cares
[05:15:25] <Skywise> the guy is a genious
[05:15:44] <KaMii> theres a fine line between genious and insanity
[05:16:03] <Urchlay> the first guy owned a pawn shop
[05:16:48] <Urchlay> or in the words of Nigel Tufnel... There's a fine line between clever and stupid.

[05:17:37] <Demon_Fox> I would really like speakers that would only get to so many DBs before they stopped getting louder
[05:17:49] <Demon_Fox> That could tolerate it.
[05:17:51] <Skywise> ?
[05:17:57] <shonudo> i don't get that
[05:18:00] <shonudo> what do you mean?
[05:18:05] <Demon_Fox> I don't like loud noises
[05:18:13] <Demon_Fox> or sudden loud noises
[05:18:27] <Skywise> if you want your speakers to muffle the sound then get bose
[05:18:29] <shonudo> that leaves surround-sound movies out
[05:18:36] <shonudo> it's like being at a theme park
[05:18:37] <pi31415> ugh, smartphone carrier fees are obscene
[05:18:52] <shonudo> exploding cars in movies are louder than exploding cars
[05:19:04] <Skywise> yeah, a smart phone is a death by 1000 cuts
[05:19:04] <Demon_Fox> I mean
[05:19:27] <Urchlay> use an old carver power amp. They skimped on the buffer caps, the amp is incapable of suddenly jumping more than 20dB or so, IIRC
[05:19:27] <Demon_Fox> I want it to get to a certain point in how loud the film is, and not get any louder
[05:19:33] <Skywise> they'll get thousands from you $1 at a time
[05:19:44] <pi31415> i was looking at the disclaimer for a landline from the 1 and only provider in this area, and all of the plans say "excluding ..., dial-up internet, ..."
[05:19:47] <Urchlay> Demon_Fox: get a limiter
[05:20:01] <shonudo> Demon_Fox: it's also the way the movie is mixed
[05:20:02] <Demon_Fox> Thanks, I could not think of what it was called
[05:20:10] <Skywise> has anyone noticed a difference in commerical volume?
[05:20:11] <pi31415> made me wonder whether they actively blocked dial-up connections somehow
[05:20:17] <Skywise> i don't think they've turned it down
[05:20:18] <shonudo> some amps have a way of leveling that out
[05:20:36] <Demon_Fox> Urchlay, How much are these limiters for head phones?
[05:20:38] <shonudo> depends on the amp; on some it's called "night mode"
[05:20:43] <shonudo> others have other names for it
[05:20:48] <shonudo> just levels the sound out
[05:21:05] <Urchlay> dunno. The only ones I have experience with are guitar pedals or rackmount PA equipment
[05:21:05] <Skywise> normalization
[05:21:09] <Urchlay> I have one of these: http://www.zzounds.com/item--ALENANOCOMP
[05:21:44] <pi31415> Skywise: one option is to cancel TV service
[05:21:45] <Skywise> i could go for a candy bar or maybe some trail mix
[05:21:59] <Skywise> pi31415, yeah that has some limitations
[05:21:59] <pi31415> Skywise: or use Netflix, which doesn't have commercials
[05:22:01] <Urchlay> used it for bass guitar, until I bought an amp head with a built-in compressor that sounds just as good (and one less piece of gear to carry, one less cord to get tangled...)
[05:22:10] <Skywise> i don't watch movies
[05:22:41] <Skywise> i like educational tv and live sports
[05:22:51] <Skywise> racing and football
[05:23:00] <KaMii> and curling
[05:23:24] <Skywise> curling is how i drinks me beers
[05:23:25] <shonudo> how did that become a sport?
[05:23:30] <pi31415> curling is strange
[05:23:31] <Skywise> its a pastime
[05:23:44] <pi31415> "Apparently you're not a golfer"
[05:23:47] <Skywise> sports involve physical activity
[05:23:54] <Skywise> golf is a pastime as well

[05:25:30] <Demon_Fox> Urchlay, I suppose I am looking for speakers with high sensitivity and limiters. Am I correct based on what I am wanting?
[05:25:48] <shonudo> the ice seems to be doing most of the work in curling
[05:25:50] <KaMii> you want too much
[05:25:51] <KaMii> lol
[05:26:19] <KaMii> im sure those people with the brooms can get a nasty injury in curling
[05:26:34] <Skywise> sliding stones around on ice is something you only do out of the greatest of boredom
[05:26:40] <Urchlay> yeah. I dunno if there's such a thing as a speaker with a built-in limiter (I suspect not), it's a piece of outboard gear, generally they operate on line-level (not amplified) signals
[05:26:44] <shonudo> and the greatest of ice
[05:26:45] <pi31415> which they have plenty of in Scotland
[05:26:47] <shonudo> too much winter
[05:26:58] <KaMii> i got curling elbow, so now i need disability
[05:27:12] <Urchlay> more likely you'd find a receiver or amp with a built-in limiter (like shonudo said, it might be called something else)
[05:27:59] <pi31415> they should combine curling with go
[05:28:09] <pi31415> it would take choreography
[05:28:17] <shonudo> i think curling qualifies you for disability even if you don't hurt your elbow
[05:29:17] <Skywise> yeah, mental
[05:29:17] <fuzzix> I have a bad case of curling hair, definitely should get some handouts for that
[05:29:36] <Skywise> just put down the wand

[09:37:47] <KaMii> (im afraid to know the answer)
[09:37:51] <Cultist> The buying type.
[09:38:02] <Cultist> Thought I'd ask here because everyone in my other channels is asleep
[09:38:05] <wood_quinn> Making a squirrel army wasn't the best choice in the world.
[09:38:28] <KaMii> what kind of experince do you need to buy a stuffed animal?
[09:38:58] <Cultist> Mostly just trying to get an idea of how big a stuffed animal should be
[09:39:03] <Cultist> the normal sized kind
[09:39:05] <wood_quinn> Six.
[09:39:13] <Cultist> they seem to range in size from 8 inches to around 16 inches
[09:39:14] <KaMii> just grab it, walk up to the cashier and say, hello my good sir, i would like to purchase this my little pony stuffed animal.. and yes i have a daughter, or that would make me kinda freaky
[09:39:28] <Cultist> well they're online I mean
[09:39:41] <KaMii> they range in all sizes
[09:39:46] <KaMii> some very small, some life sized
[09:40:04] <wood_quinn> Cultist: Only in pornos.
[09:40:05] <KaMii> some have nice soft stuffing, others... feel like its cardboard
[09:40:10] <wood_quinn> In reality they're much more varied in size.
[09:40:22] <Cultist> Maybe I should wait til I'm near a build a bear or something

[16:03:28] <BrokenCog> days seem to be reasonably good enough.  probably could look at adduser script  - it's probably using a full time stamp, just not prompting for the hours/mins.
[16:03:43] <wood_quinn> Make "at foo bar" in your temp user's .bash_profile
[16:03:51] <wood_quinn> Make it set the password to something random.

[18:23:42] <hpg> how I have to prepare (partition/format) an USB stick in order to create a Slackware boot stick from that device?
[18:23:51] <hpg> hi pnpuff
[18:24:46] <wood_quinn> You don't need to prepare it.
[18:24:55] <wood_quinn> dd will take care of it, or usbimg2disk.sh will.
[18:25:31] nawcom (~nawcom@97-71-116-125.res.bhn.net) joined ##slackware.
[18:25:32] <wood_quinn> If you want to do it manually, you just need a FAT32 partition.
[18:25:46] <wood_quinn> Then install syslinux and copy the tree over.

[18:26:52] <hpg> well, during installation of Slackware 14 I tried to create such a boot stick, but it failed to boot (but I found some files on it though ...)
[18:27:21] <wood_quinn> Oh I don't know what that boot disk uses.
[18:27:37] <Demon_Fox> Urchlay, I figured out why it would not produce sound at the volume I had it
[18:27:44] <wood_quinn> Your installer functions as a boot disk though.
[18:28:00] <Demon_Fox> It for some reason only produce sound at around 10DB according to the box
[18:28:01] <d4wnr4z0r> isn't the boot disk part of the installer specific to floppies?
[18:28:13] <wood_quinn> d4wnr4z0r: No, the concept is though.
[18:28:26] <d4wnr4z0r> um
[18:28:34] <wood_quinn> Really there's no reason to make a boot disc in this day and age.
[18:28:49] <wood_quinn> Recovery distros are a dime a dozen, and do more than give you a basic shell.

[19:08:05] omyasuda (~omy@200.160.74.27) joined ##slackware.
[19:08:13] <hiptobecubic> but unless some magic happened, you need to do a tiny little amount of work to have it auto detect the rootfs on arbitrary systems
[19:08:16] <hiptobecubic> right
[19:08:33] <hiptobecubic> That was my only problem as well. But it wasn't terribly hard, like i said. Just use UUID=... instead
[19:08:44] <nofra> If you want a universal stick, you have to use an initrd to start the system and get udev running
[19:08:50] <hiptobecubic> and make sure you specify a short sleep period when you make initrd
[19:09:00] <nofra> and you have to set up dev to assing drives based on uuid

[19:39:40] Action: nofra shakes his fists at Xenserver
[19:40:12] <Sandman1> I haven ever played with Xenserver, I would like to check it out when I ahve some time:D
[19:40:25] <nofra> Sandman1: It is SOOOOOOOOO Easy
[19:40:34] <pi31415> I switched from KVM to VirtualBox at home 2 years ago when FreeBSD crashed due to KVM bugs
[19:40:35] <nofra> But Slack14 won't boot on it
[19:40:58] <eviljames> I think vbox is better for 'casual' VM work, but if you're going to be running more than 1-2 instances at a time, use something less desktop-y
[19:41:05] <pi31415> VirtualBox isn't as fast as Xen, but it has a lot going for it
[19:41:05] <nofra> pi31415: That's what I'm running now... vbox
[19:41:39] Action: eviljames needs to make zvol iscsi exports to back KVM :D
[19:41:40] <pi31415> eviljames: virtualbox has headless auto startup, command line options to do everything, and a python API to automate all the things
[19:41:55] <nofra> Sandman1: CORRECTION: Slack14 won't boot on Xenserver 6.0
[19:42:01] <nofra> Don't know about 6.1
[19:42:26] <eviljames> pi31415: Indeed, but it has always felt 'clunky' to me.  the vbox headless stuff and networking particularly gets dodgy
[19:42:54] <eviljames> Do KVM guests glom up as much ram as they can (like vbox does)?
[19:42:56] <pi31415> that is true, the networking takes some care
[19:43:16] <pi31415> yes, kvm does that
[19:43:45] <nofra> vbox networking?  Really? After I figured out the Clone eth0 problem, getting the NIC working was a breeze (compared to KVM)'

[19:44:17] <pi31415> if you are on WIFI only, like me at home, then KVM DOES NOT LIKE
[19:44:22] <eviljames> aw, damn.  I wonder if there's a solution to that particular problem.  Suppose you want to run X virtual instances, with Y RAM each, you need X*Y RAM in the machine.
[19:44:35] <nofra> KMV networking is evil

[21:18:28] <smed> the issue I have is that after 100,000-150,000 miles, you need to replace the batteries in a hybrid....
[21:18:36] <smed> so lets just say that # is 150,000
[21:18:46] foobarz (1000@unaffiliated/foobarz) left irc: Ping timeout: 248 seconds
[21:18:55] <smed> and the replacement batteries are going to cost you $5-8000
[21:19:14] <smed> who is dumb enough to dump $5-8000 into a car with 150,000 miles?
[21:19:28] <smed> you have new batteries....but the rest of the car is beaten....
[21:19:51] <BrokenCog> smed: i think that issue is a legacy one, and they aren't that, and other parts trans/etc often fail after that much miles and they cost about the same as batteries.
[21:20:41] <smed> well I recall seeing a chart of estimated replacement battery costs and they all exceeded $5000
[21:20:51] <BrokenCog> first non ad result: http://www.autoweek.com/car-shopping/articles/2012/11/replacing-a-hybrids-battery-may-not-cost-as-much-as-you-think.html
[21:21:04] <BrokenCog> ten years ago, probabrly.
[21:21:35] <BrokenCog> ...  to spend $1,800 on a battery after 150,000 miles
[21:21:58] <smed> not 10
[21:22:05] <smed> but your right, those do seem like more reasonable prices.

[21:23:27] <BrokenCog> hybrids are great in urban stop and go - only marginally better mileage on the freeway than a decent modern coupe.
[21:24:32] <BrokenCog> i thought about buying one .. borrowed a friends for a couple weeks.  i could do all the tricks in the city and get over 60 mpg but on the freeway it was always about 48.  not shabby, but something to buy a 30k car for.
[21:24:44] <smed> well yeah...city drivers are the target audience

[21:36:09] <BrokenCog> that's the ethanol I think.  not sure.

[23:38:15] <hpg> wood_quinn, you mean the guy who lost his silicon?
[23:38:40] <peaceblaster> Is it possible to run Gnome on Slackware 14?
[23:39:01] <eviljames> Definitely, maybe.
[23:39:03] <hpg> peaceblaster, yes, of course
[23:39:38] <hpg> peaceblaster, but it's not so easy to install it ...
[23:40:04] <peaceblaster> Could one of you point me at an article and/or site on how to do that? the only one I found was for 13 and it's net installer gave me 404s =p
[23:40:16] <hpg> peaceblaster, I warn you - it's apita!

[23:40:58] <peaceblaster> ok, not quite sure what that is =p

[23:43:47] <wood_quinn> Unless it's been updated for 14.0, it likely won't.
[23:44:06] <wood_quinn> And #gsb is the correct place to ask for help if it doesn't.
[23:44:17] <kaleun> Yeah! Not in here!
[23:45:08] <DrCurl> hi, I want to setup a minimal kde desktop, there are so many kde packages in 14, can someone let me know what I need to get a functionnal kde desktops without installing everything?
[23:45:26] <hpg> peaceblaster, Gnome is a MONSTER!
[23:45:48] <pi31415> didn't the gnome head honcho switch to Apple?
[23:45:51] <hpg> peaceblaster, it will eat you for lunch
[23:46:03] <kaleun> I don't think any of the KDE stuff is optional. It's just broken up into packages for some unknown-to-me reason.
[23:46:37] <wood_quinn> I only have kdelibs installed and nothing else.
[23:46:47] <eviljames> no, KDE/ and XFCE/ sets are completely optional.
[23:47:01] <hpg> kaleun, a lot of KDE packages are optional
[23:47:08] <kaleun> Oh okay.
[23:47:08] <wood_quinn> DrCurl: If you want something minimal, you don't want KDE period.
[23:47:22] <hpg> kaleun, even if you use KDE
[23:47:25] <DrCurl> basically, I want the kde desktop, dolphin and plasma widgets
[23:47:50] <KaMii> going for a minimal setup huh?  you should put some okular in that
[23:48:04] <hpg> kaleun, but you can't compare KDE with Gnome
[23:48:40] <kaleun> Did I compare them? I didn't mean to.
[23:49:13] <wood_quinn> DrCurl: In other words, you want magic.
[23:49:24] <wood_quinn> All the bells and whistles with none of the noise.
[23:49:29] <hpg> kaleun, ok :)
[23:49:41] <Skywise> silent bells and whistles, eh?
[23:50:00] <DrCurl> xfce does not handle multiple display correctly and performs badly with samba drives... wanna give kde a shot
[23:50:19] <DrCurl> why would it be magic, those parts are mixted with other stuff in the packages?
[23:50:44] <kaleun> It's magic. And we don't have to explain it!

[23:51:58] <wood_quinn> XFCE handles multiple displays fine, and any problems with SMB drives are unrelated to KDE vs. XFCE.
[23:55:01] <DrCurl> in 14, xfce does not support extending desktop, and smb problems come from gfvs from what I know...
[23:55:19] <peaceblaster> Could at the very least install an older KDE?
[23:55:40] <peaceblaster> KDE 4 isn't good for my blood pressure
[23:55:52] <eviljames> KDE > *
[23:56:34] <wood_quinn> emacs > KDE
[23:56:52] <wood_quinn> That's right, enjoy your paradox.
[23:56:53] <kaleun> You guys have awful taste in software.
[23:57:25] <wood_quinn> emacs' > simply trancends logic
