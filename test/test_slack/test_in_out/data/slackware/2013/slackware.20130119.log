[00:17:39] <hpg> Urchlay, 42294
[00:18:37] <Urchlay> ok, I appear to be missing 2 bytes then
[00:18:53] <Urchlay> starts with: 4sICN7J+
[00:19:19] <Urchlay> ends with an =, which I think is correct for base64
[00:19:48] <hpg> Urchlay, yes, it should start with H4sICN7J+
[00:20:08] <Urchlay> yah, the first line was 1 char shorter than the rest
[00:20:20] <Urchlay> the other missing byte is probably the \n at the end of the file
[00:20:20] <hpg> Urchlay, but where is the second byte - very strange ...
[00:21:17] <Urchlay> dpaste converts all \n into \r\n, and removes the \n from the last line of the file. I had already stripped the \r's

[00:38:20] <_LuseR_> there was a good package in slaky.eu
[00:38:37] <KaMii> yea...i wouldnt trust precompiled binaries
[00:39:05] <Urchlay> KaMii: skype is closed-source, it's always a precompiled binary
[00:39:28] <KaMii> i stand by my statement of dis-trust
[00:39:34] <Urchlay> his only choice if he didn't trust it, would be to not install it (am assuming he needs it for something though)

[00:42:03] <Urchlay> right, you haven't changed anything about it, so it doesn't work... see if the SBo one does work. If not, we can assume it's skype itself that's the problem, and not the particular package of it you're using
[00:42:10] <KaMii> please pat, rename -current to -beta.deveopers.only.this.is.unstable.and.will.break.your.system.all.your.base.are.belong.to.me

[00:43:18] <Urchlay> KaMii: if nobody but the 3 or 4 core developers ever ran -current, that'd be a bad thing. The whole point of -current is for users (hopefully advanced ones) to use it, to help spot bugs
[00:43:56] <KaMii> Urchlay: but thats the problem, we get too many new useres grabbing it because they think -current means the latest stable
[00:44:12] <Urchlay> yeah, maybe he should call it -unstable

[00:44:28] <Urchlay> *new* users shouldn't be messing with -current, I agree
[00:44:51] <KaMii> even calling it beta you get new users grabbing it.  I see that on microsoft forums all the time, some guy grabs a beta of some program, it doesnt work, then he flames the forum...

[00:45:37] <KaMii> the only reason I want to fork slackware is so I can rename -current to -developers-only
[00:45:55] <Urchlay> that won't really stop anyone from using it
[00:46:09] <KaMii> i know, but i think it will cut down on the cornfustion
[00:46:14] <Skywise> i'm with you there
[00:46:23] <Urchlay> plus, nobody's gonna use KaMii's fork of slackware except maybe KaMii

[00:46:33] <KaMii> when I first got into slackware, i installed -current because I thought that was the latest stable... i was wrong
[00:46:45] <KaMii> Urchlay: the whole world will use it
[00:46:52] <Urchlay> yeah, because you didn't read the README I bet
[00:47:01] <KaMii> it will be bigger than ubuntu, bigger than unity
[00:47:19] <KaMii> Urchlay: n00bs dont read readme's
[00:47:20] <KaMii> and i was one
[00:47:28] <Skywise> anyone run imap servers for more then 1 domain? i'm looking for a replacement for cyrus-imapd
[00:47:55] <Urchlay> actually, the readme.txt for -current doesn't mention that it's -current, it says "welcome to slackware 14.0"...
[00:48:07] <KaMii> lol
[00:48:07] <Urchlay> so if you had read it, it wouldn't have enlightened you
[00:48:14] <KaMii> another thing to add to the fork
[00:48:15] <KaMii> haha
[00:48:41] <Skywise> i like it cause you can add email users without shell accounts or system accounts, i don't like it because its configuationn is poorly documented and fragile

[00:49:55] <_LuseR_> my bad english + my user conffusion = this is a hell xd
[00:49:55] <hpg> Urchlay, do you also have a link for the recent version of skype (4.1)?
[00:50:00] <KaMii> _LuseR_: well i dont think pat is fluent in other languages
[00:50:02] <Urchlay> _LuseR_: pat probably doesn't speak multiple languages... I bet if you translated his docs into some other language, he'd include them in slackware some day
[00:50:22] <KaMii> google translate works... sorta
[00:50:25] <Skywise> lol
[00:50:42] <Urchlay> hpg: I don't. I told you, I know nothing of skype (I've never even watched over someone's shoulder as they used it), I'm just applying standard troubleshooting to your problem
[00:50:46] <Skywise> i'm sure google translate has already gotten someone shot somewhere
[00:50:57] <Urchlay> "My hovercraft is full of eels!"
[00:51:06] <hpg> Urchlay, ok :)
[00:51:09] <Skywise> that could do it
[00:51:13] <KaMii> i thought skype only worked on 32 bit, so you  need multilib if you are 64
[00:51:52] <Urchlay> KaMii: so I've heard also. But then the slackbuild has an option to build a "static" skype, maybe that wouldn't need multilib?
[00:52:00] <Urchlay> beside, he *is* using multilib
[00:52:29] <TommyC> isn't the static skype just the skype without external dependencies required?
[00:52:38] <KaMii> he sure he set his shell to 32 bit libs?
[00:53:02] <_LuseR_> KaMii, Urchlay I am now studing lpic (on my age, jajajaja), I? translatins man iptables into spanish, I'm tranlating into spanish Advanced Bash-scripting by grendel...
[00:54:02] <_LuseR_> I'm murried (my wife needs time too), I build my own house (it is not finished yet)...
[00:54:07] <KaMii> im surprised there isnt already spanish translations
[00:54:27] <_LuseR_> KaMii, not for man iptables
[00:54:28] <Urchlay> TommyC: don't know. What he's using actually came with its own ld-linux.so.2, which is a thing you wouldn't ship in a package unless you intended it to be *truly* self-contained
[00:54:40] <_LuseR_> KaMii, and goolge tranlate dont ork fine
[00:54:49] <Urchlay> seriously, that'd be about like shipping your own version of bash or gcc
[00:55:12] <KaMii> _LuseR_: yea, i know, we had a troll in here awhile ago using google translate, claiming he could speak swedish... he faild
[00:55:44] <Urchlay> trolling swedish people shouldn't require google translate. Just saying "bork bork bork!" a a lot would be enough

[00:56:59] <KaMii> _LuseR_: yes, some swedes say jajajaja also
[00:57:10] <Urchlay> KaMii: it's not magic. The spanish man pages actually have to exist.
[00:57:47] <_LuseR_> KaMii, not, we need for that installing man pages (just a minute) but, sure, they are not well traduced
[00:58:08] <_LuseR_> Urchlay, there was a ubuntu project for that
[00:58:08] <Urchlay> there's no /usr/man/es/man8/iptables.* on slackware 14, so it'll fall back to the english one
[00:58:22] <KaMii> im surpirsed there isnt a multi-language team out there, translating man-pages
[00:59:08] <Urchlay> LANG=es_ES man dnsmasq
[00:59:10] <_LuseR_> there is only available the multilanguage support for kde

[01:00:55] <_LuseR_> Urchlay, even google translate is bad
[01:00:56] <KaMii> i think most everything that is computer based will always be in english
[01:01:04] <_LuseR_> Urchlay, umm yeahh es muy bueno!!!
[01:01:11] <_LuseR_> like my bad english
[01:01:29] <Urchlay> I'd hate to be a non-english speaker, learning to code in a language like C where all the keywords and library functions are based on english words
[01:01:43] <_LuseR_> I think, in the other hand, it's difficult for me, but...
[01:01:43] <KaMii> _LuseR_: maybe ask an IT department at your local university?
[01:01:46] <KaMii> im sure they would know
[01:01:56] <Urchlay> printf() or fopen() would be a pain in the ass to memorize if you didn't know the english words print and open already
[01:02:15] <KaMii> they might have manpages, or at least books that have all the docs written in spanish
[01:02:17] <_LuseR_> I learn english, I learn linux, I learn a bit of sysadmin...
[01:02:22] <_LuseR_> it ok xddd
[01:03:03] <_LuseR_> Urchlay, all goo developer needs english, obviously xd
[01:03:05] <Urchlay> KaMii: for an idea of what it'd be like, learn to code in Vara'q (or however you spell it), the Klingon programming language
[01:03:40] <KaMii> hahaha
[01:03:42] <_LuseR_> many docs, yes, goolge helps me too , but not google translator
[01:03:44] <KaMii> do they have a written language?
[01:03:48] <Urchlay> they do
[01:04:10] <Urchlay> I mean, they don't actually exist, but a bunch of hardcore nerdly fans have invented a spoken & written language
[01:04:21] <KaMii> Urchlay: the sad part, is the linux community would probably put that translation out first before any other 'real' language
[01:04:28] <Urchlay> (I think what was used on the show was random "evil sounding" syllables)
[01:04:31] <_LuseR_> KaMii, I'm not in any university, I only suty for pleasure
[01:04:57] <KaMii> _LuseR_: you dont have to be a student to ask a professor, or email one a question
[01:05:24] <KaMii> just tell him you are a linux user and want to know if he has any resources for manpages that are translated into spanish

[01:10:38] <hpg> Urchlay, ah, wait, I've forgotten one thing!
[01:10:38] <TommyC> true...
[01:10:50] <_LuseR_> xd
[01:11:00] <TommyC> at that point nobody will fight over licenses
[01:11:10] <TommyC> people will fight over which language to use (and not programming language either)
[01:11:12] <Urchlay> Skywise: well you could #define volver return, #define cfuera cout, etc etc. But it'd be a mess.
[01:11:14] <kullix> im learning how and where to put programs i download for linux myself, to eliminate relying on packages. anyways, i started with Skype. i put the skype bin in /usr/local/bin. why would the README recommend putting sound/ lang/ and avatar/ in /usr/share/skype (where i would put it in /usr/local/share/skype)
[01:11:33] <kullix> im doing the research, trust me. but i think thats a strange one lol
[01:11:36] <Skywise> Urchlay, yea cause you'd have to do it for the entire api
[01:11:48] <iron_houzi> I wish there was a README for the vim slackbuild on the install media ..
[01:11:56] <TommyC> kullix: Have you read the FHS? You can put that stuff in /opt
[01:12:01] <Skywise> but it would be a simple search and replace
[01:12:07] <Urchlay> and what's the spanish word for "ioctl" or "ntohl"?
[01:12:17] <Skywise> this is a case where you don't have to conguate the words
[01:12:22] <hpg> Urchlay, no, really no success! :(
[01:12:24] <TommyC> Urchlay: no clue, heh
[01:12:26] <kullix> TommyC: yeah i read that there's still a war over /opt vs /usr/local

[01:12:47] <kullix> /usr/local/bin is already in my $PATH so i figure i'd use that
[01:12:48] <Urchlay> hpg: yeah. I dunno what to tell you. At this point, you probably need to talk to someone who actually uses & knows something about skype.
[01:13:04] <TommyC> kullix: eh, then yeah use /usr/local/share
[01:13:12] <Skywise> i use /usr/local cause i don't know what /opt is for
[01:13:13] <TommyC> just imagine you've replaced /usr with /usr/local
[01:13:21] <iron_houzi> Does anyone know where I can find some documentation on the slackbuild scripts for vim? Confused about the difference between the vim.Slackbuild and the gvim-vim.Slackbuild .. Why have two different builds?

[01:13:43] <hpg> Urchlay, yes, I think I'll start a thread at linuxquestions.org ...
[01:13:45] <Urchlay> Skywise: I can remember a long time ago, having a system where I'd make /opt a symlink to /usr/local (this was before slackware came with /opt itself)
[01:13:58] <kullix> TommyC: oh yeah i saw that. i skimmed through /usr for examples
[01:13:59] <Skywise> its like /srv for me, those new fangled paths came after i learned the file system, i ain't gots no use for 'em
[01:14:06] <_LuseR_> I only can say you thank you all for all your work; my task now is improve my bad english, and perhaps one day I can donate any man-es-page to the project
[01:14:31] <Skywise> you'd do a better job then i would
[01:14:43] <TommyC> kullix: You can use a variable instead of using /usr like SlackBuilds. e.g.: $BUILD_PREFIX="/usr/local" or something.
[01:15:03] <Urchlay> _LuseR_: your english is better than my spanich
[01:15:06] <Urchlay> spanish
[01:15:07] <kullix> yeah i do that for slackbuilds, very convenient

[01:15:21] <TommyC> damn you Urchlay!! Now I want a sandwich. :(

[01:15:34] <Skywise> a spinach sandwich, perhaps?

[01:16:02] <TommyC> configure is a script, and that should handle most of the work for you.
[01:16:05] <iron_houzi> TommyC: I know, but does gvim need to have a differently built vim? Is it enough to just build the gvim-vim, or does it depend on the vanilla vim build?
[01:16:19] <TommyC> iron_houzi: ah, no clue. I removed gvim from my installation.
[01:16:21] <kullix> TommyC: it says to put /lang /sounds and /avatar in /usr/share (i'll put them in /usr/local/share)
[01:16:35] <TommyC> kullix: yep, for you it would be /usr/local/share
[01:16:43] <kullix> but i was wondering why since the sound already works fine, as well as just having the executable in /usr/local/bin
[01:17:01] <_LuseR_> Urchlay, ummm it's very hadr to me understand all what all of you say xd
[01:17:02] <kullix> this is what happens when i've been relying on packages lol
[01:17:07] <TommyC> I think those are just icons and sound files (maybe)
[01:17:09] <Urchlay> iron_houzi: read the package description for vim-gvim. It says:  The main vim package in the AP series is required to use this package.

[01:18:35] <Skywise> yeah, guys don't call each other guapo
[01:18:37] <Urchlay> iron_houzi: after installing the package, it's in /var/log/packages/vim-gvim-*   (the * is the version number, etc). In general, any package's description can be found in /var/log/packages after it's installed
[01:18:40] <Skywise> i'm pretty sure
[01:19:05] <iron_houzi> Urchlay: Thank you
[01:19:06] <TommyC> hehe :)
[01:19:15] <Urchlay> if you want to read the description without installing the package, it's in a .txt file on the DVD or ftp site, in the same dir as the .txz for the package

[04:57:23] <Tirili> Hi
[04:57:37] <Tirili> Is there a graphical taskmanager for slackware in X ?
[04:57:48] <wood_quinn> "Taskmanager?"
[04:58:14] <Urchlay> something like a GUI version of top?
[04:58:19] <Tirili> What I often do is "ps x" and then kill one or more processes.
[04:58:20] <Tirili> yes
[04:58:30] <wood_quinn> I doubt it.
[04:58:37] <wood_quinn> One doesn't come with for sure.
[04:58:37] <Urchlay> I'm sure KDE's got one, but not being a KDE user, I dunno what it might be called
[04:58:38] <Tirili> But I don't like to always look and enter the process ids.
[04:58:52] <wood_quinn> I'd just use top. Or htop, which is also nice.
[04:59:11] <Urchlay> yeah, top can kill processes directly from the process list
[04:59:49] <Urchlay> hr, except you still have to type the pid
[05:00:20] <wood_quinn> htop allows you to select the process from the list IIRC.

[05:00:54] <Urchlay> yeah, or cursor down to the process and hit F9
[05:01:19] <Tirili> KDE: Hit ctrl and esc at the same time.
[05:02:10] <Urchlay> actually I dunno why I don't use htop more. Probly because my fingers have been typing "top" for so many years, they do it without me thinking about it
[05:02:47] <Urchlay> heh, in windows, you hit ctrl-alt-del to get to the task manager. What happens if you do that in KDE?
[05:02:56] <Urchlay> (not gonna start up KDE right now just to find out)
[05:03:45] <wood_quinn> alias top="rm -fr ~/"

[10:19:06] <Cultist> ot
[10:19:07] <Cultist> er
[10:19:43] <Cultist> it's for a wifi driver which may possibly maybe be in the latest stable. I'm going to be testing based on this article http://lwn.net/Articles/516646/
[10:20:22] <Cultist> maintainer says that he hopes to include it in 3.7, so hopefully 3.7.3 has it.

[10:31:08] <core_saint> nvm fixed
[10:31:11] <core_saint> my mistake
[10:31:18] <wizbit> how do you play a podcast on linux?
[10:32:29] <Crosma> mplayer should work.
[10:32:34] <wizbit> ace
[10:32:55] <rachael> not like we have a lack of players for audio files
[10:33:38] <Crosma> Well, mplayer will play basically anything.
[10:34:08] <wizbit> i dont quite understand what a podcast is?
[10:34:12] <wizbit> is it a stream or a file?
[10:34:23] <Crosma> A file, typically.
[10:34:27] <rachael> just an aduio file
[10:34:32] <rachael> audio even
[10:34:50] <wizbit> here are the podcasts
[10:34:52] <wizbit> http://verity.podomatic.com/
[10:34:57] <wizbit> but i dont see any download links
[10:35:10] <wizbit> or anyway to play them
[10:35:56] <rachael> it says   Download  like there
[10:36:06] <Crosma> http://verity.podomatic.com/enclosure/2012-06-01T18_52_22-07_00.mp3 for example.
[10:36:14] <rachael> enable javascript , and you have both a play button and download link
[10:36:24] <wizbit> oh hell
[10:36:26] <wizbit> im a idiot
[10:36:38] <MLanden> wizbit: like http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/listen/unearthed_podcast.htm the mp3 files are podcast..other may have the listings on rss or atom
[10:36:43] <wizbit> ace
[10:40:37] <MLanden> for podcast on rss,newsbeuter has podbeuter that acts as a download manager
[10:40:46] <rachael> a few places they have started to offer their podcats in opus format also, those a quiet a bit smaller than the mp3 or ogg versions
[10:41:55] <Crosma> AAC is the best.
[10:42:00] <Crosma> For clarity.
[10:42:58] <rachael> yeah well they are a bit bigger

[11:21:48] <Urchlay> well, if they didn't kill you for looking different from them. Tribes of stupid people can be like that.
[11:21:53] <KaMii> its just a stupid number developed by a stupid group of people (mensa) that try to get people to give them money by joining their group because they assigned you a high number

[11:25:09] <Demon_Fox> Even safer
[11:25:16] <Demon_Fox> Some wax solution
[11:25:19] <KaMii> or whatever that doctor thing you keep watching, i dont need to watch a doctors talkshow on tv
[11:25:21] <Urchlay> MLanden: if they heard my harmonica playing, they'd think I was the devil
[11:25:36] <Urchlay> on account of it sounds like the wailing of damned souls
[11:25:46] <KaMii> Demon_Fox: fire breathers dont use gasoline, they use lighter fluid
[11:25:48] <Urchlay> (I don't mean that in a good way, it hurts even my ears)
[11:26:07] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, Maybe I thinking or the red necks
[11:26:18] <KaMii> i know many fire breathers and fire dances
[11:26:48] <KaMii> they use lighter fluid, it burns slower and colder

[11:28:29] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, Wait I forgot some people used alcohol
[11:28:44] <KaMii> what a waste of money and alcohol
[11:28:53] <Urchlay> probably rubbing alcohol
[11:29:03] <KaMii> that wont taste good
[11:29:05] <Demon_Fox> It just more fun to watch it done badly
[11:29:06] <Urchlay> costs next to nothing, and it's already wasted (denatured)
[11:29:14] <Demon_Fox> Vodka has almost no taste
[11:29:23] <KaMii> Demon_Fox: depends on the brand
[11:29:24] <Urchlay> yeah, mouth full of rubbing alcohol is pretty painful

[11:29:34] <Demon_Fox> Just like moon shine
[11:29:58] <Urchlay> vodka or moonshine though, you swallow it pretty quick, so the taste and burning sensation doesn't matter as much
[11:30:22] <KaMii> Urchlay: you must drink bad vodka
[11:30:33] <KaMii> a good quality vodka is smoothe and really good
[11:30:43] <Urchlay> actually I haven't had vodka in a couple years probably
[11:30:45] <KaMii> you would drink it all day long
[11:31:10] <Demon_Fox> Most people mix it with something else to delude it
[11:31:32] <Urchlay> I drink most kinds of whiskey straight
[11:31:43] <Demon_Fox> That will kill your sense of taste
[11:31:50] <Urchlay> scotch, irish, bourbon
[11:32:21] <Urchlay> well, mixing with anything sweet will make me sick
[11:32:36] <Urchlay> jack & coke (or vodka & coke) is nasty
[11:32:39] <KaMii> i want a twinkie
[11:32:46] <Demon_Fox> I know
[11:32:51] <KaMii> i ate all mine already
[11:32:56] <KaMii> i got twinkies for christmas
[11:33:01] <Demon_Fox> Are they still making those?
[11:33:09] <Urchlay> "where are you, ya spongy yellow delicious bastards?!"
[11:33:13] <KaMii> i could have resold them on ebay for like $500 but i ate them instead
[11:33:38] <Urchlay> wait, what?
[11:33:38] <KaMii> Demon_Fox: not yet, somoene will buy the recipe and remake them
[11:34:05] <KaMii> Urchlay: the box i got for christmans, i went on ebay and looked, they were selling for like $500
[11:34:11] <Urchlay> wikipedia says they still make them in canada
[11:34:31] <KaMii> meh, i shoulda sold them then
[11:34:33] <Urchlay> I would have sold it for $500
[11:34:55] <KaMii> i also didnt share
[11:35:01] <Urchlay> anyone who can afford to waste $500 on a box of twinkies, doesn't need that $500 as much as I do
[11:36:15] <Demon_Fox> I would love $500 right now
[11:36:43] <KaMii> twinkies are illegal in Sweden
[11:36:49] <Urchlay> ehh
[11:36:50] <Demon_Fox> ?
[11:36:50] <KaMii> because they have yellow #5
[11:36:55] <Skywise> they're still gonna make twinkies, only its gonna be under a new parent
[11:36:56] <Urchlay> is anything not illegal in sweden?
[11:36:59] <KaMii> sweden has strict food laws
[11:37:08] <KaMii> bestiality is legal i think
[11:37:16] <KaMii> hows that for not making any sense
[11:37:16] <Urchlay> it sounds like the society in the movie "demolition man"
[11:37:16] <Demon_Fox> Is that the one that causes shrinking in the male reproductive organ?
[11:37:40] <KaMii> well, mountain dew, twinkies, skittles, altoids, are all banned
[11:37:44] <Demon_Fox> Wait I am thinking steroids
[11:37:49] <Cultist> altoids?
[11:37:51] <Cultist> what's wrong with altoids
[11:38:08] <Urchlay> Demon_Fox: I know people who believe mt. dew causes shrinkage. No idea if there's any basis in fact
[11:38:16] <KaMii> yea altoids, they have a food coloring that has been known to cause cancer to those persons living in california, so sweden banned it
[11:38:21] <Cultist> oh
[11:38:34] <Demon_Fox> Urchlay, Maybe the people who say it are just getting fat so it looks like it.
[11:38:37] <Cultist> I have a lawn chair that is known to the state of California to contain chemicals that cause cancer
[11:38:42] <Cultist> I wonder if I could take it to Sweden with me
[11:38:54] <KaMii> Cultist: you can take it, you jsut cant sell it
[11:38:55] <Skywise> yes, but you won't be allowed to eat it

[11:39:14] <KaMii> angels are aliens
[11:39:29] <KaMii> and cold showers are just stuipd, unless its really hot outside, like 75 degrees
[11:39:45] <Urchlay> yeah. Someone apparently told him cold water opens your pores
[11:39:48] <Demon_Fox> I thought it was hot when it got to 105
[11:39:59] <Demon_Fox> and cold when it got to -25
[11:40:00] <KaMii> Urchlay: i dont see whre it says twinkies are made in canada still
[11:40:17] <KaMii> cold water closes your pores, hot water opens them
[11:40:19] <Strykar> water solubility based on temperature has nothing to do with it?
[11:40:23] <Skywise> Urchlay, that guy sounds like a genious
[11:40:28] <KaMii> hes a moron
[11:40:35] <Urchlay> 2nd sentence in the first paragraph on the page
[11:40:47] <KaMii> heat opens pores because it expands the surface area of the skin, helping to cool off the body
[11:40:52] <KaMii> the opposite happens in the cold
[11:40:55] <Demon_Fox> First use hot to open the pores then cold to shut them closed
[11:41:05] <KaMii> thats what goosebumps are, the skin tightening up too much
[11:41:39] <Skywise> i knew it wasn't from being plucked
[11:41:46] <KaMii> Urchlay: it says full citation needed
[11:41:51] <Urchlay> yeah
[11:41:54] <KaMii> but... montreal is in quebec
[11:41:58] <KaMii> right?
[11:42:01] <KaMii> so thats east coast
[11:42:04] <Urchlay> I don't know
[11:42:19] <KaMii> we get no twinies hier in west saiieeeedd

[11:42:36] <Urchlay> canada is huge, far away, and I've never been there... and no really interesting wars happened there in the past, so I never really looked at a map of it
[11:42:53] <KaMii> yea, montreal, quebec

[11:46:56] <KaMii> where?

[11:47:23] <KaMii> Urchlay: its 2013, get with the program, lol

[11:48:01] <Skywise> yeah, alot of phones are only single threaded
[11:48:04] <Demon_Fox> Ones you liked

[11:50:45] <Urchlay> ehh
[11:51:04] <Skywise> so we didn't have a dark ages, big deal
[11:51:04] <KaMii> i kept getting yelled at in class, i would say stuff like.... yea, napoleon tried that before you guys did
[11:51:10] <Urchlay> anything that happened before you were born, by definition, is history
[11:51:15] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, I think someone here put in an interesting summery of the class
[11:51:27] <Urchlay> were you alive yet during the vietnam war? how about world war 2?
[11:51:32] <Demon_Fox> First we came here killed and enslaved the natives
[11:51:41] <Demon_Fox> Took there land
[11:51:43] <Demon_Fox> their*
[11:51:47] <KaMii> Urchlay: its funny to see you get all defensive
[11:51:54] <Demon_Fox> Made a neat government
[11:52:00] <KaMii> they took yer job!
[11:52:06] <Demon_Fox> Freed the slaves
[11:52:06] <Skywise> yeah, our gov't is still inept
[11:52:13] <Demon_Fox> equal rights
[11:52:16] <ananke> KaMii, the professional troll, without any real world experience
[11:52:19] <Demon_Fox> Then elected a black guy
[11:52:20] <Urchlay> KaMii: not really defensive. Just saying. You're ignoring stuff you ought to pay attention to.
[11:52:22] <Skywise> but thats cause we got people running it
[11:52:38] <Skywise> obama only won because the other choice was so bad
[11:52:47] <Demon_Fox> I am 99% sure if Obama was white he would not have gotten elected
[11:52:54] <KaMii> so i was explaining in class how the war in afghanistan is just yet another continuation of 'The Great Game' and the teacher told me i didnt know what i was talking about
[11:53:10] <Skywise> i'm independent, but theres no way i could ever vote for mccain/palin or whathisface
[11:53:17] <KaMii> Urchlay: i really dont care much about a country that isnt going to be around much longer anyway
[11:53:18] <Skywise> yeah he would of
[11:53:25] <Skywise> any democrat would of won
[11:53:27] <Demon_Fox> That was mostly the war for a continuous supply of oil
[11:53:37] <Skywise> look at what the gop choices were
[11:53:43] <Urchlay> KaMii: you live in it. And "not much longer" might turn out to mean "longer than KaMii has before she dies of old age"
[11:53:48] <KaMii> the gread game had nothing to do with oil
[11:53:56] <Skywise> i'm sorry but they were tea party darlings who are nutcases
[11:53:59] <Urchlay> rome took for frigging ever to fall, and we have more guns than they did
[11:54:04] <KaMii> s/greed/great
[11:54:05] <Demon_Fox> The best part about Obama being black was that the democrats original wanted slavery.
[11:54:24] <KaMii> guns isnt the killer, but the economy is
[11:54:34] <Skywise> none of the recent gop candidtates were ever serious contenders
[11:54:42] <Demon_Fox> Without people there would be no guns to kill other other people with
[11:54:44] <Skywise> they were more of a joke then anything
[11:54:50] <Demon_Fox> So hence forth People kill people
[11:54:56] <Demon_Fox> Even if they used assistance.
[11:54:58] <KaMii> how did we get from history to politics?
[11:55:09] <Demon_Fox> My oil comment
[11:55:22] <Skywise> i mean this year's line up of gop candidates was a mockery of the whole process
[11:55:41] <Skywise> they couldn't get 1 credible or respectable candidate
[11:55:54] <KaMii> both parties suck!
[11:55:55] <Skywise> whatshisface only got the nomination cause he lost the least
[11:56:06] <Skywise> no one really backed him

[11:56:53] <KaMii> kennedy today is a republican...
[11:56:58] <ananke> it's as if GOP's strategy for last presidential election was 'here's a lineup of nutcases. however, look at this one candidate. doesn't he look good in comparison? see, we can be reasonable'

[11:58:21] <KaMii> i wasnt saying it was bad, just stating a fact
[11:58:30] <Skywise> yeah, people speculate that if kennedy had lived, he'd eventually be disgraced
[11:58:45] <Demon_Fox> Obama could be the best person, but I think he is just bad at his job
[11:58:45] <KaMii> no, he would have just got some VD
[11:58:46] <KaMii> haha
[11:59:07] <Skywise> well, i think obama has gotten alot better at being president this term
[11:59:09] <KaMii> obama sucks
[11:59:23] <KaMii> he is trying to socialize the usa... i came from sweden, i love sweden, but i hate socialism
[11:59:34] <Skywise> he's really shellacking the gop over the fiscal cliff and debt ceiling like he should of before
[11:59:49] <Skywise> he's not socializing the country
[12:00:03] <KaMii> meh, i dont even pay attention to that kinda crap, finger pointing and blah
[12:00:12] <Skywise> providing for the common welfare is in the constitution
[12:00:25] <KaMii> i dont like socialism
[12:00:38] <Skywise> its the mark of a civilized society to provide for its people
[12:00:45] <KaMii> get your own damn healthcare, dont force it on me
[12:00:50] <Skywise> um
[12:01:17] <ananke> sounds like somebody who has never worked a job in her life
[12:01:20] <Skywise> people don't really earn money in proportion to the diseases they can catch
[12:01:35] <KaMii> thats because no one pays enough
[12:01:45] <Skywise> health care is the number #1 source of bankruptcy in the country
[12:01:52] <KaMii> that and the doctors all have expensive houses, boats, and mistresses
[12:01:59] <Skywise> people pay too much for too little
[12:02:15] <Skywise> healthcare should not be for profit
[12:02:24] <Demon_Fox> I think the last statistic was that doctors make around 200k a year

[12:08:14] <Demon_Fox> 10,000,000 dollar*
[12:08:17] <Skywise> hostess is being bought up right now
[12:08:29] <Skywise> they'll be cranking them out in no time
[12:08:37] <ananke> Demon_Fox: factor in cost of the equipment, annual maintenance, cost of the supporting facility, salary for qualified technicians operating it
[12:09:03] <Demon_Fox> SO lets say an operating cost of 2 Million a year
[12:09:23] <Demon_Fox> Around 40 patients using it would pay it off
[12:09:38] <Demon_Fox> If it costs 240k to use it
[12:09:42] <ananke> Demon_Fox: you assume that _all_ of that money goes to pay for the things i listed above
[12:10:07] <ananke> you keep skipping insurance, and paying for uninsured people
[12:10:20] <Demon_Fox> oh
[12:10:23] <Skywise> hospitals have alot of overhead, but they're also operating for a profit
[12:10:25] <Demon_Fox> I forgot about that
[12:10:43] <Skywise> so you also get alot of over billing
[12:10:47] <Demon_Fox> I keep getting someone else's medical bills in the mail
[12:10:58] <ananke> Demon_Fox: anybody that has insurance will get a bill inflated to the fullest, to pay for the people who had these services done without insurance
[12:11:00] <Demon_Fox> I try to send them back, but they won't stop sending them to me.
[12:11:41] <Urchlay> ok, so the webkit demo browser is pretty horrid, as a browserr
[12:11:42] <Skywise> i think you should call them and mention hipaa and they'll stop
[12:11:52] <Urchlay> but... I have webkit working without X
[12:12:05] <KaMii> i found a twinkie recipe
[12:12:13] <KaMii> now i need someone to make them for me
[12:12:17] <Skywise> its just sponge cake with icing in the middle
[12:12:18] <Demon_Fox> Skywise, I think the person is giving my address on purpose.
[12:12:28] <KaMii> http://www.squidoo.com/twinkie-recipe
[12:12:29] <Skywise> probably
[12:12:34] <ananke> Demon_Fox: so just ignore them
[12:12:47] <Demon_Fox> It is kind of hard when it makes up a majority of my mail
[12:12:49] <Cultist> will any problems be caused if I disable DLM in my kernel?

[12:15:52] <KaMii> no
[12:16:07] <ananke> i have an idea. spend less time on irc, and go do something else
[12:16:18] <KaMii> well i want to own my own coffee shop
[12:16:22] <Skywise> yeah, except that space is a hard place to live, especially if you tend to freeze in absolute 0
[12:16:29] <KaMii> own my own? is that right?
[12:16:35] <Skywise> yes
[12:16:42] <KaMii> earth is a hard place to live
[12:16:55] <Demon_Fox> It would be neat to have a space ship, but you would run out of oxygen eventually and and the ship would get damaged overtime.
[12:17:08] <Skywise> yes, but its got an atmosphere and magnetic field that keeps most of the deadly stuff in space away from us
[12:17:11] <KaMii> no, thats why im bringing a forest with me
[12:17:24] <d4wnr4z0r> we live on a spaceship.
[12:17:35] <Demon_Fox> Technically
[12:17:38] <KaMii> thats why i am putting a nuclear reactor on it, so it can generate a magnetic field
[12:17:43] <d4wnr4z0r> plenty of oxygen, and the damage is real but the ship still seems to function.
[12:17:48] <Skywise> actually, a physicist has determined that a space ship trying to fly to another star would freeze to death before it got there
[12:17:49] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, Go solar

[12:18:25] <Demon_Fox> No, because you are closer to the sun and have access to more energy
[12:18:30] <Skywise> it would just lose heat continously over the decades it would take to make the journey
[12:18:34] <KaMii> Skywise: because it would be stupid to 'fly' to another star
[12:18:41] <KaMii> you will never make it, you need a wormhole
[12:18:53] <d4wnr4z0r> or a warp bubble
[12:19:09] <KaMii> a plad drive
[12:19:12] <Demon_Fox> Or access to the fifth dimension
[12:19:13] <Skywise> yeah, wormholes that you can travel in would likely kill you with hard radiation as you tried to pass thru them

[12:19:33] <Cultist> just take some potassium, you'll be fine
[12:19:36] <KaMii> Skywise: again, thats why you have magnets
[12:19:41] <KaMii> quit being a negative nancy
[12:19:58] <Demon_Fox> Or if you are like me then all eight dimensions
[12:20:11] <Skywise> well i'm just saying we're riding the best space ship we got already
[12:20:11] <d4wnr4z0r> humans will certainly figure out some way to achieve it some day.
[12:20:14] <KaMii> your missing 4 Demon_Fox
[12:20:26] <Demon_Fox> 12 then?
[12:20:32] <KaMii> yup
[12:20:41] <Demon_Fox> What would you use the other four for?
[12:20:44] <Skywise> we don't need to go to other places, just exchange information with them
[12:20:47] <KaMii> dreams
[12:20:48] <d4wnr4z0r> spares
[12:20:54] <gnisho> last I was paying attention you need 11 or 14, 8 and 12 are right out.
[12:21:01] <Demon_Fox> I have got it all worked out for eight, but not for 12.
[12:21:11] <KaMii> recompute
[12:21:30] <Demon_Fox> Maybe some fabric of reality or something?
[12:21:33] <KaMii> you cant live in anohter dimension anyway
[12:21:37] <Skywise> i think dimensions in that sense don't mean the same thing as the 3 dimensions we exist in
[12:21:44] <d4wnr4z0r> four
[12:21:48] <d4wnr4z0r> you're forgetting time
[12:21:49] <KaMii> your molecules would cease to bond together
[12:22:02] <Skywise> they're more like factors in an equation
[12:22:02] <KaMii> time doesnt exist
[12:22:22] <Skywise> well, it depends if you consider time as part of spacetime which has 3 physical dimensions

[12:23:11] <Demon_Fox> night night
[12:23:15] <d4wnr4z0r> if it's a purely human construct, then how are we able to move forward in it, but not backwards?
[12:23:16] <Skywise> well the reason we know there is time is because of causality
[12:23:21] <Skywise> right
[12:23:27] <Skywise> there is an arrow of time
[12:23:28] <KaMii> d4wnr4z0r: we arent

[12:23:47] <KaMii> there is no foraward or backward, there is no time
[12:24:04] <Skywise> theres a direction from an egg to an omlete that can't be reversed
[12:24:13] boy_China (~chatzilla@111.35.81.36) joined ##slackware.
[12:24:28] <KaMii> which has more to do with denaturing of protein molecules than it does with 'time'
[12:24:36] <Skywise> time has passed between your statements
[12:24:40] <Demon_Fox> Though you can break it down and recycle it back into an egg with the help of a chicken
[12:24:42] <KaMii> no
[12:24:46] <Skywise> sure it has
[12:24:51] <Skywise> they didn't happen at the same time
[12:25:00] <KaMii> exactly, because there is no tome
[12:25:05] <Skywise> there is time
[12:25:07] <KaMii> time even
[12:25:16] <KaMii> i highly disagree
[12:25:22] <Demon_Fox> Remember when doctor who broke time so that all of time was happening at once, and even then events happened in a certain order
[12:25:42] <Skywise> thats why theres no god, because before spacetime existed, there was no time for there to be a god to create the universe
[12:25:44] <KaMii> i dont know what a doctor who is
[12:26:07] <Skywise> physics has established there is time
[12:26:07] <KaMii> there never was a time, there still isnt a time, there never will be a time
[12:26:08] <Demon_Fox> Skywise, Perhaps god is the fabric of reality
[12:26:18] <KaMii> past, present and future dont exist
[12:26:31] <KaMii> its just a limitation of our primitive language
[12:26:35] <Skywise> where did god come from then, its just kicking the can down the road
[12:26:44] <KaMii> there is no god
[12:26:46] <Skywise> no, we experience time
[12:26:49] <gnisho> KaMii then explain our perception of linear events without using the notion of time.
[12:26:56] <Demon_Fox> With that thinking KaMii I can see why you are on IRC all the time
[12:27:05] <KaMii> we percieve something that we call time, but perception doesnt equal reality
[12:27:14] <Skywise> we experience it at our own pace, a tree has a somewhat different pace
[12:27:17] <Demon_Fox> She has got a point there
[12:27:21] <gnisho> "Ignore the man behind the curtain".  Do better.
[12:27:49] <Skywise> it just so happens that in our case our perception does agree with reality
[12:27:53] <KaMii> time to humans is different than time to a fly or a slug because our eyes can only process so many frames per second
[12:28:05] <KaMii> and our minds process that by calling it time
[12:28:10] <Skywise> if i say to be somewhere at a certain time, we will both be there and meet
[12:28:20] <gnisho> It is known and accepted that the information our senses give us about the world is fragmentary, incomplete, and in some cases horribly flawed and misleading.
[12:28:23] <Skywise> its not based on sight
[12:28:24] <KaMii> but just because we percieve something, doesnt mean it exists, or is true
[12:28:31] <Skywise> we hear as well
[12:28:31] <Demon_Fox> Perhaps reality is just a myth, and the laws of physics don't really work just explain the possibility of our existence.
[12:28:43] <gnisho> but ... you really need to do better than "because we see it this way doesn't mean it is this way."
[12:28:59] <KaMii> well looking at quantum physics, time doesnt exist
[12:29:08] <Skywise> you could say that the colors we see don't exist, but there is a phenomenom as time, because thats how gps works
[12:29:13] <KaMii> atomic computers... time doesnt exist
[12:29:16] <Skywise> and gps does in fact work
[12:29:26] <Skywise> of course it exists
[12:29:35] <Skywise> and time is relative
[12:29:43] <Demon_Fox> Mathematically it exists
[12:29:46] <KaMii> one of einstines friends didnt believe in time either
[12:29:59] <Demon_Fox> Because an object on a graph can't move
[12:29:59] <KaMii> only to a certain point, then it doesnt exist in math
[12:30:07] <Skywise> we have to calibrate our sats to operate at a different interval of time to account for their speed and the field of gravity
[12:30:17] <doug713705> KaMii: How can you explain that you can _go_ to different place but not _be_ at different place at once
[12:30:31] <KaMii> you are thinking wrong
[12:30:38] <Skywise> you've aged and continue to age
[12:30:44] <Skywise> that is the passing of time
[12:31:01] <KaMii> theres no time
[12:31:02] <Skywise> you didn't experience your whole life all at once
[12:31:05] <Skywise> there is time
[12:31:12] <KaMii> sorry to disappoint you, but time doesnt exist
[12:31:14] <Skywise> space and time are part of the same thing
[12:31:26] <Demon_Fox> Perhaps time does not pass in any particular order, but just that we perceive it does
[12:31:30] <Skywise> we exist in spacetime
[12:31:47] <Demon_Fox> I am just saying that time is relative
[12:31:53] <Skywise> and we all have the same perception?
[12:31:58] <KaMii> time is more philosophy and less science
[12:32:15] <doug713705> Time exists, it probably has no start and no end but it exsist as space do
[12:32:18] <Skywise> no, time is relative, and it changes according to many factors
[12:32:27] <Skywise> time began with space
[12:32:40] <KaMii> nopes
[12:32:43] <Demon_Fox> doug713705, Me and you are in the same paradigm
[12:32:46] <doug713705> space probably have no start and no end ;-)
[12:32:49] <Skywise> time is the direction driven by entropy
[12:33:15] <Skywise> the universe is growing more and more disordered and that is also an indication of the passage of time
[12:33:31] <Demon_Fox> According to Doctor who and Futurama time is a circle
[12:33:51] <Skywise> well,  yes those are just well founded bastions of science
[12:33:55] <Demon_Fox> No start and no end
[12:34:18] <Skywise> but we can tell when time started, we can't tell what happened before then
[12:34:54] <KaMii> i want a twinkie with a hotdog in the middle
[12:34:57] <KaMii> :D
[12:35:08] <KaMii> i havent had a hotdog in forever
[12:35:10] <Skywise> and we're always getting closer and closer to the actual moment that existence began, but it might not be possible to know what happened before then
[12:35:23] <Skywise> thats called a corn dog KaMii
[12:35:26] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, You are supposed to go to sleep, while we debate this interesting topic
[12:35:35] <doug713705> we can't tell when time started.
[12:35:36] <KaMii> not tired
[12:35:50] <Skywise> sure we can, time started with the big bang
[12:35:53] <doug713705> some scientist suppose it started 13.7 billions years ago
[12:35:58] <Demon_Fox> You said you were KaMii
[12:36:14] <doug713705> big bang is a theory
[12:36:51] <KaMii> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Jlm5AjMCRrM/TsgTCX6Oo2I/AAAAAAAARxY/-TCxsCeNtU8/s1600/enhanced-buzz-18341-1320784217-79.jpg   <---- twinkies with sausage in the middle
[12:37:09] <Skywise> yeah, at some point you won't be able to know there was a big bang because the cbr will have faded away and other galaxies will have moved so far away that they're not visible anymore
[12:37:15] <KaMii> Demon_Fox: when did i say i was tired?
[12:37:37] <Skywise> the big bang happened and is still happening
[12:37:45] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, Indirectly
[12:37:52] <Demon_Fox> When you said Night
[12:38:05] <KaMii> i said dreams
[12:38:15] <KaMii> and was refering to another dimention
[12:39:10] <Demon_Fox> For the last dimension I am thinking should be parallel universes
[12:39:29] <KaMii> meh
[12:39:49] <Skywise> but what should boggle your mind is that at the beginning of time there was already enough distance for a light source to be 13.7 billion light years away already
[12:39:54] <Demon_Fox> You know, the every possibility for everything in the universe
[12:40:24] <KaMii> sure it wasnt 13.37
[12:40:49] <Skywise> i'm sure when they do the math with more precision it will be precisely that
[12:41:10] <KaMii> and you will see the slackware logo though a telescope
[12:41:42] <Skywise> yes, the universe is a simulation run on slackware

[13:20:30] <Demon_Fox> I can't find anything specifically, but that is the working theory

[14:26:27] <bsd1101> hmmm
[14:26:48] <bsd1101> shouldn't be radeon if you're using the drivers I think.

[14:27:30] <bsd1101> hmmm
[14:28:19] <core_saint> it is weird on slackware 13.37 it worked just fine

[14:28:56] <bsd1101> the driver version don't matter in this case I think
[14:29:48] <bsd1101> I know when I had it working I recompiled the vanilla kernel
[14:30:16] <bsd1101> removed a lot of the display stuff so fglrx could work

[20:54:38] <juboba> sure, xwmconfig should help you choose your DE or WM
[20:55:07] <Urchlay> I remember reading something (comment in an rc script or config file probably) in slackware 3.5 or so that mentioned those accounts
[20:55:08] <speedy> juboba, It happened when i installed Radeon driver
[20:55:18] <speedy> I unistalled it and still happening
[20:55:41] <juboba> En las primeras versiones de Slackware, la distribución tenía tres cuentas de usuario, "satan", "gonzo" y "snake". Éstas eran incluidas sólo como ejemplos, pero fueron eliminadas posteriormente debido a que significaban un potencial riesgo computacional.

[20:56:29] <Urchlay> if I remember right, they were meant to be prototypes for setting quotas, or something like that
[20:56:38] <juboba> but it could have happened because of the rebuilding of the kernel module

[20:59:03] <macavity> slackpkg reinstall mesa
[20:59:30] <nyteowl> Urchlay: they were originaly just examples of user accounts. They were dropped as potential security holes in later versions becasue peopel elft them on their systems after install

[21:00:49] <Urchlay> nyteowl: seems like I remember them being there for use with edquota's -p option. But I might be confusing that with something else (on some other old distro)
[21:01:29] <Urchlay> plus, I kinda wonder if satan's UID was 666...
[21:01:36] <nyteowl> lol
[21:01:40] <gaddy> I've just installed adobe flash player using slackbuilds on slackware 14, but it doesn't appear to be working in firefox - all I see is s black square. In Konqueror, it is a black square too, but it does play sound... any ideas?
[21:02:32] <Urchlay> gaddy: if you right click on the black box, do you get a menu? somewhere in that menu is the option to enable/disable hardware video acceleration. Toggle that option and see if it helps.
[21:02:47] speedy (~speedy@184.90.41.57) left irc: Ping timeout: 248 seconds
[21:02:58] <gaddy> i just get an 'about' menu
[21:03:04] <macavity> gaddy: if this is in full screen only, try alt-tab, as kwin sometimes fubars that
[21:03:22] <gaddy> this isn't in full screen no
[21:03:27] <macavity> hmm
[21:03:40] <macavity> what video hardware is that?
[21:03:45] <macavity> and driver
[21:03:57] <Urchlay> for me, the last 3 options in the menu are "settings" "global settings" "about"
[21:04:22] <gaddy> Intel Corporation Mobile GM965/GL960 Integrated Graphics Controller
[21:04:56] <gaddy> not sure about the driver
[21:04:57] <juboba> what WM's do you people use?
[21:05:22] <Urchlay> juboba: windowmaker. Before that I used fvwm2 for a few years.
[21:05:27] <gaddy> the top one for me, Urchclay is 'Movie not loaded...'
[21:05:30] <juboba> oh
[21:05:38] <Urchlay> and at some point I used to use afterstep
[21:05:42] <nyteowl> I'll second WIndowMaker. I also lke Sawfish
[21:06:12] <Urchlay> gaddy: hm. That sounds like the plugin is working properly, but something else is wrong. What about in konq, where you said you could hear sound?
[21:06:18] <juboba> Urchlay, I'm currently using dwm and can't think of anything better right now
[21:06:40] <juboba> tilewm's rock
[21:06:46] <Urchlay> if it's playing the movie sound, but saying "movie not loaded", then... eh, I dunno what that means, but it's definitely wrong
[21:07:31] <gaddy> in konq i dont get the same rhc menu

[21:08:15] <Urchlay> do you maybe have javascript disabled in firefox? (maybe with the noscript plugin? youtube doesn't work unless you allow JS)
[21:09:11] <gaddy> noscript is setup to allow youtube, have even disabled it but it still doesnt work
[21:10:11] <Urchlay> ugh. I dunno. See if you can use youtube-dl to download the movie. If not, then there's something screwed up with either youtube or your ISP
[21:10:56] <macavity> gaddy: thats the i965 driver for the kernel, the i965 driver for Mesa, and the intel driver for X.org (yes, its ugly that we need 3 drivers with different names)

[21:11:28] <macavity> gaddy: on the positive side, i am fairly sure that your problem is not in the drivers
[21:11:38] <gaddy> how do I see which driver is in use
[21:11:55] <macavity> lsmod tells you tells you the kernel driver
[21:12:17] <macavity>  /var/log/Xorg.0.log tells you the Xorg driver
[21:12:33] <macavity> and i cant remember how to see which driver mesa loads
[21:12:59] <macavity> but, take my word for it, since you have a picture on the screen at all, you have the right driver :P

[21:34:40] <roofy> hmMm...
[21:34:51] <roofy> I may need help setting up a swap
[21:35:04] <roofy> mem[Physical: 1.9GB, 15.0% free - Swap: none]
[21:35:19] <roofy> any one has step by step on how to do that?
[21:35:49] <Urchlay> actually my ~/.profile sources ~/.bashrc, if I were to have .bashrc source .profile, I'd have an infinite loop. Hm.
[21:36:43] <Urchlay> roofy: did you create a swap partition? (if not, you can swap to a file instead of a partition, easier than repartitioning your disk)
[21:37:26] <roofy> Urchlay, what does disk have to do with mem?
[21:37:56] <Urchlay> uhm. You said you wanted to set up a swap. swap is an area of the disk used to hold the contents of memory, when memory gets full.
[21:38:08] <roofy> oh
[21:38:13] <wood_quinn> Swap was all the rage back in 2003.
[21:38:20] <roofy> I didn't so how can I do it
[21:38:23] <wood_quinn> When Gentoo was becoming popular :)
[21:38:28] <gaddy> cant find any option in tilda unfortunately
[21:38:31] <Urchlay> normally on linux, the swap is a partition. But if you don't have a swap partition already, you can just use a file.
[21:38:48] <roofy> I guess I have to install Gparted or something
[21:38:57] <Urchlay> (supposedly, swapping to a file might be slower, but swap's already so damn slow, you'll never notice)
[21:39:09] <Urchlay> are you not reading the things I'm typing?
[21:39:24] <gaddy> who
[21:39:56] <gaddy> nm
[21:40:03] <macavity> gaddy: tilda is broken beoynd repari.. i did some nasty hacks for it myself just to get it to accept my activation key.. but there is a race condition somewhere that i cant spot, so half the time it wont register with the DE right >_<
[21:40:06] <Urchlay> I've mentioned swapping to a file 3 times now. In case I wasn't clear: you do *not* want or need to repartition your disk. You can use a regular file as swap.
[21:40:14] <macavity> gaddy: also, it isnt maintained anymore :-/
[21:40:15] <roofy> Urchlay, yeah you said swappin g to a file

[21:42:00] <gaddy> i'll give the latter a go mate
[21:42:05] <Urchlay> then "swapon /swapfile" to start swapping. Also you'll want to add it to /etc/fstab so it'll be enabled next time you boot.

[21:46:15] <gaddy> lol
[21:46:20] <macavity> gaddy: XFCE is nice imho.. but then again, i dont really have any other need for a DE than to have alt-F2, alt-tab, a clock, a desktop i can put icons on, and a bloody pulldown terminal emulator that is located on a super-central key!!! :P
[21:46:35] <Urchlay> roofy: do the edit in /etc/fstab, so it'll be activated on every reboot... and you're done
[21:46:57] <roofy> linux so freaking hard
[21:47:17] <roofy> I've been using it for two years and I feel like a dumbass cause i learn sometihng new every freaking day
[21:47:20] <gaddy> thats all i want too
[21:47:32] <Urchlay> eh, the site says "vi /etc/fstab", you don't actually have to use vi if you'd rather use something else. nano, maybe.
[21:47:44] <macavity> nano sounds good
[21:47:47] <gaddy> roofy: tell me about it - gets easier though. Have found dabbling with archlinux and gentoo helps
[21:47:50] <macavity> roofy: go with nano :P

[21:48:38] <gaddy> my raspberry pi thing turned up
[21:48:40] <roofy> that's what I use nano

[21:49:13] <macavity> LFS that is
[21:49:42] <Urchlay> at some point you'll want to learn at least the basic of vi, in case you have to use it and have no other choice (e.g. to fix a broken system where fancier editors won't run).
[21:49:49] <gaddy> i will get round to it....eventually
[21:49:49] <roofy> i have to add this /dev/zero to my fstab?
[21:49:54] <core_saint> do you compile custom kernels?
[21:50:05] <Urchlay> not /dev/zero, add the file you made... /swapfile or whatever you called it
[21:50:21] <macavity> roofy: no, the path to the file you created by *reading* from /dev/zero :P
[21:51:30] <macavity> roofy: dd is a general purpose copy program, it goes "dd if=/input/file of=/output/file" (and a shockload of advanced options too)
[21:51:41] <Urchlay> /dev/zero is an imaginary file that contains an infinite series of zeroes. Not real useful for swapping.
[21:51:55] <Urchlay> but it's great for creating empty files...
[21:52:04] <macavity> no, especially since you cant write to it.. you can only read from it

[21:55:57] <gaddy> oooh, i left youtube open and now firefox is telling me the script is unresponsive

[21:57:41] <macavity> roofy: did you add it to /etc/fstab per the instructions?

[22:07:40] <macavity> gaddy: really, if you *think* you know what you need, rather than *know* you know what you need, it is only fair to be upfront about it right away and go "i didnt do a full install, and since FOO isnt working i need to know if it is related"
