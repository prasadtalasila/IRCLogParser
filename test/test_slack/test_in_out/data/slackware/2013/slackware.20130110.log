[00:00:03] <KaMii> heviarti: yea
[00:00:13] <KaMii> worked just fine with my grandpas HP printer
[00:00:36] <KaMii> all i did was plug in the usp and hplip found the printer and started printing
[00:00:44] <KaMii> s/usp/usb
[00:01:02] <Zordrak> KaMii: Please, for sanity's sake, add a forward slash to your correction.
[00:01:26] <KaMii> Zordrak: please for sanitys sake, quit talking me
[00:01:38] <heviarti> i had to actually point it at the bus and device id before it would actually locate it.
[00:02:04] <KaMii> yea well i think in cli you have to manually set everything up
[00:02:19] <heviarti> brand new $500 printer and hp's crap no workee.
[00:02:24] <Zordrak> heviarti: Perhaps a little left-field, but you said it's brand new, is it supported in the version you're using?
[00:02:44] <Zordrak> Is there a more recent or dev version of hplip?
[00:02:51] <KaMii> heviarti: thats why you should always check openprinting forums first before buying a printer you want working on linux
[00:03:10] <heviarti> yes i'm pretty sure . lj pro 400 color m451
[00:03:20] <Zordrak> Just a thought.
[00:03:36] <heviarti> i looked to see if this was supposed to be supported and it said it was.
[00:03:55] <heviarti> brb, need to get clam chowder.

[00:10:11] <heviarti> and i haven't installed anything that didn't come with the dist yet.
[00:10:34] <KaMii> did you do a full install?

[00:11:47] lombardo (~dell@78.179.91.99) joined ##slackware.
[00:12:07] <heviarti> not even trying it as a user yet. i'm just trying to get to the point where the program will communicate with the printer.
[00:12:27] <lombardo> i tried arch linux but i coudnt boot into it.. it is weird, i am now installing slackware
[00:12:53] <KaMii> lombardo: what does arch have to do with slackware?
[00:13:15] <lombardo> i think its founder was inspired by slackware
[00:13:15] <heviarti> the fact that it's failure has lead him here.
[00:13:20] <lombardo> heh yeah
[00:13:40] <heviarti> my first slack install was due to redhat fail.
[00:13:56] <lombardo> slackware is always the best, you know you can rely on it
[00:14:31] <KaMii> heviarti: so, you still havent responded to my question, did you do a full install?
[00:14:53] <heviarti> not always true. yes, it's a full install.
[00:15:15] <KaMii> what WM/DE are you using?
[00:15:23] <lombardo> do any of you use linux on laptop? i wonder if there are tools for batery charge that if you keep it plugged always then it wont charge all the time because that is bad for the battery life
[00:15:36] <Zordrak> lombardo: most of us do
[00:15:39] <heviarti> good luck getting fsv2 to run on slack. running xfce.
[00:15:42] <wood_quinn> lombardo: I don't think you can.
[00:15:44] <KaMii> lombardo: i have many laptops
[00:15:51] <Zordrak> lombardo: the charge mechanism isnt controlled by the OS
[00:15:55] <wood_quinn> That would involve a controller in the hardware.
[00:16:03] <wood_quinn> Between the jack and the battery.
[00:16:14] <lombardo> some BIOS will have options for it, but this one has UEFI
[00:16:19] <KaMii> heviarti: click on xfce button --> system --> printing
[00:16:24] <heviarti> i think once the battery is charged the vrm just maintains the battery.
[00:16:51] <Zordrak> lombardo: disconnect the battery, run straight from the adaptor
[00:17:05] <lombardo> zordrak, right i could do that
[00:17:06] <TommyC> Zordrak: Can I /msg you?
[00:17:10] <heviarti> it shows it.
[00:17:16] <Zordrak> TommyC: go nuts
[00:17:26] <KaMii> then you lose your ups functionality without the battery
[00:17:46] <wood_quinn> UPS, pronounced "Oh crap!"
[00:17:54] <KaMii> better than DHL
[00:18:05] <wood_quinn> Or uh, oops.
[00:18:40] <KaMii> I always call it a U.P.S. just to annoy people, whene everyone else calls it an ups
[00:19:01] <KaMii> because ups to me, just sounds really stupid
[00:19:19] <wood_quinn> UPS: Gives you an hour of power after the line goes down, AND delivers packages in a giant black van.
[00:19:42] <KaMii> its not black, its dark brown with some green tint
[00:19:50] <wood_quinn> Oh. Never seen one up close.

[04:15:21] <lombardo> hey friends... do i install /KDE or /XFCE ?
[04:15:25] <lombardo> can i install both?
[04:15:39] <Jdogzz> You can install both.
[04:15:50] <lombardo> ok ty
[04:15:51] <Jdogzz> But if you want to save space then you can opt for one or the other.
[04:15:58] <lombardo> alright
[04:16:07] <lombardo> will KDE handle driver on its own?
[04:16:14] <lombardo> video driver
[04:16:50] <Jdogzz> I don't think KDE deals with the graphics drivers. That would be a kernel thing.
[04:17:10] <lombardo> hrm ok
[04:17:28] <Jdogzz> If you want proprietary support for your graphics card, assuming you are not satisfied with the one the kernel provides already, then you would simply need to install that driver.
[04:20:16] <shonudo> Jdogzz, i think you just appointed yourself ##slackware statistician
[04:20:21] <shonudo> granted, a job a bot could do
[04:20:29] <shonudo> but hey, the human touch; can't beat it
[04:20:38] <shonudo> :)
[04:21:10] <heviarti> wow. hplip is total crap.

[04:23:17] <Nova_Man> or even printing ?
[04:23:20] <shonudo> or any DE, for that matter?
[04:23:46] <Nova_Man> dont install anything.... send me the item.. I will print it.. put it in the mail.. and then whalah... you will have your print out in 5 to 6 weeks ;)
[04:23:54] <Jdogzz> Statistics has always seemed so boring of a subject, I just like to look at the graphs:)
[04:24:19] <heviarti> i'm using xfce's printer setup.
[04:24:20] <Jdogzz> heviarti: What problem are you having with hplip, or do you just not like the way it handles things?
[04:24:21] Action: Nova_Man grabs his CUPS driver.
[04:25:11] <heviarti> jdogzz: it would not detect my printer when hooked to usb.
[04:25:26] <shonudo> use CUPS, get it set up, and then _look at it_ through whatever gui thingy your de provides

[04:26:24] <Nova_Man> or really enjoys the way your touching its keys..
[04:26:24] <heviarti> then i tried probing for it after changing it to jetdirect, and it wouldn't detect the printer.
[04:26:43] <Jdogzz> heviarti: Does it not work after specifically adding it through hp-setup?
[04:26:55] <heviarti> and i think the xfce print manager is just an interface to cups

[04:27:43] <heviarti> nova: yup. it's set to 10.0.0.200
[04:28:02] <Nova_Man> ok.. and your network is 192.168.1.1 right ? :)
[04:28:04] <heviarti> jdogzz: m451dn
[04:28:30] <heviarti> nope, i'm set to 10.0.0.2 and the router 10.0.0.1
[04:28:53] <Nova_Man> yay.. Im a social engineer ;).
[04:30:17] <heviarti> i'm not worried. my only net is via my phone. good luck getting in.
[04:31:06] <Jdogzz> Have you checked to see if it's one of those weird printers on https://www.openprinting.org/printers?
[04:31:08] <Nova_Man> you loaded the "HP Printers - Driver Support for Linux OS"
[04:31:35] <heviarti> nova: what now?
[04:32:45] <Nova_Man> everything re that printer directs me to http://hplipopensource.com/hplip-web/index.html?
[04:32:54] <Nova_Man> it shouldnt have a problem printing.
[04:34:54] <Jdogzz> That's a strange one then.
[04:35:00] <heviarti> ok, my buddy's ubuntu machine prints to it, and yet cups on the slackware box won't.
[04:35:38] <Jdogzz> Is your user both a member of sys and lp?
[04:35:40] <heviarti> the moment i try to print a test page it barfs. instantly.

[04:36:05] <Nova_Man> yeah.. what Jdogzz said..
[04:36:13] <Jdogzz> That should work then...

[04:42:19] <Demon_Fox> Did the name libre in libre office come from the spanish word for book?: "Libro"
[04:42:21] <heviarti> yeah. the log is kind of dense though.
[04:43:26] <Nova_Man> time for some fishing ;)
[04:43:44] <heviarti> we're going to try another machine with a fresh slack install and see if it barfs too.
[04:43:46] <Demon_Fox> More like phishing
[04:44:00] <Nova_Man> ok
[04:44:11] <heviarti> if it does the problem is with slack.
[04:44:23] <Nova_Man> or the way you configured it ?
[04:44:26] <Jdogzz> Demon_Fox: I think it came from "Libre", the word the English borrowed from the French to mean free.
[04:44:53] <Nova_Man> Jdogzz... so Libre free... means free free ?
[04:44:58] <Demon_Fox> perhaps it might have been a combination of things?
[04:45:10] <Demon_Fox> Jdogzz, They both seem to make sense, don't they?
[04:45:16] <Nova_Man> heviarti.. pastebin the last of the log.
[04:45:39] <Jdogzz> More or less:) This Wikipedia article will explain the meaning: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libre

[04:49:10] <wood_quinn> Magic and magnets.
[04:49:31] <Nova_Man> Jdogzz.. cause it sets in the west.. so it had to come up somewhere...

[08:25:52] <gnisho> Personal experience with Mageia is that it's okay on a VM but release 2 liked to do bad things on real hardware.
[08:25:53] <Name141> and I was too bummed out to mess with trying to fix it, since other distros worked right off bat..

[08:26:32] <Name141> fuzzix: no idea, it scared me away
[08:26:52] <fuzzix> Maybe it's not for you if you scare easily.
[08:27:19] <Name141> indeed.. which is why I went on to Fedora.
[08:28:02] <fuzzix> Fedora changes frequently, it's Red Hat's test whipping boy. If you scare easily...
[08:28:51] <Name141> I suppose ubuntu is the only "LTS" (3 year) distro ?
[08:31:41] <Urchlay> I dunno about mandrake/mandriva, but e.g. the Debian non-free repository just means "software not licensed with a Free Software license", you don't pay for access.
[08:31:54] <fuzzix> I dunno, check out slackware security advisories, patches are provided for releases going back to '07 and earlier :)

[08:32:34] <Urchlay> Light Tuna Sandwich
[08:32:37] <Name141> Urchlay: debian wouldn't let me use it's mirrors during setup , saying something about them not supporting the release I had..over and over.. I tried about 5-10 mirrors on the list and it all gave me an error
[08:32:52] <Name141> they all
[08:33:24] <Urchlay> Name141: eh, that I don't know about. Were you trying to install with a really old install disc or something? (I haven't really ever used Debian on my own machines so I'm not expert)
[08:33:39] <Name141> Urchlay: No, it was the new 6.0.6
[08:34:04] <Urchlay> maybe the mirrors hadn't yet been updated, so they didn't include the new release yet? (just grasping at straws here)
[08:34:15] <Name141> beats me.. I gave up on it too
[08:35:17] <Urchlay> I kinda like the idea of installing an OS from CD or DVD (without any need for mirrors on the network)
[08:35:31] <Urchlay> old-fashioned of me I guess
[08:35:40] <Name141> it needed them to configure apt
[08:35:58] <Name141> Urchlay: that could also be said about retail games that are Steamworks these days.
[08:36:14] <Name141> I don't want to download a 500 MB update, when I just got the disk..
[08:37:04] <Urchlay> well, eh, that can happen with Slackware too. If there've been a lot of security patches since release, you'd want to install them.
[08:37:18] <Urchlay> (but you'd do that after install, not during)
[08:38:04] <Name141> I was just comparing an installer smacking you (the user) around
[08:38:55] <fuzzix> Urchlay: Tch, just chroot to your new install, get the network stack going and do it ;)
[08:39:10] <Urchlay> sure, that works too

[09:39:48] <kryptoz> I did not do anything special. The truth is even though I do believed you guys, i still wanted to see one more time if kde hangs or come up!!
[09:40:01] <kryptoz> maybe that X -configure did all the magic !
[09:40:10] <TommyC> indeed, X is pretty good at configuring itself now.

[10:06:40] <kryptoz> Hi, got one doubt with slackpkg.. the mirrors file documentation says, only one mirror at a time. In case if I wanted to add "http://slackbuilds.org/slackbuilds/14.0/" along with the normal repo, its not possible ?
[10:07:01] zakame_ (~zakame@210.213.136.182) left irc: Ping timeout: 248 seconds
[10:07:52] <Nh3xus> you can use the slackbuilds.org repo with sbopkg
[10:07:57] <Nh3xus> not with slackpkg
[10:08:04] <Urchlay> slackpkg is only for official slackware packages (not slackbuilds.org)
[10:08:28] <Nh3xus> slackpkg only provide you updates for your slack 14 or current system
[10:08:39] <KaMii> slackbuilds has no binaries anyway
[10:09:06] <Nh3xus> Yeah you still have to download the sources along with the slackbuild manually
[10:09:22] <KaMii> then run the slackbuild and hope it compiles

[10:11:03] <FrankD> Nh3xus: oh it'll blend!
[10:11:13] <KaMii> or put those gpu's to work and start folding on boinc
[10:11:37] <FrankD> theyre crunching F@H
[10:11:54] <FrankD> i think i need a bigger power supply, I'm afraid to run the SMP stuff along with the GPUs
[10:12:08] <KaMii> meh, i got tired of folding@home and moved up
[10:12:17] <FrankD> GPU combined TDP is 600w by themselves
[10:12:19] <KaMii> i use my gpu to compile milkyway@home
[10:12:30] <FrankD> dunno how much the board uses, or how much the CPUs use loaded up
[10:12:43] <FrankD> theyre 95w TDP, but i doubt they use that much

[10:14:43] <Nh3xus> FrankD : Dunno, but it's a possible use of your setup
[10:14:50] <FrankD> i didn't get my case in yet so I just cut up 3 strips of angle aluminum and drilled/tapped it for standoffs
[10:15:16] <KaMii> do a sweet custom case
[10:15:17] <FrankD> then i realized there's no way to mount hyper 212+s to a c32 motherboard... so i had to make some brackets for them
[10:15:30] <FrankD> eventually, for now i ordered a nice 4U rackmount case
[10:15:38] <FrankD> its impossible to find them with more than 7 expansion slots
[10:15:47] <FrankD> Nh3xus, yeah i run F@H
[10:16:02] <KaMii> i thought they were done folding protein chains
[10:16:25] <FrankD> done? never!

[10:17:11] <FrankD> that's the case im waiting on, im going to mill something up out of aluminum later.. that'll do for now though :)
[10:18:48] <KaMii> well, i guess if they constanly mutate, then yea, they will never finish
[10:19:04] <FrankD> i have to replace the CPUs at some point too.. using opty 4184s, basically the same as a phenom ii, 6 core 2.8GHz... i really want the 4386, 8 core 3.1GHz w/ up to 3.8GHz turbo
[10:19:33] <KaMii> what bank did you rob?
[10:19:55] <Nh3xus> FrankD : dude i think you can even do DNA sequencing
[10:19:56] <KaMii> and will you pay me a, I will stay silent, fee?
[10:20:01] <FrankD> haha i wish
[10:20:23] <FrankD> i grabbed the cpus off of ebay, a pair of them for $157 shipped
[10:20:45] <FrankD> and the tyan s8225.. $72 off so it was only $408

[16:40:06] <Cultist> never used it
[16:40:34] <Cultist> not usually a fan of spinoffs though
[16:40:38] <core_saint> bedtime, i think slackware is the only linux distro without dependancy resolution out of the box
[16:41:05] <eviljames> false.
[16:41:07] <eviljames> Linux From Scratch.
[16:41:11] <bedtime> core_saint, what about lfs?
[16:41:13] <gnisho> http://funroll-loops.info/   all you'll ever need to know about gentoo ; - )
[16:41:18] <eviljames> gnisho++;
[16:41:28] <eviljames> Here's the truth of the matter: Slackware is the most unix-like of Linux distros.
[16:41:36] <core_saint> lol
[16:41:41] <eviljames> If you want to have your hand held and do things in baby steps, use any other distro.
[16:42:06] <bedtime> well, most gentoo users dont use funroll-loops
[16:42:28] <core_saint> not really.. i wouldn't say that having a dependacy is a holding someones hand
[16:42:53] <bedtime> i just wanna learn linx a little more. dig a little deeper
[16:43:21] <Roin> Well nobody will hold you back in that efford
[16:43:22] <Roin> :D
[16:43:47] <gnisho> Eh, dependency tracking can be a good thing, but I've seen it horribly abused.  Compile everything with every optional feature requiring foolib, foolib2, barlib37, bazlib14.12 ... and next thing you know you need 217MB of dependancies for a text editor.
[16:43:48] <ananke> if you want to learn, fine. just don't pretend that dependency solving is something that's akin to hand holding. not everybody pretends to be manly by doing ton of unnecessary work
[16:44:14] mindware (~mindware@5-13-221-137.residential.rdsnet.ro) joined ##slackware.
[16:44:25] <ananke> we've moved past the days when it was required to compile os from scratch just to have it working
[16:44:34] <bedtime> lol gnisho
[16:44:47] <gnisho> I only wish I was exaggerating.
[16:45:16] <core_saint> agree with ananke, that said i love slackware... and always will ;)
[16:45:17] <eviljames> If you want to know how and why your system works, take the time to learn Slackware.  You'll end up knowing more about all other Linux distros.
[16:45:20] <ananke> gnisho: nobody considers emacs to be a text editor :)
[16:45:38] <gnisho> bootloader away from world domination, yes.
[16:45:38] <bedtime> gnisho, i know. i wanted to install apple for networkmanager. an APPLET. thats all. 40 deps :/
[16:45:48] <bedtime> applet*
[16:46:30] <bedtime> i could only imagine installing that applet on slackware xD
[16:46:39] <ananke> not to mention, complaining about dependency tracking is silly, when what you're listing is related to dependencies themselves
[16:47:10] <core_saint> slackware is great, very simple and straight forward but i am glad for tools like sbopkg and slapt-get
[16:47:20] <gnisho> ^
[16:47:23] <bedtime> ananke, i was saying that i want to handle the deps myself. the reason is that i jsut want to learn more aboout whats going in and out
[16:47:27] <ananke> on a side note, here's a bit of consumer friendly service, finally: http://www.macrumors.com/2013/01/10/amazon-launches-autorip-offering-free-digital-versions-of-purchased-cds/
[16:47:41] <eviljames> Is there someone here who works on slapt-get ?
[16:47:42] <ananke> bedtime: of course. for educational purposes, that works great

[16:48:16] <bedtime> one thing i dont like is that apparently this is not a source-based distro
[16:48:19] <eviljames> ananke: Good. ;)

[16:48:45] <eviljames> On the one hand, sarcasm, but on the other hand, I'd prefer people never recommend using tools liek that.
[16:48:56] <ananke> other than 'good for him', because he'd receive plenty of abuse from uneducated folks
[16:48:56] <eviljames> third-party emulations of bad package managers don't belong on Slackware (IMHO)
[16:49:04] <ananke> eviljames: why not?
[16:49:27] <ananke> slapt-get in itself does nothing out of ordinary than what slackpkg does
[16:49:29] <Roin> so heading home see ya o/
[16:49:52] <eviljames> ananke: Well, since the dawn of sbo the incidence of people coming in having hosed their system via slapt-get (or lp.net) has gone way down.
[16:49:54] <ananke> and having a tool where _syntax_ is similar to the tools you may use elsewhere is a very good thing [tm]

[16:51:29] <ananke> on that note, atool software with aunpack and aupack tools is great, if you deal with random archives, and don't want to be bothered with remembering silly syntax for each type of utility
[16:51:37] <gnisho> Ubuntu ignoring standards.  Discuss.
[16:51:50] <eviljames> I _still_ haven't figured out why, but I don't care.  It solidified for me that {install,upgrade,remove}pkg are still the correct tools.
[16:51:59] <ananke> gnisho: that stems from their roots: debian ignoring standards :)
[16:52:07] <eviljames> haha yeah
[16:52:12] <core_saint> no distro flamewar... we all love slack ;)... some of us just can appreciate tools like sbopkg and sometimes slapt-get
[16:52:35] <ananke> it's all about knowing the limits of a tool, and using it properly
[16:52:54] <ananke> removepkg won't hold your hand either when you attempt to remove something
[16:52:56] <NightTiger> And others of us never use sbopkg OR slapt-get, but prefer SlackBuilds.Org

[16:53:11] <eviljames> Do one thing and do it right, something along those lines?
[16:53:13] <core_saint> sbopkg is using slackbuild
[16:53:26] <ananke> how can you 'prefer' something without never trying the alternative?
[16:53:38] <eviljames> NightTiger: yeah, sbopkg fetches/builds (and queues fetches/builds for rudimentary dep resolution) from slackbuilds.org
[16:53:47] <Skywise> i'd like a straight forward way to see what other packages depend on a package
[16:53:50] mikef (~mike@140.105.36.207) joined ##slackware.
[16:53:59] <eviljames> Skywise: you go to slackbuilds.org and look at dependencies in the README.
[16:54:01] <eviljames> tah dahhhhh
[16:54:18] <Skywise> no, that would tell the dependencies of the package its self
[16:54:26] <eviljames> oh, sorry, I misread
[16:55:13] <Cultist> why would it matter what packages might depend on a particular package? if you need it for something you should already know, and if you will be needing it you probably shouldn't install it until you actually need it anyway
[16:55:20] <Skywise> but i just got bit by upgrading cyrus-sasl, and theres alot of stuff that depended on it and using the older version
[16:55:37] <eviljames> Wait, that was a surprise?

[16:58:44] <Skywise> i just ended up recompiling  .23 with the options i needed
[16:58:48] <eviljames> Skywise: Did you try running ldd against a broken binary to see if it coudl be resolved with a symlink?
[16:59:31] <Skywise> i even tried installing over the default package and that broke things
[16:59:44] <Skywise> so theres some internal version checking going on

[17:01:31] <gnisho> *nods*  might be possible to extract new packages and manually drop in minor version changes with exact naming.
[17:01:46] <Skywise> whatever was linked against the old libs should of been fine and the new stuff with the new libs
[17:01:53] <gnisho> if the application is wanting an exact version it may be smart enough to call for it.

[18:29:55] <Skywise> that sounds efficient
[18:30:06] <eviljames> Still better than NetworkManager
[18:30:07] <bedtime> evil, i suggest maybe an upgrade to 16GB xD
[18:30:21] <eviljames> bedtime: Between that and Chrome I was using 8GB + 3GB swap hahahah
[18:30:31] <Skywise> maybe eschelon was back logged and it was caching the data
[18:30:37] <eviljames> Closing the wicd client freed up no fewer than 6.5GB RAM and 1.5GB swap
[18:30:51] <bedtime> eviljames, hmmm, maybe i should get a better computer before installing slack xD
[18:31:03] <Skywise> seems something is slighty wrong with that configuration

[18:54:15] <wizbit> otherwise i will need to keep manually looking at dmesg to make sure there are no read/write errors listed in it

[19:25:27] <wizbit> mdadm has a nice email feature
[19:25:47] <erikkugel> mdadm rocks in general, but its much more sophisticated than fsck
[19:25:58] <erikkugel> I mean in scope
[19:26:13] <wizbit> my 2 OS drives in RAID-1 are covered with this:

[19:27:02] <eviljames> Yeah, plenty.
[19:27:12] <wizbit> how often do you check them for badblocks?
[19:27:13] <eviljames> SSD OS drives that are direct images of one another.
[19:27:25] <eviljames> We don't.  When the drive fails, replace it and RMA
[19:27:42] <wizbit> sometimes the drive will still work but produce _LOTS_ of read/write errors

[19:27:47] <wizbit> not
[19:27:49] <eviljames> Yeah, that's called 'failing'

[19:31:29] <wizbit> smart does not work on all drives
[19:31:36] <eviljames> erikkugel: Yeah, it's one of a few checks we have in place.
[19:31:39] <erikkugel> ...that's also true
[19:31:53] <erikkugel> I had to write something like this for windows : fsck with alerts.
[19:32:03] <eviljames> It's by far the most trivial way to get basic monitoring of disks up & running though.

[19:42:35] <bedtime> well, the installer will let me download packages from the net, will it not?
[19:42:43] <erikkugel> ananke, often when the drive starts failing the filesystem gets corrupted.
[19:42:49] <eviljames> bedtime: yeah, ftp or whatever
[19:42:58] <eviljames> erikkugel: s/often/sometimes/
[19:43:04] <bedtime> okay, then i'll just download the usb isntall iso then
[19:43:07] <erikkugel> in our experience - often
[19:43:21] <eviljames> erikkugel: If the failed blocks aren't metainfo, the drive may or may not remap them or may just silently say that everything is A-OK
[19:43:27] <wizbit> smartd is hidden in rc.M
[19:43:47] <Zordrak> erikkugel: depends a lot on whether your failure is hardware or firmware
[19:43:56] <Zordrak> hardware failures are less likely to cause FS corruption
[19:44:00] <ananke> erikkugel: 'often'. but not always. and filesystem errors also don't indicate hardware problems
[19:44:05] <erikkugel> I did not say always
[19:44:10] <erikkugel> I said often
[19:44:26] <ananke> erikkugel: so checking for filesystem errors is as reliable indication of a failing disk as results of smart
[19:44:45] <erikkugel> in our experience - fsck is much more reliable.
[19:44:53] <erikkugel> much more. Not totally.
[19:45:23] <ananke> erikkugel: so you have a lot of resources that have single disks for storage?
[19:46:24] <erikkugel> We have (unfortunatly) a lot of RAID setups, for which smart is useless, but we also have a lot of virtual infrastructure, for which smart is also useless. Then, we have a lot of old servers with no redundancy.
[19:46:50] <eviljames> wait, why would you say that smart is useless for a RAID?
[19:47:05] <erikkugel> well, not for all raids.
[19:47:11] <erikkugel> for us, we use perc controllers
[19:47:14] <eviljames> oh, you've got hw raid that doesn't expose the disks
[19:47:22] <ananke> i was about to say, checking filesystems in most production environments is a bit pointless, as a disk failure won't result [shouldn't] in filesystem corruption. you monitor the raid controller
[19:47:22] <erikkugel> exactly :)
[19:47:49] <ananke> you use dell's omsa to monitor those, and you'll get the result of disk failures
[19:48:07] <erikkugel> we use dell's omsa and a bunch of other monitoring tools.
[19:48:19] <erikkugel> Sometimes, I think we have too much monitoring.
[19:48:41] <Zordrak> erikkugel: as long as its not manual, you can't have too much
[19:48:44] <erikkugel> What I really like is monitoring that alerts of upcoming failiures. I had not found smart helpful with that. I did find chkdsk and fsck to be very helpful
[19:48:48] <Zordrak> nagios ftw
[19:48:59] <erikkugel> when level 1 calls every 5 minutes with false alerts - its too much
[19:49:03] <Zordrak> nagios+sms for the better
[19:49:05] <ananke> i wouldn't want to deploy nagios in 2012
[19:49:15] <wizbit> smartctl -s on eviljames

[19:49:24] <Zordrak> ananke: ?

[19:53:47] <wizbit> should smart be turned on if 2x drives are in RAID-1 mdadm?

[19:54:11] <ananke> wizbit: uhmm, mdadm won't be doing any major checks

[20:36:43] <shadowsun> test all the smart things ;)
[20:36:46] <wizbit> ok
[20:36:57] <eviljames> err
[20:37:05] <eviljames> shadowsun: are you supposed to test smart on partitions?
[20:37:07] <wizbit> is that a smart thing to do?
[20:37:13] <shadowsun> eviljames: Not really
[20:37:19] <eviljames> s/really/at all/
[20:37:22] <shadowsun> I just woke up and haven't had coffee
[20:37:26] <eviljames> ah
[20:37:33] <eviljames> COMMENT APPROVED, DESPITE ITS ERROR.  PROCEED WITH CORRECTIONS.
[20:37:35] <wizbit> ive already done fsck checks on all my drives

[20:38:08] <shadowsun> wizbit: smartctl -t long actually has the drives run a full test on the media.. It'll find any bad/uncorrected sector issues and give you a pretty solid idea if everything's great or not
[20:38:13] <Invitado> fsck only checks filesystems
[20:38:20] <wood_quinn> wizbit: Sorry I was kidding.
[20:38:28] <wood_quinn> Should have kept an eye on IRC.
[20:38:31] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[20:38:50] <eviljames> shadowsun: Also, if your drives are near-failure, -t long should cause them to fail outright! ;)
[20:39:04] <wood_quinn> Mine are near-fail

[20:39:10] <shadowsun> eviljames: Yes ;) But if they're near failure and you don't know it, you haven't been monitoring smart properly ;P
[20:39:13] <wood_quinn> I don't know how much that matters thoguh.
[20:39:24] <shadowsun> wood_quinn: What part of them is near fail?
[20:39:26] <eviljames> As long as the data is unimportant, it doesn't!
[20:40:16] <shadowsun> If the data was important, you'd have a copy of it elsewhere ;)
[20:41:16] <wizbit> wood_quinn: kidding about what?
[20:41:53] <wood_quinn> When I told you not to do "it"
[20:42:21] <wood_quinn> I should actually start copying anything important to my flash drive. I'm not really worried about it though.
[20:42:48] <wood_quinn> I can't replace the drives so it's a moot point.

[20:44:50] <eviljames> How is losing the data a moot point?
[20:47:06] <hackedhead> eviljames: if it's worth less than you can afford to spend on replacing/protecting it.
[20:47:10] <shadowsun> wood_quinn: Why can you not replace the drives?
[20:47:30] <shadowsun> Since it seems like that's actually the core question
[20:47:53] <eviljames> Drives are cheap and replaceable.  Data is not.

[21:26:58] <eviljames> Skywise: If the metric is producing noise & smells, probably.
[21:27:08] <eviljames> Skywise: but in terms of measuring when a disk is going to fail, I don't want to know how you test that with your ass.
[21:27:17] <Skywise> my ass will mor reliably tell you when your drive will fail then smart
[21:27:36] <eviljames> You should sell it to a major hard drive vendor.

[21:28:59] <TommyC> Is there a way to remove stale directories from left over packages? If I remove ghostscript and ghostscript-fonts, it'll keep the /usr/share/ghostscript/* director(y|ies) because both packages put stuff in that directory, but pkgtools won't remove both since it picks up new files in there (and these aren't new files, they're just files from the other package)?
[21:29:38] <TommyC> and by "remove stale directories" I mean actually finding them. Not "rm -r /path/to/dir" of course.

[21:44:39] <Skywise> and
[21:44:58] <eviljames> and don't provide so much as an unreliable metric of drive health, let alone a reliable one.
[21:45:13] <Skywise> yeah, that really doesn't mean anything tho
[21:45:41] <Skywise> you never really know when the drive is going to fail, or why a sector went bad
[21:45:50] <Skywise> you find those out when you try to use the drive anyway

[21:57:31] <eviljames> smed: NO.
[21:57:32] <Skywise> yeah, its never given me useful warnings in any of the failures i've had
[21:57:32] <smed> I figure my odds aren't too good.
[21:58:24] <eviljames> Skywise: So did it warn you or didn't it?

[21:59:35] <eviljames> Skywise: Your statement implied that it did warn you, but the warnings weren't 'useful'

[22:00:14] <eviljames> It is worth mentioning that the earliest smart implementations were somewhere between imperfect and total garbage.

[22:00:56] <Skywise> it said it didn't give me anything useful, which also includes nothing
[22:01:34] <Skywise> either way, i just use raid so failures aren't that big a hassle

[22:04:14] Action: wizbit thinks RAID is a bad hack
[22:04:28] <Skywise> its fault tolerance, not backup
[22:04:30] <eviljames> Ok, Skywise's opinion on smart seems justified in comparison to that one.

[22:05:41] <eviljames> Skywise: fwiw, I use smart to try to predict failure, rather than wait for things to fail.  If we start seeing errors from a going-to-fail disk, it gets hot swapped and RMA ASAP.
[22:05:54] <wizbit> ok one more reboot, this is it
[22:07:01] <Skywise> when a drive fails, i remove it from the array and put it to sleep and then when i come out i hot swap it
[22:07:02] <Nova_Man> Have to agree with Eviljames there, though I dont like the lack in some cases of information garnered from the smart system.

[22:17:57] <Jdogzz> Do you rip them all to your hard drive because you're paranoid or do you have some sort of media server set up?
[22:19:28] <eviljames> bedtime: thank your friendly neighborhood Alan_Hicks & his cohorts for that one.
[22:19:32] <Skywise> i rip my music so i don't have to handle the discs anymore
[22:19:43] <bedtime> eviljames, :)
[22:19:49] <wizbit> Jdogzz: mythtv

[22:22:19] <Jdogzz> Someone yesterday said they wanted a Slackware phone, that would be nice to have.
[22:22:46] <Skywise> i think typing on a phone all the time would not be so awesome
[22:23:04] <Jdogzz> It would be better if I didn't have to recharge my phone every 5 hours because of some background process.
[22:23:20] Action: TommyC still uses a flip phone.
[22:23:34] <Jdogzz> I don't mind typing on my phone if there's a physical keyboard, these virtual ones, on the other hand, are something else...
[22:23:44] <Nova_Man> TommyC.. ahh.. but do you also have a Magnum PI tache... to go with it ?
[22:24:22] <eviljames> Jdogzz: Samsung's Swipe interface.  better than typing imho
[22:24:28] <eviljames> at least, on mobile.
[22:25:16] <Jdogzz> That's the one where you slide your finger right? I didn't care for it, took too much energy to do that for every single word. I use SwiftKey for the predictive text thing, saves tons of time.
[22:26:21] <eviljames> Jdogzz: yeah, I haven't used swiftkey, but once I got the hang of swype it didn't matter.. I was hooked.
[22:26:35] <Skywise> i'm not sure what i want out of mobile computing, a combo phone/gps seems cool, and then maybe a netbook for a computer
[22:26:53] <Skywise> but i don't like these large format phones now
[22:27:22] <eviljames> I used to be of the same opinion.. I thought for sure the galaxy s2 was going to be so obnoxiously big that I'd never hold it to my head and always use a bt headset or something.
[22:27:26] <eviljames> I was wrong.
[22:27:53] <Skywise> the note is almost as big as a paper back
[22:27:57] <eviljames> With a caveat: the Samsung Note (and it's 5"+ bretheren) are too big to be useful phones, but too small to be useful tablets.
[22:28:12] <eviljames> haha bigger than most on my bookshelf

[23:23:06] <macavity> you mount the dvd-iso via loopback, cd to the right dir on it, run the script with your usb device and the mountpoint of the iso as the arguments, and violla :-)

[23:35:58] <eviljames> Probably impossible because Xfinity have probably locked down the firmware and refuse to open those ports except to their machines so they can backdoor your network.

[23:36:38] <KaMii> this is why i always use my own equipment, also you don thave to pay a rental fee to use their cabel modem

[23:37:59] <eviljames> Sounds right.
