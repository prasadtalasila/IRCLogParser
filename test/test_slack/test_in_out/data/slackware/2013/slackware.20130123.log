[00:06:48] <KaMii> you know the norwegians invented the toilet seat
[00:06:57] <pink_mist> I have a keyboard that has swedish in white colour, and norwegian/danish in blue/red colour ... not sure which of them is which :P but one of them has ö and ä switched
[00:07:06] <KaMii> but it was us Swedes that perfected it... we put the hole in the toilet seat

[01:09:07] <KeshlWare> I don't know, exactly, how, to, do that in Linux but it can't be much more complicated than "Hit one of those weird keys, see what signal it produces, write a special case for it", right?

[01:28:38] <BrokenCog> it looks good.  I think it works in linux, says osx so probably.
[01:28:44] <macavity> gnisho: it looks at sysfs and /proc/cpuinfo, so it wasnt half bad for a first try :P

[01:53:50] <KaMii> anyone know of a good tool that will show your total network usage on your home network?
[01:53:57] <KaMii> like, upload and download?
[01:54:15] <KaMii> i guess it would have to pull directly from the router
[01:54:35] <macavity> that depends on the router
[01:54:41] <shonudo> build a snort box
[01:54:50] <KaMii> shonudo: how do I do that?
[01:54:50] <shonudo> use wireshark or whatever it's called now
[01:55:00] <macavity> i bet you can hax something up with dd-wrt if your router is supported
[01:55:20] <shonudo> check out wireshark and see if that's the way to go, KaMii
[01:55:31] <shonudo> it may be just enough (and not too much) to do what you want
[01:56:00] <pink_mist> wireshark sounds like way too much for that 0_o
[01:56:06] <shonudo> heh
[01:56:27] <macavity> shonudo: that would require the NIC to be set in promiscuous mode
[01:57:03] <shonudo> i have a comeback for that that will get me banned
[01:57:08] <shonudo> so never mind
[01:57:11] <macavity> :P
[01:57:45] <macavity> the point being, it would require that some machine on the LAN is always on, and is inspecting all trafic
[01:58:01] <pink_mist> KaMii: if you have a linux box as your router, I'd run iftop or iptraf on it
[01:58:09] <macavity> that wouldnt work on my LAN, as wired and wireless network is segregated completely
[01:58:59] <KaMii> pink_mist: i dont, i have a motorola surfboard, and im about to plug in my linksys dd-wrt into that and use the linksys as the router and the surfboard will just be a cabel modem
[01:59:24] <pink_mist> KaMii: well, your linksys should be able to run iftop or iptraf
[01:59:33] <pink_mist> maybe with a new firmware
[01:59:35] <shonudo> or you can build a box, install snort, and use that
[01:59:37] <pink_mist> but it should be doable
[01:59:58] <KaMii> im installing wireshark now, going to see if that will be enough
[02:00:11] <KaMii> if it works with conky, I will be soo happy
[02:00:12] <shonudo> it should be just enough and not...
[02:00:13] <shonudo> lol
[02:00:18] <macavity> KaMii: if you have dd-wrt'able gear then the sky is the limit :-)
[02:00:36] <KaMii> http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.0/network/etherape/  <-- looks nice but it has too many dependencies
[02:00:53] <shonudo> etherape?
[02:00:57] <macavity> KaMii: you can even get it to update a txt file that you can fetch via ftp regularly
[02:00:58] <shonudo> ehter ape
[02:01:05] <KaMii> macavity: i do have that, just dont want to go offline to set it all up
[02:01:06] <macavity> KaMii: all the trafic info is in /sys/
[02:01:08] <shonudo> ether ape?
[02:03:00] <shonudo> tbh, that's overkill

[02:38:20] <Blueleaf> pink_mist, tried it as root, and it did its thing (used -v to see someoutput) but cryptkeeper still doesnt see encfs, and encfs install says it needs librlog which i just installed
[02:39:17] <BrokenCog> Blueleaf: pastebin the error.  are you on 32bit or 64b? multilib or not?
[02:40:48] <Blueleaf> b
[02:40:55] <Blueleaf> brokencog, 64 multlib

[02:42:14] <BrokenCog> Blueleaf: yes, that  was my guess.  look at the error when encfs compiles ... does it say "/usr/lib/librlog..." not found?  it's looking for the lib in the 32bit dir, but you installed it into /usr/lib64
[02:42:56] <Skywise> i was also thinking he might just need to supply the configure option with the path
[02:43:00] <BrokenCog> if this was a configure/make/intsall cycle, follow AlienBOB's multilib instructions on compiling for 32bit, and install them as well.
[02:43:14] ryerke (~bert-mage@m9e0536d0.tmodns.net) left irc: Quit: leaving
[02:43:37] <BrokenCog> Skywise: that would work, if he knows how to configure configure.
[02:44:03] <Skywise> he could edit the build script i guess
[02:45:02] <BrokenCog> probably something like 'sh configure --with-rlog=/usr/lib64'
[02:47:46] <Blueleaf> skywise, brokencog i got it to work, not sure how, probably just user head space error
[02:47:52] <Skywise> i think the build script also adds that to the library search path
[02:48:02] <Skywise> good
[02:48:23] <Blueleaf> skywise, brokencog or maybe installing encfs after ldconfig??
[02:48:39] <BrokenCog> yes.
[02:49:27] <Skywise> you normally wanna run ldconfig after installing a library

[03:00:31] <KaMii> ok that fixed it.. now i get Conky: can't open display:

[03:01:21] <BrokenCog> /etc/sshd/sshd_config has X11 forwarding enabled? and you sh /etc/rc.d/rc.sshd restart 'd ?
[03:01:32] <KaMii> yup
[03:01:47] <KaMii> well it passed all the ssh x forwarding stuff
[03:01:57] <KaMii> now im just trying to figure out how to get conky to play nice
[03:03:59] <BrokenCog> " display every system's network" clever ... but ... really?
[03:06:15] <ananke> somebody clearly has no clue what SNMP can be used for
[03:07:00] <pink_mist> ananke: what program(s) would you use for what KaMii wants then?
[03:07:08] <ananke> 'here, let's reinvent the wheel, poorly. with sticks. and snorkels'
[03:07:08] <BrokenCog> or ntop or flow or iftop or snort or ...
[03:07:45] <ananke> pink_mist: snmpd on each system. and any of the snmp clients
[03:08:08] <ananke> BrokenCog: snort is an NIDS. completely different beast
[03:08:27] <BrokenCog> ananke: true, but the frontends are decent traffic analyzers.
[03:08:52] <BrokenCog> (assuming they can be made to work)
[03:08:54] <ananke> BrokenCog: that's like trying to kill a fly with an elephant gun. the overhead is just absurd
[03:09:26] <ananke> you don't need to perform deep packet analysis to measure traffic on an interface
[03:09:27] <BrokenCog> ananke: true, but somehow a better solution than -display'ing conky from haly a dozen machiens.
[03:09:42] <ananke> BrokenCog: i'd argue that both methods are equally poor
[03:09:55] <BrokenCog> ananke: okay. I won't argue that.

[03:14:18] <Skywise> iftop is good for monitoring bandwidth
[03:14:19] <BrokenCog> ananke: KaMii I think that comes from not reading books ... it's hard to learn from others.
[03:14:35] <BrokenCog> ananke: sorry.
[03:15:06] <KaMii> does ntop or iftop require root?
[03:15:10] <ananke> Skywise: iftop is great, i use it almost daily. unfortunately, doesn't solve the issue of multiple systems
[03:15:32] <Skywise> i think iftop does
[03:15:35] <BrokenCog> doesn't it have a flow output?
[03:15:50] <KaMii> i really dont want to have to use root
[03:16:05] <BrokenCog> parents locked you out?
[03:16:09] <wood_quinn> Accessing the network interface that way is going to require root.
[03:16:17] <Skywise> i think anything thats going to monitor ports is gonna need root
[03:16:43] <wood_quinn> Unless there's some tool out there to sit between your software and the network as a proxy and analyzer.
[03:16:45] <KaMii> BrokenCog: no, its my internet, im the one that pays for it
[03:16:58] <BrokenCog> don't all routers made since ... ever ... have up/down stats?

[03:38:36] <BrokenCog> FatalNIX: what does `file /etc/profile.d/32dev.sh` return?
[03:38:38] <FatalNIX> then obviously it's not going to be there if it didn't install

[05:38:52] <Blueleaf> shonudo, whereis tar finds it in /bin/tar among otherplaces

[05:42:05] <shonudo> http://slackware.osuosl.org/slackware-14.0/source/a/tar/
[05:42:10] <shonudo> go there, Blueleaf
[05:42:14] <shonudo> install it
[05:42:22] <pink_mist> shonudo: ... *how* would he install it?
[05:42:22] <Strum> tar is a cpompression utility
[05:42:25] <Blueleaf> shonudo, will do
[05:42:35] <shonudo> shit
[05:42:37] <shonudo> lol
[05:42:41] <pink_mist> shonudo: he needs tar to untar those
[05:42:47] <shonudo> point taken pink_mist
[05:43:02] <Blueleaf> shonudo, i feel like i am reading catch 22.....
[05:43:11] <shonudo> so... i think your install is borked
[05:43:26] <shonudo> but htf did you do a full install and not get tar?
[05:43:27] <pink_mist> Blueleaf: thing is .. if you don't have tar, you definitely did not do a full slackware install :>
[05:44:05] <pink_mist> it is one of the first things to actually be installed
[05:44:31] <shonudo> yeah, this doesn't make sense
[05:44:43] <Blueleaf> shonudo, your probably right, but it was a full install, even got dev and games..
[05:45:11] <shonudo> well, you got games at least :P
[05:45:14] <shonudo> heh
[05:45:16] <wood_quinn> If you have /bin/tar and running it says "No such file or directory" you dun screwed something up.
[05:45:20] <shonudo> you're install is totally f'ed
[05:45:26] <Blueleaf> how can whereis find it but its not there?
[05:45:28] <shonudo> and all i want to know at this point is how
[05:45:44] <wood_quinn> Did you do multilib?
[05:45:45] <pink_mist> Blueleaf: you'll need to dig out your install medium and mount your partition, use installpkg with the proper options to have that install tar for you
[05:46:01] <Blueleaf> wood_quinn, yes
[05:46:09] <wood_quinn> There ya go.
[05:46:14] <pink_mist> Blueleaf: but .. if you somehow managed not to get tar ... you probably messed up other things in your install too. so REDO IT

[05:47:02] <Blueleaf> pink_mist, i think i will, but i dont understand how it can be there and not, and have man pages is not installed
[05:47:05] <shonudo> would love to know how it got that way
[05:47:35] <Blueleaf> could it be something wierd like a PATH entry?
[05:47:40] <wood_quinn> Nope.
[05:47:44] <wood_quinn> Just reinstall.
[05:48:03] <wood_quinn> No sense in trying to figure out why, just fix it.

[05:50:11] <shonudo> and you don't need to worry about that
[05:50:13] <pink_mist> ... actually, there is one thing
[05:50:16] <shonudo> just do a full install
[05:50:18] <pink_mist> that *might* work
[05:50:28] <pink_mist> to untar a tarball without tar
[05:50:43] <pink_mist> if you want, I can check a bit..
[05:50:47] <shonudo> what witchcraft is this pink_mist!

[05:51:00] <shonudo> lol
[05:51:02] <shonudo> nice
[05:51:14] <shonudo> good idea, actually
[05:51:17] <Blueleaf> how can i have installed everything i have without tar??
[05:51:28] <shonudo> that's what we said
[05:51:28] <wood_quinn> Using the installer's tar.
[05:51:30] <shonudo> :P
[05:51:55] <pink_mist> shonudo: perl has an 'Archive::Tar' module that it ships with by default
[05:51:58] <wood_quinn> Point being, rather than being incapacitated while trying to figure out what happened, just fix it.
[05:52:02] <Blueleaf> wood_quinn, the installer has its own tar??
[05:52:05] <pink_mist> .. would just need to figure out how to use it :P
[05:52:22] <pink_mist> the install medium does :> installpkg doesn't
[05:52:26] <Blueleaf> pink_mist, ive never done perl....
[05:53:44] <pink_mist> Blueleaf: well, have a look at: perldoc Archive::Tar
[05:53:55] <Blueleaf> pink_mist, but i have install slackbuilds and i pretty sure from source on this install
[05:54:27] <pink_mist> Blueleaf: maybe you hosed your system by getting a non-native binary on it :>
[05:54:52] <shonudo> Blueleaf, you're probably at a point where a reinstall is in order
[05:54:55] <shonudo> just do it
[05:55:07] <shonudo> it'll actually take less time than anything else
[05:55:13] <pink_mist> yeah
[05:55:27] <pink_mist> especially since we can't know what else you might have hosed
[05:55:28] <Blueleaf> shonudo, if i contaminated it with non natives, how do i keep from doing it again (i dont learn well)
[05:55:39] <wood_quinn> You don't do weird stuff.
[05:55:45] <shonudo> Blueleaf: you just do a straight reinstall
[05:55:48] <shonudo> nothing else
[05:55:50] <Blueleaf> wood_quinn, thats where the fun is
[05:55:52] <shonudo> absolutely nothing lese

[06:20:09] <shonudo> lol
[06:20:15] <KaMii> thats what I was thinking
[06:20:28] <KaMii> and I will get at least $5 of entertainment value out of it

[06:20:47] <KaMii> microwave?
[06:20:52] <wood_quinn> By browsing kitten porn.
[06:20:56] <shonudo> if you end up with LEDs that still flash, you've got a nightlight
[06:21:05] <shonudo> oh! microwave it!
[06:21:17] <shonudo> and report back after the fire is put out

[06:27:09] <wood_quinn> Most likely it'll eventually become conductive.

[09:32:45] <Urchlay> still. GTK user interface, without X. And it renders whatever page you give on the command line, beautifully.
[09:33:33] <ventYl> Urchlay: so maybe the bug is somewhere in input interface path?
[09:33:49] arkydo (~arkmillo@unaffiliated/arkydo) joined ##slackware.
[09:34:09] <Urchlay> likely the bug is in the directfb code in gtk+
[09:34:27] <Urchlay> it never was very well maintained (they dropped it after 2.18.x)

[09:41:41] <ventYl> the only worst thing i've ever built is ffmpeg and related stuff

[09:42:34] <ventYl> i tried to build slackware 13.37 sbos on Powerpc
[09:42:40] <ventYl> gtk relies on both pango and cairo
[09:42:49] <ventYl> pango depends on cairo
[09:42:52] <Urchlay> I remember trying to build all of slackware 10.0 on ppc64
[09:42:53] <ventYl> cairo depends on pango

[09:45:23] <ventYl> i have working both KDE and GTK (and also oxygen-gtk) but another fubar thing is radeon drivers. respectively DRM support itself
[09:45:40] <Urchlay> probably my half-assed gtk stack would crash, if I actually tried to use anything that uses libpoppler-glib
[09:47:07] <Urchlay> (hm, I did try to build zathura with poppler support, it would render PDFs but crash if I tried to zoom. Maybe that's why.)
[09:47:24] <Urchlay> zathura with poppler and without X, I mean.
[09:49:14] <Urchlay> so far the only app I've gotten to work 100% perfect with gtk-directfb is pqiv (image viewer, uses gtk but doesn't draw any widgets). And FBReader *almost* works perfect (part of the display doesn't always refresh, otherwise seems correct)

[10:02:12] <Urchlay> the stuff I'm building is 2d only... but there's work being done on supporting OpenGL in directfb. Don't think it's very functional yet.
[10:02:29] <ventYl> wayland's approach is something like: get rid of X and whole graphics server. give every window it's own framebuffer where it can draw what it want and give application access to HW acceleration
[10:02:35] <Urchlay> (fully accelerated quake without running X would be hilarious)
[10:03:28] <Urchlay> I mean, that's how quake used to work, on the old voodoo 2 cards. svgalib for mouse/keyboard, and glide for rendering

[10:08:09] <Urchlay> wayland is probably only a little higher level than directfb is
[10:08:45] <Urchlay> (directfb is a higher level of abstraction than mmap'ing /dev/fb0 and banging pixels at it, but not much higher)
[10:09:01] <ventYl> from drawing perspective it's the same level
[10:09:28] kkady32 (~matrix@unaffiliated/kkady32) joined ##slackware.
[10:10:14] <ventYl> when you create window wayland gives you linear framebuffer of size of your window which is in fact texture which compositor uses for window drawing
[10:10:24] <Urchlay> nice
[10:10:48] <Urchlay> and the framebuffer lives in the graphics card's ram?
[10:11:05] <Urchlay> (compositor = a piece of hardware on modern cards, yes?)
[10:11:22] <ventYl> dunno if it's possible to map something like OGL texture directly into process memory
[10:11:53] <ventYl> compositor = piece of SW, which creates oGL scene and then draws it
[10:12:24] <Urchlay> so it at least gets some help from the HW
[10:13:01] <ventYl> if you don't move mouse pointer and don't move windows it's possible that compositor will be totally inactive because whole scene can be drawn solely from graphics card
[10:13:16] <ventYl> the only thing which compositor need to do is trigger drawing
[10:13:55] <ventYl> needs*
[10:14:00] nullby7e (~null@unaffiliated/nullby7e) joined ##slackware.
[10:15:50] <Urchlay> hm. So here's a thought (that might be wrong). An app like a clock (digital clock, like wmclock). Right now, in X, the numbers are rendered by the X server, in response to the app sending a chunk of pixels... with the compositor, you'd want to pre-render all the digits in the clock, and the app just tells the compositor which ones to draw?
[10:16:03] <Urchlay> (pre-render into video card's memory I mean)
[10:16:19] <ventYl> nowadays fonts are rendered on application side
[10:16:29] <ventYl> and are transferred to X server as bitmaps
[10:16:32] <KaMii> brick a brick
[10:16:38] <wood_quinn> Bummer.
[10:17:06] <KaMii> i can jtag... i never done that before
[10:17:08] timahvo1 (~rogue@41.212.120.45) left irc: Ping timeout: 256 seconds
[10:17:15] <Urchlay> well, these aren't actually fonts. I mean yes they are, but they don't use a regular X font or freetype lib or anything. They're just graphics that happen to look like numbers
[10:17:16] <ventYl> jtag to tokyo?
[10:17:26] <KaMii> jpop
[10:17:41] <ventYl> Urchlay: so they are probably bitmaps and are transferred from app to X server
[10:18:07] <Urchlay> yeah
[10:18:41] timahvo1 (~rogue@41.212.120.45) joined ##slackware.
[10:18:43] <Crosma> X11 is awesome.
[10:18:52] <ventYl> IIRC X has concepts of drawables. these are displayable and non-displayable pixel buffers stored in X server which you can copy from and to and also draw into
[10:19:07] <Urchlay> in wayland, would you transfer them all at once to the compositor, at app startup, and then when you display the time, you tell the compositor which ones to display where? (and if the display hasn't changed, the compositor doesn't actually have to do anything?)
[10:19:33] <ventYl> right now I don't remember how actual drawing is performed because it's several years I've written some X11 code
[10:20:08] <ventYl> Urchlay: in wayland compositor gives you framebuffer of your window's size and you can do anything you want with it
[10:20:37] <ventYl> you can map it in your memory and in order to draw you don't need tell anything to compositor
[10:21:06] <Urchlay> ok, so the app doesn't really have to talk to the compositor (except maybe to make its entire window disappear/reappear)
[10:21:44] <ventYl> yes, wayland protocol has mostly WM, input and IPC calls
[10:22:07] Strum_1 (~Strum@122.151.143.235) joined ##slackware.

[10:25:09] <wood_quinn> So Wayland is basically throwing away the display server and saying "Let's just run a window manager on the framebuffer!"
[10:27:26] <ventYl> better said: let's throw all unnecessary call and data path which slows things down
[10:28:01] ferdna (~ferdna@cpe-72-178-6-83.elp.res.rr.com) left irc: 
[10:28:47] <ventYl> and do as much as possible on graphics HW which is better suited for this task
[10:29:09] <wood_quinn> Man I don't know why people feel the need to do things all diferently-like.
[10:29:17] <wood_quinn> Why can't we all just be happy with TWM :(
[10:29:26] <Urchlay> so it's like directfb, only with compositing
[10:29:36] <wood_quinn> Memory leaks bring great joy and many offspring.
[10:29:41] <Urchlay> (from the app's point of view, it's a lot like directfb, I bet)
[10:30:27] <ventYl> wood_quinn: transition from X11 to wayland will be quite like transition from quartz compositor to quatrzxtreme compositor in X11 between versions 10.1 and 10.2
[10:30:43] <ventYl> 10.1 and older performed most of window compositing in software
[10:31:07] <Urchlay> so someone's gotta write a wayland backend for gtk and qt, right?
[10:31:22] <wood_quinn> That's what I've heard.
[10:31:27] <ventYl> 10.2 and up uses similar approach and on really slow machine you can feel dramatic speedup
[10:31:55] <ventYl> Urchlay: gtk already has wayland backend. qt5 too
[10:32:27] <wood_quinn> There's a Qt5?
[10:32:29] <Urchlay> there's a qt5 already? did they completely break backwards compatibility with qt4, the way qt4 did with qt3?
[10:32:34] <wood_quinn> Kapeesh I'm out of the loop.
[10:32:55] <ventYl> dunno anything about it. qt5 is thing of last few weeks
[10:33:01] <Urchlay> the utter & complete lack of backward compatibility would have made me quit developing for qt, if I'd been doing so
[10:33:55] <Urchlay> heh, setting CC="ccache distcc gcc" actually works
[10:34:09] <ventYl> uh oh
[10:34:26] <ventYl> i only tried distcc between xserve and powerbook
[10:34:28] <wood_quinn> ruh roh?
[10:34:39] <ventYl> without ccache
[10:34:52] <Urchlay> the only way to run slackbuilds faster would be to use quantum entanglement to have the CPU retrieve the object code from the future, where it's already been compiled :)
[10:35:07] Action: wood_quinn votes for that solution.
[10:35:14] <Urchlay> also, that sentence should contain the word "tachyon" somewhere
[10:35:19] <wood_quinn> Can you have an SBo for that by this weekend?
[10:35:21] <wood_quinn> Thanks.
[10:35:37] <Urchlay> sure, but you're supposed to ask if I can have it by last weekend :)
[10:36:20] <wood_quinn> Disaster, shields down, tachyon emmitters, enemy ships destroyed
[10:36:32] <wood_quinn> Man, I should write a new Star Trek series.
[10:36:43] <wood_quinn> I got an episode down in one sentence.
[10:36:48] <ventYl> Urchlay: distcc can be configured to distribute complete preprocessing + compilation + linking, not only compilation
[10:36:54] <Urchlay> ventYl: distcc took some slight messing with, my big box is 64-bit, have to use multilib and have distcc run /usr/bin/32/gcc
[10:37:13] <Urchlay> can it? it used to only do compilation (that's all I'm doing with it)
[10:37:43] <ventYl> Urchlay: yes it can but you have to have exactly identical includes and whole build system
[10:38:00] <ventYl> only linking phase is performed by "master" machine i thing
[10:38:02] <ventYl> think
[10:38:09] <Urchlay> that's not likely to work, if one box is slackare32 and the other's slackware64+multilib
[10:38:39] <wood_quinn> And seems like more of a pain than it'd be worth for occassional builds.
[10:38:40] <ruskie> I thought the only thing for distcc was to have the same gcc major.minor versions on both systems
[10:38:55] <Urchlay> is OK, what I've got now works (except when cmake "helpfully" decides my compiler is really /usr/bin/gcc even though /usr/local/bin/gcc appears in $PATH first!)
[10:39:00] <ruskie> everything else is handled by the system running the compile
[10:39:11] <ventYl> with huge amount of configuration it should work
[10:39:51] <Urchlay> ruskie: yes, except my real /usr/bin/gcc on the 64bit box, needs -m32 added to the command line to make it spit out 32-bit code. Which is what /usr/bin/32/gcc is (a script that runs /usr/bin/gcc -m32 "$@*)

[10:43:35] <wood_quinn> The six-day challenge.
[10:43:42] <Urchlay> ventYl: ccache can't be used on the slave nodes anyway (according to the distcc docs). Only the master uses it (anything in the cache, never gets passed to distcc in the first place)
[10:43:44] <ventYl> ruskie: for regular distcc that's true. but with regular distcc trully distributed is only compilation. remote machine reads preprocessed source from master and writes compiled assembly back. it means that linking is bottleneck
[10:43:52] <ventYl> erm... preprocessing
[10:43:53] <KaMii> Je ne crois pas
[10:44:38] <Urchlay> KaMii: does that mean "I an not a croissant"?

[12:33:05] <tmc2> complicated build systems only make things harder :(
[12:33:06] <ruskie> the problem of everything not autotools is that it focuses on the developer not the user of the tool

[15:13:57] <tmc2> well actually that isn't to be expected

[15:15:50] <eviljames> easily.  you set the quality to be extremely high on AC3
[15:16:15] <eviljames> Hell, you could have a FLAC that doesn't contain a lot of data, and transcode it to a point where you're trying to increase resolution (high-bitrate AC3) and likely end up with a larger ac3 than flac
[15:16:27] <tmc2> hmm, well guess it probably isn't optimised for that, so would sound worse
[15:16:58] <tmc2> right
[15:17:10] <eviljames> There's a lot of variability when it comes to A/V data - so to get good answers to questions like that you've got to examine a number of factors

[15:43:20] <eviljames> you gotta hate a piece of software a lot to make your nick that it sucks.. especially when it doesn't suck.
[15:43:34] <eviljames> Demon_Fox: Why would you assume that?
[15:43:58] <eviljames> FLAC is not a codec designed for efficient storage.
[15:44:35] <Skywise> flac saves space over wav files
[15:44:50] <eviljames> over uncompressed pcm data, that's not exactly an achievement.
[15:45:20] <Cultist> eviljames, it kinda is
[15:45:21] <d4wnr4z0r> it is when you have a lot of wavs.
[15:45:31] <d4wnr4z0r> "everything counts in large amounts"
[15:45:54] <Cultist> flac is used for audio storage more than any other format, thanks to its outstanding lossless file sizes
[15:46:08] <Cultist> for archive storage, I should say
[15:46:24] <Cultist> or general listening for people who download nothing but flac
[15:46:25] <eviljames> I was going to say, if you think flac is more widely used than mp3, then I'm not the one on drugs this morning ;)
[15:46:40] <d4wnr4z0r> you're on drugs this morning?
[15:46:44] <eviljames> Who isn't?
[15:46:52] <eviljames> Wait... am I the only one who drops acid before 8am?
[15:47:04] <Cultist> You can get nearly full transparency at 320 or even v0 mp3
[15:47:12] <Cultist> but it's just not the same
[15:47:22] <eviljames> Yes it is, your ears are lying to you.
[15:47:31] <eviljames> or rather, your brain is misinterpreting the data it gets from its ears.
[15:47:35] <Cultist> no
[15:47:37] <d4wnr4z0r> your ears are on acid.
[15:47:43] <Cultist> flac can be transcoded an unlimited number of times
[15:47:46] <Cultist> to any size of mp3
[15:48:02] <Cultist> but if you try to go from one mp3 to anything else, the quality loss is perceptible from the very first
[15:48:03] <eviljames> the average listener can't tell the difference between 128k mp3, and a CD.  Trained listeners usually can't tell the diff between 192k and 256k mp3 (they just think they can)
[15:48:34] <eviljames> Truly, your ears are lying to you.  That extra audio resolution is really important for mixing/mastering and al that - but it truly isn't in general listening scenarios.
[15:48:46] <d4wnr4z0r> I've always been able to identify 128k encoded mp3s by sound.

[15:49:18] <Skywise> the real difference in bitrates show up in the details
[15:49:19] <d4wnr4z0r> and they have funny sounds. often the drums sound funny.
[15:49:33] <Skywise> like how clear the cymbals ring and fade
[15:49:57] <Skywise> you also get better separation of the instruments at a higher bitrate
[15:50:09] <Skywise> so you can tell its 2 guitars instead of just one playing a cool note
[15:50:36] <d4wnr4z0r> I VBR all the things. sounds good to me.

[15:50:52] <Cultist> I've noticed in a few different instances in music with clear vocals, lower bitrates tend to remove the breathing of the singer
[15:51:07] <Cultist> at v0 or 320 or flac, you clearly get the inhalation
[15:51:22] <eviljames> yeah, that's not surprising either.  like d4wnr4z0r and Skywise said, it's all about the details.

[15:51:31] <Skywise> they all play sounds that are recognizeable, but i think what it boils down to are the finer aspects
[15:51:40] <eviljames> but if you don't have the ears or equipment to hear/reproduce those details it doesn't matter anyway.
[15:52:11] <eviljames> "flac sounds better in my earbuds" - not better than a 192k mp3, it doesn't.  People just think it does because they get satisfaction frrom the knowledge that they're using a superior codec.
[15:52:19] <Cultist> I keep flac, but not because I can notice the difference (v0 sounds quite the same to me in most, but not all, cases)
[15:52:40] <eviljames> that is, unless you've got some really good earbuds (like etymotics)
[15:52:50] <Skywise> i keep flac cause space is cheap and i prefer its quality
[15:52:56] <Cultist> I keep it because 1, I can, 2, if mp3 is superseded in popularity I can move to the next big thing without loss of quality
[15:53:08] <wizbit> my collection is flac, and i transcode into different formats for different devices
[15:53:15] <Skywise> but i also have mp3, cause thats what my head unit can play
[15:53:20] <Cultist> I use a pair of AKG Q701s with an amp and USB dac
[15:53:32] <Cultist> quality difference is a lot more noticable with decent cans I have to say
[15:53:40] <Cultist> when there is a difference to be noticed.
[15:53:51] <eviljames> Cultist: oh yea, definitely.  Those are a great set of cans
[15:54:02] <eviljames> Cultist: That's a speaker that usually can reproduce tones accurately.

[16:02:46] <d4wnr4z0r> the reverse is also true.
[16:03:05] <Skywise> speakers are pretty simple devices
[16:03:08] <Cultist> if anything, good speakers will make a bad signal worse
[16:03:28] <Strum> yeah
[16:03:31] <Skywise> i don't see how that happens

[16:03:45] <Strum> good speakers will show up every flaw and imblance in a mix
[16:03:57] <d4wnr4z0r> the volume wars have proven that good speakers can make a bad signal sound like shit.
[16:04:28] <Skywise> everything is mixed too loud these days anyway
[16:04:40] <Strum> wrong again
[16:04:44] <Skywise> no
[16:04:49] <d4wnr4z0r> yes.
[16:04:51] <d4wnr4z0r> it's the compression.
[16:04:52] Action: BrokenCog likes the buzz hiss and pop on ghetto cars blasting 2,495 watt speakers.
[16:05:15] <Skywise> its a common complaint from sound engineers cause the labels want their songs to be louder then the rest
[16:05:18] <Demon_Fox> eviljames, I was told there is another lossless codec that gets files smaller than flac on average
[16:05:20] <Strum> there has been a major backlash against the volume wars and people are not using maximing to the hard limit like there were mid-late 90s
[16:05:31] <Skywise> i haven't heard it
[16:05:40] <Cultist> Demon_Fox, what codec?
[16:05:45] <Strum> probably cos you listen to stupid commercial shite
[16:05:48] <Skywise> there may be a few, but they're prolly not using autotune either
[16:05:55] <Skywise> wrong
[16:05:56] <Cultist> only one that even would come close is ALAC, and no one but a mac junkie would touch an alac
[16:06:15] <Cultist> maybe APE
[16:06:20] <Skywise> i prefer jazz myself
[16:06:37] <Skywise> is there a version of vlc that can play ape correctly?
[16:06:52] <Cultist> I've never tried
[16:07:05] <Skywise> its a long standing bug
[16:07:07] <smed> Skywise - ;)
[16:07:09] <Cultist> ape is closed source as far as I know though, so that could cause trouble

[16:21:50] Action: Demon_Fox is just guessing at how it could hold a possible truth
[16:22:19] <Cultist> well if the codec is specifically geared at a certain aspect of audio, it's certainly possible
[16:22:36] <Cultist> like a codec just for speech recording or something could be optimised
[16:22:50] <Demon_Fox> That is what I am thinking
[16:23:11] <Demon_Fox> Like perhaps for everything but speech its files are a lot larger than flac
[16:24:20] <Demon_Fox> It could be that the author tested with only speech files and found that.
[16:24:33] <Demon_Fox> Then jumped to a conclusion, maybe/
[16:24:47] <Demon_Fox> Cultist, In which case I wish I would have remembered the format

[17:50:43] <dive> zvacet, also slackware doesn't handle dependencies, you do. It doesn't know about package dependency at all.
[17:50:54] <zvacet> zvacet: just have quick look on ffmpeg I don´t know if I want to go all over again
[17:50:55] <dive> It's left for the admin to do.

[17:52:43] <zvacet> dive: pavucontrol need pulseaudio
[17:52:53] <dive> well *apart* from that
[17:52:58] <Skywise> automated dependency management can be a tangle
[17:53:45] <zvacet> Skywise: I know there is a reason for slackware way of doing things but I´m not use to it that is all
[17:53:47] <Skywise> because everything that depends on a libary, might not be able to use a new version while others can
[17:54:12] <dive> zvacet, don't worry. All will become clear ;)
[17:54:43] <zvacet> dive: it is clear that is time consuming to install one package  ;)
[17:54:58] <Skywise> yeah, it will become clear, cause if it don't it won't work
[17:55:09] <dive> It can be, but luckily they aren't all like that.

[23:51:32] <DarthEaron> Which is better for trying to run Netflix queue or virtual box

[23:51:54] <eviljames> what's queue?
[23:52:08] <DarthEaron> **qemu-KVM not queue
[23:52:35] <eviljames> oh, they're going to be pretty comparable.  VirtualBox has extra graphics goodies
[23:52:50] <eviljames> I don't think either will be very good - but someone who's actually done this might be able to tell you better than I would.
[23:53:15] <FLYSWATER> can I run fsck while in X?
[23:53:41] <DarthEaron> I can run Netflix but not reliably under virtual box. I have never tried the other one
[23:57:12] <eviljames> FLYSWATER: Depends if your filesystem supports online fsck
[23:57:13] <macavity> FLYSWATER: why is it that it looks like your name YELLS itself at me everytime i look at it? :P

[23:58:15] <Skywise> you can't run fsck on a mounted filesystem
[23:58:18] <andarius_> Salutations and waffles
[23:58:37] <FLYSWATER> AH the wise of skys and penny speaks what is needed to be said.
[23:58:39] <FLYSWATER> Thank you

[23:58:42] <NyteOwl> Felicitations and maple syrup
