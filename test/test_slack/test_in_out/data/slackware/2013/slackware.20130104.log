[00:00:31] <Skywise> that doesn't make sense, but it seems like you're missing include files
[00:02:04] <Skywise> so you would need to see what file it was trying to include, where that file is on your system, then add it to the include path as a command line option or add it to the makefile

[00:37:43] <jgeboski> yes
[00:38:01] <TommyC> What are they for, and why? It seems Slackware has some of them as packages on the system. :/
[00:38:33] <jgeboski> some of them won't work, such as clucene
[00:38:40] <jgeboski> there is also an issue with poppler
[00:38:48] <jgeboski> but, others are not needed
[00:39:00] <TommyC> So are those dependencies for libreoffice?
[00:39:20] <jgeboski> my script uses the bundled scripts
[00:39:26] <TommyC> right, autogen.sh

[00:39:50] <jgeboski> that's actually what does the downloading
[00:40:30] <TommyC> ah "make fetch"
[00:40:35] <jgeboski> yea
[00:40:46] <jgeboski> I believe it is in `all` target as well
[00:41:03] <jgeboski> but, I did it explicitly so I know in the future
[00:41:08] <TommyC> Does it need to actually fetch all the tarballs, and does libreoffice actually need them all?
[00:41:14] <jgeboski> granted, a comment would have also been acceptable
[00:41:32] <jgeboski> yes, it fetches them *all*, and it does not need all of them

[04:05:02] <shonudo> ah, doing things
[04:05:05] <shonudo> so he must like things
[04:05:35] <KaMii> or hes become a slave to things
[04:05:44] <shonudo> that can happen too
[04:05:56] <KaMii> in soviet russia, things do you

[04:06:26] <shonudo> movies*
[04:06:34] <shonudo> there were many things in the 1950s
[04:06:48] <KaMii> i always get that movie cornfuses with the blob
[04:08:00] <shonudo> the blob and the thing were two completely different characters
[04:08:07] <shonudo> there's more pathos in the thing
[04:08:16] <shonudo> the blob is much more ambiguous
[04:08:29] <shonudo> and the thing is looking for resolution
[04:08:34] <shonudo> the blob is...
[04:08:38] <shonudo> well, just a blob
[04:09:00] <TommyC> An acidic titan of digestion, aka the blob.
[04:09:09] <shonudo> you know, after greek drama, nothing beats the sci-fi of the 1950s

[04:40:12] <wed> No, in a book shelf
[04:40:29] <wed> THAT is on the floor though
[04:40:41] <Skywise> bookcases are best on the floor
[04:40:56] <Skywise> they don't stay on the ceiling very long
[04:41:10] <shonudo> hmmm, a new game: six degrees of floor
[04:41:39] <wed> But my shelf reach the ceiling
[04:41:44] <wed> I built it
[04:42:53] <shonudo> did kevin bacon help you build it?
[04:42:58] <shonudo> (just checking)

[04:46:13] <shonudo> kevin bacon is in a lot of movies with wooden things
[04:46:26] <wed> What's this obsession with Kevin Bacon?
[04:46:39] <Skywise> i'm sure he's built a book case in at least one of his movies
[04:46:52] <shonudo> or was standing in front of a bookcase
[04:47:01] <shonudo> or said "bookcase" in one of his lines
[04:47:08] <wed> He probably wouldn't get his lumber at the same place I did

[04:48:20] <shonudo> cause now i'm suspicious
[04:48:25] <wed> I have the receipts
[04:48:33] <Skywise> it might of just been someone who looked like kevin bacon, come to think of it
[04:48:34] <shonudo> these sorts of things aren't coincidences, you know
[04:49:12] <Skywise> or maybe kevin bacon needed a lawyer
[04:49:34] <wed> He would be hard pressed to get help in Sweden for that
[04:49:47] <shonudo> no lawyers in sweden?
[04:49:53] <shonudo> hard to believe
[04:50:06] <wed> We have a few. but they are not polluting the market here
[04:50:16] <shonudo> a few... as in three?
[04:50:17] <Skywise> do they use norweigan wood in sweden
[04:50:37] <Skywise> or do they prefer scandanavian wood
[04:50:39] <shonudo> which is a beatles song
[04:51:00] <shonudo> which kevin bacon listened to, before going on the set of footloose
[04:51:18] <shonudo> or foot loose
[04:51:22] <Skywise> does finland have their own wood or do they just take swedens
[04:51:45] <shonudo> if there were more lawyers in sweden, that sort of thing wouldn't happen
[04:51:54] <wed> They have some trees of their own
[04:52:19] <Skywise> but you never hear about finnish wood
[04:52:30] <Skywise> wood finish is all over the place
[04:52:34] <wed> Why not?

[05:02:56] <Skywise> he could make a stack
[05:03:12] <pi31415> i was thinking about trying zimbra in the office and citadel at home
[05:03:28] <pi31415> shonudo, i haven't decided what to do with them yet
[05:03:55] <pi31415> shonudo, i am thinking of making a slackware derivative linux distribution, and they would make good test boxes
[05:03:58] <Skywise> even tho they're outclassed by a rpi and take up a big footprint, and you'd need  kvm for them
[05:04:23] <shonudo> raspi crossed my mind as a comparative, i have to admit
[05:04:32] <shonudo> test boxes is good
[05:04:51] <shonudo> how much ram came with those things?
[05:05:02] <Skywise> i would set them up and give them to a needy friend with low standards or schools or something
[05:05:06] <pi31415> some have 256mb, others 512mb
[05:05:18] <Skywise> yeah, you're not winning any contests with those
[05:05:21] <pi31415> i think they are old enough to use sdram, and I think I have some spare
[05:05:43] <shonudo> what's the capacity on the mobos?
[05:05:50] <pi31415> Skywise, they would run puppy fine
[05:05:54] <pi31415> shonudo, dunno yet
[05:06:30] <shonudo> turn one into a router
[05:06:39] <shonudo> turn another into a snort box
[05:06:47] <shonudo> don't know what to do with the rest
[05:06:59] <Skywise> they'll prolly last forever if they haven't died by now
[05:07:11] <shonudo> indeed
[05:08:17] <pi31415> it brings to mind the question of minimum requirements for a computer to be worthwhile
[05:08:46] <shonudo> you're well within the minimum; you could put them to some use
[05:08:48] <shonudo> not much
[05:08:49] <pi31415> i am fat and lazy, for me it would be PCI slots.  if it is older than PCI, then it's too old.
[05:08:50] <shonudo> but some
[05:09:06] <Skywise> its gotta be able to surf, play mp3s and maybe watch some videos, hd not required
[05:10:08] <pi31415> with a PCI slot you could plug in a USB controller and get access to modern peripherals

[06:07:33] <shonudo> the keyboard i'm on right now may be one of my all-time favorites (just after the old ibm keyboards)
[06:07:34] <Skywise> i can't really get psyched up about a keyboard
[06:07:38] <Skywise> even if it had lights
[06:07:42] <shonudo> and i guess these are going
[06:07:56] <Skywise> not even blinken lights
[06:08:00] <shonudo> the thinkpad keyboards are good
[06:08:16] <shonudo> the old ibm "clacky" or whatever keyboards are great
[06:08:24] <shonudo> backlight keyboards are bs

[06:10:56] <shonudo> i don't even get how that's a point-of-sale come on
[06:11:08] <shonudo> "and the keys are backlit!"
[06:11:24] <shonudo> and the response is, "so? what does that do?"
[06:12:17] <Skywise> lets you type when the power is out
[06:12:30] <shonudo> lol
[06:12:33] <shonudo> nice
[06:14:04] <shonudo> that was a best buy salesperson response
[06:14:32] <shonudo> wonder how long before they're out of business, come to think of it
[06:16:04] <Skywise> you mean they're not?
[06:17:11] <shonudo> not yet
[06:17:17] <shonudo> still limping along
[06:17:29] <shonudo> i'll bet 2013 is their last year
[06:17:37] <shonudo> (not joking)
[06:17:54] <Skywise> its just such a cynical organization
[06:17:59] <Skywise> even its name is ironic
[06:20:09] <shonudo> the last one i walked into recently (a couple of months now) was noticeably understocked
[06:20:28] <shonudo> i doubt they can last under the current model
[06:20:41] <shonudo> maybe they'll end up as an online company
[06:20:50] <Skywise> yeah, last one i was in cat6e patch cables were like unicorn teeth
[06:21:20] <Skywise> i figured they hadn't heard of them yet
[06:21:39] <shonudo> go to a store twice and not find what you want, you won't be back
[06:22:06] <Skywise> the nice thing about best buy is you can check online before you decide not to go
[06:22:16] <shonudo> i'm more likely to go to a mom&pop computer shop for stuff these days
[06:22:32] <Skywise> wouldn't know where to find one around here
[06:22:58] <Skywise> aren't really any kind of computer stores around here
[06:23:11] <Skywise> its best buy, office depot and staples
[06:23:20] <Skywise> so i usually order from newegg
[06:23:54] <shonudo> i used to go to best buy to look at the stuff i was going to order from newegg :P
[06:24:02] <shonudo> they're not even good for that anymore

[17:31:00] <Zordrak> Yeah.. sure.. a Slack question in #nx, they'll love that
[17:31:30] <Zordrak> Where did all the people I know go.
[17:31:32] <thumbs> how do you know it's a slackware issue, and not a freenx configuration issue?
[17:31:39] <Zordrak> heey
[17:32:48] <Zordrak> Because last time I tried freenx from SBo on 13.37 it worked out of the box. Given that nx is written for non-slack, there are occasionally caveats, such as commenting out the line in the default slack sshd file that restricts the authorized key file to authorized_keys not aithorized_keys2
[17:33:12] <Zordrak> And I wanted to know if there was some simple key thing I had missed that is required, but for some reason not mentioned in the SBo README
[17:33:29] <Zordrak> Because I can see no clear reason why this would not work as simply as it had done before

[17:47:17] <Zordrak> iirc kd4 & conky dont play well

[17:47:39] <KaMii> mine will not work becauae it says own_window_type override

[18:02:08] Action: BrokenCog thinks the purpose of the spam ban is to prevent the never ending trite chat which follows ... wonders when people will start _ignoring_ the poster, and _call_ for an op to kick them ... rather than waste a screen full humoring the poster - who really has nothing else better to do and _wants_ the attention.
[18:02:22] <TheM4ch1n3> everyone pm Dominian asking for cash$$$ !!! NOW!!

[18:32:15] <KaMii> literature is like religion and politics, everyone has a favorite and a side, and it should not be forced on others
[18:32:26] <BrokenCog> okay. I really am leaving.  bye, happy lit bashing.
[18:32:33] <nofra> Lit sucks
[18:32:43] <KaMii> he must have been a lit major in univeristy
[18:32:57] <BrokenCog> KaMii: ah, you missed the point - lit does have opnions - the point is to HAVE them by READING it not dismissing it.
[18:33:03] <BrokenCog> okay. I really am leaving.  bye, happy lit bashing.

[18:35:49] <KaMii> selma lagerlof sounds very familiar
[18:36:19] <ttkay> my theory is that the value of lit is similar to the value of travel -- it exposes people to new ideas, philosophies, values, and ways of life.  But also like travel it has become rather obsolete in the face of the internet, which allows people easy access to ideas and people from around the globe.
[18:36:21] <BrokenCog>  first female writer to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, and most widely known for her children's book
[18:36:41] <KaMii> yea, thats wright, because i have a pictures on the wall by her
[18:36:57] <KaMii> and i was confused for a minute, because i was like, isnt she an artist, im looking at one of her pictures
[18:37:10] <ttkay> It may not be a particularly *good* substitute for lit or travel, but it's certainly easier for people to use, and in small doses.

[18:41:12] <BrokenCog> I like lots written today - I just don't dismiss a thing because it's "classic" "new" "different" ... or whatever.

[18:41:57] <KaMii> i dont hate all the classics, i just dont like some of the crap i have read, and im like, how is this a classic?  whats classic about it, is we havent burned all copies of it
[18:42:31] <Skywise> yeah, academic literature standards are phony
[18:42:54] <Skywise> its always a case its great cause all these other people though so
[18:42:55] <KaMii> because pleasure reading is wrong
[18:43:03] <KaMii> if you enjoy the story, then its not work
[18:43:14] <KaMii> and they just want you to work and be miserable
[18:43:22] <Skywise> the reality is, if they didn't go thru such convoluted extremes, they'd have nothing to teach
[18:43:46] <BrokenCog> I think, perhaps, when reading something *someone else* says is important, the hard part is to try and figure out *why* they think that - then read it with that point in mind.  rather than "fuck another assignment"
[18:43:55] <Skywise> they make it seem difficult so as to disguise the nothingness there
[18:44:11] <Skywise> its all a matter of taste, there aren't any objective classifications
[18:44:12] <KaMii> BrokenCog: exactly, so explain how shakespear is important,
[18:44:28] <Skywise> shakespeare was the jerry springer of his day
[18:44:30] <KaMii> at least update the translation so people can understand what the fuck is being said
[18:44:30] <BrokenCog> really?
[18:44:44] <gnisho> o.O
[18:44:47] <AtomPhil> haha
[18:44:50] <Skywise> yes, his plays were baudy and raunchy for the times
[18:44:52] <nofra> I like Shakespeare BECAUSE of the wording

[18:45:26] <nofra> yea
[18:45:27] <AtomPhil> *dost
[18:45:27] <gnisho> Shakespeare hard to read?  really?
[18:45:29] <Skywise> shakespeare would not of been considered sophisticated in his time
[18:45:40] <ttkay> shakespear provides insight into wordsmithing, history, and power politics, all in one package
[18:45:47] <BrokenCog> not jerry spirnger, he has trivia as violence, rather Shakespeare was more ... hmm .. more of a long format John Stewart
[18:45:48] <KaMii> shakespear was an illiterate
[18:46:01] <nofra> No, he could read
[18:46:02] <AtomPhil> ...definitely not
[18:46:05] <Skywise> wordsmithing, thats a understatement
[18:46:18] <KaMii> well, i dont understand hinm
[18:46:21] <Skywise> cervantes made up alot of the words his works too
[18:46:22] <KaMii> so its wasted on me
[18:46:36] <KaMii> update the language to modern day english and I might give it a try
[18:46:40] <Skywise> its just fashion
[18:46:48] <BrokenCog> today's shakespeare is actually more likely Movie Directors.  that is our current go to format for storytelling.
[18:46:52] <AtomPhil> KaMii: is English your first language?
[18:46:57] <ttkay> KaMii, the point of studying it is to transition from a state of not understanding him, to a state of understanding him, and thereby becoming a more knowledgable, understanding, and powerful person.
[18:47:11] <BrokenCog> and storytelling is how we (humans) school each other and how to live, what to think, how to act, etc.
[18:47:17] <KaMii> ttkay: than i doubt anyone can agree what hes saying then
[18:47:29] <Skywise> its like whats her face, just famous for being famous, those works are popular just for being popular and then somewhere along the way some academic declared them classics and worth study and here we are
[18:47:37] <BrokenCog> AtomPhil: I think hatred of anything is KaMii's first language.
[18:47:40] <ttkay> Like mathematics, it will pay off later in life, because you will understand more of what is going on in the world around you, and have more powerful personal tools for expressing complex ideas.
[18:47:45] <Skywise> kardashian or whatever
[18:47:50] <KaMii> BrokenCog: seriosly?

[18:48:16] <nofra> Why you bustin her?
[18:48:32] <AtomPhil> BrokenCog: I'm just interested cause I guess you'd miss a lot even if you're a fluent English speaker
[18:48:33] <KaMii> because im young and hes an old lit major
[18:48:35] <BrokenCog> Skywise: no.  The stories of Shakespeare have meaning, lessons, and value regardless of what an academic says.
[18:48:50] <BrokenCog> AtomPhil: He's been translated a bit.
[18:49:10] <ttkay> heh
[18:49:24] <KaMii> well, to someone that doesnt have a strong english language skill, shakespear is impossible to understand
[18:49:38] <BrokenCog> Skywise: think of any "good" movie - did you learn something?  did an academic need to tell you that? but, if you take a film class one will tell you that that film has lessons.
[18:49:45] <KaMii> it takes me about an hour to figure out each sentence, I dont have time for that
[18:49:48] <BrokenCog> KaMii: read the translations.
[18:49:56] Nick change: Guest63120 -> wood_quinn

[19:15:41] <Crosma> I have a pretty good success rate with Wine to be honest.
[19:16:04] <Skywise> well,ati isn't known for its driver prowess

[19:16:39] <Crosma> Aren't ATi going to be dead now that AMD is tanking?
[19:16:58] <Skywise> i think they'll be fine
[19:16:59] <ttkay> never needed wine, and haven't needed multilibs for years
[19:17:21] <nofra> ATI probably would be sold off
[19:17:42] <BrokenCog> AMD will be fine.  one bad product doesn't ruin a company.  Look at Windows98, ME, Vista, 8, Phone ...

[19:18:31] <nofra> BrokenCog: It's more than one bad product

[19:19:17] <nofra> Yeah, THAT is what all the analysts have been griping about

[19:19:39] <nofra> They cut R&D to save money short term and it's killing them now
[19:19:43] <BrokenCog> KaMii: that is what we, in English, call "redundant."  Shakespeare was great at making fun of that.
[19:20:00] <Skywise> i wish amd and nvidia had gotten together
[19:20:02] <KaMii> and back to shakespear
[19:20:06] <BrokenCog> nofra: It would.  well, I hope they keep going.
[19:20:10] <Skywise> that would of been so awesome, but ati sucks

[19:21:30] <nofra> Skywise: Wha?
[19:21:42] <nofra> Who's 2nd best?
[19:21:42] <Skywise> ati was the worst choice for amd
[19:21:48] <Skywise> there is no 2nd

[19:21:56] <nofra> Skywise: Better ATI than Trident

[19:24:21] <rachael> tseng where good when we only needed 2d
[19:24:47] <Crosma> Well, nVidia have been at the top the entire time, yeah
[19:24:51] <ttkay> I hadn't heard about AMD slashing their R&D team.  Sucks (and stupid), if true.
[19:24:52] <Skywise> but no one was doing simultaneous pixel processing
[19:25:43] <Skywise> i think amd's problem is they don't know how to move forward
[19:25:47] <ttkay> Buying up the DEC Alpha R&D folks was one of the best moves they ever pulled.  It took them out of the also-rans and made them a genuine competitor for Intel for top-of-the-line processors.

[19:51:19] <KaMii> wasnt that jackass
[19:51:22] <eviljames> Then MTV got wind of this and ruined it into Jackass the TV show, and further with the stupid movies.

[21:01:32] Action: TheM4ch1n3 is running the Oracle built latest binary with minimal issues
[21:01:48] Action: TheM4ch1n3 doesn't mind it crashing my kernel once in a while
[21:01:51] <BrokenCog> I was just starting to download it from oracle ...
[21:03:37] <TheM4ch1n3> I haven't had time to try the SBo version yet
[21:03:41] <TheM4ch1n3> but I hear its more stable
[21:04:11] <BrokenCog> maybe if it installs :).  since I can't get that intel compiler to compile/intsall, the SBo isn't going anywhere.
[21:04:59] <BrokenCog> it would be nice having a native build, but I don't think it's going to be a noticeable performance issue.  not for my use anyway.
[21:05:21] <TheM4ch1n3> well if you don't mind not having GPU support, I use Qemu
[21:05:42] <TheM4ch1n3> or Virt-manager (too many deps, so not installed on v14.0 here yet ...)
[21:05:55] <BrokenCog> I'ven never used Qemu ... is it nicer than VBox?
[21:06:09] <TheM4ch1n3> well its slower, and more stable ...
[21:06:18] <BrokenCog> and no GPU supprotr?
[21:06:25] <TheM4ch1n3> it doesn't allow you to run minecraft in it, so I would say, 50/50
[21:06:42] <TheM4ch1n3> either , or ,,, depending what you need 'the other os' for
[21:06:59] <eviljames> qemu is slower than vbox?

[22:11:56] <pi31415> i've read old books where "outhouse" meant anything other than the main house
[22:12:03] <pi31415> they'd call a guest house an outhouse

[22:12:41] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[22:13:03] <pi31415> sounds sanitary!
[22:13:08] <ttkay> and "outhouse" is understood to refer to a tiny building containing a toilet and nothing else

[22:25:08] <wood_quinn> Is there value in ethernet to fiber? Like extending the range?
[22:25:22] <wood_quinn> Obviously it'd be bottlenecked right?
[22:25:27] <Skaperen> ttkay: fiber optic converters
[22:25:30] <ttkay> thanks
[22:25:46] <Skaperen> they make them in 10m, 100m, and 1000m speeds
[22:26:00] <Skaperen> I think there are also PoE ones, too
[22:26:26] <SeKtA> WDM one is for 1 fiber cord bidirectional

[22:28:08] <Skaperen> ttkay: what actually goes over the fiber for those may not be the same as if you used direct fiber ported routers and such
[22:28:41] <Skaperen> ttkay: they make them for all kinds of stuff, analog and digital ... I saw HDMI-to-fiber ones, for example
[22:29:02] <Skaperen> ttkay: there are USB ones, too
[22:29:17] <ttkay> 550 meter range limit, looks like, which is plenty for me (the shed's only about fifteen feet away)
[22:29:27] <wood_quinn> Wow. That's pretty impressive.
[22:29:29] <Skaperen> and I saw one for pro-audio XLR type microphone connections
[22:29:59] <ttkay> Skaperen -- good point.  If need be I can just get two, and use ordinary copper switches at the endpoints.
[22:30:01] <Skaperen> the long range ones are more expensive ... hundreds of $$$
[22:30:01] <wood_quinn> I don't remember ethernet's range formula, but IIRC it's not that.
[22:30:24] <ttkay> Metro Ethernet has screwed up the formula big time
[22:30:27] <wood_quinn> So that's very cool.
[22:30:29] <Skaperen> ttkay: yeah, that would be the easy way to go
[22:30:49] <ttkay> there are "ethernet" networks spanning 20+ miles
[22:31:23] <Skaperen> ham radio operators have done "ethernet" over 250+ miles via radio
[22:31:42] <eviljames> What's the latency?
[22:31:51] <Skaperen> the timing issues with ethernet don't apply the same way for point to point
[22:33:15] <Skaperen> the timing is only a collision avoidance thing ... do point to point and there's no issue
[22:33:57] <wood_quinn> Skaperen: What do you mean?
[22:34:13] <pi31415> "Mant consumers now rely on Metro Wireless in areas where local telephone companies and cable companies do not or will no longer service due to copper theft or other business reasons."
[22:34:17] <pi31415> Internet ghetto
[22:35:25] <ttkay> it looks like 100 microseconds is the magic threshold latency for bragging rights in the metro ethernet world
[22:36:18] <wood_quinn> microseconds?
[22:37:08] <Skaperen> ttkey: for internet access, that's actually kinda high
[22:37:30] <ttkay> .. which is the time it takes light to travel 30km, so doing much better is speed-of-light limited
[22:37:48] <wood_quinn> No, 100 millseconds is braggable.
[22:38:29] <wood_quinn> microseconds are millionths of a second. I doubt many people have internet with that kind of latency.
[22:38:52] <wood_quinn> To my router I get 4.37 ms.
[22:39:07] <pi31415> give me microsecend latency, or give me lag
[22:39:18] <ttkay> well, metro ethernet is for backhaul, not for bringing network to the home

[23:37:09] <wood_quinn> Oh no one will go to jail.
[23:37:29] <wood_quinn> At least no one rich and powerful (and by nature able to do it again.)
[23:39:46] <TommyC> FreeDOS is a pretty nifty.
[23:41:31] <ttkay> heh :-) I did FreeDOS for a couple of years, before dosbox worked for 64-bit
[23:42:06] <ttkay> it worked quite well
[23:42:35] <ttkay> but running dosbox, and thus avoiding reboot, works even better

[23:48:03] <TommyC> ttkay: Can DOSBox be used for BIOS flashing?
[23:48:32] <ttkay> I don't know, TommyC.
[23:48:59] <TommyC> Wanna try it? ;)
[23:49:17] <wood_quinn> Why wouldn't DOSBox work?
[23:50:37] <TommyC> I'm wondering if it does work.
[23:50:42] Haldrik (~haldrik@unaffiliated/haldrik) left irc: Quit: Haldrik
[23:50:44] <ananke> because it's an emulator
[23:50:44] <wood_quinn> It should.
[23:51:25] <wood_quinn> I guess not.
[23:51:46] <TommyC> I know FreeDOS works because I've done it with FreeDOS, and that's an entire OS.
[23:52:28] <ttkay> a few minutes of googling around suggests it wouldn't work from dosbox.
[23:52:59] <TommyC> Ah, forgot about Google. :/
[23:53:32] <TommyC> Thanks ttkay.
