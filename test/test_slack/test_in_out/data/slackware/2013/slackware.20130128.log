[02:48:41] <n1x4> Guess I'll play with it some... Gimmie time to kill while my d/l finishes
[02:50:27] <Skaperen> is HTML5 official, yet?

[02:50:48] <Urchlay> (which works better than you might think actually)
[02:51:01] <KaMii> maybe thats why your not crashing?

[03:08:09] <n1x4> I'd say browser, media player/viewr, text editor netwoking toools
[03:08:12] <Urchlay> mail reader. RSS aggregator or whatever the name is
[03:08:40] <darwin_> in KDE4, I changed the working path of an XMMS quick-launch icon to my music folder, and XMMS disappeared from both there and my KDE start menu
[03:08:40] <rennj> my ramos is 227MB on boot, squashfs/zlib not lzma but vmplayer,chrome,mplayer and couple of small utils
[03:08:51] <rennj> chrome views pdfs
[03:09:02] <Urchlay> ugh, not gonna even attempt to get chrome working without X
[03:09:09] <n1x4> lololol
[03:09:22] <rennj> i got list of slack pkg i did if you want me to post..13.37

[03:09:23] <thumbs> Urchlay: you'd be quite bonkers if you tried that.
[03:09:25] <Urchlay> (is there even a chance? can I get the source? or is only chromium's source available?)
[03:09:33] <n1x4> don't see a need for any RSS really
[03:09:43] <n1x4> chromium only
[03:09:45] <rennj> for bare min..but i removed all the man pages, and html and stripped vmplayer down a little
[03:09:52] <Urchlay> me either. But I'm trying to think of the things people use (people who aren't necessarily me)
[03:10:08] <n1x4> True
[03:10:22] <rennj> slax linux is small and nice..
[03:10:39] <n1x4> Well if you're goin for that demographic just make sure you can play farmville :P
[03:11:06] <Urchlay> right now, I can mix & match qt4, directfb, and gtk apps... but they don't play well together (can't copy/paste between the 3 different types, and window management is... weird)
[03:11:36] <Urchlay> and most gtk apps I've successfully built, don't work worth a damn (evince is OK)
[03:12:17] <Urchlay> if I limit myself to only qt, I don't have to load up directfb (saves ram, plus directfb is kinda crashy so far)

[03:12:48] <Urchlay> (me, I'm happy with CLI mplayer)
[03:12:54] <n1x4> ^
[03:13:30] <n1x4> i use mplayer all the time, works great
[03:13:41] <Urchlay> right now plain mplayer doesn't play well with other framebuffer apps though. It writes directly to the video ram, without the other apps knowing about it
[03:13:42] <rennj> http://pastebin.com/1PRafTQ1 Urchlay
[03:14:01] <Urchlay> it does *work* but you get display weirdness if the other apps decide to redraw themselves
[03:14:12] <darwin_> I like OCP best
[03:14:18] <darwin_> but it does not do 'net radio
[03:14:21] <rennj> that like a 650MB /root fs before squashfs/zlib it down
[03:14:29] <Urchlay> rennj: not bad
[03:14:30] <darwin_> nor run in graphics mode in an xterm
[03:14:44] <rennj> vmplayer 4.x which runs windows 8
[03:14:47] <Urchlay> darwin_: OCP? obsessive compulsive personality? :)
[03:15:06] <darwin_> Open Cubic Player
[03:15:07] <Urchlay> ah, music player, no video
[03:15:21] <darwin_> it it can run in text mode
[03:15:29] <darwin_> but it used to run in DOS text & graphics mode
[03:15:34] <Urchlay> no net radio? xmms could do net radio in like 1998 couldn't it?
[03:15:43] <darwin_> Cubic Player is older
[03:16:02] <Urchlay> I'll probably just stick with mplayer, it does what I need, and I'm used to it
[03:16:40] <Urchlay> but what I'm trying to do is come up with a set of "X-less desktop" packages (mostly to see if I can, not for any useful reason, before you ask)
[03:17:02] <darwin_> that would be awesome
[03:17:07] <rennj> mplayer does net radio for me
[03:17:15] <rennj> mplayer -dumpstream is nice to
[03:17:19] <darwin_> I kind of want a set of those, or that Linux would use FBUI
[03:17:30] <Urchlay> fbui? /me searches...
[03:17:35] <darwin_> Cubic player plays lots of formats MPlayer might not
[03:18:06] <Urchlay> heh. Trying to go to the fbui homepage gives me "403 not authorized"
[03:19:17] <Urchlay> hm, interesting. fbui is an in-kernel windowing system.
[03:20:02] <darwin_> not necessarily just windowing
[03:20:04] <darwin_> graphics
[03:20:06] <Urchlay> I wonder if it can co-operate with existing framebuffer and/or directfb apps
[03:20:27] <darwin_> you can use it for windowing or not, but the point is you can run graphics as non-root
[03:20:34] <Urchlay> can already do that though
[03:20:38] <darwin_> how?
[03:20:48] <Urchlay> $ ls -l /dev/fb0
[03:20:48] <Urchlay> crw-rw---- 1 root video 29, 0 Jan 27 22:25 /dev/fb0
[03:20:53] <Urchlay> ...my user's in the video group
[03:21:08] <Urchlay> plain framebuffer and directfb works fine
[03:21:19] <darwin_> ok, but you probably have to use a framebuffer
[03:21:27] <darwin_> without that, it is too bad
[03:21:58] <Urchlay> you can try it yourself with slackware's own mplayer and links... "mplayer -vo fbdev2 file.avi" or "links -g -driver fb http://whatever.com"
[03:22:26] <darwin_> I am well aware you can use graphics if you use a framebuffer
[03:22:36] <darwin_> but what if you do not use a framebuffer, and you want to use something like SVGAlib?
[03:22:44] <Urchlay> in 2013? you're probably SOL
[03:23:00] <Urchlay> I haven't gotten svgalib to work on any system I've tried it on in several years
[03:24:15] <Urchlay> however... back when it used to work, the last few versions of svgalib didn't require root access, if you loaded its kernel module (svga_helper or whatever it was called)
[03:25:40] peaceblaster (~jude@74-131-84-68.dhcp.insightbb.com) joined ##slackware.
[03:26:31] <darwin_> how exactly is a FB slower? Does it take longer to switch from the console to X? I think I noticed that years ago, but I cannot tell if it is faster now
[03:26:40] nachox (~Ignacio@unaffiliated/nachox) left irc: Ping timeout: 260 seconds
[03:27:00] <pi31415> there is an svgalib shim for fb
[03:27:13] <pi31415> so you can compile svgalib programs and run them on the linux fb
[03:27:17] <darwin_> awesome
[03:27:49] <peaceblaster> I should be a lot less helpless now, but xrandr and ctv keep saying "Failed to get size of gamma for output default"
[03:28:03] <pi31415> fbvga http://brightrain.aerifal.cx/~dalias/files/unix/
[03:29:49] <darwin_> also, are there any xterms that can do both text and graphics yet, while perhaps still allowing you to copy text in & out?
[03:30:53] <pi31415> i haven't seen one
[03:31:21] <KaMii> meh.... stupid horde
[03:31:35] <Skywise> i've never heard of a term doing graphics
[03:31:41] <rennj> acme software boa webserver heh
[03:31:44] <darwin_> that fbvga source looks old... I will have to see if I can compile it for x86_64

[03:32:01] <Skywise> what happened KaMii
[03:32:11] <KaMii> supid lvl 90 is stalking me
[03:32:19] <pi31415> Skywise, there were serial terminals that did graphics, and I believe xterm can emulate one of them
[03:32:20] <rennj> err thttpd
[03:32:23] <Urchlay> pi31415: I tried doing that, with the fb shim, and all I got for my efforts was crashes and locked-up consoles.
[03:32:46] <pi31415> tektronix 4014
[03:32:49] <Skywise> pi31415, the vt320 could do color, but i don't think it was raster graphics
[03:34:16] <pi31415> i think i actually saw a tektronix 4014 in use in a geologist's office once
[03:34:19] <Urchlay> darwin_: the fb isn't really all that slow. directfb has the potential to be faster (it supports 2d acceleration on a handful of cards, mostly matrox I think)
[03:35:00] <darwin_> ok; great; I will start using it
[03:35:39] <pi31415> http://jim.rees.org/p/p25/cc67/0250.jpg
[03:35:54] <darwin_> I have a Matrox dual-port card on my p3 that I was using for fb, but the software was difficult or buggy
[03:36:20] <Urchlay> the fb is slightly slower at text-rendering than a real textmode console (you notice it if you e.g. cat a text file), but not really painfully slow (at least not on modern systems)
[03:36:54] <Urchlay> pi31415: if I saw that without knowing what it was, my first guess would be a commodore pet :)
[03:37:38] <darwin_> I am trying to run chroot in an xterm and it is saying 'chroot: failed to run command '/bin/bash': No such file or directory'
[03:37:46] <darwin_> in Konsole
[03:37:55] <KaMii> you  missed a step
[03:37:58] <Urchlay> do you have /bin/bash in your chroot directory? and all the shared libs it needs?
[03:38:03] <darwin_> no
[03:38:10] <Urchlay> well, there ya go
[03:38:28] <darwin_> ok... I am trying to start using chroot to build SlackBuilds
[03:38:38] <Urchlay> the chroot command calls the chroot() function first, then tries to execute whatever its argument was (in the new environment)
[03:39:20] Nick change: Lorem-Ipsum -> Lorem-Ipsum-Droi
[03:39:29] <darwin_> I built fbvga, and it installed to /root/lib
[03:40:15] <Urchlay> easiest thing to do: mkdir /chroot, then installpkg --root /chroot */*.t?z   (assuming you're cd'ed to the slackware dvd's slackware directory, or some place you've downloaded all the packages to)

[03:41:49] <Urchlay> the timestamp on the source tarball says 1999
[03:42:12] <Urchlay> I dunno if you're gonna get that to work on a modern system

[03:43:18] <peaceblaster> Could I get some xrandr help? It keeps saying it can't get size of gamma (I swear this is the last thing I will need to be babied about)
[03:43:34] <darwin_> I got it to compile on x86_64, Urchlay
[03:43:43] <darwin_> I do not know if it will work
[03:44:18] <Urchlay> I expect it'll die horribly and take your console with it, so you'll have to ssh in from another box to reboot. But I'd love to be wrong.
[03:44:19] <KaMii> peaceblaster: nvidia?
[03:45:24] <Urchlay> it might also just crash the kernel. I recommend running "sync; sync" before trying to run anything that uses fbvga (in case it does crash, that should limit the amount of filesystem damage caused by a hard crash)
[03:45:47] <peaceblaster> KaMii: Yes, with 20" and 17" monitors, Only the 20" is recognized, and is running 1280 by 768 atm
[03:46:34] <KaMii> twin view or... whatever the other one is?
[03:46:45] <Urchlay> does xrandr even work with the proprietary nvidia drivers at all?
[03:46:54] <KaMii> Urchlay: works for me
[03:47:08] <KaMii> you just let nvidia make you an xorg.conf
[03:47:08] <Urchlay> (seems like it didn't, when I tried it, but it would have been 2-3 years ago on an old card I don't use any more)
[03:47:57] <Urchlay> nouveau works fine for me (the most graphically-demanding game I play is Doom, so not a problem)
[03:48:05] <peaceblaster> Ummm... not sure my computer has NVidia drivers, where do I check? I noticed I have no xorg.conf
[03:48:25] <peaceblaster> I don't plan to do much that's graphically demandin
[03:48:26] <peaceblaster> g
[03:48:33] <darwin_> pi31415, after I tried Mint for a day, I saw how it might be nice for average users, but I switched back to Slackware the next day. Apparently there are also some tools like from Salix that can make installing software on Slackware slightly easier, but not necessarily more reliable like if you for example close X while using the graphical tools
[03:49:20] <KaMii> peaceblaster: if you want xrandr to work you need nvidia drivers to create an xorg.conf for you
[03:49:31] <peaceblaster> Ok, where/how do I get them?
[03:49:35] <KaMii> so first go to the slackbuilds.org and get the nvidia drivers
[03:49:53] <KaMii> make sure you read the README file first
[03:49:57] <darwin_> The first thing I tried to compile on Mint, I had to install two libraries that are on Slackware, and fix another that had a broken installation but is fine on Slackware
[03:50:06] <KaMii> or I will not help you
[03:50:17] <peaceblaster> ok, on it
[03:53:38] <KaMii> peaceblaster: are you ever planning on installing virtualbox?
[03:53:54] <peaceblaster> not on this OS, no
[03:53:55] <KaMii> if so, you need to use my slackbuild script, because the one on slackbuilds will not work against kernel 3.7.4
[03:54:08] <peaceblaster> um, ok
[03:54:34] <KaMii> so, if you ever plan on using it, just ask me and I will help you with it, as I have written zero readme files.  haha
[03:57:41] <Urchlay> KaMii: eh, if he's got an nvidia card, xrandr works just fine with nouveau
[03:57:58] <Urchlay> doesn't *need* the proprietary driver. Although it'll perform better.
[03:58:15] <KaMii> oh, didnt know that, i only use nvidias drivers... cant stand nouveau
[03:58:23] <Urchlay> why?
[03:58:32] <peaceblaster> alrighty, getting NVidia drivers in, sorry, had to read up on slackbuild
[03:58:43] <KaMii> Urchlay: they dont do half the stuff nvidia drivers can do

[04:00:15] <KaMii> Urchlay: i game, and i need it for WoW
[04:00:44] <KaMii> IMO, if you dont game, then dont buy an nvidia gpu
[04:00:57] <darwin_> in the past ATI drivers had worked fine for me on Slackware, but Nvidia did not
[04:01:20] <KaMii> i've never had an issue with nvidia
[04:01:32] <Urchlay> I bought the one I have because it's better to have more than you need, than it is to find out later that you need more than you have
[04:01:41] <peaceblaster> ok, this slackbuild is messed up, keeps not finding files that are in the directory
[04:01:44] <Urchlay> (plus, it was on sale)
[04:01:52] <darwin_> did not Linus Torvalds just flip Nvidia off a few months ago?
[04:02:02] <pi31415> cheeky fellow
[04:02:06] <darwin_> and tell them, 'f*** you, Nvidia?'
[04:02:20] <pi31415> if it has VESA then it's good enough for me
[04:02:22] <KaMii> peaceblaster: it works, i just used it yesterday
[04:02:44] <Urchlay> when I used to use proprietary nvidia drivers, they worked well enough. At least worth trying.
[04:02:47] <peaceblaster> lol what? http://fpaste.org/Bhg6/
[04:03:26] <KaMii> are you trying the nvidia-kernel or the driver?
[04:03:28] <xocel> nouveau has never worked for me, dont think it likes my card. have to use the proprietary drivers if i want x.
[04:03:36] <peaceblaster> the driver... and brb
[04:03:50] <KaMii> peaceblaster: ok im not helping you, you didnt READ the README
[04:03:57] <darwin_> maybe my problem was Nvidia had not released info about their cards... so if you wanted to program 3D gfx on GNU/Linux, you were limited on how you could

[16:03:45] <wood_quinn> That's the interface.
[16:04:30] <wood_quinn> If anyone else is on the alpha, I'll gladly share a folder full of junk text files with you.
[16:05:09] <wood_quinn> I don't think it's open source, but that's not a deal breaker for me, though it is preferred.
[16:05:41] <hackedhead> how is it more efficient than a private torrent?
[16:05:47] <hackedhead> along what metric?
[16:06:18] <wood_quinn> Because with torrents you have to make and share a new one for each new file added to a directory.
[16:06:39] <wood_quinn> And, this is probably automatically syncing.
[16:06:41] <wood_quinn> So that's definitely a plus.
[16:06:50] <hackedhead> so more efficient to interact with?
[16:06:56] <wood_quinn> Mhm.
[16:07:00] <hackedhead> yeah okay...
[16:07:01] <wood_quinn> Set it and forget it.
[16:07:22] <wood_quinn> 'course along with the intent that is for personal use, I'm sure there's no virus scanning :P
[16:07:34] <hackedhead> but it's still hamstrung by the single uploader problem
[16:07:37] <wood_quinn> So obviously set it and forget it with a concience.
[16:07:43] <ananke> presumably all file additions/changes/removals are tracked and propagated to the other clients. that's why i can't imagine people using it for random downloads
[16:07:45] <hackedhead> + residential connection broadband
[16:07:55] <wood_quinn> hackedhead: Yeah and that's very true.
[16:08:09] <wood_quinn> Unless you're sharing it with a lot of devices I don't know how useful it is.
[16:08:14] <hackedhead> ananke: sure... it's just "dropox by bittorrent" with none of the advantages of the BT protocol...
[16:08:22] <hackedhead> so i don't see what the big deal is...
[16:08:37] <hackedhead> and no cloud storage... which is *shrug*
[16:08:51] <hackedhead> so like... what's the point?
[16:08:56] <ananke> hackedhead: i'm guessing it's more of a solution to synchronizing your own data among multiple systems
[16:09:12] <wood_quinn> I'm sure it has a lot less overhead than FTP, if that's enough of a point.
[16:09:21] <hackedhead> ....
[16:09:28] <wood_quinn> You just ./SyncApp and go to http://localhost:10000
[16:09:38] <hackedhead> FTP doesn't have that much overhead.
[16:09:49] <wood_quinn> Rather than setting up an HTTP/FTP server and getting hosting somewhere.
[16:09:53] <ananke> i can't imagine synchronizing my multiple systems via FTP

[16:11:07] Empty_One (~empty@unknown.wctc.edu) left irc: Ping timeout: 255 seconds

[16:12:37] <wood_quinn> I do see your reservations there.
[16:12:41] <hackedhead> wood_quinn: none.... how could it possibly?
[16:12:52] <hackedhead> BT requires, as a base, multiple DL sources.
[16:12:55] <wood_quinn> The same way a torrent client does.
[16:13:02] <hackedhead> well, i guess if you start having a lot of synced clients

[16:13:07] <hackedhead> it could pull from them all

[16:13:40] <wood_quinn> A seeds, B downloads the first 1/2, C the second 1/2, then B and C swap.
[16:13:45] <wood_quinn> That's BT at it's core.
[16:13:52] <hackedhead> wood_quinn: yeah, i guess i wasn't thinking about syncing device number 3, where you'd start to maybe have an advanteg of two sources to pull from for sync
[16:14:14] Action: wood_quinn nods
[16:14:23] <wood_quinn> So I reserve the right to be giddy.
[16:14:26] <hackedhead> yeah i mean
[16:14:28] <wood_quinn> Heh.
[16:14:31] <hackedhead> if you ahve more than 3 devices.
[16:14:43] <hackedhead> and they are distributed enough to make the BT voerhead worthiwle.
[16:14:47] <ananke> don't you? what, are you living in a cave? :)
[16:14:53] <hackedhead> but like... if they're all in the same LAN, it won't help
[16:15:19] <hackedhead> you'll hit network saturation puling from once source before there's a need for the BT part ot kick in.
[16:15:20] ninjak (~ninjak@77.239.137.142) left irc: Max SendQ exceeded
[16:15:22] <ananke> i'm not sure the goal here is to help with bandwidth use

[16:15:41] <hackedhead> that's it's whole purpose....
[16:15:44] <wood_quinn> Actually if they're all on the same LAN it'd still be convinient, even if it's not fully utiliting the P2P part.

[16:15:57] <hackedhead> wood_quinn: *shrug* NFS is easier to set up...
[16:16:14] <wood_quinn> I disagree, because I don't know how to set up NFS :)

[16:16:28] ninjak (~ninjak@77.239.137.142) joined ##slackware.
[16:16:28] <ananke> NFS is as primitive as it gets, and it's a major PITA when you have mobile devices
[16:16:47] <hackedhead> ananke: fair, but i guess i don't get the "eventually my data will be synced"
[16:16:49] <wood_quinn> Noo! Don't tell me, then my argument isn't valid anymore.
[16:16:51] <ananke> not to mention, it's a completely different paradigm:
[16:17:02] <hackedhead> ananke: i would hate to leave "too early" and then not have data i thought would be synced already
[16:17:10] <ananke> hackedhead: because you obviously are not using your laptop/mobile devices often enough
[16:17:17] <hackedhead> ananke: i guess so.
[16:17:31] <wood_quinn> Hmm it'll finish the sync the next time you connect to the internet.
[16:17:43] <hackedhead> wood_quinn: well, that might be powerful then.
[16:17:45] <ananke> perhaps i should give you some real world examples
[16:18:07] <hackedhead> ananke: the only case i can imagine wnating right now is syncing music to my phone
[16:18:13] <hackedhead> and actually, that would be really nice.
[16:18:41] <ananke> last night i was working on some R code on my laptop. my project was being saved to my ~/Documents/ dir. This morning i walked into my office, and guess what - my ~/Documents on my workstation contained the latest projects from last night
[16:19:14] <hackedhead> yeah fair.
[16:19:24] <ananke> then i can work on it for a little bit, save, and it will be on my laptop. laptop will get the changes, even if i'm in a meeting
[16:19:25] <wood_quinn> Black magic must have been being used.
[16:19:49] <hackedhead> ananke: yeah, i think it's just that i don't use multiple PCs that often
[16:19:50] <ananke> being able to access your data, from any device you own, and be it the latest data - priceless
[16:20:13] <wood_quinn> I only have one machine.
[16:20:19] <wood_quinn> I still see the value lol.

[16:20:37] <hackedhead> it would have been nice in school, to sync my class notes from laptop to desktop
[16:20:41] <ananke> right now most solutions are based around service: spideroak, dropbox, google drive, microsoft skydrive, etc. this allows you to keep data in-house
[16:20:48] <hackedhead> but now i barely travel, so the laptop is underutilized.
[16:21:02] <hackedhead> ananke: yeah, that's helpful.
[16:21:41] <ananke> considering all of those services have a cap on free plans, for people with larger amount of data to sync, i imagine this service would be of use
[16:21:58] <wood_quinn> ananke: Very good point also, this means no provider can take away your data.
[16:22:11] <hackedhead> http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/
[16:22:18] <hackedhead> my friend used this for a while
[16:22:23] <hackedhead> which i guess is the same thing
[16:22:24] <ananke> unison's interface is so fugly, and it's still a pita to use
[16:22:30] <hackedhead> yeah
[16:22:32] <hackedhead> agree
[16:22:52] <ananke> having a service that runs constantly, and does sync without intervention, is a major selling point
[16:22:58] <hackedhead> so we're back to, basically, "who can do a good job first"
[16:23:00] <ananke> unison is like rsync: a one-off thing
[16:23:12] <hackedhead> right
[16:23:26] <hackedhead> but i'm surprised no one had done it till now.

[16:24:53] <wood_quinn> alienBOB messed with a cloud deal, but really it's just a web based collaboration software with sync.
[16:24:55] <hackedhead> this looks like owncloud's idea + dropbox's simplicity
[16:25:02] <ananke> hell, i'd spend $10k/year on a product similar to dropbox/spideroak
[16:25:09] <hackedhead> which would be pretty nice.

[16:25:22] <ananke> hackedhead: yes
[16:25:24] <hackedhead> yeah
[16:25:32] <hackedhead> if you could deploy all in house
[16:25:36] <ananke> btw, owncloud now has sync clients
[16:25:38] <hackedhead> and not risk data in the cloud

[16:26:41] <ananke> having to deal with the limited bandwidth to the outside world, the storage charges for amount of data, and yeah - privacy issues
[16:26:51] <hackedhead> i wonder if i could tell BTsync to mirror my internal and external drives
[16:26:58] <hackedhead> i do it with rsync now, but...
[16:27:02] <hackedhead> that'd be awesome
[16:27:16] <hackedhead> plug drive in, leave overnight, put back in fire safe

[16:28:02] <ananke> which is basically rsync with inotify
[16:28:37] <hackedhead> ananke: hmm... might not deal with the drive coming and going cleanly though?
[16:28:41] <ananke> what i want in house is dropbox/spideroak like service, server based, and ability to do revisions [or at least undelete]

[17:18:30] <Skywise> i stopped eating corn since its all gmo now
[17:18:56] <Young54743> Lots of folks enjoy roasting ears of corn on the grill, meself include. But, Skywise, why would a farmer plat that kind of corn? economical reasons?
[17:19:01] <kuzary> the corn is in all

[17:19:16] <kuzary> it have thousands of uses
[17:19:22] <ananke> corn syrup is in everything
[17:19:36] <Skywise> they can't afford to buy other corn, and if their corn gets contaminated by gmo crops they get billed for the benefit
[17:19:38] <wood_quinn> Corn all the things!
[17:19:51] <Skywise> the farmers are just pawns for the agribusiness

[17:29:34] <core_saint> legacy
[17:29:34] <wood_quinn> I can't remember if you need an old one.
[17:29:41] <Skywise> maybe you should start with huge and just add more modules to it

[17:30:40] <wood_quinn> Just write your own driver.

[17:31:00] <core_saint> lol... yes ill try that
[17:31:37] <core_saint> crap i just have compiled new kernel to find out i forgot to change name in it
[17:31:58] <Skywise> just search and  replace your device name into the file
[17:32:56] <Skywise> the thing i don't get is why have they consistenly been so bad for so long
[17:33:10] <Skywise> i myself would be tired of all the complaints by now
[17:33:33] <core_saint> true
[17:33:46] <wood_quinn> Especially when you consider that no one ships pre-built computers with them.
[17:33:53] <Skywise> lol
[17:33:54] <wood_quinn> When your users "know what they're doing" you'd think they'd care.
[17:34:20] <Skywise> well choosing ati makes 'em a bit suspect
[17:34:35] <Skywise> cause of the drivers thing
[17:35:46] <Skywise> it would be nice if there were 3rd party drivers that were more reasonable
[17:36:12] <Skywise> is there anything like nouveau for ati? or did everyone just say fuck it
[17:37:09] <wood_quinn> Is radeon an open source driver?
[17:37:18] <wood_quinn> Doubt it given the trademarked name being used.
[17:37:30] <Skywise> dunno
[17:37:57] <eviljames> radeon is the open source driver, afaik
[17:37:58] <Skywise> i only have one machine with ati video and i don't use x on it

[17:40:24] <ruskie> erikkugel, radeon is the open source driver name

[17:40:47] <ruskie> erikkugel, and amd provides the specs to the radeon devs
[17:40:58] <ruskie> that's why they drop support in fglrx then
[17:41:04] <Skywise> i wonder why they can't use a monolithic driver like nvidia
[17:41:05] <erikkugel> radeon and radeonhd are open source, but their performance is even worst than fglrx

[17:41:43] <ruskie> Skywise, even nvidia doesn't do that... there's like 5 different versions
[17:41:54] <Skywise> i'd just settle for the best performance my hardware can deliver
[17:41:57] <erikkugel> In the sad days I had a radeon card, I first looked it its supported by FGLRX, if it was, I would try that.
[17:42:38] <erikkugel> For nVidia, I found their linux support just awesome. Of course, nvidia modules are not open source, but they work great and outperform nouveau by an order of magnitude.

[18:11:46] <pi31415> i think dmalloc and efence are not the right tools

[18:11:56] <Blacklite_> i'm setting up an offline system
[18:12:03] <Skaperen> but efence does other things that make programs appear to be larger (spaces for the fences) ... so I'd have to tell it not to add those
[18:12:13] <Blacklite_> funny, opensuse does that
[18:12:28] <nofra> Blacklite_: the DVD contains all of the OFFICIAL packages so if you have that, you have the entire Office 'repo'

[18:12:55] <wood_quinn_> Oman. I think I've stayed connected for more than a minute.
[18:12:58] <nofra> Blacklite_: Slackbuilds just provides slackbuilds and links to the sources
[18:13:14] <Blacklite_> how does slackbuilds work?
[18:13:21] <nofra> Slacky.eu has a repo but, I think it would be hard to snag them all
[18:13:40] <Blacklite_> is it on an apache server?
[18:14:22] <nofra> Blacklite_: 1) Download the slackbuild scripts.  2) Download the app source that is specified in the slackbuild script. 3) Run the slackbuild script and you get a package
[18:14:41] <nofra> Blacklite_: Or just run sbopkg and let it do all the work
[18:14:47] <Blacklite_> that makes sense
[18:14:53] <Blacklite_> cool.
[18:15:11] <Blacklite_> that's more simple than I thought it would be.
[18:15:18] <Blacklite_> I hate rpms.
[18:15:18] <nofra> sbopkg is your firend
[18:15:28] <Blacklite_> firend?
[18:15:32] <Blacklite_> friend?
[18:15:37] <nofra> That's like a friend but better
[18:15:39] <pi31415> huh, linux process accounting may be the wrong tool too
[18:15:53] <Blacklite_> weird.
[18:15:56] <nofra> Blacklite_: Or you can use d4wnr4z0r's sbotools
[18:16:08] <Blacklite_> cool.
[18:16:11] <Blacklite_> thanks.
[18:16:12] <nofra> ...or you can DL the packages themselves
[18:16:25] <Blacklite_> and use make and make install
[18:16:26] <nofra> ...or you can install from source without packages
[18:16:47] <nofra> There's 50,000 ways to get software on your Slack box
[18:16:49] <wood_quinn_> sbopkg allows you to build but not install things.
[18:17:12] <wood_quinn_> So if you just want to make packages for storage on a repo, you can do that.
[18:17:18] <nofra> sbopkg will happily build AND instal too
[18:17:36] <Blacklite_> I just want to be able to install some extra stuff.

[18:19:13] <Blacklite_> ahhh.
[18:19:45] <nofra> 'extra' on the DVD are official packages not considered part of a core Slackware install

[18:40:59] <Blacklite__> I want to have a base system that's not easy to edit. so that all the base packages are relatively the same, then have RPM running on top to add more functionality.
[18:41:27] <wood_quinn> crazypianist: Console blanking is normal.
[18:41:47] <nofra> Blacklite__: USUALLY what people do when installing an RPM on slackware is to write a Slackbuild script that pulls the needed files (e.g. the binary) out of the RPM and puts it in the correct Slackware place
[18:42:01] <crazypianist> well console would not blank when i was using slackware 13
[18:42:16] <Blacklite__> ah. that works.
[18:42:32] <nofra> Blacklite__: Several Slackbuilds scripts do that
[18:42:42] <eviljames> crazypianist: you can set them not to blank, if desired.. is the problem that the system won't come back after tty blanking?
[18:43:02] <Blacklite__> can I convert a slackware tgz package to an rpm package for using with my other desktops?
[18:43:17] <Blacklite__> the other ones are openSUSE
[18:43:25] <wood_quinn> I'm trying to find where you can disable it, but I don't remember where it is.

[18:54:52] <nofra> fellipe: The easy way to do this is to boot from a regular partition and then mount the RAID

[21:08:13] <ananke> if you want to stream more than just audio, look at plex
[21:08:35] <wood_quinn> Heh. I can tell how many times I had to reconnect to Freenode by looking at how many times Freenode tried to connect to my Sync daemon.
[21:10:29] <eviljames> ananke: Yeah, are the plex clients free?
[21:10:54] <wizbit> i like the sound of mdp
[21:10:59] <ananke> eviljames: for ios? no. although now plex has a built-in web client, that works just fine on ios
[21:11:11] <wizbit> i wil research a linux desktop media player what supports mdp
[21:11:15] <wizbit> ill look at that list
[21:11:17] <eviljames> wizbit: mpd, not mdp
[21:11:17] <ananke> wizbit: 'mpd'
[21:11:23] <eviljames> mdp != mpd

[21:15:14] <wizbit> im thinking more of security issues
[21:15:33] <ananke> yeah. just share your music with the world. see how well it works out
[21:16:54] <eviljames> Opening ports to software that likely has bugs, and doesn't really support authentication seems like a wise idea to me.
[21:16:55] <wizbit> if its password protected it will not be shared with the world
[21:17:07] <eviljames> Especially if that software runs with root privs.  Good plan.
[21:17:19] <wood_quinn> So wise.

[21:28:32] <hackedhead> wait wait.
[21:28:51] <hackedhead> i'm nigh-postive mpd does not _require_ root for normal use cases
[21:29:30] <ananke> wizbit: i need more than audio streaming, so i wouldn't use mpd for that primary reason
[21:29:38] <wizbit> if mdp should only be used local, then there is not much point in using it
[21:29:43] <ananke> wizbit: 'mpd'

[22:38:45] <clijunkie> Then typed from the cli, got the error, did if config and now it's there.
[22:38:58] <clijunkie> Strange.  I hope it's just a fluke.
