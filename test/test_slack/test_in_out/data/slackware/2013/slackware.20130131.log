[00:32:24] <jgeboski> KaMii: chromium now requires speech-dispatcher
[00:32:43] <jgeboski> it's part of a new javascript API
[00:32:56] <KaMii> yea, im trying to track down the lib
[00:33:23] <jgeboski> you don't need the libs during run time, you just need the headers at compile time
[00:33:38] <jgeboski> unless, you want the functionality of the new API
[00:33:50] <KaMii> can I jsut do -Duse_system_speech=1
[00:34:25] <KaMii> well i was thinking, why not have the functionality use
[00:34:29] <KaMii> so i need that lib
[00:34:42] <jgeboski> when I last built it, that was not an option, that may have changed
[00:35:15] <jgeboski> KaMii: http://devel.freebsoft.org/speechd
[00:35:33] <KaMii> jgeboski: what build did you try last?
[00:35:37] <jgeboski> if you want a SB for it, https://github.com/jgeboski/SlackBuilds/tree/master/accessibility/speech-dispatcher
[00:35:50] <KaMii> im trying 26.0.1395.1
[00:36:01] <jgeboski> KaMii: 26.0.1387.0
[00:36:08] <jgeboski> 12 days ago
[00:36:40] <jgeboski> KaMii: I also recommend: -Dlinux_link_libspeechd=1
[00:36:50] <jgeboski> that way it won't use libdl during runtime for it
[00:37:34] <KaMii> ok
[00:37:35] <jgeboski> also, save yourself time with: -Duse_system_libpng=0
[00:37:48] <KaMii> already have that
[00:37:56] <KaMii> i also put libevent=1
[00:37:56] <jgeboski> okay, cool
[00:38:00] <jgeboski> yup
[00:38:09] <KaMii> i see no reason to force another dependency

[00:38:23] <jgeboski> yes, plus a lot of other things can and require libevent
[00:38:44] <jgeboski> KaMii: I build with this: https://github.com/jgeboski/SlackBuilds/blob/master/network/chromium/chromium.SlackBuild#L90
[00:38:48] <KaMii> i was wondering if they have their own speechd lib I can use
[00:38:55] <jgeboski> nope :(
[00:39:11] <KaMii> well i can maybe throw together a sbo for speechd
[00:39:49] <jgeboski> speech-dispatcher also has the dependency of dotconf
[00:40:05] <KaMii> yea, im looking at it, i like that i can build flite into it
[00:40:14] <KaMii> or ibm tts
[00:40:14] <jgeboski> but, both scripts should be fairly straight forward
[00:41:04] <KaMii> should i go with ALSA or OSS as standard?
[00:41:59] <jgeboski> for speech-dispatcher?
[00:42:12] <KaMii> yea
[00:42:22] <jgeboski> autoconf will auto detect
[00:42:24] <KaMii> i have options, OSS, ALSA, Pulse
[00:42:33] <KaMii> well i was thinking about forcing it

[00:43:38] <KaMii> wait, you already have a speechd slackbuild?
[00:43:48] <jgeboski> yeah, I linked it above :P

[00:56:38] <KaMii> cli git is a PITA that should be avoided at all costs!
[00:56:53] <jgeboski> for SCM, Git is where it's at, a little complex, but very rich in features
[00:57:12] <mmlj4> jgeboski: what's the runner-up, then? svn?
[00:57:33] <jgeboski> I'd say mercurial as it's at least distributed
[00:58:14] <pi31415> there is a large distance between .bak directories and a dvcs

[01:03:58] <wood_quinn> Not a whole lot of difference between git clone and svn co if you're just going to make && make install.
[01:04:10] <mmlj4> and you would rather see or use what?
[01:04:15] <jgeboski> well, svn would be quicker
[01:04:24] <wood_quinn> Probably.
[01:04:32] <jgeboski> only initially
[01:04:58] <wood_quinn> I have a basic understanding of git, and therefore am able to appreciate what it does a little more than someone like KaMii might.
[01:05:02] <wood_quinn> So I'd say probably it.
[01:05:19] <KaMii> i know what it does, but the cli is a pita to use
[01:05:20] <wood_quinn> Incremental changes alone are very, very nice.
[01:05:27] <KaMii> its not user friendly
[01:05:36] <wood_quinn> Whatever GUI I was using before is pretty good.

[01:19:54] <magma> I think this is some kind of security mechanism

[02:52:19] <nachox> I have a fileserver with more than 20k directories. It is not very clear who the owner of each directory is  (from a business perspective) and i am trying to fix the issue through first asking people that do business controls who the responsible is and then verifying the information with the responsible people and the owner of the parent directory
[02:52:40] <nachox> but once i'm done, I have no idea how i will keep that tidy

[02:56:21] <nachox> I'll be transfering the burden to the operations group because of backups that way, wont i?
[02:56:28] <ananke> and we do take advantage of ACLs, forced groups and permissions, to keep the data with proper perms on each share

[03:37:16] <Soul_keeper> i'm maybe 150 here, could eat whatever I want for months nonstop and likely not get fat
[03:37:17] <shonudo> but the point is, it doesn't matter where you get the calories from
[03:37:25] <shonudo> it's the number of calories that matters
[03:37:35] <MLanden> shonudo: always Bimbos (the cake,not the other)..wait..erm >.<
[03:37:35] <BrokenCog> shonudo: that is the Big Myth.  calories are not equal.
[03:37:47] <shonudo> you think?
[03:37:51] <shonudo> it's a calorie
[03:37:53] <BrokenCog> no.
[03:37:57] <shonudo> it may toast your liver
[03:38:05] <byteframe> Hes correct. Theres 10 less calories in a full size Milky Way.
[03:38:18] <shonudo> (i.e., someone who gets all calories from vodka)
[03:38:25] <shonudo> but a calorie is a calorie
[03:38:52] <BrokenCog> well, modern medicine says it differently.
[03:39:08] <BrokenCog> now book - Fat Chance - summarizes it all up nicely.
[03:39:12] <BrokenCog> s/now/new/
[03:39:16] <shonudo> never read it

[03:46:09] <BrokenCog> climate change is easy to show.  People choose to ignore it while they argue about what caused it.  somehow that seems to make people feel that it won't affect them.

[04:15:34] <ananke> darwin_: look at the MTA logs on both ends
[04:15:47] <darwin_> ok
[04:15:48] <ananke> you do have MTAs running on each system, right?
[04:15:53] <darwin_> I am not sure
[04:16:11] <ananke> why do you even bother with e-mail anyway?
[04:16:38] <darwin_> it is what I and the others here are used to
[04:16:58] <ananke> for what purpose exactly?
[04:17:25] <darwin_> the purposes email was designed for
[04:17:47] <darwin_> they are not going to sign up for an IM service
[04:17:58] <ananke> sending text messages from one system to another? hah. that's so 1975
[04:18:10] <ananke> setting up your own jabber server would be much easier
[04:18:28] <darwin_> we already have Unix talk running on the LAN
[04:18:35] <darwin_> which is better, so I do not need jabber
[04:18:35] <shonudo> email is ubiquitous
[04:18:41] <ananke> yeah. another antiquated and lousy protocol
[04:18:51] <shonudo> doubt you're going to change corporate culture in a day

[04:19:38] <shonudo> well, any group that communicates via email would count
[04:19:47] <ananke> and the idea that somebody would be using e-mail to send messages from one system to another, directly, is just silly
[04:20:22] <darwin_> it is better than sending them through an external server
[04:20:26] <darwin_> which we do now anyway
[04:20:30] <ananke> shonudo: now that's a self serving prophecy
[04:20:58] <pi31415> howdy darwin_
[04:21:03] <darwin_> peace be with you
[04:21:12] <ananke> darwin_: you would be setting up your own internal server, not sending emails to individual servers running on each system
[04:21:23] <darwin_> I want to do that anyway

[04:21:32] <ananke> do what anyway?
[04:22:03] <darwin_> set up an email server
[04:22:21] <pi31415> ananke, going by the RFC, email is sending text messages ala 1975
[04:22:24] <darwin_> if that is how it has to be done, but I was planning on learning that anyway
[04:22:32] <ananke> pi31415: indeed. let's go back to UUCP
[04:22:45] <ananke> darwin_: that's the only sane way
[04:23:02] <pi31415> ananke: you mean guucp
[04:23:08] <ananke> pi31415: no, i mean UUCP

[04:25:09] <ananke> darwin_: yes. now you need to look at the logs
[04:26:20] <ananke> darwin_: seriously. nobody sane deploys their own e-mail these days, especially on a small scale
[04:26:36] <pi31415> ananke, i may have finally grokked your point that not all text based protocols are created equally
[04:26:52] <pi31415> ananke: you would be wrong there
[04:27:02] <pi31415> ananke: otherwise, why would vmware buy zimbra?
[04:27:08] <ananke> pi31415: i was referring to the original method of e-mail transport
[04:27:11] <darwin_> the logs where I sent from are saying: 'stat=Deferred: Connection timed out with <host>'

[04:28:17] <ananke> pi31415: of course not. they're still using lotus
[04:28:37] <pi31415> the people who deploy zimbra are the ones too cheap to fork out for exchange or hosted exchange
[04:28:39] <ananke> darwin_: how many people are involved in this?
[04:28:43] <pi31415> iow, small businesses
[04:28:45] tpollard (~tpollard@59.167.220.45) joined ##slackware.
[04:28:57] <darwin_> I am the only person configuring it, and two other people would use it
[04:29:14] <darwin_> maybe one other person occasionally in the future
[04:29:14] <darwin_> when I telnetted, it said: Connected to localhost. Escape character is '^]'. 220 <host> ESMTP Sendmail 8.14.5/8.14.5; Wed, 30 Jan 2013 20:20:18 -0800
[04:29:15] <ananke> ha. nobody deploys zimbra on a scale of 3 people
[04:29:53] <ananke> it's an overkill, for something that can be satisfied via other means much easier
[04:30:02] <pi31415> on a scale of 3 people he can do it however he likes and who are we to say it is wrong?
[04:30:29] <ananke> pi31415: he can do whatever he likes. i'm not saying he's wrong to do it. i'm saying it's a silly thing to do
[04:30:36] <darwin_> to me it is more valuable to learn how to set up an email server than all these new things that, as I said, the others here do not want to use, and if I did it professionally, it is unlikely they would immediately want to use something new and not email
[04:30:41] <pi31415> why actually learn something when you can bribe the neighbor kid to do it for you?
[04:31:07] <KaMii> only i possess the right to judge what is right and wrong!
[04:31:22] <ananke> pi31415: for the same reason you don't learn everything under the sun
[04:31:27] Action: pi31415 flees kamii's judgment
[04:31:57] <pi31415> ananke: it is impossible to learn everything under the sun, but you can learn anything under the sun
[04:32:00] <KaMii> yes... YEEEEEHHHHHHHHSSSSSS... flee little one... FLEEE!!!!!!  (evil laugh)
[04:32:05] <ananke> darwin_: now that's a completely different goal. education is a valid reason.
[04:32:11] <darwin_> it is silly when people push new gimmick technology and are against what has a reliable history and works well, and is most widely used
[04:32:15] <Skywise> darwin, what you need to do is setup a smtp host on your lan and configure all your clients to use it, otherwise each client will try to access the reciepients mailhost directly
[04:32:34] <darwin_> ok
[04:32:46] <pi31415> darwin_: anake strikes me as a very experienced person who might be of some educational value
[04:32:47] <ananke> darwin_: problem is that the part of 'works well' depends on people who know how to manage it well
[04:32:52] <pi31415> s/anake/ananke/
[04:33:34] <pi31415> Skywise, i seem to recall MTA's referring to that as a smarthost
[04:33:46] <pi31415> 1 smarthost to rule them all
[04:33:48] <darwin_> yes, I think ananke knows a lot... I just disagree with people arguing for all this new stuff like IM rather than IRC, and smartphones rather than email
[04:34:09] <Skywise> yeah, why configure everyone when you can just configure one
[04:34:14] <ananke> darwin_: IM often makes more sense than IRC
[04:34:25] <darwin_> only for average users
[04:34:43] <darwin_> would you prefer this entire channel was carried out through some minor, centralized, IM network
[04:34:45] <darwin_> ?
[04:34:47] <pi31415> darwin_: with me it is the reverse.. those people disagree with me
[04:34:47] <ananke> darwin_: not for average users, but for plenty of people. IRC has plenty of drawbacks
[04:35:10] <ananke> darwin_: you're comparing a goal of serving thousands of people to a goal of serving 3 folks
[04:35:18] <ananke> apples and oranges
[04:35:34] <pi31415> the main difference between im and irc, from a user point of view, is the interface, and that is merely a matter of selecting a client
[04:35:45] <ananke> not to mention, for collaboration IRC is a major pita, because there is no easy access to history
[04:36:04] <ananke> not without setting up bots, or leaving open sessions
[04:36:08] <darwin_> you can keep logs, and actually, this channel is logged publicly
[04:36:10] <pi31415> some irc clients save history exactly like some im clients do
[04:36:20] <ananke> darwin_: see above. you just described poor workarounds
[04:36:30] <ananke> pi31415: they can't save what they weren't exposed to
[04:36:41] <pi31415> ananke: same with the im client
[04:36:56] <pi31415> oh, you mean queued messages rather than a chat log
[04:36:58] <ananke> pi31415: not at all. with jabber chatrooms the server saves it
[04:37:13] <ananke> and when you join the chatroom, you get presented with the content you have missed while you were not there
[04:37:25] <pi31415> i was thinking of old fashioned aim/msn/etc.
[04:38:56] <ananke> so you can see why IM is often a much better option, and why it would be recommended over IRC
[04:39:19] <pi31415> for 3 people, i'd probably just use the isp's mta
[04:39:26] <ananke> let's not pretend that somehow 'oldschool' solutions are better, just because they've been around for a few more years
[04:39:42] <Skywise> setting up an irc server and a bot for logging its pretty trivial
[04:39:53] <ananke> Skywise: so now you maintain two things.
[04:40:02] <Skywise> you don't really have to maintain them
[04:40:25] <ananke> sure you do. the install/configure is still part of that maintenance cycle
[04:40:43] <Skywise> you just have the bots join the channels and then email you the logs periodically
[04:40:45] <pi31415> when i was first exposed to jabber all of the servers were written in java and they seemed unstable
[04:40:53] <Demon_Fox> damn
[04:40:56] <ananke> and then you have fun time with the interface. when joining back, you have to deal with sending commands to the bot
[04:40:57] <pi31415> now there are all kinds of choices
[04:41:18] <Skywise> if the bot is just for logging, you wouldn't have to do anything with it
[04:41:20] <ananke> Skywise: ohh, 'e-mail'. so you now are going back to the original solution
[04:41:24] <Skywise> it wouldn't have to control the channel
[04:41:36] <Skywise> well if you don't want it to email you the logs, you can download them
[04:41:55] <darwin_> an ISPs MTA would be more reliable than something like Google, except if the WAN connection went down
[04:42:21] <pi31415> heh, silly me, jabberd's c++
[04:42:22] <ananke> darwin_: google is pretty damn reliable
[04:42:25] <darwin_> and I am thinking of using a MTA when I develop my web site more
[04:42:31] <Skywise> but setting up and maintaining a jabber network and users has its own overhead, and if you're gonna connect with other servers, thats even more complexity
[04:42:39] <pi31415> all of the servers I interacted with were written in Java
[04:42:41] <darwin_> just a couple days ago, someone here sent me gmail two or three times and it still has not arrived
[04:42:45] <darwin_> it happened a few times in the past
[04:42:48] <darwin_> it is not even in 'spam'
[04:43:07] <Demon_Fox> Seems like one conversation after another tonight
[04:43:14] <ananke> darwin_: yet you were able to check your e-mail
[04:43:20] <Skywise> setting up an mta does have a learning curve and its important to know what you're doing because a misconfigured server can be a menace
[04:43:23] <darwin_> not always, though
[04:43:26] <pi31415> i think google's reliability is comparable to an isp's
[04:43:29] <darwin_> that has failed with gmail many times, also
[04:43:40] <pi31415> i've seen gmail go down for a day a handful of times ever
[04:44:30] <ananke> Skywise: which is a major argument against doing it on a small scale
[04:44:38] <KaMii> what happens if your BLT drive goes AWOL?
[04:44:42] <pi31415> on a small scale, start small
[04:44:46] <pi31415> do local only
[04:44:50] <Demon_Fox> Anyone know the transfer limit on usb 2.0 off the top of their head?
[04:44:51] <shonudo> bacon lettuce and tomato?
[04:44:52] <pi31415> set up multiple accounts in the mua
[04:45:00] <shonudo> KaMii, are you snacking?
[04:45:03] <KaMii> you order a bigmac
[04:45:09] <KaMii> shonudo: no its from the movie hackers
[04:45:11] <shonudo> i order an emac
[04:45:18] <shonudo> burger of champions
[04:45:23] <ananke> on a small scale, there are tons of better projects for you to get some experience with
[04:45:54] <KaMii> my blt drive just went awol while I was working on this big file for mr kawasaki, and if I dont get it back, hes going to ask me to comit harry carry (or something like that)
[04:46:02] <ananke> and ultimately, while knowing how to set up MTA may be of some use to you, it's unlikely that you're going to use it much in your professional life
[04:46:06] <pi31415> i plan to tinker with citadel soon, which happens to be a small scale MTA/MUA with XMPP and other goodies
[04:46:22] <darwin_> ok, so despite Wikipedia lists sendmail as a MTA, apparently I need to set up IMAP or POP... what is the best IMAP server?
[04:46:32] <Demon_Fox> KaMii, Would you by chance know the USB 2.0 transfer limit?
[04:46:36] <ananke> darwin_: dovecot is a good choice

[04:46:45] <pi31415> dovecot rocks
[04:46:50] <KaMii> Demon_Fox: sucky?
[04:46:52] <pi31415> friendly documentation
[04:46:54] <ananke> darwin_: and of course you need imap or pop. MTA just delivers e-mail.
[04:47:03] <KaMii> use firewire
[04:47:27] <darwin_> I used to use fetchmail

[04:48:26] <ananke> darwin_: point being, look at the protocols it supports
[04:48:38] <KaMii> i think its something like 420
[04:49:07] <pi31415> i switched from fetchmail to getmail

[05:39:33] <darwin> apparently one some computers I email on, I do not need more than sendmail: on one I telnetted to localhost and sent a message to myself right in sendmail... I guess it is just not configured to accept messages from other hosts, or the others need DNS (not just /etc/hosts)
[05:40:28] <darwin> of course, the other users do not have a system with a mailspool and would not want to use one after most GUI email clients stopped using those well
[05:41:44] <darwin> it is a bit strange you can automatically talk user@host, write user@host, etc. on a LAN, but not mail user@host on one

[05:42:14] <Skywise> darwin, its more complicated then that
[05:42:34] <Skywise> when you're sending mail locally, its different then sending to another computer, even on a lan
[05:43:18] <Skywise> what you need to do is come up with 1 host that people read email from and send email to
[05:43:23] <darwin> yeah; I guess on some huge LAN, there might be places they do not want everyone to automatically mail
[05:43:48] <Skywise> the proper way would be to setup dns for your lan and specify an MX host on your lan, then everyone on the lan will be able to use it automatically
[05:44:26] <pi31415> if you can find an ebook or howto, then read that
[05:44:27] <Skywise> if you also setup an smtp server, then everyone can use that for outgoing email
[05:44:31] <darwin> I have not heard the acronym 'MX,' but I think I am working on that
[05:44:46] <pi31415> it probably wouldn't hurt to check openbsd's documentation, or another bsd handbook
[05:44:48] <Skywise> its a specific dns record type
[05:45:00] <darwin> I searched the OpenBSD's FAQ and am reading the Dovecot docs
[05:45:18] <Skywise> it stands for mail exhange, and says what host is to be sent email for the domain
[05:45:32] <Skywise> you can specifiy more then 1 host and they can be prioritized
[05:46:23] <pi31415> http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/mail.html
[05:46:37] <darwin> I have DNS running now and will find some info on MX... thanks

[05:48:22] <pi31415> i like postfix better than sendmail because the config and docs seem a little less dense
[05:48:40] <pi31415> it doesn't hurt that it works really well
[05:51:03] <darwin> yeah... when I was still using CLI email clients and used sendmail either to mail, or just to transfer stuff from root to my user account, after I switched back from NetBSD to Slackware for a desktop, I could never figure out sendmail, which is one reason I switched to Thunderbird to read email

[07:24:21] <KaMii> last time i did multilibs i hated it
[07:24:58] <Skywise> you can use 8gb just fine with 32gb

[07:44:52] <KaMii> well i was thinking more, loading / into ram
[07:45:22] <KaMii> a full slack intstall minus kde and kerenl sources will fit
[07:45:23] <Skywise> if you think its worth the money

[07:45:37] <KaMii> no money to spend I have the ram here right now
[07:45:44] fisted_ (~fisted@unaffiliated/fisted) joined ##slackware.
[07:45:52] <KaMii> wonder what kind of speed i would get?
[07:46:07] <KaMii> bet boot time would take forever though.. that ramdisk would be huge to load
[07:46:19] <Skywise> i found a box the other day full of laptop memory, but who wants 64 and 256mb sticks of memory
[07:46:34] Nick change: fisted_ -> fisted
[07:46:43] <KaMii> hrm, not sure you can do much with them
[07:46:50] <Skywise> i would expect it to be faster operationally, X would be pretty cool from ram
[07:47:08] <KaMii> x would be so fast, things would open before you clicked on them
[07:47:15] <Skywise> no, they're only valuable in the 3rd world for the next couple of months
[07:47:25] <KaMii> lol
[07:48:08] <Skywise> i'm sure they only get $5 on ebay
[07:49:02] <KaMii> if they still work
[07:49:50] <KaMii> but ram is soo cheap now, i dont think you could give those away
[07:49:53] <Skywise> yeah, they're all good, i've upgraded the laptops they're from

[07:50:12] <Skywise> and my laptops are maxed out
[07:51:30] <KaMii> to what? 512
[07:52:16] <KaMii> my uncle said back in the early 90's he spent $2000 on 16 megs of ram
[07:52:24] <KaMii> i slapped him
[07:52:46] <KaMii> oh and he said he had a 480 meg hdd
[07:53:01] <KaMii> and everyone told him never in a million years would anyone need 480 megs of hdd space
[07:53:02] <Skywise> they were even smaller then that before
[07:53:21] <Skywise> yeah, because files were small and so were programs
[07:53:31] <KaMii> i cant justify spending $2000 on ram
[07:53:34] <Skywise> but then came mp3s and you could fill that up in a hurry
[07:53:38] <KaMii> and he did that on just 16 megs of it?
[07:53:53] <Skywise> yeah, thats kinda crazy, but then i usually had companies buy my equipment

[07:54:19] <Skywise> i don't think i've ever spent more then 2k on a whole computer
[07:54:39] <KaMii> well yea, i dont think then had much multimedia back in the ancient days (1990's)
[07:55:16] <KaMii> i think he said he spent close to $3000 on that machine
[07:55:29] <Skywise> yeah, you had a cd for installing software, and if you player music, it was the wav off the cd
[07:55:33] <KaMii> he said it took a day to compile the linux kernel
[07:55:42] <Skywise> it never took that long
[07:55:48] <KaMii> he said cd drives didnt exist yet
[07:55:56] <Skywise> i call shenanigans
[07:56:01] ninjak (~ninjak@77.239.137.142) joined ##slackware.
[07:56:25] <KaMii> well a day for him is like 20 minutes for the rest of reality
[07:56:32] <KaMii> he is the most impatient person ever
[07:56:48] <Skywise> even on a 486 it didn't take all day, not even a hour
[07:56:56] <KaMii> it was a 486
[07:57:01] <Skywise> yeah, i bet he's kinda rash too
[07:57:06] <KaMii> he said the 386 at his work took a weekend to compile a kernel
[07:57:13] <KaMii> and he said they kept running out of ram

[07:57:20] <Skywise> i think he was doing something wrong
[07:57:25] <KaMii> so thats why he bough 16 megs, so he wouldnt run into that issue
[07:57:33] <KaMii> probably, idk
[07:57:48] <Skywise> yeah, you shouldn't run out memory compiling, it does it in segments
[07:57:52] <KaMii> now he uses ...... OSX
[07:58:08] <Skywise> well its prolly better that way
[07:58:17] <KaMii> maybe he meant swap?
[07:58:17] <Skywise> he likes spending money

[07:58:42] <KaMii> cant you run into compile issues if you dont have enough swap?
[07:58:50] <KaMii> and very little ram
[07:59:14] <Skywise> i dunno, it was never very demanding in my opinion, but maybe some people had less capable equipment
[07:59:19] <KaMii> idk i never ran a stoneage computer before
[07:59:32] <Skywise> they work pretty much the same
[08:00:18] <Skywise> i know i could never have more then 2 or 3 kernels sources cause i'd run out of space
[08:00:21] <ventYl> with plenty of swap it only will take forever to compile

[08:01:02] <ventYl> i remember that on my first computer which was able to run unix/linux i have to choose between enough space for burning CD from windows 98 or installing redhat w/ kernel sources
[08:01:07] <Skywise> compiling was something you set off and then came back too, but it was only for minutes maybe 20 or 30
[08:01:27] <KaMii> maybe that was his problem he didnt have much ram before and it was hitting swap so it took forever, then he got 16 megs of ram and it went faster
[08:01:43] <Skywise> i prefer to believe he screwed it up
[08:02:03] <KaMii> lol possible, he said he was learning
[08:02:08] <ventYl> w/ 8meg of ram even start of pppd took forever if one had swap on floppy
[08:02:29] <KaMii> swap on floppy?  thats possible?
[08:02:33] <ventYl> why not?
[08:02:37] <KaMii> why would you?
[08:02:39] <Skywise> but thats ok, i had a friend who almost killed himself after trying to format a drive for a week without knowing what partitioning was
[08:02:57] <KaMii> Skywise: lmfao
[08:03:01] <KaMii> rtfm?
[08:03:03] <Keshl> KaMii: Linux doens't stop you from doing stupid things, because that'd stop you from doing smart things too. oÉo.
[08:03:24] <Skywise> yeah, he finally got some help and they fixed it for him
[08:03:34] <KaMii> just seems 1.4 mb of swap is kinda pointless
[08:03:34] <ventYl> initrd used more than half of RAM and in order to start pppd to be able transfer e2utils to that machine i had to use swap. otherwise pppd ran out of memory
[08:03:49] <Keshl> KaMii: What if you're living in the 80's?
[08:03:55] <Keshl> And 1 meg of RAM is considered huge? oÉo?
[08:03:59] <ventYl> KaMii: 1.68
[08:04:01] <KaMii> Keshl: go outside?
[08:04:07] <Keshl> KaMii: Outside sucks. D:
[08:04:09] <KaMii> use your 8-track
[08:04:11] <Skywise> you weren't using linux in the 80s
[08:04:15] <Keshl> Did yoyu see the latest graphical updates? Horrible!
[08:04:25] <KaMii> and listen to...... whats his name... tone loc

[08:05:38] <KaMii> i hear pong was epic
[08:06:01] <KaMii> and people say WoW is a waste of time.....
[08:06:31] <ventYl> Skywise: i have so many RAM modules here i can scratch symbols on them and use it as play cards for poker :)
[08:06:38] <Skywise> the problem with pong is you needed an opponent, so then came brickout

[08:07:37] <Skywise> yeah, they wanted it to be a group activity
[08:07:49] <KaMii> how is 2 people a group?
[08:07:53] <Skywise> people get tired of watching real fast
[08:08:06] <Skywise> the games don't last forever, you play to 21
[08:08:09] <rachael> need a pong version of chatroulette ?
[08:08:20] <KaMii> no idea what that is
[08:08:25] <Skywise> nothing needs chatroulette
[08:08:40] <KaMii> sounds like spin the bottle for irc
[08:08:47] <Skywise> thats ok, i think a mob of women stormed the servers and shut it down

[08:10:48] <Skywise> they're not all that scary
[08:11:14] <KaMii> i would laugh
[08:11:27] <Skywise> well if they're still running you can try it out
[08:11:37] <KaMii> i'd rather play WoW
[08:11:47] <KaMii> im not into webcams
[08:11:56] <KaMii> i find that whole thing creepy

[08:13:39] <KaMii> just think of all the drama
[08:13:54] <Skywise> i have a friend who becomming a cat person and i don't wanna say anything
[08:14:12] <KaMii> one cat is ok, but like 6 of them... problem!
[08:14:16] <Skywise> cause i don't think it would be fair for anyone to have to live with them
[08:14:33] <Skywise> so i'm like keep the cats and save humanity
[08:15:08] <ventYl> two cats are usually less problematic than one

[08:15:23] <KaMii> my cat isnt a problem
[08:15:31] <Skywise> not yet

[08:16:13] <Skywise> no, thats another issue
[08:16:31] <KaMii> the cat is basically their baby?
[08:16:57] <Skywise> its the same disorder that has women making their daughters wear makeup in a preschool beauty pagent
[08:17:00] <Skywise> yeah
[08:17:05] <KaMii> i saw this show once on these people, the lady couldnt have kids so she makes these life like baby dolls... and well basically she treats the doll like its her real child.. really creapy
[08:17:22] <Skywise> yeah, kinda sad
[08:17:25] <ventYl> one cat sometimes gets too bored and then it tries to destroy something to get entertained
[08:17:37] <KaMii> yea... preteen beauty pageants are... basically opening the door for pedos
[08:17:44] <Skywise> a well balanced person could adopt and then still get to raise a child
[08:18:02] <Skywise> i don't think its pedofilia, but i think it is creepy
[08:18:14] <ventYl> two cats can entertain themselves on their own and usually don't need destory anything
[08:18:20] <KaMii> no they arent, but they are inviting them basically
[08:18:27] <Skywise> its perverted to sexualize a child like that
[08:18:27] <KaMii> everyone knows pedos hang out at those events
[08:18:45] <Skywise> maybe its run by pedos
[08:18:46] <KaMii> or at least get online and get off on the pics
[08:19:00] <Skywise> the money is comming from somewhere
[08:19:16] <KaMii> like that dance moms show?  i saw an episode of that and i was like, wtf?
[08:19:20] <Skywise> but the parents are pushing the kids in to it too
[08:19:39] <KaMii> thats sad

[08:26:16] <Skywise> i didn't like it
[08:26:20] <KaMii> so far it seems the show followed the book 100%
[08:26:26] <KaMii> i loved the show
[08:26:32] <KaMii> i bought the blueray
[08:26:41] <Skywise> it was predictable, everyone was going to do the worst possible thing
[08:26:49] <KaMii> duh
[08:26:53] <Skywise> heh
[08:26:56] <KaMii> i knew that already
[08:26:58] <Skywise> ok
[08:27:04] <KaMii> thats why i liked it
[08:27:15] <KaMii> its not like some disney crap where everone lives hapily ever after
[08:27:23] <Skywise> yeah, i think thats why most people like it
[08:27:39] <KaMii> and yoru favorite character dies really fast...
[08:27:39] <Urchlay> tyrion doesn't always do the worst possible thing
[08:27:45] <KaMii> kinda pissed me off a bit but...
[08:27:55] <KaMii> well at first you hate the imp
[08:27:59] <KaMii> then you really start to like him
[08:28:02] <Skywise> yeah mostly everyone dies
[08:28:08] <KaMii> dont ruin it for me
[08:28:15] <Skywise> if i was there, i'd run everytime i saw a camera
[08:28:16] <KaMii> im only on the first book
[08:28:41] <Urchlay> that's probably sound advice anyway
[08:28:46] <KaMii> i just want that little punk shit of a kid king to die a horrible death
[08:29:11] <KaMii> but yea, when ned stark died, i cried
[08:29:13] <Urchlay> read the rest of the books

[08:31:18] <Urchlay> does boromir count as good or bad?
[08:31:32] <KaMii> well.. he was good but got influenced by the ring
[08:31:37] <KaMii> because he has weak constitution
[08:31:57] <Urchlay> yeah, because the DM wouldn't let his player optimize the stats
[08:32:06] <KaMii> the ring corrupted him, he wanted it to do good, but realized too late his error, and that made him good because he realized
[08:32:12] <KaMii> lol
[08:32:43] <KaMii> wait... was Tolkeins friend.. whats his name... lion witch and the wardrobe writer... was he the DM for LOTR?

[08:36:47] <KaMii> omg, HORRIBLE, what was hideous is that it ever got published
[08:37:36] <Urchlay> bad writing, or just a bad idea for a book?
[08:37:51] <KaMii> it was lewis trying to write scifi
[08:38:00] <KaMii> and... he should just avoid it at all costs
[08:38:38] <KaMii> it gets great review by christians, they keep talking about all this christian symbology or somthing idk... i thought it was a horrible book

[08:40:15] <KaMii> so i figured, you wont get it unless you are a Lewistian christain
[08:40:57] <KaMii> yea he kept trying to convert Tolkein
[08:41:04] <Urchlay> OTOH, there's a book by mark twain called 'letters from earth'
[08:41:22] <Urchlay> which is similar (it's told from satan's POV)
[08:41:35] <KaMii> any good?
[08:41:38] <Urchlay> yeah
[08:42:03] <Urchlay> twain's a good enough writer to make it not boring even if you're not a believer
[08:42:54] <Urchlay> plus, twain's whole point seems to be "god is good, but organized religion is retarded"

[08:52:45] <Urchlay> book 4 (god emperor) is too damn long, and it feels like nothing happens for most of it
[08:53:34] <Urchlay> books 5 and 6 didn't quite make sense to me (but they were pretty obviously building up to whatever point he was gonna make in book 7 if he'd lived to write it)
[08:53:37] <KaMii> well yea, but its important history

[08:54:36] <KaMii> yea i heard thats what 5 and 6 were, which is why i havent really read them
[08:54:39] <KaMii> not sure if I ever will
[08:55:12] <Keshl> Urchlay: Which one do you recommend starting with, oÉo? I've been curious about it lately <É<
[08:55:20] <KaMii> well.. i forget the title of the second book, but thats basically filler for children of dune
[08:55:28] <KaMii> Keshl: read Dune
[08:55:29] <Urchlay> Keshl: the one that's just called Dune
[08:55:31] <KaMii> thats the best place to start
[08:55:32] <Keshl> oÉo.
[08:55:37] <Keshl> Dankies -É-
[08:55:50] <KaMii> and i suggest reading it more than once
[08:55:55] <Keshl> oÉo Wai?
[08:56:15] <KaMii> its so full of stuff you need to read it more than once, at least everytime i re-read it, i learn something new
[08:56:30] <Urchlay> there's a lot there, and on 2nd reading you'll understand the stuff that happens earlier in the book
[08:56:52] <KaMii> read it once with a religious perspective, onece for a political perspective, and once for an ecology perspective
[08:57:06] <Keshl> Oh. Dang, nevermind, not the book for me then.
[08:57:14] <KaMii> trust me, you will love it
[08:57:16] <Keshl> I can't stand stuff where it won't make sense unless you already know what's gunna happen. <.<
[08:57:22] <Keshl> Makes me wanna gut the author/director with a spoon.
[08:57:23] <KaMii> it will make sense to you
[08:57:29] <Urchlay> it's not that it doesn't make any sense at all
[08:57:32] <KaMii> you will just find new things out the more times you read it

[08:58:45] <KaMii> no, god, little g
[08:58:48] <Keshl> And no, I'd never do that with a book.. Or TV series or movie, for that matter.
[08:58:52] <Urchlay> however. At the back of the book is a dictionary. I recommend referring to it in the early parts of the book (it doesn't contain any spoilers)
[08:59:03] <Keshl> *God <.< Any refrence to God gets caplitized by me. you can ignore it, I don't mind, but I still do them unconditionally.
[08:59:09] <KaMii> Urchlay: there does exist a dune encyclopedia
[09:00:01] <KaMii> Keshl: God refers to a one true God as in a religion, god refers to a god of just one thing, like god of scifi, is not also god of water
[09:00:04] <Keshl> ..Also, wait, Dune's sci-fi? Not fantasy, oÉo?
[09:00:09] <Keshl> *God times three
[09:00:11] <Keshl> four*
[09:00:15] <Urchlay> Keshl: it wasn't a reference to "the" god... calling a human a god of something doesn't get capitalized (do you capitalize the word when you're writing about the ancient greek gods? if you believe in those, replace ancient greek with something you don't believe in)
[09:00:25] <Keshl> *God, times three.
[09:00:39] <Keshl> It's got 3 letters and spells "dog" backwords. It's getting caplitized.
[09:00:45] <KaMii> he doesnt understand how english works
[09:00:56] <Urchlay> wouldn't even be capitalizing your name if my irc client didn't autocomplete it :)
[09:01:04] <Keshl> I'd rather not get into this. <.<
[09:01:05] <KaMii> same here
[09:01:09] <Urchlay> KaMii: well don't start a fight with him about it
[09:01:15] <KaMii> Keshl: then stop bringing it up
[09:01:17] <Keshl> Just accept the fact that I'm gunna keep doing it, please. Seriously, just ignore it.
[09:01:19] <Keshl> KaMii: You first.
[09:01:28] <Keshl> Don't mention His name, you won't get corrections.
[09:01:40] <KaMii> jesus tapdancing christ... im going back to game of thrones
[09:01:45] <Keshl> *Jesus, Christ
[09:01:49] <Keshl> Bais, oÉo.
[09:01:51] <Urchlay> thought the actual name was something else. YHVH?
[09:01:54] Action: KaMii the goddess is going back to reading
[09:02:14] <Keshl> Again, I'd rather not get into this, but appearntly you won't stop, so I'll explain.
[09:02:35] <Urchlay> eh, no, I'm not trying to have an argument, just trying to understand your POV
[09:02:37] <Keshl> There is no logical explination, except one, that explains what happens to me when I stop doing these corrections.
[09:02:44] <Urchlay> apologies if it seems rude
[09:02:47] <Keshl> About a year ago I didn't do them.
[09:02:59] <Keshl> And really bad stuff started happening to me, stuff that normally doens't happen.
[09:03:03] <KaMii> ok, i can exlain also, i am a goddes in my druidic order, it is not a capital G because I am not a goddess of all druidic orders, only one druidic order.
[09:03:32] <Keshl> Me setting my hair on fire when I work around candles a lot and know how not to do that, my pants and underwear falling down in public when they're normally dead tight, ingrown toenail (needed surgery to remove it), computers dying horrible deaths..
[09:03:41] <Keshl> One day out of the blue I started making corrections and it stopped.
[09:03:57] <Keshl> Every time I stop making them, horrible things start happening again. Sometimes it's to me, sometimes my parents, sometimes my pets.
[09:04:02] <Urchlay> hm. Be thankful you weren't using unix in the 1970s, or something like an original apple II, you might have gotten stuck with uppercase-only
[09:04:05] <Keshl> Point is, if I stop, bad crap happens. So I'm not stopping.
[09:04:12] <KaMii> so, because other people say god, and if you dont correct it, your hair will catch on fire?  i would seriously stop worshing that deity...
[09:04:19] <Urchlay> hard to capitalize anything when everything is ALWAYS CAPS ALL THE TIME anyway
[09:04:31] <Keshl> Yes. <.<
[09:04:38] <Keshl> Quite thankful of that. <.<
[09:04:50] <darwin> the 'God' of the Abrahamic texts is Satan
[09:05:10] <KaMii> lol
[09:05:18] <Keshl> It's still 3 letters long, appearntly God thinks His name is God, so it's always getting caplitized.
[09:05:19] <Keshl> End of.
[09:05:31] <Keshl> Now can we please move back to something more productive, oÉo?
[09:05:36] <KaMii> yea.. i dont belivieve in him

[09:50:01] <KaMii> test #8 keeps re-running
[09:50:02] <Urchlay> I wish we could merge the two. Use the script & sets for the skiffy channel dune, with the cast of the david lynch one

[11:01:57] <KaMii> i seem to remember now that I use to have 8 gigs of ram in this machine and I had weird unstable issues
[11:01:59] <Crosma> memtest should report errors if the port is bad.
[11:02:04] <KaMii> pulled one of the ram chips out, never had an issue again
[11:02:50] <KaMii> but why would ram kill audio?
[11:03:39] nullby7e (~null@unaffiliated/nullby7e) left irc: Quit: disconnecting.
[11:03:40] <Crosma> Just depends on where that particular memory is being mapped.
[11:04:21] <Crosma> The sound driver may not support PAE correctly.
[11:04:22] <Crosma> Dunno.
[11:05:39] <KaMii> this makes no sense, why would you lose audio by adding ram
[11:06:57] Cultist (~Cultist@62.150.121.250) left irc: Ping timeout: 252 seconds
[11:07:20] <Crosma> Well, the sound card's memory would be mapped in the reserved 3.2G+ space, which you're trying to use if you're using PAE. PAE is supposed to make sure it all maps correctly though.

[11:20:58] <shonudo> no need letting that ram go to waste
[11:21:27] <KaMii> i might swap mobo's out
[11:21:44] <shonudo> you should identify the problem first
[11:21:51] <shonudo> you really do need to test those slots
[11:21:54] <KaMii> put this mobo in my media server, downgrade it to 4 gigs ram, put the servers mobo in this box and upgrade it to 12 gigs ram

[11:26:15] <shonudo> indeed
[11:26:22] <ventYl> so you'll see no errors

[12:32:14] <jerryzhou> i donot like ipadmini

[12:32:23] <d4wnr4z0r> the ipad mini is something jobs never allowed when he was alive.
[12:32:28] <jerryzhou> ist so expensive
[12:32:30] <Zordrak> Every Slack14 install I have seen with a default KDE setup will not show an icon on a firefox panel launcher either for a "web broswer" launcher, or a specific firefox launcher
[12:32:33] <Crosma> The iPad Mini is just pointless.
[12:32:42] <Zordrak> I would assume everyone else sees the same
[12:32:52] <Zordrak> and in that case, would assume there's a known solution

[12:34:44] <KaMii> Zordrak: i had my ff icon disappear in xfce, then i ran slackpkg upgrade-all firefox upgraded and problem solved.. funny thing is... i thought i did a removepkg firefox*
[12:34:45] <Zordrak> like quicklaunch, but in line with the Win7 redevelopment of "show launcher when closed"
[12:34:50] <pprkut> Zordrak: ok, so when you change the default web browser that launcher doesn't show an icon?
[12:34:51] <d4wnr4z0r> after first removing almost everything that's on the panel by default
[12:35:17] <Zordrak> pprkut: Precisely.
[12:35:33] <Zordrak> pprkut: But you can also right click on the bar of a running firefox to say "Show launcher when not running"
[12:35:39] <Zordrak> That also gives a launcher with no icon
[12:36:21] <pprkut> Zordrak: ok, I can try. I usually delete those launchers first thing after logging in the first time
[12:36:51] <Zordrak> pprkut: Normally I would use "Quicklaunch" widget.. but in this case the new launchers are actually more effective for me
[12:37:07] <Zordrak> pprkut: So would be nice if I can stop having to guess where I left the FF launcher ;)
[12:37:08] <pprkut> I just use icon widgets
[12:37:43] <Zordrak> Esp. given the integration with the right-click on the app's bar functionality to add and remove
[12:38:23] <pprkut> true, I did not know about that feature

[12:41:15] <shonudo> Zordrak, i haven't followed too closely, but is this only with ff?
[12:41:32] <shonudo> or is this a problem with other apps/icons?
[12:41:43] <Zordrak> only FF so far
[12:41:53] <Zordrak> no problem with TB, Konsole or Dolphin
[12:43:44] <d4wnr4z0r> this does sound familiar though, now that I think of it. I think it may be a known issue
[12:43:58] <shonudo> if it ends up being only ff, it changes from a kde problem to a ff problem i think
[12:44:33] <Zordrak> Sure, but whatever is at fault would like to track it down and resolve
[12:44:46] <shonudo> wait for the next ff release
[12:44:51] <shonudo> that should be any minute now

[12:47:01] <d4wnr4z0r> khtml's days of being awesome and spawning webkit are long past.
[12:47:43] <shonudo> so it's "formerly awesome dad of webkit"?
[12:49:03] <Zordrak> Unfortunately, konqueror is simply nothing like an appropriately usable browser, at least not for someone who does the things I do
[12:49:19] <shonudo> you know Zordrak, you wouldn't have this problem if you were on emacs
[12:50:02] <wood_quinn> Use rekonq
[12:50:12] <shonudo> hmmm... no flame
[12:50:18] <Zordrak> This isn't a huge problem, it's a minor niggle as I can always replace it with a quicklaunch widget, however if I can get it solved I would like to and can then also blog the resolution for other users of Slack14 if for no other reason than to help support those who dare to transition to Slack and then wonder why they bothered because of little things like this they cant solve

[12:51:19] <wood_quinn> It has to be amazing!

[12:52:28] <d4wnr4z0r> it could be.
[12:52:43] <shonudo> don't think so; it's more about the DE
[12:52:51] <d4wnr4z0r> it could be.

[12:55:32] <Zordrak> shonudo: Is there some reason why everyone on IRC these days is only interested in blaming something else? This problem is caused by FF and KDE having a mismatch in intentions and Slackware choosing to use this precise combination of FF and KDE versions. There is blame in all three. I do not care about blame. Blame is for morons who are not interested in solving problems. I care about finding, and then spreading to everyone else, the cause of
[12:55:59] <shonudo> you're going somewhere else with this, Zordrak
[12:56:08] <shonudo> nothing about "blame" at all
[12:56:19] <shonudo> it's about where the problem lies
[12:56:23] <d4wnr4z0r> well, since you already know the cause, then you must have already tracked the problem down and figured out how to resolve it, since there's no other way to know the cause.
[12:56:30] <shonudo> it's not a slackware problem, imo
[12:56:35] <shonudo> that's my opinion

[13:44:17] NightTiger (~derekm@tunnel.roaringpenguin.com) joined ##slackware.
[13:44:34] <Roin> which is probably a lot better than compiling xulrunner from source in sbo
[13:44:44] <hackedhead> ....   what?
[13:44:51] <hackedhead> Roin: i think that's terrible advice.
[13:44:54] <Roin> hackedhead: why?
[13:45:00] <Zordrak> pprkut: ok, cool thanks. FWIW I'm here when I can be.
[13:45:43] <Roin> you could also use a newer eclipse but oh well both ways seem fine to me

[16:35:52] <evanton> what's the correct way to disable IPv6 in Slackware 14.0?
[16:36:48] <hackedhead> you could probably just make a DENY rules for all ipv6 packets with the iptables tools (the ipv6 specific tool, that is)....
[16:37:22] <Skywise> blacklist the module
[16:37:35] <Skywise> or make a kernel without it
[16:39:38] lwulf (~lwulf@pppoe.178-66-39-209.dynamic.avangarddsl.ru) joined ##slackware.
[16:40:55] <evanton> hackedhead: actually by disabling IPv6 I'm trying to avoid exactly having a second firewall ruleset, even if it's just a couple of them
[16:42:19] <evanton> Skywise: I have tried having a file /etc/modprobe.d/ipv6.conf containing "blacklist ipv6", module still loads, I've also tried this http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/blacklist-ipv6-not-working-current-4175445136/#post4867812
[16:42:21] <hackedhead> it'd be two rules. DENY ALL for both directions.
[16:42:39] <evanton> after reboot, lsmod | grep ipv6 still shows the module is loaded
[16:42:44] <hackedhead> if i understand iptables correctly.
[16:43:10] <evanton> hackedhead: you do, but will this approach prevent applications to bind to a port over IPv6?
[16:43:47] <hackedhead> that i'm not sure about. fair enough.
[16:44:22] <evanton> hackedhead: that's why I want an IPv6-clean system, so a starting service won't even try to bind to IPv6
[16:44:26] <Alan_Hicks> evanton: You know you could just physically delete the ipv6 module and reboot.
[16:44:36] <evanton> Alan_Hicks: but that looks so ugly
[16:44:43] <hackedhead> "physically" lol
[16:44:55] <Alan_Hicks> evanton: That's only because it is.
[16:45:05] <evanton> Alan_Hicks: I really hope this isn't the recommended way :)
[16:45:21] <Alan_Hicks> hackedhead: Yes. You do that by opening up the hard drive and knocking out the section of disk with that module on it with a hammer and punch.
[16:45:38] <hackedhead> the correct way is probably "how i learned to stop worrying and love IPv6"
[16:46:09] Action: hackedhead begins rummaging in his toolbox for his very smallest punch.
[16:46:15] <evanton> I already did an ugly thing (which didn't work) - I added "modprobe -r" to /etc/rc.d/rc.local but it didn't help. Apparently the module gets loaded again at request
[16:46:28] <hackedhead> yup. automatic loading!
[16:46:38] <hackedhead> i'm surprised the blacklist doesn't work though....
[16:46:45] <n1x4> build kernel w/o... simple
[16:46:47] <Alan_Hicks> evanton: You could recompile your kernel without ipv6 if it bothers you that much.
[16:46:53] <Alan_Hicks> What's your reason for disabling ipv6?
[16:47:03] <hackedhead> which will be effectively the same as just deleting the module in the first place, no?
[16:47:05] <evanton> Alan_Hicks: recompiling the kernel would bother me more
[16:47:33] <Alan_Hicks> evanton: Then just rm ipv6.so
[16:47:50] Timslin (~speedy624@unaffiliated/timslin) left irc: Quit: Leaving
[16:48:05] <evanton> Alan_Hicks: I am trying to run a service which fails to run and isn't very log message friendly. So I want to exclude IPv6 since it binds only to certain ports (over IPv6) but not to all of them that it should
[16:48:22] <pi31415> some dumb programs listen on ip6 only by default if they find it
[16:48:23] <evanton> so I want to try running it on a pure IPv4 system first, to see if that would work as expected
[16:48:33] <mmlj4> hey, stay on v4, pretty soon there won't be anyone left on it to tell you you're missing out
[16:48:46] <pi31415> they can be configured to behave differently
[16:49:17] <evanton> mmlj4: I will consider to pay more attention to IPv6 at the very moment when my ISP gives me an IPv6 address
[16:49:24] <pi31415> +1
[16:49:28] <Alan_Hicks> evanton: Then just remove or move the ipv6 module and reboot. If it works, you know it's ipv6. If it still fails, you know to look elsewhere.
[16:49:30] <Nh3xus> same here +1
[16:49:32] <evanton> though, what you said could be applied to my ISP as well

[16:49:55] <hackedhead> better yet, mv the module so you can resotre it late
[16:49:58] <hackedhead> later*
[16:50:15] <evanton> Alan_Hicks: still, I remember that blacklisting via /etc/modprobe.d used to work a couple of slackware versions away
[16:50:20] <hackedhead> when it turns out that's not the real problem.
[16:51:01] <Skywise> can you mv or rm a module while its still loaded?
[16:51:10] <hackedhead> probably
[16:51:20] <hackedhead> it's probably in memory once it's loaded
[16:51:42] AtomPhil (uid6892@gateway/web/irccloud.com/x-vpvqauwcbqaxeyfa) left ##slackware.
[16:51:59] <evanton> I will try renaming the file if there aren't any better options
[16:52:11] <FLYSWATER> whats up Skywise
[16:52:24] <Alan_Hicks> Skywise: Yes. Once it's loaded into the kernel the old file isn't used anymore.
[16:53:07] <evanton> isn't .so a shared library, not a kernel module (which is .ko IIRC)?
[16:55:07] <evanton> renaming ipv6.ko worked (but I'll still tag this approach with the 'ugly' tag in my personal notes)

[20:24:47] <BrokenCog> Just asked this in #vmware, but thought I'd check with the experts, has anyone had a problem with ESX or Workstation or Vbox over-allocating disk space for VMs using journaling FSs? potentially twice as much??
[20:25:16] <smed> I have not.
[20:25:21] <smed> which JFS?
[20:25:27] <BrokenCog> clam
[20:25:29] <erikkugel> Well, I've seen snapshots in VirtualBox hog much more space than they could reasonable be expected to
[20:25:41] <BrokenCog> ...  claim is any ...
[20:25:49] <erikkugel> btw, JFS is an FS on its own
[20:25:52] <smed> *most* of my produciton experience with VMware/ESX has been for Windows guests unfortunately.
[20:25:54] <BrokenCog> snapshots are different.
[20:26:07] <smed> I'm familiar with IBM's JFS
[20:26:16] <smed> I should not have used that abbrev
[20:26:27] <BrokenCog> kleenex is a tissue of it's own, but i'll still ask you to pass the kleenex.
[20:26:44] <smed> right...
[20:27:24] <BrokenCog> okay ... I think what happened was the idiot pre-allocated the drive space and thought "
[20:27:42] <BrokenCog> "journalling FSs suck".
[20:27:43] <smed> ...thought that he used thin-provisioning?
[20:27:50] <BrokenCog> smed could be that also.
[20:28:03] <BrokenCog> but i'm not up on thin-* to know.
[20:28:06] <smed> I like how VMware does that.
[20:28:24] <smed> although I'm a couple years out of VMware practice now.
[20:28:25] mikef_ (~mikef@41.90.216.15) joined ##slackware.
[20:28:29] <BrokenCog> don't really know what it is about.  thin client stuff?
[20:28:51] <erikkugel> VMWare option when setting up virtual storage
[20:28:53] <smed> thin provisioning is a switch when creating the virtual disks....
[20:29:15] <BrokenCog> I have good experience with VM, once it's paid for :).
[20:29:31] <BrokenCog> s/VM/VMware/
[20:29:34] <smed> you create a virtual disk with a maximum size of 80Gb, but it only provisions a small percentage for the OS install and grows the file system as needed
[20:29:53] <smed> it works pretty consistently in my experience with Windows machines
[20:29:58] Iuz (~Iuz@unaffiliated/iuz) joined ##slackware.
[20:29:58] <BrokenCog> ah.  I thought that is what the dynamically allocated drive is?
[20:30:22] hpg (~hpg@p5B0A2A3F.dip.t-dialin.net) joined ##slackware.
[20:30:27] <BrokenCog> had realized it was called thin provisioning.
[20:30:34] <smed> maybe that's what they are calling it now
[20:30:43] <smed> I'm a couple years out of practice.
[20:31:00] <BrokenCog> I just know what the little check box asks in the create VM dialoge.
[20:31:18] <BrokenCog> doesn't refer to fancy tech terms like thin provisioning. ;0
[20:31:29] <smed> heh
[20:33:12] <erikkugel> ye, they have a big marketing department to rebrand everything into vmware specific terms. They they offer 3000$ training courses to explain what those terms translate to everywhere else.
[20:33:24] <smed> ikr
[20:33:54] <smed> I'm glad I'm not dealing with VMware anymore actually.....they went full-derp and started charging for everything
[20:34:29] <smed> then they got on Veeam about their "free" utility for performing hot image backups and then Veeam started charging an arm and leg for their products....
[20:34:40] <smed> every gets bit by the licensing bug.
[20:34:46] <smed> s/every/everyone/
[20:35:26] <smed> speaking of which - did everyone see how MS wants to charge $100/year for Office 2013?
[20:35:30] <BrokenCog> haha.  true.  well, everyone needs a buck. and that seems to be the "Web 2.0" lesson everyone learned; brand early and brand often.
[20:35:32] <smed> 5 device license
[20:35:59] <smed> this time next year, you'll have to pay to download LibreOffice
[20:36:03] <BrokenCog> hadn't, but that's the model the loud wants ... 100 a year seems a bit steep.
[20:36:17] <BrokenCog> smed: seriously don't give them ideas!!
[20:36:17] <smed> you can install it on 5 computers though
[20:36:29] <smed> it's really not that bad a deal....
[20:36:33] <kaleun> Well uh.. the better something is the more is costs, right?
[20:36:34] <BrokenCog> do i even use five computers?!?
[20:36:38] <smed> but it's contrary to what people will actually purchase
[20:36:55] <BrokenCog> cheap means ... cheap.  right.
[20:36:58] <smed> a family of 5 might have 5 computers
[20:37:02] <BrokenCog> true.
[20:37:07] <BrokenCog> maybe.
[20:37:13] <smed> in which case it's reasonably priced.
[20:37:22] <smed> or you could just d/l LibreOffice for free
[20:37:22] <kaleun> If all five people in a family are using that software then something is wrong.
[20:37:26] <BrokenCog> maybe they could all just agree to do the word processing on one?
[20:37:31] <smed> hah
[20:37:35] <smed> now that's funny
[20:37:43] <kaleun> Hm?
[20:37:49] <BrokenCog> funny as in very 1982
[20:37:59] <BrokenCog> eh, maybe 1983
[20:38:08] <smed> that's when we used to power-down our computers after we were done working with them

[22:46:35] <wood_quinn> You should be able to make a video DVD with files of any video format, provided your software supports it.
[22:47:05] <Skywise> as a matter of fact, you can do anything your software supports
[22:47:10] <wood_quinn> If the software is designed for Linux it should definitely support Matroksa.
[22:47:58] <wood_quinn> Point being, unless you're having a specific problem that's the best answer you're going to get.

[22:52:34] <Skywise> its completing the $
[22:53:02] <Skywise> but you can do it with any command it doesn't need to be rm
[22:53:06] <wood_quinn> fun one
[22:53:10] <wood_quinn> echo $_
[22:53:18] <mittens07> you dont even need a command you can just put $<tab>

[22:53:38] <wood_quinn> Really? Didn't know that.

[23:56:18] <Demon_Fox> Anyone know why par two makes two files instead of just one?
[23:56:51] <alisonken1home> what is "par two"
[23:57:44] <Demon_Fox> sorry
[23:57:45] <Demon_Fox> par2
[23:58:09] <alisonken1home> ok - what is "par2"
[23:58:30] <Demon_Fox> Generates ECC stuff for files
[23:58:30] <Skywise> its a parity file

[23:58:55] TommyC (~TommyC@unaffiliated/sepulchralbloom) left irc: Ping timeout: 264 seconds
[23:58:57] <Skywise> its for recovery, usually it generates one toc file and then a parity file
[23:58:58] <Skywise> you need it
[23:59:24] <Skywise> it also contains parity data
[23:59:58] <Skywise> basically if you have enough blocks, it can reconstruct the missing ones
