[01:17:40] <doug713705> If it works on Ubuntu then you should make it work on Slackware
[01:18:40] <Jdogzz> I tried:) From what I'm seeing I think I need very specific versions of packages in order for them all to play nice together.
[01:19:15] <Jdogzz> But I'm lost as to what those versions might be thanks to Ubuntu's ridiculous naming systems.
[01:21:36] <doug713705> why don't you install the latest one from source (you also _may_ need the latest kernel) ?
[01:23:05] <Jdogzz> I had tried the latest things from source but the problem with that is the latest libva package is a year or two older than the xvba package.
[01:23:34] <Jdogzz> So my guess is that it's so new it's dropped support for the much older xvba package somewhere along the line.
[01:24:02] <togermano> i think sex is overated
[01:24:03] <Jdogzz> And the latest kernel doesn't work with the fglrx drivers because my graphics card is only supported up to 3.4 I think.
[01:24:40] <doug713705> oh, is it an "old" ATI card ?
[01:25:06] <Jdogzz> Not super old, it's a Radeon 4000 card, but ATI has deemed it old starting with 12.8 and up of their drivers.
[01:25:51] <Jdogzz> And thus dropping mainline support. Their legacy driver is supposed to fix those problems but it's not doing so from what I've seen.
[01:26:58] <doug713705> I heard some things about old ATI based card than is no longer supported by ATI. But the worst of all it seems that it is impossible to make it work with newer kernels _and_ newer version of X11 (according to what I read somewhere on the net, the problem seems to be shared by the kernel and X)
[01:27:34] <Jdogzz> Exactly, I had to downgrade my Xorg packages just to make fglrx work on Slackware.
[01:28:14] <Jdogzz> It's ridiculous how new they expect your hardware to be, I'll the same card will be supported for the next 4 years in Windows-world.
[01:28:19] <doug713705> I don't know more about it. I left the only ATI I ever bought around 2004. I'll never buy ATI/AMD again.
[01:28:36] <Jdogzz> Do you use Nvidia or Intel now?
[01:28:47] <slacktivist> planned obsolescence, nothing new to the hardware world
[01:29:39] <doug713705> I use Nvidia for years with no problem at all. Actually I use a Nvidia optimus based laptop. Works like a charm but need to compile a bunch of package to make it work.
[01:30:39] <Jdogzz> It seems people are much, much happier with Nvidia's support of Linux, however small it is compared to the Windows driver.
[01:30:51] <Jdogzz> If only I'd known about linux before I bought this laptop:)
[01:31:14] <Jdogzz> Then I would have picked one with a different card and I'd be happily watching movies back on Slackware.
[01:31:23] <doug713705> To be honnest Nvidia make very good linux drivers but they'are closed source. That is a very bad point to them.
[01:32:10] <doug713705> The Nouveau driver seems to work well (never used it but people here and over internet seems happy with it)
[01:32:10] <Jdogzz> That cost them a pretty penny when some Asian company spent several million on AMD when Nvidia refused to let them have the source code.

[03:17:22] <BrokenCog> one sec.

[03:23:31] <BrokenCog> so, the secondary motivation to compile the current tree was to see If it would solve the problem of the packaged Wine has running Skyrim.
[03:23:35] <BrokenCog> haha.  clearly.
[03:24:18] <BrokenCog> clean as in ... ? not trammeled with multiple Mesa installs?  or something else?
[03:24:48] <macavity> bot multiple mesa installs, the version of libdrm that it originally came with, etc etc
[03:24:51] <macavity> *not
[03:24:56] <BrokenCog> the packaged Wine complians was complaining about the Radeon card not supproting Shader model 3 which it clearly does.

[03:25:44] <BrokenCog> right.  Well, I could removepkg them and re-install from my local 14.0 mirror ...
[03:25:53] <macavity> yeah, you probably need the blob for that.. not sure though
[03:26:10] <macavity> i have only compiled wine on intel hardware running off stock Mesa
[03:26:13] <BrokenCog> I tried both the open and propiatary drivers.
[03:26:14] <BrokenCog> same thing.
[03:26:26] <macavity> then that was probably a bogus error
[03:26:32] <BrokenCog> maybe.
[03:26:41] <macavity> which radeon is that?
[03:26:45] <BrokenCog> I was hoping if I compiled it all locally I could get somewhere past it.

[03:27:02] <BrokenCog> what is that ... 5670? hold on ...
[03:27:13] <macavity> ok, 5000 class
[03:27:25] <macavity> that is a very well supported card i belive
[03:27:31] <BrokenCog> I thought so ...
[03:27:52] <BrokenCog> the open driver ran really well ... I only put the AMD drive in to give it a try with Wine.

[03:28:23] <BrokenCog> Onec I get Wine compiled, I'll re-install and stick with the open drive ... unless I can figure out how to back out the ATI driver.

[03:35:31] <BrokenCog> maybe I was stoned.
[03:35:36] <Jdogzz> And that broke your system>

[03:35:37] <Jdogzz> ?
[03:35:51] <BrokenCog> no, I'm still stuck trying to build Mesa 9
[03:35:56] <BrokenCog> nothing's broke.
[03:36:05] <BrokenCog> except that configure/compile.
[03:36:16] <Jdogzz> That ends in an error?
[03:36:42] <BrokenCog> no, linking 64bit build against 32bit libdrm,radeon,expat.
[03:37:01] <BrokenCog> probabyl because I wasn't giving configure correct --with...
[03:37:24] <BrokenCog> I'll try one other time to install 9, then just use the installed 8.

[10:49:36] <Urchlay> nah
[10:49:48] <Urchlay> you're talking about wayland, I haven't looked at that yet
[10:50:27] <Urchlay> this is an older version of gtk+2, built with the directfb backend (normally it's built with x11)
[10:50:56] <Urchlay> newer versions, they quit maintaining the directfb stuff, and it got broken & never fixed. And there's no directfb in gtk+3

[10:59:31] <d4wnr4z0r> know what's even more frigging amazing? qt. :p
[10:59:35] <ventYl> KaMii: what was on december 23?
[10:59:50] <Urchlay> qt4 might really be awesome, except I don't like C++ because I suck at it, and I suck at it because I never liked it much
[11:00:02] <d4wnr4z0r> hehe
[11:00:20] <d4wnr4z0r> I wonder if there are go bindings yet.
[11:00:28] <KaMii> ventYl: wasnt the world suppose to end that day, the myan calendar thing
[11:00:36] <pink_mist> that was on 21st
[11:00:37] <Urchlay> anyway at some point I'll be attempting to build qt4-embedded for the framebuffer
[11:00:45] <KaMii> 21 23.. whatever
[11:00:47] <wood_quinn> Mmm. Qt.
[11:00:53] <wood_quinn> Because lock-in is fun.
[11:01:02] <KaMii> im on a weird insomina ting right now
[11:01:06] <Urchlay> at which point I should be able to compile qt apps against it, and use them without X too
[11:01:16] <ventYl> Urchlay: doing GUI stuff without OO is like chopping youself one leg in order to climb the hill
[11:02:00] <Urchlay> ventYl: well I won't argue that with you. gtk's API is "roll your own OO" in C, which has its warts

[11:03:18] <KaMii> that avatar movie suckd
[11:03:25] <Urchlay> well, I've actually used it with decent results. Written a couple of small gtk apps from scratch, and felt like I understood WTF I was doing
[11:04:00] <ventYl> KaMii: except that instead of missiles I fell from sky when I failed to perform correct type control
[11:04:06] <Urchlay> (the only other gui coding I've ever done was someone else's hand-rolled C++ mess that was implemented on top of SDL, *that* was hard to understand)
[11:04:41] <wood_quinn> Just give in and require KDE for every app you write.

[11:05:34] <Urchlay> nothing
[11:05:44] <d4wnr4z0r> indeed
[11:06:28] <Urchlay> ventYl: in gtk you mean? was that any worse than trolltech completely changing the API and build system, between qt3 and qt4? Either way, you have to rewrite your code...
[11:07:06] <d4wnr4z0r> at the end of the day GTK is a GNU thing.
[11:07:20] <d4wnr4z0r> thus it's a mess, it's a highly volatile moving target, etc etc etc

[11:08:52] <d4wnr4z0r> ah, was curious as I've never been able to bring myself to masochistic enough to try it...
[11:09:05] <Urchlay> it seems like an exercise in intellectual wanking
[11:09:08] <wood_quinn> d4wnr4z0r: Almost every Qt app I've used was designed for KDE.
[11:09:27] <Urchlay> of course, I could be accused of that (trying to get GTK apps to work without X? in 2013?)
[11:09:27] <wood_quinn> VirtualBox is the only notable exception that comes to my mind.
[11:09:32] <d4wnr4z0r> wood_quinn: and how is that relevant?
[11:09:32] <KaMii> qtip....
[11:09:44] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: FBReader is Qt only. So is qupzilla.
[11:10:02] <d4wnr4z0r> one qupzilla
[11:10:10] <wood_quinn> I said notable.
[11:10:13] <wood_quinn> Lol.
[11:10:21] <Urchlay> qupzilla counts as notable for me
[11:10:35] <Urchlay> and FBReader is "notable" to me because I actually use it pretty often

[11:10:47] <wood_quinn> Something counts as notable to me when more than a thousand people use it.
[11:10:55] <wood_quinn> And when it's been around for more than a year.
[11:11:08] <wood_quinn> In the tech world, that's a pretty lenient threshold.
[11:11:14] <Urchlay> also, there's qjackctl, which pretty much everyone doing audio production on Linux uses
[11:11:22] <d4wnr4z0r> true
[11:11:27] <Urchlay> more than a thousand, and it's been around for years
[11:11:50] <wood_quinn> But yeah, I get that there isn't a direct relationship between KDE and Qt, but every time I see that an app requires Qt I cringe.
[11:12:20] <Urchlay> it's the same relationship between GTK and gnome... except there seem to be fewer Qt-only apps than there are gtk-only
[11:12:23] <wood_quinn> I'm just waiting for the sound my hard drive makes when loading the part of the platters that house kdelibs which are otherwise never touched.
[11:13:09] <wood_quinn> Besides, I'm a fan of the GTK toolkit's default look.
[11:13:17] <Urchlay> actually I am too
[11:13:44] <Urchlay> well, *gtk2* default look. gtk3 looks awful to me without a theme
[11:13:57] <Urchlay> (but I don't use anything that uses gtk3 right now anyway)
[11:13:58] <wood_quinn> Qt looks like the illegitamite lovechild of Mac OS and a Flash-based website.
[11:14:32] <fuzzix> Hey now
[11:14:37] <fuzzix> Mac OS isn;t *that* bad
[11:16:41] <wood_quinn> More news on that activist's suicide. Perhaps good will come of all the attention.

[11:26:25] <Urchlay> it means, there's no correct answer to "What's your favorite color?"
[11:26:33] <KaMii> yes there is

[11:26:43] <KaMii> whatever color I tell you is your favorite
[11:26:44] <ventYl> "none?"
[11:26:44] <KaMii> lol
[11:26:46] <Urchlay> ventYl: your english is still better than my Latin
[11:27:04] <wood_quinn> Add latin in your argument, it makes you instantly right.
[11:27:05] <ventYl> Urchlay: that's not much possitive :)))

[11:27:32] <Urchlay> you use english every day probably, I've used latin not at all since high school
[11:27:50] <KaMii> your highschool teaches latin?
[11:27:56] <Urchlay> taught
[11:28:07] <Urchlay> 23-24 years ago
[11:28:15] <ventYl> i didn't used it much since ending of high school. nor for writing nor for speaking
[11:28:22] <wood_quinn> It was probably something "everyone would be using someday"
[11:28:25] <wood_quinn> Like metric.
[11:28:32] <Urchlay> what, latin?
[11:28:37] <KaMii> they only speak latin in romania, and still its a modern latin
[11:28:40] <Urchlay> no, they told us it was a dead language
[11:28:59] <wood_quinn> I thought they spoke Romanian?
[11:29:02] <KaMii> the metric system is great, it just makes sense
[11:29:03] <Urchlay> we were learning classical latin, as written (probably not spoken) by educated romans
[11:29:10] <KaMii> wood_quinn: well, romanian is just modern latin
[11:29:24] <wood_quinn> I thought it was ancient Romanian.
[11:29:24] <Urchlay> nobody knows how to speak classical peasant gutter latin
[11:29:38] <KaMii> nobody even knows the correct pronounciation of ancient latin
[11:29:42] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Neither did the classical peasants.
[11:30:10] <Urchlay> KaMii: well, that's because every time I get in my time machine, it doesn't take me where I want to go
[11:30:18] <KaMii> lol
[11:30:21] <KaMii> ok stewie
[11:30:22] <Urchlay> instead, it keeps returning me to the present
[11:30:41] <KaMii> Urchlay: do you have the shuffle button turned on?
[11:30:46] <Urchlay> in fact, it makes me wonder if the guy didn't just sell me a plain old phone booth with some blue LEDs on top
[11:31:01] <Urchlay> he was a Nigerian... is that bad?
[11:31:04] <KaMii> it doesnt even have a flux compasitor?
[11:31:05] <ventYl> Urchlay: what do you hear if you dial 911?

[11:32:42] <KaMii> something something... complete
[11:32:49] <wood_quinn> Urchlay: Upper crust as opposed to cavewoman?
[11:33:03] <wood_quinn> Or subterrenean?
[11:33:10] <KaMii> Urchlay: that was you calling?
[11:33:23] <Urchlay> "For threats to the fabric of space/time, press 1. For Dalek attack, press 2. If you've run out of tea, press 3."
[11:33:24] <ventYl> Urchlay: then you can be pretty sure at least that wiring is ok
[11:34:19] Action: KaMii always answers the phone by saying, 'Gallifreyan Emergency Service'
[11:34:38] <Urchlay> despite the label on the front... Officers and Cars do not, in fact, Respond Promptly
[11:35:14] <KaMii> its all relative to what each individual determines 'prompt' to mean
[11:35:15] <ventYl> prompt response is always relative
[11:35:24] <KaMii> ha!
[11:35:32] <Urchlay> KaMii: well, that explains why I thought I had the wrong number when I tried to make a donation to the KaMiinite Druid Church
[11:35:43] <ventYl> if you can get answer in just one month is relatively promptly compared to one and half year delay
[11:35:47] <KaMii> lol
[11:36:12] <Urchlay> actually, Kamiinite sounds like a good generic biblical tribe name

[11:38:11] <d4wnr4z0r> Urchlay: because it sounds like Canaanites, perhaps?
[11:38:19] <Urchlay> probably, yeah
[11:38:34] Action: KaMii prefers KaMiinian
[11:38:44] <Urchlay> wood_quinn: can I get a Jemimah's Witness T-shirt?
[11:39:04] <KaMii> or KaMiidic tribe of Goddess Worship
[11:39:17] <Urchlay> KaMii: your followers can't even decide on what suffix to add to your name? you're basically a non-starter, as a deity
[11:39:37] <KaMii> Urchlay: dont tell the secrets of my order

[11:43:17] <KaMii> fox can go to hell
[11:43:25] <KaMii> well.. we have to make hell exist first
[11:43:44] <d4wnr4z0r> hell exists. it is reserved for those who believe in it.

[11:44:06] <Urchlay> hell is the place where every good TV show gets cancelled to make room for more reality crap. So, eh, I guess they are hell.

[11:46:45] <KaMii> that was getting really really good
[11:47:11] <Urchlay> too much silly VR stuff, but it was at least starting to get interesting
[11:47:14] <KaMii> then scifi cancelled it because they figured scifi fans would rather watch wwe wrastling

[12:03:18] <ventYl> looking at someone failing is probably more appealing if you know it's "for real"

[17:36:51] <ananke> the UI is very different
[17:37:20] <shonudo> i think it's "clone" in the figurative sense of "me too!"
[17:37:23] <Skywise> when's the first time ms has done something original?
[17:37:31] <arfbtwn> ananke: yes, I know-but they're synonymous for most people, in the same way that GNU/Linux is Linux. I'm talking about stuff like sandboxing of processes, back stack, etc...
[17:37:35] <ananke> by that token, an android is a clone of 'me too'
[17:37:55] <nofra> Skywise: Xbox, Zune, Windows....
[17:37:59] <hackedhead> Skywise: windows phone/wind8 interface was pretty original, actualy....
[17:38:03] <hiptobecubic> the sad thing about windows phone 7 phone for windows is that it's not even bad
[17:38:16] <Skywise> windows wasn't orginal
[17:38:16] BitterPeter (~pedro@177.40.175.142) joined ##slackware.
[17:38:17] <shonudo> what i think it is is ms seeing something dominating the market and trying to figure out a way of changing that
[17:38:30] <ananke> arfbtwn: sandboxing has been around for a long time. and it's certainly not something that you can see just by 'looking' at it.
[17:38:35] <nofra> Skywise: :)
[17:38:44] <hackedhead> Skywise: the phone/metro tiles are pretty unique, no?
[17:38:51] <shonudo> heh
[17:39:07] <Skywise> that just means we haven't seen what it was copied from
[17:39:21] <hackedhead> i dunno how they are on a phone, on a laptop they're fairly annoying, but they are 'original' as fasr as i know.
[17:39:26] <hiptobecubic> i don't think they wanted to stop someone else from dominating as much as stop themselves from bleeding money out of their assholes everytime they touch anything that isn't Office.
[17:39:43] <hiptobecubic> They failed again, sadly, but Win7 Phone Mango Phone on Windows and Phones, is pretty good
[17:39:55] <hiptobecubic> just too late and with too much baggage
[17:39:56] <Skywise> no, i'm pretty sure their ambition was world domination
[17:40:10] <nofra> Skywise: Use to be
[17:40:11] <shonudo> pinky and the brain style
[17:40:16] <nofra> Now they are a kinder borg
[17:40:17] <hiptobecubic> well sure. On paper that's always the goal
[17:40:19] <arfbtwn> ananke: fair point, but no need to be pedantic about what you can/can't see. There was of course a review of the various things that make windows 8 great. Sandboxing was one of them, as was the back stack, and also a content retrieval/storage system which seemed too much like Android's content providers.
[17:40:21] <ananke> hiptobecubic: if you think about it, it's not just about not bleeding money. it's about making their products ubiquitous
[17:40:59] <shonudo> i'm wondering what the uptake of 8 in business and academia is going to be?
[17:40:59] <hackedhead> ananke: but they've already failed that in the phone market pretty badly.
[17:41:06] <hiptobecubic> ananke, sure. Which is what apple has now. But to do so they needed to make a product that people would buy "for fun" instead of because their boss requires it
[17:41:15] <shonudo> i don't see it offering an advantage in business
[17:41:16] <hackedhead> ananke: although xbox did come from behind to a pretty decent standing.
[17:41:17] <ananke> hackedhead: it's not the phone market. it's about home, office, living room
[17:41:17] <hiptobecubic> so they had to try
[17:41:22] <Skywise> i don't see win8 being widely adopted
[17:41:31] <hiptobecubic> although they never seem to do it correctly, XBOX360 not withstanding
[17:41:35] <Skywise> not in a commerical environment
[17:41:38] <hiptobecubic> orig xbox was garbage compared to ps2
[17:42:02] <hackedhead> hiptobecubic: objectively, sure, but it _sold_ which is mostly what matters...
[17:42:07] <shonudo> xbox's fate has been tied to halo since the start
[17:42:14] <Skywise> especially since its geared towards consuming multimedia and pecking, not productivity like a company would need
[17:42:17] <hiptobecubic> hackedhead, but not as much
[17:42:18] <shonudo> halo succeeded, xbox survived
[17:42:34] <hackedhead> hiptobecubic: true. but it was a suprisingly solid showing for a latecomer.
[17:42:35] <ananke> hiptobecubic: sure. but look at the trend now. with the consoles getting closer in terms of hardware, porting them across platforms is getting easier. and if a game can be available for both xbox and PC, that's more of a market for microsoft
[17:42:48] <hackedhead> shonudo++
[17:42:50] <hiptobecubic> shonudo, right. And halo was a lucky strike. there was nothing about xbox that made halo any better than it would have been anywhere else
[17:42:50] <arfbtwn> shonudo: gears I think continued their growth trend on the 360 quite a bit. Fantastic game...
[17:43:05] <Skywise> xbox games ported to the pc are simplistic, crude and lame
[17:43:07] <hackedhead> halo was better on the PC. =P
[17:43:11] <hiptobecubic> 360 is doing great
[17:43:19] <Skywise> the xbox can't compare with a pc gaming rig

[17:43:26] <hackedhead> no console can
[17:43:31] <hackedhead> that's not really fair.
[17:43:36] <hiptobecubic> no, but you forget that even the latest gen ones are several years old now
[17:43:37] <Skywise> i wish they would port the other way
[17:43:51] <hiptobecubic> Skywise, why would they?
[17:43:57] <hackedhead> Skywise: they cant for the reason you _just_ stated... performance.
[17:43:58] <arfbtwn> but i'm not forking out every few months for new equipment when my 360 will be fine for at least a year, maybe two...
[17:44:08] <ananke> in the end, whether it's xbox or pc, microsoft is earning money
[17:44:14] <hiptobecubic> arfbtwn, more like 4 or 5
[17:44:16] <Skywise> cause pcs are better performin and they don't ustilize any of it
[17:44:28] <hiptobecubic> Skywise, and if they did, then they would be locked in
[17:44:43] <Skywise> to dx11 or whatever
[17:44:47] <hiptobecubic> and consoles are way cheapaer
[17:44:49] <arfbtwn> hiptobecubic: I hope so :)
[17:45:06] <hiptobecubic> build a gaming rig with what it costs to buy an xbox360 and nothing more
[17:45:10] <hackedhead> Skywise: um... plenty of games do use it. even if it's just in the "no need to optimize" sense.
[17:45:20] <hackedhead> Skywise: which is still important for getting to market on a budget.
[17:45:37] <Skywise> nah, very few games can take advantage of multi core cpu and gpus
[17:45:50] <hackedhead> Skywise: i'm talking about the backend of the envelope

[17:47:21] <hackedhead> not enough ROI.

[21:11:52] <ananke> still, that wouldn't be the first question i'd be asking when i want to pick a firewall for a 'laptop' :)
[21:12:16] <core_saint> ananke, what would be the first question?
[21:12:44] <d4wnr4z0r> the first question might be: "do I really need this?"
[21:12:56] <core_saint> probably not
[21:12:58] <ananke> core_saint: what os will it run, and what do i expect out of it
[21:13:31] <core_saint> nothing really i guess just for sake of learning it... i guess i dont really need any firewall
[21:14:00] <core_saint> hmmm.... lots of guessing

[21:57:57] <calavera> I'm thinking about moving to Slack from Debian. Besides it's Unix philosophy, are there any other reasons to make the switch?
[21:58:52] <ananke> calavera: if you need to be convinced, then the answer is: don't
[21:59:24] <calavera> I'm just considering it. Maybe I'll just start with Salix.
[21:59:56] <ananke> if you want people's opinions to guide you, perhaps you should start by telling us why you want to move away from debian
[22:00:38] <calavera> I don't trust the package manager, and the general filesystem is a bit of a mess.
[22:00:54] <ananke> what do you mean by 'don't trust the package manager'?
[22:01:09] <NightTiger> calavera:  I use both Debian and Slackware. Each has strengths and weaknesses. It depends on what you want to do with your 'puter...
[22:01:44] <calavera> I get the feeling that it's installing bloat that there would be a better alternative to. I would just like to be able to research the deps and then make the choice myself.
[22:03:05] <eviljames> Well, here's the deal.  Slackware provides you with a rock-solid stable base.  The rest is up to you.
[22:03:21] <eviljames> There's nobody saying that bloat isn't present in Slack, hell, lots of people would argue that the whole KDE/ package set is bloat

[22:05:55] <NightTiger> calavera:  Debian does have a nasty tendency to include a lot of things because of dependencies, even if you will never use them. It's the price they pay for dependency management. With Slackware, it's up to you to decide what you want... Of course, then you have to be able to think...

[22:20:29] <eviljames> maybe that's just later Solaris that does it as such..
[22:21:01] <Skywise> why not just change their order in the search path
[22:21:23] <d4wnr4z0r> the compatibility is done via a thing that I don't remember what it's called just now, where the commands are hardlinked to this thing and it calls the real binary, either the 32 bit or 64 bit one as appropriate
[22:22:00] <d4wnr4z0r> but only for binaries where it actually matters, for those that don't really matter only the 32 bit version exists

[22:23:55] <d4wnr4z0r> eh, as long as you stick with the basics it all makes sense
[22:24:10] <Skywise> originally they were because you couldn't count on having all the parts of your file system up when you booted, so you prioritized things
[22:24:27] <Skywise> but we're along ways past that now
[22:24:32] <d4wnr4z0r> bin/sbin for requires binaries and requires system binaries, usr for normal user stuff, usr/local for local things, opt for vendor shit
[22:25:16] <Skywise> theres even a man page for it, but its still pretty arbitrary

[22:26:19] <Skywise> yeah
[22:26:50] <d4wnr4z0r> well it's all LSB/FSH stuff in there, not like on a real unix
[22:27:04] <d4wnr4z0r> some of which is accurate by tradition, some of which is, as you say, arbitrary
[22:27:12] <Skywise> i think there should be system files and user files, user files go in their home directory, system files go into their place from root
[22:27:39] nawcom (~nawcom@97-71-116-125.res.bhn.net) joined ##slackware.
[22:28:07] <Skywise> users shouldn't be making binaries to share, if its going to be used by more then 1, then root should install it, otherwise users just make stuff for themselves

[22:29:05] <d4wnr4z0r> except windows, which doesn't count
[22:29:54] <Skywise> so we dont need /usr or /sbin
[22:30:59] <d4wnr4z0r> you misunderstand. things in /usr aren't installed by usr, those are things can be, are you say, used by more than 1, and are therefore, as you say, root installed.

[22:40:05] <Skywise> i usually replace a system rather then upgrade it by the time it runs out of space
[22:40:07] <eviljames> Generally speaking, nothing and no one should be writing to /usr except root.  So, you make a canonical /usr and export via NFS
[22:40:36] <Skywise> i don't use nfs, i think its too fragile
[22:40:40] <eviljames> Now, all your machines have exactly the same userspace software running on them, but as long as the root fs is on the local machine with a populated /bin it should boot in case your NFS server is down.
[22:40:46] <Skywise> but i get your point
[22:40:54] <eviljames> It's certainly better than CIFS

[22:42:07] <eviljames> Ok, that's a fair and valid point.
[22:42:25] <eviljames> d4wnr4z0r: There was, at one time, a longstanding open bug with NFS on Linux (though, I believe it has since been corrected)
[22:43:08] <eviljames> d4wnr4z0r: The details were something like, in a multiuser scenario if two people open a file and both write to it, the NFS provider on the machine would cache the EOF location locally without re-polling.  User 1 overwrites User 2's data.
[22:43:16] <d4wnr4z0r> eviljames: I'm just saying that there are times where auth makes more sense, regardless of whatever bugs may exist in either implementation.

[23:00:03] <d4wnr4z0r> it's just another place to put home directories when /home runs out of space
[23:00:35] <thumbs> d4wnr4z0r: deprecated? Stop the nonsense?

[23:00:43] <d4wnr4z0r> thumbs: no?
[23:00:58] <thumbs> apache httpd is not deprecated.
[23:01:14] <alisonken1home> d4wnr4z0r: since when? last I checked it's still in slack - only the package name is changed to httpd http://slackware.dreamhost.com/slackware/slackware-current/slackware/n/httpd-2.4.3-i486-1.txt
[23:01:26] <thumbs> alisonken1home: the project name has always been httpd :)
[23:01:36] <d4wnr4z0r> alisonken1home: the package name is correct since the httpd is actually named httpd
[23:02:02] <thumbs> slackware shipped it as httpd, starting with version 2.0
[23:02:10] <alisonken1home> the daemon is httpd - the package is actually the sources from apache
[23:02:22] <d4wnr4z0r> I wasn't referring to slack specifically. just referring to the fact that much of the world is moving on to nginx, or other alternatives.
[23:02:29] <alisonken1home> thumbs: nit pick :)
[23:02:30] <thumbs> d4wnr4z0r: I beg to differ.
[23:02:34] <d4wnr4z0r> alisonken1home: but apache is a software foundation, not a web server

[23:02:54] <alisonken1home> d4wnr4z0r: nginx is good for static page speedups but apache is fine for other stuff as well
[23:02:58] <d4wnr4z0r> alisonken1home: apache's web server has been called httpd for years. see httpd.apache.org, etc
[23:03:45] <alisonken1home> the point being that apache is not deprecated yet
[23:04:08] <thumbs> nginx has and always had a niche market, yes.
[23:04:23] <d4wnr4z0r> I have considered it deprecated for some time now :)
[23:04:45] <d4wnr4z0r> and nginx can talk to php-fpm just fine; it is good for more than just static content.
[23:04:58] <thumbs> d4wnr4z0r: so can httpd.
[23:05:04] <d4wnr4z0r> wsgi as well, for the pythonites.
[23:05:13] <d4wnr4z0r> thumbs: never said httpd couldn't
[23:05:13] <thumbs> d4wnr4z0r: but nginx still only has a niche position in the market.
[23:05:41] <DarthEaron> im getting a 32gb ssd this friday... i have a 500 gb hdd with / and /home on two (roughly) 250GB partitions, and 5Gb swap. how can i move / to the ssd without losing data, right now data in use on / is less than 32gb. sorry for the long question.
[23:06:05] <Skywise> i still like my LAMP servers to be LAMP
[23:06:10] <d4wnr4z0r> thumbs: when one considers any position which is not apache httpd to be niche, that will always be true. it has a substanstial portion of the not-apache-httpd segment, though
[23:06:13] <thumbs> d4wnr4z0r: you might not like the software, but it's far from being "deprecated"
[23:06:44] <Skywise> is 32gb big enough for the whole os?
[23:06:50] <thumbs> Skywise: should be.
[23:07:12] <d4wnr4z0r> nonetheless, until the day that it actually manages to outperform nginx, I will continue to consider it deprecated, tyvm :)
[23:07:41] fisted (~fisted@unaffiliated/fisted) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[23:07:58] <Skywise> DarthEaron. then move everything to the 32gb, and mount the 500gb as shared storage somewhere, either has /home or in another place and leave the swap on your hdd
[23:08:07] <alisonken1home> Skywise: just watch /var/log

[23:08:45] <Skywise> alisonken1home, yeah logrotate would be a good idea on such a system

[23:12:12] <alisonken1home> thumbs: at the moment yes - but oracle is starting to close off mysql so I forsee a migration coming soon
[23:12:16] <DarthEaron> Okay so boot to live cd, format ssd to ext4, the issue "cp /media/hdd2/ /media/ssd1" format hdd to /home. What about the boot loader? why leave swap on the hdd?
[23:12:26] Last message repeated 1 time(s).
[23:12:26] <thumbs> alisonken1home: the margin will be reduced, I agree.
[23:12:32] <d4wnr4z0r> thumbs: mine is definition three of the linked page.
[23:13:01] <thumbs> d4wnr4z0r: would would make you a fanboy, I suppose.
[23:13:27] <alisonken1home> DarthEaron: main reason is ssd's wear out faster with that much writing
[23:13:53] <vanger> As someone who had to maintain a rlogin feature in a product, I really envy having a production environment in which something may be deprecated so easily.
[23:13:53] <alisonken1home> although if you're hitting swap all the time, better to get more ram
[23:13:55] <thumbs> even with enough writes, it'll take 10+ years to kill a good SSD drive.
[23:13:57] <d4wnr4z0r> thumbs: define it how you like. where maria is concerned, I choose to side with monty over oracle. where nginx is concerns, I choose to side with speed over age. does it make me a fanboy? I don't really care, as long as I can make sites run performably and stably.
[23:14:21] <Skywise> DarthEaron, you will have to edit your /media/ssd1/etc/lilo.conf to point to the new partition and then from /media/ssd1 run lilo -r
[23:14:53] gyroscope (~master@unaffiliated/gyroscope) left irc: Quit: WeeChat 0.4.0
[23:15:01] <NyteOwl> nginx is faster it seems but I prefer apache's configuration setup
[23:15:24] <thumbs> NyteOwl: again, it depends on how you test, and configure each, and the use case.
[23:15:51] <DarthEaron> so i could chroot to ssd1? edit, then run lilo -v ?
[23:15:53] <NyteOwl> thumbs: oh agreed. but speed not withstanding I don't like nginx's configuration emthod
[23:16:03] <Skywise> cpu is so cheap are you really i/o bound by your upstream bandwidth anyway
[23:16:10] <thumbs> NyteOwl: I've seen it once or twice, and it looked brutal, agred.
[23:16:13] <Skywise> DarthEaron, -r
[23:16:29] <alisonken1home> DarthEaron: there's actually a lilo option that does the chroot part so you only need to edit ssd lilo.conf then use the lilo option
[23:17:03] hpg (~hpg@p5B0A1D5B.dip.t-dialin.net) left irc: Remote host closed the connection
[23:17:12] <NyteOwl> as for teh database, I always kind areferred PostgreSQL
[23:17:12] <alisonken1home> DarthEaron: n/m - chroot would probably be easier
[23:17:25] <NyteOwl> s/sreferred/preferred/
[23:17:43] <d4wnr4z0r> NyteOwl: agreed, but more things work with mysql
[23:18:10] <NyteOwl> d4wnr4z0r: which is why my website sues MySQL heh
[23:18:22] <Skywise> for me mysql, apache, php have the most footsteps on any path i was going to take
[23:18:34] <d4wnr4z0r> and, when it comes to sheer performance (not counting the fact that your databases will get corrupted) mysql and family is hard to beat
[23:18:43] <alisonken1home> I prefer python to php, but whatever works

[23:23:15] <DarthEaron> slackware running xfce on a ssd is going to be insanely fast

[23:23:45] <Skywise> don't get too wound up
[23:24:02] <FLYSWATER> Skywise, I did fsck /dev/sda1 just now and it did its thing but it didnt fix it?

[23:24:34] <Skywise> did it fix anything?
[23:24:44] <FLYSWATER> well I didnt use -A?
[23:24:51] <Skywise> sata III is 6
[23:24:57] <FLYSWATER> I dont know if it fixed anything to be honest
[23:25:10] <FLYSWATER> I just think it ran threw it
[23:25:18] <Skywise> it will say when its changed anything or if it had found a problem
[23:26:01] <DarthEaron> lol i bought the currect drive like 3 or 4 years ago. IDE
[23:26:01] <NyteOwl> Ok,first I've seen of MariaDB. Why a fork of MySQL?
[23:26:27] <alisonken1home> NyteOwl: because Oracle bought mysql and lately there have been grumblings that Oracle is closing off mysql devs
[23:26:43] <Skywise> because of oracle's closed source addons, they provide the same functionality as the enterprise addons only its open source
[23:26:49] <alisonken1home> original mysql open sourcerers forkec mysql to mariadb
[23:27:16] <NyteOwl> alisonken1home: ok, but the MySQL codebase is already open source ... what's the point of starting a (for all visible purposes) identical project under a different name?
[23:27:27] <Skywise> because of oracle's closed source addons, they provide the same functionality as the enterprise addons only its open source
[23:27:29] <alisonken1home> NyteOwl: see Skywise post
[23:27:53] <NyteOwl> alisonken1home: yes but there is a community version without the clsoed soruce stuff ...?
[23:28:16] karel (~karel@unaffiliated/karel) left irc: Quit: leaving
[23:28:32] <Skywise> if you want the enterprise modules which aren't available for the community version, then you use mariadb
[23:28:51] <alisonken1home> NyteOwl: yep - but the closed source stuff is what makes the mysql enterprise edition work with the oracle stuff - so mariadb guys are replicating the enterprise stuff as open source mariadb enterprise stuff
[23:29:15] <Skywise> god help you if you need it anyway
[23:29:33] <NyteOwl> alisonken1home: ok but why not jst write them for inclusion into the community 4dityion of mysql? Seems more liek bruised egos than for any practicalality
[23:29:59] <jgeboski> or fork and call it a day with Oracle
[23:29:59] <Skywise> oracle could of done that if they wanted, and they don't want to
[23:30:11] <alisonken1home> not really - oracle _sells_ the enterprise stuff and are only making the mysql closed source additions to get people to migrate to oracle db
[23:30:11] <Skywise> jgeboski, thats about the size of it
[23:30:13] <slacktivist> because the mysql devs didn't want to do that.
[23:30:48] <Skywise> oracle didn't buy mysql to contribute to the community

[23:33:40] <Skywise> but you bleed money with oracle, did you wanna sort that column in descening order? oh you'll need to get the licence for advanced sorting on your server, how many seats will that be.
[23:34:04] <jgeboski> yeah, no kidding
[23:34:39] <jgeboski> and MySQL is in a way a competitor to Oracle's own database solutions (unlike the OpenOffice situation)
[23:35:11] <Skywise> it sure it, i'd of never used oracle if mysql had been an option

[23:38:07] <hpg> jgeboski, does it work on a desktop system, too?
[23:38:20] <Skywise> jgeboski, but i'm sure you can't find all of oracles configuration options in one place
[23:38:41] <jgeboski> hpg: yes
[23:39:03] <jgeboski> Skywise: makes sense from a money standpoint
[23:39:39] <Skywise> jgeboski, yeah, they follow the car dealer sales model, the initial purchase is only the beginning
[23:40:51] <jgeboski> also, their licensing stunt with JRE/JDK that prevents distros from distributing, it's just shit like that
[23:41:11] <jgeboski> granted, IcedTea/OpenJDK should be used, still kind of a low blow
[23:41:15] <hpg> jgeboski, thx, but then I will have to recompile my custom kernel again - debugfs is missing ;)
[23:42:04] <jgeboski> hpg: yeah, I don't use powertop (I have in the past several times), but I leave support for it out of my kernels as well
