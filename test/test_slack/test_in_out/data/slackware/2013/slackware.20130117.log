[03:23:07] <wood_quinn> It's completely related.
[03:23:09] <Skywise> no
[03:23:19] <Skywise> i'm sure the player can let the ball fall to the ground
[03:23:34] <wood_quinn> It's an acceptable neural pathway that's been hardcoded into their brain.

[03:23:51] <wood_quinn> Consequences don't make habits or addictions.
[03:23:52] <Skywise> nice try tho
[03:24:00] <wood_quinn> The compulsion to to them does.
[03:24:00] <Demon_Fox> smoking is an addiction, and smokers putting two fingers up to their face all the time is habit?
[03:24:16] <Skywise> theres no compulsion on the player catching a ball
[03:24:23] <wood_quinn> Sure there is.
[03:24:29] <Skywise> they catch the ball because thats advantageous in the game
[03:24:43] <wood_quinn> Just like there'd be a compulsion to dodge it if someone whipped it at their facce.
[03:24:50] <Skywise> but if you said don't catch a ball for now, they'd have no problem letting them fall all around them
[03:24:59] <Skywise> thats not a habit
[03:25:02] <Skywise> thats a reflex
[03:25:11] <Skywise> cause you don't wanna get hit in the face
[03:25:11] <wood_quinn> There's no difference between the two.
[03:25:17] <Skywise> theres quite a bit
[03:25:28] <wood_quinn> And someone who's got an addiction doesn't want to not use.
[03:25:31] <shonudo> unless it's hockey and you're the goalie
[03:25:41] <Skywise> the reflex is to help yourself, the addition hurts yourself
[03:25:47] <wood_quinn> Anyway, you've brought no new information to the table, so I'll stop arguing.
[03:25:53] <Skywise> lol
[03:25:58] <Demon_Fox> Before we into nasty things like deep fried oreos . . . Anyone else hungry all of a sudden?
[03:26:06] <Skywise> your argument ran out of argument pages ago
[03:26:11] <wood_quinn> Not worth getting people frustrated.
[03:26:14] <shonudo> deep fried oreos?
[03:26:18] <Skywise> no, i just had some butter pecan ice cream
[03:26:20] <shonudo> ah... yuk?
[03:26:22] <Skywise> it was good
[03:26:44] <Demon_Fox> My grandmother always liked peanut butter icecream
[03:26:47] <Skywise> yeah, thats what people who aren't afraid of being buried in a piano case eat

[03:28:22] <Demon_Fox> Dman these text books are using modern examples
[03:28:28] <alisonken1home> I like peanut butter, mayonaise, and egg sandwiches myself
[03:28:34] <Demon_Fox> I see that weird oldspice ad in it.
[03:28:38] <alisonken1home> good luck trying to get the wife to make it though
[03:28:53] <Skywise> i know, if anyone finds out they'll lock her up
[03:29:08] <Demon_Fox> What about Tuna and relish sandwitches?
[03:29:17] <Skywise> thats not so odd
[03:29:29] <Skywise> i don't like it myself, my gf does
[03:29:53] <Demon_Fox> Make sure to use mouth wash before sex
[03:29:55] <alisonken1home> how about peanut butter, jelly, and bbq chip sandwich
[03:30:02] <Skywise> noes
[03:30:07] <Skywise> you almost had it right
[03:30:15] <alisonken1home> Demon_Fox: is that so you can tell which end you're kissing?
[03:30:23] <Skywise> now grilled peanut butter and jelly is good
[03:30:40] <Demon_Fox> I guess that makes sense
[03:31:51] <Skywise> grilled peanut butter and bananna is good too, you can even put chocolate chips and honey on it
[03:32:25] <Demon_Fox> "Ladies there are two ways we can solve this, but we don't have enough jelly for the first."
[03:32:33] <Skywise> see how that works, none of the ingredients are repulsive in the context
[03:33:31] <Skywise> i remember when jello fighting first came out, and i couldn't understand the point of it, then stripes came out
[03:33:55] <Skywise> i still didn't see the point but i knew what people were going after
[03:34:33] <alisonken1home> dang - can't remember stripes. I do remember bill murray from the commercials though
[03:34:35] <Demon_Fox> Perhaps they ran out of slippery substances and that was all they had.
[03:35:25] <Skywise> there was a scene in the beginning with john candy going to the jello fight
[03:35:36] <shonudo> i vaguely remember stipes, can't remember the jello
[03:35:59] <Skywise> don't make me you tube you
[03:36:28] <shonudo> well, it's either you making me or me just doing it...

[03:38:58] <shonudo> i remember now
[03:39:06] <alisonken1home> I've got a 12.0 install without gui, but it's somewhere else
[03:39:09] <Skywise> well i hope so, after i showed it to ya
[03:39:11] <TommyC> Skywise: up-to-date (well I know 11.0 is no longer supported, but I mean as up-to-date as possible)?
[03:39:18] <shonudo> heh, i was awy
[03:39:20] <Skywise> if you still didn't there would be something to worry about

[03:39:22] <Demon_Fox> damn youtube wants me to log in to watch mud restling.
[03:39:29] <Skywise> pick the 2nd link
[03:39:42] <alisonken1home> TommyC: last I checked slack is still supported back to around 8.0
[03:39:54] <TommyC> alisonken1home: That stopped last year in August.
[03:40:02] <TommyC> It's only 12.1+ now.
[03:40:06] <Skywise> TommyC, i use it as a firewall and test server, so the kernel is upto date and so are the packages, but i never upgraded it

[03:42:17] <TommyC> I wanted to see if Pat upgrades python versions or if he just keeps one version going
[03:42:39] <Skywise> you can just go back to the source of the earlier distros and see what versions and flags are there
[03:42:47] <Demon_Fox> A lot of distros are using multiple versions of python
[03:42:53] <TommyC> yeah, but I'd also have to look through patches/

[03:50:53] <FrankD> yeah thats my plan, theres already a cutout in the top so i might just make a new one

[04:48:23] <Zosma> There's plenty of GUIs for it.
[04:50:25] <TommyC> shonudo: I'm going to try that suggestion. Going to run Slackware 13.37 in QEMU, then use it's -redir option to ssh into it and see if I can upgrade to 14.0 safely.

[05:38:46] <BrokenCog> and now I get to go to bed ... laterz all.

[05:49:09] <wood_quinn> Anyone know of good software for drafting floor plans?
[05:49:39] <Skywise> no, all the ones i've tried have been pretty hokey, you could try dia
[05:50:06] <Cultist> I looked a while back, best I could find was qcad, which wasn't very good (for me, at least)
[05:51:35] <wood_quinn> Well when I say drafting floor plans I mean "here's a wall, place the studs at 16" intervals and make it 6" wide"
[05:51:54] <shonudo> qcad is very good
[05:52:02] <wood_quinn> I think I tried qcad in the past but it doesn't do that.
[05:52:02] <shonudo> about as good as you'll find
[05:52:13] <wood_quinn> It's pure line-based drafting.

[05:52:32] <delt> Hello
[05:52:46] <shonudo> for 3D "the furniture goes here" floorplan apps, i think you're looking at proprietary stuff for windows
[05:53:00] <shonudo> i've used qcad + gimp with good results

[05:53:16] <delt> for realtime threading: instead of using pam, is there some command like "ulimit" that i can add to the login scripts or something?
[05:54:14] <delt> ie. what does pam do exactly, so i can replicate it and give my audio apps realtime priority as non-root users =)

[05:54:56] <wood_quinn> setcap
[05:55:40] <wood_quinn> If you put that into rc.local it would affect the binary for every user on the system. Use wisely.
[05:56:10] <delt> setcap, getcap - manpages aren't being very helpful.....

[05:57:19] <wood_quinn> I'll probably just go out and buy myself some large graph paper.
[05:57:24] <Skywise> unless you're gonna do engineering off it, you don't have illustrate 16" studs
[05:57:39] <Skywise> just use any line art software
[05:58:10] <wood_quinn> I already have the blueprint done, I just wanted to see how feasible it would be to build.
[05:58:13] <Skywise> if you wanted, you could use something like moray and then render your illustration with povray
[05:58:25] <Skywise> you need an engineering study for that
[05:58:42] <Skywise> that takes some expertise if i recall correctly
[05:59:05] <wood_quinn> Not really. Box-shaped buildings are easy to build. It's the roof that's hard :)
[05:59:41] <wood_quinn> It's a purely academic excersize though. I definitely don't have the money to build it.
[05:59:42] <Skywise> i'm sure there are standards for your area
[05:59:51] <Skywise> for things like snow load and wind
[06:00:10] <wood_quinn> We have tornados here.
[06:00:20] <KaMii> he have hippies here
[06:00:21] <wood_quinn> Great big wintry snownados.
[06:00:30] <Skywise> you can't construct anything tornado proof
[06:00:32] <KaMii> great big wintry hippies
[06:00:35] <shonudo> no roofing for hippies
[06:00:45] <KaMii> lol

[07:28:38] <KaMii> or oracle told them to fork off, so they did

[07:31:12] <tsccof> if you are working on one
[07:31:56] <d4wnr4z0r> oh, as part of an illumos distribution that I've been working on a bit, I'm creating a package manager for that as I don't much care for the readily available options

[07:34:04] <tsccof> and let's be honest, no package manager to this day has done everything it could possibly do, in its domain of concern, in a perfect way, things could be improved, there are many projects, few major ones, still with some dust around the corners
[07:34:05] <d4wnr4z0r> honestly, not really :)
[07:34:29] <d4wnr4z0r> I have very different opinions about this subject and it would not be productive for us to work together.

[07:53:07] <d4wnr4z0r> bad answer. use a different delimiter.
[07:53:39] <systemd_suxX> d4wnr4z0r, I haven't tested bu I am quite sure this worked for me once
[07:54:02] <d4wnr4z0r> systemd_suxX: it will work. it's also highly error-prone and very hard to read.
[07:54:11] <tsccof> using another delimiter makes it easier to read
[07:54:11] <BlueBonzoid> it looks right though u can use | or _
[07:54:11] <tsccof> yeah
[07:54:20] <d4wnr4z0r> changing the delimiter to | or # is far easier
[07:54:28] <tsccof> can you use _?
[07:54:48] <d4wnr4z0r> probably
[07:55:11] <d4wnr4z0r> should be able to use just about special character as a delimiter, with some limitations
[07:55:13] <tsccof> you can! it looks very readable   's_some/path_some/other/path_g'

[07:58:14] <tsccof> yeah
[07:58:38] <MarianoMariachi> hello, I was here yasterday and I had a grub problem and I did what you guys/gals suggeteed but the system failed to boot. I accessed the system from bootable usb and got the menu.lst and the grub.cfg file into pastebin. the system is in software raid and it has md0-4 where md0 is /boot and md1 is the /
[07:58:40] <tsccof> perl can be readable and "unreadable", but there's no proper good point for making things less readable.. i'll just use _
[07:58:49] <MarianoMariachi> http://pastebin.com/r1Lm2svR
[07:58:55] <MarianoMariachi> http://pastebin.com/TvV6b3WW
[07:59:10] <d4wnr4z0r> even hard-to-read perl can be read. the same rules always apply.
[07:59:42] <MarianoMariachi> if I am correct menu.lst tries to chain boot into grub.cfg and then from there it tries to boot a non existing kernel
[08:00:00] <MarianoMariachi> the kernels in the /boot are from 31-41
[08:00:15] <tsccof> d4wnr4z0r: hence the quotes around "unreadable"
[08:00:15] <BlueBonzoid> trying to reverse engineer sourcecode that just says hello world... and its like looking at an encrypted dump
[08:00:40] <MarianoMariachi> that is 2.6.32-31-generic-pae to 2.6.32-41-generic-pae
[08:01:05] <MarianoMariachi> and grub.cfg tris to boot into 2.6.32-30-generic-pae which does not exist
[08:01:11] <systemd_suxX> different delimiters will work for sed but not in other cases e.g. bash. Therefore people should get used to escape with backslashes and if you always do so you are also getting better in reading that code
[08:01:23] <BlueBonzoid> my problem with slackware is it runs my videocard too hot
[08:01:31] <MarianoMariachi> will I fix the problem if I change the grub.cfg and tell it to boot into 2.6.32-41-generic-pae ??

[08:03:32] <tsccof> yes, press 'e' and have fun
[08:03:49] <systemd_suxX> d4wnr4z0r, so you escape blanks with quotes in your scripts? This might break things if using a different shell then bash...
[08:04:00] <doug713705> this way you do not modify the grub config but xan try different possibilities

[08:05:28] <systemd_suxX> d4wnr4z0r, /bin/sh can also be ash, so what?
[08:05:41] <wood_quinn> That's why you use /bin/bash
[08:05:57] <wood_quinn> If they don't have it, the script will bail.
[08:06:04] <d4wnr4z0r> precisely. if your code is not sh-compatible, you set your shebang to whatever it is you're doing.
[08:06:15] <systemd_suxX> wood_quinn, look at your init scripts all of them are /bin/sh
[08:06:29] <tsccof> bang the shebang

[09:08:41] <ruskie> well there are a few forks of udev sans systemd
[09:08:50] <ruskie> frankly I don't have udev at all on my install

[09:09:34] <wood_quinn> Regardless of cuteness.
[09:09:42] <ruskie> which reminds me... still need to send a patch to workaround some udev specific behaviour in rc.S
[09:10:11] <systemd_suxX> ruskie, what is it, can you give details, please?

[09:10:22] <tsccof> gentoo forked udev
[09:10:34] <tsccof> debian devs thought it was a good idea as well
[09:10:43] <wood_quinn> Ah yes.
[09:10:53] <wood_quinn> Because I want those two groups developing udev now.
[09:11:08] <d4wnr4z0r> hah, right?
[09:11:14] <ruskie> systemd_suxX, details on?
[09:11:26] <wood_quinn> One distribution will only include makefiles and some flame stickers. The other will only release once ever four years.
[09:11:41] <systemd_suxX> ruskie, the rc.S behaviour your patch is addressing
[09:11:55] <ruskie> systemd_suxX, ahh http://sprunge.us/WOfT?diff
[09:12:01] <d4wnr4z0r> the debian distribution of udev will make suggestions about what other device nodes you might like to have, and will consist of multiple layers of symlink pools.
[09:12:15] <ruskie> systemd_suxX, basically it was setup to assume /dev is tmpfs and would fail to initialize lvm volumes if it wasn't
[09:12:25] <wood_quinn> d4wnr4z0r: But only for old hardware.
[09:13:11] <d4wnr4z0r> wood_quinn: that's okay, because the ubuntu fork will be just as broken as the debian version but will support newer hardware
[09:13:11] <wood_quinn> As a stability measure.
[09:13:19] <systemd_suxX> ruskie, well, did not experienced any issues with lvm on slack so far...
[09:13:30] <wood_quinn> d4wnr4z0r: Good, we're covered then.
[09:13:40] <ruskie> systemd_suxX, because you're using udev I take it
[09:13:45] phe (~phe@wikimedia/phe) joined ##slackware.
[09:13:47] <tsccof> let's stick with systemd if the forks are so bad then
[09:14:02] <ruskie> this is a no-udev lvm setup with a static /dev
[09:14:03] <systemd_suxX> ruskie, you don't using udev?
[09:14:10] <ruskie> no I'm not
[09:14:29] <wood_quinn> How does a static /dev handle hotpluggable things like USB drives?
[09:14:31] <ruskie> I don't want to edit a config file for things that I configure on the filesystem level like permissions etc...
[09:14:48] <ruskie> I don't care about hotpluggable things

[09:15:20] <ruskie> I have a few sdX and sdX# nodes created or I copy them from a /devtmpfs mount point
[09:15:46] <d4wnr4z0r> devfs?
[09:16:11] <tsccof> yes, it was devfs
[09:16:14] <d4wnr4z0r> that's what we had before udev replaced it.
[09:16:25] <ruskie> basically nothing changed much since then
[09:16:29] <ruskie> other than the naming scheme
[09:16:37] <ruskie> just where it's handled
[09:16:51] <tsccof> if you don't use udev
[09:16:58] <ruskie> I used it a few times
[09:17:01] <systemd_suxX> d4wnr4z0r, yes devfs, that ws somehow cool, I almost failed to understand the udev rules syntax very well...
[09:17:01] <tsccof> but you want to use a USB drive
[09:17:10] <tsccof> can you manually create a node for that?
[09:17:14] <ruskie> tsccof, yes
[09:17:23] <wood_quinn> What about the Mint version of udev?
[09:17:25] <ruskie> it's just a sdX and sdX# dev node
[09:17:35] <ruskie> dmesg will show you the device name
[09:17:39] <wood_quinn> It will be better because it's not the Ubuntu version.
[09:17:44] <ruskie> of course using devtmpfs makes it easy as well
[09:17:56] <ruskie> just have it mounted separately and copy the created dev node to your static dev

[11:06:14] <keepishop> pron == profit, and profit drives the internet. So pron is fine.
[11:06:29] <wood_quinn> Sure, but use one domain per purpose.

[11:18:16] <wood_quinn> I'd punch Bill Gate's twice.

[11:21:44] <keepishop> heh
[11:21:49] <wood_quinn> Considering it costs more than that to live.
[11:21:52] <keepishop> ....
[11:21:56] <d4wnr4z0r> no it doesn't.
[11:21:57] <keepishop> I make 3 times my rent
[11:22:00] <wood_quinn> Anywhere else in the states it's good.
[11:22:11] <tsccof> I think's good, not sure about how things work in the USA though
[11:22:26] <wood_quinn> Making three times your rent just means you couldn't afford to buy.
[11:22:32] <d4wnr4z0r> there are plenty of coasts where it's cheaper to live than it is in Cali.
[11:22:37] <keepishop> I am working on buying a house now.
[11:22:49] <keepishop> I'm in WA. Not CA.
[11:22:59] <keepishop> CA is FUCLKINGEZ expensive.
[11:23:12] <d4wnr4z0r> then I have no idea what your cost of living is like and my guess is null and void.

[14:09:40] <ananke> systemd_suxX: in usa most of the time you get a plan that pays for the phone in installments, so you don't pay the full price up front
[14:10:21] <ananke> i can see why an organization would be providing blackberries. BB has an entire ecosystem for managing phones in a business environment, deployment/configuration/etc
[14:10:58] <Cultist> US military uses them as well, but we're moving to either Android or iPhone soon
[14:11:12] <Cultist> so BB will be losing a large corporate customer then
[14:12:06] <ananke> BB has been on the losing end of things. they just haven't changed their business model to keep up with times. hell, they could have created a set of business apps for android/iphone
[14:12:15] <systemd_suxX> ananke, unfortunately the phones running maemo/meego are not bundled with those plans, so you get only an android one or iphone or blackberry... If you want a device running a real Linux system like maemo/meego you have to get the phone for the full price yourself...

[14:18:57] <systemd_suxX> ananke, don't tell me linux is not usable on mobile plattforms,  it was running on 200MHz single core CPU machine without big performance issues and nowadays smartphones are GHz multicore ones...
[14:19:13] <hackedhead> systemd_suxX: when you find some way of a) interacting with said system that doesn't suck and b) can do any kind of real build work without depleting the battery the device runs on, i'd love to hear about it.
[14:19:37] <hackedhead> until then: happy dreaming.
[14:19:54] <ananke> systemd_suxX: this has nothing to do with how fast a processor is
[14:20:16] <systemd_suxX> hackedhead, onscree keyboard and touchscreen, all it needs is a mobile platform GUI, the rest will be ok
[14:20:38] <systemd_suxX> ananke, so what are the draw backs then if not performance?
[14:20:57] <hackedhead> systemd_suxX: onscreen keyboard are not suitable for any amount of actual work.
[14:21:10] <ananke> we want phones to allow us to make/receive calls, text messages, check e-mail, run whatever applications we need to do our jobs. and do it efficiently, without fighting the UI or running into problems
[14:21:29] <hackedhead> and preferably lasting more than a few hours on a charge.
[14:21:51] <ananke> yes, that's another issue. most of the andorid devices that were in our office, would drain battery very quickly
[14:22:36] <ananke> iphones lasted much longer. if i have to recharge a device before the day is over, then it doesn't meet my needs as a mobile phone
[14:22:55] <ananke> so don't get me wrong. we use linux on vast majority of our servers.

[14:30:56] <systemd_suxX> if the GUI launcher (=sense) ghardlocks the underlaying OS (=kernel+toolbox+davlik) then the design of the OS is bad implemented IMHO, on Linux X may crash but it rarely locks the whole system
[14:31:33] <systemd_suxX> on android you can't even kill your own processes you started, WTF!

[14:42:53] <pprkut> but doing well with something like windows 8 for example

[14:45:54] <ananke> nofra: why do you think windows 8 would be a disaster?
[14:46:10] <hackedhead> eviljames: yah. my wife hates it on her new laptop.
[14:46:32] <eviljames> pprkut: Inexplicable behaviour shifts (ie: between desktop and metro modes), impossible to find options that should be pretty obvious (ie: Add Account in Windows Mail)
[14:46:47] <nofra> ananke: Because 1) The UI is too different from Vista. 2) He's an old guy ALREADY having problems remembering how to do things in Vista. 3) Win8 would collect just as many viruses.
[14:46:48] <ananke> i think when approaching win8 one has to separate it into two major issues: OS itself, and the new metro UI
[14:46:54] <systemd_suxX> ananke, windows IS a desaster - no matter which Version. ;-P
[14:47:03] <eviljames> Watching my bro-in-law use win8 was really an eye opener - I figured that it would be painful for power users, but actually a bit better for average users
[14:47:05] <ananke> systemd_suxX: seriously, don't get retarded
[14:47:10] <eviljames> just on grounds that metro *is* a simpler interface
[14:47:36] <ananke> nofra: for the metro UI, i highly recommend 'classic shell'. that will make your life much easier, if you are used to the old interface. metro UI makes more sense on a touch interface
[14:47:42] <eviljames> ananke: Those are both pretty major issues
[14:48:03] <eviljames> Can Metro apps (read: everything in the Windows app store) run in the desktop shell?
[14:48:19] <eviljames> Also, in the desktop shell there's no start menu
[14:48:24] <eviljames> so you're back to switching paradigms
[14:48:25] <ananke> nofra: as to your second point, i'm not sure i agree. windows 8 comes with antivirus out-of-the box, and it defaults to not allowing you to run random binaries from the internet

[14:49:07] <ananke> eviljames: i don't think metro apps can run without the metro UI [as in, not full screen, etc]. if his application set includes only the items he was used to before, that wouldn't be an issue
[14:49:08] <eviljames> ananke: Microsoft's track record on security for these matters leaves a little bit to be desired.  Wasn't there a windows bug that allowed remote code to be executed when sending data to a _closed_ port not terribly long ago?
[14:49:17] systemd_suxX (~zenwalkus@212.172.219.242) joined ##slackware.
[14:49:19] <ananke> eviljames: uhmm, classic shell gives you the start menu
[14:49:24] <eviljames> No, it doesn't.
[14:49:31] <eviljames> Oh, wait, classic shell != desktop mode
[14:49:42] <eviljames> sweet, _3_ varying ways to use win8.
[14:49:44] <pink_mist> http://www.classicshell.net/
[14:50:09] <ananke> eviljames: if you notice, i was recommending using classic shell for the UI, when compatibility with the previous paradigm is desired
[14:50:15] <pink_mist> ... once I've moved some data off a hdd, I'm just about to try to install win8 actually
[14:50:28] <ananke> so yes, out of the box it doesn't have a start menu, but with classic shell you can get that functionality
[14:50:53] <eviljames> So you've got to add a binary downloaded off the net to make it useful?
[14:50:57] <ananke> eviljames: and the remote code being sent to a closed port? that sounds like something from very long ago. i do remember lots of old netbios issues
[14:51:08] <pink_mist> eviljames: that's always been true of windows though :>
[14:51:16] <eviljames> ananke: Nah, that was something like last year

[14:51:49] <ananke> eviljames: if you can find more details on that bug, i'd be interested in reading about it. i don't recall anything that recent
[14:52:10] <ananke> now, on the flip side, windows 8 is faster and lighter.
[14:52:21] <eviljames> ananke: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms11-083 Here's the MS bulletin from 08-Nov-2011
[14:52:24] <eviljames> "The vulnerability could allow remote code execution if an attacker sends a continuous flow of specially crafted UDP packets to a closed port on a target system."
[14:52:33] <ananke> eviljames: cheers
[14:52:34] <eviljames> Their definition of _closed_ is apparently different from mine.
[14:52:42] <pprkut> eviljames: I said 'like Windows 8'. With that I meant a desktop with large rectangles, easy to identify, etc
[14:52:58] <eviljames> pprkut: I actually thought I would reject metro outright, but I'm learning to like it.
[14:53:07] <eviljames> Live Tiles aren't horrible
[14:53:21] <eviljames> IE10 is, as expected, an abomination.. but a worthwhile one for a change.
[14:53:33] <eviljames> Because with IE10 sucking so bad, it motivates people to get apps into the Windows store

[14:55:18] <eviljames> err, we'll continue this later - I gotta go to work
[14:56:06] <ananke> eviljames: yes. and it's a very unfortunate scenario. however, it is a usable workaround. i wish microsoft provided that functionality
[14:57:12] <ananke> it would certainly be a big step towards adoption of win8 in enterprise. as it stands, a lot of organizations will shy away from it
[14:57:59] <hackedhead> the issue with 'metro' is that it effectively creates two ditinct areas where you have programs
[14:58:23] <hackedhead> 'metro' apps are not equivalent to thier desktop counterparts, and it's awkward.
[14:58:47] <smed> 2 is not always better than one
[14:59:11] <hackedhead> it took several tries to get the basic skype app for desktop, since the metro version requires you to link it to your MS account.
[14:59:16] <hackedhead> which we didn't want to do
[14:59:40] <ananke> yep. also, not every internal windows software has been fully converted to the metro UI. for example the control panel. you have to dig through the old one to find lots of items
[14:59:44] <hackedhead> and _some_ behaviors flip you between metro and desktop apps, which is super-jarring.

[15:00:12] <hackedhead> click on a pdf download in desktop mode chrome or IE ->  loads metro PDF reader app....   >_<
[15:00:16] <ananke> hackedhead: and the skype app doesn't have all of the normal functionality yet. for example, you can't send files through it
[15:00:29] <hackedhead> ananke: yeah, they're effectively not even the same app
[15:01:04] <ananke> but as far as i can tell, skype doesn't put out the normal desktop app for windows 8
[15:01:12] <hackedhead> ananke: at first i thought i could just launch it in 'desktop mode' (like chrome, which installs both versions during the install) but you can't, it's a different download and isntaller for skype....
[15:01:25] <hackedhead> ananke: they do, it's buried in the site.
[15:01:41] <ananke> ahh, i'll have to dig for it
[15:01:42] <ananke> thanks
[15:01:53] <hackedhead> ananke: iirc, we had to login to the skype website, and then you can dig around for desktop mode version
[15:02:22] <hackedhead> which makes it a terrible experience.

[15:41:35] <Nh3xus> nkleus : Your usb dongle might be recognized by the kernel out of the box. If it's not the case, you will need to do some workaround with ndiswrapper

[15:43:29] <nkleus> oh ok i'll try that
[15:44:00] <nkleus> also, my other user name in here is kullix, are we allowed to have 2 names in here on 2 different pc's? just making sure
[15:44:29] <fuzzix> nkleus: rules link is broken, have at it ;)

[15:45:06] <nkleus> oh this one? yeah i have too
[15:45:51] <nkleus> i just made this one 2 seconds ago lol
[15:47:22] <nkleus> since i already have integrated wireless working on here now, im guessing the kernel (if it does pick it up) will read the usb wireless adapter as wlan1?

[16:20:23] <K4k> /var/ftp/pub is root:root, however and 755
[16:20:38] <K4k> is there a way to make the script run as root?

[16:21:40] <pink_mist> if it's a bashscript that calls mkdir and such to actually create the directory, no, mkdir won't be setuid
[16:22:04] <K4k> ok
[16:22:10] <pink_mist> write a script in a language that has builtin capability of creating a directory
[16:22:26] <pink_mist> and chowning it too
[16:22:50] <pink_mist> (or write it in C or something and compile it)

[16:24:08] <K4k> cmyster: would that not require manual intervention?
[16:24:31] <K4k> The purpose of the script is so that anyone can login and be sure they'll have an ftp directory
[16:24:33] <cmyster> not if your sudoers file is set up in a certain way
[16:24:40] <cmyster> oh
[16:24:51] <K4k> Skywise: I want them to have the ability to have a public ftp space as well
[16:24:57] <Skywise> do you have to create the directories on the fly?
[16:25:03] <cmyster> then no, create it once as root and forget about it. if it is not there, alert. imo its much safer that way
[16:25:20] <BrokenCog> anyone know of a tool for xterm|variants which 'greps' content scrolling in realtime and flashes or gives some other sort of notice?   I do this manually by highlighting content via grep, then scrolling back to find, but I'd like a notification that I -should- actually scroll back to look for, and best, jump to it.
[16:25:21] <K4k> Skywise: it would be cumbersome if I had to get a phone call every time a user needed an ftp directory created

[16:26:41] <K4k> brilliant*
[16:27:17] <Skywise> it should be simpler that way
[16:27:37] <K4k> Skywise: the trouble with making it when the user is created is that we use an ldap server. The ldap directory is populated by periodic syncronization with our AD server
[16:27:57] <K4k> The user homedir is created at first login with oddballd
[16:28:08] <K4k> er...oddjobd
[16:28:31] <K4k> but it still listens to /etc/skel, so that might work
[16:29:07] <Skywise> you can test it pretty quickly

[16:29:26] <K4k> can /etc/skel create directories outside of the users' homedir though?
[16:29:48] <Skywise> i was looking for constraints about that
[16:30:22] <K4k> because I know I could put the symlink in there, but that's not the part of the script which is malfunctioning
[16:31:36] <Skywise> yeah, it might just copy files to the user's home directory

[16:34:06] <Skywise> k4k, now one thing you could do is make the ftp directory the user's home directory and then that would be created when the account is
[16:34:41] <K4k> but anonymous ftp users can only see what is in /var/ftp/pub
[16:34:52] <K4k> and part of this is to give users two ftp locations
[16:35:02] <K4k> one that they can place a file for public consumption
[16:35:21] <K4k> the other would be ~ where they can keep things locked up for themselves
[16:36:05] <Skywise> you can also do that with permissions
[16:36:19] brainvision (~brainvisi@host153-85-dynamic.2-87-r.retail.telecomitalia.it) joined ##slackware.

[16:49:55] <K4k> This is just a temporary stop gap to provide a means of transfering large project files from the office to an on-site location
[16:50:05] <K4k> Skywise: yes, I said cloud XD

[16:55:06] <K4k> We don't have to do that with regular mail. If I choose to archive my snail-mail for > 6 months, it does not suddently become searchable without a warrant.

[17:51:02] <eviljames> cmyster: There are lots of other places where i7 is a good idea outside of VMs.  Multimedia work, higher-end number crunching and so on..
[17:51:16] <cmyster> true
[17:51:31] <cmyster> but for basic plus gaming, there is no need
[17:51:36] <eviljames> Sure, people who are buying i7 macs are likely wasting the power, but they're still (in terms of performance) the best buy on the market today.
[17:51:55] <eviljames> pft gaming.  Go buy an xbox or wii or whatever and use your computer for computing.
[17:52:10] <FLYSWATER> yep
[17:52:17] <cmyster> your opinion...
[17:52:19] <gnisho> derp?  sjnce when have Macs been able to beat a build-your-own whitebox on bang for the buck?
[17:52:34] <cmyster> I have been playing on the PC since the 80s and fine with that.
[17:53:08] <cmyster> preferae it even
[17:53:25] <pink_mist> gnisho: since never. they have usability features that may make it worth the extra money though .. I think eviljames meant that the i7 was in terms of performans the best buy on the market
[17:53:38] <pink_mist> +spelling
[17:54:08] <FLYSWATER> a mac i7 is the best buy on the market
[17:54:10] <FLYSWATER> :(
[17:54:35] <cmyster> depends on the OS and what you are running on it
[17:54:43] <cmyster> an XP wont know how to use it ;)
[17:54:50] <gnisho> I'm not going to argue about the worth of the extras, as that will change from person to person and for one person over time, was thinking in terms of raw performance there.  mr. eviljames' statement seemed a bit open for interpretation there.

[17:55:42] <gnisho> okilie!
[17:56:28] <eviljames> But yeah, the i7 is (imnsho) the best performing chip on the market right now, price be damned.
[17:57:36] <cmyster> eviljames: that goes to almost every uyser. if your work depends on terrible (in biblical terms) computing powers then the i7 suits you. otherwise an i3 can be an overkill for some users.

[17:58:20] <eviljames> cmyster: basically, Android tablet.
[17:58:39] <pink_mist> or a chromebook
[17:58:43] <pink_mist> those look delicious

[20:05:57] <smed> eviljames - I know...but for a n00b it's a mouthful

[20:06:17] <smed> not like sendmail.cf but you know what I mean.
[20:06:20] <NoFriends> smed: Not really, you just copy and paste someone else's
[20:06:23] <eviljames> THAT is a good enough reason not to use it.

[20:11:20] <NightTiger> NoFriends:  that's not as hard as it used to be. Sendmail out of the box doesn't relay. It used to...

[20:12:59] <eviljames> kullix: Just use Google Apps.

[20:15:45] <kullix> trust me, their technology is awesome. fascinating. i'll admit thatr
[20:15:50] <thumbs> gmail is by far the most reliable and scalable email solution
[20:16:01] <thumbs> hosted gmail domains is fine
[20:16:06] <NightTiger> If you relay using Sendmail, you make an entry for a specific domain, e.g. TO:example.com RELAY  and if they use you as a relay:  Connect:192.168.46      RELAY

[20:22:59] <smed> Pat Metheny FTW
[20:23:09] <Skywise> yes, that is classic
[20:23:11] <NoFriends> My cat plays jazz everytime he walks across the piano
[20:23:24] <Skywise> thats a cool cat
[20:23:28] <NoFriends> He is
[20:23:32] <smed> poor Kenny G's asshole must have been sore for a year after that.....
[20:23:42] <smed> I almost felt sorry for him.
[20:23:51] <Skywise> nah, he's too vain to believe anyone elses opinion about him
[20:23:57] <smed> until I remember the $ he made peddaling that crap
[20:24:07] <Skywise> he's a ham
[20:24:19] <smed> *was* a ham
[20:24:24] <smed> not sure he's done anything lately.
[20:24:25] <eviljames> Hey, I'm also too vain to believe anyone else's opinion about me.  Me & Kenny  G have something in common!
[20:24:28] <Skywise> is he dead?
[20:24:36] <eviljames> we can hope
[20:24:40] <Skywise> thats not all you have in common
[20:24:47] <Skywise> but we don't discuss it here
[20:24:54] <smed> well, I played the Sax, but that doesn't mean he and I have anything in common.
[20:25:07] <Skywise> he blows the sax
[20:25:13] <smed> he blows....
[20:25:18] <Skywise> exactly
[20:25:22] <NoFriends> s/the sax/at sex/
[20:25:25] <NoFriends> awwwww
[20:25:31] <smed> actually - I really liked the era when he played with the Rippingtons.....great band.
[20:25:34] <fuzzix> I'm waiting for the Kenny G / Yngwie Malmsteen collaboration record.
[20:25:47] <eviljames> fuzzix: Talk about the worst of both worlds...
[20:26:09] <Skywise> i like the rippingtons, but like pat says he's sharp an is always using gimmicks
[20:26:34] <Skywise> the only thing i ever hear about ygnwie is that he plays fast
[20:27:00] <smed> haha....I giggle every time I hear that Metheny interview....
[20:27:36] <Skywise> yeah, pat is the man
[20:27:41] <smed> Pat is the man.
[20:27:47] <smed> and I love Lyle too.
[20:27:54] <smed> damn fine pianist.
[20:27:59] <Skywise> yeah, i've got all his albums
[20:28:07] <Skywise> i like his first the most still tho
[20:28:09] <smed> oooh....you trump me big time.
[20:29:05] <smed> I think my earliest is American Garage
[20:29:06] <Skywise> his albums don't get much press, they win awards in categories that don't get announced
[20:29:35] <smed> Pat is *very* good at controlling his exposure, better than any musician that's been around as long as he has.
[20:29:35] <Skywise> oh i have all of pats albums too, but not all of his groups, i don't like the pat metheny trio
[20:29:42] <Skywise> i only have 1 of those
[20:29:54] <smed> I like PMG the best.
[20:29:56] <Skywise> i was saying i have all of lyle's albums too
[20:30:05] <smed> awesome.
[20:30:09] <Skywise> yeah pmg is the one
[20:30:26] <smed> my recent favorite is "Speaking of Now", I swear I wore out the CD
[20:30:51] <smed> Antonio Sanchez is fscking machine.
[20:31:50] <Skywise> i also like pat and jack dejonette
[20:31:54] <Skywise> have you seen pat live?
[20:31:58] <smed> no - I have not.
[20:32:12] <Skywise> oh man, they are an experience and worth every cent
[20:32:13] <smed> he comes to New Brunswick NJ once every year or so....
[20:32:27] <Skywise> he has to be one of the best live performers i've seen
[20:32:31] <smed> a good friend of mine went last year or the year before....I should have got tickets.
[20:32:37] <Skywise> he's flawless
[20:32:50] <smed> not surprising.  Everything he does is scripted to the 9's
[20:33:00] <Skywise> the band is so tight, they match the recordings to a tee
[20:33:33] <smed> he's more of a freak about that than another favorite of mine, Donald Fagen
[20:33:36] <Skywise> you gotta see him in a good ampitheater, not some little box
[20:33:43] <Skywise> yeah i love those guys too
[20:33:49] <smed> genuis.
[20:33:50] <Skywise> they do an awesome show
[20:34:01] <smed> yep - seen them 4 times in recent years.
[20:34:04] <Skywise> i just say them a few years ago on the pay the rent tour
[20:34:24] <smed> and I thought initially, there is no way Steely Dan will be any good in concert - and boy was I fscking wrong.
[20:34:49] <smed> a long-time studio band can't possibly put on a decent live show......
[20:34:58] <smed> wow was I wrong.
[20:35:11] <Skywise> i saw both nights in philly, they did aja the first night and katy lied the next night

[20:35:47] <smed> two of my favorite albums of all time.
[20:35:48] <Skywise> oh it was so righteous
[20:35:51] <Skywise> yeah
[20:36:04] <smed> turns me into a 10 year old again.
[20:36:35] <Skywise> the show starts out with a dark stage and one of the back up singers is spot lighted and she walks forward to the stage where theres an old fashioned portable turntable on a stand
[20:37:14] <Skywise> she puts the needle on the record and it begins to play some static as she walks back to her position
[20:37:28] <Skywise> and then the music hits and the lights blare on
[20:37:35] <Skywise> it was awesome
[20:37:41] <smed> wish I was there.
[20:37:42] <NoFriends> wow, it's almost like I'm there...
[20:37:58] <Skywise> they played every cut on the album straight thru
[20:38:02] <Skywise> its one of my best experiences
[20:38:05] <smed> I recall my first Dan show, they did "Dr Wu", I was blownTF away.....

[20:38:48] <smed> music today sucks.
[20:39:04] <Skywise> yeah, they do a real solid show, i had great seats too, right in front of the sound box
[20:40:05] <Skywise> in comparision it does, but even steely dan can't do it as good as they used to, i'm not a big fan of morph the cat

[20:40:32] <Skywise> yeah, thats a good one
[20:40:38] <smed> and "H-gang"
[20:40:42] <smed> the rest of it sucked.
[20:40:45] <Skywise> yeah, that'd be it
[20:40:52] <smed> sorry to say.
[20:41:02] <smed> but hey.....even old rockers need to die eventually.
[20:41:03] <Skywise> it seems like he was trying to hard to be quirky
[20:41:08] <Skywise> too hard
[20:41:09] <smed> yeah - doesn't work now.
[20:41:21] <smed> NightFly is IMO Donald Fagens best work.
[20:41:23] <Skywise> he's gotta ease up and let it flow
[20:41:40] <smed> Kamakirad is also good....
[20:41:45] <Skywise> yeah, i like every cut on that, but i like kamakiriad even tho it was different too

[20:42:54] <Skywise> on the other hand, do not get walter becker's albums

[20:43:19] <smed> agreed....
[20:43:30] <smed> I think his real talent is in production.

[20:43:49] <eviljames> i like turtles.

[20:48:09] <smed> I was a musician in my youth, if I continued into my working years, I'd be dead.
[20:48:20] <smed> bottom line....I could never handle the night life.
[20:48:26] <Skywise> its hard to make a living as a musician
[20:48:30] <smed> yep.
[20:48:44] <Skywise> even those with gigs struggle
[20:49:01] <Skywise> i know alot talented people who don't have any work

[20:49:34] <smed> yeah - even good musicians have a hard time finding work.
[20:50:15] <Skywise> yeah, they don't do the long tours like they used to, its 6 weeks a pop

[22:38:47] <NoFriends> It would be easier to load up Slack14 and not fight trying to get something to work on such an old release (IMHO)
[22:39:01] <t0f> this computer is maxed out at 512 megs of memory and i really don't feel like 4 upgrades and then discover that things don't work as i want
[22:39:18] <NoFriends> I'm running slack on a VM with less memory
[22:39:32] <NoFriends> 4 upgrades?  One upgrade
[22:39:46] <t0f> i'm dense i suppose, i tried to learn vm
[22:40:08] <NoFriends> Well, here's the answer then.  Don't know.  Prolly has some lib requirements that is gonna make your life hell trying to satisfy
[22:40:12] <t0f> are not upgrades still incremental?
[22:40:35] <NoFriends> again 12 is OLD
[22:40:57] <t0f> NoFriends: i had a feeling about 'lib hell' thanks
[22:41:30] <NoFriends> t0f try it but I think you're in for a world of pain
[22:41:46] <t0f> can i really go from 12.1 -> 14.0 in ONE upgrade?
[22:41:56] <Urchlay> no
[22:42:03] <t0f> i thought not :\
[22:42:14] <Urchlay> you can only do that if you blow it away and reinstall
[22:42:22] <t0f> right
[22:42:34] <t0f> i really like my 2005 system
[22:42:47] <NoFriends> t0f make a disc image of it with clone zilla
[22:42:51] <t0f> this 12.1 was upgraded from 11.0
[22:43:11] <NoFriends> Urchlay: That's the CORRECT way to upgarde
[22:43:13] <NoFriends> grade
[22:43:17] <NoFriends> upgrade
[22:43:18] <Urchlay> were you wanting qt4 for pute qt apps, or were you thinking of running kde4 with it? I don't think your p3 will run kde4 well...
[22:43:25] <NoFriends> That incremental stuff sux
[22:43:28] <Urchlay> s/pute/pure/
[22:44:00] <t0f> Urchlay: i found a beta lightscribe pkg that requires qt4
[22:44:13] <t0f> laCie won't work
[22:44:22] <t0f> it runs but
[22:44:39] <Urchlay> the other thing is... you'd have to build qt4 yourself. The qt4 packages for later slackware versions are just about guaranteed not to work on 12.1

[23:07:34] <TommyC> freetype in 12.1 was updated on the 15th

[23:07:43] <KaMii> 12.1 got its last security update in 2008
[23:07:46] <t0f> KaMii: when you say 'get updates' do you mean like automagically?
[23:07:58] <TommyC> s/15/16/
[23:08:06] <KaMii> well wait, no maybe it is getting updates
[23:08:23] Action: t0f is a dial-up
[23:08:28] <KaMii> no im looking at changelogs
[23:08:31] <TommyC> 12.1+ gets updates, 8.0-12.0 are the ones that lost support (not 12.1)

[23:08:59] <KaMii> oh, i was looking at the wrong line on 12.1 haha, 12.1 got an update yesterday
[23:09:20] <KaMii> i would suggest, grab the slackpkg from 12.2 repository, its just a shell script
[23:09:41] <KaMii> manually enter in a 12.1 mirror in /etc/slackpkg/mirrors
[23:09:49] <KaMii> and run slackpkg
[23:09:50] <t0f> i have 12.1 13.0 13.37 and 14.0 on disk
[23:10:02] <t0f> 12.2*
[23:10:49] <KaMii> just get the package and put it on your 12.1 install, and i would use that to keep up with the updates, you can also use it to upgrade your system if you feel like it
[23:11:25] <KaMii> i like slackpkg so I dont have to manually change the .new config files
[23:14:24] <t0f> i found
[23:14:26] <t0f> http://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware-12.2/slackware/ap/slackpkg-2.70.5-noarch-1.txt
[23:14:34] <t0f> install that?
[23:14:39] <KaMii> yea
[23:14:42] <t0f> ok
[23:14:49] <KaMii> if it doesnt work, just removepkg
[23:15:10] <core_saint> oh yes.... back to slackware :)
[23:15:11] <t0f> i have a backup in case i leak brake fluid :)
[23:15:31] <KaMii> then why not just go for broke and upgrade to 14?
[23:15:45] <t0f> KaMii: i am thinking of it
[23:15:48] pale3 (~marko@89-201-206-119.dsl.optinet.hr) left irc: Quit: Lost terminal
[23:16:09] <KaMii> i would upgrade to at least 12.2 just so you get slackpkg support
[23:16:19] <KaMii> 12.2 is nice, no kde4
[23:16:35] <KaMii> but if you *need* qt4 you should just upgrade to 14

[23:17:55] <t0f> it seems to run
[23:17:57] <t0f> # slackpkg
[23:17:58] <t0f> slackpkg - version 2.70.5
[23:19:02] <KaMii> the lightscribe software works in cli you know, it says the gui is just dependent on kde
[23:19:27] <t0f> if i run  slackpkg upgrade-all  it will upgrade all my 12.1 pkgs or will it upgrade to 14?
[23:20:03] <KaMii> t0f: it will only upgrade to whatever mirror you have selected
[23:20:15] <KaMii> so if you selected a 12.1 mirror, then it will just look for 12.1 updates
[23:20:28] <t0f> i'll have to read more about it
[23:20:41] <t0f> thanks!
[23:20:49] <KaMii> if you want to upgrade your system to 12.2 select a 12.2 mirror
[23:20:55] <t0f> i see
[23:21:07] <KaMii> http://www.lightscribe.com/downloadSection/linux/index.aspx
[23:21:13] <KaMii> they are .rpm and .deb
[23:21:42] <t0f> but at 4kbit per sec it would be much better to upgrade locally, i'm sure
[23:22:12] <t0f> KaMii: i have the rpm converted to tgz's and installed now
