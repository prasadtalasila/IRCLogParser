p79

p80
aS"[11:28] <t0by> _sev, I'm having a go at translating lang.ini in Italian\n"
p81
aS'[11:28] <_sev> yes, I knowm but what is the registry?\n'
p82
aS'[11:29] <t0by> _sev, "Please wait" or "We\'re crunching the latest data just for you!!111"?\n'
p83
aS'[11:29] <_sev> we are largely informal\n'
p84
aS'[11:29] <_sev> at least try to be\n'
p85
aS'[11:29] <t0by> In particular, do we want to use the first person plural?\n'
p86
aS'[11:29] <t0by> wait, though.\n'
p87
aS"[11:30] <t0by> In Italian it's kind of a big deal\n"
p88
aS'[11:30] <t0by> Using it tends to bring a heavy organic-2.0-hipster feel to it\n'
p89
aS'[11:30] <_sev> look at the news item about Cabal: https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm-web/blob/d353f190da1757d0f8af9635b06e39afce45ea57/data/news/20040401.xml\n'
p90
aS'[11:30] <_sev> in Russian I do use plural\n'
p91
aS'[11:30] <t0by> as opposed to "The ScummVM team" or something - third person\n'
p92
aS'[11:31] <_sev> out of respect\n'
p93
aS'[11:31] <t0by> To give you some context, the third personal plural was relegated to marketing material - nay, actual ads - until very recently.\n'
p94
aS'[11:31] <t0by> er \n'
p95
aS'[11:31] <t0by> first person plural\n'
p96
aS'[11:31] <t0by> you would very rarely find a first person plural on an instruction manual, for example, even of the informal kind.\n'
p97
aS'[11:32] <_sev> then this is the way to go\n'
p98
aS'[11:32] <t0by> It\'s started to creep in in the wake of the english "we"\n'
p99
aS'[11:32] <t0by> So, TL;DR\n'
p100
aS'[11:32] <t0by> do you want the hipster friendly feel or not?\n'
p101
aS"[11:32] <_sev> look, we're your friends who meet in a garage where you have stock of the old game boxes from your father\n"
p102
aS'[11:32] <t0by> Good.\n'
p103
aS'[11:33] <t0by> Thank you _sev \n'
p104
aS'[11:33] <t0by> Sorry if this sounds weird to ask\n'
p105
aS'[11:33] <_sev> not at all\n'
p106
aS'[11:33] <t0by> but it is a big deal in the language\n'
p107
aS'[11:33] <_sev> I know 5 languages, so I am very well aware of the differences\n'
p108
aS'[11:33] <_sev> *possible differences\n'
p109
aS'[11:34] <rootfather> we have a similar problem here in germany\n'
p110

p135
aS'[12:37] <rootfather> they are cause as soon as I do a simple "pull upstream master" on my local machine\n'
p136
aS'[12:42] <LordHoto> well, you can either ask git to rebase your changes onto upstream/master by using "pull --rebase upstream master"\n'
p137
aS"[12:42] <LordHoto> but, it's a kind of odd workflow to have changes like that in your master branch anyway\n"
p138
aS'[12:43] <LordHoto> what you usually do is create a new branch for a change set and then make your changes there\n'
p139
aS'[12:43] <LordHoto> then create the pull request from that branch\n'
p140
aS'[12:44] <LordHoto> (and usually there is no need to pull in anything from master unless you have conflicts)\n'
p141
aS'[12:44] <LordHoto> You might want to read up on feature branch workflow(s).\n'
p142
aS"[12:47] <Deledrius> Personally, when working on a feature branch, I do a rebase rather than a pull to put my changes on top of the current master's commits.  It avoids the merging, and still lets you resolve conflicts as part of your changeset.\n"
p143
aS"[12:49] <Deledrius> To remove those from your PR though, you can use a rebase -i and just remove those commits from the history and update the PR, is that's acceptable.\n"
p144
aS'[12:49] <LordHoto> Right, rootfather also wanted to know how to get rid of it them.\n'
p145
aS"[12:50] <Deledrius> *if that's\n"

aS'[15:38] <rootfather> thanks for all the hints about git :)\n'
p193

aS"[15:49] <rootfather> I didn't know that it's bad practise to make changes inside the master branch itself instead of using a seperate branch\n"

aS'[16:08] <snover> yes, finally. for some reason my username had an enforcer\n'
p201
aS'[16:09] <snover> i dont know who pretended to be me but i hope they did a good job\n'
p202
aS'[16:09] <Endy> It was a poor imitation.\n'
p203
aS'[16:13] <snover> thats too bad. i could use a good doppelgnger\n'
p204
aS'[16:15] <snover> i hope you are having a good holiday\n'
p205
aS'[16:18] <Endy> not bad thanks!\n'
p206
aS'[16:18] <Endy> back in 10, phone..\n'
p207
aS'[16:25] <Endy> Back.\n'

aS"[16:27] <Endy> UPS decided that it's battery test would run 60s longer and trigger batt_volt alerts.\n"
p213
aS'[16:28] <Endy> Israli tech managed to only brick one module last firmware upgrade, so yay that.\n'
p214
aS'[16:29] <Endy> "So, you\'ve got a spare in the truck?"\n'
p215
aS'[16:29] <Endy> "Oh, no spares in the country, we\'ll have to ship it from Jerusalem.\n'
p216
aS'[16:29] <Endy> "AWESOME"\n'
p217
aS'[16:30] <snover> sounds like a risky supplier\n'
p218
aS'[16:30] <Endy> snover: They are a top quality mob.\n'
p219
aS'[16:30] <Endy> So the vendor informed us, before later admitting we had the only unit of that range in production.\n'
p220
aS'[16:30] <Endy> Thanks guys!\n'
p221
aS'[16:31] <snover> do you get a discount for being user of a prototype?\n'
p222
aS'[16:31] <Endy> Oh.\n'
p223
aS'[16:31] <Endy> Well, this was the replacement they gave us for free...\n'
p224
aS"[16:31] <Endy> replacing the previous unit which blew one of it's modules weekly.\n"
p225
aS'[16:32] <Endy> They admitted that one was a prototype, but they would swap it (no charge, because they felt bad) for the unit they believe is the most reliable\n'
p226
aS"[16:32] <Endy> ... that they hadn't deployed anywhere.\n"
p227
aS'[16:32] <snover> mk ii\n'
p228
aS'[16:32] <Endy> Yep.\n'
p229
aS"[16:33] <Endy> This one isn't a prototype tho.\n"
p230
aS"[16:33] <Endy> It's at LEAST alpha..\n"
p231
aS'[16:33] <Endy> The original dud unit was a XP controller, this is a ubuntu one.\n'
p232
aS"[16:33] <Endy> But once we got them to fly a tech out from Home Orafice to apply the firmware the vendor said they didn't know how to (we sell embedded devices! Wots a JTAG?)\n"
p233
aS'[16:34] <snover> commodity os for critical power systems?\n'
p234
aS'[16:34] <Endy> I found a one-to-one match in the changelog and our internal bug tracker ;p\n'
p235
aS"[16:34] <Endy> snover: Controller is independant - the actual power stuff is all solid state and 'fail-safe'.\n"
p236
aS"[16:34] <Endy> snover: Proven by the fact I had to hard-reset the controller weekly because it's custom snmpd would lockup\n"
p237
aS'[16:35] <Endy> snover: The first time one of the contactors went into fail-safe with a big loud clunk... I shat my pants... :P\n'
p238
aS'[16:37] <Endy> snover: The best bug was snmpd reporting line input voltages of 2000V.\n'
p239
aS"[16:38] <Endy> snover: First time that happened I was at the deli down the street... looked over my shoulder and didn't see a big pulme of smoke so correctly assumed it was a bad reading ;p\n"
p240
aS'[16:38] <snover> that would have been a bad day at the office.\n'

p256
aS"[16:48] <eriktorbjorn> Endy: Coca? Coffee? Shouldn't that be tea, preferably Earl Grey?\n"
p257
aS'[16:49] <Endy> eriktorbjorn: Funnily enough, I was originally going to write.. "NYE Resolution - Start drinking Earl Grey" :)\n'
p258
aS'[16:50] <Endy> eriktorbjorn: Never actually tried it..\n'
p259

p267
aS"[16:55] <eriktorbjorn> Endy: I take it they don't have the US pilot episode of Red Dwarf, then? ;-)\n"
p268
aS'[16:55] <Endy> eriktorbjorn: No...\n'
p269
aS'[16:56] <Endy> eriktorbjorn: I had heard one was filmed with Craig and Charles IIRC, but never actually seen a copy..\n'
p270
aS"[16:56] <Endy> But I haven't at all been jaded by such hits as Office (US), Skins (US), and pretty much <EveryDecentUKDrama> (US)\n"
p271
aS'[16:57] <t0by> Coupling (US)\n'
p272
aS'[16:58] <Endy> Being Human (US)\n'
p273
aS"[16:58] <t0by> I don't even understand how that was greenlighted given that there wasn't a Sarah Alexander (US) available.\n"
p274
aS'[16:58] <Endy> ... etc etc. (Coupling was a prime example of *rage* :)\n'
p275
aS'[16:58] <Endy> lol\n'
p276
aS"[16:59] <t0by> It's actually funny because Coupling is a bit of a Friends (UK) in my book.\n"
p277
aS'[16:59] <t0by> Only - sorry, good American people in ScummVM - better.\n'
p278
aS'[16:59] <t0by> *in #scummvm\n'
p279
aS"[16:59] <Endy> t0by: That's the rule - you take a UK drama based around strong characters... and re-film it using Real Stars (tm)\n"
p280
aS'[17:00] <Lightkey> Whose Line is it Anyway? (US) was still great\n'
p281
aS"[17:00] <t0by> For what it's worth that kind of worked for Frasier.\n"
p282
aS'[17:01] <t0by> Except that it was made entirely of recycled characters\n'
p283
aS"[17:01] <Endy> Lightkey: Give me Ryan and Colin, and I'll forgive Drew cracking up at his own cue-cards :)\n"
p284
aS'[17:02] <m_kiewitz> Coupling is very good, loved that series\n'
p285
aS"[17:02] <Endy> (I've only seen a few of Aishas episoeds, but that lady can make anything sing. ARCHER!)\n"
p286
aS"[17:02] <t0by> David Hyde Pierce and Jane Leeves' characters were literally carried over from their previous shows.\n"
p287
aS'[17:03] <t0by> Little known fact: the main Coupling  writer went on to be showrunner for the Doctor Who reboot IIRC\n'
p288
aS'[17:03] <Endy> t0by: Second show-runner :)\n'
p289
aS'[17:03] <m_kiewitz> IT Crowd is also very good (the UK original of course, not the horrible US remake/shoot)\n'
p290
aS"[17:03] <t0by> Yeah, I don't watch Doctor Who, sorry.\n"
p291
aS'[17:03] <Endy> t0by: That\'s ok. You can say "The writer of Coupling went on to create Sherlock"\n'
p292
aS'[17:03] <Endy> :)\n'
p293
aS'[17:04] <Endy> m_kiewitz: I\'m glad Grahame didn\'t jump on the US-ificfation wagon. Imagine... "Black Books (US)" :P\n'
p294
aS'[17:04] <m_kiewitz> *shudder*\n'
p295
aS'[17:04] <Endy> quite!\n'
p296
aS'[17:04] <t0by> Sherlock (US), featuring Lucy Liu.\n'
p297
aS'[17:04] Action: Endy sniggers\n'
p298
aS"[17:05] <eriktorbjorn> t0by: I think that one's entertaining, if a bit repetitive.\n"
p299
aS"[17:05] <Endy> t0by: Are you a hollywood casting agent in disguise? It's uncanny! :)\n"
p300
aS'[17:05] <t0by> Endy, what?\n'
p301
aS'[17:05] <t0by> eriktorbjorn, I actually like it.\n'
p302
aS"[17:05] <t0by> But I've only seen the first dozen episodes or so.\n"
p303
aS"[17:06] <Endy> t0by: Featuing Lucy Liu. Sounds like whom they'd cast. Unless there's really a Sherlock (US) and I am blissfully ignorant..\n"
p304
aS"[17:06] <t0by> But yeah, it's a bit of a one trick pony.\n"
p305
aS"[17:06] <t0by> Endy, there is and it does feature Lucy Liu. It's called Elementary :P\n"
p306
aS"[17:06] <Endy> t0by: Oh yeah - I've heard but not watched. I didn't know it featured Lucy :P\n"
p307
aS"[17:07] <Endy> Now, why don't we see stuff like... Lost (UK)\n"
p308
aS'[17:07] <eriktorbjorn> I don\'t mind remakes in general. Until recently, I didn\'t know "Albert & Herbert" was a Swedish remake of Steptoe and Son.\n'
p309
aS'[17:07] <Endy> You know, the one where things actually make sense because blimey!\n'
p310
aS'[17:07] <eriktorbjorn> Endy: I thought there was, though it was called "The Prisoner". ;-)\n'
p311
aS'[17:07] <Endy> eriktorbjorn: Which is a remake of an Australian show called Jailbreak :)\n'
p312
aS'[17:07] <t0by> Endy, wait. You believe Lost was not a waste of precious film stock?\n'
p313
aS"[17:08] <m_kiewitz> eriktorbjorn: I don't mind it, when the source material was awful. When it was a masterpiece, then it makes no sense at all\n"
p314
aS'[17:08] <t0by> I firmly believe that if I filmed by buttocks for 20 weeks, edited the footage together and invented an implausible backstory for it, it would still be a better serial than Lost.\n'
p315
aS"[17:08] <Endy> eriktorbjorn: actually that's not the show i thought it was i guess.\n"
p316
aS'[17:09] <m_kiewitz> case in point: the Swedish "Lt den rtte komma in"\n'
p317
aS"[17:09] <Endy> t0by: No, the problem was the editor threw out the wrong cuts - the series had to be made out of the 'cutting room floor' leftovers.\n"
p318
aS"[17:09] <Endy> t0by: That's why we have a smoke monster made out of chains... or relays... or something.... \n"
p319
aS'[17:10] <m_kiewitz> or the Korean "OldBoy", or "IT Crowd" and so on\n'
p320
aS'[17:10] <Endy> "Pawn Stars - Chelsea"\n'
p321
aS'[17:10] <m_kiewitz> or that silly Psycho reshoot from 1998 with Vince Vaughn\n'
p322
aS'[17:11] <m_kiewitz> urgh\n'
p323
aS'[17:11] <Endy> "CSI: Cyber"\n'
p324
aS'[17:11] <Endy> .. oh wait, that ones real.\n'
p325
aS'[17:11] <Endy> :P\n'
p326
aS'[17:11] <eriktorbjorn> m_kiewitz: I don\'t remember if I saw the remake of "Lt den rtte komma in", but I did like the original movie.\n'
p327
aS'[17:11] <m_kiewitz> eriktorbjorn: avoid it at all costs, the US director had no idea what he was doing\n'
p328
aS'[17:12] <m_kiewitz> the original movie is a masterpiece, except maybe that cat scene, you know what i mean :P\n'
p329
aS'[17:12] <m_kiewitz> if you are interested how much they fucked up, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoIJzsyTxJg\n'
p330
aS"[17:13] <t0by> The only smoke monster in Lost was the substance *everybody* on the production clearly smoked in copious amounts. I really can't understand how that stuff was greenlighted in the first place.\n"
p331
aS'[17:13] <t0by> "Good morning sirs, I\'d like to pitch this treatment in which nothing makes sense and time warp and funny trees and smoke monster and they\'re actually all dead."\n'
p332
aS'[17:13] <snover> writer cop-outs\n'
p333
aS'[17:13] <t0by> "Sold! Here, have some money, find yourself a useless cast, a blind cinematographer and make some stupid sound effects in Ableton."\n'
p334
aS"[17:14] <eriktorbjorn> t0by: I enjoyed watching Lost, but I pretty much gave up hope about it ever making sense somewhere around season 3, I think. The way I put it was that it was well enough made that you could *usually* forget it didn't make any sense while you were watching it.\n"
p335
aS"[17:14] <t0by> eriktorbjorn, I don't remember it being a porno.\n"
p336
aS'[17:14] <Endy> t0by: See, they wrote the flash-forwards... then the writing room went location scouting and found a shitload of shrooms"\n'
p337
aS"[17:14] <t0by> That's usually how those work.\n"
p338
aS'[17:15] <t0by> LOL Endy \n'
p339
aS'[17:15] <Endy> The funny thing is I started watching lost due to a bet.\n'
p340
aS'[17:16] <t0by> Which you presumably... lost?\n'
p341
aS'[17:16] <Lightkey> <Endy> I actually won the bet\n'
p342
aS'[17:16] <Endy> The bet was: "I bet JJ Abrams simply cannot write a satisfying finale (nee: Alias)"\n'
p343
aS'[17:16] <Endy> Lightkey is correct ;p\n'
p344
aS'[17:17] <m_kiewitz> what was the bet? "I bet that it will make sense in the end"?\n'
p345
aS"[17:17] <Endy> Alias and Lost were both great premises - and if they were fleshed out past a one-page treatment before being pitched, might have actually had a 'story arc' :P\n"
p346
aS'[17:17] <t0by> "I bet if I deliberately vaporize myself with a super laser my life insurance won\'t cover it"\n'
p347
aS'[17:17] <Endy> m_kiewitz: "I bet JJ has no idea how to end this - he can\'t end series, look how he ended Alias"\n'
p348
aS'[17:17] <_sev> Endy: yo\n'
p349
aS'[17:18] <t0by> You mean he can *start* them?\n'
p350
aS'[17:18] <m_kiewitz> ah\n'
p351
aS'[17:18] <Endy> m_kiewitz: It was many years to collect that bottle of whisky :P\n'
p352
aS'[17:18] <Lightkey> <Terminator> are you a glutton for punishment?\n'
p353
aS'[17:18] <t0by> Sorry people but I had an hard time dragging myself to the end of the first *episode* of Lost.\n'
p354
aS'[17:18] <Endy> t0by: That sounds like a new wager - "JJ Abrams can write pilot episodes, but not a full arc"\n'
p355
aS'[17:19] <Endy> :P\n'
p356
aS"[17:19] <t0by> I am actually avoiding the new Star Wars movie because Abrams is on it. And I would have actually watched it if it were Lucas. You know, Jar Jar's dad. Draw your own conclusions.\n"
p357
aS'[17:20] <m_kiewitz> Well at least Lucas\'s Episode 1-3 were "original" and not a copy+paste of [spoiler]\n'
p358
aS"[17:20] <Endy> Yeah, but ironically I trust Disney with the francise more than lucas... they've shown they know the demographic by their well-planed EU cartoons.\n"
p359
aS'[17:20] <t0by> ...Akira Kurosawa?\n'
p360
aS'[17:20] <Endy> demographic is probably the wrong word, but me.\n'
p361
aS'[17:20] <Endy> .... then again, when I first heard the director of LOTR was Peter Jackson...\n'
p362
aS"[17:21] <t0by> Jackson's output before LOTR is solid\n"
p363
aS'[17:21] <Endy> all I could think is "Meet the Feebles.... with hobbits??"\n'
p364
aS'[17:21] <Endy> ... was disapointed ;0\n'
p365
aS"[17:21] <t0by> Then he ruined the Tolkien books for me. And I wasn't crazy over them in the first place.\n"
p366
aS"[17:21] <m_kiewitz> sure, i guess back then some editor saved star wars from being crap. I don't want to know what would have happened in case Lucas had full control over everything back then\n"
p367
aS'[17:21] <t0by> What m_kiewitz said.\n'
p368
aS'[17:22] <Endy> Must agree also.\n'
p369
aS"[17:22] <t0by> That's probably true of a bunch of dictatorships in their infancy as well :P\n"
p370
aS'[17:23] <Endy> People give dicators such a hard time.\n'
p371
aS'[17:23] <Endy> I mean, even Democracy needs a wing-man\n'
p372
aS'[17:23] <Endy> :P\n'
p373
aS'[17:23] <Endy> (also, *pushes glasses to tip of nose*... sheeple)\n'
p374
aS'[17:24] <m_kiewitz> and Disney will at least release the unmodified episode 4-6 on Blu-ray at some point, so Disney is already the better choice\n'
p375
aS'[17:24] <m_kiewitz> thank god\n'
p376
aS'[17:24] <Endy> Yep.\n'
p377
aS'[17:24] <eriktorbjorn> m_kiewitz: I believe that when I see it... and will hold on to my DVDs of the original versions in the meantime.\n'
p378
aS'[17:24] <t0by> Disney usually has a little problem with dubs.\n'
p379
aS'[17:25] <Endy> Disney have a fairly good track record of minimal-retconage\n'
p380
aS"[17:25] <salty-horse> so I ran include-what-you-use on scummvm, and I found a few headers that can be removed, but it's not that much of an improvement... wonder if I should submit it or just drop it. (most of the comments are about tons of headers that should be added, which I ignored)\n"
p381
aS'[17:25] <m_kiewitz> eriktorbjorn: you mean those non-anamorphic DVDs?\n'
p382
aS'[17:25] <t0by> They just have to redub everything with inferior voice artists and a broken script\n'
p383
aS'[17:25] <t0by> that\'s their usual solution to "crap, we\'ve lost the tapes for the 1947 Italian dub"\n'
p384
aS'[17:26] <eriktorbjorn> m_kiewitz: The ones that look much, much better than the VHS-taped-from-TV I watched back in the day, yes. :-)\n'
p385
aS'[17:26] <m_kiewitz> right, disney fucked up all sorts of Ghibli movies because "we have to re-dub all of those movies with famous hollywood stars"\n'
p386
aS"[17:26] <Endy> salty-horse: Sounds like a NOOP, but I'd post the output for feedback.\n"
p387
aS'[17:26] <t0by> Oh, so they do it at home as well\n'
p388
aS'[17:26] <t0by> I though it was their italian division that was stupid\n'
p389
aS"[17:27] <t0by> m_kiewitz, Endy you might want to check out Harmy's Star Wars releases\n"
p390
aS"[17:27] <m_kiewitz> eriktorbjorn: i thought about buying those, but non-anamorphic broke the deal for me. i'm quite sure that disney will release it. they have to get those 4 billions, and those blu-rays will surely give them another 500 millions or so\n"

p395

aS'[17:31] <salty-horse> there are a few cpp files that have some extra headers that can be removed, but meh\n'
p400
aS"[17:31] <m_kiewitz> yeah, Disney doesnt give a fuck. I know that. But they care about money. And re-releasing Star Wars in their original form will get them loads of money. they know that and that's why they will do it\n"
p401
aS"[17:32] <Endy> salty-horse: Yeah - not much there that wouldn't be either referenced or optimised out anway.\n"
p402
aS'[17:32] <t0by> ^^^ funny how this applies to Star Wars as well\n'
p403
aS'[17:33] <snover> eriktorbjorn: i dont see anything about that video that is not awesome\n'
p404
aS'[17:33] <m_kiewitz> it reminds me of Silent Hill nowadays. Was such a great series of games, then Konami let the original team go and then they made crappy games and crappy movies with lots of Pyramid Head fan service\n'
p405
aS"[17:33] <eriktorbjorn> m_kiewitz: By the way, since Star Wars Kinect was published by LucasArts, I'm going to consider this as canon. This is clearly what happens back at the Death Star in Return of the Jedi, during all those ewok scenes. ;-)\n"

p410
aS"[17:34] <m_kiewitz> eriktorbjorn: what's really infuriating is that they already had Star Wars Rogue Squadron trilogy finished for Wii. And then either Disney or Lucas or whoever cancelled it\n"
p411
aS'[17:34] <salty-horse> the scummsys -> config.h thing is silly. however, scummsys.h can mostly be replaced with common/types.h\n'
p412

p417
aS'[17:37] Action: Endy has flashbacks to linker reference ordering days of yore\n'
p418
aS"[17:37] <salty-horse> forward decls are good, as they prevent you from including shit you don't need. most of those in common/ were already fixed\n"
p419
aS'[17:37] <Endy> salty-horse: Yeah, likewise with the namespacing usages\n'
p420
aS'[17:38] <Endy> salty-horse: (maybe - depending on the function scope i guess)\n'
p421
aS'[17:39] <Endy> I guess the most productive removals are probably the sound stuff - seems to be a fair number refenced that are included from the core.\n'
p422
aS'[17:40] <Endy> #ifndef __ALL_THE_HEADERS\n'
p423
aS'[17:48] <salty-horse> common/file.h should add these lines: #include <stdio.h>               // for SEEK_SET\n'
p424
aS'[17:50] <LordHoto> salty-horse: It includes common/scummsys.h which should include stdio.h, so that looks odd.\n'
p425
aS"[17:50] <salty-horse> LordHoto, it doesn't like scummsys.h :) I didn't paste that :)\n"
p426
aS'[17:50] <salty-horse> it wants "config.h" for all the type stuff instead\n'
p427

p449
aS'[20:37] <_sev> sometimes overrun by forge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/forge/\n'
p450

p452

p453

p455
aS'[20:40] <_sev> to Trac\n'
p456
aS'[20:41] <Raziel^> hmm\n'
p457
aS'[20:42] <Raziel^> looks nearly the same as on sourceforge :-)\n'

p461

p469
aS'[20:59] <snover> wjp: people normally just create 90000 tags\n'
p470
aS'[21:05] <snover> it is too bad github have decided to spend all their engineers on atom, which meets or exceeds eclipse-levels of awfulness, instead of improving their garbage issue tracker\n'
p471
aS'[21:05] <_sev> funny, but these days I use atom for ScummVM hacking\n'
p472
aS'[21:06] <_sev> and looking forward to start using it at the daily job (replace Sublime)\n'
p473
aS'[21:07] <snover> have you tried vscode? its also electron-based but way less terrible at everything\n'
p474
aS'[21:07] <snover> in my experience\n'
p475
aS'[21:07] <_sev> vscode?\n'
p476
aS'[21:07] <_sev> you mean Windows thing?\n'
p477
aS'[21:07] <snover> https://code.visualstudio.com/\n'
p478
aS'[21:07] <snover> nope\n'
p479
aS"[21:08] <_sev> well, that's the thing I meant. Coming from Microsoft\n"
p480
aS'[21:08] <_sev> I thought it is Windows-only\n'
p481
aS'[21:08] <snover> nope\n'
p482
aS'[21:09] <_sev> well, it seems missing essential thing like rsync support\n'
p483
aS'[21:09] <_sev> I usually do rsync for the sources on remote server\n'
p484
aS'[21:10] <snover> source that are in git?\n'
p485
aS'[21:11] <_sev> nope, when I do development on my work, I have things running in a remote VM\n'
p486
aS'[21:11] <_sev> and keep the sources locally for speed\n'
p487
aS'[21:11] <_sev> so there are 2 essential commands: full sync with remote server when I do any git operation there, and copy file to the server on saving\n'
p488
aS'[21:12] <_sev> anyway\n'
p489
aS'[21:12] <_sev> tell me, why it is better than atom?\n'
p490
aS'[21:13] <snover> way faster and way less buggy\n'
p491
aS'[21:13] <snover> and much less resource utilisation\n'
p492
aS'[21:14] <snover> not that any webkit-based thing is going to be light on memory, but when i compared a while ago it used ~50% less memory\n'
p493
aS'[21:15] <_sev> well, so far I did not face any probems memory- and speed-wise\n'
p494
aS'[21:15] <_sev> what I like about atom is the speed of development\n'
p495
aS'[21:16] <_sev> also recently they finally implemented ligature rendering, so I am using Fira Code as a font\n'
p496
aS'[21:16] <snover> maybe its better now, but before speed of development just meant you have a chance of coming into work and your editor is broken today\n'
p497
aS'[21:17] <snover> anyway i am glad you like it but i personally would never switch back\n'
p498
aS'[21:18] <snover> and i could really use better issue tracking for other projects on github that i manage&\n'
p499
aS'[21:19] ny00123 (~ny00123@cbl217-132-129-134.bb.netvision.net.il) left irc: Quit: Leaving\n'
p500
aS'[21:28] <snover> oh yeah i forgot, atom also somehow managed to randomly corrupt files when i saved them\n'
p501
aS'[21:29] <snover> possibly related to being on sshfs but i have never had another editor have a problem with that\n'
p502
aS'[21:29] <snover> sometimes it would truncate, sometimes it would just append garbage data to the end\n'
p503
aS"[21:29] <_sev> that's defeinitely bad\n"
p504
aS'[21:29] <_sev> when did you try it?\n'
p505
aS'[21:30] <snover> i think i deleted it in october\n'
p506
aS'[21:30] <_sev> are you on Windows?\n'
p507
aS'[21:30] <snover> mac os\n'
p508
aS'[21:30] <_sev> I see\n'
p509
aS'[21:32] <snover> i cant imagine it working better on windows, ive had to fix some crazy bugs in libuv on Windows, like they didnt support \\r correctly\n'
p510
aS'[21:34] <snover> i seem to remember that the way that Atom Helper works is super weird too, like its a version of Node.js that responds differently if you have a certain environment variable set, but it doesnt work the same on Windows vs POSIX\n'
p511
aS'[21:35] <_sev> I was working on Windows last time seriously about 8 or 9 years ago, when I was forced to do it at one company\n'

aS'[21:02] <Raziel^> ah, yes, in the intro...sound mushup\n'

aS'[21:02] <m_kiewitz> im not sure if original sciAudio restricted it to 1 music track at one time, or if the original game acts the same\n'

p924
aS'[21:04] <m_kiewitz> ah there is a "playx" command and it means that it plays one type of each audio type only and stops the rest\n'
p925

aS'[21:04] <Raziel^> there is also a music oddity in the first room (space)\n'

aS"[21:13] <m_kiewitz> some of those could be script bugs, but 2 tracks playing at the same time is caused by ScummVM, because we don't use the sound class at all\n"

aS'[21:14] <m_kiewitz> or well, im not 100% sure. in theory this could also be caused by us. I think there is a command called "change", which isn\'t supported by ScummVM atm\n'

p944
aS'[21:14] <Raziel^> ;-)\n'

p956
aS"[21:24] <m_kiewitz> im not sure if that's the only way that it's supposed to work, or if you can write a string and also set the selector directly\n"

p1195
aS'[15:09] <m_kiewitz> in dosbox it does\n'

aS'[15:37] <lskovlun> if I set that bit manually, the hand animation plays\n'
p1210
aS'[15:38] <snover> curious, is there any historical documentation anywhere of attempts to get original sci code out of sierra/activision?\n'
p1211
aS'[15:38] <m_kiewitz> not really, but i talked with Ken Williams about it (effectively he said it without me asking for it)\n'

aS'[15:39] <m_kiewitz> lskovlun: do you have to set it all the time?\n'
p1214
aS'[15:40] <m_kiewitz> or just once per mouse press?\n'
p1215
aS'[15:40] <lskovlun> I tried setting it just once, because event.cpp was giving me trouble.\n'

aS"[15:41] <m_kiewitz> hmm weird, i looked in disassembly - couldn't find bit 9 references\n"
p1218
aS'[15:41] <lskovlun> that will probably be rectified if it is set for a longer period of time\n'

aS'[15:41] <snover> just need to find that one employee that left the office with a couple floppies in hand :)\n'
p1221
aS"[15:42] <m_kiewitz> well, i guess if that employee was honest about it, he/she could get sued to hell and back. and for us getting source now wouldn't be helpful anyway (except for sci32 graphics)\n"
p1222
aS'[15:43] <m_kiewitz> there are so few issues left and our compatibility is quite amazing. there were like 500 sci versions in total or so\n'
p1223
aS'[15:43] <snover> well there is always shivers2 ;)\n'
p1224
aS'[15:44] <snover> of course it is true, i was interested only mostly in the historical perspective, not necessarily to actually go crazy trying to do anything now\n'
p1225
aS'[15:44] <snover> it is just inspiring to see new engines come to scummvm with assistance from the original publishers\n'
p1226
aS"[15:44] <m_kiewitz> all sorts of companies didn't care about archiving source code even 10 years ago\n"

aS'[15:45] <m_kiewitz> for example the classic Silent Hill 2+3 games made by Team Silent\n'
p1228
aS'[15:45] <m_kiewitz> that\'s why the Silent Hill "HD" collection was that awful\n'
p1229
aS'[15:45] <m_kiewitz> b/c they based it on source code that they found. And some months during development they figured that they had some alpha version\n'

aS'[15:47] <m_kiewitz> lskovlun: bit 9 may be mouse down?!?!?!\n'
p1231
aS"[15:48] <m_kiewitz> strangely i can't find those bits getting set in the kq5 disassembly\n"
p1232
aS'[15:48] <m_kiewitz> or maybe im missing something\n'
p1233
aS"[15:49] <m_kiewitz> wait, it's checking mouserelease + bit 9 for mouse button up\n"
p1234
aS'[15:49] <m_kiewitz> and mousebutton + bit 9 for mouse button down\n'
p1235
aS'[15:51] <lskovlun> in the drivers, maybe?\n'
p1236
aS'[15:52] <lskovlun> Setting the bit does help\n'
p1237
aS"[16:02] <m_kiewitz> well i could set a breakpoint in dosbox and check what it's setting normally when no key is pressed\n"
p1238
aS'[16:04] <m_kiewitz> cant find anything about that in the keyboard driver\n'
p1239
aS'[16:16] <lskovlun> Well, the checks look like this:\n'
p1240
aS'[16:16] <lskovlun>     (if ((== (send pEvent:type) evMOUSEBUTTON) and (== (send pEvent:modifiers) 512))   // left-click, mouse down\n'

aS'[16:16] <lskovlun>     (if ((== (send pEvent:type) evMOUSERELEASE) and (== (send pEvent:modifiers) 512))   // left-click, mouse up\n'
p1242
aS"[16:16] <lskovlun> it's kind of odd that the bit would be set upon release, but there you go\n"
p1243
aS'[16:18] <m_kiewitz> weird, i just debugged in dos-box. bit 9 is set right at the start\n'
p1244
aS'[16:18] <m_kiewitz> maybe it signals "nothing else pressed"?\n'
p1245
aS'[16:20] <m_kiewitz> will probably have to check an interpreter from a sierra game. maybe this feature was even hacked in\n'

p1393
aS'[20:22] <snover> heh. well. admittedly, i know about as much as a newborn lamb, but having used cmake in the past and finding it mostly agreeable is why i ask about the separate project generator\n'
p1394

p1401
aS'[20:26] <LordHoto> The alignment define is odd too.\n'
p1402
aS'[20:26] <LordHoto> But this might all come from the fact that it tries to support both iPhone and OS X.\n'

p1407
aS'[20:30] <snover> these defines in xcode generator definitely seems weird\n'
p1408
aS'[20:30] <snover> there is a #if defined(IPHONE) in scummsys.h that sets them\n'

aS'[20:34] <snover> hahaha. well thats something, I guess! :)\n'
p1413
aS'[20:36] <snover> as long as i am in here, i wonder if it makes sense to either set -std=c++98 or to add -Wc++98-compat ?\n'
p1414
aS'[20:36] <LordHoto> At any rate, this is really more of a create_project issue and somebody (tm) should fix that.\n'

p1416

aS'[22:27] <criezy> Maybe with git subtree. But we would first need to make sure the tools compile and work with the ScummVM common code, and fix the issues.\n'
p1832

aS'[13:26] <[md5]> the cyclers are disjoint, yes\n'
p3100
aS"[13:26] <[md5]> um, I'm not quite sure a single copy works? Cycling the array would need a copy, right?\n"
p3101
aS'[13:27] <LordHoto> [md5]: At the start of these apply functions you create a single copy, and then you use that as source for all cyclers.\n'
p3102
aS'[13:28] <[md5]> ah, right\n'
p3103
aS'[13:28] <LordHoto> [md5]: Since cyclers are disjoint (i.e. no colors ever overlap), reading from the initial copy makes no difference.\n'
p3104

p3105
aS'[13:28] <[md5]> thanks\n'
p3106
aS'[13:28] <LordHoto> (no difference to reading from a new copy for every cycler)\n'
p3107
aS'[13:29] <wjp> although it would probably be good not to make a copy if there are no cyclers\n'
p3108
aS'[13:29] <wjp> which is tricky to detect beforehand, but doing it dynamically should be fine\n'
p3109

aS'[13:59] GitHub10 (GitHub10@192.30.252.42) left #scummvm.\n'
p3171
aS'[13:59] <wjp> is that something that should also read from _sysPalette and write to a to-be-added _nextPalette?\n'
p3172
aS"[13:59] <wjp> (because right now it looks to me like the first step would advance it by 1 step, and then the next iteration would advance it by 2 steps on top of that for a total of 3 steps, unless I'm missing something)\n"
p3173
aS'[14:00] <[md5]> I am positive that this code should be called by kSetShowStyle()\n'
p3174
aS'[14:00] <[md5]> (the fading code)\n'
p3175
aS'[14:00] <snover> I think most things read from nextPalette too but let me go check ida\n'
p3176
aS'[14:01] <wjp> that would also be fine as long as _sysPalette is copied to _nextPalette at the start of frameout\n'
p3177
aS'[14:01] <snover> also sorry about the VLA, if anyone has warning flags for the compiler that should be used please let me know\n'
p3178
aS'[14:02] <snover> i mean it was compiling for me when i submitted the final PR and said everything was good to go so i guess i need to go look at where/why else it was failing\n'
p3179
aS'[14:02] <wjp> oh, just compiler differences\n'
p3180
aS'[14:02] <wjp> VS tends to accept more\n'
p3181
aS"[14:02] <[md5]> I don't know why this worked for you: Foo bar[foobar];\n"
p3182
aS"[14:02] <[md5]> it should't...\n"
p3183
aS'[14:03] <m_kiewitz> kSetShowStyle() is afaik the way of telling which transition is supposed to get done\n'
p3184
aS'[14:03] <[md5]> indeed\n'
p3185
aS"[14:03] <wjp> [md5]: you're contradicting yourself now\n"
p3186
aS'[14:03] <[md5]> I am?\n'
p3187
aS"[14:04] <wjp> oh, although in the case of VLA I suppose it's VS that accepts less\n"
p3188
aS'[14:04] <[md5]> kSetShowStyle is called in GK1 on every scene change for fade out/fade in. It checks for a fade table, too\n'
p3189
aS'[14:04] <[md5]> probably\n'
p3190
aS"[14:04] <[md5]> (probably for wjp's comment)\n"
p3191
aS'[14:05] <snover> doesnt c++98 have some auto_ptr or something, like c++11 unique_ptr?\n'
p3192
aS'[14:06] <snover> (just reviewing the commit and seeing a delete for the tempPalette instead of use of a smart pointer)\n'
p3193
aS'[14:06] <snover> it seems like i should at least turn on -Wshadow if other people are using that\n'
p3194
aS'[14:06] <snover> to avoid scaring anybody\n'
p3195
aS'[14:06] <wjp> in gcc, -Wvla warns about VLAs, by the way\n'
p3196
aS'[14:08] <[md5]> VLAs are C99, right?\n'
p3197
aS'[14:08] <wjp> yeah\n'
p3198
aS'[14:08] <wjp> but gcc accepts them in C++\n'
p3199
aS'[14:08] <[md5]> oh\n'
p3200
aS'[14:08] <[md5]> ok\n'
p3201
aS"[14:10] <wjp> snover: we don't allow any STL features like auto_ptr, but we do have a Common::ScopedPtr for example\n"
p3202
aS"[14:11] <wjp> (of course that doesn't handle arrays, but...)\n"
p3203
aS'[14:12] <snover> updating applyAllCycles to avoid a copy on each cycle was a good call. In the original SCI code it was copied on every iteration of the loop so thats why it was that way.\n'
p3204
aS'[14:12] <snover> (and applyCycles)\n'
p3205
aS'[14:12] <wjp> your version only copied the used bits, so that was perfectly fine\n'
p3206
aS'[14:15] <snover> ok, got through all the feedback. sorry about the style stuff too.\n'
p3207
aS'[14:15] <snover> do only member properties get underscore-prefixed then, or is it an indicator of something else entirely?\n'
p3208
aS"[14:15] <wjp> it's for member variables, yes\n"
p3209
aS"[14:16] <wjp> don't worry about the style issues; always takes some time to get used to it. Thanks for the palette REing and code :-)\n"
p3210
aS'[14:17] <snover> so, to confirm from earlier, reads and writes are both done to a nextPal\n'
p3211
aS'[14:17] <wjp> when is nextPal initialized?\n'
p3212
aS'[14:17] <snover> I believe that is done in FrameOut but I am looking now\n'
p3213
aS'[14:17] <wjp> that would make sense\n'
p3214
aS'[14:18] <[md5]> indeed, thanks for the palette REing and code :)\n'
p3215
aS'[14:18] <wjp> [md5]: applyFade is still broken... :-)\n'
p3216
aS'[14:18] <wjp> (_fadeTable[i] / 100) is basically just always 0 or 1\n'
p3217
aS"[14:18] <[md5]> it is? Three time's a charm I guess :P\n"
p3218
aS'[14:18] <[md5]> ah, yes\n'
p3219
aS'[14:18] <[md5]> -_-\n'
p3220
aS'[14:19] <snover> so, there is a function called PaletteMgrIndex::UpdateFFrame\n'
p3221
aS"[14:19] <[md5]> snover: have you checked wjp's work?\n"
p3222
aS'[14:19] <wjp> my work?\n'
p3223
aS"[14:19] <[md5]> on SQ6's IDB\n"
p3224
aS'[14:19] <snover> which, if i trust my previous disassembly notes, copies from sourcePal to nextPal\n'
p3225
aS"[14:20] <wjp> we've exchanged notes, yes\n"
p3226
aS'[14:20] <[md5]> ah, ok\n'
p3227
aS'[14:20] <[md5]> great :)\n'
p3228
aS'[14:20] <snover> there is also a flag that is set on palettemgr\n'
p3229
aS'[14:20] <snover> I called it versionUpdatedThisFrame\n'
p3230
aS'[14:20] <[md5]> hm\n'
p3231
aS'[14:21] <[md5]> that is similar to SCI1 semantics...\n'
p3232
aS'[14:21] <[md5]> IIRC\n'
p3233
aS'[14:21] <[md5]> one sec\n'
p3234
aS'[14:22] <[md5]> that sounds similar to picNotValid?\n'
p3235
aS'[14:22] <[md5]> oh wait, no\n'
p3236
aS'[14:22] <snover> so there is a version number set on each palette, which IIRC is also used in save/restore, and when the version is incremented then this flag also gets set\n'
p3237
aS'[14:22] <[md5]> we use a timestamp for that\n'
p3238
aS'[14:23] <snover> just to make sure i am clear, the version number is specific to the palette\n'
p3239
aS'[14:23] <snover> it is not some shared global timestamp or anything\n'
p3240
aS'[14:24] <snover> so when you restore a game your palette is set back up exactly the way it was before\n'
p3241
aS'[14:24] <[md5]> there\'s the "timestamp" component in the Palette struct\n'
p3242
aS'[14:24] <snover> oh ok\n'
p3243
aS'[14:24] <[md5]> which is used for this purpose\n'
p3244
aS"[14:24] <[md5]> perhaps it's this variable?\n"
p3245
aS'[14:26] <snover> i will take a peek and see\n'
p3246
aS'[14:26] <snover> any monotonically increasing number is probably ok, it isnt used to determine cycling interval or anything\n'
p3247
aS'[14:27] <snover> there are parts that are sensitive to tick count though\n'
p3248
aS'[14:27] <snover> and actually tick count is supposed to be saved and restored from the save file\n'
p3249
aS'[14:28] <snover> oh, I put a note on SciEngine::getTickCount but didnt mark it as TODO. that should be a TODO.\n'
p3250
aS'[14:29] <snover> be careful not to take too long to finish your SCI engine games or your game timer will overflow and everything will crash ;)\n'
p3251
aS'[14:29] <wjp> heh\n'
p3252
aS'[14:30] <wjp> if we really want, I suppose we can "compress" all values back to a small range when an overflow happens\n'
p3253
aS'[14:30] <wjp> for the palette version anyway\n'
p3254
aS'[14:30] <wjp> for the game timer that may be trickier\n'
p3255
aS'[14:36] <snover> I believe the limit is a little over 397 days of game runtime\n'
p3256
aS'[14:36] <snover> so you would have to be really bad at pixel hunting to get stuck that long\n'
p3257
aS'[14:36] <snover> if we always treat it as unsigned then you can take up to two years to be stuck\n'
p3258
aS'[14:39] <LordHoto> [md5]: I saw a lot of "(uint8) foo" instead of "(uint8)foo".\n'
p3259
aS'[14:41] <snover> [md5]: yes, it looks like this is indeed the timestamp property\n'
p3260
aS'[14:42] <snover> since it is not actually a time value i would not normally have thought to use the word timestamp :)\n'
p3261
aS'[14:48] <[md5]> LordHoto: oh, true\n'
p3262
aS'[14:48] <[md5]> snover: heh :)\n'
p3263
aS'[14:49] <[md5]> a timestamp ensures far less collisions than a small integer\n'
p3264
aS"[14:51] <wjp> ...no it doesn't\n"
p3265
aS"[14:53] <[md5]> it doesn't?\n"
p3266
aS'[14:55] <snover> the collision space is 32-bits in both cases and the value is always monotonically increasing so the only thing a timestamp value does is give you lots of holes that can never be filled :)\n'

p3268
aS"[14:57] #scummvm: mode change '+o Littleboy' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.\n"
p3269
aS'[14:58] <snover> though in this case it is really an elementary point, since the timestamp being used right now is the same as SciEngine::getTickCount so youre still bound to the maximum getTickCount\n'
p3270
aS'[14:58] <snover> like there is no reason to version palette with a separate number since if you go over getTickCount things are going to crash anyway\n'
p3271

p3278
aS'[15:19] <m_kiewitz> 518400 per day? so it would take over a year to overfow\n'
p3279
aS"[15:20] <m_kiewitz> (and that's for a signed tick count)\n"
p3280
aS'[15:21] <snover> yeah, so be careful not to write a game that has 19000 hours of play time ok :)\n'
p3281
aS'[15:24] <[md5]> question is: can you leave a Sierra game running for a year?\n'
p3282
aS'[15:24] <snover> id have to look if the tick count was signed or not\n'
p3283
aS'[15:25] <snover> it is saved and restored in save files so it is not just can you leave it running but can you accumulate more than a year of game time\n'
p3284
aS'[15:26] <[md5]> we got a similar functionality in saved games of a lot of engines\n'
p3285

p3300

p3301
aS'[16:22] <snover> yeah it is saved and restored by TimeMgr\n'

p3572
aS'[15:36] <snover> LordHoto: the i++ increment on the outer loop never happens, it should probably just be an `if`\n'

p3581
aS'[15:39] <snover> m_kiewitz: some palettes were broken before i started, actually the reason why i started with palette cycling is because roger at the beginning of SQ6 is messed up\n'
p3582
aS'[15:39] <snover> and i thought maybe it was because there was cycling with the transport that would fix it\n'
p3583
aS'[15:39] <LordHoto> 9 is probably the status code which indiciates that the operation failed\n'
p3584
aS'[15:40] <snover> m_kiewitz: somebody, i cant remember who, fixed that problem by disabling some other part of the palette code, but i cant remember which part, i would have to search the logs\n'
p3585
aS'[15:40] <m_kiewitz> snover: i updated to latest commit today and before doing so palettes in sci32 worked "somewhat" fine. I mean they didn\'t work 100% properly of course b/c the code is guess-work\n'
p3586
aS'[15:41] <m_kiewitz> snover: and since my update all screens are at least a bit broken palette-wise\n'
p3587
aS'[15:41] <snover> m_kiewitz: hm. let me run and check, one moment\n'
p3588
aS'[15:41] <m_kiewitz> sq6 sierra intro for example is already broken (the spinning sierra globe)\n'
p3589
aS'[15:41] <m_kiewitz> sq6 main menu as well etc. etc.\n'
p3590
aS'[15:42] <snover> whoa really? that was definitely not the case when i submitted the pr\n'
p3591
aS'[15:42] <snover> im running sq6 now\n'
p3592
aS'[15:42] <m_kiewitz> at least it sees sci16 still works fine, at least the few games that i tried\n'
p3593
aS'[15:42] <snover> not to throw others under the bus but i think this is [md5] fault :)\n'
p3594
aS"[15:42] <LordHoto> Maybe one of [md5]'s cleanup commits broke things?\n"

p3613
aS"[15:49] <Vanfanel> And that's on a lowly Raspbery Pi 1, with the same SOC as the Rpi ZERO. So a 5$ computer can do the same with that code...\n"
p3614
aS"[15:49] <Vanfanel> if this isn't awesome, I don't know what it is :D\n"
p3615
aS'[15:49] <m_kiewitz> snover: was that a new line? it should be removed?\n'
p3616

p3617
aS'[15:50] <snover> m_kiewitz: i am looking at how it got changed\n'
p3618
aS'[15:52] <snover> m_kiewitz: so it looks like, that code was there before but i wrote it wrong (forgot to increment the pointer in the loop)\n'
p3619
aS'[15:53] <snover> so it was always using the first value in the fade table\n'
p3620
aS'[15:53] <m_kiewitz> so wait, what will need to get changed to fix it?\n'
p3621
aS'[15:53] <snover> im going to look at the disassembly again now to figure out what is going on. it could be that this is an artefact of the fact that SCI engine applies this to an intermediate nextPalette\n'
p3622
aS'[15:54] <snover> but ScummVM is currently applying directly to the display palette\n'
p3623
aS'[15:54] <snover> m_kiewitz: the way to fix the regression is to just always set the fade values even if the fade amount is 100%\n'
p3624
aS'[15:55] <snover> i.e. remove lines 317 and 318\n'
p3625
aS'[15:56] <snover> i definitely transcribed the function correctly from the assembly though https://zetafleet.com/i/56912d7c3003e.png\n'
p3626
aS'[15:57] <snover> ecx is used as a counter 0255*4\n'
p3627
aS'[15:58] <snover> and ebx points to a palette entry in nextPal\n'
p3628
aS"[15:59] <LordHoto> 0-255*4? If there's only one fade entry per color, it seems like it should be 255 max?\n"
p3629
aS"[15:59] <fuzzie> it's in bytes, though\n"
p3630
aS'[16:00] <snover> the entries in the fade table are 32-bit aligned with a value range of 0 to 100\n'
p3631
aS'[16:01] borosky (~broosky@088156132138.dynamic-ww-4.vectranet.pl) left irc: Ping timeout: 246 seconds\n'
p3632
aS'[16:01] <LordHoto> Right, this is 32 bit integers and the counter is probably increased by 4 :-P\n'
p3633
aS'[16:02] <snover> yes, exactly\n'
p3634
aS"[16:02] <LordHoto> snover: You didn't implement clamping!!!!!!11111111111\n"
p3635
aS'[16:02] <snover> its my first day\n'
p3636
aS'[16:03] <snover> so there was a bug in my code, i forgot to increment the fadeTable pointer during the loop, [md5] fixed that, but it seems there is other unimplemented stuff in SCI engine that means skipping setting palette entries that are not faded at all is causing them to remain at their previous fade value\n'
p3637
aS'[16:04] <snover> thats what that TODO is about, this part of the implementation I had not completed. if I had noticed the pointer arithmetic bug then i would have also seen that palettes stopped showing up and i would have disabled more of this code before the PR :)\n'
p3638
aS'[16:05] <fuzzie> yes, why did you not implement all of SCI yet\n'
p3639
aS'[16:05] <fuzzie> this is basically the issue here\n'
p3640
aS'[16:05] <snover> i blame myself, fuzzie\n'
p3641
aS"[16:05] <LordHoto> yeah, I don't get that either\n"
p3642
aS'[16:05] <fuzzie> snover: as do we!\n'
p3643
aS'[16:05] <LordHoto> A classic case of trying to take the easy route and letting others worry about it!\n'
p3644
aS'[16:06] <snover> so do you want me to submit a PR with this fix or would you just like to do it? i mean i am already taking the easy way out here so i might as well just have someone else deal with it right :)\n'
p3645
aS"[16:07] <LordHoto> I'll gladly comment it out and add a comment, if you fix the hyped project with two l at the beginning.\n"
p3646
aS'[16:07] <snover> llamavm\n'
p3647
aS'[16:10] <snover> how do i fix that? seems like a bad deal for me\n'
p3648
aS'[16:10] <LordHoto> Obviously by implementing more palette logic.\n'
p3649
aS'[16:10] <snover> oh ok\n'
p3650
aS'[16:10] <snover> i can do that\n'
p3651

p3652
aS'[16:15] <snover> man\n'
p3653
aS'[16:15] <snover> i actually dont know why removing those two lines would unbreak it\n'

aS'[18:14] <snover> wjp: sci sq6 retrieves palette resources from resource manager and converts them a specific type HunkPalette in kPalette, and then the version/timestamp field on these HunkPalette objects is set when they are submitted to be used as the source palette for palettemgr. do you have any sense of why this would be necessary? scummvm skips the HunkPalette and just initialises raw data into a single Palette type\n'
p3706
aS'[18:14] <wjp> Hm, I did notice these two types\n'
p3707
aS'[18:15] <wjp> Unsure of the point\n'
p3708

aS"[18:16] <wjp> (Not at home so can't really look)\n"
p3710
aS'[18:17] <snover> seems HunkPalette is a thin wrapper around the raw data from disk\n'
p3711
aS'[18:17] <snover> it gets converted to SOLPalette in PaletteMgr::Submit\n'
p3712
aS'[18:18] <snover> there are two versions of PaletteMgr::Submit, one takes a HunkPalette and the other takes a SOLPalette\n'
p3713
aS'[18:19] <snover> only the HunkPalette has the version field\n'
p3714
aS'[18:19] <snover> which from what i can see, based on a discussion from earlier this week, is used to do pic invalidation\n'
p3715
aS'[18:20] <snover> oh, and actually, its used to avoid recopying a source palette that is already loaded to sourcePal too\n'
p3716
aS'[18:23] <snover> however, when kPalette is called, it unconditionally constructs a new HunkPalette with version set to 0, so i guess there must be somewhere else that HunkPalettes come from\n'
p3717
aS'[18:25] <snover> however however, actually the initialiser for the HunkPalette checks some pointery looking thing and then will copy the version back out from there\n'

aS"[18:58] <m_kiewitz> snover: yeah, there is nothing at all that gets called constantly. That why we had to do all sorts of weird stuff for our speed throttler and even the current one doesn't work perfectly\n"
p4012
aS"[18:59] <m_kiewitz> for example when you fight in qfg3, some inner loop is called and the functions, that are normally called in the regular game loop aren't called anymore\n"
p4013
aS'[18:59] <m_kiewitz> that causes fighting to work way faster than it should\n'
p4014
aS'[18:59] <wjp> SCI32 might be nicer with Frameout\n'
p4015
aS'[18:59] <m_kiewitz> it probably is\n'
p4016
aS"[19:01] <m_kiewitz> i wanted to rewrite the speed throttler, so that it actually counts how many sci intructions were executed and so on, that could probably work better than the current approach, but I'm not sure if it will be the solution, that will work for everything properly\n"
p4017
aS'[19:02] <snover> cool, cool. before i finish this and send it ill look to see if there is someplace sane in frameout to call screen updates\n'
p4018
aS'[19:03] <snover> i may also need some help getting the save file data packed up correctly\n'
p4019
aS'[19:03] <snover> but i havent looked yet, just wrote a todo\n'
p4020
aS'[19:04] <m_kiewitz> well i guess frameout will probably copy something to the actual screen? and then right after that updatescreen() could get called\n'
p4021
aS'[19:04] <m_kiewitz> i expect frameout to be basically a "sane" kAnimate\n'
p4022
aS'[19:05] <snover> i also noticed that the newer kPalVaryInit signature had a signature of SCI21 and later only& do you guys know offhand if this was a mistake or if indeed things were not changed with kPalVary until 2.1?\n'
p4023
aS'[19:05] <snover> (i have not looked at the commit history to check)\n'
p4024
aS'[19:05] <snover> (to check to see if there is an explanation*)\n'
p4025
aS'[19:08] <m_kiewitz> it seems another parameter was added since 2.1 early\n'
p4026
aS'[19:09] <snover> so in sci2 it was still using the old palvary code and in sci2.1 was when they actually changed it?\n'
p4027
aS'[19:09] <m_kiewitz> it seems yes\n'
p4028
aS'[19:09] <snover> hm.\n'
p4029
aS'[19:10] <m_kiewitz> well maybe the code was adjusted in some way, but the parameters seem to have been the same\n'

p4033
aS'[19:11] <m_kiewitz> well it even seems that sci2.1 used basically the same, they just added another parameter to kPalVaryInit\n'

aS'[19:15] <m_kiewitz> if you really need to split it up, i would prefer it if everything got split up and not some sub-functions only\n'
p4048
aS'[19:16] <snover> actually i know they did\n'
p4049
aS'[19:16] <m_kiewitz> for example PalVaryOff and were surely basically the same PalVaryDeinit\n'

aS'[19:17] <snover> kgraphics.cpp kPalVaryInit parameters are paletteId, ticks, stepStop, direction. in SQ6 the parameters are paletteId, an unknown number, fromColor, and toColor\n'

aS'[19:18] <m_kiewitz> is there a scene in sq6 that is currently reachable, that uses PalVary?\n'

p4062
aS'[19:18] <m_kiewitz> first scene? intro? sierra logo? first playable room?\n'

aS'[19:19] <snover> sorry, first playable room.\n'

aS'[19:22] <snover> it seems that way. i think that is why he looked all messed up before.\n'
p4076
aS'[19:22] <snover> unfortunately for some reason this morning i cant seem to get into the game because of the transporter hang\n'
p4077
aS'[19:23] <snover> there we go. finally.\n'
p4078
aS'[19:23] <m_kiewitz> hmm i wonder if they only changed that or more\n'
p4079
aS'[19:23] <m_kiewitz> you could do a "logkernel PalVary on" in debugger to see the calls\n'
p4080
aS'[19:24] <snover> yeah so once roger appears in the ground, kPalVary happens\n'
p4081
aS'[19:24] <snover> it gets called over and over and over again\n'
p4082
aS'[19:24] <m_kiewitz> can you check the parameters? use logkernel PalVary on\n'
p4083
aS'[19:24] <snover> (0000:0159, 0000:0000, 0000:0069, 0000:0040, 0000:004f)\n'
p4084
aS"[19:24] <m_kiewitz> that's kPalVaryInit I guess\n"
p4085
aS'[19:24] <snover> yes\n'
p4086
aS'[19:24] <snover> i have only seen kPalVaryInit and kPalVaryOff so far\n'
p4087
aS"[19:25] <m_kiewitz> maybe it's actually the flame effect and not wilco?!\n"
p4088
aS"[19:25] <m_kiewitz> that would explain why it's called all the time. or maybe we don't return the correct value atm\n"
p4089
aS'[19:25] <m_kiewitz> but the names that you used sound basically like current PalVary code\n'
p4090
aS'[19:26] <snover> as far as i can tell the return value is null\n'
p4091
aS"[19:26] <m_kiewitz> so it wouldn't surprise me, if just a bit was changed\n"
p4092
aS'[19:26] <snover> some of the other ones have return values\n'
p4093
aS'[19:27] <snover> at least i am assuming that the ones that `mov unk_c7844, ax` right before the retn are the ones that return values\n'
p4094
aS'[19:28] <snover> m_kiewitz: well, some things seem to have been changed meaningfully incompatibly :)\n'
p4095
aS'[19:29] <m_kiewitz> yes question is how much was changed.\n'
p4096
aS"[19:29] <m_kiewitz> well i guess sci32 didn't change palette via timer anymore. so maybe sci2 and also the changes for sci2.1 should go into palette32.cpp\n"
p4097
aS'[19:29] <snover> it doesnt run on a separate thread, vary steps are 0100 not 064\n'
p4098
aS"[19:31] <m_kiewitz> i definitely wouldn't mix calls up. either completely separate (but with either one separate additional set for sci2 and another set for sci2.1, or with if (getVersion) inside it\n"
p4099
aS'[19:31] <snover> its definitely similar in ways, which is why this has been challenging for me to know exactly what to do\n'
p4100
aS'[19:31] <snover> ok\n'
p4101
aS'[19:31] <snover> thats helpful advice\n'
p4102
aS"[19:31] <wjp> (by the way, that unk_c7844 is very likely to be the VM's accumulator)\n"
p4103
aS'[19:31] <m_kiewitz> well you can use our current implemtentation as reference. i reversed it and it should be 100% accurate to the sci1.1 one\n'
p4104
aS'[19:32] <m_kiewitz> i guess you got the names from the debug symbols? because in that case it sounds basically the same\n'
p4105
aS'[19:32] <snover> haha. yeah! i was actually in the middle of typing a question asking if you had used any debug symbols when naming things\n'
p4106
aS"[19:32] <m_kiewitz> no, i haven't because i had none.\n"
p4107
aS'[19:32] <snover> ok\n'
p4108
aS'[19:32] <snover> thats also useful to know\n'
p4109
aS'[19:32] <wjp> (so that mov unk_c7844 is most likely similar to how we often return s->r_acc)\n'
p4110
aS'[19:32] <m_kiewitz> i named them according to what they are doing\n'
p4111
aS'[19:33] <snover> wjp: yeah, that is what i had assumed :)\n'
p4112
aS'[19:33] <m_kiewitz> wjp: can you somewhat "easily" check gk1 if it uses the old sci1.1 timer approach?\n'
p4113
aS'[19:33] <snover> m_kiewitz: well you did a good job, the names are clearer in some cases than the actual sci engine names :)\n'
p4114
aS'[19:33] <m_kiewitz> i really wonder if they changed that bit already for sci2 or if they kept timer from sci1.1 and changed it for sci2.1\n'
p4115
aS"[19:34] <wjp> m_kiewitz: I don't know the timer difference offhand. What would I look for?\n"
p4116
aS'[19:34] <m_kiewitz> let me check my disassembly.\n'
p4117
aS'[19:35] <snover> m_kiewitz: by the way, about ida free, there is a really old ida free version that can read the LE format executables once you extract them from the DOS extender, and then the latest ida free will read and upgrade the database from that old version. that is how i am using ida free with sq6 :P\n'
p4118
aS'[19:35] <m_kiewitz> snover: you got that one? and you also got gk1?\n'
p4119
aS'[19:36] <snover> sorry, which one is that one? :)\n'
p4120
aS'[19:37] <m_kiewitz> snover: that ida free version of course\n'
p4121
aS'[19:37] <snover> oh\n'
p4122
aS'[19:37] <snover> yes\n'
p4123
aS'[19:37] <fuzzie> be sure to re-analyze the whole binary in latest ida free after :)\n'
p4124
aS'[19:38] <m_kiewitz> wjp: at the end of kPalVaryInit, so kPalVary(0) sierra called some sort of "install server" function, that made the PalVary code get called on every tick\n'
p4125
aS'[19:38] <m_kiewitz> seg061:2658                 mov     ax, offset _PaletteServer\n'

p4135
aS'[19:39] <snover> i will see what i can do! i have gk1cd\n'
p4136

p4144
aS'[19:41] <m_kiewitz> dated 11.1.1994\n'
p4145
aS'[19:42] <snover> they changed something then\n'

p4153
aS'[19:43] <m_kiewitz> so even older than the LE release\n'
p4154
aS'[19:43] <m_kiewitz> well "newer", depending on how you look at it\n'
p4155
aS"[19:43] <m_kiewitz> wjp: that's really weird, because sunrise works properly in scummvm already\n"
p4156
aS'[19:44] <wjp> why is that weird?\n'
p4157
aS'[19:44] <m_kiewitz> well it seems sierra changed parameters for kPalVary in sq6\n'
p4158
aS"[19:44] <m_kiewitz> so if gk1 + sq6 kPalVary are basically the same, then sunrise shouldn't work atm\n"
p4159
aS"[19:44] <m_kiewitz> anyway you didn't find a hint of some timer routine?\n"
p4160
aS"[19:44] <m_kiewitz> i guess you didn't\n"

p4164
aS'[19:45] <wjp> so not identical\n'
p4165
aS'[19:45] <m_kiewitz> wjp: does gk1 also have the additional kPalVary subfunctions?\n'
p4166
aS'[19:46] <m_kiewitz> possibly 8 + 9? in our code 7 is not available, but probably should be\n'
p4167
aS'[19:46] <m_kiewitz> sci1.1 subfunctions went from 0 to 6\n'
p4168
aS'[19:46] <wjp> it seems gk1 has three different codepaths in PalVaryInit, but sq6 has four\n'
p4169
aS'[19:47] <wjp> (based on number of arguments)\n'
p4170
aS'[19:47] <snover> augh :D\n'
p4171
aS'[19:47] <lskovlun> but they end up in the same function, right?\n'
p4172
aS'[19:47] <snover> wjp: what are the default parameters sent to palettemgr for the lowest argc?\n'
p4173
aS'[19:47] <lskovlun> SCI3 does\n'
p4174
aS'[19:47] <snover> wjp: actually, can you just give me the address :)\n'
p4175
aS"[19:47] <wjp> the jumptable in gk1's PalVary has 10 entries\n"
p4176
aS'[19:48] <wjp> snover: kernel functions are easy to find: just look for their name in a string\n'
p4177
aS'[19:48] <m_kiewitz> so up to 9 too, oh well\n'
p4178
aS"[19:48] <wjp> snover: you'll find the kernel function table which consists of (function pointer, name) pairs\n"
p4179
aS'[19:48] <snover> cool\n'
p4180
aS"[19:49] <wjp> (so you'll want the function pointer _before_ the name string)\n"
p4181
aS'[19:49] <m_kiewitz> i really think that implementing it inside palette32.cpp would probably be the best solution and then maybe just using getVersion() calls for the differences\n'
p4182
aS'[19:49] <m_kiewitz> wjp: can you somewhat easily figure out how much of the subfunctions changed?\n'
p4183
aS"[19:49] <m_kiewitz> maybe they didn't change some subfunctions at all and only changed a few parameters only\n"
p4184
aS'[19:50] <snover> wjp: great, i found it, thanks\n'
p4185
aS'[19:50] <lskovlun> In SCI3, they end up in the same function, passing default values\n'
p4186
aS'[19:50] <m_kiewitz> can we check sci2.1 early easily? i wonder if sierra really added those changed for sci2.1 as a whole or added them for sci2.1 middle\n'
p4187
aS'[19:51] <wjp> m_kiewitz: comparing cases.... < 3 args is the same\n'
p4188
aS'[19:51] <wjp> m_kiewitz: < 4 is also the same\n'
p4189
aS'[19:52] <wjp> m_kiewitz: < 5 too\n'
p4190
aS'[19:52] <wjp> m_kiewitz: so SQ6 just has an added case for >= 5 args\n'
p4191
aS'[19:52] <wjp> the rest are the same, from looking line-by-line\n'
p4192
aS'[19:52] <m_kiewitz> and the other kPalVary subfunctions too?\n'
p4193
aS'[19:52] <wjp> well\n'
p4194
aS"[19:53] <wjp> that's another thousand lines to compare :-)\n"
p4195
aS'[19:54] <wjp> 1 is the same\n'
p4196
aS'[19:54] <wjp> 5 has subtle differences\n'
p4197

aS"[19:55] <wjp> (don't ask me why they're in this order, but that's the same in both :-) )\n"
p4199
aS'[19:55] <m_kiewitz> 5 is change ticks?!\n'
p4200
aS'[19:55] <m_kiewitz> you numbered them with base 0, right?\n'
p4201
aS'[19:56] <wjp> 4 is the same\n'
p4202
aS'[19:56] <wjp> yes, base 0\n'
p4203
aS'[19:56] <m_kiewitz> what did they even do in sci32 for that opcode? in sci2.1 they changed 2 variables and reinstalled the timer function\n'
p4204
aS'[19:56] <wjp> 6 is the same\n'
p4205
aS'[19:56] <m_kiewitz> s/sci2.1/sci1.1 of course\n'
p4206
aS'[19:57] <m_kiewitz> wait, one variable only\n'

aS'[19:57] <snover> m_kiewitz: you are wondering about op5?\n'
p4208
aS'[19:57] <m_kiewitz> yes\n'
p4209
aS'[19:57] <wjp> 7 is the same\n'
p4210
aS'[19:57] <m_kiewitz> in sci1.1 op 5 was just the op to change the amount of ticks per step\n'
p4211
aS'[19:57] <snover> op5 calls to PaletteMgr::SetVaryTime\n'
p4212
aS'[19:58] <m_kiewitz> wjp: you said op 5 got changed what got changed? more code added? whole code changed completely?\n'
p4213
aS'[19:58] <wjp> 8 is the same\n'
p4214
aS'[19:58] <m_kiewitz> maybe they just moved the VaryTime code to somewhere else\n'
p4215
aS'[19:58] <wjp> m_kiewitz: some movs are slightly different; would have to trace to see what happens\n'
p4216
aS'[19:59] <wjp> 9 is the same; 2 is the same\n'
p4217
aS'[19:59] <snover> PaletteMgr::SetVaryTime takes the parameter, divides it by varyPercent, and puts the resulting value into some varyDelay member\n'

p4220
aS'[20:00] <wjp> I think the difference in PalVary(5) is just a minor compiler difference\n'
p4221
aS'[20:00] <m_kiewitz> sets varyDirection according to what? a parameter?\n'
p4222
aS'[20:01] <m_kiewitz> ah i see\n'
p4223
aS'[20:01] <m_kiewitz> so they only changed op 0 then?\n'
p4224
aS'[20:01] <m_kiewitz> really weird\n'
p4225
aS'[20:01] <wjp> and even there only added an extra mode\n'
p4226
aS'[20:01] <snover> based on whether the numerator was positive or negative\n'

aS'[20:27] <snover> so in conclusion it sounds like i can assume for now the SQ6 implementation will support SCI2 up to at least SQI2.1 middle, and also that I should just completely separate it from the SCI1 kPalVary code?\n'
p4243
aS'[20:27] <snover> is that right, wjp and m_kiewitz?\n'
p4244
aS'[20:28] <m_kiewitz> well, i would copy over the current kPalVary code from palette.cpp into palette32.cpp, adjust at least the timer code and then implement the new code for sci2.1 middle for kPalVaryInit\n'
p4245
aS'[20:29] <snover> ok. but you do prefer that i copy it instead of doing things like making the methods on GfxPalette virtual and overriding them?\n'
p4246
aS'[20:29] <m_kiewitz> the current code should be used for kPalVary only up to sci1.1, otherwise we will get a mess\n'
p4247
aS'[20:29] <m_kiewitz> yes, palette.cpp should be renamed later to palette16.cpp and only get used for sci0 up to sci1.1 only\n'

p4411
aS'[00:01] <[md5]> hrm\n'
p4412
aS'[00:01] <[md5]> yeah, m_kiewitz wrote these\n'
p4413
aS'[00:01] <snover> in some cases the changes are good, like not using a separate thread for palvary\n'
p4414
aS'[00:02] <snover> i mean, good from a simplicity perspective\n'
p4415
aS"[00:02] <m_kiewitz> [md5]: it seems SCI2.1 early or middle added another parameter to kPalVaryInit and a different parameter behavior in case it's passed\n"
p4416
aS'[00:02] <m_kiewitz> and what snover just said, no palvary timer function anymore\n'
p4417
aS'[00:02] <m_kiewitz> although it seems the timer stuff was already removed since sci2\n'
p4418
aS'[00:02] <m_kiewitz> and 3 more sub-functions were added for sci2 too\n'
p4419
aS'[00:03] <[md5]> so, they moved the timer stuff to kFrameOut\n'
p4420
aS'[00:03] <m_kiewitz> wjp checked that today\n'
p4421
aS'[00:03] <[md5]> right?\n'
p4422
aS'[00:03] <m_kiewitz> i guess so\n'

p4424
aS'[00:03] <[md5]> that would make sense\n'
p4425
aS'[00:03] <m_kiewitz> at least no timer function anymore\n'
p4426
aS'[00:04] <snover> other things seem to be possibly more different than they first appeared. kPalVaryReverse for example, seems to have been replaced with a kPalVarySetPercent which is just&frankly it looks bodged in\n'
p4427
aS"[00:04] <[md5]> the multiplication by 60 is to get the ticks, if I'm not mistaken\n"
p4428
aS'[00:04] <m_kiewitz> all the functions are the same, when you compare sci2 + sci2.1 except for that new parameter in init\n'
p4429
aS'[00:04] <[md5]> cause they use ticks everywhere\n'
p4430
aS"[00:04] <m_kiewitz> i would be surprised if they stopped using ticks. The sunrise in gk1 works properly already, and that's using kPalVary\n"
p4431
aS'[00:05] <[md5]> no, they still are using ticks\n'

p4433
aS'[00:05] <snover> kPalVarySetPercent calls PaletteMgr::setVaryPercent, ok fine, but then it always sets the last two arguments to -1, and also those last two arguments both set the PaletteMgr::varyFromColor property if they are > -1\n'
p4434
aS'[00:06] <[md5]> odd\n'
p4435
aS'[00:06] <snover> seems like one of them was probably supposed to be varyToColor but they never actually tested/used it? dunno\n'
p4436
aS'[00:06] <[md5]> btw, if you are interested\n'
p4437
aS'[00:06] <snover> maybe fixed in later engines\n'
p4438
aS"[00:06] <[md5]> there's a SCI debugging tool floating around the net\n"
p4439
aS'[00:06] <[md5]> that is used to view SCI resources\n'
p4440
aS'[00:06] <[md5]> including game scripts\n'
p4441
aS'[00:06] <snover> the uh, sci resource viewer?\n'
p4442
aS'[00:06] <[md5]> that one, yes\n'
p4443
aS'[00:06] <[md5]> we have an extensive debug console\n'
p4444
aS'[00:07] <[md5]> which can be used to step in SCI scripts and add runtime breaks\n'
p4445
aS'[00:07] <[md5]> and also to find where specific kernel functions are called\n'
p4446
aS'[00:07] <snover> yes, i need to probably learn the scummvm debugger commands better/at all at some point :)\n'
p4447
aS'[00:07] <[md5]> :)\n'
p4448
aS'[00:07] <[md5]> well, we got a lot from FreeSCI\n'
p4449
aS'[00:08] <[md5]> the engine you see nowadays is the result of a lot of people\n'
p4450
aS'[00:08] <snover> of course, this would be too much work for one person!\n'
p4451
aS'[00:08] <[md5]> m_kiewitz is our local hero on SCI\n'
p4452
aS'[00:08] <[md5]> lskovlun was working on FreeSCI, mainly on the kernel\n'
p4453
aS'[00:08] <snover> im grateful for the help i get while i am working on this\n'
p4454
aS"[00:09] <[md5]> he's probably the only member from FreeSCI who's still actively working on SCI\n"
p4455
aS'[00:09] <[md5]> there was another guy\n'
p4456
aS'[00:09] <snover> awesome :)\n'
p4457
aS'[00:09] <[md5]> Greg Frieger, IIRC\n'
p4458
aS'[00:10] <[md5]> something like that\n'
p4459
aS"[00:10] <m_kiewitz> we also merged another reversed sci engine into it, because freesci did the VM really well, but the graphics weren't working properly especially for sci1+\n"
p4460
aS'[00:10] <m_kiewitz> that happened in 2009 and 2010\n'
p4461
aS'[00:10] <[md5]> he discovered that the executable from KQ5CD was full of debug symbols\n'
p4462
aS'[00:10] <[md5]> and he used that as a base for his own reversing effort on SCI\n'
p4463
aS'[00:10] <[md5]> most of the graphics code was merged from that engine\n'
p4464
aS'[00:10] <[md5]> by m_kiewitz, mostly\n'
p4465
aS'[00:11] <[md5]> so, the current status is:\n'
p4466
aS'[00:11] <ScummBot> Port build status changed with 6d2dca8c: 03Success: master-motoezx\n'
p4467
aS"[00:11] <m_kiewitz> yes, freesci worked sort of fine for most of sci0 and sci01, but sci1 was broken and lsl6 for example was completely broken back then and didn't work right\n"
p4468
aS'[00:11] <[md5]> - the graphics code for SCI0-SCI1 was merged from that other engine, and follows the original\n'
p4469
aS'[00:11] <snover> ill be back in a few minutes, please continue :)\n'
p4470
aS'[00:11] <[md5]> then m_kiewitz did some of the extra parts needed for SCI1.1\n'
p4471
aS'[00:11] <[md5]> like scaling\n'
p4472
aS"[00:11] <m_kiewitz> wasn't really surprising, because freesci used clean room approach, if i remember correctly\n"
p4473
aS'[00:11] <[md5]> and...\n'
p4474
aS'[00:12] <[md5]> hm\n'
p4475
aS'[00:12] <[md5]> we were mostly missing scaling for SCI1.1, IIRC\n'
p4476
aS"[00:12] <m_kiewitz> and in sci it's like have some tiny not work exactly like in the original SCI and it will cause some issues in some random game in some random room\n"
p4477
aS'[00:12] <m_kiewitz> ^tiny thing\n'
p4478
aS"[00:13] <[md5]> the sound code is rewritten based on Greg's work\n"
p4479
aS'[00:13] <[md5]> in fact, almost all of the engine has been rewritten from FreeSCI based on disassembly\n'
p4480
aS"[00:13] <[md5]> the stuff that's not based on disassembly is:\n"
p4481
aS'[00:13] <[md5]> - the SCI kernel\n'
p4482
aS'[00:14] <[md5]> - the SCI0 text parser\n'
p4483
aS'[00:14] <[md5]> - the pathfinding code (was rewritten to A* by waltervn)\n'
p4484
aS"[00:14] <[md5]> I think that's about it\n"
p4485
aS'[00:14] <m_kiewitz> well kPalVary was also introduced in SCI1.1. SCI1.1 also changed some palette behavior (although not exactly SCI1.1, but a few versions into it). Changed resource formats.\n'
p4486
aS'[00:14] <[md5]> ah yes\n'
p4487
aS'[00:14] <[md5]> kPalVary\n'
p4488
aS'[00:15] <[md5]> that too :)\n'
p4489
aS"[00:15] <m_kiewitz> Japanese support was also added by us later, I don't know if FreeSCI ever supported it\n"
p4490
aS'[00:15] <[md5]> and some game-speficic stuf, like the portraits for KQ6CD\n'
p4491
aS"[00:15] <[md5]> I don't think it did\n"
p4492
aS'[00:15] <[md5]> the SCI kernel is a major pain as it kept changing\n'
p4493
aS'[00:15] <m_kiewitz> right, portraits were a nightmare. we had them implemented somewhat for years until the file format was finally fully reversed\n'
p4494
aS'[00:15] <m_kiewitz> i think even 1.7.0 still contains the old inaccurate portrait code\n'
p4495
aS'[00:15] <[md5]> theoretically, we have full support regarding the kernel for SCI0-SCI2.1\n'
p4496
aS'[00:16] <[md5]> in SCI3, the kernel was changed to be 32-bit, among other changes\n'
p4497
aS"[00:16] <m_kiewitz> couldn't wrap my head around the file format back then\n"
p4498
aS'[00:16] <[md5]> yeah\n'
p4499
aS"[00:16] <m_kiewitz> and kq6 windows used hacked in windows 3.11 DLLs for the portraits, so we couldn't easily just reverse the interpreter\n"
p4500
aS'[00:17] <[md5]> oh yes\n'
p4501
aS'[00:17] <[md5]> these were done by a different company\n'
p4502
aS'[00:17] <m_kiewitz> i reversed some of the DLLs, but the implementation was absolutely crazy\n'
p4503
aS'[00:17] <[md5]> and they just injected the portraits dynamically via that DLL\n'
p4504
aS'[00:17] <[md5]> interesting stuff :)\n'
p4505
aS'[00:17] <LordHoto> Did somebody ever make use of the debug symbols in some of the m68k Mac executables?\n'
p4506
aS'[00:17] <[md5]> yes\n'
p4507
aS"[00:18] <[md5]> that's what is being used for work on the newer versions\n"
p4508
aS'[00:18] <[md5]> wjp managed to map all of the debug symbols onto the SQ6 executable\n'
p4509
aS'[00:18] <[md5]> which is probably our best target for SCI2-SCI2.1\n'
p4510
aS"[00:18] <[md5]> cause it was using almost all of the engine's functionality\n"
p4511
aS'[00:18] <[md5]> and it was one of the last SCI2.1 games\n'
p4512
aS"[00:19] <[md5]> that's what snover is using for his work\n"
p4513
aS'[00:19] <m_kiewitz> LordHoto: maybe clone? i think i own exactly 2 sierra mac games. QfG1 (SCI) and Gold Rush\n'
p4514
aS'[00:19] <LordHoto> Right, wjp mapped them onto the DOS executable\n'
p4515
aS'[00:19] <[md5]> yep\n'
p4516
aS"[00:19] <m_kiewitz> ah he did? didn't know that\n"
p4517
aS'[00:19] <[md5]> so yes, that was some wonderful work from a lot of people\n'
p4518
aS"[00:19] <[md5]> unless I'm forgetting someone, wjp, LordHoto and fuzzie\n"
p4519
aS'[00:20] <m_kiewitz> oh and another thing that was introduced with SCI in ScummVM is the runtime patching, the signatures and the workarounds\n'
p4520
aS'[00:20] <LordHoto> I was wondering whether that was put into some use :-P\n'
p4521
aS'[00:20] <[md5]> yeah :) and thanks for all that tremendous work to make all of that happen\n'
p4522
aS'[00:20] <m_kiewitz> especially the runtime patching is really nice that way we can fix game bugs without major issues and without adding lots of silly code\n'
p4523
aS'[00:21] <[md5]> oh yes, the runtime patcher\n'
p4524
aS'[00:21] <[md5]> the SCI engine turned out to be quite a beast :P\n'
p4525
aS"[00:21] <[md5]> and don't forget the automated checks for engine feature\n"
p4526
aS"[00:21] <m_kiewitz> fuzzie helped a lot on trying to figure out the weird macintosh sci0 games as well. we haven't fully implemented those yet\n"
p4527
aS'[00:21] <[md5]> s\n'
p4528
aS'[00:22] <m_kiewitz> there are like 2 or 3 games, that use some weird resolution, like 1.5x of the regular 320x200 resolution. 480x300\n'
p4529
aS'[00:22] <[md5]> e.g. SQ3 has all sorts of versions, that are using slightly different features\n'
p4530
aS'[00:22] <LordHoto> well Macintosh is probably the most annoying thing ever\n'
p4531
aS'[00:22] <m_kiewitz> and sierra changed the background drawing code in all sorts of weird ways, but they still draw internally to 320x200\n'
p4532
aS'[00:23] <m_kiewitz> but when you use the regular logic, plenty of backgrounds are broken and it will obviously not work correctly\n'
p4533
aS'[00:23] <[md5]> I think they changed that with Phantasmagoria 2\n'
p4534
aS"[00:23] <[md5]> (the last SCI3 game to be released, if I'm not mistaken)\n"
p4535
aS'[00:24] <[md5]> LordHoto: so did you actually write a mini emulator to decode that m68k executable?\n'
p4536
aS'[00:24] <LordHoto> Yes.\n'
p4537
aS'[00:24] <[md5]> impressive. Kudos once again :)\n'
p4538
aS'[00:24] <m_kiewitz> [md5] was phantasmagoria 2 the last SCI game or RAMA?\n'
p4539
aS"[00:25] <m_kiewitz> we don't have a timestamp for phantasmagoria 2 yet\n"
p4540
aS'[00:25] <LordHoto> At least it works/worked for SQ6\n'
p4541
aS'[00:25] <LordHoto> :-P\n'
p4542
aS'[00:25] <LordHoto> and some other executables\n'
p4543
aS'[00:25] <fuzzie> yes, LordHoto is to blame entirely for everything I did\n'
p4544
aS'[00:25] <fuzzie> especially any bugs\n'
p4545
aS'[00:25] <LordHoto> but Macintosh is all a mess when it comes to executables\n'
p4546
aS'[00:25] <[md5]> I think that the executable with the debug symbols was Phantasmagoria 1 Mac\n'
p4547
aS'[00:26] <LordHoto> fuzzie: bugs? there are no bugs!\n'
p4548
aS'[00:26] <[md5]> never!\n'
p4549
aS"[00:26] <[md5]> Phantasmagoria 2 was using some stuff that wasn't present in other games\n"
p4550
aS'[00:26] <[md5]> like a working windows-like environment\n'
p4551
aS'[00:27] <[md5]> and smarter usage of in-game sprites based on videos\n'
p4552
aS'[00:27] <[md5]> oh, and 16-bit color videos (but the actual game was using 256 colors)\n'
p4553
aS'[00:28] <m_kiewitz> it had 16-bit color videos? nice\n'
p4554
aS'[00:28] <[md5]> yeah\n'
p4555
aS"[00:28] <fuzzie> LordHoto: which reminds me that your loader still doesn't support that executable that walks the resource table itself manually\n"
p4556
aS'[00:28] <[md5]> DUCK encoding\n'
p4557
aS'[00:28] <[md5]> that is already supported - clone2727 was working on that\n'
p4558
aS"[00:28] <m_kiewitz> i think phantasmagoria 2 is probably one of the only sci32 that I'm still missing\n"
p4559
aS'[00:28] <m_kiewitz> sci32 games\n'
p4560
aS"[00:28] <LordHoto> fuzzie: No wonder. Because I didn't work on it in years :-P\n"
p4561
aS"[00:29] <LordHoto> fuzzie: I'll need to RE some system functions one day to assure they work as on a real MacOS...\n"
p4562
aS'[00:29] <snover> m_kiewitz: i wouldnt say youre missing anything ;)\n'
p4563
aS"[00:29] <fuzzie> LordHoto: yes so basically I'm anxiously awaiting your 100% accuracy MacOS emulator\n"
p4564
aS'[00:29] <[md5]> RAMA was released on November 1996, same as Phantasmagoria 2\n'
p4565
aS'[00:29] <fuzzie> LordHoto: please write it in javascript for ease-of-use.\n'
p4566
aS"[00:29] <m_kiewitz> snover: well, it's pretty crazy that I bought Police Quest: SWAT before it. I'm sure that SWAT is worse than Phantasmagoria 2\n"
p4567
aS'[00:30] <snover> well, they both involve handcuffs\n'
p4568
aS'[00:30] <[md5]> haha :D true\n'
p4569
aS'[00:30] <[md5]> the first SWAT was a bit older\n'
p4570
aS"[00:30] <LordHoto> fuzzie: I'll write it in OCaml\n"
p4571
aS'[00:30] <[md5]> it was released in 1995\n'
p4572
aS"[00:30] <[md5]> well, there's that crazy dude who wrote that Javascript transcoder\n"
p4573
aS'[00:31] <[md5]> emscripten\n'
p4574
aS"[00:31] <fuzzie> emscripten is basically the standard way to write high-perf js now, y'know.. :)\n"
p4575
aS'[00:32] <m_kiewitz> do the videos of phantasmagoria 2 work already?\n'
p4576
aS'[00:32] <snover> emscripten leads the path to a brighter future where you dont have to deal with ecma tc39s nonsense any more :)\n'
p4577
aS'[00:32] <[md5]> it is? :O nice!\n'
p4578
aS'[00:32] <[md5]> m_kiewitz: yes\n'
p4579
aS'[00:32] <snover> anyway, [md5], thank you for saying some of the history, it is interesting\n'
p4580
aS"[00:32] <fuzzie> no, it's terrible\n"
p4581
aS'[00:33] <m_kiewitz> [md5] damn, would have liked to implement it :P\n'
p4582
aS'[00:33] Action: [md5] slaps fuzzie with a large smelly trout\n'
p4583
aS'[00:33] <fuzzie> but I write asm.js nowadays without emscripten so I am biased :P\n'
p4584
aS'[00:33] <[md5]> "Emscripten has already been used to convert a very long list of real-world codebases to JavaScript, including large projects like CPython, Poppler and the Bullet Physics Engine, as well as commercial projects like the Unreal Engine 4 and the Unity engine"\n'
p4585
aS"[00:33] <m_kiewitz> hmm, yahtzee just said that Phantasmagoria 2 is a bit like Jacob's ladder and that's actually a great movie :P\n"
p4586
aS'[00:33] <m_kiewitz> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mq0IUSMzd1A\n'
p4587
aS'[00:33] <fuzzie> [md5]: yes, I was not joking :/\n'
p4588
aS"[00:34] <m_kiewitz> i did't know yahtzee did a let's drown on it\n"
p4589
aS'[00:34] <[md5]> fuzzie: heh :)\n'
p4590
aS'[00:34] <fuzzie> in future it will target WebAssembly (with some WebAssembly->asm.js polyfill)\n'
p4591
aS'[00:34] <[md5]> it is quite impressive that they managed to convert complex 3D engines into JS\n'
p4592
aS"[00:35] <[md5]> I don't know how pointer juggling is handled\n"
p4593
aS"[00:35] <[md5]> but it's impressive, nonetheless\n"
p4594
aS'[00:35] <fuzzie> there is a huge typed array which acts as a heap\n'
p4595
aS'[00:35] <[md5]> oh\n'
p4596
aS'[00:35] <snover> iirc you cannot resize it \n'
p4597
aS'[00:35] <fuzzie> so pointers are just indexes into it\n'
p4598
aS'[00:36] <fuzzie> well, you could resize it for a small amount of time\n'
p4599
aS'[00:36] <fuzzie> before someone noticed that V8 performance is way worse\n'
p4600
aS'[00:36] Action: fuzzie sniffles\n'
p4601
aS'[00:36] <fuzzie> but at some point threads will work and we can port scummvm into it wholesale\n'
p4602
aS'[00:37] <[md5]> threads? eh?\n'
p4603
aS'[00:37] <[md5]> in JS?\n'
p4604
aS'[00:37] <snover> threadsish. shared memory across worker processes\n'
p4605
aS'[00:37] <fuzzie> that is enough to implement threads :)\n'
p4606
aS'[00:38] <fuzzie> especially since scummvm only needs one thread..\n'
p4607
aS'[00:38] <[md5]> well, techically two\n'
p4608
aS'[00:38] <[md5]> (one for the audio)\n'
p4609
aS"[00:38] <fuzzie> we don't *need* the audio thread, but yes :)\n"
p4610
aS'[00:38] <[md5]> true\n'
p4611
aS'[00:39] <[md5]> still, audio works in emscripten\n'
p4612
aS"[00:39] <LordHoto> NDS didn't have an audio thread\n"
p4613
aS"[00:39] <[md5]> it didn't? so how did audio work there?\n"
p4614
aS"[00:39] <LordHoto> It's updated on delayMillis, and other calls\n"
p4615
aS"[00:39] <fuzzie> the bad news is that afaik the SharedMemoryBuffer stuff isn't going to be implemented everywhere any time soon\n"
p4616
aS"[00:40] <LordHoto> so, if an engine doesn't call something regularly, it breaks\n"
p4617
aS'[00:40] <LordHoto> to the extend that you have busy loops waiting for audio to finish breaking your game\n'
p4618
aS'[00:40] <fuzzie> the good news is that ChakraCore will be open source real soon now, so the javascript future is oddly bright\n'
p4619
aS'[00:40] <snover> man. one of the reasons i am working on scummvm is so i can get *away* from javascript :)\n'
p4620
aS'[00:41] <[md5]> :P\n'
p4621
aS'[00:41] <fuzzie> :D\n'
p4622
aS'[00:41] <[md5]> well, people are getting mad over Javascript\n'
p4623
aS'[00:41] <[md5]> node.js and the like\n'
p4624
aS'[00:41] <[md5]> the MEAN stack\n'
p4625
aS'[00:41] <[md5]> etc etc\n'
p4626
aS'[00:41] <snover> my career has been mostly in full stack web development and in the last couple of years it has become a total nightmare\n'
p4627
aS'[00:42] <[md5]> how come?\n'
p4628
aS'[00:42] <LordHoto> snover: Just write TypeScript.\n'
p4629
aS'[00:42] <[md5]> or CoffeeScript!\n'
p4630
aS'[00:42] <snover> LordHoto: i wrote the umd implementation for typescript :\\\n'
p4631
aS'[00:43] <LordHoto> snover: fun\n'
p4632
aS'[00:43] <snover> trends and buzzwords has always been a problem in technology but its particularly bad in web right now. probably like when java became super popular and was going to save the world\n'
p4633
aS'[00:43] <LordHoto> I only briefly looked at TypeScript when I was working on Flow :-P\n'
p4634
aS'[00:44] <snover> so you have standards committees like tc39 saying hey were going to release a new language spec every year, with backwards-incompatible syntax changes, enjoy\n'
p4635
aS'[00:44] <[md5]> :/\n'
p4636
aS'[00:44] <ScummBot> Port build status changed with 6d2dca8c: 03Success: master-mingw-w32, master-openpandora, master-debian-x86-clang\n'
p4637
aS'[00:44] <snover> and then you have people that cant see more than 6 months into the past constantly repeating mistakes and reinventing things that were already well solved\n'
p4638
aS'[00:44] <[md5]> well, browser vendors are trying to kill Java applets with pitchforks nowadays\n'
p4639
aS"[00:45] <LordHoto> snover: So how's that different from anything else?\n"
p4640
aS'[00:45] <snover> one of my favourite examples is that there are 525-or-so libraries in node.js package manager for parsing command line arguments\n'
p4641

aS'[03:38] <snover> where are the keys for opening the scummvm debugger in the source? im searching, just havent found them yet. the ctrl-d is not working for me\n'
p4986
aS'[03:47] <dreammaster> snover. Just double-checked, and the SCI engine, at least, uses Control-Shift-D\n'
p4987
aS'[03:48] <snover> dreammaster: thanks. i was going crazy. did not even think to check the specific engine, which i guess is obvious in hindsight\n'
p4988
aS'[03:49] <dreammaster> NP :)\n'
p4989
aS'[03:53] <snover> is there any good way to room hop in an original copy of the engine so i can compare outputs?\n'
p4990
aS'[03:57] <dreammaster> Well, the only SCI game that I know of that has a teleport in the original is Quest for Glory 2, with the "suck blue frog" cheat\n'
p4991
aS'[03:57] <snover> mm, alright. i saw a mention of a debug room in one of these scripts\n'
p4992
aS'[03:57] <snover> so maybe i just need to edit the first room script to jump to the debug room\n'
p4993
aS'[04:08] <lskovlun> snover: many sci32 games allow you to enter the debug mode by creating a file called "classes" in the game dir\n'

aS'[04:38] <snover> woo, palette varying is working!\n'
p5001
aS'[04:43] <snover> and the answer to what it is doing on the first screen of sq6: it is making roger lighter and darker when he walks in and out of the light\n'
p5002
aS'[04:44] <snover> there seems to be some kind of blending problem with the vapour that comes out of his mouth in the basement bar. in the actual engine it looks almost transparent, in scummvm it is &mostly garbage colours\n'
p5003
aS'[04:45] <snover> possibly underflowing\n'
p5004
aS"[04:45] <lskovlun> sure it's not RemapColors?\n"
p5005
aS'[04:45] <lskovlun> not implemented yet in ScummVM\n'
p5006
aS'[04:45] <snover> isnt RemapColors just for the Windows palette limitation workaround?\n'
p5007
aS'[04:46] <snover> or is it used for other stuff? because yeah, that is still the last thing not implemented\n'
p5008
aS'[04:46] <snover> in the palette manager\n'
p5009
aS'[04:46] <lskovlun> no, RemapColors does things like transparency and grayscale mapping\n'
p5010
aS'[04:46] <lskovlun> another example is the sunbeam in Schloss Ritter (GK1)\n'
p5011
aS'[04:46] <snover> ah, ok. then yeah that sounds like it is probably it!\n'
p5012
aS'[04:47] <snover> i guess i will write that next x)\n'
p5013
aS'[04:47] <lskovlun> good luck! :)\n'

p5016
aS'[04:50] <snover> looking at the disassembly this doesnt look terrible. its no kFrameOut. which i am going to make someone else do for me that has a decompiler. ;)\n'
p5017
aS"[04:55] <lskovlun> it doesn't look terrible because it the grunt work is done inside kFrameOut :)\n"

p5766
aS'[17:32] <snover> no, the roms fell into this weird legal hole caused by the berne convention implementation act of 1988\n'
p5767
aS'[17:32] <snover> basically there was a need for them to reregister copyright and they never did\n'
p5768
aS'[17:33] <fuzzie> well, this is in .us only?\n'
p5769
aS'[17:33] <snover> probably so\n'

p5771
aS"[17:33] <LordHoto> well, we aren't in US :-)\n"
p5772
aS'[17:33] <salty-horse> is that steam diff something the ScummVM community made, or did they?\n'
p5773
aS'[17:34] <Henke37> meanwhile windows still has gm.dls\n'
p5774
aS'[17:34] <Henke37> tewnty year old or so?\n'
p5775
aS"[17:34] <LordHoto> So, looks like there're changes to MT-32 code related to ROMs.\n"
p5776
aS"[17:35] <fuzzie> you'd think GPL licensing wouldn't be that hard to understand\n"
p5777
aS'[17:36] <LordHoto> Someone would need to check that.\n'
p5778
aS'[17:36] <LordHoto> But that looks dubious to me.\n'
p5779
aS'[17:37] <Henke37> 1. You must provide the source code to everything, if someone asks. 2. You must grant the same rights you have to people you distribute to.\n'
p5780
aS"[17:38] <fuzzie> you're forgetting the bit about giving us chocolate\n"
p5781
aS'[17:39] <LordHoto> Looks like they definitely hardcoded the ROM file handling.\n'
p5782
aS'[17:39] <LordHoto> And they stripped the data.\n'
p5783
aS'[17:40] <LordHoto> That looks like a violation.\n'
p5784
aS'[17:40] <fuzzie> it is actually there in their builds?\n'
p5785
aS"[17:40] <LordHoto> I didn't check that yet\n"
p5786
aS"[17:40] <LordHoto> but there's:\n"
p5787
aS'[17:40] <LordHoto> _controlFile = new Common::MemoryFile(mt32_control_rom, 65536);\n'
p5788
aS'[17:40] <LordHoto> _pcmFile = new Common::MemoryFile(mt32_pcm_rom, 524288);\n'
p5789
aS'[17:41] <fuzzie> well, one optimistic way to think about it\n'
p5790
aS"[17:41] <fuzzie> would be that they realised they can't distribute it, and removed it from their internal tree\n"
p5791
aS'[17:41] <LordHoto> and the ROM files they added are "empty", i.e. the arrays contain no data and the applyCopyrightProtection is stubbed out\n'
p5792
aS"[17:42] <LordHoto> it's odd that they mention it in their README file about building the sources\n"
p5793
aS'[17:42] <LordHoto> If someone has a binary, it would be interesting to search for the data.\n'
p5794
aS'[17:43] <LordHoto> Probably their "applyCopyrightProtection" method "decrypts" the data, so you can\'t extract it easily.\n'
p5795
aS'[17:43] <fuzzie> oh I see, the Android release has this readme\n'
p5796
aS'[17:44] <Raziel^> glad to see you back fuzzie\n'
p5797
aS'[17:44] <LordHoto> But yeah, if someone with a binary could look for that, that would be interesting to know.\n'
p5798
aS"[17:47] <Henke37> yeah, code that decrypts data is probably not going to be gpl compatible, if the data file doesn't exist in source form\n"

p5903
aS'[22:08] <[md5]> snover: to check where each kernel function is called from, you can use ScummVM\'s debugger (Control-Shift-D) and type "find_callk KernelCall"\n'

aS'[22:08] <[md5]> e.g. "find_callk MorphOn"\n'

p5907
aS'[22:09] <[md5]> yeah, I added that\n'
p5908
aS'[22:09] <snover> or sould i just move it from the table to somewhere more obvious?\n'
p5909
aS'[22:09] <[md5]> feel free to move it in the function stub itself now\n'
p5910
aS'[22:09] <snover> ok\n'
p5911
aS'[22:09] <snover> i will embellish it a little more too\n'
p5912

p5929
aS'[22:16] <[md5]> perhaps the same code can be used for both?\n'
p5930
aS'[22:17] <snover> the only duplication are the difference calculation lines, otherwise they are subtly different :(\n'
p5931
aS'[22:17] <[md5]> also, why are seconds not accurate enough?\n'
p5932
aS'[22:18] <[md5]> um, also\n'
p5933
aS'[22:18] <[md5]> in kernelFindColor, r, g and b are 16-bit integers\n'

aS'[22:19] <m_kiewitz> no changes to kernelFindColor and such please :P it was a nightmare to get those working perfectly\n'

p5937
aS'[22:19] <snover> there are parts of the engine that run on ticks, like palVary and the palette cyclers, and expect those values to never go backwards\n'

p5950

p5951
aS"[22:21] <[md5]> I mean, it's not doing anything to these variables\n"

aS"[22:21] <[md5]> so I think it's a bit confusing to have it?\n"

p5970
aS'[22:28] <[md5]> hm\n'
p5971
aS'[22:28] <[md5]> are you sure that kernelFindColor() returns the best result now?\n'
p5972
aS'[22:28] <[md5]> the one for SCI16 is trying to find the color closest to a given (r, g, b) triplet\n'
p5973
aS'[22:29] <[md5]> hm, I think that the end result is the same?\n'
p5974
aS'[22:30] <[md5]> the existing one does:\n'
p5975
aS'[22:30] <[md5]> differenceTotal = differenceRed + differenceGreen + differenceBlue;\n'

p5979
aS'[22:30] <[md5]> }\n'
p5980
aS'[22:30] <[md5]> yours is doing the same, but in more steps\n'
p5981
aS'[22:30] <snover> I am pretty sure it correctly implements the algorithm that the engine uses, whether or not that algorithm is correct is sierras fault :)\n'
p5982
aS'[22:31] <[md5]> but I think that the code yields the same result?\n'
p5983
aS"[22:31] <[md5]> i.e. we're doing:\n"
p5984
aS'[22:31] <snover> In theory this algorithm would be faster because it shortcuts if one of the channels is already less of a match\n'
p5985
aS'[22:31] <[md5]> yeah\n'
p5986
aS'[22:31] <[md5]> true\n'
p5987
aS"[22:32] <[md5]> but the difference is negligible in today's systems...\n"
p5988
aS'[22:32] <m_kiewitz> you have to very careful, sierra even introduced a glitch at some point and causes a color in sq5 do be "incorrect"\n'
p5989
aS'[22:32] <snover> m_kiewitz: yes, i reviewed that ticket\n'
p5990
aS'[22:32] <m_kiewitz> and we have to replicate that glitch\n'
p5991
aS'[22:32] <m_kiewitz> was a hell to figure out\n'
p5992
aS'[22:32] <snover> it is one of the reasons why i just went ahead and reimplemented the sierra algorithm\n'
p5993
aS'[22:33] <[md5]> the code is the same, but it short circuits a bit earlier\n'
p5994
aS'[22:33] <snover> oh you know what\n'
p5995
aS'[22:33] <[md5]> actually\n'
p5996
aS'[22:33] <[md5]> hm\n'
p5997
aS"[22:33] <m_kiewitz> i would be glad if that code would get used for sci32 only for now, i don't want to optimize stuff that could break sci16\n"

p5999
aS'[22:33] <[md5]> not the same\n'

p6002
aS"[22:34] <[md5]> but now it's:\n"
p6003
aS'[22:34] <[md5]> difference = (_sysPalette.colors[i].r - r) * 2;\n'
p6004
aS'[22:34] <snover> No I made a mistake, I transcribed `imul edx, edx` as `add edx, edx`\n'
p6005
aS'[22:34] <snover> nice catch :)\n'
p6006
aS'[22:34] <[md5]> :)\n'
p6007
aS'[22:35] <snover> The back part of my brain was like I dont see how this doesnt get the wrong value if the difference is negative\n'

p6009
aS'[22:35] <snover> duh\n'

aS'[22:37] <[md5]> snover: so, are they using the same code as in SCI1.1 for color matching?\n'
p6012
aS'[22:37] <[md5]> seems like it?\n'
p6013
aS'[22:37] <snover> i thought sci1.1 was the buggy one?\n'
p6014
aS'[22:37] <[md5]> or are they multiplying every difference by two now?\n'
p6015
aS'[22:37] <m_kiewitz> yes, sci1.1 is buggy\n'

aS'[22:44] <[md5]> it looks surprisingly similar\n'

aS"[22:44] <m_kiewitz> hmm i doubt its fixed now, it's the other way not the upper limit\n"

p6079
aS"[22:56] <[md5]> ooh he's around\n"
p6080
aS'[22:56] <[md5]> hello wjp :)\n'
p6081
aS'[22:57] <[md5]> ok, the original implementation of the SCI1.1 color matching code was sort of finalized in this commit:\n'
p6082
aS'[22:57] <[md5]> https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/commit/28967b617f53dbda91d549007dc8af2581dbae3a\n'
p6083
aS'[22:57] <[md5]> by m_kiewitz and wjp\n'
p6084
aS'[22:57] <[md5]> now, snover has created another version of matchColor()\n'
p6085
aS'[22:58] <[md5]> oh\n'
p6086
aS'[22:58] <[md5]> and he has now updated it as he said\n'
p6087
aS'[22:58] <[md5]> https://github.com/csnover/scummvm/commit/1e99eb40672e97cb532c7555ff8f3eb941247a0c\n'
p6088
aS'[22:58] <[md5]> which looks to be doing the same?\n'
p6089
aS'[22:58] <[md5]> or am I missing something?\n'
p6090
aS'[22:59] <snover> it was `difference += channelDifference * 2` before which was a silly mistake i made\n'
p6091
aS'[22:59] <m_kiewitz> [md5] can you load the eq1 german saved game? my scummvm crashes when i try to load it\n'
p6092
aS'[22:59] <wjp> [md5]: huh?\n'
p6093
aS'[22:59] <snover> so a couple difference i can note are 1. SCI32 checks only 236 colours not all 256 colours\n'
p6094
aS'[22:59] <[md5]> m_kiewitz: I just tried the French version, and the bug is still there without the workaround\n'
p6095
aS"[23:00] <[md5]> snover: yeah, sorry, that's another difference too\n"
p6096
aS"[23:00] <m_kiewitz> damn, i can't even check because the save crashes\n"
p6097
aS'[23:00] <snover> 2. SCI32 doesnt have some 8-bit integer overflow bug, it operates in full 32-bit registers\n'
p6098
aS"[23:00] <[md5]> wjp: is there something that I'm not explaining correctly?\n"
p6099
aS'[23:00] <wjp> see what snover is saying\n'
p6100
aS'[23:01] <wjp> the version m_kiewitz and I added explicitly states it has a bug that we need to reproduce\n'
p6101
aS'[23:01] <[md5]> ok\n'
p6102
aS'[23:01] <[md5]> so we need to set _use16bitColorMatch to false for SCI32\n'
p6103
aS'[23:01] <[md5]> er\n'
p6104
aS'[23:01] <[md5]> to true\n'
p6105
aS"[23:01] <[md5]> right now it's false\n"
p6106
aS'[23:02] <snover> 3. SCI32 returns the calculated difference in matchColor through an outparam so it cannot be implemented any different (i.e. by using abs instead of squaring)\n'
p6107
aS'[23:02] <snover> differently*\n'
p6108
aS'[23:03] <snover> I mean I suppose it is possible those values are only ever compared against one another in which case it would be safe, but I have not implemented Remap yet, which is where this second version is called\n'
p6109
aS'[23:04] <snover> [md5]: I dont think _use16bitColorMatch is relevant any more since this is a virtual method override and so that flag is not used by any code in ScummVM when running a SCI32 game, I think.\n'
p6110
aS"[23:04] <[md5]> um, I don't see that version of matchColor() be used?\n"
p6111
aS'[23:05] <[md5]> used *\n'
p6112
aS'[23:05] <snover> yeah it is dead at the moment because Remap is not implemented yet\n'
p6113
aS'[23:05] <[md5]> ok\n'
p6114
aS'[23:05] <[md5]> so it also returns the difference\n'
p6115
aS'[23:05] <[md5]> we can review it once Remap is done, I suppose\n'
p6116
aS'[23:05] <snover> its a little crappy and i am sorry about that, i am trying to still bridge the gap between now and full SCI32 implementation\n'
p6117
aS"[23:05] <wjp> let's first keep things close to the original to see if things work, before starting extensive refactoring\n"
p6118
aS'[23:06] <[md5]> ok\n'
p6119
aS'[23:06] <[md5]> no worrie\n'
p6120
aS'[23:06] <[md5]> s\n'
p6121
aS"[23:06] <wjp> it'll just come back to haunt us if we need to trace differences with the original through steps of refactoring\n"
p6122
aS'[23:07] <[md5]> fair enough, we can just add a TODO for now, to check for possible code refactoring afterwards\n'
p6123
aS'[23:09] <snover> I will add TODO on matchColor, but kernelFindColor is complete, so if you have a concern about that we should address it now I guess :)\n'
p6124
aS'[23:09] <[md5]> nah, just add a TODO for future reference and leave it as is\n'
p6125
aS"[23:10] <[md5]> we'll check it again when it's actually used and tested\n"
p6126
aS'[23:10] <snover> ok\n'
p6127
aS'[23:11] <[md5]> once you add that, it looks OK to merge\n'

aS'[19:21] <snover> anyway having some of the basic stuff in place in an idb will be helpful later on so might as well just do it\n'
p6670
aS'[19:21] <[md5]> you can test GK1, each room change is using 13 / 14 (fade out/in)\n'
p6671
aS'[19:21] <snover> then i can hopefully verify im not skipping anything important when i write the implementation\n'

aS'[19:42] <[md5]> well, the incomplete functions call kStub(), apart from kFrameOut and related functions\n'

p6716
aS"[19:44] <[md5]> that's the main difference\n"
p6717
aS'[19:44] <snover> theres a related table of values set by kSetPalStyleRange\n'
p6718
aS'[19:45] <snover> i suspect there is probably some overengineering in the sci engine since they gutted the feature\n'

p6722
aS"[19:50] <[md5]> well, that's the main thing that was rewritten for SCI32\n"
p6723
aS'[19:50] <[md5]> together with others\n'
p6724
aS'[19:51] <[md5]> but that was the major part of the engine that was rewritten\n'
p6725
aS'[19:55] <lskovlun> Well, that and the GUI code (planes/screen items/...)\n'
p6726
aS'[19:56] <lskovlun> the memory manager was rewritten too, there is no "heap" as such anymore\n'
p6727
aS'[19:56] <lskovlun> much like in our VM\n'
p6728
aS'[19:57] <[md5]> well, there was a heap in SC2+\n'
p6729
aS'[19:57] <[md5]> sort of\n'
p6730
aS'[19:57] <lskovlun> not in the sense that there are no pointers\n'
p6731
aS'[19:58] <[md5]> yeah, true\n'
p6732
aS"[19:58] <lskovlun> you can't do the sort of pointer jockeying they did earlier\n"
p6733
aS'[19:58] <[md5]> with kMemory\n'
p6734
aS'[19:58] <lskovlun> yeah\n'
p6735
aS'[19:58] <[md5]> some of the stuff was rewritten into kListEachElementDo\n'
p6736
aS'[19:59] <lskovlun> technically, they had this earlier in the ListOps kernel call, which was however not used\n'
p6737
aS"[20:00] <[md5]> also, it's still amazing to see that the current VM works from SCI0 up to SCI2.1\n"

aS'[07:43] <snover> lskovlun: i dont know what that is, and it seems to be greyed out\n'
p6884
aS'[07:45] <lskovlun> it seems to me it would cover the situation you describe, basically if a function consists of unconnected chunks, the autoanalysis can detect it and flag one chunk as a "tail" of the other...\n'
p6885
aS'[07:46] <lskovlun> if IDA gets it wrong you can use add/remove function tail\n'
p6886
aS'[07:48] <snover> ill see if i can make it work\n'
p6887
aS'[07:49] <snover> it jumps first to just a block of code, thats ok, but then it jumps into the middle of another subroutine\n'

aS"[07:50] <lskovlun> I haven't looked at the dos version myself\n"
p6894
aS'[07:53] <snover> well thanks for the insight, that at least completes the function\n'
p6895
aS'[07:54] <snover> its pretty special i gotta say\n'
p6896
aS'[07:55] <snover> much more exciting than the SCI::Run from SQ6 :)\n'
p6897
aS'[07:59] <snover> lskovlun: you have a disassembly of phant2 for windows?\n'
p6898
aS'[08:00] <lskovlun> not phantas2, no\n'
p6899
aS'[08:00] <lskovlun> what are you looking for in it?\n'
p6900
aS'[08:00] <snover> eventually looking to verify that only kSetShowStyles 0, 1, 13, and 14 are available\n'
p6901
aS'[08:01] <snover> figured as long as im here i might as well get some of the surrounding code set up to make it easier for anyone in the future\n'
p6902
aS'[08:01] <snover> SCI::Run is just very curious, and its referenced from three vtables which is also& curious\n'
p6903
aS"[08:03] <lskovlun> that's because SCI is a subclass\n"
p6904
aS'[08:03] <snover> one of the tables is SCIDOS and that one is pretty obvious\n'
p6905
aS'[08:03] <snover> one of them is SCI superclass\n'
p6906
aS'[08:03] <snover> which is mostly purevirtual functions\n'
p6907
aS'[08:03] <snover> then there is this third one which is also mostly purevirtual functions\n'
p6908
aS'[08:04] <snover> My first guess would be that its Saveable, but such a table shouldnt reference SCI::Run or SCI::Init\n'
p6909
aS'[08:08] <snover> My second guess is that its SCIWIN but that seems& uh\n'
p6910
aS"[08:09] <lskovlun> I count 8 different entries in that jump table (if I'm looking at the right one)\n"
p6911
aS'[08:09] <lskovlun> so 8 show styles\n'
p6912
aS'[08:10] <lskovlun> out of 16\n'
p6913
aS'[08:11] <lskovlun> the function is at 4338A0\n'
p6914
aS'[08:12] <snover> lskovlun: you are looking at phant2 dos?\n'
p6915
aS'[08:12] <lskovlun> phant2 win\n'
p6916
aS'[08:12] <snover> oh ok\n'
p6917
aS'[08:12] <snover> sorry i was confused because you said you didnt have one :)\n'
p6918
aS"[08:13] <lskovlun> well, it's not complete... but I have scripts so I can set up a working environment for any SCI3/Win interp I need to look at\n"
p6919
aS'[08:13] <snover> I dont see any jump table in kSetShowStyle for the version I have\n'
p6920
aS'[08:14] <lskovlun> I was looking at the function that performs the style (ProcessStyles?)\n'
p6921
aS'[08:14] <snover> ah, ok, yeah, I am still searching for that\n'
p6922
aS'[08:15] <snover> there it is.\n'
p6923
aS'[08:15] <snover> 7be70 here\n'
p6924
aS'[08:16] <snover> and & I dont see any jump table again\n'
p6925
aS'[08:16] <snover> there are a couple of indirect calls, might be in one of those\n'
p6926
aS'[08:25] <t0by> Strangerke, please poke me and annoy me about those translation strings. They nearly slipped off my mind.\n'
p6927
aS'[08:29] <lskovlun> snover: the jump instruction is at 7c0c4?\n'
p6928
aS'[08:31] <snover> lskovlun: yes, officially i should stop for the night :) its another one of these places where the compiler jumps to somewhere else in the middle of a subroutine\n'
p6929
aS'[08:31] <snover> which i totally missed&\n'
p6930
aS'[08:32] <lskovlun> mine calls all of it 7be70\n'
p6931

p6932
aS'[08:33] <snover> https://zetafleet.com/i/569a002e1e1a0.png it is supposed to be here\n'
p6933
aS'[08:35] <snover> IDA decided to end the subroutine in the middle, I fixed it now and its all showing up as expected\n'
p6934
aS'[08:35] <snover> and, yeah! more opcodes than SQ6.\n'
p6935
aS'[08:36] <snover> 7 unique instead of 3 unique\n'

p7031
aS'[17:40] <snover> looks like phant2 and lighthouse have the same ones, but theyre different from sq6\n'
p7032
aS'[17:40] <snover> so now the question is& do other sci21 games have the sq6 styles or the sci3 styles\n'

p7063
aS'[19:22] <snover> hm. implementing kSetShowStyle is more of a problem than i expected because it involves parts of the original engine that were architected not the same way in ScummVM. For example the plane list in ScummVM is a Common::List but in SCI it was a fixed-size pointer array. Should I be changing ScummVM to match or just try to stick to the ScummVM design? I just dont have enough experience to know if trying to keep it the way it is is going to come back an\n'
p7064
aS'[19:23] <m_kiewitz> i would change that for now then to match the original interpreter\n'
p7065
aS'[19:23] <m_kiewitz> so there was a hard limit for planes?\n'
p7066
aS'[19:24] <snover> yeah, up to 100\n'
p7067
aS"[19:24] <m_kiewitz> just change it, it doesn't matter, because planes are sci32 only\n"
p7068
aS'[19:25] <m_kiewitz> if it affected stuff from sci16, it would be a different matter\n'
p7069
aS'[19:25] <wjp> the current plane/frameout SCI32 graphics code in scummvm was hacked together; feel free to completely redesign/overhaul it\n'
p7070
aS'[19:25] <snover> Im sure someone famous once said 100 planes ought to be enough for anybody\n'
p7071
aS'[19:25] <m_kiewitz> i guess they did that for performance reasons probably\n'
p7072
aS'[19:26] <snover> that was my thinking as well\n'
p7073
aS'[19:28] <snover> anyway, thanks for your feedback, i will follow the original engine design here\n'
p7074
aS'[19:29] <m_kiewitz> did they sort the list when you added a new plane?\n'

p7078
aS'[19:33] <m_kiewitz> what they are doing with them?\n'
p7079
aS"[19:33] <m_kiewitz> i thought each plane was a layer on the screen, so for fading in/out that shouldn't be needed\n"
p7080
aS'[19:34] <snover> it seems show styles may be allowed to operate on individual planes, but i am only about 15% through the function yet (slow today!)\n'
p7081
aS'[19:36] <snover> m_kiewitz: i will be sure to let you know once i know more, or if i end up in kAddPlane i will let you know if i see it sorting when planes are added\n'
p7082
aS"[19:43] <lskovlun> I'm quite certain that the container classes should be preferred when the elements are objects\n"

aS'[00:44] <wjp> yeah\n'

aS"[00:50] <wjp> if there's a default value, it should return that\n"

aS"[00:51] <m_kiewitz> hmm it seems it doesn't\n"
p7196
aS'[00:51] <m_kiewitz> GAMEOPTION_DISABLE_MOUSE in detection.cpp is correctly defined, right (AGI)\n'
p7197
aS'[00:51] <wjp> are you sure the default declaration has been executed?\n'
p7198
aS'[00:51] <m_kiewitz> do you need to call something to do that?\n'
p7199
aS'[00:52] <snover> oh that reminds me there is some scrolling config setting that needs to be set to true by default\n'
p7200
aS'[00:52] <wjp> I think I need more context now\n'
p7201
aS'[00:52] <m_kiewitz> GAMEOPTION_DISABLE_MOUSE in detection.cpp\n'
p7202
aS"[00:52] <m_kiewitz> and it's checked in agi.cpp, although I'm not sure if my current code is the same in trunk\n"
p7203
aS'[00:52] <m_kiewitz> it\'s only a "if (!ConfMan.getBool("mousesupport")) {\n'

p7205
aS'[00:53] <m_kiewitz> nothing more than that anywhere\n'

aS'[00:53] <m_kiewitz> so if one needs to do another call, then that would explain it\n'
p7207
aS'[00:53] <m_kiewitz> still I see that DISABLE_MOUSE seems to be declared with a default value of true inside detection.cpp\n'
p7208
aS'[00:53] <wjp> oh, this is one of those ExtraGuiOption things\n'
p7209
aS"[00:54] <m_kiewitz> it's:\n"

p7213
aS'[00:54] <m_kiewitz> true\n'
p7214
aS'[00:54] <m_kiewitz> what\'s ExtraGuiOption? I thought "true" was the default?!\n'
p7215
aS'[00:54] <m_kiewitz> ah that actually is ExtraGuiOption\n'
p7216
aS'[00:56] <wjp> yes, those should get their defaults registered automatically\n'
p7217
aS"[00:56] <m_kiewitz> i think i now undestand somewhat what's happening\n"
p7218
aS'[00:56] <m_kiewitz> for lsl1 amiga I have disabled mousesupport\n'
p7219
aS"[00:56] <m_kiewitz> the option isn't shown for engine options\n"
p7220
aS"[00:56] <m_kiewitz> but shouldn't I still get the default in that case?\n"
p7221
aS"[00:56] <wjp> is it crashing in that check in agi.cpp, or in something you're adding?\n"
p7222
aS'[00:57] <m_kiewitz> lsl1 amiga is always supposed to have mouse support, which is why having a clickable option would be pointless\n'
p7223
aS"[00:57] <m_kiewitz> it's error()ing out during that check in agi.cpp, yes\n"
p7224
aS'[00:57] <wjp> ok, refreshed my memory\n'
p7225
aS"[00:58] <m_kiewitz> i could of course check for the platform and not check the option at all, but I think the current code shouldn't error() out\n"
p7226
aS"[00:58] <wjp> it's only registering the ones that are specified in the specific detection entry\n"

p7228
aS"[00:58] <m_kiewitz> ah, so when it's not registered, I don't get the default, even when it's defined in detection.cpp?\n"
p7229
aS'[00:58] <m_kiewitz> so i would have to check platform and not check the option for amiga?\n'
p7230
aS'[01:00] <wjp> well\n'
p7231
aS'[01:01] <wjp> the situation for this option is a bit annoying\n'
p7232
aS'[01:01] <wjp> there are more detection entries without this GAMEOPTION_DISABLE_MOUSE\n'
p7233
aS'[01:01] <wjp> was this check added recently?\n'
p7234
aS'[01:01] <m_kiewitz> which check? me disabling it for amiga agi games?\n'
p7235
aS'[01:02] <m_kiewitz> or the mouse setting boolean read?\n'
p7236
aS'[01:02] <snover> when you are done, do either of you know if Plane.gameRect from disassembly corresponds to PlaneEntry.planeRect or PlaneEntry.planeClipRect in ScummVM?\n'
p7237
aS'[01:02] <wjp> oh, I see a bunch of commits for this recently\n'
p7238
aS"[01:03] <m_kiewitz> well im not sure if the current code crashes, i think it doesn't. not sure if I commited the current code for disabling mouse option for amiga games\n"
p7239
aS"[01:03] <m_kiewitz> i think i haven't\n"
p7240
aS"[01:04] <lskovlun> snover: I honestly don't think we have that distinction in the current code... there's a coordinate transformation in there as well besides the clipping, right?\n"
p7241
aS'[01:04] <m_kiewitz> i reworked the whole agi graphics code and a bit on top of that, which also includes amiga/apple II GS transition, correct palettes for the platforms, fonts etc.\n'
p7242
aS"[01:05] <m_kiewitz> so I think it's only working that way in my local copy\n"
p7243
aS"[01:05] <LordHoto> wjp, m_kiewitz: The issue is that it queries the values in the engine's constructor.\n"
p7244
aS"[01:05] <LordHoto> The default values aren't registered at that point.\n"
p7245
aS"[01:05] <lskovlun> snover: yeah, it's a resolution transformation afaict\n"
p7246
aS'[01:06] <lskovlun> in Plane::ConvGameRectToPlaneRect I mean\n'
p7247
aS"[01:06] <wjp> LordHoto: but even elsewhere, wouldn't it be problematic since some games don't have those options?\n"
p7248
aS"[01:06] <m_kiewitz> LordHoto: ok, I have just added a platform check for Amiga, and it then doesn't check the option. I don't really like that though, because the option could in theory get enabled for a single game or something like that\n"
p7249
aS'[01:06] <LordHoto> wjp: It sets defaults for all entries of the engine.\n'
p7250
aS'[01:07] <m_kiewitz> and i would then have to check game-ids or something\n'
p7251
aS'[01:07] <LordHoto> wjp:  * If no target is specified, all of the available custom GUI options are\n'
p7252
aS'[01:07] <LordHoto>  * Returned for the plugin (used to set default values).\n'
p7253
aS'[01:07] <wjp> LordHoto: are you sure? Because the loop in AdvancedMetaEngine::getExtraGuiOptions seems to take a subset?\n'
p7254
aS'[01:07] <LordHoto> const ExtraGuiOptions engineOptions = (*plugin)->getExtraGuiOptions(Common::String()); from base/main.cpp\n'
p7255
aS"[01:07] <m_kiewitz> if the code would still register all options with their defaults, i wouldn't have to worry about it\n"

p7257
aS'[01:07] <snover> lskovlun: oh i see, thank you for pointing that out, i would have done the wrong thing here it seems :)\n'
p7258
aS"[01:07] <m_kiewitz> but it doesn't matter atm\n"
p7259
aS'[01:09] <LordHoto> wjp: that hits the case in 177-182 of engines/advancedDetector.cpp\n'

aS'[01:20] <m_kiewitz> anything else?\n'
p7282
aS'[01:21] <snover> no, actually, it looks like it might be unused code that the compiler couldnt remove\n'
p7283
aS'[01:22] <m_kiewitz> so there is only 1 gamerect and nothing else?!?!\n'
p7284
aS'[01:22] <snover> it copies gamerect into a local and then as far as i can tell never uses it again\n'
p7285
aS'[01:22] <snover> it looks like gk1 may have used it more than sq6\n'
p7286
aS'[01:22] <snover> so part of the last minute disabling of code in sci2.1 perhaps\n'
p7287
aS'[01:23] <snover> it seems unused in sci3 too\n'
p7288
aS'[01:23] <m_kiewitz> then i guess it is maybe planeRect\n'
p7289
aS'[01:23] <snover> even though the same operation to copy it off the plane into a local is there\n'
p7290
aS'[01:23] <m_kiewitz> we adust coordinates internally through various ways, so that we were able to easily use adjusted coordinates\n'
p7291
aS'[01:23] <m_kiewitz> some games are shown at higher resolution, but internally use 320x200\n'
p7292
aS'[01:24] <m_kiewitz> some other games are shown at high-res and also actually use high res for the scripts\n'
p7293
aS'[01:24] <snover> i learn something new :)\n'
p7294
aS'[01:24] <m_kiewitz> sierra used that approach plenty of times\n'
p7295
aS'[01:25] <m_kiewitz> for example Macintosh SCI0 games ran at 480x300 or something like that for display, but internally the scripts still saw the regular SCI0 resolution of 320x200\n'
p7296
aS'[01:25] <m_kiewitz> on top of that however, sierra changed background drawing to actually draw to this higher resolution\n'
p7297
aS'[01:26] <m_kiewitz> still they only changed some of the drawing code and if I remember it right, they drawing operations inside the background picture resource still used that lower resolution\n'
p7298
aS"[01:26] <m_kiewitz> so it's a 100% nightmare\n"
p7299
aS'[01:26] <m_kiewitz> s/they/the\n'
p7300
aS'[01:27] <m_kiewitz> ah and i even think that in sci32, it was possible to use different resolutions at the same time\n'
p7301
aS'[01:28] <m_kiewitz> for example the doors in larry 6, those are i think using a different resolution and are supposed to get stretched or something like that\n'
p7302
aS'[01:28] <m_kiewitz> im not really sure but it looked that way\n'
p7303
aS'[01:28] <snover> fun\n'
p7304
aS'[01:28] <m_kiewitz> the doors were never drawn properly\n'
p7305
aS'[01:28] <snover> there are plenty of scaling bugs to be fixed yet\n'
p7306
aS"[01:29] <m_kiewitz> i think we don't have figured out how scaling worked in sci32, or maybe there are some other script issues which cause those scaling issues to occur\n"
p7307
aS'[01:29] <m_kiewitz> for example gabriel knight 1, when ambulance drives away\n'
p7308
aS'[01:29] <snover> man i am having a terrible time with my brain today. ive forgotten& is reg_t the equivalent of MemID?\n'
p7309
aS'[01:29] <m_kiewitz> in sci1.1 scaling works properly though\n'

aS'[01:31] <m_kiewitz> LordHoto: worked, thank you very much\n'
p7311
aS'[01:32] <lskovlun> m_kiewitz: There is a resolution field in the view header in SCI32, yes\n'
p7312
aS'[01:34] <lskovlun> snover: Yes.\n'
p7313
aS'[01:34] <m_kiewitz> i guess scaling for sci32 should probably get implemented 100% the same. for sci1.1 scaling we use our own scaling algo, which works fine and sometimes results are better than with the original sierra one\n'
p7314
aS"[01:34] <LordHoto> m_kiewitz: You're welcome. That's much easier and more fun than trying to figure out linker issues :-P\n"
p7315
aS"[01:34] <m_kiewitz> for sci32 i wouldn't be surprised, if we would have to 100% reproduce the sierra scaling for pixel perfect accuracy otherwise we may get graphic errors\n"

p7815
aS'[00:47] <snover> it does look like sci resource viewer provides marginally more useful disassembly\n'
p7816
aS'[00:47] <wjp> you can build scummvm to run the debugger on the terminal as well, by the way\n'
p7817
aS'[00:47] <wjp> much more convenient IMO\n'

p8452
aS'[22:49] <wjp> that instance I linked to earlier is running on my VM\n'
p8453
aS'[22:50] <Henke37> does scummvm do any code generation?\n'
p8454
aS'[22:50] <wjp> no\n'
p8455
aS'[22:50] <snover> there is also the possibility of github oauth authentication through trac-github, which might be more useful if the plan is to remain hosting the repository on github\n'
p8456
aS'[22:50] <wjp> Henke37: that would be a portability nightmare\n'
p8457
aS'[22:50] <t0by> Henke37, what do you mean exactly?\n'
p8458
aS'[22:51] <wjp> snover: true. It might be more convenient for devs, but less convenient for other users\n'
p8459
aS'[22:51] <Henke37> exactly what wjp understood me asking\n'
p8460
aS"[22:51] <wjp> snover: but it's definitely worth considering\n"
p8461
aS"[22:52] <t0by> Henke37, I'd love to understand as well - as a last resort I can always crack open wjp's skull and insert probes in his brain, but last time I did that he made such a fuss  :*)\n"
p8462
aS'[22:53] <Henke37> t0by, code generation here means that the application generates code while it is executing and then runs the generated code\n'
p8463
aS'[22:53] <snover> if you set up the antispam stuff really thoroughly, anonymous bug reporting is also a decent option for users that dont have accounts\n'
p8464
aS'[22:53] <t0by> Henke37, yes, I got that part. I wondered where and for what purposes you were thinking of doing code generation.\n'
p8465
aS'[22:53] <t0by> *I was wondering?\n'
p8466
aS'[22:53] <t0by> engrish iz dificult\n'
p8467
aS'[22:54] <wjp> snover: mhm, but pushing that burden elsewhere sounds rather nice\n'
p8468
aS'[22:54] <Henke37> code generation is generally code for one of two purposes: runtime unpacking/decryption and MAXIMUM EMULATION SPEED\n'
p8469
aS'[22:55] <Henke37> s/code/done\n'
p8470
aS"[22:55] <wjp> snover: come to think of it, we currently also require users to register SF accounts, so requiring github accounts isn't a particularly big change\n"
p8471
aS'[22:56] <wjp> maybe I should just give that a try\n'
p8472
aS"[22:57] <t0by> Henke37, I suppose your were thinking of unpacking then? I mean, I'm just curious because I suppose you have an idea in mind :)\n"
p8473
aS'[22:57] <RichieSams> Henke37: Well all of the ScummVM engines are native\n'
p8474
aS'[22:57] <RichieSams> not emulated\n'
p8475
aS'[22:57] <snover> its probably the easiest, and you probably want the rest of the integration too so tickets can be automatically cross-referenced from cmomits\n'
p8476
aS'[22:57] <t0by> ^this of course.\n'
p8477
aS'[22:57] <RichieSams> so they should be running at max speed\n'
p8478
aS'[22:57] <t0by> ^this, no.\n'
p8479
aS'[22:58] <t0by> :P\n'
p8480
aS'[22:58] <Henke37> RichieSams, it is a matter of interpreter vs recompiler\n'
p8481
aS'[22:58] <Henke37> scummvm uses interpreters only afik\n'
p8482
aS"[22:58] <wjp> snover: hm, yes, that's an added bonus\n"
p8483
aS'[22:58] <RichieSams> yes, and no\n'
p8484
aS'[22:58] <RichieSams> they only interpret the game data\n'
p8485
aS'[22:58] <RichieSams> they are not interpretting code\n'
p8486
aS'[22:58] <wjp> (where data includes game scripts)\n'
p8487
aS'[22:58] <snover> of course these days i gently recommend maybe using gitlab instead of github, but thats just because i am sick of github spending all their developer resources on Atom instead of improving their core product :)\n'
p8488
aS'[22:58] <RichieSams> ok wjp, true\n'
p8489
aS'[22:59] <t0by> RichieSams, "game data" often includes logic :)\n'
p8490
aS'[22:59] <RichieSams> true true, I rest my case\n'
p8491
aS'[22:59] <t0by> Actually I believe more than one engine has a little bytecode VM.\n'
p8492
aS'[22:59] <Henke37> t0by, I was thinking of app store complications\n'
p8493
aS'[22:59] <t0by> *cough* WME *cough*\n'
p8494
aS'[23:00] <Henke37> the scumm engine series has bytecode vms\n'
p8495
aS'[23:00] <t0by> That as well.\n'
p8496
aS'[23:00] <RichieSams> lol, Sword2.5 runs a whole LUA instance\n'
p8497
aS'[23:01] <RichieSams> I wonder though, if the logic is the bottleneck in any of the engines\n'
p8498
aS'[23:01] <RichieSams> as in, would jit compiling even be worth anything\n'
p8499
aS'[23:01] <t0by> (rarely)\n'
p8500
aS'[23:01] <RichieSams> My assumption would be that blitting is the slowest thing\n'
p8501
aS'[23:01] <wjp> snover: hm :-)\n'
p8502
aS'[23:02] <RichieSams> yes?\n'
p8503
aS'[23:02] <LordHoto> graphics is the bottlenack usually :-P\n'
p8504
aS"[23:02] <t0by> don't say the b-word\n"
p8505
aS'[23:02] <snover> wjp: yeah, hm indeed :)\n'
p8506
aS'[23:02] <RichieSams> lolz\n'
p8507
aS'[23:03] <wjp> snover: is there similar trac/gitlab oauth/commit<->ticket integration in case we do ever want to move?\n'
p8508
aS"[23:04] <wjp> although I doubt we'd be moving anytime soon\n"
p8509
aS'[23:04] <Henke37> anyway, my point is that appstores have special rules about code generation\n'
p8510
aS'[23:04] <snover> wjp: that is a great question. i would have to do some research to see if anything is already out there, but gitlab has webhooks and an oauth provider so they have all the same ways to get data to trac as github\n'
p8511
aS'[23:04] <Henke37> and by "special rules", I mean "complete bans" for some platforms\n'
p8512
aS'[23:04] <snover> so worst case it would just mean writing a trac plugin\n'
p8513
aS"[23:05] <wjp> snover: ok, so at least theoretically it's not a dead-end if we ever want to move away from github\n"
p8514
aS'[23:05] <wjp> good enough for now I think\n'
p8515
aS'[23:05] <snover> !\n'
p8516
aS'[23:05] <wjp> so this does seem worth a serious try\n'
p8517
aS'[23:05] <Henke37> agreed, legobrick exclamation mark!\n'
p8518
aS'[23:07] <snover> Henke37: i do not feel bad about transmitting utf-8 in 2016 :)\n'

aS'[23:15] <criezy> I guess _sev is doing most of the "website stuff"\n'
p8530

p8900
aS'[20:09] <LordHoto> snover: Sorry, wrong nickname :-P\n'
p8901
aS'[20:09] <LordHoto> somaen: What kind of texture-concept?\n'
p8902
aS'[20:10] <somaen> Well, the engine basically loads a bunch of "BaseSurface"-instances, and then performs draw()-operations on those, with parameters defining scaling, position, rotation etc.\n'
p8903
aS'[20:11] <somaen> The entire design smells of "used to be a texture draw", but is now a set of Graphics::Surface-instances that are blitted into a screen surface.\n'
p8904
aS'[20:11] <LordHoto> somaen: I meant, is it some sort of "make X inherit from Y"? Because concepts always reminds me of the C++11 concept proposal which never made it :-P\n'
p8905
aS'[20:11] <somaen> No no\n'
p8906
aS'[20:11] <snover> anyway, unfortunately, it seems that the trick lskovlun told me on how to start up in the debug room in the original interpreter doesnt work for GK1 so I need to do something else to learn what this type 12 animation is supposed to look like and hopefully use that to make better sense of this code.\n'
p8907
aS'[20:11] <snover> i suspect it is a swipe fade\n'
p8908
aS'[20:11] <somaen> just replacing the Graphics::Surface with a texture and stuff like that\n'
p8909
aS'[20:12] <m_kiewitz> snover: you could just patch a script\n'
p8910
aS"[20:12] <somaen> (Stuff which neatly maps to how I planned to do HW acceleration in ScummVM, although I'd have to do it behind an opaque class wrapper in ScummVM)\n"
p8911
aS'[20:12] <m_kiewitz> snover: you want to trigger a specific ShowStyle?\n'
p8912
aS'[20:12] <LordHoto> somaen: The thing is: I planned to introduce some accerleration API in the near future. So, like, if the OpenGL backend is used and some extensions are avaialble, one could do stuff like TransparentSurface in hardware (by drawing into textures etc.)\n'
p8913
aS'[20:12] <snover> m_kiewitz: yeah, but you are the expert at that :)\n'
p8914
aS'[20:13] <snover> m_kiewitz: i just need to load room 471. i guess what i really need to do is figure out how to make sci companion not crash so i can easily make patches\n'
p8915
aS'[20:13] <LordHoto> somaen: So, for SDL2 one could use their accerleration backend too of course.\n'

aS'[20:14] <m_kiewitz> thx\n'
p8922
aS'[20:15] <somaen> LordHoto: My original plan was to put together something that followed the HW-approach a bit closer than what we do now, i.e. "upload \'texture\', then refer to it in operations afterwards"\n'
p8923
aS'[20:15] <somaen> That maps well to both SDL2, and pure OpenGL(ES)\n'

aS'[20:15] <LordHoto> somaen: Something like that, yes. Just that you would have something like "AcceleratedSurface", where direct writing of pixel data would be discouraged.\n'
p8926
aS'[20:16] <somaen> Or simply impossible\n'
p8927
aS'[20:16] <LordHoto> well, you need some way to initially upload data, but yes\n'
p8928
aS'[20:16] <somaen> Make it immutable, so that you have to just create a new one.\n'
p8929
aS'[20:16] <LordHoto> yeah sure, would be somewhat like that\n'
p8930
aS'[20:17] <m_kiewitz> snover: dump script 375 via ScummVM to disc\n'
p8931
aS'[20:17] <somaen> I originally had an idea of making a software fallback for such an interface out of what is the renderer in WME (since the abstraction allows for the optimizations done in WME)\n'
p8932
aS'[20:17] <snover> dang, it crashes immediately in wine\n'
p8933
aS'[20:17] <LordHoto> somaen: The software fallback needs to be there somehow :-)\n'
p8934
aS"[20:18] <somaen> Well, that's where the WME-renderer comes in, given that I can get the pixel-format issues fixed\n"
p8935
aS'[20:18] <LordHoto> What new pixel format issues?\n'
p8936
aS'[20:18] <m_kiewitz> snover: search within that file for the following bytes: 38 11 02 78 38 72 01\n'

aS'[20:18] _marc` (~marc@mos6581.de) joined #scummvm.\n'
p8938
aS'[20:18] <LordHoto> somaen: Well, actualy I wanted to make TransparentSurface use a sane format first.\n'
p8939
aS'[20:18] <somaen> Makes sense\n'
p8940
aS'[20:18] <somaen> templates to the rescue :P \n'
p8941
aS'[20:18] <m_kiewitz> snover: use a daily build, not your current working code\n'
p8942
aS'[20:18] <LordHoto> somaen: But adapting Sword25 looks like a small nightmare.\n'
p8943
aS"[20:19] <LordHoto> Well, I'm just fine with fixing TransparentSurface's format.\n"
p8944
aS'[20:20] <snover> m_kiewitz: i found the address\n'
p8945
aS'[20:20] <snover> m_kiewitz: the crashing comment was about scicompanion\n'
p8946
aS"[20:20] <m_kiewitz> snover: if you find that sequence (I own 1.100), replace the 72 01 with d7 01 and that should do the trick. although i don't know which patch filenames are accepted by the sierra interpreter\n"
p8947
aS'[20:20] <LordHoto> somaen: To something like RGBA memory layout\n'
p8948
aS'[20:21] <m_kiewitz> that will make the "play" button in the main menu warp you to room 471\n'
p8949
aS'[20:22] <snover> m_kiewitz: it worked, thanks :)\n'
p8950
aS'[20:23] <snover> and for reference the patch filename for sierra interpreter is ###.SCR\n'

p8956
aS"[20:23] <m_kiewitz> maybe the original interpreter also needs the heap as well as the script, I don't know for sure\n"
p8957

aS"[23:38] <[md5]> but it's only the interface (same as all the other low/hires games)\n"
p9421
aS'[23:38] <snover> [md5]: it definitely has some hires assets, unfortunately since i have the messed up PQCOL version i dont know if the original CD release installer let you switch to lores or not\n'
p9422

p9423
aS'[23:39] <m_kiewitz> LordHoto: yeah, gk1 has it. i mentioned it\n'

aS'[23:40] <[md5]> yeah, we currently set hires mode based on the DOS/Windows setting IIRC\n'
p9431
aS'[23:40] <m_kiewitz> yes, the platform windows thing was/still is basically a hack\n'
p9432
aS'[23:40] <[md5]> yep\n'
p9433
aS'[23:40] <[md5]> we should use a game-specific option\n'

p9437
aS'[23:40] <snover> LordHoto: even more pertinently, i think, for anyone that knows, windows versions had to use a restricted 236 palette so some people might think the DOS versions are the better ones\n'
p9438
aS"[23:40] <[md5]> it's easier to use than the platform thing\n"

p9452

p9453
aS'[23:44] <snover> Im guessing based on the engine numbers\n'

aS'[23:44] <snover> since until SCI2.1mid the engine had the lo/hi mode switch\n'

p9539
aS'[01:03] <m_kiewitz> o_O\n'
p9540
aS'[01:03] <m_kiewitz> were you able to identify the commit?\n'
p9541
aS'[01:04] <snover> i didnt try to blame it, i just moved the detection to the constructor, there is no reason to run it more than once anyway\n'
p9542
aS'[01:04] <m_kiewitz> yes, but is that the case for pq4 only?\n'
p9543
aS'[01:04] <m_kiewitz> or does it run that slowly for gk1 too?\n'
p9544
aS'[01:05] <snover> it did not run slowly for gk1 since it ran conditionally only on 2.1+\n'
p9545
aS'[01:05] <snover> there is some separate hires detection for gk1\n'
p9546
aS'[01:05] <m_kiewitz> ah, so its now running all the time?\n'
p9547
aS'[01:05] <m_kiewitz> i doubt games besides gk1 use the hires views?! or does pq4 use the same hires views too?\n'

p9551
aS"[01:06] <m_kiewitz> now that's a nice one\n"
p9552
aS'[01:07] <snover> ill take over for wjp and say that all of this code is guesswork so it probably isnt doing the right thing :)\n'
p9553
aS'[01:08] <snover> i can give you more information on the hires resources momentarily.\n'
p9554
aS'[01:08] <m_kiewitz> yes, i know. i guessed a bit of it too\n'
p9555
aS'[01:08] <m_kiewitz> and i actually reversed the hires views and such for gabriel knight 1\n'
p9556
aS"[01:09] <m_kiewitz> i wonder how police quest 4 does it. pq4 doesn't seem to have a resource.alt\n"
p9557
aS'[01:09] <snover> so lets see. that main menu is view 23\n'
p9558
aS'[01:09] <snover> the hires main menu is view 2300\n'
p9559
aS'[01:10] <m_kiewitz> ah pictures are hires from 10200 upwards\n'
p9560
aS'[01:10] <snover> Just Multiply By 100 . Problem Solved :D\n'
p9561
aS'[01:10] <m_kiewitz> i wonder how the scripts detect it\n'
p9562
aS'[01:10] <m_kiewitz> maybe another kernel call\n'
p9563
aS'[01:10] <snover> all i know is i love this chopped up cactus view\n'
p9564
aS'[01:11] <snover> why is it here?! who knows!\n'
p9565
aS'[01:12] <snover> there is a kIsHiRes :)\n'
p9566
aS'[01:12] <snover> it checks to see if the resolution is >=640x400\n'
p9567
aS'[01:13] <snover> and in fact is already implemented\n'
p9568
aS'[01:14] <snover> but i suppose if the engine thinks it should run at 320 then that is what the game gets\n'
p9569
aS'[01:14] <m_kiewitz> yes\n'
p9570
aS'[01:14] <m_kiewitz> so i guess i just have to add pq4 to the list for hires mode\n'
p9571
aS'[01:14] <snover> yeah :)\n'
p9572
aS'[01:15] <m_kiewitz> is there some screen that is actually hires in dosbox?\n'
p9573
aS"[01:15] <m_kiewitz> i can't find the main menu as hires picture via sci viewer\n"
p9574
aS'[01:15] <snover> main menu hires is at 2300\n'
p9575
aS'[01:15] <snover> and 2301\n'
p9576
aS"[01:16] <m_kiewitz> weird, i can't find those resources in my copy\n"
p9577
aS'[01:16] <snover> is yours pq4cd?\n'
p9578
aS'[01:16] <m_kiewitz> mine is pq4 collection\n'
p9579
aS'[01:16] <m_kiewitz> pq collection\n'
p9580
aS'[01:17] <m_kiewitz> with pq1, pq2, pq3 and pq4\n'
p9581
aS'[01:17] <m_kiewitz> it is the pq4 cd version\n'
p9582
aS'[01:18] <snover> hm. mine too, version 1.100.000, RESOURCE.000 is 18841068 bytes md5 468f4d4b80cae7c88066a9937046dca7\n'
p9583
aS'[01:19] <snover> maybe sci viewer is just &not working\n'
p9584
aS'[01:19] <snover> i am using scicompanion, now that i got it to not crash\n'
p9585
aS"[01:20] <m_kiewitz> ah and pq4 floppy doesn't have hires content included\n"
p9586
aS'[01:25] <snover> the way that the hires detection in the game engine works is really bad, it just looks to see if the video driver in the configuration file is VESA.DRV and if there is, and there is no "hires" configuration option, it sets it to hires\n'
p9587
aS'[01:26] <snover> if it is*\n'
p9588
aS'[01:26] <snover> otherwise if the video driver is not VESA.DRV it sets it to lores, or if hires=0 it sets it to lores\n'
p9589
aS'[01:26] <snover> so the installer is the only way that controlled whether or not you could do hires\n'

aS'[01:34] <snover> i clicked, i dunno, somewhere. not in the place i just clicked right now though which causes GfxView::draw to crash\n'

p9611
aS'[01:34] <m_kiewitz> http://i.imgur.com/ZuvpMfi.jpg\n'
p9612
aS'[01:34] <snover> the hires detection is still failing so it is probably trying to draw resources the werong way\n'
p9613
aS'[01:35] <m_kiewitz> in lowres the menu shows up\n'
p9614
aS'[01:35] <snover> yeah that looks like the first time\n'
p9615
aS'[01:35] <snover> i am going to force hires detection in frameout and see what happens\n'
p9616
aS'[01:35] <snover> but just for note it is crashing 0 view.cpp:852 1 frameout.cpp:956\n'
p9617
aS'[01:36] <snover> forcing hires doesnt fix anything, it still crashes on draw, it seems it is trying to draw off the screen\n'
p9618
aS'[01:37] <snover> and probably is reading off the end of bitmap\n'
p9619
aS'[01:37] <snover> celWidth = 29665 seems quite wrong\n'
p9620
aS'[01:39] <m_kiewitz> ah i see, the detection fails because there are actual low res pictures that get detected\n'
p9621
aS'[01:40] <m_kiewitz> will have to look at that tomorrow\n'
p9622
aS'[01:41] <m_kiewitz> resource 520 is screwing the detection up :(\n'
p9623
aS'[01:51] <m_kiewitz> ah wait, isHires() is meant to detect scripts actually using hires mode\n'
p9624
aS"[01:52] <m_kiewitz> so it's meant to fail for pq4, because the scripts are running at lowres\n"
p9625
aS"[01:54] <m_kiewitz> still i wonder why it's called in the screen class without a SCI version check\n"
p9626
aS'[01:54] <m_kiewitz> it basically makese no sense to call it for anything below sci2\n'
p9627
aS'[01:54] <snover> because the sci32 code is all guesswork? :D\n'
p9628
aS"[01:55] <m_kiewitz> ah wait, it's check sci version nvm\n"
p9629
aS'[01:55] <m_kiewitz> yes\n'
p9630
aS"[01:56] <m_kiewitz> so that explains why setting it for pq4 doesn't change anything, pq4 is not meant to get detected that way\n"
p9631
aS'[01:56] <m_kiewitz> maybe the method should be called something differently\n'
p9632
aS"[01:56] <m_kiewitz> gk1 is also detected as not hires, which is true because it's about scripts running at higher resolution, not really about just having some sort of hires content\n"
p9633
aS'[01:57] <m_kiewitz> and gk1 runs at 320x200 internally\n'
p9634
aS'[01:57] <snover> i think something bad might be happening\n'
p9635
aS'[01:57] <m_kiewitz> ?\n'
p9636
aS'[01:57] <snover> i know that is the worst way to put it right\n'
p9637
aS'[01:58] <snover> it may just be lldb being garbage again\n'
p9638
aS'[01:58] <snover> it looks like memory is being overwritten though\n'
p9639
aS'[01:59] <m_kiewitz> you got valgrind?\n'
p9640
aS'[01:59] <snover> not on hand, though there are some memory safety options i can turn on here\n'
p9641
aS'[02:00] <snover> and i am sure there is an instrumenter profile for this, hold on\n'
p9642
aS'[02:00] Nick change: Littleboy_ -> Littleboy\n'
p9643
aS'[02:01] <snover> hmph. i would hope this memory protection stuff would actually trigger a fault, but as of right now it is just preventing the crash\n'
p9644
aS'[02:02] <snover> and also fixing the garbage palette which definitely indicates memory is being overwritten\n'
p9645
aS'[02:09] <snover> blindly clicking on things, i found the clang static analyser, which finds some totally unrelated issues. videoDecoder leaks if scummvm fails to switch to RGB colour mode on line 207\n'

aS'[09:58] <snover> it looked to me like a double buffering system\n'

aS'[09:58] <snover> there is an update function that copies stuff from screen to visibleScreen\n'

p9742
aS'[09:59] <wjp> from what I can tell, CalcLists populates a DrawList (of "DrawItem"s) and an EraseList (of rects)\n'
p9743
aS'[10:00] <wjp> and does lots of rectangle processing to walk through these lists numerous times\n'
p9744
aS'[10:00] <wjp> probably no real magic in there, except for some interesting things depending on certain plane/screenitem properties\n'
p9745
aS'[10:01] <snover> so there is GraphicsMgr::UpdateScreen which copies the width and height of screen to visibleScreen in SQ6, what I *believe* is the same function in GK1 does more work than that\n'
p9746

p9864
aS'[18:43] <wysiwtf> okay\n'
p9865

p9874
aS'[18:54] <m_kiewitz> separate font?\n'
p9875
aS'[18:54] <snover> different\n'
p9876
aS"[18:54] <m_kiewitz> it's the font used by agi on amiga\n"
p9877
aS'[18:55] <snover> the sans-serif one?\n'
p9878
aS'[18:55] <m_kiewitz> they also used a different one on apple ii gs, but at least that one was a sierra font, which i can load from the file\n'
p9879
aS'[18:55] <m_kiewitz> the standard amiga topaz font was used\n'
p9880
aS'[18:55] <snover> i guess i am just confused, and trying to understand better\n'
p9881
aS'[18:55] <m_kiewitz> amiga topaz font came with the operating system\n'
p9882
aS'[18:55] <snover> like i get the font part but i dont get why load a font that does not look like the original font\n'
p9883
aS"[18:56] <m_kiewitz> it' the other way. we can't really dump the original topaz font, because it's copyrighted\n"
p9884
aS'[18:56] <m_kiewitz> and this replacement "topaz" font was "redrawn" by someone, but it looks nothing like the original topaz font\n'
p9885
aS'[18:56] <m_kiewitz> but we can distribute this replacement "topaz" (it\'s used at least by the engine parallaction)\n'
p9886
aS'[18:57] <m_kiewitz> and amiga topaz came with the OS, as i said and not with the game\n'
p9887
aS"[18:57] <m_kiewitz> i don't even know where it's stored\n"
p9888
aS'[18:57] <m_kiewitz> maybe even inside a ROM\n'

p9937
aS'[19:45] <snover> Having objects at +0 is always tripping me up\n'
p9938
aS"[19:45] <wjp> but it's probably wrong\n"
p9939
aS'[19:46] <snover> it could be a screen method, or it could be planelist method since planelist is at screen+0\n'
p9940
aS"[19:46] <wjp> gk1's sub_56E90 is the actual Screen::AddPic match with sq6\n"
p9941
aS'[19:47] <snover> I wont fully discount that this is could be a overload of AddPic, though it seems possibly odd since it is called from a function that is destroying (resetting) a showstyle\n'
p9942
aS"[19:47] <wjp> (given the nearby location I'd still assume 570CC is a Screen function, but that's not so important)\n"
p9943
aS'[19:47] <wjp> so interestingly, \n'
p9944
aS'[19:48] <snover> oh. wait. of course it is a screen function, the assert tells me so :)\n'
p9945
aS'[19:48] <wjp> a few functions after Screen::AddPic in SQ6, there _is_ a function called Screen::AddScreenItem\n'
p9946

p9947
aS'[19:48] <wjp> calling down into Plane::AddScreenItem\n'
p9948
aS'[19:48] <wjp> so if you have another reason to assume this one is taking a ScreenItem in gk1...\n'
p9949
aS'[19:49] <snover> the identical, non-aligned offsets are a pretty strong indicator\n'

p10122
aS"[23:20] <snover> the 1'000'000 counter is really weird because there is code that does `cmp [cbx+ScreenItem.thisWeirdValue], 1000000; jl` and if it does not jump then it calls MsgMgr::Fatal\n"
p10123
aS'[23:21] <snover> i guess maybe the value on the ScreenItem itself ends up getting decremented so this does not happen\n'

p10492
aS'[15:35] <snover> interesting to see other good information come out of shivers 2, i always thought it would have been a decent candidate for information extraction since the engine dll is separated from the rest of the game code and so all the engine functions are exported\n'

aS'[15:43] <wjp> yes, things are starting to make sense\n'

aS'[15:44] <[md5]> it was pseudo-3D, and you could look around (like Google Street View)\n'
p10506
aS'[15:44] <[md5]> so it used scrolling a lot\n'
p10507
aS'[15:44] <snover> [md5]: yes, it was superior in every way, except for that part where they made it impossible to implement without rewriting all the game logic :)\n'

p10531
aS'[15:56] <snover> I mean there are fingerprints of it all over the damn game but given the kernel mediator object in SCI3 I would imagine they actually wrote native C++\n'
p10532
aS'[15:56] <m_kiewitz> well no idea to be honest, maybe they actually wrote C++ code directly\n'
p10533
aS'[15:57] <m_kiewitz> that would be pretty bad for converting the DLLs\n'

aS'[17:12] <wjp> that one is not actually so complex\n'
p10599
aS'[17:12] <wjp> the actual drawing happens in virtual methods of CelObj\n'
p10600
aS'[17:12] <snover> if i can use the scrappy lists calculation for now then it is fine and i can handle DrawScreenItemsList too\n'
p10601
aS'[17:12] <snover> i guess, saying these words, im not sure too where you were planning on stopping :)\n'
p10602
aS"[17:13] <wjp> there's no plan :-)\n"
p10603
aS'[17:13] <snover> also i hope you have a nice trip :)\n'
p10604
aS'[17:13] <wjp> thanks\n'
p10605
aS'[17:14] <wjp> my semi-plan was to continue looking at this list processing until it makes sense, and then see if it already makes sense to hook it up in our engine\n'
p10606
aS'[17:15] <snover> ok. i guess maybe i will just try seeing how closely i can make this code work with whats already there. im still pretty unfamiliar with most of the drawing code that is already in scummvm engine\n'
p10607
aS"[17:16] <wjp> I've been avoiding looking at it too closely too\n"
p10608
aS'[17:18] <wjp> there\'s actually not all that much "magic" happening in CalcLists and friends\n'
p10609
aS'[17:18] <wjp> (relative to the amount of code in there, that is)\n'
p10610
aS'[17:19] <wjp> the vast majority seems to be rendering optimization rather than actual necessary processing\n'
p10611
aS'[17:19] <wjp> I wonder if it would be easy to shortcircuit things into just "redraw everything every frame" for testing purposes\n'
p10612
aS'[17:20] <snover> mm\n'
p10613
aS'[17:21] <snover> i guess the good news is that it looks like frameout probably has enough of what i need to make this work\n'
p10614
aS'[17:21] <wjp> nice\n'
p10615
aS'[17:22] <snover> _screenItems holds the screen items so worst case I just dump things in there\n'
p10616
aS'[17:22] <snover> it doesnt have the back buffer which might be a problem for transitions 11 and 12\n'
p10617
aS'[17:22] <snover> but ill see if just getting pixel data from sdl is good enough for now\n'
p10618
aS'[17:23] <wjp> hm, we keep a backbuffer ourselves as well I think?\n'
p10619
aS'[17:23] <wjp> oh, ugh, this reminds me that I had a fairly big patch to that buffer management that I completely forgot about\n'
p10620
aS'[17:24] <snover> ah, youre right, GfxScreen has lots of stuff in it\n'
p10621
aS"[17:25] <wjp> ( https://github.com/scummvm/scummvm/compare/master...wjp:sci_rgb ; it adds support for rendering in RGB mode instead of in palette mode, so transitions don't suffer from palette change effects)\n"
p10622
aS'[17:26] <snover> by palette change effects do you mean the flash of bad rendering caused by the palette changing before new screen pixels are drawn, or something else?\n'
p10623
aS'[17:26] <wjp> yes, exactly that\n'
p10624
aS'[17:26] <snover> well the good news is that thats hidden by some of the transitions ;)\n'
p10625
aS'[17:26] <LordHoto> snover: using OSystem::lockScreen to retrieve buffer contents is crazy :-P (just btw.)\n'
p10626
aS'[17:27] <snover> LordHoto: like crazy bad? :)\n'
p10627
aS'[17:27] <LordHoto> snover: Yes.\n'
p10628
aS'[17:27] <snover> luckily gfxscreen has what i need.\n'
p10629
aS'[17:28] <m_kiewitz> snover/wjp: original sci did exactly do that as well, because 256 color vga\n'
p10630
aS'[17:28] <m_kiewitz> you see it when you turn down cycles in dosbox\n'
p10631
aS'[17:28] <wjp> sure\n'
p10632
aS"[17:28] <wjp> doesn't mean it's pretty :-)\n"
p10633
aS"[17:29] <m_kiewitz> well if it was pretty, it wouldn't be accurate anymore :P\n"
p10634
aS'[17:29] <snover> yeah, palette UpdateHardware runs first and then ShowBits runs right after that so if the screen updates between those two then it happens\n'
p10635
aS"[17:29] <wjp> this is one type of accuracy that I don't care about at all\n"
p10636
aS'[17:29] <snover> i dont know why not just not update the system screen until after both operations are completed though, isnt sdl atomic there?\n'
p10637
aS'[17:29] <m_kiewitz> im sure some hardcore fan will complain :P\n'
p10638
aS'[17:30] <wjp> snover: some transitions show partial contents of both old and new pic simultaneously\n'
p10639
aS"[17:30] <wjp> and they don't share a palette\n"
p10640
aS'[17:30] <snover> i think those are the type 11 and 12, that copy out of the visible screen buffer\n'
p10641
aS'[17:31] <snover> but this patch affects all versions of sci huh\n'
p10642
aS"[17:31] <wjp> I didn't think about SCI32 when writing it at all\n"
p10643
aS'[17:32] <wjp> the other thing that that sci_rgb branch does, is bring back a FreeSCI feature that allowed changing the EGA palette per-view and per-pic, so it can for example give Ego in old ega games a nicer colour\n'

p10662
aS'[17:47] <LordHoto> m_kiewitz: Or amber and black :-P\n'
p10663
aS'[17:48] <snover> i mean not using non-smeary composite signal\n'
p10664
aS'[17:48] <snover> er\n'
p10665
aS'[17:48] <snover> wow too many double negatives\n'
p10666
aS'[17:49] <snover> never used a composite monitor, so no smearing that would make the dithered colour look more like a flat shade\n'
p10667
aS"[17:49] <LordHoto> It's also looking fine on non-composite monitors.\n"
p10668
aS'[17:51] <t0by> "wrong but not necessarily in a bad way"... I think Lucas would suggest "Special Edition"\n'
p10669
aS'[17:51] <wjp> m_kiewitz: I forget, but do we do gamma-correcting averaging for those undithered colours?\n'
p10670
aS'[17:52] <m_kiewitz> snover: it wasn\'t meant to be smeared, but the dithered graphics look really pixelated. when you look at the dithered graphics from a distance, the pixels effectively "merge" and the color that you see then is the color that we use directly\n'
p10671
aS'[17:52] <m_kiewitz> wjp: i think we do. that was one of the issues back then, but was changed 2010 or so\n'
p10672
aS'[17:53] <LordHoto> I guess it rather depends on the size of your monitor.\n'
p10673
aS'[17:53] <wjp> I probably ask the same question every time it comes up :-)\n'
p10674
aS'[17:53] <t0by> wjp, that is pretty awesome-looking. but is that done on "regular" bitmaps? there is no meta information on any sort?\n'
p10675
aS"[17:53] <m_kiewitz> it's distance + monitor size of course\n"
p10676
aS'[17:54] <m_kiewitz> but the whole point of dithering is to effectively simulator more colors\n'
p10677
aS'[17:54] <LordHoto> I tried MI2 CGA on a 14" a digital RGB (CGA/EGA) CRT. It didn\'t really look that pixelated form a normal viewing distance.\n'

p10681
aS"[17:54] <m_kiewitz> t0by: we don't really undither. we simply don't do a dithering pass\n"
p10682
aS'[17:54] <m_kiewitz> the sierra backgrounds actually contained almost 256 colors internally\n'
p10683
aS'[17:54] <t0by> oh.\n'
p10684
aS'[17:55] <t0by> i thought there was some black magic going on inside.\n'
p10685
aS'[17:56] <snover> m_kiewitz: i guess i am just not explaining myself very well today& when i played this game originally it was on a 22" aperture grill CRT and the dithering was always apparent, so even though using a high-colour mode and not dithering, subjectively it looks wrong as compared to how i remember it supposed to look\n'
p10686
aS'[17:56] <m_kiewitz> sierra was pretty smart to do that instead of only delivering the dithered graphics directly. sadly they never got the idea to create a VGA driver for their old games to actually use it\n'
p10687
aS'[17:56] <snover> not dithering is more accurate to what it was possibly supposed to look like*\n'
p10688
aS'[17:56] <LordHoto> snover: 22" CRT?!? :-P\n'
p10689
aS"[17:57] <m_kiewitz> that's how it looked on almost all monitors\n"

p11291
aS'[07:03] <Harekiet> what you working on snover?\n'
p11292
aS'[07:03] <snover> Harekiet: sci32 graphics engine, specifically screen transitions at the moment\n'
p11293
aS'[07:04] <Harekiet> sci32 support for the last few sci games, nice :)\n'
p11294
aS'[07:05] <Harekiet> although just played the gabriel knight remake a while back already, the most important one \n'
p11295
aS'[07:05] <snover> yeah ! :)\n'
p11296
aS'[07:06] <Harekiet> of the few sierra games I own, sci32 actually seems to be the most\n'
p11297
aS'[07:06] <snover> the pixels were smaller in sci32, more fun to find them :D\n'
p11298
aS'[07:07] <Harekiet> yeh gk1 seems a bit strange with that, thought that was jsut running in 320x200\n'
p11299
aS'[07:07] <snover> yeah the early sci32 games are weirdo\n'
p11300
aS'[07:08] <snover> like they did most of the art assets at 320x200 and then were like HEY! 640x480 is a thing! and dropped a few token hi-res graphics in\n'
p11301
aS'[07:08] <Harekiet> oh larry 6 highre is sci32 as well, just replayed that a while back as well, but that ran fine in dos emu :)\n'
p11302
aS'[07:09] <Harekiet> yeh dunno what the kq6 with highres portraits runs at then\n'
p11303
aS'[07:09] <snover> Harekiet: it will never run fine, how dare you ! :) the transition speed is cpu speed dependent due to some crack coding\n'
p11304
aS'[07:09] <Harekiet> snover haha must have been lucky, and  sq6 highres is the only sci32 game i replayed in ages\n'
p11305
aS"[07:10] <Harekiet> A replay of gk2 is still planned though so if you'd just get that working :P\n"
p11306
aS'[07:10] <snover> itll happen!!\n'
p11307
aS'[07:12] <snover> on the upside looks like someone there probably read Graphics Gems, the dissolve transition uses OEIS A246866\n'

aS'[19:24] <VonGuard> Macross was my first job assignment at Lucasfilm. They urgently wanted to replace the existing assembler they had been using. That one was written in Lisp  you wrote 6502 code in S-expressions, which looked amazingly weird. It was awesomely powerful, because you could use all of Lisp for a macro language, but it was also awesomely slow. It took about 45 minutes on our VAX 750 to assemble a 16K ROM cartridge game, mainly because do\n'
p11471
aS'[19:24] <VonGuard> ing this took 2 megabytes of RAM but the machine only had 512 kilobytes, so it page swapped horribly.

aS'[19:30] <snover> i am not 100% sure this is what it is\n'
p12315
aS'[19:30] <snover> if i read this properly it is scanning propDict for property 81h\n'
p12316
aS'[19:30] <wjp> it is\n'
p12317
aS"[19:31] <wjp> it's getting selector 0x81\n"
p12318
aS'[19:31] <snover> oh, which is magnifier, which exactly perfectly makes sense\n'
p12319
aS'[19:31] <snover> (except that i dont actually know what a magnifier actually is :D)\n'
p12320
aS'[19:31] <wjp> this is the same access pattern as the one from Plane::UpdateFromObj from recently\n'
p12321
aS"[19:32] <lskovlun> it's a property lookup pattern, yes\n"
p12322
aS'[19:34] <snover> can I use readSelectorValue for this in ScummVM or do I have to do something special?\n'
p12323
aS'[19:34] <wjp> that should be fine\n'
p12324
aS"[19:36] <wjp> you _may_ have to add it to Kernel::mapSelectors(), but I'm not sure of the specifics here\n"
p12325
aS'[19:37] <lskovlun> yes\n'
p12326
aS'[19:38] <lskovlun> and in the SelectorCache definition\n'
p12327
aS'[19:38] <lskovlun> gee, that constructor looks ugly\n'
p12328
aS'[19:38] <wjp> right\n'
p12329
aS'[19:38] <snover> lskovlun: which one?\n'
p12330
aS'[19:39] <lskovlun> SelectorCache::SelectorCache()\n'
p12331
aS'[19:39] <lskovlun> calls memset on itself?!?\n'
p12332
aS"[19:40] <wjp> it's a very basic struct fortunately\n"
p12333
aS'[19:40] <lskovlun> is it guaranteed to work on all platforms?\n'
p12334
aS"[19:40] <wjp> I can't think of a reason why it wouldn't\n"
p12335
aS'[19:41] <wjp> (Selector is just an int)\n'
p12336
aS'[19:41] <lskovlun> hidden fields added by the compiler? this is C++, remember\n'
p12337
aS'[19:41] <wjp> it should be a POD struct\n'
p12338
aS'[19:42] <wjp> (oh, or maybe except that it has a constructor? I forget the exact definition...)\n'
p12339
aS'[19:43] <wjp> hm\n'
p12340
aS'[19:43] <lskovlun> A Plain Old Data Structure in C++ is an aggregate class that contains only PODS as members, has no user-defined destructor, no user-defined copy assignment operator, and no nonstatic members of pointer-to-member type.\n'
p12341
aS"[19:44] <wjp> that's google inaccurate guess\n"
p12342
aS'[19:44] <lskovlun> yes\n'
p12343
aS"[19:48] <wjp> so we're in the somewhat paradoxical situation that adding the constructor with a memset breaks the guarantee that it can be set with memset\n"
p12344
aS'[19:48] <lskovlun> yeah\n'
p12345
aS'[19:49] <lskovlun> seems that way\n'
p12346
aS'[19:49] <wjp> in practice it should be fine, though\n'
p12347
aS"[19:52] <wjp> (although I certainly wouldn't mind if someone moves that memset to the Kernel constructor)\n"

p12351
aS'[20:02] <wjp> user-defined constructors are also out\n'
p12352
aS'[20:02] <LordHoto> Yeah, just looked it up, it needs to be an aggregate so constructors are ruled out\n'

aS'[16:26] <snover> well, memories are fuzzy i guess :)\n'
p12623

p12635
aS'[16:57] <snover> hey m_kiewitz, do you know what is in a pic resource at offset 4 (word size)? it is multiplied by a cel number, i dont see it in GfxPicture but I might be missing it\n'

aS'[16:58] <snover> yes\n'

p12642
aS"[17:00] <m_kiewitz> maybe it's the cel count actually\n"

aS'[17:04] <snover> its 0Eh in two random pics from GK1\n'

aS'[17:04] <m_kiewitz> ah, wait it really seems that one is unknown to us atm\n'
p12649
aS'[17:05] <snover> what is going on here& data+0 is 0x8181 which is way too big to be a header size\n'
p12650
aS'[17:05] <m_kiewitz> sure? in sci viewer it shows that the first 2 bytes are 0Eh, although im not sure if thats really the first bytes of the actual resource data\n'
p12651
aS'[17:05] <snover> i need to use something else to extract this, i think scicompanion might be doing something wrong\n'
p12652

p12653
aS'[17:06] <snover> alright thats fine\n'
p12654
aS'[17:07] <m_kiewitz> it seems that 0x0E 00 is really the header size\n'
p12655
aS"[17:07] <m_kiewitz> can't you use SCI viewer?\n"
p12656
aS'[17:07] <snover> actually it must be a global resource header that gets offset by resourcemgr \n'
p12657
aS'[17:07] <snover> sci viewer outputs the same thing\n'
p12658

aS'[17:41] <snover> hmm, how strange. there is a field_3C on CelObj that is set to the compressed flag from the file (according to what GfxPicture says about the cel) but is default initialised to 1000. unless i managed to comment on the wrong field somehow&\n'
p12691
aS'[17:42] <snover> m_kiewitz: i might know why the pics were messed up when you turned on hires in PQ4, theres an unknown dword field mentioned in the comments in GfxPicture for a cel header (its actually two word fields) that is used to define default width/heights for pictures\n'
p12692
aS'[17:44] <m_kiewitz> displaceX/Y are basically offsets\n'
p12693
aS"[17:44] <m_kiewitz> so that the cel is drawn not at 0,0, but let's say based on coordinate 5,5\n"
p12694
aS'[17:44] <snover> if the second field is non-zero then the literal values are used for width and height, otherwise if the second field is zero the first field is a flag 0=320x200 1=640x480 2=640x400\n'

p13152
aS'[01:42] <snover> sierra moved screen transition code between SCI2.1early and SCI2.1mid, such that at first glance only two of the original transition types still existed. but actually, it turns out that they just moved most of the transitions to behind PalMorphFrameOut\n'

p13154

p13157
aS'[01:45] <snover> so the only way any of the last week of work I did becomes valuable is if it turns out that the SQ6 changes arent just optimisations but are in fact incompatible to the earlier engine\n'

p13159
aS'[01:46] <snover> SCI3 is much closer to SCI2.1mid in this area too, I dont think they really changed the transition code, just added one extra transition\n'

p13219
aS'[07:40] <snover> ok, i guess its actually that i just dont understand how this is working \n'
p13220
aS'[07:42] <snover> in a loop for each division, plus one extra for any remainder space, it creates a rect, clears rectList, puts the rect on rectList, and calls showBits\n'
p13221
aS'[07:43] <snover> then once its all done it creates a rect that covers the entire plane and does it with that rect\n'
p13222
aS'[07:45] <snover> oh. jesus. i think i see what is going on here. this code must have been generated from a generalised function\n'
p13223
aS'[07:46] <snover> instead of just drawing one rect from the top of the plane to the bottom of the plane for a HShutterOut, it draws every horizontal division line separately\n'
p13224
aS'[07:46] <snover> in a loop\n'
p13225
aS'[07:47] <snover> i feel like i made this algorithm much more intelligently generic when i wrote it from GK1, though i guess they really wanted the iris in/out to use the same main code\n'
p13226
aS'[07:48] <snover> i ended up making iris separate because it ended up being harder to understand the code with trying to use a single function for 1, 2, or 4-way wipe transitions\n'

p13802
aS'[17:54] <snover> interesting since things like palmorphframeout and processeffects are copying things directly from `screen` lists to `currBuffer`\n'

p13808
aS'[17:57] <wjp> yeah\n'

p13811
aS'[17:59] <snover> thanks for the update, i have it represented in my idb now\n'
p13812
aS'[18:00] <wjp> but basically what Plane::CalcLists is doing is looking at differences between visibleScreen and screen, and adding the things in visibleScreen to the erase rect, and things in screen to the draw list\n'
p13813
aS'[18:01] <snover> that makes sense. what do you think is the best way of representing this second set of things in the scummvm engine, since these screen representations are rather different than GfxScreen?\n'
p13814

p13815
aS'[18:01] <snover> we could just hold two sets of lists on GfxFrameout I suppose for now\n'
p13816
aS"[18:02] <wjp> I don't think it's really related to GfxScreen\n"
p13817
aS'[18:02] <wjp> yeah, keeping it in GfxFrameout seems fine\n'
p13818
aS'[18:05] <snover> in GK1 both screens have an associated pixel buffer plus a memorymgr handle\n'
p13819
aS'[18:05] <snover> though those piece of information are stored on GraphicsMgr\n'
p13820
aS'[18:05] <snover> i guess i should look more deeply at graphicsmgr constructor here in SQ6 to see if the same is true\n'
p13821
aS"[18:05] <wjp> I haven't seen any reason yet why visibleScreen would have a pixel buffer\n"
p13822
aS"[18:06] <wjp> (but I also doubt I've already looked everywhere where it could be used)\n"
p13823
aS'[18:08] <snover> in GK1 GraphicsMgr creates screen+buffer for screen and GraphicsMgrDOS creates visibleScreen+buffer for visibleScreen\n'
p13824
aS'[18:09] <snover> i dont see the same code in SQ6\n'
p13825

aS'[18:10] <lskovlun> low-res stuff, perhaps?\n'

aS'[18:11] <snover> itll take me a second to figure this out, its doing arithmetic on eax\n'
p13832
aS'[18:15] <snover> ok so the second one is priMap\n'
p13833
aS'[18:15] <lskovlun> it does keep one? interesting\n'
p13834
aS'[18:16] <snover> oh and there is yet a third buffer here in fact\n'

aS'[18:18] <snover> yeah, they both are initialised to the same width/height\n'
p13840
aS"[18:19] <lskovlun> the reason it's odd is that some SCI games have large priorities (hundreds or thousands)\n"
p13841
aS"[18:19] <lskovlun> so they won't fit in an 8-bit buffer\n"
p13842
aS'[18:19] <snover> oh, sorry, i should have been clearer\n'
p13843
aS'[18:21] <snover> in gk1 the two buffers are given the same width and height dimensions\n'
p13844
aS'[18:21] <snover> thats not to say that the underlying buffer data is also the same size, that memory is allocated separately\n'

aS'[18:28] <lskovlun> My IDA places the reference to it in a "processThrow" routine, complete with a type and all\n'
p13851
aS'[18:29] <snover> yeah i found some GOOF macro in open watcom\n'

aS'[18:30] <snover> [&]\n'
p13855
aS'[18:31] <snover> so now as far as the priMap size goes\n'
p13856
aS'[18:31] <snover> let me look\n'
p13857
aS"[18:34] <lskovlun> if there is indeed a priMap, maybe it's only for the pic\n"
p13858
aS'[18:35] <lskovlun> I noticed with my hacked interp that I could walk on tables and stuff\n'
p13859
aS'[18:36] <lskovlun> (and the scripted priorities would then only be stored in ScreenItems and Planes)\n'
p13860
aS'[18:39] <snover> lskovlun: its 8bpp in SQ6 too\n'
p13861
aS'[18:39] <snover> screenWidth*screenHeight is the memory allocated size\n'
p13862
aS'[18:39] <snover> for both visiblescreen and primap\n'
p13863
aS'[18:40] <snover> so ok, i guess there is one visible screen buffer and one priority buffer and that is what i was seeing, not a second buffer\n'
p13864
aS'[18:41] <lskovlun> only for the pic then, I guess\n'
p13865
aS'[18:41] <lskovlun> I see scripted priorities in SQ6 up to 650\n'
p13866
aS'[18:42] <lskovlun> but it would make sense to have CalcLists and friends deal with those\n'
p13867
aS'[18:42] <lskovlun> directly from the ScreenItems/Planes\n'
p13868
aS'[18:47] <snover> wjp: Seems like GraphicsMgrDOS::field_1E9C is some DPMI structure? +0 is width, +4 is height, & i dont see +8 being set but it follows it would indicate colour depth. field_1E98 is isHiRes flag\n'
p13869
aS'[18:48] <snover> though in sq6 were always hires\n'
p13870
aS'[18:48] <snover> (by which i mean, the passed value is *always* 1)\n'
p13871
aS'[18:49] <snover> so this is some holdover from SCI2\n'
