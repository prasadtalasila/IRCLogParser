aS"[00:01] <daftykins> it's almost like it's NEW YEARS\n"
p31
aS'[00:01] <Borillion> LOL\n'
p32
aS'[00:01] <William9455> LOL yes it is Happy New Year\n'
p33
aS'[00:02] <William9455> Sadly though still having issus with linux and software updater\n'
p34
aS'[00:02] <William9455> Maybe my computer should start drinking then it can be a great new year\n'
p35
aS'[00:02] <KxTwo> Not everyone celebrates or cares about NEW YEARS lol\n'
p36
aS'[00:03] <William9455> See it is a new year, but nothing new ever happens same old stuff every year\n'
p37
aS'[00:03] <KxTwo>  New years is just a western thing.  People use it as another excuse to get drunk and be stupid aka basically act like they do every other day\n'
p38
aS'=== LordOfTime is now known as TheLordOfTime\n'
p39
aS'[00:03] <William9455> LOL well I am from WI and they do not need excuses to drink\n'
p40
aS'[00:04] <William9455> and in easter calanders it is not a new year, yet.\n'
p41
aS'[00:04] <William9455> But they do celebrate their new year, like china has thirs and they get drunk there too\n'
p42
aS'[00:05] <daftykins> KxTwo: true, but in my eyes it stops randomers asking for things for just a day or two a year in channels like this ;)\n'
p43
aS'[00:06] <KxTwo> daftykins, if you dont want to be asked of anything simply log out?\n'
p44
aS"[00:06] <daftykins> lol don't be a nob\n"
p45
aS'[00:06] <KxTwo> I love some peoples logic lol\n'
p46
aS'[00:06] <KxTwo> a nob?  LMFAO\n'
p47
aS'[00:06] <William9455> Well maybe it does, this is a free support, if you want 24 365 supportthen that usually costs ya, shouldnt complain just say oh well life goes on, read up your problem on google usually helps me whn I can not get an answer here\n'
p48
aS'[00:06] <daftykins> no my logic is thinking of others :)\n'
p49
aS'[00:06] <daftykins> William9455: true that :)\n'
p50
aS'[00:07] <Gnea> William9455: this is a channel, not a room.\n'
p51
aS'[00:08] <William9455> This is a "free" os but that does not mean support is always there, sometimes have to bit the bit and read up on your topic yourself, I know google has a translate so you can see the help files in native laguange\n'
p52
aS"[00:08] <KxTwo> granted this is support but its also a discussion channel, I've come here plenty of times not really needing support but just trying to educate myself by asking questions.  Like currently trying to understand the different DE's and WM etc.  If some one doesn't want to discuss or answer questions they can simply not respond or log out.  Not really a complex idea.\n"
p53
aS'[00:08] <Gnea> okay, do any of you have anything on topic to ask or discuss?\n'

aS'[00:09] <William9455> And yes right now we are discussing the freedoms of people to celebrate their new year and no support 24 7 365\n'
p58
aS"[00:09] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  it's ubuntu-specific support chan, though\n"
p59
aS'[00:09] <Gnea> William9455: then do so in #ubuntu-offtopic please\n'
p60
aS'[00:09] <bazhang> KxTwo, its NOT the chat channel\n'
p61
aS'[00:09] <William9455> Sorry\n'
p62
aS'[00:09] <KxTwo> NewWorld, ive not asked anything not related to ubuntu.\n'
p63
aS'[00:09] <NewWorld> oh ok\n'
p64
aS'[00:10] <bazhang> KxTwo, this is support only. #ubuntu-discuss or #ubuntu-offtopic for chit chat\n'
p65
aS'[00:10] <KxTwo> NewWorld, my comment was in response to some one saying they liked new years because it meant people wouldnt ask questions.  I thought that was silly.\n'
p66
aS'[00:11] <NewWorld> maybe the mods are out celebrating, so we CAN chit chat hehe\n'
p67
aS'[00:11] <William9455> Not quite it was more about this is quiet and you said well just because it is new years it should not be quiet, then i went off on my tangent sorry of topic again\n'
p68
aS"[00:11] <daftykins> aka this guy can't take a joke ^_^\n"

aS'[00:11] <Gnea> !ubuntu\n'
p73
aS'[00:11] <ubottu> Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com\n'
p74
aS'[00:11] <KxTwo> Anyway my last question relating to ubuntu was involving unity.  I am a little confused I thought unity was a windows manager for gnome but obviously wrong.  When I do ech desktop environment it just says ubuntu.\n'
p75
aS'[00:12] <daftykins> bazhang: that was pretty sad\n'
p76
aS'[00:12] <bazhang> KxTwo, its a shell, just as gnome-shell is\n'
p77
aS'[00:12] <Gnea> KxTwo: Unity is a shell\n'
p78
aS'[00:12] <bazhang> daftykins, lets move on please\n'
p79
aS'[00:12] <Kilum> anyone here used a pinnacle dazzle on ubuntu\n'
p80
aS'[00:12] <KxTwo> so unity is a shell for gnome 3.0?\n'
p81
aS'[00:12] <bazhang> correct\n'
p82
aS'[00:13] <Gnea> !unity | KxTwo\n'
p83
aS'[00:13] <ubottu> KxTwo: Unity is the default UI since Ubuntu 11.04.  Unity is a shell for GNOME. see http://unity.ubuntu.com. For a GNOME 2-like experience, see !notunity\n'
p84
aS'[00:13] <Apteryx> Hello! Does someone tested connecting a USB mass storage Android phone to a LiveCD or LiveUSB?\n'
p85
aS'[00:14] <i3ear> I have a big question\n'
p86
aS'[00:14] <i3ear> anyone got the time?\n'
p87
aS'[00:14] <PDun> Apteryx - Mine gets recognized for booting from LiveUSB and recognized when loaded\n'
p88
aS"[00:14] <Apteryx> Or could make a quick test? I can't make it work. No USB connection is detected. I wonder if it's hardware related or just a general limitation?\n"
p89
aS'[00:15] <Gnea> !ask | i3ear\n'
p90
aS"[00:15] <ubottu> i3ear: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience\n"
p91
aS'[00:15] <NewWorld> Apteryx:  is it not listed in `lsusb`?\n'
p92
aS'[00:15] <Apteryx> PDun: oh. So it works? You can activate USB storage and copy files from phone to LiveUSB? Which version of Ubuntu are you using?\n'
p93
aS'[00:15] <KxTwo> what eversion of gnome am I running.  The gnome-about command does not seem to exist\n'
p94
aS'[00:15] <i3ear> I am a musician and I have just one program that I need in windows, but it is really important. Can I run virtual midi connections from linux through vm ware to windows and then back again for audio?\n'
p95
aS'[00:16] <Wulfe> are you sure the android "live usb drive" it is in host mode and not OTG mode.\n'
p96
aS'[00:16] <PDun> I am on 10.04 but also worked with 11.10\n'
p97
aS'[00:16] <Apteryx> NewWorld: PDun ok, thanks.\n'
p98
aS'[00:16] <nipar> I "started ubuntuing" just recently, and for that purpose I decided to hang out here\n'
p99
aS'[00:17] <nipar> and now all I can think is, why is linux/ubuntu good? :l\n'
p100
aS'[00:17] <nipar> There\n'
p101
aS'[00:17] <Apteryx> NewWorld: nothing seems to happen when I plug the phone by USB to LiveUSB. No USB connection menu appears in the Android notification area and lsusb does not list the phone :(\n'
p102
aS'[00:17] <nipar> are limitations in software and all kinds of weird things going on\n'
p103
aS'[00:18] <josefwu> i3ear you prolly can pull that off with wine\n'
p104
aS'[00:18] <NewWorld> Apteryx:  do `dmesg`. Unplug/replug it. do `dmesg` again, and see what it told you\n'
p105
aS'[00:18] <KxTwo> ugh so confusing\n'
p106
aS'[00:18] <Wulfe> Apteryx:  are you sure it is in host mode and not OTG mode.\n'
p107
aS'[00:18] <i3ear> josefwu: I am not sure how stable this program is on wine, it is a very uncommon program to run on linux\n'
p108
aS'[00:18] <i3ear> josefwu: that and I could never figure out how wine works :x\n'
p109
aS'[00:18] <Apteryx> Wulfe: hmm, how can I check this? By default I think it would be in host mode?\n'
p110
aS'[00:19] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  can you not find out the gnome version in your package manager?\n'
p111
aS'[00:19] <josefwu> i3ear what program is it?\n'
p112
aS'[00:20] <KxTwo> NewWorld, im not sure how, I simly did a google search and everything talks about the shell but not the version of gnome itself.  I thought I read somewhere that gnome 3.2 would be mroe up my alley but I dont knwo if it means the shell or the DE\n'
p113
aS'[00:20] <Apteryx> NewWorld: Just tried the dmesg, unplug-replug, dmesg and nothing new is printed there :|\n'
p114
aS'[00:20] <Wulfe> well iirc you want it in OTG mode which is usually default. but Host mode makes other things the "drive/peripheral"\n'
p115
aS'[00:20] <i3ear> josefwu: I could but I could never get it to work. but meh I have yet to install linux as lubuntu was giving me problems. I came here to ask for help about it but now I am thinking about just getting rid of windows xp\n'
p116
aS'[00:21] <KxTwo> !notunity\n'
p117
aS'[00:21] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic\n'
p118
aS"[00:21] <i3ear> josefwu: sorry I didn't see your message, it is abox2 https://sites.google.com/site/analogbox2/\n"
p119
aS'[00:21] <Wulfe> OTG mode or "on the go" mode is what makes it allowable to have it as a drive. that kind of information will be found th the devices manufacture information.\n'
p120
aS"[00:21] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  well open up synaptic and search for gnome and check it's version\n"
p121
aS"[00:21] <Apteryx> Wulfe: I'm pretty sure it's in the correct mode by default, because on a real, as in installed opposed to Live version of Ubuntu, it would get detected and mounted easily without doing anything special (other than activating USB memory access from the notification area in Android)\n"
p122
aS'[00:22] <KxTwo> NewWorld, I dont have synaptic\n'
p123
aS'[00:22] <Wulfe> okay then it is most definitely in OTG mode.\n'
p124
aS'[00:23] <Wulfe> Apteryx: is the BIOS detecting it as a USB HDD?\n'
p125
aS'[00:23] <Apteryx> hum, I can check\n'
p126
aS'[00:23] <Wulfe> you may have to set it up in the BIOS first on some machines\n'
p127
aS'[00:23] <Wulfe> before USB drives can be booted from\n'
p128
aS'[00:23] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  then with dpkg , check `man dpkg` on how to search for a pkg\n'
p129
aS"[00:24] <Apteryx> Wulfe: I'm not sure you got my scenario right, I'm booting Ubuntu from a USB key (distinct from phone) and trying to access my Nexus S internal memory from there\n"

p139
aS"[00:25] <Apteryx> No, it's should be a really simple scenario, it puzzles me as to why it's not working already ;)\n"
p140
aS'[00:26] <nmatrix9> Anyone know of any software to turn my linux box into a hub/router so my NAS and other devices can share my linux box internet connection which is wireless?\n'

p149
aS'[00:28] <nmatrix9> PDun, no\n'
p150
aS'[00:29] <PDun> Than that is likely your issue:-)\n'
p151
aS"[00:29] <Wulfe> Apteryx:  it should be listed in 'lsusb' and i would assume 'dmesg' would have reported something about it when it was plugged in. otherwise idk. have you tried asking about it in the Galaxy S threads on XDA?\n"
p152
aS'[00:29] <nmatrix9> PDun, Oh\n'

aS"[06:58] <Mechdave> MK`, Sorry, I don't know... It might come to searching through the xml files to find the right launcher in .gconf yet :(\n"

aS"[06:59] <average_drifter> jagginess: what's up ?\n"
p1042
aS"[06:59] <MK`> well whatever they're called. I made a left panel and added the window list to it and it crashed :P just need to find that and remove it, or just remove the third panel.\n"
p1043
aS'[06:59] <jagginess> bellundger, each host has a key-pair.. they only exchange the public keys..\n'
p1044
aS'[07:00] <bellundger> how would i implement it though?\n'
p1045
aS'[07:00] <average_drifter> MK`: what window manager are you using ?\n'
p1046
aS'[07:00] <jagginess> bellundger, when you send a message to someone else.. You encrypt your message using "their" public key..\n'
p1047
aS"[07:00] <average_drifter> MK`: remove your window manager, and install i3 instead , then you won't have anymore crashes\n"

aS"[07:00] <average_drifter> i3 ==> best and most stable window-manager I've seen in my life\n"
p1050
aS'[07:00] <jagginess> bellundger, you cannot "decrypt" your encrypted message using their public key.. because the algorithm is "asymmetric"\n'
p1051
aS'[07:01] <average_drifter> MK`: yeah, gnome is a piece of crap, remove it\n'
p1052
aS'[07:01] <jagginess> bellundger, which is a "good" thing\n'

p1067
aS'[07:04]  * jagginess has problems saying pgp without thinking gpg\n'
p1068
aS'[07:05] <dr_willis> MK`:  you could delete/rename the various config files untill you reset your gnome back to its defaults.\n'
p1069
aS'[07:06] <Logan_> Noskcaj: I think that a package maintainer would know what it means\xe2\x80\xa6 Being lintian clean is important for packages, as it ensures that they meet policy.\n'
p1070
aS"[07:06] <average_drifter> Here is another thing to ponder: How in God's name can you trust a mammoth of a window-manager like Gnome ? Why I'm asking this ? It is immense, it's like a huuuUUuuuuUUge pile of code put together, it will have bugs *FOR_SURE*. There is no hope in expecting it to be perfect. In fact, the more code is in there, and the more features , the more imperfect it is, the more buggy it is. Now i3 and wmii are both minimalist window managers. And dwm is ano\n"
p1071
aS'[07:07] <Noskcaj> Logan_, yes, but unless you can fix the bug yourself, i dont think much will happen, could you do something to make "normal" people understand it\n'
p1072
aS'[07:07] <average_drifter> MK`: sudo aptitude purge gnome gnome2 gnome3\n'
p1073
aS'[07:07] <Logan_> Noskcaj: Okay, will do.\n'

aS'[07:07] <average_drifter> MK`: actually just remove\n'
p1075

p1076
aS'[07:08] <dr_willis> best to not use aptitude any more.\n'

aS"[07:08] <MK`> dr_willis that's what I'm doing. But, I am unsure where the settings are...\n"
p1082
aS'[07:08] <average_drifter> dr_willis: oh ? why is that ?\n'
p1083
aS'[07:08] <dr_willis> !aptitude\n'
p1084
aS'[07:08] <ubottu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.\n'
p1085
aS'[07:09] <Noskcaj> Logan_, thanks, i will check it then mark it as new again\n'
p1086
aS'[07:09] <MK`> the most recent file edited was the clock, which I changed the settings of a few minutes before adding the new panel.\n'
p1087
aS'[07:09] <dr_willis> MK`:  make a backup directory. and just move whatever seems gnome related. :)\n'
p1088
aS'[07:09] <MK`> ok :P\n'
p1089
aS'[07:09] <dr_willis> MK`:  not like its hard to resetup whatever changes you mad\n'
p1090
aS'[07:09] <average_drifter> MK`:  ~/.gnome*\n'
p1091
aS'[07:10] <average_drifter> dr_willis: the best reset is a removal\n'
p1092
aS'[07:10] <dr_willis>  .gnome* .gtk* perhaps just  nautiuls/metacity connfigs would be all needed\n'
p1093
aS"[07:10] <MK`> there's no .gnome, only .gconf :P\n"
p1094
aS'[07:10] <dr_willis> average_drifter:  the problem is your pacakage removeing will NOT RESET USER SETTINGS...\n'
p1095

aS'[07:11] <bazhang> average_drifter, please dont comment further if you dont know\n'
p1101
aS'[07:11] <average_drifter> dr_willis: my suggestions are valid because if you remove gnome then there is *no* *more* panel to get wrong or to cause any error\n'
p1102
aS'[07:12] <average_drifter> instead using a tiling window manager can be extremely productive and less of a hassle\n'
p1103
aS'[07:12] <average_drifter> that is what I suggested\n'
p1104
aS'[07:12] <dr_willis> average_drifter:  and thats not what they were asking to do.. so you are not helping.\n'
p1105
aS'[07:12] <jagginess> "\x08<\x08average_drifter\x08> MK`:  ~/.gnome*"   << no.no, and "no"\n'

p1107
aS'[07:12] <MK`> I noted your suggestion.\n'
p1108

aS'[07:23] <jagginess> topper4125, yeah. i heard they are good, cuse canonical has a stake with them.. canonical works with system76\n'

p1139
aS'[07:24] <MK`> Thundarr: 3 years for non-LTS releases.\n'
p1140
aS"[07:24] <Thundarr> ah, ok ty. that's still more than enough.\n"
p1141
aS'[07:24] <misterno> what is the purpose of having 1499 users in channel when only dozen really talk\n'
p1142
aS"[07:24] <MK`> 10.04 and 12.04 are LTS, but 10.11, 11.04, 11.10 are not. it's every 4th release.\n"
p1143
aS'[07:25] <average_drifter> misterno: because they need regulations and policies and police and laws here\n'
p1144
aS"[07:25] <jagginess> misterno, well why have 50 thousand friends when you only really care for five? It's called facebook..\n"

aS"[07:25] <average_drifter> misterno: didn't you know there's a Ubuntu Supreme court ?\n"
p1148
aS"[07:25] <topper4125> jagginess, that's what I heard too. I was on their website, looks like everything ships with 12.10 (for now)... curious to know if I could request a machine with latest LTS instead though... they come with some PPA's they manage, and a few other goodies that I'm not sure if I formatted and reinstalled 12.04, i would be able to 'get' without a lot of problems\n"
p1149
aS'[07:25] <misterno> is this overcompensating in numbers for lack of something else? :)\n'
p1150
aS'[07:26] <average_drifter> misterno: you have a point .. I must say\n'
p1151
aS"[07:26] <jagginess> topper4125, it's not to worry.. you shouldn't have a problem tailoring it to your particular needs..\n"
p1152
aS"[07:27] <MK`> I must say, I was surprised I didn't have dconf-tools installed. I thought it was default.\n"
p1153
aS"[07:27] <jagginess> topper4125, there's video interviews of managers/etc-- they work with canonical..\n"

p1158
aS'[07:28] <kylescottmcgill> Does anyone know if i disable Gnome-Keyring etc, will it break all my other gnome-control-center stuff namely wifi + misc ?\n'
p1159
aS"[07:28] <MK`> kylescottmcgill: pretty sure that'd break wifi\n"
p1160
aS'[07:28] <dr_willis> kylescottmcgill:  why disable it?\n'
p1161
aS'[07:28] <average_drifter> MK`: just grep through the 99999 configuration files in .gconf  and find the right xml with the terminal .. probably ..\n'
p1162
aS"[07:28] <jagginess> kylescottmcgill, probably not.. but it will break your computer's heart\n"
p1163
aS'[07:29] <dr_willis> MK`:  Backgrouind jobs? bg/fg commands perhaps\n'

aS'[07:30] <elky> average_drifter, your snark is not welcome here.\n'
p1166
aS'[07:30] <kylescottmcgill> dr_willis: im using Awesome WM, and everytime i go to start anything i have to sudo prior to opening it so that it can use Gnome-Keyring, also i cant really start it as its embedded into lightgdm startup process, so its either i remove lightgdm and replace it with slim, and use a .xinitrc file, or i disable gnome-keyring and fend for myself etc, i can use wicd for networking but meh\n'
p1167
aS'[07:30] <average_drifter> jagginess: useless you say ? https://gist.github.com/6a8d0d36acca59af573e\n'
p1168
aS'[07:31] <average_drifter> I already found where the gnome-terminal is placed in the ~/.gconf\n'
p1169
aS'[07:31] <dr_willis> hmm.. gnome-keyring asks once here  when it starts up if its not started.. then i never notice it again\n'
p1170
aS'[07:31] <kylescottmcgill> jagginess: macbooks have no heart\n'
p1171

aS'[07:31] <kylescottmcgill> dr_willis: are you using a different WM too ?\n'
p1175
aS'[07:31] <MK`> I ran gnome-panel from the terminal, needed to just kick it off the terminal so I could close it X)\n'
p1176
aS"[07:32] <dr_willis> kylescottmcgill:  im using 'startx' go launch gnome-shell at the moment. I think its done the same thing with other wm's when i was testing them last month.\n"
p1177
aS"[07:32] <dr_willis> MK`:  command & , then use the 'exit' command is one way.\n"
p1178
aS"[07:32] <dr_willis> MK`:  or 'ctrl-z' then 'bg' then 'exit'\n"
p1179
aS'[07:32] <MK`> ah yes, &. I forgot.\n'
p1180
aS'[07:33] <dr_willis> Just hitting the terminal close button can close apps spawned by the terminal. so i always use close.\n'
p1181
aS'[07:33] <kylescottmcgill> yeah, see i could use that, the startx .xinitrc approach, but i dont see a way to get that working with lightgdm, not yet anyway\n'
p1182
aS"[07:33] <yassination_> hey guys, happy new year, I have a problem... after installing KDE desktop environment my HDMI port can't be detected by ubuntu, even when I use xrandr it's not listed, I need help?\n"
p1183
aS'[07:33] <dr_willis> kylescottmcgill:  you could define your own whatevber.desktop session for lightdm to use to run whatever you want.\n'
p1184
aS'[07:34] <dr_willis> most of the *dm managers will use the same whatever.desktop definitions.\n'

aS'[09:20] <ElectricPrism> how do I get to the official linuxmint channel? Is it on this server? I tried joining and got sent to ##linuxmint\n'
p1413
aS'[09:21] <nightfly_> ElectricPrism: just a guess, but is your nick registered and authed?\n'
p1414
aS'[09:21] <Noskcaj> ElectricPrism, Official support channel is #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org\n'
p1415
aS"[09:22] <ElectricPrism> Noskcaj: Ill try it, im authed for sure. I was hoping to ask their users why they prefer that specific distro should prove an interesting conversation since I can't get into it for some reason\n"
p1416
aS'[09:22] <topper4125> Official support channel is #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org\n'
p1417
aS"[09:24] <topper4125> one of the reasons I don't use mint is because of some of the political views of the founder\n"
p1418
aS'[09:25] <Thundarr> interesting. like what? have a link I can read up?\n'
p1419
aS'[09:25] <ElectricPrism> Their art really was a turnoff for me personally, could never get into their style\n'
p1420
aS"[09:26] <topper4125> he's one of those tinfoil hat wearing holocost denying guys... http://jay4rest.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/linux-mint-founder-is-against-israel/\n"
p1421
aS'[09:27] <ElectricPrism> fascinating\n'
p1422
aS'[09:27] <Thundarr> lol. wow.\n'
p1423
aS'[09:27] <Thundarr> yeah that kind of stunts my interest in it.\n'
p1424
aS'[09:29] <ElectricPrism> I just dont understand why its @ the top of distrowatch, I have no problem supporting a company that wants to see profit from their creation\n'
p1425
aS'[09:29] <Thundarr> israel should officially adopt linux mint as their distro of choice.\n'
p1426
aS'[09:29] <Thundarr> heh\n'
p1427
aS'[09:30] <ElectricPrism> XD\n'
p1428
aS"[09:30] <Thundarr> I'm just trying to decide what to run\n"
p1429
aS"[09:30] <Thundarr> word is that win 9 is going even more heavily into the 'tile' crap of 8\n"
p1430
aS'[09:31] <topper4125> I have no problem with monitization in linux... with big money comes big developers (steam for example)\n'
p1431
aS"[09:31] <ElectricPrism> I'm running Sabayon right now, I like a lot of things about Ubuntu based distros. Thundarr: Yeah, Windows 8 made me officially move to linux, now all I need is photoshop running fairly well so I can continue work for clients\n"
p1432
aS'[09:32] <topper4125> I think if steam can show a big profit other software houses like Adobe will follow them\n'
p1433
aS'[09:32] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: if adobe followed along with steam I think windows would crumble\n'
p1434
aS'[09:32] <topper4125> yup me too! :D\n'
p1435
aS'[09:33] <theadmin> topper4125: So far Adobe is doing completely the opposite. They dropped Flash for Linux, for instance.\n'
p1436
aS'[09:33] <ElectricPrism> interesting, gotta admit I never was a fan of flash, but the lack of it sucks for sure\n'
p1437
aS"[09:34] <theadmin> ElectricPrism: They'll continue to provide security updates for 5 years or something, after that Flash will only be available as part of Google Chrome\n"
p1438
aS'[09:34] <theadmin> Mozilla also wokrs on their own Flash implementation\n'
p1439
aS'[09:34] <topper4125> Steam said something along the lines of "the future of gaming is *not* in windows"... if that is true... and for as big as gaming is financially... Linux has a huge opertunity to grow.\n'
p1440
aS'[09:35] <Thundarr> blah. valve just said all that crap because their own market is going to conflict with windows marketplace.\n'
p1441
aS'[09:35] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I agree, I actually foregoe console gaming and own a number of steam games. I just love that on the computer my games will run in all future OS versions unlike PS 1 > PS 2 > PS3 > PS 4, etc...\n'
p1442
aS'[09:35] <Malsasa_> Yes, and game platforms are not Steam only :) There are another platform beside Steam :) CMIIW\n'
p1443
aS'[09:36] <Thundarr> more games just need to run in a browser like quake live\n'
p1444
aS'[09:36] <Thundarr> thats pretty damn awesome cross compatibility there\n'
p1445
aS"[09:36] <ElectricPrism> Malsasa_: But I could see Steam deciding to base a open source distro on FreeBSD if they wanted to maintain the base, otherwise yeah they'd just have Canonical handle all the linux work since GPL pretty much forces everyone to open their work up\n"
p1446
aS'[09:37] <ElectricPrism> Thundarr: Oh I agree, especially with WebGL games\n'
p1447
aS"[09:37] <ElectricPrism> meh #linuxmint-help wasn't that helpful, they just told me to run the livecd and that it was pretty much ubuntu but not explaining how it differed QQ\n"
p1448
aS'[09:37] <topper4125> that *is* something M$ has said in the past "the future of computing is 100% cloud, os,apps, data everything. for some reason, that scares me a bit, but it seems that they are trying to make that their future\n'
p1449
aS"[09:38] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I think businesses are smarter than trusting the cloud* if not- they'll learn the hard way imo\n"
p1450
aS"[09:38] <topper4125> 'tis true ElectricPrism\n"
p1451
aS"[09:38] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: plus I would think business owners are control freaks and would like their data stored locally - I wouldn't mind having apps in the cloud, but not my personal data\n"
p1452
aS'[09:40] <ElectricPrism> I learned the other day that Debian has a official forum - I was surprised though at how little activity it has compared to the ubuntu forums\n'
p1453
aS'[09:41] <ElectricPrism> Ubuntu Forum Posts: 11,795,654   Debian Forum Posts: 439,573\n'
p1454
aS"[09:41] <topper4125> with plugins like firesheep out there showing how easy exploits can be exposed.. you would think everyone fear personal info in the air and in the cloud. but then again M$ still has a lot to learn when it comes to computer security doesn't it? Lol\n"
p1455
aS"[09:42] <ElectricPrism> I'm in favor of the idea that bad security comes from bad programmers\n"
p1456
aS'[09:43] <ElectricPrism> I often hear arguments that php is insecure, but the reality is that php has a lot more code created by developers, and the quality of the code is less because the language is soo popular\n'
p1457
aS'[09:43] <Thundarr> watching Tron Uprising. This show is gorgeous.\n'
p1458
aS'[09:43] <ElectricPrism> a cartoon?\n'
p1459
aS'[09:43] <Thundarr> lot of known voice talent too\n'
p1460
aS'[09:43] <Thundarr> its cgi\n'
p1461
aS'[09:44] <Thundarr> its beautiful. the style is amazing. lot of love goes into it.\n'
p1462
aS'[09:44] <ElectricPrism> seeing tron in the metreon really was inspiring\n'
p1463
aS'[09:44] <ElectricPrism> the style looks cool\n'
p1464
aS'[09:45] <ElectricPrism> has anyone ever tried ripping dpkg out of a debian distro and grafting it onto say gentoo or arch?\n'
p1465
aS'[09:46] <topper4125> ElectricPrism, not me personally... I ran Arch for about 6 months and came back to ubuntu w/ Xfce DE\n'
p1466
aS'[09:47] <topper4125> I liked arch, but I spent too much time babysitting the OS... IMHO\n'
p1467
aS'[09:47] <Catbuntu> Arch is... :(\n'
p1468
aS'=== LT is now known as Guest88651\n'
p1469
aS"[09:47] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I have arch on my laptop and it's been an enlighening experience, but I admit I really miss Ubuntu Software Center and the vast number of packages on ubuntu, the #1 reason I value it\n"
p1470
aS'[09:47] <Catbuntu> I like XFCE.\n'
p1471
aS'[09:47] <Catbuntu> But it\'s too "conservative" for me, I preffer Unity, gnome-panel or Cinnamon.\n'
p1472
aS'[09:48] <Catbuntu> brb\n'
p1473
aS"[09:48] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: Yeah, that makes sense - It's really cool to be running SystemD, I find it easier to control services, but I don't need a highly secure system although I hate having software I dont know about since linux is soo vast in its software, and the names are cryptic and confusing\n"
p1474
aS'[09:48] <topper4125> Catbuntu XFCE is my fav DE... just the speed, and customization of it are perfect for me.\n'
p1475
aS"[09:49] <ElectricPrism> Catbuntu: I can't remember if it was XFCE or LXDE, one of those had a beautiful Alt+F2 run dialog, but I just can't get into unity\n"
p1476
aS"[09:49] <topper4125> ElectricPrism, ya that's my problem too...\n"
p1477
aS'[09:49] <ElectricPrism> ya\n'
p1478
aS'[09:49] <Malsasa_> topper4125: i like KDE :)\n'
p1479
aS'[09:49] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I thought about creating a linux accronym dictionary because stuff like /etc/fstab really should be named /config/filesystem-table\n'
p1480
aS'[09:50] <ElectricPrism> but I also respect that having the unix filesystem gives linux strength as a Unic operating system\n'
p1481
aS'[09:50] <Malsasa_> ElectricPrism: we can create a wallpaper from that dictionary\n'
p1482
aS'[09:50] <topper4125> I did find that installing Ubuntu-mini and building my system up from scratch about as good as and Arch install...\n'
p1483
aS'[09:50] <ElectricPrism> :)\n'
p1484
aS'[09:50] <TheFlipside> can someoney tell me what the countdown on the ubuntu website is for?\n'
p1485
aS"[09:50] <topper4125> ... if you're into minimal install idealls\n"
p1486
aS'[09:51] <topper4125> best guess TheFlipside, is Ubuntu for Android\n'
p1487
aS'[09:51] <TheFlipside> ah thanks\n'
p1488
aS'[09:51] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: Good point, I actually dislike that pacman file manager\'s options are again "cryptic" and "confusing"\n'
p1489
aS'[09:52] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: Imagine me trying to instruct me to give my wife instructions over the phone on the correct pacman command to update the system - "you\'re gonna have a bad time"\n'
p1490
aS"[09:52] <topper4125> I had a couple 'plug-ins' for pacman that kind of made it act like apt-get, it was a little easier, but not much\n"
p1491
aS'[09:52] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: how do I get the minimal install - I would love to use that, it sounds good\n'
p1492
aS'[09:53] <snx> where can I get ubuntu 13 iso\n'

aS"[09:53] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: yaoucht was pretty cool but then again the name was dumb, kindof like when you're a n00b and you're trying to remember how to spell nautilus\n"

p1506
aS'[09:55] <kylescottmcgill> i love arch, but i suffer from that and more on a mac :(\n'
p1507
aS'[09:55] <ElectricPrism> I gotta admit that the one that I really wanted on ubuntu that I lacked was fbcondecor and plymouth, usplash looks like garbage on my 260gtx and I love having a background image on my TTY1, makes my OS look pro\n'

p1511
aS'[09:56] <ElectricPrism> Wait... did they switch from USplash to Plymouth?\n'
p1512
aS'[09:56] <topper4125> not sure\n'
p1513
aS'[09:56] <ElectricPrism> I see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Plymouth\n'
p1514
aS'[09:57] <dr_willis> Plymouth is the default on ubuntu for quite some time now\n'
p1515
aS'[09:57] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: Sublime is mint\n'
p1516
aS'[09:57] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: What does that mean, mint as in prime?\n'
p1517
aS'[09:57] <kylescottmcgill> mint as in its awesome\n'

aS'[09:58] <kylescottmcgill> ya, its like the only software i feel proud to have brought, like it went to a good cause sorta thing\n'
p1520
aS'[09:58] <Catbuntu> back\n'
p1521
aS'[09:58] <kylescottmcgill> ... wasnt a waste of money is better said\n'
p1522
aS"[09:58] <ElectricPrism> dr_willis - maybe its my grub2 resolution then idk why bootup is so glitchy, I just can't wait till ubuntu switches to SystemD and possibly Wayland - although nowadays we're finally getting abilities that make X Server Screen hosting on another computer useful - It just took 30 years\n"
p1523
aS'[09:59] <dr_willis> you can set Grub2 to use a Text mode boot menu.\n'
p1524
aS'[09:59] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: you can change your grub2 boot settings to accomodate for your larger screen size\n'
p1525
aS"[09:59] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: Do you get any additional features from buying it? I know they're very liberal and dont limit a trial period\n"
p1526
aS'[10:00] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: none what so ever, trial version is supposed to be limited at some time in the near future i believe\n'
p1527
aS'[10:00] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: Yeah, I might need to, I\'m not sure really, what I do know is my Samsung SyncMaster 710n dual 17" 1280x1024 aren\'t probably identified in Ubuntu so I need to set the resolution using xrandr :( QQ\n'

p1531
aS'[10:02] <kylescottmcgill> lol sorry to hear your bad luck\n'
p1532
aS"[10:02] <ElectricPrism> A friend of mine told me that hard drives above 2TB have the data too condensed that it's starting to have problems reading and writing as clearly though, I wish I had the source\n"
p1533
aS"[10:03] <topper4125> I've only donated to 3 software houses :( Sent money to the Gimp, ZorinOS (cuz its pretty) and Canonical.\n"
p1534
aS"[10:03] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: My bad luck was caused by Windows chkdisk, It destroyed my NTFS $MFT because I used the drive often in Ubuntu, since then I got a 3TB EXT4 that I'm enjoying\n"

aS'[10:05] <morfeo_81> Happy new year!!!\n'
p1542
aS'[10:05] <ElectricPrism> If I enabled the unstable repos would it be the same as running Ubuntu as a rolling release distro?\n'
p1543
aS'[10:06] <morfeo_81> How can createpermantly  ubuntu on usb external drive with my preference\n'
p1544
aS'[10:06] <kylescottmcgill> I havnt done that, but i think it wouldnt be like using Arch, i think unstable is more or less things are going to break, etc\n'
p1545
aS'[10:06] <kylescottmcgill> morfeo_81: do you mean an installation on a USB Drive?\n'
p1546
aS"[10:07] <ElectricPrism> you need a motherboard that can boot from usb, and a USB ideally 16GB+ I imagine it'd be simple, USB 3 is better, USB 2 is doable\n"
p1547
aS'[10:07] <topper4125> ElectricPrism, ya I think that gives puts your system on the bleeding edge of releases. (read into that a lot of breaking and babysitting of the OS)\n'
p1548
aS'[10:08] <morfeo_81> <kylescottmcgill>:no I mean to have ubuntu portable on different computer with my preference\n'
p1549
aS"[10:09] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I think I like the idea of rolling release better, Im tired of Sabayon and others having old software like Gnome 3.4 instead of 3.6, maybe I'll try to make it work with Unity,\n"
p1550
aS'[10:09] <Catbuntu> Which is the best DE Gnome2-like, Cinnamon or XFCE?\n'
p1551
aS'[10:09] <kylescottmcgill> oh right, i think you might have some issues with things like GFX Drivers and Wifi drivers etc, not to mention different CPU types, but i think you can, just install to a USB opposed to your HDD, and you will need to make sure you have a MBR on the USB\n'
p1552
aS"[10:09] <topper4125> ah... ya I'm the opposit with that... gimmie stability! :D\n"

p1555
aS"[10:10] <ElectricPrism> In unity I can't stand two things: The menu is on the left and I have no options to move it to the bottom, and 2) The close, max, min window controls when maximized are hidden in the global menu bar - has anyone solved either of these?\n"
p1556
aS'[10:10] <Catbuntu> Well, I know.\n'

p1560
aS'[10:10] <ElectricPrism> Catbuntu: Cinnamon almost won me over\n'
p1561
aS'[10:11] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: i believe there is app that gives you more control over the menu bar, but generally i use Gnome 3 (PPA is 3.6) or Awesome WM, which is a Tiling Window Manager\n'
p1562
aS'[10:11] <topper4125> the only way I solved it was to switch to XFCE... Unity destroys freedom to customize the desktop\n'
p1563
aS'[10:11] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: What is a Tiling Window Manager, I hear it mentioned a lot\n'
p1564
aS'[10:11] <ElectricPrism> amen\n'
p1565
aS'[10:12] <ElectricPrism> I would accept it, I even like the global menu and menu search, but those two things hurt my workflow\n'
p1566
aS'[10:12] <kylescottmcgill> The windows dont float naturally, evetyhing is more or less bound to the keyboard, so when im swapping apps i rarely use the mouse\n'

aS'[10:13] <morfeo_81> Best way to get portable Ubuntu on USB Drive?\n'
p1568
aS'[10:13] <ElectricPrism> in windows I had the panel on the bottom and a dock on each side of my screen to quickly launch work folders, etc... and I have 4:3 monitors so the whole design for "widescreen" doesn\'t benefit me :(\n'
p1569
aS'[10:13] <kylescottmcgill> Check out Google Images, you will be sure to find some examples, just get ready for a lot of work, normally there is a GUI to configure a Tiling Window manager, normally its in a scripting language\n'
p1570
aS'[10:13] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: are the windows always fullscreen? because I find TTY1-7 just like having open tabs in Firefox and totally useful\n'

aS'[12:20] <kylescottmcgill> you could also chown the directory back to who you are\n'
p1781
aS'[12:20] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, actually i checked the permissions at that file and it was owned by me.\n'

p1800

p1831
aS'[12:38] <kylescottmcgill> if you had to sudo to touch it, this means your /home/<user> folder is owned by root, and you should change that, as for Wine and Fullscreen, that will be unrelated i would imagine, and i wouldnt have a clue, #wine-hq might have a better idea sorry\n'

p1838
aS'[12:42] <kylescottmcgill> sudo chown -R marcus.marcus /home/marcus ; sudo chmod 755 /home/marcus ; should set up your home dir properly\n'
p1839
aS'[12:43] <kylescottmcgill> as for your ice issue, the above file permissions should fix it, if it doesnt the only thing that teh internet suggests is to reinstall gnome-session, but i think thats a little extreme\n'

p1865
aS'[13:17] <alazare619> http://pastebin.com/gDGhGuqD\n'
p1866
aS'[13:18] <alazare619> the one with the uuid is the drive mounted currently to /media/storage wich is where id like to be able to keep it if possible\n'
p1867
aS'[13:18] <Cong> I have a partition called Storage too!\n'
p1868
aS'[13:19] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, Yes everything works like a charm!\n'
p1869
aS'[13:20] <kylescottmcgill> nice\n'
p1870
aS"[13:20] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, If your up for it I would really appreciate if you could help me out to move my home directory to another storage (already mounted). It's pretty much the same as I did now but before I messed up and since I have a clean start now I would like to do it the right way :)\n"
p1871
aS'[13:21] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, For now my home directory is stored on the ssd that the system runs from. I would like it to be stored at /sdb1 which is mounted as /media/Storage\n'
p1872
aS'[13:21] <kylescottmcgill> blackline: is it external to your computer?\n'
p1873
aS"[13:22] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, it's internal\n"
p1874
aS'[13:22] <kylescottmcgill> ok\n'
p1875
aS"[13:22] <blackline> but i've intentionally mounted it under media just since i wanted it listed as a drive in nautilus\n"
p1876
aS"[13:22] <blackline> i would be ok with changing the mountpoint if /media/ isn't the proper way to go\n"
p1877
aS'[13:22] <kylescottmcgill> there is a couple of ways you could do this\n'
p1878
aS'[13:23] <blackline> having it in /media "feels" kind of external\n'
p1879
aS'[13:23] <blackline> Any ideas on that. Would it look more proper to mount it elsewhere before I go on moving stuff?\n'
p1880
aS'[13:23] <kylescottmcgill> 1) would be to setup a new user, then use the /media/x/x/homedir/ as the home dir, or 2) you could mv everything on to the hdd then modify your fstab records\n'
p1881
aS'[13:24] <kylescottmcgill> quick question, what format is your /media/ drive?\n'
p1882
aS"[13:24] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, as for now it's mounted in fstab, i've put it there\n"
p1883
aS"[13:24] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, it's ext4\n"
p1884
aS'[13:24] <kylescottmcgill> it would need to be ext4 for it work properly\n'
p1885
aS'[13:24] <kylescottmcgill> ok awesome, you shouldnt have any problems with Permissions etc then\n'
p1886
aS'[13:25] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, no. this should work. i just want it to be placed fany when it comes to mountpoint :)\n'
p1887
aS'[13:25] <kylescottmcgill> if you move everything on to the drive, then change you fstab to point /home to the new location you should be sweet\n'
p1888
aS'[13:25] <blackline> ...and of course working :)\n'
p1889
aS'[13:25] <blackline> sounds great.\n'
p1890
aS'[13:26] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: whats the storage type? FAT32/EXT4/X\n'
p1891
aS'[13:26] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, so how do i perform the whole moving?\n'
p1892
aS'[13:27] <alazare619> ext4\n'
p1893
aS'[13:27] <alazare619> as you can see in the fstab currently\n'
p1894
aS'[13:27] <alazare619> its the line with the UUID refrence as its the only NON virtual partition\n'
p1895
aS'[13:28] <kylescottmcgill> blackline: you might want to logout, and change to another tab CTL + ALT + F1 and login as root\n'
p1896
aS'[13:28] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, and then?\n'
p1897
aS'[13:28] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, should i make a new user first to be able to enter in desktop if i get locked out? :)\n'
p1898
aS'[13:29] <kylescottmcgill> then cp -prvf /home/marcus /media/path/to/other/hdd/\n'
p1899
aS'[13:29] <kylescottmcgill> i would cp first, incase it dies part way through or something wierd\n'
p1900
aS'[13:29] <kylescottmcgill> thats why you would cp first\n'
p1901
aS'[13:30] <kylescottmcgill> then once we have change the fstab, you can always revert the fstab and go back to normal\n'
p1902
aS'[13:30] <LKiS> please anyone can tell me what alternative software for open yahoo messenger url like this -> ymsgr:sendIM?noobs\n'
p1903
aS'[13:30] <kylescottmcgill> after the /home has completed, i would advise to mv /home /home-old for a backup\n'
p1904
aS'[13:30] <alazare619> kyles basically what im going to do is have a bare drive, that no matter what file is created under wich user it will always be a 777 folder and a 666 file\n'
p1905
aS'[13:31] <alazare619> so that any user can read write any file\n'
p1906
aS'[13:31] <alazare619> under any folder\n'
p1907
aS'[13:32] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: so you need fstab umask options\n'

p1909

aS'[13:33] <alazare619> i just want it all 777\n'

aS'[13:33] <alazare619> jsut to make it easy\n'
p1913
aS'[13:34] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: just finding a proper and quick way to do it, there is a couple\n'
p1914
aS'[13:35] <kylescottmcgill> fstab umask, or ACL\n'
p1915
aS'[13:35] <kylescottmcgill> you kinda want the same as a samba share, anyone can read/write/execute from it etc\n'
p1916
aS'[13:38] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: im pretty sure you want umask=000 in your fstab\n'
p1917

p1926

aS'[15:50] <repozitor> ThinkT510, do you understand my problem?\n'
p2179
aS'[15:50] <srhb> repozitor: The destination computer is on your local net?\n'
p2180
aS'[15:50] <repozitor> no\n'
p2181
aS'[15:50] <srhb> repozitor: Well, you need the remote IP.\n'
p2182
aS'[15:50] <repozitor> i know if it exist on my local network, then i can use SSH\n'
p2183
aS'[15:51] <repozitor> i should get remote IP from ISP?\n'
p2184
aS'[15:51] <srhb> repozitor: Easier to get it from the person with the destination computer\n'

p2195
aS"[15:54] <repozitor> i don't know what is this\n"
p2196
aS'[15:54] <repozitor> what is this?\n'
p2197
aS'[15:54] <srhb> repozitor: The port that the SSH server responds on. Your router should forward requests to that port to your computer with the SSH server.\n'
p2198
aS'[15:54] <repozitor> and my desktop destination computer ip is :5.199.140.67\n'
p2199
aS'[15:55] <repozitor> both my LP and my desktop computer connected to net, using ADSL2+ from ISP\n'

aS'[15:56] <repozitor> and my ip shared between 8 another user, this is not dedicated\n'

aS'[15:56] <kqr> i have encountered a strange problem with my ubuntu. after I rebooted last, all xft fonts have gone huge. what previously looked like 12 pt now looks like 18 pt. this applies both to my terminal, my status bar and my web browser. it does not happen with my email client or music player. does anyone have any idea what could have happened?\n'
p2204
aS'[15:56] <srhb> repozitor: That depends on your router/the equipment you got from your ISP.\n'
p2205
aS'[15:57] <repozitor> srhb, is there exist any external server for this goal?\n'
p2206
aS'[15:57] <repozitor> for example how teamviewer works fine?\n'
p2207
aS'[15:57] <srhb> repozitor: Team viewer uses a middle man, afaik.\n'
p2208
aS"[15:57] <repozitor> team viewer don't need to have any special device\n"
p2209
aS'[15:57] <srhb> repozitor: But yes, you can set up reverse tunnels on an external server if you have access to one.\n'
p2210
aS'[15:57] <repozitor> yes, i mean is there exist any MITM to establish this connection?\n'
p2211
aS'[15:58] <srhb> repozitor: Sure, any VPN service could do.\n'
p2212
aS'[15:58] <repozitor> VPN on desktop computer?\n'
p2213
aS'[15:58] <repozitor> VPN service*\n'
p2214
aS'[15:58] <srhb> repozitor: Any Linux computer that you can reach on port 22 and have access to would do fine\n'
p2215
aS'[15:59] <repozitor> for VPN we need to have domain, yes?\n'
p2216
aS'[15:59] <srhb> repozitor: Nope. As I said, any port 22 reachable address will suffice.\n'

p2222
aS"[16:00] <srhb> repozitor: I think your questions are not really very Ubuntu-related and much more about basic networkiing. Perhaps you could search for basic information on accessing port 22 remotely on Google. :) I'm sure there are dedicated channels to help if you get stuck\n"

p2228
aS'[16:03] <repozitor> my last request is can you tell me what i search on google?\n'
p2229
aS'[16:03] <rick2> BluesKaj, maybe those sites changed API, and no update was released for the webapps ... I imagine, but dunno\n'

p2271
aS'[16:13] <krywk> When I installed JACK, it asked to use realtime kernel. If by low latency kernel you mean that, then yes.\n'

aS'[17:14] <malefiku> For what?\n'
p2568
aS'[17:14] <JPMH> malefiku: Hans-Martin He could use the re-direct method that is there for the non-www and find a free host that would support the ONE page he would need for the re-direct\n'

aS'[17:15] <gvo> malefiku: Just find another service.\n'
p2575
aS'[17:16] <JPMH> malefiku: look at the non-www record - it points to a server somewhere that is doing the re-direct - just set the www. to have a CNAME that points it at the non-www and make sure that the re-direct is what you want\n'
p2576
aS'[17:16] <malefiku> All right\n'
p2577
aS'[17:16] <malefiku> But in my onlydomains.com panel\n'
p2578
aS'[17:17] <JPMH> malefiku: does the domain registery provide the DNS that you are using?  If so, surely they have a web interface where you can change that www. record to be a CNAME pointing at the main one\n'
p2579
aS'[17:17] <malefiku> At my registrar, beneath the DNS section I have an option called Setup Web Redirection\n'
p2580
aS'[17:17] <malefiku> It has two option 302 temporary\n'

aS'[17:18] <malefiku> And 301 permanent\n'

aS'[17:18] <malefiku> I have also, after DNS records, a 301 redirection\n'

p2585
aS'[17:19] <JPMH> malefiku: the issue is that you did not do it for the www one\n'

p2587
aS'[17:19] <malefiku> Read carefully what I wrote\n'
p2588
aS'[17:19] <malefiku> I made a 301 redirect\n'
p2589
aS'[17:20] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: so you need the web redirection, but not the cname, and you need to remove the redirection set up at blogger.com\n'
p2590
aS'[17:20] <malefiku> But not from www.marian32.com to marian32.com\n'
p2591
aS'[17:20] <malefiku> But to marian32-blog.blogspot.com\n'
p2592
aS'[17:20] <JPMH> malefiku: as I say - I see the redirect and the correct DNS A record for the non-www  - but the www is different - as Hans-Martin  pointed out - it has a CNAME record\n'

aS'[17:51] <jrib> user109125: where does ctrl-shift-insert work?\n'
p2733
aS'[17:51] <Muphrid> Em_: you can open software-properties-gtk or search for "software sources" in the dash. theres a tab called additional drivers, those are the drivers that do not come installed by default\n'

p2735

p2740
aS"[17:52] <jrib> user109125: and you're sure it's not the same output as either ctrl-shift-v or shift-insert in your terminal?\n"
p2741
aS'[17:53] <Muphrid> Em_: the list is not long, it is no more than 5 or 6 for most machines\n'
p2742
aS'[17:53] <user109125> yes, absolutely\n'
p2743
aS"[17:53] <user109125> im copying out of keepass2 .. probably that's the cause of that weird behaviour\n"
p2744
aS'[17:54] <jrib> user109125: here, ctrl-shift-insert just pastes whatever I copy with ctrl-shift-c (which I can also paste with ctrl-shift-v)\n'
p2745
aS'[17:54] <Em_> Muphrid, so If my hardware drivers are not listed, then it would mean that they are installed right?\n'

aS"[20:16] <Tynach> Help! My Ubuntu installation will not boot. It's a bit of a long story as to what's happened though, but right now I believe either the filesystem or the LVM system is corrupt.\n"
p3127
aS"[20:18] <Tynach> I got a new graphics card, and installed it; but it wasn't stable because, I believe, my PSU isn't powerful enough to power everything. I unplugged a few hard drives I didn't currently use and got a 'stable' system back, but it began to act up again. So I tried running FSCK in recovery mode. That froze up, with no hard drive light blinking, so I rebooted. This happened 2 - 3 times. Now Linux won't boot, not even recovery mode.\n"

p3139
aS'[20:21] <Catbuntu> One question.\n'
p3140
aS'[20:21] <Gnea> One answer.\n'
p3141
aS'[20:21] <Catbuntu> I have a sda3 partition with this logical partitions:\n'
p3142
aS'[20:21] <bekks> Tynach: Then check wether it exists.\n'
p3143
aS'[20:21] <Catbuntu> sda5 (home), sda6 (ubuntu), sda7 (swap), sda9 (xubuntu), sda8 (mint)\n'
p3144
aS'[20:22] <Catbuntu> I want to remove sda8 and sda6 and add their space to sda5\n'
p3145
aS"[20:22] <Catbuntu> But I think I can't, because there're sda7 and sda9 in the middle\n"
p3146
aS'[20:22] <Tynach> bekks, how do I do that from WIndows? As far as I know, there are no LVM aware Linux file browsers on Windows.\n'
p3147
aS"[20:22] <Catbuntu> I could append sda6's space to sda5, but not sda8's space, could I?\n"
p3148
aS"[20:22] <bekks> Tynach: You'll do it from the busybox or a livecd.\n"
p3149
aS'[20:23] <Tynach> bekks, do you know if 12.04 supports LVM with its live CD? I know 11.10 and before did not.\n'
p3150
aS'[20:23] <bekks> Catbuntu: You could move partitions and do what you want.\n'
p3151
aS'[20:23] <Catbuntu> How?\n'
p3152
aS'[20:23] <bekks> Catbuntu: By using gparted, e.g.\n'
p3153
aS"[20:23] <Gnea> Catbuntu: sure you could, they're logical\n"
p3154
aS'[20:23] <Catbuntu> So I can move the sda9 partition next to sda6?\n'
p3155
aS"[20:23] <Catbuntu> Oh, didn't know that\n"
p3156
aS'[20:24] <Gnea> well you said they were logical\n'
p3157
aS"[20:24] <Catbuntu> Then I'm gonna do that from a LiveDVD\n"
p3158
aS"[20:24] <Catbuntu> Yes, I think tey're, let me check\n"
p3159
aS'[20:24] <Gnea> sounds like a good idea\n'

p3189
aS"[20:29] <FloodBot1> Catbuntu: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.\n"

p3195
aS'[20:30] <mohawk> and it tells me to enter my passcode again\n'

aS'[20:38] <Nirvash> What does that mean?\n'

p3260
aS"[20:39] <Catbuntu> I already read that Gnea, I can't understand.\n"
p3261
aS'[20:39] <remontees> :D\n'
p3262
aS"[20:39] <Gnea> Catbuntu: well I can't help you if you don't make an effort to understand.\n"
p3263
aS'[20:40] <Catbuntu> I do Gnea.\n'
p3264
aS"[20:40] <skp1> Catbuntu: you're dumb.\n"
p3265
aS'[20:40] <Catbuntu> It says nothing about moving.\n'
p3266
aS'[20:40] <Catbuntu> If a partition has adjacent unallocated space, you can right-click it and select Resize/Move to enlarge the partition into the unallocated space.\n'
p3267
aS'[20:40] <Catbuntu> To specify a new partition size, click and drag the sliders or enter an exact number into the boxes.\n'
p3268
aS"[20:40] <Catbuntu> I don't want to change its size.\n"
p3269
aS'[20:40] <Catbuntu> I want to MOVE it.\n'
p3270
aS'[20:41] <bekks> skp1: Stop insulting people please.\n'
p3271
aS'[20:41] <bekks> Catbuntu: resizing a partition is NOT adding space before or after.\n'
p3272
aS"[20:41] <Catbuntu> bekks, that's what the website says.\n"
p3273
aS'[20:41] <Gnea> Catbuntu: okay, in order to MOVE a partition, you need to have FREE SPACE\n'
p3274
aS'[20:41] <bekks> Catbuntu: Add UNALLOCATED space before or after the partition. Before doing so, delete unwanted partitions.\n'
p3275
aS'[20:41] <Gnea> Catbuntu: UNALLOCATED space == FREE SPACE\n'
p3276
aS'[20:42] <Catbuntu> I know.\n'
p3277
aS'[20:42] <Gnea> well then load up the liveDVD and gparted and try messing with it\n'
p3278
aS'[20:42] <Catbuntu> So I just delete the sda6 and sda8 partitions.\n'
p3279
aS"[20:42] <Gnea> it won't do anything until you click apply so you have plenty of wiggle room to see how it works\n"
p3280
aS'[20:42] <bekks> Catbuntu: Create a backup of your system before.\n'
p3281
aS"[20:43] <Catbuntu> But there're wanted partitions behind the unallocated space in the bottom and the unallocated space in the top.\n"
p3282
aS'[20:43] <bekks> Then MOVE them.\n'
p3283
aS'[20:43] <Gnea> Catbuntu: is there anything important on them?\n'
p3284
aS'=== Elena is now known as Guest49113\n'
p3285

p3286

p3287
aS'[20:44] <bekks> Thats the most important thing.\n'
p3288
aS"[20:44] <Catbuntu> /home is at the top so it's safe\n"
p3289
aS'[20:44] <Gnea> yes, but you want to add to /home\n'
p3290
aS'[20:44] <bekks> Without a backup, nothing is safe.\n'
p3291
aS"[20:44] <Gnea> so you have to position /home so it's next to unallocated space\n"
p3292
aS'[20:44] <Gnea> also, if /home has anything important, BACK IT UP\n'
p3293
aS'[20:44] <Catbuntu> Yep\n'
p3294
aS"[20:44] <Catbuntu> Well, there's nothing important there I think\n"
p3295
aS'[20:45] <Gnea> you should be sure before continuing at this point.\n'
p3296
aS'[20:45] <bekks> Catbuntu: / is the most important thing for a linux system.\n'
p3297
aS'[20:45] <Catbuntu> bekks, but reinstalling Xubuntu is just a moment.\n'
p3298
aS'[20:46] <Catbuntu> oh, gosh\n'
p3299
aS"[20:46] <Catbuntu> I think I'll do that tomorrow\n"

aS"[20:46] <Catbuntu> There's no problem by copying things from an ext4 fs to a ntfs and vice-versa, is there?\n"
p3303
aS'[20:47] <bekks> Catbuntu: Wrong.\n'
p3304
aS"[20:47] <Gnea> not really, except that you'll lost permissions\n"
p3305
aS'[20:47] <Catbuntu> oh gosh\n'
p3306
aS'[20:47] <Gnea> so\n'
p3307
aS'[20:47] <bekks> Catbuntu: POSIX file permissions cannot be copy onto NTFS.\n'
p3308
aS'=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish\n'

p3316
aS'[20:49] <Catbuntu> And why not an ISO?\n'
p3317
aS'[20:49] <bekks> Catbuntu: You can even store that tarball on NTFS.\n'
p3318
aS'[20:49] <Gnea> tarball or iso work\n'
p3319
aS'[20:50] <Catbuntu> I already started the iso, so...\n'
p3320
aS"[20:50] <Gnea> doesn't matter, as long as the files are in a storage medium that preserves the permissions\n"
p3321
aS'[20:50] <bekks> No need to burn a DVD nowadays when it is possible to store things instead of burning them.\n'
p3322
aS'[20:50] <Catbuntu> Thanks for helping, sorry for being so stupid but I never did any serious partitioning tasks.\n'
p3323
aS'[20:50] <Catbuntu> bekks, just an ISO, I can mount it then.\n'

p3330
aS'[20:53] <Gnea> arooni-mobile: open a terminal and type the following: lsb_release -r    what does it say?\n'
p3331
aS'[20:53] <Hans-Martin> run the partial upgrade, then probably after a reboot you can update the rest\n'

aS'[20:54] <Gnea> arooni-mobile: what Hans-Martin said\n'

p3360
aS'[21:03] <joar> bekks: sudo apt-get install nvidia-updates\n'
p3361
aS"[21:03] <Gnea> joar: yes, everytime there's a new kernel, the nvidia driver needs to be recompiled. the system should take care of that for you as long as you installed nvidia from the repository and not from nvidia.com.\n"
p3362
aS'[21:04] <bekks> Gnea: Which only applies for major kernel updates.\n'
p3363
aS'[21:04] <Gnea> bekks: true.\n'
p3364
aS'[21:04] <joar> my current kernel is 3.5.16-21 or something\n'
p3365
aS'[21:05] <dencrypt> you can see your current kernel with "uname -r"\n'
p3366
aS'[21:05] <jagginess> joar, probably you mean 3.5.0-21\n'
p3367
aS'[21:05] <bekks> joar: Check it with uname -a\n'
p3368
aS'[21:05] <Gnea> joar: how did you install the nvidia driver the first time? via commandline or via the gui?\n'
p3369
aS"[21:05] <tin_nqn> People, I need to grab deb packages for online installation on a Quantal (12.10) amd64 . I'm in a machine with ubuntu 11.10 i386\n"
p3370
aS'[21:05] <joar> jagginess: 3.5.0-21, yes\n'
p3371
aS'[21:05] <tin_nqn> is it possible?\n'
p3372
aS'[21:05] <joar> bekks: ^\n'
p3373
aS'[21:05] <bekks> Gnea: Doesnt matter actually. You can use both approaches to install the driver from the repos.\n'
p3374
aS"[21:06] <joar> Gnea: I think I've done both on this machine.\n"
p3375
aS'[21:06] <joar> Just today, I checked aptitude show and the package nvidia-updates was marked as installed\n'
p3376
aS'[21:06] <Gnea> bekks: true, but one might be more thorough than the other, depending on what steps were taken at the cli\n'

aS'[21:07] <Gnea> I have a nvidia-current-updates and a nvidia-settings-updates\n'

aS'[21:08] <MicW> when i install using ebootstrap, how do i select a certain ubuntu release (especially "lubuntu")?\n'
p3386
aS'[21:08] <Gnea> joar: okay, well the ones that matter the most will be the glx and kernel packages.  dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep nvidia   should show you which ones are actually installed\n'
p3387
aS'[21:08] <bekks> MicW: Lubuntu is just Ubuntu with LXDE.\n'
p3388
aS'[21:08] <joar> When I installed the nvidia-current-updates package however, it told me it would not build the kernel module since the kernel sources were not installed.\n'
p3389
aS'[21:09] <Gnea> okay\n'
p3390
aS'[21:09] <bekks> joar: Then install the kernel sources.\n'
p3391
aS"[21:09] <MicW> i see. so if i only install xorg without any other stuff i'd get a minimal x, right?\n"
p3392

aS'[21:09] <jhutchins_wk> tin_nqn: Mixing releases is a great way to get to do a clean reinstall!\n'
p3396
aS'[21:10] <joar> I installed linux-headers-3.5.0-21 and then removed (--purge) and installed the nvidia-current-updates package, it said the same thing though.\n'

aS'[21:10] <joar> IIRC header install, nvidia removal, nvidia install has been the trick the times before.\n'
