[16:01] <rbasak> Hello all. The Canonical server team leads are both away at a company sprint this week, so I'm not sure it's worth having a meeting. Does anyone want one anyway, or shall we skip it?
[16:02] <smb> skip (not that my opinion would matter that much here ) :)
[16:04] <hallyn> skip is fine with me
[16:06] <hallyn> toodles :)
[16:08] <rbasak> OK let's skip.
[16:11] <arosales> rbasak: looks like ubuntu-server meeting was cancelled for today, correct
[16:11] <rbasak> arosales: correct, just before you joined.
[16:17] <arosales> rbasak: ok, thanks. Sorry I joined late :-/

[17:06] <jsalisbury> trijntje, go ahead
[17:06] <trijntje> There is a bug I reported against ubuntu-defaults-builder, where iso builds fail only for quantal 64 bit due to an error configuring the kernel
[17:07] <trijntje> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/+source/ubuntu-defaults-builder/+bug/1075876
[17:07] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1075876 in ubuntu-defaults-builder (Ubuntu Quantal) "ubuntu-defaults-builder: only quantal 64bit does not build" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[17:07] <trijntje> ubuntu-defaults-builder is a project that allows easy creation of localised ubuntu iso's, geared towards a certain geographical region. Customization options are: local radiostations, extra programs (for example, dutch tax return software), custom unity launchers (for example: to popular news sites or the LoCo team webpage), etc.
[17:07] <trijntje> I was hoping someone who knows about the kernel could take a look at it and maybe point me in the right direction
[17:07] <trijntje> ..
[17:08] <jsalisbury> trijntje, sure, I can review it for you and point you to the right person if needed.
[17:08] <jsalisbury> ..
[17:09] <jsalisbury> Any other open discussions?
[17:09] <trijntje> jsalisbury: that would be great! That bug has been sitting there for quite some time, and I don't have the knowhow to investigate it myself.
[17:09] <trijntje> ..
[17:09] <jsalisbury> trijntje, np.  I'll review and update the bug.
[17:09] <jsalisbury> ..
[17:10] <trijntje> jsalisbury: Thanks!
[17:10] <jsalisbury> Thanks everyone
