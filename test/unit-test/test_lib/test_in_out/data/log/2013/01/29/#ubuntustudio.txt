[00:00] <gartral> NoTchTesT: if your looking for just basic, quick edits, clip a bad segment, re-align audio to video, that sort of stuff.. I recommend OpenShot, it's not very featureful, but it's pretty good
[00:03] <NoTchTesT> complete one
[00:04] <NoTchTesT> gartral
[00:07] <gartral> NoTchTesT: take a look at Cinelerra.. it's got a hell of a learning curve, but it's very powerful, if not very "pretty"

[00:15] <FloatingGoat> is there any way to get like 4 rakaracks
[00:15] <FloatingGoat> going
[00:15] <FloatingGoat> and only certain fequencys go to each
[00:15] <FloatingGoat> so I can get tone to midi to play chords
[00:18] <FloatingGoat> lol
[00:45] <Len-nb> Try with jackrack and some filter plugins.
[00:49] <sirriffsalot> Which irc-chat program would you recommend for simple, easy use, minimalistic space-usage and automatically connects to so an so channel?
[00:55] <FloatingGoat> sirriffsalot: quasselll
[00:58] <sirriffsalot> FloatingGoat, thanks! What do you think of the ootb xchat?
[00:58] <sirriffsalot> Ootb in terms of ubuntu studio that is
[00:58] <FloatingGoat> out of the box?
[01:23] <sirriffsalot> FloatingGoat, yeah
[01:23] <FloatingGoat> well i dont know
[01:23] <FloatingGoat> out of the box xchat is very basic, I had to get help on how to do certain things like saving channels and nicks etc
[01:23] <FloatingGoat> quassell just does i
[01:23] <FloatingGoat> it*
[01:24] <FloatingGoat> its very user friendly
[01:25] <sirriffsalot> FloatingGoat, goodie. So what makes you use xchat? If you are
[01:26] <FloatingGoat> Im not using anything
[01:26] <FloatingGoat> but if I were it would be quassell
[01:26] <sirriffsalot> You're just on the web?
[01:26] <sirriffsalot> in the web* is more appropriate perhaps ;D
[01:27] <FloatingGoat> yeah haha
[01:29] <FloatingGoat> ill brb
=== FloatingGoat_ is now known as FloatingGoat
[01:30] <FloatingGoat> there
[01:30] <FloatingGoat> now im good
[01:30] <sirriffsalot> Welcome back
[01:30] <sirriffsalot> Hehe
[01:30] <FloatingGoat> im on quassel now
[01:31] <sirriffsalot> Why haha
[02:14] <FloatingGoat> idk
[02:35] <sirriffsalot> Why does the start menu contain two launchers for Brasero (Video Production and Media Playback)?
[02:50] <xrs> idiot proofing my guess. you can use Main Menu (alacarte) to change that if you wish
[02:53] <tuples> ug, Ladi system tray doesn't seem to like starting a studio when jackd is or was running >.>
[02:58] <tuples> works if I kill jackd though
[02:58] <tuples> which is functional, so I'll take it
[03:17] <Len-nb> sirriffsalot, I think Brassero is on more than one menu because it fits two workflows.
[03:18] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, yeah.. figured as much, felt somehow insulted by it though, hehe
[03:19] <Len-nb> I can inderstand.
[03:20] <Len-nb> There have been a few times though I have installed new software and made 4 or 5 tries looking for the thing in the menu.
[03:21] <Len-nb> tuples, jackd or jackdbus?
[03:22] <Len-nb> Laditray probably is trying to start jackdbus, it can't if jackd is running
[03:22] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, I see. But the same applies to the interminable links to the ubuntu software center in the out of the box ubuntu studio 12.10..
[03:22] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, I mean.. come on?
[03:22] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, they are in every single category! Haha
[03:23] <Len-nb> Each of them shows software relevant to the place where it is.
[03:23] <Len-nb> Even with a DVD sized ISO we can't include all the SW we want people to know about.
[03:23] <sirriffsalot> Really, I did not notice that.. Either way it is a tad bit too much in my opinion. At least I can remove it:)
[03:24] <Len-nb> Not every category, all ours though.
[03:24] <Len-nb> (plus office)
[03:24] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, by the way, if I try to start jackd2 right after login it goes without a hitch, but if I have been using flash, vlc, or something like that, it fails. Is there any script you recommend I run to kill any process(es) that would prevent jackd from starting?
[03:25] <Len-nb> That is a pulseaudio bug. Fix is on the way. Are you using qjackctl to start jack?
[03:26] <Len-nb> (there is a workaround)
[03:26] <sirriffsalot> Qjackctl
[03:26] <sirriffsalot> But I've removed everything pulseaudio.. hehe
[03:26] <sirriffsalot> I stick to alsa
[03:27] <sirriffsalot> Hmm.. I am still seeing a pulseaudio o.O
[03:27] <Len-nb> Then I am not sure. Maybe GS doesn't release the device.
[03:27] <sirriffsalot> How could this be?
[03:27] <sirriffsalot> If I do $ ps -A that is
[03:27] <Len-nb> :)
[03:28] <sirriffsalot> Aaah
[03:28] <sirriffsalot> The gstreamer plugin
[03:29] <Len-nb> If PA is running that is it.
[03:29] <Len-nb> The GS plugin should release as soon as it is finished it's stream
[03:30] <sirriffsalot> Well it's curious.. I've removed the audio server..
[03:30] <sirriffsalot> What the hell..
[03:30] <Len-nb> PA respawns
[03:30] <sirriffsalot> Pulseaudio is installed
[03:30] <sirriffsalot> I removed it!
[03:30] <sirriffsalot> This is spooky
[03:30] <sirriffsalot> I recently did this though http://jackaudio.org/routing_flash
[03:31] <sirriffsalot> Would any of those packages include the re-installation of pulseaudio?
[03:31] <cfhowlett> sirriffsalot, sudo apt-get purge pulseaudio*
[03:31] <sirriffsalot> cfhowlett, yeah.. was considering it. But now that things work as long as I can get jack up and running.. would this create other problems?
[03:33] <Len-nb> sirriffsalot, There is a work around for that problem if you like.
[03:33] <cfhowlett> sirriffsalot, jack calls on PA for quite a few things so I'd think twice before purging/removing
[03:33] <sirriffsalot> Yeah, if I just kill the pulseaudio process I can start jackd
[03:33] <tuples> Len-nb: jackd and jackdbus are running
[03:33] <Lumpy> can't he just kill it in jack?
[03:33] <Lumpy> irc, that is what i did
[03:34] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, what would that be? add the killall pulseaudio -9 command on the start of qjackctl?
[03:34] <tuples> I kill jackd, then start it in ladi with start studio
[03:34] <tuples> which seems to work
[03:35] <tuples> pulse audio configs set jack jack_out and in as default sinks
[03:35] <Len-nb> No. in the second tab there is room for scripts.
[03:35] <Len-nb> the one that runs just before jack starts can be:
[03:36] <Len-nb> pasuspender -- sleep 5 &
[03:36] <Len-nb> Makes pulse give up the port long enough that jack can grab it.
[03:42] <Lumpy> hmm
[03:42] <Lumpy> would that maybe explain why i have issues trying to patch calf plugins into the signalflow when i launch jack?
[03:42] <Lumpy> i don't run any script and simple don't enable the dbus
[03:44] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, would you mind explaining that command in a little more detail?
[03:46] <Len-nb> What part are you missing?
[03:47] <Len-nb> pasuspender tells PA to release all the HW ports while it runs whatever is after the --
[03:47] <Len-nb> sleep 5 runs for 5 sec (1 is enough on my setup)
[03:48] <Len-nb> during that time jackdbus starts and is able to grab the ports it wants.
[03:48] <Len-nb> Then pasuspender quits and pulse tries to grab whatever ports are available
[03:49] <Len-nb> the ports jack has are not available
[03:49] <Len-nb> as soon as jack stops and releases the ports it has pulse grabs them.
[03:51] <Len-nb> Oh, and the & tells pasuspender to run background so jackdbus can start in FG.
[03:54] <Lumpy> len would there be anything i could do to maybe get jack rack and/or calf to work nice with idjc and jack?
[03:54] <Lumpy> anytime i try and run them and patch them in i get all skippy and such
[03:54] <Len-nb> Should just work...
[03:54] <Lumpy> that is what i thought
[03:54] <Len-nb> Hmmm
[03:54] <Lumpy> maybe just my resource deprived machine then
[03:54] <Len-nb> Could be.
[03:55] <Len-nb> Have you watched cpu use with top?
[03:55] <Len-nb> The % in the jack window is just DSP not the whole machine cpu use.
[03:55] <Lumpy> my cpu use is almost always through the roof when i try that sf
[03:55] <Lumpy> not too bad with just jackd and idjc
[03:56] <Lumpy> but as soon as i add jackrack or calf... whamo
[03:56] <Len-nb> What machine?
[03:57] <Lumpy> P4 dual core 2.4 GHz on a waspd65 mobo with 2GB RAM
[03:58] <Lumpy> pretty old
[03:58] <Len-nb> That should work though.
[03:58] <Len-nb> What plugin are you using in jackrack?
[03:58] <Lumpy> i forget the command to check the kernel
[03:58] <Lumpy> i think it is the lowlatency though
[03:59]  * Len-nb has a 10 year old P4 2.4g machine.
[03:59] <Len-nb> uname -a
[03:59] <Lumpy> nope generic kernel
[03:59] <cfhowlett> Len-nb, feel free to upgrade that box any day now!
[04:00] <Len-nb> I have mixed 16 tracks so far with no problem... why spend money?
[04:00] <Lumpy> len, don't recall specifically but was trying compressors
[04:00] <Lumpy> and it didn't seem to matter
[04:00] <Lumpy> any compressor and it did the same with calf
[04:01] <Len-nb> I haven't played with compressors much
[04:01] <Len-nb> Mostly I have done eq, reverb and box emulation.
[04:01] <Lumpy> reverb seems to work just fine
[04:02] <Lumpy> more or less, just looking for a compressor to save a step post processing with the live streams
[04:03] <Lumpy> but not too pressing, the G5 does the post production in about 30% less time
[04:03] <Len-nb> Most of the effects I add are for mixdown not tracking, so I set the latency higher.
[04:04] <Len-nb> (-p 1024)
[04:04] <Lumpy> i use this one with audacity for post production work
[04:04] <Len-nb> I track at -p 64
[04:04] <Lumpy> http://theaudacitytopodcast.com/chriss-dynamic-compressor-plugin-for-audacity/
[04:04] <Lumpy> just don't try the bass boost in it
[04:05] <Len-nb> How could you not use it... OK.
[04:06] <Lumpy> the developer is no more and, as of the last release, the bass boost was experimental
[04:06] <Len-nb> kids to bed brb
[04:12] <Len-nb> what latency are you using?
[04:12] <Len-nb> (in jack)
[04:13] <Lumpy> whatever the default is
[04:13] <Lumpy> i end up with 46.4 msec according to jackqt
[04:13] <Len-nb> I think 1024... sounds bout right
[04:13] <Lumpy> yup
[04:13] <Lumpy> just opened it
[04:13] <Lumpy> that is frames/period
[04:14] <Len-nb> Yes
[04:14] <Lumpy> realtime enabled
[04:14] <Len-nb> does jack tell you it actually started RT?
[04:15]  * Len-nb doesn't remember if jack can start RT with a generic kernel or not.
[04:15] <Lumpy> JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 10
[04:15] <Lumpy> Jack: Create non RT thread
[04:16] <sirriffsalot> Len-nb, sounds reasonable :) thanks for explaining!
[04:17] <Lumpy> sirriffsalot: len rawks don't he
[04:17] <Len-nb>  JACK server starting in realtime mode with priority 77 is what I get
[04:17] <Len-nb> Np
[04:17] <Len-nb> Hope it helps.
[04:18] <sirriffsalot> Lumpy, haven't heard his music, if any, but he sure is helpful and thorough :)
[04:18] <Lumpy> well i haven't heard his music either
[04:18] <Len-nb> Mostly quiet.
[04:18] <Lumpy> but thanks to him and others here
[04:18] <Lumpy> people can hear my stream
[04:18] <Lumpy> :)
[04:18] <Len-nb> The last bit I did had no drums even.
[04:19] <Len-nb> I am i bit more rowdy on stage though.
[04:21] <Len-nb> I enjoy the interaction between players and audience.
[04:21] <Len-nb> I find it hard to translate that to studio.
[04:24] <Lumpy> maybe i just didn't try the right compressor
[04:26] <Lumpy> jack says it is rolling in RT
[04:27] <Lumpy> i dunno len... seems fine now
[04:28] <Lumpy> running jackrack, two meterbridge, idjc, and only at 22%
[04:28] <Len-nb> Are you running pulse bridged in?
[04:29] <Lumpy> running calf compressor LADSPA, tried SC4, SC3 at different times during this chat and the most i have hit is 26 %
[04:29] <Lumpy> no
[04:29] <Len-nb> Or any audio from pulse?
[04:29] <Lumpy> i haven't tried that since holstein and you suggested killing it via dbus
[04:30] <Lumpy> i have no idea what i am doing different than on the previous attempts
[04:30] <Len-nb> OK, how are you adding ... I have forgotten whats called again
[04:30] <Len-nb> the program you use instead of skype
[04:30] <Lumpy> that wouldn't be it
[04:30] <Lumpy> it is teamspeak 3
[04:31] <Lumpy> and i pull that in via another machine through my eternal mixer
[04:31] <Len-nb> ya that. I wouldn't think it would be just whatever you use to get into jack.
[04:31] <Lumpy> so as far as sf goes it is just line in
[04:31] <Len-nb> Ah.
[04:31] <Lumpy> although i would like to get that patched in as voip eventually
[04:31] <Len-nb> Good way to save cpu.
[04:32] <Lumpy> also is there any way to get jackdmp anymore?
[04:32] <Lumpy> or jack2
[04:32] <Lumpy> something for multiprocessors?
[04:32] <Len-nb> jack2 = jackdmp
[04:32] <Len-nb> jack2 uses one thread for audio and two more for other things.
[04:33] <Lumpy> cpu went up to 32% when i connected to the stream but that is still nothing significant
[04:34] <Lumpy> nice to see it can work but i sure would like to know why it didn't on the previous two attempts
[04:34] <Lumpy> no xruns or anything this time
[04:34]  * Lumpy turns on logging
[04:35] <Lumpy> the DSP load isn't even 10 %
[04:36] <Lumpy> 0 xruns in 15 minutes of rolling (not all of those minutes connected to the stream)
[04:36] <Lumpy> not that being connected to the stream should really matter
[04:36] <Lumpy> it is behaving nothing like it did on my last two attempts
[04:37] <Len-nb> I'm less than 20% Streaming your audio from internet->audacious->pulse->jack->compressor-jack out.
[04:38] <Len-nb> latency 16ms
[04:39] <Len-nb> atom powered netbook running at 800mhz most of the time.
[04:39] <Lumpy> 6.34 msec according to status here
[04:39] <Lumpy> i am not connected to the remote server but that should be mute
[04:40] <Len-nb> my internal sound interface can't go that low.
[04:40] <Len-nb> -p128 is as low as jack will start.
[04:40] <Lumpy> i am going line in --> meterbridge -->jackrack --> meterbridge--> idjc
[04:41] <Lumpy> and i am using a SB live PCI for my card
[04:42] <Lumpy> i dunno
[04:42] <Lumpy> it seems just fine now
[04:43] <Lumpy> maybe it knows when i am live.. heh
[04:44] <Lumpy> and looking at the meters, listening through the cans, the compressor is deffinitely working
[04:45] <Lumpy> looks like you solve another problem for me len
[04:45] <Lumpy> how did you do that?
[04:46] <Len-nb> haven't the faintest.
[04:46] <Lumpy> how do i save this as a session?
[04:46] <Lumpy> i never did figure that one out yet
[04:47] <Lumpy> i never wanted another compressor until they changed idjc around
[04:47] <Len-nb> I have never been that good with sessions either
[04:49] <Len-nb> I am surprised IDJC doesn't support plugins natively.
[04:50] <Len-nb> I guess they feel they don't need to with all the stuff jack supports.
[04:50] <Lumpy> it had compression in some of the older builds
[04:50] <Lumpy> a nice one actually
[04:51] <Lumpy> i think i might use patchage to save the setup
[04:51] <Lumpy> it is all there nice and perty when i launch it
[04:52] <Len-nb> Sounds good.
[04:52] <Lumpy> that might not work either though
[04:52] <Lumpy> with the way meter bridge launches
[04:53] <Lumpy> but it will give me a nice schematic
[04:53] <Lumpy> oh boy... now i am getting excited
[04:53] <Lumpy> if i can keep the load this low
[04:54] <Len-nb> jack.plumbing might work.
[04:54] <Lumpy> i can pull my DX7 and DR5 into it
[04:54] <Lumpy> never heard of jack.plumbing
[04:54] <Lumpy> is that in by default or do i need to add it
[04:54] <Len-nb> jack.plumbing comes with jack.tools.
[04:54] <Len-nb> have to add it.
[04:55] <Lumpy> my GF is going to kill you len.. since you fixed this you know i am not going to bed anytime soon
[04:55] <Lumpy> :P
[04:55] <Len-nb> it runs as a deamon and connects things according to a rules file.
[04:56] <Len-nb> uses regular expressions for matching.
[04:56] <Lumpy> synaptic or terminal to add
[04:57] <Len-nb> either... sudo apt-get install jack.tools
[04:57] <Len-nb> I figured it must be getting late over there.
[04:57] <Lumpy> she is already passed out
[04:58] <Lumpy> she didn't make it through the news even
[04:58] <Len-nb> after midnight....
[04:58] <Lumpy> she had her hand amputated and suffers bad from phantom pains
[04:58] <Lumpy> she was having a bad night tonight
[04:58] <Lumpy> 1 am in two minutes
[04:58] <Len-nb> I have heard of that.
[04:59] <Lumpy> installing tools via synaptic
[04:59] <Len-nb> My Yf is taking nursing right now sees a lot of things.
[05:00] <Lumpy> i was a medic.. i saw more than enough
[05:00] <Len-nb> She has been doing volunteer at the hospital for years
[05:00] <Len-nb> I can imagine
[05:01] <Lumpy> wait, you have autotune in studio now?
[05:01]  * Lumpy is gonna be a singer now.. heh
[05:01] <Lumpy> so how do i launch tools?
[05:01] <Len-nb> For about three releases at least
[05:01] <Len-nb> tools are all commandline.
[05:02] <Len-nb> type jack. and then hit tab for a list
[05:02] <Lumpy> well that is one of the down sides of studio... all the menus, you can just miss stuff
[05:02] <Lumpy> not a complaint, just sayin
[05:02] <Len-nb> I agree though.
[05:03] <Len-nb> Just think, without qjackctl, jack itself is CLI too.
[05:03] <Lumpy> nice... what is .dl, and .udp
[05:03] <Len-nb> .udp doesn't work well use netjack instead
[05:04] <Len-nb> dl dsp loader
[05:04] <Lumpy> i am giong to have to read up on these tools a bit
[05:04] <Len-nb> man jack.dl
[05:04] <Lumpy> looks like i need to create a config file or two before i can run plumbing
[05:04] <Len-nb> yes.
[05:04] <Len-nb> maybe another day...   ;)
[05:05] <Lumpy> yeah, i will likely bork it if i try it in my current state
[05:05] <Lumpy> but, this looks like the exact ticket i want
[05:06] <Lumpy> i am going to put a postit on the monitor (screen) to remember to export my package list
[05:07] <Lumpy> looking at the man for plumbing though
[05:07] <Len-nb> if you look at https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntustudio-dev/ubuntu-seeds/ubuntustudio.raring
[05:07] <Len-nb> it will show you what we add on purpose.
[05:08] <Len-nb> Some of those things pull in other packages we don't expect.
[05:08] <Lumpy> the only thing that i see as any type of challenge would be the way meter bridge names each meter by it's process
[05:08] <Lumpy> but i am sure that is not much of a challenge
[05:09] <Len-nb> That is what regular expesions are for.
[05:10] <Len-nb> they allow you to spec a part of the name instead of all of it.
[05:10] <Lumpy> yeah but i am running two instances
[05:10] <Lumpy> the only way i tell em apart is by PID
[05:10] <Len-nb> use meterbridge -n first
[05:10] <Len-nb> and -n second
[05:11] <Len-nb> type meterbridge --help
[05:11]  * Lumpy puts n00b hat on
[05:11] <Lumpy> i wonder if i can do the same in idjc
[05:11] <Len-nb> (invalid but it prints usage anyway.)
[05:12] <Len-nb> man meterbridge works too
[05:13] <Lumpy> i just discovered that myself
[05:13] <Lumpy> isn't cli a lovely thing?
[05:13] <Lumpy> and i already answered another quesiton i was going to ask
[05:13]  * Len-nb started linux on slackware .8 or so al cli
[05:13] <Lumpy> i used to have a tshirt that said real hackers don't use mice
[05:14] <Lumpy> i still have one somewhere that says i void warrneties
[05:14] <Lumpy> wth is a jellyfish phase meter?
[05:14] <Len-nb> ??
[05:15] <Lumpy> one of the meterbridge options
[05:15] <Lumpy> and if meterbridge can do ppm why did i install jmeter
[05:15] <Lumpy> or wait did i on this machine
[05:15] <Len-nb> ys but ?? anyway, IDK
[05:17] <Len-nb> Does -c 4 give 4 meters?
[05:18] <Lumpy> i am missing something when i type the command
[05:18] <Lumpy> type literally what you want me to try
[05:19] <Lumpy> or maybe we have to define each meter in the column
[05:21] <Len-nb> Ya, the default command line is:
[05:21] <Len-nb> /usr/bin/meterbridge -t vu alsa_pcm:playback_1 alsa_pcm:playback_2
[05:22] <Lumpy> nice
[05:22] <Lumpy> real totally awesome nice!
[05:22] <Lumpy> i almost shouted loud enough to wake the kid and GF
[05:23] <Len-nb> so if you were to spec the the connections you wanted on the command line it should connect on start
[05:23] <Len-nb> Start with that number of meters
[05:24] <Len-nb> -c 2 would put 4 meters in two columns of two meters I think
[05:26] <Lumpy> len you rawk
[05:26] <Lumpy> thank you so much
[05:26] <Lumpy> and i can start it with ppm
[05:27] <Lumpy> so if i get the plumbing set up right... it would not take much to do a script shortcut right on the desktop to launch the entire kit and kaboodle
[05:28] <Lumpy> i bet ya i could launch idjc, meters, jack and even the folders i use to pull audio files from all in one shot
[05:30] <Lumpy> and you are dead on with the -c
[05:30] <Len-nb> try meterbridge -c 2 -t vu -n mybridge alsa_pcm:playback_1 alsacm:playback_2 alsa_pcm:playback_3 alsa_pcm:playback_4
[05:30] <Len-nb> you prolly have
[05:30] <Lumpy> and so long as i set the plumbing up right, it would solve any PID issues and have the meters set where i want em
[05:32] <Lumpy> nicer yet
[05:32] <Lumpy> you really want me to shout and wake the kid eh?
[05:32] <Lumpy> :P
[05:32] <Len-nb> ;-)
[05:33] <Len-nb> On linux audio user there are a couple of blind guys who record music all CLI
[05:33] <Len-nb> They use nama
[05:34] <Len-nb> (LAU is a mailing list)
[05:34] <Lumpy> how do i sign up for that one
[05:34] <Len-nb> I have learnt a lot from LAU
[05:35] <Lumpy> i get a few audacity centric mailing list ones
[05:36] <Lumpy> you know, if i brush up on the cli, i bet you it would be pretty simple to launch everything, on the right workspace even, with one shell script
[05:36] <Len-nb> http://lists.linuxaudio.org/listinfo/linux-audio-user
[05:37] <Len-nb> I don't know if xfce is good with doing the workspace thing. xvwm (I think) does
[05:38] <Lumpy> i have had no issues with the workspaces in xfce
[05:39] <Len-nb> I don't know if you can set up for certain apps to start in certain workspaces
[05:39] <Lumpy> i usually launch the jack stuff on one, set the meters to always on top and always on visble, and idjc and folders on another (I have two screens per workspace and four workspaces total)
[05:39] <Lumpy> well that would be easy enough to work about,
[05:39] <Lumpy> just do two short cuts
[05:39] <Lumpy> launch one
[05:40] <Lumpy> switch workspaces, and launch the second
[05:40] <Lumpy> as long as the first one launches jackd
[05:40] <Len-nb> fvwm (not xvwm) lets you default an app to always start in one workspace.
[05:40] <Lumpy> it should be seamless
[05:40] <Len-nb> Ya.
[05:41] <Lumpy> is fvwm installed with studio by default
[05:41] <Len-nb> No, fvwm is old school.
[05:41] <Lumpy> i have been autolaunching xfce since the day after i installed this 12.04 build
[05:42] <Lumpy> kk
[05:42] <Len-nb>  before the first kde or gnome.
[05:42] <Lumpy> so if i installed it would it show as one of the options in the menu
[05:42] <Lumpy> wait is that what fedora uses?
[05:43] <Len-nb> There is still active development on fvwm. But I don't know if it would even see the system menu.
[05:43] <Len-nb> fedora prolly uses kde.
[05:43] <Lumpy> well i could still launch into terminal and just launch it there though
[05:43] <Lumpy> that is one of the nice things about nix
[05:43] <Lumpy> you can really tweak it
[05:43] <Lumpy> i haven't used fedora in ages
[05:44] <Lumpy> nor slackware for that matter
[05:44] <Len-nb> I never really wormed up to redhat.
[05:44] <Lumpy> currently i use mint, debian, lubuntu, xubuntu, tango and studio
[05:44] <Len-nb> I ran slackware from .8 to 12
[05:45] <Lumpy> i think 9 is about where i left slack
[05:45] <Lumpy> and no, i did not care for redhat or BSD much
[05:45] <Lumpy> but they are great for servers
[05:46] <Len-nb> I was running SW on my server, but it is now ubuntu.
[05:46] <Lumpy> the only time i ever played with BSD was for a server in fact, for a church i attended
[05:46] <Lumpy> i like ubuntu server, though i still get lost in it because, until october, we used centos
[05:46] <Len-nb> our church doesn't do much with the internet
[05:47] <Len-nb> The pastor is facebook happy :P
[05:47]  * Len-nb doesn't use facebook
[05:47] <Lumpy> so even with us opening and closing and opening and closing all those meters
[05:48] <Lumpy> opening and closing all those compressors
[05:48] <Lumpy> 1 hour and 27 minutes rolling
[05:48] <Lumpy> 4 xruns total
[05:48] <Len-nb> I have more than that
[05:48] <Lumpy> the largest .095 msec
[05:49]  * Lumpy would still like to know what we fixed
[05:49] <Len-nb> My wireless gives me about 1 xrun per minute
[05:50] <Len-nb> If I unload the kernel module for my wireless I have no xruns.
[05:50] <Len-nb> No internet or chat either :)
[05:51] <Lumpy> if i load the nvidia kernel, which i don't think we can anymore, i would have gobs and gobs of em
[05:51] <Len-nb> Gotts go, time to spend time with my wife.   :D
[05:51] <Lumpy> but arandr seems to work just fine without em anymore
[05:51] <Lumpy> i gotta get some sleep but i will let you know how this works out
[05:52] <Len-nb> thanks
[05:52] <Lumpy> from what i see it is going to be great
[05:52] <Len-nb> bye
[05:52] <Lumpy> thanks

[06:14] <SomeGuy_> How do I change the system wide fixed width font in Ubuntu Studio and why is this not made ridiculously obvious in the GUI?
[06:15] <SomeGuy_> googled this all over
[06:15] <SomeGuy_> i can change the font for some things in Appearance but not the system wide fixed width font
[06:16] <SomeGuy_> need to increase font size so i can read the terminal
[06:16] <cfhowlett> Settings manager > appearance > fonts
[06:16] <SomeGuy_> cfhowlett, no, that does not change the system wide fixed width font
[06:16] <SomeGuy_> that only changes the font in the xfce gui
[06:17] <cfhowlett> ah.  OK.  sorry, then IDK.  I bet the #xfce folks know
[06:17] <SomeGuy_> I need to change the system wide fixed width font that terminal and the window titles (whatever they're called in linux) use
[06:17] <SomeGuy_> oh good idea
[06:17] <cfhowlett> or #xubuntu
[06:19] <zequence> SomeGuy_: I think you might need a gnome tool for that
[06:19] <zequence> SomeGuy_: gnome-tweak-tool
[06:19] <zequence> Try it. not sure if it'll work
[06:20] <SomeGuy_> zequence, i tried that
[06:20] <SomeGuy_> doesn't change things in xfce
[06:20] <zequence> Then it's XFCE specific somehow
[06:20] <zequence> You might find someone who knows at either #xfce or #xubuntu
[06:20] <cfhowlett> SomeGuy_, gnome tweak for xfce?  doesn't sound legit ...
[06:22] <zequence> SomeGuy_: If you find out how, could you just mention that to us?
[06:22] <zequence> I'm going to make that a task for us to find out anyway
[06:24] <SomeGuy_> i found another font setting in settings manager > window manager > fonts
[06:25] <cfhowlett> SomeGuy_, http://maketecheasier.com/change-console-fonts-in-ubuntu/2012/03/05
[06:25] <SomeGuy_> you can make the font bigger for the window titles, but you can't make the window titles any taller to accomidate the bigger letters
[06:28] <SomeGuy_> oh. looks like i just needed to choose a font other than "fixed"
[06:28] <SomeGuy_> i chose terminus bold. will see how it looks on reboot. thanks guys
[06:31] <SomeGuy_> nope that didn't change a thing
[06:32] <SomeGuy_> can't solve it tonight. too late too tired. but its a major annoyance when you are visually  impaired to have to deal with such tiny fonts
[06:33] <cfhowlett> errr.  he left.  I wondered whether a solution might be found in the "Access" settings
[06:33] <cfhowlett> just looked.  Not there.
[08:13] <ubuntu-studio> hello
[08:14] <cfhowlett> ubuntu-studio, greetings
[08:15] <ubuntu-studio> cfhowlett, do you know a thing or two about the DAW Ardour
[08:16] <ubuntu-studio> Especially the drum machine, is what I am trying to access
[08:35] <ubuntu-studio> keen sense of smell...
[11:54] <btdhero> hi
[11:54] <btdhero> anybody here?
[11:54] <btdhero> i need some help
[11:55] <zequence-w> btdhero, Just ask
[11:55] <Lump|AFK> morning btdhero
[11:55] <btdhero> a friend of mine recommended me the ubuntu studio software
[11:55] <Lump|AFK> good recomendation imho
[11:56] <btdhero> but i would like to know if this is the right choice for my need
[11:56] <btdhero> I want to record an orchestra
[11:56] <btdhero> performing at acoustic instruments
[11:57] <Lump|AFK> and you want to use a computer as the recording device?
[11:57] <btdhero> a laptop, yeap
[11:57] <btdhero> I have 2 microphones, and some hardware
[11:57] <Lump|AFK> imho, your limitations are not going to be the OS but your soundcard and mics
[11:57] <zequence-w> Exactly right
[11:58] <Lump|AFK> but imho, ubuntu studio is likely a great choice for the post production end of things
[11:58] <Lump|AFK> what hardware and what mics please
[11:58] <zequence-w> You need to make sure you have an audio device that has the specs you require, and that it is supported by Linux. And, of course, good mics
[11:58] <btdhero> i don't know much about this, so would you be kind and explain me a few things ?
[11:58] <Lump|AFK> what kind of budget do you have for this project btdhero ?
[11:59] <btdhero> uhmm, a few hundreds €, let's say ...
[11:59] <btdhero> although, i will record one day, and never after
[11:59] <btdhero> so ...
[12:00] <Lump|AFK> okay, so what do you mean by "have some hardware"?
[12:00] <Lump|AFK> brb time to wakey wakey the kid and GF
[12:00] <btdhero> i'll wait
[12:01] <Lump|AFK> kk, back for about 10
[12:01] <Lump|AFK> then i will be in and out
[12:02] <Lump|AFK> okay btdhero, here is the deal
[12:02] <Lump|AFK> you want to be able to record, as a rule of thumb, at twice the sample rate of the highest frequency you wish to capture
[12:03] <Lump|AFK> you mentioned orchestra, so that would likely mean you have some high pitched string instruments like violins
[12:03] <btdhero> yeap
[12:03] <Lump|AFK> so that would mean a pretty high sample rate
[12:03] <Lump|AFK> so your first check should be your soundcard and/or recording device
[12:04] <Lump|AFK> as in what are those specs
[12:04] <Lump|AFK> then the next thing you would have to consider would be the mics
[12:04] <Lump|AFK> being an orchestra, i would suggest condensers
[12:04] <btdhero> what means a 'pretty high sample rate' ? :-/
[12:06] <btdhero> i need linux again, i have douzins of windows open :|
[12:06] <Lump|AFK> well when i do orchestras, i go as high as my zoom H2 will go
[12:06] <Lump|AFK> which i think is 96KHz 24bit
[12:07] <btdhero> ok, i will note those
[12:07] <Lump|AFK> i also have a H$ which does not have the same rates so i get confused sometimes
[12:07] <Lump|AFK> and, many would argue, that I sample at too high a rate
[12:08] <Lump|AFK> however, if you start fat, you can take it down later
[12:08] <Lump|AFK> if you start thin, you can not take it up later
[12:08] <Lump|AFK> so i would rather spend some extra time in post production and have all those violing harmonics rather than wish i had them later and not be able to get to them
[12:10] <btdhero> post production = work in ubuntu studio, i guess
[12:10] <Lump|AFK> yeah
[12:10] <Lump|AFK> that would be any editing or resampleing
[12:10] <Lump|AFK> and the os is perfect for that imho
[12:11] <btdhero> is it hard to learn how to handle the OS ?
[12:11] <Lump|AFK> in my opinion, not at all
[12:11] <Lump|AFK> it is all gui these days
[12:12] <btdhero> I guess i'll find some tutorials, first
[12:12] <Lump|AFK> there is really very little need for command line type of stuff unless you are doing something a tad specialized
[12:14] <Lump|AFK> i don't think you will even need that much in lines of tutorials
[12:15] <btdhero> well, i'm trying to keep it as simple as possible, because I don't have any experience in this domain yet
[12:15] <Lump|AFK> zequence: what are your thoughts?
[12:15] <Lump|AFK> mine would be record it, and use audacity
[12:15] <btdhero> I have used before audacity
[12:15] <Lump|AFK> and btdhero what do you want to do once you record it?
[12:16] <Lump|AFK> simply share a compressed file, maybe burn it to CDA?
[12:16] <Lump|AFK> right?
[12:16] <btdhero> play the music on festivals
[12:16] <btdhero> I must leave, i'll be back later
[12:16] <Lump|AFK> so, more or less, you just want a recording, maybe you would want to eq it a bit or such
[12:16] <Lump|AFK> kk
[12:16] <Lump|AFK> i have to help get the kid ready for school
=== btdhero is now known as btdhero|brb
[12:16] <Lump|AFK> i will be hereish
[12:17] <Lump|AFK> i was tempted to suggest he just buy a zoom or similar device but to record only once?
[12:18] <Lump|AFK> they are cheap enough these days but still..
[12:18] <Lump|AFK> anyhow bbl
[12:26] <zequence-w> btdhero|brb, I suggest renting the gear. Especially good mics cost a lot
[12:27] <zequence-w> Using mics is more of a sound engineering problem
[12:27] <zequence-w> There are many stereo sound usb audio devices that work with Linux, however not many have full support
[12:28] <zequence-w> btdhero|brb, Here's a page to look for audio devices
[12:28] <zequence-w> Look under usb
[12:29] <zequence-w> Find one that seems good. Rent it, and the mics at some music store. Also, you need micstands
[12:29] <zequence-w> I'm thinking you want to do a stereo recording
[12:29] <zequence-w> You might need extra big mic stands
[12:30] <zequence-w> A classic method is to put the mics at 90 angle, very close to each other. This is a sure way of getting a succesful recording
[12:30] <Lump|AFK> the zooms have them built in like that
[12:31] <Lump|AFK> and, based on my experience, they work great for that
[12:31] <zequence-w> They should be fairly close (not the other end of the room), but positioned so that they can pick the whole orchestra. Not just a part of it
[12:32] <Lump|AFK> the only down side of the zooms is they eat batteries like zombies eat brains
[12:32] <zequence-w> btdhero|brb, You need condenser mics, so preferably you get ok mic pre amplifiers with phantom power
[12:32] <zequence-w> If you don't get extra pre amps, don't waste too much money on the mics either. You'll still need condenser mics, and at least phantom power on the audio device
[12:32] <Lump|AFK> bbiab.. time to take the puppies out
[12:33] <zequence-w> btdhero|brb, Sorry. Here's the link for the audio devices http://wiki.linuxmusicians.com/doku.php?id=hardware_matrix
[12:34] <Lump|AFK> have you ever used anything like the zooms zequence ?
[12:34] <zequence-w> Lump|AFK, You mean like this http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4/
[12:35] <zequence-w> No. Looks like it could work, yes
[12:35] <Lump|AFK> i don't even have to look at the link yeah
[12:35] <Lump|AFK> i have the h2 and h4n
[12:35] <Lump|AFK> the h4n will drive condensers
[12:35] <Lump|AFK> they both have them built in as well
[12:36] <Lump|AFK> brb i need to deal with these 4 legged guys before i have a floor to mop
[12:40] <Lump|AFK> back
=== btdhero|brb is now known as btdhero
[12:40] <btdhero> a few moments to read ^
[12:41] <Lump|AFK> and the H2 will work with linux
[12:41] <Lump|AFK> i have used it via jack and alsa with both idjc and audacity in the past
[12:41] <Lump|AFK> i also see the h4 is listed
[12:42] <Lump|AFK> i also think that zequence is dead on with the xy mic idea
[12:43] <Lump|AFK> maybe, if the room is shallow, go 120 and not 90 but deffinitely use an xy arrangement
[12:45] <btdhero> we should talk about the room too, ofcourse, but first, what mics do you finaly suggest? renting condenser mics would be the best idea?
[12:47] <Lump|AFK> if I were going to do a concert like that, I would just use the built ins in my H@ and H4
[12:47] <Lump|AFK> er H2
[12:48] <Lump|AFK> i might take extra mics for the H4 because it is a four track and I could get redundancy
[12:48] <Lump|AFK> but if you are going to rent, you may wish to consider a stand alone set up like the H2 or H4
[12:48] <Lump|AFK> not that you have to stick with the zoom brand
[12:49] <Lump|AFK> there are other similar devices
[12:49] <btdhero> ok now, you got me a little confused... H@, H2, H4 >
[12:49] <Lump|AFK> disregard the H@
[12:49] <Lump|AFK> that was a typo
[12:49] <Lump|AFK> the H@ and H4 are portable recording devices
[12:50] <Lump|AFK> they have built in mics, set to either 90 or 120 XY configurations and they record in a number of formats right to a SD card
[12:51] <Lump|AFK> in other words, you would not even need your laptop to be there for the recording
[12:51] <Lump|AFK> the devices can record stand along
[12:51] <Lump|AFK> er alone
[12:52] <btdhero> vety nice
[12:52] <btdhero> very *
[12:53] <btdhero> could you give me an example of which would be a proper one ?
[12:53] <btdhero> i am searching in that link
[12:54] <Lump|AFK> the H2 would work just fine for you application in my humble opinion
[12:54] <Lump|AFK> zequence concurred that it would work above as well
[12:54] <Lump|AFK> and, for what it is worth, Tony D'Amico was impressed with my H2
[12:54] <Lump|AFK> and i think he has 6 emmys
[12:55] <Lump|AFK> i was lucky enough to meet him at a focus group and happened to have the device with me
[12:55] <Lump|AFK> the H4 is listed in that link not the H2
[12:56] <Lump|AFK> but if you use the device as a stand alone
[12:56] <Lump|AFK> you just pull the SD card and use a reader
[12:56] <Lump|AFK> it won't matter at all for it would just show up like a usb drive
[13:02] <Lump|AFK> read up btdhero and if you have Qs hollar at me
[13:02] <Lump|AFK> i will be hereish
[13:03]  * Lump|AFK is working atm
[13:03] <btdhero> which one is the H2 ? :-/
[13:04] <btdhero> this one would be the H4, i guess http://www.zoom.co.jp/english/products/h4/
[13:04] <Lump|AFK> it is not listed in that link
[13:04] <Lump|AFK> http://www.samsontech.com/zoom/products/handheld-audio-recorders/h2/
[13:04] <Lump|AFK> it works though
[13:05] <Lump|AFK> i have used it
[13:05] <btdhero> thx, i'll read
[13:15] <Lump|AFK> where abouts are you at btdhero ?
[13:16] <btdhero> i am now getting the 90 and the 120 degrees pattern
[13:16] <btdhero> which one would be better and for how many instruments ?
[13:17] <Lump|AFK> the number of instruments is not the factor
[13:17] <Lump|AFK> the factor is how deep the room is
[13:17] <Lump|AFK> if you are in the back of the room and a 90 pan catches the whole orchestra, that is what you use
[13:17] <Lump|AFK> if your room is not as deep, you may need 120
[13:18] <Lump|AFK> in my case, i would use the 120 if i were recording a rock band in a small tavern
[13:18] <Lump|AFK> if i were at severence hall, i would use the 90
[13:18] <Lump|AFK> the trick is to capture the whole orchestra
[13:19] <Lump|AFK> you can simply bend a wire hanger at 90 and 120 to use as a guage to decide if you are not comfortable just using your eyes
[13:19] <Lump|AFK> but it is really that simple
[13:20] <Lump|AFK> the thing to worry about is levels... there is no forgiveness with digital
[13:21] <Lump|AFK> make sure you don't peak your levels or you will have noise
[13:21] <cfhowlett> sudo hangar-measure?
[13:22] <Lump|AFK> heya cfhowlett
[13:22] <Lump|AFK> trying to explain XY mic and failing i guess
[13:23] <Lump|AFK> btdhero: what matters is that the arc you create with either the 90 or 120 should have the entire orchestra in it
[13:23] <Lump|AFK> how is cfhowlett doing today
[13:23]  * Lump|AFK needs a few more cups of black stuff
[13:24] <cfhowlett> Lump|AFK, suffering tech lust: zoom IQ5 for the ipod/iphone is sweeeet!  (for podcasting purposes)
[13:25] <Lump|AFK> wow that does look sweet
[13:25] <Lump|AFK> i would need an iphone first though
[13:25] <cfhowlett> works on ipad/mini/ipod/iphone ...
[13:25] <Lump|AFK> and since i have an H2 and H4 already, i don't think i will throw the iphone into the budget
[13:26] <cfhowlett> oh, hey you've got the full meal deal.  I just want something ultra mobile but effective.  I'm in China and need to travel light and unobtrusively
[13:27] <Lump|AFK> that is slick
[13:27] <Lump|AFK> my GF already said she wants one
[13:27] <btdhero> the thing is... for now i have a huge room, but with awful acoustics... everything hears wrong in there. I have smaller rooms too, but does it matters the size of the room? how does it affects the audio quality?
[13:28] <contrapunctus> btdhero, of course it does man.
[13:28] <Lump|AFK> yes room size and dimensions do matter much
[13:29] <contrapunctus> btdhero - Have a read through this - http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html
[13:29] <btdhero> oh, thx
[13:29] <Lump|AFK> nice link
[13:29]  * Lump|AFK adds the link to his diigo
=== Lump|AFK is now known as Lumpy
[13:31]  * Lumpy harasses the local restaurants for egg cartons on a regular basis
[13:32] <Lumpy> i layer them between different thicknesses of cardboard to block out noise coming from the windows
[13:32] <Lumpy> it works pretty well actually, i don't hear the trains in my podcasts anymore
[13:33] <btdhero> or, I could record at night. I live at the country side.
[13:33] <contrapunctus> LOL Lumpy
[13:33] <contrapunctus> Sounds pretty sweet though.
[13:33] <contrapunctus> How much noise do you manage to block out like that?
[13:34] <contrapunctus> I wanna treat my room too...it's situated at the corner of a building, and whenever there's a frickin' wedding party out here, my room gets the worst of it, somehow.
[13:34] <Lumpy> well i use dynamic mics for monologue
[13:34] <contrapunctus> I'm recording classical guitar o.o
[13:35] <Lumpy> that helps but the layers of egg cartons,styrofoam and cardboard are about 1 foot thick
[13:35] <Lumpy> so, actually, it blocks a good bit
[13:35] <Lumpy> looks ugly as hades but it works
[13:36] <Lumpy> but for classical guitar, i would not consider dynamics
[13:36] <cfhowlett> I still like the idea of recording in a well stocked closet.  Of course, if you wardrobe is thin or you don't have a suitably portable setup, this is problematic ...
[13:36] <Lumpy> i have also had good luck with the behinger crystal dynamics for live stuff but only rock and roll
[13:37] <Lumpy> i want to get a bunch of those fright elevator pads
[13:37] <Lumpy> those can turn any room into a good closet
[13:37] <Lumpy> you know the ones they hang on the walls to stop you from beating them up
[13:38] <contrapunctus> ugly as Hades LOL
[13:38] <Lumpy> in the past i have lined small rooms with matresses and couch cushions
[13:38] <Lumpy> also ugly but... it does work
[13:38] <contrapunctus> freight elevator pads?
[13:39] <contrapunctus> I'm considering doing that, Lumpy...lining the room with mattresses and couch cushions.
[13:39] <cfhowlett> maybe some surplus space shuttle heat tiles can be found ...
[13:39] <Lumpy> the trick with isolation techs like that you need to vary the thickness
[13:39] <Lumpy> and the materials
[13:39] <Lumpy> you are not blocking the sound so to speak but bouncing it and letting it kill itself
[13:40] <Lumpy> i dunno how well those space shuttle tiles would work for sound
[13:40] <Lumpy> i can ask my fraternity brother about it though
[13:40] <Lumpy> heh
[13:41] <Lumpy> ironically, one of the guys i went to college with is the director of their advanced exploration system division
[13:41] <Lumpy> like what are the odds of that
[13:42] <cfhowlett> niiiiiiiiice!
[13:42] <Lumpy> i was just teasing him the other day... telling him he could send all that unused shuttle stuff my way
[13:42] <Lumpy> so if i end up with any of those tiles.. heh
[13:44] <btdhero> so, the H2 uses a SD card to record the data. It could record directly to the PC, also ?
[13:44] <contrapunctus> the problem is
[13:44] <Lumpy> yes it could
[13:45] <contrapunctus> won't treatment make the room heat up?
[13:45] <Lumpy> it can work either way btdhero
[13:45] <btdhero> and ... should I use here the ubuntu studio software?
[13:47] <btdhero> in order to do the post processing work
[13:47] <Lumpy> well i don't plan on launching the studio and re-entrering the atmophere so i think i will be okay contrapunctus
[13:47] <Lumpy> btdhero: ubuntu studio would be great for post processing
[13:47] <contrapunctus> lol Lumpy
[13:47] <Lumpy> if you would even need any
[13:48] <contrapunctus> Lumpy, what's the hottest your area gets in the whole year?
[13:48] <Lumpy> for orchestras, all i do is use the built in low cut on the zooms (in case i get any vibration off the mic stand) sandbag the mic stand and maybe some eq after the fact
[13:49] <Lumpy> more often than not, all i do is convert it to what ever audio format the end user wants
[13:49] <btdhero> ok, now I got it. it's way simpler than i thought.
[13:50] <Lumpy> exactly
[13:50] <Lumpy> think KISS acro
[13:54] <Lumpy> that is part of the beuaty of the XY
[13:54] <Lumpy> simple and effective
[13:56] <Lumpy> some of the best orchestral recordings i ever heard were done like this
[13:56] <Lumpy> http://www.telarc.com/About/MinimalMiking.aspx
[13:57] <Lumpy> less == more :)
[14:00] <Lumpy> i am going to miss telarc
[14:00] <Lumpy> so does it make sense now btdhero ?
[14:02] <btdhero> yeap, I understood the main things
[14:03] <btdhero> i was reading the acoustics article
[14:03] <btdhero> http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html
[14:03] <btdhero> i will need infos about the mixing, though
[14:03] <Lumpy> well i am going to take a nap but i will bbl
[14:04] <Lumpy> that is the beauty of minimalism btdhero
[14:04] <Lumpy> you should have very little, if any mixing to do
[14:05] <Lumpy> ntl, i will bbl in about an hour or two
[14:07] <btdhero> ok :)
=== Lumpy is now known as Lump|AFK
[14:08] <Lump|AFK> and btdhero, by chance are you anywhere near Cleveland?
[14:09] <btdhero> :)) I am from Romania, Transylvania. don't tell me you didn't figured it out that I am not an American ...
[14:09] <Lump|AFK> nope sure didn't

[14:20] <contrapunctus> Insomnia, Lumpy? ;)
[14:22] <Lumpy> sorta
[14:22] <Lumpy> i lay down and i am wide awake
[14:24] <Lumpy> good day for more coffee anyhow
[14:24] <Lumpy> then again what day isn't good for more coffee? :P
[14:34] <Lumpy> i will try and nap again later is all
[14:34] <Lumpy> that is one of the benefits to being unemployed/self employed
[14:51] <contrapunctus> Lumpy
[14:52] <contrapunctus> What do you do for a living? o.O
[15:45] <btdhero> Lumpy: you still here?
[16:21] <Lumpy> sorta
[16:21] <Lumpy> i wasnt but i am now
[16:21] <btdhero> I got the list of the instruments
[16:22] <Lumpy> and contrapunctus, i do many things for a living
[16:25] <Lumpy> okay
[16:25] <Lumpy> and wow i thought holstein never left
[16:25] <btdhero> 2 x violins, 1 x viola , 1 x acordion , 1 x contrabass , 1 x saxophone
[16:26] <btdhero> the contrabass will go for the real low frequencies
[16:28] <Lumpy> sounds like a nice romanian ensemble
[16:29] <Lumpy> check this link out... i just found it myself
[16:29] <Lumpy> http://www.independentrecording.net/irn/resources/freqchart/main_display.htm
[16:30] <btdhero> well. we are only dancers, and we need to record our music
[16:30] <btdhero> our own music :D
[16:30] <Lumpy> you should see that the violin is going to be your highest pitched instrument
[16:31] <Lumpy> in the 16K range
[16:32] <Lumpy> so, using that rule of thumb i mentioned earlier
[16:32] <Lumpy> if you double that it would be 32K
[16:32] <Lumpy> but...
[16:32] <Lumpy> there are harmonics as well
[16:33] <btdhero> the webpage is not loading
[16:34] <Lumpy> kk
[16:34] <Lumpy> and i misspoke actually
[16:34] <Lumpy> have you decided how you are going to record it?
[16:34] <Lumpy> are you going to rent equipment and such?
[16:36] <Lumpy> how about this page
[16:37] <btdhero> I must do some research first, to see what I got in local shops
[16:37] <btdhero> and studios
[16:37] <Lumpy> http://obiaudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/frequency_chart_lg.gif
[16:38] <Lumpy> ntl, try and go at least double the freq of the highest possible freq instrument you will record and you should have a great recording

[16:38]  * Lumpy thought you never ever left here
[16:39] <holstein> freeshell is getting rebooted.. upgrade
[16:40] <btdhero> wow, now this is a usefull site
[16:40] <Lumpy> you use freeshell eh
[16:40] <Lumpy> kewlness and why am i not suprised
[16:40] <holstein> Lumpy: its a nice project, and it generally works well
[16:40] <holstein> Lumpy: its moredependable than me running a server here at the house these days
[16:40] <Lumpy> i had an account years back
[16:41] <Lumpy> i used to use it for IRC when they firewalled me at work
[16:41] <holstein> i like to leave it running in screen over there
[16:43] <Lumpy> i have a dedicated server that i rent
[16:43] <Lumpy> but i use machines locally to lurk
[16:43] <holstein> i might do that, if i need more... i did run one at my old place, but the net here is not great
[16:44] <holstein> comes and goes a lot
[16:44] <Lumpy> fortunately, my landlord give me access to the router so i don't have any firewall issues
[16:44] <Lumpy> if you need anything serverwise let me know
[16:44] <Lumpy> i rent a dedicated from 1and1
[16:45] <Lumpy> the tech director and i at the station have already talked it over and we will help you and your community out any way we can
[16:45] <holstein> i do work for someone on 1and1.. so far, im not impressed.. but im sure its fine for renting a server
[16:45] <Lumpy> lord knows you have been a godsend for us
[16:45] <holstein> im not sure godaddy is the answer for me either...
[16:45] <Lumpy> well compared to my previous host, they are great
[16:46] <Lumpy> i don't care much for godaddy personally
[16:46] <holstein> so far im ok with the domain name stuff, but the server stuff... eh
[16:47] <holstein> i dont like to have "all the eggs in one basket" so to speak anyway
[16:48] <Lumpy> i know what you mean
[16:48] <holstein> Lumpy: what were you talking about with your tech director?
[16:48] <Lumpy> one of my longer term goals it to clone the whole thing automatigically
[16:48] <holstein> helping out ubuntustudio?
[16:48] <Lumpy> yeah
[16:48] <holstein> Lumpy: thanks for that!
[16:48] <Lumpy> len was saying some folks had qs about streaming and such
[16:48] <holstein> just being a presence here in the channel helps a lot...
[16:49] <Lumpy> len listened in to the news cast last night
[16:49] <holstein> Lumpy: even if its just "i dont know, try here..." it makes us look "active"
[16:49] <Lumpy> and we have like ten channels available for streaming
[16:49] <holstein> nice
[16:49] <Lumpy> so, more or less, if you want one to experiment with and such
[16:49] <holstein> im about to test mumble again
[16:49] <Lumpy> and there are things i do know about
[16:49] <Lumpy> i didn't care for mumble
[16:50] <Lumpy> we use teamspeak 3 for what it is worth
[16:50] <holstein> i need realtime, if possible, otherwise, i would just do icecast or whatever
[16:50] <Lumpy> mumble was much more resource intense for anything out side of the mac architecture
[16:50] <holstein> Lumpy: is teamspeack pretty much realtime? you think the latency is better than mumble?
[16:50] <holstein> Lumpy: im not going to be doing music on it.. just speach
[16:51] <Lumpy> teamspeak 3 is supposed to be one of the better ones spec wise
[16:52] <holstein> it was on my list of things to try.. i just have already used mumble, and have an understanding of it (somewhat)
[16:52] <Lumpy> http://forum.teamspeak.com/showthread.php/48305-Mumble-vs-Teamspeak3
[16:52] <Lumpy> kinda an old post but it is still talking about version 3
[16:52] <holstein> Lumpy: thanks
[16:53] <Lumpy> and as far as latency goes.. we use it all the time and don't really notice any
[16:53] <holstein> that might save me some hassle
[16:53] <Lumpy> and i am more than happy to help out in any way i can
[16:53] <Lumpy> i doubt i will catch up to you any time soon on the os part
[16:54] <Lumpy> but some general audio stuff i might be of use for
[16:54] <Lumpy> brb i need to get more coffee
[16:54] <holstein> Lumpy: cheers!
[16:58] <Lumpy> it is brewing so i will be back and forth
[17:41] <btdhero> you still around, Lumpy ?
[18:27] <Lumpy> sorta
[18:27] <Lumpy> give me a few minutes
[18:33] <Lumpy> kk btdhero what up?

[18:36] <al4nc4ds> http://adafruit.com/adablog/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/RaspPiTattoo.png
[18:38] <btdhero> let's say I can't find a H2 in my area. I actually couldn't find one yet, but I am asking several music shops and recording studios. What esle could I use ?
[18:38] <holstein> btdhero: a zoom h2?
[18:38] <holstein> btdhero: what are you trying to do?
[18:38] <Lumpy> he is trying to record an orchestra holstein
[18:39] <Lumpy> an ensemble actually
[18:39] <Lumpy> i suggested something /like/ the zoom with and XY mic pattern
[18:39] <holstein> would be nice to have an h4
[18:39] <btdhero> 2 x violins, 1 x viola , 1 x acordion , 1 x contrabass , 1 x saxophone
[18:39] <Lumpy> i have one and they are nice
[18:40] <btdhero> one day, a few songs
[18:40] <holstein> i saw a guy track a big band like that, with the internal mics and 2 mics in the extra ins
[18:40] <Lumpy> but, ironically, you can't get the sample rate of an H2 in four track mode
[18:40] <Lumpy> like go figure
[18:40] <holstein> btdhero: i would go somewhere, if this is mission critical
[18:40] <holstein> btdhero: recording that many instruments is *not* trivial
[18:40] <holstein> if you want to separately multitrack those, you need 6 tracks (or more)
[18:41] <Lumpy> i have had real good results with the H4 and the H2 for stuff like that
[18:41] <holstein> if you want to do a stereo recording of them, then just use what you have
[18:41] <Lumpy> and he wants it to perform dance
[18:41] <holstein> an H2 is a nice and affordable option
[18:41] <btdhero> going to a recording studio could do it... but could also not give me what  I want.
[18:41] <Lumpy> you can find em for under 100 bucks
[18:42] <Lumpy> i would see if you could use a local hall or such btdhero
[18:42] <btdhero> here I think I saw it for few hundred bucks
[18:42] <btdhero> local hall ?
[18:42] <Lumpy> i have seen them as low as 98 USD
[18:43] <btdhero> and also usefull into the future
[18:43] <holstein> btdhero: im just suggesting, have realistic expectations
[18:43] <btdhero> if I could find one at a such low price, I could use it to record more
[18:43] <holstein> btdhero: i routinely record in all kinds of situations. recording myself, tracking in $200 a day studios, or $200 an hour studios
[18:44] <holstein> i would *not* expect to drop a hundred bucks and get studio quality results
[18:44] <holstein> if you dont want studio quality, i wouldl just use what you have
[18:44] <holstein> if you have a hundred bucks laying aroun, and h2 is a good value
[18:45] <Lumpy> just to be clear
[18:45] <Lumpy> i was not under the impression he needed studio quality
[18:46] <Lumpy> and nope the H2 is not that good
[18:46] <Lumpy> but for the buck, it is pretty impressive
[18:46] <Lumpy> i use the zooms for remote live concert recordings
[18:46] <holstein> its a lot of bang for the buck
[18:46] <holstein> the preamps on the h4 are actually pretty sweet
[18:47] <holstein> but, you gotta know how to use them, and the mic's are a factor
[18:47] <Lumpy> but, for what it is worth, i have yet to have any musician not be happy with the quality of the recording
[18:47] <Lumpy> the built in condensers work pretty darn well on em imho
[18:47] <holstein> if you take a zoom H4 into a nice studio and let an engineer plug a $5000 mic into it, and track you, the results will likely be pretty nic
[18:47] <holstein> nice*
[18:47] <Lumpy> and with the H4 i usually set it to 4 track mode and try and get a line off the board
[18:48] <holstein> Lumpy: they are, right?.. the built in mics are quite nice
[18:48] <Lumpy> i have had real nice experiences with both of them personally
[18:49] <Lumpy> and i don't own any 5000 dollar mics
[18:49] <Lumpy> i would likley buy a car first.. heh
[18:49] <holstein> i have a cheaper tascam one, and its OK.. similar to the H4
[18:49] <Lumpy> i like tascam
[18:49] <holstein> Lumpy: i have one $400 mic... and thats plenty :)
[18:49] <Lumpy> i stil have a 464 portastudio here in my studio
[18:49] <Lumpy> nice mixer but the tape deck part died a decade ago
[18:50] <Lumpy> but like i said, i do mostly live rock and roll
[18:50] <Lumpy> so it is like "close eonough for jazz"
[18:51] <Lumpy> for what they are though, esp compared to just 10 years ago, they are certainly nice
[18:52] <Lumpy> from what he told me
[18:52] <Lumpy> he is looking to record music to perform dance to
[18:52] <Lumpy> what he wants is a stereo recording to perform to
[18:53] <holstein> sure, but i can make one of those with my phone
[18:53] <Lumpy> so imho, the zoom like devices would be enough
[18:53] <holstein> is it as good as the zoom? no, but i have a phone already
[18:53] <Lumpy> and he was considering just renting equipment
[18:53] <Lumpy> likely you have a better phone than i do
[18:54] <Lumpy> you see those new zoom mics for the iphone devices?
[18:54] <Lumpy> and he also has a laptop but i have no idea what kind of mics and soundcard he has
[18:56] <holstein> Lumpy: right? i bet those are nice
[18:56] <holstein> and the soundcloud app is sweet for just uploading soething real quick
[18:57] <Lumpy> the only apps on my old phone are the addy book :P

[19:22] <Walther> Hello again, guys. I was just wondering if you could guide me through setting up Jack under ubuntu - I can't get the jack server running
[19:23] <Walther> Main goal is to be able to run renoise properly
[19:37] <holstein> Walther: i would try not using JACK, unless you just have/need to
[19:37] <holstein> Walther: otherwise, just open the GUI, and report errors and start troubleshooting
[19:37] <holstein> i suggest.. tryin using only onw sound card... test with an internal sound card for example
[19:37] <holstein> try using the command "gksudo qjackctl"
[19:38] <holstein> if JACK starts and runs as root, then you know you have a permissions error.. most likey the user not being in the audio group
[19:38] <holstein> sudo adduser username audio
[19:39] <holstein> be sure to check the settings in the setup tab
[19:39] <holstein> share screenshots, and ask questions
[19:39] <holstein> there is no good "how to get JACK running" guid
[19:39] <holstein> guide*
[19:39] <holstein> since it is very specific to your hardware case
[19:40] <Lumpy> btdhero: i see all kinds of compaqs with that model number
[19:40] <Lumpy> do you happen to know what kind of sound card it has?
[19:51] <Lumpy> time to get the kid from school bbl all
=== Lumpy is now known as Lump|AFK
[19:54] <btdhero> don't know exactly yet. I will note all notes about my already owned equipment tomorrow in the evening, during rehearsals
[20:09] <Walther> ...does anyone here by any chance have/use a novation launchpad
[20:10] <holstein> Walther: its USB correct? should just be plug and play
[20:10] <Walther> holstein: ...yeah, but I have yet to run into an app that would actually use it sensibly
[20:11] <holstein> Walther: you get it working with JACK, and route it to what you like
[20:11] <holstein> Walther: dont know what "sensibly" is to you
[20:11] <Walther> so not really an "issue" question per se, but just to ask if any of you have suggestions on what software to use it with and how to configugre it
[20:11] <holstein> i find, configuring things to work with operating systems they are not desgined to work with can take some work
[20:12] <holstein> Walther: use JACK.. then just route where ever you like
[20:12] <Walther> Well, first of all, the buttons do not correspond to a keymap as they do in say, ableton live - there are plenty of keys missing; it just jumps into a new octave on the next row
[20:12] <holstein> Walther: try #opensourcemusicians as well.. cheers... gtg
