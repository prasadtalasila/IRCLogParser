[16:29] <nubbix> What are they talking about, I zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....
[16:29] <spobat> i really disliked unity at the beginning as it was so different from gnome. Taking a closer look you recognize that it's actually pretty similar and also a *very* bit like OS from the UI and usage
[16:29] <spobat> like Mac OS X*
[16:29] <spobat> .. and that is awesome :pp
[16:29] <Euro> and what would be better for phones?
[16:29] <Euro> gnome2? :D
[16:29] <spobat> none?
[16:29] <spobat> android? :D
[16:30] <huydotnet> android
[16:30] <huydotnet> who need ubuntu on android phone =.=

[16:30] <Euro> i mean the desktop not the system ;)
[16:30]  * jragon yawns.

[16:31] <markusb> i hate the UI of Anroid!
[16:31] <markusb> *android

[16:31] <jragon> +1 markusb
[16:31] <JoseeAntonioR> if you guys have any questions, make sure to prefix them with the word QUESTION:
[16:31] <factor> How about using libhybris to get and run android apps on desktop and mobile devices.
[16:31] <mosu24> QUESTION  why doesnt cannonical contact micro pc manufacturers like Rikomagic to make a tv dongle powered by ubuntu?

[16:32] <jragon> QUESTION: can Leann turn her mic down or can you turn yours up.
[16:32] <markusb> have you seen the windows phone UI?
[16:32] <spobat> without any samsung or htc crap is really good
[16:32] <ba7a7chy> +1 jragon

[16:33] <spobat> jragon, the train already went on. and rim is not on it. it's too late now imo.
[16:33] <nubbix> Where did the "Q&A" go?
[16:33] <jragon> I know. I really hope someone makes some port to make BB phones Andriod.
[16:33] <spobat>  #ubuntu-on-air-q
[16:34] <markusb> in future there will be: Android, WP, iOS and Ubuntu
[16:34] <huydotnet> QUESTION: what are u guys talking about now ???
[16:34] <markusb> ubuntu is used bye programmers and linux fans
[16:34] <stulle_> +1 huydotnet
[16:34] <JoseeAntonioR> nubbix: this is not exactly a Q&A, but we will try to get to your questions
[16:34] <spobat> markusb, I even believe WP has no chance
[16:34] <markusb> really?
[16:35] <ba7a7chy> QUESTION: what about chaingin X11 with the new wayland ?
[16:35] <rej0hn> QUESTION: will the bug with the sd-card readers of dell laptops ever get fixed? :D i always have to echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/rescan to get it mount sd-cards ;)
[16:35] <spobat> markusb, I am not sure. They have a lot of money to push it.
[16:35] <designbybeck> ba7a7chy: I like that question
[16:35] <markusb> i have a windows phone 7
[16:35] <matt275> window 8 is horribe, now is the time to push ubuntu.
[16:35] <spobat> They started too late as well.
[16:35] <spobat> thus they missed the critical point.
[16:35] <spobat> ..when everything went to android.
[16:35] <huydotnet> WP started too late ? i dont think so
[16:36] <mosu24> +1 matt but without unity
[16:36] <markusb> that's true
[16:36] <buddyshashank> QUESTION:  Whether kernel bux fixeses are relase in pathches of current kernel too???
[16:36] <spobat> huydotnet, funny. they both started too early and too late
[16:36] <markusb> but i love the design of WP
[16:36] <spobat> too early: windows mobile: failed dramatically
[16:36] <markusb> and the hardware is fine too
[16:36] <spobat> too late: wp
[16:36] <huydotnet> haha
[16:36] <markusb> true story, spobat :(
[16:37] <spobat> imo, MS is a operating systems company - they shouldn't try to put their "brilliance" into every branche..
[16:37] <markusb> microsoft have a tick-tock: fine -> bad -> fine -> bad ^^
[16:37] <nubbix> Why is Ubuntu moving closer to a commercial oriented platform, is this true to the Linux community?
[16:37] <markusb> i think windows phone is a brilliant OS
[16:37] <markusb> but it was to late. that's right
[16:37] <rej0hn> good question, nubbix
[16:38] <huydotnet> it will be brilliant if it can run desktop app on phone :|
[16:38] <jragon> +1 nubbix
[16:38] <Phillip25> QUESTION:  how long will this session be ?
=== keni is now known as Guest40752
[16:38] <spobat> markusb, do you mean the user interface?
[16:38] <huydotnet> @nubbix: open source product with commercial quality, that's cool
[16:38] <spobat> because I'm not sure of the entire architecture yet
[16:39] <ba7a7chy> QUESTION: what about chaingin X11 with the new wayland ? <-----!!!
[16:39] <ba7a7chy> QUESTION: What about the 3.8 kernel updates for gaming performance improvments ???
[16:39] <spobat> my friend has one too, he upgraded a few weeks ago (I don't know the exact version) and whilst upgrading to a newer OS version his phone rebooted ~5 times.
[16:39] <markusb> if i compare android to WP7, my windows phone 7 is very very fast
[16:39] <markusb> in loading, switching, etc
[16:39] <factor> Question: What is the best program to use while working on the kernel/debug/etc.
[16:39] <spobat> this, in my opinion, reveals of massive internal difficulties and lacks.
[16:40] <spobat> linux (e.g. android) in comparison takes exactly 1 reboot at a maximum
[16:40] <markusb> but that's the problem of android
[16:40] <kunk> I have heard some people saying that Canonical does not give back to the community by submitting patches to upstream projects. How true is this? How much does Ubuntu/Canonical participate in upstream kernel development?
[16:40] <spobat> markusb, that is interesting. Per se, I think the .net framework really is faster than the java vm.
[16:41] <spobat> but what astounded me was that angry birds at the beginning was very flickery on wp, only.
[16:41] <nubbix> I feel like the Unity was forced on me as an Ubuntu user, now I really concider Linux Mint...
[16:41] <spobat> ..but then again, it might just be *bad programming* of rovio. I'm not sure about that.
[16:41] <markusb> if i think of my WP; it has a 1GHz Singlecore. if i think of other Androids, they have dual and quadcores
[16:42] <huydotnet> don't compare OS speed by its additional products like games or blah blah
[16:42] <markusb> so you can't match it..
[16:42] <matt275> #nubbix try Lubuntu
[16:42] <spobat> markusb, what exactly did you compare?
[16:42] <zolly> http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/ubuntu-phone-download-will-be-ready-late-february
[16:42] <markusb> the OS performance
[16:42] <spobat> yes, how?
[16:42] <markusb> like switching programs, switching menues
[16:42] <huydotnet> what about iOS guys?
[16:43] <beatpoet> I can barely hear the guy
[16:43] <beatpoet> SPEAK UP!
[16:43] <spobat> how do you switch between apps @ wp?
[16:43] <factor> Question: What file system is Ubuntu going to use, being much is moving to SSD.
[16:43] <spobat> but i hardly think it's going quicker than on either ios or android, they have very advanced multi-apps-techniques.
[16:43] <rcnc> low audio levels -- please get closer to MIC
[16:44] <nubbix> #Question Why does Leann ask the question, why are we here?
[16:44] <markusb> there a three keys: if you hold the left one, you can switch between opened apps
[16:44] <spobat> ios: slide left, right, up with 5 fingers | Android: press "task manager button."
[16:44] <dholbach> sorry, I can't change any of the mic settings :-(
[16:44] <spobat> markusb, since which version?
[16:44] <spobat> since the beginning?
[16:44] <markusb> no
[16:45] <markusb> at beginning they allowed running only one app (best thing for performance)
[16:45] <huydotnet> ios also started like that
[16:45] <markusb> since 7.5 you can open 7 apps. if you switch, the other one get freezed and dont use CPU
[16:45] <matt275> i dont think the regular user cares about kernel release
[16:45] <beatpoet> can't hear the guy
[16:45] <spobat> I don't see why they made this arbitrary 7-apps limit.
[16:45] <matt275> usability is more of a concern
[16:45] <huydotnet> they cares about performance
[16:46] <markusb> yes
[16:46] <spobat> if there's not enough ram, get some of the frozen apps out, otherwise keep them in.
[16:46] <HoOn> He'susing a crappy Apple headset! No wonder I can't hear him!
[16:46] <beatpoet> Compare Ubuntu Mobile to Android from a developer's perspective.
[16:46] <markusb> but there is no sense to have more opened apps
[16:46] <matt275> i would have to say  most users dont even know what a kernel is
[16:46] <huydotnet> +1 beatpoer
[16:46] <rej0hn> what is a kernel :O ?
[16:46] <rej0hn> ;)
[16:47] <spobat> markusb, but switching then is expectedly quicker.
[16:47] <matt275> i guess this is for developers tho
[16:47] <beatpoet> mumble mumble
[16:47] <markusb> yes
[16:47] <nubbix> Wonder if any Ubuntu employee dear to talk about Unity?????
[16:47] <beatpoet> Ubuntu Mobile VS. Android
[16:47] <Guest21623> #question what's your view about the brain fuck scheduler vs the stock scheduer in linux kernel
[16:48] <markusb> but it was a good decision
[16:48] <huydotnet> as a developer, i want to know, how much i will get if i sell my apps on "ubuntu mobile marketplace", and compare it to Google Play?
[16:48] <factor> kernelnewbies.org is good as well

[16:52] <markusb> i use win for programming .Net (visual studio'), and some software
[16:52] <spobat> huydotnet = markusb ?
[16:52] <spobat> k
