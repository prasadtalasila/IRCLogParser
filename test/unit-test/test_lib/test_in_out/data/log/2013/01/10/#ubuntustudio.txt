=== gtlarue_ is now known as LaRueGT
[07:48] <LaRueGT> is there a linux friendly chord progression helper, like harmony navigator or harmony improvisator?
[07:55] <zequence> LaRueGT: Yep. and that's you
[07:55] <zequence> Don't know if there is one, but you could make one in pd
[07:56] <zequence> And any other language too, of course
[07:56] <LaRueGT> too lazy
[07:56] <zequence> Still, the best method is probably to learn the piano, and start doing some basic stuff. Give it a couple of months, and it'll be perfectly natural
[07:56] <LaRueGT> guess the solution is one of those mobile apps
[07:58] <zequence> Guitar works too, but it's a bit harder to translate the chords to software later
[07:58] <LaRueGT> i got a midi board but im terrible at it
[07:58] <zequence> And you don't get an overview of the notes you use
[07:59] <zequence> LaRueGT: Start with the basics. The four chords. C, G, am, F
[08:00] <zequence> There should be some good piano guide out there somewhere
[08:01] <zequence> The trick is to not jump up and down with the hand over the keyboard. You move the hand as little as possible, and take the notes as closely as they come
[08:02] <zequence> Which means, you don't always keep your thumb on the base note, so to speak.
[08:03] <zequence> I'm telling you. To learn that would just take you a couple of days
[08:05] <zequence> I'm actually going to write a song maker software that will be able to do everything randomly, if you wish
[08:06] <zequence> There are so many parameters in music that people don't choose to do anything with anyway
[08:06] <zequence> In some ways, a computer would be much more creative than a person could ever be, if the software is well programmed

[09:02] <LaRueGT> I think that is the thing I was sorta looking for
[14:21] <cfhowlett> Why does this happen?  Produced a video with openshot; 25 mb.  used ffmpeg to embed the metadata.  no other changes.  13.5 mb result...
[20:30] <kobra> Hola
