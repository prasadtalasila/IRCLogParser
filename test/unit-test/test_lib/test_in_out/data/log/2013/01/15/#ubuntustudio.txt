[00:00] <lelapin> I have a question. If anybody's awake and has time for me :)
[00:03] <lelapin> First of all (maybe this might be the way I can get your attention) I *love* Ustudio. ;)
[00:07] <antivapor1> http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html hopefully is my solution, will know on reboot :]
[00:16] <lelapin> allo le bar ????
[00:16] <lelapin> salut antivapor1
[00:17] <antivapor1> hi
[00:17] <antivapor1> good news! my monitors now show up separate
[00:17] <antivapor1> BUT, they dont stay when i drag them
[00:18] <lelapin> good for you ! I just would like to repair an Ustudio without erasing all my /home :D
[00:18] <lelapin> Make it I'm just beginning to handle this stuff :)
[00:19] <lelapin> You mean you can have 2 separate monitors ? Is it under Xfece ?
[00:19] <antivapor1> this might help, but i'm not very expert with ubuntu http://askubuntu.com/questions/202857/cant-install-ati-proprietary-drivers-in-12-10
[00:21] <lelapin> it's not abour ptop drivers, juste the install
[00:21] <lelapin> since 10.04 there's no "ezpair" any more
[00:21] <lelapin> "repair"
[00:23] <lelapin> I just hope the new release can self-install/fix everything :)
[00:25] <lelapin> sorry... I'm bothering you
[00:25] <antivapor1> you're not bothering me, i just dont know anything about it :)
[00:26] <lelapin> you mean you never had ti repair a Ustudio system ?
[00:26] <antivapor1> nope
[00:26] <antivapor1> len-1304: should i make a script in arandr?
[00:28] <antivapor1> i see that i dont have an xorg.conf..
[00:31] <antivapor1> oh, i guess its not used anymore
[00:32] <antivapor1> i dont really want to make a script to run.. i'd rather permanently set this up :/http://askubuntu.com/questions/215277/create-startup-terminal-program
[00:33] <len-1304> antivapor1, The best way I know is to use the display setup
[00:34] <len-1304> Once you have the monitors where you want them then chaneg any setting in the display settings and then back. It will auto save
[00:34] <len-1304> This will break if you ever boot without one of the monitors plugged in.
[00:34] <antivapor1> okay, when i move one, it just moves itself back. lol
[00:35] <len-1304> Move using?
[00:35] <antivapor1> mouse
[00:35] <len-1304> with arandr?
[00:35] <antivapor1> yes
[00:35] <len-1304> Ga!
[00:35] <antivapor1> for real
[00:35] <len-1304> Is there an ATI utility to go with the driver?
[00:36] <len-1304> look under accessories or settings
[00:36] <antivapor1> yes, but just resolutions and such, no dual monitor that i can see
[00:37] <antivapor1> what! nvm, feel silly, i found it
[00:37] <len-1304> Great!
[00:37] <antivapor1> thanks for the help :D
[00:38] <lelapin> len-1304, ? Can you help me ?
[00:38] <len-1304> For what it was worth :)
[00:38] <len-1304> I can try...
[00:38] <len-1304> What is broken?
[00:38] <lelapin> Well. I tried Ustudio and loved it at the first glance.
[00:39] <lelapin> But I have about 9 HD online, some are NTFS
[00:39] <len-1304> OK
[00:39] <len-1304> And I thought 3 was bad...
[00:40] <lelapin> I don't reboot much, but since a few weeks it doesn'y do it any more, must use some tricks to boot correctly, and it doesn(t recognize all of USB HD
[00:40] <lelapin> even if i disconnect all external HDs
[00:40] <len-1304> Ok, where have you got grub?
[00:41] <lelapin> that leaves me 4
[00:41] <len-1304> So you have sda, sdb, sdc and sdd?
[00:42] <lelapin> I use UBCD but the problem is afetr Ustudio boots the first part
[00:42] <lelapin> lol, it seems it remebers up tu sdh
[00:42] <lelapin> I mean there are two problems in fact
[00:43] <len-1304> Are the drives always in the saem order?
[00:44] <lelapin> some are remote (3 USB HD, some USB jeys...) and 4 are SATA (2 NYFS) and 2 ATA
[00:45] <lelapin> the fixed ones are always at the same place on the interfaces, the others are USB or eSATA
[00:46] <lelapin> the thing is I xan't find any software that can help me fix permanently the problems for all USB/NTFS HDs and USB keys
[00:47] <len-1304> You are sounding beyond me.
[00:47] <lelapin> nd now when I reboot it just hangs
[00:48] <lelapin> I'ld like ti be able to have two screens, so don't look down :D
[00:50] <lelapin> did u try 12.10 ? Is it ok ?
[00:50] <len-1304> 12.10 was fine for me, now testing 13.04
[00:51] <lelapin> Is there a Ustudio 13.03 ?
[00:51] <lelapin> Is there a Ustudio 13.04 ?
[00:51] <len-1304> 13.04 is alpha right now.
[00:51] <lelapin> Is it stable ?
[00:52] <len-1304>  They come out every 6 months so .10 to .04 to .10 etc
[00:52] <lelapin> And what about 12.10 ?
[00:52] <len-1304> 12.10 has been released.
[00:53] <lelapin> what d'you think about ? They said it would be a great advance ?
[00:54] <len-1304> There are some changes, but everything is incremental.
[00:54] <len-1304> It depends on what you want to do.
[00:55] <len-1304> Any of them seem to record audio
[00:55] <len-1304> work well as a stage synth
[00:56] <len-1304> do graphics ... etc.
[00:56] <lelapin> Do you think I should use do-release-upgrade ? How does it work ?
[00:56] <lelapin> I do sound, synth, HD videos, photo
[00:56] <len-1304> Release up grade is ok so long as you are at least at 12.04
[00:57] <lelapin> I'm 12.04. So what should I do ?
[00:57] <len-1304> You may have to add the photography meta though
[00:57] <len-1304> 12.04 works pretty good, is there something you would like missing?
[00:58] <len-1304> 12.04 will continue getting updates longer than 12.10
[00:58] <lelapin> well, I'm working with Canon EOS and its RAW's not supportef, and I can't even make extfat work on my machine... :(
[00:59] <len-1304> I would not know about that.
[00:59] <lelapin> Canon RAW's proprietary
[00:59] <len-1304> I am mostly audio and record mostly acoustic sounds. (that is I don't do much in synth sounds)
[01:00] <lelapin> so, tell me the best and simplest way to get to 12.10. :)
[01:03] <len-1304> In my case I normally start from scratch.
[01:03] <len-1304> Install on an empty drive and copy my home dir into it.
[01:04] <lelapin> I found this : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades
[01:12] <lelapin> len-1304, I'm trying it... Feel no fera my friend. ;)
[02:20] <yugnip> i am trying to compile an app that depends on openGL which i thought i had, but for some reason the app doesn't http://pastebin.com/L4uJQvd2
[02:20] <yugnip> ubuntu 12.10
[03:34] <yugnip> nvm, i got it

[14:05] <studio-user679> Perhaps I am misunderstanding things, but are the login sessions configured differently in US12.10?
[14:05] <studio-user679> I seem have different files and programs available on the XFCE side than I do on the US side
[14:05] <studio-user679> at least while going through with synaptic
[14:09] <zequence> studio-user679: The available programs is not determined by the session, as those are not in user settings
[14:09] <zequence> studio-user679: Whatever is enabled in /etc/apt/sources* will show
[14:10] <zequence> studio-user679: Do you have an example of a program that you cannot find in one of the sessions?

[16:26] <lemonbar> I'm installing ubuntu-studio 12.10 on a Toshiba Satellite P-740, dual boot win7  and it is taking forever in post-installation - is this normal?  I've had this set-up before and it worked pretty well
[16:28] <lemonbar> also, I had an interruption in my wireless connection during the install...
[17:14] <holstein> i *never* install packages during install
[20:17] <tete_> hi, can someone please help me how to configure jackd to get my guitar working? i can see that the signal goes in but i can not hear anything :/
[20:17] <tete_> i even connected all inputs/outputs in jackd but still no sound
[20:17] <holstein> tete_: what audio device?
[20:18] <holstein> tete_: i would remove the guitar from the equation
[20:18] <tete_> for testing at the moment my laptop audio card :)
[20:18] <tete_> input comes from the rocksmith usb cable
[20:18] <holstein> open something like audacious, choose a known good audio file, play it with jack as the source
[20:18] <holstein> tete_: using multiple devices in JACK is not trivial
[20:18] <tete_> ok... will try that
[20:19] <holstein> tete_: you could use jack to record from the USB device and *not* monitor the guitar there
[20:20] <holstein> tete_: the rocksmith might not work with alsa
[20:22] <tete_> i am not even able to get a mp3 playing 0o
[20:23] <tete_> it just does not start, tried it with xine and audacity
[20:23] <tete_> and i have not seen where to set the audio daemon to jackd
[20:23] <holstein> tete_: i would remove variables
[20:24] <holstein> tete_: you are testing players and files and JACK and interfaces all at once
[20:24] <holstein> tete_: i would stop JACK
[20:24] <holstein> open audacious.. test a file
[20:24] <holstein> change audacious to JACK and test that *same* known good audio file with JACK
[20:25] <holstein> tete_: im leaving soon.. head to #opensourcemusicians if its dead in here
[20:25] <tete_> jack is stopped but audacious is still not playing.. very strange
[20:25] <tete_> ok thanks
[20:25] <holstein> tete_: is it a file you have codecs for?
[20:26] <holstein> tete_: will it play in something like VLC?
[20:26] <tete_> its a mp3 file and i just installed the codecs
[20:26] <tete_> will install vlc and test it with that...
[20:26] <holstein> cheers!
[20:26] <holstein> after that is sorted, then test anc configure JACK
[20:26] <tete_> jop, thanks :)
[20:26] <holstein> you wont easily use JACK with the USB device and the internal sound card at the same time
[20:26] <holstein> and the latency would be awful anyways
[20:27] <tete_> thats no problem... as its only for testing
[20:27] <tete_> hm vlc still no sound
[20:28] <holstein> tete_: then, you are either still running jack in the background, or you have no sound
[20:28] <holstein> !audio
[20:28] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[20:41] <tete_> ok sound is now working... had to change the snd-hda-model in the alsa conf, maybe the guitar is now working too
[20:47] <tete_> !mp3

[20:48] <tete_> hm as soon as i kill jackd the audio works, when i start it, no player starts the playback
[23:44] <antivapor> hi! i see empathy isn't on ubuntu studio by default, anyone know how to add it?
[23:45] <antivapor> nvm! its as easy as sudo apt-get install empathy...
[23:45] <antivapor> duh
[23:45] <antivapor> it usually is..
