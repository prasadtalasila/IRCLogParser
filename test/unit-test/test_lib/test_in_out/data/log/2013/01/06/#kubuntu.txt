[00:01] <AlexZion> hi everyone and of course happy new year ..... :)
[00:02] <AlexZion> I have some problem with kickoff , it doesn't show me nothing when i search for some application or even files .....
[00:02] <AlexZion> but actually I didn't change any setting....
[00:03] <AlexZion> nobody knows how to fix it , or even where to start looking for the problem ....
[00:28] <KimLaroux> AlexZion: System settings > Desktop Search
[00:29] <AlexZion> hi KimLaroux , actually I was cheching there , but I didn't find anything about kickoff or related to it ...
[00:30] <KimLaroux> this is the tool that allows kickoff to search for stuff
[00:31] <KimLaroux> actually, the main settings are in the kickoff panel itself. Click the wrench
[00:31] <BluesKaj> KimLaroux, yes  the search box at the top
[00:31] <KimLaroux> oh wait, you mean the menu?
[00:31] <KimLaroux> like window's start menu?
[00:32] <BluesKaj> the Kmenu
[00:32] <KimLaroux> Ah sorry, got confused
[00:33] <zacarias> Hi. My alt-Tab combination is not working. When I use alt with other keys (like numer keys to do the @, the £, etc.) it works. But when I use it in combination with other keys it doesn't. I tried to reset the alt-tab combination in System Settings but when I click the alt key it doesn't show up on the button waiting for the other key (unlike with Ctrl or Meta). Any help?
[00:40] <AlexZion> I'm back sorry ....
=== kubuntu is now known as Guest12963
[00:40] <AlexZion> yeah KimLaroux I mean the menu to open apps , it should be Kickoff as name ...
[00:41] <KimLaroux> yeah I forgot about the menu, as I never use it. I launch just about everything from the drop-down search
[00:42] <KimLaroux> One of the first thing I do on a fresh install is remove the kickoff applet from the taskbar
[00:43] <BluesKaj> KimLaroux, why ?
[00:43] <KimLaroux> because it's useless
[00:43] <AlexZion> well I just use it for apps taht aren't on my tool bar at bottom ...., so isn't so important but actually is a powerfull feauture for most of the user , especially the new one ..., so any problem there is a bad problem for the image of kubuntu ... :)
[00:43] <KimLaroux> Clicking 5 times to open an app is simply ridiculous
[00:44] <KimLaroux> I just tried and my kickoff search seems to work, though it doesn't search within folders
[00:44] <BluesKaj> use the quicklaunch
[00:45] <AlexZion> yeah , me tooo I use quick launch ...and is one of the most usefull plasmoid in my opinion ....
[00:45] <KimLaroux> I have a hiding tool bar at the left side of the screen that holds my most used apps
[00:45] <KimLaroux> does quicklauch updates itself based on most used apps?
[00:45] <AlexZion> I was really wondering when after a fresh install I didn't find it in the system .. :)
[00:46] <AlexZion> ohh wait , no , I just missunderstand ....
[00:47] <AlexZion> anyway , like i said , is not a big problem for me , but i see many people use it a lot so , it would be much better don't have anyproblem on it ....
[00:47] <BluesKaj> KimLaroux, no , one adds them to the launcher by dragging the apps out of the kmenu
[00:48] <AlexZion> but in any case maybe is just my config problem , actually I'm nearly sure about that ....
[00:49] <KimLaroux> BluesKaj: that seems like quite a useless applet, since you can do the same thing directly to the bar
[00:50] <BluesKaj> KimLaroux, well , to each his own , find the launchers and the kmenu very handy for my uses
[00:51] <KimLaroux> I also have apps icons to a bar, but I just don't see how using an applet for it improve this, as this function is already built into the bar
[00:51] <AlexZion> in my opinion on of the best plasmoid is Quick Access , and  is the one I was thinking about before ....., and I cannot understand why isn't anymore part of the default package , anyway ... :)
[00:53] <BluesKaj> we all have our own way of launching apps and etc ...theres noy much in going any further
[00:53] <BluesKaj> not much point
[00:57] <AlexZion> cheching package I see some broken package , I'll try to fix it probably in the last upgrade something went wrong ....
[00:59] <BluesKaj> KDE 4.10 not in the backports yet ? I see it in launchapad ppa for 13.04
[01:01] <AlexZion> ok done , now seems package are ok ...., I'll restart to check it , I'll see you in a while .....
[01:05] <AlexZion> I'm back .., luckely it was just a broken packages problem .....
[01:07] <BluesKaj> The Raring 3.7 kernel has HW recognition problems on some AMD 64 bit machines ,including mine : ( .  Installed OpenSUse 12.2 on the partition I set up for kubuntu 13.04. OpenSuse is much nicer then it used to be a few yrs back
[01:07] <AlexZion> for some reason using sudo apt-get autoremove , it needs to remove the workspace which is very dangerous things ...., if after that you don't reinstall it ..., I'm wrong ?
[01:07] <BluesKaj> AlexZion, dependency problems ?
[01:08] <AlexZion> yeah probablly , anyway , to be sure I remove it and than reinstall kubuntu-destop so it reinstall any dependencies ..., and it works fine now ....
[01:08] <BluesKaj> AlexZion, sudo apt-get -f install
[01:08] <BluesKaj> oh ok , AlexZion
[01:09] <AlexZion> Thanks anyway BluesKaj
[01:09] <KimLaroux> BluesKaj: I agree, but my point is that the features provided by QuickLaunch are _already_built_in_ the panel, and so the quicklaunch applet has no reason to even exist
[01:09] <AlexZion> the only problem which still remain unresolved is with amarok , which in my opinion is getting worst in stability ......
[01:10] <BluesKaj> I avoid amarok , clementine works for my setup
[01:10] <KimLaroux> AlexZion: agreed. I upgraded to 12.10 hoping they fixed stuff, but the shuffle feature is still broken
[01:11] <KimLaroux> I just don't understand how they manged to break something that worked fine, and released an upgrade that broke such a basic function

[01:18] <AlexZion> anyway , KDE is a really solid and powerfull stuff , and I really like the way you can customize everything, I love when I can build something around my needs ....
[01:19] <AlexZion> this is my way to "interpret" the KDE environment ..  http://imagebin.org/241869
[01:27] <KimLaroux> AlexZion: wow that looks great
[01:28] <AlexZion> yeah KimLaroux and is really comfortable to work with this confg ....., that's why I love KDE ... :D
[01:28] <KimLaroux> I'm still using win98 style XD
[01:28] <KimLaroux> with text taskbar and all
[01:28] <AlexZion> in my full hd screen , using minimal interfaces , I always have a lot of space to work  .. :D
[01:30] <AlexZion> I couldn't KimLaroux , I mean , I'm graphic designer , and my eyes needs to works in a nice place ... :D
[01:30] <KimLaroux> yeah...
[01:30] <KimLaroux> and I could not use your interface, too much stuff
[01:31] <KimLaroux> I always use apps in full screen anyways
[01:32] <AlexZion> yeah , but maybe it depends about resolutions ...
[01:32] <KimLaroux> more like size of screen
[01:33] <AlexZion> well , I'm on a laptop with 15" screen ...
[01:33] <AlexZion> but actually anything can be zoomed in if you need ...., in any applications where I work , or even any browser , and so on ....
[01:34] <AlexZion> so I can well manage to works on a multi window desktop
[01:35] <AlexZion> I mean , a window 1024 x 768 is just a bit more than half screen

[02:40] <zacarias> Hi. My alt-Tab combination is not working. When I use alt with other keys (like numer keys to do the @, the £, etc.) it works. But when I use it in combination with other keys it doesn't. I tried to reset the alt-tab combination in System Settings but when I click the alt key it doesn't show up on the button waiting for the other key (unlike with Ctrl or Meta). Any help?
[02:44] <tsimpson> zacarias: are you sure you're pressing Alt, not Alt-Gr? you usually want the left Alt rather than the one on the right
[02:47] <zacarias> I'm pressing alt. I'm using a Macbook keyboard, with no AltGr. I'm using the left (and only) alt. It was working yesterday, but today it stopped. I've shut down the computer and rebooted, but everything keeps the same.
[02:50] <tsimpson> it sounds like it's being mapped to the Alt-Gr key then, if you can use it as a combination key to produce other characters

[14:03] <XiaYixuan> is Kate very cool for programming in python?
[14:03] <XiaYixuan> I realize it highlights keywords
[14:04] <SunTsu> XiaYixuan: probably depends on what you want and what you need
[14:04] <XiaYixuan> I want that it tell me if I make a failcode
[14:04] <XiaYixuan> like, not giving the double point (:) or what not
[14:05] <SunTsu> XiaYixuan: That would need an editor who constantly parses what you write
[14:05] <XiaYixuan> ah, ok. then I guess it's impossible
[14:05] <XiaYixuan> it'd blow my laptop's CPU ._.

[14:12] <spm_Draget> Kubuntu 12.04 has a lower suppot-timeframe than ubuntu 12.04. But this is only valid for the KDE packages, or? The rest of the system comes from the original ubuntu repositories and thus is being update a while longer, correct?
[14:15] <spm_Draget> And what is the difference between two systems, one with ubuntu installed plus additionally installing kde-desktop compared to a kubuntu-system with a unity-desktop installed? Are the repositories of each other distro used and via-versa, or are there additional patches?
=== kubuntu is now known as Guest81058

[14:22] <shadeslayer> i.e 3 years
=== notze is now known as giorgiodinapoli
[14:23] <RagnaRok__> isn't the support for ubuntu 12.04 supposed to be for 5 years?
[14:26] <shadeslayer> RagnaRok__: servers are for 5 years
[14:27] <shadeslayer> "a Long Term Support (LTS) version had 3 years support on Ubuntu (Desktop) and 5 years on Ubuntu Server"
[14:27] <shadeslayer> from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS
=== timo is now known as Guest28337
[14:48] <spm_Draget> shadeslayer: On the very link you posted it says, that 12.04 is supported 5 years, desktop and server
[14:49] <spm_Draget> Again: I am wondering what exactly this means for kubuntu. If my kde-packages do not get any more bugfixes/updates it would really not be bad at all if cups/dbus/kernel/whatnot continues to get updates.
[14:50] <spm_Draget> And since all those packages are supported in ubuntu 12.04… and if Kubuntu would use these, then I should keep getting updates.
[14:55] <shadeslayer> ahhh
[14:55] <shadeslayer> spm_Draget: then 5 years for the desktop as well
[14:55] <shadeslayer> I forgot they changed it starting 12.04
[14:55] <shadeslayer> and we share the same base packages as ubuntu
[14:56] <shadeslayer> so if cups get's an update, everyone who is using *buntu gets an updated cups
[14:57] <spm_Draget> Nice. So for 'most' of the relevant packages, 12.04 will be secure for 5 years, no matter which *buntu is used.
[14:57] <shadeslayer> yep
[15:04] <XiaYixuan> give me good way to read two text files at once, please
[15:04] <XiaYixuan> Kate can only read one at once ._.
[15:13] <e_t_> XiaYixuan: Open both of the files in Kate, press Ctrl+Shift+L to split the screen, then you can look at each file in its own pane.
[15:14] <XiaYixuan> lol
[15:14] <XiaYixuan> I have the screen small. if I split it, I can't read nothing . . .
[15:15] <e_t_> Then try Ctrl+Shift+T to split the screen horizontally instead of vertically. If you don't have enough screen space to read two files at once, then no program will enable you to do so.
[15:55] <timjk> Im using Kubuntu 12.10.Any way to find out whether 32 bit or 64 bit version is installed ?
[15:57] <yofel_> open konsole and run 'uname -m', x86 is 32, x86_64 is 64bit
[15:58] <timjk> yofel_: I ran 'uname -m' it says i686
[15:58] <yofel_> ah, that's 32bit, my mistake
[15:59] <timjk> yofel_: ok
[16:07] <timjk> The processor on my machine is Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-2350M CPU @ 2.30GHz, which is a 64 bit processor. Should i have installed the amd64 version of kubuntu 12.10 or is 32 bit fine ?. I mean would installing the amd64 version have given me better performance ?
[16:09] <timjk> Also, im confused about the name amd64..isnt it meant for amd processors not intel ?
[16:10] <yofel_> amd invented the 64bit extension that's used these days, that's all
[16:10] <TheLordOfTime> ^ that
[16:10] <SunTsu> timjk: intel took amd's design, therefore it's amd64 for both
[16:10] <timjk> ok
[16:12] <nappa> I would say so, 64bit. How much RAM do u have installed?
=== spawn57 is now known as spawn[dead]

[18:25] <cornfeed> good morning...I am trying to acpid to work with  my toshiba and i am about at my wits end...I have tried everything....I have a toshiba portege r835-p81 (laptop). I have acpid running and I can use acpi_listen to see that is catching events like changing screen brightness, but it doesn't *actually* do anything. I looked into fnfxd but I can find anyone who has actually used it or described how it works on a system with acpid installed, or if the
[18:25] <cornfeed> y even conflict. anyone here in the mood to help me tackle this?
[18:26] <cornfeed> cant**
[18:33] <jeltsch> How can I keep my clock accurate with NTP in Kubuntu 12.10?
[18:33] <jeltsch> In KDE System Settings there is “Date and time”.
[18:34] <jeltsch> This dialog has a checkbox for using a time server.
[18:34] <jeltsch> If I check this box and press the “Apply” button, the dialog is disabled for a short time, and then the box is unchecked again.
[18:34] <jeltsch> No NTP-related process is running.
[18:39] <Snowhog> cornfeed: You can try adding the following as kernel parameters in /etc/default/grub:  noapic      acpi=noirq    Try each by adding it to the GRUB_CMDLIN_LINUX_DEFAULT= line or the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX= line. Save and run update-grub and the reboot. Alternatively, you edit the Grub menu entry and add these options 'on the fly'.
[18:40] <Snowhog> *GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=

[18:50] <cornfeed> jeltsch: is ntpd installed?
[18:51] <jeltsch> cornfeed: Hmm, it seems it is not.
[18:51] <cornfeed> it might be called just ntp in ubuntu not sure
[18:52] <jeltsch> To be more precise, the ntp package is not installed, but the ntpdate package is.
[18:52] <cornfeed> hmm yeah its called ntpdate
[18:52] <cornfeed> not sure
[18:52] <tsimpson> ntpd is the server side
[18:52] <jeltsch> The ntp package is for running ntpd, which is also used on the client to “continuously” keep the clock current.
[18:53] <jeltsch> The ntpdate package is for single updates.
[18:53] <tsimpson> all ntp servers are automatically clients, that how ntp generally works
[18:53] <jeltsch> So maybe the setting in KDE System Settings would work if the ntp package would be installed.
[18:54] <jeltsch> tsimpson: Yes.
[18:54] <tsimpson> you do not need the ntp package, just ntpdate
[18:54] <tsimpson> I'd look to make sure your ~/.kde is writeable, as well as all files/directories therein
[18:54] <jeltsch> tsimpson: But at what times will Kubuntu update my clock using ntpdate?
[18:55] <cornfeed> jeltsch: hahaha i just tried and have the same issue
[19:00] <tsimpson> jeltsch: looks like that setting is for the entire system, so it requires system settings launched as root (kdesudo)
[19:00]  * BluesKaj blames the UTC settings , in some cases it become default
[19:01] <jeltsch> tsimpson: I thought that KDE System Settings asked you for your password if it needs root privileges.
[19:02] <jeltsch> tsimpson: Interestingly, I was able to change the timezone without entering any password. Maybe this only worked because I had run another command with sudo not so long before.
[19:02] <Roubles> Hi all I have just switched from ubuntu to kubuntu and I don't quite understand how to use muon. Packages that I used in ubuntu don't seem to be present...
[19:03] <Roubles> For example I am unable to compile latex documents without certain additional packages which I am unable to find in muon software center.
[19:03] <tsimpson> jeltsch: you can change the timezone for your user, but the ntp setting needs to be done system-wide
[19:03] <Roubles> Does one have to add repositories or something?
[19:05] <tsimpson> Roubles: make sure you use Muon Package Manager rather than Muon Software Center, the latter is more concentrated on "applications" rather than packages
[19:07] <Roubles> tsimpson: Thanks
[19:07] <jeltsch> tsimpson: Aha. I thought that timezone changes would always be for the whole system.
[19:08] <jeltsch> tsimpson: At least, changing the timezone in KDE also affected shells that I started from the text console (without running KDE).
[19:08] <jeltsch> So where does KDE store the timezone setting? Does it change ~/.bashrc???
[19:09] <tsimpson> as far as I know, it's just stored under ~/.kde
[19:10] <tsimpson> /etc/timezone stores the system time zone

[21:00] <sbivol> cornfeed: apparently, „update-rc.d -f proftpd remove” would prevent service proftpd from starting
[21:02] <sbivol> cornfeed: sysv-rc-conf, rcconf, chkconfig are CLI tools to do the same thing
[21:03] <sbivol> cornfeed: an alternative for services not converted to upstart: update-rc.d apache2 disable

[22:18] <Key-Real_> Hi
[22:19] <Key-Real_> I moved from win to KUBUNTU today, I have wrote a graphic lib thouse days for DOS and WIN, to display a Vscreen through VESA for DOS or on a Window through GUI in Win or through DirectX.   NOW I wanna make the same under Linux, can some one help me?
[22:29] <micaela> i have problem, audio not work
[22:29] <micaela> can you help me please?
[22:36] <ndegruchy> hey, I have Ubuntu 12.10 (Kubuntu, actually) and I'm trying to make a Debian boot disk for another system. I have a flash drive ready-to-go, but when I try to do `cat debian.iso > /dev/sdd`, I get an immediate 'permission denied', even sudo'ing
[22:36] <ndegruchy> I've verified that /dev/sdd is the drive in question
[22:37] <ndegruchy> and it has 2gb, which should be more than enough for the i386 CD image
[22:38] <Snowhog> ndegruchy: See http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
[22:39] <ndegruchy> Okay, I give that a try. The system disk creator failed on building grub
[22:41] <ndegruchy> (also: TIL that there is a linux version of unetbootin)
[22:42] <OerHeks> i've used sudo dd if=kubuntu.iso of=/dev/sdb ( or sdc/sdd whatever)
[22:43] <ndegruchy> yeah, that was going to be my next question, if DD would be alright since I'm getting access denied
[22:43] <OerHeks> sudo might be the answer for your issue
[22:43] <ndegruchy> I tried :\
[22:47] <ndegruchy> okay, fingers crossed, lets see what happens.
[22:49] <ndegruchy> yay!
[22:49] <ndegruchy> thanks, guys!
[22:55] <OerHeks> have fun
[23:24] <hypnotoad_> hi there anyone can help me with k3b ?
[23:26] <Snowhog> hypnotoad_: What's your question?
[23:31] <hypnotoad_> i want to get k3b to rip my cd to an mp3 file. i have Kubuntu 12.04 with libk3b6-extracodecs installed (this looks like it was pulled in with some other package, i did not select it by hand). All the plugins visible in the configurek3b dialog are ticked. However, when i ask to rip the cd i cannot select MP3 as a fole format
[23:32] <hypnotoad_> Filetypes shown in the list box are either Ogg-Vorbis or "Wave"
[23:34] <OerHeks> to rip mp3's you need the lame codec package, AFAIK
[23:34] <hypnotoad_> OerHek5 - i'll take a look
[23:35] <OerHeks> restart k3b after that
[23:36] <hypnotoad_> OerHeks - nice one. thanks i now have mp3 as an option. many thanks
[23:36] <OerHeks> have fun
[23:58] <vladimir_> I do not know whay people do not use this tipe of configuration (simple) as they main work space http://i.imgur.com/tFQkr.jpg
