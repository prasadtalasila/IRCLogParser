[12:43] <fabo> hi
[12:43] <fabo> does someone know if we can copy a specific package version from ppa?
[12:44] <fabo> web ui seems to allow to copy only the latest
[12:46] <wgrant> fabo: You can see old versions if you change the status filter from Published to Superseded.
[12:48] <fabo> wgrant: awesome. thanks!
[12:49] <wgrant> fabo: Note that old files are deleted after about a week, so you can't go too far back into history.
[12:52] <fabo> wgrant: it resolved my dilema, i was looking for the previous build, "lost" because a recipe kicked in
[12:52] <wgrant> Great :)
[14:12] <shnatsel> Hello! I'm trying to access Launchpad from a Python script via launchpadlib. However, I can't figure out how to turn a *_collection_link into an actual collection. I've only found mentions of that on page https://dev.launchpad.net/Foundations/Webservice/Performance but https://launchpad.net/+apidoc/1.0.html doesn't mention any expansion methods. What am I missing?
[14:14] <shnatsel> specifically, I'm trying to iterate over source package recipes for a particular branch, but Launchpad returns a link when I request .recipes_collection_link property and I can't figure out how to access the actual collection
[14:16] <shnatsel> here's the proof-of-concept code I've put together so far, if it helps: http://pastebin.com/eGk1i3Vu
[14:22] <maxb> shnatsel: You just access .recipes and launchpadlib takes care of it
[14:24] <shnatsel> maxb: oh! Thanks!
[14:24] <shnatsel> maxb: mind pointing out where's that documented, so I don't have to ask next time?
[14:25] <maxb> I don't really know, it's been quite a while since I first learnt to use launchpadlib
[14:28] <shnatsel> I see. Thanks!
[14:30] <shnatsel> https://help.launchpad.net/API/Examples lacks any branch-related examples, which is a pity - it took me a long time to figure out how to get a branch object, despite the JSON/REST/whatever API reference mentioning those things. I guess I'll make a blog post about branches and these collection links.
