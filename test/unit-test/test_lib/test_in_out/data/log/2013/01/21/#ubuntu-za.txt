[13:21] <inetpro> Kilos: ai!
[13:21] <Kilos> rofl
[13:21] <Kilos> was waiting for that
[13:22] <inetpro> Kilos: did you add it to the Agenda>
[13:22] <inetpro> ?
[13:22] <Kilos> nope wanted to get permissions first
[13:23] <Kilos> the ubuntu way you know
[13:23] <inetpro> hmm.... who needs permissions?
[13:23] <Kilos> maybe i need to chown you all
[13:23] <inetpro> lol
[13:24] <inetpro> Maaz: make Kilos some coffee, please
[13:24] <Maaz> inetpro: Go get it yourself!
[13:24] <Kilos> lol
[13:24] <inetpro> ai
[13:38] <magespawn> would the greeter be installed in Maaz?
[13:53] <Kilos> that is the ultimate aim once it has been perfected
[13:54] <Kilos> but meantime can be any ibid
[13:54] <Kilos> hi hsch 
[13:54] <hsch> hi Kilos
[13:54] <Kilos> welcome to ubuntu-za
[13:55] <Kilos> magespawn, did you see all the new peeps today?
[13:57] <magespawn> yup Kilos very cool
[13:57] <Kilos> must be something in the air
[13:57] <Kilos> hi SmilyBorg_w 
[13:57] <Kilos> hmm
[13:58] <magespawn> new year fever?
[13:58] <Kilos> lol
[14:13] <magespawn> Kilos:  i remember the arguement against having two bots in the same channel
[14:14] <Kilos> yeah me too but there isnt another way unless we have greeter installed in maaz as is
[14:15] <Kilos> i was hoping the fly and/or weed could sort it lekker before we do that
[14:16] <Kilos> even the actual greeting can be reworded
[14:17] <magespawn> might take awhile peeps are busy
[14:18] <Kilos> ya
[14:45] <Squirm> woo, works over
[14:45] <Kilos> dont fall asleep now Squirm and miss the meeting
[14:45] <Kilos> have you added anything to the agenda
[14:45] <Squirm> I'm usually playing squash that time
[14:45] <Kilos> i
[14:45] <Kilos> no man
[14:45] <Kilos> one hour a month
[14:46] <Kilos> play squash tomorrow
[14:46] <Kilos> sjoe ek sukkel
[14:46] <Squirm> I'm going to play squash tomorrow
[14:47] <Squirm> and I haven't tried the new Ubuntu
[14:47] <Kilos> no matter man be at the meet
[14:47] <Squirm> yeah, for me, that pretty much covers the agenda
[14:47] <Kilos> hi hubx 
[14:47] <hubx> hi
[14:48] <Squirm> Kilos: why?
[14:48] <Kilos> because its a thing we do here on ubuntu-za
[14:48] <Kilos> monthly meets
[14:48] <Kilos> family get together
[14:49] <Squirm> I mean, the meeting could be a good idea. but needs some more topics. those could be covered in 5 min
[14:49] <Kilos> then add what you think is relevant
[14:49] <Kilos> or of interest
[14:50] <Kilos> or needs sorting out etc
[14:50]  * Squirm adds Meeting Agenda to the Meeting Agenda
[14:50] <Squirm> :P
[14:50] <Squirm> if I'm here I'm here if I'm not I'm not
[14:51] <Kilos> ai
[15:00] <superfly> Squirm: in a way having the meeting is more important than the items on the agenda
[15:02] <superfly> when it is our turn for re- approval in 2 years time, the meetings help to prove our case for approval
[15:05] <Kilos> maiatoday, you gonna make it?
[15:10] <magespawn> later all see you at the meeting connection permitting
[15:10] <Squirm> superfly: ah, so you actually have to apply to be an official Ubuntu channel

[15:16] <nuvolari> the parentals are visiting too :P so tough times
[15:16] <Squirm> nuvolari: they must be enjoying the beach
[15:16] <Squirm> well, when it's not raining
[15:25] <superfly> Squirm: well, the IRC channel is "free"
[15:25] <superfly> we're an official LoCo and that requires approval

[17:53] <Kilos> hi locodir-user 
[17:53] <nuvolari> we probably need to structure it?
[17:53] <Kilos> welcome to ubuntu-za monthly meeting
[17:53] <nuvolari> so far only "All posts" and Events exist
[17:54] <queery> Maybe we need an app :p
[17:54] <nuvolari> queery: it's called Google+ for mobile :P
[17:54] <inetpro> so how many members still use fb?
[17:54] <locodir-user> Hi Chas.I as locodir-user. Sorry to be late. I just want to observe tonight. Thanks
[17:55] <nuvolari> I dig superfly's speedy typing

[17:56] <queery> So who is getting ubuntu mobile
[17:56] <inetpro> Kilos: I'm not sure
[17:56] <Kilos> i think it was 45 with drubin
[17:56] <inetpro> Kilos: we should probably keep some form of stats
[17:56] <kbmonkey> Kilos, yes you are, and in my circles too
[17:56] <Kilos> ty kbmonkey 
[17:56] <Kilos> i dont go there often
[17:57] <nuvolari> things are becoming a social nightmare these days
[17:57] <kbmonkey> me neither, some geeks we are, huh ;)
[17:57] <Kilos> lol
[17:57] <Kilos> the pro lives there and on twitter
[17:57] <queery> I think we should scale down to be quite honest
[17:57] <Kilos> oh the ssh thing
[17:57] <nuvolari> google+ brings everything together
[17:57] <kbmonkey> good call queery 
[17:57] <inetpro> multiple social mediums should not matter
[17:57] <nuvolari> ditto, I agree on that
[17:58] <queery> I vote for -google
[17:58] <Cantide> inetpro, sometimes there are nice posts on the FB page which i read
[17:58] <inetpro> as long as we don't expect everyone to be everywhere 
[17:58] <Cantide> and sometimes 'like'
[17:58] <Kilos> no man leave it
[17:58] <Kilos> the dlug guys have hangouts on g+
[17:58] <inetpro> I'll be honest I couldn't keep up on the fb page and unsubscribed there
[17:58] <nuvolari> oh yeah, that was fun
[17:58] <Kilos> so maybe we can attract some of them here
[17:59] <nuvolari> 3 so far this year
[17:59] <nuvolari> we're not a crowd yet :P
[17:59] <queery> Cool
[17:59]  * inetpro finds that G+ community is very useful but still under utilised across many forums
[17:59] <inetpro> uh oh
[18:00] <nuvolari> oh the splits
[18:00]  * queery agrees
[18:00] <nuvolari> :-/

[18:01] <magespawn> Hey nuvolari
[18:01] <queery> Yea. I say murge
[18:01] <nuvolari> yeah, google+ pages now feel a bit redundant

[18:01] <nuvolari> to be honest
[18:01] <Kilos> hi magespawn 
[18:01] <inetpro> kbmonkey: no, there's a ubuntu-za page with a ubuntu-za community

[18:02] <nuvolari> I tried to maintain a page but it's really a pain
[18:03] <queery> Ok we really also need to move on
[18:03] <inetpro> kbmonkey: unfortunately when I created the page g+ communities didn't exist yet
[18:03] <queery> Can we discuss this on the mailing list
[18:03] <kbmonkey> yes, let us move on. 
[18:03] <queery> Or better in the g+ group
[18:03] <inetpro> I'm sure we can move on

[18:14] <nuvolari> Maaz: agreed Share some information on the mailing list about ubuntu development versions
[18:14] <Maaz> Agreed: Share some information on the mailing list about ubuntu development versions
[18:14] <nuvolari> Maaz: topic Events
[18:14] <Maaz> Current Topic: Events
[18:15] <queery> We need more people to attend ubuntu hours 
[18:15] <nuvolari> past event: major high for us: Ubuntu-ZA re-approval
[18:15] <mazal> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
[18:15] <queery> (especially the ones I org) 
[18:15] <mazal> That might be it , I THINK :P
[18:15] <Banlam> aww
[18:16] <nuvolari> It's a bit hard here in KZN :-/ but we're starting to get things in motion
[18:16] <nuvolari> we ended the year well, and we started off with a couple of test hangouts, and our first 'broadcast'
[18:16] <Kilos> nuvolari, rope in the dlug peeps
[18:16] <nuvolari> I'll find the link quick
[18:16] <queery> I'll org one for feb
[18:16] <Kilos> with a strong rope
[18:16] <magespawn> Very spread out community
[18:17] <inetpro> and I guess this is where we should take note of some comments from superfly after our re-approval, there's lot's more that should be done to make us an awesome LoCo
[18:17] <queery> Same in jhb pta
[18:17] <nuvolari> for anyone interested in our hangout + notes, see https://plus.google.com/u/0/101611463436696898503/posts/Qj7wqkmBgyz
[18:17] <inetpro> and I think what is happening in Durban is great
[18:18] <inetpro> nice to see things happening
[18:18] <queery> Yea that's great 
[18:18] <Kilos> hi conradvo 
[18:18] <nuvolari> hmm, I need to find the youtube link though
[18:18] <Kilos> you can still login with maaz
[18:18] <queery> thought the one durbs lady don't like working with us... 
[18:18] <kbmonkey> I'd be keen for a meetup nuvolari. a trip to ballito sounds nice.
[18:19] <Kilos> SmilyBorg, ?
[18:19] <queery> Who? 
[18:19] <SmilyBorg> I'm still here
[18:19] <kbmonkey> ah kudos for that hangout link
[18:19] <queery> Ur a quiet one
[18:19] <nuvolari> there we go: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIOSOHHJkDM
[18:19] <Kilos> you peeps wanna join our ubuntu hours down there SmilyBorg 
[18:19] <SmilyBorg> sorry, just tired
[18:20] <Kilos> your dlug peeps
[18:20] <Kilos> you can convince them for us
[18:20] <nuvolari> I'll organise one kbmonkey 
[18:20] <SmilyBorg> I can mention it on the mailing list
[18:20] <Kilos> please do
[18:20] <kbmonkey> thanks SmilyBorg :)
[18:20] <queery> an ubuntu hour hangout? 
[18:21] <SmilyBorg> we're a bit of a semi organised chaos
[18:21] <StephanWessels> That could work
[18:21] <nuvolari> queery: I'm up for that!
[18:21] <kbmonkey> also like to mention the chatter about possible gaming/lan meetups
[18:21] <Cantide> what did i miss?
[18:22] <nuvolari> one thing we saw is that we need to plan ahead, our hangout lasted 2 hours :P
[18:22] <kbmonkey> probably trickier to organize but worth a talk
[18:22] <queery> Well the idea of the hangout is to go to a public place but I guess it could work for those that are far to tune in
[18:22] <SmilyBorg> that sounds like fun kbmonkey
[18:22] <magespawn> That would be good kbmonkey
[18:22]  * inetpro just wishes that data was cheaper
[18:22] <kbmonkey> agrees
[18:22] <nuvolari> +1 on that
[18:22] <Kilos> yeah
[18:23]  * queery agrees
[18:23] <nuvolari> ok, moving on?
[18:23] <kbmonkey> yes :)
[18:23]  * inetpro tries to limit all things video as far as possible
[18:23] <queery> Maaz agreed we wish data was cheaper 
[18:23] <Maaz> queery: If you say so
[18:23] <nuvolari> eek, need a title
[18:23] <inetpro> lol
[18:23] <Banlam> lp

[18:24] <nuvolari> I just need to update the page, hang on
[18:24] <magespawn> Could do timezone gaming
[18:24] <inetpro> nuvolari: so what time do you normally start playing games?
[18:25] <Kilos> yeah the idea is good
[18:25] <nuvolari> inetpro: I'm not a gamer :P
[18:25] <nuvolari> But I played Oil Rush last night
[18:25] <inetpro> IIRC the mexicans planned it to start at 17:00 SAST

[18:35] <queery> Dewald noeth
[18:36] <SmilyBorg> I've done various kinds of vpns. some are easier than others
[18:36] <kbmonkey> okay SmilyBorg :)
[18:36] <queery> Look for the gay guy... 
[18:36] <inetpro> ai!
[18:37] <kbmonkey> curious to setup a vpn to try loco gaming
[18:37]  * SmilyBorg nods
[18:37] <SmilyBorg> site to site isn't too bad
[18:37] <kbmonkey> for those games that dont play via hosted servers
[18:37] <kbmonkey> ok :)
[18:37] <SmilyBorg> but muti site stuff starts geting hectic
[18:38] <inetpro> Kilos: meeting is over, now you can talk again
[18:38] <kbmonkey> not much of a gamer anymore. but tried a freeciv game 2 weeks ago. my brain melted trying to understand the tech tree :p
[18:38] <Kilos> haha
[18:38] <SmilyBorg> hehe
[18:39] <inetpro> SmilyBorg: nice to see you back here as well
[18:39] <SmilyBorg> I've mainly been playing RPGs for the last while. Still wandering around Skyrim picking flowers :-)
[18:39] <kbmonkey> yes, it certainly is nice to see you back smily
[18:39] <SmilyBorg> Thanks
[18:40] <SmilyBorg> just been too busy at work to be on IRC during the day and rather tired in the evenings
[18:40] <kbmonkey> been playing mtg more than pc though
[18:40] <Kilos> mtg?
[18:40] <inetpro> SmilyBorg: no worries, we all in the same boat
[18:40] <kbmonkey> I feel the same SmilyBorg. 
[18:41] <kbmonkey> Kilos, magic the gathering. its a collectible card game.
[18:41] <kbmonkey> paper technology. old school.
[18:41] <SmilyBorg> g, that brings back memories. I had MTG cards when I was in high school
[18:42] <mazal> I have a question re the development release
[18:42] <magespawn> I have a stack of them
[18:42] <mazal> If I install this: raring-desktop-amd64.iso from here http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
[18:43] <mazal> Will it then update the daily changes just like the stable ubuntu's , or do you have to install the latest iso say every week to get the changes ?
[18:43] <Kilos> ask tumbleweed mazal 
[18:44] <Kilos> he is one of the dev team
[18:44] <Kilos> and drussell 
[18:44] <kbmonkey> well I'm going afk to make some tea
[18:45] <kbmonkey> that is a good question, mazql
[18:45] <mazal> I really want to try this , but don't want to DL an iso every few days
[18:45] <Kilos> and i tink the fly plays as well
[18:45] <mazal> Updates every day would be fine
[18:46] <Kilos> it most likely will
[18:46] <kbmonkey> would the development rlease be based on debian sid?
[18:46] <conradvo> hi mazel i instaaled raring-desktop-i386.iso in vb and it updates every day
[18:46] <mazal> Thanx conradvo 
[18:47] <mazal> So it already have it's own repositories ?
[18:47] <conradvo> it looks like it use some of 12.10 and its own
[18:48] <mazal> Cool , now I know what that "project" is I was looking for hehehe
[18:48] <conradvo> i just updated and there was 5.7 mb of updates to unity
[18:51] <mazal> Ok I'm going horizontal 
[18:51] <mazal> Sleep well everyone
[18:51] <Kilos> night mazal 
[18:52] <Kilos> hey new guys you are welcome here daily not just for meetings hey
[18:52] <Kilos> ubuntu-za should be a default login app
[18:52] <kbmonkey> if only i could get on to irc in the day, kilos :)
[18:53] <Kilos> kbmonkey, you friends with the dlug peeps
[18:53] <Kilos> someone must have a workaround
[18:53] <Kilos> but no excuses for staying off for weeks at a time
[18:54] <kbmonkey> not much one can do when the net is locked down like a klei os se g** ;)
[18:54] <Kilos> haha
[18:54] <Kilos> unlock it man
[18:54] <kbmonkey> I *could* use ssh on port 80 if I had a server to setup as such
[18:54] <Kilos> google is your friend
[18:54] <kbmonkey> lol
[18:54] <SmilyBorg> AndChat for android
[18:55] <kbmonkey> the computer that controls the net, is behind a vault and not my property.
[18:55] <SmilyBorg> that could probably be arranged kbmonkey
[18:55] <Kilos> my modem was locked to saudi arabia too
[18:55] <kbmonkey> haha
[18:55] <Kilos> google sorted that
[18:55] <kbmonkey> yes I will install andchat again SmilyBorg :)
[18:56] <Kilos> no man i cant get andchat working here
[18:56] <Kilos> all that funny stuff
[18:56] <Kilos> android stuff
[18:56] <SmilyBorg> I could probably arrange a shell account and port forward on one of my machines here. I have a server that sits mostly idle at home on my uncapped
[18:56] <kbmonkey> got my phone updated to a newer gingerbread, pretty glad about that
[18:57] <kbmonkey> i have a shell account on port 2222 but that port is also blocked.
[18:57] <Kilos> ai!
[18:57] <kbmonkey> however AndChat should work
[18:57] <SmilyBorg> I can do on port 80. not hosting anything public here
[18:58] <kbmonkey> that is kind to offer SmilyBorg :)
[18:59] <kbmonkey> how about I bug you about it if I struggle with the android too much? :)
[18:59] <SmilyBorg> oki
[18:59] <Kilos> night all. sleep tight
[19:00] <Vince-0> cya!
[19:00] <kbmonkey> the building at work has as many layers of concrete as a french pastiserie, so signal is flakey in certain rooms
[19:01] <SmilyBorg> where about do you work kbmonkey?
[19:01] <kbmonkey> I will give it a try though. always worth a try
[19:01] <kbmonkey> it is one of those call-centre buildings behind gateway
[19:02] <SmilyBorg> aah
[19:02] <SmilyBorg> oki
[19:02] <SmilyBorg> the gateway area sucks for cell coverage too
[19:02] <SmilyBorg> I think the towers are over saturated
[19:02] <SmilyBorg> had issues at my previous 2 jobs that were across the road from gateway
[19:03] <kbmonkey> yep, it certainly is. I find forcing 2G gives better signal, mostly :)
[19:03] <SmilyBorg> on which provider? last time I did that on MTN I lost all data access
[19:03] <kbmonkey> and 8ta has the bestest signal of all
[19:04] <kbmonkey> 8ta for data-only (like now), in the day its vodacom (for calls too)
[19:04] <SmilyBorg> oki
=== ChanServ changed the topic of #ubuntu-za to: Ubuntu South Africa http://ubuntu-za.org || MList: http://bit.ly/MCOujZ || PBin: http://slexy.org/ || Logs: http://irclogs.ubuntu.com || Next Meeting: Mon, 18 Feb 19:30, Agenda: http://bit.ly/10zyZFD || Twitter: https://twitter.com/ubuntuza
[19:05] <SmilyBorg> a few years back i heard that mtn had split their data and voice stuff on the towers so 2g was voice only, at least in some areas
[19:06] <SmilyBorg> it seemed about right from the anecdotal evidince from tests I did along with my coleags at the time
[19:06] <superfly> *sigh*
[19:07] <kbmonkey> what's wrong, superfly ?
[19:08] <superfly> kbmonkey: being a parent is tiring...
[19:08] <inetpro> superfly: sorry
[19:08] <kbmonkey> I guess 2G could carry voice data, isn't voice like only 16Khz data rate?
[19:08]  * superfly is just trying to relax a little before heading off to bed
[19:09] <kbmonkey> kids do demand a lot of attention, don't they.
[19:09] <superfly> kbmonkey: and energy
[19:10] <inetpro> kbmonkey: luckily it's not just all sufferings
[19:10] <kbmonkey> :]
[19:11] <kbmonkey> like the prospect of creating a little hacker? 
[19:14] <SmilyBorg> aah, interesting. standard gsm is 2G. 1G was the old analog cell tech
[19:15] <kbmonkey> wow it does go back a long way
[19:15] <SmilyBorg> then gprs is 2.5G and Edge is 2.75G
[19:15] <SmilyBorg> at least according to this artical
[19:18] <kbmonkey> well I am going to do some recreational activity to reset the brain before sleep ^.^
[19:18] <SmilyBorg> sounds like a plan
[19:18] <kbmonkey> it's a good way to have nicer dreams
[19:19] <kbmonkey> cos the brain seems to dream in loops otherwise
[19:19] <SmilyBorg> I should probably find a better option than watching Dexter
[19:19] <kbmonkey> haha!
[19:19] <superfly> me too, I'm going to write some unit tests
[19:19] <SmilyBorg> eek. I've had that before when stressed or overly excited or stimulated
[19:20] <kbmonkey> been invited to a poker game tomorrow, so might not get online then. so have a good night, all.
[19:21] <SmilyBorg> sweet dreams cutey ;-)
[19:21] <kbmonkey> ;)
[19:43] <magespawn> Later all.
