[14:27]  * Laney grumbles at broken udt stuffs
[14:29] <tumbleweed> right, i never got there last night
[14:29] <tumbleweed> bdrung: what was your problem with the formatting from logging?
[14:29] <Laney> seems like it would have been nice to check that nothing got broken before updating devscripts
[14:29] <tumbleweed> I can go with that :P

[15:26] <Adri2000> is it a problem that an uploader uses obviously a nickname instead of his realname in debian/changelog?
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[15:30] <Zhenech> not in debian
[15:31] <Laney> no, I don't think so
[15:31] <micahg> as long as the e-mail address is valid, I don't see a problem
[15:33] <tumbleweed> I do encourage people to use real names, when sponsoring their uploads
[15:34] <xnox> Adri2000: they do and should if they are under 18
[15:35] <ogra_> uploader entires are usually tied to a gpg key ... hard to get that signed if you dont use a real name
[15:36] <ogra_> (at leas it should be hard to get signed :) )
[15:36] <micahg> ogra_: if it's sponsored, it shouldn't matter (it's signed by the sponsor)
[15:36] <micahg> but, I think encouraging real names is a good thing
[15:37] <ogra_> well, the original request said uploaders
[15:37] <ogra_> yeah, ++
[15:46] <Adri2000> yeah, the context is about sponsoring an upload of someone not using his real name
