[00:14] <jeramy> Alright, does anyone to help a newb?
[00:16] <jeramy> I have kubuntu installed with windows, and my additional drivers app is broken. Does anyone know what causes this?
=== jeramy is now known as jeramyeggs
[00:19] <jeramyeggs> Anyone?
[00:23] <jeramyeggs> I believe that jockey(?) is crashing, and this causes the additional drivers package to stop responding.
[00:28] <mandoguit> jeramyeggs:    maybe try running it from terminal to see if that makes a difference      type      sudo jockey-kde       and then type in your password (you won't be able to see what you are typing but that is normal) and then press the Enter key
[00:30] <mandoguit> jeramyeggs:   also just a thought..........if you have just installed kubuntu, suggest you download all upgrades as those may contain fixes for your problem
[00:33] <jeramyeggs> @ mandoguit: am going to try and update, then the command, give me 0ne moment.
[00:36] <mandoguit> jeramyeggs:   look for    Muon Update Manager      should be in Menu -> System
[00:37] <jeramyeggs> @ mandoguit: running it now, took me a minute to find it.
[00:40] <jeramyeggs> @ mandoguit: There are quitee a few. Updating them all. Another quick question while we wait. I had dual monitors working thru the installation, but apon reboot, i lost my Tv. Why does this happen?
[00:46] <mandoguit> jeramyeggs:   not quite sure to be honest; could be they are using xrandr temporally for the livecd etc.   If you have nvidia (for example) you can use the program that gets installed along with the nvidia drivers to set up dual monitors after installing.   you should also be able to use xrandr too but I have no personal experience with using it
[00:49] <jeramy> @ mandoguit: Still updating. That makes sense. I do have Nvidia GPU, and they are horrible about supporting Linux aren't they.
=== jeramy is now known as jeramyeggs
[00:54] <mandoguit> they have been known to raise the ire of the linux community from time to time (including Linus Torvalds) ;-)    there is a nice little video clip (should be on Youtube I would imagine) showing Linus Torvalds emoting his feelings towards nVidia  lol
[00:56] <jeramyeggs> @ mandoguit: Seen it, constantly watch tech news. I thought i was pretty good with tech, but linux is making me humble. Tried the command, and it thru errors, are we allowed to post the output of terminal?
[00:58] <jeramyeggs> @ mandoguit: Updating security is taking forever.lol
[00:58] <mandoguit> jeramyeggs:   3 lines max iirc...........anything over that copy/paste to     pastebin.com   or the ubuntu paste site (of which the url I can't remember off hand)
[01:00] <jeramyeggs> @ mandoguit: First error-Error: "/var/tmp/kdecache-jeramy" is owned by uid 1000 instead of uid 0.
[01:00] <mandoguit> sheesh....  mind like a sieve here.     it's    paste.ubuntu.com
[01:00] <mandoguit> you can ignore that one
[01:02] <mandoguit> ohhh....I see this channel has it's own paste site   paste.kde.org  (type /topic)
[01:04] <jeramyeggs> Mandoguit: hope this is right.http://paste.ubuntu.com/1574557/
[01:08] <jeramyeggs> @ mandoguit: Everything has been updated.  Funny, I tried the command again, and the load bar for searching for additional drivers popped up for a moment then dissappeared. System needs to update on reboot. Gonna reboot real fast, are you still gonna be here in a few?
[01:09] <mandoguit> jeramyeggs:  for another 10 minutes or so.
[01:09] <jeramyeggs> Well if i dont catch you, thanks....; )
[01:10] <mandoguit> ok    good luck   hope things work out for you.   if I am not here I am sure that there are others who will chime in to help :)
[01:11] <jeramy> Hey, just got it to load with the command, you know anything about the nvidia drivers? like which might be the best to load?
[01:12] <mandoguit> try -current (recommended) first
[01:13] <jeramyeggs_> Thanks again man, havent had to have my hand held since my first Android...
[01:14] <mandoguit> np...glad to help.
[01:24] <jeramyeggs> @anyone, Alright, I got my additional drivers package working, and downloaded the current Nvidia driver. Now hdmi doesn't show up in displays, do i need to configure Nvidia X server?
[01:36] <jeramyeggs> Anyone want to be a good samarita, and help me with my display problems?

[11:56] <KJ_agent007> hi fabian
[11:56] <KJ_agent007> hi pivert
[11:56] <KJ_agent007> any one here know irc commands?
[11:57] <Tm_T> KJ_agent007: what exactly you're looking for?
[11:58] <KJ_agent007> just basics, I guess
[11:59] <KJ_agent007> you can find it on google, I'd expect
[11:59] <Tm_T> well, /join #channelname to join to channel, /part #channelname to leave channel
[11:59] <Tm_T> /nick newnick to change nick
[11:59] <KJ_agent007> the hubby showed me how to use this after yahoo shut down its chat rooms
[11:59] <Tm_T> those are the basics
[12:00] <KJ_agent007> ok, this is a gui for irc running on kubuntu 12.10
[12:00] <KJ_agent007> it's called quassel
[12:00] <KJ_agent007> all irc commands will work on it too?
[12:00] <Tm_T> those atleast
[12:01] <KJ_agent007> alrighty
[12:01] <Tm_T> and most of the others too
[12:01] <KJ_agent007> oh cool
[12:01] <KJ_agent007> you can get channel listings by right clicking on the server
[12:03] <KJ_agent007> can you get viruses on kubuntu?
[12:03] <Tm_T> !virus | KJ_agent007
[12:03] <ubottu> KJ_agent007: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[12:04] <KJ_agent007> alrighty, that's what my hubby said.
[12:04] <KJ_agent007> why can't you get viruses on linux?
[12:04] <KJ_agent007> is it because of the way the file system works?
[12:05] <Tm_T> KJ_agent007: how the operating system works
[12:05] <ovidiu-florin> hello world, I got this error while I was apt-get update 'ing, I can't instal the updates I think becaause of this. http://paste.kde.org/657398/ any recommendations on how to fix this ?
[12:07] <shadeslayer> KJ_agent007: long story short, in order to do anything that affects the system in any way you need to enter your administrative password
[12:07] <shadeslayer> for eg. installing packages and what not
[12:08] <KJ_agent007> makes sense
[12:08] <KJ_agent007> not many viri are able to do that
[12:10] <KJ_agent007> what about worms?
[12:10] <KJ_agent007> like stuxnet?
[12:10] <shadeslayer> KJ_agent007: well .. if you run a script with elevated priviliges only then will it have access to your system
[12:10] <shadeslayer> same thing
[12:10] <KJ_agent007> can those bypass firewalls?
[12:10] <shadeslayer> Linux is structured very differently
[12:10] <KJ_agent007> cool
[12:11] <KJ_agent007> is a firewall realln needed on a linux system?
[12:11] <shadeslayer> you have a firewall installed by default
[12:11] <shadeslayer> it's called ufw
[12:11] <KJ_agent007> yup
[12:12] <KJ_agent007> it loads up on startup
[12:25] <jjeronimo> pff I wrecked my audio config
[12:25] <jjeronimo> what is the easyest way to get the config file to the original state?
[12:26] <jjeronimo> /etc/pulse/daemon.conf
[12:26] <jjeronimo> forgot to make a backup :4
[12:26] <jjeronimo> :$
[12:28] <Peace-> jjeronimo: mm i guess reconfigure the package
[12:28] <Peace-> i think i am not sure btw
[12:30] <Peace-> jjeronimo: it's on pulseaudio package
[12:30] <jjeronimo> Peace-, k, thx I'll look into that
[12:32] <jjeronimo> nope dident help
[12:33] <Peace-> jjeronimo: i guess you should reinstall pulseaudio

[15:01] <cahyadi> Aknot: you can use import scheme from systemsettings ->colors
[15:01] <Aknot> which file do i have to import? it wouldnt let me choose the whole folder
[15:03] <cahyadi> Aknot: the file should look like this caledonia.colors
[15:03] <Aknot> and what about theme files, i cant import them
[15:04] <cahyadi> for theme file you can go to workspace appearance > desktop theme
[15:04] <Aknot> yes i downloaded workspace theme but i cant import it, there is no button for it, which folder do i have to put it in?
[15:06] <cahyadi> you can copied the folder after you untar it to /home/"username"/.kde/share/apps/desktoptheme/
[15:06] <cahyadi> or maybe .kde4

[15:31] <marsje> I have an application that needs me to draw a rectangle by holding down my mouse button. But when I do, I initiate a drag window operation. How can I turn off this feature? If I want to drag a window, I just want to do it by dragging the title bar.
[15:32] <Aknot> Whats a black desktop theme with no transluceny
[15:38] <apachelogger> marsje: systemsettings -> appearance -> style -> configure -> drag mode
[15:38] <apachelogger> also you may want to notify the author of the application
[15:39] <apachelogger> this feature of oxygen can be deactivated by application authors
[15:40] <marsje> apachelogger: I guess this happens when using a gtk app in kde?
[15:42] <marsje> apachelogger: I don't have that setting that you refer to. I have Application Appearance and Workspace Appearance
[15:42] <marsje> apachelogger: I have Application Appearance -> Style, but no configure or drag mode
[15:43] <apachelogger> marsje: if I am not mistaken it should not happen with gtk
[15:43] <marsje> apachelogger: I'm on kubuntu 12.10, KDE 4.9.4
[15:43] <apachelogger> though I may be wrong
[15:43] <marsje> apachelogger: it does :)
[15:43] <apachelogger> ah

[15:45] <simion314> hi all, did the last updates contained a new version of fglrx(the one that drops support for some older cards)? I am having some issues after i made the updates
[15:45] <marsje> apachelogger: I guess it depends on the widget style... behind that is a configure button, but it is grayed out. I don't have Oxygen in that list.
[15:46] <apachelogger> Oo
[15:46] <apachelogger> not having oxygen in that list seems, erm, wrong
[15:46] <apachelogger> marsje: is your gtk+ style oxygen?
[15:47] <marsje> apachelogger: looks like it
[15:48] <apachelogger> you'll probably need to change that, short of not having oxygen as a kde style listed (which is really weird, like really)

[16:25] <lordievader> Good afternoon
[16:25] <shadeslayer> Aknot: long standing issue
[16:31] <sbivol_> shadeslayer: I remember that issue since forever. what's the cause?
[16:32] <shadeslayer> dunno
[16:34] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: we should remove that or something
[16:38] <mandoguit> fwiw just try setting it here in my upgraded 12.04 -> 12.10 without any problems
[16:38] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: how does that stuff even work
[16:38] <shadeslayer> I mean
[16:38] <shadeslayer> is that something we add?
[16:38] <apachelogger> no
[16:38] <apachelogger> upstream thing
[16:38] <shadeslayer> oic, so fix it upstream?
[16:39] <apachelogger> and I do not remember how it is supposed to work exactly
[16:39] <shadeslayer> seems kind of useful
[16:39] <apachelogger> the code is a mess
[16:39] <shadeslayer> heh
[16:39] <apachelogger> that kcm is around since kde2
[16:39] <shadeslayer> like pgst ? :P
[16:39] <apachelogger> and has no dedicated maintainer
[16:39] <apachelogger> and that is exactly what the code looks like
[16:39] <apachelogger> anywho
[16:39] <shadeslayer> ...
[16:39] <apachelogger> to us the feature make next to no sense as we always timesync when a network connection is established
[16:39] <shadeslayer> oh
[16:40] <shadeslayer> I didn't know it setup NTP
[16:40] <shadeslayer> though I always suspected it did
[16:40] <apachelogger> so to have any value from continous syncing you'd have to have a broken hardware clock or houndreds of days of uptime
[16:40] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: let's remove after 4.10 final release?
[16:41] <apachelogger> or rewrite the KCM
[16:42] <apachelogger> also the option is bogus anyway
[16:42] <shadeslayer> blergh
[16:42] <sbivol_> shadeslayer: doesn't work at all in 4.10, so no one would notice it's missing if you remove it from 4.10.
[16:42] <apachelogger> what it really does is update time when you apply the changes
[16:42] <shadeslayer> sbivol_: *nod*
[16:43] <shadeslayer> sbivol_: and not needed as apachelogger mentioned
[16:43] <apachelogger> though it suggests it will continue to do so
[16:43] <shadeslayer> since it autosync's time
[16:43] <apachelogger> so that is really a one-time sync button and nothing more

[17:56] <mandoguit> Progers:   one way is to right click on the filename (ie   filename.txt) and then select Open With.    If you are presented with more than one option you can remove the association of any applications you don't want opening certain files by again right clicking on the application name and selecting "Remove Association"

[18:04] <Iridian> with tiled-window-selector I mean the feature where all my currently active applications in my workspace are tiled next to each other on the screen, and I can select one of them with my mouse to focus on that
[18:04] <Iridian> what's this feature called?
[18:08] <Iridian> okay, found the feature, it's called "Present Windows"

[18:08] <sbivol_> oh, you found it :)
[18:12] <Iridian> thanks. And I was able to disable it in System Settings -> Desktop Effects. Nice. Now I can work again. I suspect my laptop kbd is a bit faulty, and transmits special key signals which plasma interprets as a command to bring up that thing

[20:16] <Aknot> lordievader if i pause or rewind or anything the sound starts lagging behind video
[20:16] <LINKSWORD2> Guys, is there a way to hide a window, but keep it open in the background?
[20:16] <lordievader> Aknot: Isn't that a problem with VLC, instead of PA?
[20:16] <lordievader> LINKSWORD2: Minimize the window?
[20:17] <Aknot> lordievader they said its known bug with pa 2.0 and said to install 3.0
[20:17] <LINKSWORD2> It is minimized. I want it to be more hidden. lol
[20:17] <Aknot> linksword2 minimize to system tray?
[20:17] <LINKSWORD2> OK, let me put it this way. I'm using a program to tether with my phone for internet access. That program requires me to run it through the terminal.
[20:17] <LINKSWORD2> Yeah, Aknot. Any ideas how?
[20:18] <LINKSWORD2> I need to keep the terminal running, but I want it out of the way.
[20:18] <Aknot> check terminal settings, they sometimes have option to "minimize to system tray" if closed

[20:21] <yofel> heh
[20:21] <Aknot> trying vlc backend didnt help
[20:21] <Aknot> fuck its getting annoying
[20:22] <LINKSWORD2> When all else fails, shout Quassel. lol
[20:22] <yofel> install screen, open konsole and run 'screen'. In there run the application you need. Close konsole
[20:22] <yofel> the shell will stay open
[20:22] <yofel> just don't close konsole with ctrl+d
[20:23] <LINKSWORD2> sudo apt-get install screen  (correct???)
[20:23] <yofel> if you need to terminate the application open konsole again, run 'screen -r' to get the running shell again

[20:24] <LINKSWORD2> "unable to lock the download directory"
[20:24] <yofel> o.O

[20:25] <yofel> I last tried that like 3 years ago... didn't manage to get it to not use the full screen width
[20:26] <LINKSWORD2> That was interesting.
[20:26] <yofel> what happened? ^^
[20:26] <LINKSWORD2> Internet through phone. It dropped on me.
[20:27] <Tm_T> Aknot: please watch the language
[20:27] <yofel> ah, I feel with you...
[20:28] <LINKSWORD2> yofel: I initially tried to install Oneric, but the CD I had it written on isn't working properly. I'm using Maverick right now, and unfortunately, have to upgrade fully to the next major distro version.
[20:29] <yofel> any reason you didn't go with precise?
[20:29] <LINKSWORD2> I forget which version that is?
[20:29] <yofel> 12.04, maverick is 10.10
[20:29] <LINKSWORD2> !precise
[20:29] <ubottu> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) is the current !LTS release of Ubuntu.  Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1204
[20:29] <LINKSWORD2> !oneric
[20:29] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) was the fifteenth release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1110
[20:29] <LINKSWORD2> Ah.
[20:30] <LINKSWORD2> I don't have Precise available to me, although that's what I will be upgrading to, once the download finishes.
[20:31] <yofel> ah ok
[20:31] <yofel> in any case, welcome back :)
[20:31] <LINKSWORD2> Well, thank you.
[20:31] <LINKSWORD2> What came before Maverick?
[20:32] <LINKSWORD2> .... I feel so absent, not remembering some of this stuff.
[20:32] <yofel> lucid
[20:32] <LINKSWORD2> Aha, yes.
[20:33] <LINKSWORD2> Would you recommend upgrading from Maverick to Oneric, then to Precise, or can I jump-upgrade from Maverick to Precise?
[20:42] <LINKSWORD2> yofel: Would you recommend upgrading from Maverick to Oneric, then to Precise, or can I jump-upgrade from Maverick to Precise?
[20:44] <OerHeks> LINKSWORD2, you cannot jump-upgrade from Maverick to Precise, 10.10 > 11.04 > 11.10 > 12.04  or 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS
[20:45] <LINKSWORD2> OerHeks: It seems to be working.
[20:45] <OerHeks> I don' think so.
[20:47] <DarthFrog> LINKSWORD2:  How are you doing the upgrade?
[20:47] <LINKSWORD2> Once I got my internet connection available, I received a system notification that there was an upgrade available.
[20:47] <Aknot> I logged back and a message came to the screen. It said some pulseaudio output thing is not useful and if i wanted to disable it or something, i chose yes and now when i open movie with vlc this comes: Audio output failed:
[20:47] <Aknot> The audio device "pulse" could not be used:
[20:47] <Aknot> Connection refused.
[20:48] <Aknot> and i dont have sound
[20:48] <DarthFrog> LINKSWORD2:  You're probably upgrading to Natty.
[20:48] <LINKSWORD2> !natty
[20:48] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) was the fourteenth release of Ubuntu. !End-Of-Life on 2012-10-28, see http://ubottu.com/y/natty for details.
[20:48] <LINKSWORD2> Nope. It says version 12.04
[20:48] <DarthFrog> Good luck. :-)
[20:49] <LINKSWORD2> Right? lol
[20:49] <yofel> I'm not exactly sure what it'll do here, maverick and natty have reached EOL, so it might very well just upgrade to precise
[20:50] <yofel> (which isn't really supported, but oh well...)
[20:52] <LINKSWORD2> Why is Precise not really supported?
[20:53] <Aknot> anyone??? i think it deleted pulseaudio output
[20:54] <Aknot> and now its using hd audio and the kmix is completely different with different volume controls for everything
[20:54] <KimLaroux> leaving before I had time to reply
[20:54] <KimLaroux> way to go, champ
[20:55] <LINKSWORD2> KimLaroux: Who are/were you talking to?
[20:56] <KimLaroux> Aknot
[20:56] <Aknot> kimlaroux
[20:57] <KimLaroux> Aknot: what's the problem? pulseaudio is a piece of trash, so getting rid of it is the best thing you can do
[20:57] <Aknot> i dont have sound in vlc
[20:58] <Aknot> so how can i reset all the pulseaudio etc things
[20:59] <KimLaroux> Aknot: you have to configure VLC to send audio to the right device
[20:59] <Aknot> how
[20:59] <Aknot> i tried alsa dummy etc nothing works
[20:59] <Aknot> Audio output failed:
[20:59] <Aknot> The audio device "pulse" could not be used:
[20:59] <Aknot> Connection refused.
[20:59] <Aknot> it gives this when i start movie
[21:00] <KimLaroux> in "output module", just use Default
[21:00] <Aknot> and on the toolbar the audio device is grey and cant click it
[21:00] <Aknot> chose default still doesnt work
[21:01] <Aknot> i mean what kind of idiot designed the "hey you are not using this pulseaudio thing would you like to delete it"
[21:01] <Aknot> when in fact i do need it
[21:02] <LINKSWORD2> Aknot, whatever you do, don't choose dummy output...
[21:02] <LINKSWORD2> I tried that, and it stopped working entirely. After that, I found out various important files were missing and chose to re-install.
[21:02] <Aknot> why would it pop up right after login, it doesnt make any sense, like some microsoft employee trying to sabotage linux
[21:02] <KimLaroux> then show All settings, go under Audio, Output Module, ALSA, and change the output device to default
[21:02] <LINKSWORD2> ROFL
[21:04] <Aknot> kimlaroux u mean in vlc? i tried every one of those they dont work
[21:05] <KimLaroux> Seem like you deleted more than just pulseaudio then
[21:05] <Aknot> wonderful
[21:05] <Aknot> Message to whoever designed that popup: Kill yourself
[21:06] <KimLaroux> That should help you fix your problem
[21:07] <Aknot> it would give me pleasure
[21:08] <yofel> LINKSWORD2: bad wording: directly upgrading from maverick to precise isn't really supported
[21:08] <yofel> or rather untested
[21:08] <Aknot> So how do i reinstall pulseaudio
[21:12] <LINKSWORD2> I see. Well, I guess we will see.
[21:15] <KimLaroux> Aknot: sudo apt-get install pulseaudio
[21:17] <Aknot> kimlaroux it says i already have newest version
[21:17] <KimLaroux> then you didn't delete pulse
[21:18] <KimLaroux> is the problem from last boot, or did it persist after a reboot?
=== pete_ is now known as Guest58233
[21:22] <Aknot> i havent rebooted yet, only relogged
[21:25] <KimLaroux> try rebooting, the decives may reapear

[21:25] <KimLaroux> you can tell it never to ask again
