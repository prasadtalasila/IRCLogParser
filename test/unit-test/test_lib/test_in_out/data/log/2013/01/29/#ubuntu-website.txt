[10:43] <rsajdok> daker: thanks, I am trying to add "team event" and I got error message "You can not add a new team event. You are not a member of any LoCo Teams."
[10:43] <rsajdok> In past I could do that but now is not possible.
[11:13] <daker> rsajdok: in your local_settings there is a DEBUG_USERS, add your Launchpad nickname
[11:28] <rsajdok> daker: DEBUG_USERS = ('ris') ?

[11:32] <daker> i mean click on login at top right
[11:44] <rsajdok> daker: I did, still I can not add team event
[11:46] <daker> rsajdok: download this http://people.ubuntu.com/~daker/ltp/ltp.db
[11:48] <daker> run ./env/bin/python loco_directory/manage.py syncdb --noinput

[11:59] <daker> and add "admin" to DEBUG_USERS
[12:06] <rsajdok> daker: during login I am redirect to openid
[12:06] <daker> for /admin ?
[12:07] <daker> login to 127.0.0.1:8000/admin

[20:51] <daker> cjohnston: pong
[20:52] <cjohnston> daker: is there a plugin or something that josepht and I can use to view the dashboard in different resolutions?
[20:53] <cjohnston> someone else is seeing something that we arent with that page you and I were workign on
[20:53] <daker> cjohnston: yeah
[20:53] <daker> do you have chrome/ium ?
[20:54] <cjohnston> chrome
[20:54] <cjohnston> josepht: uses FF
[20:54] <josepht> cjohnston: I have one for FF :)
[20:54] <cjohnston> josepht, daker, daker josepht... josepht daker is the CSS/django master
[20:54] <josepht> daker: nice to meet you
[20:55] <daker> josepht: nice to meet you
[20:55] <daker> josepht: cjohnston  FF & chrome both have this feature
[20:57] <daker> josepht: for FF http://i.imgur.com/X74cuS5.png
[20:58] <rsajdok> cjohnston: latest firefox has that function
[21:00] <daker> cjohnston: for chrome press F12 once you have the developer tools click the small gear on the bottom right
[21:00] <daker> http://i.imgur.com/0oXrNa4.png
[21:01] <daker> you can overide useragent/device metrics/Lat/Long
[21:02] <cjohnston> josepht: I can't reproduce either
[21:03] <daker> cjohnston: what's your problem ?
[21:03] <cjohnston> daker: a layout problem on one persons screen
[21:03] <josepht> cjohnston: once i get the width to 1991 I see it too
[21:04] <cjohnston> wtf
[21:04] <josepht> cjohnston: grid_15 takes up its 1180px and grid_2 is beside it on the right
[21:05] <cjohnston> it shouldnt be
[21:05] <cjohnston> grid_15 should be taking the whole space
[21:06] <josepht> anyone know how to increase the resolution without the mouse? I can only add a few px at a time by clicking and dragging?
[21:06] <daker> josepht: http://i.imgur.com/X74cuS5.png
[21:06] <josepht> cjohnston: div#content doesn't have a width
[21:07] <josepht> daker: I got that, but it a pain getting larger than the largest preset width
[21:08] <daker> josepht: you can set your own preset
[21:08] <josepht> daker: I tried that and it just uses the current resolution
[21:10] <daker> ah you are right
[21:10] <josepht> ah I got it had to unmaximize the window and move it almost off the scren to the left
[21:12] <daker> josepht: ah got it, do you see the resize grip http://i.imgur.com/CQQEqMO.png ?
[21:13] <josepht> daker: yes
[21:13] <daker> josepht: it works for you ?
[21:14] <josepht> daker: yes, you just can't drag it very far when the FF window is maximized and the resolution is larger than the window size :)
[21:14] <daker> ok :)
[21:15] <josepht> cjohnston: adding the width to #content fixed it for me at high resolutions
[21:15] <josepht> daker: thanks a lot for your help
[21:16] <cjohnston> josepht: ok
[21:16] <cjohnston> I say we just tell her to get a normal resolution ;-)
[21:23] <rsajdok> daker: I did http://pastie.org/5946780 and still I can not add new team event
[21:24] <daker> rsajdok: i said DEBUG_USERS = ('admin')
