[09:34] <rperier> Hey, could someone merge https://code.launchpad.net/~rperier/unity/unity/+merge/143961 ?
[09:36] <sil2100> rperier: let me take a look
[09:37] <sil2100> rperier: oh, could you also set the commit message for the merge?
[09:38] <sil2100> rperier: this will be the message that will be essentially used when the branch gets approved
[09:39] <rperier> I did not set a commit message already ?
[09:39] <sil2100> rperier: no - there are actually two things, you have set the 'description of change'
[09:39] <sil2100> rperier: this thing is for explaining in detail what your branch does
[09:40] <sil2100> Besides this, you can click on "set commit message" and paste there the string that you want to be in trunk after this gets merged ;)
[09:40] <rperier> ohhh directly from LP ?
[09:40] <rperier> it rocks :D
[09:40] <sil2100> Also, what we can do to make this merge more interesting is linking it to a bug
[09:40] <rperier> mhhh I understand, ok
[09:40] <sil2100> rperier: yes, since your branch can have more than one commits in it that you want to merge
[09:41] <rperier> nice :)
[09:41] <sil2100> rperier: I think #1086276 could be linked to your branch, right?
[09:41] <sil2100> LP: #1086276
[09:41] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1086276 in Unity "lp:unity FTBFS on quantal: error: ‘bamf_view_is_user_visible’ was not declared in this scope " [High,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086276
[09:42] <sil2100> rperier: once you add a commit message and link the right bug to the branch, I'll approve it globally and LP will merge it automatically
[09:43] <sil2100> rperier: when we link a branch to a bug and the branch gets merged, LP will automatically add a 'Fixes #bugnumber' to the commit message
[09:43] <sil2100> rperier: which helps in having it all sorted up
[09:45] <rperier> sil2100: yeah 1086276 is the right bug
[09:45] <rperier> mhhh LP does a lot of interesting things for us :)
[09:48] <rye> Hi, me again. I have connected my laptop (Intel HD 3000) to an external display (1920x1080) and (as I originally complained) dash blurred fading in current raring starts being uncomfortable (bug 1099787). But now I am trying to use previews in the fullscreen dash and the animation for shifting the rows, drawing the overlay, showing some content takes 3 seconds to complete (and feels reeeaaallly slow. In "restored" state - less than 1) - is it known or
[09:48] <rye>  that's for another bug report. I am fairly sure that the amount of animation done does not change but it feels like it struggles redrawing full screen.
[09:48] <ubot5> bug 1099787 in unity (Ubuntu) "Dash blur is too slow to fade in. Please don't fade it." [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099787
[09:49] <rperier> I don't understand how to link a bug to this merge request :\
[09:50] <sil2100> rperier: you can do it in two ways
[09:51] <sil2100> rperier: you can either do it through the bug, e.g. go into the bug and click 'Link a related branch'
[09:51] <sil2100> rperier: or you can open your branch (not the merge request, but the page for your branch) and click 'Link a bug report' ;)
[09:52] <rperier> mhhh I see
[09:52] <rperier> thanks for these details , looking
[09:54] <rperier> sil2100: done
[10:03] <sil2100> rperier: approved, thanks!
[10:21] <rperier> sil2100: thanks !!
[10:28] <didrocks> hey mmrazik, good flight back?
[10:32] <MCR1> didrocks: Hi :) I've set a few Severity Compiz bug reports to invalid - they were correctly reporting possible divisions by zero, but CCSM already protected these variables from not becoming 0...
[10:33] <MCR1> didrocks: But I guess Severity will continue to report them, so I am not sure if it was the ideal solution
[10:33] <MCR1> *Coverity
[10:33] <MCR1> not Severity :)
[10:33] <didrocks> MCR1: not really sure, I think tedg and mmrazik are more up to date than I was ever be on the binding reporting the bugs :)
[10:33] <didrocks> MCR1: so maybe check with them before invalidating?
[10:35] <MCR1> mmrazik, was this the right decision or should we better fix those in another way ? ^^
[10:35] <MCR1> didrocks, thx 4 the fast answer :)
[10:35] <didrocks> MCR1: yw ;)
[10:36] <MCR1> The coverity reports are very useful, btw.
[10:37] <MCR1> Should improve code quality massively once all of them are fixed...
[10:40] <MCR1> I guess Unity/nux could use such Coverity reports as well, guess those are planned ?
[10:57] <rperier> sil2100: mhhh so it's approved by the unity team and pushed into lp:unity by a jenkins bot ?
[11:00] <sil2100> rperier: it should get auto-merged pretty soon
[11:01] <sil2100> rperier: actually, normally it should have been merged already, but maybe the merging queue is full? Or something is broken? We'll see in a while
[11:04] <didrocks> sil2100: there is a compiz branch not merging as well
[11:04] <didrocks> approved since 7am
[11:04] <didrocks> hence my ping to mmrazik, but he seems not being around
[11:06] <MCR1> sampo555 fixed a very important grid bug on the weekend, btw
[11:06] <MCR1> grid is starting to get usable now :)
[11:06] <sil2100> didrocks: oh, ok, then something indeed is broken
[11:06] <sil2100> mmrazik: 2x ping
[11:08] <mmrazik> srry guys
[11:08] <mmrazik> looking on the compiz branch
[11:08] <didrocks> sil2100: waow, a 2x ping is more powerful than a 1x ping it seems! :-)
[11:08] <mmrazik> for some reason all connections to launchpad were stuck this morning
[11:08] <MCR1> hehe
[11:08] <mmrazik> didrocks: I've seen the first one but it didn't seem to be urgent ;)
[11:08] <mmrazik> 2x does indeed sound more urgent :)
[11:09] <mmrazik> MCR1: I'll come back to you with the coverity stuff later but it should be fine to close as wontfix.
[11:09] <mmrazik> I'm just wondering if there is a way in coverity to avoid reporting such issues and whitelist them
[11:09] <MCR1> mmrazik: that would indeed be cool
[11:10] <MCR1> as otherwise they will come back probably ;)
[11:10] <rperier> sil2100: It was just a question to know the way it works usually :)
[11:10] <rperier> there's no hurry :)
[11:10] <MCR1> but ofc those division by zero ones could be fixed in Compiz also, but as I said those values are already protected by the xml.in definitions
[11:11] <didrocks> mmrazik: ahah :)
[11:11] <didrocks> mmrazik: well, it needs to be merged before noon UTC
[11:11] <didrocks> mmrazik: as long as it's dealt today, it's fine :)
[11:11] <MCR1> mmrazik: and there might be a lot of other false positives, so it would be cool if we could mark them as such once and for all
[11:12] <mmrazik> MCR1: yeah.. there is a way. I just need to talk with alesage who knows more about how this sort of stuff is done.
[11:12] <mmrazik> MCR1: and I just realized there are public holidays in US today
[11:12] <mmrazik> MCR1: so I guess I'll just drop him an e-mail and ping you tomorrow-ish
[11:12] <MCR1> ok, cool - no hurry -> just a thought of optimization ;)
[11:14] <mmrazik> didrocks: btw. is there really a stalled branch?
[11:14] <mmrazik> I don't see anything
[11:14] <MCR1> mmrazik: Last q: will unity also get under Coverity testing ?
[11:15] <mmrazik> MCR1: ack. Its in the process. We need some help from coverity helpdesk.
[11:15] <MCR1> cool
[11:15] <mmrazik> sometimes its tricky to get anything out of coverity :-/
[11:15] <MCR1> +1
[11:15] <MCR1> the info extracted seems quite useful though ;)
[11:16] <didrocks> mmrazik: well, not movement from 6h, right?
[11:16] <didrocks> 5h
[11:16] <didrocks> I meant
[11:16] <mmrazik> didrocks: still don't see anything.
[11:17] <mmrazik> didrocks: it was probably stuck due to the launchpad network issue in the morning
[11:17] <mmrazik> and then it takes ~3h to build on arm...
[11:17] <didrocks> ok
[11:17] <didrocks> let's see then
[11:19] <mmrazik> didrocks: but I still don't see any branch waiting to be merged for compiz
[11:19] <mmrazik> didrocks: do you refer to a specific MP?
[11:19] <didrocks> one sec
[11:20] <didrocks> mmrazik: just finished to merge 10 minutes ago, and just got the email
[11:20] <mmrazik> ok
[11:20] <mmrazik> sil2100: pong btw
[11:20] <didrocks> mmrazik: so everything's fine here, was just long, probably due to this launchpad hickup
[11:20] <didrocks> thanks for checking
[11:22] <mmrazik> didrocks: yeah... srry for that.
[11:25] <didrocks> no worry ;)
[11:26] <sil2100> mmrazik: ;)

[13:44] <sil2100> rperier: so it seems, but hm, not sure if it will be as easy as it seems ;)
[13:51] <rperier> I could try, no ? what do you think ? except if this bug is really hard to fix for a beginner... :)
[13:52] <sil2100> rperier: you could look into it, I think it could be done with some workaround quite easily
[13:52] <sil2100> (I hope so at least!)
[13:53] <rperier> I will do my best  :)

[17:08] <rperier> sil2100: If I want to focus a specific window (which is already opened) I need to use bamf or there is a module in unity for this case ?
=== dandrader is now known as dandrader|afk
=== dandrader|afk is now known as dandrader
[17:50] <sil2100> rperier: I think bamf is the safest bet
[17:51] <sil2100> rperier: since in the case of the trash, it's a bit more complicated
[17:51] <sil2100> rperier: you can ask the launcher about the running applications as well, but when the trash is started, it's acutally identified as a normal nautilus window
[17:52] <rperier> mhhh I see
[17:53] <rperier> so focus the trash might focus "Documents" for example...
[17:53] <rperier> it's not possible to detect the title of the window or its location or something ... ?
[17:58] <sil2100> rperier: depends on what exactly you need - each running application in unity, which has an ApplicationWindow assigned has the title() property which can be used in a way
