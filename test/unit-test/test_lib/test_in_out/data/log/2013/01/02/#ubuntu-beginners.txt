[00:56] <thewrath> hey all
[02:18] <thewrath> holstein: you still around sir?
[02:19] <holstein> thewrath: yup...
[02:28] <thewrath> holstein: the issue was that the virtual host declaration needed to be *:80 instead of melandchris13.com:80
[02:29] <holstein> interesting...
[02:29] <holstein> glad you got that sorted
[02:45] <xorg> lost my screen resolution on headless 12.04. wont start up. freezes in ubuntu splash screen
[02:45] <holstein> xorg: its headless?
[02:46] <xorg> i have to have a monitor. to start now. yes (no monitor)
[02:48] <xorg> trying to modify my xorg.conf file but i can't decipher my /var/log/Xorg.0.log for the video driver that is loading
[02:48] <holstein> xorg: i would remove the xorg.conf
[02:49] <holstein> !tty
[02:49] <ubot2> To get to the TTY terminals 1-6, use the keystroke ctrl + alt + F1-F6 respectively (Alt+F7 will get you back to your graphical login).  To change the resolution for your TTY, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ChangeTTYResolution
[02:49] <holstein> if you can get to tty, go there and install ssh, and unhook the monitor :)
[02:54] <xorg> grub>
[02:58] <xorg> GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX1=1024x768
[02:59] <xorg> ssh works, had it set up, did'nt understand that
[03:00] <holstein> xorg: ? that being ssh?
[03:02] <xorg> yes, it freezes in splash screen (i know because i hook up the moniter when i cant log in with vlc) but i can still acces my shared files
[03:02] <xorg> vnc*
[03:03] <holstein> xorg: and when you removed the xorg.conf file?
[03:04] <holstein> i didnt know you were doing headless VNC.. i was thinking just ssh
[03:05] <xorg> yes, i havent set all my drives to load on start up
[03:06] <holstein> xorg: your drives?.. i wouldnt do that til you get the x forwarding going on
[03:06] <xorg> so i need to access via vnc to open( just havent set it up yet) i need to acces other things aswell
[03:06] <holstein> xorg: you know, you can do that? from a headless box not running x, you can forward x via ssh
[03:06] <holstein> xorg: if you want a vnc connection, do it.. you dont need it though
[03:07] <holstein> xorg: how is the machine starting up with the xorg.conf removed or renamed?
[03:07] <holstein> xorg: if you are talking with another volunteer in another channel, i'll just wait til you need something more from me. cheers
[03:07] <xorg> hold on, im still writing down info on grub>
[03:08] <holstein> ?
[03:08] <holstein> !grub
[03:08] <ubot2> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[03:08] <holstein> i would run sudo update-grub and see that no errors post
[03:09] <holstein> theres also the recovery kernels
[03:09] <xorg> folowing ubot2 advice
[03:09] <xorg> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ChangeTTYResolution
[03:10] <holstein> xorg: ubot2 is a bot..  you dont need to change the tty res.. thats just tty
[03:10] <holstein> i suggested tty when i thought you were wanting a headless server not running x
[03:10] <xorg> realized that as i typed the name,duuu
[03:10] <holstein> either way, you dont need to change the resolution on a tty
[03:11] <holstein> xorg: you need to rename or remove that xorg.conf, and reboot and report
[03:11] <xorg> ok
[03:11] <holstein> xorg: i would just rename it to xorg.backup1 or whatever
[03:12] <xorg> i can just get rid of it, i will copy it first
[03:13] <holstein> xorg: sure... go around about it how ever you like... renaming it in place is the easiest and best since its easy and best and backs it up and gets it out of the way.. but do your thing
[03:13] <xorg> gksudo nautilus
[03:13] <holstein> nah
[03:13] <xorg> why not
[03:13] <xorg> sudo rm -rf xxxxxxxx
[03:13] <holstein> xorg: a better question is why?
[03:14] <xorg> ok why?
[03:14] <holstein> thats my question to you actually.. why risk running the gui file manager as root when you can just sudo mv the file to a new nam
[03:14] <holstein> name*
[03:15] <holstein> xorg: do what you like.. i dont run the file manager as root unless absolutely necessary
[03:15] <holstein> whatever tricky clicky silly thing you do with the mouse can really break the system.. could make it not want to boot past the loading screen (if you know what i mean)
[03:16] <xorg> got ya
[03:16] <xorg> ok what about the xorg.conf.dist-upgrade-XXXXXXXX file?
[03:17] <holstein> xorg: if it doesnt say "xorg.conf" its not being used as an xorg.conf
[03:18] <holstein> sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.backup1
[03:19] <xorg> what abot the xorg.conf~
[03:19] <holstein> xorg: if it doesnt say "xorg.conf" its not being used as an xorg.conf
[03:19] <holstein> xorg: you seem to have a lot of backups there..
[03:19] <xorg> there are 3 xorg.conf ~ and backup
[03:20] <holstein> xorg: what would i do? rename the current one and try booting without
[03:20] <holstein> xorg: i would want to do it from the command line since that it the easiest way to fix it if it wont boot.. but you can do it from a live CD
[03:21] <xorg> ok re booting
[03:23] <xorg> didn't enplane myself well enough, 3 files all xorg.conf
[03:23] <xorg> i got rid of them all
[03:23] <holstein> xorg: i *never* said get rid of anything.. for the record
[03:24] <holstein> xorg: i would back them up and have them on hand.. but there is a recovery kernel.. a graphics recovery option
[03:24] <xorg> thats ok with the monitor on i now have 1024x768
[03:25] <holstein> probably just fine for forwarding
[03:25] <xorg> know, will it noot the ssame with out the moniter or do i have to adjust the /etc/default grub
[03:25] <xorg> boot*
[03:26] <holstein> xorg: i dont know your hardware.. i would setup the VNC server you are using, and test that.. with the monitor connected. i would reboot with the monitor connected and test that the vnc server is working as expected
[03:26] <holstein> then i would boot without the monitor
[03:27] <xorg> it works with, testing now without
[03:28] <holstein> you should be able to set the resolution with the GUI.. the display gui
[03:30] <xorg> locked in ubuntu with the 5 dots below it splash screen
[03:31] <holstein> xorg: ?
[03:31] <holstein> xorg: when?
[03:31] <holstein> xorg: did you reboot with the monitor plugged in?
[03:31] <xorg> on start up the screen that says ubuntu wth the 5 red dots below
[03:32] <xorg> did not have moniter pluged in
[03:32] <holstein> xorg: im familiar with the graphic.. im just not sure in which case you are "locked" in it
[03:32] <holstein> xorg: then how are you seeing that?
[03:32] <holstein> xorg: a vnc client?
[03:32] <holstein> xorg: disconnect and reconnect via VNC
[03:33] <xorg> after i wait a min on restart i try to reconnect with vnc
[03:33] <xorg> says unable to connect
[03:33] <holstein> xorg: wait a bit longer..
[03:33] <xorg> then try a gain a couple times
[03:33] <holstein> xorg: after disconnecting and reconnecting, what do you see?
[03:34] <holstein> xorg: plug the monitor back in and test again
[03:34] <xorg> same thing unable to connect error message
[03:34] <holstein> xorg: what error message?
[03:34] <holstein> xorg: i have *never* seen you post *any* error message
[03:34] <xorg> i plug the moniter in and im frozen at the ubuntu screen
[03:35] <holstein> xorg: i think this is unrelated
[03:35] <xorg> the error message when vnc cannot connect
[03:35] <holstein> xorg: i would test the machine. i would test the ram.. test and fsck the hard drive
[03:35] <xorg> info it is a dell dimension 2400
[03:36] <xorg> this is a know issue i guess
[03:36] <holstein> xorg: i dont think so
[03:36] <holstein> xorg: if the vnc server is running.. then it'll connect
[03:36] <holstein> xorg: if you plug the monitor back in, then it should be the same as it was 10 minutes ago when it was boting
[03:36] <holstein> booting*
[03:37] <xorg> ok, what first?
[03:37] <holstein> xorg: this is *not* a known issue, unless you have a bug #
[03:37] <holstein> xorg: i would test the ram.. then the hard drive.. then fsck.. then go from there
[03:37] <holstein> xorg: if it boots with a monitor plugged in and has no issues,, just leave a monitor plugged into it
[03:38] <xorg> lol
[03:38] <holstein> xorg: i dont think the monitor is the issue
[03:38] <holstein> xorg: i think you have some other issue going on
[03:38] <xorg> ok,
[03:38] <xorg> i have had this problem for a while
[03:39] <holstein> if it were my box, i would put a different hard drive in, and quickly install 12.04 32bit and test
[03:39] <holstein> xorg: when everything is fine with that, you can consider a fresh install
[03:39] <xorg> it freezes on start up with no moniter
[03:39] <holstein> xorg: i dont think so
[03:39] <xorg> i have tried a fressh install same thing
[03:39] <holstein> xorg: i think it freezes sometimes on startup
[03:39] <holstein> xorg: you have a monitor hooked up, correct/ and its frozed?
[03:40] <xorg> every time
[03:40] <holstein> frozen*
[03:40] <holstein> xorg: ?
[03:40] <xorg> with out the moniter
[03:40] <holstein> xorg: no.. you said you hooked the monotir back up and it froze
[03:40] <holstein> correct?
[03:40] <xorg> sorry, no
[03:40] <xorg> only freezes without the moniter
[03:41] <holstein> xorg: so, leave the monitor plugged in
[03:41] <xorg> lol
[03:41] <holstein> xorg: i feeel confident this is a config issue, but soon you will not want X there anyway
[03:42] <holstein> xorg: i would check the hardware... check for a bios halt
[03:43] <holstein> xorg: try the vesa driver forced in an xorg.conf
[03:43] <xorg> yes, i have adjusted the /etc/default/grub to work around this freezing problem
[03:43] <holstein> ?
[03:43] <holstein> xorg: you also have *never* said that
[03:43] <xorg> trying to find source
[03:43] <xorg> sorry, lot of info
[03:43] <holstein> xorg: if you hae adjusted around the freezing problem, it woudnt be a problem
[03:44] <holstein> xorg: undo whatever you have done to grub
[03:44] <holstein> xorg: open a terminal.. and type 'sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[03:44] <holstein> copy and paste this in there http://paste.ubuntu.com/1487104/
[03:44] <holstein> reboot and test
[03:45] <xorg> ok
[03:46] <holstein> xorg: if you dont feel comfortable with nano, use gksudo gedit
[03:47] <xorg> got it, im not the fastest with typing
[03:52] <holstein> xorg: i wouldnt type that in
[03:53] <holstein> xorg: i would copy/paste it.. via ssh or whatever
[03:53] <xorg> got ya
[03:54] <xorg> reeboitng now
[03:55] <xorg> with monitor not hooked up
[03:55] <holstein> xorg: i would test with first
[03:55] <xorg> ok
[03:55] <holstein> but, whatever.. i feel good about it
[03:55] <holstein> im just saying, dont troubleshoot 2 things at once
[03:56] <xorg> got ya
[03:58] <xorg> running in low graphics mode
[03:58] <xorg> no mouse no keyboard
[03:58] <holstein> xorg: vesa *is* low graphics mode
[03:59] <holstein> xorg: i would reboot without the monitor, then you'll konw if its something you need to explore
[03:59] <xorg> im stuck on (what would you like to do)
[03:59] <holstein> xorg: ?
[03:59] <holstein> xorg: reboot with the monitor unplugged
[03:59] <xorg> dialog box
[03:59] <holstein> ?
[04:00] <holstein> thats the recovery kernel
[04:00] <holstein> xorg: i dont know what you have done to grub to make it boot the recovery kernel
[04:00] <holstein> xorg: if you broke that, thats not in this scenario
[04:00] <xorg> no prob
[04:00] <holstein> xorg: i would reboot with the monitor connected.. tap or hold shift and make sure you are booting the proper kernel
[04:00] <holstein> *not* the recovery one you are in
[04:01] <xorg> this is my 3 clean ubuntu 12.04 install
[04:01] <holstein> xorg: is it?
[04:01] <holstein> xorg: you said you messed with grub? did you not?
[04:01] <holstein> xorg: that makes it not clean
[04:01] <xorg> firs and second time
[04:01] <holstein> xorg: what i am asking you to do is to make sure you are *not* booting a recovery kernel
[04:01] <xorg> first*
[04:01] <holstein> xorg: test that xorg.conf
[04:02] <holstein> i think if you do a fresh install, and put that xorg.conf in place, all will be well
[04:03] <holstein> but, youcan just undo what you did to grub
[04:03] <xorg> i have changed grub in the past.
[04:03] <xorg> to make it so i could start it up
[04:04] <holstein> ?
[04:04] <holstein> to make what so you could start what? when was the past? and what are you talking about? grub?
[04:04] <holstein> you shouldnt have to touch grub.. it boots the os.. if its booting then its booting..
[04:05] <holstein> if you changed it, change it back, or explain to me why it was changed
[04:05] <holstein> othwerwise, it seems you have grub booting a recovery kernel by default
[04:05] <xorg> yes, i have adjusted the /etc/default/grub to work around this freezing problem
[04:06] <holstein> xorg: if you had then it wouldnt be freezing
[04:06] <holstein> xorg: you have *not* adjustd grub to work around the freezing problem.. or you wouldnt be here, correct?
[04:06] <xorg> it wasent
[04:06] <holstein> ?
[04:06] <holstein> what wasnt what?
[04:06] <holstein> xorg: please do *not* type "it" anymore
[04:07] <holstein> xorg: im having a challening time keeping yup
[04:07] <holstein> up*
[04:07] <xorg> coldent fix the starting in 800x400
[04:07] <xorg> im trying to find the notes of what it was i changed in grub
[04:08] <holstein> xorg: i would fresh install and try the xorg.conf i gave
[04:08] <holstein> xorg: good luck!
[04:10] <xorg> im not getting it whit a fresh install
[04:10] <xorg> with*
[04:10] <xorg> same problem every time
=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[04:13] <holstein> xorg: im not understanding you
[04:14] <holstein> xorg: when you say "im not getting it with a fresh install" "same problem everytime"
[04:14] <holstein> i dont know what "it" is.. and it looks like you are not getting the same problem everytime.. correct?
[04:15] <holstein> in that case, i would think it could be ram.. i would test the ram and the hard drive, and look in the bios and make sure that all is as you'd expect
[04:15] <holstein> i would reinstall and *first* put my xorg.conf in place and test
[04:15] <holstein> dont mess with grub or x or *anything*
[04:20] <xorg> i understand, i am trying to find my notes so i can explane it
[04:39] <xorg> while searching for notes. i tried restarting and it works
[04:39] <xorg> loged in vnc
[04:39] <xorg> restarted using vnc
[04:39] <holstein> that xorg.conf should sort you out, assuming there are no settings in the bios halting it
[04:40] <xorg> and 1024x764 res
[04:40] <holstein> 768*
[04:40] <xorg> i went threw bios
[04:40] <xorg> couldent find any thing diffrent than the other one
[04:41] <xorg> problem on dell dimension 2400
[04:41] <xorg> one that works dell dimension 3000
[04:41] <xorg> same every thing
[04:42] <holstein> xorg: i doubt that.. even if you had 2 dimension 2400's, the hardware could be different
[04:42] <xorg> i want to say what i changed i grub was added  a word  nomodeprobe
[04:44] <xorg> spoke to soon
[04:44] <xorg> froze on startup
[04:57] <xorg> i will have topick it up later im out of time
[10:15] <philipballew> Best way to track down a memory leak?

[13:31] <Guest82804> trying to get my optical drive to work again, it's recognized in bios and kernel but I get lost after that
[13:32] <Guest82804> sorry, running 10.04
[14:07] <holstein> Guest82804: i would try a live CD on it.. take the operating system out of the equation
[14:07] <holstein> Guest82804: if a live CD boots in the drive, then you know its good
[14:08] <Guest82804> Live cd does boot
[14:09] <holstein> Guest82804: then boot the OS, and put a CD in and open the file manager
[14:11] <Guest82804> cd/dvd drive shows in file manager but there is no result when I double click or try to open
[14:11] <holstein> Guest82804: is there a CD in there? is it a known good CD? try different media..
[14:12] <Guest82804> it is good, it's the latest UBCD that I use
[14:12] <holstein> sure, but that a bootable distro
[14:13] <holstein> what do you expect to happen when you double click a bootable distro?.. i would put in a known good audio cd and see if you can get it playing
[14:13] <Guest82804> are you saying then like a commercial cd or dvd? I don't even get another file manager window when clicking
[14:14] <holstein> Guest82804: im saing a CD that might do something.. a data CD.. anything else really .. could be an audio cd you made, or something sitting around
[14:14] <Guest82804> in the past I've gotten an auto open prompt or file view
[14:14] <holstein> Guest82804: what files? its a CD
[14:14] <holstein> Guest82804: its a bootable cd.. its not going to show files.. though it might
[14:15] <holstein> Guest82804: what operating system are you using?
[14:15] <Guest82804> it has in the past.... 10.04
[14:15] <holstein> Guest82804: ubuntu? lubuntu? xubuntu? 32bit? 64?
[14:15] <Guest82804> sorry, 32bit ubuntu 10.04
[14:16] <holstein> so, nautilus is showing the UBCD.. but no files?
[14:16] <Guest82804> not even
[14:16] <holstein> not even what?
[14:16] <holstein> Guest82804: what does an audio CD do?
[14:16] <Guest82804> disc goes in, and nothing. same with audio cd or dvd
[14:16] <holstein> one that you didnt make.. one that works on something else as sell.. as i suggested above, a known good audio cd..
[14:17] <holstein> Guest82804: i would look into auto mountint.. maybe you have disabled that
[14:17] <holstein> mounting*
[14:17] <Guest82804> yes, commercial audio cd's and dvd's, I get nothing
[14:17] <holstein> Guest82804: cool
[14:17] <holstein> Guest82804: i can sense and relate to your frustration
[14:18] <holstein> Guest82804: if you can get a live CD to boot the machine from that same optical drive, then i think its safe to assume the drive is good
[14:18] <Guest82804> so automounting.. is that mucking with fstab?
[14:18] <holstein> Guest82804: no.. automounting in nautilus
[14:18] <holstein> Guest82804: i wouldnt add removable media to fstab
[14:18] <holstein> nor would i "muck about"
[14:19] <holstein> i would look for and apply any upgrades.. reboot and test
[14:19] <holstein> i would consider just upgrading to 12.04 if you have any other problems, since 10.04 is EOL soon anyway
[14:19] <Guest82804> hehe, mucking, said casually. I'd definitely look into what I was going to do before I "mucked"
[14:19] <holstein> you can try 12.04 live from USB and test the optical drive, though i think you are proably just not mounting the CD's
[14:20] <Guest82804> I have tried mounting from terminal, with no luck
[14:20] <holstein> Guest82804: what errors?
[14:20] <holstein> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1468035 might be relevant
[14:21] <holstein> ^^ actually suggests mucking about with fstab ;) ..but removing the crom from it
[14:22] <Guest82804> mount command says sdc0 not found in fstab or mtab

[14:23] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 562092 in udev (Ubuntu) "Cdrom drive not recognized automatically" [Undecided,Invalid]
[14:24] <holstein> Guest82804: you have upgraded? and have the latest kernel?
[14:24] <Guest82804> 2.6.32-45 kernel
[14:25] <Guest82804> bug link says something about latest udev?
[14:25] <holstein> Guest82804: well, without me having to do any googling, or booting up any old 10.04 boxes, look for and apply upgrades
[14:25] <holstein> sudo apt-get update, then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[14:26] <holstein> that should get you the latest udev, and you can test with that
[14:26] <Guest82804> everything shows up to date
[14:26] <holstein> what would i do? just boot up 12.04 from usb and test, and go ahead and upgrade since 10.04 is EOL soon
[14:27] <holstein> otherwise, its just going to be troubleshooting and testing til you sort out what is broken
[14:27] <holstein> i might just make a new user and test there, taking your /home config out of the equation
[14:27] <Guest82804> maybe not so odd question, would setting up nfs have messed up any automounting?
[14:28] <holstein> Guest82804: depends... you can try the 10.04 live from use to test as well
[14:28] <holstein> gotta run.. good luck! ..you can try #ubuntu for that if its dead in here.. cheers
