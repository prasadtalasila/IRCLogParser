[10:52] <rigved> hi everyone.
[10:53] <ogra_> jodh, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519386/ no issues with my ureadahead logs
[10:55] <rigved> i want to use the full space on my nexus 7 32GB in raring. but due to size limitation of flashing userdata, i am unable to do so using the 27G userdata image. Tasssadar yesterday suggested that i should just copy the root.tar.gz file to /data. can anyone tell me how to do that?
[10:55] <jodh> ogra_: thanks for info.
[10:56] <ogra_> jodh, note that this was only fixed very recently by a kernel patch and config change for the nxus7
[10:56] <ogra_> (last week)
[10:58] <jodh> ogra_: what was happening before?
[10:58] <ogra_> ureadahead exiting, the sysfs files it wants to read were missing
[10:58]  * ogra_ got the famous "exited with status 5" message on every boot :)
[11:00] <jodh> ogra_: ok, thanks.
[11:01] <ogra_> i dont think it is related in any way to your bug
