[16:58] <knome> bluesabre, ochosi, micahg, mr_pouit, ...
[16:58] <knome> ^ 
[16:58] <knome> zequence, studio too ^
[17:02] <micahg> umm...almost forgot
[17:02] <knome> :)
[17:02] <knome> me too... i was online by accident
[17:02] <pleia2> I probably should have sent a reminder email yesterday or something
[17:03] <maddernick> i thought it was a release meeting :D
[17:14] <pleia2> knome: need to nudge someone to send testing instructions (what shiny new thing should we test this week?) to the list
[17:15] <pleia2> I should probably do some testing, but don't have time to hunt people down to figure out what needs to be tested ;)
[17:16] <knome> i'm going to send an email
[17:16] <knome> i've already gathered a list, gotten emails from sean and stuff
[17:16] <knome> so it's pending on my todo
[17:16] <pleia2> great
[17:16] <pleia2> was it parole that also could use soem testing?
[17:17] <knome> that too, yep
[17:17] <pleia2> knowing what to test it on (quantal? raring?) and quick instructions for where the ppa is (or is it included in raring?) would be good
[17:17] <knome> definitely.
[17:18] <knome> i'll try to write instructions anybody can follow
[17:18] <knome> we probably want to test things on raring, but i don't think it hurts to test in quantal too
[17:22] <bluesabre_> did I miss the meeting already
[17:22] <bluesabre_> ?
[17:23] <knome> nope, we're still kind of on
