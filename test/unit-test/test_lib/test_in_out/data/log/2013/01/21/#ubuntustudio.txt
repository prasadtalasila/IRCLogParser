[05:33] <contrapunctus> Hey folks...it's finally that time when I can stop entering notes by VMPK and edit velocity by mouse -_- Any 25 key MIDI keyboard that doesn't cost more than USD 200, break down soon, or have any incompatibilities with Linux?
[13:29] <udog> hi,I have ubuntu studio 12.04,and use ardour.It freezes when exporting to an audiofilemIve read Im not the only case.Will upgrading to ubuntustuio 12.10 solve this?Thanks
[13:32] <zequence> udog: It depends more on the version of ardour.
[13:32] <zequence> udog: Or, the version of the libraries it depends on (don't know anything about that bug though)
[13:33] <udog> Its ardour 2.8.12
[13:33] <zequence> udog: Actually, it might depend on one of the plugins
[13:34] <zequence> udog: Try exporting something without any active plugins
[13:34] <zequence> udog: Some info here http://ardour.org/node/5363
[13:35] <udog>  <zequence>I have trued exporting specific audiotracks with no plugins.The same thing
[13:35] <zequence> ok
[13:36] <zequence> udog: Do you have multiple audio devices?
[13:37] <udog> <zequence>,no,in fact im using the built in device,crappy,I know
[13:37] <zequence> udog: Just a shot in the dark, but, is it some kind of realtime export you are doing?
[13:38] <zequence> Meaning, is it exporting in time, just as if you were playing the track
[13:38] <udog> Realtime is tagged,but tried untagging and setting jack to a higher latency.Worked onece,but not anymore.
[13:38] <udog> <zequence>Realtime is tagged,but tried untagging and setting jack to a higher latency.Worked onece,but not anymore.
[13:39] <zequence> udog: I wasn't referring to the realtime tag. Please use it, cause it makes audio much more reliable
[13:39] <zequence> A higher latency is preferred
[13:39] <zequence> udog: Actually, the default settings are the most reliable
[13:40] <zequence> Or, reliable enough
[13:40] <udog> <zequence>no,then its not a realtime export
[13:40] <udog> <zequence> ,sorry,have to leave.Thanks.Will chime in later,thanx
[13:41] <zequence> udog: I can't find anything more that could explain your issue. Let me try exporting something. Tell me, what samplerate did you record in, and what did you export to?
[14:39] <jorin91> Hello i hope there is someone who has some time to help me ?
[14:39] <jorin91> after some updates my cable internet and my wifi doesnt work anymore, they cant connect, my router does communicate with my pc which i can see at the lights of my router.
[14:41] <jorin91> So i really hope that someone here have some time to help me.
[14:47] <zequence> jorin91: What OS and which release?
[14:48] <zequence> And, just to make sure, is it a Desktop PC, or a laptop?
[14:51] <zequence> bbl
[14:56] <jorin91> its a desktop with ubuntu studio 12.04 tls
[14:57] <jorin91> it always worked find until yesterday
[14:57] <jorin91> if managed to use sudo hdhclient eth0 it worked for 1 time.
[14:58] <jorin91> * i managed to use sudo dhclient eth0
[15:00] <jorin91> my onboard network card is installed properly, at my cable it stays looping to connect, after a 20 seconds it says "lost connection on cable". My wireless does domething else, it also loops to connect but asks me the password again every loop. wich i am sure it is correct, my windows 8 is connected with same pass on same router.
[15:01] <jorin91> Ive got no dual boot on my desktop. My desktop is running on ubuntu studio 12.04 tls and ik got a laptop with windows 8 wich i am on now.
[15:21] <zequence> jorin91: Well, I know much too little about the network on Ubuntu, and to be fair, whatever it is, it's most likely not specific to Ubuntu Studio, but rather either Xubuntu, or Ubunut
[15:22] <zequence> ..since Ubuntu Studio desktop stuff is derived from Xubuntu
[15:22] <zequence> And we all derive from Ubuntu
[15:22] <jorin91> alright wich channel shoud i go ?
[15:22] <smartboyhw> jorin91, either #xubuntu or #ubuntu
[15:22] <jorin91> ty for your help so far
[22:38] <davidingreenbay> hello, my 1st time here. are there really ubuntu studio Devs in here?
[22:40] <davidingreenbay> ok, i'll try this... are there ubuntu studio v10.04 LTS 64 bit users here?
[23:24] <cheezhead> Used GParted latest DVD to attempt recovering MBR on pc- ubuntu studio v10.04 LTS 64 bit. Internal SATA drive bootup says "1234F:". Is there a way to repair MBR or should i nuke the HD and reinstall?
[23:31] <cheezhead> Also, tried Spinrite v6.0, Backtrack v5r, Knoppix v4 through v7.x, Testdisk WIP (CDs/DVDs). Ubuntu Studio Alt v10.04 DVD only wants to format drive while creating new MBR. Frustrated :(
