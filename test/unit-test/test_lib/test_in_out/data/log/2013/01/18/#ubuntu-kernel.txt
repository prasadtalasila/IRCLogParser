[01:27] <datakid23> Hi, I"m having weird apt-get issues regarding a missing kernel image. It's a kernel from a while ago though - the issue happened as a result of having to move /boot (initial partition too small) coupled with updates that failed due to power failure. Pastebin of error after an apt-get upgrade: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1543233/
[01:29] <datakid23> Error message is "Internal Error: Could not find image (/boot/vmlinuz-3.2.0-31-generic)". I've tried apt-get clean/remove/update etc Anyone know where I might find that boot image online? 
[01:45] <datakid23> I am running 12.04
[02:15] <datakid23> nothing? No one can tell me where the kernel image or deb for vmlinuz-3.2.0-31-generic is? I've tried google, this was a last resort
[02:17] <lifeless> internal error from what?
[02:18] <datakid23> internal error from an apt-get upgrade/dist-upgrade
[02:19] <datakid23> apt is upgrading everything except the kernel atm, because of this unresolved config on an image that is AWOL
[02:19] <datakid23> lifeless: sorry, I should have made that clear to start with
[02:20] <lifeless> have you tried update-grub ?
[02:21] <datakid23> lifeless: yes, updating grub works fine - but apt still fails on the missing vmlinuz file
[02:21] <datakid23> the file isn't on my box at all - I'
[02:21] <datakid23> ve done a updatedb/locate
[02:21] <lifeless> well apt itself doesn't care about vmlinuz
[02:22] <lifeless> update-initramfs may
[02:22] <lifeless> and update-grub
[02:22] <lifeless> which are shell scripts used to setup your boot environment
[02:22] <lifeless> its likely one of those is the actual thing failing
[02:22] <datakid23> lifeless: it seems to be a dpkg error
[02:22] <lifeless> it may look like that
[02:23] <datakid23> as per pastebin above
[02:23] <lifeless> but dpkg, like apt, has no direct involvement with the kernel or those files.
[02:23] <datakid23> it's true - but the problem isn't with the kernel per se, it's with dpkg --configure isn't it?
[02:24] <lifeless> try dpkg -P linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic-pae
[02:27] <jwi> datakid23: you're looking for http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise-updates/linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic ?
[02:28] <datakid23> lifeless: weird. It didn't create anything new, but it has changed the errors in and apt dist-up
[02:28] <datakid23> jwi: I believe I am, thanks!
[02:29] <datakid23> lifeless: now it's complaining htat "dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of linux-image-generic:  linux-image-generic depends on linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic; however:   Package linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic is not installed."
[02:30] <datakid23> of course, apt install and apt -f install on linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic fail
[02:30] <lifeless> datakid23: does it fail the same way ?
[02:31] <datakid23> yes
[02:32] <datakid23> lifeless: for clarification, if you mean does the apt -f install fail in the same way as the dist-up fails, after having done dpkg -P... yes
[02:34] <lifeless> datakid23: did it unpack linux-image-3.2.0-31-generic to disk again ? if so the file should have been written now...
[02:35] <datakid23> lifeless: I'm still downloading the deb - I'm on the wrong side of a satellite connection (Tarawa, Kiribati)
[02:36] <datakid23> We just upgraded our network and the students are off for the summer, so there's finally enough bandwidth to look into this :|
[03:00] <datakid23> lifeless: the deb puts the ubuntu software centre into a infinite loop of fail
[03:00] <datakid23> will need to unpack/install via cli I think
[03:07] <datakid23> lifeless: ok, done, and I repeated your dpkg -P line from above, and I now have a vmlinuz-generic and initrd.img-generic but no generic-pae for this kernel 
[03:08] <datakid23> the number of errors has significantly reduced
[03:08] <datakid23> which is nice
[03:08] <datakid23> but it still fails
[03:08] <lifeless> datakid23: -pae is a separate package
[03:08] <lifeless> datakid23: you may need to repeat with that
[03:09] <datakid23> lifeless: I know I was just coming here to facepalm
[03:09] <lifeless> :)
[03:09] <datakid23> apols :)
[03:26] <datakid23> lifeless: and jwi: thanks! All sorted
[03:26] <datakid23> apt get upgrade runs without error
[03:26] <datakid23> wahoozi
[03:26] <datakid23> ok, reboot time - out

[10:18] <zequence> apw: infinity: I was testing linux-lowlatency precise-proposed. Accelerated graphics failed during first boot. Works now, after installing linux-generic (was going to see if it had the same problem). 
[10:18] <zequence> I'm not much help tracking down errors. Any tips?
[10:19] <infinity> zequence: I'm assuming that was because you didn't have headers installed and thus didn't get a dkms module build for your nvidia/fglrx drivers?
[10:20] <infinity> zequence: How were you testing?  Just by installing "linux-image-$foo"?
[10:20] <zequence> infinity: Intel graphics
[10:20] <infinity> Oh.
[10:20] <zequence> I just did a dist-upgrade to get the newer version (from proposed)
[10:20] <infinity> Define failed...
[10:21] <infinity> X went into crazy safe mode antics?
[10:21] <zequence> Seemed ok, but gnome-shell went into fallback mode
[10:21] <zequence> hmm, I accidentally went through recovery boot before I resumed normal boot though
[10:22] <infinity> When you say "Works now, after installing linux-generic", do you mean that linux-lowlatency now works after installing linux-generic, or that you're currently running generic?
[10:22] <zequence> linux-lowlatency works now, after installing -generic
[10:22] <zequence> And -generic worked also
[10:22] <infinity> Kay, then installing generic probably didn't fix/change anything.
[10:27] <zequence> infinity: I just retried booting into recovery mode first, then resume normal boot
[10:27] <zequence> That's what did it
[10:27] <zequence> no accelerated graphics

[10:30] <infinity> zequence: Okay, so totally unrelated to the kernel update.  Good to know.
[10:31] <infinity> zequence: Possibly still a bug, mind you, but not an issue with the SRU. :P
[10:32] <zequence> infinity: Yeah :). So, I'm looking at the kernel-sru-workflow at the wiki, but if I'd try a shortcut and ask you directly. I've booted the kernel for precise. Anything else I should try? And, should I change a status in the bug for the kernel?
[10:33] <infinity> zequence: Andy and I are going to have a talk with bjf about how best we should be mangling the verification tasks for those bugs.
[10:34] <infinity> zequence: For now, just dumping your comments in the tracking bug "smoketested lowlatency/i386, lowlatency-pae/i386, lowlatency/amd64 and it worked fine" (pick whatever kernel(s) you actually tested), we'll figure out proper process for next time.

[11:11] <ppisati> brb
[11:15] <apw> infinity, ok i've boot tested all 5 and put testing results in the bugs
[11:19] <infinity> apw: Shiny.
[11:27] <infinity> apw / zequence: Okay, so.  I think I've come up with something sane here without needing to talk to bjf, just from looking at how other derivatives are handled.
[11:28] <infinity> The "Verification-testing" task should have someone quickly check and see if -lowlatency fixes any bug other than the ones fixed by master.  If not, set it to Fix Released.  If yes, verify them first, then Fix Released.
[11:29] <infinity> And we should use Regression-testing to indicate that the install/reboot smoketesting has been done.
[11:29] <infinity> apw / zequence: ^-- Seem reasonable?
[11:31] <apw> infinity, seems a valid semantic to me, so mostly verification == noop as there are no patches, but if there are there is something to use
[11:32] <apw> and r-t tells us it has been tested by someone to boot, ack
[11:32] <infinity> Right.
[11:32] <infinity> Also, the bot has a hissy fit if you don't set "qa-testing-passed" as a tag when setting Regression-testing to Fix Released.
[11:33] <infinity> (I'm going to do all of this right now on the two current bugs)
[11:35] <infinity> So, in an hour or two, while I slumber, the bot should update all of this and set my SRU releasy tasks appropriately.
[11:35] <apw> sounds good
[11:35] <apw> we need to get the thing to add that tag when missing :)
[11:36] <infinity> Well, it's looking for qa-testing-passed or qa-testing-failed and assuming the QA engineer is a doofus if it finds neither.
[11:36] <infinity> Which is probably a sane safeguard for Canonical-maintained kernels.
[11:36] <infinity> Maybe overkill for others.  I dunno.
[11:39] <infinity> Oh, depending on when Shankbot's "Friday" starts, it might not update the release tasks.
[11:39] <infinity> I guess we'll see.
[11:39] <infinity> It'll get around to it by Monday, at any rate. :P
[11:40] <apw> heh

[12:08] <infinity> Oh, look at that, Shankbot doesn't think it's Friday yet.
[12:08] <infinity> apw / zequence: Releasing those kernels now.
[12:21] <infinity> rtg: Any idea what the verification status of your linux-firmware/precise SRU is?
[12:21] <infinity> rtg: (Or if you can hunt people down and find out?)

[15:04] <herton> ok cool, let me know if it something else breaks
[15:09]  * herton -> lunch
[15:25] <diwic> the directory structure under /lib/modules/<version>/ changed between quantal and raring seems to have changed, is this intentional?

[15:27] <diwic> ah wait
[15:29]  * diwic just forgot to install linux-headers.
[15:32]  * apw whines at sforshee
[15:32] <rtg> herton, so that tracking bug will puke out an upload message as soon as 3.8.0-1.5 is done building, or when it is accepted ?
[15:32] <apw> sforshee, i am seeing all sorts of badness with 3.8-rc3 raring on brcmsmac, locking up and generally going bad
[15:33] <sforshee> apw, any errors in dmesg to share?
[15:33] <sforshee> apw, this one has never worked well with brcmsmac, right?
[15:34] <apw> sforshee, a couple i have seen transmit failures and not recovered, others i have seen upsetness
[15:35] <sforshee> apw, do the errors say something about MI_TFS and then reset the hardware?
[15:35] <sforshee> I was working with broadcom on that one, but last I heard they suspected a ucode problem
[15:36] <apw> Jan 18 15:05:01 localhost kernel: [ 7538.086453] brcmsmac bcma0:0: queue 7 >= NFIFO

[15:36] <apw> but i have been using brcmsmac for the last 3-4 releases ok, and its only in 3.8 i have this poppage
[15:37] <apw> oh has tim given me new shiney microcode
[15:37] <sforshee> I don't think so
[15:37] <sforshee> it's more that something changed in the driver to expose the bug
[15:37] <rtg> apw, no changes for brcmsmac in -rc4
[15:37] <sforshee> at least that's the theory
[15:38] <apw> sigh
[15:38] <sforshee> there's corrupt data in the tx status we're being handed from the ucode
[15:38] <apw> qualtiy
[15:38] <sforshee> it's show up in various manifestatins
[15:38] <sforshee> *manifestations
[15:38] <apw> well it is cirtanly utter broke for me
[15:38] <sforshee> I'll ping broadcom about it
[15:38] <apw> thanks
[15:39]  * rtg notices that a Lenovo x120e now beeps just before S3
[15:39] <sforshee> apw if they haven't made progress I'll start a bisect, as I can reproduce one minor instance of that problem in a contrived scenario
[15:39] <apw> sforshee, ok thanks
[15:40] <sforshee> apw, what's your wireless card?
[15:54] <herton> rtg, when it enters proposed in the archive, I believe it'll be when it's accepted
[15:57] <sforshee> apw, you did try brcmsmac in 3.7 and didn't see those problems?

[17:14] <jsalisbury> arges, ack
[17:15] <jsalisbury> arges, maybe see how it was fixed in 3.3 and see if that can be backported?
[17:15] <arges> jsalisbury: yea trying to do that... git blame on yields patches that seem to alrleady be in stable
[17:16] <jsalisbury> arges, hmm
[17:18] <jsalisbury> arges, maybe the fix is already queued for 3.2 and just hasn't made it yet.
[17:19] <arges> jsalisbury: you mean in master-next ubuntu-precise
[17:20] <jsalisbury> arges, maybe here: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/stable-queue.git
[17:20] <jsalisbury> arges, did you find a specific commit that fixes the bug?  
[17:21] <arges> jsalisbury: ok i'll test that
[17:21] <arges> jsalisbury: yea i did its on the bug
[17:23] <jsalisbury> arges, commit 10e44239f67d0b6fb74006e61a7e883b8075247a had a CC to stable, so if that is the fix, it should make it into 3.2
[17:23] <arges> jsalisbury: yea that doesn't fix the issue
[17:24] <arges> jsalisbury: so that's already in 3.2.0-36
[17:24] <jsalisbury> arges, ahh, ok
[17:24] <arges> jsalisbury: anyway i'll keep poking at this
[17:24] <jsalisbury> arges, cool
[17:37] <herton> arges, jsalisbury: this is looking like a buggy backport of the patch you reverted. The commit causing the problem was a backport sent to the stable mailing list for 3.2, it differs in some parts to the mainline commit
[17:37] <arges> herton: ahh. this might be the issue then
[17:38] <arges> herton: should I try to re-backport it?
[17:39] <arges> herton: or send a mail to the stable list explaining that the stable patch is buggy
[17:40] <herton> arges, this was the thread with the set of backports: http://www.mail-archive.com/stable@vger.kernel.org/msg22850.html
[17:40] <herton> arges, better send an email I think
[17:40] <arges> herton: ok i can do that. for the time being should we revert in ubuntu?
[17:41] <herton> arges, perhaps, if we don't get a solution until next SRU time frame we could do it
