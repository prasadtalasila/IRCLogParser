[00:00] <SimplySeth> ubuntu-tester:  not until I run NetworkManager on the CLI
[00:01] <ncsquid22> rmbell: I think I know what you problem is
[00:01] <ubuntu-tester> QaDeS: ubuntu doesn't have sertificates. browser has
[00:02] <ncsquid22> traffic is probably getting to the final destination but I don't think it knows how to get back from where it came.....
[00:02] <ncsquid22> rmbell: here is the solution...
[00:02] <rmbell> heres the host info (ufw status, ifconfig, and iptables list) http://pastebin.com/MzGwVmRt
[00:02] <QaDeS> @ubuntu-tester the errors appear in my mail evolution mail client. using chrome here without any problems
[00:03] <rudi_> buenas!
[00:03] <ubuntu-tester> QaDeS: ok, evolution has its' own set of cretificates
[00:03] <QaDeS> quess it's using the certs in /etc/ssl/certs. do you know where they come from?
[00:04] <ncsquid22> rmbell: first flush your rules..."iptables -F"
[00:04] <rmbell> and vm info http://pastebin.com/adcn8VeL
[00:04] <rmbell> okay
[00:04] <ncsquid22> then check this out: http://pastebin.com/8x4JqgC6
[00:05] <ncsquid22> rmbell: please make you type your IP address correctly
[00:05] <ncsquid22> that should work
[00:05] <QaDeS> @ubuntu-tester can you help me finding which packages to update? i'm totally lost
[00:06] <rmbell> heh, flushing the iptables hosed the ssh connection, didnt it?
=== Lance is now known as Guest39999
[00:06] <ncsquid22> rmbell: It depends on your rules
[00:06] <rmbell> i had been using ufw, with only those prerouting rules added manual
[00:07] <ubuntu-tester> QaDeS: they come from package ca-certificates. i was wrong about 'ubuntu doesn't have certs'
[00:07] <ncsquid22> rmbell: if you use iptables to blacklist and whitelist stuff and you had an ssh session going...then maybe it killed it
[00:08] <ncsquid22> rmbell: let me know if it worked
[00:08] <rudi_> hi everybody, i have a problem with the boot Linux 3.2.0-24-generic, system says: drm:intel_dsm_platform_mux_info] *ERROR* MUX INFO call failed‏ ; anyone can help me please?
[00:09] <ubuntu-tester> ncsquid22: keep in mind, rmbell have ufw and on reboot/reload ufw will flush all manually added rules and place it's own
[00:09] <rmbell> which im going to do now to get back in lol
[00:09] <ncsquid22> right: rmbell try this: "sudo iptables-save"
[00:10] <rmbell> ssh session is killed, no access
[00:10] <rmbell> but like ubuntu-tester said, a reboot should flush everything and get me back in
[00:10] <tempspace> Is anybody using an Ultrabook that they are really satisfied with Ubuntu on?
[00:10] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: ask hoster to reboot :)
[00:11] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  its OVH, already in their panel rebooting :)
[00:11] <ncsquid22> rmbell: try: "sudo iptables-apply" then "sudo iptables-save"
[00:11] <ncsquid22> that should do
[00:11] <SimplySeth> I did the server install then installed the ubuntu-desktop package ... now NetworkManager will not start on login
[00:12] <ikonia> SimplySeth why not just install ubuntu desktop ?
[00:12] <ikonia> why do a server install to then install the desktop pacakge ?
[00:12] <ubuntu-tester> SimplySeth: is it desktop or server?
[00:12] <ncsquid22> if not...then you can do this: "sudo iptables-save >> myiptables.rules" then after reboot you can do "sudp iptables-restore myiptables.rules"

[00:15] <gmachine_24> ikonia, uhm, I mean I can't find it to format it.
[00:15] <ikonia> gmachine_24: what do you mean you can't find it ?
[00:15] <gmachine_24> ikonia, where would a hard drive connected via a usb interface be located? It's not under fdisk -l, etc.
[00:16] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  if i put all the iptables commands in the ufw before rule, do i just service ufw restart after?
[00:16] <ikonia> gmachine_24: if you do "sudo fdisk -l" do you see the device
[00:16] <gmachine_24> ikonia, as I just said, no.
[00:16] <ikonia> gmachine_24: no, you didn't you said "fdisk -l" I said "sudo fdisk -l"
[00:16] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: you do ufw reload
[00:16] <gmachine_24> ikonia, fine.
[00:16] <gmachine_24> sudo fdisk -l
[00:17] <ikonia> gmachine_24: is it visible in "sudo fdisk -l"

[00:25] <oo-dragon> hello,  I have been searching all day trying to get my LTSP in Edubuntu (12.04) to auto mount windows user shares.  I think I need some help.  The main sources I have been going to are the man page for pam_mount and a older active directory integration (says its for 9.04)
[00:25] <gmachine_24> ikonia, not that I can see
[00:25] <tempspace> majnoon, Are you running Ubuntu on it? If so, are you very happy with it?
[00:25] <ikonia> gmachine_24: then either the device is dead, or the usb ports are hung
[00:25] <oo-dragon> I basically just need a way to easily mount the user shares from windows Server in LTSP
[00:26] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  you mean mount a windows share via the fstab file?  or automount a home share?
[00:26] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: automount.  its for a school, integrating the LTSP with their exsiting widows Active directory domain
[00:27] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  the nautilus file manager is supposed to be able to browse and access shares also. they would get mounted to the .gvfs directory
[00:27] <jhutchins> gmachine_24: There should be activity in dmesg when you plug it in. If there isn't, there's a hardware issue (or usb driver, unlikely).
[00:27] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  'automount' can be interperted several ways.
[00:27] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  you can add fstab entrys to mount specific shares.
[00:27] <majnoon> it pretty good ,but had to modify setup (hd fried) installed ubuntu in vmware on usb drive then plug and play
[00:27] <histo> majnoon: acer revo here
[00:27] <jhutchins> oo-dragon: What do you mean by user sshares?
[00:28] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: I need them mounted at the terminals the clients will login to through LTSP
[00:28] <NinjaMyNinja> Is there a way to use something in one of the LIVE booted *buntu's to over write/wipe a hard drive ?
[00:28] <NinjaMyNinja> such as shred?
[00:28] <histo> !anybody | tempspace
[00:28] <ubottu> tempspace: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[00:28] <ubuntu-tester> oo-dragon: google offers a plenty of guides on 'samba auto mount'. did you try anything?
[00:28] <histo> NinjaMyNinja: Yes you can intall software in the live cds also
[00:28] <NinjaMyNinja> histo: what would I install? and what would the command be ?
[00:28] <jhutchins> NinjaMyNinja: THere are dedicated drive wipe images like dban.
[00:28] <oo-dragon> jhutchins: windows domain shares, where the users documents and files are
[00:29] <histo> NinjaMyNinja: the software will be removed after the next reboot.
[00:29] <oo-dragon> The problem comes in with integrating it into LTSP
[00:29] <histo> NinjaMyNinja: You could write /dev/random to the hard drive though to wipe it.
[00:29] <oo-dragon> because there are a few hundred users, it needs to be automated based on that user
[00:29] <ubuntu-tester> NinjaMyNinja: man shred
[00:29] <jhutchins> oo-dragon: You need their home shares by user, different shares at different times?
[00:29] <NinjaMyNinja> jhutchins: dban didn't want to work written directly to a flash drive
[00:30] <NinjaMyNinja> ubuntu-tester: lol
[00:30] <oo-dragon> jhutchins: just their home shares by user
[00:30] <ubuntu-tester> NinjaMyNinja: dd if=/dev/zero would be much faster though
[00:30] <oo-dragon> I have been trying pam_mount, but failed miserably (docs seem outdated).
[00:30] <jhutchins> NinjaMyNinja: It's supposed to.  There are other utility images that will do that, or you can just dd from /dev/random or /dev/zero to the drive using Debian.
[00:31] <histo> NinjaMyNinja: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda  bs=1M   would do the trick.  Assuming your hard drive is at /dev/sda
[00:31] <jonascj> So I have finally figured out that some scripts in /etc/acpi (e.g. thinkpad-stretchortouchpad.sh) gets called on certain key presses/combinations (e.g. fn+f8 which toggles the touchpad). Does anyone have any idea why these scripts get called both with and without gnome-settings-daemon but only work when gnome is running? Does this indicate that these scripts do nothing after all?
[00:31] <histo> NinjaMyNinja: or you can use /dev/random   whatever.
[00:31] <NinjaMyNinja> fdisk -l would tell me what the drive is?
[00:31] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  so the samba shares are on a windows box or linux box?
[00:32] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: Windows server 2003
[00:32] <jhutchins> NinjaMyNinja: Yes.
[00:32] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: I already have the windows authentication down, just need the shares now
[00:32] <NNK> Is there a way to query a device connected to my local network for it's configured IP using it's MAC addr?
[00:32] <gmachine_24> jhutchins, what would this usb-related output look like in dmesg? I have a bunch of lines I can paste in pastebin if someone will look at them . . .
[00:33] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  i thought  there was a special 'homes' share that if the user accessed   \\servername\home  it would get converted to  \\servername\usernameoftheuser\   but i may be thinking of how linux samba does the homes share.
[00:33] <NinjaMyNinja> so I could use dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sda  bs=1M

[00:33] <gmachine_24> jhutchins, there is a line repeated that says [ 1099.964300] hub 1-2:1.0: Cannot enable port 7.  Maybe the USB cable is bad? or similar
[00:33] <jhutchins> gmachine_24: First check to see what is there before you plug it in, then plug it in and see what chaanges
[00:33] <majnoon_> ok in here in vmware now also
[00:33] <gmachine_24> jhutchins, yeah, I've been doing that.
[00:34] <jhutchins> gmachine_24: bad hardware.
[00:34] <jhutchins> gmachine_24: Try a differenr usb port.
[00:34] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: I think that's a samba thing, windows usually just point to it, such as \\server\users\username
[00:34] <NinjaMyNinja> I'm guessing random would be better than just zeros?
[00:35] <gmachine_24> jhutchins, when I connected the drive to Windows 7 computer I got a message that said the drive needs formatting and when I tried to format it I got a message that said the drive cannot be access because of a security setting............
[00:37] <ubuntu-tester> NinjaMyNinja: better but MUCH slower. i bet you can't wait that long and hit Ctrl+C

[00:39] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: but I don't know much about that, and I think my syntex is off.  I'm trying to use gvfs-mount smb://server/share but to no avail.  using this as a guide'ish https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UnityLaunchersAndDesktopFiles
[00:39] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  and just have the file manager open that  share on login you mean?
[00:40] <Narco> what do you do when you forget your password
[00:40] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  can nautilus open that share if you type in that url?
[00:41] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: yes
[00:41] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: using gvfs-mount from the command line any way
[00:41] <ubuntu-tester> Narco: simple: remember it or reset it
[00:42] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  i mean just by typing in to the nautilus URL address bar/path bar (hit ctrl-l)
[00:42] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  if so - you could bookmark the share.
[00:42] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: how do i get that bar back in 12.04?  its just the icons you click on

[00:45] <tripelb> I need to know how to restore the boot loader since I munged it.
[00:45] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: can the nautilus use variables like $user or something? cause it will have to match the user using it

[00:48] <histo> !firewall | DrManhattan
[00:48] <ubottu> DrManhattan: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.
[00:49] <DrManhattan> I wish dd-wrt was an app that could be installed on top of ubuntu
[00:49] <DrManhattan> thank you histo

[00:51] <DrManhattan> No no no I mean a program to set up and use my linux box AS a router with ubuntu
[00:51] <DrManhattan> not just a basic firewall management program
[00:52] <DrManhattan> but thank you
[00:52] <ubuntu-tester> livefree424: what programs did you try?
[00:53] <histo> DrManhattan: well you need several things to have it act as a hardware based router. DHCP server, firewall, and conneciton management for your internet.
[00:53] <DrManhattan> histo, what do you think of http://rbgeek.wordpress.com/2012/05/14/ubuntu-as-a-firewallgateway-router/
[00:54] <histo> DrManhattan: there is also smoothwall pfsense etc...  There are tons of firewall distros and tools.
[00:55] <DrManhattan> histo, yes, I wish for something that i can use on an ubuntu box that also is used to run other things - zoneminder, service joomla, etc
[00:55] <histo> DrManhattan: looks good although I don't use webmin
[00:55] <DrManhattan> serving
[00:55] <dr_willis> oo-dragon:  thats why i mentioned a 'homes' share - samba has a special share that gets interperted as the users name.. no idea how windows does it
[00:56] <histo> DrManhattan: You may want to look into running your firewall apps in an LXC .
[00:56] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: yea windows has a GPO that points to the specific user directory, usually setup with variables for %user% kind of thing
[00:57] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: but I think you have given me enough ^_^  I figure I can create a script to get username=$(whoami) then just point the shortcut to the script
[00:57] <oo-dragon> dr_willis: thanks a bunch ^_^
[00:57] <DrManhattan> histo, if my box supported giving pci/e devices to the VM id be all over that
[00:58] <histo> DrManhattan: you don't need a VM wiht LXC's
[00:58] <histo> DrManhattan: they have direct access to your hardware
[00:58] <histo> DrManhattan: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/lxc.html
[00:58] <DrManhattan> WHat? REALLY?
[00:59] <histo> DrManhattan: You don't have to especially if it's just a home server.  I've just been reading about it lately and i'm hooked.

[01:09] <ubuntu-tester> livefree424: to have smooth 1080p playback you probably need hardware acceleration. vlc has support for it, but not as wide as windows.

[01:27] <justdave> the screen redraw happens fast, it doesn't look like it's lagging at all.

[01:30] <adrian15> Hi. Is there any special trick on Precise so that /etc/security/limits.conf seems to work for mysql user ? Trying to solve the errno 24 problems about too many files opened at the same time. Thank you.
[01:30] <dr_willis> justdave:  befor it was using unity2d i imagine.
[01:30] <dr_willis> justdave:  in 12.10 there is no Unity2d any moar
[01:30] <justdave> dr_willis: yeah, and that doesn't seem to exist anymore
[01:31] <livefree424> ok will try thanks
[01:31] <justdave> I only use it over a local network link (it's a server in a closet, and it's easier than hooking up a monitor and keyboard in the closet :)
[01:31] <justdave> and the gui config utilities are easier to use than screwing with config files
[01:31] <histo> justdave: are you using vnc over ssh?
[01:31] <justdave> histo: no, straight up VNC
[01:32] <justdave> from another box on the same local network over 1 gig link
[01:32] <dr_willis> between 2 ubuntu box's id just use ssh and x forwarding. ;)
[01:32] <justdave> and like I said, the display speed is fine, I can run something from the command line and it shows up immediately
[01:32] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  finally got a working set of iptables values but im not really sure how to translate them over to ufw, would you be able to help / know?
[01:32] <justdave> it's just the keyboard and mouse interaction that's hosed
[01:33] <Devlin> wow, they're just tearing ubuntu to pieces aren't they
[01:33] <Devlin> what happened to the old "it'll run on almost anything"
[01:33] <histo> justdave: it's probably the video
[01:33] <rmbell> if anyone knows how to convert some iptables rules to ufw before.rules, can you take a look at these http://pastebin.com/M6aAnC7C
[01:34] <Devlin> well i'm off again
[01:34] <dr_willis> Devlin:  they decided its not worth the manpower to run on dinosaurs
[01:34] <kmiller> Blender Still wont run :(
[01:34] <justdave> histo:
[01:34] <justdave> 20:32:34 < justdave> and like I said, the display speed is fine, I can run something from the command line and it shows up  immediately
[01:34] <histo> justdave: running something vs. a moving object are two completely different things.
[01:34] <justdave> (if I ssh in and set DISPLAY)
[01:34] <dr_willis> and with the changes in 12.10 it is supposed to be abnle to run unity on lower end gfx cards.. but thats a work in progress
[01:34] <justdave> histo: I'm not trying to move anything, I'm trying to click on buttons and type.
[01:34] <histo> justdave: for instance install cmatrix and run that in a terminal watch how horrible the frame rate is.
[01:35] <histo> justdave: you are moving a mouse pointer and interacting with icons that have visual effects.  I don't think you understand unity.
[01:36] <histo> justdave: check out tightvnc imo is much faster. If that isn't good enough look into freenx
[01:36] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: read man ufw-framework, see /etc/ufw/before.rules, syntax is same as iptables
[01:36] <justdave> histo: ok, I tried just that (cmatrix) and it runs full-speed, no lag. :)
[01:36] <dr_willis> if you can see the other pc's monitor  - synergy will let you controll it. ;)
[01:37] <justdave> (via "DISPLAY=:0 gnome-terminal -e cmatrix" from an ssh shell)
[01:37] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  i tried but couldnt get the syntax right, would result in ufw-init errors :(
[01:37] <histo> justdave: so unity is the issue since there is no 2d anymore.
[01:37] <chalcedony> my husband can't get sound to work in his new computer, with ubuntu 12.04 - where to start?
[01:37] <histo> justdave: run gnome 2 or a different DE
[01:37] <histo> !sound > chalcedony
[01:37] <ubottu> chalcedony, please see my private message
[01:38] <Byan> can anyone help me setup windows in grub?
[01:38] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: syntax is same as iptables, just omit 'iptables'
[01:38] <Byan> it wasn't automatically setup when I installed..
[01:38] <justdave> histo: how do I change that?
[01:38] <dr_willis> Byan:  try reruning update-grub to see if it finds it?
[01:38] <histo> !grub2 > Byan
[01:38] <ubottu> Byan, please see my private message
[01:38] <Byan> dr_willis: does not find it
[01:38] <justdave> preferably from the command line since using the GUI to change it will be hopeless :)
[01:39] <histo> justdave: Just install another desktop environment and choose it from the login screen.
[01:39] <justdave> histo: using the gui will be hopeless
[01:39] <Byan> histo: already looked there
[01:40] <Byan> I wonder if I screwed something up with the windows install by mucking with it's paritions hrm
[01:40] <histo> justdave: okay well you could use xfce   sudo apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies
[01:40] <kslater> is there an easy way to get grub to show me the boot menu? Short of rebooting of course.
[01:40] <justdave> histo: I have it installed, how do I tell lightdm to use it?
[01:40] <livefree424> ubuntu-tester: i enabled that and it made no difference when i go to play a file it starts for a brief second and then stops video but audio keeps playing
[01:40] <histo> justdave: click the little ubuntu logo next to your login name
[01:41] <justdave> histo: I have no gui and it's set to auto-login at boot
[01:41] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  syntax isnt the same or im not putting it into the right section or something. simply removing iptables from the commands prevents ufw from reloading/starting
[01:41] <justdave> and since I have no GUI I can't tell it to log out :)
[01:41] <histo> justdave: sudo nano /etc/lightdb/lightdm.conf  change the user-session=ubuntu  line to the session you want.
[01:42] <histo> justdave: you can get a list of session from /usr/share/xsessions
[01:42] <ubuntu-tester> livefree424: maybe your hardware is not supported. ask on vlc channel
[01:42] <livefree424> i just tried it in openshot video editor and it played just fine
[01:42] <livefree424> so at least i can edit
[01:43] <histo> justdave: sorry type there.  Do ls /usr/share/xsessions/   to see what sessions are availible.  Then sudo nano /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and change the user line
[01:43] <alami> i ahve a problem with matlab and i google and the question is i need to make a link to a libstc but i don't know how
[01:43] <histo> justdave: reboot and vnc into your xfce desktop
[01:43] <wolftune> so I'm using the latest AMD catalyst proprietary drivers and it seems to be working, but something is bugging me
[01:43] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: do your commands above work when added with iptables?
[01:44] <histo> justdave: also if this is a server you really need to learn command line. Much easier than dealing with X and these issues.
[01:44] <justdave> histo: I know command line, quite well.
[01:44] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  yes, i think it has to do with how it calls filters, looking a bit deeper
[01:44] <rmbell> since mine started with -t nat
[01:44] <justdave> but it's a media server, and the config for the tuner config and whatnot is all gui
[01:44] <wolftune> When I installed the AMD drivers in the past, glxgears (I know it's not a benchmark) was relatively high fps. Now it is tied to refresh rate around 60fps.
[01:44] <wolftune> is this an indication that I didn't install right or something isn't set right?
[01:44] <histo> justdave: Why do you even have a desktop on a headless server then?
[01:45] <justdave> histo: so I can get into the config utilities for the media server
[01:45] <dr_willis> justdave:  for a headless server  you definatly dont want to be using x11vnc server.
[01:45] <histo> justdave: what media server are you using?
[01:45] <justdave> (other boxes in the house hooked up to TVs stream from it)
[01:45] <justdave> histo: mythtv
[01:45] <histo> dr_willis
[01:45] <carrett> hi. i want to be able to run ubuntu off my usb drive while having a separate partition for just storing files like normal. is there a page that'll guide me through setting that up? i'm currently on debian...thanks.
[01:46] <histo> justdave: yeah you can control mythtv from the command line and edit it's configs.
[01:46] <justdave> used to use vnc4server with a non-console X server created by vnc4server
[01:46] <dwarder> hello
[01:46] <justdave> but that quit working when I upgraded to 12.10
[01:47] <histo> justdave: also if the only thing you are using in the gui is mythtv  you may want to just startx on the box and run the myththv app. A lot let resource hungry than lightdm+unity+mythtv
[01:47] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: i think you should modify chains you add rules to. ufw made its own chains, see comments in the beginning
[01:47] <justdave> you *can* edit config files, but the gui is still easier to use.
[01:47] <justdave> which isn't always the case - there's a lot of stuff I'd rather edit config files for

[01:48] <dwarder> i have my windows 7 installed and using all hdd, i've inserted ubuntu 12.10 dvd 64 bit, and it said that i have ubuntu 12.04 installed and asked me if i want to update it or install the new version alongside, what the?!
[01:48] <justdave> since half of mythtv's config is in files and half is in the database it's easier to let the config utilities figure it out :)
[01:48] <dwarder> did windows was copied from ubuntu 12.04? ;)
[01:48] <justdave> (than having to open an mysql command line and figure out SQL to change things for some of them)
[01:48] <carrett> ubuntu-tester: nope. but thanks.
[01:48] <histo> justdave: can't you control the config from the clients anyhoot?
[01:49] <justdave> histo: some of it, not all of it.
[01:49] <ubuntu-tester> !sound | chalcedony

[01:49] <histo> justdave: can I pm you?
[01:50] <justdave> sure

[02:36] <MikeRL> Hello guys. It appears either Xorg, the open source AMD graphics driver, or the kernel is taking a dump and hard freezing. I am on Ubuntu 13.04 64 bit development branch with the latest updates. I also had hard freezes on Quantal. What logs should I gather since there is no error report popping up when the crash occurs. I cannot CTRL ALT F whatever to open up a virtual terminal session.
[02:37] <usr13> MikeRL: 13.04?
[02:37] <histo> MikeRL: #ubuntu+1 please
[02:37] <MikeRL> OK. I will change channels.
[02:37] <histo> MikeRL: for quantal you can stay but not 13.04
[02:38] <oo-dragon> Does any one know how to check to make sure a windows share (example smb://server/'share') exists before trying to connect to it?
[02:38] <MikeRL> Well, if it happens on Quantal, where should I gather the logs from? Are there more logs than those in /var/log that I should gather?
[02:38] <histo> MikeRL: you should gather the /var/log/syslog dmesg and /var/log/Xorg.0.log   for bug report
[02:38] <oo-dragon> and if it does not, create it?
[02:38] <MikeRL> Thanks. I will go over to the development channel and see if the same applies to Raring.

[02:39] <MikeRL> Yep. Annoying. My guess is you also have an AMD Radeon HD graphics card?
[02:39] <AntiSol> oo-dragon: um... you could maybe use smbclient to do the test but creating the share will be difficult at best

[02:40] <Nasuga> MikeRL: OR atleast the newest one AMD's site offered.
[02:40] <histo> AntiSol: smbtree will display all the shares visable tot he machine.
[02:40] <MikeRL> With the closed source drivers? Neither computer I have will even load those (AMD's problem) The open source drivers are crapping out on me which is strange to me, since this has never happened before, believe it or not.
[02:41] <Nasuga> MikeRL, I had to run the script in root with -buildpkg and have to keep forcing dpkg to install the debs it produced.
[02:41]  * histo happy with nvidia
[02:41] <smw> Anyone know how to configure empathy in ubuntu 12.10?
[02:42] <smw> pretty much my complaints perfectly match http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2079243
[02:42] <Nasuga> histo: Nvidia doesn't work for me either :(, I have blue youtube with black pixels transparent.
=== tanitum is now known as almarshall
[02:42] <smw> All the settings are gone for no apparent reason
[02:42] <histo> Nasuga: not here.  install flash
[02:43] <Nasuga> histo: My flash is the newest. It's still blue and black pixels are still transparent. I had the problem on Windows and Linux on different comps.
[02:43] <AntiSol> histo: I wasn't aware of smbtree, good tip! :)
[02:43] <kunji> Nasuga: google around a bit, I think that is fairly common with Nvidia chips and there are workarounds, I've had the problem before, don't remember exactly what I did to fix it though.
[02:43] <histo> Nasuga: I would blame flash not nvidia on that one.
[02:44] <Nasuga> kunji: I figured out how to fix the blue screen for the majority of the time but if I go blue screen it starts to strobe and change colours.
[02:44] <kunji> histo: It's a combination I think, but the workaround is on the Nvidia side
[02:45] <kunji> Nasuga: https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1079711
[02:46] <dr_willis> Im reminded now of why i always use these Youtube-downloader apps. ;)
[02:46] <kunji> Nasuga: It's libvdpau  someone has a ppa with a fixed one though
[02:47] <kunji> dr_willis: Those are great, though you need to remember to update it with it's own update thing after getting it from the software center, otherwise it doesn't work.
[02:47] <Nasuga> Kunji: I already read the thread before and it only fixed the blue without full screen. Full screen would kill anyone who's sensitive to stobe lights.
[02:48] <kunji> Nasuga: Hmm, interesting, might be unrelated then, that had fixed mine for fullscreen.
[02:50] <mojtaba> Hi
[02:51] <mojtaba> Does anybody know how can I configure openvpn server and configure my windows clients?
[02:51] <mojtaba> I am pretty new to ubuntu and linux era.
[02:51] <dr_willis> !openvpn
[02:51] <ubottu> OpenVPN is a vpn technology in Ubuntu, sudo apt-get install openvpn and then see http://openvpn.net/ and see the documentation "HOWTO" noting you have already installed it. ;-) It rocks!
[02:51] <mojtaba> Any simplified help is highly appreciated.
[02:52] <kunji> mojtaba: openvpn is ambitious for a newbie ^_^, for something as particular as that you're much more likely to find good help in #openvpn
[02:52] <mojtaba> kunji: Thank you very much
[02:52] <mojtaba> ubottu: Thank you very much
[02:52] <ubottu> mojtaba: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[02:52] <mojtaba> :)
[02:53] <smw> anyone know if it is possible to install the 12.04 version of empathy
[02:53] <kunji> mojtaba: It's dr_willis that needs the thanks for calling up ubottu: see the "!openvpn"
[02:53] <xangua> smw: sudo apt-get install empathy ; it already comes installed by default
[02:54] <smw> xangua, I am on 12.10, but I want the old empathy
[02:54] <smw> xangua, the new one is a major regression for a ton of reasons
[02:54] <mojtaba> thanks all
[02:55] <kunji> smw: It's certainly possible, I forget the commands though.  Do a little googling, and if you can't find it, then I'll do some googling :P
[02:55] <cincinnatus> Were some Compiz plugins (e.g. cube deformation) removed from Quantal?
[02:55] <dr_willis> cincinnatus:  a lot ae disabled by default. or not installed by default
[02:55] <dr_willis> some compiz plugins can break unity
[02:56] <cincinnatus> dr_willis: I know some of them are experimental / unstable as well
[02:56] <cincinnatus> dr_willis: (which I don't mind)
[02:56] <aperture_> My friend installed ubuntu 12.04(?). It didn't have dash. He did an update with 1000 changes and now X11 isn't working and it says it can't mount /
[02:56] <smw> kunji, any idea what happened to it?
[02:56] <aperture_> I can drop into root console, anything I can do to help it?
[02:56] <smw> kunji, they completely destroyed empathy
[02:56] <kunji> smw: Or it's probably in the manual for apt-get, see if there's info for installing a particular version of a package in there (run man apt-get)
[02:56] <kunji> smw: No idea, I don't use empathy
[02:56] <cincinnatus> dr_willis: but I see more plugins in Precise than in Quantal after installing all of those compiz-plugins-* packages
=== aperture_ is now known as appy
[02:58] <smw> kunji, nm, I just uninstalled empathy and installed pidgin :-\
[02:59] <kunji> smw: Well, if that works for you, I always use pidgin myself anyway.
[03:00] <smw> kunji, I feel like every upgrade is a regression :-\
[03:00] <kunji> smw: Hmm, hit and miss here.
[03:02] <machicola> which command line tool could be used to find the IPs of computers on the local network
[03:03] <dr_willis> machicola:  you could scan the network with nmap - but thats a little over kill at times
[03:04] <dr_willis> a ping scan should work  in most cases
[03:05] <machicola> nice, which IPs would I be scanning? don't I need to give an IP range
[03:05] <machicola> ok, so IPs are not freely given I take it
[03:05] <machicola> would have to scan a particular range that is typical of the local network range
[03:06] <dr_willis> machicola:  yes.. you would be giveing it a range to scan
[03:06] <machicola> ok
[03:07] <dr_willis> unless you want to scan the whole internet. ;P
[03:07] <dr_willis> unless you want to scan the whole internet. ;P
[03:08] <dormito> I ran the rsync command as specified in  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Partitioning/Home/Moving however  when I ran a diff I still got "File /home/dullfire/.dropbox/command_socket is a socket while file /data/home/dullfire/.dropbox/command_socket is a socket" (and one other for iface_socket  ) Im not entirely certain what that means but dropbox still doesnt thinks its not accossiated with my account
[03:09] <dr_willis> May be a good idea to just rename the dropbox stuff and let dropbox remake them?
[03:10] <dr_willis> or just skip that one file. since it most likelyis special and used while dropbox is running
[03:11] <dr_willis> i need to learn more rsync. ;)

[03:23] <JakeR5555> problem solued
[03:23] <thiefy> help!   help!   (on a different computer) i just tried to install the drivers for a dell inspiron 1720 - it's wifi drivers.     the wired lan worked just fine... but now it doesn't even work.  it is a bcm4321 wifi card.  in synaptic, i installed the STA drivers as recommended.  now i have no wired or wireless working.
[03:24] <unix> JakeR5555 realy? :)) send him to me :)
[03:25] <JakeR5555> he is with us all the time
[03:26] <JakeR5555> i never had a problem with lan but i think the wifi is not provided by ubuntu
[03:26] <JakeR5555> so you are on your own with wifi
[03:26] <thiefy> ok, well, now i have no lan or wlan.

[03:26] <thiefy> how can i get the lan back at least?
[03:27] <dr_willis> weird thatinstall ing sta would break the wired network
[03:27] <usr13> thiefy: iwconfig  ?
[03:27] <thiefy> yep. i'm there usr13      it says this:                                   Systems installed from CDROM can add the install CD as a package source and install bcmwl-kernel-source using apt-get as above. However, if you want to do it manually then the instructions are as follows:
[03:27] <thiefy> Navigate the install media and install the packages listed below by double clicking OR install the packages consecutively from a Terminal (in the commands below the install media is mounted at /cdrom, but yours maybe different):
[03:28] <usr13> thiefy: If it is an update the broke it, just revert to previous kernel.
[03:28] <dr_willis> thiefy:  what release of ubuntu is this? and where did these drivers come from?
[03:28] <JakeR5555> can i tell ulimit to limit RAM for a specific program ?
[03:28] <cztkin3z> ubuntu软件中心，install 附加工具，
[03:28] <thiefy> it's mint, based off of 12.10 ubuntu.   the drivers came from synaptic
[03:29] <cztkin3z> O:-)
[03:29] <thiefy> an update didn't break it.  the computer freshly installed had no wifi listed when i did a  ifconfig
[03:29] <dr_willis> thiefy:  i would have to suggest going to  the mint channels then. Could be some odd quirk in how they have done the kernels or drivers

[03:29] <lucenut_> Hi guys. I installed xubuntu on an HP Mini. No wireless.
[03:29] <thiefy> it has NOTHING to do with mint.
[03:29] <lucenut_> I plugged into the network, ran all the updates.
[03:29] <thiefy> it has EVERYTHING to do with debian/ubuntu
[03:29] <dr_willis> you cant prove it has nothing to do with mint changes.. and i have seen mint have very weird issues that are not in a normal ubuntu install.
[03:29] <lucenut_> then I went into "Additional Drivers" and there was a Broadcom Alternative driver. I checked that and restarted and unplugged the cable and still no wireless showed up.
[03:30] <thiefy> me too lucenut, then i installed the drivers, now not even my wired internet works.
[03:30] <usr13> lucenut_: lspci |grep ireless | pastebinit   #And show us resulting URL
[03:30] <JakeR5555> thiefy is strange that you went to mint because it include the wifi drivers but it broke your lan and wifi
[03:30] <JakeR5555> irony
[03:30] <cgkades> lucenut_: i'm on an hp mini right now
[03:30] <thiefy> i "went" to mint?
[03:30] <thiefy> i just hate unity.
[03:30] <JakeR5555> yes you said it's mint
[03:30] <smmsadrnezh> transmission-gtk does'nt work after installation of transmission-daemon. but web interface of transmission works correctly. Why?
[03:30] <usr13> thiefy: I find that hard to believe. See ifconfig
[03:30] <JakeR5555> ubuntu is different distro
[03:30] <dr_willis> theres alternative desktops if you dont want unity.
[03:30] <cgkades> lucenut_: i set up wireless a while ago, dont remember howm, but i know i used google to figure it out. the answer is out there
[03:31] <thiefy> i did a bloody ifconfig  it shows no wlan and no eth...
[03:31] <usr13> thiefy: ifconfig -a
[03:31] <JakeR5555> mint channel is dead.. nobdy talks there
[03:31] <dr_willis> thiefy:  then i would suggest using a live cd. see if wired works and see what module its using. and then figure out why that module is not loading or broken on your install
[03:31] <JakeR5555> scary to use mint if nobody will help you with it
[03:31] <dr_willis> the main mint channel is on a differnt irc server.
[03:31] <thiefy> ifconfig -a     ---- all it shows is the lo (the loopback)
[03:32] <dr_willis> No idea how active it is.
[03:32] <JakeR5555> dr_willis where ?
[03:32] <thiefy> jake, that is why i am asking in here. useless in the mint channel.

[03:32] <thiefy> i wasn't even going to say i am using mint, cause then the helpers just blame the fact that it's not vanilla ubuntu here.
[03:33] <dr_willis> thiefy:  and i have seen where mint does break things.  and Mint is supposed to include a lot of drivers that ubuntu dosent.
[03:33] <madprops> i wonder why they don't have the mint channel on freenode
[03:33] <usr13> thiefy: Well, that is a valid complaint
[03:33] <dr_willis> most of the arguments would point to  the conclusion  to 'not use mint'
[03:33] <madprops> mint's not bad
[03:33] <dr_willis> but the basic trouble shooting would still apply. determine the module. see why its not loading
[03:33] <lucenut_> usr13 I don't exactly know what that all was. I typed it into a terminal up to pastebinit and it says "You are trying to send an empty document" and it said
[03:34] <thiefy> ok, pretend i'm not using mint (or i can come back in a few days and tell people here i'm using straight ubuntu, and then ask again)    what can i do to get back to the way the OS comes for lan and wlan drivers?
[03:34] <dr_willis> but the basic trouble shooting would still apply. determine the module. see why its not loading  <<<<<<<<, thiefy
[03:34] <usr13> thiefy: You don't go to #suse for help with Ubuntu?  Right?
[03:34] <thiefy> mint bloody is ubuntu. geez. get over it.
[03:34] <smmsadrnezh> plz help me. transmission-gtk doesn't work (it doesn't find any peer to connect and everything stay in idle status) after installation of transmission-daemon but web interface of transmission works correctly. Why?

[03:35] <dr_willis> thiefy:  or they can say no..
[03:35] <thiefy> ok dr will. you be that way.  can someone else provide help?
[03:35] <dr_willis> they dont know what kind of rubber nike isusing.

[03:36] <thiefy> holy shit.  can anyone help or not?
[03:36] <dr_willis> thiefy:  ive given you the basic thread for trouble shooting... determine the module.. try to load it/determine why its not loading
[03:36] <cgkades> thiefy: have you checked dmesg for errors or any other logs?
[03:36] <thiefy> no cgkades. how would i do that?
[03:37] <cgkades> thiefy: type dmesg in a terminal.. or better yet dmesg | less
[03:37] <dr_willis> 'dmesg' is a command you run. that provides information aboyt the system
[03:37] <thiefy> ok, what am i lookin fer in the dmesg?
[03:37] <lucenut_> When I greg ireless and it says empty document does that mean I have no wireless driver?
[03:38] <dr_willis> lucenut_:  what command are you using exactly?
[03:38] <usr13> thiefy: YOu can more-than-likely get your device working but your IRC support needs to come from  #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[03:38] <cgkades> thiefy: something regarding the chipset of your network card, or about eth0 or eth1
[03:38] <vladimirsanchez> ??b43w
[03:38] <cgkades> thiefy: anything about errors and stuff :)
[03:38] <lucenut_> That's pretty cool that it sends my info to pastebin.
[03:39] <lucenut_> What else can I do?
[03:39] <cgkades> thiefy: also try lspci
[03:40] <lucenut_> It has a broadcom driver listed and I checked that.
[03:40] <cgkades> lucenut_: i forget how i enabled wireless on my hp mini, but i'm pretty sure it involved "HP mini wireless ubuntu" in a google search

[03:48] <lucenut_> Hey guys. This is all WAY over my head.
[03:49] <lucenut_> I used to have Ubuntu 11 on this thing and wifi worked.
[03:49] <usr13> dr_willis: ... makes things much simplier ...
[03:49] <lucenut_> But it was so slow barely useable.
[03:49] <dr_willis> usr13: added bonus - the usb dongle thats well supported in linux.. worked on my Linux Based Set-top-media player automatically. ;)
[03:49] <lucenut_> So my buddy said xubuntu would be better.
[03:49] <usr13> dr_willis: Yep.  I like stuff that just works.
[03:49] <lucenut_> I see my chipset here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[03:49] <dr_willis> lucenut_:  they all use the same core drivers.. Now changing to a newer version  may help
[03:49] <lucenut_> But the steps are incomprehensible to me.
[03:50] <dr_willis> lucenut_:  you do have a wired connection to use for a little while?
[03:50] <lucenut_> On that other page it said just to check that additional driver which I did.
[03:50] <lucenut_> Yes, it's plugged in now.
[03:50] <cgkades> lucenut_: what version of ubuntu are you on? i can see what i have installed i think
[03:51] <usr13> lucenut_: If you hook up to a wired connection to the interent and follow the instructions, it should work as expected.
[03:51] <lucenut_> I am chatting on another machine though.
[03:51] <lucenut_> Sadly I cannot figure out how to IRC on the ubuntu machine.
[03:51] <dr_willis>  That additional driver tool should let you download/install the needed packages..
[03:51] <dr_willis> lucenut_:  install xchat ;)
[03:51] <lucenut_> It is xubuntu 12.10
[03:52] <usr13> lucenut_: There is a section for 12.10
[03:52] <lucenut_> I have pidgin running and I added my irc name. It said I was "identified".
[03:52] <lucenut_> But then I don't know what to do to find #ubuntu
[03:52] <usr13> lucenut_: I use irssi  (for IRC).
[03:52] <cgkades> lucenut_: install weechat-curses
[03:52] <syntroPi> Any recommendations for syncml with Android?
[03:52] <cgkades> and use the terminal

[03:53] <usr13> syntroPi: Plug in a USB cord
[03:53] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> So back to W: Failed to fetch http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/Release  Unable to find expected entry 'partner/binary-amd64/Packages' in Release file (Wrong sources.list entry or malformed file)                              How Can I Fix this?
[03:53] <lucenut_> OK, on that askubuntu page it sirst says for 12.10 to check the additional driver which I did.
[03:54] <lucenut_> Will I have to unplug the cable to see if wireless is working?
[03:54] <lucenut_> I restarted without the cable in and still no wifi thing showed.
[03:55] <lucenut_> Then it says if that doesn't work to do synaptic?
[03:55] <lucenut_> I installed synaptic but have no idea how to use it.
[03:55] <cgkades> lucenut_: ifconfig -a gives you nothing?
[03:55] <usr13> lucenut_: synaptic is just a GUI front end for apt
=== tensorpuddin is now known as tensorpudding
[03:56] <dr_willis> You can have wireless and wired both connected
[03:56] <warz> hi all, is there still an internate-based installer iso? one that the installer grabs packages from the internet?
[03:56] <mysteriousdarren> ya well i used pidgin for a while, but xchat is where its at
[03:56] <lucenut_> I typed ifconfig -a and got a whole page full of stuff.
[03:57] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  you may want to disable the  Prtners repository either via the package-manager tools/gui or by editing the sources.list file
[03:57] <cgkades> lucenut_: try ifconfig eth0 and ifconfig eth1
[03:57] <usr13> syntroPi: There is also "FileExpert" if you have a wireless AP.
[03:57] <dr_willis> !netinstall | warz
[03:57] <ubottu> warz: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall - Don't want to use a CD? See http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
[03:57] <lucenut_> Nothing about wireless though.
[03:57] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> where is the sources.listfile
[03:57] <somsip> warz: You maybe want the minimal install. Yes, it still exists
[03:57] <cgkades> lucenut_: my wireless is eth1
[03:57] <syntroPi> usr13 well that's just plain connection but which software would I use?
[03:58] <usr13> syntroPi: Software?  Software for what?
[03:58] <usr13> syntroPi: (What do you want to do?
[03:58] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> dr_willis where is the sources.list file
[03:58] <lucenut_> cgkades both show stuff about ethernet.
[03:58] <lucenut_> Can I send those to pastebin?
[03:58] <syntroPi> usr13 for syncing calendars events contacts and so on
[03:59] <usr13> syntroPi: You use gmail?
[03:59] <lucenut_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1554071
[03:59] <cgkades> lucenut_: sure. your mini only has 2 networking devices
[03:59] <cgkades> lucenut_: so one of those (like mine) is the wireless
[03:59] <usr13> syntroPi: (Android is Google.)
[03:59] <syntroPi> yes but dont want google servers
[04:00] <jdii> anyone here familiar with systemtap on ubuntu?
[04:00] <usr13> syntroPi: You don't want google?    Well, I dono then.
[04:00] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> hmm
[04:00] <usr13> syntroPi: (You have a google phone, so....)
[04:01] <lucenut_> That pastebin tell you anything kades?
[04:01] <DaemonicApathy> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:01] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> ok
[04:01] <cgkades> can you pastbin ifconfig -a
[04:01] <DaemonicApathy> cd / && sudo find -name <file>
[04:02] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> delete all the deb files?
[04:02] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu  oneiric main restricted universe
[04:02] <lucenut_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1554076
[04:03] <zachcando> Ubuntu sucks ass
[04:03] <syntroPi> usr13 yes but i dont want my contacts on their server tjerefore i want to sync locally with syncml. which software ist compatible witj syncevolution on the android side?
[04:03] <Tex_Nick> !language | zachcando
[04:03] <ubottu> zachcando: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[04:03] <DaemonicApathy> zachcando: Welcome to a pointless exercise.
[04:04] <cgkades> lucenut_: so you have a cable plugged in right? looks like eth1 should be your wireless
[04:04] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> what should be inside /etc/apt/sources.list DaemonicApathy
[04:04] <lucenut_> Yes
[04:04] <lucenut_> OK, what do I di then?
[04:04] <usr13> syntroPi: I don't know.  I just use it as it is.  The calendar is there, the email is there, I can use them both on my PC or my phone, there is nothing to to configure, nothing to do.  I can transfer files back and forth.  What else do I need?
[04:04] <lucenut_> do
[04:05] <usr13> syntroPi: Not sure what you want to do but I've been using an android phone for several years, I'm here for you if you have any questions, (as well as [probably] many others).
[04:06] <cgkades> lucenut_: you're in xubuntu?
[04:06] <lucenut_> Crap, I see synaptic is installed, but I don't know how to open it.
[04:06] <DaemonicApathy> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: I wasn't paying attention to your problem, and I probably won't be much help. I just saw you ask where something is.
[04:06] <lucenut_> Yes, Xubuntu 12.10
[04:06] <redengin_> anyone running fglrx drivers?
[04:07] <zachcando> anyone running 12.10 32bit and having problems with flash video?
[04:07] <usr13> lucenut_: Alt-F2 synaptic
[04:07] <cgkades> lucenut_: i'm on ubuntu so i dont know what to do from here. but your card is working properly
[04:07] <lucenut_> OK, I have it running now. Is it going to help me?
[04:07] <cgkades> lucenut_: you just need to figure out how to configure it in xubuntu
[04:07] <lucenut_> Really?
[04:08] <lucenut_> Where would you start?
[04:08] <lucenut_> configuring it?
[04:09] <usr13> cgkades: Configure what?
[04:09] <Tex_Nick> !details | redengin & zachcando
[04:09] <ubottu> redengin & zachcando: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[04:09] <lucenut_> He said my wireless card is working properly based on that pastebin.
[04:09] <cgkades> usr13: configure his working wireless card
[04:09] <lucenut_> But I have to "configure it"?
[04:10] <lucenut_> I'm on Xubuntu 12.10
[04:10] <cgkades> at this point my knowledge of debain based systems is fialing me
[04:10] <usr13> cgkades: O
[04:10] <cgkades> i know how to configure it in red hat :)
[04:10] <backupsguy> hi #ubuntu!
[04:10] <DaemonicApathy> Hi, backupsguy.
[04:10] <lucenut_> Ideas usr13?
[04:10] <zachcando> I try to play flash video in a web browser and it refuses to work. I've tried Chrome, Firefox, Chromium. All the same deal.
[04:10] <usr13> cgkades: Well, the process is more-than-likely similar
[04:10] <backupsguy> i know that http://serverfault.com/questions/102697/unix-user-alias isn't the best practice. but what's the alternative?
[04:11] <backupsguy> hi DaemonicApathy
[04:11] <cgkades> usr13: there is no /etc/sysconfig
[04:11] <usr13> backupsguy: ifconfig
[04:12] <backupsguy> usr13: ?
[04:12] <usr13> backupsguy: Or edit /etc/network/interfaces
[04:12] <dr_willis>  /etc/sysctl.conf  perhaps?
[04:12] <backupsguy> usr13: are you talking to someone else?
[04:12] <Tex_Nick> !flash | zachcando
[04:12] <ubottu> zachcando: To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - See also  !Restricted and !Gnash
[04:12] <usr13> cgkades: Yes, you are correct.
[04:12] <lucenut_> So cgkades does that mean I shouldn't be worrying about drivers in synaptic?
[04:12] <dr_willis> lucenut_:  synaptic and addational-drivers install the same stuff
[04:13] <lucenut_> OK
[04:13] <usr13> cgkades: /etc/network/interfaces
[04:13] <lucenut_> So if my wireless card is "working", what does it take to "configure" it?
[04:13] <cgkades> lucenut_: it looks just like my system. i just dont know how to have xubuntu edit your network stuff. in ubuntu i have an icon that i can click on to enable or disable wireless etc
[04:14] <zachcando> installed Gnash and flashinstall whatever from repo. Nothing works. Installed ubuntu-restricted-extras. No deal.
[04:14] <syntroPi> usr13, well i know i can exchange files via bluetooth, usb, wlan and even mobile network. But what i want to establish a local connection (usb, bluetooth or wlan) with evolution on ubuntu and there is syncevolution which uses syncml protocol to do that. Im just not sure which counterpart on the android phone is compatible with it (Synthesis SyncML is very expensive but may work, also there is FunV10 (former fundambol) and 4myPAL SyncML Clien
[04:14] <syntroPi> t ). My question would be if there are any experiences with those
[04:14] <cgkades> lucenut_: i would look in system settings some where.. i'm just not famialar with the XFCE enought to navagate blind
[04:14] <Tex_Nick> zachcando : if that doesn't help report back ... someone can probably help with specifics
[04:14] <lucenut_> In xubuntu settings there's a Network Connections. But nothing is under wireless.
[04:14] <backupsguy> so anyone?
[04:14] <backupsguy> i know that http://serverfault.com/questions/102697/unix-user-alias isn't the best practice. but what's the alternative?
[04:14] <usr13> cgkades: See man interfaces, (or http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man5/interfaces.5.html )
[04:14] <cgkades> lucenut_: and my only real laptop is getting warenty repaire, so i cant even boot a vm
[04:15] <lucenut_> Should I "Add" a wireless connection?
[04:15] <usr13> syntroPi: I don't use a PC based email client, I use gmail, (much simplier).
[04:15] <dr_willis> lucenut_:  sure why not. ;)
[04:16] <cgkades> lucenut_: yeah, what dr_willis said
[04:16] <usr13> syntroPi: I suggest you use gmail.
[04:16] <dr_willis> lucenut_:  i have a dozen wireless networks seen under my little Wirelress icon at the top right
[04:16] <zachcando> From my googling I came up with my proc doesn't support SSE2 in flash 11 but I installed a flash 10 version and still no dice.
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest61918
[04:16] <syntroPi> usr13 i do use gmail but that wouldnt include contacts events and calendars
[04:17] <lucenut_> OK, adding the wireless connection worked!
[04:17] <usr13> syntroPi: On the contrary, it would
[04:17] <usr13> syntroPi: ... it does ...
[04:17] <dr_willis> I still wonder what all these 2wire#### things are here in the usa
[04:17] <lucenut_> Thanks a million.
[04:18] <cgkades> lucenut_: awesome
[04:18] <syntroPi> usr13 i know they provide contact sync over google server, but i dont want to ask anyone on my phonebook if they are ok with exporting their data to us google servers
[04:19] <Tex_Nick> zachcando : http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/ ... what version of flash does that page show you are using
[04:19] <usr13> syntroPi: "phonebook"?
[04:19] <syntroPi> usr13 its just my preference to sync locally period. I know its possible but i never have done it with syncevolution
[04:20] <usr13> syntroPi: "contact sync over google server"?
[04:20] <usr13> syntroPi: I have no idea what you are talking about.
[04:20] <syntroPi> usr13 s/contact/contacts/g
[04:21] <usr13> ?
[04:21] <usr13> syntroPi: Can you elaborate?
[04:21] <zachcando> I'm on 10 but 10 and 11 give the same results
[04:22] <syntroPi> usr13 i am talking about my contacts in my phonebook of my android device, not my email contacts in gmail. those i only want to sync over a local connection with evolution. Same goes for events in androids calendar and notes in my android device
[04:23] <Tex_Nick> zachcando : what ubuntu distro are you using ... also what pc\
[04:23] <usr13> syntroPi:   Just use gmail contacts.  If you place a phone number on a gmail contact, it's there on your phone too.
[04:23] <syntroPi> usr13 i do know that, but i dont want that
[04:23] <usr13> syntroPi: And, again, I do not use evolution, the web based server works just fine. I suggest mail.google.com
[04:24] <usr13> syntroPi: I am telling you the best way to interact with your andorid
[04:25] <usr13> syntroPi: And;  The PC's OS is irrelevent
[04:25] <syntroPi> usr13 i tried all that and i know that this works flawlessly but i dont want google to have every bit of my social data.
[04:25] <usr13> syntroPi: Why not?
[04:25] <Tecan> http://i.imgur.com/6Saunms.jpg
[04:25] <dr_willis> They allready do have it all... ;P
[04:25] <dr_willis> Buahahahaha!
[04:26] <usr13> syntroPi:  Why does it matter?  Do you think ght google cares about your email and phone contacts?  Why would they?
[04:27] <syntroPi> usr13 because its not legal to give personal information away without permission and also i have no control over it anymore
[04:27] <usr13> *that not ght
[04:27] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> how come icant sudo apt-get install fix404
[04:27] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> says pkg not found
[04:28] <usr13> syntroPi: Why do you not have crontrol over it?  And how is it not legal?  (What you do on the internet is public. Right?)
[04:28] <syntroPi> usr13 and yes if they would be asked eg by the cia for support they have to cooperate with them. I have nothing to hide, but also i dont want to silently work for them by gathering social network data
[04:28] <cgkades> anyone have a link to a site with good ubuntu themed backgrounds?
[04:29] <usr13> syntroPi: Ok. If you have nothing to hide, it doesn't matter.  (You are not silently working for anyone.)
[04:29] <usr13> syntroPi: I think you are being overly suspicious.
[04:30] <syntroPi> usr13 well idk what they are doing with my data, and i cant know for sure it is really deleted when i request them to do so. i cant even ensure that with encryption and such
[04:30] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> how come I cant sudo apt-get install fix404 on ubuntu 11.10 (GNU/Linux 2.6.32-042stab063.2 x86_64)
[04:30] <syntroPi> usr13  on the contrary im sure most ppl nowerdays are by far not suspicious enough.
[04:31] <syntroPi> i thought linux oriented ppl would be the last to argue about that
[04:31] <usr13> syntroPi:  If you are that parinoid, you do not need to be on the internet, (and certainly not on IRC).  ;)
[04:32] <Darthearon> you could run your own mail server
[04:32] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: probably because support for that os has been discontinued
[04:32] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> it has?
[04:32] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> o.O
[04:32] <syntroPi> yes i intend to do that
[04:32] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: 12.04 is the newest LTS
[04:33] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> is their a way to update to that?
[04:33] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> without losing any files?
[04:33] <Rakko> Suddenly when I try to use apt-get install, it doesn't work. It says "404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.14 80]". I admit I'm still using 10.10; have the repositories for that been taken down finally?
[04:33] <usr13> syntroPi: You are making "a mountain out of a mole hill".  ;)
[04:33] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: you should have the option to do it. was 11.10 a LTS, or a regular release?
[04:33] <Darthearon> i have an ubuntu server in the cloud...gave it a domian name and now i proxy my traffic through it via ssh...im also paranoid (im in the military so i kinga have to be)
[04:33] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> not sure what LTS is
[04:33] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> but reguler i believe
[04:34] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: LTS is long term support
[04:34] <usr13> syntroPi: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_a_mountain_out_of_a_molehill  (a bit of humor...)
[04:34] <syntroPi> usr13 and why would i reject internet alltogether when i have a choice which information i share with what ppl. google is almost omnipresent today and that should raise suspicions
[04:34] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> then i dont think so cgkades  so theres a way to update without losing any data?
[04:34] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> how do i go on doing that
[04:34] <Darthearon> Whats wrong with google?
[04:34] <dr_willis> !upgrade
[04:34] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[04:35] <usr13> syntroPi: Well, you are going to go a long way around the block to hide something that does not need to be hidden. (IMHO)
[04:35] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  i would suggest backing up imporntant data befor trying a upgrade
[04:35] <Darthearon> you could update ubuntu with "sudo apt-get upgrade && dist-upgrade"
[04:35] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> well
[04:35] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: i'm not sure the upgrade options for 11.10. you might want to try to post that question on the forum if no one here can answer you. I know there ARE ways to upgrade, but i'm not sure their restrictions. usualy the update manager asks you if youw ant to upgrade to a newer release
[04:35] <dr_willis> !11.10
[04:35] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot) was the fifteenth release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1110
[04:35] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: yeah.. what Darthearon said
[04:35] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> well its on a vps
[04:35] <dr_willis> 11.10 is not eol yet is it?
[04:35] <dr_willis> a VPS? egads. ;)
[04:36] <Darthearon> what is VPS?
[04:36] <usr13> dr_willis: no
[04:36] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> virtual private server
[04:36] <Darthearon> is that like vpn?
[04:36] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> i can only see the virtual part of it not physcical
[04:36] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> so i cant back it up
[04:36] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> kinda
[04:36] <dr_willis> theres ways to back upyour stuff. ;)
[04:36] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> how
[04:36] <dr_willis> Now as for upgradeing it.. no idea
[04:36] <dr_willis> rsync the data to some local source
[04:36] <Darthearon> i agree with dr_willis there is also a way
[04:37] <syntroPi> usr13 but they cant combine all different identities i do use, and the phone numbers are very personal information which i dont want them to have. its nuff that they have all my email contacts.
[04:37] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> how would i restore it if i were to lose my data?
[04:37] <usr13> 11.10 and 10.04 EOL is same date.
[04:37] <dr_willis> rsync it back....
[04:37] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: what data exactly are you trying to get off? just /home/user data or configs and stuff?
[04:37] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> config's
[04:37] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> like eggdrop, znc
[04:37] <Darthearon> anyone here use slackware?
[04:38] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> it may be beast, not to mess with it
[04:38] <cgkades> Darthearon: i have, but dont
[04:38] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> best *
[04:38] <Rakko> Have the package repositories for 10.10 been taken down finally?
[04:38] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: if it's that critical...
[04:38] <Rakko> (I don't know if they normally get taken down at all; it might be that something is just not working)
[04:39] <cgkades> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: can you apt-get install anything?
[04:39] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> i can
[04:39] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> im just trying to fix an annoying glitch
[04:39] <dr_willis> !10.04
[04:39] <ubottu> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) was the twelfth release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004 - Supported until April 2013 (Desktop), April 2015 (Server)

[04:39] <Darthearon> why should i not use slackware cgkades?
[04:39] <dr_willis> so it will be going EOL for servers in 2015 ;)
[04:39] <Rakko> maybe that's the same problem I'm having, [_-S1L3NC3-_]
[04:39] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> i think so Rakko
[04:39] <usr13> syntroPi: Have it your way, but what you will have is separate data, (the sim card or the phone's memory, and your PC).  Now if you want to intergrate that data, well, I don't know if there is any sort of path for that sort of thing, (because there are other ways, (via internet), that we use and so there is not much use for anything else.
[04:39] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> ive tried to download pkg404

[04:41] <redengin> anyone that can help me debug these radeon drivers?
[04:41] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> read that Rakko
[04:41] <usr13> syntroPi: You can just transfer the data files back and forth and save it, but, well, I just don't see the point when there is a much easier way.
[04:41] <Rakko> dr_willis: oh... so the 10.10 packages should have been archived months ago
[04:41] <Rakko> thanks, [_-S1L3NC3-_]
[04:41] <Darthearon> cgkades: i am currently using xfce on slackware and i love it, its very fast
[04:41] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> ok
[04:41] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> Rakko f you get it to work tell me how
[04:41] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> if *
[04:42] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  that guide gives the exact commands to install that fix404 script.. could be its also 404  ;)
=== smacktalk1 is now known as imatech
[04:42] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> but it says pkg not found

[04:42] <usr13> syntroPi: I'm not going to pursue another path for all this because what I have is very convienient and it works.  I think you should just quit being so parinoid.
[04:43] <BlackWeb> Is there a way to rename a HardDrive Label without formatting from the command line: Normally I'd do `mkfs.ext3 -v -L "Volume-Name"`  But Dont want to erase the HD
[04:43] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  may be better for your 'critical' server to remove ppa's you dont need by hand.. and not trust some script
[04:43] <Rakko> I think tune2fs, BlackWeb
[04:43] <Coty91> I guys and gals. I'm having a problem with Ubuntu 12.10 and my displays. I have 2 graphics cards one which is an onboard AMD gpu and the other which is Nvidia GTX 550. What I'd like to do is have both work together to power 3 monitors, however, if that isn't possible, then having just the Nvidia GPU enabled and the AMD gpu disabled through software would be great. I'd rather not disable the onboard graphics through the BIOS bec
[04:43] <Coty91> ause of my Windows setup.
[04:43] <dr_willis> BlackWeb:  the Tune2fs command i Thought could change the label
[04:44] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> but i  dont know what ppa's i need
[04:44] <usr13> BlackWeb: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive
[04:44] <syntroPi> usr13 yes exporting/importing .vcf files can work for contacts but doing that manually is very annoying. I just want a local software path to do all those syncs automatically when i enter my homes wlan (as it were possible with old nokia phones for some decades)
[04:44] <Rakko> that script won't help, [_-S1L3NC3-_] ... it'll just remove any failing URLs
[04:44] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> oh
[04:44] <Darthearon> google it S1L3NC3
[04:44] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> i have
[04:44] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> im thinkin of just ignoring it
[04:45] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  its sort of scary when you have ppa's enabled that you dont know you need..  just disable them and see what happens perhaps..  or go through each one and determine what ones you really need
[04:45] <BlackWeb> Alright Thanks Rakko dr_willis & usr13 I'll browse the Manual And see if I can Figure it out Thankx :)
[04:45] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> ok
[04:46] <usr13> syntroPi: I've helped to keep this conversation alive for some time now in the hope that someone else (out of the 1700 or so others on here), may have some other idea's for you.  Apparently that is not the case.
[04:46] <Darthearon> so what is this paranoid person so parinoid about?
[04:46] <Coty91> Anyone know of a way to disable my onboard gpu through software? I want to use my Nvidia GPU only since I haven't been able to find a way to run both at the sametime.

[04:47] <nuf0xx> o/
[04:47] <nuf0xx> my seagate 1TB external drive stopped being recognised after a reboot
[04:47] <usr13> ... not sure really ...
[04:47] <nuf0xx> is not listed in the output of lsusb
[04:47] <DarthEaron> isnt everyone?
[04:47] <nuf0xx> any help?
[04:47] <dr_willis> nuf0xx:  how about sudo blkid ?
[04:47] <nuf0xx> not listed there either
[04:47] <dr_willis> nuf0xx:  unplug/plug it back in perhaps.. monitor dmesg output for error messages
[04:48] <nuf0xx> dr_willis: what would the be the best command to do that?

[04:50] <usr13> syntroPi: In other words, what we android users have with gmail intergration is good enough and looks as though there is not much intrest in doing anything more, (or re-inventing the wheel).
[04:50] <JamMyfacewithApp> Is it true I can't us the Ubuntu windows installer to install ubuntu (dualboot) if I'm running Windows 8?
[04:50] <Coty91> Really could use some input on this, please. :) I need to know a way to either have both amd and nvidia gpus work together to power 3 monitors or just have the nvidia gpu be my primary gpu without altering the BIOS.
[04:50] <dr_willis> Coty91:  if you use the open soruced drivers for both.. they Might work together
[04:51] <Coty91> dr_willis: I've tried the open source drivers and it only detected my onboard graphics for some reason, which is odd to me.
[04:51] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  its worth learning how to remove the ppa's in question by hand.. youve spent more time trying to get a script going  then it would have for you to remove them by hand
[04:51] <usr13> Coty91: Is one on-board and the onter an add-on card?
[04:52] <Coty91> usr13: Yea
[04:52] <Coty91> I've tried blacklisting the drivers, too. No luck
[04:52] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> ive removed all of them
[04:52] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> and same thing
[04:52] <usr13> Coty91: It's been my experience that most BIOS's just revert to the add-on when present.
[04:52] <JamMyfacewithApp>  Is it true I can't us the Ubuntu windows installer to install ubuntu (dualboot) if I'm running Windows 8?
[04:52] <syntroPi> usr13 google already did reinvent the wheel as all others did (MS exchange, apple webcal? caldav whats it called again?, Nokias SyncML (which is a standart imho) and so on and so forth. Its nice to have those choices, therefore i can prefer syncml
[04:53] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> in the /etc/apt/sources.list u mean?
[04:53] <Coty91> usr13: I have the onboard set as default in the BIOS because of my Windows install. Windows won't detect the onboard GPU if I don't.
[04:53] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  or in sources.list.d
[04:54] <usr13> Coty91: Sorry abotu the MS Windows problem, that is unfortunate.
[04:54] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> nothing in sources.list.d
[04:54] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> but I deleted everything in sources and same thing
[04:54] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  deleted what exactly?
[04:54] <Coty91> usr13: I wouldn't use it if I could
[04:54] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> all the deb files
[04:54] <nuf0xx> dr_willis: no messages there. the only thing that happens is the light goes on the drive
[04:54] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> and removing individual ones

[04:55] <Coty91> usr13: So, do you know of a way where I could at least disable the onboard GPU or change my primary GPU in a configuration file?
[04:55] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  so you deleted all the lines from your /etc/apt/sources.list  file?
[04:56] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> yes
[04:56] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  and the file is blank?
[04:56] <nuf0xx> thanks
[04:56] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> yes

[04:56] <dfboneguru> i recently switched from windows, trying to retrieve things off my hdd backup. is there a way besides manually combing through all the .zips?
[04:56] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:   then you got a really screwed up system.  since it shouldent be updateing at all.
[04:57] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  and theres nothing at all in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ ?

[05:11] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> thats what i did

[05:16] <dr_willis> see the ~ ?
[05:16] <dr_willis> :)
[05:17] <dr_willis> use the 'ls' command to look at what files are where you are at... if you dont see the file you want to move.. you must use a full proper path to it.
[05:17] <dr_willis> if this is all totally confuseing. I suggest spending 30 min reading some bash beginner guides.
[05:17] <dr_willis> !bash
[05:17] <ubottu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome), K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE), or Menu -> Accessories -> LXTerminal (LXDE). Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal

[05:18] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> oh i need to be in the directory to move it
[05:18] <usr13> [_-S1L3NC3-_]: pwd
[05:18] <dr_willis> and you did not use the path to the file.
[05:18] <dr_willis> OR use the full path.. like we have been saying fopr the last 15 min....
[05:19] <dr_willis> makes sence. :)
[05:19] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> ooooo
[05:19] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> didnt know there was a directory their

[05:21] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> thats not very intuitive

[05:24] <dr_willis> [_-S1L3NC3-_]:  YOU were the one that decided to remove all lines in your sources.list earlier. No one told you to do that.. I asked if you had a backup of that file.
[05:25] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> i did

[06:08] <chalcedony> Tex_Nick, he has what he wants i just have to figure out how to help

[06:08] <ubottu> The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[06:08] <chalcedony> Tex_Nick, he has no sound. going through steps with it, system > preferences > sound.. still nada
[06:10] <dr_willis> hmm
[06:10] <dr_willis> !sound
[06:10] <ubottu> If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[06:10] <chalcedony> histo, he had a very severe stroke in 1999, miracle is that he can do it at all
[06:10] <dr_willis> If hes using HDMI out - ive had to twiddle with the pavucontrol tool also

[06:15] <hhhzzzain> i have forgotten but is #ubuntu-offtopic the correct name of the official channel?
[06:15] <nuf0xx> i believe it is the bcmwl driver

[06:16] <hhhzzzain> i have finally switched to KDE today [don't judge a book by its cover]

[06:17] <chalcedony> hi hi Flannel :))
[06:17] <phunyguy> I am trying out autofs, is there any way to avoid the long hang that occurs on a network disconnect, mainly in nautilus?
[06:17] <Flannel> chalcedony: Howdy
[06:18] <chalcedony> he's looking at the manual
[06:18] <chalcedony> it's for 12.10.. if he does the upgrade would it break things?
[06:19] <iter> I like idling/helping in here
[06:19] <dr_willis> most of the manual should be identical chalcedony
[06:19] <iter> you can always learn something new
[06:19] <dr_willis> there might be a 12.04 manual also
[06:19] <dr_willis> Im actually suprprised the manual is updated for 12.10 ;)
[06:22] <Tex_Nick> chalcedony : this might seem lame, but youTube has some really good vids relating to all things linux, ubuntu, bash ... etc.
[06:22] <dr_willis> i also recall some Ubuntu training video web pages.. but havent looked at them in ages

[06:26] <Lofde_> whats the terminal command to figure out which version of ubuntu this is running..
[06:26] <dr_willis> !version
[06:26] <ubottu> To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type « lsb_release -a » in a !shell - To know the available version of a package, « apt-cache policy <package> »
[06:27] <Lofde_> eh its saying no lsb modules are avaiable distrubutor linaro 12.07, codename precise..
[06:27] <dr_willis> there ya go.
[06:28] <dr_willis> not a standard ubuntu sounds  like. ;)
[06:28] <FluxD> Hi, for the second time in 2 days, my ubuntu laptop suddently will lock up, then screen go blank and become unsuable. Doing a hard reboot fixes it. Any ideas?
[06:28] <shortstraw8> Has anyone successfully downloaded and installed dropbox on 12.04? If so how
[06:28] <Lofde_> nah i was trying to find out what the base ubuntu verison was.. they recomplied an extra kernel module i am guessing for the arm processor on this mini pc for it to work faster..
[06:29] <phunyguy> shortstraw8, a better question would be to tell us what error you get specifically
[06:29] <phunyguy> also-dropbox is in the repos.
[06:30] <shortstraw8> phunyguy, The command the give on the website says cannot be found and if I DL it it will not open. Not sure what is going on.
[06:30] <phunyguy> !info nautilus-dropbox | shortstraw8
[06:30] <ubottu> shortstraw8: nautilus-dropbox (source: nautilus-dropbox): Dropbox integration for Nautilus. In component multiverse, is optional. Version 1.4.0-3 (quantal), package size 93 kB, installed size 366 kB (Only available for i386; amd64)
[06:31] <Lofde_> The currently Ubuntu builds here are build using "armel", however the A10 supports armhf, which is said to be significantly faster.
[06:31] <phunyguy> shortstraw8, "sudo apt-get install nautilus-dropbox", or just search for it in software center
[06:32] <Rakko> does nautilus-dropbox work with things other than nautilus?
[06:33] <grendal-prime> is it me or is the default integrated vnc server that ships now ..blows.
[06:34] <shortstraw8> phunyguy, Thanks not sure what I did wrong but it worked that time
[06:34] <grendal-prime> considerably!
=== TheRainbowDusk is now known as TheRainbowDawn
[06:34] <phunyguy> grendal-prime, I have no issues with it
[06:35] <Rakko> vnc sucks period
[06:35] <grendal-prime> ive tried a myriad of clients now none of them help the situation.  but if i log into these machines and run like x11vnc.  man they refresh snappy and everything
[06:36] <phunyguy> grendal-prime, can't disagree with you there, but I found, since I generally connect over the local network, I just disable encryption, and all is well.
[06:36] <phunyguy> (on the client end)
[06:36] <grendal-prime> rakko well ya..accept for x11vnc has alot of options you can speed and clean it up with...but i like the handy user side for my customers.
[06:37] <grendal-prime> they like..it
[06:37]  * Tex_Nick uses vnc on 12.10 to monitor security cams for a few customers ... no problems here
[06:37] <phunyguy> grendal-prime, are you asking how to fix it? or are you just complaining?
[06:37] <dr_willis> i never share the 'current' desktop - i always use stand alone/hidden vnc sessions
[06:37] <grendal-prime> ill tell you what they dont like and thats the mear idea that someone can jut be watching what they are doing and them not having the quasi belive they can adjust that.
[06:37] <Rakko> I should look into ways to optimize vnc
[06:37] <Rakko> I used to have some tricks but I lost them
[06:38] <Rakko> one thing I was able to do but can't figure out now was to use 256 shades of gray
[06:38] <grendal-prime> phunyguy im just wondering if there is some way of adjusting the current integrated servers performance
[06:38] <Rakko> didn't look as horrible as 256 colors but was faster than 16- or 24-bit color
[06:38] <SaidKLE> ...cause that's much better than 50...
[06:38] <phunyguy> grendal-prime, the server supports what the client tells it to support.  256 colors, 16 bit, 24 bit, jpeg compression or not, encrypted or not... etc
[06:39] <Lofde_> does lubuntu use openbox ?
[06:39] <grendal-prime> ooo i got a better idea..lets figure out the 50 shades of gray alternaitive lense on this thang!
[06:39] <phunyguy> grendal-prime, this is becoming offtopic.
[06:40] <grendal-prime> phunyguy   anyway...um ok, so maybe i try disabling encryption. the big problem i have is the refresh
[06:40] <grendal-prime> it just doesnt do it.
[06:40] <phunyguy> grendal-prime, that was an issue I was able to avoid with disabling encryption
[06:40] <dandaman> real men use 10.04
[06:40] <grendal-prime> ok..well that would make sence cause im pretty sure x11vnc is not using it.
[06:40] <Rakko> hehe
[06:40] <phunyguy> not sure if the issue is client or server side, but I am leaning towards client
[06:40] <Rakko> I still use 10.10
[06:40] <Rakko> I like the number
[06:41] <grendal-prime> no its server
[06:41] <phunyguy> grendal-prime, I wouldn't be so sure
[06:41] <grendal-prime> i can connect with remmina to both servers..and the out of the box integrated..blows.  but...the x11vnc works wonderful
[06:42] <phunyguy> like you said, x11vnc may not use encryption, thus disabling the client's ability to use it's own broken encryption.
[06:42] <grendal-prime> phunyguy ya well ive been trying every client i get my hands on and all the same results
[06:42] <phunyguy> fair enoug.
[06:42] <phunyguy> +h
[06:44] <grendal-prime> nope ..same issue
[06:44] <grendal-prime> hmm bummer
[06:44] <iony> hola
[06:44] <iony> hola??
[06:45] <grendal-prime> see ya?

[06:47] <hhhzzzain> iony, Yo no soy de Argentina
[06:47] <grendal-prime> its a desktop distro that im running the vnc server on
[06:48] <grendal-prime> but..hey ill give it a shot..thanks
[06:48] <Lofde_> a piece of software i need to install in ubuntu is on the mfgers website they have an ARM version for armel but not armhf ... would i have to compile it from source.. or do i need to contact the manfuature any suggestions
[06:48] <Tex_Nick> grendal-prime : i've seen some good discussion there in the past regarding vnc :)
[06:49] <elky> hhhzzzain, next time see if there is a loco team portal like http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-ar

[07:25] <islan> Tecan, it's the new winamp?
[07:25] <dr_willis> Syria:  ive not used it in ages.. so no idea on that. its worked for me in the past

[07:30] <Tecan> also make sure its in a usb 2 socket
[07:30] <zuumbi> Hi there Im having problem with my inbuilt webcam and the microfone, does anyone nows, waht vcan be done?
[07:30] <Tecan> and maybe its just the dongle
[07:30] <corenot> Me got a problem with Nvidia crappy drivers running compiz........does anyone have same problems.......
[07:30] <Tecan> try several
[07:31] <islan> is it normal for that to return "stop: Rejected send message, 1 matched rules: ..."?
[07:31] <islan> Tecan, it's onboard bluetooth
[07:31] <Syria> corenot: I have the libk3b6-extracodecs already installed but I can't find something like create a new mp3 project in k3b!
[07:31] <Tecan> try a dongle
[07:31] <islan> so I should just go out and buy a dongle?
[07:31] <dr_willis> Syria:  it would be create new audio cd.
[07:31] <Tecan> ebay
[07:32] <Tecan> pick one up for 2 - 4 bux
[07:32] <dr_willis> a mp3 cd - would be a normal data cd.
[07:32] <islan> that's kind of a shame, one of the requirements I had for picking out this laptop was that it needed to have bluetooth
[07:32] <islan> oh well
[07:32] <Syria> dr_willis:  A new audio CD has a limit which is 80 mins. and a data cd will not be played.
[07:32] <corenot> Syria: ++1 dr.willis.............you dont need codecs.
[07:32] <Tecan> that might not be the prob but try and see
[07:32] <iml> lot of cars play mp3cds fwiw
[07:33] <dr_willis> Syria:  My Car has a Hard drive. ;) and 2 usb ports for flash drives...
[07:33] <dr_willis> ;P
[07:33] <Tecan> my car has a big block
[07:33] <Syria> Lucky you :P
[07:33] <dr_willis> Syria:  if the car cant play mp3 files from a data cd.. then you use a 80 min audio cd...
[07:33] <youbuntour> Hi, got a security related question - what is the chance that someone who knows my IP could beak into a booted ubuntu live? I'm asking because still there could be personal data on my hard drive
[07:33] <corenot> so why not use flash drive in your car .............who uses cd.............My CAR has turntables and a dj studio!
[07:34] <Tecan> lol
[07:34] <dr_willis> My Car can rip the audio cd to the HD i belive.. ;) not tried it
[07:34] <Tecan> corenot you can pimp my ride anyday
[07:34] <DarthEaron> how did you power the computer?
[07:34] <corenot> Tecan : You Bet bro
[07:35] <corenot> read PS4 will have AMD APU
[07:36] <corenot> 6800k crossfire with 100GB blueray
[07:36] <corenot> :}}}}
[07:39] <youbuntour> I was wondering how secure a live boot actually is given that sudo doesn't ask for any password etc particularly when there's a hard drive which can be mounted and which stored valuable personal data
[07:39] <JugglerLKR> hi
[07:40] <JugglerLKR> any pptpd server guru here by chance?
[07:41] <corenot> im ftp guru nor pptpd nor dpptdp
[07:41] <corenot> Give me your IP youbuntour. I can check;))
[07:42] <youbuntour> corenot: currently it's not running :( is there a good way to check it?
[07:43] <corenot> what is not running. your carburettor or network??
[07:44] <Rakko> youbuntour: it's not secure
[07:45] <corenot> Nobody can break into your network......and why do care unless you got docs for napalm
[07:46] <vnc786> how do i remove/add shortcut to unity launcher through command line ? ubuntu 12.04
[07:47] <corenot> Never used Unity as much ....dont care either. If it works it works, why bother

[07:48] <IdleOne> !behelpful | corenot Tecan
[07:48] <ubottu> corenot Tecan: As our !guidelines say, "When helping, be helpful". If you're not familiar with the issue at hand, let someone else handle it instead of making !offtopic comments or jokes.
[07:48] <iml> vnc786: /usr/share/applications
[07:48] <Tecan> i was testing something
[07:49] <IdleOne> Tecan: use #test instead
[07:49] <corenot> Sorry Ubottu got carried away..........Tecan that looks like binary hieroglyphs.
[07:49] <iml> or ~/.local/share/applications for the user
[07:50] <corenot> is there a channel where i can crack jokes??
[07:50] <lasers> #defocus, perhaps.
[07:50] <corenot> danke
[07:50] <corenot> #defocus
[07:51] <aeon-ltd> corenot: /j mein freund
[07:51] <corenot> wie gehts
[07:51] <aeon-ltd> corenot: gut danke, und du?
[07:51] <youbuntour> Rakko: do you know by chance to which extent it's not secure (whether some more sophisticated techniques are needed such as rootkits exploits or whether it's like an open door to invite anyone)
[07:52] <Rakko> Well I mean if sudo doesn't ask for a password, that's insecure obviously
[07:52] <corenot> sehr gut......i habe Deutsch gelernt.......i spreche ein bischen deutsch, aber nicht so gut.
[07:52] <youbuntour> corenot: I'm curious :)
[07:52] <Tex_Nick> !de
[07:52] <ubottu> In den meisten Ubuntu-Kanälen wird nur Englisch gesprochen. Für deutschsprachige Hilfe besuche bitte #ubuntu-de, #kubuntu-de, #edubuntu-de oder #ubuntu-at. Einfach "/join #ubuntu-de" eingeben. Danke für Dein Verständnis!
[07:53] <iml> youbuntour: it's because the default user on the livecd has no password, simple as that
[07:53] <IdleOne> off topic chit chat in #ubuntu-offtopic please
[07:53] <Rakko> but I'm not a security expert by any means
[07:53] <youbuntour> Rakko: np, thanks for help :)
[07:53] <corenot> Unless you have technical expertise its pointless. SElinux,nmap and ethereal can get you through......but you need to know c and python
[07:53] <spill00> hi.  I'm having trouble getting flash plugin working in firefox on ubuntu 10.04.4 .. I've been googlin for a while.  can anyone help? much thx
[07:54] <youbuntour> iml: does it mean someone can log into a live boot remotely and become root?
[07:54] <IdleOne> no
[07:54] <corenot> Sorry ubottu
[07:54] <corenot> youbuntour: NO
[07:55] <iml> I don't think ssh server is installed on the livecd
[07:55] <todd_> for the love of god... can somebody please freaking tell me how to open the configuration program for the Unity 12.10 window manager
[07:55] <corenot> its not that simple anymore. Routers handle all that multiplexing stuff. They know which kind of 2 way connection is real and phony
[07:55] <todd_> i just want to try turning on "focus follows mouse" like my textbook says to try
[07:57] <youbuntour> iml, corenot: ok, thanks :)
[07:57] <helmut_> hi
[07:58] <todd_> anyone?
[07:58] <dr_willis> todd_:  that often dosent work very well with unity. saw the setting in some tweak tool/config somewhere... havent wanted that in years
[07:59] <todd_> arg... why does unix have to make everything so insanely difficult
[07:59] <dr_willis> todd_:  thats nothing to do with unix.
[07:59] <aeon-ltd> todd_: have you ever tried modifyig core parts of windows?
[07:59] <corenot> its linux not unix
[07:59] <aeon-ltd> todd_: believe me the openness is much better
[08:00] <todd_> so i need to go on a scavenger hunt for a tweak tool just to change a simple setting to turn on "focus follows mouse"
[08:00] <dr_willis> quick google search for 'unity focus follows mouse'  http://www.iloveubuntu.net/how-easily-enable-focus-follows-mouse-behavior-ubuntu-unsettings
[08:00] <dr_willis> took me 10 sec to find. ;)
[08:00] <corenot> Game programmers hate windows and are pushed to program for windows because of bread and butter. Linux is like sweet potato pie
[08:00] <IdleOne> todd_: install compizconfig-settings-manager and you should be able to enable that setting under the Unity plugin.
[08:01] <dr_willis> it may be in other tweaker tools/areas also
[08:01] <Tex_Nick> todd : see if this helps ... http://askubuntu.com/questions/64605/how-do-i-set-focus-follows-mouse
[08:01] <aeon-ltd> corenot: not to derail much, but opengl wasn't so great a while ago. drivers for hardware in general sucked because there was no incentive to develop them.
[08:01] <dr_willis> http://askubuntu.com/questions/64605/how-do-i-set-focus-follows-mouse
[08:01] <dr_willis> ;)
[08:01] <todd_> I tried searching.. for over 30 minutes now, hence why I'm here.  I was just awestruck that no site said how to do it without required a litany of download/installation options
[08:01] <todd_> i will try that link you posted though
[08:02] <dr_willis> Err.. took me 20 sec to find iton google..
[08:02] <dr_willis> normally i check askubuntu.com first
[08:03] <dr_willis> I imagine you will be sick of it within 5 min.
[08:05] <todd_> Frustrated is more the proper term, never have I seen something so difficult to navigate and use
[08:05] <dr_willis> not sure what you are talking about.. but come back if you have another support question.
[08:07] <aeon-ltd> todd_: but you change everything....
[08:07] <tion> uber is out
[08:07] <aeon-ltd> *can
[08:08] <corenot> anyone for tea??
[08:08] <tion> were can i install them for E17
[08:08] <tion> were can i install themes for E17?
[08:09] <todd_> typing "sudo apt-get install unsettings" doesn't appear to work
[08:09] <todd_> just comes up with "unable to loacate package unsettings"
[08:09] <aeon-ltd> tion: ~/.e/themes/e/themes ~/.e/e/themes then you use the switcher
[08:10] <Tex_Nick> corenot : hey man, please thak the chit-chat to #ubuntu-offtopic
[08:10] <tion> can i remove avahi deamon?
[08:10] <Tex_Nick> take*
[08:11] <dr_willis> http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/11/unsettings-a-comprehensive-tweaking-tool-for-unity  has a download link
[08:12] <gipzo> Hello. What is the best way to manage power in ubuntu server? I need to power on and power off at certain time. Now I'm using rtcwake and cron. But I have problems with electricity and pc starts too early sometimes...
[08:12] <nighthawknz> hello anyone alive?
[08:12] <tion> every time i browse all apps this crashes and i have to press f1
[08:12] <dr_willis> 1000+ people in here nighthawknz
[08:13] <deebo> how do i install some meta package to tell apps that java is already installed (by me)
[08:13] <deebo> i need to install libreoffice but it wants to install java + dependencies, and i really really really dont need them
[08:13] <tion> segv very bad :)
[08:13] <aeon-ltd> gipzo: wake on lan? then you wake via another pc
[08:13] <aeon-ltd> deebo: dependencies means you need them
[08:14] <gipzo> aeon-ltd: it's standalone server on the street
[08:14] <nighthawknz> anyone know how to add hyperv support to kernel
[08:14] <tion> can i ad bohdin linux repo to update e17?
[08:14] <gipzo> aeon-ltd: i have wake on power switched on, so sometimes it turns on at night
[08:14] <dr_willis> tion:  mixing in other disrto repos can cause big issues.  There may be E17 PPAs out there
[08:15] <deebo> aeon-ltd: yeah i know that, but i have already met the dependencies outside the package system, i dont want to install openjdk, i can't use it and don't want it
[08:15] <mokush> is there are way to still use the packages from getdeb/playdeb from somewhere else, now that the actual service is discontinued?
[08:15] <deebo> i need to tell the package system that the dependency for java is already met
[08:15] <JoseeAntonioR> hey guys, I'm having some problem, after reinstalling nvidia-current and rebooting I have no unity
[08:15] <tion> how big ?
[08:16] <iml> deebo: try --nodeps flag
[08:16] <dr_willis> tion:  we cant say.. they could have most anything in their disrtos.
[08:16] <tion> dr_willis, i can just update the e17 related stuff?
[08:16] <gipzo> I can check time at startup and then set rtcwake and shutdown. But I thought that somebody already did this
[08:17] <JoseeAntonioR> Basically, what it says to me it's Compiz (opengl) - Fatal: glXQueryExtensionsString is NULL for screen 0
[08:18] <dr_willis> tion:  thats what a e17 PPA would do most likely
[08:18] <tion> thats what ive installed but i want to add the repos
[08:18] <tion> from official site
[08:19] <dr_willis> if they have PPA's for ubuntu - then you can add them and update e17
[08:19] <tion> some ppa instaled a key that dosent work :)
[08:28] <himanshu_linux> hi , i have made a "standard" account on my ubuntu 12.04 , but when i do some sudo work it does not accept the password. So i am going to covert this new account to admins too . I am asking whether it will create a conflict with existing administrator account ???
[08:29] <dr_willis> himanshu_linux:  no it shouldent
[08:30] <himanshu_linux> dr_willis : but previous time I made an account like this i had to reinstall everything .
[08:30] <dr_willis> himanshu_linux:  Noidea what you did. but you can have more then  1 user whohas sudo rights
[08:30] <TakeItEZ> himanshu_linux: did you add the created account to the group "sudo"?
[08:31] <dr_willis> the only differance btween a user with standaard vs admin rights is that they belong to the sudo group  i belive
[08:31] <TakeItEZ> himanshu_linux: to be able to use sudo, the user needs to be member of that group (it was group "admin" before 12.04)
[08:32] <himanshu_linux> TakeItEZ :  i have right now made a simple standard account from account setting
[08:32] <TakeItEZ> himanshu_linux: "groups username"
[08:32] <TakeItEZ> himanshu_linux: does it list "sudo" or "admin"?
[08:33] <corenot> Hi himanshu, on local machine it wont touch admin password on server.
=== ident is now known as Guest50248
[08:34] <himanshu_linux> TakeItEZ :it says  nopasswdlogin  i have not set password .
[08:34] <tion> e17 isnt drag n drop friendly
[08:34] <ikonia> tion: who are you telling this to ?
[08:34] <tion> lxde is the best
[08:35] <TakeItEZ> himanshu_linux: hrm, to use sudo the account needs a password
[08:35] <ikonia> tion: who are you telling this to ?
[08:35] <tion> to everybody
[08:35] <himanshu_linux> TakeItEZ : i know that
[08:35] <tion> why?
[08:35] <ikonia> tion: everyone doesn't need to know, no-one was asking for help with that.
=== daniel is now known as Guest54737
[08:35] <ikonia> tion: please keep that sort of thing to yourself unless someone is asking for information/help
[08:36] <Guest54737> good afternoon .
[08:36] <tion> cant say bad things about anything
[08:37] <dr_willis> Ibet theres an E17 channel somewhere on this server. ;)
[08:37] <tion> hackers
[08:37] <dr_willis> They may want your feedback
[08:37] <TakeItEZ> if no #e17, there might be #whocares
[08:37] <DrManhattan> is it possible to cluster three ubuntu boxes with mosix and then run virtualbox with a windows 7 VM on it so I can have a 12 core VM?
[08:38] <ikonia> tion: errr no, you can't fill the channel with pointless information/views, hence why I've asked you not to, unless someone is asking for that information
[08:38] <DrManhattan> I have two q6600 boxes and Im probably going to get an 8 core AMD box, so maybe 14-15 cores on the VM
[08:39] <ikonia> DrManhattan: I wouldn't bother if I where
[08:39] <ikonia> where you
[08:39] <tion> im asking why isnt e17 more drag n drop friendly because i cant drag icons from the menu to the lunch br
[08:39] <ikonia> DrManhattan: what is the reason for the clustering
[08:39] <DrManhattan> ikonia, why not?
[08:39] <tion> thats pretty backwards
[08:39] <ikonia> tion: this channel doesn't make e17 - ask the e17 developers why they don't put the features in you want
[08:39] <DrManhattan> ikonia, heavy duty CPU based video editing and rendering
[08:39] <himanshu_linux> TakeItEZ : actually i am working on python script that requires a sudo password while running it. so i am working on a account that is standard . so even if i write the actual sudo password it does not accept there .
[08:40] <ikonia> DrManhattan: ok, so you're unlikley to get much benifit from this
[08:40] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I have used CUDA and its nice but for pure quality its still best to have a lot of CPU power and patience
[08:40] <ikonia> DrManhattan: you're on home user hardware, that sort of load distribtuion requires enterprise class stuff,
[08:40] <shortstraw8> What do I need to do to get my repository to show on local host after I commit and then restart apache, do I have to do anything with /var/www
[08:40] <DrManhattan> ikonia, really? Cinelerra does it
[08:40] <ikonia> DrManhattan: and the overhead for example of splitting a virtual machines cpu cycles over 3 boxes on a home network would be slower than than actually just using one of the machines nativly.
[08:41] <DrManhattan> Holy crap - I totally forgot about cinelerra
[08:41] <tion> why cant i drag windows from one desk to the next like with e17?
[08:41] <corenot> i have fx 8350
[08:41] <ikonia> DrManhattan: for distribution of load in a "chunk" like format, it will be great
[08:41] <himanshu_linux> TakeItEZ : so just asking that after converting that this new account to admins from "setting" will it create a problem ?
[08:41] <ikonia> DrManhattan: for distribtuion of real time processing, you will see a reduction not improvement
[08:41] <DrManhattan> ikonia, yeah you know I'll only use it to output raw video to different formats and make it look insanely good
[08:42] <tion> why cant i drag windows across desktops with unity?
[08:42] <DrManhattan> ikonia, You're right, it's way better to just let it render out the video job, it's a lot more suited to clustering
[08:42] <ikonia> DrManhattan: ok, so to try be a bit more helpful from my view point, you'll get benifit from distrubtion of "chunks" processes such as rendering, but for things like vm's you'll end up being crippled
[08:42] <corenot> enable or install compiz / make sure you have installer the gpu drivers for your card if any
[08:43] <TakeItEZ> himanshu_linux: well, oyu stated last time you did it like this, you b0rked your installation. so you seem to do something wrong
[08:43] <ikonia> DrManhattan: a better explination ?
[08:43] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I agree and thanks for talking some sense into me - it's not even necessary to do the VM, I can even do it the other way around
[08:43] <ikonia> DrManhattan: I think you'll get much better results that way
[08:43] <tion> can i unistall bonjour err remove avahi ?
[08:43] <ikonia> tion: yes,
[08:43] <himanshu_linux> TakeItEZ : hmm i think too
[08:43] <ikonia> tion: if there are packages for it, do just that
[08:43] <dr_willis> tion:  one way. click on the workspace switcher and you can
[08:44] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I can set up Ubuntu VM's with Cinelerra, which has its own network rendering resource
[08:44] <DrManhattan> the VM overhead is really minimal now anyhow
[08:44] <TakeItEZ> himanshu_linux: and thats why i mentioned the group your user needs to be member of to gain sudo-access and how to check
[08:44] <tion> unity is too heavy
[08:44] <dr_willis> tion:  never really noticed.
[08:44] <ikonia> DrManhattan: in that situation the overhead is null, as it's chunk processing, why do it in vm's though ? why not use two native hosts ?
[08:44] <tion> any way lxde or e17 work ok still ff is slower that in windows
[08:44] <ikonia> tion: don't use it - stop complaining about things
[08:45] <ikonia> tion: if you want help - ask questions, if you want to moan, do it in another chanel
[08:45] <ikonia> channel
[08:45] <dr_willis> cant say ive noticed FF being slower on ubuntu then windows
[08:45] <corenot> e17 works goog
[08:45] <nighthawknz> can anyone tell me how to add hyperv to kernel
[08:45] <DrManhattan> ikonia, so I can go into an office building and run VM's or run native clients off of USB sticks
[08:45] <corenot> nope FF works just fine
[08:45] <himanshu_linux> TakeItEZ : got your point
[08:45] <ikonia> DrManhattan: run clients off USB sticks !!!!! are you mad, you want performance
[08:45] <tion> what windows?
[08:46] <DrManhattan> ikonia, anything with a gigabit network and a bunch of workstations and I can render out whatever I need
[08:46] <tion> i mean XP
[08:46] <DrManhattan> ikonia, just the nodes
[08:46] <ikonia> nighthawknz: hyperv is a windows product, it will not work in linux
[08:46] <ikonia> DrManhattan: what do you mean the nodes ?
[08:46] <DrManhattan> ikonia, the main workstation would be a native ubuntu workstation
[08:46] <COUGAR60> hi all
[08:46] <tion> My XP setup is faster that linux
[08:46] <ikonia> DrManhattan: yes, but running an OS from the USB device will = slower performance
[08:46] <ikonia> tion: do you need help, yes/no
[08:46] <DrManhattan> ikonia, in cinelerra you can use other computers as nodes on a rendering cluster and it's built into the program
[08:47] <ikonia> DrManhattan: yes, but still running the OS from a usb stick......bad idea, especially if you are looking for performance
[08:47] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I doubt it, the node client program doesn't even use a GUI as far as I know
[08:47] <ikonia> DrManhattan: ahh, so you don't want to run the whole OS from usb ?
[08:47] <tion> i was here for help the other day and no onw could fix it
[08:48] <Ben64> tion: so you decided to come here and complain?
[08:48] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I would but all it uses for the node client is network/cpu/ram, it uses no HD resources that I know of
[08:48] <ikonia> tion: that dosn't mean keep complaining, ask again and see if someone else can help
[08:48] <majnoon> there IS hyperv stuff in kernel BUT it so can use linux in windows hyperv environment as a GUEST
[08:48] <ikonia> DrManhattan: so just to be clear, you are not running the OS from the USB disk
[08:48] <tion> im not even going to have to go thru it allover again
[08:48] <ikonia> tion: then please be quiet
[08:48] <DrManhattan> ikonia, the file is still written to the main workstation, the rendering jobs are chopped into chunks and sent to the nodes
[08:49] <tion> allready sent the bugs reportes
[08:49] <ikonia> tion: then please be quiet
[08:49] <majnoon> DrManhattan, you have vmware player ?
[08:49] <khameis> hi
[08:49] <khameis> h r u
[08:49] <DrManhattan> ikonia, for the nodes I WOULD like to run the OS off of a USB stick and probably use a generic kernel , but on my home cluster I will run it all natively off of its own partitions
[08:50] <majnoon> <-- running full ubuntu from usb pendrive
[08:50] <khameis> i am new user ubuntu
[08:50] <ikonia> DrManhattan: running the OS from a USB device when you want quick access, is a bad call
[08:50] <khameis> is there any arabic person???????????????????????
[08:50] <ikonia> DrManhattan: (based on what you've said you want)
[08:50] <DrManhattan> ikonia, the difference being with usb sticks I can go into one of my friends offices and just use Ubuntu via USB and run the node client.
[08:51] <aeon-ltd> !arabic
[08:51] <ubottu> For Arabic language support, please : /join #ubuntu-arabic : للحصول على الدعم باللغة العربية
[08:51] <majnoon> ikonia, i'm doing what he wants now
[08:51] <khameis> who is arabic write????????????????????????
[08:51] <ikonia> DrManhattan: I appreciate what you are trying to do, but you are also moving away from what you initially wanted which was quick performance for distributed processing
[08:51] <ikonia> majnoon: so ?
[08:51] <DrManhattan> Im sure there will be some minimal performance loss due to the use of a generic kernel but what the heck man, some of this guys offices have 100 core2duo's and core2quads in them
[08:51] <majnoon> it possible
[08:51] <ikonia> DrManhattan: it's not about the generic kernel
[08:51] <khameis> ????????????????????????
[08:51] <majnoon> DrManhattan, you have vmware player ?
[08:51] <khameis> pls
[08:52] <DrManhattan> maknz, yes
[08:52] <beowulf2> anyone know any good electronic music composition software for linux?
[08:52] <elfranne> DrManhattan, the problem is the USB
[08:52] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I suppose I could do it with a stack of CD's then - it certainly would be cheap
[08:52] <ikonia> DrManhattan: the CD's would still be the problem
[08:52] <mvt007geek> khameis: go to your language room.here is not Middle East >:o
[08:52] <DrManhattan> ikonia, WHY?
[08:53] <elfranne> DrManhattan, unless you have USB3 .... CD would be worse
[08:53] <majnoon> in vmware player load usb as a hd install ubuntu to it as if it was a regular hd
[08:53] <ikonia> DrManhattan: you're using very slow IO and a lot of ram to load the OS and run the OS
[08:53] <ikonia> DrManhattan: therefore you'd be bottlenecked by that and thus slow down your node performance
[08:53] <ikonia> majnoon: no-one is saying you can't use a USB, we are saying it's not fit for purpose for his needs
[08:53] <majnoon> wubi prob be better i think for that then
[08:53] <ikonia> no it would not
[08:54] <ikonia> wubi would be the worse possible solusiton
[08:54] <DrManhattan> ikonia, but all the OS is doing is running the kernel and the node client. It's a pretty simple thing. it isnt going to be wiring back and forth to the device that the OS is loaded from that much - in fact, I'd probably run the OS itself from a ramdisk
[08:54] <mvt007geek> majnoon: where is leili? ;)
[08:54] <ikonia> DrManhattan: that's not all it's doing
[08:54] <ikonia> DrManhattan: that's what it "looks" like it's doing, but that's not all it does
[08:54] <DrManhattan> wirign - writing
[08:54] <majnoon> though i DID find one problem with wubi and windows 8 (not a major one)
[08:54] <ikonia> it will require disk IO access just to "live"
[08:55] <DrManhattan> ikonia, then ramdisk it is
[08:55] <ikonia> majnoon: no-one is asking about wubi
[08:55] <ikonia> DrManhattan: ok, so now you go into the next level of possible problem in that your whole OS will be in ram.....do you want to use/waste that ram holding the whole os, or use it for node processing
[08:55] <DrManhattan> I've yet to see a linux distro that wasn't capable of being REALLY lightweight - xubuntu on a ramdisk
[08:56] <DrManhattan> ikonia, honestly - it depends on how small I can get the OS
[08:56] <aeon-ltd> you can go lighter than xubuntu
[08:56] <tion> i love the shinny arrow that blinks every time you click :)
[08:56] <ikonia> DrManhattan: very true, it's not a "problem"
[08:56] <majnoon> if do a regular reboot it drops to busybox ,regular reboot uses a modified hybernation mode
[08:56] <ikonia> DrManhattan: however it maybe a problem depending on what you do
[08:56] <DrManhattan> ikonia, if I could get it to go sans GUI - it would run like an absolute monster
[08:56] <ikonia> DrManhattan: it's just something to be aware of
[08:56] <majnoon> need to do a  cold boot
[08:57] <ikonia> DrManhattan: eg: your whole OS will require ram, ram that will not be available to your processing application, balance it and you'll get good performance with your OS being in ram too
[08:57] <majnoon> mvt007geek, no know
[08:57] <DrManhattan> yeah but lets say in theory - I got the OS to load initially with 512MB or less, I'm golden on an office full of modern boxes with 4g of ram or better
[08:57] <ikonia> DrManhattan: then the waste turns into benifit in my opinion on that sort of sizing
[08:58] <majnoon> he want to do thin-client type thing /?
[08:58] <DrManhattan> back in the old days I did that sometimes for gameservers
[08:58] <elfranne> DrManhattan, how about netboot ?
[08:58] <ikonia> DrManhattan: if you can get that level of trade off, I think you'll do well, just remember to write to the ram disk for your processing application too
[08:58] <spyzer> hey everyone, i am running xrdp on ubuntu xfce. But from an RDP client when I try to connect to the machine t says gnome-session not found
[08:58] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I think it would be fantastic and save me a tremendous amount of time on large renders
[08:58] <ikonia> DrManhattan: other wise the USB device will still be your bottleneck
[08:59] <spyzer> i change the .xsession file and wrote xfce4-session
[08:59] <spyzer> int it
[08:59] <DrManhattan> ikonia, yeah, will keep that in mind, but the first run on that would be sick
[08:59] <ikonia> DrManhattan: eg: if your reading and writing your application processing to /processing make sure /processing is held in ram and then you can commit that to physical media after it's done
[08:59] <spyzer> but it still says the same thing
[08:59] <spyzer> please help
[08:59] <spyzer> anybody
[09:00] <aeon-ltd> spyzer: what are you trying to do?
[09:00] <DrManhattan> ikonia, I gotcha, ie /ramdisk/cinelerra/tmp
[09:00] <ikonia> DrManhattan: exactly
[09:00] <DrManhattan> thank you
[09:00] <spyzer> i am trying to rdp to a machine with ubuntu xfce
[09:00] <spyzer> installed
[09:00] <spyzer> aeon-ltd: unable to rdp to a machine with xfce as desktop environment
[09:01] <ikonia> DrManhattan: as long as the ratio for OS/disk storage in ram leave enough ram free for application processing, I think you'll have a great boost
[09:01] <aeon-ltd> spyzer: does it start xfce at boot?
[09:01] <spyzer> yes
[09:01] <corenot> DrManhattan do you really glow blue and can create matter and antimatter
[09:02] <ikonia> corenot: not in here please.
[09:02] <majnoon> ikonia, idea ,maybe 2 usb pens ,1 for os and other for data ??
[09:02] <ikonia> majnoon: please stop, you have no idea what you are saying in relation to DrManhattan's issue
[09:02] <spyzer> aeon-ltd, yes it does boot xfce in the start
[09:03] <DrManhattan> its all about toram
[09:03] <majnoon> usb pen works good on my netbook
[09:04] <ikonia> majnoon: not for DrManhattan's needs
[09:04] <ikonia> majnoon: no-one has said you can't use a usb drive, it is just not suitable for DrManhattan's needs as I said earlier
[09:05] <spyzer> no?

[09:07] <Ronalds_M> can I backup steam game on some other partition?
[09:07] <DrManhattan> Oh my sweet goodness
[09:07] <ikonia> Ronalds_M: steam has a backup function
[09:07] <DrManhattan> I could take red files and mash em down to useable in nothing time with this
[09:07] <DrManhattan> mpeg -2, or 4
[09:07] <ikonia> DrManhattan: excellent.
[09:07] <Ronalds_M> ikonia, but it isn't downloading TF2 another time
[09:08] <aeon-ltd> spyzer: this sounds similar to your situation http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-networking-3/problems-connecting-to-xrdp-xfce-desktop-after-ubuntu-upgrade-943189/
[09:08] <Ronalds_M> after I install other distro?
[09:08] <DrManhattan> hooray for linux - this is why you guys get shout outs on the big bang theory
[09:08] <ikonia> Ronalds_M: then contact steam support
[09:08] <Ronalds_M> it takes a day to download that game
[09:08] <Ronalds_M> again
[09:09] <ikonia> Ronalds_M: you can physically copy the files, however it is doubtful steam will "use them"
[09:09] <ikonia> Ronalds_M: contact steam for the official backup/restore process
[09:09] <Ronalds_M> I doubt it too
[09:09] <Ronalds_M> maybe they have irc for linux version?
[09:09] <ikonia> Ronalds_M: doubtful
[09:10] <Ronalds_M> no they probably don't
[09:10] <Ronalds_M> :D
[09:10] <ikonia> DrManhattan: they have email support
[09:10] <ikonia> DrManhattan: sorry not you
[09:10] <ikonia> Ronalds_M: they have email support
[09:10] <Ronalds_M> I founded backup funtion
[09:10] <Ronalds_M> ok sorry for questions
[09:10] <ikonia> no need to be sorry
[09:10] <ikonia> that's what the channel is here for
[09:11] <frostedfire> hey everyone!
[09:11] <frostedfire> just needed to know a bit abt the new ubuntu mobile os!
[09:11] <ikonia> frostedfire: there is no information
[09:11] <ikonia> frostedfire: beyond what is on the website
[09:12] <frostedfire> is it okay to do app dev on QT creator!
[09:12] <frostedfire> oh!
[09:12] <frostedfire> bt its so vague on the site!
[09:12] <ikonia> frostedfire: contact canonical, as that is the only information they have released.
[09:12] <frostedfire> canonical?
[09:13] <frostedfire> me new to ubuntu!
[09:13] <ikonia> frostedfire: the company that makes it.....
[09:13] <frostedfire> ^_^
[09:13] <frostedfire> oh!
[09:13] <ikonia> frostedfire: I suggest doing some research

[09:13] <frostedfire> k
[09:13] <frostedfire> but where do i begin with?
[09:13] <frostedfire> google i guess!

[09:13] <Ronalds_M> can I write ubuntu 12.10 on 700 mb disk?
[09:14] <Ronalds_M> or it is more now
[09:14] <dr_willis> 12.10 needs a dvd
[09:15] <Ronalds_M> well thats sad
[09:15] <igoryonya> ubuntu 9.10 ext3 mounts read only, can
[09:15] <dr_willis> thats progress...
[09:15] <Ronalds_M> can't wait for next stable relise
[09:15] <igoryonya> 't figure out how to mount normally
[09:16] <Ronalds_M> 12.10 seems fine, but don't like to upgrade it from 12.04
[09:16] <dr_willis> check the output of the mount command to be sure its mounted with the right options
[09:16] <spyzer> aeon-ltd, thanks
[09:17] <Ronalds_M> can phone be used as USB device for installing ubuntu?
[09:17] <iml> no
[09:18] <dr_willis> Ronalds_M:  i would doubt that.
[09:18] <Guest54737> bye ~ ~
[09:18] <frostedfire> a noob talking here so pls excuse me
[09:18] <frostedfire> but is ubuntu that btr than windows?
[09:18] <igoryonya> dr_willis, in fstab there is rw and remount readonly on error, I check it with fsck then remount with rw option, it says, cannot remount rw
[09:18] <corenot> yes it is
[09:19] <frostedfire> i never used it so i don't know!
[09:19] <ikonia> frostedfire: that's personal opinion, you'll need to make your own mind up
[09:19] <ikonia> frostedfire: try it if you want, see if you like it
[09:19] <ikonia> corenot: please......
[09:19] <dr_willis> igoryonya:  hmm.. does dmesg give any messages about it if you unmount it. and try to remount it.
[09:19] <majnoon> frostedfire, depends on what you want to do actually
[09:19] <frostedfire> ikonia am not talking abt the feel psrt of the os
[09:19] <ikonia> frostedfire: I didn't say you where
[09:19] <frostedfire> am talking abt the technical details
[09:20] <frostedfire> lol
[09:20] <ikonia> frostedfire: yes, and it's personal opinion, try it and see if you like it
[09:20] <Ronalds_M> frostedfire, those are not technical at all
[09:20] <shortstraw8> What do I need to do to get my repository to show on local host after I commit and then restart apache, do I have to do anything with /var/www
[09:20] <frostedfire> its that my friend uses ubuntu and he says that its smoother hangs less and stuff like that
[09:21] <frostedfire> thats wat i asked abt
[09:21] <ikonia> frostedfire: it will for some, it won't for others, hence "try it"
[09:21] <frostedfire> oh
[09:21] <frostedfire> k
[09:22] <majnoon> is main reason why the cd/dvd is a live one
[09:23] <ikonia> majnoon: no, ir juar has too much data on it to be a CD
[09:23] <majnoon> is why i put cd/dvd
[09:23] <ikonia> majnoon: but then your question makes no sense
[09:24] <majnoon> meant for him to burn one and try it out
[09:24] <ikonia> "is the reason it's a cd/dvd because it's a livecd", "no" the reason it's a cd/dvd is because it's an easy to distribute media storage device
[09:24] <majnoon> then no need to install first
[09:25] <majnoon> can try out then install if he likes it

[09:30] <pratz> how can I do this in one line  "export NSS_SSL_CBC_RANDOM_IV=0" and "pidgin" ?
[09:30] <pratz> got it
[09:31] <pratz> export NSS_SSL_CBC_RANDOM_IV=0 && pidgin
[09:31] <pratz> correct ?
[09:31] <arunkumar413> how to highlight qml code in gedit
[09:32] <dr_willis> pratz:  or use ;
[09:32] <pratz> dr_willis: that was cool
[09:32] <igoryonya> dr_willis, when I umount /, I also tried umount /dev/sda1, it just goes to the next prompt line, doesn't give any errors, doesn't unmount and dmesg doesn't show any new lines @ the end.
[09:32] <dr_willis> pratz:  actually with system variables you may not need to use export.
[09:33] <dr_willis> igoryonya:  err. i dont think you can unmount /
[09:33] <dr_willis> theres the remount option
[09:34] <goshVerhoben> ahoi
[09:35] <pratz> dr_willis: there is one problem though
[09:35] <pratz> dr_willis: I am putting the command in pidgin launch properties

[09:38] <kewel> I finally got youtube working on this old PIII.  had to install flash 10.3 .. however, the picture is choppy.  should I try older versions of 10.3?  or do I need to consider installing lubuntu?
[09:38] <dr_willis> kewel:  i bet flash is using 10x more resources then lubuntu would. ;)
[09:39] <kewel> dr_willis: really?  I've never tried lubuntu .. is it kewel?
[09:39] <kewel> heh
[09:39] <Kingsy> guys, I am using a ntfs usb stick, the OS mounts the stick automatically but it mounts as read only. If I umount it and attempt to mount manually there is not sdb1 partition only the device (sdb) .. what do I do?
[09:39] <dr_willis> lubuntu works well on my netbooks
[09:40] <kewel> dr_willis: and I will be able to use flash plugin?
[09:40] <arunkumar413> sound in ubuntu sucks
[09:40] <iml> won't make flash play any better on that old cpu
[09:40] <dr_willis> kewel:  flash works for me on 12.10 ;)
[09:40] <kewel> mixxed messages
[09:41] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  the ntfs-config tool can tweak how ntfs-gets mountes

[09:41] <arunkumar413> i have dolby advanced audio on my  laptop but ubuntu plays it like general stereo
[09:41] <andrea__> hello, do you guys know if my CANONSCAN 4400F is supported on ubuntu 12.10 ?
[09:41] <auronandace> kewel: flash will run awfully on that cpu no matter what you use
[09:42] <kewel> ya prolly right.
[09:42] <kewel> it belongs to the house I'm living in
[09:42] <kewel> had windows xp on it and it was fried
[09:43] <kewel> so I got an xp pro disc, and got halfway through install when I found out the serial key was invalid
[09:43] <aeon-ltd> heh
[09:43] <kewel> I'd been wanting to overwrite the ntfs partition with ubuntu
[09:43] <kewel> now I kinda had to heh
[09:44] <kewel> but it's not my puter.  I don't think flash was working in windows.  I just want this puter to surf and openoffice
[09:44] <Kingsy> dr_willis: "enable write support for external device" checkbox is ticked. there is no partitions in the advanced list under it. the OS still mounts as read only.
[09:44] <kewel> oh well
[09:45] <kewel> I'll see if I can't locate a blank cdr.  try out lubuntu.  I'll come tell you how it is.  thanks for bein kewel

[09:45] <igoryonya> dr_willis, when I do mount -o remount,rw /dev/sda1 /, it gives me: ext3_abort called. EXT3-fs error (device sda1): ext3_remount: Abort forced by user mount: cannot remount block device /dev/sda1 read-write, is write-protected
[09:46] <dr_willis> igoryonya:  that is weird.. almost sounds like theres some sort of write protect tab on the device
[09:46] <nytrix> how do i run certain commands automatically when ubuntu boots up?
[09:47] <ActionParsnip> Nytrix: do they need root access?
[09:47] <nytrix> u mean sudo? yes
[09:47] <ActionParsnip> Nytrix: and do they need the desk2

[09:47] <nytrix> desk2? whats that?
[09:48] <ActionParsnip> Nytrix: typo :)
[09:48] <nytrix> yes
[09:48] <dr_willis> nytrix:  depends on what command ;)
[09:48] <nytrix> sudo macchanger -r eth0
[09:48] <nytrix> :)
[09:48] <dr_willis>   that needs to be ran BEFOR login? if so it can to in /etc/rc.local

[09:49] <ademone> my external hard disk it cant be mounted
[09:49] <nytrix> i need to run sudo macchanger -r etho whenever my pc boots up
[09:49] <ademone> i can see it from gparted
[09:49] <geektee> why can't i do "sudo apt-get install ... " 2 applications at the same time. while it is possible in windows ? i was installing a framework. but then i had to install 1mb game in the meanwhile. is it possible ????
[09:49] <igoryonya> dr_willis, already tried, samething
[09:50] <ActionParsnip> Nytrix: the way I do it, is to make a script with a pause of 10 seconds then run the command,  then run the command in /etc/rc.local backgrounded so that the boot continues.  The script will run as root and the pause gives the desktop time to load

[09:50] <nytrix> i dont knw how to make scripts
[09:50] <ActionParsnip> Geektee: because only one application can access the packages at one time

[09:51] <ActionParsnip> Corenot_: hi
[09:51] <geektee> ActionParsnip: don't you think that is a major drawback in ubuntu over windows ??
[09:51] <corenot_> geektee: you can install maybe try putting a space in between them, if dependencies are there then install them first
[09:52] <ActionParsnip> Geektee: its also a thing in Windows,  the Windows installer can only be run once ar a time
[09:52] <dr_willis> nytrix:  if that command is not using a X gui.. it can go in /etc/rc.local
[09:52] <ActionParsnip> Geektee: no, its so that the packages don't get messed up
[09:52] <nytrix> dr, no it is a commad line program and not gui
[09:52] <dr_willis> nytrix:  so.. it can go in rc.local
[09:53] <dr_willis> que up installing 5 things in windows in a row. ;)  apt can do that easially
[09:53] <nytrix> dr, so just add the line sudo macchanger - r eth0 in rc.local?
[09:53] <dr_willis> or 600 things...
[09:53] <dr_willis> nytrix:  no need for sudo in rc.local

[09:54] <ademone> hello
[09:54] <ademone> my external hard disk it cant be mounted

[09:57] <studio> when i go top on the menu there is a help for xface
[09:57] <ActionParsnip> Ademone;: what filesystem does the partition use?
[09:57] <corenot_> Its not xface its xfce
[09:57] <ademone> ntfs
[09:57] <Kingsy> dr_willis: any ideas?
[09:57] <studio> zes sorry
[09:57] <studio> Xfce
[09:58] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  with what?  ive been trying to figure out what xface is.. ;)
[09:58] <Kingsy> lol
[09:58] <corenot_> to my knowledge it works without any problems : xfce
[09:58] <Kingsy> dr_willis: I cant mount my ntfs usb stick with write permissions.
[09:58] <ActionParsnip> Ademone: I suggest you plug it in to a Windows pc, chkdsk the partition, then use the safe remove feature.  Then try it in Ubuntu
[09:58] <Kingsy> and according to the contents of /dev/ it doesnt even have a partition
[09:58] <studio> it Xfce 4.10
[09:58] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  when in doubt fallback to the ntfs-3g command and use whatever options is needed. Or access it as root. ;)
[09:58] <Kingsy> but it must because it mounts automatically as readonly
[09:59] <Kingsy> dr_willis: I did, it said..
[09:59] <corenot_> studio: what about it??
[09:59] <dr_willis> Kingsy:   next time unmount it via the command line.not the gui.  then try remounting it via the command line
[09:59] <ActionParsnip> Kingsy: have you chkdsk'd the partition?
[09:59] <studio> i use simple ubuntu without Windows
[09:59] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  i recall the gui having a unmount, or 'eject' thing. eject turns off the device untillyou replug it back in
[10:00] <ademone> from the windows pc it suggest me to format it
[10:00] <studio> im new with ubuntu is just learning...
[10:00] <nytrix> cool thanks guys. i will try to logout and back in to see
[10:00] <nytrix> :)
[10:00] <Kingsy> dr_willis: yeah it does, I have done that, ejected the device..   it says Failed to mount '/dev/sdb': No medium found       and     ntfs-3g: Failed to access volume '/dev/sdb1': No such file or directory  for sdb1 it obviously doesnt exist
[10:00] <corenot_> studio: good one, xubuntu and kubuntu are equally well but now just stick with one till you become expert
[10:00] <Kingsy> ActionParsnip: no, how do you chkdisk?
[10:01] <SinfulSong> Anyone active here who isn't hardware dumb?
[10:01] <SinfulSong> -_-
[10:01] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  id try plugging it in.. let it auto mount.. check the mount options.. see if root user can read/write to it. that will show its not some weird hardware issue.
[10:01] <ActionParsnip> Kingsy: you'll need Windows for it
[10:01] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  then use the umount command to unmount it.
[10:01] <theadmin> SinfulSong: Well, hardware issues are normally discussed in ##hardware, not here. Unless it's a driver problem or such.
[10:01] <Kingsy> okie dokie..
[10:02] <Kingsy> dr_willis: thanks
[10:02] <SinfulSong> theadmin: thank you
[10:03] <Kingsy> dr_willis: yeah it works under root :D
[10:03] <ActionParsnip> Kingsy: be sure you use the safely remove feature in ALL OSes
[10:04] <Kingsy> I still don't see why it would work under root.. the mountpoint is drwx------ 14 chris chris 4096 Jan 21 10:02 Key      my native user is "chris" and I still cant write to it
[10:04] <shortstraw8> Anyone know the command to load a new file to apache?
[10:05] <Kingsy> it says clearly there, it has rwx for the assigned user
[10:06] <unknown_> hi, i setup dnscrypt-proxy on my desktop but i still can see my real ip address
[10:06] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  /dev/sdk1 on /media/willis/Storage_5 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)
[10:06] <dr_willis> is the options my ntfs disk seems to be using

[10:07] <Kingsy> yep.. I wonder why.. weird
[10:08] <ActionParsnip> Wow people use vfat?
[10:08] <dr_willis> im not sure the dmask/umask options are correct
[10:08] <Kingsy> ActionParsnip: apparently so :S

[10:08] <zgler> :dr_willis   ,   hi, i setup dnscrypt-proxy on my desktop but i still can see my real ip address
[10:08] <dr_willis> zgler:  never heard of  dnscrypt-proxy
[10:08] <zgler> it's from opendns
[10:09] <dr_willis> check their docs/support forurms then perhaps?
[10:09] <zgler> ok, :)
[10:09] <Kingsy> dr_willis: looks like the eject option in the GUI was breaking it somehow, if you umount it the partition is still there..
[10:09] <Kingsy> yipee
[10:09] <szx> do .desktop files support variables? I tried using $HOME and ${HOME} but none of them worked
[10:09] <dr_willis> Kingsy:  eject sort of powers OFF the device.. it wont be seen again by the system untill remove/reinserted
[10:10] <dr_willis> szx:  not that i am aware of.
[10:11] <dr_willis> http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html
[10:11] <dr_willis> theres some built in 'variables'
[10:12] <szx> can't see any variables there
[10:13] <szx> did you mean those % specifiers?
[10:13] <mehdi__> how to creat new user??
[10:14] <fidel> mehdi__: in cli its via 'adduser'
[10:14] <mehdi__> thanks fidel
[10:14] <Keshav> cli?
[10:15] <dr_willis> szx:  those are internal variables. ;)
[10:15] <dr_willis> szx:  you could make the .desktop file launch a bash script that would have full bash features

[10:28] <corenot_> same here bro
[10:32] <mvt007geek> hey guys please help me/. i wrote ubuntu on sd card but pandaboard doesn't boot it.and serial port shows nothing
[10:33] <corenot_> mvt: see if panda arch supports ubuntu
[10:33] <mvt007geek> yes.the architecture is right
[10:33] <k1l_> mvt007geek: we have #ubuntu-arm for arm related questions
[10:34] <mvt007geek> k1l_: it didn't help so much
[10:36] <texla> In ubuntu-12.04.1 Neither gconf-editor or dconf-editor are installed....Which one should be used with this distro.
[10:36] <corenot_> you need to make sd card bootable
[10:36] <vmachine1> hi
[10:38] <ActionParsnip> Texla: dconf
[10:38] <mvt007geek> i have    	 	 	 	 	 	    ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-desktop-armel+omap4.img     too
[10:38] <texla> ActionParsnip, Thanks !!!
[10:38] <ActionParsnip> Mvt007geek: how did you put the data on the SD card?
[10:38] <tomreyn> hi, i remember running into this issue before but i don't remember the solution, and a web search didn't help: i'm using libreoffice  3.6.2.2 on ubuntu 12.10 and when i start libreoffice writer and try to start the letter assistant from the "file" menu, nothing happens at all. no related warning or error message is written to stdout/stderror either
[10:39] <tomreyn> i seem to recall this is somehow related to the java runtime not being properly started / found, but in extras -> options -> libreoffice -> java it does show that my openjdk JRE (1.7.0) is detected.
[10:39] <ActionParsnip> Tomreyn: try renaming ~/.config/libreoffice  then run the application again
[10:40] <ActionParsnip> Tomreyn: java isn't necessary for libreoffice to run
[10:40] <mvt007geek> ActionParsnip:     	 	 	 	 	 	    dd if=ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-desktop-armel+omap4.img of=/dev/sdb
[10:40] <mvt007geek> corenot_: how should i make it bootable?
[10:40] <army_man> Keshav:  hi are you from India?
[10:40] <ActionParsnip> Mvt007geek: did you MD5 test the file?
[10:41] <mvt007geek> corenot_: even serialport shows me nothing.
[10:41] <tomreyn> ActionParsnip: not for libreoffice itself, but for the assistants, isn't it?
[10:41] <tomreyn> at least that's how it used to be in openoffice times
[10:41] <mvt007geek> ActionParsnip: when i downloaded ubuntu i did checksum on file
[10:42] <tomreyn> ActionParsnip: unfortunately renaming  ~/.config/libreoffice didn't help
[10:42] <ActionParsnip> Tomreyn: not sure. Could try without to see if it affects your use
[10:43] <ActionParsnip> Mvt007geek: http://elinux.org/BeagleBoardUbuntu may help
[10:44] <tomreyn> ActionParsnip: turns out i was missing some packages.

[10:44] <hXm> hello i have a ubuntu server and i modified /var/www in this way: sudo chown root:www /var/www/ -R
[10:44] <hXm> and added my user to www group
[10:44] <hXm> but i cant enter in some directories
[10:44] <mvt007geek> texla: whaat should i do now? i should download them?
[10:45] <Keshav> I have an Mtnl Data card, installed its .deb file after copying it on desktop, now this data card has a habit of disconnecting every 1 hour or so, moreover the system does not recognise the card after it disconnects. I have also tried removing the dongle from the USB but still it won't get detected
[10:46] <ActionParsnip> Hxm: are the folders executable to the group?
[10:46] <Keshav> AS a result I have to restart the system after every 1 hour with ubuntu, however for Windows the setup file detects the dongle and hence saves up time
[10:46] <Keshav> Any solution for this?
[10:46] <Keshav> workaround?
[10:47] <hXm> ActionParsnip: i just see this when i execute ls -la d????????? ? ? ? ?            ? .

[10:47] <hXm> and before that alot of permission denied
[10:47] <ActionParsnip> Keshav: unload and reload the driver module, should jump it to life. Are there bugs reported?
[10:48] <ActionParsnip> Hxm: probably the issue then
[10:49] <Keshav> How to check that :o Am a newbie so if you could guide or link to some page?
[10:49] <corenot_> mvt007geek: use unetbootin to create a bootable disk

[10:54] <hXm> i see them with root, dr_willis
[10:54] <dr_willis> Huh?  You see differnt permissions as root. and as a user?
[10:54] <dr_willis> or  You mean they are correct as root.

[10:55] <jirido> vHi there comrades.. do anyone know if vfat really needs noatime in fstab. isn't it so that fat32 dont have owner or permissions so why access stamps??

[10:57] <ikonia> it's not
[10:58] <dr_willis> allow_utime=value This option controls the permission check of mtime/atime.
[10:58] <jirido> dr_willis, i didn see it was specified
[11:03] <jirido> Is the defaults different for different filesystems or is it the same / ah so if i put allow_utime it will notice that vfat dont use atime and drop the checkings?

[12:51] <mathi> hi
[12:51] <mathi> i have a problem while mounting my external usb hard drive to the cdrom
[12:51] <mathi> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1550317
[12:52] <mathi> this works:  mount –t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
[12:52] <mathi> but the next step doesn't:   mount –t iso9660 –o loop /mnt/usb/ubuntu-12.10-server-amd64.iso /mnt/iso
[12:52] <mathi> it says no such fil or directory
[12:52] <mathi> indeed there is no iso file in /mnt/usb
[12:54] <LigH> Greetings. Running Ubuntu 12.04; usbview cannot list devices, usbdevfs is probably not installed, /proc/bus/ only contains input/ and pci/. Could not yet find any forum thread about how to install usbdevfs, only a "SOLVED" thread about the same issue without further details (issue may be deprecated).
[12:55] <LigH> mathi: To mount a disk to a directory, this directory has to be created first and must be empty. (mkdir)
[12:55] <mathi> LighH this has been done
[12:55] <mathi> in /mnt I have a dir usb and a dir iso
[12:55] <mathi> LigH, ^
[12:55] <LigH> Oh, sorry...
[12:56] <LigH> And you should have the ubuntu*.iso file on your mounted harddisk?
[12:56] <mathi> LigH you mean in /mnt/usb ?
[12:57] <LigH> Yes. You will have copied this image to this location when you want to mount it from there.
[12:58] <mathi> LigH I have a bunch of file in /mnt/usb (after having done "mount –t vfat /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb") but I don't see any iso file
[12:58] <dr_willis> mathi:  you made the directory /mnt/iso ?
[12:58] <mathi> dr_willis, yes
[12:59] <LigH> You can only mount an iso image which exists on the media where you want to mount it from.
[12:59] <dr_willis> you could be getting thepath to the iso wrong also
[12:59] <mathi> dr_willis, I don't have any iso file
[12:59] <dr_willis>  Your example shows an iso file
[12:59] <mathi> dr_willis, this is what I type and it doesn't work because there is no iso file
[13:00] <LigH> If you want to mount an ISO image from your USB stick, first copy that ISO file onto your USB stick.
[13:00] <mathi> I am folowing a tutorial
[13:00] <dr_willis> so you have a flash drive...  and it has an iso file on it?
[13:00] <mathi> I have Ubuntu Server image on an external hard drive
[13:00] <mathi> it is not an iso
[13:00] <mathi> it is the image with all the files
[13:00] <dr_willis> mathi:  what sort of 'image' is it exactly? where did it come from
[13:00] <mathi> from USB Universal Installer
[13:00] <LigH> An ISO image is a CD/DVD image, usually of an installation disc.
[13:01] <dr_willis> mathi:  you mean  you used the universial installer to 'create' a bootable flash drive from an iso file/cd?
[13:01] <mathi> dr_willis, exactly
[13:01] <iceroot> mathi: an sio is an image and you are looking at the content from the iso and not the iso file itsefl
[13:01] <mathi> because I have a mini-PC without CD reader
[13:01] <dr_willis> mathi:  so you mount the USB same as you would any other hard drive
[13:01] <LigH> If you created a bootable stick, boot your PC from this stick instead of from your harddisk.
[13:02] <mathi> dr_willis, I am new to Linux, I am Windows user
[13:02] <dr_willis>  that example you gave is implying you have the actual ISO file on the usb. not a live cd setup on the flash
[13:02] <HiddenCloud> join the club
[13:02] <mathi> LigH, this works already, but unfortnately the Ubuntu Server Instalation gives error that it tries to mount from CD-ROM
[13:02] <dr_willis> mathi:  wny not start from the beginning and tell the channel what you are trying to do.

[13:02] <mathi> dr_willis, sorry
[13:03] <dr_willis> 10.10 ? why are you using 10.10? its over 2 yrs old
[13:03] <dr_willis> !10.10
[13:03] <ubottu> Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) was the thirteenth release of Ubuntu. !End-Of-Life on April 10th, 2012, see http://ubottu.com/y/maverick for details.
[13:03] <dr_willis> and its EOL.
[13:03] <mathi> dr_willis, can you tell me what I should do ? I've been busy with it since morning :(
[13:03] <mathi> dr_willis, I use 12.10
[13:03] <dr_willis> server installs have some known issues when put on a USB. theres some fixs out there.. but ive never really needed them
[13:03] <mathi> but the tutorial is about 10.10
[13:04] <dr_willis> mathi:  WHY are you using a server install?
[13:04] <dr_willis> that 10.10 guide may be totally wrong for 12.10
[13:04] <mathi> dr_willis, because I don't need an interface
[13:04] <dr_willis> you can turn off the desktop on a desktop install.
[13:04] <mathi> dr_willis, I want to use this computer as a server, so it makes sense to isntall Ubuntu Server ?
[13:05] <Ben64> mathi: if you already have ubuntu on there, why not keep it and install whatever server stuff you want?
[13:05] <dr_willis> mathi:  I use desktop installs for all my server needs..
[13:05] <dr_willis> but im just a home user.
[13:06] <dr_willis> and Yes you MAY need a interface ---> mathi    | dr_willis, I am new to Linux, I am Windows user
[13:06] <Ben64> my server has ubuntu server on it, but its a real server many many miles from me
[13:06] <dr_willis> mathi:  so why are you not just booting the 12.10 USB you made?
[13:07] <mvt007geek> arae
[13:08] <mathi> dr_willis, I booted on the USB, and that worked great, had to choose the langauge, timezone, ... but THEN it tries to "detect and mount CD-ROM" and I want to put the Ubuntu Server image from my USB on /cdrom (or something like that) and there I fail
[13:08] <LigH> It may depend on the definition of the term "server"... ;) -- Is it "a PC you never log into", or simply "a PC which runs all the daemons (services) I need to access what I want"?
[13:08] <dr_willis> mathi:  thats a known error thats fixable...
[13:08] <mathi> Ben64, I don't have Ubuntu there, I have no OS
[13:08] <mathi> dr_willis, how ?
[13:08] <dr_willis> http://askubuntu.com/questions/127398/usb-drive-install-of-ubuntu-12-04-server-fails-cant-find-components-from-cd-r
[13:08] <dr_willis> that guide mentions how to fix it.
[13:09] <dr_willis> I thought it had been fixed in 12.10 - but some usb tools stillmake the mistakes i guess
[13:09] <dr_willis> some tools at the pendrivelinux site may make the USB properly.
[13:10] <dr_willis> Inever use the server install. so cant really suggest any tools

[13:11] <PatrickDickey> Question for everyone. Is it possible that kernel panics due to bad memory won't show up until you reinstall with the bad memory in the computer? I upgraded my memory without any kernel panics, but after I did a clean install, I started getting them.
=== cryptfu_ is now known as Guest72142
[13:12] <Bizzeh> PatrickDickey: they will show under high ram load. run memtest
[13:12] <dr_willis> PatrickDickey:  try the memtest tool. and perhaps clean/reseat the ram
[13:12] <PatrickDickey> I did. It had well over 10,000 errors.
[13:12] <dr_willis> ive had memory slots go bad befor also
[13:12] <mathi> dr_willis, I will try, need some minutes
[13:12] <dr_willis> thats not a good sign.
[13:13] <PatrickDickey> Yeah. Brand new memory too. :S
[13:13] <dr_willis> mathi:  if you are totally new to Linux/Ubuntu - i suggest using the desktop install so you can get comfortable with it
[13:13] <folorn> dont suppose anyone has time to help me with a small problem- "im trying to download skype for ubuntu newest release but dont know how to go about doing it.
[13:13] <Bizzeh> PatrickDickey: is it a cheapo brand or unbranded like kingston? i have had 1 in 3 sticks i have bought that are cheap, not work. never had a single corsair stick not work
[13:13] <Ben64> PatrickDickey: you should check/fix ram timing in the bios

[13:14] <PatrickDickey> Crucial Ballistix Memory.
[13:14] <Bizzeh> hmmn, try what ben64 said, if that doesnt work, i would send it back for a replacement, could be bad sticks

[13:15] <Ben64> i have a couple sticks that gave incorrect info, and caused memory errors
[13:15] <Bizzeh> PatrickDickey: there should be a "load optimised defaults" or something like that, try that, and set your bios back up as you like it
[13:15] <PatrickDickey> I checked crucial's site, and the memory I have is "guaranteed compatible" with my board.
[13:15] <Ben64> should be able to set timings manually
[13:16] <Bizzeh> Ben64: but if he doesnt know what timings to set, or even what timings are...
[13:16] <aguitel> how install libreoffice in 10.04 ? i am add ppa but it say :Package libreoffice has no installation candidate
[13:16] <Ben64> they're listed on the ram, or in the documentation of them, or online about them
[13:16] <Ben64> aguitel: upgrade to 12.04

[13:50] <fas> mathi_: what's it saying when it gives you that error?
[13:50] <BluesKaj> Russian, have your tried nvidia-current driver ?
[13:50] <fas> yeah, apt-get
[13:50] <fidel> mathi_: apt-cache policy apt-get
[13:50] <Russian> yes and it screws with the whole system
[13:50] <mathi_> apt-get works
[13:50] <speakman> mathi_: I guess APT couldn't connect to the mirror. Try another mirror.
[13:50] <Ben64> nvidia-current doesn't work on a 6200
[13:50] <Ben64> he needs an older version
[13:50] <Russian> i've tried purging and nvidia-current
[13:50] <mathi_> what is the difference apt and apt-get ?
[13:50] <Ben64> nvidia-173 - NVIDIA binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library
[13:50] <Ben64> mathi_: apt doesn't exist
[13:51] <Russian> my system for what ever reason doesn't play well with nvidia
[13:51] <fidel> mathi_: what is the output of: which apt-get
[13:51]  * BluesKaj nvidia-current supports the 6series
[13:51] <mistere> fas: i need the full xen for virtultion systm
[13:51] <speakman> Ben64: Should I try nvidia-173 on my GeForce 210?
[13:51] <Russian> tweak tool doesn't help either
[13:51] <BluesKaj> but obviously that's not the case
[13:51] <Ben64> speakman: no, yours is newer
[13:52] <hkn_> What is the best text editor for Ubuntu. For C++ JAVA PHP etc etc ?
[13:52] <ioria> Russian: i think you have to rebuild the drivers
[13:52] <fidel> hkn_: there is in general no best
[13:52] <Russian> nvidia-current for some reason makes my system buggy, as well as when I reboot, it shows ubuntuGNOME in a blue screen before a full boot
[13:52] <fidel> !poll hkn_
[13:52] <tempspace> hkn_, that's very subjective...I prefer Sublime Text 2
[13:52] <BluesKaj> Russian, have you consulted the nvidia site for driver match ?
[13:52] <fidel> !poll > hkn_
[13:52] <ubottu> hkn_, please see my private message

[13:54] <Ben64> Russian: well you need nvidia drivers, apparently i was wrong, nvidia-current does work
[13:54] <Russian> !ubottu!BluesKaj
[13:54] <Ben64> Russian: and you can use nvidia-settings to change resolution
[13:54] <aleale97> Hi all

[14:00] <Ben64> mathi_: i thought you didn't want a gui
[14:00] <hkn_> How do i make " Sublime Text 2 " default editor for somefiles ?
[14:00] <BluesKaj> Russian, you to install mesa-utils for this command to work , but to make sure you're actually using the nvidia driver you installed , run thasi in the terminal ,  glxinfo | grep OpenGL
[14:00] <iceroot> Guest87940: gparted is the recommed way on formating something
[14:00] <iceroot> !gparted | Guest87940
[14:00] <ubottu> Guest87940: gparted is a !GTK/!Gnome !GUI partitioning program. Type « sudo apt-get install gparted » in a console to install it - A GParted "live" CD is available at http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
[14:01] <Guest87940> ok i will install it and try....is that all?
[14:01] <Russian> i'll try

[14:01] <mathi_> Ben64, I cannot use teamviewer without GUI ?
[14:01] <iceroot> Guest87940: its a very nice tool
[14:01] <hkn_> how do i make a text editor as default ?
[14:01] <Forcevision> Hi !
[14:01] <Russian> !BlueKaj i tried run thasi and nothing
[14:01] <ubottu> Russian: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[14:01] <Forcevision> I have a problem with my vsftpd. I get this error message libgcc_s.so.1 must be installed for pthread_cancel to work then I try to connect to my ftp-server. What is the problem ?
[14:01] <Ben64> mathi_: teamviewer shares a desktop, how will you share a desktop if you don't have a desktop?
[14:02] <mathi_> Ben64, I want to share my console :)
[14:02] <Guest87940> ok i will try it and get back to u iceroot
[14:02] <Ben64> mathi_: i told you how. putty and ssh
[14:02] <fidel> mathi_: you dont share a console via teamviewer
[14:02] <iceroot> mathi_: use ssh + screen
[14:02] <mathi_> Ben64, ok I go for Putty then :)
[14:02] <hkn_> How do i set text editor as default editor??
[14:02] <fidel> !repeat | hkn_
[14:02] <ubottu> hkn_: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[14:02] <mathi_> Ben64, how can I configure SSH on my Ubuntu Server ?
[14:03] <fas> hkn_: what do you mean?
[14:03] <fas> mathi_: check out the documentation
[14:03] <Russian> <BlueKaj> I tried that as well and it didn't do anything fo rme
[14:03] <Ben64> !ssh | mathi_
[14:03] <ubottu> mathi_: SSH is the Secure SHell protocol, see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH for client usage. PuTTY is an SSH client for Windows; see: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ for it's homepage. See also !scp (Secure CoPy) and !sshd (Secure SHell Daemon)
[14:03] <fas> it's easy
[14:03] <mathi_> thank you!!!!
[14:03] <iceroot> !screen | mathi_
[14:03] <ubottu> mathi_: screen is a window manager for terminal sessions, also useful over SSH. The 'byobu' package provides very useful additional utilities. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Screen
[14:03] <hkn_> fas when i click double on a txt or php file i want to let it open a editor. Like in windows you could choise in maps. How is it in Ubuntu ?
[14:04] <iceroot> mathi_: with screen you can share the console, more then one can conntect to the terminal session, all people can type or only one can type and so on
[14:04] <fas> Are you using Unity?
[14:04] <Ben64> hkn_: right click
[14:04] <BluesKaj> Russian, pastebin the output ..it's not supposed to fix anything , just tells which driver is in use

[14:11] <ioria> Russian: go- not  do - to http://paste.ubuntu.com/
[14:11] <fas> hkn_: I assume you just downloaded it then... you didn't 'install' it
[14:11] <Ben64> Russian: open a terminal, type "glxinfo | grep OpenGL | pastebinit"
[14:11] <Russian> I have to make a new account
[14:11] <haeihaeihaei> hkn_: Then you can use the "Use custom command" window.
[14:11] <hkn_> Ben64, that what you told Sumblime TExt 2
[14:11] <ioria> Russian: do as Ben64 says
[14:12] <Ben64> hkn_: what?
[14:12] <hkn_> haeihaeihaei,  i dont understand that
[14:12] <fas> mathi_: sorry, I have no clue, did you google that message?
[14:12] <Russian> its says  OpenGL extensions:
[14:12] <hkn_> Ben64,  that's the editor Sublime TExt 2
[14:12] <haeihaeihaei> hkn_: What editor are you trying to use ?
[14:12] <Ben64> Russian: i don't think you typed that in correctly
[14:12] <fas> hkn_: there's probably an option that says "Use other command" right?
[14:12] <Ben64> fas: not anymore
[14:12] <ioria> Russian: you have to give us an url
[14:13] <Ben64> hkn_: how did you install it

[14:13] <Ben64> hkn_: fas: well obviously that isn't going to work
[14:14] <Ben64> and is definitely not supported in #ubuntu
[14:14] <fas> hkn_: you'll need to add it to your path most likely
[14:14] <Ben64> that won't do it

[14:17] <haeihaeihaei> Hello bentinata
[14:18] <Russian> Ben64: should I run that code
[14:18] <Touhou11> I'd be cautious using Sublime Text - it's not Open Source like most editors, suggest monitoring it with Wireshark if you intend to use it

[14:26] <Space_Man2> thanks Ben64 and Touhou11, I guess I should updtae to someting a bit newer :P
[14:26] <Russian> Ben64: my problems arise after rebooting every time lol
[14:26] <Touhou11> Ontherocks: This is why you shouldn't use an obscure distribution unless your competent enough to fix problems yourself
[14:26] <Guest78516> i want to get to ubuntu lucid but now i have ubuntu  11
[14:27] <Russian> we shall see
[14:27] <ikonia> !lucid | Guest78516
[14:27] <ubottu> Guest78516: Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) was the twelfth release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004 - Supported until April 2013 (Desktop), April 2015 (Server)
[14:27] <Guest78516> is that possible to get it without deleting everything
[14:27] <Ben64> you want to go backwards?
[14:27] <alami> BluesKaj:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Caicos [Radeon HD 7400 Series]
[14:27] <Russian> Ben64: thank you for the help. Much appreciated
[14:28] <fidel> Guest78516: you have 11.xy - lucid was 10.04. Sure you arent looking for 12.04 or 12.10?
[14:28] <Guest78516> so i have to format again??
[14:28] <fidel> Guest78516: no you can upgrade from 11.xx to 12.xx
[14:28] <ikonia> Guest78516: you cannot downgrade though
[14:28] <alami> BluesKaj: i have ubuntu 12.10
[14:28] <fidel> you just should start be checking what version you really have ;)
[14:29] <Guest78516> no i i want lucid  its better than this thing
[14:29] <Guest78516> my machine is not stable here
[14:29] <fidel> Guest78516: see ikonias comment then
[14:29] <ikonia> Guest78516: ok, you'll need to re-install then, using lucid
[14:29] <Ben64> Guest78516: try 12.04. support for 10.04 ends in a couple months
[14:29] <BluesKaj> Ben64, thanks for helping Russian , my znc bouncer dropped my connection while we were trying to determine his driver , so i missed his pastebin url
[14:30] <Ben64> BluesKaj: yeah, hopefully it works
[14:30] <alami> BluesKaj:01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Caicos [Radeon HD 7400 Series]
[14:30] <p1l0t> I just wiped Win7 and installed Ubuntu on a new 8-core Acer. It's working great but every other time I have installed Ubuntu what I chose for a computer name shows up user@computername. Instead I am seeing user@Ubuntu. Of course it says unable to resolve hostname when you sudo. etc/hosts says 127.0.1.1 hostname
[14:30] <ikonia> BluesKaj: 10.04 is around for 5 years
[14:30] <Ben64> BluesKaj: if everything went to plan, he got his linux headers, and the nvidia driver built correctly
[14:30] <ikonia> p1l0t: are you sure you are not booting from remote media
[14:30] <Guest78516> its sad ..thx again for you help
[14:30] <BluesKaj> Ben64, right
[14:31] <adamk> alami: Did you run 'LIBGL_DEBUG=verbose matlab' like the error says?
[14:31] <alami> can any one help me to fix my graphic card Problem?
[14:31] <iceroot> ikonia: 10.04 has 3 years support (desktop) and 5 years (server). 12.04 was the first release with 5 years for the desktop
[14:31] <p1l0t> ikonia This is installed on the harddrive but I did do a wubi instead of wiping the whole harddrive like I usually do
[14:31] <ikonia> p1l0t: why would you do wubi if you've removed windows 7 ?
[14:31] <ikonia> iceroot: ah, thank you
[14:32] <BluesKaj> alami, have you tried the "additional drivers" yet
[14:32] <Guest78516> im going to wubi lucid then
[14:32] <iceroot> ikonia: as always, you are welcome .)
[14:32] <Guest78516> bye
[14:32] <alami> http://pastebin.com/MT9cvXcr
[14:32] <p1l0t> ikonia: Actually I lied I think it's a dual-boot I usually just wipe it is what I meant
[14:32] <iKrzysiek> hello
[14:32] <mathi_> Ben64, I typed it all on pastebin: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=JJvznp1T

[14:32] <alami> adamk:http://pastebin.com/MT9cvXcr
[14:33] <p1l0t> ikonia: I don't use the windows for anything I should probably just wipe it but no I have been using this for a few months
[14:33] <iKrzysiek> someone know lirc?
[14:33] <iKrzysiek> I cant find /etc/init/eventlicd.conf
[14:33] <alami> i try to instal now additional drivers and i will see if that work
=== mh0 is now known as Guest92919
[14:36] <mathi_> Ben64, any idea?
[14:38] <p1l0t> ikonia: If I wipe the harddrive and do a fresh install will that solve the problem though? Or is that extreme for something that should be a simple fix? My etc/hosts file says 127.0.1.1 hostname I don't know why it says user@ubuntu
[14:40] <ikonia> p1l0t: I have no idea, as I don't know your wubi setup, but a clean install will not be a problem as you describe
[14:41] <p1l0t> ikonia: OK I will just wipe it and reinstall then I don't need microsht anyway on here
[14:41] <ikonia> p1l0t: there is no need for that language or name calling
[14:41] <ikonia> p1l0t: it makes you look foolish rather than "cool"
[14:41] <p1l0t> microsoft I meant
[14:41] <p1l0t> typo
[14:41] <ikonia> no it wasn't
[14:41] <alami> thanks it work now
[14:42] <FlowRiser> ikonia, i always mispell micro$$oft
[14:42] <ikonia> please stop FlowRiser
[14:42] <ikonia> there is no need for it, the company is called microsoft.
[14:42] <FlowRiser> ikonia, i know, i'm just messing with you :P
[14:45] <abdul> how do i log in as root in ubuntu
[14:45] <p1l0t> Shouldn't Microsoft also have a capital M as it is a proper noun? ;)
[14:45] <abdul> or does it have a default passwd
=== abdul is now known as Guest46108
[14:45] <usr13> I think what these guys are saying is that this channel is not for slandering or making fun of anyone or any company, it is for Ubuntu support. p1l0t Yes, you are correct.
[14:45] <Guest46108> i did su - and it requested for password which i did provide but it said authentication failed
[14:45] <Guest46108> help
[14:46] <mpajor_op5> Guest46108: login as your user you created during the installation and then type su root and your passwod to your account
[14:46] <iceroot> !sudo | Guest46108
[14:46] <ubottu> Guest46108: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[14:46] <p1l0t> It was immature of me, I'm only thirty but I act like I'm 12 sometimes
[14:46] <soahccc> Is it possible to change the directory when using "su someuser -lm"? When omitting -m it will change to someuser's $HOME of coure. When passing it via -c it doesn't stay su'ed
[14:46] <usr13> Guest46108: Try sudo
[14:46] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: please dont suggest that here
[14:46] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: also its wrong what you are saying
[14:46] <mpajor_op5> sudo su root then, fine, you got me!
[14:47] <iceroot> Guest46108: su - is asking for the root-password, but there is no root-account enabled by default on ubuntu. on ubuntu we are using sudo instead of a root shell
[14:47] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: even more stupid
[14:47] <usr13> Guest46108: It's best to operate Ubuntu as it is.  If you open up the root account, you are asking for touble.
[14:48] <soahccc> mpajor_op5: If you want to do this you should use "sudo -i" I think. But you don't want to in most cases I think.
[14:48] <mpajor_op5> thanks but my way works for me
[14:48] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: and its still stupid and will set the env wrong
[14:49] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: sudo su is always the wrong way
[14:49] <mpajor_op5> sure is iceroot, thanks for the heads up
[14:49] <usr13> mpajor_op5: It is just as easy to use Ubuntu as you are supposed to do and you will avoid problems as well.
[14:49] <FlowRiser> usr13, i agree
[14:50] <mpajor_op5> I have no problems doing the way I do it hehe
[14:50] <usr13> mpajor_op5: Just FYI...
[14:50] <FlowRiser> mpajor_op5, i sometimes do that too  :P i get bored of typing sudo every line
[14:50] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: you can do what you want with your system but dont suggest something like that here please
[14:51] <soahccc> Btw: Is this channel about ubuntu in general or either desktop or server version? There is no topic afais (as far as I can see, isn't a legit internet contraction I suppose)
[14:51] <iceroot> use sudo -i, sudo bash -l or something like that but not sudo su
=== seednode_afk is now known as seednode
[14:51] <haeihaeihaei> soahccc: I believe it is used for both editions.
[14:52] <mpajor_op5> FlowRiser: honestly I never logon as root, I very rarely do so, but when I really do (and it has been a while ago) I always use sudo su :-)
[14:52] <soahccc> FlowRiser: Nevertheless you should prefer "sudo -i" over "sudo su".
[14:53] <haeihaeihaei> Or you can just use NOPASSWD in the sudo file :) As secure as sudo su any day ;-)
[14:53] <iceroot> haeihaeihaei: sudo su has nothing to do with less secure then sudo -i
[14:54] <mpajor_op5> iceroot: fine, as you please. In respond to your request I'd kindly ask you to answer new user in a more simpler manner than forwarding them to a 2-page documentation that can be answered with a 5 letter wording :)
[14:54] <haeihaeihaei> Was trying to make I joke, apparently I failed :(
[14:54] <iceroot> and just for the info, sudo su is wrong because you are calling su as root, because sudo already gave you root access and that will result in a wrong environment
[14:54] <mpajor_op5> although, I do appreciate your cautioness with "root"-related questions. Being root is evil :)
[14:54] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: using sudo su is evil
[14:55] <iceroot> mpajor_op5: its wrong
[14:55] <Russian_> Ben64: you sill online?
[14:56] <mpajor_op5> I *get* it. I *very rarely* do it but when I "have to" I do it that way. Thank you for the wake-up-call, It's a damage I have from Debian, I never do that in centos/redhat though, don't ask me why :)
[14:56] <Russian_> Ben64: as your solution worked, but now after login, my system freezes after awhile or a few mouse clicks
[14:56] <voodootru> hi Guys, just wondering what the status of the Ubuntu phone thing is? Is there currently a way to install it on a phone with HDMI out and use it as a PC?

[14:57] <djzn> sorry
[14:58] <Russian_> Ben64: also everything is now running slow and buggy
[14:58] <voodootru> thanks for the quick responses haeihaeihaei , somsip
[14:59] <Russian_> Has anyone here had any here had any problems with nvidia and a slow buggy response after the updates and reboot as well as the OS freezing?
[14:59] <Russian_> after nvidia update to current
[15:00] <Russian_> my resolution is fixed but now have slow and crappy response
[15:00] <Bino1710> does anyone know how i can change the log in screen in 12.04 , I'm running Pinguy OS?
[15:00] <lotuspsychje> anyone knows how those goo.gl emails bypass ubuntu's security on hotmail?
[15:01] <OerHeks> Russian_, what nvidia card do you have?  lspci | grep VGA
[15:01] <fidel> Bino1710: login screen depends in the first moment on the loginmanager. are you using lightdm or gdm or something else?
[15:02] <fidel> Bino1710: pinguy is most likely not supported inhere - as the channel is focusing on plain ubuntu
[15:02] <lotuspsychje> !pinguy
[15:02] <Russian_> OerHeks:NVIDIA Corporation NV44 [GeForce 6200SE TurboCache (TM)] (rev a1)
[15:03] <Bino1710> i think i might be using gdm , not really sure. I know for a fact that its not lightdm though. how can I tell ?
[15:03] <soahccc> What is the recommended way of sudoing into another user? I tried "sudo -u www-data -i" which asks me for my password while having a NOPASSWD: ALL (weren't we talking about that recently? xD)
[15:03] <fidel> Bino1710: sudp dpkg-reconfigure gdm (should show you the currently selected option)
[15:03] <haeihaeihaei> soahccc: www-data usally is a system user.
[15:04] <fidel> and offer you the option to change it

[15:04] <Bino1710> yeah , I know but i figured that since it was based on Ubuntu 12.04 then the process is probably not that different
[15:05] <soahccc> lotuspsychje: Does that apply when loggin in via key?
[15:06] <sahota> hi all
[15:06] <lotuspsychje> soahccc:i use it to sudo actions from another user: like sux username firefox
[15:06] <OerHeks> Russian_, i think you need the  legacy nvidia 173.14.X for that older card
[15:06] <lotuspsychje> soahccc: or sux username bash
[15:06] <soahccc> lotuspsychje: I actually want to stay as that user
[15:07] <lotuspsychje> soahccc:not sure on that1
[15:08] <soahccc> Well actually actually I want an alias to switch to www-data while keeping my env (aliases, psy) and, optimally changing into a specific directory
[15:09] <soahccc> I currently use    alias as_www='sudo su www-data -lm'

[15:21] <kunji> Hey everyone... what is every possible thing that could blank my screen on a standard 12.10 install?  The issue is described here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12466246#post12466246  I can' t figure it out and it's driving me crazy.
[15:22] <kunji> Also does turning off the screen saver via "xset s off" survive a reboot?
[15:22] <jrib> kunji: pastebin output of « xset q »
[15:22] <jrib> kunji: no
[15:22] <haeihaeihaei> MrSmurfing: Ok, almost sounded like a DNS error.
[15:22] <kunji> jrib: Ah if that doesn't survive a reboot, it could be the problem
[15:23] <kunji> jrib: Yeah it says prefer blanking: yes and timeout is 600, so... do you know how I set turn that off persistently?
[15:23] <jrib> kunji: I would be surprised if that isn't exposed in the gui somewhere, though don't ask me where
[15:23] <MrSmurfing> haeihaeihaei: I also tried using googles DNS 8.8.8.8 - sources.list is original untouched from install.
[15:24] <jrib> kunji: if you don't want to find it in the gui, put it in startup applications (or ~/.xprofile or ~/.xsessionrc)
[15:24] <mutes> how would i go about adding things to install during the automated ubuntu installation?
[15:24] <kunji> jrib: Many people seem to have trouble finding it in the GUI, I don't believe it's there, screen saver settings have not been there for at least 2 releases
[15:24] <haeihaeihaei> MrSmurfing: And is this error during apt-get update or upgrade?
[15:25] <MrSmurfing> haeihaeihaei: apt-get update. apt-get upgrade doesn't give any errors, but also does 0 updates.

[15:37] <jorin91> Hello i hope someone can help me. ive got a desktop pc with ubuntu studio 12.04, after some updates my internet doesnt work anymore, nof calbe and no wifi. My intergrated network card is installed properly and also my wifi adapter. Beside that there is a connection between router and pc, i can see that on the lights of my router. The weird thing is, at connecting it stays looping to connect, with wifi it also asks me the password ag
[15:38] <j0g> nslookup
[15:38] <haeihaeihaei> jorin91: Youre sure it's the right password for the wifi ?
[15:39] <wynn> jrib: I have the following repos: main, universe, restricted, multiverse (is this useful?), and Independent (Other software tab... is this useful?)
[15:39] <jorin91> yes my laptop connects the same point and same pass, it has windows 8. my desktop has no dual boot. besides the pass of wifi its still weird that cable also doesnt work. it has worked before
[15:39] <wynn> jrib: I have 3 keys, all from ubuntu
[15:39] <jrib> wynn: what do you mean by "useful"?

[15:57] <jrib> e-dard: backports, ppa, rebuild the source package yourself (making sure the dependencies are satisfied on 11.10), upgrade to 12.04.  Why not upgrade to 12.04?
=== MartinS is now known as Guest39692
[15:58] <henk_> ubottu: Already
[15:58] <ubottu> If you install a development version of Ubuntu Quantal and keep up with package updates, then you will be upgraded to the official release of 12.10 when it comes out. To make sure, type « sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade » in a terminal.
[15:58] <jrib> kunji: you can just create it.  I don't know which is preferred
[15:58] <mathi> jrib, during installation there was a problem when installing APT, it was "scanning mirror" and always leaving at this stage, seems like the mirror site was not accessible ... so i didn't have apt fully installed and all basic applciations I didn't have :(

[15:59] <jrib> mathi: do a successful install
[15:59] <mathi> jrib, but it's a ubuntu server problem it seems ... I had the internet, I checked by pinging some websites
[16:00] <e-dard> jrib: to be frank. It's a production server and I'm too worried about breaking someone else's shit
[16:00] <mathi> jrib, if I reinstall I will ahve the same error
[16:01] <cave2596> I have installed Ubuntu 12.10 an used it successfull. But now it doesn't load at the start screen.
[16:01] <wynn> jrib: OK. I created the .gnupg dir and it created the keyring. It is updating without the message now. Thanks!
[16:01] <cave2596> Does anyone know this problem?
[16:01] <jrib> e-dard: well 11.10 will lose support in april anyway, so I would just plan and do the upgrade to 12.04
[16:02] <e-dard> jrib: yeah I guess. I will try and use back ports for now
[16:02] <jrib> wynn: ok, cool.  Weird that it did that

=== f is now known as Guest84203
[16:37] <Guest84203> bye
[16:37] <jrib> kunji: one way is for you to use the equivalent of a system-wide .xsessionrc which you can take to be /etc/X11/Xsession.options I believe.  You could also create a file in /etc/X11/Xsession.d (grep -i xsession /etc/X11/Xsession for details).  The "best" way, I don't know.  I don't know if there is a system-wide .xprofile-like file.  You could probably also do what you want in xorg.conf
[16:37] <Pumpkin-> nyuszika7h: you can, but I'm not 100% sure how. I think you need to investigate "gtk-alternative-button-order", but I'm not 100% sure where you apply it. Have a google.
[16:38] <nyuszika7h> ok, thanks
[16:39] <kunji> jrib: In some older gnome documentation it says that if first looks at /etc/profile then ~/xprofile and finally at ~/.xprofile might that be it?  There is a /etc/profile on my system, looks like some sort of bash script, there is also a /etc/profile.d folder.
[16:39] <kunji> *it not if
[16:39] <jrib> kunji: oh apparently, /etc/xprofile gets sourced to in /usr/sbin/lightdm-session, so you can use that.  Again, I don't know what way is "best"
[16:39] <Taneb> How can I enable netwoorking and connect to wifi from the command line
[16:39] <Taneb> ?
[16:40] <jrib> kunji: you wouldn't want to put it in /etc/profile since that will be executed even when there's no X.  It would still work, you'd probably just get some error output if you logged in without using X
[16:41] <kunji> jrib: Ah, I see, thanks, I think I should be able to get this working now ^_^
[16:43] <AwAk3e> This morning I woke up to this error - "Reboot and Select proper boot device" on my ubuntu installation. I've checked to see that the BIOS detects the hard drive and it does, I also went through the installation process again and it detected the hard drive there, however when I use fdisk and having booted from a bootable disc, it can't find the drive. Does anyone know how to resolve this?
[16:43] <juk> which pdf editor to use? (insert/update pages)
[16:43] <jrib> kunji: for an opinion, I would probably use xorg.conf or find the right xorg.conf.d/ directory that I could put a file under.  You'll have to then find the right syntax, but it will be an actual configuration file and not a place where you can just run commands.  That's my 2 cents anyway.  But any of the files I mentioned should end up working :P

[17:13] <Coldfire202> I'm having an issue, I install Ubuntu through the Windows installer to dual boot. And when I reboot it says I need to put my windows disc in and finish my installation proccess. Of course I hit enter and it takes me the boot menu in which I can choose the Ubuntu or my Windows 7. Well, I hit Ubuntu and it gives me an error. Something with the .mbr or something like that.
[17:14] <escott> ShawnRisk, if you want 12.10 but it is not appearing in your upgrade options it is probably because you are configured to upgrade only to the next LTS (ie 14.04) that can be changed through the software settings gui or through /etc/apt it think
[17:14] <sorbanos_> Coldfire202: you have issue with your hdd try in windows chkdsk /f
[17:14] <cariveri> ShawnRisk: alright.
[17:15] <ShawnRisk> escott: which settings?
[17:16] <escott> ShawnRisk, software sources -> Updates -> bottom selector "Notify me of a new Ubuntu version"

[17:21] <juk> escott: i think pdfjam is what i need
[17:21] <escott> VroomPed, in the correct way. you cant just put it on the flashdrive like it were a file you downloaded
[17:21] <VroomPed> Alright, then how should I do it? This is my first ubuntu project
[17:22] <sorbanos_> escott: i know and that is why i'm telling him to use chkdsk /f

[17:22] <escott> sorbanos_, ok. just wanted to make sure you caught that fact.
[17:22] <OerHeks> Guest83585, easy way is fresh install, much faster than 2x upgrade
[17:22] <sorbanos_> escott: sure no prob

[17:22] <escott> VroomPed, what OS are you downloading the iso with?

[17:24] <escott> VroomPed, you can find instructions on ubuntu.com for creating a CD on ubuntu.com they may also indicate what you need for the USB

[17:33] <shanky_ty> Hi, i have dlink wifi usb stick but there is problem if i set dns 192.168.1.1 (i.e my wifi router) so sometime net wont work but when i change my dns to dns which is in router it works fine
[17:33] <cariveri> thanks escott. I was running ubuntu 11.10 and firefox crashed. logout and reboot stuck so I had to hard reboot. since then the connection to the wlan seems to work (icon tell so), but ping on any address on the network gives me host unreachable now. no wonder firefox and other software cant get a internet connection.
[17:34] <skeuomorf> shanky_ty you shouldn't set DNS to 192.168.1.1
[17:35] <skeuomorf> shanky_ty you can use Google's open DNS service with IPs (8.8.8.8) and (8.8.4.4), or you can use your ISP's DNS which is probably set automatically
[17:35] <Dreadneck> shanky_ty, yeah... 192.168.1.1 is usually your default gateway... you can try setting your DNS to 208.67.222.222 if you want to use openDNS
[17:35] <escott> cariveri, sounds like the WPA handshake failed. not sure why that would be happening after a hard reboot. have you tried a full poweroff/poweron
[17:36] <cariveri> escott: yes I have.
[17:36] <shanky_ty> But should my computer's dns be 192.168.1.1 it should work too ..? my question why it doesnt work ..

[17:39] <paradise89> enyone for 5vs5
[17:39] <llutz> shanky_ty: for most soho-routers gateway=dns-server/proxy/cache, so it's nothing wrong with using the router as dns. still doesn't explain why it fails sometime

[17:41] <shanky_ty> actually when i select automatic still dns field is enabled
[17:42] <vifanq> escott: about the 32bitness of x86
[17:43] <sgtkilljoy> u can use DHCP and manual dns, yes
[17:43] <Dreadneck> shanky_ty, if you're using Automatic DHCP then you shouldn't have to set anything.  If you want to manually enter DNS then click on your network icon, edit connections, select wired or wireless, then enter the info in additional DNS servers
[17:45] <sgtkilljoy> tho ur DHCP server will prob assign ur dns by default

[17:55] <cariveri> escott: I just booted in a live cd of puppy linux and by wizard I could easily connect to the wlan, but still the same problem. looks like my router is the source of evil here ? I rebooted that lately too. maybe something went wrong there.
[17:56] <flow__> jjgalvez__, it's easy to 'fix' the rtl8180 driver
[17:57] <jjgalvez__> flow__: how?
[17:57] <nizor> 9ja p
[17:57] <flow__> jjgalvez__, what driver are you actually using ? if it's not 8180 ... blacklist the one you have
[17:57] <flow__> jjgalvez__, it will force linux to use the next available one
[17:58] <escott> cariveri, could be.
[17:58] <jjgalvez__> I am using the rtl8180
[17:58] <escott> cariveri, don't really have any good diagnostic ideas except disabling WPA temporarily and seeing if that helps
[17:59] <flow__> jjgalvez__, try blacklisting it, maybe it will work; or try the developers website

[17:59] <ubottu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit
[18:00] <RichiH> actually, we killed a server
[18:00] <jjgalvez__> flow__: if I blacklist rtl8180 I do not any wireless, so I don't think the card works with any other driver

[18:01] <Dizzle> does anyone know of a tool , plugin , something of the sort that can on the fly normalize audio output across the whole system? so like if i have 2 video files and a game with way different volume levels and i play them it adjusts to a set "perceived volume"
[18:01] <flow__> jjgalvez__, when i installed the linux binary driver from the official website, it installed rtl81892 ... so i had to blacklist it
[18:01] <escott> juk, never used it
[18:01] <flow__> jjgalvez__, i'm also using rtl8180
[18:03] <juk> escott: just pdfunite in the same poppler...
[18:03] <juk> \/found :p
[18:03] <jjgalvez__> flow__: I didn't install anything from the vendor, just popped the card in, it workd fine before with 11, but not in 12.04 it has been having issues, dropping connections and horribly slow speed
[18:04] <flow__> jjgalvez__, then install from the vendor! it happened to me too, just remember if you have another driver ... blacklist it
[18:06] <jjgalvez__> flow__: install the driver from realtek? the chip in the card is listed as RTL-8185 or goto the actual manufacture website?
[18:07] <flow__> jjgalvez__, for example i have tp-link ... i went to tp-link's website and found my driver there
[18:08] <jjgalvez__> flow__: BTW how id you know it installed the 81892 driver? or rather were did you find what to blacklist. And do you have to rebuild the driver everytime there is a new kernel?
[18:08] <sgtkilljoy> jjgalvez__: wat driver is currently installed?
[18:09] <jjgalvez__> sgtkilljoy: rtl8180
[18:09] <flow__> jjgalvez__, yes, about the kernel part! It bugs me as well ... about the driver ... type nm-tool and see the driver being used
[18:09] <flow__> jjgalvez__, also, there should just be an install script ... just run that :D

[18:39] <jrib> kunji: right, I meant packages.  But if you use a tool like nvidia-settings, then you could possibly overwrite the xorg.conf with it
[18:39] <flow__> jjgalvez__, do you have build-essential ?
[18:40] <flow__> jjgalvez__, and the autorun file shoud be there O.o
[18:40] <kunji> Sheikhmak: You just asked the impossible, it's not going to happen.  I think you mean for it to just be running as intended with MINIMAL slowing down, lag, and not having the processor pegged at 100%.
[18:40] <jjgalvez__> flow__: yes I have build essential
[18:41] <flow__> jjgalvez__, i suggest trying autoconf, and then make, make install; but the chances for this to work are minimal
[18:41] <ubar> can anyone help me with metasploit.. Currentrly installed on ubuntu 12.10
[18:42] <Sheikhmak> kunji, at least the optimal.
=== ubar is now known as tweikable
[18:42] <kunji> Sheikhmak: If you give more details it will help others to help you, for instance, what have you tried so far?  What specs does your pc have (a slow pc running flash is only ever going to be slow and will probably never be able to watch 1080p videos on Youtube).
[18:43] <tweikable> i seemed to not be connected to any database. and when i use db_connect  User:pass@127.0.0.1/metasploit it says perminion denied, basicly wronge password used for use msf
[18:44] <jrib> tweikable: wrong channel?
[18:44] <tweikable> i thought this would be the right channel
[18:44] <tweikable> becusase im using it on ubuntu 12.10
[18:44] <jrib> tweikable: I don't understand your question then
[18:44] <tweikable> i have metaspoit installed on my ubuntu
[18:45] <tweikable> i use msfconsole to access from ubuntu terminal
[18:45] <jjgalvez__> flow__, sgtkilljoy, thanks for the help guys, but I am going to just try a new card, this one is giving me to many headaches today
[18:46] <tweikable> problem that im havcing druing my set up. i forgot my password i put for use msf on metasploit. and im trying to seee if anyone here has used and is of some knowleged of basic metasploit commands. or how can i remove a whole directory beucase i cant figure a way to unistall it. this way i can reinstall it
[18:46] <tweikable> its under dir /opt
[18:47] <tweikable> its /opt/metaspoit-framework
[18:47] <tweikable> i tried rmdir but it tells me there files in that directory
[18:47] <sgtkilljoy> tweikable: see #metasploit

[18:52] <marcos> is there someone having a strange problem while installing applications through software center?
[18:52] <Gnea> MonkeyDust: funny, it doesn't mention socket1155 under Intel
[18:52] <marcos> some debconf window showing up
[18:52] <lv10> thanks for the link.
[18:52] <flow__> marcos, describe your problem please
[18:52] <Gnea> marcos: how is it a problem?
[18:53] <MonkeyDust> marcos  define "strange"
[18:53] <lv10> It has exactly what I needed. For some reason I wasn't able to get that link on google or searching within ubuntu
[18:53] <marcos> it's a blank debconf window
[18:53] <Blackouter> !
[18:53] <marcos> with no content at all
[18:53] <Gnea> marcos: try pressing the 'tab' key
[18:53] <MonkeyDust> marcos  start from the beginning, what brings you here, what were you doing
[18:54] <Gnea> MonkeyDust: he's pretty much explained that already
[18:54] <marcos> ok, let me start again
[18:54] <Sheikhmak> so here's my CPU stats, a 2 year old computer http://pastie.org/5783889, Browser is  Chromium 23.0.1271.97 on Ubuntu 12.10 [xubuntu x86_64] kernel 3.5.0-17-generic, running flash 11.2.202.261  when I play a video on any site, even in 720p or lower. cpu usage dramatically increase. I watch my logs, no errors reported. I switch to firefox 18.0, manually install the latest flash I can find 11.2.202.261, same effect.
[18:54] <lorenzo> hi! where should I put an alias that I created for the bash shell?
[18:55] <lorenzo> I tried .profile but no luck
[18:55] <marcos> when i try to install any app from the software center
[18:55] <marcos> some debconf window shows up
[18:55] <jrib> lorenzo: ~/.bashrc
[18:56] <marcos> but it's a blank window, with nothing at all
[18:56] <lorenzo> jrib: worked. thanks ^^
[18:56] <magma> Anyone here notices that chromium works better with ubuntu than firefox?
[18:56] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: what about cpu/mobo/gpu temperatures?
[18:56] <marcos> the worst is that it doesn't go away
[18:56] <lotus> hey, my mouse cursor is moving on inverted axis -- how can I fix this?
[18:57] <MonkeyDust> magma  great, then it's easier to decide which one you prefer
[18:57] <sgtkilljoy> marcos: odd, mabe try a "sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update"
[18:57] <Gnea> magma: they both work about the same, chrome is just faster since firefox has more bloat
[18:57] <marcos> and a have to log out then in again
[18:57] <marcos> i tried the clean option but it still happens
[18:58] <Gnea> marcos: perhaps using software center isn't a good idea, try doing it the old fashion way that sgtkilljoy suggests
[18:58] <craigbass1976> anyone?  I'm sure I installed this app, but I've got no recollection.
[18:58] <magma> Gnea, not really. I'm used to firefox and I prefer firefox, but I've noticing that firefox is always slowing down my system
[18:58] <Sheikhmak> Gnea never really checked, i'll find those out for you, laptop does get hot. I have it seating with a kickstand on my table at all time. sort of like a desktop now. to try to get the most air to it.
[18:59] <Gnea> magma: no, really. I've used firefox since its inception due to Netscape becoming bloated. Firefox has since become more complicated, but only to a point... it's still less resource intensive than Chrome is.
[18:59] <marcos> yes, using apt or synaptic this doesn't happen
[18:59] <marcos> only with software center
[18:59] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: okay. also, you may need to take it apart and use a can of air to blow out dust.

[19:00] <ubottu> marcos: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[19:00] <magma> So how do you Gnea explain that it is always slow after awhile of being running
[19:01] <sgtkilljoy> marcos: can u install apps with apt-get??
[19:01] <JoseeAntonioR> hey guys! I'm having a problem when running unity, it gives me this error: Compiz (opengl) - Fatal: glXQueryExtensionsString is NULL for screen 0. It was running fine until I reinstalled nvidia-current from the repos, any idea?
[19:01] <Gnea> magma: it doesn't handle memory very efficiently. it leaves some things running in memory instead of deleting them from memory.
[19:01] <Sheikhmak> Gnea oh that i do often, replaced heat sink back in november. even with windows, the dv7 pavillion is known to get hot. but not normal to get cpu process go from 8 to 65% on a play video.
[19:02] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: so that happens using flash? what about html5?
[19:02] <undrline> "Package libreoffice has no installation candidate" ... 10.04
[19:02] <kunji> Sheikhmak: only to 65% for flash?  That's nothing to worry about.
[19:02] <undrline> ppa added okay ... what's the problem?
[19:02] <marcos> sgtkilljoy: yes, with apt-get and synaptic i can install normally
[19:03] <OerHeks> undrline, so your ppa has no candidate for your ubuntu version, remove it and be happy with the current one
[19:03] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: also, did you replace any thermal grease on the heatsink?
[19:03] <sgtkilljoy> marcos: dont know, reinstall software center app maybe ?????
[19:04] <undrline> so I have to install using the old add-every-deb method?
[19:04] <Sheikhmak> Gnea not sure, lol I just replaced it tat for tat.
[19:04] <OerHeks> !ppa-purge | undrline
[19:04] <ubottu> undrline: To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[19:04] <Sheikhmak> kunju, that's normal really?
[19:04] <kunji> Sheikhmak: That is normal behavior for flash, remember it doesn't use the gpu in linux like it is able to on Windows.  It is quite cpu intensive.
[19:04] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: well if you didn't put any thermal grease between the heatsink and cpu, that's probably your problem
[19:04] <Sheikhmak> Gnea, you know what I'll find out how to do html5 only

[19:07] <Sheikhmak> Gnea i'll really look into that, god tips though. html, and grease in between sink.
[19:07] <Gnea> vjacob: this is a bit technical, but might be useful: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LaptopSpecialKeys
[19:07] <Sheikhmak> kunji i see.
[19:07] <marcos> sgtkilljoy: well, that i didn't try yet. It's odd , i dont use the software center often but last time i did it was fine
[19:08] <sgtkilljoy> shortstraw8: in httpd.conf
[19:08] <kunji> Sheikhmak: The heat may or may not be normal, I'm not familiar with the exact model of the laptop.  Right, see if playing html5 video is better, or playing files from your HD.
[19:08] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: yes, without the grease, the fan will only pull away the heat that the heatsink collects, which is less, since the thermal grease makes for a faster avenue for the heat to travel upon.
[19:08] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: it's the same basic reason why engines in cars and trucks need oil: not only to reduce friction, but to reduce heat so that they don't seize
=== newbie|2 is now known as wordpress
[19:09] <sgtkilljoy> Sheikhmak: use sensors to monitor cpu temp, find out wat normal for yours
[19:09] <magma> Gnea, do you usually have many tabs opened?
[19:09] <tweikable> is there a command for removing a whole dir. with files still in it
=== wordpress is now known as newbie|2
[19:09] <kunji> Sheikhmak: There is a good tool for downloading youtube videos (youtube-dl) that you can then play with say vlc.  Remember to run the update function within youtube-dl a few times though, the version in the software center is a few updates behind.
[19:09] <tweikable> when i try rmdir on dir /opt
[19:09] <shortstraw8> sgtkilljoy, is there a way to find it in command
[19:09] <tweikable> it says that can not do that becuase there is files inside of the directiory
[19:09] <Gnea> magma: depends. sometimes just a few, sometimes 20+. firefox never keeps up with chrome. NEVER.
[19:09] <sgtkilljoy> shortstraw8: grep -i 'DocumentRoot' httpd.conf
[19:10] <jhutchins> tweikable: Why do you want to remove /opt?
[19:10] <away> tweikable, rm -r dir_name
[19:10] <Gnea> magma: I can kill 15 tabs in chrome and it will help take the strain off of the system, but if I do that in firefox, it will take a little bit of strain off... sometimes firefox will simply crash.
[19:10] <vjacob> gnea: hmm, those both seem to offer only complicated or "many step approaches" to what it is that I want to do
[19:10] <kunji> Sheikhmak: Also, as Gnea is saying, you should never really be running without thermal grease.  It does work temporarily if absolutely necessary for tasks that don't drive the cpu hard, but you don't want to be doing that long term.
[19:10] <undrline> I still don't understand, I didn't have libreoffice, so I added the ppa, and libreoffice still wasn't available.  wiki says that it's available for 10.04 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibreOffice
[19:10] <tweikable> well i have metasploit on it . and i forgot my password to the metaspliont database
[19:10] <tweikable> so i want to reinstall it
[19:10] <vjacob> gnea, I take it your thinking is that I could assign a short-cut to each Fn key, e.g. F1, F2, etc.
[19:11] <przemek_> hello Dears , i have a question is bonnie++ can destroy data on my HDD when this benchmark is in progress? :)
[19:11] <tweikable> and its under dir . /opt/metasploit-framerwork
[19:11] <vjacob> gnea, I just want to free them up from use of Ubuntu, similar to what one can do in Mac OS X
[19:11] <vjacob> gnea with one check box or a settings file flag?
[19:11] <blkadder> przemek_: It shouldn't.
[19:11] <away> tweikable, why not just rm /opt/metasploit-framerwork ?
[19:11] <magma> Gnea, which one do you use after all?
[19:11] <tweikable> oooo i thought that was the same thing
[19:11] <Gnea> magma: chrome
[19:12] <przemek_> blkadder: thank You
[19:12] <magma> Gnea, you are saying chromium is more advanced than firefox? And that firefox doesn't keep up?
[19:12] <craigbass1976> http://thebestcabinetsite.com/mystery-googletalk-app.png   I can't figure out what this is.  Does it look familiar to anyone?
[19:12] <Gnea> vjacob: well different laptop manufacturers provide that information.. what do you have?
[19:12] <OerHeks> undrline, that wiki is wrong > https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=lucid no candidate
[19:12] <Gnea> magma: in my experience, yes.
[19:12] <vjacob> gnea: this isn't a laptop actually, it's an apple USB keyboard connected to a thinkCentre desktop pc
[19:12] <Gnea> magma: I use chrome across multiple platforms
[19:12] <jhutchins> tweikable: How did you intsall metasploit?  I'm asking these questions because deleting individual items can be a bad idea, it can prevent a package manager or install script from working.
[19:13] <magma> Gnea, right! That's what I said. What do you meant by bloat btw?
[19:13] <Gnea> magma: I already explained it.

[19:15] <magma> ok
[19:15] <koerper> quit
[19:15] <kunji> vjacob: Umm, in what context, just pushing the key by itself?  Or like the ctrl+alt+f1 for the virtual terminals?
[19:15] <jhutchins> magma: "Bloat" means code or features that the commentor did not request and feels is unnecessary and/or inefficient.
[19:15] <vjacob> gnea: wow that looks useful.
[19:15] <vjacob> thanks a bunch, I didn't come across that page until now
[19:15] <Gnea> vjacob: cheers
[19:16] <magma> Cause to swell with fluid or gas.
[19:16] <magma> ok thanks
[19:16] <vjacob> kunji: the difference between your questions isn't clear to me
[19:16] <Sheikhmak> funny never heard of the grease, the retailers should at least say something
[19:16] <magma> jhutchins, which browser do you use btw?
[19:16] <jhutchins> magma: I use firefox.
[19:16] <vjacob> kunji: yes to pressing button, and yes that would also seem to entail answering yes to your second question
[19:16] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: they won't, they assume that you know what you're doing.
[19:16] <marcos> sgtkilljoy: i'll try to reinstall software center to see if it fixes the problem. If not, i don't have problem using apt or synaptic. Thanks for your time!
[19:17] <jhutchins> magma: Looks like I'm on 18.  I use chrome on Windows, and I like it.
[19:17] <Gnea> Sheikhmak: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7rPqCvCt0g
[19:18] <jhutchins> magma: I used to use konqueror and I really liked it but the developers didn't keep up with the code.
[19:18] <magma> jhutchins, on 18 what?
[19:18] <kunji> vjacob: If that link answered your question then don't worry about it.  I was just wondering if you were trying to assign the f1-f7 keys on their own, or in that particular combination because that combination for keys f1 through f7 is done at a lower level than where you would normally assign hotkeys, i.e. it works even when you can only access the terminal.
[19:19] <jhutchins> magma: version 18 of firefox.
[19:19] <vjacob> kunji: I'm not trying to assign combinations, just have the individual keys useable by applications such as 'mc'
[19:19] <jhutchins> kunji: f1-f7 work differently in console than they do in X.
[19:19] <vjacob> kunji, it hasn't answer yes and incidentally I can not access the console currently when in X
[19:20] <vjacob> -yes +yet
[19:20] <kunji> Sheikhmak: Really?!?!?  Stock heatsinks come with it applied, if you're buying aftermarket heatsinks it's assumed you already know.
[19:20] <magma> oh me too, don't you notice performance problems with firefox 18 jhutchins ?
[19:20] <vjacob> but there appears to be two different issues at work
[19:20] <vjacob> on the function of the individual keys, and one of the combination of keys (reacting to the individual programming)
[19:20] <kunji> jhutchins: I know, that's why I was asking what he was trying to do.
[19:21] <jhutchins> magma: Meh. No real problems. Then again there are bugs in the code that handles the history functions that I reported back when it was Mosaic.
[19:21] <craigbass1976> BAH!  It's a freaking Chromium plugin for Googletalk that runs whether I'm using Chromium or not.  Mystery solved...
[19:22] <kunji> vjacob: I think that post should get your keyboard operating normally, then you can just assign the hotkeys in the keyboard settings like you normally would.
[19:22] <jhutchins> kunji: There's nothing particularly special about those keys.  If you start fewer consoles they don't do anything.
[19:22] <vjacob> actually I hope I don't have to assign them still, since I don't have anything to assign them to
[19:22] <BigC85> Hey everyone is anyone familiar w/ the touchpad gestures in 12.10 every time I try a three finger gesture when I put three fingers on the trackpad the Dash opens any ideas?
[19:22] <jhutchins> kunji: You can also assign consoles to the other function keys.  Common practice used to be to dump the syslog to VT12.
[19:22] <vjacob> in other words I just don't want them to be assigned in X
[19:23] <vjacob> and also I would like that I'm allowed to switch to the console
[19:23] <kunji> jhutchins: Where are they assigned though, it shouldn't be in the Xsession at all, because they're accessible from outside of that.
[19:24] <vjacob> well thanks kunji and jhutchins for chipping in
[19:24] <jhutchins> kunji: I think getty sources the keymap files.  I'd have to look up what files it and X actually use.
[19:24] <jhutchins> vjacob: Ctrl-Alt-F1 should take you to console.
[19:24] <jhutchins> vjacob: How you go about assigning hotkeys varies with the desktop you use, I don't use the current Ubuntu defaults.
[19:24] <vjacob> jhutchins, does not (I have tried more than 5 times)
[19:25] <vjacob> jhutchins, might it be a property of ubuntu-server default install?
[19:25] <LiThiuME3> Hey
[19:25] <BigC85> Hey everyone is anyone familiar w/ the touchpad gestures in 12.10 every time I try a three finger gesture when I put three fingers on the trackpad the Dash opens any ideas?`
[19:26] <kunji> BigC85: I am not familiar with them, have some patience, one should normally wait about 15 minutes or so before asking again.
[19:27] <LiThiuME3> Anyone familiar with compiling lftp with openssl on 12.04 I getting errors when I Make :S
[19:27] <Dizzle> does anyone know of a tool , plugin , something of the sort that can on the fly normalize audio output across the whole system? so like if i have 2 video files and a game with way different volume levels and i play them it adjusts to a set "perceived volume"?
[19:27] <BigC85> sorry for repeating I will control myself from now on ;)
[19:29] <vjacob> Dizzle, isn't that what Pulse or JACK does?
[19:29] <vjacob> or allows
[19:30] <Dizzle> vjacob: no idea thats why im asking? are those packages i can apt-get?
[19:30] <oyvind81> laser
[19:30] <vjacob> Dizzle, that was a rhetorical question I'm afraid :)
[19:30] <vjacob> I guess it was more of a hint or an idea
[19:31] <LiThiuME3> :S
[19:32] <vjacob> LiThiuME3, no me. Is there are good reason you have to get it compiling rather than using a packaged binary?
[19:32] <vjacob> -are +a -no +not :)
=== codezombie|away is now known as codezombie
[19:37] <kunji> Dizzle: JACK is primarily for those that need low latency in their audio input output, but it could be useful for that.  The Medibuntu people are likely to be much more knowledgeable on the subject.
[19:38] <kunji> Dizzle: You can apt-get it, I think a GUI that uses it is jackd
[19:38] <Dizzle> kunji: im reading pulse audio is default now in ubuntu , is there a quick way to see if thats what im running?
[19:38] <Dizzle> kunji: looks like pulse may be more simple for what i need
[19:40] <kunji> Dizzle: You should be running it unless you've already been messing with your sound, it may do what you want.  Have you looked at the sound settings, and then the applications tab, it should show running applications that are outputting sound and you should be able to adjust the volume of each there.
[19:41] <Dizzle> kunji: my problem isnt nessicarly different applications but different media files within the same application
[19:41] <Gnea> Dizzle: if you're already running Ubuntu, you're already using pulse
[19:42] <Hwkiller> Dizzle: hmm... there is a way to normalize volume in pulse
[19:42] <LiThiuME3> aahhhhhh vjacod left :|
[19:42] <LiThiuME3> :(
[19:42] <Hwkiller> I think you have to make a custom sink and route all audio to it; unfortunately I don't recall how to do that
[19:43] <kunji> Dizzle: Oh, different ones in the same application, the application needs to do it's own leveling then.  Are you playing them at the same time, or going track to track?
[19:43] <BluesKaj_> Dizzle, then you need ubuntu-restricted-extras
[19:43] <Dizzle> kunji: track to track , and the software wont do it thats why im looking for a system wide solution
[19:43] <Dizzle> BluesKaj_: ubuntu-restricted-extras for what?
[19:43] <kunji> Dizzle: Which software won't do it?  There are ones that will.
[19:44] <Dizzle> xbmc kunji
[19:44] <BluesKaj_> Dizzle, various media file extentions
[19:44] <Dizzle> it has dynamic range compression for individual tracks but not track to track
[19:44] <kunji> Dizzle: Ah, doesn't xbmc use different players for different filetypes?  Or at least it can, not sure if that's default behavior.
[19:44] <BluesKaj_> er extensions
[19:45] <Dizzle> kunji: audio is going to output over the same device though
[19:45] <kunji> BluesKaj_: That's the issue here
[19:45] <kunji> Dizzle: Indeed, so I see why you're looking for a system wide solution now
[19:46] <BluesKaj_> kunji, ok , carry on
[19:46] <Dizzle> kunji: do you think pulse would be easier to setup than jack , id prefer command line if possible
[19:47] <kunji> BluesKaj_: Well, I don't know if you were going somewhere else with that, but he isn't having problems playing files, he is trying to level sound between them when it may be different apps playing them.
[19:48] <BluesKaj_> use vlc , it plays practically every media file
[19:49] <kunji> Dizzle: I'm not sure, I have use jack mainly through the jackd GUI and I have not found it to be stable, which is I believe why Ubuntu (and most other distros) uses Pulse.  The medibuntu folks use jack though because they need the low latency for mixing and whatnot.
[19:49] <kunji> *used
[19:49] <Dizzle> BluesKaj_: um that defeats the purpose....
[19:49] <Dizzle> BluesKaj_: are you even paying attention
[19:50] <kunji> BluesKaj_: He's trying to do it for XBMC, though configuring XBMC to use VLC for all playback might be possible.
[19:50] <BluesKaj_> Dizzle, sorry guess i came in the middle of something
[19:50] <Dizzle> im not trying to play a vast array of media files , im trying to do system wide volume normalization
=== codezombie is now known as codezombie|away
[19:51] <BluesKaj_> thought xbmc had a normilze all audio levels option , Dizzle
[19:51] <kunji> BluesKaj_: That's just what I was thinking about
[19:52] <Dizzle> BluesKaj_: no that just sets all files to the same db , but many files have been encoded differently so that db point isnt the same "percieved volume" across multiple files
[19:53] <kunji> BluesKaj_: I think it may depend on the platform though, and I've never tried using it.  For instance, playback on a Raspberry Pi is done with omxplayer, whereas I'm not actually sure what it uses in a standard x86 install, maybe mplayer?
[19:53] <Dizzle> like some stuff is way lower than others when encoded , so if i set the system to -3db one file may be loud while the other is quite even though they have the "same" db level
[19:53] <Dizzle> quiet*
[19:54] <LiThiuME3> anyone familiar with lftp compiling with openssl ?
[19:54] <kunji> Dizzle: Applications have no concept of perceived volume, it varies within the same track -_-, e.g. anything by Beethoven
[19:55] <Dizzle> kunji: i realize that , what im trying to do is system wid e, not by application...
[19:55] <Dizzle> lets say i have a volume value of 1-100 one file is at 45 one is at 80 , i want a max value of 75 and anything below 60 i want boosted to 75 etc
[19:56] <kunji> Dizzle: No I mean, the computer in general has no concept of that, the only way you could manage that is with some custom work and it would require input from a mic to measure that.
[19:56] <kunji> Dizzle: that's exatly the dB levels you were referring to though
[19:56] <kunji> *exactly
[19:56] <BluesKaj_> unless the audio is run thru an audio mixer that set a particular db level in real term
[19:56] <BluesKaj_> terms
[19:57] <Dizzle> in theory wouldnt pulse be the mixere?
[19:57] <Dizzle> mixer*
[19:57] <BluesKaj_> pulse is just a processer layer
[19:58] <kunji> I think BluesKaj_ means a physical mixer, but yes Pulse is a mixer in the software sense of the word.
[19:58] <BluesKaj_> kunji, no there are software mixers available
[19:59] <kunji> BluesKaj_:Well, pulse is one then, though it may not offer that particular functionality

=== Kowalczy1 is now known as Kowalczyk
[20:00] <kunji> Dizzle: Anyway, I think the Medibuntu people will know more, many of them play with the advanced sound stuff on a regular basis and a fair number do audio work for a living.

[20:01] <Dizzle> maybe i can use smart in some way to help with the reference level

[20:13] <jhutchins> airdem: One of the reasons not to use mint is that it doesn't have good irc support.  The mint channels on other networks like oftc might be better.

[20:41] <Eagleman> I want to make offsite backups to one of my external servers, i think the sftp protocol is the best for copying files once a week. Is it smart to use the credentials and mount the remote sftp folder as local folder ?
[20:42] <daftykins> Eagleman: doubt it. looked into rsync?
[20:42] <raub> daftykins: that is what I would suggest myself: rsync. Can even do incremental madness with it
[20:42] <Eagleman> daftykins rsnapshot yes, however i am running a tar file of weekly.0 and then copy it to multiple locations, and one of that should become my remote server
[20:43] <daftykins> i find the natural aim to try and mount such remote dests a bit of a mistake
[20:43] <Eagleman> I currently have rsnapshot running on my external disk, and since i have only 9.5 GB on my remote server, its not smart to rsnapshot then

[20:48] <kunji> leonce: I know, but you can still force it, I think with a directive in xorg.conf?  I saw something this morning, lemme see if I can find it
[20:48] <daftykins> Eagleman: never looked into it. i think it's do-able though
[20:49] <Eagleman> daftykins, the tar file is also encrypted. I know what i want, the only thing missing is on how to do it

[21:28] <Labradoodle> Hello I just installed LAMP server on my ubuntu  system. I want to know where is the file where I put my php code. I think it's a www folder or something, anyone know?
[21:28] <kunji> jeff4: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table There is an mbr, it seems that it's use is optional, but you might not be able to use that considering your win8 setup, This should provide some insight though: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB2#UEFI_systems  and these may also be helpful: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/grub2-does-not-boot-with-gpt-4175414534/  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php

[21:37] <_val_> Hi there. After upgrading to gnome 3.6 the keybindings have changed. I used to press ALT+left mouse-button to drag a certain button but now Super-key has taken the functionality of ALT.

[21:38] <dbrom> hello Having a issue with a freenas install anyone here
=== massimo is now known as Guest90856
[21:39] <Lars_G_> Hello all.
[21:39] <dbrom> I am back
[21:39] <ross410> anyone know? It seems that the drive is unformatted but it is not. Maybe I could use fsck?
[21:40] <kunji> _val_: you mean gnome shell?... sorry I've only used Unity with Ubuntu, I don't really know my way around Gnome 3.  Is that handled by compiz though?
[21:40] <k1l_> dbrom: better ask the freenas support
[21:40] <jeff4> i fixed my problem by copying the bootmgfw.efi and bootmgr.efi files from the extra copies of it i found in my windows install
[21:41] <_val_> kunji: no there is no compiz
[21:41] <jeff4> fixmbr wouldve bricked my install
[21:41] <_val_> just gnome-shell
[21:41] <Lars_G_> Quick question, I've just upgraded a 10 lts to a 12.04 lts, inside a xen DomU, I had some fights with the thing, finally it boots, but during boot I have an error about /tmp not being started because the fs type is missing (error passed I'm trying to find it to see if I can copy) and thus mount all failed, should I a) regenerate the initrd, b) add /tmp (type tmpfs) on fstab, c) something else?
[21:41] <kunji> ross410: What was the issue again, I missed your original question.
[21:41] <k1l_> _val_: you are sure the 3rd party upgrade to 3.6 didnt break that?
[21:41] <jeff4> ubuntu is still showing up in my efi boot list though even after resetting all bcd stuff and deleting all traces of ubuntu in my efi partition
[21:42] <kunji> jeff4: It wouldn't have bricked it, it just wouldn't have done anything, there is space reserved for the mbr whether or not it is used.
[21:42] <jeff4> kunji: oh good to know
[21:42] <_val_> k1l_: I wish I knew. There is no compiz installed so there is no 3rd party package installed
[21:42] <ross410> I was in Hirens mini-xp and I was trying to get it to see my second hard drive so I clicked "update driver" for that hard drive in device manager and now the drive looks like it is unformatted, tho it is not
[21:42] <jeff4> i was just really afraid it would try to convert the gpt to mbr
[21:42] <ross410> kunji, ^^
[21:42] <k1l_> _val_: which ubuntu do you use and how did you upgrade on gnome 3.6?
[21:43] <kunji> jeff4: Nah, see the protective MBR stuff here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table

[21:46] <Shev> in the pyside webpage, its says they have a channel on freenode
[21:46] <kunji> ross410: Ok, so there are no lines for the partitions, aka /dev/sdb1 with the types of paritions?

[21:47] <Shev> ok
[21:47] <Shev> thanks!
[21:47] <Fuchs> Shev: you need to be identified with nickserv for that, though
[21:47] <OerHeks> Lars_G_,  upgrade in xen, is this your own  local server or from a provider ? maybe they can provide you with a 12.04 image
[21:47] <Fuchs> Shev: do you have an account here already?
[21:47] <_val_> leonce: what ALT+left-mouse-key supposed to do, now  super-key+left-mous-key does the job. I didn't ask for that change and it's quite annoying.
[21:47] <kunji> ross410: Or that might be it if there is only one partition for the whole disk, but the partition type should be there then.
[21:47] <Fuchs> Shev: if not: see http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup or /msg nickserv help register  for the short version
[21:47] <ross410> kunji, That disk has no partitions
[21:47] <k1l_> kunji: i dont think we can help with fedora problems here. they should be supported in the fedora channel
[21:48] <Lars_G_> OerHeks: My own server. it is upgraded already.
[21:48] <k1l_> _val_: there is a big difference in that on ubuntu and fedora. please keep it to the fedora support
[21:48] <_val_> k1l_: totally agree. I thought there is some general setting concerning gnome
[21:48] <Lars_G_> OerHeks: I am using -default-pae which I will change to -virtual eventually, I'm in pv mode, yet I need only to solve this /tmp diatribe for now
[21:49] <ross410> kunji, yeah looks like it doesnt list the partiton type for that disk onlu
[21:49] <kunji> ross410: No partitions, or the whole thing is one partition, in the first case you're going to need to do the file recovery stuff... which I am unfortunately unfamiliar with.  In the second case, we need to know what the partition type is so we can mount it with the right driver.
[21:49] <OerHeks> Lars_G_, did 12.04 give you a PAE kernel too ?
[21:49] <ross410> kumo, it was ntfs
[21:49] <kunji> k1l_: Oh, sorry, who was using Debian again?
[21:49] <Lars_G_> OerHeks: Yes, I'm on the default-pae on 12.04
[21:50] <Lars_G_> OerHeks: 3.2.0-36 I think
[21:50] <Lars_G_>  3.2.0-36-generic-pae
[21:50] <k1l_> kunji: i dont think we need to discuss this here :/
[21:50] <zzach> With    socat TCP4-LISTEN:port1,fork,reuseaddr SYSTEM:" sed -u -e 's/pattern1/pattern2/g' | (socat - TCP4:localhost:port2 )"      it is possible to modify client->server traffic with socat (browser access to port1, real server listening at port2). Do other socat options exist in order to also modify traffic in other (server->client) direction?
[21:50] <kunji> k1l_: pm me then
[21:50] <_val_> lol @ kunji ^^
[21:51] <konam> is there a safe way to remove a kernel?
[21:51] <_val_> Yeah, I don't fancy eye-candy but they should have kept things consistent
[21:51] <OerHeks> Lars_G_, oke, i am not sure howto fix your /tmp but i wondered "about /tmp not being started because the fs type is missing (error passed " what error exactly ?
[21:51] <konam> the last kernel update for 12.10 broke a functionality i need
[21:51] <_val_> not change ALT function to Super-key
[21:52] <zyngawow> Please, I need help.. I've tried everything on the internet and nothing worked.. I think I know what my issue is, but I dont know how to resolve it.. I have a RT3092 wifi card and it does not detect any networks and is stated as unavailable. I think the issue is that linux downloaded an incorrect driver, that would explain why it worked on a fresh install but it doesnt now.
[21:52] <Lars_G_> OerHeks: Let me see if dmesg has it, I think the error is pre-root rotation so I'm not sure
[21:52] <k1l_> konam: remove the linux-image- from that kernel. but keep atleast one kernel :)
[21:53] <ross410> kunji, so to sum it up the disk is all one partition and the file system is ntfs, although fdisk does not show this.
[21:53] <konam> k1l_ yeah, i just want to remove the last one because it is the one being point to by the "ubuntu" on the grub main menu... can i make grub point to one of the older ones by default?
[21:53] <toni_> hola

[21:56] <ross410> kunji, it says the partition table is msdos
[21:56] <kunji> _val_: Oh you're the one on Fedora -_-, yeah, Fedora has their own support.. for some reason I was thinking you installed gnome-shell on Ubuntu.
[21:57] <leonce> beats me no clue
[21:57] <kunji> ross410: It doesn't have a line like this from my system for an NTFS drive: 1      1049kB  1000GB  1000GB  primary  ntfs         boot
[21:57] <kunji> ross410: ?
[21:58] <ross410> kunji, that disk is the only one that doesnt have that line. parted says the table is msdos
[22:00] <OerHeks> Lars_G_, oke i found this when / does not mount correctly from 10.04 to 12.04.1 ( note the .1) maybe you just have to mount your /tmp manually and continue the upgrade >> http://askubuntu.com/questions/168485/the-disk-drive-for-is-not-ready-yet-or-not-present-message-on-boot

[22:05] <kunji> ross410: Hmm, well, we can try mounting it, but I really don't want to tell you accidentally to do anything that might make things worse.  How about we try mounting it read only?  mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb path/to/mountpoint       You can create a mountpoint first if you don't have one, for instance mkdir /media/NTFSDrive

[22:10] <orudie> hi. I am running ubuntu 12.04 with two monitors. When I switch between desktop spaces (with "ctrl+alt left, right), it shifts two desktop spaces left or right. Is there a way so that it shifts only one workspace, instead of two ?

[22:38] <oscar-juvfc> someone has used laptop-mode-tools and worked on ubuntu 12.04??
[22:38] <jhutchins> wjtaylor: Probably just sector alignment, and a bit extra for the MBR area.
[22:39] <escott> jbuncher, sounds like you need to run a DNS server on your network

[22:40] <escott> wjtaylor, nothing unusual about that partition
[22:40] <wjtaylor> I'm guessing that's why it gpt is why it starts at 1049
[22:40] <wjtaylor> I'm used to MBR....
[22:40] <jbuncher> escott, it used to work (on the campus network), but then I tried to tighten up my firewall rules and I could no longer ssh in via the hostname.  I'm not sure if that's the reason why, but if there's a hole I need to put in the firewall to register with DNS, I'd like to find out what it is.
[22:41] <escott> jbuncher, if you were blocking DNS it would be pretty obvious

[22:43] <ericfffff> Trying to follow this.  Manually installed the drivers from the website since 13.1 just came out yesterday.

[22:43] <jbuncher> escott, is there something that would prevent my machines from registering their hostnames with the DNS servers?
[22:43] <davidjonez> anyone know why the install file while in a live session won't work?
[22:44] <c_smith> davidjonez, what install file?
[22:46] <wjtaylor> can I change the boot partition with parted?
[22:46] <davidjonez> "Install Xubuntu 12.10" when I execute it nothing happens and when I try it in the terminal I don't have permission but I also forgot the sudo line used to have permission.
[22:47] <escott> jbuncher, the fact that no such registration mechanism exists
[22:47] <jbuncher> escott, well, that would do it.  Now I guess I have to try to figure out the right DNS server.  odd that it just stopped working all of the sudden on two machines though.
[22:48] <c_smith> davidjonez, that's ubiquity, try opening an Terminal and running "ubiquity"
[22:48] <kunji> wjtaylor: I don't see why not

[22:49] <c_smith> if nothing happens there, run "ubiquity -d"
[22:49] <wjtaylor> kunji: do you know the command? I can't boot without external media...
[22:49] <c_smith> davidjonez, no, simply "ubiquity"
[22:49] <c_smith> because the executable is in a folder the system looks in by default.
[22:50] <kunji> wjtaylor: Hmm, I don't know it off hand, do you have access to a GUI, I'm guessing you're using the liveCD no?  So why not use gparted?
[22:50] <c_smith> davidjonez, did that work?
[22:51] <wjtaylor> kunji: I'm on an xt2 tablet. It installed the boot loader on the thumb drive, I installed from.. (not sure why). So I need the thumb drive to boot. I just want to move the boot loader to /dev/sda1
[22:51] <escott> wjtaylor, your disk is not GPT. the 1Mb alignment has nothing at all to do with GPT
[22:51] <davidjonez> no, I got a value error : bad marshal data
[22:52] <davidjonez> Did the same thing with ubiquity -d
[22:52] <c_smith> davidjonez, sec
[22:52] <kunji> wjtaylor: Oh, ok, you need to just install it to the right device, maybe you'll need to set a boot flag, but we'll see.  I'll link you the page in a sec
[22:53] <wjtaylor> kunji: exactly!
[22:53] <davidjonez> ok
[22:53] <wjtaylor> I usually do it with fdisk, but can't use it.
[22:53] <c_smith> davidjonez, looks like you may have found a bug.
[22:53] <c_smith> davidjonez, which at that point, you'll want to report it with as much info as possible.

[22:54] <escott> !grub | wjtaylor the first thing i sent you has grub install instructions...
[22:54] <ubottu> wjtaylor the first thing i sent you has grub install instructions...: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[22:55] <kunji> wjtaylor: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2_from_a_Working_System  This should get GRUB2 installed to the right place, that partition might need to have the boot flag set, which you can use gparted for (if you have a GUI and install it, sudo apt-get install gparted) or parted, but you might need to read the man page to figure it out exactly.

[22:55] <dingo311> any ideas why "sudo chmod go=rx storage1" leaves the permissions as drwxrwxrwx?
[22:55] <wjtaylor> escott: thanks. I've read that.
[22:55] <escott> dingo311, what kind of format is the disk
[22:55] <davidjonez> alright is there a way I can send you screen shots on xchat of what's happening while I try to run the file?
[22:56] <wjtaylor> kunji: ok. I'll see if I can change it
[22:56] <c_smith> davidjonez, all I can recommend is imgbin then linking the image, or if it's in Terminal, pastebin.
[22:57] <c_smith> pastebin for copying terminal/other text output, imgbin for screenshots
[22:57] <davidjonez> alright
[22:59] <dingo311> escott: according to fstab, ntfs
[22:59] <hays> is there a channel for chrubuntu?
[22:59] <escott> dingo311, NTFS does not support posix permissions. you can only change the permissions at the entire filesystem level through mount options
[23:01] <dingo311> escott: so edit the fstab?
[23:01] <escott> dingo311, sure
[23:01] <davidjonez> http://pastebin.com/zG7UiLb9
[23:01] <davidjonez> thats the terminal text from running ubiquity/ubiquity -d
[23:02] <dingo311> escott: ok, and the filesystem can stay ntfs?
[23:02] <escott> dingo311, changing /etc/fstab doesn't do anything to the disk
[23:03] <kunji> escott: Hmm, yeah, his partitions don't look like gpt, wonder why he couldn't set the boot flag with fdisk.

[23:03] <ShawnRisk> How do I make Ubuntu 12.10 unmuted on bootup?  Everytime I load Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10 the sounds are mute.
[23:03] <c_smith> davidjonez, looks like it's crashing before even drawing anything.
[23:03] <c_smith> hence why it appears to not open
[23:04] <jhutchins> kunji: Is he running DOS?
[23:04] <c_smith> davidjonez, and it looks to be trying to import something that may or may not be corrupt/
[23:05] <c_smith> davidjonez, only thing I can recommend trying is burning the disk again. or making a liveUSB
[23:05] <airglide> can someone help me, I've made an application and I want to link the files with a specific extension to the program and give it an icon, I've tried creating a mime type and then copying a .svg in to /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable, but it doesn't work
[23:05] <davidjonez> alright I'm running it off of a live usb right now
[23:05] <davidjonez> should I just format it and try again?
[23:05] <lkjh> hi
[23:05] <MonkeyDust> airglide  you too, ask in #ubuntu-app-devel

[23:07] <MonkeyDust> lkjh  mind your language here
[23:07] <dingo311> escott: my only understanding of what to do would be change the filesystem, which involves formatting, i dont want that
[23:08] <bennett13> anyone? :S
[23:08] <escott> dingo311, i would look at your existing mount options and modify them as you need. check the output of "mount" you need to change dmask and fmask
[23:08] <dingo311> escott: my understanding if what you said is cahnge the perms at mount, which to me means edit fstab
[23:09] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my question?
[23:09] <bencc> can I create a sandbox with apparmor?

=== Shogoot_ofwork is now known as Shogoot
[23:17] <cuco> is there anyone?
[23:17] <BlitzHere> Since I had GRUB installed, I get the kernel and initrd.gz for 12.10 and out them into /boot and followed instructions in the wiki. However, the installer doesn't seem to recognize my ethernet connection, which is weird because the debian istaller worked just fine last week and the internet works. Can anyone help

[23:18] <BlitzHere> I have a P4 1.6 Ghz computer with 512 MB of RAM and I want to install lubuntu 12.10. My CD drive stopped working for some reason and my BIOS isn't doing too well with my USB flash drive.
[23:19] <BlitzHere> My ethernet card is a Realtek 8139d, which has had it's drivers put into the linux kernel a while ago...

[23:23] <k1l_> raven_: just ask
[23:24] <benedict_> hi, is it normal that users can read other users home directories?
[23:24] <raven_> well i have no sound, when i watched tutorials on youtube they said i should install some package because i have an 8core amd, but i cant find it in the software center, i also havent installed my graphics because theres a few options and i dont know which is best
[23:25] <escott> benedict_, is it usual for a car to be blue?
[23:26] <raven_> :(
[23:26] <escott> raven_, help you with what?
[23:26] <escott> benedict_, if you want to change it you can change your umask
[23:26] <VlanX> I have a server with four NICs, any advice how can i have my routing table fixed w/out having a mess everytime i plug or umplug any interface?
[23:27] <escott> raven_, what is the output of sudo lshw -c sound
[23:27] <benedict_> escott: ok, let me set my question more precisely: can ubuntu usres read each others home directires by default?
[23:27] <benedict_> escott: chmod?
[23:27] <escott> benedict_, default permissions are 755 so yes
[23:27] <BarkingFish> raven_, since you're new - don't paste that in the channel, if you get a result - put it on http://paste.ubuntu.com and post the url here
[23:28] <benedict_> escott: ooohhh! ok , didn't know that
[23:28] <warz> hi all. whats the best way to manage two har d drives? i have ubuntu installed on my small SSD drive, and i have a 1TB drive that i'd like to basically install everything on. how can i set ubuntu up to use that drive for storing most things?
[23:29] <escott> warz, what are you considering "most" you could just put /home on that mechanical disk
[23:29] <benedict_> escott: do i have to remove read/execute for group and/or others?
[23:29] <benedict_> drwxr-xr-x 37 benedict benedict 4096 Jan 21 20:22 benedict
[23:29] <escott> benedict_, chmod -R g-rx o-rx $HOME
[23:29] <benedict_> drwxr-xr-x 17 mister   mister   4096 Jan 21 21:35 mister
[23:30] <benedict_> escott: thank you
[23:30] <escott> benedict_, i dont see why you would remove rx from your own group
[23:30] <benedict_> escott: i am asking if i should
[23:30] <escott> benedict_, if you sleep better at night
[23:30] <benedict_> ?
[23:31] <benedict_> ah i see - each users has its own group
[23:31] <escott> benedict_, *should* you i have no idea. entirely up to you
[23:31] <benedict_> escott: so it's enough to just o-rx ?
[23:32] <escott> benedict_, enough for what? what is your usecase that concerns you?
[23:32] <BlitzHere> I have a P4 1.6 Ghz computer with 512 MB of RAM and I want to install lubuntu 12.10. My CD drive stopped working and my BIOS doesn't like USB flash drives. Since I had GRUB installed, I get the kernel and initrd.gz for 12.10 and out them into /boot and followed instructions in the wiki. However, the installer doesn't seem to recognize my ethernet card. My card is a Realtek 8139d, which has had it's drivers put into the linux kern
[23:32] <escott> benedict_, is that enough for a corporate server with many users. NO. is it enough for a home user again NO
[23:34] <benedict_> escott: it's a ubuntu 12.10, 2 users, one user is used to ssh to the machine by some of my friends. the other user is my private account. i just don't want them to peek around in my data
[23:34] <escott> benedict_, in that case it probably is sufficient
[23:35] <benedict_> escott: ok
[23:37] <benedict_> escott: thank you for your help
[23:37] <wjtaylor> How can I reinstall the wifi drivers?
[23:38] <benedict_> i will dive into the umask for long term solutions
[23:38] <escott> benedict_, it sounds like you just need to change your umask to 007
[23:39] <benedict_> escott: yep - but since i am not going to change the system much the umask will be relevant for future setups only
[23:40] <benedict_> although i think its an 'intersting' choice for default to make home readable for other users - it surprised me
[23:40] <benedict_> but i think that's ot
[23:41] <escott> benedict_, its a choice that is consistent with the ubuntu framework. it makes things "easier" for many use cases. There aren't that many cases where a umask of 007 is substantially more secure than a 002
[23:41] <escott> benedict_, and those cases where it is have dedicated people who know that it matters
[23:42] <benedict_> escott: ok, point taken
[23:43] <[TK]D-Fender> Hello all, over this past weekend I have updated both my office & home 12.10 installs and my nvidia drivers died on both of them and have spent a long tim trying to get working again.  Just when I think it's stable it goes back to offering me "low graphics mode" which doesn't actually work.  Is there a more common fix out at this point?
