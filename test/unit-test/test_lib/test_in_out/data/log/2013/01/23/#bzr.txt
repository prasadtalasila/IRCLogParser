[00:21] <chinoto> How do I uncommit, but maintain the state of the working tree?
[00:22] <lifeless> bzr uncommit
[00:23] <chinoto> well, I tried that, but "bzr st" isn't showing them
[00:24] <chinoto> ...ok what the heck?!?
[00:24] <chinoto> I just tried it again and it all of a sudden worked as expected >.<
[00:25] <chinoto> lifeless: that was weird... thanks
[00:26] <lifeless> np:)
[00:27] <chinoto> how do I un-add a file?
[00:27] <chinoto> without deleting it
[00:27] <LeoNerd> bzr rm --keep
[00:28] <chinoto> ah, I was trying to use revert
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:28] <LeoNerd> revert undoes editing a file
[00:29] <chinoto> I figured it might undo the added state as well :D
[00:33] <lifeless> it does
[00:33] <lifeless> bzr revert added-file will unadd it
[00:33] <lifeless> or it used to; may have been changed
[00:33] <chinoto> and remove it from the filesystem
[00:33] <lifeless> it didn't use to have that behaviour
[00:34] <chinoto> perhaps our version is flaky/old
[00:34] <lifeless> i'm slowly getting more and more out of date ;)
[00:34] <lifeless> chinoto: no, more likely my info is less current
[00:34] <lifeless> I haven't tracked the commit feed for a few years now
[00:46] <chinoto> well, that was messy
