[14:27] <brendand> bjf, when is the next kernels going to be built?
[14:27] <brendand> s/is/are/
[14:31] <henrix> brendand: we're skipping this cycle due to the .2 release.  i guess next cycle wont happen before the 1st week of Fev
[14:38] <brendand> henrix, are you waiting until after .2 is released or something?
[14:40] <henrix> brendand: yes, that's the info i have. here's the email on the kernel mailing list: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kernel-team/2013-January/024883.html
[14:42] <henrix> brendand: so, i guess the idea is to get some more testing on the current kernels
[14:44] <henrix> brb
[15:14] <bjf> brendand, i hoping that the next cycle will start feb 7th though it may be after that. we'll have to see when .2 is "in the can" and we can put new kernels into -proposed
[15:15] <bjf> brendand, we know that there will be a respin of quantal and lts-quantal at this point. we are working on a regression right now.
