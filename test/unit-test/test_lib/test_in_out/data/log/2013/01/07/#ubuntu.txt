[00:00] <warfar> also how do i set my shell's TERM variable?
[00:00] <Regretfulone> hey I will be right back guys ><
[00:00] <kylescottmcgill> Regretfulone: can you do me a favor, run this: lspci | grep -i network
[00:02] <dniMretsaM> warfar: TERM=<value>
[00:03] <kylescottmcgill> dniMretsaM: isnt it export TERMVAR=value ?
[00:03] <ActionParsnip> use export
[00:04] <Regretfulone> kylescottmcgill: I ran it and it jumped down to another line ready to go, sounded like hdd was doing something though. will you still be here in ten minutes or so? I gotta run to pick up my dinner
[00:04] <dniMretsaM> kylescottmcgill: I don't think so. could be, though. ActionParsnip: that's only if he puts it in a configuration file (like .bashrc), isn't it? which I guess is probably what he wants to do
[00:04] <kylescottmcgill> ya im will be here
[00:04] <Regretfulone> alright back in ten thanks for the help guys!
[00:06] <warfar> what about this? http://pastebin.com/XLruFKnk
[00:06] <kylescottmcgill> dniMretsaM: nah you need the export
[00:06] <kylescottmcgill> i just tested to make sure i wasnt being a spaz
[00:09] <jamin> is there a general way to inhibit volume automounting for a period of time?  I've searched and found the commands for udisks but that doesn't seem to have the desired affect as many volumes still get mounted (I suspect this is due to udisks2)
[00:09] <dpurgert> jamin, what do you mean? like for USB keys, etc?
[00:10] <dniMretsaM> kylescottmcgill: running "TERM=<whatever>" in a terminal sets the $TERM just fine
[00:11] <jamin> dpurgert, any volume really... but I'm working with LVM volumes on a removable drive specifically... trying to work up a script to free the drive automatically for removal
[00:11] <jamin> however, once I umount the volume and lvchange the volume to inactive some of them get remounted
[00:12] <dpurgert> jamin, hm, kind of a weird error that ...
[00:12] <jamin> I'm guessing there's a way to inhibit the process that mounts them as gparted and the ilk seem to do it
[00:12] <warfar> can somone please help me get lde to work?
[00:12] <kylescottmcgill> dniMretsaM: i tried, and it didnt work, im using ZSH if that matters much (ZSH is a superset of Bash, but idk)
[00:12] <dniMretsaM> kylescottmcgill: It works fine for me in both ZSH and BASH. odd
[00:13] <kylescottmcgill> meh
[00:13] <philly90> jamin: not sure, maybe   sudo service autofs stop   does the trick
[00:14] <jamin> philly90, no autofs here... just the desktop environment's automount facility... xfce specifically
[00:15] <kylescottmcgill> jamin: do you have gvfs running?

[00:17] <dariebi> hi all, a short question. if i want to do a right click (with touchpad) a rigthclick is working as a leftclick. the leftclick is working normal. has someone a idea?
[00:17] <jamin> don't believe that will stop it from mounting again will it?
[00:17] <kylescottmcgill> dariebi: are you using gnome? you can set this inside System Settings -> Mouse
[00:18] <kylescottmcgill> jamin: its the automounting used by Nautalis, and Thunar

[00:18] <dariebi> i was using mouse settings but it didnt work

[00:24] <dariebi> no i dont wanted to change left and right. only if iam push the right lick at touchpad the click works same as a leftclick. :-/ i dont know why ...

[00:26] <Raspootis> Evening. What's the best distro to run on an old Pentium 4 box with 1 gig of RAM (256 x 4)? http://imgur.com/a/WmxDo#5 (image  set of the box I found)
[00:26] <kylescottmcgill> :) disable Multitouch if you dont enjoy that
[00:27] <dpurgert> Raspootis, probably something lightweight.  All the better if you're not running X (not that it can't handle something like 12.04)
[00:27] <dariebi> oh yeah, thank you very much. see us. bye ;-)
[00:28] <Lunar_Lander> hi again
[00:28] <Lunar_Lander> alcaprawn, I have one more question
[00:28] <Raspootis> dpurgert: I got 12.10 running pretty smoothly on gnome-fallback with compiz effects on an old Pentium D, even though I had an okay GPU in there
[00:28] <Lunar_Lander> what did you mean about korean people in my PC?
[00:28] <Raspootis> I've never even heard of the GPU I have in this one, ATI 3003 or something
[00:28] <dpurgert> I've currently got this install running on a virtual box (because I'm continuing to break things, rather than my host OS) with like 1 or 2 GB of RAM, 1 proc, and pretty insubstantial everything else
[00:29] <dpurgert> though, a 10G hard drive might have been a little too small ...
[00:29] <mn2010> Anyone know how to automate gpg key signing? for repositorys
[00:29] <dpurgert> shell script, probably
[00:30] <kylescottmcgill> mn2010: idk about automation, but you could y | add-apt-repo..... the y at the font will answer everything with yes
[00:30] <Lunar_Lander> dpurgert, do you know how he meant that?
[00:31] <kylescottmcgill> wait y isnt installed by default
[00:31] <dpurgert> Lunar_Lander, "he" who?
[00:31] <kylescottmcgill> sorry its yes | add-apt-repo.....
[00:31] <Lunar_Lander> alcaprawn, the thing with the koreans in the PC

[00:38] <dniMretsaM> this channel has been quieter than I've ever seen it as of late
[00:38] <Rosenzweig> I didn't know about this wizardry of workspaces in Unity. Ctrl Alt Arrow and I can have multiple window environments.
[00:39] <ActionParsnip> Rosenzweig: Super + W shows all open windows too
[00:39] <Rosenzweig> Super? FN?
[00:39] <dpurgert> dniMretsaM, don't know really ... new to the channel
[00:39] <ActionParsnip> Rosenzweig: aka 'windows key'
[00:39] <dpurgert> what kind of black magic is this?!
[00:39] <Rosenzweig> all it showed me was a darker desktop screen.
[00:39] <Rosenzweig> Oh nevermind.
[00:40] <Rosenzweig> Yeah, thats nice.
[00:40] <ActionParsnip> Rosenzweig: do you only have one window open?
[00:40] <Rosenzweig> Yeah I see it.
[00:40] <Rosenzweig> I have one window in each of the four work spaces.
[00:40] <Rosenzweig> And they're full screen.
[00:40] <dniMretsaM> ActionParsnip: I always call it the meta key. once an Emacs user, always an Emacs user, I guess
[00:40] <Rosenzweig> Unity has some nice features, but I guess these are available in other desktop environments too.
[00:40] <ActionParsnip> dniMretsaM: its also called Mod4 :)
[00:41] <Rosenzweig> I don't know. I like being treated like a baby. Like for example, Steam told me to install the fglrx driver.
[00:41] <Rosenzweig> I never had Debian tell me that in Gnome 3.
[00:41] <kylescottmcgill> lol
[00:41] <Rosenzweig> Ubuntu is babby's first Linux but it's a decent Linux distribution.
[00:41] <ActionParsnip> Rosenzweig: yeah, steam also says to add the bleeding edge xorg, not wise in that case
[00:41] <dniMretsaM> yup
[00:41] <Rosenzweig> With tons of support.
[00:42] <Rosenzweig> You gotta' have that bleeding edge packages.
[00:42] <Rosenzweig> That's why I use Arch Linux.
[00:42] <Rosenzweig> It might break every package update but hey, I'm bleeding edge.
[00:42] <kylescottmcgill> i miss Arch
[00:42] <ActionParsnip> Rosenzweig: arch is offtopic here :)
[00:42] <Rosenzweig> I know, it was a joke.
[00:42] <Rosenzweig> Is Unity available on other distributions by the way?
[00:42] <Rosenzweig> I always wondered that.
[00:43] <dpurgert> I play around with a few distros ... though am using Ubuntu more than the others...
[00:43] <Rosenzweig> I have a Debian with broken drivers as my other distro.
[00:43] <Rosenzweig> I'm thinking of chucking it out.
[00:43] <ActionParsnip> Rosenzweig: its open source so its possible
[00:43] <dpurgert> yeah, I've got Mint, Ubuntu, slackware, and a few different server distros
[00:44] <kylescottmcgill> Rosenzweig: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unity
[00:44] <k1l_> Rosenzweig: yes, unity is available for other distros but how or if they integrate it better ask the support of that distribution
[00:44] <ActionParsnip> semplice is my next distro to test
[00:45] <Rosenzweig> Interesting.
[00:45] <Rosenzweig> Sorry installation of driver failed. Please have a look at /var/log/jockey.log for more information.
[00:45] <Rosenzweig> Interesting.
[00:46] <arij> is there a channel for ubuntu phone?

[00:46] <Rosenzweig> Yeah, that.
[00:46] <arij> thank you
[00:48] <ActionParsnip> kylescottmcgill: seems so, its basically the OS I make with Ubuntu
[00:48] <kylescottmcgill> :D fiar enough
[00:48] <ActionParsnip> kylescottmcgill: ubuntu mini + fluxbox + slim + wicd + xcompmgr + docky

[00:49] <kylescottmcgill> use ranger and everything else terminal apart from things like skype and chrome
[00:50] <ActionParsnip> kylescottmcgill: yeah, same :)
[00:50] <thufir_> I don't see skype listed for 12.10 to install.  do I need to add a repo?
[00:50] <ActionParsnip> kylescottmcgill: i even twitter with twidge :)
[00:50] <ActionParsnip> thufir_: enable the partner repo
[00:50] <kylescottmcgill> lol :D nice, i use the t ruby gem, i will have a look at that
[00:51] <kylescottmcgill> thufir_: you can also download the Deb from their site, and install it that way
[00:51] <thufir_> ActionParsnip: thx
[00:52] <thufir_> kylescottmcgill: thx
[00:52] <thufir_> ActionParsnip: add to sources.list, is that right?
[00:53] <ActionParsnip> thufir_: there are 2 lines commented out for it, uncomment them and run:  sudo apt-get update
[00:54] <thufir_> ActionParsnip: got it.  do I need both?  I'm not doing sources, tho.
[00:55] <thufir_> oh, for installing ruby, is there a way to now get 1.9 without RVM?  Or, do you need to use rvm if you're doing any devel with ruby?
[00:57] <marcio> hello friends, i have been trying to update my software in lubuntu for over a week now but i keep getting an error that says "failed to download repository information"
[00:57] <marcio> can someone tell me whats going on?
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> thufir_: yes, do both the deb and deb-src lines
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> marcio: run:  sudo apt-get update    pastebin the output please
[00:57] <Gnea> marcio: have you run  sudo apt-get update  first?
[00:57] <marcio> i have, but ill do it again and post the output
[00:58] <thufir_> Gnea: and clean or autoclean (I use aptitude different syntax I think)
[00:58] <Gnea> thufir_: not sure why clean or autoclean are necessary
[00:58] <thufir_> ok

[00:59]  * thufir_ dyslexia suffers from
[00:59] <kylescottmcgill> thufir_: i would use RVM, its easier to deal with, and doesnt require sudo, if rvm is a pain, you can sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.1 or 1.9.3
[00:59] <marcio> sorry im new to the linux world, so what exactly is pastebin?
[00:59] <Gnea> marcio: it looks like all of your base repositories are there, it's just that a ppa that you setup isn't working right anymore
[01:00] <Gnea> !pastebin | marcio

[01:00] <marcio> ohhhh i see
[01:00] <marcio> im sorry
[01:00] <Gnea> :-)
[01:00] <kylescottmcgill> thufir_: i think apititude is just sudo aptitude install ruby1.9.1
[01:00] <thufir_> kylescottmcgill: thanks.  last time around with installing binaries, I couldn't get it to go.  I find rvm a pain, but already have it working, so was just curious.
[01:01] <ActionParsnip> marcio: http://ppa.launchpad.net/screenlets/ppa/ubuntu/dists/   doesn't support quantal
[01:01] <Gnea> marcio: it's okay
[01:01] <kylescottmcgill> ok it looks like 1.9.1/3 are in the reps
[01:01] <poincare101> AAAAAAARGH ext4 and unity make a terrible combination
[01:01] <ActionParsnip> marcio: remove the PPA, it is of no value to you now
[01:01] <ActionParsnip> poincare101: never had an issue
[01:01] <kylescottmcgill> poincare101: whats wrong with ext4? i think its a nice part type
[01:01] <k1l_> poincare101: that is a strange conclusion
[01:01] <marcio> oh dear, and how do i do that?
[01:01] <poincare101> ActionParsnip: ext4 is dropping my file requests (saying bandwidth is too high) and Unity is just a complete PITA over remote xorg
[01:02] <kylescottmcgill> poincare101: really? i have an ssd and its writes as fast as it can read
[01:02] <ActionParsnip> poincare101: then just run the app you need, rather than the whole desktop....
[01:02] <kylescottmcgill> i think you might have another issue :D
[01:02] <nibbler_> what is the diffrence between the packages fglrx and fglrx-updates?
[01:02] <poincare101> ActionParsnip: probably a much better idea
[01:02] <Gnea> marcio: same way you added it, just use the -r option
[01:03] <ActionParsnip> marcio: what is the output of:  grep -R screenlets /etc/apt/*
[01:03] <kylescottmcgill> where did that wifi guy go? im sure its been longer than 10 mins :D
[01:05] <marcio> action ummm i have the output, how do i paste it without pissing off the room? lol i installed pastebin, do i have to restart?
[01:05] <ActionParsnip> marcio: use http://pastie.org
[01:05] <jamin> marcio, http://paste.ubuntu.com/
[01:05] <ActionParsnip> marcio: no need to restart
[01:05] <dpurgert> kylescottmcgill, his wifi never came back up :)

[01:08] <ActionParsnip> marcio: not all PPAs support all releases
[01:08] <kylescottmcgill> i would like to see what he had, the broadcom issue for me at least has been a huge pain, and there is no real fix for it, apart from ripping the source code apart and recompiling it... i have read up a lot on it
[01:10] <marcio> rm: cannot remove `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/screenlets-ppa-quantal.list*': No such file or directory
[01:10] <marcio> i got hat error
[01:10] <marcio> that*
[01:10] <ActionParsnip> marcio: sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/screenlets-ppa-quantal*

[01:12] <kylescottmcgill> #winehq are your friends
[01:12] <ActionParsnip> VlanX: chage it to what?
[01:12] <VlanX> ActionParsnip: not to use sda1 but sdb1
[01:12] <VlanX> cause sda1 is an SSD
[01:13] <kylescottmcgill> oh, is that the Internet Cache or something?
[01:13] <marcio> actionparsnip, it worked! thank you sooooo much!
[01:13] <frozenlock> Anyone familiar with libusb can tell me what this means? "USBController::usb_find_ep(): libusb_get_config_descriptor() failed: LIBUSB_ERROR_IO"
[01:13] <marcio> i have a question, whats the difference between sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade?
[01:13] <ActionParsnip> VlanX: I'd copy the ~/.wine folder to the other partition, then make a symlink to it in $HOME
[01:14] <jamin> marcio, the first updates the list of known packages
[01:14] <kylescottmcgill> marcio: update, updates the repo lists, upgrade, upgrades the packages
[01:14] <kylescottmcgill> sorry package lists...
[01:14] <marcio> ohhh i see
[01:14] <VlanX> ActionParsnip: ok but am i supposed to set wine to change the path?
[01:15] <marcio> can you guys reccomend me some good sources for mastering ubuntu and linux? its one of my main resolutions this year
[01:15] <EndUserX> don't forget about sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[01:15] <jamin> VlanX, no need, the symlink serves that purpose for you
[01:15] <dpurgert> marcio, "update" just updates apt's repo list
[01:15] <kylescottmcgill> do-release-upgrade :D
[01:15] <VlanX> jamin: so i might not really know what a symlink is
[01:15] <VlanX> just a second
[01:16] <dpurgert> bah, I need a bigger screen so I can watch this better ...
[01:16] <EndUserX> what is the exact difference between dist-upgrade & upgrade anyways, I know dist-upgrade will pull in a new kernel if available
[01:16] <kylescottmcgill> VlanX: its a short cut
[01:16] <kylescottmcgill> dpurgert: what are you watching?
[01:16] <kylescottmcgill> oh you mean IRC
[01:17] <kylescottmcgill> EndUserX: Distibution Upgrade? updates you to the next release as well as kernal etc
[01:18] <kylescottmcgill> 13.04 will be next i assume
[01:18] <jrib> !dist-upgrade | EndUserX
[01:18] <ubottu> EndUserX: A dist-upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer needed. This will not bring you to a new release of Ubuntu, see !upgrade if that is your intention.
[01:18] <nibbler_> kylescottmcgill, EndUserX: distupgrade might pull new dependencies...
[01:18] <dpurgert> kylescottmcgill, yeah, IRC is partially covered by Document Viewer ...
[01:18] <ububh> I'm on LiveDVD of Ubuntu 12.10 amd64 with a UEFI laptop. Fedora is installed and has its own entry in UEFI boot option and boots via gurb-legacy. Gentoo has its own boot option and boots from EFISTUB.
[01:18] <EndUserX> kylescttmcgill so dist-upgrade works exactly the same in ubuntu as on debian
[01:19] <ububh> How can I install Ubuntu and keep Fedora and Gentoo with their own boot methods_
[01:19] <jrib> EndUserX: basically dist-upgrade is a way to tell apt it's ok to install packages that are needed if dependencies change.  So for example you have the linux-image package that depends on the latest linux-image-some-specific-version-here package.  And that dependency changes when a new kernel is released
[01:19] <ububh> ?
[01:19] <kylescottmcgill> EndUserX: no i was wrong... help says    dist-upgrade - Distribution upgrade, see apt-get(8) but ubottu says something else
[01:19] <ububh> !uefi
[01:19] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[01:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> Hello everybody. I am having trouble getting a 5721 NIC to perform any kind of network activity. This is a rather old copy of ubuntu server (10.10), but it was working a short while ago. The NIC and the switch it is hooked into both show activity, and I know DHCP should be available because this machine (which is on the same switch) is able to obtain an IP address via DHCP. I have also made sure that tg3 and bnx2 are loaded. Howev
[01:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> er, dmesg says that the "link is not ready".
[01:20] <jrib> ububh: I think grub2 will detect your other installs and chainload them automatically
[01:20] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: Maverick is no longer supported
[01:20] <EndUserX> I know sometimes when a new kernel is available upgrade will say "some packages held back" but running a dist-upgrade will install them
[01:20] <jrib> EndUserX: yes, do you understand why now?
[01:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> Then I suppose I should back some stuff up and use 12.04LTS
[01:20] <ububh> jrib: me too. But I'm searhing for someone that knows it-ll work for sure
[01:21] <EndUserX> usually linux-image is one of the packages held back
[01:21] <EndUserX> jrib sort of
[01:21] <VlanX> ActionParsnip: I solved the problem, i just set the Temporary Internet FIles to read only :)
[01:21] <jrib> ububh: worked for me last time I tried...
[01:21] <EndUserX> jrib it's basically because the new image would require new dependencies or am I mistaken ?
[01:22] <jrib> EndUserX: if a package changes dependencies (like linux-image does when a new kernel package is available) a plain apt-get upgrade won't install it.  Yes.
[01:22] <marcio>  thanks for all the help guys, have a great night
[01:22] <Sir_Fawnpug> Ugh, I stupidly didn't create a separate home partition when I set this server up
[01:22] <ububh> jrib: ok. I'm not afraid in losing gentoo uefi boot because gentoo.efi resides in /boot/efi/EFI/gentoo/gentoo.efi
[01:22] <ububh> jrib: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Creating_an_EFI_partition
[01:23] <EndUserX> jrib cool, so you can run dist-upgrade without worry it will bump you to ubuntu 13.04 (as example)
[01:23] <ububh> jrib: should I remove EFI partition that Fedora's installer has created_
[01:23] <kylescottmcgill> EndUserX: my new understanding is thats what do-release-upgrade is
[01:23] <EndUserX> when I ran sidux they used dist-upgrade to update to the latest release but sidux be weird
[01:23] <Brunbook> meu Ubuntu 12.10 trava tela fica toda  preta com letras mas musicas no fundo toca normal somente a visualização alguem me ajuda?

[01:24] <Brunbook> Ubuntu 12.10 hangs my screen is all black with lyrics but music plays in the background normal only viewing someone help me?
[01:24] <milamber1> !es | Brunbook
[01:24] <ubottu> Brunbook: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[01:24] <EndUserX> well thanks again guys, I have been meaning to ask that question for awhile too :-)
[01:25] <Brunbook> Ubuntu 12.10 hangs my screen is all black with lyrics but music plays in the background normal only viewing someone help me?
[01:26] <kylescottmcgill> Ive had similar issues, and it came down to my xcompmgr panicing
[01:26] <ActionParsnip> VlanX: I'd have gone for the symlink :)
[01:26] <kylescottmcgill> only way around it was to jump over to TTY1 and pkill mplayer/flash or restart X
[01:26] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: just reinstall and use your backups for user data
[01:26] <EndUserX> Not wanting to go off topic but this is really cool. It's a Linux timeline tree graphic http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9a/Gldt1009.svg
[01:26] <dpurgert> I'm out.  g'night.
[01:26] <ububh> jrib: also because thwe installer recognize only gentoo and not fedora. I'm afraid it'll wipe the other OS
[01:27] <Sir_Fawnpug> ActionParsnip, well the trouble is that I didn't have a good backup solution going at the time (this is minecraft data)
[01:27] <VlanX> ActionParsnip: but there is no point for wine to have the temporary folder, for whatever reason it got to >23GB which is crazy
[01:28] <ActionParsnip> VlanX: yikes!
[01:28] <EndUserX> ububh it may not wipe it but sounds like you will have to add it to grub later, double check your partitions in the installer before you install to be sure those partitions will not be touched
[01:28] <Sir_Fawnpug> I am sure I will get everything backed up eventually, I just need to find a USB key to sneakernet it
[01:28] <Sir_Fawnpug> And to not make such a stupid mistake in the future, haha
[01:29] <ububh> EndUserX: I'll try the manual partitioning
[01:29] <kylescottmcgill> lol there was a distro called lindows...
[01:30] <ububh> EndUserX: can you please read something for me and tell me what do you understand?
[01:30] <EndUserX> ububh yeah back pedal in the installer to the partitioning screen and select manual partitioning for sure
[01:30] <kylescottmcgill> nice graph though
[01:30] <ububh> EndUserX: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Creating_an_EFI_partition
[01:30] <EndUserX> years ago lindows haha
[01:31] <EndUserX> looking at it now ububh
[01:31] <ububh> EndUserX: what do you understnad from sub-point 1 of the 2nd macro-point?
[01:32] <EndUserX> ububh which part?
[01:32] <EndUserX> what are you wanting to do specifically
[01:32] <ububh> sub-point 1 of the 2nd macro-point
[01:33] <ububh> EndUserX: "Mount point: /boot/efi (remark: no need to set this mount point when using the manual partitioning, the Ubuntu installer will detect it automatically) "
[01:34] <ububh> EndUserX: Fedora's installer (Anaconda) auto-created the EFI partition during install
[01:34] <EndUserX> oh I wouldn't worry about EFI unless you installed your other OSs in EFI mode
[01:34] <EndUserX> ahh gotcha
[01:35] <EndUserX> it says the manual should pick that up
[01:36] <ububh> EndUserX: so I only need to create / for Ubuntu and go straight?
[01:36] <EndUserX> so shouldn't be a prob, I never had to mess with it when installing ubuntu along side fedora
[01:36] <EndUserX> yeah just / should be fine and check to be sure any partitions you wanna keep are not marked for installation or formatting
[01:37] <EndUserX> it was gentoo it missed right?
[01:37] <EndUserX> but it saw fedora
=== DancingBear is now known as TabMeHarder
[01:38] <ububh> EndUserX: yup, I was a bit confused reading from the link I posted you. Thanks for explaining me the thing!
[01:38] <ububh> EndUserX: give me 1 sec to explain
[01:38] <EndUserX> no prob
=== TabMeHarder is now known as DancingBear
[01:39] <EndUserX> you can always add whatever OS it misses to grub after install so as long as it doesn't get overwritten
[01:39] <EndUserX> that was my main point I guess
[01:39] <Rosenzweig> I kind of wish Apple went bankrupt and some of their good programmers went to Ubuntu.
[01:39] <ububh> EndUserX: 1st of all I installed Fedora and I let the installer creating the default partition scheme, I only deleted swap and reduced size of / partition
[01:40] <EndUserX> here is a great grub2 tutorial if you need it ububh http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/grub-2.html
[01:40] <ububh> EndUserX: Fedora uses high-patched grub-legacy-efi
[01:41] <EndUserX> been awhile since I ran fedora, last version I installed was 16 I think
[01:41] <ububh> EndUserX: 2nd I installed gentoo and it's booting directly via EFISTUB with its own entry in EUFI boot
[01:41] <PeTaz> fedora is at version 17 EndUserX
[01:42] <EndUserX> in that case ububh I'd skip letting ubuntu install grub and add ubuntu to fedora's grub
[01:42] <ububh> EndUserX: mmm
[01:42] <ububh> EndUserX: should be better... Yup!
[01:45] <ububh> EndUserX: understood why ubuntu installer sees only gentoo! Ok, let it choose the option "install alongside gentoo"
[01:45] <ububh> EndUserX: Fedora and Gentoo partition won't be touched
[01:46] <EndUserX> cool
[01:46] <ububh> EndUserX: so, let Ubuntu auto-install and auto-configure
[01:47] <EndUserX> as long as that option doesn't include installing grub
[01:47] <tony1>  is there any one who can answer to me   ''how to Running Java Program from command prompt''
[01:47] <somsip> tony1: java -jar {file}
[01:48]  * ububh UEFI gives us a lot of cool improvements, but it-s a bit hard to work with... Just like the upgrade from grub and grub2
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> tony1, assuming its a .jar, `java -jar /path/to/file`
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> tony1, assuming its *not* a jar, you may need a java compiler first.

[01:50] <vect0r> I only play one game, and somehow it has a gold rating according to winehq, but after like 36 hours of trying every method I think I'm done, lol. Probably the fact that I'm using an AMD card.

[01:51] <vect0r> well I'd pay for a driver if it would fix the wine issue. The catalyst driver is running fine - can run Team Fortress 2 beautifully.
[01:52] <vect0r> or any linux game for that matter

[01:55] <warfar_> hey i have a problem
[01:55] <EndUserX> are you able to add entries to grub on your own then
[01:55] <PeTaz> http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI2Nzc
[01:55] <warfar_> i am running on my flashdrive and it wasys no more space but i still have 7 gb left
[01:55] <warfar_> says*
[01:55] <EndUserX> I assume you must be versed in Linux with having gentoo installed :-)
[01:55] <ububh> EndUserX: it's not so guru!
[01:56] <ububh> EndUserX: simply keep most of the things at their default values to get Gentoo booting into a DE
[01:56] <ububh> EndUserX: the fun part is the manual configuration of the kernel
[01:57] <EndUserX> ububh my prob is I tried to take a shortcut and follow the gentoo quick install guide but I did get it to a DE, I installed lcde
[01:57] <EndUserX> lxde
[01:57] <ububh> EndUserX: where's the prob?! It's already a good thing!
[01:57] <EndUserX> yeah I kept having probs with the kernel and grub with gentoo lol
[01:58] <ububh> EndUserX: no problems... The only thing is that you need a lot of time for tweaking
[01:58] <EndUserX> I learned allot that day though
[01:58] <tony1> when i run java version, the out put is no command 'java-'found
[01:59] <ububh> EndUserX: for example, I can't get my external usb hdd automounted in gentoo.
[01:59] <ububh> EndUserX: I'm trying to get it work
[01:59] <EndUserX> tony1 can't you run a js file just like a shell script example sudo sh ./myprog.js
[02:00] <ububh> EndUserX: in common distros (openSUSE, Sabayon, Fedora, Ubuntu) you simply plug your 1TB ntfs formatted ext hdd to get it automounted or simply click on the notification tray to get it mounted
[02:00] <PeTaz> you need root to run java program?
[02:00] <EndUserX> oh wait, you need the jre then it sounds like
[02:01] <EndUserX> PeTaz was just an example
[02:01] <PeTaz> sure...
[02:01] <tony1> yes i cant open on sudo sh./myprog.js
[02:01] <ActionParsnip> tony1: there is a SPACE between the word 'java' and the '-version'
[02:01] <ActionParsnip> tony1: java -version     NOT  java-version
[02:02] <EndUserX> good point ActionPartnership
[02:02] <PeTaz> *ALERT* Major Network Performance Regressions In Linux *ALERT*
[02:02] <ububh> EndUserX: finshed. let's reboot
[02:02] <ActionParsnip> tony1: you may want to check your space bar works ok
[02:03] <PeTaz> http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI2Nzc
[02:03] <EndUserX> ububh I think in gentoo you have to compile that stuff into the kernel for automount
[02:04] <PeTaz> automount is a security hazards

[02:09] <rifter> there's a place to clear history, clear cookies, clear cache, but not to clear forms that I can see. and the FAQ specificaly says hwo to clear things that are NOT forms
[02:09] <ububh> EndUserX: There is no Fedora's entry, but it's fine, because its partition is still there! :]
[02:09] <ActionParsnip> tony1: did you run the command yet?
[02:09] <rifter> but nothing on forms there, or in the help
[02:09] <EndUserX> yeah so just need to add fedora to grub ububh and you will be ready to rock and roll

[02:10] <ActionParsnip> tony1: run:  java -version     you can copy and paste to the terminal
[02:11] <ububh> EndUserX: I don't remember... What is used in Ubuntu to add GRUB entry?
[02:11] <ububh> EndUserX: os-prober?
[02:12] <EndUserX> should be able to just sudo nano /boot/grub/grub.cfg I think and add the entry in and then run sudo update-grub
[02:13] <IdleOne> ububh: os-prober works
[02:13] <EndUserX> I'm not familiar with os-prober
[02:13] <EndUserX> how does that work?
[02:13] <ububh> IdleOne: is that the autosearch and autoadd OSes, right?
[02:13] <IdleOne> ububh: correct
[02:13] <ububh> IdleOne: sudo os-prober
[02:13] <excalibas> entify excalibur
[02:14] <ububh> IdleOne: with root I mean
[02:14] <IdleOne> EndUserX: basically it looks for other OSes and adds them to grub

[02:14] <EndUserX> hah I never knew, os-prober looks cool

[02:19] <Wraithan> Howdy, not an ubuntu user but I dumped it on my girlfriend's computer. Was wondering if ubuntu 12.04 came with an IM client like pidgin or if she'd need to install it via the app store thing y'all have. I know it has facebook integration which if I recall from a friend used epiphany which also has other IM backends
[02:19] <Wraithan> I am not with her to be able to just dig through, so I thought I'd ask you folks!
[02:21] <xangua> Wraithan: it comes with emphaty
[02:23] <spacejammin> hi
[02:23] <Wraithan> xangua: empathy that is what I was thinking, cool, I'll see if she can find that, thanks!
[02:26] <moes> I used Startup disk creator to install Ubuntu-12.04 to a 16gb flash drive set reserved extra space at 4 mib...when I try to open 4.3gb file I get the error: "could not find file/cow"
[02:26] <ububh> fine.
[02:27] <ububh> when pressing F12 at boot I can choose Fedora loader, gentoo loader and ubuntu loader
[02:27] <ububh> ubuntu loader load then grub2
[02:27] <ububh> and ubuntu's grub2 menu shows ubuntu+fedora+gentoo

[02:33] <Tmacy> hi
[02:33] <grahamsavage> so that it doesn't through an error?
[02:33] <grahamsavage> if the releases directory is empty
[02:33] <grahamsavage> i've been playing for a while.. can't work it out
[02:34] <kylescottmcgill> why dont you just pass the errors to /dev/null
[02:34] <grahamsavage> because if it's a permissions error
[02:34] <grahamsavage> i need to know
[02:34] <grahamsavage> it's just in the case it's empty i don't care
[02:35] <kylescottmcgill> 2>/dev/null
[02:35] <kylescottmcgill> rm --recursive $(ls -btd /srv/ph/apps/dd/releases/* | tail -n +4) 2>/dev/null
[02:36] <grahamsavage> yeah but that will pipe all errors right?
[02:36] <kylescottmcgill> if rm cant find anything it will send those errors to /dev/null
[02:36] <kylescottmcgill> is ls is returning the error, move the 2>..... around a bit
[02:37] <asw3> will NTFS on DOK work good?
[02:37] <kylescottmcgill>  rm --recursive $(ls -btd /srv/ph/apps/dd/releases/* 2>/dev/null | tail -n +4)

[02:37] <asw3> in ubuntu?
[02:37] <kylescottmcgill> etc**
[02:37] <grahamsavage> ohh yes
[02:37] <grahamsavage> :)
[02:38] <grahamsavage> kyle: thanks :D
[02:38] <grahamsavage> i think that's going to work
[02:38] <kylescottmcgill> np :)
[02:38] <asw3> so if my dok have NTFS its will be stable in ubuntu?
[02:38] <kylescottmcgill> asw3: whats a dok?
[02:39] <asw3> disk on key
[02:39] <ActionParsnip> asw3: ntfs is readable and writable in ubuntu

[02:39] <kantlivelong> hey all.. how can i rerun the prompts for an install of softwarE? i
[02:39] <ActionParsnip> asw3: not 100%, it is proprietary to Microsoft

[02:40] <asw3> so ubuntu will not ruin my file system?
[02:40] <doctor_how> Hail, gentlemen. My USB mic isn't showing up in ubuntu sound settings or alsamixer, although it does show up in the output from lsusb. My Google-fu hasn't licked the problem yet but just wondered if somebody could point me in the right direction.

[02:40] <asw3> thanks you
[02:40] <kantlivelong> kylescottmcgill: when doing apt-get install there were some prompts asking for values.. i want to reshow them
[02:40] <ActionParsnip> moes: did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded (if you manually downloaded the ISO)
[02:41] <kantlivelong> kylescottmcgill: removing/installing doesnt show them again
[02:41] <kylescottmcgill> kantlivelong: dpkg-reconfigure
[02:41] <doctor_how> Plugs and plays just fine on roommate's Ubuntu box, too. So it's not the mic.
[02:41] <mili> Hi.  Just set up 12.10 on someone's laptop.  the wifi stays connected but internet access is laggy, goes in spurts, pages won't load then instantly do on a refresh, torrents are almost unusable.
[02:41] <kylescottmcgill> you have to that in order to get some of those prompts back, but generally once things are set, you can edit the config files (for some things)
[02:41] <moes> ActionParsnip, I Ran md5sum burned to cd then used to startup disk creator
[02:42] <kylescottmcgill> moes: you know 4mib is tiny yeah?
[02:42] <Dunitek> Mili: Where did you get the drivers?
[02:42] <mili> Dunitek the defaults from the install
[02:43] <Dunitek> mili, Did you by any chance check Additional Drivers from the settings menu?
[02:43] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: inside alsamixer, can you press F6 (i think) and it should show you the different input options etc
[02:43] <mili> i'll doublecheck but i'm pretty sure.  i was having trouble installing things from repos and fiddled with sources a bit ago, so i think i ticked that one off too
[02:43] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill: Tried that too, doesn't seem to do anything.
[02:44] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: also when you plug it in, run dmesg to see if error spawn
[02:44] <kylescottmcgill> errors**
[02:44] <troop> hello again. after installed nvidia driver, purple boot screen is broke. it doesnt effect booting but not nice view for me. can i fix it?
[02:44] <kylescottmcgill> troop: does it stop you from getting in?
[02:44] <mili> actually it's now saying there's 223 updates ... that it didn't show when i checked right after install 2 hours ago.
[02:45] <troop> no only i see text, i boot normally but not looks good
[02:45] <mili> i'll assume they'll help the issue.  or rather, hope so.
[02:45] <Dunitek> When you're arround the PC - Go to System -> Administration -> Additional Drivers and double check
[02:46] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill: Ayup, this is what I get from dmesg, a new lead for googling at least https://gist.github.com/4471895
[02:46] <Dunitek> Also, look up the wireless card to see if there is some third party driver for it
[02:46] <kylescottmcgill> yeah thats kinda weird
[02:47] <troop> can i fix it?
[02:47] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: sorry that last message was for you
[02:47] <doctor_how> yeah thanks
[02:47] <mili> heh, there's no 'administration' ... a few things seem odd about this install.  i'll let the updates run and if it stays weird i'll try checking drivers
[02:48] <kylescottmcgill> troop: if it boots i would leave it, otherwise it could be a grub boot command thing... it could be a lot really
[02:48] <vitimiti> o/
[02:48] <mili> also since they are used to windows i will probably switch them over to gnome .. this sidebar thing and the top bar/menu confuses them
[02:48] <Dunitek> Ohhhhhh! You are using Unity!
[02:49] <troop> it boots nicely but i don't like the view. low resolution and readable texts
[02:49] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill: Just disconnected and reconnected it and ran dmesg again and this time it didn't give a hardware error, otherwise same info
[02:49] <kylescottmcgill> troop: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[02:49] <kylescottmcgill> there is a section under Boot Splash Screen Issues
[02:49] <mili> yeah, was going to switch them to gnome once i got all the other little things done, but the wifi has been acting like this so i haven't gotten to do much
[02:49] <troop> kylescottmcgill, im looking
[02:50] <troop> kylescottmcgill, the topic "Boot Splash Screen Issues" is right?
[02:50] <Dunitek> mili: Try searching for Additional Drivers in the applications menu
[02:50] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: troop yeah
[02:51] <macmartine> My server started something new today where after a reboot things are okay but eventually all requests timeout with a 504 gateway timeout. I'm looking at 'top' and nothing appears to be taking too much memory. What else should I look into?
[02:51] <mili> hmmm the wifi seems to be fixing itself already.  it wasn't the router, or the service, 2 other laptops were doing fine on it when the new ubuntu machine was having problems
[02:51] <vitimiti> I have unistalled with purge fglrx* and xorg-server and reinstalled fglrx, but I still have this problem, can somebody help me having direct rendering? -> http://pastebin.com/pPmMCMKs
[02:51] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: open up a terminal, and cd /dev/snd/by-id/
[02:51] <Dunitek> mili: Found it: open the Software Sources app via the Dash (or through System Settings) and hit the ‘Additional Drivers‘ tab.
[02:51] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: then ls that directory and let me know if anything is in there
[02:52] <mili> anyway problems seem solved.  thanks for the help Dunitek.  i'll update the drivers if anything's there, after this update and reboot.  maybe you could tell me if there's a preferred method for getting gnome?
[02:52] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill is by-id indicating the device id gained from lsusb or something or is that the literal string?
[02:52] <mili> oh.  ok just found what you said.  it's set now on that
[02:52] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: im just trying to make sure its picking it up as a snd device
[02:53] <Dunitek> mili: sudo apt-get -y install gnome
[02:53] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: eg.: lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 12 Jan  7 00:57 usb-SteelSeries_SteelSeries_Diablo_III_Headset_000000000000-00 -> ../controlC1
[02:53] <Dunitek> sudo apt-get -y remove unity
[02:53] <kylescottmcgill> is mine
[02:53] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill: i'm stupid and as soon as I typed that just started looking around. nothing called by-id, only one called by-path
[02:53] <mili> heh that simple.  rad.  i'd like to leave unity in case they want to play with it more but default to gnome
[02:53] <Dunitek> mili: You can also make unity act like gnome: sudo apt-get install gnome-panel
[02:53] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: ok, if there is no by-id maybe it hasnt picked it up properly
[02:53] <mili> oh... maybe i'll try that first.  cool
[02:54] <Dunitek> Mili: One more thing: After it's installed, you'll need to logout, and then select "Gnome classic" for your session before you log back in again.
[02:55] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: under the by-path, is there anything, i also have a pci-xxxxx:xx:xxx-usb device
[02:55] <kylescottmcgill> but im pretty sure the ubuntu is just hating on your USB Headset
[02:55] <tmacy__> Tmacy:
[02:55] <doctor_how> hahaha sounds like.
[02:55] <doctor_how> all I get is pci-0000:00:1b.0 , probably the onboard
[02:55] <kylescottmcgill> ya
[02:55] <Tmacy> tmacy__:?
[02:56] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill: lemme go plug it into my roommate's computer and see what he gets, since i know it works there
[02:57] <kylescottmcgill> yeah what version is he using?
[02:58] <Wizek> Is there a Jing alternative for Linux/Ubuntu? Need not be a single software package, but It is a simmilar workflow I'm looking for: Shot -> edit/click_ok -> url_on_clipboard_already
[02:59] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill: he's on 12.10, i'm on 12.04
[03:00] <kylescottmcgill> he might have a later version of alsamixer maybe
[03:01] <kylescottmcgill> idk, if its not throwing an error im not sure how to fix it, googling it hasnt come up with much
[03:05] <frozenlock> I must change a line in the modprobe XPAD file and recompile it. I know what line to change, but I don't know where to find the file on my machine. Could I get some assistance? Pretty please? :P
[03:05] <leku> hello I'm trying to install 12.10 on an older dell inspiron e1505 with 1GB of RAM and a core duo proc
[03:06] <doctor_how> kylescottmcgill: thanks anyway, I appreciate the effort. this is the kind of crap that forces me to learn I guess.
[03:06] <leku> I used the i386 image and it won't even boot off of it on the dvd
[03:06] <leku> should I be using some other distribution for this POS?
[03:07] <daftykins> leku: x86 32-bit image would be fine, have you got the exact filename of the ISO you grabbed to hand?
[03:08] <leku> ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso
[03:08] <kylescottmcgill> doctor_how: thats the spirit :)
[03:08] <daftykins> leku: yeah that should be fine, can you confirm you wrote the disc properly? also, don't be offended, but you didn't write just the file to the DVD rather than as an image?
[03:09] <leku> i'll double check
[03:09] <ActionParsnip> leku: sounds fine to me, LXDE will give a snappier UI
[03:09] <leku> i just grabbed lubuntu
[03:09] <leku> seems to be written fine, will test on another laptop brb
[03:10] <donnie> No idea how to get a downloaded font to my fonts folder for OO use
[03:12] <mili> heh, unity is already crashing.  dash is up and i can't close it or alt-tab to anything else
[03:13] <xangua> gbnfgfhfh
[03:13] <leku> loads fine on my other machines
[03:15] <ActionParsnip> mili: hit ESC maybe...
[03:15] <mili> tried it
[03:16] <mili> but the system update finished so i'm just rebooting
[03:16] <mili> except it's not rebooting....
[03:17] <ActionParsnip> mili: press CTRL+ALT+F1 and log in there, then run: sudo shutdown -r now

[03:24] <leku> is it possible for a virus to not let me boot into linux?
[03:24] <leku> from a dvd boot
[03:24] <ActionParsnip> leku: you could get an MBR virus, I guess
[03:24] <leku> but theres no reason for it to read the MBR
[03:24] <leku> when booting off a cdrom
[03:24] <leku> this thing keeps going into XP when I try to boot off the dvd
[03:25] <mili> Dunitek there are no additional drivers available, it's not listing anything.  and network is still spotty.
[03:25] <warfar_> hey i keep getting not enough space but i have 8 gb on my flashdrive available
[03:25] <warfar_> how do i fix this
[03:25] <mili> it stays connected but pages hang for several seconds before loading, which isn't happening on any other machine
[03:26] <ActionParsnip> leku: did you change the BIOS to boot CD first?
[03:26] <mili> a speedtest shows 35Mb and fine upstream but it's like it's taking several seconds to just initiate contact with servers when trying to load pages
[03:26] <leku> yeah I have and I've tried the one time boot menu
[03:26] <ActionParsnip> mili: can you pastebin the output of:   sudo lshw -C network; lsb_release -a; uname -a
[03:27] <crammer> hi. im unable to switch my USB wireless adapter to monitor mode
[03:27] <ActionParsnip> leku: does the disk boot in other systems?
[03:27] <leku> yep
[03:28] <ActionParsnip> crammer: what wifi chip?
[03:29] <crammer> Realtek RTL8191SU
[03:29] <mili> ActionParsnip working on it, 1 sec
[03:29] <ActionParsnip> crammer: and the output of:  lsb_release -sc
[03:29] <mili> pastebin.com/hKh0LuZ5
[03:30] <crammer> ill get that. heres the command and output for now
[03:30] <crammer> http://pastebin.com/GEeKVqrP
[03:30] <mili> ew.  atheros.  bad.
[03:31] <crammer> ActionParsnip: output is "quantal"
[03:31] <grahamsa_> how can i check if a file exists?
[03:32] <ActionParsnip> mili: echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf > /dev/null
[03:32] <mili> also there's no 'gnome' in repos according to apt-get
[03:32] <grahamsa_> i.e. get true or false?
[03:32] <ActionParsnip> grahamsa_: use the 'file' command
[03:32] <aberrant> grahamsa_: test -e
[03:32] <ActionParsnip> mili: gnome is default installed in Ubuntu
[03:32] <ActionParsnip> crammer: http://forum.aircrack-ng.org/index.php?topic=12242.0
[03:33] <mili> ActionParsnip i assume hwcrypt is causing slowdowns or has compatibility problems and just needs disabled
[03:33] <ActionParsnip> mili: possibly, the fix is mentioned in a few forums
[03:34] <ActionParsnip> mili: reboot to test, if it's no good, just delete the conf file and reboot
[03:35] <grahamsa_> aberrant: i tried test -e
[03:35] <grahamsa_> doesn't work.. actionparsnip: cool
[03:35] <grahamsa_> i.e. if i get stdout
[03:35] <grahamsa_> it works
[03:35] <aberrant> grahamsa_: yes it does.
[03:35] <aberrant> grahamsa_: test -e <filename> ; echo $?

[03:38] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: Hey me again. I need help booting into linux with nouveau blacklisted again
[03:38] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: hold SHIFT at boot, remove:   quiet splash   and add:   nouveau.blacklist=1
=== christopher is now known as EmpyrealCookie
[03:39] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: hold Shift before grub loads? or after I select Ubuntu from grub?
[03:39] <warfar_> help i cant uninstall packages
[03:39] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: SHIFT makes Grub show up, you can then press E to (e)dit the kernel
[03:39] <ActionParsnip> warfar_: what are you trying to uninstall and how are you doing it?
[03:40] <grahamsa_> aberrant: doens't work for me
[03:40] <amu> hello  I want some  fantastic themes and wall papers for my ubuntu
[03:40] <aberrant> grahamsa_: it's a standard way of testing. what are you doing, and what are you getting?
[03:40] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: Okay, I pressed E, and I'm in the grub commands. I just delete quite splash and I put in nouveau.blacklist=1 in its place?
[03:40] <grahamsa_> test -e /bla/bla
[03:40] <grahamsa_> getting no output
[03:40] <hero616> Which key is <Primary>, I can't find it.
[03:40] <aberrant> grahamsa_: yes. then do an 'echo $?'
[03:41] <aberrant> grahamsa_: test -e /bla/bla; echo $?
[03:41] <hero616> Another name?
[03:41] <warfar_> http://pastebin.com/kjA82aWU
[03:41] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: yes, then hit ENTER to continue the boot
[03:41] <grahamsa_> oh aberrant: very nice :D
[03:42] <aberrant> grahamsa_: or, if you're going to do something with that file, test -e /bla/bla && cat /bla/bla - or whatever.
[03:42] <grahamsa_> ah yeah
[03:42] <grahamsa_> that is an awesome command
[03:42] <ActionParsnip> warfar_: line 44 is a massive clue
[03:42] <grahamsa_> i reckon i'll use that all the time
[03:42] <aberrant> grahamsa_: man test - lots of options.
[03:43] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: It said use Ctrl+x to boot, I did that and its booting now, hopefully it worked and won't freeze on me, installation went fine after I used the command
[03:43] <warfar_> how do i get R/W
[03:43] <aberrant> grahamsa_: test is invaluable if you're doing any sort of scripting. Also look at [ which is a synonym.
[03:43] <Sir_Fawnpug> Is there a way to chainload the liveCD from GRUB?
[03:43] <grahamsa_> abarrent: i been scripting tons of stuff. can't believe i've not come across it
[03:43] <aberrant> heh
[03:44] <ActionParsnip> warfar_: run:   sudo mount -o rw,remount /
[03:44] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: It just did it again, my mouse is frozen
[03:44] <ActionParsnip> warfar_: I assume you have only one partition not counting swap
[03:44] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: try the 2D session
[03:44] <warfar_> i have many but 1 hdd
[03:45] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: my computer auto logs in
[03:45] <aberrant> wow. us.archive.ubuntu.com is slow as heck right now. :(
[03:45] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: then press CTRL+ALT+F1, log in there and run:  killall -u $USER    then log in to the 2D session
[03:45] <ActionParsnip> aberrant: change source....
[03:46] <aberrant> ActionParsnip: been switching around but in the middle of a big apt-get, so can't :)
[03:46] <ActionParsnip> aberrant: when you can then :)
[03:46] <aberrant> yah
[03:46] <aberrant> ActionParsnip: any recommended?
[03:46] <ActionParsnip> aberrant: recommended what?
[03:46] <aberrant> ActionParsnip: sources besides us.archive?
[03:47] <ActionParsnip> aberrant: just change to a different one....
[03:47] <aberrant> is there a list somewhere?
[03:47] <felipe_Brz> compiz crashes everytime I use truecrypt to mount a volume... i run ubuntu 12.04... has anyone else had this happen to them?
[03:47] <ActionParsnip> aberrant: there is a function in software centre. I'd just remove the 'us.' from within sources.list to use the main server
[03:48] <ActionParsnip> felipe_Brz: is it ok in 2D session
[03:48] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: okay, I'm at the login screen. How do I change the session?
[03:48] <aberrant> ah.
[03:48] <aberrant> ok
[03:48] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: use the ubuntu icon near your username
[03:48] <felipe_Brz> ActionParsnip:  sorry, what do you mean by that? cli version?
[03:48] <warfar_> ActionParsnip, i'm getting the same error again
[03:49] <ActionParsnip> felipe_Brz: no, Use Unity2D, if it is ok there then you know that it is compiz causiung the issue as the 2D uses something else
[03:49] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: sorry to be that guy, but I don't see an ubuntu Icon anywhere.
[03:49] <ActionParsnip> warfar_: I suggest you boot to liveCD and fsck the partitiojn
[03:49] <nickgaw> Hi, Where in ubuntu server does ubuntu store the wireless network name and key so it connects to it upon boot?
[03:50] <warfar_> i'm kinda limited atm
[03:50] <acdcfan> hello, i have a question if this is the place to ask
[03:50] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: I see my name, under that is a pw box, then guest session, remote login and at the bottom in stays ubuntu 12.10
[03:50] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: http://software.opensuse.org/package/screenshot/lightdm.png   or the cog in thios picture, same thing
[03:51] <mili> ActionParsnip nope, no change
[03:51] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: the gear icon isn't next to my username.
[03:52] <mili> yet a speedtest just clocked 33.60Mb
[03:53] <acdcfan> i did a mount --bind in a users home directory to give them access to a folder on a different drive and while it lists fine over ssh, it doesn't list over vsftp. is there a vsftp setting i need to futz with? i didnt' see anything in the conf that looked promising
[03:54] <felipe_Brz> ActionParsnip:  hey now I've chosen ubuntu 2d on the main menu I've had no more crashes... thanks for helping.. so this means the culprit is indeed compiz?
[03:54] <nickgaw> when I installed ubuntu server my system has a 1 TB spining hard drive and  8 GB flash drive I installed ubuntu server to the flash portion and used the 1 TB as the home directories is this the best thing to do install the operating system on the flash portion of the drive?
[03:54] <ActionParsnip> felipe_Brz: yes, the 2D session doesn't use compiz. It also runs a whole lot faster :)
[03:54] <crammer> how do a reload a module
[03:55] <Muphrid> crammer: modprobe it
[03:55] <crammer> to make a device reload its drive, i use modprobe?
[03:55] <crammer> driver*
[03:55] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: is there a command line to make X boot into Unity 2d because I can't seem to get to the session selection via the login window
[03:55] <Dr_Willis> rmmod the modprobe
[03:55] <felipe_Brz> ActionParsnip:  i was about to say that... it doesn't look any different really. shouldn't it have one dimension less? hehe
[03:56] <ActionParsnip> felipe_Brz: just doesn't have the flashy animation rubbish
[03:56] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  you could edit the .dmrc to select the default desktop. You are not on 12.10 are you?
[03:56] <Muphrid> crammer: sudo modprobe modulename
[03:56] <xenome> is there any easy way to remove all ubuntu-desktop packages, I want to go back to CLI
[03:56] <Maverick_Hunter> dr_willis: I am
[03:56] <magik_> ActionParsnip, your still helping people? wow you were helping people when I left 4 hours ago lol
[03:56] <felipe_Brz> i see thanks for helping me and all the other people too ActionParsnip
[03:56] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: you can edit lightdm.conf and set it there. Look around the screen. You can change the session type
[03:56] <xenome> and don't want to reinstall or switch to ubuntu-server
[03:56] <daftykins> nickgaw: assuming Linux can't make use of SSD cacheing yeah
[03:56] <ActionParsnip> magik_: 12 hour nightshift is my secret.
[03:57] <magik_> ActionParsnip, haha I've had a few of them doing security I just sat on the computer all night bored lol
[03:57] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  there is no Unity 2d on 12.10
[03:58] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  compiz/unity is supposed to use some llvm (sp?) mode for limited hardware
[03:58] <mkquist> ..
[03:58] <Maverick_Hunter> dr_willis: God I hate Unity. I was just going to install gnome3 over it once I was fully logged in anyway
[03:59] <seednode> Eh, Gnome3 isn't much better imo
[03:59] <Dr_Willis> I have no real issues with Unity. G3 seems differnt but works decently well once you get the hang o it
[03:59] <Dr_Willis> I had more issues with the old gnome ;)
[04:00] <seednode> I don't have a dislike of Unity, per se; I just prefer many other DE/WM/plugins to it
[04:00] <Maverick_Hunter> dr_willis: agreed, I switched the XFCE and LXDE after my issues with gnome2 toward the end.
[04:00] <ActionParsnip> seednode: Unity is a shell.....
[04:00] <seednode> ActionParsnip, I think you get the point, given my multiple nouns there
[04:00] <netf0x> hi
[04:00] <ActionParsnip> seednode: indeed :)
[04:01] <seednode> Perhaps I should use the blanket term interfaces next time
[04:01] <seednode> Since people nitpick any of those terms
[04:01] <magik_> ActionParsnip, Is there any way I can test to make sure my SAMBA share is working properly from the local machine,  I can see it running but I dunno if it will allow connect.  I don't have another laptop to test it with right now.
[04:01] <seednode> GNOME is a desktop environment, Compiz is the compositor for it, and Unity is a plugin for Compiz
[04:01] <seednode> It's complicated
[04:01] <xenome> seednode: do you know how to completely remove all the unit/ubuntu-desktop packages
[04:02] <seednode> Though, since Compiz/Unity are included with GNOME, it can still be considered a DE
[04:02] <ActionParsnip> magik_: run:   smbtree
[04:02] <netf0x> jl
[04:02] <seednode> xenome, no, I personally do not; someone here certainly does, though.
[04:02] <seednode> I haven't actually used ubuntu for a while now; I just hang around to help with non-distro specific issues
[04:02] <ActionParsnip> seednode: its not included with gnome, its just installed by default in Ubuntu
[04:02] <ActionParsnip> seednode: you can run Gnome and run openbox as WM if you want
[04:02] <seednode> ActionParsnip: Once again, we can nitpick this all day
[04:02] <ActionParsnip> seednode: indeed
[04:02] <seednode> ActionParsnip, But my point was still fairly clear ^^
[04:03] <magik_> ActionParsnip, I need to sudo install smbclient  I forgot I uninstalled one sec
[04:03] <crammer> how do i tell which .ko file my usb wifi adapter is using
[04:04] <magik_> ActionParsnip, When I smbtree I got nothing poping up
[04:05] <magik_> ActionParsnip, It asked me for my password and then nothing happens.
[04:05] <Dr_Willis> ive noticed smbtree and findsmb  not working in recent disrtos
[04:06] <ActionParsnip> magik_: is samba running?
[04:06] <magik_> I'm using 12.10 64bit
[04:06] <magik_> ActionParsnip, yes both smbd and nmbd
[04:06] <ActionParsnip> crammer: sudo lshw -C network     the driver=   will give the name, you can then run:   sudo updatedb; locate drivername | grep ko
[04:08] <magik_> ActionParsnip, I did it again and got a return
[04:09] <Dr_Willis> linux/unix fundamentals.. if you use a command and it dosent print an error message.. then most likely It succeded. ;)
[04:10] <magik_> ActionParsnip, It told me //hostname hostname server (Samba,Ubuntu)
[04:10] <magik_> I'm sorry \\ instead of // bad habit of mine
[04:12] <magik_> Now the only way to test a connection would be with another computer?  Or is there a way I can do it localy
[04:13] <Maverick_Hunter> So I've decided to install gnome3 via cli and see if I can choose a session from there.
[04:14] <seednode> You'll need to either have a login manager thingy, or edit .xinitrc, IIRC
[04:18] <Dr_Willis> or edit the .dmrc
[04:18] <Dr_Willis> when i installed gnome3 it became the default for 'startx' for some reason
[04:18] <Dr_Willis> if you are intalling gnome3 may as well use gdm also.
[04:19] <seednode> Eh, I use LightDM, though I've heard it can have issues
[04:22] <I440r> ok i just installed ubuntu 12.whatever in a virtualbox vm. it runs about as fast as i can run going backwards through MUD.  no other vm on this machine runs this ssssslllllooooowwwww.  task 1: GET RID of unity and compiz.  i installed lxde. rebooted and... login brings me to unity, no options presented to select anything else
[04:23] <I440r> look in the system settings,, NOTHING to change default desktop
[04:23] <I440r> how do i switch to the lxde i just installed
[04:23] <I440r> and make IT the default so i can start purging the trash
[04:23] <daftykins> I440r: most moved to Linux Mint to escape the torture
[04:24] <I440r> i specifically chose ubuntu for a reason and this is in a vm
[04:24] <I440r> how do i make lxde THE de
[04:25] <ActionParsnip> I440r: the last session used is remembered for each user
[04:25] <I440r> great... how do i "Switch session"
[04:25] <I440r> because i cant find that either
[04:25] <I440r> lol
[04:25] <ActionParsnip> I440r: select it on the login screen
[04:25] <I440r> there is no option to select it
[04:25] <ActionParsnip> I440r: use the ubutu icon near your username
[04:25] <ActionParsnip> I440r: of course there is
[04:25] <I440r> and whats more to get back to the login screen i have to reboot because i cannot see a "logout" option anywhere
[04:26] <I440r> oh i KNOW its there, i just dont know where
[04:26] <Maverick_Hunter> I didn't see it in my login screen either.
[04:26] <ActionParsnip> I440r: are you using the unity session? If so then the logout is under the cog menu in the top right
[04:26] <I440r> oh yea
[04:26] <I440r> i did see that before
[04:26] <ActionParsnip> I440r: can you find an image online of what your login screen looks like
[04:27] <I440r> i doubt i could find an image of it but i can describe it. thers a little window with my full name and a Password entry field below. below that is guest session and remote login
[04:28] <I440r> and theres a little ubuntu wheel thing there i can click to select DE
[04:28] <BryanRuiz1> my once working internal laptop camera doesnt work anymore...  its possible it stopped working when i switched to kubuntu.. any thoughts?
[04:28] <I440r> awesome. nicely hidden
[04:29] <I440r> yea switched to lxde and typing doesnt take 3 seconds per character any more
[04:29] <seednode> Heh...
[04:30] <seednode> I use Openbox, haven't noticed any input lag since
[04:30] <I440r> on my host system which is gentoo i use windowmaker
[04:30] <ActionParsnip> seednode: gotta love *box
[04:30] <seednode> ActionParsnip: Yep. I use it on my '06 laptop, and it runs beautifully
[04:30] <I440r> *box are all forks and heavy modifications to windowmaker i believe.. blackbox was the first *box and it was a direct fork of wm
[04:31] <seednode> Though, the laptop has 4GB RAm, so it works well enough anyways
[04:31] <ActionParsnip> seednode: i'd always use it, no matter what spec
[04:32] <seednode> ActionParsnip: Well, when I'm going for absolute minimum resource usage, I use i3
[04:32] <I440r> i got a question. does ubuntu also store terminfo files INCORRECTLY in /lib/terminfo the same as debian?
[04:32] <I440r> because their rationalization for doing so is moronic.  "We want to be able to use terminals with /usr unmounted so we put terminfo in /lib/terminfo"
[04:32] <ActionParsnip> I440r: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbox says blackbox is written from the ground up
[04:32] <Dr_Willis> I think some of the *box wm's were total rewrites.
[04:33] <I440r> except you CANT unmount /usr
[04:33] <I440r> ActionParsnip, i believe the very first incantation of BB was a fork
[04:34] <ActionParsnip> I440r: fair
[04:34] <Flannel> I440r: justification for Ubuntu doing it is "Debian does it that way", as Ubuntu is a derivative of Debian.
[04:35] <I440r> is there a way to get synaptic to show ONLY currently installed packages?
[04:35] <I440r> Flannel, still a limp wristed reason.  putting terminfo in /lib is WRONG
[04:35] <I440r> but ubuntu's guilt is lesser than debians
[04:36] <I440r> how do i make synaptic package manager show only packages that are installed
[04:36] <I440r> nvm i found it lol
[04:37] <I440r> as you see... im an ubuntu pro!
[04:37] <I440r> :/
[04:37] <Sir_Fawnpug> What are my installation options when both the cd drive and PXE fail?
[04:37] <Maverick_Hunter> I'm still freezing up after about a minute after logging in!
[04:37] <sgtkilljoy> Sir_Fawnpug: usb?
[04:37] <ActionParsnip> I440r: why not use dpkg to shown installed packages rather than a GUI app :)
[04:37] <I440r> because i want to mark all packages i want removed then remove them and their deps all at once
[04:38] <I440r> not remove items one at a time
[04:38] <Sir_Fawnpug> sgtkilljoy, that may be all that's left to me. I was afraid of that, cause my big usb key seems to be missing
[04:38] <magik_> ActionParsnip, whats the command to do that just dpkg ?
[04:38] <ActionParsnip> magik_: dpkg -l | awk {'print $2'}
[04:38] <magik_> ActionParsnip, thanks that will come in handy
[04:38] <ActionParsnip> I440r: apt-get accepts multiple package names
[04:39] <ActionParsnip> I440r: eg:  sudo apt-get --purge remove firefox* thunderbird* gnomine gnome-mahjong empathy*      and so on
[04:39] <I440r> dpkg --remove-all-these-packages-and-their-dependancies  then carefully type out the exact names of over 400 packages on the same line then hit enter
[04:39] <ActionParsnip> I440r: if its that many then I'd be using minimal and build up
[04:40] <I440r> or. get a list in a gui, select one and mark it for complete removal...
[04:40] <I440r> i was exagerating for effect it will probably be 40 or 50 tho
[04:40] <magik_> lol
[04:41] <Dr_Willis> You can install with just a 1gb USB flash drive i belive..
[04:41] <Dr_Willis> 2gb may be a better one to try.
[04:42] <kslater> Does anyone else have issues with the weather indicator on 12.04?
[04:42] <kslater> I can't seem to add a location to it
[04:42] <Dr_Willis> kslater:  ive noticed that happens a lot.
[04:43] <Dr_Willis> saw it the othe day in 12.10 on gnome-shell also. Not sure if its a server issue.. or whats going on.
[04:43] <ActionParsnip> kslater: I reported a bug where the location set never completes
[04:43] <ActionParsnip> kslater: but its occuring in Raring
[04:44] <kslater> loads of hits on weather indicator location crash
[04:44] <RagnaRok__> where are the icons for the indicators in the panels stored?
[04:45] <Dr_Willis> part of the icon themes i thought.
[04:45] <ActionParsnip> kslater: https://launchpad.net/~atareao/+archive/atareao?field.series_filter=precise   I used that and installed my-weather-indicator
[04:46] <RagnaRok__> Dr_Willis : where would i find that  folder?
[04:46] <kslater> ActionParsnip: and it works?
[04:46] <r4y> I need some help. My other computer is having trouble, but I don't want to go into detail at all right now. Instead I want to bypass having to use the ide ports, cables, hard drive to narrow down those being the possible problem from any other possible problem(s)
[04:46] <r4y> Do I use this to test Ubuntu on a usb drive or is it just for installing Ubuntu?
[04:46] <r4y> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
[04:46] <RagnaRok__> nevermind i found it
[04:47] <RagnaRok__> thanks anyways :)
=== maequises is now known as maequise
[04:47] <magik_> r4y, I think you can boot ubuntu from the USB drive or install
[04:48] <r4y> I guess I should try, I can always try some other way once I've downloaded Ubuntu for this, TY
[04:48] <magik_> r4y, I've had good luck with a 2gb drive booting ubuntu and intalling it.
[04:49] <ActionParsnip> kslater: yeah, runs fine
[04:49] <Dr_Willis> RagnaRok__:  should be one for each icon theme you have installed,  try the locate command toi see where exactly they are
[04:50] <ActionParsnip> r4y: the USB stick will give an OS that runs in RAM
[04:50] <r4y> I've used Ubuntu from usb before but I used Ubuntu to put it onto a usb drive and because it say 2 GBs and installer, I wasn't and am not sure about it just being for just installing, but I might as well try
[04:50] <RagnaRok__> Dr_Willis : I found it in "/usr/share/icons" , thanks man
[04:51] <r4y> TY for answering, take care
[04:52] <kslater> ActionParsnip: there are some other indicators in there that look interesting
[04:55] <voly> hello
[04:55] <cfhowlett> voly greeting
[04:55] <magik_> voly, hello
[04:56] <Muphrid> Ahoy
[04:56] <voly> my ubuntu server have install
[04:56] <voly> and running well
[04:56] <magik_> voly, cool beans ;)
[04:56] <voly> how conect my server with usb modem???
[04:57] <cfhowlett> !modem
[04:57] <ubottu> You want to connect via dial-up? Read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DialupModemHowto - Also try disabling/removing KNetworkManager if KDE applications cannot connect using dial-up
[04:57] <voly> is't posible for my server bro?
[04:59] <magik_> voly, I'm sure it's possible,  But I am unfamiliar with usb modems in ubuntu
[05:00] <voly> ok magik
[05:00] <voly> thanks to ubottu for u link
[05:00] <voly> i try to learn first
[05:01] <magik_> also voly check http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=883852 it talks about usb modems in ubuntu
[05:04] <gpled> lost my ethernet device.  if i boot up from live cd, it works. any help?
[05:05] <magik_> gpled, If nobody else here has any suggestions,  I would suggest backing up your data and reinstalling
[05:06] <cfhowlett> gpled: had something similar happen to me.  Discovered that if I turned off the wireless connection in Network Manager, the wired connection auto-connected properly
[05:07] <cfhowlett> gpled: reinstallation isn't called for.  This is more a matter of configuring your connection
[05:07] <tekkbuzz> Whenever I use apt-get I usually get this WARNING: The following packages cannot be authenticated! Install these packages without verification [y/N]? Anyone know how to fix this?
[05:07] <JoeJulian> I'm trying to make a service start after the lvm volume it needs is mounted but it keeps starting before. Any upstart experts around?
[05:07] <alexhairyman> Good night
[05:08] <gpled> ifconfig only shows lo device
[05:08] <sgtkilljoy> tekkbuzz: sudo apt-get update
[05:08] <cfhowlett> tekkbuzz: the package maintainers need to renew their certificates/approvals/credentials. You CAN install anyway ...
[05:08] <jomaxro> Is the ubuntu 12.10 iso usb drive bootable?
[05:08] <tekkbuzz> sgtkilljoy, done that.
[05:08] <gpled> how can i manually get to my Network Manager?
[05:08] <cfhowlett> jomaxro: of course
[05:09] <jomaxro> is there an easy way to flash it onto a drive?
[05:09] <jomaxro> or can I just copy the files extracted from the iso?
[05:09] <cfhowlett> jomaxro: unetboootin or the default startup-disk-creator
[05:09] <tekkbuzz> cfhowlett, thanks, I thought there was a key to install or something.
[05:09] <jomaxro> windows, sorry
[05:09] <jomaxro> installing ubuntu
[05:09] <jomaxro> new hard drive
[05:10] <cfhowlett> tekkbuzz: startupdiskcreator will configure the usb for booting the iso
[05:10] <sgtkilljoy> jomaxro: unetbootin, is available for windows
[05:10] <magik_> I think you have to write the image to the usb drive I used a program in windows to make the usb drive called Universal USB installer
[05:10] <jomaxro> cool, googleing
[05:17] <Sir_Fawnpug> So I'd like to chainload smartbootmanager on the installation CD cause I have GRUB, but for some bizarre reason I can't boot from the CD itself
[05:17] <Bsims> is there a easy way to boot a vm as a live usb?
[05:17] <Sir_Fawnpug> I was wondering if I need the memdisk module or if I'm cool without it
[05:17] <Bsims> Sir_Fawnpug: I dunno never used either
[05:17] <gpled> where do modules live?
[05:17] <Bsims> gpled: for kernel?
[05:17] <Sir_Fawnpug> gpled, I believe /usr/lib now
[05:18] <Sir_Fawnpug> Used to be /lib
[05:18] <Sir_Fawnpug> Although that might have been an ArchLinux change and not something that happened globally
[05:18] <gpled> Bsims: eth0 type
[05:18] <coolBunny> request help from anyone who has initiated their kids into ubuntu/linux. how did you start? at what age?
[05:18] <ActionParsnip> gpled: /lib/modules/`uname -r`
[05:19] <coolBunny> s/help/opinion
[05:19] <sgtkilljoy> cool_code: show them the computer, they will work it out :)
[05:19] <Bsims> gpled: I beleve /usr/lib or /lib
[05:19] <ActionParsnip> Bsims: try:  sudo updatedb; locate psmouse | grep ko
[05:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> coolBunny, really any age should be fine.
[05:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> Ubuntu is the perfect distro to get them started, cause it's relatively easy to set up and there are tons of window managers in apt if unity isn't to their liking
[05:20] <coolBunny> @sgt and Sir: thanks. my older one is 9. is this the right age to get her think beyond windoze?
[05:21] <ActionParsnip> coolBunny: just plonk them in front of it. Some schools use Ubuntu as their desktop
[05:21] <rethaw> test
[05:21] <Sir_Fawnpug> coolBunny, well I started using DOS when I was 5 or 6, I think it'll be fine
[05:21] <gpled> coolBunny: do they want to learn computers, or just use them?
[05:21] <gnat_> Unity is bad imo.  I've but cinnamon on my ubuntu/debian distros.
[05:21] <cfhowlett> cool_code: consider installing the edubuntu packages as well.  Fun education games
[05:21] <gnat_> I've put cinnamon*
[05:21] <coolBunny> her school has made her believe that micro$oft rules the world. it is not just using computers. i want them to learn it like get started with os, programs, etc
[05:21] <ActionParsnip> gnat_: you don't have to use Unity. That's the beauty of the OS
[05:22] <Sir_Fawnpug> And DOS definitely had more of a learning curve
[05:22] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: specially with himem.sys and so forth ;)
[05:22] <coolBunny> @Sir: that is very reassuring (5/6 years). i think i got my answer !
[05:22] <Sir_Fawnpug> ActionParsnip, oh god, don't remind me.
[05:22] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: 'I need 20k more..wait..I have doskey running'
[05:22] <gnat_> I know.  I put Cinnamon on my ubuntu.  Ubuntu has much better out-of-the-box wireless support than Debian, only real reason I prefer it.
[05:23] <gpled> coolBunny:  the kids have to want to lean the computers.  else they will not care.  cant force them to care
[05:23] <Sir_Fawnpug> gpled raises a good point. That's about the way it is with anything you're trying to get a kid interested in.
[05:24] <coolBunny> @gpled: you have a point. yes, i want them to have fun. maybe i will let them browse to some princess sites to let them know that there are other ways to get things done.
[05:24] <Sir_Fawnpug> I mean I guess the real challenge is to present it to them in such a way that they want to explore on their own.
[05:24]  * Bsims laughs my first computer was a Tandy TRS-80 with a .9mhz cpu and 14K of ram
[05:24] <gpled> fist time most people who where into computer saw linux, they got it. and wanted to know everything they could about it.
[05:25] <Sir_Fawnpug> I saw a Tandy Store around here the other day.
[05:25] <Bsims> <--- used to record programs on audio cassette and was glad to be able to
[05:25] <cfhowlett> coolBunny: consider also: do they want to learn *computers* or USE *computers*.  2 different goals/approaches.  DOING coolstufff with the computer usually has more appeal for youngsters ...
[05:25] <coolBunny> we don't have tablets at home (and i would like to remain that way)
[05:25]  * ActionParsnip had a Toshiba MSX with 64k RAM
[05:25] <gpled> i love networking, but can not find other normal people who love it
[05:25] <Sir_Fawnpug> ActionParsnip, did you used to live in Japan?
[05:25] <coolBunny> @cfhowlett: yes, i want them to produce something, not just consume info
[05:26] <mili> ActionParsnip was there any other suggestion on the wifi issue?  where it's kinda burping, halting, stays connected but seems slow as heck contacting sites etc?  i ran pings against some major sites and there didn't seem to be any lag there but i should let one run for a while
[05:26] <Sir_Fawnpug> I vaguely remember MSX being something that was being pushed hard in Asia a couple of decades ago
[05:26] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: UK, no idea how we got that thing
[05:26] <cfhowlett> coolBunny: give me a minute.  I've got a very nice tutorial for inscape that was used to introduce vector graphics to girl scouts ....
[05:26] <Sir_Fawnpug> ActionParsnip, I suppose the same way we got the C64
[05:26] <ActionParsnip> mili: if you run:  echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null       does it work better?
[05:27] <coolBunny> thanks howlett
[05:27] <Sir_Fawnpug> Although the C64 did sell remarkably well in the US
[05:27] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: ahhh we went the spectrum 128K + 2 route
[05:27] <mili> i set the wifi to use dhcp (address only) and set dns to both of google's public servers a while back.  no difference
[05:27] <mili> but then again i did set it in the connection manager or whatever, not directly in resolv.conf
[05:27] <cfhowlett> coolBunny: introduction to inkscape for middle schoolers   http://linuxgrrl.com/learn/Introduction_To_Inkscape
[05:28] <Sir_Fawnpug> I remember reading an artcle the other day that the ZX spectrum would've never passed current UK eletrical regulations
[05:28] <Sir_Fawnpug> Something about it putting out too much RF noise.
[05:28]  * coolBunny thanks cfhowlett !
[05:28] <KaRmA> I have a dedicated server in (france on ovh network, I'm in the U.S. most of the time I get full bandwidth from the server through ftp but during some hours, usually 8pm to whenver EST the ftp speed slows to a crawl. this has nothing to do with my server config does it?
[05:28] <Sir_Fawnpug> And that apparently the UK equivalent of the FCC would've rejected it in modern times.
[05:28] <mcf3782> I have a recently installed 32-bit Intel version of 12.04 LTS..  All of the documentation I've been able to find; I have interpreted as showing that network interface configuration is controlled by /etc/network/interfaces.   My box *IS* getting a DHCP assigned IPv4 address on eth0 (the only ethernet interface in the box); but there is no mention of eth0 in /etc/network/interfaces.
[05:28] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: haha explains a lot ;)
[05:28] <cfhowlett> coolBunny: also, get the BigBuckBunny movie!  all of the materials for the film are available as well.
[05:29] <KaRmA> mcf3782, are you using 'network manager'
[05:29] <mcf3782> I can't figure out how the interface is getting configured.
=== leohxj is now known as aaa
[05:29] <coolBunny> huh?
[05:29] <mcf3782> KaRmA - is that installed by default?
[05:29] <KaRmA> mcf3782, pretty sure it is, it is like an applet that controls networks/wifi
[05:29] <mcf3782> I didn't intentionally install anything called 'network manager'
=== aaa is now known as leohxj11233
[05:29] <cfhowlett> coolBunny: blender movie?  Big Buck Bunny?  www.bigbuckbunny.org

[05:30] <coolBunny> wow cfhowlett, i will check it out. thanks a tonne
[05:31] <mcf3782> I'm not in the same building with the machine any longer, so I don't have access to the console/GUI.   Can someone suggest where I can look for a config file?
[05:31]  * coolBunny is off to check the big buck bunny site :>
[05:31] <KaRmA> mcf3782, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager
[05:34] <mcf3782> KaRmA - I've read that page several times today. :)   On my system, there is no mention of 'eth0' in any of the files described on that NetworkManager documentation page.

[05:35] <Guest16300> can anyone tell me how to figure out stable kernel version?
[05:36] <Guest16300> ?
[05:36] <ActionParsnip> Guest16300: www.kernel.org will tell you
[05:36] <mikehaas763> Is there somewhere on the interwebs where I can check when a specific version of a package was released by Ubuntu?
[05:36] <KaRmA> mcf3782, wicd ?

[05:36] <mikehaas763> *released to the repos
[05:36] <mikehaas763> ActionParsnip, thanks
[05:36] <mcf3782> wicd?
[05:36] <Guest16300> ActionParsnip : if they don't say stable, which means unstable?
[05:36] <ElectricPrism> what happened to the #ElementaryOS channel? did it change?
[05:37] <KaRmA> mcf3782, another network control daemon
[05:37] <Guest16300> ActionParsnip : like kernel 3.6.0 ?
[05:37] <mcf3782> nothing running with that name.
[05:38] <gpled> woot! go with your gut

[05:41] <KaRmA> I have a dedicated server in (france on ovh network, I'm in the U.S. most of the time I get full bandwidth from the server through ftp but during some hours, usually 8pm to whenver EST the ftp speed slows to a crawl. this has nothing to do with my server config does it?
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> Guest16300: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[05:42] <Guest16300> ActionParsnip, Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 \n \l
[05:42] <mcf3782> KaRmA - that doesn't sound like a situation that would be a server config issue to me. Sounds like a network issue somewhere along the path.
[05:43] <ActionParsnip> Guest16300: then its debian, ask in #debian
[05:43] <Guest16300> ok
[05:43] <Guest16300> thanks
[05:43] <KaRmA> mcf3782, yea, it is just weird because it works at my fully line speed some times and I have no issues running a trace route.
[05:44] <keith_> KaRmA: do you also notice a change in ping times right about then as well?
[05:44] <KaRmA> keith_, haven't noticed too much
[05:44] <tony1> when i try to run ant . the out put is'' Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!'' plz help me
[05:45] <somsip> tony1: create a build file. You seem to be asking a lot of very basic questions.
[05:45] <keith_> If the ping time is going up as your connection speed slows, it's probably a bandwidth issue.
[05:46] <KaRmA> keith_, I think the issue must be on their end since I can still download stuff at full speed when my ftp box is slow, just not from that box :-\
[05:46] <keith_> yep... 8pm EST is noon GMT, no?
[05:47] <KaRmA> keith_, not sure
[05:48] <KaRmA> keith_, right now it is 5:47 gmt
[05:48] <KaRmA> keith_, am
[05:48] <ActionParsnip> tony1: http://ant.apache.org/manual/install.html
[05:48] <KaRmA> keith_, and it is full speed at the moment, was slow closer to 8pm est or 1 am gmt
[05:48] <somsip> KaRmA: EDT is 1:58am
[05:48] <ActionParsnip> tony1: a simple websearch would show that....
[05:48] <keith_> More network traffic during peak periods can slow you way down, especially on a transcontinental wire. I'd suspect local bandwidth issues at the server end.
[05:49] <KaRmA> keith_, yea they keep trying to say it is on my end, but I get my full line speed to cdimage.debian.org which is in sweden, don't think it is on ovh either. even when my ovh box is super slow
[05:50] <KaRmA> I have a 75 to 85 mbps connection so I get around 10 MB/s when it is working right
[05:50] <KaRmA> 1MB/S or less when it isn't
[05:50] <keith_> KaRmA, that's why you should ping the route. It could also be a local router as well - 8pm local is also prime time.
[05:50] <ActionParsnip> tony1: http://www.howtoforge.com/android-buildfile-build.xml-does-not-exist
[05:51] <KaRmA> keith_, yea but like I said I have 0 issues downloading from anywhere else. and I am on Fiber optic so it isn't bandwidth share with my neighbors
[05:51] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: you can add lines in /etc/sysctl.conf to use more RAM as cache (makes network smoother)
[05:51] <ActionParsnip> tony1: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=908002
[05:52] <keith_> lol - still.... ping the route to see where the hold up is. It's the only way to know for sure.
[05:52] <KaRmA> keith_, so the highest ping is the hold up i'd guess
[05:52] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1505900/   add that to the file, then run:  sudo sysctrl -p
[05:52] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, yea but I doubt that would help since it works at full speed for hours at a time
[05:53] <keith_> Yep - and you want to do it over time as well. Sometimes servers get flaky and they're switched out. You want to also pay attention to the route IP addys
[05:54] <KaRmA> keith_, right now (it seems to be working fine) my highest ping is 146 MS to the server it's self
[05:54] <cfhowlett> CHALLENGE: enable YT ... from China.  Rulz: via ubuntu, no VPM.  Result: partial success.  After editing my DNS /hosts file, I can see YT, I can see the placeholder for videos.  BUT I cannot see actual video content.  So close ...  Suggestions?  What did I miss?  FWIW, this method fully enabled FB.
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> cfhowlett: what is yt?
[05:56] <keith_> KaRmA, you'll need to do some googling, but there was a windows program called PingPlotter that I used to use whenever I had net speed issues. Linux doesn't have one, AFAIK, but there are some great articles for checking your hops.
[05:56] <tony1>  i would like to thanks  all of you
[05:56] <daftykins> cfhowlett: youtube probably
[05:57] <daftykins> oops
[05:57] <daftykins> ActionParsnip: youtube probably
[05:57] <ActionParsnip> ;)
[05:57] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, net.core.rmem_default = 524288 = in Kb ?
[05:57] <daftykins> it's late, that's my excuse ;)
[05:57] <ActionParsnip> cfhowlett: does minitube work?
[05:57] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: works here
[05:57] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, I mean are those numbers ram in KB ?
[05:58] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: i belive its bytes
[05:59] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: not sure tbh
[05:59] <keith_> KaRmA - those are KB. Not bad, but you can boost that to your mem size if you want.
[05:59] <KaRmA> keith_, wouldn't that cause some type of issue
[05:59] <keith_> nope - it'll get swapped out if another app needs space
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[06:00] <KaRmA> keith ActionParsnip what makes no sense to me, is that my box is on ovh. but if i go to 'proof.ovh.net/files' and download a file using wget I get terrible speeds even when my box is giving me line speed bandwidth to my home box makes no sense to me
[06:00] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: i'd use those for now, see how it rolls
[06:01] <keith_> KaRmA - different routes?
[06:02] <KaRmA> keith_, must be let me check
[06:02] <KaRmA> * * * indicates a failure right ?
[06:03] <keith_> nope - just unresolved
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: I'm getting 5.4Mb / sec using the 1gb.dat file from that page (i believe that's my max
[06:03] <KaRmA> well my linux box on ovh is only 13 hops.... proof.ovh.net is 30 hops with a bunch of unresolvd
[06:03] <Burnt_Reynolds> can anyone help me out with problems im having running startx
[06:03] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, where are you located ?
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: UK
[06:03] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, i'm on the other side of the pond
[06:04] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: 5.4Mb/sec isn't shabby at all :)
[06:05] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, I get 9.5/10 MB/s when it is working right for me
[06:05] <KaRmA> 75-85 mbps
[06:06] <mysteriousdarren> I'm proud to be a longtime linux user, even more so when only windows production machine has got a virus today.
[06:07] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: i'm not on anything like that, i believe that maxed my pipe out
[06:07] <keith_> OK KaRmA - I just ran a good long ping on proof.ovh.net. I get fairly consistent 130 ms pings - but occasionally jumps to over a sec.
[06:07] <KaRmA> problem is I can't afford any USA based dedi server
[06:07] <KaRmA> I mean i'm paying $20 for the ovh one and when it works it is fantastic
[06:08] <KaRmA> but i've about had it
[06:08] <I440r> what package is it that does the gdmish thing in ubuntu, i want to remove it. i want to boot straight to terminal ONLY.  startx to launch x
[06:08] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, that sysctl.conf appears to not change my connection at all from what I can tell
[06:08] <KaRmA> I440r, lightdm
[06:09] <I440r> aha ty
[06:10] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, keith_
[06:10] <KaRmA> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1505924/
[06:10] <KaRmA> why do I have so many unresovled lol
[06:11] <keith_> KaRma - those are usually in-house hops from one internal server to another
[06:12] <KaRmA> keith_, also it appears to go to france, and then back to ny/nj !
[06:12] <KaRmA> wtf ?
[06:12] <KaRmA> and back to france again ~_~
[06:13] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: does it always take that route?
[06:14] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, let me see
[06:16] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, it appears so
[06:16] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: then maybe there is a routing issue at the hop above, or some work is taking place
[06:17] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, which hop ?
[06:17] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, on my end or theirs lol
[06:18] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: nyk-1-6k.ny.us  maybe
[06:19] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, well my actual server follows a different route but I have the same issue
[06:19] <sara_ubuntu_girl> hello room

[06:21] <frozenlock> Well... I think I finally made it: I broke something. -_-
[06:21] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, I see nothing about virginia in my traceroute ?
[06:22] <Muphrid> frozenlock: I just did rm /usr/bin* a few hours ago by mistake and had to reinstall....what was your problem?
[06:22] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: 216.6.87.10

[06:22] <frozenlock> I recompiled xpad.c using this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xbox360Controller#Troubleshooting (with a newer xpad version), but now I don't even see my usb device in jstest :(
[06:23] <Maverick_Hunter> I'm trying to install the NVIDIA driver via CLI, I have it downloaded but when I try to run it, it says I can't do it while X is running. How do I kill X?
[06:23] <frozenlock> In fact I don't see it in /dev/input/js* at all
[06:23] <Abhijit> hi. how can I know programmatically which graphics driver is currently in use? OR which graphic drivers are installed and working in the system? ubuntu 12.04
[06:23] <Abhijit> help please
[06:24] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, Im probably blind but I don't see that in the traceroute
[06:24] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: reboot and use root recovery console. Why not use the packaged driver
[06:24] <keith_> KaRmA: I go through VA in my route as well. I'm seeing shifts in ping times from nyk-106k.ny.us, which is telling me they may be having a server issue. It's the last hop before it goes transcontinental - so it's on "our"end.
[06:24] <sara_ubuntu_girl> hi cfhowlett
[06:24] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: line 10!
[06:24] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: I couldn't log in via GUI long enough to install any driver at all, so I just found the URL do it and and used wget to download it
[06:24] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: the line before the french ones...
[06:25] <Muphrid> Abhijit: lspci -v | grep -A 10 VGA\ Compatible
[06:25] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: then install the package using apt-get from the same place you used wget....
[06:25] <KaRmA> keith_, so it will likely be resolved eventually then
[06:25] <Muphrid> i mean, only VGA
[06:26] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: how do I find the package name?
[06:26] <keith_> KaRmA, usually within 24 hours.
[06:26] <keith_> but I've seen it go quite a bit longer too
[06:26] <KaRmA> keith_, it has been a few days O_O
[06:26] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[06:26] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: then reboot, see if updates get you a desktop
[06:26] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: if not, run:   sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[06:27] <Maverick_Hunter> the problem is the desktop freezes due to my NVIDIA card
[06:27] <KaRmA> keith_, I never had an issue for a whole month then it just started happening
[06:27] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: its probably scheduled
[06:27] <sara_ubuntu_girl> ActionParsnip hi hope u r well, i had 11.10 and 10.04 side by side ,i lost my ubuntu 10.04 installation after grub auto update , i tried both update-grub and update-grub2 but it 10.04 installation is gone only one installation shown
[06:28] <keith_> Yeah - what happens sometimes is a LOT of redundant server swaps - as one gets plowed under, another one jumps in. You might drop an email to the admin and see if they're aware of that kind of thing.... or you can traceroute and collect your own info...
[06:29] <Muphrid> sara_ubuntu_girl: check the menuentries in /boot/grub/grub.cfg and see if both are there
[06:29] <KaRmA> keith_, which admin ? I emailed my server provider they said it was on my  end, apparently they might be right although it isn't my actual ISP from the looks of it
[06:29] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: Thank you, yet AGAIN today.
[06:29] <sara_ubuntu_girl> Muphrid i checked it is not there , thanks ,,,any other troubleshooting steps?
[06:29] <keith_> but, if you're getting consistent results domestically in hops that don't go near that server, then there isn't much you can do but wait it out
[06:30] <Abhijit> Muphrid, outputs nothing in two different computers
[06:30] <KaRmA> keith_, maybe it is scheduled work, since during the day my time it is perfectly fine.
[06:30] <Muphrid> Abhijit: which did you try? i made a typo, it is not "Compatible" but compatible, or you can remove it and leave only VGA
[06:31] <keith_> possible... but more likely to be poor bandwidth tuning which causes the server swaps
[06:31] <KaRmA> sara_ubuntu_girl, does the partition exist with all the files on it still ?
[06:31] <KaRmA> keith_, maybe but it was fine for over a month, not one issue.
[06:31] <Abhijit> Muphrid, removing 'Combatible' gives info about the presnet physical graphics card. I need the info about the graphics card in use.
[06:31] <Abhijit> Muphrid, removing 'Combatible' gives info about the presnet physical graphics card. I need the info about the graphics card DRIVER in use.
[06:31] <keith_> well - that's just how electronic problems present themselves, right?
[06:32] <Muphrid> Abhijit: those in use should have a module loaded, or do all of them have a module loaded?
[06:32] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: np dude
[06:33] <KaRmA> keith_, true it is driving me nucking futs
[06:33] <Abhijit> Muphrid, how to list all of kernel modules?
[06:33] <Muphrid> the last lines say which driver is in use
[06:33] <Muphrid> Abhijit: lsmod
[06:33] <KaRmA> Abhijit, and you can use lsmod | grep 'module name'    without the 's to find a certain one if it is loaded or not
[06:34] <Muphrid> Abhijit: but in lspci you should see a line "kernel driver in use: "
[06:34] <keith_> KaRmA - been there, done that, got a signed autograph and a t-shirt...
[06:34] <KaRmA> keith_, lol
[06:34] <Abhijit> Muphrid, oh yes right. that helped. thanks.
[06:34] <Abhijit> KaRmA, thanks.
[06:35] <KaRmA> keith_, first it was a failing sd card in my phone. that was slowly going bad causing all kinds of problems took forever for it to finally die and no s.m.a.r.t on sd cards so I had no idea the issue, now this bull shit

[07:01] <Abhijit> Muphrid, to get only last line
[07:01] <PeTaz> +
[07:01] <kubanc> hellow! Any idea how can i add splashtop streamet to startup applications?
[07:01] <Muphrid> actually tail -n -1
[07:02] <I440r> so how was i SUPPOSED to install the guest additions. i looked in synaptic and there is no package for the additions
[07:02] <ActionParsnip> troop: no need for the quotes
[07:02] <sabgenton> whats the explination for recommending 32 bit ubuntu now  (link?)
[07:02] <Abhijit> Muphrid, -2 worked
[07:02] <klasa1b10> siema nooby
[07:02] <sabgenton> !64
[07:02] <Muphrid> Ok
[07:02] <ubottu> AMD64 and Intel 64 are fully supported architectures on Ubuntu. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions#AMD64_Processors and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64 for more information.
[07:03] <cfhowlett> I440r: virtualbox guest additions is offered by VBox and will not appear in synaptic's menu.
[07:03] <I440r> cfhowlett, i RAN the additions supplied by vbox. they are not working... or ubuntu isnt working
[07:04] <I440r> no mouse integration. no video modes other than  the 100x200 or what ever this postage stamp is
[07:04] <sabgenton> No answer from that
[07:05] <troop> yes i did!
[07:05] <I440r> also. i do not believe my default shell is bash because tab completion is also NOT working reliably
[07:06] <I440r> but when i type "bash" in what ever shell im in tab completion mysteriously starts working just fine
[07:07] <kubanc> hellow! where can i look what command is using ubuntu luncher for starting applications?
[07:09] <cfhowlett> cfhowlett: what feedback did you get?
[07:10] <I440r> ok so nobody can help get these additions to work?
[07:10] <daftykins> I440r: just a guess, but perhaps you want a virtualbox support channel
[07:10] <sabgenton> Doesn't seem to be any reason not to go 64 unless you are so non-tecy you don't know if you processor is  64 capable
[07:10] <I440r> i dont think the additions are what is broken
[07:11] <daftykins> sabgenton: but of course someone friendly like you would help someone find out, wouldn't you? ;)
[07:11] <sabgenton> offcourse :)
[07:11] <daftykins> :D
[07:11] <sabgenton> daftykins: I just which there was a page some ware on ubuntu.com saying why only 32 bit desktop iso is recommended
[07:13] <cfhowlett> I440r: you DID install dkms before attempting guest additions?
[07:13] <sabgenton> daftykins: if I had no doubt I would have to help someone find out I would just tell them straight
[07:13] <sabgenton> wouldn't**
[07:14] <daftykins> i hear issues every now and then, probably stuff normal users are unlikely to see though
[07:14] <I440r> cfhowlett, what is dkms and where is the rtfm telling me i had to do so because the 3 different pages i looked at on how to get these additions installed into ubuntu 12 said NOTHING about any dkms
[07:15] <cfhowlett> I440r: lots of folks having this issue.  I assume ubuntu 12.10?
[07:15] <I440r> yea
[07:15] <daftykins> http://www.sysprobs.com/latest-ubuntu-12-10-on-virtualbox-4-2-installed-guest-additions
[07:15] <daftykins> sudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose-guest-utils
[07:15] <I440r> cfhowlet i installed and then reinstalled the additions. im rebooting now to test. easiest lazy bum way to do so :)
[07:16] <daftykins> that installed dkms in that guide
[07:16] <klasa1b10> siema nooby co walicie konbia?
[07:16] <cfhowlett> I440r: ok
[07:16] <daftykins> that was the first google result for me

[07:16] <klasa1b10> cfhowlett powiedz jak bedzie koniec

[07:26] <I440r> installed it earlier when you mentioned it
[07:26] <cfhowlett> I440r: and you rebooted?
[07:26] <stercor> Nice diagnosis.  How do I fix it?
[07:26] <I440r> after installing dkms?
[07:26] <I440r> i think so. maybe not. let me try that
[07:26] <cfhowlett> I440r: yes.
[07:26] <Hrakleaz> good morning
[07:26] <cfhowlett> Hrakleaz: greetings
[07:26] <Maverick_Hunter> Dr_Willis: I didn't see what you said before xserver, do you have any idea how I can install the driver and get my shit working correctly?
[07:27] <Dr_Willis> stercor:  try the xscreensaver(s) package
[07:27] <I440r> the vm boots fast so. no problem
[07:27] <Hrakleaz> I installed ubuntu 12.10 at my laptop using windows installer
[07:27] <Hrakleaz> i have windows 32 bit
[07:27] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  all i ever do for nvidia is install nvidia-current
[07:27] <Hrakleaz> but the windows installer choose to install ubuntu64 bit
[07:27] <Hrakleaz> is this wrong or its ok ?
[07:27] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  sounds more like its installed but crashing.
[07:27] <Maverick_Hunter> Dr_Willis: I have Nvidia-current installed, and its still not making a difference
[07:28] <Maverick_Hunter> Dr_Willis: I also have the .run driver FROM Nvidia, but when i try and run it it says I have Xserver running and won't install
[07:28] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  so theres some deeper issues going on. You could try a simple 'startx' from the console (stop lightdm)  and look for any error messages
[07:28] <stercor> I thought that meant that I couldn't install it...
[07:28] <sgtkilljoy> Hrakleaz: do u have a 64bit processor
[07:28] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  because you stop lightdm and X befor using the .run driver.
[07:28] <Hrakleaz> i think its dual core 32 bit
[07:28] <keith_> Maverick_Hunter: I had the same type of nvidia issues. The new drivers fixed it up - I use the experimental on my GTX 650ti
[07:28] <Dr_Willis> Maverick_Hunter:  and i imagine the .run driver will just make things worse.. and is not really supported by this channel
[07:28] <KM0201> is there such a thing?
[07:28] <sgtkilljoy> Hrakleaz: what processor?
[07:28] <Hrakleaz> intel
[07:28] <Hrakleaz> i dont remember anything right now
[07:28] <KM0201> lol
[07:29] <Maverick_Hunter> Dr_Willis: So what do you suggest?
[07:29] <Hrakleaz> im away from my laptop sosz
[07:29] <Dr_Willis> Intel makes a lot of differnt processors. :)
[07:29] <sgtkilljoy> KM0201: not that im aware of
[07:29] <Hrakleaz> intel dual core i think
[07:29] <Hrakleaz> i buy my laptop with default windows 32 bit
[07:29] <KM0201> i love awesome answers... "What kind of laptop".. "Intel".. like they only make one processor
[07:29] <Hrakleaz> windows 7
[07:29] <keith_> Maverick_Hunter: if I might ask, how long has it been since you took the card out and blew out all the dust?
[07:30] <sgtkilljoy> Hrakleaz: in windows go to..........umm.......... 1 sec
[07:30] <ogist> hello
[07:30] <Hrakleaz> Yeah, the default os for my laptop is win 7 32 bit ... and the proseccor is dual core i think 32
[07:30] <Maverick_Hunter> well, case is open on one side and  just put the system together maybe a month ago
[07:30] <Hrakleaz> i dont if im wrong, cause the window install choose to instaal ubuntu 64
[07:30] <keith_> I had serious overheating problems on my GPU
[07:31] <ogist> I am using wine on Ubuntu and I am playing quake2 on it, but when I try to switch to OpenGL mode, it crashes. Can anyone help me?
[07:31] <Maverick_Hunter> keith_: my GPU runs at about 60 degrees F
[07:31] <KM0201> Hrakleaz: then it's a 64bit proc.
[07:31] <sgtkilljoy> Hrakleaz: right click computer go proprieties
[07:31] <namespace> There appears to be a .gpg to verify the integrity of the md5sums in the install images directory, where are the corresponding public keys hosted?
[07:31] <Hrakleaz> sgtkilljoy im away from laptop right now :/
[07:31] <keith_> all the time?
[07:31] <Dr_Willis> ogist:  theres linux native ports of quake1 2 and 3 i belive
[07:31] <I440r> well reboot and reinstall additons TOTALLY hozed my ubuntu. when i try login with my name "mark4" i get ^[m^[a^[r^[k.... etc
[07:31] <Hrakleaz> anyway i will check it later thx
[07:31] <cfhowlett> Hrakleaz: have you booted the ubuntu side ...
[07:32] <Dr_Willis>  ^[ = the escape key  I belive.
[07:32] <cfhowlett> I440r: try logging in as guest
[07:32] <I440r> ok all i had to do was type xxyyzz and sit and wait for the login to time out and now im logged in
[07:32] <Hrakleaz> the ubuntu side works perfect
[07:32] <Hrakleaz> no problem at the installation
[07:32] <Hrakleaz> and so far
[07:32] <I440r> i dont have a guest account. i dont use lightdm its uninstalled
[07:32] <sgtkilljoy> Hrakleaz: just go with it, if its 32bit processor it simply wont install, duel core = 64bit
[07:32] <Hrakleaz> but it lags sometimes
[07:32] <I440r> im at a console login
[07:32] <keith_> Maveric_Hunter: you don't have a gt 9x00 type of card in there, do you?
[07:32] <Hrakleaz> its dual core for sure
[07:32] <I440r> still no active additions
[07:32] <I440r> awesome
[07:32] <cfhowlett> Hrakleaz: so apparently your system can run 64 bit.  No harm, no foul.
[07:32] <Maverick_Hunter> keith_: its a 8600 GT
[07:33] <Hrakleaz> but why i have windows 7 32 bit as a default
[07:33] <Hrakleaz> ?
[07:33] <Hrakleaz> its a mistake for the company
[07:33] <Hrakleaz> ?
[07:33] <cfhowlett> Hrakleaz: ask in ##windows.  not supported here.
[07:34] <sgtkilljoy> Hrakleaz: windows......???? dont know
[07:34] <keith_> Maveric_Hunter, that may be your problem.... I couldn't keep that style GPU  in my box. They run too hot, and eventually fry. I switched to a much cooler GTX 650 and haven't had a problem since.
[07:34] <Hrakleaz> anyway
[07:34] <Hrakleaz> thx
[07:34] <I440r> no suitable module for running kernel found
[07:34] <Hrakleaz> i dont know it that btw
[07:34] <Hrakleaz> that dual core mean 64
[07:34] <Maverick_Hunter> keith_:  the GPU runs at a solid 66 degrees MAX, and it runs perfectly in windows 7, I don't think thats the issue
[07:34] <I440r> how do i update my kernel to something fred flintstone didnt use
[07:35] <I440r> like say 3.7.x?
[07:35] <klasa1b10_> siema noopby
[07:35] <klasa1b10_> co robicie
[07:36] <Maverick_Hunter> keith_:  I installed Nvidia-current, but is nvidia-settings required as well?
[07:36] <namespace> I440r: I'm fairly sure you just compile one. But I've never done it.
[07:36] <keith_> Maveric_Hunter: I know your angst... my vista boot works just fine with it. But under Ubuntu, the fan doesn't seem to be controlled as well. So, when it worked, it was at the upper temp limit - which isn't good for the die.

[07:37] <I440r> in gentoo yes. ubuntu NO
[07:37] <I440r> how do i apt-get up-to-date-kernel ?
[07:37] <Maverick_Hunter> keith_:  I will figure this out lol, I MUST

[07:38] <somsip> I440r: this might help: http://askubuntu.com/questions/160535/how-do-i-add-the-mainline-kernel-ppa
[07:38] <I440r> virtualbox does not have any modules for its additions tht WORK with the kernel that comes with 12.10
[07:38] <keith_> Maverick: Best of luck. Like I said, the only fix I found was to get rid of the GT series card. I'm running at 28C now - even under a really strong video load.

[07:39] <freak1> after expanding my disk i'm now thrown into initramfs
[07:39] <TXRoadkill_> The video on my Dell Dimension 8400 has been extremely sluggish and jerky since I installed 12.10.  Do I need to load a driver specific to the video card?
[07:40] <I440r> so i take it its not possible to apt-get install a linux kernel ?
[07:40] <I440r> a more up to date one i mean
[07:40] <sgtkilljoy> TXRoadkill_: wat card?
[07:40] <cfhowlett> I440r: not what you want to hear, I'm sure, but 12.04 is LTS (Long Term Support) ... unless you truly NEED the latest/greatest/shiny stuff?
[07:41] <TXRoadkill_> just a moment
[07:41] <namespace> I440r: I don't see one past 3.5 in precise.
[07:41] <I440r> cfhowlett, i installed the latest stable ubuntu
[07:41] <namespace> Using apt-cache search
[07:41] <I440r> NOBODY told me "dont install this if you want anything to work"
[07:42] <TXRoadkill_> 256MB ATI Radeon X800XT Ultra graphics card
[07:42] <I440r> i can totally understand why people are jumping the ubuntu ship in favor of mint
[07:42] <I440r> srsly
[07:42] <Flannel> I440r: Alright, time to adjust your attitude.  The folks here are volunteers, please make sure you respect that.  If you want virtualbox guest additions, install the vistualbox-guest-additions package.
[07:42] <stercor> Got xscreensaver installed, but there's no option for picking images from a directory.
[07:42] <ichat> I440r,  SO DO IT...  and dont be a jerk about it
[07:43] <I440r> Flannel, i did. it doesnt work
[07:43] <cfhowlett> I440r: understood.  In my experience, LTS is the better user option.  I'm not a developer, I don't need the newest shiny stuff.  LTS has a 5 year support lifetime, and your 12.10 has only 18 months.  Thus I recommend LTS.
[07:43] <Flannel> I440r: What "doesn't work" about it?
[07:43] <I440r> it CANT work because the additions do not support 3.5 kernels
[07:43] <I440r> everything didnt work about it
[07:43] <I440r> no suitable modules found for the running kernel
[07:43] <Flannel> I440r: Can you please give us some useful information to try to assist you?
[07:43] <I440r> no mouse integration
[07:43] <cfhowlett> I440r: also, this may be a problem that only virtualbox/oracle can solve and NOT an ubuntu issue.  That said, perhaps VMWare might work?
[07:43] <I440r> no video mode selection other than the default
[07:44] <I440r> cfhowlett, its not a vbox problem. vbox isnt whats broken here
[07:44] <cfhowlett> I440r: just a thought ...
[07:44] <I440r> Flannel, i did the VBoxLinuxAdditons.run and i did the apt-get install virtualbox-guest-additions
[07:44] <I440r> neither work. no suitable module for running kernel found
[07:45] <TXRoadkill_> <sgtkilljoy> TXRoadkill_: wat card? - 256MB ATI Radeon X800XT Ultra graphics card
[07:45] <I440r> i.e. virtualbox additions do not support kernel 3.5
[07:45] <ichat> I440r,  - if your having vbox kernel issiues compile your own... its what i did with make menu config  eassy as ... pie
[07:45] <ichat> it took me only some 15 attempts before i got it right
[07:45] <penguinman> I440r, have you tried installing them through virtualbox itself?
[07:45] <I440r> ichat in gentoo i will compile my own kernel. not under ubuntu
[07:46] <I440r> penguinman, yes thats how i installed them to begin with
[07:46] <Flannel> I440r: precise has guest-additions version 4.1.12, I'm sure it works with the precise kernels, because that's the whole point.  It looks like the package installs a CD, and then you have to run the exe (and reboot your guest addition).  See: http://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-virtualbox
[07:46] <I440r> am running that install again right now.
[07:46] <somsip> I440r: this looks like the same problem and is marked as solved http://www.kubuntuforums.net/archive/index.php/t-61234.html
[07:48] <Emanon> Then use gentoo and stop being annoying here.
[07:48] <keith_> I440r: Another possibility: http://aptosid.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&file=viewtopic&t=329
[07:48] <hilarious> do you guys have major problems with rhythmbox/banshee playing streams ?
[07:48] <hilarious> it's like, it will only play it once
[07:48] <I440r> Emanon, ok ill uninstall ubuntu and go with mint
[07:48] <I440r> ty
[07:48] <Flannel> I440r: Have a nice day!
[07:48] <Emanon> Have fun with that.
[07:48] <cfhowlett> I440r: hope it works out for you
[07:48] <I440r> Flannel, im not uninstalling ubuntu
[07:48] <Emanon> Good for you. Leave.
[07:49] <hilarious> i heard mint was slower
[07:49] <somsip> !ot | hilarious
[07:49] <ubottu> hilarious: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[07:49] <I440r> hilarious, ive never run it. but if its slower its also younger no?
[07:49] <hilarious> dunno, i don't want to discuss mint now
[07:49] <somsip> hilarious: thank you - it's appreciated
[07:50] <hilarious> anyone have problems with rhythmbox/banshee playing streams ?
[07:50] <TXRoadkill_> hilarious> anyone have problems with rhythmbox/banshee playing streams ? < I've had no problems with Rythmbox
[07:50] <penguinman> hilarious, not really, can you describe your issue?
[07:51] <hilarious> i play this one streaming address
[07:51] <hilarious> in rhythmbox, but then it just wouldn't open it any more
[07:51] <ichat> can anyone point me to troubleshoot why my laptop is going for a reboot when i   tell it to shutdown (from the guy)  12.10...  It even just asks me  if im sure to  shutdown (not reboot)
[07:51] <hilarious> so then i installed banshee
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[07:51] <hilarious> and it played it for awhile then i think i rebooted, same thing
[07:51] <Burnt_Reynolds> can anyone help me with this, i get this error after trying to run startx http://pastebin.com/57U3Dzjb
[07:52] <Burnt_Reynolds> i think its some kind of graphics error
[07:52] <elky> why are you needing to run startx?
[07:52] <I440r> nope. the "its solved" forum didnt fix the "it just works" for me. its still broken
[07:52] <Burnt_Reynolds> so i can install
[07:52] <I440r> and they are all going on about 3.7.x kernels. im not building any kernels in  ubuntu.
[07:53] <Burnt_Reynolds> off a cd
[07:53] <Burnt_Reynolds> dvd rather
[07:53] <mladoux> well, it's saying your modeline is wrong.
[07:53] <hilarious> anyone know a good alternative to banshee/rhythmbox ?
[07:53] <I440r> sudo /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup  <-- does not exist
[07:53] <Burnt_Reynolds> •mladoux• me?
[07:53] <mladoux> I don't know how to fix it, but that's what it says
[07:53] <ichat> hilarious,  - the newer vlc are alright again
[07:53] <mladoux> Burnt_Reynolds, yeah, you
[07:54] <Burnt_Reynolds> hmmm
[07:54] <cfhowlett> !nomodeset|Burnt_Reynolds
[07:54] <ubottu> Burnt_Reynolds: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[07:54] <mladoux> that's what V_BIOS address out of range means
[07:54] <Burnt_Reynolds> tried the nomodeset param before boot
[07:54] <Burnt_Reynolds> didnt work
[07:54] <penguinman> hilarious, there's several. clementine might be a good option, but i'm betting it has the same issue as i believe it uses the gstreamer backend as well.
[07:54] <mladoux> this one is beyond me, I wouldn't know where to begin on it, sorry. Well, mebbe, what gfx card you using?
[07:55] <mladoux> ...
[07:55] <hilarious> what do you think this issue is ?
[07:55] <penguinman> hilarious, is it just this one particular station or multiple ones?
[07:55] <hilarious> i guess whatever glitch, these two programs are almost identical
[07:55] <hilarious> i dunno, i haven't tried others
[07:55] <mladoux> @Burnt_Reynolds -- what gfx card you using?
[07:55] <Burnt_Reynolds> •mladoux• nvidia geforce gt 640m 2gb
[07:55] <hilarious> well actually yeah
[07:56] <hilarious> all the preset radio stations don't play either
[07:56] <Burnt_Reynolds> with nvidia optimus
[07:56] <I440r> sudo apt-get install --reinstall virtualbox-dkms ..... installs. runs script.. barfs with "No suitable module for running kernel found"
[07:56] <TXRoadkill_> I'm using a 256MB ATI Radeon X800XT Ultra graphics card in my Dell 8400.  Is it simply underpowered for Ubuntu 12.10?
[07:56] <mladoux> oh, okay... thats the one where they load an intel chip and swap over right?
[07:56] <hilarious> i will try vlc
[07:56] <Burnt_Reynolds> yes
[07:56] <mladoux> Because I don't know those, but I know where to look
[07:56] <mladoux> gimme one moment
[07:56] <Burnt_Reynolds> intel hd 4000 graphics
[07:57] <Burnt_Reynolds> intel i5 proc
[07:57] <mladoux> Burnt_Reynolds, if only it were that simple
=== Guest43344 is now known as awk
[07:57] <I440r> so i need a different kernel still and there isnt i can apt-get
[07:57] <I440r> awesome
[07:57] <I440r> "it just works - except when it doesnt your screwed"
[07:57] <mladoux> http://www.howtogeek.com/124685/how-to-make-nvidias-optimus-work-on-linux/ <== Burt_Reynolds
[07:58] <mysteriousdarren> TXRoadKill: I'd switch to a different desktop environment to add some extra speed for 12.10 I prefer lxde just a thought
[07:58] <Burnt_Reynolds> •mladoux• looking now
[07:58] <mladoux> anything beyond that tutorial is beyond what I know. Make sure you install linux_source and linux_headers_generic
[07:58] <penguinman> TXRoadkill_, which drivers are you using, the open ones or proprietary?
[07:58] <mladoux> um, convert _ to -
[07:58] <mladoux> sorry
[07:58] <namespace> Does anyone know where the gpg keys to verify my image are?
[07:59] <OerHeks> Burnt_Reynolds, see bumblebee https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee
[07:59] <TXRoadkill_> penguinman> TXRoadkill_, which drivers are you using, the open ones or proprietary? < whatever was installed with Ubuntu 12.10
[07:59] <ichat> can anyone point me to troubleshoot why my laptop is going for a reboot when i   tell it to shutdown (from the guy)  12.10...  It even just asks me  if im sure to  shutdown (not reboot)
[07:59] <TXRoadkill_> I've tried to keep the system as generic as possible
[07:59] <Burnt_Reynolds> will these solutions work when trying to boot off of a livedvd tho?
[07:59] <mladoux> Burt_Reynolds before running that tutorial install linux-source and linux-headers-generic, reboot your computer, then install the drivers
[07:59] <mladoux> Burnt no
[07:59] <Burnt_Reynolds> because i havent even gotteen the os's installed
[07:59] <mladoux> because they require a reboot
[07:59] <mladoux> you'll need to look into the alternative install
[07:59] <penguinman> TXRoadkill_, ok, so open ones. yeah, that is an older card. might want to try xfce or stick with 12.04 and unity 2d if you prefer a unity environment
[08:00] <mladoux> omgoodness, and it's not something i have time to walk someone through with right now
[08:00] <TXRoadkill_> OK, thanks penguinman :)
[08:00] <mladoux> mebbe someone else can help you.
[08:00] <mladoux> I've gotta get ready for work
[08:00] <dr_willis> ichat:  sounds like rather typical acpi/hardware power management bugs.  id check the bug report site to see if its a known issue with your laptop and if any work arounds are known. Its possible a kernel update may eventually fix the issue
[08:01] <Burnt_Reynolds> •mladoux• thanks anyways
[08:01] <ichat> dr_willis,  thnx...
[08:01] <mladoux> Burnt_Reynolds, sorry man
[08:01] <helmut_> hi
[08:01] <ichat> dr_willis,  - strange thing is, that   sudo shutdown 0  wil in fact shut the system down... correctly
[08:02] <dr_willis> ichat:  you could always make an icon to run that command i guess
[08:02] <machicola> is there a simple command line or filesystem way to set programs or scripts to start up at initialization of Gnome/Xwindows ? .. Outside of going to settings, preferences, or gnome-tweak-tool etc.
[08:02] <dr_willis>  machicola  .config/autorun I think
[08:02] <dr_willis> or was it .config/autostart
[08:03] <machicola> ok, thanks!!
[08:03] <penguinman> dr_willis, wow, i'd forgotten about that. unity has made me lazy i guess.
[08:07] <shlafrock> hey guys, i have a maveric server i have to install something on but there are no more maveric repositories, what could i use instead in sources.list ?
[08:08] <dr_willis> shlafrock:  change the sources.list to use that EOL archive servers
[08:08] <dr_willis> !eol
[08:08] <ubottu> End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[08:09] <shlafrock> thx
[08:09] <Burnt_Reynolds> •dr_willis• can u have a look at my error log?
[08:09] <Bull_Dim> sex
[08:11] <Burnt_Reynolds> •Error404NotFound•
[08:11] <Burnt_Reynolds> http://pastebin.com/57U3Dzjb
[08:11] <Burnt_Reynolds> error^
[08:12] <dr_willis> Burnt_Reynolds:   got 404 so nothng to look at.
[08:12] <Burnt_Reynolds> lol no thats someones name in here my irc script did that
[08:12] <IdleOne> Burnt_Reynolds: You running BT5?
[08:12] <Burnt_Reynolds> trying to
[08:12] <Burnt_Reynolds> lol
[08:12] <IdleOne> #backtrack-linux is the channel you need then.
[08:12] <dr_willis> dare we ask why...
[08:13] <Burnt_Reynolds> tried asking in there for 3 days no1 is there
[08:13] <IdleOne> BT is not supported in #ubuntu.
[08:14] <IdleOne> You don't go to a brain surgeon when you need a foot doctor.
[08:14] <dr_willis> sounds like a good reason to not use BT. :) or try the official BT channels on the other server.. not freenode.
[08:14] <Burnt_Reynolds> only know of the one server
[08:15] <Burnt_Reynolds> •IdleOne• sorry im new to linux, wanted to fiddle with pentesting at my house before i go to school next fall :P
[08:15] <TXRoadkill> No option to switch to Unity 2-D on startup :(
[08:15] <penguinman> Burnt_Reynolds, you're not trying to use backtrack as your daily driver are you?
[08:15] <Burnt_Reynolds> noooo
[08:15] <elky> Burnt_Reynolds, all the tools backtrack has you can put on ubuntu anyway
[08:16] <IdleOne> Burnt_Reynolds: that is fine but asking in here for support on some other distro (which is not meant to be installed but used as a live CD) is wrong.
[08:16] <Burnt_Reynolds> couldnt boot ubuntu either tho lolol
[08:16] <Burnt_Reynolds> actually held a screen with bt5 tho
[08:17] <Burnt_Reynolds> •IdleOne• well i figured the errors i had were more general in nature
[08:17] <Burnt_Reynolds> and i was also under the impression that bt5 was based off of ubuntu
[08:18] <IdleOne> Burnt_Reynolds: this is an Ubuntu support channel, for general linux support you can try ##linux but I still suggest you ask in the BT channel.
[08:18] <penguinman> Burnt_Reynolds, yeah, but backtrack's kernel is completely different
[08:18] <Burnt_Reynolds> soooo was just shaking multiple branches at once to see which drops the apples first :)
[08:18] <IdleOne> and wasting good apples
[08:18] <Burnt_Reynolds> lol wasted enough of your time
[08:18] <Burnt_Reynolds> sorry
[08:18]  * Burnt_Reynolds bows down
[08:18] <penguinman> Burnt_Reynolds, also, ubuntu is based off debian too, but god help you if you ask for ubuntu support in #debian :)
[08:19] <elky> we _will_ help you get ubuntu installed though, Burnt_Reynolds
[08:19] <leonanerdo> hi
[08:19] <Burnt_Reynolds> lol ok
[08:19] <Burnt_Reynolds> i get black screen when trying to boot ubuntu
[08:19] <Burnt_Reynolds> whats up with that
[08:19] <Burnt_Reynolds> 12.10
[08:19] <Burnt_Reynolds> 64bit
[08:19] <elky> what graphics card?
[08:19] <leonanerdo> when you get a chance not to be lurking
[08:20] <elky> and did you try the 32 bit version?
[08:20] <Burnt_Reynolds> nvidia geforce gt 640m
[08:20] <penguinman> Burnt_Reynolds, ok, this is going to sound dumb, but have you hit either enter or escape a couple times when you get that?
[08:20] <elky> leonanerdo, ask your question now and if anyone who sees it knows, they'll answer
[08:20] <Burnt_Reynolds> •penguinman• yes lol tried those
[08:21] <leonanerdo> can we go over commands
[08:21] <penguinman> Burnt_Reynolds, ok, just checking since my laptop does the same thing and that kicks me to the disk encryption unlock
[08:21] <leonanerdo> ty elky
[08:21] <elky> leonanerdo, like http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/linuxcommands.html ?
[08:21] <leonanerdo> ty
[08:21] <evol> Any one here have any clue how to install 12.04 or 12.10 on a laptop .... more specificly a toshiba satillite c855 with win 8 pre installed ive been woorking on it for weeks
=== smw_ is now known as smw
[08:22] <Burnt_Reynolds> •evol• trying something similar myself
[08:22] <penguinman> evol, have you unlocked the uefi or is it a bios model lappy?
[08:22] <SwedeMike> evol: if you don't write what goes wrong and what you've tried, it's impossible to help you.
[08:23] <evol> i changed to csm and that helped it actually bot to the splash screen but froze there
[08:23] <leonanerdo> how do i change servers and stay in this one
[08:24] <penguinman> leonanerdo, depends on the irc client you're using
[08:24] <leonanerdo> been along time sence on irc
[08:25] <dr_willis> leonanerdo:  you go to a server on the same network and the rooms are the same
[08:25] <penguinman> evol, i can't remember if the 12.10 installer has a text boot option, you may try that and see where it's hanging.
[08:26] <penguinman> evol, livecd i mean
[08:26] <evol> ive tried disc and tried usb tried in uefi and csm boot modes tried 12.04 and 12.10 ..... furthest ive gotten is it has loaded the splash screen and hung up there no ctrl alt dlt had to hard reset also created an partition on the harddrive for ubuntu but to no avail
[08:26] <Phil> Hello guys, could someone help me with the ubuntu installation? It gets stuck, when it should search for Partitions or Operating Systems
[08:26] <evol> that help ?
[08:26] <leonanerdo> whoops i mean network
[08:27] <penguinman> Phil, that part can take a while, how long are you giving it?
[08:27] <sgtkilljoy> leonanerdo: wat client?
[08:27] <Phil> About 10-15 Minutes
[08:27] <leonanerdo> xchat sg
[08:28] <penguinman> leonanerdo, oh just open up the server list then
[08:28] <lcabreza> why does java don't make a deb version of their application ?
[08:28] <sgtkilljoy> leonanerdo: xchat > new > server tab
[08:28] <goddard> anyone know if scp skips files when they already exist?
[08:29] <leonanerdo> ok
[08:29] <bekks> goddard: Yes. No.
[08:29] <leonanerdo> ty
[08:29] <goddard> bekks: No. Yes.
[08:29] <Phil> I had to start the installation with acpi=off, otherwise it got stuck at the bootscreen
[08:30] <vlt> Hello. Yesterday I installed Ubuntu 12.04 which replaced my old Debian Xen dom0 (with kernel 3.0.0 on xen 4.0.2), now it’s the current kernel 3.2.0 and xen 4.1.2.  Since then my HVM client’s users (Windows 2008) complain about performance issues.  Any idea where to begin troubleshooting this?
[08:30] <bekks> goddard: Two questions, two answers...
[08:30] <hero616> How can I get the source code related to the software installed from Synaptic?
[08:30] <evol> ok does anyone know another place i can find help ?
[08:30] <subcool> can someone assist me in understanding and fixing the flash update for chrome.
[08:30] <penguinman> Phil, hmm, any weirdness like encrypted drives?
[08:30] <goddard> bekks: is it possible to do?
[08:31] <bekks> goddard: No.
[08:31] <goddard> bekks: how does nautilus do it
[08:31] <bekks> goddard: If you want to do so, use rsync, which uses-e ssh by default.
[08:33] <leonanerdo> my bad in command how do i switch to efnet or etc move around a bit
[08:33] <leonanerdo> and still stay her
[08:33] <gbear14275> I have openjdk 7 installed but chrome keeps prompting me to download java...  I'm looking through options but figured I'd check here if this was common
[08:33] <leonanerdo> e
[08:33] <Phil> I don't know. It's an acer notebook, thats about 2 years old. I have one drive with tree partitions System, NTFS (Win8 Preview) and one ext3 with my old Linux Mint intstallation on it
[08:34] <gbear14275> hoping someone can tell me current best practice
[08:34] <bekks> !java > gbear14275
[08:34] <ubottu> gbear14275, please see my private message
[08:34] <Phil> do you know wether ubuntu can recognize Win8 Prev?
[08:36] <mladoux> try "sudo ldconfig" and restart chrome
[08:36] <mladoux> @gbear sorry
[08:36] <gbear14275> bekks, had that open in another site but thank you, does chrome require the icedtea plugin?
[08:37] <bekks> gbear14275: No. It just requires a java plugin.
[08:37] <Burnt_Reynolds> so i can get my external hdmi monitor to display when i boot ubuntu from dvd, but it wont use my laptop screen at all, tried the keyboard shortcut for screen swap and it just turns off my external hdmi monitor and the laptop screen stays black. but when i keyboard shortcut again it turns the hdmi monitor back on
[08:37] <penguinman> Phil, that i don't know since i avoided it like the plague. i think on a regular bios computer the bootloader should be recoignized as win 7.
[08:37] <subcool> is it really so easy to fix, that im just not finding the right google search?
[08:37] <gbear14275> mladoux, restart browser after?
[08:37] <subcool> cause im coming up with nothing useful
[08:38] <mladoux> yeah
[08:38] <mladoux> gbear14275, doesn't always work, but usually does
[08:38] <gbear14275> bekks, mladoux thank you for the help, just ran ldconfig and restarted chrome, still prompting to install plugin
[08:39] <gbear14275> mladoux, never heard of that command, was hopeful :)
[08:39] <zznhello> :-)
[08:39] <Burnt_Reynolds> does ubuntu support intel hd 4000
[08:39] <Burnt_Reynolds> graphics
[08:39] <penguinman> gbear14275, you may be able to manually set the plugin.
[08:39] <mladoux> gbear14275, it just tells linux to rescan and register it's dynamic libraries, well, that's a bit over simplified, but you get the idea.
[08:39] <freak1> hi guys, i have a serious issue with my ubuntu machine. I added extra diskspace with my LVM setup and now I have a device-mapper : table : sda 3 too small for target issue and my machine boots into initramfs
[08:40] <penguinman> Burnt_Reynolds, yes, intel graphics are very wel supported under most nix distros.
[08:40] <gbear14275> mladoux, yeah, and I prefer that to a manual install, would really like to keep automatic updates working
[08:40] <freak1> is there someone that has any knowledge about this? then I can explain what I did...
[08:40] <gbear14275> penguinman, I could, but does it normally work out of the box?
[08:40] <mladoux> heh, work has me doing custom installs right now.

[08:41] <zznhello> ╰_╯
[08:41] <penguinman> gbear14275, last time i tried actual chrome it did, but i haven't used it recently as i prefer chromium
[08:41] <zznhello> （＊￣︶￣＊）
[08:41] <gbear14275> penguinman, I wonder what I dorked up...
[08:41] <mladoux> I got java working on chrome, but I don't remember what I did. I can't get to an ubuntu machine right now to figure it out, so meh
[08:42] <gbear14275> mladoux, I appreciate the effort, I just redid a clean install... so I'm wondering what I could have screwed up already...
[08:42] <bkerensa> !rules > zznhello
[08:42] <ubottu> zznhello, please see my private message
[08:42] <penguinman> gbear14275, you may want to try chromium, does just about everything regular chrome does but the source is open
[08:43] <gbear14275> penguinman, used to be a chromium user.  moved to chrome for the stability and the account integration, heh funny its not working now
[08:44] <penguinman> gbear14275, actually chromium integrates with your google account now if you want it to.
[08:45] <penguinman> also pulls down all your synced addons too.
[08:45] <mladoux> gbear14275, sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_03/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so /opt/google/chrome/plugins/
[08:45] <mladoux> that should fix it
[08:45] <mladoux> restart browser after
[08:46] <ogist> hello
[08:46] <gbear14275> penguinman, might have to move back then...  looks like the only significant diff is pdf viewer goo.gl/Iu4ax
[08:47] <mladoux> gbear14275, I found the fix, in a terminal "sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/jdk1.7.0_03/jre/lib/amd64/libnpjp2.so /opt/google/chrome/plugins/"
[08:47] <mladoux> that will fix it.
[08:47] <mladoux> um, well, that's for a 64-bit install
[08:47] <penguinman> gbear14275, that and built in flash, but flash is soon to go the way of the dodo with html 5 coming out
[08:47] <gbear14275> mladoux, great one sec and I'll report back
[08:47] <gbear14275> mladoux, i'm 64bit
[08:47] <ogist> i recently got a new 1 tb hard drive and installed ubuntu on it, and i have a 250gb hard drive that i was using to hold movies on when i had windows installed on a seperate disk... I found the 250gb hard drive in ubuntu, but it does not show any of the folders or movies :(
[08:47] <mladoux> you'll need to change amd64 to i386 on a 32-bit machine
[08:47] <mladoux> cool
[08:47] <mladoux> openjdk7, right?
[08:48] <gbear14275> mladoux, yeah, let me go run it and check (going to man the command first)
[08:48] <mogaj> Assistance needed Unable to login to Ubuntu Amazon instance through ssh,what am i doing wrong http://pastebin.com/2v9rD4Cq
[08:48] <mladoux> lol
[08:48] <mladoux> it's creating a symbolic link to the plugin to where google expects to find it btw.
[08:49] <penguinman> gbear14275, it's just a symlink command
[08:49] <ogist> how do i locate the movie files on my 250gb hard drive? ubuntu is not showing them
[08:49] <mladoux> you need sudo because it's outside of your home directory
[08:49] <gbear14275> mladoux, penguinman yeah saw that :), sorry trying to learn instead of just repeat, but checking the paths now
[08:49] <mladoux> lol
[08:49] <mladoux> yeah, double check the paths
[08:49] <gbear14275> so is it creating the first path?  because that currently doesn't exist
[08:49] <Phil> penguinman, sorry, of course there are no encrypted drives. I started the installation, and aborted it, because it got stuck for quite a while. Now I'm in the "Starter Disc"-like mode. I mounted the Partition with windows 8, so it isn't recognized by the Setup, but it's still stuck at the same place
[08:49] <mladoux> I'm assuming you said OpenJDK
[08:49] <gbear14275> mladoux, I did, yeah
[08:50] <mladoux> you'd have to use a different path for a different version of java
[08:50] <mladoux> so double check everything first
[08:50] <bkerensa> mogaj: Make sure the pem file is not readable to everyone
[08:50] <Phil> penguinman - again stuck
[08:50] <mladoux> gbear14275, and good for you, i encourage people man things before running commands strangers give them when they don't know what they do.
[08:51] <penguinman> Phil, hmmm, you may want to give the alternate install a go.
[08:51] <ogist> is anyone going to help me?
[08:51] <mogaj> bkerensa : i gave it 600 permissins and its folder 700 permissions
[08:51] <mladoux> okay, back to work, my brief break while compiling is over.
[08:52] <bkerensa> mogaj: chmod 400
[08:53] <bkerensa> mogaj: chmod 400 yourfile.pem
[08:53] <altin> Unsupported audio codec: libmp3lame
[08:53] <altin> anyone eveer had this prob ?
[08:53] <gbear14275> mladoux, hmm, my directories don't match...
[08:53] <bkerensa> altin: you need to ensure you have the right codecs installed
[08:54] <penguinman> altin, try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras. that should pull down your non-free codecs like mp3
[08:54] <mogaj> bkernsa : getting same error
[08:54] <usr13> altin: You have mplayer installed?
[08:54] <gbear14275> no /plugins/ under the chrome path and my openjdk path is */jvm/java-* (three options)
[08:55] <gbear14275> but I see what the idea is...
[08:55] <altin> bkerensa: I'm trying for an hour now
[08:56] <altin> penguinman: yes I have them
[08:56] <bkerensa> altin: You can run "sudo apt-get install libmp3lame0" from terminal without quotes
[08:56] <bkerensa> should sort you out
[08:56] <altin> bkerensa: it is installed
[08:56] <altin> idk why its not working
[08:56] <altin> im using kdenlive
[08:57] <gbear14275> mladoux, I also don't have that file "libnpjp2.so"
[08:57] <bkerensa> altin: what happens if you.... sudo apt-get install kdenlive
[08:57] <bekks> gbear14275: Did you follow the link ubottu gave you?
[08:57] <bekks> !java | gbear14275
[08:57] <ubottu> gbear14275: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[08:58] <Burnt_Reynolds> im going to go try running ubuntu again
[08:58] <Burnt_Reynolds> wish me luck
[08:58] <usr13> altin: run the configuration wizard of kdenlive ?
[08:58] <gbear14275> bekks, yes and I read that.  But I'm wondering why installing java and chrome both from the software center isn't playing nice... I assume these should be working by default
[08:59] <altin> bkerensa: kdenlive is installed and my project is in half, cannot render it bcs of that codec
[08:59] <bkerensa> altin: what architecture are you on?
[09:00] <bekks> gbear14275: I'd use a recent JDK version anyway.
[09:00] <altin> bkerensa: 64bit
[09:00] <gbear14275> bekks, I also was under the impression that chrome didn't use "browser plugins"
[09:00] <bekks> gbear14275: Which is wrong.
[09:00] <gbear14275> bekks, that's why I'm here
[09:01] <bkerensa> altin: can you save your project and delete kdenliverc in ~/.kde/share/config and see if that resolves it?
[09:02] <altin> bkerensa: just fixed it...
[09:03] <bkerensa> altin: so that did fix it indeed?
[09:04] <altin> i did two things at the same time not sure which one worked
=== Anael is now known as Guest1199
[09:04] <altin> i installed mplayer2 and at the same time ran that config wizard
[09:04] <altin> bkerensa:
[09:05] <altin> thanks btw :)
[09:05] <kubanc> what's the best version of Ubuntu to run with ZPanel?
[09:05] <usr13> altin: Prolly installing mplayer did it
[09:05] <bkerensa> kubanc: ask the authors... We cannot tell you what will work best with third party applications
[09:06] <kubanc> bkerensa, is there any web hosting control panel that Ubuntu works best with, and it's also free
[09:08] <altin> usr13: I actually had mplayer but got rid of that and installed mplayer2 instead
[09:09] <usr13> altin: Ahhh ok.
[09:17] <mladoux> gbear14275, sorry, I'm kinda in the middle of system code right now.
[09:18] <mladoux> when I get a free moment, if you haven't been helped by then, I'll take another look

[09:21] <vlt> Since I updated to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (from Debian with kernel 3.0.0 and xen 4.0.2) the load on the dom0 system is unusually high and my HVM client’s users (Windows 2008) keep complaining about performance issues.  Any idea where to begin troubleshooting this?
[09:21] <Ben64> vlt: how did you update from debian to ubuntu?
[09:24] <ruud> morning
[09:24] <hedonai> Is it still okay to ask questions or is everyone sleep?
[09:25] <hedonai> morning ruud
[09:25] <aberrant> has anyone had problems installing postgres on 12.04 64-bit?
[09:26] <ruud> anybody running 12.10 on a macbook pro (2010) ?
[09:27] <ruud> just cant get the nvidia drivers running :(
[09:27] <hedonai> anyone using a cell phone for tethering? is there a way to tether or reset the tether without using unity?
[09:30] <hedonai> Like i thought .. everyone is sleep
=== song is now known as Guest9721
[09:31] <ruud> seems so
[09:33] <Gazra> Hello, anybody here?
[09:35] <hedonai> people are here
[09:35] <hedonai> just i'm guessing in and out
[09:37] <Gazra> I bought a Samsung Smart TV, and well the Smart TV functionality from Samsung is terrible. I actually connected a Linux box to it and Im using a Di Novo Bluetooth keyboard. So the TV supports 1920x1080, but under that resolution I get a terrible overscan problem. Automatically it only works fin under the 1680x1050. Does anyone know how to correct the overscan?
[09:38] <Gazra> I have been searching for days in Google, the only options where for Proprietary drivers for ATI & Nvidia, but in my case I have a INtel graphics card.
[09:38] <thor> Gazra: the overscan issue is a known issue with Samsung TVs, I only know a workaround for Nvidia
[09:39] <thor> essentially what you do is set the screen resolution to 1680x1050 or similar to make it non-1080p
[09:40] <Gazra> thor, thanks for your answer, I found also that for ATI & Nvidia, but as I said, I have an Intel 4000HD graphics card.
[09:42] <thor> Gazra: I know, Have you tried just setting a custom resolution with xrandr/xorg config?
[09:43] <vlt> Ben64: I installed a fresh Ubuntu 12.04 via debootstrap into an empty file system, installed the kernel to the /boot partition and did a reboot.
[09:43] <Gazra> thor, yes
[09:44] <thor> Gazra: and? profit?
[09:44] <Gazra> I haven't found a way to make the 1920x1080 to work fine
[09:46] <Tecan> im not sure how but you guys need to but the zlib-dev package into the repo's for 12.10
=== kannibal is now known as Guest41439
=== Guest41439 is now known as kingkannibal
[09:49] <thor> Gazra: it's something you need to figure out on your tv, afaik on the smart tv I've tried on, it's not possible to disable overscan
[09:49] <Gazra> In the TV there is an option Fit to screen,
[09:50] <Ben64> the solution is in the tv manual
[09:50] <Gazra> thor, In the TV there is an option Fit to screen, and then it fits with the 1920x1080, but it looks terrible!
[09:50] <kingkannibal> does Playonlinux have a help irc?
[09:51] <Gazra> Ben64,  In the TV there is an option Fit to screen, and then it fits with the 1920x1080, but it looks terrible!
[09:51] <truexfan81> kingkannibal: yes #playonlinux
[09:51] <kingkannibal> thanks
[09:51] <Ben64> Gazra: what does that mean
[09:52] <Tecan> zlib 1.2.3
[09:52] <Gazra> Ben64, the fonts are not sharp, eveything looks terrible, it hurts the eyes!
[09:53] <Ben64> then don't use that option
[09:53] <Gazra> Ben64, any other option doesn't fit into the screen!
[09:53] <Ben64> i dunno, read your tv manual
[09:53] <Gazra> Ben64, I have tried everything!
[09:54] <Ben64> impossible
[09:57] <Gazra> Ben64, at least everything I found, I have been trying for days!
[09:57] <pouncer> Hello all O/
[09:58] <UbuntuWarrior> hello
[09:58] <pouncer> how is everyone this morning
[09:58] <UbuntuWarrior> good :D
[09:59] <UbuntuWarrior> how are you Pouncer?
[10:00] <pouncer> Doing ok trying to figure out why the software center keeps crashing out on my fresh install of 12.10
[10:00] <UbuntuWarrior> oh thats is not so nice...
[10:00] <pouncer> haha it is if you enjoy this kinda thing :P
[10:01] <pouncer> trying to solve the mystery of the pain in the ass software center lmao
[10:02] <UbuntuWarrior> i wish good luck :D
[10:02] <pouncer> hehe ty .. so what is everyone doing today
[10:03] <onlybASS> ruskije estj tut?
[10:03] <UbuntuWarrior> I sit in the school and have to study :(
[10:04] <mili> hi. i'm having a weird issue.  i've installed 12.10 on 2 laptops tonight, one an HP with an atheros wifi chip and the other a toshiba with a centrino.  both are having weird hiccups and hangups in network access, but both have no problem when running windows
[10:04] <user_> hola alguien me dice como se entra en el canal de ubuntu en español
[10:04] <pouncer> hey charish thouse days they are great compared to whats coming later lol
[10:04] <mili> network access will be ok for a minute, then slow or non-existent for a minute, back and forth
[10:04] <UbuntuWarrior> @ mili do you have only problems with wifi or with ethernet to?
[10:05] <pouncer> youll have to compile drivers or hook it up to the Ethernet cord and hope that there are some restricted drivers for it i would say
[10:05] <mili> haven't been able to try ethernet.  the router is in a room i don't have access to.
[10:05] <UbuntuWarrior> I think you can try wicd as a alternative wifi manager
[10:06] <mili> i'm not sure about drivers, it's the same behaviour on two different wifi cards.  then again i haven't run ubuntu in 3-4 years
[10:07] <UbuntuWarrior> maybe you should try ubuntu 12.04 as last alternative
[10:07] <pouncer> have you hooked it up to an Ethernet cord yet
[10:07] <mili> sigh.  i wondered about that but really didn't watn to have to reinstall.
[10:08] <UbuntuWarrior> key I think you should try wicd
[10:09] <mili> hmmm ok i will
[10:10] <UbuntuWarrior> i hope for that it will work
[10:10] <UbuntuWarrior> :D
=== Noskcaj is now known as Noskcaj-afk
[10:10] <mili> trying different packages can be a pain, most install attempts fail due to network stalling out, usually have to retry a few times
[10:10] <pouncer> damn well that solution turned out not to work i was so hoping it was going to be that easy lol but never is
[10:11] <mili> i'm getting a lot of 'no address associated with hostname' errors when i try to use apt-get
[10:12] <Gazra> thor, I found the solution!! I can't belive it!
[10:13] <Gazra> I had to rename the source to DVI PC!
[10:13] <Gazra> thor, I had to rename the source to DVI PC! It's crazy! But now it works!
[10:13] <UbuntuWarrior> mili, do you have check the network cards via sudo ifconfig?

[10:29] <Gazra> thor, yes, on the TV!
[10:29] <pouncer> then you probobly have some hardware that doesnt agree with it i know i had the same problem trying to put it on my desktop when i had my internal wifi card in as soon as i took it out it worked fine you might want to try a later version
[10:29] <thor> Gazra: how? I can't remember finding any place to re-name it there?
[10:29] <pouncer> evol
[10:30] <evol> yes pouncer?
[10:30] <Gazra> thor, it is not documented and the Samsung Hotline had no idea about it! I just found it in a forum!
[10:30] <thor> Thiago_FM: Good idea to just state your issue/ask your question
[10:30] <thor> Gazra: link?
[10:30] <Gazra> thor, which model do you have?
[10:30] <Thiago_FM> Tank you thor
[10:31] <evol> fill look into that
[10:31] <pouncer> i forgot to put your name in my previous message is all lol
[10:31] <evol> ok
[10:31] <thor> Gazra: can't remember right now, it's 2nd gen smart tv I think
[10:31] <Gazra> thor, just go to sources and then press on the source you want to modify
[10:31] <thor> Gazra: press menu on it?
[10:32] <Thiago_FM> I have a problem with the initial asterisk configuration o ubuntu server 12.10... I can't start asterisk after installation, even on the default config
[10:32] <evol> any sugestions on a later version that may be better suited ?
[10:32] <Gazra> thor, select the source you want to edit and press the TOOLS button
[10:33] <thor> Gazra: Thanks :) going to give that a shot when I get home *watches the clock tick closer to 3pm*
[10:33] <pouncer> mighty try 11.04 if that doesnt work then you might just have to wait a bit till they can get a proper support for the hardware that it doesnt like i know it took about 5 months for them to correct whatever problem was conflicting with my hardware
[10:34] <Gazra> thor, I was looking for days!!! I'm so happy that it works now!
[10:34] <thor> Gazra: sounds good, can't wait to test
[10:34] <pouncer> you might try a diff distro like mint or try somthing like UE
[10:34] <evol> thanks for your assistance
[10:35] <Kr0ll> Hi guys , how to add a search icon on the task bar?
[10:37] <pouncer> Kr0ll .. on what version and distro and what are you trying to use to search your desktop or net
[10:38] <mili> so if i have wicd and it's working better for me, how do i get rid of the wifi manager that's already running in gnome
[10:39] <pouncer> you can probobly do it throught the synaptic package manager or the software center mili just make sure you have that program set to autostart
[10:39] <david__> Hi im new to linxu could somebody help me with an error im getting trying to install a file

[10:40] <david__> well im trying to get it to start on boot up
[10:40] <david__> the file is a razer cfg for my mouse
[10:40] <david__> and when i put the scipt in this ln -s /etc/init.d/razerd /etc/rc2.d/S99razerd
[10:40] <david__> it tells me failed to create sybolic link
[10:41] <dr_willis> david__:  you are using sudo to mess with system directories?
[10:41] <david__> the exact words it tells me is ln: failed to create symbolic line '/etc/rc2d/d/s99razerd'
[10:41] <dr_willis> since you need root rights to alter things in /etc/
[10:42] <david__> well ive tried to do this in root
[10:42] <david__> and it still gives me that error
[10:42] <david__> i typed in sudo su
[10:42] <david__> which gives me root
[10:42] <dr_willis> you dont want to use 'sudo su'
[10:42] <dr_willis> just try the command with sudo, or use sudo -s to get a root shell
[10:42] <david__> ok let me try
[10:43] <dr_willis> i alwyas get ln backwareds also ;)

[10:44] <dr_willis> look at it?   ls -l /etc/rc2.d/S99razerd
[10:44] <david__> o ok so does that mean its good to go?
[10:45] <dr_willis> No idea.. Its saying it exists. :) if thats what you wanted
[10:45] <dr_willis> it dosent just overwrite the file if you rerun the ln command. :) so verify the file is linked to where it should be.
[10:46] <david__> ah ok let me check
[10:46] <pouncer> so ive put a fresh install of 12.10 on my desktop had a few bugs the only one i haven't been able to fix so far is that the software center either crashes as soon as it opens up or refuses to open at all any advice from anyone ive tryed a few diff things but nothings worked
[10:47] <dr_willis> pouncer:  I just use synaptic. :) i find software center gives me very little benifits
[10:47] <dr_willis>  you could run it from a terminal and look for error messages. but  thats about all the advice i can give.
[10:48] <pouncer> k ty
[10:48] <david__> ok dr willis
[10:48] <david__> i am trying to make sure its there
[10:48] <david__> but when i go into init.d razer doesnt exist
[10:48] <david__> razerd*
[10:49] <david__> wait
[10:49] <david__> one sec
[10:49] <dr_willis> you were linking from raxerd to s99razerd   so where did razerd comefrom in the first place? ;)
[10:50] <david__> ok well im in  etc/init.d and i see  something in green called razerd does green mean file?
[10:50] <dr_willis> use ls -l. look at the moded and permissions
[10:50] <dr_willis> dont go by color
[10:51] <david__> it says -rwxr-xr-x
[10:51] <dr_willis> i would guess it means executable.
[10:52] <david__> still looking in etc rc2.d i cannot find
[10:53] <dr_willis> ls -l /etc/rc2.d/S99razerd
[10:53] <dr_willis> would be the command to see its info
[10:53] <david__> ahhh
[10:53] <david__> ok i have found the file
[10:53] <david__> so i have confirmed both files exist
[10:54] <dr_willis> whats this razerd supposed to do anyway?
[10:54] <david__> does this mean i already had them and this is the reason for the error?
[10:54] <dr_willis> the link was there.. thats why it said it existed..
[10:54] <david__> razerd is the drivers for my razer mouse
[10:54] <dr_willis> now ifyou did that.. or soome else did it.. no idea
[10:54] <dr_willis> hmm. i dont need any drivers for my razer mouse. ;)
[10:55] <david__> think i may have done it but didnt realize it
[10:55] <david__> well
[10:55] <david__> i like to use a different dpi
[10:55] <david__> from the stock
[10:55] <Ben64> seems weird that it'd be in init though
[10:55] <david__> im using deathadder and 3500 is to much xD
[10:55] <david__> well it tells me in order to get it to boot from start up
[10:56] <david__> you have to create a init script
[10:56] <dr_willis> i would think just running the command from the users  ~/.config/autostart/ would work just as well
[10:56] <Ben64> and you should be able to adjust mouse speed without changing dpi
[10:56] <david__> ben are you talking about using the slider
[10:56] <dr_willis> some of these razers got crazy high dpi. ;)   I think theres a button on the bottom to tweak it on some mice
[10:56] <Ben64> maybe?
[10:57] <dr_willis> got a death adder 3500 here.
[10:57] <Ben64> dpi is just the resolution of the mouse to detect movement, doesn't necessarily have to correlate with on screen movement
[10:57] <david__> well i feel its hard to get it to what im use to playing by the slider alone
[10:57] <david__> yah im using the 3500 also
[10:57] <lcabreza> anybody has an idea about this error : tio_get_rs232_lines: TIOCMGET failed: Input/output error
[10:58] <david__> dr willis
[10:58] <david__> thank you for helping me
[10:58] <dr_willis> default dpi is fine here. ;) what guides are you following/where did you get these commands from david__ ?
[10:58] <david__> im new :(
[10:58] <dr_willis> i Mouse across the screen in about 4 inches of travel.
[10:58] <Ben64> its fine to be new. dr_willis used to be new too
[10:58] <david__> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Razer
[10:59] <dr_willis> Ben64:   when i was new - schools were teaching 'computers' on Vic-20's
[10:59] <Ben64> oh, well then you were never new
[11:00] <dr_willis> You could just start the razerd service from /etc/rc.local also.
[11:01] <dr_willis> instead of links and stuff. ;)
[11:01] <david__> so to test this
[11:01] <david__> i just reboot
[11:01] <david__> and when i log in
[11:02] <david__> should the program boot up or will i still need to put sudo razerd
[11:02] <dr_willis> where did you get the binaries for razerd from forubuntu? you compiled them?
[11:02] <david__> there was a readme
[11:02] <david__> it said this
[11:02] <dr_willis> the whole point of the linking was to make service/init script to run them at boot time
[11:02] <dr_willis> you could have just put 'razerd &' in /etc/rc.local also. ;P
[11:02] <david__> First invoke "cmake" to build the makefiles.
[11:02] <david__> Then invoke "make" to build the binaries.
[11:03] <david__> To automatically start the required system daemon "razerd" at system bootup time,
[11:03] <david__> you need to install the init-script. This software package includes a generic
[11:03] <david__> example script, that should work out-of-the-box on many Linux distributions.
[11:03] <david__> To install it, invoke the following commands:
[11:03] <david__>   sudo -i	# become root
[11:03] <FloodBot1> david__: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[11:03] <david__>   cp ./razerd.initscript /etc/init.d/razerd
[11:04] <blag> with gcc I can pass macro defines with the -D[macro] flag, is there a similar flag for make to make it pass the -D[macro] flag to all invocations of gcc?
[11:06] <david__> ok so when i reboot
[11:06] <awolf> hello all
[11:06] <david__> the program is suppose to load correct?
[11:06] <awolf> I need help installing nvidia geforce drivers 64 bit on ubuntu 12.04 lts

[11:07] <awolf> ?
[11:07] <david__> i will reboot
[11:08] <cfhowlett> lemonsparrow: 10.10 is end of life and now unsupported
[11:08] <awolf> gnome shell 3 doesnt work
[11:08] <dr_willis> awolf:  you dont have one of those fancy dual-gpu optmius things do you?
[11:08] <awolf> i have a geforce gt 630M
[11:08] <dr_willis> awolf:  if not.. i alwyas just install nvidia-current package. or use the addaditional-drivers tool (gksudo jockey-gtk)
[11:08] <lemonsparrow> smw: can I upgrade without having to lose my data.. just like s/w update
[11:09] <awolf> i did install the nvidia current but no results
[11:09] <dr_willis> >>>>>>  Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[11:09] <awolf> i still get unknown driver from the details section
[11:09] <dr_willis> thats a yes. :)
[11:09] <ahmed_> hello everybody
[11:09] <cfhowlett> lemonsparrow: not easily.  best bet is a clean install of the newest LTS release: 12.04
[11:09] <dr_willis> awolf:  you did reboot after installing them?
[11:09] <lemonsparrow> cfhowlett: hmm
[11:09] <cfhowlett> ahmed_: greetings
[11:09] <awolf> yes many times
[11:09] <awolf> tried many things
[11:09] <awolf> when i come to install it manually from the terminal
[11:09] <Robin0800> lemonsparrow: you have duplicate or old sources in  the folder all errors have already been hit if you check
[11:09] <cfhowlett> lemonsparrow: back up your data
[11:09] <awolf> in the following manner
[11:10] <ahmed_> i'm sing gnacktrak
[11:10] <ahmed_> and i have problem
[11:10] <lemonsparrow> Robin0800: ok
[11:10] <ahmed_> with the wirless
[11:10] <awolf> stop lightdm -> init 3  -> sudo sh Nvi...
[11:10] <ahmed_> driver
[11:10] <ahmed_> anybody help me
[11:10] <awolf> it works but installation wont complete
[11:11] <cfhowlett> lemonsparrow: I don't know what hardware you've got but assuming it's as - vintage - as the OS, consider xubuntu or lubuntu.  Both are optimized for older and low spec machines.
[11:11] <ahmed_> don't wait a time
[11:11] <awolf> it wont ever start it says pre=start script not found or something like that
[11:11] <lemonsparrow> cfhowlett: is there for now a quick hack around ?
[11:12] <david__> ok i rebooted
[11:12] <cfhowlett> lemonsparrow: I'm in China and for some reason, the link you sent was blocked.  Don't know what exact issue you were highlighting ...
[11:12] <david__> and nothing popped up so i tried to run it using sudo razerd
[11:12] <ahmed_> anyone use gnacktrak
[11:12] <david__> librazer: No config file /etc/razer.conf present. Ignoring.
[11:12] <david__> Failed to bind socket to /var/run/razerd/socket: Address already in use
[11:12] <ahmed_> please for help
[11:13] <lemonsparrow> cfhowlett: sudo apt-get update is giving me that
[11:13] <ahmed_> no wireless coneion
[11:13] <cfhowlett> lemonsparrow: "that" is what I can't see, but I'm guessing that update won't update since it's EOL.  EOL means EOL, i.e. no further support offered.
[11:14] <lemonsparrow> cfhowlett: ok
[11:14] <dr_willis> david__:   You can copy thge razer.conf file to /etc/ for default settings
[11:15] <Ben64> lemonsparrow: you got the link twice on how to upgrade now
[11:15] <awolf> Does anyone know how I can install the drivers
[11:15] <awolf> ?
[11:15] <dr_willis> david__:  the razerd servcuce should allready be running.. that was the whole point of the init links
[11:15] <lemonsparrow> Ben64: yes thanks :)
[11:15] <cfhowlett> lemonsparrow: that said, it's not like 10.10 will suddenly stop working, but an upgrade should be on your list of things to do in the very near future.
[11:15] <david__> ah ok
[11:15] <Ben64> awolf: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[11:16] <david__> i typed in qrazercfg and the program is running now
[11:16] <dr_willis> david__:   razercfg -s
[11:16] <dr_willis> Mouse:DeathAdder 3500DPI:USB-002:1532-0016-0
[11:16] <dr_willis> And i edited the config to turn off my leds ;)
[11:17] <awolf> ben i tried it no result
[11:17] <awolf> heres the result of lspci | grep VGA

[11:17] <awolf> 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation Device 0de9 (rev a1)
[11:17] <david__> so you have to type in razercfg -s every time you reboot?
[11:17] <Ben64> awolf: really? nothing at all happened? just blank?
[11:17] <awolf> i installed it but still i couldnt work with the nvidia
[11:17] <Ben64> awolf: you should have said you had dual gpu when you were asked about it
[11:18] <awolf> i didnt know
[11:18] <awolf> this is a new laptop
[11:18] <awolf> i just bought actually
[11:18] <awolf> my mistake
[11:18] <FloodBot1> awolf: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[11:18] <david__> i mean qrazercfg
[11:18] <dr_willis> david__:  no.. thats the point of the stuff is to save to a config file that gets auto loaded.
[11:18] <dr_willis> run   --->   qrazercfg
[11:19] <awolf> how can i fix my issue ?
[11:19] <david__> ok so how do i save my settings
=== marco is now known as Guest64893
[11:19] <david__> like if i wanted it to run at 1800 dpi at startup
[11:20] <dr_willis> use the menu... and exit theapp
[11:20] <dr_willis> it applys the changes on the fly. ;)
[11:21] <david__> im not sure what you mean by menu
[11:21] <david__> sorry
[11:21] <Guest64893> d
[11:21] <david__> right now i have the program running
[11:21] <dr_willis> the menu that 99.999% of all programs use these days.. You juyst set the changes.. and exit.
[11:21] <david__> with the settings i like
[11:22] <david__> so if i exit the program
[11:22] <david__> it will auto save?
[11:22] <dr_willis> Try it and see
[11:22] <david__> yay :D
[11:22] <dr_willis> be sort of pointless it if dident have a save feature and it dident auto save...
[11:22] <david__> ok im going to reboot one more time
[11:23] <awolf> suppose i installed the nvidia current
[11:23] <david__> to see if it saves on reboot
[11:23] <david__> sorry dr willis
[11:23] <david__> if i seem kinda brain dead
[11:23] <david__> about linux
[11:23] <david__> :x
[11:23] <nicolenicole> does ClamAV ever give false positives?  or if it says something is malware, I should take its word and quarantine/delete it?
[11:23] <david__> im learning
[11:23] <david__> :P
[11:23] <dr_willis> nicolenicole:  any AV scanner can give false positives
[11:23] <dr_willis> id say EVERY scanner can give false positives. ;)
[11:24] <nicolenicole> how do I find out whether it is a false positive?  I tried googling the scan results but can't find descriptions
=== Guest64893 is now known as marc0w
[11:24] <dr_willis> scan with other AV software - see if some others say its malware or not.
=== fisted is now known as fisted_
[11:24] <dr_willis> id say it depends on what its reporting also. ;)
[11:25] <nicolenicole> all the results begin with PUA.Win32.Packer."" with "" being different names
[11:25] <dr_willis> could be its some generic self extacting/self modifing executable.
[11:25] <nicolenicole> what other scanner can I use on Ubuntu for scanning a directory with Windows software?
[11:25] <Kowalczyk> hi. im gonn a try setup a XEN server at work. and using ubuntu server. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen is this page viable? I tried this at home on a laptop and had trouble. couldnt vnc into it when I started the install. so I just wonder if this page is ok to use?
[11:25] <dr_willis> theres online av scanner sites also
[11:26] <dr_willis> first google hit for PAU.win32.packer - is 'clamav and ....'   http://forums.clamwin.com/viewtopic.php?t=3600
[11:26] <Kowalczyk> and is it okay to use 12.04 LTS or should I move on to 12.10?
[11:27] <nicolenicole> what I found on Google is that it is very common to hide trojans inside the "packers" so it may be a false positive, but I'd rather not risk it if I don't have to
[11:27] <cfhowlett> Kowalczyk: if you're a developer and you NEED the latest, greatest shiny version of stuff, then upgrade.
[11:27] <cfhowlett> Kowalczyk: 12.04 has 5 years of support, 12.10 has 18 months support.
[11:27] <nicolenicole> the files themselves are two EXE files and two CAB files, so they're important but if I execute them, might do damage if its infected
[11:27] <Kowalczyk> no.. I just work at IT. gonna make my servers into virtual servers instead.
[11:27] <Kowalczyk> instead of having a lot of them. just fileservers and stuff
[11:28] <Kowalczyk> but that page is okay to use? the wiki page at ubuntu?
[11:28] <dr_willis> nicolenicole:  first hit  (i posted) says PAU is broken..
[11:28] <cfhowlett> Kowalczyk: so this will be for work usage?  I'd highly recommend LTS then.
[11:28] <Kowalczyk> yes... it will
[11:28] <Kowalczyk> work usage + learning myself
[11:28] <nicolenicole> what is PUA?
[11:28] <cfhowlett> Kowalczyk: I'm only a desktop user and can't address server issues.  Ask in this channel again or check in with #ubuntu-server
[11:29] <cfhowlett> nicolenicole: PickUpArtist?
[11:29] <dr_willis> nicolenicole:    http://forums.clamwin.com/viewtopic.php?t=3600   it says what it is right there.
[11:29] <Kowalczyk> ok. will follow that guide and see if I get it to work this time
[11:29] <dr_willis> PUA detection (Potentially Unwanted Applications) is for detecting files that are packed with packers used by malware or tools that could be used by malware (
[11:29] <cfhowlett> Kowalczyk: have fun, be safe.
[11:29] <dr_willis> It detects packer type apps..
[11:29] <nicolenicole> @Kowalczyk there is some Ubuntu repository programs that no longer work in 12.04, best to upgrade if possible if you don't want to worry about compatibility
[11:30] <dr_willis> that thread is a great example of why to not use 'leet' speek also. ;) the question is barely understandable.. but the answer is clear.
[11:30] <Kowalczyk> nicolenicole: ok... will try 12.10 then.
[11:31] <nicolenicole> I'm going through the forum links, just a sec, thanx for the acronym on PUA
[11:33] <nicolenicole> Can I use Microsoft's MSERT.exe application to double-check ClamAV for Windows software?
[11:34] <nicolenicole> and what is the ClamWin they discuss, does that application not use the PUA identities then?
[11:35] <dr_willis> PAU detect PAU type apps.. and a lot of legit apps use the PAU type features..
[11:36] <dr_willis> PUA. :)

[11:37] <statusfailed> Does anyone know of an easy way to get ghc 7.6 running on Ubuntu?
[11:38] <nicolenicole> what's an alternate Ubuntu scanner I can use to double-check the ClamAv results?
[11:38] <statusfailed> I'm on 12.04.1
[11:38] <dr_willis> avast and avg had linux scanners last i looked..but that was years ago
[11:39] <dr_willis> theres online/web/java based av scanners also
[11:39] <dr_willis> some AV makers have linux based Live CD's also for scanning
[11:39] <nicolenicole> I'd rather not load into WINE an EXE scanner to check other EXE files for viruses, seems messy
[11:39] <dr_willis> some of the AV makers have linux native apps.
[11:40] <nicolenicole> I just want to quickly scan a single directory
[11:40] <dr_willis> id look for an online scanner.
[11:40] <nicolenicole> you have a link?
[11:40] <dr_willis> nope.
[11:40] <dr_willis> not used an av scanner in years. ;)

[11:47] <cfhowlett> arabi: cloned display or extended display?  Check your settings.
[11:47] <arabi> how can I know that? cfhowlett
[11:48] <arabi> nicolenicole,  the mirror option I can;t edit :(
[11:48] <nicolenicole> it is most likely extended, you have to change your display settings
[11:48] <cfhowlett> arabi: I THINK f1 brings up your display settings
[11:48] <arabi> It is inactive
[11:48] <dr_willis> calibri:  you need to specify what it is you re trying to do.. Ive no idea what you want to acomplish

[11:49] <MonkeyDust> calibri  it says here: GNUPGP (a post from 2006)
[11:49] <arabi> cfhowlett, nicolenicole  I can;t find extend option there... there is mirror but it can't be edited .. it is inactive sorry :(
[11:50] <nicolenicole> you should turn mirror on if you want the same screen on both monitors
[11:50] <cfhowlett> arabi: a bit different from me as I'm on xubuntu.  so you only have extended.  OK.  Use that as an extra display
[11:50] <nicolenicole> I'm on Ubuntu Xubuntu Studio lol
[11:50] <arabi> nicolenicole, but It can't be edited...  it is inactive...

[11:51] <nicolenicole> what shows on your primary monitor?
[11:51] <arabi> yes I have
[11:52] <tightwork> ugh and it begins

[11:52] <arabi> is that a problem?
[11:52] <nicolenicole> it could be a driver or graphics issue if the computer won't let you mirror, dunno what would cause that though, try logging out and back in and see if it fixes itself with the new monitor
[11:52] <cfhowlett> arabi: could be.
[11:53] <nicolenicole> Unity is terrible, I would strongly suggest using gnome-session-fallback

[11:54] <arabi> nicolenicole, is there anyway to fix this?
[11:54] <nicolenicole> I don't know, maybe your graphics driver won't allow you to mirror your desktop
[11:55] <cfhowlett> arabi: any activity on the EXTENDED desktop?
[11:55] <nicolenicole> seems odd though, you'd think it would be more difficult to extend rather than mirror

[12:01] <ameeth> hi i have ubuntu12.10 distro , has  gstreamer1.0 -multiverse packages
[12:01] <iceroot> ameeth: what is your question?
[12:01] <cfhowlett> ameeth: and?
[12:01] <BlackDalek> Can anyone help me with making a launcher icon for this? - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2102298
[12:02] <ameeth> is my distro contains gstreamer1.0 multiverse packages
[12:02] <calibri> ans pls...
[12:04] <iceroot> ameeth: packages.ubuntu.com there you can search for packages and also which package-version is in which ubuntu-release
[12:04] <nicolenicole> haha I had nothing better to do than click a link... :-p
[12:05] <nicolenicole> @BlackDalek
[12:10] <crazyhorse18> hey i'm on server a.. and i have a big string that i need to shove into a file on server b
[12:10] <tightwork> ugh this is terrible
[12:10] <crazyhorse18> like several pages with all sorts of special characters
[12:10] <crazyhorse18> any idea what command i can use?
[12:11] <daviddoria> I have two monitors. When I set them up in Display Settings to be side by side (one of them "Left Of" the other), everything works as I'd expect. After clicking "Apply", I click "Save as default". However, when I restart, it goes back to cloning them (the same thing is on both screens). Is there a different way I am supposed to save this setting?
[12:11] <cfhowlett> crazyhorse18: maybe ask in #ubuntu-server
[12:11] <crazyhorse18> cfhowlett: yeah i'll wait a bit but it's just a standard nix question
[12:13] <dr_willis> crazyhorse18:  the answer always seem to be creative use of sed/awk/perl and ssh ;)
[12:13]  * crazyhorse18 crys
[12:14] <dr_willis> You  expected a large sort of vague question to have a concise answer? like 'use the wput command' ?
[12:14] <crazyhorse18> yeah like
[12:14] <dr_willis> how big is big :) 1mb? 1TB?
[12:14] <dr_willis> you can do fancy pipes with ssh.
[12:15] <crazyhorse18> git clone --make-the-fucker-pipe-to-standard-out whatever  was what i was hoping
[12:15] <crazyhorse18> i tried 2>&1 but then my client side app no longer picks up when it's failing
[12:15] <crazyhorse18> i.e. no error event gets triggered if i pipe everything into stdout
[12:15] <dr_willis> crazyhorse18:  dirty trick.. :) use sshfs to mount the remote system to a local directory.. then act on it as if it was a local file.... ;P
[12:16] <BlackDalek> how do I make a launcher icon start a program as though it is starting from a user shell?
[12:16] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  make the launcher run  somthing like 'xterm -e commandtorun' perhaps.
[12:17] <dr_willis> if thats what you mean.
[12:18] <Tex_Nick> crazyhorse18 : would something work tar -cvzf data_folder | ssh remote_host ‘( cd ~/mybackup_dir;
[12:18] <Tex_Nick> tar -xvzf )’
[12:18] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, I am not sure what I mean, but this is what I am trying to achieve - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2102298 ;)
[12:18] <dr_willis> david__:  yes. im here. ;) no need to msg me.
[12:18] <Tex_Nick> something like this *
[12:19] <david__> o ok
[12:19] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  from what ive seen a bash script ran from a launcher gets the same enviroment/settings as ran from the shell.
[12:19] <crazyhorse18> hmm yeah but i have it in a string
[12:19] <david__> well im trying to setup that script
[12:19] <crazyhorse18> what about something like echo “#{file_content}” > blabla
[12:20] <crazyhorse18> and i just make sure i escape everything in file_content
[12:20] <david__> but i followed all the steps and its not working :(
[12:20] <dr_willis> crazyhorse18:  unless its over the bash command line size limit.
[12:20] <crazyhorse18> hmmm.. i'm running the commands over ssh
[12:20] <crazyhorse18> i'm not sure if i'm even using a shell
[12:21] <crazyhorse18> i.e. i'm calling channel.exec  (where channel is the ssh channel)
[12:21] <dr_willis> david__:  a simple 2 line script in  ~/.config/autostart/razersetup.sh   with 2 lines like   #!/bin/bash   razercfg --whateveryourioptionsare
[12:21] <dr_willis> ssh channel?
[12:21] <crazyhorse18> dr_willis: so maybies.. i haz no limits :)
[12:21] <dr_willis> bash has a limit on the legenth of a single command.
[12:21] <crazyhorse18> yeah... a single ssh connection consists of multiple channels
[12:21] <crazyhorse18> so you can run crap in parallel
[12:22] <dr_willis> cant say ive ever used that feature. ;)
[12:22] <crazyhorse18> i'm using an appliction library to connect
[12:23] <JohnFlux> on bugs.ubuntu.com is there any way to delete comment?
[12:24] <JohnFlux> linkedin has sent an "invite" to all my bugs !
[12:24] <crazyhorse18> dr_willis: ah yeah, i'm not using a shell.. to do that you have to do somthing tricky like session.shell.open and pass it a bunch of opts
[12:24] <crazyhorse18> so hopefully ssh is not going to care
[12:24] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, here is my launcher icon contents - http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1506494/ - does anything there stand out blindingly obvious as being wrong?
[12:25] <JohnFlux> I see a "hide comment" option - does that hide it for everyone?
[12:25] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  i tend to just make bash scripts to launch things.. then make a launcher that runs the bash script. ;)
[12:26] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:   try it and see if it works. if you use the terminal=true i think it opens a term window  and may show any errors
[12:26] <Ronalds_M> hello everyone, how to get older flash version in Ubuntu 12.04, cause my PC is not supported by 11.2
[12:27] <dr_willis> cant say ive ever heard of a pc not being supported by flash.
[12:27] <dr_willis> clarify what you mean by that
[12:28] <Ronalds_M> I have one core AMD athlon
[12:28] <dr_willis> the flash/adobe site may have older versions archived somewhere.
[12:28] <Ronalds_M> on windows xp, newest flash doesn't works
[12:28] <Ronalds_M> and in ubuntu it surely doesn't works
[12:28] <MonkeyDust> windows xp?
[12:28] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, I tried with terminal=true... never got any errors. Where do I find info on how to make a bash script?
[12:28] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  #!/bin/bash    then commandstorun ;)

[12:29] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  its possible the java game needs to be started from within the directory where the game is at.
[12:30] <Ronalds_M> I just installed ubuntu, PC was slow with unity, so I installed XFCE, but installing official flash with many methods, doesn't work
[12:30] <dr_willis> cd /whever/the/jarisat

[12:36] <MonkeyDust> raven  avconv
[12:37] <raven> bekks easytag is only able to edid the main tags right?
[12:37] <bekks> raven: Which other tags do you want to edit then, in detail?
[12:39] <lahire> #agenux
[12:39] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, you are correct... from a terminal, if I do "java -jar /home/dalek/Wordbiz/wordbiz.jar" it fails but if I do "cd WordBiz/ ; java -jar wordbiz.jar" then it works.
[12:41] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, so I need to learn how to write a bash script which will do those two commands? Or is there a better way?
[12:41] <blami> BlackDalek: seems like the wordbiz.jar uses other jars in that directory, setting jvm classpath could help
[12:42] <blami> BlackDalek: in case it uses files directly from same directory there's no other way than cd to its directory ... you can wrap it into bash script that does exactly that.
[12:43] <BlackDalek> I've never made a bash script before...
[12:44] <raven> bekks i have a preproduced radio program of on hour length with music in it and i need to tag the music in it - its one big file and i need to change the tags every few minutes

[12:45] <Ronalds_M> where I should put libflashplayer.so, to make flash run
[12:46] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  in the time its taken you to ask.. :) you could have allready made such a script
[12:46] <raven> cfhowlett there i can do text-tracks but they are not exported as id3tags
[12:46] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  3 lines. #!/bin/bash          cd /whaever/      java -jar whatever

[13:24] <dr_willis> theos:  set them both to use Pulse audio perhaps?
[13:24] <mladoux> dr_willis, just what I was thinking, or some other multi-io audio library
[13:25] <mladoux> sounds like he's using alsa or oss
[13:25] <dr_willis> that like one of the main goals/features of using pulse
[13:25] <theos> alsa yes :D
[13:25] <blami> theos: that's pulse vs alsa conflict
[13:25] <theos> we dont need no alsa?
[13:25] <blami> we need
[13:25] <dr_willis> Pulse uses alsa. ;)
[13:25] <theos> oh...
[13:25] <blami> it's backend for pulse
[13:25] <mladoux> yeah, alsa doesn't do that, you need pulse to interface with it so that you can have multiple streams
[13:25] <philsf> I was having problems with the default kernel in 12.04 with my wifi adapter in my netbook (ath9k driver), where every now and them the driver would barf, the device would be unavailble and I had to reboot.

Should I still report a bug for the 3.2 kernel?
[13:25]  * theos is confused
[13:25] <llutz> raven: http://id3v2-chap-tool.sourceforge.net/
[13:25] <blami> best solution is to set alsa default output to pulse input sink
[13:26] <dr_willis> apps --> pulse --> alsa --> your speakers
[13:26] <mladoux> theos, think of pulse like a virtual dsp, that then mixes all the input streams together into a single output.
[13:26] <blami> then everything trying to play sound using alsa will use pulse
[13:26] <theos> aha! let me see. thanks
[13:26] <mladoux> alsa being the output
[13:26] <raven> llutz tnx for the hint ill look at it
[13:26] <blami> theos: having that nice diagram that dr_willis kindly  provided you want
[13:27] <blami> theos: apps --> alsa --> pulse --> alsa --> speakers
[13:27] <dr_willis> with a little loop-de-loop :)
[13:27] <blami> theos: in case apps doesn't support pulse directly (which may be case of flash, don't know)
[13:28] <mladoux> so rather than send all the audio streams to alsa, you send them to pulse, which mixes them together into a single stream and sends them to alsa ( which can only handle one stream at a time ) as a combined stream that alsa can handle.
[13:29] <mladoux> blami i think there are hooks for that.
[13:30] <blami> mladoux: hook is alsa output that just proxies to pulse and then back again to alsa
[13:31] <blami> mladoux: one can easily check if this one is efective by running alsamixer
[13:31] <blami> mladoux: if there is just one control called pulse
[13:31] <theos> how to do this? <blami> best solution is to set alsa default output to pulse input sink
[13:32] <Robbilie> hm
[13:34] <theos> all those input output input thingy got me confused :D
[13:34] <blami> theos: not sure about way supported by ubuntu officialy but I have /etc/asoundrc with following contents: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1506653/
[13:35] <Virunga> Hi, i have an ubuntu server with multiple network interfaces. When i do telnet 192.168.15.10 which is the ip of one interface, says connection refused. Is it correct? I didn't set any firewall or whatever. Could you help me, please?
[13:36] <mladoux> Virunga does telnet work on any of the other interfaces? Also, have you enabled telnet, I believe it's off by default.
[13:36] <llutz> Virunga: sudo lsof -i :23           does telnetd listen on that iface/ip at all?
[13:36] <theos> blami you mean asound.conf?

[13:38] <Virunga> mladoux: it didn't work on the other interface either :/
[13:38] <Virunga> llutz: i did that command and returned nothing
[13:38] <mladoux> that means telnet isn't enabled
[13:39] <llutz> Virunga: so no telnetd at all listening

[13:40] <mladoux> you could ping the server

[14:05] <stPundit> thanks guys !!
[14:05] <und3rgr0undz3r0> hey, I need some help with my gui
[14:06] <stPundit> can you be specific ? und3rgr0undz3r0
[14:07] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I'm logged in under my installation in CLI using IRSSI. When my gui boots I have about 60 seconds before my system freezes. At first I thougth it was the GPU but I have Nvidia drivers installed for my 8600 GT and Its still freezing after boot.
[14:08] <adamk> und3rgr0undz3r0: So it freezes whether you are using the nvidia drivers or the nouveau drivers?
[14:08] <adamk> Have you run memtest on your system?
[14:09] <und3rgr0undz3r0> adamk: yeah, at first I thought it was Nouveau drivers but still happens after installing Nvidia drivers
[14:09] <und3rgr0undz3r0> adamk: no, I have not run memtest
[14:09] <und3rgr0undz3r0> adamk: what would memtest do for me?
[14:10] <bekks> und3rgr0undz3r0: It will test your memory, as the name suggests.
[14:11] <iceroot> und3rgr0undz3r0: you had a look at /var/log/syslog?
[14:11] <und3rgr0undz3r0> bekks: I don't think its memory, because I can run it like I am now in CLI mode for as long as I want with no hangups.
[14:11] <und3rgr0undz3r0> iceroot, no, will that be able to tell me what is causing hangups?
[14:11] <iceroot> und3rgr0undz3r0: maybe
[14:12] <iceroot> und3rgr0undz3r0: its always a good place to have a look when facing issues like that
[14:12] <und3rgr0undz3r0> iceroot: How do I view it from the command line?
[14:13] <dr_willis> fan is running on the video card?  and other fans all running also?
[14:13] <und3rgr0undz3r0> dr_willis: all fans connected are running, gpu showing to run about 68 degrees at max temp
[14:13] <dr_willis> cat /var/log/syslog  or you could install ssh, and ssh into the box. and tail -f /var/log/syslog and  then start the gui and watchit crash
[14:14] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I'll go check out Syslog
[14:14] <dr_willis> testing with some live cd's and other differnt disrtos may give some clues also - If they ALL fail the same way that would sort of point to a hardware issue.
[14:15] <dr_willis> if some work. that would point to a driver/kernel/os issue
[14:15] <und3rgr0undz3r0> Ubuntu live CD and Mint live cd crash if I don't blacklist nouveau drivers
[14:15] <und3rgr0undz3r0> if I blacklist them on boot, they run just fine
[14:15] <dr_willis> novuveau drivers dont work on the install however?
[14:16] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I've tried to edit boot script on the installed OS, I change where it says "quiet splash" and replace it with nouveau.blacklist=1
[14:16] <und3rgr0undz3r0> but then it still freezes, im ripping my hair out trying to get this under control
[14:17] <und3rgr0undz3r0> if Steam for Linux can run my games on here, then windows is GONE
[14:17] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I just need to get a bootable GUI
[14:18] <dr_willis> steam only has some games for linux.
[14:18] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I own most of them

[14:18] <und3rgr0undz3r0> the Login screen will be completely responsive until I login
[14:18] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I can sit at the login screen for hours if I wanted
[14:18] <Robbilie> und3rgr0undz3r0, i once had the same issue
[14:19] <Robbilie> i had the wrong video driver
[14:19] <dr_willis> try a differnt window manager.. like lxde/lubuntu-desktop    Its sounding more like a driver/compiz issue
[14:19] <wilfredh> apt-get is giving me `INFO: using unsupported version '/usr/bin/python2.7'` when /usr/bin/python, /usr/bin/python2, /etc/alternatives/python and /etc/alternatives/python2 all point to 2.6. Any idea where the relevant apt-get setting is?
[14:19] <und3rgr0undz3r0> I have Xfce, Gnome and Unity installed , dr_willis
[14:19] <Robbilie> und3rgr0undz3r0, try to remove/reconfigure xorg
[14:19] <Robbilie> *xorg.conf
[14:20] <dr_willis> try jwm  :)
[14:20] <und3rgr0undz3r0> Robbilie: I have know idea how to edit that configuration file
[14:20] <dr_willis> login screen uses X also.. so somthing seems very weird.
[14:20] <Robbilie> und3rgr0undz3r0, i simply removed it and rebootet
[14:20] <und3rgr0undz3r0> it will replace itself?
[14:21] <Robbilie> dr_willis, this didnt make sense for me, you are right
[14:21] <dr_willis> X auto configures for the most part. I dont have an xorg.conf
[14:21] <Robbilie> dr_willis, but it worked
[14:21] <und3rgr0undz3r0> Robbilie: how do I delete xorg.conf
[14:21] <Robbilie> und3rgr0undz3r0, did it ever work or just changed smthng
[14:21] <und3rgr0undz3r0> Robbilie: this is a fresh installation
[14:21] <Robbilie> und3rgr0undz3r0, so open source video driver?
[14:22] <dr_willis> a fresh install that youve been trying all sorts of drivers on.
[14:22] <und3rgr0undz3r0> Robbilie: dr_willis: I have installed nvidia-current via apt get
[14:22] <iceroot> und3rgr0undz3r0: less /var/log/syslog
[14:22] <Robbilie> dr_willis, und3rgr0undz3r0 thats the fail xD
[14:22] <Robbilie> this was my fault too
[14:22] <und3rgr0undz3r0> and I installed one from nvidia.com using wget and running the script
[14:22] <Robbilie> they dont work correctly
[14:23] <Robbilie> i needed to purge all x drivers and such and i am not really sure what it did finally xD
[14:23] <greyduck> Real noob question comming up
[14:23] <Robbilie> ? xD
[14:23] <und3rgr0undz3r0> Robbilie: should I try to delete my xorg.conf?
[14:24] <dr_willis> und3rgr0undz3r0:  removeing the xorg.conf is a trivial thing to try.
[14:24] <Robbilie> yes it helped for me
[14:24] <und3rgr0undz3r0> iceroot: Totally gonna check that out too
[14:24] <Robbilie> and remove the nvidia drivers from command line
[14:24] <greyduck> When i try and leave the room a message appears stating: you have unread messages?

[14:30] <greyduck> thanks for the help dr_willis
[14:30] <Eagleman> ikonia i mean, port 25 is used between MTA to MTA and not for users to MSA, however i am able to use users to MSA on port 25, is there a way to disable that?
[14:31] <ikonia> Eagleman: that is a terrible idea,
[14:31] <boulderdave> jb
[14:31] <ikonia> Eagleman: the MTA authentication depends on your mail server, so basically just set users to "null" or none,

[15:17] <vlt> Hello. How can I load aes_x86_64 in initrd on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with the default 3.2.0 kernel?
[15:17] <TomyLaptop> if i wanted to run a script every X startup, where would i put it?
[15:18] <vlt> TomyLaptop: rc.local
[15:18] <djono> hello can anyone help me with a problem with a hex editor?
[15:18] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, in the launchlist
[15:18] <TomyLaptop> vlt, user-specific
[15:18] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, are you in unity?
[15:18] <TomyLaptop> no
[15:18] <Robbilie> but?
[15:18] <TomyLaptop> kde
[15:19] <jrib> TomyLaptop: X being a number?
[15:19] <TomyLaptop> X being X
[15:19] <Robbilie> xD
[15:19] <TomyLaptop> X server
[15:19] <jrib> TomyLaptop: what kind of script?
[15:19] <TomyLaptop> a bash script
[15:19] <jrib> what does it do...?
[15:19] <TomyLaptop> stuff
[15:19] <Robbilie> more than irrelevant xD
[15:19] <jrib> ok well put it in place I guess.
[15:19] <sleepy-sleepy> ...
[15:20] <TomyLaptop> well, which place? :)
[15:20] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, gnome-session-properties
[15:20] <Robbilie> just enter in terminal
[15:20] <jrib> TomyLaptop: honestly the best place depends on what it does
[15:20] <TomyLaptop> it does something that needs X
[15:21] <TomyLaptop> autodetect and set up display
[15:21] <jrib> TomyLaptop: ok well try the suggestion given to you.  You're being too vague
[15:21] <jonah_> tarelerulz: I watch Netflix on Ubuntu using Vmware player with an old windows installation on there, runs really well on my second monitor while i work using ubuntu on my first screen
[15:21] <Robbilie> jrib, is my post the correct way?
[15:22] <jrib> Robbilie: yeah, that's a good way to start up an application when a user logs in to a "nice" desktop environment
[15:22] <Robbilie> jrib, "nice" :D whats a "not nice" one? :D
[15:22] <hamstermar> hi i m new on gaming i want ask why i cant play CS:S on my ubuntu
[15:22] <jrib> Robbilie: by "nice" I mean one that respects xdg and will run ~/.config/autostart
[15:22] <TomyLaptop> because it's a windows game. next.
[15:22] <TomyLaptop> :D
[15:22] <djono> is anyone good at hex editing
[15:23] <TomyLaptop> try playonlinux.comnetorg
[15:23] <jrib> djono: you need to be more specific.  What is your support isuse?
[15:23] <sleepy-sleepy> Haha tomy
[15:23] <Robbilie> jrib, makes sense
[15:23] <hamstermar> i NOWWWWWW I INSTALL WINE AND AND I TRIED VBOX but NO DRIVERS WORKING ON MY UBUNTU
[15:23] <djono> every time i try to copy the hex editor just closes and dies
[15:24] <Robbilie> hamstermar, stop shouting :D
[15:24] <hamstermar> ok
[15:24] <TomyLaptop> Robbilie, gnome-session-properties is from the gnome-session-bin package. i don't have that and considering i'm not using gnome, i don't want it either.
[15:24] <Robbilie> i guess css will be ported by valve
[15:24] <djono> im using bless hex editor
[15:24] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, well not only gnome uses it but also unity :D
[15:25] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, i guess there are several others ;)
[15:25] <TomyLaptop> tf2 is already ported. doesnt work for me though, but that might be due to stupid optimus
[15:25] <Robbilie> hamstermar, but there might be linux version for this already...
[15:25] <Robbilie> and vm doesnt work?
[15:25] <hamstermar> look all wath i want now if there is any way to install my graphical card drivers on ubuntu
[15:25] <TomyLaptop> Robbilie, gnome, unity, what's the difference? i use kde
[15:25] <TomyLaptop> hamstermar, card brand?
[15:25] <Robbilie> hamstermar, what gpu do you have?
[15:26] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, right, let me search
[15:26] <djono> any ideas?
=== \sw is now known as sw
[15:26] <hamstermar> NVIDIA
[15:26] <sleepy-sleepy> Model?
[15:26] <TomyLaptop> hamstermar, nvidia optimus involved?
[15:26] <one> can i get a wireshark tutorial?
[15:26] <hamstermar> GT-X 19906VBX-55
[15:27] <sleepy-sleepy> One, xheck youtube plenty of wireshark stuff their
[15:27] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, i guess hte idea of /etc/rc.local is best then
[15:27] <sleepy-sleepy> *check
[15:27] <Robbilie> one, google that :D
[15:27] <TomyLaptop> Robbilie, hmm i really wanted it to be user-specific though
[15:27] <serhat> does anyone know how to file a bug report?
[15:27] <one> sleepy,thanks,.,.,
[15:28] <sleepy-sleepy> No prob mang
[15:28] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, you mean with gui? or one for each user?
[15:28] <bekks> hamstermar: Please pastebin the output of "lspci".
[15:28] <Robbilie> one, sry but i think thats not that ubuntu related ;)
[15:28] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=100756
[15:28] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, the third post seems like user specific
[15:29] <mikeW68> I hope someone has an answer. I'm not sure what happened but my password no longer works. I tried to sudo and won't accept my password. I have auto login on so I can log in but when I try to change my password it won't accept it. Ubuntu 12.10
=== adamxx is now known as adamx
[15:30] <TomyLaptop> meh, that's kde-specific. if i change my window manager it breaks
[15:30] <mikeW68> I have booted into "safe mode" used passwd "username" and it doesn't prompt for new password
[15:30] <TomyLaptop> isnt there something like .Xrc or something?
[15:30] <markovh> does ubuntu encourage screnshots of commandline tools? screenshots.ubuntu.com
[15:30] <bohm> Hello, is it possible to disable the middle-click window-resizing circle in 12.10? Using CCSM maybe? I couldn't find the option name. Since I'm using a touchpad, I click with three fingers quite often.
[15:30] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, would you be so kind to mention ALL requirements :P
[15:31] <TomyLaptop> 1. runs every time i log in (but not anyone else) 2. requires no admin rights to maintain 3. is WM-agnostic
[15:32] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, i have a script called .xinitrc in my home dir...?
[15:32] <djono> does anyone know how to stop bless hex editor from closing after trying to copy
[15:32] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, whereas this only contains #! /bin/bash \n startfluxbox
[15:33] <Robbilie> djono, i personally use and recommend ghex :)
[15:33] <Geet> have some of the visual effects in 12.04 or 11.10 been removed in 12.10? like when i used to change workspace using shortcut keys the sliding effect was shown but when i used a live usb 12.10 the effects were not there. only four workspaces were shown in the middle of the screen.
[15:33] <mikeW68> need help resetting a password
[15:33] <one> hello.,.,.,.???any body there???
[15:33] <hamstermar> djono try geany hex editore is good with terminal access
[15:34] <jrib> !password | mikeW68
[15:34] <ubottu> mikeW68: Forgot your password? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
[15:34] <Robbilie> mikeW68, i usually boot as root in grub and then change it
[15:34] <djono> does it have a file size limit?
[15:34] <TomyLaptop> Robbilie, hmm .xinitrc is one of the names i tried. didnt work. will put some diagnostics into it
[15:34] <TomyLaptop> does it need +x or #!/...?
[15:34] <mikeW68> I've tried, when I use passwd username nothing happens
[15:34] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, let me see
[15:35] <jrib> TomyLaptop: try ~/.xprofile or ~/.xsessionrc (some of these may be outdated though)
[15:35] <Robbilie> TommehM, -rwxrwxr-x
[15:35] <Robbilie> ups
[15:35] <TomyLaptop> trying .xprofile, brb
[15:35] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop,  -rwxrwxr-x
[15:36] <hamstermar> mike try to boot on backtrack as a live CD the use john the unshadow it and crackit
[15:36] <hamstermar> mikeW68 try to boot on backtrack as a live CD the use john the unshadow it and crackit
[15:36] <hamstermar> unshadow /etc/shadow /etc/passwd > hash.txt
[15:36] <Robbilie> mikeW68, the way i suggested is the same as ubottu suggested
[15:36] <djono> well ghex wont even open my file
[15:36] <hamstermar> then ./john hash.txt
[15:37] <jrib> mikeW68: "nothing happens" means it worked
[15:37] <mikeW68> No when I type passwd "username" it should prompt for new passwd?
[15:37] <jrib> mikeW68: yes
[15:37] <djono> i guess ghex has a file size limit
[15:38] <mikeW68> that's just it, it doesn't. Only reason I can login is because I have autologin set.
[15:38] <Robbilie> mikeW68, no xD type passwd mikeW68 for example
[15:38] <jrib> mikeW68: so what happens when you type "passwd username" in recovery mode?
[15:38] <mikeW68> same thing just goes back to prompt.
[15:38] <Robbilie> and you booted into root mode for sure?
[15:39] <mikeW68> how do I know for sure, I went into recovery move, then "mount -o remount,rw /"
[15:39] <AndreiCurelaru> screen
[15:39] <jrib> mikeW68: that's pretty strange passwd behavior
[15:40] <hamstermar> did you try john the ripper passoword cracker for linux try to boot up backtrack live cd and decrypte the password hash ,mikeW68
[15:40] <TomyLaptop> .xsessionrc worked :)
[15:40] <Robbilie> TomyLaptop, gratz :)
[15:40] <TomyLaptop> (kubuntu 12.04)
[15:40] <bazhang> hamstermar, thats not good advice
[15:40] <hamstermar> using Unshadow
[15:40] <hamstermar> why
[15:40] <poq> Hi all. Does any printable info exist which could mean that my OS is legal?
[15:40] <zwirc> Hi, i did a sql dump, but where did it save itself?
[15:40] <hamstermar> if she could help
[15:40] <djono> does anyone know the file size limit for ghex
[15:40] <mikeW68> hamstermar no but I can
[15:40] <bazhang> hamstermar, this is ubuntu not backtrack
[15:40] <jrib> zwirc: depends on what you ran
[15:40] <Robbilie> hamstermar, because there are more useful and easier  methods
[15:41] <sgtkilljoy> wats the dpkg reconfigure option?
[15:41] <hamstermar> i now but just .... help
[15:41] <jrib> mikeW68: you could edit shadow and place the hash of a password you know.  But honestly, I would debug the strange passwd behavior instead
[15:41] <mathnode> poq: What OS? Ubuntu?
[15:41] <chris154> Hi i have a quick question about dual booting can i have Win 7 and Ubuntu dual boot but on seperate drives?
[15:41] <bazhang> hamstermar, are you using backtrack?
[15:41] <poq> mathnode: Ubuntu and Lubuntu
[15:41] <jrib> sgtkilljoy: dpkg-reconfigure?
[15:41] <mathnode> poq: Legal in what way? The license they use?
[15:41] <mikeW68> jrib: how do I do that
[15:41] <hamstermar> nn i use to use it on vbox
[15:41] <SonikkuAmerica> chris154: Yes
[15:42] <jrib> mikeW68: why do you need to change your password?
[15:42] <hamstermar> it realy usuful
[15:42] <mikeW68> because I can't sudo
[15:42] <Robbilie> for mentioning backtrack so often i got muted yesterday xD
[15:42] <jrib> mikeW68: did you forget your password?
[15:42] <chris154> SonikkuAmerica: How would i do it cause at the moment with both installed it always boots 7 no option for ubuntu
[15:42] <mikeW68> no I was setting up Samba so I could wifi to my dlna device
[15:42] <mikeW68> then bam no sudo
[15:42] <serhat> chris154, that would be about your bios
[15:42] <poq> mathnode: I need that info to show it to some stupid instances of policemans to make them believe that my OS and soft are ok
[15:42] <sgtkilljoy> jrib: ty, was using space :P
[15:43] <TomyLaptop> poq, ubuntu is free open source software. the only licenses you need are automatically granted to you by the authors. if you want to read them, i'm sure there's something on ubuntu.com
[15:43] <jrib> mikeW68: what did "setting up Samba" entail?
[15:43] <SonikkuAmerica> chris154, how do you plan to install it, Wubi or separate?
[15:43] <philinux> mikeW68: have a read here.  > http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[15:43] <chris154> SonikkuAmerica: Seperate
[15:43] <hamstermar> like i said the best think is unshadow the /etc/shadow file from a backtrack live cd,mikeW68 on crack the hash using john the ripper
[15:43] <mathnode> poq: of course it's legal, it's GNU GPL.
[15:43] <bazhang> hamstermar, thats not the best way. stop suggesting it
[15:44] <jrib> hamstermar: 1) it doesn't seem like he forgot the password 2) just replacing the hash with the known hash of some known password would be faster
[15:44] <mathnode> poq: http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/licensing
[15:44] <Pici> poq: vrms can tell you what packages you have installed might or might not be GPL cpliant. Its not perfect though.
[15:44] <Pici> poq: *compliant
[15:44] <hamstermar> YES thah works to jrib
[15:44] <mikeW68> jrib: I grabbed the package, set the network name and set the video and music paths
[15:44] <TomyLaptop> wat, recovery mode has a "drop to root" option that works without a password? man that's too easy
[15:44] <dr_willis> 'you dident click on the eula! you going to jail!' ;)
[15:45] <mikeW68> I was going to grab another file when sudo stopped
[15:45] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  physical access to a machine implies very little security. :) keep your server room  doors locked.
[15:45] <philinux> mikeW68: have u seen this link > http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[15:45] <mikeW68> philinux going there now
[15:46] <SonikkuAmerica> chris154: If you're installing it separate, while Ubuntu is installing it should search for and find your Win7 drive with no problems. If it doesn't work, dig out your Live CD and run (or install) boot-repair. (pardon the long wait time, I'm typing this on my Android tablet)
[15:46] <jeremycook> Hey guys, I have a question about getting my laptop subwoofer working.
[15:46] <TomyLaptop> dr_willis, err, i'd still like my machine to be safe from a person without access to the BIOS setup or a screwdriver
[15:46] <chris154> SonikkuAmerica: Ok thanks for the help i think i know the isue it wasnt installed on this pc the drive has just been put in
[15:47] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  theres tools to do that. Just not by default.
[15:47] <jeremycook> I have an HP Envy 17 with a new install of Ubuntu 12.10. Everything works about from the subwoofer, which I can't get working at all.
[15:47] <mikeW68> ok, going to try what philinux has suggest, will report back.
[15:47] <evildmp> I have put something in /etc/rc.local, /usr/local/bin/uwsgi --emperor /etc/uwsgi/vassals --uid www-data --gid www-data - how can I make that kick off without rebooting the system?
[15:47] <dr_willis> TomyLaptop:  just dont for get your passwords :)
[15:47] <philinux> mikeW68: good luck
[15:47] <jeremycook> I've pretty much tried everything I could find on Google but was wondering if anyone had any other ideas.
[15:47] <dr_willis> evildmp:  just run the command...
[15:47] <SonikkuAmerica> chris154: What you should do though is NOT reinstall
[15:48] <dr_willis> evildmp:  sudo whatevercommnad &   and 'exit' the shell ;)
[15:48] <chris154> SonikkuAmerica: Ok thanks for the help ill try that
[15:48] <dr_willis> evildmp:  theres proberly some 'sudo service rc.local' you could run also. but that may be overkill
[15:48]  * SonikkuAmerica facepalms
[15:48] <evildmp> dr_willis: the command will run as sudo <whatever>?
=== Celene_away is now known as ClumsyFairyQueen
[15:49] <TomyLaptop> dr_willis, does that really work if the thing runs continuously?
[15:49] <dr_willis> evildmp:  rc.local runs as root yes.. unless you use a command to run it as a differnt user
[15:49] <SonikkuAmerica> chris154: Instead, unplug your Win7 hard drive...
=== jimerick1on is now known as jimerickson
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[15:49] <dr_willis> rc.local runs its commands at the end of the normal boot process.. its not really a service. its just a bit of a dirty work around place to put commands you dont want to make real service/upstart configs/scrpts for.
[15:50] <dr_willis> It would be a much better idea to make an actual upstart service.conf file for it.
[15:50] <evildmp> thanks dr_willis
[15:50] <SonikkuAmerica> chris154: start your computer with only the Ubuntu drive in, then plug in the Win7 hard drive and run [ sudo update-grub ] in a terminal.
[15:50] <dr_willis> Usage: /etc/init.d/rc.local start|stop
[15:51] <dr_willis> so 'sudo service rc.local start' would do it also.
[15:51] <TomyLaptop> SonikkuAmerica,  errr
[15:51] <evildmp> yeah, I found that after you pointed me at it, thanks
[15:52] <TomyLaptop> not even all sata drives are hotpluggable
[15:52] <TomyLaptop> they might fry
[15:52] <mikeW68> philinux, I had a chance to read the fil, unfortunatly none of those are my problem. It's not accepting my password. When I type sudo apt-get it prompts for password, I enter my password and it says sorry, try again
[15:52] <TomyLaptop> chris154 read my remark to SonikkuAmerica's proposal
[15:53] <philinux> mikeW68: maybe dr_willis can help you then.
[15:53] <SonikkuAmerica> Crap! He left....
[15:54] <hamstermar> xD dr_Willis now evry thing
[15:54] <mikeW68> dr_willis? is he a family Dr.? or a specialist? :-) sorry, couldn't resist
[15:54] <SonikkuAmerica> TomyLaptop: He left a loooooong time ago.

[15:59] <SonikkuAmerica> IDE is the only thing I've worked with till recently.
[15:59] <mikeW68> it does, but I can't for the life of me figure out how. I didn't do anything account related.
[16:02] <TomyLaptop> vlt, i have no clue of these things but if you havent looked into dkms yet, you should
[16:02] <mikeW68> is there a way to activate the root account in recovery so I can log in as root and try to fix this?

[16:05] <Lupin> Hey, I have a turntable that has a USB audio output cable. I've connected it to the laptop (12.10) and using pule audio volume control I can see it does recognise the input. However it won't route the sound back to my output (i.e I can't use speakers or headphones. even the inbuilt ones. Nothing comes out of it)
[16:05] <Lupin> Any ideas?
[16:05] <TomyLaptop> TommehM, you simply have the wrong name. he meant me
[16:05] <Robbilie> TommehM, sry was my fault
[16:05] <grizcreative> I have
[16:05] <mikeW68> tomylaptop yup tried that.
[16:06] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, do you have sudo access?
[16:06] <SonikkuAmerica> Lupin: A record player turntable?
[16:07] <Lupin> SonikkuAmerica: Yeah.
[16:07] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop, in what sense, I can type sudo but it won't accept my password after 3 tries it says 3 incorrect password attempt
[16:07] <philinux> mikeW68: so are u in the admin group?
[16:07] <Lupin> An ion profile pro.
[16:07] <mikeW68> philinux yup, in user accounts it shows me as administrator
[16:07] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, sudo wants YOUR password, not root's
[16:07] <Lupin> it doesn't work on my windows7 box either.
[16:08] <TomyLaptop> i'm assuming you have your own password :)
[16:08] <SonikkuAmerica> Lupin: Interesting... something I doubt we can troubleshoot though...
[16:08] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop, yup and that's what I'm entering
=== samir is now known as csgeek
[16:08] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, then how the heck do you log in?
[16:08] <SonikkuAmerica> Lupin: ...and I would think it came with a Win driver CD...
[16:08] <philinux> mikeW68: double check. cat /etc/group | grep admin
[16:08] <mikeW68> it autologins, but if I try to change users or logout I can't get back in unless I reboot
[16:09] <h0m1x> anyone there ?
[16:09] <h0m1x> I want someone to write me a regex pattern
[16:09] <h0m1x> I'm not good at regex
[16:09] <Lupin> Erhehe I don't have a cd drive, SonikkuAmerica  >.>
[16:09] <TomyLaptop> regex is fun, so i'm just going to ask 30€ per hour
[16:09] <h0m1x> href="file.php?id=8&k=f24f9"
[16:09] <Lupin> I'll have a go myself anyway. If not, I can just go get an RCA to 3.5mm adaptor or something
[16:10] <mikeW68> lpadmin:x:107:mike
[16:10] <philinux> mikeW68: soz wrong code cat /etc/group | grep adm
[16:10] <h0m1x> I want this part "f24f9"
[16:10] <SonikkuAmerica> Lupin: O.O That would be your best bet I would think.
[16:10] <philinux> ^^^
[16:10] <Pici> h0m1x: try #regex
[16:10] <h0m1x> TomyLaptop: How can I do it ?
[16:10] <TomyLaptop> www.regular-expression.info if you want to learn it
[16:10] <hamstermar> mike ok now use unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/passwd > hash.txt ; john hash.txt
[16:11] <vlt> vlt: /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
[16:11] <hamstermar> mike ok now use unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow  > hash.txt ; john hash.txt
[16:11] <hamstermar> srr
[16:11] <h0m1x> Pici: I tried
[16:11] <TomyLaptop> hamstermar, oh shut up
[16:11] <h0m1x> Pici: it seems no one answer
[16:12] <Lupin> SonikkuAmerica: Yeah. I'll sack it for now. Thanks anyway.
[16:12] <philinux> mikeW68: soz wrong code cat /etc/group | grep adm
[16:12] <llutz> philinux: better to use "getent group adm"  as some cat/grep
[16:12] <bekks> philinux: grep adm /etc/group
[16:12] <mikeW68> philinux does show I am in adm
[16:12] <mikeW68> adm:x:4:mike
[16:12] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, again: to even type sudo, you need to log in. how on earth do you log in without your password?
[16:13] <llutz> mikeW68: for sudo you need to be in "sudo" group (or admin, not adm)
[16:13] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop, like I said when I boot up it autologins to Ubuntu,
[16:13] <TomyLaptop> llutz, he said it doesnt accept his password
[16:13] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, ah i see. and you forgot what you entered back then?
[16:13] <zwirc> i ran mysqldump -t -u miner -p miner hawkeye
[16:13] <llutz> TomyLaptop: and? above still applies
[16:13] <zwirc> Where would that be saved? o.O
[16:14] <TheLordOfTime> zwirc, you'd also need to add a > to there, such that > /path/to/save/to.sql
[16:14] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop nope, I was logged it and it just stopped working. I haven't changed it
[16:14] <TheLordOfTime> at least usually
[16:14] <TomyLaptop> llutz, it's technically correct but not relevant
[16:14] <philinux> mikeW68: sounds like your password got change then and the auto login means u can still get in.
[16:15] <mikeW68> philinux, I agree, problem now is I can't seem to change it or even remove the password and create a new one
[16:15] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, recovery mode didnt help?
[16:16] <zwirc> TheLordOfTime, but it used 1 hour to dump, so sould be lying somewhere? :P
[16:16] <philinux> mikeW68: sounds like a reinstall or hack the password to see what it is. After all it's your machine
[16:16] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop nope, I tried passwd "username" and it doesn't prompt me for new password, I've tried changing it with the usermod -p and nada
[16:17] <TomyLaptop> passwd username without the quotes too?
[16:17] <mikeW68> philinux thoughts on how to do that,
[16:17] <mikeW68> tomylaptop yup
[16:17] <TomyLaptop> that's odd
[16:17] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop yup and very frustrating
[16:17] <Pici> mikeW68: What does passwd -S  report?
[16:17] <TomyLaptop> did you reset the root pw at least so you have something to start from without recovery mode?
[16:18] <philinux> mikeW68: as hamstermar says. I've never done anything like that
[16:18] <zwirc> 90,387,844 queryes
[16:18] <blueoil22> hello
[16:19] <mikeW68> Pici shows username and P then date then 0 9999 7 -1
[16:19] <AndreiCurelaru> hi blueoil
[16:19] <mikeW68> tomylaptop, nope
[16:20] <blueoil22> hi AndreiCurelaru
[16:20] <atjehcyber> brotha
[16:20] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, recovery mode, passwd, enter a password, write it down
[16:21] <TomyLaptop> to get root rights, type "su" and enter that password
[16:21] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop so passwd, no username
[16:21] <atjehcyber> i have aerespond@erespond-cayang:~$ (on terminal) but am need make erepons@info:~$
[16:22] <TomyLaptop> yes. that sets the current account's password
[16:22] <llutz> !hostname | atjehcyber
[16:22] <ubottu> atjehcyber: Use hostname <somehostname> to set the hostname, or to do it permanently: edit /etc/hosts to include BOTH the old and new hostname and then change /etc/hostname to the new one. WARNING! Make sure that your current hostname and /etc/hosts match, otherwise sudo may not work properly.
[16:22] <TomyLaptop> root is extra special and doesnt need the old password to change passwords
[16:22] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop ok will try that, weee this is fun.. NOT!
[16:23] <atjehcyber> ilutz
[16:23] <atjehcyber> can you tell me how to used terminal for it ?
[16:23] <TomyLaptop> llutz... linux, not apple
[16:23] <llutz> TomyLaptop: ?
[16:24] <TomyLaptop> prepend "his name is "
[16:24] <llutz> atjehcyber: you want to change the hostname of that machine, not only the bash-prompt, correct?
[16:24] <atjehcyber> am need changge host name on terminal with command are that posible ?
[16:24] <atjehcyber> yes
[16:24] <atjehcyber> am need change hostname with no effect for all system, am have webserver on my ubuntu

[16:28] <sw> atjehcyber No, you can be here, I was just wondering if Ubuntu had a language channel for you, to make it easier for you to understand.
[16:29] <atjehcyber> ok whare it
[16:29] <philinux> atjehcyber: if you speak portuguese you might be better in their channel
[16:29] <mikeW68> tomylaptop nope entered passwd and no prompt for new password
[16:29] <atjehcyber> i can't used that
[16:29] <llutz> atjehcyber: "sudo nano /etc/hostname"  change the hostname to your wishes,then CTRL-X to save/exit. "sudo nano /etc/hosts" change it also, make sure it is the same as in "/etc/hostname", ctrl-X to exit/save.
[16:29] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, guh, what?

[16:38] <TomyLaptop> or do you have internet in recovery mode?
[16:38] <kslater> You can have it I think. Might have to do some manual config depending on what network interface card you'd want to use

[16:40] <thelinux> MACMIND Hello!
[16:40] <MACMIND> I have a question, is there any computer made of completely free software nowadays ? even bios
[16:40] <atjehcyber> are i need antivirus on my ubuntu ?
[16:40] <mikeW68> tomylaptop, how do I send you my email
[16:40] <thelinux> MACMIND Can you reformulate your question?
[16:41] <MACMIND> yes, Richard stallman uses the yeloong because its made up of only free software
[16:41] <thelinux> atjehcyber: You don't need antivirus for ubuntu.
[16:41] <MACMIND> is there any such computer in the market today ?
[16:41] <atjehcyber> so can you tell me what the best application on ubuntu for education
[16:42] <TomyLaptop> mikeW68, dont bother, i'll just send it to you via IRC query
[16:42] <atjehcyber> i need maximal my ubuntu 10.4 for education we hard for internet
[16:42] <mikeW68> Tomylaptop that works
[16:42] <thelinux> MACMIND: You mean OS(operating system), not computer. Well Ubuntu is made up of free software. Reason Stallman doesn't like Ubuntu very much because Ubuntu offers to download proprietary software, like those drivers.
[16:42] <MACMIND> no, I mean, a computer that has bios that is not proprietary !
[16:43] <MACMIND> is there such a computer ?
[16:43] <thelinux> atjehcyber: Go to Ubuntu Software Center, you have there whole category for educational applications and games.
[16:43] <thelinux> MACMIND: I'm not aware of such computer, I'll check online.

[16:45] <thelinux> MACMIND: Check online coreboot it's free and open source, it can replace proprietary BIOS.
[16:45] <MACMIND> thelinux, why stallman calls linux, the gnu ?

[16:57] <lantizia> Hey on Ubuntu 12.04 (or even maybe 12.10) I've noticed if you attach a usb disk with ntfs it'll just mount it for you without questions or installation of any packages - is the same true for exFAT and which would you say is a better choice (they ARE the only choices in this case)
[16:57] <atjehcyber> oke but i try to put sudo ap-get install sofware-center have error notfound
[16:57] <thelinux> atjecyber: Yes, use what philinux said. But that PPA I agve you had never version of Ubuntu Software Center,

[17:02] <atjehcyber> so if i used sudo apt-get update firefox  that mean for update ?
[17:02] <philinux> atjehcyber: what does this command show. apt-cache policy firefox
[17:03] <thelinux> atjehcyber: It won't work that way.  update is used to update or refresh the repositories for new versions.
[17:03] <atjehcyber> oke
[17:04] <thelinux> philinux: He has Ubuntu 10.04. So I guess he has older version of Firefox.

[17:46] <yousaf_> for a php application that i am hosting
[17:47] <jhutchins_wk> toordog: That's the kind of thing that it's best not to use a preconfigured system.  In order to manage it, you're going to have to learn the things you have to know to install and configure it anyway.  If you try to run it without knowing those things it won't go well for you.
[17:50] <jhutchins_wk> yousaf_: Error logs are generally in /var/log, but winscp is not the best way to view them.  If you use putty you can log in to the server and view them there.

[18:00] <joe9> I tried to install ubuntu with the wubi_install.exe. The installation instructions use C:/ to install. I installed it to the D: drive as my C: does not have enough space.
[18:01] <joe9> Is that ok?

[18:11] <th3pun15h3r> personally prefer openbox
[18:11] <jrib> LTF: seems like grub just passes "ro recovery nomodeset" on the kernel line

[18:15] <Success> s/will/(with/while)
[18:15] <KaRmA> Success, isn't charging a product of hardware not software ?
[18:16] <Mir09> joe9: maybe you have to change the boot sequence into grub
[18:16] <Success> KaRmA, no, there are drivers
[18:16] <KaRmA> Success, on which model? If I plug in any of my Hp laptops that i've had (5 or so) they all charge even while turned off.... so no software in play.
[18:16] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk, : How can this be done? Do you have any guides or anything?
[18:16] <joe9> Mir09: you mean bios, correct?
[18:16] <Success> HP dv7-3085dx
[18:17] <KaRmA> Success, so it has to be turned on + certain driver installed to charge? what a stupid design
[18:17] <AndreiCurelaru>  /ignore -channels #ubuntu * PARTS QUITS
[18:17] <Success> While I had ubuntu installed my battery wouldn't charge on windows, it always said plugged in but not charging, it would charge while turned off or lid closed though ( standby|hibernate )
[18:17] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: I don't know of a universal option to disable them, it may be by module, so you'd have to check the documentation for each one.
[18:18] <AndreiCurelaru>  /ignore -channels #ubuntu * JOINS PARTS QUITS
[18:18] <Success> AndreiCurelaru, no the drivers are only needed while in OS
[18:18] <IdleOne> AndreiCurelaru: no space in front of the /
[18:18] <Success> ubuntu didn't seem to have the drivers and when installed messed it up. it wouldn't show charging or battery percentage or anything. and when on windows after install ubuntu my battery wouldn't charge
[18:18] <AndreiCurelaru> Ooops :)
[18:19] <Success> i was able to keep it alive with power off though. but i had to uninstall ubuntu because of it
[18:19] <Mir09> joe9: you check the bios if is correctly set, but what I mena is the sequence of the grub boot menu
[18:19] <AndreiCurelaru> did not see the space
[18:19] <KaRmA> Success, sorry to hear that, what a terrible device lol
[18:19] <ztgu> Is there anyone here who have experience booting linux from a Windows 8 computer. (installed by manufacturer)

=== erry_ is now known as erry
[18:30] <Success> what is wayland
[18:30] <thelinux> xkernel: I think it´s very ambitious and great decision that Ubuntu may use Wayland.
[18:30] <oconnore> jhutchins_wk: also, maximizing a window can take 10-15 seconds, during which the machine is frozen.
[18:30] <thelinux> Success: Display protocol. Similiar to Xorg.
[18:31] <Success> how is it better?
[18:31] <thelinux> Success: It's a lot faster and smoother, it can handle much more and use less resources. Check videos on Wayland.
[18:32] <jhutchins_wk> thelinux: I think it will be available as an option before it is made the default.
[18:32] <jhutchins_wk> oconnore: is 12.10 the only version you've run onit?
[18:32] <thelinux> xkernel: But I may be wrong, Ubutnu might soon start to develop more seriously on it soon, as I see there are not many poeple developing Wayland. I may contribute to that project soon.
[18:33] <oconnore> jhutchins_wk: the same thing happened on 12.04, before I upgraded.

[19:06] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: Are you trying to add the usb to the grub menu?
[19:06] <devlos> ztgu,  when yu sudo grub-update you sould see if it saw and added linux from usb to grub on hard drive. if it does you can reboot and boot usb from internal hard drives grub, no bios involved. make sense?

[19:10] <jrib> zfe: the link ubottu posted is a wiki; you can edit it
[19:10] <devlos> ztgu, ?? are you asking or telling?
[19:11] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: Look at the grub options to set a delay and to make sure there's more than one option.  If there's only one option it might not wait.
[19:13] <ztgu> devlos: jhutchins_wk : I can boot into several things from the grub. The reason why I want to boot my bootable usb from grub is that the F2 boot menu integrated in win8 boot doesn't work after I installed grub. So I guess I need to boot my device from grub somehow
[19:13] <TheCrownedFox> Hi! So, I have a raid 1 array that I am trying to mount with ubuntu 12.04, however I'm getting an error saying that one or more block devicces are holding /dev/dm-0 and I'm not entirely sure why.
[19:14] <devlos> ztgu, i told you how already..

[19:15] <nemos> Please help i freshly installed windows 7 and ubuntu12.10 added with win and i dont have grub meny it goes directly to windows
[19:16] <ztgu> I just did the sudo update-grub

[19:16] <TomyLobo> did you do that, nemos?

[19:18] <jhutchins_wk> Sorry, still learning the bot.
[19:18] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: Was the usb drive mounted (not just plugged in)?
[19:18] <ztgu> devlos: THe usb is mounted into my linux system, yes.
[19:19] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: I suppose you could try doing update-grub with it un-mounted, see if it detects it then, but you can always add a manual entry.
[19:19] <ztgu> It's plugged in, and also mounted
[19:20] <ztgu> How does the manual entry work then?

[19:28] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk: When it comes to mounting in terminal this time. I made a usbflash dir inside /mnt. If I do the following command: mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/usbflash. What happens then?
[19:28] <troop> Starting crash report submission daemon -> is it problem?
[19:28] <devlos> Ztgu,  i just realized i was saying that backwords, sudo update-grub... make sure usb is mounted, run sudo update-grub, reboot into grub on hd, look for new entry for the usb.
[19:30] <ztgu> devlos: I know you update-grub is the right command. But the output doesn't show my usb.
[19:31] <ztgu> devlos jhutchins_wk : I will give it a try now anyways. will be back
[19:31] <devlos> ztgu, use filemanager to see if it is mounted or   ls /mnt/usbflash   in terminal
[19:31] <troop> Skipping profile in /etc/apparmor.d/disable: usr.bin.firefox    -> is it bug?
[19:32] <ztgu> devlos: I had the same output from : sudo update grub when both mounted and unmounted, It's not a good sign, for my boot to work. (I think)
[19:32] <lacrymology> is there a way I can run apt-get update on a specific repo? for some reason ar.archive.ubuntu.com is failing big time

[19:35] <KP> sorry new to ubuntu and ldapserver
[19:36] <jhutchins_wk> KP: The reason things like that aren't automatic is because you really do need to read the docs and understand what you're doing, not just use a generic default.
[19:36] <ztgu> WEll, it didn't work
[19:36] <KP> i read those ubntu docs but the problem was the solution was in 12.04 doc and there was no entries in 12.10 docs abt ldap
[19:36] <ztgu> There was no usb in my grub menu
[19:37] <ztgu> would be wierd anyways
[19:37] <KP> and i was not able to locate the slapd.conf file
[19:38] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: That has to do with the state of the device when grub loads.  The system has to present the USB devices without any drivers or anything loaded yet.
[19:39] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: If the USB device is listed as an option in the BIOS that might make a difference, but it sounds like you might be working with some sort of efi system.
[19:40] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk:  EFI, correct,  My usb is listed as an option in bios, can't boot it from bios anyways.
[19:41] <bronaugh> ok, so using unity. periodically the icons in the launcher on the left seem to scroll or some such, such that only the bottom of the bottom icon is visible at the top of the launcher.
[19:41] <bronaugh> what's the workaround / fix for this?
[19:42] <Phoenixz> Anybody who knows what is up with java on ubuntu? I tried installing eclipse, failed completely because (it seems that) java is no longer packaged with ubuntu.. or somehting like that? I had to install some crappy oracle package that would install java for me.. ? anybody who knows what happened with that?
[19:42] <bekks> !java | Phoenixz
[19:42] <ubottu> Phoenixz: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.

[19:42] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk: Advice? Possible to have the usb in a mounted state at grub?

[20:03] <bekks> jjason: Yes, it cant.
[20:03] <Nukien_> I have a cronjob that runs as a user to perform some updates. When it's finished it needs to be able to restart php-fpm but that needs root privs. What would be the cleanest way to do that?

[20:04] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk: the link u sent me, why: sudo apt-get install --reinstall libdebian-installer4 ???

[20:07] <bekks> jjason: When you are going to use suspend2disk, you need 8GB swap at least.
[20:08] <jjason> bekks: i have a second internal..  could i use that for ubuntu swap?
[20:08] <KsM> bekks: what
[20:08] <bekks> jjason: Sure.
[20:08] <bekks> KsM: suspend2disk needs as much swap as RAM installed in your computer.
[20:09] <KsM> wouldn't hibernating/suspending to disk only need as much swap as the RAM *being used*
[20:09] <klpkt> Hello; I have a problem, can anyone help me? I am running Ubuntu 12.10 multibooted with Windows, and one day I wanted to make it easier to access the Windows partition from Ubuntu, and I, since I don't know very much about how changing permissions can really screw me, used sudo chmod to change the permissions so that I could rename it. Now, Ubuntu sees the Windows partition as some kind of non-folder item, and it also does that to any CD-RO
[20:09] <klpkt> Ms that I put into it. Can anyone help me figure out the problem?
[20:09] <jjason> i thought it just whats being used, yeah ksm
[20:09] <ikra> hi all, i have a problem with suspend: with kernel 3.2.0.32 it works well, but after upgraded to 3.2.0.35 it doesn't, if install newer kernel the problem still, but if i use 3.2.0.32 it works again. So i think it's a "kernel" configuration problem, what test could i make what data do you need to help me understand this problem? thanks!
[20:09] <bekks> KsM: And what if 8GB are in use...?
[20:10] <jjason> what happens if my session is using more ram than what i have, through virtual ram, and i suspend to a swap thats only as big as physical?
[20:10] <dpurgert> people still use virtual ram?
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[20:10] <bekks> dpurgert: Sure.
[20:10] <jjason> i dunno.  it can happen
[20:10] <blim> how do I make a program use a specific core?
[20:10] <KsM> bekks: then it'll be really slow if you have enough swap
[20:11] <KsM> and if not, it'll kick you back out
[20:11] <jjason> oh, it just wont suspend?
[20:11] <dpurgert> jjason, then you need to have enough swap for the virtual ram (which is in swap anyway, IIRC)
[20:11] <bekks> jjason: Correct.
[20:12] <KsM> If you don't have enough swap as a swap partition, you can always just make a swapfile or whatever
[20:12] <jjason> so..  if my system doesnt generally use more than say..  4gigs, then i can make a 4gig swap just to be able to sleep, and if im over, then it wont sleep unless i close programs?
[20:12] <bekks> jjason: No. :)
[20:12] <KsM> I have 4gb of ram and 2gb swap, I never usually go above 1.5gb
[20:13] <jjason> bekks: no..  what part of that was wrong?
[20:13] <bekks> jjason: You have to ensure that you are not _using_ more than 4GB RAM - which can be used by one application.
[20:13] <bekks> KsM: I have 16GB and I usually use between 12GB and 16GB. Different use cases.

[20:15] <bekks> jjason: You cant, correct.
[20:15] <dpurgert> klpkt, what permissions did you change
[20:15] <jjason> if i dont generally use
[20:15] <jjason> hm
[20:15] <bekks> jjason: At least not for suspend2disk.
[20:16] <jjason> you mentioned a swap file
[20:16] <jjason> this is on ubuntu partition?
[20:16] <bekks> jjason: Generally, you can have SWAP < RAM -- being unable to suspend2disk.
[20:16] <bekks> jjason: Yes. And you would have to have a file as big as your RAM. Alas: wasting space.
[20:16] <lucido> ubuntu fails to start on my old ass amd xp machine with abit siluro fx5200 with nvidia drivers

[20:17] <lucido> I mean unity fails to start
[20:17] <lucido> or freezes
[20:17] <dpurgert> lucido, make sure you have the i386 distro and not the x64/i686 distro
[20:17] <bekks> dpurgert: Because...?
[20:17] <jjason> so its the ubuntu equivalent of pagefile?
[20:17] <bekks> jjason: Yes.
[20:18] <lucido> dpurgert, i386 is the only one that installs
[20:18] <jjason> bekks" well, that way, i can resize it or delete it at least, right
[20:18] <dpurgert> bekks, because AMD_XP processors were 32 bit :)

[20:19] <bekks> ph4nt0m: Yes.
[20:19] <ph4nt0m> Ok haw lomg can it take?

[20:20] <bekks> ph4nt0m: Until all needed packages are downloaded.
[20:20] <ph4nt0m> How long*
[20:20] <jhutchins_wk> jjason: You can have swap smaller than your ram.
[20:20] <bekks> jjason: How small?
[20:20] <dpurgert> klpkt, 777 is 'rwx' (read/write/execute) permissions for owner/group/"global" so it shouldn't do anything "terrible"

[20:21] <dpurgert> klpkt, I fail to see the problem there ;)  or do you mean that you can't access anything on the NTFS partition while in linux?
[20:22] <bekks> jjason: Everything else like data, etc. does not reside on the SSD. And taking that into account, the system is smaller than 30GB, even with several copy of several custom build kernel source trees.
[20:22] <jjason> jhutchins_wk: and its just a situation where, if current use > swap, suspend will fail until i close some stuff?
[20:22] <jhutchins_wk> Once you go over 2G of RAM there's not much point in increasing the swap size.
[20:22] <bekks> jhutchins_wk: Unless you want to use suspend2disk.
[20:22] <jhutchins_wk> jjason: No, suspend to disk will never work if swap is less than RAM.  Suspend to RAM will still work (if your hardware supports it).
[20:23] <dpurgert> klpkt, but in seriousness ... if you can't get at the ntfs data, try unmounting it (sudo umount /mnt/whatever) and then try remounting it manually
[20:23] <bekks> jhutchins_wk: Thats where we've already been... -.-
[20:23] <jjason> suspend2disk is linux hibernate, right?
[20:23] <Magellanicus> it doesnt appear that option
[20:23] <Billcr48> anybody here good with issuing keyboard shortcuts?
[20:23] <Magellanicus> dpurgert
[20:23] <dpurgert> also, you _may_ need to fix your fstab, depending on how borked it got
[20:23] <jhutchins_wk> bekks: Sorry to rerun it then.
[20:23] <klpkt> dpburgert, When I am in Ubuntu, and I try to open the Windows partition, it says 'The folder contents could not be displayed. You do not have the permissions necessary to view the contents of "gustav"', gustav being the name of my partition.
[20:23] <dpurgert> Magellanicus, yes?
[20:24] <jjason> suspend2disk is hibernate, and suspend2ram is sleep?  and suspend2ram will work without any swap at all, right?
[20:24] <jhutchins_wk> klpkt: Do you have ntfs3g installed?
[20:24] <Magellanicus> it doestn work
[20:24] <bluezone> lol
[20:24] <klpkt> jhutchins_wk, How do I check it?
[20:24] <Magellanicus> theres no remove from panel option
[20:24] <Magellanicus> when i right click on the,
[20:24] <Magellanicus> dpurgert
[20:24] <jhutchins_wk> klpkt: Well, first, do you remember installing it?  Next, dpkg -l
=== jackson_ is now known as Noskcaj
[20:25] <dpurgert> Magellanicus, did you lock the taskbar perhaps?
[20:25] <jhutchins_wk>  klpkt dpkg -l | grep ntfs
[20:25] <jhutchins_wk> klpkt: also cat /proc/filesystems
[20:25] <klpkt> jhutchins_wk, I have a package ntfs-3g, yes.
[20:25] <Magellanicus> how do i unlock it?
[20:26] <dpurgert> did you accidentally change the owner/group on the mount?
[20:26] <jjason> ok, thanks for the info
[20:26] <Magellanicus> dpurgert how do i unlock the taskbar¡
[20:26] <Magellanicus> ?
[20:26] <dpurgert> Magellanicus, with ... which desktop?  Unity, Gnome, KDE ... ?
[20:26] <Magellanicus> gnome shell
[20:26] <Magellanicus> ubuntu 12.04
[20:27] <klpkt> dpurgert, I don't know, I can't find anything saying who is the owner.
[20:27] <dpurgert> Magellanicus, OK, with the bar across the left hand side; or did you convert back to Gnome2/3 (or whatever) to have the taskbar across the top again?
[20:27] <jeffrey_> does anyone know how to obtain the source-code for a "Meta Package"?
[20:28] <jeffrey_> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/meta-gnustep
[20:28] <dpurgert> klpkt, where's it mounted?  should be something like "/mnt/name"
[20:28] <Magellanicus> i have two bars one at the top and one at the bottom
[20:28] <Magellanicus> i havent modified anything
[20:28] <jeffrey_> It appears that the gnustep packages have not been built yet
[20:28] <Magellanicus> except
[20:28] <klpkt> dpurgert: The /mnt folder is empty, but the file itself seems to be in /media.
[20:28] <Magellanicus> that i have added firefox (which i want to remove) to the top bar of gnome shell
[20:29] <dpurgert> Magellanicus, OK, so the old gnome desktop.  It should be as simple as "right click the thing on the bar, and choose the "remove" option"
[20:29] <dpurgert> or drag it off... it's been a while since I messed with it, and I'm playing with the unity desktop at the moment
[20:29] <MonkeyDust> dpurgert  Magellanicus try super-alt right click on the bar
[20:30] <dpurgert> klpkt, ok so then go to /media -- it's automounting it (same as if it were a USB drive)
[20:30] <dpurgert> then do ls -l
[20:30] <jhutchins_wk> klpkt: That's usually because it's not in fstab.  You may be able to set it up in fstab so that ordinary users have rights to it.  It's probably root-only now.
[20:30] <jhutchins_wk> klpkt: Safe but kinda dumb default.
[20:31] <ago_> avatar
[20:31] <jeffrey_> when I do a: apt-get install gnustep gnustep-devel doesn't produce a working system on v12.10
[20:31] <Magellanicus> what its super-alt right click
[20:31] <Magellanicus> ?
[20:31] <klpkt> dpurgert, jhutchins_wk: What do you mean?
[20:31] <Magellanicus> how do i do that
[20:31] <jhutchins_wk> klpkt:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions
[20:31] <Magellanicus> alt right click doesnt show me the option "remove"
[20:31] <t2mahesh> can some one tell me, how can I know which programs are using network/internet and on which port(s). a terminal command will be a great help.
[20:32] <dpurgert> I'd do with the "unmount it and remount it manually" option
[20:32] <Osmodivs1> Does anyone knows what's wrong with this commands? I am trying to compile something: or i in *.rpm; do sudo alien -cv $i; done
[20:32] <Osmodivs1> bash: syntax error near unexpected token `do'
[20:32] <ph4nt0m> Netstats
[20:32] <ph4nt0m> Mashed
[20:33] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: Are you really missing an f?
[20:33] <ph4nt0m>  t2mahesh. Type netstats in a Shell
[20:33] <t2mahesh> ph4nt0m: thanks :) i had forgotten this command
[20:33] <Osmodivs1> jhutchins_wk: I do not know, I am just copy-pasting
[20:33] <ph4nt0m> Np
[20:34] <shojo> it's netstat, not netstats
[20:34] <Osmodivs1> jhutchins_wk: Can you tell what's wtong here?
[20:34] <klpkt> jhutchins_wk: Okay, I don't understand anything of what that says...
[20:34] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: As pasted, "for" is missing the leading f.
[20:34] <ph4nt0m> Shojo oki
[20:34] <ph4nt0m> I missted
[20:34] <t2mahesh> shojo: ya, i figured that out ;)
[20:35] <shojo> t2mahesh: oh ok, what r u trying to do cuz i just joined the chan and i didn't see the question
[20:35] <Osmodivs1> jhutchins_wk: Oh no, no no, This is the correct command: for i in *.rpm; do sudo alien -cv $i; done But I get this in return: bash: syntax error near unexpected token `do'
[20:35] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: Hm.
[20:36] <dpurgert> shouldn't it be something like for i in `ls *rpm`; do ... stuff ... ?
[20:36] <t2mahesh> shojo: some thing was using my internet a lot, so was wondering what is that. so asked for, how to know. it was disturbing while playing game :D
[20:37] <Osmodivs1> dpurgert: Well, this is how was written in the README file
[20:37] <ph4nt0m> If u play game t2mahesh cut ur torrent à all u dont use
[20:37] <shojo> t2mahesh: easiest way to monitor your connections is firestarter firewall
[20:37] <dpurgert> Osmodivs1, that presents an interesting challenge.  thing is, you're not setting anything to iterate over
[20:38] <Osmodivs1> Type the following in a single line, include the “done” ( PRECISELY AS WRITTEN HERE, DO A COPY / PASTE ):Links:
[20:38] <Osmodivs1> for i in *.rpm; do sudo alien -cv $i; done
[20:38] <shojo> i'm sorry, i meant easier, not easiest... idk what the easiest would be. But firestarter does it continuously
[20:38] <blim> Ive managed to install ubuntu on my xbox but only one controller will work at any one time
[20:38] <Osmodivs1> (the command will take a while to complete!)
[20:38] <t2mahesh> shojo: cool. hope that has a gui
[20:38] <shojo> yes, it does, t2mahesh  and it's really easy
[20:39] <Ben64> Osmodivs1: what are you trying to install from rpm? that could be dangerous, and isn't supported here
[20:39] <dpurgert> worked for me (though I don't have alien ...)
[20:39] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: for i in $(ls *.rpm);
[20:39] <shojo> t2mahesh: then if you find unknown unauthorised connections, you can block them
[20:39] <Osmodivs1> Ben64: I am trying to install Autodesk Maya
[20:40] <Ben64> jhutchins_wk: not supposed to use ls in scripts
[20:40] <jhutchins_wk> Ben64: Who says it's a script?
[20:40] <Ben64> jhutchins_wk: the "for i in"
[20:40] <jhutchins_wk> Ben64: I'm sure I would be scorned in #bash, but that will work.
[20:41] <t2mahesh> shojo: thanks, installed that
[20:41] <dpurgert> Ben64, so how would you go about it then?
[20:41] <shojo> t2mahesh: glad to help
[20:41] <Osmodivs1> This is part of the instructions: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1507661/
[20:43] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: Is that from autodesk support?
[20:43] <Osmodivs1> jhutchins_wk: Nope.
[20:43] <Osmodivs1> jhutchins_wk: I guess I am on my own then...
[20:43] <djono> hello do hex editors allow opening a file of 8.5 gb?
[20:43] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: Ok, be aware that there are a lot of things in ubuntu that are not in the places they would be on an rpm system.
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
[20:44] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: Even across various rpm distributions there are variations, and installing say a Mandriva RPM on a Fedora system might work - for a while.
[20:45] <dpurgert> djono, probably ... but, um why're you needing to open that's 8.5G?
[20:45] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: The syntax I posted should work though.
[20:46] <djono> i need to hex edit an iso. i tried in all the hex editors available and they keep closing out when trying to copy or out of memory error

[20:47] <djono> when i get it opened i try the select all in edit and click copy once that happens the program closes

[20:47] <djono> to fix
[20:47] <djono> to fix it
[20:48] <Guest5288> im so confus
[20:48] <jrib> djono: how is it broken?
[20:48] <nixbag> i have a question regarding the 'commandline expert install' method. during the package manager config, it asks if i want services enabled for security, partners, and extras archives, with 'security' being the only one checkmarked. i was already asked to add universe and multiverse earlier in the install, so what do these archive service options mean?
[20:48] <djono> i don't think im able to talk about it here
[20:48] <jrib> djono: ok, well good luck with your issue
[20:49] <djono> just a truncated iso
[20:49] <dpurgert> djono, um ... 8.5GB of hex data is ... ~8 billion characters ... if you're good enough to "fix" the flaws in that much data
[20:49] <dreamon> installed vsftpd. how can I remove vsftpd from autostart. coulnt find a solution.
[20:49] <mks1209> Hi all, i'm trying to send sms via a python script (pyhumod) and it gives error that /bin/ttyusb1 not accessible. how can i make it accessible
[20:50] <jrib> dreamon: does it have a /etc/init/vsftpd.conf?
[20:50] <bestdnd> hi. how can i change the font in nautilus? i get many archives with hebrew file names, and after extracting them with ark, the names look like this (square with 4 hexadecimal digits) 
[20:50] <jrib> dreamon: (or something similar in /etc/init??)
[20:50] <djono> its just crc data that is reused towards the end to fix 3 percent of the missing sector
[20:50] <jhutchins_wk> djono: How much RAM do you have?  How much swap?
[20:50] <dpurgert> bestdnd, you'll need the hebrew language installed most likely
[20:50] <ActionParsnip> dreamon: http://www.gaggl.com/2012/06/disable-services-on-boot-ubuntu-12-04/
[20:50] <djono> 1gb and 1gb swap
[20:50] <djono> swap linux created
[20:51] <ActionParsnip> djono: you'll want 2Gb swap for 1Gb RAM
[20:51] <jhutchins_wk> djono: ... and you're trying to edit an 8.5 GB file...
[20:51] <dpurgert> djono, you need a minimum of 8,5 GB available ram (+swap, but RAM is better) ... you're better off re-downloading the DVD.
[20:51] <jrib> ActionParsnip: that page has outdated information (dreamon)
[20:52] <jhutchins_wk> I would say closer to 18GB.
=== thiago_ is now known as Guest63448
[20:52] <djono> owww. could i creat a 9 gb swap???
[20:52] <dreamon> jrib, /etc/init/vsftpd.conf -> yes

[20:53] <dreamon> jrib, http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1507685/
[20:53] <dpurgert> mks1209, ubuntu uses a "hardcoded" (though changeable) root password
[20:53] <djono> drm?
[20:53] <jrib> ActionParsnip: the information about upstart services is outdated. It's better to use overrides than delete the .conf file
[20:53] <ActionParsnip> mks1209: you don't need a root password, you have sudo
[20:53] <ActionParsnip> jrib: gotcha
[20:53] <bestdnd> <dpurgert>, how do i get the hebrew language? there's nothing about hebrew in the software centre
[20:54] <Osmodivs1> jhutchins_wk: Well, you'r syntaxis is working...
[20:54] <dpurgert> bestdnd, um ... google?  (I dunno, tbh)
[20:54] <mks1209> so how do i give access to the user on ttyusb1
[20:54] <jhutchins_wk> dpurgert: Since when?

[20:54] <jhutchins_wk> dpurgert: I am almost certain "hardcoded" is not the word you meant to use.
[20:55] <jhutchins_wk> Osmodivs1: Hope you backed up the system first!
[20:55] <jrib> ActionParsnip: I mean doing that is ok if you want upstart to completely forget about the job.  But using overrides will let you use upstart to start the service later

[20:55] <ActionParsnip> mks1209: who is the current owner and group?
[20:55] <dpurgert> jhutchins_wk, yes, 'hardcoded' was wrong ... although last time I looked into it was like Ubuntu 4 or something thereabouts
[20:55] <mks1209> root and dialout
[20:55] <ActionParsnip> jrib: ahhh thats much less destructive, thanks :)
[20:55] <nixbag> i have a question regarding the 'commandline expert install'. it asks if i want services enabled for security, partners, and extras archives. so what do these archive service options mean? i've already chosen to add universe and multiverse. are these archive services like init.d scripts that check periodically for updates?
[20:56] <jhutchins_wk> dpurgert: It's locked and has no password, but you can set one, which unlocks it.
[20:56] <ActionParsnip> mks1209: then add the user to the dialout group and it will get access
[20:56] <djono> does anyone know why the network manager in lubuntu is way better than mint?
[20:56] <dpurgert> jhutchins_wk, yeah, like I said ... it's been a while ;)
[20:56] <lonewulf85> Hello I have a question about wine could I ask it here?
[20:56] <djono> go ahead
[20:56] <ActionParsnip> djono: its a different distro
[20:56] <mks1209> thanks all, i will google how to add people to a group as it allow on the GUI
[20:57] <ActionParsnip> djono: each distro has strengths and weaknesses
[20:57] <lonewulf85> Do I need a windows product key to run the programs like office?
[20:57] <jrib> dreamon: You can use overrides and the manual keyword.  See: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#override-files .  If you read the script, you can also see that it checks CONFFILE to see if there's a listen line there.  If you remove listen lines from /etc/vsftpd.conf I guess that would be *another way* (I'm guessing from reading the script)
[20:57] <jrib> lonewulf85: try #winehq
[20:57] <ActionParsnip> lonewulf85: no, just the Office license key
[20:57] <djono> oh thougt it was the same cause they look just the same. that was the deciding factor for me had to drop mint and using lubuntu now
[20:58] <vitimiti> o/
[20:58] <lonewulf85> Okay thanks
[20:58] <ActionParsnip> lonewulf85: also check the wine appdb for compatibility with the Office version you are intending to install
[20:58] <djono> winehq is on freenode lonewulf
[20:58] <ActionParsnip> djono: many distros look the same, doesn't mean very much at all
[20:58] <dreamon> jrib, Thanks.
[20:58] <djono> oh i c. even if they are ubuntu based
[20:59] <dpurgert> wine to get an office suite seems a bit over the top
[20:59] <werewolf> hi all
[20:59] <sw2band> .
[20:59] <djono> its funny the best network manager ive used was on puppy. its the most mobile broadband usb friendly
[20:59] <ActionParsnip> djono: the packaging and default settings are different, ubuntu is debian based but the 3 are different and have separate support to reflect this
[20:59] <werewolf> i've got a problem on xubuntu 12.04
[20:59] <werewolf> with network manager
[20:59] <jhutchins_wk> dpurgert: To get an office suite, yes.  To get MSOffice because you have to have the MS product, that's what wine and crossoveroffice are for.
[21:00] <djono> whats the prob
[21:00] <ActionParsnip> djono: I like wicd, it has the abilityu for the user to name the interface name to use for each thing.
[21:00] <dpurgert> jhutchins_wk, fair enough
[21:00] <guntbert> werewolf: just ask your question - on one line please
[21:00] <nixbag> has anyone here done the expert install method, and know what the 'archive services' do exactly? it is part of the package manager config, aftr you choose universe and multiverse repos to be aded.
[21:00] <djono> wicd doesnt support usb broadband til the new one comes out
[21:00] <ActionParsnip> djono: not something I use ;)
[21:01] <werewolf> on the boot my xubuntu don't take a ip address, just everyone on terminal sudo dhclient eth0
[21:01] <djono> yeah i know. just an expat in a country where its the norm to have a usb stick net
[21:01] <ActionParsnip> werewolf: did you use /etc/network/interfaces to define the network by any chance?
[21:01] <ActionParsnip> djono: horses for courses, dude
[21:02] <werewolf> no i didn't
[21:02] <djono> hehe fair enough mate
[21:02] <werewolf> i use network manager
[21:02] <ActionParsnip> werewolf: did you configure anyth9ing in network manager?
[21:02] <machicola> anyone happen to know how to , when using keyboard only to navigate gnome/xwindows (i'm using ubuntu 12.10 w/gnome-fallback) , jump across the top panel? I'm getting to the top panel with CTRL+ALT+TAB but unable to move across the screen to the left side of the panel (stuck on the right side of top panel)
[21:02] <werewolf> i would like to set up a static ip and delete network manager
[21:03] <werewolf> cane you help me?
[21:03] <werewolf> *can
[21:03] <ActionParsnip> werewolf: you can use /etc/network/interfaces for that
[21:03] <ActionParsnip> werewolf: you will need to set the nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf too
[21:03] <werewolf> and network manager can i delete then?
[21:03] <machicola> i know I can use ALT+F1 to get there, to the applications menu, but I'd rather know how to with purely directional navigation keys
[21:03] <werewolf> ok
[21:03] <ActionParsnip> werewolf: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/setting-up-an-network-interfaces-file/
[21:04] <Lasivian> what file do I add a startup command to exactly? I'm seeing diffrent mentions on different parts of the web, but I went to 12.04 and networkmanager isn;t loading it's daemon, thanks
[21:04] <ActionParsnip> werewolf: or in the interfaces file add the line:  dns-nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
[21:04] <guntbert> ActionParsnip: actually name servers are set in /etc/network/interfaces too (since resolvconf)
[21:04] <guntbert> :)
[21:05] <werewolf> then can i restart the network interface?
[21:05] <ActionParsnip> werewolf: sure, you can also remove all tyhe network-manager packages :)
[21:06] <guntbert> ActionParsnip: caveat, the option is dns-nameservers if I remember correctly
[21:06] <djono> does mono and wine run hand in hand?
[21:06] <ActionParsnip> guntbert: gotcha
[21:07] <ActionParsnip> guntbert: or you can write to resolv.conf then mark it as read only and immutable :)
[21:07] <KPSingh> hey anyone knows where ldapsearch command search
[21:07] <dpurgert> guntbert, yep, it's "dns-nameservers"

[21:14] <Funky> I have another question, why does ubuntu installs the bootloader to my second hard drive?
[21:15] <Lasivian> what file would a daemon start command go in to function at boot?

[21:15] <guntbert> kp: Do you have an ubuntu support question?
[21:15] <cmceldowney> All-- need help uploading a new version of a PPA. I've made 2 changes to /debian/rules file, and added notes to /debian/changelog, but keep getting issues b/c X already exists in my PPA, and uploaded version has different contents. Do I need to change names of all the files generated by debuild so it looks like a different version?
[21:15] <ActionParsnip> Funky: strange. are you using wubi at all?
[21:16] <kp> ubuntu support questions??
[21:16] <MonkeyDust> wubi :(
[21:16] <Funky> ActionParsnip, I installed using the live CD.

[21:19] <renegade_ray> I'm banging my head on this one. I'm running 3.0.0-24-server and am trying to clear out the /boot but when I run apt-get purge on one of the installed kernels I get an error "Depends: linux-image-3.0.0-29-server but it is not going to be installed" but when I try to install 3.0.0-29-server there is a device full error because /boot is full. Anyone have a suggestion?

[21:25] <niklaswe> rasp_pie: apt-get remove hp-health
[21:25] <ActionParsnip> amaroks: same as to any other folder, just specify the folder to mount to when you use the mount command
[21:25] <niklaswe> the server doesnt have support for it.. and now cant i remove it..

[21:26] <wting> Random question: If I have two usb devices, is there a performance decrease from using a powered hub vs a direct usb port (assuming a single usb controller)?
[21:26] <niklaswe> rasp_pie: the problem is that I got error when i trying to remove it..
[21:26] <wting> Is the bottleneck primarily at the usb controller (assuming devices can saturate usb port)?
[21:27] <s5fs> Hi gang, my 12.10 system seems to have 'lost' my sound card or configuration. Any links for troubleshooting? This is a Lenovo with hda-intel audio.
[21:28] <lucido> DJones, ok,its because jocky functionality has been merged into software-properties
[21:29] <wting> s5fs: Make sure it's listed: lspci | grep audio
[21:29] <SolarisBoy> wting: in my experience it depends on the device/driver the usb device will use - e.g. multiple web cams can overrun the usb bus taking bandwidth from each other degrading/breaking each other runs on the same bus
[21:29] <ddsss> to install virtualbox one just have to run: sudo apt-get install virtualbox  ? right?
[21:29] <wting> s5fs: Double check system config > sound and that you have onboard audio selected and not HDMI or something else.
[21:29] <dpurgert> ddsss, yup
[21:29] <Andrei> s5fs when i have lost the soud, i had to re'apt-get elsa sound drivers
[21:30] <dguerrero> greetings
[21:30] <s5fs> wting: nothing listed in lspci
[21:30] <bekks> ddsss: I'd follow the installation instruction on the official vbox website on how to install the latest version.
[21:30] <s5fs> wting: in system config > sound, all i have is a 'dummy' device
[21:30] <Andrei> the generic drivers (i'm on a classic PackardBell)
[21:31] <wting> s5fs: If it's not found in lspci, it's a kernel / driver issue. Start digging there...

[21:34] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk: Boot usb from the grub bootloader
[21:34] <captainfixerpc14> MACMIND, gimp on ubuntu is a good option instead of photoshop
[21:34] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: Yes?
[21:34] <kp> ok i try
[21:34] <dpurgert> dguerrero, try going back to an older kernel (if you have one available)
[21:35] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk: Do you have any idea on how to do it?
[21:35] <jhutchins_wk> MACMIND: If you're paying the price for photoshop, you might as well pay for the hardware and get support.
[21:35] <MACMIND> what you mean >?
[21:35] <r40778> I have a nameserver problem using Juno vpn client. The vpn client overwrites resolv.conf, but my ubuntu has dynamic resolv.conf | kp
[21:35] <jjason> MACMIND: he assumes you paid money for photoshop
[21:35] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: I think it depends on how your BIOS presents the USB device, and it may not be possible to resove with grub.  Did you try the directions on adding a manual entry to grub?

[21:39] <Third3ye> Is there a small app which allows you to quickly swith on or off screens, and even enable both screens? Sort of like a pop-up instead of going in to settings>screen and going through the motions...
[21:40] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk: it was this link http://kagashe.blogspot.no/2009/10/how-to-make-manual-entry-in-grub2-on.html
[21:41] <ztgu> jhutchins_wk: seems a bit wierd though
[21:42] <jrib> Third3ye: maybe http://willem.engen.nl/projects/disper/ can let you create something like that
[21:43] <jhutchins_wk> s5fs: Make sure it's not blacklisted, and if interested reboot to see if it loads automatically.  If not, you may need a modules.d file to load it.
[21:44] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: Grub2, wierd, yeah.  Sounds right.
[21:44] <s5fs> jhutchins_wk: it's not blacklisted and i'm happy to jam the entry into /etc/modules or whatever, but i'm perplexed as to why it stopped loading.
[21:45] <N1ghtCrawler> Quick and maby a bit stupid question: I'm planning to run a LAMP server on ubuntu 12.04 and have installed LAMP with tasksel. For sequrity do I have to configure UFW or is the server safe enough anyway?
[21:45] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: Skip to the part 'After reading...'  (Which, you know, reading the Grub2 documentation on the Ubuntu Wiki  might not be a bad idea).
[21:46] <jhutchins_wk> s5fs: Maybe it had too much to drink New Years Eve.

[21:47] <ztgu> belong*
[21:47] <kp> jhutchins_wk: please look to my prob if u can explained above
[21:47] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: your system will probably have a switch to change outputs
[21:48] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: if you use an nvidia GPU, then it is set using nvidia-settings
[21:48] <jhutchins_wk> ztgu: That uuid belongs to that guy's drive.  The blkid tool will find/create a UUID for your usb drive.

[22:03] <ActionParsnip> mostrom: http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/monodevelop/
[22:03] <jhutchins_wk> mostrom: I don't think that's the right way to do it in Linux.  I would look for articles about .net on linux on the web.
[22:04] <jhutchins_wk> nsaquatics: Why do you want to disable the alarm?
[22:04] <mostrom> ok, the true is that I want to run application wrote in visualc#
[22:05] <nsaquatics> Because I have to work in the same office as it is for now. The array has been rebuilt but the alarm is still going... It's driving me nuts..
[22:05] <mostrom> and installer can't install .NET
[22:05] <jhutchins_wk> nsaquatics: Doesn't it have a physical reset?
[22:05] <nsaquatics> Not that I've seen... let me look again..
[22:06] <dpurgert> mostrom, you can't compile the source with a different compiler?
[22:06] <pawleeq> hello
[22:06] <schep> Hi. Running 12.04.1 LTS. After a recent update, I'm getting 127.0.0.1 as the only DNS server in /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf , which doesn't work.  I tried adding "supersede domain-name-servers 192.168.1.1;" to /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf and rebooting, but no change.
[22:06] <mostrom> developer don;t share source, i have binary
[22:07] <jhutchins_wk> mostrom: Search for "visual c# on linux" in google and start reading.
[22:07] <mostrom> installer cheks if there is .NET. If there isn't it downloads .NET and install. And here i have error
[22:07] <jhutchins_wk> mostrom: Microsoft tools are not the way.
[22:07] <pawleeq> I have an application which needs file libgtk-1.2.so.0 to run. I think I need to install package libgtk-1.2, but how can I do that on oneiric?
[22:08] <dpurgert> schep, check /etc/network/interfaces
[22:08] <dpurgert> mostrom, ah, that would be a problem then
[22:08] <mostrom> Eh
[22:08] <schep> dpurgert: auto lo \n iface lo inet loopback
[22:09] <Mrokii> Hello. Is there a way to find out which application uses my up- and download bandwidth?
[22:09] <mostrom> should I first install .NET 1.0, then 2.0, then 3.0 etc?
[22:09] <dpurgert> schep, OK, and what do you get from running ifconfig ?
[22:09] <dpurgert> Mrokii, try tcpdump
[22:09] <delphinas> hey:)
[22:09] <schep> dpurgert: eth0 and lo.  The IP and network for eth0 IPv4 look correct.
[22:10] <jhutchins_wk> schep: You don't have an interface that can reach 192.168.1.1
[22:10] <jhutchins_wk> schep: Or maybe you do.
[22:10] <kylescottmcgill> there is also iftop, but that gives you what the destination is, so you could guess from there... \o/
[22:10] <dpurgert> schep, "correct" as in you're getting 192.168.[0|1].xxx ?
[22:10] <schep> inet addr:192.168.1.47  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
[22:11] <dpurgert> schep, yup, *should* be working then

[22:11] <delphinas> vmware or virtualbox?
[22:11] <dpurgert> you can try adding an entry to /etc/network/interfaces (then reboot) or ... do what ActionParsnip just said
[22:11] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: either
[22:12] <anthius> how do i change my machine name in 12.10
[22:12] <ActionParsnip> schep: when the networking starts, the name server will be added to /etc/resolv.conf :)
[22:12] <delphinas> do they both have same issues with graphic drivers?
[22:12] <bekks> anthius: Just use "sudo hostname newhostname"
[22:12] <kylescottmcgill> delphinas: what are you doing with VBox and VMWare?
[22:12] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, though isn't resolv.conf nuked on system restart?
[22:12] <ActionParsnip> anthius: run:   gksudo gedit /etc/hostname &       then run:  gksudo gedit /etc/hosts     and change BOTH files, change the current name in both files to the new name. Save them and reboot
[22:12] <delphinas> I'm using it to host ubuntu on windows
[22:13] <auronandace> delphinas: vbox is open source
[22:13] <kylescottmcgill> delphinas: either would be fine
[22:13] <ActionParsnip> dpurgert: it will get recreated next boot, but if you use the proper configs it can be populated as you desire
[22:13] <anthius> bekks i mean on my local machine
[22:13] <bekks> anthius: Yes. "sudo hostname mynewhostname"
[22:13] <kylescottmcgill> anthius: you run that in your terminal
[22:13] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: tried a different desktop that isn't gnome with unity shell?
[22:13] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, nice ... I just have the config in /etc/network/interfaces ...
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[22:14] <delphinas> but had some issues with graphics. Installed guest additions and it is better now, but still kind of laggy.
[22:14] <ActionParsnip> dpurgert: both are fine
[22:14] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: try a lighter desktop environmen
[22:14] <iceroot> my system (12.04) is telling me that my nameserver is 127.0.0.1. how to find out of the "real" nameserver behind is 192.168.1.1 or 8.8.8.8? nslookup is always showing 127.0.0.1
[22:14] <delphinas> I tried just mint, fedora and ubuntu so far - same gnome stuff
[22:14] <kylescottmcgill> delphinas: you could give it more resources, or use lighter Desktop software (Unity) etc
[22:15] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: those are distributions, not desktops
[22:15] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: install xfce4 in Ubuntu, log off and select the XFCE session from the login screen
[22:15] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, yeah -- google gave me /etc/network/interfaces  ... it's worked well, and I've not managed to break anything too terribly yet
[22:16] <delphinas> ActionParsnip, ok I'll give it a try, never used xfce!
[22:16] <dpurgert> delphinas, do you have enough graphics RAM for the virtual machine?
[22:16] <delphinas> kylescottmcgill, I gave decent resources! :)
[22:16] <Mrokii> dpurgert: Thanks, though I'm not much wiser now. :) Lots of ouput.
[22:16] <kylescottmcgill> :)
[22:16] <delphinas> 128mb - max I guess for me
[22:16] <delphinas> and 64bit with 4cores
[22:16] <delphinas> 4gb ram
[22:17] <RJ3000> hmm
[22:17] <delphinas> should be enough
[22:17] <kylescottmcgill> That should be plenty.. more than enough lol
[22:17] <anthius> bekks there is no name in either file
[22:17] <schep> Also, "sudo ifdown eth0" says "ifdown: interface eth0 not configured".  Is there a different way to restart networking now?
[22:17] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: LXDE i slightly lighter than XFCE
[22:17] <jhutchins_wk> schep: /etc/init.d/network restart
[22:18] <bekks> anthius: In which file? I told you to run a command.
[22:18] <delphinas> ActionParsnip, I will give a try to xfce first to see how it feels :)
[22:18] <anthius> host and hostname
[22:18] <SolarisBoy> is it possible to edit the short CTRL+ALT+T to provide terminator instead of the gnome-terminal?
[22:18] <SolarisBoy> *shortcut
[22:18] <bekks> anthius: "host" is not a filename.
[22:18] <dpurgert> Mrokii, yeah, tcpdump is pretty spartan ... iftop is nice ... actually looks like a commandline version of wireshark/ethereal
[22:18] <anthius> /etc/host  and /ect/hostname
[22:18] <bekks> anthius: This is a command: "sudo hostname mynewhostname"
[22:18] <anthius> bekks neitehr files contain anything
[22:19] <bekks> anthius: The first file doesnt even exist.
[22:19] <LudwigVonMises> strange error, my two page documents only print out the second page properly, and leaves the first empty. any tips?
[22:19] <dpurgert> LudwigVonMises, check that you've got the right printer driver set in cups?
[22:19] <Mrokii> dpurgert: Thanks, will take a look.
[22:19] <mistergibson> Question: is there a way to force a pkg to install despite deps not met?  I'm thinking glx-diversions here.
[22:20] <dpurgert> mistergibson, sudo apt-get -f install (package)
[22:20] <jrib> mistergibson: there is but you generally don't want to do that.  You should give more details.
[22:20] <mistergibson> dpurgert: thanks
[22:20] <mistergibson> well
[22:20] <dpurgert> also, yeah ... forcing installs can be "bad"
[22:21] <jrib> apt-get -f won't force installs
[22:21] <mistergibson> I want to get glx-diversions in, but they pre-dep it to a pkg that cannot be installed :P
[22:21] <troop> i wonder if we can interact with notification balloons? that means, if i click to message on notification, message windows will come.
[22:21] <ActionParsnip> yeah -f (f)ixes packages
[22:21] <jrib> mistergibson:   You should give more details.
[22:21] <SolarisBoy> woops nevermind got it
[22:21] <mistergibson> well, I need to switch the glx layer to fglrx away from mesa glx
[22:22] <mistergibson> that is the core of the desire
[22:22] <mistergibson> rather than go crack-monkey the files and cross my fingers (just to get hw opengl) I would like to avail myself of what looks like an infrastructure to do the switchover in ubuntu 12.10
[22:23] <jrib> mistergibson: so have you found documentation for glx-diversions?  What happens when you try to install it?
[22:23] <mistergibson> but they put a pre-dep to a pkg not in the std. repo
[22:23] <Enigma_> Hi, how can I get my microphone to output over the speakers?
[22:23] <ActionParsnip> Enigma_: like a sing along?
[22:23] <delphinas> Ok logging out to test xfce
[22:23] <mistergibson> jrib: when I attempt to install it, I get a notice about nvidia-installer-cleanup or some such
[22:23] <mistergibson> and it cannot be installed
[22:23] <jrib> mistergibson: pastebin
[22:24] <Enigma_> ActionParsnip, Like karaoke, yes.
[22:24] <jhutchins_wk> Enigma_: You capture the mic and you should get the output at the speakers, complete with feedback.
[22:25] <nsaquatics> jhutchins_wk: Not that I can find.. And intel only has the tools for Redhat or Solaris.
[22:25] <Enigma_> jhutchins_wk, I know that I want to do, just not how to do it.
[22:25] <dsathe> hey i just got a Lenovo Ideapad Y500, the usb just does not boot into a GUI

[22:25] <jhutchins_wk> nsaquatics: Do they have source?

[22:26] <jhutchins_wk> nsaquatics: you could try the tools with alien.
[22:26] <jhutchins_wk> nsaquatics: Shipping tape over the alarm!
[22:26] <mistergibson> jrib: see what I mean?
[22:26] <jrib> mistergibson: so, did you find documentation or not?
[22:26] <nsaquatics> yeah already have tape over it... still load as all out..
[22:26] <mistergibson> jrib: no, I did not
[22:26] <ActionParsnip> Enigma_: http://superuser.com/questions/87571/how-to-hear-mic-sound-over-speakers-ubuntu-karmic     maybe
[22:27] <Enigma_> Yea I found that, apparently I am using alsa and not pulse
[22:27] <jhutchins_wk> dsathe: Did you have a question about ubuntu?
[22:27] <dsathe> yes
[22:27] <ajp> hi all, i'm trying to run my script on startup through upstart on my ubuntu server. What do I save my job file as? and where do I put it?
[22:27] <ActionParsnip> Enigma_: what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc

[22:27] <dsathe> i cant get the usb media to boot
[22:27] <dsathe> i even got hold of the secure remix
[22:27] <dsathe> :(
[22:27] <ActionParsnip> dsathe: did you md5 test the ISO you downloaded?
[22:28] <dsathe> yes
[22:28] <mistergibson> jrib: I did find this : https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glx-alternatives/+bug/1072344
[22:28] <aLeSD> hi all
[22:28] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1072344 in glx-alternatives (Ubuntu) "glx-diversions broken in Quantal" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[22:28] <dsathe> it seems to be a know issue
[22:28] <ActionParsnip> dsathe: how did you put the ISO on the USB?
[22:28] <Enigma_> Im running quantal, its xbmcbuntu
[22:28] <jhutchins_wk> dsathe: Geting usb media to boot is up to the hardware.
[22:28] <dsathe> just to confusing
[22:28] <schep> Nope.  /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base now contains "nameserver 192.168.1.1", but I'm still getting only 127.0.0.1 in /run/resolvconf/resolv.conf
[22:28] <dsathe> nomodeset acpi=off tried all that
[22:28] <aLeSD> hi all
[22:28] <aLeSD> how could I install the plugin for ardour ?
[22:28] <aLeSD> is there something in the repository
[22:28] <jrib> mistergibson: yes that seems like the right place to look
[22:29] <anthius> thanks
[22:29] <jhutchins_wk> dsathe: That sounds like it's at least starting to boot off of the USB.  You have to tell us what's actually happen for us to help you, we don't magically know.  Very few of us even have EFI systems.
[22:30] <dsathe> ok
[22:30] <dsathe> so it starts booting
[22:30] <dsathe>  video.allow_duplicates
[22:30] <dsathe> says somethign about this
[22:30] <ActionParsnip> Enigma_: http://askubuntu.com/questions/123798/how-to-hear-my-voice-in-speakers-with-a-mic   maybe
[22:30] <nsaquatics> jhutchins_wk: not that I can see... still looking
[22:30] <dsathe> as this laptop has i7 with gma and a gt650m
[22:30] <dsathe> and gives up
[22:30] <dsathe> as in xserver wont start
[22:30] <dsathe> it get into command
[22:31] <dsathe> does ubuntu have support for a command line install
[22:31] <mistergibson> jrib: hence - I wanted to see about forcing glx-diversions into place, and see what comes of it (extreme measure I know)
[22:31] <dsathe> i need ubuntu for my work , arcxh or something else just wouldnt do

[22:31] <ajp> hi all, i'm trying to run my script on startup through upstart on my ubuntu server. What do I save my job file as? and where do I put it? and does this look right ?http://pastebin.com/xjACPjk4
[22:32] <Enigma_> ActionParsnip, Ill try that thanks.
[22:32] <jrib> mistergibson: there are two options: use equivs or download the source package and edit the dependency information.  Again, I'd strongly urge you to not do this and to instead research the matter more (figure out what happened to nvidia-installer-cleanup in ubuntu)
[22:32] <dsathe> i have been using nix since 2002 and this is just something i cant seem to get arund
[22:32] <delphinas> xfce is really fast :)
[22:32] <dsathe> goodamn ms
[22:32] <mistergibson> jrib: I have the nvidia-installer-cleanup deb and have attempted to install it -- it never installs
[22:33] <jrib> mistergibson: just make sure you have a backup to restore from
[22:33] <mistergibson> jrib: something is utterly broken about this pkg so THAT is why I'm casting about for anything I can do.
[22:33] <mistergibson> jrib: sure, sounds reasonable :)
[22:34] <jrib> mistergibson: you might also ask in #ubuntu-bugs has any pointers for you with regards to helping with the bug you linked
[22:35] <dpurgert> whoops ...
[22:35] <mistergibson> jrib: thanks :)
[22:35] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: yes, it doesn't use compiz like Unity does, and uses a lot fewer resources
[22:35] <ActionParsnip> delphinas: I always recommend xfce or lxde to virtualized OSes
[22:36] <delphinas> I was just thinking: is it possible to achieve same performance as installed OS, using virtualization ?
[22:36] <nibbler> can someone point me to some documentation about initramfs in ubuntu? in which order are the scripts under scripts/ executed? init-premount? local-premount? local-top?
[22:38] <nibbler> oh... its in the man page - didnt expect that tbh
[22:39] <troop> hello again
[22:39] <troop> i wonder if we can interact with notification balloons? that means, if i click to message on notification, message windows will come.
[22:39] <jhutchins_wk> dsathe: linux on efi has been working for a while now, it's just a bit harder to get right, and there's not as much documentation and pre-configured stuff for it.
[22:39] <sysdoc> The last that I heard there was no encryption for the files on the ubuntu one system, has anyone come up with a scheme to have the data encrypted prior uploading, and have the data avaliable to both Windows and Ubuntu systems?
[22:39] <jhutchins_wk> dsathe: Start with the install guide - I don't remember if there's anything on efi there, but there might be.
[22:39] <dsathe> jhutchins_wk: yea , i cannot seem to figure it out :(
[22:39] <dsathe> that does not work
[22:39] <dsathe> switchable grafix is the problem now :D
[22:40] <alami> hello, when i type on Terminal arch i get i686, is my CPU 64bit or my ubuntu is 64??
[22:40] <jhutchins_wk> dsathe: The advanced install does have a text mode.  Yes, the muliti-graphics thing is a royal pain.  Again, not enough developers have the hardware yet, and apparently the manufacturers have done some really stupid implementations.
[22:40] <k1l> alami: what gives you a "uname -a"?
[22:41] <Grey2> o/ i've got a really shameful question...is it likely I got a virus by opening a page on a website, and it opened like a hidden popup, but I couldn't find it..?

[22:43] <alami> hello, when i type on Terminal arch i get i686, is my CPU 64bit or my ubuntu is 64??
[22:44] <ajp> !upstart
[22:44] <ubottu> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[22:44] <bekks> alami: Currently you have a i686 Ubuntu, maybe on a 64bit CPU.
[22:45] <bekks> alami: You have to find you which CPU you have very exactly, first, by typing: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[22:46] <jhutchins_wk> OwiecPL1986: Have you verified the .iso image and the resulting disc?
[22:47] <alami> becks:http://pastebin.com/B1iHWpy4

[22:52] <jhutchins_wk> OwiecPL1986: Does that laptop use EFI instead of MBR?

[22:53] <skp1> and then a kernel panic
[22:53] <jhutchins_wk> alami: That you have installed Ubuntu 32bit i686.  i686 is a later version of i386.
[22:53] <OwiecPL1986> jhutchins_wk: i didint find information it use EFI so i guess not? I have clear instalation, this is new computer
[22:53] <calimero_> i 've chosen ubuntu+1
[22:53] <dsathe> OwiecPL1986:
[22:53] <dsathe> i think i sorted it

[22:53] <OwiecPL1986> jhutchins_wk: bug GUI doesnt detect anything
[22:53] <dsathe> just use i686
[22:54] <dsathe> does not matter
[22:54] <dsathe> so long as u got  a comp post 200
[22:54] <dsathe> 2000
[22:54] <jhutchins_wk> OwiecPL1986: I think you have to use advanced mode to use existing partitions.
[22:54] <dsathe> OwiecPL1986:
[22:54] <k1l> alami: why dont you post the info i requested at the beginning?
[22:54] <dsathe> where are you stuck atm
[22:54] <dsathe> the USB boot
[22:54] <dsathe> or grab the secure-remix
[22:54] <OwiecPL1986> dsathe: i am using 64-bit
[22:54] <dsathe> it takes care of booting into uefi
[22:54] <calimero_> the room doesn't appear
[22:54] <jhutchins_wk> alami: Correct, i686 is 32b.
[22:54] <alami> k1l i have do it

[22:55] <alami> k1l:http://pastebin.com/B1iHWpy4
[22:55] <jhutchins_wk> alami: 64b i sx86_64.

[22:55] <calimero_> i've done /join#ubuntu+1
[22:55] <alami> jhutchins_wk: tahnks
[22:55] <dsathe> i386 refers to support for 38086 processors
[22:55] <k1l> <k1l> alami: what gives you a "uname -a"?
[22:55] <dsathe> it's being dropped in linux 3.7
[22:55] <dsathe> just use 686
[22:56] <dsathe> infact use amd64
[22:56] <dsathe> most new laptops have it
[22:56] <OwiecPL1986> dsathe: details you can read there http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12442173
[22:56] <ActionParsnip> dsathe: i386 is already gone
[22:56] <jhutchins_wk> alami: If you already have i686 you might as well go ahead and use it.  There's no real advantage to x86_64 unless you're working with really big datasets.
[22:57] <OwiecPL1986> jhutchins_wk: What do you mean when saying about advanced mode?
[22:57] <jhutchins_wk> OwiecPL1986: On the installer.
[22:57] <alami>  jhutchins_wk: but i686 don't support more then 4Gb RAM
[22:57] <OwiecPL1986> jhutchins_wk: gui installer doesnt have any advenced mode?
[22:58] <jhutchins_wk> OwiecPL1986: Sorry, installers are a weak point because we usually run them once per PC, and unless we're turning out a bunch of PCs with various hardware it's hard to learn/remember all the details.  That's why I point people at the install guide.
[22:58] <OwiecPL1986> jhutchins_wk: if have i didnt see any button "advanced mode"
[22:58] <r0tha_> *the install gives you the ability to select what partitions should be crated for the install
[22:58] <k1l> alami: use PAE kernel, which should be default
[22:58] <jhutchins_wk> OwiecPL1986: I haven't run an ubuntu installer in about three years.
[22:58] <OwiecPL1986> jhutchins_wk: yes but when standard way doesnt work then is a problem
[22:58] <r0tha_> *i.e do you want /root to be on another disk
[22:58] <OwiecPL1986> jhutchins_wk: heh ok
[22:59] <OwiecPL1986> ok so mayby is other option? When i installed gentoo i just copy files and chroot. Any similar for ubuntu?
[22:59] <lorenx> hi all. i installed cinnamon on ubuntu 12.10. is there a better channel for a wm (muffin?) keybinding question? thanks
[23:00] <jhutchins_wk> OwiecPL1986: THere is no alternative to finding and reading the documentation on how to handle the new hardware.

[23:03] <dpurgert> that's not good
[23:03] <alami> bekks: but 32 is better, my os now is 32bit  I thought i686 is not 32bits
[23:04] <dpurgert> alami, right, i686 is the x86_64 variant
[23:04] <MonkeyDust> error_code  it says version 1.2, the one you need
[23:04] <bekks> alami: On 64bit hardware, 32bit/i686 is not better.
[23:04] <error_code> dpurgert: heh. yeah. pretty pissed to see it
[23:04] <bekks> dpurgert: Thats WRONG.
[23:04] <bekks> i686 == 32bit, x86_64 == amd64 == 64bit.
[23:04] <error_code> MonkeyDust: I try: 'sudo apt-get install php5-mongo=1.2 ' and get:  E: Version '1.2' for 'php5-mongo' was not found
[23:04] <dpurgert> bekks, and then ... i386 = ?
[23:05] <bekks> dpurgert: i386 == 16bit
[23:05] <OwiecPL1986> alami: if you have 64-bit CPU install 64-bit version, if you have 32-bit version install 32-bit version. Dont complicate this.
[23:05] <MonkeyDust> error_code  try 'sudo apt-get install php5-mongo'
[23:05] <alami>  bekks> i686 == 32bit??
[23:05] <bekks> alami: Yes.
[23:05] <alami> so i'm true
[23:05] <alami> my CPU is 32 and my OS too?
[23:05] <bekks> alami: No. You hgave 64bit CPU, but a 32bit OS.
[23:05] <bekks> alami: Your CPU is 64bit...
[23:05] <kyuubi> bummer
[23:06] <dpurgert> bekks, funny, wikipedia sates that i386 was shorthand for the Intel 80386 ... which was 32 bit...
[23:06] <Enigma_> How do I install support for exfat media cards?
[23:06] <k1l> alami: man, why dont you show a : uname -a ?
[23:06] <alami> bekks: you're true but i thing the last generation of intel like my CPU (i5) is 32bit and 64bit and both work fein
[23:07] <MonkeyDust> alami  what's the output of uname -a ?
[23:07] <alami>  k1l:Linux n105 3.5.0-21-generic #32-Ubuntu SMP Tue Dec 11 18:52:46 UTC 2012 i686 i686 i686 GNU/Linux
[23:07] <MonkeyDust> ok
[23:07] <bekks> alami: You thoughts are wrong. You have a 64bit CPU.
[23:07] <k1l> alami: there are no 32bit 4cores
[23:07] <OwiecPL1986> alami: 32-bit OS will work on 64-bit. Whats your point?
[23:07] <alami> bekks all new computer have 64 bits CPU
[23:08] <bekks> alami: And your CPU is a 64bit CPU too.
[23:08] <lorenx> i guess i'll try with mutter... is it possibile to set the "alt + left click" key combination to resize a window?
[23:08] <k1l> alami: you have installed a 32bit ubuntu
[23:08] <MarKsaitis> package description of samba4 in ubuntu - - SMB/CIFS file, NT domain and active directory server (version 4)---- what a load of bolex, this package isnt full and it doesnt work! Why on earth not say so!
[23:08] <alami> yes but 32bit OS work rearly good with a 64 CPU why do i need a 64 CPU
[23:08] <alami> i mean 64 OS
[23:08] <ActionParsnip> k1l: I'm gonna se if I can find one, just for kicks
[23:09] <OwiecPL1986> alami: 32-bit version OS with 64-bit CPU just cant never has the same performance like 64-bit OS. just only that.
[23:09] <alami> k1l: i have install it alone
[23:09] <apokalyptiker> http://windowsphone.bboard.de/board/
[23:09] <alami> OwiecPL1986: yes but the Problem is: some programe don't support 64Bit OS
[23:09] <alami> but thanks every body for this explaination
[23:10] <dpurgert> alami - really it only "matters" if you want/have more than 4GB of addressable RAM.  a 32 bit OS cannot address more than ~4GB
[23:10] <OwiecPL1986> alami: but 64-bit OS support 32-bit software
[23:10] <alami> dpurgert: yes that's what i say at the beginen
[23:10] <bekks> alami: Name ONE program that still does not run on a 64bit Ubuntu :)
[23:10] <dpurgert> alami -- missed that then :)
[23:11] <alami> OwiecPL1986: rearly: i have never try 64os .. :)
[23:11] <k1l> ActionParsnip: dont bring 30 year old cpus that wont fit in a modern laptop :)
[23:11] <alami> bekks: a lot on my company :D
[23:11] <bekks> dpurgert: Which is wrong again. 32bit CAN address more than 4GB RAM, but can address only 4GB per thread.
[23:11] <OwiecPL1986> alami: its no sense install 32-bit OS with 64-bit CPU. Just lose performance.
[23:11] <alami> OwiecPL1986: ok so what's the solution now?
[23:12] <alami> new install?
[23:12] <bekks> alami: Yes.
[23:12] <alami> what do you thing bekks?
[23:12] <alami> ohh :)
[23:12] <markovh> how does the whole launchpad work with debian/ubuntu bugs? Bugs don't automatically get imported to ubuntu from the debian bug center do they?
[23:12] <alami> okay but can i install 32bit package on 64bit os?
[23:12] <OwiecPL1986> alami: install 64-bit if you think about your linux really seriously and want to stays with this system for years? If you just trying new system can stay with 32-bit.
[23:12] <bekks> alami: Yes.
[23:13] <alami> OwiecPL1986:bekks: thanks a lot
[23:13] <alami> i understand now a lot about CPU
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> k1l: its an ANY CPU I can find thing :)
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> k1l: statement was 'there are no 32bit 4cores' :D
[23:14] <k1l> ActionParsnip: ;p

[23:14] <alami> pity that there isn't any way to upgrade from 32bits to 64bits :D
[23:15] <OwiecPL1986> alami: i am pretty sure if you have fresh isntall 32-bit it will be much faster if you reinstall with 64-bit then complicate howto change 32-bit system into 64-bit
[23:15] <dpurgert> bekks, that's only with PAE extensions (OK, yeah, that's relatively trivial ... ) but 4GB is still a limit ... and why limit one's self?
[23:15] <bekks> dpurgert: Thats the point where we agree again :)
[23:15] <alami> OwiecPL1986: i use ubuntu the hole of my life but i have never had a new computer that's my first time
[23:16] <alami> :)
[23:16] <OwiecPL1986> alami: so you have fresh install i guess?
[23:16] <alami> OwiecPL1986: yes
[23:16] <alami> i will reinstall for sure :)
[23:16] <ActionParsnip> k1l: UltraSPARC T1 can be 4, 8 or 16 core and be 32bit :)
[23:16] <OwiecPL1986> alami: why you complicate you live so much? ;) If you have fresh system just reinstall with 64-bit.
[23:17] <k1l> ActionParsnip: got me
[23:17] <dpurgert> bekks, yeah ... and forgive the generalization --> i deal with non tech-savvy people all day :)  it's easier to go with things they can understand
[23:17] <alami> OwiecPL1986: i will do it
[23:17] <ActionParsnip> k1l: fun game
[23:17] <OwiecPL1986> ok i am going read a book. For now my problem dont have any solution...

[23:26] <ActionParsnip> SpaceBass: is the system in the router dhcp clients list?
[23:27] <SpaceBass> ActionParsnip, yes
[23:28] <mistergibson> what is the actual format of a .deb file?  tar.gz?
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> SpaceBass: try removing it, maybe it is seeing the lease expire and sending the updated address from the pool
[23:28] <MonkeyDust> SpaceBass  and if you comment out dns-nameservers ?
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> mistergibson: if you grab a deb file and run:   ar x filename.deb     you will see the files
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> mistergibson: I suggest you make a subfolder to work in first
[23:28] <mistergibson> ActionParsnip: thanks
[23:29] <SpaceBass> MonkeyDust, I'll try
[23:29] <SpaceBass> ActionParsnip, thanks, removing the lease now
[23:29] <Awolf> Any help on how i can disable the onboard gpu ?
[23:30] <ActionParsnip> Awolf: in BIOS
[23:30] <Awolf> and use my nvidia
[23:30] <Awolf> ?
[23:30] <SpaceBass> I guess I can add a static map?but seems like I should be able to set the static IP on the system
[23:30] <adamk> Awolf: If it's an Optimus laptop, you can't typically disable the intel GPU.
[23:30] <adamk> You can check the BIOS, but that option probably does not exist.
[23:30] <Awolf> actionparsnip any idea in which section exactly ?
[23:30] <adamk> You need to look into a project called Bumblebee.
[23:30] <Awolf> i have an acer i5
[23:30] <MonkeyDust> SpaceBass  i've never used 'dns-nameservers' to give a static ip address
[23:30] <ActionParsnip> Awolf: BIOSes are wildly varied, you'll have to sniff around
[23:30] <Awolf> Ill check BIOS
[23:31] <SpaceBass> MonkeyDust, it's an alternative to using resolve.conf, I'll take it out
[23:31] <Awolf> and go back to bumblebee
[23:31] <MonkeyDust> SpaceBass  ok, wasn't aware
[23:31] <Awolf> must i install my nvidia drivers first ?
[23:31] <Awolf> or i can do it later on?
[23:31] <adamk> No idea.  I've never used Bumblebee and generally avoid nvidia.
[23:31] <Awolf> I am going to check BIOS thank you for now
[23:32] <ActionParsnip> I just avoid optimus, nvidia is great

[23:36] <Rhonda> Thing is, lxc seems to add masquerading rules for lxc, but the packets are nevertheless blocked by ufw, and I'm a bit lost in the syntax.

[23:46] <dpurgert> Salastil, it depends on what the source is.  If it's a CD/DVD image, you should be able to mount the ISO and start the install running from within the currently running session ...
[23:47] <dpurgert> if it's just a package (e.g. raspbian), then something like dd

[23:48] <Salastil> uh what is the apt name for DD?
[23:48] <Salastil> for apt-get
[23:49] <dpurgert> Salastil, dd is already installed on your PC, it's part of the base installation (though it's a bit of a "you'd better know what you're doing" program)
[23:49] <Loshki> Salastil: um, have you looked at http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net ?
[23:49] <Salastil> yeah I've used that for Windows, didn't know it had a Linux version
[23:49] <dpurgert> Salastil, you could also use the "usb-imagewriter" application (found via a quick google search ... I dunno how good it is)
[23:50] <Salastil> usually there is a "best" program, wanted to use the one that had a good rep

[23:50] <Salastil> since I've only used Linux for 2 weeks I was uncertain of what that was
[23:50] <dpurgert> Salastil, well, "dd" is the "best" (tbh, most of the programs in linux distros will use it, and they're just wrappers)
[23:51] <zvacet> Salastil: see if http://www.pendrivelinux.com/multiboot-create-a-multiboot-usb-from-linux/ is good for you
[23:51] <dpurgert> Salastil, apparently Ubuntu also includes a "Startup Disk Creator" that you can use (should be in system -> administration -> startup disk creator, according to google)

[23:55] <dpurgert> Salastil, does it happen to be a SanDisk drive, or have some "CDROM" drive as well (e.g. Sandisk whatever it's called)
[23:55] <dpurgert> ah! u3
[23:55] <cooflar_> ActionParsnip: I just installed linux earlier today, didn't have any empty dvd
[23:56] <ActionParsnip> cooflar_: not got a 1Gb USB stick, or an SD card?
[23:57] <cooflar_> ActionParsnip: So the next question :P Is nautilus the default file browser? Or do i need to download it? Well I probably have somewhere, but couldn't find it. Theres alot of downsides using wubi?
[23:57] <ActionParsnip> cooflar_: yes, its already installed. When you open and manage your documents in a file manager, by default it is nautilus. there are alternatives
[23:59] <cooflar_> ActionParsnip: Well, it worked like a charm with the windows files. You'll probably see me alot in here the next days :) Thanks man!
