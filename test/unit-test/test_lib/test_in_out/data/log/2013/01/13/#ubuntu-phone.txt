[12:57] <damian__^> hi, does someone know, will ubuntu mobile eventually be merged into ubuntu? so they are the same os? i have seen the galaxy nexus build and heard that you can simply bring it home, plug in a keyboard mouse and monitor and have a fill ubuntu desktop..?
[12:57] <damian__^> full*
[12:58] <damian__^> or will ubuntu mobile be a different os that also supports a full desktop?
[13:01] <robin-gloster1> damian__^: ubuntu moblie IS the same OS
[13:02] <damian__^> awesome :)
[13:05] <blackout23> yes that's the whole idea instead of going the microsoft route which means making a completely different os for the tablet, phone and desktop and slap the phone ui on everything
[13:06] <blackout23> anyone knows if there is a TODO list on what thing will go into the nexus image that will be released late february? Working software center maybe?
[13:16] <damian__^> im assuming until code is released we have no related documents? but im just assuming
[13:18] <damian__^> hopefully this will bring a new breed of devices/technology where we can just sit our phones in a dock or something and have a full blown keyboard/mouse/monitor pc
[13:19] <damian__^> or maybe something like the padfone but a laptop version
[13:19] <damian__^> being an android dev i find this all really exciting
[13:19] <damian__^> (and a nerd, hehe)
[13:24] <hourd> be cool to have something liek the motorola lapdock for ubuntuphone
[13:26] <damian__^> wow didnt even know it existed. i like :)
[13:27] <hourd> yeah, shame the phone failed
[13:27] <hourd> but a great idea
[13:28] <hourd> i can see it being used for ubuntu phone pretty quickly
[13:29] <damian__^> wow, you can buy a 11.6 incher for $60USD. and hook up a raspberry pi or beagleboard.
[13:30] <damian__^> maybe other phones can be made work with it, via hdmi out or something. interesting
[13:31] <damian__^> we so need an ubuntu image for the droid's, defies etc. time will tell i guess
[13:31] <damian__^> although google owns motorola now so...
[13:32] <hourd> they don't own all of motorola do they?
[13:35] <damian__^> from what i can tell they own all of it

[13:38] <damian__^> awesome! perfect for ubuntu mobile!
[13:39] <hourd> [Bimpressive
[13:39] <hourd> [B[B[B[Bglad to be of help
[13:40] <hourd> sorry about my terminal lag there
[13:41] <damian__^> i own the galaxy nexus and am patiently awaiting ubuntu mobile. just ordered a lapdock on ebay. $70 (cheap!!). you made my day :)
[13:41] <damian__^> np :)
[13:41] <hourd> wish i had a galaxy nexus, i have a desire z
[13:44] <damian__^> nothing wrong with that :) but even the galaxy is old news nowdays, with all the 1080 screened thousand core phones coming out lol
[13:45] <damian__^> http://clamcase.com/clambook-android-and-iphone-laptop-dock.html
[13:46] <damian__^> anyway bedtime. nice talking and thanks :)
[13:50] <hourd> oooo how about ubuntu phone plus an oculus rift
[13:54] <disharmonic> damian__^, Galaxy Nexus is relatively current still. It's not bleeding edge but it's faster than any midrage phone still. That will change in 6-9 months though
[15:27] <blackout23> The reason why I bought a Nexus last August was because Apple tried to ban the sale of it in the US. It's my first smartphone and if Apple hates this device so much it must be pretty kickass.
[15:28] <hourd> haha nice logic
[15:30] <blackout23> A friend of mine got a Nexus 4 a few weeks ago and I still like my Galaxy more than the 4th gen Nexus
[15:31] <blackout23> the AMOLD screen is just so much better than LCD especially when opening the App drawer with a black background
[15:31] <blackout23> on the Galaxy it's just pitch black on the Nexus 4 it's more grey
[15:32] <hourd> interesting
[15:32] <blackout23> speed when using the device is the same and the Galaxy is more robust when dropped
[15:32] <hourd> ive been looking at a nexus4
[15:32] <hourd> mainly the price is great
[15:32] <blackout23> if you have a GNex and don't use it for super intense stuff like gaming it's not worth it
[15:33] <blackout23> I hate having glass on both sides
[15:33] <hourd> i run on a desire z... its getting a little slugish and the keyboard is getting hard to use
[15:34] <blackout23> and the toch screen of the Gnex is better. Nexus 4 suffers from the same problems as the iPhone 5 where the touch sensor is embeeded in the display cells
[15:34] <blackout23> when doing a pinch to zoom it takes longer for the nexus 4 to register that you are moving them away from each other
[15:34] <hourd> hmmmmm
[15:35] <blackout23> with the Galaxy it is instant
[15:35] <blackout23> also don't like having Chrome as default browser because the stock Android browser is faster at the moment
[15:35] <hourd> im just looking for a phone which will run ubuntu now. the project has really got me excited
[15:36] <blackout23> me too I'm using CM 10.1 on my Nexus and everythiing is very nice
[15:36] <blackout23> but since I don't use any apps from the app store I'd switch to Ubuntu for having real linux
[15:36] <hourd> id gladly give up all my android apps for proper linux
[15:37] <hourd> they are all just make-shift for proper functionality
[15:37] <blackout23> I'm using Whats App but that is not crictical and might come to Ubuntu later
[15:38] <hourd> i hope ubuntu phone has a nice terminal on the phone interface
[15:39] <blackout23> there are 20 different terminals for linux I bet someone will port one of them to Qt with a nice interface
[15:40] <hourd> indeed
[15:40] <netcurli> there are also already terminal emulators written in qml like https://github.com/jorgen/yat
[15:40] <hourd> i use linux for all my day-to-day needs, so having it on my phone with the same functionality will be fantastic
[15:42] <blackout23> I might even switch back to Ubuntu or at least a Ubuntu based distro like mint from Arch Linux at least on one of my PCs
[15:42] <hourd> yeah im on mint right now
[15:42] <blackout23> I'm using cinnamon on arch. Really nice desktop.
[15:43] <hourd> yeah i use cinnamon too
[15:43] <blackout23> classical desktop is still the best.
[15:43] <blackout23> can't live without a proper taskbar where i see open windows
[15:43] <hourd> will have it on ubuntu phone too
[15:44] <netcurli> I use docky as a panel
[15:46] <blackout23> i tried some panels like awm, docky etc but wasn't really satisfied with any of them
[15:47] <blackout23> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=JISeFQ_1QzU#t=200s this is what I'm most excited abot. This device has the same hardware as the Gnex which is used for demoing right now.
[15:48] <blackout23> I always wanted a media center where I could show some photos to my familiy right from the Ubuntu One cloud but I don't want another box standing around.
[15:51] <hourd> thats nice :)
[18:39] <harushimo> has the phone been released?
[18:39] <blackout23> nope
[18:39] <k1l> see topic
[18:39] <harushimo> nice
[18:46] <atiti> damn end of feb
[18:46] <atiti> still a long time
[18:48] <hourd> want an early release
[18:48] <hourd> not that i have good enough hardware to put it on anyway
[19:05] <salmaan> Can we use GCC on Ubuntu for Phone? I have an application Fortran, which I wanna port to Ubuntu for Phones.
[19:06] <blackout23> probably i think there is an arm version of gcc
[19:06] <blackout23> sou you can compile stuff on your phone will take a while probably
[19:08] <salmaan> thanks @blackout23. You were right.
[19:09] <atiti> yea salmaan you should be able to
[19:09] <atiti> almost everything that you have on the x86 ubuntu has an arm version
[19:10] <atiti> except the closed source, binary only stuff
[19:11] <salmaan> @atiti, thanks. UBUNTU REALLY ROCKS
[19:11] <salmaan> .
[19:32] <hourd> most debian stuff works on arm, or you could compile it yourself
[19:32] <hourd> look at raspberry pi project
