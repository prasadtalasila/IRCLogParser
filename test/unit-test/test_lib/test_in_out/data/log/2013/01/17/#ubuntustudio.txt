[01:17] <jambeedrum> does anyone think i should buy cubase?

[03:16] <chia> hi from china
[03:17] <chia> the newly installed 12.10 amd64 ver of ubst did not enable intel driver for my i7 core graphics
[03:18] <chia> but that never happened on the same computer with ubuntu 1204 or 1210
[03:18] <holstein> intel is usually well supported chia
[03:18] <holstein> chia: shouldnt have to be "enabled:
[03:18] <holstein> chia: what is the issue?
[03:19] <chia> with ubuntu this is true; but with ubuntustudio not
[03:19] <holstein> chia: ubuntustudio *is* ubuntu
[03:19] <chia> i know
[03:19] <holstein> chia: whats the issue?
[03:20] <chia> intel is supported out of the box with ubuntu 1204 and 1210, as i can run glmark2 to make sure opengl is available
[03:20] <holstein> chia: do you need opengl??
[03:20] <chia> but after a fresh installation of ubuntustudio, no opengl
[03:21] <holstein> chia: if you'd like, since i literally will not be able to help/convince you, go ahead and install the 64bit xubuntu or main ubuntu.. test for opengl
[03:21] <chia> a proper driver is not only about opengl
[03:21] <holstein> chia: other than that, i will be back soon...
[03:22] <chia> when dragging the windows there is no double buffering
[03:22] <chia> everything is software composited
[03:23] <chia> so my question is, if the driver is not loaded, what should i do to load it?
[03:25] <chia> ubuntu 1204 1210 amd64 worked just fine, with intel supported, so i wonder why ubst didnt
[03:26] <chia> is there a way to manually configure drivers, or should i try install it again?
[03:27] <chia> back to ubst 1204 this is not a problem, so i guess i have to install 1204 again.
[03:28] <chia> without the support of opengl, BLENDER CRASHES ON STARTUP. what can someone do if he want 3d but cant get opengl?
[03:29] <holstein> chia: you dont need to "load" the intel driver
[03:29] <holstein> chia: then just come with the kernel
[03:29] <chia> but what should i do when it doesnt work
[03:30] <holstein> the kernel that is 64bit may not
[03:30] <holstein> chia: you should check for and apply all upgrades
[03:30] <holstein> chia: thats the first easy thing
[03:30] <chia> did.
[03:32] <chia> if this rarely happens, i guess i may just install 1204 and save both of us some time.
[03:32] <holstein> chia: then consider using what was working.. otherwise, it'll be about checking bug reports
[03:32] <chia> thank you for all the advice.
[03:32] <holstein> chia: sure.. wish i could help
[03:33] <holstein> chia: i think the best thing for you to do, is to take the *studio out of the equation
[03:34] <holstein> install vanilla.. or xubuntu, and enjoy the larger community of support there... then you can apply that to ubuntustudio, or just install the applications you need
[03:34] <holstein> chia: if you are not doing proaudio, you dont need ubuntustudio (in my opinion)
[03:34] <chia> fine. ubuntu and ubuntustudio, they should be the same but with different desktop env and software.
[03:35] <chia> anyway it's very good advice to try other distros.

[15:44] <computer> Hi. QjackCtl Just stoped working with this message: Cannot connect to server socket err = No such file or directory. ????
[15:46] <computer> Tried remove and install....But still the same message. ???
[16:05] <holstein> computer_: sometimes the devices can jump
[16:06] <holstein> computer_: what device are you using with JACK? how many sound cards do you have?
[16:39] <computer_> Hi. Just logged back in.
[16:41] <computer_> Intergrated sound card. Was ok untill started using a mixer....Then.....BANG......Well actually it just stopped working.
[16:41] <computer_> D-BUS: JACK server could not be started
[16:42] <holstein> computer_: i disable dbus
[16:43] <computer_> Also tried re-install of Pulse Audio. Tried that but I'm not getting any sound from guitar (through mic input)
[16:44] <holstein> computer_: turn off dbus and remove pulse audio from the chain for troubleshooting
[16:44] <holstein> computer_: have realistic jack settings for your internal sound card
[16:45] <computer_> Went in to windows and mic input is working ok there. Yes was working fine until used a mixer that comes with studio???
[16:46] <holstein> computer_: sure.. that could crash jack
[16:46] <holstein> computer_: you dont use that mixer anymore
[16:46] <holstein> thats the pulse audio mixer
[16:46] <holstein> computer_: you can use JACK for that
[16:47] <holstein> computer_: i need to run,, but check #opensourcemusicians if its slow here
[16:54] <bobweaver> Hello there I have been playing around with Ubuntu studio for the last couple of days and was wondering how to change the notify osd back to Ubuntu Default ?
[17:02] <wip> so VST under ubuntu-studio 64bit possible?
[17:04] <wip> like this VSTi (free) http://www.megavst.com/synth/icecream/
[17:08] <holstein> bobweaver: i just install the other notifications
[17:08] <holstein> bobweaver: i also sometimes use the compositing.. or xcompmgr
[17:08] <bobweaver> holstein,  no I am saying that it is installed already I just want to role it back
[17:08] <holstein> bobweaver: keep in mind, the normal notifications dont look good without compositing
[17:08] <holstein> bobweaver: role it back?
[17:09] <bobweaver> I am running unity 2d with opengl  atm
[17:09] <holstein> wip: you can fire it up and test
[17:09] <holstein> bobweaver: i just installed the normal notifications and ran them at startup
[17:10] <wip> holstein: will eventually do... but just to test i need to install libs32bit and wine...
[17:10] <holstein> wip: i was told, they work in 32bit.. i dont use anything non-native
[17:11] <holstein> wip: there are tons of ways to implement what you are linking in FOSS
[17:11] <wip> holstein: so your studio is 32bit?
[17:11] <holstein> wip: nope
[17:11] <holstein> wip: i dont use non native windows applications in wine for audio production
[17:12] <wip> holstein: what is lacking in ubuntu-studio / linux is nice soft-synth
[17:12] <wip> holstein: VSTi have tons of them...
[17:12] <holstein> wip: well, "nice" is a matter of opinion
[17:12] <holstein> wip: i can get those 8bit sounds with xsynth or why synthc
[17:12] <holstein> whysynth*
[17:12] <wip> holstein: i could spend a month trying to make one in puredata, but...
[17:12] <holstein> wip: or, a few hours auditioning the current ones
[17:13] <holstein> OR a few minuts in #opensourcemusicians with my friend [lsd]
[17:13] <holstein> OR try the application that is "all in one" that you linked and obvisoulsy like
[17:13] <holstein> wip: also, there is nothing preventing megavst from writing and releasing that app for linux/ubuntu
[17:14] <holstein> wip: sometimes developers are quite approchable if you offer to help
[17:14] <bobweaver> holstein,  do you know what the package is called or where it lives in dbus ?
[17:14] <bobweaver> the notify osd stuff is real ugly
[17:14] <holstein> bobweaver: "ugly is a matter of opinion"
[17:15] <holstein> bobweaver: i literally opened synaptic and searched "notify" and tried them
[17:15] <holstein> i settled on the ones that are in main ubuntu
[17:15] <holstein> notify-osd
[17:16] <bobweaver> yeah That is the one that I like to use also but I can not for the life of me figure out how to change it back to that
[17:16] <holstein> bobweaver: well, it never was that, so you wont change it back
[17:16] <bobweaver> It is like the whole thing got re-wrote I am guessing here that it is the schema file but I looked at dconf-editor and it is not in there
[17:17] <holstein> bobweaver: i just start it.. and i set it as autostart in my custom openbox config
[17:17] <holstein> bobweaver: in xfce, i just installed the one i wanted, and ran id
[17:17] <holstein> bobweaver: try just installing notify-osd, and running it via the terminal
[17:18] <bobweaver> It is installed
[17:18] <bobweaver> I am removing xfcenotify-whatever
[17:18] <bobweaver> xfce4-notifyd*
[17:19] <holstein> bobweaver: sure... i forget what i did exactly when setting that up in xfce.. last time i did it, i didnt have notifications
[17:20] <bobweaver> yeah it has made them all grey and the sound part I can not even tell that it is the sound by the icon because it is clured
[17:20] <bobweaver> blured *
[17:20] <bobweaver> I am going to reboot to test thanks holstein  :)
[17:22] <holstein> wip: http://wootangent.net/category/linux/
[17:23] <holstein> http://wootangent.net/2012/05/ruis-new-synths-synthv1-and-samplv1/ specifically
[17:23] <bobweaver> holstein,  worked like a dandy
[17:24] <holstein> bobweaver: cheers!.. i prefer them too, as long as im ok with a little composite
[17:47] <papy> hi anyone ! I got an asus n56vz, the Fn keys does'nt work on 12.10. problem is that it got a backlighted keyboard, and i can't use it. Has someone an idea to help me ??
[17:48] <holstein> well, you can use it without the backlight... but i would probably just try the main ubuntu live, and see if it "just works" and see what they are doing there
[17:49] <papy> ok do you know the command to backlight the keyboard ??
[17:49] <papy> i like the backlight, i would like to use it...
[17:50] <holstein> papy: there likely wont be a "command"
[17:50] <holstein> papy: there could be a package that is helping it work.. could be a package from the manufacturer for linux that would work
[17:51] <holstein> papy: i usually test with main ubuntu, as a troubleshooting step.. if it works there, then you should be able to see how to implement it in xfce
[17:51] <holstein> papy: you are welcome to hang here for help from the volunteers, but this is not an ubuntustudio specific issue, and you would likely get more help in an xfce channel/forum
