[18:51] <qwebirc19057> Using Mythbuntu Live Session Configuration and trying to connect to my backend I get. Failed to connect to database at 'mythconverg''@'myth'  etc. etc. Problem myth will not resolve to the ip of my backend. It needs to be myth.local. How can I change this, and where is it getting the info from.
[23:23] <qwebirc67503> Can I run mythbuntu backend as a live USB?
[23:23] <qwebirc67503> (I realize this is not a good long-term solution, but I'd like to test it out)
[23:23] <tgm4883> qwebirc67503, I don't know if that has been tried
[23:24] <tgm4883> you can try, i'm not sure the backend would start without some work
[23:24] <qwebirc67503> I want to try replacing my WMC, but I don't want to go to the hassle of opening the box and swapping HDDs, or messing with partitions, etc.
[23:25] <qwebirc67503> Would it work if I try to install mythTV on a live debian/Ubuntu USB installation?
[23:26] <qwebirc67503> What would potentially prevent the backend from starting?
[23:27] <tgm4883> qwebirc67503, I just don't know what is configured
[23:27] <tgm4883> IIRC, i think i did it once, but it was a few years ago
[23:38] <qwebirc67503> I'll let you know.  My Debian Live USB iso just finished downloading, so I'm off to try it out.
