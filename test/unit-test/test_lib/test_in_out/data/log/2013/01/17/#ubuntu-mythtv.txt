[02:01] <Seeker`> tgm4883: what time does the git?
[02:01] <Seeker`> :P
[02:01] <tgm4883> Seeker`, I know
[02:01] <tgm4883> I mean wtf was that
[02:02] <Seeker`> tgm4883: I have no idea
[04:29] <ubuntuaddicted> i am getting the following for some reason in my syslog and mythtv backend doesn't stay working? Jan 16 21:58:26 dell init: mythtv-backend main process (1621) terminated with status 251
[04:29] <ubuntuaddicted> Jan 16 21:58:27 dell init: mythtv-backend main process ended, respawning
[05:07] <qwebirc16309> I have a Hauppauge HD tuner...WinTV-HVR-2250. I found the firmware here (http://www.steventoth.net/linux/hvr22xx/) but I don't understand what I need to do with the extract.sh
[05:10] <Shadow__X> did you run it
[05:10] <qwebirc16309> I don't understand?
[05:11] <Shadow__X> did you read the readme.txt?
[05:11] <qwebirc16309> yes
[05:11] <Shadow__X> ok did you download 22xxdrv and hvr-12x0 and extract.sh to the same directory
[05:12] <qwebirc16309> yes
[05:12] <Shadow__X> ok you need to run the extract.sh
[05:12] <qwebirc16309> I just did
[05:12] <Shadow__X> open terminal and go to the directory that extract.sh is in
[05:13] <qwebirc16309> Ok
[05:15] <qwebirc16309> So once the extract.sh as been run there are three more files
[05:15] <qwebirc16309> Do I need to do something with these files?
[05:16] <Shadow__X> yes, i am looking for the write up
[05:17] <Shadow__X> http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hauppauge_WinTV-HVR-2200
[05:18] <Shadow__X> starting at making it work
[05:20] <qwebirc16309> I'll try the procedure...thanks for the cue!
[05:20] <Shadow__X> oh wait
[05:20] <Shadow__X> go to making it work easily
[05:20] <Shadow__X> or making it work using a gui
[05:20] <Shadow__X> sorry i missed those
[05:22] <qwebirc16309> I don't understand?
[05:22] <qwebirc16309> Witch GUI?
[05:22] <Shadow__X> go to the page that i sent you and scroll down there seems to be 2 easier ways to set it up
[05:23] <Shadow__X> there is a section on that page called making it work easily and right below that making it work using a gui
[05:23] <qwebirc16309> I see
[05:23] <Shadow__X> if you want you could use a gui to setup the card for you then once it is setup you can set it up in mythtv
[05:24] <Shadow__X> i would go with the easy way
[05:24] <qwebirc16309> I'll try!
[05:25] <JCii8> Hi! so I have a mythbuntu setup. about a month old. 12.04.1 i think. I foolishly updated system packages...now NetworkManager is stupid. Anyone else seen this? I've found with it for about 2 hours now.
[05:25] <JCii8> (by stupid I mean it doesn't get an ip address from dhcp. I can use ifconfig and set one...)
[05:25] <Shadow__X> JCii8: if network manager is giving you a problem i believe you could just remove it
[05:25] <JCii8> I tried that
[05:26] <JCii8> or rather, tried setting it not to manage ifupdown
[05:26] <JCii8> do you mean just uninstalling it completely?
[05:29] <Shadow__X> JCii8: what error are you getting
[05:29] <Shadow__X> is network manager not starting?
[05:29] <Shadow__X> http://www.ubun2.com/question/1287/how_fix_network_manager_not_running_error_message_ubuntu_1204
[05:29] <Shadow__X> that will get it running
[05:29] <JCii8> i min...system is rebooting
[05:30] <JCii8> and it's going to hang...
[05:30] <JCii8> side question, how hard is it to backup the mysql db and just re-install? will it pick up old recordings from disk if the db is restored?
[05:32] <Shadow__X> backing up mythtv db is pretty easy
[05:32] <Shadow__X> i would think it as long as the recording folder isnt touched it would be fine
[05:33] <Shadow__X> the closest thing i did to that was backup a mythtv db copied recordings to an external then setup a completely new system with the old db and recordings
[05:34] <Shadow__X> the only thing i had to do was change computer name some other settings and also i had to redo the seek times on the recordings
[05:34] <qwebirc16309> How may I have the permission to move some files in the file system?
[05:34] <Shadow__X> so in your case you should be fine afaik
[05:34] <JCii8> /var/lib/mythtv is on a separate disk...
[05:34] <Shadow__X> qwebirc16309: are you trying to setup the tuner or doing something different?
[05:34] <Shadow__X> JCii8: afaik you should be fine
[05:34] <qwebirc16309> Set up tuner
[05:35] <Shadow__X> JCii8: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Database_Backup_and_Restore
[05:35] <JCii8> so ifup eth0 works fine. /etc/network/interfaces seems fine. i did "apt-get remove network-manager" and it still isnt honoring the ifup/down stuff.
[05:35] <Shadow__X> qwebirc16309: using the gui its probably your best bet. But to answer your question to cp firmware to /lib/firmware you will need to do sudo cp
[05:35] <qwebirc16309> thanks
[05:37] <Shadow__X> qwebirc16309: do you know how to download the gui from github?
[05:38] <Shadow__X> you can just download the zip and then extract it
[05:39] <qwebirc16309> I'm on it
[05:49] <qwebirc16309> did not work!
[05:56] <JCii8> So in general...do people accept or ignore Ubuntu package updates?
[05:57] <JCii8> and does anyone have a ceton infinity 4 card...running with 12.04.1?
[05:58] <Shadow__X> i use the updates and use the repos
[05:58] <Shadow__X> i use a hdhr prime instead of a ceton
[05:59] <Shadow__X> qwebirc16309: which part didnt work
[05:59] <qwebirc16309> The easy part
[05:59] <Shadow__X> JCii8: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Ceton_InfiniTV_4
[05:59] <Shadow__X> qwebirc16309: the gui?
[06:00] <qwebirc16309> I' looking at that solution
[06:02] <qwebirc16309> Gui one did not work
