[00:24] <tsimpson> towels|deb: yes, it says so in the into video with sabdfl
[00:24] <towels|deb> So, do I have to use their little dev kit or could I technically just get their compiler and libraries and make one myself?
[00:25] <tsimpson> I'd guess the development kit would be the compiler and libraries anyway
[00:26] <tsimpson> I doubt you'll be tied to the development kit, you should be able to roll your own
[00:29] <towels|deb> Is it currently supported or no?
[00:29] <towels|deb> I think only Python and Javascript is at the time.
[00:29] <towels|deb> I'm not sure though.
[00:29] <towels|deb> I guess Ubuntu "apps" will work native on the phone too.
[00:30] <tsimpson> it uses QML, which is part of Qt, which is a C++ tool-kit
[00:30] <towels|deb> Yes, but they're using python packages and python code in the "tutorial" video.
[00:31] <tsimpson> I haven't seen those videos, I do know there are python bindings to Qt too, but it's all C++ in the backend
[00:32] <tsimpson> I would guess it's just easier to do tutorials in python, as there's no compiling/linking involved
[05:51] <nalaginrut> morning guilers~
[05:57] <nalaginrut> hmm...wrong msg for wrong channel
[16:39] <marxjohnson> evening
[16:41] <marxjohnson> I'm trying to write a QML app that plays sound, but when I try and use QtMultimediaKit i get an error saying it's not installed. How/can I install it?
[16:42] <commandoline> marxjohnson: QtMultimediaKit is in the qtmobility package if I recall correctly.
[16:43] <commandoline> (and qtmobility-dev for the headers I guess)
[16:44] <marxjohnson> There doesnt seem to be a qtmobility package, qtmobility-dev exists but that doesn't seem to be it
[16:45] <marxjohnson> I'm using the "Ubuntu QML toolkit preview" btw, in case that makes a difference
[16:45] <marxjohnson> http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/
[16:46] <commandoline> hmm, it probably does. That's Qt 5. QtMultimediaKit might not even exist in that anymore...
[16:47] <marxjohnson> ah
[16:51] <marxjohnson> so is there not currently likely to be a way to play sound in QML apps?
[17:01] <commandoline> marxjohnson: well, the Qt 5 way is QtMultimedia.
[17:01] <commandoline> http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtmultimedia/qtmultimedia-index.html
[17:10] <marxjohnson> commandoline: Ah, perfect, thanks!
[17:19] <popey> marxjohnson: seen https://github.com/ali1234/jono-qml ?

[17:29] <marxjohnson> popey: haha check your email

[18:06] <mh0> I asked yesterday but I never got an answer appear in my buffer playback today... How long does it take for a application to be approved to Ubuntu Software Center?
[18:07] <mh0> popey: Maan, that seems awesome!
[18:29] <qwertzui11> mh0: less than a week, depends on how much u've got to fix/change
[18:29] <mh0> hm alright
