[01:07] <harris> i dont understand that i am new to linux
[01:08] <holstein> i woud probably just move them over to libreoffice.. or something in google docs
[01:08] <holstein> harris: you can do that, but it will not be easy it will look like that forum post i linked
[01:08] <holstein> harris: its likely the files will just open in libreoffic
[01:09] <holstein> you can set up a webapp kind of thing like main ubuntu would do with google docs
[01:10] <holstein> OR, just explain what is going on, and let them open word and navigate to the file

[07:23] <WalterN> so I have Xubuntu on my laptop, and the only thing I really dont like is the click and drag without actually clicking

[13:00] <Aknot> Is there a program like kwin for xfce?
[13:01] <koegs> Aknot: xfwm
[13:02] <Aknot> i meant krunner
[13:03] <Aknot> lol
[13:03] <koegs> ALT+F2 should be similar
[13:04] <Aknot> It only finds applications
[13:05] <koegs> what special function do you need?
[13:06] <TheSheep> there is synapse, gnomedo, etc.
[13:06] <Aknot> it needs to find also settings and files
[13:06] <Aknot> and how do i install themes
[13:07] <TheSheep> !themes
[13:07] <ubottu> To change your theme in Xubuntu, go to Settings Manager » Appearance (GTK+ theme) or Settings Manager » Window Manager (xfwm4 theme) to change the theme - find more themes at http://xfce-look.org/ or http://gnome-look.org/ (for GTK+ themes)
[13:07] <TheSheep> ther is a guid on xfce-look
[13:07] <TheSheep> guide
[13:07] <Aknot> ok thanks

[18:35] <Guest66258> Will Hand Brake work on Xubuntu
[18:35] <arkanabar> if it's in the repos, I would think so.
[18:36] <arkanabar> let me see just what handbrake is...

[18:38] <Guest66258> How secure is Xubuntu from hacks and viruses
[18:39] <arkanabar> like any OS, if you install them, you get them.
[18:40] <TheSheep> !virus
[18:40] <ubottu> Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[18:40] <arkanabar> keep your system up to date, don't fool around with flash or pdf too much, and you're unlikely to get hacked.
[18:41] <arkanabar> At least you don't have the giant gaping hole that is "run ActiveX Objects" that Internet Explorer has...
[18:41] <Guest66258> Thanks for answering my questions
[18:42] <arkanabar> not a problem.  as for handbrake, it's not in the main repos, but I bet if you google "install handbrake ubuntu" you'll find a ppa or something.
[19:46] <sl33p> i got a file on my computer and i need help finding out if its threatening or not
[19:46] <knome> threatening to what?
[19:47] <sl33p> to my computer? tmp/ssh-DgevQKNx2104$ is the directory file agent.2104
[19:48] <Unit193> Nope, that's fine.  I have it too and it's used by ssh agent.
[19:48] <JDude> Hi can someone offer a little help as to why my live usb installation is giving me a "no operating system found" error.
[19:48] <Unit193> Sounds more to me like it's not booting from the USB.
[19:49] <sl33p> no i had it installed on a usb then installed to the harddrive
[19:50] <drc> If I had to make a guess, I'd guess that you placed GRUB somewhere it's not looking.
[19:50] <JDude> I reformat the usb to ms-dos(FAT) use unetbootin to install the 32bit xubunutu.iso, go into the bios and place the usb above the hdd on boot priorities, and when it reads the usb, it says "no operating system found"
[19:51] <JDude> keep in mind, I'm a little new to liinux. I've been on a mac for a while
[19:51] <JDude> but im not using the usb on my mac, i got a new samsung laptop.
[19:52] <JDude> drc: i didn't physically place GRUB anywhere. should I have? I just used unetbootin
[19:53] <drc> JDude: I was talking to sl33p
[19:53] <JDude> drc: oh my bad.
[19:53] <sl33p> drc i dont think i manually installed GRUB
[19:54] <drc> JDude: But in your case, I'd first try reinstalling to the usb...
[19:54] <drc> sl33p: what install option did you choose?
[19:55] <sl33p> installing?
[19:55] <sl33p> like, what do you mean specifically drc
[19:55] <drc> JDude: I've had the same thing happen to me, and re-installing to the usb often helps.
[19:55] <JDude> drc: yeah, I did that like five times with three different linux distros... don't know what's going wrong.
[19:55] <sl33p> drc: i tried to vim/nano this file and i just get errors im not even sure what type of file this agent.2104 is
[19:55] <drc> sl33p: when you installed to the hdd, did you choose 1) replace, along side, 3) something else?
[19:56] <sl33p> along side
[19:56] <sl33p> because i also have windows partition
[19:56] <JDude> anyone running osx 10.8 here? I'm getting weird behavior with unetbootin and am wondering if it is normal

[21:54] <petra89> I have got a big problem.
[21:56] <petra89> I installed on my asus EEEpc xubuntu before some weeks but now I would like to back my older xp.
[21:56] <petra89> I have got only usb to use for install.
[21:56] <petra89> I made a speciall install for usb .
[21:57] <knome> you should probably ask ##windows if you need help installing windows
[21:57] <petra89> But something is bad in master boot record...
[21:57] <knome> xubuntu boots though?
[21:59] <neolith> Hello everyone, has anybody encountered an odd video glitch when watching youtube using chrome in which only the video (not the commercial) plays with hundreds of various colors that looks like pixel based "static" (Hard to describe but have screen shots) this occurs no where else on pages that use flash
[21:59] <petra89> I have got only  problem hal.dll error
[22:02] <jhansonxi> neolith:  Google found: http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/07/how-to-fix-rendering-issues-in-google.html
[22:03] <petra89> How can I grub uninstall | or how can I make on first partition  FAT32

[22:06] <neolith> jhansonxi thank you I will give that a try... rendering, that's the word I needed!
[22:09] <petra89> Thank you jhansonxi. I used the same
[22:12] <jhansonxi> petra89: If you can boot the XP setup, try a boot repair
[22:13] <petra89> Yes I tried it but not good because I can see only usb partition.
[22:14] <petra89> I tried fixmbr command
[22:14] <petra89> nothing happened
[22:15] <petra89> so I can't see my 160GB harddrive
[22:16] <jhansonxi> petra89: It may need a driver for the IDE/SATA controller.  The XP setup prompts for installing one during setup.
[22:18] <petra89> yes perhaps , but how can I do to start setup.. only error with file: hall.dll.
[22:19] <jhansonxi> The XP setup won't start?
[22:21] <petra89> I start the 1. only text mode this mode start windows xp setup but I see only usb in xp partition table.
[22:22] <petra89> if I try 2. gui setup mode than I come the error message : hall.dll
[22:22] <petra89> than only choice the restart
[22:23] <jhansonxi> petra89: You could try wiping the entire hard drive with a secure drive eraser utility.  That would eliminate Grub and everything else.
[22:24] <neolith> jhansonxi thank you very much, that was the ticket, much obliged!
[22:26] <petra89> yes cuold you give me soem help how can eliminate Grub ? :)
[22:27] <jhansonxi> petra89: The XP fixboot option is the only way I know of to replace the Grub boot loader with the XP bootloader.  If that doesn't work then erasing the entire drive is the only other option I know of.
[22:28] <petra89> Ok thanks a lot . I have got an other idee that I try to install lilo and than try to boot xp
[22:35] <arkanabar> petra89, LILO is infamously difficult to remove from MBR.
[22:39] <j1mc> petra89: i found this:  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Master_Boot_Record#Restoring_a_Windows_boot_record
[22:39] <j1mc> it may be of help
[22:40] <j1mc> see if xubuntu has a program called ms-sys
[22:41] <j1mc> oh, i guess it's not in ubuntu. https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ms-sys/+question/28349
[22:47] <petra89> All right I try it big thanks to j1mc . I think it will be good resolution for me.
