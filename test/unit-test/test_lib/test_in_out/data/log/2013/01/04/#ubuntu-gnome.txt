[08:24] <darkxst> ricotz, I have gjs building against js188, but still rather broken, patches are here https://www.dropbox.com/s/c4zbelqognlrb2l/gjs188.patches
[08:25] <darkxst> plus you need the 3x RESOLVE_START patches and the other type changes patch from bug 690982

[08:53] <ricotz> darkxst, great!
[08:59] <darkxst> ricotz, great, might be a bit premature, but getting closer atleast.
[08:59] <darkxst> currently trying to fix a segfault in the importer, which makes no sense
[11:45] <darkxst> ricotz, can you rebuild js188 package without stripping debug symbols?
[11:46] <darkxst> obviously I can do it locally, but really at this point in time, the only people using it, are probably going to want the symbols!
[11:53] <ricotz> darkxst, i will add a *-dbg package
[11:55] <darkxst> ricotz, yeh that is fine if its not to much effort
[12:01] <ricotz> an extra package is better since it will be quite large in this case
[12:10] <darkxst> ok
[12:11] <ricotz> only symbols for the shared lib though
[12:11] <ricotz> the static libs will be stripped
[12:11] <ricotz> dbg package 25MB
[12:11] <ricotz> static debug would be +50MB
[12:13] <darkxst> that is fine, I don't think gjs uses the static libraries
[12:13] <ricotz> yes, just saying
[12:14] <ricotz> i want to avoid those additional 50MB
[12:15] <darkxst> yeh fair enough
[12:15] <ricotz> should be there in a bit
[12:15] <darkxst> ok, thanks

[20:08] <gh0st>  Again, to recap I just installed Gnome remix.  apt-get doesn't work. this is the error:http://paste.ubuntu.com/1496880/
[20:11] <jbicha> gh0st: um, did you read the error message?
[20:12] <gh0st> I'm not really sure what they mean?
[20:14] <gh0st> jbicha: I get errors even without the proxy. Will upload the error log in a minute
[20:18] <jbicha> it doesn't sound like your errors are specific to the GNOME Remix, there's a lot more people that can give support in #ubuntu
[20:30] <gh0st> jbicha:jbicha: alright. Just one more question . I've extracted the contents of the firefox tar file I downloaded online. To run the firefox executable inside, what do I do? double clicking it like vanilla ubuntu doesn't work. Using terminal produces the following error:http://paste.ubuntu.com/1496982/
[20:33] <jbicha> why are you trying to use Firefox from a tarball?
