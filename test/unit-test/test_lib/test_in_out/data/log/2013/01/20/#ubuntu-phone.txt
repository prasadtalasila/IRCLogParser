[15:23] <SpartanF31> hallo!
[15:26] <netcurli> hallo
[15:28] <SpartanF31> is known about the date will be sold the first terminal using ubuntu, and is true that the demo shown running ubuntu-phon was a Nexus?
[15:30] <netcurli> read the topic and go also to the wiki page linked there
[15:44] <SpartanF31> yea! it was the nexus 4
[15:44] <SpartanF31> the ubuntu phone. I truly like it.
[15:56] <ubuntubhoy> SpartanF31: the one they demoed was the Galaxy Nexus, not the N4
=== SkavenXXI is now known as SkavenXXI-[OFF]
[19:33] <twobitsprite> ok, I've read the FAQ on this, but just wondering if there's any new info on this (as I'm sure this is a quickly developing area)... any news on whether or not we'll have an image for galaxy s2/3 phones and if so, any idea when?
[19:39] <k1l_> you saw the /topic ?
[19:40] <k1l_> and the dev-phone is the galaxy nexus. so that image will be delivered for testing purposes at that mentioned time. what devices besides the gnex will get a testing image is not mentioned so far

[21:06] <israeldahl> QML question: Anyone know if the default ItemStyle.class: "new-tabs" colour can be changed to something else?  Can it be changed on certain events?
[21:07] <sladen> israeldahl: at the worst, if you grab the source for the component that you're using, it will have a changelog history and "bzr blame" will tell you the name of the developer behind it
[21:09] <israeldahl> sladen: OK.. bzr blame... nice :)  I might poke around here... the qml I import " Ubuntu.Components 0.1" should be here somewhere... just have to go looking I guess
[21:15] <sladen> israeldahl: qt-components-ubuntu ?
[21:17] <sladen> israeldahl: seems to be  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/trunk/files
[21:17] <sladen> israeldahl: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/trunk
[21:17] <sladen> israeldahl: bzr branch lp:ubuntu-ui-toolkit
[21:22] <israeldahl> sladen: I'm looking through the code now to see if I spot anything.  Thank you very much
[21:28] <sladen> israeldahl: try  bzoltan  on here in about 12 hours (generally around Monday-Friday daytime UTC)
[21:30] <israeldahl> sladen: I didn't find anything that seemed to contain it... I looked in all the ones I thought were obvious... I also check the c plugins... I wont be able to contact bzoltan at that time...
[21:31] <israeldahl> sladen: I guess I can just deal with the grey colours for now....  it does look a bit bad... but I have some other more vital things to finish in the program.... just thought I might ask.
[21:32] <sladen> israeldahl: which component exactly is it?
[21:32] <sladen> is it  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/trunk/view/head:/modules/Ubuntu/Components/Tabs.qml ?
[21:32] <sladen> which which case  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/trunk/annotate/head:/modules/Ubuntu/Components/Tabs.qml
[21:33] <sladen> shows that the main author is <tpeeters>
[21:34] <israeldahl> Yeah... but it seems   ItemStyle.class: "new-tabs"; is the most important part of the code.  It is the "new-tabs" bit that makes it all work.  Tabs is the oldschool non flickable kind.
[21:34] <israeldahl> sladen: I am not sure where ItemStyle.class is contained... I thought it would be in Tabs.qml
[21:35] <israeldahl> sladen: maybe in the theming things... I'll keep looking
[21:36] <sladen> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/trunk/files/head:/themes/Ambiance/qmltheme/  There are three files named "NewTab*"
[21:38] <israeldahl> sladen: Yes... that is it!!  Thanks
[21:41] <israeldahl> sladen: ah.. it is an image.... artwork/background-paper.png not a colour... I guess that answers part of my question.
[21:58] <israeldahl> sladen: it seems that changing that will require rewriting too much code for what I am doing right now....  maybe it will be in a future version... or I will get the time to re write the code to be able to use a colour instead of an image...  Thanks for your help!
