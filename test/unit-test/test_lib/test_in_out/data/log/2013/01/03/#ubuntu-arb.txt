[06:14] <coolbhavi> highvoltage, hey
[06:16] <coolbhavi> have integrated some checks of arb in lintian and m working towards some build time problems in integrating last 3 checks
[06:17] <coolbhavi> i.e lightweight arb app, deprecated python installation and maintainer script check
[06:18] <coolbhavi> hopefully over the week ll fix them and port whole arb-lint into lintian
[06:19] <coolbhavi> (with some exceptions though)
[06:19] <coolbhavi> wendar, hey
[06:21] <coolbhavi> I have a doubt, is there a possibility of a syntax error during build whereas the same passes through when checked manually
[06:39] <coolbhavi> in perl
