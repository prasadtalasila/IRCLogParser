[01:45] <holstein> sagitta007: just ask, and if one of the volunteers can help, they will :)
[06:24] <r4y> Ah, I am wondering about this setup for Ubuntu and how good the offer is. I mean it says quad core but isn't there draw backs of compatibility. My computer is having serious trouble and I also need a way to back up all my data from hard drives on IDE cables which I could try transferring through usb but will take a lot of work

[06:35] <r4y> I taking it that that deal has the connections for the new type of hard drives that now support 500 GB to 1 TB hard drive size which my motherboard doesn't have the capability for.
[06:35] <r4y> I don't know how long sata has been around but anyways I bought my motherboard in 2006
[06:37] <r4y> I figure buying this setup as well as a new hard drive will be better then paying to have my current computer fixed. What do you guys think?, but quad core. I am afraid, ha ha
[06:39] <mysteriousdarren> go big or go home
[06:39] <r4y> I don't need serious specs since I am a very old school gamer.
[06:40] <r4y> I think it is great though
[06:40] <r4y> I am home, ha ha
[06:41] <r4y> I meant to that like this. But I am already home, ha ha ha, wa ha ha ha
[06:43] <mysteriousdarren> good thing your home then
[06:49] <r4y> I will need to wait to buy anything because we are in a tight bind, but I know that is normal for most people. Everyone has their troubles. I am happy to just breath air, do yoga, drum, and so on. I can wait to upgrade to something reasonable. Perhaps the deal will still be around when  have the money, but there will always be other great deals
[06:50] <r4y> well anyways, take care. I bookmarked the deal just in case, bye
[13:01] <budmaester> what is best practice to format and organize partitions for Xubuntu
[15:56] <bodhi_zazen> I re-booted your VPS, I could not tell what was wrong with it.
