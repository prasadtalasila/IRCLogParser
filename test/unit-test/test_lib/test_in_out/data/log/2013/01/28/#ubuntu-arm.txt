[07:01] <tripelb> Someone should make a note about this channel and put it in the welcome text in #ubuntu I have a nexus 7 and was alone... Heh
[07:02] <tripelb> The nexus channel is dark and empty.
[07:02] <tripelb> That's all for now. I'll be returning after rooting,.

[07:39] <dholbach> good morning
[07:42] <vipzrx> dholbach:  moring
[07:42] <dholbach> hi vipzrx
[07:43] <darkfader> good morning all
[07:44] <darkfader> i'm new, didn't notice there's a channel until yesterday
[07:44] <vipzrx> welcome
[07:45] <vipzrx> i am in chinaï¼Œnow is afternoon in our country
[07:45] <darkfader> i'm gonna make a few nagios-server on your datacenter-entrace showcases with a nexus7 and see how it's going
[07:46] <darkfader> I have one running for 2 months now or so and except browser memleaks it's doing a great job

[16:48] <darkfader> some questions... does one of you have the GPS working in ubuntu? I have stabbed at it last year but no success
[16:48] <darkfader> i don't wanna get the position, just the GPS time for NTP
[16:49] <darkfader> i have a non-3g model, if that matters
[18:02] <randomblame> can someone tell me what the best way to compile ubuntu for armv7 on x86 is?
[18:03] <randomblame> rootstock is depricated and the qemu kernel panics during the process
[18:03] <randomblame> and correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think live-build can't cross compile
[18:10] <Riddell> about how long should it take to "fastboot flash boot" an ubuntu image to a nexus 7?  mine has taken about 20 minutes
[18:22] <Riddell> ogra_: is today's image too big? http://paste.kde.org/658604/
[18:23] <ogra_> Riddell, wrong image to wrong partition
[18:23] <Riddell> mm?
[18:23] <ogra_> img goes to userdata
[18:23] <ogra_> bootimg goes to boot
[18:23] <ogra_> the "boot" partition is only 8M big
[18:24] <Riddell> ogra_: where do I get the bootimg?
[18:24] <Riddell> oh I see it
[18:24] <Riddell> ok I'll see if I can make that clearer in the install instructions, thanks ogra_

[19:59] <randomblame> anyone have any advice for getting rootstock to work?
[20:21] <Rjs> darkfader: I'd also like to get a working GPS (and compass) for the nexus7... I tried but didn't get very far, though I found some parts of the solution:
[20:21] <Rjs> a) linux/arch/arm/mach-tegra/board-grouper-pinmux.c has a comment /* UART B : GPS */ and I think (from trying to understand the code in that directory) that UART B should be connected to /dev/ttyHS1
[20:22] <Rjs> b) apparently the GPS chip uses a proprietary protocol, but some Replicant folks have been able to reverse-engineer some of it in another device: https://gitorious.org/replicant/crespo-gps-utils
[20:22] <Rjs> c) the compass chip seems to be supported by the kernel: it has a directory under /sys already; but I guess a light bridge from this to gpsd would still be needed (at least I think compass chips should also be connected via gpsd to make them work in the normal navigation software)
[20:25] <Rjs> ... I tried to use screen to connect to /dev/ttyHS1 using various baud rates, but couldn't get it to write anything back... I'm not sure if I did something wrong (e.g., there is a cryptic termios.c_cflag in b)) or whether the GPS chip should be powered on by something else before trying to connect (the code in b) does some power-up specific to the device it was written for, not nexus7)
[20:26] <Rjs> or maybe the comment in a) is wrong and the GPS isn't connected via UART at all: some random googling found that a Nokia phone from around 2010 had the same GPS chip apparently connected via I2C, so I presume it supports both
[20:29] <Rjs> (are any specifications available for the chip itself? I didn't find any, and I presume not, if the Replicant folks had to reverse-engineer it, I think by running a closed-source Android app and capturing traffic to the GPS chip... :( )

[21:52] <darkfader> Rjs: i also couldn't connect to i think tty<something>2 which should have been the GPS line
[21:52] <darkfader> but seems you've been deeper into it. i can just verify it didn't work as it's apparently supposed to
