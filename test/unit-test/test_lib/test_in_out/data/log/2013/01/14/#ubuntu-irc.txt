[21:03] <JHOSMAN> Hello, everyone, my name is JHOSMAN, Ubuntu'm Colombia council and request I assign a Cloak
[21:10] <IdleOne> JHOSMAN: what type of cloak?
[21:10] <JHOSMAN> IdleOne: "ubuntu/member/nickname"
[21:10] <IdleOne> JHOSMAN: link to your launchpad account ?
[21:11] <JHOSMAN> https://launchpad.net/~jhosman
[21:11] <IdleOne> IRCC can we get some assistance here for JHOSMAN
[21:12] <IdleOne> JHOSMAN: be patient and someone will get that applied soon.
[21:13] <Pici> JHOSMAN: Can you please identify to your account?
[21:13] <IdleOne> JHOSMAN: you need to register your nick
[21:13] <IdleOne> !register
[21:13] <ubottu> Information about registering your nickname: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InternetRelayChat/Registration - Type « /nick <nickname> » to select your nickname. Registration help available by typing /join #freenode
[21:13] <Pici> Rather, register it first.
[21:20] <JHOSMAN> Pici: I do not understand.
[21:21] <Pici> JHOSMAN: You need to have a registered nick on freenode before we can grant you a cloak.
[21:21] <Pici> Ubottu's instructions above should explain it.
[21:21] <ubottu> Pici: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[21:22] <JHOSMAN> IdleOne: According to the wiki, I do it in a new tab freenode right? in that channel?
[21:24] <JHOSMAN>  /nick JHOSMAN
[21:24] <JHOSMAN> Pici, IdleOne I'm confused, in these steps.
[21:25] <IdleOne> is this the nick you want to use?
[21:25] <JHOSMAN> Yes =)
[21:25] <IdleOne> ok good. no space in front of the /
[21:25] <IdleOne> go to the next step now
[21:26] <JHOSMAN> In these two fields that I put?
[21:26] <JHOSMAN> step 2
[21:27] <JHOSMAN> nickserv and register
[21:28] <IdleOne> replace password_of_your_choice your@email.address with your password and your email address
[21:28] <IdleOne> /msg nickserv register is the command you are send to the server
[21:28] <JHOSMAN> OK =)
[21:29] <Myrtti> then check your email
[21:30] <IdleOne> in the email there will be one more command you need to send to server to complete the registration
[21:30] <JHOSMAN> Yea!
[21:30] <JHOSMAN> Complete! =)
[21:30] <IdleOne> well done, Pici ready
[21:31] <IdleOne> Myrtti: hang out for a minute :)
[21:31] <Myrtti> already ready to hit enter
[21:31] <Pici> Myrtti: do the thing
[21:31] <JHOSMAN> Everything is full?
[21:32] <Pici> JHOSMAN: Congrats
[21:32] <Pici> Myrtti: thanks
[21:32] <IdleOne> Congrats!
[21:32] <JHOSMAN> =) Thanks!
[21:32] <JHOSMAN> Now I login! IRC channels at all with my username and password right?
[21:33] <IdleOne> when you sign on to freenode, you do /msg nickserv identify PASSWORD
[21:33] <IdleOne> and your cloak will appear
[21:33] <Myrtti> or if you use webchat, using the login screen
[21:33] <JHOSMAN> ok Thanks! =)
[21:33] <Unit193> Best to use SASL or server pass, though.
[21:37] <JHOSMAN> I have a question, if someone tries to connect with my username, but not the key, what happens?
[21:38] <IdleOne> you can use ENFORCE to protect them from doing that. see /msg nickserv help set enforce
[21:39] <IdleOne> you no longer need the key that freenode sent you in the email. from now on you use the password you set to identify
[21:40] <JHOSMAN> OK! =)
[21:40] <JHOSMAN> thanks!
[21:40] <JHOSMAN> Bye!
[21:42] <IdleOne> later
