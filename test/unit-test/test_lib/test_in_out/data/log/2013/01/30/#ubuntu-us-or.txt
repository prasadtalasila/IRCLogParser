[06:28] <blkperl> slangasek: this is after a apt-get build-deb collectd
[06:29] <blkperl> why doesn't build-deb get it?
[06:32] <slangasek> blkperl: apt-get build-dep looks at the package indices to figure out which build-dependencies to install, not the current package; so any time you change the build-dependencies, apt-get build-dep won't do what you want
[06:32] <slangasek> blkperl: you probably want 'sudo mk-build-deps -i -r' instead
[06:32] <blkperl> hrm
[06:32] <blkperl> k
[06:32] <blkperl> slangasek: anyways its builds fine on raring for me
[06:32] <blkperl> slangasek: https://code.launchpad.net/~blkperl/ubuntu/raring/collectd/merge-from-debian/+merge/140116
[06:32] <blkperl> what do?
[06:34] <slangasek> let me see if I can reproduce the build failure
[06:38] <blkperl> thanks!
[06:50] <slangasek> blkperl: package built for me in raring just fine, too
[06:51] <slangasek> blkperl: and jdstrand didn't say what the configure failure had been, so I guess it was transient
[06:53] <blkperl> slangasek: ummm ok....
[06:54] <blkperl> slangasek: it would be cool if a bzr push, automatically triggered a build in jenkins or something and then updated launchpad
[06:55] <slangasek> that would require an awful lot of jenkins :)
[06:56] <blkperl> slangasek: openstack seems pretty good at it :P
[06:56] <blkperl> there gerrit -> jenkins -> launchpad intergration is pretty impressive
[07:29] <slangasek> blkperl: merged and uploaded
[07:30] <blkperl> slangasek: woot!
[07:30] <blkperl> slangasek: thanks!
[07:30] <blkperl> slangasek++
[07:31] <blkperl> slangasek: now I have to figure out what to work on next
[07:31] <blkperl> slangasek: can I merge puppet 3.x into rariing?
[07:33]  * blkperl will have to come up with a list of things
[07:56] <blkperl> or bkerensa beat me to it
[07:57] <blkperl> bkerensa: looks like your branch isn't proposed for merging
=== SheldorIsBackOnl is now known as SheldorAFK
[23:04] <bkerensa> <slangasek> [22:00:55] bkerensa: I suppose it would make sense for me to cook something like that up and make it permanently available, wouldn't it
[23:04] <bkerensa> slangasek: sure
[23:05] <bkerensa> blkperl: yeah I figured I would just merge puppet into a personal branch and not propose it
[23:05] <bkerensa> ;)
