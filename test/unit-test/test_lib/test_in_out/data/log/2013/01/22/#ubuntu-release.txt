[18:11] <cjwatson> I'd appreciate reviews of live-build/precise-proposed and grub2/precise-proposed, if any ~ubuntu-sru member has a moment.
[18:12] <cjwatson> The former is 12.04.2-critical; the latter has a user who specifically needs it by tomorrow to get some work done
[18:13] <cjwatson> (And is a follow-up to an almost-but-not-quite-working SRU)
[18:15] <cjwatson> Specifically comment #18 on the bug it mentions
[18:30] <infinity> cjwatson: Will look after I caffeinate.  Slow start today.

[21:44] <plars> infinity: are we expecting to see 12.04.2 rc builds starting this week? and if so, any ETA?
[21:47] <infinity> plars: We might start calling things RC this Thursday, but given the two week extension to the release schedule, I'd still expect a tiny bit of last-minute churn after that.
[21:48] <infinity> plars: It's mostly up to cjwatson, he's driving 12.04.2, but we're certainly not quite ready to close the doors on uploads just yet.
[21:49] <plars> infinity: I'm mostly looking for the iso tracker milestone to start pointing people to that for testing
[21:49] <infinity> plars: Yeah, fair enough.  Up to Colin when he decides to flip the switch on the tracker to call precise dailies "RC", but I assume it'll be soonish.
[21:50] <plars> infinity: also, did you happen to see my email last week about staging for iso testing?
[21:52] <infinity> plars: I did, sorry, I've been swamped with 73 things that all claim to be urgent.  I'll respond, I promise. :)
[21:52] <plars> infinity: understand, not trying to nag, just wanted to make sure that it didn't get totally buried in the wash of email :)
[22:04] <cjwatson> infinity: thanks
[22:05]  * infinity throws hello.dsc at sagari and prays.
[22:05] <cjwatson> plars: yeah, I think once I've confirmed that size is OK and once I've sorted out one last complex installer bug that needs to get fixed - so a bit later this week
[22:05] <plars> cjwatson: awesome, thanks for the update
[22:40] <ScottK> cjwatson: I have not.
