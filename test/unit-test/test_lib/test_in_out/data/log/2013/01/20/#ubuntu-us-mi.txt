[00:49] <snap-l> jhansonxi_: I'm of two minds about getdeb and playdeb
[00:50] <snap-l> Seems whenever I run any of the repos on there, I get into trouble.
[00:51] <jhansonxi_> snap-l: I've rarely had trouble.  Only time I can think of was with FrostWire a while ago.
[02:01] <derekv> damn this icu
[12:02] <tony-smlr> SMLR is Live Video: http://www.youtube.com/user/tbemus?v=XtFCJ8uU7SM , Audio: http://kwisher.dyndns-at-home.com:8000/streaming
[18:24] <derekv> monitor output on laptop borken, mousewheel broken, turns out android sdk in bsd is a big pita, fighting my way out of an update gone crappy, microusb port on phone has bad connection
[18:25] <derekv> i want all new stuff
[18:28] <brousch> derekv: I have been using adb wifi instead of a cable
[18:28] <brousch> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.wifiadb&hl=en
[18:37] <derekv> brousch: can't charge wifi though
[18:37] <brousch> heh, true
[18:38] <derekv> i hate the everything but one important thing law of operating systems
[18:38] <derekv> any OS you'd otherwise be happy running will work well for everything but one important thing
[18:39] <brousch> I hadn't heard of that, but it sounds true
[18:39] <derekv> swear to god one day i'm just going to be like, welp i guess i can't do that thing.
[18:39] <brousch> Well that's me and games
[18:40] <derekv> huh well i have two 1tb drives in this thing
[18:40] <derekv> thats plenty of room for multiple oss
[18:40] <derekv> os's
[18:41] <brousch> Of course you could work on providing the missing functionality to the OS of your choice
[18:41] <brousch> Which is what I'm doing with Android
[18:41] <derekv> what are you working on?
[18:42] <brousch> Python programming on Android
[18:42] <derekv> jython?
[18:42] <derekv> or native?
[18:43] <brousch> Using Kivy now
[18:43] <brousch> It compiles to ARM and you include the executable in your apk
[18:44] <derekv> are there wrappers for the android sdk gui stuff?
[18:44] <brousch> Then you can swap out the main.pyo with your own main.py and go to town
[18:44] <brousch> No, they use their own GUI. It's based on opengl
[18:44] <brousch> Kivy runs on OSX, linux, windows, android and ios
[18:46] <brousch> It's pretty slick, but a young project so there's some rough edges
[18:46] <derekv> i bet it does everything except one important thing i need
[18:47] <brousch> probably more than one ;)
[18:47] <brousch> So help us fill in the gaps
[19:19] <derekv> there are so many projects to potentially join
[19:20] <brousch> I know
[23:32] <snap-l> Evening
