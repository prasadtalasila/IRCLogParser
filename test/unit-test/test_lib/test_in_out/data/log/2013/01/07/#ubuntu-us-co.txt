[16:36] <system76chick> Happy Monday!
[16:52] <FunnyLookinHat> :D
[16:52] <FunnyLookinHat> system76chick, I believe you and Cheri703 were hanging out over the weekend...  :)
[17:03] <system76chick> Yes and now you get to meet miss Cheri today!
[21:23] <joey> FunnyLookinHat: I'm guessing the system76chick is Austin
[21:23] <joey> but I don't think I've met Cheri703 yet
[21:48] <FunnyLookinHat> joey, system76chick = Emma - customer service for S76
[21:48] <FunnyLookinHat> joey, Cheri703 is in the office right now - visiting from Ohio.
[21:48] <FunnyLookinHat> We're trying to convince her to move here...  :)
[21:49] <Cheri703> help me find a cheap place that allows multiple dogs and I will!
[21:49] <Cheri703> (I got pinged ;) )
[21:56] <joey> wow, I go to Linaro for 20 some odd months and the world changes. :-)
[21:56] <joey> Cheri703: http://www.housinghelpers.com/   is the way to go
[21:57] <Cheri703> nice, thanks :)
[21:57] <joey> Cheri703: I used them when I moved here in 89
[21:57] <Cheri703> ok, cool :)
[22:16] <Cheri703> I selected a bunch of cities on housing helpers' site and it freaked out at me >_> I'll poke at it later on
