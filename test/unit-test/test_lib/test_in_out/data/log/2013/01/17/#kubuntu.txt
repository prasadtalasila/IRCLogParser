[07:05] <nine_> ubuntu server or dibian?!?!?! why? as a server choice please?
[07:07] <Tm_T> nine_: hi, this is not a place for polls (and obvious answer here is Ubuntu anyway...)
[07:08] <Tm_T> !best | nine_
[07:08] <ubottu> nine_: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.

[08:26] <AciD``> hey
[08:27] <lordievader> Hey AciD``
[08:29] <AciD``> plasma-desktop is eating my 567MB of RAM, and it does so each time I restart it (and only 34MB is shared)
[08:30] <AciD``> for instance, I just restarted it, and the RAM consumption si slowly going up
[08:30] <AciD``> actually, it's already at 500MB
[08:30] <AciD``> 535, and stopped growing
[08:31] <AciD``> is the behavior normal ? it seems a bit much for just plasma-desktop (and I don't use any widgets !)

[14:11] <ovidiu-florin> rishubh: I don't understand your question
[14:12] <rishubh> ovidiu-florin:  how to know what version of KDE and what version of kubuntu am i using?

[14:13] <rishubh> ovidiu-florin: ok thanks
[14:15] <BluesKaj> for kubuntu version , opena terminal , lsb_release -A
[14:17] <BluesKaj> correction ,lsb_release -a

[17:13] <dlong> I recently switched to kubuntu.  Love the distro.  There are a couple things that I want to be able to do...1) Use kopete to access all my IM contacts but I need to proxy only google talk OR 2) use piding (which has the proxying ability) and be able to easily access contacts with krunner.  Is either 1 or 2 possible?

[18:13] <yofel> or can you pastebin whatever stacktrace you can get right now?
[18:13] <hpfrantzy5> its downloading other debug files
[18:13] <shadeslayer> you'd need kde-workspace-dbg I think
[18:13] <hpfrantzy5> ill let you know when I see something
[18:14] <hpfrantzy5> yeah, thats one of the packages being downloaded
[18:15] <shadeslayer> should be fine then :)
[18:15] <hpfrantzy5> i have a low internet connection, so this will take some time
[18:15] <hpfrantzy5> in the meantime, may I ask if you guys are developers for the ubuntu community?
[18:16] <shadeslayer> me and yofel? yeah :)
[18:17] <hpfrantzy5> nice, I am fairly new to linux; finally decided to dual boot rather than using wubi - big commitment on my part
[18:17] <shadeslayer> :D
[18:18] <hpfrantzy5> but I decided to go linux because I will be taking a course on functional programming, using OCaml, and it was next to impossible to get a good ocaml environment set up in windows
[18:19] <shadeslayer> ah :)
[18:20] <hpfrantzy5> I was wondering what part of the project you guys work on
[18:20] <shadeslayer> Kubuntu and KDE primarily :)
[18:24] <yofel> same
[18:24] <hpfrantzy5> nice, what implications does BlueSystems supporting Kubuntu have on the project? As frustrated I am with unity and ubuntu, Canonical does have the right connections

[19:09] <sbivol_> Since a week or so, no KDE application opens JPEGs on my computer. Kubuntu 12.10 with KDE 4.9.97. Does anybody else have the same issue?
[19:11] <sbivol_> apart from the usual updates, I did no changes to the system, since this is my main computer.
[19:15] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: checking
[19:16] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: Gwenview can open
[19:16] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: no problem for me
[19:16] <sbivol_> phoenix_firebrd: what Gwenview version?
[19:17] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: 2.10.0
[19:17] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: did you try after removing the extension from the filename?
[19:18] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: If the mimetype and file extension doesn't match, it creates a problem
[19:18] <sbivol_> phoenix_firebrd: You are right, it works after removing the extension
[19:19] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: in that case it is not a jpeg image, something else
[19:20] <sbivol_> phoenix_firebrd: PNG, as I see now. I tried opening them with ImageMagick and it worked, so I thought it has something to do with Gwenview...
[19:20] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: This is been there for a while
[19:21] <sbivol_> phoenix_firebrd: thank you for the hint, I wouldn't have checked the mimetype miself
[19:21] <phoenix_firebrd> sbivol_: yw
[19:23] <sbivol_> I guess a check in kdelibs like „if decode_by_extension() failed -> try decode_by_mimetype()” would be very useful
[19:24] <phoenix_firebrd> ya thats what i thought

[22:43] <BarkingFish> Hi guys.  Right - i misread top last night - i now know what the rogue process in my system is, and I can't find out how to kill it, remove what's generating it, or why it's going rogue in the first place.
[22:44] <BarkingFish> It's something called kio_thumbnail - and when I open my desktop, that nasty little annoyance slows my machine down to the point where it's practically stopping it dead by using over 90% of the available (2GB) memory
[22:45] <BarkingFish> it's only since I upgraded my kernel a coupla days back, and since I don't wanna downgrade, I need to figure out how to disable kio_thumbnail from running
=== paolo is now known as faLUCE
[22:46] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, have you isolated the package ?
[22:47] <BarkingFish> i don't know how to.  I definitely know top is showing kio_thumbnail as the cause though
[22:48] <BarkingFish> at the moment i'm having to kill it using kill -15 kio_thumbnail in a terminal, it's the only way i've found to make the machine usable
[22:48] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, after killing it, does it start again ?
[22:49] <BarkingFish> yes
[22:49] <BarkingFish> normally
[22:49] <BarkingFish> runs as if nothing was ever wrong :(
[22:52] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, according to http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-796875-start-0.html it's spawned by the package gtk-qt-engine
[22:52] <BarkingFish> hm.
[22:52] <BarkingFish> let's see if removing that would knacker anything else
[22:53] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, be warned, though; it might hurt gtk themed apps
[22:53] <BarkingFish> right, well that's that shot in the foot.
[22:53] <BarkingFish> i don't have gtk-qt-engine installed :)
[22:58] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, well, tried disabling preview in dolphin ?
=== BTCOxygen|1 is now known as BTCOxygen
[22:58] <BarkingFish> FlowRiser, preview is already disabled in dolphin. I've never used it
[22:59] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, any usb or cd-rom or other video/music/image media attached to your pc ?
[23:00] <BarkingFish> i have 2 usb devices - a usb 1.1 bluetooth adapter and a 1TB external HD which is unmounted
[23:01] <BarkingFish> brb
[23:22] <BarkingFish> sorry, back
[23:23] <yofel> I'm not really sure how to debug that, but maybe you could attach strace to the kio_thumbnail process and try to figure out what it's doing from the output
[23:26] <BarkingFish> yofel - it's only silly when I first start the machine - how can I attach strace to it when I can barely run the computer? :)
[23:26] <yofel> good question...
[23:27] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, so it hangs the computer at startup ... but after you kill it it runs ok ?
[23:27] <BarkingFish> the pc boots normally - i get to the login screen, everything is fine.  i login, and it falls apart like a badly made soft toy
[23:27] <FlowRiser> Do you by chance have desktop items enabled ?
[23:28] <BarkingFish> i would have more luck swimming through semi-frozen treacle
[23:28] <BarkingFish> desktop items?
[23:28] <BarkingFish> i have stuff on my desktop
[23:28] <FlowRiser> seeing the contents of your Desktop folder
=== Linux_Galore is now known as eeproms
[23:28] <FlowRiser> can you see folders and stuff ?
[23:28] <BarkingFish> yes
[23:28] <BarkingFish> but preview is switched off on those
[23:29] <BarkingFish> so it doesn't thumbnail anything
[23:29] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, i get a feeling it still runs ...
[23:29] <FlowRiser> BarkingFish, try disabling desktop items
[23:29] <FlowRiser> see if it happens again
[23:29] <FlowRiser> just relog
[23:31]  * Wizard yawns
[23:31] <BarkingFish> ok, i'll try.  let's see what happens. one reboot on order, coming up :)
[23:31] <FlowRiser> don't reboot, lol
