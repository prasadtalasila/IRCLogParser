[01:04] <ubuntuapps> hi all
[01:04] <ubuntuapps> how do i promote an app?
[01:04] <ubuntuapps> I have published a game on the oubuntu software center
[01:04] <ubuntuapps> but its not getting any purchases
[14:34] <airglide> Hello everyone, I want to create a file type for my program, with an icon and that this file is opened with my program how do I do that?
[14:35] <stqn> with a .desktop file I think.
[14:36] <stqn> or maybe not
[14:51] <airglide> yes I've managed to change the icon for the application
[14:52] <airglide> but not for the type
[16:08] <stqn> if I want to release a closed-source app in the ubuntu software center, I have to build and test it under ubuntu 12.10, right? or is it possible to do it under xubuntu 12.04 (which I’m already using)?
[16:09] <stqn> it’s using sdl/opengl
[22:59]  * aquarius writes another app :)
[23:14] <stqn> anyone writing a closed-source app? do you include libs (sdl…) so that the binary works on several distributions (games e.g. in the humble indie bundle usually do that), or do you build one version for every ubuntu release, or does one build work on all versions of ubuntu?
