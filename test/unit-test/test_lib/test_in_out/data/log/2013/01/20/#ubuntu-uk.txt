[08:32] <mh0> hi
[09:04] <kvarley> How can I turn off multiple workspaces in Ubuntu? And remove the switcher from the sidebar? I know this feature is upcoming in 13.04 but is there anyway to do it now?
[09:04] <MartijnV1S> why would you?
[09:04] <popey> yes
[09:04] <popey> in ccsm
[09:04] <popey> general options
[09:04] <popey> desktop size
[09:11] <meet> how do i check if i have samba installed.
[09:25] <popey> meet: dpkg -l "*samba*"

[10:23] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[10:28] <popey> yo
[10:32] <brobostigon> morning popey
[10:48] <kvarley> Considering upgrading my 12.04.1 desktop to 12.10, any known problems with upgrading?
[10:48] <kvarley> Also, new catalyst driver \0/
[10:49] <Azelphur> kvarley: seems to be very bad if your on ATI, I've had nothing but issues on all my ATI boxes
[10:50] <kvarley> Azelphur: I heard this too but my laptop was fine and that's running an AMD APU
[10:50] <kvarley> I want to upgrade, but don't want to break everything in the process lol
[10:50] <Azelphur> yea, seems to be hit and miss depending on what hardware you're on, my HTPC with a 5770 is fine
[10:50] <Azelphur> but my friends 7770 is pretty much a brick
[10:51] <kvarley> Azelphur: I'm all AMD so not sure if I'll risk it
[10:51] <kvarley> Azelphur: Maybe it would be a good idea to wait until AFTER I've done my uni assignment ;)
[10:52] <Azelphur> probably, I'm gonna upgrade my box but do it by keeping my old 12.04 install around
[10:52] <Azelphur> so if it doesn't work at all I can rollback
[10:53] <kvarley> Azelphur: Fair  enough :) seems wise
[10:53] <Azelphur> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer-updates/+bug/1087840 is what my friend on his 7770 gets \o/
[10:53] <lubotu3> Ubuntu bug 1087840 in fglrx-installer-updates (Ubuntu) "1002:9991 Unity Desktop disabled after installing fglrx-updates" [Undecided,Incomplete]
[10:53] <kvarley> lol
[10:53] <kvarley> And this is when having Unity becomes a nightmare
[10:53] <MartijnV1S> isn't that a feature?
[10:53] <MartijnV1S> Azelphur: ATi disabling older cards?
[10:54] <Azelphur> MartijnV1S: I wouldn't call a 7770 old :P
[10:54] <kvarley> 7000 series are new cards
[10:54] <kvarley> Released in like the last 6 months lol
[10:55] <MartijnV1S> Azelphur: The R7500 was an RV200 card, OpenGL 1.3-era :)
[10:55] <Azelphur> MartijnV1S: hehe, the HD 7770 is a new card.
[10:55] <Azelphur> http://www.amd.com/US/PRODUCTS/DESKTOP/GRAPHICS/7000/7770/Pages/radeon-7770.aspx
[10:55] <MartijnV1S> TOO NEW apparently ;)
[10:55] <Azelphur> indeed
[10:56] <Azelphur> someone should fix that bug report, says incomplete even though all the requested information has been provided
[10:57] <kvarley> since when was hardware too new for linux
[10:58] <kvarley> I'm sure we never had this problem before
[10:58]  * Azelphur shrugs
[10:58] <kvarley> Lame
[10:58] <MartijnV1S> kvarley: except in graphics and wifi land
[10:58] <kvarley>  MartijnV1S: Hmmm I guess
[10:58] <MartijnV1S> though Intel is good with providing new drivers before chips are out now
=== MartijnV1S is now known as MartijnVdS
[11:00] <kvarley> Lets hope more manufacturers start taking that approach
[11:00] <kvarley> Mind you Intel have a way bigger budget than most manufacturers
[11:01] <MartijnVdS> they're also VERY open source-friendly
[11:04] <Azelphur> Does anyone know of any cheap decent quality projectors? :)
[11:05] <Azelphur> (yes I know, world on a stick)
[11:05] <AlanBell> pick two
[11:05] <Azelphur> AlanBell: I did, cheap and quality :P
[11:05]  * AlanBell fails at counting
[11:05] <Azelphur> lol
[11:05] <AlanBell> pick one
[11:05] <AlanBell> actually they are all getting good now
[11:06] <Azelphur> https://www.dropbox.com/s/8w53jtnxpgwh99x/2013-01-17%2004.20.29.jpg is my use case btw, I'm thinking projector on that back wall
[11:06] <dwatkins> I wondered if there were any with bulbs that aren't hideously expensive.
[11:06] <AlanBell> I would be tempted by an LED one
[11:06] <Azelphur> yea, the LED ones or the new laser ones I think don't require bulk replacements
[11:07] <Azelphur> at least, from my limited understanding
[11:07] <dwatkins> excellent, much cheaper to maintain
[11:07] <AlanBell> if you need a big image you need a brighter projector
[11:07] <Azelphur> yea, I mean that's why I'm interested in them :p
[11:07] <AlanBell> very bright for rear projection on a translucent screen
[11:07] <Azelphur> AlanBell: well that's gonna be less than 3 metres on that wall
[11:09] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: http://www.screeninnovations.com/tools/projector-wizard/ :)
[11:09] <Azelphur> I was just planning on projecting it onto the wall, I got big white walls here so figured it'd work?
[11:09] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: or http://www.projectorcentral.com/projectors.cfm
[11:10] <AlanBell> Azelphur: actually white isn't ideal, a grey is better
[11:11] <Azelphur> I see
[11:12] <AlanBell> http://www.amazon.co.uk/PROJECTOR-SCREEN-PAINT-STANDARD-KIT/dp/B004N6XEDM%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJZBMY44CTEUFJIYA%26tag%3Dtheopesou-21%26linkCode%3Dsp1%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB004N6XEDM
[11:12] <AlanBell> might be worth getting a cheaper projector and some expensive paint
[11:12] <MartijnVdS> or a proper screen to attach to the ceiling
[11:13] <Azelphur> hehe
[11:13] <MartijnVdS> so you can actually use the wall for other things while not projecting
[11:14] <Azelphur> tis annoying how expensive they are, they need to come down in price :p
[11:15] <Azelphur> jeez its cold today
[11:16] <MartijnVdS> 'tis
[11:16]  * MartijnVdS went running
[11:16] <MartijnVdS> but only got 5km because I was freezing
[11:17] <Azelphur> I got up and looked out of the window :D

[12:12] <bigcalm> Goodness, it's the afternoon already?
[12:12] <Myrtti> http://flic.kr/p/dN2QqR ♥ wellies and socks \o/ cotton socks and wellies make my feet warm enough to bare the cold floor
[12:13]  * penguin42 doesn't see how people can have hard floors especially in days like this
[12:13] <Myrtti> kitchens
[12:14] <bigcalm> And bathrooms
[12:14] <brobostigon> bathrooms
[12:14] <bigcalm> And saunas
[12:14] <brobostigon> garage
[12:14] <Myrtti> I'd have hard floors everywhere if I'd have my way
[12:14] <bigcalm> :O
[12:14] <Myrtti> but then I'd also have a bit better built house too
[12:14]  * bigcalm shivers at the thought
[12:15] <bigcalm> Heh. Myrtti you'd have a Finnish built house
[12:15] <Myrtti> I find it ironic that it's about 20 degrees warmer here than in Finland and it's still colder indoors
[12:16] <Myrtti> and this is a relatively new house
[12:16] <bigcalm> Myrtti: it always comes back to the fact that we don't have this weather often enough to warrant the building specs you have in Finland
[12:16] <Myrtti> also, I meant to say cotton socks underneath woollen ones
[12:16] <bigcalm> Ah
[12:16] <bigcalm> Have you knitted socks yet?
[12:17] <Myrtti> bigcalm: as a one time investment that pays out when there's extreme weather, I really, really don't understand what part exactly doesn't warrant the building specs
[12:17] <Myrtti> bigcalm: those ones yes
[12:18] <bigcalm> Myrtti: when you don't have the weather, it's a waste of materials, time and money. But the argument could go on for a long time. I'm sure specs are getting better with newer and newer buildings :)
[12:18] <bigcalm> Myrtti: yay :)

[12:34] <Ambutech> snooze mode at winehq ????
[12:34] <penguin42> Ambutech: Can you get http://wiki.winehq.org/USB
[12:35] <shauno> works fine here, fwiw
[12:36] <penguin42> really? Hmmmm
[12:36] <Ambutech> Not available according to chrome
[12:36] <shauno> ah, no it's not.  it seemed fast enough because I used wget to see numbers for the speed.  but the returned document is an error
[12:36] <penguin42> twas working about 2am last time I was looking at that page
[12:40] <penguin42> you know, the time when I was thinking I'd go to bed and leave following it's instructions until today
[12:46] <shauno> time to go cache-diving?
[12:47] <penguin42> or perhaps time for breakfast and see if it comes back by the time I'm done :-)
[13:32] <penguin42> hmm, I obviously should have had a longer breakfast
[13:34] <dwatkins> yes, go have some crumpets
[13:34] <dwatkins> http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://wiki.winehq.org says it's down, too

[14:12] <daftykins> !
[14:12] <daftykins> oh :)
[14:12] <daftykins> heh, they get stuck on the border? :>
[14:12] <Azelphur> daftykins: they just recurse around inside one X screen xD
[14:13] <Azelphur> go off the right, come back on the left again
[14:13] <daftykins> haha, so you have to start them saying run on screen x for them to even appear?
[14:14] <Azelphur> no, once I move my mouse pointer onto either of my left two screens, I can never go back to the right pair :P
[14:14] <penguin42> Azelphur: How are they set up ?
[14:15] <Azelphur> penguin42: 4 screens, 2 twinview instances
[14:15] <penguin42> oh don't know how twinview works
[14:16] <penguin42> isn't it all part of xrandr now on the latest versions?
[14:16] <daftykins> i doubt even that can sort multi-card setups
[14:17] <daftykins> and worse still, 'The Azelphur setup'
[14:17] <Azelphur> yea, you can't do multi card setups on xrandr :(
[14:18] <daftykins> does it work if it's just one display on each card?
[14:18] <penguin42> hmm you might want to check that on the bleeding edge version
[14:18] <Azelphur> daftykins: dunno, I didn't try that :P
[14:19] <daftykins> aww
[14:21] <Azelphur> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/misc/2013/Jan/screens.png is how it works lol

[15:59] <Azelphur> Good news, xorg-edgers fixes the wrappy pointer \o/
[15:59] <Azelphur> Does anyone know how I might install the fix for this? https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz/+bug/1020830
[15:59] <lubotu3> Ubuntu bug 1020830 in Compiz 0.9.8 "[regression][GLES] wallpaper plugin does not build any more" [Medium,Triaged]
[16:00] <Azelphur> says it's fixed on there and in what version and so on, but I guess it hasn't landed in the main repositories yet, so just wondering how I get that patch on my system :P
[16:03] <penguin42> Azelphur: The fixed package should be built for raring and in the archive
[16:03] <Azelphur> ah, I'm on precise, can I get it?
[16:04] <penguin42> erm dunno; https://code.launchpad.net/~vanvugt/compiz/fix-1020830   has a link to the diff, and you could apply that to a source package yourself and rebuild
[16:04] <penguin42> whether it works on your version is a different matter
[16:05] <Azelphur> hehe, indeed
[16:05] <Azelphur> I wonder if I could just grab the .debs from here and install them, https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-unity/+archive/daily-build/+build/4224198
[16:05] <Azelphur> actually, isn't there some way for me to pull specific packages from raring down onto my precise install? I'm sure I read something about doing that
[16:08] <penguin42> you'll hit a load of version conflicts probably if you try to install a raring package on precise
[16:08] <Azelphur> aww.
[16:08] <penguin42> but you've got a chance of backporting the fix
[16:11] <Azelphur> penguin42: seems not, most of the links on that page don't work (yay)
[16:11] <Azelphur> oh no, just very slow on the diff popup.
[16:14] <Azelphur> penguin42: mind helping me apply the patch?
[16:17] <penguin42> sure
[16:17] <penguin42> don't suppose you know anything about hacking stuff into working on wine?
[16:18] <Azelphur> penguin42: not really
[16:19] <penguin42> damn, neither do I :-(
[16:19] <Azelphur> hehe
[16:20] <Azelphur> so what do I do with this patch? ;)
[16:20] <penguin42> ok, so you got the source to the package you need to patch using apt-get source packagename ?
[16:22] <Azelphur> penguin42: I'm not sure which package this applies against
[16:22] <penguin42> looks like compiz to me
[16:23]  * Azelphur apt-get source compiz's
[16:23] <Azelphur> penguin42: next? :P
[16:24] <penguin42> ok, so get that diff into a text file - make sure you don't get line wraps or anything
[16:25] <Azelphur> done
[16:25] <penguin42> can you pastebin that somehwere, that thing isn't coming up for me
[16:26] <Azelphur> the patch?
[16:26] <penguin42> oh yeh it has at last
[16:26] <Azelphur> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1552591/
[16:26] <penguin42> ok, great, now cd into the top of the source directory and do    patch --dry-run -p0 < yourpatchfile    what does it say?
[16:27] <Azelphur> http://pastebin.com/xGaXbt7y
[16:28] <penguin42> ok, now do sudo apt-get build-dep compiz
[16:29] <penguin42> so that patch --dry-run didn't actually change anything, but it showed it will go in ok, so the easiest thing is probably hmm,    do the patch without the --dry-run
[16:29] <Azelphur> righto
[16:29] <Azelphur> done
[16:31] <penguin42> ok, now cd into the source dir and run debuild
[16:31] <penguin42> if you haven't got it it's in devscripts
[16:34] <penguin42> Azelphur: It'll give an error about something like unexpected changes and tell you the command to run to fix it
[16:34] <Azelphur> fun, it's still running atm
[16:35] <penguin42> oh and you might want to do an   export DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=parallel=10
[16:35] <penguin42> equivalent of make -j
[16:37] <Azelphur> haha, bit late now it's still chugging along :P
[16:38] <daftykins> lies, ctrl+c!
[16:39] <Neoti_Desktop> Hi Folks, Whats the recommend Operating system for Kdenlive? and what are some general getting started best practases?
[16:40] <daftykins> Neoti_Desktop: looks like Ubuntu has it
[16:40] <daftykins> http://userbase.kde.org/Kdenlive/Manual/Installation#Debian.2C_Ubuntu_and_derivatives
[16:41] <daftykins> though given as it's KDE, 'kubuntu' might be wise
[16:41] <Neoti_Desktop> with out sounding off. i know ubuntu has it but id like to know what the recommended OS of choice is for it...  :)
[16:42] <daftykins> maybe ask them
[16:42] <daftykins> they made it :D
[16:42] <Neoti_Desktop> right kubuntu.. i'll have a play with that.... yeah i have asked the question on IRC of them so many times but keep getting ignored.... :(
[16:43] <penguin42> you can mix and match; kde apps work under gnome etc
[16:44] <daftykins> it would involve downloading a bunch more libs though, right?
[16:44] <penguin42> probably, but less than reinstalling with the other one
[16:44] <penguin42> so if you have gnome installed just install the app you want and all the associated libs will download as well
[16:46] <Azelphur> this takes a long time xD
[16:46] <Neoti_Desktop> reason i am asking is i keep getting some rendering problems, like blocks and stuff appear in the video all over the screen no matter what i do, and no matter what the input is or render output... so i would like to know a recommended/most supported Kdenlive OS, so that when/if i have problems i can get some "support" etc... i have been using Ubuntu for years , not on 12.10 yet.. im giving it a few more months for al
[16:47] <penguin42> Azelphur: yeh that's why the parallel option is good :-)
[16:47] <daftykins> Neoti_Desktop: is your system stable? memtests clean?
[16:47] <Neoti_Desktop> yep, the system is stable and clean... i have made sure..
[16:50] <penguin42> Neoti_Desktop: Are they in the produced video or just in what it shows while using the editor?
[16:51] <Azelphur> ok it's done, said it failed to sign it
[16:51] <Azelphur> but apart from that I think it went through
[16:52] <penguin42> Azelphur: OK, that's normal - you should find some .deb's in the directory above it
[16:53] <Azelphur> yep
[16:53] <Azelphur> install *.deb, profit?
[16:53] <penguin42> good luck :-)
[16:56] <Azelphur> penguin42: well I installed em, but yea wallpaper still don't build :(
[16:56] <Azelphur> oh hey, but I have wallpaper now
[16:56] <Azelphur> can't complain xD
[16:56] <Neoti_Desktop> its in the monitor and render
[16:57] <Azelphur> yep, success
[16:57] <Azelphur> ty :)
[16:57] <penguin42> ok
[17:04] <SuperEngineer> UbuntuOne music question - purchased stuff download not finished , am I safe to shut link & continue later? [as in normal sync behaviour]
[17:04] <SuperEngineer> Speed here is currently so slow I need to switch to 3G dongle
[17:07] <MartijnVdS> SuperEngineer: yes -- downloads go to Ubuntu One storage
[17:07] <MartijnVdS> so when you come back later it'll sync it up with your disk
[17:08] <SuperEngineer> MartijnVdS: thanks
[17:08] <SuperEngineer> -time to drop conxn & use dongle methinks ;)
[17:08] <SuperEngineer> bbs
[17:12] <Azelphur> wow, compiz in 12.10 is terrible
[17:13] <Azelphur> step 1) remove all the features, step 2) here you go
[17:13] <Azelphur> that be disappointing :(
[17:13] <SuperEngineer> Thanks MartijnVdS ... downloads now continuing [SuperEngineer hugs his Three dongle!]
[17:50] <popey> Azelphur: which features?
[18:15] <jacobw> i don't compiz changed much from a user's perspective between precise and quantal
[18:47] <ali1234> nothing was actually removed. the default options were changed
[18:47] <ali1234> the non-unity defaults that is
[18:48] <ali1234> literally every plugin is disabled so now if yo run compiz without unity you can't even drag windows or have window decorations, unless you enable all the plugins manually
[19:26] <jacobw> ali1234: huh? why did they do that?
[19:26] <ali1234> probably the same reason they broke empathy for non-unity users
[19:33] <jacobw> bleh
[20:19] <AlanBell> well it is because unity conflicts with everything because it implements stuff like a switcher and decorations
[20:21] <popey> well we won't have to worry about that much longer will we (unless you're on 12.04)
[20:21] <AlanBell> hmm?
[20:22] <popey> well, Sam isn't up for porting compiz to wayland..
[20:22] <popey> and Unity is (currently) a compiz plugin...
[20:22] <popey> 2+2=
[20:22] <AlanBell> oh, but 13.04 is compiz again though
[20:23] <popey> true
[20:23] <popey> but 12.04 will outlive 13.04
[20:23] <jacobw> sam?
[20:24] <AlanBell> and after judgement day there will just be cockroaches and 12.04
[20:24] <AlanBell> jacobw: compiz engineer smspillaz
[20:25] <jacobw> i think i read about him leaving canonical recently
[20:25] <AlanBell> he did
[20:25] <popey> you did
[20:25] <popey> well, you may have, he did ☺
[20:25] <jacobw> :)
[20:27] <jacobw> perhaps the development of not-compiz will be better for unity
[20:27] <popey> perhaps
[20:27] <mh0> Keeping it a plugin makes it depend on compiz.
[20:27] <popey> It doesn't have to though
[20:27] <mh0> What if compiz's developers were to magically disappear? ;)
[20:27] <AlanBell> mh0: they have in effect
[20:27] <jacobw> bus factors are a fact of life
[20:27] <popey> Unity has existed in 4 separate ports
[20:27] <mh0> AlanBell: I guess
[20:28] <popey> so another one isn't going to make a lot of difference :D
[20:29] <AlanBell> gnome shell extensions \o/
[20:29] <AlanBell> maybe not
[20:29]  * jacobw hopes unity is ported to QT (again, or the previous port is reused) to support wayland, QT and QML for app development
[20:30] <AlanBell> jacobw: that is likely, given the phone stuff and the claims that it is a single system across all platforms
[20:30] <AlanBell> I think reality may catch up with the marketing
[20:32] <jacobw> i really hope NIH about QT doesn't kill standardization on QT/QML as a platform for 'app development'
[20:32] <AlanBell> who else is using QT now?
[20:32] <popey> jolla
[20:32] <popey> RIM
[20:33] <popey> KDE Plasma
[20:33] <popey> I was surprised to hear Firefox OS uses gecko
[20:33] <AlanBell> it was called "boot to gecko" up to recently
[20:33] <popey> oh yeah ☺
[20:34] <AlanBell> B2G is all over the documentation and wiki
[20:34] <popey> odd choice
[20:34] <popey> unless the competition can make gecko and webkit better
[20:35] <mgdm> did you see the post by one of the Safari guys about when Steve Jobs unveiled KHTML as the renderer for Safari over Gecko?
[20:35] <AlanBell> dunno, mozilla know gecko, everyone knows how to write stuff for gecko
[20:35] <jacobw> um, i'm not suprised that mozilla is using gecko
[20:35] <mgdm> I'd have been very surprised if they hadn't used it
[20:35] <AlanBell> XUL works fine, I was a bit disappointed that it wasn't pushed further
[20:36] <jacobw> mgdm: i'd be interested to see that
[20:37] <mgdm> jacobw: http://donmelton.com/2013/01/10/safari-is-released-to-the-world/ - the last couple of paragraphs are entertaining
[20:42] <jacobw> mgdm: nice
[20:46] <jacobw> i thought it'd an ancient post from 2003
[20:46] <mgdm> the guy has a series of them, I think, recently

[22:25] <Laney> a hole forms
[22:45] <neuro> Chrome!!! *shakes fist*
[23:06] <mgdm> neuro: what's up with it?
[23:07] <neuro> it went into full screen mode and wouldn't come out
[23:07] <neuro> quit it, restarted it and it went back into full screen mode
[23:07] <neuro> the second restart seemed to have brought it to its senses
[23:07] <mgdm> hmm
[23:10] <neuro> i'm supposed to have an interview for dell secureworks tomorrow btw
[23:10] <mgdm> oooh, cool
[23:10] <neuro> i say supposed to because the recruiter didn't get back to me on friday to confirm where i'm actually going
[23:10] <mgdm> break a leg, etc
[23:10] <neuro> so i know tomorrow at 1pm i have an interview
[23:10] <neuro> i just don't know where or with whom :P
[23:10] <mgdm> not sure if that's meant to be PM? :)
[23:10] <mgdm> heh
[23:11] <neuro> na
[23:11] <neuro> i'm a blabber
[23:11] <mgdm> I saw a sysadminy job going somewhere nearby recently
[23:11] <mgdm> I'll see if I can find it
[23:11] <neuro> nearby to ... ?
[23:11] <mgdm> I think it was Edinburgh
[23:11] <mgdm> or environs
[23:12] <neuro> k :)
[23:12] <neuro> was it red61?
[23:12] <mgdm> doesn't ring a bell - though I suspect it was via a recruiter
