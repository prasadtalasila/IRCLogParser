[00:00] <Cheri703> I am generally wary of both dell and HP from my days of fixing peoples' laptops... :/
[00:01] <Cheri703> so...WHY dell?
[00:01] <Cheri703> and WHY hp?
[00:07] <jrgifford> do i know any drupal people in NEO?
[00:07] <jrgifford> skellat: ?
[00:08] <jrgifford> Cheri703: a company i know uses entirely dell.
[00:08] <jrgifford> they *pay* for support, but man, do they get it.
[00:08] <jrgifford> and they are happy with 'em. as a consumer, give me a thinkpad any day.
[00:11] <Cheri703> yeah, I'm sort of leaning toward lenovo, but....not sure
[00:15] <Unit193> jrgifford: I hate drupal, if that counts.  :P
[02:38] <skellat> jrgifford: What did you want to know about the Drupal?
[02:52]  * skellat wanders off again
[03:02] <canthus13> jrgifford: canthus13.com is running on drupal.  I don't have any complaints so far.
[07:44] <Unit193> jrgifford: Didn't you use inxi?
[15:07] <jrgifford> Unit193:  nope.
