[10:31] <mvt007geek> hey guys please help me/. i wrote ubuntu on sd card but panda doesn't boot it.and serialport shows nothong
[10:32] <mvt007geek> i mean pandaboard
[10:40] <V155> mvt007geek: do you also copied the kernel image into the bootsector? On my arm platform (but not panda board) this is needed
[10:42] <mvt007geek> all i did to sdcard was this: dd if=ubuntu-12.04-preinstalled-desktop-armhf+omap4.img of=/dev/sdb
[10:45] <V155> mvt007geek: perhaps you will find your answer here: http://www.eewiki.net/display/linuxonarm/PandaBoard
[10:50]  * [mbm] has seen issues before where people try to use mobile phones and other linux devices as sd card writers, ends up mangling the write

[12:01] <Ethernin> Hey all you awesome devs in here, the latest raring build for the nexus7 seems to be pretty broken...
[12:01] <Ethernin> after flashing with fastboot, the installer is pretty fubard...
[12:02] <Ethernin> the display behind the installer is totally whacked white multi-colored
[12:02] <Ethernin> and once you get to the user setup things constantly freeze especially when you try to type a user name...
[12:03] <Ethernin> bueler?
[12:03] <Ethernin> :P
[12:08]  * xnox is sad, because I couldn't find my ac100 charger over the weekend =(
[12:25] <ogra_> xnox, i think thinkpad chargers work for the ac100, iirc infinity used that in the past
[12:26] <xnox> ogra_: i don't own thinkpads.... but my housemate does.... i think I know the culprit that stole my charger now.
[12:27] <xnox> thanks a lot =)
[12:27] <ogra_> haha
[12:28] <ogra_> yay, so i have a working implementation of a rotation daemon in shell

[14:56] <sveinse> What is the logic of dpkg triggers? I have a set of packages where each activates the update-initramfs trigger. However I see that update-initramfs is run multiple times. Isn't this what triggers should prevent?
[16:00] <ogra_> janimo, fyi ... i just uploaded http://paste.ubuntu.com/1555763/ as an interim solution
[16:00] <ogra_> (ubuntu-devel mailed as well)
[16:01] <janimo> ogra_, excellent thanks!
[16:01] <ogra_> it is far from perfect, eats quite some CPU
[16:01] <janimo> if it is dash it may not even have such a large mem footprint
[16:02] <janimo> but I did not check except with an empty dash script in a loop
[16:02] <ogra_> "read" is slighly lighter than using $(cat ...) ... whgich spawns a subshell
[16:02] <janimo> meanwhile I am discussing and looking into g-s-d to see if it is feasile to have it there in C
[16:02] <ogra_> but still far from what a simple read from C would do
[16:02] <ogra_> i found it more important to get something out to the user though so this will do for a start
[16:03] <janimo> I agree
[16:03] <ogra_> i guess we need to step on some compiz devs toes though
[16:04] <ogra_> the rotatin is so sloooow
[16:04] <ogra_> *rotating
[16:04] <ogra_> it gets a bit better if i change the sleep to .3 or .5 .... but that costs a lot more CPU
[16:05] <janimo> slow as in noticable latency?
[16:05] <ogra_> slow as in ... as slow as your GO variant
[16:05] <janimo> or the redrawing?
[16:05] <ogra_> yeah
[16:05] <ogra_> i'm pretty sure thats compiz
[16:05] <janimo> but the redrawing is not helped by making more freequent wakeups
[16:05] <janimo> that's why I was not clear what you meant
[16:05] <ogra_> ah, k
[16:06] <ogra_> yeah, changing the sleep value wont fix the redraw slowness
[16:06] <ogra_> but makes it feel more responsive
[16:07] <ogra_> anyway, while it is cool that we can use portrait now, not having input doesnt rellay help :(

[16:19] <janimo> ogra_, completely broken input in unity in all but the default rotation you mean right?
[16:20] <ogra_> right
[16:21] <janimo> ogra_, in lubuntu redraws seem a bit faster
[16:21] <ogra_> heh, for sure
[16:21] <janimo> and input works too
[16:33] <ogra_> i thought so
[16:40] <ogra_> janimo, why did you mark bug 1077062 as fix released ?
[16:40] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1077062 in ubuntu-nexus7 "upower says battery is charged when it is not" [Medium,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1077062
[16:41] <ogra_> i still see massive power manager issues here
[16:41] <ogra_> i frequently get something like "Only 7min of battery life left (100%)"
[16:42] <ogra_> and if it is actually at a low level after a few hours i get the "will suspend soon" message constatly flashing on and off
[16:43] <janimo> ogra_, IIRC the issues I think we see were not the ones actually mentioned in that bug
[16:43] <ogra_> oh, ok
[16:43] <janimo> at least not what the subject says
[16:43] <janimo> I know there are a few power related bugs
[16:43] <janimo> but they need to be separate and specific and I thinkg a few still remain open
[16:44] <ogra_> well, the fun is that i didnt see any such bugs in quantal
[16:45] <ogra_> i wonder if there are kernel config issues
[16:45] <ogra_> two devices for the same thing or some such
[16:46] <ogra_> hmm, upower -d shows me a /sys/devices/platform/tegra-i2c.4/i2c-4/4-0055/power_supply/usb ... as well as an "ac" device
[16:46] <ogra_> i wonder if the usb one was there in quantal
[17:13] <Guest61343> Asking simple questions and getting a simple answer from search engines seems a thing of the past but would anyone know if ubuntu was installed on a raspberry pi would only packages designed for the pi work?
