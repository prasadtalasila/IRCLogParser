[06:26] <MarkDude> Rly?
[20:52] <bkerensa> hi nathwill
[20:52] <nathwill> hi bkerensa :)
[20:52] <nathwill> how's it going?
[20:52] <bkerensa> good
[20:53] <bkerensa> thinking about running out to get some sushi and beer
[20:53] <bkerensa> :D
[20:53] <bkerensa> nathwill: got one of these fitbit things... works with Ubuntu
[20:53] <nathwill> that's cool :)
[20:54] <nathwill> what do you do on the computer with it?
[20:54] <bkerensa> hmm?
[20:54] <bkerensa> it syncs
[20:54] <bkerensa> libfitbit
[20:54] <bkerensa> :D
[20:54] <nathwill> syncs what?
[20:54] <bkerensa> with the interwebz
[20:54] <bkerensa> lol
[20:54] <bkerensa> its a digital pedometer essentially
[20:54] <bkerensa> tracks a bunch of stuff
[20:54] <nathwill> like... how many steps?
[20:54] <bkerensa> yeah and calories and distance
[20:55] <bkerensa> apparently more accurate then GPS
[20:55] <nathwill> do you program it with your stride-length and weight?
[20:56] <bkerensa> yes
[20:57] <nathwill> ah
[20:57] <bkerensa> nathwill: but at the same time it also uses some algorithm based on gender/age/weight/height
[20:57] <bkerensa> to ensure your stride is accurate
[20:57] <nathwill> k, makes sense
[20:58] <nathwill> so... does it sync with their servers through ubuntus network connection, or does it actually do something locally?
[20:58] <bkerensa> there is a Ubuntu FitBit group
[20:58] <bkerensa> it just connects to their servers
[21:00] <nathwill> ok, got it
[21:00] <nathwill> so libfitbit is some kind of udev rules or something?
[21:00] <bkerensa> yes
[21:00] <nathwill> i see a bracelet, a clip and a stick; which are you using?
[21:00] <bkerensa> its a daemon that connects to the USB device... accepts data and transmits it
[21:00] <bkerensa> I bought two Zips
[21:01] <nathwill> ah, so the daemon pulls data off the device and and transmits it
[21:01] <nathwill> gotcha
[21:01] <nathwill> that makes more sense
[21:01] <bkerensa> yeah it just uses a API call
[21:01] <nathwill> wonder if they're using upstart :D
[21:01] <bkerensa> your device ID is associated with your profile
[21:09] <nathwill> well i have to say, the bracelet looks cool
[21:10] <nathwill> i'm a little weirded out about them measuring my pulse all the time; they'd probably have enough data to chart my sex life :/
[21:10] <nathwill> but i can see it being useful
[21:59] <MarkDude> nathwill, link it to status updates on social media sites- it would make for interesting feed....
[22:00] <nathwill> markdude, didn't some best man do that with a pressure-plate under the mattress of the newly-weds hotel?
[22:00] <nathwill> oh yes: http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/12/newlywed-sex-tweets/
[22:02] <MarkDude> lol
[22:02] <MarkDude> TMI
[22:02] <MarkDude> My gf would not dig that
[22:02] <MarkDude> And talk about pressure to perform...
