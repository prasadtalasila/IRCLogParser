[08:37] <snamellit`> oops, sorry rcirc feeding stuff on the prompt.
[08:37] <snamellit`> I just looked at a bug of a crash.
[08:38] <snamellit`> I notified the upstream developer. In what status do I leave the bug now?
[08:44] <jibel> snamellit`, do you have a bug number?

[08:53] <snamellit`> I put it to in progress, but this feels wrong to me...
[08:55] <jibel> snamellit`, indeed, set it to 'in progress' if you're actually working on a fix, otherwise set it to confirmed
[08:56] <jibel> snamellit`, also if you know how to reproduce it, adding the steps in the description would be very useful
[08:56] <snamellit`> so talking to the dev is considered 'working', ok. :-)
[08:57] <snamellit`> trying to reproduce it, not very successfull so far... But executing memory smells bad...

[16:17] <andrewka> Hi i need a bug supervisor to assist sru
[16:17]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[16:17] <TheLordOfTime> good day
[16:18] <TheLordOfTime> andrewka, i heard "SRU" and "Bug" in the same sentence :P
[16:18] <andrewka> good day
[16:18] <TheLordOfTime> i've got 40 minutes before class starts, what's up.
[16:18] <andrewka> I have filed the bug here https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnutls26/+bug/1095052
[16:18] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1095052 in gnutls26 (Ubuntu) "Client certificate authentication fails" [Undecided,New]
[16:19] <andrewka> Its a gnutls issue with client certificate is precise
[16:19] <andrewka> in precise i mean
[16:20] <TheLordOfTime> obvious questions: (1) does this issue exist in Raring? (2) if not, does this issue exist in Quantal? (3) if not, has anyone else been able to confirm the bug other than you?
[16:20] <andrewka> Not in raring and quantal because they use different versions
[16:20] <TheLordOfTime> so then it was "fixed" in quantal or raring, by some higher upstream revision.
[16:21]  * TheLordOfTime glances
[16:21] <andrewka> yes its fixed upstream
[16:21] <andrewka> my patch is actually pulled from upstream
[16:21] <TheLordOfTime> i see that
[16:21] <andrewka> This bug is caused by the same issue - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnutls26/+bug/1020591
[16:21] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1020591 in subversion (Ubuntu) "subversion and GnuTLS internal error" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[16:22] <andrewka> I have the full test case there to reproduce the bug
[16:22] <TheLordOfTime> mind if i ask you why you created a new bug just for the debdiff?
[16:23] <andrewka> because i picked it up in apt-transport-https
[16:23] <TheLordOfTime> ... OH CRAP, I'M GOING TO BE LATE
[16:23]  * TheLordOfTime has to run or he'll be late
[16:23] <andrewka> the existing bug was picked up in subversion
[16:23] <TheLordOfTime> sorry i have to drop you right here though :P
[16:23]  * TheLordOfTime subscribed to both bugs and will check in two hours once class is over.
[16:24] <andrewka> Thanks
[16:24] <TheLordOfTime> unless someone gets to it first
[16:24] <andrewka> i doubt it, i filed that a while ago
[16:25] <TheLordOfTime> there's other bug controllers around other than just me, someone here'll get to it.
[16:25] <andrewka> so i will await your assistence
[16:25] <TheLordOfTime> since you pinged here :P
[16:25] <TheLordOfTime> andrewka, one thing: your patch is missing DEP3 tags.
[16:25] <andrewka> Ok
[16:25] <TheLordOfTime> http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep3/
[16:26] <andrewka> will update
[16:26]  * TheLordOfTime will check the rest later, as he is headed out the door as we speak.
[17:02] <bdmurray> andrewka: Do you happen to know which version of gnutls this was fixed in?
[17:06] <bdmurray> well it looks like 2.12.15 which actually isn't in quantal
[17:06] <bdmurray> so this will need fixing there too
[17:14] <dkessel> balloons, back :)
[18:05] <TheLordOfTime> bdmurray, i can work on the quantal debdiff and add DEP3 tags, which their precise debdiff doesn't include
[18:05]  * TheLordOfTime has two VMs he can destroy after testing
[18:05] <andrewka> it is fixed in 2.12.15
[18:06] <andrewka> was going to update the debdiff and do quantal later tonight if you have vms already then that cool
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> andrewka, i keep VMs for good reasons :P  And I *always* build-test SRUs prior to submitting to the SRU team
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> andrewka, sometimes, you just get FED UP with Windows in a windows environment :P
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> i'm going to assign myself to the quantal part, if you can do the precise, andrewka
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> unless you want me to build both.
[18:08]  * TheLordOfTime glances briefly at oracledb installation progress
[18:08] <andrewka> If its not a bother to you am cool with it
[18:08] <TheLordOfTime> its not
[18:09] <TheLordOfTime> it'll give me a reason to not do anything with php5 for a while :P
[18:09] <andrewka> cool then
[18:09] <TheLordOfTime> so do you want me to rebuild the debdiffs with DEP3 myself for both, or do you just want to tweak your debdiff accordingly and add DEP3?
[18:10]  * TheLordOfTime would buildtest your debdiff regardless
[18:10] <andrewka> go for it, you can rebuild both
[18:10] <TheLordOfTime> OK, bdmurray are yo uable to unsubscribe sponsors?
[18:10] <TheLordOfTime> since sponsors won't have a complete debdiff yet.
[18:11]  * TheLordOfTime doesn't seem to have access.
[18:11] <TheLordOfTime> which may or may not be related to this user account (nonadmin account on a system)
[18:12] <bdmurray> okay, done
[18:13] <TheLordOfTime> bdmurray, thanks much.
[18:13] <TheLordOfTime> bah lag, a message was posted that still referred to Sponsors xD
[18:13] <TheLordOfTime> got processed after you said you unsub'd them.
[18:17] <TheLordOfTime> andrewka, i've assigned the bug to myself for precise and quantal, i'll have debdiffs in a couple of hours
[18:17]  * TheLordOfTime is in a break in class right now
[18:18] <andrewka> TheloadofTime: Thanks
[18:22] <TheLordOfTime> good news: if i remove the diff on the NEWS item, it imports right :P
[18:22] <TheLordOfTime> (the upstream diff)
[18:23] <andrewka> :^)
[18:24]  * TheLordOfTime disappearifies temporarily
[18:50] <TheLordOfTime> and i'm back.
[18:57] <TheLordOfTime> andrewka, update: i've made build-tests and uploaded them to one of my PPAs, i believe i put it in my build tests ppa, unless i mistyped the path.  in the interim i'm creating a debdiff that would be SRUable.
[18:57] <TheLordOfTime> fast progress is fast :P
[18:58] <TheLordOfTime> oops
[18:59] <TheLordOfTime> ehehehe, i accidentally targetted precise-proposed with my build test xD
[19:10] <TheLordOfTime> andrewka, once they build-test (assuming a successful build) i will attach debdiffs to the bug.
[19:10] <TheLordOfTime> bdmurray, ^
[19:10] <TheLordOfTime> (just for your ref, bdmurray)
[19:10] <TheLordOfTime> i apparently have to find my laptop charger, so... i'm out again and will return later

[22:39] <TheLordOfTime> lemonsqueeze, the linux kernel bugs are usually seen pretty quickly by who needs to see them, once you attach logs and stuff, that can be used to then figure out the issue, but you do have to wait for Linux people to see it (to answer your question: you file the bug, attach, the details, and wait)
[22:41] <lemonsqueeze> will do, thanks =)
