[00:06] <StevenK> agrestringere: Hidden, thanks for reporting.
[00:09] <TheLordOfTime> evillyEvil, i'm going to sit back, there's more pro people than I here.
[00:09]  * TheLordOfTime has to fix a broken sbuild on one of his local build boxes anyways

[04:04] <george_e> I've just built a package for Precise in a PPA... but it won't let me build the package for Quantal:
[04:04] <george_e> https://code.launchpad.net/~george-edison55/+archive/nitroshare-dev/+packages
[04:04] <george_e> "Copying failed of qtbase-opensource-src (5.0.0~rc2-0ubuntu1~test2)"
[04:04] <TheLordOfTime> george_e, qtbase-opensource-src 5.0.0~rc2-0ubuntu1~test2 in quantal (same version already has published binaries in the destination archive)
[04:04] <TheLordOfTime> george_e, to make that work, you need to differentiate them between releases
[04:05] <TheLordOfTime> like my ZNC PPA does: https://launchpad.net/~teward/+archive/znc-1.0/+packages
[04:05] <TheLordOfTime> same package, just... modified.
[04:05] <george_e> How do I do that if I'm simply copying from one PPA to another?
[04:05] <TheLordOfTime> george_e, dget the source and republish to your PPA with new changelog entries?
[04:05] <TheLordOfTime> its how ZNC 1.0-2 from Debian got into my PPA for ZNC 1.0 for all 3 releases (Precise, Quantal, Raring)
[04:06] <george_e> That's not the way it's _supposed_ to work :P
[04:06] <TheLordOfTime> "supposed" to work assumes there's multiple repositories (apt0
[04:06] <TheLordOfTime> ever notice precise, precise-updates, quantal, raring, etc. are all separate repositories on the same mirrors? :P
[04:06] <george_e> You're right - I'm going to have to dput the source it seems.
[04:07] <StevenK> george_e: You can't copy source and binaries one at a time into multiple series
[04:07]  * george_e wishes things were easier.
[04:07] <george_e> StevenK: What's the proper way to go about this?
[04:07] <TheLordOfTime> StevenK, you can't publish the same version in the same PPA for multiple releases, either.
[04:07] <TheLordOfTime> limitation of PPAs.
[04:07] <george_e> :|
[04:07] <StevenK> If you can easily put the code into bzr, use a recipe
[04:08] <TheLordOfTime> that *would* work
[04:08] <george_e> StevenK: Well... that's a possibility.
[04:08] <TheLordOfTime> but if you're doing it manually, i think you're going to hit this limitation
[04:08] <george_e> But it will end up being a lot more work than I initially had hoped.
[04:08] <george_e> Yeah, a recipe seems the way to go.
[04:09] <wgrant> TheLordOfTime: Um
[04:09] <TheLordOfTime> wgrant, did they change the system?
[04:09] <wgrant> TheLordOfTime: You *can* publish the same version in the same PPA
[04:09] <wgrant> Always have been able to
[04:09] <TheLordOfTime> wgrant, by hand?
[04:09] <TheLordOfTime> since when?
[04:09] <wgrant> You just have to copy the binaries too
[04:09] <wgrant> You can't rebuild
[04:09] <TheLordOfTime> ah...
[04:09] <wgrant> Since Launchpad started managing packages in February 2006
[04:09] <TheLordOfTime> wgrant, see, nobody explained that to me.
[04:09] <george_e> Won't that be a problem with libc6 and other core system libraries that a binary links to?
[04:10] <wgrant> You need to manually confirm that the binaries will work when copied, of course
[04:10] <TheLordOfTime> wgrant, although, generally, you'd want to rebuild packages with the libraries in $release no?
[04:10] <wgrant> george_e: Not usually if you copy *up*
[04:10] <george_e> Right... good point.
[04:10] <wgrant> Copying binaries down is often a problem, and copying up won't always work due to soname changes and stuff like that
[04:10] <george_e> I think I'll just get the package building in a recipe.
[04:10] <wgrant> But it's often possible to copy up
[04:11] <TheLordOfTime> wgrant, typically i would rather rebuild each package for each release, because usually what i'm putting in a PPA needs to work with all libraries for the given releases (Case in point ZNC)
[04:11] <TheLordOfTime> (also case in point: nginx)
[04:12] <wgrant> Sure, sometimes you need to
[04:12] <TheLordOfTime> and another case in point: php5
[04:12] <TheLordOfTime> (don't ask :/)
[07:40] <YoBoY> hi
[07:57] <YoBoY> just a question for now : 2 years ago we asked to have a meta-project to have all our web projects reunited, the name is ubuntu-fr-website-project. This year we want to extend our activities and have also desktop projects (tools, ubuntu lenses/scopes, server scriptsâ€¦). To reflect that change, is this possible to change a meta-project ID or have we to ask for a new meta-project and attach everything to it or perhaps another solution ?
[08:06] <wgrant> YoBoY: We can rename it
[08:08] <YoBoY> wgrant, can this make some side effects I have to take care before ?
[08:09] <wgrant> YoBoY: Nothing really, and we can add a redirect from the old name if you want
[08:09] <YoBoY> ho cool :)
[08:09] <wgrant> Ask at https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+addquestion so we can keep track of it and verify your identity
[08:10] <YoBoY> yes sure :) it was just a question for now ;)
[08:10] <wgrant> Sure
[08:10] <YoBoY> to know what it is possible to do :p
[08:10] <wgrant> :)
[08:11] <YoBoY> another one : one of our members created a project with a "wrong" name, to delete it, I just have to ask to the deletion ?
[08:11] <wgrant> Sure, same place
[08:11] <wgrant> Or ask for it to be renamed, also at the same place :)
[08:12] <YoBoY> well, he already created a new one with another name. I just want to clean all this :p
[08:12] <wgrant> Ahh
[08:13] <YoBoY> it was done in the rush
[08:19] <YoBoY> 2013, new year, new projects, new teams organisation perhaps :)
[08:19] <YoBoY> btw, happy new year everyone :)
[10:46] <Gwaihir> hello all, have a question about Ubuntu SSO: does it work with Launchpad private team?
[10:47] <czajkowski> Gwaihir: what do you mean ?
[10:47] <czajkowski> SSO is different from LP
[10:48] <czajkowski> but if you log into LP with SSO to a private team you should have no issues
[10:49] <Gwaihir> hmmm... kind of different: use case is I'm part of a private team in Launchpad, I use Ubuntu SSO to log in into another website than LP, but I do not see the private team listed as part of the login, and I cannot access what I should access as part of the team
[10:49] <Gwaihir> just wondering if it is an error on our side, or something else
[10:50] <czajkowski> Gwaihir: so SSO issues you need to poke folks in #canonical-isd
[10:50] <Gwaihir> czajkowski, ack
[10:50] <Gwaihir> thanks!
[10:51] <czajkowski> Gwaihir: it may be quiet at this hour of the day, https://forms.canonical.com/sso-support/  might also be an idea if you dont get an answer
[10:52] <Gwaihir> czajkowski, that is a good link, thanks!
[10:57] <czajkowski> np
[10:57] <czajkowski> Gwaihir: coming to fosdem ?
[10:58] <Gwaihir> czajkowski, not yet decided... but I do not think, I have to check the schedule and see if there is something interesting also work-related
[10:58] <czajkowski> Gwaihir: can you let folks know in the italian loco https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fosdem/2013
[10:59] <Gwaihir> czajkowski, sure! will forward the link
[10:59] <czajkowski> thanks
[12:11] <oly> hi, wonder if someone could help me out i have a package on launchpad which is not building correctly, https://code.launchpad.net/~oly/+recipe/rhythmboxwebremote-daily-12.10 it does not seem to merge the changes guessing its something todo with my package files ?
[12:12] <czajkowski> wgrant: how do I diagnoise these?
[12:12] <oly> i did have it setup and working but i changed the way it was layout, i had a debian folder in the trunk so i moved it to two seperate branches but since doing this the resulting packages are not complete :/
[12:14] <wgrant> oly: It built properly, but it failed to upload because the version is the same as one that built previously.
[12:14] <wgrant> Possibly because you only include the trunk revno, and not the packaging revno, so a change in just the packaging branch will cause a version conflict
[12:15] <oly> oh, i saw a failure i thought that was a previous attempt not the current one, i will bump the revision in the changelog and see if that fixes it
[12:16] <wgrant> oly: You can add {revno:packaging} to the version template to include the other branch's revno
[12:16] <wgrant> So a change to either branch will increment the version
[12:20] <oly> okay, i have made those changes, not sure if this is the original issue i had but i can hope, queued the build again so fingers crossed :)

[22:17] <paultag> Hey, any PPA folks around? Got a technical question about the backing impl
[22:17] <paultag> I'm wondering exactly to what "~foo/bar" expands to on your dput sftp rule
[22:17] <paultag> since it's not scp, there's no environ or anything, so ~foo isn't easy to work out
[22:18] <wgrant> What do you mean?
[22:18] <StevenK> It doesn't expand
[22:18] <wgrant> It's literal
[22:18] <paultag> StevenK: it's a literal "~foo" ?
[22:18] <wgrant> It's not a real filesystem
[22:18] <paultag> Oh hot damn, great.
[22:19] <paultag> awesome, thanks folks.
