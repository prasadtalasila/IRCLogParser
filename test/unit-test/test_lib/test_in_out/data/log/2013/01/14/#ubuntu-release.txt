[07:45] <infinity> cjwatson: Oh, to be clear on the d-i versus omap4 kernels thing, the ABI referenced in that upload *does* exist in -proposed, but it's currently buggy, so waiting on today's PPA upload to land would be good before we accept it (but please do review).

[14:23] <Daviey> ugh, we don't get a useful c-m anymore due to using -proposed?
[14:29] <tseliot> cjwatson: can you promote these sources from NEW and move them to main (in raring), please? nvidia-settings-304 nvidia-settings-304-updates nvidia-settings-310 nvidia-settings-310-updates
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[14:35] <cjwatson> Daviey: It's on Ursinha's to-do list
[14:35] <Ursinha> hello Daviey :) yes, it is
[14:35] <cjwatson> tseliot: Looking
[14:38] <cjwatson> tseliot: What's going to deal with installing all these differently-versioned tools packages?
[14:39] <tseliot> cjwatson: there are packages which recommend them: e.g. nvidia-310 recommends nvidia-settings-310
[14:39] <cjwatson> What's going to deal with installing those? :-)
[14:40] <cjwatson> I guess I don't care that much; it just seems like a step backwards to have to have multiple different versions of userspace tools, rather than a single master thing that can configure any of the possibilities
[14:41] <tseliot> cjwatson: the main problem is that drivers can break the interface nvidia-settings deals with
[14:41] <cjwatson> Ah.  Sucky
[14:41] <cjwatson> Well, not my problem I guess
[14:41] <tseliot> :)
[14:41] <cjwatson> Accepted - they'll probably fall back into multiverse or something after moving out of -proposed and have to be fixed up due to that known bug, so remind me if I forget
[14:42] <tseliot> cjwatson: ok, I will, thanks
[14:43] <Daviey> Ursinha: Great :)
[15:54] <cjwatson> Hmm.  Looking at oversizedness.  Would it make sense to switch ubuntu-desktop in precise-proposed to Recommends: linux-headers-generic-lts-quantal rather than linux-headers-generic [amd64], linux-headers-generic-pae [i386]?
[15:55] <cjwatson> It would have the effect of installing linux-headers-generic-lts-quantal for upgraders, but would (I think) drop linux-headers-generic{,-pae} and dependencies off images.
[15:56] <tseliot> cjwatson: can you please reject the following sources from precise-proposed (I need to commit one more change)?: fglrx-installer-experimental-9 (2:9.010-0ubuntu0.3 and 2:9.010-0ubuntu0.4), fglrx-installer-updates (2:9.000-0ubuntu0.3 and 2:9.000-0ubuntu0.4), nvidia-graphics-drivers-experimental-310 (310.14-0ubuntu0.3)
[16:00] <cjwatson> tseliot: Done
[16:00] <tseliot> cjwatson: thanks again
[16:11] <cjwatson> doko: Is that ready yet?  Neil's latest blog post suggested that he was part-way through a refactor that would make it all a lot saner
[16:12] <doko> well, I was hoping to use it for the cross build just for perl for now
[16:12] <doko> but I can use a local copy too
[16:12] <cjwatson> It just seems to me that we could easily end up doing chunks of work several times.
[16:13] <cjwatson> But whatever ...
[16:13] <doko> so feel free to reject it
[16:14] <doko> however he seems to build his own arm64 toolchain first
[16:16] <cjwatson> meh, you can have it, I'm not that worried :)
[16:21] <cjwatson> Hmm, not clear that the new livecd-rootfs is doing a stellar job of resolving things properly
[16:21] <cjwatson> cmap-adobe-japan1 shouldn't be here
[16:24] <cjwatson> Hmm, I think that Recommends: cmap-adobe-japan2 is insufficient to resolve an alternative Depends
[16:24] <cjwatson> When using only metapackages, anyway
=== henrix is now known as henrix_
=== henrix_ is now known as henrix
[16:30] <cjwatson> And I'm not sure it's possible to get rid of notification-daemon again without SRUing some other things to add notify-osd as a preferred alternative
[16:31] <cjwatson> Tasks definitely have their advantages
[17:04] <infinity> cjwatson: In raring, I dropped linux-headers recommends entirely from the desktop metapackage, since they're pulled in by installing linux-$(flavour) anyway.
[17:04] <infinity> cjwatson: Not sure if you feel we can get away with that in precise, but if the installer DTRT, I don't see why not.
[17:07] <ogra_> is that true for arm as well ?
[17:07] <infinity> ogra_: Yes.  It fixed the silly situation where the nexus7 images had omap4 headers. :P
[17:08] <ogra_> yeah
[17:08] <ogra_> well, not only nexus7 ... the omap4 ones were seeded in -desktop iirc
[17:08] <infinity> Exactly.
[17:08] <infinity> That was just an example.  ac100 had the same problem.
[17:08] <ogra_> yup
=== tyhicks` is now known as tyhicks
[17:42] <ogra_> oh, even on chromebook !
[17:42] <ogra_> update-manager just removed the omap4 headers with this upgrade
=== henrix is now known as henrix_
=== henrix_ is now known as henrix
[18:32] <cjwatson> Moving cmap-adobe-japan2 to ubuntu-desktop's Depends causes cmap-adobe-japan1 not to be installed.  OTOH moving libqt4-sql-sqlite similarly makes no difference to libqt4-sql-mysql.
[18:32] <cjwatson> Sigh.
[19:09] <infinity> cjwatson: I'm working with apw right now to fix the linux-generic deps.  Do we really need to switch the -desktop recommends, rather than just dropping it?
[19:09] <infinity> cjwatson: (It'll bring in the wrong headers on upgrade for people still using the 3.2.0 kernel, will it not?)
[19:15] <apw> infinity, ack, am going to do the 4 you mentioned for me
[19:15] <infinity> apw: My hero. :)
[19:16] <infinity> ARGH, WHY DHCLIENT, WHY?!
[19:17]  * infinity changes his IP on his PPC machine to static, so dhclient stops complaining about it being 1930.
[19:18] <infinity> Oh, or maybe I can use the fixrtc hack.
[19:22] <infinity> # It will probably fail, but we won't have made the situation any worse.
[19:22] <infinity> ^-- Best comment I've read all week.
