[05:34] <pitti> Good morning
[05:39] <balloons> pitti, man, you have an early timezone :-)
[05:40] <balloons> gout nacht
[05:42] <pitti> balloons: sleep well!
[07:20] <jibel> good morning
[07:23] <pitti> bonjour jibel, ça va?
[07:24] <jibel> bonjour pitti. ça va bien et toi ? I wish it will be a surprise-less day unlike yesterday :)
[07:24] <pitti> jibel: heh, without jenkins crumbling underneath you, you mean?
[07:25] <jibel> pitti, yes
[07:33] <jibel> pitti, I forwarded you a feature request from jodh. He'd like to run tests in a container, inside the testbed
[07:33] <jibel> this is for the case where a test can potentially kill itself
[07:35] <pitti> thanks, I'll have a look

[12:42] <apw> gema, yo ... we have boot speed testing going on on an ongoing basis right ... where is that so i can see when a regression was introduced
[12:43] <gema> apw: it is not completely populated yet
[12:43] <apw> ?
[12:43] <apw> i thought you guys took that over like a year ago
[12:44] <gema> we did and then we realised that the data we were producing was completely irrelevant with variation of up to 50% between runs
[12:44] <gema> so we are refurbishing it
[12:44] <gema> and some bug in the desktop hit us, but let me see how much data we have in staging, just a sec
[12:45] <gema> apw: I was planning to have this up and running before the new year, but we got delayed
[14:23] <rbasak> Battling with adt-run today, and the manpage makes little sense to me
[14:23] <rbasak> How do I get adt-run to test using the tests in an unbuilt local tree, but using a package from the repository?
[14:24] <rbasak> I feel that somebody could really do with going through all the documentation for the "developing dep8 tests for the first time" use case.
[14:31] <rbasak> "SKIP Test breaks testbed but testbed does not advertise revert-full-system" - well OK, but I need to override that. I know that'll break the system.
