[04:45] <gnomefreak> anyone around
[04:46] <micahg> sure
[04:47] <gnomefreak> i keep getting an email ab out lightning locales, i will pastebin it for you.

[04:50] <micahg> hrm, it should just be shipped in the lightning source or thunderbird with 20
[04:50] <micahg> err...lightning-extension
[04:51] <micahg> but I'm not doing much with this stuff these days, I'm still wondering why they're not shipping since I thought that upstream provides the locales, but that might require tweaking the source generation script
[04:52] <gnomefreak> i try/tried to stay away from locales when possible
[04:53] <gnomefreak> did Mozilla rethink including lightning into tbird again?
[04:54] <micahg> no, but it comes from the same archive, so we're going to build them from the "thunderbird" source
[04:54] <gnomefreak> k
[04:54] <micahg> that change probably won't hit stable releases until thunderbird 24
[04:55] <gnomefreak> i was really looking forward to the merging but was dissapointed that it fell through
[12:04] <bolvary> Hi there, When I open Contacts no addressbook appears in Thunderbird. However, if I open TB first then I can access my contacts. Is there a way to fix this annoying issue?
