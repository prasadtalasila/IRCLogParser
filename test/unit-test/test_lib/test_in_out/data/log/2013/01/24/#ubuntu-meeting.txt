[20:11] <notgary> #topic Review of previous meeting minutes
=== meetingology changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: Ubuntu Meeting Grounds | Calendar/Scheduled meetings: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/calendar | Logs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs | Meetingology documentation: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology | Meeting of the One Hundred Paper Cuts team for 13-01-24 Meeting | Current topic:  Review of previous meeting minutes
[20:11] <notgary> Last time we decided to focus the project on the foundation UI technologies in Ubuntu
[20:12] <notgary> So GTK+ and Compiz will be our primary targets
[20:12] <notgary> the idea being to work on the apps that use them, and try and fix the bugs in the foundation so other apps can benefit
[20:13] <notgary> William Hua (attenuate) from the desktop team kindly volunteered to help us work on GTK issues
[20:13] <notgary> We also decided to create and maintain our own PPA
[20:13] <notgary> where we would keep scripts and tools that will helps us get our job done a lot easier
[20:14] <notgary> We decided that, in order to get design input on paper cuts, we should assign them to jnick_tait, a project manager on the design team, who would delegate them to another designer
[20:14] <notgary> and last of all
[20:15] <notgary> we decided that it would be better to use #ubuntu-desktop as out main irc channel
[20:15] <notgary> instead of our own
[20:15] <notgary> so we were not isolated from the rest of the community in our own little corner
[20:15] <notgary> that's the minutes from the previous meeting
[20:15] <notgary> Is everyone happy that that's how things went down last time?
[20:16] <notgary> Heh
[20:17] <notgary> Guess no-ones here from last time :)

=== ayan_ is now known as ayan
[20:21] <notgary> This coming tuesday
[20:21] <notgary> I'll be giving a developer week session on the paper cuts project on Ubuntu on air
[20:22] <notgary> I'll be doing the speaking on the stream and questions will be taken in #ubuntu-classroom-chat
[20:22] <notgary> I've got a list of talking points here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneHundredPaperCuts/Events/DeveloperWeek2013
[20:22] <notgary> And my plan was to talk around them
[20:23] <notgary> The list is not complete, and will still be in flux probably right up until the last minute
[20:23] <notgary> But does anyone have anything they think should be covered that isn't there?
[20:23] <DiegoTc> Give me some minutes to check it out
[20:23] <notgary> Cool
[20:24] <DiegoTc> I suppose this Fixing paper cuts
[20:24] <notgary> What about it?
[20:26] <notgary> DiegoTc: What about fixing paper cuts?
[20:27] <notgary> Is guess DiegoTc 's AFK just now. Anyone else got a thought about the current plans for developer week?
[20:28] <DiegoTC> Hi
[20:28] <notgary> Hey :)
[20:28] <DiegoTC> sorry laptop when of
[20:28] <notgary> No worries
[20:29] <notgary> What are your thoughts on the current developer week plans?
[20:29] <DiegoTC> So I suppose that in this part Fixing paper cuts
[20:29] <DiegoTC> you wil talk about how to fix bugs?
[20:29] <DiegoTC> that have been assign or no?
[20:30] <notgary> The process you need to go through to get a bug fixed in Ubuntu, including getting patches merged upstream. the process of fixing a paper cut is very similar to the process of fixing a normal bug in Ubuntu, so most it will be covering those processes again
[20:30] <notgary> I won't go into the details of specific apps
[20:31] <notgary> Or of specific bugs
[20:31] <notgary> That's all
[20:31] <DiegoTC> well long time ago i haven't read the documentation of fixing bugs
[20:31] <notgary> It's changed quite a bit over the past few years
[20:31] <DiegoTC> But last time I sow there is missing something important
[20:32] <DiegoTC> How to configure your working enviroment
[20:32] <notgary> Hmm
[20:32] <DiegoTC> you know the code is in launchpad
[20:32] <DiegoTC> but okay whats next
[20:32] <notgary> That is a good point
[20:32] <DiegoTC> documentation wasn't clear for that
[20:32] <DiegoTC> so lets say
[20:32] <DiegoTC> I want to fix the title of compiz
[20:33] <DiegoTC> okay, but what I need to work on compiz code?
[20:33] <DiegoTC> I have the code
[20:33] <DiegoTC> how do i configure it
[20:33] <DiegoTC> is something special
[20:33] <DiegoTC> is there any specific IDE
[20:33] <DiegoTC> or gedit is good for that
[20:34] <DiegoTC> that's my opinion
[20:34] <notgary> It's a pretty good one though
[20:35] <notgary> Over the past couple of months we've been setting up an area on the wiki that we call our Dojo - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OneHundredPaperCuts/PaperCutsNinja/Dojo/GTK3
[20:35] <notgary> It's going to cover tips and ticks to working with the different apps and packages that we're going to be working on
[20:36] <notgary> In the run up to the session, we could make sure there's a bit there for configuring your development environment
[20:36] <notgary> Since most of the apps we'll touch will be based on GTK, there should be a lot of steps in common between each one
[20:36] <notgary> Perhaps a weekend project :P
[20:36] <notgary> What do you think?
[20:37] <DiegoTC> yeap
[20:37] <DiegoTC> that sounds a good idea
[20:38] <notgary> #vote Write a guide to configuring a development environment for working with paper cuts

[20:39] <notgary> #topic Getting more people involved
=== meetingology changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: Ubuntu Meeting Grounds | Calendar/Scheduled meetings: http://fridge.ubuntu.com/calendar | Logs: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs | Meetingology documentation: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/meetingology | Meeting of the One Hundred Paper Cuts team for 13-01-24 Meeting | Current topic:  Getting more people involved
[20:40] <notgary> Getting more people involved in the project is critical to it's long term survival
[20:40] <notgary> DiegoTc: As a new contributor, how did you end up getting involved?
[20:41] <DiegoTC> notgary: you mean how did I discover papercut
[20:41] <DiegoTC> or how I plan to get involved?
[20:42] <notgary> How did you discover it and what was it that made you want to get involved. If we can identify the things that are attracting people right now then we can do more of that in the future.
[20:43] <DiegoTC> Ahh
[20:43] <DiegoTC> I read your article
[20:43] <DiegoTC> in planet.ubuntu
[20:43] <notgary> Which one? I've been shamelessly spamming Planet with paper cut article :)
[20:43] <DiegoTC> the first one
[20:43] <DiegoTC> helping in ubuntu and no one notice it
[20:44] <DiegoTC> that all cool people are in unity
[20:44] <notgary> This one? http://www.notgary.com/2013/01/want-to-get-involved-with-ubuntu-get.html
[20:44] <DiegoTC> yes
[20:45] <notgary> That one seems to be the most popular, and I did write it differently to the rest
[20:45] <DiegoTC> Actually I have always want to start helping fixing bugs, but lets said time, work, college, and each time I download the code and didn't find no place to go to configure I just left it that way
[20:46] <notgary> You're just the person I've been aiming these at
[20:46] <notgary> People who want to help out
[20:46] <notgary> But don't get round to it
[20:46] <notgary> I figure that if I keep reminding people that we're here
[20:46] <notgary> They'll eventually come and check us out.
[20:47] <notgary> I think we need to set up our own little internal project for getting more people involved
[20:47] <notgary> It's a pretty big task (persuading people to come along0
[20:48] <notgary> and it'll involved more time and effort than we can put in with the 15 minutes we have left in this meeting
[20:48] <notgary> So what don't we decide here that we need a real plan for attracting new contributors
[20:49] <notgary> and discuss it outside of the meeting, on the mailing list and in #ubuntu-desktop
[20:49] <notgary> How does that sound?
[20:50] <DiegoTC> that sounds great

[20:51] <notgary> After this meeeting
[20:52] <notgary> I think we should start having regular meetings once a week
[20:52] <notgary> I think there's been such a low turnout this time because we're not having regular meetings
[20:52] <notgary> so they're not fresh in people's minds
[20:52] <DiegoTC> well I am not friend or regular meeting
[20:52] <notgary> and they haven't gotten into a routine of attending them
[20:52] <DiegoTC> its 14:53 right now
[20:52] <notgary> Why not?
[20:53] <DiegoTC> I am on work :p shouldn't be here
[20:53] <notgary> Ah
[20:53] <notgary> We also have a regular contributor who fixes a lot of bugs in GTK apps who live in Australia
[20:53] <notgary> and so cannot attend any meeting
[20:54] <DiegoTC> Meeting probably on Saturday?
[20:54] <notgary> They would be held at 1900 UTC (an hour before this one started tonight)
[20:54] <notgary> If people are up for a weekend meeting, then that would be fine
[20:55] <notgary> I figured that contributors will be scattered around the world in many different timezones, so no matter what time we chose, someone would be unhappy
[20:55] <notgary> What we can vote on then (since we're running out of time and you have to get back to work)
[20:55] <notgary> is to speak with the rest of the contributors and find out what sort of time they would like
[20:56] <notgary> #vote Decide on a regular meeting time

[20:57] <notgary> So there are two items left on the agenda that we won't cover tonight
[20:57] <notgary> The first, item 2, was added by someone who isn't here to discuss it, so I'll move it to the next meeting's agenda for him
[20:58] <notgary> and the second is more of me just pontificating about what sort of future I see for the project
[20:58] <notgary> which I can do in a blog post
[20:58] <notgary> :)
[20:58] <notgary> So unless you have anything else to add
[20:58] <notgary> I think we can conclude this meeting
[20:58] <DiegoTC> yeap
[20:58] <notgary> Cool
[20:58] <DiegoTC> thats fine for me
