[06:52] <duanedesign> mysteriousdaren: i like updting wiki pwr
[06:53] <duanedesign> s.pwr/pages
[06:53] <mysteriousdaren> duanedesign: yes. I usually help users more than update the wiki getting back into ubuntu forums
[06:55] <duanedesign> when I am not trying to develop new apps, which is time consuming
[06:56] <mysteriousdaren> duanedesign: yes, true. What are you working atm?
[06:56] <duanedesign> mysteriousdaren: of awesome, helping new users is a great way to contribute
[06:57] <duanedesign> mysteriousdaren: are you running UBuntu or a #buntu variant?
[06:58] <mysteriousdaren> Lubuntu 12.10, Ubuntu Server 12.04, and Ubuntu 12.10.
[06:59] <duanedesign> mysteriousdaren:  this is my recent project, turning out to be popular, i was kinda suprised
[06:59] <duanedesign> https://launchpad.net/clicompanion
[06:59] <duanedesign> if you have time could try the deb on ubuntu 12.10
[07:00] <duanedesign> we dont have a ppa yet for 12.10
[07:01] <duanedesign> the app installs very litle if you decide you do not want to use it
[07:02] <duanedesign> it is a commmand line, like gnome-trminal, but has the ability to store commands yo
[07:02] <duanedesign> I got tired of hsving a hugr word doc with al the commands I come acroxx
[07:03] <duanedesign> s.acroxx/across
[07:03] <mysteriousdaren> duanedesign: it looks interesting,  I might have use for it
[07:05] <duanedesign> we recentlt addded a keyboard shortcut to hide all the 'command dictionary' stuff so it ast just like gnome-terminal when you are not adding or using your stored commwnf lidt
[07:05] <duanedesign> lidt*
[07:06] <mysteriousdaren> duane: are you alone in this?
[07:06] <duanedesign> ugh, dark here, maybe I should turn on some ights, my typing id poor
[07:07] <mysteriousdaren> true, I have light from my screen to help me.
[07:07] <duanedesign> mysteriousdaren: I did a large portion of it mysef. I have others hlp on some critical stuff
[07:07] <mysteriousdaren>  nvm i just read the contributors

[07:10] <duanedesign> https://launchpad.net/clicompanion/1.0/1.1/+download/clicompanion_1.1-6__bzr109_all.deb
[07:11] <mysteriousdaren> I should add it to stumbleupon
[07:11] <duanedesign> that should be the latest deb without using the ppa. i am working on a 12.10 PPA
[07:12] <duanedesign> mysteriousdaren: that would begreat
[07:13] <mysteriousdaren> duanedesign: programming should suffice? or computer science? linux?
[07:14] <mysteriousdaren> duanedesign: someone already did, I just liked it
[07:15] <duanedesign> h,, linux, ubuntu
[07:16] <duanedesign> mysteriousdaren: well thanks for the thought
