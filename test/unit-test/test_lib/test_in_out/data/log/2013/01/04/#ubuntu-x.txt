[01:21] <bryce> mlankhorst, happy NY to you as well
[01:43] <GeoffCh> Happy New Era too!  bryce, supposing you got my email:  do you suppose the i915 driver could be mapping my modelines somehow to fit within the (wrong) dimensions of my display?
[01:44] <bryce> GeoffCh, dunno, I'd have to see logs
[01:47] <GeoffCh> OK, I can do that.  Xorg.0.log, syslog, xorg.conf, anything else?
[01:47] <bryce> xrandr --verbose, dmesg
[01:48] <GeoffCh> OK, sure.  No hurry, I'll email them.

[14:43] <ricotz> bjsnider, hi
[14:43] <bjsnider> hi
[14:43] <ricotz> bjsnider, by any chance did you look into building nvidia blob with 3.8rc2 yet?
[14:44] <bjsnider> no
[14:44] <ricotz> ok, thanks
[15:54] <mlankhorst> sforshee: do you know of other ati cards that might also need the d3 delay increase?
[15:56] <sforshee> mlankhorst, I only have one other system with an ATI card and it doesn't have hybrid graphics. I haven't seen any issues with that one.
[15:57] <sforshee> slangasek has a mac mini with radeon, but when I had that one I don't recall seeing any issues either
[15:57] <mlankhorst> ok so it might be just this laptop then having problems during switcheroo?
[15:57] <sforshee> perhaps
[20:31] <ricotz> Sarvatt, hey ;), i see you having fun updating things
[20:35] <Sarvatt> yeah would have helped if i looked before test building/uploading xserver :)
[20:40] <ricotz> oh :)
[20:40] <ricotz> did you dare to think about 1.13.99.901 ;)
[20:45] <ricotz> i hope someone likes to pick up pixman 0.28.2
[21:06] <Sarvatt> ricotz: have you tried newer pixman? the glyph cache stuff is supposed to make the nvidia blow up last i looked
[21:06] <Sarvatt> from 0.27
[21:06] <Sarvatt> err nvidia blob blow up
[21:06] <ricotz> no, havent tried it
[21:07] <ricotz> xserver 1.14rc1 will need it though
[21:07] <Sarvatt> saw lots of complaints from arch people on the nvidia forums about it
[21:07] <ricotz> hmm, i see
[21:09] <Sarvatt> ahh arch backported the commit from xserver master to 1.13, so our 1.13 will be fine
[21:09] <Sarvatt> but yeah https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/32612
[21:19]  * bryce waves
[21:37] <wrouesnel> is there any word on if the radeon drivers are working in the edgers ppa again?
[21:39] <mlankhorst> was a bit of fallout in linux git lately :P
[21:40] <wrouesnel> ?
[21:53] <mlankhorst> Sarvatt: hm does edgers use kernel drm git version?
[21:54] <agrestringere> Got a quick question for you all: I updated to the Xorg Edgers PPA and the current 3.5 Kernel is having massive problems with my Wifi
[21:54] <agrestringere> the broadcom sta driver won't even start up
[21:55] <agrestringere> any advice on how to get this working?
[21:59] <agrestringere>  Anyone can help with this:  Linux 3.5.0-18-generic #29-Ubuntu , wireless package used is bcmwl-kernel-source_5.100.82.112+bdcom-0ubuntu3_amd64.deb
[22:02] <agrestringere> handling it in #ubuntu room, ignore, thanks...
