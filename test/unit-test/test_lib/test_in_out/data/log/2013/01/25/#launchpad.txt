[09:03] <oly> hi, i have made a change to a project on lacunchpad and would like to know the process to commit it back is there any information on this any where ?
[09:04] <oly> normally i just commit to my own projects, so making changes to others code bases is new to me,
[09:05] <czajkowski> so you want to ush it back to launhc ad
[09:05] <czajkowski> *launchpad
[09:06] <oly> yes,
[09:06] <oly> its a change to one of the ubuntu web apps so i guess it needs reviewing or something
[09:07] <czajkowski> ah thats ubunut and not launhcpad you'll need to ask in #ubuntu-webapps
[09:07] <czajkowski> *ubuntu
[09:07] <oly> its a nice simple change, so i thought it would be a good test to learn the process
[09:07] <oly> but the code is on launchpad ? so dont i push it there
[09:07] <czajkowski> you do
[09:07] <oly> or is each project different ?
[09:07] <czajkowski> but you need to ask what the review process is
[09:07] <oly> oh i see, cheers i will go ask :)
[09:08] <czajkowski> http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/bzr-0.10/bzr_man.htm  might also heklp
[09:08] <czajkowski> *help
[09:10] <mgz> you might want to link a newer version of the docs, though
[09:10] <oly> okay cheers, i am familiar with branching and merging though,
[09:10] <mgz> google likes indexing the really old ones first, for whatever reason
[09:10] <czajkowski> mgz: sorry was the top hit when I searched :)
[09:10] <czajkowski> mgz: morning btw
[09:10] <mgz> mornin' :)
[09:10] <oly> its more the where do i push my code to and do i create a merge request like you do in git
[09:11] <czajkowski> oly: like I say talk to the team they will point you in the right direction there
[09:11] <mgz> oly: see https://help.launchpad.net/Code
[09:11] <mgz> and related subpages
[09:12] <oly> okay, i submitted my question to the room, thanks for the help czajkowski and mgz :)
[09:13] <oly> cheers mgz think that link outlined kind of what i was after :)

[10:57] <czajkowski> mgz: can you be like all the other users and just put it on answers
[10:57] <czajkowski> please
[10:57] <czajkowski> :)
[10:57] <czajkowski> not that I dont appreciate it
[10:57] <czajkowski> just trying to not fire the router here off a wall and stomp on it
[10:58] <mgz> czajkowski: ^mpt :)
[10:58] <czajkowski> mpt:
[10:58]  * czajkowski looks a tthe shinny cisco router and tempted to play frisbee with it 
[11:22] <mpt> czajkowski, that's exactly what I did.
[11:23] <mpt> What are you on about? :-)
[11:24] <czajkowski> 20 bugs
[11:24]  * czajkowski peers at mpt where is my restart later button :)
[11:25] <mpt> czajkowski, listed on Answers.
[11:25] <czajkowski> yes I know
[11:25] <czajkowski> I can see it
[11:25] <czajkowski> shall tackle that shortly
[11:25] <czajkowski> cheers
[12:30] <oly> hum, if i want to push up a personal branch for an existing project do i need to use launchpad to create it first ?
[12:30] <oly> or should i be able to push straight away, only asking as i am getting permission denied but does not tell me why its denied
[12:31] <oly> using bzr push lp:~username/projectname/brnachname
[12:31] <oly> i can work on my own projects so my ssh keys should be good
[12:33] <wgrant> oly: What is the error message?
[12:33] <wgrant> You don't need to create it on Launchpad first.
[12:34] <oly> bzr: ERROR: Permission denied: "~oly/webapps/webapps-applications/googleplus-indicator-counter/": : Cannot create branch at '/~oly/webapps/webapps-applications/googleplus-indicator-counter
[12:35] <wgrant> Ah, there's the problem :)
[12:35] <wgrant> There's an extra path segment in there.
[12:35] <wgrant> 'webapps/webapps-applications' isn't a project name
[12:35] <wgrant> (you probably want to drop the 'webapps/')
[12:37] <oly> your quite right, webapps was the team i think :)
[12:37] <oly> thank you wgrant :)
[12:38] <czajkowski> wgrant: is this our LP do you think ? https://support.one.ubuntu.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=28466
[12:40] <wgrant> czajkowski: No, that's some other Launchpad entirely :/
[12:50] <czajkowski> wgrant: how they end up on ours I'll never knwo
[12:50] <czajkowski> wgrant: can you *please* answer the reply to this rt re differneces https://support.one.ubuntu.com/Ticket/Display.html?id=28022

[14:36] <notgary> Is there anyone here who can answer a question I have about using the Launchpad REST API directly (as opposed to the python lib)?
[14:38] <czajkowski> notgary: best possible to ask on launchpad-dev mailing list tbh
[14:39] <notgary> czajkowski: thanks a lot. I'll do that :)
[14:40] <wgrant> czajkowski, notgary: launchpad-users is the more relevant list
[14:41] <czajkowski> wgrant: ah ok sorry
[14:42] <czajkowski> wgrant: why though ?
[14:44] <wgrant> czajkowski: -dev is for development *of* Launchpad
[14:44] <wgrant> notgary wants to write code against the user-exposed Launchpad API
[14:45] <czajkowski> ahh ok
[14:47] <notgary> czajkowski: wgrant Thanks both for your help :)

[16:11] <fancycode> Hi, I'm trying to upload a source package but get a rejection mail containing only "Further error processing not possible because of a critical previous error." with no further hints - any suggestions what I can do to get a better error description?
[16:15] <mgz> fancycode: only that? see <https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/UploadErrors> for the common issues.
[16:22] <fancycode> yep, only that. first line is "Rejected:", second line is "Further error processing not possible because of a critical previous error.". nothing else
[16:22] <fancycode> successfully uploaded source for lucid into the same ppa yesterday, now trying hardy and it doesn't work

[16:26] <mgz> ...I'd be a little surprised if hardy *did* work... anyway, you need someone who knows the buildds, so I'd post the the launchpad-users mailing lists (find on http://lists.ubuntu.com/)
[16:27] <fancycode> :) well, hardy worked fine in some other ppas yesterday
[16:28] <fancycode> thanks, will post on the mailing list
