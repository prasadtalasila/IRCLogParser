[14:11] <mpt> Is there a "download" icon in the icon theme? I guess there must be.
[14:14] <mpt> Can't find it, though.

[14:37] <xnox> mpt: down pointing green arrow, let me find it for you.
[14:38] <mpt> thanks
[14:39] <mpt> Dear Gimp, showing/hiding a layer is not the type of action that should go into the undo/redo stack
[14:42] <xnox> find /usr/share/icons/ -name '*download*'
[14:42] <xnox> gives me: /usr/share/icons/Humanity/actions/48/browser-download.svg
[14:43] <xnox> /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/places/folder-download-symbolic.svg
[14:43] <xnox> (which is a fancy dotted down arrow)
[14:51] <davidcalle> mpt, hi, I see you have trouble finding icons : do you know about https://launchpad.net/icon-library ?
[14:52] <mpt> davidcalle, I did not!
[14:52] <davidcalle> mpt, it's fantastic. You just need to download it and run the icon-library.py file
[14:52] <davidcalle> life changer :)
[14:55] <mpt> Sweet!
[14:59] <mpt> ...And no, there doesn't seem to be a plain download icon. There's browser-download, cluttered with a disk.
[14:59] <mpt> I guess that's the closest.
[15:10] <xnox> mpt: /usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/emblems/emblem-downloads.png here is one cluttered with progress-bar
[15:10] <mpt> yeah :-)
[15:11] <xnox> /usr/share/icons/unity-icon-theme/places/svg/group-downloads.svg is a generic one, cluttered with a circle and it's not green
[15:11] <mpt> Is there ever a good time to include a progress bar in an icon?
[15:11] <xnox> /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable/places/folder-download-symbolic.svg or dots?! =)
[15:11] <mpt> As opposed to overlaying a genuine progress bar over top of the icon.
[15:12] <xnox> mpt: well it's a clear indication that progress bars lie to you and huge downloads usually stall anyway and one never gets what one wants? =)))))
[17:15]  * mpt wonders if "It's just  a string change!" is the UI equivalent of "It's just a flesh wound!"

[17:58] <mpt> When I insert an audio CD, I get a dialog, "You have just inserted an audio CD. Choose what application to launch."
[17:58] <mpt> The default option is "Ask what to do", but it's ALREADY DONE THAT
[18:24] <xnox> so the drop down default should be moved further down to "Lauch Music Player Rhythmbox"?
[18:24] <xnox> yeah that option doesn't make sense. cause i want to keep it asking what to do & offer what to do _now_ at the same time.
