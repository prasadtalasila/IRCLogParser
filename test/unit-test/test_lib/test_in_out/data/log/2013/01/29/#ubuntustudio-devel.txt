[13:30] <contrapunctus> "I don't think ubuntu studio is even maintained. They just package a bunch of crap together and in theory would work. I don't think they do bug fixes or anything like that."

[13:31] <contrapunctus> This was on a prominent Linux pro audio forum.
[13:31] <contrapunctus> Can anyone comment on how accurate this is? o.O

[15:01] <smartboyhw> hello all....
[15:18] <contrapunctus> Hello again, smartboyhw ;)
[15:18] <smartboyhw> contrapunctus, hello
[15:20] <contrapunctus> saidinesh5: Mate, where you from?
[15:20] <saidinesh5> hey contrapunctus..... i m from India....
[15:20] <saidinesh5> ssup?
[15:20] <contrapunctus> Me too :)
[15:20] <saidinesh5> oh?
[15:20] <saidinesh5> from?
[15:20] <contrapunctus> Delhi ^^
[15:20] <saidinesh5> Ah 
[15:20] <saidinesh5> Hyd
[15:20] <saidinesh5> ssup?
[15:21] <contrapunctus> Didn't know there were other UbuntuStudio folks in India! :)
[15:21] <contrapunctus> You a dev?
[15:21] <saidinesh5> Ah well...... not of ubuntu studio.... i work on a different software
[15:21] <saidinesh5> which i someday
[15:21] <saidinesh5> want to get included into ubuntu studio
[15:22] <saidinesh5> let me guess.... you stumbled across ubuntu studio from that coursera course? :P
[15:22] <contrapunctus> Coursera course? O.o
[15:22] <contrapunctus> Naw
[15:22] <saidinesh5> Ah
[15:22] <saidinesh5> it started right today
[15:22] <contrapunctus> Wanted to stop using Windows...tried installing Ubuntu LTS (the very first one)
[15:22] <saidinesh5> digital sound design
[15:22] <saidinesh5> Aah
[15:23] <saidinesh5> lol what do you mean by the very first one?
[15:23] <contrapunctus> The first LTS
[15:23] <saidinesh5> you mean the 6.04 or somethin?
[15:23] <contrapunctus> Yeah.
[15:23] <saidinesh5> O_O
[15:23] <saidinesh5> where did you even get that DVD?
[15:23] <contrapunctus> Real crappy choice for a beginner, abandoned it for AVLinux soon after
[15:23] <saidinesh5> Ahh you mean back when you started.....
[15:23] <saidinesh5> lol
[15:23] <contrapunctus> Settled on Ubuntu Studio+KXstudio since the last few months
[15:24] <contrapunctus> I got it off the internet, lol.
[15:24] <saidinesh5> ya i guess i gave ubuntu studio a try back during 8.04 days i guess
[15:24] <saidinesh5> Ah yes
[15:24] <saidinesh5> KXStudio is quite nice.......
[15:24] <saidinesh5> kudos to falktx
[15:24] <contrapunctus> Hell yeah.
[15:24] <contrapunctus> You do music as well? o.o
[15:25] <saidinesh5> yep
[15:28] <contrapunctus> Back to practice ^^
[15:46] <smartboyhw> holstein, write me a testimonial at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/smartboyhw please:)
[15:50] <smartboyhw> astraljava, could you also write one for me?
[16:59] <Lumpy> hey holstein are there any requirement to join the dev team over there at launchpad?
[17:00] <holstein> Lumpy: not sure
[17:00] <zequence> Lumpy: Yes
[17:00] <holstein> Lumpy: lets ask scott when he's around
[17:00] <holstein> maybe zequence can do it?
[17:01] <zequence> The dev team means you get access to Ubuntu Studio bzr branches, and a lot of other things. 
[17:01] <holstein> Lumpy: im sure we can get you envolved
[17:01] <zequence> You don't need that in order to help out with development though
[17:01] <zequence> Lumpy: What is it that you are most interested in doing?
[17:01] <Lumpy> i would certainly be willing to test things
[17:01] <Lumpy> i already always report crashes and such
[17:02] <Lumpy> if they are relaqtively stable i would be willing to go to nightly builds
[17:02] <zequence> Lumpy: We don't have a procedure for that yet, but you are always welcome to install the development release
[17:02] <zequence> And do test installs as well
[17:03] <zequence> We don't really require doing install tests much right now
[17:03] <Lumpy> okay, i will look into that in the next few days
[17:03] <Lumpy> i need to get back to making nickles and dimes on the machine atm
[17:03] <Lumpy> so no installs today
[17:03] <Lumpy> but i am sure i can set up another partition
[17:03] <zequence> As for individual applications, the desktop, and things like that, I guess it's good to just try things out, and if you find  a bug, report it.
[17:03] <Lumpy> i think i have like six operating systems on the beast atm
[17:04] <Lumpy> i use xfce for my desktop on my resource deprived machine
[17:04] <zequence> I have one install of every 32 and 64 bit since 12.04, only for testing atm
[17:04] <zequence> Plus a development platform, using Quantal
[17:05] <Lumpy> I only have one 64 bit machine and it is an oddball
[17:06] <Lumpy> a mac G5
[17:06] <Lumpy> running xubuntu
[17:08] <zequence> Lumpy: You don't need both. 
[17:08] <zequence> I have all of those only because I need to test the lowlatency kernel every time I update it
[17:09] <Lumpy> oh i didn't think that... just letting you know what i do have was all
[17:09] <Lumpy> i don't run the low latency in studio atm
[17:09] <zequence> Lumpy: You'd be fine with just the development release of Ubuntu Studio for whatever arch you have, currently 13.04 32bit
[17:09] <Lumpy> but i do in tango studio
[17:12] <holstein> is tango using our lowlatency kernel?
[17:12] <holstein> PPC support is brutal
[17:13] <Lumpy> i know that on the PPC
[17:13] <Lumpy> it took me almost two weeks just to get something installed
[17:13] <holstein> i was just explaing to someone what a drag it can be
[17:13] <Lumpy> and i am not sure what kernel tango is using exactly
[17:13] <holstein> had a G4.. a 700mhz.. i was just saying, move on and let it go
[17:13] <holstein> you can dig a computer like that out of the trash these days
[17:13] <Lumpy> 99% of the time the machine is running in your 12.04 with the generic kernel
[17:14] <holstein> a 64bit G5 is a bit more of a toss up though
[17:14] <Lumpy> i would have to boot the os and do a uname to be sure
[17:14] <holstein> thats still got some life left
[17:14] <Lumpy> it is one of the real early ones
[17:14] <Lumpy> two single core 64 bit cpus
[17:14] <holstein> i run one G4 X less and headless sometimes
[17:14] <Lumpy> but it saves me about 30% on post production matters
[17:15]  * Lumpy timed it with a stop watch and compared it to his 32 bit dual core intel
[17:15] <zequence> Lumpy: Testing is actually very important for us. We need to catch bugs, and report them upstream much sooner, and more agressively than in the past
[17:15] <Lumpy> i would be willing to do that
[17:15] <Lumpy> and i would love to see if i can get this jack running on my PPC
[17:16] <zequence> Lumpy: Won't work
[17:16] <holstein> Lumpy: i didnt have very good luck
[17:16] <zequence> jackd1, but not jackd2
[17:16] <Lumpy> but that is not a real critical issue
[17:16] <zequence> There's a bug in jackd2 that stops it from working on PPC
[17:16] <Lumpy> it runs great on the dual core 32 bit
[17:16] <Lumpy> brb
[17:17] <zequence> I got an iBook3 a few weeks ago. Installed Debian. Managed to compile a -rt kernel for it. But, jackd2 didn't work
[17:17]  * zequence is going running
[17:22] <Lumpy> i wish i could run anymore
[17:22] <Lumpy> i have to settle for walks 
[17:22] <Lumpy> my back and knees won't take the running anymore
[18:37] <zequence> Lumpy: If you like, i could introduce you to some of the structure we have for development
[18:37] <zequence> Lumpy: We follow blueprints. A blueprint for us is sort of like a topic. Each blueprint has a set of work items that we try get done
[18:38] <zequence> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/Blueprints
[18:39] <zequence> Lumpy: Here's an example of a blueprint on launchpad. It's called workflows, and is the root for all our workflows https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/topic-ubuntustudio-r-workflows
[18:39] <zequence> You can click the clouds below to get to other related blueprints, up and down the tree of dependencies
[18:41] <zequence> Lumpy: If you find something you feel you can do, just add yourself to the work item. If you come with ideas, talk with someone about it, or just add a workitem yourself. It takes a little time to get into managing that stuff
[19:02] <Lumpy> i will look it over a bit later today or tomorrow
[19:02] <Lumpy> unfortunately i need to crank out some online work to pay the bills
