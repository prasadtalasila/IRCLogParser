[12:27] <bizhanMona> Spamaps: Thanks for replay, where can I get more info for what upstart uses dbus? Thx 
[13:28] <xnox> bizhanMona: the source code? =)
[13:29] <xnox> bizhanMona: initctl uses dbus to talk to upstart. and there is also dbus interface to query status & launch stuff. in trunk there is support for jobs to start/stop on dbus events.
[13:30] <xnox> there is some dated information here http://upstart.ubuntu.com/wiki/DBusInterface
[13:30] <xnox> i'm not sure we auto-generate dbus docs or not.
[13:36] <jodh> bizhanMona: also some example here - http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#controlling-upstart-using-d-bus
[16:51] <ah-> hi, i have an embedded arm board that usually boots with sysv scripts, and instead of/after booting that I want it to chroot to a loopback image of a different distribution that's based on upstart and continue booting that
[16:52] <ah-> my problem is that I can't just chroot and start upstart afterwards, since that would mean that upstart isn't pid 1
[16:53] <xnox> use lxc, then upstart can become pid1
[16:53] <xnox> lxc is chroot + a couple fancy tricks on top. it's the way to do stuff like that.
[16:54] <ah-> thanks, i'll look into that, seems like a good fit
[16:54] <ah-> does it require kernel support?
[16:55] <xnox> ah-: also your case sounds a lot like initramfs -> root hand over, which does also give up pid1 and let the other instance take over.
[16:55] <ah-> my real problem is that i can't/don't want to flash a new kernel/uboot config since that's a bit risky
[16:55] <xnox> ah-: lxc? yeah but pretty much any recentish kernels support that. even like android kernels and what not.
[16:55] <xnox> check, you might have lxc enabled.
[17:13] <ah-> xnox: unfortunately a lot is missing: http://nopaste.me/paste/629141865510aa60037d45
[17:13] <xnox> ah-: then look how initramfs does handover.
[17:15] <ah-> i'm on it, thanks for the hint
[17:26] <ah-> xnox: great, that looks pretty much like the thing i've been searching for. i'll just omit the rm -rf / part of it and then it should be fine
[17:26] <xnox> np, your welcome =)
[17:34] <bizhanMona> xnox: Thanks for your info, I am trying to catch up fast on this. One question when you say "in trunk ..."  do you mean is not part of the main release? thx
[17:34] <bizhanMona> jodh: thanks for pointer
[17:35] <xnox> bizhanMona: yeah, that event bridge got merged into lp:upstart. We will soon have an upstart release with that feature in.
[17:35] <xnox> bizhanMona: even sooner we might get a usable rc / testing ppa.
[17:36] <bizhanMona> xnox: this great thanks so much. Is there a mailing list that I can subscribe to get the future development releases? thx
[17:38] <xnox> bizhanMona: there is upstart-devel mailing list, but it has also code-review and patches going to it. https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/upstart-devel
[17:38] <xnox> bizhanMona: just announcements of new releases are via RSS https://launchpad.net/upstart/+announcements
[17:40] <bizhanMona> xnox: thanks so much for all the info.
[17:41] <xnox> bizhanMona: =) no problem. We are a friendly bunch here, when online ;-)
[19:45] <ndimatteo> hey all, I was hoping I could get some help with an upstart job for running forever.js
