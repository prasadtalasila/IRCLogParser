[06:43] <Len-nb> zequence, and anyone else, put some email on the list about sample rates.
[12:28] <ttoine> hello
[13:31] <zequence> Len-nb: I don't have a specific opinion about 44.1/48kHz. I tend to use 48kHz by default, but that's just me
[13:31] <zequence> ttoine: What's up?
[13:33] <zequence> Len-nb: Did you follow the thread on jack devel list about graphic drivers, packaging, etc
[14:19] <len-1304> zequence, nope, I can only follow so many things :)
[14:22] <zequence> len-1304: Well, las brought up bad Ubuntu packaging. I answered, and it led to me posting the diff between quantal and it's Debian source
[14:23] <zequence> Hopefully people will start to blame Ubuntu for everything
[14:23] <zequence> stop*
[14:23] <zequence> :P
[14:23] <len-1304> Ya.
[14:24] <scott-work> good morning
[14:24] <astraljava> It's only natural. You know how the best bands in the world are always those nobody has ever heard of.
[14:25] <zequence> scott-work: good morning Texas (is that where you live?)
[14:25] <zequence> astraljava: I'm guessing that was meant for another channel? :)
[14:26] <astraljava> zequence: Nope. In reference to the ubuntu-hatin'.
[14:27] <len-1304> band should be brand?
[14:27] <astraljava> It was a metaphor. I think.
[14:27] <zequence> But aren't we the best, and the most famous?!!
[14:28] <zequence> ..and let's not forget, the best looking
[14:34] <scott-work> zequence: aye, i live in texas
=== jta is now known as jta_afk
[15:01] <astraljava> zequence: The train of thought being it's fashionable to badmouth the famous.
[15:09] <zequence> astraljava: right
=== jta_afk is now known as jta
