[01:05] <raevol> philipballew: the safety razor is amazing
[01:05] <raevol> not as manly as the straight razor, but way better/faster/easier shave
[01:05] <bkerensa> philipballew: so Mozilla is sending a huge team from around the world to man a booth :) do you think you can install Ubuntu on one of the laptops Mozilla IT is sending?
[01:16] <raevol> PHILIPBALLEW WHERE DID YOU GO
[01:16] <raevol> T_T
[03:01] <pleia2> akk: I was reading that thread out of car-crash fascination, so thank you for cheering me up with your message :)
[03:01] <akk> pleia2: I try to stay out of Rick wars, but I couldn't help myself this time. :)
[03:02] <akk> I was reading some of the great "I've looked it up and yes, charter schools really are public schools" posts
[03:02] <akk> and mentally composing private mail I was going to send to them, but it kept boiling down to "Thanks for injecting facts, I haven't posted publically because I'm too much a coward"
[03:02] <akk> so I posted. :)
[03:03] <pleia2> yeah, I don't have the energy for it right now
[03:03] <grantbow> akk: thank you, we need more voices of reason in such discussions
[03:04] <pleia2> oops, mt view coming up, time to get off zee train
[03:04] <grantbow> it is quite the car-crash
[03:04] <grantbow> cya
[03:04] <akk> I was also thinking of a friend who posts to alt.origins -- he told me once he knows he's never going to convince the intelligent design people to change their minds
[03:04] <akk> but he posts because of all the lurkers there, because reasoned arguments might change some of *their* minds
[03:05] <akk> so I thought, hey, maybe there are people on the fence now about whether to support Partimus, I could talk to them.

[16:46] <akk> How can I get /usr/share/dict/words? It's gone missing in pangolin -- it's a symlink pointing to /etc/dictionaries-common/words, and apt-file doesn't find any package that would install that.
[16:49] <akk> Ah, found it, wamerican (it's only available for american?) -- needed apt-file search words | grep dict | egrep '/words$ (though that also lists the useless symlink in dictionaries-common).
