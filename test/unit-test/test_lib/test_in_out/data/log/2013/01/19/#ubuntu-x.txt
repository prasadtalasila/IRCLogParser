[02:54] <bryce> I've uploaded new xdiagnose.  All tests pass and scripts work and bug filing appears to work, to the limit I can test it locally, so I don't expect any problems, but ping me if you spot anything weird this weekend.
[03:24] <mlankhorst> bryce: wont do anything this weekend, had to spend today dealing with lts stack, looks like I might need to re-enable the shared libgallium patch for mesa due to disk space on iso
[03:33] <bryce> mlankhorst, good plan taking the weekend off
[03:36] <mlankhorst> for now plan is to unrename libdrm (uploaded/accepted, rebuilds are pending), fix up plymouth to no longer require intel on arm (sponsored), and maybe re-enable the gallium patch, pending testing :)
[09:10] <jibel_> bryce, xdiagnose 3.4 is broken on raring bug 1101688

[22:55] <Azelphur> Hi folks, trying to get Steam running on Ubuntu 12.10, problem is when I install fglrx-updates, or install the latest version of fglrx from the website, Unity doesn't start at all. Ideas?
[23:13] <mlankhorst> does glxinfo work?
[23:20] <bryce> mlankhorst, thought you weren't working this weekend?  ;-)
[23:21] <mlankhorst> blegh I keep irc open for other channels
[23:21] <bryce> mlankhorst, I'm just teasing ;-)
[23:22] <bryce> Azelphur, see the topic
[23:22] <Azelphur> bryce: https://bugs.launchpad.net/fglrx/+bug/1068661 seems there is already an active topic on the subject, https://bugs.launchpad.net/fglrx/+bug/1068661
[23:22] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1068404 in xserver-xorg-video-intel (openSUSE) "duplicate for #1068661 Low graphics mode in muxless hybrid ATI/Intel GPU systems after fglrx upgrade" [Critical,In progress]
[23:22] <Azelphur> Unless you want me to go break it again and file a new bug?
[23:23] <Azelphur> Although, I'm not on a hybrid, this is just a standard desktop with a 7770 in it
[23:24] <bryce> Azelphur, filing a bug also copies up your log files, which people generally need if you're going to ask them for help
[23:24] <Azelphur> righto, I'll go do that, just get it into the broken state and run ubuntu-bug xorg?
[23:25] <bryce> Azelphur, besides, it's possible you *don't* have the same bug.  And if you do, having a new set of logs can help confirm that.  Setting two bugs as dupes is cheap and easy for us.
[23:25] <Azelphur> yea I agree, will get that done for you now :)
[23:25] <bryce> Azelphur, that's right.
[23:26] <bryce> update to latest before you do that; I stuck in some bugfixes today for the apport hook.
[23:26] <Azelphur> ok, just standard Ubuntu 12.10 update?
[23:27] <bryce> oh, thought you were on raring; nevermind
[23:27] <Azelphur> nope, pretty normal 12.10 install :)
[23:48] <Azelphur> bryce: there we go, #1101948 :)
[23:52] <bryce> [    16.313] (EE) fglrx(0): Fail to init MGPU configuration:0x0!
[23:52] <bryce> [    16.456] (EE) fglrx(0): atiddxDriScreenInit failed. Probably kernel module missing or incompatible. 
[23:53] <Azelphur> interesting, that means the problem is in fglrx?
[23:53] <bryce> yeah kernel module probably failed to build
[23:53] <Azelphur> fun
[23:53] <bryce> check your dkms and make.log files for errors
[23:54] <Azelphur> where are they at?
[23:56] <bryce> and probably you fscked your system by also installing the drivers from AMD's site.
[23:56] <Azelphur> well, I only did that after experiencing the issue in the first place, and I built the .deb packages and installed them as instructed on the Ubuntu help pages :)
[23:57] <Azelphur> so baring in mind I only ever installed / removed the built packages, should be fine?
[23:58] <bryce> dunno, sometimes packages leave cruft config files and stuff around
[23:58]  * Azelphur shrugs
[23:59] <Azelphur> but yea, how do I check dkms and where is make.log? :)
