[08:43] <mybro> hello!  I've just installed the Ubuntu QML toolkit preview and am trying to go through the initial tutorial (currency converter)
[08:44] <mybro> Qt Creator isn't recognizing Ubuntu.Components when I try to import.  Does anyone know where in the file system the kit is copied and where in Qt Creator I can point to it?
[14:45] <kicker22004> anyone up?
[14:47] <commandoline> argh, just writing 'just ask' nicely :S
