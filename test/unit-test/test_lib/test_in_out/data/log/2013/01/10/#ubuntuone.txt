[11:23] <gatox> good morning!
[11:52] <kali_> hi. is the mac packaging stuff in any repo?
[12:40] <mandel> kali_, what exaclty do you mean?
[14:05] <kali_> mandel: sorry. I was wondering if I could find somewhere the sources used to build the mac package for the ubuntuone-client
[14:47] <ralsina> kali_: sure, it's in launchpad
[14:48] <ralsina> kali_: you can start from the badly-named ubuntuone-windows-installer
[14:48] <ralsina> kali_: it is a bit of a mess to build though :-)
[14:51] <kali_> ralsina: thanks!
[14:52] <ralsina> kali_: np, if you see mmcc here, he knows best
