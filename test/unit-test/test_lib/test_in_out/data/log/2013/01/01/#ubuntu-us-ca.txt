=== erichammond1 is now known as erichammond
[20:30] <grantbow> Am I alone in still feeling concerned about the potentially misunderstood Amazon search feature in 12.10+
[20:30] <grantbow> I noticed this trick from the EFF article no longer works in 13.04 alpha
[20:30] <grantbow> sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping
[20:34] <geofft> Hrm, LP #1054746 implies you can do System Settings | Privacy and uncheck "Include online search results"
[20:36] <grantbow> probably can, but the package trick didn't work when I tried it last.

[20:36] <geofft> yeah, the idea was that they specifically want a better UI for this than uninstalling
[20:36] <geofft> In part because that's obscure and not discoverable
[20:36] <MarkDude> Advice on a Linux happy laptop?
[20:36]  * MarkDude is getting one for his Bday
[20:37] <geofft> And, it looks like, in part because it might not just be this one lens
[20:37] <MarkDude> Pondering Lenovo
[20:38]  * MarkDude gets nervous nowadays hearing word *lens*
[20:38] <MarkDude> :D
[20:39] <grantbow> that UI doesn't address all the concerns outlined here. https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/10/privacy-ubuntu-1210-amazon-ads-and-data-leaks

[20:44] <MarkDude> uh bad timing I guess
[20:44]  * MarkDude will ask later
[20:49] <geofft> MarkDude: isn't approximately every laptop Linux happy these days? :)
[20:49] <geofft> Lenovos are great. what in particular are you looking at / what do you want?
[20:50] <MarkDude> Enough power to use GIMP
[20:50] <MarkDude> HDMI out
[20:50] <MarkDude> and a reasonable price (gf is getting it for gift for me)
[20:51] <MarkDude> Apple would be nice- but that money goes to the Evil Empire
[20:51] <MarkDude> :D
[20:53]  * MarkDude is prepared to put in a decent wifi card if needed
[20:54] <MarkDude> Hmmmm, maybe I should ask the *knower of all things * akk :)
[20:54] <geofft> yeah, make sure you get the Intel wifi
[20:55] <MarkDude> No doubt
[20:58] <MarkDude> thx geofft
[20:58]  * MarkDude is off to lunch
[21:20] <philipballew> Gareth, whens a good time to have a meeting with you to talk about this SCaLE Youth thing?
