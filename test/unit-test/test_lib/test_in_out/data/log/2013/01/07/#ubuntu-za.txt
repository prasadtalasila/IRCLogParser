[05:12] <Squirm> Trixar_za: cause I have work in 20min. what's your excuse? :P
[05:12] <Squirm> wait, an excuse shouldn't be needed if you're up this early. unless, like you I'd think, have been up all night :P
[05:12] <Trixar_za> Lies
[05:12] <Trixar_za> Only part of the night
[05:13] <Trixar_za> Been looking for a ebook management site script

[07:04] <Kilos> young
[07:04] <Squirm> I think in the past 3 weeks, I've been out of bed before 8:30 maybe 3 times
[07:04] <superfly> Squirm: 3 years old, and 10 months old.
[07:05] <superfly> they are late sleepers, they only wake up at 7am
[07:05] <Squirm> superfly: see, I think I'm still too young for children anyway :P
[07:05] <superfly> Squirm: how old are you?
[07:05] <Kilos> they sleep better after 8 to 10
[07:05] <Squirm> damn, boss sent me a whatsapp 45min ago, but he knows I don't get reception in our office :/
[07:05] <Squirm> superfly: 21
[07:06] <Squirm> hmm, 22 in 2 months, wow time flies
[07:07] <superfly> Squirm: ah, OK. mrs_fly was 21 when our eldest was born.
[07:07] <Squirm> that's why I said "I think I'm still too young", I know, different people different opinions. If it makes them happy then so be it :D
[07:08] <Squirm> I still hate waking up early :/
[07:08] <Squirm> probably because I like going to sleep late
[07:08] <Squirm> oh yes, bbl

[15:08] <Kilos> written by peeps that is
[15:09] <Kilos> mine seems to have same plugins as maaz unless i missed something
[15:09] <Kilos> what does your plugin do?
[15:09] <superfly> I don't know, I don't know of any other than those that come with ibid (and my and kbmonkey's plugins)
[15:10] <superfly> it just provides a way to get a summary of a bug on launchpad 
[15:10] <superfly> (currently)
[15:10] <Kilos> oo you want me to test it
[15:12] <superfly> no, it's fine, it undergoes regular abuse, I mean, use.
[15:12] <Kilos> lol
[15:13] <superfly> I wrote it a long time ago... probably more than a year ago now

[17:57] <Maaz> Kilos: That didn't go down very well. Burp.
[17:57] <kbmonkey> he ate your words
[17:58] <magespawn> Symmetria: ping

[17:58] <Maaz> Kilos: I use the following features for conversions: base, base64, currency, dvorak, morse, rot13, timezone, translate, unicode and units
[17:58] <Maaz> Ask me "how do I use ..." for more details.
[17:58] <magespawn> Maaz convert 3 ft to cm
[17:58] <Maaz> magespawn: That didn't go down very well. Burp.
[17:59] <magespawn> Maaz how do I use conversions?
[17:59] <Maaz> magespawn: I'm afraid I don't know what you are asking about. Ask "what can you do" to browse my features.
[17:59] <Kilos> Maaz, what can you do with conversions
[17:59] <Maaz> Kilos: Erk, dunno
[18:00] <kbmonkey> Maaz, help conversions
[18:00] <Maaz> kbmonkey: I'm afraid I don't know what you are asking about. Ask "what can you do" to browse my features.
[18:00] <kbmonkey> enough! you silly bot you. hush now.
[18:03] <Kilos> magespawn, whats the prob with the router
[18:10] <magespawn> do not know the username and paassword, also do not anything about cisco routers
[18:12] <Kilos> eek
[18:13] <Kilos> even routers have usernames and password
[18:13] <kbmonkey> magespawn, did you try search it's model and find a default login?
[18:13] <kbmonkey> if the default was changed, you may need to reset the router
[18:14] <magespawn> have reset and still no luck
[18:15] <magespawn> i can telnet to it and use the default password but that is about it
[18:16] <inetpro> magespawn: what you wanna do with a router that you don't have a username and password for?
[18:17] <kbmonkey> if the passwd for telnet works, where else does it not want to work? like it's admin page?
[18:17] <kbmonkey> web amdin
[18:17] <magespawn> i have been loaned it because its adsl port is fritzed, so it has been replaced
[18:17] <magespawn> inetpro^
[18:18] <inetpro> hmm...
[18:18] <magespawn> thats right kbmonkey
[18:18] <inetpro> magespawn: does it have a serial port?
[18:18] <Kilos> http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/hw/routers/ps259/products_password_recovery09186a0080094675.shtml
[18:19] <kbmonkey> if it runs embedded *nix, wonder if you can telnet in, and use 'users' and 'passwd' to reset them.
[18:19] <magespawn> it has a console port but i have never used one and it uses a different cable apprently
[18:19] <inetpro> or rather a console port
[18:20] <inetpro> get one of them blue console cables and google is your friend
[18:21] <magespawn> have done a hardware reset, and can telnet in using cisco and cisco, but then drops me at a prompt like this yourname#
[18:22] <magespawn> with instructions to change the username and password which do not work
[18:22] <inetpro> magespawn: find the manual online
[18:23] <magespawn> busy going through the cisco support website now
[18:24] <kbmonkey> hopefully it's brain isn't also frizzed
[18:26] <Kilos> Maaz, google firmware for cisco routers
