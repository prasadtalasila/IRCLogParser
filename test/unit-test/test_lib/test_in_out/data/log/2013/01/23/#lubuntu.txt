[00:49] <aguitel> how configure menu items ?
[00:51] <aguitel> alacarte install many gnome packages
[00:54] <Unit193> Pretty sure it doesn't work well with Lubuntu either.  I'd try MenuLibre, it's still got a few bugs, but if you're good with that and if you report them even better.
[01:33] <aguitel> Unit193, thanks
[02:03] <alexandros_c> good day has anyone been able to get brother mfc-j425w scanner to work under lubuntu if you have how did you do it?
[02:07] <Unit193> alexandros_c: I have no idea if it is in the repos, but http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#MFC-J425W looks good!
[02:09] <alexandros_c> Unit193: thanks but I have that installed but it is not working. However, under Debian I was able to get it working. Any other suggestions?
[02:09] <Unit193> !printers
[02:09] <ubottu> Printing in Ubuntu is done with cups. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Printers - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsPrinters - http://linuxprinting.org - Printer sharing: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu
[02:10] <Unit193> (That being my only other one)
[02:12] <alexandros_c> not printing, scanning is the problem
[02:14] <Unit193> You install a good scanning program?
[02:15] <Unit193> (Sorry, changed my thought from scan to print due to brother. :P )
[02:17] <alexandros_c> lol, that is ok
[02:18] <Unit193> I could do...
[02:18] <Unit193> !scan
[02:18] <alexandros_c> the printer part I figure out
[02:18] <ubottu> Scanning software: Simple-Scan (GNOME), Xsane, the GIMP (GNOME), Kooka (KDE). For instructions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ScanningHowTo and to see supported hardware: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsScanners - See also !OCR
[02:18] <Unit193> alexandros_c: Printers seem easier, I had a Epson working a while ago, but it's really been a while.
[02:18] <alexandros_c> :)

[09:49] <hateball> Can I edit the "open removable media" menu somehow? If I insert a DVD and choose to play with VLC it wont open the device, it'll just open a blank VLC. I'd rather it ran "vlc /my/dev"

[11:06] <tata> how to install some "weather report" which its work on lubuntu 10.4
[11:16] <tata> I try someone but not operate!
[12:02] <Guido93> hello everyone, i need help. i really doesn't understand how to install win 7 and lubuntu to have both in the same computer

[12:02] <Guido93> i'm trying hard but really it seems me impossible.
[12:03] <Guido93> thanks now i read, also if i have already read much things.. let see
[12:03] <Unit193> Generally, installing Win7 first is best.
[12:05] <Guido93> yes, i have tried all! but lubuntu then doesn't see win7 and want to cancel all. if i done first lubuntu, else, it is windows that can't write on a partition free because he says that the partition is of the type mgbr or something similar.. however now i read your suggest link :)
[12:06] <Unit193> How new is the computer?  Might you have UEFI?
[12:07] <Guido93> yes, for example now i have installed windows 7. i am in the installing process of lubuntu and i am choosing the partition for him. but him doesn't see windows 7! he says that i have all partition free, 500gb/500gb else i have just installed win 7 on 430gb/500gb and left free 70gb where i wanted to install lubuntu
[12:07] <Unit193> !uefi
[12:07] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[12:07] <Guido93> yes the computer is new, probably i have uefi. but i don't know how to beat him :|
[12:07] <Unit193> It's a bit different, needs a little more.
[12:08] <Unit193> I've only installed a Ubuntu flavor once on UEFI hardware, but it wasn't too bad once you had a handy doc.
[12:08] <Guido93> this is new to read :) i try! thanks again
[12:09] <Unit193> Sure, hope you get it.
