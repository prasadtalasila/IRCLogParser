[12:48] <WebVisitor-2> Hey there! I need help with configuring touch gestures (duh)
[12:49] <WebVisitor-2> I'm on 12.10, on a Lenovo B570 laptop and have installed touchegg, but I'm only able to use the two fingers to scroll gesture, which is already installed by default
[12:50] <WebVisitor-2> so I'd love to know if there is any easy tutorial to follow to get three finger and four finger gestures working, so it behaves like OSX. (With natural scrolling and all)
[13:06] <dandrader> WebVisitor-2,  3 and 4 finger gestures are captured by Unity. So you won't be able to use them in applications
[13:07] <dandrader> 3 finger gestures move and maximize/restore windows. 4 finger taps show and hide the dash
[13:07] <dandrader> 4 finger double taps = alt+tab, etc
[13:08] <dandrader> I mean, 3 finger double tap
[13:08] <WebVisitor-2> If I try any of the 3 finger gestures to minimize a window, or something, it doesn't work

[13:09] <dandrader> the list of gestures is here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch

[13:10] <Visitor_Max> could the touchpad be a factor?
[13:10] <Visitor_Max> if 2 finger gestures work, will 3 finger stuff work per se
[13:10] <dandrader> no
[13:11] <dandrader> it depends on how many simultaneous and independent touches your trackpad supports
[13:11] <dandrader> there are several trackpads that support only two simultaneous touch points, for instance
[13:11] <Visitor_Max> any way to check?
[13:12] <Visitor_Max> I don't even see my trackpad listed in lsinput
[13:12] <dandrader> xinput test-xi2 <device>
[13:13] <Visitor_Max> sorry if that gets really noobish, but how do I know what dev my trackpad is?
[13:13] <dandrader> it's been a while since I last used this tool (xinput) though,  so I don't recall its usage details
[13:14] <dandrader> this xinput tool can list the available input devices
[13:14] <Visitor_Max> k I'll see
[13:14] <dandrader> just run it without any parameters
[13:14] <Visitor_Max> list did the trick
[13:15] <Visitor_Max> it's id11, so I'll try that in xinput, one moment
[13:16] <Visitor_Max> won't react to three finger inputs
[13:16] <Visitor_Max> guess I'm out of luck, then
[13:16] <Visitor_Max> do you know an easy way to get pinch to zoom and inverted scrolling working?
[13:18] <dandrader> on
[13:18] <dandrader> no
[13:27] <WebVisitor-6> sorry got disconnected. did you write anything?
