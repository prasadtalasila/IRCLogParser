[01:16] <lubuntu13> Hey guys. I used Lubuntu 13.04 with my Macbook 2,1 and the wireless worked well (except for the occasional drop in connection). I decided to install Ubuntu 12.10 instead in the meantime and now the wireless is not working, it connects but then has ridiculous pings to 192.168.1.1 and 800ms pings to google.com when it even gets a response. QUESTION: does Lubuntu use a different WiFi driver than
[01:16] <lubuntu13> Ubuntu? Big thanks in advance.

[17:36] <Unit193> Well howdy.

[18:05] <FlowRiser> Hey all, i'm just installing Lubuntu 12.10; Any tips on what toi do first after installation on a netbook ?
[18:18] <holstein> kristian-aalborg: YO!
[18:19] <holstein> the way i see it, these EEE's are disposable.. i dont worry about heat or anything much with them
[18:34] <kristian-aalborg> holstein, you're probably right
[18:35] <holstein> kristian-aalborg: i just make sure im comfortable getting a year or so out of them.. at the price i pay for them
[18:35] <holstein> kristian-aalborg: so far, its been hardware that has been the issue... vga ribbons mostly
[18:39] <kristian-aalborg> not mine :)
[18:50] <holstein> kristian-aalborg: i have 4 EEE's.. and 2 other netbooks, in various states of repair

[20:43] <qwebirc9047> Hello.  Using EITHER the alternate installation CD OR desktop installation CD, is it possible to screen-capture _every_ aspect of installation, including for example, the entire screen text of every installer screen when using the alternate installation CD's text-based installer, or a screenshot of every instaler GUI page/screen when using the desktop installation CD's GUI installer?
