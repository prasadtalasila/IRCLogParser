[16:12] <shadeslayer> tjaalton: I think flash is making my GPU do this : [18022.896878] [drm:i915_hangcheck_hung] *ERROR* Hangcheck timer elapsed... GPU hung
[16:12] <shadeslayer> I was watching a flash video and the GPU just hanged again
[16:13] <tjaalton> with sna?
[16:16] <shadeslayer> yes
[16:19] <tjaalton> can you do a vt change?
[16:20] <shadeslayer> err ... I already restarted X
[16:20] <shadeslayer> but I have the i915_error_state file
[16:20] <shadeslayer> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1537992/
[16:22] <tjaalton> can you reproduce it?
[16:24] <shadeslayer> I'll try
[16:25] <tjaalton> i'll update the driver to 2.20.18
[16:25] <shadeslayer> ty
[16:26] <tjaalton> no idea if it helps there
[16:30] <shadeslayer> well ... I can't reproduce :(
[16:31] <tjaalton> the error state is similar to 1099394
[16:58] <shadeslayer> tjaalton: should I upload my error state to that bug?
[17:12] <tjaalton> shadeslayer: file a new one just to be sure
[17:12] <tjaalton> did you get the apport dialog about it?
[17:12] <shadeslayer> nope
[17:15] <tjaalton> meh
[17:15] <tjaalton> running kde?
[17:15] <shadeslayer> yep
[17:15] <tjaalton> install xdiagnose
[17:15] <shadeslayer> I already have that
[17:15] <tjaalton> sigh
[17:15] <tjaalton> ok
[17:16] <tjaalton> just leave it then
[17:16] <shadeslayer> oh okay
[17:28] <tjaalton> install the new driver and try to break it again :)
[17:40] <shadeslayer> tjaalton: heh okay :D
