[11:30] <maswan> Hey, any reason for not building the kernels with CONFIG_NFS_V4_1? Even RHEL has it these days, and it is fairly annoying to have to maintain custom kernels just to be able to mount our storage...
[11:42]  * ppisati -> out for lunch
[12:10] <jpds> maswan: Someone likely just needs to add it, Debian got it recently: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=+627655
[12:15] <maswan> Hope someone<tm> does it soon then. :)
[12:18] <henrix> maswan: i'm not aware of any reason not to include this option, but if you want it included, the best way is to open a bug with this request
[12:20] <maswan> will do
[12:22] <apw> henrix, isn't it on in raring already?
[12:22] <maswan> would be most excellent if it could make it's way to a precise update too.
[12:22] <maswan> or is that too invasive?
[12:23] <apw> debian.master/config/config.common.ubuntu:CONFIG_NFS_V4_1=y
[12:23] <apw> so definatly already in raring
[12:23] <maswan> excellent
[12:23] <apw> it is not on in Q so I assume not before that either.  turning it on in older releases is harder, it would definatly need a bug, and lots of testing
[12:24] <henrix> apw: yes, its in raring
[12:24] <henrix> i checked in P and Q, and it is not there
[12:24] <maswan> yeah, we know it isn't in P, since we have a bunch of P servers that would like it. :)
[12:25]  * apw concurs
[12:26] <henrix> maswan: could you please open a bug with this and paste here the bug #? i'll follow up with this
[12:27] <maswan> henrix: Yeah, dusting off my launchpad:ese now. :)
[12:27] <maswan> Hm. A possible option for us would also be an r-to-p kernel backport in the wait for a new lts, I guess, assuming it works.
[12:28] <henrix> maswan: r on p is also possible, yes
[12:29] <maswan> But if there is a major kernel update scheduled for P anyway, this is a change that I'd very much would like to be considered for it
[12:31] <henrix> this change would be included in the regular SRU cycles, not really in a major kernel update
[12:32]  * maswan nods
[12:39] <maswan> henrix: 1111416
[12:41] <henrix> maswan: ack, thanks. i'll make sure we'll have this option enabled soon
[12:43]  * henrix -> lunch
[12:48] <maswan> awesome!

[14:09] <apw> bug #1111416
[14:09] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1111416 in linux (Ubuntu Quantal) "CONFIG_NFS_V4_1=y in Precise kernel update, please" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1111416
[14:10] <apw> maswan, when you roll custom kernels is all you are changing from the main P kernel that option?  and if so and you have tested or even production run with that it would be good infrmation to have in the bug
[14:11] <apw> it all helps to tell us it is stable and feature complete back there
[14:14] <maswan> apw: We haven't yet, we're just deploying the new storage now. Will prod the guys in charge of that project to do that and test it proper.
[14:14] <apw> maswan, or get henrix to post an 'official' test kernel with the changes he intends to apply 
[14:14] <maswan> apw: that would be even better
[14:15] <henrix> apw: maswan: will do that. i'll post a link in the bug to Q and P test kernels before submitting the patches
[14:15] <maswan> henrix: excellent!
[15:41] <apw> ppisati, i have been running your -omap kernel on omap4, and i think it just wedged
[15:41] <apw> ppisati, seen anything like that?
[15:42] <ppisati> apw: uhm no
[15:42] <ppisati> apw: did it print anything?
[15:42] <apw> ppisati, also i seem to have lost my heartbeat
[15:42] <apw> ppisati, not anywhere i could see
[15:42] <ppisati> apw: i compiled a kernel oevr usb and it was ok
[15:46] <apw> ppisati, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1593378/
[15:48] <henrix> maswan: i've just updated the bug with an URL to test kernels
[15:50] <ppisati> apw: ok, i saw it in the past
[15:52] <apw> ppisati, so did you say there was a bug open on this one ?
[15:52] <apw> ppisati, i am probabally pretty rare in actually having ipv6 to trigger this
[15:53] <maswan> henrix: thank you, we'll see if we can get some testing done tomorrow, or next week.
[15:53] <apw> ppisati, if that is the actual cause of course
[15:53] <apw> ppisati, anyhow i have also lost my heartbeat on that box, is that gone in 3.8
[15:53] <henrix> maswan: sure, no prob. just update the bug with any info, as i'll keep an eye on it
[15:54] <ppisati> apw: led? probably config skew
[15:54] <apw> ppisati, yeah the flash-flash  flash-flash  related to load thing
[15:54] <ppisati> apw: there's a but about a slowpath being hit, and the reporter said the board was both ipv4/6 connected
[15:54] <apw> ppisati, now i have no lights when it is idle, which is

[15:54] <apw> not what i am used to
[15:55] <ppisati> apw: ok, i'll turn heartbeat on
[15:55]  * ppisati has used more the imx6 lately
[15:55] <ppisati> that's why i probably didn't notice it
[15:56] <apw> ppisati, that bug looks different to me, here is a real BUG
[15:56] <ppisati> apw: yes, it's different
[15:56] <ppisati> apw: but i think i saw it
[15:57] <ppisati> apw: apw and it didn't hangs my board
[15:57] <apw> it is hard to know whether it was the last thing, as the log is truncated at that point
[15:57] <ppisati> apw: ok
[15:57] <ppisati> i'll push 2 patches for imx6, then i'll switch back to see this on omap4
[16:03] <apw>  ppisati np thanks
[16:03] <apw> ppisati, i'll monitor it for a bit to see if it does it again

[17:35] <arges> anybody getting 'fail to flush all tx fifo queues' with 3.8.0-2 on their centrino intel w/ iwlwifi driver?
[17:36] <henrix> arges: yeah, i've seen it as well. but it should be fixed with c3e5d7181afb66657393066bccce0956fab09ab3
[17:37] <arges> henrix: ok so that's in the next raring kernel?
[17:37] <henrix> (haven't tested it myself as i rarely use wifi)
[17:37] <arges> 3.8.0-3?
[17:38] <henrix> arges: i guess so, its mainlined
[17:39] <henrix> arges: here's the lkml thread i recently saw: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/1/28/603
[17:41] <ogasawara> arges: I don't think we have it just yet in raring, but I'll cherry-pick it for now
[17:41] <arges> ogasawara: or I can do it. either way : )
[17:41] <ogasawara> arges: meh, easy enough for me.  I'll let you build your own kernel though.  we just missed the upload this morning.
[17:42] <arges> ogasawara: ok
[17:43] <henrix> arges: ogasawara: note that i haven't tested it myself -- i just saw this thread in lkml, which caught my attention because i hit the same issue during weekend
[17:44] <henrix> (and completely forgot about it until arges remind me about it :-) )
[17:44] <arges> well i can test 
[17:44] <ogasawara> arges: so maybe let me know how your test goes first and then I'll cherry-pick it
[17:44] <arges> ogasawara: ack
[17:44] <arges> should i file a new bug to track this btw?
[17:45] <ogasawara> arges: nah, since it's the dev release we can be a little more lenient with the process
[17:45] <arges> ok great. baking a new kernel...
[17:45] <ogasawara> arges: plus we'll eventually pick it up whenever -rc6 goes out and we rebase

[18:58] <apw> ppisati, yep, we've been trying to get fixes for that out for months
[18:58] <apw> ppisati, ultimatly it is terrible firmware which loses its mind
[19:07] <apw> ppisati, how do the dtbs get supplied to the kernel for the omap3/4 use ?
[19:07] <ppisati> apw: we don't use them in panda&c yet
[19:07] <ppisati> apw: if you want to use it, you need to manually copy to the fat partition
[19:08] <apw> ppisati, so how does the kernel know it is for omap3/4 and adapt without the dtb
[19:08] <ppisati> apw: and then modifiy uEnv.txt to load it
[19:08] <apw> i thought the point was it used the dtb to know what it was on
[19:09] <infinity> ppisati: What Andy's asking isn't "how do I use a dtb on Panda", but "how does the kernel know it's booting on a Panda"?
[19:09] <ppisati> apw: arm/arch/mach-omap/boards* file are still compiled in
[19:09] <infinity> ppisati: And if the answer is "it's build to assume it's on OMAP", that could explain why we can't make it work on vexpress.
[19:09] <apw> ppisati, yeah i have been trying to boot the same kenrel on vexpress and its not having it for me at least, dispite appearing to be enabled
[19:10] <apw> ppisati, even supplying a dt
[19:10] <apw> dtb to qemu ...
[19:10] <ppisati> apw: let me try
[19:10] <apw> ppisati, thanks
[19:16] <ppisati> apw: ah, maybe i know what's going on
[19:17] <ppisati> apw: i think they are attaching the DTB at the end of the kernel
[19:17] <ppisati> apw: so you don't see they are passing it
[19:17] <ppisati> apw: and of course we can't do it
[19:18] <apw> so you mean i would need to add the dtb to vmlinux for it to work
[19:18] <apw> vmlinuz even
[19:18] <apw> even in qemu with -dtb support
[19:20] <apw> ppisati, can i leave you to try and figure out if it can be done manually
[19:20] <apw> ppisati, so we can later figure out what one has to do to make it work right
[19:25] <ppisati> apw: yep
[19:25] <apw> thanks
