[09:55] <YoBoY> hi
=== rbecker is now known as RBecker
=== RBecker is now known as rbecker
[15:16] <OZUNU> i got a question
[15:18] <OZUNU> is there anybpdy to help me?
[15:18] <OZUNU> is there anybody to help me?
[15:19] <JanC> OZUNU: what do you need help with?
[15:23] <OZUNU> thanks, i am from costa rica and i have been searching for a loco team to support but i could not find any here so 
[15:24] <OZUNU> i wanna know how i can help to others teams like this...
[15:25] <JanC> You can start a Costa-Rican locoteam yourself  ☺
[15:27] <OZUNU> which are the requirements i need to create one?
[15:28] <JanC> and there is of course also the Spanish language community (Spanish language forums, etc.)
[15:29] <JanC> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamHowto
[15:31] <OZUNU> is my english too bad?
[15:32] <JanC> OZUNU: your English seems okay to me
[15:32] <OZUNU> lol thanks
[15:32] <OZUNU> and tell me something
[15:32] <OZUNU> what the loco teams do?
[15:33] <JanC> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoTeamHowto#Things_your_LoCo_can_do  ☺
[15:34] <JanC> for example, we will have a booth at an open source developer conference next weekend
[15:39] <OZUNU> but who are the developers or how is it?
[15:41] <JanC> FOSDEM http://fosdem.org/ is a general open source developer conference, with developers from all over the world coming to Brussels, and we do the Ubuntu booth there (there will also be Ubuntu developers & contributors elsewhere at the conference, of course)
[15:42] <JanC> but something like that probably doesn't exist (yet) in Costa Rica?
[15:42] <JanC> you can do promotion of Ubuntu in other places
[15:42] <JanC> we did it at computer sales fairs and other places
[15:43] <OZUNU> here we dont have something like that, my idea is to show to everybody in here that free software is wonderful
[15:43] <OZUNU> and show them ubuntu 
[15:43] <OZUNU> how it works and how this OS improve our lives
[15:43] <JanC> or you can just go to the local market and show the people who come to the market
[15:44] <JanC> or you can try to convince the local press to write about it
[15:45] <JanC> there are some other ideas on the wiki page I referred to
[15:45] <OZUNU> i fix computers and things like that and y try to make people use ubuntu but this has been difficult because noone want to leave microsoft
[15:45] <OZUNU> that is why i want to

[15:49] <JanC> OZUNU: I think the first thing to do is probably to find some people who can help you, and try to find a way to make Ubuntu better known in Costa Rica
[15:49] <JanC> maybe some students or so
[15:49] <OZUNU> that is why i want to make loco team
[15:52] <OZUNU> i will do so, i will look for some people to help me with my idea.
[15:52] <JanC> OZUNU: maybe the people from #gulcr can help?
[15:53] <JanC> and maybe there are Mozilla / LibreOffice groups in Costa Rica too
[15:55] <JanC> hm, apparently, there already is a Costa Rica locoteam?
[15:55] <JanC> or was?

[15:56] <JanC> #ubuntu-centroamerica doesn't seem too active though...   :-(
[16:00] <JanC> OZUNU: seems like https://launchpad.net/~elopio works for Canonical and is from Costa Rica

[16:06] <OZUNU> send me the link please of the team you found
