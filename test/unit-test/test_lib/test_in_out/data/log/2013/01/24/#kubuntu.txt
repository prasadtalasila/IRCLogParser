[00:14] <Secris> I changed the theme to Zion (reversed) and kate is still showing black text
[00:16] <Torch> Secris: you mean why do the colours in kate not change with the global colour theme?
[00:16] <Secris> basically
[00:16] <Torch> Secris: if that is indeed the question, the answer is that kate has its own colour schemes
[00:18] <Secris> So I will need to get more color schemes?
[00:19] <Torch> Secris: just set the colour scheme in kate the way you want it

[13:51] <doctorpepper> hi guys!!!
[14:04] <doctorpepper> can anyone help me please, i am using ktorrent with a proxy and  it seems that ktorrent ignores completly the proxy settings
[14:10] <invariant> doctorpepper, I recommend you do the proxy part via some other tool.
[14:10] <invariant> doctorpepper, that way you know that kproxy doesn't need to have that logic.
[14:10] <invariant> doctorpepper, and if you use some well tested tool, you are less likely to have any issues.
[14:11] <doctorpepper> actually the same setup used to work 6 months ago
[14:14] <invariant> doctorpepper, I am not saying that it didn't.
[14:14] <invariant> doctorpepper, I am just saying that if something doesn't work, working around it by using more proven tools is a viable strategy.

[17:29] <odo2063> Hi!
[17:29] <lordievader> odo2063: Hey
[17:31] <odo2063> yesterday i update from 11.10 over 12.04 to 12.10, but now i can't control my backlight brightness on my lenovo s205(AMD) anymore(specialkeys for sound do work). and i can control brightness at "boottime"
[17:31] <odo2063> does somebody has an idea?
[17:32] <lordievader> odo2063: Check if the gfx driver is properly installed.
[17:32] <odo2063> checked/installed twice with jockey
[17:33] <odo2063> strange...that seems not right...
[17:33] <lordievader> odo2063: Is the driver also in use?
[17:35] <odo2063> lets get back to the driver install. there are to points "ATI Fire GL" and "Video driver for the AMD...". and i installed the second, but it tells me that i have installed the first one
[17:35] <disharmonic> Evening
[17:35] <lordievader> Hey disharmonic
[17:36] <odo2063> hi
[17:36] <lordievader> odo2063: Does it give more information? (Fglrx/radeon?)
[17:37] <odo2063> no
[17:37] <odo2063> fglrx is loaded
[17:38] <odo2063> and i have "dirct rendering" and cubes :-)
[17:39] <MichaelP> Going to take windows of my Harddrive.. But i have 12.10 setup the way i want it with qtcurve styles and themes and all that.. What do i need to my a livecd of my system.. Or back all that up so i dont loose it ?
[17:40] <disharmonic> Muon doesnt auto-request kdesu?
[17:40] <lordievader> odo2063: So to get things straight, amdcccle does not complain... Can you change the brightness thorugh the powersettings in the System Settings program?
[17:40] <lordievader> MichaelP: How did you install (K)ubuntu?
[17:40] <MichaelP> Live usb
[17:41] <odo2063> lordievader,  there is no amdccle
[17:43] <lordievader> odo2063: Ahh that probably explains it :), strange though that the jockey reports that it is installed. Try reinstalling the fglrx driver.
[17:43] <MichaelP> normaly amdccle is start menu setting... amd catalyst control center
[17:44] <lordievader> MichaelP: Ok, then it should suffice to simply remove the Windows partition and update the Grub config. However it is allways a good idea to back up sensitive data before doing a major hard-disk operation.
[17:44] <odo2063> lordievader,  doing so with synaptic
[17:44] <lordievader> odo2063: Oh btw, can the terminal not find amdcccle? Or isn't it in the startmenu?
[17:45] <lordievader> odo2063: Jockey is a better option, imo.
[17:45] <disharmonic> Jockey is unreliable
[17:45] <lordievader> disharmonic: Not to me...
[17:46] <lordievader> Jockey-text anyhow.
[17:46] <odo2063> lordievader,  startmenu has it
[17:46] <odo2063> lordievader,  but powersettings does nothing
[17:46] <lordievader> odo2063: Hold on whay do you mean? Is the Amd control center in the start menu?
[17:47] <BluesKaj> odo2063, run glxinfo | grep OpenGL to make sure the driver is loaded , it shows up beside "OpenGL version string"
[17:47] <disharmonic> lordievader, well my experience was so positive i now d/l the driver from AMD and generate debs with the buildpkg option ;)
[17:47] <odo2063> lordievader,  OpenGL vendor string: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.
[17:48] <lordievader> disharmonic: The downside of a manual install is that it usually breaks when you update the kernel, well that's my experience.
[17:48] <MichaelP> lordievader, sence windows 7 and 8 makes that little boot partition.. does linux boot record go to that or mbr
[17:49] <BluesKaj> odo2063,  the OpenGL version string, not vendor
[17:49] <odo2063> OpenGL version string: 4.2.11903 Compatibility Profile Context
[17:50] <lordievader> MichaelP: Hmm good question, I must say I do not know. I suspect Grub is still in the mbr, since that is the section the bios reads when bootstrapping to OS.
[17:50] <mandoguit> fwiw...  if you type    inxi -Gx    that information as well as video driver etc is displayed
[17:51] <lordievader> Or fglrxinfo, in this case.
[17:51] <disharmonic> lordievader, yeah. I always reinstall if the kernel gets updated, just to be sure.
[17:52] <odo2063> inxi -Gx
[17:52] <lordievader> disharmonic: I grew tired of that, so I started using the jockey, works fine for me.
[17:52] <mandoguit> odo2063:   in terminal
[17:52] <disharmonic> Regarding the Muon question. Shouldn't Muon ask for priviliges when clicking on install rather than displaying an error?
[17:52] <BluesKaj> yes
[17:52] <odo2063> mandoguit,  command not found
[17:53] <MichaelP> does ubuntu have anything to make livecd of the installed system... Like in PcLinuxOS when i used that years ago... i used MkLivecd
[17:53] <mandoguit> odo2063:    hmmm.....might have to install it then.   nice little utility to have on hand as it displays tons of info regarding ones system
[17:54] <MichaelP> i found what im looking for https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization
[17:54] <nandhu> this will work out easily you can do a chroot to the live cd environment alter your linux and make it ready again
[17:55] <nandhu> LiveCDCustomization
[17:55] <odo2063> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566720/   <-- fglrxinfo
[17:57] <mandoguit> odo2063:   http://code.google.com/p/inxi/        seems it's not included in the default k/ubuntu installs as it is in other distro's.    worth a look at imho
[17:57] <odo2063> mandoguit,  maybe not today ;-)
[17:58] <lordievader> odo2063: Can you paste bin the output of: sudo jockey-text -l
[18:00] <odo2063> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566720/
[18:00] <odo2063> kmod:fglrx - ATI Fire GL (Proprietary, Enabled, In use)
[18:01] <disharmonic> lordievader, i never managed to enable the updates stream personally. I've seen others with the same issue. It does work as it should for many ppl though
[18:01] <odo2063> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566733/
[18:01] <MichaelP> So for LiveCDCustomization i need to have the kubuntu iso i take it... Sence it says choose ISO image that will be used for the base... im installed kubuntu... but i have ubuntu iso in my usb harddrive... or should i redown kubuntu iso?
[18:02] <lordievader> disharmonic: Had many issues with that too, but in 12.10 it worked to my surprise.
[18:02] <FlowRiser> odo2063, i have an Ati card; what i do after every installation of ubuntu; i install fglrx through: sudo apt-get install fglrx
[18:02]  * odo2063 is back in 5min
[18:02] <lordievader> MichaelP: Why do you want to make a LiveCd?
[18:02] <disharmonic> lordievader, well i'm on 12.04 ;)
[18:02] <odo2063> MichaelP,  mint has actual a nice tool in its repo
[18:03] <lordievader> odo2063: Hmm seems the fglrx driver is installed, however I'd try to reinstall the driver through the jockey.
[18:03] <MichaelP> To have a compleate backup of my system
[18:03] <lordievader> disharmonic: I had the same problem in 12.04.
[18:04] <MichaelP> odo2063, whats in there repo
[18:04] <lordievader> MichaelP: A better way would be to get an external drive, or burn the files to a dvd.
[18:06] <MichaelP> lordievader, what my ./kde/share/apps
[18:08] <lordievader> MichaelP: I'd say /home, this contains all the user's files and user's config files. And perhaps a few things out of /etc (system-wide config files).

[18:14] <odo2063> nothing new
[18:15] <lordievader> mohamare: Check out: http://kde-look.org/
[18:15] <odo2063> so any other options instead of a new installation?
[18:17] <lordievader> odo2063: I take it, it didn't work?
[18:17] <odo2063> lordievader,  exactly
[18:20] <lordievader> odo2063: Hmm, bummer. You could try a manual install... Means: removing the driver through the jockey. Downloading the driver from AMD and manually installing that one.
[18:22] <odo2063> lordievader,  yeah may...u know...it's not an option for me ;-) (not that i not can)
[18:23] <lordievader> odo2063: What do you mean? Why not?
[18:24] <mohamare> no parsian in this room?
[18:24] <odo2063> lordievader,  i just take the new intall then...
[18:24] <lordievader> odo2063: Then you will be left with the radeon driver...
[18:24] <lordievader> Would be the same if you simply removed the fglrx driver, radeon is fallback.. should be in any case.
[18:24] <odo2063> lordievader,  y?
[18:25] <lordievader> odo2063: But why is a manual install no option?
[18:26] <odo2063> lordievader,  i just dont want to! :-)
[18:27] <lordievader> odo2063: Well you could try and see if the radeon driver supports the backlight brightness control. I know it never did for me, but perhaps for your card it does.

[18:51] <invariant> lordievader, since when are those things even remotely related?
[19:04] <lordievader> invariant: Brightness control and gfx drivers you mean?
[19:04] <invariant> lordievader, yes
[19:05] <invariant> lordievader, because I haven't ever seen a device where they are related.
[19:05] <lordievader> invariant: I had the same problem once with my laptop, the fix was installing the gfx driver.
[19:06] <invariant> lordievader, very unlikely.
[19:06] <invariant> lordievader, you might think that was the solution.
[19:06] <invariant> lordievader, backlights are not controlled by graphics cards.
[19:06] <lordievader> invariant: Perhaps, it seemed so at the time.
[19:07] <lordievader> invariant: I see, then do you have a suggestion for odo2063 how he can fix his problem?
[19:08] <invariant> lordievader, check for platform support in the linux kernel for his device.
[19:09] <invariant> lordievader, if there is no such support, it's never going to work.
[19:09] <invariant> lordievader, (unless he wants to reverse-engineer the windows drivers)
[19:09] <odo2063> lordievader,  i had the idea that it might be something with the groups
[19:09] <invariant> lordievader, my answer is the only correct answer.
[19:10] <invariant> This is why you first check whether your hardware is supported with platform drivers before buying it.
[19:10] <invariant> Supported hardware is more expensive, but will save you a ton of headaches.
[19:11] <lordievader> odo2063: Has the brightness control worked before?
[19:12] <odo2063> lordievader,  in 11.10 yes
[19:12] <odo2063> and with with any 12.10 live-image
[19:16] <lordievader> odo2063: Since when did it stop working? After an update or something?
[19:17] <odo2063> exactly. i did yesterday the big run from 11.10 over 12.04 to 12.10
[19:18] <lordievader> odo2063: Hmm perhaps simply reinstalling 12.10 is the easiest...
[19:18] <odo2063> :-) i think i said something like that :-P

[20:07] <designbybeck> Greetings all, I have Kubuntu 12.10 installed on a computer that is being donated for a public access area for students. I'd like to let them login with Guest, but I want them to have a preset desktop with widgets and such ready to go. Can I do this?
[20:08] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: yes you can
=== sysadmin is now known as Guest3568
[20:09] <designbybeck> EagleScreen: might you point me in the directoin to set that up? I already have the main login set the way I want with widgets and background, how do I make this the default for the Guest everytime someone logs in
[20:10] <disharmonic> KDE does look sweet. Provided you take the time to set it up. Most distros have it looking really bland though
[20:11] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: making script that changes configuration on the fly, and make a plasma restart, OR using a different account than guest and using it as the guest account (i think this method is easier)
[20:12] <designbybeck> hmmm, so i can make a "randomuser" and set everything up on that "randomuser" account, and then make it a member of "guest"? EagleScreen is that how?
[20:14] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: why is your main reason to use guest account? autoremove of all files?
[20:14] <designbybeck> for the most part EagleScreen
[20:16] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: I think the easiest way is: 1) create a normal user, 2) use nodm instead if kdm (or lightdm, 3) clear that user password if you want, 4) make some script which clear previous sessions files at login
[20:16] <designbybeck> EagleScreen:  It is for mainly physics and computer science students. I want them to be able to use all the software I have installed on it
=== nmmm is now known as nmmm-away
[20:17] <disharmonic> Hmm, how do i set up virtual desktops? It used to be under the Desktop tab iirc, but i don't see that one anymore
[20:18] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: if you use nodm instead of lightdm, users can login with no password, and custom desktop configuration done by you will be persistent
[20:18] <disharmonic> nvm, foud it
[20:18] <designbybeck> not sure how to make those scripts and such EagleScreen
[20:19] <designbybeck> I guess other than the Widget setup I really don't care that they use Guest... Was just hoping to have some of the converter, calculator, weather widgets open when they first started up
[20:21] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: any dude?
[20:22] <designbybeck> no I'm not a programmer sorry
[20:23] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: can't you make a bash script?
[20:23] <designbybeck> no clue
[20:24] <designbybeck> !#
[20:24] <designbybeck> lol something like that in a text file
[20:24] <EagleScreen> let me see other alternatives..
[20:29] <designbybeck> EagleScreen: with UbuntuTweak you can change a few login details on Ubuntu, was hoping for something that easy
[20:35] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: i am looking for it
[20:46] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: the key is in /etc/guest-session/skel I think
[20:46] <designbybeck> ah yes, I remember reading something about that for the Ubuntu setup I did
[20:46] <designbybeck> it was something along the lines as you get one sessions setup how you want it, copy something and put it in /guest-session/skel
[20:47] <designbybeck> I just didn't run across Kubuntu and Activities/Widgets and didn't know if it would work the same

[21:37] <designbybeck> what system you running EagleScreen?
=== paolo is now known as faLUCE
[22:09] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: on Kubuntu 12.10 that directory is not present
[22:10] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: as consequence, I only have an idea of doing it with a user different than guest, which you could use like the guest account
[22:22] <designbybeck> I am seeing that myself EagleScreen
[22:23] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: have got that directory in your system?
[22:24] <designbybeck> no I do not EagleScreen I meant I see that it isn't there on Kubuntu or my Ubuntu setup
[22:24] <EagleScreen> ok
[22:25] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: use a normal user, you can create it with graphical tools or with command: sudo adduser charlie
[22:25] <EagleScreen> where charlie is the username you want
[22:26] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: you can deactivate his password with: sudo passwd -d charlie
[22:26] <EagleScreen> then everybody can login with it
[22:26] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: you also can install nodm if you do not want login screen neither (auto login without login screen)
[22:27] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: then you can customize the desktop as you like, and it will be persistent
[22:27] <designbybeck> I think there is a setting in Kubuntu that will turn off the password for the login
[22:28] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: may be
[22:28] <designbybeck> Will it roll back if another students changes something or turns off a widget EagleScreen ?
[22:29] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: we can do something to estore back the default (customized) desktop each time a session is started, so yes
[22:31] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: first create a new user and custimize the desktop as you want there. Ae you going to do it right now?
[22:32] <designbybeck> EagleScreen:  I just found under System Settings Start up and SHutdown under Session Management area
[22:32] <designbybeck> It has On Login area... wonder if that might help
[22:34] <EagleScreen> we can use it later to run things at login
[22:36] <designbybeck> but it says you can reload a saved session, wonder where you save it in the first place is EagleScreen
[22:41] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: that has nothing to do regarding you want
[22:46] <designbybeck> no?
[22:49] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: no
[22:50] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: have you already created a a normal (not admin) user account and customized it?
[22:55] <designbybeck> yes just did that EagleScreen
[22:55] <designbybeck> got it pretty much how the other one was
[22:56] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: now login with the other (admin) account
[22:56] <designbybeck> ok

[23:07] <EagleScreen> designbybeck: copy recursively and keep file permisions (like buckup)
[23:07] <designbybeck> ah ok, that is done now
[23:10] <EagleScreen> now copy hiden and config files: cp -a /home/physics/.* /opt/physics_skel
[23:11] <designbybeck> gave some errors saying it would not create hard link to ... file. I am guessing that is correct because we want it to stay pointing to the same absolute path correct EagleScreen
[23:12] <EagleScreen> yes
[23:12] <EagleScreen> dont worry
[23:12] <designbybeck> ok that is done
[23:12] <EagleScreen> now you have a backup of that user settings in that directory
