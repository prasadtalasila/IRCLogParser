[05:08] <barrydk> Good morning all
[05:10] <barrydk> Good morning Maaz
[05:45] <superfly> hi barrydk 
[05:48] <barrydk> Ah there is life Morning Superfly
[05:49] <superfly> barrydk: yup, just on the train at the moment... was chatting with a friend up till now 
[05:50] <barrydk> Ok is it the Gau
[06:00] <superfly> no, it's the metro
[06:03] <barrydk> Ok 
[06:17] <superfly> barrydk: I don't live near the Gau... it would take a few days drive to get there
[06:18] <barrydk> where are you Superfly
[06:20] <superfly> barrydk: where do you think?
[06:20] <barrydk> No idea 
[06:21] <Kilos> morning superfly barrydk and others
[06:22] <barrydk> If it's a few days to get to the Gau then it must be higgher  up in Africa but i don't know if they have metro.
[06:22] <barrydk> Morning Kilos
[06:23] <superfly> morning Kilos
[06:33] <superfly> evidently the only place in South Africa that people live in is Gauteng
[06:34] <Kilos> thats a strange statement
[06:34] <Kilos> what i missed
[06:36] <barrydk> Im trying to guess where Superfly live. He said it would take him a few days drive to get to gauteng as he is using the metro train. So either he is driving an oxwaggon or he doesnt live in Sa but i dont know if they have metro in Africa
[06:37] <Kilos> lol
[06:40] <Kilos> barrydk, you have a car?
[06:42] <barrydk> Yes Kilos
[06:42] <Kilos> what car barrydk ?
[06:42] <barrydk> Ford Saphire and a Toyota Hilux
[06:43] <Kilos> ok 15 hours drive going fast with only petrol and pee stops
[06:44] <Kilos> more than speed limit fast
[06:44] <barrydk> And i can get to annywhere in SA within a few days.
[06:45] <Kilos> yip 
[06:45] <barrydk> So Superfly is in the Cape and drive an oxwaggon when he's not using the metro.
[06:51] <Kilos> lol
[06:52] <Kilos> oxwagon would take weeks or months
[06:52] <superfly> barrydk: I needed to drive the oxwagon so that you could catch up to me :-P
[06:52] <Kilos> hahaha
[06:53] <Kilos> fulla beens today
[06:53] <Kilos> beans too
[06:53] <barrydk> a car would only take a day not a few days.
[06:54] <superfly> barrydk: sure, if you drive like a maniac
[06:54] <barrydk> Are yoy close to the see Superfly
[06:55] <Kilos> superfly, in  sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces to add nameserver 8.8.8.8 8.8.8.4 must there be a , after 8.8.8.8
[06:56] <superfly> barrydk: 3 things: (a) my nick is "superfly" not "Superfly", (b) it is "you", not "yoy" and (c) it is "sea", not "see"
[06:56] <superfly> and to answer you unasked question, Yes, I am always this grumpy
[06:57] <superfly> Kilos: no
[06:57] <superfly> Kilos: not as far as I know
[06:57] <Kilos> ty superfly 
[06:57] <inetpro> superfly grumpy? Never!
[06:57] <superfly> barrydk: Yes, I am close to the sea. It wouldn't be Cape Town if I was far from it
[06:57] <inetpro> good mornings

[06:58] <Kilos> lo inetpro 
[06:58] <inetpro> ehlo Kilos
[07:03] <barrydk> superfly: 1.I was tought a name starts with a capital letter, but if you prefer superfly to Superfly it is fine. 2 and 3. My spelling is much better in afrikaans  and for the grumpy part get some coffee. It is such a lovely morning i have to pull someones leg. I'm also grumpy now cause i mis the sea.
[07:03] <superfly> barrydk: coffee only enhances the grumpiness
[07:06] <inetpro> barrydk: just use the tab
[07:06] <Kilos> barrydk, you are using xchat right?
[07:07] <Kilos> type the first 3 letters of a nick and use tab
[07:07] <inetpro> barrydk: after typing Sup just press tab and it will complete superfly
[07:07] <barrydk> to do what inetpro. Yes kilos. Ok
[07:08] <Kilos> then you never need to use caps the tab will sort it if nick starts with a capital letter
[07:08] <inetpro> did somebody mention coffee?

[07:57] <mazal> Morning all
[07:57] <mazal> Can someone help me please
[07:57] <magespawn> hey mazal
[07:57] <superfly> hi mazal
[07:57] <mazal> How can I export my database list to a txt document ?
[07:58] <mazal> I know how to get my database list inside mysql , but how to export that list ?
[07:58] <superfly> mazal: ah, mysql
[07:58] <superfly> mazal: first present the facts, then ask your question
[07:58] <mazal> I tried "show databses > /home/username/filename.txt
[07:58] <mazal> Without the "
[07:59] <superfly> mazal: you using the mysql command line client?
[07:59] <mazal> Correct
[07:59] <superfly> it's not bash
[07:59] <mazal> All I want is the name of my databases in a txt file
[07:59] <superfly> mazal: copy and paste :-P
[08:00] <mazal> Can't
[08:00] <mazal> I'm in puty
[08:00] <superfly> mazal: you can, even on PuTTY
[08:00] <mazal> Right-click don't work and ctrl-C aborts the mysql session
[08:01] <superfly> mazal: as soon as you've selected in PuTTY, it is copied into your clipboard
[08:01] <mazal> I just select ?
[08:01] <superfly> yuhuh
[08:03] <mazal> Wow , ok , is it putty that is so cool ?
[08:03] <magespawn> i did not know that either
[08:04] <Kilos> hi Vince-0 theblazehen 
[08:04] <mazal> Wow , so everything I select is automatically copied. This is a nice trick man !!!
[08:05] <superfly> mazal: it's just copying Linux
[08:05] <Vince-0> Hi!
[08:05] <mazal> Ok , so I have my smb.conf , crontab.txt , userlist.txt , databaselist.txt , backup sh files
[08:05] <mazal> What else would I need to redo server
[08:06] <mazal> Oh and the data itself I do have of course
[08:06] <superfly> hi Vince-0
[08:07] <superfly> mazal: /etc, /var/lib or so, home directories maybe
[08:07] <mazal> All home folders I will backup
[08:08] <mazal> I have no special mounts so fstab backup not needed
[08:08] <mazal> hmm , I can't think of anything else
[08:10] <mazal> Databases will be backed up to .sql files
[08:10]  * mazal thinks of anything else
[08:10] <mazal> Hi Vince-0 
[08:17] <theblazehen> hi kilos
[08:21] <magespawn> hey theblazehen
[08:23] <theblazehen> hi magespawn
[08:40] <Kilos> hmm
[08:44] <magespawn> peer got you Kilos
[08:44] <Kilos> hehe some ifconfig killed me
[08:45] <Kilos> nm couldnt connect again
[08:45] <Kilos> so pulled a windows trick
[08:48] <magespawn> restart
[08:53] <Kilos> yip
[08:56] <Kilos> i hate following instructions from the net
[08:56] <Kilos> some work and others kill me
[09:00] <mazal_> barrydk, amper klaar , brand nou die iso
[09:00] <barrydk> reg so
[09:00] <mazal_> Wish us luck guys , we about to redo our main production server :P
[09:01] <Kilos> good luck you two
[09:01] <barrydk> Good luck Mazal
[09:01] <mazal_> lol
[09:01] <mazal_> Why couldn't I think if this last wekk !!!! ai
[09:03] <mazal_> I don't suppose there's a way to transfer all user accounts hey guys ? Will have to re-create them all ?
[09:04] <Kilos> wont a backup remember them?
[09:04] <Kilos> or cp everything
[09:04] <mazal_> That's the data , I'm talking about the accounts themselves
[09:04] <Kilos> they must be saved somewhere
[09:04] <Kilos> save that file too
[09:05] <superfly> Kilos: that's why you never believe anything that is written on the Internet, especially by Ubuntu users
[09:05] <Kilos> superfly, i try not to bother you guys more than is necessary
[09:06] <Kilos> often its to fix what ive broken from following the net stuff
[09:08] <mazal_> Ok ek's oppad barrydk 
=== magespawn_ is now known as magespawn
[09:15] <magespawn> there are a couple of sites that i use that are fairly reliable
[09:16] <magespawn> but i also cross reference a lot
[09:18] <Kilos> whatever killed my pc the other day killed my server as well
[09:18] <Kilos> cant boot today
[09:18] <Kilos> grrr
[09:20] <magespawn> wonder what it was
[09:21] <Kilos> i dunno just glad it didnt kill you too
[09:21] <Kilos> server is a major job without internet
[09:22] <Kilos> and i didnt save where it must find sticks etc
[09:22] <Kilos> grrr
[09:22] <Kilos> remember had to mkdir /media/external
[09:24] <Kilos> maybe ill first try boot-repair from maverick
[09:25] <Kilos> oh 
[09:25] <Kilos> eish
[09:39] <Kilos> dont think it will work because i wont be able then to boot from server and run boot-repair
[09:39] <Kilos> sigh
[09:44] <Kilos> yay it booted
[09:44] <Kilos> yoohoo
[09:48] <magespawn> cool Kilos
[09:49] <Kilos> maybe i should install boot-repair on it
[09:49] <Kilos> from here
[09:49] <Kilos> hehe
[09:49] <Kilos> i like ssh
[09:49] <magespawn> does boot-repair work without a gui
[09:49] <magespawn> ssh is pretty cool hey
[09:50] <magespawn> now you can use sftp to move files securely too
[09:50] <Kilos> you can start it from cli but it opens a small window so i dunno
[09:50] <Kilos> sftp?
[09:50] <Kilos> file transfer process?
[09:50] <Kilos> secure?
[09:51] <Kilos> Maaz, define sftp
[09:51] <Maaz> Kilos: SFTP Screened Foiled Twisted Pair [cable] (UTP, TP) , SFTP Simple File Transfer Protocol (RFC 913)
[09:51] <Kilos> ah Simple File Transfer Protocol
[09:51] <Kilos> i like simple
[09:52] <magespawn> actually i thin it is secure file transfer protocol
[09:53] <magespawn> s/thin/think
[09:53] <Kilos> this is a bad unity install text in pidgin is so tiny and i cant change it
[09:53] <Kilos> grrr even with myunity
[09:56] <magespawn> at the moment i do not have unity on any of my machines so have no idea
[09:56] <Kilos> hehe
[10:15] <Kilos> happy new year cocooncrash 
[10:16] <superfly> scp is slightly better than sftp if you just want to copy files without running a file manager
[10:17] <Kilos> does one install file managers on a server or just do things via cli
[10:36] <magedroid> hey second power cut for today
[10:36] <Kilos> yeah ugly
[10:37] <magedroid> just annoying.
[10:37] <Kilos> not if you upgrading
[10:38] <magedroid> was busy repiaring a pc, factory reinstall
[10:38] <Kilos> then i becomes a hassle
[10:38] <Kilos> ai
[10:39] <magedroid> yup
[10:39] <magedroid> so we sit instead
[10:46] <mazal> Can someone help me with an ssh problem please. From a linux pc I can ssh into the server , but from my Win 7 pc with putty I just get the error "Server unexpectedly closed connection"
[10:46] <mazal> Unable to connect with putty at all
[10:53] <magedroid> mazal are they on the same network?
[10:53] <mazal> Yep magedroid 
[10:53] <mazal> Same lan
[10:54] <magedroid> do you enter the username and password as you log in or are they saved in putty?
[10:54] <mazal> It doesn't even get that far to ask for username , doesn't connect at all
[10:54] <magedroid> maybe the ssh config resticts the login, but not sure how
[10:56] <mazal> Only happens from putty on the win box
[10:56] <mazal> Linux box can connect
[10:56] <magedroid> strange
[10:57] <superfly> Kilos: no, SFTP is a kind of a file manager that copies stuff between your local machine and the remote one
[10:57] <superfly> scp is less complicated, and therefore easier to use
[10:57] <magedroid> thats magedroid for have no idea
[10:57] <mazal> Always something that don't work and have to irritate one
[10:57] <Kilos> ah ty superfly 
[10:57] <superfly> mazal: Win7 firewall settings
[10:58] <magedroid> long time since i used putty, can really remember what i did to get mine to work
[10:58] <mazal> superfly, it's off
[10:58] <magedroid> antivirus firewall?
[10:59] <mazal> And it connects fine to my other two ubuntu servers
[10:59] <mazal> Just the new one that doesn't work
[10:59] <superfly> mazal: correct IP address?
[10:59] <mazal> yep
[10:59] <superfly> mazal: make sure you're not using a domain name or host name when you connect via either
[11:00] <mazal> I always connect via ip
[11:00] <magedroid> rubber duck yourself through the setup
[11:01] <magedroid> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging
[11:02] <magedroid> courtesy of superfly and inetpro i think
[11:04] <superfly> mazal: and are you *sure* your linux box is connecting to the correct server?
[11:04] <mazal> Yes I am superfly 
[11:05] <magedroid> can you ping the server?
[11:06] <mazal> yep
[11:07] <mazal> And open it's web sites
[11:07] <superfly> mazal: on the Win7 box too?
[11:07] <mazal> Yes superfly 
[11:07] <mazal> It's only ssh not working
[11:08] <superfly> sounds like a Windows issue to me
[11:09] <mazal> But why does it connect fine to my other 2 ubuntu servers then ?
[11:14] <superfly> mazal: try flushing the DNS cache maybe? Irunno
[11:22] <mazal> Have now idea how to do that
[11:24] <magedroid> on the windows machine ipconfig /flushdns
[11:27] <magedroid> you could also try trace route from both machines
[11:42] <inetpro> mazal: check the putty Event Log
[11:42] <inetpro> right-click on the PuTTY window title
[11:43] <mazal> I THINK we have resolved it
[11:43] <mazal> But now the whole server crashed
[11:43] <mazal> We have added our 2 pc's in the /etc/hosts file
[11:43] <mazal> Then Barry could connect
[11:44] <mazal> But now the server crashed completely
[11:44] <mazal> Will get back to this one
[11:47] <mazal> inetpro, I only get the options "close" and "move" when I click the window
[11:48] <inetpro> hmm...
[11:53] <inetpro> mazal: perhaps you have an old version of putty?
[11:53] <mazal> 0.62
[11:56] <Kilos> whew that Putty is a serious tool hey
[11:56] <Kilos> http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html
[11:57] <mazal> I now have to wait for the huge data copy to finish so I can reboot the server and see if it works now
[11:57] <mazal> Networking has crashed , dunno why , but the data copy is going on so will leave it now until that finishes
[11:58] <Kilos> eish
[11:58] <mazal> Hy try my geduld
[11:59] <mazal> Moet mos altyd so gaan , niks kan net reg werk nie
[11:59] <inetpro> mazal: to be honest I have never used the event log in putty
[11:59] <inetpro> perhaps it is part of an addon
[11:59]  * inetpro read about it at http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/07/10-practical-putty-tips-and-tricks-you-probably-didnt-know/
[12:01] <inetpro> 0.62 seems like it is the latest version
[12:22] <Kilos> hi nlsthzn compliments of the season to you
[12:23] <Kilos> they cant change new year to some other date methinks
[12:24] <nlsthzn> Hiya uncle Kilos , best for 2013 to you too :)

[13:02] <Kilos> inetpro, was counting down yesterday nlsthzn 
[13:02] <nlsthzn> lol, I was in the big city to I forgot about it a bit
[13:03] <tuxmaster> new ubuntu phone yesterday, passed matric today , the worlds by oyster tomorrow
[13:03] <nlsthzn> congrats tuxmaster 
[13:03] <Kilos> haha
[13:03] <Kilos> well done
[13:03] <superfly> nlsthzn: lots of hype over nothing much.
[13:04] <tuxmaster> thank you, thank you
[13:04] <nlsthzn> superfly, the canonical way (but the interface and some of their ideas are cool.. coming to a google devioce near you soon :p
[13:04] <nlsthzn> talking of android... what a PITA to get my phone back to stock sheeese (so much easier to root and install custom roms :p)
[13:05] <superfly> nlsthzn: I haven't rooted yet
[13:05] <superfly> nlsthzn: a few small irritations, but using the Launcher app from the Play store has solved *most* of the irritating things about the Samsung launcher
[13:06] <nlsthzn> root is safe enough... but there isn't a custom rom that has all my hardware working properly... always something or other glitchy (at least stock it works)
[13:06] <nlsthzn> I purchased nova launcher just when I got mine, I like it 
[13:08] <nlsthzn> I am now downloading a stockish rom to flash, then odin might be able to install the real rom without issues... because I have a rom that basically makes my s3 a nexus device odin thinks it is a nexus and wants to use the nexus kernel or something and not the s3 kernels I downloaded (facepalm)
[13:11] <nlsthzn> http://socloseyoucanalmostbobbleit.com/ <--- this was almost the announcment
[13:13] <tumbleweed> tuxmaster: \o/

[14:30] <Kilos> theblazehen, wassup
[14:30] <Kilos> peer getting you
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[15:08] <Kilos> hi smileee 
[15:08] <Kilos> eeee
[15:09] <smileee> hi Kilos :D
[16:06] <Squirm> evening
[16:06] <Kilos> hmm
[16:06] <Kilos> hi Squirm 
[16:07] <Kilos> Trix[a]r_za,  wanted to chat about the redhat course
[16:10] <Squirm> he could have sent me a whatsapp
[16:10]  * Squirm shrugs
[16:10] <Kilos> hell most likely be back
[16:10] <Squirm> we run an irc server together. so he will be
[16:11] <Kilos> ah
[16:11] <Kilos> where is the server?
[16:11] <Squirm> what do you mean by that question
[16:11] <Squirm> the physical location, or the address
[16:11] <Kilos> where physically
[16:12] <Kilos> im trying to work out what servers are actually for
[16:12] <Kilos> and where and how they do what they do
[16:12] <Squirm> one is in Michigan, US, the other in Paris
[16:13] <Kilos> as in , i have server running here and can ssh it but dunno what else to do
[16:13] <Squirm> the one in Michigan is a small, dedicated server. the one in Paris, we just have a shell account on someones server
[16:13] <Kilos> eek
[16:13] <Kilos> do you hire space on them or what
[16:13] <Squirm> the dedicated server, is actually a whole server
[16:14] <Squirm> we kind of, rent a server in a data center
[16:14] <Squirm> the shell account, is like what magespawn did for you. create an account on someone else's server
[16:15] <Kilos> oh i see
[16:15] <Squirm> we just run bnc, ircd, janus, few bots
[16:15] <Kilos> but what does one do with that shell account
[16:15] <Kilos> few bot?
[16:15] <Kilos> whew
[16:15] <Squirm> it runs an ircd
[16:15] <Squirm> and a bot, i think
[16:15] <Squirm> that shell account we got for free from one of our chatters
[16:16] <Kilos> ah
[16:16] <Squirm> I think, as a speed test. I downloaded the Ubuntu desktop distro under 5min
[16:16] <Squirm> so 700mb
[16:16] <Kilos> wow
[16:16] <Squirm> that's on the shell
[16:16] <Kilos> 733
[16:16] <Squirm> the dedi is not as fast
[16:18] <Squirm> so they don't do much
[16:19] <Kilos> explain nicely , do you have a kinda chat thing on one that peeps logon to then you all chat?
[16:19] <Squirm> Kilos: what do you mean?
[16:19] <Kilos> what does the server do?
[16:19] <Squirm> ircd
[16:19] <Squirm> irc server
[16:20] <magespawn> Kilos server are good for two broad things storing files/info and running programs, usually one that do things automatically or for other people to use.
[16:22] <Kilos> running programs like what magespawn ?
[16:23] <Kilos> oh as in ian uses one to store cctv
[16:24] <Squirm> Kilos: main ones, I guess are internet, email
[16:24] <Squirm> user accounts
[16:24] <Squirm> internet being, website
[16:24] <magespawn> or a mail server, webserver like we were talking about before
[16:25] <Squirm> we run a proxy server at the school, basically monitors and filters out bad webpages before passing them on to the student
[16:25] <Kilos> ah
[16:25] <magespawn> or for online games like world of warcraft
[16:26] <Kilos> ah
[16:27] <Squirm> Kilos: think of what services you use over the net
[16:27] <Squirm> skype
[16:27] <Squirm> mxit
[16:27] <Squirm> msn messanger
[16:27] <Squirm> jabber
[16:27] <Kilos> yes but i mean a personal server
[16:27] <magespawn> this irc
[16:28] <magespawn> you store files on it so that you access them from another machine 
[16:28] <Kilos> im trying to see the advantage of having your own server
[16:28] <magespawn> servers generally do not get switched off
[16:29] <Kilos> have you worked out how to ssh through a 3g yet
[16:29] <Kilos> as in can you ssh my server
[16:29] <magespawn> well i use one at home to store music, movies and pictures so that if the wife want to watch a movie we can while the kids watch something different
[16:29] <Kilos> oh Squirm my bot greets on my channel
[16:29] <Kilos> had some help from my friends
[16:30] <magespawn> you would have to find a way to get your external ip address
[16:30] <Kilos> aha
[16:30] <Squirm> nice
[16:30] <magespawn> then we can do it
[16:30] <magespawn> but will be slow and if you do a lot you could eat up the gigs
[16:31] <Kilos> yeah was just interested
[16:32] <Kilos> as in i could put stuff on it for ian and he can fetch rather than use ubuntu0ne or dropbox
[16:34] <Squirm> Kilos: the nice things about those external servers. is you upload it ONCE and people can download it MANY times. so you only use your bandwidth to upload.
[16:34] <Kilos> yeah
[16:34] <Kilos> but i have nothing anyone but ian could use
[16:35] <Kilos> like mb drivers
[16:44] <nastja> I greet you on behalf of Russian Linux community!

[16:54] <Kilos> yes but spped is about 300 kB/s
[16:55] <Kilos> speed
