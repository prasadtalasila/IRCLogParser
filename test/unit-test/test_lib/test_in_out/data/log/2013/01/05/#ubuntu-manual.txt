[09:04] <thorwil> godbyk: i managed to forget to push yesterday
[09:05] <thorwil> now i have a diverged branch
[09:05] <godbyk> thorwil: No worries. I had plenty of other ones to work on.
[09:06] <godbyk> thorwil: You should be able to merge cleanly. Or uncommit, pull, then commit and push.
[09:06] <godbyk> The only things I've worked on in that repository are with the translation files. So you shouldn't have any merge conflicts with the covers or title pages.
[09:08] <thorwil> godbyk: chose the uncommit route. good thing the commands have such clear names. cover with dutch backside pushed
[09:09] <godbyk> thorwil: Got it. Thanks!  I find that the uncommit route usually works best.
[09:12] <thorwil> a client company made me use a svn hosted by them. i proposed git/bitbucket, but they are not familiar with git. few weeks later, changes to commit after a break. their server unavailable
[09:12] <thorwil> their being afraid of the new pays off ...
[09:13] <godbyk> Gah..
[09:13] <godbyk> I've been primarily using git of late.
[09:13] <godbyk> Switching between git, bzr, and svn drives me batty sometimes, though.
[09:14] <godbyk> Some commands are named the same but do different things under different version control systems.
[09:14] <godbyk> Some commands aren't named nicely.  (git seems especially non-intuitive to me.)
[09:14] <thorwil> after bzr and git, the not-distributed model feels wrong. even though there is no forgetting to push there :)
[09:14] <godbyk> I do like being about to commit locally, though, and make branches cheaply.
[09:21] <godbyk> thorwil: CreateSpace didn't balk at your cover, so I'm assuming it's all good. :-)
[09:21] <godbyk> thorwil: They do however take a day to 'review all the files' before releasing it for publication however.
[09:22] <thorwil> ok
[09:22] <godbyk> thorwil: Assuming everything passes review, the Dutch version of precise-e2 should be available in a day or two.
[09:23] <godbyk> thorwil: Did I provide you enough info to easily generate the cover?  I just wrote a Python script to do all the math, so I can have it emit more info if you like.
[09:25] <thorwil> godbyk: paper size and spine width is sufficient, as the bleed is what's left after subtracting 2 times A4 + spine, right?
[09:25] <godbyk> thorwil: Yep. I think the bleed is 1/8-inch all around (but don't quite me on that).
[09:27] <CarstenG> Hi
[09:27] <godbyk> Hey, CarstenG.
[09:27] <thorwil> hi
[09:27] <CarstenG> Thosten: You have 10.04 in the Dutch cover
[09:27] <CarstenG> Sould be 12.04, or?
[09:27] <CarstenG> Should...
[09:28] <godbyk> CarstenG: It should be 12.04, yeah.
[09:28] <godbyk> Did I miss that, too?
[09:28] <CarstenG> copy paste mistake from lucid :-)
[09:29] <thorwil> i should be taken out behind the barn and shot
[09:29] <godbyk> CarstenG, thorwil: I just fixed it and pushed the update.
[09:29] <godbyk> thorwil: Keep this up and I'll stop brow-beating you into making all these covers for me! ;-)
[09:29] <thorwil> heh
[09:31] <godbyk> Looks like I can't upload the new cover until they finish reviewing things. Oh, well.
[09:31] <godbyk> With that, I'm off to sleep.
[09:31] <godbyk> Thanks for your help this morning, gentlemen!
[09:32] <CarstenG> Good night!
[09:32] <CarstenG> See you
[09:32] <thorwil> godbyk: nite, cya
[09:32] <godbyk> G'night, all!
[12:40] <sagaci>  bang
