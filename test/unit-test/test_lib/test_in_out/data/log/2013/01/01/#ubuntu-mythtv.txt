[07:21] <ejohnson_> i am getting this error pn my mythbuntu server when I try to connect my xbmc client "Client speaks protocol version 8 but we speak 72"
[07:23] <ejohnson_> mythtv version is 0.25 [v0.25.3-25-g18c793a]
[07:23] <ejohnson_> any ideas on how to fix this?
[15:29] <wangel> Where in X does Mythbuntu auto-start the MythFrontend?
