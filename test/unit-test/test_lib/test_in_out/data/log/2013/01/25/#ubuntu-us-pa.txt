[00:49] <ChinnoDog> Are your songs protected by raid 10?
[02:06] <ChinnoDog> This sata controller card is just slightly out of tolerance such that it does not line up with my PCI slot. What an unusual problem
[04:00] <ChinnoDog> My computer didn't like having so many int13 extensions. I had to disable the RAID in my BIOS. :-( Now running with 6 hard drives and new video card.
[10:23] <rmg51> Morning
[12:11] <JonathanD> hi
[12:26] <rmg51> bye
[13:06] <teddy-dbear> Morning peoples
[13:32] <HowdyDoody> morning bears
[20:14] <ChinnoDog> bacon
[20:19]  * HowdyDoody drops a pin
[20:21]  * TheLordOfTime picks up the pin, and melts it down for base metals.
[20:22] <HowdyDoody> all your base belong to us
[20:37] <ChinnoDog> s/base belong/base are belong/
[21:00] <jedijf> in the meadow.....
[21:02] <ChinnoDog> Someone added "bacon" as a test product in the order system I am working on.
[21:03] <TheLordOfTime> was it you?
[21:04] <ChinnoDog> nope
[21:06] <ChinnoDog> Eggs is a separate product
[21:06] <ChinnoDog> toast is probably next
[21:06] <TheLordOfTime> apple pie!
[21:06] <HowdyDoody> and OJ
[21:06]  * TheLordOfTime wants apple pie
[21:06] <ChinnoDog> Make one
[21:06] <HowdyDoody> Some even demand coffee
[21:06] <TheLordOfTime> GIVE ME COFFEE OR I SHALL BRING DOOM TO THE WORLD!
[21:07] <TheLordOfTime> (sorry random coffee-needed outburst :/)
[21:07] <TheLordOfTime> ohey perfect timing... *sips the coffee*
[21:35] <ChinnoDog> Can the same home folder successfully be used for both Windows and Ubuntu? I tried this once and there were issues.
[21:35] <ChinnoDog> Assume home is on a network share and permissions issues are resolved
[21:46] <ChinnoDog> I think I already made up my mind how I am going to handle this
[21:47] <ChinnoDog> Windows and Linux need separate home folders and all the shared folders go somewhere else
[21:52] <pleia2> I didn't even know Windows had a home folder
[21:52] <JonathanD> it has a "users" thing now.
[21:52] <pleia2> but it would have to be ext3 or something to preserve linux permissions and I think Windows needs a plugin to support it
[21:53] <pleia2> I've shared data directories (movies, music, etc) but I figured the windows "users" thing and the linux home directory were too different, the web browsers can't easily share each others profiles and things afaik
[21:53] <ChinnoDog> If it is on a network share neither OS needs a special driver
[21:54] <ChinnoDog> Yea, that is the problem. The data files produced could collide and they are incompatible
[21:55] <pleia2> what exactly are you trying to achieve?
[21:55] <JonathanD> I think there are a lot of things in windows users folder that are profile related.
[21:55] <ChinnoDog> I think I can preserve linux permissions even on a Windows file share by configuring mount correctly
[21:55] <JonathanD> I'd do it a different way.
[21:55] <ChinnoDog> Keeping my data separate from my operating systems
[21:55] <pleia2> what kind of data?
[21:56] <ChinnoDog> All user generated data, which means the entire contents of my home folder on both systems
[21:56] <pleia2> photos, movies, music, etc is all easy, profiles and things for software make it hard, which is why people tend to have media shares, not home directory
[21:56] <pleia2> I don't think it makes a lot of sense to share a home directory
[21:57] <JonathanD> I think maybe redirecting documents/music/photos would make sense.
[21:57] <ChinnoDog> It would if they didn't collide. All data in one place.
[22:17] <ChinnoDog> With a vGPU provided by hyper-v there aren't any screen handling defects on the VM console. Neat.
[22:19] <jedijf> i would do a media share - nothing else - media being any file that plays well in all worlds - common filetypes - anything else is unreasonable
[22:20] <jedijf> or use that public windows folder
[22:49] <ChinnoDog> Not so sure vGPU is being used now but I don't know how to explain why the mouse does not give me issues anymore
