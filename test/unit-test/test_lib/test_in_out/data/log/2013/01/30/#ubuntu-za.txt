[10:11] <staticrat> now messing around on mint, trying to figure out how to remove the separator from the favorite menu
[10:11] <Kilos> you want for mint. so linux drivers
[10:11] <staticrat> yes
[10:11] <staticrat> i will check out this link
[10:12] <Kilos> i didnt check if its for linux
[10:12] <staticrat> i see it does have a download for ubuntu 10.10

[10:15] <staticrat> the reason i was looking for one is when I connect a projector to my notebook my display changes to 1024x800
[10:16] <Kilos> all for win7

[10:18] <Kilos> sjoe hang around. maybe one of the guys will have an idea
[10:18]  * staticrat hanging around for ideas :)
[10:18] <Kilos> hehe
[10:19] <staticrat> i feel dumb today
[10:19] <Kilos> what maaz cant find for me i ask here for help
[10:19] <Kilos> but
[10:20] <Kilos> if the netbook thing works and only changes when you plugin the projector it might be some settings you gotta change
[10:21] <staticrat> think so as well but did see that when I connect the projector I cant change the resolution
[10:22] <staticrat> not that big of an issue, this is just for learning purposes. you know  - knowing how to fix this for future reference
[10:22] <Kilos> ah
[10:22] <staticrat> first i need to get used to this workspace thing
[10:23] <staticrat> :)
[10:23] <magespawn> i think there is a setting under displays where you can specify two different resolutions one for each display
[10:23] <Kilos> look here and see what they say
[10:24] <Kilos> http://community.linuxmint.com/hardware/view/1158
[10:24] <superfly> staticrat: which graphics card?
[10:27] <staticrat> ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4570 graphics
[10:28] <superfly> staticrat: using the proprietary drivers, or the open source ones?
[10:28] <staticrat> open source I think
[10:29] <superfly> then just use the built-in screen tool to set up your resolutions
[10:30] <superfly> I don't use Gnome, so I can't help you with anything Gnome specific, but I've done it tons before in KDE
[10:30] <staticrat> i will give it another bash just now....will feedback results
[10:31] <inetpro> Kilos: better 8ta speeds? Sounds nice. Let me know the results.
[10:31] <Kilos> will do inetpro 
[10:32] <Kilos> waiting for friday to put new 2+1 in
[11:29]  * staticrat is back
[11:30] <Kilos> fixed?
[11:30] <staticrat> nope :(
[11:30] <Kilos> ai
[11:30] <staticrat> very weird to me
[11:31] <staticrat> once projector is connected it displays the second workspace but no app is displayed when moving it towards the workspace
[11:32] <staticrat> when I enable to mirror my display it then causes my notebook monitor to display at a lower resolution 
[11:33] <Kilos> did you install the ati driver?
[11:33] <staticrat> i did but no luck with that as well
[11:34] <Kilos> has mint got a goodie called additional drivers
[11:34] <staticrat> not as far as I know
[11:34] <Kilos> where do you plug the projector in? usb
[11:35] <Kilos> i never seen that
[11:35] <staticrat> no via VGA
[11:35] <Kilos> ah
[11:36] <staticrat> perhaps I should test with HDMI
[11:37] <staticrat> no matter I will play around some more, whats happening here today?
[11:38] <Kilos> everyone saltmining
[11:38] <Kilos> except me
[11:38] <staticrat> lol
[11:39] <Kilos> someone will comeup with another suggestion some time
[11:40] <Kilos> i know nothing about what you are doing
[11:40] <magespawn> i am not sure where it is under unity, but under monitors somewhere allows you to cahnge the settings
[11:40] <Kilos> he is on mint magespawn 
[11:40] <Kilos> hiya
[11:40] <staticrat> menu > control centre > monitors
[11:41] <staticrat> and the guys at #linuxmint-chat is not as friendly as you peeps are
[11:41] <staticrat> did not even get a response :(
[11:41] <Kilos> no other channel matches with #ubuntu-za
[11:42] <staticrat> perhaps i should reload my pc and try ubuntu
[11:43] <Kilos> lol
[11:43] <Kilos> its different now to when you tried
[11:43] <staticrat> LOL - using mint but looking towards ubuntu users for support
[11:43] <Kilos> have you looked at kubuntu
[11:43] <staticrat> think i ran a liveCD some time ago
[11:44] <Kilos> the guys here help any linux person
[11:44] <Kilos> with kde you have 2 experts here
[11:44] <Kilos> the fly and pro
[11:44] <staticrat> they are?
[11:44] <Kilos> they live on kubuntu
[11:44] <Kilos> superfly, and inetpro 
[11:45] <staticrat> nd u?
[11:45] <Kilos> i have it on another drive but im learning too
[11:45] <staticrat> you using gnome?
[11:46] <Kilos> actually quite lekker when you get to understand it a bit
[11:46] <Kilos> im on unity
[11:46] <Kilos> ubuntu 12.04
[11:46] <Kilos> LTS
[11:46] <Kilos> ubuntu has moved from gnome to unity
[11:47] <staticrat> well i am not mr current affairs so when was this move? last ubuntu i used still ran on gnome
[11:47] <Kilos> 18 months ago or so
[11:47] <Kilos> since 11.04
[11:47] <Kilos> i think
[11:48] <staticrat> ah 
[11:48] <inetpro> staticrat: so you have two VGA outputs?
[11:48] <Kilos> but even unity you can get used to
[11:48] <Kilos> there the pro
[11:48] <inetpro> eh
[11:49] <staticrat> no just one inetpro
[11:49] <inetpro> ahh, you wanted output on the laptop as well as on the big screen?
[11:49] <Kilos> a netbook is a lappy thing hey?
[11:49] <inetpro> many times it also depends on the projector
[11:51] <staticrat> no I would just like to change the display settings on my notebook monitor when the projector is connected. Who uses 800x600 today
[11:52] <superfly> staticrat: most projectors are way behind screens
[11:52] <inetpro> projectors come with different resolutions 
[11:52] <superfly> they've only *just* started bringing out widescreen projectors
[11:53] <staticrat> and I got one of those, actually pretty cool. EPSON EB-95
[11:53] <inetpro> Kilos: a netbook is smaller than a laptop
[11:53] <staticrat> who invented a netbook?
[11:54]  * staticrat giving a opinion
[11:54]  * inetpro loves the netbook
[11:54] <superfly> staticrat: so is your notebook's screen becoming 800x600 ?
[11:54] <inetpro> baught one for my wife some time ago and she's still using it
[11:55] <superfly> *bought
[11:55] <inetpro> IIRC it was even two years ago
[11:55] <staticrat> inetpro: tablet or netbook
[11:55] <inetpro> superfly: correct, thanks :-)
[11:55] <inetpro> staticrat: netbook
[11:55] <staticrat> superfly: yes  it does
[11:55] <inetpro> one of those R1999 Acer specials
[11:56] <staticrat> I remember those did they not come pre-installed with some linux distro
[11:57] <inetpro> staticrat: not sure what it was, first thing I did was to install Kubuntu
[11:57] <staticrat> lol
[11:57] <inetpro> she's now running on Unity but still prefers KDE
[11:57]  * inetpro should change that at some point
[11:58] <staticrat> ubuntu or kubuntu /me looking at downloading one of the two
[11:59] <Kilos> they both say kubuntu
[11:59] <staticrat> i like mint but have to be honest. There too much of a 'microsoft' feel to it
[12:00] <Kilos> if you got fast uncapped internet get both
[12:00] <Kilos> then you can see what you prefer
[12:00] <superfly> staticrat: so just go to system settings -> monitors and resolutions and check that your screen resolution is correct
[12:00] <staticrat> im in limpopo? they steal the lines faster than you can download
[12:00] <Kilos> lol like here. 3g is costly though
[12:01] <staticrat> superfly: I did but once the projector is connected I cannot change the screen resolution 
[12:01] <superfly> xrandr
[12:01]  * staticrat thinks he need to re-establish what he know about linux
[12:04] <Kilos> https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Xrandr
[12:04] <Kilos> see what they say
[12:04] <Kilos> only one i saw
[12:04] <staticrat> thx
[12:04] <Kilos> superfly, you will need to help him nearly like me
[12:05] <Kilos> oh staticrat have you upgraded
[12:05] <staticrat> upgraded?
[12:06] <Kilos> you know how to use a terminal?
[12:06] <Kilos> where you type in commands
[12:06] <staticrat> yes I am familiar with using the terminal
[12:06] <staticrat> lol
[12:06] <Kilos> sudo apt-get update
[12:07] <Kilos> then sudo apt-get upgrade
[12:07] <Kilos> then watch data run
[12:08] <Kilos> does mint use apt-get and aptitude?
[12:08] <staticrat> apt-get
[12:08] <Kilos> ok check for update/upgrades
[12:08] <staticrat> some index files failed to download
[12:09] <staticrat> after running sudo apt-get update
[12:09] <Kilos> some or did it get some?
[12:09] <staticrat> they have been ignored or old ones used instead
[12:09] <Kilos> Squirm, ping
[12:09] <Kilos> ok
[12:09] <Kilos> you have an update manager
[12:10] <Kilos> do you see it in system
[12:10] <staticrat> yeah but it says the same message. started this morning but just didnt have time to look into it. 
[12:10] <Kilos> system admin
[12:11] <Kilos> normally thats internet connection or your repo is down
[12:11] <staticrat> the sudo apt-get upgrade finished 
[12:12] <Kilos> what did it get?
[12:12] <Kilos> too fast to see?
[12:12] <staticrat> lol
[12:12] <staticrat> yeah
[12:12] <Kilos> hehe
[12:12] <staticrat> was about to say loads of things moving fast
[12:12] <Kilos> did it say how much was downloaded
[12:13] <Kilos> should say fetched xx meg in so much time
[12:13] <staticrat> might have ... I closed the window before reading the results...
[12:13] <Kilos> ai
[12:13] <staticrat> i know 
[12:14] <Kilos> how fast is your internet there
[12:14] <Kilos> normally the diffs between a clean install and the first upgrade is 100's of megs
[12:14] <staticrat> well I have 4MB UC/US line
[12:15] <Kilos> it didnt want to reboot to complete the upgrade?
[12:15] <staticrat> well i did that yesterday via the update manager and it downloaded about 250MB 
[12:15] <Kilos> ah
[12:15] <staticrat> no
[12:16] <staticrat> but there is a few things that annoys me with mint (or it could be the user)
[12:17] <Kilos> superfly, inetpro advice on whether to get kde or unity and what release
[12:17] <Kilos> our mint user isnt talking
[12:18] <staticrat> the 'hot corner" to which between workspaces doesnt work
[12:18] <staticrat> *switch
[12:19] <Kilos> ive never seen mint staticrat so im lost there
[12:19]  * staticrat downloading ubuntu 12.04.1 desktop 32bit
[12:19] <Kilos> ok thats what i got
[12:20] <Kilos> but i need help too
[12:20] <staticrat> kilos: me either that why i installed to see how mint works.
[12:20] <Kilos> so bare with me
[12:20] <Kilos> lol
[12:20] <inetpro> staticrat: your best option is to try things for yourself
[12:20]  * inetpro prefers Kubuntu
[12:20] <staticrat> inetpro: exactly :)
[12:20] <inetpro> I have never used Mint but know some people who like it
[12:21] <magespawn> inetpro i have found that Kubuntu is the biggest learning curve coming from the other os
[12:21] <inetpro> but as far as I am aware even with Mint you have the option to run your choice of window manager
[12:22] <staticrat> well I used to run ubuntu and fedora 
[12:22] <inetpro> magespawn: that is probably because Unity is scaled down 
[12:22] <inetpro> magespawn: they leave the average user with little choice 
[12:22] <inetpro> you can't customise as many things as with KDE
[12:23] <Kilos> unity isnt bad staticrat 
[12:23] <magespawn> kde give TONS of choice
[12:23]  * inetpro loves choice
[12:23] <Kilos> lol
[12:23] <staticrat> kilos: we will soon find out - the next time we chat I will be running ubuntu :)
[12:23] <Kilos> kde doesnt bloep
[12:24]  * inetpro hates having to sit in one corner all day
[12:24] <Kilos> staticrat, how do you get here
[12:25] <staticrat> pidgin
[12:25] <Kilos> ai
[12:25] <Kilos> install xchat
[12:25] <Kilos> not xchat-gnome

[12:25] <Kilos> ai die busie weer
[12:25] <Kilos> buisie
[12:26] <staticrat> does xchat comes default with ubuntu?
[12:27] <Kilos> nope you type in sudo apt-get install xchat
[12:27] <staticrat> thx
[12:27]  * staticrat reloading notebook - away with mint
[12:27] <Kilos> after sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[12:28] <Kilos> and also sudo apt-get install aptitude
[12:28] <staticrat> ok guys see you soon
[12:28] <Kilos> pidgin is for gtalk and msn and mxit

[12:30] <Kilos> who remembers where the link is to the unity guide
[12:31] <Kilos> http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/Manual/UserGuide.html
[12:31] <Kilos> methinks
[12:33] <superfly> Kilos: no, that's to Unity3D, a game engine
[12:38] <magespawn> isn't mint based on ubuntu?
[12:39] <Kilos> ai
[12:42] <Kilos> what ever happened to sflr
[12:48] <Kilos> http://ubuntu-za.org/sites/default/files/unity-5-10-0-final-pdf.pdf
[12:48] <Kilos> is that it

[12:58] <superfly> magespawn: really?
[12:58] <superfly> (not for resistance, but for no invite)
[12:59] <magespawn> yes or at least i did not see one 
[12:59] <superfly> magespawn: submit portals all over hluhluwe, and then go capture them when they are approved :-)
[13:00] <magespawn> still going through the training
[13:09]  * staticrat is back
[13:10] <staticrat> man have there been changes in ubuntu or what
[13:12] <magespawn> superfly how do you see portals
[13:12]  * magespawn goes to google
[13:14] <magespawn> a few staticrat
[13:14] <staticrat> well i do like the look
[13:14] <staticrat> now let the exploring begin
[13:15] <Kilos> lol wb staticrat 
[13:15] <staticrat> thx kilos
[13:15] <Kilos> i think this gives you a book
[13:15] <Kilos> http://ubuntu-za.org/sites/default/files/unity-5-10-0-final-pdf.pdf
[13:16] <Kilos> the bar on the left is your launcher
[13:16] <staticrat> sweet
[13:16] <Kilos> top is the dash
[13:16] <staticrat> ok
[13:16] <Kilos> in dash you type ter and get a terminal
[13:16] <Kilos> or ctrl + alt + t
[13:17] <staticrat> cool was looking for terminal as soon as i logged in
[13:17] <Kilos> hehe
[13:17] <Kilos> i struggled in the beginning
[13:18] <Kilos> have you updated/upgraded?
[13:18] <staticrat> yeah done that
[13:18] <staticrat> got xchat
[13:18] <Kilos> try this one too
[13:18] <staticrat> run update and still busy with upgarde
[13:18] <Kilos> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[13:18] <staticrat> *upgrade
[13:18] <Kilos> ah
[13:19]  * staticrat will not close the window after upgrade.
[13:19] <Kilos> my one didnt do a full upgrade till i did dist-upgrade
[13:19] <Kilos> at the bottom of the launcher you have workspace switcher
[13:20] <Kilos> i use one for xchat
[13:20] <Kilos> you can open more terminals
[13:21] <staticrat> well this workspaces works for me :)
[13:21] <Kilos> also in launcher there is a terminal icon which will open the terminal you are using on the workspace you are on
[13:21] <Kilos> i use 10
[13:23] <staticrat> do you place the terminal in the launcher or is it there by default
[13:23] <Kilos> it is there
[13:23] <Kilos> black square
[13:23] <Kilos> maybe far down
[13:23] <Kilos> i remove all the libre office stuff
[13:24] <Kilos> right click remove from panel/launcher or something
[13:24] <Kilos> every new app you have running will show there
[13:25] <Kilos> and flash when somethiong happens
[13:25] <staticrat> cool 
[13:25] <Kilos> or as with xchat put the number of messages you have received
[13:25] <staticrat> what mail client do you use?
[13:25] <Kilos> i use evolution
[13:26] <Kilos> dont like thunderbird
[13:26] <staticrat> ok, good support for exchange?
[13:26] <superfly> magespawn: ingress.com/intel
[13:26] <Kilos> whats exchange?
[13:27] <magespawn> superfly my screen keeps going black maybe a bug, shows the scanner but nothing else
[13:27] <staticrat> I am a windows user. That is where my money comes from, thanks to Bill Gates I have a job
[13:27] <staticrat> Microsoft Exchange Server
[13:27] <Kilos> lol
[13:27] <Kilos> shame
[13:28] <Kilos> try evolution if it dont work then we find something else
[13:28] <staticrat> yip the way I see it is that MS created a "dodgy OS" and there needs to be someone to solve the problems
[13:28] <staticrat> or try
[13:29] <Kilos> i dont know about that stuff but evolution works with gmail hotmail yahoo etc
[13:29] <Kilos> so who knows if it works with microstinks
[13:30] <Kilos> also evo can make its own backup folder for future installs
[13:30] <staticrat> I will find out for you and let you know. I still need to support MS systems
[13:30] <Kilos> you can still
[13:30] <Kilos> lost of the guys here work on ms pcs as well
[13:30] <Kilos> have no choice
[13:31] <staticrat> well like a famous man once said: I like choice
[13:31] <Kilos> but ms help needs to be discussed on another channel as its kinda off topic here
[13:31] <Kilos> lol
[13:31] <staticrat> not going to ask MS help here
[13:32] <staticrat> but I am going to annoy you all with ubuntu help
[13:32] <Kilos> for other os help you can ask on my channel

[16:57] <inetpro> jy kon enige onderwerp maklik studeer
[16:57] <Kilos> daar is ook die stad se biblioteke
[16:58] <inetpro> nou is daar net sommige mense wat weet hoe om die inligting op die netwerke te vind
[16:58] <inetpro> ander betaal daarvoor
[16:58] <inetpro> en die res het niks 
[16:58] <inetpro> eintlik die meerderheid het nie 'n benul nie
[16:58] <Kilos> ja
[16:58] <Kilos> ek gaan eet gou
[16:59] <inetpro> lekker eet oom
[16:59] <Lionthinker> inetpro, yeh I'm thinking about the Consumer protection avenue as a way to do something about the lack of Ubuntu computers for sale and redmond's dominance

[17:00] <inetpro> Lionthinker: looks like you have some frustrations to get rid of?
[17:00] <Lionthinker> nope, just followed the email lists frustrations but prefer to do something than to sit and complain

[17:20] <Kilos> you okes
[17:21] <Kilos> ubuntu-za@lists.ubuntu.com

[17:21] <inetpro> Kilos: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-za
[17:21] <Kilos> yes but unity gives you the choice of additional drivers
[17:21] <inetpro> Kilos: it's linked above
[17:22] <staticrat_m> I saw
[17:22] <staticrat_m> Made it rather easy
[17:22] <Kilos> yeah it does when its automatic hey
[17:22] <inetpro> staticrat_m: welcome back
[17:22] <staticrat_m> Ubuntu 1 mint 0 lol
[17:22] <staticrat_m> Ty inetpro
[17:23] <Kilos> you most likely will need to reinstall everytime they do big upgrades
[17:23] <Kilos> kernel upgrades i think
[17:23] <inetpro> Kilos: why?
[17:23] <Kilos> well inetpro 
[17:23] <staticrat_m> Yeah why
[17:24] <staticrat_m> But then again there is a backup utility
[17:24] <Kilos> here by me everytime something updates i go back to that 800x640 screen resolution
[17:24] <inetpro> reinstalls are very rarely necessary
[17:24] <inetpro> Kilos: then you are doing something wrong
[17:24] <Kilos> tell my unity that inetpro 
[17:24] <Kilos> lol
[17:24] <Kilos> ya upgrading
[17:24] <inetpro> ai!
[17:25] <Kilos> oh ya staticrat_m that deja-dup backup works well
[17:25] <staticrat_m> Yeah i shall test it tomorrow
[17:26] <Kilos> but if your graphics driver goe swith upgrading you just type additional drivers in dash and it goes to the job again
[17:26] <Kilos> i used it from 10.10 to get 10 workspaces here
[17:27] <staticrat_m> Busy busy ek se
