[02:59] <bkerensa> :)

[06:09] <JoseeAntonioR> wow, all my friends that thought Ubuntu was nonsense now want to buy an Ubuntu phone and are asking me for prices

[18:42] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: +1

[20:15] <imbrandon> doh, join/part's off
[21:58] <bkerensa> mhall119: they were wondering if things like Thunderbird or Firefox would be able to be ported or whether it would have some qml browser
[22:44] <mhall119> bkerensa: Chances are both will be able to run on the Ubuntu Phone, but I don't know if they would be candidates for default apps.  Do their mobile versions still use XUL?
