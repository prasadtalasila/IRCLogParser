[08:38] <Squirm> morning
[08:38] <Kilos> hi Squirm 
[08:47] <Kilos> superfly, do you know about this http://linux.softpedia.com/get/System/Operating-Systems/Linux-Distributions/Python-OS-87758.shtml
[08:55]  * Squirm is on the next RH course :)
[08:59] <superfly> Kilos: it's on Softpedia, it's not worth knowing :-P
[08:59] <Kilos> oh is that a bad place
[09:03] <Kilos> i though a python OS would be nice and fast and efficient
[09:03] <Kilos> thought
[10:52] <Kilos> yo mazal 
[10:52] <mazal> Lo oom Kilos 
[10:52] <mazal> Gaanit ?
[10:52] <Kilos> ok dankie en self?
[10:52] <mazal> Kla nie dankie
=== Trix[a]r_za is now known as Trixar_za
[14:08] <magespawn> hey Kilos, how the afternoon? Quiet in here i see.
[14:09] <Kilos> lol
[14:20] <Trixar_za> Don't know about you guys, but XKCD's What-if section is always fascinating to me
[14:23] <Kilos> hey Trixar_za has slitaz also got archives
[14:24] <Kilos> and how do you tell your package manager to look there
[14:26] <Trixar_za> Archives in what way?
[14:30] <Kilos> where your pc stores downloaded packages
[14:31] <Trixar_za> If you mean downloaded SliTaz packages, then you just have to double click it to install them
[14:32] <Trixar_za> If you mean zip, 7z, rar (the 'weird' formats) you'll need those non-free packages installed and XArchive to open them
[14:35] <Kilos> no man i mean where are they stored
[14:36] <Kilos> as in we use /var/cahe/apt/archives
[14:36] <Kilos> cache
[14:36] <Trixar_za> Ah, those
[14:36] <Kilos> ya
[14:36] <Trixar_za> /var/cache/tazpkg/stable/packages/
[14:37] <Kilos> ok now
[14:37] <Trixar_za> And generally trying to get-install it makes tazpkg use the cache'd version first
[14:37] <Kilos> lets say you got no internet and copy those from another pc
[14:37] <Trixar_za> You have to use --force to make it download it again
[14:38] <Kilos> how do you get to let your package manager know they are there
[14:38] <Trixar_za> or clear the cache
[14:38] <Trixar_za> Possibly just copy them there and try installing it
[14:38] <Trixar_za> Like I said, it defaults to the cache'd version
[14:39] <Kilos> ok ty . i am looking for a workaround to let apt-get see i have all the packages needed in the cache
[14:39] <Kilos> but it first wants to see online what there should be before checking cache
[14:40] <Trixar_za> We don't have something like AptOnCD or a proxy that allows for local repositories
[14:40] <Trixar_za> although the packages DVD does have a script that does something like this
[14:40] <Kilos> ok ty
[14:41] <Trixar_za> Generally it would be easier to use something like http://pizza.slitaz.me to add the packages to the iso before you download it
[14:42] <Trixar_za> or create a custom flavour based on your current system using tazusb or tazlito
[14:55] <Trixar_za> bbl
[14:55] <Trixar_za> >.> Probably
[14:55] <Trixar_za> :P

[15:03] <inetpro_> Kilos: wanner kom die reen weer?
=== inetpro_ is now known as inetpro
[15:03] <Kilos> AI!

[15:04] <Kilos> 3ml
[15:04] <inetpro> mm
[15:04] <Kilos> daai goed
[15:04] <inetpro> mooi!
[15:05] <inetpro> ek het nie eers gekyk nie
[15:05] <inetpro> ook so bietjie gehad gisteroggend
[15:05] <inetpro> oja en 'n paar druppels gisteraand
[15:05] <Kilos> lol
[15:06] <inetpro> s/druppels/druppeltjies/
[15:06] <Kilos> haha kleintjies
[15:07] <Kilos> werk uit vir my hoe om apt my archives te laat sien sonder eers apt-get hemel toe
[15:10] <Kilos> google weet nie
[15:12] <Kilos> hi henkj 
[15:12] <henkj> hi Kilos 
[15:13] <Kilos> ha can one add apt /var/cache/apt/archives/
[15:19] <Kilos> dont all answer at once
[15:28] <tumbleweed> Kilos: yes, you can put things in there
[15:28] <magespawn> later all
[15:40] <Kilos> just sudo add apt /var/cache/apt/archives/ tumbleweed ?
[15:40] <Kilos> wow that would be wonderful
[15:42] <Kilos> aw add command not found!
[15:42] <tumbleweed> err in that case I misunderstood
[15:43] <tumbleweed> what are you trying to do?
[15:43] <Kilos> im trying to get apt-get update to look in archives for packages
[15:44] <Kilos> because maverick isnt supported anymore
[15:44] <Kilos> so cant do the apt-get update
[15:44] <tumbleweed> change your mirror to old-releases.ubuntu.com
[15:45] <tumbleweed> also, stop using maverick
[15:45] <Kilos> but i got all updates before it expired
[15:45] <Kilos> its on a spare pc tumbleweed that i still have to save everything before i use unity or kde there
[15:46] <Kilos> and its got everything like quassel konversation and all them funny things
[15:46] <tumbleweed> anyway, if apt finds a deb in /var/cache/apt/archives/ it won't have to download it
[15:47] <tumbleweed> but that only applies to packages that it actually has a source for
[15:47] <Kilos> it doesnt look there because it cant first go see whats online
[15:47] <Kilos> ya
[15:49] <Kilos>  how do i change the mirror to old-releases.ubuntu.com please
[15:50] <tumbleweed> edit your /etc/apt/sources.list
[15:50] <Kilos> ah ok ty tumbleweed 
[15:58] <Kilos> do i add a line like this tumbleweed 
[15:58] <Kilos> deb http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/maverick/
[16:04] <Kilos> nope thats not a package list
[16:04] <Kilos> ai
[16:08] <tumbleweed> Kilos: no, it's just http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ instead of http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
[16:08] <tumbleweed> everything else stays the same
[16:10] <Kilos> ok ty very much
[16:17] <Kilos> wbb gonna try that
[16:41] <Kilos> i tried that all over tumbleweed 
[16:41] <Kilos> E: Malformed line 52 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist)
[16:41] <Kilos> E: The list of sources could not be read.
[16:41] <Kilos> that was the last one i added it at the end
[16:43] <tumbleweed> which was?
[16:45] <Kilos> i first put the old one in place of the one you said then tried adding it other places and get list cant be read all over
[16:46] <Kilos> as soon as i remove old-releases then the list is read agin
[16:47] <tumbleweed> what was the full line? I just told you what the source URL should be
[16:47] <tumbleweed> because archive.ubuntu.com doesn't have maverick any more
[16:48] <Kilos> http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
[16:49] <Kilos> im on the maverick pc now
[16:50] <tumbleweed> can you just pastebin your sources.list, and I'll explain
[16:51] <Kilos> http://slexy.org/view/s2Owy4RNS6
[16:52] <tumbleweed> ok, so you currently get lots of 404s, right?
[16:52] <tumbleweed> when you run apt-get update
[16:52] <Kilos> yeah
[16:53] <tumbleweed> so, everywhere where you see archive.ubuntu.com or ls.archive.ubuntu.com or security.ubuntu.com
[16:53] <tumbleweed> change that to old-releases.ubuntu.com
[16:53] <tumbleweed> what's ls?
[16:53] <tumbleweed> Maaz: .ls
[16:53] <Maaz> tumbleweed: ISO doesn't know about any such ccTLD
[16:53] <Kilos> lesotho
[16:54] <tumbleweed> a, thuoght so
[16:54] <Kilos> didnt set away from there to start
[16:54] <tumbleweed> that's the same as za
[16:54] <Kilos> ya
[16:55] <Kilos> ill go change it in update manager
[16:55] <tumbleweed> you need to get maverick-security from there too
[16:55] <tumbleweed> I don't know if update manager will make that easy
[16:56] <Kilos> its busy reloading
[16:57] <Kilos> Failed to fetch http://extras.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/maverick/main/source/Sources.gz  404  Not Found
[16:57] <Kilos> lost more 404's
[16:57] <tumbleweed> ok, you can disable extras
[16:59] <Kilos> here is the new list
[16:59] <Kilos> http://slexy.org/view/s2hqo4rlLN
[17:00] <tumbleweed> doesn't look like you changed *anything* to old-releases.ubuntu.com at all
[17:00] <Kilos> oh no just changed mirrors
[17:00] <tumbleweed> well, that won't help
[17:00] <tumbleweed> none of them have maverick
[17:01] <Kilos> so must i hash all of those?
[17:01] <tumbleweed> no, change them
[17:02] <Kilos> all those unhashed lines?
[17:03] <tumbleweed> yes
[17:03] <Kilos> ok
[17:10] <Kilos> http://slexy.org/view/s21KvfRlNb
[17:10] <Kilos> hope thats right
[17:11] <Kilos> E: Malformed line 10 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist)
[17:11] <Kilos> E: The list of sources could not be read.
[17:11] <Kilos> i go see
[17:13] <Kilos> i dunno what i did wrong there
[17:24] <Kilos> ai
[17:24] <Kilos> http://slexy.org/view/s21IUfLSGJ
[17:24] <Kilos> must i change the hashed lines too tumbleweed ?
[18:09] <tumbleweed> Kilos: you deleted everything after the URL
[18:09] <Kilos> oh my 
[18:10] <Kilos> ok i try fix
[18:10] <Kilos> sorry for the hassles

[18:56] <tumbleweed> np
[19:37] <Kilos> good night all. sleep tight
[20:10] <chilicuil> nlsthzn: hi, =), sry to disturb you, it's just that the pad.ubuntu-uk.org has died.., therefore the registration for the ubuntu loco games is now located here: http://pad.ubuntu.com/LocoGames in the case you guys are still interested in playing, have a great day
[21:04] <superfly> chilicuil: sadly, I think the interest has pretty much waned :-( most of the folks here don't really play those games
[21:06] <chilicuil> superfly: it's ok superfly =), there will be hopefully other events where we all can participate
[21:13] <superfly> chilicuil: a lot
[21:13] <superfly> chilicuil: it is a great initiative
[21:14] <superfly> but these days I don't here as much time at the PC as I used to
[21:16] <superfly> chilicuil: by the way, do you know if omgubuntu.co.uk did an article on your LoCo games? that would get you a lot of publicity 
[21:17] <chilicuil> I dont so, superfly, I'm thinking in emailing the loco mailing lists, do you think that may be agressive?
[21:19] <superfly> chilicuil: no, I think that is a good idea, and send an E-mail to the guys at omgubuntu.co.uk 
[21:20] <chilicuil> I'll do, thanks for the idea superfly
[21:22] <superfly> chilicuil: you're welcome!
[21:23] <superfly> alrighty, bed time, good night everyone!
[21:23] <chilicuil> good night!
