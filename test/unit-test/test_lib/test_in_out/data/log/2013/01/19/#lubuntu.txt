[03:32] <user94202> I installed playonlinux.  Where is the menu entry?
[03:53] <user94202> Tried to install the latest itunes in wine. Didn't work.  Any ideas?
[03:54] <user94202> Also installed playonlinux, but itunes isn't listed in the install menu.
[03:55] <TheLordOfTime> did you check the wine appdb to see if anyone else has succeeded in it?
[03:55] <TheLordOfTime> i know itunes is quite tempermental in wine
[03:56] <user94202> I had an older version of itunes working in wine, but this new version just opens a blank itunes window with no functionality.
[03:57] <user94202> Will check appdb shortly
[03:57] <user94202> Also playonlinux has a bug.  The configuration window refuses to close.
[03:58] <user94202> ah..the first run setup is working...
[03:59] <BWMerlin> Not sure if this is the best place to ask but I really like the Windows 8 theme (not the modern UI the "classic" side of things) does anyone know where I might get an LXDE theme that looks similar?
[04:02] <user94202> itunes 7 is installing now. I found it in playonlinux.
[04:05] <user94202> BWMerlin,  found anything you like in menu > preferences > Customize look and feel   ?
[04:06] <BWMerlin> not really no
[04:06] <BWMerlin> but I need to move away from this grey colour
[04:08] <user94202> BWMerlin:  There's also the openbox configuration manager.
[04:08] <user94202> just a moment i'm checking for themes
[04:08] <BWMerlin> clearlooks is certainly an improvement
[04:11] <user94202> if more themes exist, they're hard to find.
[04:11] <user94202> searching...
[04:14] <user94202> it seems lxde uses GTK+ themes.  Google for gtk themes i guess.
[04:15] <user94202> then it's a matter of installing theme package or moving it to the correct folder.
[04:16] <user94202> /usr/share/themes is where themes are stored.
[04:18] <user94202> Lubuntu uses gtk and openbox themes in combination.
[04:19] <user94202> Openbox themes:  http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:Themes
[04:19] <user94202> might download a few myself :- )
[04:28] <user94202> I just installed a theme from that website and it worked.  I had to use p7zip to extract the archive and move the folder to /usr/share/themes
[04:43] <witeds> good evening every one i need a question answered and don't seem to be wording it right i am trying to find out if there is a way to make it so the system just moves files to the extra hard drive i have mounted as a folder say private in the user directory
[04:48] <user94202> witeds, is it refusing to move when you drag and drop?
[04:49] <witeds> drag and drop only copies the files
[04:49] <witeds> i have it mounted in mnt and linked to personal
[04:49] <witeds> if i mount it directly as personal it also shows the drive in the bookmarks side bar of pcmanfm
[04:51] <user94202> yes, you need to open pcmanfm as root/sudoer
[04:51] <mysteriousdarren> witeds: cut paste?
[04:51] <witeds> why would i when i took ownership
[04:51] <witeds> what iam talkin about is if i want to "move" the file i actualy have to cut and past it
[04:52] <witeds> any thing else just copies it to the drive
[04:55] <user94202> witeds, post your paths so we can see exactly
[04:56] <user94202> source and destination and the linked path
[04:56] <witeds> /dev/sdb2 /mnt/hdda linked to /home/john/personal
[04:57] <witeds> personal is a ln -s link
[04:58] <witeds> and the second hard drive is formated to ext4
[05:00] <user94202> which system file are you trying to move?
[05:00] <user94202> looks like you're trying to move a protected system file to a user folder without sudoer permissions
[05:01] <witeds> just normal stuff like a bash script i have writen
[05:01] <witeds> or 3d model files
[05:02] <witeds> the transfer works fine
[05:02] <witeds> but isnted of move i get a copy
[05:02] <user94202> are those files located in your home directory
[05:02] <witeds> instead*
[05:02] <witeds> yes
[05:02] <user94202> does it move from the  commandline?
[05:03] <witeds> if i were to use mv yes
[05:03] <user94202> but pcmanfm won't move it.. wierd.
[05:04] <witeds> nope instead of doing a move it copies
[05:05] <witeds> which is what i am asking about how to get it to use move insted of copy
[05:05] <user94202> yes i understand. I'm testing it here to see it i can move a file to external device.
[05:06] <witeds> i be leave this is due to moving form one hard drive to another
[05:06] <witeds> i don't know i am still learning mounts and drives stuff my self
[05:06] <witeds> just recently setup the drive
[05:07] <user94202> You're right.  Pcmanfm copies files to external devices by default.
[05:07] <witeds> had it for a few weeks now
[05:07] <user94202> trying to figure out why it copies instead of moving..maybe something in the pcmanfm configuration.
[05:10] <user94202> it's definitly not moving for me either.
[05:11] <user94202> testing..
[05:13] <user94202> bare with me... I think i found a solution!
[05:14] <user94202> To move a file with pcmanfm you have to hold the shift key while dragging and dropping.
[05:14] <witeds> sound great
[05:14] <witeds> that makes things a little easyer
[05:14] <witeds> i am thinking about trying nautilus or another manager though
[05:15] <user94202> Does shift key work?
[05:15] <witeds> would be nice to just drag and drop to move to hard drives copy is fine with usbs and memory cards
[05:15] <user94202> yes, depends on the file manager.  Maybe there is a pcmanfm setting somewhere to fix that?
[05:15] <witeds> yes shift click works
[05:16] <witeds> thanks for your help
[05:17] <user94202> i'm checking the pcmanfm config files
[05:19] <user94202> could even be a window manager issue.  Not sure
[05:38] <witeds> nautilus dose it to but xfe asks
[05:39] <witeds> looks like i will have to live with the shift click thanks for your help user94202
[12:33] <Benkinooby2> hi, my wireless card just stopped working - it can do sudu iwlist wlan0 scan just fine but it can not connect to the wlan any more - other laptops (like this one, ubunut 12.10) still can
[12:33] <Benkinooby2> any ideas?
[12:34] <Benkinooby2> hm, relogin might have fixed it ...
