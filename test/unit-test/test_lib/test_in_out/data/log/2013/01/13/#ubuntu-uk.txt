[16:20] <penguin42> Hey Popey
[17:05] <DJShira> hello
[17:05] <DJShira> im new in Linux etc and have a little problem with my firefox flash
[17:06] <popey> DJShira: hello
[17:06] <DJShira> firefox dont find the flash plugin, i have tryd it now with google chrome and here it works very fine
[17:06] <DJShira> hello popey
[17:07] <brobostigon> chrome has flash already there built into itself. which is seperate from the normal installed flash.
[17:07] <popey> DJShira: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer
[17:07] <DJShira> no, i must install it manual in chrome
[17:07] <popey> DJShira: chrome or chromium?
[17:07] <DJShira> popey i have tryd it
[17:08] <popey> what happens when you run that command?
[17:08] <DJShira> also manual in firefox
[17:08] <DJShira> *chrome
[17:08] <DJShira> its allready installed
[17:08] <popey> brobostigon is right, chrome has flash already built in
[17:08] <popey> what isn't working then?
[17:08] <popey> http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/
[17:08] <popey> does that page tell you what version of flash you have installed?
[17:08] <DJShira> firefox dont fin it
[17:09] <SuperEngineer> DJones: have you retarted since installing it?
[17:09] <DJShira> 11.2
[17:09] <popey> SuperEngineer: not necessary
[17:09] <DJShira> ah wrong
[17:09] <DJShira> i have
[17:09] <DJShira> 11,5,31,137 installed
[17:09] <popey> unless you mean "restarted browser" ☺
[17:09] <popey> ok, good, so you have flash
[17:09] <SuperEngineer> popey... thought it still was... - i'll shut up ;)
[17:09] <popey> hah
[17:10] <DJShira> but in firefox dont work
[17:10] <popey> DJShira: so what exactly isn't working
[17:10] <popey> "don't work" isn't sufficient information
[17:10] <DJShira> firefox cant find flash
[17:10] <popey> what are you doing and what doesn't work?
[17:10] <popey> e.g. what website
[17:10] <DJShira> firefox say i have no flash installed
[17:10] <penguin42> when?
[17:10] <popey> if you visit http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/ in firefox, does it give a version number?
[17:11] <DJShira> nope
[17:11] <popey> what version of ubuntu are you using? and are you using it on a normal pc, not an arm based tablet?
[17:12] <DJShira> i have also tryd to search about my problem via google but nobody have that problem. the flash lib is in the firefox folder etc
[17:13] <DJShira> i have it on my new acer pc
[17:13] <DJShira> i dont know what ubuntu version it exactly is, its based on ubuntu
[17:13] <popey> "based on ubuntu"?
[17:13] <popey> so is it mint?
[17:13] <penguin42> DJShira: Start again, what exactly have you got installed on this PC?
[17:13] <DJShira> you know how i mean, its ubuntu but with many many tools
[17:14] <penguin42> DJShira: No, we don't know - what exactly
[17:14] <DJShira> backttrack
[17:14] <popey> no, I dont know how you mean
[17:14] <popey> right, thats not ubuntu
[17:14] <popey> you want #backtrack
[17:15] <DJShira> it is ubuntu^
[17:15] <popey> no. it is not
[17:15] <popey> it is _based_ on ubuntu. It is not Ubuntu
[17:15] <penguin42> DJShira: You need to be honest if you are going to get any help; please telll us exactly what you have done if you want any
[17:16] <penguin42> DJShira: How exactly did you install flash?
[17:16] <DJShira> havt i also know is, under system - pref, when i click on adobe flash player i get a error message (permission denided)
[17:17] <DJShira> i have install the flashplayer-instzaller via synaptic
[17:17] <DJShira> that has not work
[17:17] <DJShira> then i have erease it and install it manual
[17:17] <DJShira> also dont work
[17:18] <DJShira> then i have install google chrome
[17:18] <DJShira> create a plugins folder
[17:18] <DJShira> copyd the flash plugin in the plugin folder
[17:18] <DJShira> have change the menu command from google chtome to enable plugins
[17:18] <DJShira> start chrome
[17:18] <DJShira> flash work
[17:19] <penguin42> DJShira: I'd go back to installing it via the package and see what's going wrong there
[17:20] <DJShira> install work
[17:20] <DJShira> no probs
[17:21] <DJShira> but firefox cant detect it
[17:21] <brobostigon> does it show in about:plugins in FF ?
[17:21] <DJShira> no
[17:22] <SuperEngineer> DJShira: "Installer for the Adobe Flash plug-in for Mozilla"
[17:22] <popey> i believe there is some information missing here. like it's firefox under wine or something equally odd.
[17:22] <DJShira> but it is in the mozilla/plugins folder
[17:23] <penguin42> popey: Not necessarily, I've seen firefox misbehave like this, but I'm not prepared to debug except via the pacakge
[17:23] <DJShira> nope its not under wine
[17:23] <popey> well, if there's been sufficient dicking about with the system it's hard to know what state its in
[17:23] <penguin42> DJShira: You could try deleting the pluginreg.dat files that are a few levels down in |/.mozilla/firefox   it sometime gets confused about that
[17:23] <DJShira> ok i try
[17:24] <popey> or it's firefox from a tarball or something
[17:24] <popey> people who use backtrack do _odd_ things
[17:24] <popey> IMHO
[17:24] <penguin42> haha
[17:24] <popey> odd as in "using backtrack" being the first one
[17:24] <DJShira> i have also delete the installed firefox and download and install the new from the mozilla homepage
[17:25] <popey> there we go
[17:25] <popey> told you
[17:25] <SuperEngineer> boooom!
[17:26] <penguin42> DJShira: OK, forget it - I'm not helping; you could have told us that 20 minutes ago
[17:26] <DJShira> ok now im confused
[17:26] <penguin42> DJShira: Try somewhere else, not here
[17:26] <DJShira> firefox have delete the plugin self from the folder? OO
[17:28] <DJShira> hu whats now wrong? OO sry when my english is not the best
=== davie_ is now known as ne1
[17:34] <popey> DJShira: i would recommend removing your firefox/mozilla folders in your home directory (or create a new user, so start blank), install firefox from the repository, and flash from the repository "sudo apt-get install --reinstall firefox flashplugin-installer" and then test that install
[17:35] <popey> and focus just on getting that thing fixed, and not muck about with other browsers / download tarballs
[17:35] <popey> also, I would recommend either using Ubuntu or Debian. Backtrack seem to have zero support, and just send their users to ubuntu irc channels which is not the right thing to do
[17:35] <DJShira> ok ty i will try
[17:38] <ali1234> backtrack is for pen testing
[17:38] <ali1234> if you need end user support you shouldn't be using it in the first place
[17:39] <popey> well, indeed
[17:39] <ali1234> i think people confuse "security distro" with "secure distro"
[17:40] <DJShira_> sry crashed
[17:40] <ali1234> http://www.backtrack-linux.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#I.27m_new_to_linux.2C_is_BackTrack_a_good_place_to_start_.3F
[17:43] <DJShira_> yes ok but i thing the basic things like flash etc must work same as in other distr.
[17:43] <penguin42> DJShira_: The way they are installed and managed aren't
[17:44] <ali1234> it's based on ubuntu 10.04
[17:44] <ali1234> so it's basically 3 years out of date now
[17:45] <popey> hah, oh dear
[17:45] <penguin42> although still in support
[17:45] <popey> define support
[17:46] <popey> (from backtrack)
[17:46] <penguin42> popey: 10.04 is still in support
[17:46] <popey> its not 10.04 tho
[17:46] <ali1234> 3 year support on desktop
[17:46] <popey> you know this though ☺
[17:46] <ali1234> so that expires in like 2 months
[17:46] <penguin42> and hence it hasn't yet
[17:46] <popey> thats come around fast
[17:47] <ali1234> support doesn't cover the whole distro anyway
[17:47] <ali1234> it covers packages
[17:47] <popey> it covers ff and flash tho
[17:47] <ali1234> you can tell, because different packages are supported for different timeframes
[17:47] <ali1234> therefore this must be true
[17:47] <popey> you can tell by looking at the package
[17:47] <ali1234> also, define support?
[17:47] <popey> alan@deep-thought:~$ apt-cache show firefox | grep Supported
[17:47] <popey> Supported: 5y
[17:48] <ali1234> when you say "ubuntu is supported for x years" it doesn't mean "we will tell you how to install it"
[17:48]  * penguin42 wonders if popey also has earth
[17:48] <ali1234> it means "we will backport security fixes to these packages"
[17:48] <penguin42> ali1234: No, but it will mean that I'd help someone with it
[17:48] <ali1234> thus if backtrack uses the same repos like mint does, then the backtrack packages are covered by this support, whether the developers like it or not
[17:48]  * penguin42 only got rid of his work laptops 10.04 a couple of months ago
[17:49] <ali1234> well i will help people using 8.04 if they have a good reason to do so
[17:49] <ali1234> i'm not bound by any support contract, the 3y/5y thing is irrelevant to me
[17:49] <ali1234> point being, "supported" is another one of those weasel words
[17:50] <popey> not if you define it
[17:50] <ali1234> to the customer it means "tell me how it works" to developers it means "maintained"
[17:50] <ali1234> yeah but nobody ever does
[17:50] <DJShira_> ah totaly forgotten to post the reinstall errors
[17:50] <ali1234> "stable" is another one
[17:50] <DJShira_> 2013-01-13 18:40:13 ERROR 404: Not Found.  download failed The Flash plugin is NOT installed.
[17:50] <ali1234> to consumer it means "does not crash" - to developers it means "i'm never changing the code again"
[17:50] <popey> there we go DJShira_
[17:51] <popey> so the flashplugin-installer package is getting the "wrong" flash tarball
[17:51] <popey> someone should try and reproduce that on a real 10.04 system
[17:51] <popey> if it's indeed broken then we need to fix it
[17:51] <ali1234> well it's probably an ancient flashplugin-installer trying to download an ancient flashplugin that adobe no longer ships
[17:51] <popey> yes
[17:51] <popey> but we can fix it
[17:51] <popey> i will happily test in a vm later on, but for now I'm off to San Francisco to walk about and drink beer
[17:52] <ali1234> no need to actually try this on a real system, just loook at the packages
[17:52] <popey> ttfn
[17:52] <penguin42> popey: Nice
[17:52] <popey> true, file a bug ali1234 if you feel inclined and I'll poke people
[17:52] <ali1234> it's probably backtrack not importing the newest package
[17:52] <popey> i thought they use the same repo/archive
[17:52] <popey> like mint
[17:52] <popey> anyway, ttfn
[17:53] <ali1234> i dunno if they do or not
[17:53] <penguin42> sounds like bug 1064743

[17:55] <penguin42> my oneiric mint seems to have a mix

[17:59] <ali1234> it's multiverse

[18:00] <ali1234> especially not by canonical

[18:02] <DJShira_> nice :/

[18:02] <ali1234> so i'm 99.99% sure this problem is caused by backtrack being a kang
[18:05] <DJShira_> i have now setup it again (newer version) and why he say and older version is available?
[18:05] <DJShira_> the flash problem is only in firefox
[18:05] <DJShira_> not in chrome
[18:06] <ali1234> i dunno. going for dinner
[18:07] <SuperEngineer> DJShira_: why not just use Chrome then - solves your problem!
[18:07] <brobostigon> as i have said previously, chrome has flash already built into it,
[18:07] <ali1234> you should read the backtrack faq especially this part http://www.backtrack-linux.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#I.27m_new_to_linux.2C_is_BackTrack_a_good_place_to_start_.3F
[18:07] <DJShira_> i have read it
[18:09] <DJShira_> but the flash works,  only not in firefox. I have install the firefox from the mozilla page, intsall the flash from launchpad and yay firefox dont like it
[18:12] <DJShira_> but i have found a interessting thing in the ubuntu folders, called FLASHBLOCK
[18:13] <DJShira_> flashblock desc - Firefox extension that replaces flash plugin by a button
[18:18] <DJShira_> ok i thing i have found how i canmake it work, oh yes the backtrack site have a how to make flash work. great :D
[18:20] <SuperEngineer> What? - you mean backtrack has this answeredon the backtrack site?.... odd that... hmmm
[18:21] <DJShira_> yes, after long sdearch i have found it

[20:14] <directhex> moo.
[21:22] <Azelphur> does anyone get a bug with gedit where the cursor disappears when you minimise it? drives me nuts :(
[21:34] <ali1234> how can you tell that the cursor disappears when you minimize it?
[21:34] <Azelphur> ali1234: I mean, when you bring it up again, the text cursor is gone
[21:34] <Azelphur> so you have no idea where your typing
[21:35] <ali1234> what?
[21:35] <ali1234> gone?
[21:35] <Azelphur> yup
[21:35] <ali1234> hell no i never saw anything like that
[21:35] <ali1234> and i use gedit all day every day
[21:35] <Azelphur> Step 1) Minimise gedit, Step 2) bring gedit back, Step 3) You now don't have a text cursor, enjoy frustration
[21:35] <ali1234> that sounds like a compiz bug tbh
[21:35] <ali1234> sounds like the firefox focus issue
[21:36] <ali1234> where you unminimize firefox and you can't type into anything like URL bar, search bar
[21:36] <Azelphur> Maybe, I get a similar issue with nautilus too
[21:36] <ali1234> you can click in them but there i just no cursor. the windw looks selected too
[21:36]  * Azelphur tries the firefox thing
[21:36] <Azelphur> nah doesn't happen with firefox, just gedit and nautilus.
[21:36] <ali1234> to repro it in firefox i think you have to minimize it, then click a URL in some other app and cause it to unminimize
[21:37] <ali1234> this bug has been fixed and regressed about 5 times in the past 2 years
[21:37] <Azelphur> nope still can't replicate (I used terminal to simulate clicking a link since ff isn't my default browser)
[21:38] <Azelphur> maybe soreau would know since he knows all the compiz things
[21:39] <ali1234> does typing work?
[21:39] <Azelphur> yea typing works
[21:39] <Azelphur> and clicking to set position works
[21:39] <ali1234> it's something different then
[21:39] <Azelphur> yea
[21:40] <ali1234> what if you press insert
[21:41] <ali1234> or change colour scheme
[21:41] <Azelphur> ali1234: cursor still invisible, although it still replaces characters as it should
[21:41] <soreau> Azelphur: Sounds possible that it's a keyboard focus issue. You can try another wm to see if it's compiz
[21:42] <Azelphur> ali1234: colour scheme doesn't fix it

[23:48] <solarcloud_3scrn> why do I always feel like mypetals have torn off everytime I visit this #channel and ask a general question ??Why is that daftykins , WHY ??
[23:48] <daftykins> i'm not sure, are you really a flower? :D
[23:49] <solarcloud_3scrn> I'm a buttercup :)
[23:49] <solarcloud_3scrn> today, anyway.
[23:50] <daftykins> heh
[23:50] <daftykins> truthfully i don't know how that AMD benches against intel atoms
[23:50] <daftykins> but my feeling would be that it's a glorified calculator
[23:50] <solarcloud_3scrn> I had my b.day party, today .. althou my b.day was over a week ago... :)
[23:52] <daftykins> O_O how odd
[23:53] <solarcloud_3scrn> all the restaurants were shut .. so we leave it a week every year ...
[23:53] <cjo> coming from someone that describes themsevles as a flower, relatively not that odd
[23:55] <solarcloud_3scrn> I'd love to see Ubuntu TV on the game stick :: http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/872297630/gamestick-the-most-portable-tv-games-console-ever/
[23:57] <solarcloud_3scrn> although I think that slightly disrupts the Shuttle's vision :)
