[00:58] <iLogical> When I click on Account Settings on empathy to add an account it shows this window in the middle, how can I add an account? I even registered on ubuntu one, but I don't see where to do it there http://i.imgur.com/0q1vC.png
[00:59] <iLogical> I mean
[00:59] <iLogical> to add a facebook account

[09:08] <mandel> morning all!
[10:54] <ali1234> i know what iLogical's problem is
[10:54] <ali1234> he's not running Unity or Gnome, this gnome-control-center hides most of the icons
[11:03] <gatox> good morning!
[11:54] <iLogical> what is this keyring default unlock pass?
[11:55] <iLogical> I tried every password i can think of
[11:55] <mandel> iLogical, is that when you are launching the seahorse app?
[11:55] <mandel> iLogical, AFAIK is your user password
[11:56] <iLogical> I don't know
[11:56] <iLogical> it prompts me when logging to ubuntu one
[11:56] <iLogical> and I can't log in
[11:57] <mandel> iLogical, look for "keys" in the dash and launch that app
[11:57] <mandel> iLogical, try to unlock it there with your user password
[12:13] <iLogical> is there a way in addition to syncing files between my "Ubunto One" folders in my home to be synced always with the same directory when I insert it in one of the pcs ?
[12:13] <iLogical> in my homes
[12:14] <iLogical> between a notebook and a desktop
[12:14] <iLogical> I want it to sync with an external hard drive when I insert it
[12:14] <iLogical> is it possible?
[12:34] <mandel> iLogical, no, external hd and folders outside your home dir (mac/linux=> ~ windows =>C:\Users\youruser) is not supported
[12:35] <mandel> iLogical, mainly because it will break if you mount it with diff users
[12:35] <iLogical> ok
[12:35] <mandel> iLogical, you can use a udf, witch is syncing a folder that is not Ubuntu One,  for example ~/Music
[12:36] <mandel> iLogical, and it will only sync if you really want to in all the devices, so if the netbook hds is not big enough you just dont sync ~/music
[12:44] <iLogical> is it a good idea to sync the .xchat2/ of this irc client?
[12:53] <mandel> iLogical, you might get conflicts if you have xchat opened in two machines...
[12:53] <mandel> iLogical, but you certainly can
[13:20] <iLogical> can I prioritize what is being synced? mandel
[13:20] <iLogical> i want my music folder to be synced first
[13:20] <mandel> iLogical, no, that is a feature that we do not have (Although I'd love to have it)

[14:56] <hallyn> Is there a way to delete my tomboy notes from ubuntu one servers?  (oen is corrupt, and preventing syncing fromall devices now)
[14:57] <mandel> rye, ^
[15:13] <rye> hallyn: have you tried running the note fix script?
[15:13] <rye> sorry for delayed response
[15:13] <rye> http://people.canonical.com/~roman.yepishev/us/tomboy-sync-validator.py
[15:17] <hallyn> rye: errors were found in 2 documents
[15:18] <hallyn> 3a2ce419-7457-4282-bedf-8239b5cb1f79: xml_text
[15:18] <hallyn> and another note has
[15:18] <hallyn> 385619a9-b67f-4b75-b6db-67ac07463a1e: datetime_format
[15:19] <hallyn> I'm assuming they  happened when I tried changing notes from (effing) android
[15:19] <rye> hallyn: you can run tomboy-sync-validator.py --fix to have it fixed
[15:27] <hallyn> rye: awesome, thanks!  (running now)
[15:28] <hallyn> failed with:  {"error":"unauthorized","reason":"Authentication required."}
[15:28] <alo21> hi.. I would like to fix bugs, but most of them are assigned to Ubuntu One Client Engineering Team. Does this mean I can't fix the but in anyway?
[15:29] <hallyn> rye: I'll have to look at it later.  thanks again.
[15:30] <rye> hallyn: interesting, OAuth tokens not working? Could you please run http://people.canonical.com/~roman.yepishev/us/ubuntuone-tomboy-update-auth.py ?

[15:39] <hallyn> rye: now it succeeds.  but it finds two errors every time
[15:40] <hallyn> (bbl)
[15:42] <rye> hallyn: even after calling it with --fix ?
[15:42] <karni> alo21: hi. no, it means someone (or the team itself) has assigned that bug to the team, but we are always happy to accept contributions to our open source clients
[15:43] <karni> alo21: You can bzr branch the project, fix it, bzr commit, and bzr push lp:~your_username/project_name_on_lp/branch_name
[15:43] <alo21> karni, ah.. OK. Thanks
[15:43] <karni> alo21: With that, we can review the code and decide whether to merge it to trunk.
[15:45] <dobey> alo21: u1 does require contributor agreements, so you'll need to fill the form and submit it, if you haven't already
[15:56] <karni> dobey: To any of our clients?

[16:58] <iLogical> mandel, I renamed some folders inside my desktop and it's no syncing at all
[16:58] <iLogical> with the notebook, i tried reconnect
[16:58] <iLogical> didn't work
[16:58] <mandel> iLogical, uhm.. did you sync ~/Desktop?
[16:59] <iLogical> no
[16:59] <iLogical> I put everything inside the /home/Ubuntu One
[16:59] <iLogical> so that I can keep more control over what i want to share
[17:00] <mandel> iLogical, oh, then you might have to wait, or look at the desktop and check what is going on..
[17:00] <mandel> iLogical, take into account that the files have to be uploaded..
[17:01] <iLogical> won't they just be renamed?
[17:01] <iLogical> I didn't add anything new, or deleted, i just renamed some folders
[17:02] <mandel> iLogical, hm.. weird.. that should be super fast
[17:02] <mandel> rye, can you help  iLogical while I'm away, the dog needs the afternoon walk or else the carpet will need the afternoon cleaning
[17:04] <iLogical> no need guys
[17:04] <iLogical> I renamed the files manually

[20:11] <Josse> Hello, guys. So several weeks ago, I thought I had lost my computer, so i went into the ubuntu-one website to deactivate the device (so whoever found my laptop couldn't delete my stored files).
[20:12] <Josse> Now I have found my computer but I can't arrive to get ubuntu-one to connect again.
[20:12] <Josse> Anyone kind enough to help me out?
[20:15] <chaselivingston> Josse: do you receive an error when trying to sign in?
[20:16] <Josse> Yes, chaselivingston.
[20:16] <chaselivingston> Josse: what is the error?
[20:16] <Josse> File sync error: Auth_failed
[20:16] <Josse> This is displayed in the ubuntu one config app.
[20:17] <dobey> Josse: can you swtich to the "devices" tab?
[20:17] <karni> chaselivingston: Hrm. Didn't hally-n have a smiliar issue today?
[20:17] <Josse> "sorry an error has ocured, ubuntu one needs to close.
[20:17] <chaselivingston> karni: maybe so, i didn't really get in on that conversation
[20:18] <Josse> And the details it gives me "unauthorised error" uhost requires auth, invalid access token.
[20:19] <Josse> But then It doesn't close... it enters to the devices tab and shows only  Local Device.
[20:19] <dobey> Josse: can you click "remove" on the devices tab?
[20:20] <dobey> Josse: is this on Ubuntu, Windows, or OS X, on your laptop?
[20:20] <Josse> I can. but I get the same error that ubuntu-one has to close
[20:20] <Josse> and then It doesn nothing.
[20:20] <Josse> this is on Lubuntu, dobey
[20:21] <Josse> But when I click remove, the details of the error are "Attribute error,  Qgroup object has no attribute 'startswith'"
[20:21] <dobey> that's weird
[20:21] <dobey> and likely a bug
[20:23] <Josse> :/
[20:23] <dobey> Josse: if you open the "Passwords and Keys" app (seahorse) and remove the "Ubuntu One" entry, and open ubuntuone-control-panel-qt again, does it work?
[20:24] <Josse> dobey, I don't have such app.
[20:24] <Josse> Should I install it?
[20:24] <dobey> do you have gnome-keyring installed?
[20:24] <Josse> This yes,,.
[20:25] <dobey> i guess probably so. yes you should install seahorse so you can manage the entries in your keyring
[20:25] <Josse> alright: Installing...
[20:28] <Josse> dobey, I did it, and now I get the sign in screen....
[20:29] <Josse> Is it possible to get sync errors because i've updated some files with other computers?
[20:30] <dobey> if there are conflicts it should write another file as filename.conflict on the machine, and you can choose which one is the correct version to use
[20:30] <Josse> perfect! So I'll do it. I'll let you know how it works out.
[20:31] <Josse> Should I somehow file a bug?
[20:33] <dobey> about the auth error issue?
[20:33] <Josse> Yeah.
[20:33] <Josse> After signing it, it's been "Getting informationg, please wait" for a pretty long while.
[20:34] <dobey> just press the "Next" button
[20:37] <Josse> Heh, it's working like a charm!!!!!
[20:37] <Josse> Perfet!
[20:38] <Josse> Now that I'm here, I'd like to thank all the people working on ubuntu-one. I think it's one of the coolest features of ubuntu. Thanks!
[20:40] <dobey> thank you

[23:34] <titoto> I am trying to develop an app for U1, I have a peculiar problem: files which size is beyond around 17Kb fail to upload, (status code 500)
[23:34] <titoto> Any hint as to why?
[23:41] <ali1234> well i assume 500 is http 500 aka "generic server error"
[23:42] <ali1234> so i would look carefully at the traffic between app and server and try to identify exactly where it fails
[23:42] <titoto> But i checked and it affects consistently files which are larger than somewhere around 17KB, so I am wondering if there is a different method than using a PUT to upload larger files
[23:42] <ali1234> try to find exactly how many bytes it fails on?
[23:42] <titoto> all the files under ~17KB succeeded, all the ones above failed
[23:43] <ali1234> make a file exactly 17kb and try to upload it?
[23:43] <titoto> ok, one sec
[23:43] <ali1234> then try 18kb
[23:43] <ali1234> then 17.5kb etc
[23:45] <ali1234> which API are you using to store the files?
[23:45] <ali1234> "cloud"?
[23:45] <titoto> https://files.one.ubuntu.com/content
[23:46] <titoto> yes, cloud
[23:47] <titoto> I think the problem might have to do with the way Go works internally... I can picture a buffer of 16384 being internally used for file io..
[23:48] <ali1234> hmm
[23:48] <ali1234> never used go
[23:48] <ali1234> i wouldn't expect file buffer to be visible that way though
[23:48] <titoto> I will investigate further, I just wondered if there was something useful I wasn't aware regarding uploading, and since it appears not, most likely I dont understand what is going on inside Go
[23:49] <ali1234> are you setting Content-Length properly on the headers?
[23:49] <titoto> yes
[23:49] <ali1234> i would use wireshark to watch what is actually getting sent on the wire
[23:49] <ali1234> some http libraries like to mess with the headders on requests
[23:50] <titoto> ok, I will take your advice and install wireshark
[23:50] <titoto> thanks
