[03:07] <TheLordOfTime> correct me if i'm wrong, but  wouldn't this fall under the scope of bash-completion?

[03:07] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1095180 in etckeeper (Ubuntu) "incorrect bash-completion" [Undecided,New]
[03:25] <yofel> TheLordOfTime: etckeeper ships its own bash-completion file so no
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[12:42] <pedro_> happy new year folks :-)
[14:17] <hggdh> ding-o-bell pedro_
[14:19] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: bash-completion indeed
[14:20] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: oops. If, as yofel says, etckeeper has its own bash completion script, then it is there
[14:20]  * hggdh should read the backlog in full
[14:50] <pedro_> hggdh: happy new year!
[14:52] <hggdh> :-)
[16:03] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, hggdh, OK, wasn't sure, but its missing apport information, should we ask them to apport-collect for the bug?
=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
[16:36] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: etckeeper does not have an apport hook, so all that the OP needs to do is state the UBuntu and etckeeper version (lsb_release -a and dpkg -l etckeeper\*)
[16:37] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: and a delicate nudge to use ubuntu-bug next time
