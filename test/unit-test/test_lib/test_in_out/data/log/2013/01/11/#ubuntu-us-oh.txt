[00:58] <gilbert> kinda crazy actually
[00:58] <paultag> yeah?
[00:58] <gilbert> always seemed like it was super far off
[00:59] <gilbert> but its awesome
[00:59] <paultag> :D
[00:59] <gilbert> so yeah lots going on
[00:59] <paultag> totally :D
[01:00] <paultag> How's the PhD?

[01:00] <paultag> Nice!
[01:00] <paultag> Dr. Gilbert!
[01:00] <gilbert> yeah, that too
[01:00] <gilbert> also weird, but cool
[01:00] <paultag> Dr. Gilbert, Married man.
[01:01] <gilbert> yeah, alternative universe
[01:01] <paultag> :)
[01:01] <gilbert> anyway, huge relief now getting all the big stuff in life done
[01:01] <paultag> hahaha, I bet! :)
[01:02] <paultag> so, the big question
[01:02] <paultag> what next?
[01:02] <gilbert> did i ever tell you about psidef?
[01:02] <paultag> nope :)
[01:03] <gilbert> it's a security/computer security consulting company that i started last year
[01:03] <gilbert> so gonna be working on getting that going for the immediate future
[01:03] <paultag> kickass!
[01:03] <paultag> that's pretty amazing
[01:03] <gilbert> yea, exciting times
[01:03] <paultag> you're a machine, gilbert!
[01:04] <gilbert> i dunno about that, but perhaps
[01:04] <gilbert> robo-gilbert
[01:04] <paultag> hahaha
[01:04] <gilbert> anyway i've got some services running on psidef.org, but what i really need to do is work on the html.  kinda plain now :(
[01:05]  * paultag loads
[01:05] <paultag> hahahahahaha
[01:05] <paultag> that's true :)
[01:06] <gilbert> anyway, the web front will be more for sales purposes anyway, and i haven't had time to actually take jobs if they were coming in, but that should be changing
[01:06] <paultag> totally.
[01:08] <gilbert> what r u up to lately paultag?
[01:09] <paultag> gilbert: still @ sunlight, busy as hell, but really fun. Flying out to CLE to talk @ Carroll on feb 6th, working on some Debian stuff. Wrote a lisp variant I'm talking about on the 24th here in BOS fully hosted in Python
[01:09] <paultag> gilbert: lots of code, not much change.
[01:09] <gilbert> good stuff
[01:10] <gilbert> lisp is something i have yet to find myself wanting to learn
[01:10] <paultag> aye
[01:10] <paultag> gilbert: it's macro system is a selling point (it's natrual for lisp to process lisp code)
[01:11] <paultag> so it gets handed lexed but not eval'd code in it's natrual list form, and it can return the tree after it digests it
[01:11] <gilbert> i get urges to look at haskel every now, and then but lose interest quickly when i run through tutorials examples that are (to me) incredibly ugly
[01:11] <paultag> aye
[01:12] <paultag> if you want to see my slides, I can send you my pre-talk copy
[01:12] <paultag> (I've got it up now)
[01:13] <gilbert> i've had crazy thoughs lately about working on a python variant
[01:13] <paultag> yeah?
[01:13] <gilbert> yeah, just thoughts about a few things that i don't like that i have ideas on doing better
[01:14] <paultag> iiinteresting
[01:14] <paultag> like what (out of wonderment)
[01:14] <gilbert> i've been meaning to write a list down.  some things that aren't coming to me right away
[01:15] <paultag> np
[01:15] <gilbert> yeah, i'd take a look at the slides
[01:15] <paultag> I'll send them in /query (I like keeping them private before a talk)
[01:15] <gilbert> sure
[01:16] <paultag> gilbert: the two-pane layout is a "repl" - left is lisp, right is Python, feel free to edit the left in-slide
