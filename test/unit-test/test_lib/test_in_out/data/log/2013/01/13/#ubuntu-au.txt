[03:17] <mesquka> Hi
[06:43] <sagaci> mesquka: hi
[09:23] <mesquka> Hi
[09:57] <sagaci> anyone around for the meeting..
[10:11] <jea> sagaci: we didn't really schedule it properly
[10:12] <jea> Maybe we should set dates for the 2013 meetings, and get things going properly
[10:12] <jea> the main issue is that we don't have anything to really talk about
[10:18] <sagaci> yep
[10:18] <jea> will you or will I make the meetings in l.u.c?
[10:24] <sagaci> you can if you feel like it
[10:25] <jea> Ok, I will get that done soon
[11:10] <head_victim> Sorry all, I thought the meeting was due next week. Thanks sagaci and jea for showing though.
[11:13] <jea> head_victim: I guess today would be the correct date, but I had forgotten also
[11:17] <head_victim> I don't know about you but this week's been crazy. Started back at work, started back at uni (first assessment due tomorrow) and now I forgot this :/
[11:21] <jea> Wow, that is a lot. Luckily I am still on holidays, but I have started back at work again
[11:22] <head_victim> I see we've had some other vocals join the channel recently. Friend of yours or just from here?
