[10:56] <ttoine> hello
[11:18] <zequence> ttoine: hi
[11:19] <ttoine> zequence,, what's up ?
[11:21] <zequence> ttoine: Cleaning, at home. I've been throwing away stuff for the whole year, and it seems I have nothing else to throw now. It's a nice feeling when the idea of sorting everything you own seems like a piece of cake
[11:23] <zequence> I've come to realize it's very important for me to have a minimal amount of objects in my home. Otherwise, like in Chinese Feng Shui, if your home surrounding is in bad shape, your mind will be in bad shape
[11:24] <zequence> And my home quickly becomes chaotic, if I don't keep things simple
[11:25] <zequence> plus, someone called me today asking me to come to a job interview
[11:25] <zequence> So, that felt ok
[11:25] <zequence> It's better when companies chase you, and not the other way around :P
[11:32] <zequence> ttoine: How's your baby doing?
[11:44] <jussi> zequence: job interviews are nice. what do you do? 
[11:45] <zequence> jussi: Until now, I've been mostly doing hard labour, but I'm kind of moving towards IT. There seems to be a big interest for qualified Linux admins
[11:46] <zequence> Sorry, manual labour
[11:46] <jussi> hehe
[11:47]  * jussi imagines zequence in the salt mines... :P
[11:47] <zequence> Well, I did work in cold warehouses for a while, -25 C
[11:48] <zequence> But, salt mines are probably a bit worse :)
[12:17] <jussi> hehe
[13:34] <astraljava> Hard labour is what midwives do, no?
[13:59] <ttoine> zequence, hehe, I agree, always better when company chase you
[14:15] <ttoine> astraljava, ?

[14:58] <scott-work> good morning
[14:58]  * scott-work had trouble with logging onto webchat this morning
[18:29] <scott-work> it is quite in here today
[19:06] <zequence> scott-work: I'd say it quite often is :).
[19:19] <scott-work> micahg: re: bug #1066401, would updating the desktop meta to include photography and publishing metas be a viable options for precise? would this be an SRU?
[19:19] <ubottu> bug 1066401 in ubuntustudio-meta (Ubuntu) "distribution upgrade to 12.10 omits two metas" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1066401
[19:19] <scott-work> zequence: that's kinda sad, maybe i can help that
[19:19] <scott-work> oh, this reminds me, someone emailed me about helping with studio and i told him, among other things, to come onto irc
[19:19]  * scott-work is looking up his name
[19:19] <zequence> scott-work: I don't feel we do too little talking myself
[19:20] <scott-work> james jordin is his name
[19:20] <zequence> Nice
[19:20] <zequence> We need more people who have more time to do the work. There aren't that much we need to talk about as it is now, I feel
[19:21] <zequence> We're on course with things, but we need to get them done too
[19:21] <zequence> Tons of stuff I have yet to do for this cycle
[19:23] <zequence> Just looking at the team structure tells you that the same names turn up in way too many teams
[19:24] <zequence> We have more teams than developers
[19:24] <zequence> That's kind of funny, when you think about it
[19:24] <zequence> It's like the plummer you meet at the hotel. He's also the bellboy, and the manager/owner
[19:24] <scott-work> absolutely, it is
[19:26] <zequence> No absolute disaster, if US stays in it's current shape. It works. It does its job. Of course, it could be enhanced in so many ways
[19:27] <scott-work> *sigh* so true
[19:33] <micahg> scott-work: well, technically, I think that's new feature stuff...but it might fly
[19:34] <micahg> that won't fix the users who have already upgraded though
[19:34] <scott-work> micahg: understood about people who have upgraded already
[19:35] <scott-work> micahg: i would presume my next step is to update the seeds and file an SRU?
[19:35] <micahg> you might want to ask the SRU team if they mind, it shouldn't be a problem to cherry pick the fixes to get it on the precise ISOs
[19:36] <scott-work> i'll see if i can find a few SRU team members on IRC and ask them :)
