[15:42] <jirido> Hi.. Can anyone tip me of for info on how to change color in the digital clock in lxpanel?
[15:43] <jirido> I found it!
[17:40] <billytwowilly> pretty impressive work lubuntu guys
[22:25] <genoobie> hey all
[22:38] <genoobie> was debating whether to use xubuntu or lubuntu
[22:45] <mathi> hi, I edited crontab with crontab -e, now are the crontabs automatically launched ?
[22:49] <gomiboy> mathi: yes, cron checks every minute if there is something to do
[22:50] <mathi> can I use a bash file ?
[22:50] <mathi> it doesn't work .. :(
[22:50] <gomiboy> mathi: if you have cron running, that is :)
[22:51] <mathi> well i edited crontab -e, and I rebooted
[22:51] <mathi> it should be running ?
[22:51] <gomiboy> run this to check: ps ax | grep cron
[22:54] <mathi> i see cron running
[22:56] <gomiboy> mathi: ok, now, is your bash script executable? if it's not: chmod +x /your/script
[22:58] <mathi> gomiboy, if I modify my crontab, i need to reboot computer to reload the file ?
[22:59] <gomiboy> no, as said cron will check the crontab every minute to see if there is somethin to do
[23:01] <mathi> gomiboy, ok, I created a bash script that launches Teamviewer
[23:01] <genoobie> hey all
[23:01] <mathi> gomiboy, if I launch it from command line, it works perfectly
[23:01] <mathi> gomiboy, but if cron tries to execute it
[23:01] <genoobie> hardware support in lubuntu vs xubuntu should be the same, correct?
[23:01] <mathi> Teamviewer won't launch
[23:01] <mathi> gomiboy, any idea why ?
[23:03] <gomiboy> mathi: Teamviewer is something like vnc? a remote graphic terminal?
[23:03] <mathi> gomiboy, yes
[23:03] <mathi> why the cron would fail to laod it ?
[23:03] <gomiboy> genoobie: yes, same kernel, same hardware support
[23:04] <gomiboy> mathi: because cron runs as root and doesn't know nothing about the user you are logged in as, nor about your X environment, etc...
[23:05] <mathi> gomiboy, so what's the solution to this ? :-)
[23:06] <mathi> gomiboy, indeed, how can I launched it on behalf of a specific user ??
[23:09] <gomiboy> mathi: try in your script something like: su - yourusername -c /path/to/teamviewer
[23:09] <gomiboy> but i don't know if it will be sufficient...
[23:26] <gomiboy> mathi: i made some tests, just use this: DISPLAY=:0 /path/to/teamviewer
[23:30] <mathi> gomiboy, for some reason, cron can't execute the command
[23:30] <mathi> gomiboy, it works with su - <username>
[23:30] <mathi> but only from command line
[23:30] <mathi> strange
[23:38] <gomiboy> mathi: something else is wrong... check the logs: tail /var/log/syslog
[23:52] <gomiboy> mathi: it's late here, my bed is calling me, someone else will help you. bye :)
[23:52] <mathi> see you, thank you for the help
