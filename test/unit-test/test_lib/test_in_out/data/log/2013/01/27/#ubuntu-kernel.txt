[00:42] <infinity> ikepanhc: I guess I don't get metas afterall?
[00:43] <infinity> ikepanhc: (This is what I meant by "if you upload them all at once, you don't have to babysit", cause I could be promoting and moving this mess along by now)

[01:43] <ikepanhc> infinity: just uploaded, shall be done in any minutes.
[01:44] <ikepanhc> infinity: fall to sleep too early yesterday :p
[01:54] <infinity> ikepanhc: My clock's completely backward.
[02:13] <infinity> ikepanhc: Ack.  You still there?
[02:13] <infinity> ikepanhc: You dropped the changes from the last upload in your quantal meta.
[02:13] <infinity> ikepanhc: err, precise, I mean.
[02:14] <ikepanhc> infinity: eh... let me check again
[02:14] <infinity> https://launchpadlibrarian.net/129646059/linux-meta-armadaxp_3.2.0.1613.19_3.2.0.1614.19.diff.gz
[02:14] <ikepanhc> infinity: eh, you are right, give me another 10min
[02:14] <infinity> ^-- That should have been 3.2.0.1614.20 and included the changes from 3.2.0.1613.19
[02:18] <infinity> Hrm, it could be that Andy forgot to commit that revision to git.  That would do it.
[02:19] <ikepanhc> I will replay it. Just 10min
[02:30] <ikepanhc> uploaded, wait ppa finishing package verify
[02:31] <infinity> ikepanhc: Would have more sense to keep Andy's previous changelog, and then just do your version bump on top, but oh well.
[02:34] <infinity> ikepanhc: Other than the changelog being weird, this at least produces the same source and binaries, so I'm happy enough with it.
[02:35] <ikepanhc> infinity: is there any guidebook for debian packaging? I am starting to think it would be better if I can read it
[02:36] <infinity> ikepanhc: Well, I'm not sure a guide book here would have helped, it's just common courtesy to not wipe out a previous changelog entry. :)
[02:36] <infinity> (In this case, I doubt Andy cares about attribution, so the diff is just "weird", rather than anything else)
[02:37] <ikepanhc> yes, that's what confusing me, since we have two .1614.19 in changelog. that will make changelog weird in any way
[02:42] <infinity> Well, my suggestion would have been to just include Andy's change, and then change your version to 1614.20, dropping the 1614.19 change entirely.
[02:42] <infinity> But too late now.
[02:42] <infinity> Since you can't reuse 1614.20, and doing ANOTHER upload just to twiddle the changelog more is pretty pointless.
[02:43] <ikepanhc> infinity: btw, thanks for the review. I am glad that you let me know that I shall review the diff after upload
[02:46] <infinity> ikepanhc: s/after/before/
[02:46] <infinity> ikepanhc: Please. :P
[02:47] <infinity> ikepanhc: Grab the old source, and "debdiff old.dsc new.dsc"
[02:47] <ikepanhc> understood.
[02:47] <infinity> After is a little late, especially in the case of "oops, I did something weird and now I can't reuse that version number, so I get to have a strange changelog that documents my mistakes or mysteriously skips version numbers to hide them". :)
[02:48] <infinity> So, for the sake of buildd resources and your own pride, review diffs before upload. :)
[02:48]  * ikepanhc nods
[02:48] <ikepanhc> I can not agree more
[02:49] <infinity> People staging in PPAs actually get it a bit rougher here.
[02:49] <infinity> Cause once you've uploaded to the PPA, the version is used up, and the package has eaten a few buildds.
[02:49] <infinity> People uploading directly to $stable-proposed get to have me yell at them from a queue review, and I can reject the package and they can redo it as if it never existed.
