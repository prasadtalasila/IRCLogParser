[03:12] <the_hydra> hi all
[03:12] <the_hydra> Unity in Ubuntu 12.10 doesn't recognize my mouse gesture
[03:13] <the_hydra> fyi, my laptop is produced circa early 2008
[03:13] <the_hydra> from Xorg.log, it says "double triple" which, according to Debian wiki, confirms that my touchpad recognizes up to 3 fingers press
[03:14] <the_hydra> what could I do further to test?
[03:54] <the_hydra> anyone can help?
