[00:00] <mojtaba> Do I need to do something before that?
[00:00] <keelG> an pop3/imap email client or just send an email with smtp?
[00:00] <mojtaba> I just got dead.letter in my home directory
[00:01] <mojtaba> I want to send it via my gmail
[00:01] <mojtaba> keelG: I just want to use my gmail account
[00:01] <mojtaba> I guess it is imap.
[00:01] <keelG> mojtaba: Im afraid I have no expereince with a cmdline based email client or any other client which will allow you to do that. However It wouldnt surprise me it existed :)

[00:03] <JPeterson> how do i mov ethe unity launch bar to the bottom?
[00:03] <dr_willis> JPeterson:  short answer.. you dont./
[00:03] <k1l_> JPeterson: that is not ment to happen
[00:04] <keelG> Mark Shuttleworth is slightly "Steve Jobs" when it comes to the unity bar
[00:04] <dr_willis> there used to be unofficial and crashy mods/hacks one could use.. but not seen those mentioned in ages.
[00:04] <mojtaba> keelG: I will take a look. thanks
[00:04] <RollinV2> keelG, slightly? lol
[00:04] <k1l_> if you want unity not to be like unity, just dont use unity. thats it :/
[00:04] <keelG> I was only putting it mildly ;)
[00:04] <dr_willis> you can always run some other docks if you wanted
[00:04] <vulte> hello all, I edited /etc/fstab so it would auto mount a CIFS network volume.. with the line for that CIFS volume, the system hangs on boot due to CIFS being unable to mount the network share. is there some way to delay the mount until some point later in boot?
[00:05] <dr_willis> along with unity
[00:05] <keelG> Yea, make unity autohide and run AWN or docky or whatever
[00:05] <Noskcaj> is it possible to use opencl with the mesa drivers?
[00:05] <RollinV2> they won't even let unity be docked to the right or bottom edge of the screen. its beyond a slap in the face to customization.
[00:05] <JPeterson> neither were you
[00:05] <dr_willis> vulte:  i think theres some waiting option for cifs.  or just set it to noauto , then mount it from rc.local after some delay so you know the system is up and ready
[00:05] <RollinV2> plank is good dock.
[00:06] <k1l_> RollinV2: before going to judge read about the history of the gnome2. :/
[00:06] <dr_willis> ive seen more issues with users messing things up with their customizations  then i want to mention...
[00:06] <keelG> Plank looks awesome
[00:07] <vulte> dr_willis: is noauto an argument i can put in the share's line in /etc/fstab?
[00:07] <dr_willis> vulte:  yes.
[00:07] <RollinV2> k1l_, gnome2 was forked too much. i get it. doesn't excuse unity's complete lack of customization options.

[00:08] <IveBeenBit> I am having problems installing Ubuntu in a dual boot with Windows 7. The partition editor does not recognize any of my hard drives, and then the installer crashes. Does anyone feel like helping me in #ubuntu-beginners?
[00:08] <k1l_> RollinV2: no, there is a very famous citation from linus torvalds about the customizations from gnome2.
[00:08] <keelG> bakers: I normally wouldn't mind helping out the next guy with his pet project. But why don't you test your code yourself
[00:08] <k1l_> so judging unity in that way is not to be true about the gnome2 itself.
[00:09] <RollinV2> i've read linus option on gnome3. never saw his gnome2 rants.
[00:09] <bakers> keelG: I tested it on fedora, and I want an ubuntu test
[00:09] <bakers> keelG: I'm testing if the binary I made is cross distro compatible
[00:09] <keelG> bakers: I get that, why not just live ubuntu and test it?

[00:16] <keelG> RollinV2:  Yea. From what I could tell they forked with Ubuntu Tweak and are trying to package it slightly more userfriendly. Beats CSSM thats for sure!
[00:16] <allan_> anyone here willing to help out a linux noob?
[00:17] <keelG> allan_:  if you state your problem, with adequate details I am certain someone will :)
[00:18] <RollinV2> use paste.ubuntu.com if your problem is multiline
[00:19] <allan_> in the ubuntu software center the buttons and words keep glitching. it seems the glitch is only visual, but its rather annoying and I dont know anything about linux to fix it
[00:19] <tronnix> are you running a live distro?
[00:19] <tronnix> or installed?
[00:19] <allan_> no
[00:19] <allan_> I am dual booting however.
[00:19] <chamunks> I'm slightly concerned about this output http://puu.sh/1T9dU  can someone make sure I'm not worried over nothing.
[00:20] <allan_> installed.
[00:20] <chamunks> the output is apt-get response to an install I'm trying to run http://puu.sh/1T9dU
[00:20] <tronnix> install synaptic package manager, and use software center minimally
[00:21] <allan_> also I am having some issues getting steam to install. Im using 12.10
[00:21] <keelG> allan_: what tronnix said - however, does the problem exist in a Guest session or if you login as another user?

[00:34] <waspinator> doesn't show up in FF 18.0.1
[00:34] <waspinator> but it does on windows ...
[00:34] <hipitihop> waspinator, ok on 17.01 linux

[00:36] <jrib> hanlond: yes, and there's also #ubuntu-server.  Either channel is fine
[00:36] <k1l_> hanlond: you can ask here. but there is #ubuntu-server, too
[00:36] <hipitihop> waspinator, sorry too quick a nd was running a windows vb here, meant to say, ff 18.0.1 on windows is ok
[00:36] <k1l_> jrib: *5* :)
[00:36] <jrib> k1l_: at least I'm fairly certain I've said the right thing now ;)
[00:36] <waspinator> ya works for me on windows too...
[00:37] <hipitihop> waspinator, but it is also fine on 18.0.1 on buntu (lts)
[00:38] <waspinator> I'm on 12.10 x32. strange
[00:39] <keelG> waspinator: also ok on 12.10@ff18.01 - if its the "tear footer" thing
[00:42] <waspinator> oh doh! I'm just an idiot. I have two screens 1920x1080 and 1920x1200, and when I moved my FF window from the bigger one to the smaller one it looked like it was full screen but it wasn't. the bottom was just being cut off

[00:45] <Cyber_Akuma> I assume since nvidia's drivers are binaries they won't be avaliable in teh reposotories

[00:47] <dbrom> hello all. question: I would like to compress my files and use as little space as I can. I am using tar at the moment but when I use tar.gz I have been told that there is a change that i can loose data ... whats my options
[00:47] <escott> dbrom, tar doesnt compress and no
[00:47] <josesierra> Hello... I have a recurring issue that I hope someone can help me troubleshoot.
[00:47] <keelG> tar is a container, and doesn't compress
[00:47] <dbrom> Cyber_Akuma: : are you using a gui
[00:47] <josesierra> My connection to the internet is intermittent.  Every couple of minutes it stops loading pages or connecting...
[00:48] <josesierra> then after a few seconds it reconnects
[00:48] <josesierra> well, more like thirty seconds
[00:48] <dbrom> when I make a tar ball its not compressed
[00:48] <josesierra> I'm using wireless right now, but it happens even if the connection is wired...
[00:48] <keelG> josesierra: does it happen on another machine as well?
[00:48] <josesierra> it's super annoying, and it happens all the dang time.
[00:49] <escott> dbrom, usually when someone says tarball they mean a tar.gz/tgz file which is compressed but a plain tar archive is not compressed
[00:49] <josesierra> keelG, I have several machines on this network.  It happens on my laptop as well (ubuntu) but it doesn't happen on the two windows machines on the network
[00:49] <josesierra> the two windows machines, one is wired and one is wireless, and they don't have any issues (aside from being windows, of course)
[00:50] <keelG> josesierra: does the network disconnect if you run ping to 8.8.8.8 i.e.?
[00:50] <josesierra> my other ubuntu laptop has the same issue but I've only tried connecting via wireless.
[00:51] <josesierra> keelG, lemme check
[00:51] <keelG> josesierra: do you see the network reconnecting in the top panel?
[00:51] <josesierra> keelG, negative.  there's no visual indication of the issue.
[00:52] <keelG> josesierra: run the ping
[00:52] <josesierra> keelG, just pinged 8.8.8.8 and it's pinging pretty consistently at 30-40ms... with a bump to 160ms once in a while
[00:52] <keelG> but no disconnects?
[00:52] <josesierra> negative
[00:52] <keelG> are you using google chrome or chromium browsers by any chance?
[00:53] <josesierra> yes I am...
[00:53] <Jpmh> usually when I install from my usb stick it offers me the choice of install side-by-side with Windoze - on Compaqs it does not - is this because they set the partition table too small?
[00:53] <josesierra> chrome
[00:53] <josesierra> I have the issue with FF as well though...?
[00:53] <keelG> josesierra: I would guess its a DNS relates issue or an issue with dnsmasq
[00:53] <josesierra> (that was my first attempt at troubleshooting...)
[00:53] <escott> Jpmh, a lot of laptops are shipping these days with 4 primary partitions. you need to convert one to extended or delete one
[00:54] <josesierra> keelG, how can I fix it?
[00:54] <keelG> josesierra: are you using a local DNS server?
[00:55] <josesierra> keelG, not that I know of... I mean, no, I don't have a DNS running at my house
[00:55] <keelG> josesierra: check your DNS settings and try changing them to another knowgood
[00:55] <Jpmh> escott: that's what I suspected - do not really want to delete one - how can I convert one to an extended one?
[00:55] <Jpmh> escott: actually is there any way I can re-partition without damaging what is on there?
[00:56] <escott> Jpmh, yes. the easiest way is probably to install gdisk and then convert to gpt and then convert back to msdos
[00:56] <keelG> josesierra: if that still fails, we can try to disable dnsmasq
[00:56] <josesierra> keelG I hate to be this noobtastic, but I have no idea how to do that.  Wireless settings?
[00:56] <Jpmh> escott: can you point me at some instructions for beginners on that - I am linux competant but this is all new to me
[00:57] <keelG> josesierra: yes :) http://askubuntu.com/questions/2321/what-is-the-proper-way-to-change-the-dns-ip
[00:57] <josesierra> keelG: thank you!  attempting now...
[00:57] <escott> Jpmh, i dont know of any written instructions for this. it doesnt really matter what you do to the partition table as long as your end result has the partitions starting and ending at the same LBA
[00:58] <snow_> its your router thats the blame, check its settings
[00:58] <hanlond> #ubuntu-server
[00:59] <Jpmh> escott: what tool would I use to creat a new partition table then with more partitions - or for that matter to change one to an extended one.  If I change one to extended will Windoze object?
[00:59] <josesierra> keelG... I'm not sure what DNS to set it to?  Should I run DNS locally...?
[00:59] <escott> Jpmh, you can use whatever you want. parted, gdisk, sfdisk, gparted
[00:59] <keelG> josesierra: set it to 8.8.8.8 for testing (googles DNS)
[00:59] <escott> Jpmh, whatever you are comfortable with
[01:00] <josesierra> keelg: roger
[01:00] <Jpmh> escott: ty so much - I am comfortable with parted - but if I convert one of the existing partitions will Windoze complain?
[01:01] <escott> Jpmh, i dont think so but i dont know much about windows. i think it doesnt like to boot its main partition on an extended partition
[01:01] <keelG> Jpmh: Windoze just reads the partition table and displays your drives :)
[01:01] <Jpmh> escott: ty - I will make the "recovery" partition extended then
[01:02] <keelG> Jpmh: Unless something goes wrong that is ;)
[01:02] <escott> Jpmh, that would probably defeat the purpose of the partition
[01:02] <Jpmh> keelG: I want to do a side-by-side for someone who I think will change to ubuntu but dare not take away windoze immediately
[01:03] <escott> Jpmh, just give them a usb live system
[01:03] <escott> Jpmh, of setup a virtualbox system
[01:03] <keelG> that shouldn't be a problem - however I must admit I don't know what will happen if you move or change the recovery partition or if even grub is capable of detecting and adding a boot entry to this
[01:03] <josesierra> keelG wierdly enough, it seems to be working pretty darned good right now... no drops so far, and I would've had several drops in this amount of time
[01:04] <josesierra> and fast.  way faster than it was.
[01:04] <snow_> @jpmh; I am thinging that rezising is the only safest repartitioning you can do, but i think if you're talking about repartitioning that there is no way to test it out other that have a back up set else where for safety
[01:04] <josesierra> keelG thank you!!!
[01:04] <Jpmh> escott: the live usb is just too slow on a low-end compaq and the same thing for a virtual box - this is one of the reasons he should be using ubuntu
=== ben1u is now known as benlu
[01:05] <keelG> josesierra: np :) I dont know what is wrong in your network, that would cause this to be a problem only on your ubuntu boxes and not affect windows though
[01:05] <escott> Jpmh, i dont know why the liveusb would be much slower
[01:05] <Jpmh> escott: I occasionally run off the live usb - it is VERY slow compared to a real disk
[01:06] <hplc> the server version of ubuntu, how is bind set by default? to serve localhost? localdomain? or not set at all?
[01:06] <snow_> it's your usb port maybe
[01:06] <keelG> Jpmh: flashdrives have limitations in read IO, also if its old and used that could cause it to be slower than "normal"
[01:06] <Jpmh> snow_: I don't think so - the system even tells you that to run full speed install to hard disk
[01:07] <keelG> Jpmh: limitations in IO = drive vary in speeds :)
[01:07] <escott> Jpmh, that would be slow to start programs and boot, but it should be the same speed to run programs, unless you are concerned about boot performance
[01:07] <Jpmh> keelG: I think it may be the squashfs - but eitherway - him running that way is not the way to change him
[01:08] <Jpmh> escott: I agree - and it is slow boot and slow load of programs that I see - so we are on the same track
[01:08] <pravuz> Hey! Anyone else having issues with nvidia powermizer? Mine is on adaptive, but stuck on the highest performance level. my gpu is burning up:S
[01:09] <keelG> Jpmh: Are you comfortable with converting to GPT and UEFI booting? Then you can just make all partitions primary. However this might still break the MS recovery partition
[01:10] <Jpmh> keelG: I have absolutely no idea about GPT or UEFI - so probably no
[01:10] <escott> keelG, i dont think windows will boot if you convert
[01:10] <keelG> escott: point taken, dont listen to me Jpmh
[01:11] <keelG> or well
[01:11] <JPeterson> how do i change the `dpkg -l`desired state from purge to insatlled?
[01:11] <Jpmh> keelG: ty - and I appreciate the laugh I got from you telling me to igmore YOU
[01:11] <escott> keelG, that said converting to gpt and back was the way i first suggested keelG attack the problem its very easy to do
[01:12] <keelG> escott: I am actually almost certain windows doesnt care.. Since its GRUBs job to kick windows into starting up at that part of the boot process
[01:12] <allan_> does anyone know if Ubuntu is designed to properly take advantage of quad+ core processors?
[01:12] <Cyber_Akuma> I just did a fresh install of Ubuntu, and I dunno if this is normal or not, but it can't seem to tell when I am clicking on a window that is over another window. If I click an option for example and it opens a window, I can't click on anything in that window, it keeps clicking on the items that are beind that window
[01:13] <escott> keelG, no windows absolutely cares. its completely different
[01:13] <keelG> escott: also win7 is HAL independent, and I dont think its even changed, other than ACPI calls
[01:13] <escott> allan_, only version 2.0+
[01:13] <linuxman44> Cyber_Akuma, lol
[01:13] <linuxman44> bizzare stuff
[01:13] <allan_> >.> so 12.10 would be able to then?
[01:13] <keelG> escott: I wish I could put it to the test! :)
[01:13] <Cyber_Akuma> Look, no need to laugh, I haven't used ubuntu in a while
[01:13] <Cyber_Akuma> is that default behavior?
[01:14] <escott> keelG, the boot entry points for the kernel are completely different
[01:14] <Cyber_Akuma> it seems to lock mouse input to a certain window
[01:14] <Cyber_Akuma> and dosen't let me click on anything else
[01:14] <keelG> escott: arent those handled by GRUB?
[01:14] <felipe_Brz> i've downloaded some firmware in an attempt to solve a wireless card problem. Other than copying the .fw files into /lib/firmware/brcm, is there anything else I need to do in order to activate it????

[01:14] <escott> keelG, http://gitorious.org/tianocore_uefi_duet_builds/pages/Windows_x64_BIOS_to_UEFI
[01:16] <Cyber_Akuma> Is this a feature of the new UI or no?
[01:16] <waver> Hello all!
[01:16] <Jpmh> keelG:  and escott  ty - i have a spare machine I will test on

[01:21] <keelG> waver: is that your tail?
[01:21] <waver> that is a chunk from syslog yes

[01:22] <keelG> waver: do you have any fatal errors or such in dmesg?
[01:23] <waver> hmm don't believe so let me see
[01:23] <Jpmh> escott: ok - i have converted a test system using gdisk - added a partition - how do i convert back?
[01:23] <keelG> waver: reboot - I guess you hard boot it, by powering it on?
[01:23] <waver> yea :-\
[01:23] <escott> Jpmh, gdisk can convert both ways, one of the menu options will let you convert to and from gpt
[01:24] <escott> Jpmh, when you convert back just ask that gpt setup one of the partitions inside an extended
[01:24] <Jpmh> escott: I hit help and do not see it?

[01:30] <damselfly9> quality control isn't too good these days
[01:30] <keelG> waver: I have tried more than once, when I ran a smartctl on a new drive - only to find out, it wasnt new at all
[01:30] <waver> yea
[01:31] <waver> I actually did scan the drive using WD Diag util long tst
[01:31] <damselfly9> besides, all drives have bad sectors, it's just a question of whether they've been remapped
[01:31] <waver> tests showed the drive was ok
[01:31] <waver> hmm
[01:32] <damselfly9> on a scsi drive, it can actually tell you how many were bad from the factory
[01:32] <keelG> All drives still have these two tables, but I guess its vendor specifik how and if you can access both of these
[01:33] <keelG> cant recall if smartctl shows them

[01:35] <keelG> yea P-List and G-List: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_sector
[01:36] <damselfly9> still, I've had drives with bad sectors and it didn't instantly lock up the whole machine
[01:36] <keelG> that is true! However, I merely suggested him to boot a liveCD and test the disk, since he recently had it replaced :)

[01:37] <damselfly9> maybe trying the pci sata card waver mentioned?
[01:38] <waver> yup
[01:38] <waver> if it freezes again
[01:38] <waver> I am going to do that
[01:38] <keelG> When did it freeze?
[01:38] <keelG> @Live?
[01:38] <waver> hmm it has just randomly been freezing
[01:38] <waver> tailing syslog I just see something similar to what I sent via pastebin
[01:39] <damselfly9> waver, do you think there is any chance you might have accidently unseated some memory while changing the hdd?
[01:39] <keelG> or anything else for that matter :P
[01:41] <waver> hmmm damselfly9 that is possible
[01:41] <waver> perhaps the RAM isn't in all the way ;-) heh
[01:41] <waver> I will check it all
[01:41] <waver> I can say that all of the ram is showing up properly tho
[01:42] <keelG> Well, if you boot a LiveCD/USB the unseated memory would def. show as well ;)
[01:42] <Physicist> Hello fellas! Any device about install Steam on BackTrack 5 r3? I tried every little thing (almost probrably), but, appear that the archtecture is fail!!
[01:42] <damselfly9> I had some loose memory once. It survived 5 passes on memtest and then went crazy
[01:42] <waver> heh
[01:42] <keelG> Physicist: you know that BT5r3 is based on Ubuntu 10.04 right?
[01:43] <Physicist> Yes! And i'm doind a upgrading to 12.04..
[01:44] <keelG> Physicist: Then you might not experience any issues installing, but I am merely guessing ;)
[01:44] <Physicist> So keel G, can you say how can I do it?

[01:45] <manamana> is this as bad as it looks? http://i.imgur.com/9SPEGL4.jpg (HD failing SMART test)
[01:46] <Physicist> What mean?
[01:46] <damselfly9> yeah, failing a smart test is bad
[01:46] <escott> manamana, its worse than it loos
[01:46] <escott> looks
[01:46] <keelG> I wouldnt store my family vacation pictures on that drive, no
[01:46] <manamana> oh shit
[01:46] <damselfly9> time for backups
[01:47] <escott> keelG, its perfectly safe for him to take that disk out and stack printed photos on top of it.
[01:47] <keelG> escott: true, its perfectly safe as a paperwieght ;)
[01:47] <Physicist> Fellas, can I install Steam on Backtrack?
[01:47] <damselfly9> Physicist; didn't you say it didn't work?
[01:48] <keelG> I would think you would experience a lot of issues on a 10.04 based ubuntu distro - however maybe if you upgrade to 12.04, why dont you try? :)
[01:48] <manamana> luckily I just got a new 1 TB, does it still make sense to keep using the one who failed the test as backup?
[01:48] <escott> manamana, no its trash
[01:48] <manamana> :(
[01:48] <waver> manamana: how old is it?
[01:48] <waver> warranty replace?
[01:48] <Physicist> I just have finish upgrading to the 12.04 base, still cannot, but, maybe have one solution. Wine?
[01:48] <escott> manamana, disk failure isn't imminent. disk failure already occured
[01:48] <manamana> waver: less than a year
[01:48] <damselfly9> manamana; I would trust a drive that's ready to fail at any moment for backups
[01:49] <waver> warranty replace that thing!
[01:49] <waver> done
[01:49] <keelG> Physicist: if you have Steam in .deb format, you wont need wine
[01:49] <escott> manamana, always stress test new disks when you get them. don't just assume its good because its new
[01:49] <Physicist> I knoe keel G, remember of the i386 failure?
[01:49] <keelG> always stress test any electronics component when you just get it
[01:50] <keelG> well, maybe its because you are running 32bit and its 64bit or vice verse
[01:51] <Physicist> No, I have AMD 64 - a great machine, and this happened anway!
[01:51] <keelG> more on the "stress test subject" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burn-in
[01:52] <Physicist> kell G: my machine is 64bit, why that?
[01:52] <damselfly9> waver; does your machine have more than one sata controller (mine has two different ones, so I thought I'd ask)
[01:52] <waver> hmm damselfly9 I checked that
[01:52] <waver> just intel here
[01:52] <waver> older mobo can see the controllers here: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813127030
[01:53] <waver> controller*
[01:53] <damselfly9> ok. mine has two, one is pci-locked and the other isn't
[01:53] <keelG> waver: what damselfly9 just said got me thinking, its not one of these motherboards with a broken controller from intel?
[01:53] <keelG> ah p35
[01:53] <keelG> nvm
[01:53] <waver> oohhh hmm it is the Abit IP35 Pro
[01:53] <waver> mhm
[01:53] <waver> old old old
[01:53] <waver> :)
[01:53] <keelG> yea
[01:53] <waver> thinking of doing a rebuild
[01:53] <waver> but still squeezing some juice out of this one
[01:54] <damselfly9> a broken sata controller might tend to freeze things up
[01:54] <keelG> Try the LiveCD/USB first and check the disk meanwhile you test if crashes :)
[01:54] <waver> what's interesting is.... this seems to have just presented itself since adding this 3TB drive
[01:54] <waver> has been running with many 2TB drives for a long time
[01:54] <waver> no prob at all
[01:54] <Physicist> Bye guys! Thank a lot for nothing!
[01:54] <keelG> np
[01:55] <keelG> Hmmmmmmmm
[01:55] <keelG> Btw
[01:55] <keelG> How large is the parition?
[01:55] <waver> full drive umm 2.7TB
[01:55] <keelG> and you are using MBR?
[01:56] <keelG> ofc
[01:56] <keelG> hm
[01:56] <waver> GPT
[01:56] <damselfly9> if it's an old motherboard, it might have the old bios limitation of 2tb disks
[01:56] <keelG> narh
[01:56] <waver> have to for more than 2TB
[01:56] <keelG> exactly
[01:56] <escott> keelG, presumably he is using mbr+gpt
[01:56] <waver> yea
[01:56] <keelG> or that yes
[01:56] <waver> I believe just GPT but can't say for sure, used gparted
[01:57] <keelG> oh well, nvm then
[01:57] <keelG> Id still go with the liveCD test :)
[01:58] <waver> cool gotcha keelG
[01:58] <escott> waver, also do a ram test
[01:58] <moon`> you can't install a 64bit version of ubuntu on a 32 bit system yeah?  It just wouldn't run?
[01:58] <waver> gotcha, is Ram test something I can do while booted or do I need to boot something to test it
[01:58] <keelG> on a 32bit CPU? No
[01:58] <escott> moon`, correct. the other way around yes
[01:58] <waver> 64bit
[01:58] <moon`> I installed ubuntu on the wife's laptop off of a livecd I had and it's a 64 bit version that installed but I didn't realize her laptop had a 64 bit cpu
[01:59] <escott> waver, the livecd has a ram test option during boot
[01:59] <waver> ah yes
[01:59] <keelG> moon: You can install 32bit ubuntu on a 64bit CPU, np :)

[02:26] <subb1> I use ubuntu one service. But each time I add files to ubuntuone synced folder, I'll have to do System > Preferences > Ubuntuone , the click 'Connect' to start the sync. How to automate this? ie when a change is made to the folder, automatically it should get synced.
[02:26] <damselfly9> Physicist; or did you mean 11.04? that would only be 2 years old

[02:29] <damselfly9> Physicist; 12.04 is reasonably new
[02:29] <damselfly9> Physicist; people report less problems with 12.04 than with 12.10
[02:31] <Physicist> damselfly9: I know! I guess I will try upgrade and see what happened! But do you understand that I am using the newest backtrack? And this is a update from  the system not myself?

[02:33] <Physicist> Show a freaky window want update itself!
[02:33] <AGreyCrane> keelG: and fwiw, I have vda1 mounted fine (vda is raw on nfs, vdb is lvm on iscsi)
[02:33] <ongandrew> can anyone help me with that
[02:33] <damselfly9> Physicist; I don't know backtrack (I can't try every distro)

[02:34] <ongandrew> nope
[02:34] <ongandrew> just ubuntu

[02:37] <Physicist> Thank you fellas! Good day!!
[02:37] <escott> ongandrew, can you tell how far the boot gets? does ubuntu get loaded at all? does grub load?
[02:38] <ongandrew> after installing ubuntu it just says restart now or continue testing ubuntu right i clicked on the restart now then after that it would eject the cd and lets you press enter after pressing enter nothing happened
[02:38] <keelG> AGreyCrane: I must admit, I am way out of depth here - I have limited experience with iscsi and hardly any with LVM ,7
[02:38] <keelG> AGreyCrane: the only experience I had with LVM was that I couldn't get it to mount either :P
[02:38] <keelG> (crashed drive)
[02:38] <wb4bbc> DO a search on ROG website there is a whole thread on what you need to do
[02:40] <ongandrew> @wb4bbc you tanking to me?
[02:40] <wb4bbc> Yes
[02:40] <AGreyCrane> keelG: no worries, thanks for the input :) LVM is the underpining for the disk, but in the vm it just looks like a drive. I think it has something to do with advanced format (4k sector) drives. I'll figure it out
[02:40] <ongandrew> ROG?

[02:42] <ongandrew> i just pressed the power button to shut it down i have wait for about 30 mins but with no luck nothing happens just the ubuntu logo
[02:43] <escott> ongandrew, so after you power it back up you get the ubuntu logo for an extended time?>
[02:44] <ongandrew> nope after the reboot it goes on normally but it seems a little slow
[02:45] <ongandrew> after install the reboot screen just hanged and after i have restart my pc its all good i think but a bit slow
[02:45] <escott> ongandrew, so your complaint is what exactly? that the installer wasnt able to get the cpu to reboot?
[02:46] <escott> ongandrew, thats an annoyance but nothing to worry about. just means you have to manually powercycle the system or figure out the proper ACPI fixups to get reboot/halt to work correctly
[02:47] <damselfly9> it's terrible needing to press the power button :(
[02:47] <keelG> Good thing you wont need to reboot with Linux!!!!!!111one
[02:47] <ongandrew> how do i do that and aren't there files missing? caus it needed to restart thought there might be something missing through the installation process
[02:47] <keelG> did you see what I did there?
[02:48] <Cyber_Akuma> Well..... took me all of about 30 minutes to trash my Ubuntu installation
[02:48] <Cyber_Akuma> lovely
[02:48] <escott> ongandrew, x86 has never had a particularly well defined way to halt/reboot the system from software
[02:48] <ongandrew> you guys use ubuntu also right
[02:48] <ongandrew> i use x64
[02:49] <kris_therrien> can anyone help me i cant connect to my remote mysql database from ubuntu
[02:49] <damselfly9> ongandrew; yes, but I don't mind hitting the power button
[02:49] <escott> ongandrew, there are a bunch of strange techniques that may have different results on different systems. you'll probably want to look for instructions on selecting the write ACPI settings for your particular laptop anyways
[02:49] <ongandrew> won't that dmg your computer? i mean always force shut downing your computer like on windows your system could be dmg or corrupted
[02:50] <keelG> only if the OS is still running
[02:50] <escott> ongandrew, if you wait until it has halted and the OS isn't doing anything its fine
[02:50] <damselfly9> ongandrew; no, I shutdown then press the power button
[02:50] <Blacklite_> how do i remove this annoying bouncing icon when I start an app in kubuntu 12.04?
[02:50] <ongandrew> o ok
[02:50] <VictorVE> Ah! The magic of IRC
[02:50] <keelG> <3
[02:51] <ongandrew> whats the best stable verion of linux that is good for beginers like me
[02:51] <Cyber_Akuma> ... I told ubuntu to install to a usb flashdrive AND to install the bootloader to it
[02:51] <ongandrew> have 0 knowledge from linux
[02:51] <Cyber_Akuma> why did it still trash my windows bootloader?
[02:51] <escott> ongandrew, this is the ubuntu channel... so we will usually suggest that you start with gentoo :-P
[02:51] <damselfly9> ongandrew; free or non-free?
[02:51] <keelG> Cyber_Akuma: cause you need to install GRUB in its place?
[02:51] <Blacklite_> escott: lol
[02:52] <VictorVE> ongandrew, go with Ubuntu, the regular one
[02:52] <VictorVE> then specialize
[02:52] <Cyber_Akuma> keelG: Again, I installed the bootloader to the usb flashdrive
[02:52] <Blacklite_> I need help
[02:52] <keelG> escott: please stop, I cant bare to laugh so hard at this hour! ^_^
[02:52] <damselfly9> ongandrew; if you got the money to spend, RedHat or Suse
[02:52] <Blacklite_> HALP
[02:52] <Blacklite_> PLZZZZZ
[02:52] <VictorVE> Zero knowledge of linux = default one :P
[02:52] <ongandrew> regular one? which version
[02:53] <keelG> Cyber_Akuma: sorry mate, I just answered your last senteance :)
[02:53] <VictorVE> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop
[02:53] <escott> ongandrew, regular ubuntu desktop would be the standard recommendation unless you have a specific desire/hardware limitation
[02:53] <Cyber_Akuma> I decided to try out ubuntu by installing it to a usb flashdrive... it couldne't focus on the right window to save it's life, got corruted after a reboot, and now screwed up my windows bootloader...
[02:53] <Cyber_Akuma> I think Linux hates me..
[02:53] <VictorVE> For long-term support,
[02:53] <VictorVE> choose Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
[02:54] <escott> ongandrew, 12.10 if you want to upgrade in 3 months, 12.04 if you dont
[02:54] <Blacklite_> FFS GUISE!!!
[02:54] <VictorVE> Cyber, Linux doesn't hate :)
[02:54] <keelG> Yea Guise stop harrasing Blacklite_!
[02:54] <Blacklite_> how do I remove the bouncing icon in KUBUNTU PRECISE
[02:54] <ongandrew> whats the diff of 12.04 and 12.1
[02:55] <Cyber_Akuma> VictorVE: First time I ever tried a livecd it kernel paniced on boot... a livecd! Granted, that was Knoppix years ago...

[02:55] <Cyber_Akuma> but yeah, I have NEVER had much success with linux. I thought to try again with ubuntu... it just wrecked everything >.<
[02:55] <escott> !eol | ongandrew
[02:55] <ubottu> ongandrew: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[02:55] <VictorVE> ongandrew: 12.04 = no reinstall in years
[02:55] <VictorVE> 12.10 = reinstall in months
[02:55] <keelG> Blacklite_: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+do+I+remove+the+bouncing+icon+in+KUBUNTU+PRECISE
[02:55] <VictorVE> your pick!
[02:56] <jarray52> keelG: Thanks again. That worked like a charm. I now have virtual box running on Ubuntu 12.04 with the 12.10 kernel.
[02:56] <ongandrew> ok ok i think am gonna go with 12.04 thanks everyone
[02:56] <escott> ongandrew, you dont have to reinstall, but you would have to upgrade which replaces all the software on the system with newer versions
[02:56] <keelG> jarray52: no probs mate! good to hear you're up and running
[02:56] <usr13> ongandrew: You mean 12.04 and 12.10  Well, the first obvious difference is that they are 6 months apart. Second, and most important, 12.04 is LTS and 12.10 is not.
[02:56] <AGreyCrane> keelG: FYI worked around it for the moment by enableing write-through caching on the disk in KVM. Something about qemu not likeing 4k sector disks in cache none mode
[02:56] <VictorVE> yes 12.04 = GOOD CHOICE!
[02:56] <damselfly9> Cyber_Akuma; strange, the pendrive shouldn't have overwritten window's boot loader
[02:56] <Blacklite_> keelsG: like I haven't tried that already.
[02:56] <Cyber_Akuma> I know
[02:56] <livefree424_> I'm following the Ubuntu app tutorial for the currency converter and i followed all the steps but instead of a currency converter all my code displays is a HELLO WORLD any ideas...here is my code http://pastebin.com/46U8hsAq
[02:56] <ongandrew> another thing about the difference on bought the version i mean is there interface diff or something like that
[02:57] <Cyber_Akuma> thats why I am so surprised this happened
[02:57] <VictorVE> You are a newcomer so probably would appreciate the larger life-span
[02:57] <Cyber_Akuma> I just wanted a removable install of linux I could plug into the pc when I needed
[02:57] <keelG> AGreyCrane: sounds like some advanced konfu! You must teach me some time ;)
[02:57] <Cyber_Akuma> Not only could I not get it to work, but it for some reason overwrote the windows bootloader
[02:57] <escott> AGreyCrane, thats a bit scary
[02:57] <damselfly9> Cyber_Akuma; what did it over-write it with?
[02:58] <keelG> Cyber_Akuma: do you have Linux installed as well on the machine with Windows?
[02:58] <Cyber_Akuma> keelG: windows is on an internal hdd, ubuntu was installed on an external usb flashdrive
[02:58] <Cyber_Akuma> And I set the bootloader to isntall to the falshdrive when I installed ubuntu
[02:58] <livefree424_> Cyber_Akuma: you can go to ubuntu.com and use the windows installer and its like running a program but gives you ubuntu os
[02:58] <keelG> Cyber_Akuma: how did you install?
[02:59] <escott> Cyber_Akuma, thats not always supported
[02:59] <Cyber_Akuma> livefree424_: I prefer to run it native
[02:59] <AGreyCrane> escott: yeah, working of an old bug report from 2010, but the suggested work around still worked o.O https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=608548
[02:59] <ubottu> bugzilla.redhat.com bug 608548 in qemu-kvm "QEMU doesn't respect hardware sector size of underlying block device when doing O_DIRECT" [High,Closed: errata]
[02:59] <WarNinJa> hello everyone, can someone please tell me how to connect to an undernet server please? i do not know the address to get there
[02:59] <mgdunn> has anyone had issue during installation, whether you turn nomodeset or apci=off on or not.  Computer is a Dell XPS15z if that helps. I've seen it has had a bunch of issues
[02:59] <Cyber_Akuma> keelG: booted the livecd, chose to manually configure the install path, formatted my usb drive as ext4 and set it's mount point as "/", then set the bootloader to install to the flashdrive
[02:59] <gormanator> ey everyone...kind of a newbie to ubuntu...exploring multitouch options. By default i can do two finger scrolling, but I was looking for a little more customiziablity. It doesn't seem like my current touchpad is supported by touchegg, a solution I tried earlier
[03:00] <mgdunn> always get blank screen
[03:00] <Cyber_Akuma> ... barely that is, the mouse wasn't behaving
[03:00] <damselfly9> WarNinJa; us.undernet.org or eu.undernet.org (?)
[03:00] <Cyber_Akuma> still didn't even after it was installed
[03:00] <WarNinJa> damselfly9 thank you i will try, ill let you know if it fails thanks again
[03:02] <livefree424_> I'm following the Ubuntu app tutorial for the currency converter and i followed all the steps but instead of a currency converter all my code displays is a HELLO WORLD any ideas...here is my code http://pastebin.com/46U8hsAq
[03:02] <JonEdney> Is thjere a way to run the gnome shell on 12.10, but still be able to go back to unity if need be?  I am not familiar with the gnome interface and want to check it out
[03:02] <Cyber_Akuma> The mouse was never focusing on the right window, and attempting to install videocard drivers just made the whole isntall corrupt
[03:02] <escott> !gnome | JonathanD
[03:02] <ubottu> JonathanD: GNOME is the default !desktop environment on Ubuntu up to 10.10 To install it from Kubuntu or Xubuntu, type « sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop » in a !terminal.

[03:02] <escott> !gnome-shell | JonEdney
[03:03] <waver> thmmm ok it froze again
[03:03] <escott> JonEdney, apt-get install gnome-shell
[03:03] <waver> trying the PCI sata card
[03:03] <JonEdney> ty escott
[03:03] <waver> thinking this has to be related to the new 3TB drive
[03:03] <escott> JonEdney, the debian gnome-shell seems to work a lot better though
[03:04] <wector> Not think more do it
[03:04] <keelG> waver: my immediate attention is directed at the drive also, but needs more testing  before I could say anything with certanty ;(
[03:05] <waver> for sure appreciate you guys thinking through it with me
[03:05] <escott> waver, were you in AHCI mode before?
[03:05] <waver> just nice to bounce some ideas off of others :)
[03:05] <keelG> always glad to help :)
[03:05] <waver> I also checked to ensure all of the memory is seated properly
[03:05] <waver> hmm escott
[03:05] <waver> has been awhile since I've had a monitor hooked up to look at the bios on this box
[03:05] <escott> waver, (and are you in AHCI now)
[03:06] <waver> the sata could be set to I believe "IDE" mode
[03:06] <waver> not 100% sure on that though
[03:06] <waver> just seems like I remember something wonky like that
[03:06] <waver> I can hook up a monitor and look
[03:06] <escott> waver, that could be an issue with a 3tb disk (its going to have some crazy firmware to deal with fixing up logical vs physical sectors
[03:07] <waver> mmmm yea
[03:07] <keelG> Vendor-firmware-voodoo
[03:08] <ClientAlive> I need to use the linux command line on my brand new lappy (with winblows 8 on it). I'm having a difficult time getting it to boot the 64 bit desktop cd for 12.04. So far I have: disabled secure boot in bios, enabled legacy boot in bios, move the cd/dvd rom drive to the top of the list in both the legacy and uefi lists. Reboot ant it STILL boots into win 8.
[03:08] <ClientAlive> what do I do?
[03:08] <genio_> how i can play Minecraft on ubuntu guys ??????????????
[03:09] <escott> ClientAlive, if you change to legacy bios windows will be non-bootable
[03:09] <ClientAlive> It's booted now
=== vjn_ is now known as vjn
[03:09] <ClientAlive> I made that change
[03:09] <ClientAlive> let me reboot and go into bios setting to verify
[03:09] <escott> ClientAlive, its clearly not taking. if it were then windows wouldn't boot
[03:09] <ClientAlive> ok
[03:09] <ClientAlive> I'll check
[03:10] <keelG> ClientAlive: It will mostlikely detect you have a EFI partition and boot UEFI - if you didnt have that present, it would fallback and boot legacy
[03:10] <damselfly9> does windows 8 absolutely require uefi?
[03:10] <escott> ClientAlive, the firmware is probably trying to be smart and ignoring your requests because it would make the system unbootable
[03:10] <mgdunn> Does anyone have any advice for my attempt at installing.  I have to turn nomodeset on or else the computer just turns off, if I turn that on and apci=off on I still eventually just get a blank screen.  My computer is a Dell XPS15z if that helps since I know it has had some issues.  Basically any attempt at install end in a blank screen
[03:10] <keelG> damselfly9: iirc yes
[03:11] <keelG> To be "Windows Certified" I know it _HAS_ to, but I don't if they allow some backwards compatability
[03:11] <mgdunn> tried from DVD and USB for both 12.04 and 12.10
[03:11] <keelG> mgdunn: dual gfx?
[03:12] <mgdunn> no
[03:12] <wector> I did it via 12.10 atall
[03:12] <somsip>      zxcbnnm
[03:13] <somsip> oops - vacuuming keyboard...
[03:13] <ClientAlive> ok. I'm looking at my bios settings, insyde bios (gag me), system configuration tab, boot order submenu, and the option entitled "Legacy Support" is <Enabled>, the option entitled "Secure Boot" is <Dissabled>
[03:13] <ClientAlive> at any rate what can I do to boot that live cd in this system?
=== dt3kk is now known as sect0r
[03:14] <escott> ClientAlive, you shouldnt have any trouble booting the install cd even in efi mode. i would verify you burned it correctly
[03:14] <ClientAlive> that is a possible problem
[03:14] <wector> Windows most die
[03:14] <keelG> I experienced trouble booting Ubuntu LiveUSBs in UEFI mode however :)
[03:14] <somsip> oops - vacuuming keyboard...
[03:15] <ClientAlive> it is the "amd 64" release and I'm running intel. I didn't think that should matter tho. Does it?
[03:15] <keelG> Nop
[03:15] <damselfly9> ClientAlive; what model intel cpu?
[03:15] <ClientAlive> sudo kvm-ok
[03:15] <ClientAlive> hang on
[03:15] <ClientAlive> sorry bout that
[03:16] <ClientAlive> http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/load_configuration.do?destination=review&email_id=2436514&jumpid=in_r329_emailconfig  <- That's the beast
[03:16] <ClientAlive> that what they shipped me
[03:16] <mgdunn> graphics is nvidia gt525M if that helps
[03:18] <escott> mgdunn, if that is nvidia optimus then that will be a problem
[03:19] <damselfly9> ClientAlive; doesn't really say what model cpu chip it's running
[03:19] <ongandrew> are there anyone that i could change my booting screen like i want to see a circle like the one on the website (which i can't seem to find now) he said how fast does your computer load
[03:19] <ClientAlive> Perhaps I should throw out there what I'm really, ultimately after. Here's the situation. I paid another $175 for that cpu because it has intel vt-d. I've made numerous attempts to find out if the chipset and bios are going to support that through HP but alas, to no avail at all. I need a certain way to know (or understand) whether I'm able to make use of this vt-d technology or this things going back to HP.
[03:19] <ClientAlive> intel i7 - 3820QM
[03:20] <cub> how to view images in terminal
[03:20] <keelG> like as ascii art?
[03:20] <escott> cub, eog
[03:20] <cub> idk like when im using links
[03:20] <cub> to browse
[03:21] <keelG> ClientAlive: what is it you wish to achieve by using Intel VT-d?
[03:21] <ClientAlive> what I was hoping may help is to run sudo kvm-ok (after installing it) via the live cd.
=== Wug is now known as Wug[Hyperspace]
[03:21] <escott> ClientAlive, just because the cpu has vt-d doesnt mean anything
[03:21] <escott> ClientAlive, the motherboard must have an iommu as well. you probably just wasted $175
[03:21] <ClientAlive> that's the same thing someone else asked me. Atm, I'm not an expert on the technology. I do however want to experiment with it and learn.
[03:22] <cub> im just trying to use links on a ubuntu server install to view pics
[03:22] <ClientAlive> so my current objective is to determine that I have it available (the cpu supports it but what about the other factors?)
[03:22] <cub> thats why i was asking .. ty for helping
[03:23] <compdoc> ClientAlive, why do you need vt-d?
[03:23] <ClientAlive> escott: that is exactly the problem. Try finding out anything about a lappy mobo or it's chipset or the bios from HP - not gonna happen  ;<
[03:23] <ClientAlive> Pissed as hell about that
[03:23] <damselfly9> ClientAlive; how much ram do you have?
[03:23] <ClientAlive> compdoc: do I have to know why I need it to want it?
[03:23] <ClientAlive> 8 gb
[03:23] <escott> ClientAlive, if you need vt-d you should be building your own machine from components you can select and verify before you purchase
[03:24] <compdoc> never found it necessary in all the years ive been building vm servers to run kvm
[03:24] <keelG> ClientAlive: This will tell you what the CPU supports, but as escott mentioned, some of the tech requires other tech or might even be limited by the OEM: http://ark.intel.com/products/64889/Intel-Core-i7-3820QM-Processor-8M-Cache-up-to-3_70-GHz
[03:25] <ClientAlive> escott: ideally, yes. I love this lappy in every other respect but I probably wouldn't have paid for a cpu upgrade if not for vt-d. I may want to return it for a refund if the chipset and bois aren't going to allow it.
[03:25] <keelG> I recall Sony not letting their customers enable Intel VT at all, even though the CPU supported it - fail!
[03:25] <ClientAlive> keelG: what you said is exactly the part I'm after. It is why I'm here. Is the information I seek to discover.
[03:25] <ClientAlive> the chipset and the bios
[03:26] <escott> ClientAlive, there is no good way to find out except to install kvm and see if you can passthrough whatever device it is you want to pass through
[03:26] <ClientAlive> ok
[03:26] <escott> ClientAlive, and dig through every single tab in the bios
[03:27] <JPeterson> how do i add ~/.bash_profile to ubuntu1 from the shell?
[03:27] <damselfly9> ClientAlive; I had the interesting experience lately of trying one distro's burnt cd where the cd tested good but more than half the machines I tried it in rejected it as non-bootable
[03:27] <craigbass1976> What's the best way to install unity on xubuntu?
[03:27] <ongandrew> question everyone how do i obtain this kind of loading screen (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFRP1D4KkH0)
[03:27] <escott> JPeterson, vi ~/.bash_profile
[03:27] <zman099> should i buy a new laptop or buy a ssd for my old latitude d630
[03:27] <zman099> and install ubuntu
[03:27] <craigbass1976> unity interface only has three stars in software center, so I wasn't sure if that was the one.
[03:27] <bsmith093> i have the wierdest problem, sudo apt-get update refuses to connect to any server i try, but every other web based thing i have works fine. fresh 12.04 install
[03:28] <JPeterson> escott: with add i mean synchronize
[03:28] <ClientAlive> escott: ok. This makes sense. So far, what I've seen in bios says "Virtualization Technology" with options to "enable" or "dissable" (it's currently enabled because of me). This seems very general name to me and I don't understand if "Virtualization Technology" in cluded vt-d or not.
[03:28] <craigbass1976> bsmith093, where are you?  I was in a school the other day and I think they were blocking ubuntu updates for some reason
[03:28] <ClientAlive> damselfly9: interesting
[03:28] <bsmith093> craigbass1976: home network worked fine 20 minutes ago
[03:29] <damselfly9> ClientAlive; so apparently there has been something weird going on with cd bootcode lately that makes it only bottable in some machines
[03:29] <escott> ClientAlive, what you expect the firmware to be well documented? crazy man, next you will expect it to be written correctly. it never ends with people like you
[03:29] <ClientAlive> it would be nice
[03:30] <ClientAlive> no, I just wonder how virutualization tech works in general. If it is normal for the virutalization extensions to include vt-d or have it separate
[03:30] <ClientAlive> that's what would be very telling
[03:30] <rstat1> usually separate
[03:30] <ongandrew> how do i obtain this kind of loadking screen http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFRP1D4KkH0
[03:30] <escott> ClientAlive, could be either way. it could mean vmx it could mean vt-d it could mean that your board doesnt support vt-d it could be both
[03:31] <ClientAlive> I see
[03:31] <phunyguy> Is it possible to load Ubuntu on a Microsoft Surface tablet? I got one for free from work, and I was just curious.
[03:31] <keelG> phunyguy you can tell us, is the bootloader unlocked?
[03:31] <ClientAlive> I'll try the empiracle method then as you suggest (make a vm and try to pass a device through).
[03:31] <xrs> phunyguy,  yes you can but you may need to use boot-repair for the linux bootloader to work
[03:31] <ClientAlive> thx

[04:09] <tim_> oh okay. that makes it very easy.
[04:09] <tim_> i now just need to boot from my flash drive
[04:09] <tim_> and im all set

[04:18] <kewel> aha
[04:18] <kewel> thx
[04:19] <grndlvl> I have a lenovo t430s running ubuntu 12.04LTS using the 3.4.0-030400-generic kernel (because of lock ups have been on it since like the second day and suspend previously worked) and recently suspend stopped working any ideas or a good direction to start diagnosing the issue? thx in adv.
[04:20] <grndlvl> btw it does attempt to suspend, however, it immediately wakes up
[04:20] <AnonGr_> !x #part
[04:22] <Lucenut> OK, I was able to connect in the file explorer. But in Eclipse I still only see the linux file system. Do I need to map a drive or something?
[04:22] <dr_willis> grndlvl:  try older kernels. see if it goes back to working. if so definatly file a bug report.
[04:22] <dr_willis> Lucenut:  for non gnome apps.. look in your ~/.gvfs directory
[04:22] <grndlvl> yeah I tried the latest 3.2 release as well :(
[04:22] <dr_willis> Lucenut:  or you can mount shares by hand to specific local directories to be easier to find.
[04:24] <grndlvl> dr_willis: ok thx; I will try to debug further and if I can't figure it out I will post a bug report. I wish I knew when it stopped exactly. The weird thing is I have been using the same kernel b/c 12.04LTS is still supplying 3.2 out of the repos.
[04:26] <dr_willis> i never use hibernate or suspend. ;)
[04:27] <Lucenut> Sorry Dr Willis. I don't understand either of those suggestions.
[04:27] <grndlvl> dr_willis: yeah I hear ya. I rarely do myself, except when I do b/c of travel and what not
[04:28] <grndlvl> thx though
[04:28] <Lucenut> I tried creating a "virtual file system" in Eclipse with the same IP/info as I connected with the file explorer but no luck.
[04:29] <dr_willis> Lucenut:  look in your users .gvfs directory. the shares get mounted inside there
[04:29] <dr_willis>  the full path would be /home/yourusername/.gvfs
[04:29] <grndlvl> ha found something that might be down the right alley
[04:29] <Lucenut> I couldn't find anything like .gvfs

[04:30] <dr_willis> Lucenut:  look again.. ;)  you do realize things that begin with a . are hidden by default in the file manager.. type in the full path
[04:30] <Lucenut> Type it in where?
[04:31] <Lucenut> Ecplise doesn't have an address box.

[04:33] <dr_willis> use the normal file manager perhaps?
[04:34] <dr_willis> I dontuse eclipse.. so no idea how it works
[04:34] <Lucenut> OK, there is an address box. I typed in smb://192.168.1.105/wwwroot and it's just grinding.
[04:34] <dr_willis> smb:// is a special kind of address used by Gnome/gtk/ type apps.. TRY the .gvfs directory
[04:35] <dr_willis> not all apps support smb:// type nameing
[04:35] <HowardTheDuck> hi is ubuntu a good operation system
[04:35] <dr_willis> HowardTheDuck:  works very well for most people/
[04:35] <Lucenut> Just type ".gvfs" in the address bar?
[04:35] <xrs> HowardTheDuck,  Ubuntu Studio is better
[04:35] <waver> so far so good using the PCI Sata
[04:35] <HowardTheDuck> s-s-studio
[04:35] <waver> shall see if it freezes
[04:35] <dr_willis> Lucenut:  again.. i DONT use eclipse..  however you enter a path to save/load files.. you look in your .gvfs directory
[04:35] <josesierra> Wondering if somebody might know something about this or maybe point me in the right direction: I'm running Gnome Shell 3.6 and it just gobbles up memory like crazy
[04:36] <HowardTheDuck> i have 10.04 but im afraid to upgarde
[04:36] <josesierra> Unity does as well, even more than Gnome Shell...
[04:36] <HowardTheDuck> because of this g-nome
[04:36] <dr_willis> !10.04
[04:36] <ubottu> Ubuntu 10.04 LTS (Lucid Lynx) was the twelfth release of Ubuntu. Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1004 - Supported until April 2013 (Desktop), April 2015 (Server)
[04:36] <cfhowlett> HowardTheDuck, gnome will not prevent upgrades ... what do you mean
[04:36] <xrs> open the task manager and see whats taking up all the memory
[04:36] <dr_willis> gnome-2 is basically dead.. time to bury it and move on. ;)
[04:37] <HowardTheDuck> wow dead is a strong word
[04:37] <cfhowlett> HowardTheDuck, xubuntu and lubuntu are lightweight alternatives
[04:37] <HowardTheDuck> i like gnome do
[04:37] <dr_willis> I wouldent say its strong enough.. its been sick for a long time.
[04:37] <dr_willis> Theres numerous docks in 12.10  you can play with
[04:37] <Lucenut> "file:///.gvfs"
[04:37] <dr_willis> Ive heard plank is nice.. but not sure if its in the default repos. (it may be to new)
[04:37] <zykotick9> dr_willis: gnome2 is dead.  and gnome3 fallback is even living-dead at this point ;)
[04:37] <cfhowlett> HowardTheDuck, don't upgrade yet.  install xubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-desktop and try them out.
[04:38] <OerHeks> and Kubuntu
[04:38] <HowardTheDuck> i have the verion of lubuntu that was around when 10.04 ubuntu came out installed on my centrino laptop
[04:38] <dr_willis> Yep. Not heard lately if gnome-fallback is on or off the chopping block at this time.. ;) i wouldent count on it being around for much longer
[04:38] <dr_willis> 12.10 lubuntu is very nice
[04:39] <crippledmonk> Anyone ever use crunchbang? Don't hit me. just asking.
[04:39] <HowardTheDuck> nestles crunch
[04:39]  * cfhowlett smacks crippledmonk ...
[04:39] <dr_willis> I just install openbox :) if i need openbox
[04:39] <dr_willis> or blackbox. or fluxbox. or whatever ;)
[04:40] <Lucenut> Dr. Willis I tried "file:///.gvfs", "file://.gvfs"

[04:41] <singharkirat> I m new to ubuntu, can i know how to update this thing... :-/
[04:41] <dr_willis> Lucenut:  how about just /home/yourusername/.gvfs ?
[04:41] <timaaa> Im in the middle of setting up xbuntu and im wondering how to do a partion
[04:41] <cfhowlett> singharkirat, what version
[04:41] <dr_willis> !manual
[04:41] <ubottu> The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[04:41] <dr_willis> timaaa:  how to do what partition? what sort of layout your partions should be in? depends on your needs.
[04:42] <singharkirat> 12.04
[04:42] <cfhowlett> singharkirat, you want to upgrade to a new version of ubuntu or just update 12.04?
[04:42] <timaaa> How to do a partion to install xbuntu
[04:43] <singharkirat> Just update
[04:43] <dr_willis> timaaa:  the installer can auto partition. Or you an do it by hand.
[04:43] <cfhowlett> singharkirat, just run update manager  system>update manager
[04:43] <Toph2> dr_willis,,, i'm just followin the thread.. In my directory, .gvfs is a directory not a file
[04:44] <dr_willis> Toph2:  thats correct.. it is a directory that contains all the samba mounts and other special mounts
[04:44] <Toph2> dr_willis,,, ok

[04:45] <Lucenut> Dr. Willis I can browse to /home/greg/ then I add ".gvfs" and it just sits there saying wait.
[04:46] <dr_willis> Lucenut:  try going there from your normal file manager.
[04:46] <singharkirat> I m not getting any shrinking option...
[04:47] <cfhowlett> singharkirat, you said you wanted to update ubuntu.  are you installing something now?
[04:47] <dr_willis> singharkirat: if your system is allready using 4 primary partitions   then you may have to do some work to repartion things
[04:47] <singharkirat> I installed
[04:48] <Lucenut> Nope, can't find .gvfs in the file explorer.
[04:48] <cfhowlett> singharkirat, so why are you now shrinking partitions?  To accomplish what?
[04:48] <zykotick9> dr_willis: huge advantage of gtp, no primary partition limit :)

[04:50] <megha> is their a software for fxp transfter ?
[04:50] <cfhowlett> megha, fxp?  you mean ftp?
[04:50] <Nickelx> hello all, this might be a strange question to come to the irc about, but does anyone know of a gameboy advance emulator that's compatible with 12.10?? I'm having issues with visualboy advance and have been looking for fixes and whatnot to no avail.
[04:50] <megha> cfhowlett: no i meant fxp
[04:50] <dr_willis> fxp - Hmm.. i recall seeing that asked befor.. thats some sort of modified ftp.. i think we  looked into it and a great many of the ftp clients did it.... but ive never used fxp
[04:50] <dr_willis> couldent really see the point of fxp ;)
[04:51] <singharkirat> I hv 3 primary partitions..  I want to shrink one and make them 4
[04:51] <cfhowlett> singharkirat, boot your ubuntu cd/usb.  fire up gparted.  shrink (CAREFULLY).  Remove the boot CD/USB and restart ubuntu
[04:52] <BlackDalek> how do I send quick chat messages over a LAN? Is there any program for this in Ubuntu?
[04:52] <zykotick9> Nickelx: i've used mednafen for gba in the past
[04:52] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  depends on how the other guys are logged in if they will see them or not and what apps you should be using
[04:52] <singharkirat> Thanks
[04:52] <megha> dr_willis: it useless but i have no other way than to use fxp
[04:52] <Nickelx> zykotick9: thanks hombre, i'll google that right now! <3
[04:52] <dr_willis> megha:  try the various ftp clients and see i guess.
[04:53] <megha> dr_willis: can you name some of the clients ?
[04:53] <bsmith093> any ideas, update manager works fine, but apt cant find any server i try and connect it to, and every other web thing works perfectly
[04:53] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, this is over a the same LAN (everyone will be using the same client) - NOT over internet...
[04:53] <dr_willis> megha:  apt-cache search ftp        nautilus has ftp built in also
[04:53] <BlackDalek> Does such an app exist for Ubuntu?
[04:53] <megha> dr_willis: ok :)
[04:53] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  using whata same 'client' ?  are they sshed in? in X in what?
[04:54] <singharkirat> I have installed ubuntu 12.10 on my lenovo thinkstation s20, on some of them every thing is fine but on some the system hangs after grub... Amy help
[04:54] <dr_willis> I thought the ubuntu IM stuff had some sort of "local network" chat feature
[04:55] <singharkirat> I noticed that the graphics appear very poor on the system with this problem...
[04:55] <Nickelx> zykotick9: i just installed that via apt, and i can't find it, why would that be?
[04:55] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, I think it used to.. but now everything seems to be geared towards needing to go through the interent :(... I am trying to find something that will allow IM over a LAN without needing internet connection to function...
[04:56] <BlackDalek> internet*
[04:57] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, LAN IM client would need to run on either Ubuntu 12.04 or 12.10, as that is what all PCs are using.
[04:57] <cfhowlett> singharkirat, check for restricted/proprietary drivers.  Also, if you are installing for work deployment machines, I'd suggest you install 12.04, the Long Term Support release
[04:58] <bsmith093> apparentyl anon proxy will screw up apt, dunno why but one quick purge and i can apt-get again
[04:58] <waver> hmmmm
[04:58] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  you could set up some sort of jabber or irc server for the lan to use. that may be the easiest thing.
[04:59] <waver> keelG you still around?
[04:59] <zykotick9> Nickelx: it's a cli starting app, with a quasi-GUI once started.  from terminal try "mednafen /path/to/rom"

[05:11] <arun_> hey is there any theme for ubuntu 12.1

[05:18] <tonsofpcs> alejandro_: depends on the BIOS.  My work netbook can't function with linux using the wifi because the switch is handled by software
[05:18] <PhysicsBrain> tonsofpcs: Only this and my system will require the system password?

[05:52] <Frank604> No problemo Mr. Bernard
[05:55] <kewel> what's the apt-get command to show installed packages matching 'java' ?
[05:55] <dr_willis> apt-cache search pattern
[05:55] <dr_willis> !apt
[05:55] <ubottu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome), !Muon (KDE) or !Apper (KDE)
[05:55] <kewel> swee ot
[05:56] <kewel> ack too much .. how do I remove java 7?
[05:56] <dr_willis> depends on how you isntalled it.
[05:56] <dr_willis> apt-get remove packagename
[05:56] <dr_willis> !java
[05:56] <ubottu> To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[05:57] <dr_willis> or install some other java and just tell the system to use the other java
[05:57] <LiteBeer> kewel: dpkg -l '*java*' | grep ^ii
[05:57] <kewel> I used sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
[05:57] <dr_willis> cant say ive ever needed to uninstall java. ;) so never really tried it.
[05:57] <kewel> I'm trying to downgrade to java 6 ..
[05:58] <kewel> my roommate is trying to play games on pogo .. and this piii 1ghz 512 is having trouble with java (i think)
[05:59] <kewel> I did 'sudo apt-get install oracle-java6-installer' .. but I tested my java version on the web and it's still 7
[05:59] <dr_willis> there is a way you can have both installed and switch btween them.
[06:00] <kewel> ooh
[06:00] <kewel> do tell!
[06:00] <dr_willis> see the !java factoid url
[06:00] <dr_willis> i belive its in there
[06:00] <LiteBeer> kewel: try: update-alternatives --config java
[06:02] <kewel> got it
[06:02] <kewel> do I need to restart chrome?
[06:02] <xrs> i would
[06:07] <PrincessLuna> Anyone with an ultrabook? How are you using the msata drive?
[06:08] <kewel> hmm
[06:08] <mhs> Can any body tell me the Indian chatting rooms
[06:09] <kewel> changed to default to 6 .. rebooted .. listed version options with 'sudo update-alternatives --config java' -- told me 6 .. like I told it to .. however when I go to a java test page in chrome it says I'm running 7
[06:09] <kewel> it makes sense if that doesn't make sense
[06:09] <timmm> Hello im about to set up xbuntu and im wondering how to comfigue the hard drive
[06:10] <sakui> why does my screen go blank in ubuntu server 12.04.1 x86 after grub bootloader?
[06:11] <xrs> timmm,  i would make a swap partition that is = in size to the amount of ram you have, the rest depends on how big the hard drive is but you want the largest partition to be /home  (you will need a "/" partition. this is where xubuntu and its apps will install to.)
[06:12] <xrs> !in
[06:12] <ubottu> #ubuntu-in is the channel for Ubuntu in India
[06:13] <timmm> So currently i have a hard drive configured for windows 7. So do i need to resize the partions? Xrs
[06:15] <xrs> if you want it on the win7 hard drive and you have no "unallocated" space, yes you will need to resize the partition. in that case you are better off with a small SWAP and all else partitioned as "/" (not haveing a /home partition will make things harder in the long run but for your setup thats the easiest way)
[06:15] <xrs> BACK UP YOUR DATA
[06:15] <timmm> I got a bacckup
[06:15] <timmm> Im confused by what to do
[06:16] <xrs> well then resize the windows partition to give you however much linux space you want and let Xubuntu take care of the rest
[06:17] <timmm> Im not sure how to resize a partion. Call me a noob its okay, xrs
[06:17] <dr_willis> the installer can resize existing windows partions. or you can use gparted from a live cd for total control.
[06:17] <xrs> there is a program called gparted (i think xubuntu put it in the Settings Manager in the launcher menu)
[06:18] <xrs> gparted is like windows disk management
[06:18] <dr_willis> typical layout for a windows/xubuntu sustem  -->    (primary windows ntfs - a few 100gb+)  (extended partion with logicals for  Luubntu /  and swap)
[06:18] <Ray> its usually by clicking mouse right button > resize/shrink
[06:18] <dr_willis> or you could use all primaries if you wanted to. but theres a limit to 4 of those with non-gpt systems
[06:19] <Ray> ensure that if u use gparted, ntfs supported. (ntfsprogs)
[06:19] <xrs> use gparted to resize the windows partition and let the xubuntu installer handle the rest of the partitioning. be sure you tell it you want to dual boot with windows
[06:20] <xrs> xubuntu's gparted comes with ntfs-utils
[06:20] <Ray> great
[06:20] <dr_willis> My normal disk layout -->     (windows) (linux / 30gb) (/home big as i can get it) (1gb swap)
[06:21] <timmm> so do i need a usb to us gparted?
[06:21] <Ray> recomendded swap is 2x of your ram, but its not a "rule" on making swap
[06:21] <xrs> no
[06:21] <Spanky100> dr_willis:  You using any utility in Windows to access your home directory?
[06:21] <dr_willis> a gparted-live cd/usb s a very handy tool
[06:21] <timmm> Dont have disc drive
[06:22] <dr_willis> Spanky100:  any of the windows tools to access ext* ive found very flakey.
[06:22] <xrs> timm go to the launcher menu (the mouse thingy in the upper-left) select Settings Manager -> gparted
[06:22] <Spanky100> Me too.  that's why I asked...
[06:22] <Ray> no usb need
[06:22] <timmm> I dont see it xrs..
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[06:23] <Ray> akh, u use xubuntu?
[06:23] <Spanky100> dr_willis:  You formatting home with NTFS then? I presume you mean to imply that /home is on a separate partition...
[06:23] <xrs> okay let me switch over to my xubuntu PC
[06:23] <Ray> definitely
[06:23] <timmm> Im running off my usb key with xbuntu
[06:23] <dr_willis> Spanky100  You dont use NTFS for home
[06:24] <dr_willis> I use 4 primary partions
[06:24] <dr_willis> My current setup has /home on its own 3TB hard drive.
[06:24] <Ray> wow
[06:24] <Spanky100> No I don't....  Was wondering if you do though with your 3rd partition so you can see it in your windows directory...
[06:25] <Spanky100> Or is third partition /home just ext3 or ext4
[06:25] <timmm> Okay i have a windows netbook running xubuntu from my usb key and am trying to install it.
[06:26] <Ray> owh
[06:26] <Spanky100> I've kind of given up on multi-boot systems.  I've pretty much dedicated on box Linux or Windows and kind of just stick with it...
[06:26] <apos> timmm do you see a round blue icon with a mouse in the upper left corner of the screen?
[06:26] <timmm> Yup
[06:26] <apos> click that then click settings manager
[06:26] <apos> gparted is in there
[06:26] <Ray> thats it~
[06:27] <Ray> step-by-step makes it easier
[06:27] <timmm> I dont see it
[06:27] <dr_willis> I rarely boot into windows these days. its on its own hd on most of my systems
[06:28] <Spanky100> New VMware Workstation 9.X working pretty well on Ubuntu 12.04 over here.... Have to give credit to the VMWare guys.  The interface is clean.
[06:28] <Ray> on xubuntu, is Gparted included on the live CD/USB?
[06:28] <apos> yes
[06:28] <apos> it disapears after install but its there for the install
[06:28] <dr_willis> Ray:  if its not.. you can install it  and it will install to ram. so you can use it
[06:28] <dr_willis> ;)
[06:28] <Ray> yeah
[06:29] <Spanky100> I'm about 75/25.  Work applications necessitate some Windows...  Been trying to stick with Ubuntu or variants for all my server tasks.
[06:29] <dr_willis> theres specific gparted live cds you can get also
[06:29] <timmm> Found it
[06:29] <Ray> nah
[06:29] <timmm> Under system
[06:29] <Spanky100> 75% Windows unfortunately.  Lot of time on the workstation....
[06:30] <Ray> hmm, keep you're eyes open, you just opened it when find the gparted~
[06:30] <apos> i havent touched a windows pc since i found ubuntu studio
[06:30] <timmm> Ya i found gparted
[06:30] <Ray> open it -_-
[06:30] <timmm> It is open
[06:31] <dr_willis> now may be a good time to watch a gparted tutorial or 2 on youtube. ;)
[06:31] <apos> right click on your windows partition and choose resize
[06:31] <Ray> try to locate the win partition
[06:31] <dr_willis> and.. you DO have backups allready made?
[06:31] <timmm> Yup
[06:31] <dr_willis> you do know how to restore from thebackups? ;)   seen that happen once...
[06:31] <Ray> haha
[06:32] <timmm> Okay so ive got 284 gigs total of my main partion
[06:32] <Ray> he know it, he plays with partition!
[06:32] <apos> now you need to decide how much space you want for linux
[06:32] <Spanky100> timm:  Of all the utilities I've used on Windows Images - I would recommend Macrium Reflect.  Unless you are are sure your image is bulletproof.
[06:32] <apos> i would say no less than 16GB
[06:33] <Ray> yeah
[06:33] <timmm> I think ill go about 84
[06:33] <Ray> right click on the desired partition > resize/move
[06:34] <Ray> you're on making a place for the new neighborhood~

[07:45] <Ray> its an App
[07:45] <cub> apos?
[07:45] <cub> yes Ray i've used it
[07:45] <cub> and my graphics chip isnt supported so it really didnt help much
[07:45] <Ray> bloody right you do
[07:45] <eoin_> how many people are happy with unity as it is now?
[07:45] <apos> cub,  http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/06/11-tips-to-speed-up-computers-running.html
[07:46] <Ray> many people, definitely
[07:46] <apos> i ditched unity almost immediately. i keep trying it out as a touch screen OS but im just not happy with the menu
[07:46] <Ray> yeah, now im downloading gnome3
[07:47] <apos> xfce = boss
[07:47] <eoin_> same as me apos ubuntu is great linux distro it's just that UI
[07:47] <Ray> sometime bored with this unirt
[07:47] <cub> yeah the menu is crap
[07:47] <cub> my hardware is what is really giving me the problem tho
[07:47] <apos> xfce would be a better option over unity
[07:48] <Ray> haha its because your hardware, probabky
[07:48] <cub> im sure because i used a fedora live cd on my laptop, which has better hardware, and it uses a gnome desktop like unity,
[07:48] <cub> ran fine
[07:48] <Guest24437> anyone?
[07:48] <cub> very fast even for livecd.. so i am sure its my hardware, but im trying to figure out a way to make the best
[07:48] <apos> then replace unity with xfce and be happy
[07:48] <cub> i used lxde , and kde, i dont like them
[07:48] <cub> lol
[07:49] <apos> or use fedora. not my cup of teea but its not terrible
[07:49] <eoin_> is fedora 18 any good haven't tried it yet
[07:49] <apos> ubuntu studio = god

[07:54] <cub> haha dr_willis, the donation would be appreciated for just one working one lol
[07:54] <dr_willis> I picked up 3 from the trash a few months back
[07:54] <Ray> haha
[07:54] <dr_willis> 1 of those worked..  ;)
[07:54] <cub> actually the machine i paid for was much better than this one, but the motherboard gave out
[07:54] <cri_> come funziona la vpn su xubuntu?
[07:54] <Ray> and you keep it dr_willis..?
[07:54] <cub> i was running ubuntu on it, had compiz and everythuing as my nvidia card was supported. But the guy got cheap

[07:55] <Ray> woohoo
[07:55] <dr_willis> They are all  going on the rummage sale in the spring.
[07:55] <cub> instead of fixing my machine he gave me another one of "equal value", without the video card", and less memory
[07:55] <cub> he gave me a larger hd  tho , which now is dying.. so
[07:55] <tim123> Thanks to everyone who helped me
[07:55] <dr_willis> 15gb was a larger hd?
[07:55] <dr_willis> thats scary
[07:55] <Ray> woow haha xD
[07:56] <cub> lol no actually i have a 80 gb hard drive on here
[07:56] <Ray> rofl
[07:56] <apos> any one have a 2.5" hard drive they could spare?
[07:56] <cub> yes it's still small, the original was 40 gb, he upgraded to 80 (he said for free), gave me less memory, and kept the nvidia graphics card...

[07:59] <inverse> how do i install WarCraft III on Ubuntu
[07:59] <inverse> :-/
[07:59] <Ray> dr_willis : alias
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[08:00] <Ray> dr_willis : alias for terminal
[08:00] <Ray> dr_willis : alias... the .bash file
[08:01] <Ray> im still missunderstand with the .profile
[08:03] <dr_willis> Ray:  thers numerous guides on making bash alias's for differnt things
[08:04] <dr_willis> Ray:  .profile is read at the first login i recall..  unless .bashrc exists
[08:04] <Ray> thats why ive said that im  not understand yet... its, to complicated but complex
[08:05] <dr_willis> i dont see whats complex about it... it reads .profile...    unless .bashrc exists.. then it uses .bashrc instead.
[08:05] <dr_willis> put some  'echo this is  .profile' at the top of the .profile file. and so on with other files to see whats getting loaded when
[08:05] <Ray> ok
[08:07] <Ray> should i add the Hashtag dr_willis..?
[08:07] <Ray> "#"
[08:07] <dr_willis> Ray:  Huh?
[08:07] <dr_willis>   You may want to read up on some bash scripting guides.
[08:07] <dr_willis> # this is a comment.. its not ran.
[08:08] <dr_willis> echo this is ran.. its a command..
[08:08] <Ray> oh... i see
[08:08] <dr_willis> # echo - this dosent get ran,....
[08:08] <dr_willis> this is very very much bash basics. ;)
[08:09] <Ray> how can i see the the command run?
[08:09] <dr_willis> see wht command run?
[08:09] <Ray> the 'echo this is  .profile' command.
[08:09] <dr_willis> that will get printed when you login
[08:09] <dr_willis> IF it runs .profile
[08:09] <dr_willis> logical eh?
[08:10] <Ray> what? partition?
[08:10] <Ray> i use primary for my ubuntu
[08:10] <dr_willis> Partition? huh? you seem to be jumping around..
[08:11] <Ray> i think "logical" thats it jumping to the partition

[08:11] <jrtappers> I have a strange X related problem. I have two X sessions running, changing from ctrl+alt+7 to ctrl+alt+8 blanks the 7 screen, but the other way round leaves the 8 screen frozen
[08:11] <Ray> if i log out now, the browser closed :/
[08:12] <dr_willis> open a new terminal - it will reread some of the bash init scripts
[08:12] <Ray> nothing happen
[08:13] <dr_willis> the aparently it didenbt run .profile ;)
[08:13] <dr_willis> since .profile is only ran by 'login shells'
[08:13] <jrtappers> I have two monitors, one X session on each
=== qos is now known as qos|away
[08:14] <Ray> ok i see, tks for the bash basic knowledge
[08:14] <dr_willis> ive never used seperate X sessions that way jrtappers .   so no  idea on it
[08:15] <jrtappers> dr_willis, I have integrated on open source drivers and a graphics card on propietary, so two X sessions is neccessary it seems
[08:15] <Ray> is there any channels talking about screenlet? i know this is funny but how it works -_-
[08:16] <Ray> wow, two graphics driver active?
[08:16] <dr_willis> you mean the screenlets desktop widgits?
[08:16] <jrtappers> Ray, yes
[08:16] <Ray> yeah
[08:16] <Ray> desktop widget
[08:17] <Ray> jrtappers : it might be crash or conflict
[08:17] <jrtappers> Ray, intel integrated on open source and a 7770 on closed source
[08:17] <Ray> no idea :/
[08:18] <jrtappers> Ray, its running now, its just odd that changing 7 to 8 blanks 7, but 8 to 7 leaves 8 frozen
[08:18] <jrtappers> Ray, so at the moment that screen is for things that do not change
[08:19] <Ray> im using single card and driver :/ jrtappers
[08:19] <Ray> this is insane
[08:19] <Ray> xD
[08:19] <jrtappers> Ray, so was I until yesterday, then I decided to try to get monitor 3 working
[08:20] <jrtappers> Ray, The cool thing is that I can have different window managers on the different screens
[08:21] <Ray> jrtappers : in single machine.?
[08:21] <hehateme> ive installed wine 1.5.5 through a tarball but my exe wont associate with wine and i dont have the option on a right click
[08:21] <jrtappers> Ray, yes
[08:22] <jrtappers> hehateme, have you tried installing wine program loader from the software center?
[08:22] <dr_willis> hehateme:  you mean you compiled from source?
[08:22] <Ray> its recommended you to install wine from aptitude or ubuntu soft. cent.
[08:22] <hehateme> yes i used ./tools/wine installer
[08:23] <antonio_> I
[08:23] <antonio_> I'm having a weird issue.  I was just using gimp...problem is one of the windows can
[08:24] <antonio_> can't be moved...the top of it is pushed over the top of the screen..like this http://s98.beta.photobucket.com/user/con_movies/media/Screenshotfrom2013-01-26222101_zps310cb887.png.html
[08:24] <antonio_> how can I adjust this?
[08:24] <hehateme> i had to install 1.5.5 cause its not in the software center only 1.5.2
[08:24] <dr_willis> alt-click on the window anywhere and drag it back perhaps?
=== ghost64 is now known as Guest89519
[08:24] <dr_willis> hehateme:  winehq has a ppa with newer versions I belive
[08:25] <hehateme> i used the ppa and only 1.5.2 is avalable on it
[08:25] <jrtappers> Is there a way to keep a TTY running in the background? That might be the first step
[08:25] <liquidmetal> I'm looking for an application indicator that can display the output of a shellscript I made - does anyone know something like that?
[08:25] <jrtappers> hehateme, why do you need 1.5.5?
[08:25] <Ray> whatt..??
[08:25] <antonio_> never mind, got it
[08:25] <Ray> yeah haha
[08:25] <dr_willis> theres example indicator-applets code writen in python ive seen on the askubuntu.com indicator-applet list
[08:25] <hehateme> i need it for the .net framework 4.0 that it can support
[08:26] <dr_willis> you can always fallback to running wine via the command line...   wine /path/to/your.exe
[08:26] <dr_willis> i rarely double click on a .exe to run it. ;)
[08:27] <Ray> Terminal-man
[08:27] <dr_willis> given the huge # of times wine fails ;)  double clicking often shows nothing.
[08:28] <kouriinu> i keep getting an (-5006 : 0x8000ffff)error when i try to install a game why
[08:28] <dr_willis> I can only think of like 2 apps i normally use in wine also. so i dont use it much any more
[08:28] <hehateme> i get an error message about stack overflow
[08:28] <dr_willis> kouriinu:  what game and how are you installing it?
[08:28] <liquidmetal> anyone know an appindicator for ubuntu that can display whatever I provide?
[08:28] <kouriinu> fall out 3 and i am trying to install it with wine
[08:29] <Ray> check for the compatibility at winehq
[08:29] <dr_willis> liquidmetal:  you mean an indicator-applet?  theres ones written in python you can change to do whatever you want
[08:29] <apos> it'll be the apocalypse by the time you get that running
[08:29] <jrtappers> liquidmetal, you could try using notify if you are at shell
[08:30] <apos> this year should be the start of linux gaming but it hasnt happened yet
[08:30] <Ray> its provided by steam??
[08:30] <dr_willis> hmm.. just saw some posting about CS and  Halflife on linux steam now...
[08:30] <liquidmetal> jrtappers: what do you mean notify?
[08:30] <kepler> apos, http://steamforlinux.com/
[08:30] <kouriinu> i dont know
[08:30] <apos> yes thats one of them

[08:32] <jrtappers> I would like L4D2 on steam for linux, that would be good, seeing as tit was theri first test game, and its not on the store
[08:32] <dr_willis> not even played L4D on windows. ;)  its too scary......
[08:32] <liquidmetal> dr_willis: I wrote a quick script that logs into my ISP can calculates the data I've used. It would be awesome if that number can show up on top and refresh every few hours or so.
[08:32] <jrtappers> timfrost, tried screen, this is to keep an X session running on a second monitor
[08:33] <wildc4rd> just with the resource use I can understand it, in windows, 2.5 gig of my 8 gig RAM is used just at desktop, with ubuntu its about 500 meg

[08:34] <dr_willis> liquidmetal:  you could also make it do a notification every 60 min.. if needed
[08:34] <liquidmetal> looking into that too... found this: http://www.eurion.net/python-snippets/snippet/Create%20an%20Application%20Indicator.html
[08:35] <liquidmetal> dr_willis: a more general question - how do decide if you want to put something in the top bar or the desktop?
[08:35] <timfrost> jrtappers: can't help then.  Xsession != TTY
[08:35] <Ray> gotcha
[08:35] <dr_willis> liquidmetal:  indicator-applets go in the top panel.  theres numerous widgits things like conky you can have drawn on the desktop
[08:35] <Ray> just logging in from xchat :D
[08:35] <jrtappers> timfrost, Just trying to get some clues
[08:36] <user_> test
[08:36] <user_> now im Ray
[08:37] <wildc4rd> is there any way I can get GKrellM to always be on top of other windows?
[08:37] <Chiko> what is the best way to have a program run on startup on ubuntu 12.04.1 lts ?
[08:37] <dr_willis> it used to have a dock mode wher it would make other windows resize around it ages ago wildc4rd .. not used it in years
[08:37] <user_> SCreenlet
[08:37] <Snakevincy> ciao
[08:38] <Snakevincy> !list
[08:38] <Chiko> also would be good to see the output of each program i've been using screen so far
[08:38] <dr_willis> getting out some of the old skool apps tonight. ;)
[08:38] <Chiko> just want something that will run on startup as well as in the background
[08:38] <wildc4rd> lol
[08:38] <dr_willis> Chiko:  what kind of program...
[08:38] <user_> background..?
[08:38] <dr_willis> Chiko:  its all in the details ;)
[08:38] <user_> it must be an Antivirus... if u use windows xD
[08:38] <kamidi> user_ (Ray) = TrollBot?
[08:39] <Chiko> didn't think that would apply but sure it's a server application that handles multiple connections whilst writing to the console showing server like information :P
=== atrius is now known as atrius_away
[08:39] <user_> what, Trollbot????
[08:39] <dr_willis> Chiko:   X app? terminal app? used by a user? or as root?
[08:39] <ZadYree> Hello!
[08:39] <Chiko> terminal app
[08:39] <liquidmetal> thanks dr_willis!
[08:40] <Chiko> user/root don't care probably root
=== user_ is now known as Ray
[08:40] <dr_willis> Chiko:   you could start it from /etc/rc.local  and spawn it as root or a user. and have it log to a file.. then just tail the log file as needed.
[08:40] <dr_willis> Chiko:  or spawn a screen session in rc.local for it. you could then connect to. if its more interactive
[08:40] <ZadYree> I'd like to know if there is an easy way of kernel upgrading, under 12.10
[08:40] <Chiko> screen may be better yeah
[08:41] <Chiko> so /etc/rc.local to launch whatever i want on startup?
[08:41] <dr_willis> ZadYree:  best to stick to the kernels in the repos.. there are some experimental kernel ppa's i belive.
[08:41] <dr_willis> Chiko:  that will run them on bootup yes.
[08:41] <Chiko> is there anything else? i'm under the impression there is several ways of doing this under linux
[08:41] <Chiko> something jobs~
[08:41] <dr_willis> theres always several ways to do somthing.. it depends on the details
[08:41] <kepler> cron jobs?
[08:41] <Chiko> yeah those
[08:42] <ZadYree> dr_willis, I assume a recent one would be more appropriate regarding my hardware
[08:42] <dr_willis> cron runs a command on a regular basis.. but  i dont rcall ever seeing cron used to start a screen session
[08:42] <kepler> cron is a scheduler, so it wont open something at startup...well, cron starts at startup, but the task occurs when it is told to
[08:42] <dr_willis> ZadYree:  you could always trh the ppas i guess.. or see if 13.04 newer kenrnel works.
[08:42] <ZadYree> Okay!
[08:42] <tigrakos> hello i have install rtorrent with webui in my server and its work fine when i install zpanel and i try to go mysite/rutorrent i get this SSL received a record that exceeded the maximum permissible length. ! thanks!
[08:43] <Chiko> yeah could come in handy for another app though
[08:43] <ZadYree> I thought it was possible to do with the native software set ;)
[08:43] <hehateme> i cant get wine completely off my system
[08:43] <Chiko> i have a health checker currently which just sits and checks the other apps every so often thinking it may be worthwhile to have it run and close handled by the cron..or not
[08:43] <dr_willis> ZadYree:  you can compile your own kernel.. you asked for  an EASY way
[08:44] <ZadYree> hehe, I may be lead to do that if it's the only solution :P
[08:44] <dr_willis> compiling your own kernel is not 'easy'
[08:44] <dr_willis> and you could test a newer kenrle via a 13.04 live cd. if you wanted to save some time
[08:44] <ZadYree> indeed
[08:45] <ZadYree> I may do this first
[08:45] <kepler> feature in the new kernel you need?
[08:45] <FlyOnZeWall> Chiko, when you say "apps", so you mean programs running in the GUI?
[08:45] <ZadYree> support for my laptop features
[08:46] <ZadYree> Had to code several syscalls which need to be called as root, so... key layouts may be better hehe
[08:46] <mvk> i had a little problem with ubuntu lastnight, my notebook was running out of battery while being DISCONnected from a powersource
[08:47] <mvk> then got stuck in a bootloop; i think it wanned to hibernate..
[08:47] <mhs> How to install and use Micromax 353g data card in Ubuntu 12.10?
[08:47] <Chiko> FlyOnZeWall: apps referring to programs i write in c++/c# that only work with the console
[08:47] <mvk> so i was waken up by the sound of my 2k laptop.. stuck in bootloop
[08:47] <mvk> you can imagine better ways to be woken up with..
[08:48] <Chiko> I'm not using the GUI just using a hosted vps
[08:48] <Chiko> and running services from it
[08:48] <mvk> how do i prefent my notebook from going into hibernation, are there any ways to test hibernation / check some log?
[08:48] <mvk> prevent
[08:50] <FlyOnZeWall> Chiko, ok, then for the record I'd like to state that "apps" is one of, if not the, most ambiguous trend word in the software development area atm =P
=== hayden_r_ is now known as hayden_ru
[08:51] <Chiko> I was just going for a general as the "app" isn't important :P
[08:52] <cirwin> everytime I log in, an Ubuntu One popup appears
[08:52] <cirwin> how do I stop it?
[08:52] <Chiko> I just wanted feedback on running things on startup =P
[08:52] <cirwin> :)
[08:52]  * cirwin takes the poor-man's approach to running things at startup. Assign them keyboard shortcuts :)
[08:53] <helmut_> hi
[08:57] <dr_willis> Chiko:  make your apps into actual servces that log to log files may be a better approach
[08:57] <dr_willis> unless they need tobe interactive
[08:59] <afendiosman> "Need to get 25.1 MB of archives. After this operation, 11.3 kB of additional disk space will be used."  ... why does this mean?
[08:59] <dr_willis> its downloading 25mb of updates.
[08:59] <dr_willis> it will install the updated and only 11.3k of more disk space will be used
[08:59] <hehateme> what does this mean?
[08:59] <hehateme> err:wincodecs:PngEncoder_CreateInstance Trying to save PNG picture, but PNG support is not compiled in
[08:59] <afendiosman> means the only needed update is that 11.3k ?
[09:00] <dr_willis> the binary/data files or whatever of that pacvkage have grown by 11k
[09:00] <dr_willis> hehateme:  and whats saying that? sounds like it dosent have png support compiled in.
[09:01] <inverse> where can i learn more about Ubuntu?

[09:02] <dr_willis> download whatever it is compiled with png support i guess...
[09:02] <dr_willis> since its a windows app in wine.. its not really s ubuntu limit as far as i can tell
[09:02] <afendiosman> ##winehq for wine specific problem
[09:03] <Chiko> dr_willis: for now i connect over ssh to monitor the current status of the server (updates real time) for future though it will handle api calls and i won't need to view it directly
[09:03] <afendiosman> err #winehq
[09:03] <us3r> how do i find out what version of ubuntu im running? 12.04?

[09:06] <User_> hello
[09:06] <ESphynx> ikonia: I'm stuck on the fact that my software is 219 commits apart from the version in Quantal, and at least 25% of those commits are important bug fixes

[09:07] <ikonia> ESphynx: apologies, are you trying to get packge updated to a higher version in quantal ?
[09:07] <ikonia> ESphynx: is that the end goal ?
[09:07] <ESphynx> ikonia: my main worry was that the package is uninstallable at the moment on Quantal/64 bit.

[09:08] <ESphynx> ikonia: but as April aproaches, my worry lessens (the problem is already fixed in Raring)
[09:08] <ikonia> ESphynx: sorry, I missed that as Gnomex flooded the channel, can you try again please.
[09:08] <ikonia> SomeGuy: ok - delete mint, install ubuntu, that's how you switch
[09:08] <dr_willis> SomeGuy:  thats a little vague. ;)
[09:08] <SomeGuy> Haha, ya I am having trouble uninstalling mint
[09:08] <Gnomex> i'm not FLood
[09:08] <Gnomex> :-w
[09:08] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  looks like you got a lot of ppas and other repos that are dead.
[09:08] <ikonia> ESphynx: if you have patches that can be included in the CURRENT quantel build, then raise a bug, attach the patches and do a build
[09:08] <apos> Gnomex,  !pastebin
[09:08] <ikonia> it will get reviewed
[09:08] <c0li> use pastebin then
[09:08] <Gnomex> How..?
[09:09] <ikonia> Gnomex: you just flooded the channel with 50 lines of text - you flooded
[09:09] <Chiko> pastebin.com
[09:09] <Gnomex> how can i solved tat

[09:09] <ikonia> ESphynx: if you're trying to get package bumpted from say version 1.2 to 1.4 - my personal view is you are wasting your time.
[09:09] <ESphynx> ikonia: basically, the latest version of the software would work on Quantal... but it's to have it accepted as an SRU that is the problem.
[09:09] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  why do you have all those ectra things added to your system? torproject and  offensive-security.com ?
[09:09] <SomeGuy> I am totally new to these Operating systems ha, running a dual boot at the moment, want to remove Mint without screwing up everything, couldnt find any solid info on how to remove mint properly
[09:09] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  step 1 would be to remove them from your pps's and sources.list
[09:09] <ikonia> ESphynx: are you trying to bump a package from version 1.2 -> 1.4 (for example)
[09:10] <apos> yeah get rid of those ppas since they dont work
[09:10] <dr_willis> SomeGuy:  tell the ubuntu installe rto install over it and reformat its partitions.. backup imporntant stuff first
[09:10] <dr_willis> SomeGuy:  or use gparted from a ubuntu cd. and reformat the partions.
[09:11] <dr_willis> or just delete the partions, and let the installer repartion as it wants
[09:11] <SomeGuy> dr_willis: Ok cool, so when I go to install Ubuntu it will give me the option to install over linux?
[09:12] <Gnomex> dr_willis how can i back to normal pps
[09:12] <dr_willis> the installer has advanced options where you can do whatever you want.

[09:12] <Gnomex> :(
[09:13] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  Huh? You dont want to mix repos from differnt  disrtos like that.
[09:13] <ikonia> Gnomex: with respect, you don't know how to run your OS, why are you trying to install security tools
[09:13] <ikonia> Gnomex: it's like trying to build an engine when you can't change a tire
[09:13] <Gnomex> yeah.. i know.. i'm wrong..
[09:13] <Gnomex> like try n error..
[09:13] <ikonia> Gnomex: I would suggest re-installing and getting back to a known good state
[09:14] <Gnomex> i'm just alone here nobody teach me..
[09:14] <ikonia> Gnomex: read
[09:14] <Gnomex> yeah i'm read manual..
[09:14] <ikonia> great, then you should have no problem
[09:14] <Gnomex> something i dunno what means all this..
[09:15] <Gnomex> btw i like Ubuntu..

[09:16] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  aparently you knew enough to add all those extra repos and ppas ..  time to remove them.. or backup your imporntant data. and reinstall a clean system  and condider it a lesson in not adding lots of stuff you dont need
[09:16] <ikonia> Gnomex: you are at a bad state,
[09:16] <Gnomex> i'm on Unity now.. can u tell me step by step..

[09:16] <apos> oops
[09:17] <ikonia> Gnomex: download ubuntu CD. Burn CD. Boot From CD, install ubuntu over broken install
[09:17] <Gnomex> :( to bad if i must reinstall back..
[09:18] <apos> Gnomex,  erase and clean install Ubuntu Studio. then go to https://www.trustedsec.com/downloads/social-engineer-toolkit/ and download backtrack and use unetbootin to "burn" backtrack onto a USB drive
=== VD is now known as Guest60840
[09:18] <apos> because who knows what else you might have done to that poor machine
[09:18] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  you are using backtrack now ?  or ubuntu? If you are planing on using backtrack.. i have to wonder WHY...
[09:19] <Gnomex> i'm just trying to install backtrack...
[09:19] <Gnomex> :(
[09:19] <apos> you dont "install" backtrack
[09:19] <dr_willis> Gnomex:   your original question had nothing to do with 'installing backtrack'
[09:19] <ikonia> Gnomex: then this channel is not for you
[09:19] <ikonia> Gnomex: try #backtrack-linux channel
[09:20] <Gnomex> Noo..
[09:20] <dr_willis> actually - isent backtrack ment to be ran from a live cd? not installed?
[09:20] <apos> you dont "install" backtrack
[09:20] <Gnomex> i'm try  to get back Normal Ubuntu
[09:20] <ikonia> Gnomex: then re-install ubuntu
[09:20] <Gnomex> coz cant Update my pakage
[09:20] <apos> i'd reinstall. you can no longer trust that machine
[09:20] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  best would be to reinstall.. who knows what all you have done to your system.
[09:20] <ikonia> Gnomex: you have 2 options 1.) install backtrack linux 2.) install ubuntu, which do you want
[09:21] <dr_willis> i would be 1/2 way done witn a ubuntu install in the time this chatting has been going on
[09:21] <apos> ^^
[09:21] <Gnomex> Ubuntu loor...
[09:21] <ikonia> Gnomex: you have 2 options 1.) install backtrack linux 2.) install ubuntu, which do you want
[09:21] <Gnomex> 2 Install Ubuntu
[09:21] <apos> you dont install backtrack...
[09:21] <Gnomex> Okey..
[09:22] <ikonia> Gnomex: right, download the ubuntu CD, burn it, boot from it, install it
[09:22] <Gnomex> backtrack not Good apos..??
[09:22] <ikonia> Gnomex: that is what you need to do
[09:22] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  why do you even think you need backtrack at all?
[09:22] <Gnomex> to bad if must reinstall back..
[09:22] <ikonia> Gnomex: ok - stop
[09:22] <ikonia> Gnomex: why are you talking about re-installing backtrack
[09:22] <apos> backtrack is a live operating system. you can run backtrack from USB or DVD using a disk imaging program like unetbootin or 'linux 'Live USB Creator.
[09:22] <dr_willis> Gnomex:  now you sound like a broken record.. come back when you  have ubuntu installed.
[09:22] <ikonia> Gnomex: you've just said you wanted to install ubuntu, not backtrack
[09:22] <Gnomex> Not reInstall BackTrack..
[09:22] <liquidmetal> dr_willis: have you written an app indicator like the system load indicator? How can I get the chart/graph thingy.
[09:23] <ikonia> apos: it's also a desktop install
[09:23] <Gnomex> u told me reInstall Ubuntu right
[09:23] <ikonia> Gnomex: yes.
[09:23] <dr_willis> liquidmetal:  nope. i rarely code.  I do recall some indicator-applets at the askubuntu.com site that were similer.
[09:23] <ikonia> Gnomex: so why are you talking about re-installing backtrack
[09:23] <apos> you can but you should NOT
[09:23] <ikonia> nonsense
[09:23] <ikonia> but that is not for this channel
[09:23] <Gnomex> sorry 1st i think  backtrack n ubuntu same system...
[09:24] <Gnomex> but i'm wrong..
[09:24] <Gnomex> :(
[09:24] <apos> ikonia as in the person who thinks ubuntu studio is not an ubuntu OS?
[09:24] <dr_willis> backtrack is not ubuntu..
[09:24] <ikonia> Gnomex: no, they are not
[09:24] <ikonia> Gnomex: so download ubuntu, install ubuntu, and forget about backtrack
[09:24] <ikonia> apos: what ?
[09:24] <Gnomex> i got old Cd Ubuntu..
[09:24] <ikonia> Gnomex: boot from it, install it
[09:24] <apos> arent you the guy who was telling ubuntu studio users they can get help here?
[09:24] <Brainiac> later I had installed the kernel 3.7 mt internet 3G do not install anymore! Any device?
[09:24] <ikonia> apos: no
[09:24] <Gnomex> then Update back pakage..??
[09:24] <dr_willis> Gnomex:   i suggest gettting the latest ubuntu 12.10 version if your cd is very old.
[09:25] <ikonia> Brainiac: 3.7 is not a supported kernel in ubuntu
[09:25] <ikonia> Brainiac: 3.5 is the current supported kernel
[09:25] <Guest24437> hey
[09:25] <Gnomex> can u give link to Download 12.10 lts

[09:26] <ubottu> Brainiac: linux-image (source: linux-meta): Generic Linux kernel image.. In component main, is optional. Version 3.5.0.22.28 (quantal), package size 1 kB, installed size 32 kB
[09:27] <ikonia> Brainiac: as you can see 3.5 is the current stable kernel image from the official repos

[09:27] <dr_willis> Guest24437:  look again.. ive ve seen very few bios's that dont have that feature. Or at the very start/power up ther may be some F keys. or bs, or del, or esc. that may bring up a menu
[09:27] <ikonia> Brainiac: I strongly suggest verifying information before installing software suggested on peoples blogs
[09:27] <Guest24437> yes i get this by using f12 but there is only my "c" drive dvd usb lan etc
[09:28] <Guest24437> no other hard drive
[09:28] <dr_willis> Guest24437:   you can put grub on the other hd if you wanted to.
[09:28] <Brainiac> Thanks a lot. I will see that carefully! I am re-installing.
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[09:28] <dr_willis> Brainiac:  or just use the grub menu to select an older kernel
[09:28] <ikonia> dr_willis: it will still be installed
[09:28] <ikonia> dr_willis: and still have updated headers etc
[09:28] <studio-user661> anyone up who has some fair experience getting dualbooting working right? Trying to get Ubuntu studio 12.10 and slackware-14 to play nicely, and using a shared /home with different uid/logins on the different distros
[09:28] <dr_willis> then he can try to remove it..
[09:29] <Gnomex> hey can u give me direct link to Download it..?? my english not well.. sorry
[09:29] <Guest24437> i know but sinnce i just want to test it is more cobvenient not to touch windoof bootloader#
[09:29] <Gnomex> :(
[09:29] <dr_willis> but we dont know what he did.
[09:29] <ikonia> studio-user661: you are going to have a hard time
[09:29] <studio-user661> why's that? ikonia?
[09:29] <ikonia> studio-user661: 1.) using different uid's is going to cause problems 2.) dual booting with ubuntu's grub2 build and a seperate linux distro will cause pain
[09:29] <Guest24437> dr_willis i can tell u exactly what i did shall i?
[09:29] <dr_willis> Guest24437:  i always boot from my 2nd hard drive.. if you cant figure out the bios settings.. well.. we cant really walk ya through it.
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[09:29] <dr_willis> theres so many varity in bios's
[09:30] <Brainiac> How can I do it? Recuperation mode?
[09:30] <Guest24437> i know but i really ont find the setting xD
[09:30] <ikonia> Brainiac: where did you get the 3.7 kernel
[09:30] <dr_willis> Guest24437:  power down.. unplug the first HD. ;) power up.. see if it boots the 2nd hd.
[09:30] <ikonia> mainline vanilla ?
[09:30] <Guest24437> that one thing i want to avoid since my machine is nicely hidden ;-)
[09:31] <Guest24437> in bootmenu i only get "hard drive" but no further selction
[09:31] <Brainiac> In a site!
[09:31] <ikonia> Brainiac: tell you what, you want ot be cryptic with me, help yourself
[09:32] <ikonia> Brainiac: I'm asking reasonable questions such as "where did you get this software as it's not in the official ubuntu repos" - you want to give clever responses like "from a site!" - good luck with your problems
[09:34] <Guest24437> seems no1 can help me?
[09:34] <Brainiac> I'm sorry ikonia. Was not from a official repositoy. How i say, i saw in a blog of ubuntu things, a many people did the same. I really do not remember the blog!!
[09:35] <Brainiac> Can I just select the old kernel?
[09:36] <lukasz> Hi! Im newbie. I work with dual monitors. I want to disable vertical toolbar on second monitor. Its possible?
[09:37] <serp_> vertical?
[09:37] <Brainiac> ikonia, can I? just select?
[09:37] <leebtron> ikonia: studio_user here, I use different logins and uids to keep the config files seperate in the /home/username folders, and then remap/hardlink/symlink the /movies, /music/ documents, etc subfolders to communal folders on a seperate partition
[09:37] <lukasz> hmmm I dont know corect name for it
[09:37] <ikonia> Brainiac: sorry - I'm not progressing this any more, you're package will probably have downloaded now headers etc, and you want to provide no iformation, so I don't want to help
[09:38] <ikonia> leebtron: yes, and that will still cause you problems as /home must be owned by the same uid/gid
[09:38] <ikonia> leebtron: unless I'm not understanding what you are doing when you say a shared home
[09:38] <leebtron> kk
[09:39] <lukasz> serp_: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Hht7VZ29XgM/TTTSuhvpJoI/AAAAAAAAY1A/sO0_DAaEvZk/s1600/unity1.png
[09:39] <lukasz> on the left side you can see toolbar .... Vertical stripe with icons
[09:40] <Brainiac> ikonia, what information shoud I provide?
[09:40] <nibbler> anyone good with digikam? i'm importing my pics which i managed with f-spot before. the tags, which seems to be saved in the xmp/Subject field, are comma sperated. now when importing it sometimes gives me several distinct tags, and for some pictures only one long tag, including several commas... how to control this?
[09:40] <lukasz> I want to disable it on one of my monitors
[09:40] <ikonia> Brainiac: ask the channel, I'm out
[09:40] <dr_willis> lukasz:  theres settings somewher to show/hide it on one or both montitors
[09:41] <dr_willis> lukasz:  i just cant rember where.
[09:41] <leebtron> basically, I have a 128GB SSD HDD in this laptop with 8 GB /dev/sda1 for swap, 16GB /dev/sda2 in ext4 for slackware '/', 24GB /dev/sda3 in ext4 for UStudio '/', and the remaining 80GB or so in /dev/sda4 as an ext3 for /home on both slackware and UStudio.
[09:41] <dr_willis> lukasz:  a quick serach at askubuntu.com should show you
[09:41] <ikonia> leebtron: then they need to share the same uid/gid
[09:41] <Brainiac> Thank you ikonia! you are really weird!
[09:41] <Brainiac> I am! I will try on my own!
[09:41] <dr_willis> I recall it being a easially iverlooked pulldown menu item on the monitors or displays or some semi-related setting dialog
[09:43] <leebtron> I use different logins for the different os's, so they technically have separate folders inside /dev/sda4, but I also have created /dev/sda4/Documents, /dev/sda4/Downloads, /dev/sda4/movies, etc; and inside both os's I have symlinked or hardlinked /home/slackwareuser/movies to /home/movies.... so the folders appear transparently, yet are both accessible from either side
[09:43] <ikonia> leebtron: /home is the key thing, not the directories under it
[09:44] <leebtron> I don't have any issue with my data management, outside of getting thunar to mate well with my networked RAID box...
[09:45] <leebtron> I don't have a problem dealing with home ikonia
[09:45] <czar> i may have just been hacked
[09:45] <ikonia> leebtron: so what's the issue you actually need help with ?
[09:45] <czar> i was just hacked via desktop sharing, some commands were run on my terminal
[09:45] <leebtron> tthe problem i'm having is getting lilo to properly chainload into Ubuntu's GRUB2, and/or keeping slackware 14.0 from getting screwy when it's booted from GRUB2
[09:46] <czar> will someone check out the commands for me to see what i need to clear it up
[09:46] <ikonia> czar: re-install ubuntu then
[09:46] <ikonia> czar: do not paste the commadns
[09:46] <ikonia> czar: if you feel you have been compromised, re-install ubuntu
[09:46] <ikonia> we do not want to see them
[09:46] <czar> :(
[09:46] <apos> its no longer trusted
[09:46] <apos> needs to be removed from the network
[09:46] <czar> are other computers on my network also compromised?
[09:47] <bekks> czar: Maybe.
[09:47] <ikonia> czar: remove it now to remove risk
[09:47] <czar> ok done
[09:47] <dr_willis> hacked via desktop shareing.. err.. so they guessed your password?
[09:47] <leebtron> my /home directories operate perfectly well, and maintain data transparently throughout both operating systems. I'mnot trying to get something silly like using the same login across the OS's while retaining the same inode for /home.... that's just asking fro trouble
[09:47] <czar> password wasnt enabled, the computer wasnt supposed to be connected
[09:47] <czar> to the net
[09:48] <dr_willis> so they got into a user account? or were you running as root?
[09:48] <czar> user acct
[09:48] <dr_willis> well you can do what you want. but the most sure/safest thing would be a reinstall..
[09:49] <leebtron> czar: what services are you running as user?
[09:49] <lukasz> I have one more question,. How is simplest way to actualize firefox?
[09:49] <ikonia> actualize ?
[09:49] <lukasz> (I'm newbie)
[09:49] <czar> firefox is actualized
[09:49] <czar> next question
[09:49] <ikonia> what does actualize mean
[09:49] <lukasz> I have firefox 15
[09:49] <dr_willis> if root was not comprimized and you dident have any special user rights going on.. it should have only hurt the users home files
[09:49] <lukasz> 15.0
[09:49] <lukasz> Current firefox is 18.0
[09:49] <czar> is root a specific user
[09:49] <dr_willis> !firefox
[09:49] <ubottu> firefox is the default web browser on Ubuntu. To install the latest version, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion | To install plugins: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxPlugins
[09:50] <czar> i use one acct for everything
[09:50] <ikonia> czar: re-install
[09:50] <ikonia> what does actualize firefox mean ?
[09:50] <dr_willis> czar:  if your ubuntu level is such that you have to ask what root is.. id say backup/reinstall and next time set passwords..
[09:50] <dr_willis> !root
[09:50] <ubottu> Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[09:50] <czar> reinstall as in format root partition?
[09:51] <dr_willis> czar:  yes.  - backup any imporntant user files first
[09:51] <czar> i have files on a seperate partition
[09:51] <czar> "/home"
[09:51]  * dr_willis wonders why a desktop system that was supposed to be not on the network..  had desktop shareing enabled...
[09:52] <dr_willis> its possible your users own personal files have been damaged also.. i would check them out
[09:52] <czar> some pedantic fags in here tonight
=== someone is now known as Guest70440
[09:52] <dr_willis> if they havent been jsut deleted
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[09:53] <leebtron> czar: what services do you have enabled as user? if you're running wifi, and have rdesktop or something similar running at the same time, then it's possible that someone could have networked directly to you on an open socket
[09:54] <leebtron> ikonia, are you familiar with lilo/GRUB2?
[09:54] <ikonia> leebtron: certainly seperatly, I don't use them to do what you want to do, I don't like the concept of what you are trying to do (personally)
[09:55] <leebtron> which is what, do you think?
[09:55] <ikonia> chainload grub2 from lilo
[09:55] <leebtron> I am not certain that you completely understand what I'm sttempting to do
=== asus is now known as Guest67348
[09:56] <leebtron> the only reason for that is that I vastly prefer lilo to GRUB2, but I haven't figured out how to install UbuntuStudio without also installing GRUB2
[09:56] <ikonia> there is a box in the installer that says "don't install bootloader" or words to that effect
[09:56] <lukasz> I cant find a package with latest firefox ...
[09:56] <ikonia> I assume that's been carried across to the ubuntu studio installer also
[09:57] <dr_willis> lukasz:  there used to  be PPA's with daily builds and  other newer versions.
[09:57] <leebtron> I haven't seen it there, it's a selection menu that allows for install to /dev/sda, or to one of the partitions under it
[09:57] <ikonia> looks like it's removed as an option then
[09:59] <leebtron> in which case I've installed it to /dev/sda3, my UStudio partition. If I attempt to load UStudio directly from lilo, it will boot up, butI am unable to use mouse or keyboard.
[10:00] <DigitRig> is it possible to add a user using usermod -G to group root?
[10:00] <ikonia> DigitRig: sure
[10:00] <DigitRig> and will it give root privileges to root chown (group) directories?
[10:00] <ikonia> DigitRig: no
[10:00] <leebtron> if I use GRUB2 as the primary bootloader, installed to /dev/sda; then slackware acts funky, and things just don't quite work right
[10:00] <ikonia> DigitRig: its a group, not owner
[10:00] <DigitRig> ikonia, but if the directory is chownd to root:root then isn't root also the group?
[10:01] <leebtron> DigitRig: I'm not sure what you're trying to make work, but it sounds like you'd be better off using sudo
[10:01] <DigitRig> leebtron it's over sftp so I can't actually issue any commands
[10:02] <leebtron> aha
[10:02] <leebtron> your ftp server?
[10:02] <DigitRig> well, an ec2 instance I am sftp editing files on....
[10:03] <leebtron> or are you trying to get privledge escalation on another ftp server?
[10:03] <DigitRig> uhh I dont think so?
[10:04] <leebtron> can you modify the permissions of the sftp login on the server?
[10:04] <DigitRig> hmm, I'll try that, thaks leebtron
[10:07] <vanosten> .
[10:07] <leebtron> DigitRig: if you canmodify permissions on the server's files, you shouldbe able to use SUID or SGID on the necesasary files' permissions which would be able to give you root's permissions with those files without actually giving you root permissions
[10:08] <Pranas> hi guys. how to trace error if I get black screen after login?
[10:09] <dr_willis> Pranas:  tried the  nomodeset option yet?
[10:09] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[10:09] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[10:10] <Pranas> dr_willis: nomodeset means very basic graphics mode, am I right?
[10:10] <dr_willis> nope
[10:10] <dr_willis> it tells the kernel to do somthing differntly i recall.
[10:10] <Pranas> I used nomodeset to install my 12.04 , because otherwise it would hang
[10:10] <lukasz> I want to install latest firefox. Im there:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion#Firefox-stable_channel
[10:11] <dr_willis> ive ran for months with nomodsset witn ho issues
[10:11] <lukasz> Im clickink link in first point
[10:11] <dr_willis> no issues
[10:11] <lukasz> whot next ?
[10:11] <lukasz> *what next ?
[10:11] <Pranas> do you happen to have nvidia graphics card?
[10:11] <dr_willis> i only have nvidia. ;) well netbooks are on intel
[10:13] <Pranas> so I probably should look into this nomodeset. and other than that just default updated packages.
=== VD is now known as Guest10010
[10:13] <dr_willis> lukasz:  what version of FF are you looking for?
[10:14] <Pranas> btw, I tried nvidia-current package. after that ubuntu gives me black screen like 30% of the time. at other times it's fine
[10:14] <dr_willis> Pranas:  thats weird that its not all the time.
[10:15] <dr_willis> FF 18.0.1 is the latest? thats what i have on my ubuntu box
[10:15] <lukasz> dr_willis: LAtest - 18.0

[10:22] <liquid-silence> moving to ubuntu on my imac
[10:22] <liquid-silence> is the amd64-mac disk ok?
[10:23] <lukasz> Im trying to upgarde ubuntu to 12.10
[10:25] <captine> liquid-silence, haven't installed it on iMac.  but my friends mac mini couldn't do 64bit due to it's EFI chip.
[10:26] <liquid-silence> ok I will check
[10:26] <arun> hi guys
[10:26] <captine> liquid-silence, 64 Bit should be fine if you have a iMac that can run native 64bit kernel.  not sure if any of them suffer from the restrictions as the mac mini's did
[10:26] <lukasz> smokingfreak: Im in firefox extracted package folder
[10:26] <liquid-silence> captine: because archlinux refuses to work
[10:26] <arun> i cannot remove pdf copyright security from my pdf file
[10:26] <lukasz> and im typing in terminal "./configure"
[10:26] <lukasz> dont work ....
[10:28] <captine> liquid-silence, how old is ur iMac?  As i said, i have never installed on an iMac (bought a mac mini 2012 server to run proxmox on, but havent gotten around to it yet

[10:35] <bruno__> hi
[10:35] <captine> liquid-silence, ok. what terminal are you in then?  are you planning to install from usb or CD?  which version of ubuntu you downloading?  12.04.01 or 12.10?
[10:35] <Dan1987> Hi all, Ive just done an upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10 through the update-manager. All went well during upgrade but on first log-in i have no Unity Desktop. All i have is the background. Any advice on what i can do? Cheers
[10:36] <ted___> Hello, I can't access my user and am unable to mount my private directory. Could anyone help?
[10:36] <liquid-silence> DVD
[10:36] <liquid-silence> but I am on a botched archlinux

[10:37] <ted___> My boot got messed up so I'm trying to transfer the data from it using a live CD.
[10:37] <liquid-silence> killing time now
[10:37] <liquid-silence> about 30 minutes for the download to be completed
[10:38] <ted___> Does anyone know a way to access your data when your machine won't boot?
[10:39] <apos> linux live disk
[10:39] <ted___> Using one.
[10:39] <liquid-silence> mount the device
[10:39] <ted___> Need a little more detail, please.
[10:39] <apos> then whats ur problem?
[10:39] <captine> liquid-silence, ok.  I installed ubuntu on friends old mac mini few weekends ago and it went really smoothly.  Am sure once the DVD is burnt the install will go smoothly
[10:39] <ted___> The drive is encrypted.
[10:39] <liquid-silence> captine: I think so too
[10:39] <liquid-silence> except for ATI
[10:39] <k1l> ted___: start a ubuntu live system (like on a cd/dvd or on a usb-stick). then you could easily click-to-mount the partitions in the nuatilus file explorer
[10:39] <liquid-silence> ATI is the dogs breakfast
[10:40] <apos> the drive is encrypted. you best bet is to attack the key.
[10:40] <k1l> ted___: if its encrypted im out of the business
[10:40] <liquid-silence> captine: used the mac iso?

[10:42] <bilel> hi, I've installled ubuntu 11.10 and grub2 yesterday, now I've juste fogured out windows can't even be booted anymore, the windows loader appears on the list, but when I click on it, it says "Secure Boot forbids loading module from /boo/grub/x86_64-efi/ntfs.mod", I can only boot ubuntu...
[10:42] <k1l> ted___: maybe you need to install the encryption tools ubuntu brings in the repos to encrypt the partition. but im not sure because i dont use encryption
[10:43] <k1l> apos: no need for hacking with external tools in that case
[10:43] <crawln> can anyone help me with avconv
[10:43] <ted___> No...it's got everything it needs right there. my credentials just aren't lining up.
[10:43] <apos> you dont know what your talking about
[10:43] <crawln> trying to convert an entire folder of mkv to mp4
[10:43] <Nickinator> By the sounds of it you're either using TrueCrypt or Bitlocker, and most "hacking" tools won't crack that (in less than a decade anyway)
[10:43] <apos> and neither do you
[10:44] <apos> so it seems i should keep my mouth shut as this conversation isnt appropriate for freenode.
[10:44] <arun> hey guys which is the best pdf editor
[10:44] <arun> ????/
[10:44] <ted___> apos, I tried to follow this fix: http://goshawknest.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/how-to-recover-crypted-home-directory-in-ubuntu/
[10:44] <ted___> That just leads me to believe it can be more simple than attacking it.
[10:45] <ted___> You're right though...I'm not very knowledgable.
[10:45] <arun> hey guys any one
[10:45] <arun> help me yaar
[10:45] <arun> which is the best pdf editor?????/
[10:45] <ted___> I don't know arun, I don't use pdfs. Sorry.
[10:46] <bekks> !best | arun
[10:46] <ubottu> arun: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[10:47] <arun> hey by which can i edit the copyright pdf
[10:49] <bekks> arun: Hopefully by none. A copyright should be respected.
[10:49] <kostkon> arun, there are a couple in the software centre. have you checked?
[10:49] <kostkon> arun, pdf editors*
[10:49] <BlackWeb> I've been looking into Encryption, Which I've been using GPG, But heard about Openssl AES256, Is OpenSSL AES256 More secure then GPG or are they Similar?
[10:50] <BlackWeb> Is OpenSSL mainly used to encrypt with Ciphers
[10:50] <apos> itsd illegal to enter or leave the USA
[10:50] <ted___> Do I honestly have to "hack" my own computer? I can't believe that it's set up so that when your boot breaks you're screwed.
[10:51] <apos> you ENCRYPTED it
[10:51] <k1l> ted___: you need to specifiy where exactly you have problems.
[10:51] <ted___> What do you want to know k1l?
[10:51] <cgtdk> apos: No one cares about export restrictions on cryptography
[10:51]  * rudrab says hello to all
[10:51] <arun> hey isn't there any way to remove copyright restriction from a pdf?
=== qos|away is now known as qos
[10:52] <k1l> ted___: you said you followed the tutorial you linked. so where is the problem in there?
[10:52] <cgtdk> arun: You've already asked several times.
[10:52] <arun> sorrry
[10:52] <Soopah> ask google
[10:52] <cgtdk> Soopah: or DuckDuckGo
[10:52] <arun> but no one ansered the question
[10:52] <ted___> I got to the 21st line...and instead of working like the example...I got the same error.
[10:52] <kostkon> arun, you aren't going to get help for that here. nevertheless, if yotu want to edit your pdf file, check the pdf editors that are available in the usc
[10:52] <rudrab> friends, am i in right place to ask about ubuntu devices (i.e. phone) specially? or there is any dedicated channel?
[10:52] <arun> I googled a lot
[10:52] <BlackWeb> Apos is OpenSSL AES256 Encryption More Secure Than GPG
[10:53] <BlackWeb> just curious
[10:53] <arun> pok
[10:53] <arun> ok
[10:53] <k1l> !phone | rudrab
[10:53] <ubottu> rudrab: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[10:53] <arun> thanks
[10:53] <BlackWeb> I use GPG with keys
[10:53] <ted___> Of course, mine didn't look exactly like the example, because I used this tutorial: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/ubuntu-63/mounting-hard-drive-from-live-cd-558177/ to mount it
[10:53] <apos> most encryption is limited to 56bit or 128bit eliptic curve because America wont let you inport or export higher.
[10:54] <ted___> so everything I was doing had a /mnt/mountpoint prefix.
[10:54] <rudrab> ubottu: thanks.
[10:54] <ubottu> You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)
[10:54] <apos> beyound that its all about the algorythem in use
[10:55] <apos> and i need to leave now. i am in violation of some non disclosure pacts in several rooms. not to mention im sure ubuntu code of conduct has something to say about giving support whist drunk
=== ryanclancy000 is now known as Guest16061
[10:55] <BlackWeb> Alright, So OpenSSL is mainly used to encrypt with password cipers, & gpg with keys right?
[10:56] <cgtdk> BlackWeb: What do you need encryption for?
[10:56] <a5h15h> using xubuntu 12.04...the pointer disappears after inactivity...any fix?
[10:57] <BlackWeb> Mainly Bank Stmt that I download instead of receiving papermail, want to secure them on drive so Tar/Zip them into file and just checking on encrypting the archive
[10:57] <k1l> ted___: did you mount the /home partition as /home?
[10:57] <BlackWeb> Mainly Financial records
[10:58] <ted___> It ended up being /mnt/mountpoint/home
[10:58] <BlackWeb> cgtdk, I've been using GPG using keys,
[10:58] <ted___> I'm not sure how to make it work otherwise.
[10:58] <BlackWeb> then heard about openssl does openssl just encrpyt mainly with cipers?
[10:58] <a5h15h> have searched on the web...leading to a package called unclutter...but i dont have it installed...
[10:58] <cgtdk> BlackWeb: PGP/GPG and AES are both very secure and they should both be fine for your purpose.
[10:58] <cgtdk> I usually use GPG though
[10:58] <apos> ^^
[10:59] <apos> on both accounts
[10:59] <apos> just dont use a gpg key you reg'd publicly  XD
[10:59] <BlackWeb> Alright, ya I'm using GPG now using keys, Which Openssl it that mainly just used for creating encryption with ciphers without the keys
[10:59] <k1l> ted___: for the tutorial you follow you need to mount it to /home not /.../.../home
=== Vampire0_ is now known as Vampire0
[11:00] <ted___> Oh...well I don't know how to do that.
[11:00] <k1l> ted___: the mount command you used, what did it look like?
[11:01] <BlackWeb> Can Gpg Decrypt a file Encrypted with OPenSSL
[11:01] <ted___> Just "mount" but see...when I try to mount it without making a directory first...it just says "Yep, it's already mounted!"
[11:01] <cgtdk> BlackWeb: No
[11:01] <ted___> That was dense of me...hold on I'll get better info.
[11:02] <BlackWeb> Alright kinda figured that but ya its cool, Downloaded some files from net from anonymous Encrypted with AES256
[11:02] <ted___> mkdir /mnt/mountpoint     then  mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/mountpoint
[11:02] <k1l> ted___: well, if you used the mount command mentioned in that forumthread, it should have looked like "mount /dev/sdXY /mountoint" just the mountpoint needs to say "/home"
[11:03] <Kaleo> Good morning! I would like to know how can I fix a problem with my 12.10 QQ kernel. I just want uninstall a recent and install the 3.5!
[11:04] <ted___> You lost me...I'm sorry I'm trying to follow.
[11:04] <ted___> What part did I do wrong?
[11:04] <k1l> ted___: yes, there is the problem. fot the recovery of the encrypted home you need to mount that partition to /home and not /mnt/mountpoint
[11:05] <ted___> I don't know how.
[11:05] <dr_willis> !mount
[11:05] <ubottu> mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
[11:05] <k1l> ted___: just change your command to "mount /dev/sda1 /home"  _if_ that encrypted home partition is the sda1 partition
[11:05] <ted___> oh...oh! let me try that!
[11:05] <k1l> but before you need to unmount that old mount command
[11:06] <ted___> Oh, okay...would that be "unmount"
[11:06] <computer1> does anyone here work on the LibreOffice build..?
[11:06] <dr_willis> umount   no n
[11:06] <ted___> Thank you dr_willis :)
[11:06] <ted___> be right back!
[11:06] <k1l> yes, without the first n

[11:08] <Kaleo> Do not have people here? (sarcasm)
[11:08] <dr_willis> hmm. whats a qq kernel
[11:08] <dr_willis> never heard the term
[11:09] <moltevolte> hi
[11:09] <dr_willis> and the question is a little confuseing
[11:09] <Kaleo> dr_willis - i'm back!
[11:09] <dr_willis> moo!
[11:10] <Kaleo> dr_willis: Can you help-me?
[11:10] <dr_willis> i have no idea what you are asking.
[11:11] <dr_willis> and the question is a little confuseing
[11:12] <Kaleo> I want uninstall a recent kernel and back to courrent version: 3.5 of the Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal Quetzal.
[11:12] <ted___> k1l I unmounted, then mounted like you said...I hit enter and it didn't say anything...just went to another command line.
[11:12] <ted___> Didn't change the directory or anything.
[11:12] <k1l> ted___: there is no report when it went through
[11:12] <bilel> after ubuntu installation, grub2 was missing, so I launched boot repair (http://paste.ubuntu.com/1572862/), now I can't boot windows anymore, when I select it on the grub list, I get "Secure boot forbids loading module from /bootgrub/x86_64-efi/ntfs.mod", do you know why? thanks for your help I don't know what to do now
[11:13] <k1l> no try the other tutoorial again
[11:13] <ted___> I can't?
[11:13] <k1l> why?
[11:13] <ted___> It didn't put me in the directory.
[11:13] <dr_willis> if you used the package manager to install the kernels. the  use it to uninstall what you dont want
[11:13] <k1l> you dont need to be in that directory
[11:13] <ted___> but that's what the tutorial says?
[11:14] <Kaleo> Was installed from terminal - wget!!
[11:14] <k1l> ted___: this? http://goshawknest.wordpress.com/2010/04/16/how-to-recover-crypted-home-directory-in-ubuntu/
[11:14] <Kaleo> I do not have the address anymore
[11:14] <ted___> When I mount using /mnt/mountpoint....my command line changes to include the directory.
[11:14] <ted___> when I mount like you said...I'm still stuck in root@ubuntu.
[11:14] <dr_willis> wget downloads files.. it dosent install stuff.
[11:14] <k1l> ted___: no forget those forumthread with the /mnt/mountpoint stuff
[11:15] <ted___> I understand it isn't right...but as an example.
[11:15] <bekks> ted___: root@ubuntu is a prompt, it does not tell you anything about the path you are in.
[11:15] <Kaleo> ch mod.... from a comand!
[11:15] <ted___> bekks I might not be using the correct terminology but do you know what I mean?
[11:15] <dr_willis> Kaleo:  chmod dosent install stuff either. it chamges file modes
[11:16] <k1l> ted___: so start the commands that are mentioned in that last code-box on the tutorial
[11:16] <bekks> ted___: No, to be honest.
[11:16] <ted___> the tutorial shows you being in your home directory...the command line/prompt..."displaying" that you're "in" the directory.
[11:16] <k1l> ted___: there is no need to got to an directory at the start of that tutorial, as far as i can see
[11:17] <Kaleo> Guys, how can I uninstall a kernel easily from terminal?
[11:17] <ted___> Alright k1l I'm going to give it a whirl.
[11:18] <ted___> wait yes it does.
[11:18] <ted___> Right at the beginning of the tutorial you see a # after /home/username
[11:18] <iceroot> Kaleo: sudo apt-get remove linux-image- TAB TAB to see als install kernels
[11:18] <iceroot> Kaleo: dont remove the generic package from linux-image
[11:18] <iceroot> Kaleo: linux-image-generic
[11:18] <ted___> Or is that part of the command, I'm understanding it wrong?
[11:19] <k1l> ted___: that is because the user stated at the beginning of the tutotrial, that he could not use his home because its encrypted and to show that he already changed into that directory.
[11:19] <k1l> ted___: you are looking in the wrong direction in this part. just keep moving
[11:19] <ted___> It doesn't work.
[11:20] <ted___> It says the directory doesn't exist.
[11:20] <Kaleo> iceroot: I want install just one yhat i have installed!
[11:21] <Kaleo> "That"... 3.7 version.
[11:21] <Kaleo> iceroot: Thank you!
[11:21] <k1l> ted___: hmm. im not sure if its because you mounted the wrong partition or the wrong mountpoint or smth other :/
[11:22] <k1l> ted___: where did it not work exactly?
[11:22] <ted___> Right at the beginning? I expected when you told me to mount that way...I'd get something like root@ubuntu: /home/user#
[11:23] <k1l> ted___: no
[11:23] <ted___> Just like the example...instead I mounted and it doesn't say anything...just root@ubuntu:#~
[11:23] <ted___> Which doesn't look like the example at all.
[11:23] <k1l> mounting smth doesnt mean you get there instantly
[11:23] <ted___> So okay...how do I get there?
[11:23] <k1l> ted___: you dont need to get there
[11:23] <ted___> In the tutorial the guy is there.
[11:23] <ted___> That's where he starts.
[11:24] <k1l> thats what im talking about. you need to do the commands mentioned at the start . no matter where you are
[11:24] <k1l> ted___: the commands he is doing dont need a place
[11:24] <k1l> so dont stop at that meaningless point
=== esy is now known as Neshemah
[11:24] <ted___> Then why does he show himself using the commands in a place...and when I'm not in a place...theyy don't work?
[11:25] <k1l> ted___: last time not: adding a user to the system doesnt need a place to get started
[11:25] <ted___> how come when I use /mnt/mountpoint...it changes the directory...and I can get halfway through the tutorial.
[11:25] <k1l> *now
[11:26] <k1l> ted___: ok. i quit. you dont listen to what i try to help you and keep doing the wrong commands. so hopefully omeone other got more luck in helping you.

[11:54] <eric_hungern> unuity is good. it is like mac os global menu but i wold like to place it in the bottom
[11:54] <eric_hungern> i hate dash menu
[11:54] <cgtdk> I prefer the freedom of simply using a standalone window manager
[11:55] <eric_hungern> it would be great if there is way to remove the dash
[11:55] <eric_hungern> ah yes cgtdk but you know gnome 3x is terrbile
[11:55] <eric_hungern> kde always crahes and consumes too much ram
[11:55] <eric_hungern> gnome 2x is old so unity is good

[11:58] <bekks> !info admuncher
[11:58] <ubottu> Package admuncher does not exist in quantal
[11:59] <fedor> i know that. That's why i've written alternative
[11:59] <eric_hungern> i wonder what is the new features in the next lts
[11:59] <bekks> fedor: I dont even know what admuncher is, so I was hoping to get some info from ubottu :)
[11:59] <eric_hungern> how can i learn
[11:59] <fedor> that's an addblocker
[11:59] <meet> i am using gnome shell. in the bottom notification bar which is shown in the overview, i want to remove the removable drives icon. how to do that?
[12:00] <bekks> eric_hungern: There are two releaseto go until the next LTS is going to be planned.
[12:00] <eric_hungern> 13.04?
[12:00] <bekks> eric_hungern: No. 14.04 will be LTS.
[12:00] <eric_hungern> hm ok
[12:01] <bekks> fedor: Where, if not in a browser, could ads be seen? :)
[12:01] <iceroot> is there a way i can send keyboard and mouse-events over ssh to an existing x-server? so that i have remote keyboard and remote-mouse? (dont need to see the screen, juust want to interacte with the x-server)
[12:01] <ted___> http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2009/03/mounting-your-encrypted-home-from.html
[12:02] <eric_hungern> ice799, xdotool
[12:02] <ted___> That works for mounting an encrypted home from a live CD/usb...don't know that anyone needs it...but there it is :)
[12:02] <eric_hungern> but you must know window id
[12:02] <iceroot> eric_hungern: ah ok, i am already using it on the server to automate things, would be great if i can interacte with it from remote, i will have a look at the manpage
[12:03] <iceroot> eric_hungern: ah ok, i want it globaly for the x-server and not for one specific window
[12:03] <ted___> thanks for your help earlier, k1l
[12:03] <eric_hungern> ice799, hmm dig deeper:D
[12:04] <iceroot> eric_hungern: i found a nc-hack to send my keyboard-events to the /dev/foobar on the server...
[12:04] <iceroot> eric_hungern: sounds like what i want but nc is always hard :)
[12:05] <iceroot> eric_hungern: http://superuser.com/questions/67659/linux-share-keyboard-over-network
[12:06] <iceroot> then i would just write a script to execute the second command so that i can enable/disbale it and put it on a hot-key so that i can switch easily my keyboard for local or remote-access
[12:07] <eric_hungern> sounds good
[12:08] <eric_hungern> i wil take note that idea. iceroot maybe oneday i need something like that
[12:08] <iceroot> eric_hungern: ssh would be better (encryption) but i will give the nc-hack a try
[12:08] <eric_hungern> yes ice799 you should try that nhack
[12:09] <iceroot> ah i can great a ssh-tunnel for 4444 and route the nc-traffic through it
[12:09] <iceroot> s/great/create
[12:11] <iceroot> i like how you can do everything with GNU/Linux (when you know how to do it).
[12:12] <iceroot> the only limit is your skill, not the system
[12:12] <eric_hungern> :D
[12:13] <Mensch-Maschine> Hi
[12:20] <MishaX2> Is there anyone who could help me out with testing pgp mail encryption?

[12:29] <bel3atar> Ray: IOS or iOS?
[12:29] <iceroot> Ray: ask #jail #ios or something like that
[12:29] <MishaX2> Could anyone help me with testing my gpg set up?
[12:30] <bel3atar> MishaX2: http://simpleshell.com/
[12:31] <MishaX2> I just want to send an encrypted e-mail to someone else and see if it works, I just needs someones e-mail address + public key right?
[12:31] <MishaX2> and the key I can find on the keyserver
[12:31] <bekks> MishaX2: Yes.
[12:31] <iceroot> MishaX2: yes
[12:32] <dkam> Hi guys - trying to get audio over HDMI working.  VLC doesn't output any sound.  Not really sure where to start - Alsamixer seems to default to "HDA ATI SB" rather than "HDA NVidia".  Will that be related?
[12:32] <MishaX2> Does anyone want to give me their e-mail address, so I can just see how it works and if it works
[12:32] <MishaX2> that'd be great...
[12:32] <bekks> MishaX2: You could send an email to yourself, using your public key.
[12:33] <iceroot> dkam: yes it is related, use F6 in alsamixer to change the outrput
[12:33] <iceroot> dkam: or use "pavucontrol" it should also be able to send data to hdmi
[12:35] <MishaX2> Ok, is it like this? I need someones public key... that person needs my public key. I can send a message to him and enter my private passphrase when sending it. He magically can decrypt it?
[12:35] <dkam> iceroot: Everytime I start alsamixer, it's using HDA ATI SB
[12:35] <MishaX2> He decrypts it with his private key and the message that I sent, was encrypted using my private key and his public key
[12:35] <MishaX2> correct?
[12:35] <cgtdk> MishaX2: I believe so
[12:35] <iceroot> MishaX2: you only need the oub-key of someone and you will encrypt the message with his pup key, we will decrpyt it with his private-key
[12:35] <bekks> MishaX2: You need a public key of someone. The other person just needs his/her secret key.
[12:36] <iceroot> MishaX2: your key is not needed for encryption, its only needed for signing
[12:36] <bekks> MishaX2: And the message you SEND is just encrypted using his/her public key.
[12:36] <iceroot> MishaX2: you only use the key from the other person for encryxption
[12:36] <MishaX2> ah ok
[12:37] <MishaX2> Ok nice, that's pretty neat.
[12:37] <liquid-silence> is it safe to upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10?
[12:37] <MishaX2> Thanks
[12:37] <liquid-silence> or is it better to install 12.10 straight up
[12:37] <liquid-silence> dr_willis: my imac is not seeing the USB disk
[12:37] <iceroot> liquid-silence: its always best to "never touch a running system"
[12:37] <liquid-silence> iceroot: so clean install?
[12:37] <iceroot> liquid-silence: no
[12:38] <liquid-silence> upgrade?
[12:38] <iceroot> liquid-silence: never touch a running systems does not mean delete it, it means use 12.04
[12:38] <liquid-silence> iceroot: why not use 12.10?
[12:38] <iceroot> liquid-silence: but if you need 12.10 for some reasons, the upgrade is fine, no need for reinstall
[12:38] <bekks> liquid-silence: Because it will be supported much longer.
[12:38] <iceroot> liquid-silence: because "never touch a running system" why should you install 12.10 when 12.04 is running fine=

[12:39] <Aleksander> Hello. I'd like my user to have /home/user/Documents linked to ntfs partition with Windows' My Documents, how should I mount it? Make autofs mount it automatically on each startup, or perhaps with fstab?
[12:39] <iceroot> Aleksander: fstab
[12:40] <iceroot> !fstab | Aleksander
[12:40] <ubottu> Aleksander: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions

[13:14] <apos> sure but it wont boot

[13:46] <k1l> !precise
[13:46] <ubottu> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin) is the current !LTS release of Ubuntu.  Download http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.04/ - Release Info: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/1204
[13:46] <dr_willis> the .x releases seem to come about every 6 months dont they
[13:46] <yeats> apg: it's not really a big deal - you just 'apt-get upgrade' (or 'dist-upgrade') and you're there - not like a release to release upgrade
[13:46] <cfhowlett> dr_willis, true.  this point release was delayed ... kernel issues as I understand it.
[13:47] <dr_willis> those pesky pesky kernels
[13:47] <k1l> apg: and the "release" is just a summation of all the updates that came to this date. so i case of a new isntall you dont need to download all updates from 12.04

[13:47] <sgo11> do anyone use gthumb? for catalog, when I delete a image file which has a catalog, I don't find the catalog file gets updated (~/.local/share/gthumb/catalogs/<name>.catalog). That means the catalog file will have a file uri which does not exist. This doesn't seem correct. thanks.
[13:47] <cfhowlett> nuxninja, not true.  official word is NO rolling release plans for the immediate future

[14:18] <delkin_> Hi everyone. When I list my /etc/rc2.d I don't see anything related to X (no gdm nor lightdm). Shoulnd't this folder have all the services that are launched when my linux boots on runlevel 2? I can see with 'runlevel' that I am running on 'N 2'. I was expecting to find a service called something like S90lightdm that I could change to K99lightdm. Can someone give me a hint?

[14:25] <dr_willis> delkin_:  ubuntu uses upstart for most services now.
[14:25] <dr_willis> delkin_:  look in /etc/init/
[14:25] <dr_willis> delkin_:  if you want to boot to text mode. use the text option
[14:25] <dr_willis> !text
[14:25] <ubottu> To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[14:25] <doomlord> hi, what is "Linux"
[14:25] <doomlord> :)
[14:25] <|nv|s|b|e> linux
[14:26] <dr_willis> !linux
[14:26] <ubottu> Linux is the kernel (core) of the Ubuntu operating system. Many operating systems use Linux as a kernel. For more information on Linux in general, visit http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux
[14:26] <doomlord> but wikipedia says "linux" is an OS :) ("for the kernel, see Linux Kernel" ) :)
[14:26] <dr_willis> edit the wiki then.
[14:27] <|nv|s|b|e> lol
[14:27] <|nv|s|b|e> the publically schooled rise again
[14:27] <dr_willis> linux is also a brand laundry soap i recall...
[14:27] <mhs> I am finding record macro in libreoffice
[14:27] <damrock> isnt it possible to compile a kernel module against another kernel?
[14:27] <k1l> doomlord: ask in ##linux if you dont like the wiki page.
[14:27] <|nv|s|b|e> it cleans any traces of windoze
[14:28] <doomlord> we're jus thaving the debate on #programing
[14:28] <doomlord> is it a kernel or an os
[14:28] <dr_willis> the term applys to both
[14:28] <|nv|s|b|e> its an os kernel
[14:28] <k1l> doomlord: that is not a ubuntu support issue :/
[14:28] <doomlord> my point is, it streamlines communication to just call the OS "linux", and "LinuxKernel" can disambiguate
[14:28] <doomlord> (i just thought some here might have na opinion)
[14:29] <delkin_> dr_willis: where should I set the 'text' option?
[14:29] <dr_willis> delkin_:  did you read the info the bot gave? its in /etc/defult/grub
[14:29] <dr_willis> !text
[14:29] <ubottu> To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[14:30] <dr_willis> for perment changes. eidt the file for one time use.. appand it to the grub option via the grub menus
[14:30] <mhs> Hey I am not finding record macro in my libreoffice Version 3.6.2.2. How to get it please.
[14:31] <delkin_> dr_willis: gonna take a look on that. thanks
[14:34] <damrock> why is nobody fixing those kernel module for e1000
[14:34] <damrock> i get mad still those errors in 12.10
[14:34] <k1l> damrock: is there a bug report on launchpad.net?
[14:34] <damrock> yes
[14:34] <damrock> of course it is
[14:35] <damrock> its fixed with the 3.7
[14:35] <damrock> but i can't get my sas controller work with 3.7 because another issue there
[14:35] <damrock> so im damned
[14:35] <damrock> either 3.5 sas works, or 3.7 ethernet works
[14:35] <k1l> damrock: well there are no kernel upgrades for released versions
[14:36] <damrock> what a idiotic crap because the bug is known for 1 year now
[14:36] <apos> then fix it
[14:36] <Colonel> Test
[14:36] <damrock> there is a lot of issues with new ubunut
=== Colonel is now known as Colonel_Panic
[14:37] <tiox> There are always issues with Ubuntu.
[14:37] <damrock> lsd install doesnt' work either with new version of python, because nobody tested if it works
[14:37] <damrock> so they put a new python version and hope everything runs fine
[14:38] <damrock> thats a catastrophic way to make ubuntu popular for peoples
[14:38] <k1l> damrock: this is not a channel for ranting. if there is a bug you know file a bug report on launchpad.net and contribute there
[14:38] <damrock> thank god i use osx on my desktop i don't have the nerves with ubuntu on desk
[14:38] <k1l> *sigh*
[14:38] <Sentynel> hi folks, anybody know if there's anything I can do to stop a pile of apt-check processes being spawned whenever I update apt? I'm running ubuntu server on an ec2 micro instance and don't have the memory or cpu capacity to cope with this, so the whole thing locks up for several minutes every time. there's a bunch of threads/reports about it, but nobody seems to have any actual solutions.
[14:38] <damrock> it doesnt help if you fill a bug report you need to wait forever for the fix
[14:39] <Lucenut> Hey guys, how do you install java for a browser in ubuntu?
[14:39] <damrock> i fix it by myself, compiling the new e1000 drivers and basta
[14:39] <damrock> wait for christmas till it fixed, lol
[14:39] <k1l> damrock: it doesnt help to rant here instead of helping the devs. so i dont see what you want to result in here
[14:40] <damrock> because the raring lsd package is still not fixed, and the bug is knwo for a year
[14:40] <PatchAdams> lucenut, I have used this method many times....http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-oracle-java-7-in-ubuntu-12-04.html
[14:41] <ogra_> damrock, how does ranting in a support channel help with that ?
[14:41] <damrock> ranting?
[14:41] <ogra_> yes
[14:41] <damrock> fill a bug in launchpad sounds so funny
[14:41] <damrock> because it doesnt help
[14:42] <ogra_> but ranting in the wrong place does ?
[14:43] <damrock> you need a boss who coordinate the entire distro, like redhat

[14:46] <delkin_> dr_willis: does it make sense to talk about runlevels since 'upstart' was adopted?
=== altair is now known as Guest19655
[14:48] <dr_willis> !runlevel
[14:48] <ubottu> In Ubuntu all runlevels except 0,1 and 6 are by default equal. Also keep in mind that Ubuntu now uses !Upstart instead of System V init so there is normally no /etc/inittab.
[14:48] <riqdiiz> dr_willis: Hi all how can I get my ideos tether mode  detected by slitaz so I can use it for internet?

[15:01] <devon> Help! I removed Unity to replace it with Cinnamon, and now I've ruined a lot of things! How can I reverse it?
[15:02] <dr_willis> !ppa-purge | devon
[15:02] <ubottu> devon: To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[15:02] <gaussblurinc> dr_willis: yeah, thanks:) i want do the same:) can you advise which one and which tool is best for this?
[15:02] <dr_willis> gaussblurinc: not really. i use them all
[15:02] <devon> dr_willis: couldn't I just use sudo apt-get remove cinnamon?
[15:03] <dr_willis> devon: no idea.. try it and see?
[15:03] <gaussblurinc> dr_willis: maybe tool?
[15:03] <devon> I removed Unity for a reason, it was slow and not to my liking, so I wanted to go to something else, like GNOME
[15:03] <dr_willis> we dont support cinnamon  so no idea what it unstalls
[15:04] <devon> is GNOME still supported or is it just Unity that's supported now?
[15:04] <dr_willis> unity uses gnome 3
[15:04] <k1l> devon: gnome is supported like unity is based on the gnome3 layer
[15:04] <dr_willis> gnome2 us dead
[15:04] <brianmunk> gaussblurinc, try them, Ubuntu One is good for ubuntu, googledrive is not super under linux (I dont think google made a linux app yet (there are 3rd party tools tho), and well dropbox works on every platforme
[15:05] <devon> so how could I remove the Unity parts of GNOME3 and just have a plain GNOME desktop?
[15:05] <k1l> devon: but cinnamon ist not supported. since you need a ppa to install it. for support for cinnamon see the cinnamon community or devs
[15:05] <dr_willis> !classic
[15:05] <ubottu> The default interface in Ubuntu 11.04 is !Unity. To switch back to regular !GNOME: log out, click your username, click the Session box at the bottom of the screen, and select "Ubuntu Classic". For 11.10, see !notunity
[15:05] <devon> !notunity
[15:05] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[15:06] <dr_willis> or just  use lubuntu
[15:06] <devon> I'll have to try this
[15:06] <k1l> devon: you can go with gnome-shell or the gnome-fallback as supported desktops from gnome. but keep in mind that the fallback is not a real gnome2 and misses some features
[15:07] <dr_willis> and fallback is scheduled for removal in the future
[15:07] <k1l> for sticking to the old gnome2 looks i woul recommend to go with xfce or lxde
[15:08] <gaussblurinc> brianmunk: and if i want to backup images? dropbox isn't good solution because of space limit :\
[15:08] <dr_willis> gaussblurinc: buy more?
[15:09] <gaussblurinc> dr_willis: will do
[15:09] <brianmunk> gaussblurinc, I don't think any of them offer alot of space, unless you are paying for amount of storage
[15:10] <gaussblurinc> brianmunk: actually, i want to save images from my phone with android. So, i think, that solution with google drive will be better, but i am not sure
[15:12] <k1l> gaussblurinc: android offers an own storage with google services. so better ask the android support on that
[15:12] <brianmunk> gaussblurinc, I think drive is 5 gb free storage, and yes from android, google drive or dropbox is to be prefered atm imo

[15:16] <devon> but now I still boot to a desktop with 2 icons and that's it
[15:16] <devon> opening a terminal and typing gnome-shell --replace opens the GNOME 3 window manager

[15:17] <Ciphoenix> has anyone tried dual booting with windows 8?
[15:17] <devon> how can I fix this? with the skill I have, I know I shouldn't have touched it, but I couldn't deal with the slowdowns of Unity anymore
[15:17] <larsduesing> Ciphoenix: works. definitely.
[15:17] <Ciphoenix> need to know if there are issues
[15:17] <k1l> devon: which ubuntu are you running? and how did you start that desktop?
[15:18] <PatchAdams> I used to dual-boot...never any issues...no windows anymore!
[15:18] <devon> k1l: I am on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and the desktop started from login, the login stayed as Unity default
[15:18] <dr_willis> devon:  dont use the close button.  do command &    then  the exit command
[15:18] <Ciphoenix> Iarsduesing: thank you :)
[15:18] <k1l> devon: you need to choose you gnome session on the login menue
[15:18] <brianmunk> PatchAdams, 2nd that, no windows anymore
[15:19] <larsduesing> devon: try "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop ubuntu-gnome-default-settings"
[15:19] <devon> oh, alright
[15:19] <k1l> devon: so logout and choose the gnome session. (make sure you installed the gnome-shell metapackage)

[15:54] <badger_> tax-agent, It has worked fine previously. updating killed it.
[15:54] <tax-agent> There you go!!!!!!
[15:55] <tax-agent> dont update.

[15:58] <VlanX> any way to show the size of each sub directory on nautilus?
[15:58] <tax-agent> not really ......what i meant was ubuntu 12.10 is a network troublemaker........used 10.10 11.04 11.10 12.04 none of these had problems ...technically something is wrong with 12.10.........DONT UPDATE ....on  a fresh install just run the command i gave... and that's it.

[16:00] <tax-agent> ^^
[16:00] <badger_> tax-agent, Okay, I will go back to a fresh install on 12.04 is there a tool that I can use to make a live-usb 12.04 to install from ? I have a iso but when i made a live usb on windows with a tool called unetbootin it doesnt install correctly.
[16:01] <k1l> badger_: so you tried the b43 driver or the sta driver mentioned in that wiki page the bot gave you?
[16:01] <keelG> the fact that 12.10 is quite stable aside, I must admit I get another "feel" in 13.04, like we are getting back to some roots - but its only a feeling and I haven't tried it for more than 30mins
[16:01] <_helios_> badger_, if your going to make it from windows use the Universal USB Installer
[16:01] <tax-agent> badger unetbootin is superb..
[16:02] <tax-agent> depends what image you are using
[16:02] <badger_> maybe it is the image that is the problem. i have a live cd of 11.04. but that makes me upgrade to 11.10 so its a very longwinded process to get back to 12.04

[16:04] <islevegan> in the bluetooth tray item i have "plugins" and "local services". there are some options there that create different kind of failures when trying to connect to the bluetooth internet service from the computer.
[16:04] <tax-agent> k1l he has a 'problem' that's why otherwise not
[16:04] <k1l> badger_: so you dont want to investigate what is wrong with your driver and make a new install?
[16:05] <tax-agent> if you dont have already then yes badger_
[16:05] <k1l> tax-agent: there was no information what is the problem actually. and you stating serveral time as a fact, that upgrade dont work, which is not true
[16:06] <badger_> k1l, I don't mind I have a clean install of 12.10 theres nothing on my linux partition i need to keep
[16:06] <k1l> there is no general problem with the upgrades.

[16:09] <ericus> Adeeb, it depends
[16:09] <tax-agent> vipin what card do u have amd or nvidia
[16:10] <vipin> i hav nothing. its a crapy old laptop with just 256 mb ram and no graphic card
[16:10] <ericus> Adeeb, if you're in, let's say /home/user/randomfolder and run that command, everything in randomfolder will be deleted
[16:10] <VlanX> how can i set compression level while zipping a folder???  Can anybody help me out with that?
[16:10] <k1l> vipin: so i dont see a chance to run a dock which need fancy 3d-support to run on that thing
[16:10] <tax-agent> so u mean shared memory.......so then just install xcompmgr from terminal vipin
[16:11] <zykotick9> vipin: from terminal "lspci | grep -i vga" to find your graphics card
[16:11] <zniavre> good afternoon , im tryind to theme a bit unity but im stuck with strange shadow between panel and launcher ( http://i.imgur.com/CxELtD9.png ) any idea how to remove it please ?
[16:11] <ericus> Adeeb, if you're in /, then everything will be deleted. Not recommended
[16:11] <Lapp3n> Hej alla ubuntu kunniga... :)
[16:11] <Adeeb> Are you trying to tell me that if it is ran as "sudo rm -rf *", it will remove everything --- even the OS files provided that the current directory is /?
[16:11] <ericus> hej Lapp3n
[16:12] <Lapp3n> ericus: Detta är inte den svenska delen.. hahha
[16:12] <ericus> I know Lapp3n
[16:13] <ericus> Adeeb, yes, as much as is possible to remove. Bad idea.
[16:14] <Fuzolan> adeeb: it depends on the current directory
[16:14] <ericus> if the cd is /, then it would be a disaster
[16:14] <islevegan> and in bluetooth tray > Plugins > there are many different items, some of which claim a conflict with others and i'm given a choice of either, not both. For example, NMDUNSupport conflicts with PPPSupport and NMINtegration while PPPSupport conflicts with NMIntegration and DhcpClient while PPPSupport conflicts with NMIntegration. I'm not sure which combination is correct.
[16:14] <vipin> tax agent, i did what u said, it now says "GA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
=== tax-agent is now known as asaram-bapu
[16:15] <vipin> yes i did
[16:15] <asaram-bapu> so you installed xcompmgr from terminal vipin??
=== richardb1anson is now known as richardbranson
=== ke5pcv-away is now known as ke5pcv
[16:17] <vipin> yes i did... i installed the docky dock too... it works but has a black rectangle around it... i installed xcompmgr and when i run it, the dock works properly and the rectangle is gone and it works proprly with all effects, but as soon as i close the terminal, it again stops working properly
[16:18] <asaram-bapu> CORRECT!
[16:18] <asaram-bapu> the terminal keeps xcompmgr running as a process thats why!!
[16:18] <vipin> so how can i fix it?
[16:19] <asaram-bapu> vipin just press ALT+F2 and type xcompmgr in the run box........THATS it
[16:20] <vipin> nothing happened
[16:21] <asaram-bapu> then for now just run it from terminal and keep it minimized .....Dont Close it!
[16:21] <vipin> ok
[16:21] <vipin> how can i add xcompmgr to the auto start program list?

[17:02] <spab> Okay.  This sucks.
[17:02] <spab> I'm mounting remote NFS exports from my media server on my local machine
[17:02] <spab> And 2 of 3 will mount with the right user and group
[17:03] <spab> But another refuses to mount locally as anything but nobody:nogroup
[17:03] <spab> Two of the three mounts on the server are physical partitions from /mnt
[17:03] <spab> But one is a directory in a user home directory
[17:04] <spab> Do my UIDs have to be the same on both machines of that user for this to mount right?
[17:05] <malcom2073> Hey, I'm getting an error: "(xfce4-appfinder:31467): xfce4-appfinder-CRITICAL **: Failed to open window: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken."  which causes a 3 second delay whenever I try to launch a particular application, how can I track down what might be causing this?
[17:05] <escott> spab, or you have to map them in your exports
[17:05] <spab> It's mapped in my exports
[17:05] <spab> It mounts
[17:06] <spab> locally that is
[17:06] <spab> But it won't give readwrite access
[17:06] <spab> The other two mounted exports are root:root, but the problem export is nobody:nogroup and I cannot for the life of me figure this out
[17:07] <spab> My /etc/exports lines for all 3 are identical so it *should* work, but doesn't
[17:07] <spab> I mean it mounts, I can df and see it, but can't read/write
[17:09] <spab> And changing the UID/GID prior to mounting has no effect
[17:09] <spab> It just changes back to nobody:nogroup
[17:10] <spab> I have my suspicions that it has something to do with the problem mount being in a user's home directory but Google is being stubborn, or i'm not searching right, so I said "screw this noise; freenode"

[17:14] <waveform> I was here yesterday trying to troubleshoot some odd freezing I'm seeing with 12.0.4
[17:14] <waveform> I was previously running headless and the system just kept freezing for no particular reason and nothing was in the logs
[17:14] <spab> escott, yes
[17:14] <waveform> I hooked up my video card and ran mem test on it... no errors found with memory
[17:15] <waveform> booted into Ubuntu now with video cards hooked up and started down my normal path of getting things up and running and there was a kernel panic
[17:15] <spab> waveform, I have to ask, could this be a temperature issue?
[17:16] <waveform> don't think so spab, nothing has changed and the system has never had similar issues, especially temperature issues
[17:16] <spab> waveform, any recent system updates?
[17:16] <waveform> unless the cpu cooler came unseated or something odd
[17:16] <waveform> yes spab I did do the latest ubuntu system updates
[17:16] <escott> waveform, what was the panic
[17:16] <waveform> hmmm I've got a screenshot of it I took with my phone

[17:19] <thechef> How can I ban the package ttf-corefonts-installer forever from ever being installed again together with other recommends? It's one of the package I do not enjoy at all, because it usually messes up my system with ugly fonts and besides requires accepting an EULA in an otherwise automated installation procedure.

[17:20] <ubottu> [1]lg188: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time.

[17:21] <zykotick9> [1]lg188: check "man aptitude" and read about the -R / --without-recommends option
[17:22] <spab> By giving negative priority for this PIN you will block the installation of the package from any origin

[17:29] <escott> waveform, you have vbox modules loaded. is this the host or the guest
[17:29] <bianca> will that have any negitive effects? or is it just the same?

[17:44] <pooltable> oko
[17:44] <ThinkT510> spab: whats the issue?
[17:45] <spab> ThinkT510, I switched over from samba to nfs to mount from Ubuntu to Ubuntu, and one export mounts as nobody:nogroup and the others are root:root, I can't read/write to my mount
[17:45] <spab> ThinkT510, I can mount the problem NFS export from the server to the local machine, 'df' and see space, but that's all I can do
[17:45] <viderbit> Yo dudes :)
[17:46] <spab> ThinkT510, the two working exports are mounted physical disks on the server in /mnt, but my problem export is a folder in a user home directory
[17:46] <ThinkT510> spab: ah, sorry i'm useless on those issues
[17:46] <spab> ThinkT510, thanks for asking.  Asking is always good.
[17:46] <dr_willis> spab:  i tend to usse sshfs to get to users homes. ;) but it will be slower then nfs i imagine

[17:47] <super-supandi> hello Doctor
=== Neshemah is now known as Catbuntu
[17:47] <spab> dr_willis, I used sshfs for the longest time, then needed to mount from a Windows client and switched to Samba, but that was stuttery and slow for video files,so a few days ago I made the switch to NFS
[17:48] <spab> And on the media disk, it's exponentially faster
[17:48] <pooltable> try easttag thanks for the help
[17:48] <spab> And ditched that Windows machine
[17:48] <dr_willis> ive switched to dlna/ushare/upnp for my media shares.  ;)
[17:48] <pooltable> easy
[17:48] <blbrown_win3> does ubuntu12.10 have built-In twitter support (writing and reading)
[17:48] <zykotick9> spab: fyi, when sharing over NFS - it's UIDs not usernames that are actually used (at least by default).  so if UID 1000 is owner on server, client will map to it's UID 1000 (even if the names are different).  I'm not sure this will help you right now though.
[17:49] <pooltable> does any know a cheap laptop screen repair shop ?
[17:49] <dr_willis> pooltable:  i doubt if such a thing exists as a 'cheap' one.
[17:49] <dr_willis> replacement parts cost as much as a new laptop it seems
[17:49] <spab> zykotick9, HRMMM.  I had my suspicions this could be a UID issue but couldn't find any Google answers
[17:50] <spab> pooltable, you can do it yourself
[17:50] <waveform> escott: I checked my BIOS and am running the latest version I did notice some interesting settings on the RAM voltages etc
[17:50] <spab> pooltable, it's an evening with a few beers but it is very, very simple providing you have an antistatic wrist strap
[17:50] <waveform> set them back to their defaults
[17:50] <waveform> and CPU back to its defaults
[17:50] <waveform> want to make sure it isn't some oddness
[17:50] <pooltable> spab i think i can but not sure where to buy the screen from ?
[17:51] <super-supandi> hallo
[17:51] <spab> pooltable, what make/model laptop?  I have done 3, and bought them from China on eBay with no flaws

[17:52] <sleon_> hello
[17:52] <sleon_> say something
[17:52] <wector> Hello
[17:52] <spab> pooltable, you may have to open the laptop display and get the physical model number off the back of the LCD
[17:52] <sleon_> how are you wector
[17:52] <spab> pooltable, is it a 15.6" LCD?
[17:52] <wector> Sorry
[17:53] <spab> I found one for 59.87 on Amazon
[17:53] <pooltable> send link please?
[17:53] <spab> pooltable, back up -- did you break it, or did it just go dead?
[17:53] <spab> If it went dead, it could be a backlight inverter problem

[18:23] <dbrom> dont want the users to go out side of its home directory
[18:23] <escott> dbrom, then you shouldnt be using scp
[18:23] <spab> kovu, does a USB device show up in your system log when you plug the printer in (assuming it's USB)

I tried to use a live disk to use grub install, and although the commands returned ok, nothing changed. I just can boot Ubuntu  using Super Grub2 Disk. Someone here can help me?
[18:40] <escott> kovu, that file needs to be put somewhere in /usr/share/ppd there should be exact instructions that came with the download
[18:40] <escott> aaamourao, what version of windows?
[18:41] <aaamourao> and I'm sure that I installed GRUN at SDA and not a partition

Please note that some people find it rude to be sent a PM without being asked for permission to do so first.
[18:42] <aaamourao> escott: I use Windows 7
[18:42] <Galaxor> I made a startup usb key
[18:42] <Galaxor> I try to get my bios to boot to it with uefi, and it acts differently than when I boot to the key using regular mode.
[18:42] <kovu> it shows as an usb device unnamed ptinter
[18:42] <escott> aaamourao, paste the output of "sudo parted -l" to paste.ubuntu.com. you might also download and run the boot-info-script from sourceforge
[18:42] <Galaxor> Unfortunately, the main difference is that it just shows a black screen and never boots up.
[18:43] <Galaxor> If I don't boot to the key in uefi mode, the installer won't recognize that uefi is an option.
[18:43] <escott> !nomodeset | Galaxor
[18:43] <ubottu> Galaxor: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[18:44] <Galaxor> escott, thanks, I'll try that.

[18:46] <Galaxor> PhatTony: I like iftop.
[18:46] <PhatTony> Like symantec endpoint protection
[18:46] <yeats> PhatTony: look into wireshark too
[18:46] <PhatTony> iftop
[18:47] <CounterPillow> wireshark is a bit overkill
[18:48] <yeats> CounterPillow: depends on your needs

[18:55] <bekks> netchip: You have to configure the service to bind to that specific servoice.
[18:56] <Galaxor> escott: nomodeset did not help.  Y'know what else is weird is that when I boot using uefi, I don't get the purple screen or the graphical bootup.  I get standard black-and-white grub.  Is that supposed to happen?

[19:07] <dr_willis> if it waswent working.. how did you pair it?
[19:07] <aaamourao> escott: yeah, I think so hahaha Did you recognize some mistake that I committed?
[19:08] <arun> it was working before but not now
[19:10] <escott> aaamourao, so grub_bios is an indication that ubuntu installed grub for a bios boot
[19:10] <escott> aaamourao, i would figure out how the system is currently booting windows. presumably it is efi mode in which case you need to install grub-efi
[19:11] <aaamourao> ok
[19:11] <aaamourao> escott: ok, should I "sudo apt-get install grub-efi"?
[19:12] <escott> aaamourao, within a chroot sure
[19:12] <aaamourao> okey, scott.. I install it and run "grub-efi"?
[19:12] <arun> hey
[19:12] <arun> will
[19:12] <aaamourao> escott:  okey, scott.. I install it and run "grub-efi"? after change root, of course
[19:13] <mojtaba> Hi
[19:14] <arun> help me
[19:14] <arun> hey Mr. Will
[19:14] <mojtaba> Could you please let me know what is the equivalent download manager in ubuntu?

[19:15] <craigbass1976> I've got 12.04 on /dev/sda2, and 12.10 /dev/sdd5  but grub won't recognize the 12.10 install. I haven't had to mess with grub since I could directly edit menu.lst or grub.conf.  What's the best way to make grub see the install.
[19:15] <DJones> tanveer: Yes it is the ubuntu support channel
[19:15] <mojtaba> bekks: download manager
[19:15] <tanveer> DJones:  HI I want to Install Teamviewer but its not working
[19:15] <bekks> mojtaba: You have to install one, if you need one.
[19:15] <tanveer> DJones:  i just installed fresh Ubuntu 12.10
[19:15] <tanveer> DJones:  and i also have no sound
[19:15] <mojtaba> bekks: Do you know which one is better?
[19:16] <bekks> !best | mojtaba
[19:16] <ubottu> mojtaba: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[19:16] <tanveer> I also couldnt get chrome to work so i installed chromium
[19:16] <minoo> hi
[19:16] <mojtaba> !best | mojtaba
[19:16] <ubottu> mojtaba, please see my private message
[19:16] <DJones> tanveer: Just ask the channel in general, for the sound issue, you'll need to give details of your sound hardware, what you've done to try getting it working, and what actually happens

[19:34] <l057c0d3r> hello peeps...
[19:35] <yakirice> j32a32: http://askubuntu.com/questions/190489/touchpad-not-working-in-ubuntu-12-04
[19:35] <l057c0d3r> was hoping i could get some help really fast... i didn't set up auto login when i installed ubuntu...  so i went into /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and added autologin-user="My user name" and autologin-user-timeout=5 so it would log me in after 5 seconds if another user was not selected
[19:35] <lucis> j332a32 what i can find is that when you type FN+F7 at the login screen, the touchpad works. the rest is up to you if this is the case.
[19:36] <l057c0d3r> however after 5 seconds instead of login me in..  the password box vanishes and it sais.. failed to authenticate..   where did i go wrong
[19:36] <j32a32> ubuntu recognizes the touch pad as Enabled but it does not work.
[19:36] <yakirice> oh :/
[19:37] <SolarisBoy> is there a specific package to install to avoid these messages "locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory" on actions like apt-get installs etc. - it's a debootstrapped ubuntu 12.04.1 precise system
[19:38] <lucis> j32a32 they have mentioned that is indeed so, but it states that in the login screen the fn+f7 should do the trick.  perhaps synclient TouchPadOff=0
[19:38] <yakirice> yeah i just saw that also lucis
[19:38] <j32a32> ok thanks lucis

[19:43] <herpherp> Hello, someone pretty please take alook at my xorg.conf i cant get nvidia-settings to play nice: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1577719/
[19:43] <cire> cifs-utils was the right packagfe
[19:43] <os__konversation> ActionParsnip: i check the offical site
[19:44] <os__konversation> it has a driver for ubuntu 10.04
[19:44] <l057c0d3r> any idea why i get failed to authenticate on login using autoloign?  added autologin-user=USERNAME to /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
[19:44] <herpherp> os__konversation: was that for me?
[19:44] <os__konversation> herpherp: no :) sorry
[19:44] <herpherp> oh hehe np np :)
[19:45] <IdleOne> l057c0d3r: I am thinking there is something you need to edit in /etc/pam.d/lightdm but I am not sure what
[19:45] <schallusion> ActionParsnip, lucis: i will try
[19:45] <l057c0d3r> IdleOne, i'll check it out...
[19:45] <ActionParsnip> Os_konversation: yes, does the driver work?
[19:45] <os__konversation> ActionParsnip: i didn't try it actually .. :)
[19:46] <ActionParsnip> Os_konversation: it doesn't say its for Lucid,  just says Ubuntu and Debian

[19:49] <bekks> netchip: You can do it entirely in Ubuntu - every service you runn is a part of Ubuntu.
[19:49] <schallusion> ActionParsnip: this seems a hit
[19:50] <ActionParsnip> Os_konversation: says ubuntu and Debian .....

[19:50] <lucis> schallusion, what does ifconfig tell you?
[19:50] <l057c0d3r> k well i think i got it now.. going to see if it worked
[19:50] <netchip> bekks, I mean, configure Ubuntu to let that service run on that IP ;)
[19:50] <l057c0d3r> thanks for pointing me in a good direction IdleOne
[19:51] <schallusion> lucis: ifconfig tells me the interface is up, iwconfig tells me it is connected, the log tries DHCPDISCOVER, but fails
[19:51] <IdleOne> l057c0d3r: hope you sort it out.
[19:51] <bekks> netchip: Yes, you have to configure the service to do so. By default, a service runs on all available interfaces.
[19:51] <bekks> netchip: There is no magic button that does your job. :)

[20:05] <DarkSim> On Ubuntu 12.04 how do I look how much space there is left on a drive?
[20:05] <ActionParsnip> Dmnchild: does the repo support Quantal?
[20:05] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: df -h
[20:06] <Dmnchild> ActionParsnip: I think its accessing the repo, per instructions it let me add, update etc. then I get 3 similar errors for different versions when it tries to install
[20:06] <Dmnchild> W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/freenx-team/ppa/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/binary-amd64/Packages  404  Not Found
[20:06] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: partitions have space, not the drive.  Even if the partition is 100% of the drive, it's still the partition
[20:07] <Dmnchild> and so forth for different cpu
[20:07] <DarkSim> ActionParsnip, I have a extra 100gb ext4 partition which I was supposed to store things on but everything happens to stay on the OS partition
[20:07] <ActionParsnip> Dmnchild: http://ppa.launchpad.net/freenx-team/ppa/ubuntu/dists/
[20:09] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: you can mount the other partition as a folder and use it that way.
[20:09] <ActionParsnip> Dmnchild: can you see why its not found :-)
[20:09] <DarkSim> Yeah I guess, it just that everything I install manually gets installed on the OS Drive anyway
[20:09] <DarkSim> So I guess it's less important to have seperate drives in Linux than it is on Windows
[20:10] <DarkSim> partitions*
[20:10] <lucis> schallusion can you ping the modem? if you cannot it is normal you get no ip.
[20:10] <Dmnchild> Bah so time to downgrade then eh
[20:10] <Frank604> Darksim: or you can simlink the drive
[20:11] <Dmnchild> I only have remote access to this computer so needs to support remote login (less i decide to only command prompt, but i am not on that level yet ;p)
[20:11] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: it can be advantageous,  separate /home is good, some people like to have other parts of the filesystem on its own partitions
[20:11] <codepython777> I've a remote ubuntu box with 10GB hard drive space (only ssh access with root). How can I backup the hard drive so that I can build a machine locally with 10GB hard drive that is a mirror of the remote box.
[20:11] <ActionParsnip> Dmnchild: what are you intending to use freenx to achieve?
[20:11] <DarkSim> Oh ok, still learning Linux (for almost 1 year now)
[20:12] <Dmnchild> GUI remote login using the Nomachine Player
[20:12] <DarkSim> but I guess I'll just wipe it all if it doesn't feel good
[20:12] <DarkSim> it's only 130gb
[20:12] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: yes but to do what on the remote system?

[20:12] <DarkSim> Sorry, you lost me

[20:13] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: obviously its remote access, that is what freenx is for
[20:13] <bekks> codepython777: Most likely, there is a reason why it was mounted readonly.
[20:13] <codepython777> bekks: why did this happen?
[20:13] <DarkSim> ActionParsnip, you are talking to the wrong guy
[20:13] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: what activities will you be doing on the remote system
[20:13] <bekks> codepython777: You have to find it out, e.g. using dmesg
[20:13] <codepython777> bekks: how can we find out whats the problem?
[20:13] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: doh
[20:14] <ActionParsnip> Dmnchild: what are you going to do on the remote system
[20:14] <Bruse_> Hello folks
[20:14] <DarkSim> ActionParsnip, I have free 104gb drive space, how can I use that to expand the OS partition?

[20:15] <Dmnchild> stuff I could do via command prompt only, but still would like the remote login.
[20:15] <bekks> codepython777: Then it might have run out of the ring buffer of dmesg already.
[20:15] <ActionParsnip> Darksim: you could mount it  as a folder and use it as data storage
[20:15] <Bruse_> When I try to boot from the DVD I keep getting stuck with a black screen and a blinking underscore

[20:22] <raven> i dont know really what happend but my parents took the usb cable out from the computer when it was off and i was not home.. anyways trying to mount it via ubuntu but fdisk -l and lsusb -vv does not show the disk at all (its an external drive with separate power supply)
[20:22] <ActionParsnip> Ntalasha: not seeing anything in my chat log
[20:22] <raven> anyone knows what the reason could be ?
[20:23] <ActionParsnip> Raven: try in ##hardware
[20:23] <Bruse_> ActionParsnip ubottu Ok, thanks for pointing me in the right direction.
[20:23] <bekks> raven: Broken harddisk, broken USB case, broken power supply.
[20:23] <raven> bekks i tried to change usb cable still the same
[20:23] <codepython777> bekks: if its read only, is there a way to create a backup of that drive so that i can try to boot from that drive?

[21:33] <cristian_c> yeats, Ctrl+F opens xterm
[21:34] <markprime> having trouble making binwalk on 11.10 just wondered if anyone was familiar with it, any suggestions
[21:34] <TheLordOfTime> cristian_c, then you're doing it wrong - ctrl+f is the keyboard shortcut for find in chromium
[21:34] <yeats> cristian_c: wait - I'm not sure I understand - you want to invoke the Find box in Chromium from the command lin?
[21:34] <TheLordOfTime> if something's intercepting that and running xterm instead...

[21:37] <ThinkT510> cristian_c: why do you want to do that?
[21:37] <TheLordOfTime> cristian_c, whcih means something somewhere has ctrl+f as a keyboard shortcut to open xterm, and is overruling chromium's shortcut
[21:37] <TheLordOfTime> cristian_c, you need to figure out what and disable that
[21:37]  * TheLordOfTime uses ttys for terminal, so he can't help much.
[21:37] <cristian_c> TheLordOfTime, maybe :)
[21:37] <_helios_> TheLordOfTime, uses the 133t ctrl-alt-f1 f2 f3 etc... lol
[21:38] <jasunto> guessed around and found uncommenting # provides UDP syslog reception $ModLoad imudp $UDPServerRun 514 works for udp
[21:38] <TheLordOfTime> cristian_c, no "maybe" there, that's a definite cause of such a problem.
[21:38] <TheLordOfTime> cristian_c, in all the ubuntu releases, ctrl +f is NOT a shortcut to open xterm.
[21:38] <TheLordOfTime> by default at least

[21:42] <ClientAlive> jrib: helio: what about something more, errr... automated than searching for every package I don't want on there? Is it conceivable I could run << aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages  >> on the newly installed o/s on the lappy, diff the two files (the lappy one and the desktop machine one). Then review and edit that diffed file. When satisfied, is there a way to feed that fill in for the purpose

[21:52] <_helios_> orionar, ls
[21:53] <ClientAlive> jrib: yes. I want an (almost) exact duplicate of the desktop machine on the lappy with these importand differences - (not appache2), not gnome 3 but rather unity (ubuntu's desktop release).. AND eclipse will be installed sparately.
[21:53] <_helios_> orionar, LS lower case
[21:53] <orionar> ok thank you, ill try
[21:53] <ClientAlive> ActionParsnip: I don't know what seconds means
[21:53] <_helios_> orionar, remember that the filesystem is CASE SENSATIVE
[21:53] <ClientAlive> not in the context I see you use it anyway
[21:53] <jrib> ClientAlive: why are there two machines now?  You're cloning the package installation from one machine to another and want to modify it?
[21:54] <_helios_> orionar, so if a folder says MyStuff make sure you type it cd MyStuff

[21:57] <arun> thanks
[21:57] <ClientAlive> jrib: So the idea I thought may work is to (1) isolate the packages that get installed on the lappy wich are not found on the desktop machine. (2) feed that list into aptitude for removal as apposed to installation.
[21:57] <ActionParsnip> Chuckqt: what video chip do you use?
[21:57] <Chuckqt> nvida gts
[21:57] <Chuckqt> 450
[21:57] <jrib> ClientAlive: then you can either create another aptitude command that searches for uninstalled packages or just use dpkg --get-selections (with dpkg --get-selections though you lose the fact that with the aptitude command you didn't end up with dependencies as manually installed packages)
[21:58] <ActionParsnip> Chuckqt: did you install nvidia-current package?
[21:58] <ClientAlive> jrib: I wondered if diffing the list of installed packages that cones from the desktop machine with the list that comes from the lappy would genarate that.
[21:58] <jrib> ClientAlive: sure, you can do what you suggest too.  Just run the aptitude command on your laptop and then find the difference in the file (man comm)
[21:59] <Chuckqt> yea, I did on my last reinstall and I did updates thru software updater and on the reboot all I see is a blank screen
[21:59] <ClientAlive> jrib: ok, but the problem is I have never used diff (at least not successfully) and I don't know commands to do these actions.
[21:59] <ClientAlive> :)
[21:59] <jrib> ClientAlive: I suggest you use comm for this, not diff
[21:59] <ClientAlive> ok
[22:00] <ActionParsnip> Chuckqt: install xfce4 too, it doesn't need compositing to run. It'll give a usable desktop
[22:00] <heywood> what's the name of the control panel executable where you can set the power settings (screensaver lock timeout, etc.)?
[22:00] <ActionParsnip> Chuckqt: is the system a laptop?
[22:00] <ClientAlive> jrib: thx for your help sir. Do I now need to study how to use this package (comm) so that I'll have the command I need to run?
[22:00] <Chuckqt> no it's a desktop I built several years ago

[22:04] <minoo> zygoptera: i have 32 bit binary here, its a upstream closed source thingy. I already builded a amd64 package with it, but dh_shlibdeps is not setting the correct dependencies
[22:04] <Chuckqt> gts450
[22:05] <ActionParsnip> Chuckqt: if your monitor isn't playing right,  you can use an xorg.conf file to make it work. You will have problems if you use an Intel CPU with Ivy/Sandybridge
[22:05] <Chuckqt> I've installed the os as a 32bit and 64bit I was able to get a running system when I installed 12.4  32 bit but had to mess around and upgrade to the 64 bit
[22:05] <minoo> zygoptera: i already figured out all the 32bit packages which are needed for it, i just cant find a tutorial for building packages which are :i386
[22:06] <Chuckqt> some times I wish I could just leave thing alone
[22:06] <zygoptera> minoo >> isn't it a gcc option for which platform you are compiling for?
[22:08] <jeeves_moss> how can I recover the pictures from an SD card?  I've tried to use testdisk, and it can't see the partition
[22:08] <Chuckqt> well, thanks for the suggestions, I'm all set to complete a reinstall, so wish me luck
[22:08] <minoo> zygoptera: i'm not compiling at all, its already compiled bin
[22:09] <BluesKaj> Chuckqt, you may need the swatx ppa for the correct driver for the gts450,  http://howtofindsolution.blogspot.ca/2012/10/install-and-configure-latest-nvidia.html
=== andrejpan1 is now known as andrejpan
[22:10] <BluesKaj> oops, too late
[22:10] <dr_willis> jeeves_moss:  you could try ddrescue to image the card to a file. then try to recover from the file with various tools also.
[22:12] <Justice> so is there a reason unity runs like crap when i disable desktop icons in dconf-editor ?
[22:12] <ActionParsnip> Jeeves_moss: try foremost. Your backups will be a far better method
[22:12] <erupter> I've got reading a bit on launchpad, but I'm still fuzzy over what are the needed steps to create a ppa. what else can I read to get a clear picture on what goes where?

[22:30] <dr_willis> danlamanna:  those only get used by the login shell  i belive.
[22:31] <dr_willis> or was i thinking of another file. ;() i get confused ;)
[22:31] <dr_willis> if your initial login did some cd /  - then it may be the root cause.

[22:41] <genoobie> I just installed xubuntu and I am trying to use additional drivers to install the wireless card
[22:42] <genoobie> but it says "downloading and installing driver" for like 10 minutes now
[22:42] <genoobie> how can I tell if it is doing anything
[22:44] <genoobie> any tips?
[22:45] <genoobie> there used to be a lot of traffic on this channel...
[22:46] <drag0nius> what is some GPU confirmed working with multiple monitors under ~170 euros?
[22:46] <daftykins> genoobie: if by traffic you mean peeps demanding help, it comes and goes :>

[22:46] <sleekm> hi. i installed ubuntu net install and I do not have gdm or lightdm etc. when the computer boots i have to type startx everytime. how can i get it to automatically log me in this way without having to download a login manager. it is only a single user laptop
[22:46] <sleekm> ?
[22:47] <drag0nius> 2 is good, 3 would be best (in future)

[22:48] <drag0nius> main screen is working pretty good
[22:48] <drag0nius> but its even hard to describe what happens to second ;d
[22:48] <genoobie> anyhow, I'm not sure how to tell if a tool is running or it's "hung"
[22:48] <drag0nius> sometimes its all grey, sometimes all white, sometimes both go off
[22:49] <daftykins> genoobie: use the system monitor to see if the processor load is high

[22:49] <genoobie> ok
[22:49] <drag0nius> its common problem with my gpu model
[22:50] <genoobie> daftykins, does not appear to be high.  Task manager is the highest usage
[22:50] <genoobie> however, jockey-gtk is using 1-3%

[22:58] <sleekm> ok i will open the file and check out
[23:00] <sleekm> usr13:
[23:00] <sleekm> usr13: this is how the autostart is
[23:00] <sleekm> @lxpanel --profile LXDE @pcmanfm --desktop --profile LXDE @/usr/lib/policykit-1-gnome/polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1
[23:01] <genoobie> ugh
[23:01] <sleekm> what should i add to auto login to x then without having to login to the black screen prompt first
[23:01] <genoobie> I am pretty sure this thing is "hung" or "hanged"
[23:02] <genoobie> hey all
[23:02] <sleekm> another issue i have is that i need to know what is needed from synaptic for the gnome keyring. i can start synaptic from terminal with password but the gui will not take the password
[23:02] <sleekm> sup genoobie
[23:02] <genoobie> new to this thing, and coming from a winxp world
[23:02] <genoobie> 120 processes seems like a lot
[23:03] <sleekm> genoobie: xp ran more u couldnt see
[23:03] <genoobie> I am running xubuntu which is purported to be fast
[23:03] <genoobie> but it is dragging and hanging
[23:03] <genoobie> not sure why though...
[23:03] <sleekm> genoobie: lubuntu is quicker if u want minimal approach
[23:03] <genoobie> yeah, I use lubuntu on another laptop and it seems ok
[23:03] <genoobie> I mean I like it because it is pretty fast
[23:03] <usr13> sleekm: A file with something like Exec=/usr/bin/startx in it.
[23:04] <genoobie> should I just install lubuntu or try and slim down xubuntu
[23:04] <usr13> sleekm: or Exec=/usr/bin/startxfce4
[23:04] <usr13> sleekm: or Exec=/usr/bin/startlxde
[23:05] <usr13> sleekm: In other words, cut to the chase and start the DE

[23:14] <fadax> hi
[23:15] <saltmiser> yo
[23:16] <fadax> how do i figure out what packages to install with apt-get, for example if I know I need the c++ library xmlrpc_client how can I find out what package that's in?
[23:16] <saltmiser> packages.ubuntu.org I believe you can browse
[23:16] <saltmiser> unless you want to know the exact apt-get/dpkg command to tell you, that I don't know
[23:18] <sect0r> Hello, I am new to linux/ubuntu.  I installed 12.10, updated it, installed some apps from the sofware center, and rebooted.  Now after I login nothing happens, all I see is the desktop wallpaper and my resolution changed.  Can someone help me?
[23:19] <fadax> ok thanks saltmiser i'll try that
[23:19] <saltmiser> fadax, it used to be packages.debian.org
[23:19] <saltmiser> back in the dizz-ay
[23:19] <saltmiser> sect0r, can you login with any other window manager
[23:20] <saltmiser> sup SolarisBoy
[23:20] <SolarisBoy> hi
[23:20] <saltmiser> do you use Solaris
[23:20] <SolarisBoy> sure
[23:20] <saltmiser> more than Ubuntu
[23:20] <saltmiser> ?
[23:20] <escott> fadax, apt-file can help you find individual files in packages
[23:21] <SolarisBoy> i guess i use ubuntu more often as i use it for a desktop
[23:22] <sect0r> saltmiser; how do i try that
[23:22] <saltmiser> do you ever see the login screen
[23:22] <saltmiser> where you have to login
[23:22] <sect0r> saltmiser; i can bring up a terminal with ctrl+alt+t
[23:23] <sect0r> yes
[23:23] <saltmiser> you have a terminal?
[23:23] <saltmiser> oh that's good
[23:23] <Joe> Hello, I have never used an operating system on a PC other than Windows. I am interested in using Ubunutu on an older computer however I have some questions before I procede
[23:23] <saltmiser> Joe, don't use Ubuntu use Xubuntu or Lubuntu
[23:24] <Joe> I read that Xubuntu and Lubuntu are more fit for computers with outdated hardware?
[23:24] <saltmiser> you read correct!
[23:24] <saltmiser> Lubuntu would be anything pre like 1998
[23:24] <saltmiser> 2000, or so
[23:25] <Joe> When would Xubuntu be? Because mine was probably around 2003
[23:25] <saltmiser> What are the specs?
[23:25] <saltmiser> Ubuntu runs nice if the 3D is supported out of the box
[23:25] <saltmiser> I use Xubuntu on my laptop I bought 2 years ago from walmart
[23:25] <saltmiser> dual-core 1 GHz CPU with 8GB DDR3 1066 RAM
[23:26] <saltmiser> Joe, depending on the specs, you should use Xubuntu
[23:26] <skp1> xfce4 is highlt customizable.
[23:27] <skp1> highly.
[23:27] <sect0r> saltmiser: could it be because I changed the video driver?
[23:27] <zygoptera> saltmiser >> a large percentage of the problem asked about here on the average day revolve are unity. Maybe xubuntu is a better solution for even newer computers?
[23:27] <escott> Joe, you could also try ubuntu in a virtual machine on modern hardware. ie download and install virtualbox on your windows system
[23:28] <saltmiser> zygoptera, considering I used unity once for about 5 minutes before I gave up, yes, I agree
[23:28] <saltmiser> escott, I agree
[23:28] <saltmiser> sect0r, that probably has a lot to do with it
[23:28] <Amphibulus> I have tested unity in the past and I did not like it, but since 12.04 I run unity
[23:28] <Joe> I believe it is a Dell Dimension 4600 which would leave it with Intel Pentium 4 2.8 GHz processor, 512 mb RAM and I'm not sure what other information is necessarry
[23:28] <Amphibulus> and I like it :S
[23:28] <saltmiser> sect0r, what is your video situation?
[23:29] <escott> Joe, and doing so would be both easier to use and a fairer comparison because you will be able to give substantially more resources to the virtual machine than your 2003 laptop
[23:29] <saltmiser> Amphibulus, if I had a touch screen I think unity would be nice.  If unity is what ubuntu is trying to sennd to the smartphones, that would be cool
[23:29] <sect0r> is there a way I can bring up ubuntu system settings from terminal?
[23:29] <saltmiser> sect0r, the terminal is the system settings ;P
[23:29] <saltmiser> I'm not sure what to tell you
[23:29] <saltmiser> do you know how to edit text files
[23:29] <saltmiser> ?
[23:29] <saltmiser> with nano
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[23:29] <Amphibulus> saltmiser, I don't have a touch screen, but I don't know what people don't like about it
[23:30] <daftykins> sect0r: what do you want to change?
[23:30] <zygoptera> Joe >> if all your components are linux compatible, that should be sufficient
[23:30] <chuckly> I having trouble installing ubuntu on my motherboard z77 gigabyte
[23:30] <saltmiser> daftykins, he messed up his video, I was going to have him boot X with the vesa driver to get him going
[23:30] <Joe> I am limited with Linux information, how can I learn if my components are compatible?
[23:30] <daftykins> saltmiser: ah ok, sorry didn't realise you were already on that one
[23:30] <sect0r> daftykins: the graphics driver it uses
[23:31] <Amphibulus> Joe buy parts, and if it doesn't work put them in the trash, then repeat
[23:31] <escott> Joe, thats what the install cd/livecd is for
[23:31] <chuckly> I have create a usb stick and only get so far with the initial boot and then stops
[23:31] <saltmiser> Joe, most are. Boot up the live cd and see what happens
[23:31] <Amphibulus> that's what I have done, but now I'm happy with my setup
[23:31] <saltmiser> chuckly, what you mean it stops
[23:31] <daftykins> Joe: there are hardware compatibility lists online
[23:32] <the_mix> chuckly, use universal usb installer
[23:32] <zygoptera> Joe >> a xubuntu live cd is the final way to know.
[23:32] <the_mix> to make it bootable
[23:32] <Joe> Live CD from Ubunutu? I have not purchased anything yet, I have just been looking around when I found an old tower in my basement with a very limited hard drive
[23:32] <Amphibulus> chuckly, I have a z77a msi and it works
[23:32] <saltmiser> Joe you don't purchase anything
[23:33] <chuckly> saltmiser: 12.04.1 64bit uefi I get stripes on the screen after the first boot
[23:33] <escott> !nomodeset | chuckly
[23:33] <ubottu> chuckly: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[23:33] <Joe> So for a live cd I jsut download the Xubutnu iso image and burn it to a cd?
[23:33] <saltmiser> joe, yes
[23:33] <saltmiser> just like if you were illegally burning a windows cd
[23:34] <saltmiser> same exact procedure
[23:34] <Amphibulus> there is some system that I was unable to install with 12.04.1 but I have able with 12.04... maybe you can give it a try
[23:34] <chuckly> saltmiser: should I boot into uefi or not with 12.04.1
[23:34] <SnapSnap> When I try to perform a backup, I get the following error: "BackendException: Could not initialize backend: No module named couch.auth"
[23:34] <Joe> okay and I am able to do this using a bootable flash drive as well?
[23:34] <saltmiser> chuckly, I don't know what UEFI is unfortunately. I'm just a programmer
[23:34] <zygoptera> Joe >>  yes
[23:34] <saltmiser> Joe indeed you can
[23:35] <Joe> Okay thank you. So Ubuntu is not suggested for my Dimension 4600? Which is more preferred, Xubuntu or Lubuntu?
[23:35] <saltmiser> joe I believe there are decent instructions on the ubuntu website for how to burn an ISO image to a flash drive, the xubuntu procedure would bet he same
[23:35] <chuckly> I will try to boot with nomodeset
[23:35] <OerHeks> !uefi
[23:35] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[23:35] <zygoptera> Xubuntu should be fine
[23:35] <saltmiser> Joe Xubuntu would be preferred.  Lubuntu is for extremely limited computers, i'm talking like Pentium 3's and earlier
[23:35] <chuckly> how do I do this with the live usb
[23:35] <saltmiser> I use XFCE on a 500mhz pentium3 anyway
[23:35] <Amphibulus> saltmiser, do you run 12.04 or 12.10?
[23:36] <saltmiser> so really like pentium 2's and other obscure hardware
[23:36] <saltmiser> cat: /etc/ubuntu-version: No such file or directory
[23:36] <Joe> Okay thank you. What is really the difference between Xubuntu and Ubuntu?
[23:36] <danman1453> just upgraded to 12.04 from 11.10, the gui shows the desktop background, then backs out to a terminal looking screen with no prompt. Just something about mount then unmounting the network filesystems.
[23:36] <escott> Joe, the gui is different
[23:36] <Amphibulus> Joe, X interface
[23:36] <zygoptera> Joe >> it should probably run xubuntu faster than it ran windows
[23:36] <saltmiser> Joe Xubuntu uses a 2D desktop environment like Windows XP and 2000
[23:36] <OerHeks> xubuntu 512 mb, ubuntu 1 gb
[23:37] <saltmiser> Joe Ubuntu uses a 3D environment like windows aero, etc.
[23:37] <lazer> Joe: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment (See Unity and Xfce)
[23:37] <danman1453> i can ctl-alt-f1 into tty1 and start startx no problem. but my usb hd isnt mounted. my other local shares are fine.
[23:37] <Amphibulus> So I guess I'm the only one who like Unity
[23:37] <OerHeks> Lubuntu 256 mb
[23:37] <Joe> Okay, will it require the same or possibly less hard drive space than windows? Because I had to use a small hard drive I had laying aroudn to reinstall Windows as my old one stopped functioning
[23:37] <saltmiser> Joe WAy less space
[23:37] <C4zz1dy> Isn't Unity a game engine? ;P
[23:37] <saltmiser> Joe if you have like 4GB that's fine
[23:38] <Joe> Okay thank you very much, I will try to install Xubuntu when I've some spare time. For now I will attempt to learn teh basics of this operating system. Thanks!
[23:38] <saltmiser> Amphibulus, I've been using KDE and XFCE for so long that I just can't adjust to Unity.  I miss GNOME
[23:38] <Amphibulus> Well, it runs nicely here, really fast
[23:38] <escott> C4zz1dy, there is a game named unity as well
[23:38] <danman1453> every time i have upgraded to the latest release, the boot broke. i am going to stop upgrading.
[23:38] <C4zz1dy> seriously?
[23:38] <C4zz1dy> to the googles. brb
[23:38] <zygoptera> Joe >> if you want to get general use from it, I would recommend at least 18gb
[23:38] <escott> C4zz1dy, there is also a game named chromium and it came first so installing chromium is usually not what people want when they want the browser
[23:38] <chuckly> ubottu: the page indicates I need 12.10, so I will do boot without uefi, if I can only work out how to do it
[23:38] <ubottu> chuckly: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[23:39] <sect0r> saltmiser: yes, I know how to use pico, what file contains the gpu driver information I'm looking for?
[23:39] <saltmiser> Joe, I can tell you the basics in a sentence.  Linux does everything from the command line, aka a terminal.  Learn to use the terminal, and you'll know how to control everything.
[23:39] <escott> chuckly, you can boot efi in 12.04
[23:39] <lazer> (And there are unity linux! I googled!)
[23:39] <saltmiser> sect0r, I was thinking /etc/X11/xorg.conf, that is where X stores it's configuration.  If it is an empty file that means X is autoconfiguring it's self when you start it
[23:39] <SnapSnap> When I try to perform a backup, I get the following error: "BackendException: Could not initialize backend: No module named couch.auth"
[23:39] <sect0r> i checked that, it's empty
[23:39] <Joe> Do you have any advice on where I can learn to sue a terminal?
[23:40] <C4zz1dy> well I know of Chromium..
[23:40] <saltmiser> sect0r, if you can manage to get the X server shut down, some commands you could play with as root include `X -configure` and `X -config /root/my_test_xorg.conf`
[23:40] <Joe> **use
[23:40] <Amphibulus> saltmiser, I just pin the software that I use on the bar, then I search for those that I need, not sure sure what is missing
[23:40] <C4zz1dy> Some galactica looking thing
[23:40] <chuckly> do some more reading then, thanks for your help and patienc
[23:40] <lazer> Joe: Just keep using it and you'll learn that way.
[23:40] <saltmiser> `X -configure` will make an xorg.conf.new file based on the configuration it finds
[23:40] <C4zz1dy> Joe, start by registering on the Ubuntu forums :)
[23:40] <skp1> unity is awesome.
[23:40] <OerHeks> Joe, good start > https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
[23:40] <saltmiser> when the system boots, X will use /etc/X11/xorg.conf as it's graphics configuration
[23:41] <saltmiser> here you can set up custom resolutions, etc.
[23:41] <Joe> Okay I will give it a shot. Terminal is for Xubuntu as DOS is for Windows?
[23:41] <Amphibulus> skp1, :)
[23:41] <C4zz1dy> The community and help articles are pretty good
[23:41] <saltmiser> but sect0r, if you change the video driver to "vesa" the X server should start.
[23:41] <C4zz1dy> It's a sexier version of CMD
[23:41] <C4zz1dy> lol
[23:41] <saltmiser> sect0r, if you could give me more details on what sort of GPU you're working with I could help more
[23:41] <Joe> Alright haha thanks!
[23:41] <saltmiser> I've delt with both nvidia and ati
[23:42] <saltmiser> Joe, don't forget that Ubuntu isn't the only distro in the world
[23:42] <saltmiser> Joe, OpenSUSE is another nice one
[23:42] <saltmiser> you might like Kubuntu if you're not underestimating your laptop's capabilities
[23:42] <C4zz1dy> Kubuntu too
[23:42] <sect0r> saltmiser, thanks for your help, i fixed it. ran software-properties-gtk from the terminal window I got to open and switched it back to the old driver.
[23:42] <C4zz1dy> and Mint..though Ubuntu still my fave.
[23:42] <saltmiser> sect0r sweet. I don't actually use ubuntu, I use gentoo :P
[23:43] <zygoptera> saltmiser >> dell dimension 4600 specs here ... http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/systems/dim4600/en/4600/sm/specs.htm
[23:43] <Joe> Do you prefer one over the other for lightness? I am looking for a quick Operating System that will run smoothly
[23:43] <saltmiser> my "work laptop" runs ubuntu and I use ubuntu server a lot so, figured I'd hang out here
[23:43] <saltmiser> runs xubuntu, that is ;D
[23:43] <saltmiser> Joe xubuntu will run pretty quick
[23:43] <aeon-ltd> Joe: got time? arch or ubuntu server. start from scratch just install the stuff you need
[23:44] <saltmiser> you can have gentoo compile every source file specifically for your computer's processor
[23:44] <aeon-ltd> Joe: you can't get leaner than that without recompiling every package
[23:44] <saltmiser> pretty much
[23:44] <saltmiser> arch always seemed really snappy for 32 bit machiens
[23:44] <saltmiser> since xubuntu compiles for 386 still
[23:44] <Joe> I am not sure how I would install the stuff I need. I have never used an operating system on my desktop computer other than Windows so I am looking for a Linux operating system to learn on
[23:44] <saltmiser> arch linux compiles for the 686
[23:45] <SnapSnap> When I try to perform a backup, I get the following error: "BackendException: Could not initialize backend: No module named couch.auth"
[23:45] <saltmiser> Joe, you can get your feet wet with xubuntu
[23:45] <escott> !apt | Joe
[23:45] <ubottu> Joe: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome), !Muon (KDE) or !Apper (KDE)
[23:45] <aeon-ltd> latest kernel dropped i386 a while ago
[23:45] <zygoptera> Joe >> According to your system specs, you could possibly do a memory upgrade to 1gb. If it is cheap enough, it might be advisable
[23:45] <saltmiser> aeon-ltd, sorry, does it build for 686 yet or just 486
[23:45] <chuckly> managed to get it booting with live usb however freezes ast freeing unused kernel memory
[23:45] <aeon-ltd> saltmiser: arch?
[23:45] <C4zz1dy> If you're looking for one to learn on, i'd suggest an out of box install first..
[23:45] <saltmiser> aeon-ltd, ubuntu
[23:45] <Joe> Could I get Xubuntu running on it withotu the memory upgrade? If I can tes tit out and I like it, I will possibly upgrade to enhance performance
[23:46] <saltmiser> C4zz1dy, yes an out-of-box install of xubuntu for Joe's older dell laptop
[23:46] <zygoptera> Joe >> yes. Just advisable for the long run
[23:46] <C4zz1dy> oh lol
[23:46] <aeon-ltd> saltmiser: it builds for 686 i think, but you can still use 486. let me google.
[23:46] <C4zz1dy> didn't read that
[23:46] <jarray52> Is the AOC E1649FWU supported on Ubuntu 12.10 in conjunction with a VGA monitor? It's a USB monitor that uses the displaylink driver?
[23:46] <saltmiser> Joe I used xubuntu on a 500 MHz Pentium 3 with 512MB of ram
[23:46] <C4zz1dy> yea try it out with something affordable first
[23:46] <Joe> I will consider it once I get up and running. I will most likely install Xubuntu to learn Linux basics as I've not the slightest clue on a Linux based operating ssytem at this time
[23:47] <C4zz1dy> It's okay, a lot of us are still finding our way around
[23:47] <aeon-ltd> saltmiser: just 386 is dropped, not 486
[23:47] <jarray52> Joe: have you used a Mac before?
[23:47] <saltmiser> Joe, once you get the ropes of driving ubuntu from the command line, you'll be ready for arch linux and gentoo. this may take years however :P
[23:48] <C4zz1dy> lol
[23:48] <Joe> I have used a Mac maybe 3 times to check an E-Mail or look up something on Google :p
[23:48] <C4zz1dy> you mean it WILL take years ;D
[23:48] <C4zz1dy> HAH
[23:48] <Joe> When I said I was clueless on Linuxs based operating systems, I meant it!
[23:48] <escott> aeon-ltd, ubuntu is compiled for 586 or 686 these days
[23:49] <Joe> I believe my Android smartphone uses a Linux based operating system, however I'm not much into the operating system yet :p
[23:49] <aeon-ltd> C4zz1dy: no, learn fast. you'll learn faster by diving into arch. if you can run a vm you can get a little testing playground to work with.
[23:50] <saltmiser> Joe, your fastest, best computer that is personal. does it run windows 7 and was it made after 2010?
[23:50] <Amphibulus> saltmiser, I run ubuntu on a E3-1230v2, 32gb ram with an SSD and a GTX660 with 4 monitors, no lag so far
[23:50] <SnapSnap> When I try to perform a backup, I get the following error: "BackendException: Could not initialize backend: No module named couch.auth"
[23:50] <saltmiser> Joe because if it is new enough, you should install Virtualbox or VMWareplayer on it and you can install computers in there
[23:50] <saltmiser> including windows
[23:50] <Joe> My fastest, best personal computer is my Windows 8 laptop bought right after release
[23:51] <C4zz1dy> Holy crap Amphibulus talk about beastly overkill
[23:51] <saltmiser> Amphibulus, lol but the compiled code is it taking advantage of all the assembly instructiosn your wicked CPU supports?
[23:51] <saltmiser> it _could_ run faster :P :P
[23:51] <Joe> Well my only real reason for switching operating systems is so I can begin using my old tower again
[23:51] <zygoptera> Joe >> looking at your system specs {radeon 9800 video, intel eepro ethernet} should be fine. I am still looking for what sound card you have
[23:51] <chuckly> removed graphics card and it works
[23:51] <saltmiser> Joe I can dig that
[23:51] <C4zz1dy> there's only one reason for 4 screens...
[23:51] <aeon-ltd> C4zz1dy: needs more overclocking...
[23:52] <saltmiser> Joe that Pentium 3 I keep talking about from 1997 I still use. it runs FreeBSD though
[23:52] <Amphibulus> I have 4 X Asus PA238Q
[23:52] <saltmiser> AMD Phenom II X6 3.0 GHz
[23:52] <C4zz1dy> go home Bill Gates, you're drunk
[23:52] <saltmiser> but that has windows booted right now
[23:52] <saltmiser> with ubuntu-server running in a VM
[23:53] <saltmiser> BUT EVERYBODY this is just a transition from arch linux to gentoo for it. the system has 3 hard drives, windows takes up 2 of 'em :P
[23:53] <Joe> Hmm, what do you suggest for a simple operating system to learn the basics of Linux on?
[23:53] <saltmiser> Joe, FreeBSD, but that ain't even Linux
[23:53] <lolcat> Hello
[23:53] <C4zz1dy> hey saltmiser, i've never used ubuntu-server or arch..what're their purposes?
[23:53] <lolcat> How may I mount a wubi .disk image?
[23:53] <aeon-ltd> Joe: basics?=command line?
[23:53] <escott> Joe, but why? if your interest is making an informed judgement about how much you like linux as a desktop OS you should use a VM on your existing system
[23:53] <C4zz1dy> wubi is an .exe installer
[23:53] <saltmiser> escott, no he just wants to use his old tower for soemthing
[23:54] <saltmiser> because windows 98 is useless
[23:54] <C4zz1dy> it's great for powerdorking in IT consultant interviews
[23:54] <escott> Joe, if you just want to toy around with old hardware or have some task that needs limited computational capabilities then using the old machine makes sense
[23:54] <Joe> Basics as in browsing the Internet basics, I've used nothing other than a Windows really haha
[23:54] <lolcat> Please, I need to check this image
[23:54] <saltmiser> Joe when you get it all installed, use google chrome or chromium as the browser, it runs the best
[23:54] <aeon-ltd> Joe: browsers are the same across all oses
[23:54] <escott> Joe, i wouldn't even use a machine from 2003 for browsing the web
[23:55] <saltmiser> C4zz1dy, ubuntu-server, arch linux and freebsd all come with "nothing" installed, no GUI, etc.
[23:55] <escott> Joe, there is too much flash and too much video and too much javascript and too much memory usage
[23:55] <escott> Joe, websites use opengl these days...
[23:55] <saltmiser> C4zz1dy, sometimes I just need a unix shell to do some programming from, doesn't really matter what the OS is and I don't need a gUI
[23:55] <C4zz1dy> oh..
[23:55] <saltmiser> many people like me don't need a GUI
[23:55] <C4zz1dy> so how does one even get "started" with that? :P
[23:55] <saltmiser> just on the computer in front of them
[23:55] <zygoptera> escoot >> I do. I have plenty of computing power, more than enough for linux web browsinh
[23:55] <Joe> A memory upgrade would not be worth it then?
[23:56] <aeon-ltd> saltmiser: wuuuuuuut, file management sucks with guis
[23:56] <aeon-ltd> *without
[23:56] <saltmiser> like I have one computer in front of me running Xubuntu.  But I have about 3 more I'm working with that have no GUI
[23:56] <k1l_> C4zz1dy: ubuntu-server comes without a desktop preinstalled.
[23:56] <saltmiser> aeon-ltd, please, file management is a snap without a gui
[23:56] <escott> Joe, im just questioning the wisdom of this from the perspective of "i want to learn about linux" if you want to learn about linux i would go the VM route
[23:56] <C4zz1dy> aeon-ltd, he's from the matrix :P
[23:56] <saltmiser> easier than with a GUI
[23:56] <Amphibulus> I have 32gb ram it's usefull when you spin up lot of dev box
[23:56] <aeon-ltd> saltmiser: drag/drop > mv
[23:56] <saltmiser> escott, let the man use his ancient tower damnit
[23:56] <namesJay> Hello ppl
[23:56] <saltmiser> aeon-ltd, are you kidding
[23:56] <C4zz1dy> i can't even navigate my download folder on Windows..
[23:56] <saltmiser> aeon-ltd, I write programs to do my file management
[23:56] <saltmiser> python and common lisp
[23:56] <zygoptera> escott >> Joe's machine came standard witha 128mg radeon 9800, It can web browse
[23:57] <saltmiser> hell I used to use common lisp as my login shell
[23:57] <C4zz1dy> <saltmiser> escott, let the man use his ancient tower damnit
[23:57] <Amphibulus> anybody have experience with chef or puppet?
[23:57] <Joe> I am interested in using an old machine for light use. When I said I wanted to learn Linux, I meant the basics and later on maybe get more detailed. I am just looking to put this old tower to some use for the time being
[23:57] <crumychrome> or chroubuntu?
[23:57] <saltmiser> Joe, I understand!
[23:57] <saltmiser> Joe, escott doesn't :P
[23:58] <k1l_> Amphibulus: ask a direct question if its ubuntu support related
[23:58] <C4zz1dy> Yea Joe, go try the distros saltmiser advised :)
[23:58] <saltmiser> Joe, you have a feeling, an itch to fire that old computer up, probably just because it's old, and of all the old things you have that you don't use anymore; this computer is the best example. I totally feel you.
[23:58] <saltmiser> C4zz1dy, he's not ready for those
[23:58] <k1l_> Joe: go with Lubuntu or Xubuntu
[23:58] <saltmiser> you only need those if you live breath and sleep unix
[23:58] <k1l_> Joe: Lubuntu is for slower hardware.
[23:58] <C4zz1dy> I meant the ones u advised for him
[23:58] <C4zz1dy> like eaaaarlier
[23:58] <saltmiser> C4zz1dy, like xubuntu? yeah
[23:59] <C4zz1dy> yep ^^
[23:59] <k1l_> !lubuntu | Joe
[23:59] <ubottu> Joe: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[23:59] <aeon-ltd> ok, lets solve this with a vote, i vote lubuntu.
=== patrick is now known as Guest22353
[23:59] <saltmiser> I vote xubuntu
[23:59] <TheLordOfTime> aeon-ltd, lets not.
[23:59] <crumychrome> i'm a previous windows user - i just installed ubuntu 12.4 onto my chromebook c710....
[23:59] <C4zz1dy> Xubuntu
=== Guest22353 is now known as patchadams
[23:59] <TheLordOfTime> !poll | aeon-ltd
[23:59] <ubottu> aeon-ltd: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[23:59] <saltmiser> lubuntu will give the man a bad impression of what Linux GUI's can provide to the user who wants a simple experience
[23:59] <saltmiser> Lubuntu is too simple
[23:59] <saltmiser> and doesn't look that great either
[23:59] <Joe> that is exactly my feeling :p I just wanna test it out because I started up Windows XP on it and it's terribly slow, I will be installing Xubunutu on it soon and learning the very basic of a Linux operatin system on it
[23:59] <namesJay> 30 m here ...any lady wanna chat?
