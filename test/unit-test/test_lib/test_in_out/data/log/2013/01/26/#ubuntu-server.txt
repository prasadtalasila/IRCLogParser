[03:20] <quietone> we changed from Centos to Ubuntu 12.04 for office samba server for XP boxes.  profiles were 'lost' and users can't change theme etc on new profiles.
[03:20] <quietone> i've been searching all week and have yet to find a fix. Any tips or reading suggestions welcome.
[03:22] <quietone> And apologies for asking about XP here.
[03:23] <sarnold> quietone: did you copy the samba configuration over wholesale? or just merge over the 'important' changes you might have made?
[03:25] <quietone> sarnold, my workmate did most of the work, so I am not sure how to answer. I know smb.conf is identical
[03:26] <sarnold> quietone: is there anything interesting in the log files?
[03:26] <sarnold> quietone: are file permissions on the drive correct? (users can write into their own directories...?)
[03:26] <sarnold> quietone: time for me to bail, hope these help you figure it.. :)
[03:27] <quietone> sarnold, thanks
[03:35] <brad358> can someone who knows how to use samba help me please? i cant seem to edit the settings on it

[14:15] <docjay> hey all - runner server 12.04.  Could someone give me a hand with 'libmysqlclient18' and 'percona-server-common-5.5'?
[14:16] <docjay> when I install one it removes the other and I need both to be installed
[14:16] <docjay> I'm stumped
[14:23] <patdk-lap> you did something odd then
[14:23] <patdk-lap> cause they co-exist fine on my issue
[14:23] <patdk-lap> older build of percona didn't play happy though
[14:27] <patdk-lap> hmm actually, the ubuntu libmysqlclient18 gets replaced with the percona one, no issues
[14:27] <patdk-lap> used to be it wasn't named right, and caused issues
[14:29] <docjay> hey, thkx for your help
[14:29] <docjay> its a fresh install actually
[14:29] <patdk-lap> there is only one catch I can think of
[14:29] <patdk-lap> I don't install the percona from their packages
[14:30] <patdk-lap> but rebuild them into normal packages
[14:30] <docjay> oh, okay, what is the best way?
[14:30] <patdk-lap> not sure if that makes a difference
[14:30] <patdk-lap> do it this way for easy upgrades
[14:31] <docjay> http://pastebin.com/0aWXbXxC
[14:31] <patdk-lap> https://launchpad.net/~patrickdk/+archive/general-lucid/+packages
[14:31] <patdk-lap> oh, that is the issue, libmysqlclient-dev
[14:31] <patdk-lap> why are you installing -dev?
[14:32] <docjay> I'm following a guide to install 'newznab
[14:32] <docjay> http://freek.ws/2012/12/02/basic-tutorial-on-how-to-install-newznab-on-ubuntu-12-04-64-bit/
[14:33] <patdk-lap> seems silly
[14:33] <patdk-lap> do it without the -dev
[14:33] <patdk-lap> the -dev is only needed if you compile stuff yourself
[14:33] <patdk-lap> and nothing on that page is getting compiled. so
[14:34] <docjay> k, lemme try
[14:34] <docjay> unable to locate 'libmysqlclient'
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[14:36] <patdk-lap> hmm, I also wonder why they mention lenny
[14:36] <patdk-lap> oh well, don't use random instructions from people :)
[14:36] <docjay> yeah, I am using precise now
[14:37] <docjay> :)
[14:37] <docjay> what do you suggest
[14:37] <patdk-lap> ya, and percona makes a precise build, so dunno why they would mix in a debian build
[14:37] <patdk-lap> lets see
[14:37] <patdk-lap> remove all mysql stuff
[14:37] <patdk-lap> apt-get purge .*mysql.*
[14:38] <patdk-lap> add percona repo for precise should do it
[14:38] <patdk-lap> then start with installing percona-server-server-5.5
[14:38] <patdk-lap> then try the rest
[14:39] <docjay> will do, adding the repo now
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[14:42] <docjay> finally, the percona config started for me  ;)
[14:43] <patdk-lap> I'm upgrading my last ones from 5.1 to 5.5 right now :)
[14:44] <docjay> what do you think I should do about 'libmysqlcleint'?  you said that I really didn't need the -dev but it can't find it otherwise.
[14:47] <docjay> thanks for your help - how easy was that  :)
[14:48] <patdk-lap> heh?
[14:48] <patdk-lap> the libmysqlclient is a metapackage, it will install libmysqlclient18 in your case
[14:49] <docjay> it all worked just fine.   thanks!

[19:33] <mwcampbell> On a new system, should I install vmbuilder via the python-vm-builder or ubuntu-vm-builder package?
[19:34] <mwcampbell> 12.04
[19:59] <Vasa> I accidently chmodded all my system to 711 and now I can't run any commands
[19:59] <Vasa> is there anything I can do? =/
[20:04] <Vasa> ok i got access
[20:05] <k1ng> lol
[20:05] <Vasa> what is a safe chmod for all the system
[20:05] <Vasa> to fix this problem
[20:05] <k1ng> 665
[20:07] <Vasa> ohhh man thank god it got fixed i was worried =.=
[20:07] <Vasa> xD
[20:08] <Vasa> and thanks for the help k1ng
[20:09] <mdeslaur> Vasa: you likely need to reinstall if you chmodded your whole system. Permissions are now most likely in an insecure state.
[20:10] <k1ng> ^ Vasa do as he said
[20:10] <uvirtbot> k1ng: Error: "Vasa" is not a valid command.
[20:10] <k1ng>  ^ Vasa do as he said
[20:10] <Vasa> ok i should backup then
[20:11] <Vasa> atleast i can backup
[20:15] <Vasa> can chmod 777 somehow damage the system? excpect for the outside security reasons?
[20:23] <fx> hi all, i'm having a bit of a problem, after upgrade to 12.04 i can't bring eth0 up, it shows all zeroes for mac address in ifconfig
[20:23] <fx> The OS runs in a Xen VM, i booted DSL and the interface worked charmingly
[20:30] <fx> I can give it the previous mac, and an ip manually but when i do ifup it just hangs
[20:43] <fx> Bloody udev
[20:43] <fx> removed the rule, restarted, works =9

[23:55] <jacobjames> Anyone know anything about SMB?
[23:55] <jacobjames> does it apply to linux?
[23:55] <jacobjames> How
[23:56] <linuxman44> correct me if i am wrong, but isnt smb only for windows? i think samba might be similar, but thats just a raw guess
[23:56] <patdk-lap> smb was discontinued in windows with xp
[23:58] <RoyK> well, cifs is just smb with signed packages
[23:58] <RoyK> just he same old crap
[23:58] <jacobjames> cifs?
[23:58] <patdk-lap> no, its a lot different
[23:58] <patdk-lap> cifs fixs lot and lots of smb issues
[23:58] <RoyK> no
[23:58] <jacobjames> what is cifs?
[23:59] <RoyK> smb2 fixes a lot more
[23:59] <RoyK> cifs is just signed smb
