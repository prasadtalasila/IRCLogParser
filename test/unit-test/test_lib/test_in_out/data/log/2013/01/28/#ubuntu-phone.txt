[00:20] <saltmiser> alright people
[00:20] <saltmiser> is ubuntu phone open source or not
[00:20] <saltmiser> can I download the source code and build it for my phone?
[00:21] <k1l_> see /topic
[00:21] <saltmiser> right
[00:22] <saltmiser> so
[00:22] <saltmiser> do we really think libreoffice is going to look correct on my 5 inch screen phone
[00:22] <saltmiser> and I don't mean initially but I mean ever..unless there is some way to automagically re-deal with the menus, I don't see it working out :/
[00:22] <saltmiser> I'm not trolling, I realy like the idea of putting my own OS on the phone and ubuntu-phone is a step in the direction
[00:23] <k1l_> ubuntu-phone is not a regular desktop, you know that?
[00:23] <saltmiser> guess not, I didn't know what else to expect
[00:23] <saltmiser> I can't just apt-get install whatever I want?
[00:24] <k1l_> just see the informations mentioned in the site that is linked in the topic :)
[00:24] <saltmiser> lol ok sorry
[00:25] <saltmiser> a QML display hmm?
[00:47] <xsacha> saltmiser: great thing with qml is you can just make a different qml file for a different UI and load them depending on form factor detected (eg. ubuntu phone) if you wish
[00:47] <xsacha> all the actual code can be shared
[00:47] <saltmiser> so, firefox for example
[00:48] <saltmiser> has 3 QML's
[00:48] <saltmiser> 1 for docked
[00:48] <saltmiser> 1 for horizontal and 1 for verticle?
[00:48] <xsacha> horizontal and vertical would go in the same qml
[00:48] <saltmiser> or many for those in big screen and small screen
[00:48] <xsacha> well firefox doesn't even use Qt so it's a bad example
[00:49] <xsacha> big screen/small screen/horizontal/vertical/docked can all be in the same QML though
[00:49] <saltmiser> oh wow this is all with QT4?
[00:49] <xsacha> you'd just want a different layout for different form factors like phones
[00:49] <xsacha> or TVs
[00:49] <saltmiser> I can't find any information on what libraries and stuff all this ubuntu phone stuff is planning to use
[00:49] <saltmiser> like things that mobile developers would be interested in
[00:49] <xsacha> Qt can handle resolution-independence quite well. the problem is the UI needs to be suited to mobiles
[00:50] <saltmiser> right
[00:50] <xsacha> saltmiser: http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/
[00:50] <xsacha> check out #1 for what libraries you need
[00:53] <saltmiser> ok so, when you write an app this way, can it run on normal ubuntu machines and the phones/
[00:56] <saltmiser> I can definitely see this giving android a run for it's money
[00:56] <saltmiser> no more Java?
[00:56] <saltmiser> that's almost a good and bad thing
[00:56] <saltmiser> bad because all that cool stuff we had written for the JVM we can't use anymore
[00:56] <saltmiser> but good because it probably existed for C in the first place, and porting it to Dalvik specifically was annoying
[01:26] <Theorbo> Well, I've left Maemo/MeeGo/Harmattan/Mer/Nemo lot behind and now my sights are set on Ubuntu Phone
[01:26] <Theorbo> I hope it does not disappoint.

[12:46] <Andy80> bzoltan1, I'm ready if we want to start earlier :)
[12:47] <bzoltan1>  Andy80:  good idea
[15:41] <dpm> hi bzoltan1, I don't know if you've seen it, but here's an interesting post from aquarius re: designing resolution-independent apps with the toolkit: https://plus.google.com/u/0/108243663090085262773/posts/CsJsMsvQKbv
[15:43] <Robbilie> nice one!
[15:44] <Robbilie> i think canonical should already release the source of these amazing rings, that would have spared me a lot of time xD
=== jono is now known as Guest10241
[15:54] <dpm> Robbilie, we'll be releasing the code very soon, don't worry :)
[16:00] <wfire> I am still having trouble getting Qt Creator to even see the ubuntu components :(
[16:00] <wfire> seems like the same old fights again
[16:00] <wfire> from trying to get crap to work with Nokia
[16:09] <Robbilie> dpm wanna see smthng? or did you follow our earlier conversations? :)
[16:20] <Robbilie> dpm, http://jsfiddle.net/Robbilie/7CbDn/36/show/
[16:33] <dpm> Robbilie, it looks pretty awesome, but could you give me a bit of context? I did not follow the previous conversation
[16:34] <Robbilie> well its just that i cant wait for ubu-phone so i did me a little web version myself <3

[16:34] <Robbilie> bzoltan1, what do you mean?
[16:34] <bzoltan1>  Robbilie:  The resolution independence demo
[16:35] <Robbilie> mine?!
[16:36] <bzoltan1> Robbilie:  I have seen your stuff too and that is amazing work as well :)
[16:36] <Robbilie> ah now i now what you meant bzoltan1  xD that one is nice too :P
[16:36] <Robbilie> and thanks ;)
[16:38] <bzoltan1> Robbilie:  After we have released the QML toolkit I had time to think about how to extend the same visual concept and user experience to html5 apps. Your work is truly inspiring!
[16:38] <bzoltan1> mhall119^
[16:39] <Robbilie> bzoltan1, : when i started webdesign, i used to use jquery and ui toolkits and such... but then i moved over to only jquery and my own ui, not really responsive and jquery, well it had some nice features but when i looked at the loading time of my website i was so shoked that i stopped using it
[16:40] <mhall119> bzoltan1: ?
[16:40] <Robbilie> now i completly used pure js and then i found out about responsive design :D
[16:40] <Robbilie> my true love <3 xD

[19:56] <shaneo1> is anyone thinking of working on a navigation app like google maps ....?
[19:58] <Robbilie> well there will be maps so why choose smthn different?
[20:00] <shaneo1> im just asking as I work in the corparate business sector and always on the road, navigation is essential to me
[20:01] <Robbilie> well do you think having a "not default os" on your business phone a good idea...
[20:01] <Robbilie> ?
[20:03] <shaneo1> what would you suggest then?
[20:03] <Robbilie> using a second phone for testing or at least to check out if the functionality is daily drivable :)
[20:04] <shaneo1> thats what im getting at yes.
[20:05] <Robbilie> just to ensure that you dont get a fail in a situation you couldnt afford it, like you said ;)
[20:05] <shaneo1> oh nevermind, forget I even asked.
