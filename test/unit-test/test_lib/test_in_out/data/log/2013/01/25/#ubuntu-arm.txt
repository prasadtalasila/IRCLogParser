[01:55] <AmEv> Well, I've got a near-chroot method working.
[01:55] <AmEv> *chroot method near-working...
[01:55] <AmEv> Now I've figured out how the Ubuntu for Android guys did it... haha
[01:58] <AmEv> Any ARM Xorg guys on right now?
[02:26] <slangasek> ogra_: so my 'ssh hangs hard when I try to connect to my nexus7' bug is still here, even after repeated reinstalls

[07:39] <wingze> hi
[07:39] <wingze> i'm trying to cross compile a kernel on my desktop for a panda board but i get an dependency error
[07:40] <wingze> but the dependencys are met and i still get that error
[07:48] <mjrosenb> wingze: what error?
[07:53] <dholbach> good morning
[07:56] <highvoltage> good morning
[07:57] <wingze> dpkg-checkbuilddeps: Unmet build dependencies: libelf-dev libnewt-dev binutils-dev libdw-dev libgtk2.0-dev | gtk2-devel
[07:57] <wingze> i have all that installed but still get the error
[08:08] <wingze> this is crazy
[08:12] <wingze> ok got it working it was a build dependency error it needed gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi

[09:50] <sveinse> I have a headless target which plymouth is not installed, and I'm missing some of the logs from initramfs, even when I have console= console= in the kernel commandline. Is it possible to get this log out on the console, or do I need plymouth even on a headless system?
[10:58] <xnox> sveinse: plymouth has text-mode plugins & can run fine on headless and output text.
[10:59] <xnox> sveinse: i dunno how to do this without plymouth.
[11:19] <asiekierka> is there any reasonably priced 10" tablet that can run Ubuntu well
[11:19] <asiekierka> bonus points for Flash support in any way, shape or form (for livestreams that don't HTML5)
[11:47] <sveinse> xnox: Hmm. plymouth is installed after all (dep'd by mountall). But for some reason nothing appears in the console during initramfs. I have another device (another kernel) also with the console= console= bootcmd construct, but here it does work.
[11:48] <sveinse> Kernel config perhaps. Don't remember seeing any config related to that (since the initial printk of the kernel is output properly on the console)
[12:21] <lilstevie> asiekierka: flash is a no go with ubuntu-arm
[12:22] <lilstevie> asiekierka: for 10" tablets I don't really know of one that runs it "well", especially at a reasonable price, it runs fine on the tf201 but that isn't reasonably priced, and while fine I wouldn't call it "well"

[13:40] <ogra_> janimo, hmm, your HDA trick doesnt work if i build the HDA driver as module
[13:40] <ogra_> :(
[13:40] <janimo> well we build it in I suggest
[13:40] <janimo> most our hw stuff is built-in anyway
[13:40] <janimo> as we know it is there
[13:40] <ogra_> well, i'm *extremely* short on bootimg space
[13:40] <janimo> ah I remember
[13:41] <janimo> how much more can fit there?
[13:41] <ogra_> so modular would indeed be preferred if we add any stuff
[13:41] <ogra_> -1M
[13:41] <ogra_> :P
[13:41] <janimo> ohm that should fit fine then for a while :)
[13:41] <ogra_> the boot is slow enough that it justifies to have plymouth in the initrd
[13:42] <ogra_> which i cant do atm
[13:42] <janimo> I did not look closely at what we have modular or built-in
[13:42] <ogra_> everything is builtin
[13:42] <janimo> I think the majority of settings are as in the original android kernel
[13:42] <ogra_> well, nearly at least
[13:42] <ogra_> vmlinuz is 4.5M
[13:43] <ogra_> (ac100 is 1.2 or so)
[13:43] <janimo> I say when we hit that limit, we take out non-essential hw stuff (maybe all the USB peripherals)
[13:43] <ogra_> you dont get it ? we are about 1M above
[13:43] <janimo> and high-level networking and fss
[13:43] <janimo> ah, aboce? I thought 1M to go
[13:43] <ogra_> it currently only works due to some evil hacks and diversions i add
[13:43] <janimo> that - 1M confused me
[13:44] <ogra_> well, you asked how much more :)
[13:44] <janimo> well I thought you said dash 1M not minus 1M
[13:44]  * ogra_ is neadly done with a set of quietening patches for the boot
[13:44] <ogra_> *nearly
[13:45] <janimo> well anything not strictly tegraSoC hw could be modular IMHO
[13:45] <ogra_> theoretically
[13:45] <ogra_> sadly practically that will fall over in many places
[13:45] <janimo> well FSs that are not ext4, TCP, and other bits Asus/Google did not modify should be fine I think
[13:46] <janimo> Iknow battery and some other bits don't work as modules
[13:46] <ogra_> all the non std drivers that are woven into android stuff usually require to be builtin
[13:46] <janimo> right, but the big space consumers are network,fs and the rest of the code
[13:46] <ogra_> battery, wlan, bluetooth, i bet the accelerometer and all other sensors too
[13:46] <janimo> so if we can make those modular it should fix the bootimg size issue
[13:46] <janimo> right, but those are all relatively small footprint  i bet
[13:47] <ogra_> well, wlan would really help
[13:47] <ogra_> we could drop all network bits to modules that way (protocols etc)
[13:47] <ogra_> wlan itself wont gain us much, but firewall, protocols etc
[14:15] <janimo> ogra_, do we have a nexus meeting today?
[14:16] <ogra_> yup
[14:18] <ogra_> GRRR !
[14:18] <ogra_> i just had the boot quiet ...
[14:19] <ogra_> enabling HDA gets me another message on the screen
[14:19] <ogra_> why cant people use pr_info for info messages instead of pr_err
[14:19] <ogra_> grmbl
[14:20] <janimo> ogra_, is onboard not working when the gksu dialog after apport pops up a known issue?
[14:20] <ogra_> yes, gksu is supposed to go asap
[14:20] <janimo> I seem to have seen lots of onboard related bugs filed but am not sure which are still relevznt
[14:20] <janimo> what replaces gksu?
[14:20] <ogra_> pkexec, since about 4 releases now
[14:21] <janimo> I keep getting an apport dialog on each session start, but cannot send the report due to this
[14:21]  * janimo never heard of pkexec
[14:21] <ogra_> yet you use it all the time :)
[14:21] <janimo> so by asap you mean a couple weeks or a couple more cycles? :)
[14:22] <ogra_> its part of policykit/consolekit
[14:22] <ogra_> i mean this cycle
[14:22] <ogra_> there are two apps left that need porting, then we can unseed gksu
[14:22] <ogra_> one is update-notifier (which is the apport bit you see) and the other is xdiagnose
[14:22] <janimo> I don't know what makes up the 'January-2013 Linux Plumbing stack'
[14:23] <ogra_> where does that come from ?
[14:23] <janimo> I can only assume it is different from 'December 2012 Linux Plumbing stack' and 'February 2013 Linux Plumbing stack'
[14:24] <ogra_> oh, you mean wrt pkexec :)
[14:24] <janimo> wrt the whole moving thing which keeps getting in the way of actually writing features
[14:24] <janimo> half-joking
[14:25] <ogra_> yay, completely quiet boot !
[14:25] <janimo> everything from kernel up until the login manager
[14:25] <ogra_> if we now just could have plymouth in initrd
[14:26] <janimo> ogra_, what happened to the no initrd at all attempt?
[14:26] <ogra_> i got stuck at the console-setup race
[14:26] <ogra_> and was told bootspped isnt a prio anymore
[14:26] <ogra_> *speed
[14:27] <ogra_> so for now i just care about it having bling :)
[14:27] <lilstevie> marvin24_: nope
[14:28] <lilstevie> marvin24_: probably should work on that
[14:31] <infinity> janimo: Who's on armadaxp SRU duty right now?  You or Ike?
[14:31] <janimo> Ike I guess
[14:31] <infinity> Kay.  We have a rushed revert in master that needs a quick rebase for derivatives.
[14:32] <janimo> I was told I'd be doing non-SRU stuff last December, so my last armadaxp thing was the B0 enablement in Precise
[14:32] <janimo> but if I misunderstood I can be convinced otherwise
[14:32] <janimo> infinity, or if there's an emergency I can of course try handling it
[14:33] <ogra_> what happened to NCommander ?
[14:33] <ogra_> doesnt he do any server kernel work anymore ?
[14:33] <janimo> ogra_, not on armadaxp at least
[14:34] <infinity> janimo: I'll ping Ike.
[14:34] <ogra_> janimo, btw, compiling HDA in or as module doesnt get me any sound working (suspend/resume still does)
[14:34] <ogra_> are you sure your HDA stuff isnt just a red herring ?
[14:34] <janimo> ogra_, very strange. I got that repeatedly after enabling it
[14:34] <janimo> well I am not 100% sure, it just worked in my testing
[14:35] <janimo> ogra do you have the volume turned on at boot?
[14:35] <ogra_> no, it is muted
[14:35] <ogra_> but unmuting doesnt get me any sound
[14:35] <janimo> that sucks
[14:36]  * ogra_ tries another reboot
[14:36] <janimo> could it be i accidentally set some alsa configs which made it work? I'll dump my alsa state and paste it
[14:36] <ogra_> now that rotation works wutomatically, we should probably consider to just boot in portrait
[14:37] <janimo> ogra_, alsa store gives me this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569919/
[14:38] <janimo> ogra_, I agree with portrait booting. needs to drop the fbcon rotate cmdline arg too
[14:38] <ogra_> it also doesnt seem to make any difference if HDA is card 0 or 1
[14:38] <janimo> ogra_, so reboot and still no sound?
[14:38] <ogra_> janimo, and i think yoiu did a hack to the touch driver to switch to 1280x800 from 800x1280
[14:39] <ogra_> i guess we need to drop that too
[14:39] <ogra_> janimo, right, but sound after resume
[14:39] <janimo> ogra_, right, I tested with that dropped this week
[14:39] <janimo> will need the matrices shuffled in the rotate scripts
[14:39] <ogra_> great, telly me once it entered the kernel and i'll adjust the cmdline
[14:39] <janimo> but better that way so portrait is the 'normal' one
[14:39] <janimo> and we drop that needless delta vs the android kernel
[14:39] <ogra_> right
[14:40] <ogra_> and getting plymouth inoto landscape seems impossible anyway
[14:40] <janimo> ogra_, btw the cmdline could be altered separately no? Isn't that only affecting the fbcon (so bootup messages) ?
[14:40] <ogra_> separately from ?
[14:40] <janimo> from the rotate script and kernel stuff
[14:40] <ogra_> the cmdline has two parts, first is hardcoded in the bootloader ...
[14:41] <ogra_> second is from abootimg
[14:41] <ogra_> the abootimg part can be altered
[14:41] <janimo> right, abootimg fbcon rotate=1
[14:41] <ogra_> yeah
[14:41] <janimo> which is only about display in console mode
[14:41] <ogra_> i'll drop that from the builds as soon as the kernel fix is there
[14:41] <janimo> the kernel bit is only about touch input
[15:00] <ogra_> janimo, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569980/
[15:01] <ogra_> thats the diff to my automatically stored asound.state file
[15:01] <ogra_> (yours is +)
[15:01] <ogra_> seems you played with all the controls :)
[15:02] <ogra_> i wonder if you probably stil have sound working if you now disable HDA in your kernel
[15:49] <janimo> ogra_, can you try this .deb? http://people.canonical.com/~jani/linux-image-3.1.10-8-nexus7_3.1.10-8.21_armhf.deb
[15:49] <ogra_> sure
[15:49] <janimo> I freshly rebuilt with the HDA and the axes inversion changes
[15:49] <janimo> it works for me if I set the volume up (it is again off at boot)
[15:51] <ogra_> bah, the noise is back at boot :P
[15:52] <ogra_> nope
[15:52] <ogra_> no sound
[15:53] <ogra_> janimo, how exactly do you test btw ?
[15:53]  * ogra_ just relies on the plop plop from the volume control applet
[15:53] <ogra_> (when adjusting with the buttons)
[15:54] <janimo> ogra_, canberra-gtk-play --file=/usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/glass.ogg
[15:54] <ogra_> geez, complex
[15:55] <ogra_> ergh
[15:55] <janimo> well, I have no media to play, and this is a simple thing to test via ssh
[15:55] <ogra_> and indeed the touchscreen is totally screwed now
[15:55] <janimo> with export DISPLAY=:0 of course
[15:55] <ogra_> well, i just press vol-up/down
[15:55] <ogra_> makes an event sound if audio works
[15:58]  * ogra_ reboots back to a sane kernel that likes my touching :P
[16:01] <janimo> ogra_, so no sound with this deb?
[16:01] <ogra_> janimo, right
[16:01] <ogra_> well, after resume i had it
[16:01] <ogra_> as with my kernel
[16:01] <ogra_> well, lets have a meeting :)
[16:02] <janimo> ogra_, well with this kernel I get sound without having to do suspend
[16:03] <janimo> ogra_, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1570120/ the matrices changed around to have rotation work with this deb
[16:03] <janimo> to be uploaded once we have the kernel change
[16:34] <janimo> xnox, Bus 001 Device 067: ID 04e8:6866 Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd
[16:34] <janimo> Galaxy Nexus
[16:37] <xnox> janimo: thanks.
[16:39] <janimo> anyone else with a nexus 7 willing to test the deb I linked above to see if it fixes the no sound on boot problem?
[16:40] <Tassadar> yeah, why not, tell me what to do
[16:42] <Tassadar> just install and reboot I guess)
[16:42] <ogra_> right, like we discussed in the meeting :)
[16:43] <janimo> Tassadar, yes, install and reboot but make sure you have ssh enabled or a keyboard or mouse
[16:43] <janimo> as the touchscreen will be messed up :)
[16:43] <janimo> via ssh then export DISPLAY=:0
[16:43] <janimo> and  canberra-gtk-play --file=/usr/share/sounds/gnome/default/alerts/glass.ogg
[16:43] <janimo> or any other sound playing app you wish
[16:44] <Tassadar> okay, I'll just update my installation first
[16:44] <janimo> for me this works on boot without having to issue a suspend
[16:44] <janimo> but you may need to turn the volume on
[16:56] <Tassadar> hmm, it does not work for me
[16:57] <ogra_> Tassadar, does it work after a suspend cycle (as it did before)
[16:57] <Tassadar> yes
[16:57] <AmEv> Anyone got some initfs advice for me? I'm trying to get Ubuntu to run natively on the Toshiba Thrive.
[16:58] <Tassadar> just to make sure it is right kernel, my /proc/version looks like this:
[16:58] <Tassadar> Linux version 3.1.10-8-nexus7 (jani@parapapio) (gcc version 4.7.2 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.7.2-19ubuntu1) ) #21 SMP PREEMPT Fri Jan 25 16:55:55 EET 2013
[16:58] <Tassadar> so I think it is the right one
[16:58] <Tassadar> yeah, it is, the touch screen is messed up
[17:00] <AmEv> I was able to get into a chroot Ubuntu, but the X server never displayed anything. I know it had access to the framebuffer because there was garbage on the display before I started it.
[17:00] <Tassadar> it doesn't need any modules or cmdline params during boot or something like that, does it? You said it is built in the kernel, right?
[17:04] <janimo> Tassadar, yes it is the right kernel - especially since the touchscreen handling is broken right
[17:04] <janimo> Tassadar, indeed no extra boot params
[17:04] <janimo> Tassadar, thanks for testing
[17:04] <janimo> I am building anothe deb now without the messed up touch now
[17:05] <Tassadar> theres one hda-codec message if that's any help, "hda-codec: No codec parser is available"
[17:07] <janimo> Tassadar, I have that too in dmesg
=== XenGi is now known as XenGi_
[17:19] <AmEv> Would I need to set a custom cmdline when I make the boot image on mine? If so, what?
[17:24] <janimo> Tassadar, btw I put a new deb at the same URL, this time without the messed up screen
[17:25] <janimo> did you test with the canberra command line ?
[17:25] <janimo> ogra_, did you test with that canberra line btw?
[17:26] <janimo> that works for me but playing an mp3 in rhythmbox is silent
[17:27] <janimo> or rather it plays crack. I think I'll soon do a test-reinstall :)
[17:29] <ogra_> well, we dont ship any mp3 codecs
[17:30] <ogra_> rebooting to your latest kernel now
[17:32] <janimo> ogra_, well I installed mpg123 and rhythmbox installed its own
[17:32] <janimo> my alsa settings are likely broken now
[17:32] <janimo> not sure how the gtk player just works
[17:32] <ogra_> anyway, no change with the kernel from the ML
[17:32] <janimo> volume up?
[17:32] <AmEv> Hmmm... Sound works perfectly, but I'm not getting anything to display.
[17:32] <ogra_> and yes, i used the canberra methid too
[17:33] <ogra_> *method
[17:33] <AmEv> You and I are in completely opposite sides of the spectrum... haha
[17:33] <ogra_> volume is indeed up
[17:33] <janimo> AmEv, does sound not work for you with the regular kernel unless suspending first?
[17:34] <AmEv> I'm actually on a Tegra 2 device in a Android-to-Ubuntuchroot.
[17:34] <AmEv> I have absolutely zero speaker issues.
[17:34] <AmEv> My problem is that I can't get anything to display.
[17:35] <ogra_> what do you want to display ?
[17:35] <ogra_> android doesnt ship an X server
[17:35] <Tassadar> janimo: no, no sound until suspend/resume
[17:35] <ogra_> right, same here
[17:35] <AmEv> I've got Ubuntu on an SD card.
[17:35] <Tassadar> but touchscreen works)
[17:35] <AmEv> Chroot.
[17:36] <ogra_> AmEv, but you are aware that ubuntu apps use X ?
[17:36] <AmEv> Yes.
[17:36] <janimo> Tassadar, mine is a 16G model if that is any help but I doubt it has to do with the model
[17:36] <Tassadar> mine too
[17:36] <AmEv> I'm trying to start X, but nothing's displaying.
[17:36] <ogra_> android doesnt ship an X server, you cant display anything
[17:37] <ogra_> janimo, i really think HDA is a red herring ...
[17:37] <ogra_> janimo, but i also think you must have something that makes it work :)
[17:37] <janimo> ogra_, could well be
[17:37] <janimo> yes, so I should not just wipe and reinstall
[17:37] <janimo> I may have a gem here somewhere
[17:37] <janimo> :)
[17:37] <ogra_> we should consult diwic again
[17:38] <AmEv> I've built an X-compatible kernel. I've been able to get Zygote, Surfaceflinger, Media, and DRM stopped, then chroot into Ubuntu, and start X.
[17:38] <AmEv> My final goal is to get a working native, zero-Android solution.
[17:38] <AmEv> Kernel source is https://github.com/Thrive-Hackers/tostab3-gnu-linux-kernel
[17:39] <janimo> ok, indeed it now works with the stock kernel
[17:39] <janimo> sigh
[17:39] <janimo> my nexus just got fixed and I don't know how
[17:40] <AmEv> In the meantime, I'm trying to esssentially shut down Android and shut down Ubuntu.
[17:40] <Tassadar> both bohdi and plasma have sound working without suspend, but I don't see jeff here right now :/
[17:40] <AmEv> *start up Ubuntu
[17:41]  * janimo wonders whether bodhi and plasma are applications or people
[17:41] <Tassadar> distributions)
[17:42] <Tassadar> bohdi is based on debian and plasma active on MER (it is "kde on tablet" project), but both use ubuntu's kernel
[17:43] <AmEv> Still, if someone does want to try remoting in, I'm willing to.

[18:23] <AmEv> I should probably mention that I was using http://blog.rot13.org/2012/08/x11-running-on-nook-color-without-android-stack.html as a basis for a lot of what I was doing...
[18:33] <slangasek> ogra_: hmm, any idea why modem-manager in raring takes over /dev/ttyACM0 when I connect my nexus7 to my raring laptop?
[18:34] <ogra_> nope, thats a qerustion for cyphermox i think, we noticed other modemmanager issues as well, might be the same bug, not sure
[18:34] <ogra_> *question even
[18:37] <slangasek> ah, it apparently opens the port several times and takes a long time to probe it, but eventually lets go
[18:37] <ogra_> yeah, it sends AT commands
[18:37] <ogra_> seems it does that for the serial gadget connection too
[18:37] <ogra_> which can confuse getty a bit
[18:38] <ogra_> slangasek, btw, make sure to upgrade to the latest, there were a ton of fixes this week
[18:38] <slangasek> this was installed yesterdy
[18:38] <ogra_> well, we didnt have images for the whole week :)
[18:39] <slangasek> we did yesterday
[18:39] <ogra_> oh, i missed that, only saw that todays failed
[18:39] <ogra_> perfect then :)
[18:50]  * ogra_ goes for dinner
[18:55] <AmEv> Yep. My audio device is tegra8903. Perfect sound in Ubuntu.
