[08:06] <elky> anyone else think that the !anyone response could be edited with prompts like "what are you trying to achieve?"
[08:07] <elky> "your real question" is a bit silly. it's still a real question
[08:08] <gnomefreak> !anyne
[08:08] <gnomefreak> !anyone
[08:08] <ubottu> A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[08:31] <bazhang> elky, yes, good point. the factoid could use some freshening up
[08:34] <gnomefreak> i agree
[08:39] <elky> "You'll get much better answers if you state your problem or goal from the start, instead of asking who uses certain things. What are you trying to achieve, and what is the problem or error stopping you?"
[08:42] <bazhang> quite good, one slight modification might be "by stating" instead of "if you state"
[08:47] <elky> actually s/stating/saying/ for people who don't grasp "state"
[08:48] <elky> So, it'd be: You'll get much better answers by saying your problem or goal from the start, instead of asking who uses certain things. What are you trying to achieve, and what is the problem or error stopping you?
[08:48] <elky> I'll leave it there for more eyes to look it over
[08:49] <Tm_T> looks good to me
[08:50] <bazhang> yep

[15:43] <Pricey> Hmm just got a bit of spam that I suspect is from #ubuntu
[15:44] <k1l> that sounds like we would spam for ubuntu :)
[15:45] <Pricey> Aha and it isn't just me... I see a report in #ubuntu. I'll look into it.
[15:52] <Psi-Jack> Is there a !op trigger or something in use in #ubuntu? I was trying to report YoltA whom seems to be, highly likely, whom seems to be PM spamming, most likely en-mass.
[15:54] <Pici> Psi-Jack: just got one myself too
[15:54] <Psi-Jack> Cool. :)
[15:55] <Psi-Jack> I figured it was en-mass, based on the content. Probably timed to be slow enough, too.
[15:55] <Pici> Psi-Jack: The Â¡op factoid does work, but it works like any other factoid, so you'd need to use | with it.  Most ops here have the word itself on highlight though
[15:56] <Psi-Jack> Heh, yeah. Cool. I couldn't remember, because your factoid bot is... Strange.. With the whole | seperator. :)
[15:57] <Psi-Jack> Anyway, thanks. Wanted to help make sure the problem was made aware. :)
[16:01] <k1l> ich got the nick Yolta in my bash history for grepping my logs i think there were some issues before that
[16:04] <Pici> Pricey: If you're talking about Yolta, I ended up banning them.
[16:16] <Pricey> k1l: Doesn't surprise me, I'm sure I recognise it from yonks ago.
[16:16] <Pricey> Pici: ack.
[17:28] <cprofitt> I am lost with the Yolta and yonks stuff... grepping I got though :-)
[17:29] <Pici> spam
[20:57] <ubottu> FloodBot1 called the ops in #ubuntu-ops-monitor (repeated abuse from tion)
[23:25] <beatsonline> Hi there.. can someone 'un-ban  me ' from #lubuntu channel, as I'm over my problems now.
[23:27] <beatsonline> cprofitt: BTW.. Are you the Cnet guy ??
[23:29] <ikonia> hi beatsonline
[23:29] <beatsonline> Aloha
[23:30] <ikonia> whats the issue with the lubuntu channel ?
[23:30] <beatsonline> Dunno, I'm just banned from over a month ago ...
[23:31] <ikonia> why ?
[23:31] <beatsonline> I told a guy where to go ... sorry for that.
[23:31] <ikonia> that's fair enough, you know it was wrong your sorry
[23:31] <beatsonline> true.
[23:32] <ikonia> let me see if I can see one of the lubuntu ops active
[23:34] <Unit193> beatsonline: Why did you deem it necessary to tell the person trying to help you to "Fuck off" and quit?
[23:40] <Unit193> beatsonline: Are you still on?
[23:40] <ikonia> Perfie: could you please hold on
[23:40] <Perfie> You know, being an op for ubuntu would look great on my resume.
[23:41] <Perfie> ikonia, hold onto wut
[23:41] <ikonia> Perfie: someone else is in a discussion at the moment.
[23:47] <beatsonline> Unit193, I was trying something new and I got fustrated with the world at large, as computers sometimes do that to people, but TBH it was wrong and nothing personal. I'm sorry and apologise.
[23:50] <beatsonline> but I basically got tired of the Unit nick thing and thought I was talking to a machine .. which isn't too far stretched as Unit 193 is pretty impersonal when you are stressed, but I was wrong.
[23:51] <ikonia> beatsonline: there isn't a lubuntu op around at the moment as Unit193 had to leave,
[23:51] <ikonia> beatsonline: however if you leave it with me I'll attempt to get it sorted
[23:51] <ikonia> I'm assuming it won't happen again
[23:51] <ikonia> you seem to grasp fine that it was wrong, and why
[23:52] <beatsonline> Please allow me to be frank, I'm a moderator on several social networks for lubuntu OS ..and frankly it is embarrassing not being able to ask the #channel, once in a while.
[23:52] <univyrse> I was removed from ubuntu by some prick while I was talking about the recently unveiled ubuntu phone
[23:53] <ikonia> beatsonline: I understand, as there is no-one around, I can only say I'll try to get it sorted ASAP
[23:53] <ikonia> beatsonline: can you give it a few hours please ?
[23:53] <ikonia> univyrse: I'll get to you in a moment, I've muted you to give you chance to calm down and think about how you speak to people when we talk
[23:53] <beatsonline> i hav to go to bed,but there is no rush, honestly.
[23:54] <ikonia> beatsonline: no problem, thank you
[23:54] <beatsonline> how did you know who i was even thou. I have changed my nick BTW ??
[23:55] <ikonia> the lubuntu ops have a tracking system
[23:55] <beatsonline> figures.
[23:55] <ikonia> beatsonline: drop back tomorrow and hopefully I'll have got it sorted
[23:55] <ikonia> (by then)
[23:55] <ikonia> acceptable ?
[23:55] <beatsonline> yep.
[23:55] <beatsonline> thanx.
[23:56] <ikonia> great, I'll leave a note for the other ops if I can't find one before the morning
[23:56] <ikonia> but I will address it
[23:57] <ikonia> beatsonline: if you /part so we can deal with others, that would be appreciated
[23:57] <ikonia> Perfie: what's the problem ?
[23:57] <ikonia> univyrse: you're after Perfie
[23:58] <Perfie> does that really work?
[23:58] <Perfie> the whole wait in line thing
[23:58] <ikonia> as best possible,
[23:58] <ikonia> now what's up
[23:59] <Perfie> I'm just idling
[23:59] <ikonia> Perfie: please don't, you know that's not something the channel appreciates
