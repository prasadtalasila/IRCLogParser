[00:41] <cjohnston> Is bug #813511 worth patching? It was fixed upstream >1 year ago, I guess there is a disconnect somewhere between upstream and making it into Ubuntu.

[07:26] <dholbach> good morning
[08:13] <bkerensa> is requestsync depracated?
[08:23] <geser> no, why?
[08:24] <geser> but there is no need to use requestsync if you have upload rights and can sync the package yourself
[09:13] <xnox> bkerensa: there is requestsync (when one doesn't have upload rights) and syncpackage (for sponsoring or when one does have upload rights)
[09:15] <bkerensa> xnox: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1540656/ <-- I get that error with requestsync
[09:15] <bkerensa> output even
[09:16] <xnox> bkerensa: please upgrade devscripts package to the one that fixed that.
[09:17] <xnox> 2.12.6ubuntu1 is bad, 2.12.6ubuntu2 or 2.12.6 are good
[09:18] <Laney> yeah that is a good fix
[09:18] <Laney> thanks for doing that
[09:19] <bkerensa> xnox ok
[09:19] <xnox> Laney: np.
[09:23] <Laney> both of them aren't forwarded to debian #680313 yet though ;-)
[09:23] <ubottu> Debian bug 680313 in devscripts "devscripts: support python 3 (hopefully dropping strict python2.7 dependancy)" [Wishlist,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/680313
[09:26] <bkerensa> Laney: well ya know submittodebian acts funky with changes ;)
[09:26] <Laney> hmm?
[09:28] <bkerensa> cjohnston:  bug #813511 the reason the fix has not landed in Ubuntu is because we appear to sync the package unchanged from debian and debian has not updated the package from upstream

[09:29] <ubottu> bug 1021917 in ubuntu-dev-tools (Ubuntu) "[submittodebian]'s update-maintainer reversal isn't always the right thing to do" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1021917
[09:30] <Laney> how's that related to the devscripts patches?
[09:31] <bkerensa> Laney: well whoever fixed it could have used submittodebian but it sometimes reverses the maintainer info
[09:32] <Laney> sounds annoying but not really something that would block patch forwarding
[09:32] <Laney> anyway, you sound like you plan on fixing it ;-)
[09:32] <tumbleweed> bkerensa: that bug was caused by an attempt to fix that bug
[09:32] <tumbleweed> I made it reverse the maintainer info, when it used to not reverse it, and vice-versa
[09:32]  * Laney doesn't really use submittodebian so can't comment
[09:32] <Laney> it's about the only time I remember to set those usertags though
[09:33] <tumbleweed> most of the time I want to set other usertags too, but you can only set one usertag on submission
[09:33] <Laney> even with the fancy Control: headers?
[09:34] <Laney> haven't used those so much either
[09:34] <tumbleweed> hrm, can one use those at submission?
[09:35] <Laney> yep

[15:38] <aboudreault> any java expert? Trying to build something that uses maven... but when building in pbuilder... we have an error related to  the fact that maven tries to find /root/.m2/settings.xml
[15:39] <aboudreault> what's the proper way to  build something with maven?
[16:29] <Laney> can I update the timestamp but keep the name/email when doing dch --release?

[18:11] <micahg> Laney: are there any plans to migrate to ghc 7.6?
[18:11] <Laney> yeah
[18:11] <Laney> they all start with "Laney needs to find some time to figure out how complete it is in Debian"
[18:12] <micahg> I was thinking we should set up a copy of the tracker pointed at proposed so that we can see how installable both sets are
[18:12] <Laney> they all already point at proposed
[18:13] <micahg> ah, ok
[18:13] <Laney> i'll set one up pointing at /experimental/ soon hopefully
[18:13] <micahg> I think we need a copy pointing at the release pocket as well then
[18:14] <Laney> why?
[18:14] <micahg> unless britney properly understands haskell reverse deps
[18:14] <Laney> pretty sure it does
[18:14] <Laney> probably will require some hinting, but that's fine
[19:16] <psusi> so if I want to test a program's output in german, isn't it sufficient to install languagepack-german, then export LANG=de?
