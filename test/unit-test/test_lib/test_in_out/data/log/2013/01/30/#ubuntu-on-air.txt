[19:11] <LukeBee> QUESTION: Will USC be getting a redesign any time soon?
[19:11] <pemibo> QUESTION:  Will there be an integrated update service in ubuntu phone OS or will we need to flash a new image every new release?
[19:11] <rrnwexec> QUESTION: Can you talk about the work that is going on around the Ubuntu Tablet (i.e. the Nexus 7)? (It seems the phone has taken a bit of the spotlight off of that.)

[19:15] <JoseeAntonioR> DarthVader: +1
[19:15] <Paulo_> QUESTION: Asking the user about the online searches at installation time, with no default answer, is not a viable solution for our "privacy concerns". Maybe something like two buttons 'Yes/No', with no default.
[19:15] <klakus> QUESTION: Does Canonical plan to develop its own graphical tools for ideally all os aspects management for Ubuntu?

[19:18] <Guest42> QUESTION: What is canonicals plan about compiz? Do you use compiz on the phone?
[19:20] <Scrivener> QUESTION: Ubuntu partners with some OEMs to get Ubuntu on a few laptops, but has Ubuntu ever considered partnering with hardware manufacturers by selling their hardware (maybe rebranded, maybe not) from an Ubuntu shop experience? That is, if there is hardware that works very well with Ubuntu, could Ubuntu sell that hardware from an Ubuntu-specific web store? A new user wants to get a webcam, and they'd no longer have to search for Ubun
[19:20] <Scrivener> tu-compatible ones (like the Logitech C615 I just purchased). They could just go to your store, and maybe Ubuntu could get a cut of sales that way while basically just "advertising" the product. Everybody wins.
[19:21] <snwh> Ubuntu Death Star edition, I like it.
[19:21] <DanS> Hey DarthVader.. just make sure you do a 'sudo apt-get xx-9-heavy-turbolaser'

[19:23] <rrnwexec> QUESTION: Should "everyday folks" that enjoy Ubuntu (but don't dig into the code) care whether Ubuntu moves to a rolling-release strategy? The volume of press on this would seem to indicate this is a really big deal. What are your thoughts?
=== chris730 is now known as schmoobuntu
[19:24] <deshack> QUESTION: some days ago we saw the results of a poll made by TechWeekEurope, which shows that Jolla's Sailfish is the most expected Mobile OS, while Ubuntu comes after it. Do you think Sailfish may be a problem for the spread of Ubuntu in mobile?

[19:51] <sebsebseb> QUESTION: I like GNOME Shell, but its also resulted in many differnet interface choices,  Cinnamon and Mate, and I assume Unity to an extent as well really, plus more recently the fall mode is being forked by a distro as well. I think this is a good thing, because it means more choice for the users, but some people call it fragmentation and see it as a bad thing, what do you think about that?
[19:51] <linuxDoug> yes they do.
[19:51] <love4ubuntu> When is Apple going to get their act together and provide itunes for Ubuntu? Wouldn't itunes be a boon to ubuntu adoption and growth?
[19:51] <linuxDoug> ...I'm pretty sure anyway
[19:52] <Paulo_> QUESTION: What's your favorite TV series?
[19:53] <Scrivener> love4ubuntu, Nice way to support a competitor? I don't think they see a big enough Linux crowd that would be using iTunes yet, and Apple will need to be making money, too.
[19:53] <Scrivener> As in they wouldn't do it if they didn't see a money opportunity that justified it.

[19:57] <tuxkalle_> QUESTION: what is your text editor of choise
[19:58] <jaduncan> Scrivener: probably an extra issue of not wanting to make a minor competitor more useful. Windows was the incumbent, so it was worth it.

[19:59] <JoseeAntonioR> sebsebseb: that's me, yes
