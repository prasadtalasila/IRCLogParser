[16:36] <psivaa> cjwatson: reported bug 1098577 for wrong archive location selection for a German language installation. This issue is only during preseeded installations and not during manual installations. I could not do a preseed installation whilst running debug-ubquity but the preseed is attached to the bug.
[16:36] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1098577 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Archive locations are not picked up correctly according to the timezones for preseeded raring desktop installations" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1098577
[16:47] <cjwatson> psivaa: I don't understand why you couldn't do a preseeded installation while running debug-ubiquity.
[16:47] <cjwatson> You might not be able to do it with utah, but you can use more standard mechanisms.
[16:58] <psivaa> cjwatson: i tried with giving a url of the preseed and added automatic-ubiquity and debug-ubiquity in the boot options but still the locale and timezones had to be manually entered
[17:11] <cjwatson> psivaa: I've followed up to the bug.
[17:39] <cjwatson> psivaa: I think I have a patch that will work, but it's in the queue for a local VM slot to test it :-)
[17:40] <cjwatson> psivaa: You are still going to need to modify your preseeding at least for the UTC case.
[17:41] <psivaa> cjwatson: ack thanks v much for the fix. Ill do the modifications for the UTC and it will be US/Eastern that i'll be using for our servers being there
[17:42] <cjwatson> mirror/country=US should do either way, though it won't work until my next upload
[17:43] <psivaa> cjwatson: ack, will test it after that then
[17:50] <plars> xnox: did you ever happen to discover whether it's possible to preseed the oem-config portion of installs?
[17:51] <xnox> plars: no, but doing this now. If it's not possible, I'll try propose a solution on how to do this.
[17:51] <cjwatson> It is kind of partially possible.  It has never worked very well due to a crazy set of conflicting requirements (I'm afraid I forget the exact details).
[17:52] <xnox> thanks for the heads up =)
[17:52] <plars> good to know, thanks
[17:52] <cjwatson> Mostly difficult-to-resolve conflicts between running ubiquity more than once (i.e. quit installer, start again) and oem-config's behaviour.
[17:52] <cjwatson> Though it's years since I last tried so maybe somebody fixed that without my noticing :-)
[17:54] <xnox> cjwatson: do you mind if I merge a small dmraid nmu from debian?
[17:54] <xnox> TIL ping
[17:55] <cjwatson> xnox: Be my guest - I'd rather not be TIL on that :-)
[17:55] <cjwatson> And it was only really for a rebuild
[17:55] <xnox> =))))
[17:55] <xnox> yeah.
[17:56] <cjwatson> The last person who actually did a full merge has been expelled from Ubuntu, and the other person who does lots of work on it doesn't have upload rights AFAIK, so ...
[17:56] <xnox> oh. I did wanted to ask who that was..... as I didn't recognise the name. i guess it doesn't matter.
[17:57] <xnox> top google hit - is obviously phoronix article.
[18:10] <cjwatson> Argh, Unity is so terrible in kvm these days, makes installer work annoying
[18:10] <cjwatson> And when did apport start stealing focus? :-(
[18:24] <infinity> apport's been doing that for quite a while.
[18:25] <infinity> It's painful when you have it eating your machine for half an hour grinding through reports, and you're trying to work on other things.
[18:39] <cjwatson> psivaa: Hah, glad you used US/Eastern as an example, that's one of the awkward special cases ...
