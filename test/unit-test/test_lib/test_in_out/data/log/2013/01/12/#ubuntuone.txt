[20:40] <ali1234> can i share a file in ubuntu one without having it synced onto all of my machines?
[20:41] <ali1234> if i want to publish a file it seems i have to copy it into Ubuntu One folder which is always synced...
[23:54] <dobey> ali1234: it has to be in a folder that is synchronized to ubuntu one; it doesn't have to be in ~/Ubuntu One/ to do that. you could put it in ~/Public Files/ and sync that folder to Ubuntu One, and not choose to sync it down to your other machines
