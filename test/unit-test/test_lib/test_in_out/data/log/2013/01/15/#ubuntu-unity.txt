[13:40] <larsu> conscioususer, hey, I heard you might know the bug number for which bug #1078694 is a duplicate (about disabling the global menu when a modal dialog pops up)
[13:40] <ubot5> bug 1078694 in appmenu-gtk (Ubuntu) "Modal dialog broken on Unity" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1078694
[13:43] <conscioususer> larsu: I originally filed this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-appmenu/+bug/775969 but then was informed that modal dialogs shouldn't inherit parent menus AT ALL, so it was made a duplicate of this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/indicator-appmenu/+bug/674605
[13:43] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 674605 in Application Menu Indicator "duplicate for #775969 Transient window wrongly shows menus for its parent" [Medium,Confirmed]
[13:43] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 674605 in Application Menu Indicator "Transient window wrongly shows menus for its parent" [Medium,Confirmed]
[13:44] <larsu> conscioususer, that's the one. Thank you!
[13:45] <conscioususer> larsu: no prob
[14:07] <didrocks> hey sil2100, how are you?
[14:15] <davidcalle> Hey didrocks, how is the jetlag?
[14:15] <didrocks> davidcalle: well, as supposed to be :) waken up 3 hours ago, and it's 6:15 now :)
[14:16] <davidcalle> didrocks, nice :)
[14:27] <sil2100> didrocks: hello!
[14:27] <sil2100> didrocks: wow, you're up early ;)
[14:27] <didrocks> sil2100: how things are going? :)
[14:28] <didrocks> sil2100: well, it's half past 6 now, but has been waken up at 3:30 :/
[14:28] <didrocks> so yeah, not quite funny, will be tired later on I guess
[14:28] <didrocks> how are things going?
[14:38] <didrocks> sil2100: FYI, run 67 of the indicator unity autopilot tests failed on intel (and only on intel), flacky tests?
[14:38] <didrocks> run 68 running right now
[14:40] <sil2100> didrocks: let me check that
[14:40] <didrocks> thanks :)
[14:41] <didrocks> run 68 worked on intel now
[14:51] <sil2100> Have some VPN problems
[14:52] <sil2100> didrocks: I have to jump out to the store for lunch provisions, but once I'm back I'll try doing what I can ;)
[14:53] <didrocks> sil2100: sure :)

[15:00] <fginther> didrocks, good morning!
[15:00] <didrocks> hey fginther :)
[15:01] <fginther> didrocks, I have some code ready to test the changelog only merges. Can you please ping me next time you have some branches ready to merge?
[15:01] <didrocks> fginther: sure, should be in the next couple of hours
[15:01] <didrocks> fginther: will ping you back!
[15:03] <fginther> didrocks, excellent! just send me one or two of the project names before you push the branch. I'll need to modify the jenkins job before the approved branch exists.
[15:04] <didrocks> sure
[16:20] <didrocks> mmrazik: hey, around?
[16:21] <didrocks> mmrazik: can you have a look at this log: /job/ps-indicators-autopilot-release-testing/label=autopilot-nvidia/69/, it seems that tests stopped to run (may be gtk-recordmydesktop crashed?)
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[16:23] <didrocks> mmrazik: there are utah-jenkins/test_unity/autopilot/collect_crash_data.sh for the crash attached to it, do you mind having a look?
[16:24] <mmrazik> didrocks: looks like an Xorg crash
[16:24] <didrocks> mmrazik: shouldn't it just abort this tests?
[16:24] <mmrazik> didrocks: https://pastebin.canonical.com/82037/
[16:25] <didrocks> mmrazik: and not the whole test suite?
[16:25] <didrocks> being back in 30 minutes
[16:25] <didrocks> but the tests should finish I guess
[16:52] <sil2100> Strange thing, apview stopped working for me
[16:52] <sil2100> ;(
[16:54] <sil2100> Oh, ok, it works now
[16:58] <sil2100> mmrazik: regarding the ps-indicators-autopilot-release-testing job, it seems that the 70th build test has one failure, but the desktop recording is not there
[17:19] <sil2100> didrocks: looking at the faiulre, but hm, it seems to be a single strange failure - it seems more like a regression than an autopilot problem
[17:19] <sil2100> At least from the movie
[17:19] <didrocks> sil2100: the next run didn't trigger it
[17:19] <didrocks> but yet another one showed a failure
[17:19] <didrocks> see run 69 and 70
[17:19] <didrocks> on intel
[17:20] <sil2100> Strangeness, maybe I'll find something that might be causing it
[17:20] <sil2100> Maybe I'll rewrite the test a bit
[17:21] <sil2100> didrocks: on another note - if I have some SRU packages to release to quantal this week, should I ping you about them? Or pester someone else ;p ?
[17:21] <didrocks> sil2100: yeah, I'm afraid that's something which will be needed

[21:38] <trijntje> Hi all, is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/Lenses still up to date? I noticed the code on there is C, while the wikipedia-lens tutorial uses Python
