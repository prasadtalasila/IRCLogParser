[06:48] <mesquka> Hi
[08:03] <Ryan45> Hello
[08:09] <Ryan45> Ubuntu people: Figure out how to sell refurbished Galaxy Nexus's
[08:54] <mesquka> Hi
[08:54] <mesquka> Ryan45: Galexy Nexus's are google and samsung, NOT canonical
[08:57] <Ryan45> lol
[08:58] <Ryan45> hence figure out how to sell them :)
[08:58] <Ryan45> Somewhere out there is a refurbished stock pile :)
[08:59] <mesquka> Ryan45: haha
[09:00] <mesquka> Ryan45: ubuntu phone developers are creating a phone os, not loading phone OS's onto phones for people, that's for manufactures and OEM's
[09:00] <Ryan45> Yes
[09:01] <Ryan45> UP dev's are going to need a pool of test people
[09:01] <Ryan45> A few places are selling refurbished galaxy nexus
[09:06] <Ryan45> You know what would be handy
[09:06] <Ryan45> A google voice dialer client.
[09:06] <Ryan45> You can get the verizon nexus for $189
[09:06] <Ryan45> on ebay refurbished, available in bulk
[09:08] <Ryan45> hmm
[09:08] <Ryan45> https://code.google.com/p/qgvdial/
[09:08] <Ryan45> I might just get a Verizon nexus and use that.
[09:08] <Ryan45> do wifi calling to start
[09:11] <Ryan45> i can get one on ebay for $160 right now
[09:11] <Ryan45> hmm
[09:11] <Ryan45> sooo tempting
[09:11] <Ryan45> I'd prefer a gsm so I can throw a sim card in for straighttalk (usa's only decent no contract carrier)
[09:16] <Ryan45> wow
[09:16] <Ryan45> http://www.cellpex.com/index.php?fuseaction=models.home&brand=Samsung&model=Galaxy+Nexus+I9250&section=1&type=1
[09:16] <Ryan45> I could get 450 of them at $305 each
[09:16] <Ryan45> GSM
[09:31] <Ryan45> Ok, send a message to the guy who recently had 450 of them for sale. I am not sure what he has now, so I asked him if he still had access or would be interested in working to put together a group buy. As soon as that image drops I am sure a number of Ubuntu users are going to be interested in grabbing a GN.
[09:31] <Ryan45> send/sent
[10:05] <WanderingEnder> Ryan45, reminder: Verizon phones are locked. If that phone bill was ever not paid, you've bought a brick, as Verizon will never turn it on again until the original owner pays their full bill with penalties.

[18:57] <mhall119> Ryan45: from what I've been told, only GSM is going to be supported in the released images
[18:57] <mhall119> so don't get a CDMA phone if you want to use it for calls
