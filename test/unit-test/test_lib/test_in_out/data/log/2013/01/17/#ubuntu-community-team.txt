[13:47] <dholbach> czajkowski, nice, I'll check it out
[13:48] <czajkowski> it's a good set
[13:48] <czajkowski> dholbach: can you download peoples sound cloud mixes?
[13:49] <dholbach> sometimes they enable downloads, in other cases I've heard you can use the package 'youtube-dl'
[13:49] <dholbach> so far I like the mix
[13:50] <dholbach> a shame there's no track list
[13:50] <czajkowski> dholbach: let me go poke the DJ
[13:50] <dholbach> :-D
[13:51] <czajkowski> having lunch and listening to that, now to detach from irc bbiab
[13:52] <dholbach> enjoy
[14:26] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: hey, are we having devel hangouts back next week? so I can check the calendar
[14:27] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, yes
[14:28] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: great! :)
[14:28] <dholbach> yes :)
[14:59] <scott-work> happy (belated) birthday dholbach ;)
[15:00] <smartboyhw> dholbach, happy birthday:P
[15:00] <dholbach> thanks scott-work, smartboyhw :)
[15:01] <scott-work> has there been any rumours about UDS-S? if it is going to be in the US i wanted to schedule vacation time with my company
[15:01] <scott-work> i'm also hoping they are still sponsoring flavour leads
[15:01]  * scott-work crosses fingers
[15:01] <smartboyhw> Isn't it in asia? Singapore or HK?:P
[15:02] <smartboyhw> scott-work, clearly dholbach isn't letting out the news...
[15:03] <dholbach> smartboyhw, yeah, because I make all the decisions - that's right :)
[15:03] <dholbach> I'd love to go to Asia if that's what you want to hear :)
[15:03] <smartboyhw> LOL
[15:03] <JoseeAntonioR> nah, make it Peru!
[15:04] <smartboyhw> dholbach, maybe you should make a election for UDS-S:P
[15:05] <scott-work> heh, smartboyhw , i didn't intend that question to go directly to daniel. that was just quirky timing
[15:05] <SergioMeneses> morning
[15:06] <dholbach> smartboyhw, I doubt it works like that
[15:06] <smartboyhw> dholbach, try it for once.
[15:06] <smartboyhw> People will thank you for that
[15:06] <dholbach> "pick your conference location" and you'll get half the people voting for Mauritius the other half for Amsterdam or Las Vegas

[15:08] <JoseeAntonioR> oops, adams went down
[15:10] <smartboyhw> oops......;p
[15:10] <smartboyhw> dholbach, lol
[15:59] <jcastro> hey wait a minute
[15:59] <jcastro> I just noticed
[15:59] <jcastro> mhall119: did we move "Restart" back to the power menu?
[16:00] <cjohnston> we have a power menu?
[16:00] <cjohnston> :-P
[16:00] <mhall119> did we?
[16:01] <mhall119> I'm not at my computer atm
[16:03] <jcastro> it's in my menu on raring
[16:04] <dholbach> yeah, same here
[16:19] <scott-work> jcastro: mhall119 , it is even more confusing when you are working on various flavours because some have a "restary", some don't. others you need to access "restart" via "log out" and i belive on others you have to select "shut down" to get to "restart"
