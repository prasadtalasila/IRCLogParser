[01:28] <G> hads: have you noticed issues with the e1000e/network with yours?
[06:08] <hads> G: Not that I've noticed so far but haven't had it on that long.
[06:13] <G> hads: hmmm okay, certainly an issue with mine, network dies unless pinging another (any other) alive host on the network
[06:13]  * G goes to try something that was mentioned on the Intel site
[18:30] <ibeardslee> morning
[18:34] <chilts> morning
[19:12] <ajmitch> morning
[19:16] <Atamira> morning
[21:55] <olly> morning
[21:57] <hads> G: How quickly does it die?
[22:12] <G> hads: reasonably quickly, basically (and this is how I noticed it) if you PXE boot install, it'll just suddenly stop transferring
[22:13] <G> hads: I tried 12.10 and gave up - because the busy box 'ping' only sends one ping and gives up, but 13.04, and Fedora, equally bad
[22:13] <G> hads: let me find the NUC communities post about it
[22:15] <G> hads: http://communities.intel.com/message/175243#175243 - personally I'm wondering if it's something to do with a particular batch or something
[23:14] <hads> I haven't run Ubuntu on it yet.
[23:16] <hads> G: I've just run it up with OpenELEC on it and have been updating databases etc. for 30 minutes. Playing some music now with no issues.
[23:18] <hads> Looks like you've posted some good info there, hopefully they do something with it.
[23:22] <G> hads: yeah, is yours the same batch?
[23:23] <hads> heh, the noise this box makes is amusing.
[23:24] <G> hads: the carton?
[23:24] <hads> Yeah
[23:24] <G> protip: Don't leave it open in the room
[23:24] <hads> Flat?
[23:25] <hads> Mine is a different batch; CNG62BQ105
[23:25] <G> no, just when you turn the lights on at night, it'll play the sound :)
[23:25] <G> hads: interesting, here is hoping it's not a batch issue
[23:26] <hads> heh
[23:27] <hads> At least if it is a batch issue you can send it back for an exchange.
[23:28] <G> might call Intel up and lodge it formally so it becomes a warranty issue too
