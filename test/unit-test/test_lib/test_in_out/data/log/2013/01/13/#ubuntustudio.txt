[00:12] <bobweaver> Hello there there is a person on the main channel that is having troubles with things showing up in the login menu like Unity 2d is there something in Ubuntu studio that is hindering that by default ?
[00:14] <zequence> bobweaver: nope
[00:15] <bobweaver> huh ubuntu studio uses lightdm ?
[00:15] <bobweaver> or gdm
[00:16] <bobweaver> I think that he is having this same issue
[00:16] <bobweaver> http://askubuntu.com/questions/148070/ubuntu-studio-i-unity-2d-installed-but-i-cant-see-anything
[00:16] <zequence> bobweaver: lightgdm. You can check with: apt-cache show ubuntustudio-desktop
[00:17] <bobweaver> cool
[00:17] <zequence> ubuntustudio-desktop is mostly derived from xubuntu
[00:17] <bobweaver> yeah that is cool so it is xfce DE with a bunch of cool stuff
[00:17] <bobweaver> I also seen at uds that it is on dvd now
[00:18] <zequence> I think the installation ISO for Ubuntu Studio has always been a DVD, because of the amount of packages
[00:19] <bobweaver> cool , Yeah I do not know much about it I am just a qt developer
[00:19] <bobweaver> well qml mainly
[00:19] <zequence> The choice of desktop is not the main priority for Ubuntu Studio, as it's based on multimedia. Of course, the desktop needs to be easy to use for multimedia
[00:20] <bobweaver> that is cool yeah I make my own spin off DE
[00:20] <bobweaver> spin off of Unity 2d
[00:20] <zequence> You were at UDS?
[00:20] <bobweaver> yeah
[00:20] <zequence> Me too. I did the plenary for Ubuntu Studio
[00:21] <bobweaver> I got sponsored for my work in Ubuntu TV
[00:21] <zequence> cool
[00:21] <bobweaver> ahh cool you are the blue shirt dude ?
[00:21] <bobweaver> get excited and make something
[00:21] <bobweaver> or something like that
[00:22] <bobweaver> I was there it was fun I learned alot
[00:22] <zequence> I believe I was wearing a grey sweater
[00:22] <bobweaver> I made video about it
[00:22] <bobweaver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pER9B5Jo5dI
[00:22] <bobweaver> that was openshot
[00:22] <zequence> Yeah, it was inspirational. Nice to meet lots of people there too
[00:23] <bobweaver> here is the spin off that I have been working on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJUFSgaX5E0
[00:24] <bobweaver> can run ontop of xfce I do that for my myth setup
[00:24] <bobweaver> Well I asked the dude that is having troubles to join this channel after reboot if it is still not working
[00:25] <zequence> does unity-2d exist for all releases?
[00:25] <bobweaver> no
[00:26] <bobweaver> libunity and dee and some other libs changed to much
[00:26] <bobweaver> after 12.04
[00:26] <bobweaver> but the Phone is all in qml so I am wondering about all that zequence
[00:27] <whatisubuntustud> hey everyone
[00:27] <bobweaver> hello
[00:28] <whatisubuntustud> can ubuntustudio be used to create dubstep?
[00:29] <zequence> whatisubuntustud: Sure. It's not geared towards any specific type of genres
[00:29] <whatisubuntustud> does it have the ability to automate wobbles?
[00:30] <zequence> Sounds like you're looking for software tools/fx
[00:31] <zequence> I don't know what automated wobbles is, but I'm sure you can find a tool, or a combination of tools to suite your needs
[00:31] <whatisubuntustud> k thanks
[00:31] <zequence> Many sound fx are done with audio wave editors..
[00:31] <zequence> not with automated tools
[00:32] <zequence> or just mixing instruments with fx
[01:16] <bobweaver> So I am installing ubuntustudio to play around with it and test out some stuff. Id there anything that you all are doing that you are focusing on ?
[01:17] <bobweaver> In development that is
[01:41] <computer> Hi. Trying to get Unity 2d working. Tried most things. Is this an issue with Ubuntu Studio?
[01:43] <zequence> computer: no
[01:43] <zequence> computer: Which release?
[01:44] <zequence> bobweaver: Are you interested in helping out, or you're just curious? :)
[01:44] <zequence> bobweaver: I'd say our focus is on making multimedia easy for linux users
[01:44] <bobweaver> hey
[01:44] <computer> 12 Something....I forget....What's the code for terminal to find out?
[01:45] <bobweaver> yeah I was looking at the bugs that are on launchpad
[01:45] <zequence> computer: cat /etc/issue
[01:45] <bobweaver> hi computer  still no unity 2d in the logoin menu ?
[01:45] <computer> Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS \n \l
[01:45] <zequence> computer: Sure you installed it?
[01:46] <computer> No. computer crashed so had to remove gnome shell
[01:46] <zequence> In either way, it's not a problem cause by Ubuntu Studio
[01:47] <bobweaver> computer,  and you can launch unity-2d-shell still just can not see it in lightdm ?
[01:47] <zequence> I've found gnome-shell on 12.04 quite stable myself
[01:47] <bobweaver> +1 zequence
[01:47] <computer> Had to remove gnome shell using recovery mode :(
[01:48] <bobweaver> gezz it all sounds so strange computer
[01:48] <zequence> computer: Why? Cause I don't think removing it would affect your possibilities to get to the login screen
[01:49] <computer> Launch from where? Terminal? comes up with many issues in terminal...Buttons come to desktop then go after a while?
[01:49] <bobweaver> zequence,  I have had him install unity greeter and reinstall unity 2d and lightdm  and still he is not getting options for unity 2d in lightdm
[01:49] <computer> Would not even get to the log in screen so had to remove?
[01:50] <zequence> gnome-shell doesn't initialize until after you login, so it could not stop you from reaching the login screen
[01:50] <zequence> Anyway, i'm a bit busy. bbl :)
[01:50] <bobweaver> me too
[01:51] <computer> strange because after removing it the pc made it to the log in screen?
[01:53] <computer> Shame because ubuntu studio is a great system for running my electric guitar through but graphics slowing things down tooo much??
[01:54] <computer> Ok if your busy right now :)
[01:54] <zequence> computer: I gather you have an older computer with a graphic card that doesn't handle 3D acceleration?
[01:55] <zequence> You didn't like XFCE?
[01:56] <computer> Using Celeron 2.4 with intergrated extreme graphics.
[01:57] <bobweaver> computer,  all yes's  when running /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p
[01:57] <computer> Which works ok with the audio editing programs but graphics slow things down.
[01:57] <computer> I'll have a look.
[01:58] <zequence> computer: I'd recommend either XFCE or LXDE for low end machines
[01:58] <zequence> computer: You could install Lubuntu, and add the ubuntustudio-audio meta
[01:58] <zequence> Add yourself to audio group and install linux-lowlatency
[01:59] <zequence> Voila. You have UBuntu Studio with the LXDE desktop
[01:59] <zequence> Of course, the menu won't be the same (I think)
[02:00] <computer> Support test didn't work? This is a low latency OS. XFCE is the same.
[02:01] <zequence> computer: What is a low latency OS, and XFCE is the same as what?
[02:02] <computer> XFCE runs the same as this shell. Ubuntu studio is a low latency OS.
[02:03] <zequence> Ubuntu Studio is an OS. You get low latency from two things. realtime privilege, and a low latency capable kernel
[02:03] <zequence> computer: I still don't understand what you mean about XFCE. Same as this shell?
[02:04] <computer> It's just the graphics that seem to slow things down? Ubuntu studio has a low latency kernel?
[02:05] <zequence> computer: Ubuntu Studio uses linux-lowlatency by default, but you can install it onto any Ubuntu flavor
[02:05] <computer> On the drop down menu there is a XFCE option but it has the same issues with graphics?
[02:06] <zequence> computer: What do you mean exactly, when you say graphics slow things down? What things? If you mean audio, then I can tell you graphics does not slow audio down
[02:07] <zequence> computer: You should see Ubuntu Studio in the drop down menu. That is XFCE as well. If you find the graphics too heavy, you can turn some FX off (if they are on)
[02:08] <computer> Yes but as an example if using a graphics heavy program it slows things down?
[02:08] <zequence> computer: What things?
[02:08] <zequence> slows what down?
[02:09] <computer> Say having a few open programs? the sound is ok but every thing takes forever to load?
[02:09] <zequence> computer: How much RAM do you have?
[02:09] <zequence> computer: free -m
[02:09] <computer> and programs that use more graphics tend to slow things down more.
[02:10] <zequence> computer: It sounds to me like you have too little RAM, and when the RAM gets used up, the computer becomes very very slow
[02:10] <zequence> Since it starts to put things into SWAP
[02:11] <computer> CPU 32% MEM 19% at moment. Have 1gig of mem.
[02:11] <zequence> 1GB is a bare minimum to have these days. especially with web browsers
[02:11] <zequence> 2GB is recommended
[02:12] <computer> Yes but when looking at monitor when programs are running there doesn't seem to be problem?
[02:12] <zequence> flash and java will take up a lot of CPU
[02:12] <computer> CPU goes to about 87% and memory stays low...Around 20%
[02:13] <zequence> Doesn't matter what desktop you have
[02:14] <computer> So the obvious thing would be to cut back on graphics....Hence using unity2D
[02:15] <zequence> XFCE is a light weight desktop
[02:15] <zequence> Did you see if any FX were on?
[02:15] <computer> Yes
[02:15] <zequence> And if you want really light weight, Lubuntu is the best option
[02:15] <computer> Might have tried Xbuntu but that was worse than studio
[02:16] <zequence> Did you try Lubuntu. It's the lightest of them all
[02:17] <computer> Not sure but I don't think so.
[02:17] <zequence> Try it
[02:20] <computer> I can see me building my own kernel :)
[02:21] <zequence> computer: the kernel won't change your prospect of less heavy graphics
[02:26] <bobweaver> computer,  maybe you would like to try flux or icewm ?
[02:27] <computer> Just seems to me that a lot of people have the same problem with graphics slowing things down? The Linux OS is great until it comes to graphics and having built in ways to cope with graphics? And also seeing as most that use linux will use it on a low spec pc?
[02:28] <zequence> computer: I'm sorry. I don't have the same experience as you with graphics. It was not long ago when I was using a P3 with a very old graphic card with Ubuntu. One needs to understand that old graphic cards won't handle modern graphics
[02:28] <zequence> computer: Especially thing like Youtube (flash content)
[02:29] <zequence> I was just recently using a P4 machine with Lubuntu.
[02:29] <computer> :) Yes I understand this.
[02:30] <zequence> computer: And, I don't think you install Linux just because you have old machine. I use the latest stuff with Linux. For me, there's no such thing as Windows or Mac. Only Linux
[02:30] <zequence> My general experience is that Linux is faster than Windows and Mac
[02:30] <zequence> I installed Debian on  iBook recently
[02:30] <zequence> Faster than OSX
[02:31] <zequence> This was wheezy. the latest Debian. 10 years more modern than the original OSX
[02:31] <zequence> Of course, the graphic card on that iBook is junk
[02:31] <zequence> So, no gnome-shell
[02:32] <computer> Yes but I like the idea of using low cost/spec. An example is the Ubuntu Software Center program....Slows things down.
[02:32] <zequence> computer: Use the terminal. Or synaptic
[02:32] <zequence> I've hardly ever used Software Center. It's slow even on recent machines
[02:33] <zequence> It's slow because it's doing a lot of things which you might not be asking for it to do
[02:33] <computer> I'm not being argumentative. I really like Linux....I just see issues.
[02:34] <zequence> computer: Did you try Windows 7 on that machine?
[02:35] <computer> No. It has Windows XP.
[02:35] <zequence> Windows XP is a stone age distro. Very light. I think that if you try Lubuntu, you will find it comparable
[02:36] <zequence> Still, anything 12.04 is quite modern
[02:37] <computer> I will give it a go and see....I just liked Studio because it's set up for my needs.
[02:37] <zequence> computer: Remember, to get good audio performance, just add yourself to audio group and install linux-lowlatency. That's all you need on any flabor
[02:37] <zequence> flavor*
[02:39] <computer> And even if I got a top spec computer just to get around the graphics it would be cool if that went bang to be able to fall back on to a low spec computer?
[02:40] <computer> Like I said studio works fine......Apart from the graphics for some reason. Anyway thanks for your help.
[02:43] <computer> Bye Bye :)

[04:59] <LaRueGT> is there a linuxable 303 emulator out there somewhere?
[05:02] <LaRueGT> nekobee, found it
[05:02] <LaRueGT> so many plugins hidden in these menus
[05:55] <janusleeb> Heyas. Anyone up?
[05:57] <janusleeb> Submariner, are you a bubblehead?
[05:57] <holstein> ask and we'll see
[05:58] <janusleeb> lol, kthx. I'm just installing US for the first time, and was just wondering what your impressions were
[05:58] <holstein> janusleeb: try it live.. and you can see for yourself
[05:59] <janusleeb> nah, i'm doing an install... haven't used M$ winblows since 2K was up-to-date.
[06:00] <janusleeb> nah, i'm doing an install... haven't used M$ winblows since 2K was up-to-date. MacBook Pro that broke a while back, and I finally was able to get a new laptop from system76.
[06:00] <holstein> janusleeb: windows?
[06:00] <janusleeb> I had to use an old P4 Desktop in the interim. wasn't too bad runing slackware, but I couldn't really do much other than homework and browse teh interwebz
[06:01] <janusleeb> yes, winblows. I have no respect for the company, so I avoid using it as much as possible.
[06:02] <janusleeb> oh, time to reboot. hope it all goes well. have a good night guys
[06:02] <holstein> sure.. just avoid refering to is as such in the official channels
[06:02] <janusleeb> kk
[06:02] <holstein> we have folks who use it, and its unecessary and not productive or constructive
[06:03] <holstein> i dont use it either... nor main ubuntu for that matter.. but its just software
[11:57] <zlatko> I think I have trouble with PA Jack Sink. Yesterday Len helped me with Jack & PA settings, but this morning after a restart, Jack Sink acts weird.
[12:00] <zlatko> e.g. in Jack - Connections shows 8 channels (yesterday when all worked I had just 2 (stereo) channels...
[12:18] <zequence> zlatko: Depending on what application you use with pulse, and what the track is you are playing, you may get more than stereo. 5.1, 7.1, 8.1, etc
[12:23] <zlatko> zequence: thank you. But I think yesterday I had just stereo and everything worked
[12:25] <zlatko> Can I start QJackCtl now and tell you what I am getting?
[12:29] <zequence> zlatko: It's normal to get more than stereo, if the music + application you use has more than stereo
[12:31] <zlatko> Ok. I'm now in Volume Control window. In Playback tab I'm listening an mp3 file and it works through UX1 Analog Stereo [my USB sound card].
[12:32] <zlatko> Then when I select Jack Sink from the dropdown on the right side - it gets silent...
[12:33] <zequence> zlatko: Sounds like jack is not using your usb card, but your builtin vard
[12:33] <zequence> card*
[12:33] <zlatko> Capture 1&2 are linked w PAjack source & PA Jack Sink is linked with 8 playbacks on system
[12:34] <zequence> zlatko: Sounds like you have 7.1 on your builtin card
[12:34] <zequence> zlatko: Each time you reboot, the order for the cards may change
[12:35] <zequence> zlatko: What's the output from: cat /proc/asound/cards
[12:35] <zlatko> you were right!
[12:35] <zlatko> I checked in Setup
[12:35] <zlatko> and my hw:0 is now my internal card.
[12:35] <zlatko> while hw:1 is the card I wanna use!
[12:36] <zlatko> let me restart Jack...
[12:36] <zequence> zlatko: If you want jack to always use your usb card, you can write the name of it in the "interface" section
[12:36] <zequence> mine reads "hw:M66"
[12:36] <zequence> This is my output from: cat /proc/asound/cards
[12:36] <zequence>  0 [SB             ]: HDA-Intel - HDA ATI SB
[12:36] <zequence>                       HDA ATI SB at 0xfe300000 irq 16
[12:36] <zequence>  1 [NVidia         ]: HDA-Intel - HDA NVidia
[12:36] <zequence>                       HDA NVidia at 0xfe080000 irq 24
[12:36] <zequence>  2 [M66            ]: ICE1712 - M Audio Delta 66
[12:36] <zequence>                       M Audio Delta 66 at 0xd040, irq 21
[12:37] <zequence> As you see, hw:2 is called "M66"
[12:37] <zequence> So, I just replace 2 with M66.
[12:37] <zequence> This way, jack will always start M66, no matter in which order it is
[12:37] <zlatko> and my output is:
[12:37] <zlatko> 0 [Intel          ]: HDA-Intel - HDA Intel
[12:37] <zlatko>                       HDA Intel at 0xe5100000 irq 44
[12:37] <zlatko>  1 [PODStudioUX1   ]: line6usb - POD Studio UX1
[12:37] <zlatko>                       Line6 POD Studio UX1 at USB 6-1:1.0
[12:38] <zequence> zlatko: So, in "interface", make it read "hw:PODStudioUX1"
[12:38] <zlatko> sorry: where is the interface thing?
[12:39] <zequence> zlatko: Qjackctl -> Setup -> Interface
[12:39] <zequence> Where you select the audio device
[12:39] <zlatko> oh I see. Well its grayed in my case...
[12:40] <zlatko> I cannot change anything there...
[12:40] <zequence> zlatko: I guess you set input and output separately? Why?
[12:41] <zequence> If you were not having problems, set input and output to "default"
[12:41] <zlatko> Yesterday, chatting w Len we setup that way...
[12:41] <zlatko> Now I changed I/O to default and Interface is enabled again
[12:42] <zlatko> now when I select my PODStudioUX1 in interface it changes to hw:1
[12:43] <zequence> zlatko: Write manually "hw:PODStudioUX1"
[12:43] <zlatko> and not hw:PODStudioUX1
[12:43] <zlatko> OK
[12:43] <zequence> don't forget the "hw" part of the name
[12:44] <zequence> zlatko: Make sure nothing is playing through the usb device before you start jack
[12:44] <zequence> I'm getting some food. Good luck
[12:45] <zlatko> OK later...
[16:04] <studio-user874> test
[16:04] <len-1304> studio-user874, works
[16:05] <studio-user874> i`m not wery well speak english :(
[16:07] <studio-user874> I 3hour install Ubuntu Studio 12.10- its normal?
[16:07] <len-1304> I haven't ever measured it
[16:07] <len-1304> I just start it and walk away.
[16:08] <len-1304> I depends on the machine it is installed on and network speed.
[16:09] <len-1304> An install with no network connected is faster. I sometimes use that when testing an ISO
[16:11] <studio-user874> Iso - normal, i choose download update, it`s mistake?
[16:12] <len-1304> Just takes longer, you would update after install anyway.
[16:12] <studio-user874> ok
[16:12] <len-1304> There is a new kernel in there which takes some time to download For example.
[16:13] <studio-user874> well be start away
[17:41] <lucas_> how can I convert monophonic audio (singing, whistling, spanish guitar) to midi?
[17:43] <lucas_> (could be poliphonic too, of course -- but monophonic would be enough)
[17:48] <JanusLi> hey all
[17:48] <lucas_> I'm using 12.04
[17:49] <lucas_> I can also use 12.10 in dvd
[17:50] <len-1304> lucas_, zequence made up a PD script to do that. If you wait on line long enough till he is around, he would probably share it with you
[17:50] <JanusLi> lucas: what are you trying to do?
[17:50] <len-1304> Or you could go through the IRC logs for this channel and see if it is still in the drop box
[17:51] <lucas_> great, thanks! would i have to tell him or does this get logged so he'll just see it? I wouldn't want to spam the others.
[17:51] <len-1304> He posted it just a few days ago
[17:51] <lucas_> ah, the logs - will do that, thanks.
[17:51] <JanusLi> i'm okay with linux, though i haven't been able to mess around with much of the AV side of it yet. just installed US12.10 yesterday
[17:54] <lucas_> JanusLi, I'm trying to input my own music as midi. I'm much better at guitar than at keyboard, but still not good enough so I'll have to correct. Then add second voices, cut and paste, etc.
[17:56] <JanusLi> ah, okay. GL... I haven't touched MIDI since around 2002. But I do have a Strat MIDI pickup I'd be willing to sell you, lol.
[17:57] <JanusLi> what MIDI recorder/sequencer are you using?
[17:58] <lucas_> no idea about that yet. once i can input my guitar monophonic melodies, i'll find out.
[18:03] <JanusLi> gotcha. I was using OSX since 2005-2006, so I've been on ProTools & Reason for stuff like that, but my MBP broke awhile back, and stuck me with an old P$ Desktop. It ran slackware fairly well, but I just got a new laptop, and I've really been wanting to seee what an open-source studio can do. I'm curious what the more experienced users in here think of the nix apps, and wondering if there's anything I need to get/tweak right off the bat with a fresh US
[18:03] <JanusLi> 12.10 install.
[18:04] <JanusLi> lucas_: what hardware do you have interfacing with your machine?
[18:05] <holstein> lucas_: professional stand-alone unitasking appliances designed to do that, dont do it all that well
[18:07] <JanusLi> what, like an M_Audio something?
[18:07] <holstein> JanusLi: kind of.. though no studio i know of uses anything from maudio
[18:08] <JanusLi> or something like a DigiDesign IO
[18:08] <holstein> i think maudio is a good value brand though
[18:08] <holstein> rackarrack has midi out
[18:08] <JanusLi> lol, inorite. But I live in Houston, and I've had guys in GC suggest some of the most ghetto-rigged stuff you've probably ever heard of
[18:09] <holstein> JanusLi: its probably the best they have found.. its not trivial, and nothing does it perfectly
[18:09] <holstein> depends so much on the source
[18:09] <holstein> JanusLi: what instrument?
[18:09] <JanusLi> MAudio is good if you're in HS or college, or that poor, and you're just doing something by yourself for fun.
[18:09] <holstein> some intruments have specific ways of dealing with midi translation
[18:09] <holstein> JanusLi: "good" is a matter of opinion
[18:10] <holstein> i wont argue maudio is a good value.. and we can leave it at that.. i own maudio gear
[18:11] <JanusLi> hey, i'm not knocking it at all, please forgive me if I sounded like it. MAudio is what it is.
[18:11] <JanusLi> I've got an MAudio interface lying around somewhere.
[18:11] <lucas_> JanusLi: ua1ex and ua25ex
[18:11] <holstein> to be clear, im knocking it.. but im also sugesting you wont install a piece of software that will get what you want done flawlessly
[18:12] <JanusLi> That's absolutely correct.
[18:12] <holstein> what lucas_ wants.. the translation to midi
[18:12] <JanusLi> so an analogue to midi translation?
[18:12] <holstein> but, there are instrument specific solutions that would work great
[18:12] <holstein> yup...
[18:13] <lucas_> i've been able to record a few audio tracks from guitar into ardour through jack in 12.04
[18:13] <lucas_> yes
[18:13] <lucas_> and it doesn't have to be real time -- i can create an audio file and then convert to midi later
[18:14] <holstein> lucas_: i would expect mixed results
[18:14] <JanusLi> I know it's possible, but that's about it. As an engineer, my suggestion would usually be to just record a direct MIDI track, but that's cause it would pad my bill, and maybe get someone else around the studio paid, too.
[18:14] <holstein> lucas_: someone came here looking, and found something for that, i forget what it was, but they didnt report as to if it worked or not
[18:15] <holstein> lucas_: rakarrack has midi out
[18:15] <lucas_> will try rakarrack
[18:15] <JanusLi> lol, if they came looking, and didn't come back, then it probablby either worked very well, or was so bad they came up with a different idea
[18:16] <JanusLi> rakarrak is similar to a line6 virtual rig, if I remember right
[18:16] <holstein> lucas_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5852102/software-to-convert-audio-to-midi http://sox.sourceforge.net/ http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2009/05/sound-exchange-sox-15-examples-to-manipulate-audio-files/
[18:17] <holstein> lucas_: you can also ask in #opensourcemusicians
[18:19] <lucas_> Thanks, holstein  I had seen sox (I don't think it works). I looks like either a trivial problem or a hard problem.
[18:19] <holstein> lucas_: i dont think it works either.. its quite challenging to convert audio to midi properly
[18:19] <holstein> lucas_: what instrument?
[18:20] <lucas_> holstein, thing is, a few weeks ago i downloaded an app for my android phone, and it _kinda_ converted a whistle into midi
[18:20] <JanusLi> lucas_: what are you trying to ultimately do with the MIDI file?
[18:20] <lucas_> guitar
[18:20] <JanusLi> Specifically, why are you trying to take a live track to a MIDI one?
[18:21] <lucas_> JanusLi, I want to, erm, compose. You know, copy-paste-modify. Slowly move things around.
[18:21] <holstein> doenst have to be live
[18:21] <lucas_> doesn't have to be live, correct
[18:21] <holstein> http://www.musiciansfriend.com/guitars/you-rock-guitar-yrg-1000-midi-controller-electric-guitar
[18:21] <holstein> lucas_: ^^ something like that might be cheap enough to try, and would allow you to enter notes as a guitar player
[18:22] <lucas_> hah, holstein, i have a yrg but my fingering doesn't work too well
[18:22] <JanusLi> I meant live as in using an analog recording rather than a sequenced track
[18:22] <lucas_> will have to try the yrg again
[18:22] <holstein> lucas_: *anything* in the realm is going to be a compromise
[18:23] <lucas_> JanusLi, I can't create a sequenced track to start with, that's why! I can't play keyboards well enough at all.
[18:23] <holstein> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_synthesizer the roland GK
[18:23] <holstein> lucas_: you dont have to play it in realtime
[18:23] <holstein> you can use a piano roll editor...
[18:24] <holstein> gotta run... cheers!
[18:24] <JanusLi> lol, do you have one? I've got a start MIDI pickup from ~2003 if you'd wanna figure something out to get it to you. would require two screws about .5 cm outside the 'E/e" strings to be mounted, and the box fits under your strap button w/ some felt to pad the surface
[18:25] <lucas_> good find, that guitar synthesizer wikipage holstein thanks!
[18:25] <lucas_> yes, that's my idea: yse a piano roll editor -- once i have something to edit
=== JanusLi is now known as janusli
[19:13] <lucas_> hi zequence_ . len-1304 said you had written a PD script to convert monophonic audio (singing, whistling, spanish guitar) to midi. I've searched the irclogs but can't find it. Help?
[19:25] <lucas_> len-1304, zequence_ http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/01/06/%23ubuntustudio.html has the .pd file - will try that soon! and rakarrack -- thanks len-1304 & holstein !!! this kind of help should be flatr.com'able
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[20:30] <MoL0ToV> hi to all! howto record all the sounds reproduced by the sound card?
[22:13] <LaRueGT> is there a simple host for native vst's without having to fire up a full featured DAW?
[22:38] <zequence> LaRueGT: Checkw with falktx at #kxstudio. I think if anyone should know, he would
[22:39] <zequence> LaRueGT: Or at #opensourcemusicians
[22:40] <LaRueGT> worth a try, it'd be a real handy thing to have
