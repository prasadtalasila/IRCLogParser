[03:10] <bkerensa> slangasek: I would be more than happy to volunteer for a DebConf and wrangle some sponsors in
[04:07] <Capneon> hi
[06:09] <slangasek> bkerensa: whoo :)
[07:08] <blkperl> slangasek: this error is strange
[07:08] <blkperl> dpkg-genchanges: error: cannot read ../collectd_5.1.0-3ubuntu1.dsc: No such file or directory
[07:08] <blkperl> what does it mean?
[07:10] <blkperl> dpkg-genchanges: error: cannot read ../collectd_5.1.0-3ubuntu1.dsc: No such file or directory
[07:38] <blkperl> slangasek: wait it worked...
[07:38] <blkperl> slangasek: is dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc the correct command?
[07:43]  * kees prefers debuild (same args)
[07:48] <blkperl> kees: so I'm really confused now, it built once and now doesn't build anymore
[07:55] <blkperl> so I think its this stupid perl linkage patch...
[07:55] <blkperl> I should have taken notes when I did this with slangasek
=== dustbusterbot is now known as dustwork
[17:19] <bkerensa> slangasek: also the event I was planning last year is finally culminating can I still count you in as a speaker?
[17:19] <bkerensa> :)
[17:19] <bkerensa> planning for June 22nd
[17:24] <slangasek> bkerensa: you're going to have to remind me what event this is you're talking about :)
[17:25] <kees> blkperl: I'm not sure I follow. does it error out the second time? what does it say?
[17:27] <bkerensa> slangasek: https://etherpad.mozilla.org/iJWAWp3jP2 <-- that one
[17:27] <bkerensa> kees:  would also love for you to give a talk :)
[17:28] <bkerensa> slangasek: its been aptly named the Open Source Leadership Summit where this year it will be a full one day event as a test run and if its a hit then each year it will be a two day summit
[17:28] <bkerensa> its free and open to the public and focused just on open source talks
[17:29] <slangasek> huh, ok
[17:29] <slangasek> I'm not sure I heard about this at all (or maybe I assumed you were talking about the Community Leadership Summit)
[17:29] <slangasek> looks interesting
[17:30] <slangasek> Wearable Computers> ooh, can you get the Keyglove guy to come?
[17:30] <bkerensa> ;p slangasek you will notice you added your name at the bottom
[17:30] <bkerensa> :)
[17:30] <bkerensa> Keyglove guy?
[17:30] <slangasek> I'm not sure it's true that *I* added my name ;)
[17:31] <slangasek> oh, this is the one that had the comment window with people trolling about Ubuntu
[17:31] <slangasek> right, now I remember
[17:31] <slangasek> so yeah, I can do an Intro to Debian Packaging - or something else too, if there's another topic that would be interesting
[17:31] <bkerensa> great
[17:55] <kees> bkerensa: what did you have in mind from me? It looks like "intro" style talks? I have a slide deck for "FLOSS security programming best practices" I've given a few times at OSU
[17:55] <kees> I also have a deck from bsides on chrome os security.
[18:00] <bkerensa> kees: FLOSS security programming would be great :)
[18:01] <bkerensa> kees: and I can ensure you and slangasek both have appropriate food stuffs
[18:04] <slangasek> frosted voodoo donuts shaped like cavemen? ;)
[18:20] <bkerensa> :)
[19:37] <bkerensa> slangasek: do you have a short bio/head shot somewhere?
[19:37] <bkerensa> kees: you?
[19:46] <kees> bkerensa: http://outflux.net/bio.txt
[19:46] <kees> bkerensa: I've added myself to the potential speaker list on the etherpad too
[19:50] <bkerensa> kees: You haz headshot? :)
[19:53]  * kees avoids your question
[19:53] <bkerensa> kees: ok then :)
[19:53] <kees> I'm using a Chrome logo for drupalcon :)
[19:53] <bkerensa> kees: I will find a black default avatar
[19:53] <kees> cool. that or http://outflux.net/laughing_man_elmex.png
[22:02] <slangasek> bkerensa: I suppose it would make sense for me to cook something like that up and make it permanently available, wouldn't it
