[15:15] <mhall119> fun working?
[15:20] <jcastro> "I shall celebrate my birthday by working on this API!"
[15:21] <aquarius> surprisingly close to the truth :)
[15:21] <aquarius> fun... that's one word for it, I suppose :)

[16:02] <balloons> where is it?
[16:32] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, hangouts are going to be on ubuntuonair right?
[16:32] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: correct
[16:32] <dholbach> sweet
[16:32] <JoseeAntonioR> it's already linked to #ubuntu-classroom-chat instead
[16:34] <dholbach> thanks
[16:57] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: classbot is being messy, ended coolbhavi's session abruptly
[16:57] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, can somebody look into this?
[16:57] <dholbach> do we have somebody from the irc team?
[16:57] <JoseeAntonioR> I think nigelb or lyz
[16:57] <nigelb> what's wrong?
[16:58] <JoseeAntonioR> classbot just stopped working
[16:58] <dholbach> #ubuntu-classroom / #ubuntu-classroom-chat - classbot just ended a session
[16:58] <nigelb> gimme a sec. let me step out of this meeting.
[16:58] <JoseeAntonioR> I can just moderate the channel and do the thing on-air, no need for classbot (I can pick questions manually)
[16:58] <pleia2> what's the trouble with classbot?
[16:59] <nigelb> ah, pleia2 is here :)
[16:59] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, I need to go live, so I'll just go with it
[16:59] <nigelb> pleia2: what's the IP for classbot? I don't seem to have the right one.
[16:59] <dholbach> rrnwexec, got time? :)
[16:59] <rrnwexec> yup. logging in now
[16:59] <pleia2> nigelb: the one in -classroom seems fine, so I think I need to know which one is the problem
[17:00] <JoseeAntonioR> looks like classbot's it's 10mins behind
[17:00] <JoseeAntonioR> s/classbot's it's/classbot's
[17:00] <pleia2> hm, let me check the calendar
[17:01] <JoseeAntonioR> fixed now
[17:01] <pleia2> ok
[17:02] <JoseeAntonioR> he just got crazy
[17:03] <pleia2> who fixed it?
[17:04] <pleia2> (I'd like to know what happened at least)
[17:04] <JoseeAntonioR> no idea, itself?
[17:04] <pleia2> ok
[17:19] <jono_> dholbach, can we go now?
[17:19] <dholbach> jono_, still in the call with Randall

[18:17] <jono_> AlanBell, you seem to have some background hum, might want to mute when not speaking
[18:17] <technoviking> that is better, ugh...
[18:18] <technoviking> jcastro: will try to help the forums folks ASAP
[18:19] <jcastro> nod

[20:40] <AlanBell> thoughts comments and typos plz
[20:40] <JoseeAntonioR> balloons: did you define your session's time?
[20:40] <balloons> working on it right now
[20:41] <balloons> the trouble is, we can't do it live on friday
[20:41] <balloons> timezone doesn't work
[20:41] <balloons> is it possible for us to pre-record it?
[20:42] <JoseeAntonioR> erm, sure
[20:43] <JoseeAntonioR> balloons: what we can do is, record it on air (doesn't matter if we've got audience or not), and then it'll get auto-uploaded to youtube
[20:43] <JoseeAntonioR> we can do that now if you like
[20:43] <balloons> ok, well, not now
[20:44] <balloons> but it would be like hmm.. tomorrow sometime
[20:44] <balloons> probably around this time
[20:44] <balloons> I guess let's do that.. one sec I'll confirm a time
[20:44] <JoseeAntonioR> sure
[20:44]  * JoseeAntonioR would need to check too
[20:55] <mhall119> AlanBell: ping
[21:01] <AlanBell> hi mhall119
[21:02] <mhall119> AlanBell: posting a comment to your blog
[21:03] <mhall119> which might be getting hammered atm, since it's slow
[21:03] <mhall119> but basically just clarifying that you can opt out of the feedback, but only in combination with opting out of the smart-scopes all together
[21:03] <jcastro> you need a CDN son!
[21:03] <AlanBell> hmm, that shouldn't be slow
[21:03] <mhall119> the way you worded it, it could be read that opting-out is imposssible
[21:04] <AlanBell> ah, OK
[21:04] <AlanBell> I think I worded it more accurately further down
[21:04] <AlanBell> but yeah, in the bullet point it needs a caveat
[21:04] <mhall119> you did, but then people would have to read all the way down before ranting about it
[21:05] <mhall119> I love that you told people to read the spec twice
[21:05] <jcastro> read all the way down? Let's not get crazy
[21:05] <AlanBell> dammit, what is up with that server
[21:05] <mhall119> ah, your website just timed out with "Error establishing a database connection"
[21:05] <AlanBell> normally it stands up to a slashdotting with no problem
[21:06] <AlanBell> will give it a poke
[21:07] <mhall119> AlanBell: you broke G+ too
[21:07] <mhall119> "There was an error. Please try again later."
[21:07] <AlanBell> ooh, the server is out of memory
[21:08] <popey> #blamewordpress
[21:08] <popey> or php
[21:08] <popey> or apache
[21:08] <popey> or all of them
[21:08]  * AlanBell kills it with fire
[21:08] <AlanBell> fixed now
[21:08] <mhall119> apacphpress?
[21:11]  * AlanBell updates the article for accuracy
[21:13] <AlanBell> 57 views so far, that isn't much, certainly not enough to knock that server over, it had 885 article views today in total
[21:14] <jcastro> popey: hey alan
[21:14] <jcastro> alan, al, alan, alan, alan.
[21:14] <AlanBell> ;)
[21:14] <jcastro> so I've been running pure btrfs for about 3 weeks now
[21:15] <jcastro> the dpkg speed thing isn't an issue anymore for me in raring with it's stock kernel
[21:18] <popey> niiice
[21:18] <popey> what dpkg speed thing?
[21:19] <popey> has it been a problem previously?
[21:21] <jcastro> yes
[21:21] <jcastro> dpkg fsyncs a ton
[21:22] <jcastro> so using btrfs as a root filesystem took like over an hour to install, etc.
[21:24] <popey> hah
[21:27] <popey> you did a clean install?
[22:03] <jcastro> yeah I was rebuilding the machine anyway
