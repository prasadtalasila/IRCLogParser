[15:19] <TommyT> (looking through the logs) I would like to be the first to wish everyone a happy new year!
[15:20] <TommyT> ... and a merry Christmas, Happy Thanksgiving, Halloween, Fourth of July, Memorial Day....
[15:20] <TommyT> (for 2012)
[15:21] <TommyT> Things have been slow around here.
[16:24] <r2d2rogers> yes, yes they have, same as the channel I lurk in for Lousiana
[16:34] <TommyT> Tony (Kwadroke) dropped the carlug.org domain (and associated mailing lists) for lack of interest, too. Not sure what the future holds for local interest.
[16:35] <TommyT> We have the ubuntu-us-ar irc (here) and the discussion forum.
[16:36] <TommyT> I took on the management of the loco (ubuntu-us-ar) when I noticed some rot in the settings. But I haven't done much. I'm not sure if I've even put us back in "North America" yet.
[16:38] <r2d2rogers> yeah, I had comflicts of time when I used to be contact for us-la, but the people who took it over dropped out also
