[00:10] <wrst> greetings  afew hours late chris4585
[00:12] <chris4585> sup wrst
[00:12] <wrst> not much chris4585, been playing around with freenas
[00:15] <chris4585> cool
[00:23] <wrst> pretty cool setup
[00:24] <wrst> i'm finding that my hardware is a little not up for the task, not bad but to get the full goodness
[00:24] <wrst> especially out of ZFS
[00:31] <chris4585> I would do something like that but I need a few hard drives first
[00:32] <wrst> had a couple spares and an external so have them hooked up
[00:32] <wrst> cool thing is you can add more fairly easily it seems
[00:33] <wrst> of course i suppose raid would be in order and what not too
[00:33] <wrst> with zfs not positive if raid would even be necessary
[00:34] <wrst> and i see it is reccomended not to use hardware raid with zfs
[00:44] <chris4585> wrst, neat
[00:44] <wrst> yeah something else for me to tinker with :)
[00:44] <wrst> just what i need
[00:48] <chris4585> lol
[00:49] <chris4585> I really need an extra hard drive :/
[00:56] <wrst> chris4585: i really don't need the storage i have now
[01:09] <chris4585> its cool
[01:10] <chris4585> what I think I'm going to do is eventually buy a 250gb hdd, and a 1tb hdd, the 250 for a dedicated windows, and 1tb for storage
[01:10] <chris4585> then take this 500gb and give it to my secondary computer
[01:14] <wrst> dedicated windows.... :\
[01:16] <chris4585> lol
[01:16] <chris4585> yes because I don't really like the idea of windows sharing a hard drive with linux
[01:18] <wrst> i have a windows partition on this laptop but its not on the main hard drive and I boot it up once every 2 months to update :)
[01:18] <wrst> actually been more like 3 i suppose it was before thanksgiving
[01:18] <chris4585> well I game sometimes
[01:19] <wrst> that makes a difference
[01:20] <chris4585> its rather annoying though everytime I boot it up I have updates
[01:20] <chris4585> like ridiculous amount of windows updates
[01:21] <wrst> yes and windows updates don't just work in the background reboot reboot reboot
[01:27] <chris4585> yep
[01:27] <chris4585> annoying when it just reboots in the middle of a game
[01:27] <wrst> yep
[01:28] <wrst> just occured to me, I'm running Arch on the desktop, Ubuntu on one server, FreeNAS for storage, and Debian on another server, I have operating system diversity
[01:31] <chris4585> lol
[01:31] <chris4585> I have manjaro and windows
[01:33] <wrst> my wife has osx, then we have android and ios
[01:33] <wrst> i do have a windows vm that i use on rare occasion but it doesn't count
[02:06] <wrst> hmm freenas does a time machine backup that works perfect also
[02:41] <chris4585> nice
[02:42] <wrst> yeah its a preset in the apple share
[14:35] <average_guy> Bitlbee is running, all of my accounts are set up fine but it won't stay connected. It keeps dropping and over in the "status" window I get- ERROR Closing link: Pink Timeout: 360 seconds. Can anyone suggest what might be causing this?
[19:33] <average_guy> YES! Finally got bitlbee working correctly
[19:33] <average_guy> this has almost givin mr the courage to attempt mutt configuration
[23:01] <cyberanger> average_guy: Sweet
