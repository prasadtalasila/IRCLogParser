[21:03] <pitti> hm, did I miss an email to tb@, or is that IRC discussion matter?
[21:03] <stgraber> soren: you mentioned this item in your meeting reminder but I don't see it on the wiki or the ML :)
[21:04] <stgraber> pitti: good, it's not just me who's missing an e-mail ;)
[21:04] <soren> stgraber: How do you not see in on the wiki? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoardAgenda?action=diff&rev1=473&rev2=474
[21:04] <cjwatson> but it's been removed ...
[21:04] <cjwatson> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TechnicalBoardAgenda?action=diff&rev2=474&rev1=473
[21:04] <soren> I  just pinged Andres in #ubuntu-server.
[21:04] <cjwatson> (er, that URL is effectively the same as yours)
[21:05] <soren> Er..
[21:05] <stgraber> right, was removed a few hours ago by Andres, probably because of today being a public holiday where he lives
[21:05] <soren> Hm, ok.
[21:05] <stgraber> alright, moving on then :)
[21:05] <soren> Sorry about the confusion. :)
[21:05] <soren> It really was there when I sent out that e-mail :)
[21:05] <stgraber> not your fault, your e-mail was right when you sent it, it's just my fault for not thinking of digging into wiki history ;)
[21:05] <stgraber> #topic Scan the mailing list archive for anything we missed (standing item)

[21:06] <stgraber> Looks like we took care of everything by e-mail and don't have anything to discuss here
[21:06] <cjwatson> either we rock or are very boring
[21:06] <stgraber> I prefer to think the former ;)

[21:07] <kees> apologies for my lateness. here now
[21:07] <stgraber> so, who's next?
[21:07] <kees> I haven't run one in a while.
[21:07] <soren> I forget, do we go by name or irc nick?
[21:08] <kees> I think it's been by name.
[21:08] <stgraber> I think I'm last by both firstname and irc nick and Colin is first in both cases, so I guess it's cjwatson
[21:08] <pitti> traditionally by order on https://launchpad.net/~techboard/+members I think
[21:08] <cjwatson> fine by me
