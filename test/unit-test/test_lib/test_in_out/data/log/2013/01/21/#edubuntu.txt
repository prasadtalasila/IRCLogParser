[01:11] <highvoltage> stgraber: something seems wrong with the outgoing emails for deployments, I haven't received any notifications in a while
[01:11] <highvoltage> stgraber: and there are a lot of unconfirmed ones in the web ui
[01:11] <stgraber> highvoltage: hmm, I'll have to check. My guess is that Canonical fixed the firewall weirdness I was using :)
[01:13] <highvoltage> heh

[16:48] <joohoo340> Hello is any one out there?
[16:49] <joohoo340> hello?
[16:49] <alkisg> !ask
[16:49] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience

[16:49] <ubottu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[16:53] <joohoo340> ok I am getting my church up and running with some computer systems and I am trying to make use of the systems that they have (very old). I was wondering if edubuntu was mature/reliable enough to provide some samba shares, dhcp and ltsp all on one machine that has non-server hardware?
[16:59] <highvoltage> joohoo340: edubuntu is basically ubuntu with different installer options and packages, so it's good. I'd recommend going with the LTS (Long Term Support) version though, that's 12.04
[17:00] <highvoltage> one day I'll have the right combination of time/patience/motivation and spend some time with samba and put together some nice docs for Edubuntu users. it's *so* overdue.
[17:01] <joohoo340> yes I was looking at edubuntu because of the server like features ltsp which imo is the harder thing to get setup, and you have a decent gui to do the rest of the stuff
[17:02] <highvoltage> joohoo340: great. there's currently work going into edubuntu to set up samba like that too, it's targeted for a stable release by 14.04. can't wait :)
[17:03] <highvoltage> it will even have a nice web UI: https://plus.google.com/104492301562638456962/posts/gk4DjdSxWWb
[17:05] <joohoo340> that does look really nice. I look forward to being able to use that in the future. I guess I just need to baby sit the system until I can find a stable hands off way to supervise this who thing
[17:06] <joohoo340> thanks for the help and a glimmer of the future.
[17:10] <highvoltage> you're welcome, if you have any tips/feedback to share, please do so
