[02:21] <lifu> Hi, do you know how to apply this patch to ubuntu gnome?
[02:21] <lifu> http://git.gnome.org/browse/mutter/commit/?id=2a2ac52726bcb801cfa1466cb590ef2067555aff
[02:22] <TheLordOfTime> patch it into GNOME, and then recompile
[02:26] <lifu> @TheLordOfTime is there a website that have a detailed version?
[02:26] <lifu> on how to do this?
[02:26] <TheLordOfTime> not really, at least not afaik
[04:42] <darkxst> jbicha, I should be good to help out with packaging 3.7.5 next week.
[05:06] <jbicha> darkxst: cool, maybe we'll get a few minor 3.7.5 pieces into raring (I'm thinking gnome-games, gnome-icon-theme, and similar)
[05:11] <darkxst> ok,I have been meaning to test js188/gjs with 3.6.2, but I might just wait until beta now
[05:13] <darkxst> i.e. 3.7.90
[05:25] <jbicha> darkxst: pay attention to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule after Feature Freeze you'll have to get permission from the Release Team
[05:26] <jbicha> yeah 3.7.90 is supposedly api freeze and it should be enough time before featurefreeze
[05:30] <darkxst> jbicha, ok, I am working with walters to hopefully get a snapshot of js188 (and gjs port) landed before gnome freeze
[05:31] <darkxst> (so it gets in in-time for 3.8)
[05:31] <darkxst> although I don't suppose the other rdepends are going to be ported by then
[05:32] <darkxst> polkit is done (although ubuntu doesnt have that version yet)
[05:32] <darkxst> couchdb looks easy enough
[05:32] <darkxst> the others will be a bit more involved
[05:32] <darkxst> 0ad guys actually from to go straight to FF18
[05:33] <darkxst> s/from/want/
[05:34] <jbicha> I guess we don't have to worry about polkit yet? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1578990/
[06:54] <darkxst> yeh ubuntu's polkit is old
[16:18] <jbicha> ricotz: what do you think about copying your gtk git snapshot to the staging ppa since it fixes the annoying filechooser size bug (and also fixes https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692571 )
[16:18] <ubot5> Gnome bug 692571 in gtk "content is offcenter in Settings window when run in non-GNOME Shell" [Critical,Resolved: fixed]
[16:19] <ricotz> jbicha, yeah, that filechooser thing was annoying
[16:19] <ricotz> jbicha, if you are comfortable with it, i don't have anything against it
[16:20] <ricotz> (binary copy, of course)
[16:21] <jbicha> sure, doing it now
[16:21] <ricotz> ok
[17:39] <ricotz> jbicha, btw the cogl 1.13.2 might be a same story with its soname bumps (currenty 12), so better to hold it back
[17:46] <jbicha> ricotz: that's fine, nothing really tends to need the bleeding edge cogl right?
[17:46] <ricotz> jbicha, yeah, fortunately not
[17:47] <ricotz> just saying going through multiple transitions would be a pain
