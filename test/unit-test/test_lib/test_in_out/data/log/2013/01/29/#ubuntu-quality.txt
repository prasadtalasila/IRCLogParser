[00:34] <phillw> Hi Noskcaj can you try ubuntu-core out with test-drive? ubuntu-server is showing as over sized for a CD iso.

[17:49] <cprofitt> ello all
[17:49] <cprofitt> It looks like my fevor has broken... now we just have to worry about my son in Thursday
[17:49] <cprofitt> balloons: ping
[17:49] <cprofitt> sorry that I have been out of things for a few days
[17:53] <balloons> cprofitt, sorry you got sick!
[17:53] <balloons> :-(
[17:53] <cprofitt> yeah... the worse part is it happend right when my son did
[17:53] <cprofitt> having his face swell up was very frightening for a parent
[17:56] <balloons> yes -- that stuff gets serious fast
[17:56] <SergioMeneses> cprofitt, morning!
[17:56] <SergioMeneses> it is nice to see you
[17:56] <SergioMeneses> balloons, \o
[17:56] <cprofitt> thanks SergioMeneses I am glad to be online again
[17:56] <balloons> hello hello!
[17:57] <cprofitt> I was out of it since Sunday with the flu
=== Ursinha-afk is now known as Ursinha
[18:21] <phillw> cprofitt: good to see you back, I hope your son is also getting better.
[18:22] <cprofitt> his infection is doing better -- they remove the tooth on Thursday
[18:22] <cprofitt> thanks phillw
[18:25] <phillw> good to hear he (and you) are on the mend.
[18:25] <cprofitt> anyone else having issues with Ubuntu One on 13.04?
[18:25] <cprofitt> I am getting an IPCError
[18:33] <cprofitt> balloons: what is the other project that is making use of the testing data?
=== Ursinha is now known as Ursinha-afk
[18:33] <balloons> we had hoped for a hexr instance
[18:33] <balloons> it's another tool
[18:33] <cprofitt> yep, that is the one

[19:12] <lagreca> Hi! Pepperflash's Chrome Stable is showing colored artifacts when playing youtube videos. Can it be solved? Thanks. PS: UBUNTU 12.04.1
[19:12] <lagreca> The same doesn't happen in unity 2d.
[19:15] <njin> what's pepperflash ?
[19:20] <njin> is a chrome plugin, and then if it is not working on 3d acceleration, the problem is with that plugin, flashplayer still working.
[19:21] <njin> so I think that the problem needs to be reported to the chrome developers
[19:28] <TheLordOfTime> or the plugin devs
[19:28] <TheLordOfTime> if its a 3rd-party plugin
[19:28] <TheLordOfTime> also...
[19:29] <TheLordOfTime> !crosspost | lagreca
[19:29] <ubot5> lagreca: Please don't ask the same question in multiple Ubuntu channels at the same time. Many helpers are in more than one channel and it's not fair to them or the other people seeking support.
[19:38] <lagreca> meu cu pisca... sorry
[19:49] <letozaf_> balloons, I was looking at the Evince Autopilot testcase, the link to the installation instructions is empty is this ok ?
[19:49] <letozaf_> bye the way, hello!
[19:49] <balloons> hello!
[19:49] <thomi> good morning everyone
[19:49] <balloons> letozaf_, where at do you mean?
[19:50] <letozaf_> thomi, Hi in Italy it's night :D
[19:50] <thomi> balloons: quick update: the gcalc crashing bug has been worked-around. It's most likely a bug in Gtk, but there's a workaround in AP-gtk for now.
[19:50] <letozaf_> balloons, http://packages.qa.ubuntu.com/qatracker/milestones/251/builds/34676/downloads
[19:50] <thomi> balloons: I'm just verifying the fix now
[19:50] <balloons> I missed njin :-(
[19:50] <balloons> thomi, excellent.. I figured as much, but I reported it anyway
[19:50] <balloons> since gtk is not going to be fixed
[19:51] <thomi> balloons: well, we're hoping we can patch it
[19:51] <thomi> apparently it's a reasonably simple problem
[19:52] <balloons> ohh nice
[19:52] <balloons> letozaf_, yes sadly i know it's blank
[19:52] <balloons> I've been working on several things, but I'm trying again right now actually on the ppa
[19:52] <balloons> until it's up, no instructions :-)
[19:53] <letozaf_> balloons, ah ok!
[19:53] <balloons> yea.. :-(
[19:53] <balloons> so thomi the ap session is tomorrow
[19:53] <balloons> while your sleeping :-)
[19:53] <thomi>  :(
[19:53] <balloons> I don't think you'd be up
[19:53] <balloons> maybe..
[19:53] <thomi> balloons: an IRC session?
[19:54] <balloons> yes
[19:54] <thomi> what time?
[19:54] <balloons> now
[19:54] <balloons> for the past hour I think is the time
[19:54] <balloons> let me check
[19:54] <thomi> oh ok,
[19:54] <thomi> balloons: if you think my presence would be beneficial, I can get up early
[19:54] <balloons> 1800  UTC
[19:55] <balloons> so 2 hours ago :-)
[19:55] <thomi> oh
[19:55] <balloons> yea.. a bit much.. hmm
[19:55] <balloons> well, let me see something
[19:55] <thomi> still doable... 7AM, only an hour earlier then when I usually get to work
[19:55] <balloons> I could swap with mhall to ge thte last session of the day
[19:55] <balloons> let me ask him
[19:56] <balloons> that would push it to 1900 utc
[19:56] <balloons> which should work for you sounds like
[20:00] <thomi> balloons: either way - I'm happy to get up an hour early... means I can quit an hour early too :)
[20:01]  * balloons thinks I should frame the git -> bzr reference
[20:01] <thomi> huh?
[20:02] <balloons> http://doc.bazaar.canonical.com/migration/en/survival/bzr-for-git-users.html
[20:02] <balloons> I constantly type things like bzr reset, bzr checkout, etc, etc
[20:03] <balloons> I need bzr revert
[20:04] <balloons> git reset HEAD --hard does nothing for me in bzr ;-)
[20:05] <thomi> balloons: ahhh, I do the opposite - try and use bzr in a git repo
[20:06] <balloons> yea.. I'm a git baby, so everything in bzr is just reference to git
[20:06] <balloons> if you used bzr more / first, well.. it's the same
[20:06] <balloons> the funny thing is, I like parts of both of them ;-)
[20:07] <thomi> heh. THe only thing I like baout git.... is the name :P
[20:07] <thomi> that's not acutally true
[20:11] <balloons> ok, so gotta stay with 1800 utc.. can't swap
[20:12] <balloons> so, yea, if you want to be around, I would appreciate it :-0
[20:13] <thomi> ok, I'll do my best
[20:14] <letozaf_> balloons, it's strange today's raring-desktop-armhf+omap4.img   is only 22 MB large
[20:19] <balloons> hehe
[20:19] <balloons> nice
[20:19] <balloons> it failed to build
[20:19] <balloons> shouldn't be anything there
[20:20] <balloons> all the arm images pretty mch failed
[20:25] <balloons> letozaf_, ok, package is pushed up again.. let's see if it sticks
[20:25] <balloons> denied
[20:25] <balloons> lp still hates me
[20:25] <letozaf_> :D
[20:40] <balloons> Accepted:
[20:40] <balloons>  OK: ubuntu-autopilot-tests_0.10ubuntu1-1ubuntu1.tar.gz
[20:40] <balloons>  OK: ubuntu-autopilot-tests_0.10ubuntu1-1ubuntu1.dsc
[20:40] <balloons> we're in :-)
[20:43] <balloons> want to try it out letozaf_ ?
[20:43] <balloons> https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-testcase/+archive/autopilot-tests
[20:43] <letozaf_> balloons, yes
[20:43] <balloons> bah.. it's still pending.. but should be up in a hour.. tomorrow for you probably
[20:44] <balloons> regardless, I can update the instructions now :-)
[20:44] <letozaf_> balloons, I will try tomorrow for sure!
[20:48] <letozaf_> balloons, how does it work, I mean I have the ubuntu-autopilot-tests bzr branch on my PC if I add the PPA can I mess up something
=== Ursinha-afk is now known as Ursinha
[20:53] <balloons> no it won't
[20:53] <balloons> for you, lol, nothing really changes
[20:54] <balloons> since it's just packaged versions of the branch
[20:54] <letozaf_> balloons, fine, just wanted to be sure!
[20:54] <balloons> it puts them in /usr ....

[22:00] <philipballew> SergioMeneses, hello
[22:01] <SergioMeneses> philipballew, hi how are you? we have to work again on the portal
[22:01] <phillw> SergioMeneses: are there any pre-requisites that you need people to have for the classroom sessions? E.g. for section 3 we are asking https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Activities/Classroom/Section3
[22:01] <philipballew> When can we work on that?
[22:03] <SergioMeneses> phillw, maybe, there are not in my session but I dont know in the other one
[22:04] <SergioMeneses> just let me ask to SergioZ and we'll edit the wiki page later
[22:06] <phillw> okies, just create a Section4 sub page if you need :)
[22:11] <SergioMeneses> phillw, perfect! thanks for helping

[22:45] <Noskcaj> can someone please confirm this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1087409 outside of Vbox?

[23:24] <Noskcaj> balloons, phillw: the iso tracker has frozen for precise, kubuntu alternate
[23:25] <phillw> Noskcaj: precise?
[23:25] <Noskcaj> 12.04
[23:27] <phillw> yeah, I see.. you'd need to ask the kubuntu team about that. I know that 12.04.2 is looming.
[23:27] <Noskcaj> i just did and was told to ask here
[23:28] <Noskcaj> and once again, can someone please confirm this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1087409 outside of Vbox?

[23:28] <phillw> hmm, I think -release may be better placed to answer
[23:28] <Noskcaj> FFS
[23:30] <phillw> Noskcaj: ask xnox if he needs any more information. As I read the bug, you have answered his request. I can run it in KVM with lubuntu if he needs more information.
[23:31] <Noskcaj> phillw: if you could, i just need to confirm if it's Vbox only, like my graphical issues
[23:32] <phillw> It will not be tonight (23:32 UTC), but I'll create a new VM tomorrow for it. I have the tab open on my browser to remind me :)
[23:35] <Noskcaj> ok, ty
[23:37] <phillw> Noskcaj: ahh, I need a desktop iso :/
[23:38] <phillw> let me zsync up my lubuntu one... this will take a while, so it can run over night.
[23:41] <phillw> well, I have 58% of it on my system :)
