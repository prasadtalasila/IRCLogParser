[19:14] <thorwil> godbyk-feynman: into physics today? should it be "L'équipe du manuel Ubuntu" or "Équipe du manuel Ubuntu"?
[19:26] <thorwil> godbyk-feynman: double-fr.svg pushed, using "L'équipe du manuel Ubuntu" on the back like it was on the front of the single version already
[19:37] <godbyk-feynman> thorwil: Heh. feynman is the name of the computer I'm on. It's my secondary irc nick. Not sure why it fell back to it, though.
=== godbyk-feynman is now known as godbyk
[19:37] <godbyk> thorwil: Also, If L'équipe is consistent, then go with that. I just copied and pasted the text from the interior of the manual, so it may be a different context.
[19:46] <thorwil> ok
[19:50] <cqfd93> Hi All!
[19:52] <cqfd93> thorwil and godbyk: in "l'Équipe...", "l'" stands for "the"
[19:55] <thorwil> cqfd93: hi! so it should be there, both on the front and back?
[20:04] <cqfd93> If "The Ubuntu Manual Team" is both on the front and back, yes
[20:51] <godbyk> Thanks, cqfd93.
[20:51] <godbyk> thorwil: I updated the cover to change 12.10 to 12.04 on the back cover, btw.
[21:07] <cqfd93> you're welcome, godbyk
[21:07] <thorwil> godbyk: heh, i even noticed when reading the email, but then forgot about it
[21:08] <thorwil> gotta run, g'night!
[21:33] <godbyk> cqfd93: Hey, Sylvie. How would you translate 'user'?
[21:43] <cqfd93> godbyk: user = utilisateur
[21:43] <godbyk> cqfd93: Thanks.
[21:43] <godbyk> cqfd93: I'm just tidying up a few last details on the French precise-e2 manual.
[21:45] <cqfd93> godbyk: please, give me the sentence that contains this word
[21:56] <godbyk> cqfd93: It stands alone. It's in the file system diagram.
[21:56] <godbyk> cqfd93: You had your own name there. I thought I should replace it with something more generic.
[21:57] <godbyk> cqfd93: It refers to the /home/user directory (as opposed to /home/sylvie).
[22:00] <CarstenG> Hi Kevin
[22:00] <CarstenG> Is there still the transparency issue with the new printing service?
[22:00] <godbyk> Hey, CarstenG.
[22:01] <godbyk> CarstenG: I haven't encountered any problems yet, but I've only had a couple people purchase the English version of 12.10.
[22:01] <godbyk> CarstenG: They do tell me when they detect transparency, though, and they flatten it for us.
[22:01] <godbyk> CarstenG: All the same, I'm trying to flatten everything on our end, too. Just to reduce the number of potential problems.
[22:02] <CarstenG> ok
[22:02] <CarstenG> nice to see that the Dutch version is already online :-)
[22:02] <CarstenG> good work
[22:02] <CarstenG> Does Hannie know about it?
[22:02] <cqfd93> With Enrico, we thought we could use a real name and he choose my name :-)
[22:03] <CarstenG> Sylvie, yes, a real name would be good there. In the quantal version we changed the "user" to "John Doe"
[22:03] <godbyk> CarstenG: Yep. I emailed Hannie about it so she could post the release notice herself (since I figure it's likely she'll want it written in Dutch).
[22:04] <godbyk> CarstenG: Ah, did we change it there?  Okay. I'll keep an eye on that next time.
[22:04] <CarstenG> Its a place holder name.
[22:05] <godbyk> CarstenG: Yeah. I know we had discussed changing the placeholders everywhere to a generic name, but I didn't think that applied to precise-e2.
[22:05] <CarstenG> I think there is also a place holder name in France, or?
[22:05] <CarstenG> Yes, Kevin, not in the pot file
[22:06] <CarstenG> But for German for example, I used "Erika" also in precise-e2
[22:06] <CarstenG> Well, in the screenshots until now.
[22:07] <godbyk> CarstenG: I had to modify the French 06-root-directories screenshot because part of it was clipped slightly at the edges and because I wanted it in a flat PNG format.
[22:08] <godbyk> CarstenG: So I just opened the original SVG in Inkscape and transferred over Sylvie's translations (except for the 'user' dir).
[22:08] <CarstenG> I see.
[22:11] <CarstenG> Well, I think I will skip the PDF version of that screenshot in the raring release.
[22:11] <CarstenG> The png version is better.
[22:11] <godbyk> CarstenG: Agreed.
[22:12] <godbyk> CarstenG: The PDF version was great except that it's transparent.
[22:12] <godbyk> CarstenG: So now I export to PNG and flatten that.
[22:15] <CarstenG> Well, I get an make error for the French precise-e2
[22:15] <CarstenG> ! Unable to load picture or PDF file 'titlepage/halftitlepage-fr.pdf'.
[22:15] <CarstenG> Is it because of your change from \providecommand{\printscreen}{screen} to {print}?
[22:17] <godbyk> CarstenG: Oh, let me add that to the repository.. one moment.
[22:17] <godbyk> CarstenG: Okay, it's pushed now.
[22:17] <CarstenG> ok
[22:18] <CarstenG> and yes, it was this change :-)
[22:18] <godbyk> CarstenG: The half title pages are only used in the print versions.
[22:19] <CarstenG> btw the \listfiles is not really necessary, or?
[22:19] <godbyk> CarstenG: It's not necessary.. it just outputs the files, timestamps, and versions to the log file. It's useful when I'm trying to troubleshoot a problem someone is having.
[22:19] <godbyk> CarstenG: It doesn't affect the PDF at all.
[22:20] <CarstenG> And one more: :-) 6149x3953 px for the 06-root-directories.png is a little bit much. :-)
[22:21] <godbyk> CarstenG: Well, I exported it at 600 dpi for printing.  Otherwise CreateSpace yells at my for low-resolution images. :)
[22:21] <godbyk> CarstenG: I might be able to drop it to 300 dpi. I'll check.
[22:21] <CarstenG> 1027x 768 should be enough, as the other screenshots.
[22:21] <CarstenG> ah ok
[22:22] <godbyk> CarstenG: Yeah, CreateSpace gets after me about our low-res screenshots, too.  I'm not sure if there's a way to take higher-resolution screenshots and keep them readable, though.
[22:23] <godbyk> CarstenG: I could just resample the screenshots at a higher resolution, but then they'd just take more file space and not provide any more detail. So it's not really worth it.
[22:24] <CarstenG> I agree
[22:24] <CarstenG> In my copy from ulu the screenshots are readable
[22:25] <CarstenG> So I expect this for createspace, too.
[22:25] <godbyk> CarstenG: They're readable for me in both the Lulu and CreateSpace copies I have, but they do appear a little grainy (dithered).
[22:25] <CarstenG> Yes
[22:26] <CarstenG> this can also be a result of printing black/white?
[22:26] <godbyk> That's part of it. I think it's also partly due to the lower resolution.
[22:26] <CarstenG> It would be interessting to see a color printing...
[22:26] <CarstenG> yes of course
[22:29] <godbyk> CarstenG: Remind me when I get to the German one and I'll create one for you.
[22:29] <CarstenG> Yes, don’t worry. I keep this in mind. :-)
[22:32] <godbyk> It looks like CreateSpace wants 300 dpi or higher. So I'll re-export the root dirs image at 300 dpi instead.  That should reduce the PDF file size a bit. :)
[22:33] <CarstenG> Which dpi 1024x768 would be?
[22:35] <godbyk> Oops.. hit Ctrl+W with the wrong window focused. :-/
[22:35] <godbyk> CarstenG: I'm not sure what dpi those end up being.. but pretty low.
[22:36] <godbyk> The root dirs image at 300 dpi is 3074×1976.
[22:36] <godbyk> But that one doesn't follow the same scaling as the screenshots.
[22:37] <CarstenG> Well, if I scroll through the PDF, Evince lags when it comes into the near of the root directory screenshot...
[22:37] <CarstenG> I think this is because of the file size.
[22:38] <godbyk> If we take a full screenshot at 1024×768 resolution and the screenshot fits into the main text block area (about 304 pt), then that'd be a resolution of 243 dpi (if I did the math correctly).
[22:38] <CarstenG> Why does this not follow the same scaling?
[22:38] <CarstenG> It is a png as the others...
[22:39] <CarstenG> well, this 243 dpi would be ok in my eyes...
[22:39] <godbyk> Well, it follows the same scaling factor within the PDF itself, but the actual PNG isn't necessarily 1024×768.
[22:40] <CarstenG> This is what I wanted to say: You can export it from Inkscape with 1024x768 :-)
[22:42] <godbyk> CarstenG: If I do that, then that image is just under 100 dpi.
[22:43] <CarstenG> ;-) as all the other screenshots, too. :-)
[22:44] <godbyk> We may want to redo this image anyway for raring, since it doesn't contain all the directories that are described in the manual.
[22:44] <CarstenG> one moment, you wrote, it would be 243 dpi?
[22:44] <godbyk> The regular screenshots are (I think) 243 dpi.
[22:44] <godbyk> But this SVG exported at 1024 px would only be 100 dpi.
[22:45] <CarstenG> mmmh...
[22:46] <CarstenG> a normal screenshot with 1024 px width in the text block comes to 243 dpi
[22:47] <CarstenG> our svg export with 1024 px width in the text block comes to 100 dpi?
[22:47] <CarstenG> I’m wondering...
[22:47] <godbyk> Yes.
[22:48] <CarstenG> Same px size, same text block --> same dpi. (IMHO)
[22:48] <godbyk> The original SVG isn't 1024 pixels wide.
[22:49] <CarstenG> But does this matters?
[22:50] <CarstenG> I thought: (pixel size) / (text block width) = dpi value
[22:50] <godbyk> Well, here's what I know: When I go to the export dialog box and tell it to export the drawing at 1024 pixels wide, it says the dpi is 99.93. :)
[22:50] <godbyk> CarstenG: That's true, yes.
[22:51] <CarstenG> Well, I’m confused... I think its time for bed now. :-)
[22:51] <godbyk> LOL. You and me both. :-)
[22:52] <godbyk> We'll just blame Inkscape for now. ;-)
[22:52] <CarstenG> hey you have 5 pm there...
[22:52] <godbyk> True.. no sleepiness excuses for me, sadly.
[22:53] <CarstenG> ok, we can discuss tomorrow again. :-)
[22:53] <CarstenG> Good afternoon.
[22:53] <CarstenG> see you
[22:53] <godbyk> Sounds good.
[22:53] <godbyk> G'night, CarstenG!
