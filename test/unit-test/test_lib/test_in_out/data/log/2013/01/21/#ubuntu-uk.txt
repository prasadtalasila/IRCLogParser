[09:47] <Laney> what happened?
[09:48] <dwatkins> snow
[09:49] <knightwise> Hey everyone
[09:49] <Laney> AHA!
[09:50] <MartijnVdS> Lots of snow happened here
[09:51] <knightwise> And an earthquake MartijnVdS
[09:51]  * knightwise spent 3 hours on his commute to work
[09:51] <dwatkins> my brother got part-way to work then turned around and is now working from home
[09:51] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: That earthquake was in a different country :P
[09:52] <knightwise> MartijnVdS Limburg is still part of the netherlands :) right ?
[09:52]  * MartijnVdS didn't even try going to work... trains are always (snow-)flaky
[09:53] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: We don't call people who live there "reserve-belgen" for nothing :P
[09:57] <knightwise> Lol MartijnVdS , I thought Brabanders were 'reserve belgen'
[09:58] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: "belg" = "ben eerst limburger geweest"
[09:58] <knightwise> MartijnVdS: :) What does that make me ?
[09:58] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: weird
[09:58] <knightwise> I hardly still fit the description of 'a belgian' :p
[09:58] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: you don't keep a knife at work, to cut corners?
[09:59] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: (yay belgenmoppen)
[10:00] <directhex> working from home means no snow days :'(
[10:00] <MartijnVdS> directhex: you could work nights..
[10:00] <MartijnVdS> directhex: and build snowmen during the day
[10:01] <directhex> i mean snow day as in "can't get to work, sorry, i still get paid though right?"
[10:01] <MartijnVdS> directhex: yeah :)
[10:01] <directhex> don't wanna go *outside*
[10:02] <MartijnVdS> I need to refill the wiper fluid in my car :(
[10:02] <MartijnVdS> worst timing EVER
[10:02] <knightwise> define 'cannot get to work'
[10:02] <knightwise> i mean , you can always WALK to work
[10:02] <knightwise> MartijnVdS: i have been surfing in stray spraywater from drivers in front of me to clean my windshield :)
[10:03] <directhex> my office is 85 miles from my home
[10:03] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: if walking to work and back takes so long you won't be able to work a full day, that's "cannot get to work" :)
[10:07] <knightwise> directhex: you are excused
[10:13] <knightwise> Ah crud
[10:13] <knightwise> looks like i'm getting a laptop from work :(
[10:13] <knightwise> Probably some 25 pound 15 inch behemoth
[10:13] <knightwise> runnig XP
[10:15] <directhex> yay!
[10:15] <directhex> i have a work laptop too
[10:16] <directhex> lenovo x230 with ubuntu
[10:16] <directhex> standard company offering.... i wrote the standard :D
[10:17] <directhex> it's good to be king
[10:17] <knightwise> directhex: i hate you
[10:17]  * knightwise uses 12.10 on his macbook air (11.6 inch) with a citrix client
[10:18] <dogmatic69> anyone want to guess where my server is? http://i.imgur.com/A3K2NTd.jpg
[10:19] <directhex> under the snow?
[10:19] <dogmatic69> directhex: the only building with no snow on the roof :D
[10:21] <knightwise> Dude ,thats poorly isolated then
[10:21] <popey> morning
[10:21] <MartijnVdS> \o popey
[10:23] <knightwise> hey popey
[10:23] <dogmatic69> knightwise: isolated? or insulated
[10:24] <knightwise> erm ... insulated
[10:24]  * knightwise is not a native speaker
[10:25] <dogmatic69> ye, there is no insulation there
[10:30] <MartijnVdS> This is what the world looks like for me: http://i.imgur.com/xqe1PrS.jpg
[10:31] <Laney> idyllic
[10:31]  * Laney coughs
[10:32] <directhex> little boxes
[10:32] <directhex> on a hillside
[10:32] <MartijnVdS> directhex: hillside?!
[10:32] <popey> they dream of hills
[10:33] <MartijnVdS> this is polder country! :)
[10:33] <knightwise> Dutch don't have hills.
[10:33] <knightwise> 80  percent of their country is below sealevel
[10:33] <knightwise> its like God tried to tell them something there...
[10:37] <dwatkins> or perhaps just that they're going against the flow...

[10:38] <MartijnVdS> dwatkins: proof ;)
[10:42] <knightwise> MartijnVdS: LOL :) God .. that train is a disaster !
[10:42] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: .. I have a Fyra ticket to go to FOSDEM in 2 weeks
[10:42] <MartijnVdS> knightwise: good thing the return journey is by Thalys
[10:43] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[10:44] <knightwise> MartijnVdS: I'm still waiting for word back from canonical if they are going to bring one of those Ubuntu phones to Fossdem
[10:44] <knightwise> If so : i'm going too
[10:44] <popey> i thought I answered that for you?
[10:45] <knightwise> popey: I called the secretary ( Michelle Surtees) who was going to make some extra inquiry
[10:45] <knightwise> (it never hurts to try)
[10:46]  * directhex is skipping fosdem this year
[10:48] <popey> hahaha
=== Lcawte|Away is now known as Lcawte
[10:49] <popey> Can I just point out that Michelle isn't my (or anyone's) secretary, before I get a punch in the nuts from her.
[10:49] <knightwise> oops .. sorry ! :)
[10:49] <michelle_> popey: lol thank you :)
[10:49] <popey> â˜º
[10:49] <knightwise> Oh Crud !
[10:49] <knightwise> Michelle ?
[10:49] <michelle_> knightwise: heh apology accepted :)
[10:49] <michelle_> hi
[10:49] <popey> tee hee
[10:50] <knightwise> I've NEVER blushed on IRC before ..
[10:50] <knightwise> But .. now I do ! :p))
[10:50] <michelle_> knightwise: lol
[10:50] <Azelphur> popey: Cube reflection and deformation, Wallpaper, Extra animations, Color filter, Cube gears, Reflection, etc...
[10:50] <Azelphur> just to reply to yesterdays question :P
[10:51] <popey> some of that was disabled as we migrated to GLES for ARM
[10:51] <popey> if I recall correctly
[10:51] <Azelphur> think so, yea
[10:52] <Azelphur> the API has been changed too so you can't build/install the plugins yourself
[10:52] <Azelphur> :<
[10:53] <Azelphur> I'll probably uninstall Ubuntu's compiz and jump onto stable
[10:54] <popey> stable meaning 0.8?
[10:54] <Azelphur> yea
[10:55] <popey> interesting
[10:56] <Azelphur> 0.9 has always been a bit dodgy, but there again it has always been Ubuntu added bugs apparently
[10:56] <Azelphur> like the cube flickering bug in 12.04 XD
[10:57] <Laney> did you check the 'compiz-plugins' package
[10:58] <Azelphur> Laney: yea, there's bug reports up and stuff for it
[10:59] <Laney> hmm
[10:59] <Azelphur> https://answers.launchpad.net/compiz/+question/206524
[11:00] <Laney> +  In order to complete support for OpenGL|ES, some plugins were not (yet)
[11:00] <Laney> +  ported and have been disabled for now. Those are: animationaddon, bicubic,
[11:00] <Laney> +  blur, colorfilter, cubeaddon, gears, group, loginout, reflex, thumbnail,
[11:00] <Laney> +  stackswitch, wallpaper, trip. However, those are only 13 out of 84 plugins.
[11:01] <Laney> +  We welcome patches to revive the disabled plugins.
[11:01] <popey> ok, so not the ones Azelphur listed
[11:01] <Azelphur> indeed :P
[11:01] <popey> oh, some
[11:01] <Azelphur> uhh, yes the ones I listed?
[11:01] <Azelphur> xD
[11:01] <Azelphur> Cube reflection and deformation = cubeaddon
[11:01] <Azelphur> Extra animations = animationaddon
[11:02] <Azelphur> I'm not too grumpy about most of them, but wallpaper I make heavy use of, and not having cubeaddon / extra animations is annoying aesthetically :P
[11:02] <popey> you can probably just enable them and rebuild?
[11:03] <popey> given you're not on ARM
[11:03] <Azelphur> nah as I say, API changes stop them from being built
[11:04] <popey> oh, because they weren't maintained..
[11:05] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:05] <Azelphur> in Ubuntus fork of compiz that introduces API changes, sure I guess :p
[11:05] <Azelphur> they are fine in mainline afaik
[11:06] <popey> what desktop would you use with compiz 0.8?
[11:06] <Laney> you could look at what work is needed to fix them in lp:compiz :-)
[11:06] <Azelphur> popey: I run Xubuntu now days
[11:07] <Azelphur> Last I checked Unity falls over on separate X screens, but I havn't checked it for 6 months or so
[11:07] <Azelphur> I use Unity on my laptop though
[11:08] <AlanBell> Laney: is the upshot of bug 954352 that we will get a working wayland in Raring?
[11:08] <lubotu3> bug 954352 in gtk+3.0 (Ubuntu Raring) "Enable wayland backend" [Wishlist,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/954352
[11:08] <Azelphur> that would be cool :o
[11:08] <kvarley> Is there a good resource that will explain simply why Wayland is better than X11?
[11:08] <kvarley> Or why Wayland will be replacing X11 in the end
[11:09] <AlanBell> doesn't mean it will be used by default, just that GTK will be compiled to be compatible with it
[11:10] <Laney> if it all pans out you'll be able to use the gdk backend
[11:10] <Azelphur> kvarley: X11 has a lot of cruft, it's rapidly approaching it's 30th birthday. It was designed in an era where 3d accelerated graphics cards didn't exist and everybody used monochrome displays. Wayland has native compositing, tear free, and lots of other very nice features.
[11:10] <Laney> someone else is taking care of the bureaucratic task
[11:10] <kvarley> Azelphur: So in the end most distros will use Wayland?
[11:10] <Azelphur> kvarley: hopefully, but I think that's a few years off yet.
[11:10] <directhex> we have devs working on wayland.
[11:11] <Azelphur> I can't wait for wayland, so many fixes for things that affect me

[11:41] <brobostigon> whats a good simple program, i can use, to pickup pictures from a webcam connected to my rpi ?
[11:41] <popey> webcam
[11:42] <brobostigon> ok, good name, :)
[11:42] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: look for programs that do "v4l" (or v4l2) -- those should be able to do it
[11:43] <MartijnVdS> vlc can stream video :)
[11:43] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: good point yes. as that is aplication interface.
[11:43] <popey> i want to re-stream my home webcam using vlc, couldn't quite get it working
[11:43] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: there's a no-x version of vlc
[11:43] <popey> cvlc
[11:44] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: now that would be useful.
[11:44] <brobostigon> let me look up both.
[11:45] <popey> i tried using cvlc but it actually spat the video out to the console, aalib style
[11:46] <brobostigon> interesting.
[11:48] <dwatkins> I assume that's not its aim
[11:49] <MartijnVdS> http://www.videolan.org/doc/streaming-howto/en/
[11:49] <MartijnVdS> that's old docs
[11:50] <MartijnVdS> http://wiki.videolan.org/Documentation:Streaming_HowTo_New is newer
[11:51] <brobostigon> isnt vlc rather large a package ?
[11:51] <czajkowski> http://hackntalk.eventbrite.com/   BigRedS if you're back in London
[11:54] <davmor2> popey: xeoma maybe? It's in USC don't know how much :)
[11:59] <brobostigon> i do a search on ubuntu and webcam, and what is the first result, popey.com
[12:10] <brobostigon> as it says on popey's blog, how do i setup apache, to pickup pictures scp'd into said users home dir ?
[12:11] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: a2enmod userdir
[12:11] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: then put the files in ~/public_html/
[12:11] <MartijnVdS> (or some directory below that)
[12:12] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: so that will then outwardly look like taylorworld.me.uk/user/etc ?
[12:12] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: /~username/etc.
[12:13] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: ok, let me try that, thank you.
[12:19] <mungbean> unsure whether to use nouveau or nvidia drivers for fastest desktop experience - have always used nvidia but wondering if nouveau is sufficient for desktop?
[12:21] <gord> try it and find out?

[12:28] <mungbean> its flippin' fast
[12:34] <brobostigon> question, webcam is working, but it is repeatingly asking me for my ssh pasword, which it shouldnt, as i have it specified in webcams config file. any ideas?
[12:35] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: set up a special account + ssh key + scp-only access ?
[12:36] <popey> bug 1075539
[12:36] <lubotu3> Error: Launchpad bug 1075539 could not be found
[12:36] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: umm, ok.
[12:38] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: ssh with a password-less key is great, except it allows access to all the things, as you
[12:38] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: hence the "separate account" suggestion
[12:39] <MartijnVdS> you could probably limit the key on your normal account as well.. let me find something
[12:39] <MartijnVdS> http://michaelahale.com/blog/2008/08/01/restrict-an-ssh-user-to-scp-only-access/
[12:39] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: more infoz on authorized-keys: http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/help/jpmg/ssh/authorized_keys_howto.html
[12:40] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: ah, i see, yes, interesting, thank you.
[12:41] <brobostigon> this will be new, also i have not tried with ssh keys alot before.
[12:49] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: if you have 2 machines to try it on, go for it :)
[12:49] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: it's a very useful thing to know when sysadmining
[12:49] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: certainly, i can imagine, i have just been reading about them, :)
[13:19] <kvarley> Anybody know of a packaged version of Ambiance for XFCE 4.10 (running on XUbuntu) ?
[13:20] <kvarley> The one I use normally hasn't been updated for 12.10 yet
[13:47] <brobostigon> weird, i have setup ssh keys for that webcam user, and it is still asking for the key passphrase on every upload.
[13:48] <kvarley> brobostigon: ssh-add ?
[13:48] <mgdm> are the permissions on the various key files correct?
[13:48] <mgdm> That always gets me, I set them to 600
[13:48] <brobostigon> kvarley: done,
[13:50] <brobostigon> kvarley: let me check that, server end?
[13:50] <mgdm> both ends, but yeah, .ssh/authorized_keys is often the one that's not quite right
[13:51] <brobostigon> ok.

[15:00] <brobostigon> ok, i have added ssh public key, to authorized_keys on both end, and webcam is still asking for my password for is_rsa everytime it tries to upload still.
[15:01] <dwatkins> brobostigon: on a new shell can you ssh without the need for a passwd nor passphrase?
[15:01] <brobostigon> dwatkins: let me try.
[15:02] <popey> you probably want to run "ssh-agent screen" then in the screen run "ssh-add" to add your key then run "webcam"
[15:02] <popey> (that's what i do)

[19:31] <BigRedS> I need to make a few packages that will each consist of a shell script to dump in /usr/sbin and a config file in /etc. What's the current least-excessive-faff way of doing that?
[20:07] <brobostigon> interesting, i just did a quickie calculation, of webcam recording for 30mins, and then scaling it up to 24hrs, it would make roughly 120mb of images and 14448 images. which seems like an awful lot.
[20:12] <dwatkins> I do wonder how youtube manages those "10 hours of nyan cat" videos
[20:12] <daftykins> brobostigon: what purpose is that for? security cam style?
[20:12] <dwatkins> does someone upload a 20 minute video that's just repeated 30 times?
[20:12] <brobostigon> daftykins: kinda, yes.
[20:13] <brobostigon> daftykins: i am using xawtv webcam program, as popey suggested earlier.
[20:13] <daftykins> brobostigon: an electrician i had do a job told me about these ones he put up nearby, motion activated with custom sounds and SD card for storage :>
[20:13] <brobostigon> daftykins: ok.
[20:13] <daftykins> so he put a recording of himself whispering on it, as naturally you look up toward that
[20:13] <daftykins> if you could put motion detection in, so it only records then, that'd be neat
[20:14] <brobostigon> daftykins: i do believe it does that already.
[20:15] <daftykins> should solve the storage element then
[20:16] <brobostigon> as far as i can tell, in my 30min sample. there was only movement in it, for around 15secs, as i walked past it.
[20:16] <daftykins> and it still came to 120MB ?
[20:16] <daftykins> oh it's taking stills?
[20:16] <brobostigon> yes.
[20:17] <brobostigon> daftykins: i calculated that 30 min sample up to 24hrs, and that 120mb is for 24hrs.
[20:17] <daftykins> oh my bad
[20:24] <brobostigon> no worries.
[20:24] <popey> brobostigon: less if you turn it into a video
[20:25] <popey> which is fun to do
[20:25] <brobostigon> so ffmpeg them together?
[20:47] <ali1234> 120mb for 30 minutes of video? that's tiny
[20:48] <brobostigon> no, 120mb, for 24hrs of images, calculated up, from 30mins of images.
[20:48] <dwatkins> extrapolated?
[20:48] <brobostigon> dwatkins: yes.
[20:48] <dwatkins> just checking, not actually repeated
[20:49] <brobostigon> (120mb / 24) / 2
[20:49] <ali1234> so in 30 minutes it took 2.5mb of images?
[20:49] <brobostigon> ali1234: yes.
[20:50] <ali1234> that's like 1 per minute 320x240 jpeg
[20:51] <brobostigon> resolution yes, thats correct, but it is set to 50% jpeg quality.
[21:01] <dwatkins> if that's converted into a video, that should use less space
[21:02] <brobostigon> or i just put a bigger sd card into the rpi.
[21:03] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: You're gonna need a bigger boat - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gciFoEbOA8
[21:03] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: huh ?
[21:04] <MartijnVdS> brobostigon: bigger card.. bigger boat.. jaws
[21:05] <dwatkins> could you upload them periodically, then free up space?
[21:05] <brobostigon> MartijnVdS: ah, :)
[21:06] <brobostigon> dwatkins: cron job, logrotate, could work.
[21:08] <MartijnVdS> mount a remote directory
[21:08] <MartijnVdS> put them there directly ;)
[21:08] <MartijnVdS> you'll have as much space as you put in the remote machine
[21:09] <brobostigon> good thinking batman
[21:09] <MartijnVdS> sshfs, cifs, nfs
[21:11] <brobostigon> libv4l2: error dequeuing buf: Input/output error
[21:11] <brobostigon> v4l2: read: Input/output error
[21:11] <brobostigon> weird error.
[21:26]  * bigcalm grumbles at mysql server. Won't start on my bytemark server. 12.04.1 on it and my local dev machine but the dev machine works
[21:26] <bigcalm> Copied the dev conf over to the bytemark machine and still doesn't work
[21:27] <bigcalm> Anybody with thoughts? :)
[21:29] <daftykins> logs?
[21:31] <bigcalm> daftykins: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1556679/
[21:32] <daftykins> wow that's not very descript
[21:32] <bigcalm> I quite agree
[21:32] <daftykins> aren't there mysql specific logs in a subfolder beneath /var/log ?
[21:32] <bigcalm> Nothing in the mysql error log
[21:32] <daftykins> ah :( i don't really have any experience sadly
[21:34] <bigcalm> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1556687/
[21:38] <daftykins> cannot allocate memory
[21:38] <daftykins> hrmm
[21:39] <bigcalm> Getting close to restarting the server
[21:39] <bigcalm> How does one clear the apt-cache?
[21:39] <daftykins> sudo apt-get clean
[21:40] <bigcalm> Ta
[21:40] <daftykins> ^_^
[21:40] <daftykins> worth running the db daemon on your test box where it works, checking if that buffer size is 128MB there too?
[21:40] <daftykins> to see how it compares
[21:42] <daftykins> gotta head off now though, gl!
[21:45] <bigcalm> rebooting worked :(
[23:07] <technux> anyone here?
[23:30] <AlanBell> technux: yes
