[23:42] <RobOakes> Is it possible to check out one subdirectory of a git repository using bzr?
[23:42] <RobOakes> There are many different projects in the repo, and as I said, I only need the one. (And unfortunately, it is not my repo, or I would happily reorganize it.)
[23:44] <mwhudson> i think the answer is probably now
[23:44] <mwhudson> *not
[23:44] <mwhudson> you can probably something based on fastimport to do that?
[23:44] <mwhudson> er
[23:44] <mwhudson> insert verbs as necessary
[23:45] <RobOakes> mwhudson: That's what I'm looking at now. Is it possible to push changes back to the original repository after using fast-export/import
[23:45] <mwhudson> i doubt it
[23:46] <mwhudson> well, you can always send patches like you would with git i suppose
