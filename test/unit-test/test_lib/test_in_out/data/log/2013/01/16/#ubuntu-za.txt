[08:17] <Kilos> glad to hear it just worked
[08:31] <superfly> Kilos: at the moment? ASUS, I think

[08:34] <superfly> inetpro: that's the previous blog post
[08:35] <inetpro> superfly: thanks
[08:36] <Kilos> ah ty superfly glad to know asus in linux friendly
[08:36] <Vince-0> yoh those are old posts - I find most local blogs etc died out long ago
[08:36] <superfly> mine is practically dead
[08:36] <superfly> I don't often blog
[08:41] <Vince-0> who's is that saturnlaboratories one?
[08:41] <Vince-0> I've got a few I follow RSS on, not many ZA ones though
[08:43] <Vince-0> my G+ feed is the new micro-blog kinda
[08:44] <Vince-0> I started posting to blogger but its quite a bit of effort: http://vince-0.blogspot.com/
[08:47] <Vince-0> I prefer the interaction on G+ . Blog pages seem a bit one sided and I'm no journalist
[08:58] <inetpro> Vince-0: AFAIK that is superfly's own site
[09:01] <Vince-0> aah
[09:02] <superfly> Vince-0: whether or not blogging is a conversation is dependant on how you blog :-)
[09:07] <Vince-0> the platform plays a part in how that conversation flows
[09:07] <Vince-0> do you use G+? 
[09:11] <superfly> I do
[09:12] <Vince-0> add me? Vincent Swart - I havn't kept track of IRL names...
[09:14] <superfly> Vince-0: I did already, a few months ago?
