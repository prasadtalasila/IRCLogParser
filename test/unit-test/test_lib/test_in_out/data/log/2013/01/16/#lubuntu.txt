[08:39] <NvidiaProblems> hello, I have a lenovo thinkpad e530 (Nvidia's GT 630M graphic card) and I'm using lubuntu 12.04. After the last kernel update my monitor resolution is nomore correct. On the main monitor I can't swith to a resolution higer than 640x480 but on the external monitor I can configure the right resolution (1680x1050). I'm using arandr to configure the resolution. I tried to reinstall the nvidia drivers but jockey didn't show me any
[08:40] <NvidiaProblems> I tried to install the drivers from the nvidia site but it isn't fixing anything. May you please help me?

[15:22] <beatsonline> hi everyone .. just let people know ::: https://plus.google.com/communities/102737741860934586009
[15:23] <beatsonline> (Lubuntu google community)
[15:35] <beatsonline> MyLubuntu won't installing any games from the Lubuntu Software center .. and it won't sudo apt-get update either.
[15:36] <beatsonline> I did install thunderbird though.
[15:57] <focus_well> Is there any lubuntu for a IMX6Q Saberlite board available anyone know?
[16:16] <beatsonline> Question :: How do I get game to be installed on Lubuntu using the 'software center', if when, I press install , it fails to install ??
[18:48] <Unit193> beatsonline: Try opening Lubuntu software center from the command line, that should give you some output on what's going on.   I have never used it, so that's about all I can say.
