[00:04] <ttoine> falktx, sure ? you are modest ;-)
[00:04] <falktx> "you're welcome" just never sound good to me
[00:04] <falktx> not a native english person
[00:06] <ttoine> falktx, like me
[00:06] <ttoine> falktx, just a last question
[00:07] <ttoine> I just had a look at cpu frequencies and compared a i7 3.6ghz and A10 3.8ghz... the difference is that the Intel one is 150 â‚¬ more expensive...
[00:07] <falktx> that is surely not the only difference
[00:10] <falktx> doesn't i7 have haskell support?
[00:10] <falktx> VM extensions?
[00:10] <ttoine> are the packages optimised for that ?
[00:10] <falktx> no
[00:10] <ttoine> ...
[00:11] <falktx> ubuntu packages can't be fully optimized, or else they wouldn't work for generic, older CPUs
[00:11] <ttoine> I am just looking at the most cost effective cpu, actually
[00:11] <ttoine> so maybe an amd at 3.8ghz would be better than an Intel at 3.6....
[00:12] <falktx> I guess so
[00:12] <falktx> depends on what you want to do
[00:12] <ttoine> audio with mixbus...
[00:12] <falktx> for me, I would read the VM stuff closely
[00:13] <ttoine> vm for virtual machine ?
[00:13] <ttoine> I see that the quad core Intel have 8 threads. a quadcore amd has only 4 threads...
[00:14] <falktx> yes, vm for that
[00:14] <falktx> my current laptop can't run VMs properly, I hate that
[00:16] <ttoine> falktx, what kind of laptop is it ?
[00:16] <falktx> hp compaq
[00:16] <falktx> cheap old one
[00:16] <falktx> I don't have money for better
[00:16] <ttoine> ok, I understand ;-)
[00:17] <ttoine> My laptop is a second hand thinkpad
[00:17] <ttoine> I don't have money too for a brand new
[00:18] <ttoine> well, 1:18 am in my area. more than time to go to sleep
[00:19] <ttoine> have a goog night / mornig / afternoon ;-)
[00:19] <falktx> ok, you too

[14:54] <smartboyhw> Hi scott-work 
[14:56] <scott-work> good morning smartboyhw 
[14:56] <scott-work> i like cjwatson's email back to you ;)
[14:56] <smartboyhw> LOL
[14:57] <smartboyhw> scott-work, I actually asked in #ubuntu-release, then cjwatson said he fixed it a few minutes ago. LOL
[15:05] <astraljava> I seem to have Contributors' meeting marked on my calendar for this coming Sunday. Is it happening, or is it way outdated markings?
[15:05] <smartboyhw> Should be way outdated
[15:06] <smartboyhw> And I will never be there anyway, it's 1:00 AM for me
[15:06] <astraljava> Ok, thanks. I'll remove all traces of it.
[15:06] <scott-work> astraljava: you might be like me and sharing a google calendar with ubuntu studio on it listing meetings
[15:07] <astraljava> scott-work: Actually, now that I looked more closely, it _is_ coming from somewhere else.
[15:07] <smartboyhw> LOL
[15:07] <astraljava> It's from Mike's, apparently through Fridge.
[15:08] <smartboyhw> Actually it IS in the Fridge Calendar
[15:08] <smartboyhw> Wonder will anyone go and delete it (or change it)
[15:09] <astraljava> If Google Calendar's UI is to be trusted, Mike could just remove it or change to something that actually works for majority of the team.
[15:09] <astraljava> But, for now, I won't pay attention to it.
[15:09] <astraljava> Sorry for the noise, I'm off to sing.
[15:15] <scott-work> "to sing"? for reals? where at?
[15:18] <smartboyhw> scott-work, !?
[15:42] <scott-work> oh, he left. janne had said he was "I'm off to sing." i'm guessing he meant to produce pleasant sound waves emanating from his mouth.
[17:28] <scott-work> there is a ubuntu community council meeting in #ubuntu-meeting right now for ubuntu studio if any want to attend
[17:29] <micahg> len-1304: I'm sorry about -settings, I still have to merge back that accidental upload
[18:39] <scott-work> zequence: i have uploaded to the art-resources bzr branch: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntustudio-dev/ubuntustudio-resources/art
[18:40] <scott-work> i'm not entirely happy with how complete it is or with how i've organized, if you find a more intuitive way or a better way, please feel free to change anything
[19:19] <scott-work> zequence_: did you see above?
[19:19] <scott-work> or quoted again here: zequence: i have uploaded to the art-resources bzr branch: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntustudio-dev/ubuntustudio-resources/art [12:40] <scott-work> i'm not entirely happy with how complete it is or with how i've organized, if you find a more intuitive way or a better way, please feel free to change anything

[21:34] <zequence_> scott-work: Ah, great. I've been away, though it might have not seemed so
[21:35] <scott-work> heh, i realized that i forgot to add the wallpaper though :/  i'll do that tonight as well
[21:36] <zequence_> Missed the community council meeting. Need to start using a calendar 
[21:39] <zequence_> diwic is bringing up some important things on how to set up audio configs on jack devel list and now ubuntu devel list
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[21:39] <zequence> Not too soon
[21:40] <zequence> Would be good to use a standard, which at least all Debian based uses
[21:49] <zequence> Yessss!! I got accepted to the network technician education
[21:49] <zequence> I'm officially starting a career in IT
[21:50] <zequence> Pretty lame to have such difficulty getting accepted, but the competition was really fierce
[22:03] <scott-work> congratulations zequence ! 
[22:04] <zequence> scott-work: Thanks :)
[22:05] <zequence> I had missed that we need to test the kernels after they are made -propsed
[22:05] <zequence> proposed*
[22:05] <zequence> Small matter. Will do that from now on
[22:09] <astraljava> zequence: Huzzah! Conga-rats!
[22:11] <zequence> astraljava: Thanks. Been waiting for a positive answer for 5 months now, or so.
[22:11] <zequence> Will be great to change scenery for a while
[22:11] <zequence> 6-12 months
[22:12] <zequence> That's how long the education lasts. Depending on how fast one is at reading thick IT books in English
[22:12] <zequence> Hope no one bears ill scorn for me, for reading some books about Windows servers :)
[22:13] <len-1304> No harm done.... 
[22:13] <zequence> The teachers have zero skills in Linux, and most of the books deal with Windows
[22:14] <zequence> But, I'll be focusing on Linux as much as possible of course anyway
[22:14] <len-1304> Windows has _more_ to deal with... seems fair.
[22:14] <zequence> Very good point
[22:15] <len-1304> The company I work for uses Windows... because there would be someone to sue if things go wrong.
[22:15] <len-1304> I don't think we have bought a processing machine with out either us suing the maker or the other way around.
[22:16] <zequence> I've heard some really freightening stories about companies paying ridiculous amounts of money for proprietary software, which they also need to use on Windows servers. 
[22:17] <zequence> len-1304: Actually, my sisters husband works for a Post company in Switzerland, and they are wasting millions each year on the wrong setup
[22:17] <len-1304> I know that any SW change we have gotten costs about 10K minimum.
[22:18] <len-1304> So the company might supply Windows, but we generally used a Linux boot CD to install it :)
[22:18] <zequence> hehe
[22:19] <len-1304> Using dd
[22:25] <ttoine> and gparted ;-)
[22:25] <ttoine> zequence, I just missed a happy news, I guess ?
[22:25] <ttoine> what happend ?
[22:31] <zequence> ttoine: I got accepted to an education. Network technician. It's basically an education where I get to study for a number of certificates of my own choice. 
[22:32] <zequence> It's not a very long education, and will ensure that I'll be working in IT, instead of what I've been doing until now - manual labour
[22:32] <zequence> I'm probably going to continue studies at a later point at the university, but until then, having those certificates will be a good thing to have in the bank
[22:33] <ttoine> zequence, it is a kind of work and study deal, to become IT technician ?
[22:33] <ttoine> or you are just student ?
[22:33] <zequence> ttoine: To get one certificate, you need to read a very big book for it. Then you take a test somehwere. Like, a certificate for Windows Server 2008
[22:34] <ttoine> ok
[22:34] <zequence> There's also one called Linux+
[22:34] <ttoine> ;-)
[22:34] <ttoine> great. congratulations !
[22:34] <zequence> Thanks
[22:34] <ttoine> I hope you will find interesting books !
[22:35] <zequence> Me too. But, I will read some on Windows too probably. Even if I don't have to.
[22:41] <zequence> You can actually pay for those tests as a private person too. Costs a bit though. The two benefits of this education is, the tests are for free, and there's someone to ask when you can't understand what you're reading. Except, when you're having trouble with anything dealing with Linux
[22:42] <ttoine> zequence, but for Linux, there are planty of information on Internet
[22:43] <ttoine> and I hope you will read some stuff about Windows, there are some interessant things to learn
[22:44] <ttoine> at least, a lot of thing about what should not be done in IT to be productive and cost effective ;-)
[22:47] <ttoine> good night everybody. tomorrow, a brand new workstation start to produce music with Ubuntu and Mixbus...
