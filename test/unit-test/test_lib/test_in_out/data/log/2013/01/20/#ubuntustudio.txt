[05:49] <cfhowlett> clear
[09:30] <west> how do I save applications that are open so that when i restart they open up automatically.
[09:38] <zequence> west: There's ladish for audio applications. A gui tool for it is called Gladish
[09:39] <zequence> And for other type of stuff, there is some way of saving a session. Don't what tools though. Google on Xubuntu and you should find something
[09:39] <zequence> or xfce
[09:40] <west> thanks. will look.
[09:40] <Unit193> In the logout window, save session.
[10:33] <west> cool thanks. I saw it on log out.
[14:28] <spacediver> hi folks
[14:28] <spacediver> thanks for great distribution
[14:28] <smartboyhw> spacediver, :)
[14:28] <spacediver> while installing, I've decided to jump in for a chat ;)
[14:28] <spacediver> I have a decent lenovo t420 with core i7
[14:28] <spacediver> and expect to exploit it to the bones ;)
[14:29] <spacediver> it has 8 cores and 8 gigs of RAM
[14:29] <spacediver> could you hint me
[14:29] <spacediver> what latency of jack should i expect to work?
[14:29] <smartboyhw> spacediver, as we all say: -lowlatency :P
[14:30] <smartboyhw> However if you want to exploit it to the limits then maybe you need an RT kernel
[14:30] <spacediver> i'm now at live boot, and uname says it is lowlatency
[14:30] <spacediver> Linux ubuntu-studio 3.5.0-17-lowlatency
[14:30] <spacediver> I'm asking for you experience
[14:30] <smartboyhw> spacediver, quite ok
[14:31] <spacediver> I was testing it out of the box, and the results were quite strange: even at about 7-8 ms jack latency there were some xruns
[14:31] <smartboyhw> spacediver, should I bring out the kernel guy?;P
[14:31] <spacediver> nono :)
[14:31] <spacediver> and simple playing around with yoshimi (say, 10-20 notes at once) -- and qjackctl showed aboud 80-90% load
[14:32] <spacediver> ok, gotta reboot now, see ya folks, thanks for chat :)
[20:05] <sirriffsalot> I'm having some trouble booting the 12.10 version of your dist. from a USB-stick.. It works on another computer, but on this one I just don't understand what is wrong. There are many USB-[options] in my boot selection, but none of them are able to pick up the usb-stick except twice where it was a stroke of luck.. No idea what I did right. Any way of trouble shooting this further?
