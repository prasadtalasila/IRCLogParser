[22:16] <gladen> So, is it possible to view any lessons back afterwards?
[22:16] <pleia2> they're linked on the classroom site: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom
[22:17] <pleia2> if they haven't been linked yet, you can always look up the day on
[22:17] <pleia2> !logs
[22:17] <ClassBot> Logs for all classroom sessions that take place in #ubuntu-classroom can be found on http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/
[22:18] <gladen> Ah, alright thanks. Because I already saw some interesting classes that I am probably not going to make.. :P
[22:18] <pleia2> happens all the time :)
[23:33] <pg77> anyone before starting ubuntu development and considering options like python vs C++, qt etc?
[23:34] <JoseeAntonioR> pg77: UDW starts in 15:30 hours
[23:34] <pg77> i know :)
[23:34] <pg77> just wanted to ask
[23:35] <JoseeAntonioR> pg77: well, people should tend to just idle here, there will be mostly none until the event happens
[23:35] <pg77> ok thx
[23:35] <pg77> just checking ;)
