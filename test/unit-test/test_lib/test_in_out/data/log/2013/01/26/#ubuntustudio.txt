[00:51] <gwen_fifty-six> Good night! ;)
[04:22] <UnWorldly> is there a library that most of the plugins are using for their dsp functions like your oscillators and fft's and stuff?
[04:27] <kleanchap> I am thinking of using ubuntustudio. Is SELinux installed by default on this distro?
[04:29] <kleanchap> How much diskspace does a full install of ubuntustudio use?
[04:35] <UnWorldly> mine takes up about 100 gigs but its also full of music and software at this point
[04:35] <UnWorldly> no selinux
[13:57] <famax8> hey people
[13:57] <smartboyhw> Hello famax8 welcome back!
[13:57] <famax8> again havingthe same issue, ardour wont hear the line in - is connected with jack on
[13:57] <famax8> smartboyhw: hey man how are you?
[13:58] <smartboyhw> famax8, fine
[14:01] <famax8> so yeah ardour wont get any signal i plugged it in jack and all buit nothing some on the wave or even the signal
[14:10] <famax8> woudl knwo why is this? it workd last night very well
[14:11] <smartboyhw> famax8, weird. Did you try repeating steps and such?
[14:12] <famax8> yes
[14:12] <famax8> tried unplug replug save stopstart etc
[14:18] <famax8> im really disappointed by USt 12.10 - only issue so far, the most simple task is impossible and help is fairly poor online - i never had ot go to the forums so far but this time no way to do different ^^
[14:49] <famax8> ??????? aaalllooooooo???
[14:53] <len-1304> famax8, sorry I missed a lot of that.
[14:54] <len-1304> Just woke up.
[14:54] <famax8> len-1304: missed what?
[14:54] <famax8> oh right no problems - i was just wondering why the list of users is so big and nobody is talking today ^^
[14:54] <len-1304> Please remember there are very few of us and only on a volunteer basis.
[14:55] <len-1304> The way we work is that we leave the IRC open all the time so that if some one asks a question while we are not hear we can read it and respond when we are here.
[14:55] <famax8> i know but still over the 54 users ther must be people talking tho not necessarly doing support
[14:56] <smartboyhw> famax8, I really want to, but quite busy now
[14:56] <len-1304> I aslo think that some of the users listed don't remember that they are :)
[14:56] <famax8> but at least talking bs as usual
[14:56] <famax8> hahaha yeah i thought so
[14:56] <famax8> smartboyhw: u at work?
[14:56] <len-1304> There never seems to have been here
[14:57] <smartboyhw> famax8, no I am a 14-year-old student!
[15:00] <famax8> len-1304: hahahah
[15:01] <famax8> smartboyhw: wow and u know about your stuff alredy at 14 - good to see that i wasnt the only one lol
[15:01] <len-1304> Most of the talk is I have this problem... wait two minutes and vanish.
[15:01] <smartboyhw> famax8, what's your age then?:P
[15:32] <famax8> lol
[15:32] <famax8> me im 28 now
[15:32] <famax8> and i didnt vanish im trying to sort this thing out ^^
[15:33] <famax8> in order to post the solutoin here after so it helps others - isnt it what we are here for?
[15:33] <len-1304> Double then. And I am almost double that.
[15:33] <len-1304> Yup.
[15:33] <famax8> lmao
[15:34] <famax8> len-1304: u an oldies then haha if anyone start to take the piss about it tell them u nto old u an original lmao
[15:35] <len-1304> I learned audio as digital was just being introduced. The first Radio stations I working still used turntables.
[16:14] <famax8> lol
[16:14] <famax8> i use turntables as well when im mixing funk
[16:14] <famax8> and stuff like this
[16:14] <famax8> now i try to do it all on pc and live with my time
[17:12] <gwen_fifty-six> Hello! I'm french but I don't found a solution to my problem in the french documentation... I'm on Ubuntu Studio, and I can't use 2 screens in the same time because I have a shadow on my first monitor.... You can help me?If you have an idea, this is my mail box for topics, websites inscription and other.... Contact me! gwenel56 @ymail .com (remove spaces! ans this is y mail and not G mail!! :D)
[17:14] <holstein> gwen_fifty-six: i use arandr
[17:14] <holstein> http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/how-to-use-multiple-monitors-in-xubuntu.html is relevant, though i dont suggest updating XFCE
[17:14] <holstein> gwen_fifty-six: no one will likely email you, though you are welcome to join and post to the mailing list if you prefer emails
[17:15] <holstein> https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-Studio-users
[17:15] <holstein> i would elaborate as to what a 'shadow' is
[17:16] <holstein> if you mean, you are tring to set up dual head, and the screens are mirrored and not spanning, then try arandr
[17:16] <holstein> works for me... and the 2nd link talks about how to make those settings persistent
[17:20] <gwen_fifty-six> I use arandr too, but when I select VGA, my 2 screens are in fonction but in my netbook, i have a shadow in the middle of my screen, and this a 'degradé'... I can see all, this is just in the shadow... I haven't understand all you have say in my mail... Sorry...
[17:22] <holstein> gwen_fifty-six: i would try /join #xubuntu-fr
[17:22] <holstein> i dont understand what a "shadow" is, other than a hardware issue..
[17:24] <gwen_fifty-six> hum... the problem, this is when I start my computer, I have the shadow too...
[17:24] <gwen_fifty-six> Then, no programs are in fonction.....
[17:24] <holstein> gwen_fifty-six: i dont understand what a "shadow" is
[17:25] <gwen_fifty-six> (I hope you understand what I say...)
[17:25] <holstein> gwen_fifty-six: i know what a shadow is to me.. its a dark place
[17:25] <gwen_fifty-six> I don't know too!
[17:25] <holstein> if you have a hardware issue, then software will not fix it
[17:25] <holstein> otherwise, feel free to take pictures and/or screenshots
[17:26] <gwen_fifty-six> I send to you screen shots if you are here tonight... I'm not with my other screen...
[17:27] <holstein> gwen_fifty-six: you should go to that french-speaking xubuntu support channel when you are ready to solve your issue
[17:27] <gwen_fifty-six> Xubuntu is on XCFE too?
[17:28] <gwen_fifty-six> Xubuntu is with XCFE too?
[17:28] <gwen_fifty-six> *
[17:28] <gwen_fifty-six> Thank you!
[17:29] <gwen_fifty-six> See you! ;)
[20:16] <whoo> ‌ #snowlinux
[20:30] <leebtron> A question that may be better for a different channel, but I'm asking it here because it involves UStudio, and UStuddio has been primarily the cause of the issue - I've been having difficulties with keeping the installatino functional, and not interfering with my other OS, Slackware-14
[20:31] <leebtron> I've had unusual things, random errors start to occur after updating UStudio, and have had random malfunctions happen after UStudio overwrites my standard bootloader LILO on my Slack OS
[20:32] <leebtron> and do I need to use the UStudio session login for my audio apps to operate correctly?
[20:35] <len-1304> There are some loaded questions.
[20:36] <len-1304> Yes ubuntu (of any kind, probably any debian based distro) will over write LILO if you tell the install to put it's loader in the same place as LILO was.
[20:36] <holstein> i would just have slack as the main, and let it boot ubuntustudio
[20:37] <holstein> you can always install on separate drives
[20:37] <len-1304> The grub install does try to set itself up so it can boot any OS it finds on the disks.
[20:37] <holstein> you can even unhook the cables, if you are worried about it
[20:37] <holstein> yeah, grub is made to take over
[20:37] <holstein> and you are asking it to
[20:37] <holstein> if you dont want it to, dont use it
[20:38] <len-1304> When installing, It is possible to set grub up to install on the partition you are installing to, but that is not default, you have to select that manually.
[20:39] <holstein> you dont have to use grub at all
[20:39] <holstein> when i have multiple ubuntustduio installs for testing, i dont reinstall grub.. i'll have one "main" one, and i'll install, and go back to main and run "sudo update-grub"
[20:40] <len-1304> oops...
[20:45] <leebtron2> apologies, timedout. how do I review the logs, please?
[20:48] <holstein> leebtron2: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1573917/ i'll just put it in a pastie
[20:48] <leebtron2> thanks a bunch holstein
[20:49] <holstein> leebtron2: np :)
[20:54] <leebtron2> I am running a system76 laptop (GAZP8) i7  quad-core, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD which I have partitioned like so - 'top' of drive down: /dev/sda1 - 256 MB ext2 for /boot; /dev/sda2 8GB swap; /dev/sda5 16GB ext4 'slackware root'; /dev/sda6 ext4 'UStusdio root'; /dev/sda7 ext3 '/home' shared across both distros.
[20:55] <leebtron2> when it was running the smoothest, I had Slack as my primary OS, and LILO as my primary BootLoader, and chainloaded to GRUB2 which was installed on /dev/sda6.
[20:55] <holstein> sometimes i isolate... on different drives or whatever.. depends on how mission critical it is
[20:56] <holstein> i would just have one bootloader
[20:56] <leebtron2> but I've been slightly confuzzled by some of the packages descriptions in synaptic, and have botched the UStudio install, or certain aspects of it, and have had certain issues when trying to recorrect and/or reinstall.
[20:57] <leebtron2> my preference would be to have just one bootloader
[20:57] <leebtron2> preferablly LILO, but UStudio doesn't seemto like that, and I haven't been able to get slack to play nicely when only using GRUB.
[20:59] <leebtron2> I didn't mind chainloading grub, it kind of gave me a second oppoprtunity to go back to LILO/Slack, but I'd probably7l wind up setting GRUB2 to default to UStudio and not display the menu at all.
[21:01] <leebtron2> I'm an old linux guy, RH/fedora core 6, and started using slack around 12, 13.37, and now 14. TBH, the newer, 'user-friendly' distros have confusedme for a bit
[21:02] <leebtron2> i'm used to seeing a bit more of what's happening, and I don't completely understand what the system is doing in UStudio. How I botched the installs before were by installing packages through synaptic that wound up disabling key components of the system
[21:03] <leebtron2> I installed gnome-session, and one of the network applets would uninstall a key nwetworking componoent, and I couldn't get it back w/o a reinstall
[21:04] <leebtron2> i guess either synaptic didn't describe it thoroughly enough, or there was an additional tab or section i wasn't seeing before i clicked 'apply'
[21:05] <leebtron2> when i want to work with audio, do i need to use the 'UStudio' session from the login manager, or do the packages incorporate fully into the xfce and gnome-sessions if they're installed?
[21:06] <holstein> leebtron2: the packages are just that.. they work where ever
[21:07] <leebtron2> I ask because when i've been browsing synaptic from an 'XFCE' login session, some of the programs that I thought were default packages are not listed as installed.
[21:07] <leebtron2> that's what I thought.
[21:08] <leebtron2> can you tell me what then is the difference, exactly, from the differing sessions on the login screen?
[21:08] <holstein> nothing
[21:08] <leebtron2> like is it a startup configuration script or something?
[21:08] <holstein> look/feel
[21:08] <leebtron2> opkay, cool beans
[21:09] <leebtron2> when i've been going through trying to trim down the install, removing the asian languages i do not, and probably will not ever speak, as well as the SCIM input methods/anthy and all of that why some of the seemingly core UStudio meta packages seem to be dependent on their installation?
[21:10] <holstein> yup
[21:10] <holstein> leebtron2: i would say, you dont need ubuntustudio
[21:10] <holstein> you can use all this software in slackware
[21:10] <holstein> if you want ubuntustudio, i would use it more 'as-is'
[21:10] <leebtron2> I don't mind having spanish and german language support, but the asian stuff is more than i'd like
[21:10] <holstein> its not really designed for the uber-geek to load up and 'trim down' and trick ou
[21:11] <holstein> out*
[21:11] <holstein> you can, and are encouraged to, but it will be uncessarily challenging
[21:11] <holstein> and for what? 70kb's free on the hard drive?
[21:11] <holstein> this is production.. you will be creating large files
[21:11] <leebtron2> I am aware, and have installed and used many of the packages on my desktop in slack, but Ilike the default config of UStudio, and the low-latency kernel
[21:11] <leebtron2> gotcha
[21:12] <leebtron2> i thought they took up alot more than that
[21:12] <leebtron2> and TBH, it's been a very long time since i've had a HDD so small, which has made me a bit paranoid
[21:12] <holstein> i wouldnt worry til you need to
[21:12] <holstein> then, i would not run multiple OS's on it
[21:13] <holstein> i would slim down that way
[21:13] <holstein> you can mostly use all of our stuff from the live DVD
[21:13] <holstein> if space becomes an issue
[21:13] <holstein> ok.. gotta run.. good luck, and check out #opensourcemusicians ..we had a few slackware users in there
[21:13] <leebtron2> I'm usually on a HDD of 250GB plus for the OS, and I have a 3TB RAID 10 NAS unit for my main storage, and only keep around what i've actively working on
[21:14] <leebtron2> thanks for all the info and help holstein
[22:16] <xrs> whats up with me getting rolled from #ubuntu for using Ubuntu Studio?
[22:17] <xrs> was told im not allowed to ask support questions for USt in #ubuntu or #xubuntu
[22:29] <amarettox> hello
[22:29] <amarettox> I'm having some trouble using jack
[22:31] <xrs> im not experienced in supporting jack, if no one answers here you could try #jack
[22:31] <amarettox> oh i see, connect to #jack instead of #ubuntustudio ?
[22:33] <xrs> u dont have to leave, but thats the official channel of the jack project. theres people in here who know jack, but right now it seems every one is afk
[22:35] <amarettox> thanks man, ill give it a go
[22:36] <xrs> well that could have gone better....
