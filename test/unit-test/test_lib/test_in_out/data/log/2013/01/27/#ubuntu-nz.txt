[19:20] <snail> morning
[20:29] <ibeardslee> thumper: nice response to that that openchat email
[20:29] <thumper> ibeardslee: thanks, I tried to stay reasonable
[20:29] <ajmitch> morning
[20:30] <thumper> although I did have to laugh a bit about the bit where he said canonical could install a package to control your webcam and record you having sex to make porn movies for the amusement of canonical employees
[20:30] <thumper> I don't think any of us have time for that :)
[20:30] <ajmitch> where am I missing this entertaining mail?
[20:30] <thumper> ajmitch: nzoss-opencat
[20:30] <thumper> chat
[20:30] <thumper> windows 8 - a video something
[20:30] <thumper> turned into ubuntu bashing
[20:30] <ajmitch> sounds typical
[20:32] <ajmitch> I see the main person instigating that is a local
[20:33] <thumper> yep
[20:33] <ajmitch> you should sit down & have a chat with him after codecraft some time, it could be entertaining :)
[20:34] <thumper> yeah... or I might just end up getting angry
[20:34] <ajmitch> probably
[20:36] <ajmitch> just reading your reply now
[20:44] <mwhudson> morning
[20:56] <thumper> hi mwhudson
[21:17] <lifeless> mwhudson: sorry
[21:17] <mwhudson> lifeless: np
[21:18] <mwhudson> lifeless: i shouldn't reply to fb when cranky in the morning because a baby isn't sleeping
[21:18] <lifeless> mwhudson: that will be a while then :)
[21:19] <thumper> heh
[21:20] <mwhudson> lifeless: although right after i posted that, she went so sleep for so long that i was late into the office this morning so...
[21:45] <olly> it seems unlikely you could record *any* very useful video by turning on people's webcams
[21:46] <olly> you'd get a lot of footage of people staring at screens
[21:46] <olly> perhaps it'd work for a porn website for people turned on by ceilings
[21:46] <olly> or nose picking
[21:57] <thumper> olly: heh
[22:09] <ajmitch> thumper: ok, I see now that I should not read my dunlug email
[22:09] <thumper> :)
[22:10] <thumper> I unsubscribed from dunlug after the last lot of unty bashing
[22:10] <ajmitch> monday morning & I want a stiff drink
[22:10] <ajmitch> and I'm not a fan of a number of recent changes, but still...
[22:10] <lifeless> mwhudson: :)
[22:19] <mwhudson> olly: i was drinking coffee when i read that dammit
[22:22] <ibeardslee> there are a number of people with gripes about unity, on the whole it does the job for me.  And certainly the 'how dare someone monetise their work' comments are a bit arse. As are the "I'll go to distro $x" and Distro $x is built on Ubuntu
[22:23] <mwhudson> who was it who made the "that's it! i'm switching to arch" t-shirts?
[22:26] <ajmitch> ibeardslee: but it's ubuntu without the evil bit set that they're moving to
[22:32] <thumper> mwhudson: we should so get some of those printed
[22:33] <mwhudson> i think it was a bit of an omg ubuntu meme for a while
[22:33] <mwhudson> is omg ubuntu still a thing?
[22:34] <mwhudson> it seems to not have dns currently
[22:35] <mwhudson> ;; ANSWER SECTION:
[22:35] <mwhudson> origin.omgubuntu.co.uk.	29	IN	CNAME	origin.omgubuntu.co.uk.
[22:35] <mwhudson> UM
[22:38] <ajmitch> I'm not seeing a CNAME
[22:39] <ajmitch> just an A record also with a 30 sec TTL
[22:40] <mwhudson> yeah, it works now
[23:00] <olly> i think unity has suffered from being pushed into prime time too early
[23:00] <olly> people form an impression from when they first use something, and that tends to stick around
[23:02] <olly> it's a difficult choice, because pushing things out to the masses helps get a lot of people bashing away at them and shaking out issues
[23:02] <ajmitch> it might have worked out better to have it available but not the default desktop for a couple of releases, but that's in the past now
[23:03] <olly> it is for unity, though it's something to think about whether one can learn from
[23:03] <ajmitch> by the time precise rolled round unity was fairly usable, or people had learned to put up with it :)
[23:03] <mwhudson> how's wayland going heh heh
[23:05] <ajmitch> it'll be ready any day now
[23:07] <thumper> I have an answer to that, but I'm not allowed to say :)
[23:09] <ajmitch> whatever it is, people will complain
[23:10] <ajmitch> I think that's one thing we can be sure about :)
[23:11] <ibeardslee> on the whole people don't like change
[23:11] <olly> that's what you need to change
[23:12] <mwhudson> ibeardslee: but they don't like the current situation either!
[23:12] <mwhudson> so you have to change just the things _they_ care about
[23:12] <mwhudson> but everyone cares about different things
[23:13] <ajmitch> on the whole, people like to complain
[23:13] <mwhudson> +1 insightful
[23:15] <ibeardslee> mwhudson: the current situation is a change ;)
[23:15] <ibeardslee> but I think ajmitch does nail it
[23:15] <olly> on the plus side, if they're complaining, they probably actually care
[23:16] <olly> if you made a major change and there was no response, that'd not be a very good sign
[23:18] <mwhudson> this is true
[23:20] <ibeardslee> some of the LCA tweets seem to be covering the same thing (Bdale's keynote)
[23:21] <ibeardslee> https://twitter.com/henaredegan/status/295671279955099648
[23:21]  * thumper is missing LCA
[23:21] <thumper> ajmitch: you are there?
[23:22] <ajmitch> no I'm not
[23:22] <ibeardslee> although I think part of the difference is that "want it to work the way I used to use it"
[23:22]  * ibeardslee isn't there either
[23:23]  * mwhudson comes across a link to http://xkcd.com/178/, randomly
[23:45] <snail> i'd click that link, but i'm not really into pokemon...
