[06:12] <pitti> Good morning
[06:14] <pitti> desrt: the one commit we reverted that makes the "close last tab" crash go away is now causing the critical that we see in deja-dup's test
[06:15] <pitti> desrt: pythonpath> really? that seems to work for me, e. g. in jhbuild I get
[06:15] <pitti> $ PYTHON=python3 jhbuild run python3 -c 'import gi; print(gi._overridesdir)'
[06:15] <pitti> /home/martin-scratch/gnome/lib/python3.3/site-packages/gi/overrides
[06:16] <pitti> desrt: there is no "list", there's only one override dir per python version
[06:37] <robru> pitti, good morning! Thanks for merging my dbusmock stuff. we really needed that ;-)
[06:37] <pitti> hey robru, good morning
[06:37] <robru> pitti, just curious, when do you think dbusmock 0.4.0 will be officially released?
[06:37] <pitti> robru: my pleasure!
[06:38] <pitti> robru: fun thing, another Canonicalizen pinged me yesterday about the daily packages, and said "they are great, but they would be perfect with logging over D-BUS" :-)
[06:38] <robru> pitti, haha, great
[06:39] <pitti> robru: if you just need packages, you can always use the debs from https://code.launchpad.net/~pitti/+archive/daily-builds
[06:39] <pitti> robru: but if you need it as a build dep, I can release it this week still if it's urgent
[06:40] <robru> pitti, not urgent; I already backported the package for a PPA that we're using in quantal. just curious how long it will be before I can drop that backport and use an official package ;-)
[06:40] <pitti> robru: I want to work on some more g-s-d test cases this week, for that I'm probably going to need some more templates
[06:41] <pitti> so I think I'll release next week
[06:41] <robru> pitti, cool, no worries.
[06:41] <robru> pitti, take the time to make it great ;-)
[06:41] <pitti> heh
[06:41] <robru> pitti, I mean, it's already great, but you know what I mean ;-)
[06:42] <robru> don't rush it ;-)
[07:27] <jibel> good morning
[07:37] <robru> hey pitti, since I'm now trying to write a vala wrapper around this dbusmock api you just merged... do you have any guesses as to what the vala method signature definition would look like for a method that returns 'a(tsav)'? I'm quite new to Vala so I really don't have a clue here.
[07:40] <pitti> robru: hm, I'm afraid my Vala exercises have been quite a while ago, and I didn't get beyond a 50 liner :(
[07:40] <pitti> so not off the top of my head
[07:40] <robru> pitti, hehe, ok. I'm also much more comfortable with python ;-)
[07:41] <robru> pitti, but I'm trying to learn and I can't seem to find much documentation here ;-)
[07:41] <pitti> but for C, a() maps to a normal array, t to guint64, s to a normal string in vala; for av I'm not sure, how Vala maps variants
[07:41] <pitti> robru: I had expected that you'd use GDBus and that this just gives you a single Variant?
[07:41] <robru> pitti, not sure...
[07:42] <robru> pitti, I'm expanding some existing code that was written by kenvandine, and it seems he's made a new object that inherits directly from GLib.Object, and somehow this is able to make dbus calls...
[07:43] <robru> pitti, http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~super-friends/libfriends/trunk/view/head:/tests/vala/dbusmock.vala
[07:43] <pitti> wow, that is all? magic
[07:44] <pitti> seems Vala has GDBus built in then? nice
[07:44] <robru> pitti, so that I've already successfully expanded to cover ClearCalls, which is nice and easy with void return value, but yeah, I have no idea how to define the return value for this crazy a(tsav) thing
[07:44] <pitti> robru: I guess once you figured out how Vala represents multiple return values in general, it should be rather easy
[07:44] <robru> pitti, yes, vala is very magical, and it makes it somewhat difficult to learn :-(
[07:46] <robru> pitti, are you aware of any documentation for vala, specifically about return values? All I've been able to find is like 'string[]' or 'int[]' and those don't even begin to encompass this object...
[07:46] <pitti> I guess you can always start with directly calling the GDBus methods, like dbusmock.call_sync()
[07:46] <robru> pitti, I'm not familiar with call_sync
[07:47] <pitti> robru: standard glib API: http://developer.gnome.org/gio/2.26/GDBusProxy.html#g-dbus-proxy-call-sync
[07:47] <pitti> but that requires you to assemble and disassemble the GVariants yourself, so if vala provides some syntactic sugar around it it's certainly interesting to find out how that works
[07:50] <robru> pitti, I wonder if I could just say GVariant[]
[07:53] <robru> pitti, https://live.gnome.org/Vala/DBusServerSample comes close to giving a hint:  a(ii) maps to Foo[] where Foo might be defined as
[07:53] <robru> struct Foo { public int a; public int b };
[07:54] <pitti> oh, clever
[07:54] <robru> pitti, so it sounds like I need to make a struct of 'tsav'
[07:54] <robru> but what does 'av' map to?
[07:54] <robru> Variant[] I guess
[07:54] <pitti> right
[07:55] <pitti> so a struct Call { gint64, string, Variant[] }, and then let it return Call[] ?
[07:55] <robru> so: struct CallSignature { public int a; public string b; public Variant[] c } or something
[07:55] <robru> hehe
[07:55] <robru> pitti, ok, I'll play with this, and if I can get it to work I'll let you know (and also update that wiki...
[07:55] <pitti> ok, tuples mapping to structs makes perfect sense (that's what they are really)
[07:56] <robru> pitti, any thoughts on where that struct definition goes in the vala file? should it be in the class level, namespace level, or toplevel?
[07:56] <pitti> robru: I'd put it right above the d-bus interface definition, i. e. where you define GetCalls()
[07:56] <pitti> but it shouldn't matter much
[07:56] <robru> pitti, ok, thanks
[08:02] <pitti> robru: NB that it's really a guint64, not just int
[08:02] <pitti> 't', not 'i'
[08:06] <robru> pitti, valac tells me 'guint64' type name could not be found. maybe vala calls it something different?
[08:06] <pitti> http://references.valadoc.org/#!api=glib-2.0/uint64
[08:06] <pitti> robru: uint64
[08:06] <robru> pitti, ah, thanks
[08:07] <robru> pitti, ok, I seem to be getting somewhere... it almost compiles ;-)
[08:19] <robru> pitti, ok, so let's say I got this to compile and I'm able to get this Call struct from dbus... now how do I create a new instance of the struct with the expected values in order to compare it against the returned struct?
[08:19] <robru> pitti, basically, "how do I instantiate a struct"?
[08:19] <robru> ;-)
[08:20] <pitti> robru: the vala tutorial shows that, too
[08:20] <pitti> https://live.gnome.org/Vala/Tutorial#Structs
[08:20] <robru> pitti, thanks. Dunno why this isn't showing up on the googles.

[08:57] <Laney> are you waiting on some more changes there? I'd be happy to upload it otherwise ...
[09:01] <mvo> Laney: not waiting for anything else, go ahead with the upload if you want
[09:01] <Laney> great
[09:01] <Laney> mvo: university life treating you well?
[09:02] <chrisccoulson> hi Laney, Sweetshark, pitti
[09:02] <chrisccoulson> mvo! Hi :)
[09:02]  * pitti waves to chrisccoulson and mvo
[09:02] <Laney> ahoy there
[09:02] <pitti> hey Laney
[09:03]  * Laney sees snow is forecast all tomorrow and over the weekend
[09:03] <robru> pitti, ok, so this seems to be working, not just compiling but actually tests passing: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~robru/libfriends/dbusmock/revision/53
[09:03] <mvo> Laney: takes a bit to get used to it (again) but its a interessting change
[09:03] <mvo> hey chrisccoulson
[09:03] <mvo> and hey pitti
[09:03] <Sweetshark> chrisccoulson: good morning. Now we only need qengho to complete the fat apps crew.
[09:04] <pitti> robru: that looks beautiful!
[09:04] <pitti> robru: err, comparing raw hash values?
[09:04] <robru> pitti, well, it's littered with FIXME's, but other than that it's pretty slick I guess ;-)
[09:04] <pitti> robru: why not comparing strings?
[09:05] <robru> pitti, yeah, I dunno why, but if I compared the string value it would just fail. wouldn't say why, but the assertion would just fail
[09:05] <pitti> or variant types and values?
[09:05] <pitti> robru: well, it's a Variant, so you need to call .get_string() or .get_int() or whatever the argument type is
[09:06] <robru> pitti, I tried comparing variants to strings, I tried constructing string variants and comparing those, I tried extracting the string from the variant and comparing strings, just could *not* get it to compare equally. the hash value was all that would work
[09:06] <pitti> robru: what's the result of myvariant.get_string()? does that assert?
[09:06] <pitti> about wrong data type or so?

[09:08] <pitti> robru: get_string, not to_string :)
[09:08] <robru> d'oh!
[09:08] <pitti> http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.28/glib-GVariant.html
[09:08] <pitti> devhelp FTW
[09:09] <robru> pitti, ah, better. other objects in vala use to_string, so I was confused ;-)
[09:09] <pitti> robru: well, to_string is the Vala API; g_variant_get_string() is GLib
[09:09] <pitti> Vala is by and large just syntactic sugar around C and GLib
[09:10] <pitti> a lot of tasty sugar admittedly, but still
[09:15] <Laney> I think you can also cast to the appropriate type to dereference GVariants in vala too :-)
[09:15] <robru> pitti, yeah, the trick is that I have no background in C, so Vala is basically indecipherable magic to me. Too many layers of misdirection going on, totally inscrutable ;-)
[09:15] <robru> I'm sure for C programmers it's like the slickest thing.
[09:15] <pitti> Laney: oh, so you can do "(string) my_variant" ?
[09:15] <Laney> yeah
[09:15] <pitti> robru: oh my, yes
[09:15] <pitti> more sugar then :)
[09:19] <robru> pitti, ok, here's the overall diff here, cleaned up, with both GetCalls and ClearCalls in play: https://code.launchpad.net/~robru/libfriends/dbusmock/+merge/143649

[09:56] <pitti> Laney: I guess I'll drop the revert in svn and add that patch instead, and reupload?
[09:56] <pitti> that ought to fix déja-dup
[09:57] <Laney> yay
[09:57] <Laney> revert the revert and apply that sounds good to me
[10:00] <pitti> having to wait for all the autopkgtest to succeed makes the update take very long, but IMHO it's so worth it
[10:02] <Laney> yeah I look forward to the day when all the automation works seamlessly
[10:02] <pitti> it's also a nice system to prevent the temptation of "yeah, we'll fix it later"
[10:04] <pitti> Laney: pushed to svn, and glib2.0_2.35.4-0ubuntu3 uploaded; crossing fingers
