[06:03] <Rabblerouser> Hey, I'm new to Ubuntu.. and Linux as a whole. Was hoping I could get some help.
[06:04] <contrast> !ask
[06:04] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[06:04] <contrast> :)
[06:07] <Rabblerouser> I was just thinking.. (and it's many questons), what sort of overhead does Unity on Ubuntu have and is Kubuntu faster in that respect? Do Ubuntu apps work in Kubuntu? And is there a place I can go to sort of get a "test drive" of the layout?
[06:10] <contrast> Rabblerouser: Send me a PM so we don't flood the channel.
[06:12] <Rabblerouser> :S Not sure how to in this IRC client.. oh well.. Actually, I think someone else in a game channel might help me, though. Thanks and sorry for the bother.

[06:31] <phoenix_firebrd> hello everyone
[06:37] <contrast> Greetings, phoenix_firebrd
[06:40] <phoenix_firebrd> contrast: hi
[07:18] <Aknot> When i set computer to sleep it asks for password after coming back, how can i set it to automatically login? Ive set autologin this user but it only works if i reboot
[07:19] <deavelleye> have you tried searching trough the power options?
[07:19] <deavelleye> specifically screen savers and other such related options?
[07:20] <shadeslayer> it's under Advanced Settings > "Lock on Resume"
[07:20] <deavelleye> hello there guys & girls. wondering if anyone of you could help me, i've been having a small issue with steam over wine, specifically the fonts. whatever i do, i can't find a solution, tried googling it... still nothing using the guidelines they offer .  I would greatly appreciate if anyone of you guys could spare some time to have a chat about it
[07:20] <shadeslayer> install the native steam client?
[07:20] <deavelleye> i have
[07:20] <deavelleye> if you mean the linux one
[07:20] <shadeslayer> yes
[07:21] <deavelleye> but as i mentioned i would like to install the windows one
[07:21] <shadeslayer> why?
[07:21] <deavelleye> seeing as i would enjoy playing win games
[07:21] <deavelleye> or are they compatible using the linux client?
[07:21] <shadeslayer> I see, #wine maybe could help?
[07:21] <shadeslayer> no they are not
[07:21] <deavelleye> that's what i thought
[07:21] <shadeslayer> you only get games that have been ported to linux
[07:21] <deavelleye> thanks for the heads up
[07:21] <deavelleye> i'll go check it out
[07:21] <shadeslayer> for some definition of ported
[07:22] <deavelleye> ok so #wine => invite only
[07:22] <deavelleye> that's a shame
[07:22] <shadeslayer> errr
[07:22] <shadeslayer> sec
[07:22] <deavelleye> kk
[07:23] <shadeslayer> #winehq
[07:23] <shadeslayer> deavelleye: http://www.winehq.org/irc
[07:23] <deavelleye> right
[07:23] <deavelleye> should've thought of that
[07:23] <deavelleye> lol
[07:23] <deavelleye> thanks man
[07:23] <shadeslayer> :)
[07:23] <shadeslayer> np
[07:26] <deavelleye> they're all sleepy!
[07:26] <deavelleye> ahaha no wonder at 8 am ...
[07:27] <hateball> hmmm, isnt there something in winetricks to install fonts I wonder...
[07:27] <hateball> been many years since I used steam in wine, granted
[07:29] <shadeslayer> anyone here got a precise install?
[07:32] <shadeslayer> deavelleye: what do you want to know? :)
[07:32] <deavelleye> winetricks does not install fonts, as i can recall , i've already tried to wget them , but it doesn't install them already
[07:32] <deavelleye> VPN slayer
[07:33] <deavelleye> VPN
[07:33] <deavelleye> how does it work on linux
[07:33] <shadeslayer> depends on the kind of VPN you want to connect to
[07:33] <deavelleye> say, for example hamachi
[07:33] <deavelleye> pretty basic progam
[07:33] <shadeslayer> basically network manager has various VPN plugins
[07:33] <shadeslayer> and you have to install the plugin corresponding to the VPN you want to connect to
[07:34] <shadeslayer> I don't know alot about VPN's though
[07:34] <deavelleye> can i create a vpn network between win and linux?
[07:34] <shadeslayer> I have no idea :P
[07:34] <shadeslayer> !vpn
[07:34] <ubottu> For more information on vpn please refer to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VPN
[07:34] <deavelleye> thanks :D
[07:35] <deavelleye> uhm right. well that aside . what do i have to know about protection on kubuntu. rootwise and such?
[07:36] <deavelleye> is it, in your opinion, changing Su pw a bad idea? does it imply that many risks?
[07:36] <deavelleye> i've been reading a lot about it
[07:36] <deavelleye> opinions vary
[07:37] <shadeslayer> out of the box it's pretty secure
[07:37] <shadeslayer> just set a good password and enable ufw
[07:37] <deavelleye> first time hearing about ufw
[07:37] <deavelleye> nice
[07:38] <deavelleye> oh right, now that i think about it
[07:38] <shadeslayer> !ufw
[07:38] <ubottu> Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.
[07:39] <deavelleye> i've tried associating .APt protocol to firefox. exactly like they tell you to do it
[07:39] <shadeslayer> hm, iirc that should work out of the box no?
[07:40] <deavelleye> it should
[07:40] <deavelleye> but it doesn't...
[07:40] <shadeslayer> it does for me : libkfbapi.
[07:40] <shadeslayer> erm
[07:40] <deavelleye> still getting the .apt protocol association error
[07:40] <shadeslayer> do you have apturl-kde installed?
[07:40] <deavelleye> lemme check
[07:41] <shadeslayer> and what url are you passing?
[07:42] <deavelleye> i don't have the url atm , but i recall trying to open a wine .apt link
[07:42] <shadeslayer> 0.o
[07:42] <deavelleye> and yes i got apturl-kde installed
[07:42] <deavelleye> ...
[07:42] <shadeslayer> never heard of .apt links
[07:42] <shadeslayer> it's usually something like this : apt://firefox
[07:42] <deavelleye> that's what i'm talking about
[07:42] <shadeslayer> so if you click on that ^ it'll install firefox
[07:43] <deavelleye> i just missexplained myself
[07:43] <shadeslayer> :)
[07:43] <deavelleye> right
[07:43] <deavelleye> so
[07:43] <deavelleye> it works here
[07:43] <deavelleye> but not from firefox
[07:43] <deavelleye> ...
[07:43] <FloodBotK1> deavelleye: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[07:43] <shadeslayer> odd, works fine for me
[07:43] <shadeslayer> but then again, I'm on raring
[07:43] <deavelleye> tried creating new strings and bolean values to make it work. but it still doesn't ching
[07:44] <deavelleye> raring?
[07:44] <shadeslayer> yes, the next release, 13.04
[07:44] <contrast> deavelleye: You might consider installing firefox and firefox-kde from here - https://launchpad.net/~blue-shell/+archive/firefox-kde . That's always taken care of any weird Firefox/KDE issues for me.
[07:44] <deavelleye> thanks contrast!
[07:45] <contrast> deavelleye: If you can point me to a page that has apt:// links on it, I can make sure they're working in Firefox for me.
[07:45] <deavelleye> uhm llemme see
[07:45] <shadeslayer> actually those packages have a different set of patches, nothing to do with apt url handling
[07:46] <shadeslayer> note to self, I should update those packages, seems like there was an update
[07:46] <contrast> deavelleye: No problem. Just note that the version in that PPA is usually a little behind the official packages, so if you want to make sure Firefox is always installed from there (thus keeping KDE integration working)...
[07:47] <shadeslayer> or you could always poke me
[07:47] <deavelleye> i see
[07:47] <deavelleye> but now i can't find the link i was talking about !!! annoying
[07:49] <contrast> deavelleye: ...you'll want to add this to /etc/apt/preferences: http://pastebin.com/gDS0GU0q (just make a new file if it's not already there).
[07:50] <thechef> Is nvidia-current-updates in 12.04 not pointing to 310, because 1) it never will in 12.04, 2) nvidia doesn't declare 310 as stable-enough for LTS systems 3) still in testing 4) because 304 is still supported and for >304 version to appear in LTS 304 must first come to EOL 5) other?
[07:50] <deavelleye> it feels like xmass with all of you guys around
[07:52] <deavelleye> speaking of which, why are there 2 versions of nvidia experimental drivers on jokey?

[09:49] <sbivol> I see PySide is missing from Raring. known issue?
[09:49] <jMCg> shadeslayer: fairly certain. For instance: I was able to boot and run the LiveISO of Kubuntu amd64. Also, because I've been ALWAYS running amd64 distros on it
[09:50] <shadeslayer> okay
[09:50] <shadeslayer> sbivol: lemme check
[09:51] <jMCg> That, along with hints such as "lm" in /proc/cpuinfo flags. Etc.. all give off the vibe of, yes, this is, indeed a 64bit system.
[09:52] <sbivol> shadeslayer: the package name is „python3-pyside”. Last night I installed it on Quantal
[09:52] <shadeslayer> you are correct
[09:53] <shadeslayer> use PyQt4 for now?
[09:53] <shadeslayer> *blink*
[09:53] <shadeslayer> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyside/1.1.2-1
[09:53] <sbivol> shadeslayer: yeah, no problem with that, just that the docs for PySide are easier to understand for me
[09:53] <shadeslayer> heh how true
[09:53] <shadeslayer> not to mention PyQt4 has loads of missing stuff
[09:54] <shadeslayer> sbivol: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pyside/1.1.1-3
[09:55] <shadeslayer> yofel: ^ any ideas why apt just ignores that?
[09:55] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I'm confused. the packages have been built, but why are they missing from the list...
[09:55] <shadeslayer> even rmadison

[10:20] <sbivol> shadeslayer: python3-pyside.qtxml depends on python3 (<< 3.3), but python 3.3.0-2ubuntu8 is in Raring... something's not ok
[10:21] <shadeslayer> hm
[10:21] <shadeslayer> mparillo: not that I know of
[10:21] <shadeslayer> sbivol: I've asked ScottK to have a look
[10:21] <shadeslayer> since he did the sync
[10:22] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I'll try to apply a bit of --force to dpkg in the meantime
[10:22] <shadeslayer> nooooo
[10:22]  * sbivol blinks
[10:23] <shadeslayer> it's entirely possible that dpkg will trash your system if you do that
[10:23] <mparillo> shadeslayer: Thank you. If you do notice something after you apply updates, could you post it here or on the -devel IRC channel? Alas in my new day job it is harder for me to be active there, but I try to read the logs from home.
[10:24] <shadeslayer> mparillo: well all I can say for raring is that kubuntu didn't upload anything to change the font settings
[10:24] <shadeslayer> maybe the ubuntu folk uploaded a new fonts package?
[10:24] <sbivol> mparillo: I also install all updates, but nochanges to fonts on both Quantal and Raring
[10:29] <mparillo> sbivol: I agree, and I did not notice anything unusual in my system settings, but for some reason the fonts look a bit lighter and more spread-out.
[10:30] <sbivol> mparillo: system settings -> application appearance -> fonts -> Use antialiasing -> Enabled -> Configure ->  Slight
[10:31] <sbivol> choose either Slight or any other value that looks best on your monitor
[10:32] <mparillo> sbivol:  Thank you. I used to do that on Open SuSE, but I have always taken the Kubuntu defaults.
[10:32] <mparillo> Kubuntu FTW.
[10:34] <mparillo> I just had an idea...I can fire up my Xubuntu VM tonight, wait for updates and see if anything changes there also.

[11:01] <jMCg> shadeslayer: nah. Samsung 9x30a
[11:02] <shadeslayer> I see
[11:02] <shadeslayer> *possibly* the DVD doesn't have the signed bootloaders
[11:02] <shadeslayer> can you try the Kubuntu amd64 standard iso, failing that, the ubuntu amd64 ISO?
[11:03] <shadeslayer> I know for certain that the amd64 ubuntu ISO works with efi
[11:03] <shadeslayer> the Kubuntu one is suppossed to work
[11:03] <shadeslayer> everything else, no idea
[11:03] <invariant> jMCg, newer is not always better, so it appears.
[11:05] <shadeslayer> well since EFI is the future, it's good to have some testing done

[21:46] <Walzmyn> All of the sudden I'm getting error messages from Kontact which I can't trace and plasma-desktop has started randomly shutting down and i have to manually restart - is there a log or something where I can trace down what's causing these?
[21:53] <contrast> Walzmyn: You *might* find something useful in ~/.xsession-errors, but I wouldn't hold my breath. What kind of error messages is Kontact giving you?
[21:54] <Walzmyn> I don't remember until it gives me another one, but it's very non-specific. I don't even know which module is causing the error
[21:54] <Walzmyn> contrast: i had added two new calenders and thought they were the problem. But deleting them didn't make the messages go away.
[21:55] <contrast> Walzmyn: Which version of KDE are you using?
=== gunter is now known as Guest81861
[22:12] <Walzmyn> contrast: 9.5
[22:12] <Walzmyn> contrast: err, 4.9.5
[22:14] <contrast> Walzmyn: You could try upgrading to the 4.10 release candidate - sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:kubuntu-ppa/beta ; sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[22:15] <Walzmyn> contrast: meh, not really interested in being on a release candidate. I'll wait for it to go all official
[22:18] <contrast> Walzmyn: Understandable... The only other thing I could suggest, in lieu of any useful error messages, is starting with a clean KDE/Akonadi setup (moving ~/.kde*, ~/.local/share/akonadi and ~/.config/akonadi to a backup location so you can more them back in case it doesn't work).
[22:19] <Walzmyn> contrast: well, I'm hoping the next time it throws the error I won't be in desperate need of the computer and can google whatever it says.
[22:19] <Walzmyn> contrast: i do find it interesting that the plasma-desktop shutdowns started at the same time as the kontact errors
[22:21] <Torch> Walzmyn: might be the calendar trying to load stuff and crashing
[22:21] <contrast> Walzmyn: That could be relevant, but it could just be because the Digital Clock widget uses Akonadi.
[22:23] <Walzmyn> More: I just realized my desktop effects are not working and they won't enable when I try to either
[22:24] <contrast> Walzmyn: What brand video card are you using?
[22:25] <Walzmyn> ATI Radeon
[22:30] <L3top> Walzmyn: lsb_release -sc
[22:31] <Walzmyn> L3top: huh?
[22:31] <L3top> in a terminal... please type lsb_release -sc
[22:31] <L3top> and paste the result here
[22:31] <L3top> or reproduce if it is easier.
[22:32] <L3top> also: lspci -nn | grep VGA
[22:33] <ado> ciao a tutti.. c'è un modo per velocizzare il pc? ho ubuntu.. tipo pensavo un deframmenta.. o simile?
[22:33] <Walzmyn> precise
[22:33] <L3top> k... and the second?
[22:34] <L3top> If you are reproducing... I want the numbers
[22:34] <Walzmyn> L3top: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Barts PRO [ATI Radeon HD 6800 Series] [1002:6739]
[22:34] <L3top> brilliant.... now apt-cache policy fglrx | grep stall
[22:35] <Walzmyn> L3top: none
[22:36] <L3top> Walzmyn: the native radeon driver, while free which I love, is one of the few I install the proprietary driver.
[22:36] <L3top> *instead of
[22:36] <L3top> If I were you, I would sudo apt-get install fglrx
[22:36] <L3top> and exit your desktop, and re-enter.
[22:36] <Walzmyn> so I'm not running on the propreitary driver? I installed it. L3top
[22:37] <L3top> the proprietary driver is fglrx
[22:37] <Walzmyn> L3top: yeah, when I built the comtpuer the first thing I did was install the proprietary driver
[22:38] <L3top> Not sure what has occurred... however it is not installed currently
[22:38] <Walzmyn> *grumble*
[22:38] <L3top> apt-cache policy fglrx   will show the candidate, and the installed version... which is none
[22:39] <Walzmyn> what's the difference between the FGLRX driver and the FGLRX (post-release updates) dirver?
[22:41] <L3top> fglrx-updates is the "bleeding edge" driver made into the repo... it is still not likely ever the most current... but fglrx is stable. For fun, apt-cache policy fglrx-updates | grep stall
[22:41] <L3top> For your GPU I would just roll with the stable driver... unless I encountered a problem
[22:43] <Walzmyn> L3top: i'm trying to remember, but it seems like I did and had to change to the updates driver. Been a bit, this is the kinda thing I do once and forget
[22:43] <L3top> linux GPU/audio is the focus of what I do. I would not expect you to find any gain in the updated driver for a 6xxx series chipset.
[22:43] <L3top> again... to see... apt-cache policy fglrx-updates | grep stall
[22:44] <Walzmyn> Oh there's nothing installed, i'm looking at the gui gizmo
[22:45] <L3top> the power of the darkside is in the terminal
[22:46] <L3top> open a cli...
[22:46] <L3top> Now witness the firepower of this fully ARMED and OPERATIONAL battle station!
[22:46] <Walzmyn> I know, but while I was trying to follow you around the man page to see what "policy" did, I pulled his up really fast
[22:47] <L3top> Feel free to ask what things do. Not that a stranger should be trusted, but I will happily explain.
[22:47] <L3top> If I told you something terrible, someone in chan would alert you.
[22:47] <Walzmyn> *shrug* that's what man pages are for :)
[22:49] <Walzmyn> L3top: thanks for the help. I'ma move toward supper now.
[22:49] <L3top> preaching to the choir... normally you have to pull teeth to get folks to read the man... you will find no argument here
[22:49] <L3top> enjoy
