[01:32] <darkxst> jbicha, my monitors are going to sleep after ~5secs of inactivity ;(
[01:52] <jbicha> darkxst: I don't think I did that ;)
[01:54] <jbicha> dconf dump /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/power/
[02:04] <darkxst> "idle-dim-time=10" is that seconds or minutes?
[02:08] <darkxst> not that it has any effect anyway
[02:10] <jbicha> are you using the ricotz ppa?
[02:14] <darkxst> I have xorg-edgers, ricotz testing/staging and gnome3-staging
[02:15] <jbicha> ok I blame one of the first two ;)
[02:20] <darkxst> so essentially you blame ricotz then ;)
[02:21] <jbicha> well I don't have that problem on my computer and both of those ppa's are more bleeding edge
[02:22] <jbicha> actually the ricotz ppa's don't currently include g-s-d which would have been my first guess
[02:22] <jbicha> maybe the graphics drivers then?
[02:27] <darkxst> I guess, there was an update to nvidia package around the time it started happening
[14:44] <ricotz> darkxst, hi
[14:46] <ricotz> the wayland backend flags should only be added to the build of shared library of gtk
[14:47] <ricotz> jbicha, hi, ^?
[14:48] <jbicha> ricotz: hmm?
[14:49] <ricotz> jbicha, i guees, the udeb also will have the wayland dep too then
[17:01] <ricotz> darkxst, ah, i guess it mistaken you for Darxus :\
