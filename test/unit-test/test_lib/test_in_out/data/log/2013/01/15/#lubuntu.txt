[00:07] <Unit193> I'd guess that's more of a gpg key error, but not sure as I don't use LSC/USC. :P
[00:10] <xnox> wxl: universe is signed by the main archive key.
[00:10] <xnox> David23400: maybe you are trying to install update from some other place you don't know about.
[00:10] <xnox> from command line run $ apt-cache policy vlc
[00:10] <xnox> and read the whole output to see what's the highest version is tried to be installed and from where.
[00:10] <David23400> ok
[00:11] <xnox> then check if you have the key from that repository and it matches your expectations.
[00:13] <David23400> http://pastebin.com/qAe0jSUM here is the output
[00:16] <David23400> xnox: What i have to check exactly?
[00:16] <David23400> sorry i'm new on linux
[00:17] <xnox> David23400: please run apt-get update, the package version listed there are old see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/vlc
[00:17] <xnox> current vlc package version in precise is 2.0.5-0ubuntu0.12.04.1
[00:17] <David23400> how can i become root ?
[00:18] <xnox> please use official mirror like de.archive.ubuntu.com
[00:18] <xnox> David23400: if you are not administrator, please notify your administrator about out of date security updates.
[00:19] <David23400> just on the terminal i mean
[00:19] <Unit193> David23400: You would use "sudo action" for CLI apps, and "gksudo action" for GUI.  So, sudo apt-get update.
[00:21] <David23400> i think all the files is said to be  404 not found
[00:21] <David23400> how can i change the official mirror
[00:25] <Unit193> Synaptic or software sources may have it, I personally modify the sources.list file.
[00:25] <David23400> xnox: how can i use official mirror like de.archive.ubuntu. com
[00:26] <xnox> David23400: edit /etc/apt/sources.list
[00:28] <David23400> xnox:  opened the file, what i edit? what i add?
[00:29] <xnox> David23400: google for it. there are plenty of guides on askubuntu.com and help.ubuntu.com

[00:33] <David23400> thanks
[00:41] <roasted> hello!
[00:44] <Unit193> Howdy.
[00:44] <roasted> how's it going Unit193
[01:50] <roasted> hello!
[01:50] <roasted> I installed LXDE on Ubuntu 12.04. I'm having some difficulty automatically logging in. Can anybody think of why?
[01:50] <roasted> I edited /etc/lxdm/default.conf, but it made zero difference
[01:50] <roasted> I wonder if Ubuntu is interfering somehow since it's not a true vanilla Lubuntu
[01:51] <Unit193> roasted: Ubuntu doesn't use LXDM, and nither does Lubuntu.
[01:52] <roasted> oh, I guess the info I was reading was outdated then
[01:52] <roasted> My idea worked tho
[01:53] <roasted> I logged into Unity, went to system settings - user accounts, set to auto login, logged out, logged in to Lubuntu (since it'll auto log in to my last session automatically) then rebooted
[01:53] <roasted> went into lxde without issue
[01:53] <roasted> Unit193: was that the correct way? Or was there another way I was missing?
[01:59] <hpuser44551> Does Lubuntu support the fingerprint scanner on a Lenovo Thinkpad x61s notebook?
[01:59] <Unit193> roasted: I edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf
[02:00] <roasted> Unit193: what do you edit? I'm seeing two lines here and that's it
[02:01] <Unit193> roasted: /usr/share/doc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.gz has many, many examples.
[02:01] <roasted> :/
[02:01] <roasted> k, thanks anyway
[02:03] <hpuser44551> How can I read the hardware info (brand/manufacturer etc) for the fingerprint scanner.  Can't see it with lspci or dmidecode.
[02:03] <Unit193> hpuser44551: May be able to see it in lshw.
[02:09] <hpuser44551> can't see it. Not sure what it's listed as exactly.  I notice ubuntu has libpam-thinkfinger, but requires some configuration.
[02:11] <Unit193> libpam-fprintd - PAM module for fingerprint authentication trough fprintd
[02:13] <hpuser44551> thanks will write them down for future reference.
[02:13] <roasted> nice
[02:14] <roasted> I edited lightdm.conf
[02:14] <roasted> still didn't work
[02:14] <roasted> pretty awesome
[02:14] <Unit193> roasted: Is that the login manager you are using, did you change it?
[02:14] <roasted> I'm using lxde on ubuntu 12.04
[02:15] <roasted> switched it to lightdm-gtk-greeter
[02:15] <roasted> rebooting now
[02:16] <roasted> oh hey there unity
[02:16] <roasted> (still didn't work)
[02:16] <roasted> think I might just switch back
[02:17] <Unit193> Well, that's what works in Lubuntu.
[02:17] <roasted> not working here
[02:17] <roasted> ubuntu + lxde
[02:17] <roasted> the only way it owrks is if I log in to unity, set to auto login via gui, log out, log in lubuntu, reboot
[02:17] <roasted> then it's fine
[02:18] <roasted> perhaps I should just get a full lubuntu install on here and be done with it
[02:18] <roasted> only reason I put ubuntu on first then lxde is the fact that lubuntu comes with so little software
[02:18] <roasted> I know I can reinstall all that stuff but it just felt easier to ubuntu it + lxde
[02:19] <roasted> downloading the lubuntu torrent now, I'll give it a shot later
[02:21] <Unit193> roasted: Try tasksel lubuntu-desktop
[02:45] <Guest98604> Hi. Sound drops when loading Qjack (Lubuntu) and system needs reboot to get sound back...Any ideas??
[02:47] <Guest98604> Sound ok in Ubuntu Studio??
[02:47] <Guest98604> will programs like Qjack even work in Lubuntu?
[02:51] <Guest98604> Where are the 68?
[03:29] <holstein> Guest98604: do you need JACK?
[03:30] <holstein> personally, i disable the pulse to jack dbus
[03:42] <JDude> Hi I just installed Lubuntu, and none of my "special keys" are working. These are keys with visual cues like a computer or a calculator, and they are enabled by fn+some other key. I was looking through /home/username/.config/openbox/lubuntu-rc and I saw keybindings like 'XF86Calculator' and I was wondering if anyone here has ever had to change these key bindings to get them to work?
[03:42] <holstein> Guest98604: let me know how JACK works with lubuntu, did it pull in pulseaudio?
[03:43] <holstein> JDude: i usually deal with that as a hit in function for performance
[03:43] <holstein> JDude: sometimes, you can find packages for your specific hardare
[03:43] <holstein> JDude: sometimes, you can just specify them in the config file
[03:44] <holstein> JDude: i say, if its a deal breaker for you, consider something like xubuntu
[03:45] <JDude> holstein: it's not a deal breaker, but i'd love to get them set. this tiny laptop's trackpad is so damn small for my fingers haha
[03:46] <JDude> So I'm just probing for a response. If anyone else (whoever is active) has been able to edit these key bindings, I would love to know what you did.
[03:46] <holstein> JDude: i set them manually
[03:47] <holstein> it'll look a bit like this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1476937
[03:47] <JDude> holstein: how did you name the 'special keys'?
[03:47] <holstein> JDude: it really depends on the hardware AFAIK
[03:47] <holstein> http://forum.lxde.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=355&start=0
[03:48] <JDude> holstein: ah, thanks for those links! perfect. much appreciated.
[03:48] <JDude> holstein: now I just gotta google my laptop's keycodes.
[03:49] <holstein> JDude: i would do some tests on one, before you craft a giant text file
[03:50] <JDude> hostein: ok, thanks for help
[03:51] <JDude> holstein: also, have you noticed that it is possible to move desktops
[03:51] <JDude> holstein: to the left or right by scrolling
[03:51] <JDude> but i can only get that to work sometimes
[03:54] <holstein> JDude: thats one of the first things to go
[03:58] <holstein> the way im setup, i hold alt, and i can scroll through desktops
[14:58] <dyd> is there any way to have a transparent terminal in lubuntu?
[14:58] <dyd> with real transparency, not just to see the desktop  background
[18:41] <ioria> holstein: i don't know if you remember my problem with clementine but i think to have found the solution .
[18:44] <holstein> ioria: i had time to go back and install it later and it just worked fr me
[18:44] <holstein> for*
[18:45] <holstein> i dont remember your issue though
[18:45] <ioria> holstein: my problem was related to pulseaudio and my old sound card. i had to remove pulseaudio and add the alsa Gstreamer plugin
[18:46] <holstein> lubuntu doesnt ship with pulse
[18:47] <ioria> holstein: i had pulseaudio in my system ... maybe i messed up when i installed also gnome ?
[18:54] <holstein> ioria: not sure.. but pulse is not in lubuntu, but it was likely not the issue anyway, since i have pulse, and clementine worked fine
[18:56] <ioria> holstein: so, maybe my old hardware then ?
[18:58] <ioria> holstein: because now it works
[19:06] <holstein> ioria: i was thinking the codec
[19:06] <holstein> or, whatever gstreamer plugin
[19:07] <ioria> holstein: i installed only lubuntu-extras and w32codecs
[19:08] <holstein> ioria: that would do it
[19:08] <holstein> ioria: i already have those installed too.. and pulse
[19:09] <ioria> holstein: could be related to my hardware, then ?
[19:10] <holstein> ioria: sure. but its not likely.. its likey you needed a codec
[19:10] <holstein> ioria: you can test.. lubuntu live CD.. install clementine, play file... ubuntu live CD (or xubuntu) install clementine, play file
[19:10] <ioria> holstein: but gnome-mplayer and audacoius workede well
[19:10] <ioria> worked
[19:11] <holstein> ioria: cool.. then something about those particular gstreamer packages are *just* for clementine
[19:11] <holstein> ioria: or, you were using a different version of the file to test
[19:11] <ioria> holstein: i agree
[19:11] <holstein> ioria: could be lots of things, and i have *no* idea...
[19:11] <holstein> im not in front of it.. but i test with known good audio files
[19:12] <holstein> ioria: i literally apt-get installed it and it worked
[19:12] <ioria> holstein: btw, thanks fot the help
[19:12] <holstein> sure
[19:12] <holstein> thats what we are here for
[19:12] <ioria> :P
[21:26] <s1mon> Howdy
