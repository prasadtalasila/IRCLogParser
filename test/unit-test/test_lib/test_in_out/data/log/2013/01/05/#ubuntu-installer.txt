[14:31] <melodie> hello
[14:33] <melodie> I am coming to seek for help : I try to make a remix, using Ubuntu Mini Remix (not official version) and can't get better than that for the Ubiquity frontend gtk look : http://meets.free.fr/debian/images/ubiquity-frontend-gtk-look.png
[14:33] <melodie> I seek the web since 3 days, try to grep "background" into the ubiquity files in the install, compare with the ones in Lubuntu and still need help.
[14:34] <melodie> I found the chan while visiting this page : https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubiquity
[14:34] <melodie> can someone help me please ? :)
[14:36] <melodie> and... the related packages I installed : "ubiquity ubiquity-casper ubiquity-frontend-gtk ubiquity-ubuntu-artwork "
[14:51] <melodie> if someone can give me information, I'll read it soon.
[14:51] <melodie> bbl
