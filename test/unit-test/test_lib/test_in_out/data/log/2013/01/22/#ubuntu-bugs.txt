[06:01] <KlfJoat> I'm trying to figure out where to file a bug.  Can someone help point me in the right direction?
[06:02] <TheLordOfTime> KlfJoat, if its a bug in ubuntu, ubuntu-bug [package name]
[06:03] <TheLordOfTime> and i'm assuming it is since you're here :P
[06:03] <KlfJoat> My problem is figuring out which package.  The wiki says "anything hardware-related is kernel".  But I think my hardware is getting seen...
[06:03] <KlfJoat> Let me start toward the beginning.
[06:05] <KlfJoat> Scanner shows up in lsusb, shows up in /var/log/udev, but sane-find-scanner doesn't see it.
[06:06] <KlfJoat> So is the bug in libusb, udev, or sane?
[06:07] <TheLordOfTime> The wiki says "anything hardware-related is kernel".  <-- that usually means the 'linux' package
[06:07] <KlfJoat> (adding to the infuriation, it was PnP in 12.04 32-bit, but I'm having problems on a fresh 12.10 64-bit install)
[06:08] <TheLordOfTime> but i'm not an expert in those package areas, so i would be going by what the wiki says
[06:08] <TheLordOfTime> its also 01:00 and i have to be up in 6 hours so i'm headed off, sorry that i'm just leaving randomly :P[
[06:08] <KlfJoat> That's fine.  I have to be up in 6 hours as well.  good night!  :-)

[19:09] <psusi> what package should dist upgrade failures be assigned to?
[19:25] <jtaylor> the package that causes the failure
[19:25] <jtaylor> which is normally the first which throws an error, don't bother filing bugs about the rest
[19:30] <psusi> great, 115 separate bugs got filed for the same broken upgrade
[19:31] <jtaylor> yes that happens sometimes :/
[19:31] <jtaylor> people just like clicking that report bug button until it disappears
[19:32] <jtaylor> but 115 times o_O
[19:33] <psusi> apport needs to realize when more than a handful of packages fail to upgrade, it doesn't need to file separate bug reports for them all
[19:34] <jtaylor> I guess you mean stefanos bug
[19:34] <jtaylor> perl failing on upgrade, nice, that breaks pretty much everything else
[19:35] <psusi> yea
[19:35] <jtaylor> hm lets see if how one dups bugs with launchpad lib
[19:36] <psusi> I had some fun the other night with everything being broken because of python's logging module was broken
[19:37] <psusi> *everything* seemed to be trying to use it via pyclean
[19:48] <jtaylor> hm someone is duping the bugs manually faster than I can figure out the launchpad api :)
[19:48] <jtaylor> I only have a list of the bugs, where is the stupid duplicate function :/
[19:48] <psusi> lol, that would be me
[19:49] <psusi> thank god I'll stop now before I lose my mind
[19:49] <jtaylor> found it :)
[19:56] <jtaylor> so its working,
[19:56] <jtaylor> lets hope it are the righ bugs :)
[19:56] <jibel> jtaylor, lp-set-dup from lptools can help you there
[19:57] <jtaylor> mh got the number down to 6 before it crashed :)
[19:57] <jtaylor> which was because it tried to dup the master bug to itself
[20:01] <jtaylor> jibel: thanks, would have been quicker, but I would have also missed out on my yearly laucnpadlib api lesson
[20:01]  * psusi wants to dust off his api script to mass close bugs on removed packages
[20:02] <jtaylor> the master bug is probably now among the top 10 of bugs with most dups :/
[20:06] <psusi> yea
