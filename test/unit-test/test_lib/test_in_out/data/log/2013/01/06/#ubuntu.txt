[00:00] <elena-IK> is there a screensaver that simply displays the current time? without 3d wiggling etc
[00:00] <sw> mesquka1: 12.10
[00:01] <HeLLy> k1l: I found the right info, is there anyway I could email it to ubuntu so Bolivia can be added to the list of mobile broadbands?
[00:01] <stercor> Do I want to use LVM?  It's the default...
[00:01] <mesquka1> sw: if you want to use 12.10, try this: http://www.traffictool.net/vmware/ubuntu1210t.zip
[00:02] <mesquka1> sw: but, 12.10 runs a bit slow in VMware
[00:02] <BlackWeb> I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 Server, & grub isnt automatically booting the selection, Which would be that big of a deal but I only have power, & Network cord attached to server, I've already tweaked with /etc/default/grub so that grub would have a hidden time out, But it seems that 50% of the time it still does that, Any Solutions? Or is 12.04 Not as Good?
[00:02] <sw> mesquka1: 12.04 is Gnome?
[00:03] <k1l> HeLLy: i dont know which program you use and where the data is stored.
[00:03] <trendynick> I alt-tabbed a lot in my listed open apps and sometimes they appear (still nothing in sidebar and not listed in alt-tab)
[00:03] <mesquka1> sw: 12.04 is unity
[00:03] <sw> mesquka1: So what would make 12.10 slower than 12.04?
[00:03] <mesquka1> sw: or what you could do is use 12.10 and install gnome
[00:04] <HeLLy> k1l: I am just using the stock network tools and I am on a 4G connection to :-)
[00:04] <mesquka1> sw: 12.04 has gnome
[00:04] <mesquka1> sw: whereas 12.10 locks you in unity
[00:04] <bekks> 12.04 has Unity, too.
[00:04] <sw> bekks: 00:03 < mesquka1> sw: 12.04 is unity
[00:04] <dfgas> how does it lock you into unity?
[00:05] <sw> mesquka1: It's not possible to bin unity in 12.10? Wow. I'll try 12.04 and see if that works ok on VMware then.
[00:05] <mesquka1> sw: you could manually install gnome, but it doesn't come pre-installed
[00:05] <dfgas> so you are not locked into unity then
[00:06] <sw> dfgas: I think that mesquka1 meant is that 12.04 has both as a choice, 12.10 doesn't, natively.
[00:06] <dfgas> ahh, ok
[00:06] <RU-XerYuS> Can anyone help me return to a previous kernel (one before 3.5.0-21-generic)?
[00:06] <sw> s/that/what
[00:06] <mesquka1> 12.04 has gnome preinstalled
[00:06] <dfgas> i know i am on 12.04 and i installed ghone shell
[00:06] <mesquka1> yes, sw's right
[00:07] <dfgas> i swapped out my bios on my cr-48 and put ubuntu natively on it without any chrome os
[00:07] <dfgas> :D
[00:07] <mesquka1> sw: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-gnome-desktop ubuntu-gnome-default-settings in terminal
[00:07] <mesquka1> that should do it
[00:07] <BlackWeb> Anyone know how to FORCE grub to load the Selection within the boot loader?
[00:08] <BlackWeb> Ubuntu 12.04 Server, Half of the time It just Hangs out on the Boot Menu & never Loads its
[00:08] <stercor> What's a GPT partition table and do I want it?  Do I even want LVM?
[00:08] <linxeh> stercor: maybe.
[00:09] <Tzunamii> BlackWeb: Tried to force the selection via the config-file and rewrite grub?
[00:09] <dr_willis> leave lvm alone then. ;-)
[00:09] <linxeh> stercor: GPT will become more common (if you have a Mac you want it). LVM, up to you. it makes it trivial to extend volumes later over multiple disks if you need to
[00:09] <stercor> linxeh: What are the considerations?

[00:09] <KsM> BlackWeb: I think you can change /etc/default/grub, it should be the first 2 lines. then run `sudo update-grub`
[00:10] <BlackWeb> I've tweaked with /etc/default/grub  - So that there was a timeout and I ran grub update and that still didnt seem to fix problem
[00:10] <linxeh> stercor: if you are new to this all, and dont know any better (and arent on a Mac) dont use GPT and dont use LVM.
=== seednode- is now known as seednode
[00:10] <linxeh> stercor: you will likely reinstall anyway before it becomes an issue for you (and there are other ways round most issues anyway)
[00:10] <stercor> Jordan_U: Good show!
[00:10] <sw> What's the most commonly used project/task management application for Linux?
[00:10] <BlackWeb> Its like it'll load 50% of the time but the rest its like good luck
[00:11] <KsM> BlackWeb: also, you could check out kexec, which allows you to switch kernels/reboot without having to even see grub. it just loads the kernel into the memory and continues from there
[00:11] <rypervenche> sw: The kernel?
[00:11] <stercor> linxeh: I'm re-installing now.
[00:11] <sw> rypervenche: What?
[00:11] <BlackWeb> kexec  so thats a package I need to install?
[00:11] <rypervenche> Oh, I misread your question. Sorry.
[00:12] <Jordan_U> BlackWeb: The problem is that /etc/init.d/grub-common isn't being run at boot for some reason, and so the recordfail flag isn't being cleared (which would normally indicate a failed boot).
[00:12] <mesquka1> sw: http://www.dotproject.net/ prbably
[00:12] <linxeh> stercor: :)
[00:12] <sw> mesquka1: 'Installation Failed: [Errno 5] Input/output error'.
[00:12] <mesquka1> sw: VMware?
[00:12] <sw> Jeez, a couple of years back you'd have Ubuntu downloaded and running in a VM within 5 minutes.
[00:12] <sw> mesquka1: Yes.
[00:12] <molqr> a box gets its ip via DHCP ... could i write a script that would scp a file containing the ip to a remote box on startup?
[00:12] <stercor> linxeh: Take the defaults?
[00:12] <BlackWeb> Jordan_U   is there a fix I can do?
[00:13] <mesquka1> sw: haha, I use virtualbox, so I can't realy help you any further, sorry
[00:13] <mesquka1> "Jeez, a couple of years back you'd have Ubuntu downloaded and running in a VM within 5 minutes." agreed
[00:13] <Jordan_U> BlackWeb: I would recommend adding "timeout=5" (without the quotes) to /etc/grub.d/40_custom (on a new line at the end). Then run "sudo update-grub". That will override the timeout from /etc/default/grub, and Ubuntu's code that disables timeout after a failed boot, and make grub have exactly a 5 second timeout no matter what.
[00:13] <linxeh> stercor: defaults are often a good choice (I go with defaults on Ubuntu installs generally) - you can always re-do it later. most of my machines are VMs with all the data on a NAS though, so its a bit easier for me
[00:14] <stercor> linxeh: It'll wipe the disk anyway, so what's the best option?
[00:14] <stercor> linxeh: That's my estimate. They know a whole lot more than I do...
[00:15] <BlackWeb> Alright I'll try that, cause Ya right now I have the timeout in /etc/default/grub  set to 1 second but I'll give your way a try and see if I still run into the same problem
[00:15] <BlackWeb> Thanks for the Help :)
[00:15] <linxeh> stercor: re GPT, it makes little difference. LVM is up to you - it is a bit harder to get your head around, but its a staple of bigger linux installations (ie most big systems use it)
[00:15] <mesquka1> sw: well, im going afk for awhile
[00:15] <linxeh> stercor: I use LVM, but dont use GPT at this stage
[00:16] <sw> mesquka1: Thanks a lot, appreciated.
[00:16] <mesquka1> well, maybe not, ill stay awhile

[00:26] <codephobic> can anyone help/advise?

[00:29] <BluesKaj> codephobic,^
[00:29] <jelllow> I'm not sure any idea how can check ?
[00:29] <MeanEYE> codephobic: you need plugin as well, not just JRE.
[00:30] <codephobic> ah, well I installed the jre from oracle but saw no mention of a plugin
[00:30] <MeanEYE> jelllow: Start gnome-disks and do a self-check.
[00:30] <codephobic> MeanEYE, what's the plugin I need?
[00:30] <MeanEYE> codephobic: first tell me how did you install.
[00:31] <codephobic> I've also got the JDK installed, as I'm using eclipse to learn java, so I have a working java setup on my machine, just not for the browsers.
[00:31] <codephobic> I unpacked the tar and placed it in /usr/lib/jre...
[00:32] <MeanEYE> codephobic: Ah, that seems to be the problem.
[00:32] <codephobic> oh?
[00:32] <codephobic> that's what they instruct.
[00:32] <codephobic> http://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.xml
[00:32] <MeanEYE> codephobic: For JRE yes. But plugins are located in firefox directory. My advice, use this: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html
[00:33] <codephobic> well, I'll give that a go.
[00:33] <MeanEYE> codephobic: that works 100%
[00:33] <codephobic> the only reason I went to download the jre was because the java tutorial webpage sent me there.
[00:33] <MeanEYE> codephobic: Yeah, well Oracle is not really good at writing documentation.
[00:33] <MeanEYE> codephobic: This PPA has 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8.
[00:33] <codephobic> MeanEYE, thanks, hopefully this works.
[00:34] <MeanEYE> codephobic: Okay, you are welcome.
[00:35] <iBurley> I have a rather odd question, and it may actually be a TeamSpeak issue, not a Linux issue
[00:36] <MeanEYE> iBurley: please ask, don't ask about asking.
[00:36] <jelllow> Games keep grabbing my keyboard and when they crash I have no way to recover other than reboot , Is there anyway I can stop games stealing keyboard input from X11 ?
[00:36] <iBurley> Alright, so my side mouse buttons work for going forward and back in my browser, but I can't set them as push to talk in TS3 on Ubuntu, but they work just fine on my Win7 partition
[00:37] <MeanEYE> iBurley: You probably need to bind them in your games. Generally speaking there's nothing preventing them from working. So if it doesn't work, then yes, issue is with TeamSpeak.
[00:38] <iBurley> alright
[00:38] <MeanEYE> jelllow: Hm, depends on a game and input library in question. Linux kernel has SysReq, so that might help you avoid restarting.
[00:38] <dalsgaard> Does anyone have experience with using Adobe Photoshop in Ubuntu?
[00:38] <codephobic> MeanEYE, thanks again! that was quick and painless!!
[00:38] <MeanEYE> iBurley: You might want to ask on askubuntu.com or forums if you don't find solution. But in my opinion it's best to contact developers. Often things like this sound harmless but are bugs.
[00:39] <MeanEYE> codephobic: You are welcome. Glad it works. :)
[00:39] <codephobic> :)
[00:39] <MeanEYE> dalsgaard: Through Wine?
[00:39] <dalsgaard> Aye. I've heard that it's really hard to do
[00:40] <dalsgaard> Not looking to do it right now, but I'd just like the lay of the land. :)
[00:40] <jelllow> MeanEYE: Is SysReq ctrl-alt + f1 keys that drop you in tty ?
[00:40] <MeanEYE> dalsgaard: Depending on version. You can see appdb.winehq.org for referrence. There are a lot of people testing that. Personally I don't use it but I was able to make CS2 work without a problem.
[00:40] <dalsgaard> I see, thanks.
[00:40] <MeanEYE> jelllow: No. Those are just terminals. Check u
[00:41] <MeanEYE> jelllow: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
[00:42] <MeanEYE> jelllow: basically it enables you to issue commands directly to linux kernel.
[00:44] <jelllow> MeanEYE: I've used them once before I think there is one that causes a kernel panic :P
[00:44] <MeanEYE> Well, doubt it causes panic. But it can do a lot fo things from force OOM killer to restart of graphical environment.
[00:45] <MeanEYE> jelllow: Am not sure what the problem is.
[00:45] <MeanEYE> Can you give more information.
[00:46] <sevenforall> Apparently GIMP is hanging. Is there any way to get it back up without having to restart it?
[00:46] <Brinson> Networking question for anyone out there who might can help me...my mom has satelite internet and the networking cable has been severed. Going to go out and try to fix it tomorrow. I've got a crimper but am going to need to pick up RJ45 connectors. No idea if the cable is cat5, cat5e, or cat6, will I need to buy specific RJ45 connectors or are they cross-compatible?
=== nexus is now known as Guest45869
[00:46] <MeanEYE> sevenforall: It shouldn't do that. If it's working something, leave it alone and it should get back. If it doesn't you might want to report a bug to gimp developer team.
[00:47] <joeb3_> Brinson, It's a standard ethernet cable. nothing special.
[00:47] <MeanEYE> Brinson: difference in cables is only in quality. CAT6 connectors have usually some metal (not only plastic). CAT6 cable has thicker wires.
[00:48] <MeanEYE> Brinson: So if you have cat6 cable, you'll probably need a bit different connector. But if you manage to squeze wires in, everything will work just normally.
[00:49] <Brinson> If I buy the cat6 ones there should be enough room for cat5 and cat5e in case its those, then?
[00:49] <MeanEYE> Brinson: yes.
[00:49] <MeanEYE> But connectors are cheap. And you only need one? So it's not a big investment.
[00:50] <Brinson> she lives like an hour from the closest store that sells them though so didn't want to get out there with one that wouldn't work.
[00:50] <MeanEYE> http://www.milehighautomation.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/cat53-vs-ca6.png
[00:50] <pppingme> if you terminate a cat5 connector or jack onto cat6 cabling, you've downgraded the whole thing to a cat5 install.
[00:50] <MeanEYE> That's the difference between cables.
[00:50] <MeanEYE> Cat6 has plastic inside.
[00:51] <sevenforall> MeanEYE: I didn't make any changes that are processing-heavy. I have a very decent PC that renders everything GIMP can do in less than a minute.
[00:52] <ErdMutter> I am looking for ways to improve security on Ubuntu 12.04. I have ufw setup, but I was wondering if anyone had some other suggestions xD
[00:52] <MeanEYE> sevenforall: In that case you should contact Gimp developers. And see what they have to say about it. It's not an OS issue.
[00:52] <MeanEYE> ErdMutter: Don't run scripts you download online. :D
[00:53] <MeanEYE> ErdMutter: that was a joke. :D :P In case I wasn't obvious. Do you have any reasont o be concerned about security.
[00:53] <ErdMutter> MeanEYE, Some of my old friends like to be 'jokers' sometimes.
[00:53] <MeanEYE> ErdMutter: And?
[00:54] <ErdMutter> MeanEYE, and I like to keep things as secure as possible xD ... not a bad habit to be in lol
[00:54] <dr_willis> read up on security basics and fundamentals. ;)
[00:55] <dr_willis> ufw may or may not make you any more secure. it depends on your setup
[00:55] <MeanEYE> ErdMutter: It's not, but considering Ubuntu doesn't have open ports by default and you are probably behind a router. Chances of someone doing somethign to your computer without having physical access are pretty slim.
[00:56] <ErdMutter> ok :) I guess I will continue reading more wiki articles on it then :D

[01:36] <MeanEYE> Overpriced*
[01:37] <MeanEYE> Ah, okay. That actually makes sense.
[01:37] <MeanEYE> Well, Macs have a weird, not-up-to-standard UEFI BIOS.

[01:45] <mesquka1> Eliz: go to #ubuntu-au-chat for awhile
[01:45] <root> halo ho to install driver make on backtrack
[01:45] <MeanEYE> realm174: For security reasons, make the share read only. :) Not that it matters, but it doesn't hurt.

[01:46] <Eliz> yawn
[01:46] <Riley88> hey guys is there anyway to turn of virtual desktops on 12.10 if your not using them
[01:47] <MeanEYE> Riley88: On Unity?
=== seednode_away is now known as seednode
[01:47] <Riley88> yea
[01:47] <realm174> MeanEYE: Yep, that's what I always do, unless there's a specific need to write to any share. But thanks for the tip nonetheless
[01:48] <MeanEYE> Riley88: Yes, but you need to edit some configuration. All in all, they don't take extra memory. So it might be best to just leave it. Not sure how Unity would handle different number.
[01:48] <Riley88> i was thinking it might save battery a little
[01:48] <MeanEYE> Riley88: Check this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/34572/how-can-i-reduce-or-increase-the-number-of-workspaces-in-unity
[01:48] <MeanEYE> Riley88: nothing to do with battery.
[01:49] <Riley88> oh
[01:49] <MeanEYE> Riley88: Batery is used by display, CPU, GPU, HDD stuff like that. RAM always uses the same amount of battery.
[01:49] <Muphrid> Riley88: is your touchpad working now?
[01:50] <Riley88> yea i switched back to 12.10
[01:50] <Riley88> were u the one helping me with that earlier
[01:50] <Muphrid> yes
[01:50] <MeanEYE> I wonder though, how much battery life you would get if you would use something other than Unity.
[01:50] <Riley88> i kept breaking x lol

[01:50] <Riley88> well arch and xfce i get around 4hrs of video playback
[01:51] <Riley88> unity on the 3.5 kernel i get about 3hrs 20
[01:51] <MeanEYE> Riley88: I meant, compiz is GPU intensive, as it uses GPU. Rendering stuff costs power.
[01:51] <Muphrid> I dont see any difference on mine
[01:51] <Riley88> the 3.5 kernel just kills my battery for some reason
[01:51] <MeanEYE> Maybe a regression.
[01:52] <Riley88> everything i have is intel pretty much
[01:52] <mysteriousdaren> Riley88: upgrade your kernel if possible or downgrade
[01:52] <Riley88> ive updated to 3.7 before but it made it worse
[01:52] <MeanEYE> Riley88: battery?
[01:52] <gavin__> hello
[01:53] <Riley88> hey
[01:53] <MeanEYE> gavin__: Hi!
[01:53] <Muphrid> Ahoy
[01:53] <Riley88> yea meaneye
[01:53] <MeanEYE> Riley88: did you try powertop? It will tell you what's using your battery.
[01:53] <gavin__> can anyone help me out? ubuntu keeps crashing, whenever i hover over the task bar, it starts crashing and same with the icons as well

[01:54] <gavin__> does anyone have a solution to my issue?
[01:54] <Riley88> nice gaven
[01:54] <Riley88> what is it
[01:54] <MeanEYE> gavin__: laptop?
[01:54] <gavin__> it is a desktop
[01:54] <MeanEYE> gavin__: which graphics card?
[01:54] <Muphrid> gavin__: radeon card?
[01:54] <gavin__> i don't have graphic card
[01:54] <El-E-Va-Tion> anybody here know how to create a sudo shortcut on the desktop in 12.10?
[01:55] <MeanEYE> gavin__: Hm, are you blind?
[01:55] <gavin__> MeanEye: i had this computer for about 5 years
[01:55] <gavin__> i don't have graphic cards in them and that is just plain rude
[01:55] <Eliz> i think he means an intergrate
[01:55] <Eliz> d card
[01:56] <MeanEYE> gavin__: I didn't mean to offend. I was wondering what setup you have. Unless you don't have monitors you really do have a card.
[01:56] <Riley88> like intel
[01:56] <Riley88> mines integrated
[01:56] <Riley88> hd 3000
[01:56] <MeanEYE> ATI and nVidia integrate cards.
[01:56] <gavin__> i have a monitor
[01:56] <gavin__> how do i check what graphic card i have?
[01:56] <Riley88> thats not what he means
[01:56] <MeanEYE> gavin__: Can you do a "lspci" command and give us the output?
[01:56] <gavin__> ok
[01:56] <MeanEYE> gavin__: Don't paste it here. use paste.ubuntu.com
[01:57] <gavin__> ok
[01:58] <gavin__> how do i close the first firefox browser that i opened?
[01:58] <MeanEYE> First?
[01:58] <gavin__> the web browser won't open
[01:58] <MeanEYE> Hm.
[01:58] <Muphrid> kill the process in gnome system monitor
[01:58] <MeanEYE> This really does sound like a driver issue.
[01:58] <MeanEYE> Let me check something.
[01:58] <Muphrid> or pkill firefox
[01:59] <MeanEYE> gavin__: Can you paste here what you get when you do "lspci | grep VGA"
[01:59] <Riley88> launch firefox from the terminal and see what it says
[02:00] <Muphrid> gavin__: paste only the line which starts with "VGA Compatible Controller"
[02:01] <acovrig> I have ubuntu 12 in a partition, can I resize it,add a new one setup lvm in the new partition, then move my current install into the lvm, then resize the lvm partition to the entire drive?
[02:01] <niki> Hi MeanEYE, are you still available
[02:02] <niki> my computer just shutdown by itself, not a powercut or anything
[02:02] <MeanEYE> niki: Yeah, for what? :D
[02:02] <MeanEYE> niki: Did you do a memory test?
[02:02] <niki> i couldnt computer shutdown by itself for no apparent reason
[02:02] <El-E-Va-Tion> thx, I figured it out anyway, just needed gksudo instead of sudo
[02:02] <El-E-Va-Tion> peace :) g'luck
[02:02] <niki> what was the command again that i required
[02:02] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Yes. It's not as simple as it sounds but it's possible. You can only resize if you have free space. Just so you know.
[02:02] <MeanEYE> niki: For memory test?
[02:03] <niki> think it was or something to do with driver
[02:03] <MeanEYE> niki: Sorry, I don't remember problems for long. So if you don't mind reminding me.

[02:04] <niki> MeanEYE: yea thats me
[02:04] <MeanEYE> Okay, :D
[02:04] <MeanEYE> niki: So command was "lspci | grep VGA"
[02:04] <niki> ok
[02:05] <MeanEYE> niki: that will list only display adapters.
[02:05] <MeanEYE> acovrig: I can't really guide you step by step as that's quite a complex problem to solve. GPartEd is your friend in this case. Also you need to run it from live session, as you can't resize mounted partitions.
[02:06] <niki> MeanEYE: here is what it says in the terminal lspci | grep VGA
[02:06] <niki> 00:0d.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation C61 [GeForce 6150SE nForce 430] (rev a2)
[02:06] <MeanEYE> niki: So you have nVidia graphics card. 6150. Did you install drivers?
[02:07] <niki> install drivers? you mean the motherboard?
[02:07] <MeanEYE> niki: No, nVidia proprietary drivers. I guess you didn't.
[02:07] <niki> I don't know how to do that
[02:07] <niki> are you able to guide me through?
[02:07] <MeanEYE> niki: Would you like to install them or stick with open source drivers?
[02:08] <MeanEYE> niki: Am pretty sure drivers are the problem here.
[02:08] <niki> whichever is the easiest?
[02:08] <MeanEYE> niki: Drivers are not hard to install. And process can be reverted.
[02:08] <niki> ok
[02:08] <niki> where can I get the drivers for it
[02:08] <MeanEYE> niki: to install use this command: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current nvidia-settings
[02:09] <MeanEYE> niki: Drivers are in Ubuntu repositories. :) So no need for finding them. Just one command away.
[02:09] <acovrig> MeanEYE: Hows this sound? sda1 is /, resize sda1, create sda2 (ext4?) run pvcreate; vgcreate; lvcreate; dd sda1 >(the logical volume) in sda2; make sda1 /boot and srink it.

[02:11] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Well it looks logical, but I have really limited experience with LVM. Am not sure I shoudl be the one giving you advices.
[02:11] <MeanEYE> should*
[02:11] <niki> MeanEYE: I think it has finished installing
[02:11] <niki> MeanEYE: what do i do next?
[02:11] <Muphrid> niki: reboot
[02:11] <acovrig> MeanEYE: I'm in a similar boat, but am told it's the best way to setup a xen guest.
[02:12] <niki> ok
[02:12] <acovrig> and I'm going for win7 in ubuntu 12
[02:12] <niki> I'll reboot now and see how it goes
[02:12] <niki> talk in a bit
[02:12] <Muphrid> :)
[02:12] <MeanEYE> niki: That was suspiciously fast.
[02:12] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Am not sure what's the state of Xen. Any reason to prefer it over kvm?
[02:14] <acovrig> MeanEYE: can kvm do directs 3d in win7 (I'm new to virtuelization: I got hardware that supports it last wk)?
[02:14] <acovrig> *virtualization
[02:15] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Hm. You want to play games from VM?
[02:15] <acovrig> possibly
[02:15] <acovrig> I'm more of a programmer, but would like to have the option
[02:15] <gavin__> hi MeanEYE: are you there?
[02:16] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Am not sure that's a good idea. To my knowledge none of the virtualization solutions provide 3D acceleration. At least not for gaming. They usually emulate generic display adapter. Games would require direct memory access and that's something no OS would expose to a client OS.
[02:16] <MeanEYE> gavin__: Yes.
[02:17] <gavin__> MeanEYE: the taskbar has stopped crashing now and same with the icons
[02:17] <gavin__> don't know if it will crash in the future
[02:17] <gavin__> but I think that sorted the issue out
[02:17] <MeanEYE> gavin__: Glad it solved your problem. I doubt it will crash in the future.
[02:17] <gavin__> thank you for your help
[02:18] <MeanEYE> gavin__: No problem. :D And sorry if I sounded offensive :P ... didn't mean to.
[02:18] <acovrig> MeanEYE: I know (tried vbox), but don't want to shut down ubuntu to dual boot windows (I have services in ubuntu I don't want to stop (apache/sshd,ect.)

[02:19] <OmegaX> I need to record my audio output into a ogg or mp3 file, how do i do this?
=== OmegaX is now known as ElectricPrism
[02:19] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Tough problem. To be honest am not sure how good Xen is for gaming.
[02:21] <acovrig> MeanEYE:  yea, as far as I've seen, xen is perfect for this, but the cpu has to support IOMMU and mine doesn't, so it's probably the same as the others
[02:21] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Quick search shows there might be something to it. But I've never played with it.
[02:21] <MeanEYE> May I ask which games? :D
[02:21] <acovrig> MeanEYE: xen or kvm?
[02:21] <acovrig> minecraft, portal
[02:22] <ElectricPrism> Can I pipe my audio output to an in channel so I can record it in Audacity?
[02:22] <MeanEYE> Minecraft is Linux native, and Portal 2 is comming to linux in less than a month.
[02:22] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Portal one is Wine compatible, because Valve is not a douche.
[02:23] <ElectricPrism> sweet
[02:23] <MeanEYE> ElectricPrism: Linux is quite flexible with sound, but for anything more exotic than standard use I'd suggest looking at Jack. That's audio daemon built for that stuff.
[02:23] <acovrig> I forgot about wine, last time I used it it was on a *small* sys so it wouldn't work so I guess I blamed wine when it was probably the sys specs.
[02:23] <MeanEYE> And that's pretty much all I can help with :D audio on Linux. :P
[02:23] <BWMerlin> I have been told that I need to "go to synaptic and fix broken drivers" but I don't actually know how to do that once I am in synaptic
[02:23] <cfhowlett> ElectricPrism: yes ... jack would be the cure, but I don't know how to configure what you want.
[02:23] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Wine has come a long way.

=== g_byers[Away] is now known as g_byers
[02:24] <ElectricPrism> MeanEYE: Do you know of any other games coming to linux soon? I've been dying for some stuff to buy on steam
[02:24] <MeanEYE> BWMerlin: You can do it from command line. No need for synaptic. But in Synaptic you have "Fix broken packages' item somewhere in menu.
[02:24] <acovrig> yea, also, someone mentioned wine for mac, afaik: there is no 'wine' for mac, but there is a commercial 'version' called crossover, that sound right?
[02:24] <MeanEYE> ElectricPrism: Steam is public beta now. I have some 40ish games on there. :D
[02:25] <ElectricPrism> =O
[02:25] <MeanEYE> ElectricPrism: TF2 is out, and works. That means Source engine is ported. So, we can expect Left 4 Dead (that already works but is still being tested), portal, counter strike and DotA 2.
[02:25] <BWMerlin> MeanEYE: I tried that but it didn't appear to work, I am trying to install  glx-alternative-nvidia but when I do I get the following error message "The following packages have unmet dependencies: glx-alternative-nvidia : Depends: glx-diversions (= 0.2.2) Depends: glx-alternative-mesa E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages."
[02:26] <MeanEYE> ElectricPrism: Serious Sam is out, and bunch of indie games. Trine is always nice to play. Bastion <3... hm what else. Torchlight. Legend of Grimrock <3 ah, so much fun.
[02:26] <ben__> hey
[02:27] <MeanEYE> BWMerlin: Hm. Did you add any PPA?
=== seednode is now known as seednode_away
[02:27] <ElectricPrism> MeanEYE: <3 Bastion as well, Ill look @ Legend
=== seednode_away is now known as seednode
[02:28] <BWMerlin> I am unsure, I am going to go with no
[02:28] <MeanEYE> ElectricPrism: Legend of Grimrock is a oldschool dungeon crawler with modern graphics. Really good RPG. But only if youa re into that stuff.
[02:28] <MeanEYE> BWMerlin: I would expect that as well. Can you run this command: sudo apt-get install -f
[02:29] <MeanEYE> acovrig: Hm, well Crossover is commercial, but Wine works good. Especially with games that have been developed by companies who know what they are doing.
[02:30] <acovrig> MeanEYE: have u heard of a mac version of wine?
[02:30] <acovrig> because someone asked about it and I couldn't find it

[03:00] <MeanEYE> j0b0x: gksu gedit
[03:00] <j0b0x> Thanks MeanEYE will check it out
[03:00] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: Am clueless here.
[03:01] <MeanEYE> j0b0x: gksu = sudo but for gui :D and yes you need to edit with superuser.
[03:01] <LZ2ILR> MeanEYE: thanks for giving it a go
[03:01] <LZ2ILR> anyone else want to try getting my network up?
[03:03] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: can you tell me the model of that wifi dongle?
[03:03] <dcope> anyone using ubuntu on a macbook? i can't find a working xorg.conf for the trackpad.
[03:03] <dcope> that mimics OS X's behavior
[03:03] <j0b0x> Great MeanEYE got it to work.
[03:03] <MeanEYE> j0b0x: Didn't have a single doubt in you. :D
[03:04] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: perhaps difference between working distro and Ubuntu is kernel version?
[03:04] <LZ2ILR> its a bare board with ralink chip rt3070L, i ripped it out the old tablet and soldered it to a usb lead, like i say it works on another board fine
[03:04] <j0b0x> Heh
[03:05] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: Not questioning the board, rather kernel version. It's possible and the only thing that comes to my mind.
=== redrocket is now known as redrocket[DEN]
[03:06] <LZ2ILR> how do i find the kernel version
[03:06] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: uname -a
[03:07] <tmacy> hello
[03:07] <Riley88> actually uname -r
[03:07] <MeanEYE> :D
[03:07] <MeanEYE> tmacy: hi.
[03:07] <Riley88> will have a smaller output
[03:07] <goddard> i got a sata to usb dock and it works kinda but it only recognizes one partition.
[03:07] <MeanEYE> I think his cognitive abilities are fine :P
[03:08] <LZ2ILR> -a gives linaro-alip 3.4.19+
[03:08] <LZ2ILR> thats a pretty new kernel
[03:08] <Riley88> not really
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest8905
[03:09] <Riley88> 3.4 is kind of old lol
[03:09] <MeanEYE> Considering there's a version every couple of months.. and latest is 3.8 :D
[03:09] <MeanEYE> Not really :P
[03:09] <revickulous2001> It's only a couple months old lol
[03:09] <LZ2ILR> i generally use 2.6
[03:10] <Riley88> eeesh
[03:10] <Riley88> how old is your hardware
[03:10] <Ben64> goddard: what are you using that it only shows one partition
[03:10] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: Not sure if kernel is the one to blame.
[03:10] <LZ2ILR> so if i dont have modules do i have to download on another machine and transfer via flash disk:
[03:11] <LZ2ILR> this is getting like windows!
[03:12] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: on board this dongle is working, is it the same board?
[03:12] <MeanEYE> And is it the same OS.
[03:13] <LZ2ILR> its working on imx233 machine with arch linux and also with my eeepc701 and puppy lucid
[03:14] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: can you check versions there?
[03:14] <LZ2ILR> the a13 boards often bundle with a similar rt wifi chip
[03:14] <LZ2ILR> versions of...?
[03:14] <MeanEYE> Kernel.
[03:14] <MeanEYE> Or they are not running Linux?
[03:15] <LZ2ILR> puppy pc is 2.6 but intel architecture,
[03:15] <MeanEYE> So it's not kernel.
[03:15] <LZ2ILR> wait 5 and i will fire up the other arm board and check
[03:15] <MeanEYE> Is the dongle connected to HUB or directly?
[03:16] <goddard> Ben64: its a BlacX Thermaltake
[03:16] <goddard> http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Thermaltake+-+SATA+Hard+Drive+Docking+Station+with+eSATA+and+USB+Connection/8990443.p;jsessionid=DD2FB2A13A55B367BAD4353B2775876D.bbolsp-app05-12?id=1218007083869&skuId=8990443&st=sata%20drive%20dock&cp=1&lp=2
[03:16] <Ben64> goddard: what program were you using though
[03:16] <goddard> Nautilus
[03:16] <Ben64> well theres your problem
[03:17] <goddard> oh?
[03:17] <Ben64> try "sudo fdisk -l" and it should show you all your partitions on it, or you could use gparted
[03:18] <LZ2ILR> MeanEYE: kernel 3.5 arch
[03:18] <Ben64> goddard: and in the future, check monoprice for stuff like that... http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=103&cp_id=10315&cs_id=1031502&p_id=5330&seq=1&format=2
[03:19] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: Is the dongle connected to USB directly or to hub?
=== yugnip_ is now known as CharlieBrown
[03:19] <goddard> Ben64: gparted can see the other partitions
[03:19] <goddard> they just aren't mounted
[03:20] <LZ2ILR> on the board it works with its via a hub (board has only one usb) on the a13 i tried both with and without hub
[03:20] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: I thought board might not be able to provide enough power for it. :/
[03:20] <MeanEYE> LZ2ILR: Weird. Well, am out of ideas.
[03:21] <MeanEYE> Maybe problem is simpler than it looks, and you only need a network manager to sort things out.
[03:21] <LZ2ILR> i thought of that, its a powered hub as well
[03:21] <LZ2ILR> im going to have to find out where i can download the module, or maybe i can copy it off the board that works
[03:21] <MeanEYE> For the record, 3.4 was released on 20th May 2012. :D
[03:22] <Ben64> you'd probably have to compile it
[03:23] <LZ2ILR> compile <shreek!!!>
[03:24] <LZ2ILR> give me dependencies, give me libs... compile my libs...
[03:24] <revickulous2001> MeanEYE: But 3.4.19 was released November 17th :P
[03:24] <MeanEYE> revickulous2001: It's a update release. :)
[03:24] <LZ2ILR> i wish i was released
[03:24] <Ben64> 3.4.24 was released December 17th :D
[03:25] <Ben64> hmm... why does 12.04 have 3.2
[03:26] <revickulous2001> Stability, I would assume.
[03:26] <MeanEYE> Yeah. GKH maintains a lot of kernel versions. :D
[03:26] <MeanEYE> Poor fella.
[03:27] <LZ2ILR> thanks for the help guys, im off to bed, its half 5, seeya another day
[03:27] <MeanEYE> Okay. Sorry for not helping. ;D
[03:28] <LZ2ILR> by eliminating some faults you will have helped a lot. night all
[03:31] <MeanEYE> Well, folks. Now you can witness Linux becomming a gaming platform.
[03:31] <Tmacy> why?
[03:32] <MeanEYE> Valve's electronic engineer said SteamBox is due in 2013.
[03:32] <MeanEYE> And it's running Linux.
[03:32] <MeanEYE> Love em or hate them, this is what brings attention to Linux.
[03:33] <Tmacy> linux is everywhere
[03:33] <revickulous2001> What is SteamBox?  A gaming console?
[03:33] <MeanEYE> Yeah, Valve's gaming console.
[03:35] <MeanEYE> Tmacy: it is everywhere, but this is what will pull desktop users to Linux. Which is great.
[03:36] <Tmacy> great!
[03:36] <MeanEYE> Just imagine.
[03:36] <MeanEYE> Every big publishing house will make games for Steam console, and we in Linux world get it.
[03:36] <MeanEYE> <3
[03:36] <MeanEYE> Valve gets great OS, for free. We get games and more users.
[03:38] <abby> time for lunch !
[03:40] <frozenlock> I'm trying to play stepmania on ubuntu, but my USB pad (input/js1) won't accept two opposing Dpad value. For example: L-R or U-D. Any suggestion on how to remap those?
[03:40] <Tmacy> i am a yang gay from china and this is my first time in xchat,so nice to meet you
[03:41] <cfhowlett> !ot
[03:41] <ubottu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[03:41] <MeanEYE> Tmacy: I think you got the wrong channel. :D This is not dating channel.
[03:42] <goddard> i need to mount a couple partitions
[03:42] <goddard> whats the easiest way to do that?
[03:42] <MeanEYE> goddard: Automount on startup or manually?
[03:43] <goddard> MeanEYE: i think i want to just manually mount it
[03:43] <MeanEYE> goddard: In that case you use mount command.
[03:44] <goddard> just "mount /dev/sdd2" ?
[03:44] <MeanEYE> goddard: If /dev/sdd2 is in fstab.
[03:45] <goddard> MeanEYE: whats fstab?
[03:45] <MeanEYE> goddard: if it's not it's like this: mount -t type /dev/sdd2 /target/directory
[03:45] <MeanEYE> goddard: fstab is a list mounts with options. Helps when you want to mount same thing many times.
[03:46] <goddard> MeanEYE: oh ok where do I find out if it is in fstab?
[03:46] <MeanEYE> goddard: fstab is a simple file located in /etc/fstab
[03:46] <MeanEYE> goddard: so you can "cat /etc/fstab"
[03:47] <goddard> oh doesn't look like it is in fstab
[03:47] <goddard> fstab is for my internal disk drives?
[03:47] <MeanEYE> goddard: It's used so you don't have to retype everything all the time.
[03:48] <MeanEYE> goddard: Also, things in there can be set to be auto-mounted.
[03:48] <goddard> ahh
[03:49] <MeanEYE> goddard: So if you want to mount something it doesn't need to be there. It's just a convenience.
[03:49] <goddard> MeanEYE: ahh ok
[03:49] <MeanEYE> Like a convenience. It does have a purpose. :D
[03:49] <MeanEYE> goddard: So which filesystem is that partition?
[03:50] <goddard> MeanEYE: it is ext4 i think
[03:50] <goddard> one is linux one is extended and the other is linux lvm
[03:51] <goddard> i can amount the entire disk or only one partition?
[03:51] <goddard> that is from sudo fdisk -l
[03:51] <MeanEYE> goddard: Linux always mounts by partition. So you can moutn the whole disk by mounting each.
[03:51] <goddard> MeanEYE: ahh ok
[03:52] <goddard> MeanEYE: if i write a shell script i can just have all these auto mounted by disk identifier?
[03:52] <MeanEYE> goddard: If you add partition in fstab, you can have it automounted without script.
[03:53] <MeanEYE> Want me to dig up fstab documentation?
[03:55] <goddard> MeanEYE: nah its alright bro
[03:55] <MeanEYE> Okay.
[03:55] <MeanEYE> Everything in Linux is quite easy and logical. (I think).
[03:56] <tsubaki> how do I fix tearing in mplayer and TF2, its not a DE specific problem too
[03:56] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Which graphics card?
[03:56] <goddard> MeanEYE: ya it makes sense just got this usb to sata dock today because one of my computers died
[03:56] <tsubaki> GTX 460se
[03:56] <tsubaki> I have tried the work around in compiz
[03:56] <tsubaki> and the nvidia settings
[03:56] <goddard> it only auto mounts the boot portion i think 255mb bit
[03:56] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: So you have proprietary drivers installed?
[03:57] <tsubaki> yes
[03:57] <tsubaki> 310
[03:57] <tsubaki> Its an issue in Gnome and Unity
[03:57] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Do you have v-sync off?
[03:57] <tsubaki> also Windows movement becames "laggy" at times
[03:57] <mesquka> hi
[03:58] <tsubaki> it happens with it on and off
[03:58] <cfhowlett> mesquka: greetings
[03:58] <tsubaki> becomes*
[03:59] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: v-sync on or off?
[03:59] <tsubaki> irrelevant, these issues happen regardless of what I have v-sync too
[03:59] <MeanEYE> Hm.'
[03:59] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Can you be specific which 310 drivers?
[04:00] <goddard> MeanEYE: how can i figure out what type of file system it is exactly ?
[04:00] <goddard> MeanEYE: it just says extended
[04:00] <MeanEYE> goddard: That's a partition type. They can be primary or extended.
[04:00] <goddard> oh
[04:01] <MeanEYE> goddard: You can let the system guess filesystem type.
[04:01] <tsubaki> "using Experimental Nvidia binary Xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library from nvidia-experimental-310(proprietary)
[04:01] <Transhumanist> How do I check what model of graphics card I am using?
[04:01] <tsubaki> system settings, detail
[04:01] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: So 310.14. Hm. Am using same, and no problems h ere.
[04:01] <goddard> MeanEYE: im trying to mount it and it is saying i must specify the filesystem type and i try using -t extended or Extended and it says unknown filesystem type
[04:01] <MeanEYE> Transhumanist: lspci should give more information.
[04:01] <tsubaki> yea,
[04:01] <tsubaki> I had these issues back in 11.10 too
[04:01] <MeanEYE> goddard: -t auto
[04:02] <tsubaki> 12.04 didn't have the windows issue tho
[04:02] <Transhumanist> Cheers guys. I found it in Software Sources -> Additional Drivers
[04:02] <tsubaki> and its some pretty extreme tearing
[04:02] <goddard> MeanEYE: no go
[04:03] <MeanEYE> goddard: Then try ext4
[04:03] <abby> @Tmacy...
[04:03] <MeanEYE> abby: out for lunch. :D
[04:03] <goddard> MeanEYE: what is lvm?
[04:03] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Hm, could the compiz be the one to blame?
[04:04] <abby> yes
[04:04] <tsubaki> It happens on Gnome shell too
[04:04] <MeanEYE> goddard: logical volume manager
[04:04] <tsubaki> the Windows movement is fine
[04:04] <tsubaki> but the tearing is still their
[04:04] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: shell uses opengl as well :/.
[04:04] <tsubaki> hmm
[04:04] <tsubaki> should I try a WM only?
[04:04] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: by tearing. What exactly do you experience?
[04:04] <mesquka> gnome could be using compiz
[04:04] <goddard> MeanEYE: http://pastebin.com/muFu5AZc
[04:05] <tsubaki> the top half of the screen has vertical lines
[04:05] <tsubaki> sorta
[04:05] <tsubaki> like that row (or rows) of pixels are off
[04:05] <tsubaki> to the side a bit
=== Albastos is now known as Albastos|off
[04:06] <goddard> MeanEYE: thats my fdisk -l
[04:07] <MeanEYE> goddard: You can't mound sdd2, you can though mount sdd5
[04:07] <goddard> oh ok
[04:07] <MeanEYE> goddard: sdd2 is just keeps information of other partitions inside of it.
[04:07] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Hm, is the card overclocked?
[04:08] <goddard> MeanEYE: mount: unknown filesystem type 'LVM2_member'
[04:08] <tsubaki> no, the clock is reset on boot and only set by evga percision on windows
=== Guest21123 is now known as Someguy123
[04:09] <MeanEYE> goddard: Do you have lvdisplay command installed?
[04:09] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Hm, sounds like a driver issue. Did you try installing others?
[04:09] <tsubaki> yes
[04:09] <tsubaki> same issue
[04:10] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Did any drivers work with that card?
[04:10] <tsubaki> all had the same tearing issue
[04:11] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Tried other distributions or versions?
[04:11] <tsubaki> Mint, same issue
[04:11] <tsubaki> OpenSUSE w/ nouveau worked well
[04:11] <tsubaki> nouveau is the worst for tearing on ubuntu
[04:11] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Mint is pretty much Ubuntu. And it's not strange Nouveau worked.
=== Albastos|off is now known as Albastos
[04:12] <MeanEYE> Did you try Swat PPA?
[04:12] <tsubaki> ?
[04:12] <goddard> MeanEYE: i installed lvm2
[04:13] <MeanEYE> goddard: what lvdisplay prints?
[04:13] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
[04:14] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: But be ware. They are latest and greatest in drivers.
=== kslater1 is now known as kslater
[04:14] <tsubaki> ok thanks
[04:14] <MeanEYE> You might not want that.
[04:14] <tsubaki> I know how to fix X
[04:14] <goddard> MeanEYE: http://pastebin.com/9BAyT7Sr
[04:14] <MeanEYE> Okay then. In that case I suggest giving it a shot.
[04:15] <tsubaki> whats the syntax for adding ppa's again?
[04:16] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: sudo apt-add-repository
[04:16] <Rosenzweig> Jacob1
[04:16] <Rosenzweig> Hey guys.
[04:16] <cfhowlett> Rosenzweig: greetings
[04:16] <Rosenzweig> So the Ubuntu Image is set to release in a few weeks.
[04:16] <Rosenzweig> Ubuntu Phone Image*
[04:16] <cfhowlett> !phone|Rosenzweig:
[04:16] <ubottu> Rosenzweig:: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[04:16] <Rosenzweig> I've been snooping for information to start developing apps for it but the best I can find out is using the Quickly Pythons tuff.
[04:17] <Rosenzweig> Oh.
[04:17] <MeanEYE> goddard: http://serverfault.com/questions/36569/how-to-mount-a-lvm-partition-on-ubuntu
[04:17] <tsubaki> qt
[04:17] <Rosenzweig> Discussino there.
[04:17] <MeanEYE> goddard: Take a look at that.
[04:17] <cfhowlett> Rosenzweig: yep.
[04:17] <tsubaki> build them with qt and the webapp stuff
[04:17] <Rosenzweig> Discussion*
[04:20] <tsubaki> ok MeanEYE I have added the PPA how do I install them?
[04:24] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Just update. And then upgrade.
=== g_byers is now known as g_byers[Away]
[04:24] <tsubaki> do I have to select a differnt? driver in software sources?
[04:24] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: sudo apt-get update
[04:25] <MeanEYE> Nope. They have the same name, and since they are newer version they will overwrite existing ones.
[04:25] <tsubaki> even if I have the 310 selected?
[04:25] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: Hm. In that case I think you should install nvidia-current
[04:25] <tsubaki> ok im installing current-updates
[04:26] <MeanEYE> That works I think.
=== hack is now known as megha
[04:27] <tsubaki> also some preferencial thing
[04:27] <tsubaki> how do I get notifications on my main monitor
[04:27] <tsubaki> they seem to default the to right
[04:27] <MeanEYE> With Unity
[04:27] <MeanEYE> ?
[04:27] <tsubaki> yes
[04:27] <MeanEYE> I don't think you can configure that.
[04:27] <tsubaki> thats dumb
[04:28] <MeanEYE> Ubuntu developers were really against any configurability of notifications.
[04:28] <tsubaki> well they need some control over placement
[04:28] <tsubaki> at least being able to chose the monitor
[04:28] <MeanEYE> Be happy multiple monitors are supported.
[04:28] <c00kee> anyone have success running ubuntu on google chromebook
[04:29] <tsubaki> they want to compete with windows, they should be able to support the most basic features it has
[04:29] <c00kee> having a wee bit trouble running virtualbox on chrubuntu
[04:29] <MeanEYE> tsubaki: I don't know what to say to that.
[04:29] <MeanEYE> c00kee: Is it ARM based?
[04:30] <c00kee> yes
[04:30] <MeanEYE> c00kee: Does VBox even support that?
[04:30] <c00kee> running  chrubuntu right now
[04:30] <michael_2> Compete with Windows?  Why would any Linux distro want to do that?  Completely different uses between the two operating systems.
[04:30] <c00kee> which is ubuntu 12.04
[04:30] <zivester> what is the network manager in xubuntu? I have two with indicators spinning, and I'm pretty sure I'm only suppose to have one
[04:30] <tsubaki> Ubuntu is a Desktop OS (mainly)
[04:30] <c00kee> for chromebooks only
[04:31] <tsubaki> its competing with all Desktop OSes
[04:31] <tsubaki> OS-X, Windows, etc
[04:32] <tsubaki> brb gona restart X
[04:32] <MeanEYE> zivester: nm-applet can be started more than once. Is it Ubuntu with Xfce installed?
[04:32] <tsubaki> wait need toupdate first
[04:32] <zivester> MeanEYE: it's xubuntu 12.10
[04:32] <kslater> I've managed to only have 1 app launcher on my twinview, dual monitor desktop, but I have two top status bars. Wondering how to turn one of them off now. 12.04.1 LTS
[04:33] <tsubaki> how much of a preformance do you take from using a second X screen for a second monitor?
[04:33] <MeanEYE> kslater: I don't think there's a way.
[04:33] <kslater> argh
[04:33] <kslater> Not that big of a deal I suppose
[04:33] <MeanEYE> kslater: Just to make it clear, by status bar you are thinking top panel?
[04:33] <kslater> my monitor setup isn't quite right yet anyway
[04:34] <kslater> sorry, I don't know the proper names (they've changed and I haven't?)
[04:34] <MeanEYE> Yup. Changed everything that could be changed.
[04:34] <kslater> ribbon across the top that shows the application menus
[04:35] <kslater> time, network, bluetooth, etc.
[04:35] <kslater> top panel works for me
[04:35] <MeanEYE> kslater: time, network and similar are called indicators.
[04:37] <kslater> another new name. I did learn that one the other night when I was looking for an item I had on my 10.10 top panel.
[04:38] <kslater> does the Unity Launcher have an official name?
[04:38] <MeanEYE> Launcher is the toolbar on the left.
[04:38] <tsubaki> Dash?
[04:38] <MeanEYE> Thing that popsup is dash
[04:38] <MeanEYE> And menu is HUD
[04:38] <MeanEYE> Go figure.
[04:38] <kslater> HUD is the menu. Aha
[04:39] <kslater> HUD pops up when you hit the Wxxxxxxws key
[04:39] <tsubaki> no thats the dash
[04:39] <MeanEYE> Just windows key, that's dash.
[04:39] <tsubaki> and its the super key or mod key
[04:39] <MeanEYE> Am gonna name buttons in my program -> pancakes.
[04:40] <TXRoadkill_> lol
[04:40] <kslater> super key, like that betterer than Windows key
[04:40] <TXRoadkill_> Yeah, I haven't got the hang of that either
[04:40] <TXRoadkill_> The whole HUD/Dash thing
[04:40] <tsubaki> Windows is awesome in my set up, it blue screens on shut down

[04:56] <Kaligary> Hey guys
[04:56] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: greetings
[04:56] <Kaligary> So I installed perspective and Lmms but niether of them run
[04:56] <Kaligary> any ideas?
[04:57] <excalibr> Hey anyone use wine from wine-team's ppa? Does windows app icon showing on your unity launcher?
[04:57] <Kaligary> I'm using ununbtu
[04:57] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: unbuntu?
[04:57] <Kaligary> Excalibr I use "play-on linus which has wine built and an configs. it for me"
[04:57] <Kaligary> Yes
[04:58] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: not ubuntu?
[04:58] <Kaligary> oh >_< Yea that I meant sorry
[04:58] <Kaligary> I've looked around online, but couldn't find any answers
[04:59] <Kaligary> Could it be that I'm using an older version?
[04:59] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: ok.  i'm familiar with lmms somewhat but what is perspective?
[04:59] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: and what version are you running?
[04:59] <Kaligary> It's a game, they made a build of it for linux and hold on I think it's 10.0.2
[05:00] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: confirm: lmms = linux multimedia studio?
[05:00] <Kaligary> Yes.
[05:00] <Kaligary> sorry it's 10.04 that I'm running
[05:01] <Kaligary> I picked it cause if I;m not mistaking it's the last version running gnome
[05:01] <Ben64> they all have gnome
[05:01] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: good to know ... ok, well, lmms is no longer installed by default for 12.04 the most current ubuntustudio
[05:01] <Kaligary> 12.2?
[05:01] <Ben64> there is no 12.2
[05:01] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: errr, the most current LTS ubuntustudio
[05:01] <Kaligary> 12.04..
[05:02] <subcool> Ok - so- someone please help me.
[05:02] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: 12.10 is the most recent ubuntu
[05:02] <subcool> Chrome keeps complaining about flash..
[05:02] <Ben64> yep, they all have gnome
[05:02] <subcool> how do i fix it
[05:02] <Kaligary> Sooo... I have to have 12.04 or later for it to run?
[05:02] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: does perspective require lmms?
[05:02] <Kaligary> Negative, it is it's own software
[05:03] <Ben64> Kaligary: try running lmms from the terminal
[05:03] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: ok and you need lmms for ... what then?
[05:03] <Kaligary> a quick looks http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6bXbZQuwaA&list=LLwc-b_g4T_bc4Dotyn1VFAA
[05:03] <Kaligary> Lmms to use and make music of coure
[05:03] <Kaligary> I used FL when I had Windows
[05:04] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: nice.  sadly, YT is blocked here in chiina.  that said, I think you might want to take a quick look at ubuntustudio?
[05:04] <Kaligary> Ben what are the difference bewteen 10.04 and 12.04+
[05:04] <Kaligary> ubuntostudio?
[05:04] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: yep.
[05:05] <Ben64> 2 years.... 12.04 comes with Unity by default
[05:05] <Tsubaki> Unity is good
[05:05] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: but on Ubuntustudio NO unit
[05:05] <Tsubaki> but slow
[05:05] <Kaligary> That's it?
[05:05] <Tsubaki> under the hood stuff
[05:05] <Kaligary> Also ben I tried via terminal
[05:05] <Kaligary> no good
[05:05] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: no.  take a look for yourself at www.ubuntustudio.com
[05:05] <cfhowlett> www.ubuntustudio.org
[05:05] <Ben64> "no good" doesn't really describe anything
[05:05] <Kaligary> oh ok.
[05:06] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: also see #ubuntustudio for general support
[05:06] <Kaligary> It brings up a window for it then terminates the window with out authorization
[05:06] <Kaligary> Ok thanks!
[05:06] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: note: US 12.04 doesn't ship with LMMS as the new lowlatency kernel is installed by default for US
[05:07] <Kaligary> I burn my own disc
[05:08] <acovrig> I copied an ubuntu install to another drive and now it won't mount / on boot
[05:08] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: US is too big for CD ... DVD or USB stick
[05:08] <zwirc> Hei
[05:08] <zwirc> Do i need to install any package to use Ajax in php? etc?
[05:08] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: but you might wish to try before you buy.  test it out in virtual box.  You've got a few more months of support left on 10.04 ...
[05:09] <goddard> I have a usb 3.0 external drive and it isn't recognized when I plug it into my USB 3 port only USB 2 port
[05:09] <Kaligary> Are you talking about ubuntu 10.04? I burnt a live cd and made it my default
[05:09] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: no I was talking about 12.04 ...
[05:09] <acovrig> I copied it with gparted (booted from usb), then grub-install and marked the partition bootable, when it boots, I get a mount error for / and the boot fails, why?
[05:09] <c00kee> anyone install chrubuntu on chromebook
[05:09] <Kaligary> What happens after support runs out?
[05:09] <zwirc> Do i need to install any package to use Ajax in php? etc? (ubuntu 12.04 LTS)
[05:10] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: no more updates ...
[05:10] <michael_2> zwirc: Package?  You need an apache server to develop and test on your computer.  But AJAX is just JavaScript.
[05:10] <Kaligary> I see..
[05:10] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: you can run your software, but NO updates means no updates ... including security updates ...
[05:11] <zwirc> michael_2 strange, some scrips do not work after i moved server and installed lamp
[05:11] <zwirc> does i need any lib packages or something?=
[05:11] <michael_2> zwirc: No.  LAMP is all you need.
[05:11] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: for a musician, US is very sweet ... a nice collection of multimedia and production tools.  Ardour is similar to FL
[05:12] <zwirc> michael_2 humm, strange that its not working then o.O
[05:12] <Kaligary> I guess I'll have to swap over to unbuntu 12.04 regardless. Also thanks I'll check that out
[05:12] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: last thought.  do a clean install not a distro upgrade.
[05:12] <michael_2> zwirc: Does any PHP code work for you?
[05:12] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: I love US.  Ask me if you need help with the basics
[05:12] <Kaligary> Alright, will do. Thanks for all your help. And I'll be sure to do that
[05:13] <zwirc> yeah
[05:13] <cfhowlett> Kaligary: have fun, be safe.
[05:13] <michael_2> zwirc: Have you tried testing your AJAX in multiple browsers?  Certain browsers are pickier than others when it comes to coding conventions.
[05:13] <Kaligary> You to brother
[05:14] <michael_2> zwirc: PHP is server-depending...Meaning you need a LAMP server or something like that.  But the JavaScript part is completely dependent on the web browser.
[05:15] <Martijn-NL> Hi zwirc - i think your website url has been changed. Maybe the virtualhost settings in your Apache2 config are different. For example your website references to http://www.example.com and in your config stays http://example.com
[05:15] <goddard> I have a usb 3.0 external drive and it isn't recognized when I plug it into my USB 3 port only USB 2 port
[05:16] <zwirc> worked earlier, but sure will try
[05:17] <Martijn-NL> My advice: use the Firebug extension on Firefox or Fiddler to detect dead ajax links on your website.
[05:19] <Martijn-NL> Another opportunity is that not all javascript files are copied to the new server...
[05:20] <acovrig> mountall: Filesystem could not be mounted: / at boot
[05:21] <zwirc> michael_2: the page does not update (like javascript missing something)
[05:21] <zwirc> I need to update page manual to see changes
[05:21] <goddard> zwirc: what is your poblem?
[05:21] <zwirc> on prev page it did update automatic
[05:21] <zwirc> goddard: think i miss one package for my web server
[05:21] <Martijn-NL> Did you read my advice, zwirc?
[05:23] <zwirc> sorry Martijn, testing now
[05:23] <goddard> zwirc: what is the error message or what isn't working
[05:23] <zwirc> ajax script that updates mysql tables
[05:24] <goddard> ajax updates mysql itself?
[05:24] <goddard> or with php or something?
[05:25] <Martijn-NL> He has problems with his website on a new installed / configured server, especially making AJAX-calls. I think: incorrect virtualhost settings, some files are not copied?
[05:26] <michael_2> zwirc: Do you keep your MySQL database access constants (login name, password, etc.) in a separate file?  If so, was the file successfully copied to the new server and in the right location?
[05:27] <zwirc> goddard php ye
[05:27] <zwirc> ajax is just refreshing page using javascript
[05:27] <zwirc> michael_2 yes it is, and updated info
[05:27] <Martijn-NL> With the Firebug extension on Firefox you  can detect a lot of problems with websites (clientside), but you can also recognise server problems - like missing files...
[05:28] <alex20032> Hi, when we invoke python, which version is it?
[05:28] <alex20032> I mean, the default python in ubuntu 12.10
[05:30] <michael_2> alex: 3.2 I think
[05:30] <Muphrid> python --version
[05:30] <Muphrid> will tell you
[05:31] <alex20032> well, its because currently i dont have a linux box near me
[05:31] <alex20032> And i was wondering which distro made the big switch
[05:31] <Martijn-NL> By missing PHP files PHP gives a clear error message (if error reporting is on) : error_reporting(E_ALL)
[05:31] <fr33zrhyt3m> hi
[05:31] <Muphrid> quantal (python): 	interactive high-level object-oriented language (default version)            2.7.3-0ubuntu7: amd64 i386
[05:31] <alex20032> Currently, i know that arch is officially using python 3.x as their default, #!bin/python pointing to python 3
[05:32] <fr33zrhyt3m> anyone know how to run game via wine on ubuntu 12.10
[05:32] <alex20032> quantal is 12.10?
[05:32] <Muphrid> yes
[05:32] <michael_2> alex: I'm pretty sure that Python 3.2 is included with 12.10.  But I can't promise that I'm right lol.
[05:32] <cfhowlett> !wine|fr33zrhyt3m:
[05:32] <ubottu> fr33zrhyt3m:: WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[05:32] <Muphrid> it is included
[05:32] <Muphrid> but you have to specify the version to invoke it
[05:32] <alex20032> well, i was not asking if included, but if default
[05:32] <michael_2> alex: Just use a ln command and set the default to what you want
[05:33] <fr33zrhyt3m> thx
[05:33] <alex20032> anyway, im sure in the next version (or the version after the next) will be 3
[05:33] <Muphrid> they still have apps to port before making it default
[05:33] <alex20032> no, changing the symlink will break lot of script if its not using 3.x as default
[05:35] <michael_2> alex: what's the difference between typing 'python' and 'python3.2' besides the three extra keystrokes?
[05:36] <zwirc> How to use the firebug o.O
[05:36] <michael_2> alex: Furthermore, you don't have to change the link.  Create a link to 3.2 in your development directory that is outside BASH's PATH variable.
[05:37] <michael_2> zwirc: Firebug is just a Firefox extension.  Just download it from their extensions site.
[05:37] <michael_2> zwirc: It's a good development resource.
[05:38] <cynixx3> pse
[05:38] <zwirc> ajax_rank.php?upgrade=VarmSvartKaffe 500 internal error
[05:38] <Martijn-NL> Did you read the firebug manual? Have a good look at : http://getfirebug.com/wiki/
[05:38] <Martijn-NL> Hope you will find what you need..
[05:38] <zwirc> do i need to install jquery ?
[05:38] <zwirc> is that standard?
[05:38] <michael_2> zwirc: if you use JQuery on your pages, you will need to import it on every page.
[05:39] <Martijn-NL> What are you meaning by installing JQuery? You need to reference / include to JQuery before you use it for your website...
[05:39] <islan> oh man
[05:39] <islan> last time I ran Ubuntu was around 8.04 I think -- what happened?
[05:40] <michael_2> islan: It's about 8 versions better now.  :D
[05:40] <cfhowlett> islan: details of what are trying to accomplish would be useful ...
[05:40] <zwirc> michael : the strange thing is that it work on the old site
[05:40] <islan> installing the latest nvidia drivers seemed a lot easier back then, for one
[05:41] <zwirc> can i check php extensions etc?
[05:41] <zwirc> with a ssh command?
[05:41] <zivester> anyone know what the <input type="file" /> dialog box is called under ubuntu/xfce ?  I'm trying to figure out why it autofills when i click "browse" in Chrome.. I'm pretty sure it's OS specific
[05:41] <islan> but this download manager is kinda nifty
[05:42] <michael_2> zwirc: what extensions are you referring to?
[05:42] <Martijn-NL> Another opportunity is to edit your PHP file and add the following command in the first line: error_reporting(E_ALL);
[05:42] <cfhowlett> Localization query: during installation, update files are sourced from the main ubuntu site, not the local mirrors.  Can the be set to local mirrors prior to installation?
[05:43] <zwirc> michael_2: thats what i wondering
[05:43] <Martijn-NL> This command displays PHP error. Notice: you need to remove this line if your website is in production environment!!!
[05:43] <zwirc> its a ajax jquery script that do not work after i just moved the server from location a to location b

[05:48] <arrrghhh> hey all.  can I add LVM to drives that are already partitioned / have data on them?
[05:49] <limikael> Kirax: this morning… :)
[05:49] <arrrghhh> or must I reformat/repartition for LVM...?
[05:49] <zwirc> ah, 7 in morning, have to sleep :/
[05:49] <zwirc> but tnx for help, will try with firebug tomorrow
[05:49] <zwirc> gn
[05:49] <limikael> the rooster woke me early today.. :)
[05:50] <Kirax> hehe. LVM?
[05:50] <limikael> logical volume manager?
[05:50] <nocturnal_> if i run 'mv [folder name] /' does that move that folder to the root?
[05:50] <limikael> ah
[05:50] <michael_2> Kirax: Uggg...Don't say LVM.  I'm still pissed over choosing a LVM filesystem.
[05:50] <arrrghhh> limikael, that's what lvm is
[05:51] <arrrghhh> michael_2, I don't even want to know...
[05:51] <nocturnal_> because i cant find the folder now
[05:51] <arrrghhh> nvm I don't want to risk it.
[05:51] <limikael> yes i saw that sorry…
[05:51] <michael_2> arrrghhh: Nothing too dramatic lol.  I just REALLY wanted to install ElementaryOS Luna today and it doesn't support LVM yet.  :P
[05:52] <michael_2> And I wasn't about to wipe my Ubuntu partition for a beta linux distro lol
[05:53] <Hwkiller> michael_2: if it uses up to date kernel and kernel utils, it supports LVM; you'd have to do it manually, but you could do it
[05:53] <arrrghhh> uhm... this is bad.  it looks like the ubuntu installer changed all my disk types from ext4 to lvm...
[05:53] <Kirax> Oh LVM is cool! Learnt something new already lol
[05:53] <arrrghhh> I didn't "finish" any of these changes...
[05:54] <kslater> is there a way in Settings->Sound to control which application is at the top of the list in the indicator for the top panel?
[05:54] <nocturnal_> if i run 'mv [folder name] /' does that move that folder to the root?
[05:54] <arrrghhh> nocturnal_, yes
[05:54] <michael_2> Hwkiller: I wasn't able to find any options in the installer that would allow me to be selective of what part of the partition I installed to.  It seemed to only want to allow me to install to my full sda2 partition.
[05:54] <Kirax> nocturnal_ don't forget the sudo infront of mv.
[05:54] <Vencent> preced sudo
[05:55] <nocturnal_> arrrghhh, Kirax: i did and now for some reason i have lost the file
[05:55] <nocturnal_> err folder
[05:55] <spobat> Is there an option for moving one window to another desktop (quickly) ?
[05:55] <arrrghhh> nocturnal_, why are you moving anything to /?
[05:56] <michael_2> spobat: Yes.  Hold in the super key (in unity) to get a reference chart of the commands.
[05:56] <kslater> I'd like to know if I can control spotify with my bluetooth headphones (Nokia BH-905i), specifically next track. Unfortunately Rhythmbox is at the top of the list and takes the input first.
[05:56] <nocturnal_> arrrghhh: i was in a hurry one day and was typing out a path to move the folder and i realized i was running late so i just moved it to / for later and i came back and cant find it
[05:56] <spobat> michael_2, what is the "super key" ?
[05:56] <michael_2> spobat: the windows key.
[05:57] <michael_2> spobat: Linux calls it the super key
[05:57] <spobat> okay
[05:57]  * kslater needs a super sticker to put over the logo from M$
[05:57] <michael_2> kslater: lol
[05:57] <dr_willis> they got those. ;)
[05:57] <spobat> :D
[05:57] <dr_willis> and litt'e tux penguins
[05:57] <arrrghhh> nocturnal_, have you tried using the "find" command?
[05:57] <Kirax> hehe. I already scratched off the made for windows stickers on all my pc's. That was a proud day for me.
[05:57] <topper4125> My superkey no longer has a win logo on it, replaced it with a penguin

[05:58] <spobat> yeah, thank you
[05:58] <cfhowlett> "powered by ubuntu" ... system 76 IIRC
[05:58] <nocturnal_> arrrghhh: yes. both for the folder name and for .jpg which was the filetype of the files inside the folder
[05:58] <kslater> I gave a musician a Think Geek monkey sticker the other day. Maybe someone will give me a sticker in return
[05:58] <kslater> Plan 9 would be a sweet choice, just for the arcaneness of it
[05:58] <arrrghhh> nocturnal_, I don't know what to tell you.  look at your bash_history
[05:59] <arrrghhh> perhaps you mv'd it to /dev/null
[05:59] <arrrghhh> lol
[05:59] <arrrghhh> so the ubuntu installer flipped all the flags on my hdd's from ext4 to lvm...
[06:00] <arrrghhh> no mkfs was sent I don't think... can I just change the flags back and be OK?
[06:00] <arrrghhh> ugh
[06:01] <Kirax> kslater, I have this awesome sticker I was saving for a new laptop. Its a monkey "downloading" to a toilet ^_^
[06:01] <michael_2> arrrghhh: Any particular reason you don't want a LVM?
[06:01] <arrrghhh> michael_2, I do.  But I have disks that are already formatted ext4 and now I'm worried my data is fubar...
[06:01] <kslater> lvm is bad-juju
[06:02] <kslater> lose 1 of the physical partitions in the lvm and you're hosed.
[06:02] <arrrghhh> kslater, that's nice...
[06:02] <Kirax> I just learned about lvm recently, any reason why you consider it 'bad-juju' kaslater?
[06:02] <dr_willis> weird that it changed their type to lvm
[06:02] <arrrghhh> dr_willis, pretty sure it was my user error
[06:03] <dr_willis> biggest danger to a system is the end user. ;)
[06:03] <arrrghhh> yep.
[06:03] <michael_2> arrrghhh: Don't feel so bad...Ubuntu does everything it can to coerce you into use LVM
[06:03] <dr_willis> cant say ive ever noticed it trying to get me to use lvm.
[06:03] <arrrghhh> dr_willis, I read a warning message the wrong way... derp.
[06:03] <kslater> I used to think it was the cat's pajamas, but the fatal flaw is that sure-to-be-encountered condition where you lose a part of the logical volume.
[06:03] <dr_willis> but i tend to partiton first.
[06:04] <arrrghhh> screw it.  i'm just going to fdisk and change the flags
[06:04] <arrrghhh> i'm pretty sure that's all it's done...
[06:04] <michael_2> dr_willis: If you partition first then you'll be ok.  If you use the Ubuntu installer to partition...Those sneaky b'tards hide LVM in the filesystem type
[06:05] <dr_willis> sant say ive ever noticed the auto partioned doing more then a / on  primary and swap on a logical

[06:08] <Muphrid> we have Tux3 again
[06:08] <Abhijit> kslater, we don't have zfs?
[06:09] <Abhijit> !zfs
[06:09] <ubottu> For information concerning ZFS and Ubuntu, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZFS
[06:09] <kslater> man, a guy goes away for a few months and the whole world changes
[06:09] <Abhijit> :-)
[06:10] <michael_2> kslater: You haven't been using Windows for the past few months have you?
[06:11] <kslater> michael_2: mostly I've been using hospitals and Dr's offices for the past few months. I only use Windows when I have to.
[06:11] <michael_2> klater: ach...That doesn't sound good.
[06:11] <kslater> Type IV GBM (brain cancer)
[06:12] <kslater> I go under the saw / knife again in 5 days.
[06:12] <Kirax> Be strong kslater. People do beat it ^_^
[06:12] <kslater> indeed Kirax and I intend to be one of them.
[06:12] <michael_2> kslater: I'm terribly sorry to hear that.  A lot of my family have gone through cancer.
[06:13] <kslater> this surgery is actually a good thing since it's my best shot at getting a 'clean scan' (MRI with nothing lit up)
=== _JKL1234-_ is now known as The_[206]
[06:13] <cfhowlett> kslater: strong mental attitude.  I recommend the S. L. Jackson philosophy.  "I am sick and tired of this ..."
[06:14] <kslater> I have a great team of Dr's I'm working with. And The Great Physician is also working on me more than a bit.
[06:14] <arrrghhh> dr_willis, uhm... would there be more than just changing the flag to 83 in fdisk and writing it?
[06:14] <kslater> ok, back to the grind
[06:14] <Kirax> Oh on a side note, recently new to ubuntu 12.04 lts. Been using 10.04 for the longest time. I noticed something odd.
[06:15] <kslater> I have a ex-colleague who is a zfs fanatic, but I thought it was only available for *BSD types (and Slowlaris of course)
[06:15] <kslater> I'll have to tell him about this.
[06:15] <Kirax> Boot time / shutdown time and loading programs is very slow. I am on decent hardware. Already checked out cron / init.d and not much is in there.
[06:15] <michael_2> kirax: are you using unity?
[06:16] <michael_2> kslater: I'm pretty sure zfs is a port to linux
[06:16] <michael_2> kslater: meaning it's not native.
=== DrCode_ is now known as DrCode
[06:18] <arrrghhh> so... is there anyway back guys?
[06:18] <kslater> porting code to a new platform isn't a bad thing, it just depends on the efforts
[06:18] <michael_2> arrrghhh: You mean to revert back from LVM?  Not that I can find...And I've been looking.
[06:19] <arrrghhh> I need to undo whatever the Ubuntu installer did to setup LVM on these drives and put them back to plain ext4...
[06:19] <Averna> Hi, I'm trying to update java on ubuntu 10.04. there are 2 listings for canonical in ect/apt/sources. does that seem right?
[06:19] <arrrghhh> michael_2, yea, I don't understand what the installer did... oy.
[06:20] <michael_2> arrrghhh: I suppose you could create a tarball of your system, wipe, repartition, then extract the tarball...
[06:20] <Kirax> arrrghhh my understanding is that once a file type is selected for a drive, only a reformat will change it. (I have limited knowledge on the subject though)
[06:21] <Kirax> Averna, have you tried getting it directly from the java creators site?
[06:21] <arrrghhh> wow... it didn't format to lvm.
[06:21] <Averna> Kirax yes, it seems like I have two copies of java 7. I want the most recent version so I can download minecraft
[06:22] <michael_2> Averna: I have two canonical sources as well
[06:23] <Averna> michael_2 ok that's good. so I guess I can move to the next step. I am using a ghacks directions site
[06:25] <Averna> tried to apt-get update and I get this msg: E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (2: No such file or directory)
[06:25] <Averna> E: Unable to lock the list directory
[06:26] <arrrghhh> michael_2, I don't get what you mean... make a tarball of what?  The data should still be on the drives, I assume... They're just trapped in this LVM thing?  Oy.... what the heck have I done.
[06:26] <cynixx3> Who has a favorite wiki on mounting??
[06:27] <michael_2> arrrghhh: The LVM wont mess up your data.  You still have your same filesystems.  It is just a different partition manager scheme.
[06:27] <topper4125> !mounting | cynixx3
[06:27] <ubottu> cynixx3: For help with partitioning a new install see: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/i386/partitioning.html - For partitioning programs see !GParted, !QtParted (!Kubuntu 8.10 and lower) or !PartitionManager (!Kubuntu 9.04 and up) - Other partitioning topics include !fstab !home and !swap
[06:27] <milamber> cynixx3: man mount
[06:27] <michael_2> Averna: use sudo touch to create that file again.
[06:27] <arrrghhh> michael_2, I don't understand.  How can I mount the data on these drives now?
[06:28] <michael_2> arrrghhh: The same way you mounted them before.  But when using a LVM, the partitions are referenced by names instead of sda3 or whatever.
[06:29] <michael_2> arrrghhh: check out your /etc/fstab file to see if it gives any hints.
[06:29] <arrrghhh> I've on a livecd right now... I just wanted to make sure my data was OK
[06:29] <arrrghhh> before I proceeded to do anything else
[06:29] <cynixx3> milamber, :( i need more than a man. Its a topic that has me upside down and I can never understand why. I need a real tutorial on how the system finds mounting points and how it works
[06:29] <michael_2> arrrghhh: Have you not ran the installer yet?
[06:30] <michael_2> cynixx3: mount points are located in the /etc/fstab file
[06:30] <arrrghhh> michael_2, I had ran it, but stopped it when I freaked out.  Ran a different livecd and wanted to make sure my data was thar
[06:30] <cynixx3> Understand where they are. but sometimes something I plugs in does not show up in that file
[06:30] <michael_2> arrrghhh: The Ubuntu installer can safely transition for a classic partitioning scheme to LVM.
[06:30] <arrrghhh> oh... ok
[06:30] <cynixx3> I just want to read something that tells me why
[06:30] <michael_2> cynixx3: What do you mean?
[06:31] <michael_2> arrrghhh: Just don't select to record your installation OVER that partition
[06:31] <cynixx3> so i have a usb to serial adapte that i use with a rollover cable. Why does it not show up in /etc/fstab?
[06:32] <michael_2> cynixx3: Did you add it to /etc/fstab?
[06:32] <cynixx3> nooo
[06:32] <michael_2> cynixx3: It wont be there if you don't add it.  :P
[06:32] <Averna> Michael_2 thanks. Not familiar with that command. Can you explain? Do I need to go to /var/lib/apt/lists/ to perform sudo touch?
[06:33] <arrrghhh> michael_2, yea, I was really careful where the install was going...
[06:33] <cynixx3> michael_2: do you have a favorite wiki on mounting?
[06:33] <michael_2> Averna: touch is used to create an empty file if it doesn't exist.
[06:33] <topper4125> !fstab
[06:33] <ubottu> The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[06:33] <arrrghhh> Oy.  I had a bit of a heart attack when I saw all the drives change from ext4 to LVM
[06:34] <michael_2> averna: just type sudo touch /path/to/missing/file/error
[06:34] <michael_2> arrrghhh: lol...They're still ext4...Just using a different partition managing schem.  Backwards compatibility might be an issue for you though
[06:35] <michael_2> arrrghhh: That's why I'm currently pissed at my LVM scheme.
[06:35] <ikillcypher> Hello

[06:38] <michael_2> sudo apt-get install system-config-lvm    will give a good one

[06:50] <CrazyZurfer> Hi guys, which is the command to setup some program to be easily executed from terminal, for example instad of "sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start" -> just "sudo lampp start"
[06:51] <limikael> CrazyZurfer: the command needs to be in the path
[06:51] <limikael> so either add the directory containing the command to the path, or make a symlink in /bin
[06:52] <CrazyZurfer> limikael: I guess that I want that.. a symlin, how can I create one? :)
[06:52] <Marzz> When I copy directories (with big files like Videos) in the terminal - e.g. cp -rf /source/source /destination/destination - it does copy it but it doesn't show me anything that it is doing
[06:52] <limikael> ln -s /the/path/to/mycommand /bin/mycommand
[06:52] <Marzz> Is there something, a command or parameter, that I should type so it will show me the current file that it is copying
[06:52] <Marzz> It just stands there without telling me anything and only tells me after a couple of minutes if it was successful or not
[06:54] <limikael> Marzz: i don't know… what i usually do is check the target file with ls -l to see it grow
[06:54] <topper4125> Marzz have you read this: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/cp-command-with-a-progress-bar.html
[06:55] <limikael> topper4125: cool +1
[06:55] <Marzz> limikael: That is what I'm currently doing too
[06:55] <CrazyZurfer> limikael: Thanks!
[06:55] <Marzz> topper4125: No, I just want something like the terminal will output what file it is currently copyiing or something just like when you are updating or downloading kernel updates
[06:56] <CrazyZurfer> I've just installed php5 cli, but don't remember it's package name, how can I remove it?

[06:57] <limikael> CrazyZurfer: that is possible… :) it is possible to ask what package owns a certain file, but i don't remember how

[07:06] <topper4125> warfar, have you tried: sudo apt-get update --fix-broken

[07:07] <warfar> thanks!

[07:11] <warfar> i also have another problem with installing skype, here is the pastebin http://pastebin.com/9xzr5AM5
[07:12] <cfhowlett> BlackDalek: I'm seeing multiple reports but no consistent cause ...
[07:15] <topper4125> warfar are you installing it from a deb file?
[07:15] <soulcito> is possible to configure a openvpn client without encryption?
[07:15] <warfar> topper4125, yeah
[07:16] <topper4125> you can force the install: sudo dpkg -i package.deb then after install use the same sudo command to fix it (source: http://askubuntu.com/questions/222090/cannot-install-skype-due-to-dependency-errors-spkg-doesnt-install-dependencies )
[07:18] <warfar> ok i'll try that
[07:18] <warfar> also when i'm installing wine through terminal, how do i click ok for the tos?
[07:19] <topper4125> usually tab to highlight and 'space' or 'enter' to acknowledge it... its been a LONG time since I agreed to a TOS via terminal
[07:19] <warfar> thanks! tab worked haha
[07:19] <warfar> i just installed ubuntu on my computer today

[07:20] <warfar> i still have to use win7 for some games :P
[07:21] <topper4125> warfar nothing wrong with that... I see no reason to set up a 'puter the way it works fer ya.... I'm not a real die hard 'linux or nothing' kind of person :)
[07:22] <topper4125> Said that wrong: meant I see no reason to complain about how a person sets up their 'puter...
[07:22] <warfar> i'm just hoping i can use linux for most of my computing now
[07:22] <topper4125> there's good gaming in linux (and steam is on its way in... it'll open up a LOT of stuff)
[07:23] <warfar> yeah but the higher end games probobly won't show up
[07:24] <topper4125> we'll have to see, once the big software houses see if steam can make a profit from Linux, they'll come...
[07:24] <warfar> hopefully...

[07:48] <jayar> so i setup ubuntu on a raid array with 2 40gb drives, one seems to be failing, and the raid array is "degraded" how do i fix that?
[07:48] <jayar> it wont let me do anythin
[07:49] <jayar> the one drive is so bad, its serial #/model # is garbled even in BIOS...
[07:50] <Emanon> jayar: What type of raid? Redundant, Striping? Do you have any parity?
[07:52] <jayar> raid 1
[07:52] <topper4125> Syria, almost looks like keyboard cast and ClusterSSH are close to being different solutions to the same problem to me... with the exception of clusterssh being more of a setup for administration only, and keyboard cast being for a bit of everying (10 calculators lol)...

[07:53] <topper4125> Third3ye ... pretty much... they can't guarentee that everyone looking at ubuntu for the first time is knowlegable about 32/64 bit OS's and their limitations/expectations
[07:53] <diki> In particular, airmon-ng,aircrack-ng etc.
[07:54] <Third3ye> Damnit...
[07:54] <Third3ye> Can I just dist-upgrade to 64bit or do I have to reinstall the whole damn thing?
[07:54] <Syria> topper4125:  Thank you I will go with keyboardcast :)
[07:54] <Emanon> jayar: RAID 1 is a mirroring RAID so you have an automatic backup of anything on them the RAID manpage should have options for replacing one of the component drives in case of failure but if you give me a few minutes I'll try to find a how-to so you don't have to try to figure out which combination of flags you should use.
[07:54] <Third3ye> oh and proprietary nvidia drivers... are there compatibility issues with 64bit ubuntu?
[07:55] <tenX> Third3ye: think you cant simply switch from 32 to 64
[07:55] <brady2600> ok in my home folder
[07:55] <topper4125> !persistence | diki
[07:55] <brady2600> there is a folder calledfontconfig
[07:55] <ubottu> diki: To have some persistent storage when using a Live CD, follow the instructions on https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDPersistence
[07:55] <brady2600> im not sure if its a system related folder or
[07:55] <brady2600> if its just some junk folder created in some process
[07:56] <Emanon> Try this jayar: http://www.howtoforge.com/replacing_hard_disks_in_a_raid1_array
[07:56] <topper4125> Third3ye, http://askubuntu.com/questions/5018/is-it-possible-to-upgrade-from-a-32bit-to-a-64bit-installation
[07:57] <Third3ye> lol
[07:57] <brady2600> there is a folder in my home called output
[07:58] <topper4125> Syria, you're welcome, and good luck with keyboardcast
[07:58] <Third3ye> Alright...
[07:58] <brady2600> inside the folder is a series of other folders, gif, exe, docx, all sorts of file types in this folder called output
[07:58] <brady2600> however, none of these folders contain anything
[07:58] <Third3ye> How about this: I use my TV as my main screen via HDMI and because of this I can't hide the dashbar because it won't reappear when I hover the mouse on the left-hand side of the screen, or the top left for that matter...
[07:58] <brady2600> is this folder junk from another process?
[07:58] <Emanon> Now, as a side note did you set up your RAID using the standard drive IDs (/dev/sd*) or via UUID (/dev/disk/by-uuid/<whatever the ID was> ?
[07:59] <Third3ye> Anyone found a solution for this? I was in the configuration file and it's set to <main>yes</main>
[07:59] <brady2600> is this some crazy system for outputting from programs to a million diffrent filetype folders
[07:59] <brady2600> can i safely get rid of this folder?
[08:00] <brady2600> ahhh chat rooms.. that special place we go to ask each other questions as a community so we can all ignore each other.
[08:01] <soulcito> anyone happen to where openvpn profiles (network manager) are in ubuntu 12 are stored?
[08:01] <brady2600> possibly hidden .folder in home
[08:01] <Emanon> Did you consider that it's because we might be helping other people and you are spamming the channel with many short posts instead of one complete one?
[08:02] <XRS1> output is not a folder you would normally find. see if its recovered data you recognise, otherwise throw it out
[08:02] <brady2600> when i ask questions in single lines, they get even less of a response
[08:02] <brady2600> but thanks for trying
[08:02] <XRS1> that was to you brady2600
[08:03] <jayar> Emanon: i set it up standard drive IDs...
[08:03] <chris___> hello can someone tell me how can i uninstall/blacklist vesa? i have already done it but it still reports as loaded.!
[08:03] <XRS1> sudo apt-get purge?
[08:03] <Emanon> Then that link I sent you should be accurate unless they changed something in RAID since the last time I used it jayar.
[08:04] <aeon-ltd> chris___: if it's blacklisted the module shouldn't load when you boot
[08:04] <chris___>   echo "blacklist vesa" > /etc/modprobe.d/vesa.conf   right?
[08:05] <topper4125> <-- done for now... g'nite
[08:05] <jayar> cool thans
[08:05] <jayar> *thanks :)
[08:06] <chris___> how can i remove vesa completely from my system?
[08:07] <H4xt3hpl4n3t> Does Ubuntu 12.10 have atheros Wireless adapter support
[08:07] <Emanon> H4xt3hpl4n3t: Yes.
[08:08] <Emanon> Mine worked by default anyways.
[08:08] <Geet> hi.. I used ubuntu using wubi for over 12 months now.. thought that was the safest way to try it out.. but now that i have done it i would like to dual boot my system with win7.. so is the wubi installation convertable to a dual boot?
[08:09] <H4xt3hpl4n3t> It hasnt recognised mine. But i also have the newer UEFI boot//Legacy mode enabled\\
[08:09] <XRS1> chris___:  you can sudo apt-get remove or sudo apt-get purge the package
[08:09] <XMLnewbi> if I needed to make a folder 777 in chmod             would the command look like  $ chmod u+x filename           Im not sure on the middle part
[08:09] <Emanon> I may just have a supported card too H4xt3hpl4n3t.
[08:10] <jayar> legacy mode just helps with old pci cards (sometimes isa, but i doubt anyone has that anymore)
[08:10] <XMLnewbi> used to making these edits in net2ftp but it giving me erros editing something out of httpdocs
[08:10] <XRS1> Geet:  back up your /home/ directory and once ubuntu is installed, replace it with your backup
[08:11] <XRS1> XMLnewbi: sudo chmod 777 /dir/to/path -Rv
[08:11] <Geet> XRS1 could you please give me a link for a step by step tutorial for this?
[08:12] <XMLnewbi> nice got it thx
[08:12] <mh`> http://askubuntu.com/questions/635/how-to-convert-wubi-install-into-regular-install
[08:12] <mh`> @geet ^
[08:12] <mh`> the script has been maintained, works with latest version
[08:12] <Geet> thanks mh`
[08:12] <mh`> np
[08:14] <XRS1> Geet:  this is a lil more involved than what i was proposing: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1748541
[08:14] <XRS1> nice
[08:15] <XRS1> did not know about that wubi move script

[08:21] <annamaria> ciao
[08:21] <annamaria> !list
[08:21] <DrCode> I have two disk same size, is there way to do dd image from one to ther?
[08:22] <annamaria> yes
[08:22] <DrCode> It seems that I need more space to dd finish, can I use gzip?
[08:22] <annamaria> yes
[08:22] <DrCode> the image come demage
[08:22] <Ben64> DrCode: what are you trying to do exactly
[08:22] <DrCode> gzip compress at same time dd work or it compress after it finish?
[08:22] <DrCode> I have one part ext4
[08:23] <DrCode> it seems that the targer disk is smaller
[08:23] <DrCode> I want to image my hdd1
[08:23] <jayar> annamaria doesnt seem to be one of wit
[08:24] <Ben64> you can't dd to a smaller partition
[08:24] <DrCode> can I use dd to make image to hdd smaller then source?
[08:24] <DrCode> if I will use gzip , it can help?
[08:24] <Ben64> no
[08:24] <DrCode> ok
[08:24] <Emanon> Seriously can we just kickban anyone who says "!list" within a set short period of time after entering the channel? Cause that seems to be what trolls have been doing lately.
[08:24] <DrCode> is there other solution?
[08:24] <mesquka> resize partition before making the image
[08:24] <excalibr> anyone using Wine from its official ppa?
[08:24] <Emanon> Like set up a bot to do it.
[08:25] <DrCode> I don't have space to do it
[08:25] <Ben64> DrCode: you can resize the source partition to be smaller, or you can just copy the data using rsync or something similar
[08:25] <Ben64> !anyone | excalibr
[08:25] <ubottu> excalibr: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[08:25] <DrCode> is there prog that copy only files and then I can mount it?
[08:25] <jayar> DrCode: i used xxclone
[08:26] <DrCode> xxclone , I can then mount it?

[08:29] <jayar> np. its quick n easy. i did it when i got my new SSD, and didnt wanna reinstall. so i used XX to copy my entire install to the new drive (which was also a dif size) and it booted flawlessly. and when i switched drives back, i could mount it and had all my info there
[08:29] <bazhang> keber, english here please
[08:29] <wanfu> poor guy, uses icechat
[08:29] <Ben64> bazhang: its not even ubuntu related
[08:29] <aeon-ltd> !estonian | keber
[08:31] <DrCode> XRS1, redobackup can help me with diffrent size hdd?
[08:31] <XRS1> it will allow you to modify partition sizes
[08:31] <XRS1> easily
[08:31] <jayar> question (mostly because XRS1 just mentioned xfce) anyone remember lightstep? is there a way i can customize my Unity like that?
[08:31] <XRS1> graphically
[08:32] <brady2600> i used to use litestep
[08:32] <jayar> DrCode: yea its a GUI partition proggy, like PartitionMagic i guess (yes no?)
[08:32] <jayar> me too brady
[08:33] <DrCode> ok
[08:33] <DrCode> thankyou
[08:33] <brady2600> there was another one
[08:33] <brady2600> i forgot the name but, it had this really cool side bar
[08:33] <jayar> yea lightstep like fell a few times, then a bunch of people (devoted developers) picked it back up again
[08:33] <brady2600> you could hover your mouse , the sidebar would pop out, if you held it over the notes icon, a notes panel would pop out
[08:33] <jayar> but i havent heard of it in a long time
[08:34] <brady2600> you didn't need to save stuff on it , you could just write stuff down quick, and it would retract when you click on something else
=== ericab is now known as ericab_away
[08:34] <brady2600> i miss that feature sooo much
[08:34] <jayar> yea i even made my own theme a few times, but everytime they updated the damn thing, my theme wouldnt work, and it was a resource hog, back when i had a 266Mhz with 512mb and thought i was KING
[08:34] <brady2600> it had tabs aswell, for multiple pages of notes
[08:35] <brady2600> yes.. thats why i moved to ubuntu, just the ability to theme without windows trying to kill it every new version of the os
[08:35] <jayar> so thats kinda my question... how do I... ME edit my ubuntu theme?
[08:36] <brady2600> ASTON
[08:36] <brady2600> thats what it was called, the other shell
[08:36] <brady2600> good question, i recall window blinds at one point made like a theme builder
[08:37] <brady2600> that would be awsome to have for ubuntu, an application for building your own theme
[08:37] <jayar> im a graphic artist... so i wanna layout my screen that looks like sex with bacon on top
[08:37] <Emanon> Aston Shell was/is awesome.
[08:37] <jayar> wait... yer sayin it doesnt exist yet?
[08:37] <jayar> how f'n open source is this?
[08:37] <brady2600> no.. im just saying it would be awsome
[08:37] <jayar> im mad that it isnt
[08:37] <brady2600> its my understanding that ubuntu is copyleft
[08:38] <jayar> yea but, ubuntu or not, theres tons of other *nix distros...
[08:38] <brady2600> yeah, i like ubuntu with gnome 3.6 though
[08:38] <jayar> wheres the "how to create your own KDE" or GNOME... or whatever
[08:39] <brady2600> one of the other features i liked about aston/litestep was that
[08:39] <brady2600> you could set it up so you could right click on your desktop
[08:39] <brady2600> and you could assign diffrent folders or drives to it
[08:39] <jayar> yea that was my biggest thing
[08:40] <jayar> right click = menu
[08:40] <jayar> and you could make the menu have whatever you wanted
[08:40] <brady2600> so you would see your drive, hover over it in the menue, then a dropdown would open up with its contents, you could quickly drop down , drop down , drop down and find your files quick
[08:40] <jayar> i right click BAM! theres my docs, projects, email...
[08:40] <brady2600> yeah...
[08:40] <jayar> LOVED that

[08:46] <brady2600> a ton of people idle in here, but ive never seen this room moving all that fast, the amount of policing here is excessive, authoritarianism is the way to win people over to your os
[08:46] <decci> I installed virtualbox 4.2 on Ubuntu 10.04.4 and it got installed properly but when I am running it through Ubuntu GUI its not working. how to fix?
[08:47] <jayar> decci: check your error logs /var/logs
[08:47] <mesquka> brady, please stop slamming
[08:47] <bazhang> brady2600, #ubuntu-ops should you wish to discuss further, NOT here
[08:47] <bazhang> decci, got the guest additions installed? the kernel header?
[08:48] <vect0r> Am I able to discuss wine related issues with Ubuntu here? Or only #winehq ?
[08:48] <bazhang> vect0r, app help in that channel
[08:48] <brady2600> yes.. go beg to the people who have already decided to ignore. Thanks comrad.
[08:48] <bazhang> vect0r, did you check the appdb yet
[08:49] <mesquka> finally
[08:49] <decci> bazhang: While I installed Virtualbox, I could see it starting Virtualbox Kernel module
[08:49] <vect0r> Yep, supposed to work fine according to appdb. I have a feeling it's an issue related to my graphics card and ubuntu, not sure though.
[08:49] <kelvinella> there is a bug in inserting text in xfig
[08:49] <kelvinella> missing fonts in xfig in 12.04
[08:49] <decci> bazhang: I dont see anything in logs
[08:50] <mesquka> vect0r: whats the app and problem you are having?
[08:50] <decci> bazhang: the var log shows vboxdrv: TSC mode is synchronized , kernel timer is normal
[08:50] <decci> vboxplci: IOMMU not found
[08:51] <kelvinella> gsfonts-x11 needs to be installed manually to get it to work...
[08:51] <decci> bazhang: How shall I start virtualbox
[08:51] <vect0r> It's a game - Rift - (http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=22884). I've configured as per those options (and tried many different configurations, as well as Wine versions) and the framerate is unplayable. 1FPS at most.
[08:51] <vect0r> Can get it to run and everything like that, but no dice on playability.
[08:51] <bazhang> decci, if the header and guest additions are installed, I'm not sure then; you may wish to also ask in #vbox as well
[08:51] <vect0r> i7 2600 + Radeon 7970 is what I'm running.
[08:51] <degkorat> Hi everybody somebody willing to help?
[08:52] <auronandace> vect0r: are you using unity/compiz?
[08:52] <decci> bazhang: virtualbox wont install if kernel header is missing correct?
[08:52] <mesquka> do you have the drivers installed?
[08:52] <vect0r> I have the latest drivers from AMD installed.
[08:52] <decci> bazhang: How shall I verify it running through commandline
[08:52] <jayar> ask your question, degkorat
[08:52] <degkorat> Thanks
[08:53] <vect0r> auronandace: Using 12.10 out of the box with unity.
[08:53] <degkorat> So I am trying to use Skeychup but I got a problem about pixel, and it does not start
[08:53] <bazhang> degkorat, how long does it hang at ldconfig
[08:53] <degkorat> sorry?
[08:53] <auronandace> vect0r: games in wine don't play nice with compiz, try another desktop like xfce with xfwm
[08:53] <decci> jayar: How shall I start virtualbox through commandline

[08:53] <faryshta> Hi, does usb-creator works for other distros too? I want to install fedora on a usb
[08:54] <degkorat> this is my first, I had another one but solved already
[08:54] <auronandace> vect0r: its the very first warning in the topic in #winehq
[08:54] <bazhang> faryshta, use unetbootin, or ask in #fedora
[08:54] <degkorat> so this is my second
[08:54] <Muphrid> faryshta: no, use unetbootin
[08:54] <mesquka> channel is too fast to follow on my small phone screen
[08:54] <vect0r> Well, if it helps I had the exact same issue using LinuxMint.
[08:54] <faryshta> Muphrid, bazhang thanks
[08:55] <vect0r> It's not that the framerate is just slightly low, it's at 1FPS staring at the ground. I'm thinking it's got to be something else.
[08:55] <vect0r> Just can't figure it out.
[08:55] <jayar> decci: http://www.linux.com/news/enterprise/systems-management/8224-secrets-for-controlling-virtualbox-from-the-command-line

[08:56] <bazhang> degkorat, and where is skeychup installed from, what does it do, is it a windows app through wine or what. please give us these details, First
[08:56] <jayar> bazhang: i think sketchup is a google prog
[08:56] <decci> jayar: I tried running vbox and it says command not found
[08:57] <degkorat> Yes, si it is Sketchup (Google 3d). You can use it for 3d drawing. I installed with wine after download from Google
[08:57] <bazhang> degkorat, and what do google forum s and the wine appdb say about using it with Ubuntu
[08:58] <degkorat> wine just installed. I follow instruction from http://ubuntuguide.net/install-google-sketchup-cad-style-app-in-ubuntu-using-wine
[08:59] <bazhang> degkorat, so you have checked neither?
[08:59] <bazhang> decci, did you read the article jayar linked you to?
[08:59] <decci> bazhang: Yes..I am trying to run vboxManage or vbox but command is not there
[09:00] <bazhang> decci, do you have the case correct?
[09:00] <degkorat> I just get the welcome page of Sketchup, then I get the error that sketchup was unable to inziate the GL... and say to be sure about driver but I don't really know the meaning

[09:09] <joapuipe> hi. I have tracker-miner-fs consuming 100% of one of my cores and 6.6GB of memory. Any advice to reduce the CPU and Mem. usage of this process?
[09:10] <blaz_> can anyone help me... i'm busting my ass on this thing for some weeks now
[09:10] <vect0r> Thank you

[09:11] <nNa> How can I reduce the microphone noise? I know that in Windows, there was just a simple checkbox in the Control Panel, but in Ubuntu I tried alsamixer, etc., but I can't seem to find the option.
[09:12] <faryshta> how can I know my graphic card driver?
[09:12] <blaz_> please
[09:12] <Muphrid> faryshta: do you know the model?
[09:12] <bazhang> faryshta, lspci
[09:12] <malus> blaz_ restate your issue - I can't find your original question...
[09:12] <bazhang> blaz_, is that iptv card compatible with linux?
[09:12] <faryshta> Muphrid, bazhang http://pastebin.com/kVX7m52h
[09:13] <mesquka> lspci | vga
[09:13] <bazhang> blaz_, whats the exact make and model of it
[09:13] <faryshta> mesquka, http://pastebin.com/kVX7m52h
[09:13] <atlef> faryshta, open a terminal and type: inxi -Gx
[09:13] <Muphrid> faryshta: the driver for that is fglrx-legacy, what ubuntu version are you using?
[09:14] <faryshta> Muphrid, 12.10
[09:14] <blaz_> its not an iptv card its an ethernet card i already works so that i can view tv... just that i cant view v and use the internet at the same time....someone once told that the default routes need to be set up
[09:14] <faryshta> atlef, installing inxi
[09:14] <degkorat> Any news about Google Sketchup on Lubuntu?
[09:14] <faryshta> atlef, can't find package inxi
[09:14] <bazhang> degkorat, whats the appdb say? and google forums
[09:14] <blaz_> malus how can i setup iptv over lan to work simultaneusly with internet over wifi? i have 12.04
[09:15] <faryshta> Muphrid, do you think everything will blow or stop working if I uninstall that card?
[09:15] <faryshta> I mean driver. sorry
[09:15] <Muphrid> faryshta: what driver are you using?
[09:15] <degkorat> no answer from appdb
[09:15] <faryshta> Muphrid, I don't know, that is what I am asking
[09:15] <faryshta> Muphrid, which command can tell me?
[09:15] <bazhang> degkorat, its a website
[09:15] <Muphrid> faryshta: fglrx-legacy is not supported by that particular version of ubuntu
[09:15] <blaz_> i tried some things using ifconfig but if i delete the original default route an set he default route throught the wifi card then i dont have tv :D
[09:16] <Muphrid> and i would not advise using 12.10 in radeonhd cards...
[09:16] <Muphrid> there is a ppa for downgrading the xorg
[09:16] <atlef> faryshta, inxi should be there by default
[09:16] <blaz_> a similiar issue with windows is resolved by setting a different mtu
[09:16] <Muphrid> particular version of xorg* i meant
[09:16] <faryshta> inxi program not found :/
[09:16] <degkorat> hold on
[09:16] <faryshta> Muphrid, so what do I do?
[09:17] <Muphrid> faryshta: any reason you want the proprietary drivers?
[09:17] <Muphrid> they are not good for anything except gaming
[09:17] <jayar> blaz_: whats the error?
[09:17] <blaz_> not mtu i mean matrix (the value by which the order of cards is defined)
[09:17] <faryshta> Muphrid, no I don't I don't even know if I have it installed
[09:17] <faryshta> Muphrid, how do I know if I have it installed?
[09:18] <faryshta> Muphrid, is there an alternative?
[09:18] <Muphrid> faryshta: you probably dont
[09:18] <faryshta> Muphrid, so what do I do?
[09:18] <blaz_> jayar there is no error... just that i cant use the net while watching tv on the lan card
[09:18] <Muphrid> faryshta: what exactly do you want to fix, a slow system?
[09:18] <jayar> blaz_: are you using VLC?
[09:18] <faryshta> Muphrid, too much energy consumption and overheating
[09:18] <blaz_> jayar: yes i am
[09:19] <Muphrid> faryshta: follow these instructions http://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/how-to-install-amd-catalyst-legacy.html
[09:19] <64MACH8ZN> hello! i search a documentation of Applet Framework (gnome shell), can anybody help?
[09:19] <mesquka> faryshta: try underclocking
[09:19] <mesquka> dont worry,listen to murphid
[09:20] <faryshta> How do I know which driver I am using? http://pastebin.com/kVX7m52h
[09:20] <faryshta> Muphrid, that is for HD Radeon cards
[09:20] <Muphrid> faryshta: your is Radeon HD3200
[09:20] <auronandace> faryshta: lsmod tells you what is loaded
[09:20] <Muphrid> yours*

[09:20] <michele__> 3d ita
[09:21] <jayar> blaz_: you cant USE the net while watching tv via internet...
[09:21] <faryshta> auronandace, ok what do I look there?

[09:23] <jayar> blaz_: that was a question btw, not to be confused with a statement.
[09:23] <BlackDalek> hey... in the middle of installing xubuntu alongside my regular ubuntu - I am at the paritioning screen.. there is a left side and a right side but utterly no explanantion which side is which :( ... is xubunut the left side or right side?
[09:23] <gaussblurinc> hello! can anybody helps me with Applet Framework (gnome shell)?
[09:23] <iLogical> i don't have kde accessibility package installed but i have it running on my system tray, how do i remove it
[09:23] <iLogical> ?
[09:23] <blaz_> jayar: aha ok :D yes while watching IPTV i CAN'T use the internet
[09:23] <faryshta> Muphrid, but that will install another driver, I want to know which one I am using first
[09:23] <Muphrid> iLogical: do you know the package name?
[09:24] <Muphrid> faryshta: there are only two radeon drivers, the one included in xorg (xserver-xorg-video-radeon) and fglrx
[09:24] <jayar> blaz_: thats very odd. when you pause, can you use the internet? or is it just while its open
[09:24] <BlackDalek> is there a separate channel for xubuntu questions or is this the right channel?
[09:24] <iLogical> kdeaccessibility
[09:24] <blaz_> jayar: its while i have the lan cable inserted
[09:24] <iLogical> it's not installed though
[09:24] <atlef> !xubuntu

[09:25] <jayar> ...
[09:25] <Muphrid> faryshta: type 'lsmod | grep radeon'
[09:25] <Muphrid> is the radeon module is loaded then youre using the xorg driver
[09:25] <jayar> blaz_: please tell me that you have the lan cable inserted the entire time you are trying to gain internet access...
[09:25] <blaz_> jayar: because the default route goes through over the lan cable... which is hooked in a viedo out port on the modem, and has no internet acces, just iptv acces
[09:25] <Muphrid> if*
[09:26] <faryshta> Muphrid, http://pastebin.com/6WbRxF4Q
[09:26] <Muphrid> faryshta: lspci -v | grep -A 10 VGA\ compatible    could work aswell
[09:26] <jayar> blaz_: oh wait... you're trying to use an iptv connection to access the internet?
[09:26] <blaz_> jayar: i do not have internet over the lan cable.... its just for iptv... i connect via the wifi for the internet
[09:27] <BlackDalek> no one is awake in #xubuntu
[09:27] <iLogical> Muphrid, do you know how to disable it?
[09:27] <blaz_> jayar: no i use wifi for internet and lan for iptv
[09:27] <Muphrid> faryshta: yes youre using the radeon driver from xorg
[09:27] <jayar> well theres yer problem kid
[09:27] <iLogical> found it nvm
[09:27] <blaz_> jayar: but cannot use both at the same time
[09:27] <Muphrid> iLogical: i dont use kde, you should look for the package name. type ps -u yourusername
[09:27] <Muphrid> and look for the process
[09:27] <BlackDalek> hey... in the middle of installing xubuntu alongside my regular ubuntu - I am at the paritioning screen.. there is a left side and a right side but utterly no explanantion which side is which :( ... is xubunut the left side or right side?
[09:27] <iLogical> Muphrid, already found it, nvm, thanks
[09:28] <faryshta> Muphrid, http://pastebin.com/3ScZaG1Z
[09:28] <Muphrid> faryshta: yes, like i said...
[09:28] <faryshta> Muphrid, what if I uninstall that driver and NOT use fglrx?
[09:28] <Muphrid> going on
[09:29] <Muphrid> faryshta: you will have a low graphics fallback
[09:29] <Cur10u8> which torrent client is the best for ubuntu?
[09:29] <Muphrid> resolution and other things wont be detected
[09:29] <jayar> ohhhhhhhhhhhh i gotchya... so your wireless card is on yer wifi, but when you plug in to watch tv, it takes over your net... i cant say its an IP conflict, cuz im not sure how the iptv box gives you an ip (dhcp or static) but it sounds more like one of your lan/wifi cards is taking over
[09:29] <blaz_> Cur10u8: try transmission
[09:29] <jayar> i have 3 on my box, and i cant use 2 at a time...
[09:30] <faryshta> but to install fglrx I need to downgrade xorg right?
[09:30] <Muphrid> faryshta: unfortunately, yes
[09:30] <faryshta> Muphrid, I dunno if that is what I want. I prefer to roll back to 11.10
[09:30] <jayar> blaz_: have you tried to bridge the connections?
[09:31] <Muphrid> faryshta: I have a similar card, HD3300 and im running 12.04.1 , got no issues with graphics or performance
[09:31] <Muphrid> running the radeon module
[09:31] <degkorat> hi again, it says many things but not why does not work
[09:31] <Cur10u8> what can i use as alternate to notepad++ for windows. as it does not support ubuntu.
[09:31] <jayar> blaz_: (that worked for my partners pc which has a nas/lan and my network)
[09:31] <blaz_> jayar: yes its is like that :D i do remeber on win xp it was solved by setting a different matrix for each card then it would work.... on win7 it works automatically.... on raspberry pi i set it up using vlan
[09:32] <aeon-ltd> Cur10u8: what features do you need?
[09:32] <Muphrid> faryshta: the xorg downgrading operation is reversible
[09:32] <Muphrid> you can try it...
[09:32] <jayar> you lost me at matrix
[09:32] <vect0r> auronandace: Thanks for the tip, installed xubuntu and selected that as my session after reboot, however, still not going over 1FPS. The search continues.
[09:32] <Cur10u8> html and css editor.
[09:32] <blaz_> jayar: i will look insto brigding connections... one moment
[09:33] <jayar> put the interfaces on dif subnets maybe
[09:33] <blaz_> jayar: the lan is on static ip
[09:34] <aeon-ltd> Cur10u8: http://superuser.com/questions/256035/what-is-a-good-linux-html-css-php-editor-for-somebody-recently-migrated-from-n
[09:34] <degkorat> No help here?
[09:35] <blaz_> jayar: yes sorry its not the matrix its a value to assign to the card so the pc knows which has the priority
[09:35] <jayar> yea but you have 2 dif connections to the world. wifi and iptv. they both need to be in love with 127.0.0.1. they dont like to share tho... unless you running windows and enable "network sharing"
[09:36] <degkorat> Is there anybody around Bangkok that I can meet to let the program works?
[09:37] <blaz_> jayar: the value is called interface metric :D
[09:37] <faryshta> Muphrid, I see I have other xserver-xorg-video-* drivers installed
[09:37] <faryshta> Muphrid, including intel, nvidia, etc. should I remove them?
[09:38] <jayar> yea i knew what you meant :)
[09:38] <Muphrid> faryshta: they are pre-installed because people have different hardware and they should support the most hardware possible
[09:38] <Muphrid> they are inoffensive to your hardware
[09:38] <degkorat> Somebody here for help?
[09:38] <faryshta> Muphrid, so they are not causing overheating too? if I remove them something bad happens?
[09:39] <Muphrid> faryshta: no
[09:39] <Muphrid> they are not even loaded

[09:40] <jayar> blaz_ matrix is funnier. : however.. when you $ ifconfig, it shows 2 network devices, 2 IPs, they're both static, fine, but are the subnets the same? are the IPs the same?

[09:42] <degkorat> Really not nice no have help. I am trying from many weeks to let the Ubuntu working and seems it does not and everybody looks like are an elite of programmer that never give a clear answer.
[09:42] <degkorat> I think I will remove all
[09:42] <jayar> degkorat: what is your issue?
[09:42] <blaz_> jayar: yes it shows them both wifi is not static.. i found something on the net now... will try it but will probably lose net connection will come back if it works
[09:43] <degkorat> I would like to use Sketchup. It does not work as it doesn not work Open office and more and I don't know why
[09:43] <degkorat> I spend hours on forums and terminal for nothing

[09:44] <degkorat> also the synaptic never have something when I look for
[09:44] <BHAGI> any backtrack buddies ????
[09:44] <degkorat> or maybe I don't know how to use it

[09:47] <mystery> my*
[09:47] <jayar> faryshta: it will boot fine until you get to the OS, then it will either tell you its broken, or not show you the beautiful images you desire
[09:47] <IdleOne> mystery: contact your local police, has nothing to do with Ubuntu
[09:47] <mystery> But look at that link.
[09:47] <jayar> lol
[09:48] <mystery> You've talked to him.
[09:48] <faryshta> jayar, well that is a problem
[09:49] <IdleOne> mystery: I have talked to literally thousands of people in the last 6-7 years
[09:49] <mystery> OK.
[09:50] <jayar> faryshta: when you uninstall a graphic card driver, when you reboot, it wants to reinstall it
[09:51] <faryshta> jayar, but if the system doesn't load I won't be able to connect to internet and re install the driver.
[09:51] <jayar> well if the system doesnt load, its not your video card thats the problem
[09:52] <faryshta> jayar, just to make it sure. how do I download installation files without installing them with apt-get ?
[09:52] <degkorat> still there? Suggestion?
[09:53] <Muphrid> faryshta: --download-only ?

[09:58] <degkorat> how?
[09:58] <Ben64> type "regedit"
[09:58] <atlef> wine will open regedit.exe
[09:58] <degkorat> or there is another way ti use Sketchup?
[09:58] <jayar> goto start>cmd and type regedit.exe
[09:58] <degkorat> how?
[09:58] <jayar> what version of windows are you running on wine?
[09:58] <jayar> or is that a stupid question

[10:01] <Muphrid> faryshta: Good luck
[10:03] <LeMike> hello. can someone help with symlinks please? I do "ln -s ./vendor/buddy ./htdocs/wp-content/themes" on a folder but the created link is useless and just looks like a file.
[10:04] <faryshta> Muphrid, jayar rebooted. everything looks the same. after removing xserver-xorg-video-radeon
[10:05] <Muphrid> faryshta: check what module is used in lspci -v
[10:05] <jayar> ^
[10:06] <degkorat> OK, now I can open it but I cannot save the image
[10:06] <faryshta> http://pastebin.com/n8dHtSau Muphrid jayar
[10:07] <degkorat> and how to install open office from Synaptic?
[10:07] <degkorat> later I will see why cannot save images, Temporary I will screen shot it
[10:07] <Muphrid> faryshta: Um, youre still using the same
[10:07] <faryshta> mup
[10:08] <Third3ye> Ey -- after installing ubuntu 64 and doing a dist-upgrade with stable nvidia drivers unity won't start
[10:08] <faryshta> Muphrid, damn. I uninstalled the package
[10:08] <GoogleGuy> I have an issue where rsyslog is not logging anything. What's the best way to debug that?
[10:08] <Third3ye> There's no window manager at all and when I log in there's nothing on the desktop except the wallpaper
[10:08] <faryshta> Muphrid, how can I remove the driver?
[10:08] <Third3ye> How do I debug this problem, where are the crash logs for unity?
[10:09] <faryshta> apt-get remove xserver-xorg-video-radeon didn't worked
[10:09] <Muphrid> faryshta: you can simply blacklist it though i dont know what you would use instead
[10:09] <goddard> how can i mount this disk? http://pastebin.com/P4409Vi6
[10:10] <faryshta> Muphrid, I think I won't use graphic card at all. I don't play video games and don't even have flash installed

[10:14] <MonkeyDust> !ask
[10:14] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[10:15] <Muphrid> faryshta: Um, i think youre better downgrading still
[10:15] <jacklk> Are there any support channels for Openbox?
[10:16] <Muphrid> faryshta: what if you use something like gnome fallback instead of unity?
[10:17] <faryshta> Muphrid, I am using xfce
[10:18] <Muphrid> faryshta: that should be a performance problem
[10:18] <Muphrid> shouldnt*
[10:21] <Emanon> So, I heard that 13.04 may integrate network bonding into the network manager, is this true?
[10:21] <Emanon> Or is there a better channel to ask this in?
[10:22] <ChaozHenchman> I think #ubuntu-offtopic would be better suited for this
[10:22] <ChaozHenchman> because it's not really a troubleshooting thing
[10:23] <Emanon> But this is on topic just a beta release is there a channel for upcoming ubuntu releases?
[10:23] <Muphrid> Emanon: #ubuntu-devel i think
[10:23] <Emanon> Thank you Muphrid.
[10:23] <ChaozHenchman> did not know about that channel
[10:23] <Emanon> It's ok it happens to me all the time. :-)
[10:24] <MonkeyDust> Emanon  support for 13.04 in #ubuntu+1
[10:24] <Emanon> Thanks again.
[10:25] <bazhang> Emanon, its #ubuntu+1
[10:25] <Emanon> Thanks bazhang I'm in there now.
[10:28] <Third3ye> What's ubuntus gdm?
[10:28] <Third3ye> I'm trying to restart it because I think the nvidia drivers were to blame for my problems -- so I've now removed them and want to restart the login screen :P
[10:28] <Emanon> LightDM handles the login screen I think.
[10:29] <Third3ye> There we go..!
[10:29] <Third3ye> So now the question is: how the hell do I get nvidia to work?
[10:29] <jayar> ^ what Emanon said, and you can use CTRL+ALT+F1 to get to prompt
[10:29] <Third3ye> jayar: way ahead of you ^^
[10:30] <Third3ye> I'm not a complete n00b :P
[10:30]  * jayar was late on the answer tip
[10:30] <Third3ye> Had to use apt-get to remove the nvidia drivers
[10:30] <Emanon> I hope I'm not either but I didn't know about ctrl alt f1
[10:30] <Third3ye> But I still want the proprietary nvidia drivers :/ I only installed ubuntu to use steam
[10:30] <Third3ye> Emanon: it's how you get to the console :)
[10:30] <Emanon> And I didn't know that.
[10:31] <jayar> wait what? "only installed ubuntu to use steam" ???
[10:31] <Third3ye> I wanted to test steam for linux
[10:31] <jayar> ah!
[10:31] <Emanon> I'm used to alt+d2 for the quick version and ctrl+alt+t for the ful terminal.
[10:31] <Emanon> alt+f2 I meant.
[10:31] <Third3ye> So I installed the 32bit, it worked -- then I installed 64bit, and it didn't work with the nvidia drivers :/
[10:32] <Emanon> It works fine with mine...
[10:32] <Emanon> Or at least it works.
[10:32] <jayar> that would be a hardware issue
[10:32] <Emanon> I have multiple monitors so nothing really "works great"

[11:04] <ubottu> lonnie start here: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo

[11:06] <ActionParsnip> Warfar: I suggest you unmount the NTFS, boot to Windows and run a scandisk
[11:07] <wdp> lonnie, i don't think it's meant like that; i.e. i don't think they really have root access. by default ubuntu has no root password set. However, they _might_ have or lemme rephrase "one" might use sudo or a special user account with root permissions. You should check your sudo rules. Anyway: Read the "we have root" part with the following sentence in that article.
[11:07] <ActionParsnip> Lonnie: the Amazon suggestion thing is anonymous.  You can remove the Amazon thing easily
[11:07] <warfar> alright
[11:08] <wdp> lonnie, i think it's meant like that: you're installing ubuntu - that means you're trusting them in some way - there might be all sorts of exploits, and code in applications which originate from ubuntu developers.
[11:08] <wdp> not saying that is the case, just saying that is possible. so in a way... they have root.
[11:09] <jayar> wdp: you can say that for any distro of opensource OS
[11:09] <lonnie> I was concerned that he means, he can see all your files if he wants too, but choses not to and you should continue to trust him. He said "we have root"
[11:09] <wdp> jayar, correct.
[11:09] <ActionParsnip> Yay I'm the top dog in launchpad karma.
[11:09] <aeon-ltd> derailing but; if you are afraid can you truly trust anyone. can you trust microsoft just because you pay for a license?
[11:09] <lonnie> If there is not root, then why would he say "we have root"  ?
[11:09] <wdp> lonnie, this is correct -> he could, if he adds that to some application.
[11:09] <Ben64> lonnie: a quick google search answers your question

[11:10]  * wdp wonders if such questions are really not part of support-questions. Actually there's a user who needs support because he/she is wondering about an official statement on some page regarding the security of ubuntu.

[11:27] <Third3ye> I installed Linux specifically to try out steam for linux...
[11:27] <ActionParsnip> El-e-va-tion: is there anything output in konsole?
[11:27] <Third3ye> I want a 64bit OS, I want the nvidia drivers... nao! :P
[11:28] <Third3ye> I'll try to reinstall using the official package... maybe even using an older kernel
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: tried the xorg updates PPA (not the edgers)
[11:28] <Third3ye> the ubuntu package I mean
[11:28] <El-E-Va-Tion> ActionParsnip:  Yep, it says "sni-qt/2773" WARN  void StaticNoitfierItemFactory::connectToSnw()
[11:28] <El-E-Va-Tion> Invalid interface to SNW_SERVICE
[11:28] <Third3ye> Don't think I have edge turned on...
[11:29] <jayar> troop: you can change the font of gedit if thats what your asking
[11:29] <ActionParsnip> El-e-va-tion: ok, find out what that means online
[11:29] <Igramul> Hi, how can I disable the voice output (might be in the login menu)?
[11:29] <Igramul> I am not aware that I'd enabled it.
[11:30] <Igramul> but its "welcome to ..." almost made me deaf
[11:30] <El-E-Va-Tion> ActionParsnip:  only result is something in Italian for VLC, I don't think it's related
[11:31] <ikillcypher> Hi guys
[11:31] <Ben64> Third3ye: you should use the 310 beta in the ubuntu repos
[11:31] <Wintus> Hi, is there anyone who could help me with my Thinkpads trackpoint problem?
[11:31] <Ben64> Third3ye: works great with steam
[11:31] <ikillcypher> Im issues with my Ubuntu
[11:31] <ikillcypher> :(
[11:31] <ikillcypher> im actually a newbie
[11:31] <Third3ye> Ben64: is it the one marked "unstable"?
[11:31] <MonkeyDust> ikillcypher  let's hear it
[11:31] <Ben64> Third3ye: possibly
[11:31] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates; sudo apt-get update;  sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[11:32] <ikillcypher> I cant install my ati card here
[11:32] <Ben64> Third3ye, ActionParsnip: that version isn't as good
[11:32] <Igramul> I installed mythbuntu-desktop, btw.
[11:32] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: which ati chip and which release
[11:33] <Third3ye> Alright... we'll try both :P first; the "experimental" version...
[11:33] <Ben64> Third3ye: i'm just saying, because i play games on steam daily
[11:33] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: 304 works well here
[11:33] <Ben64> steam even tells you to install 310
[11:33] <ikillcypher> ATI 3400
[11:33] <ikillcypher> no idea about release
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: yeah it also advises the bleeding edge xorg, pretty weird if you ask me
[11:34] <Third3ye> hmm... I did some grub configuring to... added "nomodes"
[11:34] <jayar> ikillcypher: have you checked the "additional drivers"
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: what is the output of: lsb_release -sc
[11:34] <Third3ye> Would that be detrimental or should I just leave it?
[11:34] <Ben64> nvidia has been putting through a bunch of updates for linux because of steam
[11:34] <ikillcypher> and 2) issue
[11:34] <Third3ye> Which is awesome ^_~
[11:34] <ikillcypher> ikillcypher@ikillcypher:~$ su
[11:34] <ikillcypher> Password:
[11:34] <Ben64> 304 -> 310 almost doubled my framerate in TF2
[11:35] <ikillcypher> su: Authentication failure
[11:35] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: use    sudo -I
[11:35] <Third3ye> ikillcypher: don't use su... use sudo
[11:35] <Igramul> ikillcypher: use sudo
[11:35] <ikillcypher> guys
[11:35] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: there is no root pass and the account is disabled
[11:35] <ikillcypher> quantal
[11:35] <Third3ye> or sudo bash if you don't want to reenter the password everytime you're entering a command
[11:35] <Igramul> ikillcypher: usually, Ubutnu has no root password set
[11:35] <ikillcypher> <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: what is the output of: lsb_release -sc  >>> quantal
[11:35] <jayar> yea youre not a super user... your making the super user DO stuff for you
[11:35] <El-E-Va-Tion> can anybody help me with kppp window disappearing in 12.10?
[11:36] <ikillcypher> why am I not a superuser ?
[11:36] <Ben64> security
[11:36] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: the xorg version in Quantal hates 2xxx 3xxx snd 4xxx ati gpus. There is a fix
[11:36] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: you get admin access via sudo, logging into gui session as root is mot wise
[11:37]  * ikillcypher is new so he does not understand this
[11:37] <ikillcypher> ok so how do I fix up my first issue
[11:37] <ikillcypher> getting ati working on Ubuntu
[11:37] <Third3ye> Ha! it worked, Ben64 ^^
[11:37] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: http://mobile.dudamobile.com/site/ashwinraon_1?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ashwinraon.com%2F2012%2F10%2Famd-legacy-driver-solution-for-ubuntu-12-10%2F&dm_redirected=true
[11:37] <Ben64> Third3ye: :)
[11:38] <ewan_> hi
[11:39] <Wintus> I have a problem with my new Thinkpad L430. It has both touchpad and trackpoint. When I installed 12.10 it only finds the touchpad. I installed the tp-trackpoint-elantech package and the trackpoint started working. But now I want the touchpad disabled and I can't seem to do it without disabling the trackpoint. Xinput recognizes only one pointer at a time, though there is supposed to be two of them. :l
[11:39] <ikillcypher> Error: need a repository as argument
[11:39] <ikillcypher> o.O
[11:40] <DrCode> ok, dd worked, it was target disk size, thankyou
[11:40] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx
[11:41] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: each command starts with the word sudo, so you can now break it up as it should be, the author missed the semicolon between
[11:42] <ikillcypher> not working
[11:42] <Third3ye> Now we can only hope they port the gamebryo, unreal and crysis engines :D
[11:43] <ActionParsnip> Ikillcypher: how can I possibly reply to thst?
[11:43] <ewan_> i'm about to file a bug against nexus 7 installer functionality running on 12.04. Before I do, is anyone here involved in that area, or can offer guidance on making that report as useful as possible?
[11:43] <ikillcypher> hold on let me get a hold of it
[11:43] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: unreal is ported. What do you think runs urban terror ;)
[11:43] <Third3ye> Ah shiiit :P ofc
[11:43] <Third3ye> Gamebryo then
[11:44] <Third3ye> Then we could play Fallout and Skyrim on Linux ^_~
[11:44] <Third3ye> without emulation, I mean
[11:44] <Third3ye> Now! on to the next task...!
[11:44] <Third3ye> How do I get HDMI sound to work?
[11:44] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: which emulator runs syrim?
[11:44] <MonkeyDust> Third3ye  don't hit the enter key too often, it's getting a headache
[11:45] <Third3ye> Sorry, MonkeyDust :P ActionParsnip: I'd asume a derivative of wine... like cedegas new venture, whatever it's called again...
[11:45] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: go look up what Wine is an acronym for ;-)
[11:46] <faryshta> Muphrid, after install I have to reboot right?
[11:46] <Muphrid> faryshta: yes
[11:46] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: not an emulator
[11:46] <vect0r> Quick question, I've got a Radeon 7970. I've installed the latest beta drives - running Ubuntu 11.10. Going into All Settings -> Details -> Graphics, it is showing Driver - VESA: TAHITI
[11:46] <Third3ye> lol - ofc, but nvm semantics :P
[11:46] <vect0r> shouldn't it be showing something else?
[11:47] <cub> hello
[11:47] <faryshta> Muphrid, rebooting, wish me luck
[11:47] <Muphrid> GL
[11:47] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: calling something what it isn't is not semantics,  its being incorrect :-)
[11:49] <Third3ye> Alright, alright :P So HDMI sound doesn't seem to work... it shows up HDA Intel but not Nvidia... I'm guessing it is Intel HDA that's the media interface, but when testing audio via the sound configuration there is no sound whatsoever...
[11:49] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: if you run the sound app in dash, do you see the hdmi as an option for output?
[11:50] <Third3ye> Yes -- it's what I tried to test sound with (the whole left-right thing) but it didn't make a sound
[11:51] <jacklk> Has the additonal drivers feature from Ubuntu been removed?
[11:51] <jacklk> I need to install my crappy AMD Radeon drivers.
[11:51] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: if you run alsamixer   are all levels unmuted and maxed. If you press F6, is the hdmi selected?
[11:52] <jrib> jacklk: no it was moved to a tap in software sources
[11:52] <jrib> s/tap/tab
[11:52] <jacklk> jrib: SO what can I do?
[11:52] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: which ati and which release?
[11:52] <jacklk> I have an ATI Radeon HD6290
[11:52] <jrib> jacklk: use it?
[11:52] <jacklk> that's all the know
[11:52] <Third3ye> Yepp, everything is unmuted ActionParsnip
[11:52] <jacklk> jrib: What's a "tap in sources"?
[11:52] <jrib> jacklk: "tab" not "tap"
[11:53] <jacklk> Sources?
[11:53] <jrib> jacklk: software sources
[11:53] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: what is the output of: lsb_release -sc
[11:53] <jacklk> WHere do I find them?
[11:53] <jrib> jacklk: system settings or from the menu in software center
[11:53] <jacklk> quantal ActionParsnip
[11:53] <jacklk> ok jrib
[11:55] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: sudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-amdcccle; sudo aticonfig --initial
[11:55] <faryshta> Muphrid, just came back to say thanks, looks like the computer is not heating now
[11:56] <Muphrid> faryshta: alright, glad it is working
[11:56] <jacklk> ActionParsnip OKay
[11:59] <Third3ye> here's my alsainfo.sh output -> http://goo.gl/tvzrl
[11:59] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: copied from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[11:59] <mar> I have a problem in my laptob hp proBook in ubuntu 10.04 the sound come from both speaker and headphones
[12:01] <ActionParsnip> Mar: lucid has about 4 months support,  is it really worth it? Why not install Precise and get support til April 2017
[12:01] <cfhowlett> ActionParsnip: your logic is unassailable, Captain ...
[12:02] <ActionParsnip> Cfhowltt: aye ya scurvvy seadawg
[12:03] <gartral> hello all, I'm looking for a way to set up automatic cd ripping from a headless machine, just open tray, drop in disk, close tray and a few minutes later it's done.. any way to do this? Please kep in mind that this is a headless server and doesn't have a graphical front-end
[12:04] <ActionParsnip> Gartral: you could have a script to run after cd is inserted, you can ssh in to run it
[12:05] <mar> what you mean there is no answer now :'(
[12:05] <gartral> ActionParsnip: I have that.. but what I want to do is automate it.. it's more for my father who.. well.. is used to a Wii..
[12:06] <ActionParsnip> Mar: by the time you setup the OS, it will cease to be supported.
[12:06] <Tashtego> hi. i am trying to install latest catalyst drivers under ubuntu. and i get an error "previous install of the fglrx driver has been detected".... ? but dpkg -l | grep fglrx <- no hits
[12:06] <ActionParsnip> Mar: why such an ancient release?
[12:07] <ActionParsnip> Gartral: http://www.andrews-corner.org/abcde.html
[12:07] <gartral> Tashtego: try building the package through the CCC install
[12:07] <ActionParsnip> Mar: why did you not install the latest LTS?
[12:07] <Tashtego> ? how .. what is ccc install
[12:08] <poq> Hi guys. Can anybode tell me is the Ultimate Boot CD legal and free for use?
[12:08] <gartral> Tashtego: that's the Catalyst Control Center installer .run you got from AMD.
[12:08] <mar> how you mean reinstall ubuntu again ???
[12:08] <MonkeyDust> poq  you mean Ultimate Edition?
[12:08] <Tashtego> gartral: how can i build the package?
[12:09] <gartral> ActionParsnip: Perfect! I had forgotten about abcde
[12:09] <gartral> Tashtego: run the .run by double clicking it, it'
[12:09] <cfhowlett> poq: don't know as it's not supported on this channel.  suggest you contact them direct ...
[12:09] <gartral> Tashtego: run the .run by double clicking it, it's an option in the early step
[12:10] <poq> MonkeyDust: I can't see any editions. Here is http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/ what I am talking about
[12:10] <MonkeyDust> poq  download it and try it
[12:11] <Tashtego> gartral: there were errrors during package generation :(
[12:11] <jacklk> Hi, when launching a game I get this error: http://pastebin.com/5QzAsE5M
[12:11] <jacklk> Can anyone help?
[12:11] <Tashtego> gartral: ./packages/Ubuntu/ati-packager.sh: 294: ./packages/Ubuntu/ati-packager.sh: debclean: not found
[12:11] <Tashtego> ./packages/Ubuntu/ati-packager.sh: 295: ./packages/Ubuntu/ati-packager.sh: dpkg-buildpackage: not found
[12:12] <ActionParsnip> Mar: yes, or upgrade directly to Precise.
[12:12] <gartral> Tashtego: ahh.. apt-get install build-essential
[12:12] <atlef> jacklk, do you have your gfx card driver installed
[12:12] <jacklk> atlef: idk
[12:12] <ActionParsnip> Mar: again,  why such an ancient release with so little support left in it?
[12:12] <jacklk> I done what ActionParsnip said, I don't think I have the real drvier
[12:12] <jacklk> *driver
[12:13] <Third3ye> So now there's no sound whatsoever... not from internal speakers, not from hdmi either...
[12:13] <wargar2> hey is it logical to set my swapspace to my win7 install?
[12:13] <k1l_> wargar2: what?
[12:13] <wargar2> im installing Ubuntu and i should set a swap  space
[12:13] <mar> what did you mean i didn't get what you said
[12:14] <ActionParsnip> Wargar2: you could use a swap file stored in NTFS (maybe, never done it). Swap is usually its own partition
[12:14] <wargar2> would it effect windows
[12:14] <ActionParsnip> Mar: why did you install lucid (ubuntu 10.04) when it has only 4 months support left?
[12:14] <Third3ye> So how do I failcheck alsa sound or kernel audio drivers anyways?
[12:15] <atlef> !sound | Third3ye
[12:15] <ubottu> Third3ye: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.
[12:15] <k1l_> wargar2: make a seperate partition for swap. that is the easiest
[12:15] <Tashtego> gartral: make: dh: Command not found
[12:15] <Tashtego> make: *** [build-arch] Error 127
[12:15] <Tashtego> dpkg-buildpackage: error: debian/rules build gave error exit status 2
[12:15] <Tashtego> [Error] Generate Package - error generating package : Ubuntu/precise
[12:15] <mar> Oops may be this the problem of our support team they already gave my this Laptob with this version !!!
[12:16] <ActionParsnip> Wargar2: no, but i'd recommend using its own partition.  If you tell the installer to use the NTFS as swao, it will wipe it and use the whole partition
[12:16] <ActionParsnip> Mar: no, lucid is nearly dead
[12:16] <troop> can i tune fontconfig on live cd ?
[12:16] <wargar2> how do ii add a partion in setup
[12:16] <ActionParsnip> Troop: sure, you can do anything in liveCD except reboot
[12:16] <gartral> Tashtego: I'm not being mean, and to prove the point I'll give you one last hint, but from here out you should do your own research if things blow up.. apt-get install debhelper
[12:17] <troop> ActionParsnip thanks
[12:17] <jacklk> http://pastebin.com/5QzAsE5M
[12:17] <jacklk> Please help
[12:17] <ActionParsnip> Mar: you can upgrade to Precise from Lucid, both are LTS so it is supported
[12:18] <MonkeyDust> !info teeworlds

[12:18] <wargar2> how do i add a partion on Ubuntu setup
[12:18] <mar> ActionParsnip: many thanks but how can i do that :)
[12:18] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: is there a config file storing the resolution to use?
[12:19] <jacklk> I think so
[12:19] <jacklk> I will have a search
[12:19] <ActionParsnip> !upgrade | mar
[12:19] <ubottu> mar: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[12:19] <atlef> wargar2, you need to shrink windows partition and create free space for ubuntu to be installed
[12:19] <gartral> Tashtego: It's not you... I just hold a very deep grudge against AMD..
[12:19] <atlef> !install | wargar2
[12:19] <wargar2> aww dang i have to go into win again
[12:19] <ubottu> wargar2: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall - Don't want to use a CD? See http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
[12:20] <jacklk> ActionParsnip: I've found it
[12:20] <jacklk> What shall I set the resolution to?
[12:20] <wargar2> how much is reccomended?
[12:20] <jacklk> This monitor is like 1440 x 900
[12:20] <mar> may thanks ActionParsnip and ubottu
[12:20] <wargar2> (swap size)
[12:20] <Tashtego> gartral: ... installed deb-helper. even now it crashes. well its quite the latest ubuntu version and it doesnt support my vga card.... thats ... what about "long time support" ;(
[12:20] <wargar2> i have 8gb ram
[12:21] <atlef> same as ram
[12:21] <Tashtego> gartral:  thx anyways
[12:21] <gartral> Tashtego: wait
[12:21] <gartral> Tashtego: what card?
[12:21] <Tashtego> gartral: Radeon HD 7850 Royal King
[12:21] <jacklk> ActionParsnip: I've changed it, now I get this: http://pastebin.com/eSquXvuH
[12:22] <wargar2> nice card
[12:22] <gartral> Tashtego: *sigh* hang on..
[12:22] <Tashtego> gartral: <3 !
[12:22] <wargar2> lol
[12:24] <gartral> Tashtego: 35 seconds of googling reveals this.. http://askubuntu.com/questions/205112/ubuntu-12-10-amd-intel-hybrid-graphics-not-working/210565#210565 follow it up to the Optional part..
[12:24] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: tried renaming the config folder for the game?
[12:25] <jacklk> ActionParsnip: What to?
[12:25] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: something different
[12:25] <jacklk> Why?
[12:26] <gartral> Tashtego: in the future, invest in Nvidia.
[12:26] <jacklk> that would just mess it up even more if it can't find the files?
[12:26] <troop> hello again. now im on live cd. where is fontconfig file?
[12:27] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: the app will see no config and make a vanilla folder for you. What do you think happened when you first installed and ran it?
=== Morphje__ is now known as Morphje
[12:27] <jacklk> oka
[12:28] <jacklk> Shall I delete the current folder?
[12:28] <jacklk> Or move it somewhereit cannot find?
[12:28] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: no, rename, like I said and explained
[12:28] <jacklk> uhm
[12:28] <jacklk> ok
[12:29] <jacklk> Well
[12:29] <jacklk> it still fails
[12:29] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: jesus, if its too hard just add the wird 'old' to the end
[12:29] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: did a new folder get generated?
[12:29] <jacklk> It's not hard I never said it was
[12:29] <jacklk> Yes
[12:29] <jacklk> another folder did get generated
[12:30] <jacklk> It looks like a problem with my graphics driver, after I installed it I keep getting these error messages
[12:30] <jacklk> Maybe I should just sudo rm -r /?
[12:30] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: thats how configs work. Very handy. Now you know its not the config at fault. You can delete the new config and rename back the old if you want
[12:30] <n3mu5> lol
[12:31] <alcaprawn> didnt expect a native version of steam for nix *_*
[12:31] <alcaprawn> sweeet
[12:32] <bhavesh> My Unity on Ubuntu 12.04.1 started working incredibly faster when I did "sudo apt-get install --reinstall xserver-xorg-video-intel", anyone has any idea why?
[12:32] <jacklk> lol ^
[12:32] <Third3ye> ok... so I've found a solution, but the solution doesn't work -- since it relies upon a special snapshot of alsa-driver. It's a problem with hp dvx laptops (I have hp dv5). I found it on the help pages for ubuntu, but he source is a bit old (2009) and only works on a Ubuntu 9.04...
[12:33] <jacklk> bhavesh: Maybe because you installed your graphics driver?
[12:33] <jacklk> ActionParsnip: any idea?
[12:33] <jacklk> Should I install a different graphics driver?
[12:33] <alcaprawn> jacklk:
[12:33] <gartral> Third3ye: well.. it's an ugly kludge, but can you live with a usb sound card?
[12:33] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: do other games run?
[12:33] <alcaprawn> do u have ati or nvidia
[12:33] <jacklk> I don't know
[12:33] <jacklk> I don't play games
[12:33] <Third3ye> gartral: not really :P cause I want HDMI to work...
[12:33] <jacklk> I only play Teeworlds ;p
[12:34] <alcaprawn> jacklk: , what gpu do u have?
[12:34] <jacklk> alcaprawn: ATI Radeon HD6290
[12:34] <jacklk> It's integrated into this crappy AMD CPU
[12:34] <alcaprawn> you should try latest beta drivers
[12:34] <alcaprawn> from ati's site
[12:34] <jacklk> mh
[12:34] <alcaprawn> im using them with a 6870 running good enough for now
[12:34] <jacklk> Okay I'll try
[12:34] <bhavesh> jacklk, I already had it installed..
[12:34] <alcaprawn> look at this post.

[12:36] <Robbilie> i really want ubu for phones to be released :(
[12:36] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: tuxcart, frozen bubble, ntry searching software centre
[12:36] <jacklk> alcaprawn: What psot?
[12:36] <bhavesh> Robbilie, Ofcourse it will be released
[12:36] <jacklk> Robbilie: It will probably crash your phone
[12:37] <k1l_> !phone | Robbilie bhavesh jacklk
[12:37] <ubottu> Robbilie bhavesh jacklk: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[12:37] <jacklk> AMD's servers are so slow it takes like 1 hour to download a graphics driver..
[12:37] <sigurding> can anyone tell me how to install a plain server with a core unity desktop? I mean without the whole open office stuff etc
[12:37] <ActionParsnip> Robbilie: imho, its too late and will die off soon
[12:37] <Robbilie> ActionParsnip, i dont think so ;)
[12:38] <Robbilie> it will have great performance over other oss'
[12:38] <cfhowlett> sigurding: purpose of the server?
[12:38] <Robbilie> bhavesh, i guess it will be :D jacklk i have an intel powered phone muhahahan :D
[12:38] <DrCode> hi all
[12:38] <ActionParsnip> Robbilie: considering iphone and android are doing so well, there is little room for a new entry especially at this time
[12:39] <jacklk> ActionParsnip: What desktop envrioment do you use?
[12:39] <DrCode> If I have low video card , can I make gnome run faster?
[12:39] <DrCode> I want to use ubuntu
[12:39] <sigurding> cfhowlett: it shall be a local testing machine with postgres and mongo and I do want to have the admin uis installed on it, because of that I would like to have a desktop
[12:39] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: I don't,  I only use fluxbox these days
[12:39] <sigurding> cfhowlett: it is installed in VM
[12:39] <sigurding> +a
[12:39] <DrCode> no
[12:39] <DrCode> its ati card,
[12:39] <Robbilie> ActionParsnip, i guess like in desktop environments, they dont want to be the biggest but are fine with beeing beside the biggest
[12:39] <jacklk> DrCode: only if you have the latest drivers
[12:39] <ActionParsnip> Drcode: try lxde, it uses a lot fewer resources
[12:39] <cfhowlett> DrCode: if you suspect your hardware is strangling you, consider a different desktop environment: lxde or xfce are both optimized for older, low spec machines
[12:40] <DrCode> no
[12:40] <cfhowlett> sigurding: looking for the right configuration tutorial
[12:40] <Robbilie> DrCode, try archlinux it only takes up about 200mb ram :D
[12:40] <Robbilie> well less
[12:40] <Robbilie> actually
[12:40] <DrCode> its ari SB600
[12:40] <Robbilie> runs smoothon my phone
[12:40] <DrCode> now propl driver
[12:40] <k1l_> Robbilie: stop that offtopic here please
[12:40] <DrCode> ati SB600
[12:41] <Robbilie> k1l_, just adding smthng to what somebody else wrote ;)
[12:41] <Robbilie> k1l_, atm im just here for news bout ubu phone os
[12:41] <sigurding> if have seen --without-recommendations or so, but I did not get to work unity at all, because no applications were accessable
[12:41] <DrCode> ATI RS690 , it say vga in lspci , is there driver?
[12:41] <k1l_> Robbilie: i pointed you to the ubuntu-phone channel. and if you want to support archlinux they got their support servers.
[12:41] <jacklk> Robbilie: you installed Arch Linux?
[12:41] <ActionParsnip> Robbilie: tried tinycore :) 12mb iso
[12:41] <Robbilie> k1l_, dont want to support them but you must admit that it runs smoother on low end hardware...? thanks for the channel, didnt read that
[12:42] <jacklk> ActionParsnip: TinyCore is useless
[12:42] <cfhowlett> sigurding: I THINK this is it.  if not look for something similar ... or ask in #ubuntu-server  http://www.docstoc.com/docs/22211437/How-to-configure-VMWare-WorkstationServer-install-Ubuntu
[12:42] <Robbilie> jacklk, ActionParsnip why useless? arcvh is fine
[12:42] <ActionParsnip> Jacklk: obviously never used a thin client
[12:42] <k1l_> Robbilie: im not gonna admit anything here besides ubuntu support. thats what the channel is for. thanks for sticking to the guidlines
[12:42] <Robbilie> ActionParsnip, just ran it because ubu didnt chroot well
[12:43] <Azmuth> anyone familiar with winetricks ?
[12:43] <sigurding> cfhowlett: I have the server already running under vmware, but I need to know how to install unity-desktop without this whole soft clash
[12:43] <ActionParsnip> Robbilie: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/live-usb-sticking-grub-2-video
[12:43] <MonkeyDust> !anyone
[12:43] <ubottu> A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[12:43] <ActionParsnip> Robbilie: is how I chroot :)
[12:43] <jacklk> Who was "p5DDF9DA9.dip.t-dialin.net"?
[12:43] <cfhowlett> sigurding: OK.  Over my head.  sorry.
[12:43] <Azmuth> ok lol
[12:43] <Emanon> Azmuth: Not directly but PlayOnLinux uses it to some positive ends.
[12:44] <Emanon> If I'm not mistaken that is.
[12:44] <cfhowlett> !wine|azmuth
[12:44] <ubottu> azmuth: WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[12:44] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: try in #winehq as well
[12:44] <Azmuth> i tried but no one answered
[12:44] <Emanon> jacklk: ~Robbilie@p5DDF9DA9.dip.t-dialin.net
[12:45] <Emanon> He was kicking Robbilie in such a way that changing his nick wouldn't let him back in.
[12:45] <Azmuth> i installed directx with winetricks and when i run gta sa it show error "required directx 9.0" ?
[12:45] <sigurding> cfhowlett: ok
[12:45] <Azmuth> any idea
[12:45] <Tashtego> gartral: "Download from this direct-link:".... there are no more files to download. i think i am giving up. downloading from several sites, free packages around all the net and thousands of packages... i dont even know if i can trust 'em. that should not be the way a simple vga driver is installed... :(
[12:46] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: wine is an abstraction for directx, you cannot install directx in wine
[12:46] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: did you check the apodb for x
[12:46] <Robbilie_> man
[12:46] <Azmuth> yes i did
[12:46] <Robbilie_> stop that i didnt do anything
[12:46] <Azmuth> and it work!
[12:46] <Azmuth> 9.0
[12:46] <Andyland> Plus with Steam for linux coming along in a short while (6-18 months) you won't have to W(h)ine anymore :D
[12:47] <Emanon> That is unless he proxies...
[12:47] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: cool, did you scroll down on the psge, is there a how to guide?
[12:47] <Azmuth> i installed it with winetricks...
[12:47] <Emanon> Azmuth: If you like I could walk you through installing DX properly via PlayOnLinux.
[12:47] <Emanon> Since I am somewhat more familiar with that.
[12:48] <ikonia> playonlinux is no better than wine
[12:48] <ikonia> if you want to play a windows game....use windows.
[12:48] <Azmuth> Emanon: do playonlinux support samp injection
[12:48] <Emanon> No it's not but it's easier to use ikonia.
[12:48] <Emanon> I'm not sure Azmuth give me a minute.
[12:48] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: on the appdb there are how to guides
[12:48] <Tashtego> restarting
[12:49] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: try reading the whole page
[12:49] <failor> i heard there is native steam for linux already, is there cs:s on linux without wine?
[12:49] <_kud> Hello
[12:49] <ikonia> failor: check out the steam website for what's available o nlinux
[12:49] <ikonia> on
[12:49] <_kud> Since I've upgraded my ubuntu and some other stuffs, I can't use anymore my keyboard in my cli
[12:49] <_kud> Any idea?
[12:49] <Azmuth> ActionParsnip: can you give me link ?
[12:49] <_kud> I'm on ubuntu server, no Xorg
[12:50] <ActionParsnip> http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=23695
[12:50] <MonkeyDust> failor  http://store.steampowered.com/browse/linux/
[12:50] <_kud> it seems not to be a tmux trouble because when I disable it, it still doesn't work correctly
[12:50] <failor> MonkeyDust, ikonia thx
[12:50] <ActionParsnip> _kud: is the system ca laptop?
[12:50] <Azmuth> i have installed it!
[12:50] <_kud> what?
[12:50] <_kud> No, i'm on desktop
[12:50] <arshavin> failor: yes steam has native linux client,I have it installed took 121 mb of downloading and there only a handfull games available
[12:50] <Emanon> As in Samp SQL Injection for pentesting Azmuth?
[12:50] <_kud> it worked previously
[12:51] <Azmuth> no
[12:51] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: read ALL the page
[12:51] <Azmuth> it inject a dll
[12:51] <failor> arshavin, i already bought uplink and defcon lol
[12:51] <Emanon> So San Andreas Multiplayer?
[12:51] <failor> havn't tried it yet though
[12:51] <Azmuth> yes
[12:51] <arshavin> failor: good for you
[12:51] <_kud> I'm on 3.2.0-35-generic
[12:51] <ActionParsnip> _kud: if you pull the keyboard out, wait a while rhen reinsert, does it work?
[12:52] <Emanon> Alright I've played EverQuest on with PlayOnLinux so I think it can handle SA at least in theory.
[12:52] <_kud> When I connect via root, I have no trouble, ActionParsnip
[12:52] <_kud> :/
[12:52] <_kud> it seems to be my profile but dunno why
[12:52] <_kud> I use zsh
[12:53] <_kud> I will try with root + zsh
[12:53] <ActionParsnip> _kud: if you boot an older kernel,  is it ok
[12:53] <Emanon> In theory POL can do anything wine with winetricks can do since it's just a gui for them. In practice you still have to know what your doing if to a lesser degree than when using wine without it.
[12:53] <_kud> yes, it's zsh.
[12:53] <Third3ye> xD
[12:53] <Azmuth> Emanon: playonlinux use wine ?
[12:53] <_kud> I try with a fresh profile, with bash and zsh
[12:53] <Emanon> Yes.
[12:53] <_kud> and zsh has troubles
[12:54] <Third3ye> It kinda irritates... cause I can't get sound to work. But everytime I reboot I hear this bassdrum like kick when the kernel shuts down
[12:54] <Azmuth> Emanon: how to install it ?
[12:54] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: its always wine doing the work,  the other stuff are just frontends to settings
[12:54] <Emanon> It's just a GUI to handle the rough edges of wine. You can install it from the standard Ubuntu (or possibly partner/nonefree) repos or get the latest version from their site here http://www.playonlinux.com/en/.
[12:55] <Azmuth> ok thx
[12:55] <Emanon> Once you get that installed PM me and I'll tell you how to install DX the easy way.
[12:55] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: what is the output of: apt-cache policy winev| grep -I installed
[12:55] <Azmuth> w8
[12:55] <ActionParsnip> I hate this tablet sometimes
[12:56] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: apt-cache policy wine | grep -i installed
[12:57] <Azmuth> installed: (none)
[12:58] <Azmuth> that's the output
[12:58] <Third3ye> OMG...
[12:58] <Third3ye> Such a simple friggin' fix...
[12:58] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: ok run: sudo apt-get install pastebinit; dpkg -l | grep wine | pastebinit
[12:59] <Third3ye> I just had to add "options intel_hda model=dv5" to alsa-base.conf xD
[12:59] <Third3ye> The internal speakers are working now
[12:59] <ActionParsnip> Third3ye: yeah those are needed sometimes
[12:59] <Emanon> Wait, ActionParsnip there is a way to pipe the output straight to pastebin?
[12:59] <Emanon> That's awesome.
[12:59] <Azmuth> ActionParsnip: done
[13:00] <ActionParsnip> Azmuth: what is the url generated?
[13:00] <Third3ye> Now this irritates me... it worked, untill I logged in and changed the tv to the main display and turned off the laptop display...
[13:00] <Azmuth> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1503146/
[13:00] <Third3ye> Now the sound doesn't work again -.-;;
[13:01] <sw0rdfish_> anyone know a reliable free vpn service?
[13:01] <Third3ye> Though I did hear the drum when lightdm loaded :P
[13:01] <Emanon> You just made my evening ActionParsnip.
[13:02] <failor> sw0rdfish, depends on goals, there r no free and reliable once for hardcore purposes, buy one "double"+
[13:02] <failor> ones*
[13:03] <ActionParsnip> Emanin: sure, pastebinit accepts text streams :)
[13:03] <sw0rdfish_> failor: its just that my vps provider let my current vps expire even though I paid for another one and told him to move the current plan to the new one... so now I'm vpn-less
[13:03] <sw0rdfish_> so to speak
[13:04] <cfhowlett> sw0rdfish: from where?  I ask because I found a non-vpn workaround for FB here in china ...
[13:05] <sw0rdfish_> northern europe
[13:05] <cfhowlett> sw0rdfish: so not to bypass gov't restrictions then ...
[13:05] <Emanon> Couldn't you just use Tor cfhowlett?
[13:06] <cfhowlett> Emanon: maybe, but I'm a casual FB user and my impression is that tor is meant for more worldly matters *syria* *arab spring*
[13:07] <Andyland> sw0rdfish_: Yeah download the Tor browser bundle: https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en. Your DL might be a little slower due to the tunneling but your totally anonomous
[13:07] <Emanon> Hardly. One of the lead Devs mentions it's aid in getting Chinese "citizens" to facebook.
[13:07] <Emanon> WOA Never say something is totally anonymous. That's putting people in danger.
[13:07] <cfhowlett> Emanon: as I said, I've got a workaround ... although I'm certain the gov't is very aware of it.
[13:08] <Emanon> It hasn't been seriously compromised yet and they try to keep it that way.
[13:08] <jacklk> Goodbye Ubuntu, I'm installing Windows 7
[13:08] <sw0rdfish_> i need a vpn
[13:08] <jacklk> finally no more errors
[13:08] <sw0rdfish_> i'm having trouble installing it on my local laptop
[13:09] <Andyland> Emanon: Yes Mr IT security there's no such thing as "totally anonymous" but the Tor project is a pretty good step at getting there you have to admit?
[13:09] <Third3ye> How do I delete the user sound settings?
[13:09] <cfhowlett> sw0rdfish: installing a vpn?
[13:09] <Third3ye> is it in .conf?
[13:09] <jost> jacklk, right... you do know that windows was programmed by Microsoft? So dream on.
[13:09] <failor> tor has serious security issues
[13:09] <Emanon> Definitely I just think it's irresponsible to say it's totally secure. It gives people the impression they don't need to use other methods to protect their identities online as well.
[13:10] <cfhowlett> Emanon: point taken.
[13:10] <sw0rdfish_> cfhowlett: installing openvpn i mean
[13:10] <jacklk> jost: So? Microsoft sucks, but Windows 7 is fine
[13:10] <cfhowlett> sw0rdfish: it won't install?  I am surprised ..
[13:10] <sw0rdfish_> i meant setting up is tough
[13:10] <cfhowlett> sw0rdfish: how are you installing and what feedback are you getting
[13:11] <cfhowlett> sw0rdfish: oh, well yeah...  not the most intuitive.
[13:12] <El-E-Va-Tion> can anybody help me with kppp window disappearing in 12.10?
[13:12] <magik_> I have been having a heck of a time accessing my Ubuntu 12.10 laptop from my gf Windows 8 on the local net using SAMBA so I can get her music on her computer,  Anyone have any ideas?
[13:12] <sw0rdfish_> yeah sorry bout that cfhowlett :)

[13:12] <jacklk> sw0rdfish_: I will set it up for you
[13:13] <Tashtego> already tried unity --reset and unity --reset-icons but that doesnt finish
[13:13] <failor> if u're interested in such kind of solution of course
[13:13] <Tashtego> i fucked up my system :(

[13:14] <failor> sounds like fun
[13:15] <MeanEYE> I need a CPU test program. Can someone suggest somethign?
[13:15] <magik_> For some reason lastleo85 when I try to login from her Windows 8 computer to my SAMBA share it says that she does not have access to the network.  I'm pretty sure I set everything up right but there might be something I'm missing on my end.

[13:35] <magik_> can you see the printer using any other machines?
[13:36] <lruneh> yes. yesterday using windows 7 I could find it,np
[13:36] <lruneh> I've tried following som tutorials on installing drivers, but no luck
[13:37] <magik_> Ok, I personaly have never used a wifi printer except at college.
[13:38] <trol_> Ajam
[13:38] <magik_> What I would suggest you do is set up a share on the windows computer and connect to it through samba but that might even be more of a pain lol.

[13:48] <SpheX> Hello, i just created ubuntu secured remix usb key with LiLI, and when i try to install it says invalid magic number and after thath line you must first install kernel.
[13:48] <SpheX> What should i do?
[13:48] <SpheX> Actualy second line is: you need to load the kernel first
[13:48] <ubuntuaddicted> Tex_Nick, it's beyond me why there is static, never used to be. i recently plugged in a HD PVR and a webcam but even unplugging those still results in static recordings. I mean it still records my voice but also has static and is unacceptable for my youtube videos
[13:49] <Tex_Nick> ubuntuaddicted : ok, there is a common problem with PulseAudio on ubuntu 12.04 & 12.10 it causes audio distortion when using skype and playing multimedia files with VLC
[13:50] <MeanEYE> Does nvidia-experimental-310 support custom compiled kernels?

[13:52] <Tex_Nick> i'm not sure if xubuntu is also affected ... i've had the problem & the fix is easy ... it only requires editing one line in the pulse directory ...; http://askubuntu.com/questions/157891/skype-and-vlc-sounds-sizzle-distorted-bad

[13:54] <Emanon> Bet THAT sounded different in your head too.
[13:55] <nibbler_> john_555: sounds pretty dead
[13:55] <nibbler_> john_555: which is sort of standard behaviour of SSDs
[13:55] <john_555> i tried knoppix and backtrack also nothing
[13:56] <john_555> worked fine so far, after a hybernation it stoped
[13:56] <nibbler_> john_555: its dead as dead can be, leave distros out of that, you bios does not even get it
[13:56] <ubuntuaddicted> Tex_Nick, i don't even have this line: load-module module-hal-detect? I have a line that reads: load-module module-udev-detect
[13:57] <john_555> nibbler_: so there is nothing i can try?
[13:58] <Tex_Nick> ubuntuaddicted : ok that was the same for me ... it fixed me right up ... i've also helped other people here with similar problems ... has helped most of them
[13:58] <nibbler_> john_555: no
[13:58] <ubuntuaddicted> Tex_Nick, my file already has load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0
[13:59] <Tex_Nick> ubuntuaddicted : try editing that line ... i think you need to logout & back in or restart for it to work
[13:59] <john_555> nibbler_: If i could only safe some data from it. howabout forensic tools?
[14:00] <ubuntuaddicted> Tex_Nick, it already had the tsched=0 on the end of the line I am saying.
[14:00] <Tex_Nick> ubuntuaddicted : ah ok an upgrade must have already done it for you ... it's been a pesky problem
[14:00] <GibbaTheHutt> hi, does anyone know where gnome-terminal profiles are stored these days ?

[14:01] <TakeItEZ> john_555: how would forensic tools access the data if the ssd isn't recognized as a drive at all? get back your data from backups

[14:17] <voxadam> I have an old single core netbook with half a gig of ram that isn't good for much, if I were to load a minimal OS and maybe XFCE on to it would it make a decent X client (I know that's not the correct term) to run stuff off my workstation?

[15:20] <Tex_Nick> serhat : ok first i'd just try logout then back in ... if it doesn't restore them ... you can reset the compiz settings
[15:21] <serhat> Tex_Nick, is there a method to reset them all
[15:21] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: installing ethtool now
[15:22] <serhat> Tex_Nick, do you use ubuntu with unity too?
[15:22] <serhat> Tex_Nick, if so can you use those shortcuts?
[15:22] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: check the lines containing "Wake-on"
[15:24] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: hmmm says no such devices
[15:24] <Ubiquity4321> i've enabled it in my power settings
[15:24] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: rel´place ethX with your actual network iface
[15:24] <Ubiquity4321> in bios
[15:24] <Ubiquity4321> oh derp
[15:25] <skp1> i have a question. my video card is a radeon hd 6300. according to my computer details i am using a vesa driver. am i getting the best experience with this?
[15:25] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: "supports wake-on: pumbg"
[15:25] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: "wake-on: d'
[15:25] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: sudo ethtool -s ethX wol g
[15:25] <serhat> Tex_Nick, okay i got it on my own
[15:25] <serhat> Tex_Nick, thanks anyway
[15:25] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: do you use /etc7network/interfaces to configure your network?
[15:26] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: one minute, let me read my man page. i wanna see what i'm doing here
[15:26] <raven> hi
[15:26] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: do you use /etc/network/interfaces to configure your network?
[15:26] <raven> is streamripper able to record 1 hour blocks?
[15:26] <serhat> Tex_Nick, seems like i somehow disabled expo wall, silly me
[15:26] <Tex_Nick> serhat : great, i was looking for the link to fix that ... out of curosity what did you do
[15:26] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: it was automatically set up, but i'll look into that
[15:27] <Tex_Nick> serhat : lol ... ok ;-)
[15:27] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: check /etc/network/interface, add 2 lines after the "iface ethX..."  to enable WoL permanently:
[15:28] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: post-up /usr/sbin/ethtool -s ethX wol g
[15:28] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: post-down /usr/sbin/ethtool -s ethX wol g
[15:30] <raven> is streamripper able to record 1 hour blocks?
[15:31] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: it's all written
[15:31] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: " /usr/sbin/ethtool -s ethX wol g" simply tells the given network-iface to wake on magic-packets, nothing dangerous :)
[15:31] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: tbh, i was only curious what -s did
[15:33] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: -s "change". so restart your network-iface, bring the machine down and wake it up from a different one using etherwake or a similar tool
[15:33] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: well, i want to wol from a windows box
[15:33] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: i dual-boot fedora and win7
[15:33] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: there are wol-tools for windows also, i just cannot name one
[15:35] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: could you assist me with the headless part as well?
[15:36] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: headless as in remote X?
[15:36] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: headless as in remote command line
[15:36] <nemos> Hello i have problem seting nomodset. My grub is black and not pink with F6 options
[15:36] <TakeItEZ> !ssh | Ubiquity4321  simply use ssh

[15:36] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: well, i've got xming installed and configured
[15:37] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: but i don't know how to connect the two
[15:37] <nemos> Hello i have problem seting nomodset. My grub is black and not pink with F6 options
[15:37] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: xming is an Xserver for windows, thats not commandline
[15:37] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: and i've got openssh installed on the linux box
[15:37] <Mkop1> so I have come to the realization that ubuntu 12.10 is not made for my 5 year old laptop. what should I downgrade to? 10.04 LTS?

[15:38] <Third3ye> Mkop1: you could trim the components...
[15:38] <Third3ye> Mkop1: remove unity, install xfce...
[15:38] <jrib> Mkop1: try xfce or lxde (xubuntu-desktop and lubuntu-desktop packages will give you the option at login for them)
[15:38] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: ohhhh. i'll just use putty then
[15:39] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: use putty from windows to connect to the linux-box and you're done
[15:39] <nemos> I need help. How can i start with nomodset if my grub is black with no F6 options?
[15:39] <kylescottmcgill> Mkop1: if you are really keen to skimp on resources, you should out a Tiling Window Manager, or OpenBox
[15:39] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: i thought it would be harder than that. thank you
[15:39] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: from fedora, use "ssh user@box"   box= yourlinux.box
[15:39] <TakeItEZ> Ubiquity4321: and if you don't want to use X-apps remotely, you can remove xming, no need for it then
[15:40] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: you're so knowledgeable and helpful
[15:40] <Ubiquity4321> TakeItEZ: thank you so much
[15:40] <nemos> I need help. How can i start with nomodset if my grub is black with no F6 options?
[15:40] <Mkop1> jrib: if I just apt-get install lubuntu-desktop I can just log out and the login screen will give me an option to use those desktop managers instead of unity?
[15:40] <jrib> Mkop1: yes

[15:41] <Mkop1> I don't get why, for example, gnome-system-monitor is currently using 27% of CPU.
[15:41] <nibbler_> nemos: you could boot from cd and fix it from there...
[15:42] <nemos> kylescottmcgill, you missunderstood my grub doesnt look pink its black. I dont have F6 option
[15:42] <nemos> nibler_, i am trying to boot from live cd
[15:43] <volpone> ciaoa tutti
[15:43] <nemos> but my grub looks black with options to install or try its not pink. Therefore i dont have F2, F3,F4,F5 and F6 options
[15:44] <kylescottmcgill> i havnt seen grub look pink before, its always been black for me, as for not having a F6 option, boot into a live cd, chroot your ubuntu install and change the grub cfg line, and reboot again
[15:44] <nemos> i see the grub. Its just black with options to press C to edit commands and some other. Escape gets me to bash commands
[15:44] <kylescottmcgill> i think you can bash tab as well, and it will take it out of splash screen mode, or allow you to do something... argh memory is a little hazy :)
[15:44] <kylescottmcgill> ok
[15:44] <kylescottmcgill> cool
[15:45] <john_555> what is a good brand ssd in the 120gb range for ubuntu. my adata ssd just died.
[15:45] <kylescottmcgill> when you see that grub screen can you see your boot options?
[15:45] <kylescottmcgill> nemos: ^
[15:45] <TakeItEZ> john_555: there is none, they all suffer from early deads
[15:45] <compdoc> john_555, do you set the options for ssd in your fstab?
[15:46] <nemos> kylescottmcgill, i can see the try before install, install and so on
[15:46] <kylescottmcgill> :/ i have a vertex 4 by OCZ, i hope it doesnt die.....
[15:46] <kylescottmcgill> nemos: so you booted the live cd?
[15:47] <john_555> compdoc: no, and it is too late anyway, if i plug it in the ide it is not recognized by bios
[15:48] <compdoc> john_555, how old is the adata?
[15:48] <arrrghhh> Hey all.  Can I "uninstall" LVM?  I put LVM over some already formatted ext4 drives and I'm hoping my data is still OK....
[15:48] <kylescottmcgill> john_555: does it heat up when you turn it on? (even if the bios doesnt see it)
[15:48] <nemos> kylescottmcgill, yes. I am trying to try the ubuntu before install and i get a freeze because of my graphic card so the solution is to boot with nomodset
[15:49] <kylescottmcgill> nemos: ok before we continue, do you have ubuntu installed already?
[15:49] <kylescottmcgill> or are you actually just trying it out?
[15:49] <nemos> kylescottmcgill: no i dont. I tried to install it with wubi but it cannot see the install file after reboot so i am trying this instead
[15:49] <john_555> compdoc: 6mnds     kylescottmcgill: yes, a bit

[15:50] <michael_2> nemos, have you selected the "try it out" option and pressed the 'e' key to go to the boot options menu?
[15:51] <kylescottmcgill> nemos: ok then, please re-read that forum i posted you, if you have a recent version of Ubuntu (12.10) you should see those options, if you have a special keyboard trying holding the function key prior to pressing F6 for other options
[15:51] <nemos> michael_2: so i need to navigte to try before install and then press E?
[15:52] <nemos> kylescottmcgill: i dont see the normal grub options thats why i am asking what to do
[15:52] <michael_2> nemos: depending on your live cd setup, that might give you some options.  I've never tried it from a live cd, however, so I can't confirm if it wil work.
[15:52] <nemos> kylescottmcgill: the grub looks like if you dualboot and have few versions of linux and one windows.
[15:53] <kylescottmcgill> john_555: if i was you, i wouldnt put it back into your computer, let it sit over night and try it in someone elses computer, just incase, something might have gone wrong and your bios has gone all crazy on your ssd... otherwise, i have a OCZ Vertex 4 128 GB, and its bliss, and its cheap

[15:59] <ccsteale> ankur, if the disk works in your laptop, chances are it could be an issue with the drive itself

[15:59] <michael_2> ankur: download again and make sure to use a supported live cd creation tool
[15:59] <ankur> u mean my hard drive

[16:10] <Petaz> i just google it im using windows
[16:10] <ankur> my problem is isolinux disk error 80, ax=4280, drive 9f, and i tried to boot my laptop with the same cd and it did
[16:10] <alein> if you want to remove all rules use iptables -F
[16:10] <Petaz> i dont know anything about linux
[16:11] <MonkeyDust> ankur  i read on several non-ubuntu forums, that the problem is solved, when the iso is burned with another burner

[16:11] <ankur> i got this cd frm my friend
[16:11] <TheLordOfTime> sw0rdfish_, then iptables-save > /etc/iptables.save
[16:11] <alein> sw0rdfish_ ok then use iptables-restore -c /etc/iptables.save
[16:11] <ankur> and it is running on my laptop but not on the desktop
[16:11] <TheLordOfTime> sw0rdfish_, although i strongly suggest you look into iptables-persistent if you want to autoload rules or something.
[16:11] <ankur> i just want to know why
[16:11] <TheLordOfTime> ankur, repeating yourself will not help.  you've been given plenty of answers

[16:20] <yousaf_> that is a risk, i might have KVM access
[16:20] <yousaf_> is that better?

[16:22] <kylescottmcgill> php -f will run php files as commands... kinda, to fork them to the background can be done in many ways, and you will need to correct way in order to have it hooked up to which ever system your using
[16:23] <kylescottmcgill> a correct way**

[16:27] <McPels> hi
[16:27] <michael_2> Owiec: You might want to try adjusting your partition tables using a Windows utility before the install.  Then select the new partition manually during the Ubuntu install.
[16:27] <McPels> How can I format a flash memory in Ubuntu 12.10?!!
[16:27] <jacklk> If my USB drive is /dev/sdd then what would the root path be to it? I want to use mv to copy a file to it.
[16:28] <jacklk> McPels: Install GParted

=== Guest17317 is now known as hack
[16:28] <jacklk> McPels: sudo apt-get install gparted -y, find your USB device, make a new partition table and FAT partitio.

[16:28] <Owiec> michael_2: i use http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg309170.aspx to create new partition with 70 GB, its empty but ubuntu still can see this.
[16:28] <kylescottmcgill> nemos: you might need to bite the bullet, and either install Ubuntu or try the mentioned work arounds
[16:28] <kapcom01> thanks.
[16:29] <kylescottmcgill> nemos: i was going to suggest to drop into a terminal, but you wont be able to login i think
[16:29] <Owiec> michael_2: i cant even click new partition because all crush then
[16:29] <kylescottmcgill> does anyone know if the root user is unlocked in the livecd?
[16:29] <MonkeyDust> kylescottmcgill  there is no root, there is sudo
[16:30] <michael_2> Owiec: Have you tried using the "try ubuntu" option with the live cd yet?
[16:30] <Guest90562> Any one please
[16:30] <kylescottmcgill> MonkeyDust: so if you swap to TTY do you just enter root as the user name?
[16:30] <kylescottmcgill> TTY1 **
[16:30] <nemos> kylescottmcgill: so it will work if i install instead of try to run it from livecd?
[16:30] <bekks> Guest90562: You cant, since you wont have that much space locally. You'll need several hundreds of Gigabytes to do so.
[16:31] <Owiec> michael_2: mayby the problem is sony vaio has hybrid disk? (32 GB SSD)
[16:31] <SailorMoon> How do i start Ubuntu in a Terminal?
[16:31] <MonkeyDust> kylescottmcgill  nu, you can use su -i, but be careful, it basically turns your pc into a windows machine, nobody wants that
[16:31] <xxkoncyxx> hy everybody
[16:31] <McPels> jacklk: is there any other way?
[16:31] <Owiec> michael_2: yes, i tried this and livecd see disk and data
[16:31] <k1l> Guest90562: just download it with firefox?
[16:31] <kylescottmcgill> MonkeyDust: lol you mean sudo -i ?
[16:31] <michael_2> SailorMoon: Are you asking how to make Ubuntu start in console mode by default instead of GUI mode?
[16:31] <kylescottmcgill> MonkeyDust: this is for nemos
[16:32] <jacklk> McPels: Using GParted is easier
[16:32] <jacklk> McPels: look on YouTube how to do it -- I've seen some videos it's simple
[16:32] <jacklk> search for a guide online
[16:32] <Guest90562> bekkk, k1l  Then how people download wiki ,   i think one of my old friend downloaded it of 25 g
[16:32] <mfdoom> if I download ubuntu desktop 12.04, can I do a core install from that? Or will it automatically install recommends and such?
[16:32] <kylescottmcgill> he cant boot into a livecd "try Ubuntu" due to some GFX issues on some of the later Mobo's
[16:32] <michael_2> Owiec: You could try adjusting the partition tables from Ubuntu in live cd test mode
[16:32] <xxkoncyxx> i have lubuntu 10.04on my Asus Eee PC 701SD.  Is there any way to install kde, openbox oe gnome onlubuntu?
[16:33] <k1l> Guest90562: that is different from "downloading a website". you should look out for a wikidump. but that is not a ubuntu support question. better ask the wiki support
[16:33] <dufa> Guest9041: you can use the command wget with -r to download a site recursively
[16:33] <kylescottmcgill> nemos: you could give it a shot, i cant promise its going to work, but according to the link you pasted me, there is a way around some of those issues, plus i have seen other users with your GFX Card running Ubuntu, so i know it works, but im not 100% sure about your Mobo sorry

[16:34] <Owiec> michael_2: what exatly should i do?
[16:34] <michael_2> Owiec: After booting into test mode, use the GParted app to modify the partition tables.
[16:34] <McPels> jacklk: sorry, I cannot have access to you tube now! in previous versions of ubuntu, by a right click i could simply find the "format" choice in the list, do you know why in this version this does not exist?
[16:35] <xxkoncyxx> any hungarian? :)
[16:35] <kylescottmcgill> michael_2: can you change the partition type in gparted? (out of curiosity)
[16:35] <xxkoncyxx> whats your problem with your pc?
[16:35] <Owiec> michael_2: test mode?
[16:36] <Owiec> michael_2: you mean "try ubuntu"?
[16:36] <xxkoncyxx> please write it and i'll help, if i can :)
[16:36] <jacklk> McPels: because the newer versions of Ubuntu suck
[16:36] <jacklk> :(
[16:36] <jacklk> It's true
[16:36] <michael_2> Owiec: Exactly
[16:36] <jacklk> McPels: Just search for a simple command online how to
[16:36] <kylescottmcgill> xxkoncyxx: you can install most Window Managers, or Desktop Managers, i have Awesome WM, and Gnome 3 running
[16:36] <michael_2> kylescottmcgill: You mean from ext2 to ext3 and such?
[16:36] <xxkoncyxx> ubuntu's problem is he unity..
[16:37] <michael_2> Unity is great.  :D
[16:37] <jacklk> McPels: ever since the introduction to unity it's lost many of it's features
[16:37] <kylescottmcgill> michael_2: nah, sorry i was meaning GPT to MBR, so the Partition Record Type
[16:37] <xxkoncyxx> and you can downloada parted linux with unetbootin
[16:37] <t2mahesh> i like Unity then gnome 3.4+
[16:38] <xxkoncyxx> i'm using lxde, 'cause i have an asus eee pc 701sd
[16:38] <McPels> jacklk: thank you
[16:38] <michael_2> kylescottmcgill: I don't think so, but I could be wrong.  I use system-config-lvm for most of my partitioning needs.
[16:38] <xxkoncyxx> for partitions you can use a Partition Magic or something like this
[16:39] <Owiec> michael_2: or mayby exist other way to install ubuntu? some other instalator, mayby in text mode usign other tool to disk?
[16:39] <kylescottmcgill> i see, i might have a look later, i want to change my partition type to MBR and try Classic BIOS on my Macbook... without bricking it
[16:39] <xxkoncyxx> write it to cd or cop to a bootable pendrive, and woala it works
[16:39] <jacklk> xxkoncyxx: On your ASUS Eee PC did you have any compatibility problems? Mine, and I've seen many others are really bad with linux
[16:40] <Owiec> michael_2: gparted see all partiations
[16:40] <Owiec> michael_2: and all is corect
[16:40] <xxkoncyxx> jacklk: i havent got an problem with lubuntu 10.04.. i use it in live mode now, i just installed. ubuntu 11 not works
[16:41] <jacklk> xxkoncyxx: ok
[16:41] <michael_2> Owiec: Does it say that any of them are LVM partitions?
[16:41] <xxkoncyxx> i want to install openbox or gnome to lubunu
[16:41] <xxkoncyxx> *lubuntu
[16:42] <Justice> hm for some reason unity webapps are not working with ubuntu
[16:42] <Justice> tried firefox and chromeium
[16:42] <jacklk> xxkoncyxx: How much RAM does it have?
[16:42] <Justice> but nothings aks about integration and nothing in sound panel
[16:42] <xxkoncyxx> 512Mb
[16:42] <Justice> any ideas?
[16:42] <Owiec> michael_2: i dont see any text info "LVM" in any coulumn in any partitions so i guess no
[16:42] <xxkoncyxx> i want to buy 1gb to it :)
[16:42] <kylescottmcgill> xxkoncyxx: you should be able to just sudo apt-get install openbox
[16:43] <xxkoncyxx> thanks :)
[16:43] <MonkeyDust> xxkoncyxx  what's the output of lsb_release -sd ?
[16:43] <kylescottmcgill> also in your autostart file make sure you add gnome-keyring-daemon
[16:43] <michael_2> Owiec: I think you told me earlier that you already have a partition set aside for Ubuntu.  You could use GParted to format THAT partition as ext2 or something and then rerun the installer.
[16:43] <xxkoncyxx> i'm in live mode now
[16:44] <xxkoncyxx> but it worth a try to get information:D
[16:44] <MonkeyDust> xxkoncyxx  of what ubuntu version?
[16:44] <xxkoncyxx> lubuntu 10.04
[16:44] <kylescottmcgill> whats live mode.. is that the live cd?
[16:44] <auronandace> xxkoncyxx: lubuntu wasn't official at 10.04
[16:44] <Owiec> michael_2: ok i will try that, give me a 3 minuts. Yes i have parition for ubuntu but not formated before.
[16:44] <MonkeyDust> xxkoncyxx  it will soon be !eol, don't struggle with it, better use 12.04 or 12.10
[16:45] <xxkoncyxx> i tried, but it was too slow
[16:45] <MonkeyDust> xxkoncyxx  and the other is too old
[16:45] <michael_2> xxkoncyxx: Try Xubuntu
[16:45] <xxkoncyxx> live usb drive :)
[16:46] <F3Speech> Having a problem with my cifs network shares after extetended idle on server, is there any way to tell the server not to sleep/suspend etc. so when services go to access the shares they are always there. Thanks
[16:46] <xxkoncyxx> will it work? i mean it would be great to use it, but i want a fast os :)
[16:47] <jacklk> xxkoncyxx: Openbox is very fast
[16:47] <auronandace> xxkoncyxx: try lubuntu 12.04
[16:47] <jacklk> But it can be hard to get working nicely
[16:47] <xxkoncyxx> okay
[16:47] <jacklk> I've given up on it
[16:47] <jacklk> heh
[16:47] <xxkoncyxx> it worth a try
[16:48] <kylescottmcgill> xxkoncyxx: you should try ubuntu remix, or arch linux if you are looking for faster, but you should look at having at least 1GB of ram :)
[16:48] <xxkoncyxx> to update
[16:48] <xxkoncyxx> i have 512mb in it, but i want to expand itwhen i will have money for it
[16:48] <Hwkiller> arch won't be "faster"; if you need speed, use a different DE
[16:48] <Petaz> yes use e17
[16:48] <Hwkiller> I recommend xfce for a good balance of speed and features
[16:49] <xxkoncyxx> thanks :)
[16:49] <xxkoncyxx> i've never tried xfce
[16:49] <xxkoncyxx> only lxde
[16:49] <xxkoncyxx> and kde
[16:49] <Hwkiller> kde is good. I find lxde to be lacking compared to other DEs
[16:49] <xxkoncyxx> unity is not for me :D
[16:49] <Petaz> lxde is lighter that cface
[16:50] <Petaz> e17 is even lighter
[16:50] <xxkoncyxx> i'll think aboutit
[16:50] <Hwkiller> honestly, gnome-shell is lighter than compiz :p

[16:57] <cuqa> you can also use ubuntu with root password and without sudo .. some providers do that to their vservers

[16:57] <zwirc> milamber: ok tnx will try

[16:57] <zwirc> kylescottmcgill: yea
[16:58] <MonkeyDust> lovepenguin  better repeat it then, but not too often, this is a busy channel
[16:58] <michael_2> Owiec: Manual installation can be extremely difficult.  The only easy option is to use the installer.  Have you tried redownloading and reburning the install disk in case of a corrupt copy?
[16:58] <lovepenguin> I've got an Asus q200e and I need a touchscreen-compatible operating system, is Ubuntu ready for that use case?
[16:58] <kylescottmcgill> zwirc: also, if you are running gnome, i would open System Settings, Under packages or software there are some options, about mirrors, get Ubuntu to find the one you want, and then try to sudo apt-get update ;
[16:59] <Owiec> michael_2: no i didnt try, i think all is ok. I also found that problem in google but i didnt find the solution
[17:00] <Owiec> michael_2: i can install manualy, give hint to some documentation
[17:00] <cuqa> lovepenguin:  ubuntu offers you to try ubuntu without the need to install it. so you can try it out. just download latest ubuntu iso and get it on a stick

=== Celene is now known as callie
[17:02] <michael_2> Owiec: I'm not aware of a resource for manual installation.  It would basically involve manually setting up GRUB, setting up your swap partition, and copying all the files manually.  Then you would have to manually configure everything.  It would be a very difficult process.
[17:02] <zwirc> tnx for help, got PHP 5.4 now =)

[17:03] <kylescottmcgill> michael_2: there is the minimal version of ubuntu, its like 30 MB, and then you can tasksel to get most things set up
[17:03] <lovepenguin> One other thing - can you install 32 bit ubuntu on a 64 bit compatible laptop?
[17:03] <wting> How do I forcefully shut down a program (xbmc) when my system is locked and I can't move the mouse?
[17:03] <lovepenguin> Just for compatibility I mean
[17:03] <milamber> lovepenguin: yes, and i would actually recommend it for a new user
[17:03] <wting> or, what's the Ubuntu equivalent of ctrl+alt+del?
[17:03] <lovepenguin> Thanks guys!
[17:03] <michael_2> Owiec: Check what kylescottmcgill just said.  That might be your best option.
[17:03] <dartos> wting: You mean task manager?
[17:04] <milamber> lovepenguin: depending on how much ram you have you may want to enable pae
[17:04] <dartos> wting: if you want to kill something that froze run xkill in the term and click on the frozen window
[17:04] <wting> dartos: I want to force quit a program that's not responding, through GUI so my mom can do it.
[17:04] <kylescottmcgill> Owiec: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD you can this out
[17:05] <dartos> wting: ah... if you hit alt-f2 then type in xkill it would still work... but thats all I got for ya
[17:05] <wting> dartos: Mouse was unresponsive, I could not bring up terminal. I had to drop to tty1 and use kill -9, but I need a mom-friendly method.
[17:05] <dartos> wting: alt-f2 then xkill
[17:05] <dartos> xkill is not hard to remember
[17:05] <kylescottmcgill> Owiec: http://wiki.debian.org/tasksel then you can install Desktop Enviroment, and sudo apt-get install gnome-desktop (if you want gnome)
[17:05] <dartos> and if she can remember ctrl-alt-del then she can get alt-f2
[17:06] <Random832> unless the keyboard is also unresponsive
[17:06] <dartos> Random832: then you reboot :P
[17:06] <wting> Perhaps, but the bigger issue is why does xbmc crashing lead to an unresponsive mouse / keyboard.
[17:06] <Random832> might have to restart the computer - it's _possible_ for a program on windows to get it wedged so that you can't start the task manager, too, just less likely
[17:06] <wting> i.e. why does a userspace program have the ability to halt X?
[17:06] <Random832> alternately, you could set up sshd, so that when your mom calls you you can fix it remotely
[17:07] <kylescottmcgill> Teamviwer is great
[17:07] <wting> Random832: It's already set up, but you and I know that's a poor long-term solution.

[17:07] <TheLordOfTime> mario_7, select what to boot from at BIOS.
[17:07] <wting> Random832: Yes.
[17:08] <Random832> you could set up a script that finds whatever program is taking up the cpu or whatever and kills it, and put an icon on the other computer that runs it
[17:08] <TheLordOfTime> mario_7, you may have to tell your system to boot from CD, rather than recovery.

[17:09] <Random832> the script itself would reside on the ubuntu system, all you need on windows is to run a ssh command to start it
[17:09] <Owiec> hmm i have one question more: i see ubuntu has now option to save change in system in live usb. I need linux only to code in Ruby On Rails, so mayby it will work in that way on live usb? Or it is stupid idea?
[17:09] <dartos> is the cedarview-graphics-drivers package for ubuntu
[17:09] <Random832> mario_7: How exactly was TheLordOfTime's nick meant to be formatted in your last line?
[17:09] <Ubiquity> hello all
[17:09] <wting> Random832: There's no easy GUI way to kill programs, especially when X is frozen. On Windows, ctr+alt+del *always* works except in BSODs.
[17:09] <Nekura> kylescottmcgill: still no idea what's wrong with sudoers: http://pastebin.com/tSAf5exj
[17:10] <Ubiquity> I'm on my last big hurdle of a project
[17:10] <milamber> Owiec: it's not a bad idea, but persistent usb installs are not able to update kernel or the like
[17:10] <greyduck> this is way above me
[17:10] <Ubiquity> I need to enable wake on lan
[17:10] <Random832> wting: my point is, you write a script, in python or whatever, on ubuntu, to find the bad problem and kill it
[17:10] <greyduck> better look for ubuntu noobs
[17:10] <Random832> then you have an icon you click on the windows system to ssh into the ubuntu system and runs the script
[17:10] <Owiec> milamber: but what with performance?
[17:10] <kylescottmcgill> lolol
[17:10] <Ubiquity> I've set it up in the bios
[17:10] <mario_7> Random832, huh?
[17:11] <Random832> mario_7: <mario_7> HTheLordOfTimeH, pc boots from cd, when i choose LiveCD mode...
[17:11] <kylescottmcgill> Nekura: kyle ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
[17:11] <Random832> i'm trying to figure out what those weird H's were supposed to be
[17:11] <milamber> Owiec: obviously there would be a performance decrease, and i would always recommend a full install of the linux
[17:11] <kylescottmcgill> is the line you need
[17:11] <greyduck> tatty bye!
[17:11] <Random832> was it in like bold, italic, blinking rainbow sprinkles, or what?
[17:11] <kylescottmcgill> Nekura: you also need to log out and login before this will work properly
[17:11] <Nekura> kylescottmcgill: ohhh. that'd help huh lol.
[17:11] <cuqa> so what Ubiquity? whats the problem
[17:11] <milamber> greyduck: this channel is for new user support
[17:11] <Nekura> thanks ;p
[17:11] <mario_7> Random832, I can see it properly, x-chat's fault?
[17:12] <kylescottmcgill> then after that you can sudo <command> and it wont ask you for your password... please be careful though, it is bad practise :)
[17:12] <Random832> mario_7: you can see _what_ properly, is my question
[17:12] <Ubiquity> cuqa: well, i have it set up in linux, as far as i can tell. And I have a program on windows to wake it up
[17:12] <TheLordOfTime> Random832, that's your end.
[17:12] <Ubiquity> cuqa: but it's not waking up
[17:12] <Random832> i have no way to know what it's supposed to be, _because_ i don't ...DAMMIT
[17:12] <TheLordOfTime> Random832, and not a question related directly to this channel.
[17:12] <Random832> I want to know what font the nick is in so that I know what that control character does, IS THAT SO HARD?
[17:12] <Random832> like ctrl-b does bold, ctrl-_ does underline, ctrl-c does color, what does ctrl-h doe
[17:13] <Random832> do*
[17:13] <Nekura> kylescottmcgill: no one else has access to my box. If I could just give it nopasswd without the ALL part that specifies command privileges ( or atleast i think it does) i'd be set
[17:13] <TheLordOfTime> Random832, which irc client
[17:13] <Random832> ....whatever mario_7 is using
[17:13] <mario_7> x-chat
[17:13] <Random832> all i want to know is what font the nick was supposed to be in
[17:13] <Nekura> I'm not familiar with the format of sudoers, so I will now become accustomed with man sudoers lol
[17:13] <kylescottmcgill> Nekura: trust me, use that line as it is and replace kyle with your username, the all in those means all commands
[17:13] <mario_7> i see it as clear text
=== Bladerunner is now known as Bladerunn
[17:13] <Nekura> cool, thanks.
[17:13] <Ubiquity> cuqa: i've set up ethtools
[17:13] <mario_7> and i didn;t add any formatting if you ask about it :P
[17:14] <Nekura> I put no doubt in you lol.
[17:14] <kylescottmcgill> Nekura: :)
[17:14] <kylescottmcgill> lol
[17:14] <cuqa> did you once try to wake it up manually?
[17:15] <DarkPrince946> Hello, anyone got any experience with nxserver?
[17:15] <bekks> !anyone | DarkPrince946
[17:15] <ubottu> DarkPrince946: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[17:15] <Ubiquity> cuqa: you mean, by pressing the power button
[17:15] <kylescottmcgill> Nekura: also, sudo su <user> is what you need too
[17:15] <Ubiquity> cuqa: yes, that works
[17:15] <cuqa> i mean by sending a magic packet
[17:15] <ska> I have a lot of old kernels in my grub.cfg file. Many are long gone. How do I fix/clean it?
[17:15] <bekks> kylescottmcgill: Wrong. HE needs to use sudo -i     --- sudo su is a bad idea
[17:15] <mario_7> TheLordOfTime, is it because of Ubuntu CD choosing to boot recovery partition insted of its own contents or rarther it's PC choice to boot revocery partition when it detects Ubuntu CD?
[17:15] <cuqa> or by  using wol by your router
[17:16] <LastRitesGames> hi, can anyone point me in the right direction for creating (for distributing) a package of software i wrote?
[17:16] <Ubiquity> cuqa: i have tried. I use WakeMeOnLan in Win7
[17:16] <kylescottmcgill> bekks: not if that user isnt root
[17:16] <Ubiquity> cuqa: the box is running ubuntu 12.04 server
[17:16] <cuqa> I think WOL does not have much things to do which os you use
[17:16] <kylescottmcgill> sudo -i will drop you into interactive sudo as root, sudo su will force you into that user
[17:17] <cuqa> u activated it in bios, right?
[17:17] <DarkPrince946> NXServer is disconnecting me with a Server configuration error, looking at the logs its getting a permission denied when it trys to create a directory.
[17:17] <DarkPrince946> I'm not quite sure what to do.
[17:17] <bekks> kylescottmcgill: without specifying a user, it will force you into the root user....
[17:17] <bekks> kylescottmcgill: So sudo .i is the better solution.
=== yakster_ is now known as yakster
[17:17] <kylescottmcgill> bekks: the pastie has more info, he/she is adding a user, and trying to su into that user
[17:17] <kylescottmcgill> not root
[17:18] <Ubiquity> cuqa: i know. just giving as much info as possible. I'll try to wol from my router
[17:18] <mz`> explain diff between "sudo su - <user> -c [command]" and "sudo -i [command]"
[17:19] <kylescottmcgill> sudo -i is going to use sudo interactively, su is to become that user, sudo su, is going to force yourself into the user, so the end results are different
[17:19] <dartos> Can someone please tell me how to get X working on a netbook with Cedar Trail?
[17:19] <alhirzel> I need to edit a .glade file that targets GTK 2.16, how can I install a really old version of Glade?
[17:19] <MonkeyDust> mz`  #bash
[17:20] <bekks> dartos: Whats Cedar Trail?
[17:20] <dartos> bekks: chipset...
[17:20] <mz`> hahaaa
[17:20] <dartos> bekks: X won't start
[17:20] <auronandace> alhirzel: that would be problematic
[17:20] <dartos> It used to work but then NOPE
[17:20] <troop> while installing Tahoma i broke my ubuntu. now i cant login. actually login and logout same time and its not becoming only gdm. even console..
[17:20] <bekks> dartos: After youz changed what exactly?
[17:20] <troop> :)
[17:21] <dartos> bekks: the OS
[17:21] <dartos> bekks: from lubuntu 12.04 to fedora 17 and now back to lubuntu 12.04
[17:21] <dartos> and lubuntu no longer wants to startx
[17:21] <dartos> so it's a fresh install
[17:21] <bekks> dartos: So basically you have an Intel Atom with an integrated graphics chipset.
[17:21] <kylescottmcgill> troop: try jumping into TTY1 (ALT + CTRL + F1) login, and sudo service gdm restart
[17:22] <dartos> bekks: yeah my laptop is gateway lt4004u
[17:22] <kylescottmcgill> troop: or lightdm, which ever one your using
[17:22] <troop> kylescottmcgill,  as i said i cant login on tty too
[17:22] <mz`> missing devices in /dev
[17:22] <bekks> troop: did you set a password for that user?
[17:22] <mz`> use a live cd and chroot in your system disk, then debug
[17:22] <troop> yes bekks my identically user.
[17:24] <dartos> Does anyone know.. this is kind of urgent
[17:24] <troop> i ran this script and restart pc http://paste.org/59748
[17:24] <alhirzel> auronandace: I agree. I am finding a sufficiently old .deb and I am gonna try to force it.
[17:24] <troop> and now i cant login even on tty
[17:24] <cuqa> do you see bootloader?
[17:25] <auronandace> alhirzel: you will likely break something
[17:25] <dartos> dammt
[17:25] <troop> cuqa, me?
[17:25] <cuqa> yes
[17:25] <roadfish> want to drop reserved-blocks-percentage on ext4 from 5% to 1%. is a 3TB hdd holding large, static video files. is 1% a safe value? will I get bad behavior if I drop to 1%
[17:25] <alhirzel> auronandace: yep, I sure wish this project would just upgrade their files! =]
[17:25] <bekks> troop: Did you boot a live cd and checked wether you have a full disk?
[17:25] <troop> i can see everything.  i can see gdm login screen look im trying to telling you. ubuntu login normally but logout at the sametime.
[17:26] <troop> bekks no: fresh install on 250gb now im writing in live cd
[17:26] <troop> im saying my problem started with that script
[17:26] <blaz_> hi.... when i try ''vconfig add eth0 2''     i get    ''WARNING:  Could not open /proc/net/vlan/config.  Maybe you need to load the 8021q module, or maybe you are not using PROCFS??ERROR: trying to add VLAN #2 to IF -:eth0:-  error: Operation not permitted''
[17:26] <kylescottmcgill> troop: you tried a reboot i take it?
[17:26] <alhirzel> auronandace: hold the phone, i think glade-gtk2 will work. False alarm then!
[17:26] <troop> i tried tty too. writing my username and pass it welcomes me but logout at the sametime
[17:27] <troop> kylescottmcgill, yes
[17:27] <kylescottmcgill> nothing in that script looks wrong :s
[17:27] <troop> before this script i had installed mscorefonts
[17:28] <troop> i think there is a serious bug. because i cant login
[17:28] <jhutchins_wk> troop: Can you log in on a console?
[17:28] <troop> i cant login from anywhere
[17:28] <blaz_> anyone
[17:28] <troop> jhutchins_wk,  no
[17:28] <kylescottmcgill> blaz_: try with sudo
[17:28] <troop> it log me in then logout again
[17:29] <ma_> hello everyone :)
[17:29] <cuqa> have you tried different users troop?
[17:29] <kylescottmcgill> troop: if you cant login via the console, you will need to chroot, and check your profile or something
[17:29] <troop> yes
[17:29] <troop> i tried guest user
[17:29] <jhutchins_wk> troop: Is there more than one user on the system?

[17:30] <troop> how will i do kylescottmcgill  ?
[17:30] <Devilbird> Guys, i installed ubuntu with the windows installer, but when i restart i get the following message: https://www.dropbox.com/s/x7c78tb7jpyzwh9/2013-01-06%2018.23.08.jpg (dutch) i tried installing again but it does not help
[17:30] <jhutchins_wk> troop: Can you log in as the guest user?
[17:30] <troop> now i reach my system files
[17:30] <troop> jhutchins_wk, i cant login anykind
[17:31] <kylescottmcgill> troop: what do you mean you reached your system files? are in a livecd?
[17:31] <troop> yes im in a livecd
[17:31] <kylescottmcgill> troop: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCdRecovery <-- everything you would need is here if you can get to it
[17:32] <troop> i installed 12.10 then updated then installed infinality then installed mscorefonts then installed this script and boom.
[17:32] <troop> okay im reading kylescottmcgill
[17:32] <kylescottmcgill> you should just be able to sudo chroot /mnt
[17:32] <kylescottmcgill> after mounting it sorry
[17:33] <jhutchins_wk> troop: Take a look at the logfiles, I'm betting they'll have a font error.
[17:33] <Zaki-Sama> Hi
[17:33] <troop> jhutchins_wk,  where are logfiles?
[17:33] <kylescottmcgill> /var/log

[17:33] <ubottu> mariorgrossi, please see my private message
[17:33] <troop> ok im looking
[17:33] <bekks> jhutchins_wk: Which is irrelevant when being unable to ven log in on a TTY.
[17:34] <jhutchins_wk> troop: The fastest way to recover at this point would probably be to reinstall.
[17:34] <troop> reinstall ubuntu ?
[17:34] <bhavesh> I always get http://i.imgur.com/c4eDq.png  when I start empathy, any solution?
[17:34] <kylescottmcgill> bekks: it might have updated the alternatives and is trying to use one of those when he logins in via console, maybe... idk
[17:34] <jhutchins_wk> troop: Since you don't have any investment of time on the current setup, yes.
[17:34] <kylescottmcgill> oone of those fonts
[17:35] <jhutchins_wk> It could have broken the default font.
[17:35] <troop> Tahoma?
[17:35] <Zaki-Sama> Can i ask you something about the "Ubuntu for MOBILE" or should i go to a specific room ?
[17:35] <bekks> kylescottmcgill: On a regular tty, there are no different fonts, especially not ttf fonts like the ones that where installed.
[17:35] <jhutchins_wk> troop: That's why I suggest looking a the log files.
[17:35] <xangua> !phone | Zaki-Sama

[17:35] <jhutchins_wk> bekks: Don't be too sure of that.
[17:35] <troop> a lot of log files here
[17:35] <bhavesh> I also checked "remember this choice for future connections" but still I get same thing
[17:35] <bekks> jhutchins_wk: I am 1000% sure about that.
[17:36] <troop> boot.log bootstrap.log dpkg.log kern.log fontconfig.log etc....
[17:36] <jhutchins_wk> bekks: framebuffer.
[17:36] <troop> i will install again :D

[17:48] <mariorgrossi> There is a version of aptana studio 3 for ubuntu?
[17:48] <myhe> but when i try to install it again it says its installed
[17:48] <myhe> also i did not get any errors when changing grub
[17:49] <myhe> and toolstack
[17:49] <DarkPrince946> You sure that nx server isn't the right thing?
[17:49] <MonkeyDust> myhe  why do you need xen, if you're a beginner?
[17:50] <myhe> want to learn it
[17:50] <linocisco> what is the best opensource software like AutoCAD?
[17:50] <kylescottmcgill> DarkPrince946: if this is a VPS, then it wont have Xorg installed, VPS normally have ssh access not RDP, this is an assumption, but installing a GUI on to a VPS isnt going to work right off the bat
[17:50] <ikonia> learn it when you have experience
[17:50] <Ronalds_M> hi, I have old PC 2,2 GHz AMD Athlon and I tried using lubuntu on it, but flash clearly doesn't works, is there any way to make linux usable on it?
=== sourcode2 is now known as sourcode
[17:50] <linocisco> I would like to use it on Windows like QGIS which is powerful , opensource and can be installed on windows
[17:50] <myhe> sigh if you dont want to help please dont talk thank you
[17:50] <jhutchins_wk> bekks: Anyway, it looks like it's moot, but it is possible to screw up a non-fb console by messing with the system fonts.
[17:50] <myhe> i jsut need help with installing it and running thats all
[17:51] <kylescottmcgill> DarkPrince946: could you RDP on to your server before installing this application?
[17:51] <myhe> just*
[17:51] <greyduck> hello everyone
=== sourcode is now known as Guest82948
[17:51] <ikonia> myhe: so basically you need help with all of it then
[17:51] <myhe> no
[17:51] <DarkPrince946> I could.
[17:51] <myhe> its first time i have problem installing xen in linux
[17:51] <ikonia> myhe: installing it and running it is %99 of xen
[17:51] <devlos> Ronalds_M,  xubuntu works on more of my old machines than lubuntu.
[17:51] <myhe> on fedora its painless
[17:51] <BluesKaj> Ronalds_M, install ubuntu-restricted-extras
[17:51] <myhe> but i want it in ubuntu
[17:51] <kylescottmcgill> DarkPrince946: what is the software you tried to install?
[17:51] <jhutchins_wk> bekks: Also, I have seen installations where the consoles DO default to framebuffer, with screens byond 40x80 and often graphical overlay.  If you don't see the boot messages, chances are this is the case.
[17:52] <DarkPrince946> nomachine
[17:52] <ikonia> myhe: so what's the problem ?
[17:52] <myhe> that it seems that its not running
[17:52] <Ronalds_M> I tried installing all kind of extras, it doesn't works, right now I have gnash but it's so slow
[17:52] <myhe> even if i did go with how to
[17:52] <ikonia> myhe: that's not really a good description
[17:52] <myhe> i did write what problem it is some time ago but wait ill do it again
[17:53] <Ronalds_M> my old PC has 700 mb of RAM, and nvidia 128 mb old one
[17:53] <myhe> so i did try to install xen on ubuntu from this site https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen should be easy peasy but something is wrong
[17:53] <myhe> i did install hypervisor
[17:53] <jhutchins_wk> Ronalds_M: Um, I don't understand how flash not working (normal) is a problem with the OS.\
[17:53] <myhe> i did change grub etc
[17:53] <myhe> rebooted pc
=== Bladerunner is now known as Bladerunn
[17:53] <linocisco> what is the powerful opensource alternative to AutoCAD software?
[17:53] <myhe> then when i check if it works it says ERROR:  Can't find hypervisor information in sysfs!
[17:54] <myhe> that the problem
[17:54] <ikonia> so it's not booted the xen kernel then
[17:54] <ikonia> and the hypervisor isn't running
[17:54] <myhe> any idea how to fix that then?
[17:54] <ikonia> well, look at the kernel and look at the xen process list and see what's missing
[17:54] <jhutchins_wk> Ronalds_M: Whether gnash works depends mostly on what flash you're trying to display, most of what's on the 'net won't work.
[17:54] <kylescottmcgill> DarkPrince946: was there a guide you followed? that looks a little out of the box, i have never done anything like that, but basically your error messages are saying i cant start (respectively
[17:54] <myhe> i did figure that out thats why i did ask if the command on that site are correct for grub
[17:54] <daniel_> do i need to format my hard drive before setting up my server with it
[17:54] <jhutchins_wk> Ronalds_M: Did you try flash from adobe?
[17:54] <Ronalds_M> I have CD/RW disk, when I putted lubuntu on it, and tried to install, it took down windows xp in partitioning, so I installed Ubuntu, installed lubuntu packages and removed Ubuntu stuff
[17:54] <BluesKaj> Ronalds_M, ubuntu-restricted-extras isn't all kinds of extras , it contains what you need to play flash content
[17:55] <ikonia> myhe: sorry what ?
[17:55] <DarkPrince946> Not really, I just install the .deb's
[17:55] <Ronalds_M> so my linux is a mess now
[17:55] <BluesKaj> just install ir Ronalds_M
[17:55] <BluesKaj> it
[17:56] <myhe> in other way is this correct? sudo sed -i 's/GRUB_DEFAULT=.*\+/GRUB_DEFAULT="Xen 4.1-amd64"/' /etc/default/grub and sudo sed -i 's/TOOLSTACK=.*\+/TOOLSTACK="xm"/' /etc/default/xen
[17:56] <Ronalds_M> I installed restricted extras
[17:56] <Ronalds_M> nothing happens
[17:56] <Ronalds_M> flash doesn't work even on chrome
[17:56] <Ronalds_M> or chromiom
[17:56] <kylescottmcgill> DarkPrince946: follow this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NomachineNX
[17:56] <Ozzy> anybody knows how to deploy a qt creator project with a Ubuntu QML toolkit?

[17:58] <maksim> hi, can someone help me with sound issue? I have Linux Mint 14 Mate for about a month or so and today sound started to glitch. I can't play mp3 file with Banshee, GnomeMPlayer, Rhytmbox and Audacity. it sounds like this 'h-h-h-h-h-h-e-e-e-e-e-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-o-o-o-o-o'. it repeats small sound chunks several times and moves on. I've tried 'pulseaudio -k' but without any luck. 'mv .pulse pulse_old' helped in some way, now sound works ok, but only for Banshee,
[17:58] <maksim>  GnomeMPlayer and Rhytmbox. but not for Audacity, the thing is I need especially Audacity. can anyone help me with this?
[17:59] <Ronalds_M> installing linux with cd/rw is alright?
[17:59] <lhavelund> !mint | maksim
[17:59] <ubottu> maksim: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[17:59] <troop> which nvidia driver do you recommend ?
[18:00] <lhavelund> maksim: they wlil be a lot more knowledable about the in-depth workings of mint.
[18:00] <maksim> I know this is ubuntu channel, but on linuxmint-help channel there is no support for this issue, as far as on #alsa and #pulseaudio
[18:00] <DarkPrince946> Still no worky.
[18:00] <jhutchins_wk> Rondom: That's how it's usually done.
[18:00] <SnowmanX11> alienaut: just type to the command line: 'top' and you will get a monitoring tool, which shows the usage of memory/processor and monitoring online. Push CTRL+C to abort
[18:00] <Ubiquity> i'm trying to setup a static ip address, but I don't know what my "address netmask network broadcast gateway" values should be in /etc/network/interfaces
[18:00] <jhutchins_wk> Rondom: N'mind, missing nic.
[18:00] <troop> restarting
[18:00] <alienaut> SnowmanX11, thanks!
[18:00] <lhavelund> maksim: Those are the only three channels I could suggest being helpful, I'm afraid. If #linuxmint-help isn't helpful, and the upstream channels (#alsa, #pulseaudio) aren't useful either, you seem to be on your own. :(
[18:01] <Ubiquity> how can I find out what my "address netmask network broadcast gateway " values should be
[18:01] <greyduck> hi
[18:01] <ikonia> Ubiquity: ask your network administrator
[18:01] <Ubiquity> for configuring a static ip
[18:01] <SnowmanX11> alienaut: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lucid/man1/top.1.html
[18:01] <SnowmanX11> alienaut: your welcome
[18:02] <Ubiquity> ikonia: i am the network administrator. I'm jumping in head first and configuring my first server. This is the second to last hurdle
[18:02] <jhutchins_wk> Ubiquity: Do you have a working windows system?
[18:02] <Ubiquity> am on it right now
[18:02] <ikonia> Ubiquity: if you are the network administraot, you should know what your gateway device is, and what you network address ranges are
[18:02] <ikonia> Ubiquity: this is a basic requirement of running a network
[18:03] <devlos> Ubiquity,  try route -n
[18:03] <jhutchins_wk> Ubiquity: ipconfig /all should show you most of the required settings.  If you are behind a router that is doing DHCP you should be able to just tell the linux system "use dhcp".
[18:03] <jhutchins_wk> Ubiquity: If you're getting your current config from your ISP that should work as well.
[18:03] <devlos> route -n will show gateway
[18:04] <DarkPrince946> Same error
=== Bladerunner is now known as Bladerunn
[18:04] <Ubiquity> jhutchins_wk: see, i don't want to use dhcp for this server if i can help it. I'm trying to run WOL and I've configured it to run remotely
[18:04] <jhutchins_wk> DarkPrince946: As what?
[18:04] <alienaut> compiz is using %4.6 of memory is that normal?
[18:04] <compdoc> maksim, that happened to me and it turned out a usb device was causing it. But other hardware issues can cause it too. You have many usb devices, or have you added any devices to your system recently?
[18:04] <Ubiquity> jhutchins_wk: thank you for the ipconfig help
[18:04] <jhutchins_wk> Ubiquity: How are addresses on your network assigned now?  By a router?
[18:04] <DarkPrince946> jhutchins_wk: http://pastebin.com/DGaxL0kE
[18:05] <jhutchins_wk> Ubiquity: It's usually a good idea for routers to be static, but you can also lock an addres to a MAC in dhcp.
[18:05] <compdoc>  maksim, btw, there is a bug in some kernel versions dealing with pulseaudio
[18:05] <maksim> I have only one usb device - mouse
[18:05] <Ubiquity> jhutchins_wk: addresses are assigned by dhcp
[18:06] <maksim> and there wasn't a problem with it for last 5 years :)
[18:06] <nemos> I need help. What bios settins need to be set in order to try the linux livecd? I tried both ubuntu and centos and i get a freeze at the login screen, the keyboard and mouse clicks doesnt work. The graphics dies or something.
[18:06] <greyduck> where's the best room for a noob?
[18:06] <Ubiquity> jhutchins_wk: i assume that's what you mean
[18:06] <Ubiquity> greyduck: a padded room far far away from here. just kidding
[18:07] <Ubiquity> greyduck: have you looked at the documentation for whatever ails you?
[18:07] <greyduck> cheers!
[18:07] <jhutchins_wk> Ubiquity: So either set the dhcp server to assign a consistent address to that mac, or choose an unused address in the proper range, put it in a static config, and make sure you reserve that address on the dhcp server so it won't be assigned.
[18:07] <greyduck> duck fever
[18:07] <jhutchins_wk> greyduck: This one's not too bad.  Got a question?
[18:07] <MonkeyDust> greyduck  ask your question and see if someone can help
[18:08] <Ubiquity> jhutchins_wk: i think i'll set my dhcp server to assign a consistent address. That sounds like it will solve two problems
[18:11] <burdickjp> Is there a gnu units lens for unity?
[18:13] <jhutchins_wk> Ubiquity: Believe me, I remember how frustrating it was when documentation said "ask your network administrator".  No I am one for real.

[18:16] <Ubiquity> i'll have to do that one day
[18:17] <F3Speech> Anyone any ideas how to fix "CIFS VFS: Unexpected lookup error -112", happens after about 1-2 hours inactivity. Running server install 12.04 thinking it might be something to do with the servers power managment, just because it only happens after a large idle time?
[18:19] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: What's serving the cifs share?
[18:19] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: If it's server grade hardware, it's more likely an issue on the client, but I would guess network hardware somewhere in the link.
[18:21] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: buffalo nas is serving share
=== Bladerunner is now known as Bladerunn
[18:22] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: and server hardware is old q6600
[18:22] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: Any outstanding software/firmware updates?
[18:23] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: server is using a tp-link wifi usb adaptor
[18:23] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: nafaif
[18:23] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: wifi will do that.
[18:23] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: THere's no way you can completely eliminate that kind of error with that kind of setup.
[18:23] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: why is it only after a long idle it happens?
[18:24] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: Traffic helps keep the links active.  They're more likely to drop when idle.
[18:24] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: i thought is might be acpi related, powersaving on the usb or something
[18:24] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: It's more the sensitivity of cifs to minor network errors.
[18:24] <F3Speech> jhut the server is processing all the time the network link should be idle that long tbh
[18:25] <F3Speech> shouldn't*
[18:25] <F3Speech> think i should maybe try with smb?
[18:25]  * SnowmanX11 is away: I'm busy.../Elfoglalt vagyok, ne zavarj!
[18:26] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: if the share _is_ idle periodically it's a good idea to set it up with autofs so that it brings up a new connection whenever it's needed.
[18:26] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: No significant difference.
[18:26] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: im still thinking its a power managment issue rather than protocol but atm i dont really 'know' anything :)
[18:26] <MonkeyDust> !away | SnowmanX11
[18:26] <ubottu> SnowmanX11: Please do not use noisy away messages and nicks in Ubuntu channels. It is annoying and unnecessary. Use the command "/away <reason>" to set your client away silently. See also «/msg ubottu Guidelines»
[18:26]  * SnowmanX11 is back (gone 00:00:39)
[18:26] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: If it were a power management issue, other connections would be affected.
[18:27] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: the whole server hangs, all the web services and python i have running lose network connection
[18:28] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: Ok, that's not what you origianlly reported.
=== Bladerunner is now known as Bladerunn
[18:29] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk:  sorry let me be clear, when i say hangs it is still responding to a degree as it reports errors to screen, but refuses any network connections
[18:29] <cornfeed> good morning...I am trying to acpid to work with  my toshiba and i am about at my wits end...I have tried everything....I have a toshiba portege r835-p81 (laptop). I have acpid running and I can use acpi_listen to see that is catching events like changing screen brightness, but it doesn't *actually* do anything. I looked into fnfxd which is custom tailored to toshiba laptops but I cant find anything about its implimentation. has anyone worked with
[18:29] <cornfeed>  toshiba laptops and acpid??
[18:29] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: dmesg or hald logs would be whre to look.
[18:29] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: I would still say hardware is the most likely issue.
[18:29] <cornfeed> F3Speech: try a boot flag of acpi=off
[18:29] <cornfeed> F3Speech: i had the same issues...drove me nuts for a month
[18:30] <F3Speech> cornfeed: i did read that few hours ago
[18:30] <F3Speech> cornfeed: tried it and my usb wifi wouldnt connect
[18:30] <cornfeed> damn
[18:31] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: What are the chances of getting an actual internal wifi card, or going to wired?
[18:31] <F3Speech> i want to find where the server sets stuff like blank screen and any idle conditions try turn them off
[18:32] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: none really... well actuall guess now its setup i could move it
[18:32] <cornfeed> F3Speech: hmmm you could try killing acpid
[18:33] <fego> hi all, any idea in which package i can find the "helvetica-medium" font?
[18:33] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: it has a internal card, i dont dont have the  cable available at my desk
[18:33] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: and i think my router is full, if i remember i think thats why i went wifi
[18:33] <F3Speech> jhut i guess i could give the server my lan cable and ill take the wifi lol
[18:34] <F3Speech> cornfeed: how would i do that
[18:34] <cornfeed> F3Speech: sudo service acpid stop (i think, i only use ubuntu in a few offices)
[18:34] <cornfeed> pretty sure though
[18:35] <cornfeed> then use "pidof acpid" to make sure
[18:35] <F3Speech> it seemed to stop ok

[18:40] <sonik> having problems disabling Ctrl to show mouse option, it's not in the "Mouse Settings" window on 12.10?
[18:40] <F3Speech> d1zzy : the package name is prob just zenity-common?
[18:40] <stercor> openssh-server and openssh-client are at newest versions at both ends
[18:41] <d1zzy> zenity-common works (it installs the amd64 version), but zenity-common:i386 doesn't (it's needed by zenity:i386 which is needed by the steam beta client)
[18:41] <MonkeyDust> stercor  then maybe it's blocked by iptables?
[18:41] <F3Speech> d1zzy: you have 64bit install?
[18:41] <d1zzy> yes
[18:41] <devlos> stector does the machine you are connecting to have them installes

[18:50] <stercor> milamber: OK. Where to from here.  I'm on 12.10 and it reports internal errors.  That recommends a restart.
[18:50] <stercor> milamber: Yes, the addresses are good.  I even tried the IP addresses.
[18:50] <F3Speech> d1zzy: yes, where is is... maybe one of the more experianced members can remember
[18:51] <milamber> stercor: we'll need more details then, from what i gather you are trying to scp from a netbook to a home server behind a residential/home router/firewall and getting the error 'no route to host'    what are the internal errors you are talking about?
[18:51] <Eagleman> Where do you suggest placing important key and crt files for for example openvpn and apache2 ssl, currently i have them in each applications /etc/ folder but since they are also backupped by rsnapshot and then copied to a windows disk in a rar file, the key and crt files are accessible, which is not so secure
[18:51] <stercor> milamber: unrelated...
[18:52] <F3Speech> d1zzy: http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/ here looks like a good start though
[18:53] <milamber> stercor: if you think you need to restart go ahead and do that
[18:53] <d1zzy> n
[18:53] <stercor> milamber: that seems heavy-handed, but it's the only option I see...
[18:54] <StormKing> hello all

[19:02] <ofcan> how can I view command line history from a certain date?
[19:03] <milamber> ofcan: not possible as far as i know, but all commands each user enters should be logged in their home directory in a "hidden" file .bash_history
[19:03] <Greg8823> Muphrid: a list of playback hardware devices
[19:04] <atlef> ofcan, have you set HISTTIMEFORMAT
[19:04] <Muphrid> Greg8823: do you have a different playback defaulted? like hdmi or s/pdif instead of analog?
[19:04] <atlef> if not i do not think it is possible

[19:07] <Greg8823> Muphrid: aplay does show a card 0. but it shows it twice and says one is analog (device 0) and digital (device 1)
[19:07] <devlos> great thanks yeats, thats what i was looking for>
[19:08] <Muphrid> Greg8823: which one is selected on sound settings? did sound work before and not anymore, or never worked?
[19:08] <Greg8823> Muphrid: no, it has never worked

[19:09] <DominikST95> hey folks, I have a strange bug in Skype...if I try to play sound through my speakers, it starts to cackle extremly...Any help(I guess it has something to do with pulseaudio)
[19:10] <Church> nicholas: imho it depends if you really have gnome classic or gnome fallback option
[19:10] <Greg8823> Muphrid: Digital is selected in sound settings and im using a pair of saitek GH30 headphones to test
[19:11] <Church> nicholas: as in in first case it might be somewhere in metacity options in control panel IIRC, in second .. maybe some gconf/dconf settings
[19:11] <nicholas> how do i find the difference. i did "apt-get install gnome-shell" and then gnome classic
[19:11] <Muphrid> Greg8823: you should select analog if you are connected to a headphone jack, digital is for hdmi or spdif

[19:12] <DominikST95> hi
[19:12] <aberrant> where can I find instructions on how to upgrade a server from 10.04 to 12.10?
=== help is now known as Guest68822
[19:12] <bekks> aberrant: You have to upgrade to 12.04 first, then to 12.10 - usually, on a server, you want to stay on LTS, aka 12.04
[19:12] <yeats> !upgrade | aberrant
[19:12] <ubottu> aberrant: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[19:12] <aberrant> gotcha. Thank you.
[19:13] <mrg_> ok  i have a slight issue at mo, i followed this guide https://launchpad.net/~makson96/+archive/fglrx and now my ubuntu loads to black screen (i have tried ctrl+shift+f1 to get console with no luck
[19:13] <kylescottmcgill> How do you install Ubuntu using the text based installer? According to Google, Ubuntu dropped support for the Alternate CD's for 12.10
[19:13] <Church> nicholas: try running gconf-editor, there key /apps/metacity/general/button_layout
[19:13] <Greg8823> Muphrid: i did and i tried both headphone jacks still neither works
[19:13] <aberrant> so I have to go 10.04 -> 11.04 -> 12.04 -> 12.10?
[19:13] <MonkeyDust> !text | kylescottmcgill
[19:13] <ubottu> kylescottmcgill: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[19:13] <mrg_> i tried root recovery terminal and to delete xconf ....but no file like that exists
[19:13] <Muphrid> Greg8823: what do you mean "both" jacks?
[19:13] <bekks> aberrant: No. 10.04 -> 12.04 as I said
[19:13] <Church> nicholas: eg. i have "close,minimize,maximize,menu:"
[19:13] <DominikST95> @aberrant You can upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04
[19:13] <kylescottmcgill> ty MonkeyDust
[19:14] <aberrant> ok. Hm.
[19:14] <Muphrid> there is only one
[19:14] <mrg_> im using the live cd from my phone at mo but it has maybe 30 mins battery left and is not charging
[19:14] <Church> nicholas: as in all of them on the left
[19:14] <mrg_> so how do i rescue my ubuntu isntall?
[19:14] <Greg8823> Muphrid: The tower has a front and a rear heaphone jacks
[19:14] <nicholas> Church: i haven't a metacity option
[19:14] <Muphrid> Greg8823: ah, true
[19:14] <aberrant> so it's just update-manager-core and then do-release-upgrade?
[19:14] <aberrant> that is, install update-manager-core?
[19:15] <mrg_> sorry for the urgency but im stuck at work and as i say time limited
[19:15] <nicholas> Church: i'm using compiz on gnome-classic
[19:16] <atlef> mrg_, it's called xorg.conf maybe
[19:16] <Church> oh, then don't know. i always disabled all effects.
[19:16] <d1zzy> F3Speech: weird, I solved everything by doing this: dpkg -i steam_latest.deb (errors), apt-get install -f (installs some :i386 packages), and again dpkg -i steam_latest.deb which succeeds
[19:16] <Church> nicholas: try googling
[19:16] <mrg_> atlef theres no xorg.conf file
[19:17] <F3Speech> d1zzy: glad u got sorted :)
[19:17] <atlef> mrg_, in /etc/X11 ?
[19:17] <nicholas> have done that but i maybe have to do some more
[19:17] <milamber> !nomodeset | mrg_
[19:17] <ubottu> mrg_: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[19:17] <Muphrid> Greg8823: do you have another headphone or sound device to test?
[19:18] <milamber> mrg_: the other option is hold right shift while grub is loading and boot the previous kernel
[19:18] <mrg_> ubottu the press e on the boot menu and replace quiet boot...tried that no luck
[19:18] <ubottu> mrg_: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[19:19] <Greg8823> Muphrid: yeah i have another pair of headphones and a bluetooth speaker that is paired
[19:19] <MonkeyDust> mrg_  ubottu is a (ro)bot
[19:19] <mrg_> milamber i tried in the extended options to load an earlier kernal same issue
[19:19] <mrg_> oh ok
[19:19] <Greg8823> Muphrid: but the speaker is not on
[19:19] <Muphrid> Greg8823: so, they work?
[19:19] <milamber> mrg_: have you tried the nomodeset option?
[19:19] <mrg_> yes
[19:20] <mrg_> the process that i used aparently took me down a version of xsession
[19:20] <kslater> sweet, just got my fingerprint reader working again.
[19:20] <mrg_> to make it compatable with the ati legacy drivers
[19:20] <d1zzy> F3Speech: heh, on the first rean the steam client updates itself (without root), seems to be storing the updated version in ~/.local/share/Steam
[19:20] <mrg_> thats proberly whats the problem but its trying to fix it
[19:20] <Greg8823> Muphrid: yeah im able to use them both with my phone and get sound, but when i try to use it with the computer i get nothing
[19:21] <Greg8823> Mophrid: even if i use the exact same sound
[19:21] <mrg_> eeek my phones at 10% battery i may of been optermistic when i said i have 30 minutes
[19:22] <mrg_> ok can i install this xsession thing onto ubuntu from this live cd?
[19:22] <mrg_> or uninstall the fglrx thingy from inside this session?
[19:22] <Muphrid> Greg8823: do you have all the modules listed in 'lsmod | grep snd_hda' ?
[19:22] <sgonyea> How do I get in touch with Ubuntu package maintainers?
[19:22] <milamber> mrg_: can you get into the session?
[19:22] <yeats> sgonyea: look the package up on packages.ubuntu.com and email them
[19:22] <mrg_> its on the same laptop im running this livecd from if that helps
[19:23] <milamber> mrg_: if so you should remove the package you installed with apt-get remove (and i would say use the purge option), remove the ppa, then do an update/upgrade
[19:23] <Greg8823> Mophrid: how would i know if i have all of them?
[19:23] <mrg_> how do i link into the installed session from the live cd?
[19:23] <milamber> mrg_: it would be easier if you could get access to the box itself (even if you could get in via ssh)
[19:23] <yeats> sgonyea: though if you're reporting a problem it's better to file a bug report than to contact a maintainer directly
[19:24] <mrg_> (i only started using ubuntu yesterday)
[19:24] <cuqa>  /join #css
[19:24] <Muphrid> Greg8823: now check this to see what module it is using: lspci -v | grep -A 5 Audio
[19:24] <milamber> mrg_: then i would just do a clean install, copy any files you need to a separate flash drive and then reinstall
[19:24] <Muphrid> Greg8823: I have hdmi, realtek and intel
[19:25] <mrg_> not an option the live cd is running from my phone
[19:25] <mrg_> 9% battery left now
[19:25] <Guest68822> please help NO_PUBKEY AB6DA34B475A6B7F
[19:25] <sgonyea> yeats: The last bug on this package is over 9 months old and unanswered.  Probably better if I wake someone up
[19:25] <milamber> mrg_: not sure what you mean by that, if you have a livecd there should be an option to install the os
[19:25] <sgonyea> (or try to)
[19:26] <mrg_> milamber there is but its not a cd its a phone being used as a pendrive
[19:26] <yeats> sgonyea: don't be suprised if their response is "file a bug report" ;-)
=== Guest68822 is now known as n3mu5
[19:26] <mrg_> the phone is not charging attached to this for some reason and its battery is going down
[19:26] <milamber> mrg_: so why do you think you won't be able to reinstall?
[19:26] <bekks> Guest68822: Thats not a real problem but just a warning. You can fix it like: sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com key-fingerprint
[19:26] <mrg_> not enough time
[19:26] <vlt> Hello. I want to add some kernel options to grub. Which file to edit on Ubuntu 12.04 with GRUB2?
[19:27] <mrg_> the battery will die before then
[19:27] <bekks> mrg_: Then you have a hardware problem which cannot be fixed by software.
[19:27] <n3mu5> thx bekks
[19:27] <milamber> mrg_: ah, and the computer isn't charging the phone battery?
[19:27] <atlef> milamber, because he is running the livecd from the sd card on his phone
[19:27] <mrg_> is there no way to link into the installed session from this live @cd@
[19:27] <Ubiquity> hi all, i'm trying to enable wake on lan. I need some troubleshooting
[19:27] <mrg_> and correct its not charging
[19:27] <Ubiquity> this thing is driving me crazy

[19:28] <ubottu> Ubiquity: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[19:28] <bekks> mrg_: You cannot fix a broken cable (e.g.) with some software.
[19:28] <atlef> Ubiquity, is it enabled in the bios
[19:28] <Greg8823> mophrid: I have Intel, codec_Realtek, i dont have hdmi. also it said i have NVIDIA Corporation MCP61 high Definition audio (rev 2a) with the kernel driver in use being  snd_hda_intel
[19:28] <Ubiquity> aflef: i have enabled it in the bios. I have enabled it in ethtool
[19:28] <mrg_> bekks the ati card worked fine before i added the propertry drivers (fine but slow)
=== callie is now known as Celene_away
[19:29] <mrg_> the hardware is fine its the drivers that are the issue
[19:29] <bekks> mrg_: Which has nothing to do with your phone not being charged.
[19:29] <mrg_> i did this https://launchpad.net/~makson96/+archive/fglrx
[19:29] <milamber> mrg_: what i am trying to tell you is that you need to gain access to the machine
[19:29] <mrg_> bekks i know, the phone not charging is merely adding time limit to me
[19:30] <milamber> mrg_: is the computer you borked a laptop or a desktop?
[19:30] <mrg_> im on the machine just as a live cd not as the installed version if that makes sense
[19:30] <Ubiquity> i'm looking at my router right now and i'm seeing a packet go to the wired connection of the box i want to turn on
[19:30] <mrg_> a laptop
[19:30] <rblst> hi folks, trying to get a Samsung SCX-3400F to scan (USB Id: 0x04E8 0x344F) under Ubuntu 12.10 64.bit; anyone has any experience with that?
[19:30] <mrg_> i have full access to it as im on it now but as a live cd
[19:30] <mrg_> the live cd is however installed on my phones memory card
[19:30] <mrg_> when the phone battery dies BLAM no acccess to the live cd
[19:31] <mrg_> hence my urgency
[19:31] <greyduck> Could anyone tell me how i might change the hostname in ubuntu 12.10 please
[19:31] <bekks> greyduck: Just user the command "hostname".
[19:31] <milamber> mrg_: do you have ssh-server installed on the laptop? and i think you should be trying to gain access to the console on the machine, not from the live cd
[19:31] <blackline> llutz, do you feel up for giving mounting my Popcorn Hour as a folder another try? :D
[19:32] <greyduck> i tried sudo gedit /etc/hostnam with noluck
[19:32] <mrg_> milamber its the same machine
[19:32] <bekks> greyduck: Use the command "hostname".
[19:32] <mrg_> the laptop im on is the one im trying to fix
=== peer is now known as Guest19654
[19:32] <bekks> greyduck: "sudo hostname mynewhostname"
[19:32] <greyduck> ok i'll try and thanks
[19:32] <mrg_> live cd works installed version does not
[19:33] <mrg_> is there a way to manualy reset the graphics drivers in the files?
[19:33] <mrg_> i have access to the installed versions /etc/X11/
[19:34] <mrg_> if i delete the contents will that force it to install default drivers?
[19:34] <milamber> mrg_: what i am telling you is that it is going to be easier to gain access to the laptop than try and fix this from a livecd. you installed a package that you don't know what files it affects. you should remove it with the package manager.
[19:35] <mrg_> but i cant get into the installed version of ubuntu
[19:35] <mrg_> the best i can do is the recovery and then root console
[19:35] <mrg_> but that wouldnt let me uninstall stuff
[19:36] <mrg_> low graphics mode wouldnt load either
[19:36] <mrg_> nomodeset no worked
[19:36] <Greg8823> mophrid: I have codec, Intel, codec_Realtek, i dont have hdmi. also it said i have NVIDIA Corporation MCP61 high Definition audio (rev 2a) with the kernel driver in use being  snd_hda_intel
[19:36] <mrg_> shift+ctrl+f1 wouldnt work on the black screen
[19:37] <mrg_> i was ok untill i tried to fix my slow graphics using a guide then it all went to pot
[19:37] <mrg_> is there a rollback service like with windows?
[19:37] <rblst> greyduck: hostname changes it for the current session, /etc/hostname changes it permanently, but you need a reboot for that, i believe
[19:38] <MonkeyDust> mrg_  you mean a downgrade, best not do it
[19:38] <mrg_> if i cant get this to work im looking at 5 and a half hours of nothing but a black screen
[19:39] <mrg_> so deleting the x11 folder wont force ubuntu to reinstall another copy
[19:39] <mrg_> what about copying the x11 folder from the livecd to the installed hd?
=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[19:40] <mrg_> it wont let me?

[19:41] <Greg8823> Muphrid: thanks for your help but i have to go. i will try again some other time.
[19:41] <mrg_> ok aparently the installed x11 folder is owned by root not me could that be the issue?
[19:42] <mrg_> guys?
[19:42] <bekks> mrg_: Everything in /etc/ is not owned by your user.
[19:43] <mrg_> is there a way to replace the /etc/x11 with that of the live cd?
[19:43] <mrg_> from what i can see that is where the graphics are controlled
=== will is now known as Guest80915
[19:43] <MonkeyDust> mrg_  for anything outside /home, you need sudo
[19:43] <mrg_> ah so i can do it in terminal
[19:44] <yeats> mrg_: if I were you I would use a live CD/USB (not your dying phone) to back up your relevant files and reinstall
[19:45] <yeats> mrg_: I think you're in over your head and that would be better than all this urgency stuff

[19:47] <yeats> mrg_: probably not wise to judge the whole project from this one bad experience, but to each one's own
[19:48] <mrg_> all i did was try to install proper video drivers
[19:48] <mrg_> and the whole thing stopped working...its more then a bad experience
[19:48] <yeats> mrg_: I would advise purchasing an in-support video card

[19:51] <d1zzy> F3Speech: cool, just played some Amnesia The Dark Descent on Linux from Steam :)
[19:51] <mrg_> if i unplug it then it will crash what im doing but ill try when it fails
[19:51] <madmax_x> #thepiratebay.org
[19:52] <mrg_> it seems to be reinstalling faster
[19:52] <atlef> mrg_, ok, it is just that i have experienced that certain usb ports on laptop does not deliver enogh power to charge
[19:52] <yeats> myersg: click on the volume icon and click Sound Settings
[19:52] <mrg_> which is good as im on 3% battery
[19:52] <myersg> Yeats
[19:52] <myersg> I did
[19:52] <yeats> myersg: then make sure it's using that device
[19:52] <mrg_> atlef you may be onto something i admit im hoping its that
[19:52] <myersg> it is and nothing
[19:53] <mrg_> i was told to use ubuntu as its gui is light wieght etc but so far its been really slugish
[19:53] <yeats> myersg: what do you mean by "nothing"? it's not showing as an available device?
[19:53] <myersg> it is
[19:53] <myersg> but no sound
[19:53] <mrg_> hence the trying to install the proper drivers for my amd
[19:53] <myersg> and no imput form the mic]
[19:53] <mrg_> ati even
[19:53] <yeats> mrg_: with an out of support ATI card, that would be expected
[19:54] <__Alex_> mrg_: Someone was seriously lying to you, Ubuntu has the most bloated GUI of all Live-CD based linux distros I know
[19:54] <mrg_> :(
[19:54] <mrg_> thats what the guide i used was spose to fix
[19:54] <mrg_> instead it killed my os
[19:54] <mrg_> alex i was on windows 8
[19:54] <mrg_> :(
[19:54] <ThomasCorwin> mrg_ : Does it work at all?
[19:54] <yeats> mrg_: with all those sorts of unofficial guides, your mileage may vary
[19:55] <mrg_> all i wanted to do was get better performance from minecraft lol
[19:55] <yeats> mrg_: especially if you're not that familiar with Ubuntu/Linux in the first place
[19:55] <myersg> so any help?
[19:55] <mrg_> im flashing on 1% battery till not done installing
[19:55] <atlef> mrg_, is this a machine that came with win8?

[19:56] <mrg_> but i have win 8 at home
[19:56] <cuqa> with 1% you cant come far enough :p
[19:56] <mrg_> its an old laptop
[19:56] <yeats> myersg: you've done the "test sound" feature?
[19:56] <Sliker> myersg: all i can suggest is go inro alsamixer and unmute evrything. see if one gets sound on them
[19:56] <myersg> yes and no sound comes out
[19:56] <mrg_> it has a radion hd 4000 serise gfx card though

[19:57] <debian-no0b__> I just installed `stud` (https://github.com/bumptech/stud) and it includes this `debian` folder. I don't really know much about debian, wondering if someone knows how I can add stud to `init.d` using these scripts.
[19:58] <atlef> mrg_, look at this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/203232/radeon-hd-2000-3000-4000-on-12-10-quantal-fglrx-legacy-12-6-unsupported-wh
[19:59] <yeats> debian-no0b__: are you running Ubuntu?
[19:59] <yeats> debian-no0b__: I ask because I see that you are also asking in #debian
[19:59] <mrg_> atlef thats exactly my issue
[19:59] <atlef> mrg_, oh hehe
[19:59] <mrg_> and what happened to me
[19:59] <mrg_> i  think
[20:00] <debian-no0b__> yeats: yes
[20:00] <debian-no0b__> ubuntu
[20:00] <debian-no0b__> isnt ubuntu debian based?
[20:00] <mrg_> come on! downloading language packs what the hell!!!!
[20:00] <atlef> yes
[20:01] <yeats> debian-no0b__: yes, but they are very different projects and only ubuntu is supported here
[20:01] <mrg_> oh ....umm
[20:01] <mrg_> my phone is dead but im still here
[20:01] <mrg_> O.o
[20:01] <atlef> mrg_, magic
[20:02] <mrg_> but its the phones mmc im using for the live cd
[20:02] <mrg_> this ...shouldnt...be
[20:02] <debian-no0b__> yeats: do you have any tips?
[20:02] <atlef> mrg_, but it seems you need to install 12.04 ie. downgrade
[20:02] <mrg_> ok gift horse + mouth ...i aint looking
[20:02] <yeats> mrg_: live CD is running in RAM - installation will probably not work
[20:02] <mrg_> how do you downgrade from 12.10?
[20:03] <yeats> mrg_: there's no such thing as an actual downgrade
[20:03] <myersg> can someone point me to the linux mint IRC?
[20:03] <yeats> mrg_: you would install 12.04
[20:03] <atlef> mrg_, you need the 12.04 iso
[20:03] <yeats> myersg: you're on mint?
[20:03] <DJones> !mint | myersg
[20:03] <ubottu> myersg: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[20:03] <mrg_> ah crud
[20:03] <myersg> I am running both
[20:04] <yeats> debian-no0b__: those are debian packaging scripts
[20:04] <mrg_> though the install seems to be still working
[20:04] <yeats> mrg_: it may continue to work until it needs to read the "live CD" you had running on your phone
[20:04] <mrg_> if i can use it tonight even with just a browser ill be happy
[20:05] <mrg_> im wondering if the mmc needs power from the phone to read or if its just using the usb5 volts
[20:05] <mrg_> could explain why the phone wasnt charging
[20:05] <NuSuey> well.. I got this issue.. If I do TOO MUCH stuff on my Ubuntu (sometimes) it start freezing ( I hear the HDD, and the PC behaves like it got 100% CPU usage, mouse is unmovable..etc). Could this be because I have removed the swap partition, or what the hell could be the issue?
[20:05] <debian-no0b__> yeats: thank you
[20:06] <debian-no0b__> im guessing that translates to `cant be used`
[20:06] <mrg_> i got to go do a patrol with luck ill still be here when i get back
[20:06] <debian-no0b__> even though i do have a dpkg command

[20:07] <Sliker> that happens when you run out of RAM space, NuSuey. You need a swap partition if that's the case.

[20:13] <ThomasCorwin> atlef: oh. whoops.

[20:21] <mrg_> but gnome to me is a garden ornimant
[20:21] <ThomasCorwin> mrg_: if you were planning on downgrading to 12.04, you couldve ran the LiveCD, then opened Firefox,  Then downloaded the 12.04 ISO Image to a flash drive, then lastly unpack the ISO onto a CD.
[20:22] <mrg_> thomas i may try that when i get home
[20:22] <mrg_> or go back to windows

[20:28] <mrg_> i thought when i installed ubuntu yesterday if it ever fails i`ll know i have it on my phone
[20:28] <bekks> riderplus: Maybe because you dont have permissions to save something in the path where you want to save it.
[20:28] <riderplus> I tried on all paths...same error message

[20:31] <mrg_> its that ...is it in ram or is the mmc getting enough power to be used lol
[20:31] <jamin> blargg, during initial boot you need to press a key during the splash screen with a circle and keyboard the bottom... then you should get a menu that will allow you to select memtest
[20:31] <ThomasCorwin> manners13: you should reinstall the package by putting sudo apt-get install bacula-sd     Then, uninstall the package with the basic removal code line: sudo apt-get remove bacula-sd

[20:53] <k1l> jamin: lts desktop becomes 5 sears support. if the user wants it he can have it. like you can read the user here doesnt want to have the newest software
[20:53] <anli_> So the reason synaptic is not working is because I want to keep my system? :)
[20:53] <anli_> It would be nice if I could still upgrade, it was possible before that date
[20:54] <anli_> Why isnt it possible any longer?
[20:54] <k1l> anli_: did you read what the bot told you?
[20:54] <yeats> anli_: read the link k1l shared
[20:54] <jamin> k1l, that's fine in theory... and yes, the LTS does get supported that long... however, then there's reality... the world around us moves too fast for a 5 year old desktop
[20:55] <Owiec> is it possible to install ubuntu with chroot? copy data to paritation, chroot to this parition and install system? default instalator doesnt work for me.
[20:55] <mrg_> damn it i need to use my phone soon
[20:55] <Owiec> *parition
[20:56] <mrg_> ok im gonna risk moving the usb ..wish luck
=== alex__ is now known as FaptainAwesome
[20:56] <Alabaster_W> so I removed my (eth0) nic and now i'm using my onboard (eth1) card. Attempting to restart networking  fails to bring up eth1
[20:56] <yeats> !install | Owiec
[20:56] <ubottu> Owiec: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall - Don't want to use a CD? See http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
[20:56] <Alabaster_W> ifup doens't bring up eth1 either
[20:57] <anli_> I like the link k1l shared, it told me which date the support ended, it did not tell why however
[20:57] <jamin> Alabaster_W, does ifconfig see it "ifconfig -a"?
[20:58] <vianna_> Boa tarde pessoal
[20:58] <k1l> anli_: read the message again. you missed half the part
[20:58] <anli_> k1l: Sorry then
[21:01] <Alabaster_W> jamin: yes, eth1 is seen on ifconfig -a
[21:01] <anli_> k1l: Which message btw?
[21:01] <jamin> Alabaster_W, and what about "sudo dhclient eth1"?
[21:01] <yeats> !eolupgrade | anli_ - once again:
[21:01] <ubottu> anli_ - once again:: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[21:02] <k1l> anli_: *sigh* its not gonna work if you wont concentrate on what you are doing and what people say in here to you.
[21:03] <anli_> I must be stupid, you give me two links, and I dont find the information you tell me is in there
[21:03] <aberrant> how do I update my repo list so I can upgrade from 10.04 to 12.04? My hosting company is using their own internal ones that don't have precise on them.
[21:04] <IdleOne> anli_: Why did the Ford motor company stop providing parts for the Model T ?
[21:04] <Alabaster_W> jamin: it's processing, one moment
[21:04] <jsmith_> can someone provide me with a link to a idiots guide to using IRC?
[21:04] <Alabaster_W> jamin: probably more like 60+ moments
[21:04] <jamin> anli_, doesn't help when people are rude to you... in short... nothing can be supported indefinitely... a decision has to be made on when to end support...
[21:04] <sophusn> jsmith_, http://google.com
[21:05] <blargg> jamin, I'm not seeing the circle and keyboard before the livecd boots. It goes directly to the Ubuntu .... screen.
[21:05] <anli_> jamin: As I see it, files are removed to actively make support stop
[21:05] <jamin> blargg, tap a key during the boot process repeatedly (twice a second or so) see if that interrupts the process for you
[21:06] <BluesKaj> aberrant, upgrading by editing the sources.list is dangerous
[21:06] <jamin> anli_, no... updates just stop happening...
[21:06] <velko> !google > velko
[21:06] <ubottu> velko, please see my private message
[21:06] <jamin> at another point, they relocate the archive...
[21:06] <anli_> Instead of making it bigger, yeah
[21:07] <Alabaster_W> aberrant: honestly, I would just do a fresh install
[21:07] <dpurgert> blargg --  F2, F8, del, or F12 (depending on BIOS) will get you to your boot menu...
[21:07] <anli_> IdleOne: I dont know
[21:07] <jamin> dpurgert, he's looking for the menu from the LiveCD
[21:08] <dpurgert> missed that bit -- thought he wasn't able to boot from the live CD (i.e. boot from hdd was first)
[21:08] <iuntyrz> how to

[21:09] <iuntyrz> on top left
[21:09] <iuntyrz> with unity
[21:09] <Alabaster_W> jamin: sudo dhclient eth1 returned nothing
[21:09] <aberrant> Alabaster_W: I can't do a fresh install.
[21:09] <Alabaster_W> jamin: and it took awhile
[21:09] <jamin> no output of any kind?

[21:12] <stefan_> hi; i use ubuntu 12.10 and my sound does not work. I have tried everything in the troubleshooting guide, have followed various alsamixer tutorials, etc. but nothing has worked... i'm using the front sound port on a custom built 32bit comp
[21:12] <dpurgert> stefan -- what sound card is in the computer?  generic realtec or something?
[21:12] <stefan_> dpurgert: hda intel or cpimi or something
[21:13] <Fonsie> how do i simply uninstall lubuntu from my system, its duel booted with windows
[21:13] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: how did you install it?
[21:13] <Fonsie> booted from usb drive
[21:13] <dpurgert> have you tried the ports on the rear?
[21:13] <stefan_> dpurgert: no, but the comp is on a rack, so i can't really...
[21:13] <k1l> Fonsie: bootup a live-system and remove the partitions, boot the windows cd and repair the bootloader
[21:14] <dpurgert> bwah?
[21:14] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: then delete the Ubuntu partitions in WIndows, you will need to reinstate the Windows boot loader using your Windows CD (or if there is a method in Windows, do that)
[21:14] <blargg> jamin, if I hold shift, I get a "load boot graphics" prompt, and N gives me a boot: prompt. Any way to run memtest86 from that?
[21:14] <stefan_> dpurgert: i can't get to the back without removing the computer from the rack, which is a hassle
[21:14] <magik_> One question,  Do I need to chown the folder to the group that I want to have access to it as well as share it through nautilus.  Because I've gotten to where I enter the password and it says I still dont have permissions to access.
[21:14] <Fonsie> i dont have a windows boot cd, computer did not come with one
[21:14] <Alabaster_W> jamin: no output of any kind whatsoever
[21:14] <ikla_> ubuntu is so awesome
[21:14] <dpurgert> indeed -- but if it's just a "desktop", why even bother rackmounting it?
[21:15] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: I'd ask in ##windows to see if you can do it from within Windows somehow, then delete the Ubuntu partitions
[21:15] <stefan_> dpurgert: i like standing desks :)
[21:15] <Fonsie> alright, thank you
[21:15] <ActionParsnip> magik_: run:  sudo smbpasswd -a $USER        and you can use your username and the password you set to get access
[21:16] <dpurgert> stefan_: fair enough. Did the soundcard work previously?
[21:16] <jamin> Alabaster_W, could try it again with "-v" should enable verbose output
[21:16] <Alabaster_W> jamin: sure thing man
[21:16] <stefan_> dpurgert: before i installed ubuntu 12.10
[21:16] <cordyceps> I need to trim some audio files, what's the best 'Buntu tool for this?
[21:16] <jamin> Alabaster_W, also is ethtool installed on your box? (apt-cache policy ethtool)
[21:16] <jamin> if so, try "sudo ethtool eth1"
[21:17] <Alabaster_W> jamin: yes
[21:17] <magik_> Well I've tried that, I still can't get access and I was wondering if it's because I'm trying to share something from a different unix account.  Than the account I want to give the access.
[21:17] <dpurgert> Stefan_: OK, we'll assume for the moment it's on the PCI bus ... so try lspci to see if it's listed.
[21:18] <Alabaster_W> jamin: it's onmy other macine, what ouput would you like?
[21:18] <stefan_> dpurgert: 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801JI (ICH10 Family) HD Audio Controller
[21:18] <jamin> blargg, never seen that prompt... does tab get you anything?
[21:18] <ThomasCorwin> Could someone help me please? I installed the Lubuntu Desktop inside of my Ubuntu 12.04 installation using the following line in the terminal:     sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop    The installation works great and installed just how it should have, but now i want rid of it.   sudo apt-get remove lubuntu-desktop   doeas not delete all of the files installed. How do i get rid of them all?
[21:18] <jamin> Alabaster_W, just want to make sure that it's seeing the network cable (link)
[21:18] <stefan_> dpurgert: 07:02.0 Multimedia audio controller: C-Media Electronics Inc CM8738 (rev 10)
[21:18] <blargg> jamin, tab at boot doesn't bring up anything.
[21:19] <stefan_> those are the 2
[21:19] <jamin> blargg, at the prompt you got from holding shift
[21:19] <dpurgert> well, it sees it, and it's presumably got the drivers installed/running.  Do you see a speaker icon in the upper right?
[21:19] <blargg> jamin, will try when I try rebooting again (mirroring internal drive with that machine right now).
[21:19] <Alabaster_W> jamin: i get output to the effect of "DHCPDISCOVER on eth1 to 255.255.255.255 port 67 interval 3"
[21:19] <cordyceps> Need to trim a few seconds off some audio files. What's the best tool to do this?
[21:20] <stefan_> dpurgert: yes. I have used alsamixer and unmuted everything in both the hda intel and the cpi, and nothing has worked.
[21:20] <jamin> ThomasCorwin, AFAIK there's no "easy" way to remove all of it... you could check the logs for which packages were installed when you add lubuntu-desktop
[21:20] <Alabaster_W> jamin: and the "3" is changed every time
[21:20] <velko> cordyceps, have you tried audacity?
[21:21] <jamin> ThomasCorwin, should be in /var/log/apt/
[21:21] <ThomasCorwin> jamin: Where would i find the log file?
[21:21] <ActionParsnip> stefan_: what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && chmod +x ./alsa-info.sh && ./alsa-info.sh --upload
[21:21] <ThomasCorwin> jamin: okay. i will try.
[21:21] <jamin> Alabaster_W, looks like it's not getting a response to the DHCP request... next steps would be tcpdump on the client and/or DHCP server
[21:21] <ActionParsnip> ThomasCorwin: sudo apt-get --purge remove lxde openbox       should make the rest fail deps and be removed
[21:21] <cordyceps> velko: yes, just wondering what else is out there.
[21:22] <stefan_> dpurgert: Your ALSA information is located at http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=d36774257b1cc8fa4265e2b21aade235a5e750c2
[21:22] <velko> ThomasCorwin, aptitude is better than apt-get in this respect. you can use it as a drop in replacement for apt-get. the added bonus is that it remembers the automatically installed dependencies and removes them also
[21:23] <ActionParsnip> stefan_: do you have an onboard sound card and a PCI sound card?
[21:23] <Alabaster_W> jamin: how would I go about doing that?
[21:23] <Alabaster_W> i'll google it
[21:23] <ActionParsnip> velko: removing metapackages only removes the metapackage
[21:23] <ThomasCorwin> ActionParsnip and velko: I will use both of you suggestions.
[21:23] <stefan_> ActionParsnip: I believe so. Is there some way to check?
[21:24] <ActionParsnip> stefan_: physically looking at the back, if you see 2 sound cards, then it is the case
[21:24] <velko> ActionParsnip, oh. my mistake then...
[21:24] <stefan_> ActionParsnip: I have a sound card at the back
[21:24] <ActionParsnip> stefan_: only one?
[21:24] <stefan_> ActionParsnip: well I'm using one on the front, too -- there's a hole for it and a mic
[21:25] <stefan_> the one I'm interested in is the front one
[21:25] <ActionParsnip> stefan_: try:  killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*   wait 10 seconds and reboot
[21:25] <NuSuey> uhm.. "You have queued an operation to move the start sector of partition /dev/sda5.  Failure to boot is most likely to occur if you move the GNU/Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows system partition C:."
[21:25] <NuSuey> I cant do that?
[21:25] <NuSuey> (message from gparted)
[21:25] <stefan_> ActionParsnip: okay; rebooting...
[21:25] <ThomasCorwin> velko: It says that the command "aptitude" cannot be found
[21:26] <stefan_> dpurgert: rebooting; brb
[21:26] <Alabaster_W> jamin: actually, a quick google of the man page is overwhelming
[21:26] <ActionParsnip> ThomasCorwin: itsnot default installed. apt-get is used now as it handles multiarch better
[21:26] <zwirc> How to change owner of a folder
[21:26] <NuSuey> I would love to know .. if i'm able to boot after I would do that
[21:27] <velko> ThomasCorwin, you have to install aptitude first. but the automatic removal will work only if you have installed the package via aptitude and you remove it with the same tool
[21:27] <ActionParsnip> zwirc: look into chown
=== install is now known as Guest53523
=== Sm0kEz is now known as Sm0_kEz
[21:27] <ThomasCorwin> velko: How do i install it?
[21:27] <NuSuey> atlef: maybe you know ?
[21:27] <IdleOne> NuSuey: according to that warning, probably not.
[21:27] <velko> ThomasCorwin, ActionParsnip corrected me that lubuntu is a metapackage. and in this case even aptitude wont help you remove everything the easy way. so just follow his other advice
[21:28] <velko> ThomasCorwin, apt-get install aptitude
[21:28] <dpurgert> zwirc:chown user:group <folder>
[21:28] <ThomasCorwin> velko: okay, i will
[21:28] <jamin> Alabaster_W, "sudo tcpdump -i eth1 '(port 67 or port 68)'"
[21:28] <Alabaster_W> jamin: just straight "sudo tcpdump" returns '0 packets captured 0 packets received by filter 0 packets dropped by kernal"
[21:28] <jamin> that should get you any traffic for DHCP
[21:28] <atlef> NuSuey, sorry, been busy in a different channel
[21:28] <jamin> Alabaster_W, I think that command defaulted to eth0 not eth1
[21:29] <Maverick_Hunter> Hey guys, I need some help installing Ubuntu
[21:29] <Alabaster_W> jamin: no ipv4 address assigned
[21:29] <Maverick_Hunter> everytime I install via wubi or boot via liveCD my system freezes
[21:29] <NuSuey> atlef: ah, hey :) np :P well.. can you help with that?
[21:29] <Maverick_Hunter> like maybe 2 mintues after boot
[21:29] <stefan_> back; still doesn't work
[21:29] <NuSuey> atlef: i worry if i'll do that, I wont be able to boot :o
[21:29] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: what video chip do you use?
[21:30] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: why use Wubi?
[21:30] <toil> I've got 8 ip address's on my server. How would I go about changing the outgoing IP address to a selective one?
[21:30] <stefan_> http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=d36774257b1cc8fa4265e2b21aade235a5e750c2
[21:30] <toil> Inside a swhell script
[21:30] <toil> shell*
[21:30] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: I used wubi because LiveCD failed, I have an Nvidia 8600GT
[21:30] <Alabaster_W> Maverick_Hunter: can you be more descriptive?
[21:31] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: add the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1
[21:31] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: okay, how do I add that and what does it do?
[21:31] <jamin> Alabaster_W, not sure... thought you could tcpdump an interface that didn't have an IP assigned to it
[21:31] <NuSuey> atlef: guess you're still busy :)
[21:31] <jamin> Alabaster_W, this may also be of help: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-unix-dhcpdump-monitor-dhcp-traffic/
[21:32] <Alabaster_W> jamin: you can, it's just not doing anything
[21:32] <atlef> NuSuey, yes, sorry
[21:32] <NuSuey> atlef: too bad :/ it will suck, if i'll be stuck without boot
[21:32] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: some nvidia gpus don't like nouveau so you blacklist it so it never loads, you can then install the proprietary driver
[21:32] <ActionParsnip> !bootoptions | Maverick_Hunter
[21:32] <ubottu> Maverick_Hunter: For a list and explanation on some of the boot options, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions See also !nomodeset.
[21:32] <ThomasCorwin> ActionParsnip: It worked. Thank you.
[21:32] <gool_> hi
[21:33] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: it will be what is causing the issue with the live CD and you can use a real install instead of nasty Wubi
[21:33] <toil> er
[21:33] <toil> nvm!
[21:33] <atlef> NuSuey, what are you trying to do?
[21:33] <gool_> can anyone explain to me
[21:33] <gool_> how to get skype on the newest make of ubuntu?
[21:33] <stefan_> dpurget: help?
[21:33] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: Thanks so much!
[21:33] <Alabaster_W> sudo apt-get install skype
[21:34] <dpurgert> stefan_: reboot didn't help?
[21:34] <Alabaster_W> gool_: sudo apt-get install skype
[21:34] <stefan_> dpurgert: no
[21:34] <ActionParsnip> gool_: I grab the deb file from skype's website
[21:34] <NuSuey> atlef: resizing the extende partition and then moving the linux partition to "grab the space"
[21:34] <dpurgert> stefan_: do you have pulseaudio installed?
[21:34] <gool_> it says the following packages have unmet dependencies
[21:34] <gool_> which is why i cant dl it
[21:34] <Alabaster_W> gool_: or you can go to the ubuntu software center and search for it in the search box
[21:34] <stefan_> dpurgert: yes
[21:34] <gool_> ala
[21:34] <gool_> it has to do with "dependencies"
[21:34] <gool_> which im unsure how to fix
[21:35] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: Do I want to change the boot option permanently or temprorarily?
[21:35] <atlef> NuSuey, someone suggested that if you have win installed, you should maybe do the shrinking in win to avoid conflicts
[21:35] <dpurgert> it's been a while since I've messed around with it, so forgive me missing something ... but IIRC, I had to get something playing, and then use the tool in pulse to "force" it to one sound card or the other (speakers or headset)
[21:35] <NuSuey> atlef: with gparted (and getting the message.. You have queued an operation to move the start sector of partition /dev/sda5.  Failure to boot is most likely to occur if you move the GNU/Linux partition containing /boot, or if you move the Windows system partition C:.
[21:35] <NuSuey> You can learn how to repair the boot configuration in the GParted FAQ.
[21:35] <NuSuey> http://gparted.org/faq.php
[21:36] <NuSuey> atlef: well i booted via the livecd..so I'm able to do so
[21:36] <atlef> NuSuey, do you have only one disk in your system
[21:36] <NuSuey> atlef: 4 :D
[21:36] <NuSuey> atlef: ubuntu, mac os, w7 & winXP
[21:36] <magik_> nice
[21:36] <gool_> why?
[21:36] <gool_> lol
[21:36] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: just for now, you can then install the proprietary driver and be ok
[21:36] <atlef> NuSuey, oh, that might be too complicated for me right now
[21:37] <atlef> NuSuey, sorry
[21:37] <NuSuey> atlef: well maybe I should try it and see what will it do? :o lol
[21:37] <NuSuey> atlef: but I may not boot of course :(
[21:37] <dpurgert> gool_ : sudo apt-get build-dep skype should fix it
[21:37] <ActionParsnip> gool_: run:  sudo apt-get -f install     and they will be satisfied. If you run 64bit OS then you will pull in a LOT of 32bit packages as deps
[21:38] <atlef> NuSuey, as long as you have all the cd/dvds at hand you should be able to fix it if it fails
[21:38] <gool_> trying dpurgert 's first
[21:38] <atlef> me thinks
[21:38] <gool_> looks to be installing
[21:38] <gool_> if not, i'll do your command actionparsnip
[21:38] <gool_> thanks much
[21:38] <NuSuey> atlef: okay, maybe i'll do it some other way.. i'll just grab the space.. create a new partition and mount and use the partition..
[21:39] <NuSuey> atlef: this way nothing should be f.cked up
[21:39] <dpurgert> ActioParsnip and my solution should end up doing the same thing (though his would have actually installed skype as part of the process)

[21:42] <deadmund> What is some good file recovery software that I can use on a failing (external) harddrive?
[21:42] <Gnea> deadmund: testdisk and foremost
[21:43] <Guest74176> testdisk
[21:43] <anders2_> ok, I just installed Ubuntu on my Nexus 7 device, but I am stuck in a initramfs shell
[21:43] <velko> deadmund, i have good experience with photorec
[21:43] <deadmund> Gnea: thanks
[21:43] <deadmund> velko: thanks
[21:43] <deadmund> no love for ddrescue?
[21:43] <Gnea> foremost will do what photorec can do, plus it supports a bit more than just image file recovery
[21:44] <deadmund> "image file" recovery?
[21:44] <Gnea> never used it
[21:44] <Gnea> yes, images, like jpegs, gifs, png, tif, etc
[21:45] <gool_> dpurgert
[21:45] <Gnea> PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost pictures from digital camera memory or even Hard Disks.
[21:45] <gool_> i think it downloaded
[21:45] <gool_> but i cant find the application

[21:47] <crazybrain> Fred is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
[21:47] <crazybrain> what does that mean?
[21:47] <TheLordOfTime> crazybrain, it means that user isn't allowed to sudo.
[21:47] <jrib> crazybrain: it means your user has not been granted the ability to sudo
[21:48] <bekks> crazybrain: That you tried using sudo as user Fred who is not allowed to do so.
[21:48] <crazybrain> the original admin user account is not working
[21:48] <crazybrain> so i created a new account
[21:48] <F3Speech> Anyone tell me the correct commandto format a pat as swap "sudo mkfs -t swap /dev/sdb1" gives me an error
[21:48] <crazybrain> but whenever i try to install something
[21:48] <jrib> crazybrain: accounts can't sudo by default. You need to grant that ability
[21:48] <TheLordOfTime> crazybrain, creating a new account won't grant sudo.
[21:49] <crazybrain> how can i grant that?
[21:49] <jrib> crazybrain: add the user to the "sudo" group
[21:49] <crazybrain> how?
[21:49] <Ubiquity4321> jamin: apologies. It's a different box. I physically reinstalled the eth0 card. I am trying to not use this card, as it does not support wol (which the onboard nic does)
[21:49] <Gnea> crazybrain: visudo
[21:49] <NuSuey> atlef: meh, mac os works.. ubuntu works.. cant boot to xp ..and I don't see w7 entry in grub :P how to freaking boot w7 ?:D
[21:49] <jrib> crazybrain: log in as a user that can already sudo and run "sudo adduser YOUR_NEW_USER_HERE sudo"
[21:49] <velko> F3Speech, sudo mkswap /dev/something
[21:49] <gool_> why wouldnt apt-get autoremove work for me?
[21:50] <velko> F3Speech, and after that "sudo swapon /dev/something"
[21:50] <jrib> gool_: pastebin what actually happens.  We don't know what you mean by "doesn't work for me"
[21:50] <F3Speech> velko: ty
[21:50] <crazybrain> jrib: i cant run that user
[21:50] <crazybrain> it's not working
[21:50] <jrib> crazybrain: then choose "recovery mode" from the grub menu
[21:50] <atlef> NuSuey, your setup seems too complicated for me to get into
[21:50] <crazybrain> thats why i created a new one
[21:50] <NuSuey> atlef: true :P :( well.. my fault..
[21:50] <jrib> crazybrain: how did you create a new one?
[21:51] <crazybrain> well at that time it was working
[21:51] <NuSuey> atlef: guess I'll be using the magic of google
[21:51] <jrib> crazybrain: ok, well use recovery mode then.
[21:51] <anders2_> Ubuntu on Nexus 7, any experts?
[21:51] <k1l> anders2_: #ubuntu-arm
[21:51] <Ubiquity4321> jamin: i reconnected to the eth0 card  to download dhcpdump. I am now physically disconnected from the eth0 card and physically reconnected to the (nonworking) eth1 onboard nic
[21:52] <atlef> NuSuey, maybe rethink how your disks are setup and yes, google or this channel might give you your answers
[21:52] <anders2_> k1l, how do I go there? sorry.
[21:52] <bcbrown19> is there still a ubuntu flavor meant for netbooks?
[21:52] <k1l> anders2_: /join #ubuntu-arm
[21:52] <auronandace> anders2_: /join #channel
[21:52] <NuSuey> atlef: well the guys probably don't have the time, since mostly nobody answers If i ask :P
[21:52] <anders2_> thanks
[21:52] <goddard> does ext4 have a file size limit?
[21:52] <jamin> Ubiquity4321, I'm at a loss... you should see at least the outbound DHCP packet requests...  if you do, but don't see an inbound server response you'd need to verify that the request is making it to the DHCP server
[21:52] <TheLordOfTime> bcbrown19, not specialized, you can use the normal Ubuntu installer, or try one of the variant flavors of Ubuntu
[21:52] <auronandace> goddard: yes
[21:52] <ActionParsnip> goddard: yes, all filesystems do
[21:53] <jamin> I suspect the request is never making it off the box
[21:53] <ActionParsnip> goddard: its massive though, i wouldnt worry about it :)
[21:53] <goddard> 3TB ?
[21:53] <Gnea> goddard: 16 terrabytes
[21:53] <atlef> NuSuey, not to offend, but it seems your setup is somewhat unique
[21:53] <goddard> i created a new file system and formatted my disk but it is only 2.2TB
[21:53] <NuSuey> atlef: no offense taken :P
[21:53] <ActionParsnip> goddard: 16Tb is the largest single file size
[21:53] <atlef> NuSuey, good
[21:53] <velko> bcbrown19, no more. just grab one of the flawors and see if it suits your need
[21:54] <ActionParsnip> goddard: 1Eb is the largest volume size
[21:54] <Gnea> goddard: what's the problem?
[21:54] <Ubiquity4321> jamin: let me run dhcpdump
[21:54] <goddard> I must of done the formatting wrong because the volume is suppose to be 3TB
[21:54] <Gnea> "must have"
[21:54] <NuSuey> atlef: probably good, that I cant boot into windows.. more time in ubuntu.. WOHOOO :P
[21:54] <ActionParsnip> goddard: did you use 4k block size?
[21:55] <crazybrain> jrib: still not working
[21:55] <goddard> 4096 is the block size
[21:55] <crazybrain> i did that
[21:55] <crazybrain> by switching user
[21:55] <atlef> NuSuey, as long as you do not miss it
[21:55] <jrib> crazybrain: I don't know what you did to try to fix it.  And I don't know what "still not working" means.  Be more specific.
[21:55] <laos> Hi everyone. I installed LAMP through ZPanel, and while Pear is being picked up by /cli/ apache2/php.ini is not seeing pear, would anyone have any idea how to perhaps resolve this?
[21:55] <Gnea> goddard: what is the output of df -Th ?
[21:55] <crazybrain> jrib: i did sudo adduser fred sudo
[21:55] <NuSuey> atlef: just some things. and im trying to find alternatives for those in linux, or just run that with wine..
[21:55] <crazybrain> then it said done
[21:55] <jrib> crazybrain: what was the output?
[21:56] <crazybrain> but when i switched back to fred
[21:56] <bekks> I am wondering how that had been working when the admin user "was not working".
[21:56] <crazybrain> and try to run sudo it showing me same error
[21:56] <atlef> NuSuey, not to offend again, but kind of ooftopic
[21:56] <ActionParsnip> goddard: run:  sudo fdisk -l   what is output please (use a pastebin)
[21:56] <atlef> *offtopic
[21:56] <jrib> crazybrain: what exactly did you run?
[21:56] <gool_> http://pastebin.com/FQwQ4YCE
[21:57] <crazybrain> sudo adduser fred sudo
[21:57] <jrib> crazybrain: and then?
[21:57] <NuSuey> atlef: well.. sorry for trying to have a chat here :) I'm googling some stuff, but I don't wanna use the windows cd to repair the boot for windows, because that would f.. up my ubuntu boot :P
[21:58] <crazybrain> jrib: then it output as done
[21:58] <bekks> crazybrain: You said the "admin user was not working" - what exactly was/is not working?
[21:58] <crazybrain> sudo is not working
[21:58] <jrib> crazybrain: after it said "done", what did you do?
[21:58] <crazybrain> bekks: i switched back to fred
[21:59] <jrib> crazybrain: how?
[21:59] <crazybrain> and try to run sudo
[21:59] <Gnea> crazybrain: you have to logout and login again
[21:59] <anuvrat> installing on 2TB hdd, I have set bios_grub on on a 100 mb partition, grub-installed worked perfectly, still the computer complains that it can't find anything to boot from. What to do?
[21:59] <atlef> NuSuey, but it is getting late, need to go. good luck though. it is almost midnight
[21:59] <gool_> http://pastebin.com/hQ9m3XPv
[21:59] <NuSuey> atlef: good night then :) and thanks!
[21:59] <gool_> can anyone take a look at that to explain my issue? much thanks if so
[21:59] <atlef> np
[22:00] <bcbrown19> velko: ah thanks. I think probably a fluxbuntu would be best or something. Too bad. The old netbook flavors were awesome.
[22:00] <ActionParsnip> gool_: if you run:  apt-cache policy skype     what is output (please use pastebin again).
[22:00] <velko> bcbrown19, i was also a big fan. even ported the first one to debian proper
[22:00] <Ubiquity4321> jamin: so what do i do now?
[22:01] <Ubiquity4321> can anyone else help me configure my network?

[22:02] <ActionParsnip> Ubiquity4321: does DHCP not fill the needs
[22:02] <jrib> gool_: to install skype, apt needs to install skype-bin but it can't.  This is usually because either you are using repositories not meant for your distribution or you've installed packages not meant for your distribution
=== Ubiquity4321 is now known as Alabaster_W
[22:02] <gool_> does that mean the latest version of skype for linux doesnt work for the newest version of ubuntu?
[22:02] <velko> gool_, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=773851 (unable to resolve host)
[22:02] <jrib> gool_: no
[22:03] <ActionParsnip> gool_: sudo apt-get --purge remove skype-bin; sudo apt-get install skype
[22:03] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: can you state your question another way?
[22:03] <gool_> actionparsnip
[22:03] <gool_> skype-bin is not installed so not removede
[22:04] <ActionParsnip> Alabaster_W: which question
[22:04] <ActionParsnip> Alabaster_W: ahh, nick change
[22:04] <Alabaster_W> [17:02:10] <ActionParsnip> Ubiquity4321: does DHCP not fill the needs
[22:04] <Alabaster_W> yeah, sorry
[22:04] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: I get the error "nouveau.blacklist=1" when I add it to the boot parameters.
=== Alabaster_W is now known as Ubiquity4321
[22:04] <ActionParsnip> Alabaster_W: by default, interfaces will use DHCP. Is this not sufficient to setup the interfaces
[22:04] <jrib> gool_: pastebin the output of "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install skype-bin; apt-cache policy skype-bin
[22:04] <TheLordOfTime> Ubiquity4321, mind *not* changing nicks quickly?  ;)

[22:05] <TheLordOfTime> like that.
[22:05] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: you don't add the quotes. Just delete the:  quiet splash   and add:  nouveau.blacklist=1
[22:05] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: it's not working for some reason
[22:05] <laos> Hi everyone. I installed LAMP through ZPanel, and while Pear is being picked up by /cli/ apache2/php.ini is not seeing pear, would anyone have any idea how to perhaps resolve this?
[22:05] <velko> gool_, have you tinkered with /etc/hostname and/or /etc/hosts? the error you get indicates that you did
[22:06] <Alabaster_W> TheLordOfTime: i'm using kvirc on windows. It's automatically doing it. Let me remove that option
[22:06] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: I didnt use the quotes, but I also didnt delete quite splash, is that important
[22:06] <goddard> ActionParsnip: http://pastebin.com/y4atSpft
[22:06] <ActionParsnip> Maverick_Hunter: it can help
[22:06] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: i'm sorry about the nick change
[22:06] <gool_> i did velko
[22:06] <Maverick_Hunter> ActionParsnip: I'll give it a go, thanks again
[22:07] <ActionParsnip> goddard: ok its seen as a 3Tb drive, that's good
[22:07] <velko> gool_, look at this forum thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=799896
[22:07] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: anyway, dhcp isn't configuring for some reason
[22:08] <ActionParsnip> Alabaster_W: is it wired or wireless
[22:08] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: it is wired
[22:08] <goddard> ActionParsnip: i tried using the Gparted gui to resize the drive and it cant
[22:08] <gool_> velko
[22:08] <gool_> i read that but there was nothing to read
[22:08] <ActionParsnip> Alabaster_W: are there flashing LEDs around the physical port?
[22:08] <goddard> ActionParsnip: it is seen as being a 2.7 TB drive to Gparted
[22:08] <gool_> how to i fix my hostname? im now aware of it.
[22:09] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: there are not
[22:09] <ActionParsnip> goddard: thats fine, you'll never get exactly 3Tb
[22:09] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: it's just a unblinking led
[22:09] <ActionParsnip> Alabaster_W: are there LEDs which aren't flashing, one green and one orange
[22:09] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: all are green
[22:09] <ActionParsnip> Alabaster_W: reseat the cable on both ends is a good first move
[22:12] <jrib> gool_: your hostname error is unrelated, but you can fix it by editing your /etc/hosts
[22:12] <jrib> !hostname | gool_

[22:16] <gool_> ok
[22:16] <Heart^Killer> hmm ok thx AcerAspire1ne
[22:16] <gool_> why would my current hostname

[22:16] <gool_> im confused.
[22:16] <DIL> it your host file you need to define it
[22:16] <Heart^Killer> thanks i mean ActionParsnip
[22:17] <jrib> gool_: probably because your hostname in /etc/hostname is not listed in /etc/hosts
[22:17] <Alabaster_W> ActionParsnip: sudo ifup -v eth1 returns "ifup: interface eth1 already configured"
[22:17] <alex__> o:

[22:42] <gool_> ubiquity4321
[22:42] <Heart^Killer> ok thx ActionParsnip :)
[22:42] <gool_> i tried something with aptitude
[22:42] <gool_> idk what to do now
[22:43] <gool_> all i want is skype so i dont have to switch to windows 7 to skype my girlfriend, lol.
[22:43] <dpurgert> gool_: did you download the installer from the skype website?
[22:43] <Ubiquity4321> gool_: can you search for the .deb? or go into the software center?
[22:43] <ActionParsnip> Heart^Killer: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:argos66/ppa-phpclamav; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install php-clamav
[22:43] <jrib> gool_: go to skype.com and download the deb they provide
[22:43] <Ubiquity4321> ^
[22:43] <dpurgert> Ubiquity4321, I just checked there -- there's not a skype package in the software center. However, it's a deb on the website...
[22:44] <jamin> Ubiquity4321, that chipset is more than a little problematic under Linux
[22:44] <Ubiquity4321> jamin: ahhh
[22:44] <Ubiquity4321> jamin: well, i got it for free so i'm not complaining
[22:44] <Heart^Killer> mmm
[22:44] <gool_> error wrong architecture i186
[22:44] <gool_> does that mean im on 12.10 or whatever
[22:44] <gool_> ?
[22:45] <ActionParsnip> gool_: grab the 64bit deb, your OS is 64bit
[22:45] <jrib> gool_: it means you probably need to enable multi-arch
[22:45] <MonkeyDust> gool_  it's i386, not i186
[22:45] <Heart^Killer> ActionParsnip above commands didnt find any packages :(
[22:45] <ActionParsnip> Heart^Killer: run it in a terminal
[22:45] <Heart^Killer> i am running it via putty
[22:45] <Heart^Killer> is that why i am getting this error?

[22:49] <Heart^Killer> sure
[22:49] <ActionParsnip> Heart^Killer: just saying "still no" doesn't help anyone much at all

[22:51] <EndUserX> I have a file permissions question about a windows partition, need advice
[22:52] <jrib> sw: you don't have TCPKeepAlive yes in your sshd_config?
[22:52] <gool_> and now i click it and it says "dependency is not satisfiable libasounds2 (>=1.0.23)
[22:52] <sw> jrib: Don't know, I'll check. So this is a Ubuntu specific thing?
[22:52] <gool_> in ubuntu software center
[22:52] <ActionParsnip> Heart^Killer: what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
[22:53] <blbrown_win3> I did a full install of ubuntu on a windows machine.  I know it may not be possible, but is there a way to tap into that former windows partition.  There is no data analytics or something that computer forensic people use
[22:53] <EndUserX> I am accessing a VBox VM on my Windows partition, currently I need to provide the sudo password to mount the partition to run the VM
[22:53] <jrib> gool_: when you say click "it" we have no idea what "it" is
[22:53] <EndUserX> Is it insecure to run the VM from a partition mounted with the sudo password?
[22:53] <Heart^Killer> ActionParsnip: http://pastebin.com/A6DpFsVu
[22:54] <gool_> i doubleclick the multi-arch deb i just downloaded (12.04) from skype.com, it goes to ubuntu software center, and says Error and "dependency is not satisfiable: libasound (>=1.023)
[22:54] <ActionParsnip> Heart^Killer: naty is EOL no longer supported in any way
[22:54] <dpurgert> EndUserX, no different that giving program that's running your sudo password if you're on a standalone ubuntu install ...
[22:54] <ActionParsnip> gool_: install it in terminal
[22:54] <Heart^Killer> mmm
[22:55] <EndUserX> dpurgert so in other words doing that is akin to running VBox as root
[22:55] <gool_> still shows up with unmet dependencies
[22:55] <jrib> gool_: out of curiousity what happens with "sudo apt-get install skype" now?
[22:55] <Heart^Killer> what am i supposed to do ActionParsnip?
[22:55] <mesquka> EndUserX: Yes, pretty much
[22:56] <EndUserX> yikes
[22:56] <jamin> jrib, can't use apt-get to install a local package...
[22:56] <dpurgert> EndUserX, maybe I'm misunderstanding you then ... you have a Ubuntu install in VBox, running on a Windows host machine, yeah?
[22:56] <jrib> jamin: skype is in partner repos.  But I just now noticed that skype-bin is only i386
[22:56] <gool_> http://pastebin.com/i4m13G9d
[22:56] <jrib> jamin: so my guess is gool_ downloaded the wrong .deb.  But I figured we'd try the repos again since we just enabled i386
[22:57] <EndUserX> nope I am dual booting and I am running a VM I installed on a windows host by accessing it in VBox from a Linux host in order to share it
[22:57] <jrib> gool_: run "sudo apt-get update" then try again
=== sw is now known as sw6
[22:57] <dpurgert> OK, so the "host" machine for this vbox is on linux
[22:57] <EndUserX> but to run that VM off the windows partition I have to mount the partition using sudo
[22:58] <zivester> does anyone know where the mail queue is located on ubuntu 12.04?
[22:58] <dpurgert> if something running inside of vbox needs root (e.g. apt), then the root access is limited to that machine (i.e. it's not executing stuff as root on the host)
[22:59] <mesquka> EndUserX: Is the host machine asking for a sudo password or the guest machine?
[22:59] <EndUserX> the host needs to mount the windows partition where the VM lives as sudo
[22:59] <EndUserX> then VBox can run it
[22:59] <gool_> it is doing some installation, but out of curiosity is skype this difficult to install for ubuntu or did i just screw something up?
[22:59] <dpurgert> well, yeah
[23:00] <dpurgert> "mount" musty be run as root
[23:00] <dpurgert> *must ... curse you keyboard
[23:00] <jrib> gool_: if you had had mult-arch enabled it should have worked.  Is this a fresh install or an upgrade?  What was the original install version?
[23:00] <gool_> fresh install
[23:00] <EndUserX> but I am thinking that may be a bad thing to run a VM from a partition mounted that way security wise but I am not sure
[23:00] <jrib> gool_: k.  Well I guess they don't enable multi-arch by default :P
[23:00] <MonkeyDust> gool_  in software center, i deleted everything skype, then reinstalled it, in software center => now works like a charm
[23:01] <jeremycook> Hey everyone. I have a question about getting a piece of hardware to work and was wondering if this was the right place to ask.
[23:01] <stefan_> I'm still having audio problems on Ubuntu 12.10. http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=d36774257b1cc8fa4265e2b21aade235a5e750c2
[23:01] <dpurgert> EndUserX, _all_ partitions are mounted as "root" there's no way around that (only root can run "mount")
[23:01] <gool_> monkey i think i did that a bit earlier, it is now unpacking libaudio2
[23:01] <gool_> which was the problem i faced before
[23:01] <dpurgert> jeremycook, probably
[23:01] <jeremycook> dpurgert: Thanks.
[23:01] <dpurgert> gool_, sounds like you may have nailed the problem
[23:02] <EndUserX> dpurgert see that is where I was confused because at some level even the host is running things as root such as daemons etc
[23:02] <jeremycook> I have a fresh install of Ubuntu 12.10 on an HP Envy 17 1000 series.
[23:02] <dpurgert> jeremycook, what do you need help with?
[23:02] <gool_> yeah
[23:02] <gool_> this is awesome, glad i looked into this irc
[23:02] <vitimiti> o/
[23:02] <gool_> thanks for all the help so far, even if it doesnt work
[23:02] <jeremycook> Almost everything works perfectly except for the subwoofer in the laptop, which I can't make work at all.
[23:02] <jeremycook> I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on how to get this working.
[23:02] <EndUserX> dpurgert so what you are saying that it is no different than what the host is doing to run the deep sys level stuff
[23:02] <dpurgert> EndUserX, yup ... just don't do anything dumb (install a trojan) and you should be OK though
[23:03] <jeremycook> I've pretty much tried everything I could find on this on Google.
[23:03] <gool_> off topic here, but does anyone use python or arduino in here?
[23:03] <EndUserX> dpurgert would changing fstab to automatically mount without password add a layer of security to it though
[23:03] <EndUserX> I'd prefer not to automount
[23:03] <dpurgert> EndUserX, well, no ... since fstab is mounting everything as root anyway
[23:04] <ultralinux> hola
[23:04] <EndUserX> dpurgert I gotcha
[23:04] <ultralinux> alguien español?
[23:04] <lordinvader> Hi! I'm using Ubuntu 12.04, and am facing a strange issue - I'm using a combo TRRS headphone-mic (laptop - HP Pavillion dv6 6165tx). If I insert the headphone into the jack fully, the sound comes out muffled. Works fine if I insert it only partially. Problem doesn't exist with inbuilt speakers or my external 4.1 speakers with TRS jack. Any idea? Thanks a lot.  I found people reporting similar issues with other distros on googling,

[23:05] <EndUserX> dpurgert thanks, I will just leave it as is and mount the partition with my password when I need VBox to access the VM on that partition then

[23:05] <gool_> thank you very much, jrib and friends
[23:05] <dpurgert> EndUserX, really mounting the drive shouldn't be a concern to you -- once mounted, it's no different than having a vbox partition running "native" off your install

[23:10] <qwebirc51592> dpurgert, it's a brand new build so I don't think dust buildup is causing it
[23:10] <qwebirc51592> though it does sound like it's running hot and loud.  5/8 GB RAM used, which is very uncommon

[23:10] <danfo> is there any way ufw could be blocking a unix socket when enabled?
[23:11] <warfar> how do i fix that
[23:11] <dpurgert> qwebirc51592, well, that helps.  Airflow issue due to bad cable management (not that I know from experience ... )
[23:11] <qwebirc51592> SSH is still up, websites still respond but VNC doesn't, audio/video frozen on screen
[23:11] <qwebirc51592> ah ok, yeah there's a 850W PS in a MiniITX case... lots of cables and whatnot
[23:11] <qwebirc51592> happens when in Windows too
[23:11] <Regretfulone> does linux not work well with the Intel HD4000 integrated graphics? I can get it to work correctly with a VGA but not an HDMI
[23:12] <dpurgert> well, if it was just a problem in Win --> format that partition off :)
[23:12] <warfar> how do i fix http://pastebin.com/iaQyJpeS
[23:13] <dpurgert> ram usage seems high -- could be VNC choking (kill it).  if it's only VNC then there's something weird with the configuration I guess
[23:13] <dpurgert> warfar, looks like you have some dependency errors for linux-signed-generic
[23:14] <warfar> how do i fix them?
[23:15] <dpurgert> apt-get build-dep linux ... should be able to fix the dependencies.  alternative apt-get -f install linux... will (hopefully) do the same thing and then install the package
[23:15] <warfar> E: Unable to find a source package for linux-meta
[23:15] <dpurgert> qwebirc51592, though, to be honest, I'm not so good with VNC ... I prefer hitting up my remote boxes with straight SSH
[23:16] <dpurgert> well, that's not good warfar.
[23:16] <warfar> i screwed up my windows partion and i need a disk hex editor to fix it
[23:16] <warfar> :P
[23:16] <qwebirc51592> dpurgert: I think VNC is the symptom of video card / Xorg fail
[23:17] <dpurgert> qwebirc51592, could be that too; which then points to "not enough airflow" again
[23:17] <lordinvader> Sound problem - audio muffled unless earphones (TRRS) halfway inserted. Ubuntu 12.04/HP dv6 6165tx. Any solutions? Thanks a lot
[23:18] <qwebirc51592> dpurgert: is there a command for printing out temperature stats? or how can I use top to figure out what's using all that RAm
[23:18] <lordinvader> qwebirc51592 - you can try installing lm-sensors

I also can't seem to get it to boot live; I've tried the 12.04 live cd as well as a "rescue remix". The 12.04 live cd never finishes booting. The rescue remix doesn't even attempt to boot from cd; it skips straight to the hard drive even though it boots fine on my desktop. Any thoughts on how to get this
[23:28] <dpurgert> open a terminal, then "sudo apt-get update && sudo -qyb dist-upgrade"
[23:28] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: was that directed at me or soup? I was going to ask how to manually update it because I am still a bit new with this
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> warfar: getdeb has it but its down, could try ghex
[23:29] <Tigger664> hi
[23:29] <warfar> http://pastebin.com/1w92CYJg
[23:29] <warfar> already have ghex no disk edit feature
[23:29] <dpurgert> Regretfulone, was for you
[23:29] <Tigger664> erm hey i need help im ... a ubuntu virgin and i feel im stuck in the deep end xD
[23:29] <alcaprawn> sup Tigger664
[23:30] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: thanks I will try that
[23:30] <dpurgert> Tigger664, OK, what do you need help with?
[23:30] <alcaprawn> dpurgert: always see you'r name pop up
[23:30] <Tigger664> im trying to install a server on a ubuntu Dedicated but i cant work it out
[23:30] <ActionParsnip> warfar: could compile wxhexeditor I guess
[23:30] <alcaprawn> Tigger664: i pm'ed you
[23:31] <gool_> if i have an installed webcam (its built in to my laptop), how do i get it to show up for other programs to use? do i need drivers specifically for linux?
[23:31] <warfar> no idea how
[23:31] <ActionParsnip> warfar: there are some PPAs but they are for older releases, you could ask to see if one of the maintainers intends to add the app for quantal
[23:31] <warfar> http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-12.10/getdeb-apps-amd64/wxhexeditor_0.20-1~getdeb1_amd64.deb.html
[23:31] <warfar> i found that
[23:31] <dpurgert> alcaprawn, I try ... find that helping people with their problems helps me better learn the box
[23:31] <lordinvader> gool : it was automatically detected by skype in my dv6
[23:32] <dpurgert> gool_, yes, probably, depends on whether the driver is included native in the kernel ( MOST hardware these days, sans gfx, are native/autodetected)
[23:33] <gool_> according to google, ubuntu has UVC on it?
[23:33] <gool_> is that what is used for video?
[23:34] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: the apt-get worked the second command did not, return error is -q invalid option
[23:34] <gool_> my webcam shows up when i type "lsusb" but it isnt being detected by programs
[23:35] <dpurgert> Regretfulone, hm ... lemme chk, probably transposed the options with the command
[23:36] <ActionParsnip> gool_: if you run cheese, do you see yourself. The fact it shows in lsusb only means the OS sees it, doesn't mean it is configured
[23:36] <dpurgert> Regretfulone, yeah, I'm a moron -- the right command is "sudo apt-get -qyb dist-upgrade"
[23:36] <gool_> it doesnt show up on cheese
[23:36] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: ah thanks, I will give that a try
[23:37] <warfar> how do i select my windows partion from a hexeditor run in wine?
[23:38] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: and the error piles in :/ it is just going 'something wicked happened resolving 'us.archive.ubuntu.com:http' (-5 no address associated with hostname)
[23:38] <dpurgert> well, that's bad -- you can't get at the repo
[23:39] <dpurgert> brb, fixing my dchp server (so will probably DC)
[23:40] <Regretfulone> hmm is there a way to fix this so that I can connect to the repo? it just repeats the error for each files it tries to donwload
[23:41] <soupwell1> Can anyone help me get my root partition to mount read/write? I haven't had success booting from disc or usb.

[23:44] <dpurgert> guess it did break things :)
[23:44] <alcaprawn> what media, centre do you guys suggest?
[23:45] <alcaprawn> liveb00table os blah u get it?
[23:45] <dniMretsaM> alcaprawn: XBMC
[23:45] <alcaprawn> dniMretsaM: , im downloading that atm gonna give that ago
[23:45] <dniMretsaM> it's pretty much the best there is. even runs from a Raspberry Pi
[23:45] <alcaprawn> seems to half decent, on the readups
[23:45] <alcaprawn> yeh i read that too dniMretsaM do you own a pi?
[23:46] <dniMretsaM> I do
[23:46] <alcaprawn> how u finding it mate?
[23:46] <dniMretsaM> own a Pi, that is
[23:46] <Lunar_Lander> hi, I just came back from locking my screen, moved the mouse and then I could see my desktop background but the Password prompt didn't appear, so I had to switch off power to get back working
[23:46] <alcaprawn> i was thinking about buying one, but i bought a new wifi adaptor this week :p
[23:46] <Lunar_Lander> anybody had that also?
[23:46] <alcaprawn> ah okay fair enough :p
=== root is now known as Macscroge
[23:46] <dpurgert> need to get another one or three of those. great little things
[23:46] <dniMretsaM> it's pretty cool. Haven't really done much with it yet, though
[23:46] <alcaprawn> Lunar_Lander: you have koreans in you're pc. Sorry To Say
[23:47] <Lunar_Lander> ?
[23:47] <dpurgert> Lunar_Lander, did you happen to feed Gizmo after midnight and/or get him wet?
[23:47] <alcaprawn> :D
[23:47] <alcaprawn> http://wallbase.cc sick site.
[23:47] <warfar> how do i open an exexcutable?
[23:47] <dniMretsaM> I'm currently trying to come up with a project idea for it, but the two I've had have tanked. but this is OT, so...
[23:47] <alcaprawn> for all your wallpaper needs!
[23:48] <Lunar_Lander> ah, I just wanted to ask what crap bug that is
[23:48] <Lunar_Lander> do you tell me that is a virus from Korea?
[23:48] <alcaprawn> it has bugs. find them and fix them
[23:48] <dpurgert> warfar, like a windows *.exe ?
[23:48] <warfar> no
[23:48] <warfar> a linuxone
[23:48] <dniMretsaM> warfar: open up a terminal and type ./filename
[23:48] <alcaprawn> Lunar_Lander: the ship is sinking fast. lets head over to the docks.
[23:48] <dniMretsaM> (replace "filename" with the name of the executable, obviously)
[23:49] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: so you were saying that it is a problem connecting to the repo?
[23:49] <dniMretsaM> warfar: there are ways of setting your file manager up to let you run them by clicking on them, too.
[23:49] <dpurgert> Lunar_Lander, I've had it happen on occasion ... in my case, it was X acting up, and alt+F2 (to start a terminal) then kill X, and restart X fixed it
[23:50] <kylescottmcgill> if my keyboard randomly dies, how can reload it or check it from a console for error messages or something? dmesg has nothing
[23:50] <Lunar_Lander> hm ok dpurgert
[23:50] <Lunar_Lander> thanks again
[23:50] <Lunar_Lander> good night
[23:51] <dpurgert> Regretfulone, yeah, that's what it seemed -- I mean, the error was "can't connect to (site)"
[23:51] <alcaprawn> how to get rid of the stupid ati-watermark? with the latest offical beta-drivers
[23:51] <alcaprawn> can it be done?!?
[23:52] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: yeah I had a feeling but I am confused as to why it happens and oddly as soon as it finishes with those errors, my computer drops its internet connection and won't reconnect til I restart the computer
[23:52] <dpurgert> NIC dying?
[23:53] <Regretfulone> not sure what that is ><
[23:54] <dpurgert> Regretfulone, instead of restarting the computer, you can also try either "sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0" or "sudo ifconfig eth0 down && sudo ifconfig eth0 up"
[23:54] <kylescottmcgill> nevermind guys! found log entries in xorg.0.log :D
[23:55] <dpurgert> kylescottmcgill, good deal
[23:55] <warfar> http://pastebin.com/wxnR0DJT
[23:55] <Regretfulone> dpurgert: the software updater just popped up as well, I am trying to reestablish the wireless connection
[23:56] <dpurgert> oh, wireless
[23:56] <dniMretsaM> warfar: looks like errors in the code to me.
[23:56] <warfar> how do i fix them?
[23:57] <dpurgert> Regretfulone, could be that the wireless is dropping out at the router/ap then
[23:57] <dpurgert> though, TBH, that shouldn't necessitate a restart
[23:57] <kylescottmcgill> Regretfulone: if your internet drops out, try sudo service network-manager restart
[23:57] <Regretfulone> after it drops out like it did, it doesnt matter if I put the correct password in it won't connect unless I restart
[23:57] <kylescottmcgill> Regretfulone: yeah try the above command
[23:57] <dniMretsaM> warfar: fix the code
[23:58] <warfar> isn't mione
[23:58] <dniMretsaM> then talk to the evs
[23:58] <kylescottmcgill> i have a mac with broadcom and mines dies all the time, and it fails to reconnect until i do that... its a bug in the code... thats my use case anyway
[23:58] <dniMretsaM> s/evs/devs/
[23:58] <dpurgert> Regretfulone, use the command from kylescottmcgill ... or plug into a wired connection ... or restart the router/ap (or a combination thereof)
[23:59] <ActionParsnip> Regretfulone: unload and reload the driver module
[23:59] <dniMretsaM> warfar: or you can fix them yourself if you know how to
[23:59] <kylescottmcgill> if you are using gnome, you can right click on the wifi applet thing in your sys tray and Disable Netowkring, and Re-enable it again
[23:59] <warfar> nope no idea
[23:59] <kylescottmcgill> it does the same thing
[23:59] <Regretfulone> i restarted the network manager and now I don't think the wireless adapter is working
