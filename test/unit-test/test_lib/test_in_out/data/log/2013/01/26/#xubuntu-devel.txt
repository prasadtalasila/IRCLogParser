[14:13] <ochosi> maddernick: i added some padding to the spinner: http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-01262013-031301pm.php
[14:15] <maddernick> ochosi: okay cool
[14:15] <ochosi> also, at least in plymouth-x11 it's spinning too fast
[14:16] <ochosi> i tuned that down a little
[14:16] <ochosi> s/0.2/0.1/
[14:16] <ochosi> not sure, maybe that's different when it's used nativel
[14:16] <ochosi> y
[14:16] <maddernick> i think its called 50 times per second
[14:17] <ochosi> and i have to talk to knome about that, but i think a "path" for the circle-sector to move on would look nicer
[14:17] <maddernick> path?
[14:17] <ochosi> basically a semi-transparent circle
[14:17] <ochosi> now it's rotating in thin air
[14:17] <maddernick> ye
[14:18] <ochosi> i guess for that to happen, the spinner would have to be larger
[14:18] <ochosi> err
[14:18] <ochosi> i mean: i have to take a look at the png first :)
[14:20] <ochosi> something like this: http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-01262013-032026pm.php

[22:28] <souperk> hello..
[23:15] <souperk> guys :( if someone can help me I will be glad
[23:15] <souperk> i'm desperately trying to show all console messages at boot
[23:15] <souperk> but I can't find a way :(
[23:15] <souperk> i have edited grub file
[23:15] <souperk> where i have the line: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
[23:15] <souperk> i modified it with: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=
[23:16] <souperk> but it doesnt work.
[23:16] <souperk> then I modified it with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet"
[23:16] <souperk> and still no console messages at boot
[23:16] <souperk> just the usual black screen before the desktop.
[23:17] <souperk> so ... is there a way to show all console messages while xubuntu is booting up??
[23:17] <souperk> and if yes.. how?
