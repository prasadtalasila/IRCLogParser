[18:07] <krywk> I need help with ardour2.
[18:08] <krywk> I'm wanting to monitor and record more than one track, but I don't know how to do it.
[18:08] <krywk> Only the first track gets monitored and recorded.
[18:08] <krywk> The other ones return silence and no monitoring when pressing the 'record' button.
[18:09] <krywk> Any help? :/
[18:11] <krywk> I'm guessing it can be done by connecting the outputs of vst_guitarrig5 (vsthost) to the inputs of each track?
[18:12] <krywk> Well, nevermind.
[23:22] <FloatingGoat> hello
