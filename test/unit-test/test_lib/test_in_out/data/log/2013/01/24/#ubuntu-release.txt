[00:16] <infinity> Bah, someone remind me what breakage leads to the NBS report being empty when it shouldn't be?

[00:24] <cjwatson> I've done that, hopefully that'll clear it

[17:30] <Laney> it was ABORTed
[17:31] <cjwatson> it's back now
[17:31] <infinity> Uhm, yeah.  Looks like a network event took out half the world.
[17:32] <cjwatson> infinity: Most of the half of the world you're looking at is pandabox relocation.

[18:59] <infinity> slangasek: ^-- Looks like that's the Libreoffice upload you said you'd expedite review on? :)
[18:59] <slangasek> correct
[18:59]  * infinity does some reviewing too, since clearly what we need right now is longer buildd queues.
[19:42] <antarus> holy lord this channel posts when things are uploaded
[19:42] <antarus> <3
[19:53] <stgraber> antarus: just when things get queued for review. dev release uploads (except during freeze) won't show up in here (it'd flood the channel)
[20:00] <xnox> antarus: wellcome to the important channel where import things happen. For example the ongoing debate of which is better green tea vs green tea with lemon extracts is still unresolved.
[20:08] <xnox> infinity: thanks for approving alsa-* =)))
[20:10] <infinity> xnox: Black tea.  Green tea is for management.
[20:10] <infinity> xnox: And you're welcome.

[20:40] <bdmurray> infinity: thanks
[20:46] <bdmurray> infinity: how about mrtg in oneiric too?  clint asked for a clear test case in august and did not get one and subsquently there has bee no verification.
[20:49] <infinity> bdmurray: Oh, I was about to say "that's only been in proposed for 7 days"...
[20:49] <infinity> bdmurray: And then I checked the year.
[20:53] <infinity> bdmurray: Done.
[21:46] <bdmurray> infinity: nis could be removed from oneiric-proposed
[21:48] <infinity> Say, did we clear out natty-proposed when it went EOL?
[21:49] <infinity> bdmurray: We could just wait for a few months and remove everything from oneiric-proposed without need for review.
[21:50] <bdmurray> infinity: I don't think we did clear out natty, I'm just working on a reviewing tool and testing with oneiric.
[21:52] <infinity> We should have if we didn't.  Oh well.  Should probably put that on the EOL checklist.

[22:53] <ScottK> bdmurray: Could you arrange for the package name to be at the start of the subject line of your verification still needed mails?  It would help a lot.
[22:56] <bdmurray> ScottK: sure
[22:57] <bdmurray> How about verification of $pkg still needed
[23:01] <ScottK> I'd prefer $pkg verification still needed, but that would definitely be better.
