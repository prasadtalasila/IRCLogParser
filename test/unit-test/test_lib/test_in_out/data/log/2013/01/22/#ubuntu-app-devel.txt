[22:00] <airglide> hello everyone, i need some help, I've made an application and I want to link the files with a specific extension to the program and give it an icon, I've tried creating a mime type and then copying a .svg in to /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable, but it doesn't work. Do I have to connect the icon somehow to the mimetype?
