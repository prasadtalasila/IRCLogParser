[01:29] <micahg> gah, 1.5MB larger....
[01:30] <knome> mmh
[01:34] <knome> sleepy time!
[01:34] <knome> ->
[04:38]  * micahg sees ISOs ballooning, time to drop more stuff
[10:45] <knome> micahg, hurrr
[10:45] <knome> micahg, any ideas of the cause?
[14:42]  * kurapika is away: Je suis pu lÃ  >.<
[16:24] <knome> kurapika, please don't use public away messages. thanks!
[18:10] <knome> maddernick, btw, how's the uploading your code for plymouth going?
[18:10] <knome> maddernick, you need anything from us before you do that?
[18:36] <maddernick> knome: it is uploaded
[18:37] <maddernick> i did it around new years iirc, but i do need the new spinner
[18:37] <maddernick> well i dont "need" it, but if i got it i would be done to the visual extent i suppose, i do need measurements regardless
[18:38] <knome> it should be the same size you received
[18:38] <knome> not done yet though
[18:38] <knome> can you point ochosi to your branch?
[18:39] <maddernick> i did :P
[18:39] <knome> can you do it again? i suppose he's lost the link :P
[18:39] <maddernick> oh okay
[18:39] <knome> and sorry for asking again :P
[18:40] <knome> i've been only partly monitoring the process so i don't know all the details
[18:40] <knome> i just heard he's waiting for some code somewhere :P
[18:40] <maddernick> knome: i probably need to allow him to push or something, im not sure how to do that
[18:40] <maddernick> https://code.launchpad.net/~dr-madnick/+junk/trunk
[18:40] <knome> ochosi, ^
[18:40] <maddernick> also this is the "pulsating" one
[18:41] <maddernick> the spinner code is acctually present in this
[18:41] <maddernick> but commented out
[18:41] <knome> mmh, that's good
[19:08] <ochosi> well what we need is a merge-request which would best be done by maddernick beacuse itmahould include a changelog
[19:09] <ochosi> unless mr_pouit says otherwise
[19:47] <maddernick> ochosi: just tell me when
