[14:59] <mpt> Hi snwh!!!
[14:59] <mpt> LOUD NOISES
[15:03] <mpt> Oh dear, what did I do
=== meetingology` is now known as meetingology
[15:41] <snwh> mpt, what did you do?
[16:09] <mpt> snwh, you complained how quiet #ubuntu-design was, so I said "Hi snwh!!!" and "LOUD NOISES" and you dropped off IRC immediately
[16:12] <snwh> mpt, oh. I wasn't complaining, it was just an observation. :) -and skype had crashed by computer :/
[16:13] <mpt> You make a valid point, though, we should do more here
[16:13] <snwh> "Topic for #ubuntu-design set by wendar at Fri Dec 16 12:02:30 2011"
[16:13] <snwh> 2011 lol
[16:14] <mpt> Right now I'm designing the fix for bug 1033226
[16:14] <ubot5> bug 1033226 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "No close option, only restart" [Medium,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1033226
[16:15] <snwh> I've been getting feedback from gnome designer regarding an icon I did for dconf-editor (https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7027392/dconf-editor.svg)
[16:16] <mpt> A consummate V
[16:17] <snwh> ?
[16:17] <snwh>  /me googled
[16:17] <mpt> http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail58.html
[16:18] <snwh> i was thinking  consummate as in marriage night
[16:21] <snwh> I'm still confused.
[16:22] <mpt> "And then, using consummate Vs, give him teeth, spinities, and angry eyebrows."
[16:22] <mpt> Anyway, the point is that that checkmark looks a bit more like a V than a checkmark. :-)
[16:23] <mpt> Moving it to the left would fix that.
[16:25] <snwh> there's an "unmagnified" that's outside the glass too that is unseen on white
[16:25] <snwh> and I did have a smaller 'v' in an older version: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7027392/dconf-editor-alt.svg
[16:37] <snwh> mpt, since you're working on it :P - I've just noticed that the tabs are bit close to the "Techinical Description" https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7027392/updater.png
[16:38] <mpt> snwh, true, I want to merge those tabs into a single field
[16:38] <mpt> but I'd better discuss that with mterry
[16:39] <snwh> I also thought that it doesn't expand very much either -the treeview especially for a long list
[16:39] <mpt> ugh, yeah, expanders are busted in GTK generally
[16:40] <mpt> By default it's supposed to be "tall enough to show six items in the list, with a minimum height of three items"
[16:40] <mpt> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareUpdates#expanded
[16:40] <mpt> But then it doesn't resize properly when you collapse it, so you resize it manually, then when you expand it it tries to obey that manual sizing, etc
[16:41] <snwh> Oh GTK
[16:42] <snwh> speaking of GTK, do you know (or know of someone who can tell me) how the breadcrumbs a la GCC are done? we want to emulate them in unity tweak tool.
[16:43] <mpt> GCC has breadcrumbs?
[16:43] <mpt> oh I see
[16:43] <snwh> the All Settings > Whatever
[16:44] <mpt> snwh, <https://code.launchpad.net/~software-store-developers/software-center/4.0> has better ones, with interlocking buttons
[16:44] <mpt> (we dropped them altogether in 5.0)
[16:46] <snwh> cool, cause right now we have duplication with the toolbar and overview layout https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7027392/utt.png
[17:00] <mpt> If you have just that many panels, you don't need those toolbar buttons at all
[17:01] <mpt> And if you have only two levels of hierarchy -- the table of contents + the individual panels -- you don't need breadcrumbs either
[17:02] <mpt> snwh, you could have something like the navigation mocked up in <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareAndUpdatesSettings?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=drivers-settings.mockup.png> instead.
[17:05] <snwh> mpt, the All Settings button, just being a button to the front page?
