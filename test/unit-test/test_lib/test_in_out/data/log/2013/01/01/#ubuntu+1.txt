[00:27] <scotty^> Hello all.  Is Raring still targetting kernel 3.8.x?
[00:28] <penguin42> don't know and not sure where to find out
[00:29] <scotty^> :) Same here.
[00:30] <penguin42> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/hardware-r-kernel-version-and-flavors  suggests it hasn't settled yet

[13:56] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[13:57] <penguin42> hey
[14:16] <BluesKaj> hi  penguin42 , Happy New Year
[14:16] <penguin42> and to you sir
[15:53] <penguin42> kaffeine on rr is doing a wonderful job with dvb-t
[16:02] <penguin42> hmm a few artifacts when it switches mpeg streams - like between adverts
[16:03] <penguin42> hmm and doesn't like sounds on some of them
[17:49] <penguin42> om26er: Lets see what your topic kicks off then; although I'm only subscribed to one of the lists
[17:50] <om26er> penguin42, my guess subscribed to bugsquad ?
[17:50] <om26er> lets see what comes out of that thread ;)
[17:50] <penguin42> om26er: Yeh, it's in moderation for -desktop
[17:50] <bjsnider> penguin42, any idea if kaffeine supports dvb-s2?
[17:53] <penguin42> om26er: I didn't want to get into a unity-ism so I didn't mention this in my reply, but to be honest I think it's made some difference; I don't run Unity, so I don't know the problems there or the normal things, so I just avoid any unity bug reports
[17:55] <om26er> penguin42, yes unity in many cases is not a simple pacakge like rhythmbox, as there are many chances for the bug being in compiz or some other indicator. its a bit like the linux kernel in complexity (much less;)
[17:55] <penguin42> hey I can have a chance of understanding where to go with the kernel....
[17:56] <om26er> penguin42, i generally do hang around irc if you may need some help with unity things
[17:57] <om26er> the main focus of the post was mostly on the applications that we ship in ubuntu, I believe their packages are seeing less bugs triage activity
[17:57] <om26er> so you are a Doctor :)
[17:58] <penguin42> I am
[17:58] <penguin42> Ph.D. in comp sci; so don't try and ask me to cure your cold
[17:59] <penguin42> om26er: To be honest I'm finding it pretty hard to get fixes in; I find it pretty easy to debug seg fault type of bugs and get a fix (for repeatable thing), it takes me longer to figure out how to get them in
[18:00] <om26er> hah
[18:00] <om26er> penguin42, patch pilot is quite efficient I would say to get your patches uploaded to Ubuntu
[18:01] <penguin42> om26er: Don't seem to be many about these days
[18:01] <om26er> it worked for me quite a lot of time even though I was only backporting other people's work
[18:04] <penguin42> the other thing that seems to be hard is what to do when you spot a bunch of people reporting bugs they can't individually repeat, but which a bunch of people run into
[18:07] <om26er> those are one of the more hurting types of bugs :/
[18:08] <penguin42> they just cycle through years of people being asked to try them on newer versions, set to incomplete, the original reporter never bothers because they gave up, and some new guy ends up tripping over it 5 years later
[18:10] <penguin42> bug 584786 and debian bug 336996 are the one I hit yesterday
[18:10] <ubottu> bug 584786 in usb-creator (Ubuntu) "10.04 Startup USB creator issues" [Undecided,Invalid] https://launchpad.net/bugs/584786
[18:10] <ubottu> Debian bug 336996 in cu "cu Forces Hardware Flow Control" [Normal,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/336996
[18:10] <penguin42> hmm no wrong one
[18:10] <penguin42> bug 584787
[18:10] <ubottu> bug 584787 in uucp (Ubuntu) "cu 1.07-20build1 mispackaged" [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/584787
[18:10] <penguin42> better
[18:14] <om26er> there might be some tag out there to track packaging issues, wont it need to be  fixed in debian ?
[18:15] <penguin42> om26er: I guess so, but it's a mess; there seem to be a few apparently unrelated ways to fix the same symptom; but yes probably needs fixing in debian
[18:16] <penguin42> om26er: Which is why I added alink to that one to the debian bug I just quoted (that was open in '05)
[18:18] <penguin42> om26er: But debian just has stiction at the moment - it's stuck in freeze (apparently since July last year) with no obvious point when it's going to come out
[18:19] <om26er> that bug goes way back,
[18:19] <penguin42> nod, I think since at least 01
[18:19] <om26er> probably get some help from Ubuntu packagers ?
[18:20] <penguin42> yeh maybe
[18:20] <om26er> and never know how debian freezes work :D
[18:20] <penguin42> om26er: Bug 771589 is fun as well - I tracked it down to a y2k bug
[18:20] <ubottu> bug 771589 in fbb (Ubuntu) "fbb buffer overflow" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/771589
[18:21] <penguin42> fixed upstream a few years back, with someone putting a fixed package on that debian bug 3 years ago
[18:21] <ubottu> Error: Debian bug 3 could not be found
[18:21] <penguin42> problem is the debian bug was just a 'please update' since it didn't cause a crash like it does for us
[18:22] <om26er> oh boy
[18:23]  * penguin42 has a little list like this
[18:23] <om26er> so the fix is still not in Ubuntu, if needed a backport in Ubuntu is an option
[18:24] <penguin42> om26er: Well what it really needs is the latest upstream getting merged somewhere; I think I added a one line fix there that we could apply in ubuntu, but that's probably the wrong thing to do since the debian package is ancient - and I don't have the hardware to test that package
[18:25] <om26er> to summarize, the change is merged in upstream debian branches but the fix was never uploaded and hence was not auto synced to Ubuntu ?
[18:27] <penguin42> om26er: Ish, the debian bug attached to that has a newer (but still 3 years old) version of the upstream packaged in it, that includes the fix, but that never got released in debian and hence never got back down to us
[18:27]  * penguin42 suspects a vast part of Universe segs on us
[18:28] <om26er> we keep that list somewhere
[18:28] <om26er> actually thats for FTBFS
[18:29] <penguin42> yeh, there is plenty that builds but segs straight away due to fortify spotting a trivial dumb bug
[18:29] <om26er> penguin42, poke Ubuntu developers, probably on their mailing list
[18:30] <penguin42> om26er: yeh it's just a matter of finding an appropriate one for the particular problem
[18:32] <penguin42> it's also hard telling what to do if upstream is dead; if a package works in debian, but is upstream-dead what do we do?
[18:33] <om26er> kill it ?
[18:33] <penguin42> possibly - but if it works in debian?
[18:35]  * penguin42 mailed the debian maintainer for bug 1086534 for that one
[18:35] <ubottu> bug 1086534 in tcpick (Ubuntu) "*** buffer overflow detected ***: tcpick terminated with -t arg" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086534
[18:36] <om26er> works in debian but doesn't in Ubuntu so there must be a mechanism to blacklist autosync to Ubuntu for specific packages.
[18:36] <penguin42> om26er: Well got a patch to fix it in Ubuntu
[18:36] <om26er> yeah thats a better route ofcoure
[18:37] <penguin42> om26er: so I've been reporting them in debian and upstream if I can find upstream alive
[18:38] <om26er> people will likely (atleast) reply to their emails i guess
[18:38] <penguin42> only some of them
[18:39] <om26er> penguin42, use your @ubuntu ID if got one ;)
[18:39] <penguin42> hmm no I haven't, I guess I should get one
[18:39] <penguin42> has enough email addresses
