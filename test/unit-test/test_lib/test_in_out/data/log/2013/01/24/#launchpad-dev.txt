[00:04] <cjwatson> Great, thanks
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:04] <StevenK> cjwatson: Do you want to cowboy it onto mawson while it plays through buildbot, or what is your plan?
[00:05] <cjwatson> If you have bright ideas on disentangling the underlying cause (notes in the bug), that'd be lovely, or else I'll try to mock something up in tests
[00:05] <cjwatson> StevenK: I was about to go to bed, TBH
[00:06] <StevenK> cjwatson: If you want to crash, I can land it for you
[00:06] <cjwatson> Will it be a problem if I don't QA it until tomorrow afternoon?  I'm going to be out tomorrow morning (hence wanting to go to bed)
[00:06] <cjwatson> Well, I can land it
[00:06] <StevenK> cjwatson: We have one revision waiting, and nothing urgent, so it should be fine
[00:06] <cjwatson> Just QA will be with slightly less alacrity than usual
[00:07] <wgrant> Given that we still have no builders and the change is isolated and trivial, QA on that seems less than essential.
[00:07] <cjwatson> As I suggested in the MP, we can QA this without builders by injecting a production upload
[00:07] <cjwatson> Probably quicker too
[00:08] <wgrant> True
[00:08] <cjwatson> Though I guess we need to mock up the build id in the directory name or something to get it into the right archive, but that's easy enough
[00:09] <cjwatson> Anyway, it's on its way into buildbot, so I'll deal with that tomorrow; feel free to revert if it causes a problem, obviously
[03:37] <StevenK> wgrant: How goes the BFJO murder?
[03:38] <wgrant> I think all the failures are fixed
[03:38] <wgrant> Another ec2 run is 3/4 done
[03:38] <StevenK> Ah, how bad was the ec2 carnage?
[03:38] <wgrant> Only about 60 failures.
[03:39] <StevenK> Not bad.
[03:47] <wgrant> StevenK: Looking
[03:50] <wgrant> StevenK: Does the context of that specificationdependency.py change reveal another place that needs to respect privacy?
[03:52] <StevenK> Unsure
[03:53] <wgrant> Also, have you confirmed that this actually fixes the blocking issue?
[03:54] <StevenK> I've confirmed it passes tests
[03:54] <StevenK> Shall I cowboy it onto mawson?
[03:55] <wgrant> If you can reproduce it on mawson today, that would indeed be a good idea
[03:55] <StevenK> Reproduce the problem?
[03:55] <wgrant> But the existing tests do not catch the blocking issue
[03:55] <wgrant> Yes
[04:04] <lifeless> 16:09 < ajmitch> heh
[04:04] <lifeless> *Bah* copy-paste fail.
[04:05] <ajmitch> quite

[04:50] <StevenK> I think I need to revert the change to make use of all_deps, rename dependencies to _dependencies, and write a method called dependencies that filters by visibility
[04:50] <wgrant> StevenK: Why not just make dependencies filter by visibility?
[04:51] <StevenK> 1) You need a user, and 2) dependencies is a SQLRelatedJoin
[04:51] <wgrant> Sure
[04:51] <wgrant> Does dependencies need to be an SQLRelatedJoin?
[04:52] <wgrant> Hm, but if it's an SQLRelatedJoin then it shouldn't recurse
[04:52] <wgrant> So how's it relevant?
[04:52] <StevenK> We don't want it to recurse for the dep tree
[04:52] <wgrant> Oh, does it only show immediate deps?
[04:52] <StevenK> That is exactly what is causing bug 1095235
[04:52] <_mup_> Bug #1095235: Bogus dependencies in Blueprint graph <lp-blueprints> <regression> <specifications> <Launchpad itself:Triaged> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1095235 >
[04:53] <StevenK> Yeah, dependencies and blocked are immeadiate children and parents
[04:53] <wgrant> Sure, but I thought the graph showed more than that
[04:53] <StevenK> r16333 changed the dep tree to use all_deps and all_blocked, which is the entire tree
[04:54] <StevenK> wgrant: It uses dependencies and blocked for each node
[04:54] <StevenK> spec-c all_blocked shows 'spec-a' and 'spec-b' since it's recursive
[04:54] <StevenK> spec-b all_blocked shows 'spec-a'
[04:54] <wgrant> StevenK: So it just uses the recursive query to grab all the nodes, and then queries them all anyway?
[04:55] <wgrant> If not, then what's the recursive query for in the first place?
[04:55] <StevenK> I'm not sure, but the deptree didn't used to use them
[06:05] <StevenK> OH
[06:05]  * StevenK finally figures out this traceback
