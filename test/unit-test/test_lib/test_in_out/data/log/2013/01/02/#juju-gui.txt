[13:16] <benji> two connections to the Canonical server don't work as well as one there and one here
=== teknico_ is now known as teknico
[15:16] <frankban> hi hazmat 
[15:22] <frankban> hazmat: the GUI debug server still tries to load external libraries from yui.yahooapis.com, I am making a card for that. Having https://jujucharms.com is great, but we have a problem: XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/juju-gui-17/json. Origin https://ec2-23-22-109-54.compute-1.amazonaws.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. I think we should allow all origins server side.
[15:27] <benji> Makyo teknico bac frankban goodspud bcsaller hazmat: call in 3 minutes?
[15:28] <frankban> benji: ok
[15:28] <bac> ok
[15:28] <teknico> benji, yep
[15:32] <bac> yo benji
[15:32] <benji> bac: G+ apparently doesn't like me today, one sec
[15:36] <bac> benji: you called this meeting...
[15:38] <bac> frankban: will you update LP for bug 1086822
[15:38] <_mup_> Bug #1086822: charm is very slow to start <juju-gui:Triaged> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086822 >
[15:38] <bac> link to branch, etc
[15:39] <frankban> bac: sure
[16:03] <hazmat> frankban, hmm
[16:04] <hazmat> frankban, so the link you gave isn't to a valid charm
[16:04] <hazmat> ie https://jujucharms.com/charms/precise/alice-irc-1/json
[16:04]  * hazmat checks the cors access
[16:06] <hazmat> frankban, it already allows for cors requests afaics
[16:07] <frankban> hazmat: aha! you are right, that's the link for Juju GUI. It works for other charms. Cool, so, only the debug server problem remains.
[16:08] <hazmat> frankban, that's not the link for juju gui.. the link for the gui is https://jujucharms.com/~juju-gui/precise/juju-gui/json
[16:08] <hazmat> the gui charm has never been through the charmers review queue for official inclusion
[16:09] <frankban> hazmat: that's the link GUI tries to load when you click on the "charms" tab of the Juju GUI service detail page. 
[16:10] <hazmat> interesting
[16:10] <hazmat> that's  sounds like a bug with local charms then
[16:14] <frankban> hazmat: filed bug 1095354
[16:14] <_mup_> Bug #1095354: When using local charms, the URL used to retrieve charm info is not correct <juju-gui:Triaged> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1095354 >
[16:54] <frankban> suddenly debug works, no errors, no changes :-/ bac: does your latest merged branch fix something about how the project is built?
[16:56] <goodspud> Has anybody played with the demo recently? It's a big buggy in places
[17:02] <teknico> do you mean a bit butty? OHWAIT
[17:03] <teknico> do we serve sandwiches via http? :-)
[17:09] <frankban> mi daresti una occhiata veloce a https://codereview.appspot.com/7026046 ?
[17:09] <frankban> osp
[17:09] <frankban> oops...
[17:10] <frankban> could someone please review https://codereview.appspot.com/7026046 ?
[17:11] <goodspud> teknico, can't go wrong with a bacon and sausage butty
[17:12] <teknico> goodspud, I don't eat meat, you insensitive clo(u)d ;-P
[17:12] <teknico> (usually)
[17:13] <goodspud> teknico: a tofu and asparagus butty then
[17:14] <goodspud> nom nom nom
[17:14] <teknico> that's more like it :-)
[17:16] <teknico> frankban, approved with thanks :-)
[17:17] <frankban> teknico: :-) cool
[17:22] <bac> frankban: i made a change at gary's request to project.json for the d3 specification.  perhaps that fixed it?
[17:23] <bac> goodspud: what do you see that is funny?
[17:25] <frankban> bac: hum... maybe
[17:27] <goodspud> bac. https://docs.google.com/a/canonical.com/file/d/0B1IM--9A1RkTbjFTUGwwR0lBeXc/edit
[17:27] <frankban> bac: could you please check if https://ec2-107-20-78-229.compute-1.amazonaws.com/ works well for you?
[17:29] <bac> frankban: the front page looks ok.  was slow to load.  anything particular i'm looking for?
[17:30] <bac> goodspud: where'd that yellow line come from?
[17:30] <frankban> bac: errors in the Javascript console?
[17:31] <bac> frankban: i saw some complaints about loading from http for fonts
[17:31] <goodspud> bac, that is a "pending" relation line that persists if you move either associated service
[17:32] <frankban> bac: cool, thank you
[19:41] <BradCrittenden> benji, benji: either of you having slow access to the data center today?
=== BradCrittenden is now known as bac
[19:41] <benji> bac: not that I have noticed.
[19:41] <benji> bac: I wonder if the inrush of traffic about the phone launch is gumming up the works
[19:42] <bac> maybe.  plus PR is having an inaugural celebration right now.  maybe all of those phone videos being pushed to FB is clogging our pipe
[20:46]  * bac -> dogwalk
[20:55] <benji> bac and hazmat: the login branch is ready for re-review (https://codereview.appspot.com/7007047)
[21:10] <hazmat> benji, cool, just sent some comments on replies to previous
[21:11] <benji> hazmat: thanks; looking
[21:11] <hazmat> benji, i think we should have a talk about this. i feel like there is a misunderstanding here
[21:13] <benji> hazmat: sure, let me read over your replies and think for a minute and then we'll get together
[21:13] <hazmat> benji, sounds good.. looking over the latest as well
[21:55] <hazmat> hmm.. had to go over wip limit .. the reliable test branch wasn't recorded in a lane
[22:08] <bcsaller> hazmat: I did a review of that but forgot to mention that you listed yeti as a dep but don't use it 
[22:11] <hazmat> bcsaller, gotcha
