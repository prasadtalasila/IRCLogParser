[05:27] <barrydk> Goodmorning everyone
[05:36] <mazal> Morning everyone
[05:40] <Kilos> morning all
[05:40] <Kilos> hi nlsthzn 
[05:40] <Kilos> nice to have you active again
[05:53] <Kilos> hi Squirm you yawning?
[05:53] <Kilos> dag mazal barrydk 
[05:53] <Kilos> yo Banlam bakuman 
[06:07] <magespawn> good morning
[06:07] <Kilos> hi magespawn 
[06:08] <magespawn> temp and humidity is up here, whats up there?
[06:08] <Kilos> still nice and coolish but sun starting to bake
[06:09] <Kilos> you over 30 today
[06:09] <magespawn> makes it a bit hard to work on pc's when when you dripping on everything
[06:09] <Kilos> yip
[06:09] <Kilos> get fans
[06:09] <Kilos> for that place big ones
[06:09] <magespawn> got fan and aircon
[06:09] <Kilos> ai
[06:10] <magespawn> it helps 
[06:11] <magespawn> especially if you do not move
[06:11] <Kilos> yeah
[06:13] <magespawn> kind of hard when you have to work lol
[06:13] <Kilos> hahaha
[06:13] <Kilos> i hope you saved all the ssh info that time
[06:14] <Kilos> looks like i gonna need help maybe later
[06:14] <Kilos> server can ssh here but not vice versa
[06:15] <magespawn> you can ssh from the server to the desktop but not the reverse?
[06:15] <Kilos> yip
[06:16] <Kilos> ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.2 port 22: No route to host
[06:16] <Kilos> i still gotta try a few commands i think 
[06:16] <Kilos> think ive sorted the conf thing
[06:29] <magespawn> that not route to host means that your pc cannot connect to the server
[06:29] <magespawn> check ip address, check firewalls
[06:30] <magespawn> see if you can ping it
[06:30] <Kilos> isnt that because the server was sshed first so it thinks this is the host now
[06:30] <Kilos> nope
[06:31] <mazal> brb , update reboot
[06:31] <Kilos> nope not either way today
[06:31] <Kilos> last night it could
[06:31] <Kilos> lemme see wassup
[06:32] <Kilos> actually i need to as well
[06:32] <Kilos> lotsa network manager updates today
[06:32] <Kilos> wbb
[06:32] <magespawn> k
[06:37] <superfly> afternoon all
[06:38] <barrydk> That time in the Cape superfly  Good morning
[06:44] <Kilos> hmm i moved the network card to make it easier to press the lock clip. maybe that pci socket not good
[06:44] <Kilos> grrr
[06:54] <magespawn> then it would not go either way
[06:54] <Kilos> it doesnt ping either way and last night pinged both ways
[06:54] <Kilos> sigh
[06:55] <Kilos> and i gotta do a few commands before they can ping. iptables stuff
[06:55] <magespawn> did you check the ip address
[06:56] <Kilos> they worked till i did a reinstall here when unity crashed member and have tried the server since
[06:57] <Kilos> havent
[06:57] <Kilos> hi Vince-0 
[06:57] <magespawn> ifconfig
[06:59] <Kilos> must that show something of the server too?
[07:01] <magespawn> no it show the ip addy of the machine that you are on
[07:01] <Vince-0> Hi Kilos !
[07:01] <Vince-0> and ubuntu-peeps
[07:01] <magespawn> so you need to check both
[07:01] <magespawn> hi Vince-0
[07:01] <inetpro> good morning

[07:02] <magespawn> hi inetpro
[07:02] <superfly> inetpro: really? I didn't notice... it's so hot and the sun is high in the sky

[07:03] <inetpro> Kilos: was it you who took a shot at Squirm?
[07:03] <inetpro> because it was not me

[07:05] <Kilos> hehe
[07:06] <Kilos> yay can ping server from here so far
[07:07] <Kilos> yay both ways
[07:07] <Kilos> hi jrgns 
[07:07] <jrgns> morning Kilos, all
[07:07] <Kilos> should one run ssh from the server first or from your desktop?
[07:09] <inetpro> Kilos: man ssh 
[07:09] <inetpro> and then
[07:09] <inetpro> man sshd
[07:10] <inetpro> or the other way around
[07:10] <Kilos> eeek
[07:11] <Kilos> instant headache
[07:11] <Kilos>  sshd [-46DdeiqTt] [-b bits] [-C connection_spec]
[07:11] <Kilos>           [-c host_certificate_file] [-f config_file] [-g login_grace_time]
[07:11] <Kilos>           [-h host_key_file] [-k key_gen_time] [-o option] [-p port] [-u len]
[07:11] <inetpro> Kilos: http://www.openssh.com/faq.html
[07:11] <Kilos> ty that might be in english
[07:11] <inetpro> Kilos: don't stop reading on the first few lines of a a man page
[07:12] <Kilos> ok i got to past first few
[07:12] <inetpro> those first few lines are what you typically need as a reminder once you know how to use things
[07:12] <inetpro> there's huge lot of detail
[07:17] <Kilos> yay i did sudo ssh from here and it did that fingerprint thing which it wouldnt do last night
[07:18] <Kilos> only did it from server last night
[07:18] <Kilos> and it shows miles@slowP4:~$ 
[07:18] <Kilos> so i can command that one now
[07:21] <Kilos> which machine is the client? the server?
[07:23] <magespawn> the client is the machine you ssh from so that depends
[07:24] <Kilos> oh
[07:24] <Kilos> so this be the client now then
[07:26] <Kilos> thanks guys
[07:27] <Kilos> was rattled there for a while
[07:28] <Kilos> i go sort sheep
[07:30] <magespawn> that statement, if taken out of context of Kilos, whould have most ppl asking for an explanation
[07:30] <magespawn> especially following on the heals of the last conversation about ssh
[07:35] <Kilos> what now?
[07:35] <magespawn> the whole 'i go sort sheep'
[07:36] <Kilos> rofl
[07:37] <magespawn> new comers be going "What?"
[07:40] <Kilos> hahaha
[07:42] <magespawn> todays task is get ie to tun in wine
[07:42] <magespawn> s/tun/run
[07:49] <Kilos> eek ie sucks
[07:56] <magespawn> yup but need it for this online course i am doing and wife has the other machine
[07:56] <Kilos> ai
[07:57] <magespawn> one of those things
[08:03] <Kilos> hi drussell all good?
[08:21] <Kilos> hi henkj 
[08:22] <henkj> hi Kilos 
[08:37] <inetpro> Kilos: don't do sudo ssh!
[08:38] <inetpro> that is so wrong!
[08:38] <Kilos> uh oh
[08:38] <Kilos> how do they then get to fingerprint each other
[08:38] <inetpro> why would you even want to do that?
[08:39] <Kilos> i dunno?
[08:39] <inetpro> ai!
[08:39] <Kilos> thought it was part os recognising each other
[08:39] <Kilos> of
[08:39] <Kilos> but i can go out again not so?
[08:39] <Kilos> and come back with ssh plain
[08:40] <inetpro> and where does sudo fit in there?
[08:40] <Kilos> or is it too late
[08:40] <Kilos> when i did ssh i saw no change in $
[08:40] <Kilos> prompt
[08:40] <inetpro> ai!
[08:40] <magespawn> just ssh username@ipaddress
[08:41] <Kilos> ok will do in future
[08:41] <Kilos> what damage have i now caused?
[08:42] <magespawn> probably nothing, but using sudo runs a command as root which if compromised could cause all sorts of hassels
[08:43] <magespawn> if i am not mistaken
[08:43] <Kilos> ah
[08:43] <Kilos> actually last time i did sudo as well first time then just ssh after
[08:44] <inetpro> Kilos: you need to understand what sudo does
[08:44] <magespawn> in your case you only ssh to your server but you can ssh to any machine in the world going through the internet which you do not want to sudo
[08:44] <inetpro> man sudo
[08:44] <Kilos> ok
[08:44] <Kilos> so the fingerprint is not necessary
[08:45] <inetpro> Kilos: has nothing to do with sudo
[08:45] <Kilos> oh ya when i went to your server i didnt use sudo
[08:46] <Kilos> oh would the fingerprint have come anyway or arent they needed
[08:46] <inetpro> Kilos: man ssh 
[08:46] <Kilos> ai
[08:46] <magespawn> lol
[08:46] <Kilos> sjoe
[08:47] <magespawn> the two of you with your 'ai'
[08:47] <Kilos> rofl
[08:49] <magespawn> long time since i have used wine = learning curve (again)
[08:56] <Kilos> ai every time i try install stuff on wine i make my pc sicker
[09:20] <Kilos> ai twice power went off for a bit and ups disconnected for repairs and investigtion
[09:20] <Kilos> im sure they switch it off and on to see if their circuit breakers still work
[09:21] <Kilos> swines
[09:21] <mazal> investigation , now that is a nice way of putting it :)
[09:22] <Kilos> hehe
[09:23] <barrydk> Don't worry electricity prise are going to double in the next 3 years and then the disruptions will also double up
[09:23] <Kilos> ai
[09:24] <Kilos> for a third world country these peeps steal like first world pros
[09:25] <magespawn> brb reboot
[09:25] <Kilos> k
[09:31] <magespawn> back
[09:31] <magespawn> not working here either
[09:42] <Squirm> Kilos: it's been hectic
[09:42] <Squirm> I hit the off button on 4 alarms this morning and fell asleep right after each one
[09:43] <Squirm> yes, I set 5 alarms in the morning to get me up
[09:44] <Kilos> wow
[09:44] <Kilos> you need a wife to kick you outa bed
[09:45] <Kilos> power gone there magespawn 
[09:45] <Kilos> ?

[09:48] <Kilos> lol
[09:48] <Kilos> hy leer tot laat
[09:49] <Kilos> hopelik
[09:49] <barrydk> ok might explain 
[10:23] <Kilos> yay ssh worked without the sudo this time
[10:54] <magespawn> no power was fine just mine laptop was unplugged
[10:54] <Kilos> ah
[10:56] <magespawn> i unplug the power to use the battery
[10:56] <magespawn> supposed to be better for the battery
[10:58] <henkj> magespawn: that's only true for older batteries
[10:58] <magespawn> yeah the lappy is about 6 years old
[10:58] <henkj> surprised the battery still holds much of a charge then
[10:59] <magespawn> about 2 hours
[10:59] <magespawn> but does not give any warning really when it goes off
[10:59] <magespawn> when you here the beeps you have to be plugging it in or it is gone
[11:00] <magespawn> but i was gifted this machine so i do not mind
[11:22] <mazal> I wonder how long mine would last , it's almost 7 years old now
[11:22] <mazal> The battery I mean , when plugging out the power
[11:34] <magespawn> brb going to get fish

[13:02] <inetpro> Kilos: no 
[13:02] <inetpro> we had good rains this season already
[13:02] <inetpro> was just lately that it became a bit dry
[13:03] <Kilos> when you have good rains everything grows inetpro and keeps groing
[13:03] <inetpro> lol
[13:03] <Kilos> good rains  are no good with droughts in between
[13:03] <Kilos> natal has good rains
[13:04] <Kilos> peeps gotta swim now and again
[13:08] <roryy> ello
[13:10] <Kilos> hi rorr
[13:10] <Kilos> oh my
[13:10] <Kilos> roryy, 
[13:10] <roryy> hey Kilos
[13:10] <roryy> how goes?
[13:11] <Kilos> good ty roryy and you?
[13:11] <roryy> not bad - on leave today and tomorrow
[13:11] <Kilos> nice
[14:37] <bebras> hello
[14:39] <Kilos> hi bebras 
[14:39] <Kilos> welcome to ubuntu-za
[14:39] <Kilos> lithuania
[14:39] <bebras> yes
[14:40] <Kilos> how did you end up here with us
[14:40] <Kilos> are you an ubuntu user?
[14:41] <Kilos> you are our first lithuania visitor
[14:42] <bebras> had experience with ubuntu
[14:43] <bebras> i am playing with raspberry pi but have different dist on that :)
[14:44] <Kilos> ah
[14:44] <Kilos> some of the guys here have them as well
[14:44] <bebras> pretty things
[14:48] <bebras> i am searching for areas where people have difficulties with internet connection
[14:49] <Kilos> have you got a cure for it?
[14:50] <Kilos> we have some problems here especially with mobile broadband and slow internet in general
[14:51] <bebras> to be more specific, I want to solve problem: help people  to check email, but have no/limited/slow internet 
[14:51] <Kilos> ah
[14:53] <bebras> mine solution: send sms text message as soon as important email comes to the inbox
[14:53] <Kilos> ah 
[14:54] <magespawn> nice idea
[14:54] <Kilos> smses are expensive in south africa unless one gets sms bundles from the service providers
[14:55] <magespawn> you could use something google sms to do it
[14:55] <magespawn> then it could come straight from the person own inbox
[14:55] <Kilos> oh ya but it doesnt work all over magespawn 
[14:56] <bebras> yes, i read that google provide this service in limited list of countries
[14:56] <magespawn> true if you could work a way to get selected emails delivered vis sms/mms that would be awesome
[14:56] <bebras> i haven't tried it
[14:57] <bebras> if you are interested: http://bebrapp.appspot.com/
[14:58] <bebras> it is free beta
[14:58] <jrgns> trello sends smses in SA, at almost decent prices
[14:59] <jrgns> it should be trivial to setup a ifttt.com recipe to sms certain mails to yourself
[14:59] <bebras> trello itself sends sms? or 3rd part solution?
[14:59] <jrgns> trello is an api to send smses and make voice calls
[15:00] <jrgns> soz, not trello. wtf. brainfart
[15:00] <jrgns> twillio
[15:00] <jrgns> http://www.twilio.com/
[15:02] <Kilos> i go get sheep
[15:02] <bebras> lost connection :/
[15:03] <jrgns> i've got to hit the road.. cheers guys
[15:04] <bebras> jrgns: yes, also zapier.com works in a very similar way as ifttt.com and provides free functionality i think
[15:05] <magespawn> bebras what language are you using to write the program?
[15:06] <bebras> python
[15:06] <bebras> and for web platform it is google app engine
[15:06] <magespawn> cool there are some python programmers here i am busy learning that myself
[15:07] <bebras> thats nice :)
[15:07] <magespawn> some of the guys have a lot of experience
[15:07] <magespawn> gotta go home time here, later all\
[15:08] <bebras> ok, latter
[16:02] <inetpro> I would be very hesitant to provide my cellnumber to third parties 
[16:02] <inetpro> but that's just me
[16:03] <Kilos> yeah airtime disappears sometimes
[17:18] <Kilos> yo Cantide stiff from can cycle?
[17:18] <Cantide> nah :p

[19:16] <Kilos> answer that at least
[19:16] <inetpro> maybe
[19:16] <Kilos> you forget i forget
[19:16] <inetpro> nee
