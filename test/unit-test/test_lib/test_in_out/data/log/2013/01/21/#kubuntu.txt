[01:00] <Kagmar> My USB Mice are intermittently working. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I have a forum thread on ubuntuforums.org but I have not got a reply from anyone in 3 days, when I started the thread.
[01:10] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: hi
[01:24] <Kagmar> hi
[01:58] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: is the mice working properly now?
[01:59] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: use my nick name
[01:59] <Kagmar> at the moment yes. but it doesn't always work.
[01:59] <Kagmar> what do you mean use your nick name
[02:14] <phoenix_firebrd> press the letter p and press tab button and my nick name will get auto completed when you message here. I fou use my nick i will get alert in my desktop and i can answer you faster
[02:14] <phoenix_firebrd> press the letter p and press tab button and my nick name will get auto completed when you message here. If you use my nick i will get alert in my desktop and i can answer you faster
[02:17] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: ^
[02:17] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: ok
[02:17] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: nice
[02:18] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: is your mouse a new one?
[02:18] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: yes
[02:19] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: when does it not work?
[02:20] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: at random, I will be doing something when it suddenly stops working and I switch to the PS2 mouse and it works.
[02:21] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: while it was not working I tried 3 USB mice, one PS2 mouse, and the USB mice in a PS2 adapter and only the crappiest of the USB mice worked in the PS2 adapter.
[02:21] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: so when it stops, does the keyboad work? and also the operating system?
[02:22] <Kagmar> The keyboard works, but is PS2
[02:22] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: and so does the os
[02:23] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: so I don't know if keyboards stop working... I do know that usb storage work when the mice don't.
[02:24] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: so as far as I know, its just the USB mice.
[02:24] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: how frequently this happen?
[02:25] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: My USB mouse hasn't acted up in the past 10-12 hrs... but it generally works for a day or so then stops working for 2 or 3 more days.
[02:27] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: I have seen a similar problems in most debian system's bug sites.
[02:28] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: do you have any other linux installations of different versions or in worst case any other operating system?
[02:30] <Kagmar> I used to have windows and Backtrack 5r4 (I think) before my harddrive took a dump, but now I only have Kubuntu 12.10
[02:31] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: not used to needing to use the nicks
[02:31] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: ok
[02:31] <phoenix_firebrd> Kagmar: Can you confirm that the mice's hardware is not the problem?
[02:32] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: yes, it was the same with 3 USB mice and it worked fine in both backtrack and windows before I formatted my hdd.
[02:34] <Kagmar> phoenix_firebrd: Also I have not had problems with PS2 mice.

[09:55] <theadmin> Hello everyone. I have a problem with sound in Kubuntu - a while after logging in, it dissapears. According to advice I got from BluesKaj yesterday, I added "options snd-hda-intel index=0" to my /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf, but that did not help. The audio device is "Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SBx00 Azalia (Intel HDA) (rev 40)" and the Phonon backend in use is gstreamer.

[10:22] <chr1st0ph> Hello, from time to time I get a SSL auth error popup message for api.opendesktop.org on my KDE Plasma-Desktop.
[10:22] <chr1st0ph> Any idea what wants to connect to the opendesktop api and how to get rid of is?
[10:26] <tsimpson> chr1st0ph: it should be from System Settings -> Account Details -> Social Desktop
[10:29] <chr1st0ph> tsimpson: thx
[10:52] <theadmin> Hello everyone. I have a problem -- sound dissapears a while after logging in. Nothing but a reboot helps. I added "options snd-hda-intel index=0" to /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf and pcm.!default { type plug slave.pcm { type hw card 0 device 0 } } to /etc/asound.conf. Neither helped. The phonon backend in use is gstreamer. Pulseaudio is present, but removing it does not solve the problem.
[10:53] <theadmin> I'll be right back.
[11:18] <theadmin> Ok, I'm back. If anything, can "lib32asound2" being installed be the problem? Was a dependency of TeamViewer, and removing TeamViewer (and disconnecting my phone) helped. Now I'm not sure which one was the problem.
[11:20] <sbivol> theadmin: I have teamviewer 8, Kubuntu 12.10 and ATI HDMI sound. had no problems at all
[11:21] <theadmin_> sbivol: Hm, okay, then it must be my phone being connected as "media device".
[11:21] <theadmin_> Though I'm on Precise, but the teamviewer package is universal.
[11:21] <sbivol> theadmin_: shouldn't. Media device probably refers only to the fact that it's a media player
[11:23] <theadmin_> sbivol: Odd. Well, anyway, I beleive the problem is solved. I hope so, at least. I'll try reinstalling teamviewer later... Cause I do need it.
[11:24] <theadmin_> Never mind... The problem is still there :/ Sound disappeared again.

[11:31] <theadmin> Hm, no sound in TTYs either. It seems that this isn't KDE-specific, I shall move this to #ubuntu

[23:06] <hhhzzzain> what is the default package installer in kubuntu? I can not find it.
[23:06] <hhhzzzain> I had it last night but now its gone.
[23:07] <hhhzzzain> What is the application manager in kubuntu 12.10 called?
[23:13] <hhhzzzain> I am missing my package application installer manager in kubuntu, how do I install it again?
[23:14] <hhhzzzain> I mean to say, how could have happened to it? I did not perform any console commands to remove it.
[23:17] <OerHeks> odd, muon shouldn't be removed, sudo apt-get install muon should bring it back
[23:17] <BarkingFish> evening guys - anyone know where do-release-upgrade falls wrt packages and what provides it please?
[23:18] <BarkingFish> i'm still trying to get up to testing raring ringtail, and do-release-upgrade is broken
[23:19] <hhhzzzain> muon was removed
[23:19] <hhhzzzain> so was the kpackagekit
[23:20] <BarkingFish> kpackagekit went in the move to 11.10, i used to use it - i didn't realize muon had gone too.

[23:21] <shadeslayer> BarkingFish: could you explain a bit more?
[23:21] <BarkingFish> ignore me, i'm getting confused.
[23:22] <BarkingFish> it wasn't kpackagekit that went between 1104 and 1110, it was kpackage, apper's predecessor

[23:26] <hhhzzzain> thank you
[23:27] <hhhzzzain> shadeslayer, is muon installed by default on kubuntu 12.10?
[23:27] <hhhzzzain> or just apper?
[23:27] <shadeslayer> should be
[23:27] <hhhzzzain> Last nigh I had apper.
[23:27] <shadeslayer> apper was dropped for reasons I don't remeber
[23:27] <shadeslayer> I see
[23:27] <hhhzzzain> today it was removed somehow
[23:28] <shadeslayer> check /var/log/apt/history.log
[23:28] <hhhzzzain> apper is still default in 12.10
[23:28] <shadeslayer> no
[23:28] <hhhzzzain> really?
[23:28] <hhhzzzain> I had it last night?
[23:28] <shadeslayer> we ship muon for the last couple of releases
[23:28] <shadeslayer> maybe you installed it?
[23:28] <shadeslayer> separately
[23:28] <hhhzzzain> no ...
[23:28] <BarkingFish> i still have apper
[23:28] <BarkingFish> :)
[23:28] <shadeslayer> :)
[23:28] <hhhzzzain> am I dreaming?
[23:28] <shadeslayer> did you upgrade
[23:28] <shadeslayer> or do a clean install
[23:29] <hhhzzzain> I just installed kubuntu 12.10 yesterday
[23:29] <hhhzzzain> fresh
[23:29] <shadeslayer> 0.o
[23:29] <hhhzzzain> I am not familiar with kde packages.
[23:29] <shadeslayer> sec
[23:29] <shadeslayer> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/12.10/release/kubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.manifest
[23:29] <shadeslayer> no mention of apper ^
[23:30] <hhhzzzain> i have 32 bit
[23:30] <shadeslayer> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/12.10/release/kubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.manifest
[23:30] <shadeslayer> same thing
[23:30] <shadeslayer> so it's impossible for you to have apper unless you explicitly didn't install it
[23:30] <hhhzzzain> I did not.
[23:31] <hhhzzzain> because muon interace looks much differnt, more like apt manager
[23:31] <shadeslayer> can you pastebin your /var/log/apt/history.log
[23:31] <hhhzzzain> ok
[23:31] <shadeslayer> I can tell you exactly what pulled in apper then
[23:34] <hhhzzzain> shadeslayer: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1556986/
[23:35] <shadeslayer> hmm
[23:35] <shadeslayer> odd
[23:35] <shadeslayer> Install: plasma-active-mobilecomponents:i386 (2.0+git2012071701-0ubuntu1, automatic), kalarm:i386 (4.9.4-0ubuntu0.1), share-like-connect-data:i386 (2.0+git2012021101-0ubuntu1, automatic), plasma-active-metadatamodels:i386 (2.0+git2012071701-0ubuntu1, automatic), libqtwebkit-qmlwebkitplugin:i386 (2.2.1-4ubuntu1, automatic), share-like-connect:i386 (2.0+git2012021101-0ubuntu1, automatic), plasma-active-data:i386 (2.0+git2012071701-0ubuntu1,

[23:35] <FloodBotK1> shadeslayer: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[23:36] <shadeslayer> doing that removes muon
[23:36] <shadeslayer> can someone else reproduce?
[23:37] <hhhzzzain> what should I be looking at there?
[23:38] <hhhzzzain> hmm.
[23:38] <hhhzzzain> I can do it again to see if it removes it?

[23:44] <hhhzzzain> gui interface.
[23:45] <hhhzzzain> it was more like ubuntu software center since the icons for applications was showing.
