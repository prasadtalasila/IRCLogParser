[18:32] <KlfJoat> Does anyone care to look at bug 1102797 for me and make sure I did it right?  It's my first time, so please be gentle.  <grins>
[18:32] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1102797 in sane-backends (Ubuntu) "Fujitsu ScanSnap S1500 does not work after fresh install of 12.10 x64" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1102797
[18:47] <penguin42> KlfJoat: Seems reasonable
[18:48] <penguin42> KlfJoat: Did you try installing libsane-extras?
[18:56] <KlfJoat> Already installed
[18:57] <KlfJoat> ...  oh, I spoke too soon.  I didn't install it, but my scanner is in the mainline libsane.
[19:02] <penguin42> KlfJoat: I don't know much about sane to ask anything else except asking if there is any debug you can get out of it
[19:14] <KlfJoat> That's fine.  :-)  I just want to make sure I didn't do it wrong or anything.  I've never filed a bug on Launchpad before.
[19:45] <penguin42> KlfJoat: Did you file that using ubuntu-bug ?
[21:02] <KlfJoat> Yeah, I think so...
[21:05] <penguin42> ok
[21:05] <KlfJoat> It's been a couple of days.  :-)
[21:06] <penguin42> there are a LOT of bugs in there - so frankly it's unlikely to get fixed quickly unless the sane guys spot it; I'd ask on a sane channel/list as well
[21:07] <KlfJoat> Well, I was also wondering if I even assigned it to the right package.
[21:07] <penguin42> yeh I think that's reasonable
[21:08] <KlfJoat> The Wiki says that any hardware issues should be assigned to the kernel ("linux").  But it shows up in UDEV, so I figure the kernel is seeing it...
[21:09] <KlfJoat> But sane-find-scanner doesn't see it....
[21:09] <KlfJoat> Or, rather, throws those errors.
[21:10] <penguin42> yeh I'd agree with you on this one, unless it's dependent on some special kernel driver that I doubt
[21:13] <KlfJoat> but, then again, there are those weird messages in dmesg about microframes (from libusb, I'm assuming)...
[21:13] <KlfJoat> So now do you see where I might be a bit confused?  <grins>
[21:14] <penguin42> haha ok now you admit to the weird dmesg errors!
[21:15] <penguin42> KlfJoat: Now do you want to attach those to the bug?
[21:15] <TheLordOfTime> you know, this is what irks me about that in the wiki: it doesn't specify how to actually determine *if* its a hardware problem... which makes this situation a case-in-point for why the wiki should be expanded on such things... :P
[21:16] <KlfJoat> penguin42:  I put them in the body of the bug report. :-P
[21:17] <KlfJoat> TheLordOfTime: Nods
[21:17] <penguin42> KlfJoat: Ah not seen one of those before, doesn't look too serious
[21:18] <KlfJoat> I agree.  It's not dumping core...  but the scanner isn't working anymore.
[21:18] <KlfJoat> Another question is whether this is a 64-bit issue.
[21:19] <KlfJoat> If I'd known this was going to happen, I'd have only changed one thing at a time.  :-P
[21:23] <penguin42> haha that's difficult to know
[21:23] <penguin42> KlfJoat: you might be able to install the 32 bit sane stuff - try installing the package with :i386 at the end, might break too many things though
[21:24] <KlfJoat> penguin42: Tried that.  a) didn't change anything and b) I'm not familiar with multiarch enough to be sure I was running the 32-bit version of sane-find-scanner.
[21:24] <KlfJoat> to clarify, a) It didn't fix the problem nor did it change the behavior.
[21:24] <TheLordOfTime> sudo apt-get remove sane-find-scanner; sudo apt-get install sane-find-scanner:i386 ?
[21:25] <TheLordOfTime> ... ooops low power
[21:25]  * TheLordOfTime disappears to find a power outlet
[21:25] <penguin42> TheLordOfTime: Pedal faster!
[21:25] <penguin42> KlfJoat: I'd ask the sane guys
[21:27]  * KlfJoat sighs.  "Okay, I'll get to it some time next week."
[21:27] <penguin42> KlfJoat: You could try force installing the sane packages from 12.04 - it might break stuff though
[21:30] <KlfJoat> Yeah...  I'd like to keep from trashing my system.  :-)
[21:30] <KlfJoat> I've got lots of stuff piling up to scan, so I pulled out the Win7 HDD that came with my laptop and I'm running the official software.
[21:31] <KlfJoat> Curse whoever caused this to happen!  They've made me use Windows! :-P
[21:33] <penguin42> still, it's better than bug 83957 (yuch!)
