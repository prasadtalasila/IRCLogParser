[04:22] <snap-l> http://podcast.cbc.ca/mp3/podcasts/vinylcafe_20110108_41153.mp3 rick_h_: This one, 30:00 in is the one I was really thinking of. Listen to this one first, if you will.
[12:06] <snap-l> Good morning
[12:31] <rick_h_> morning
[13:43] <snap-l> rick_h_: Did you listen to those clips I posted?
[13:44] <rick_h_> snap-l: no, not yet.
[13:44] <snap-l> no worries. Just wanted to make sure you got them
[13:45] <snap-l> The rest of the episodes are pretty much a miss for me (folk music == ugh) but the Dave and Morley stories are hilarious.
[14:19] <snap-l> Funny enough, I got a note from Coderwall today.
[14:19] <snap-l> I must've subscribed to some newsletter.
[14:20] <rick_h_> hah, login after 1000 days of inactivity and emails resume
[14:26] <snap-l> ust be
[14:27] <rick_h_> I got the same thing
[14:30] <snap-l> What a PITA
[16:17] <snap-l> What is unity-scope-video-remote, and why does it keep bothering me with errors? :)
[16:18] <greg-g> snap-l: don't ask questions you don't want answers to.
[16:18] <jcastro> I think that's the remote videos thing
[16:18] <jcastro> like youtube, etc.
[16:19] <snap-l> greg-g: That's just my passive aggressive way of asking for it not to crash all the time. ;)
[16:19] <snap-l> I figure it was reading my keypresses.
[16:23] <greg-g> snap-l: exactly ;)
[18:14] <brousch> The Holy Grail http://mobile.slashdot.org/story/13/01/10/1513251/plasma-active-sailfish-and-ubuntu-phone-developers-discussing-common-apis
[18:30] <snap-l> Yes, I'm sure many died trying to find the ever elusive API.
[18:30] <snap-l> brousch: ^
[18:31] <snap-l> The Knights Templar protect the API.
[18:47] <dzho> many bothans died to bring us this API
