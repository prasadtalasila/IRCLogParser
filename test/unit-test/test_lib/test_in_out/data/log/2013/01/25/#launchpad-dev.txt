[00:01] <StevenK> requirements.txt:# Non-standard dependencies
[00:01] <StevenK> wgrant: ^
[00:02] <wgrant> StevenK: great
[00:02] <StevenK> Now I just need the webservice test to pass
[00:05] <StevenK> ValueError: No value for required parameter 'user'
[00:05] <StevenK> But it uses @call_with! Which is the whole point!
[00:06] <wgrant> StevenK: What does the definition in the interface look like?
[00:07] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1567621/
[00:07] <wgrant> StevenK: operation_parameters shouldn't be there, I don't think
[00:08] <StevenK> Oh, that might be fighting with call_with?
[00:08] <wgrant> Yes
[00:08] <wgrant> operation_parameters specifies the parameters for the operation
[00:08] <wgrant> Not necessarily the method
[00:08] <StevenK> Ah
[00:09] <StevenK> I thought you needed both. :-(
[00:10] <cjwatson> I've pre-QAed r16450 on mawson this time, by way of a cowboy.  If it seems plausible to roll it out over the UK night, that would be cool.
[00:10] <cjwatson> QueueInconsistentStateError: cjwatson QA bodge: refusing upload to copy archive
[00:11] <cjwatson> 2013-01-25 00:07:48 DEBUG   Building recipients list.
[00:11] <cjwatson> 2013-01-25 00:07:48 DEBUG   No recipients on email, not sending.
[00:11] <cjwatson> (I couldn't get the actual QueueInconsistentStateError seen in the previous instances of this bug to happen on mawson.  I'm not sure whether it's gone away or I just wasn't trying hard enough.)
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:12] <wgrant> cjwatson: It might rely on the binary never making it into the primary archive
[00:12] <wgrant> So there were no overrides to inherit
[00:13] <cjwatson> Well, except it was in the primary archive on production ...
[00:14] <cjwatson>        lha | 1.14i-10.4 | quantal/multiverse | source, amd64, armel, armhf, i386, powerpc
[00:14] <cjwatson> Though it was removed from raring; I suppose that might matter
[00:14] <cjwatson> Ah yes, the removal hadn't happened yet on dogfood
[00:14] <cjwatson> I'll try that next time :)
[00:14] <cjwatson> That would certainly explain a lot
[00:15] <wgrant> Yeah, that'd be why it hasn't been noticed much before
[00:19] <cjwatson> Indeed, all the other upload failures on http://people.ubuntuwire.org/~wgrant/rebuild-ftbfs-test/test-rebuild-20121221-raring.html were ones I removed in the same process-removals run on 2013-01-08
[00:20] <wgrant> cjwatson: Great
[00:21] <cjwatson> Good call
[00:24] <wgrant> cjwatson, StevenK: Any objections to updating qastaging's DB over the weekend?
[00:24] <wgrant> Will take qas down for about a day
[00:25] <cjwatson> I'll be on leave and don't care
[00:25] <cjwatson> I mean, physically away
[00:25] <wgrant> Aha
[00:27] <StevenK> It's what, 11 months out of date?
[00:28] <wgrant> April, I think
[00:28] <wgrant> So not quite
[00:29] <StevenK> wgrant: However, no objections.
[00:46] <plomme> hey wgrant. I know you're very busy so no pressure, I just wanted to know how far back you recon bug 1100164 would be pushed
[00:46] <_mup_> Bug #1100164: Private projects are forbidden from having releases when only files are problematic <privacy> <private-projects> <releases> <Launchpad itself:Triaged> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100164 >
[00:48] <wgrant> plomme: I will hopefully be working on that this afternoon
[00:48] <wgrant> it's a small fix.
[00:48] <wgrant> I'd hope to work on it on Mon/Tue, but a lot of production issues have come up this week, sorry :(
[00:48] <wgrant> hoped
[00:48] <plomme> ok great thanks a lot =)
[00:49] <plomme> yeah I know how that goes haha
[00:49] <wgrant> Everything likes to fall apart at once :)
[00:51] <plomme> yeah tell me about it. I've had a manic week as well. Issues never come alone
[01:14] <StevenK> wgrant: https://blueprints.dogfood.launchpad.net/production-auditor/+spec/spec-c
[01:14] <StevenK> wgrant: What do you see, if anything for the Dependency tree ?
[01:25] <wgrant> StevenK: c → b → a
[01:32] <StevenK> Hm, then you have access to B
[01:35] <StevenK> wgrant: I thought I had removed you from seeing B, though :-(
[01:38] <wgrant> StevenK: :(
[01:38] <wgrant> I might be god at the moment
[01:38] <wgrant> Though blueprints don't respect godpowers, do they...
[01:38] <StevenK> Nope
[01:39] <StevenK> I removed your APG on production-auditor
[01:39] <wgrant> I can see B
[01:39] <wgrant> But maybe that's because I'm an admin
[01:39] <wgrant> Can I list B...
[01:39] <wgrant> \Yes
[01:40] <wgrant> StevenK: ~canonical has an APG
[01:41] <StevenK> Ah ha
[01:41] <wgrant> "permissions": {"PROPRIETARY": "ALL"}}
[01:42] <StevenK> wgrant: ~canonical's APG is kaput, has B disappeared?
[01:43] <wgrant> I AM BLIND
[01:43] <wgrant> a and b are no longer on the graph
[01:43] <StevenK> Right, that's what I expected
[01:44] <StevenK> And it fixes danilos' Critical
[01:50]  * StevenK marks r16450 as qa-ok
[01:56] <danilos> StevenK, woohoo, cheers (though I am not here ;)
[01:56] <StevenK> danilos: Haha! :-)
[01:56] <wgrant> StevenK: Methods named 'dependencies' and 'blocked_specs' aren't a thing
[01:57] <StevenK> Can't make them properties ...
[01:57] <wgrant> Also, you uncached a few things -- deliberate?
[01:57] <wgrant> StevenK: Sure
[01:57] <wgrant> You can rename them :)
[01:57] <StevenK> Bleh, I meant to revert back to cachedproperty
[01:57] <wgrant> At the moment they look exactly like properties
[01:57] <wgrant> Very confusing
[01:58] <StevenK> wgrant: What would you suggest?
[01:58] <wgrant> getDependencies, or something like that
[01:58] <wgrant> Methods are verbs
[02:00] <wgrant> StevenK: Hm, to retain webservice compatibility I guess you could leave dependencies as an unfiltered SQLRelatedJoin
[02:00] <wgrant> lazr.restful will automatically filter out invisible things
[02:00] <wgrant> (although the count will be wrong)
[02:00] <wgrant> Not sure which is worse
[02:02] <StevenK> Hmmm, neither
[02:06] <lifeless> its all worse
[02:51] <StevenK> lifeless: Thanks for your support. :-P

[07:13] <StevenK> wgrant: ^ Can that make use of the can_have_release_files that the other template uses?
[07:13] <wgrant> StevenK: Sadly not, since that's an attribute on ProductRelease
[07:13] <wgrant> I could move it to product, but meeeeh
[07:13] <StevenK> That is my only niggle, r=me
[07:14] <wgrant> Thanks

[17:59] <gmb> benji, Do you think you'll get a chance to take a peek at https://code.launchpad.net/~gmb/lp2kanban/encode-annotations-with-json/+merge/144372 today, or is that too much to ask for?
[18:00] <gmb> Ooh, that sounded a bit bitchy.
[18:00] <gmb> What I meant was "or have you got too much on your plate?"
[18:00] <gmb> Sorry benji :)
[18:01] <benji> gmb: heh; sure, I can look at it in just a moment
[18:06] <gmb> benji, Thanks :)
[18:48] <benji> gmb: review done; looks great; I thought it might be nice to allow multi-line JSON so I sketched out some code to enable that
[18:49] <gmb> benji, awesome, thanks.
