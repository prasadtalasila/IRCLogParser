[17:49] <locodir-user> hi everybody...
[17:49] <locodir-user> there's a problem in my server
[18:13] <JanC> czajkowski: http://www.mivb.be/DiscoverBrussels.html?l=en
[18:13] <JanC> those are valid in all bus, tram & metro from MIVB/STIB
[18:17] <JanC> even from/to the airport apparently
[18:22] <JanC> hm, apparently you need to buy a "MOBIB" card for that (5â‚¬, but reusable next times you come to Brussels)
[18:24] <JanC> well, the 72h ticket might be available as an "old style" magnetic ticket still
[18:52] <czajkowski> thanks
