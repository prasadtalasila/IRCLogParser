[02:42] <k1l> wonderlessgirl_: first of all you need  to watch your language
[02:43] <wonderlessgirl_> of course im pissed
[02:43] <k1l> calling names is not appropriate no matter what is wrong with your ubuntu
[02:43] <wonderlessgirl_> yous keep saying ubuntu is great and such, but you cant help me to get mine working
[02:44] <wonderlessgirl_> all  you guys do is make me do something over and over, i said its not the usb or image
[02:44] <k1l> if you cant stick to the rules in the ubuntu channels you are not allowed to enter and to get support in that. if you cant stop calling names i dont see a point in unban you
[02:44] <wonderlessgirl_> someone made me check 3 days ago
[02:44] <wonderlessgirl_> so why you would keep telling me voer and over that its the usbs fault is fucking beyond me
