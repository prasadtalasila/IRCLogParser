[11:06] <riply> Hi guys, anyone I can talk to here about a little abuse of power? @ikonia muted me and I'd like to appeal it? http://pastebin.com/jh1W3Gpf
[11:07] <riply> This was in the #ubuntu channel
[11:17] <tsimpson> riply: calling windows "winblows" is not helpful to anyone and only fosters a bad atmosphere, everyone is entitled to their opinions but #ubuntu is strictly for support related talk only. using disrespectful names only serves to make the Ubuntu community look hostile to users of other OSes and that's not something we want in our channels
[11:18] <tsimpson> riply: having said that if you are willing to not use such derogatory terms for other OSes, even windows, I'd be happy to remove the quiet
[11:38] <tsimpson> riply: please come back when you are not AFK
[13:43] <ubottu> In #ubuntu-offtopic, dwatkins said: !no, pi is either 3, for small values of pi, approximately 3.14159265359 or about 22/7.

[14:04] <IdleOne> ah ok. and you are ok with following the !guidelines?

[14:05] <riply> I understand you're trying to create harmony
[14:05] <riply> it doesn't look like either of them are online, however
[14:06] <IdleOne> ok, gimme just a  minute here and I will remove the mute
[14:07] <IdleOne> are you able to send messages to #ubuntu now?
[14:08] <IdleOne> riply: ?

[14:09] <riply> IdleOne, it is still saying I'm silenced
[14:09] <riply> IdleOne, it seems we have success!
