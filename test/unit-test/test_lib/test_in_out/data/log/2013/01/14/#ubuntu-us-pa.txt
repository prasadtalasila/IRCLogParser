[00:55] <Samuraialba> Good bacon to all!
[02:10] <InHisName> You're a good egg, Samuraialba
[03:11] <roasted> :D
[03:12] <roasted> JonathanD: yes - are you not familiar with subsonic?
[03:12] <JonathanD> I am not.
[03:12] <roasted> JonathanD: I put my entire music library on my server... now I just stream music to all of my other systems from that server.
[03:12] <roasted> If you donate a few bucks you can get an unlocked key for the android app too
[03:12] <roasted> so I can stream over 4g
[03:12] <JonathanD> ah.
[03:12] <roasted> which, I did, but due to data I try to keep that from happening too much
[03:13] <roasted> unless it's one of those days I just have that burning desire for that ozzy song
[03:13] <roasted> that I don't have on my local phone
[03:13] <roasted> whenever we have people over and we're outside on the deck I hook up my phone or tablet to external speakers and will stream from the server on the LAN. Super convenient.
