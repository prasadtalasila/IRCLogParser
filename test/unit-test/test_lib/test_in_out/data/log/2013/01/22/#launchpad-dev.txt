[01:24]  * StevenK stabs specification filtering
[01:25] <StevenK> Two methods use SpecificationFilter.{ACCEPTED,PROPOSED,DECLINED} for utterly different things
[01:28] <wgrant> :)
[01:28] <wgrant> Series and sprints?
[01:28] <StevenK> Yeah
[01:28] <StevenK> The sprint stuff doesn't use search_specifications(), it's just too wacky
[01:29] <StevenK> Back down to one failure
[01:30] <wgrant> :)
[01:56] <wgrant> StevenK: https://code.launchpad.net/~wgrant/launchpad/handleStatus-refactor-2/+merge/144203
[02:43] <StevenK> wgrant: r=me, perhaps you could run update-copyright. I'm a little concerned about the BUILDERFAIL method now, you just reset the BQ record, and merrily go on your way.
[02:44] <wgrant> StevenK: The thing is that BQ.reset already sets the status to NEEDSBUILD
[02:44] <wgrant> But I think BUILDERFAIL is the case that causes some of the broken builds we occasionally see
[02:44] <wgrant> So it probably already doesn't work for some reason anyway :/
[02:44] <wgrant> It'll all be reworked when BFJO dies soonish
[03:13] <StevenK> wgrant: Right
[03:37] <StevenK> wgrant: I've been staring at this failure for too long. Can haz help?
[03:37] <wgrant> StevenK: Sure
[03:38] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1557408/ is the diff (It's -r submit:, so should include everything)
[03:39] <StevenK> wgrant: lp.registry.tests.test_person.TestSpecifications.test_in_progress is the failing test, which is failing since the query is returning both the STARTED and IMPLEMENTED specs
[03:44] <wgrant> StevenK: Looking
[03:52] <wgrant> StevenK: Look around line 1170 of the diff
[03:52] <wgrant> in_progress was previously handled inside a "COMPLETE not in filter" guard
[03:53] <wgrant> Which also added an INCOMPLETE filter
[03:55] <StevenK> Bah, and that fixes it
[03:55] <StevenK> Adding INCOMPLETE to the block was probably the kicker
[03:55] <wgrant> Yeah
[03:55] <wgrant> Is it really worth having a separate in_progress flag on the underlying method?
[03:55] <wgrant> Should Person.specifications just map it to (STARTED, INCOMPLETE)?
[03:56] <StevenK> I can drag that bit back to Person.specifications
[03:58] <wgrant> It doesn't seem valuable to have that flag on the underlying infrastructure
[03:58] <wgrant> Given only a single method exposes it
[04:04]  * StevenK refactors the second if default_acceptance block out
[05:12] <StevenK> wgrant: https://code.launchpad.net/~stevenk/launchpad/use-specification-aag/+merge/143630 updated
[05:14] <wgrant> StevenK: That's quite a diff
[05:14] <wgrant> I may be a while
[05:14] <StevenK> Haha
[05:15] <StevenK> wgrant: Do you want a rope around the waist so you don't get lost? :-)
[05:15] <wgrant> Can you do the neck instead?
[05:15] <StevenK> Haha
[05:21] <wgrant> StevenK: Are Milestone and Sprint likely to be portable?
[05:23] <StevenK> wgrant: I've run out of steam
[05:23] <wgrant> Sure.
[05:24] <StevenK> Milestone.getSpecifications() is nothing like anything else, and wants people too
[05:24] <StevenK> So that's a bit difficult
[05:24] <wgrant> StevenK: For in_progress, I was hoping you could just add INCOMPLETE and STARTED to the filter.
[05:25] <wgrant> Although I'm not sure if those filters are meant to be unioned or intersected.
[05:25] <StevenK> Oh, spec_filter.extend([INCOMPLETE, STARTED]) and get_specification_filters adds get_specification_started_clause ?
[05:25] <StevenK> Those filters are a mess
[05:25] <wgrant> Depends if they intersect or union
[05:26] <wgrant> But I was hoping to keep all those workflow filters in one place
[05:28] <StevenK> AttributeError: type object 'SpecificationFilter' has no attribute 'STARTED'
[05:29] <StevenK> No clean up for you
[05:29] <wgrant> StevenK: Sure, it probably doesn't exist already
[05:29] <wgrant> But that doesn't mean it shouldn't.
[05:32] <StevenK> wgrant: Right, so that's been abstracted back into search_specifications
[05:32] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1557550/
[05:35] <wgrant> StevenK: I think you double-join product a couple of times, don't you?
[05:35] <wgrant> As search_specifications includes the Product.active filter
[05:36] <StevenK> wgrant: Which callsites do you suspect do so?
[05:36] <wgrant> StevenK: ProjectGroup.specifications
[05:36] <wgrant> Though it doesn't rejoin Product, it does duplicate Product.active
[05:37] <StevenK> wgrant: Right, dropped
[05:42] <wgrant> StevenK: At the top of search_specifications, can you explicitly put both default/options sets in a branch?
[05:43] <wgrant> ie. if not default_acceptance: default = ...; options = ...; else: default = ...; options = ...
[05:43] <wgrant> It's very difficult to understand now
[05:44] <wgrant> Also, that for option in options thing looks like someone reinvented set intersection
[05:46] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1557566/
[05:47] <wgrant> StevenK: The series targets had a different interpretation of SpecificationSort.DATE, too
[05:47] <wgrant> StevenK: After adding STARTED was a perfect place to commit :)
[05:50]  * StevenK reads the SpecificationSort.DATE code in distroseries and groans
[05:50] <wgrant> StevenK: Also, does get_specification_privacy_filter want an admin shortcircuit like I think the others do?
[05:50] <StevenK> get_branch_privacy_filter has no admin shortcut
[05:51] <wgrant> Indeed
[05:51] <wgrant> Probably OK, then
[05:52] <wgrant> StevenK: Does _preload_specifications_people still need the SQL() bit now that most callsites are ported?
[05:53] <wgrant> Also, is that deliberately avoiding getPrecachedPersonsByID?
[05:54] <StevenK> wgrant: I have *no* idea about that code
[05:54] <StevenK> I touched it once, and the world broke, so I left well enough alone
[05:54] <StevenK> Right, I get the series change for DATE
[06:00] <StevenK> wgrant: STARTED code seperated out and commited, http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1557578/ is remaining
[06:02] <wgrant> StevenK: Don'y youy need the PROPOSED/ALL filter in the sorting bit?
[06:03] <StevenK> I was ignoring that bit, since it acts the same
[06:03] <wgrant> It's a change in behaviour
[06:03] <wgrant> Previously if I asked for ALL or PROPOSED from a distroseries it'd order by datecreated
[06:03] <wgrant> Now it will order by date_goal_decided
[06:04] <StevenK> Bah
[06:04] <StevenK> I misread date_completed as datecreated
[06:08] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1557587/
[06:10] <wgrant> StevenK: Isn't that show_proposed check inverted?
[06:10] <wgrant> Also, you use .intersection there but & in the previous hunk
[06:10] <wgrant> In fact, I'd merge the show_proposed into the else
[06:11] <wgrant> so 'if default_acceptance and not (show_proposed & spec_filter):"
[06:12] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1557595/
[06:14] <wgrant> StevenK: Looks reasonable
[06:24] <StevenK> wgrant: Diff on the MP updated
[06:27] <stub> $ bzr branch lp:ubuntu/postgresql-9.1

[06:27] <stub> Anyone know if that means my repo is screwed, or if the lp branch is screwed?
[06:28] <wgrant> StevenK: The LP branch
[06:28] <wgrant> Er, stub
[06:38] <StevenK> wgrant: Still looking?
[06:41] <wgrant> StevenK: r=me with a comment
[06:41]  * StevenK has fear
[06:55] <wgrant> StevenK: https://code.launchpad.net/~wgrant/launchpad/bfjo-shrink/+merge/144227
[06:57] <StevenK> wgrant: The first paragraph of the description almost requires a diagram.
[06:57] <wgrant> Quit.er
[06:57] <wgrant> Quite.
[06:58] <StevenK> However, r=me
[06:58] <wgrant> Thankyou sir
[06:58] <wgrant> Is your spec branch going through EC2?
[06:59] <StevenK> No, I'm playing buildbot bingo
[06:59] <wgrant> Aw
[06:59] <wgrant> I was hoping for a 10 commit streak.
[06:59] <StevenK> I've ran -m registry -m blueprints enough
[07:00] <StevenK> So BFJO is dead. But only sort of, since you rename another class to its name
[07:00] <wgrant> Well
[07:00] <wgrant> BFJOD delegated to BFJO
[07:00] <wgrant> And everything inherited BFJOD
[07:00] <wgrant> But BFJO didn't do anything
[07:00] <wgrant> So I merged them
[07:02] <wgrant> And the new class is not terribly long for this world.
[07:40] <StevenK> Holy crap. I won buildbot bingo.
[07:40] <wgrant> Impressive
[07:40] <wgrant> I guess the blueprint tests are crap :)
[07:40] <lifeless> is bingo a false ok
[07:40] <lifeless> or an ok ok
[07:42] <StevenK> lifeless: An ok ok
[07:43] <StevenK> IE, toss the branch at buildbot and see if it passes, since it's so much faster than ec2
[07:54] <lifeless> cunning plan
[08:20] <stub> Anyone know where the button to create a new sourcepackage recipe lives?
[08:21] <wgrant> stub: On the branch page
[08:21] <wgrant> It's not there for private branches, as recipes don't support private branches.
[08:23] <stub> found it. not my branch so first step is working out where it was :)
[08:45] <StevenK> wgrant: You lose buildbot bingo
[08:46] <wgrant> I'm well aware :)
[08:56] <czajkowski> morning
[08:57] <lifeless> wait, what?
[08:59] <czajkowski> lifeless: Goood morning
[09:00] <lifeless> czajkowski: ;) good morning
[09:00] <czajkowski> nothing good about snow mister nothing!
[09:00]  * czajkowski cries at her inbox 
[09:00] <czajkowski> it was all nice and tidy yesterday
[09:01] <lifeless> czajkowski: heh
[09:02] <czajkowski> how's the little one doing?
[09:02] <lifeless> brilliantly
[09:03] <adeuring> good morning
[09:03] <lifeless> she was wandering around with my t-shirt on as an over-shirt this evening
[09:03] <lifeless> cutest thing ever
[09:05] <czajkowski> awww
[09:05] <czajkowski> lifeless: is the heat bothering her at all ?
[09:07] <lifeless> czajkowski: heat?
[09:09] <czajkowski> you're in AU aren't you?
[09:14] <lifeless> nope
[09:14] <lifeless> NZ
[09:14] <lifeless> AU == boiling heat, why I left there 2.5 years ago :)
[09:14] <czajkowski> ahh
[09:14] <czajkowski> now makes more sense
[09:15] <czajkowski> I'll swap boiling for -8 and poxy snow!
[09:15] <lifeless> much easier to warm up than cool down
[09:16] <czajkowski> I like cjwatson and lifeless bugs, they can never be invalid or rarely a duplicate.
[09:16]  * lifeless aims to please
[09:16] <czajkowski> after this mornings lot of mails it makes me happy
