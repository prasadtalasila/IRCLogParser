=== slank is now known as slank_away
[03:20] <Logomachist> Hi
[03:22] <Logomachist> I was trying to install from source on Windows but it wasn't going very well so I gave up and used the standalone installer.
[03:22] <Logomachist> Was my orginal goal ill-advised?

[13:52] <spacecowboy29> A question , when trying to fetch a branch I get this error http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589248/
[13:52] <spacecowboy29> corkscrew is referred to as corksrew, so I guess a typo, but I don't know where I should correct it...
[13:53] <mgz> spacecowboy29: looks like you've got some borked config
[13:54] <mgz> try `ssh -vv YOURLPNAME@bazaar.launchpad.net` and get that working first
[13:55] <spacecowboy29> Ah, same error http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589664/
[13:56] <spacecowboy29> Would fiddling around with bazaar.conf help ?
[13:56] <mgz> no, it's ssh that's borked, not bzr
[13:56] <mgz> you were meant to substitute the bit in CAPS though :)
[13:57] <spacecowboy29> holy...
[13:57] <mgz> and you don't need the `` when running
[13:57] <spacecowboy29> Ah I feel like an idiot...sorry
[13:57] <mgz> spacecowboy29: basically, you need to fix your ~/.ssh/config
[13:58] <mgz> you have a proxy command that's using a tool you don't have installed
[13:59] <mgz> well, it's tyoped at any rate, but you probably don't want it
[14:00] <spacecowboy29> I corrected the typo from "corksrew" to "corkscrew" an error though, I've installed corkscrew though
[14:00] <spacecowboy29> Should I nuke the cofig file ?
[14:00] <spacecowboy29> Here's the config file http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589680/
[14:01] <mgz> just remove that, if you don't actually need to ssh via that?
[14:03] <spacecowboy29> I'm under a HTTP proxy, so I probably need it ?
[14:04] <spacecowboy29> The typo error is removed but it still shows a few errors http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589690/  Are my keys bad ?
[14:04] <mgz> perhaps, you'll need to `man corkscrew` and figure out the right configuration if you really do need it
[14:05] <mgz> spacecowboy29: nope, it's not getting as far as key exchange, you can't open a connection of any kind
[14:06] <mgz> I suggest reading up on tunnelling ssh over http, it's probably non-trivial and may require more than you can actually use
[14:06] <spacecowboy29> Ah, I see, thanks a ton ! Will have to check out, thanks again !
[14:06] <mgz> note, you don't need ssh for read-only access to launchpad, just to push branches yourself
[14:07] <mgz> rmoving your launchpad_username from bazaar.conf and ignoring the message that tells you it's not set makes bzr use http for lp: urls
[14:08] <spacecowboy29> I see, I think my ip lets only http and https connections, so maybe thats the problem
[14:10] <mgz> it seems like corkscrew might work, but you probably want to follow a guide on that and see if you can actually ssh to anywhere once you're set up
[14:10] <spacecowboy29> Removing it seems to work, so I guess I need to configure corkscrew for it, thanks again  !

[23:31] <mwhudson> what's the api equivalent of 'bzr branch'?  sprout?
[23:39] <spiv> mwhudson: IIRC, yes, depending on the level you're operating at.
[23:40] <spiv> I *think* there's a convenience method that's more closely like the 'bzr branch' command somewhere too.
[23:43] <xnox> most of the time you want branch_or_dir thing (whatever is it's proper name)
[23:46] <mwhudson> xnox: i'm not sure that counts as a helpful comment :-)
[23:47] <xnox> mwhudson: =)))) it's midnight here and I'm chatting =) how you doing btw? =)))))
