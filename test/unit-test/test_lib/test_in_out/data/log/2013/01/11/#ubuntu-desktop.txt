[07:31] <didrocks> salut jibel!
[07:34] <jibel> Salut didrocks , comment ça va ?
[07:34] <jibel> getting closer from a daily release of unity ? ;)
[07:34] <didrocks> jibel: ça va bien!
[07:35] <didrocks> jibel: UTAH seemed to not being nice on intel (stuck), so relaunched it
[07:35] <didrocks> with a latest unity commit
[07:35] <didrocks> then, relaunching the indicator-only tests
[07:35] <didrocks> libdbusmenu failed, so I would like to not release it
[07:35] <didrocks> (just rm the files in the directory to not consider it)
[07:35] <didrocks> but it seems the caps are again vanished
[07:36] <jibel> didrocks, tell me if it hangs again on intel, I'll have a look.
[07:36] <didrocks> jibel: thanks! do you mind giving me back to caps?
[07:42] <jibel> didrocks, doen
[07:42] <jibel> done
[07:42] <didrocks> jibel: rocking! Thanks :)
[07:43] <didrocks> (and working ;))
[07:55] <jibel> didrocks, I fixed the weird umask in r194, you'll have to republish the jobs to make it effective
[07:56] <didrocks> jibel: ok, let's do that after this release :)

[10:19] <didrocks> hey chrisccoulson
[10:20] <chrisccoulson> hi didrocks, how are you?
[10:20] <didrocks> I'm good, thanks, yourself?
[10:20] <chrisccoulson> didrocks, yeah, not too bad thanks. still tired though ;)
[10:21] <chrisccoulson> added some more test cases to firefox yesterday to hopefully avoid language pack bugs in the future :)
[10:21] <chrisccoulson> that should please seb128 ;)

[10:30] <seb128> chrisccoulson, excellent
[10:31] <chrisccoulson> language packs get very little testing upstream, because they're not the primary way for most of their users to get a localized firefox
[10:31] <chrisccoulson> which means we're quite exposed, hence the recent issues
[10:31] <chrisccoulson> hopefully we can prevent that in future though :)
[10:32] <seb128> yeah, hopefully upstream still agrees to help supporting the usecase ;-)
[10:56] <pitti> seb128, didrocks: does any of you go to FOSDEM?

[10:57] <pitti> ack
[10:57] <pitti> just wondering whether to share a room, etc.
[10:57] <pitti> anyone else going to FOSDEM?

[11:09] <Laney> hmm, i wanted to go

[11:13] <xnox> Laney: there is never a reasonably priced eurostar =)
[11:14] <Laney> seems that way
[11:14] <Laney> i've not been on it :(
[11:26] <xnox> I was =) but my previous employer paid for it :P
[11:27] <Laney> aren't you like 15 and therefore can get young persons rate anyway?
[11:27] <Laney> :P
[11:30] <chrisccoulson> hmmm, i wish webgl didn't suck so badly in firefox
[11:54] <xnox> Laney: funny you should say that. Just a few days ago I attached my 16-25 railcard onto my oyster to get cap limit discounts on oyster network.
[11:54] <Laney> xnox: Mine runs out very soon :(
[11:54] <Laney> renewed it the day before my 26th birthday
[11:56] <xnox> cheat.
[11:57] <Laney> you should purchase a three year one the day before your 24th birthday
[11:57] <xnox> I didn't know I could get a three year one.
[11:58] <Laney> me neither (until it was too late)
[11:58] <xnox> well it is too late for me.
[11:58] <Laney> unlucky
[11:58] <xnox> plus you need a british passport to buy online.
[11:59] <Laney> also a secret I found out is that the person that renews it in person can do it for 13 months
[11:59] <Laney> so if you ask nicely you can get an extra month when you're 27

[16:41] <Laney> :P
[16:43] <Laney> can't tell if it's something apps should be fixing or a fix in glib/gtk+ is required
[16:44] <Laney> suppose the latter
[16:48] <seb128> Laney, let's wait for desrt to be around to comment
[16:48] <seb128> uploading a new glib on friday seems like not a great idea anyway
[16:48] <Laney> heh
[16:50] <Laney> it's in svn anyway, so not much more work when we figure out what to do

[17:19] <didrocks> but maybe, it was just a dream involving you, larsu and seb128 :)
[17:19] <larsu> HAHA
[17:19] <desrt> huh weird.  i must have had a strange problem with my IRC client
[17:19] <desrt> i wonder what happened
[17:19] <larsu> desrt, you missed the best part: <didrocks> but maybe, it was just a dream involving you, larsu and seb128 :)
[17:19] <didrocks> desrt: ahah, nice try!
[17:19] <desrt> didrocks has dreams about me?
[17:19] <desrt> and lars and seb are in them?
[17:20] <didrocks> scary isn't it? :)
[17:20] <desrt> i'm not scared
[17:20] <desrt> but i think maybe you work too much :p
[17:20] <didrocks> heh
[17:20] <seb128> oh, desrt is there
[17:20] <seb128> he's just not responding when you mention bugs :p
[17:20] <seb128> desrt, you can't hide again!
[17:20] <seb128> desrt, hey btw ;-)
[17:21] <didrocks> seb128: this is his """""IRC issues"""" :)
[17:21] <seb128> yeah
[17:21] <desrt> didrocks: your unbalanced quote marks are really bothering me
[17:21] <desrt> please try not to do that again
[17:21] <didrocks> seb128: see, it's """"happening again"""" when you mention bugs :)
[17:21] <seb128> desrt, any recommendation what we should do for glib 2.25 and that segfault on close bug?
[17:21] <desrt> seb128: ya... that's an interesting one
[17:21] <didrocks> desrt: they were perfectly balanced, those are your network issues ;)
[17:22] <didrocks> (hem hem)
[17:22] <desrt> seb128: fwiw, i don't think it's a glib bug
[17:22] <desrt> but that's little help for you
[17:22] <seb128> desrt, well, it's blocking glib to be updated in any case
[17:23] <seb128> desrt, I guess it's a "somebody needs to debug further to know what's going on"?
[17:23] <seb128> e.g no recommendation/solution until then?
[17:23] <desrt> you could back out the change
[17:25] <seb128> desrt, well, options are to back out the change or to stay on 2.24 until that's resolved one way or another ... I'm not in an hurry to update so I guess we could wait a few days to see where that goes
[17:26] <desrt> seb128: i'd kill for a testcase
[17:27] <desrt> problem is that nobody has seen it outside of uimanager
[17:27] <desrt> and uimanager is gigantic and ugly
[17:27] <didrocks> seb128: don't give him a testcase, he will become a murderer then!
[17:27] <didrocks> we still need him :)
[17:39] <robru> didrocks, ping
[17:39] <didrocks> hey robru :)
[17:39] <robru> didrocks, so about https://code.launchpad.net/~robru/signon-ui/autoland/+merge/142761
[17:39] <robru> didrocks, kenvandine and I weren't sure how to know what number to put as the revision
[17:39] <didrocks> yeah?
[17:39] <didrocks> robru: so, basically, there are two cases
[17:40] <robru> didrocks, we were looking at libunity-webapps and the revision number was 100's less than what the latest commit was, and there didn't seem to be much of a reason for how that commit was chosen (the chosen commit didn't look special at all)
[17:40] <didrocks> the first one is, there are been no release since the inlining
[17:40] <didrocks> robru: didn't I change it? I remember to have screwed libunity-webapps by 100 :)
[17:40] <seb128> mterry, hey
[17:40] <robru> didrocks, I guess so. it's mysterious to me.
[17:41] <robru> didrocks, I'm also unsure how to tell which revision is the most recent one that's been released in-distro
[17:41] <didrocks> - if there has been no release since the inline, the rev number is the one from the inlining
[17:41] <didrocks>   + we have to list every bugs fixed since the last release to the inlining
[17:41] <seb128> mterry, unity-greeter still states "ubuntu 12.10" on raring ... do you know if anyone asked design for an updated logo? (it would be good if we could generate that image dynamically...)
[17:41] <didrocks> - if there are been a release since the inline, the revision number is just the revision number of the release
[17:42] <didrocks> robru: you normally have either a tag or a commit with "release <foo>"
[17:42] <didrocks> for any good upstream project :)
[17:42] <robru> didrocks, so in the case of signon-ui, the inlining commit is literally the most recent one. so there's been no release since inlining.
[17:42] <didrocks> robru: are the 2 cases I stated above makes senese? ^
[17:43] <robru> didrocks, yeah, I understand what you're saying now
[17:43] <didrocks> robru: yeah, it's rev 71, isn't it?
[17:43] <mterry> seb128, we have a bug open about it... let me see
[17:43] <seb128> mterry, who is providing the image usually?
[17:43] <didrocks> robru: and there has been no bug fixed from the latest rev to rev 71, so nothing to list in addition to this commit :)
[17:43] <seb128> mterry, direct ping my be needed ;-)
[17:43] <robru> didrocks, oh, right. I was looking at the debian/changelog, not the bzr commit log
[17:43] <mterry> seb128, bug 1083333
[17:43] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1083333 in unity-greeter (Ubuntu) "Need greeter 13.04 logo asset" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1083333
[17:44] <mterry> seb128, rose is usually.  she gave us a 13.04 one, but it wasn't good
[17:44] <didrocks> robru: yeah, mostly bzr commits will be of help :)
[17:44] <seb128> mterry, ok, well no hurry I was just wondering if that's something that would need some pinging, thanks
[17:45] <robru> didrocks, ok, so I'll change it to 71, and then what? do I list commits 72 and 73 in the debian/changelog?
[17:45] <didrocks> robru: just an example of libdbusmenu which had bugs fixed between the latest release and the inlining version: https://code.launchpad.net/~didrocks/libdbusmenu/bootstrap2/+merge/142446
[17:46] <didrocks> robru: no, you don't need, as you specify rev 71, the bot will start to grab all the bugs fixed from rev 72 and onward :)
[17:46] <didrocks> and then you won't need for it all
[17:46] <didrocks> but let's say the rev 68 was the latest release
[17:46] <robru> ahh, ok
[17:46] <didrocks> bugs were fixed in rev 69 and 70
[17:47] <didrocks> as you state rev 71 as the "beginning to look at", it will never look at rev 69 and 70
[17:47] <didrocks> and so those bugs won't ever be listed in debian/changelog
[17:47] <robru> ok
[17:47] <didrocks> robru: this is only for the boostrapping, if we listed rev 68, it would take every bugs from the inlining in debian/changelog that appears in rev 71
[17:48] <didrocks> so relisting every bugs :)
[17:48] <robru> didrocks, ok, I think I understand now. I wasn't sure what was the significance of this revno that we needed to list.
[17:49] <didrocks> robru: yeah, I tried to explain it a little bit in the wiki, please feel free to clear that up if you feel the need :)
[17:49] <didrocks> again, it's only the bootstrap, so we can forget after a while… :)

[17:50] <sarnold> didrocks: nohup? :)
[17:51] <didrocks> sarnold: yeah, I should do that, but normally too late once you run "unity" :)
[17:51] <bschaefer> didrocks, haha, yeah, I have mine running sometimes when Im building/testing so I can restart unity
[17:51] <bschaefer> on the same terminal as I compile :)
[17:51] <didrocks> heh :)
[17:51] <robru> didrocks, ok, please approve now ;-) https://code.launchpad.net/~robru/signon-ui/autoland/+merge/142761
[17:52] <didrocks> robru: done! there was another one IIRC :)
[17:52] <robru> didrocks, yes, I am just looking at that one now ;-)
[17:52] <didrocks> but this was this morning, so maybe my memory is wrong, it was stone age! :)
[17:52] <sarnold> didrocks: oh, if you need it, there's a 'disown' bash builtin that does some of it after the fact
[17:53] <didrocks> sarnold: oh? I didn't know about that one, will look at it, thanks!
[17:59] <robru> didrocks, ok, this one should be good now too. https://code.launchpad.net/~robru/webaccounts-browser-extension/autoland/+merge/142769 ;-)
