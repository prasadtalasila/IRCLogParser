[00:00] <Slart> i386? they still compile for that? I thought everything was at least 586 by now

[00:00] <Slart> escott: ah.. thanks.. my faith in a proper world order is restored =)
[00:01] <OmnipotentEntity> riderplus, I don't have a /var/log/messages, did you want /var/log/syslog instead?
[00:01] <SonikkuAmerica> escott: I just got done retrofitting a Gateway 500 SE for Lubuntu 12.10
[00:01] <OmnipotentEntity> or dmesg?
[00:01] <SonikkuAmerica> and Slart: ^^
[00:02] <SonikkuAmerica> (Wow I hate typing the 1st name that comes to mind)
[00:02] <riderplus> yes /var/log/syslog and dmesg then
[00:02] <OmnipotentEntity> I don't seem to have fpaste either, what package is that in?
[00:02] <riderplus> sorry it was for fedora
[00:02] <riderplus> i forgot i'm on ubuntu
[00:02] <riderplus> :)
[00:02] <riderplus> go to pastebin.com and paste it there
[00:02] <OmnipotentEntity> I'll just paste bin it ;)  here's my /etc/network/interfaces:

[00:04] <riderplus> OmnipotentEntity do you use networkmanager or wicd?
[00:05] <OmnipotentEntity> networkmanager I believe
[00:05] <OmnipotentEntity> I def don't use wicd
[00:07] <riderplus> why are you struggling with ipv6 do you really need it?
[00:07] <OmnipotentEntity> I'm unaware of my doing anything special to get ipv6, my ISP doesn't support it
[00:08] <Ben64> i'm wondering more about br0
[00:08] <OmnipotentEntity> I have this computer set up to act as a wifi access point.
[00:08] <OmnipotentEntity> It's working, but
[00:08] <OmnipotentEntity> it's not something that will come back after a reboot
[00:09] <OmnipotentEntity> which is why I'm fighting networking
[00:09] <Ben64> what?
[00:10] <ryan_turner> I have a new external harddrive that i just formatted using Disks in Ubuntu 12.10. It's formatted to FAT. I have it mounted, and when I try to access it to create/delete/transfer files etc, I get the error "The destination is read only"
[00:11] <riderplus> ryan_turner permission issues
[00:11] <ryan_turner> How do I resolve this permissions issue?
[00:11] <bwong> riderplus yeah its a 64bit...
[00:11] <bwong> riderplus i dont know why its looking for i386 normal.mod...
[00:11] <LarrySteeze> out of curiousity, anyone here attending scale?
[00:11] <riderplus> !chmod | ryan_turner
[00:11] <ubottu> ryan_turner: An explanation of what file permissions are and how they can be manipulated can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
[00:12] <Ben64> riderplus: that won't work on fat
[00:12] <ryan_turner> riderplus, , I understand file permissions roughtly.
[00:12] <thec4ke>   OmnipotentEntity: does /etc/default/hostapd have RUN_DAEMON set to yes?
[00:12] <ryan_turner> I tried to chmod 077 /media/$me/$drive_name
[00:12] <ryan_turner> no errors, just didnt fix the problem.
[00:12] <ryan_turner> 0777*
[00:12] <Ben64> ryan_turner: chmod doesn't work on fat, do you need it as fat?
[00:12] <OmnipotentEntity> thec4ke, no, not yet.
[00:12] <riderplus> did you also chown -R youruser:youruser /mnt/yourdisk ??
[00:13] <thec4ke> you need to set that to yes to have hostapd started at every boot
[00:13] <escott> ryan_turner, ignore what riderplus is telling you. your disk is FAT it has no permissions
[00:13] <OmnipotentEntity> so just RUN_DAEMON=yes?
[00:13] <thec4ke> yes
[00:13] <bwong> ouch
[00:13] <ryan_turner> Ben64, escott, Im trying to use this as a 2tb external drive to transfer music between ubuntu desktop and mac laptop.
[00:13] <blkadder> ryan_turner: Perhaps it is mounted read only?
[00:13] <escott> ryan_turner, what is the output of "mount"
[00:13] <ryan_turner> NTFS a better options?
[00:13] <OmnipotentEntity> rebooting and seeing if it comes back all nice like
[00:14] <escott> ryan_turner, NTFS is non-POSIX so it has no Linux permissions
[00:14] <francesco_> riderplus: I made the usb, but still when I boot the laptop the usb blinks a few seconda and then I come to Grub rescue
[00:14] <bwong> cant solve this problem please help if available : http://askubuntu.com/questions/169600/fix-grub2-after-installing-ubuntu-12-04
[00:14] <Ben64> ryan_turner: if mac works with ext4 i'd use that, otherwise fat32 is the best for compatibility.
[00:14] <ryan_turner> Output of "mount": http://pastebin.com/smQsDNGj
[00:14] <AN7> does anyone know how to install ubuntu on a rooted android tablet?
[00:14] <ryan_turner> "Relliott" is the drive Im trying to use.
[00:15] <ryan_turner> Ben64, yeah osx does no ext2/3/4
[00:15] <blkadder> vfat...
[00:15] <escott> ryan_turner, the user named "ryan_turner" should be able to write to the folder /media/ryan_turner/Relliott. what is the output of "touch /media/ryan_turner/Relliott/test"
[00:15] <Ben64> ryan_turner: how did you mount it? it should have auto mounted
[00:16] <escott> bwong, boot is 386 mode. it doesn't enter long mode until the kernel starts
[00:16] <escott> bwong, unless you are using efi64 (which you arent)
[00:16] <ryan_turner> Ben64, I formatted it from NTFS to FAT using Disks. It auto mounted after that.
[00:17] <Ben64> ryan_turner: try unmounting it, unplugging it, and plugging it back in
[00:17] <ryan_turner> escott, nada. Just an empty line (aka it worked?)
[00:17] <riderplus> escott about permissions http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/miscellaneous/53527-cant-change-permissions-mounted-fat32-partition.html
[00:17] <escott> ryan_turner, yes it was successful
[00:17] <ryan_turner> And now there is
[00:17] <ryan_turner> -rw-r--r--  1 ryan_turner ryan_turner     0 Jan 16 18:17 test
[00:17] <ryan_turner> so, wth
[00:17] <riderplus> escott it's called "faking permissions"
[00:18] <ryan_turner> but back in the browser (nautilus is it?) I still cant make a directory, for instance
[00:18] <ryan_turner> or make a new doc
[00:18] <Ben64> riderplus: mount options are different than trying to chmod an already mounted fat32 system
[00:18] <escott> riderplus, you instructed him to chmod. there are no permissions to modify
[00:19] <riderplus> escott I didn't notice it was FAT
[00:19] <Ben64> ryan_turner: but you can see the file you just touched from nautilus?
[00:19] <escott> riderplus, the kernel maintains a single static unchangeable umask and owner for the mountpoint and all inodes in the mountpoint
[00:19] <riderplus> that link is helpful though
[00:19] <ryan_turner> Ben64, yes it is now there.
[00:19] <magn3ts> How do I get to the *Actual* network configuration panel instead of what All Settings -> Network gives me?
[00:19] <magn3ts> Since it's broken and miserable and useless
[00:19] <escott> riderplus, its not meant to be critical. i just saw its and cut him off before he went down the wrong path
[00:20] <bwong> solutions? anybody.
[00:20] <Ben64> ryan_turner: what if you right click the test file, and try editing it?
[00:20] <riderplus> escott yes my fault didn't see FAT
[00:20] <escott> bwong, sounds like your grub modules are not where they should be.
[00:20] <escott> bwong, reinstall grub?
[00:20] <ryan_turner> Ben64, opened it gedit, modified, and saved without error.
[00:21] <ryan_turner> Ben64, verified that it took the changes too.
[00:21] <Ben64> ryan_turner: ... then if you try to right click and create a new folder or something?
=== mike is now known as Guest51251
[00:21] <escott> ryan_turner, if you use another username that is not ryan_turner that user may be unable to modify the disk when ryan_turner was the one who opened it
[00:21] <ryan_turner> Error while copying to "Relliott". The destination is read only.
[00:22] <ryan_turner> escott, I have no other profiles on this computer
[00:22] <Ben64> i still think it's weird that it's mounted as vfat as opposed to fuse
[00:22] <Ben64> my fat32 external drives all come up as fuse
[00:22] <ryan_turner> Ben64, I've not been able to get any of my SD media to work either.
[00:22] <escott> Ben64, vfat is correct and normal? why would it be fuse
[00:22] <Ben64> escott: /dev/sdd1 on /media/94201C92201C7D84 type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,allow_other,default_permissions,blksize=4096)
[00:22] <riderplus> someone edited the /etc/fstab with /dev/sdaX /windows/RW vfat rw,fat=32,umask=000,noexec,quiet 1 1
[00:22] <riderplus> and it worked
[00:22] <ryan_turner> I generally haven't been able to get nautilus to let me edit mounted stuff recently.
[00:23] <escott> Ben64, fuseblk is common for NTFS. is that NTFS or fat?
[00:23] <riderplus> where /windows/RW is the mount point
[00:23] <Ben64> i thought it was fat32....
[00:23] <riderplus> and /dev/sdX is the device
[00:23] <escott> Ben64, there is no reason to use a fuse driver for fat. its in kernel. for exfat or ntfs you might have a fuse driver
[00:23] <Ben64> /dev/sdd1   *          63     8027789     4013863+   7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT \\\\ my mistake, i must have changed it to ntfs at some point
[00:24] <escott> ryan_turner, what does "ps aux | grep nautilus" say
[00:24] <ryan_turner> I just did a sudo nautilus in terminal and launched it, of course there are no issues using nautilus under root. Any idea why nautilus is not getting the write or delete perm?
[00:24] <riderplus> ryan_turner try to edit /etc/fstab as I told you
[00:24] <escott> ryan_turner, (a) never sudo a gui program, (b) don't sudo nautilus, (c) thats probably what is going on
[00:24] <ryan_turner> escott, http://pastebin.com/ADunDrz9
[00:25] <escott> !gksudo | ryan_turner
[00:25] <ubottu> ryan_turner: If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[00:25] <riderplus> identify your device, choose a mountpoint and use those mount options
[00:25] <Ben64> why is nautilus running as "1000"
[00:25] <escott> ryan_turner, why is ps aux not printing your username?
[00:25] <blkadder> You have other issues ryan_turner...
[00:25] <ryan_turner> escott, I have no idea.
[00:25] <escott> ryan_turner, can you paste the contents of /etc/passwd please
[00:25] <ryan_turner> blkadder, point me in a direction :)
[00:26] <blkadder> UID to username mapping for one. :-)
[00:26] <Ben64> yeah definitely uid related problem
[00:26] <ryan_turner> Here's my passwd, escott: http://pastebin.com/6QTtCb0A
[00:26] <ryan_turner> e
[00:26] <ryan_turner> err 1000
[00:27] <Ben64> hmm
[00:27] <escott> ryan_turner, 1000 is the correct uid and matches the mount options for the fat disk, but ps should resolve 1000 to ryan_turner
[00:27] <blkadder> >8 char?
[00:27] <escott> ryan_turner, something is going on if it prints the numeric
[00:27] <ryan_turner> hrm
[00:28] <escott> blkadder, perhaps. ryan_turner can you ps aux and see if other usernames (namely root) are printed in the first column
=== |Nordom| is now known as Nordom
[00:28] <ryan_turner> Ah
[00:28] <blkadder> Shouldn't be an issue but just thinking...
[00:28] <ryan_turner> "if it can be obtained and the field width permits"
[00:28] <ryan_turner> aka my username may be too long for ps to display it.
[00:29] <blkadder> Well do you see other names?
[00:29] <ryan_turner> root
[00:29] <ryan_turner> nobody
[00:29] <ryan_turner> yes :)
[00:29] <blkadder> Ok that's good.
[00:30] <ryan_turner> Errr
[00:30] <ryan_turner> ok
[00:30] <ryan_turner> I can delete files
[00:30] <ryan_turner> I just deleted the test file in nautilus
[00:30] <ryan_turner> but I cant create files or paste files in.
[00:30] <blkadder> But you can from the command line?
[00:31] <ryan_turner> yes.
[00:31] <riderplus> then it's nautilus

[00:33] <ryan_turner> damn
[00:33] <ryan_turner> This may or may not be related?
[00:33] <jrib> ryan_turner: press "reload" in nautilus
[00:33] <ryan_turner> about a week ago I rebooted
[00:33] <ryan_turner> display was all whacky
[00:33] <Gerowen> I have a desktop PC that I share with my wife. We have an external hard drive that is formatted in EXT4, and I created a user group that contains both of our usernames and has full permissions to the external drive. The problem is that if I log in first she is unable to browse the drive because even though she has permissions to the it, it gets automatically mounted in /media/marcus/Storage , which only my user account has permi
[00:33] <Gerowen> ssion to view.  Is there a way to change the default mounting location of removable devices from /media/username to just /media?
[00:33] <ryan_turner> and no USB would work once it hit the login screen
[00:33] <ryan_turner> power was still there, but none of the ports were resonsive anymore
[00:33] <escott> ryan_turner, likely  something else
[00:33] <ryan_turner> Did recovery, ended up running off an older kernel
[00:34] <ryan_turner> that resolved the problem
[00:34] <ryan_turner> ok.
[00:34] <blkadder> ryan_turner: Do you have usbmount installed?
[00:34] <ryan_turner> usbmount: command not found
[00:34] <ryan_turner> no idea other than that.
[00:34] <escott> ryan_turner, so naut complains it is read-only. but you could touch a file right now correct? (without removing/replugging the usb disk)
[00:34] <ryan_turner> escott, yep.
[00:34] <ryan_turner> blkadder, no usbmount is not installed.
[00:34] <jrib> Gerowen: huh.  I wonder when that got implemented.
[00:34] <escott> Gerowen, add it to fstab
[00:34] <escott> jrib, 12.10
[00:34] <ryan_turner> jrib, how do I press reload.
[00:35] <jrib> ryan_turner: view -> reload.  Check the menus.
[00:35] <Gerowen> I never noticed it in 12.04, and I was going to add it in /etc/fstab, but I'd like to change that behavior for "all" removable devices so I don't have to worry about it in the future.
[00:35] <ryan_turner> jrib, Ok. Didnt resolve.
[00:35] <escott> Gerowen, "sudo blkid" and find the UUID for the disk, then create an entry like the one for "/" in fstab but with /media/Storage as the mountpoint and the final numbers should both be zero
[00:35] <escott> Gerowen, and of course change the UUID
[00:36] <ryan_turner> blkadder, should i install usbmount?
[00:36] <escott> Gerowen, its a needed security feature when dealing with FAT/NTFS disks
[00:37] <Gerowen> escott: I've formatted in in ext4, but if that's the reason the behavior was implemented it's not the end of the world, I can work around it.
[00:37] <Gerowen> it*
[00:37] <jrib> ryan_turner: so what touch command can you execute ok on the drive to create a file?
[00:37] <ryan_turner> jrib, ryan_turner@ryan-turner-desktop:~$ touch /media/ryan_turner/Relliott/test2
[00:37] <jirido> Hi can i add any flag to: sudo dpkg --get-selections > installed-software, to get a list with only manually installed packages without dependencies or originally installed packages in it?
[00:37] <escott> ryan_turner, you can dmesg | tail just to make sure that nothing funky is going on with the disk, but it sounds like naut is having some weird issues

[00:52] <ryan_turner> blkadder, ok, unmounted and remounted as per your command
[00:52] <blkadder> I am a little old school when it comes to these thing.
[00:52] <ryan_turner> now create folder and document are greyed out in nautilus
[00:52] <ryan_turner> did view->reload
[00:52] <ryan_turner> went back to read only error
[00:53] <blkadder> ryan_turner: please pastebin the output of mount
[00:53] <riderplus> i'd kill nautilus if i were you ^^
[00:53] <blkadder> riderplus: I think I agree.
[00:53] <riderplus> literally
[00:53] <jrib> ryan_turner: out of curiosity, can you create files *anywhere* (for example in your home) using nautilus?
[00:53] <ryan_turner> blkadder, heres mount's output: http://pastebin.com/iADd9C77
[00:53] <riderplus> nautilus -HUP
[00:53] <ryan_turner> jrib, just made a doc in my home./
[00:54] <ryan_turner> no problem
[00:54] <jrib> ryan_turner: ok
[00:54] <ryan_turner> should I -HUP it? :)
[00:54] <ryan_turner> Could not parse arguments: Unknown option -HUP
[00:54] <riderplus> nautilus -q
[00:54] <blkadder> sudo nautilis -q
[00:54] <blkadder> Sorry spelling.
[00:55] <ryan_turner> ok did that
[00:55] <ryan_turner> what now?
[00:55] <blkadder> Well, is stuff still greyed out?
[00:56] <escott> ryan_turner, make sure its dead "ps aux | grep nautilus" then open naut again
[00:56] <ryan_turner> ... I still have a window open
[00:56] <ryan_turner> 3 actually.
[00:56] <escott> ryan_turner, killall nautilus
[00:56] <ryan_turner> pooof :)
[00:56] <blkadder> Yes, you need to kill then restart. :-)
[00:56] <ryan_turner> escott, there are none open now.
[00:56] <ryan_turner> Time to open it back
[00:56] <ryan_turner> Yay!
[00:57] <ryan_turner> It worked!
[00:57] <escott> ryan_turner, laugh in your most evil fashion.
[00:57] <escott> ryan_turner, then reopen nautilus
[00:57] <ryan_turner> So did we just "solve" the problem by just restarting nautilus... lol
[00:57] <ryan_turner> sounds like a windows solution
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest87078
[00:57] <escott> ryan_turner, it must not have realized the inode for the mountpoint changed?
[00:57] <riderplus> yeah...it's no laughing matter...
[00:58] <Guest87078> oh my penis
[00:58] <Guest87078> its o hard
[00:58] <Guest87078> FUCK ME~!
[00:58] <escott> ryan_turner, in any case when you umount the drive again you need to cleanup and remove the folder you "mkdir"ed
[00:58] <ryan_turner> riderplus, escott, blkadder, jrib, Ben64, thanks much!
[00:58] <riderplus> no worries ^^
[00:59] <blkadder> There is probably sum issue with the notification chain to the app...
[00:59] <blkadder> err some that tis.
[00:59] <blkadder> Crap I can't type today.
[00:59] <Hilikus> is it possible to install a bluray rom and watch HD movies in ubuntu?
[00:59] <Hilikus> directly from the disk, without having to rip anything
[00:59] <francesco_> sorry to bother again. My problem persist. Even if I used live USB creator to create a USB stick with bootable Ubuntu, when I boot my laptop I get only grub rescue. The pen drive blinks, but then nothing happens and then I see grub rescue. Is there a way to change the MBR from grub rescue?
[01:01] <riderplus> francesco_ well, let's put it the stupid way: did you change the boot device order in bios?
[01:01] <escott> !bluray
[01:01] <ubottu> For multimedia issues, this page has useful information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats - See also https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/media.html  - But please use free formats if you can: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeFormats
[01:01] <escott> Hilikus, see ^^^^
[01:01] <escott> francesco_, what is the bios configured to boot first?
[01:02] <francesco_> yes. and I have also another problem. I don't know why, I can't access the bios every time, but the message "press f2 or f12" appears only from time to time, so don't ask me what is the exact order after the USB. I managed once to enter the bios and put the USB as 1st, but I don't remember what was following.
[01:04] <riderplus> now if you have BIOS issues..i'm out of ideas
[01:04] <pepee> is anyone having problems with USB ports, and DVD recorders?
[01:05] <escott> francesco_, you have to make a ritual sacrifice before entering the bios. are you doing that?
[01:05] <riderplus> lol
[01:06] <pepee> I'm getting "exception Emask 0x0 SAct 0x0 SErr 0x0 action 0x6 frozen" from TWO different DVD burners :/
[01:06] <escott> francesco_, being serious now. they will give you about a nano-second between initializing the keyboard and displaying the post on screen to allow you to hit the key. best bet is to hit is repeatedly and as quickly as possible
[01:07] <dcope> Anyone know why Ubuntu would be reporting the wrong size TV when connected via hdmi?
[01:07] <Hilikus> is there a guide to install win7 so that i don't lose grub/ubuntu?
[01:07] <francesco_> I googled my problem all yesterday and saw that many people can't access their bios in their lenovo laptops
[01:07] <riderplus> i wonder if he has two usb entries like i have in BIOS ...
[01:07] <qwiksilver711> having problems running a second monitor on my laptop with 12.04
[01:07] <pepee> Hilikus, reinstall grub after installing windows
=== codezombie|away is now known as codezombie
[01:08] <qwiksilver711> am i stuck with bumblebee?
[01:08] <pepee> dcope, that depends on the graphics driver
[01:08] <pepee> qwiksilver711, same as ^
[01:08] <Hilikus> pepee: how can i do that from windows?
[01:08] <pepee> Hilikus, AFAIK you can't, but you can use the same live cd to reinstall grub
[01:09] <dcope> pepee: i'm just using Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller
[01:09] <dcope> should be pretty standard
[01:09] <passenger> hello
[01:09] <qwiksilver711> I have installed the nvidia driver
[01:10] <pepee> dcope, I'd ask in #intel-gfx
[01:10] <Sylphie> hello passenger
[01:10] <pepee> hi passenger
[01:10] <francesco_> riderplus: I have 2 usb entries in BIOS, but I know which one I put first
[01:10] <qwiksilver711> I assume bumblebee would work?
[01:10] <riderplus> francesco_ yeah I guessed so
[01:11] <riderplus> I'm 60% sure it's hdd usb
[01:11] <pepee> qwiksilver711, try #nvidia
[01:11] <bumblebee> Yeah, I work... :)
=== dror is now known as redweed
[01:11] <pepee> heh
[01:12] <francesco_> riderplus: what I find strange is that I should be able from grub rescue to see the grub file in my pen drive, but I'm not.
[01:12] <escott> dcope, the TV may be lying in the edid information
[01:12] <pepee> dcope, also, run xrandr in the console
[01:13] <riderplus> francesco_ your problem is with the boot device order...you need to set the right USB flash first
[01:13] <riderplus> otherwise it won't boot your USB
[01:13] <riderplus> it shouldn't boot any grub rescue crap
[01:14] <francesco_> riderplus: I'll try to access the bios again and put both usb at the top of the order, followed by dvd and then all the hard disks
[01:14] <francesco_> riderplus: but is there anything I can do from the stupid grub rescue?
[01:14] <riderplus> francesco_ ok try both USB-s and see which one boots up
[01:14] <riderplus> francesco_ no, leave that out
[01:15] <riderplus> francesco_ focus on what you can do
[01:15] <BroUnicorn> Okay guys
[01:15] <BroUnicorn> How do I install ubuntu on a windows laptop
[01:15] <BroUnicorn> dual boot that is
[01:15] <riderplus> one of the USBs must boot francesco_
[01:15] <BroUnicorn> trying to do it for a friends
[01:15] <BroUnicorn> friend*
[01:15] <FloodBot1> BroUnicorn: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[01:16] <riderplus> BroUnicorn insert the Ubuntu disk and follow the instructions
[01:16] <escott> BroUnicorn, well you stick the disk into the CD slot, and you reboot...
[01:16] <blkadder> BroUnicorn: Would you like a pointer to Let me google that for you?
[01:16] <escott> BroUnicorn, maybe some part of this isn't working and you want to ask us a specific question about what is not working?
[01:17] <dcope> pepee: ok, what am i looking for in xrandr?
[01:17] <BroUnicorn> No, just after having issues with it not correctly creating a partition on my computer I want to make sure not to mess up my friends computer
[01:17] <escott> dcope, it will show all the screensizes that have been auto-configured
[01:17] <pepee> dcope, the supported resolutions
[01:17] <BroUnicorn> because he does not have dual boot. He only has windows, so if it messes up windows he loses it
[01:17] <dcope> escott: it claims 1920x1080 is there
[01:17] <riderplus> BroUnicorn you can't mess it up
[01:17] <dcope> escott: but when i use that resolution i can barely see the sidebar on the left
[01:18] <escott> dcope, does it have a * next to the 1080 resolution
[01:18] <BroUnicorn> riderplus: False, it totally screwed mine up
[01:18] <escott> dcope, thats called overscan
[01:18] <riderplus> BroUnicorn the ubuntu installer is pretty clear on what it does
[01:18] <blkadder> riderplus: You sure you want to throw down the gauntlet like that?
[01:18] <dcope> escott: nope, it has a + next to it. the * is next to 1400x1050
[01:18] <BroUnicorn> riderplus: Right, until it throws an install error and messes up your partition table
[01:18] <escott> dcope, you might be able to disable overscan correction in the TV itself or you can modify the +h +v in the modeline with xrandr to fix it manually
[01:18] <BroUnicorn> riderplus: lol I'm just making sure I don't mess it up
[01:18] <riderplus> BroUnicorn that might be your fault, not ubuntu's
[01:18] <BroUnicorn> riderplus: So I don't have to priorly make sure there is free space that isn't attached to the windows partition?
[01:19] <escott> dcope, then the resolution you are currently using is the 1050. ctrl-alt-+ maybe increases you to the 1080 resolution... i always use the gui
[01:19] <dcope> escott: cool, ill try on the tv
[01:19] <Sylphie> of course, it's never the fault of the too many chefs
[01:19] <riderplus> well, you MUST be sure you have free space
[01:19] <BroUnicorn> riderplus: It says he has free space, but it's attached to his windows partition
[01:19] <BroUnicorn> Do I have to unpartition it from his windows drive first?
[01:20] <blkadder> BroUnicorn: Then you need to repartition.
[01:20] <BroUnicorn> blkadder: See, that's what I was trying to ask lol. How do I do that on a windows?
[01:20] <blkadder> Use a gparted boot disk or something...
[01:20] <riderplus> partition magic
[01:20] <escott> BroUnicorn, you should do the resizing of the windows partition from the livecd or the installer
[01:20] <riderplus> but back up your data
[01:20] <riderplus> if you have any...
[01:20] <BroUnicorn> From the ubuntu livecd?
[01:20] <blkadder> Yes, please backup first.
[01:21] <riderplus> yes you can use the ubuntu livecd
[01:21] <riderplus> just be careful when you repartition
[01:21] <BroUnicorn> How would I repartition his windows from the ubuntu lived? I don't want to mess with the partition table on the advanced options.
[01:21] <BroUnicorn> That's how mine got messed up
[01:22] <qwiksilver711> is there any way to make nvidia optimus cards function with a second monitor
[01:22] <usr13> BroUnicorn: Was your win7?
[01:22] <riderplus> that's why it's better to have at least two partitions...always
[01:22] <BroUnicorn> usr13: Yes
[01:22] <escott> BroUnicorn, you could do the "install alongside" and have ubuntu do it automatically, or you could use the installer gui (which I hate) or you could use gparted in the livecd
[01:22] <usr13> BroUnicorn: How did you mess it up?
[01:23] <BroUnicorn> usr13: The installer threw me an error, but I think it's because all of the memory was either partitioned to windows or osx
[01:23] <BroUnicorn> then it tried to install ubuntu alongside it, threw an error, then popped up the partition table
[01:24] <riderplus> was it windows or osx? that's important
[01:24] <escott> BroUnicorn, the OSX business is going to make things confusing. you should setup the bootcamp for linux from mac
[01:24] <BroUnicorn> escott: So doing the automatic install alongside will automatically repartition it making room on his windows?
[01:24] <usr13> BroUnicorn: Well, just wondering.  I've done it a number of times and haven't had a problem yet.
[01:24] <escott> BroUnicorn, because you probably have a hybrid partition table... and its very possible ubuntu picks the wrong one to mess  with
[01:24] <riderplus> me 2
[01:24] <BroUnicorn> escott: I'm doing this on my friends windows. I've figured out my computer already. So I just need to make sure I'm doing the windows correctly
[01:24] <ae86-drifter> hey there, my system specs are 4GB ddr800, gtx 640 1gb, 2x160GB hdd, quad core cpu(q6600), I was thinking of doing a software raid0, how much of a performance gain will i get for hdd r/w?
[01:24] <BroUnicorn> escott: So on a windows all I have to do is put in the live-cd and let it automatically do its thing?
[01:25] <riderplus> BroUnicorn choose to install ubuntu alongside
[01:25] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: If anyone claims they know, they are most likely confused.
[01:25] <escott> ae86-drifter, a bit less than 2x
[01:25] <BroUnicorn> riderplus: Okay
[01:25] <Sylphie> ae86-drifter \ software raid, little gain, possibly run slower
[01:25] <riderplus> but it's windows, not osx i hope
[01:25] <escott> BroUnicorn, im confused as to what computer you are talking about. does this have OSX or not?
[01:25] <riderplus> if it's osx you'll screw it up
[01:25] <ae86-drifter> always get mixed answers, lol...
[01:26] <BroUnicorn> escott: It does not. It's a windows.
[01:26] <BroUnicorn> escott: Windows 7 specifically that we want to boot alongside
[01:26] <Sylphie> ae86-drifter \ with software  raid it's duplicating writes through a controller which will still have the same bandwidth
[01:26] <riderplus> BroUnicorn then you shouldn't have any issues...
[01:26] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: It is largely dependent on the disk, the workloads involved, etc. There isn't one right answer.
[01:26] <blkadder> It is a trick question. :-)
[01:26] <ae86-drifter> Sylphie: are you sure about that?
[01:26] <dylan> I need to convert .mkv files to something else like a .mp4.  How do I do that?
[01:27] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: theyre seagate 7,200rpm's
[01:27] <riderplus> dylan find a suitable converter
[01:27] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: You can tell me and it won't help in the slightest. :-) I am just giving you some variables, not an indication I have a clue.
[01:27] <Sylphie> ae86-drifter \ that's how software raid works, each write the OS wants to do it written multiple times to multiple disks. Problem is, it's using the same diskcontroller and does those multiple writes sequentially
[01:27] <ae86-drifter> my understanding is that it will consume CPU, which is what i am worried about
[01:28] <dylan> riderplus:  Was asking if anyone knew a good one.
[01:28] <riderplus> dylan http://lmgtfy.com/?q=convert+mkv+to+mp4+ubuntu
[01:28] <blkadder> Slyphie: Not RAID-0 (striping) I believe...
[01:28] <MonkeyDust> dylan  ffmpag or avconv
[01:28] <blkadder> Although software raid might be different.
[01:28] <MonkeyDust> dylan  ffmpeg or avconv
[01:28] <escott> Sylphie, are sata controllers not capable of accessing different disks synchronously?
[01:28] <ae86-drifter> Sylphie: i think you're thinking of RAID 1 ??
[01:29] <usr13> dylan: http://askubuntu.com/questions/50433/how-to-convert-mkv-file-into-mp4-file-losslessly
[01:30] <Sylphie> ae86-drifter \ which software raid were you thinking of?
[01:31]  * riderplus goes to sleep
[01:31] <ae86-drifter> Sylphie: I haven't decided, doing research atm..
[01:31] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: Also, are there only two disks in your system? If so doing raid-0 on them is a pretty bad idea unless you are really good about backups and are willing to rebuild everything if you lose a single drive.
[01:31] <ae86-drifter> Sylphie: I am leaning towards mdadm...
[01:32] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: the only thing i am worried about losing in my ssh keys which i have a backup of
[01:32] <ae86-drifter> i don't care about my data, i have enough backups
[01:32] <Sylphie> ae86-drifter \ hardware raid isn't too hard to buy
[01:32] <escott> Sylphie, really?!
[01:32] <ae86-drifter> Sylphie: get my IT dept to approve it then, lol.
[01:33] <RollinV2> cloud storage
[01:33] <dylan> thanks usr13!
[01:33] <Sylphie> SAS raid controllers can handle SATA drives
[01:33] <escott> Sylphie, i guess technically its not hard to buy them... but they are still crazy expensive
[01:33] <blkadder> LOL
[01:33] <Sylphie> a surplus SAS controller can be relatively affrdable on ebay
[01:34] <blkadder> escott: For sata drives?
[01:34] <blkadder> A number of MBs have raid support built-in these days...
[01:34] <blkadder> And it is anything but expensive.
[01:34] <escott> blkadder, which is not real RAID
[01:34] <ae86-drifter> Sylphie: I would if it was my personal machine :) but I'm not going to spend money on this, it was hard enough gettting them to approve a gtx 640
[01:34] <blkadder> Oh that tired argument.
[01:35] <blkadder> Well let's just say that the "fake RAID" provided by such solutions has served me well. :-)
[01:36] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: my motherboard doesn't hence why i wanna use software raid, i have never done software raid, but I have done hardware raid close to 100 times or more.
=== jono is now known as Guest3379
[01:38] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: Understood. I'm just saying that no one is going to be able to tell you what sort of performance improvement (if any) you are going to see. That is something you will have to test for yourself. People may claim to know, and they are generally confused. :-)
[01:39] <Sylphie> thee is a lsi sas controller on ebay right now for 29.95 buy-now
[01:40] <th3pun15h3r> has anyone tried using those ethernet av kits for internet instead of wifi?
[01:41] <rob_p> ethernet av kit?
[01:41] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ sounds interesting, could you describe?
[01:41] <blkadder> You mean powerline?
[01:42] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: yeah okay, i've only ever done RAID1,5 &6, never RAID0 also have never done software RAID, do you think that there will be bottlenecks in the SATA controller or my CPU? i'm thinking CPU as q6600 is a POS
[01:42] <th3pun15h3r> dude q6600 still a good cpu
[01:42] <th3pun15h3r> I use a q6700 still
[01:43] <ae86-drifter> th3pun15h3r: q6600 is rubbish
[01:43] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ so you do mean powerline ethernet
[01:43] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: My understanding of software RAID as it pertains to Linux in general is that the CPU hit is pretty minimal these days.
[01:43] <blkadder> So I wouldn't be overly-concerned about it.
[01:43] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ how would you go about setting that up for outside internet connection?
[01:45] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ so you'd want to connect to the lan-side of her outside connection?
[01:46] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: But I'd seriously consider spending $50 or $100 or whatever and getting a SSD for a boot drive and then striping the spindles. That is most likely going to smoke anything you are going to do with simply RAID-0'ing the two drives you have.
[01:47] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ if so, that's what powerline ethernet is designed for
=== codezombie is now known as codezombie|away
[01:47] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ yes, that could work
[01:48] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ true. the only way you can tell about line quality is to actually try it
[01:48] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: yeah, i know, lol, my home computer has an ssd boot drive, my manager wont approve it for my work machine
[01:49] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: i'm trying for performance for $0
[01:49] <th3pun15h3r> brb
[01:49] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ firber optic from your isp won't help your connection problems between rooms
[01:49] <escott> ae86-drifter, if the choice is between RAID0 and non-raid... RAID0 should be faster
[01:49] <ae86-drifter> was hoping to speak to someone who has done it before on 12.10
[01:49] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: Tough boss. You should talk to them about the performance improvements associated with being able to boot and access business-related data faster. :-)
[01:50] <ae86-drifter> escott: yeah, that's correct, but i am worried about it impacting my CPU too much
[01:51] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: I already have a 2nd machine which is an i7, 8gb ram etc, the problem is, it must remain windows 7
[01:51] <ae86-drifter> so i wantto make my linux machine a beast
[01:51] <escott> ae86-drifter, the slower memory performance of a ddr2 system isn't going to help, but you were already facing that
[01:52] <ae86-drifter> escott: I assumed that would be irrelevant to hdd r/w speeds
[01:52] <escott> ae86-drifter, the big problem with RAID0 is having to split/zip those memory blocks as they go on/come off the disk
[01:52] <ae86-drifter> in my case
[01:53]  * th3pun15h3r hates raid
[01:53] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ fiber optic from your isp won't help your connection problems between rooms. But have you considered being a home handyman and laying down a length of normal ethernet cable?
[01:53] <BroUnicorn> Okay guys
[01:53] <BroUnicorn> So I'm trying to install ubuntu on my friends windows
[01:53] <escott> ae86-drifter, the disk is slow enough that the CPU shouldn't have any trouble processing the actual requests
[01:53] <ae86-drifter> okay cool
[01:54] <ae86-drifter> i'm going to do a benchmark before and after software raid on 12.10
[01:54] <BroUnicorn> It came to a menu after clicking install, but the install alongside option wasn't given
[01:54] <ae86-drifter> and hdd benchmark tools recommended?
[01:54] <pi__> Hello, from my raspberry pi
[01:54] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: If I understand you correctly, you are saying the hard drive needs to remain Windows 7. :-)
[01:55] <Sylphie> th3pun15h3r \ a tapemeasure would give you a rough idea
[01:55] <escott> blkadder, on the other machine
[01:55] <blkadder> escott: I understand...
[01:55] <KBentley57> hey guys, in light of the recent Java bug, oracle patched the jre up to version 7u11.  The repos show that ubuntu is on 7u9.  Is there any plans to roll out a java update for Ubuntu any time soon?
[01:56] <escott> ae86-drifter, bonnie++ comes to mind... but thats cause its the only one i can remember
[01:56] <escott> KBentley57, you shouldn't even have Oracle Java from ubuntu anymore
[01:56] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: no, i have 2 pc's one linux , one windows
[01:56] <Sylphie> KBentley57 \ the DHS says even 7u11 still has undixed bugs so they aren't unsaying their warning
[01:56] <escott> KBentley57, they arent allowed to distribute oracle java. you must be getting it from a PPA or something
[01:56] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: I understand and my point still stands.
[01:57] <ae86-drifter> escott: I had to use oracle version because the open one kept crashing, lol... I needed it to do my job
[01:57] <KBentley57> escott, Sylphie, perhaps I'm mistaken.  Is the openjdk in ubuntu based on oracle's release, or is it based on something different?
[01:57] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: Is the windows machine locked down? Are you prevented from booting from USB, etc.?
[01:57] <escott> KBentley57, the other way around oracle/sun java7 is based on openJDK
[01:58] <Sylphie> KBentley57 \ it's the jre package you have to worry about
[01:58] <escott> KBentley57, but it was originally a whiteroom implementation
[01:58] <escott> iirc
[01:58] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: installing linux on that machine is NOT an option, rofl...
[01:58] <KBentley57> Ah I see, thanks for clearing that up.
[01:58] <ae86-drifter> i would potentially lose my job
[01:58] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: I did not say anything about installing Linux on it.
[01:58] <ae86-drifter> i could if i wanted to, but that's beside the point
[01:58] <blkadder> I asked if you are able to boot from USB?
[01:58] <blkadder> Actually it isn't.
[01:58] <xangua>  Sylphie escott so there should be no problems if i use the openjdk plugin for the browser¿
[01:59] <KBentley57> So, the security hole that was introduced somewhere in oracles altering of the openjdk?
[01:59] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: what would i use that machine for then?
[01:59] <escott> BroUnicorn, if you select the "try ubuntu first" option and then run "sudo parted -l" and send that to us it would help
[01:59] <BroUnicorn> Okay, what will that do?
[01:59] <BroUnicorn> escott: Thank you for the response by the way
[01:59] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: yes, they both boot from usb....
[01:59] <Sylphie> xangua \ right now I wouldn't use any java until there is a safe version
[01:59] <blkadder> Boot from USB, enjoy all the power for your Ubuntu needs and point storage to your q6600 machine.
[01:59] <escott> xangua, some of these java vulnerabilities were fundamental API issues was my understanding.
[02:00] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: what are you getting at? i dont understand..
[02:00] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: that is not an option, as i said before, lol...
[02:00] <escott> KBentley57, the reported problems were for java6 which is not a common codebase with openjdk
[02:00] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: Do you understand that you can boot from a USB device without touching the disk on a host machine?
[02:01] <KBentley57> escott, I was under the impression that it was java7 that was the culprit
[02:01] <blkadder> Meaning you can use your Windows box to boot Linux without altering anything on the windows box?
[02:01] <escott> KBentley57, but some (not all) of the problems are API issues and would affect any java implementation
[02:01] <Sylphie> KBentley57 \ so far there has never been a completely secure version of java
[02:01] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: i'm completely aware of that
[02:01] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: i'm not an idiot
[02:01] <KBentley57> Understandable, it's impossible to have a completely secure version of any nontrivial software package really
[02:02] <escott> KBentley57, that was my reading about 6 months ago... the new one could be different, my eyes have glazed over WRT java vulns
[02:02] <Sylphie> KBentley57 \ it's just that in 7u-whatever, the security holes are too major to ignore
[02:02] <ae86-drifter> there is a such thing as company policies
[02:02] <escott> BroUnicorn, allow us to see how the disk is partition
[02:02] <KBentley57> http://tinyurl.com/cvw6ghy
[02:02] <blkadder> ae86-drifter: Then why do you keep referring to "installing Linux" not being an option, given that we aren't discussing installing anything?
[02:03] <ae86-drifter> as i was trying to explain to you before - it is not an option..
[02:03] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: shhh
[02:03] <blkadder> LOL
[02:03] <BroUnicorn> How do I open a terminal on ubuntu on windows?
[02:03] <KBentley57> inside a virtual maching Bronie?
[02:04] <Dammit> question - is there a .exe installer available for ubuntu? i can only find the .iso on the website. thx.
[02:04] <xangua> BroUnicorn: control+alt-t
[02:04] <bumblebee> ctrl+alt+t
[02:04] <pinkpelican> I'm having trouble installing Ubuntu onto a computer.
[02:04] <pinkpelican> I'm trying a live USB, but the grub only recognizes the previous Windows installation.
[02:05] <Sylphie> Dammit \ you mean something like wubi?
[02:05] <ae86-drifter> i have a windows PC for a reason, i need to use it, just like i have a linux PC, i have to use it, lol simple as that, not to mention it is against the companies policy and i may get fired for running unauthorized software, let alone another OS, where as with my linux machine i can do whatever i want to. do you understand now?
[02:05] <BroUnicorn> escott: Okay, I did that
[02:05] <lee8oi> The E17 desktop is hands down the most fun I've had customizing in a long time.
[02:05] <BroUnicorn> escott: sudo parted -l
[02:05] <Dammit> @sylphie -yes. exactly.
[02:05] <escott> KBentley57, CVE-2013-0422 is a java7 and probably also affects openJDK.. the whole reflection API is just getting torn apart by white hats these days
[02:05] <ubottu> Multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle Java 7 before Update 11 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by (1) using the public getMBeanInstantiator method in the JmxMBeanServer class to obtain a reference to a private MBeanInstantiator object, then retrieving arbitrary Class references using the findClass method, and (2) using the Reflection API with recursion in a way tha...

[02:06] <Dammit> the .iso is whre the wubi shouls be
[02:06] <ae86-drifter> they are also on seperate networks, so i would need to also setup some sort of router
[02:06] <KBentley57> escott, what is what it sounded like to me too.   Apparently oracles jre and the openjdk-jre version numbers don't sync, unless the ojdk hasn't been patched up as quickly
[02:07] <escott> KBentley57, it hasn't
[02:07] <Sylphie> Dammit \ the iso is a bit large for slow connections ... :(
[02:07] <escott> KBentley57, thats part of why DHS and the like are saying disable it. Oracle has completely dropped the ball on the updates
[02:07] <blkadder> ae68-drifter: Absolutely! That is all I was asking. I totally get company policy, etc. I was just trying to understand the constraints, as they aren't techincal.
[02:07] <KBentley57> is there a settings panel for the jre in ubuntu?
[02:08] <blkadder> technical even. :-)
[02:08] <Sylphie> KBentley57 \ you can actually uninstall the whole jre
[02:08] <Dammit> Sylphie \ I was able to get the iso...I was hoping there would be a simple .exe file. am I looking in the wrong spot for the .exe?
[02:08] <pinkpelican> Oh God XChat can't scroll up
[02:08] <KBentley57> yeah, I know that, but I do have a program which requires java to run, so I'm sort of stuck
[02:08] <escott> BroUnicorn, ie you need to send me what that output was. i need to see it
[02:09] <ae86-drifter> blkadder: i appreciate the help
[02:09] <KBentley57> pinkpelican, mouse wheel up
[02:09] <pinkpelican> I don't have a mousewheel!
[02:09] <pinkpelican> Is there a channel where I can receive help installing Ubuntu?
[02:10] <escott> pinkpelican, this channel
[02:10] <BroUnicorn> escott: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1540058/
[02:10] <escott> BroUnicorn, you have 4 partitions already. you have to delete one first
[02:10] <KBentley57> pinkpelican, use page_up key
[02:10] <Sylphie> Dammit \ http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer
=== codezombie|away is now known as codezombie
[02:11] <BroUnicorn> escott: What's the third partition for?
[02:11] <escott> BroUnicorn, one of those is windows, another is windows backup a third i have no idea. the fourth is probably something that the laptop manufacturer created to store drivers and the like
[02:11] <KBentley57> pinkpelican, and also the page down key :)
[02:11] <BroUnicorn> escott: So it's probably safe to delete the third.
[02:11] <pinkpelican> Yes that worked.
[02:11] <Dammit> Sylphie \ heh...that gives me the iso image.
[02:11] <escott> BroUnicorn, i would look at the contents of partition 4 and see if you can remove it
[02:11] <BroUnicorn> escott: Or the third is the livedisc?
[02:11] <Sylphie> oh :) sorry.
[02:11] <BroUnicorn> escott: Even though it contains drivers?
[02:11] <escott> BroUnicorn, the livecd is /dev/sr0
[02:11] <Dammit> no worries : )
[02:11] <escott> BroUnicorn, the drivers are installed by now.
[02:12] <BroUnicorn> escott: Okay. So how do I see what's on these partitions?
[02:12] <pinkpelican> I deleted the partition hoping that it would boot from USB
[02:12] <escott> BroUnicorn, open the file browser
[02:12] <pinkpelican> Now a grub prompt comes up that says no partition.
[02:13] <escott> BroUnicorn, match them up by size. sda1 is 209MB (windows boot??), sda2 is 300GB (windows proper), sda3 is 20GB (windows backup?), sda4 is 108MB (OEM drivers?)
[02:13] <Dammit> Sylphie \ thanks anyways...i will work it out with the iso.
[02:13] <pinkpelican> I really just want to shred the partition and restart with an Ubuntu install.
[02:13] <Sylphie> Dammit \ when you insert the disk, the autorun should take over. If you need to see what app the autorun pointed to, type out the autorun.inf file
[02:14] <BroUnicorn> escott: Okay so on the file browser says the 104.2MB one is HP Tools containing recycling bin and BIOS boot files
[02:14] <escott> BroUnicorn, the big headache is you probably want to steal space from sda2, but there is no free space adjacent to sda2 unless you remove sda3 which you might or might not want tot
[02:14] <escott> do
=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[02:14] <Sylphie> Dammit \ so you'r basically almost there
[02:14] <BroUnicorn> I can't figure out which is sad 3
[02:14] <BroUnicorn> sda*
[02:15] <BroUnicorn> There are three Devices showing up on the ubuntu desktop list
[02:15] <BroUnicorn> HP_TOOLS
[02:15] <BroUnicorn> 300 GB Volume
[02:15] <BroUnicorn> and SYSTEM. (sorry for the spacing)
[02:15] <escott> BroUnicorn, HP_TOOLS is sda4, 300GB volume is sda2
[02:16] <Ben64> BroUnicorn: if you type "mount" on a terminal, it will show you what is mounted where
[02:16] <blkadder> That is likely an emergency restore partition.
[02:16] <pinkpelican> I have a live USB and also a Win 7 install cd and the computer won't recognize either.
[02:16] <ae86-drifter> thanks for the help everyone, lol, i'm now closing all applications to benchmark my machine XD
[02:16] <blkadder> :-)
[02:16] <KBentley57> ha, hot damn.  escott Sylphie I just ran apt-get update and behold, a new jre update is available
[02:17] <BroUnicorn> escott: Is sda 3 System?
[02:17] <escott> BroUnicorn, not sure
[02:17] <ae86-drifter> rofl b4 i go
[02:17] <ae86-drifter> lol
[02:17] <escott> BroUnicorn, you can open it in nautilus and then check "mount"
[02:17] <BroUnicorn> escott: Okay. I'm not sure how to figure out either.
[02:17] <Sylphie> KBentley57 \ according to the DHS it's not safe yet
[02:17] <BroUnicorn> escott: What's nautilus?
[02:17] <BroUnicorn> escott: I'll do that.
[02:17] <pinkpelican> It says grub loading, error no such partition, grub rescue.
[02:17] <KBentley57> Sylphie, Yes, I'm reading that now
[02:18] <pinkpelican> Is there anything I can do?
[02:18] <escott> KBentley57, at the rate the white hats are finding these the blackhats already have a half-dozen in their pockets

[02:23] <Sylphie> KBentley57 \ I don't know if you can run jail from linux, but if you could it would make even java safe to use
[02:23] <machicola> if i have an mp3 player connected to my laptop & am viewing its files where would I access these via command line? i'm at /mnt but the dir is empty
[02:24] <escott> machicola, depends on the mp3 player. and removable devices are mounted to /media
[02:24] <pinkpelican> How do I enter the bios on my machine?
[02:24] <escott> pinkpelican, one of the keys on your keyboard
[02:24] <Sylphie> machicola \ the device should come up as /dev/sd-something
[02:24] <KBentley57> pinkpelican, usually f2, or del as it is booting
[02:24] <pinkpelican> escott, how do I know which key?
[02:24] <escott> pinkpelican, usually a function key, sometimes shift or control. it should flash it at you during boot
[02:24] <specious> pinkpelican: hit them all
[02:24] <machicola> ahh, there it is, thankyou
[02:25] <specious> pinkpelican: F1 F2 F10 F12
[02:25] <pinkpelican> It says I can press tab to display bios, but they just flicker on the screen for a second.
[02:25] <escott> pinkpelican, and hit them repeatedly and quickly
[02:25] <machicola> it was in /media under some obscure name
[02:25] <escott> pinkpelican, so reboot and hit tab as many times as you can
[02:25] <specious> pinkpelican: mash that keyboard :)
[02:26] <escott> pinkpelican, finger workout. 40reps, ready 1.2.3.
[02:26] <Lupita> help I just edited my fstab and now I can edit again and I can boot ubuntu. what can i do ?

[02:30] <pinkpelican> Is it fdisk -l
[02:30] <escott> pinkpelican, you should use parted -l over fdisk -l since fdisk cannot read gpt disks

[02:31] <iFlip> Does anyone know how to setup (HMA)-VPN on DD-WRT? Or a good tutorial site...
[02:32] <blkadder> iFlip: Well, is HMA PPTP or OpenVPN or ?
[02:33] <usr13> iFlip: I've done dd-wrt
[02:34] <usr13> iFlip: just go to dd-wrt.com and look up your router in the database and follow instructions.
[02:35] <usr13> iFlip: You mean, install?  Or using it?
[02:35] <blkadder> HMA seems to have documentation as well... Why/how is that not working for you?
[02:36] <iFlip> usr13 I've tried PPTP and unfortunately OpenVPN is not available as a choice on this v.
[02:37] <iFlip> I have a friend in Germany that needs it setup and I've spent 6 hours total on call trying different setups through TeamViewer with no luck
[02:37] <iFlip> I even followed the WRT setup guide, HMA setup giude and several third party guides.
[02:38] <iFlip> I flashed my e2500 here in the states to see if it had different features and still couldn't get it to work.
[02:38] <blkadder> iFlip: So where does it fail?
[02:39] <JoeyB2> lol, hello
[02:39] <JoeyB2> anyone here?
[02:39] <blkadder> iFlip: And perhaps you should choose a better channel as this has nothing to do with ubuntu...
[02:40] <iFlip> blkadder Here is his setup - T-MOBILE router that connects him to the cloud. On the other side is the WRT router that needs the VPN. Sometimes I get all the PPTP info entered in the fields and reboot the WRT router and goto www.ip2location.com to check if it worked and it still saysy he is in germany
[02:40] <usr13> iFlip: Upgrade to the full featured image
[02:40] <JoeyB2> FYI - to the community in general... if you use tasksel to try to install a LAMP server, DON'T unselect ubuntu-desktop.  Just don't do it!
[02:41] <usr13> iFlip: /join #dd-wrt
[02:41] <iFlip> I thought it was... how do i distinguish between FULL and well not FULL... I thought I was downloading the FULL
[02:41] <usr13> JoeyB2: Having problems?
[02:41] <iFlip> usr13 Point taken - I guess VPN doesn't under networking anymore. ;)
[02:42] <JoeyB2> lol, you could say that!
[02:42] <usr13> iFlip: You can upgrade.
[02:42] <iFlip> usr13 I will try that
[02:42] <iFlip> usr13 I'd rather have OpenVPN anyway for him.

[02:44] <JoeyB2> I unselected ubuntu-desktop in tasksel and it uninstalled just about everything.  It finally stopped with it uninstalled aptitude
[02:44] <usr13> JoeyB2: I'm just kind-of curious so don't take this wrong, but why did you install ubuntu-desktop if your intention was just to build a server?
[02:44] <jrib> JoeyB2: yeah tasksel uninstalling was not recommended last time I checked
[02:45] <jrib> !tasksel | JoeyB2
[02:45] <ubottu> JoeyB2: Tasksel is a Debian/Ubuntu tool that installs multiple related packages as a co-ordinated "task" onto your system, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Tasksel for more information. Use tasksel only to INSTALL tasks, not to remove them. It will remove every package listed within the removed task! see https://launchpad.net/bugs/574287
[02:45] <JoeyB2> I unselected it because it was already installed... I didn't think it would uninstall everything
[02:45] <jrib> JoeyB2: can you install it back? :)
[02:46] <usr13> JoeyB2: What ever your problem is, you can more-than-likely fix it.

=== FreakingTea is now known as STFreakingTea
[02:48] <usr13> JoeyB2: Sounds like you may have the right idea; to just start over.
[02:48] <JoeyB2> aptitude is installed as a dependecy with tasksel, so I guess tasksel uses it
[02:48] <JoeyB2> yeah, it's a new install anyway, it just reinstalled, but I'm going to reboot and see what happens.  Grub will probably choke on it.

Even if it takes you a little longer, you're sometimes better off doing it on your own.

[02:58] <JoeyB2> usr13: noted!  haha, usually I AM the sort to install the proper way, but this seemed so easy.   Lesson learned.  Everything still works, btw, but I'm going to clean install anyway
[02:59] <JoeyB2> Sylphie: I think there's a plugin for version of Wordpress for postgres, you can try googling it
[02:59] <jrib> JoeyB2: tasksel is the proper way imo, just don't use it to uninstall things because of that bug...
[02:59] <craigbass1976> Anyone had trouble with a latop number pad not behaving as expected?  If numlock is off, I think hitting Shift and 7 (Home) should be highlighting everything from where my cursor is back to the beginning of the line.  I get a 7.
[02:59] <JoeyB2> jrib: That's an AMAZING bug.. reminds me of one ubuntu beta that formatted all attached drives when you installed... ALL of them!
[03:00] <Sylphie> I always found it was easy enough to install apache and some-sql-php from source
[03:00] <jrib> Sylphie: /why/ would you install from source...
[03:00] <JoeyB2> Sylphie is a closet BSD user i bet.
[03:01] <Flannel> craigbass1976: Does it function as [home] if you don't push shift?
[03:01] <Sylphie> when you install from source, you get the options you chose, not the options someone else chose
[03:01] <jrib> Sylphie: you also get to maintain it though
=== Err404NotFound is now known as Error404NotFound
[03:02] <Sylphie> jrin \ but that's no big task is you keep with stable versions
[03:03] <jrib> Sylphie: I suppose if you *need* some custom compiling options you have no choice, but otherwise you need to make sure you stay on top of security issues that come up and patch them yourself whereas with apt someone else worries about that
[03:05] <usr13> JoeyB2: I suppose you should take jrib's word for it, I've never uset tasksel  so....
[03:06] <JoeyB2> yeah, it seems legit, but dang, they should fix that bug PRONTO!
[03:06] <usr13> Sylphie: You can always re-configure to your taste
[03:07] <jrib> usr13, JoeyB2: nothing wrong with not using tasksel to setup lamp either (you can get the exact list of packages to install from ubottu's !lamp factoid), it's just a little quicker (in the sense that you "install" one thing: lamp-server)
[03:07] <craigbass1976> Flannel, yes, which makees it all the more maddening...

[03:25] <izx> I need to configure a Ubuntu server to follow a strict company password policy that specifies the following:
[03:25] <izx> at least one upper case
[03:25] <izx> , one lower case, one digit, one special character.. How do i do that??
[03:26] <dr_willis> yet more idiotic compaly policies.. ;)
[03:26] <jrib> izx: look into pam.  I have no idea of the details, but that's where I would start
[03:26] <escott> izx, i love those kinds of policies... it should be short and memorable so no more than 4 characters total
[03:26] <dr_willis> they started doing that here.. so over night 3000+ people forgot their passwords
[03:26] <JoeyB2> Password1! will be everyone's password within a week
[03:26] <Sylphie> gueriLLaPunK; I would then estimate it would take approx 18 hours to save 3tb to usb2 drives, assuming an effective practical speed of 50mb.sec

[03:28] <gueriLLaPunK> 9.10 aint cutting it
[03:28] <Sylphie> dr_willis \ with amax theortical speed of 60mb/sec, 50 seemed safe

[03:39] <Sylphie> saving to a usb drive he was getting usually 1mb/sec to at most 8mb/sec
[03:40] <memand> Sylphie: Well I'm not surprised, as far as I remember the pi only has 1 usb hub

[04:09] <escott> aliendude5300, but ACCESS sql varies significantly from other SQLs so you really do need to be using windows to complete your assignments properly
[04:10] <aliendude5300> escott, That's unfortunate, I figured SQL was pretty standardized... we're learning Access and Oracle SQL in the course I'm in, so I figured that wouldn't be too difficult to do in Linux

[04:12] <escott> aliendude5300, for very simple queries things might work on both, but ACCESS in particular has a piece of junk query parser (in fact it has two piece of junk query parsers) so even standard queries will break it

[05:28] <memand> ?
[05:28] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: No, this is on a friends windows
[05:28] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: was installing ubuntu. Had an error, so I had to delete the partition.
[05:28] <BroUnicorn> Now I can't get through to his windows.
[05:28] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, ok ... wait, WINDOWS?  so you installed via the windows installer?
[05:28] <BroUnicorn> The partition table isn't messed up
[05:28] <BroUnicorn> yeah
[05:29] <BroUnicorn> I could get into windows a few minutes ago, as the menu showed up at the beginning, but it wouldn't load into ubuntu
[05:29] <memand> windows installer is sheite no offence...
[05:29] <BroUnicorn> so I'm going back onto the ubuntu livedisc
[05:29] <BroUnicorn> so how can I fix this?
[05:30] <BroUnicorn> I think it's still trying to load the partition that I deleted and I just need to get it to load the windows bootloader
[05:30] <BroUnicorn> which is on sda1
[05:30]  * Onixs Bye!
[05:30] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, *wubi* shudder.  FYI: wubi is for TESTING ubuntu, not long term installation according to the developers.  Dual booting is the preferred method.  To fix the windows boot you need to use the windows disk and "repair/recover"
[05:30] <memand> BroUnicorn: and you'r sure you did not delete the windows partition?
[05:31] <BroUnicorn> memand: Yes.
[05:31] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, if you can still see the windows partition, then you should be able to recover/repair the MBR with the windows disk.
[05:32] <BroUnicorn> the MBR?
[05:32] <memand> I must say that I have never used wubi, so I'm on bare ground here...
[05:32] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, MasterBootRecord ...
[05:33] <cfhowlett> memand, personally, I say if you only want to test, use a virtual install ... virtualbox is good ...
[05:33] <memand> indeed
[05:33] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: I think I'm going to try reinstalling ubuntu to the partition that I deleted it from
[05:33] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: That ought to fix it
[05:33] <raddy> Hello Everybody
[05:33] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, ok.  proceed carefully.
[05:33] <merica> im having trouble with bumblebee again
[05:34] <cfhowlett> raddy, greetings
[05:34] <BroUnicorn> it only threw an error because we tried to have it download the updates at the same time

[05:34] <raddy> Is Microsoft Exchange support removed from Ubuntu version of Evolution?
[05:34] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, I don't want to hear it.  I'm in China.  Trust me, THIS is terrible internet.
[05:34] <memand> BroUnicorn: Is there a specific reason you installed it with wubi? And Is there anything very critical you don't want to loose on the drive?
=== james is now known as Guest68604
[05:35] <BroUnicorn> memand: No. There is not.
[05:36] <BroUnicorn> memand: I simply downloaded the most recent version and put it onto a dvd.
[05:36] <memand> BroUnicorn: then I would just wipe everything and install ubuntu clean on the disk
[05:36] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, really, seriously, find a dual boot tutorial and consider that option
[05:36] <BroUnicorn> memand: That's what I'm doing.
[05:36] <memand> Good :)
[05:36] <BroUnicorn> memand: Because I'm 99% positive the only reason I was getting the error is because it was trying to load the partition of ubuntu that I had just deleted
[05:37] <raddy> Is Microsoft Exchange support removed from Ubuntu version of Evolution?
[05:37] <memand> BroUnicorn: Again I don't have experience with wubi, but it sounds like a fair assumption
[05:38] <memand> cfhowlett: do you know how wubi actually works?
[05:38] <jambeedrum> does different browsers and different window managers have change of image quality ?
[05:38] <memand> cfhowlett: I mean does it make a ubuntu install, or is it kind of like the ubuntu version of wine?
[05:38] <cfhowlett> memand, in tech terms?  it emulates a new computer.  NOT wine..
[05:38] <memand> jambeedrum: not really
[05:39] <memand> cfhowlett: ok, so it's like a virtual machine?
[05:39] <elisa87> Hi I am running Ubuntu 12.04 on HP Pavilion dv3 beside no other OS. It wasn't slow at all but it's about one month that it has become damn slow and hangs and freezes every now and then. Do you know what's the reason and what are the solutions? I really need urgent help regarding this
[05:39] <cfhowlett> memand, it is an ubuntu install but as it exists in the windows filesystem, it's subject to windows errors that ubuntu/linux normally avoids, e.g. fragmentation
[05:40] <memand> cfhowlett: I'm really not conviced that wubi is a good idea...
[05:40] <dr_willis> in convinced its a bad idea
[05:40] <dr_willis> ;)
[05:40] <cfhowlett> memand, used for it's purpose, it's great.
[05:41] <memand> elisa87: is it slow to log in or slow in general?
[05:41] <cfhowlett> memand, interestingly, in 12.10, wubi was removed from the iso.  You can still get it but ...
[05:42] <elisa87> memand it's had become slow in login a little bit but mainly when I am working with internet or run spotify or just use ALT+TAB it just hangs and I should wait more than 30 seconds till it comes back to the normal operation
[05:42] <memand> cfhowlett: I just dont see the scenario where you would want to go with wubi instead of just trying it from the live disk
[05:43] <cfhowlett> memand, a little research goes a long way.  As I recall, wubi seemed less dangerous than trying to set up dual booting.  Of course, when wubi flamed out with the grub 2 upgrade, I was compelled to reconsider
[05:43] <memand> elisa87: have you installed anything reacently that could be sitting in the background taking up recources?
[05:44] <elisa87> everyday I have to install lots of things memand so I don't know which one is hurting the Ubuntu. Is there anyway to realize this?
[05:44] <skp1> anyone know how to stop all running pulseaudio processes?

[05:48] <grawity> dr_willis: "sound settings" has them, yes, but I'm curious about the "Sound Menu" specifically
[05:48] <dr_willis> but  the app may need to regiester itself in the menu. You are refering to the top right audio sound volumd  icon?
[05:48] <grawity> yes
[05:48] <dr_willis> ive seen that icon have sevveral players shown
[05:49] <memand> elisa87: did htop reveal anything?
[05:49] <WeThePeople> where is the .trash located

[05:50] <ubottu> Your GUI file manager's Trash folder is located at ~/.local/share/Trash/ for files moved to trash from your hard disk and .../.Trash-userid/ on external devices for files moved to trash from the device.
[05:50] <elisa87> memrand ok what should I realize from that !? I am a newbie
[05:50] <elisa87> memrand I don't know how to realize if it's revealing anything! There's lots of things shown after I wrote htop in terminal
[05:50] <dr_willis> elisa87:  whats listed as the top cpu hog? it sorts high to low
[05:51] <elisa87> dr_willis are you meaning CPU percentage?
[05:51] <elisa87> nothing more than 2%
[05:51] <memand> yes
[05:52] <elisa87> memand dr_willis compiz 12%
[05:52] <elisa87> dr_willis memand pidgin 21%
[05:52] <dr_willis> keep htop running and see if anything  pops to the top when the system hangs/lags
[05:53] <elisa87> OK
[05:53] <elisa87> Any other solution?
[05:53] <elisa87> I have not used anything from swap
[05:53] <elisa87> it says 119,000 task running! Is that normal?
[05:53] <memand> no
[05:56] <elisa87> dr_willis + memand I ran eclipse right now and it used 146% of CPU
[05:56] <dr_willis> mine says tasks: 132, 341   but im not sure what that really means
[05:57] <dr_willis> mine says tasks: 121, 341      Thr: 1
[05:57] <memand> dr_willis elisa87: ok maybe it is normal, I'm running a pretty striped down version of linux
[05:57] <memand> it just sounded like a lot
[05:57] <elisa87> So any solution all in all
[05:57] <elisa87> ?
[05:57] <dr_willis> whats the load average line say
[05:59] <dr_willis> my raspberry pi says     tasks:  60, 58  threads: 2
[05:59] <dr_willis> ;)
[05:59] <dr_willis> i think its not saying  121,341 thousand.. but something like 121 out of 341 are active... (but im not sure)
[06:00] <dr_willis> the way the #s are formated seem odd

[06:23] <ikonia> Borked: no its not, but what does it matter, you don't have to use what they are using
[06:23] <Borked> ikonia, yes it is
[06:23] <Borked> ikonia, they are using www.markmonitor.com to obfuscate their registrator
[06:24] <ikonia> no, that means they act as the registrar,

[06:25] <Borked> ikonia, really? I find that a little insulting
[06:25] <ikonia> the registrar has nothing to do with the OS of rht ehosting provider

[07:05] <heroclitis> MTW: What do you mean?
[07:06] <memand> try ping domain and see how much package loss you have elisa87
[07:06] <MTW> heroclitis: Word = word processing. libreoffice is a joke.
[07:06] <vaskaloidis> hey rob_p so any other ideas why my laptop cant connect to the internet but can ping other laptops on my network
[07:06] <vaskaloidis> or anyone else know why
[07:06] <Ben64> MTW: libreoffice works fine for word processing, its just not called "Word"
[07:06] <dr_willis> MTW:  some would say word is a joke.. but  do you have an actual support qquestion?
[07:06] <MTW> It doesn't have the same functionality, and libreoffice documents look 'weird' in Windows

[07:07] <memand> vaskaloidis: maybe your router does not have an internet connection. So it can only ping localy
[07:07] <Ben64> elisa87: you're supposed to enter your server's hostname there
[07:07] <vaskaloidis> demand i am on the same router
[07:08] <vaskaloidis> memand: i am using the same router and I have internet
[07:08] <memand> vaskaloidis: is it your router?

[07:10] <memand> vaskaloidis: maybe it has some weird firewall rules, or maybe your /etc/hosts is set up wrong
[07:10] <SeraphR> meet: Do you have your Installation CD or Live USB? boot from there and then mount your hard disk and chroot to your linux. Then you might be able to use passwd command to reset the password.
[07:10] <vaskaloidis> no i was using the wrong gateway demand thank you it works
[07:10] <memand> vaskaloidis: :)
[07:10] <Ben64> meet: reboot into recovery and reset the password

[09:44] <dr_willis> Fudge:  i would think any module  would be built as a module.. not built into the kernel . so it could be blacklisted if needed

[10:13] <dr_willis> Guest66936:  make a fstab entry for it.  and reboot.. or use the proper swapon command to activate it
[10:14] <dr_willis> !swap
[10:14] <ubottu> swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[10:16] <cousteau> "to make your system faster"?
[10:16] <Dr4k3> ubottu: Swap usage make the system faster? I dont think so
[10:16] <ubottu> Dr4k3: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[10:16] <Dr4k3> *loL*
[10:16] <cousteau> Dr4k3, it somehow does
[10:18] <cousteau> if the programs that end up on swap aren't the ones you're using mainly, the other ones might take advantage of having more RAM
[10:18] <Dr4k3> Yes, it does. if you have..lets say 500MB of RAM
[10:18] <cousteau> but if the ones on swap are the ones you're using, everything will get slow as hell
[10:19] <cousteau> also, disks today aren't that slow
[10:19] <cousteau> anyway, I tend to keep my swappiness to 10
[10:20] <belgianguy> keeps the system from "thrashing" IIRC

[10:22] <pinkpelican> How can I find the IP for my router?
[10:22] <pinkpelican> I want to change its settings.
[10:23] <jpds> pinkpelican: Well, usually it'll be the gateway of your network settings.
[10:24] <pinkpelican> I tried 192.168 which usually works, but this time it went to my modem.
[10:24] <pinkpelican> I've never seen my modem settings before.
[10:26] <iceroot> pinkpelican: "route" should show the router in the "Router" field for the default connection
[10:27] <pinkpelican> Where do I find that? Is it a terminal command?
[10:27] <catphish> are tray icons hidden by default in ubuntu?
[10:27] <iceroot> pinkpelican: yes
[10:27] <pinkpelican> What is the command?
[10:27] <iceroot> catphish: no
[10:27] <iceroot> pinkpelican: route is the command
[10:28] <catphish> iceroot: interesting, i've heard of some problems with tray icons showing up in unity, will have to investigate further

[10:28] <iceroot> catphish: i am not missing any icons (steam, hplib, skype) so there is nothing hidden by default

[10:29] <catphish> iceroot: http://ubuntu.sun.ac.za/wiki/index.php/Show_tray_icons_in_unity
[10:29] <iceroot> subdesign: if you are using imap your mails are stored on the server
[10:29] <catphish> maybe those applications whitelist themselves, or maybe i'm misunderstanding
[10:29] <iceroot> catphish: ah ok, didnt know that, thanks for the link
[10:30] <iceroot> catphish: as you see skype and hp-systray are in there, because of that i am not missing them :)
[10:30] <catphish> looks like the answer to my own question is yes, also looks like skype is one of those that is whitelisted by default

[10:35] <iceroot> dr_willis: imo
[10:36] <dr_willis> iceroot:  ive not messed with cron in years. ;)
[10:36] <JJordan> i purchased a new computer 2 days ago but i didnt buy a operating system, when i turn the computer on it just says something about dmi tool
[10:36] <dr_willis> JJordan:  so what os have you installed on it?
[10:36] <JJordan> nothing :s
[10:36] <catphish> JJordan: then you probably need to install one :)
[10:36] <dr_willis> JJordan:  test out a live cd?
[10:36] <JJordan> i was wondering would i be able to put ubuntu on it?
[10:36] <iceroot> dr_willis: yes today you dont need cron that often, most tools already have a cron-config (logrotate for example)
[10:37] <dr_willis> JJordan:  test out a live cd?   that would tell yoiu
[10:37] <catphish> looks like DMI tool is an HP BIOS thing?
[10:37] <JJordan> a live cd? sorry im not that computer savvy :[
[10:37] <dr_willis> JJordan:  ogo to ubuntu.com and get a ubuntu cd. boot it up
[10:37] <catphish> wouldn't worry about it, you just need a linux (ubuntu presumably) install cd
[10:37] <catphish> it should boot with an ubuntu cd in the drive
[10:37] <dr_willis> If you are not computer savvy... err.. why would you buy a pc with no os?
[10:38] <catphish> after that it will prompt you to install it
[10:38] <wbinvd> or in a usb pen
[10:38] <catphish> ubuntu is very easy to install
[10:38] <wbinvd> you can launch ubuntu live from a usb pendrive
[10:38] <catphish> but you will need to make or buy an install cd or usb stick
[10:38] <JJordan> thanks for the info guys
[10:38] <catphish> no problem
[10:38] <JJordan> iv got a blank 8gb cd
[10:38] <dr_willis> Huh>
[10:38] <catphish> ok, you just need to burn an ubuntu disk then (desktop, 64 bit)
[10:38] <JJordan> thats enough space to burn it onto
[10:38] <catphish> yes
[10:39] <dr_willis> an 8gb USB flash drive you mean?
[10:39] <JJordan> nope, a blank dvd disc
[10:39] <catphish> you only need a redular 4GB dvd
[10:39] <Ancient|2> Does anyone have any experience with fdisk's "move start sector" functionality on existing partitions? I'm looking to move a partitions start point from sector 63 to 2048 to fit a larger grub2 install, and I'd like to do it non-destructively if possible.
[10:39] <catphish> but that's fine
[10:39] <dr_willis> easier to put it on a flash drive. ;)
[10:39] <JJordan> my friend told me to use poweriso to burn files onto a disc
[10:39] <catphish> i find it much easier to burn a dvd personally
[10:40] <catphish> JJordan: yes, do that
[10:40] <dr_willis> i just dd the iso to flash. ;)
[10:40] <dr_willis> but im okd-skool
[10:40] <catphish> dr_willis: he has a dvd burning tool and a dvd, and likely doesn't have dd, why confuse matters
[10:40] <dr_willis> justr dont drag/drop the iso onto the cd and think it will work
[10:40] <JJordan> i cant believe i paid nearlly £1000 for a computer and didnt add a OS
[10:40] <catphish> dr_willis: he is using poweriso
[10:40] <catphish> which is fine :)
[10:41] <wbinvd> JJordan: ive did the some
[10:41] <catphish> JJordan: it's ok, ubuntu is free :)
[10:41] <dr_willis> we had someone in here last week opening the.iso file with winrar and mad at us because it was wnting  money for the full version... ;P
[10:41] <wbinvd> JJordan: but a pc without a computer and launch first time with a live cd ubuntu
[10:41] <catphish> no need to waste money getting someone else to install an OS

[10:44] <bibi23> I'm looking at the manpage of crontab, it says "will look at MAILTO if it has any reason to send mail", but what is this "any reason"?
[10:45] <subdesign> qtn: should I copy the old Thunderbird profile content into the new profile, or separate?
[10:45] <bibi23> I first tought it is when the script doesn't return 0, but apparently it's not the case, it just sent me an email while there were no error
[10:45] <soahccc> Hello! Did I get this wrong or what is the search thing in resolv.conf for? https://gist.github.com/54b37b06ae144fdcbc39
[10:45] <bibi23> by email I mean in /var/mail/user
[10:46] <dr_willis> bibi23:  i thought if there was any program output.
[10:46] <bibi23> dr_willis: ok thx
[10:46] <dr_willis> normally your cronjobs shouldent be 'chatty'  and print messages. but put things in a log.. i seem to recall from ages ago
[10:48] <bibi23> dr_willis: ok, I'm just going to redirect stdout to /dev/null, and if there is any error it's going to be prompt because it should be stderr and the crontab should send a mail I guess in that case
[10:49] <catphish> cron will email any output of a script
[10:49] <catphish> normally cron scripts are silent, but if there's a problem they should output an error and that gets emailed to the user
[10:49] <doom> which ubuntu version is good 12.04 or 12.10?
[10:49] <catphish> doom: depends on your requirements
[10:49] <catphish> 12.10 is newer, but 12.04 has long term support
[10:50] <doom> ok i need fast performance i have dell mini with atom processor with 2 gb ram
[10:50] <catphish> so for normal use, 12.10, but where the installation needs to be supported a long time without major changes / upgrades, 12.04
[10:50] <doom> which version should i choose?
[10:51] <catphish> i believe you should generally always use the latest (12.10) for features and performance
[10:51] <dr_willis> doom  for low end systems. you may wan tto use Lubuntu
[10:51] <dr_willis> !lubuntu | doom
[10:51] <ubottu> doom: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[10:51] <catphish> that's also true, a lightweight ubuntu like lubuntu or xubuntu will be faster
[10:52] <dr_willis> speed for what however?  ;) a netbook is no powerhouse

[10:57] <wbinvd> anathema_: u try with the control panel
[10:57] <wbinvd> anathema_: if u can change the bright
[10:57] <anathema_> wbinvd, works with cp, i need the hotkeys to work. Is there any way? I tried acpi_backlight=vendor but no luck
[10:58] <anathema_> wbinvd, my dmesg: asus_wmi: Backlight controlled by ACPI video driver
[10:58] <wbinvd> anathema_: you have to map the keycode of your keyboard
[10:58] <marahin> anathema_, for my case I had to enable function keys in BIOS.
[10:59] <anathema_> wbinvd, how i can do that?
[10:59] <anathema_> marahin, the other fn keys (volume works ok) function keys in my bios are enabled
[11:00] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: what do the keys that don't worek do?
[11:00] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, Brightness keys FN f5 f6 for asus
[11:00] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: what model asus?
[11:00] <anathema_>  ActionParsnip Asus K55VD (A55VD-SX406H) I7-3630M, RAM 8GB, nvidia GEFORCE 610M 2GB
[11:01] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: oh, dual GPU fun huh
[11:01] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, I have installed Bumblebee nvidia driver
[11:01] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, other fn keys works great. Is there any way to fix that?
[11:03] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: if you run:  echo 8 | sudo tee /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/ls_level
[11:03] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: does it help?
[11:05] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, no such file or directory
[11:05] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: do you have the /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop folder?
[11:06] <soahccc> What do I have to do so that ubuntu is able to resolv local hosts without that .local extension? I randomly tried several solutions but none of them seems to change anything
[11:06] <ActionParsnip> soahccc: do you mean systems on the same subnet?
[11:06] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, no there is a asus-nb-wmi folder in platform dir
[11:07] <soahccc> ActionParsnip: exactly... I have a VM for developing a specific application but I use my local database. At home it could resolve my hostname, but at work (soho) it only can find it with the .local extension
[11:08] <ActionParsnip> soahccc: you could add the resolution in /etc/hosts I guess
[11:09] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, but in the asus-nb-wmi there is no ls_level :(
[11:09] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: anything else looking suspect?
[11:10] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: i suggest you report a bug but bumblebee is far from perfect
[11:10] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: i assume you tried the usual backlight boot options
[11:11] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, I dont know. Is there a problem because i dont have the asus-laptop folder? I have tried the acpi_backlight to vendor setting...
[11:11] <soahccc> ActionParsnip: I would prefer something where I do not have to change it 2 times a day when I switch the network :)
[11:12] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: i hope you are running your web browser and media players with the nvidia gpu too. helps a lot
[11:12] <ActionParsnip> soahccc: not sure then, could ask in ##networking
[11:12] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, also I dont think that is a bumblebee problem. No I dont run them with this :P
[11:13] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: why not, you are running everything on the intel gpu, you aren't using the nvidia
[11:13] <ethang> hey guys - anyone know if they addressed that huge Java vulnerability in OpenJDK yet?
[11:13] <ActionParsnip> ethang: are there bugs reported and closed?
[11:13] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, If I dont run it with the bumblebee command is there a problem? Also the fn keys are not working with the ubuntu default driver. So i suppose that is a kernel issue
[11:13] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: yes, it will run on the intel gpu, not the nvidia
[11:13] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, How to fix that?

One last thing: I think that the brightness fn issue is kernel issue for this model and not bumblebee nvidia. because fn brightness keys are not working with the default drivers in live usb. What do you think
[11:17] <anathema_> ActionParsnip,  I have tried the acpi_osi=Linux setting. No luck. I must set it = NULL ?

[11:17] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, Yes sir. No luck too
[11:17] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: did you try the boot option: acpi_osi=Linux
[11:17] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, Yes sir acpi_osi not null but with the Linux parameter. No luck
[11:18] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, my dmesg:  asus_wmi: Backlight controlled by ACPI video driver
[11:18] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: its the dual gpu nonsense, it causes issues. ALl I can suggest is report the bug and wait.
[11:18] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, Thanks I will report. :)
[11:19] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, my dmesg ouput asus_wmi: Backlight controlled by ACPI video driver is correct?
[11:19] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: no idea mate

[12:05] <_raven> apt-get: how to remove/repair "half-installed" broken packages?
[12:06] <jrib> _raven: you should give context: 1) what packages?  2) pastebin full input/output with the relevant messages  3) what do you know about why they are in that state?
[12:08] <_raven> jrib i am on another machine right now and cannot paste for the moment but apt-get remove, purge, install does not work, -f does not work, dpkg-reconfigure, dpkg --configure does not work and i am a bit out of ideas

[12:09] <decci> I have a VM currently running that i need to move to linode.  The VM is an OpenVZ container using Proxmox as a host. The VM runs web sql and Postfix that sends newsletters. It is running Debian 5.0 32bit.  I require an exact replica on linode and will then remove the OpenVZ virtual machine once complete.
[12:09] <jrib> _raven: can't really help without you answering the 3 questions I asked.  You should be able to answer (3) without being on the machine.  For (1) and (2), can you get to the machine or can you ssh to the machine?
[12:10] <auronandace> decci: we don't support debian here, only ubuntu
[12:11] <jrib> decci: I would suggest #linode (I think they're on the OFTC network)
[12:15] <_raven> jrib how i can give you information: www.pastebin.com/zhN1QPkB
[12:15] <ActionParsnip> _raven: you could take a picture with a camera then use imageshack tyo host it
[12:15] <_raven> ActionParsnip ?
[12:16] <ActionParsnip> radopi: never mind, let me read
[12:16] <jrib> _raven: prefix your command with "LANGUAGE=C LANG=C ".  For example: LANGUAGE=C LANG=C apt-get ...

[12:21] <belgianguy> I installed the new Eclipse, and now want the Unity launcher to start the new one
[12:21] <ActionParsnip> !rootirc | Guest77314
[12:21] <ubottu> Guest77314: It's not technically our business, but we'd like to tell you that IRC'ing as root is a Very Bad Idea (tm). After all, doing anything as root when root is not needed is bad, and especially bad with software that connects to the Internet.
[12:21] <belgianguy> but the icon still points to the old one
[12:21] <belgianguy> even when I remove it, start the new one, anchor it to the launcher, it launches the old version
[12:21] <ActionParsnip> belgianguy: if you make a bash alias, does it work?
[12:22] <jrib> !java | Jjordan, there's also openjdk that you may want to consider
[12:22] <ubottu> Jjordan, there's also openjdk that you may want to consider: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[12:22] <belgianguy> ActionParsnip: I don't know what that is
[12:22] <jrib> belgianguy: how did you install the new eclipse?
[12:22] <belgianguy> from the site, not through ppa
[12:22] <jrib> belgianguy: ok, but how?
[12:22] <belgianguy> (per advice on #eclipse)
[12:23] <ActionParsnip> belgianguy: if you open the .desktop in /usr/share/applications    you can edit the Exec=  line to make it run the different binary
[12:23] <belgianguy> extract and start
[12:23] <jrib> belgianguy: where did you extract it to?  And how do you start it?
[12:23] <belgianguy> /home/myname/eclipse
[12:23] <belgianguy> and just double click the binary
[12:24] <jrib> belgianguy: my guess is that it's because eclipse is not in your PATH.  Try just creating a symlink to the binary in ~/bin
[12:24] <ActionParsnip> belgianguy: make a copy of the current eclipse launcher in /usr/share/applications   and edit the Exec=  line. This will mean updates do not change your efforts, then drag it to the Unity launcher
[12:25] <belgianguy> ah k, will try those suggestions
[12:25] <belgianguy> thanks!
[12:25] <jrib> belgianguy: you can also check the .desktop file as ActionParsnip points out, but I'd suggest looking in ~/.local/share/applications since I believe that's where user .desktop files get created

[12:31] <plzhelp> (i'm using 11.04 natty narwhal)
[12:31] <Evon> I tried to install Ubuntu 12.10 on my desktop computer and I've had quite a bit of problems with it. I suspect it has something to do with my Nvidia GTX460 video card because the graphics gets rendered all weird.  I also get a lot of errors when trying to install stuff with the software centre.  I've decided to install 12.04 instead (it's installing right  now).  I was just wondering if ubuntu inherently has problems wi
[12:31] <Evon> th nvidia cards?
[12:32] <jrib> Baribal: sudo apt-get install PACKAGE
[12:32] <jrib> !11.04 | plzhelp
[12:32] <ubottu> plzhelp: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) was the fourteenth release of Ubuntu. Desktop support ended on October 28, 2012. See !upgrade, !lts and !eol for more details.
[12:32] <Baribal> install handles upgrades too? Wow, didn't know that... Thanks, jrib
[12:33] <jrib> plzhelp: you should upgrade to a supported release.  11.04 is no longer supported which may mean the repositories aren't available where they were before and may explain your issues

[12:44] <ActionParsnip> negi: tell you what?
[12:44] <jrib> AxonetBE: what does « apt-cache policy PACKAGE » return at the moment?

[12:47] <ubottu> satdav_: A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA?

[12:48] <satdav_> how do i update the one on the ubottu repo
[12:49] <AxonetBE> jrib: but that is to pin versions, the old version was never installed on that server
[12:49] <ActionParsnip> satdav_: you don't, that is the job of the repo maintainers
[12:49] <satdav_> do you know who they are
[12:49] <jrib> AxonetBE: yes, do you not want to pin versions?  What do you want to do then?
[12:50] <AxonetBE> install a previous version of the package
[12:50] <Evon> what's the terminal command to exit x?
[12:50] <ActionParsnip> satdav_: the ppas will probably have a laterversion

[12:55] <AxonetBE> jrib: I will give you the situation. We have a production server running libzmq-dev 2.2.0-1chl1~lucid1 installed from repo https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/zeromq/. Now if we boot are staging server it use the same repo but since zeromq is updated it installs version 3.2.2-1chl1~lucid1 of  libzmq-dev, but one Ruby gem that depends on zeromq does not work with the latest version. So I want to install version libzmq-dev 2.2.0-1chl1~lucid
[12:56] <jrib> AxonetBE: if the repository has been updated to 3.2.2 then you need to grab the source package for the old version and build debs for that version (or just grab the debs in /var/cache/apt/archives/ on your production server)
[12:56] <jrib> AxonetBE: actually you have the debs there on the launchpad page.  Afaik, you won't be able to get that old version through apt with that repo anymore
[12:57] <AxonetBE> jrib: ok that is sad, because we use chef to automatize this process.
[12:57] <jrib> AxonetBE: you could make your own ppa
[12:59] <AxonetBE> jrib: can it be also in another folder then /var/cache/apt/archives/ becaude that is empty on production

[13:59] <stigrancazzi> ciao!!
[13:59] <PatrickDickey> mokujin you simply run the Windows DVD and install it. If you want to dual-boot, you'll have to set things up before hand. Then you'll have to run a Live CD to get GRUB working again.
[14:00] <jrib> jonascj: I guess first thing to do is check what the environment looks like (does it mention anything about the keyring) after you first login.  Then do « gnome-keyring-deamon --start » which should just output the info for the already-running keyring-deamon.  Then starting your app with that info in the environment and see if anything changes
[14:00] <imacake> I'd need some little help with networking. Tried setting up qemu TAP/TUN things and now 'eth0' isnt even there.
[14:00] <jrib> jonascj: then maybe killing the existing one and starting a new one and see if the apps like it better.  That should give you some sort of info about what's happening anyway

[14:11] <AtuM> The kernel updates install, but then fail at post-install with mkinitramfs..
[14:11] <PatrickDickey> AtuM go into Software Sources and uncheck that. I can attest personally, that sometimes the kernel updates aren't ready in Proposed, and you get this problem.
[14:11] <AtuM> oh... let me check the "proposed updates" stat...
[14:12] <jonascj> jrib: I disappeared again not (after similar to 2 minutes of being logged in). But the envvars of course stay

[14:12] <jonascj> jrib: *it disappeared (not I)
[14:12] <jrib> jonascj: so that must be the issue, it comes back as something new and your environment doesn't know about. Now as to why it died, I have no idea
[14:13] <jrib> jonascj: maybe check ~/.xsession-errors
[14:14] <PatrickDickey> AtuM sudo dpkg --remove --pending will get rid of the updates that are failing. After that, and after you've verfied that Proposed are not checked in Software Sources, you should be able to update and upgrade again.
[14:15] <jonascj> jrib: .xsession-erros is empty (warnings appear if I try to include gnome-settings-daemon in the start up scripts of course, but right now I'm just trying to start things manually after login to get a better idea of what is going on)
[14:15] <AtuM> PatrickDickey, precise-proposed is disabled
[14:15] <jonascj> jrib: but the keyring could be killed again for various reasons I guess. If it is no longer needed (after all no other gnome-stuff is being launched)
[14:17] <PatrickDickey> AtuM try the command that I just gave you then. And then try your sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get dist-upgrade (or sudo apt-get upgrade)

[14:29] <AtuM> PatrickDickey, I should fix it...
[14:29] <imacake> jonascj: file doesnt exist. NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf does instead ?
[14:29] <llutz> imacake: thats why networkmanager doesn't manage this device. either remove it from /etc/network/interfaces or configure it there

[14:31] <jonascj> imacake: also do what llutz says - remove it the eth0 line from /etc/network/interfaces - i didn't realize this because you said in words that eth0 wasn't there (imacake	eth0 was not there, only lo and br0 )
[14:31] <usr13> AtuM: PatrickDickey What about Upgrading Using the Alternate CD/DVD ?

[14:32] <imacake> now i removed eth0
[14:32] <imacake> how do i restart networkmanager ?
[14:32] <PatrickDickey> AtuM and usr13 if AtuM wants to upgrade, that would be a good plan. I think what his issue is right now, is that he's trying to update to the latest kernel available for 12.04, and it's failing.
[14:33] <usr13> imacake: service NetworkManager restart
[14:33] <imacake> NetworkManager: unrecognized service.
[14:33] <jonascj> imacake: that's probably because a vpn guide you followed or the like specified you to bridge something  to eth0. So removing eth0 lines from /etc/network/interfaces might break some vpn setup or the like
[14:33] <usr13> imacake: service network-manager restart
[14:33] <PatrickDickey> AtuM Was that the /home encryption that you were talking about? That shouldn't affect updates. However full-drive encryption might.

[14:37] <imacake> http://toast.djw.org.uk/qemu.html this guide
[14:37] <PatrickDickey> imacake try checking this link please http://askubuntu.com/questions/71159/network-manager-says-device-not-managed
[14:38] <remd> export LANG="en_US.utf8"
[14:38] <remd> export LANGUAGE="en_US.utf8"
[14:38] <remd> export LC_ALL="en_US.utf8"
[14:38] <jrib> remd: was anything there before?
[14:38] <remd> yep same with DE...
[14:38] <jrib> remd: you should just get rid of all that
[14:38] <remd> I overlooked this file until now.I was in /etc/default/locale ~/.Profile /etc/environement etc.. but not that one..
[14:39] <remd> anyway its working how I want it to now :)
[14:39] <jrib> remd: if you get rid of those lines, the setting from /etc/default/locale shouldn't be overridden
[14:39] <remd> oh ok thx for the tip
[14:39] <usr13> remd: I have a much different /etc/profile in my 10.04 system.
[14:40] <jonascj> jrib: now I get those dbus-erros. Did you have a suggestion as how to start digging into those? (gnome-settings-daemon:1996) WARNING **: Unable to register client: GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The Name org.gnome.SessionManager was not provided by any service files"
[14:40] <remd> either way they both shoe en_US now
[14:40] <usr13> remd: Well, if it works, it works.
[14:40] <jrib> jonascj: well you probably don't have a session manager :P  You could start gnome-session if you want I guess.  I don't bother with this
[14:40] <jrib> remd: the reason I suggest removing those lines is because a few months from now when you go to change your locale you will again be stumped :)
[14:41] <PatrickDickey> imacake: two questions. 1. Did you follow that guide exactly, including the IP Addresses? 2. Before you followed the guide, was your IP Address a 192.168.1.x number?
[14:41] <imacake> PatrickDickey: both yes.
[14:41] <remd> yea, after the hrs I spent now, I'm not sure I'll forget this any time soon! :) but good tip, I'll go ahead and comment it in the profile file..
[14:41] <remd> so the default locale settings apply
[14:42] <imacake> i read that askubuntu thing, and i got a "connection estabilished" popup.
[14:42] <imacake> pinging google, however, fails.
[14:42] <PatrickDickey> imacake, what does ifconfig eth0 show for an IP address?
[14:42] <jonascj> jrib: to be honest I didn't even know there was such a thing as the dbus untill I tried xmonad and got all these errors. So would you suggest I just forget all about dbus and the session-manager (which might be the reason for the dbus warnings)?
[14:43] <usr13> remd: I have a 10.04 system with /etc/profile and it looks like this:  http://pastebin.com/4Whergqx
[14:43] <imacake> 192.168.2.100, the one as always, so thats good.
[14:43] <PatrickDickey> Ahhh. We have a winner. You said you followed the guide exactly, including the IP Addresses they list, correct imacake?
[14:43] <imacake> yes
[14:43] <jrib> jonascj: if the system behaves as you want without it, then I wouldn't bother
[14:44] <imacake> I dont know why br0 should be killing my normal network...
[14:44] <PatrickDickey> imacakeYou need to change their IP Addresses from 192.168.1.x to 192.168.2.x because your network is on 192.168.2.x.
[14:44] <imacake> oh.
[14:46] <PatrickDickey> and imacake you want to make sure that the IP Addresses you use are not ones that are in use on your network.  Typically your router is either 192.168.2.1 or 192.168.2.254.
[14:46] <imacake> changed. Still I don't know how br0 relates to eth0... and pinging google still fails.
[14:46] <jrib> jonascj: the one nice thing you may miss is that when you exit using the session manager it might warn you: hey you haven't saved your doc in gedit!.  Without it, well goodbye doc :)
[14:46] <usr13> imacake: can you ping 8.8.8.8 ?
[14:46] <imacake> my router is 102.168.2.1, and this one is not in use, im sure of that. (the .100 one).
[14:47] <PatrickDickey> br0 is bridge connection 0, eth0 is the first ethernet that your computer has (most likely the only one).  Everything in the computer world starts with 0 and works up from there.
[14:47] <imacake> ping 8.8.8.8 destination host unreachable.
[14:47] <usr13> imacake: what is the IP of your router?
[14:47] <PatrickDickey> imacake you need to choose something else for br0 than .100. That's what your eth0 is using.
[14:47] <imacake> PatrickDickey: I'm a C/C++ programmer.
[14:48] <imacake> (well, hobbyist)
=== gres_ is now known as akSeya
[14:49] <imacake> PatrickDickey: i think i start understanding now...
[14:50] <PatrickDickey> imacake the way they relate is like this. Your QEMU is using virtual network cards. They have to connect to the physical network somehow. A bridge between them (br0) and eth0 is the way to do that.
[14:50] <hilo> hello. Is there a way to see what processes have memory which is swapped out? I am trying to see what's happening with my system. It has 16GiB physical RAM, is only using about 5, yet over 1.5GiB of swap is in use. Swappiness is set to 1.
[14:50] <usr13> hilo: htop
[14:50] <PatrickDickey> It's one way of doing that, I mean. You might be better off using NAT. But I'm not sure how that all works with QEMU. I typically use virtualbox, and on one computer, I have to use NAT, and on the other, bridged.
[14:51] <imacake> and br0 is that virtual network. and br0 acts like another dhcp client to my physical router ?
[14:51] <hilo> usr13, how can I see which processes are swapped out
[14:51] <hilo> usr13, I got that info from htop
[14:51] <usr13> hilo: http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/free-mem.html
[14:51] <PatrickDickey> imacake sort of. it's a bridge connecting them. So your router thinks the virtual cards are physical cards.
[14:52] <imacake> cool.
[14:52] <sogeking99> Hey guys, can any one help me install ms-sys please. Step 1, unpack the archive:tar -xzvf ms-sys*.tgz Step 2, compile: cd ms-sys make Step 3, become root and install su (and give password) make install
[14:52] <sogeking99> I extracted the file with right click extract here. Then typed make from the folder in the terminal. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1541720/ what did I do wrong? This is the terminal output
[14:53] <llutz>  sogeking99 sudo apt-get install gettext
[14:54] <PatrickDickey> sogeking99 is there an INSTALL file or a README file in the directory? If so, that should give you the exact steps for compiling and installing.
[14:54] <imacake> PatrickDickey: So i killed the entire br0 block, do i need to restart the machine ?
[14:54] <fas> I'm having trouble mounting an external usb drive
[14:54] <jonascj> jrib: any notion of what applications might rely on this dbus?
[14:54] <hilo> usr13, I have plenty of free memory. And I understand the linux file cache. But according to htop, even including the file cache, only about 8GiB of the physical memory is in use.
[14:54] <sogeking99> llutz, What does this do?
[14:54] <fas> mount /dev/sdd1 tells me it's not found in fstab or mtab
[14:54] <jrib> jonascj: you mean on the session manager?
[14:55] <llutz> sogeking99: installs the package containing msgfmt
[14:55] <fas> How can I mount this drive?
[14:55]  * PatrickDickey is off to bed...  Night all (moring all really).
[14:55] <hilo> fas, you have to specify an empty directory to mount to
[14:55] <fas> I did
[14:55] <sogeking99> PatrickDickey, Yeah those steps I pasted are the install instructions.
[14:55] <fas> Same error
[14:55] <sogeking99> llutz, Sorry but I'm not sure what that is?
[14:55] <fas> mount -o /dev/sdd1 /mnt/mountpoint

[14:56] <llutz> sogeking99: have you even read your own paste and seen those lines like "make: msgfmt: Command not found"

[14:57] <jrib> c2tarun: they're still available (so people can upgrade) but moved to a different place.  See ubottu
[14:57] <ActionParsnip> fas: you add -o for adding extra mount options

[14:59] <subdesign> anybody developing here? apt cant find mysql-admin :/

[14:59] <subdesign> ah
[15:00] <subdesign> thanks
[15:00] <jrib> jonascj: it just means you don't have a session manager running.  If you run gnome-session, that should go away

[15:20] <Unicorn001> (windows 8 - windows boot manager)
[15:20] <MonkeyDust> Unicorn001  ask in ##windows how to do something in windows
[15:20] <_helios_> ur0pl, you have not set a unix password yet
[15:20] <BlueEagle> !sudo | ur0pl
[15:20] <ubottu> ur0pl: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[15:20] <_helios_> ur0pl, type sudo su then enter your 111 then type passwd and set a new password
[15:21] <usr13> p1l0t_: Ctrl-Alt Right or Left arrow
[15:21] <_helios_> ur0pl then you can su and use the new password you set for the unix account.
[15:21] <p1l0t> usr13: Yes that's nice!
[15:22] <_helios_> ur0pl, do you understand?
[15:22] <BlueEagle> ur0pl: You don't need to enable the root account, you know. sudo -s does the same as su -
[15:23] <ActionParsnip> ur0pl: use:  sudo -i
[15:23] <jrib> ur0pl, BlueEagle: sudo -i will sanitize the environment like su - does
[15:23] <ActionParsnip> ur0pl: su -   would need a root password, whichj doesn't exist
[15:23] <_helios_> ur0pl, I gave you instructions to make a root password.
[15:24] <ur0pl> ok thanks
[15:24] <ur0pl> i did it

[15:25] <ur0pl> byobu
[15:25] <ur0pl> that is what i use
[15:25] <ur0pl> is that better than tmux?

[15:49] <AridDecay> Guest70134: Already done that =P I'm not new to linux.

[15:50] <AridDecay> No, no, it's fine though
[15:50] <JuJuBee> My ltsp server is an NIS client on my LAN.  I used nfs to mount /home on the ltsp server.  my users can log into a ltsp client computer but their /home is not mounting properly .  They get a message that "Transport endpoint is not connected"
[15:50] <AridDecay> Specially with a simple problem like mine, i'd assume I was too.

[15:52] <computer> Hi. Half my biscuit broke off and is somewhere at the bottom of the cup? Any ideas what to do? Is this the right channel??
[15:53] <AridDecay> Also. Is there an easy way to shy away from this DE and install something godly like fluxbox? New to the newer versions of Ubuntu. I'm from the gnome kind of time.. It's all so different

[15:57] <ncsquid22> try this....ping yahoo.com and see if its resolves the IP and you can ping it
[15:57] <computer> QjackCtl is an audio interface?
[15:58] <ncsquid22> yea but if you look at the error....the interface seems to connect to a server ....perhaps to download artist info etc...who knows...anyway check your network connection
[15:58] <llutz> ncsquid22: connect a "server socket"

[16:03] <mbeierl_> computer: did you change any of the jackd settings?  I've had that issue when jackd was unable to start up due to unrealistic values
[16:03] <mbeierl_> computer, you might have better luck asking in #opensourcemusicians as there are more people there that are familiar with the ins and outs of audio
[16:03] <ncsquid22> computer perhaps you should try this....."watch -n 1 netstat -tupn" when you try to start your audio application....and see what happens.....you can also try "sudo ss -nap"

[16:08] <kieron-desktop> i need your opinion
[16:08] <kieron-desktop> i have a computer with the following specs
[16:09] <MonkeyDust> kieron-desktop  no opinions here, please
[16:10] <kieron-desktop> 80gb hdd ,512mb ddr memory ,pentium 4 2.53ghz and a dmx 6fire 24/96 soundcard with front panel
[16:10] <kieron-desktop> i need to know what kernel is best for it
[16:10] <Pici> kieron-desktop: Any.
[16:10] <kieron-desktop> its for my friends music studio
[16:11] <AridDecay> I am still having my issue with my logitech MX-910 mouse. I have done a synaptic update twice and restarted. I cannot find information on a driver for my mouse, do any of you have any information on using it in Linux?
[16:11] <JannePeltonen> kieron-desktop: I'd go with xubuntu since it's not the fastest computer
[16:11] <DJFUCHACK3R> http://www.whitehouse.gov/videos/2013/January/011613_PlantoReduceGunViolence_HD.mp4
[16:11] <jarlath> I have had a problem where choosing 'Shut Down' or 'Restart' only brought me to the Greeter, and I couldn't do it from there either. Now I've discovered that if I disable networking this problem goes away. Does that stand out for anyone? I'm happy to re-install, but if it's because of an update I'll only end up with the same issue again.
[16:11] <MonkeyDust> kieron-desktop  3.5.0-19 is the current kernel in ubuntu
[16:11] <kieron-desktop> i have told him to upgrade the memory
[16:12] <kieron-desktop> is it good for music production
[16:12] <LeMike> Hello. I like to log the servers load with "top -b -i -n 20" but i only want to have those processes that have a cpu load of higher than 50%. is that possible?
[16:12] <DJFUCHACK3R> I CAN TAKE THE BUS IF I HAVE TO.
[16:12] <kieron-desktop> cos ive gone on this page here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/RealTimeKernel
[16:13] <kieron-desktop> and i would prefer to use one from their

[16:14] <meet> my login keyring is not getting unlocked on startup. i tried removing the keyring password and set it to blank but still the problem persists. any solution?
[16:14] <kieron-desktop> so which one should i pick
[16:14] <kieron-desktop> the soft kernel or the hard kernel
[16:15] <xangua> meet: do you have automatic login enabled¿
[16:15] <xangua> kieron-desktop: soft or hard kernel¿¿¿ what are you talking about¿
[16:15] <meet> xangua: no. but i have set login without password.
[16:15] <kieron-desktop> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/RealTimeKernel
[16:15] <ActionParsnip> LeMike: you will need grep and sort
[16:17] <AridDecay> Does no one have any information on running a wireless mouse in Ubuntu?
[16:17] <AridDecay> =/
[16:17] <kieron-desktop> hallo
[16:18] <Sven_vB> does anyone have an idea how to make SSH give up if RSA key auth failed, instead of asking me for a password, blocking execution of my script?
[16:18] <xangua> meet: that's always such a bad idea :) please use a password
[16:18] <meet> AridDecay: mine worked automatically.
[16:18] <kieron-desktop> so
[16:18] <kieron-desktop> what kernel do i use
[16:19] <kieron-desktop> bear in mind my system is 32bit
[16:19] <ljxkey> hello,everyone ,who has some time to have a talk
[16:19] <meet> xangua.. but why cannot it unlock? because I don't really need a password. and its annoying to put password everytime.
[16:19] <xangua> kieron-desktop: you were already told that wich such low spec you should try Xubuntu, or even Lubuntu
[16:19] <kieron-desktop> memory i will be upgrading
[16:19] <ActionParsnip> ljxkey: this is pur support, talk is in #ubuntu-offtopic
[16:19] <AridDecay> meet: Odd. My Logitech mouse (with the unifying adapter, the small one) doesn't want to work. But it is seen by lsusb
[16:19] <AridDecay> Is there a logitech diver i'm missing perchance?
[16:20] <Sven_vB> also, in cases where RSA key auth succeeded, i'd like to be able to pass data on stdin, which precludes my otherwise working use of DISPLAY= </dev/null setsid ssh
[16:20] <meet> AridDecay: i have a logitech m225 mouse. no problems. did you perform the first update ?
[16:20] <kieron-desktop> so ... what they dont do a 32bit realtime kernel
[16:20] <MonkeyDust> kieron-desktop  best use the normal kernel that ubuntu uses by default
[16:20] <AridDecay> meet: I did perform the first update. Updated quite a bit
[16:20] <ActionParsnip> LeMike: you can use:  top -c 1    and pipe to:  sort -k 4    assuming colomn 3 is the cpu use colomn

[16:37] <AridDecay> I'm from the times of like, Gnome in Ubuntu. What use would Ubuntu one be for me? I've read about it, but don't really understand it's use
[16:38] <usr13> tata: sudo apt-get install mplayer ?
[16:38] <xangua> AridDecay: Ubuntu still uses gnome
[16:38] <AridDecay> Isn't it some unity DE now?
[16:38] <AridDecay> I figured it was something Ubuntu developed itself.
[16:38] <AridDecay> Certaintly looks the part
[16:38] <MonkeyDust> AridDecay  unity is a layer on top of gnome
[16:38] <AridDecay> Interesting
[16:39] <AridDecay> Is it possible to just remove Unity alltogether?
[16:39] <dcherniv> AridDecay, just install debian
[16:39] <tata> alsamixer is corect, why sudo apt...
[16:39] <MonkeyDust> AridDecay  install a different DE, logout, select DE, login
[16:39] <AridDecay> dcherniv: Oh good lord
[16:39] <usr13> AridDecay: There are other Desktop Environments.  xubuntu lubuntu
[16:39] <AridDecay> You've got to be kidding =P
[16:39] <AridDecay> I know about other DE's
[16:39] <tata> problem is with MP4
[16:39] <AridDecay> But I would like straight gnome
[16:39] <dcherniv> AridDecay, whats the problem with debian
[16:39] <AridDecay> Is that not possible anymore? If so, Fluxbox is my go to then.
[16:39] <MonkeyDust> AridDecay  then there's gnome-shell

[16:45] <MonkeyDust> user_  fastest and easiest would be a fresh install, after backup
[16:45] <Duzzy> "iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.0/24 -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT" is the command to accept my internal ip and "iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j DROP" is to drop the rest, but obviously that first line doesnt do the trick

[16:57] <usr13> computer_: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1969862 ?
[16:57] <truerocker_redhe> well i just tried installing lightspark instead of flash since the new releases of flash don't have 64 bit integration and ran across error message 126 along with a stream of other errors reffering to unknown parameters
[16:57] <custom_> whover, I created a iso using remastersys and as I try to install from it the installation does not take place
[16:57] <computer_> Thanks :). I'll have a look.
[16:58] <truerocker_redhe> what is error message 126?
[16:59] <usr13> custom_: md5sum it and google the output
[16:59] <hilo> I am having what seems like a permissions issue with my samba shares. The permissions are set correctly on the directories and files which I confirmed by accessing and writing them when logged onto the server locally (and issuing all commands as the user samba uses). When I mount the share from Windows XP, everything works as expected (I can read/write). If I mount the share using Ubuntu 10.04, I can read and write anything that is already existing, but certai
[16:59] <hilo> n directories I can not create new items in. The affected directories have r-xrwx--- permissions (but the samba user is in the group and is not the owner).
[16:59] <custom_> how to do md5sum?
[16:59] <whoever> custom_: why use ubiquity when most distros have  that option when you mount the image and run it

[17:02] <ronnie_> how to make a full customize  dvd from my current ubuntu os ? anyone can help me?
[17:02] <bazhang> !remaster | ronnie_
[17:02] <ubottu> ronnie_: Interested in remastering the Ubuntu !LiveCD or !Alternate installer? See: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallCDCustomization - Or use tools such as http://uck.sourceforge.net/ or http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/DRU_Disc_Remastering_Utility
[17:03] <bazhang> ronnie_, unless you mean clone. you can make a disk image from the Disks app
[17:04] <truerocker_redhe> i take it that wasn't a question worth answering?
[17:04] <usr13> bazhang: He must be looking for something like kickstart (from Fedora).
[17:04] <bazhang> truerocker_redhe, overwrite the partition with a fresh install
[17:05] <ronnie_> i want a clone disk which i install a second device any time. my current os ubuntu 12.10 64 bit.i need a full dvd that i am using now.
[17:05] <truerocker_redhe> how would i go about that?
[17:05] <bazhang> truerocker_redhe, the installer will do it for you
[17:05] <usr13> bazhang: ronnie_ https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/installation-guide/i386/automatic-install.html
[17:05] <bazhang> ronnie_, so look into the Disks app I just told you about
[17:06] <truerocker_redhe> bear with me here, i'm quite capable computer wise but new to ubuntu. where's the installer?
[17:06] <bazhang> usr13, I dont have the issue, no need to link me
[17:06] <bazhang> truerocker_redhe, on the live dvd/usb
[17:06] <custom_> hello
[17:06] <usr13> bazhang: FYI
[17:06] <custom_> here is the output of md5sum   "24d6a70ad7fcd74cf1873d2797a3b2c1  custom-dist.iso"
[17:07] <usr13> custom_: google it
[17:07] <truerocker_redhe> i don't have the cd anymore, recently moved, where can i get a copy or a flashdrive loadable version?
[17:07] <usr13> custom_: no match.  What is "custom-dist.iso" ?
[17:07] <custom_> you mean search only the key
[17:08] <custom_> custom-dist.iso is the I created using remastersys
[17:08] <usr13> custom_: Yes.  but What is "custom-dist.iso" ?
[17:08] <usr13> custom_: Oh, well a checksum will do you no good.
[17:08] <usr13> custom_: It is unique
[17:09] <custom_> Now earlier whenever I created this iso an icon was shown on the desktop to install the OS
[17:09] <truerocker_redhe> anyone? know a link to download a fresh exacutable version of ubuntu to flash drive?
[17:09] <custom_> Now in this iso I do not get that icon
[17:10] <usr13> custom_: And your question is _________________?
[17:10] <auronandace> truerocker_redhe: dd the iso to a usb
[17:10] <ActionParsnip> truerocker_redhe: use unetbootin
[17:11] <truerocker_redhe> whats unetbootin?
[17:11] <custom_> So I checked my earlier versions it was trying to execute "ubiquity --desktop %k gtk_ui"
[17:11] <KylieBrooks> hello
[17:11] <KylieBrooks> have an isue
[17:11] <KylieBrooks> im trying to install kvirc
[17:11] <custom_> usr13: my question how to get that installer icon back
[17:11] <KylieBrooks> but
[17:11] <ActionParsnip> custom_: did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
[17:11] <xibalba> anyone know of a linux storage appliance (like freenas) that is highly available, redundant, and dedup's?
[17:11] <KylieBrooks> software center seems to be slow
[17:11] <ActionParsnip> KylieBrooks: it is
[17:12] <KylieBrooks> and appears freezing at times
[17:12] <usr13> ActionParsnip: It is custom-dist.iso
[17:12] <KylieBrooks> ActionParsnip: wat
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> usr13: oh
[17:12] <usr13> ActionParsnip: remastered...
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> KylieBrooks: software centre is slow
[17:12] <custom_> ActionParsnip: I am having a working version of 12.04 on my machine and I want to create a customised version of it
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> usr13: gotcha
[17:12] <truerocker_redhe> how do i use "unetbootin"?
[17:12] <custom_> So i use remastersys for it
[17:12] <KylieBrooks> how do i make it faster ActionParsnip
[17:12] <ActionParsnip> custom_: then add the shortcut to the ubuntu user's desktop
[17:13] <usr13> custom_:  https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/installation-guide/i386/automatic-install.html
[17:13] <ActionParsnip> KylieBrooks: i don't use is, you could try the lubuntu software centre
[17:13] <KylieBrooks> ActionParsnip: i dont use that

[17:18] <ZenMasta_> why would someone use ln -sf command vs a2enmod ?
[17:18] <KylieBrooks> ZenMasta_: different commands
[17:18] <llutz> ZenMasta_: because lots of guys just don't know about the a2en.... commands
[17:18] <ZenMasta_> KylieBrooks if the goal is to enable a mod wouldn't you just use a2en?
[17:19] <KylieBrooks> ZenMasta_: if u dont mind removing the colour from urr message
[17:19] <custom_> usr13: any idea why this installer shortcut is not shown on desktop?
[17:20] <ZenMasta_> llutz I see. just wondering as I figured out a problem I had was due to a mod not being enabled and I'd never seen the ln -sf method before wasn't sure if it was special :)
[17:20] <jhutchins> ZenMasta_: Using ln does the same thing as the scripts do.
[17:20] <ZenMasta_> jhutchins cool thanks for confirming
[17:20] <computer> Ubuntu Studio User. Hi. Log in as root? Tried ctrl+alt+f3. (Log in from command line root+my password) but didn't work?

[17:22] <computer> Ok. Thanks.
[17:22] <meet> does apt-fast really work?
[17:28] <lastleo85> my ubuntu hangs

[17:28] <KylieBrooks> um
[17:28] <alexandr> hellp
[17:28] <ActionParsnip> lastleo85: have you tested your RAM
[17:30] <machicola> is there any ubuntu software that allows adding/editing of text boxes for .PDF , like the premium acrobat versions

[17:35] <zoktar> What is in charge of the bottom right notifications?, it has glitched out and always shows up blank white. ubuntu 12.10 unity-compiz. Top right notifications are not affected.

[17:35] <koolaidmini> Hello! :)
[17:36] <koolaidmini> I need help with my usb stick.
[17:36] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: what does the stick do?
[17:36] <koolaidmini> Whenever I boot, it will say syslinux 4.06 2012-10-23 when I try to boot.
[17:37] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
[17:37] <koolaidmini> Elaborate?
[17:37] <ActionParsnip> !md5 | koolaidmini
[17:37] <ubottu> koolaidmini: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[17:37] <koolaidmini> What if its corrupted?
[17:37] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: then you will need top redownload it
[17:38] <koolaidmini> Why would it become corrupted?
[17:38] <rioko_> i've gotten my hands on a scrolling marquee, can anyone direct to somewhere where i can program it in python or to somewhere that deals with hardware?
[17:38] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: because the internet is not a very reliable network (in the grand scheme of things)
[17:39] <koolaidmini> Hahah, fair enough.
[17:39] <hilo> When a samba share is mounted in nautilus, where in the filesystem is it actually mounted to
[17:39] <koolaidmini> So is that the root of my issue most likely?
[17:39] <ActionParsnip> hilo: /run/$user/gvfs
[17:39] <ActionParsnip> hilo: the 'mount' command will show you
[17:39] <hilo> ActionParsnip, thanks
[17:40] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: using torrents helps as the torrent protocol adds extra checks
[17:40] <koolaidmini> where do I torrent it from?
[17:40] <ActionParsnip> !torrents
[17:40] <ubottu> Quantal can be torrented from http://torrent.ubuntu.com/simple/quantal/desktop/ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent or http://torrent.ubuntu.com/simple/quantal/server/ubuntu-12.10-server-amd64.iso.torrent depending on your needs.

[17:43] <billybob000> i need help with dns... i configured /etc/resolv.conf with the dns server on my network, i can ping it and everything, but it wont resolve names
[17:44] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: how did you put the ISO on the USB
[17:44] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: in fuure, please MD5 test before using ISO files
[17:44] <billybob000> on another PC using the same DNS server, it works fine

[17:44] <drahti> hi
[17:45] <koolaidmini> I tried installing it with UUI so it was bootable, didnt work, so i tried jus tthe iso. didnt work,
[17:45] <ActionParsnip> billybob000: can the system ping the DNS server?
[17:45] <billybob000> ActionParsnip: yes
[17:46] <billybob000> i have a windows PC that uses the same DNS server and it works fine
[17:46] <billybob000> but using it on ubuntu server, it doesnt work

[17:47] <Discordian93> I need some help for a friend new to linux, his internet doesn't work
[17:47] <Discordian93> he's using ubuntu 12.04 and a webstar atlanta scientefic dpc 2100 series router
[17:48] <koolaidmini> Sorry, my laptop died, So I tried installing it so it is bootable with UUI,
[17:48] <koolaidmini> didnt work.
[17:48] <koolaidmini> Tried just dropping the iso, didnt work either.
[17:48] <ActionParsnip> billybob000: can you ping the DNS under Ubuntu ok?
[17:48] <jhutchins> Discordian93: Router should be irrelevant.
[17:48] <Discordian93> I know
[17:48] <billybob000> ActionParsnip: yes, i can ping the dns server just fine
[17:48] <Discordian93> but it doesn't work, for some reasonj
[17:48] <llutz> billybob000: "grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf"
[17:48] <jhutchins> !doesn't work
[17:48] <ubottu> Doesn't work is a strong statement. Does it sit on the couch all day? Does it want more money? Is it on IRC all the time? Please be specific! Examples of what doesn't work tend to help too.
[17:48] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: try unetbootin, dragging the ISO won't work
[17:48] <Discordian93> the netwrok apparently works
[17:49] <billybob000> yes, i have a name server configured in /etc/resolv.conf
[17:49] <koolaidmini> I tried unetbootin as well.
[17:49] <llutz> billybob000: the output is?
[17:49] <Discordian93> his connection appears on the network widget and appears o work succesfully
[17:49] <Discordian93> but he can't acess the internet
[17:49] <Vi> hey guys, i have been granted access to a friends server. it is hosted on ubuntu, and he is teaching me. figure out how the honeypot on port 22 works is my task. Now i wonder how it is possible that his sshd_config file still contains port 22 when you have to ssh to a different port to get in, and 22 is the honeypot?
[17:49] <Discordian93> access*
[17:49] <billybob000> nameserver 10.221.208.1
[17:49] <ActionParsnip> billybob000: can you ping other systems on the LAN ok?
[17:49] <llutz> billybob000: nmap -p53 10.221.208.1
[17:49] <jhutchins> Discordian93: Is the router providing dhcp or is it a static connection?
[17:50] <Discordian93> I don't know
[17:50] <jhutchins> Discordian93: necessary information.
[17:50] <billybob000>  llutz: i am using this same exact dns server on antoher pc (windows). it works fine
[17:50] <koolaidmini> :ActualParsnip ; I tried unetbootin. Did not work either. stuck at the same screen.
[17:50] <Discordian93> How do you check taht?
[17:50] <billybob000> it must be something specific to ubuntu server
[17:50] <jhutchins> Discordian93: Did he set the address manually, or did it get it automatically from the router?
[17:51] <ActionParsnip> koolaidmini: or the 1 2 3 app from pendrivelinux
[17:51] <Discordian93> automatically
[17:51] <koolaidmini> Tried that too..
[17:51] <jhutchins> Discordian93: If he can ping the router but can't ping 8.8.8.8 he doesn't have the router set as his gateway.
[17:51] <Discordian93> and how would he set the router as his gateway?
[17:51] <koolaidmini> Did not work.

[18:11] <Traumatizer> Is there any way I can configure ubuntu to use dumb quotes(" " ) in stead of smart ones(¨ ¨)
[18:12] <truerocker_redhe> i have it downloaded, don't have a usb or dvd at moment with enough space, anyway around that
[18:12] <Klaypex> well unboot can install directly on hard drive. from windows ofc

[18:14] <Klaypex> oh. well. try unboot. he can install OS on some partition/hard if u hawe free one
[18:14] <Klaypex> i think he still can

[18:14] <xentity1x> Hi, my tty screens are black when I switch to them
[18:15] <Klaypex> but best is to install it on usb and then install on hdd

[18:16] <sardior> Dolphin seems to work fine.
[18:16] <rye> Traumatizer: Ubuntu is an operating system, you may be referring to some application. Where do you see the quotes changing?
[18:17] <bluebeat09> unstable wifi connection- disconnects every now and then, have to manually disable wifi network and then enable it to regain connection
[18:17] <bluebeat09> any suggestions
[18:17] <bluebeat09> please...
[18:17] <JohnSmith82> Anyone got time to help me with the very simple bash script? should just check what number is in a file and then overwrite the number, so should be very easy to do
[18:18] <rye> bluebeat09: if youare running 802.11n network then there may be some driver issues (seen that on ath9k), downgrading to 801.11g has solved mine but YMMV
[18:19] <bluebeat09> thx rye, will try
[18:20] <Traumatizer> Rye, I know that but it applies to the whole operating system. I just can't type the dumb quotes and Qt creator only recognizes those. Not the smart ones. I suspect I need another  keyboard layout but don't know which one
[18:20] <sardior> Ok... try again later.

[18:21] <xentity1x> Hi, my tty screens are black when I switch to them. Any suggestions?
[18:21] <ActionParsnip> bluebeat09: which wifi chip?
[18:21] <Cong> lubuntu doesn't have anything to handle fonts.
[18:21] <ActionParsnip> Cong: in what way handle?
[18:21] <tion> 33
[18:22] <Cong> ActionParsnip, how do I install them? Put them in ~/fonts?
[18:22] <rye> JohnSmith82: Have you seen http://askubuntu.com/questions/168197 - maybe there is a more standar dway
[18:22] <ActionParsnip> Cong: i have a full font set in linbreoffice, they are handling well here
[18:22] <ActionParsnip> !fonts | Cong
[18:22] <ubottu> Cong: Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "ttf-mscorefonts-installer" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". For the official ubuntu font, see: http://font.ubuntu.com/
[18:23] <ActionParsnip> Cong: the font mechanism is identical across all 'buntus
[18:23] <ActionParsnip> Cong: add font in /usr/share/fonts/truetype   and run: sudo fc-cache -f -v
[18:23] <hpfrantzy5> nice, what implications does BlueSystems supporting Kubuntu have on the project? As frustrated I am with unity and ubuntu, Canonical does have the right connections
[18:23] <JohnSmith82> rye: it's when i changed to LXDE then my function keys stopped working. i've downloaded samsung-tools and my function keys work in xfce and gnome classic, but its a netbook so resources are low so LXDE were better for me
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> Cong: works in Ubuntu, kubuntu, Xubuntu, Backtrack, you name iy
[18:24] <Cong> ActionParsnip, about last time, thanks. I just went with the firmware-b43-installer.
[18:24] <Daro> lxde is greater on debian
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> Cong: cool :)
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> Daro: debian is a distro, lxde is a desktop, you can't compare the two
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> Daro: you can run lxde on debian, the statement makes no sense
[18:25] <Daro> distro is software package compilation! and ubuntu god works name him distro ubuntu, lubutu, kubuntu etc
[18:25] <ActionParsnip> Daro: then you probably meant Lubuntu is better than debian
[18:26] <Daro> always can install other evntorment writing apt-get install XXX ;)
[18:26] <Cong> I think he meant lxde + ubuntu is great.
[18:26] <ActionParsnip> Daro: i know, i've used ubuntu and linux for a long while. i'm also an ubuntu member :)

[18:27] <Daro> no im really think if debian have beter configuration for lite eventorment
[18:27] <ActionParsnip> Daro: it can, install debian cli only and then install fluxbox, slim and wicd. Super light OS, not even a DE taking up resources
[18:28] <ActionParsnip> Daro: you are forgetting the flexibility of the OS
[18:29] <dpupp> hmm
[18:29] <Daro> flexibility hmm, I can always install a third-party add-ons one does not defend me
[18:29] <dpupp> My menu bar and status bar have gone missing ... Any ideas what to try to restore them?
[18:30] <ozpy> Hi. I Installed Ubuntu  on Windows 8 (Created a partition from windows. 2) Disabled UEFI. 3) Installed using USB. 4) Instalation succesful). I rebooted my laptop and now just logs into widows 8. No grub menu
[18:30] <ActionParsnip> Daro: all 3 packages are in the official repos. how is that 3rd party?
[18:31] <Daro> is the ability to enable and added three companies
[18:32] <ActionParsnip> Daro: if you use the open source apps from the official ubuntu repos, it is not 3rd party
[18:32] <Daro> for example, do not like and I use gnash flash player is available in the repo without adding anything
[18:32] <dpupp> after getting my nvidia card drivers working, everything seems to be working fine, except my menu bar and status bar are now missing from the desktop.
[18:33] <ActionParsnip> Daro: that is nothing to do with what we are talking about
[18:33] <rye> ozpy: you may want to check that grub was indeed installed on the hard drive and not the USB drive (seen this happened in virtual machines)
[18:33] <Daro> canconical is a 3rd party company
[18:33] <Achillion> Hello all. I'm running an 12.04 as a file server + media centre + other stuff. Once in a while I come home to find it completely turned off and not responding to wake-on-lan. Logs don't show anything out of the ordinary, not even an entry showing that the system is shutting down. Any ideas what I should look for?
[18:34] <rye> dpupp: i am not sure what you are referring to as a menu bar and status bar and what desktop you are referring to
[18:34] <ActionParsnip> Daro: not when you are using Ubuntu, it is the 1st party for its users as it hosts the packages
[18:34] <Achillion> Sorry for the vagueness of my question, but I wouldn't be asking if I knew where to look
[18:34] <ozpy> rye: Can you tell me how to check that?
[18:34] <mark2013> I have an HD HomeRun Dual ATSC tuner. That connects to the Ubuntu Precise Pangolin ver. 12.04 via ethernet. My ubuntu does not handshake and MythTV finds no tuner cards. Device is working in Win7 w/o problem. MythTV has both working front/back end servers. How can I make handshake?
[18:35] <rye> ozpy: unfortunately the only way is to attempt to reinstall again and see what device is selected for grub installation - you will need to do manual partitioning for this
[18:35] <rye> Achillion: what's the setting for a power failure in BIOS, is it possible that the power simply went down?
[18:35] <dpupp> rye, in gnome i am missing the bottom desktop bar that shows running apps,  and top desktop bar where application menus are 0_0..
[18:35] <Daro> yes
[18:35] <rye> dpupp: what Ubuntu version are you running?
[18:35] <ozpy> Rye: Does it matter if the partition is not in the end or beggining?
[18:36] <ozpy> Rye: My linux partition is in the middle
[18:36] <ActionParsnip> Daro: so how is Canonical 3rd party to it's users?
[18:36] <ubuntujo> Achillion: does your cleaning lady use that socket to plug in the vacuum cleaner?
[18:36] <Daro> no for me its 3rd party
[18:36] <Daro> i using debian
[18:36] <ActionParsnip> Daro: debian isnn't supported here
[18:36] <Daro> with lxde
[18:37] <Daro> i know
[18:37] <rye> ozpy: I've seen some systems failing to boot when it was beyond first 1 GB (and that's in 2012, yeah...) but grub should be able to access its files. If grub is installed but not able to run then Windows would not boot as well
[18:37] <Achillion> rye: Other stuff in the house (and on the same multiplug extension) dont go down. For instance the router is plugged in on the same socket and I would notice if it went down. I even check the uptime.
[18:37] <Achillion> ubuntujo: :) no cleaning lady unfortunately
[18:37] <dpupp> rye, 10.04 ubuntu
[18:37] <rye> ozpy: therefore I think the bootloader was not installed in the proper location
[18:37] <ActionParsnip> Daro: and mixing ubuntu repos in debian will cause a big mess
[18:38] <Achillion> Is it safe to assume that the lack of any kind of message in the logs points to a power failure -> instant shutdown?
[18:38] <rye> dpupp: I am afraid i don't remember how to add the panels in this case
=== XenGi is now known as XenGi_
[18:39] <dpupp> rye, I was messing around in synaptic and I might have unchecked something is hould not have. >_< and then I did an apt-get autoremove ... and the next time i rebooted... gone.
[18:39] <rye> Achillion: kernel panic would also leave no traces but the system will not power down unless there is a thermal setting in bios which shuts down everything when system overheats. So if system locked up, started using all the CPU... etc
[18:39] <rye> dpupp: ah, install ubuntu-desktop package
[18:39] <dpupp> OK will try that.
[18:39] <rye> dpupp: you can run terminal with Ctrl+Alt+T
[18:39] <Daro> installing frob deb packages
[18:39] <TexNixk> Achillion : you might monitor your CPU temperature ... if it's overheating that could cause a shutdown
[18:40] <Daro> or compile from soruce code
[18:40] <jhutchins> Achillion: Power sounds likely to me.  What about putting it on a UPS?
[18:40] <Daro> ;)
[18:40] <ActionParsnip> Daro: what do you mean?
[18:40] <Achillion> rye, TexNixk: I've been stress testing using "stress" for the past 20 minutes. Temps and voltages look fine.
[18:40] <Achillion> Maybe I'll just check the cabling
[18:40] <ActionParsnip> Daro: saying randomn stuff doesn't do anything, no is it a question
[18:40] <ozpy> Rye: As a summary:  Option  (1) I should reinstall ubuntu from USB. It does not matter if the partion is in the middle. Option (2) Can I install just the bootloader with the USB?
[18:41] <ubuntujo> Achillion: PSU overheat and safety shutdown?
[18:42] <rye> ozpy: 1 - no, 2 - yes, you will need to chroot from within USB installer and install grub manually
[18:42] <tdignan> Unity is grabbing Alt+Enter. I don't see anything in ccsm under ubuntu unity plugin. It is using the keybinding to maximize windows. I want it to release control of this keybinding to applications. How can I do that?
[18:42] <rye> ActionParsnip: are you able to look at the logs of the router
[18:43] <rye> ActionParsnip: .. sorry, look at the logs of the router to see when the link went down
[18:43] <ActionParsnip> rye: wrong target?
[18:43] <rye> ActionParsnip: yes, sorry again
[18:43] <rye> Achillion: are you able to check router logs to see when the link went down?
[18:44] <ubuntujo> tdignan: shortcut in System settings > Keyboard ?
[18:44] <tdignan> Perhaps it's not unity but X, I don't know. How do I see what program is holding alt+enter?
[18:44] <tdignan> oh?
[18:44] <tdignan> damn, the obvious place :P
[18:44]  * rye is fairly sure we are not grabbing Alt+Enter
[18:44] <tdignan> let me take a look
[18:44] <jordy> ubuntu brasil
[18:44] <tdignan> rye: then I have no idea how to explain why alt+enter maximizes: xterm, terminator, gnome-terminal, and idea
[18:44] <jordy> alguem do brasil ae ?
[18:45] <ActionParsnip> rye: no worries dude :)
[18:45] <ozpy> Rye: So once Grub is installed manually, It won't messed up and I will access my Windows 8 partition?.. This new UEFI really made it harder to install Ubuntu

[18:46] <tdignan> rye: does it do the same for you if you hit alt+enter on an xterm?
[18:47] <rye> ozpy: unfortunately I am not able to answer this definitely, I don't have a UEFI machine. But installing grub should put a bootloader and update-grub should find another installed OS.
[18:47] <rye> tdignan: no, it is definitely not a default setting
[18:47] <tdignan> rye: :|
[18:47] <tdignan> rye: then somehow I made it happen

[18:51] <tdignan> ah, thanks
[18:51] <Achillion> rye: Yes, I saw when the link went down, which is how I know there's nothing out of the ordinary in the ubuntu logs for that time

[18:53] <tdignan> thanks a million
[18:54] <ubuntujo> tdignan: do you have the compiz setting editor GUI, or can you just change the config files?
[18:54] <tdignan> ubuntujo: i've got ccsm, i'm going to try and figure out what it is in there, but I'm comfortable editing files
[18:54] <tdignan> i'd prefer to know what it was that I did in ccsm to cause this mayhem
[18:55] <tdignan> so i'm gonna go that route
[18:55] <ubuntujo> ok :)
[18:55] <TexNixk> Achillion : while you're checking your cables ... make sure there isn't a fuzz-ball between the CPU heat sink & Fan ... might a loose piece of fuzz sometimes gets sucked into the fan stopping it ... also make powersupply vents are free

[18:57] <iamatt> they do not have inet access so i need local repo
[18:57] <tdignan> rye: agreed. ccsm is a bit more descriptive.
[18:57] <rye> faffaro: where do you see capital SCREEN ?
[18:58] <iamatt> compdoc these systems are the only ubuntu in our data center they are  research systems  i need to create the repos without ubuntu
[18:58] <disharmonic> The issue is that playback doesn't start
[18:58] <tdignan> it was the window management -> grid checkbox
[18:58] <iamatt> compdoc i am rsyncing the packages now and will sneakernet to our secure network and then how to build the index files...
[18:58] <tdignan> thanks again, this has made it possible for me to use intellij comfortably again
[18:58] <faffaro> rye, I've a startup script. But it doesn't "startup" - but when I type: ps x I see the screen written with big letters.. and I tried it manually and it didn't work until I changed
[18:58] <TexNixk> Achillion : seems strange it only happens when you are gone ... you don't have a pet that could be playing with cords ?
[18:59] <compdoc> iamatt, there may be proxy servers with caching abilites
[18:59] <compdoc> ooops, nm - thats internet releated too
[18:59] <rye> faffaro: that's ok, applications can rename their name and this just tells that it is a parent screen process

[19:26] <AceFace> i have a quick question, for those that are familiar with windows cmd, there is the "start" command which will spawn the command you specify and let it "run in the background" allowing you continue with the shell for other commands. is there an equivalent for bash?
[19:27] <blkadder> Yes.

[19:29] <blkadder> sako0938: What does that have to do with iptables?
[19:30] <Metalmurphy> Hi everyone. I'm having a weird problem. I just installed ubuntu 10.0 (old DVD I had), figured I'd just update to newest release instead of burning a new dvd. Anynway when I wasn't able to update I rebooted back to Windows 7, and now my network adapter only works at 10Mbps Full Duplex. It keeps disconnecting on any other setting. I have no idea why this is happening.
[19:30] <sako0938> Ive been reading that I should use iptables to forward the connection. I guess the issue is that lack of ath0, so any thoughts on that?

[19:32] <sako0938> how would i do that? I have internet so doesnt it already recognize the NIC

[19:32] <blkadder> Vi: That depends.
[19:32] <rye> meet: why isn't GUI working for you?
[19:33] <Vi> blkadder, how do you mean?
[19:33] <blkadder> Vi: Are you using iptables?
[19:33] <MichaelP> rye, i just wanted to patition a usb harddrive and treat that partition as if it was a ubuntu usb stick
[19:33] <rye> ClientAlive: i mean that while there appears to be an infrastructure for this, it is largerly unused and there are no plans (as far as I know) to mandate its support
[19:33] <Vi> blkadder, im learning, and i need to deliver proof to my teacher that there is portforwarding in the firewall (for use of a honeypot)

[19:35] <meet> rye:  it's not showing the delete or move to trash option in gui
[19:35] <rye> MichaelP: you can do this, yes, but you will need to manually write the image, create additional partitions but I've not done that
[19:36] <ClientAlive> rye: What you said there, that's what is confusing me by seeing that web page. It says: "Use the Session Options tabbed section..." which makes me think there is some interface to be found. wtf?
[19:36] <blkadder> Vi: What that is telling you is that iptables is not in use or not configured.
[19:36] <blkadder> Vi: So if it is acting as a firewall you need to determine what it is using for firewall software.
[19:37] <Vi> blkadder, yes indeed.
[19:37] <rye> ClientAlive: unfortunately the interface there is just an interface for applications that comply to the standard that gnome 2 uses. I am fairly sure there is even no session tab in gnome 3.
[19:37] <ClientAlive> rye: That web page is, apparently, in the "user-guide" (base on part of the url)

[19:38] <ZenMasta> is it possible to search for files based on a date range which they might have been modified?
[19:39] <hbyte> ls -lrt
[19:40] <rye> Metalmurphy: there may be an issue where linux driver puts a card in some state and windows driver does not reset it. Usually unplugging the machine and removing battery (if present) should clear the NIC's RAM
[19:40] <sako0938> Alright I looked at it says my wireless is connected under eth2.  Does there directions here:( http://www.howtoforge.com/internet-connection-sharing-masquerading-on-linux ) work? My install says iptables is not a service?
[19:40] <Metalmurphy> by battery, do u mean the rom one?
[19:40] <Vi> blkadder how do i go about this -_- sorry
[19:40] <Metalmurphy> or laptops one
[19:40] <rye> Metalmurphy: laptop's one
[19:41] <blkadder> Vi: ps -aef might be a good start.
[19:41] <Metalmurphy> desktop pc so dont have that. I'll try turning off the PSU.
[19:41] <Metalmurphy> thanks
[19:41] <ClientAlive> rye: why would they make it in a way that other apps need to comply? Afaik, if I type the path to the executable on the command line (often just the app's name) it will lanuch it. I'm also pretty sure a bash script would be capable of saving and restoring anythihng that is going on inside any application. I'm sure an interface for all that could be made to interact with all that too. Why wouldn't gnome just do what works? Makes no sense
[19:41] <ClientAlive> to me.
[19:41] <blkadder> Vi: Or perhaps asking the person responsible for the machine?

[19:48] <trijntje> Hi all, I need some advice on installing ubuntu on a new Acer laptop. 1) I cant seem to get in the bios using F2 or F12. 2) If I just place the usb stick in the laptop it keeps cycling through the first bootup sequence. Who can help me sort this out?
[19:48] <rye> rhin0: if it does not detect a drive when nothing else has changed _and_ BIOS does find the drive then this may be a bug. However, based on the available data some SSD drives _do_ die suddenly and can not be detected either by BIOS or OS, some can be recovered by firmware upgrade so you should check whether your drive can be detected by BIOS
[19:49] <rhin0> ok ty

[20:10] <trijntje> TexNixk: that is the end goal yes. And I've set the bios to boot from usb first
[20:10] <rye> trijntje: but there appears to be issues with various level of brokennes for the implementation - some laptops won't boot from usb device if it did not come up fast during POST, you may want to burn DVD since it appears to have better support by these broken UEFI boot things

[20:13] <koder> rye: do i have to have card with acceleration to play nexuiz ?
[20:14] <rye> koder: yes, since it is a 3D game. I think that with non-accelerated drivers it will be something like a turn-based strategy
[20:14] <koder> it's strange i remember playing it on old pc

[20:57] <jrib> Shutterstrom: best to just ask your question
[20:59] <mokujin> trijntje> still loads ubuntu
[20:59] <jhutchins> mokujin: THere may be something wrong with your windows install. Usually it takes over the system.
[21:00] <jhutchins> mokujin: You could try running update-grub to see if it auto-detects windows.  You should also make sure you have some sort of rescue CD to boot to if windows does take over the MBR.

[21:02] <Shutterstrom> I'm new to Linux and recently got a server where I have all my files (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS) and access them from my Windows 7 laptop. I mostly interact with the server from my laptop, but when I need to access the server from sftp (not from home) I need to change the ownership of the shared folder on order to access it from ftp program. I'm looking for a way to use both functions and not change
[21:02] <Shutterstrom> ownership of filestructure for each use.
[21:02] <guntbert> rasp_pie: better visit #ubuntu-de
[21:03] <jrib> Shutterstrom: what's the current ownership/permission like?  Why do you need to change it to access it?
[21:03] <trijntje> jhutchins: what do you mean?
[21:04] <rasp_pie> Hi. I installed the OS of my NAS on a cheap USB stick. it seems as this stick is losing data integrity or behaving strangely anyway. so I would like to buy a new USB stick to host the linux based operating system (=ubuntu). so what would you recommend me? does the manufacturer of the stick even matter? are there quality differences?

[21:04] <jhutchins> trijntje: Usually windows will overwrite the mbr without asking, so that it will boot directly on the next restart.  You then have to go back and replace the windows mbr with grub.
[21:05] <Shutterstrom> jrib: for sftp usage: sudo chown root:root -R /share/

[21:08] <rasp_pie> ok, that helps. thank you, everybody!
[21:09] <Shutterstrom> jrib: the sftp should only have acces to one folder in the /share structue so therefore I'm using an account (called: heju) that only have access to sftp and can not see anything else. My own account (henrik) has more access then my sftp account (heju)

[21:09] <jamescarr> like I rm -rf foo, /foo/bar/baz is a symlink to /usr/
[21:09] <jrib> Shutterstrom: so what are the normal permissions on /share, you never said
[21:10] <Shutterstrom> jrib: 755
[21:10] <jrib> Shutterstrom: and you need heju to have write permissions?
[21:11] <jrib> jamescarr: make a small example and see.  But no it should just unlink your symlink

[21:11] <Unicorn001> hi all, anyone who has experience with adding a linux boot entry to the Windows 8  Boot Manager while using UEFI bios boot option/disk setup?
[21:11] <jrib> Shutterstrom: by default you are giving "others" read permission with 755 so heju should be able to read
[21:12] <jrib> chaotix: ~/.icons used to work.  I haven't tried since gnome3 though.  I imagine it's still ok
[21:14] <Shutterstrom> jrib: Ok. let me rephrase that question in an other way then. Do you know how I can have full permissions on my samba share if it's owned by root and when I access it from my win7 laptop?
[21:15] <jrib> Shutterstrom: I'd ask you why not change the ownership to henrik
[21:16] <Shutterstrom> jrib: If I change ownership to henrik on /share I'm having problems to connect to the server from ftp.
[21:17] <jrib> Shutterstrom: what problems?

[21:28] <chessteach> I installed ubuntu via usb and it didn't complete the install. It didn't freeze or crash, but it got stuck on one step. It was disabling the cd from the source list and couldn't finish that step for whatever reason. I rebooted, and ubuntu loaded up fine.... Is there anyway to determine if I am missing something, or something is broken?
[21:28] <disharmonic> trijntje, Clonezilla does compression. Not sure if it doesa it on-the-fly though
[21:29] <trijntje> chessteach: I dont think there is. If you start getting all kinds of weird failures you might want to reinstall
[21:29] <_helios_> It's a USB wifi adapter its a pain in the butt to get working

[21:39] <jrib> Shutterstrom: oh, because of ChrootDirectory.  You require that?
[21:39] <uragano2> Hello, i suspect that somebody attacked my ubuntu-based home server and he successfully installed a rootkit. I scanned my system using rkhunter and chkrootkit in local and they didn't found nothing. But i had some supects yet
[21:40] <jrib> uragano2: what is your question?
[21:40] <Shutterstrom> jrib: is it because of the "ChrootDirectory" command? Is there anothere way to get to the correct folder on sftp access?

=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[21:42] <uragano2> so i decided to scan my hd from an other computer, surprise: the system results very infected. But now i suspect that the results are false positive, because a lot of files are infected. I did the test using option -r /media/InfectedDrive, how can i check if my system is really infected? :(
[21:43] <Shutterstrom> jrib: aha..? besides using the ChrootDirectory command?
[21:44] <jrib> Shutterstrom: right, if you don't need that, then you can get rid of it and you won't have to have the directory owned by root.  When you connect (how exactly do you connect?), you can tell your client to start in /share or whatever
[21:44] <uragano2> chkrootkit says that the system is sane, rkhunter says that the system is infected :S, who is right?
[21:44] <jrib> Shutterstrom: ChrootDirectory just restricts the user to that particular directory so he can't see outside of it
[21:44] <jrib> uragano2: well, investigate the rkhunter output more...

[21:48] <Shutterstrom> jrib: thanks for the info! the idea is (for security reasons) to limit sftp user to this area. I'm also planning to add my brother to access this area and then I don't want him to access anything else. therefore I think that the ChrootDirectory command might be good.
[21:48] <Shutterstrom> jrib: I'm accessing sftp from Firefox with FireFTP-plugin.
[21:49] <tozen> jhitchins: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1542681/
[21:49] <uragano2> jrib: anyway the depth log of rkhunter says only that the hash are different -.-
[21:49] <jrib> Shutterstrom: in that case, sshd_config documentation does say that root should own those files and no other user or group should be able to write to them.  I don't know if you can still use ACLs to add additional permissions to your other user.  You may want to ask #openssh about that

[22:00] <Lofde_> i started to remove teamviewer before you said that and it must have worked because i noticed my updates werent running and it instantly popped up after it removed it..

[22:02] <jrib> Shutterstrom: they don't have to be root no.  But if you want to use ChrootDirectory with them, they do.
[22:02] <jrib> Shutterstrom: in that case, sshd_config documentation does say that root should own those files and no other user or group should be able to write to them.

[22:06] <salzb> jpg images by their very nature have no physical size

[22:08] <usr13> salzb: jpg images do in fact have a physical size.
[22:08] <ephesius> john_rambo: you should be able to do it using imagemagick http://superuser.com/a/370982
[22:08] <salzb> usr13 explain
[22:09] <Lofde_> big efff you to update-manager ... big thank you to synaptic package manager...
[22:09] <salzb> how
[22:09] <usr13> salzb: I'd have to give an example.  Just a minute.
[22:09] <salzb> like do they have some physical size encoded in there
[22:09] <salzb> idk
[22:10] <salzb> perhaps i am wrong.

[22:14] <phunyguy> Hey everyone, I am trying to set up xbmc on Ubuntu 12.10, and I am a little confused with the audio portion.  I guess PulseAudio is decoding DTS and AC3 to PCM, but going over optical, I can only support two channels in that manner. (only way of connecting) - How can I tell it to pass-through AC3 and DTS streams over the optical output?
[22:14] <Unicorn001> (GruB)...
[22:15] <ephesius> john_rambo: its a command line application open terminal and run "identify image.jpg"
[22:15] <keithb> salzb: the photoelf site make the point you made, pictures have sizes in pixels, physical (inches or whatever) size depends on the dpi as you correctly stated
[22:16] <john_rambo> ephesius, I just did that but it is printing the pixels & not the value in inhes
[22:16] <ephesius> john_rambo: also just realized you said inches, this will only get you pixels afaik the actual measurement of the image would depend on the display its output to
[22:16] <usr13> salzb: http://jcubedtech.com/picbarimages/linux.jpg is 313x375 pixels which (if printed), would be 3.260x2.906 inches.
[22:17] <salzb> well, it depends on the dpi you print it at, i think
[22:17] <Ben64> definitely does
[22:17] <keithb> salzb: exactly
[22:18] <john_rambo> Okay
[22:18] <usr13> salzb: The physical size of http://jcubedtech.com/picbarimages/linux.jpg  is approximately 3&1/4" by 3".
[22:18] <usr13> salzb: No that is the size of the image.
[22:18] <Ben64> usr13: not necessarily
[22:19] <ephesius> john_rambo: this will give you a size in inches no idea what dpi its at though "identify -verbose image.jpg
[22:20] <ephesius> john_rambo: "identify -verbose image.jpg | grep Print"
[22:20] <usr13> salzb: The the higher the DPI the better the image quality, but the size will remain the same.  If you print it at it's actual size it will be 3.260"x3.9"  (My first statement was wrong, this is correct.)   about 3&1/4" by 4"  That is correct.
[22:20] <usr13> Ben64: Download the image yourself and see.
[22:21] <Ben64> yeah thats for 96dpi, which is not very good
[22:21] <usr13> it is 313 x 375 pixels which is 3.260" x 3.906"
[22:21] <john_rambo> ephesius, Found it. Thanks
[22:21] <keithb> usr13: no, the physical size depends on the dpi used. Higher dpi (for a fixed number of pixels) gives a smaller (phyical) image
[22:22] <ddssc> hai, what's the best way to install python on debian 6.0 squeeze? it's default is 2.6 I need 2.7
[22:22] <usr13> keithb: DPI is Dots Per Inch.
[22:22] <salzb> a jpg is a grid of various pixels with different colour values, of some fixed dimensions
[22:22] <zoktar> having issues supplying bug reports via ubuntu-bug 12.10 unity, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1542820/
[22:22] <keithb> usr13: exactly so 1 dot = 1 pixel and a hiher dpi means a smaller picture
[22:23] <jrib> ddssc: #debian for debian support
[22:23] <ddssc> jrib, my bad
[22:24] <usr13> keithb: Higher DPI means higher quality.
[22:24] <ephesius> usr13: assuming an infinite amount of pixels
[22:24] <keithb> usr13: you are forgetting that the number of pixels is fixed
=== Chex is now known as Guest88239

[22:25] <salzb> ok, suppose you were trying to print a large jpg image on a small physical area at a low dpi
[22:25] <salzb> you could perhaps do that by scaling it down and losing quality in that way

[22:26] <CrashUbi> I'm using an ubuntu live cd to investigate how a virus got onto my mother's windows 7 computer.  I found some of the virus' files were created at 21:31 yesterday.  How can I find other files that were created and access shortly before that to see what the user was doing leading up to that?
[22:26] <usr13> keithb: ephesius salzb For an explaination of the relationship of  DPI  as it relates to printers and images, see:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch
[22:27] <Ben64> CrashUbi: i'll save you some trouble. she was on the internet and saw a thing to "clean her computer" so she downloaded it and ran it
[22:27] <salzb> i understand dpi, but usr13 do you agree or disagree that a jpg is a grid of pixels of fixed dimensions, with various colour values?
[22:27] <usr13> "In printing, DPI (dots per inch) refers to the output resolution of a printer or imagesetter, and PPI (pixels per inch) refers to the input resolution of a photograph or image. DPI refers to the physical dot density of an image"
[22:27] <keithb> usr13: I don't care what wikipedia says, if you have NxN pixels in an image the square picture will have a side of N*dpi
[22:27] <salzb> i don't see how such a file can have physical dimensions
[22:28] <Ben64> usr13: we know all that, we're just saying you can't make a blanket statement that everything is 96dpi
[22:28] <salzb> independent of the dpi of whatever way you want to print or display it
[22:28] <keithb> I agree with salzb
[22:29] <ephesius> i agree with keithb agreeing with salzb
[22:29] <salzb> if you stipulate it's 96dpi or whatever it's easy to calculate the dimensions, of course
[22:29] <usr13> You guys can believe what you want to believe but it is what it is.
[22:29] <CrashUbi> ben64: If my mother were using the computer at the time, I'd agree, but it was my niece playing games.  I'm trying to find out what executable she downloaded, so I can block the download site after I restore it.

[22:30] <Lofde_> why cant DD have a progress meter like Wget :(
[22:30] <Ben64> CrashUbi: you can use "find" to find files created on the same day, but not time... you can use a weird "ls" thing to do it though

[22:31] <Lofde_> i dont want to kill it i want to watch the operation of the img transfer ..
[22:31] <Ben64> Lofde_: sigusr1 doesn't kill it, it prints stats
[22:31] <ephesius> usr13: at 96 DPI you are correct but at 600 DPI it is 0.52x0.63 inches

[22:32] <Lofde_> ah ok... it would be cool if there was one that instead of seeing the processing stats could actually tell read rates .. ?
[22:32] <GuidoPallemans> jrib ah just double-click it in nautilus, and then it would open a terminal which runs openx selectedfile.x

[23:29] <irv> i'm running a cs go server and it can't write the automatic demos to the folder so just chown the whole folder?
[23:29] <irv> or is there a way to just make it writable
[23:29] <madprops> is the hicolor icon set still supported? i run batti a battery monitor for the tray but some of icons are missing
[23:29] <usr13> helder: I dono... should have done it. Did you do nvidia-settings?
[23:30] <Bower^> irv: chmod will do that
[23:30] <irv> just with the dirname? thanks!
[23:31] <usr13> irv: Look at and see what needs to be done.   ls -l
[23:31] <Bower^> you should read up permissions (link ubottu provided)
[23:31] <irv> thanks all :D
[23:31] <madprops> what's the command to fire up the indicator area?
[23:31] <helder> usr13: yes i run nvidia-settings as well, but like i said, there were not the usual information or options...
[23:32] <usr13> helder: How did you install the driver?
[23:33] <Bower^> any recommendations for a database querying program? bit tired of using phpmyadmin
[23:38] <ox1de> I have one suggestion to the Ubuntu programmers: Please upgrade and program better music visualizers for ubuntu!
[23:38] <ox1de> music visualizers are the only thing I've ever found lacking in ubuntu
[23:39] <usr13> ox1de: We mostly just listen to music....  (sorry, couldn't resist :)
[23:41] <usr13> I wish I would have asked what his favorite music visualizer was.  Darn it....
[23:43] <helder> usr13: via the software sources dialog box
[23:45] <ubu> help, i have xubuntu 12.10 x64...all good, but now /tmp size is only 1MB...what happened?  i can't update my system because /tmp is only 1MB
[23:47] <madprops> anybody knows of a nano based editor but better?
[23:47] <madprops> like not vi or emacs
[23:47] <madprops> just a simple editor
[23:47] <jrib> madprops: what's wrong with nano?
[23:47] <madprops> just wondering if there was something more powerful
=== JoseAntonioR is now known as JoseeAntonioR
[23:47] <madprops> that i was missing
[23:47] <jrib> madprops: vim and emacs :)
[23:47] <madprops> >_>
[23:48] <jrib> madprops: there are a few other editors but those are the big three.  Just search the repositories for "text editor"
[23:51] <irv> sorry to bug y'all again, but after reading the article i'm still a bit confused how i would do one thing.. i want to temporarily add a user to have write permissions to the root of the filesystem (/) but not underneath that. is this possible?
[23:51] <jrib> irv: why do you want to do that?
[23:51] <irv> there's a bug in a piece of software which is writing files there. i need to be able to run it tonight before a patch will be out heh
[23:52] <irv> and i'm running the program that's writing there as my user
[23:52] <irv> rather than root
[23:52] <irv> heh
[23:52] <irv> so instead of running it as root i'd prefer to temporarily put the write permissions for my user account to /
[23:52] <irv> i suppose it doesn't matter if it's the whole filesystem underneath, except for the fact that it would be harder to undo i think
[23:53] <jrib> irv: i would not advise giving a piece of buggy software permissions to /...
[23:53] <BvL> is there any way to figure out what the original file names are in the "lost+found folder?"
[23:53] <irv> it's a halflife server
[23:53] <irv> they have a bug that stores the demos automatically but it's adding a / infront of the filename, causing it to try to store in the root of hte filesystem
[23:54] <irv> if running the entire server as root is a more secure solution, then i guess i'll do that
[23:54] <jrib> irv: you can't turn off the demos saving automatically?
[23:54] <irv> it just seems less secure to run the whole thing as root rather than just giving it write access to one dir
[23:54] <jrib> irv: it's not secure, it's just about as bad
=== guenther_richard is now known as gnuman
[23:54] <irv> i could turn off the auto recording, but then i have to manually start and stop the recordings throughout the night
[23:55] <irv> which is not what i'd like to be doing this evening :P
[23:55] <jrib> irv: is this some new bug?
[23:55] <irv> however if there's no way then i dunno
[23:55] <irv> it's CSGO specifically
[23:55] <irv> and it's been reported for a few months, just hasn't been patched yet
[23:55] <irv> http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=3031882
[23:55] <KI4RO> Anyone know where the latest version (2.1.3) of gtkpod is?
[23:55] <irv> this character realized that it was trying to write to the root dir
[23:55] <irv> which is why it was failing even when i gave myself write permissions to the dir where the binary is :P
[23:56] <irv> so there's no way to give it just write access to / and not every folder underneath?

[23:57] <ox1de> OK! I found a music visual called soundwheel but it wants me to "buy" althought the price is set to $0.00
[23:57] <ox1de> I'd like to try it, what should I do?
[23:58] <ox1de> I have no way of paying for software
[23:58] <BvL> is there any way to figure out what the original file names are in the "lost+found folder?"
