[16:16] <Espreon> Hello, people.
[16:26] <brobostigon> good afternoon Espreon
[16:27] <Espreon> Why thank you.
[16:27] <Espreon> How have you been, brobostigon?
[16:27] <brobostigon> good bits and bad. and you?
[16:27] <Espreon> Fairly well I've been
[16:27] <Espreon> Three As and a C- this semester.
[16:28] <Espreon> ... well... the one I just finished.
[16:28] <brobostigon> thats pretty good.
[16:28] <Espreon> Heh heh.
[16:28] <Espreon> Some may argue it's not 'cause of the C-.
[16:28] <brobostigon> a c still aint bad, it could be worse.
[16:29] <Espreon> Well, I think C-s are not transferrable.
[16:29] <Espreon> Not that I plan on transferring.
[16:29] <brobostigon> ok.
[16:30] <Espreon> It was in a "schupid" class anyway.
[16:30] <Espreon> So... I'm happy I passed.
[16:30] <brobostigon> :)
[16:32] <Espreon> I also made some wassail.
[16:33] <Espreon> ... a couple of days ago.
[16:33] <brobostigon> what is it ?
[16:34] <Espreon> An English drink. It's basically warm, spiced apple cider.
[16:35] <Espreon> Though I added blackberries this time.
[16:35] <brobostigon> ah.
[16:35] <brobostigon> never heard of it, and i am english
[16:36] <Espreon> Really? You never heard of it? Hmm.
[16:38] <brobostigon> nope. never,
[16:38] <Espreon> Guess traditions are a-dying.
[16:38] <brobostigon> where in england is it from?
[16:38] <Espreon> I have no idea.
[16:39] <Espreon> I believe it's of Germanic origin.
[16:39] <brobostigon> because i am from lincolnshire.
[16:39] <brobostigon> and they dont really produce apples up there.
[16:39] <Espreon> Southern England, according to Wikipedia.
[16:40] <brobostigon> there you go,
[16:40] <Espreon> You should make some; it's good.
[16:41] <brobostigon> i wouldnt, cider makes me very ill.
[16:41] <Espreon> Awwww... :(
[16:42] <brobostigon> tried it once, and wont ever again.
[16:42] <brobostigon> i was ill for hours after.
[16:46] <Espreon> That bad, eh? That's unfortunate.
[16:47] <Espreon> I drink cider a lot.
[16:47] <Espreon> ... so I think (or... thought) only good things about it.
[16:47] <brobostigon> yes, that bad.
[16:47] <brobostigon> ah, ohwell.
[16:54] <Espreon> Bad cider, stop being mean to brobostigon.
[16:54] <Espreon> And sadly, I'm not a magick faerie.
[16:54] <brobostigon> Espreon: i was with my dad, who likes cider, and he said it was good cider.
[16:54] <Espreon> If I were, I'd change that C- into an A.
[16:55] <Espreon> Huh.
[16:55] <Espreon> Oh well. :(
[16:55] <brobostigon> yep :(
[16:58] <Espreon> Do you like blackberries, brobostigon?
[16:58] <Espreon> Or do they not like you?
[16:58] <brobostigon> sometimes, yes.
[16:58] <Espreon> Only sometimes?
[16:58] <brobostigon> liking them.
[16:59] <Espreon> I always like them and they always like me.
[16:59] <Espreon> ... ... I kinda binge eat them.
[16:59] <brobostigon> ok
[16:59] <Espreon> ... yeah.
[16:59] <brobostigon> lol
[17:00] <Espreon> Berries... I love them..
[17:01] <brobostigon> :)
[17:01] <Espreon> I wish I had some tiramisù right now.
[17:01] <Espreon> Do you like tiramisù, brobostigon?
[17:02] <brobostigon> i cant, i am allergic to dairy.
[17:02] <Espreon> Oh, that's right.
[17:02] <Espreon> brobostigon: What is your opinion of those who use the deep, broad a in words like "bath"?
[17:02] <brobostigon> i wouldnt mind the alcohol in it though, :)
[17:02] <Espreon> Heh heh.
[17:03] <brobostigon> Espreon: i have no opinion, it is just different pronounciation.
[17:03] <Espreon> All right.
[17:03] <Espreon> Do you speak of tahcos or tackos?
[17:04] <brobostigon> as in takos ?
[17:04] <Espreon> No, as in the Mexican dish.
[17:04] <brobostigon> the latter.
[17:05] <Espreon> Do "foot" and "strut" rhyme for you?
[17:06] <brobostigon> abit.
[17:06] <Espreon> Is there a "real" g at the end of "sing" for you?
[17:07] <brobostigon> yes.
[17:07] <Espreon> And you do not say your "r"s like zee Frensh, yes?
[17:08] <brobostigon> not really sure, never thought about it.
[17:08] <Espreon> I know I don't.
[17:08] <Espreon> I either curl my tongue back or say them like a Scotsman.
[17:08] <Espreon> ... when I feel like it.
[17:08] <brobostigon> ok.
[17:09] <Espreon> OK, now you may ask me a million questions about how I say things too.
[17:09] <brobostigon> i dont have any, to be honest,
[17:09] <Espreon> How come?
[17:09] <brobostigon> i cant think of any.
[17:10] <Espreon> I'll throw some things out there: taco is "tahco" ... wasp is "wahsp" ... ... ... and bath is not "bahth".
[17:11] <ianto> bath is short for me, tacos as in a short a again. foor and strut don't rhyme and I can't tell if there's a g on the end of sing or not
[17:11] <brobostigon> afternoonings ianto
[17:11] <Espreon> Hello, ianto.
[17:11] <ianto> wasp is the same vowel as "hot" to me too ;)
[17:12] <ianto> shwmae pawb
[17:12] <Espreon> This one's hot is "haht".
[17:13] <Espreon> A dog is a "dahg"... ... what else...?
[17:13] <Espreon> But an orange is not an "ahrange".
[17:13] <ianto> OK hot as in the same sound as the o in orange
[17:14] <Espreon> Though the o in mine is probably not yours.
[17:14] <Espreon> We don't have that sound.
[17:14] <Espreon> ... the people in Boston do, though.
[17:15] <Espreon> Keep in mind that a writer is not rider to this one.
[17:15] <Espreon> It may be to some people in this country, but I don't know any of these people.
[17:15] <Espreon> They're probably in that weird place called California.
[17:17] <Espreon> And I guess the two of you have no idea why the two would sound the same. Am I right?
[17:19] <ianto> Espreon: http://users.aber.ac.uk/crs14/wasp.wma
[17:19] <ianto> That's my way of saying it ;)
[17:20] <Espreon> So I hear.
[17:25] <Espreon> ianto: Hey, did you ever get back to translating Wesnoth or did you run into annoying problems and decide to stop?
[17:53] <ianto> Espreon: Sorry I've been quite preoccupied
[17:53] <Espreon> Ah, it's OK.
