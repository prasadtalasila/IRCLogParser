=== zmoylan1 is now known as zmoylan
[11:33] <czajkowski> hows folks
[12:09] <terran> grand sure
[14:41] <czajkowski> zmoylan: hows the hip doing ?
[14:42] <zmoylan> down to one crutch.  have been out using a stick instead of crutch but it's pushing it a little too hard.  try and walk for at least an hour a day to keep pushing it.  how's the back?
[14:44] <czajkowski> a lot straigher
[14:44] <czajkowski> only an inch and a half out now from being totally straight
[14:44] <czajkowski> have a great physio
[14:44] <czajkowski> works wonders!
[14:44] <zmoylan> can make all the difference!
[14:46] <zmoylan> it's one of those professions like nursing which is much under appreciated.
[14:46] <czajkowski> it really can
[14:46] <czajkowski> I usually swear while his elbow is in my spine
[14:46] <czajkowski> and he uses needles at the same time also
[14:46] <zmoylan> it's so hard to quantify the difference between good and great.
[14:46] <czajkowski> but so effective
[14:49] <zmoylan> no further surgical intervention required?
[15:02] <czajkowski> well will depend on how I get on with this physio tbh
[15:03] <zmoylan> fingers crossed all goes well!

[15:59] <solarcloud_3srcn> It would be nice to get him to sign something, as he may not be around in a decade or so ...
[16:00] <czajkowski> not if he keeps eating stuff off his feet or beard
[16:00] <solarcloud_3srcn> hahaha !
