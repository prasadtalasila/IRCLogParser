[09:55] <soee> good miorning
[11:08] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[16:25] <shadeslayer> loads of fun installing Ubuntu on a Win8 machine today
[16:28] <ronnoc_> shadeslayer: any UEFI issues?
=== ronnoc_ is now known as ronnoc
[16:30] <shadeslayer> yep
[16:31] <shadeslayer> secure boot was to blame 99% of them
[16:31] <shadeslayer> because as it turns out even if you load signed grub , you can't run commands from the grub prompt
[16:31] <shadeslayer> so things like ls won't work
[16:32] <shadeslayer> as well as drivemap
[16:32] <shadeslayer> becuase SB treats them as insecure binaries I guess
[16:32] <shadeslayer> then the chainloader command won't work because it can't find the windows 8 efi bootloader
[16:33] <shadeslayer> debugging from grub was made extremely hard due to Secure Boot
[16:33] <shadeslayer> so I had to disable it
[16:33] <shadeslayer> BUT
[16:33] <shadeslayer> if you just use K/Ubuntu, you can use Secure Boot
[16:33] <shadeslayer> a huge win if you ask me
[16:34] <shadeslayer> oh and the BIOS is funky, you have disable fast bios loading to change boot order
[22:42] <BarkingFish> evening guys :)  Long time no see.  Can someone please tell me what the security update to VLC is please?  I'm not getting any change data in apper, and I'm streaming using VLC right now.
[22:47] <TheLordOfTime> wouldn't it be in the changelogs?
[22:47] <TheLordOfTime> (sorry, but... it's a valid point)
[22:50] <BarkingFish> It would be, I'm sure - if I could remember how to get at them.  I have a memory like a colander and all the recall skills of a goldfish.
[22:53] <BarkingFish> nvm, found it - apparently it's something to do with a buffer overflow, which can allow arbitrary code to be executed, so I'm guessing it's probably something I shouldn't be ignoring right now :)
[22:53]  * BarkingFish closes his vlc stream and updates :)
[22:55] <TheLordOfTime> BarkingFish, :P
[23:07] <allee> afiestas: FYI the last libkscreen commit breaks compilation on quantal: http://paste.kde.org/645422/
