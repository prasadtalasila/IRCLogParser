[05:33] <barrydk> Good morning everyone
[06:31] <mazal> Morning everyone
[07:08] <Kilos> afternoon all
[07:23] <Kilos> hi mazal wen julle
[07:23] <Kilos> ?
[07:28] <Kilos> inetpro_, you got a tail
[07:28] <Kilos> good morning
[07:31] <mazal> More oom Kilos
[07:32] <mazal> Yep it's running , just the ssh that refuses to work. So I will go and work on the server itself when needed
[07:32] <mazal> Didn't want to hold back to job for that stupid problem
[07:32] <Kilos> ah
[07:33] <mazal> And now no more pathetic 800kb/s copy speed to the server like it was
[07:33] <mazal> Now it's normal at 10mb/s
[07:33] <Kilos> lekker
[07:34] <mazal> I told everyone it's software and none believed me
[07:34] <mazal> Soon as I changed the software now the speed is right
[07:34] <Kilos> they ping each other ok?
[07:34] <mazal> Ya everything is sharp now. Well except the stupid putty thing
[07:35] <Kilos> so ssh from both sides doesnt work?
[07:35] <mazal> Only from my pc
[07:35] <mazal> And only to the new server
[07:35] <mazal> My pc works to the other two servers
[07:35] <Kilos> but from the new server to your pc?
[07:35] <mazal> And ubuntu boxes works to the new server
[07:36] <mazal> Is just from my pc
[07:36] <mazal> Can't ssh to my pc , Windows doesn't have ssh server
[07:36] <Kilos> if you install putty there
[07:36] <Kilos> on the windows pc
[07:38] <Kilos> http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/faq.html
[07:39] <Kilos> im sure its just a tiny thing needs configuring
[07:39] <Kilos> but to find it is the thing
[07:45] <mazal> Putty is already installed on the win pc
[07:45] <mazal> That is the ssh client
[07:58] <Kilos> hmmm
[07:59] <Kilos> frustrating
[08:13] <Kilos> ja barrydk 
[08:13] <barrydk> Hello kilos

[08:21] <roryy> hey Kilos
[08:21] <Kilos> hurt it 2 weeks back tipping over the bi ram to innoculate him
[08:21] <Kilos> big
[08:22] <Kilos> strong swine. 80 to 90 kgs
[08:22] <barrydk> I got a high speed lead injection system for you to borrow
[08:22] <barrydk> Hmm sounds like a lot of meat
[08:23] <Kilos> yeah
[08:23] <Kilos> chops on the hoof
[08:23] <barrydk> nou i feel for a braai stopit

[08:27] <Kilos> hehe
[08:28] <Kilos> ive seen here how patient he is . we had one really piggy windows guy that tried ubuntu and just complained and threatened to go back to windows all the time
[08:28] <Kilos> he was handle very calmly and in a gentlemanly way
[08:28] <Kilos> diplomatic
[08:28] <Kilos> Maaz, diplomat
[08:28] <Maaz> A diplomat is a person who can tell others to go to hell in such a nice way that they look forward to the trip
=== inetpro_ is now known as inetpro
[08:29] <inetpro> goeie more
[08:29] <inetpro> dankie Kilos
[08:30] <barrydk> More inetpro 
[08:30] <Kilos> vir inetpro ?
[08:32] <inetpro> Kilos: so iets ja
[08:34] <Kilos> o die stert
[08:35] <Kilos> sjoe
[08:37] <roryy> if i want to live boot ubuntu 12.10 on a Windows 8 machine (i.e., SecureBoot), will only the 64-bit version work?
[08:38] <Kilos> nope
[08:38] <Kilos> 32 should work too
[08:39] <roryy> ok - my googling so far suggests the opposite.  i don't suppose you've tried it?
[08:40] <Kilos> nope dont have 8 but it worked on 7
[08:40] <Kilos> i removed 7 and installed 12.04 kde
[08:40] <roryy> I thought SecureBoot was more-or-less a Windows 8 only thing
[08:40] <roryy> 12.04 doesn't (yet) support SecureBoot, AFAIK
[08:41] <Kilos> ?
[08:41] <Kilos> i think the fly got 8 then dumped it again he will know methinks
[08:41] <roryy> well, see here for example: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[08:42] <roryy> also been articles on lwn.net about how different distros will handle secureboot
[08:42] <Kilos> i dunno if theres anything in bios that makes it want to see 64b
[08:42] <Kilos> i go see
[08:43] <Kilos> hi Wraz 
[08:43] <Wraz> Aloha
[08:43] <Kilos> oh thats the new bios thing
[08:44] <Kilos> is it a new pc
[08:44] <roryy> yeah
[08:44] <roryy> i haven't bought it yet :-)
[08:44] <roryy> want to try booting ubuntu before buying
[08:44] <Kilos> ah
[08:44] <roryy> and it'll take me another 2.5 hours to download the 64-bit image
[08:44] <Kilos> ask in the mailing list if anyone has tried
[08:44] <roryy> ag, might as well
[08:47] <roryy> thanks Kilos
[08:47] <Kilos> if time is the only snag then do it and you got both
[08:47] <Kilos> np sorry i couldnt be more specific
[08:47] <roryy> yeah, i need the 64-bit anyway - machine has 6GB mem
[08:47] <Kilos> nice
[08:50] <inetpro> roryy: please come back and tell us here if you found a solution
[08:51] <roryy> inetpro: i'm downloading the 64-bit image, will go to the shop and boot with that.  Will let you guys know if it works or not
[08:51] <Kilos> ty roryy 
[08:52] <inetpro> roryy: thanks
[08:55] <inetpro> roryy: let's hope the guys at the shop will allow you to boot with that
[08:55] <Kilos> yeah
[08:56] <roryy> *shrug* I won't buy the laptop otherwise
[08:56] <Kilos> hehe
[08:56] <roryy> srsly - i can't spend that much without knowing if it will work for me
[08:57] <Kilos> of course
[08:57] <Kilos> no choice of getting one without windows installed
[08:57] <Kilos> ?
[08:57] <roryy> not this model, i don't think
[08:58] <Kilos> lol have you googled that?
[08:58] <Kilos> what lappy is it
[08:58] <inetpro> well it seems you may need to tweak a setting or more in the bios before it will work
[08:58] <roryy> http://www.hpshop.co.za/p-8550-hp-envy-m6-1110ei-notebook-c2b86ea.aspx
[08:59] <roryy> my perception was 12.10 *should* work with these machines out-the-box
[08:59] <roryy> barring bugs, of which i gather there are a few
[09:00] <Kilos> maybe 8 has added something
[09:00] <Kilos> 7 was very security conscious so 8 must be worse
[09:02] <Kilos> or even ask the shop for one without windows preinstalled
[09:03] <Kilos> looks like a cool machine
[09:03] <roryy> Kilos: it's about boot-up: Windows 8 ready machines will only boot images that have been digitally signed by Microsoft.  Ubuntu, Fedora and I think SuSE all have different solutions for this.  E.g. http://blog.canonical.com/2012/06/22/an-update-on-ubuntu-and-secure-boot/
[09:04] <Kilos> aw the fly gone
[09:04] <Kilos> wb superfly_ 
[09:04] <Kilos> and mrs_fly 
[09:04] <Kilos> hehe inetpro the bot greeted him
[09:05] <inetpro> Kilos: very interesting
[09:05] <Kilos> yeah
[09:05] <inetpro> but Kilos, that's because he has a tail
[09:05] <Kilos> oh my
[09:05] <inetpro> your bot has never seen him with a tail
[09:06] <Kilos> i hoped she was eveolving into a cleverer bot
[09:06] <Kilos> oh well she greeted anyway
[09:06] <Kilos> evolving
[09:06] <inetpro> Kilos: she will remember now
[09:06] <Kilos> hope so
[09:06] <inetpro> until tonight at least
[09:07] <inetpro> or when you kill it again
[09:07] <Kilos> oh ya
[09:07] <inetpro> a bot really needs to stay online for it to be useful
[09:09] <Kilos> i spose
[09:09] <Kilos> but then i dont see whats happening
[09:09] <Kilos> scared to come back and pc is hung again
[09:09] <Kilos> oh i must show you
[09:12] <inetpro> Kilos: show me?
[09:12] <Kilos> ya weird things here since that crash
[09:13] <Kilos> sec i gotta find a place to upload a pic
[09:19] <Kilos> this is what i see while booting up to where password required
[09:19] <Kilos> http://imageshack.us/content_round.php?page=done&l=img194/2988/image0046h.jpg
[09:20] <Kilos> dunno if thats because of pci graphics card
[09:22] <Kilos> inetpro, ^^
[09:22] <Kilos> i wish there was an image site as easy as slexy.org
[09:35] <inetpro> Kilos: so what do you do to get past that?
[09:36] <Kilos> i wait till i see the purple screen with password block
[09:36] <Kilos> hehe
[09:36] <inetpro> hmm... 
[09:36] <Kilos> it still boots fine just doesnt show the purple screen
[09:37] <Kilos> till password block comes up that is
[09:37] <inetpro> just disable the splash screen 
[09:37] <inetpro> and stop worrying about it
[09:37] <Kilos> lol
[09:38] <Kilos> is that white striped screen the splash screen
[09:38] <inetpro> supposedly
[09:38] <Kilos> its close to what i see on server boot
[09:39] <inetpro> google is your friend
[09:39] <Kilos> but server goes to cli only
[09:39] <Kilos> nee man its not a prob
[09:39] <Kilos> wanna get the latest 12.04 iso when data fullup again
[09:40] <Kilos> i got 1g for the month still and 350 night surfer so maybe will get 12.04.4 iso that way
[09:41] <Kilos> the have 500 or so for the month
[09:42] <superfly_> gah, stupid Freenode again, it seems.
=== superfly_ is now known as superfly
[09:43] <Kilos> hi superfly 
[09:44] <Kilos> did you see my bot greeted you with the tail
[09:50] <superfly> yes
[10:13] <Squirm> hello
[10:15] <Kilos> synaptic is a useful tool. its shows grub-common grub-pc-bin grub2 and grub2-common as needing upgrades
[10:15] <Kilos> hi Squirm 
[10:15] <Kilos> maybe thats the splash prob
[10:16] <Kilos> the "mark all upgrades" function is cool too. shows 22.9m to be downloaded
[10:16] <Kilos> if i disappear something didnt work
[10:17] <Kilos> lotsa compiz stuff
[10:18] <Kilos> and nautilus
[10:21] <mazal> Right , server nr 2 for redo here I come
[10:21] <Kilos> hope you got better luck with the ssh thing
[10:22] <Kilos> you can still ssh it now
[10:22] <Kilos> if you cant after the redo you doing something wrong
[10:26] <mazal> This one is a very quick and easy single public share server
[10:27] <mazal> Everything SHOULD go well
[10:27] <mazal> But with computers you never know
[10:27] <superfly> mazal: just a quick question: why are you redoing the servers?
[10:27] <mazal> It's that old 10.10 remember ?
[10:28] <superfly> and you don't want to do staggered upgrades?
[10:28] <mazal> The main one I redid cause of the dreadfull samba problem in it that only worked at 800kb/s over the network
[10:28] <mazal> This one is because of that stupid "keep showing old file sizes and dates on files" problem
[10:28] <mazal> So Hope the newer software will help
[10:29] <mazal> Doing both with 12.04.01
[10:31] <mazal> Oh and both are now 64bit , previously 32bit. That's the other change
[10:34] <superfly> ah, right. yes, you can't change architecture without a complete reinstall
[10:46] <mazal> 2nd server done
[10:46] <mazal> Wish they all were that easy
[10:46] <Kilos> well done
[10:47] <mazal> Ja this is just the little avupdate distributer
[10:47] <mazal> 1 share that is public and that's it
[10:49] <superfly> magespawn: ever heard of Umziki Pan?
[10:49] <mazal> Kilo's guess what , that one's ssh also not working
[10:49] <Kilos> uh oh
[10:50] <mazal> Is defnitely something on the new ssh software blocking my pc. Now I'm convinced of it
[10:51] <Kilos> does it matter if your pc is 32bit and server 64bit
[10:51] <mazal> nope
[10:52] <Kilos> well sort the ssh thing before you do the next server
[10:53] <mazal> No I am done for now , is nou moeg vir servers
[10:54] <Kilos> hehe
[10:54] <Kilos> wat se google van dit
[10:54] <mazal> I anyway don't even know where to look. Same software works on server 3
[10:54] <mazal> Only difference , that one is 32bit
[10:54] <mazal> Google gives the usual , thousands of post with no real solution
[10:55] <Kilos> ai
[10:55] <mazal> Google does not know everything
[10:56] <Kilos> install 64bit ubuntu on one pc and try ssh from there
[10:56] <mazal> ssh works from ubuntu boxes
[10:56] <Kilos> all you have changed is 32 to 64bit
[10:56] <mazal> Already saw that
[10:57] <mazal> Nope , much newer software as well
[10:57] <Kilos> kop krap dan
[10:57] <Kilos> baie
[10:57] <mazal> One was 10.10 and the other 11.10
[10:57] <Kilos> ya but 32bit
[10:57] <mazal> yeah
[10:58] <Kilos> are you sure a 32bit pc can ssh a 64bit server?
[10:59] <mazal> Yep
[10:59] <mazal> That's not relevant
[10:59] <Kilos> oh
[11:01] <Kilos> now you gotta do everything manually from the servers till ssh sorted hey?
[11:02] <mazal> Gaan eers sweets soek
[11:02] <mazal> l8tr
[11:02] <Kilos> hehe
[11:49] <Vince-0> suuup
[11:49] <Vince-0> Friday's up
[11:50] <Kilos> lo Vince-0 
[11:52] <Kilos> wbb
[11:57] <Kilos> hey bakuman Banlam 
[11:57] <bakuman> hi hi
[12:02] <Vince-0> mazal was having issues with ssh serve access? I often find ssh-server not installed by default 
[12:03] <mazal> It's there , I added it myself and can ssh from Linux box to it
[12:03] <mazal> And , hi Vince-0 :)
[12:03] <mazal> Don't think I saw you yet today
[12:10] <magespawn> Howdy all
[12:12] <superfly> yo magespawn
[12:12] <mazal> Hi magespawn 
[12:15] <superfly> magespawn: heard of umzini pan?
[12:17] <magespawn> Hey superfly not sure,muzi pan yes, there by mkuzi?
[12:17] <magespawn> Hey mazal
[12:17] <superfly> magespawn: yes, I think so
[12:17] <superfly> I think they're on the other side of the game reserve to Hluhluwe
[12:19] <magespawn> Will look it to see if we are talking about the same place
[12:20] <superfly> magespawn: http://www.umzikipan.co.za/
[12:21] <superfly> http://goo.gl/maps/ABMsb
[12:22] <superfly> a little bit off the beaten track from Hluhluwe, but it doesn't look like too far
[12:23] <superfly> Ah, it looks like there's a fairly direct route
[12:23] <superfly> 15 minutes drive
[12:25] <magespawn> Do not know much about it, but it is only abou 15-20, and the dirt section of the road is in relatively good condition
[12:30] <magespawn> when coming to hluhluwe there is no shortage of accommodation options
[12:31] <magespawn> superfly you would have to go though hluhluwe to get there
[12:32] <superfly> magespawn: that's fine
[12:32] <superfly> magespawn: so you'd better be around on Monday the 3rd of June - we're coming to visit!
[12:33] <magespawn> may just have to take an extended leave then
[12:34] <magespawn> on that map my shop is above the last e in the left hand hluhluwe
[12:35] <magespawn> and i stay just about where the pink edge of town is marked
[12:37]  * magespawn hastily checks his calender and tries to contrive some reason to skip town
[12:39] <mazal> Bye guys , have a good evening
[12:40] <charl_> good afternoon
[12:40] <Kilos> hehe @ magespawn 
[12:40] <charl_> Maaz: coffee on
[12:40]  * Maaz flips the salt-timer
[12:40] <Kilos> hi charl_ 
[12:40] <magespawn> hi charl_
[12:40] <charl_> hi Kilos 
[12:40] <charl_> hi magespawn 
[12:40] <magespawn> superfly the whole family coming?
[12:41] <Kilos> well duh
[12:41] <Kilos> who goes on leave without his family
[12:42] <magespawn> some people do, and with little babies, but each to his own
[12:42] <charl_> that's pretty bad
[12:43] <magespawn> i also paranoid people who would not bring a little kid to this part of the world
[12:43] <magespawn> ^know
[12:43] <superfly> magespawn: yup, all of us
[12:43] <superfly> making a road trip
[12:44] <Maaz> Coffee's ready for charl_!
[12:45] <charl_> Maaz: danke schon
[12:45] <Maaz> charl_: What?
[12:45] <charl_> Maaz: dankeschon
[12:45] <Maaz> charl_: Sorry...
[12:45] <charl_> Maaz: danke
[12:45] <Maaz> Bitteschön
[12:45] <charl_> Maaz: you need an upgrade :)
[12:45] <Maaz> charl_: What?
[12:45] <magespawn> cool superfly, will have real coffee/tea ready
[12:46] <superfly> magespawn: w00t! :-)
[12:46] <magespawn> we just arrived in Klerksdorp, so bit zonked from the drive, going for snooze, see y'all later 
[13:00] <Vince-0> Hi all, inbetween afks at the office here...
[13:09] <Vince-0> yaar! work ends
[13:52] <charl_> interesting article: http://royal.pingdom.com/2012/04/24/irc-is-dead-long-live-irc/
[14:07] <Kilos> ya
[14:07] <Kilos> go freenode
[14:23] <magespawn> so a snooze with two kids who have not seen you for a month not such a good idea
[14:24] <Kilos> lol
[14:28] <Kilos> hiya nlsthzn_ 
[14:30] <superfly> magespawn: fetching the fish from their grandparents?
[14:31] <magespawn> yup
[14:32] <superfly> ah, was wondering why you we're going to Klerksdorp, then you mentioned the fish and I remembered...
[14:32] <superfly> *were 
[14:36] <magespawn> did it in 8 and 1/2 hours, so made good time
[15:08] <smileee> hi :D
[15:10] <inetpro> charl_: nice link
[15:11] <smileee> inetpro: my raspberry pi is running fine :)
[15:19]  * Squirm pops in
[15:20] <smileee> Squirm: :D
[15:33] <Cantide> just put a new m/b + cpu + ram in
[15:33] <Cantide> and kept my HDD and ubuntu installation
[15:33] <Cantide> how do i update my drivers? 'o'
[15:33] <Kilos> graet
[15:33] <Kilos> what socket
[15:33] <Kilos> great too
[15:33] <Cantide> 1155
[15:33] <Cantide> just a cheap i3
[15:34] <Kilos> lekker so you can go all the way
[15:34] <Cantide> with 8 GB of 1600 DDR3 hahaha
[15:34] <Cantide> well, Intel is bringing out the 1150 socket in about 6 months
[15:34] <Cantide> so this PC will go to my dad when I build a nice one :)
[15:34] <Kilos> larger cpus are expensive
[15:34] <Cantide> that they are
[15:34] <Cantide> but worth it if you have the money
[15:35] <Kilos> if you have ya
[15:35] <Kilos> i will try save for a 1155 mb in this year
[15:35] <Cantide> i bought a cheap one - R 500
[15:35] <Cantide> MSI H61 board
[15:35] <Kilos> at matrix
[15:35] <Kilos> ?
[15:36] <Cantide> the Asus Z77 looks a lot nicer, but for R 2 000 it's a bit much for me now
[15:36] <Cantide> especially since i won't be keeping this one
[15:36] <Cantide> no, at PC Zone
[15:36] <Cantide> it's a local Durban store only
[15:36] <Cantide> well, Pinetown / Ballito / Musgrave
[15:36] <Kilos> n ice to see you thinking about your dad
[15:36] <Kilos> good boy
[15:36] <Cantide> yeah, and in the meantime he will use the one i was using, but it's a bit slow
[15:36] <Kilos> there is sahara computers in durbs
[15:37] <Cantide> yes
[15:37] <Cantide> in Springfield Park iirc
[15:37] <Cantide> but i'm not a fan of Sahara
[15:37] <Kilos> they used to be quite cheap
[15:37] <Kilos> being wholesalers too
[15:37] <Cantide> cheap isn't always good :p
[15:37] <Kilos> no man they sell the same stuff
[15:38] <Cantide> sometimes :p
[15:38] <Kilos> but often at wholesale prices
[15:38] <Kilos> o hope you putting ubuntu on it
[15:39] <Cantide> of course!
[15:39] <Kilos> well done
[15:40] <magespawn> Cantide: 64 bit?
[15:41] <Cantide> umm
[15:41] <Cantide> should i?
[15:41] <Kilos> doesnt 64bit use more resources
[15:42] <magespawn> 64 bit handles the more ram better if i am right
[15:42] <Cantide> oh..
[15:42] <Cantide> i have 8 GB
[15:42] <Cantide> and OS is picking it up
[15:42] <Cantide> PAE kernel <3
[15:43] <magespawn> maybe that was changed or i am getting my os's confused
[15:44] <Cantide> trying to get help in #ubuntu
[15:44] <Kilos> eeek
[15:44] <Kilos> concentrate
[15:47] <Cantide> i might need to reboot..
[15:53] <Squirm> magespawn: you have to have a PAE kernel for > 4Gb
[15:54] <Squirm> and Cantide, Sahara has moved location
[15:54] <Squirm> they're now off Queen Nandi
[15:54] <Cantide> aah
[15:54] <Cantide> Omega is also there
[15:54] <Cantide> .-.
[15:54] <Cantide> too far for my liking haha
[15:54] <Squirm> a friend of mine used to run PC Zone in Cato Ridge
[15:55] <Squirm> well, friends brother
[15:55] <Squirm> Cantide: where do you live?
[15:55] <magespawn> typical linux being so far ahead
[15:56] <Cantide> Squirm, Queensburgh
[15:56] <Cantide> you?
[15:56] <Squirm> Mooi River
[15:56] <Cantide> PC Zone in Cato Ridge is not the same as the ones in Pinetown / Ballito / Musgrave
[15:56] <Squirm> PAE, iirc, stands for Physical Address Extension - Little piece of knowledge
[15:56] <Cantide> must be another store altogether that happens to have the same name
[15:56] <Squirm> there's also a PC Zone in pmb
[15:57] <Squirm> which are linked afaik
[15:57] <Squirm> so maybe PC Zone is kind of, franchising?
[15:57] <magespawn> and in Ballito
[15:57] <Squirm> a guess, I really don't know
[15:58] <Cantide> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1844354 found a solution! hah!
[15:58] <Cantide> Squirm, they are not franchising
[15:58] <Cantide> i worked for them when they had just one store in Pinetown
[15:58] <Cantide> and i know the owners
[15:58] <Cantide> zones.co.za is their website
[15:59] <Cantide> you will see on the 3 stores i mentioned listed on the site
[15:59] <Cantide> brb, reboot
[15:59] <charl_> haha sudo wrestler
[16:00] <charl_> hi smileee 
[16:00] <smileee> hi charl_ :p
[16:00] <Cantide> yeah!! welcome back to Unity 3D <3
[16:00] <Cantide> the solution there worked :)
[16:01] <Squirm> ok
[16:01] <charl_> smileee: i found an excuse for another trip to belgium in the summer - the japanese garden in hasselt
[16:02] <smileee> charl_: cool :D
=== Kanchi is now known as Cantide
[16:04] <charl_> Cantide: had to look it up on the wikipedia, i see there's a place called "Moseley"
[16:04] <charl_> sounds a lot like "mos eisley" http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Mos_Eisley
[16:04] <charl_> oh, he's gone :S
[16:05] <Cantide> I'm here :)
[16:05] <Cantide> Moseley haha :) that's not too far from where i am
[16:05] <charl_> oh i see now
[16:05] <charl_> a nickname recovery :)
[16:06] <Cantide> yeah, i pinged out because my connection dropped
[16:06] <Cantide> so i came back and my other nick was still hanging around :p
[16:07] <charl_> my irc client (irssi) just keeps appending an _ to the name until it gets one that isn't in use ;)
[16:07] <Cantide> haha
[16:07] <Cantide> i have alternatives
[16:08] <Cantide> 1 choice - Cantide
[16:08] <charl_> but my irc name is the same as my unix username
[16:08] <Cantide> 2nd choice - Kanchi
[16:08] <charl_> irssi picks it up automatically
[16:08] <Cantide> 3rd choice - girin
[16:08] <Cantide> oh, nice :)
[16:08] <charl_> that sounds very asian
[16:08] <Cantide> i don't want to come online as "Karl" .-. that would be weird i think
[16:08] <Cantide> it is Korean for "giraffe" haha
[16:08] <Cantide> 기린
[16:08] <charl_> no that would be german :)
[16:08] <Cantide> :)
[16:09] <Cantide> yes, i have a German name >_>
[16:09] <charl_> karl is my german name
[16:09] <charl_> "karel" is my dutch name
[16:09] <charl_> but nobody calls me either, i have the french variant ;)
[16:09] <charl_> it's actually a dutch name but of french origin
[16:09] <Kilos> poor mixed up kid
[16:10] <charl_> Kilos: you're one to talk :P
[16:10] <Cantide> that is so confusing :p
[16:10] <Kilos> hehe
[16:10] <Cantide> Ich bin nur Karl '-';;
[16:10] <Kilos> i got one nick
[16:10] <charl_> Cantide: welcome to europe :)
[16:11] <Cantide> danke schön '-'
[16:11] <Cantide> took me so long to get that umlaut haha
[16:11] <charl_> it's the same name, but it got different spellings / pronunciations in different countries
[16:11] <charl_> "charles" is the english variant
[16:11] <Kilos> oh i say charles old chap
[16:12] <charl_> yes something like that ;)
[16:12] <charl_> "would you mind a spot of tea"
[16:12] <charl_> with lemon!

[16:13] <charl_> yes cucumber with lime pesto but then it turns into an italian thing ;)
[16:13] <charl_> nice though, cucumber and lime pesto
[16:13] <Kilos> haha
[16:14] <charl_> i often eat oven bread with pesto, cheese and rucola
