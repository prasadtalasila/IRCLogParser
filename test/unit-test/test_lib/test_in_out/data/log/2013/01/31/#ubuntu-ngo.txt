[13:14] <bac> good morning dholbach
[13:14] <dholbach> hi bac
[13:14] <bac> dholbach: have a fun trip over the break?
[13:14] <bac> bkk is great
[13:14] <dholbach> yeah, I could have stayed much much longer ;-)
[13:15] <bac> do you got pickpocketed?
[13:15] <bac>  s/do/so
[13:16] <dholbach> ah, that was back home again
[13:16] <dholbach> it was my birthday party in a small club when I noticed that when we closed shop that my wallet was gone
[13:16] <dholbach> the most annoying part was getting all the cards again and running from one office to another and calling the bank and others
[13:16] <dholbach> but I survived :)
[13:18] <bac> glad it wasn't while traveling
[13:19] <dholbach> yeah, that wouldn've been worse :)
[13:19] <dholbach> but yeah, Thailand is going to see me again, I'm sure of it
[13:23] <dholbach> how are you doing?
