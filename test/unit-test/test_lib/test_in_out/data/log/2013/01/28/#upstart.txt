[10:18] <afournier> is possible to pass an env var from pre-start to exec ?
[10:40] <jodh> afournier: the next release will support this, but for now, you'll need to use temporary files or configuration files or similar.
[10:44] <afournier> i put the exec inside script and that'll do it
[11:09] <xnox> afournier: that works too.
