[06:11] <Walther> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1548274/
[06:12] <Walther> I'm not sure that's a good thing.
[06:12] <Walther> didn't fix with apt-get -f install either
[06:12] <Walther> Suggestions are welcome
[06:13] <gnomefreak> Walther: thanks for sonfirming it
[06:14] <Walther> ah, a more common issue then / broken package
[06:14] <gnomefreak> Walther: did you try --configure?
[06:15] <Walther> walther@affogato:~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure xdiagnose
[06:15] <Walther> /usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure: xdiagnose is broken or not fully installed
[06:16] <gnomefreak> i guess im filing  bug report
[06:38] <gnomefreak> Walther: canyou please read and comment on bug 1101688. [;ease add what happejned to you please,
[06:38] <ubottu> bug 1101688 in dpkg (Ubuntu) "during a regular upgrade of ht updated packages. in Raring" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1101688
[06:48] <Walther> confirmed, commented
[06:49] <Walther> also, it's pretty clearly xdiagnose issue, not dpkg
[06:49] <Walther> "SyntaxError: ('invalid syntax', ('/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/xdiagnose/welcome.py', 219, 32, ' "--height=480")\n'))"
[06:49] <Walther> also, heh, now that's a way to say hi and welcome :P
[06:56] <gnomefreak> Walther: yeah i forgot abou that. thanks for updateing the bug report
[06:56] <Walther> no probs
[08:24] <rigo> hi
[08:25] <rigo> just one stupid question: can i install the os from an sd card what contains an iso file? so can the uefi bios extract it?
[10:07] <alankila> hey, tried to boot raring ringtail this morning and found out that 3.8.0-1 kernel can't read the initramfs and the boot fails there
[11:30] <alankila> boot issue solved. Was because / and (boot) was on XFS, and I rebooted too quickly, causing filesystem consistency issues wrt to grub's XFS driver. I guess I'll drop that FS.
[12:31] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[12:52] <dupondje> Hmz, Its not supported to copy a file from 1 gvfs mount to another ?
[14:49] <FernandoMiguel> anyone having DNS problems on +1 ?
[14:49] <FernandoMiguel> two laptops, fully updated, different networks
[14:49] <FernandoMiguel> continues timeouts and dns failed responses
[14:50] <FernandoMiguel> some more network intensive apps complain a lot.... anything video streaming related, like skype, g+ hangouts, pidgin... etc
[15:23] <elhoir> hi there,
[15:23] <elhoir> i have installed pulseaudio 3.0 via the audio dev team ppa
[15:24] <elhoir> using ubuntu raring 13.04
[15:24] <elhoir> and today i got this
[15:24] <elhoir> http://pastebin.com/Ku0hkAmB
[15:25] <elhoir> any idea?
[15:38] <john__> Hello, are transparency issues of panel in Kubuntu 13.04 / KDE 4.10 B1 a know issue ?
[15:38] <john__> I am talking about this
[15:38] <john__> http://imgur.com/a/QS5Gs
[15:39] <BluesKaj> john__, ^ so there may be some otherfixes that may affect you but unfortunately a reboot is required
[15:40] <john__> no problem, I got warned about living on the edge
[15:44]  * elhoir still prefers GNOME 3 rather than KDE 4 for the desktop :)
[15:48] <john__> BluesKaj what are those fixes? During setup I got warned about a broken pixelcache but it seems only to affect gtk apps
[15:49] <john__> BluesKaj gtk-pixbuf or so, but that doesn't sound like the transparency issues I see with panel and widgets
[15:51] <BluesKaj> sorry john__ I was speculating on whether your issue was affected , it was on the off-chance the upgrade mu=ight fix it ...my issues seem to be fixed now

[15:54] <FernandoMiguel> anyone knows what's this on /boot?
[15:58] <BluesKaj> FernandoMiguel, got any encrypted partitons ?
[15:59] <FernandoMiguel> BluesKaj: nope... I suspect its remains from ChromeOS
[15:59] <BluesKaj> aha
[15:59] <FernandoMiguel> but why it would write on another OS /boot, beats me
[15:59] <BluesKaj> same here , no clue
[16:10] <elhoir> any idea about this? ---> http://pastebin.com/Ku0hkAmB
[16:33] <BluesKaj> BBL, gotta push some snow
[16:42] <elhoir> hello again
[16:42] <elhoir> what does this dmesg line mean?
[16:42] <elhoir> [   16.808632] microcode: failed to load file amd-ucode/microcode_amd.bin
[16:42] <elhoir> is it a bug?
[18:33] <penguin42> hmph, what's up with kvm networking on todays update
[18:37] <BluesKaj> hey penguin42 , kvm networking ,... how do you mean ?
[18:38] <penguin42> BluesKaj: Guests aren't getting networking today
[18:38] <BluesKaj> ok
[18:39] <penguin42> hmph, restarting all the bits I can think of doesn't help
[18:39] <penguin42> hmm
[18:40] <BluesKaj> used 12.10 install to upgrade to 13.04 , the 3.8 kernel is ok , kwin is so-so , as is the 310.19 nvidia driver I was advise to install
[18:40] <penguin42> ah, at least you've got the thing to boot at last
[18:40] <BluesKaj> er advised
[18:41] <BluesKaj> yeah ..it was ubiquity thatr was stalling out
[18:44] <BluesKaj> thay was a fairly big update/upgrade today , at least ti fixed the missing toolbar and menubar on my app windows
[18:48] <penguin42> yeh I suspect my networking problems are due to that, I'll reboot in a few mins to see if that fixes it
[19:03] <penguin42> hmm, ok after a reboot
[19:09] <om26er> my wifi keeps disconnecting anyone else face that on raring ?
[19:23] <PatrickDK> om26er, intel wifi?
[19:24] <om26er> PatrickDK, its Network controller: Atheros Communications Inc. AR9485 Wireless Network Adapter
[19:24] <om26er> so not intel I guess ?
[19:24] <PatrickDK> dunno :) for me, it's been never ending issue with intel wifi chipset, since 9.10
[19:25] <PatrickDK> and not the same system, it's a known intel driver issue
[19:25] <PatrickDK> but dunno about atheros
[19:26] <alankila> I have had good experience with ath9k based card for a few years. Almost never fails. Have copied like 1 TB of data wirelessly without interruption at best.
[19:27] <alankila> It's AR5418/AR5008 based adapter. Some d-link device iirc. It took almost a year before it started to work in ubuntu though because of some register programming error that took long time to get fixed
[19:27] <om26er> alankila, it has worked perfectly fine on this machine from 12.04 to 12.10 I guess it will get fixed in raring as time passes
[19:27] <alankila> the 3.7.0 kernel could not use my other 5 GHz ralink rt2800 card at all, but 3.8.0-1 appears to work again
[19:29] <alankila> that did not work yet on 12.04, so I'm pleased about progress on this front
[19:29] <alankila> that being said linux wireless story is very much a hit-and-miss kind of thing
[19:45] <bjsnider> alankila, now, that's with the plain kernel module, not with anything like nspluginwrapper or something right?
[19:54] <alankila> yep
[19:54] <alankila> I have not ever used the ndiswrapper successfully
[19:55] <alankila> I also had some broadcom card that crashed on the open source driver, but luckily the driver available with jockey allowed that one to work. The open source driver would hard-freeze the machine in about 1 minute or so
[19:57] <alankila> so, to summarize, I don't think it has yet happened that wlan would have just worked with linux :-/ but nevertheless, usually after waiting a year or two, it has started working, so no complaints now

[20:27] <Bluefoxicy> i used to use ndiswrapper because it was the only way to get wifi
[20:27] <Bluefoxicy> but I thought it had become obsolete

[23:30] <mrmcq2u> hey, could someone point me towards a pulse dev
[23:30] <mrmcq2u> or sound indicator dev
[23:34] <bjsnider> the closest we have would be themuso
[23:34] <bjsnider> he's in some other channels
