[00:31] <yofel> penguin42: if it's completely transparent then the blur effect is probably not working. An alternative would be a different plasma theme if blur doesn't work
[00:31] <penguin42> yofel: It's bluring, but the problem is it's just blurring black, so getting no contrast
[00:32] <yofel> meh
[00:33] <penguin42> yofel: The font in the menu is black, and being mostly transparent whatever colour it's going to be it's going to be the wrong one
[00:35] <yofel> now I wonder if we really don't have a setting to disable transparency in plasma themes o.O
[00:36] <yofel> disabling effects completely isn't much of a workaround
[00:39] <penguin42> yofel: Hmm interesint
[00:39] <penguin42> My Desktop theme is air, yet the 'Translucent background' bit was set to Oxygen transparent background
[00:39] <yofel> o.O
[00:40] <yofel> I was just going to ask, because Air is at worst dark-grey here on Konsole
[00:40] <penguin42> and that's a lot better; it's only a vaguely transparent menu - where as the Oxygen one was frankly well almost transparent
[00:40]  * penguin42 wonders hth that happened
[00:41] <yofel> set and forget? ^^
[00:41] <penguin42> I don't even remember seeing that section, so it's possible I forgot it really well
[02:19] <Bluefoxicy> well
[02:20] <Bluefoxicy> puppet 3.0 won't go into Debian Sid until after the next release
[02:20] <Bluefoxicy> because they're in feature freeze for their next stable
[02:20] <Bluefoxicy> this seems dumb.  If you update unstable, you cannot have a separate update that goes into testing
[02:28] <yofel> and putting it into experimental isn't an option?

[21:08] <Phosphate> Does anyone have experience with 13.04 on a Nexus 7? Is it possible to use the soft keyboard during setup or do you need a micro usb host adapter for a keyboard?
[22:42] <ironhalik> anyone can tell me anything about 13.04 battery life as compared to 12.10?
