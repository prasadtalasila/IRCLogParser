[15:03] <scott-work> that does mark a major milestone :)
[15:04] <zequence-w> Much credit to apw, who has been assisting me
[15:04] <zequence-w> I've been documenting my workflow here https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/KernelMaintenance
[15:04] <zequence-w> This is just updating the source, but I'm supposed to spin the package too next time
[15:05] <zequence-w> Just that if we want changes done to the development release, we need to send patches to apw
