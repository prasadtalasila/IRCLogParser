[00:26] <kako_> hi i'm trying to watch a movie on dragon player
[00:26] <kako_> it's slow and choppy
[00:26] <kako_> i'm on an imac g5 2.0ghz powerpc single core ati radeon 9600pro 128mb with 1.4gb ram
[00:27] <KimLaroux> use VLC
[00:27] <kako_> thanks
[00:28] <KimLaroux> it's the best video player on Linux
[00:28] <Obsidian1723> +1
[00:28] <kako_> why isn't it shipped with all distros then, why is dragon player the default?
[00:28] <KimLaroux> if you have problems with it, then you have a serious problem ;)
[00:29] <KimLaroux> probably a question of licenses
[00:29] <KimLaroux> I thnk VLC uses a bunch of proprietary libraries
[00:30] <kako_> ok
=== pete_ is now known as Guest6149
[00:33] <kako_> ok so i think i installed it
[00:33] <kako_> but i can't find it
[00:34] <Obsidian1723> locate vlc
[00:34] <Obsidian1723> that whill show the path to it.
[00:34] <kako_> how?
[00:34] <Obsidian1723> In your terminal
[00:35] <mandoguit> should be in   Menu -> Multimedia     too
[00:35] <Obsidian1723> In your terminal, type: locate vlc
[00:36] <kako_> thanks
[00:36] <kako_> but it isn't in multimedia
[00:40] <mandoguit> if it's installed, it will run from a terminal       type   vlc       or as Obsidian1723 says you can locate the location and then use the full path.     Another command you can use is the   which   command....  therefore you would type    which vlc     that will also show you where the vlc program was installed
[00:41] <mandoguit> o_o
[00:42] <kako_> all "locate vlc" does is show me a .desktop file
[00:42] <KimLaroux> kako_: it's normal that a freshly installed program doesn't show up in the menus. It'll be there at next login
[00:43] <mandoguit>  if it's installed, it will run from a terminal       type   vlc       or as Obsidian1723 says you can locate the location and then use the full path.     Another command you can use is the   which   command....  therefore you would type    which vlc     that will also show you where the vlc program was installed
[00:43] <kako_> i don't think it was all the way installed though
[00:43] <KimLaroux> it should start from a terminal though, or the start-up box thingy that I always forget the name
[00:43] <kako_> cause it seems to be just that one .desktop file
[00:44] <mandoguit> if you are only seeing the desktop file when using the locate command then more than likely the install was broken.   try uninstalling and then reinstalling again
[00:45] <kako_> ok
[00:45] <KimLaroux> should you not updatedb for locate to find it?
[00:45] <KimLaroux> though it should start using the command "vlc"
[00:45] <mandoguit> can try that but that should have been updated on install
[00:46] <mandoguit> missing menu item.....sounds broken imho
[00:48] <Obsidian1723> If VLC is still borning up, reconfigure it.
[00:49] <Obsidian1723> sudo dpkg-reconfigure vlc
[00:49] <Obsidian1723> if that fails, reinstall.
[00:49] <Obsidian1723> sudo apt-get install --reinstall vlc
[00:59] <Obsidian1723> kako gave up I guess
[01:08] <kako_> it was broken
[01:08] <kako_> the installer got the core
[01:08] <kako_> and the libraries
[01:08] <kako_> but that was it
[01:10] <KimLaroux> kako_: so does it work now?
[01:10] <kako_> you sending that message froze it but yea
[01:11] <LINKSWORD2> Hello, crowd.
[01:11] <LINKSWORD2> Darkwing: We meet again. lol
[01:12] <LINKSWORD2> I'm trying to install Firefox from the installer on Kubuntu, but I'm getting an error:
[01:12] <LINKSWORD2> The package "firefox-kde-support" has not been found among your software sources. Therefore, it cannot be installed.
[01:15] <KimLaroux> have your tried installing the vanilla firefox?
[01:15] <LINKSWORD2> .... huh?
[01:15] <KimLaroux> by apt-get doesn't list firefox-kde-support either
[01:15] <KimLaroux> my*
=== pete_ is now known as Guest32925
[01:16] <KimLaroux> just use apt-get and installe the package "firefox"
[01:16] <KimLaroux> -e
[01:16] <LINKSWORD2> .... Apparently it's an 'https' link, and I can't navigate to it. -_-
[01:17] <KimLaroux> what is?
[01:17] <LINKSWORD2> I decided to navigate to Mozilla's site to download Firefox that way, and it pops up as a secured address.
[01:17] <KimLaroux> ah, probably not a good idea
[01:17] <KimLaroux> just use the repos
[01:18] <LINKSWORD2> My connection through my phone won't allow me to download it that way.
[01:18] <KimLaroux> why not?
[01:18] <LINKSWORD2> It's a free app. lol
[01:19] <Obsidian1723> Try wget
[01:19] <LINKSWORD2> E: Unable to locate package firefox-kde-support
[01:19] <kako_> ok so now it just seems to be pixely and slow and really shitty
[01:19] <kako_> the video
[01:19] <KimLaroux> you're trying to install firefox on your phone trough an app on kde?
[01:19] <LINKSWORD2> kako, watch your language.
[01:19] <kako_> sorry about that
[01:20] <LINKSWORD2> No, KimLaroux, I get my internet to my laptop through my phone, with a free app.
[01:20] <KimLaroux> kako_: maybe the video has a bad quality to start with?
[01:20] <LINKSWORD2> I'm trying to install Firefox on my laptop, and it's not allowing me to download it.
[01:20] <KimLaroux> so it's not a Kubuntu problem
[01:20] <kako_> KimLaroux: it was much faster on dragon for some reason but i can't figure out why
[01:22] <kako_> KimLaroux: maybe it's a graphics issue? as in driver stuff
[01:22] <KimLaroux> LINKSWORD2: you may have to setup apt-get to use a proxy
[01:23] <LINKSWORD2> .... I'm confused.
[01:23] <KimLaroux> kako_: maybe vlc isn't configured properly
[01:23] <kako_> KimLaroux: how would i configure it?
[01:23] <KimLaroux> tools > preferences
[01:24] <KimLaroux> there's a gazilions settings in there
[01:25] <OerHeks> kako_, you said you have  imac g5 with ati radeon 9600pro, is there a graphics driver available ?
[01:25] <kako_> supposedly
[01:25] <kako_> though from what i can find online
[01:25] <kako_> it's already installed
[01:25] <kako_> but i don't know
[01:27] <OerHeks> Tools > System > additional Drivers
[01:27] <KimLaroux> aka jockey
[01:28] <LINKSWORD2> KimLaroux: I need the repo command for firefox.
[01:28] <KimLaroux> sudo apt-get install firefox
[01:28] <kako_> OerHeks: I see that everywhere but i have no idea what that means. the path stuff...
[01:29] <KimLaroux> it's the K menu
[01:29] <kako_> kickoff?
[01:29] <KimLaroux> yeah
[01:29] <LINKSWORD2> E: Package 'firefox' has no installation candidate
[01:29] <KimLaroux> in this context
[01:30] <kako_> ummm there
[01:30] <LINKSWORD2> Will somebody please slap this repo directory? lol
[01:30] <kako_> is no tools for starters
[01:30] <KimLaroux> Systems
[01:30] <KimLaroux> in the classic menu
[01:31] <kako_> ok so i loaded it up
[01:31] <kako_> then i get a window saying jockey crashed
[01:31] <KimLaroux> dude
[01:31] <KimLaroux> your system is being a real pain tonight
[01:32] <kako_> you don't say
=== Jikan is now known as Jikai
[01:32] <KimLaroux> lol
[01:32] <kako_> believe me on mac os x it was worse
[01:32] <kako_> things would crash
[01:32] <kako_> left and right
[01:32] <kako_> which after 5 trips to the apple store i said screw it i'm getting linux
[01:33] <LINKSWORD2> lol
[01:33] <KimLaroux> Linux isn't better
[01:33] <KimLaroux> seriously
[01:33] <kako_> yea it kinda is, there's help!
[01:33] <KimLaroux> I have stuff crashing left, right, down, up and center
[01:33] <kako_> hahaha i suppose so
[01:33] <LINKSWORD2> If you know how to use it right, Linux *IS* better.
[01:33] <LINKSWORD2> Unfortunately, there's more than a handful of misfits in the world.
[01:34] <kako_> yup
[01:34] <KimLaroux> You have limited power to "use it right" when the problem comes from upstream
[01:34] <LINKSWORD2> lol
[01:34] <KimLaroux> if there's a bug, there's a bug
[01:34]  * LINKSWORD2 *Evil Grin.*
[01:34] <KimLaroux> the best you can do is report it
[01:36] <kako_> well on my dell latitude d610 with mint kde none of this happened, but i had to retire that cause the graphics card melted due to a small fan forgetting that it needed to run
[01:37] <kako_> so if i'
[01:37] <LINKSWORD2> Ouch.
[01:37] <kako_> i'm correct pastebin is where we all put the stuff for this kinda stuff
[01:37] <KimLaroux> it's the bin where we paste
[01:37] <KimLaroux> so not to flood here
[01:38] <KimLaroux> paste.kde.org too
[01:38] <kako_> ok
[01:38] <kako_> why does kde get it's own pastebin?
[01:38] <LINKSWORD2> Right? lol
[01:39] <Obsidian1723> kako_:  there's a PPA for Firefox.. also, it has had major memory leaks since 2.0, I switched to Chromium, works great.
[01:39] <kako_> well for any and all who can read error reports, i give you something fundementally short: http://paste.kde.org/657860/
[01:39] <Obsidian1723> but I also have a D610 running :Linux Mint 12 KDE, works fine. 2GB of RAM in it though.
[01:39] <LINKSWORD2> Speaking of Chromium, I need the repo command for that, too.
[01:40] <kako_> mine was 2.5 and i'm working on replacing the graphics card in it
[01:40] <Obsidian1723> sudo add-apt-respository ppa:blah-blah-blah
[01:40] <KimLaroux> segfault, who would have thought
[01:40] <kako_> those things are built like tanks
[01:40] <LINKSWORD2> *head-desk*
[01:40] <Obsidian1723> yeah, not quite a Toughbook, but they are solid.
[01:41] <LINKSWORD2> I remember being a support-tech for the D-610's. Pretty solid, alright.
[01:41] <Obsidian1723> Firefox has nice extensions, but the memory sucking isn't worth it. I';ve seen FF expand up to 4GB RAM on a Win box.
[01:41] <kako_> well i got vlc to run smoothly, can anyone guess what the new issue is?
[01:42] <Obsidian1723> I rarely use my laptop, so someday I'll replace it with a 8GB faster 3-something CPU setup running Kubuntu 12.04 or whatever the LTS is, or maybe I'll just go Debian.
[01:42] <Obsidian1723> what's the new issue?
[01:43] <kako_> it freezed on 1 frame then keeps adding over and over and over
[01:43] <Obsidian1723> VLC?
[01:43] <kako_> yea
[01:43] <kako_> i'm starting to wonder if the imac g5 was built for anything other than images
[01:43] <KimLaroux> man, your system is seriously messed up
[01:44] <Obsidian1723> I think you must have som e sort of hardware issue. I can understand wireless being flakey on Linuxd, but VLC is 10+ years old, it's rock solid.
[01:44] <kako_> i know, it's horrendous! :D
[01:44] <Obsidian1723> iMac?
[01:44] <kako_> yup
[01:44] <Obsidian1723> Hold on... let me get my .45 out. I have 13 fixes for it.
[01:45] <Obsidian1723> You are trying to modify a Ferrari... That's not going to work very well.
[01:45] <kako_> imac g5: 2ghz powerpc single core. 1.5 gb ram. ati radeon 9600 128mb. and 233gb harddrive
[01:45] <Obsidian1723> Yeah, dump the Mac.
[01:45] <LINKSWORD2> I'll take it....
[01:45] <kako_> sure, what've  you got?
[01:46] <LINKSWORD2> I build custom desktops. =)
[01:46] <Obsidian1723> I have a few towers around here... If you're in MN, you can have one
[01:46] <kako_> i'm in me
[01:46] <kako_> ME xD
[01:46] <kako_> still
[01:46] <Obsidian1723> Nice state actually...
[01:46] <Obsidian1723> I like Maine/.
[01:46] <kako_> it's freezing
[01:46] <LINKSWORD2> Last one I built was an ASUS Z77 with an i3 dual-core Turbo.
[01:46] <Obsidian1723> Yeah
[01:46] <kako_> oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[01:47] <kako_> i want
[01:47] <LINKSWORD2> Ivy Bridge.
[01:47] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: Building isn't worth the cost these days for most people unless it's a media server, high end gaming machine or server, or you just want top notch parts.
[01:47] <LINKSWORD2> Customer wanted the best board & processor possible, but asked me to put in a 160GB SATA. lol
[01:47] <Obsidian1723> I remember the days when a 16 megabyte RAM SIMM was $600
[01:48] <LINKSWORD2> Obsidian1723: I remember those days.... *shudders.*
[01:48] <Obsidian1723> Everyone built then and upgrades as much as they could. Your average system was $2,000 back then, so figure about $4,000 in todays money.
[01:48] <LINKSWORD2> Right?
[01:48] <kako_> i remember when the macintosh came out!
[01:48] <kako_> kilobytes of ram, xD
[01:48] <LINKSWORD2> *Faints.* I'm not that old! LOL
[01:48] <kako_> don't have to be
[01:48] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: I need to dial into the BBS at 14.4k and use Z-Modem to download Disk 11 of Windows95a :)
[01:48] <kako_> i'm only 17 and i know enough about computers to fix most things
[01:49] <LINKSWORD2> *Head-desk.*
[01:49] <kako_> i wouldn't use linux if i risked blowing up a machine
[01:49] <LINKSWORD2> I'm a 24-year old IT tech.
[01:49] <kako_> which i've seen done before with someone editing theMAC address xD
[01:49] <Obsidian1723> kako_: When I started computing, Apple was 2 years old, Microsoft 3, Windows didn't exist for 7 years, and the web n0ot for 12. DNS didn't exist for 8 more years.
[01:49]  * LINKSWORD2 *Evil Grin.*
[01:49] <Obsidian1723> I started out on Unix back in 1978
[01:50] <kako_> fun
[01:50] <Obsidian1723> Up until 1986, the 9 NAPs all ran off of a single T-1 line.
[01:50] <LINKSWORD2> *Craps self.*
[01:50] <Obsidian1723> No DNS until then either.
[01:50] <kako_> i wish i'd been around when a 13 inch was considered big
[01:50] <LINKSWORD2> ROFL!
[01:50] <kako_> then i'd be making money by now with my skills
[01:50] <LINKSWORD2> .... *Mind drops into the gutter.*
[01:50] <Obsidian1723> I used a 110 baud modem with an accoustic coupler and a rotary phone you had to put the handset into the modem coupler.
[01:51] <kako_> xD yes!
[01:51] <LINKSWORD2> Help! My mind has a dirty mind and it refuses to be cleaned!
[01:51] <Obsidian1723> Scrrrrrrrrrrrrech! SHHHHHHHHHH boing boing ka shhhhhhhhhhhhht
[01:51] <Obsidian1723> good old days
[01:51] <Obsidian1723> 5.24" flopies, zip disks, syquest disks uin 40 or 88 meg....
[01:51] <Obsidian1723> 5.25
[01:51] <LINKSWORD2> .... Right? lol
[01:51] <Obsidian1723> 3.5" disks
[01:52] <LINKSWORD2> I remember those.
[01:52] <KimLaroux> Obsidian1723: how old are you, if you don't mind me asking?
[01:52] <LINKSWORD2> Kim, are you hitting on us again? :P
[01:52] <Obsidian1723> I'm 45, started in 78 when I was 12, so 35+ years in the game now?
[01:52]  * KimLaroux nods.
[01:52] <Obsidian1723> In March, I'll be 46.
[01:52] <kako_> THIS is why linux is better than windows or mac, the community is fun!
[01:52] <LINKSWORD2> kako_: Agreed.
[01:52] <KimLaroux> Man, the Internet is so young
[01:52] <LINKSWORD2> Not to mention, I got tired of all the over-priced crap.
[01:53] <LINKSWORD2> Kim.... Your turn. :P
[01:53] <kako_> yup
[01:53] <KimLaroux> 24
[01:53] <Obsidian1723> You guys are all spoiled. I didn't have the web, forums, etc to go for help to. No IRC until 1988... I had computer clubs, BBSes, and just had to figure shyte out myself. heheh
[01:53]  * LINKSWORD2 *Evil Grin.*
[01:53] <KimLaroux> IRC was born the same year I was =D
[01:53] <Obsidian1723> Now Im just old, lazy and jaded. gdet off my lawn channel dadcum it *shakes cane*
[01:53] <LINKSWORD2> IRC is a lot of fun.
[01:53] <Obsidian1723> It is.
[01:54] <kako_> I learned java by playing around with a ide
[01:54] <Obsidian1723> I ran a small IRC network for awhile, had a BBS before that.
[01:54] <LINKSWORD2> .... Obsidian, don't make me slap you with my new-age anti-geezer swatter. lol
[01:54] <kako_> xD
[01:54] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: Wait... you'll slap me? For FREE? Normall Mistress Vanity charges me $50 for that.
[01:54] <Obsidian1723> hahah
[01:54] <kako_> :D
[01:54] <LINKSWORD2> LMAO~!!!
[01:55] <KimLaroux> You need to change Mistress
[01:55] <Obsidian1723> yeah
[01:55] <KimLaroux> I can give you phone numbers, if you want ;)
[01:55] <Obsidian1723> Ok.. old skool here... Anyone ever use Undernet back in the 90s?
[01:55] <LINKSWORD2> Ah, yeah.
[01:55] <kako_> undernet?
[01:55] <kako_> that's new to me
[01:55] <Obsidian1723> remember when Wildthan /killed 15k users?
[01:55] <KimLaroux> I used Undernet in 2003, does it count?
[01:55] <LINKSWORD2> I was young, back then. *Slaps self.*
[01:55] <Obsidian1723> WildThang
[01:56] <Obsidian1723> Back whejn X and W were around. He did something funky with @UWorld and killed a ton of users.
[01:56] <LINKSWORD2> I don't remember half the commands in IRC....
[01:56] <Obsidian1723> '03???? Yer new here!!
[01:56] <Obsidian1723> :D
[01:57] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: When I ran my IRC network I had an mIRC bot I wrote connect to a IRC server and I used to issue raw commands for fun
[01:57] <KimLaroux> And it's already a decade
[01:57] <LINKSWORD2> Nice.
[01:57] <Obsidian1723> :NICKSERV PRIVMSG LINKSWORD2: Hey there :) -- would make NickServ message you.
[01:57] <LINKSWORD2> lol
[01:57] <LINKSWORD2> Sounds like fun.
[01:57] <Obsidian1723> I'd make NickServ kill opers on their b-day.
[01:58] <LINKSWORD2> lol
[01:58] <Obsidian1723> :NICKSERV KILL LINKSWORD2: Happy Birthday!!
[01:58] <Obsidian1723> Just like that
[01:58] <LINKSWORD2> LOL
[01:58] <LINKSWORD2> Hehe.
[01:58] <Obsidian1723> I could sniff messages, all sorts of stuff. Logged it all.
[01:58] <Obsidian1723> Like Wireshark for IRC.
[01:59] <kako_> i kinda hate to be "that guy" but i did come here looking for some help and i'm wondering if deinterlacing could help speed up my fps and stuff
[01:59] <LINKSWORD2> Unlike the last time I popped into this room, I'm running Oneric...
[01:59] <KimLaroux> You guys are evil
[01:59] <Obsidian1723> BOFH baby!!
[01:59] <LINKSWORD2> And it appears to be possible for me to upgrade to Precise.
[01:59] <KimLaroux> sure, just format
[01:59] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: do the clean install. UpDATES are of, but upGRADES are always messy.
[02:00] <LINKSWORD2> .... I'm a little dubious. The last time I tried to upgrade, it crashed.
[02:00] <KimLaroux> I always format
[02:00] <LINKSWORD2> .... I'd like to do a clean, but don't have a DVD available.
[02:00] <kako_> thre are like 9-12 options
[02:00] <KimLaroux> distupgrades are just ugly
[02:00] <kako_> why not use read writes
[02:00] <DarthFrog> LINKSWORD2:  I thought you were going directly from Maverick to Precise?
[02:00] <LINKSWORD2> .... Because I don't have them. -_-
[02:00] <KimLaroux> LINKSWORD2: give me and adress I'll mail you one
[02:01] <LINKSWORD2> Frog, it crashed during upgrade.
[02:01] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: telnet bofh.jeffballard.us 666 2>/dev/null |grep --color -o "Your excuse is:.*$"
[02:01] <KimLaroux> I have a truckload and never use them
[02:01] <LINKSWORD2> I had to re-install.
[02:01] <LINKSWORD2> .... Yeah, how'd you know that, Obsidian1723?
[02:01] <DarthFrog> LINKSWORD2:  Lovely.  What a nuisance.
[02:01] <Obsidian1723> I am evil?
[02:01] <LINKSWORD2> .... Where's my Geezer-Swatter?
[02:01] <Obsidian1723> Love the random stuff it spits out.
[02:02] <LINKSWORD2> You sure, Kim?
[02:02] <Obsidian1723> telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl
[02:02] <LINKSWORD2> Or are you hitting on me? :P
[02:02] <Obsidian1723> even more geeky
[02:02] <LINKSWORD2> Obsidian1723: *Facepalm.*
[02:03] <KimLaroux> LINKSWORD2: I think you're feeling lonely
[02:03] <kako_> no not blinkenlight
[02:03] <kako_> s
[02:03]  * LINKSWORD2 *Evil Grin.*
[02:03] <kako_> that's starwars
[02:03] <Obsidian1723> kako_: Good luck on getting it to work on the Mac.It's not an Intel proc in there, and You cvan't go beyond 10.4 I think? for Mac OS X on that CPU.
[02:03] <LINKSWORD2> lol
[02:03] <KimLaroux> aren't macs using intel now?
[02:03] <LINKSWORD2> KimLaroux: Maybe. =P
[02:03] <Obsidian1723> You are basically trying to install Linux on a real oddball, like an Amiga.
[02:03] <LINKSWORD2> .... Yeah, they should be.
[02:04] <Obsidian1723> Realize too, 386 support is no more for the Linux kernel.
[02:04] <kako_> kimlaroux the more modern ones are
[02:04] <kako_> but this isn't modern
[02:04] <KimLaroux> kako_: print cat /proc/cpuinfo
[02:04] <LINKSWORD2> .... And that, is why you fail.
[02:04] <kako_> this is back when 128mb dedicated was top of the line
[02:04] <Obsidian1723> yeah
[02:04] <LINKSWORD2> ..... OMFG
[02:04] <KimLaroux> Ah
[02:04] <LINKSWORD2> Fail
[02:04] <kako_> and ibm still made something other than servers
[02:04] <KimLaroux> I thought it was a recent machine
[02:04] <kako_> it's a powerpc
[02:04] <LINKSWORD2> .... *Snickers.*
[02:04] <kako_> so no
[02:04] <Obsidian1723> Basically if you want it to work, take a month off of work, compile LFS or Gentoo and pray.
[02:04] <kako_> imac is
[02:05] <KimLaroux> LINKSWORD2: could you please stfu?
[02:05] <kako_> nah
[02:05] <LINKSWORD2> .... What's your problem?
[02:05] <KimLaroux> you
[02:05] <kako_> i'll just use it as a storage pc
[02:05] <LINKSWORD2> Jeez, I didn't do anything to you.
[02:05] <Obsidian1723> That works.
[02:05] <kako_> and large display for irc
[02:05] <kako_> what a waste of a display
[02:05] <Obsidian1723> Yeah, I gotta back LINKSWORD2on this one. I haven't seen him be out of line at all.
[02:06] <kako_> maybe i can get an adapter and use it as a vga monitor
[02:06] <Obsidian1723> Maybe.
[02:06] <Obsidian1723> At some point the hardware is just too damn old.
[02:06] <kako_> yea
[02:06] <LINKSWORD2> What's the display type, kako?
[02:06] <Obsidian1723> That's where my .45 comes into play.
[02:06] <Obsidian1723> I've laid waste to a few PCs that way.
[02:06] <LINKSWORD2> .... That's usually when I start running, Obsidian1723...
[02:06] <Obsidian1723> heheheheh
[02:06] <kako_> the 20' 16:10 full hd display on my imac
[02:07] <kako_> but why waste bullets
[02:07] <Obsidian1723> 13-round mags x 12 mags, but it only takes 1 mag and it's a goner anyway.
[02:07] <kako_> why not just slam on them with your fist
[02:07] <LINKSWORD2> Nice. So how would you adapt it to VGA? Isn't it built-in?
[02:07] <Obsidian1723> kako_: fun?
[02:07] <LINKSWORD2> .... that'll work. :P
[02:07] <LINKSWORD2> .... Wow. Huge list of update/upgrade packages in Muon.
[02:08] <kako_> well i did end up breaking the keyboard of a 500mhz ibook g3 by typing on it so yea that should do anythng
[02:08] <kako_> and yea the display is built in
[02:08] <LINKSWORD2> .... Ouch? lol
[02:08] <kako_> but i'm thinking there has to be something that can convert it
[02:08] <Obsidian1723> ya use muon?
[02:08] <kako_> to be a monitor
[02:08] <LINKSWORD2> .... BTW, I honestly wouldn't mind someone sending me a CD or DVD of Precise.
[02:08] <kako_> sure thing
[02:08] <kako_> what bit size
[02:08] <kako_> what distro
[02:08] <LINKSWORD2> Muon comes default with Oneric. That's what I've been able to get working.
[02:09] <kako_> i have 10000s of dvds
[02:09] <Obsidian1723> try this... paste into .bash_aliases and save it, then source .bashrc to reload it, then just type sall and enter in aa terminal to do the string of commands. alias sall='sudo apt-get install -f && sudo apt-get --yes -q --force-yes update && sudo youtube-dl -U && sudo apt-get check -y && sudo apt-get --yes -q --force-yes upgrade && sudo apt-get --yes -q --force-yes dist-upgrade && sudo apt-get autoremove -y && sudo apt-get clean -y && sudo
[02:09] <Obsidian1723> apt-get check -y'
[02:09] <kako_> all rws
[02:09] <LINKSWORD2> I've got a 64-bit capable system, but prefer 32-bit distro's.
[02:09] <LINKSWORD2> Holy crap, Obsidian1723....
[02:09] <Obsidian1723> No need for muon.
[02:09] <kako_> kde i presume is your flavor of choice
[02:09] <Obsidian1723> If you want to be lazy, set a crontab :D
[02:09] <Obsidian1723> yeah
[02:09] <Obsidian1723> for DE anyway
[02:09] <LINKSWORD2> Kubuntu 11.04, currently. 32-bit software.
[02:10] <Obsidian1723> 1q2.04.1LTS 64bit here, 16GB RAM.
[02:10] <LINKSWORD2> I think I'm running KDE 4.1?.... (unsure)
[02:10] <kako_> so you'll want 32 bit kubuntu 12.04 or 12.10
[02:10] <Obsidian1723> 4.9.4 here
[02:11] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: I have a lot of custom aliases and do other things like make my prompt turn a different color when at root.
[02:11] <LINKSWORD2> I prefer the LTS versions. Not impressed with the minor changes between xx.04 and .10.
[02:11] <Obsidian1723> Yeah, the non LTS are less stable.
[02:11] <LINKSWORD2> I think they're marked as STS's, (Short-Term Support) ??
[02:11] <Obsidian1723> 6 months
[02:11] <kako_> i've never used non lts cause i usually install for the long term
[02:12] <Obsidian1723> supposedly at 14.04 LTS will go away and Ubuntu will become a rolling distro.
[02:12] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/914191/install-script/bash_aliases
[02:12] <Obsidian1723> Last I vchecked, I have something like 250 custom aliases?
[02:12] <kako_> what happened to 13.04 and 13.10?
[02:12] <LINKSWORD2> When I use an STS, it's because it's the version I have available to me, and I upgrade to the nearest LTS pretty much immediately.
[02:12] <Obsidian1723> nt out yet
[02:13] <Obsidian1723> The 1st # is the year, the 2nd # is the month
[02:13] <LINKSWORD2> .... WTF? Holy....
[02:13] <kako_> then why bring up 14.04?
[02:13] <LINKSWORD2> Obsidian1723: Mind explaining that link's contents?
[02:13] <Obsidian1723> So 13.10 is 20(13) October (10th month)
[02:13] <Obsidian1723> Just my aliases. You were shicked at the sall one.
[02:14]  * LINKSWORD2 *Head-desk.*
[02:14] <Obsidian1723> I brought up 14.04 to say that eventually there won't be a non-LTS and LTS, it will all be rolling, like CentOS is.
[02:14] <LINKSWORD2> Haven't seen anything about that.
[02:15] <LINKSWORD2> .... So, it'll upgrade immediately when there's new packages available for it?
[02:15] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: Lazy Linux geeks use aliases, crontab, have logs monitored and get emailed. It's our way.
=== rysiek|pl is now known as rysiekpl
[02:15] <LINKSWORD2> .... Yep. I need a Geezer-Swatter.....
[02:15] <Obsidian1723> Well the rolling thing is still a pretty new idea, we'll see if they actually do it.
[02:15] <LINKSWORD2> *Grin.*
[02:15] <kako_> has anyone ever stopped to wonder why they didn't build all the linux distros on the same unix core?
[02:15] <Obsidian1723> Longer the beard, the harder the core. Santa is a newbie :D
[02:16] <Obsidian1723> kako_: Different philosophy of design. Same kernekl. All source for really 3 distros... Slackware, Debian and Red Hat.
[02:16] <Obsidian1723> Ever see the Linux Timeline?
[02:16] <kako_> i know but why 3 different ones
[02:17] <Obsidian1723> http://futurist.se/gldt/
[02:17] <kako_> cause couldn't they have all used either debian, red hat, or slackware and gone from there
[02:17] <Obsidian1723> Those are the 3 oldest.
[02:17] <kako_> hell why not just linux os
[02:17] <kako_> instead of ubuntu, mint, fedora, apache, blah blah blah
[02:18] <Obsidian1723> Well, to some Linux is the kernel, to others it's the OS/distro.
[02:18] <Obsidian1723> apache is a web server httpd daemon, not a distro. The rest are all forks.
[02:18] <kako_> ok well apache is still considered linux
[02:19] <kako_> but still why not all one single os
[02:19] <kako_> why the massive distro variation
[02:19] <LINKSWORD2> Well.... I'm gonna go pop a smoke.
[02:19] <kako_> i mean xfce. kde, and gnome are nice choices to hav
[02:19] <Obsidian1723> Debain was forked into Ubuntu, which was forked into Mint. Fedora is a Red Hat fork and is like the unstable versions of Ubuntu, whereas CentOS, also a Red Hat fork, is more stable and is more akin to Debian or Ubuntu LTS.
[02:19] <Obsidian1723> kako_: Different philosophy of design, thats why.
[02:20] <kako_> ok so why not the same thing with windows
[02:20] <kako_> or mac
[02:20] <kako_> especially mac
[02:20] <kako_> mac is unix after all
[02:20] <Obsidian1723> If you want totally free, stable, older software, Debian. If you want newer, less free stuff, newer software, Ubuntu. If tyou want Ubuntu with all the video etc codes, all the extra,s Linux Mint.
[02:20] <Obsidian1723> Mac is not pure Unix. It's been approved as such, but it's not SCO or System V.
[02:20] <kako_> it is unix at the core
[02:21] <Obsidian1723> OS X is a hybrid mix of NetXTstep and FreeBSD. FreeBSD is a fork of real Unuix.
[02:21] <kako_> once again
[02:21] <kako_> still unix
[02:21] <Obsidian1723> It's agreed to be under the Unix umbrella, but it is not pure Unix.
[02:21] <kako_> well no
[02:21] <Obsidian1723> Go work with AIX, then tell me Mac OS X is like Unix.
[02:21] <kako_> aix?
[02:22] <Obsidian1723> AS/400 mainframe OS.
[02:22] <Obsidian1723> real Unix.
[02:22] <Obsidian1723> SCO, System V, AIX, etc.
[02:22] <kako_> i don't have a mainframe to run it on
[02:22] <kako_> don't get me wrong
[02:22] <kako_> i love learning new things
[02:22] <kako_> but mac is unix
[02:23] <Obsidian1723> I'm just saying, after you run the real deal, you'll see OS X ain't real Unix. They call it that, so yes, it is Unix, but not really. Not to a real Unix programmer, geek, etc old schooler. They can call it a fluffy bear, doesn't make it so.
[02:23] <Obsidian1723> Even at the kernel level, Linux, Unix, BSD, Mac OS X and Windows are all different.
[02:24] <kako_> windows is dos
[02:24] <Obsidian1723> but hey, I've new, only been at this almost 4 decades, what do I know?
[02:24] <kako_> :D you should know quite a bit
[02:24] <kako_> but i work with macs a lot
[02:24] <Obsidian1723> Windows is dos? Now yer trollin
[02:24] <kako_> windows is dos
[02:24] <Obsidian1723> Good lord.
[02:25] <kako_> have you never stripped an os before?
[02:25] <Obsidian1723> Windoes isnt DOS.
[02:25] <kako_> yes it is
[02:25] <kako_> it's different than the initial dos
[02:25] <kako_> but it is dos
[02:26] <kako_> and mac is unix
[02:26] <kako_> and linux is unic
[02:26] <kako_> and linux is unix
[02:26] <kako_> mac is a heavily modified and warped unix
[02:27] <kako_> but after you take the gui away
[02:27] <kako_> and the failsafes
[02:27] <Obsidian1723> MS-DOS was fgorked from QDOS which Bill Gates pu8rchased and transformed into MS-DOS. Windows was an optional DE which could run on top of MS-DOS, back in the Windows 1.0 - 3.1.1 days,but once Windows095 came out (which ran under DOS 7.0), that was the last of DOS. 6.2.2 was the last real DOS. Now there really isn't DOS per se, no real DOS. There's a POSIX subsystem, there is DOS compatability, but no real DOS.
[02:27] <Obsidian1723> Linux ins't Unix either. Good lord. Did you just get some IT cert or something?
[02:28] <kako_> no
[02:28] <kako_> as i said
[02:28] <kako_> i'm 17
[02:28] <Obsidian1723> then stop being so efeen clueless man.
[02:28] <kako_> i wish i had an it cert
[02:28] <Obsidian1723> Seriously, if you said that stuff in some other channels on other networks, they'd hand ye butt to ya.
[02:29] <kako_> hahahahaa
[02:29] <kako_> it's true though
[02:29] <Obsidian1723> Go on EFNET once :D
[02:29] <LINKSWORD2> Linux was built under the GNU license, which stands for "Gnu is Not Unix".
[02:29] <LINKSWORD2> Originally, at least.
[02:29] <kako_> xD
[02:29] <Obsidian1723> Recursive names are geek fun
[02:29] <kako_> yes they are
[02:29] <LINKSWORD2> Right?
[02:30] <kako_> you are so simple
[02:31] <kako_> you searched for gnu
[02:31] <Obsidian1723> Hardly.
[02:31] <kako_> not you obsidian
[02:31] <Obsidian1723> No, LINKSWORD2actually has a clue.
[02:31] <Obsidian1723> You can tell when someone is trollin, or is otherwise clueless, uses Google, I thinjk LINKSWORD2 has it down man.\
[02:33] <kako_> i am not using google for any of this
[02:33] <kako_> i've learned it through experience with os
[02:33] <kako_> for example
[02:34] <kako_> unix was built on c++ which was built on c# which was built on a machine running dos
[02:34] <kako_> which means if i were a troll i'd be saying
[02:34] <kako_> mac is dos
[02:34] <Obsidian1723> Ok, who was the partner of Dennis Ritchie and who were they and what did they do?
[02:34] <DarthFrog> kako_:  Unix and C (not C++) are twins.
[02:34] <Obsidian1723> In 5
[02:34] <Obsidian1723> 4
[02:34] <Obsidian1723> 3
[02:34] <Obsidian1723> 2
[02:34] <Obsidian1723> 1
[02:34] <FloodBotK1> Obsidian1723: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[02:34] <Obsidian1723> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand
[02:35] <KimLaroux> LOL
[02:35] <kako_> xD
[02:35] <KimLaroux> fail
[02:35] <Obsidian1723> No fail
[02:35] <kako_> but no c# and unix are not twins
[02:35] <Obsidian1723> So anwser the question then KimLaroux
[02:35] <DarthFrog> Not C#, that's MS technology.
[02:35] <kako_> then why talk about c
[02:35] <KimLaroux> I'm not sure, actually
[02:36] <kako_> when i was talking about c#
[02:36] <kako_> and c++
[02:36] <kako_> and unix
[02:36] <kako_> and dos
[02:36]  * Obsidian1723 noticed neither KimLaroux nor kako_ anwsered my question.
[02:36] <DarthFrog> kako_:  Unix was written in C.
[02:36] <kako_> c++ actually
[02:36] <KimLaroux> Obsidian1723: I'm not pretending to know anything
[02:36] <Obsidian1723> fail.
[02:36] <KimLaroux> failing is the only way to learn
[02:37] <kako_> actually obsidian i don't know either
[02:37]  * DarthFrog thinks kako_ is a troll.  Please don't feed the troll.
[02:37] <Obsidian1723> You guys are making my head hurt. I need to go talk to some Windows users. Far less stressful.
[02:37] <kako_> that's cause most windows users either know a tiny bit of programming
[02:37] <Obsidian1723> DarthFrog: Agreed. Here comes the banhammer on my ignore list for him.
[02:37] <KimLaroux> you could go spend some time in ##chemistry
[02:37] <Obsidian1723> nah
[02:38] <KimLaroux> it's always entertaining to go there
[02:38] <Obsidian1723> ah silencio with the banhammer
[02:38] <kako_> btw obsidian
[02:38] <kako_> your question
[02:38] <kako_> they were the group that made unix
[02:38] <Obsidian1723> I guess that's one way to fix stupid.
[02:38] <kako_> at bell labs
[02:39] <Obsidian1723> LINKSWORD2: ok, I need to kick some kids off my lawn. they are putting up pictures of dead penguins. I think Bill sent them. Dagnabbit.
[02:39] <KimLaroux> Obsidian1723: thanks for the linux map, it's nice
[02:39] <KimLaroux> I didn't know SUSE was a fork of Slack
[02:39] <Obsidian1723> KimLaroux: No problem. Save the link, they update it often enoiugh
[02:39] <Obsidian1723> Yeah terhe is just the 3 main ones.
[02:39] <Obsidian1723> Slackware 3.3 was my first Linux actually.
[02:40] <Obsidian1723> ltr all.
[02:40] <KimLaroux> and that Mandrake was a fork of RH
[02:40] <KimLaroux> Mandrake was the first distro I seriously used back in 2003
[02:48] <eshack> hey, I'm looking to upload some files via ftp to my web host, I can't seem to connect with Dolphin, any recommendations?  I was trying with sftp://user@ftp.domain.com:port
[02:49] <eshack> filezilla is outdated, and I can't seem to connect with that either, though on my Mac, it was easy to setup and do.
[02:50] <eshack> tried Dolphin, and Krusader, I really could use a tip here.
[02:51] <eshack> I'm probably doing something dumb, and basic, and overlooking it,
[02:52] <eshack> when I try port 21, ie the standard method, I get: Your connection to this server has been blocked in a firewall.
[02:52] <DarthFrog> eshack:  Try fish://user@....
[02:52] <eshack> DarthFrog: with Dolphin? or Krusader?
[02:52] <DarthFrog> Dolphin
[02:52] <eshack> fish://  really?  is that new?
[02:52] <DarthFrog> No.
[02:53] <DarthFrog> !fish
[02:53] <DarthFrog> Hmm, the bot doesn't know fish.
[02:53] <DarthFrog> It's a KIO slave.
[02:53]  * eshack makes a mental note to buy the bot a pole. :)
[02:54] <eshack> could not connect to host: ftp.domain.com
[02:55] <DarthFrog> eshack:  Is ssh firewalled on domain.com?
[02:56] <eshack> ok, my host instructions tell me to use sftp when possible, as that is more secure, however I'm wondering if that is complicating things, or if I have hounded my host too much, and now it is blocking everthing
[02:56] <eshack> DarthFrog: no, via cli I can get in
[02:56] <eshack> well at least on my mac
[02:56] <DarthFrog> You might need to give your password in the URL.
[02:57] <eshack> let me double check on here via terminal, could I be missing something on here?  openssh?  or something?
[02:58] <eshack> also, as I typed that out, via ssh I connect to a different domain, the actual server name on the shared host, but via ftp it is my domain name
[02:59] <eshack> ahhh, ssh connection timed out, server trouble, or I have been blocked out because of too many failed attempts.
[03:00] <eshack> DarthFrog: is there anything extra I need installed on my box to connect to ssh? or sftp?
[03:01] <DarthFrog> Well, if you can't connect via ssh, you won't be able to use fish (FIles transferred over SHell protocol).
[03:01] <DarthFrog> On your end, all you need is a SSH client.
[03:01] <eshack> ahh, I'm probably missing that.
[03:02] <eshack> I'm not very partial to Moun, can't seem to find it.
[03:03] <eshack> hmm, openssh-client already installed.
[03:04] <eshack> DarthFrog: thanks for the help.  I'm done for the night, I was hoping to just jump on and start uploading, but I will have to work on this later.
[03:20] <ethang> I just installed from a mini-disk, install seemed to go OK, except X11 doesn't work now

[08:27] <sbivol> Aknot: one second, I'm fiddling with this right now
[08:27] <sbivol> stay tuned
[08:27] <shadeslayer> Aknot: which release?
[08:27] <Aknot> ok sbivol
[08:27] <shadeslayer> it should be fixed imho
[08:27] <Aknot> kubuntu 12.10
[08:27] <shadeslayer> see bug 1093220

[08:29] <shadeslayer> Aknot: find transmission-qt.desktop
[08:29] <shadeslayer> you can use dpkg -S transmission-qt.desktop
[08:29] <shadeslayer> and replace Exec=transmission-qt %F with Exec=transmission-qt %U
[08:29] <Aknot> i use ktorrent
[08:29] <shadeslayer> ohhh wait
[08:29] <shadeslayer> sorry
[08:32] <shadeslayer> works for me on raring

[08:35] <Aknot> thanks sbivol
[08:37] <sbivol> Aknot: when the „Choose an application” dialog appears, choose „/usr/bin/xdg-open” and set it to remember the choice
[08:37] <shadeslayer> nvm, I'm an idiot
[08:37] <shadeslayer> I seem to have mis read most of the question :|
[08:38] <sbivol> shadeslayer: you still help a lot of people most of the time, so It's ok :)
[08:38] <shadeslayer> doesn't make me less of an idiot for having misread the question :P
[08:39] <shadeslayer> my brain ran a sed -i -e 's/firefox/chrome/g' -e 's/ktorrent/transmission/g'
[08:40] <shadeslayer> anyway ... gtg, lunch, ciao
[08:40] <sbivol> on a totally unrelated note, why are the mozilla people so plain stupid? I understand that they don't build a qt-based Firefox, but why are they insisting on being stupid? setting the STANDARD /usr/bin/xdg-open is The Right Thing(tm) to do even on Gnome
[08:40] <shadeslayer> heh
[08:41] <shadeslayer> you'd have to ask them :P

[10:16] <Progers> Hi
[10:20] <Progers> after i installed "Video driver for the AMD Radeon and FireGL graphics accelerators" from additional drivers,the desktop effects has turned off i cant turn it on it says"24 desktop effects could not be loaded."i tried to deactivate the driver,but desktop effects still not working.how to turn them back on?
[10:21] <lordievader> Progers: Are you using Xrender or OpenGL?
[10:21] <Progers> opengl
[10:23] <Progers> when i click details he says"For technical reasons it is not possible to determine all possible error causes.""desktop effect system is not running"
[10:24] <Progers> i use Kubuntu 12.10
[10:24] <jussi> Progers: I assume you have restarted, right?
[10:25] <Progers> yes i have restarted the computer after the installation and after the deactivation
=== sem_ is now known as Peace-
[10:30] <Progers> I think i must remove the driver not just deactivate him.

[10:36] <Progers> Hm
[10:36] <Progers> still not working
[10:38] <Progers> any idea how to turnon desktop effects?
[10:38] <lordievader> Progers: Believe the default shortcut was alt+shift+F12
[10:42] <Progers> hm
[10:42] <Progers> now he saying Desktop effects are not available on this system due to the following technical issues:

[13:12] <petersaints> I just noticed that there's a newer version of rekonq 2.1. Will it reach quantal backports? Also Ktorrent is still at 4.2 in the official repos and 4.3.1 is already available. Any plans to backport it?
[13:14] <hateball> mfkzt_: rightclick plasma desktop and add shortcut
[13:15] <tsimpson> petersaints: #kubuntu-devel is the place to ask
[13:15] <hateball> mfkzt_: or rightclick item in the k-menu and add it to desktop
[13:15] <petersaints> ok tsimpson
[13:17] <mfkzt_> hateball: there is no "add shortcut"
[13:18] <mfkzt_> hateball: only add widget or add panell
[13:22] <hateball> mfkzt_: Ah yes. You add a widget, there are shortcut widgets :)
[13:22] <mfkzt_> ok
[13:24] <mfkzt_> there isn't :(
[13:24] <mfkzt_> what's the name of this widget?
[13:25] <hateball> hmmm, I could swear there used to be.... (I dont use desktop icons)
[13:27] <hateball> mfkzt_: you could also use the "quickstart" plasmoid
[13:27] <mfkzt_> it's only the sublime I'm after
[13:27] <mfkzt_> it doesn't install, it just sits in a folder
[13:28] <mfkzt_> therefore is not in menu items
[13:28] <hateball> Right
[13:28] <hateball> You can still point to the executable file using the quickstart plasmoid
[13:28] <mfkzt_> if I could put it there it would be even better
[13:29] <mfkzt_> donno what quickstart plasmoid is... never used it i guess... :(
[13:30] <hateball> mfkzt_: well it's like a little rocket icon
[13:30] <hateball> I am using swedish locale so maybe I mistranslate
[13:30] <hateball> that adds a box on your plasma desktop, that you can customize what sort of shortcuts shows in it
[13:31] <mfkzt_> actually I am using it LOL
[13:31] <mfkzt_> it's on my bottom bar
[13:31] <hateball> :D
[13:31] <mfkzt_> I have couple of icons there
[13:31] <hateball> You can rightclick and add another, then
[13:33] <mfkzt_> yes it opens "known applications" window
[13:33] <mfkzt_> and it's not a known app
[13:33] <mfkzt_> so I browse...
[13:34] <mfkzt_> and error - can't find it ... weird
[13:37] <mfkzt_> that's not right... I just want to add an icon
[13:37] <mfkzt_> not an icon in quicklauncher
[13:43] <BluesKaj> Hi folks
[13:45] <hateball> mfkzt_: I guess someone might know if you hang around for a while longer
[13:46]  * hateball only uses krunner for all the things
[13:48] <BluesKaj> uses krunner to open / edit files or apps not listed in the kmenu

[13:50] <BluesKaj> or upgrade
[13:59] <Aknot> Why the tasks in task manager sometimes automatically change their position? how can i change it to normal
[14:00] <Aknot> Also i uninstalled kwallet and whenever i open chromium it pop ups the kwallet thing
[14:01] <BluesKaj> if you still had kwallet installed you could have turned it off /disabled it
[14:02] <BluesKaj> the tasks in the task manager change positions to accomodate new task IDs
[14:03] <BluesKaj> Aknot, ^
[14:03] <Aknot> i gues i have to reboot to "refresh" the uninstallation of kwallet
[14:04] <BluesKaj> no , just reinstall it
[14:06] <mfkzt_> hateball: krunner / kmenu ?? what are they?
[14:06] <hateball> mfkzt_: krunner is "alt+f2"
[14:06] <hateball> mfkzt_: I bind that to alt+space instead however, and then it's easy to just fire it up and type what you want to do
[14:07] <hateball> mfkzt_: rather than chasing after desktop icons
[14:07] <mfkzt_> cool
[14:07] <mfkzt_> I like it
[14:07] <hateball> mfkzt_: if you turn on indexing you can type filenames etc as well
[14:07] <mfkzt_> typed "sub" and it's already there!
[14:08] <hateball> For my most commonly used applications I have keyboard shortcuts bound...
[14:08] <hateball> But everyone has different workflows :)
[14:09] <mfkzt_> I like this krunner, what about kmenu?
[14:09] <hateball> mfkzt_: Oh I dunno if it's even called that any longer. The large "start-button" thing
[14:10] <mfkzt_> ah right... :)
[14:10] <mfkzt_> hateball: thanks for your help :)
[14:10] <hateball> mfkzt_: You're welcome :)

[14:22] <ramchandraapte> ndrshn: I believe the Kubuntu OMAP isn't tested as much as Kubuntu on x86 PCs.
[14:22] <BluesKaj> right click on the desktop choose "run command" = krunner

[14:26] <ndrshn> i'll try
[14:31] <BluesKaj> mfkzt, sorry i got here after you asked your original question , so I don't know what your "issue" is .
[14:32] <mfkzt> np :) I wanted to add an icon for sublime text to my bottom bar / desktop
[14:32] <mfkzt> st2 is not in app menu either
[14:32] <BluesKaj> to the panel ?
[14:32] <ndrshn> ramchandraapte: i'll try to install ubuntu 12.10

=== pjoe is now known as pjoe_dj
[14:42] <BluesKaj> mfkzt, open the kmenu and type it into the searchbox
[14:42] <hateball> mfkzt: you can rightclick the menu and add a new item. and then rightclick that and add to desktop :p
[14:42] <mfkzt> let's see...
[14:42] <BluesKaj> or drag it into the panel
[14:43] <hateball> well yeah, if that's where it was supposed to go :)
[14:43] <BluesKaj> mfkzt, I use what is called a "launcher" , quicklaunch in this case . It's added by clicking on the little cashew icon on the far right of the panel , then add widgets , then type 'quick' into the searchbar, choose the quicklauncher (double click on it )  then you can drag your icons into the quicklaunch
[14:45] <BluesKaj> you can also move thwe quicklaunch to a convenient area of the panel by opening the panel options with the cashew
[14:49] <mfkzt> now this is wierd... kmenu>applications>development  I see 3 apps there, now what I right click Edit Applications (KDE Menu Editor) I have 7 apps including sublime I've just added manually (but it's not showing up in menu)
[14:52] <BluesKaj> you have to make sure the apps added show the path to the executable file , mfkzt...usually /usr/bin
[14:53] <mfkzt> exe file is in my home/sublime folder
[14:53] <mfkzt> command: '/home/sjzurek/Sublime Text 2/sublime_text'
[14:54] <BluesKaj> mfkzt, you just need to drag the icon to the panel from it's location , no need to add it to the kmenu first
[14:55] <mfkzt> made it!
[14:55] <mfkzt> added in menu - need to SAVE after all ;)
[14:55] <BluesKaj> yup
[14:55] <mfkzt> that obvius that I've missed it lol

[16:12] <pwl> hello
[16:12] <pwl> guys
[16:13] <pwl> I tried to update my current ati vga card driver by terminal
[16:13] <pwl> with these commands
[16:13] <pwl> http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx
[16:13] <pwl> Unofficial Wiki for the AMD Linux Driver *
[16:13] <pwl> lastly I remembered I wrote startx command
[16:13] <pwl> and then I restarted my pc
[16:14] <pwl> lastly I entered my current users password but my user account can not opening :(
[16:16] <lordievader> pwl: Was there an error thrown up during the update/install?
[16:24] <robtygart> Has anyone heard of a USB to audo wire? My audio jack on my laptop is bad I want to hook my laptop to my sound system.
[16:24] <robtygart> I have seen USB ear phones.
[16:24] <BluesKaj> pwl, is the login screen reappearing with empty login and password fields after entering your username and password ?
[16:25] <lordievader> robtygart: They probably had some kind of sound-card on board. There are usb-soundcards available.
[16:27] <robtygart> lordievader: Thanks. I will take a look at a Sound card. I am hoping to get away with an easy fix.
[16:27] <BluesKaj> robtygart, have you tried a different audio cable just to make sure it's the output jack and not the cable ?
[16:28] <lordievader> robtygart: It is not possible to directly connect a jack to USB, usb being digital and jack being analog, you need an Digital to Analog Converter.
[16:28] <BluesKaj> I have to ask the obvious question
[16:28] <robtygart> Yep, the loose connection in the comuter
[16:29] <robtygart> computer*
[16:30] <BluesKaj> robtygart, do you have a coax spdif output it's like an orange rca analog jack altho it's a digital out
[16:30] <robtygart> Its a laptop, it only has two. earphones and mic
[16:31] <BluesKaj> then you would need the coax digital input on your sound system preamp/amp
[16:31] <BluesKaj> bummer
[16:31] <robtygart> Bummer
[16:32] <BluesKaj> no coax spdif out ...that's odd
[16:32] <BluesKaj> check alsamixer in the terminal
[16:33] <BluesKaj> robtygart, sometimes the digitals are on the back of the laptop , not the sides
[16:33] <sbalmos> shadeslayer: Figured out the IMAP IDLE issue with Kontact/KMail late last night. Stupid account "folder" wasn't set by default to inherit the account's sync settings.
[16:34] <lordievader> BluesKaj: I believe many laptops don't have an spdif connection, at least my two HP laptops don't.
[16:34] <pwl> lordievader: do not show error during update/install
[16:35] <BluesKaj> robtygart, if not then as lordievader suggested , a usb soundcard is the only choice
[16:35] <pwl> yeah I got plantronics gamecom pro1 headphone
[16:35] <pwl> it's included own usb sound card
[16:35] <lordievader> pwl: Can you still login to a tty?
[16:36] <BluesKaj> lordievader, sometimes the minii-jack audio out works as analog and digital depending what's assigned in asoundrc or phonon
[16:36] <pwl> I am in guest account now
[16:37] <pwl> still I try to type my password and I can not login :(
[16:37] <pwl> its going on as a loop at the login screen
[16:37] <lordievader> A digital mini-jack, now that is odd.
[16:38] <lordievader> pwl: Try to login to a tty, X is probably broken. To acces a tty press ctrl+alt+F[1-6], to get back to the login manager ctrl+alt+F7
[16:38] <BluesKaj> yeah , I've seen the adapters miniplug to rca coax
[16:39] <pwl> I told these problem one of my friends. He assume PEBKAC problem
[16:39] <BluesKaj> pwl , or nomodeset in grub
[16:39] <pwl> I will try virtual keyboard.
[16:39] <BluesKaj> !nomodeset | pwl
[16:39] <ubottu> pwl: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[16:39] <pwl> hmm ok I try thx
[16:40] <lordievader> pwl: Reading a few logs at this point are probably a good idea... but do whatever.
[16:41] <pwl> how can I read logs
[16:41] <pwl> may be we can find source of the issue if we will read the logs
[16:41] <pwl> right ?
[16:42] <lordievader> pwl: Log in to the tty and run: tail /var/log/syslog
[16:42] <pwl> man sorry I am newbie what does tty mean ?
[16:44] <lordievader> pwl: Read a few lines back.

[22:19] <Frozenthia> I just installed Kubuntu on my brother's desktop, and he has a custom computer with an Nvidia graphics card. The only way I could get past the loading screen where the icons fade in is with alt shift F12 or something.
[22:19] <Frozenthia> After I did that, I installed "nvidia-current," rebooted, and now it black screens with a lot of errors.
[22:20] <lordievader> Frozenthia: alt + shift + F12 disables desktop composition, it needs OpenGL. Have you installed the nVidia driver?
[22:20] <Frozenthia> Yeah. Once I installed nvidia-current, it no longer boots at all.
[22:21] <Frozenthia> Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown wn-block(0,0)
[22:21] <lordievader> Frozenthia: How did you install the driver? Through the jockey/additional drivers?
[22:22] <Frozenthia> I did it through the terminal.
[22:23] <lordievader> Frozenthia: Did you download the binary from the nVidia website and install it in that way?
[22:23] <Frozenthia> No.
[22:24] <lordievader> Frozenthia: How then, what commands did you use to install the driver?
[22:24] <Frozenthia> sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[22:24] <Frozenthia> sudo nvidia-xconfig
[22:25] <lordievader> Frozenthia: Run "sudo jockey-kde" and see what it recommends.
[22:25] <Frozenthia> I can't get into KDE or even a terminal, even through recovery mode. What do you suggest?
[22:26] <Auslin> sudo apt-get purge --remove nvidia-current
[22:26] <lordievader> Frozenthia: Not even through the recovery mode? Boy... because of the kernel panic?
[22:26] <Frozenthia> Yeah.
[22:27] <Auslin> ehm can you ctrl+alt+f1?
[22:27] <lordievader> Frozenthia: Don't think it would do much good but you could try the nomodeset.
[22:27] <lordievader> !nomodeset
[22:27] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[22:27] <lordievader> Or !single
[22:27] <lordievader> !single
[22:27] <lordievader> Hmm... Well that is another kernel option...
[22:27] <Auslin> then log in, then "sudo service kdm stop"
[22:28] <Frozenthia> Oh, I looked at those, didn't know what they were.
[22:28] <lordievader> Frozenthia: In grub when you hit e you can edit the kernel boot parameters.
[22:29] <sbivol> Frozenthia: not being able to mount the root filesystem is a boot problem. maybe you [un]plugged another HDD/USB after installation so that your disk names changed. this shouldn't be a problem, since Kubuntu uses UUIDS as disk identifiers, but maybe you edited /etc/fstab by hand?
[22:29] <Frozenthia> No. I didn't touch anything. The only command after installation was nvidia's xconfig, and then reboot.
[22:32] <Frozenthia> nomodeset did not fix it.
[22:32] <sbivol> I wouldn't suspect the nVidia driver in such a situation. It doesn't touch this boot stage.
[22:32] <Frozenthia> I marked it and booted from disk.
[22:33] <Frozenthia> Did I do it incorrectly?
[22:33] <Auslin> Frozenthia. after booting you cant pass grub?
[22:34] <Frozenthia> Oh, I didn't do it correctly. I'm new at this.

[22:35] <Frozenthia> No, I can't pass grub. It black screens and goes to the kernal panic error, and then I have to manually restart.
[22:36] <Frozenthia> from the edit, nomodeset does not work.
[22:36] <sbivol> Frozenthia: your GRUB menu lists some entries. it should also contain old Linux entries. do you have any of these entries?
[22:37] <sbivol> Frozenthia: I mean, do you have more than one kernel version listed in GRUB on that machine, maybe in a submenu?

[22:37] <Frozenthia> Ubunu, Advanced options for Ubuntu, Memory test/Memory test
[22:38] <Frozenthia> GNU Grub version 2.00-7ubuntu11
[22:38] <Frozenthia> Advanced, Ubuntu with Linux 3.5.0-17-generic and the same but with (recovery mode)
[22:39] <sbivol> try to boot the one under Advanced (without recovery mode)
[22:39] <Frozenthia> Hm, "$vt_handoff" is in the options for the linux boot line in the edit. I didn't remove that when I used nomodeset. I didn't see it in that forum thread.
[22:40] <Frozenthia> Okay.
[22:40] <Frozenthia> Same error.
[22:41] <Frozenthia> Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown wn-block(0,0)
[22:41] <Frozenthia> Pid: 1, comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 3.5.0-17-generic #28-Ubuntu
[22:42] <Auslin> I'd have same problems with nvidia (in my case drvers 173, videocard geforce5200) :\. Finally I decided to install drivers manually, not that hard I just had to enter in console mode and stop kdm, it takes nomore that 4 commands.
[22:42] <Frozenthia> Call Trace: lots of hexes and panic, mount block, initrd, prepare namespace, etc
[22:42] <sbivol> Frozenthia: the only solution that I see would be to boot a live CD, mount your / partition and chroot into it, then reinstall GRUB and the kernel. but that's probably not worth it since you have just installed the system, so it would be easier to reinstall
[22:43] <sbivol> probably faster, too
[22:43] <Auslin> I second the reinstall
[22:43] <Frozenthia> Yeah, I don't mind doing that. But what will I do about the Nvidia drivers? I don't want to freeze at the login anymore.
[22:43] <Auslin> I can help you with manual installation
[22:44] <Auslin> what's the model ogf your graphics card?
[22:44] <sbivol> Frozenthia: I am almost sure that it has nothing to do with that driver
[22:44] <lordievader> Frozenthia: I'd recommend installing the driver through the jockey.
[22:44] <Frozenthia> Not sure at the moment, Auslin. sbivol, you're probably right. I just assumed.
[22:44] <Frozenthia> I'll go ahead and install again.
[22:45] <sbivol> Frozenthia: make sure to reboot at least once the new system, before installing the nvidia driver, so that you will at least confirm for yourself that everything's ok before the driver install
[22:46] <Frozenthia> Good idea. I will.
[22:48] <Auslin> Frozenthia:what's the model of the grapchi card? If any :)
[22:49] <Frozenthia> I think it's the GTX 580, but not certain.
[22:49] <sbivol> Frozenthia: I second lordievader's advice to install via jockey-kde. it's The Right Way(tm).
[22:49] <Frozenthia> Haha
[22:55] <Auslin> and dont use xorg-edgers ppa please :P
[22:56] <Auslin> really not recommended unless you have Intel graphics
[22:57] <Frozenthia> The F12 shortcut isn't working to get me past the fading logos this time.
[22:58] <sbivol> Frozenthia: is it the LiveCD or the installed system?
[22:58] <Frozenthia> Installed. It freezes after the install when it asks me to reboot, too.
[22:59] <Frozenthia> I had the same problem on KDE on Arch, which was a nightmare and led me to Kubuntu.
[22:59] <sbivol> Frozenthia: the freeze after asking to reboot is a known issue, I think. not something to worry about
[23:00] <sbivol> Frozenthia: how does your disk/partition configuration look like?
[23:02] <Frozenthia> I told it to install on the whole disk. I don't know how that stuff works.
[23:03] <sbivol> and you have no other disks in the computer?
[23:03] <Frozenthia> No
[23:06] <sbivol> Frozenthia: when you boot the system, in the grub menu, add the parameter nouveau.accel=0 to the kernel and boot
[23:07] <sbivol> this article talks about the same issue, I think: http://my-blerg.blogspot.com/2012/08/installing-opensuse-121-kde-version.html
[23:08] <sbivol> Frozenthia: this wiki describes how to add kernel parameters: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/KernelBootParameters
[23:15] <sbivol> I don't own that graphics card, so I can't really test anything, but someone on the forums sais he managed to get it working: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=12322423&postcount=4
[23:15] <Frozenthia> : D
[23:15] <Frozenthia> I'll look at this
=== marc_ is now known as Guest58235
[23:27] <Frozenthia> Now grub won't start. -_-
[23:27] <sbivol> what's the error?
[23:27] <Frozenthia> Goes grey for a moment, but just keeps going.
[23:28] <sbivol> if you keep pressing Shift immediately after powering on the computer, does the GRUB menu appear?
[23:31] <Frozenthia> No.
[23:32] <Frozenthia> Anyway, I'm in.
[23:32] <Frozenthia> Finally.
[23:32] <Frozenthia> I just need to get the appropriate drivers that will prevent the freezes but also get me into the OS.
[23:33] <sbivol> Frozenthia: try jockey-kde (Additional Drivers in the menu)
[23:35] <Frozenthia> It won't open this time.
[23:35] <Frozenthia> The icon pops up near the mouse cursor but it never opens.
[23:35] <Frozenthia> It did the first time I installed Kubuntu.
[23:36] <Frozenthia> Oh, it's open now.
[23:37] <Frozenthia> Since nvidia-current didn't work, should I use "NVIDIA binary/Xorg driver, kernel module, and VDPAU library"?
[23:37] <sbivol> if it's there, it is probably safe enough to use it
[23:38] <sbivol> on the othr hand, I have no recent experience with nvidia so you could google it first
[23:52] <sbivol> Frozenthia: good luck and don't give up :)
