[00:07] <solarcloud_3scrn> Dunno what papers in the UK/environ's run sports' issues on a Wednesday   .. but Bradford will be all over them today .. as they're going to Wembley in the League.
[00:09] <neuro> do you not get mainland papers in .uk?
[00:09] <neuro> erm, in .im?
[00:21] <solarcloud_3scrn> neuro: We get all of them , just can't recall if sports is a section in the newspaper on Wednesday, if you read my post .. didn't mention ManxLand.
[00:22] <neuro> virtually every national paper has a sport (not "sports"!) section
[00:22] <neuro> daily
[00:22] <neuro> and bradford is the top story on bbc.co.uk/sport
[00:26] <solarcloud_3scrn> Soz for calling it sports ..it's the first thingy I see most days ... http://goo.gl/a11kR neuro
[00:26] <neuro> scary!

[11:06] <mungbean> ruby on rails popey ?
[11:06] <BigRedS> well, I've not yet got anything against the language itself, but most things written in it seem to be done so poorly
[11:07] <mungbean> i've used RoR and it seems so non-enterprise ready
[11:07] <BigRedS> and it is the language of the devops
[11:07] <popey> yes mungbean

[11:09] <popey> directhex: do you know if it happens with upstream evolution?
[11:09] <TheOpenSourcerer> solarcloud_3scrn: I have nothing to read from Packt at the moment.
[11:10] <rowinggolfer> where to buy a small business server machine?
[11:11] <solarcloud_3scrn> TheOpenSourcerer: Oh, Soo the adverts on the right of www.theopensourcerer.com , are just that, ... adverts.
[11:11] <TheOpenSourcerer> Kind of yeah - They have been there for ages...

[11:18] <BigRedS> einonm: haha, yeah. Python definitely looks a bit like a hyperactive kid from here :)
[11:18] <BigRedS> and it's bloody everywhere
[11:19] <einonm> so what does the aspiring web-type write webpages in these days? Last time I did one, 'under construction' gifs were all the rage
[11:21] <popey> directhex: can you test with a fedora CD?
[11:22] <BigRedS> einonm: whatever they like? >>90% of what we're hosting is PHP.
[11:22] <BigRedS> We are, though, the Debian of hosting rather than the Arch :)
[11:32] <davmor2> wow popey there I was believing that Perl wasn't all that useful and then you go and tell me that frozen bubble is written in it so now my entire universe has been flipped upside down, excuse me while I reboot into windows ;)
[11:33] <einonm> BigRedS:  Hmm. Perhaps I should carry on waiting until all these new-fangled languages go away and someone writes a proper framework in c
[11:39] <popey> haha

[11:58] <knightwise> The classic question : should I enable swap on an ssd ... No .. right ?
[11:58] <popey> i see no reason not to
[12:00] <directhex> no swap = no hibernate
[12:02] <rowinggolfer> ssd aside, is it still swap size should be approx 2x ram capacity?
[12:05] <directhex> nah
[12:05] <directhex> PC will become unusable long before that
[12:19] <brobostigon> cbs action, tribbles, :)
[12:20] <directhex> swap should be enough for hibernate, no more, imho
[12:20] <popey> +1
[12:33]  * BigRedS notes that it never really was a rule that swap be 2 x RAM
[12:34] <gord> if you happen to want to use hibernate, which you might not want to in this day and age
[12:34] <BigRedS> hibernating is a bit like saving a session and powering down, but it takes longer and is less reliable :)
[12:34] <gord> i find it takes a lot longer to read 4/8gb of hibernate from the swap space than to just boot up
[12:36] <BigRedS> I've an md array which is resyncing, is there a way I can find out which disk is being readded? I'm sure I've seen that question answered here before :)
[12:37] <BigRedS> Googling's not being overly helpful, and oddly it doesn't seem to have put that info into syslog
[12:38] <popey> md is dead to me â˜º
[12:40] <Laney> BigRedS: Can you see "RebuildStarted event detected on md device /dev/md..." in syslog?
[12:41] <Laney> I see that for my rebuild yesterday and slightly above that is "md: bind<sdc>" which is the device I readded
[12:43] <BigRedS> Laney: nope. But I do have a handy call trace from ext which pinpoints the broken disk :)
[13:00] <diplo> This isn't a ubuntu question but general none the less, want help finding an answer
[13:00] <diplo> We have an old ERP system, we offer a view before print, this toggles from 80 to 132 in the terminal window
[13:01] <diplo> This works fine in a normal session, if we're running in a screen session this fails.. any ideas how to debug/search for it issues fix as my foo is failing big time atm
[13:05] <daubers> BigRedS: It should say in /proc/mdstat
[13:38] <BigRedS> daubers: yeah, it does when it needs resyncing, but not when it's actually resyncing
[13:42] <BigRedS> https://gist.github.com/4605712 is what it looks like

[19:22] <Azelphur> but I'm not really sure where to get started
[19:45] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: Z-Wave :)
[19:46] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: USB controllers exist (so you can write your own software, Linux driver software exists)
[19:46] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: and wireless switches, dimmers, sensors, etc.
[19:46] <Azelphur> cool
[19:46] <daftykins> Azelphur + USB things = danger

[19:50] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: but you'll have to write your own cron jobs ;)
[19:50] <Azelphur> that's pretty much what I want anyway, I want control over it from the PC.

[19:56] <MartijnVdS> http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave/lighting-sockets :)
[19:57] <Azelphur> ah no, I'm talking about room lights, not ones that plug into a wall
[19:57] <Azelphur> the type of light with a switch on the wall
[19:57] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: look at the bottom of that page
[19:58] <Azelphur> I see
[19:58] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: or top.. they have "inserts" for behind the switch, or complete switch replacements
[19:59] <Azelphur> http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-merten-electronic-switch-wall-socket the stuff at the bottom says it requires a cover too
[19:59] <MartijnVdS> well of course :)
[19:59] <MartijnVdS> that's just the back
[19:59] <Azelphur> it says a Z-Wave cover specifically, and links to a 60 quid product lol
[19:59] <MartijnVdS> they know how to make money
[19:59] <Azelphur> for a total of Â£90 per light, which is steep ;)
[20:00] <Azelphur> unless I only need the Â£27.60 part for it to work
[20:00] <MartijnVdS> maybe you can find cheaper versions in China (but mind the frequency it uses :)
[20:00] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: you only need the Â£27,60 part but it'll look ugly :)
[20:00] <Azelphur> haha
[20:00] <MartijnVdS> also.. sticking your fingers into unprotected power sockets?
[20:01] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: I have these (or things like these): http://www.vesternet.com/z-wave-fibaro
[20:02] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: you put them in the wall (behind the switch or where the wires for the light come out)
[20:02] <Azelphur> cool, wouldn't it be too big to fit though?
[20:03] <Azelphur> unless you dug out more wall for it to fit
[20:03] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: British electricity standards are different from those here in .nl
[20:03] <Azelphur> ah
[20:03] <Azelphur> http://www.uk-automation.co.uk/products/Fibaro-Dimmer-Bypass.html what about this?
[20:04] <MartijnVdS> that's if you want to use one of the dimmers to dim low power lights
[20:04] <MartijnVdS> (LEDs)
[20:04] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: I have one of these in every room: http://www.onlinebouwmarkt.nl/winkel/images/uploads/Centraaldoos%20-%20vierkant.jpg (in the ceiling)
[20:05] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: and similar on the wall where switches/etc are
[20:05] <MartijnVdS> (which you mount to them)
[20:05] <Azelphur> what are they? that just looks like a plastic box to me lol
[20:06] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: they are :) They were put there while the house was being built.. and the wires run from my meter to the ceiling points, and from there to the switches :)
[20:06] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: (yay star topologies)
[20:07] <Azelphur> ah, I can't dig into any walls, I'm renting ;)
[20:07] <Azelphur> I like the idea of that Z-Wave Fibaro I found, just that it doesn't take a proper light
[20:07] <Azelphur> http://zwave-products.co.uk/shop/article_31/MK-Astral-LDF11-WHI-1G-Dimmer-_-Input-Fascia.html?pse=coa this maybe?
[20:08] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: You don't have to.. aren't switches, etc. mounted on boxes like that there?
[20:08] <Azelphur> our switches are mounted on the wall
[20:08] <MartijnVdS> so are mine
[20:08] <MartijnVdS> but they connect to wires _in_ the wall
[20:08] <Azelphur> ah, yea that's right
[20:08] <Azelphur> there are indeed wires in the wall
[20:09] <MartijnVdS> so there's a little hole behind each (set of) switch(es)
[20:09] <Azelphur> yea, but I imagine there's not much room back there
[20:09] <MartijnVdS> those receivers/dimmers are made to fit those holes :)
[20:09] <Azelphur> the one I linked?
[20:09] <MartijnVdS> and.. EU law.. you have 1 or 2 weeks to send them back for no reason ;)
[20:09] <Azelphur> hehe
[20:09] <MartijnVdS> I think that's only a face plate ("Fascia")
[20:10] <Azelphur> ah
[20:10] <Azelphur> yea I'm just trying to figure out exactly what to get, the stuff that you have confuses me on how exactly it operates
[20:10] <Azelphur> I would have thought there would be a simple "replace your light switch with this and now it's Z-Wave compatible" thing
[20:10] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: you can call one (or several) of the companies.. they'll probably know more about how electricity systems work in the UK :)
[20:11] <Azelphur> hehe yea, I'm more trying to figure out how Z-Wave works atm
[20:11] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: 868 MHz :)
[20:12] <Azelphur> well yea, I got that much, you have a USB thing that sends radio signals to <something>
[20:12] <Azelphur> I just havn't figured out what the something is yet
[20:12] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: yes.. switches, dimmers, sensors (it's two-way)
[20:12] <Azelphur> I see
[20:12] <MartijnVdS> "Fibaro" units are like the plug-in ones: they contain a Z-Wave radio (with a unique id)
[20:13] <MartijnVdS> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-wave
[20:13] <MartijnVdS> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-wave#Z-Wave_network_setup
[20:14] <Azelphur> ah I see, the fibaro is much smaller than I thought it was
[20:14] <Azelphur> I'm gonna have a little peek behind a light switch and see how much space is there
[20:15] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_wiring_in_the_United_Kingdom
[20:15] <Azelphur> fun
[20:15] <Azelphur> not touching any wires as of yet, just looking to see if I think it'll fit :)
[20:17] <daftykins> no frying yourself alive now Azelphur
[20:17] <daftykins> well, unless it's video'd
[20:17] <Azelphur> noted XD
[20:17] <daftykins> :D
[20:17] <MartijnVdS> youtube live streaming ;)
[20:17] <daftykins> i wonder if some of my really pointless videos would sell for money to those clipshows
[20:17] <daftykins> Â£250 still :O
[20:17] <solarcloud_3srcn> mmmpphf, I've asked twice whether someone ad seen if *Bradford* were in the papers ( whatever part./section it is) 'cos they beat Villa(Hurrah!!) in the League .. oh well, Don't read ya' newspapers, then.
[20:18] <solarcloud_3srcn> **had
[20:18] <Azelphur> yea, looks like there's a little box back there
[20:18] <Azelphur> might be a bit tight
[20:19] <neuro> well
[20:19] <neuro> this is interesting
[20:20] <neuro> i switched to a new ovh/kimsufi server last month
[20:20] <neuro> only now getting it up to speed
[20:20] <neuro> seems i'm on a gigabit port
[20:20] <neuro> 533Mbit peak at the moment ...
[20:20] <neuro> *boggle*
[20:20] <MartijnVdS> nice
[20:21] <Azelphur> MartijnVdS: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vtmb4zkur21ze94/2013-01-23%2020.18.57.jpg reckon it'll fit?
[20:21] <neuro> 640!!
[20:21] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: yes
[20:21] <neuro> 784!!!!!
[20:21] <Azelphur> cool
[20:21] <neuro> 950!?!!?!?!!?!
[20:21] <MartijnVdS> neuro: 10GigE-port?
[20:21] <Azelphur> so all I need to get started and play around is a fibaro and the USB device?
[20:21] <neuro> MartijnVdS: gig
[20:22] <Azelphur> that should get me control of one light?
[20:22] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: yes.. and maybe a plug-in one
[20:22] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: so you can play around with that as well
[20:22] <Azelphur> hehe, I'll start small and aim for one light, and buy more things if it doesn't end up like my arduino :P
[20:22] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: then buy the plug-in one first
[20:22] <solarcloud_3srcn> .. looks like they got paint in the wires / on the wires too ! Azelphur
[20:22] <neuro> downloads complete, back to kilobit per sec burble
[20:22] <neuro> wow
[20:22] <neuro> colour me impressed
[20:23] <Azelphur> solarcloud_3srcn: yea, this place doesn't exactly pass health and safety, the landlord is in serious trouble
[20:23] <MartijnVdS> neuro: you sound like me when I got 100/100 at home 8-)
[20:23] <neuro> MartijnVdS: :)
[20:23] <Azelphur> I literally had inspectors randomly knock on my door the other day and ask me about the landlord
[20:23] <neuro> the spec for the box says GigE connection, but 100Mbps throughput
[20:23] <Azelphur> and I basically said all the same stuff that everyone else in the block apparently said, nobody is happy, and the inspectors are after him :P
[20:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> Azelphur: I've only ever rented in eire, so I wouldn't know, .... sorry.
[20:24] <Azelphur> hehe
[20:24] <neuro> unless they're not rate limiting inside the ovh datacentres ... maybe that's it
[20:24] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: my upstairs neighbor's house is for sale.. :)
[20:24] <Azelphur> MartijnVdS: haha
[20:24] <Azelphur> maybe one day when I get rich ;)
[20:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> MartijnVdS: Is that in Dutch-land ??
[20:25] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: Itis
[20:25] <Azelphur> MartijnVdS: know of any chinese knockoff / cheaper versions of the fibaro? I had a ebay search but didn't find much.
[20:25] <Azelphur> I find it odd that the light is more expensive than the controller xD
[20:25] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: I haven't looked myself.. a coworker was going on about them :)
[20:25] <solarcloud_3srcn> ok .. is there a marketplatz .. r web address for the adv.ert or sommit ? MartijnVdS
[20:25] <Azelphur> ah
[20:25] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: marktplaats.nl
[20:25] <Azelphur> MartijnVdS: definitely enough info to get me started hunting and learning though, ty :D
[20:26] <solarcloud_3srcn> MartijnVdS: Where is the advert for the property on the net ??
[20:26] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: funda.nl
[20:26] <solarcloud_3srcn> plz be specific,,,
[20:26] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: ah, my neighbor isn't on there I think
[20:26] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: (which is why it's taking so long)
[20:26] <solarcloud_3srcn> oh .. lol
[20:27] <solarcloud_3srcn> strange case o' deja vu.
[20:28] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: they're changing the matrix
[20:28] <solarcloud_3srcn> !dejavu
[20:28] <solarcloud_3srcn> even the .bot is flumixed.
[20:29] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: there's this one.. that's nearby, in a similar building: http://www.funda.nl/koop/alphen-aan-den-rijn/appartement-48654731-saffierstraat-116/
[20:29] <solarcloud_3srcn> opening....
[20:31] <solarcloud_3srcn> You are about 15 minutes from the devil's sister...
[20:31] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: who?
[20:31] <solarcloud_3srcn> my sis.
[20:31] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: in Leiden?
[20:31] <solarcloud_3srcn> Voorschoten.
[20:32] <MartijnVdS> On The Hague side of Leiden :)
[20:32] <solarcloud_3srcn> yep.
[20:39] <solarcloud_3srcn> MartijnVdS: Found it .. Near the Hotel de Gouden Leeuw .. took a while...
[20:40]  * solarcloud_3srcn remembers the ostriches fondly, but that fondly.
[20:40] <MartijnVdS> THAT fondly?
[20:41] <daftykins> http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/23/3908286/thq-dissolved-studios-sold-off-ceo-announces-in-letter-to-staff
[20:41] <solarcloud_3srcn> kinda petulant, If I recall.
[20:41] <MartijnVdS> what's a thq?
[20:41] <solarcloud_3srcn> dunno, game maker ?
[20:42] <MartijnVdS> ah Saint's Row games
[20:43] <MartijnVdS> and lots of licensed titles
[20:43] <solarcloud_3srcn> true.. mostly winblows.
[20:43] <MartijnVdS> mostly console even
[20:43] <MartijnVdS> but TV-show tie-in games etc.
[20:43] <solarcloud_3srcn> true,
[20:43] <MartijnVdS> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_THQ_games
[20:45] <solarcloud_3srcn> Soo, MartijnVdS, as you are near my sibling o' satan, .. Quick question: What's the snow & ice like in Holland at moment ?
[20:46] <MartijnVdS> solarcloud_3srcn: Lots of frozen snow left over from Sunday... but streets & bicycle lanes have been cleared
[20:46] <solarcloud_3srcn> nice ..
[20:46] <MartijnVdS> Walking is.. perilous :)
[20:47]  * solarcloud_3srcn wonders if he should run and Ad. in Delft freecycle for ice spiked shoe-overlays to give to the needy (for a postal price :) )
[20:47] <MartijnVdS> ha :)
[20:49] <solarcloud_3srcn> but seriosly, they are looking for a moderator for that site, if you interested (it's not just delft) .. but you'll prob.ly say No, oh well.
[20:49] <MartijnVdS> I've moderated enough sites. Never again :)
[20:51] <solarcloud_3srcn> Yeah, the only free(cycle) thingy I got in Holland was chippy mayonnaise... & that sucked balls and blew chunks compared to Hellman's diet mayo.
[20:52] <AlanBell> hi nigelb \o
[20:54] <solarcloud_3srcn> :-[
[20:58] <solarcloud_3srcn> AlanBell: We had a guy on the Ubuntu Gcomm .. who was using Win8 .. and couldn't load a UNETBOOTIN file to generate an ISO burning program to install UBUNTU .. What are your thought-s on how to-do this ??
[20:59] <BigRedS> Couldn't load a unetbootin file? in that the installer broke?
[21:00] <solarcloud_3srcn> felt sorry 4 the guy as everyone just told him a stressball .. http://liveusb.info/dotclear/index.php?pages/Tux-Anti-Stress
[21:00] <BigRedS> Did it present an error message?
[21:00] <solarcloud_3srcn> bigBigR: Doesn't seem to load in Win8 .. dunnno never tried it, so I wouldn't know.
[21:00] <BigRedS> okay...
[21:01] <AlanBell> solarcloud_3srcn: got a link to the conversation?
[21:01] <BigRedS> without knowing what happened it's hard to suggest solutions, but either way it's likely a Windows (or perhaps Unetbootin) issue rather than a Ubuntu one
[21:01] <BigRedS> someone here *might* know, but perhaps a Windowsy person would be more reliably useful?
[21:01] <AlanBell> or he hasn't burned the iso in a useful way
[21:02] <daftykins> who are you talking about?
[21:03] <AlanBell> we don't know!
[21:03] <solarcloud_3srcn> some russian on Ubuntu G+comm.
[21:05] <AlanBell> I am unable to locate such a conversation
[21:06] <daftykins> oic
[21:06] <solarcloud_3srcn> +AlanBell, t was days ago .. and not fruitfull either way.
[21:06] <solarcloud_3srcn> **it was...
[21:27] <Azelphur> I'll just put this here... http://youtu.be/ivBpNGwvrpg :P
[21:30] <daftykins> XD
[21:30] <solarcloud_3srcn> Azelphur: I'm thnking he's not for Ben or Jerry, then. ^_^ http://www.magicfreebiesuk.co.uk/search/?search_term=ice+cream
[21:30] <daftykins> i saw the original for that
[21:30] <daftykins> epic edit
[21:30] <Azelphur> hehe
[21:32] <daftykins> :D
[21:36] <Myrtti> ooooo http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nabeesocks/nabee-socks-warm-and-happy-hugs-for-your-feet - for those of us who fly a lot and hate the compression socks...
[21:36] <Myrtti> I might throw my money at Kickstarter and get all four pairs
[21:36] <solarcloud_3srcn> opening...
[21:38] <daftykins> lawl
[21:38] <daftykins> can you not just take your footwear off whilst on the plane?
[21:38] <Myrtti> sure, but how would that help against DVT?
[21:38] <daftykins> well you're meant to get up and move around anyway
[21:39] <daftykins> no need to spend for the same result surely
[21:39] <Myrtti> because there aren't any other reasons for wearing the socks, right?
[21:39] <solarcloud_3srcn> "here at Nabee sock's , We've put warm and hugs into socks." Pleeeease.
[21:40] <Myrtti> I just mentioned it here because I know there's lots of people who travel a lot by air. I happen to need them for another reason too, but ok. Nevermind.
[21:40] <Myrtti> moving on
[21:40] <solarcloud_3srcn> Myrtti: Good try, keep going....
[21:40] <AlanBell> knox in box, hugs in socks. Knox on hugs in socks in box
[21:40] <daftykins> i didn't mean for you to get so defensive Myrtti
[21:41] <AlanBell> daftykins: that isn't the same result at all, pressure is needed, so taking shoes off doesn't provide that, you have to wear small/tight socks to have the effect
[21:41] <popey> Myrtti: nice pitch, shame the mens are only available in black/grey
[21:41] <AlanBell> whether it works or not I don't know, but taking shoes off is not the same thing
[21:41] <daftykins> AlanBell: i didn't mean just the shoe removing for that part
[21:41] <daftykins> nevermind, you lot ruin a simple convo at times =/
[21:41] <popey> although tbh that's probably an advantage, multiple pairs of black/grey rather than lots of random patterns I'd lose â˜º
[21:43] <popey> oh, bum, US shipping only
[21:43]  * solarcloud_3srcn poses consoling gravitational hugs ...
[21:43] <solarcloud_3srcn> \o/
[21:43] <Myrtti> popey: don't pick a perk and pay 10USD extra for shipping
[21:43] <popey> Hmm, April.. could get them shipped to someone and I could pick up at UDS
[21:44] <popey> oh, where does it say that?
[21:44] <Myrtti> https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nabeesocks/nabee-socks-warm-and-happy-hugs-for-your-feet/posts/388915
[21:44] <Myrtti> popey: also Emma Jane in Facebook
[21:44] <popey> ta
[21:45] <Myrtti> "Read all of the words. Ships internationally. Don't choose a reward, use whatever amount you want, plus $10 for international shipping. Send him a message to say what you want."
[21:45] <popey> oh ffs
[21:45] <popey> oh, i see â˜º
[21:45] <popey> i got the "Sorry, the reward you've selected ships within the US only. If you're in the US, click "In the US" below"
[21:45] <popey> hence the ffs before I saw your line â˜º

[21:53] <popey> ooh nice solarcloud_3srcn
[21:54] <BigRedS> Oooh
[21:54]  * BigRedS has a eurostar ticket for fosdem
[21:54] <BigRedS> Conveniently, there's actually two
[21:54] <solarcloud_3srcn> Are you going to delirium ??
[21:56] <solarcloud_3srcn> BigRedS: Are you ?
[21:59] <Myrtti> my eyes glaze over the pitch videos and I just read the actual text...
[21:59] <Myrtti> I suppose I'm a minority member of kickstarter users
[21:59] <Myrtti> in that aspect
[22:02] <BigRedS> solarcloud_3srcn: Is that the 'official' beery thing on the friday?
[22:03] <solarcloud_3srcn> yep.. till 6am on saturday :D
[22:03] <BigRedS> nah, likely not. First time I went to fosdem I could smell it from a mile or so away
[22:04] <solarcloud_3srcn> oh, your a regular ?
[22:04] <BigRedS> not seen fit to get much closer since
[22:04] <BigRedS> ah, no, my first time at fosdem was the year before last
[22:04] <solarcloud_3srcn> mine , 2012.
[22:06] <BigRedS> It just took me way too long to work out when 2012 was
[22:06] <BigRedS> :/
[22:07] <solarcloud_3srcn> Belgium.. mmm Where them /beaches/ at ? https://dl.dropbox.com/u/55128914/Attachments%20Email%20Xchat/Delirium%20at%20the%20back%20..JPEG
[22:09] <solarcloud_3srcn> First lesson of Fosdem .. bring a debit card, not a credit card :)
[22:09] <BigRedS> hahaha
[22:13] <solarcloud_3srcn> BigRedS: Checkout the G+comm. and the couchsurfing group... just to be social, that is.. need any links ??
[22:14] <BigRedS> Nah, going with people from work, so I've definitely *some* people to drink with :) Generally, though, I found that if you walk into a bar and follow the sound of an argument you find fosdem people#
[22:14] <solarcloud_3srcn> k
[22:15] <solarcloud_3srcn> did I miss Jono tonight ??
[22:16] <solarcloud_3srcn> I get a network error ? http://ubuntuonair.com/
[22:18] <popey> i updated the dns for the site
[22:18] <popey> jono was on earlier
[22:18] <solarcloud_3srcn> oh OK
[22:18] <popey> will fix in a bit
[22:19] <solarcloud_3srcn> Is there anyway I can watch the meeting ??

[23:12] <popey> well done you!
[23:13] <mgdm> so someone is going to take a phone out of a box, and he's got YouTube to let him stream it?
[23:13] <mgdm> blimey
[23:14] <mgdm> and I concur with popey, I've often wondered why that guy is as well known as he appears to be
