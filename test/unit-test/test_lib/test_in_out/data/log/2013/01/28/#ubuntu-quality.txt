[19:40] <Noskcaj> balloons, is it possible to get testdrive to release before the 8th?
[19:41] <balloons> Noskcaj, you mean the netboot stuff/
[19:41] <balloons> ?
[19:41] <Noskcaj> and the Vbox 4.2 bug
[19:42] <balloons> I didn't look at the vbox bug
[19:42] <balloons> what is it?
[19:42] <balloons> ohh that it won't launch vbox 4.2
[19:42] <balloons> that's it right?
[19:43] <Noskcaj> yep, there are many other bugs (inc. it not being litian clean) but those two will mess with my classroom session
[19:45] <balloons> Noskcaj, as I think was conversed a bit ago on IRC, I'm not sure testdrive is seeing active development
[19:45] <balloons> that said, I don't think the changes your asking for would be difficult (but who knows!? sometimes simple stuff is hard)... but who will do them?
[19:46] <balloons> let's go look
[19:46] <balloons> https://launchpad.net/testdrive
[19:46] <Noskcaj> i know unit fixed the Vbox bug
[19:47] <Noskcaj> i did get a response from the guys who make it but unless something big appears, they can't be bothered

[19:52] <Noskcaj> bug 1079259
[19:52] <ubot5> bug 1079259 in testdrive (Ubuntu) "not lintian clean" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1079259
[19:53] <Noskcaj> balloons, please read
[19:54] <balloons> ohh.. yea, it's not up to snuff as a package
[19:54] <balloons> the debian stuff needs updating
[19:54] <balloons> and it needs a manpage.. they won't take it without fixes most likely
[20:04] <phillw> balloons: Noskcaj I have a proposed work around for non fuunctioning of the mini-iso, which actually does have some advantages that I had not considered..
[20:04] <Noskcaj> phillw, and they are?
[20:04] <Noskcaj> balloons, does the lintian mean it shouldn
[20:04] <Noskcaj> 't be realesed
[20:07] <phillw> Noskcaj: balloons I propose using ubuntu-server, with no additional things added. It has the advantage of having tasksel available to easily install the GUI (flavor) of their choice.
[20:08] <Noskcaj> phillw, sounds good. how big is it?
[20:08] <phillw> which is much more newcomer friendly way for them, rather than using CLI to add the flavor of thier choice.
[20:09] <Noskcaj> true
[20:09] <balloons> Noskcaj, the lintian stuff -- it depends on the archive guys
[20:09] <phillw> it is a base install, so all that is on it is required for a GUI
[20:09] <balloons> if an archive admin says it must meet that criteria, then it's not going in
[20:10] <Noskcaj> ok, and ok
[20:10] <phillw> balloons: do you think using server makes sense?
[20:12] <phillw> it has other advantages, that I did not immediately recognise, such as an easy way for some one to install LAMP for them to test / experiment with.
[20:13] <balloons> I think Noskcaj should make his life easy and plan for the changes to not be there..
[20:13] <balloons> I think picking a different iso is the best way to do that
[20:13] <balloons> and so yes, server is fine, if he wants to go that right
[20:13] <balloons> *route
[20:13] <phillw> ubuntu-server installs okay onto test-drive :)
[20:14] <Noskcaj> yep, my session is fine without the mini, no changes needed. just i hope no-one is using Vbox 4.2
[20:14] <phillw> for issues with VBox, I cannot help out. But I understand test-drive works okay with virt-manager (kvm).
[20:15] <phillw> Noskcaj: we can add a note to your session noting the bug. and advising people to use virt-manager.
[20:16] <balloons> if it comes up so be it
[20:16] <balloons> likely people willhave the old version
[20:16] <balloons> or you can explain to use an older version of kvm
[20:17] <phillw> balloons: I think that the current version of kvm does not have this problem?
[20:18] <Noskcaj> the bug only affects oracle Vbox.
[20:18] <Noskcaj> phillw, are you using it in your session?
[20:18] <phillw> balloons: and my fix for guestfish has been verified for quantal & should land in time :)
[20:19] <phillw> Noskcaj: I'm covering both VBox and virt-manager
[20:19] <balloons> nice
[20:20] <phillw> I think, given the circumstances, I'll use the VBox from the ubuntu repo.
[20:20] <Noskcaj> ok, that should help
[20:20] <phillw> Noskcaj: is test-drive oklay with that 'older' VBox?
[20:21] <Noskcaj> yep, it's only oracle that it dislikes
[20:21] <phillw> Noskcaj: older VBox & ubuntu-server it is, then :) I'll update my section.
[20:21] <Noskcaj> ok
[20:22] <Noskcaj> i have to eat now, bye
[20:23] <phillw> rc
[20:23] <phillw> tc
[20:23] <phillw> !
[20:25] <balloons> bye Noskcaj  ;-)
[21:01] <phillw> Noskcaj: for your info, I have VBox 4.1.8 on my system so I can check stuff with you if you need.
[21:01] <Noskcaj> phillw, that's the ubuntu repo's one?
[21:02] <phillw> Noskcaj: yup :)
[21:02] <Noskcaj> k, everything should work fine with it.
