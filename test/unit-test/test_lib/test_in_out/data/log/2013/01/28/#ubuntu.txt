[00:00] <Joe> Does that sound like a reasonable route to take?
[00:00] <C4zz1dy> ^Yes
[00:00] <aeon-ltd> yes
[00:01] <saltmiser> Joe, Xubuntu all the way. Avoid real ubuntu at all costs imo
[00:01] <saltmiser> avoid lubuntu in my opinion, as well.
[00:01] <saltmiser> as far as a complete desktop environment goes, it is not
[00:01] <Joe> Hmm so if I am to avoid Ubuntu, when I wish to install a VM on my Windows, which OS should I install?
[00:01] <saltmiser> well stay with Xubuntu
[00:02] <namesJay> Seriously am lookin to pass an hr before i hit the gym...which channel has lotta women above 30 ?lol
[00:02] <saltmiser> but if you want to learn Linux (and not Ubuntu) you'll have to start playing with the real toys, like Arch, FreeBSD and gentoo
[00:02] <Joe> So the VM is not necesarry?
[00:02] <k1l_> saltmiser: xubuntu is a big desktop. when winxp is slow its not a pleasure to use xfce at all
[00:02] <saltmiser> VM is not necessary
[00:02] <aeon-ltd> saltmiser: i wouldn't choose DEs for 'lightness', they pull in more dependencies than necessary
[00:02] <Joe> Okay I will just run Xubuntu on an old tower for now. It is likely I will be back! Thank you for all the assistance!

[00:21] <ClientAlive> I googled "dual boot windows 8 and ubuntu 12.04" and I'm seeing what looks like a lot of challenges with this. Is there any advice before I make a decision about this? Truth is: I would prefer an LTS version but I would also prefer ubuntu as UEFI boot. Am I correct in assuming 12.10 is UEFI but 12.04 is not? Any advice what my best option is?
=== grep is now known as Guest78091
[00:23] <craigbass1976> ClientAlive, I've had pretty good luck since dapper sticking withthe LTS versions.
[00:23] <ClientAlive> craigbass1976: thx for the input man
[00:23] <craigbass1976> ClientAlive, but I'd already quit dual booting by then, so I'm only half helpful I guess
[00:23] <icewhackr> Trying to get Ubuntu for Intel i73820 x64.  Download sez for AMD64.  Is this OK to use?  Or another Intel64 download  . . . ?
[00:23] <ClientAlive> I wonder if I can somehow have my cake and eat it too? (ie: uefi and lts in the same release of ubuntu)
[00:24] <escott> ClientAlive, disable secure boot. make sure you are booting your isntall media in efi mode.
[00:24] <aeon-ltd> icewhackr: that just means it's 64bit
[00:24] <k1l_> icewhackr: its called amd64 but its for intel and amd
[00:25] <escott> ClientAlive, and you shouldnt have any major issues with 12.04 and uefi provided you disable secure boot
[00:25] <escott> ClientAlive, if it picks the wrong bootloader you can just chroot in and install grub-efi
[00:25] <icewhackr> OK - Thnx - don't worry about the AMD name & just use on Intel as well.
[00:26] <craigbass1976> ClientAlive, down the road (after 14.2 maybe?  Anyone chime in) I don't think there will be the current LTS and "slightly less stable but still way better than Windows" scenario anymore.
[00:26] <ClientAlive> escott: cool. But now, about the time 12.04 came out I tried a uefi install on my desktop machine and it-was-a-horrrrorrrr-show. I ended up having to install in bios boot to get a working install. Have those issue been worked out? What can I expect when I try to do a uefi ubuntu install nowadays? Anything to watch out for?
[00:27] <escott> ClientAlive, why was it a horror show
[00:27] <craigbass1976> I followed these directions to fix someone's borked upgrade (they tried going to 12.04 to 12.10 yesterday) and I think it tok, but now 'm stuck at initramfs.  I have already been in the fs (just regular mounting from a livecd and chroot fom teh cd) and so I don't think it's a bad drive.  Also, there's no ntfs partition involved elsewhere on the drive.
[00:28] <ClientAlive> escott: It has been so long ago now that I don't recall the details (though I probalby have some scraps of paper around here with notes on them). All I rember is it was feeling very frustrated, not being able to get it to install correctly (or at all), spending a lot of time (as in a couple weeks) reaching out for help, and ultimately not being able to do it.
[00:29] <escott> ClientAlive, well efi is your only option if you want to dual boot
[00:29] <escott> so i would just go ahead and get started
[00:30] <escott> craigbass1976, "these directions" what directions?
[00:30] <craigbass1976> escott, oops.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1581099
[00:31] <ClientAlive> escott: (or anyone) - If I could have my DREAM UBUNTU - the cat's meaw - it would boot using boot stub where it just directly boots the kernel as an efi image. What do you think about that? Is it doable? How costly would that be (time, frustration level, etc)?
[00:31] <escott> craigbass1976, well if you are in the initramfs then grub is working
[00:32] <escott> ClientAlive, absolutely doable. i believe it requires a patched kernel. i dont believe those patches are in ubuntu kernel
[00:32] <escott> ClientAlive, and honestly i think it will never be a particularly popular way of booting the system. people like the menus, people like the shim support for secure boot, and im wary of putting the kernel on a fat partition
[00:33] <ClientAlive> escott: so what is the basic outline of doing something like that? (my guess? - fresh install of ubuntu desktop, then ?????)
[00:33] <escott> ClientAlive, you would be compiling your own kernel and directly placing it into the efi partition. i can't say more about how its done as I dont know much about it
[00:34] <ClientAlive> escott: I had not considered that notion before (putting the kernel on a fat partition). What, and defragging?
[00:34] <ClientAlive> escott: I see  :)
[00:34] <craigbass1976> escott, I figured.  But how to folks normally get past initramfs when it's not bad drive or ntfs related?  I'm about to go down this path: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1877789&page=2

[00:43] <Nerkshank> but no cdrom is installed

[00:45] <escott> Nerkshank, did you modify any files in /etc/apt prior to this

[00:50] <ubottu> InFlames: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[00:50] <InFlames> i don't need cinnamon support
[00:50] <InFlames> the issue was xorg
[00:50] <InFlames> i am simply stating the de was cinnamon, that issue is now fixed
[00:51] <InFlames> but to fix it i deleted my xorg.conf (i have a backup) and restarted x
[00:51] <LiThiuME3> Anyone here have experience with Symlink ?
[00:51] <InFlames> now xorg.conf never came back?
[00:51] <zygoptera> Mint's packages sound yummy
[00:51] <k1l_> InFlames: the xorg.conf is not needed
[00:51] <craigbass1976> escott, a way around  this whole thing would be if I could dump out some mysql databases somehow from a livecd.  Ever heard of anyone doing that?
[00:51] <InFlames> i assumed that
[00:51] <k1l_> InFlames: if no xorg.conf is there it uses autodetect
[00:51] <InFlames> my issue is really with setting up dual monitors
[00:51] <escott> craigbass1976, sure. just get the mysql client packages installed in the livecd
[00:52] <InFlames> right now it can see both, but they only work when mirrored
[00:52] <InFlames> if i try to separate them and hit apply, it errors
[00:52] <InFlames> i can show you a few of the errors if you like
[00:52] <craigbass1976> escott, and then choot?

[00:53] <zygoptera> InFlames >> the minute you mentioned mint, you lost most chance of getting your question answered here
[00:53] <escott> LiThiuME3, ?
[00:53] <Nerkshank> zygoptera, xubuntu
[00:54] <craigbass1976> escott, are you saying I could chroot to /mnt (if I mount the existing install there) and run mysql without doing anything else?
[00:54] <InFlames> zygoptera, i never mentioned mint, only cinnamon
[00:54] <escott> craigbass1976, if you have working binaries and the same machine architecture yes
[00:54] <zygoptera> InFlames >> same thing
[00:54] <InFlames> agree to disagree
[00:55] <InFlames> anyhow, the issue is really with multiple monitors
[00:55] <InFlames> it was just a weird occurance
[00:55] <InFlames> wondered what causes it
[00:55] <zygoptera> InFlames >> sauing cinnamon gave people the idea you were using mint
[00:55] <InFlames> i understand that
[00:55] <InFlames> and don't really see that as a problem
[00:56] <InFlames> i'm here for help, not a flame war
[00:56] <InFlames> i simply prefer cinnamon over unity
[00:56] <InFlames> although a combination of the two would be my favorite
[00:57] <InFlames> you don't happen to know a way i could use a launcher on the left like unity has outside of unity, do you?
[00:57] <zygoptera> InFlames >> then say you are using cinnamon in ubuntu a few times and maybe the other people heard will help you
[00:57] <k1l_> InFlames: when you are using cinnamon you should really ask the mint support, since most people here dont know what is going on and what issue is not produced by the cinnamon desktop

[00:57] <InFlames> my question wasn't related to cinnamon, i shouldn't have mentioned it
[00:58] <secleinteer> hi, is there an up-to-date ppa for eclipse? all i could find was one with v3.4
[00:58] <InFlames> my issue is with multiple monitors and detecting the resolutions
[00:58] <InFlames> i will even switch to unity if that helps solve it right now
[00:58] <k1l_> InFlames: when it comes to display multimonitor the desktop used is an important factor
[00:58] <InFlames> the gpu is a radeon hd 5450
[00:58] <k1l_> smth can work for unity and fail for cinnamon or other way around.
[00:59] <InFlames> well i can switch to unity and we can see if it's solvable there
[00:59] <InFlames> i am fine with whatever makes it easy
[00:59] <zygoptera> InFlames >> you are trying to detect the monitor's supported resilutions?
[00:59] <InFlames> yes
[00:59] <InFlames> i get some strange errors about min and max sizes when i try to apply settings
[00:59] <InFlames> via the settings window in ubuntu
[01:00] <zygoptera> InFlames >> maybe if you manually specify a resolution, and hope you are right?
[01:00] <InFlames> manually via xorg.conf?
[01:00] <zygoptera> yes
[01:01] <InFlames> that has been a nightmare
[01:01] <InFlames> i suppose i could put only the monitor's resolution setting in there and try?
[01:01] <InFlames> would that work?
[01:01] <InFlames> i mean would x accept that
[01:01] <zygoptera> usually
[01:02] <InFlames> i'll switch desktops, try that and come back

[01:39] <carlom61> I know but I got stuck with forums and guides and still when I install drivers from NVIDIA I get unity disappear

[01:47] <apos> kc5fwk_,  install totoem and make sure you have totem and flash browser plugin?
[01:48] <kc5fwk_> I am a noob with Linux, help please
[01:48] <apos> aeon-ltd,  it depends on what you use to clone it with
[01:48] <zygoptera> aeon-ltd >> if you use dd to clone it all, you will get the mbr
[01:48] <escott> aeon-ltd, that will bring over the mbr, but that may or may not be bootable
[01:48] <kc5fwk_> ok where can I get these programs, please?
[01:49] <bloodriver> hello! just a general command and question.  is it me or has the last two version of ubuntu seem a bit unstable?  i keep getting 'internal errors' and the odd freeze every couple of days.  some are easily identified and corrected but why?
[01:49] <john38> Anybody know a good program for converting mpg to wmv files
[01:49] <aeon-ltd> escott: more specific on the bootable part please?
[01:49] <zygoptera> aeon-ltd >> if you start at sector and go to the end, you will get the partition table and it should be bootable
[01:49] <aeon-ltd> zygoptera: ok
[01:50] <zygoptera> at sector 1
[01:50] <zygoptera> though dd calls sector 1 sector zero
[01:50] <efkt> john38: mencoder or one of it's frontends
[01:51] <apos> kc5fwk_,  go to your launcher menu and open the terminal -> type "sudo apt-get install adobe-flash && sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin && sudo apt-get install totem" (without the quotes)
[01:51] <aeon-ltd> zygoptera: will i need to do this from a live environment or is it safe to just boot into the existing install, log in as root and start dd-ing?
[01:51] <john38> efkt, how do you run it?
[01:51] <zygoptera> aeon-ltd >> you must use the live cd. linux can not be running when you copy it, or the copy will think it was not shut down properly
[01:52] <aeon-ltd> zygoptera: ok
[01:52] <kc5fwk_> thank you apos VERY much.  I truely appreciate the response.
[01:52] <apos> aeon-ltd,  check out http://redobackup.org/
[01:53] <aeon-ltd> apos: sounds like clonezilla
[01:53] <apos> kc5fwk_,  paste that long command into a terminal and you should be good to go
[01:53] <aeon-ltd> thanks for the replies people
[01:53] <efkt> john38: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MEncoder should get you started. Please consult the mencoder wiki for specifics. It's a very versatile program so it has a lot of options
[01:54] <john38> efkt, thanks

[01:54] <zygoptera> aeon-ltd >> Though I use scsi, which may or may not make a difference
[01:55] <kc5fwk_> apos I did as you suggested and it can't find adobe flash.  I thought I installed it.  I'll try to get it.  thank you
[01:55] <escott> aeon-ltd, just that it may or may not be bootable depending on where grub is looking and how the boot setup is configured
[01:55] <apos> then remove that part of the command. totem is the most important part
[01:55] <escott> aeon-ltd, if you are doing a cross-disk boot for instance...
[01:56] <aeon-ltd> escott: ahh ok ,then i assume i'll need to modify the boot line to the right /dev/sdx

[02:33] <k1l> ok, so can you give us some logs? like dmesg? maybe its a faulty hdd. or make sure your partitions are not running out of space
[02:33] <krywk> k1l, she said it's right after a fresh install, so I don't really think it's a space problem :T
[02:33] <cub> perhaps redownloading it, check the checksum of the file before burning it again, and then try reinstalling. If that doesn't work then you might need to get a hold of a DVD burner.

Now, you might be thinking 'his PC is not capable of running it in max', let me tell you I can run Crysis 2 ON LINUX through WineHQ at Maximum, with no lags whatsoever. Now, I've opened gnome-system-monitor and found out the game isn't even using half of the CPU power.
[02:34] <k1l> wonderlessgirl: like i told: logs could help to investigate the issue. out of the blue there could be several issues
[02:35] <wonderlessgirl> i dont know how to get logs ok
[02:35] <cub> Bottom line is wonderlessgirl , if the image used on the USB has faults, it could cause those issues.
[02:35] <satanxx> so.... i got a nvidia gtx660m... i cant find correct drivers any suggestion?
[02:35] <wonderlessgirl> well ive downloaded it 3 times and checked it every time, ive changed usb and everything
[02:35] <krywk> satanxx: Applications > System > System Config > Additional Drivers > NVIDIA (current-updates version)
[02:36] <wonderlessgirl> you guys are morons, andd you all do this, you decide its one thing i know its not and then you just keep hammering that one idea and tring nothing else
[02:36] <cub> lol wonderlessgirl , i've never expierenced your issues period
[02:36] <wonderlessgirl> both of yous are just saying its the usbs fault, i have no money or id use windows because this is shit, im not buying dvds,
[02:36] <cub> and i've installed multiple linux distros on different machines of different stats.
[02:36] <krywk> wonderlessgirl, you came here asking for help but your manners are not the ones indicating you're actually trying to be helpful for us to actually be able to help you.
[02:37] <krywk> Oh well
[02:37] <krywk> she's gone
[02:37] <krywk> :T
[02:37] <cub> i think they are a troll
[02:37] <krywk> Anyone got a solution to my problem? :I
[02:37] <lister> Maybe a bot
[02:37] <krywk> Didn't look like it
[02:37] <krywk> Maybe just a troll.
[02:38] <k1l> well, lets move on :)
=== ubuntu is now known as wonderlessgirl_
[02:38] <krywk> I really need help with this game :T
[02:38] <OerHeks> no, Bianca/wonderlessgirl was here yesterday, but we still don't know what the problem is, we do not get enough detals.
[02:39] <krywk> And yet again she's back?
[02:39] <krywk> Listen up wonderlessgirl_, if you think the people here can't help you, then go ask somewhere else.
[02:40] <k1l> !language > wonderlessgirl_
[02:40] <ubottu> wonderlessgirl_, please see my private message
[02:40] <wonderlessgirl_> kick me for language? all anyone ever says here is its probably your usb's fault or check your md5, omfg ive been having issues for 5 days now you think i havent heard it 50 billion times?
[02:40] <lister> A shop offers to my a NOTEBOOK MSI CR460 ubuntu preinstalled, but it is not certified, what can i wait for?
[02:40] <krywk> Then go ask for help somewhere else if you're not finding anything here.
[02:41] <krywk> Try the forums, there's more to support than an IRC chat.
[02:41] <wonderlessgirl_> no
[02:41] <wonderlessgirl_> im not waiting for a forum repsonse,
[02:41] <satanxx> krywk, its not letting me change drivers
[02:42] <k1l> wonderlessgirl_: you are ban evading. join #ubuntu-ops if you want to speak about that ban.
[02:42] <wonderlessgirl_> this is the 21st centrury,   the only thing slower than getitng support through a forum, is pen and paper
[02:42] <tripelb> I have QN old dell and a windows disk for xp that says for computers that already have windows so I reinstalled and it looks like it worked BUT... It left the Ubuntu partition and now the Ubuntu disk LiveCD cannot see any operating systems on the disk.  At first it just booted into windows. Now I get a choice. I also have some not partition that came with the dell, for recovery? I just want everything proper.
[02:42] <krywk> satanxx, do you have superuser permissions?
[02:42] <escott> thanks k1l
[02:42] <cub> that's so annoying...
[02:42] <satanxx> i do but DIDNT OPEN a su
[02:42] <satanxx> CAPS
[02:43] <apos>  usb is the most likely issue. if thts not it then you should log the startup and shutdown sequence to see if the computer is not properly shutting down. i dont own a hard drive, i use only usb. and i can tell you it sounds like a usb issue. try changing filesystems, perhapse
[02:43] <cub> i've never had that problem installing any linux distro
[02:43] <cub> and i've installed it on all kinds of machines
[02:43] <krywk> Then I don't see why it's not letting you change drivers.
[02:43] <cub> old and new
[02:43] <krywk> :T
[02:43] <gilb> I just installed Ubuntu and selected encryption with the installer- how do I set the password now?
[02:43] <krywk> Select the driver, click Install. Does it let you do that?
[02:44] <krywk> Or, well, 'Activate'.
[02:44] <lister> A shop offers to me a NOTEBOOK MSI CR460 ubuntu preinstalled, but it is not certified, what can i wait for?
[02:45] <krywk> I'll repeat my problem once again, and then, if I don't get an answer, I'll search somewhere else. :T

[02:45] <krywk> (And by IT i mean One Late Night)
[02:46] <krywk> Any suggestions?
[02:47] <k1l> krywk: the game isrunning in wine?
[02:47] <lister> A shop offers to me a NOTEBOOK MSI CR460 ubuntu preinstalled, but it is not certified, what can i wait for?
[02:47] <lister> please
[02:47] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, what do you mean by "what can I wait for"
[02:47] <krywk> k1l, no, the game was made in Unity 4.0, and I downloaded a native linux version.
[02:48] <texla> Ubuntu-12.04.1 additional drivers nvidia (current driver) which version is this driver ??
[02:48] <Seven_Six_Two> krywk, there's a linux version of Unity? I thought that was windows only
[02:48] <k1l> krywk: hmm. i dont know the game. i would try to ask the game community/devs, too
[02:49] <krywk> Seven_Six_Two, no, it's just the game that has a Linux version, Unity 4.0 implemented 'Export Linux binary' tool. The development kit in itself hasn't been ported.
[02:49] <lister> Seven_Six_Two: Well, Does wireless work?
[02:49] <krywk> k1l, I might try asking the devs, I just thought I could get some help here. :T
[02:49] <iIlL10Oo>  libmysqlclient-dev : Depends: libmysqlclient18 (= 5.5.22-0ubuntu1) but 5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 is to be installed
[02:49] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, I don't know, and that's not what I saw you asking. What's the chipset that it uses?
[02:49] <k1l> krywk: i dont know if there is a general ubuntu problem in that caase or if its a game-problem
[02:50] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, if it comes with ubuntu preinstalled, it's likely that the wireless works
[02:50] <lister> Seven_Six_Two: http://www.msi.com/product/nb/CR460.html#?div=Specification
[02:50] <krywk> k1l, Well, I didn't get this problem at all with other native Linux games. I might try it out with 'No Heroes' once it's out (Linux port, also Unity). If the problem is present there, then it might be Unity game issues.
[02:51] <cub> okay what graphics card works best with Unity??
[02:51] <krywk> I might as well try the windows version under WINE, since Unity games run wonderfully under WINE.
[02:51] <cub> im using an intel integrated chip and have 1gb of ram, and it's a little slow
[02:51] <lister> Seven_Six_Two: I cannot prove the notebook before to pay for it!
[02:51] <iIlL10Oo>  libmysqlclient-dev : Depends: libmysqlclient18 (= 5.5.22-0ubuntu1) but 5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 is  installed
[02:52] <escott> cub, intel is very well supported but the fact that you only have 1gb of ram suggests your system is just underpowered in general
[02:52] <genoobie> hey all
[02:52] <genoobie> just finished installing "lubuntu"
[02:52] <cub> escott, i can upgrade to 4gb (the max supported) but will this actually help the speed at which unity runs?
[02:52] <genoobie> but the login screen is all screwed up
[02:52] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, so the shop will sell it to you, but won't let you return it if it's not working? Tell the shop to stuff it.
[02:53] <genoobie> the first page "lubuntu" logo is OK
[02:53] <cub> like for example.... the Window preview is slower on this machine than it was on my desktop using the LiveCd
[02:53] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, buy from somewhere else.
[02:53] <escott> cub, im guessing no. if they sold a system with only 1gb of ram then it was either very old or a netbook which is never going to be blazingly fast
[02:53] <genoobie> but where you get the login screen is all blocked / illegible
[02:53] <lister> There is cheapest
[02:53] <genoobie> must be an "X" problem
[02:53] <genoobie> suggestions on how to fix?
[02:53] <k1l> genoobie: install the videocard driver? what card is it? which driver using so far?
[02:54] <cub> well my machine is old, like i said i can upgrade the ram from 1gb to 4gb, but that is the max supported
[02:54] <cub> i cannot install more than 4gb on this pos
[02:54] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, so what? You send me $100 and I'll send you a computer.
[02:54] <genoobie> kll no way to know just yet
[02:54] <genoobie> I just logged in from memory
[02:54] <genoobie> not sure how to get a terminal screen when the video is all effed
[02:54] <genoobie> any suggestions?
[02:54] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, you get what you pay for, and a shop that won't take back something that doesn't work, doesn't deserve your money. Spend a little bit more and get something that's not chaff.
[02:55] <k1l> genoobie: with crtl+alt+f1 you can switch to a terminal and with crtl+alt+f7 you can switch back
[02:55] <genoobie> okay cool!
[02:55] <genoobie> it's giving errors on the tty
[02:55] <lister> Seven_Six_Two: Well, where do you live?
[02:55] <genoobie> urgh
[02:55] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, and don't think I don't know what it means to not be able to afford it. There's a reason that I'm using a 6 year old pc right now.
[02:56] <genoobie> Buffer I/O error device fd0, sector 0
[02:56] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, Canada, so it's not like I can say there aren't lots of shops.
[02:56] <lister> Seven_Six_Two: so do I
[02:56] <genoobie> Buffer I/O error on device fd0, logical block 0
[02:56] <lister>  I'm using a 6 year old pc right now.
[02:57] <genoobie> end_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0
[02:57] <genoobie> bad hdd?
[02:57] <Seven_Six_Two> I would suggest buying from a reputable online retailer if there aren't any other shops that you can go to.
[02:57] <krywk> Is this the full error, genoobie? Buffer I/O error on device fd0, logical block 0
[02:57] <krywk> Oh, yes it is.
[02:58] <genoobie> yes
[02:58] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, sorry...I'll have to end this line, as this is an Ubuntu support channel.
[02:58] <genoobie> krywk, bad hdd?
[02:58] <krywk> genoobie, I still don't know, I'm searching about it
[02:58] <Seven_Six_Two> lister, I'm in #ubuntu-offtopic as well
[02:58] <genoobie> hrm, let me restart
[02:59] <krywk> Looks like the system is trying to mount a floppy disk.
[02:59] <krywk> :I
[02:59] <Seven_Six_Two> krywk, edit your fstab and comment out the floppy entry
[02:59] <krywk> No, I mean, genoobie's problem
[02:59] <krywk> lol
[02:59] <InFlames> anyone know if SubSection is a valid section name in xorg.conf?
[02:59] <genoobie> urgh, okay
[02:59] <texla> Ubuntu-12.04.1 additional drivers nvidia (current driver) which version is this driver ??
[02:59] <iIlL10Oo>  libmysqlclient-dev : Depends: libmysqlclient18 (= 5.5.22-0ubuntu1) but 5.5.29-0ubuntu0.12.04.1 is  installed
[03:00] <escott> genoobie, fd0 would usually be floppy disk 0
[03:00] <Seven_Six_Two> InFlames, I can't say for sure, but in all my time, I've never seen it.
[03:00] <genoobie> okay, cool
[03:00] <lister> Seven_Six_Two: Ok, no problem, thanks a lot.
[03:00] <genoobie> so I am back at the grub
[03:00] <InFlames> Seven_Six_Two, it was for setting the VirtualScreen size
[03:00] <genoobie> should I try to boot to a "recovery" kernel?
[03:00] <krywk> texla, should be 3.04
[03:00] <genoobie> or recovery mode?
[03:00] <InFlames> SubSection "Display"
[03:00] <InFlames>                 Virtual 4480 2680
[03:00] <InFlames>         EndSubSection
[03:00] <InFlames> like that
[03:00] <FloodBot1> InFlames: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[03:01] <InFlames> oops
[03:01] <genoobie> or should I do a command line to get an X-enviro?
[03:01] <xbmc> exit
[03:01] <xbmc> quit
[03:02] <genoobie> hrm
[03:02] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, I'm sorry to ask, but what is your problem? I'd like to help!
[03:02] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, awesome!
[03:02] <genoobie> okay, so I just installed lubuntu
[03:02] <genoobie> the splash screen comes up fine\
[03:03] <genoobie> but then the login screen is completely borked
[03:03] <genoobie> probably a bad X11 setting
[03:03] <genoobie> plus it's trying to mount a floppy
[03:03] <kc5fwk_> does anyone know how to get Ubuntu to mail a copy on disc?  I'm not seeing a link on the website.  I'm probably looking right at it though ..... lol
[03:03] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, ok, can you alt+ctrl_F1 for a terminal?
[03:03] <bashinate> I have a question, when logging into splash screen it immediately takes me back,  mysql is failing to start i see
[03:03] <bashinate> restarting xorg has not helped
[03:03] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, don't worry about the floppy. I'll show you the fix.
[03:04] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, yes, but I am back at grub thinking there is a command line option that might help with "X" and fd0
[03:04] <genoobie> should I just boot to ubuntu?
[03:04] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, no, boot normally, and ctrl+alt+f1 and then log in.
[03:04] <Dmnchild> Is there a better way to edit user accounts than the system settings? it seems I created a user, but possibly allocated a small amount of /home space to this user when i want them to have no limitations.
[03:04] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, tell me when you're ready.
[03:05] <genoobie> okay
[03:05] <genoobie> booting
[03:05] <Seven_Six_Two> Dmnchild, you both share the /home space
[03:05] <genoobie> there seems to be some kind of batch thing in the beginning that is looking for a floppy
[03:05] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, don't worry about it.
[03:05] <Dmnchild> Hm, mebbe its a setting elsewhere for the program limiting that user account.
[03:06] <gilb> I just installed Ubuntu and selected encryption with the installer- how do I set the password now?
[03:06] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, I am logged in
[03:06] <Dmnchild>  /home has 2tb
[03:06] <genoobie> it stopped trying to mount the floppy
[03:06] <escott> gilb, its the user password
[03:06] <genoobie> but login screen is borked
[03:06] <gilb> escott, thank you
[03:06] <escott> genoobie, some motherboards send weird stuff wrt to floppys you can blacklist the module
[03:06] <gilb> is there any way to verify that my disk is in fact encrypted?
[03:07] <escott> gilb, encrypted home is different from encrypted disk
[03:07] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, ok, at the terminal, type (without quotes) "sudo apt-get install gdm". it will prompt for your password, and then ask you to choose a display manager. choose gdm and tell me what the other choices are.
[03:07] <genoobie> escott, that's a bit out of my league at the moment
[03:07] <escott> gilb, but your ciphertext is stored in ~/.Private
=== Motoservo_ is now known as Motoservo
[03:08] <bashinate> would mysql not starting have anything to do with being re-directed to splash screen at login ?
[03:08] <genoobie> do I want to continue?
[03:08] <genoobie> no choices listed
[03:08] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, yes
[03:08] <gilb> escott, thank you again
[03:08] <krywk> Huh?
[03:08] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, what's the basic idea here
[03:09] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, that's just asking because apt selected other packages to install as well. They're probably dependencies.
[03:09] <genoobie> yes
[03:09] <krywk> It looks like 'One Late Night' requires an i5 to run at Beautiful-Fantastic
[03:09] <krywk> I have an i3
[03:09] <krywk> :T
[03:09] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, changing the default display manager. That's what gives the login screen.
=== omfg is now known as omfgwhy
[03:09] <genoobie> gdm is an option and lightdm is an option
[03:09] <omfgwhy> ive got a strange ubuntu issue
[03:09] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, since yours looks corrupted, changing to another one is a good first step.
[03:09] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, choose gdm
[03:09] <genoobie> okay
[03:09] <omfgwhy> it appears that apt has a hardcoded ip address for us.archive.ubuntu.com
[03:10] <krywk> Actually no
[03:10] <krywk> no.
[03:10] <krywk> Lightdm is better.
[03:10] <krywk> GDM usually gives problems with newly created users.
[03:10] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, does the display manager only handle the intro screen?
[03:10] <genoobie> ugh
[03:10] <krywk> You can change it later though
[03:10] <krywk> So if you're experiencing these kind of problems, don't worry
[03:10] <Seven_Six_Two> krywk, oh? and can you fix a corruption from the terminal? You've been here long enough to suggest something genius.
[03:11] <genoobie> so the dm became corrupted (or at least that's the premise)?
[03:11] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, yes, and you can change it at will.
[03:11] <genoobie> okay
[03:11] <genoobie> back at $
[03:11] <genoobie> restart?
[03:11] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, no. "sudo service gdm restart"
[03:11] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, and see if you get to a good login screen
[03:11] <krywk> Seven_Six_Two, actually you CAN change from GDM to LightDM from terminal
[03:11] <krywk> Not sure how though, but you can.
[03:11] <genoobie> nah
[03:12] <genoobie> equally borked
[03:12] <genoobie> :)
[03:12] <genoobie> ugh
[03:12] <Seven_Six_Two> krywk, I know. that's what we just did.
[03:12] <genoobie> uh oh
[03:12] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, can you define "borked" without saying "broken"?
[03:12] <genoobie> so is ctrl-alt-f1
[03:12] <krywk> Wait, so he's been using LightDM the whole time?
[03:12] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, what do you see?
[03:12] <genoobie> hold a sec
[03:13] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, can you do ctrl+alt+F2?
[03:13] <genoobie> how do I switch out of terminal screen again?
[03:13] <krywk> I'm gonna try and run this game on Good
[03:13] <Seven_Six_Two> the gui is ctrl+alt+F7
[03:13] <genoobie> yeah but now the tty screen looks funny
[03:13] <genoobie> okay
[03:13] <qiyong> is lxr dropped?
[03:13] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, terminals are from F1...F6
[03:13] <qiyong> how to find dropped pkgs?
[03:13] <genoobie> if I go to ctrl+alt+F7
[03:13] <genoobie> there are four stripes
[03:13] <genoobie> blue field
[03:14] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, ok, what kind of video do you have?
[03:14] <genoobie> whitish blockiness on them
[03:14] <genoobie> s3 savage I think
[03:14] <genoobie> whopping 8mb sgram
[03:14] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, thinkpad?
[03:15] <genoobie> yep
[03:15] <genoobie> older t21
[03:15] <genoobie> now you are going to tell me it's not supported :)
[03:15] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, can you get to a terminal again?
[03:16] <uplinx> Anyone know about running 2x dual head cards for a total of 4 monitors?
[03:16] <genoobie> yes
[03:16] <genoobie> but its all weird now
[03:16] <krywk> Well it's not my PC's issue since it runs slowly even on Fastest.
[03:16] <genoobie> back at terminal
[03:16] <genoobie> now what
[03:16] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, please prepend with my nickname. It makes it easier to see messages that are for me. Most clients will autocomplete a nickname if you hit tab after a few letters.
[03:16] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, you got it
[03:16] <qiyong> how to find dropped pkgs?
[03:17] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-s3"
[03:17] <pingupingu> hello guys
[03:17] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, sorry...put "savage" instead of "s3"
[03:17] <krywk> Now that I remember, Thinkpad computers DO have problems with Ubuntu. Not sure why though
[03:17] <pingupingu> whats is the preferred backup solution?
[03:18] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, I am rebooting because I could not read the tty
[03:18] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, ok.
[03:18] <krywk> I might be talking out of my butt though, so I'm not sure
[03:18] <genoobie> krywk, if you are you could put that on youtube and make money...
[03:19] <krywk> Yep, definitely talking out of my butt.
[03:19] <genoobie> okay, urgh
[03:19] <krywk> Anyways
[03:19] <krywk> I have... ANOTHER problem.

[03:20] <tripelb> I have QN old dell and a windows disk for xp that says for computers that already have windows so I reinstalled and it looks like it worked BUT... It left the Ubuntu partition and now the Ubuntu disk LiveCD cannot see any operating systems on the disk.  At first it just booted into windows. Now I get a choice. I also have some not partition that came with the dell, for recovery? I just want everything proper.  Please help.
[03:21] <krywk> escott, I mean, in normal ubuntu use, not for installing or anything like that, just to transfer files from one PC to another
[03:21] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, can you paste the output of "lspci -v" to pastebin.com and paste a link to it here please?
[03:21] <genoobie> http://askubuntu.com/questions/184089/lubuntu-12-04-on-an-ibm-thinkpad-t21
[03:21] <genoobie> what does this mean...
[03:22] <escott> krywk, still the same can be said... its cheap lower power, fragile form factor
[03:22] <escott> krywk, make sure you aren't pulling it before it completely umounts
[03:22] <genoobie> um, not really sure how to do this without a graphical interface

[03:22] <krywk> escott, it's a Kingstom DT-102, 4 GB
[03:22] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two,  um, not really sure how to do this without a graphical interface
[03:22] <krywk> I don't think it's a low-end pendrive at all
[03:23] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, how to downgrade your mesalib? I wouldn't try it...
[03:23] <krywk> escott, also, I make sure to remove it in safe mode before pulling it out
[03:23] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, so I have to go back to an older version of lubuntu
[03:23] <genoobie> that's fine
[03:24] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, that's what I get from reading that bit of help
[03:24] <escott> krywk, im not saying it has anything to do with low-end or high-end
[03:24] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, if you've got a few minutes, I'll take a quick break and have a think. An older version would be the easiest
[03:24] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, you're standing at the edge of a rabbit hole.
[03:24] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, that's what that seems to imply though correct...although that person is obviously able to make it work
[03:24] <genoobie> just poor video performance.
[03:25] <genoobie> I suppose I could just run XP
[03:25] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, although to be honest, this kind of issue is how I learned about linux.
[03:25] <escott> krywk, im saying its a market where the price point is for a disposable product... so they aren't making industrial strength flash drives. if it gets your pictures from one computer to the next call it a victory. if it doesn't reformat and try again
[03:25] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, yeah, it'
[03:25] <genoobie> I was able to run xubuntu and it loaded up OK
[03:26] <genoobie> let me try lubuntu 11
[03:26] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, it's looks like it's possible, but probably not if you have to get personal help on irc.
[03:26] <genoobie> :)
[03:26] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, sorry. not that it's impossible, but for me to guide you through it would be a lot more difficult than downloading an older version and sticking with that.
[03:26] <krywk> :I
[03:26] <genoobie> I think 11 has the 3.x kernel though
[03:26] <krywk> Also I just made a port for Pesadelo for Linux
[03:27] <krywk> Just copied over a few files from One Late Night
[03:27] <krywk> :T
[03:27] <genoobie> xubuntu was fine, just super slow
[03:27] <genoobie> maybe I should try to slim down xubuntu
[03:27] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, that's related to the 3d driver (hardware acceleration) but the mesalib is for software acceleration.
[03:27] <genoobie> somehow that version 12.10 worked...now I am perplexed
[03:28] <genoobie> but xubuntu - lubuntu should've installed the same.
[03:28] <genoobie> granted I went with an alternate install on the lubuntu
[03:28] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, 12.10 worked for you?
[03:28] <genoobie> and xubuntu I used the graphical install
[03:28] <genoobie> yes
[03:28] <lister> I'm going to the bed...
[03:28] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, then go back to that!
[03:28] <genoobie> nite lister
[03:29] <genoobie> yes, but the problem was xubuntu was prohibitively slow
[03:29] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, you can strip it down once it's working
[03:29] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, are you going to be around a while?
[03:29] <genoobie> not really sure how to "strip it down"
[03:29] <genoobie> :)
[03:29] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, oh yes. I'm up late tonight. I have to finish reading Tigana.
[03:29] <lister> bye
[03:30] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, stopping stuff that is running that you don't need
[03:30] <genoobie> okay I will be back after I install xubuntu, again, for the umpteenth time :)
[03:30] <krywk> I wonder if I can do the same for other Unity games
[03:30] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, have you considered DSL or Puppy?
[03:30] <genoobie> puppy was ok
[03:31] <genoobie> pkgman in puppy was a bit rough
[03:31] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, I can imagine!
[03:31] <genoobie> iirc the sound didn't work either
[03:31] <genoobie> only went up to the 2.x kernels
[03:32] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, I have a legal copy of 98SE if you're interested.
[03:32] <genoobie> haha
[03:32] <genoobie> I can't even remember how to use that OS
[03:33] <genoobie> I wonder if chrome would even work on that...
[03:33] <genoobie> to be honest, xp works OK, just not great
[03:33] <genoobie> thought I could get better performance with *nix
[03:33] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, you can, but part of it depends on you...
[03:34] <genoobie> heh...puppy has a new distro...
[03:34] <Seven_Six_Two> biab
[03:34] <genoobie> maybe I'll try puppy
[03:35] <genoobie> what's the difference between slackware compatible and precise-pangolin compatible...
[03:35] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, slackware is a totally different beast
[03:36] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, it doesn't use apt
[03:36] <genoobie> okay I will skip it for now
[03:36] <genoobie> ugh
[03:36] <genoobie> yeah, I don't want to mess with figuring out dependencies, etc.
[03:36] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, I wasn't making a qualitative observation though. Slackware is very good, and known to be very stable.
[03:36] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, any suggestion on which puppy distro might be best?

[03:37] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, debian is also another good choice. very stable, uses apt.
[03:37] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, so what was wrong with xubuntu?
[03:37] <genoobie> I mean it is slow
[03:37] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, nothing. But there are lots of choices, and each has its advantages.
[03:38] <genoobie> hrm, puppy was the fastest one I have used to date
[03:39] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, it's designed for very lightweight machines. but xangua is right, and we should go to offtopic to discuss further
[03:39] <genoobie> Seven_Six_Two, I don't want to take all your time
[03:40] <Seven_Six_Two> genoobie, don't worry. I'll let you know when I'm too busy. There's a reason I run multi-head
[03:40] <genoobie> okay, so I have two options,
[03:40] <genoobie> puppylinux or try to slim down xubuntu
[03:41] <genoobie> I don't know that the latest release of puppy works either

[03:46] <Thorbinator> Hi, how do I run multiple instances of VMware?
[03:47] <Thorbinator> this is using VMware player, trying to guest win7 and server 2008 on ubuntu 12.10 host
[03:48] <Seven_Six_Two> Thorbinator, you want to start multiple virtual machines, or instances of vmware? They aren't the same
[03:48] <Thorbinator> preferably multiple VMs
[03:49] <Seven_Six_Two> Thorbinator, to be honest, I've never tried, but I would assume that you just start another one from the control panel in the manner that you started the first one.

[03:50] <douloi> floppyears: from the left sidebar of what?
[03:51] <floppyears> douloi: the default launcher icons in the left hand side of the ubuntu desktop.
[03:51] <cgkades> floppyears: right click, lock to launcher?
[03:51] <Nick> Hello!!
[03:51] <cfhowlett> Nick, greetings
[03:51] <l0lh4rd> hi
=== Nick is now known as Guest78490
[03:51] <cub> so no one had any video card suggestions
[03:51] <cub> lol
[03:51] <l0lh4rd> nope
[03:51] <floppyears> douloi: cgkades thanks. I guess I was doing the right click wrong. This is a macbook and I expected the right click to be ctrl+click instead
[03:51] <IveBeenBit> I'm new to Ubuntu and the OSS world. Can anyone explain to me how Canonical makes money?
[03:51] <Guest78490> I'm having some trouble with a bluetooth dongle on Ubuntu 12.04. Can anyone here lend me a hand?
[03:52] <cfhowlett> IveBeenBit, please take this discussion over to #ubuntu-offtopic.  Thanks
[03:52] <Seven_Six_Two> uplinx, I think you'd need special configuration. I'd like to know too, as I'm running dual and would like to go to 3 or 4 without buying matrox gear.
[03:52] <cgkades> floppyears: how does it run on your mac? did you dual-boot?
[03:52] <Marcin_> IveBeenBit: if you are new in ubuntu and oss world learn them not ask question how to make money :)
[03:53] <uplinx> Seven_Six_Two: thanks for the information, i'll keep working on my google fu on this one
[03:53] <uplinx> Seven_Six_Two: I'm looking to run with 4 heads.
[03:53] <floppyears> cgkades: I wiped the hard drive and installed ubuntu 12.10 using the installer dvd. This is an old mackboo pro. It's not super fast, but it doesn't lag too bad.
[03:53] <Guest78490> Can you make Ubuntu recognize a bluetooth dongle booting from CD?
[03:53] <l0lh4rd> any good ebooks for learning linux
[03:53] <IveBeenBit> cfhowlett, Sorry...I will go to that channel and ask.
[03:53] <cfhowlett> IveBeenBit, no worries and welcome to ubuntu.
[03:54] <cgkades> floppyears: ah ok, cool. i have an old mac book. not sure if i want to install ubuntu, or keep it running os x and make it an itunes server
[03:54] <IveBeenBit> l0lh4rd, I found The Ubuntu Beginner's Guide to be pretty good by Jonathan Moeller. It's like 5 bucks on Amazon. I'm new myself.
[03:54] <floppyears> cgkades: yeah, I might do that with an old mac mini that I have around. Is it pretty hard to setup an itunes server?
[03:55] <l0lh4rd> thanks
=== Guest78490 is now known as Kaedalus
[03:55] <cgkades> floppyears: by itunes server, i just mean, leave itunes running, and access all my ripped dvd's from my apple tv
[03:55] <floppyears> ah
[03:55] <cfhowlett> l0lh4rd, there is the free Ubuntu Pocket Guide version 1.1
[03:56] <floppyears> where can I find the setting to turn off the eye candy in ubuntu and make it run as fast as possible?
[03:56] <douloi> thanks for the book tip, I just bought it
[03:56] <bravis> So Ubuntu does not have glib by default?
[03:56] <floppyears> I know I can switch to a different wm and have it run fast, but want to try ubuntu de first.

[03:56] <DreadNaught> Am I allowed to freely ask a question in here? I'm new
[03:57] <mikodo> Apparmor from app called Armorforge. Should Firefox be set for enforce-mode. I have no router, just connect to a modem for one computer?
[03:57] <l0lh4rd> new here as well
[03:58] <bravis> so does anyone here use IRSSI?
[03:58] <cfhowlett> floppyears, light DE would be lxde or xfce
[03:58] <cgkades> bravis: sometimes. i use weechat mostly though
[03:58] <cfhowlett> DreadNaught, please ask you support questions
[03:58] <WACOMalt> Hi, I opened a file in nano, not realising I needed sudo to save it. When I try to save it naturally says permission denied. is there any way to get into sudo now so I dont lose my changes? or do I have to save elsewhere and then move/chown the file back to the original location?
[03:58] <DreadNaught> I need some advice on using Ubuntu in an internet cafe?
[03:59] <cfhowlett> WACOMalt, sudo on the fly ... no.
[03:59] <bravis> copy past after sudo @WAC
[03:59] <cfhowlett> DreadNaught, ask
[04:00] <Kaedalus> Excuse me, may I ask for support too?
[04:00] <cfhowlett> Kaedalus, please ask
[04:00] <cfhowlett> !details
[04:00] <ubottu> Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[04:00] <bravis> mm weechat will look into it i got use to irssi and need glib to compile it but glib is not part of ubuntu
[04:01] <Kaedalus> So, I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 from CD.  I'm trying to use a USB Bluetooth Dongle. It is recognized as a USB device, but not as a bluetooth adapter.
[04:01] <cgkades> bravis: why dont you apt-get install irssi?
[04:01] <Kaedalus> It uses BlueSoleil on Windows.
[04:01] <Kaedalus> What can I do to make it work?
[04:01] <Seven_Six_Two> Kaedalus, have you installed the bluez packages?
[04:02] <Kaedalus> Yes. Also two more bluetooth packages (Blueman and Bluewho)
[04:02] <Kaedalus> I tried resetting the bluetooth services through the terminal, to no effect.
[04:02] <bravis> hmmm cause that would make sense...
[04:03] <cfhowlett> Kaedalus, running from CD?  perhaps if you actually install ubuntu ...
[04:03] <cgkades> bravis: lol
[04:03] <Bon-chan> guys, may i ask for some link to online privacy with ubuntu articles?
[04:03] <bravis> lol i am tired dont know why i was trying to compile it
[04:03] <Kaedalus> That's my problem. I only wanted to do a quick use of a program which is Ubuntu only
[04:03] <cfhowlett> Bon-chan, please take this query to #ubuntu-offtopic as this is the support channel.  Thanks.
[04:03] <mikodo> Xubuntu 12.04 No router, just modem connect to one computer.  Apparmor from app called Armorforge. Should Firefox be set for enforce mode or complain mode? Anyone know?
[04:04] <Kaedalus> Using it only once, because the Ubuntu PC is not home.
[04:04] <Bon-chan> cfhowlett, sorry and thanks!
[04:04] <cfhowlett> Kaedalus, OK quick fix; install virtualbox, install ubuntu there and run it.
[04:04] <Kaedalus> Ok, will do that.
[04:04] <Kaedalus> I though it wouldn't work with bluetooth.
[04:04] <cfhowlett> Kaedalus, good luck
[04:04] <Kaedalus> Thanks for the help!!
[04:05] <cgkades> bravis: setting up the dependent libraries sucks. thats why i love package management
[04:05] <bravis> maybe a cigar will help the thought process...
[04:05] <bravis> its installed
[04:05] <cgkades> bravis: or a beer :)
[04:05] <bravis> that is what my mindset is
[04:06]  * cfhowlett ubuntu prefers homebrewed pale ale ...
[04:06] <bravis> used to do way too much compiling
[04:06] <bravis> kinda nice to have pkg managers
[04:06] <cgkades> bravis: you should look into weechat. it's pretty sweet. you can split up the terminal to multple windows
[04:06] <bravis>  bbiab smokin..
[04:06] <bravis> @cgkades i will
[04:07] <mikodo> Well, Armorforge I will leave Firefox and Thunderbird on enforce mode until told differently. Thanks! Bye

[04:20] <Pici> WACOMalt: you don't need */24.  Just 0 * * * * /do/whatever
[04:21] <xrs> C-S-B, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo
[04:21] <Flannel> lolcat: uh, depends on your options.  You can see man shred about all the goodies, but it will write various patterns, and then optionally all zeros.
[04:21] <bravis> ok noob q of the moment where do installed apps go? did apt-get install on a prog and cant find it in the apps...
[04:21] <Pici> WACOMalt: Thing of the crontab as filter that you'd put against a clock. whenever it matches, it runs.
[04:21] <C-S-B> xrs, I was hoping to do it using UFW commands rather iptables directly.
[04:22] <lolcat> Flannel: Oh, I thougth it was some sort of speed-deletion.
[04:22] <bashinate> so when I login at splash screen I am automatically re-directed to splash screen
[04:22] <Flannel> lolcat: Nope, it takes a while.
[04:22] <cfhowlett> bravis, try in terminal; locate program
[04:22] <bashinate> anyone seen this ?
[04:22] <xrs> chains and tables is how i was trained sorry
[04:22] <Ray> all see that
[04:22] <lolcat> Flannel: 500GB through USB will be slow, rigth?
[04:22] <Flannel> lolcat: I mean, you can ask it to do fewer passes, which will speed things up.
[04:22] <C-S-B> xrs, the tunnel endpoint, my server, is firewalled ok.
[04:23] <WACOMalt> so */24 means....
[04:23] <C-S-B> but It is advertising another subnet /64 to my clients
[04:23] <bravis> oh figured there was a new shortcut
[04:23] <Flannel> lolcat: yeah.  Probably leave that running overnight.  Apparently the default is 3 passes of patterns.
[04:23] <WACOMalt> every hour ... if the hour is a 24?
[04:23] <Pici> WACOMalt: */24 doesn't really make sense for a field that would normally match agains't any hour.
[04:24] <lolcat> Flannel: Ooh, it was fairly quick on my 80gb drive, but I guess it has to be done, I am encrypting the drive
[04:24] <Flannel> lolcat: If you're encrypting, aren't you going to populate it with random data anyway?
[04:24] <xrs> bravis, "/sbin", "/usr" in a few places and "/home/$you"
[04:25] <bashinate> why would splash screen re-direct upon login ? i've tried re-installing lightdm, deleted my home profile, created a new user, and still nada
[04:25] <lolcat> Flannel: yes, but I want to be sure the original content is truley gone
[04:26] <Pici> WACOMalt: even then */24 would mean every 24 hours. Which isn't what you want.
[04:27] <bashinate> also tried recovery cd and starting fail safe graphical environment
[04:28] <Ray> redirect..? where to..?
[04:29] <bashinate> back to splash screen

[04:37] <NegressCounty> I am addressing gry's answer about Laman.  The River Laman isn't in historical records because Lehi named it after his oldest son while passing it when he took his family out into the wilderness by the red sea before taking the voyage to the Americas
[04:37] <NegressCounty> The fact that the Laman River isn't on any map isn't proof that the Book of Mormon was supposedly a fabrication.

[04:38] <bashinate> Ray: still same :(
[04:38] <NegressCounty> you see the record of this was found on buried tablets
[04:38] <cfhowlett> NegressCounty, this is not the channel you're looking for..

[04:38] <chamunks> I need to allow scp to acces sudo without a password
[04:38] <NegressCounty> If you read Nephi I well you can see the context
[04:38] <NegressCounty> gry  are you there?
[04:38] <cfhowlett> NegressCounty, stop please.
[04:39] <Ray> bashinate : going think another solution now
[04:39] <cfhowlett> NegressCounty, wrong channel ...
[04:39] <bashinate> cool, thx
[04:39] <Ray> #ubuntu
[04:39] <NegressCounty> anyhow.. anybody else who has any questions about such scripture can email me
[04:39] <Ray> sure
[04:39] <NegressCounty> or I can refer you to another bishop
[04:39] <Ray> but its #ubuntu
[04:39] <chamunks> I cant get around needing to use winscp or filezilla for some of the developers I need someone who knows how to disable password logins in a secure way via just scp
[04:39] <cfhowlett> NegressCounty, again, you are in the WRONG CHANNEL
[04:39] <NegressCounty> but everything in the Book of Mormon can be proven
[04:39] <NegressCounty> be sure of that gry
[04:40] <Ray> bashinate : did it..?
[04:40] <NegressCounty> what was that for?

[04:45] <Pici> WACOMalt: sure, except there is no 24th hour. its 0-23
[04:45] <Ray> bashinate : some solution just take out the probs on some computers :/ it's a Bug
[04:45] <WACOMalt> Pici, ah derp :D so 0 would be midnight
[04:45] <Pici> WACOMalt: yep
[04:45] <Ray> bashinate : Dont know exactly what number the bug is.
[04:46] <chamunks> Does anyone have any idea how that I could do this?  Seems they want me to add sudo -s into the scp/shell info on winscp but it wont connecct to the ubuntu host
[04:46] <Pici> WACOMalt: everything else looks fine.  I'd just check `man 5 crontab` to see which day of the week is 0, I can't recall off the top of my head.
[04:46] <bashinate> ray: thats what I was afraid of
[04:46] <bashinate> yeah i had tried creating another user and guest already
[04:46] <bashinate> and nada
[04:47] <WACOMalt> 0 is sunday
[04:47] <bashinate> gonna check the logs
[04:47] <Ray> bashinate : many users finally re-install the ubuntu
[04:47] <bashinate> of course this is my media server, and finally have everything configured how i want :(
[04:48] <Ray> its easy, but need a cup of coffee and wafers to do that~
[04:53] <Ray> bashinate : yep its hurt to reinstall, why you dont try to install another DE like Gnome3..???
[04:54] <Ray> bashinate : so when you login, choose gnome3 instead of ubuntu & ubuntu 2d
[04:54] <bashinate> i've tried all of them
[04:54] <bashinate> none work
[04:54] <WACOMalt> (warning, opinion coming) install Cinnamon Ui and be happy.
[04:55] <bashinate> haha, i've actually been wanting to try it
[04:55] <Ray> you've just have been trolled by a bug, probably~
[04:56] <Ray> why you dont?
[04:56] <chamunks> I feel like this channel is too busy sometimes to get help
[04:56] <WACOMalt> I love it. its like if Gnome 2 had kept being developed and improved along that path. None of that touch UI, overly-simplified stuff.
[04:56] <chamunks> Is there a decent visudo line I can add that will allow me to scp into my box without a password
[04:56] <bashinate> i'm gonna re-install, looks like only option at this point
[04:57] <bashinate> chamunks: you can setup ssh keys
[04:57] <bashinate> and then you can scp without a passwd
[04:58] <somsip> chamunks: set up SSH key access. If you have a valid key for the machine you're connecting to, it will use it without prompting (if there is no password on the key)
[04:58] <chamunks> bashinate, Holy hell thank you very much.
[04:58] <chamunks> bashinate, I've been /bin/bash'ing my head against my desk for hours trying to figure this out.
[04:58] <bashinate> ssh-keygen -t rsa
[04:58] <bashinate> that will create the public / private key pair
[04:59] <chamunks> bashinate, and I can install that ssh keypair into the root user then via sudo>?
[04:59] <chamunks> would that let this be possible?
[05:00] <bashinate> you can login with ssh keys as root if thats what your asking ?
[05:00] <bashinate> or whatever other user you want
[05:00] <chamunks> bashinate, yes because I need the webdev to have access to the webroot and he can only connect via filezilla/winscp
[05:00] <bashinate> yeah thats fine
[05:00] <somsip> chamunks: you are going to allow someone else root access to your server?
[05:01] <chamunks> somsip, this is just a testing box
[05:01] <bashinate> haha
[05:01] <chamunks> somsip, I'd rather be more fined grained with the controll access but i dont really know any other ways right now.
[05:01] <somsip> chamunks: you really would be better setting up safe permissions, but it's up to you
[05:01] <bashinate> yeah somsip is right, but thats your choice
[05:02] <somsip> chamunks: at the least, you could just add the dev user to www-data group so you keep him in /var/www
[05:02] <chamunks> somsip, I've been having nothing but nightmares getting the perms working I gave up at one point to see if chmod 777 would work but then it was just messing with me anyways and still giving me perm denied responses.
[05:02] <bashinate> i would never give a developer root, you can just create a user account for them and they can still login with ssh keys
[05:02] <chamunks> somsip, I couldnt find the name of that damn group earlier anywhere www-data ok I'll use that access control method in the main server.
[05:03] <chamunks> bashinate, well I have added him as that I tried that and even installed the webroot of his vhost inside his /home/
[05:03] <somsip> chamunks: from long, slow experience, it is well worth while learning about how to use permissions before you start doing things like this. It is a process of learning, but it's vital on servers open to others
[05:03] <bashinate> 777 on a server is just asking to get owned
[05:03] <bashinate> its the lucky number
[05:03] <lasindi> Hi all, I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 on my HP Pavilion g7. When I select "Try Ubuntu" or "Install" or "Check Disc for Errors" I just get a black screen. I saw online it might be due to my Radeon graphics card, but when I press Ctrl Alt F1 nothing happens. I did try entering the GRUB command environment, and it told me I could press Ctrl X to boot, but that doesn't work (the alternate key (don't remember what it was) does work). So I'm not sure if my C
[05:03] <lasindi> trl key doesn't work in GRUB for some reason, or where I can go from here.
[05:04] <chamunks> somsip, yeah im usually fine with this method its just tonight im throwing my hands up because this server isnt that important its just meant to essentially be testing anyway
[05:04] <chamunks> bashinate, oh god I know very much about 777 :P
[05:04] <somsip> chamunks: I understand. Just trying to offer advice, but take it as it's needed right now.
[05:04] <chamunks> bashinate, I was just trying to see if my system was just screwing with me or not and obviously its trolling .
[05:04] <cub> lasindi, maybe try reburning the CD?
[05:04] <chamunks> somsip, sorry I'm just happy to be close to a glueey solution for now :P
[05:05] <cub> could be a bad burn... i would think if should still run if you were presented with the menu, the "check disc for errors" should run.
[05:05] <somsip> chamunks: no worries
[05:05] <cub> as it doesnt boot into any graphical mode for that

[05:25] <cfhowlett> DWSR, USS doesn't require unity ...

[05:26] <DWSR> TheLordOfTime: Yes.
[05:26] <TheLordOfTime> cfhowlett, ^
[05:26] <tokie> why is it not supported here?
[05:26] <kouriinu> is there a chat room i can get help with wine or playonlinux ?
[05:26] <TheLordOfTime> DWSR, you'd need to get a list of what kernels you have installed firstly.
[05:26] <TheLordOfTime> DWSR, i don't know the command offhand to do that in the command line
[05:26] <DWSR> kouriinu: Wine has an IRC channel.
[05:27] <TheLordOfTime> DWSR, once you have that list, you can sudo apt-get remove [packages]
[05:27] <somsip> DWSR: dpkg --get_selections | grep linux
[05:27] <somsip> *--get-selections
[05:27] <kouriinu> is it #wine?
[05:27] <TheLordOfTime> just don't remove the latest kernel packages ;)
[05:27] <DWSR> somsip: That's to just get a list of kernels?
[05:27] <somsip> DWSR: source and headers and kernels. The often come in sets
[05:28] <kouriinu> or does anyone know how to get to the wine channel
[05:28] <zykotick9> kouriinu: /join #winehq
[05:28] <somsip> DWSR: then uname -r, and remove any taht aren't the same. With care :)
[05:29] <DWSR> I have a kernel that's older than the latest installed on my system.
[05:29] <DWSR> herp
[05:29] <kouriinu> there is no one in there
[05:29] <DWSR> s/have/am using/
[05:29] <kouriinu> is there a place with someone in it
[05:30] <DWSR> kouriinu: http://www.winehq.org/irc
[05:30] <DWSR> kouriinu: There is definitely people in there at the moment.
[05:30] <somsip> DWSR: law of diminishing returns. If you don't need to remove it, it's not doing any harm. Otherwise just sudo apt-get remove linux-image-{package number}
[05:30] <DWSR> somsip: Freeing up disk space.
[05:31] <kouriinu> i will do my best to get in there
[05:31] <malkauns> ;;ticker
[05:32] <somsip> DWSR: if you're that low on space, you may need to do more. sudo apt-get clean can often give a big immediate and safe freeing up of space
[05:32] <DWSR> somsip: Already working on it.

[05:34] <DWSR> somsip: Yes./
[05:34] <DWSR> did dist-upgrade.
[05:34] <Guest94090> did i say gnome, i ment to say grub

[06:09] <xrs> yup. you have more money than i do sorry.   all i can do is google for you
[06:09] <xrs> do you have bluman installed?

[06:10] <Kaedalus> It shows the bluetooth symbol - and it says it's turned on. You can turn it on and off there, by the dropdown menu, but if you access the actual Bluetooth Configuration, it is always OFF and can't be turned ON.
[06:10] <Kaedalus> I can't find anything like that around - I may be a terrible googler though. x_x''
[06:11] <asilhouette> anybody help with Software Center FCs
[06:11] <xrs> well lets open a terminal window and type "lsusb -v"
[06:12] <xrs> that should tell us what chipset the bluetooth is, then we can google that

[06:13] <Kaedalus> xrs, did it. That's... quite a lot of info.
[06:13] <xrs> asilhouette,  open a terminal window and run sudo apt-get remove software-center

[06:18] <stevo_> @doan , not sure i'll have to give it a try , i'm currently running it in window mode
[06:19] <xrs> Kaedalus,  my bad, the -v switch was unnessesary. lets run just lsusb without the -v
[06:19] <Kaedalus> Okay.

[06:28] <Kaedalus> Oh boy...
[06:28] <xrs> dealextreme claims it works out of the box
[06:28] <Kaedalus> I see...
[06:28] <Kaedalus> Thanks for the help.
[06:29] <Kaedalus> As it worked on LinuxMint, I thought it'd work on Ubuntu, heh.
[06:29] <Ben64> but its a vm
[06:29] <Kaedalus> I tried some things before moving to a VM.
[06:30] <xrs> yeah changing back over to mint would probably be cheaper than buying a new bluetooth dongle
[06:30] <dr_willis> Weird that a BT dongle dosent work on the same kernel on differnt disrtos.

[06:52] <dr_willis> from what ive seen.. if a webcam dont work with cheese.. it tends to be totally unsupported by linux. But theres always new kernel updates that may add support later.
[06:52] <dr_willis> waqarr:  last i looked theres no official ubuntu-phone os to install.

[07:29] <dr_willis> it definatly rembers here on 12.10
[07:29] <dr_willis> You havent disabled the gnome-keyring?
[07:29] <dr_willis> I seem to recall a check box or setting in network manager also for 'allow users, or all users' or somthing like that also.

[07:33] <mistere> file sharing

[07:33] <dr_willis> 'file shareing' can be done a dozen ways.. ;)
[07:34] <mistere> dr_willis, when i enter this command then show error"Failed to add entry for user **"
[07:35] <dr_willis> mistere:  what command did you use exactly?
[07:35] <anthony__> i need help making a bootable usb with ubuntu 11.10 on it. i am using my brothers windows laptop. i used the pendrive linux program that ubuntus website said too. t my computer just wont boot it
[07:36] <dr_willis> anthony__:  the pendrivelinux site has a dozen differnt tools you could try.  test the pendrive out on  other pcs if you can. it may be a pc issue. not a pendrive issue
[07:36] <mistere> sudo smbpasswd -a user
[07:36] <dr_willis> mistere:  you DID use the proper username?
[07:36] <mistere> dr_willis, yes
[07:36] <aeon-ltd> anthony__: check if the BIOS supports usb boot aswell
[07:36] <dr_willis> No idea then. unless you got some goofy users
[07:36] <anthony__> i only have this laptop. and only for tonight. ill try out t
[07:37] <mistere> anthony__, check the boot sequnce
[07:38] <mistere> dr_willis, now what is the problem?
[07:39] <anthony__> well i booted from a usb before. i made that bootable by using the usb creator on ubuntu . it worked ok but im missing drivers on my ubuntu now. i thin its cause i did a downgrade from 12.10. 12.10 didnt work well on my computer because my  video card wasnt goood enough
[07:39] <dr_willis> mistere:  no idea. try making a guest share and see if it works. I normally just set up home shares for the users via editing the smb.conf file. you should be able to set a samba password however.
[07:39] <cfhowlett> anthony__, what do you have installed now?
[07:39] <dr_willis> Ive never seen the failed to add entry... error
[07:40] <BillyZane> hi
[07:40] <dr_willis> for a Ubuntu to Ubuntu shareing. you could set up sshfs also. or if you want to get fancy. setup nfs.
[07:40] <cfhowlett> BillyZane, greetings
[07:40] <dr_willis> the samba logs in /var/log/ may give a clue why the shares are failing also
[07:41] <BillyZane> hi cfhowlett
[07:41] <BillyZane> how's it going dr_jesus
[07:41] <BillyZane> err dr_willis
[07:41] <anthony__> right now i hve 11.10 on it. but i think im missing drivers because i cant onnect to the interet and i cant mount a usb. so im going to try installing it again but it not working well on the POS laptop
[07:41] <mistere> dr_willis, thanks i'll try myself
[07:41] <dr_willis> They really need to smarten up Tab Completion on irc clients to put the  nicks in order of who last chatted. ;)
[07:41] <cfhowlett> anthony__, 11.10 has only  a few months of life left.  Why not install the 12.04 Long Term Support version?
[07:42] <Mayazcherquoi> Hey guys. What would be the best Ubuntu version for a computer newbie migrating from Windows? 12.04, or would the newer featureset in 12.10 be ideal? Keep in mind that it has nVidia hardware on it.
[07:42] <BillyZane> I have a question... i'm trying to install software that I have on a .iso file. I managed to mount the .iso file, but when i go in to the directory and type install , i get the error
[07:42] <mistere> anyone tell me how i install and config the XEN for virtualtion in Ubuntu
[07:42] <mistere> ?
[07:43] <dr_willis> !xen
[07:43] <ubottu> XEN is a virtual machine monitor for x86 that supports execution of multiple guest operating systems with unprecedented levels of performance and resource isolation. Information on installing it for Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xen
[07:43] <anthony__> because 11.10 was my favorite. wat hppens when the support runs out though. does it just not get any more updates or does it "die"

[07:45] <ClientAlive> cool. thx
[07:45] <dr_willis> factoids dont say when it goes EOL. ;)
[07:45] <Mayazcherquoi> :-/
[07:45] <anthony__> well ill probably go with 12.04 then. 11.10 and 12.04 were pretty similar. so i gues ill go with the lts of that. i still have the problem of booting it to my computer from my usb tho. lol
[07:45] <dr_willis> Mayazcherquoi:  depends on your needs. - you want latest stuff go latest.. you want long term support go LTS
[07:46] <Mayazcherquoi> dr_willis: I am trying to think from a usability stand point.
[07:46] <cfhowlett> anthony__, 12.04 will boot from USB but there are options ... PXE for one
[07:46] <dr_willis> Mayazcherquoi:  i doubt if it will matter much
[07:46] <Mayazcherquoi> Will a newbie-computer user, one that does not use social networks, benefit from an upgrade to 12.10 from 12.04?
[07:46] <anthony__> what do u mean?
[07:47] <Mayazcherquoi> anthony__: PXE boot == network boot.
[07:47] <dr_willis> Mayazcherquoi:  newer software and updated features in what you do use..
[07:47] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi, IMHO, no.
[07:47] <Mayazcherquoi> cfhowlett: Okay. Thank you.
[07:47] <kostkon> Mayazcherquoi, not really. go with 12.04. 5 years of support.
[07:47] <dr_willis> so it depends on what you DO. not what you 'dont do'
[07:47] <anthony__> o. well my omputer wont connect to my network. so thats probly outts the questiin lol
[07:47] <Mayazcherquoi> I have also read that trouble is encountered whilst trying to install nVidia drivers in 12.10. Is this also the case for 12.04?
[07:48] <kostkon> Mayazcherquoi, ?
[07:48] <dr_willis> Mayazcherquoi:  it can depend on the exact nvidia chipset
[07:48] <dr_willis> i have very few issues with nvidia on any of the last 5+ releases
[07:48] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi, not much difference between Nvidia on 12.04 and 12.10
[07:48] <Mayazcherquoi> dr_willis: Browse the web, look at YouTube, edit word documents.
[07:48] <dr_willis> Mayazcherquoi:  libreoffice will be newer in 12.10 if thats imporntant to you
[07:49] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi,  or you can install libreoffice in 12.04
[07:49] <aeon-ltd> is there a ubuntu rolling release version?
[07:49] <Mayazcherquoi> dr_willis: Okay. From your expert opinion, if you were in position, which direction would you go (Latest stable, or LTS)?
[07:49] <dr_willis> aeon-ltd:  no there is not.
[07:49] <cfhowlett> aeon-ltd, no.
[07:49] <Mayazcherquoi> aeon-ltd: No.
[07:49] <dr_willis> Mayazcherquoi:  i never stick with LTS. i dont see much point in it for a home user.
[07:49] <aeon-ltd> seems it would benefit those who don't like large changes to their distro
[07:50] <Mayazcherquoi> Okay. Thank you.
[07:50] <cfhowlett> aeon-ltd, then they should just use LTS
[07:50] <dr_willis> aeon-ltd:  and be a detriment when you update and some app stops working.. till the next weeks updates.. ;)
[07:51] <Mayazcherquoi> Would it be possible to somehow tune Ubuntu to use the latest PPA for software such as LibreOffice, and say Firefox?
[07:51] <BillyZane> dr_willis: why do i have to type ./install to run the install file?
[07:51] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi, sure

[07:52] <Mayazcherquoi> No. Whilst in 12.04
[07:52] <Mayazcherquoi> Instead of only getting security fixes
[07:53] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi, you can add ppa and as those ppa's get updated, you can update them as well.
[07:53] <megha> can some ome highligh me ?
[07:53] <Mayazcherquoi> Okay, cheers.

[07:53] <Mayazcherquoi> cfhowlett: Oh, hang on. One last question.
[07:53] <helmut_> hi
[07:53] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi, go ahead
[07:53] <Mayazcherquoi> I read that 12.10 ships with a nicer GRUB interface. Any way to get this backported to 12.04?
[07:54] <Mayazcherquoi> (I am just thinking for simplicity sake)
[07:54] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi, enable backports in your software center and it might come down.  or you can manually/carefully edit your grub interface
[07:54] <mizz> Hello PPL on IRC
[07:54] <Mayazcherquoi> cfhowlett: Okay, ta.
[07:54] <awisepilot> I am having problem ssh to a new KVM I setup with a static IP
[07:54] <Mayazcherquoi> cfhowlett: Ta :-)

[07:55] <Mayazcherquoi> cfhowlett: I dunno. I'm just thinking in case an accident happens, and whatnot.
[07:55] <awisepilot> How do I SSH to a new KVM guest?
[07:55] <cfhowlett> Mayazcherquoi, noted
[07:56] <ClientAlive> ok, deleting the partitions and starting fresh sounded like a good way to go for me. I did that. Can anyone recommend a new partition layout? Do I need more than one massive formatted space considering Ubuntu to be installed after this too?
[07:56] <awisepilot> virst list --all shows it running
[07:56] <cfhowlett> ClientAlive, depends on your arrangement.  Ubuntu only on this machine?
[07:56] <curseorange> i just deleted like 40gb of stuff... but when i look at my available space it hasnt changed, any ideas?

[07:57] <awisepilot> Anyone familar with KVM guest on 12.04 server?
[07:57] <ClientAlive> I guess what I'm thinking about is the efi partition but don't know much about how that works (if it's separate unto itself or not)
[07:57] <BillyZane> i'm trying to install software on ubuntu from an iso. I want to install it to /usr/local/MATLAB/R2012b/ , however, it says permission denied to create folder. I created the folder with mkdir manually, so the foldiers exist, but I still get a permission error. What should I do to give it super user access?
[07:58] <ClientAlive> do I need to create a separate efi partition?

[08:01] <zykotick9> awisepilot: are you sure your static ip is valid/working?  is it in the same network as your host?  by default i'd guess your kvm is using NAT.
[08:01] <mistere> awisepilot, use "sudo apt-get purge filename "

[08:03] <saju_m> <mistere> i can't edit that
[08:04] <saju_m> <mistere> see http://dpaste.com/895029/
[08:04] <awisepilot> zykotick9 - br0 is 192.168.2.178, bcast 192.168.2.255, net 192.168.2.0, mask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.2.1, eth0 is physical interface, guest kvm is vnet0, virbr0 is 192.168.122.1
[08:05] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  to write to system directories you will need to run the installer as root via sudo
[08:05] <zykotick9> awisepilot: wow, that looks pretty valid.  are you sure network-manager isn't messing with things?  does your eth0 have an ip currently (it shouldn't btw)?
[08:05] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  it may be safer to let the user install it in their own home directory
[08:08] <NewUser_> how can i know my ipv6 range?
[08:08] <zykotick9> awisepilot: oh, how are you starting your vm?  try with sudo.
[08:09] <awisepilot> Here is my vmbuilder script - http://pastebin.com/phEG9x6t
[08:10] <zykotick9> awisepilot: i've never used vmbuilder before... and don't visit pastebin.com.  so best of luck.
[08:11] <levo> what's the most fancy style?
[08:11] <levo> gnome, xfce ,  unity?
[08:11] <levo> or any other one/
[08:11] <levo> fancy desktop
[08:11] <cfhowlett> levo, style?  you mean desktop environment?
[08:11] <levo> yes
[08:12] <cfhowlett> levo all are adaptable and customizable.  Install them on your box for free and see
[08:12] <cfhowlett> levo, and don't forget lxde
[08:12] <levo> how is it?
[08:13] <cfhowlett> levo, sudo apt-get install lxde
[08:13] <levo> if i install it , can i use my previous desktop as well?
[08:13] <xrs> xfce is better
[08:13] <xrs> yes
[08:13] <levo> i'm looking for a pretty one
[08:13] <cfhowlett> levo, yes.  when you logout you can choose which to use
[08:13] <levo> unity isn't flexible
[08:14] <levo> i'm using 12.04
[08:14] <xrs> kde has the most eye candy. xfce is the best
[08:14] <levo> what's the benefits of xfce ? and its difference with lxde?
[08:15] <xrs> kinda like mac vs windows
[08:15] <awisepilot> Does anyone know how to troubleshoot vmbuilder kvm that will not ssh to the new created running guest?
[08:15] <cfhowlett> levo, dude.  Just install and try them out for yourself and/or please take this conversation to #ubuntu-offtopic

[08:28] <xrs> RAcEBOT,  https://www.trustedsec.com/downloads/social-engineer-toolkit/
[08:28] <RAcEBOT> wrs that website does not help me
[08:28] <kristian-aalborg> I just had a scare... My box booted and performed a disk check... which is okay, of course... but THEN it rebooted and gave me a text grub
[08:28] <cfhowlett> kristian-aalborg, and ... ?
[08:28] <kristian-aalborg> I just started the usual flavor, and it booted as usual (but a bit slower)
[08:29] <xrs> RAcEBOT,  no but the ISO you download from there has everything you've been asking for and more all night. you would have had this done by now had you tried it.
[08:29] <aeon-ltd> RAcEBOT: the easiest way, would be to just plug into your router with eth then go to it's ip and look it up
[08:29] <kristian-aalborg> the machine should not reboot after a disk check!
[08:29] <cfhowlett> kristian-aalborg, NO reboot at all?
[08:30] <kristian-aalborg> cfhowlett, it should just resume the boot after the check, I believe?
[08:30] <cfhowlett> kristian-aalborg, that is the normal behavior..  If not, do a hard reboot
[08:31] <red82> wow, big channel
[08:31] <kristian-aalborg> cfhowlett, ah, I'm relieved now
[08:31] <yellabs-r2> ah i already found the answer ..

[08:46] <ubottu> You're welcome! But keep in mind I'm just a bot ;-)

[08:56] <Bollsaq> cfhowlett: don't you think that was the first place I asked???
[08:56] <Ademan> basically an abridged version of !fr !de !cn etc compressed into one factoid
[08:56] <cfhowlett> Bollsaq, hey, uh, bollsaq?  attitude ...
[08:56] <Ademan> so you don't have to figure out what somebody's native language is before picking the factoid
[08:57] <cfhowlett> Bollsaq, you asked for help, I suggested a resource since no other help was offered ...
[08:57] <lhavelund> Ademan: Unnecessary. Additionally, this conversation is offtopic for this channel.
[08:57] <Bollsaq> cfhowlett: I had the impression you were giving me attitude, but thought the question here also was ok because its a slow chat atm
[08:58] <xwalk> Does anyone have any experience getting the Logitech C525 to function properly with Ubuntu 12.04?
[08:58] <cfhowlett> Bollsaq, ok.  no worries.  Also, maybe a kdenlive user in #ubuntustudio might be able to help out.
[08:59] <Ademan> lhavelund: I disagree, as if there's an insurmountable language barrier, then communicating to them "what's your native language" is difficult in and of itself. As for the off-topicness here, I'll drop it beyond this comment.

[09:01] <Bollsaq> cfhowlett: it would probably be faster that way anyhow.

[09:02] <sagaci> how does one create a wallpaper folder that rotates wallpapers automatically? There is a default setting that rotates the included wallpapers, but no options for user-created folders

[09:03] <Bollsaq> cfhowlett: I'm seeing if I can save the files to the same usb the live iso is on.
[09:04] <dr_willis> sagaci:  there used to be a .xml file i recall that defined how they got rotated. i saw a script/tool ages ago on either omgubuntu or webupd8 that would generate such a .xml for you for a directory of images.
[09:04] <dr_willis> sagaci:  or just use some wallpaper changer app

[09:12] <codephobic> hi
[09:12] <cfhowlett> codephobic, greetings
[09:13] <codephobic> hi cfhowlett
[09:14] <nuxninja> hi codephobic
[09:15] <codephobic> I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and I have an AMD/ATI Radeon HD 3000 on-board gfx chip. Is it possible to get the desktop cube working with this card? I read that the proprietary Catalyst driver (12.6), isn't compatible with the current X-Server and most articles seem to just advice waiting for AMD to do something in the future...
[09:15] <codephobic> hi nuxninja
[09:16] <nuxninja> hmmmmmmmmmmm
[09:17] <nuxninja> codephobic but have you tried the amdccc 12.6
[09:19] <codephobic> nuxninja, to be honest, I've stayed away from testing it out as I have had a few horrible issues with on-board gfx and proprietary drivers in linux (both debian squeeze and previous ubuntu had issues with my old nvidia drivers)
[09:19] <ls89> codephobic: They released catalyst 13.1 already.
[09:19] <codephobic> ls89, I was just at the AMD website, checked for the latest driver for my Radeon HD3000 series and it was 12.6
[09:19] <sagaci> dr_willis, thanks for the tip
[09:20] <ls89> codephobic: 13.1 is working with the current X-server from 12.10, but it currently fails to switch to the integrated card. So, you have to stick with the dedicated then.
[09:20] <nuxninja> codephobic nvidia has more problems than AMD on linux...i have been using amdccc for 4 years now.....no problems whatsoever.
[09:21] <nuxninja> 13.1 is not recommended for Radeon 3000 only 12.6 is sagaci
[09:21] <codephobic> nuxninja, I experienced some of those problems first hand, when I had to install the proprietary drivers to get access to Compiz in Debian and Ubuntu
[09:21] <ls89> Oh, just read HD3000  thought the intel one.
[09:21] <nuxninja> codephobic try it .... try and install amdccc 12.6..
[09:22] <codephobic> nuxninja, do you see any notable improvement in graphics speed and do you get the 3D cube stuff?
[09:22] <ls89> But the 13.1 is been released as legacy driver, too.
[09:22] <nuxninja> im using Radeon 6790 with 13.1 ......rock solid. codephobic
[09:23] <codephobic> nuxninja, yes but AMD's Catalyst is supposed to work okay with 5000 series and up
[09:23] <nuxninja> testing 650Ti with 310.19......works nicely but the usual black and white screens on compiz shift-switcher
[09:23] <codephobic> the problem is particular to the "legacy" devices of the 2000-4000 series
[09:23] <ixio2> guys whats the best way to get the AMD drivers installed, I have an A8 APU I also need sound to go out via HDMI. I have, in the past had issues with sound using FGLRX, I have had success with AMD propietry beta drivers, but they have a watermark/overlay.. its been a few months and this is my first 12.10 installation so looking for advise
[09:24] <nuxninja> No AMDccc 12.6 is for Radeon 3000
[09:24] <nuxninja> ixio2 same thing install amdccc 13.1 from amd.com website
[09:24] <nuxninja> hdmi only works with amdccc
[09:25] <nuxninja> codephobic you have problems and so do i with 12.10 then try use 12.04 its rock solid
[09:25] <codephobic> nuxninja, that's what seems to be the advice ... go back to 12.04 :(
[09:26] <ClientAlive> I'm begging an ubuntu install to make it a dual boot win 8/Ubuntu 12.04 system. At the "installation type" prompt (with the ubuntu install) it tells me: "This computer currently has no detected operating systems..." But win 8 is on here. What do I do?
[09:26] <qasim> please help me....i want  to play blue ray ripped MKV videos...but all i get choppy resolution and broken frames
[09:26] <codephobic> oh well, I'm going to have to have patience... either that or I'll buy a new graphics card :D

[09:29] <codephobic> ClientAlive, I find that if grub doesn't locate an OS at install time, I can still work it either by using Windows bootloader or by updating grub using "apt-get install grub2; update-grub"
[09:29] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  last laptop i had.. suprised me.. it had spots for 2 hds ;)
[09:29] <ixio2> nuxninja "embedded graphics" ?
[09:29] <dr_willis> it also weighed like 16 lbs.. ;)
[09:30] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: mine does
[09:30] <ClientAlive> dr_willis:  well I don't really want a non lts relase so I'd like to find a soln
[09:30] <nuxninja> qasim download from nvidia.com graphics for linux
=== ducch is now known as Happzz
[09:30] <codephobic> nuxninja, sadly that "rock-solid" is only good for previous Ubuntu versions
[09:30] <nuxninja> codephobic correct\
[09:30] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  try a gparted cd and see wht it says about the hd.
[09:30] <qasim> nuxninja, unfortunately i id that too on my previous xubuntu OS but it dint resolve the problem
[09:30] <prih> ciao
[09:30] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  be sure you got restore media made for windows
[09:30] <prih> !list
[09:30] <ubottu> prih: No warez here! This is not a file sharing channel (or network); read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».
[09:30] <qasim> did that**
[09:30] <ClientAlive> can I somehow find out the measure of the existing partitions, tell this step in ubu to have me manually partition, then make it start the partitions after that measured distance?
[09:31] <dr_willis> prih:  do you list every channel you join? WHy?
[09:31] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: this sounds like a painfully long journey I'm in for
[09:31] <ikonia> ClientAlive: please try to rephrase your question
[09:31] <nuxninja> see howto install nvidia proprietary drivers on google search or askubuntu.com  ....you will have to install something like nvidia-swat.....check
[09:32] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  ;)  and on a new windows laptop - i find their 'make restore disk' apps seem to take 3+ hrs to make a 3 dvd set....
[09:32] <ixio2> man I dont get this.. of all the dropdowns the only one that sounds close to an APU is "embedded graphics", the  A8 has a AMD HD 5670.. this does not appear in the sub-menu after choosing embedded
[09:32] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  i would see what gparted says about your windows 8 setup.  the LTS version may never get the  updated kernel for full support of new laptops.. they are getting rather complex these days. ;)
[09:33] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: After selecting the option that lets me manually partition, I am seeing my existing partitions. I just want to be certain what I'm looking at before I go too far.
[09:33] <qasim> nuxninja, no i mean i had successfully installed nvedea graphics card and i changed my graphics settings from xserver to nvedea but it dint resolve the problem
[09:33] <qasim> installed nvedea graphics card driver*
[09:33] <ixio2> perhaps the A8 is not classed as an APU ?
[09:33] <nuxninja> ixio2 dekstop graphics-apu-follow ahead ;)
[09:33] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  you may want to ask in #windows what the partions are for. MS  and vendors have been dong weird stuff with disk partions in recent years
[09:33] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: I see my efi partition and a partition it calls sda1 (which I think is where win 8 is).
[09:33] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: good idea
[09:34] <nuxninja> did you install something like swat qasim
[09:34] <dr_willis> between the special boot partion windows likes now.. and the efi partions.. i barely know what they all do.
[09:34] <qasim> im not sure
[09:34] <qasim> i dont know  what that is
[09:35] <ixio2> thanks nuxninja, depending on what page you access it from APU does or does not appear in the desktop list
[09:35] <ixio2> but found it now
[09:35] <nuxninja> it installs the proprietary drivers which disables the kernel driver .....then after that you have to install nvidia driver from site.....google search qasim
[09:35] <ixio2> :)
[09:36] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: I can tell what 3 of the partitions are and it's expected it would be that (looks right). But there is a sda3 where it says "unknown" in the "used" column of the partition editor. 134 mb with no file format listed.
[09:36]  * nuxninja  drags ixio2 by the collar and throws him out
[09:36] <qasim> nuxninja, if you mean it helps installing the nvidea driver...then i did that i had to uninstall kernal driver i lost my display than i ran nvidea driver commands to install and set ...the driver was working properly
[09:36] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  may be a special boot partion. would be my guess
[09:37] <qasim> nuxninja, and it did disable the kernal(X server ) driver
[09:37] <Jay2001> Hi all
[09:37] <nuxninja> NO qasim no need to install ....there is no uninstall procedure
[09:37] <nuxninja> sorry qasim i mean nothing to uninstall
[09:38] <qasim> nuxninja, oh okay ..i better google what swat is
[09:38] <codephobic> I've got another question as well. I setup some custom keyboard shortcut keys (WinKey+Ctrl + 0-9) and I want to be able to export/import the shortcuts ... where/how do I find them on the system?
[09:39] <Jay2001> I has a question. I am having trouble getting Wi-Fi to work on a desktop. I have tried 2 adaptors (one USB, one PCI) with no luck and have upgraded the OS from 11.10 to 12.10 with still no success. Can anyone recomend a good PCI card I can go and buy that will just slot in, be detected and work with minimum (read 'no') effort.
[09:39] <nuxninja> nvidia swat....or better 'how to install nvidia proprietary drivers on ubuntu' --google search qasim
[09:39] <qasim> nuxninja, btw i mean i had to terminate the already running process when i said i uninstalled the kernal driver ..sorry
[09:39] <precy> Fuck you ubuntu
[09:39] <precy> :P
[09:39] <qasim> nuxninja, olrite thanks let me google it
[09:39] <dr_willis> Jay2001:  i tend to hit amazon.com and check their user reviews.. i picked up 3 differnt USB wifi dongles that work in ubuntu and linux with no hassles
[09:40] <precy> awsome ubuntu
[09:40] <precy> :D
[09:41] <ixio2> you guys know what the pre-reqs are to install the AMD propiertry driver ?
=== sharky2 is now known as sharky
[09:42] <xrs> i havent been able to get the amd drivers working since 12.10
[09:43] <Jay2001> dr_willis: The issue there is that the USB adaptor I tried was listed as working but the manufacturer had changed chipset without changing model number so it no longer worked even though reviews said it did.
[09:43] <nuxninja> ixio2 from terminal : sudo  bash <amdccc 13.1...............>.xh
[09:44] <ixio2> nuxninja: I did ./amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.1-linux-x86.x86_64.run
[09:44] <nuxninja> Hallo DrManhattan how's the city doin?? :)
[09:44] <ixio2> is this not the right file ?
[09:44] <dr_willis> Jay2001:  seen that happen in the past with modems also.  of course i picked up 3-4 diffent usb dongles for under  $15 each. ;) one was $5 off amazon. so far they have all been plug and play on ubuntu. and even worked on some of my Linux based media players. an added bonus
[09:44] <nuxninja> like i said above ixio2.....use bash
[09:45] <ixio2> I thoguth I was using bash lol
[09:45] <dr_willis> ixio2:  if the file is not executable you do  'bash foo.run'  perhaps
[09:45] <ixio2> ok I did sudo bash ./amd-driver-installer-catalyst-13.1-linux-x86.x86_64.run with the same result "Onoe or more tools required for instgallation cannot be found on the systme"
[09:45] <dr_willis> ixio2:  or sh foo.run        or chmod +x foo.run   then ./foo.run
[09:45] <ShapeShifter499> Hi
[09:45] <ixio2> I already chmod +x the file
[09:46] <nuxninja> qasim are you there  i got site to install http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/10/install-nvidia-driver-31014-on-ubuntu.html

[09:53] <ixio2> nuxninja same result with or without the ./
[09:53] <nuxninja> what error ixio2
[09:54] <minas> hi. At the top bar of my screen, some small rectangles appear and disappear rapidly: http://i46.tinypic.com/2zokh2g.png  Any idea how this can be fixed?
[09:54] <Ben64> Jay2001: oh uk
[09:54] <ixio2> nuxninja: its ok linux-headers is a dependency installed that and now its working
[09:55] <nuxninja> see ixio2 its all weeny problems
[09:55] <ixio2> theres no readme, no FAQ.. its pretty bad
[09:55] <nuxninja> Nvidia is worse ixio2
[09:56] <ixio2> with nvidia I just had to open the "propietry drivers" dialogue and tell it yeah ok I accept
[09:56] <ixio2> and it worked
[09:57] <nuxninja> no ixio2 that's for older drivers ....newer ones it hell
[09:57] <ShapeShifter499> nuxninja: what does the patch fix?  The issue where vmware can't find the kernel header files?
[09:57] <ixio2> oh.. been a while since I used nvidia
[09:57] <nuxninja> then ShapeShifter499 install kernel-headers ....i had problem with workstation 9 and got fixed by vmware-patch
[09:58] <ShapeShifter499> I have them installed I just need to point vmware to their location which I don't know
[09:58] <nuxninja> ok
[09:59] <ShapeShifter499> Goes back to my original question, where are the kernel header files installed to?
[10:01] <ikonia> ShapeShifter499: /usr/share normally
[10:02] <smartypants2013> hi, can anyone recommend a good tool for monitoring web server bandwidth/traffic
[10:03] <Shine1> a
[10:05] <keelG> smartypants2013: I guess you could use something like nagios - or are you after something textbased? In that case Smokeping and iPerf might be what you are looking for
[10:05] <keelG> smartypants2013: however iperf and smokeping are more tools for measuring the network
[10:06] <Shine1> hei
[10:07] <cfhowlett> Shine1, greetings
[10:08] <Shine1> cfhowlett hi

[10:12] <dogears> How do I install the Nvidia driver on 12.10?
[10:12] <martin___> !nvidia | dogears
[10:12] <ubottu> dogears: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto

[10:13] <Hyperiant> My power button does nothing when pressed, but powers down when I hold it; it seems that the system isn't receiving input from it
[10:14] <Hyperiant> Rather, that Ubuntu isn't reading my presses
[10:14] <fdf> Hi, there is any boot cd will auto increase  / ext4 none lvm  partition like Gparted just without user interference? (for vmware disk resize) thanks
[10:15] <ClientAlive> So if I do a windows / ubuntu dial boot, what are some options for formatting storage partition?
[10:16] <ClientAlive> ntfs sucks and windows won't read ext
[10:16] <ClientAlive> what are my options?
[10:16] <koegs> exFat or FAT32
[10:17] <ClientAlive> koegs: never heard of exFat. is that something new? Some kinda lingo?
[10:17] <savita-bhabhi> FAT32 works well
=== william__ is now known as will_i_am
[10:18] <koegs> FAT32 is limited to <4GB Files
[10:18] <ClientAlive> can I use a samba share with ext filsystem and just connect the share in windblows
[10:18] <ClientAlive> ?
[10:19] <ClientAlive> linux matters, windoze is forced on my by my school
[10:19] <Hyperiant> ClientAlive: Why don't you just partition part of the drive NTFS and the other ext?
=== savita-bhabhi is now known as nuxninja
[10:20] <nuxninja> ClientAlive lucky me no school
[10:20] <ClientAlive> Hyperiant: wasted space
[10:20] <ClientAlive> nuxninja: ha ha
[10:20] <nuxninja> try samba-swat
[10:21] <ClientAlive> maybe I shoud be running windows in a vm (like someone else strongly suggested)
[10:21] <ClientAlive> idk
[10:21] <ClientAlive> then you have performance issue
[10:21] <Hyperiant> ClientAlive: What is it that you want to accomplish?
[10:21] <Guido1> Hello, i would like to ad a plugin to rhythembox, but i don't know how
[10:22] <ClientAlive> well dual boot win 8/ ubuntu 12.04 and all storage space ext4 would be nice
[10:22] <cfhowlett> Guido1, see #rhythmbox or projects.gnome.org/rhythmbox/
[10:22] <ClientAlive> but stupid windows will have to have some kind of storage eventually (probably sooner than later)
[10:22] <Hyperiant> ClientAlive: Then it's not wasted space to partition the drive
[10:23] <Guido1> cfhowlett: there seams no one to be online :-(
[10:23] <makara> hi. I set some jobs to run later when CPU load was down. Now I just want them to run no matter what. What command?
[10:23] <ClientAlive> I know, all my options suck
[10:23] <ClientAlive> I have to think about this
[10:23] <cfhowlett> !cron|makara,
[10:23] <ubottu> makara,: cron is a way to schedule execution of software/scripts. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CronHowto
[10:24] <Guido1> ubottu: perhaps crone could help me too
[10:24] <ubottu> Guido1: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[10:24] <nuxninja> Guido1 i dont use Rythmbox :P soree
[10:24] <Guido1> ubottu: can i start a playlist with it a a specific time?
[10:24] <ubottu> Guido1: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[10:25] <Hyperiant> How do you fix a power button not doing anything when pressed in 12.10?
[10:25] <cfhowlett> Guido1, pretty sure there must be a way feed a playlist to rhythmbox via terminal.  Find that and configure cron accordingly
[10:25] <makara> Hyperiant: sounds like a joke :)
[10:26] <nuxninja> ROFLMFAO
[10:26] <Hyperiant> makara: Holding the power button turns off the computer.  Pressing it is supposed to bring up a prompt.  It doesn't.
[10:26] <ClientAlive> what is vnc like - performance wise?  (I could run a windows vm on my desktop, which has a lot more resources, and vnce into it - maybe)
[10:26] <ClientAlive> *vnc*
[10:27] <cfhowlett> ClientAlive, if you only need occasional windows, consider installing a virtualbox
[10:27] <Guido1> nuxninja: perhaps you can help me anyway as i have to untar the plugin and to put it into a special folder - gnome2/rhythembox/plugins but i don't know where to find it and how to untar it at the place. i found one place and there untar doesent work
[10:27] <nuxninja> !ubotto  | vnc
[10:27] <cfhowlett> !vnc
[10:27] <ubottu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[10:27] <Hyperiant> makara: More accurately, I can turn off the laptop using the power button, but only because holding it down actually cuts power to the computer.  Ubuntu doesn't react at all when I press it.
[10:27] <nuxninja> use nautilus Guido1
[10:28] <nuxninja> nautilus
[10:28] <ClientAlive> cfhowlett: This is the sutuation (occasional as you say). I would prefer not to run a vm on the lappy as it's resources are, well, not limited but 'more limited'
[10:28] <ClientAlive> so I wonder what vnc is like since I've never used it. Does it lag?
[10:28] <Hyperiant> ClientAlive: Again, what is it you're trying to accomplish?
[10:29] <Hyperiant> ClientAlive: In terms of usability
[10:29] <ClientAlive> I'm trying to determine the truly best option for my needs
[10:29] <nuxninja> its lhi sooraj
[10:29] <Hyperiant> ClientAlive: And what are your needs?
[10:29] <nuxninja> hi sooraj
[10:29] <ClientAlive> Hyperiant: yeah, Is it like native performance?
[10:29] <cfhowlett> ClientAlive, tunneling into another machine is always slower than running from that machine natively ...
[10:30] <ClientAlive> I use linux (Ubuntu, specifically). My uni requires us to do some projects in a windows environment.
[10:30] <Guido1> nuxninja: do you have any idea where the folder is located? (gnome2/rhythembox/plugins)
[10:30] <Hyperiant> It would be slower than running it from a live CD and using persistence on a flash drive
[10:30] <ClientAlive> cfhowlett: I see. Like nocieable? Like mouse pointers freezing and shit?
[10:30] <prih> irc://irc.uragano.org/SunShiNe
[10:30] <ClientAlive> I see
[10:30] <nuxninja> no idea Guido1 .....
[10:31] <cfhowlett> ClientAlive, haven't used it enough to be able to say...
[10:31] <smartypants2013> thanks keelG
[10:31] <makara> Hyperiant, http://askubuntu.com/questions/66723/how-do-i-modify-the-power-options
[10:31] <nuxninja> but Guido1 type in terminal: whereis rythmbox
[10:31] <ClientAlive> alrighty then. I'll have to chew on this for a while
[10:31] <ClientAlive> thx fellas
[10:32] <Hyperiant> makara: I don't want an immediate shutdown from a button press, I want a prompt; it's the opposite problem that this guy is having

[10:47] <makara> in gconf-editor navigate to org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power and set your default button-power action to interactive
[10:47] <nuxninja> hi megha
[10:47] <dogears> iceroot: Yes the new user I created was a standard user and all is working.
[10:48] <trap24> nuxninja: yes its empty. i know that is the head just waking up to move or sth. but what can i do to fix it. it shakes. i need a smooth system :P
[10:48] <zvacet> hillary: sudo dpkg --configure -a
[10:48] <trap24> never seen so in windows
[10:48] <nuxninja> sorry no easy fix trap24
[10:48] <iceroot> hillary: you are installing packages from the repo? because /opt/mono does not sound like something from the repos
[10:48] <Hyperiant> makara: I'm running Lubuntu, though; will that still work in LXDE?
[10:48] <nuxninja> remove bay only option trap24
[10:48] <trap24> nuxninja: are you joking ?
[10:49] <makara> Hyperiant: no harm in trying
[10:49] <martti> w00t 3.8.0 ... I'm not used to have so recent stuff on this distro
[10:49] <nuxninja> no trap24 if it is under warranty cant help you but no warranty its unmountable
[10:49] <dogears> iceroot: The original admin user has the problems and I cant find the problems so I figure a clean user with the same name.
[10:50] <iceroot> dogears: more important would be the same uid
[10:50] <trap24> do we not have choice to load the drivers, i know cdrom is a very basic driver and loads using bios. but then again, we might have some ways to disable it for ubuntu session :D
[10:50] <iceroot> dogears: unix systems are only working with UIDs, the username itself is not important
[10:50] <nuxninja> trap24 from bios yes try there!!
[10:50] <Coffeecoco> I have a question in relation to ulimit -n

[10:51] <ubottu> washuu_de, please see my private message
[10:51] <Coffeecoco> i guess i was preparing you all :P
[10:51] <Coffeecoco> brace your self!
[10:51] <dogears> iceroot: Does the user ID refer to the original admin user?
[10:51] <trap24> nuxninja: i think i told you that. so, next time what would you do to disable a webcam or sth like that. usb or a hardware. you would unpin them ??
[10:51] <martti> Coffeecoco: great. now I get bored.
[10:52] <trap24> i don't want to move the driver file either
[10:52] <nuxninja> trap24 your problem is of physical noise webcam has no RELATION whatsoever..
[10:52] <Coffeecoco> I am aware of how a server / service is effected by ulimit -n and resources, I wish to know when you enable routing/forwarding, does the act of routing/forwarding have any effect with ulimit -n resources?
[10:53] <martti> Coffeecoco: hmm, those stacks aren't associated with a user or process, so, no
[10:53] <zykes->  /j amobil
[10:53] <iceroot> dogears: you can for example move the .dirs to another place and relogin with your admin-user
[10:54] <Coffeecoco> martti thanks i assume so much thank you for clearing that
[10:54] <mac_12> does anyone have idea if "1265 hard disk sectors damaged" have effects on the speed of my UBUNTU 12.04
[10:54] <mac_12> now it appears very slow
[10:54] <Coffeecoco> I datre say that "NAT" would take up resources though
[10:54] <Coffeecoco> dare*
[10:54] <dogears> iceroot: All the hidden directories?
[10:54] <hillary> i have pasted the output of sudo apt-get upgrade
[10:55] <martti> Coffeecoco: network load balancing can be done, but just in other ways than with ulimit.
[10:55] <iceroot> dogears: thats what i would do to see what the problem is and if it will fix the issue
[10:55] <iceroot> dogears: then i would restore the important ones (mozilla, wine and so on)
[10:55] <trap24> nuxninja: so, do you know hard fix ? (u said no easy fix except unpinning the drive from board )
[10:56] <Coffeecoco> martti i guess i wasnt going too deep into load balancing, just basic network address translation, i have a feeling that NAT would take up resources, is that a bit more clear?
[10:56] <dogears> iceroot: I will give it a go Thanks
[10:56] <nuxninja> sorry cant help trap24.
[10:56] <trap24> nuxninja: ok

[10:58] <samir06> Hello. I need a slight bit of assistance. I'm on Xubuntu. and when I type in sudo gedit nothing comes up. What can I replace gedit with?
[10:59] <donnie> zvacet so it would be sudo leafpad then the command?
[10:59] <dr_willis> donnie:  use gksudo for gui apps.. and see if gedit is installed. or install any of a dozen other text editors.. I perfer geany. ;)
[10:59] <zvacet> donnie: yes,because leafpad is text editor in xfce
[10:59] <martti> samir06: what about your question. are you the same guy as donnie

[11:06] <Noctifer> am i missing some kind of package?
[11:07] <jrib> Noctifer: have you restarted nautilus?
[11:07] <dr_willis> so you can as a user  'cp filename /media/username/theflashdrive'  but  you cant just drag/drop a file into /media/username/theflashdrive ?
[11:07] <martti> that usually depends on the mounting method, unless you're blindly trusting some kind of *kit. I don't know about that, never really used it.

[11:11] <dr_willis> just log out/back in
[11:11] <jrib> Noctifer: try this first: pkill -HUP nautilus
[11:11] <dr_willis> i wonder if it could be mounted twice... with differnt permissions.
[11:12] <jrib> there must be some bug in nautilus.  Someone had the same issue a while ago.  We debugged so much about permissions and mount options and it turned out nautilus just wasn't picking up the permissions until it was restarted for some reason.  Even hitting "reload" in nautilus wouldn't work
[11:12] <blkrdo> ubuntu 11.10 wont shutdown from unity gui after upgrde...

[11:15] <hillary> what do i do?

[11:15] <jrib> Noctifer: there's some sort of weird bug in nautilus where it won't detect changes in permissions even when you press reload (you should try pressing reload in nautilus and verifying it isn't enough).

[11:19] <dr_willis> and here i was looking for somthing from legaltorrents.org ;)
[11:19] <hillary> i seem not to be getting it correct. how do i check the line
[11:19] <Ben64> just send 12.04 torrent
[11:19] <jrib> hillary: head /etc/environment
[11:19] <admin0> apparently i mistook the iptables rules from one application and thought it was the default .
[11:20] <dr_willis> Ben64:  nah.. a 6.06  torrent would be funnier
[11:20] <Ben64> i've never understood the "ciao, !list" stuff

[11:25] <rax-> i.e. - create key pair, give a server the public key and verify it connects as expected. Create new VM from the machine that houses the private key and connect from the server containing the public key from the VM used for the template?
[11:25] <rax-> I could just try it but I'm just hoping for a quick answer
[11:26] <dr_willis> Ben64:  aparently they cant handle torrents..
[11:26] <dr_willis> hillary:  a simple command like 'head /etc/enviroment' and looking at line 2 has you defeated?

[11:30] <dr_willis> Hello
[11:32] <dr_willis> be right back
[11:35] <Coffeecoco> guys i have a little guide in front of me
[11:35] <Coffeecoco> and there suggesting ubuntu 11.04
[11:35] <Coffeecoco> think he means 12.4 ?
[11:35] <cfhowlett> Coffeecoco, old guide ?
[11:35] <Coffeecoco> err 12.04
[11:35] <cfhowlett> Coffeecoco, 12.04 is latest Long Term Support version ...
[11:35] <Coffeecoco> cfhowlett its one of them ones that " suppoted working tested on "
[11:36] <Coffeecoco> my question is
[11:36] <Coffeecoco> 11.04 is not valid
[11:36] <pat__> Is there still a "One Fell Swoop" command for installing a lamp server? ^lamp-server or something like that.
[11:36] <Coffeecoco> or exist ??
[11:36] <Ben64> !lamp | pat__
[11:36] <ubottu> pat__: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process.
[11:36] <ThinkT510> Coffeecoco: 11.04 is no longer supported
[11:36] <Coffeecoco> can anyone confirm there was a realease of ubuntu that is 11.04 ?
[11:36] <Coffeecoco> ^ that is my question
[11:37] <ThinkT510> Coffeecoco: yes, there was, it is no longer supported
[11:37] <Coffeecoco> ty
[11:37] <Coffeecoco> i dont care if its supported
[11:37] <pat__> Coffeecoco, wasn't that natty?
[11:37] <ThinkT510> !11.04 | Coffeecoco

[11:39] <zooz> how do I disable a service to start on boot?
[11:39] <pat__> Ben64, Found one of them -- installing taskel then running it lets you do it quickly.  There was another though that I remember...
[11:39] <pat__> zooz, what service?
[11:39] <zooz> pat__, any, let's say a service called "foobar"
[11:40] <MonkeyDust> zooz  is this useful http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[11:40] <dr_willis> that upstart cookbook doc site is worth reading.. ;)
[11:42] <pat__> zooz, what they said.  I waslooking for a GUI but I'm not familiar enough yet with unity.
[11:42] <jrib> zooz: depends on whether the service's init script is an upstart script (resides in /etc/init) or is still an old-style sys-v init script (resides in /etc/init.d)
[11:42] <dr_willis> ive seen no gui upstart manager tools
[11:42] <dogears> I cant shutdown my 12.10 computer?
[11:43] <dr_willis> dogears:  a rather common apci/powersaveing/bios/kernel quirk/bug sadly.
[11:43] <MonkeyDust> dogears  what happens when you try and did it work before?
[11:43] <dogears> What has changed from 12.04
[11:43] <dr_willis> a new kernel for one thing dogears
[11:43] <zooz> no, not GUI, I am talking about the server edition and let's say my service is an upstart service
[11:44] <dr_willis> zooz:  and you want to do what exactly with it
[11:44] <dogears> Monkeydust: it was perfect till I just did the last upgrade
[11:44] <zooz> dr_willis, I want my 'foobar' service not to start on boot
[11:44] <dr_willis> zooz:  upstart cookbook mentions 3 differnt ways to disable it...
[11:44] <MonkeyDust> dogears  plenty reviews, here's one http://www.linuxuser.co.uk/reviews/ubuntu-12-10-review-linux-users-biggest-ever-super-test
[11:44] <dr_willis> zooz:  easiest.. rename the foobar.conf to be foobar.dontrun in /etc/init/
[11:45] <dogears> dr_willis: The latest was just installed
[11:45] <Guido1> hello, is there a alarmcloc out there which can play a playlist or a rhythmbox plugin for that?
[11:46] <jrib> zooz: using manual overrides as described in the cookbook is better imo since it still allows you to use upstart to manage the service later (like if you want to start it manually after boot)
[11:47] <zooz> right, I see, I thought there was a command or something (ubuntu seems so immature when coming from real distributions like fedora or centos)
[11:47] <zooz> yet I am amazed how many people use it
[11:47] <MonkeyDust> zooz  please don't start
[11:47] <zooz> I will not
[11:47] <dr_willis> zooz:  wait till everyone changes to that systemd stuff... you will get totally stupified then
[11:48] <zooz> dr_willis, I love systemd, been using it for some time now
[11:48] <dr_willis> amazing thing about upstart.. its been in use for several realeases now.. and not a lot of people have even noticed the switch from sysv.
[11:48] <dr_willis> but i imagine its days are numbered.
[11:48] <zooz> dr_willis, is ubuntu going to switch to systemd?
[11:49] <dr_willis> zooz:  the rumor mill says yes.. eventually..
[11:49] <daze> :/
[11:49] <zooz> ah, great
[11:49] <daze> why is systemd good?
[11:49] <dr_willis> dont hold your breath for it to be soon.
[11:49] <zooz> sure
[11:49] <dr_willis>  the init system is an amazingly complex topic daze  once you start getting into it.. upstart fixs some of the problems.. systemd fixs a lot of them also.. in a radically differnt way. ;)
[11:50] <dr_willis> I barely understood half the reasons or issues with   init systems till i started reading up on the rather dry topic. ;)
[11:50] <daze> yeah, I read somewhere that systemd is a betrayal of unix principles and such
[11:50] <Noriandir>  hi. i'm having problems accessing my apache server through my external IP. I have it working for some time now and had no problems until today... =/
[11:50] <zooz> dr_willis, could you answer another question for me please? I don't get the point of being interrupted when installing packages, for instance installing mysql prompts me to enter root password and such
[11:51] <hillary> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1580753/
[11:51] <dr_willis> zooz:  never really worried about it. ;)  package managament - another very complex topic. :)
[11:51] <ThinkT510> zooz: using the package management should always prompt for your users password
[11:51] <zooz> ThinkT510, I am not talking about sudo password
[11:51] <MonkeyDust> that's called 'security'
[11:52] <kiwi65745> I think what zooz means is the mysql password
[11:52] <dr_willis> I thought all those questions got asked at the end of the package session,  where their c pkg config scripts were getting ran
[11:52] <dr_willis> so its  a post-install question actually
[11:52] <zooz> right dr_willis
[11:52] <kiwi65745> even i've faced this issue. It asks for the password during the installation of any software using apt-get
[11:52] <dr_willis> complex packages may need input.. thats just life.
[11:53] <dr_willis> or else ya got to go back then redo that command to configure them afterwards.. (i forget the command)
[11:53] <zooz> I have been using RPM-based packages for years and have never been prompted or interrupted during any package install
[11:53] <dr_willis> sudo dpkg-reconfigure -a  (ugh!) ;)
[11:53] <zooz> I think there is a way to turn this off
[11:53] <zooz> which is great
[11:53] <dr_willis> so how do you set the myswl password then.
[11:54] <kiwi65745> dr_willis why does mysql need authentication everytime i want to install ANOTHER software?
[11:54] <dr_willis> mysql asks for the mysql Root users password on install i recall
[11:54] <dogears> dr_willis: Do we wait for the fix? This was rebooting following the latest upgrade.
[11:54] <kiwi65745> yes, and then it asks you to authenticate the same everytime you install something else. I've faced this on debian as well.
[11:55] <lyda> dr_willis: debconf-set-selections is what you want to look at.
[11:55] <lyda> debconf-set-selections << EOF
[11:55] <lyda> mysql-server-5.1 mysql-server/root_password password $MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
[11:55] <lyda> mysql-server-5.1 mysql-server/root_password_again password $MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
[11:55] <lyda> EOF
[11:55] <dr_willis> I dont really do mysql :) so  i doubt if i have it installed on any of my systems
[11:55] <dogears> dr_willis: This was the latest upgrade.
[11:56] <ClientAlive> earlier today someone gage me an aptitude command to install packages from a file. I lost it. Does anyone know what that is again?
[11:56] <lyda> if you'd like to see what selections your packages currently use, debconf-get-selections
[11:56] <dr_willis> dogears:  and the next kernel update might fix it.. check the bug reports perhaps.
[11:56] <ClientAlive> *gave*
[11:56] <dr_willis> !clone > ClientAlive
[11:56] <ubottu> ClientAlive, please see my private message
[11:56] <dr_willis> be carefull with aptitude. ;)
[11:56] <dr_willis> theres other ways to install from a file list also.
[11:57] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: that's it. thx
[11:58] <MonkeyDust> ClientAlive  here's how I do it http://paste.ubuntu.com/1580797/
[11:59] <Noriandir> can anyone help me with my problem said above?
[11:59] <ubuntu> ck sdsgdg
[11:59] <MonkeyDust> Noriandir  it's easier if you simply repeated the question, in one line
[12:00] <Noriandir> here it is: i'm having problems accessing my apache server through my external IP. I have it working for some time now and had no problems until today... =/
[12:01] <MonkeyDust> Noriandir  ubuntu server? if yes: they have their own channel   #ubuntu-server
[12:01] <damian_^> hi, i installed plasma active via software center but im only getting the kde plasma desktop, not the tablet version. what package do i need (maybe a dummy package) or do i need to add a ppa or something?
[12:01] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: uhh. bash is telling me aptitude command not found. I looked and looked again and it is spelled right and in the correct case
[12:01] <Noriandir> now i've realised that my ssh access is having problems too. so its accessing the external ip and not the apache server only
[12:01] <Noriandir> MonkeyDust, no, its not ubuntu server
[12:01] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  apti<tab>  perhaps.
[12:01] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  i never use the command these days
[12:02] <arcsky> where do i find correct  source to my apt/source.list ?  squeeze/sid
[12:02] <ClientAlive> I see
[12:02] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  you did install aptitude?
[12:02] <iceroot> arcsky: #debian
[12:02] <dr_willis> arcsky:  ubuntu dosent use squeeze/sid
[12:03] <ClientAlive> dr_willis: shows me a list of possiblities. aptitude is not in the list
[12:03] <ClientAlive> am I missing some things?
[12:03] <iceroot> ClientAlive: dpkg -l aptitude
[12:03] <dr_willis> ClientAlive:  you did install aptitude?.... its NOT installed by default...
[12:03] <arcsky> dr_willis: how can i see what i run ?
[12:03] <iceroot> ClientAlive: what is the output
[12:03] <iceroot> arcsky: cat /etc/issue
[12:03] <dr_willis> !version | arcsky
[12:03] <ubottu> arcsky: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type « lsb_release -a » in a !shell - To know the available version of a package, « apt-cache policy <package> »
[12:03] <ClientAlive> I didn't know I had to
[12:04] <arcsky> dr_willis: Ubuntu 10.10 maverick
[12:04] <ClientAlive> man this thing is fast as hell!
[12:04] <dr_willis> arcsky:  may be time to upgrade
[12:04] <dr_willis> !10.10
[12:04] <ubottu> Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) was the thirteenth release of Ubuntu. !End-Of-Life on April 10th, 2012, see http://ubottu.com/y/maverick for details.
[12:05] <MonkeyDust> arcsky  start here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes
[12:05] <arcsky> do i must reboot after upgrade?
[12:05] <damian_^> hi, i installed plasma active via software center but im only getting the kde plasma desktop, not the tablet version. what package do i need (maybe a dummy package) or do i need to add a ppa or something?
[12:05] <dr_willis> a release upgrade-- will wnt a reboot yes
[12:05] <mvk> i would like to change a launcher icon, (a program im running, and pinned to the unity launcher)
[12:05] <iceroot> ClientAlive: you could also use "for a in $(< filename); do apt-get install "&a"; done
[12:05] <MonkeyDust> arcsky  a fresh innstall is fastest, easiest and cleanest
[12:05] <dr_willis> arcsky:  for that old a install.. a clean nstall may be a better idea
[12:05] <mvk> where do i start, i googled my *** off, i cant find it!
[12:06] <arcsky> its a server with good uptime
[12:06] <arcsky> dont want to reboot :p
[12:06] <iceroot> arcsky: a server?
[12:06] <arcsky> yes
[12:06] <arcsky> lab server
[12:06] <dr_willis> mvk:  take an existing  .desktop file and copy it.. and change it
[12:06] <dr_willis> mvk:  ie: copy gedit.desktop and  edit it how you want
[12:06] <iceroot> arcsky: a server running 10.10 which is EOL and does not get a reboot to install the newest kernel-fixes and so on?
[12:07] <iceroot> arcsky: i hope its not a public server
[12:07] <captine> mvk have u tried "main menu".  not it seems to allow you to select an icon
[12:07] <arcsky> ircnode0: public yes
[12:07] <iceroot> arcsky: ......
[12:07] <ClientAlive> iceroot: wow, I wish I understood bash script that well  :)
[12:07] <iceroot> arcsky: please dont do something like that, its full of security issues
[12:08] <arcsky> iceroot: ok can i do apt-get distupgrade ?
[12:08] <iceroot> arcsky: please dont host public servers if you dont know what you are doing
[12:08] <iceroot> arcsky: dist-upgrade is not installing a newer ubuntu version
[12:08] <iceroot> !eol | arcsky
[12:08] <ubottu> arcsky: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[12:08] <iceroot> arcsky: last link
[12:09] <MonkeyDust> arcsky  upgrading from 10.10 would take forever, clean install is faster
[12:09] <iceroot> MonkeyDust: its not faster
[12:09] <mvk> capri, where can i find main menu?
[12:10] <mvk> dr_willis, in what directory would that be?
[12:10] <dr_willis> after my last upgrade from a .4 to a .10 took 5 hrs... i found clean installs faster. ;)
[12:10] <iceroot> MonkeyDust: you have to backup, you have to see what packages are not anymore in 12.04, you have to reconfigure things (which is done by postinsts in the upgrade process) and so on
[12:10] <dr_willis> mvk:  learn to use the 'locate' command
[12:10] <ftruzzi> Hi, I want to install ubuntu, but for some reason BIOS is not booting from CD-ROM or USB, so I will make SYSLINUX to boot to the ubuntu ISO in my Download folder, there is any command to append to the boot process so that the ISO is copyed completely to RAM?
[12:11] <dr_willis> mvk:  locate  filename
[12:11] <iceroot> arcsky: but please do some reading about ubuntu or ask a unix-admin but please dont host public servers and say "i dont want to destroy my uptime with a reboot for security fixes"
[12:11] <MonkeyDust> arcsky  upgrade or fresh install, a lot of work to be done
[12:11] <iceroot> arcsky: that is the reason for open-spamrelays, warez-ftp server and so on
[12:13] <arcsky> hehe of course its not hacked
[12:13] <dr_willis> yea.. sure its not..
[12:14] <arcsky> but will do a fresh install
[12:14] <iceroot> arcsky: and you are sure because?
[12:15] <iceroot> arcsky: i bet your system has this "debian ssl bug" and you did not create new ssl-certs
[12:15] <iceroot> imo 10.10 was still affected by this bug
[12:16] <ftruzzi> Hi, I want to install ubuntu, but for some reason BIOS is not booting from CD-ROM or USB, so I will make SYSLINUX to boot to the ubuntu ISO in my Download folder, there is any command to append to the boot process so that the ISO is copyed completely to RAM?
[12:16] <ClientAlive> I think I need to make sure I have the repos installed that are on that other machine. What's that file location and the command to install a repo on the other machine?

[12:17] <qasim> hi... does anyone nuxninja?... he was here like 4 or 5 hours ago....
[12:19] <Ben64> qasim: Jan 28 2013 03:45:23 *	nuxninja (~corenot@27.4.112.94) has left #ubuntu ("Ex-Chat")
[12:21] <qasim> Ben64,  thx for informing... i just wanted to let him know the link that he gave worked..... i dont login here often but its a sort of obligation on me to tell the outcome...
[12:21] <ThinkT510> !yay | qasim
[12:21] <ubottu> qasim: Glad you made it! :-)
[12:21] <Ben64> qasim: well thats not really the best way to install nvidia
[12:21] <Ben64> but if it worked it worked
[12:22] <qasim> Ben64,  i dont know but my boats are floating :P so yay
[12:22] <Ben64> it might break during an upgrade
[12:23] <qasim> actually i dint istall nvidea from there :P
[12:23] <Ben64> you said you did
[12:23] <qasim> i just installed xorg edgers :P
[12:23] <ClientAlive> isn't there some file that shows what repositories are installed?
[12:23] <qasim> Ben64, i said the link that he gave me worked
[12:24] <Ben64> qasim: the link said to download and run a file
[12:24] <Ben64> the file gets nvidia drivers from the website and runs it that way
[12:24] <Ben64> ClientAlive: /etc/apt/sources.list and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*
[12:24] <qasim> after adding the ppa i just updated it...it installed updates of 100 mbs and now its working
[12:24] <Ben64> you didn't do the other steps?
[12:25] <qasim> nopes
[12:25] <ClientAlive> Ben64: yup. thx
[12:25] <Ben64> qasim: and you're definitely using nvidia driver?
[12:25] <qasim> no i think im still using xorg
[12:25] <qasim> let me confirm
[12:25] <ThinkT510> qasim: beware of upgrading that system in the future, ppas are notorious for package breakages
[12:26] <Ben64> yeah not sure why someone would recommend that method
[12:26] <Ben64> the normal ubuntu repository has nvidia 310 driver
[12:26] <qasim> ThinkT510, thx for the heads up...i would keep in mind
[12:26] <hillary> how do i locate " 1 not fully installed or remove" package in ubuntu 12.04
[12:27] <qasim> Ben64,  actually i had installed the nvidea normal way but it dint work
[12:27] <ThinkT510> hillary: what is the output of: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade?
[12:28] <qasim> Ben64,  how to check if its x server or nvidea running currently on  my OS?
[12:28] <Ben64> qasim: what is the output of "sudo lshw -c video | grep -i driver"
[12:29] <qasim> let me check Ben64
[12:29] <ThinkT510> qasim: if you have a gui then X server is running, nvidia is just the graphics driver
[12:29] <qasim> okay
[12:30] <ThinkT510> qasim: if you want to see what is in use lsmod will show you the kernel modules loaded
[12:30] <qasim> Ben64,  configuration: driver=nouveau latency=0
[12:31] <Ben64> then you're not using nvidia
[12:31] <ThinkT510> qasim: then you are using the open source nouveau driver
[12:31] <qasim> kool
[12:31] <Ben64> you don't want to use nvidia?
[12:31] <qasim> ThinkT510 and Ben64  i was right i dint install the nvidea actually;p
[12:31] <ThinkT510> qasim: why did you install the edgers ppa then?
[12:31] <qasim> nah Ben64  not at all
[12:32] <Ben64> then why did you ask about it ...
[12:32] <qasim> its beeeeeeeeeen so very hard for me to resolve this effing blu ray problem
[12:32] <qasim> lolll
[12:33] <ThinkT510> qasim: what does bluray have to do with xorg?
[12:33] <lapdis> What is the easiest way to make a process keep running when I log out of the system?
[12:33] <Ben64> lapdis: screen
[12:33] <qasim> ThinkT510,  i was unable to play blue ray format videos properly
[12:33] <hillary> sudo apt-get update is "http://paste.ubuntu.com/1581052/"
[12:33] <qasim> nux asked me to install nvidea
[12:34] <qasim> and he gave me the link
[12:34] <qasim> from there i just installed xorg edgers
[12:34] <qasim> and updated the system
[12:34] <ThinkT510> qasim: and you are not running nvidia, you are running nouveau, so why are you using xorg-edgers if you don't plan on using nvidia?
[12:35] <qasim> ThinkT510, i know i wont be making any sense but snce im using this linux..wonders happen
[12:35] <qasim> lol
[12:35] <ThinkT510> qasim: what was wrong with the previous xorg so that you needed xorg-edgers?
[12:36] <hillary> sudo apt-get update is "http://paste.ubuntu.com/1581052/"

[12:36] <qasim> ThinkT510,  but now all sort of videos  are working properly
[12:37] <ThinkT510> qasim: ok
[12:37] <Ben64> Eagleman: you could query a server and have it report back to you
[12:37] <ThinkT510> Eagleman: iwconfig

[12:51] <wasanzy> histo: buntu 10.10 \n \l
[12:52] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: 10.10 is no longer supported
[12:52] <hillary>  ok ok understood
[12:52] <histo> wasanzy: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[12:53] <histo> wasanzy: when 10.10 went end of life the repos went down.
[12:53] <wasanzy> ok
[12:53] <wasanzy> but I think that is a bad thing
[12:54] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: the support periods are clearly defined
[12:54] <histo> !release | wasanzy
[12:54] <ubottu> wasanzy: Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 18 months to 5 years. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
[12:54] <histo> wasanzy: So they should support ever version ever made?
[12:54] <histo> wasanzy: sorry every version ever made?  That would be rather difficult
[12:55] <histo> wasanzy: if you want longer term support stick to LTS releases like 10.04 or 12.04 etc...
[12:56] <test4> hi guys
[12:56] <test4> i have a problem with ubuntu on acer aspire laptop...
[12:56] <histo> !details | test4
[12:56] <ubottu> test4: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[12:56] <test4> Keyboard buttons wont work unless i hold them down, when i press one time it only makes sound.
[12:57] <wasanzy> so now I have to upgrade?
[12:57] <histo> test4: Does this happen in every application?
[12:58] <test4> histo terminal and keyboard settings test area.
[12:58] <MonkeyDust> wasanzy  yes
[12:58] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, only if you want updates
[12:58] <test4> and in menu i press buttons it makes sound..
[12:58] <test4> so yes histo
[12:58] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: a fresh install would be best
[12:58] <histo> wasanzy: You don't have to do anything
[12:58] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, the distro will continue to work but ...
[12:59] <wasanzy> the problem first came when I was trying to install php: apt-get install php5
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[12:59] <wasanzy> is not really about update
[12:59] <MonkeyDust> wasanzy  newer version is adviced, but not requiered - you simply won't get any upates
[12:59] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: then use a supported release
[12:59] <histo> wasanzy: you can move your home to a sperate partition. And then just reinstall /  and all your settings and stuff would be saved
[12:59] <test4> histo:  its my friends laptop he just showed me the problem.. i dno what has he done.. i hear it just happened.. is it possible something is physicaly wrong with the keyboard? or.. some butons
[12:59] <histo> !seperatehome | wasanzy
[12:59] <histo> !separatehome | wasanzy

[13:00] <wasanzy> ok, thank you

[13:01] <_Rocky_> evince pdf typesetting is bad. some characters seem to touch others or overlap. the same pdf looks good when I open it in adobe reader on windows
[13:01] <histo> _Rocky_: Try a different pdf reader in linux then
[13:02] <MonkeyDust> !pdf | _Rocky_
[13:02] <ubottu> _Rocky_: The Portable Document Format is created by Adobe; PDF files are viewable in Ubuntu with Xpdf, Okular, Evince and also Adobe Reader (free download, but closed source)
[13:03] <bogi-> _Rocky_,  maybe problem is in used fonts in document...
[13:03] <histo> test4: or try hitting ctrl+alt+f1 and testing keyboard in cli.  Or you can boot in single user mode and check kb also. Maybe it's just a probelm with a setting in X.  If it still works in cli or su then I would start checking in his home .gconf or some settings files.
[13:03] <histo> test4: You could create another user and confirm that it's only his user experiencing the issue.
[13:04] <Mrokii> Does anybody know why I get the following error message in weechat (possibly in other apps as well, don't know): dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoServer: Failed to connect to socket /tmp/dbus-6qIqQMHf2j:

[13:04] <Mrokii> Connection refused
[13:05] <MonkeyDust> hillary  what ThinkT510 says: the PPAs are most probably the wrong-doers
[13:06] <test4> histo
[13:07] <test4> ctrl alt f1
[13:07] <test4> it works there
[13:07] <hillary> ThinkT510:  what do i do
[13:07] <ThinkT510> hillary: get rid of them
[13:07] <bogi-> Does somebody know to fix problems with pydoc -k(ubuntu 12.04) ???I got traceback error when search ?

[13:07] <ubottu> hillary: To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[13:08] <test4> histo so how can i fix it?
[13:08] <histo> test4: okay so now try and eliminate it being a setting. Create  new user and test i there.
[13:08] <ThinkT510> hillary: i don't use ppas and discourage their use, they are likely the cause of 99% of all dependency issues
[13:08] <wasanzy> is 11.04 forever supported?

[13:09] <ubottu> wasanzy,: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[13:09] <bogi-> cfhowlett, please dont troll
[13:09] <hillary> ThinkT510: let me try follow your steps to remove them

[13:09] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: are you just afraid of using unity? you don't have to use unity, there are other choices
[13:10] <bogi-> cfhowlett, ...abou supporting particular version till end of world
[13:10] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, if you want to use an ubuntu with a long support window, install LTS only

[13:10] <wasanzy> ok, I have to approval from my boss to upgrade the server now
[13:10] <histo> test4: no then it's a problem in X

[13:17] <Guest85548> sorry to interupt, but how do i go about getting help?
[13:17] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: clean install a supported version
[13:17] <histo> test4: How badly does he want his customizations that's he's made?
[13:17] <sara_ubuntu>  histo can any1 guide me how to troubleshoot  : sda2 linux installation not show in grub , phttp://paste.ubuntu.com/1569356/  , grub-update doesn't help
[13:17] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, clean install is your best option.
[13:17] <sara_ubuntu>  histo can any1 guide me how to troubleshoot  : sda2 linux installation not show in grub , http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569356/  , grub-update doesn't help
[13:17] <test4> histo im sure he could do without it.. if theres no other simple way to fix it.
[13:17] <histo> wasanzy: I would move your home to separate partition then do a clean install of /
[13:17] <wasanzy> I only have ssh access to the server being hosted some where else
[13:18] <_Rocky_> wasanzy: +1 for clean install after data backup. upgrade might cause problems
[13:18] <histo> wasanzy: oh boy
[13:18] <histo> wasanzy: Why haven't you updated it?
[13:18] <Matt__> Running Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS from USB and running installation and I keep getting stuck on "Where are you?" after it says it's finished copying files. The progress bar goes away and the cursor goes to the round loading one and it sticks here indefinately. Any solutions?
=== dk_ is now known as Guest29043
[13:19] <histo> wasanzy: Also why are you running 10.10 on a server instead of 10.04 or 12.04?
[13:19] <sara_ubuntu> Matt__ have u tried with "try without installing" does it work on ur hardware?
[13:19] <antonio_> does anyone know how to install adobe air on 12.10?
[13:19] <histo> !alternate | Matt__
[13:19] <ubottu> Matt__: The alternate CD has been discontinued for the main Ubuntu distro, please use and report any bugs in the !LiveCD
[13:19] <histo> Matt__: I would check your cd for errors
[13:19] <wasanzy> histo: I don't manage that server and it was just now that I was ask to install php and mysql before I realized the version
[13:20] <test4> so histo what shall i do?
[13:20] <Matt__> It has worked before on the same USB install and I've also reinstalled on the USB. And yes, I've run it on the same PC just recently but i had to format. (Installing alongside Windows 7 btw but it doesn't want to work on any of my 3 HDDs)
[13:20] <wasanzy> I don't know if it is a server version or desktop though, but it looks like there are some other applications on it
[13:20] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: you should chastise whoever did manage that server
=== magentar_ is now known as magentar
[13:21] <wasanzy> ThinkT510: you are right, but right now I don't even knows who manages it may be my boss but well he only said, install php and mysql
[13:21] <Guest29043> *** I'm trying to start fresh with Ubuntu, but don't know how to wipe HDD clean. Can someone help?
[13:21] <Matt__> And I'm also on 'try without install', I have the install running in the background trying again but it stuck so I came here
[13:21] <wasanzy> so what option do I have left?
[13:21] <cfhowlett> Guest29043, just format the hdd when you install
[13:22] <Guest29043> i installed it using the web sintaller
[13:22] <Guest29043> i didnt see an option.. i missed it?
[13:22] <cfhowlett> Guest29043, web installer?  in ubuntu?
[13:22] <histo> test4: I don't know of a simple way perhaps someone else will?  But I would start ls -h  in his home and moving some of the .gnomexxxx directories to .gnomeback and .gconf etc...
[13:22] <wasanzy> and how do I check if the machine is actually running ubuntu server version? command I mean
[13:22] <_Rocky_> Guest29043: You will have an option called "Use entire hard disk" or something like that
[13:22] <histo> test4: I would start with .gconf
[13:22] <histo> wasanzy: uname -a
[13:22] <wasanzy> oh right
[13:23] <cfhowlett> Guest29043, you mean the wubi/windows installer?
[13:23] <wasanzy> Linux accounts 2.6.35.4-rscloud #8 SMP Mon Sep 20 15:54:33 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux
[13:23] <Guest29043> yup
[13:23] <wasanzy> I think is a cloud server
[13:23] <Guest29043> so go back to windows and 'use entire disk'?
[13:24] <cfhowlett> Guest29043, fyi, wubi is designed for testing ubuntu, not long term installation.  If you want windows and ubuntu, I'd urge you to consider virtualbox or dual booting.
[13:24] <MonkeyDust> wasanzy  lsb_release -sd <-- does it say "server" ?
[13:24] <test4> histo i got it..near clock program was running where i can set universal access settings or something. dno what it is in english exactly.
[13:24] <Guest29043> k, i have a portable drive, i can use that instead of a usb stick right?
[13:25] <wasanzy> Ubuntu 10.10
[13:25] <Matt__> Guest29043: You could install it to a USB drive and choose 'Erase everything and install' in the installation
[13:25] <wasanzy> it didn't say server
[13:25] <histo> test4: Oh yeah disability settings duh sorry I dind't htink of that.
[13:25] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, yes but you'll have to be careful with configuration
[13:25] <test4> histo there was an option about pressing key have to hold it long to accept the key or something.. system is not in english..
[13:25] <histo> Guest29043: yes they are the same
[13:25] <Guest29043> boom, thanks everyone
[13:25] <test4> histo thanks for help anyways :)
[13:25] <wasanzy> in this case what option do I have in terms of upgrading?
[13:25] <histo> test4: np
[13:26] <histo> wasanzy: Who is administering the server?
[13:26] <butch128> I was (attempting) to install the latest Nvidia binary drivers.  Now logging into my machine as my main account (butch) just flickers and goes back to the original login screen.  Logging in as my Guest account works fine though.... Any idea what I can check?
[13:26] <histo> wasanzy: locally
[13:26] <wasanzy> I don't really know
[13:26] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, again, clean install to a supported version is your best bet ...
[13:26] <histo> wasanzy: okay well if you had to hard reset the system how would you accomplish that?
[13:26] <keelG> butch128: have you checked syslog?
[13:27] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: then you need to find out and get physical access to it
[13:27] <butch128> keelG - i will now, thanks
[13:27] <wasanzy> what is the physical access for? I mean what is the person suppose to do? clean install?
[13:28] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: to clean install yes
[13:28] <wasanzy> ok, let me discuss with my boss and see
[13:29] <histo> wasanzy: That's your best option you can try to upgrade but it's going to break and you will lose connection anyways.
[13:29] <histo> wasanzy: actually I don't even thing you can try to upgrade I belive 11.04 is EOL too let me check
=== Err404NotFound is now known as Error404NotFound

[13:29] <butch128> could that be it?
[13:30] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, 11.04 is EOL.  You're options are quite limited ...
[13:30] <histo> Matt__: yes I would check the USB for errors
[13:31] <sara_ubuntu> can any1 guide me how to troubleshoot  : sda2 linux installation not show in grub , http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569356/  , grub-update doesn't help
[13:31] <histo> Matt__: can you hit ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a console while it's stuck?
[13:31] <histo> !grub2 | sara_ubuntu
[13:31] <ubottu> sara_ubuntu: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[13:31] <wasanzy> the server I learn is a cloud server at Rackspace
[13:32] <Matt__> histo: Yes, I can use Ctrl+Alt+F1
[13:32] <ThinkT510> sara_ubuntu: while it might not help you i just wanted to say you might need to consider upgrading your 10.04 install, desktop support runs out in april
[13:32] <sara_ubuntu> thanks histo let me check
[13:32] <histo> Matt__: hit ctrl+alt+f4
[13:32] <wasanzy> so I guess you understand my situation now? at this point, I guess I only need to upgrade
[13:32] <wasanzy> running a command
[13:33] <nicestAdie> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO INCEST
[13:33] <Matt__> histo: Ok
[13:33] <sara_ubuntu> thanks ThinkT510 but i just want to be able to boot into it ... i just need some guidence how to add manually an os in grub2
[13:33] <histo> Matt__: any errors there?
[13:33] <ThinkT510> wasanzy: that will be a royal headache
[13:33] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, not like your system will spontaneously crash or anything but for any kind of support or to access updated features, yes an upgrade is required.
[13:33] <C-S-B> Since setting up ipv6, my static ipv4 address keeps renewing to a different IP to static assignment in network manager

[13:34] <wasanzy> ThinkT510: yes I agree with you but I don't have any other option left
[13:34] <histo> Matt__: ctrl+alt+F7 will get you back to GUI  can you use keyboard keys to navigate the options?
[13:34] <wasanzy> cfhowlett: yes upgrade is what I want to do, what how to go about it is my question now, just ssh access to the server
[13:34] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, take your time and access the resources at #ubuntu-server
[13:35] <Matt__> histo: Ctrl+Alt+F1 says something about 'Asking for cache data failed' a few times
[13:35] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, there is the PXE network install method but I have never done so can't advise
[13:35] <wasanzy> what will "do-release-upgrade"  upgrade to at this time?
[13:36] <iceroot> wasanzy: depending on your settings
[13:36] <Matt__> histo: I'm using Ctrl+Alt+F7 to get back to GUI, and yes, I'm using my keyboard and mouse here, but on the install window, it's just the O loading cursor
[13:36] <iceroot> wasanzy: nothing, to the next stable release, to the next lts-release
[13:36] <iceroot> wasanzy: to the next lts is only working when you are on an older lts
[13:36] <_Rocky_> wasanzy: Can you create a new empty partition?
[13:36] <histo> Matt__: did you select a timezone?
[13:37] <wasanzy> iceroot: what settings do I need? and where do I set it?
[13:37] <_Rocky_> wasanzy: If you can, you can do a fresh install on that partition, configure all your programs and boot into that
[13:37] <wasanzy> _Rocky_: No
[13:37] <hillary_> ThinkT510: how do i locate the ppa
[13:37] <Matt__> histo: It gets stuck right after selecting a time zone. The loading bar at the bottom goes away after 'Almost done copying files' and it gets stuck indefinately
[13:38] <Matt__> histo:I've left it there for hours and no progress
[13:38] <ThinkT510> hillary_: i don't use ppas so i can't help you sorry
[13:38] <wasanzy> _Rocky_: I can't create partition, what I only want right now is to be able to install mysql and php for them
[13:38] <MonkeyDust> hillary_  system settings, sources, other software
[13:39] <antonio_> does anyone know how to install adobe air on 12.10?
[13:39] <hillary_> MonkeyDust: ok let me try
[13:39] <lapdis> what is the best text-editor to use in a terminal if I am more used to notepad than vim?
[13:40] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, can I suggest something?  download the LTS 12.04, create a boot USB, reboot and go into the USB and figure out your stuff.  Then duplicate your configs and install on your actual machine
[13:40] <ThinkT510> cfhowlett: its a rackspace cloud server
[13:40] <histo> Matt__: Well what is the caching error?  Also maybe look around /tmp for an install log. I'm not sure where they are saving it now.
[13:40] <cfhowlett> ThinkT510, errr, disregard my suggestions
[13:40] <wasanzy> ok
[13:41] <_Rocky_> lapdis: I suggest emacs. small learning curve involved but it pays off really well.
[13:41] <wasanzy> this is really killing my brain
[13:41] <cfhowlett> wasanzy, it's solvable, man.  Just not easy.
[13:42] <wasanzy> cfhowlett: ok, but I don't know what settings I need before running the command : do-release-upgrade
[13:42] <wasanzy> and lsb_release -sd didn't see it is a server version too
[13:42] <Matt__> histo: I'm not sure, it just says that followed by 'assuming drive cache: Write through'
[13:42] <wasanzy> didn't say I mean
[13:43] <BluesKaj> Hi folks
[13:44] <_Rocky_> lapdis: infact, I am chatting with you through emacs :)
[13:44] <histo> Matt__: I would look for an install log. Or ask here.  What version of ubuntu are you installing by the way?
[13:44] <antonio_> does anyone know how to install adobe air on 12.10?
[13:44] <hillary_> MonkeyDust: After removing all the ppa i run update?
[13:44] <wasanzy> any more suggestion?

[14:34] <Matt__> histo: You still here?
[14:35] <ubuntu_demon> hey. I have a problem with an upgrade to ubuntu 12.04
[14:35] <ubuntu_demon> I pressed alt-tab during the upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04. Now I see my background but nothing else.  When I left for work this morning my disk was still working so I left it on.
[14:36] <intr0x80> I'm trying to get Grub2 to send its input/output to a serial port.  Does anyone have experience with this?  I have set GRUB_TERMINAL="serial" and have GRUB_SERIAL_COMMAND="serial..." in /etc/default/grub, but it still does not work. Any ideas?
[14:36] <ubuntu_demon> Is there a way to get the focus back to the upgrade process ?  I am able to go to a ctrl-alt-f1 and type commands.  I would rather not do a reboot.
[14:36] <MonkeyDust> ubuntu_demon  try alt-tab agzin
[14:36] <MonkeyDust> again*
[14:36] <wor> uhjuhhjuhuj
[14:36] <ubuntu_demon> MonkeyDust should alt-tab work in Ubuntu 12.04 ?
[14:37] <wor> fuck me now
[14:37] <MonkeyDust> ubuntu_demon  go ahead and try
[14:37] <ubuntu_demon> I will when I get back home tonight\
[14:38] <ubuntu_demon> i made this thread to describe my problem : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2109628
[14:38] <wor> dobrze
[14:38] <ubuntu_demon> I found multiple people who have had the same problem
[14:38] <Matt__> yes, Alt+Tab works in 12.04
[14:38] <mrrrr> u guys know a good way to check for activity on my network
[14:38] <ActionParsnip> mrrrr: ntop
[14:38] <ActionParsnip> mrrrr: or wireshark
[14:39] <ubuntu_demon> Would there be any other way to get back to the upgrade window if alt-tab doesnt work ?
[14:39] <ActionParsnip> ubuntu_demon: drag the others out of the way, maybe.
[14:39] <mrrrr> action ty
[14:40] <ActionParsnip> ubuntu_demon: if you hold ALT, you can drag from any point on the application windows
[14:40] <ubuntu_demon> ActionParsnip: I don't see any other windows. I only see my empty background. no butons/files/icons or whatever
[14:41] <ActionParsnip> ubuntu_demon: so the installer window has vanished?
[14:41] <ubuntu_demon> ActionParsnip: everything has vanished

[14:47] <ActionParsnip> ubuntu_demon: not sure dude, I always clean install so have no idea about upgrade issues
[14:47] <dr_willis> danman1453:  login to the console if you can . test with startx - see if it loads
[14:47] <ActionParsnip> ubuntu_demon: could run ccsm (I assume you are using compiz) and enable the ring switcher, may help#
[14:47] <danman1453> if i ctrl-alt-f1, i can login and start startx

[14:52] <thomas____> I ran that already a thousand times

[14:52] <ActionParsnip> thomas____: you can then run:  gksudo nvidia-settings    and set the res and refresh to something
[14:53] <thomas____> nvidia-settings says I(m not using the nvidia driver
[14:55] <danman1453> dr_willis, I also discovered I cant change permissions as sudo for my external usb hd.
[14:55] <thomas____> ActionParsnip: any more ideas?
[14:56] <danman1453> using chmod a+wxr /media/FreeAgent\ Drive, it appears to finish, but there are no changes
[14:57] <ActionParsnip> thomas____: i can give you mine, it may help. when the driver gets loaded, you can start tweaking

[14:59] <danman1453> ntfs i think.
[14:59] <danman1453> its a 1.5tb drive
[14:59] <dr_willis> danman1453:   you dont chown/chmod ntfs/cfat
[14:59] <dr_willis> cfat
[15:00] <danman1453> ok?
[15:00] <danman1453> is the ntfs access broken after my upgrade?
[15:00] <dr_willis> see if root user can access it and write to it
[15:00] <dr_willis> or mount it by hand with the ntfs-3g command
[15:01] <danman1453> i can cd into it with no problems from ssh as su
[15:01] <jhutchins_wk> danman1453: You set the permissions in the fstab entry that defines the mount.

[15:02] <ubottu> Gadget: Testing... Testing... 1. 2.. 3... ( by the way, remember that you can use /join #test )
[15:02] <danman1453> i just checked, i can make new directories on it too.
[15:02] <danman1453> fstab?
[15:02] <ThinkT510> !fstab | danman1453
[15:02] <ubottu> danman1453: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[15:03] <dr_willis> so its mounted and working. ;)
[15:03]  * dr_willis frogets what the original problem was..
[15:03] <danman1453> as superuser, yes
[15:03] <danman1453> there is no entry for it in /etc/fstab
[15:03] <dr_willis> its automounted by the fuse/udev stuff.
[15:04] <danman1453> ok
[15:04] <danman1453> so why are the permissions screwed after the update?
[15:04] <danman1453> does it have something to do with the broken boot sequence?

[15:09] <sgtkilljoy> Gadget: no, my i pm u?
[15:09] <sgtkilljoy> may*
[15:09] <danman1453> The fstab page says that external "flash" drive are usually mounted by gnome
[15:10] <Gadget> Sure! Thanks for the help.
[15:10] <danman1453> but can be mounted in fstab
[15:10] <Gadget> How do i make my text red?
[15:10] <Gadget> Sorry- never use IRC.
[15:10] <iceroot> danman1453: what "gnome" is doinig (its not gnome) is mounting the device when the user is loggeg in and the device is only mounted for that user
[15:11] <iceroot> danman1453: with fstab you are mounting something at boot for everyone and dont need a graphical login first
[15:12] <iceroot> Gadget: there is no reason to use colored text here

[15:50] <FlowRiser> hi
[15:50] <joseneto> sorry
[15:50] <tqrst> BluesKaj: and "startup" is a bit of a weird concept to me, as I rarely if ever log out
[15:50] <martti> joseneto: do you see it?
[15:51] <PokemonAcer> I actually  have 3 Ubuntu CD's I got for free
[15:51] <joseneto> yes
[15:51] <joseneto> marttu yes
[15:51] <martti> I guess it has device id 20 because you kept connecting and disconnecting it. smart idea.
[15:51] <joseneto> martti: but i dont know what to do from there
[15:52] <PokemonAcer> wait, I just looked at Ubuntu Server download, It actually sais that 12.04 will be supported longer than 12.10 WTF???
[15:52] <escott> !lts | PokemonAcer
[15:52] <ubottu> PokemonAcer: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)

[15:52] <BluesKaj> tqrst, hmm, that's wrong , run , dropbox status..  in the terminal
=== ubuntu is now known as Tefx
[15:52] <tqrst> BluesKaj: says it's running
[15:53] <tqrst> BluesKaj: (well, "Idle", but syncing works etc)
[15:53] <MonkeyDust> PokemonAcer  and mind your language
[15:53] <PokemonAcer> Sorry
[15:53] <craigbass1976> I don't know what the proper term is, may ungroup.  Is there a way to ungroup windows so that I can alt+tab quickly through multiple instances of the same app ?
[15:53] <PokemonAcer> But, for example when the new Ubuntu Comes out, 12.10 will be a LTS?
[15:54] <BluesKaj> tqrst, dropbox start ..what happens ?
[15:54] <MonkeyDust> PokemonAcer  no, 14.04 will be the next LTS

[15:55] <tqrst> BluesKaj: "dropbox stop" gives "Dropbox daemon stopped", then if I start again, I get "Starting dropbox...done!"
[15:55] <BluesKaj> tq did you go thru the link process/wizard after installing dropbox
[15:55] <BluesKaj> tqrst, ^
[15:55] <tqrst> BluesKaj: yes
[15:55] <tqrst> and dropbox *is* running
[15:55] <tqrst> it just dies once in a while
[15:56] <tqrst> everything else works fine
[15:56] <BluesKaj> tqrst, it looks like the startup script isn't starting in your panel altho your install seems ok ...strange
[15:58] <tyler_d> I just updated jdk and as a result cannot get skype to run
[15:59] <tyler_d> errors are http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1582484/
[15:59] <tqrst> BluesKaj: I don't understand what startup scripts have to do with a machine that's been up for 45 days
[15:59] <Ghost1227> I'm getting a "required virtual size does not fit available size" error when trying to use dual monitors. This configuration has always worked before under older versions of Ubuntu as well as older, and current, versions of other distros. Any thoughts on what has changed?
[16:00] <tqrst> BluesKaj: I sent dropbox an email - maybe they'll have ideas
=== Aurum is now known as tellytubby
[16:01] <tellytubby> hi guys
[16:01] <BluesKaj> tqrst, maybe a reboot once in while will reload some updated config files , seems a lot of apps need a reboot lately
[16:01] <rumpel> hello. I can't unmount my thumbdrive (ntfs partition). Lsof/fuser/dmesg shows nothing. Did sync, still no luck. Any ideas?
[16:02] <danman1453> my lightdm greeter on boot is failing according to lightdm.log
[16:02] <BluesKaj> the uptime pi**ing contest deosn't mean much anymore , tqrst
[16:03] <MonkeyDust> rumpel  type sudo blkid, with the thumbdrive plugged in, do you see it
[16:03] <danman1453> would that cause my boot screen to hand at checking battery status?
[16:03] <rumpel> MonkeyDust, I do. It's mounted properly.
=== tellytubby is now known as monkey_man
[16:04] <MonkeyDust> rumpel  misread it, you can't UNmount, sorry, try fuser -m [mount point]
[16:04] <zykotick9> BluesKaj: you're right, it's all about uptime % ;)
[16:05] <rumpel> MonkeyDust, nothing. I also tried lsof. Nothing shows up (also used sudo).
[16:05] <BluesKaj> zykotick9, I could care less about uptime ...I shut down almost every night
[16:08] <MonkeyDust> rumpel  and umout -f ?         (force)
[16:08] <MonkeyDust> rumpel  and umount -f ?         (force)
[16:08] <joseneto> martti didnt work, couldnt find anything helpfull
[16:08] <Pici> *umount
[16:08] <rumpel> MonkeyDust, still says that device is busy and unmounting is not possible.
[16:09] <MonkeyDust> rumpel  busy doing what, does it say? play music that's on it, for example?
[16:10] <rumpel> MonkeyDust, I wonder in which state the system will leave the filesystem if I shut down and not even using root permissions seems to allow unmounting it properly. :/
[16:10] <rumpel> MonkeyDust, that would probably show up using lsof/fuser i guess. Nothing seems to use the thumbdrive actually.
[16:12] <bipul> I am unable to connect Network Adaptor (Bridged) in my ubuntu 12.04.
[16:17] <Nvveen> Hi all, I'm having a very annoying problem. When I try to log into my account, unity doesn't load the panels, so my screen stays blank. Gnome 2 and cinnamon still work though. Anyone that can help me?
[16:17] <Nvveen> Failing that, could someone then tell me how to reset Unity
[16:18] <Nvveen> ?
[16:18] <joseneto>  martti didnt work, couldnt find anything helpfull
[16:18] <escott> Nvveen, dont use unity myself but i always thought it was unity --reset
[16:19] <Nvveen> escott, that's deprecated (gives me an error), and using dconf reset doesn't do anything either
[16:19] <Nvveen> I also tried apt-get install --reinstall unity-common unity unity-2d but that doesn't have an effect either

[16:26] <Nvveen> Oh yeah, after a few minutes of the blank screen a 'system program problem detected' message pops up, and if I report the error, it says /usr/bin/Xorg is the culprit, but the Xorg log files don't say anything

[16:38] <iceroot> i am getting tar: .: Cannot change mode to rwxr-xr-x: Operation not permitted  on a directory with rwxrwxrwx (tar will be run as others), why am i getting that error when tar is trying to extract files? others have rwx.
[16:38] <coz> omen__,  fios about 45 seconds
[16:39] <escott> iceroot, who will own the files extracted by tar
[16:40] <iceroot> escott: a user which is known on the system but is not the owner/group
[16:40] <Nvveen> Well, reinstalling the nvidia drivers didn't work, still no panels in Unity. Anyone able to help me?
[16:40] <escott> iceroot, but not the user who is doing the untarring?
[16:40] <tomemozok> Anyone knoes any channel for graphic problems?? Maybie i'll have more luck there...
[16:40] <iceroot> escott: yes the user hwich is executing tar

[16:40] <plover> I am having a very odd problem with the Ubuntu Studio desktop which I'm not even quite sure how to describe. When I boot, a previous session is being restored. However, the desktop is mostly nonfunctional.  No windows have a top title bar, and many of them have their menu bar glued into the desktop taskbar.  So far I haven't even been able to get a terminal window that I can use, but Firefox is running well enough that I can be here v
[16:41] <escott> iceroot, so "." is owned by alice:alice with permissions 777 and the files created by tar are owned by bob:bob who wants to change it to 755 but cannot
[16:41] <escott> ice, and the tar instance is running as bob:bob
[16:41] <iceroot> escott: correct
[16:41] <iceroot> escott: yes
[16:42] <escott> iceroot, and this is a standard POSIX compliant filesystem (ie not FAT/NTFS)
[16:42] <iceroot> escott: and if i get unix-permissions correct i am allowed because others have rwx
[16:42] <iceroot> escott: ext2
[16:42] <mathi> hey
[16:42] <escott> iceroot, weird. if you touch a file and then chmod it does that work
[16:43] <iceroot> escott: yes thats working fine, also a chmod 777 foobar is working fine but not the tar-command, also utime is failing because tar is unable to modify the time but that can be fixed with -m

[16:48] <escott> iceroot, in this case though there shouldn't be any chowning going on. tar should create the file with bob as the owner

[16:59] <rasp_pie> Hi. I have installed the OS (Ubuntu 12.04) of my NAS on an USB stick. But the stick is quite old and slow and it started to show file system errors. I would like to avoid re-installing the whole Ubuntu with all the configurations I made and instead just copy (dd) the whole stick to a new one. The question here is: This will probably copy the file system errors too, wouldn't it? Is there a...
[16:59] <rasp_pie> ...way to be sure I have a healthy system after copying it?
[16:59] <alimj> mathi: Why don't you use OpenSSH instead? You can change it via shell

[17:00] <Flannel> mathi: Use your favorite GUI FTP client, connect via SFTP, using your ssh login/pass.
[17:00] <iceroot> jrib: its the same as --touch, so its creating the file as it would be greatetd right now and is not using the old mtime from the files from the source

[17:02] <alimj> mathi: sudo passwd root
[17:02] <llutz> and it's a really bad idea to allow root access via ssh/sftp
[17:02] <mathi> alimj, but I need to to upload files in /etc/asterisk, right ? there is no alternatives
[17:02] <Flannel> mathi: You won't.  You'll have your user's permissions.  If you want to do admin things you'll need to set up root to (S)FTP, which isn't entirely a good idea.  Why not just modify the config files from within ssh?
[17:02] <alimj> mathi: It is dangerous --- be careful
[17:02] <escott> mathi, dont enable the root account. upload the files to your user account, ssh over and then sudo cp them to /etc
[17:02] <alimj> mathi: sudo passwd root  ----> enables root account
[17:02] <alimj> escott: Agree with you
[17:02] <jrib> iceroot: well the man page in 10.04 doesn't have the same "(default for ordinary users)" clause that it seems to have now with --no-same-owner.  Maybe behavior was different then.  Is there an issue with just passing --no-same-owner?
[17:02] <escott> alimj, please dont tell people in channel how to do that
[17:03] <MonkeyDust> mathi  and if you have to ask how to do it, then better don't do it
[17:03] <iceroot> jrib: i guess i will debug that later, i will reconnect to the system and will have a look what "tar --version" will tell me on that system
[17:03] <iceroot> jrib: maybe the rebuild tar from another source (non-gnu-version)

[17:07] <xangua> fedor: yes they do
[17:07] <fedor> for firefox it's working , but not for chromium :(

[17:08] <kunji> ...gnome-system-monitor is leaking memory, so is a conky script (because the writer does not understand Cairo), and maybe Xorg is leaking as well, and maybe flash but then again it just bloats whether it's leaking or not, so it's hard to tell.  The script I've fixed before, just need to dig out my fixed version and I guess I should get in touch with the original writer so the one on gnome-look can be fixed.  I guess I'm wondering if anyone

[17:09] <jrib> kunji: cool
[17:09] <fedor> as far as i understand it, there are some issues for chromium, and they are incorrigible
[17:09] <escott> fedor, there are some iptables based blacklists which would certainly block ads in chrome
[17:09] <alimj> Fedor: Then why don't you install Google Chrome from Google's official repositories?
[17:09] <fedor> <alimj> i can do that?

[17:12] <andrew_> Hi there, i have a usb DAC which isn't getting recognized as a digital out device (just analog stereo).  Any ideas how I can debug this?
[17:12] <alimj> fedor: I use it since I do website programming. I need one browser in logged in mode and one in anonymous mode
[17:12] <Mudboy> Does anyone know if a recent apache update changed the say the FollowSymLinks works?
[17:12] <jrib> HowdyDoody: sudo usually sanitizes the environment (see "man sudo")
[17:13] <fedor> alimj, still i cannot understand your point. If you have chrom installed what impedes you to use chrome's anonymous state?
[17:13] <escott> HowdyDoody, you may have some crazy interactions between gksudo and env. try putting the env after the gksudo
[17:14] <kunji> fedor: that he can't be be the user and an anonymous entity at the same time in the web app
[17:14] <alimj> fedor: I develop websites. WHile developing websites, you should log on to that site in admin mode. In the meantime, it is necessary to see the changes from others perspective.
[17:14] <escott> dandaman, you can just sudo cat /dev/sda | tee /dev/sdb &>/dev/null
[17:15] <escott> dandaman, alternately look at dd or ddrescue
[17:15] <fedor> i see now your point
[17:15] <dandaman> escott: that simple eh?
[17:15] <alimj> andrew: What is your DAC? Blackmagic-design? Avid?
[17:15] <qhartman> escott, what's the point of the tee in that command, seems extraneous.
[17:15] <escott> dandaman, i would always just reinstall, but if the disks are appropriately similar
[17:15] <escott> qhartman, what other way would work?
[17:16] <dandaman> escott: they arent, but i have settings that i want to preserve
[17:16] <dr_willis> qhartman:  sudo rights dont apply to redirection without the tee
[17:16] <zykotick9> qhartman: sudo doesn't pass through redirects
[17:16] <qhartman> ah, there ya go
[17:16] <HowdyDoody> escott: I thought I had tried that at least 3 different time.  Why not a 4th.   Wierd:  4th times a charm.   It works.   Not the way the examples shows, but I'm good to use it now.  THanks!

[17:19] <dandaman> orly?
[17:19] <dr_willis> escott:  i thought it looked weird
[17:19] <escott> dandaman, its an awful idea to be doign that
[17:19] <kunji> Hmm, maybe I should file a bug report?  gnome-system-monitor's RAM usage ballooned to 2.1 GB in 6 days.  Does anyone know what would be an expected amount for Xorg to use on a standard Unity install?  Mine at 1.9 GB right now.
[17:19] <escott> dandaman, you are going to mark the entire disk as dirty in the SSD firmware
[17:19] <escott> dandaman, and then have to trim it all out again
[17:19] <jhutchins_wk> escott: What's wrong with clonezilla?
[17:20] <atlef> sorry
[17:20] <escott> jhutchins_wk, nothing wrong with clonezilla. just low level copy in general to an SSD. i didnt realize dandaman was using an SSD
[17:20] <Nasser> hi
[17:20] <dandaman> escott: so plug in the ssd, boot up, then type in sudo cat /dev/sd<original HD ID> | sudo tee /dev/sd<new HD ID> &>/dev/null
[17:21] <dandaman> then set my bios to default to the ssd as the boot device?
[17:21] <dr_willis> kunji:  xorg itself is using 8% of my 512mb here.. but this is on a raspberry pi. ;)
[17:21] <escott> dandaman, you are better off partitioning and then copying files with a command like "sudo cp -aRx / /media/ssd_disk
[17:21] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: You're not booting to the original device are you?
[17:21] <escott> dandaman, i would not do that either
[17:21] <dandaman> jhutchins_wk: i am
[17:21] <escott> dandaman, i would not do any low level copy to the SSD
[17:21] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: Not a good idea.
=== ganja_man is now known as nuxninja
[17:22] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: You need to boot to a different medium - livd CD or USB.
[17:22] <dandaman> ok, i can handle that
[17:22] <dandaman> brb real quick
[17:22] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: THat will also avoid trying to copy pseudo filesystems like /dev and /proc
[17:23] <kunji> dr_willis: Hmm, yeah, I've got a pi, they're nice, mine isn't connected at the moment though.  Right, I'm thinking almost 2 Gigs is too much, but I'm not sure if other things run under that and are included or if that number is just Xorg itself.  I'm thinking it's leaking, maybe I'll leave it another day and check again.
[17:24] <dr_willis> kunji:  all through beta for 12.10 i had issues where xorg or compiz or somthing would go crazy and lagg the whole system. id restart the X server it would be great for a while... then it would happen again. but i never saw it using lots of ram.. just lots of cpu. ;)
[17:24] <kunji> jhutchins_wk: What's he trying to move?
[17:25] <jhutchins_wk> escott: A filesystem is a filesystem, but I certainly wouldn't use cat.  Partclone or dd should be fine.
[17:25] <MichaelP> What is nomodeset command in kernel of boot menu.. for radeon ?
[17:25] <escott> dandaman, boot the livecd. partition the new disk.  mount the old disk to /media/old_disk and the new ssd to /media/new_disk then sudo cp -aR /media/old_disk /media/new_disk. then chroot in and reinstall grub
[17:25] <jhutchins_wk> kunji: I think he's moving a debian install to a new disk.
[17:25] <kunji> dr_willis: Hmm, I do see a fair amount of cpu at times, but with 4 cores it doesn't seem to slow things down too badly and goes away after a while.
[17:25] <dr_willis> MichaelP:  nomodeset works for all the gpus.
[17:25] <escott> jhutchins_wk, there is no difference between dd and cat. and a filesystem is a filesystem, but an SSD disk is not a normal hard disk
[17:25] <jhutchins_wk> escott: I wouldn't use cp either, I'd use rsync.  Much more robust.
[17:26] <dandaman> a lot of opinions here :( what do i dew?
[17:26] <MichaelP> dr_willis, i know but different distro's do it different
[17:26] <jhutchins_wk> escott: An ssd presents itself as the same kind of device as a regular disk.  The differences are not exposed to the OS.
[17:26] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[17:26] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[17:26] <kunji> jhutchins_wk: Hmm, I think my preferred tool would be ddrescue then, does just copying the files work out for that?  If so, then rsync is the tool for the job after formatting with say gparted.
[17:27] <escott> jhutchins_wk, he is going to mark all the sectors dirty
[17:27] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: I would probably go with a file-level tool like rsync.
[17:27] <escott> jhutchins_wk, he also probably has an ext2 or ext3 partition that could be moved up to ext4 with extents
[17:27] <dandaman> my original hd is an ext4
[17:27] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: If the partitions are going to be identical, then using clonezilla is a good idea - it gives you the live CD and it doesn't waste time copying blank space.
[17:27] <escott> dandaman, you will degrade the performance of you SSD by doing a low level copy to the disk
[17:28] <Nasser> any suggestions for live widgets pals?
[17:28] <alimj> dandaman: I second escott...
[17:28] <dandaman> ok, so i need to rsync the files
[17:28] <jhutchins_wk> I would not recommend using ext4 unless you have a specific need for it.
[17:28] <dandaman> got it
[17:28] <dandaman> jhutchins_wk: what should i make my new ssd then?
[17:28] <dandaman> ext3?
[17:28] <alimj> dandaman: Please do not forget to set the boot partition active...
[17:29] <dandaman> alimj: how do i do that?
[17:29] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: rsync -av /input /output - no need for compression (z) since you're not going through any transport.
[17:29] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: Yeah, I'd use ext3.
[17:29] <alimj> dandaman: With fdisk or gparted
[17:29] <alimj> dandaman: ext3 should be OK. You will not require too much journaling....
[17:30] <dandaman> god damn i dont know how to reinstall grub either :(
[17:30] <atlef> !grub

[17:30] <kunji> Hmm, what's with the bias against ext4?
[17:30] <escott> dandaman, you will want the following mount options for an SSD noatime,nodiratime,discard
[17:30] <alimj> kunji: He is using SSD not HDD
[17:31] <escott> alimj, you can use ext4 without journaling
[17:31] <alimj> escott: I also love backward compatibility :P
[17:32] <kunji> alimj: Right, mind explaining though?  Or citing?  You can even use HDD without journaling, is your point just that because the writes are fast that you shouldn't bother with journaling?
[17:32] <jhutchins_wk> Why would you not use journaling on a modern system?
[17:32] <escott> kunji, the idea is that it amplifies the number of writes
[17:32] <alimj> kunji: Writing too much information to SSDs will age them. There is a limit for that.
[17:33] <jhutchins_wk> escott: Actually, the opposite is true, journalling reduces writes.
[17:33] <dr_willis> i still have to wonder at how long the lifespan of these sdds are....
[17:33] <escott> jhutchins_wk, i didnt say i agreed with it
[17:33] <escott> dandaman, welcome to the world of cutting edge technology. a lot of these decisions will depend on how long you expect your SSD to last

[17:34] <escott> dandaman, i view SSD as a rather disposable product... if it lasts for 2 years then ill be 2 years closer to being able to buy a robust and well functioning SSD
[17:34] <dandaman> escott: :(
[17:34] <kunji> I would expect that their lifetimes are not all that different from HDDs.
[17:34] <alimj> jhutchins_wk: Almost agree with you...
[17:34] <dr_willis> every thing is disosable these days...
[17:34] <kunji> escott: I've already had one last 2 years
[17:34] <dandaman> kunji: shorter but more predictable
[17:35] <jhutchins_wk> dandaman: I would treat it like a normal disk.  Make sure you have good backups; if you're interested in optimizing it research the actual hardware you have - don't go by advice on devices that came out two or three years ago.
[17:35] <alimj> dandaman: You should not be too much worried. Just partition the SSD similar to HDD, then format using ext3. finally use rsync or cp to copy files & update grub
[17:35] <escott> dandaman, i think you will find general agreement on (a) not doing a low level copy (b) setting noatime,nodiratime,discard beyond that to things like journaling vs other filesystems... i dont know

[17:37] <escott> dandaman, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_ChRoot ignore the bit about mdadm
[17:37] <escott> dandaman, you will also have to fix up the /etc/fstab because its a new partition with new UUIDs

[17:38] <alimj> kunji: It is already explained that we want to avoid pseudo files
[17:38] <escott> kunji, cannot get a clean snapshot read of a running filesystem. less important since he is not doing a low level copy
[17:38] <escott> alimj, those can be avoided with cp -aRx
[17:38] <kunji> alimj: Sorry, I thought you were referring to the Grub part
[17:39] <escott> dandaman, the livecd is somewhat optional but i would do it anyways
[17:39] <alimj> escott: yes, but if he has /home (or /dev) on another partition

I installed flup and etc packages but in centos I had to set enforce 0 for selinux which  made a problems.... but in ubuntu I have a problem all the time ...
[17:43] <trism> riegersn: ahh, in 12.10, an item won't be removed from the messaging menu until an up unregisters it or the .desktop file disappears...in this case xchat-indicator only ships the shared lib so when you remove it, I imagine it used the xchat .desktop file
[17:43] <trism> riegersn: might try removing/reinstalling xchat

[17:54] <hrundi_bakshi> hi nitesh
[17:54] <josesierra> gnome-shell process is chewing up ram like crazy.  It's up to 221.6mb.  If I pull up Chrome (another memory hog) it chews up 80% of my available ram.  Is this normal...?
[17:54] <hrundi_bakshi> hi Nitesh
[17:55] <Nitesh> kahase ho tum ?
[17:55] <heywood> trying to monitor a process that occasionally runs away and pegs the CPU. am i better off running a watchdog script with a while / sleep loop in the background, or making it a one-off and running it from cron?
[17:56] <hrundi_bakshi> try #bakchodi Nitesh
[17:56] <milind> I have two VM's running ssh in the same host, I want to be able to ssh between the VM's. I am currently running NAT on both but cant seem to ssh, do I need a bridged connection or internal network connection to achieve this? I am using Virtual Box btw
[17:56] <hrundi_bakshi> hi milind
[17:57] <escott> heywood, there are watchdog functionalities in the kernel. you can throttle the process or kill it if it gets away
[17:57] <dr_willis> milind:  what vm are you using?
[17:57] <escott> milind, a NAT will be opaque to computers on the WAN side of the NAT
[17:57] <Nitesh> tumako kya hua ?
[17:57] <dr_willis> milind:  ahh vbox. - it has settings for networking that put them all on the same ip as the local lan
[17:57] <kunji> milind: I think it depends what sort of connection is set up for them in the VM, i.e. is it already bridged etc...
[17:58] <hrundi_bakshi> kuch nahi Nitesh but try #bakchodi for all harami's
[17:58] <dr_willis> milind:  if your host is 192.168.1.100  the vbox machines can have an ip of 192.168.1.101 and so forth. if you set it right
[17:58] <Nitesh> hi....
[17:58] <heywood> escott: what i want to do is kill and restart (via sudo, BTW) when the CPU load exceeds some threshold. is there a kernel watchdog that can do that?
[17:58] <dr_willis> milind:  theres like 3 options for networking.  one does it this way where they all appear on the lan.
[17:58] <JuJuBee> I just installed ubuntu 12.10 from USB to an HP Compaq 8300 and it won't boot from the HD.  Same installer on another HP COmpaq 8300 worked fine.  Suggestions?
[17:59] <Nitesh> tumara naam kya he ?
[17:59] <keelG> josesierra: I use the unity shell, however 220mb doesn't sound too crazy - and I don't know what your total amount of memory is. But my ff quickly takes up a few 100mbs as well :)
[17:59] <jhutchins_wk> JuJuBee: What happens when you try to boot?
[17:59] <escott> heywood, try cpulimit
[17:59] <hrundi_bakshi> Nitesh see pvt message
[18:00] <heywood> JuJuBee: can you boot from a liveCD (or the USB), mount the HD, and verify that the install is actually there on the HD?
[18:00] <Nitesh> haa..

[18:01] <JuJuBee> heywood: let me check...
[18:02] <JuJuBee> heywood: seems to be all there
[18:02] <ioria> i run lubuntu 12.04 (but installed gnome also) and  i cannot open file url in gnome- terminal (URL=file:///), but i can in gnome session. help please
[18:03] <heywood> escott: looking at manpage now. says it handles runaway processes by "by sending it SIGSTOP and SIGCONT signals". is that equivalent to killall -HUP followed by a restart?
[18:03] <JuJuBee> jhutchins_wk: I also have an  ltsp server running so the machine seems to skip the HD and go to PXE boot.  I checked the bios and have the hd before netboot and even tried using boot menu to select Sata 0.  I get no errors, just goes to PXE
[18:03] <escott> heywood, no
[18:03] <escott> heywood, thats like ctrl-z; fg in the shell
[18:04] <escott> heywood, but you might be able to get it to send a different signal
[18:04] <heywood> JuJuBee: try booting and getting to the BIOS config, before grub (pre-boot kernel selector) comes up. usually it's something like holding F1 down during boot.
[18:05] <heywood> JuJuBee: in there, look for a menu that specifies boot order. check that order to make sure it's sane.
[18:05] <JuJuBee> heywood: already looked at boot menu
[18:05] <JuJuBee> fine
[18:05] <heywood> escott: ok, i'll have to apt-get the source for it and hack away at that. thanks for the pointer.
[18:05] <heywood> JuJuBee: ok, so if the boot menu is sane, what happens when you remove the USB install stick and reboot?
=== Wug[Hyperspace] is now known as Wug
[18:06] <JuJuBee> heywood: it ends up booting to PXE
[18:06] <ikonia> JuJuBee: you will find grub installed to the usb, rather than the hard disk
[18:06] <JuJuBee> Like it cannot find a bootable HS
[18:06] <ikonia> JuJuBee: that is the most common reason for the situation you are in
[18:07] <JuJuBee> ikonia: Ah, let me check that  possibility  I forgot that was an issue
[18:07] <ikonia>  /dev/sda will be your usb disk and I'd bet grub went to that disk

[18:23] <kunji> JuJuBee: There are various ways to fix grub, which one is best would depend on the situation.

[18:28] <hillary> zykotick9: yap that is the thing help
[18:28] <iceroot> jhutchins_wk: and can you tell me what is in line 2 of /etc/environment which is causing the error?
[18:28] <zykotick9> hillary: anything installed in /opt is a non-ubuntu package.  and mono is a cancer.  good luck.  don't reply to me further.
[18:28] <kunji> iceroot: I think he meant the part about informing how to pastebin, was maybe a bit pedantic.
[18:29] <iceroot> kunji: ah ok
[18:29] <hillary> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1583137/
[18:29] <iceroot> hillary: that is not what i was asking for
[18:29] <iceroot> hillary: please paste the output of "cat /etc/environment" to pastebin
[18:30] <jhutchins_wk> hillary: It looks like the configuration script for the mono package didn't suceed, and that's causing the apt system to hang.  I think I would try removing mono, possibly just using dpkg instead of one of the wrappers, then do aptitude -f install to see if it recovers.
[18:30] <zykotick9> jhutchins_wk: i highly doubt a "package" installed to /opt
[18:30] <iceroot> jhutchins_wk: its not a package-problem
[18:31] <iceroot> jhutchins_wk: its a problem in /etc/environment
[18:31] <ddosantos> hello, first time around
[18:31] <hillary> iceroot: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1583152/
[18:31] <iceroot> jhutchins_wk: there is some mono config and the package which dpkg is trying to configure is parsing /etc/environment
[18:31] <ddosantos> if I may...is this the correct place to ask doubts?
[18:31] <DarkSim> When installing Ubuntu I choose logical type of partition, right?
[18:31] <jhutchins_wk> iceroot: I shall entrust hillary to your superior knowledge of mono - thanks.
[18:32] <iceroot> hillary: gksudo gedit /etc/environment    and then remove the line with :/opt/mono-2.11/bin
[18:32] <kunji> ddosantos: I don't know, what do you mean by doubts?
[18:32] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: This is a place to ask questions regarding ubuntu support.
[18:32] <iceroot> jhutchins_wk:  its knowlegde of "she executed a PATH command wrong or edited /etc/environment" by hand. its nothing mono specific
[18:32] <ddosantos> well, I was trying to mount an external HD so I can share it with samba
[18:33] <ddosantos> I edited /etc/fstab but it does not mount where I told it
[18:33] <kunji> DarkSim: Doesn't have to be logical, but I would typically.
[18:33] <iceroot> hillary: just remove the line, save the file and everything should be fine
[18:33] <DarkSim> I keep forgetting the settings :P
[18:33] <Tost> I'm trying to use this command to create a file and add contents to it > "echo "The text you want added to a new file" >> the_file_name" but I keep getting 'permission denied' and I don't know why.  Any advice you can offer a linux noob?
[18:33] <hillary> iceroot: i have removed
[18:33] <kunji> ddosantos: Does it mount someplace else?
[18:33] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Paste the fstab to  http://paste.ubuntu.com
[18:33] <ddosantos> yeah, it actually does
[18:33] <DarkSim> Logical, beginning of space and / mount
[18:34] <ddosantos> paste.ubuntu.com, got it
[18:34] <iceroot> hillary: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade       the upgrade should be working now
[18:34] <jhutchins_wk> DarkSim: Usually you only need a logical partition if you go beyond four partitions.
[18:35] <jhutchins_wk> DarkSim In which case you go three physical, one extended, and the rest logical (which are within the extended).
[18:35] <ddosantos> you can have a look at it at http://paste.ubuntu.com/1583169/
[18:35] <escott> Tost, who owns "the_file_name"
[18:35] <kunji> DarkSim: Logical is the type of partition, there are two kinds, Logical and Physical.  You get 4 physical ones (unless using GPT), if you need more partitions than that, then you have to use logical ones.
[18:36] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Does /media/externo exist?
[18:36] <ddosantos> yes it does
[18:36] <ddosantos> I also set the permisions to 777 just in case
[18:36] <kunji> DarkSim: That type being different from the other field that is often called type (the filesystem type), which is what sort of thing the partition will be used for, aka filesystem type, like swap, ext4, etc..
[18:36] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Where does the device mount instead?
[18:37] <iceroot> hillary: working?

[18:38] <kunji> ddosantos: Have you rebooted?  Or are you testing with the mount command?  Is the drive still listed in mtab?
[18:38] <escott> Tost, if the file already exists someone else may own it and you might not be able to write to it. if its not your directory you might not be able to create files
[18:38] <zykotick9> Tost: fyi (not directly related to your permission issue but) > is redirect to file, while >> is append to file.
[18:38] <escott> !permissions | Tost
[18:38] <ubottu> Tost: An explanation of what file permissions are and how they can be manipulated can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
[18:38] <ddosantos> yes I tried a reboot a while ago
[18:39] <ddosantos> I am not using the mount command as it mounts itself alone
[18:39] <ddosantos> when switched on
[18:39] <hillary> Iceroot: a minute i will let you know.
[18:39] <zykotick9> Tost: fyi#2 and easy way to create a file is "touch filename"
[18:40] <kunji> ddosantos: Just checking, because sometimes people test after making the change in fstab by using mount -a I think it is to mount everything listed in the fstab.
[18:40] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: You do not have the auto command in fstab, therefore it will not mount at boot as a part of the normal filesystem.  It is probably being mounted by udev/fuse.  You should doublecheck the UUID.
[18:40] <lolcat> What is the ubuntu repo for chrome, and how do I add it? My browers is stone dead
[18:40] <ddosantos> what do you mean with doublecheck? do you there might be any typo¿
[18:40] <ddosantos> do you think*
[18:40] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Yes, it's possible.
[18:40] <Tost> thank you for the replies! ubottu, I will check the site..also, why can't I create files in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory within the file system GUI?
[18:41] <iceroot> Tost: because the directory belongs to root
[18:41] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: mount -a or mount /media/externo should mount it properly.
[18:41] <zykotick9> Tost: anything outside of /home and /tmp are going to require elevated (ie root) permission probably.
[18:41] <iceroot> Tost: and you are not root, so you are not allowed to write in that directory
[18:41] <ioria> i run lubuntu 12.04 (but installed also gnome) and  i cannot open file url in gnome-terminal (URL=file:///), but i can in gnome session. help please. tx

[18:41] <Phonequer> How to read dependencies of a package?
[18:42] <ddosantos> should I umount /media/Iomega\ HDD before?
[18:42] <kunji> jhutchins_wk: Hmm?  What is this auto command?
[18:42] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Actually, my mistake, the drive should mount at boot.
[18:42] <ddosantos> yes, I saw a message at boot
[18:42] <zykotick9> Phonequer: "apt-cache depends foo" or "apt-cache rdepends foo" for the reverse version
[18:42] <ddosantos> I hit S to ommit
[18:42] <jhutchins_wk> kunji: Different systems don't default to auto.  Ubuntu defaults and uses noauto for override.
[18:42] <ddosantos> because the hard drive was off at that moment
[18:43] <ddosantos> then when switched on I hoped it would mount at /media/externo
[18:43] <ddosantos> but it didn't
[18:43] <kunji> jhutchins_wk: ah, I see, I'll need to keep that in mind.
[18:43] <Phonequer> zykotick9: thanks
[18:43] <iceroot> Tost: why you need to put files in that directory?
[18:43] <josesierra> keelG: total amount of memory is only 3GB (max 4GB, it's an older system, lol).  But if you're telling me that kind of mem usage is normal, I'll definitely take your word for it!  Thank you (again!!!)
[18:43] <iceroot> Tost: normally you will manage your repos using the software-center
[18:44] <kunji> ddosantos: Hmm, check again that the UUID is right, that the drive is NTFS, and that /media/externo exists with the correct permissions.  I'm not sure what else to look at, I've never actually had a problem with fstab.

[18:47] <iceroot> hillary: you are welcome
[18:47] <ddosantos> aren't they? The other partition with ntfs is being correctly mounted at /media/partiwin
[18:48] <kunji> ddosantos: In mine I do not have quotes around them, and you don't for your first 2 partitions.
[18:48] <iceroot> Tost: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
[18:48] <iceroot> Tost: edit that file with the repos you need
[18:48] <iceroot> Tost: no need to create files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
[18:48] <Tost> iceroot, ok, i was just following the directions but I'll do what you say..
[18:48] <iceroot> Tost: and please remeber, such repos are not supported here, we only support installations with official ubuntu repos
[18:49] <ddosantos> kunji: I will try without them, but it makes me doubt as the sda1 is being mounted at /media/partiwin as expected, and that line does have quotes
[18:49] <kunji> ddosantos: Also I have no - in utf-8, I have utf8.  Maybe the parser is breaking on that right before the last drive?  Try changing those 2 things and give it a go
[18:49] <iceroot> Tost: and dont!!!! put in the squeeze parts
[18:49] <iceroot> Tost: at "installing the jdk"
[18:49] <iceroot> Tost: never put debian repos inside ubuntu
[18:49] <Tost> iceroot; forgive my ignoerance but what's a repo? and where would I go for help with such repos?
[18:49] <iceroot> !repo | Tost
[18:49] <ubottu> Tost: The packages in Ubuntu are divided into several sections. More information at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories and http://www.ubuntu.com/project/about-ubuntu/components - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecommendedSources for the recommended way to set up your repositories
[18:50] <Tex_Nick> !dns | Grandpa_smasher
[18:50] <ubottu> Grandpa_smasher: To set up a Domain Name Service see the !serverguide - https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/dns.html
[18:50] <kunji> ddosantos: hmm, also the utf part is lowercase in mine, I'll post what mine looks like real quick for you.
[18:50] <ddosantos> kunji: thank you for the help, that could be, but then why would the first partition be correctly mounted?
[18:50] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Quotes don't matter, I have both formats and it works either way.
[18:50] <iceroot> Tost: something like that is supported nowhere
[18:51] <iceroot> Tost:  deb http://debian.opennms.org stable main
[18:51] <iceroot>  deb-src http://debian.opennms.org stable main
[18:51] <kunji> ddosantos: If the parser is breaking on the utf portion it will already have the right info for the UUID and mount point of the 1st one and mount it fine, it just may not have the correct locale
[18:51] <iceroot> Tost: that are the only two lines which should be added to that file (still not supported) there other lines with squeeze and so on will break your system 100%
[18:52] <kunji> ddosantos: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1583223/
[18:52] <zykotick9> iceroot: i'd think testing or unstable would be a lot closer to any currently supported ubuntu version then squeeze (10.04 based).  Tost
[18:52] <JuJuBee> ikonia: SO I used the stick to reinstall on another computer and on boot it set the internal HD to sda and the usb stick to sdb.  So grub was set to the correct location.  Rebooted and got grub rescue
[18:52] <kunji> ddosantos: It's worth a shot, can't hurt to try it
[18:52] <iceroot> zykotick9: i bet it will still break the system
[18:52] <zykotick9> iceroot: agreed!
[18:53] <kunji> Tex_Nick: Thanks for helping Grandpa_smasher, I was preoccupied
[18:53] <iceroot> zykotick9: multiarch, systemd, udev, dbus, libc6 dependency-issues and so on
[18:53] <ddosantos> kunji: sure, I will do that. Can you please tell me if all your three mounted devices are external or internal?
[18:53] <iceroot> zykotick9: all the nice thinks which will happen by mixing repos :)
[18:53] <ddosantos> that could have something to do
[18:53] <zykotick9> iceroot: ;)
[18:53] <kunji> ddosantos: internal, but it shouldn't matter.
[18:53] <Tex_Nick> kunji : np ... good to see you :-)
[18:53] <ddosantos> as in my case, one of them is internal (the one which mounts ok) and the other one external

[18:54] <kunji> ddosantos: Hmm, you think it might be some sort of usb issue?  It's possible, I did have one drive in the past that didn't work because it wasn't getting enough power right at boot.
[18:55] <iceroot> zykotick9: :)
[18:55] <Grandpa_smasher> no problem kunji getting bind9 now
[18:55] <ddosantos> what I was thinking is that maybe it tried to mount it at boot, but it couldn't, then failed with the system running
[18:56] <kunji> Tex_Nick: I got that screen thing resolved eventually with jrib's help, I posted it here for someone that was having the same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2074264&page=2  turns out Flash had nothing to do with it.
[18:56] <iceroot> zykotick9: for a real dependency fight you need a newer libc6. everything else is boring and can be fixed with alot of effort
[18:56] <iceroot> zykotick9: but libc6 errors....
[18:57] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: ntfs-3g is correct according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MountingWindowsPartitions
[18:57] <Grandpa_smasher> god bind9 no is too complicated 4 me
[18:57] <Tex_Nick> kunji : great to hear that ... jrib is good ... & thanks for the link, i'll make a note of it for future reference :-)\
[18:58] <ddosantos> jhutchins_wk: yes, locale=es_ES.UTF-8 should also be

[18:58] <orudie> Hi. How can I burn .iso to a usb disk ?

[18:59] <ubottu> For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[18:59] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Those are codepages though, not localles.
[18:59] <kunji> Grandpa_smasher: Umm, sorry, wait up, bind9?  Isn't that overkill?  Maybe that wasn't the right link to be looking at.
[18:59] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: So does partwin mount correctly?
[19:00] <ddosantos> jhutchins_wk: actually it does
=== Guest22700 is now known as ryanclancy000
[19:01] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Then the format of the fstab entry is correct and should work for either one.
=== Wug is now known as Wug[Hyperspace]
[19:01] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: What happens when you try mount /media/externo?
=== game is now known as Guest1649
[19:01] <ddosantos> may fstab be in conflict with some other file that makes the drive mount on its own?
[19:02] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Not quite the way it works.
[19:02] <orudie> no, I want to burn an iso in ubuntu
[19:02] <Guest1649> hi
[19:02] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: If your fstab entry is broken, other mechanisms will mount the drive.
[19:02] <orudie> I already have ubuntu 12.04 installed. I downloaded an .iso file and now I need to burn it to a USB (not as data). Any help ?
[19:02] <kunji> Grandpa_smasher: Open up the network manager and pick the connection you're using, click edit, go to IPv4 (or 6 if you're using it already) and you should see a field for entering additional DNS servers.
[19:03] <jhutchins_wk> orudie: The instructions for installing from a usb drive will tell you how to "burn" it.
[19:03] <Grandpa_smasher> ya its blank, what should i enter
[19:03] <qhartman> orudie, the easiest way would be to mount the iso and then just copy them like you would any other files
[19:03] <ddosantos> um, that's weird
[19:03] <Guest1649> use untebootin
[19:03] <Kroach> does zenity --list --checklist/--radiolist have an item limit?
[19:03] <ddosantos> it actually mounts the drive typing mount /media/externo
[19:03] <jhutchins_wk> qhartman: That won't create a bootable drive.
[19:03] <zykotick9> qhartman: if it's a bootable iso, i highly doubt your method would work.
[19:04] <Grandpa_smasher> sudo apt-get install unetbootin
[19:04] <Guest1649> will some body tell what is full form of GRUB
[19:04] <ddosantos> thanks you all for your time
[19:04] <Grandpa_smasher> Guest1649,  full form?
[19:04] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Then it _shoud_ automount if you connect it after boot, but because the iomega has replaceable cartridges it might not.
[19:04] <qhartman> jhutchins_wk, zykotick9 - he never said that's what he needed to do, just that he had an iso and that he wanted to "burn" to usb.
[19:04] <kunji> Grandpa_smasher: Well, whatever other dns server you want to use OpenDNS maintains several, but you would need to look them up, I don't remember them.  Google maintains an easy one to remember 8.8.8.8
[19:05] <ddosantos> yes, it automounts, but in another path
[19:05] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: I think the next thing to check is seeing if it mounts properly if it's powered up at boot.
[19:05] <Grandpa_smasher> ty kunji ill try the google one
[19:05] <ddosantos> that was my idea, yes
[19:05] <ddosantos> I don't know why I didn't think of that before
[19:05] <jhutchins_wk> qhartman: Do you have an objection to using the method used for install isos?
[19:06] <Kroach> Guest1649: you mean what the shortcut stands for? GRand Unified Bootloader
[19:06] <Nitesh> any girl here.....16-22
[19:07] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: Your method _should_ work - it works for USB drives I have in order to define permissions for the mounts, but the iomega, well, rules are different.
[19:07] <kunji> Grandpa_smasher: Actually though I think it will still try the other one first, as it is primary and so it still may be slow.  You might need to set up a static ip to force it to use only the dns entries you set (I believe it grabs others through DHCP).
[19:07] <ddosantos> jhutchins_wk: thanks for the support, I will make some tests. I think I will set the settings to noauto and mount it manually when needed, as I don't it need it to be always there
[19:07] <ddosantos> don't need it*

[19:07] <Bookwormser> Hello, how do you disable tftp service?
[19:07] <Nitesh> any girl here.....16-22
[19:08] <jhutchins_wk> ddosantos: You might experiment with blkid on the drive without a cartridge vs with one.
[19:08] <mda> hello
[19:08] <jhutchins_wk> Bookwormser: How did you enable it?
[19:08] <qhartman> jhutchins_wk, not neccesarily. Depends on what the person is trying to do exactly. If they are trying to a make a bootable USB from a bootable ISO, it makes sense. If they just need the files on the drive, it's overly complicated and requires that anythingalready on the drive be lost.
[19:08] <Bookwormser> jhutchins_wk: Not sure. It came up on an audit.
[19:08] <DJones> Nitesh: Wrong channel for dating
[19:08] <ddosantos> I don't know what's a cartridge
[19:08] <mda> hello - i just installed ubuntu on an usb with universal usb installer i did  NOT choose persistant file size - does uvuntu save data on my usb if i browse or use skype !? ty
[19:09] <ddosantos> I'm googling it
[19:09] <jhutchins_wk> Bookwormser: No way to find out who enabled it & why?
[19:09] <jhutchins_wk> Bookwormser: It's not trivial to set up, so they must've had a good reason.
[19:09] <kunji> Nitesh: This is not a dating chat, stop being an asshole.
[19:09] <Bookwormser> jhutchins_wk: I can ask around. It shouldn't be enabled though, as this is just a historical data server.
[19:09] <tqrst> BluesKaj: uptime pissing contest? What? I was just asking why you were focusing on "startup scripts" given that I haven't "Started up" in forever.
[19:09] <qhartman> jhutchins_wk, if they just need the stuff from the image on the USB disk, then mounting / copying is the most expedient method to get it.
[19:09] <ddosantos> thanks again, see you another time. Bye
[19:09] <jhutchins_wk> Bookwormser: Off the top of my head /etc/init.d/tftpd stop should turn it off, then use update-rc.conf to prevent it from auto-starting.

[19:10] <Bookwormser> jhutchins_wk: Thanks, I will check it out.
[19:10] <kunji> mda: I believe not, you could just check though, since you've already installed it
[19:10] <mda> ty but how can i check ?
[19:11] <jhutchins_wk> Bookwormser: tftp is mostly used for PXE - booting from the network.  It's sometimes used to transfer files to embedded devices (programming a router).
[19:12] <kunji> mda: Umm, I mean just literally check the places you think it might be saved and see if it is.  I think you will not find any though.  For instance, you could bookmark a page, reboot, and see if there is a bookmark.

[19:20] <number9> I installed ubuntu 12.04 via the alternate install disk with lvm and full encryption onto a 320GB hard drive. When I go into thunar it tells me that I have only 80GB free, and it lists a 320GB hard drive that is unmountable as a 'removable drive' is this normal?
[19:21] <niallobroin> I'm trying to install opendkim and opendkim-tools on precise, but there's a version conflict. opendkim-tools : Breaks: opendkim (< 2.5.2+dfsg-2~) but 2.5.2+dfsg-1ubuntu3 is to be installed  Should I file a launchpad bug?
[19:22] <hillary> i installed winff in ubuntu 12.04 and it used to work but it is no longer doing any conversion. Any problem?
[19:22] <alimj> number9: I also use LVM with encryption... What you say is not normal!
[19:23] <number9> alimj: that's what I thought. When I go in in gparted things look semi normal though, a small boot partition and then an extended encrypted partition for the rest of the disk.
[19:24] <alimj> You should have everything else on that encrypted partition (including swap)
[19:24] <alimj> number9: My setup is 32gb for root, 4gb for swap and the rest for /home
[19:26] <alimj> number9: Plus one small un-encrypted 2gb partition for /boot
[19:26] <number9> alimj: thanks for your help, I might try a reinstall?
[19:27] <alimj> number9: Not necessarily.
[19:27] <alimj> number9: Please note that the system shows LVM2 partition and it can not mount it
[19:28] <ns-nazri> i have problem! i have smartphone neo L, when i connect usb in my linux, it is not working, what happen?
[19:29] <number9> alimj: well that's the weird thing is that it does mount because there is only that one partition, and so that is where my /home /swap and whatever are! But a harddrive shows up on my desktop that is 320GB that is unmountable
[19:30] <alimj> number9: That 320GB is the main LVM2 container. You should take care about the partitions within the LVM2
[19:30] <ns-nazri> but i see not have smartphone computer
[19:30] <alimj> number9: Please wait a second, I am looking into my notes to send you a useful URL
[19:31] <alimj> number9: after creating the LVM, use something like these commands: lvcreate -n swap -L 8G vg
[19:32] <hillary> any problem with my winff ubuntu 12.04
[19:32] <Phonequer> If I have libboost-filesystem1.50-dev installed, does it automatically provide libboost-filesystem-dev? The same for 1.49 ?

[19:32] <alimj> number9: Please take note of -l 100%FREE
[19:32] <alimj> number9: Then you can: mkswap  /dev/mapper/vg-swap

[19:34] <alimj> number9: Actually I created a separate lv for root (/)
[19:34] <simpleuser> But now when i launch "Kobo" in terminal i get this : "/usr/local/Kobo/Kobo: error while loading shared libraries: libicuuc.so.44: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"
[19:34] <ciccio> list
[19:34] <simpleuser> Any idea ?
[19:34] <alimj> number9: before creating /home I did: lvcreate -n root -L 32G vg
[19:35] <alimj> number9: However, you can have both /home and / on the same partition
[19:35] <alimj> number9: Or better to say, on the same logical volume...
[19:36] <number9> alimj: Thanks! I'll look into that. Is there a simple way to look into that without changing my configuration? Also will suspend (risky from a privacy standpoint, but convenient) and hibernate work?
[19:36] <alimj> yes
[19:36] <alimj> number9: One moment...
[19:37] <xkernel> is there a calender application that integrates with the desktop to give alerts on schedules?
[19:37] <simpleuser> Anyone ?
[19:37] <alimj> number9: lvextend, lvdisplay
[19:37] <alimj> number9: The first command should be able to extend a logical volume to the entire available space on volume group
[19:38] <alimj> number9: The first command is really useful. It displays the currently status
[19:39] <alimj> number9: Also lvscan

[20:00] <thechef> Is nvidia 310 going to land in Ubuntu LTS any soon as non-experimental?
[20:01] <thechef> I think on NVIDIAs side it's a non-experimental release - does the integration to LTS make problems?
[20:01] <iceroot> thechef: it will never be there normally
[20:02] <iceroot> thechef: there will be no major-updates within an ubuntu-release, only security-fixes
[20:02] <thechef> iceroot: what is then the difference between current and current-updates?
[20:03] <iceroot> thechef: you mean "precise" and "precise-updates" for example?
[20:03] <hany> can you help me?
[20:03] <thechef> iceroot: no, specifically in the case of nvidia: nvidia-current and nvidia-current-updates (at least I think that's the name of the packages)

[20:04] <hany> i want install package c++
[20:04] <Alocer> iceroot: in additional drivers.
[20:05] <thechef> iceroot: well it says in jockey or "additional drivers" that nvidia-current-updates contains "Nachträgliche Aktualisierung" which translated to english means "updates which were made available after". If I understand correctly this means that it contains drivers which were made available AFTER the release of Ubuntu LTS - so I expect it to contain 310 sooner or later..

[20:20] <Wug> my one extension which I guess I did have (installed for months, has never caused issues before, likely unrelated)
[20:20] <Alocer> Wug: so if you hadn't added the security certificate then it should give you error. am i right ?
[20:20] <Wug> it should warn me that the certificate is self signed, but it doesnt
[20:20] <Wug> I get absolutely nothing

[20:23] <Wug> Alocer: documents there are updated frequently, I've made absolutely sure that the problem is exclusive to chromium

[20:24] <Alocer> correct
[20:25] <ThinkT510> Wug: and you are using the chromium from the repo?
[20:25] <Brewster> ok so I have really ruined my computer
[20:25] <Wug> ThinkT510: chromium-browser, Version 23.0.1271.97 Ubuntu 12.04 (23.0.1271.97-0ubuntu0.12.04.1)
[20:25] <Salastil> Does anyone know of a way to launch xchat at startup that allows it to be closed to the desktop? When have it autostarted it closes and the process can't be reclaimed. However when I close it and restart the program it works just fine. Is there a command I can set in the boot sequence to do this?
[20:26] <millennia> Brewster | aww, what happened?
[20:27] <Brewster> Basically I went to update my graphics drivers and now nothing works. I set up ubuntu so that my home folder is encrypted. How would I back that up and restore it?
[20:27] <Wug> Brewster: if you hit ctrl+alt+F1 do you get a shell?
[20:27] <Wug> if you do you can fix things from there
[20:28] <drokita> What forum does one go to discuss Ubuntu kernel upgrade problems
[20:28] <drokita> ?
[20:28] <shock_one> drokita, try askubuntu
[20:28] <Brewster> it goes to a terminal log in but after like 15 seconds the monitor loses signal and everything freezes
[20:28] <drokita> shock_one: thanks!
[20:29] <millennia> Brewster | you could back up it's data in encrypted form, but there might be no way to restore it from another Os install
[20:29] <Brewster> I have that key that it gave me when it was encrypted
[20:30] <Wug> Brewster: try a different monitor.  The terminal should more or less always work and does not require graphics drivers to work.  I've had monitors that didn't like to display the ttys for long
[20:30] <Wug> they'd flicker back and forth between showing it and "signal out of band"
[20:30] <millennia> Brewster | ok. then maybe you could
[20:31] <Brewster> I guess this was for the better... I was planning on backing everything up and then installing windows for gaming and then ubuntu on top of it for a while now
[20:32] <Wug> Brewster: chances are you could boot to single user mode or something and fix the drivers
[20:33] <Wug> you could probably also boot it and ssh into it
[20:33] <Wug> borked graphics shouldnt stop ssh from working
[20:35] <millennia> Brewster | Is you graphics/monitor setup anything special or just a standard one video card and one monitor?

[20:37] <DJones> sobotka Without details, nobody will know whether they can help
[20:37] <sobotka> i have a 10.10 ubuntu netbook remix
[20:37] <sobotka> on my netbook
[20:38] <bekks> sobotka: 10.10 isnt supported anymore.
[20:38] <Wug> just ask anyway
[20:38] <sobotka> i know. so i think it's time to get rid of it
[20:38] <sobotka> what do you suggest i should do: upgrade 11.04 then 11.10 or clean install
[20:38] <Brewster> millennia: one video card 2 monitors
[20:38] <millennia> sobotka | you see, if it was 10.04 it would still be supported :)
[20:38] <sobotka> yea i know
[20:39] <Brewster> oh ssh
[20:39] <millennia> sobotka | always go for the clean install
[20:39] <Brewster> didn't think of that
[20:39] <OerHeks> sobotka, my choice would be do a clean install
[20:40] <millennia> Brewster | does it work with just one monitor? connected?
[20:40] <Brewster> sure
[20:40] <sobotka> of course, clean install seams right, but it's more painful for me: usb boot out of the question
[20:40] <Brewster> I can turn one off and it works just fine
[20:40] <sobotka> *seems
[20:40] <sobotka> so is it really nasty to try to double upgrade?
[20:41] <millennia> Brewster | that narrows down your problem. The drivers are ok and don't need to be reinstalled. You just need to configure them for dual monitors
[20:41] <Brewster> le sigh
[20:42] <belgianguy> at this point, if I get a VPS, am I better off with 12.10 or 12.04 LTS?
[20:42] <bekks> belgianguy: 12.04
[20:42] <belgianguy> for a server I'd opt for 12.04 LTS
[20:42] <Brewster> but I know the drivers don't work now. Apparently 310 doesn

[20:43] <sobotka> millennia: i've upgraded several times before with no problems whatsoever, but never attempted a double upgrade

[20:53] <Brewster> yes
[20:53] <Wug> hey, I fixed it
[20:53] <Wug> I had an old certificate stored for it

[21:36] <kunji> paoloumali:Oh, yeah, I thought you were trying with sudo and it wasn't working for you (that can be configured to restrict access particularly over ssh).
[21:36] <jrib> BrianV_: presumably that's just the old one?  But check: ps -ef | grep 26055

[21:37] <User23> does any one know how to fix amd proprietary drivers for ubuntu 12.10, all i can see is just the background i can bring up terminal. Thanks!
[21:37] <ThinkT510> drhead: nomodeset just disables kernel mode setting, some drivers can act funny with it on
[21:37] <paoloumali> kunji, i have no issue with sudo and working with vi too. just need confirmation as i just realized right now, this is really how linux is. to secure server, most will deactivate password and just use ssh keys?
[21:38] <User23> can any one point me to a fix? please :D
[21:38] <jrib> BrianV_: « cat /etc/init/cron.conf* »    output on pastebin
[21:38] <drhead> ThinkT510: 11.10 on this one, but its just a copy I installed while troubleshooting some problems on this pc.  I haven't actively used Linux for about four years.
[21:39] <kunji> paoloumali: That is used in the case where you need to automate tasks between servers, but you should use a password in conjunction with keys for the best security.
[21:39] <jrib> BrianV_: do you have any other services not starting?
[21:39] <paoloumali> also, since will use this to host mainly a site, is it proper to create a user, and then use his home directory as location for the web files instead of the var/www?
[21:39] <BrianV_> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1583722/
[21:39] <jrib> BrianV_: why is it all commented?
[21:39] <paoloumali> kunji, I will use them both then. but what happens if i lost my key, there will be no way anymore to access my server right?
[21:40] <BrianV_> jrib: yes after a reboot I have to start apache2 and mysql manually
[21:40] <ikonia> BrianV_: how about telling us what you've really done
[21:40] <ikonia> your config file is all commented out
[21:40] <ikonia> that doesn't happen on it's own
[21:40] <BrianV_> jrib: I don't know, I have not installed my server.
[21:40] <paoloumali> kunji, i'm on another thread and someone commented about using sftp. is there any security issue with sftp?
[21:40] <jrib> BrianV_: you should discuss these things with the person that installed it... cron isn't starting because its init file is all comments
[21:41] <BrianV_> jrib: ok, but is there a way we can fix this now? or do I have to ask my friend who installed my server?
[21:41] <User23> amd driver fix one ubuntu 12.10? anyone
[21:42] <jrib> BrianV_: you can remove one column of comments from the file
[21:42] <ikonia> User23: problem description, worthless...anyone
[21:42] <kunji> paoloumali: Hmm, not really, come to think of it, that might be a home directory already (for the user apache runs as), but I'm not sure as I don't have apache installed on this machine at the moment.  I wouldn't do it though.  If you lose the key you will not have remote access to the server, someone with physical access could restore access to you, so it would probably involve talking to azure tech support, but you could get access back. 
[21:42] <BrianV_> jrib: which column should I remove?
[21:42] <jrib> BrianV_: the first one
[21:43] <jrib> BrianV_: just the '#' but if there are two '##' then just make it '#'
[21:43] <ikonia> I'd find out why it's disabled before re-enabling it
[21:43] <paoloumali> kunji, awesome! I think I need to read a book on ubuntu web hosting security. do you have any recommendation?
[21:44] <BrianV_> jrib: something like this? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1583736/
[21:44] <jrib> BrianV_: yes, but pay mind to ikonia's advice
[21:45] <kunji> paoloumali: I don't have any books for it, I usually just google extensively.  This is a pretty good site though: http://www.cyberciti.biz/  Also Ubuntu has some very good documentation for server, both official and community.

[21:46] <BrianV_> jrib: well if I may guess, my friend did not pay attention to cronjob. But if it ain't comment out by default, I will ask him first.
[21:47] <CyberGlitch> Anyone have luck with getting serial console working with a preseed file on 12.10?
[21:47] <ikonia> BrianV_: pay attention to crontab ??? he clearly did as he's taken the time to learn how to disable it cleanly
[21:47] <ikonia> BrianV_: it looks like it's you who's not paid attention by trying incorrect synatax in your crontab file
[21:48] <CyberGlitch> I can get it to work after the fact but I am unsure how to do it with an answer file
[21:48] <BrianV_> jrib: I will ask him first, before enable it again.
[21:48] <jrib> BrianV_: ok

[22:22] <ubottu> tbruff13: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[22:23] <escott> belgianguy, anything preventing you from making the ~/.ssh directory
[22:23] <jetter> I am using english.. I think i do. ;) So any keyboard masters? My concept: ssjs v8 on fastcgi with lighttpd.
[22:23] <k1l> tbruff13: access files ar only supported under windows iirc
[22:23] <belgianguy> escott: no, but I wasn't sure whether that would be autocreated by a package
[22:23] <belgianguy> or whether one can just add that folder
[22:24] <escott> belgianguy, nothing in $HOME is auto created unless it is part of /etc/skel
[22:24] <belgianguy> escott: now I created the .ssh dir, but when I execute my ssh-copy-id, it still fails with that error
[22:24] <ross`> how long can a gpart recovery take on a 750gb drive with 7 total partitions, lvm inside extended fourth partition
[22:25] <ross`> not 7 real partitions, not lvm virtuals
[22:25] <escott> belgianguy, is it complaining that you dont have an id_rsa on the computer you are running ssh-copy-id from
[22:25] <ross`> *note* 7 real partitions, not lvm virtuals9~
[22:25] <belgianguy> escott: oh, am I not supposed to run it from the remote machine? I ssh'ed into it after using scp to upload my public key
[22:26] <MonkeyDust> ross`  sounds too specific, best way would be to try and find out
[22:26] <ross`> MonkeyDust: i am trying, i want to know when i can consider this dead
[22:26] <ross`> i.e. 3 hours vs waiting 13 hours
[22:26] <ozzloy> byobu stopped showing the status line for me.  how do i get it back?
[22:26] <ross`> i want to know when it isn't gonna work by
[22:26] <belgianguy> escott: I could generate another keypair on the remote machine
[22:26] <MonkeyDust> ozzloy  F9
[22:26] <ozzloy> i want a list of windows, the current window hilited, that sort of thing. just like before
[22:27] <escott> belgianguy, all it does is scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa user@remote:~/tempfile; followed by cat ~/tempfile ~/.ssh/auth_keys on the remote server
[22:27] <escott> ross`, what is "recovery"
[22:27] <ross`> escott: it is refinding partition bounds
[22:27] <ross`> because somehow it got off by like 8kb
[22:27] <robertzaccour> Anyone else aware of a Kdenlive bug? I thought it may be my system but the bug still there on live iso boot. Whenever I click render it crashes.
[22:27] <ross`> but idk how to do it manually so
[22:28] <ross`> i'm using gpart to auto do it
[22:28] <robertzaccour> so its definitely Ubuntu specific bug.
[22:28] <robertzaccour> But the question is, could it be distro specific?
[22:28] <robertzaccour> I mean distro version.
[22:28] <belgianguy> escott: isn't that the private key? the tutorial I'm following uploads the public key (.pub)
[22:28] <ozzloy> MonkeyDust, i'm gonna need a bit more help than that
[22:28] <escott> ross`, should take only as long as it would to read the entire disk
[22:28] <escott> belgianguy, yeah the pub
[22:29] <ozzloy> MonkeyDust, i don't see a setting there for toggling the status line entirely
[22:29] <belgianguy> escott: I did that, but now I don't get what your cat statement does
[22:29] <ross`> escott: is there a reading harddrive calculator with given harddrive speed, cpu, ram, options?
[22:29] <belgianguy> that file doesn't exist yet here
[22:29] <escott> belgianguy, all it does is scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub user@remote:~/tempfile; followed by cat ~/tempfile > ~/.ssh/auth_keys on the remote server
[22:30] <escott> belgianguy, sorry im reading other things and only half paying attention.
[22:30] <jhutchins_wk> belgianguy: 1) create keypair on local machine. 2) copy public key to remote machine and append to authorized_keys file.  (This can be done by ssh-copy-id.)
[22:30] <belgianguy> escott, jhutchins_wk: It's the ssh-copy-id that refuses to work
[22:30] <ross`> belgianguy: i'm bored, please tell me what you are trying to do and i will write a shell script to do it
[22:30] <belgianguy> the other steps worked
[22:30] <escott> belgianguy, im just not clear on what machine you are seeing the error message
[22:30] <jhutchins_wk> escott: does ssh-copy-id create the remote directory?
[22:30] <belgianguy> escott: on the remote machine
[22:30] <belgianguy> I ssh'ed into it
[22:30] <jhutchins_wk> belgianguy: That would appear to be because you skipped step 1.
[22:30] <ross`> belgianguy: just use scp and cat >>
[22:31] <escott> belgianguy, you dont run ssh-copy-id on the remote machine

[22:31] <belgianguy> jhutchins_wk: I did generate a keypair with a password
[22:31] <escott> belgianguy, it copies the local key to the remote machine and is run on the local machine
[22:31] <jhutchins_wk> belgianguy: You also don't run ssh-keygen on the remote machine.
[22:31] <belgianguy> jhutchins_wk: I ran ssh-keygen on my local machine
[22:31] <escott> unless you are flipping the meaning of local and remote on us
[22:31] <belgianguy> and uploaded the .pub through scp
[22:31] <belgianguy> I'm not
[22:31] <escott> belgianguy, then you dont need copy-id
[22:32] <jhutchins_wk> belgianguy: Now run ssh-copy-id on the local machine with the remote user@machine as the target.
[22:32] <ross`> belgianguy: did you cat >> into known_hosts?
[22:32] <ross`> er
[22:32] <ross`> authorized_hosts2 i think
[22:32] <jhutchins_wk> ross`: authorized_keys
[22:32] <ross`> yea
[22:32] <ross`> thats it
[22:32] <ross`> i'm going from memory
[22:32] <escott> belgianguy, if you already copied the pub file you can cat your.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and change the permissions
[22:32] <FloodBot1> ross`: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[22:32] <ross`> belgianguy: listen to escott , that is what i suggest
[22:32] <jhutchins_wk> escott: Shouldn't realy need to change permissions...
[22:32] <ross`> don't use the fancy tools, keep is simple, this way you understand what it is doing and why.
[22:33] <escott> jhutchins_wk, no they have to be locked down from the default
[22:33] <ross`> RSA will error if your permissions are public
[22:33] <ross`> i believe
[22:34] <jhutchins_wk> ross`: I guess it depends on the mask.

[22:46] <atlef> chris_, what exactly went wrong?
[22:46] <belgianguy> escott: I find the tutorial silly for not mentioning it
[22:46] <belgianguy> escott: the good news is that this is my test setup

[22:46] <belgianguy> so I can "intervene" here

[22:51] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: The installer does it's best to get wifi working.  THat's the "single script".  For outlying cards that don't work properly without special steps there isn't one consistent method that gets all of them working.
[22:51] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: Some brains required.
[22:52] <malkauns> katsumeblisk, nope, i too am running on a fresh install, i changed the window close shortkey to ctrl +` but it doesn't work
[22:53] <katsumeblisk> malkauns: You didn't say that. I thought you were referring to the Unity shorcuts.
[22:53] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: Broadcom isn't very linux friendly.  Because they're so common, developers have done a pretty good job of reverse-engineering them and have gotten many working - but Broadcom keeps breaking them.
[22:53] <belgianguy> escott: smart that, learned something important
[22:53] <katsumeblisk> malkauns: I just tried that and it works. You sure it was set?
[22:53] <malkauns> katsumeblisk, no, i meant keyboard shortcuts from the config that pops up when u search for "keyboard" in the unity launcher
[22:53] <chris_> jhutchins_wk: If you want to pretend that knowledge of something so esoteric as getting broadband drivers working constitutes "brains" then that's fine
[22:53] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: Also, Broadcom licenses their designs to other manufacturers who often implement them badly.
[22:54] <katsumeblisk> malkauns: I set the close window shortcut to Ctrl + ` and it worked.
[22:54] <malkauns> katsumeblisk, mm weird!! :(
[22:54] <malkauns> katsumeblisk, doesn't work at all for me
[22:54] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: could you do an lspci -nn and get me the eight character PCI ID of the card?
[22:54] <sect0r> is there away to just restart x?
[22:54] <malkauns> any idea why anyone??

[22:56] <escott> belgianguy, you must be the only person to be able to modify files and folders from auth_keys up to the first root owned directory
[22:56] <escott> belgianguy, so that includes auth_keys file, .ssh and ~
[22:57] <belgianguy> escott: not sure here, do I need to execute additional chmod commands? :/
[22:57] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: Hm.  Should work with the ssb or wl modules.
[22:57] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: Should not require ndiswrapper or dkms or even firmware.
[22:58] <belgianguy> my file is called authorized_keys instead of auth_keys, does that matter?
[22:59] <escott> belgianguy, chmod g-w,o-w ~ ~/.ssh ~/.ssh/*
[22:59] <escott> belgianguy, its the long form of the name i just dont like typing that many characters
[22:59] <chris_> jhutchins_wk: it's strange how in Live CD mode the Additional Drivers dialogue appeared and knew about the broadcom, but now there is no sign of it.
[23:00] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: It's confirmed to work with Debian Stable, 2.6.26
[23:00] <belgianguy> escott: thanks, going to try that now :)
[23:01] <jhutchins_wk> belgianguy: That is the correct name for the file.  Must be as expected by ssh/sshd.
[23:01] <chris_> jhutchins_wk: Debian 6?
[23:01] <jhutchins_wk> chris_: Yes, you would expect it to just work.
[23:02] <ClientAlive> When generating ssh shared keys to connect two computers, do you have to do it on both computers for it to work? I had this set up on my old laptop but now need to set it up on this one.
[23:04] <escott> ClientAlive, there are a lot of keys involved in ssh what keys do you mean?
[23:06] <ClientAlive> escott: The way I had it set up before was so all I have to do to connect (in either direction) is type ssh <hostname>  (in the form of the text hostname you see on your command line).
[23:06] <away> ClientAlive, yes, both
[23:06] <away> just use ssh-copy-id on both machines and you should be good to go
[23:06] <escott> ClientAlive, if that is what you want then sure
[23:06] <ClientAlive> so do i have to delete the keys that are on the one computer so I can start fresh?
[23:07] <away> just use ssh-copy-id, it appends the new key(s) to the end of ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
[23:07] <macswell> System kernel panics ~1-2 seconds after unplugging ac-power (switching to battery). Any ideas on how I may resolve this?
[23:07] <ClientAlive> or just edit some file to have the correct ip address to this computer?
[23:07] <belgianguy> jhutchins_wk: so what was the correct spelling?
[23:08] <escott> ClientAlive, you put the pub key on machines you want to access with a given identity. so A has id_rsa and is equal or higher security than B, C, D so you put the id_rsa.pub from A onto B,C,D to give A access to B,C,D

[23:08] <tsinnema> what should be my java setup if i want sound from java to work with pulseaudio?
[23:10] <ClientAlive> I see. So it sounds thus to me: Call computer A the computer with the existing keys and call computer B the new computer with no keys. Then simply put the existing files from computer A onto computer  B. Then generate keys on Computer A. Then move the newly created files from Computer A to computer B. Done.
[23:10] <ClientAlive> is that the correct algorithm?
[23:10] <escott> ClientAlive, no A already has keys, why would you generate keys on A if A already has keys
[23:11] <ClientAlive> perhaps I got the letters confused. Good greif to me!
[23:11] <escott> ClientAlive, A has an id_rsa so you can ssh-copy-id user@B to give A access to B
[23:11] <escott> ClientAlive, if you consider A and B to be the same level of security and should be compromised equally
[23:11] <escott> ClientAlive, then ssh-keygen on B, and ssh-copy-id user@A from B

[23:16] <BLZbubba> how well does ubuntu handle booting over iscsi with a NIC BIOS (as opposed to a proper HBA)?
[23:16] <BLZbubba> centos is of course lame compare to ubuntu but they do have a nice iscsi boot option
[23:17] <escott> BLZbubba, it should not matter provided the bootloader supports it. you might check #grub
[23:17] <wingman182> I'm trying to attempt to install 12.10 to a blank machine without access to a thumb drive or a blank RW. I can pull the HDD and install what ever I need to it and then swap. Is it possible?

[23:19] <wingman182> I tried doing it once using the windows installer, but the MBR was too screwed up to work in the new system
[23:20] <escott> belgianguy, that shouldn't matter. can you post your auth_keys file to paste.ubuntu.com as well as the output of ls -ld . .ssh; and ls -l .ssh
[23:20] <wingman182> is it possible to write a MBR of a secondary disk and make it think its primary? So that when it gets deployed to a new system, it boots straight from it?
[23:21] <belgianguy> escott: the server upstairs doesn't have a gui, is there a cli option to upload files to paste.ubuntu.com ?
[23:21] <zykotick9> !pastebinit | belgianguy
[23:21] <ubottu> belgianguy: pastebinit is the command-line equivalent of !pastebin - Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output - To use pastebinit, install the « pastebinit » package from a package manager - Simple usage: command | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com

[23:27] <wingman182> maybe if I rephrase things...... I want to install unbuntu to a different system taking advantage of a hotswap drive bay on my windows machine. Install Ubuntu to the drive, and then place it in the new system. Any suggestions?
[23:27] <belgianguy> I guess I'll roll back my changes in the morning and go hunt for a better tutorial, and will initialize communications with the original poster, notifying him of the fact that he has the intellect of a fruit fly
[23:28] <escott> wingman182, it should work fine

[23:35] <dns53> _helios_ it times out after a while? if you are using something like putty you should set an option to send keep alive packets
[23:36] <_helios_> dns53: what is happening is when I ssh user@address it says Connection Timed out,  however when I was where the machine is located everything worked fine.
[23:36] <esph> Which directories would it be adviseable to put under my 24GB mSATA SSD, and which on my HDD?
[23:36] <_helios_> dns53: I don't think the client is giving the server enough time to respond.

[23:39] <esph> escott: basically just to utilize teh faster storage as much as possible
[23:39] <esph> the*
[23:39] <daywalker2012> i`ve got a problem - should is use openjdk 6 or 7?
[23:39] <escott> esph, then limit your total data usage to less than 24GB
[23:40] <daywalker2012> with xubuntu 12.04 - on an old computer :)
[23:41] <dns53> _helios_ timing out connecting probably means that it is not open, have you tried running nmap to confirm that the port you are using for ssh is open?
[23:41] <_helios_> dns53: I think the problem might be that my system went into standby at the house forgot to change the settings.
[23:42] <esph> gotta love the ever-snarky denizens of irc-land

=== ray is now known as artrafael
[23:43] <escott> esph, you are going to have to prioritize and to prioritize you need to state meaningful goals

[23:44] <esph> escott: If you can give me some examples of meaningful goals, that would help. All I basically know is that the SSD is faster, and that putting some things there will improve performance
[23:45] <randypopabawa> Hey all. Anyone else tried loading Ubuntu on a Samsung NP35 series?
[23:45] <daywalker2012> hmm
[23:46] <esph> escott: Ok, well, most programs are in /usr, right? So I'll put that there. What kind of performance gains would I see if i put /etc there, or /var there?
[23:46] <daywalker2012> ok  - thx for help :(
[23:46] <randypopabawa> I've heard mixed reviews about AMD-A6's and Linux is why I ask.
[23:46] <escott> esph, programs may start faster
[23:47] <daywalker2012> i can  `t reach the ww seites in this way
[23:47] <escott> esph, also having /usr on a different disk is not a support configuration
[23:47] <escott> esph, you can have / on a disk or /usr/share/games for instance but not /usr in general
[23:47] <escott> esph, if you "ldd /sbin | grep usr" you will see that there are binaries in sbin that will break without /us
[23:48] <esph> escott: but /ect and /var can be on a different disk?
[23:48] <esph> etc*
[23:48] <escott> esph, /etc has to be on the same disk as / otherwise you cant find /etc/fstab
[23:48] <esph> ok
[23:48] <escott> esph, /var can be on a different disk
[23:48] <esph> just /var
[23:48] <esph> So I'll put / on the SSD, and possibly /var
[23:49] <esph> what goes in /var (besides logs)
[23:49] <escott> esph, /var, /home, /opt are the most common directories to find on other partitions
[23:49] <escott> esph, lots and mail spools and other stuff that changes a lot. i think "var" means "varies"
[23:49] <esph> ok
[23:50] <Tex_Nick> randypopabawa : i'm running 12.10 on an AMD A6-3500 APU ... it's a custom built box though ... no problems here
[23:50] <escott> esph, so putting that on an SSD will make some of those applications faster but will burn out the SSD faster
[23:50] <esph> right
[23:50] <escott> esph, depends on if those are performance sensitive to you or not
[23:50] <esph> opt also has binaries, right?
[23:50] <randypopabawa> Hm.
