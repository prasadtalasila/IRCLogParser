[20:53] <daker> mhall119: look at the second place
[20:55] <JoseeAntonioR> urgh, no peru there
[20:56] <philipballew> San Diego is still the best place to go in my mind.
[20:57]  * philipballew offers free bed and or floor to anyone needing to stay here.
[21:03] <daker> philipballew: San Diego in USA ?
[21:03] <philipballew> daker, yes.
[21:34] <jono_> jcastro, want to blow your mind?
[21:34] <jono_> listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMZBjfvQ4Tw
[21:42] <snap-l> jono_: Ever listened to Chthonic? (sp, likely)
[21:43] <snap-l> http://www.amazon.com/Mirror-of-Retribution/dp/B002TVMX2Q/ref=tmm_other_meta_binding_title_0
[21:45] <IdleOne> jono_: wow!
[21:46] <IdleOne> Always liked that Arabic sound. This takes that sound and adds some \m/ to it.
[21:48] <daker> IdleOne: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUYvroMlRlo (2003)
[21:48] <jono_> IdleOne, isnt it awesome? :-)
[21:48] <IdleOne> it really is
[21:48] <jono_> jcastro, can we chat tomorrow while I drive out to the valley?
[21:49] <jono_> want to sync up ready for the Friday call
[21:50] <snap-l> Also, Xes Dreams has that middle-eastern oriental sound.
[21:51] <snap-l> unfortunately I can't seem to locate the link I had, and Google thinks Xes is an anagram.
[21:54] <IdleOne> daker: merveilleux!
[21:54] <jono_> snap-l, I haven't, will check them out
[21:55] <JanC> snap-l: use "" around it?
[21:56] <snap-l> http://dark-music.org/xes-dreams-nc-17-2011-2cd/
[21:56] <snap-l> JanC: That worked. Thank you.
[21:56] <daker> IdleOne: i have another syrien band but they sing in Arabic
[21:56] <IdleOne> You don't need to speak the language to appreciate good music
[21:57] <IdleOne> :)
[21:58] <JanC> some bands even... don't sing!  :p
[21:59] <daker> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHdGlevSyf0
[21:59] <daker> i hope you will like it
[22:01] <IdleOne> daker what does waladi mean?
[22:01] <daker> IdleOne: my son
[22:01] <IdleOne> ah ok. google was failing
[22:01] <JanC> IdleOne: it's written below the video..
[22:02] <IdleOne> hah, I didn't see that
[22:02] <IdleOne> thanks
[22:08] <daker> IdleOne: so basically the father(who is speaking) is giving his son advices on how to fight for life
[22:08] <daker> and to stay stronger, etc...
[22:12] <daker> IdleOne: FYI, this is a peom written by a tunisian, composed by an egyptien (the one you hear at the end of the song)
[22:19] <JanC> I think the only Egyptian music I have is rather old (Om Kalsoum, or however you want to spell it)
[22:22] <daker> JanC: NO
[22:23] <daker> JanC: Oum Kalthoum songs are one of the most difficultes songs :D
[22:24] <JanC> I don't understand the lyrics, but the music is good
[22:24] <daker> IdleOne: want another one ?
[22:25] <IdleOne> I am still mlistening to Myrath but sure send me all the links you want :)
[22:26] <daker> JanC: nowdays you can't say that your are an Arabic singer if you can't sing at least one song from Oum Kalthoum or Fairuz
[22:28] <daker> IdleOne: another group Kulna Saw (All together), and the song is "I am a terrorist" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sn8ORQaD2Y
[22:28] <JanC> daker: I also have a CD from French/Moroccan singer Sapho, where she sings El Atlal
[22:32] <JanC> and I have several albums of Natacha Atlas of course, who was born in Belgium, but has some Egyptian ancestry through her father
[22:32] <daker> JanC: i don't know here but El Atlal is one of the best/beautiful songs
[22:32] <JanC> it's her most famous song, I think?
[22:34] <daker> yes because it's beautiful in both the way she sing and the poem
[22:36] <daker> JanC: and a song for Oum Kalthoum is not 3min :D (>8min)
[22:36] <JanC> more like 1 hour  ☺
[22:37] <JanC> well, depends on how break it up
[22:37] <daker> JanC: look this is the Cairo Stadium (FULL) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAiYscbRQBU
[22:39]  * JanC listens to “Hazihi Leilati (live)” by Om Kalsoum from “Houwa Sahih El Hawa Ghalab” (39:21)
[22:39] <JanC> the other track is also 32 minutes  :p
[22:40] <JanC> different latin spellings of her name depend on the country where her albums are (re)published, I think
[22:42] <JanC> I also have an album named "Fakkaroni" from her
[22:43] <JanC> both picked up in a second hand shop  ☺
[22:44] <daker> and trust me the arabic/classic singing is one the most difficulte https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_maqam
[22:46] <JanC> I don't think I have anything by Fairuz, but I have an album from Sabah too (famous Lebanese singer)
[22:50] <daker> JanC: Yes it's a very well known one of my favorite songs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ytdzrj_5TiM
[22:53] <JanC> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bYslK20Gk0 --> is Sapho
[22:59] <daker> JanC: This on my top list because of the composition/lyrics also it's for Palestine, i used to sign it when i was 15 for music lessons https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUzrXrdo1Tc
[23:06] <daker> JanC: if you want some dance ملحم بركات https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5pdWYa4O1o
