[13:53] <smartboyhw> Gee thx zequence for the testimonial:)
[14:56] <smartboyhw> len-1304, consider writing me a testimonial?
[16:06] <len-1304> WOW fancy new software updater.
[18:17] <holstein> ok.. how do we set cpu freq?
[18:18] <holstein> we, meaning, not me.. not with 'sudo cpufreq-set -r -g performance'
[18:19] <len-1304> holstein, Not sure what you mean... the we not me thing.
[18:20] <len-1304> It has to be done in root.
[18:20] <len-1304> It has to be done per core
[18:20] <holstein> like, how can a new user, not a programmer, coming to ubuntustudio do something that needs to be done
[18:20] <holstein> simply
[18:20] <holstein> with a GUI
[18:20] <holstein> like we could in gnome2
[18:21] <holstein> i think that is something a moderately advanced user might want
[18:21] <len-1304> holstein, I think the first step is to set the default to user
[18:21] <holstein> len-1304: you mean, default control?
[18:22] <len-1304> There are a number of cpu freq modes. There in ondemand, conservative, performance etc.
[18:23] <len-1304> There is also a user mode.
[18:23] <len-1304> There is a thing called xfce4-cpufreq-plugin
[18:24] <holstein> i install that
[18:25] <holstein> but it cant change anything
[18:25] <holstein> its a nice GUI too
[18:25] <len-1304> All it can do right now with ondemand is monitor, but if set to userfreq I think it can.
[18:25] <len-1304> Let me test.
[18:26] <holstein> len-1304: i dont understand how to set to "userfreq".. i think that is the issue im having
[18:27] <len-1304> holstein, Can't even try it on this computer :P
[18:27] <len-1304> It runs full speed always
[18:28] <len-1304> Be back in a minute.
[18:28] <holstein> len-1304: no worries.. i can run th CLI command
[18:28] <holstein> i just think its a regression that we might be able to address
[18:30] <Len-nb> OK, this computer does the right stuff
[18:32] <Len-nb> cpufreq-info shows that the governors are:
[18:32] <Len-nb> conservative, ondemand, userspace, powersave, performance
[18:34] <Len-nb> So cpufreq-set -c 0 -g USERSPACE sets things to user space
[18:34] <holstein> OH.. lemme try that
[18:35] <Len-nb> Well it doesn't let the gui change speed.
[18:36] <holstein> yeah... thats what i think we need
[18:36] <holstein> like in gnome2
[18:36] <holstein> from like ubuntu 7.10 and on
[18:36] <holstein> just recently regressed to a commandline only task
[18:38] <Len-nb> OK even as a userspace I still need sudo to change speed.
[18:38] <holstein> what does "userspace" do then?
[18:38] <Len-nb> What I did.... :)  is I set up runlevel 2 as ondemend and runlevel 3 as performance
[18:39] <Len-nb> I have a command that can from userspace change runlevel
[18:39] <holstein> i used to just install an applet
[18:39] <holstein> i remember giving it permission
[18:39] <Len-nb> run level 3 is "audio clean"
[18:39] <holstein> thats a great idea
[18:40] <holstein> my studio machine hasnt been used much
[18:40] <Len-nb> I have an icon that gives three modes, desktop, audio, video and graphics
[18:40] <holstein> i had it uni-tasking
[18:40] <holstein> i hooked it up to my new-ish TV and now im using it more
[18:40] <holstein> daily even
[18:41] <holstein> i'll be fine setting some shorcuts on the desktop to run the modes
[18:41] <Len-nb> In audio mode, cron, anacrom, atd, mysql and my wifi are shut off
[18:41] <Len-nb> Oh and the cpu is performance
[18:42] <Len-nb> I can also have the same utility shut off PA-jack bridging
[18:43] <Len-nb> But I have found with the rest of the things I did, I don't really need to.
[18:44] <holstein> we shoud talk about working that into a GUI for the repos
[18:44] <holstein> a studio specific thing
[18:44] <holstein> things that we shouldnt do by default
[18:44] <Len-nb> I wrote it using: alltray, tk/tcl, bash and the polkit.
[18:45] <Len-nb> And upstart of course.
[18:46] <Len-nb> I would like to change the gui to python before I try releasing it, as tk doesn't play well with systray stuff
[18:48] <Len-nb> holstein, cadence, from falktx, looks like it will be able to do some of this. It is headed in that direction.
[18:48] <Len-nb> Also the controls app zequence is working on.
[18:48] <Len-nb> I am not sure a third app is a good thing :)
[18:50] <Len-nb> Still I do have a command line that works now... it does need sudo file editing to configure it to the system though.
[18:54] <Len-nb> holstein, The thing to remember with performance mode is that many computers are noisier because the CPU fans are on full all the time.
[18:54] <Len-nb> Sometimes very good performance can be had with a lower than full speed cpu that is not changing speed.
[18:56] <Len-nb> I found for example, I could get no xruns on this netbook running at half speed, but not with ondemand.
[19:06] <holstein> mine is quiet though
[19:06] <holstein> most of the time i have it on on demend
[19:06] <holstein> demand*
[19:06] <holstein> the studio rig
[19:06] <holstein> i just like to bump it up to track
[19:40] <Len-nb> holstein, I have a bad wireless IF. My desktop is much better. The netbook would hardly be called a "pro audio" platform.
[19:40] <Len-nb> However, it does show up weakness in a system
