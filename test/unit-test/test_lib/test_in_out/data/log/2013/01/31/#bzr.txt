[00:00] <mwhudson> i think create_clone_on_transport might be the more 'bzr branch'y api
[00:05] <mwhudson> i wonder what the no_tree argument does

[11:49] <spacecowboy29> A question, I'm not able to connect to lanchpad, I'm using corkscrew since I'm behind a proxy,  I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong... http://paste.ubuntu.com/1592875/
[11:50] <mgz> from yesterday, can you ssh to anywhere at all like that?
[11:51] <mgz> if not you really need corkscrew help, not bazaar/launchpad help.
[11:51] <spacecowboy29> yes, hi :) no I'm not able to ssh anywhere else
[11:52] <spacecowboy29> I followed the corkscrew help, by adding the config file "Proxy Command 172.16.35.90 8080 %h%p"
[11:55] <mgz> spacecowboy29: can you http proxy through the given ip and address?
[11:55] <spacecowboy29> I was able to connect using bzr when I removed my username from bazaar.conf
[11:58] <spacecowboy29> bzr branch lp:calibre, seems to work fine when I'm not using a username from bazaar.conf, so I should get some corkscrew help ?  Does bzr handle ssh through https on it's own ?
[11:58] <mgz> did you have HTTP_PROXY set?
[11:59] <spacecowboy29> yes I set it system wide in the Networks option
[12:01] <spacecowboy29> But this was working before, I must have borked some config file or something, if this doesn't work I'll have to reinstall the os, then I'll know for sure....
[12:02] <mgz> google "ssh corkscrew" or something, from their readme it seems it only works against certain http proxies
[12:02] <mgz> so, you might need to find out what http proxy is and if it's on the supported list
[12:05] <spacecowboy29> ok will do, thanks :)

[17:40] <DarylXian> hi.  can bzr checkout a single revision/tag from a remote repo, or do i have to pull the entire repo, then select/switch to a tag locally?
[17:40] <LeoNerd> bzr co -rFOO URL
[17:40] <LeoNerd> -r123 or -rtag:NAME or whatever
[17:42] <DarylXian> LeoNerd: ah, simple enough. noted!  thx.
[17:42] <LeoNerd> The commandset is usually quite orthogonal like that. Most commands that can care about a specific revision take a -r for example
[17:51] <DarylXian> LeoNerd: when i bzr co -rtag:FOO, am I still pulling the complete repo, in terms of total MB, but just ending up in the FOO-tag state?  or Am I actually pulling less content?
[17:51] <LeoNerd> Er... hrmm.. Notsure offhand
[17:52] <DarylXian> I'm trying to avoid, specifically, pulling the entire MySQL repo just to get at the latest code.  It's *huge* (&/or slow ...)
[17:53] <LeoNerd> Oh. So you'll still get all the history up until that point
[17:53] <LeoNerd> So even if you pull -r1000 you'll get -r1 to -r999 as well. I'm just not sure if it will pull any history -past- that; -r1001 and onwards
[17:54] <DarylXian> ah, so not a solution.  unless 'they' create a tarball from a specific checkout, I get all the prior history. :-/
[17:54] <LeoNerd> Yah
[17:54] <DarylXian> well, rats.
[18:05] <DarylXian> thx
[18:07] <bsd> Oh DarylXian left â€” he could use a stacked branch

[19:04] <LeoNerd> Is there a handy way I can store locally in a workdir, some extra name=value information related to a specific branch?
[19:04] <LeoNerd> I'm writign some wrapper automation scripts, and I need to keep track of some more details
[19:05] <mgz> LeoNerd: `bzr config --scope=branch leo-special=1`?
[19:06] <LeoNerd> Hmmm.... that might work
[19:06] <mgz> retrieve by not assigning
[19:07] <LeoNerd> Yah.. I'll try that, thnaks
[19:07] <LeoNerd> ... now all I need to do is work out how to wrap  p4 change  and obtain the new OCL number
[19:07] <mgz> I'd use a prefix just so you're double-sure not to clash with other config keys :)
[19:08] <LeoNerd> Sure
