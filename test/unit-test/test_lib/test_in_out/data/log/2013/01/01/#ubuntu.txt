[00:01] <KxTwo> room seems kind of dead
[00:01] <daftykins> it's almost like it's NEW YEARS
[00:01] <Borillion> LOL
[00:01] <William9455> LOL yes it is Happy New Year
[00:02] <William9455> Sadly though still having issus with linux and software updater
[00:02] <William9455> Maybe my computer should start drinking then it can be a great new year
[00:02] <KxTwo> Not everyone celebrates or cares about NEW YEARS lol
[00:03] <William9455> See it is a new year, but nothing new ever happens same old stuff every year
[00:03] <KxTwo>  New years is just a western thing.  People use it as another excuse to get drunk and be stupid aka basically act like they do every other day
=== LordOfTime is now known as TheLordOfTime
[00:03] <William9455> LOL well I am from WI and they do not need excuses to drink
[00:04] <William9455> and in easter calanders it is not a new year, yet.
[00:04] <William9455> But they do celebrate their new year, like china has thirs and they get drunk there too
[00:05] <daftykins> KxTwo: true, but in my eyes it stops randomers asking for things for just a day or two a year in channels like this ;)
[00:06] <KxTwo> daftykins, if you dont want to be asked of anything simply log out?
[00:06] <daftykins> lol don't be a nob
[00:06] <KxTwo> I love some peoples logic lol
[00:06] <KxTwo> a nob?  LMFAO
[00:06] <William9455> Well maybe it does, this is a free support, if you want 24 365 supportthen that usually costs ya, shouldnt complain just say oh well life goes on, read up your problem on google usually helps me whn I can not get an answer here
[00:06] <daftykins> no my logic is thinking of others :)
[00:06] <daftykins> William9455: true that :)
[00:07] <Gnea> William9455: this is a channel, not a room.
[00:08] <William9455> This is a "free" os but that does not mean support is always there, sometimes have to bit the bit and read up on your topic yourself, I know google has a translate so you can see the help files in native laguange
[00:08] <KxTwo> granted this is support but its also a discussion channel, I've come here plenty of times not really needing support but just trying to educate myself by asking questions.  Like currently trying to understand the different DE's and WM etc.  If some one doesn't want to discuss or answer questions they can simply not respond or log out.  Not really a complex idea.
[00:08] <Gnea> okay, do any of you have anything on topic to ask or discuss?

[00:09] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  it's ubuntu-specific support chan, though
[00:09] <Gnea> William9455: then do so in #ubuntu-offtopic please
[00:09] <bazhang> KxTwo, its NOT the chat channel
[00:09] <William9455> Sorry
[00:09] <KxTwo> NewWorld, ive not asked anything not related to ubuntu.
[00:09] <NewWorld> oh ok
[00:10] <bazhang> KxTwo, this is support only. #ubuntu-discuss or #ubuntu-offtopic for chit chat
[00:10] <KxTwo> NewWorld, my comment was in response to some one saying they liked new years because it meant people wouldnt ask questions.  I thought that was silly.
[00:11] <NewWorld> maybe the mods are out celebrating, so we CAN chit chat hehe
[00:11] <William9455> Not quite it was more about this is quiet and you said well just because it is new years it should not be quiet, then i went off on my tangent sorry of topic again
[00:11] <daftykins> aka this guy can't take a joke ^_^

[00:11] <ubottu> Ubuntu is a complete Linux-based operating system, freely available with both community and professional support. It is developed by a large community and we invite you to participate too! - Also see http://www.ubuntu.com
[00:11] <KxTwo> Anyway my last question relating to ubuntu was involving unity.  I am a little confused I thought unity was a windows manager for gnome but obviously wrong.  When I do ech desktop environment it just says ubuntu.
[00:12] <daftykins> bazhang: that was pretty sad
[00:12] <bazhang> KxTwo, its a shell, just as gnome-shell is
[00:12] <Gnea> KxTwo: Unity is a shell
[00:12] <bazhang> daftykins, lets move on please
[00:12] <Kilum> anyone here used a pinnacle dazzle on ubuntu
[00:12] <KxTwo> so unity is a shell for gnome 3.0?
[00:12] <bazhang> correct
[00:13] <Gnea> !unity | KxTwo
[00:13] <ubottu> KxTwo: Unity is the default UI since Ubuntu 11.04.  Unity is a shell for GNOME. see http://unity.ubuntu.com. For a GNOME 2-like experience, see !notunity
[00:13] <Apteryx> Hello! Does someone tested connecting a USB mass storage Android phone to a LiveCD or LiveUSB?
[00:14] <i3ear> I have a big question
[00:14] <i3ear> anyone got the time?
[00:14] <PDun> Apteryx - Mine gets recognized for booting from LiveUSB and recognized when loaded
[00:14] <Apteryx> Or could make a quick test? I can't make it work. No USB connection is detected. I wonder if it's hardware related or just a general limitation?
[00:15] <Gnea> !ask | i3ear
[00:15] <ubottu> i3ear: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[00:15] <NewWorld> Apteryx:  is it not listed in `lsusb`?
[00:15] <Apteryx> PDun: oh. So it works? You can activate USB storage and copy files from phone to LiveUSB? Which version of Ubuntu are you using?
[00:15] <KxTwo> what eversion of gnome am I running.  The gnome-about command does not seem to exist
[00:15] <i3ear> I am a musician and I have just one program that I need in windows, but it is really important. Can I run virtual midi connections from linux through vm ware to windows and then back again for audio?
[00:16] <Wulfe> are you sure the android "live usb drive" it is in host mode and not OTG mode.
[00:16] <PDun> I am on 10.04 but also worked with 11.10
[00:16] <Apteryx> NewWorld: PDun ok, thanks.
[00:16] <nipar> I "started ubuntuing" just recently, and for that purpose I decided to hang out here
[00:17] <nipar> and now all I can think is, why is linux/ubuntu good? :l
[00:17] <nipar> There
[00:17] <Apteryx> NewWorld: nothing seems to happen when I plug the phone by USB to LiveUSB. No USB connection menu appears in the Android notification area and lsusb does not list the phone :(
[00:17] <nipar> are limitations in software and all kinds of weird things going on
[00:18] <josefwu> i3ear you prolly can pull that off with wine
[00:18] <NewWorld> Apteryx:  do `dmesg`. Unplug/replug it. do `dmesg` again, and see what it told you
[00:18] <KxTwo> ugh so confusing
[00:18] <Wulfe> Apteryx:  are you sure it is in host mode and not OTG mode.
[00:18] <i3ear> josefwu: I am not sure how stable this program is on wine, it is a very uncommon program to run on linux
[00:18] <i3ear> josefwu: that and I could never figure out how wine works :x
[00:18] <Apteryx> Wulfe: hmm, how can I check this? By default I think it would be in host mode?
[00:19] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  can you not find out the gnome version in your package manager?
[00:19] <josefwu> i3ear what program is it?
[00:20] <KxTwo> NewWorld, im not sure how, I simly did a google search and everything talks about the shell but not the version of gnome itself.  I thought I read somewhere that gnome 3.2 would be mroe up my alley but I dont knwo if it means the shell or the DE
[00:20] <Apteryx> NewWorld: Just tried the dmesg, unplug-replug, dmesg and nothing new is printed there :|
[00:20] <Wulfe> well iirc you want it in OTG mode which is usually default. but Host mode makes other things the "drive/peripheral"
[00:20] <i3ear> josefwu: I could but I could never get it to work. but meh I have yet to install linux as lubuntu was giving me problems. I came here to ask for help about it but now I am thinking about just getting rid of windows xp
[00:21] <KxTwo> !notunity
[00:21] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[00:21] <i3ear> josefwu: sorry I didn't see your message, it is abox2 https://sites.google.com/site/analogbox2/
[00:21] <Wulfe> OTG mode or "on the go" mode is what makes it allowable to have it as a drive. that kind of information will be found th the devices manufacture information.
[00:21] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  well open up synaptic and search for gnome and check it's version
[00:21] <Apteryx> Wulfe: I'm pretty sure it's in the correct mode by default, because on a real, as in installed opposed to Live version of Ubuntu, it would get detected and mounted easily without doing anything special (other than activating USB memory access from the notification area in Android)
[00:22] <KxTwo> NewWorld, I dont have synaptic
[00:22] <Wulfe> okay then it is most definitely in OTG mode.
[00:23] <Wulfe> Apteryx: is the BIOS detecting it as a USB HDD?
[00:23] <Apteryx> hum, I can check
[00:23] <Wulfe> you may have to set it up in the BIOS first on some machines
[00:23] <Wulfe> before USB drives can be booted from
[00:23] <NewWorld> KxTwo:  then with dpkg , check `man dpkg` on how to search for a pkg
[00:24] <Apteryx> Wulfe: I'm not sure you got my scenario right, I'm booting Ubuntu from a USB key (distinct from phone) and trying to access my Nexus S internal memory from there
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest86144
[00:24] <Wulfe> OH! yes i did have you wrong.
[00:25] <Apteryx> No problem :D
[00:25] <Wulfe> I thoughtyou had a ubuntu usblive partioned off on the device and wanted to use it to boot ubuntu
[00:25] <Wulfe> my bad
[00:25] <Wulfe> lol
[00:25] <nmatrix9> Hey guys
[00:25] <KxTwo> NewWorld, I think its pointless
[00:25] <KxTwo> i guess ill just try gnome shell
[00:25] <Apteryx> No, it's should be a really simple scenario, it puzzles me as to why it's not working already ;)
[00:26] <nmatrix9> Anyone know of any software to turn my linux box into a hub/router so my NAS and other devices can share my linux box internet connection which is wireless?
[00:27] <Guest86144> hi ubuntu users
[00:27] <PDun> nmatrix - Wired?
[00:27] <PDun> Hi Guest86144
[00:27] <nmatrix9> linux box is connected wirelessly
[00:27] <nmatrix9> all other devices are wired connected to a switch which is then connected to the linux box
[00:28] <nmatrix9> PDun, ^
[00:28] <PDun> Are you using crossover cable to connect from the nic to the switch?
[00:28] <Guest86144> i have a problem with nautilus, i want to hide files names in thumbnail view of pictures. how?
[00:28] <nmatrix9> PDun, no
[00:29] <PDun> Than that is likely your issue:-)
[00:29] <Wulfe> Apteryx:  it should be listed in 'lsusb' and i would assume 'dmesg' would have reported something about it when it was plugged in. otherwise idk. have you tried asking about it in the Galaxy S threads on XDA?
[00:29] <nmatrix9> PDun, Oh
[00:30] <Wulfe> This may very well be a thing on the devices side and not ubuntu
[00:30] <Gnea> KxTwo: you could also try E17, they finally made a release
[00:31] <KxTwo> Gnea, im nto familiar with that?
[00:31] <Gnea> !e17
[00:31] <ubottu> Enlightenment (or "E") is a window manager for X, providing a useful, and good looking graphical shell in which to work. E17 is the current development version.
[00:31] <Gnea> KxTwo: www.enlightenment.org is the site, there's a ppa with all of the latest builds
[00:32] <KaiSforza> e17 is no longer the 'development' version
[00:32] <mec> i just installed ubuntu 12. on my acer laptop. I noticed that if i unplug my power cord and plug it back into the laptop. the lights on the laptop keep blinking. and its not charging the laptop. how do i fix this
[00:32] <PDun> nmatrix9, Another good option would be just using a wireless repeater that gives you a wired output if you need wired connections
[00:33] <broken> !gnome3
[00:33] <ubottu> GNOME 3 is the desktop environment on which Unity is based.  To use GNOME Shell instead of Unity, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool". GNOME 3 is not supported under Natty/11.04, and may break your system if installed from alternate sources.

[00:51] <hectron> Hey all, I need assistance setting up Drupal on Apache locally in Ubuntu 12.10.
[00:51] <jhutchins_wk> mec: The bios handles things like suspend and power management.
[00:51] <jhutchins_wk> mec: The software just interfaces with bios functions.
[00:51] <hectron> I have installed apache and I have configured my virtualhosts. However, I can't access the website from foobar.dev
[00:51] <Nirvash> hectron, sounds intense. Have you tried Google?
[00:52] <mec> i guess i'll have to look. if they even have any for this laptop its a few years old
[00:52] <cjae> when you leave a persistence space on a live usb, where do you save you files or can it be anywhere on the disk, I used unetbootin
[00:52] <jhutchins_wk> mec: You want to start with the latest bios first, the work on tweaking the apci.
[00:52] <hectron> I have enabled that in my /etc/hosts file, and also name the appropriate sites-available/foobar file.
[00:52] <Nirvash> cjae: Persistent space should stay static, so anywhere in that area should be okay. Double check it to be sure.
[00:52] <jhutchins_wk> mec: A lot of systems will have an update that posts around the time the units start hitting the retail market.
[00:52] <cjae> Nirvash: ok thanks
[00:52] <hectron> Furthermore, I have restart the service several times and have ensured that ServerName and ServerAlias are configured to accept foobar.dev as the url.
[00:53] <Nirvash> cjae: Np, let us know
[00:53] <jhutchins_wk> mec: Acer's good about maintaining them.
[00:53] <hectron> Any pointers would be great. Nirvash, I used bing.
[00:53] <Nirvash> hectron: I don't know anything about what you're talking about, but have you seen this?
[00:53] <Nirvash> http://drupal.org/project/apachesolr
[00:53] <hectron> I have seen that before.
[00:54] <jhutchins_wk> hectron: Check your nsswitch file to be sure that the hosts file is the first source for everything.
[00:54] <Nirvash> hectron: Sorry, that's all I know =/
[00:54] <hectron> What is distressing about my situation is that my website is accessible via localhost/foobar but not via foobar.dev as I have set up in my virtualhosts and the /etc/apache2/sites-available/foobar file.
[00:55] <hectron> jhutchins_wk: Thanks for the tip. I will look into that.

[01:36] <OpenSorce> Wow... I just noticed the lack of the word "Linux" on most of Ubuntu's pages on ubuntu.com. A bit presumptuous I think....
[01:37] <Nirvash> OpenSorce: Ubuntu isn't Linux. It's Ubuntu. It's *never* been Linux. @_@ Do not question the Ubuntu overlords.

[01:43] <bluezone> My mouse sensitivity and acceleration are both set to the lowest possible in the 'mouse and touchpad' settings yet my mouse speed is still too FAST, is there any way to decrease them further?
[01:45] <Nirvash> What kind of mouse?
[01:45] <bluezone> Nirvash, it's a dell but i have the problem with every mouse i use, and i've also had the same problem in the past :P
[01:46] <bluezone> i just like very slow mouse sensitivity
[01:46] <Nirvash> Are you sure that it is accepting the settings? Have you looked for the values in terminal?
[01:46] <bluezone> no i haven't looked at the values, i don't know how
[01:46] <Nirvash> Hmm... give me a second
[01:47] <bluezone> Nirvash, but it does seem to be responding when i increase the values :)

[01:47] <bluezone> x0auser, you mean howto change your resolution?
[01:49] <x0auser> no, when i use the old version of the driver i can have the 1920*1200 resolution but when i update it i can only get 1920*1080 so the screen is pushed into the left

[01:51] <x0auser> installing the new driver and pasting the old xorg.conf will do it ?
[01:52] <dr_willis> actually you tried just not using an xorg.conf at all>

[01:56] <Philippa_> I'm just getting my ARM chromebook set up, am I totally SOL re Dropbox?
[01:56] <KM0201> why would you be totally SOL Philippa_ ?
[01:56] <Philippa_> KM0201: apparently I have no source for the nautilus-dropbox package
[01:57] <alcaprawn> what drivers, do i need to install for ati hd6870? the ones from ubuntu-repo messed up my system.
[01:57] <KM0201> are you just using the "free" dropbox?
[01:57] <HackinBlack> is there a way to disable grub so i can boot right into windows. Reason is i need to send laptop in for a repair and they cant see ubuntu
[01:57] <Philippa_> not sure what you mean: I'm trying to grab the one the Software Center offers
[01:57] <KM0201> HackinBlack: if the laptop is being "repaired".. they're going to "see" ubuntu.
[01:58] <melkor> Broke my system is there a way to reconfigure my graphics card and xorg and such?
[01:58] <Philippa_> Dropbox themselves don't appear to offer ARM binaries (unless you're running Android or iOS, anyway)

[01:58] <HackinBlack> I dont care if they see it i just need grub disabled. Ill take my chances dont feel like installing windows and everything just for a repair
[01:58] <KM0201> Philippa_: dunno
[01:58] <OerHeks> HackinBlack, use your windows cd to "repair" your mbr, and change it back after you get it back with a live cd
[01:58] <Philippa_> KM0201: yeah, I was wondering if there's a known/documented reason for that basically. If relevant, I'm on Precise
[01:58] <HackinBlack> Oerheks how whats the command im in windows right now
[01:59] <Philippa_> (and I'm assuming others're potentially going to see this: if you dunno, you dunno)
[01:59] <KM0201> i dunno Philippa_ .. i know there was some probs w/ Dropbox and Ubuntu in previous versions.. so i just switched to UbuntuOne... problem solved
[01:59] <OerHeks> HackinBlack, with your cd? at the point 'install windows' you have an option to repair
[01:59] <KM0201> plus, if you have a free account, you get more space
[02:00] <Philippa_> heh, does UbuntuOne have 'dows and 'droid support? (which is to say, I think I'm SOL, anyway)
[02:00] <HackinBlack> Alright oerheks ill look into it
[02:00] <KM0201> Philippa_: not sure to be honest
[02:00] <melkor> My screen, graphics card and input device could not be detected correctly. I removed some packages I shouldn't have, then reinstalled them and I now have the same error.

[02:01] <KM0201> https://one.ubuntu.com/downloads/
[02:01] <melkor> It is a screen with an ok button that I cannot click because I have no input devices. I can however change ttys which is how I got here.

[02:02] <jamie_> Could someone help me please?
[02:02] <dr_willis> jamie_:  with?
[02:03] <jamie_> I'm following the official xampp's website about installing the gzipped xampp
[02:03] <jamie_> But I don't know what it's asking me to do.
[02:03] <jamie_> It's telling me to use tar xvfz (filename) -C /opt but the terminal is telling me the dir doesn't exist.
[02:03] <dr_willis> jamie_:  i would say make the /opt/ directory then?
[02:03] <jamie_> It exists.
[02:04] <dr_willis> then you are doing a typo would be guess #2.
[02:04] <jamie_> http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-linux.html#374
[02:04] <jamie_> That's the site.
[02:04] <dr_willis> and most likely you need to be root to write in the /opt/ dir.
[02:04] <jamie_> I'm root, I just rooted myself with sudo su
[02:04] <dr_willis> You really shoul dbe using the ubuntu lampp stuff i belive. Not xampp anyway if you want support in here.
[02:04] <OerHeks> use lamp, xampp is bad
[02:05] <dr_willis> dont use 'sudo su' either.. sudo -i or sudo -s
[02:05] <dr_willis> !sudo
[02:05] <ubottu> sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[02:05] <dr_willis> !lamp
[02:05] <ubottu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process.
[02:05] <jamie_> I'll read that instead.

[02:39] <El-E-Va-Tion> that's great, what version of ubuntu do you run?
[02:39] <El-E-Va-Tion> I should probably just run 12.04, it would be a lot easier for compatibility
[02:39] <dr_willis> I always use the latest release normally.
[02:39] <dr_willis> it depends on the age of your hardware.
[02:39] <El-E-Va-Tion> a lot of people have had problems after they upgraded 12.10
[02:39] <El-E-Va-Tion> the laptop is a 2012 model
[02:39] <dr_willis> if your Hardware came out after 12.04 was released  i bet 12.10 would run better
[02:39] <El-E-Va-Tion> in this case it doesn't run at all
[02:39] <dr_willis> I always do clean installs. very few issues with 12.10 at all.

[04:09] <Ransom85> I'm sorry, what is on the ubuntu front page is offtopic for ubuntu?
[04:09] <MoL0ToV> IdleOne, what is the countdown for?
[04:10] <Ransom85> this is directly relevant to ubuntu
[04:10] <IdleOne> MoL0ToV: again, off topic, but there will be an announcement made on the 2nd jan

[04:20] <dr_willis> kujablak:  same as if they were wired.. it dosent matter. What OS is on each pc matters
[04:20] <IdleOne> wanfuse: what does that have to do with Ubuntu?
[04:20] <wanfuse> verisign wants 230 bucks for theres..wondering what the difference is
[04:20] <kujablak> dr_willis, one on ubuntu other one on mint
[04:20] <wanfuse> installing it on a ubuntu server thats all
[04:20] <IdleOne> right, but not an ubuntu issue is it

[04:31] <MonkWitDaFunk> does samba use secure shell?
[04:31] <Ganymede> Okay, thanks all for the help, I'm just going to give up because it's taking up too much time and effort.
[04:32] <Ganymede> MonkWitDaFunk: No, Samba uses the SMB/CIFS (Server message block / Common Internet file system) protocol or the SMB2 protocol.
[04:32] <beandog> although
[04:32] <trisquel> hola
[04:32] <beandog> strictly speaking, you COULD tunnel it over SSH
[04:32] <beandog> but, that'd be insane.
[04:33] <phiberoptik> Bonsoir :)
[04:33] <MonkeyDust> Ganymede  CIFS is similar to NF, not to samba
[04:33] <MonkeyDust> NSF*
[04:33] <MonkWitDaFunk> that would be.the new standard eh.
[04:33] <beandog> Ganymede: what are you trying to do?
[04:33] <Ganymede> MonkWitDaFunk: Of course, in the sense that CIFS and SMB are protocols while Samba is a software package.
[04:33] <phiberoptik> ubuntu-fr?
[04:34] <Ganymede> beandog: Don't worry about it, I already gave up. But I was trying to get a MySQL 4.1 server up and running without doing too much tinkering, hoping some Ubuntu version had in the repos out-of-the-box.
[04:34] <MonkWitDaFunk> what software.uses secure shell?
[04:34] <Ganymede> (Well...old-releases.ubuntu.com isn't out of the box, but whatever).
[04:34] <MonkeyDust> Ganymede  no, SMB (samba) is a protocol too
[04:34] <beandog> Ganymede: oh, yah ... you need TurnKey Linux.  Install, done.
[04:34] <beandog> And it's ubuntu
[04:34] <ivotkl> anyone knows about blinking cursor when selecting XP on GRUB2? It won't go past that point.
[04:34] <dr_willis> MySQL4.x is like real real old isent it?
[04:35] <beandog> yes.
[04:35] <beandog> 5.0 is old
[04:35] <beandog> 5.1 is old.
[04:35] <Ganymede> beandog: Ah, that's good to know, I never actually noticed it wasn't capitalized.
[04:35] <beandog> Ganymede: http://www.turnkeylinux.org/mysql
[04:35] <Ganymede> MonkeyDust: So again, you're just repeating what I'm saying.
[04:35] <OerHeks> 6.10 or 7.04 feisty, dr_willis
[04:35] <Ganymede> MonkeyDust: SMB is a protocol, Samba is not.
[04:35] <dr_willis> distrowatch site didenen even list any with mysql that old. ;)
[04:35] <phiberoptik> link to ubuntu-fr please

[04:36] <Ganymede> beandog: Okay, I should clarify that "out-of-the-box" wasn't the important part, but "4.1" was.
[04:36] <ivotkl> anyone?
[04:37] <beandog> Ganymede: 4.1? o.O
[04:37] <chaospsychex> can someone help me determine if ubuntu is loading the VESA driver because I can't get high resolutions...
[04:37] <dr_willis> ivotkl:  either the xp install is broken. or grub is using the wrong options to boot it.
[04:37] <beandog> someone help ivotkl
[04:37] <beandog> I'm going home
[04:37] <ivotkl> XD
[04:37] <ivotkl> Thanks.
[04:37] <Ganymede> beandog: Yeah, was trying to recover MYI/MYD files from a really old server for which I only have filesystem access.
[04:38] <dr_willis> id try fixing the xp bootloader and get it working first. then reinstall grub after you confirm xp works
[04:38] <ivotkl> I have tried many things with elfy on private chat and I've also tried Repair Boot. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2100140
[04:38] <ivotkl> Nothing worked.
[04:38] <beandog> Ganymede: Hmm
[04:38] <beandog> Ganymede: lemme think for a second
[04:38] <ivotkl> I'll edit the post with some outputs
[04:38] <dr_willis> its possible the issue is with XP
[04:38] <dr_willis> not with grub/ubuntu
[04:38] <beandog> Ganymede: You should be able to read it with 5.0
[04:38] <Ganymede> beandog: Well...I'm not going to do any more work on this because I already exhausted my time and effort so don't worry about it. I don't want to think about this during the new years.
[04:38] <ivotkl> Darn, so how do I fix it?
[04:38] <dr_willis> id try fixing the xp bootloader and get it working first. then reinstall grub after you confirm xp works
[04:38] <beandog> Ganymede: also, try loading it, and then running mysql_upgrade
[04:39] <OerHeks> ivotkl, is it a sata disk, and did you change ide mode to AHCI ?
[04:39] <kujablak> dr_willis, that's what I get : connect to host 192.168.1.103 port 22: Connection refused
[04:39] <dr_willis> kujablak:  you installed ssh server on the machine you are sshing to?
[04:39] <chaospsychex> i can't select 1280x1024 which is the highest resolution my monitor supports.....
[04:39] <ivotkl> Lemme check, I did a change for it to load XP cd or it wouldn't let me go on. It gave me a BSOD.
[04:39] <ivotkl> just a sec.
[04:39] <kujablak> dr_willis, yes
[04:40] <dr_willis> kujablak:  go to that machine and see if you can 'ssh localhost' to verify ssh is working
[04:40] <OerHeks> ivotkl, if you change it back, you cannot load ubuntu anymore, probably grub also
[04:41] <beandog> Ganymede: happy new year's buddy!  Take a break. :)
[04:42] <Ganymede> beandog: Thanks.
[04:42] <ivotkl> I know Oerheks.
[04:42] <chaospsychex> ubuntu 12.04 is incorrectly reading the EDID of my monitor, why ?
[04:42] <MonkWitDaFunk> i need help. if i have six sata disks hooked up to one board which is always going to boot ubuntu, are there any examples where not all six sata disks were not.formatted to the ext4 filesystem? i need help.
[04:43] <chaospsychex> omg
[04:43] <beandog> wait what?
[04:43] <chaospsychex> spin the barrel on your .38
[04:43] <beandog> I just ... what?
[04:43] <ivotkl> chaospychex: sometimes not reaching maximum resolution is related to  drivers. can you go to pastebin.com or some similar site you know and give us the output of sudo lshw -c video and lspci |grep OpenGL?
[04:44] <ivotkl> Do you have video card drivers installed? Are they proprietary or open source?
[04:44] <dr_willis> MonkWitDaFunk:  what FS to use.. depens on what you want to do with the disks.
[04:44] <OerHeks> !format
[04:44] <ubottu> For help with partitioning a new install see: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/i386/partitioning.html - For partitioning programs see !GParted, !QtParted (!Kubuntu 8.10 and lower) or !PartitionManager (!Kubuntu 9.04 and up) - Other partitioning topics include !fstab !home and !swap
[04:44] <dr_willis> MonkWitDaFunk:  you could use any FS you wanted on whatever partion you want.
[04:44] <chaospsychex> ivotkl: integrated intel video gpu
[04:45] <jagginess> chaospsychex, that comes with the kernel.. to upgrade that driver you merely upgrade the kernel :)
[04:45] <chaospsychex> ivotkl: i have no proprietary drivers installed and none are available
[04:45] <MonkWitDaFunk> ok. i.got confused because somebody told.me to keep all sata disks.the same.filesystem
[04:45] <KxTwo> any opinions on lxde vs xfce?
[04:45] <beandog> what??
[04:45] <beandog> MonkWitDaFunk: that's bs
[04:45] <chaospsychex> jagginess: i shouldn't have to upgrade to a newer kernel to get ubuntu to correctly determine my monitor's EDID, 12.04
[04:46] <ivotkl> what is EDID? XD
[04:46] <dr_willis> MonkWitDaFunk:  the partitions have filesystems.. not the disk.
[04:46] <ivotkl> !EDID
[04:46] <MonkWitDaFunk> thats right
[04:46] <jagginess> chaospsychex, you can use the update software app and have checkmarked anything with 'updates'..
[04:46] <kujablak> dr_willis, ssh localhost tells me that the authenticity cannot be established, should I continue ?
[04:46] <ivotkl> bot does not know a thing about it =P
[04:46] <chaospsychex> ivotkl: if you don't know what EDID is then you can't assist me
[04:46] <OerHeks> KxTwo, lxde needs min 256 mb and xfce needs min 512 mb system memory
[04:46] <dr_willis> MonkWitDaFunk:  now the  type of disk - gpt cs msdos may matter.
[04:46] <ivotkl> hahaha, ok =P
[04:46] <jagginess> chaospsychex, not sure for 12.04, but here on 12.10 i can get kernel 3.5
[04:46] <KxTwo> OerHeks, I have 4gb
[04:47] <chaospsychex> jagginess: LOL ok.....
[04:47] <beandog> ivotkl: it's basically the monitor telling the computer what resolutions it supports.
[04:47] <dr_willis> kujablak:  thats normal for the first connection
[04:47] <jagginess> chaospsychex, systemtools/administration/softwareupdater
[04:47] <dr_willis> kujablak:  DO you want to continue? :)
[04:47] <chaospsychex> beandog: can you assist me ?
[04:47] <chaospsychex> jagginess: no
[04:47] <beandog> chaospsychex: no, I'm about to leave, sorry man
[04:47] <kujablak> dr_willis, I did, and it said Write failed: Broken pupe
[04:47] <kujablak> dr_willis, pipe*
[04:48] <dr_willis> kujablak:  thats unusual that ssh localhost would ever fail.
[04:48] <chaospsychex> beandog: you can't leave, your the only one in here who knows what EDID is....:-(
[04:48] <jagginess> chaospsychex, no what?
[04:48] <dr_willis> kujablak:  you got any other weird settings/setup on those machines?
[04:48] <jagginess> chaospsychex, edid is data information reported back from the monitor
[04:48] <jagginess> chaospsychex, intel releases patches to kernel.org
[04:48] <chaospsychex> jagginess: yes, why should i have to upgrade to a newer kernel? that is madness....
[04:48] <jagginess> chaospsychex, it is part of the kernel package
[04:48] <kujablak> dr_willis, don't think so, I did the localhost on mint, and I just installed it
[04:48] <jagginess> chaospsychex, (i said it 5 minutes ago)
[04:48] <chaospsychex> jagginess: madness
[04:49] <dr_willis> kujablak:  no idea on mint. could be firewall or other silly things mint does. try on the ubuntu box
[04:49] <jagginess> chaospsychex, bye kid.

[04:54] <jagginess> ivotkl, just ignore him like i did.. he's mocked me too when helping him..
[04:54] <chaospsychex> ivotkl: not mocking, you asked about modules not loading...
[04:54] <red_> If anyone is willing to help me troubleshoot Ubuntu install through UEFI on my new desktop please message me. I have tried a couple techniques listed on the boards.
[04:54] <lobhater> no internal intel.  i have fixed it before but cant remember which file i added it too. iwlwifi is the driver
[04:54] <chaospsychex> or trying to prevent a certain module from loading
[04:55] <jagginess> red_, you have your efi on "strict efi" or "hybrid bios" ?
[04:55] <jagginess> red_,  (check your efi/bios settings)
[04:55] <red_> i disabled secure
[04:55] <chaospsychex> ivotkl: you can blacklist the module you don't won't loading at boot
[04:55] <red_> And booted usb through efi
[04:55] <red_> I think I fucked up partitioning
[04:55] <jagginess> red_, yeah.. but is the "efi/bios" set on "strict efi" or "hybrid bios" ?
[04:55] <jagginess> red_, dont worry about partitioning atm..
[04:56] <jagginess> red_, tell me the motherboard i can see if its mentioned the default in the manual..

[04:58] <lobhater> whne using grep is there a way to have it NOT display "error" messages. like "not a file or directory" or "permission denied" even when running as root?
[04:58] <lobhater> only display positive results
[05:00] <lobhater> # grep -rl "iwlwifi" /etc         and only display hits

[05:06] <red_> I switched from 12.10 down to 12.04
[05:06] <jagginess> red_, perhaps if there's an "Advanced" option in the bios? just be sure you check any "advanced settings" and anything to do with "strict efi" or "Hybrid bios" <<
[05:06] <KxTwo> red_, I just did that as well.  12.10 was giving me problems
[05:06] <jagginess> red_, boot-up from cd only?
[05:07] <jagginess> red_, (I mean you can boot up from cd only?)
[05:08] <red_> I am booting from usb. I didnt have any cds. The installation isnt recognizing any partition. However the partioner is started its just hanging.

[05:39] <OerHeks> HaiKaiDo, only Quantal 12.10, Precise 12.04 & beta-Raring 13.04
[05:40] <HaiKaiDo> I did know that it said only 12.04 and above, but i spoke with someone in here a few days ago that said as long as i had adb and fastboot running on my distro (which i do) the package would install
[05:40] <HaiKaiDo> can i add the ppa for 12.04 on my current 10.04?

[05:44] <HaiKaiDo> whats it like?
[05:44] <HaiKaiDo> also, gnome-fallback?
[05:44] <HaiKaiDo> will that allow me to use gnome 2.0/gtk themes?
[05:44] <jagginess> yeah.. gnome-fallback is like mate-desktop
[05:45] <jagginess> It's gnome3 but in fallback/classic mode..
[05:45] <HaiKaiDo> ahh
[05:45] <jagginess> there's about 2 ways of enabling it.. (there's full of easy 2 steps on how to do it)
[05:45] <HaiKaiDo> will it let me use legacy gtk themes?
[05:45] <jagginess> one way is using dconf..
[05:45] <jagginess> dunno..
[05:46] <jagginess> you'll have to check out all that stuff.. i just like the traditional panel bars and startmenu

[06:33] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1079259 in testdrive (Ubuntu) "not lintian clean" [Undecided,Incomplete]
[06:35] <lobhater> anyone any good with grub?\nI installed another distro but now wanna get rid of it, how do i fix grub so it doesnt being up the boot menu and just boots into ubuntu?
[06:37] <jagginess> lobhater, /etc/default/grub  , hidden timeout or something..  << after you make the proper changes to that file, you do sudo update-grub<enter> , then reboot to test
[06:38] <rhet9> hey how can i use the commandline tools, such as apt-get, to search for packages i have installed
[06:38] <jagginess> rhet9, use apt-cache search <string>
[06:38] <lobhater> ok thanks, I am just always so nervous to mess with grub. that is still one black box i have never tackled
[06:38] <rhet9> jagginess, that doesn't show me installed apps
[06:38] <Mechdave> lobhater, As long as you have removed the previous distros you can re install grub from a terminal with grub-install /dev/sr0
[06:38] <rhet9>  it shows me everything
[06:39] <cfhowlett> rhet9: apt-cache policy packagename
[06:39] <jagginess> rhet9, for installed? .. ya.. you can use     dpkg -l |grep string
[06:39] <mvt007geek> lobhater: in my country it's 10 am :D
[06:39] <jagginess> rhet9, "ii" means the package is installed (if you removed a package it wouldn't say ii)
[06:39] <Mechdave> lobhater, after that you can modify the line GRUB_DEFAULT=0 (the first grub entry)
[06:40] <rhet9> i want to remove amazon from unity
[06:40] <Mechdave> lobhater, in the file /etc/default/grub
[06:40] <lobhater> i just formated that partition, so this will work.
[06:40] <lobhater> # grub-install /dev/sda1
[06:40] <rhet9> i like unity but what canonical  is doing to commercialize ubuntu i don't
[06:40] <jagginess> rhet9, try fixing problem #1 first. Then later come to problem#2
[06:40] <rhet9> jagginess, that IS my problem
[06:40] <lobhater> with the 1 or not?
[06:40] <rhet9> and it's not solved
[06:40] <rhet9> mainly because there is no package  named amazon
[06:41] <Mechdave> lobhater, no, use grub-install /dev/sda
[06:41] <jagginess> rhet9, problem #1, find out the package
[06:41] <Mechdave> lobhater, that way grub will install on MBR
[06:41] <jagginess> lobhater, can you tell us what you're trying to do?
[06:42] <lobhater> Mechdave: and i can just do this from a normal terminal i dont need to stop lightdm or anything?
[06:42] <Mechdave> lobhater, just from a normal terminal, you will need to use sudo though
[06:42] <lobhater> i partitioned sda5 that arch was on and now i wanna get grub to the way it was before i installed arch
[06:42] <cfhowlett> rhet9: nothing to remove but you can "disable amazon lens in ubuntu"
=== ken is now known as Guest4761
[06:43] <Mechdave> lobhater, as long as you have removed arch from /dev/sda5 then all should be good
[06:44] <lobhater> Mechdave: thanks. exactly what i needed
[06:44] <Mechdave> lobhater, grub will search your computer and find operating systems to add boot entries for automatically
[06:44] <lobhater> happy new year all, have a good night
[06:45] <Mechdave> lobhater, after you reinstall grub you will need to modify /etc/default/grub if you want it to do anything different from standard

[06:58] <jagginess> MK`, applets? hahaha.. i think they Gnome3 authors are calling it something else
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[06:59] <jagginess> bellundger, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography
[06:59] <average_drifter> jagginess: what's up ?
[06:59] <MK`> well whatever they're called. I made a left panel and added the window list to it and it crashed :P just need to find that and remove it, or just remove the third panel.
[06:59] <jagginess> bellundger, each host has a key-pair.. they only exchange the public keys..
[07:00] <bellundger> how would i implement it though?
[07:00] <average_drifter> MK`: what window manager are you using ?
[07:00] <jagginess> bellundger, when you send a message to someone else.. You encrypt your message using "their" public key..
[07:00] <average_drifter> MK`: remove your window manager, and install i3 instead , then you won't have anymore crashes
[07:00] <MK`> average_drifter: I'm on whatever the gnome fallback is for 11.10.
[07:00] <average_drifter> i3 ==> best and most stable window-manager I've seen in my life
[07:00] <jagginess> bellundger, you cannot "decrypt" your encrypted message using their public key.. because the algorithm is "asymmetric"
[07:01] <average_drifter> MK`: yeah, gnome is a piece of crap, remove it
[07:01] <jagginess> bellundger, which is a "good" thing
[07:01] <MK`> I am aware that gnome sucks, but I am still asking for help :V
[07:01] <MK`> these things are related.
[07:01] <average_drifter> MK`: the easiest way to solve a problem is to get rid of it
[07:01] <bellundger> i'll be generating both keys
[07:01] <average_drifter> MK`: get rid of gnome and you solve the problem
[07:02] <average_drifter> MK`: don't try to be clever, be smart :)
[07:02] <Thundarr> by that logic he should stab you to death right now.
[07:02] <bellundger> just don't know how to go about setting it up in the mail server
[07:02] <average_drifter> Thundarr: no, because I'd remove him from planet earth if he did that
[07:02] <average_drifter> s/did/attempted/
[07:02] <jagginess> bellundger, i believe gpg is meant to be used peer to peer, server-iccentric
[07:03] <jagginess> bellundger, ,/pgp/
[07:03] <Noskcaj> Logan_, nobody can understand what it means
[07:04] <Noskcaj> Logan_, if the average person cannot repeat the bug, it's incomplete
[07:04]  * jagginess has problems saying pgp without thinking gpg
[07:05] <dr_willis> MK`:  you could delete/rename the various config files untill you reset your gnome back to its defaults.
[07:06] <Logan_> Noskcaj: I think that a package maintainer would know what it means… Being lintian clean is important for packages, as it ensures that they meet policy.
[07:06] <average_drifter> Here is another thing to ponder: How in God's name can you trust a mammoth of a window-manager like Gnome ? Why I'm asking this ? It is immense, it's like a huuuUUuuuuUUge pile of code put together, it will have bugs *FOR_SURE*. There is no hope in expecting it to be perfect. In fact, the more code is in there, and the more features , the more imperfect it is, the more buggy it is. Now i3 and wmii are both minimalist window managers. And dwm is ano
[07:07] <Noskcaj> Logan_, yes, but unless you can fix the bug yourself, i dont think much will happen, could you do something to make "normal" people understand it
[07:07] <average_drifter> MK`: sudo aptitude purge gnome gnome2 gnome3
[07:07] <Logan_> Noskcaj: Okay, will do.
[07:07] <average_drifter> MK`: actually just remove
[07:07] <average_drifter> MK`: sudo aptitude remove gnome gnome2 gnome3
[07:08] <dr_willis> best to not use aptitude any more.
[07:08] <average_drifter> dr_willis: orly ? so what is the new thing ?
[07:08] <Logan_> Noskcaj: I attempted to clarify it a bit: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/testdrive/+bug/1079259
[07:08] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1079259 in testdrive (Ubuntu) "not lintian clean" [Undecided,New]
[07:08] <dr_willis> just use apt-get
[07:08] <MK`> dr_willis that's what I'm doing. But, I am unsure where the settings are...
[07:08] <average_drifter> dr_willis: oh ? why is that ?
[07:08] <dr_willis> !aptitude
[07:08] <ubottu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[07:09] <Noskcaj> Logan_, thanks, i will check it then mark it as new again
[07:09] <MK`> the most recent file edited was the clock, which I changed the settings of a few minutes before adding the new panel.
[07:09] <dr_willis> MK`:  make a backup directory. and just move whatever seems gnome related. :)
[07:09] <MK`> ok :P
[07:09] <dr_willis> MK`:  not like its hard to resetup whatever changes you mad
[07:09] <average_drifter> MK`:  ~/.gnome*
[07:10] <average_drifter> dr_willis: the best reset is a removal
[07:10] <dr_willis>  .gnome* .gtk* perhaps just  nautiuls/metacity connfigs would be all needed
[07:10] <MK`> there's no .gnome, only .gconf :P
[07:10] <dr_willis> average_drifter:  the problem is your pacakage removeing will NOT RESET USER SETTINGS...
[07:10] <dr_willis> average_drifter:  so your commands were pointless.

[07:11] <dr_willis> average_drifter:  apt does not touch the settings in the users home directory. so well.. your suggestions are invalid.
[07:11] <bazhang> average_drifter, please dont comment further if you dont know
[07:11] <average_drifter> dr_willis: my suggestions are valid because if you remove gnome then there is *no* *more* panel to get wrong or to cause any error
[07:12] <average_drifter> instead using a tiling window manager can be extremely productive and less of a hassle
[07:12] <average_drifter> that is what I suggested

[07:24] <MK`> Thundarr: 3 years for non-LTS releases.
[07:24] <Thundarr> ah, ok ty. that's still more than enough.
[07:24] <misterno> what is the purpose of having 1499 users in channel when only dozen really talk
[07:24] <MK`> 10.04 and 12.04 are LTS, but 10.11, 11.04, 11.10 are not. it's every 4th release.
[07:25] <average_drifter> misterno: because they need regulations and policies and police and laws here
[07:25] <jagginess> misterno, well why have 50 thousand friends when you only really care for five? It's called facebook..
[07:25] <jagginess> ^
[07:25] <jagginess> :)
[07:25] <average_drifter> misterno: didn't you know there's a Ubuntu Supreme court ?
[07:25] <topper4125> jagginess, that's what I heard too. I was on their website, looks like everything ships with 12.10 (for now)... curious to know if I could request a machine with latest LTS instead though... they come with some PPA's they manage, and a few other goodies that I'm not sure if I formatted and reinstalled 12.04, i would be able to 'get' without a lot of problems
[07:25] <misterno> is this overcompensating in numbers for lack of something else? :)
[07:26] <average_drifter> misterno: you have a point .. I must say
[07:26] <jagginess> topper4125, it's not to worry.. you shouldn't have a problem tailoring it to your particular needs..
[07:27] <MK`> I must say, I was surprised I didn't have dconf-tools installed. I thought it was default.
[07:27] <jagginess> topper4125, there's video interviews of managers/etc-- they work with canonical..
[07:27] <topper4125> jagginess, I'll have to look into that... thanks!
[07:27] <MK`> Also, how do I make a program in the terminal get pushed up into 'my' terminal again? I forgot.
[07:28] <jagginess> MK`, i dunno about tmux or asimilar, but I use "screen -RR" everytime
[07:28] <jagginess> MK`, (ssh)
[07:28] <kylescottmcgill> Does anyone know if i disable Gnome-Keyring etc, will it break all my other gnome-control-center stuff namely wifi + misc ?
[07:28] <MK`> kylescottmcgill: pretty sure that'd break wifi
[07:28] <dr_willis> kylescottmcgill:  why disable it?
[07:28] <average_drifter> MK`: just grep through the 99999 configuration files in .gconf  and find the right xml with the terminal .. probably ..
[07:28] <jagginess> kylescottmcgill, probably not.. but it will break your computer's heart
[07:29] <dr_willis> MK`:  Backgrouind jobs? bg/fg commands perhaps
[07:29] <jagginess> pretty helpless average_drifter!
[07:30] <elky> average_drifter, your snark is not welcome here.
[07:30] <kylescottmcgill> dr_willis: im using Awesome WM, and everytime i go to start anything i have to sudo prior to opening it so that it can use Gnome-Keyring, also i cant really start it as its embedded into lightgdm startup process, so its either i remove lightgdm and replace it with slim, and use a .xinitrc file, or i disable gnome-keyring and fend for myself etc, i can use wicd for networking but meh
[07:30] <average_drifter> jagginess: useless you say ? https://gist.github.com/6a8d0d36acca59af573e
[07:31] <average_drifter> I already found where the gnome-terminal is placed in the ~/.gconf
[07:31] <dr_willis> hmm.. gnome-keyring asks once here  when it starts up if its not started.. then i never notice it again
[07:31] <kylescottmcgill> jagginess: macbooks have no heart
[07:31] <average_drifter> I highly suspect one can modify the order of items in the menus by just modifying those files
[07:31] <average_drifter> MK`: https://gist.github.com/6a8d0d36acca59af573e
[07:31] <MK`> thanks jagginess that worked
[07:31] <kylescottmcgill> dr_willis: are you using a different WM too ?
[07:31] <MK`> I ran gnome-panel from the terminal, needed to just kick it off the terminal so I could close it X)
[07:32] <dr_willis> kylescottmcgill:  im using 'startx' go launch gnome-shell at the moment. I think its done the same thing with other wm's when i was testing them last month.
[07:32] <dr_willis> MK`:  command & , then use the 'exit' command is one way.
[07:32] <dr_willis> MK`:  or 'ctrl-z' then 'bg' then 'exit'
[07:32] <MK`> ah yes, &. I forgot.
[07:33] <dr_willis> Just hitting the terminal close button can close apps spawned by the terminal. so i always use close.
[07:33] <kylescottmcgill> yeah, see i could use that, the startx .xinitrc approach, but i dont see a way to get that working with lightgdm, not yet anyway
[07:33] <yassination_> hey guys, happy new year, I have a problem... after installing KDE desktop environment my HDMI port can't be detected by ubuntu, even when I use xrandr it's not listed, I need help?
[07:33] <dr_willis> kylescottmcgill:  you could define your own whatevber.desktop session for lightdm to use to run whatever you want.
[07:34] <dr_willis> most of the *dm managers will use the same whatever.desktop definitions.
[07:34] <average_drifter> kylescottmcgill: ^^ dr_willis is right
[07:34] <kylescottmcgill> dr_willis: thanks, i will check that out, there was mention of that on Awesomes wiki, but it was an old entry
[07:34] <dr_willis> Not sure about slim. ive not used it in ages.
[07:34] <average_drifter> kylescottmcgill: I have this file for my wmii for example /usr/share/xsessions/wmii.desktop
[07:34] <average_drifter> kylescottmcgill: and it shows up in the options in lightdm and gdm
[07:34] <kylescottmcgill> awesome, you guys are win, i will check that out now
[07:34] <average_drifter> kylescottmcgill: here's the file format https://github.com/wsdookadr/wmii/blob/master/usr/share/xsessions/wmii.desktop
[07:35] <jagginess> kylescottmcgill, actually it's "lightdm" .. "gdm3" is an equivalent logon option but separate

[07:38] <average_drifter> kylescottmcgill: I settled with i3
[07:38] <kvothetech> i3 isn't bad either.
[07:38] <average_drifter> kvothetech: you like xmonad. May God help you write Haskell to configure it ...
[07:38] <kvothetech> lol it's cool haskell isn't that bad
[07:38] <kvothetech> could be lua like awesome wants lol
[07:38] <average_drifter> right ...
[07:38] <kylescottmcgill> kvothetech: sane here, loved it, but ended up with Awesome, as a lot of other programs i use are based in or use lua, Haskell is pretty big :D
[07:39] <kvothetech> lua is way worse than haskell syntax wise if you ask me
[07:39] <elky> If only we had #ubuntu-offtopic for this not-really-support kind of discussion.
[07:39] <kvothetech> elky: what'd you need support for?
[07:40] <kylescottmcgill> i like lua maybe not over haskell, but its tiny, REALLY terse though
[07:40] <kylescottmcgill> ah
[07:40] <kvothetech> too many parentheses
[07:40] <kylescottmcgill> i mean verbose
[07:40] <elky> kvothetech, i don't, i'm just making sure that people who do need it have space to ask it here.

[08:09] <ubottu> bug 1094997 in testdrive (Ubuntu) "Testdrive-cli only supports ubuntu and ubuntu-server by default" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1094997
[08:10] <Em_> I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my Netbook (Lenovo G480 Intel Core i5, 400GB HDD, 4GB RAM, 1GB GPU). The distro is already installed; however some of the hardware drivers like the GPU, Ethernet, are not automatically installed leaving me unable to connect to the Internet. I really thought that all my notebook's hardware drivers will be installed automatically with the OS, so how do I install it without Internet connection?
[08:11] <bazhang> !offline | Em_
[08:11] <ubottu> Em_: If you need to download Ubuntu packages using another machine or OS, check the desired packages in Synaptic and select File > Generate package download script. Alternatively, try http://ubottu.com/ljl/apt/ - See also !APTonCD
[08:11] <cfhowlett> Em_: depending on the hardware, some offline configuration is possible
[08:12] <cyphase> Happy PST New Year!
[08:12] <Em_> ubottu: sorry, but I don't follow.
[08:12] <ubottu> Em_: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[08:13] <cfhowlett> Em_: I might have the solution for you but you need to do a bit of terminal work ...
[08:13] <Em_> cfhowlett: Would mind giving me the step-by-step solution?
[08:14] <cfhowlett> Em_: open terminal and paste the following:  lspci -vvnn | grep 14e4
[08:15] <dr_willis> Em_:  You mean the Wired networking is not working? or Wireless?
[08:15] <Em_> dr_willis, the wires, the GPU, I don't know the others since I don't know how to determine if the drivers were installed
[08:15] <dr_willis> Em_:  determine your video card (thats what cfhowlett  command will help tell us)
[08:16] <cfhowlett> Em_: I'm on ubuntu studio 12.04, i.e. xubuntu based.  Different from what you're using.  But I THINK you type "terminal" in the search grid and you'll get a terminal
[08:16] <dr_willis> alt-ctrl-t for terminal in unity by default
[08:16] <cfhowlett> Em_: the command I sent will ID your wifi chip
[08:16] <Em_> ok, please give me a moment.
[08:16] <dr_willis> if the Wired chipset is not working.. thats.. somewhat rare.
[08:16] <cfhowlett> Em_: if it's broadcom 43XX we can use this tutorial to bring you online   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xxeme
[08:17] <dr_willis> lspci output will also let us determin your video chipset.
=== DouglasK is now known as DouglasKAway
[08:20] <Em_> Oh ok
[08:21] <cfhowlett> Em_: lspci -vvnn | grep 14e4  HOPEFULLY the output includes "BCM43xx" wirless LAN Controller ...

[08:26] <dr_willis> arabi:  loook in /etc/skel for the original
[08:27] <arabi> dr_willis, can I copy an paste from that?
[08:27] <dr_willis> arabi:  or just  the file to your home.
[08:27] <Em_> cfhowlett: A wireless network is currently unavailable for me, so I'd rather have the wired network or driver installed instead.

[08:28] <dr_willis> .  ..  .bash_logout  .bashrc  examples.desktop  .profile
[08:28] <cfhowlett> Em_: the method I've used doesn't require a network.
[08:28] <cfhowlett> Em_: and the result is a working wifi ...
[08:28] <dr_willis> Em_:  how new is this laptop? if you can determine its wired chipset.  that might make things easier if you can run a cable to it.
[08:29] <dr_willis> its rather unusual for a wired network card to not work.
[08:29] <cfhowlett> dr_willis: should we prioritize the wired and THEN the wireless?
[08:29] <arabi> dr_willis, I have put export PS1="\[\e[28;1m\]\w \[\e[0m\]\$ "   in ~/.profile but not working why?
[08:29] <dr_willis> cfhowlett:  i have to wonder why his wired is not working.
[08:30] <dr_willis> arabi:  you started a new shell?
[08:30] <Em_> How do I determine if the wireless network is installed already?
[08:30] <arabi> yes
[08:30] <cfhowlett> Em_: plug it in to a router.
[08:30] <dr_willis> arabi:  .pofile is read on initial logn i think. try 'source .profile'
[08:30] <Em_> cfhowlett: No, I mean how do I determine if the WiFi driver is already installed along with Ubuntu?
[08:31] <Em_> is there like something like Device Manager like in Windows?
[08:31] <arabi> dr_willis, done boss... not it is working .. thanks and happy newyear
[08:31] <dr_willis> wifi connection tool/icon at the top right of the panels/screen
[08:31] <cfhowlett> Em_: I understood that your networking was completely unavailable.  Not true?
[08:32] <Em_> Uhhm, I think that the wireless adapater is already installed
[08:32] <cfhowlett> Em_: ah ... then we need not mess with that!
[08:32] <Em_> However, there are no available wi-fi network that I can connect to as of the moment. But I can connect to an Ethernet networ. Problem is I can''t connect to it, as I plug the Ethernet cable, it wouldn't recognize it
[08:34] <cfhowlett> Em_: forgive me for confusing the issue.
[08:34] <topper4125> Em_ are you sure the router isn't locked down to the point that even a machine plugged into it will not be allowed on (mac block for example)?
[08:34] <Em_> topper4125: yeah, that is not the case.
[08:35] <Em_> cfhowlett: I think what i need is to install the ethernet port/LAN driver
[08:35] <topper4125> k... its just odd that a hardwired connection doesn't just 'work'...

[09:01] <hackibnblack> I hope they release it that would be sick
[09:02] <topper4125> there are vids of it on youtube... really not impressed myself... but that's just me
[09:02] <theadmin> Well, I have two guesses: Ubuntu for Android or Ubuntu TV
[09:03] <OerHeks> and phone
[09:03] <hackibnblack> Well it's big for ubuntu and I support ubuntu / open source 199%
[09:04] <topper4125> or maybe the're adopting Gubuntu in to the *buntu family (An official release of Ubuntu with the Gnome Desktop?) lol
[09:04]  * cfhowlett thinks "only 199%"?  
[09:05] <theadmin> topper4125: That has nothing to do with "touching". That's obviously a hint
[09:05] <topper4125> I'm actually surprised that hasn't shown up yet on Distrowatch
[09:05] <hackibnblack> Yea only 199%
[09:06] <theadmin> topper4125: Well, gnomebuntu.com has been up for a while
[09:09] <newbie|2> theadmin, just went there.. looks like its under construction gubuntu is up and running, just not listed on distrowatch yet.

[09:20] <ElectricPrism> how do I get to the official linuxmint channel? Is it on this server? I tried joining and got sent to ##linuxmint
[09:21] <nightfly_> ElectricPrism: just a guess, but is your nick registered and authed?
[09:21] <Noskcaj> ElectricPrism, Official support channel is #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[09:22] <ElectricPrism> Noskcaj: Ill try it, im authed for sure. I was hoping to ask their users why they prefer that specific distro should prove an interesting conversation since I can't get into it for some reason
[09:22] <topper4125> Official support channel is #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[09:24] <topper4125> one of the reasons I don't use mint is because of some of the political views of the founder
[09:25] <Thundarr> interesting. like what? have a link I can read up?
[09:25] <ElectricPrism> Their art really was a turnoff for me personally, could never get into their style
[09:26] <topper4125> he's one of those tinfoil hat wearing holocost denying guys... http://jay4rest.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/linux-mint-founder-is-against-israel/
[09:27] <ElectricPrism> fascinating
[09:27] <Thundarr> lol. wow.
[09:27] <Thundarr> yeah that kind of stunts my interest in it.
[09:29] <ElectricPrism> I just dont understand why its @ the top of distrowatch, I have no problem supporting a company that wants to see profit from their creation
[09:29] <Thundarr> israel should officially adopt linux mint as their distro of choice.
[09:29] <Thundarr> heh
[09:30] <ElectricPrism> XD
[09:30] <Thundarr> I'm just trying to decide what to run
[09:30] <Thundarr> word is that win 9 is going even more heavily into the 'tile' crap of 8
[09:31] <topper4125> I have no problem with monitization in linux... with big money comes big developers (steam for example)
[09:31] <ElectricPrism> I'm running Sabayon right now, I like a lot of things about Ubuntu based distros. Thundarr: Yeah, Windows 8 made me officially move to linux, now all I need is photoshop running fairly well so I can continue work for clients
[09:32] <topper4125> I think if steam can show a big profit other software houses like Adobe will follow them
[09:32] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: if adobe followed along with steam I think windows would crumble
[09:32] <topper4125> yup me too! :D
[09:33] <theadmin> topper4125: So far Adobe is doing completely the opposite. They dropped Flash for Linux, for instance.
[09:33] <ElectricPrism> interesting, gotta admit I never was a fan of flash, but the lack of it sucks for sure
[09:34] <theadmin> ElectricPrism: They'll continue to provide security updates for 5 years or something, after that Flash will only be available as part of Google Chrome
[09:34] <theadmin> Mozilla also wokrs on their own Flash implementation
[09:34] <topper4125> Steam said something along the lines of "the future of gaming is *not* in windows"... if that is true... and for as big as gaming is financially... Linux has a huge opertunity to grow.
[09:35] <Thundarr> blah. valve just said all that crap because their own market is going to conflict with windows marketplace.
[09:35] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I agree, I actually foregoe console gaming and own a number of steam games. I just love that on the computer my games will run in all future OS versions unlike PS 1 > PS 2 > PS3 > PS 4, etc...
[09:35] <Malsasa_> Yes, and game platforms are not Steam only :) There are another platform beside Steam :) CMIIW
[09:36] <Thundarr> more games just need to run in a browser like quake live
[09:36] <Thundarr> thats pretty damn awesome cross compatibility there
[09:36] <ElectricPrism> Malsasa_: But I could see Steam deciding to base a open source distro on FreeBSD if they wanted to maintain the base, otherwise yeah they'd just have Canonical handle all the linux work since GPL pretty much forces everyone to open their work up
[09:37] <ElectricPrism> Thundarr: Oh I agree, especially with WebGL games
[09:37] <ElectricPrism> meh #linuxmint-help wasn't that helpful, they just told me to run the livecd and that it was pretty much ubuntu but not explaining how it differed QQ
[09:37] <topper4125> that *is* something M$ has said in the past "the future of computing is 100% cloud, os,apps, data everything. for some reason, that scares me a bit, but it seems that they are trying to make that their future
[09:38] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I think businesses are smarter than trusting the cloud* if not- they'll learn the hard way imo
[09:38] <topper4125> 'tis true ElectricPrism
[09:38] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: plus I would think business owners are control freaks and would like their data stored locally - I wouldn't mind having apps in the cloud, but not my personal data
[09:40] <ElectricPrism> I learned the other day that Debian has a official forum - I was surprised though at how little activity it has compared to the ubuntu forums
[09:41] <ElectricPrism> Ubuntu Forum Posts: 11,795,654   Debian Forum Posts: 439,573
[09:41] <topper4125> with plugins like firesheep out there showing how easy exploits can be exposed.. you would think everyone fear personal info in the air and in the cloud. but then again M$ still has a lot to learn when it comes to computer security doesn't it? Lol
[09:42] <ElectricPrism> I'm in favor of the idea that bad security comes from bad programmers
[09:43] <ElectricPrism> I often hear arguments that php is insecure, but the reality is that php has a lot more code created by developers, and the quality of the code is less because the language is soo popular
[09:43] <Thundarr> watching Tron Uprising. This show is gorgeous.
[09:43] <ElectricPrism> a cartoon?
[09:43] <Thundarr> lot of known voice talent too
[09:43] <Thundarr> its cgi
[09:44] <Thundarr> its beautiful. the style is amazing. lot of love goes into it.
[09:44] <ElectricPrism> seeing tron in the metreon really was inspiring
[09:44] <ElectricPrism> the style looks cool
[09:45] <ElectricPrism> has anyone ever tried ripping dpkg out of a debian distro and grafting it onto say gentoo or arch?
[09:46] <topper4125> ElectricPrism, not me personally... I ran Arch for about 6 months and came back to ubuntu w/ Xfce DE
[09:47] <topper4125> I liked arch, but I spent too much time babysitting the OS... IMHO
[09:47] <Catbuntu> Arch is... :(
=== LT is now known as Guest88651
[09:47] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I have arch on my laptop and it's been an enlighening experience, but I admit I really miss Ubuntu Software Center and the vast number of packages on ubuntu, the #1 reason I value it
[09:47] <Catbuntu> I like XFCE.
[09:47] <Catbuntu> But it's too "conservative" for me, I preffer Unity, gnome-panel or Cinnamon.
[09:48] <Catbuntu> brb
[09:48] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: Yeah, that makes sense - It's really cool to be running SystemD, I find it easier to control services, but I don't need a highly secure system although I hate having software I dont know about since linux is soo vast in its software, and the names are cryptic and confusing
[09:48] <topper4125> Catbuntu XFCE is my fav DE... just the speed, and customization of it are perfect for me.
[09:49] <ElectricPrism> Catbuntu: I can't remember if it was XFCE or LXDE, one of those had a beautiful Alt+F2 run dialog, but I just can't get into unity
[09:49] <topper4125> ElectricPrism, ya that's my problem too...
[09:49] <ElectricPrism> ya
[09:49] <Malsasa_> topper4125: i like KDE :)
[09:49] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I thought about creating a linux accronym dictionary because stuff like /etc/fstab really should be named /config/filesystem-table
[09:50] <ElectricPrism> but I also respect that having the unix filesystem gives linux strength as a Unic operating system
[09:50] <Malsasa_> ElectricPrism: we can create a wallpaper from that dictionary
[09:50] <topper4125> I did find that installing Ubuntu-mini and building my system up from scratch about as good as and Arch install...
[09:50] <ElectricPrism> :)
[09:50] <TheFlipside> can someoney tell me what the countdown on the ubuntu website is for?
[09:50] <topper4125> ... if you're into minimal install idealls
[09:51] <topper4125> best guess TheFlipside, is Ubuntu for Android
[09:51] <TheFlipside> ah thanks
[09:51] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: Good point, I actually dislike that pacman file manager's options are again "cryptic" and "confusing"
[09:52] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: Imagine me trying to instruct me to give my wife instructions over the phone on the correct pacman command to update the system - "you're gonna have a bad time"
[09:52] <topper4125> I had a couple 'plug-ins' for pacman that kind of made it act like apt-get, it was a little easier, but not much
[09:52] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: how do I get the minimal install - I would love to use that, it sounds good
[09:53] <snx> where can I get ubuntu 13 iso
[09:53] <theadmin> ElectricPrism: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[09:53] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: yaoucht was pretty cool but then again the name was dumb, kindof like when you're a n00b and you're trying to remember how to spell nautilus
[09:53] <topper4125> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD 50 MBish download
[09:53] <ElectricPrism> ty
[09:53] <kylescottmcgill> :o they still compile that
[09:53] <kylescottmcgill> ....
[09:53] <ElectricPrism> 34mb XD, nice
[09:53] <kylescottmcgill> i thought they stopped after 9
[09:53] <topper4125> yup... its good for systems that don
[09:53] <topper4125> ... dont have PAE
[09:54] <kylescottmcgill> -_- i can feel myself rebuilding my desktop tonight
[09:54] <OerHeks> snx @ http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ plus support in #ubuntu+1
[09:54] <topper4125> nice thing about mini... wifi works out of the box... unlike arch...
[09:55] <kylescottmcgill> i love arch, but i suffer from that and more on a mac :(
[09:55] <ElectricPrism> I gotta admit that the one that I really wanted on ubuntu that I lacked was fbcondecor and plymouth, usplash looks like garbage on my 260gtx and I love having a background image on my TTY1, makes my OS look pro
[09:55] <shikata_ga_nai> happy new year err'body.
[09:56] <snx> happy new year
[09:56] <ElectricPrism> OMG I just got into Sublime Text 2, their new release is soo amazing, I loved Notepad++ but couldn't get into Geany or GEdit, soo glad to have it
[09:56] <ElectricPrism> Wait... did they switch from USplash to Plymouth?
[09:56] <topper4125> not sure
[09:56] <ElectricPrism> I see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Plymouth
[09:57] <dr_willis> Plymouth is the default on ubuntu for quite some time now
[09:57] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: Sublime is mint
[09:57] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: What does that mean, mint as in prime?
[09:57] <kylescottmcgill> mint as in its awesome
[09:57] <ElectricPrism> oic, cool! yeah they're the bomb and they're cross platform :)
[09:58] <kylescottmcgill> ya, its like the only software i feel proud to have brought, like it went to a good cause sorta thing
[09:58] <Catbuntu> back
[09:58] <kylescottmcgill> ... wasnt a waste of money is better said
[09:58] <ElectricPrism> dr_willis - maybe its my grub2 resolution then idk why bootup is so glitchy, I just can't wait till ubuntu switches to SystemD and possibly Wayland - although nowadays we're finally getting abilities that make X Server Screen hosting on another computer useful - It just took 30 years
[09:59] <dr_willis> you can set Grub2 to use a Text mode boot menu.
[09:59] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: you can change your grub2 boot settings to accomodate for your larger screen size
[09:59] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: Do you get any additional features from buying it? I know they're very liberal and dont limit a trial period
[10:00] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: none what so ever, trial version is supposed to be limited at some time in the near future i believe
[10:00] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: Yeah, I might need to, I'm not sure really, what I do know is my Samsung SyncMaster 710n dual 17" 1280x1024 aren't probably identified in Ubuntu so I need to set the resolution using xrandr :( QQ
[10:01] <kylescottmcgill> lol
[10:01] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: I need to finish a client project and purchase a license, software I'd be proud to own
[10:02] <ElectricPrism> I wiped out my 2tb volume using DD to all zeros, and now I've been copying 850,000 files and it's minuets away from completion, its been running since 48 hours ago - I'm soo stoked!
[10:02] <kylescottmcgill> lol sorry to hear your bad luck
[10:02] <ElectricPrism> A friend of mine told me that hard drives above 2TB have the data too condensed that it's starting to have problems reading and writing as clearly though, I wish I had the source
[10:03] <topper4125> I've only donated to 3 software houses :( Sent money to the Gimp, ZorinOS (cuz its pretty) and Canonical.
[10:03] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: My bad luck was caused by Windows chkdisk, It destroyed my NTFS $MFT because I used the drive often in Ubuntu, since then I got a 3TB EXT4 that I'm enjoying

[10:04] <ElectricPrism> having 10 years of files stuck in limbo is super lame though

[10:05] <morfeo_81> hi there
[10:05] <morfeo_81> Happy new year!!!
[10:05] <ElectricPrism> If I enabled the unstable repos would it be the same as running Ubuntu as a rolling release distro?
[10:06] <morfeo_81> How can createpermantly  ubuntu on usb external drive with my preference
[10:06] <kylescottmcgill> I havnt done that, but i think it wouldnt be like using Arch, i think unstable is more or less things are going to break, etc
[10:06] <kylescottmcgill> morfeo_81: do you mean an installation on a USB Drive?
[10:07] <ElectricPrism> you need a motherboard that can boot from usb, and a USB ideally 16GB+ I imagine it'd be simple, USB 3 is better, USB 2 is doable
[10:07] <topper4125> ElectricPrism, ya I think that gives puts your system on the bleeding edge of releases. (read into that a lot of breaking and babysitting of the OS)
[10:08] <morfeo_81> <kylescottmcgill>:no I mean to have ubuntu portable on different computer with my preference
[10:09] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I think I like the idea of rolling release better, Im tired of Sabayon and others having old software like Gnome 3.4 instead of 3.6, maybe I'll try to make it work with Unity,
[10:09] <Catbuntu> Which is the best DE Gnome2-like, Cinnamon or XFCE?
[10:09] <kylescottmcgill> oh right, i think you might have some issues with things like GFX Drivers and Wifi drivers etc, not to mention different CPU types, but i think you can, just install to a USB opposed to your HDD, and you will need to make sure you have a MBR on the USB
[10:09] <topper4125> ah... ya I'm the opposit with that... gimmie stability! :D
[10:10] <cfhowlett> !best|Catbuntu:
[10:10] <ubottu> Catbuntu:: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[10:10] <ElectricPrism> In unity I can't stand two things: The menu is on the left and I have no options to move it to the bottom, and 2) The close, max, min window controls when maximized are hidden in the global menu bar - has anyone solved either of these?
[10:10] <Catbuntu> Well, I know.
[10:10] <Catbuntu> I mean technicaly.
[10:10] <Catbuntu> GTK2/GTK3, etc.
[10:10] <auronandace> ElectricPrism: you don't solve them, they are like that by design
[10:10] <ElectricPrism> Catbuntu: Cinnamon almost won me over
[10:11] <kylescottmcgill> ElectricPrism: i believe there is app that gives you more control over the menu bar, but generally i use Gnome 3 (PPA is 3.6) or Awesome WM, which is a Tiling Window Manager
[10:11] <topper4125> the only way I solved it was to switch to XFCE... Unity destroys freedom to customize the desktop
[10:11] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: What is a Tiling Window Manager, I hear it mentioned a lot
[10:11] <ElectricPrism> amen
[10:12] <ElectricPrism> I would accept it, I even like the global menu and menu search, but those two things hurt my workflow
[10:12] <kylescottmcgill> The windows dont float naturally, evetyhing is more or less bound to the keyboard, so when im swapping apps i rarely use the mouse
[10:13] <morfeo_81> Best way to get portable Ubuntu on USB Drive?
[10:13] <ElectricPrism> in windows I had the panel on the bottom and a dock on each side of my screen to quickly launch work folders, etc... and I have 4:3 monitors so the whole design for "widescreen" doesn't benefit me :(
[10:13] <kylescottmcgill> Check out Google Images, you will be sure to find some examples, just get ready for a lot of work, normally there is a GUI to configure a Tiling Window manager, normally its in a scripting language
[10:13] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: are the windows always fullscreen? because I find TTY1-7 just like having open tabs in Firefox and totally useful
[10:13] <ElectricPrism> ah

=== Benny is now known as Guest43293
[10:14] <topper4125> If you think 4:3 is harsh with Unity... try a netbook form factor 1024X600... there's a lot of lost desktop usage with only 600 vertical pixles...
[10:15] <ElectricPrism> owch
[10:15] <ElectricPrism> firefox on that would be painful with its menu bars
[10:15] <kylescottmcgill> lol topper4125 you sir, need a Xmonad, or Awesome :D
[10:15] <ElectricPrism> The more I delve into linux, the more that I find myself a minority in the world, soo sad...
[10:15] <deniska> Hello. 3.2.0-35-generic-pae kernel, Samsung NP350 series laptop, after suspend to ram fn key is sticky
[10:16] <topper4125> I've been hearing a lot about xmonad lately.. might have to look into it
[10:16] <deniska> Like f2 acts like fn+f2 (brightness down)
[10:16] <kylescottmcgill> Its in Haskell, so good luck :)
[10:16] <ElectricPrism> yeah, I only know about it from lunduke.com personally, but hm
[10:17] <topper4125> Lunduke... I wish he'd return to Linux Action Show...
[10:17] <ElectricPrism> When I look up xmonad I see this picture and I run like hell: http://www.haskell.org/wikiupload/a/aa/Screen-triplehead-galois.jpg
[10:17] <ElectricPrism> He was really a down to earth dude, and I felt like he thought how I thought
[10:17] <kylescottmcgill> deniska: you could hack it to reset/unset the FN keys Stickey, inside .profile or an autostart file, other than that i dont know if there is a setting for it
[10:17] <topper4125> me too
[10:18] <ElectricPrism> maybe I'll return to gentoo
[10:18] <ElectricPrism> I mean ubuntu, from gentoo
[10:18] <kylescottmcgill> Xmonad is really nice, really fast, but a lot of tweaking until you get it setup the way you like
[10:19] <topper4125> If you really want a challenge... could give linux from scratch a try... I can't make it past Chapter one with out drooling and falling asleep... but that's just me
[10:19] <ElectricPrism> kylescottmcgill: Why is it that performance is such a problem in the nix* world, does everyone just have mid to low range hardware idk
[10:20] <ElectricPrism> topper4125: I would love to, but honestly there starts to be too many distros to keep up on in the X world

[10:40] <serp_> in other news, WinZip is in version 17
[10:40] <OerHeks> dr_willis, 270 kb v1,82 in 1997
[10:40] <topper4125> I'm sure half that download is the license agreement
[10:41] <dencrypt> people still use winzip?
[10:41] <serp_> and toolbars
[10:42] <topper4125> I figured that after EVERY OS built Zip support into themselves WinZip would ahve died.
[10:45] <theadmin> topper4125: Yeah, kinda weird that paid archivers like WinZIP and WinRAR still exist

[11:14] <Emanon> Wow this actually works pretty well in Thunderbird.
[11:14] <bs123> what?
[11:14] <Emanon> Aparrently Thunderbird has built in chat+irc now.
[11:15] <Emanon> And it's actually usable.
[11:15] <bs123> huh didn't know that

[11:17] <Emanon> Darn it doesn't have tab completion.
[11:18] <Cong> What methods are there to remove items from the gnome-panel on Ubuntu 12.04?
[11:19] <Emanon> Guess I'm still using Pidgin. I love me some tab completion.
[11:19] <tenX> Emanon: props to pidgin
[11:20] <Emanon> Yea, I only wish it existed on Android.
[11:20] <Cong> Yuck! Pidgin.
[11:20] <Emanon> Kind of a pain to get SASL patched for Pidgin though.
[11:20] <tenX> Cong: why?
[11:21] <tenX> Emanon: sasl?
[11:21] <bs123tbird> ha
[11:22] <Cong> tenX, it just is.
[11:22] <Emanon> A type of authentication. Freenode requires it for any connection coming through their onion.
[11:22] <bs123tbird> emanon thanx for the tip....windows version has a client too in tbird
[11:22] <tenX> Emanon: familiar with sasl basically, just wondering about irc usage thx
[11:23] <Emanon> Yea, you have to be sasl compatible to use freenode through tor.
[11:23] <tenX> Cong: for whatever reason
[11:23] <Cong> How am I suppose to remove files placed in the gnome-panel?
[11:23] <tenX> Emanon: k i c dont have anything to hide so far
[11:23] <Cong> tenX, for many reasons.
[11:24] <Emanon> I'd like to know how to remove entries in my apps panel too. I have a shortcut to a wine program that no longer exists that I would like to remove.
[11:24] <tenX> Cong: name at least one
[11:24] <Emanon> tenX: Tor isn't about having things to hide it's about having privacy there's a pretty big difference.
[11:26] <tenX> Emanon: who cares about some chat lines
[11:26] <Emanon> I don't have a whole lot to "hide" but I still shut the bathroom door when I'm in there. Some things you just prefer to keep between the people you choose.
[11:27] <tenX> Emanon: thats partially overrated
[11:28] <llutz> tenX: privacy can't be overrated
[11:29] <Emanon> If you leave data laying about everywhere it's far too easy for someone malicious to make an unflattering narrative of your actions. And while such a story might not be true it could very well be made up of facts, specifically the ones you left littered around.
[11:29] <tenX> llutz: principally not
[11:30] <Emanon> You're entitled to your position on the matter but I prefer not to be a data litterbug.
[11:30] <Cong> Emanon, press alt + win, right click, and left click remove.
[11:30] <tenX> Emanon: define the actual threat
[11:31] <Cong> If you're not buying something you're the thing being sold.

[11:32] <angs> what is the equivalent directory of cat /proc/bus/usb/devices on ubuntu?

[11:37] <tenX> Emanon: dont get me wrong. pretty familiar with the net

[11:40] <Emanon> Individual points of data may be harmless by themselves but when you get enough points of data you can do one of two things. You can get an accurate picture of something (whether or not it's you're business) and you can twist it to paint an inaccurate picture. Now most of the time you don't have to worry about this but in the event that you DO it's so devastating that you pretty much have to plan for the worst even if it's unlikely b

[12:17] <blackline2> I managed to lock myself out of my user account when trying to disable and uninstall eCryptFS following this guide: http://virtually-a-machine.blogspot.se/2010/08/howto-disable-ecryptfs.html
[12:17] <blackline2> Anyone up for trying to help me out?
[12:18] <blackline2> As for the guide I did the exact same steps except from while moving the files with "mv Private/* ." which I did as sudo (maybe cause of error, don't know)
[12:19] <Azmuth> any good ubuntu downloader that is like idm and free ?
[12:19] <blackline2> Now when I try to log in to the desktop I get the message: "Could not update ICEauthority file /home/user/.ICEauthority".
[12:19] <mangdood_> I'm trying to make a judgment whether I should upgrade to KUbuntu 12.10 or Ubuntu 12.10. I'm still using 12.04 (I think). How can I tell how well maintained Kubuntu is?
[12:19] <mangdood_> blackline2: I think it's because now your home folder is owned by root
[12:19] <kylescottmcgill> blackline2: try sudo chmod 777 .ICE.....
[12:20] <kylescottmcgill> or the above
[12:20] <Azmuth> mangdood_: ubuntu 12.04 is like is 12.10
[12:20] <blackline2> mangdood_, that was my guess to. how do I in a correct way make sure that it is owned by me?
[12:20] <kylescottmcgill> you could also chown the directory back to who you are
[12:20] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, actually i checked the permissions at that file and it was owned by me.
[12:20] <mangdood_> blackline2: sudo chown -R <homefolder>
[12:20] <kylescottmcgill> sudo chown -R <your-user>.<your-user> /home/<your-user>
[12:20] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, How do I chown the whole directory + content?
[12:21] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, thanks
[12:21] <kylescottmcgill> mangdood_: does chown use whoami as the default?
[12:21] <mangdood_> kylescottmcgill: I wouldn't know :p
[12:22] <kylescottmcgill> lol ok stick with mine, you should be sorted after that blackline2
[12:22] <Azmuth> i have downloaded java tar.gz package and extracted it,now how to install it ?
[12:22] <mangdood_> I just know that you don't need to include the syntax explicitly (as long as you're not using su or logged in with another user)
[12:23] <kylescottmcgill> i see
[12:23] <kylescottmcgill> Azmuth: whats in the Tar file?
[12:23] <Azmuth> its a tar file for java installtion
[12:24] <Azmuth> inside it there is a folder named "jre1.7.0_10"
[12:24] <kylescottmcgill> Azmuth: wouldnt you just sudo apt-get javasdk ? (or something) opposed to installing a tar ball
[12:24] <Azmuth> kylescottmcgill: now i have downloaded the tar
[12:24] <Azmuth> is there any way i can install from it ?
[12:25] <mangdood_> Azmuth: You probably don't want the tar unless you know what you're doing
[12:25] <mangdood_> Azmuth: It's less work to install it with apt-get and easier to maintain
[12:25] <kylescottmcgill> Azmuth: sudo apt-cache search jre
[12:25] <kylescottmcgill> pick one of those
[12:25] <Azmuth> ok
[12:25] <kylescottmcgill> then sudo apt-get install <the-one-you-need>
[12:26] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, At least I got further into the desktop, but now I got the message that it could not write to the file. I think I tried deleting it according to a "solution" I read before entering here... Except for the ownership, is there any difference in this file you think? Could I copy it from another user account to my folder and just change ownership?
[12:26] <kylescottmcgill> whats the file
[12:26] <kylescottmcgill> and maybe
[12:27] <kylescottmcgill> normally, if it cant find it, it will create it
[12:27] <blackline2> .ICEauthority
[12:27] <kylescottmcgill> if the file is there, you may need to change the permissions on the file
[12:27] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill,  it isnt
[12:27] <kylescottmcgill> -rw-------  1 kyle kyle  3418 Dec 31 15:25 .ICEauthority
[12:27] <kylescottmcgill> thats what mine looks like
[12:28] <blackline2> i had it before but tried erasing it in hope of it getting created again.
[12:28] <kylescottmcgill> *try* to touch .ICEauthority
[12:28] <kylescottmcgill> touch a command, it will create the file
[12:29] <kylescottmcgill> so
[12:29] <kylescottmcgill> touch .ICEauthority ; chmod 600 .ICEauthority
[12:31] <joey8> .
[12:32] <kylescottmcgill> blackline2: are you installing Gnome 3?
[12:34] <Azmuth> Installed jave from tar.gz,,,Thanks to http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/install-oracle-java-runtime-jre-7-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/
[12:34] <kylescottmcgill> Azmuth: awesome :)
[12:36] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, I use Unity (i suppose :/ )
[12:36] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, Now I see that .ICEauthority is owned by me.
[12:36] <kylescottmcgill> blackline2: ok when i googled it, alot of people where swapping Window or Desktop managers when the issue occured
[12:36] <kylescottmcgill> does it work?
[12:36] <kylescottmcgill> logging in i mean
[12:37] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, the message i get trying to log in is that it cannot update the file. the file has been recreated after i touched it, had to touch it as sudo to be able to touch it. then changed owner with chown
=== qos|away is now known as qos
[12:37] <blackline2> So no, it doesnt work
[12:37] <Azmuth> kylescottmcgill: when i run gta sa under wine it don't start in full screen.Do you know how to fix it ?
[12:38] <kylescottmcgill> if you had to sudo to touch it, this means your /home/<user> folder is owned by root, and you should change that, as for Wine and Fullscreen, that will be unrelated i would imagine, and i wouldnt have a clue, #wine-hq might have a better idea sorry
[12:39] <Azmuth> ok nvm
[12:39] <Azmuth> thanks for support
[12:39] <Azmuth> you are very helpful
[12:40] <kylescottmcgill> Azmuth: sorry i thought you were the other guy... stupid weechat highlighting, as for your issue, the second part applies to you :)
[12:41] <blackline2> kylescottmcgill, that was my guess from the beginning. did "sudo chown -R marcus.marcus /home/marcus" now but still same issue.
[12:41] <blackline2> "Can't update ICE..."
[12:42] <kylescottmcgill> sudo chown -R marcus.marcus /home/marcus ; sudo chmod 755 /home/marcus ; should set up your home dir properly
[12:43] <kylescottmcgill> as for your ice issue, the above file permissions should fix it, if it doesnt the only thing that teh internet suggests is to reinstall gnome-session, but i think thats a little extreme

[13:17] <alazare619> looking for some help with fstab i have a odd issue basically i have a drive lets call it "Storage" I want it to be mounted to where any user (INCLUDING DAEMONS/SERVICES) can read write and execute any file on that drive regardless of who created the file ill paste my current fstab to pastebin
[13:17] <alazare619> http://pastebin.com/gDGhGuqD
[13:18] <alazare619> the one with the uuid is the drive mounted currently to /media/storage wich is where id like to be able to keep it if possible
[13:18] <Cong> I have a partition called Storage too!
[13:19] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, Yes everything works like a charm!
[13:20] <kylescottmcgill> nice
[13:20] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, If your up for it I would really appreciate if you could help me out to move my home directory to another storage (already mounted). It's pretty much the same as I did now but before I messed up and since I have a clean start now I would like to do it the right way :)
[13:21] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, For now my home directory is stored on the ssd that the system runs from. I would like it to be stored at /sdb1 which is mounted as /media/Storage
[13:21] <kylescottmcgill> blackline: is it external to your computer?
[13:22] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, it's internal
[13:22] <kylescottmcgill> ok
[13:22] <blackline> but i've intentionally mounted it under media just since i wanted it listed as a drive in nautilus
[13:22] <blackline> i would be ok with changing the mountpoint if /media/ isn't the proper way to go
[13:22] <kylescottmcgill> there is a couple of ways you could do this
[13:23] <blackline> having it in /media "feels" kind of external
[13:23] <blackline> Any ideas on that. Would it look more proper to mount it elsewhere before I go on moving stuff?
[13:23] <kylescottmcgill> 1) would be to setup a new user, then use the /media/x/x/homedir/ as the home dir, or 2) you could mv everything on to the hdd then modify your fstab records
[13:24] <kylescottmcgill> quick question, what format is your /media/ drive?
[13:24] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, as for now it's mounted in fstab, i've put it there
[13:24] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, it's ext4
[13:24] <kylescottmcgill> it would need to be ext4 for it work properly
[13:24] <kylescottmcgill> ok awesome, you shouldnt have any problems with Permissions etc then
[13:25] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, no. this should work. i just want it to be placed fany when it comes to mountpoint :)
[13:25] <kylescottmcgill> if you move everything on to the drive, then change you fstab to point /home to the new location you should be sweet
[13:25] <blackline> ...and of course working :)
[13:25] <blackline> sounds great.
[13:26] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: whats the storage type? FAT32/EXT4/X
[13:26] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, so how do i perform the whole moving?
[13:27] <alazare619> ext4
[13:27] <alazare619> as you can see in the fstab currently
[13:27] <alazare619> its the line with the UUID refrence as its the only NON virtual partition
[13:28] <kylescottmcgill> blackline: you might want to logout, and change to another tab CTL + ALT + F1 and login as root
[13:28] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, and then?
[13:28] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, should i make a new user first to be able to enter in desktop if i get locked out? :)
[13:29] <kylescottmcgill> then cp -prvf /home/marcus /media/path/to/other/hdd/
[13:29] <kylescottmcgill> i would cp first, incase it dies part way through or something wierd
[13:29] <kylescottmcgill> thats why you would cp first
[13:30] <kylescottmcgill> then once we have change the fstab, you can always revert the fstab and go back to normal
[13:30] <LKiS> please anyone can tell me what alternative software for open yahoo messenger url like this -> ymsgr:sendIM?noobs
[13:30] <kylescottmcgill> after the /home has completed, i would advise to mv /home /home-old for a backup
[13:30] <alazare619> kyles basically what im going to do is have a bare drive, that no matter what file is created under wich user it will always be a 777 folder and a 666 file
[13:31] <alazare619> so that any user can read write any file
[13:31] <alazare619> under any folder
[13:32] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: so you need fstab umask options
[13:32] <blackline> kylescottmcgill, i'll give this a try. see you in a while. *hopefully
[13:32] <alazare619> yea wich im not exactly familiar with
[13:33] <alazare619> well technically
[13:33] <alazare619> i just want it all 777
[13:33] <alazare619> jsut to make it easy
[13:34] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: just finding a proper and quick way to do it, there is a couple
[13:35] <kylescottmcgill> fstab umask, or ACL
[13:35] <kylescottmcgill> you kinda want the same as a samba share, anyone can read/write/execute from it etc
[13:38] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: im pretty sure you want umask=000 in your fstab
[13:39] <alazare619> UUID=426c4e71-524e-48a1-bffb-a323c1e845bb       /media/storage/ ext4  umask=000        1 2
[13:39] <alazare619> just like that?
[13:39] <Eagleman> I want my proxypass only at 1 of my FQDN's, now its on both of my FQDN's, Any idea what i did wrong?  http://pastebin.com/JMSvpcKT
[13:40] <KRomeleon> can anyone help with a question, who is in charge of the icons for the web apps?
[13:40] <KRomeleon> google plus updated their logo long ago and firefox still installs the old logo of an icobn
[13:40] <kylescottmcgill> alazare619: yup
[13:41] <KRomeleon> who is in charge of the icons? canonical?
[13:41] <alazare619> so just swap otu defaults to umask=000
[13:41] <kylescottmcgill> KRomeleon: depends on who maintains the package
[13:42] <kylescottmcgill> yeah i wouldnt advise doing this on, lets say your home directory, because applications use files in your home directory and 777 will sometimes through errors, but for other storage drives ya
[13:43] <bhavesh> Will Linux Mint be any different than my Ubuntu with Cinnamon installed excluding minor changes?
[13:43] <Eagleman> I want my proxypass only at 1 of my FQDN's, now its on both of my FQDN's, Any idea what i did wrong?  http://pastebin.com/JMSvpcKT
[13:43] <KRomeleon> bhavesh, yes
[13:43] <KRomeleon> lesser software center for one
[13:45] <kylescottmcgill> sorry Eagleman im not clued up on proxy's you might have to wait for someone else to answer your question
[13:46] <Eagleman> I think i figured it out
[13:46] <alazare619> guess i would actually want umask, dmask and fmask as 000

[13:57] <krz> right, but you know a site that sells replacement keys?
[13:58] <cfhowlett> krz: ask the OEM.
[13:58] <OerHeks> krz, with a laptop you need to replace the whole keyboard, unless you find a broken laptop where you can pull that key out

[14:17] <alienaut> where can i find binary files of my applications
[14:20] <Name141> is there a way to run the equivalent of 'ipconfig /release' and 'ipconfig /renew' in linux?
[14:20] <JPMH> alienaut: where did you compile them to?  generally whereis file will yell you where it will execute from though
[14:20] <Emanon> alienaut: /bin  maybe?
[14:21] <MonkeyDust> alienaut  try /usr/bin/ and /usr/sbin/
[14:21] <Emanon> Sorry, that's what I mean.
[14:22] <OerHeks> alienaut, good explanation where and howto find it > http://askubuntu.com/questions/60826/where-is-the-default-folder-for-apps
[14:22] <Emanon> I guess /bin is for base system binaries huh? /usr is for userland apps.
[14:22] <JPMH> whereis will tell you where it comes from when you launch iyt at the shell
[14:22] <OerHeks> or find or locate
[14:23] <BluesKaj> Name141, it's better if you explain what you're trying to do.
[14:23] <JPMH> Emanon: no - reaaly depends where it originated - thats why we have /bin /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin etc
[14:23] <Emanon> Really? I thought it had to do with what they related to.
[14:24] <JPMH> Emanon: should be but it seems that is more an element of which of the unix paths it originated with
[14:24] <Emanon> Like /bin would be the base bins without which the system would not operate whereas /usr/bin was userland apps I didn't even think of /usr/local/bin
[14:25] <JPMH> Emanon: I agree it would be nice  = then you would even be able to forecast where they were
[14:25] <Emanon> I'm a little distracted trying to get backtrack running on my phone too.
[14:26] <Emanon> It's no excuse though ;-)
[14:26] <JPMH> and what even makes it worse is that there are some commands that are USUALLY bins that are simulated by some of the shells and not others
[14:26] <Emanon> Sounds like kind of a cluster----.
[14:28] <JPMH> I agree Emanon  but once something was released on one of the Unixes (back when they were dominant) it went into which one was there and then when it migrated it stayed there,  at least this is as I understand it

[14:29] <MonkeyDust> JPMH  free and open source software
[14:30] <JPMH> MonkeyDust: ty
[14:30] <JPMH> Isn't Adnroid free and open?
[14:31] <J_Cray> Speaking of FOSS, what would be the difference with FLOSS? More of an emphasis on free as in beer?
[14:31] <Emanon> Yes and no, just like desktop distros it's complicated.

[15:50] <srhb> repozitor: The destination computer is on your local net?
[15:50] <repozitor> no
[15:50] <srhb> repozitor: Well, you need the remote IP.
[15:50] <repozitor> i know if it exist on my local network, then i can use SSH
[15:51] <repozitor> i should get remote IP from ISP?
[15:51] <srhb> repozitor: Easier to get it from the person with the destination computer
[15:51] <repozitor> destination computer is for me
[15:51] <Night-hacks> i get  ssh permission denied please try again. while trying to ssh to my server, and it was ok yesterday !!
[15:52] <repozitor> and i know that IP
[15:52] <srhb> repozitor: Then I don't understand your problem. ssh user@destination_ip
[15:52] <repozitor> my destination computer connected using ADSL2+
[15:52] <Night-hacks> any idea ?
[15:53] <repozitor> for example my ip is 2.177.168.155
[15:53] <repozitor> but you can't connect using SSH to me
[15:53] <repozitor> do you got it?
[15:53] <srhb> repozitor: Does port 22 get forwarded to your computer?
[15:54] <repozitor> i don't know what is this
[15:54] <repozitor> what is this?
[15:54] <srhb> repozitor: The port that the SSH server responds on. Your router should forward requests to that port to your computer with the SSH server.
[15:54] <repozitor> and my desktop destination computer ip is :5.199.140.67
[15:55] <repozitor> both my LP and my desktop computer connected to net, using ADSL2+ from ISP
[15:55] <rick2> BluesKaj, I probably did upgrades meanwhile, sure ... but now, youtube videos no longer show up in the volume indicator ... does it work for you?
[15:56] <repozitor> and my ip shared between 8 another user, this is not dedicated
[15:56] <srhb> repozitor: The information you need is how to forward port 22 to your local ssh server.
[15:56] <kqr> i have encountered a strange problem with my ubuntu. after I rebooted last, all xft fonts have gone huge. what previously looked like 12 pt now looks like 18 pt. this applies both to my terminal, my status bar and my web browser. it does not happen with my email client or music player. does anyone have any idea what could have happened?
[15:56] <srhb> repozitor: That depends on your router/the equipment you got from your ISP.
[15:57] <repozitor> srhb, is there exist any external server for this goal?
[15:57] <repozitor> for example how teamviewer works fine?
[15:57] <srhb> repozitor: Team viewer uses a middle man, afaik.
[15:57] <repozitor> team viewer don't need to have any special device
[15:57] <srhb> repozitor: But yes, you can set up reverse tunnels on an external server if you have access to one.
[15:57] <repozitor> yes, i mean is there exist any MITM to establish this connection?
[15:58] <srhb> repozitor: Sure, any VPN service could do.
[15:58] <repozitor> VPN on desktop computer?
[15:58] <repozitor> VPN service*
[15:58] <srhb> repozitor: Any Linux computer that you can reach on port 22 and have access to would do fine
[15:59] <repozitor> for VPN we need to have domain, yes?
[15:59] <srhb> repozitor: Nope. As I said, any port 22 reachable address will suffice.
[16:00] <BluesKaj> rick2, so you have video , but no audio on youtube ?
=== ydnar_ is now known as ydnar
[16:00] <repozitor> hhhmm, i can't understand your mean
[16:00] <repozitor> can you help me to do your suggest?
[16:00] <repozitor> or get me usefull link
[16:00] <srhb> repozitor: I think your questions are not really very Ubuntu-related and much more about basic networkiing. Perhaps you could search for basic information on accessing port 22 remotely on Google. :) I'm sure there are dedicated channels to help if you get stuck
[16:01] <rick2> BluesKaj, I am talking about the youtube webapp ! i no longer shows the media controls in the volume indicator when I'm watching a video
[16:01] <mohawk> hello, I am currently running ubuntu 12.04'. it has been having trouble connecting to the internet. my house network is a wpa 2 network. when I try to connect it just repeatedly asks for my Passcode, but when I join an unlocked network it shows up as I have internet, but then when I try to open a webpage or something it says I am not connected
[16:01] <KM0201> what is ubuntu's homepage referring to?
[16:02] <rick2> BluesKaj, webapp is the new feature introduced in 12.10 where websites can integrate in unity ... Both the youtube and the facebook are not fully working for me
[16:03] <repozitor> srhb, tnx for helping
[16:03] <repozitor> my last request is can you tell me what i search on google?
[16:03] <rick2> BluesKaj, maybe those sites changed API, and no update was released for the webapps ... I imagine, but dunno
[16:03] <repozitor> i don't have any start point
[16:03] <mohawk> so basically I can connect, but not to sp
[16:03] <mohawk> so
[16:04] <mohawk> locked network
[16:04] <cfhowlett> KM0201: countdown? unknown.  rumor says ubuntu on android/tv/phone
[16:04] <BluesKaj> rick2, try reinstalling flash , but it could be your browser too , not sure
[16:04] <srhb> repozitor: Try "forward ports from router"
[16:04] <srhb> repozitor: Then combine with ssh server afterwards
[16:04] <KM0201> cfhowlett: i kinda thought phone.. but wasn't 100% sure.. i thought maybe this was a known project, but just doing some googling, looks like nobody knows, just speculation
[16:04] <rick2> BluesKaj, dude, dude! I am talking about ubuntu-webapp integration, not flash !!
[16:05] <cfhowlett> KM0201: yep
[16:05] <rick2> flash works fine. just not the unity integration
[16:05] <pip__> Hi, what is the Ubuntu website counting down to at the moment?
[16:05] <mohawk>  I had ubuntu 12.10 before and it gave me the same probLen, so it cannot be my computer
[16:05] <rick2> BluesKaj, the facebook webapp from ubuntu 12.10 is was broken, since the new facebook messaging system
[16:05] <rick2> s/was/also
[16:06] <mohawk>  sorry for my bad spelling but I am on a Kindle fire keyboard
[16:06] <BluesKaj> rick2, ok , sorry , i don't use unity :P
[16:06] <BS-Harou> hello, is there any way to disable the Ubuntu 12.04 unity dash fade-in animation on opening?
[16:07] <mohawk>  so, does ubuntu have issues connecting to locked networks or something Kline? it worked yesterday, then it just never connected again
[16:08] <srhb> I too am curious about that countdown. No imminent releases are planned, are they?
[16:08] <cfhowlett> srhb: none
[16:08] <srhb> Weird.
[16:08] <ThinkT510> srhb: next scheduled release is 13.04 in april
[16:08] <srhb> Yeah. Maybe the countdown is a new years bug :P
[16:08] <mohawk>  I too am curious about how to fix my computer. :)
[16:09] <ThinkT510> mohawk: sounds like an access point issue
[16:09] <mohawk> what do you mean?
[16:10] <ThinkT510> mohawk: tried restarting the router you're trying to connect to?
[16:10] <mohawk>  everyone else on my network can connect but my ubuntu
[16:10] <k1l> mohawk: is the pw corect? does it contain special characters? which wifi card do you use?
[16:10] <stef1a> my sound doesn't work in ubuntu 12.10 and i've tried using the ubuntu troubleshooting guide
[16:11] <mohawk> I have tried restarting the router, it worked just yesterday and then it stopped
[16:11] <krywk> I need help with QJackCTL
[16:11] <krywk> Well, more like help, I need tips for Jack.
[16:11] <SpiceMan> (ubuntu 11.10) the mysql upgrade bug bit me before I googled it and I broke it further :p. dpkg wants to configure mysql-server-5.1 and I don't care. how can I make it get rid of everything mysql- so I can just apt-get afresh?
[16:12] <krywk> How can I reduce latency without loosing audio quality?
[16:12] <krywk> losing*
[16:12] <SpiceMan> (wants me and fails at it)
[16:12] <mohawk>  I do not use any special Wi-Fi cardso whatever was in my pc in the beginning....
[16:12] <cfhowlett> krywk: are you using the low latency kernel
[16:13] <krywk> When I installed JACK, it asked to use realtime kernel. If by low latency kernel you mean that, then yes.
[16:13] <mohawk> just a normal card that worked yesterday, just a normal network and pc that worked yesterday...
[16:13] <cfhowlett> krywk: right.
[16:14] <krywk> Right now I'm getting...
[16:14] <krywk> 46.4 msec
[16:14] <krywk> which is annoying at some point :/
[16:15] <pip__> maybe it's a point release for 12.04?
[16:15] <srhb> Despite having set vm writeback timeout to 10 minutes, I keep seeing kB written in iostat every few seconds. What's going on?
[16:17] <ThinkT510> pip__: no, the point releases are every 6 months
[16:17] <krywk> So uh, what can I do to reduce latency? :/
[16:18] <k1l> mohawk: im not aware of any general changes on ubuntu that should have made your wiki not work today.
[16:18] <kslater> Ok, so I need to move off of 10.10 to something else. The question is what? I'd like to move to 12.04.1 LTS 64 bit, but I'm not sure I can get there without a clean install. I don't care about the time required so much, although it's a factor (I'll just have to use a different machine to do development work for a while).
[16:18] <noob6534> hey
[16:18] <noob6534> anybody
[16:19] <jrib> !upgrade | kslater
[16:19] <ubottu> kslater: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[16:19] <ThinkT510> kslater: whats stopping  you from clean installing 12.04
[16:19] <mohawk> I cannot wait until the ubuntu 13,04 comes out. I wonder if there will be a new ui or something
[16:19] <k1l> kslater: 10.10 is EOL some time
[16:19] <cfhowlett> kslater: clean install is recommended.  and you can't upgrade from 10.10 to 12.04
[16:19] <kslater> Too much stuff installed for a clean install
[16:19] <cfhowlett> noob6534: yes we see you
=== rslacke is now known as |Slacker|
[16:20] <mohawk>  I know people that still use ubuntu 9,04
[16:20] <kslater> how about a stepped process? say to 11.04 LTS and then up to 12.04 LTS?
[16:20] <jrib> kslater: yes, see ubottu.
[16:20] <ThinkT510> kslater: 11.04 was not lts
=== |Slacker| is now known as Guest30155
[16:20] <kslater> oh, there isn't a 11.04 LTS
[16:20] <kslater> right
[16:20] <cfhowlett> mohawk: I know people that still use XP.  Doesn't make it a smart thing to do.
[16:20] <noob6534> can anybody recommec some online game on ubuntu?
[16:20] <noob6534> recommend*
[16:20] <ThinkT510> kslater: 11.04 is also no longer supported
[16:20] <kslater> so how about to 11.10 and then up to 12.04?
[16:21] <jrib> kslater: this is all detailed in the link ubottu gave you
[16:21] <mohawk> 75% of Windows users use xp almost
[16:21] <cfhowlett> kslater: from 10.04 you can upgrade directly to 12.04.  otherwise, 10.10 to 11.04, 11.10, 12.04
[16:21] <kslater> yeah, reading now. Let me see what I can do.
[16:21] <k1l> kslater: if you want upgrade you need every step untill 12.04, which is upgrade to 11.04, 11.10 and then 12.04
[16:21] <kslater> cfhowlett: thanks.
[16:21] <jrib> !eol | k1l
[16:21] <ubottu> k1l: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[16:21] <jrib> erm
[16:21] <jrib> kslater: that too ^
[16:21] <noob6534> leave
[16:21] <ThinkT510> kslater: you'd need to go 10.10 > 11.04 > 11.10 > 12.04 (and considering 11.04 is end of life that makes it difficult)
[16:22] <cfhowlett> kslater: good luck.
[16:22]  * kslater figures to be reading a lot on New Years day
[16:22] <topper4125> you can upgrade from what ever version you have now, to the LTS that came out after that... then upgrade from LTS to LTS all the way to current
[16:22] <kslater> cfhowlett: thanks
[16:23] <kslater> I have one more backup to run before I get started, so I'd better get cracking
[16:24] <topper4125> kslater, is your home directory on a seperate partition?
[16:24] <krywk> cfhowlett, any tips on how to reduce latency? ;/
[16:24] <cfhowlett> topper4125: check your sources.  Unless I'm mistaken, you can not upgrade from in interim to an LTS release unless the LTS is the next release in sequence, e.g. 11.10 to 12.04.
[16:24] <kslater> topper4125: no, it's on the same partition as /
[16:24] <kslater> unfortunately.
[16:25] <kslater> will the upgrade process look at free disk space to make sure it has enough before proceeding?
[16:25] <cfhowlett> krywk: sorry, I don't use jack and never learned how.  FWIW I'm on Ubuntustudio.  I bet the #ubuntustudio channel would have some ideas for your, though.
[16:25] <cfhowlett> kslater: yes.
[16:25] <kslater> cool
[16:26] <ThinkT510> kslater: seriously, you are better off fresh installing
[16:26] <krywk> I always wondered what 'FWIW' meant
[16:26] <krywk> :|
[16:26] <kslater> ThinkT510: if only
[16:26] <ThinkT510> krywk: for what its worth
[16:26] <cfhowlett> For what it's worth
[16:26] <krywk> Oh, ok, thanks c:
[16:26] <krywk> Thanks for the help anyways :D
[16:26] <k1l> kslater: i would recommend a fresh install if possible.
[16:27] <ThinkT510> kslater: especially so if you've installed ppas
[16:27] <cfhowlett> kslater: gotta agree with k1l.  clean install avoids a whole lot of headaches.
[16:27] <usr13> !lts | kslater
[16:27] <ubottu> kslater: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[16:27] <pip__> uh, that's going to annoy me until I find out what it is
[16:27] <kslater> the problem is that this machine is my day-to-day laptop. And the software that's installed on it was built up over time. My fear is that I'll get to an upgraded OS without some required package and won't be able to get a suitable replacement
[16:27] <pip__> I can wait a day I guess :)
[16:28] <kslater> I'll be on an LTS release if possible
[16:28] <topper4125> kslater, you're running 10.10 right?
[16:28] <kslater> right
[16:28] <kslater> 10.10 64 bit
[16:28] <usr13> kslater: YOu should have thought of that before you let ELO come-and-go.
[16:28] <usr13> *EOL
[16:28] <kslater> indeed
[16:28] <topper4125> you can upgrade to 11.04, LTS... then go from there: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NattyUpgrades
[16:28] <ThinkT510> usr13 +1
[16:29] <kslater> ELO, I'm going to put them on Spotify now
[16:29] <ThinkT510> topper4125: 11.04 is not lts, its eol
[16:29] <cfhowlett> kslater: it's not like 10.10 is going to suddenly stop working.  Prepare for your upgrade, back up what you need to back up, maybe beg/borrow/steal a secondary computer so you can continue working and bite the upgrade bullet.
[16:29] <lakshya> sir please  talk to you i am clean /boot & /tmp files
[16:30] <kslater> cfhowlett: agreed on the stopping working, it's just getting annoying working around the update notifications. And I'm going to need to move to 12.04.1 soon enough anyway for other (development platform) reasons.
[16:31] <cfhowlett> kslater: which is exactly why I decided to only install and maintain LTS releases.
[16:31] <malefiku> Hello
[16:31] <cfhowlett> malefiku: greetings
[16:31] <topper4125> You can then upgrade 11.04 to 11.10 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OneiricUpgrades#Upgrade_from_11.04_to_11.10 and 11.10 is *NOT* Eol... then up to 12.04 LTS
[16:31] <kslater> yeah, it makes good sense
[16:31] <malefiku> Happy New Year to all of you
[16:32] <hexbyte> Happy New Year...
[16:32] <usr13> kslater: If you were on 10.04 right now, it would be an easy task, and you would have several months before you have to actually do it.
[16:32] <topper4125> OH OH OH Now I see where I'm reading that wrong... drrr
[16:32] <malefiku> Who is a master in domains and DNS settings
[16:32] <malefiku> ????
[16:32] <demensdeum> hello
[16:32] <kslater> thanks for the help everyone.
[16:33] <malefiku> Who is master in DNS, please contact me in private
[16:33] <cfhowlett> kslater: take your time.  It'll all work out.  And I suspect you will really appreciate 12.04
[16:33] <BluesKaj> !pm | malefiku
[16:33] <ubottu> malefiku: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can help you, benefit from your questions and answers, and ensure that you're not getting bad advice. Please note that some people find it rude to be sent a PM without being asked for permission to do so first.
[16:34] <kslater> I have 12.04.1 on a build machine in the basement. I'm not sure about Unity though. I think I laid down gnome on that box to stay comfortable.
[16:34] <IdleOne> malefiku: Just ask your actual question and if someone can help they will.
[16:34] <kslater> (I haven't used it much yet)
[16:36] <demensdeum> Hey ppl, why noveau and nvidia driver freeze my notebook? geforce 8400g
[16:37] <demensdeum> also artefacts
[16:38] <Hans-Martin> most likely nobody knows...
[16:38] <demensdeum> too bad
[16:38] <malefiku> Here is the thing... I had an old blog hosted on Blogger blogspot Google free subdomain... The old address is http://marian32-blog.blogspot.com... Recently, I bought a paid domain called www.marian32.com... But when I access it, points me to..Google !!!!
[16:38] <Hans-Martin> does it completely freeze, or just the graphics?
[16:38] <demensdeum> completely freeze
[16:39] <demensdeum> artifacts on gdm login
[16:39] <XXCoreIII> I ran an update on the system and now flash won't work.
[16:39] <demensdeum> Same on debian.
[16:39] <IdleOne> malefiku: ##networking might be more useful in this case.
[16:39] <demensdeum> As i recall on 8.04 everything was ok
[16:40] <Hans-Martin> demensdeum: maybe the driver gets wrong memory info and either overwrites other data structures or something overwrites its structures?
[16:40] <demensdeum> I don't know how to check
[16:40] <ania_> XXCoreIII, hi are u there?
[16:41] <XXCoreIII> Yes, but I just fixed it.
[16:41] <ania_> XXCoreIII,  flash where ?
[16:41] <Hans-Martin> demensdeum: is it possible to run 8.04 without too much effort to compare kernel output for example?
[16:41] <JPMH> malefiku: I went to your domain - worked fine for me
[16:41] <XXCoreIII> it downloaded flashplugin-installer but didn't run it
[16:42] <demensdeum> <Hans-Martin> good idea. But I don't remember what version of nvidia driver was.
[16:42] <ania_> ok just to let you know easiest way to install and manage flash in firefox is to install firefox add on called FLASH-AID .....and jusgt follow instruction
[16:42] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: have you tried flushing all browser caches?
[16:42] <JPMH> malefiku: in fact I get a status 302 - permanently moved and the re-direct to the blocgsopt.com
[16:42] <jp_hranice> Hallo, I have some problems with fullscreen in games like glebulation 2, warzone2100, on NVIDIA GeForce 6600. Any idea ?
[16:43] <krywk> I got it working with no latenc
[16:43] <JC_SoCal> if i use the mini.iso and want to get to the full ubuntu-server iso version, is there a way like apt-get install ubuntu-desktop install the full ubuntu-desktop iso version
[16:43] <krywk> latency
[16:43] <krywk> :D
[16:43] <JPMH> malefiku: how long is it since you changed the DNS pointers - I wonder if you have a DNS cache issue rather than a browser one - although Hans-Martin  is right too
[16:44] <demensdeum> and its ok on vista, so i think problem in driver somewhere.
[16:44] <malefiku> Yes
[16:44] <blackline> How can I disable the passphrase at boot? I'm running Ubuntu 12.10.
[16:44] <malefiku> Guys, listen up
[16:44] <nimo> i cant bluetooth to my ubuntu machine.. refused.... any suggestions?
[16:44] <rdw200169> JC_SoCal: just use tasksel
[16:44] <malefiku> The website was accessible
[16:45] <beboj> JC_SoCal: just use terminal to install everything
[16:45] <Hans-Martin> demensdeum: it's probably a problem between driver and bios - maybe the bios misreports something about the card, but the windows driver does the right thing anyway, and the linux driver believes what the bios says
[16:45] <malefiku> But the workers from the registrar changed my DNS so many times, that they fucked my domain
[16:45] <JC_SoCal> beboj: Yeah, i just don't know what 'everything' is
[16:46] <JC_SoCal> rdw200169: i'll give tasksel a try thx
[16:46] <rdw200169> JC_SoCal: if you run tasksel in the terminal, there is a 'Ubuntu Desktop' Task, that task should take care of installing everything you need
[16:46] <topper4125> JC_SoCal http://askubuntu.com/questions/150338/ubuntu-server-from-ubuntu-minimal
[16:46] <demensdeum> how to check what drivers get from bios?
[16:46] <beboj> https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/index.html
[16:46] <TheLordOfTime> any way to cut back on the unity visual effects for VM deployment?
[16:47] <JC_SoCal> topper4125: i saw this -- but ubuntu-server wasn't found
[16:47] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: looks like marian32-blog.blogspot.de redirects to marian32.com again
[16:47] <ThinkT510> TheLordOfTime: better off with lubuntu in a vm
[16:47] <malefiku> Yes
[16:47] <Hans-Martin> that's not DNS, just HTTP redirection
[16:47] <JC_SoCal> rdw200169: i'm not looking for ubuntu-desktop, sorry, i need ubuntu-server
[16:47] <malefiku> This is normal
[16:47] <topper4125> JC_SoCal read answer 1... that's the way to get 'er done (Tasksel)
[16:47] <TheLordOfTime> ThinkT510,  no choice, have to test a Unity feature for bugfixing.  so my original question stands.

[16:48] <beboj> install this and after that webmin or something easy to manage
[16:48] <Hans-Martin> and www.marian32.com (173.194.69.132) redirects to www.google.com
[16:48] <ThinkT510> TheLordOfTime: unity wasn't really designed for it
[16:49] <TheLordOfTime> ThinkT510, yeah i know, i had to bugtest a unity thing :P
[16:49] <TheLordOfTime> ThinkT510, it runs fine in a VM if I give it > 1.5GB of RAM
[16:49] <TheLordOfTime> but... :P
[16:49] <rdw200169> JC_SoCal: then pick the server from the list in tasksel...
[16:49] <ThinkT510> TheLordOfTime: you could try disabling some stuff in compiz settings but that can break things, be very careful
[16:49] <TheLordOfTime> ThinkT510, might just install gnome-panel or whatever notunity is
[16:50] <TheLordOfTime> gnome-shell
[16:50] <TheLordOfTime> ;P
[16:51] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: the problem is maybe that www.marian32.com has a CNAME of marian32-blog.blogspot.com but blogspot does not know the domain name marian32.com
[16:52] <ztgu> Why does my laptop have so terrible battery life in linux?
[16:52] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: if your actual blog is now on an external host you need to remove that cname stuff from DNS
[16:52] <JPMH> Hans-Martin:  and malefiku  I do not agree - I did the dig - there is an A record and it points at an apache server that returns the re-direct
[16:52] <graingert> ztgu: have you tried powertop?
[16:52] <malefiku> In my domain settings in Blogger I checked/ticked a small box saying: "redirect marian32.com to www.marian32.com"
[16:52] <ztgu> graingert: yes,
[16:52] <ThinkT510> ztgu: largely depends on the drivers in use
[16:52] <JPMH> what may be the issue is that you are using a more complex URL that is not being re-directed by that server - what URL are you using, be VERY specific
[16:53] <graingert> ztgu: how much shorter is it? What's your graphics card?
=== kmonlinux is now known as aileen
[16:53] <majnoon> ok i was wondering is it possible to ssh into a machine and display a program on THAT box ??
[16:53] <Hans-Martin> marian32-blog.blogspot.com says "Das gesuchte Blog finden Sie nun unter  http://www.marian32.com/."
[16:53] <malefiku> Because Google Blogger does not accept naked domains
[16:53] <malefiku> Like http://example.com
[16:53] <LostMonk> is this a good walkthrough for installing gnome 3.6?
[16:53] <LostMonk> http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-get-complete-gnome-3-desktop-in.html
[16:54] <rethus> i have a home-partition on my desktop and will install the hdd to another pc.
[16:54] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: so as I said, you need to remove the cname record for www.marian32.com
[16:54] <rethus> on the other pc the user-id 1000 is for entwickler. my desktop has suther for 1000
[16:54] <ThinkT510> LostMonk: whats wrong with gnome-shell in the repos?
[16:54] <malefiku> When you type marian32.com it actually appears in your browser www.marian32.con
[16:54] <malefiku> .com*
[16:54] <JPMH> Hans-Martin: why am I not seeing a CNAME record when I do a dig
[16:54] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: because that essentially creates a circular redirection thing
[16:55] <rethus> how can i change the new system from user "entwickler" to "suther" so that i didn't need to change the permissions on my home-partition of my desktop-hdd?
[16:55] <ztgu> graingert: I have an A10 cpu with integrated GPU + a radeon hd 7730M, I use vga_switcheroo to disable my inactive powerful GPU, the diffrence is 10 watts. tested with powerstat
[16:55] <malefiku> It is a redirect from naked to non nakex domain
[16:55] <malefiku> non-naked*
[16:55] <Hans-Martin> jpmh: did you run "dig www.marian32.com any"?
[16:55] <graingert> ztgu: looks like you know better than I do. Perhaps you're having issues with the linux power regression?
[16:55] <JPMH> Hans-Martin: and malefiku skip that - I see he has the CNAME for the www.marian32.com - I did the marian32 without the www - I agree - need to set that CNAME to point at the main one or get rid of it and have an A
[16:56] <M4532098> Hey
[16:56] <malefiku> Here are the 3 DNS Records settings I currently perform at my domain registrar, onlydomains.com
[16:56] <M4532098> I need help. How do install Ubuntu alongside windows using the ubuntu installer? (Wubi.exe)
[16:56] <malefiku> Check them out
[16:57] <ztgu> graingert: I am going to make a script which dissable NMI watchdog, when on battery. including the ethernetcard and others
[16:57] <demensdeum> <M4532098> lol just install it
[16:57] <k1l> M4532098: i would recommend not to use a wubi install
[16:57] <gar_onn> M4532098, have you already downloaded it?
[16:57] <malefiku> The first one is www CNAME marian32-blog.blogspot.com
[16:58] <ztgu> graingert: Audio codec hwC0D0: ATI. Thing uses a lot of power. (powertop)
[16:58] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: that one is already nonsense. You need to point www to A 184.95.38.200
[16:58] <usr13> M4532098: wubi is not for installing alongside windows, it is for just installing a psuedo Ubuntu INSIDE windows, (just on the ntfs filesystem).  You need the regular Ubuntu install CD (or USB), to install alongside windows, (and have a dual boot system).
[16:58] <malefiku> www A 184.95.38.200
[16:58] <malefiku> And @ A 184.95.38.200
[16:58] <malefiku> What is wrong here?
[16:58] <srhb> Despite having set vm writeback timeout to 10 minutes, I keep seeing kB written in iostat every few seconds. What's going on? Why is it writing prematurely?
[16:59] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: yes, or CNAME www.marian32.com
[16:59] <malefiku> Like this www CNAME www.marian32.com
[16:59] <malefiku> Or what?
[16:59] <Hans-Martin> www should only have the A record, not cname
[17:00] <malefiku> Allright
[17:00] <malefiku> And the CNAME?
[17:00] <malefiku> Should i delete it?
[17:00] <usr13> malefiku: Hans-Martin YOu guys should move to private chanel.
[17:00] <Hans-Martin> www CNAME www.marian32.com would be a direct cycle, don't do that :-)
[17:00] <Hans-Martin> yes, delete the CNAME
[17:00] <JPMH> malefiku: have you told blogspot odf your domain - if not the CNAME will send you there but the host: line in the request will have your domain and they may not know what to do with it
[17:00] <malefiku> JPMH
[17:00] <malefiku> I have Google Webmaster
[17:01] <malefiku> The settings there work fine
[17:01] <Skei> Morning. My laptop keyboard has mostly stopped working, randomly. The tab key still works, I can still Ctrl + Alt + F1 and use the keyboard there, but under X, it's mostly unresponsive. Does anyone know how I can restart it without killing X ? My mouse occasionally does the same, I use modprobe to fix that.
[17:01] <Hans-Martin> JPMH: blogspot does a HTML redirection to www.marian32.com, that should be enough. No need to fix anything there.
[17:01] <Skei> External USB keyboards work fine, as an addition.
[17:02] <JPMH> Hans-Martin: thank you - was not certain what they did with a host: that was not them - but to do the re-direction he needs to have told them doesn't he?
[17:02] <malefiku> But if i delete the CNAME, it appears another trick/problem... My mobile website, located here www.marian32/?m=1(is visible only from the phone), does not work anymore
[17:03] <malefiku> :((((
[17:03] <Hans-Martin> JPMH: yup, but he already did if I understood correctly
[17:03] <Hans-Martin> for www you nneed to have the A record. do you have it?
[17:04] <JPMH> Hans-Martin: then I agree with you - if it is already done
[17:05] <JPMH> Hans-Martin: I run hundreds of domains I do not set A records for the www.  I set CNAME records for www to point at the main one.  Or, if I want all subdomains then I do a *. and an A
[17:05] <Hans-Martin> JPMH: that's also ok, in this case I had the impression that the www... was the main name
[17:06] <Skei> Actually, it looks like the keyboard is working, but it's just responding extremely slowly. If I hold down letters, I can eventually type.
[17:06] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: at the moment the DNS has not changed yet - why do you think it does not work anymore?
[17:06] <JPMH> Hans-Martin: I think I agree with you - actually I think we are saying exactly the same things all along
[17:07] <Hans-Martin> JPMH: good :-)
[17:08] <malefiku> Allright
[17:08] <malefiku> Deleted the old CNAME setting that pointed to old blogspot subdomain
[17:08] <malefiku> My blogspot old address is hosted at google
[17:08] <anonymous_> hmm
[17:09] <malefiku> I do not own a hosting service
[17:09] <anonymous_> i know a good hosting service
[17:09] <malefiku> Because i don't have access to blog database
[17:09] <malefiku> I don't own php admin
[17:10] <malefiku> The blog is still hosted by Blogger.com
[17:10] <anonymous_> check out galliumgroup.net
[17:10] <domedagen> How do I launch this "script" as su
[17:10] <domedagen> named install
[17:10] <malefiku> The only thing I changed is the address typed in the search bar
[17:10] <gvo> domedagen: sudo named install
[17:11] <domedagen> gvo: named?
[17:11] <malefiku> Instead of marian32-blog.blogspot.com it appeared marian32.com
[17:11] <gvo> What was your question?
[17:11] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: ah, that was not clear. I though you had changed the hosting with the address, and just pointed the old blogspot site to the new address
[17:11] <malefiku> No
[17:11] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: so everything we did was nonsense :-)
[17:11] <malefiku> I own only the domain service, the hosting is not included
[17:12] <malefiku> Yes
[17:12] <anonymous_> galliumgroup.net offer sweet hosting
[17:12] <domedagen> gvo:!
[17:12] <malefiku> But I had a big problem a few weeks ago
[17:12] <domedagen> gvo: !
[17:12] <malefiku> With the settings i have now
[17:13] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: since blogspot.com probably can't be convinced to accept your domain name, the whole thing likely cannot work the way you intended.
[17:13] <gvo> domedagen: I don't follow you.
[17:13] <malefiku> The two A records, www and @ , my mobile version of my blog does not work
[17:13] <gvo> domedagen: you asked a question, I aswered it you then said something unintelligible SOrry I can't hel[
[17:13] <gvo> help
[17:13] <malefiku> HANS-MARTIN, the domain worked 4 days ago
[17:13] <anonymous_> if you need a host check out  galliumgroup.net
[17:14] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: then what did change?
[17:14] <malefiku> For what?
[17:14] <JPMH> malefiku: Hans-Martin He could use the re-direct method that is there for the non-www and find a free host that would support the ONE page he would need for the re-direct
[17:14] <malefiku> The DNS got fucked up
[17:14] <Hans-Martin> JPMH: right
[17:15] <malefiku> The workers from technical department at onlydomains fucked my DNS over 30 times
[17:15] <TheLordOfTime> malefiku, please don't use that kind of foul language here.
[17:15] <malefiku> TheLordOfTime, copy that
[17:15] <gvo> malefiku: Just find another service.
[17:16] <JPMH> malefiku: look at the non-www record - it points to a server somewhere that is doing the re-direct - just set the www. to have a CNAME that points it at the non-www and make sure that the re-direct is what you want
[17:16] <malefiku> All right
[17:16] <malefiku> But in my onlydomains.com panel
[17:17] <JPMH> malefiku: does the domain registery provide the DNS that you are using?  If so, surely they have a web interface where you can change that www. record to be a CNAME pointing at the main one
[17:17] <malefiku> At my registrar, beneath the DNS section I have an option called Setup Web Redirection
[17:17] <malefiku> It has two option 302 temporary
[17:18] <malefiku> And 301 permanent
[17:18] <malefiku> I have also, after DNS records, a 301 redirection
[17:18] <JPMH> malefiku: and I suspect you did the permanent for the non-www which is why Is aw what I saw
[17:18] <malefiku> From www.marian32.com to marian32-blog.blogspot.com
[17:19] <JPMH> malefiku: the issue is that you did not do it for the www one
[17:19] <malefiku> No, JPMH
[17:19] <malefiku> Read carefully what I wrote
[17:19] <malefiku> I made a 301 redirect
[17:20] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: so you need the web redirection, but not the cname, and you need to remove the redirection set up at blogger.com
[17:20] <malefiku> But not from www.marian32.com to marian32.com
[17:20] <malefiku> But to marian32-blog.blogspot.com
[17:20] <JPMH> malefiku: as I say - I see the redirect and the correct DNS A record for the non-www  - but the www is different - as Hans-Martin  pointed out - it has a CNAME record
[17:21] <malefiku> If I make the following A setting: marian32.com A 162.239.32.21
[17:21] <anonymous_> http://www.galliumgroup.net - NOW ACCEPTING BITCOIN!
[17:21] <JPMH> malefiku: I c u changed it - I now get the same A record for both

[17:30] <gotwig> why cant I upgrade from e.g 11.10 to 12.10?
[17:30] <seednode> Depends what you'll be doing with it; I use 2 NIC on my laptop, but I'm not that knowledgeable about it beyond basics.
[17:31] <JPMH> gotwig: it is just the way they did it  - a pain I agree - you can go to LTS releases or the next one - 12.10 is not an LTS
[17:32] <jchamb2010> @seednode it's an internal and external network setup, I posted about it here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2100344 but then thought this would be a better place to ask.
[17:32] <gotwig> JPMH, I know..
[17:32] <gotwig> lts takes too long
[17:33] <JPMH> gotwig: I agree with you - it is a pain

[17:33] <pats_Toms> hi, I have interesting problem, I have alsa-base, alsa-utils. But I can't run alsamixer
[17:33] <pats_Toms> "cannot open mixer: No such file or directory" on alsamixer
[17:35] <gotwig> JPMH, can't I just change the distro name in source.list, and than upgrade packages?
[17:35] <theadmin> gotwig: Bad idea.
[17:35] <gotwig> warum
[17:35] <jhutchins_wk> pats_Toms: I'm guessing maybe you don't have permission to access /dev/dsp
[17:35] <JPMH> gotwig: I doubt that it will work - but worth a try - the reason I doubt it is that if it was that easy others would have suggested it on the web
[17:35] <theadmin> gotwig: It might work, but packages may have changed names, just for example.
[17:36] <theadmin> There's a ton of other potential issues I don't want to bother to think about
[17:36] <mokujin> здравствуйте
[17:36] <theadmin> gotwig: What's the problem with a simple "do-release-upgrade" anyway
[17:36] <theadmin> !ru | mokujin
[17:36] <mokujin> есть русскоговорящие профессионалы убунту ?
[17:36] <ubottu> mokujin: Пожалуйста наберите /join #ubuntu-ru для получения помощи на русском языке. | Pozhalujsta naberite /join #ubuntu-ru dlya polucheniya pomoshi na russkom yazyke.
[17:36] <jhutchins_wk> gotwig: Make sure the system is completely up to date before you upgrade, disable all ppms first.
[17:36] <gotwig> theadmin, cant upgrade from 11.10 to 12.10
[17:36] <demensdeum> нету
[17:36] <theadmin> gotwig: Yeah not directly, sadly
[17:36] <pats_Toms> jhutchins_wk: I need to add my user to audio group?
[17:36] <jhutchins_wk> gotwig: Yeah, you usually need to step through each version.
[17:37] <malefiku> Here is the thing
[17:37] <jhutchins_wk> pats_Toms: Possibly, possibly just log out and log back in, it should add the default user when it's set up.
[17:37] <malefiku> If I put www CNAME ghs.google.com ????
[17:37] <JPMH> gotwig: with the time we are spending here discussing it you could have upgraded unless you have a REALLY slow connection
[17:37] <Gnea> gotwig: just upgrade to 12.04 then upgrade it to 12.10
[17:37] <greg> hi
[17:37] <gotwig> I talk about theory..
[17:38] <gotwig> I dont have to upgrade.. but I have some ideas in mind
[17:38] <Gnea> theory is not practical
[17:38] <JPMH> malefiku: where do you REALLY want me to be taken when I selevct www.marian32.com - do you want to go directky to blogspot and have you told them that this is an alias to your account there
[17:38] <malefiku> Hans-Martin, JPMH what is your opinion?
[17:38] <gotwig> when someone wants to build a spinoff of ubuntu, he would have to use every lts release, to offer upgrades...
[17:38] <Gnea> gotwig: well, we're here to discuss support options. #ubuntu-discuss is probably a better place for what you wish to talk about.
[17:38] <malefiku> To my blog
[17:39] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: it depends on google understanding your domain name.
[17:39] <mokujin>  /join #ubuntu-ru
[17:39] <gotwig> thx you very much
[17:39] <Hans-Martin> if they don't interpret it correctly, it won't work
=== greg is now known as pllX
[17:39] <theadmin> mokujin: No spaces in front
[17:39] <malefiku> When you type www.marian32.com, you should be pointed to my blog old blogspot

[17:39] <malefiku> Hosted on Blogger
[17:40] <gotwig> mokujin, checkout #ubuntu-ru for Russian help
[17:40] <malefiku> Ok
[17:40] <JPMH> malefiku: and when you say your blog - do you mean at blogspot ?  If so, are they willing to allow access via YOUR domain name,  If so, just set the A record to point to them.  If they do not offer this then set your A to point somewhere that will do a redirect to your specific entry at blogspot
[17:40] <malefiku> If i change to ghs.google.com
[17:41] <malefiku> You won't see the question to redirect, when you access the old blogspot address
[17:41] <pats_Toms> jhutchins_wk: do you know something about that? http://sprunge.us/TefC
[17:41] <JPMH> malefiku: why do you want to get google involved?
[17:41] <pats_Toms> jhutchins_wk: I had the same on some alsa commands too
[17:41] <theadmin> pats_Toms: sudo useradd
[17:41] <malefiku> Lol
[17:41] <theadmin> pats_Toms: Also, use adduser
[17:42] <malefiku> JMPH, i feel like I am at FBI or RIS investigation
[17:42] <JPMH> malefiku: does blogspot allow you to access via your domain name and by so doing re-direct to your blog - if they do - then do that - if they don;t then you need to re-direct or possibly cloak
[17:42] <malefiku> Yes
[17:42] <malefiku> In my blogspot settings, I had option to add my custom domain
[17:43] <malefiku> And I added
[17:43] <malefiku> I feel like I am at RIS ( Romanian Intelligence Service)
[17:43] <Error404NotFound> If i am using dnscrypt dns queries shouldn't appear as plain text in tcpdump/wireshark logs, right?
[17:43] <malefiku> :)))))
[17:44] <pats_Toms> ehh, thats so bad
[17:44] <theadmin> Error404NotFound: Well, I'm not too sure what dnscrypt is, but being logical, I suppose so.
[17:45] <JPMH> malefiku: then why are you getting google involved?  As it happens it looked to me as though you told blogspot to re-direct AWAY from them to your new domain
[17:45] <malefiku> No
[17:45] <Error404NotFound> theadmin: dnscrypt is a tool from opendns to move to encrypted dns queries. Unfortunately i can see the queries in plain text in tcpdump/wireshark.
[17:46] <malefiku> I want my domain name address to display the blog
[17:46] <Hans-Martin> JPMH: but that's not what he intended. He wanted to keep the blog on blogspot.com but have it accessible under a nother domain name
[17:46] <malefiku> Hosted at Google
[17:46] <malefiku> Yes, Hans-Martin, finally you got it
[17:46] <Hans-Martin> blogspot = blogger.com = google
[17:47] <malefiku> Blogspot is a subdomain address, I changed with a professional domain
[17:47] <Hans-Martin> malefiku: it took me a while but I did get it some lines ago already :-) But the thing is that your config at blogspot.com seems to be confused
[17:47] <user109125> how many clipboards does ubuntu 12.10 use? oO now I figured out I can paste the correct content with ctrl + shift + ins, but not with ctrl+shift, not with middle mouse, not with right click paste, not with ctrl+v
[17:47] <malefiku> Yes
[17:47] <JPMH> Hans-Martin: and malefiku I agree - and that is why I do not understand why he is getting GOOGLE into this.  He wants to use HIS domain as an alias to blogspot.  He needs to tell blogspot that his domain connects to HIS blog - of they will allow that
[17:47] <malefiku> Perhaps
[17:48] <jrib> user109125: not with just "shift-insert"?
[17:48] <JPMH> malefiku: and Hans-Martin and he has set his blog to re-direct us to marian32.com - NOT what he wants
[17:49] <user109125> shift+insert has another clipboard string saved
[17:49] <Em_> Hi, I'm pretty new to Ubuntu. How can I determine if all my hardware drivers are installed? Does ubuntu have a device manager like in Windows? Or what command will I need to type in on the terminal to verify if my hardware drivers are installed?
[17:49] <jrib> user109125: does your ctrl-shift-insert work outside of libreoffice?  Like in gedit?
[17:49] <user109125> s/ctrl+shift/shift+insert/
[17:49] <user109125> yes
[17:49] <jrib> user109125: weird :)
[17:50] <user109125> no, it does not work in libreoffice. there shift+insert works
[17:50] <Muphrid> Em_: are you using 12.10?
=== angelpossum is now known as vegeta
[17:50] <Em_> Muphrid: Yeah
[17:50] <jrib> user109125: oh, I thought you meant openoffice when you said Oo
=== vegeta is now known as Guest85201
=== Guest85201 is now known as angelpossum
[17:51] <jrib> user109125: where does ctrl-shift-insert work?
[17:51] <Muphrid> Em_: you can open software-properties-gtk or search for "software sources" in the dash. theres a tab called additional drivers, those are the drivers that do not come installed by default
[17:51] <Muphrid> otherwise they come installed
[17:51] <user109125> jrib:  works in terminal
[17:51] <jrib> user109125: anywhere outside terminal?
=== angelpossum is now known as genimpa
[17:52] <user109125> not that I noticed of. . not in gedit, not in libreoffice
[17:52] <Em_> @Muphrid: Is there like an easy way to determine if my hardware drivers are installed? Without to need to go over a long list of which drivers did not com installed by default
[17:52] <jrib> user109125: and you're sure it's not the same output as either ctrl-shift-v or shift-insert in your terminal?
[17:53] <Muphrid> Em_: the list is not long, it is no more than 5 or 6 for most machines
[17:53] <user109125> yes, absolutely
[17:53] <user109125> im copying out of keepass2 .. probably that's the cause of that weird behaviour
[17:54] <jrib> user109125: here, ctrl-shift-insert just pastes whatever I copy with ctrl-shift-c (which I can also paste with ctrl-shift-v)
[17:54] <Em_> Muphrid, so If my hardware drivers are not listed, then it would mean that they are installed right?
=== genimpa is now known as angelpossum
[17:54] <sporkubus> hey guys, I'm trying to install ubuntu 12.10 on my macbook pro running mountain lion and i'm not having any luck :(
[17:54] <Muphrid> Em_: if all is working, yes, they have a free license and are included in the kernel or the display protocol
[17:54] <Em_> Muphrid: Assuming that they aren't, how do I install them?
[17:55] <Muphrid> ATI drivers however dont show up in 12.10 although theyre not installed
[17:55] <malefiku> You should see it tommorrow

[17:55] <user109125> sporkubus, whats the problem?
[17:56] <Muphrid> Em_: usually you can either search for a binary in the manufacturer website
[17:56] <Muphrid> forget the "either"
[17:56] <FlowRiser> in 24 hours 13.04 gets released ?

[17:57] <Mongolski> hej
[17:57] <sporkubus> I tried following the instructions on the website
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest81205
[17:57] <sporkubus> I also tried a few guides in different places on the internet
[17:58] <Muphrid> Em_: if you want to install a realtek driver, go to the realtek website, search for your card and then look for a linux executable, much like you would do in windows
[17:58] <sporkubus> mac won't recognize the Ubuntu install disc
[17:58] <Em_> @Muphrid: What if there aren't?
[17:58] <nashant> Anyone know how long it should take to pvmove a 2tb disk?
[17:58] <sporkubus> i tried burning it on several different computers and installed reFit, no luck
[17:58] <jrib> sporkubus: you used to need to hold down some key (was it 'c') during boot
[17:58] <Muphrid> Em_: worst case scenario a linux port isnt available
[17:58] <sporkubus> jrib: did that, the Ubuntu disc doesn't show up
[17:58] <Muphrid> are you trying anything specific, or just out of curiosity?
[17:58] <jrib> sporkubus: checksum your cd
[17:58] <FlowRiser> nashant, depends on the disk speed
[17:59] <user109125> I should switch to KeePassX, seems to copy anything properly without issues
[17:59] <sporkubus> jrib, how do I do that

[17:59] <ubottu> sporkubus: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[17:59] <Ronalds_M> hello everyone
[17:59] <Em_> @Muphrid, cause I recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my Lenovo G480 notebook, but I don't think all of its drivers are installed.
[17:59] <topper4125> sporkubus did you verify the md5 of the download?\
[17:59] <nashant> FlowRiser: sata II
[17:59] <jrib> sporkubus: also, you burned the image meant for macs?
[17:59] <Muphrid> Em_: why do you think that?
[17:59] <sporkubus> jrib I burned the one on the ubuntu website
[17:59] <FlowRiser> !sata2
[17:59] <sporkubus> where is the one meant for macs
[18:00] <Ronalds_M> I have ubuntu 12.10, and Nexuiz, just started to stop working, I can't start it
[18:00] <Em_> @Muphrid, When I connected my ethernet cable to the ethernet port, the Internet connection icon located on the upper right corner does not show or indicate it is connected to the Internet.
[18:00] <jrib> sporkubus: http://releases.ubuntu.com/quantal/ see the "Mac" images there
[18:00] <JPMH> how will Ubuntu operate with the new WINDOZE 8 certified PCS that insist on a signed (my the evil empire) loader
[18:00] <Muphrid> Em_: but is it connected either way?
[18:01] <graingert> JPMH: should work fine from 13.04 onwards
[18:01] <Ronalds_M> "nexuiz
[18:01] <Ronalds_M> Game is Nexuiz using base gamedir data
[18:01] <Ronalds_M> Nexuiz Linux 06:05:17 Feb 13 2012 0~20110628+svn11619-2 Ubuntu

[18:01] <Em_> Muphrid: It also gave me an error message regarding my display saying that something is wrong with my GPU or something.
[18:01] <topper4125> sporkubus, http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/burn-a-dvd-on-mac-osx

[18:01] <sporkubus> topper4125 I followed those instructions
[18:01] <graingert> JPMH: those platforms are controlled like iPads
[18:01] <Em_> Muphrid: Well, when I boot up in Windows, I can connect to the Internet. But in Ubuntu, I can't.
[18:01] <graingert> :(
[18:01] <JPMH> graingert: yes - but how - are they getting MS to sign the Ubuntu loader?
[18:01] <stef1a> my sound doesn't work in ubuntu 12.10 and i've tried using the ubuntu troubleshooting guide
[18:02] <topper4125> and what happens... where does it get stuck?
[18:02] <graingert> JPMH: the linux foundation have a bootloader that was signed
[18:02] <sporkubus> after burning it says "The disc you inserted was not readable by this computer" and ejects it
[18:02] <Em_> Muphrid: It also doesn't have sound.
[18:02] <sporkubus> I also tried burning the disc using a windows computer, inserted it into my mac and it did the same thing
[18:02] <Em_> Muphrid: So I'm plannign to go to a Wi-Fi hotspot later and see if I could connect wirelessly.
[18:02] <graingert> JPMH: http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/blogs/browse/2012/10/linux-foundation-uefi-secure-boot-system-open-source
[18:03] <JPMH> graingert: ty - is it like a wedge that loads itself and then allows anything else to be loaded as the chain loading of Grub allows?
[18:03] <topper4125> sporkubus, did you verify the iso image?
[18:03] <sporkubus> topper4125 how do I do that
[18:03] <Muphrid> Em_: ive never seen the first two problems. did you have sound before or it never occurred?
[18:03] <sporkubus> is that the checksum thing you mentioned
[18:03] <topper4125> !verify | sporkubus
[18:03] <ubottu> sporkubus: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[18:03] <stef1a> can someone help me with my sound? it's not working, though the earbuds work
[18:03] <topper4125> yup
[18:04] <Ronalds_M> anybody knows why nexuiz suddenly could stop from working?
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest5782
[18:04] <Em_> Muphrid: It never occured. I'm thinking, maybe I just need to update the kernel uh . . . I don't know I'm really not sure. Is there a command I could type in on the terminal to download all the packages needed to update the kernel?
[18:04] <sporkubus> topper 4125 those instructions say
[18:05] <Em_> Muphrid: I was hoping that I could connect wirelessly and update the kernel and that will resolve the issue.
[18:05] <sporkubus> "Go to the "Images" menu and select Checksum > MD5. Be sure to choose "MD5" and NOT "MD5 image checksum" or "CRC-32 image checksum", as they are not the same and will give you different results. " but I don't have the MD5 option
[18:05] <ztgu> I am trying to compile "ndiswrapper" but when I type make I get error. How can I fix this error?
[18:05] <graingert> JPMH: yeah
[18:05] <Muphrid> Em_: you should check if any driver is listed in software-properties-gtk
[18:05] <JPMH> graingert: that URL you gave me IS GREAT!  Thank you so much
[18:06] <Em_> Muphrid: What does it mean if it is?
[18:06] <Muphrid> Em_: they have a button for activation, thought you will need internet to download it. But it gives more information for debugging
[18:06] <graingert> JPMH: microsoft accidentally signed it anyway! http://blog.hansenpartnership.com/adventures-in-microsoft-uefi-signing/
[18:06] <topper4125> sporkubus, are you using the mac now, or a windows machine?
[18:07] <sporkubus> topper4125 using mac now.. hold on I think I figured it out
[18:07] <Muphrid> though*
[18:07] <Em_> Muphrid: Thanks for your assistance, I really appreciate it. I'll try that command later on.
[18:07] <sporkubus> topper4125 the hash matches exactly
[18:08] <sporkubus> so somebody else said I need to download a different ISO for mac
[18:08] <sporkubus> i'm using  ubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386.iso
[18:08] <graingert> JPMH: “Don’t use that file that is incorrectly signed. I will get back to you.”  said microsoft
[18:08] <jrib> sporkubus: yes, that's not going to work...
[18:08] <topper4125> sporkubus, k... that's odd the desktop download should work... do you have a USB Stick available?
[18:08] <MonkeyDust> !mac > sporkubus
[18:08] <ubottu> sporkubus, please see my private message
[18:08] <graingert> JPMH: they signed it with an unrevokeable generic microsoft key
[18:09] <graingert> JPMH: (morons)
[18:09] <ztgu> what more than build-essential does one need to compile programs?
[18:09] <JPMH> graingert: it is not an issue for me at this time.  In the event that I buy a machine that is Windoze 8 certified I will disable the secure boot anyway
[18:09] <FlowRiser> QUESTION: What is the purpose of the countdown on ubuntu.com ?
[18:09] <jrib> FlowRiser: we don't know.  Feel free to speculate in #ubuntu-offtopic
[18:09] <topper4125> sporkubus, might want to give a USB install a try: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx
[18:09] <JPMH> FlowRiser: someone here said that 13.04 will be out shortly - makes no sense since it is only 13.01 but maybe a pre-release
[18:10] <ztgu> FlowRiser: new ubuntu
[18:10] <sporkubus> topper4125 tried usb install... when i reboot, reFit doesn't see the usb
[18:10] <sporkubus> MonkeyDust that guide doesn't have 12.10 instructions for my mac version
[18:10] <sporkubus> MonkeyDust actually I don't even see my macbook on that page
[18:10] <topper4125> wow.. then i'm out of ideas... sorry sporkubus. :(
[18:10] <graingert> JPMH: well it's handy. All the Loader.c is doing is making it more user friendly for users.
[18:11] <jrib> sporkubus: why don't you burn the "amd64 Mac" version?
[18:11] <graingert> JPMH: you can manually add the signatures to your own UEFI repo
[18:11] <sporkubus> jrib yes I was about to ask you about that
[18:11] <topper4125> which mac are you trying to install it on?
[18:11] <sporkubus> early 2011 macbook pro
[18:11] <JPMH> graingert: I agree - having read the page you gave me I like what they are doing
[18:11] <graingert> JPMH: you may as well keep it, it's a useful feature
[18:11] <ztgu> what more than build-essential does one need to compile programs?
[18:11] <FlowRiser> ztgu, yes, build-essential will cover most needs
[18:11] <jrib> ztgu: the dependencies of the program you are compiling.  What are you compiling?
[18:11] <sporkubus> jrib OK, I am downloading it now. so I just follow the regular DVD burn instructions and it should work?
[18:11] <jrib> sporkubus: yes
[18:12] <FlowRiser> ztgu, cpp, c, python and other compilers
[18:12] <ztgu> jrib, FlowRiser : I am trying to compile ndiswrapper.
[18:12] <theadmin> ztgu: Why would you? That's in the repos.
[18:12] <FlowRiser> ztgu, should do the trick, it's in c
[18:13] <ztgu> theadmin: I need to know compiling
[18:13] <jrib> ztgu: use apt, it's in the repositories as theadmin pointed out
[18:13] <theadmin> ztgu: Ha, fair enough
[18:13] <JPMH> graingert: what use is it to me?
[18:13] <graingert> JPMH: it's much harder to rootkit your box
[18:13] <topper4125> sporkubus, about the only thing I found was: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro and check the wiki links at the bottom.
[18:14] <graingert> JPMH: as you can't flash the bios and get away with it
[18:14] <JPMH> graingert: realistically if I do not indulge in dangerous behavoir I do not see how I am likely to get a rootkit anyway
[18:15] <JPMH> graingert: how does it stop a bios flash happening?
[18:23] <LostMonk> whoops
[18:23] <LostMonk> someone kicked a plug :OP
[18:24] <LostMonk> if I am running cairo, how do I make it start automatically on boot?
[18:24] <ztgu> Can I install all drivers from here http://www.asus.com/Notebooks/Multimedia_Entertainment/N56DP/#download   by using ndiswrapper?
[18:26] <bekks> ztgu: No.
[18:27] <graingert> JPMH: what was the last message you got from me?
[18:27] <ztgu> bekks: how?
[18:28] <JPMH> graingert: last message I received from you was telling me that it stopped flashing the bios - and I asked why and heard no more
[18:28] <bekks> ztgu: ndiswrapper is for networking only, so you cant user other drivers with it.
[18:28] <graingert> JPMH: you're not likely to get a virus. But the cost/risk is worth it. You just need to accept Ubuntu's signing key via the Loader.c interface and off you go
[18:29] <graingert> then you can just leave it alone
[18:29] <ztgu> bekks: ty
[18:29] <graingert> it's not worth disabling it
[18:29] <graingert> although Canonical might get the Ubuntu loader signed themselves.
[18:29] <graingert> Loader.c is aimed at low funding Linux distros
[18:29] <graingert> JPMH: sorry not the bios, I meant people can't just attack the bootloader
[18:29] <graingert> of your OS
[18:29] <JPMH> yep - I do see that it is a GREAT solution - I could even use it for the distro that I make and use in my coffee shops and bars
[18:30] <JPMH> graingert: OK - that makes sense - I did not understand how it could protect the BIOS
[18:30] <graingert> JPMH: well in UEFI the bios is fully protected, as there is not one
[18:30] <graingert> I missspoke
[18:31] <JuJuBee> Is  linuxmint same as ubuntu?
[18:31] <JPMH> graingert: I guessed as much and wanted to confirm - as it happens I can not imagine buying a Windoze8 certified machine for some time
[18:32] <Hans-Martin> JuJuBee: as far as I know mint is based on ubuntu, so they are similar, but it's not the same thing
[18:32] <topper4125> JujuBee, Linux Mint is a spin off of Ubuntu.. about the same as ubuntu is a spin off of  Debian
[18:33] <JuJuBee> Hans-Martin: thanks for that.  I was considering trying it out and when I went to downloads, I see all the Ubuntu names as the base package for mint
[18:34] <Hans-Martin> JuJuBee: best would be to read web pages comparing the two, then you get a broader view than here :-)
[18:34] <topper4125> my only problem with mint is the political views of the creator of it
[18:34] <JuJuBee> Hans-Martin: thanks will look at them
[18:34] <nima__> hey
[18:35] <nima__> i have a problem flashing
[18:35] <nima__> recovery
[18:35] <nima__> via terminal
[18:35] <nima__> in android
[18:35] <theadmin> nima__: #android is the place
[18:35] <nima__> i have fastboot drivers but it doesn't recognize it!
[18:36] <nima__> what do you mean?!
[18:36] <nima__> android is an Os!
[18:36] <Hans-Martin> nima__: in what sense is this an ubuntu problem if you have problems with flashing android?
[18:36] <theadmin> nima__: Duh, this isn't an Ubuntu problem though. Go to #android.
[18:36] <nima__> ok!
[18:36] <nima__> tnx
[18:37] <Hans-Martin> nima__: or do you use an ubuntu host to flash your phone?
[18:38] <theadmin> Hans-Martin: That wouldn't matter. Fastboot and things like that aren't supported by Ubuntu anyway.
[18:38] <theadmin> Well, as in, they're not in the repos, so can't help much with them
[18:39] <loganrun> how to I connect to a printer shared via cups on ubuntu, on another system I don't see the shared printer
[18:40] <loganrun> When I click on the printer in the server I see: usb://HP/LaserJet%201320%20series?serial=00CNHC61Q4WM
[18:40] <loganrun> but I don't understand why it is not visible on the network
[18:40] <loganrun> this seems like a pretty basic thing that ubunutu should support
[18:42] <bekks> loganrun: Because you did not share it with samba, but just configured the printer?
[18:42] <llutz> loganrun: "grep Browsing /etc/cups/cupsd.conf"
[18:42] <loganrun> bekks, I used cups to share the printer,
[18:43] <loganrun> what the heck does the share printer option on cups do then
[18:43] <bekks> loganrun: I just asked what you did...
[18:43] <llutz> loganrun: no need for samba to share cups-printers
[18:43] <Hans-Martin> loganrun: If you used cups to share it but it is not visible chances are good that you did something wrong. But we don't know what.
[18:44] <loganrun> don't know what either, the printer works locallally, and there is only one box to check for sharing
[18:44] <llutz> loganrun:check  "grep Browsing /etc/cups/cupsd.conf"   on or off?
[18:44] <loganrun> is it shared via samba or does it use Bonjour or soemthing
[18:44] <Hans-Martin> is the other system ubuntu or windows?
[18:44] <loganrun> ubuntu
[18:45] <loganrun> I do have a samba server running on the system for files, will that be in conflict with cups sharing
[18:45] <loganrun> how do I bring up the firewall configuratino gui over ssh with x forwarding
[18:46] <paull> hello can anyone tell me why after i have installed ubuntu on my laptop my laptop's fan runs like non-stop
[18:46] <loganrun> tried system-config-firewall but that doesn't seem to exist
[18:46] <MonkeyDust> loganrun  firestarter or gufw
[18:46] <topper4125> paull, laptop make/model?
[18:46] <jhutchins_wk> Samba can make the printer visible via WINS browsing and may offer an smb connection.  Windows is capable of discovering and using printers using other types of sharing, including web and ip print protocols.
[18:46] <paull> dell inspiron 5110
[18:47] <llutz> loganrun: last attempt: check  "grep Browsing /etc/cups/cupsd.conf"   is it on or off?
[18:47] <paull> it's not even model related or anything actually i have seen many threads about this issue but the methods of fixing this issue didnt work for me
[18:47] <loganrun> Jhlorn, how does cups share printers with the share box?
[18:48] <paull> do you think it could be because i installed ubuntu inside windows with wubi?
[18:48] <topper4125> paull, that could be maybe try: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1884876 start reading at post #5
[18:49] <paull> k let me see
[18:50] <topper4125> paull, post #9 has a link to a solve for battery and fan issues
[18:50] <loganrun> there used to be  a firewall configuration gui built into ubuntu I thought, something like system-config-firewall
[18:50] <loganrun> can't find that anymore
[18:51] <jrib> loganrun: gufw?
[18:51] <loganrun> jrib, yeah, tried that, but it doesn' seem like it shows the existing rules
[18:51] <topper4125> !firewall
[18:51] <ubottu> Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.
[18:51] <jrib> loganrun: how did you set the existing rules?
[18:52] <loganrun> jrib, actually it doesn't let me do anything, stragnge ran it as dudo gufw
[18:52] <jrib> loganrun: you should use "gksudo" for graphical applications
[18:52] <topper4125> !gksu
[18:52] <ubottu> If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[18:52] <jrib> (though it probably won't change what you see)
[18:55] <loganrun> o.k. tried sudo ufw disable, and tried checking for printers on my client machine, but still can't see the one shared via cups
[18:55] <loganrun> maybe I need to restart cups or something
[18:56] <loganrun> nope still no good

[19:14] <SnowBro-> haha sorry
[19:14] <SnowBro-> that dont sound good right
[19:15] <SnowBro-> i mean, i need to made a virtual host, something like that, so i can access the server from outside my network
[19:15] <dagerik> SnowBro-: you are probably NAT-ed, so people from outside cant access your server.
[19:15] <bekks> SnowBro-: You also need a portforwarding on your router.
[19:16] <rckrd> hey guys, i posted this in #ubuntu-server, but no responses.  Maybe someone can help me: hey guys, so i've have a small personal server and i want to use it for a few different things (development, music server, etc).  Whats the best way to keep these functions separate?  Virtual machines?  Or just different users and groups?
[19:16] <Sapirus_> Dynamic DNS could be helpful ;)
[19:16] <SnowBro-> hmmm
[19:16] <topper4125> mtx, hmm not really finding anything... everything i find pretty much says the same... restart x
[19:17] <bekks> rckrd: virtual machines.
[19:17] <SnowBro-> in the router i already did the port forwarding
[19:17] <mtx> tried that :( oh well thanks for looking
[19:17] <SnowBro-> but the "NAT-ed" (dont get it)

[19:17] <rckrd> bekks: whats the easiest to setup without a gui?  virtualbox?
[19:18] <bekks> rckrd: Yes.
[19:18] <compdoc> I think virtualbox is all about the gui. qemu-kvm might be better
[19:19] <bekks> compdoc: You are wrong. virtualbox provides "VBoxHeadless" too.
[19:19] <rckrd> yeah bekks, i did see that when i was looking through the doc
[19:19] <compdoc> qemu-kvm is still a good choice
[19:19] <compdoc> can virtualbox even start VMs at boot? Didnt used to
[19:20] <bekks> compdoc: Yes.
[19:20] <rckrd> Should I not do anything on the base ubuntu server itself besides run virtual machines then?
[19:21] <bekks> rckrd: Thats how you'll keep things separated.
[19:21] <compdoc> the base machine can still run samba or other services that dont require speration
[19:21] <compdoc> seperation/isolation
[19:22] <bekks> compdoc: Basically, no services actually require isolation. :)
[19:22] <compdoc> not a bad idea to have a dedicated VM for music, email server, firewall, what have you
[19:23] <compdoc> you can screw up installing a package and its easy to start over

[19:35] <ibolmo> howdy. i've tried to upgrade doing do-release-upgrade from 11.04 to 11.10 (and it was successful) but going from 11.10 to 12.04 I got stuck with libc6 not being able to install since I have an older kernel
[19:35] <ibolmo> 2.6.18, and libc requiring a newer kernel.
[19:36] <ibolmo> i can either upgrade the kernel, or force the install of a libc that will support my kernel.
[19:36] <jrib> ibolmo: did you reboot after the upgrade to 11.10?
[19:36] <ibolmo> yes
[19:36] <ibolmo> let me do a hard reboot to make sure
[19:36] <jrib> ibolmo: can you pastebin the error you are seeing?
[19:36] <ibolmo> sure one sec
[19:38] <jrib> ibolmo: is there a reason you're on a 2.6 kernel?  Seems like 3.0 is what was in ubuntu 11.10
[19:38] <ibolmo> http://pastebin.com/jaf8zWJt
[19:38] <rckrd> i had that error before too.  sadly, it totally escapes me how i figured it out.  It was an easy fix though, that i remember
[19:38] <ibolmo> i'm on a virtual server, and i'm guessing that i'm booting into an old kernel
[19:40] <jrib> ibolmo: hmm, you should probably contact your provider about it
[19:40] <ibolmo> jrib: is there a way to check what other kernels are available? say.. through grub..

[20:16] <Tynach> Help! My Ubuntu installation will not boot. It's a bit of a long story as to what's happened though, but right now I believe either the filesystem or the LVM system is corrupt.
[20:18] <Tynach> I got a new graphics card, and installed it; but it wasn't stable because, I believe, my PSU isn't powerful enough to power everything. I unplugged a few hard drives I didn't currently use and got a 'stable' system back, but it began to act up again. So I tried running FSCK in recovery mode. That froze up, with no hard drive light blinking, so I rebooted. This happened 2 - 3 times. Now Linux won't boot, not even recovery mode.
[20:18] <Tynach> I'm having to use Windows :/
[20:19] <skp1> re-install.
[20:19] <Tynach> The LVM was not encrypted; are you sure there's no way to recover it?
[20:19] <skp1> nop
[20:19] <skp1> ..
[20:19] <Tynach> Nop as in you're not sure, or nop as in there's no way?
[20:19] <bekks> Tynach: Do you get any error messages?
[20:19] <bekks> Tynach: He is not sure.
[20:20] <Tynach> I get dropped to a busybox ash shell, and it says that /dev/mapper/vg-root_lv-root does not exist (paraphrased, I can't exactly copy/paste the error message).
[20:21] <Tynach> Which is why I suspect the LVM being screwy.
[20:21] <Catbuntu> Hi
[20:21] <Catbuntu> One question.
[20:21] <Gnea> One answer.
[20:21] <Catbuntu> I have a sda3 partition with this logical partitions:
[20:21] <bekks> Tynach: Then check wether it exists.
[20:21] <Catbuntu> sda5 (home), sda6 (ubuntu), sda7 (swap), sda9 (xubuntu), sda8 (mint)
[20:22] <Catbuntu> I want to remove sda8 and sda6 and add their space to sda5
[20:22] <Catbuntu> But I think I can't, because there're sda7 and sda9 in the middle
[20:22] <Tynach> bekks, how do I do that from WIndows? As far as I know, there are no LVM aware Linux file browsers on Windows.
[20:22] <Catbuntu> I could append sda6's space to sda5, but not sda8's space, could I?
[20:22] <bekks> Tynach: You'll do it from the busybox or a livecd.
[20:23] <Tynach> bekks, do you know if 12.04 supports LVM with its live CD? I know 11.10 and before did not.
[20:23] <bekks> Catbuntu: You could move partitions and do what you want.
[20:23] <Catbuntu> How?
[20:23] <bekks> Catbuntu: By using gparted, e.g.
[20:23] <Gnea> Catbuntu: sure you could, they're logical
[20:23] <Catbuntu> So I can move the sda9 partition next to sda6?
[20:23] <Catbuntu> Oh, didn't know that
[20:24] <Gnea> well you said they were logical
[20:24] <Catbuntu> Then I'm gonna do that from a LiveDVD
[20:24] <Catbuntu> Yes, I think tey're, let me check
[20:24] <Gnea> sounds like a good idea
[20:24] <Gnea> I suggest gparted

[20:27] <Catbuntu> But how do I move it?
[20:27] <bekks> Catbuntu: By adding free space before or after the partition.
[20:27] <Catbuntu> well, wait
[20:28] <genteor> hey

[20:28] <Gnea> Catbuntu: http://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/
[20:28] <mohawk> so, anyone have any ideas?
[20:29] <Gnea> mohawk: enter the wpa2 password.
[20:29] <Catbuntu> Kook
[20:29] <Catbuntu> Look*
[20:29] <Catbuntu> sda3 is an extended partition.
[20:29] <Catbuntu> Inside of it, there're the partitions mentioned above.
[20:29] <Catbuntu> So that partitions are logical?
[20:29] <mohawk> I did, but the little box keeps telling me to enter it again
[20:29] <FloodBot1> Catbuntu: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[20:29] <bekks> Catbuntu: Yes.
[20:29] <Gnea> Catbuntu: right, and 5-9 are contained within 3
[20:29] <mohawk> I have tried to manually connect and everything, but that little 'password box' pops up every few secons
[20:29] <Gnea> Catbuntu: yes, if a partition is within an extended partition, it is logical
[20:30] <Gnea> Catbuntu: otherwise, it is primary
[20:30] <mohawk> and it tells me to enter my passcode again
[20:30] <Gnea> mohawk: then enter it correctly
[20:30] <mohawk> I did
[20:30] <KeyboardNotFound> Hello all, i love that you talk microphone to listen to the speaker?
[20:30] <Gnea> mohawk: do you have control of your ap?
[20:30] <Catbuntu> So if I want to move sda8 next to sda5, what do I have to do?
[20:30] <mohawk> yes
[20:30] <bekks> Catbuntu: By adding free space before or after the partition.
[20:30] <mohawk> any other network I connect to still gives me internet issues
[20:30] <Gnea> mohawk: so double check the logs on there and also make sure that the mac address isn't blacklisted
[20:30] <Catbuntu> And how can I add it?
[20:31] <Catbuntu> resizing it to less?
[20:31] <bekks> Catbuntu: Did you read the article you have been given?
[20:31] <mohawk> It was on the list yesterday, it just all of a sudden (after a restart) could never connect again
[20:31] <Gnea> Catbuntu: please read the URL that I just gave you. It has a lot of detailed steps, many of which you will need to take.
[20:31] <bekks> Catbuntu: resizing a partition is NOT adding space before or after.
[20:31] <Catbuntu> Oh I didn't see it Gnea.
[20:32] <Gnea> 14:28 < Gnea> Catbuntu: http://www.howtogeek.com/114503/how-to-resize-your-ubuntu-partitions/
[20:32] <Catbuntu> Thanks
[20:32] <Gnea> np
[20:32] <mohawk> I mean, it was working just fine yesterday and then I lost connection after a restart and ould never connect again. It is not the router eith
[20:32] <mohawk> I have kindles, xboxes, macs, pcs, even my dualboot (windows not ubuntu) all hooked up
[20:32] <mohawk> they all work fine except ubuntu
[20:33] <Gnea> mohawk: you'll just have to login to the ap and see what's happening on that end. perhaps you have mac address listing enabled.
[20:33] <mohawk> I have the mac address on that list
[20:33] <Gnea> mohawk: also, what's the make & model of the ap? and what wifi device is on ubuntu?
[20:33] <bekks> mohawk: Check dmesg first to see wether you are missing some firmware or experiencing other errors.
[20:33] <mohawk> ok, because it is only ubuntu causing issues
[20:33] <Catbuntu> I still can't understand.
[20:34] <mohawk> nothing else
[20:34] <Gnea> Catbuntu: can't or won't?
[20:34] <mohawk> I mean I am on windows right now and I get great internet speeds connected to the same router
[20:34] <Gnea> mohawk: are you sure that ubuntu is setup correctly to handle wifi on that computer?
[20:34] <Catbuntu> Look:
[20:35] <mohawk> Should be, it worked yesterday

[20:36] <Catbuntu> But I don't understand this of adding free space.
[20:36] <Gnea> well then you're not going to get very far here.
[20:36] <mohawk> lol
[20:36] <mohawk> I just like to get my problems solved

[20:36] <Gnea> so your problem is an opinion?

[20:36] <Gnea> okay, I digress, back to it..
[20:38] <Catbuntu> This is very odd, I don't understand anything.
[20:38] <Nirvash> What's going on?
[20:38] <Catbuntu> How the hell can I move the partition to the top?
[20:38] <remontees> C'est très pair en effet.
[20:38] <Catbuntu> argg that's frustrating
[20:38] <Nirvash> "to the top"?
[20:38] <Catbuntu> Yes
[20:38] <Catbuntu> After sda6
[20:38] <Nirvash> What does that mean?
[20:39] <Nirvash> I mean... what does it matter what order your partitions are in?"
[20:39] <Gnea> Catbuntu: why don't you just read the website? it's even got screenshots and explains everything in explicit detail...
[20:39] <Catbuntu> I already read that Gnea, I can't understand.
[20:39] <remontees> :D
[20:39] <Gnea> Catbuntu: well I can't help you if you don't make an effort to understand.
[20:40] <Catbuntu> I do Gnea.
[20:40] <skp1> Catbuntu: you're dumb.
[20:40] <Catbuntu> It says nothing about moving.
[20:40] <Catbuntu> If a partition has adjacent unallocated space, you can right-click it and select Resize/Move to enlarge the partition into the unallocated space.
[20:40] <Catbuntu> To specify a new partition size, click and drag the sliders or enter an exact number into the boxes.
[20:40] <Catbuntu> I don't want to change its size.
[20:40] <Catbuntu> I want to MOVE it.
[20:41] <bekks> skp1: Stop insulting people please.
[20:41] <bekks> Catbuntu: resizing a partition is NOT adding space before or after.
[20:41] <Catbuntu> bekks, that's what the website says.
[20:41] <Gnea> Catbuntu: okay, in order to MOVE a partition, you need to have FREE SPACE
[20:41] <bekks> Catbuntu: Add UNALLOCATED space before or after the partition. Before doing so, delete unwanted partitions.
[20:41] <Gnea> Catbuntu: UNALLOCATED space == FREE SPACE
[20:42] <Catbuntu> I know.
[20:42] <Gnea> well then load up the liveDVD and gparted and try messing with it
[20:42] <Catbuntu> So I just delete the sda6 and sda8 partitions.
[20:42] <Gnea> it won't do anything until you click apply so you have plenty of wiggle room to see how it works
[20:42] <bekks> Catbuntu: Create a backup of your system before.
[20:43] <Catbuntu> But there're wanted partitions behind the unallocated space in the bottom and the unallocated space in the top.
[20:43] <bekks> Then MOVE them.
[20:43] <Gnea> Catbuntu: is there anything important on them?
=== Elena is now known as Guest49113
[20:43] <Catbuntu> Nope
[20:44] <Catbuntu> Just the /
[20:44] <bekks> Thats the most important thing.
[20:44] <Catbuntu> /home is at the top so it's safe
[20:44] <Gnea> yes, but you want to add to /home
[20:44] <bekks> Without a backup, nothing is safe.
[20:44] <Gnea> so you have to position /home so it's next to unallocated space
[20:44] <Gnea> also, if /home has anything important, BACK IT UP
[20:44] <Catbuntu> Yep
[20:44] <Catbuntu> Well, there's nothing important there I think
[20:45] <Gnea> you should be sure before continuing at this point.
[20:45] <bekks> Catbuntu: / is the most important thing for a linux system.
[20:45] <Catbuntu> bekks, but reinstalling Xubuntu is just a moment.
[20:46] <Catbuntu> oh, gosh
[20:46] <Catbuntu> I think I'll do that tomorrow
[20:46] <Catbuntu> I'll backup some important things today
[20:46]  * Gnea thinks he just saw a flicker of light appear...
[20:46] <Catbuntu> There's no problem by copying things from an ext4 fs to a ntfs and vice-versa, is there?
[20:47] <bekks> Catbuntu: Wrong.
[20:47] <Gnea> not really, except that you'll lost permissions
[20:47] <Catbuntu> oh gosh
[20:47] <Gnea> so
[20:47] <bekks> Catbuntu: POSIX file permissions cannot be copy onto NTFS.
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
[20:47] <Gnea> create an ISO file, copy the files to the ISO file, then copy the ISO file to the NTFS partition
[20:47] <Gnea> permissions saved, boom
[20:47] <Catbuntu> oh, that's cool
[20:48] <Catbuntu> Can that be done with Xfburner?
=== koen_ is now known as Tweetster
[20:49] <bekks> Catbuntu: Create a tarball.
[20:49] <Catbuntu> ok, let's backup
[20:49] <Catbuntu> And why not an ISO?
[20:49] <bekks> Catbuntu: You can even store that tarball on NTFS.
[20:49] <Gnea> tarball or iso work
[20:50] <Catbuntu> I already started the iso, so...
[20:50] <Gnea> doesn't matter, as long as the files are in a storage medium that preserves the permissions
[20:50] <bekks> No need to burn a DVD nowadays when it is possible to store things instead of burning them.
[20:50] <Catbuntu> Thanks for helping, sorry for being so stupid but I never did any serious partitioning tasks.
[20:50] <Catbuntu> bekks, just an ISO, I can mount it then.
[20:51] <Gnea> That's okay, thanks for putting up with our thinning patience :-)
[20:51] <MonkeyDust> Catbuntu  that's not stupid, that's called 'learning'
[20:51] <bekks> Catbuntu: A tarball, you can untar it.
[20:52] <Gnea> Catbuntu: also with a tarball, you can open it with the archiver and drag & drop files out of it on the desktop once it's back up and running
[20:52] <Catbuntu> Oh let's create a tarball then
[20:53] <arooni-mobile> hi folks i think i have ubuntu 12.04; but i would like to upgrade to 12.10.  when i go updates available; i'm seeing: "Not all updates can be installed run a partial upgrade"  ... what should i do
[20:53] <Gnea> arooni-mobile: open a terminal and type the following: lsb_release -r    what does it say?
[20:53] <Hans-Martin> run the partial upgrade, then probably after a reboot you can update the rest
[20:53] <arooni-mobile> Gnea, Release:	12.04
[20:54] <Gnea> arooni-mobile: what Hans-Martin said
[20:54] <Tex_Nick> Catbuntu : lol ... a tarball is probably the most preferable proceedure for what you're trying to do ;)
[20:54] <Catbuntu> And that's what I'm doing
[20:54] <arooni-mobile> thanks folks

[20:58] <arooni-mobile> yup
[20:58] <Gnea> arooni-mobile: okay, type the following:  sudo apt-get update
[20:59] <arooni-mobile> ok
[20:59] <arooni-mobile> Gnea, another option is to remove the packages that gave an error

[21:02] <joar> each time I upgrade the kernel on my box, the nvidia driver fails.
[21:02] <tin_nqn> Hi everybody
[21:03] <joar> currently I'm in tty1
[21:03] <Noskcaj> hello tin_nqn
[21:03] <bekks> joar: How did you install the nvidia driver then?
[21:03] <joar> bekks: sudo apt-get install nvidia-updates
[21:03] <Gnea> joar: yes, everytime there's a new kernel, the nvidia driver needs to be recompiled. the system should take care of that for you as long as you installed nvidia from the repository and not from nvidia.com.
[21:04] <bekks> Gnea: Which only applies for major kernel updates.
[21:04] <Gnea> bekks: true.
[21:04] <joar> my current kernel is 3.5.16-21 or something
[21:05] <dencrypt> you can see your current kernel with "uname -r"
[21:05] <jagginess> joar, probably you mean 3.5.0-21
[21:05] <bekks> joar: Check it with uname -a
[21:05] <Gnea> joar: how did you install the nvidia driver the first time? via commandline or via the gui?
[21:05] <tin_nqn> People, I need to grab deb packages for online installation on a Quantal (12.10) amd64 . I'm in a machine with ubuntu 11.10 i386
[21:05] <joar> jagginess: 3.5.0-21, yes
[21:05] <tin_nqn> is it possible?
[21:05] <joar> bekks: ^
[21:05] <bekks> Gnea: Doesnt matter actually. You can use both approaches to install the driver from the repos.
[21:06] <joar> Gnea: I think I've done both on this machine.
[21:06] <joar> Just today, I checked aptitude show and the package nvidia-updates was marked as installed
[21:06] <Gnea> bekks: true, but one might be more thorough than the other, depending on what steps were taken at the cli
[21:06] <tin_nqn> I'll try apt-get with -d option (dowload only) changing my source.list to quantal release
[21:06] <tin_nqn> sudo apt-get install --download-only -a amd64 -o=dir::cache=. --target-release 12.10
[21:06] <bekks> Gnea: "sudo apt-get install nvidia-updates". :)
[21:07] <Gnea> joar: I don't see an nvidia-updates package installed on my system (I have ndivia too)
[21:07] <joar> Gnea: sorry, nvidia-current-updates
[21:07] <joar> it's the slightly more upstream nvidia driver
[21:07] <MicW> hi
[21:07] <Gnea> I have a nvidia-current-updates and a nvidia-settings-updates
[21:08] <MicW> when i install using ebootstrap, how do i select a certain ubuntu release (especially "lubuntu")?
[21:08] <Gnea> joar: okay, well the ones that matter the most will be the glx and kernel packages.  dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep nvidia   should show you which ones are actually installed
[21:08] <bekks> MicW: Lubuntu is just Ubuntu with LXDE.
[21:08] <joar> When I installed the nvidia-current-updates package however, it told me it would not build the kernel module since the kernel sources were not installed.
[21:09] <Gnea> okay
[21:09] <bekks> joar: Then install the kernel sources.
[21:09] <MicW> i see. so if i only install xorg without any other stuff i'd get a minimal x, right?
[21:09] <joar> bekks: I think I tried.
[21:09] <MicW> i want to create a netboot xmbc client
[21:09] <Gnea> joar: do you have pastebinit installed
[21:09] <jhutchins_wk> tin_nqn: Mixing releases is a great way to get to do a clean reinstall!
[21:10] <joar> I installed linux-headers-3.5.0-21 and then removed (--purge) and installed the nvidia-current-updates package, it said the same thing though.
[21:10] <tin_nqn> jhutchins_wk: I don't want to install anything on this "connected" machine
[21:10] <joar> I guess I have the wrong "kernel source"
[21:10] <joar> as I just installed the headers
[21:10] <joar> IIRC header install, nvidia removal, nvidia install has been the trick the times before.
[21:10] <bekks> joar: Because the headers arent the sources.
[21:10] <tin_nqn> just to download packages for the another, where I'll have very restricted connectivity
[21:10] <jhutchins_wk> tin_nqn: So you're trying to download components for an off-line system?
[21:10] <Gnea> joar: sudo apt-get install pastebinit && dpkg -l | grep ^ii | grep nvidia | pastebinit    <-- should give u a URL, please paste it here
[21:11] <tin_nqn> jhutchins_wk: true.

[21:12] <bekks> joar: And the URL?
[21:12] <Gnea> joar: it didn't give a whole url?
[21:12] <bekks> Gnea: It did :)
[21:12] <joar> Gnea: I'm in the console :)
[21:12] <Gnea> joar: so why don't you have gpm installed? :)

[21:15] <joar> Gnea: I can't find that package.
[21:15] <bencahill> bekks: So this is completely impossible?
[21:15] <bekks> bencahill: 8.04 isnt supported anymore.
[21:15] <joar> Gnea: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1486161/ (should be a list of packages)
[21:15] <Gnea> joar: then apt-cache search nvidia kernel source
[21:16] <Hans-Martin> bencahill: if updating is not an option compile from source
[21:16] <joar> Gnea: the paste is an aptitude search nvidia
[21:16] <Hans-Martin> bencahill: but updating from 8.04 should not be an option, it should be mandatory :-)
[21:16] <Gnea> joar: okay, please perform the command I requested.
[21:16] <bencahill> Hans-Martin: I read this and thought it might be possible: http://serverfault.com/a/227035
[21:16] <joar> Gnea: returns null
[21:17] <Gnea> joar: what version of ubuntu do u have?
[21:17] <hausmann> i have a laptop, what is wrong if i can see my wifi in windows but not in ubuntu? this happened when i restarted my router a few days ago, cannot see it in ubuntu at all even if i leave the computer on for hours
[21:17] <joar> Gnea: sorry, it didn't. with the keywords in quotes, it did.
[21:17] <nanonyme> Hey, any hopes of getting Grub2 2.00 from quantal to precise-backports?
[21:17] <bencahill> Hans-Martin: Sure. I've got five more days at home, it's my brother's server, and I just want to finish some stuff up. (I discovered that the anonymous function I used in a Yii app I developed on my laptop needed php 5.3, installed is 5.2.4). Life happens. :-(
[21:17] <Gnea> joar: okay, and can you pastebinit that list please?
[21:17] <joar> Gnea: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1486169/
[21:18] <Hans-Martin> bencahill: ok, sounds like it should work. much easier than compiling...
[21:18] <Gnea> joar: lsb_release -r  <-- result?
[21:18] <joar> Gnea: 12.10
[21:18] <joar> gpm works like a charm, thanks for the tip Gnea :)
[21:18]  * Gnea is now thankful that I have not upgraded to 12.10 yet
[21:18] <Hans-Martin> bencahill: but you should be certain that there's nothing which would be incompatible with a newer php version. been bitten by this once...
[21:19] <markovh> do deb files come with apt sources?
[21:19] <jagginess> markovh, no
[21:19] <jagginess> markovh, .deb files are in apt repositories..
[21:19] <joar> I'll try removing (--purge) nvidia-*
[21:19] <markovh> sure? i'm seeing some sources in my /etc/apt/sources.d after i added a chrome deb
[21:20] <jagginess> markovh, in side .deb files are "dependency" definitions..  apt-get resolves these definitions
[21:20] <Gnea> joar: that probably won't help. which nvidia card do you have?  lspci | grep VGA
[21:20] <joar> Gnea: GTX 560 Ti
[21:20] <jagginess> markovh, apt-cache policy chrome<enter>
[21:21] <markovh> can they depend on packages that require additional sources then? it would make sense as i'm sure google want to keep chrome updated. if it didn't sure the chrome binary is installed non world writeable right?
[21:21] <joar> Gnea: VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GF114 [GeForce GTX 560 Ti] (rev a1)
[21:21] <jagginess> markovh, you'll see it's not from the official debian repository.. real debian packages do not do that
[21:22] <markovh> jagginess: so yes they do then?
[21:22] <Gnea> ^.o
[21:22] <Gnea> joar: okay, that should be covered under the 270 driver, which is 185, which is what I use
[21:23] <anonymous_> happy new year from everyone at galliumgroup.net
[21:23] <jagginess> markovh, apt-cache policy google-chrome-stable <enter> would show 500 http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable/main amd64 Packages

[21:29] <joar> Gnea: as in GNOME 3?
[21:29] <Gnea> joar: yeah
[21:29] <joar> got that covered :)
[21:29] <Gnea> cool
[21:30] <Apachez> iceroot: gooling on ít gives that alignment will bring you higher performence and lower read/write operations for every block you which to read/write
[21:31] <nima_samieinia> apachez : i dont think so had a problem in installation maybe efi portion of new generation bios build a problem of handle the encrypted partitions
[21:32] <angs> what is the command to search a directory or a file on terminal?

[21:32] <Gnea> angs: well find for the directory and grep for a file
[21:32] <iceroot> Apachez: sorry wrong nick
[21:32] <Gnea> joar: cheers! :D
[21:32] <angs> thank you
[21:33] <iceroot> Apachez: the installer will use the normal ext4 options, you can change them by yourself but it the installer will not make a difference for SSD, USB-Flash, HDD (SATA, SCSI,IDE), SD-Card and so on
[21:33] <Gnea> find . -exec grep something {} \;
[21:34] <Apachez> I was thinking of the alignment stuff described in http://forums.fedoraforum.org/showthread.php?t=256068 (among other places)
[21:34] <Apachez> the ext4 options are easy, just add discard,noatime,noadirtime  to the mount flags
[21:35] <iceroot> angs: you dont need grep. find directory -iname *.txt
[21:35] <angs> thank you iceroot
[21:35] <Gnea> iceroot: you need grep to search *within* files.
[21:36] <iceroot> Gnea: and where did he ask for file-content?
[21:36] <iceroot> Gnea: he asked for filenames
[21:36] <Gnea> 15:32 < angs> what is the command to search a directory or a file on terminal?
[21:36] <Gnea> "or a file"
[21:36] <iceroot> Gnea: and to search files containing the string "foo" i dont need find, i just need grep
[21:37] <Gnea> iceroot: precisely.
[21:38] <iceroot> Gnea: and he asked to search for a specific directoryname or filename, so there is no reason to use grep, just find
[21:38] <remontees> Ça en chie du ventilo !
[21:38] <MonkeyDust> there's aso locate

[21:38] <MarchHare> Hello. Can anyone help me determine what's going on once and for all? I am trying to install 12.10 on a machine with an Nvidia 8500gt (an older model), and for the past several versions 11.10 and up, nothing seems to work "out of the box" like it's supposed to
[21:39] <Gnea> iceroot: please be sure to double-check how he asked the question. he did use the word 'or'. Therefore, he could have just asked: what is the command to search a file on terminal?   Think about that.
[21:39] <Gnea> angs: is that what you meant?
[21:39] <iceroot> Gnea: as always, the questions here a bad and not detailed :)
[21:40] <iceroot> MarchHare: and what is your question?
[21:40] <Gnea> iceroot: yes, there is a certain level of assumption that's taken. as long as the user was able to accomplish what they wanted to do, that's what's important. :)
[21:40] <iceroot> Gnea: yes :)
[21:41] <MarchHare> iceroot: Well, I can't figure out why the proprietary nvidia drivers won't work correctly. They used to.
[21:41] <iceroot> MarchHare: and "wont work correctly" means what exactly?
[21:42] <MarchHare> iceroot: Incorrect resolutions (not making the proper one available, either), screen scrolls slowly, nvidia utilities don't work correctly and throw exceptions, etc
[21:43] <jhutchins_wk> MarchHare: Does it autodetect or does it use an xorg.conf?
[21:43] <sw_> hi! our /var/log/auth.log is empty on a couple of our servers, has this moved somewhere else?
[21:43] <MarchHare> iceroot: I'd try to give you a better description of what's going on, but I have no clue what's breaking.
[21:44] <MarchHare> iceroot: Well, I think it's autodetecting and not using the xorg.conf
[21:44] <Rajvi> Hi, all
[21:44] <jhutchins_wk> MarchHare: See what you can find in /var/log/Xorg.0.log - sounds to me like the drivers from Nvidia are buggy.
[21:45] <MarchHare> iceroot: It likes to detect my screen at 1920x1080, but that has the scrolling issue. I used to keep it at 1680x1050 to deal with the scroll
[21:45] <jrib> sw_: still working here.  But check the setup in /etc/rsyslog*
[21:46] <jhutchins_wk> MarchHare: I have an intel board that does 1440xwhatever, but it has so much noise and artifacts I scale it back with xrandr.

[21:46] <sw_> jrib: all of our installs (should) be exactly the same, and it's working on 90%, but on some of our servers it's empty. I'll take a look, is there a file in particular I should check, or all of the rsyslog* ones?

[21:46] <Rajvi> Got a simple question : Everything fine on my laptop, however when I got to - " About this computer" it shows - Unknow for the graphics  display. Everything fine I am just curious.
[21:47] <jhutchins_wk> sw_: You'll probably want to make sure that more than one user has logged in to the system.
[21:47] <MarchHare> iceroot: There are a few lines towards the end "CRT-0:nvidia-auto-select"
[21:47] <nima_samieinia> i want point of programming for access direct to ext file system anyone exist for communication
[21:48] <MarchHare> iceroot: I did use nvidia-xconfig at one point, though
[21:48] <morfeo_81> hi there
[21:48] <sw_> jhutchins_wk: that could be a problem on some of the servers. but, if I remember correctly that file logs failed logins too?
[21:49] <mustafa> Hi! I would like to install ArgoUML for Linux Xubuntu 12. What commands do I need?
[21:49] <morfeo_81> How can change this? Every time I insert a usb mount the element in this folder /media/morfeo/ and not /media/
[21:49] <morfeo_81> happy new year!!!
[21:50] <jhutchins_wk> sw_: Somewhat dependent on the configuration, but I think it does so by default.
[21:50] <jhutchins_wk> morfeo_81: That is so that you can access it.
[21:51] <jhutchins_wk> morfeo_81: Allows use of the system by more than one user, as in ltsp.
[21:51] <morfeo_81> <jhutchins_wk: ah ok
[21:51] <morfeo_81> <jhutchins_wk: ah ok thanks
[21:52] <mustafa> does somebody knows about ArgoUML?
[21:52] <mustafa> It's a tool for Software design
[21:52] <mustafa> for Software Engineering
[21:52] <Tex_Nick> MarchHare : i don't know if this will help, but you might have a look ... http://tech.sixcolumns.com/2012/11/nvidia-310-19-drivers-released-how-to-install-it-in-ubuntu-12-1012-04/
[21:53] <morfeo_81> Another question.. I want to mount a partition every time after boot automaticaly I change fstab like that /dev/sda5  /media/Data/  ext4 defaults 0 0 but my link at the folder do not work
[21:53] <maujhsn209> I just created a new liveCD! I have administrator privilages amd a password! Why do I get permission denied when trying to open "path/foldername/" in the nautilus  file manager?
[21:54] <jhutchins_wk> morfeo_81: Does /media/Data exist?  Does it mount if you issue the command manually?
[21:54] <mustafa> If somebody knows about ArgoUML, please contact me!!
[21:54] <nima_samieinia> mustafa : this is not compiled for ubuntu
[21:54] <dufa> maujhsn209: nautilus does not run as the superuser by default

[21:55] <maujhsn209> dufa Okay so what do I have to type out on the command line?
[21:55] <mustafa> nima_samieinia : what do you mean?
[21:56] <dufa> maujhsn209: first, are you actually trying to get to a file that requires super user privledges?

[22:09] <William9455> Hi Blag
[22:09] <guntbert> Blag: Do you have an ubuntu support question?
[22:10] <Blag> Is there a way to use Netflix in Ubuntu or lubuntu?
[22:10] <DJones> !netflix | Blag
[22:10] <ubottu> Blag: If you use Netflix, there is an unofficial solution for using it in Ubuntu detailed in http://www.compholio.com/netflix-desktop/ - bug reports in https://bugs.launchpad.net/netflix-desktop
[22:11] <Blag> guntbert: does this work in lubuntu?
[22:11] <kostkon> Blag, yes
[22:12] <Blag> Ok. Thank you.
[22:12] <rand> I have 12.04LTS installed, I don't like the desktop that comes with it, what do I install to get a regular gnome desktop? Thansk.
[22:13] <guntbert> !nounity | rand
[22:13] <ubottu> rand: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[22:14] <rand> Thanks guntbert
[22:15] <nima_samieinia> ubottu : good stuf showed by you

[22:19] <nosferato> its the built in laptop touchpad
[22:19] <tieinv> nima_samieinia, i perfer you ask me questions in the ubuntu main window
[22:20] <Noskcaj> does anyone know what the countdown on the ubuntu website is about?
[22:21] <Apachez> Noskcaj: mayan calendar take 2? ;)
[22:21] <Apachez> err second attempt
[22:21] <nima_samieinia> i want know about kernel and ext handle mechansim for programming to access to them
[22:21] <Noskcaj> Apachez, on ubuntu.com there is a countdown ending later today
[22:22] <jhutchins_wk> nima_samieinia: http://kernel.org
[22:22] <Tex_Nick> nosferato : you may have inadvertantly activated an accessibility feature with some keystrokes ... try hitting your ESC key
[22:22] <issa> hi from spain
[22:23] <nima_samieinia> better refrence module with doc
[22:23] <nima_samieinia> not a kernel document
[22:23] <compdoc> we really dodged a bullet on the Myan thing - you shouldn't kid around
[22:23] <Noskcaj> i think its a touch support update
[22:24] <ryancb06> is it possible in ubuntu 12.04 to move the unity bar to the bottom?
[22:25] <nosferato> Hi my wierd mouse freeze got fixed when I logged out and logged in. can anyone help me to prevent it in the future?
[22:25] <Tex_Nick> nosferato : you may have inadvertantly activated an accessibility feature with some keystrokes ... try hitting your ESC key
[22:25] <jrib> sw_: /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf is the one that mentions /var/log/auth.log here
[22:25] <nosferato> oh I see, thanks Tex_Nick , I ll try that next time when it freezes again
[22:26] <HAPPYnewYR2013> anybody ever have any luck getting bridged networking in win 7 virtualbox using 12.04 for the VM
[22:26] <nima_samieinia> nosferato : your bios have a usb support from 2 functionality one os support two bios support check the bios mode
[22:26] <jrib> sw_: note this is an upgrade so the configuration may have changed (or not :))
[22:26] <nima_samieinia> disable the synaptic pad in bios
[22:26] <Tex_Nick> nosferato : i've done that myself ... hope it helps
[22:26] <nima_samieinia> conflict of two mouse
[22:27] <HAPPYnewYR2013> so
[22:27] <jrib> sw_: and of course you should make sure that rsyslogd is actually running
[22:30] <nima_samieinia> any one recommend syslog server for modem log space

=== JPMH is now known as YouDreamOfJeanie
[22:37] <pablum> ok, i'm new to ubuntu.  but i used debian for many years...
=== akke_ is now known as akke
[22:38] <pablum> i don't like the constraints of the gui...
[22:38] <pablum> but my preferences, i think, don't play well with it.
[22:38] <YouDreamOfJeanie> pablum: so, why did you change?
[22:38] <pablum> because it's on the laptop i'm now using.
[22:39] <topper4125> Changing the DE is very easy to do... which one are you interested in?
[22:39] <YouDreamOfJeanie> you do not have to use the gui you kmow
[22:39] <pablum> basically, i have always used focus follows mouse + lazy focus, and used shortcuts to move from window to window
[22:40] <YouDreamOfJeanie> I use shortcuts to move from window to window all the time - why can you not do that?
[22:40] <pablum> metashitty was pretty good for that...
[22:40] <pablum> i do, but...
[22:40] <YouDreamOfJeanie> you don't have to use unity you know
[22:40] <pablum> for example, how do you use a window that isn't at the top of the stack?
[22:40] <pablum> okay, that's good
[22:41] <k1l_> !notunity | pablum
[22:41] <ubottu> pablum: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[22:41] <YouDreamOfJeanie> I actually have assigned ctrl-1..ctrl-4 for my first four windows
[22:42] <pablum> k, thanks for the lead
[22:42] <topper4125> you can also change the way focus works in unity: http://askubuntu.com/questions/64605/how-do-i-set-focus-follows-mouse
[22:42] <pablum> ooh, before i jump, maybe i'll try that.
[22:42] <YouDreamOfJeanie> k1l_: how do you know what issues are covered in things like notunity that you just did
[22:43] <topper4125> pablum: keep in mind that was just a quick search... I haven't used unity any longer than it took to switch desktops to XFCE.
[22:44] <Tex_Nick> YouDreamOfJeanie : if i understand your question ... http://ubottu.com/factoids.cgi
[22:45] <k1l_> YouDreamOfJeanie: if i got your question right: look at what Tex_Nick said and just seen that command here in the channel
[22:45] <pablum> well, i feel like i learned a lot.  thanks
[22:46] <YouDreamOfJeanie> k1l_: I do not see "notunity" there for example - so I do not think that is what I am asking
[22:47] <k1l_> YouDreamOfJeanie: try the search on that site.
[22:47] <topper4125> pablum: yer welcome. happy new year
[22:48] <Tex_Nick> YouDreamOfJeanie : top of page ... type "notunity" in search box
[22:48] <YouDreamOfJeanie> pablum: the one thing I would say is - persevere with unity for a little - it is different and so strange but you may get to like it - I did
[22:48] <Apachez> my google-fu is failing me... where can I find a manual entry regarding the "typical usage" option during partitioning when you install ubuntu?   http://workaround.org/sites/default/files/ispmail-lenny-install-partitioning3.png
[22:49] <YouDreamOfJeanie> Tex_Nick: ty - yep - I C it now - so how do you guys remember all that is there - this is so much?

[23:19] <chaospsychex> 1024x780 is the highest i can select
[23:19] <chaospsychex> when it should be 1280x1024

[23:21] <chaospsychex> topper4125: lol, ok then let me rephrase the question...
[23:21] <chaospsychex> could someone tell me why my monitor's EDID is being incorrectly read ?
[23:22] <chaospsychex> topper4125: xrandr -q doesn't even show the resolution i want to use
[23:22] <topper4125> Part 5 of that link might cover that
[23:22] <machinarius> hey guys, anyone here has experience with NodeJS and a LAN? I've setup a small node webserver and i can *only* access it using localhost, whilst a rials server obund on that same port will work with no issues

[23:23] <topper4125> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution#Adding_undetected_resolutions
[23:23] <jhutchins_wk> chaospsychex: Perhaps the driver for your chipset doesnt have the right modes.
[23:23] <chaospsychex> jhutchins_wk: how would i find that out ?
[23:26] <topper4125> chaospsychex: which video card are you using?
[23:27] <topper4125> chaospsychex: and monitor?
[23:27] <jhutchins_wk> chaospsychex: First I would read and try that page from the wiki.  Then you can use lspci to determine your video chipset, and look at /var/log/Xorg.0.org for errors and information.

[23:30] <sront> heyho, im running ubuntu 12.10 and my system doesnt give me the choice to install prorietary drivers. running a laptop with onboard geforce graphics and an intel i5 if that might have something to do with it. can somebody help me figure out why/how to fix that?
[23:30] <chaospsychex> topper4125: i managed to get 1280x1024 set and displayed but will I have to do this on every reboot? Are these changes persistent ?
[23:31] <sront> the graphics "card" is a nvidia geforce gt 325M CUDA
[23:31] <chaospsychex> does 12.04 have synaptic by default ?
[23:31] <daftykins> sront: sounds like an optimus laptop?
[23:32] <sront> msi fx-600
[23:32] <topper4125> chaospsychex: Part 6 of that link explains how to make it permanent
[23:32] <daftykins> sront: optimus is the nvidia technology where the laptop uses the intel embedded graphics, but can make use of the nvidia chip if you choose to. that doesn't work under Linux properly
[23:33] <sront> ah
[23:33] <sront> i see
[23:33] <sront> can i like, disable the intel graphics and force it to use the nvidia graphics?
[23:33] <Brunbook> because when I put the windows docky is small?
[23:35] <k1l_> sront: you can look in your bios for an option like that
[23:36] <daftykins> sront: i think installing the nvidia driver *might* force the nvidia one to be used all the time. i'm not sure. it might be worth you googling your laptop and linux to see what it does
[23:36] <daftykins> k1l_: doesn't work like that unfortunately
[23:36] <sront> ok, ty
[23:36] <vjoe> hey guys
[23:36] <sront> first bios, then googling laptop
[23:36] <vjoe> is the software center in sync with apt-get?
[23:37] <k1l_> daftykins: if you dont have a setting in the bios you cant force it driverwise, iirc
[23:39] <MonkeyDust> vjoe  software center is a front end for apt get
[23:39] <vjoe> oh
[23:39] <vjoe> like synaptic
[23:39] <vjoe> ok
