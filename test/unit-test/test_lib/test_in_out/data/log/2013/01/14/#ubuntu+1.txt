[07:54] <rigo> hi
[07:54] <rigo> my wlan card is not always detected. as my tvcard.
[07:55] <rigo> right now is the "default" 12.10 kernel installed. however im not sure that the issue is permanent under raring. i have to test.
[07:57] <rigo> x64
[08:04] <rigo> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12454306#post12454306
[08:15] <Walther> On apt-get update && apt-get upgrade, i get the following:
[08:15] <Walther> The following packages have unmet dependencies: cups : Depends: cups-daemon (>= 1.6.1-1) but 1.6.1-0ubuntu15 is installed cups-daemon : Depends: libcups2 (= 1.6.1-0ubuntu15) but 1.6.1-1 is installed
[08:15] <Walther> E: Unmet dependencies. Try using -f.
[08:26] <rigo> bazhang: maybe its easyer here
[08:26] <bazhang> rigo, you on 12.10? or 13.04 with the issue
[08:27] <rigo> is there a 13.04? never heared.
[08:27] <rigo> so im on 12.10 x64 with raring
[08:28] <rigo> right now its a clean install of the minimal system server installation 12.10 x64 with openssh server only.
[08:28] <Walther> eh, 13.04 is raring
[08:28] <Walther> 12.10 is quantal
[08:29] <rigo> i c.
[08:29] <rigo> yesterday i upgraded to the latest stable raring kernel. and im not sure that i had the error... i have to test.
[08:30] <rigo> what is sure, if there is no network, i have nothing under dmesg, lspci and ifconfig -a
[08:34] <bazhang> rigo, you mixed a raring kernel with 12.10?
[08:34] <rigo> of corse :D
[08:34] <rigo> bad?
[08:34] <bazhang> rigo, thats completely unsupported; why are you asking for support on it?
[08:35] <rigo> ok. right now i have a clean install of 12.10 x64 with the default kernel.

[13:23] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[13:23] <MrChrisDruif> Hey BluesKaj
[13:23] <BluesKaj> Hi MrChrisDruif
[13:24] <MrChrisDruif> So how is the Ubuntu train coming along?
[13:25] <BluesKaj> I'm still on 12.10 , the 3.7 kernel bugs prevent my pc from having 13.04 installed
[13:26] <MrChrisDruif> Ugh.
[13:27] <MrChrisDruif> "3.7.1-2.fc18.x86_64" <= me running Fedora 18
[13:29] <BluesKaj> no big deal, I'm trying out opensuse 12.2 just for fun ...seems ok but the packaging system is rather convoluted with yast and zypper and the rpms ..I find the source repos a bit messy
[13:29] <BluesKaj> but it runs well enough

[15:28] <rye> has anybody noticed increased number of media playback hanging with totem/gstreamer in raring?
=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[16:17] <BluesKaj> totem , rye ? ..wow thought that was old and dead
[16:19] <rye> BluesKaj: totem, yep, as in default video player in Ubuntu. I guess this is what happening in raring - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+bug/1085342
[16:19] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1085342 in totem (Ubuntu) "Totem window constantly becomes unresponsive with gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio installed" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[16:20] <BluesKaj> default, really ? ...been on KDE for yrs so totem has sort of drifted away ...I use VLC anyway
[17:06] <progallo> Hi im totally new on Ubuntu can somebody help me?
[17:06] <progallo> im having troubles with my mouse
[17:06] <progallo> its a wireless logitech
[17:40] <bjsnider> progallo, better to use the #ubuntu channel
[18:09] <jarlath> Anyone using Raring for day-to-day use? I'm happy with 12.04 but also I'm hearing that Raring has been very reliable due to the new QA processes. Just curious :)
[18:11] <dkessel> not on my primary machine. i use it on my netbooks, but it is very stable compared to previous releases, yes...
[18:13] <jtaylor> it probably depends on what software you are using
[18:13] <jtaylor> and with what you have problems in 12.04
[18:14] <BluesKaj> raring won't install here , the kernel(3.7) is buggy nfor some amd cpus and nvidia gpus
[18:18] <jarlath> thanks dkessel , jtaylor and BluesKaj . I have no problems with 12.04 and I have it installed on several machines so I will be reluctant to upgrade before the next LTS. But there were some very nice updates to Unity since then so I'm finding it difficult not to upgrade :)
[18:19] <dkessel> BluesKaj, raring does have the 3.8 kernel now
[18:19] <BluesKaj> jarlath, that's main thing , if you're happy with your setup then stay with it
[18:20] <BluesKaj> dkessel, yeah just tried the latest daily , same result ,..stalls in text mode at the HW recognition stage
[18:21] <jtaylor> if you have a free partition you can install it there to test it out
[18:21] <BluesKaj> which is about 10 secs into the install procedure on the live-dvd
[20:14] <BluesKaj> ok , I'm at the 13.04 destop on the live dvd , and have decent graphics from nouveau. However , the installer / ubiquity still will not install the OS. It just sits there with the cursor spinning . I assume this is the new 3.8 kernel since this is today's daily build.
[20:15] <DredTiger> I'm running raring on a macbookpro. When I connect to my company VPN, DNS resolution for things outside the company domain fails.
[20:15] <bjsnider> BluesKaj, getting closer though
[20:15] <DredTiger>  I've been poking around the internet and see how network-manager uses dnsmasq
[20:16] <DredTiger>  however /var/run/NetworkManager/dnsmasq.conf is always zero bytes
[20:17] <DredTiger> /etc/resolv.conf only has 127.0.1.1 for lookups...I assume that's what dnsmasq binds to
[20:18] <DredTiger> I've tried adding extra dns servers via network manager to the vpn configuration settings, my wireless settings and no joy
[20:18] <BluesKaj> bjsnider:  tyes, but it's odd that ubiquity is still stalling. Granted that it's early days , but this has been going on since november
[20:19] <BluesKaj> DredTiger:  are you on wifi or ethernet , or both ?
[20:20] <bjsnider> not sure this is the right channel for his questions
[20:20] <DredTiger> BluesKaj: Wifi
[20:20] <DredTiger> I can plug in if needed
[20:20] <BluesKaj> ok then you need network manager
[20:21] <BluesKaj> ime , NM doesn't play nice with dnsmasq
[20:22] <DredTiger> I thought NM runs it's own copy of dnsmasq? I certainly didn't set up dnsmasq
[20:22] <DredTiger> Is there a pastebin for this channel?
[20:27] <DredTiger> I used the general ubuntu pastebin
[20:27] <DredTiger> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1532124/
[20:28] <BluesKaj> penguin42 said something about setting grub to text mode in the console so that ubquity wouuldn't try to use the graphical mode during the install on the assumption that it's the graphics card bug that's preventing ubiquity from going further

[21:25] <DredTiger> Is this the place for me to be asking about VPN & DNS behavior in raring? Or is there just no one here right now who is familiar w/ those subsystems?
=== jack_^ is now known as wN
[21:51] <bjsnider> DredTiger, unlikely that this is the right place
[21:53] <bjsnider> there is a channel for network-manager talk. it's #nm
[21:53] <bjsnider> this may not be a raring-specific issue
[21:53] <DredTiger> bjsnider: thnx
[21:54] <bjsnider> even if it is, the talk that goes on in this channel is usually on a lower technical level than that

[22:04] <schmoost1r> Hi there... I've an issue which manifests similarly to #869881, though I'm up and running with 13.04 & unlike the original reporter I seem to have traced back to a missing or mal-specified /dev/xconsole
[22:05] <schmoost1r> I'm not sure wether to comment on that bug, or if I should open another
[22:05] <schmoost1r> I'd rather not be needlessly opening bug reports
[22:14] <schmoost1r> ah, I think the rsyslog package just needs its deps updating
=== dniMretsaM is now known as dniMretsaM_away
[22:29] <schmoost1r> ah, no, it's "Could not open output pipe '/dev/xconsole'" on start
