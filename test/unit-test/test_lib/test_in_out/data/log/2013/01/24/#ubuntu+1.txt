[04:31] <gnomefreak> finally all packages can be updated :)
[04:31] <gnomefreak> anyone know if kde or xfce are able to use screensavers?
[04:47] <micahg> gnomefreak: xfce uses xscreensaver
[04:49] <gnomefreak> micahg: they still work?
[04:49] <micahg> idk, haven't tried
[04:49] <micahg> if not, please file a bug
[04:49] <gnomefreak> gnome doesnt support screensavers anymore not since 12.10
[05:04] <bjsnider> highly questionable whether they're stil necessary
[05:12] <gnomefreak> bjsnider: i like them and miss them, but since gnome doesnt support them anymore AFAICT there isnt much we can do, but gnome seems to be steadly dropping items since Untiy was introduced
[05:13] <bjsnider> yeah but, turning off the monitor is obviously better than running it with a screensaver
[05:14] <bjsnider> if screensavers had never existed, at this point in time, would it be necessary to invent them?
[05:14] <gnomefreak> bjsnider: yeah it is
[05:14] <gnomefreak> no
[05:14] <bjsnider> so you can see their point
[05:15] <gnomefreak> yeah i can to an extent
[05:36] <amoma> gnome terminal wants to install a font. How disable it?
[05:37] <micahg> !crosspost | amoma
[05:37] <ubottu> amoma: Please don't ask the same question in multiple Ubuntu channels at the same time. Many helpers are in more than one channel and it's not fair to them or the other people seeking support.
[05:39] <amoma> ok, but tel me how to turn it off
[05:40] <amoma> just point me where to look
[05:41] <micahg> it's in the dependency chain somewhere, even --no-install-recommends asks for it
[05:41] <amoma> i searched web but :(
[05:41] <amoma> i chceserchad etc for strings but :(
[05:42] <amoma> i do not install any fonts for browsking binaries
[05:42] <micahg> amoma: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1565182/
[05:45] <amoma> this do not help, i do not need a font i want to turn this popup off
[05:45] <micahg> that tells you which package needs it
[05:46] <micahg> how do you expect to have a terminal without a font?
[05:46] <amoma> no this is false messsage, i loking at binary content of files
[05:46] <micahg> *GUI terminal
[05:46] <amoma> in gui in terminal window
[05:48] <amoma> the binary content of file i inspecting is recognized by random chance
[05:48] <amoma> as jabenese , telug, kanda, kilons adromeda_GAI and os on
[05:49] <amoma> *and so on, random
[05:50] <amoma> not related to any font
[05:51] <amoma> now wants to install Thai
[05:51] <amoma> and if i closed it popup Hindi
[05:52] <amoma> scrooling 3 screen down ask for Cherokee
[05:52] <micahg> oh, I thought you meant on package install, I have no idea why it would pop up requests like that
[05:53] <amoma> the request popup since the binary content looks like unicode
[05:54] <amoma> this seem obvius to me, i asking only where is config for this behavior
[05:54] <amoma> or should i uninstall gnome
[05:54] <micahg> it's the middle of the night for most people, so I'd suggest being patient
[05:55] <amoma> this is not helpful, next time say nothing please
[05:56] <amoma> this my discourage me from seeking help on ubuntu
[05:56] <micahg> amoma: I misunderstood your issue, it was one I thought I could help with
[06:05] <amoma> ok i understand this "micahg> !crosspost | amoma" was by misunderstanding
[06:05] <micahg> no, that was for crossposting, regardless of whether or not I had an answer
[06:08] <amoma> for you "micahg> it's the middle of the night" but on the other chanels in diffrent languages is not. earth is round here night somewhere else day
[06:09] <micahg> most of the people in these channels are in the americas or europe, which gives you from ~9PM to 8AM
[06:11] <amoma> micahg, thank you
[06:12] <micahg> I was only suggesting patience as someone might come along soon and answer your question

[20:55] <alo21> Hi... every time I try to install ubuntu 13.04 on my usb-stick, usb-creator-gtk crashes.
[21:17] <ironhalik> Hello
[21:18] <ironhalik> was wondering how usabe raring is at the current stage
[21:18] <ironhalik> I used to install later alphas and betas of previous releases and usually managed with the bugs
[21:36] <BluesKaj> ironhalik, depends on your hardware with thios release more than previous one in my experience , if you run AMD64 cpu and nvidia graphics you might want to consider upgrading via the internet from 12.10 if that's what you're running .
=== c_smith is now known as c_smith_afk
[21:38] <BluesKaj> ubiquity installer has a bug that stalls the install at hardware recognition on some AMD64 pcs
[21:40] <ironhalik> I'm planning to install it on a x220 thinkpad
[21:40] <ironhalik> x64 mobile sandy bridge with integrated graphics
[21:40] <ironhalik> I'm kinda wondering if 13.04 is more buggy then 12.10 ;>
[21:41] <ironhalik> with 12.10, I get service crash every minute or two, on 12.04, I can't get the trackpad to work properly
[21:41] <ironhalik> so I thought about 13.04 :>
[21:42] <BluesKaj> looks to me like you could install 13.04 without too much trouble, ironhalik
[21:43] <ironhalik> I probably should make an emergency 12.xx install drive, just in case the instaler fails at a critical moment ;>
[21:43] <ironhalik> anyways, thanks for the info BluesKaj
[21:44] <BluesKaj> intel seems to be troeble free with 13.04 so far
