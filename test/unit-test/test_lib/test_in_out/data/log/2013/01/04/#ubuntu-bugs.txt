[14:35] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, i'm probably not going to comment - spring semester starts in 3 days, so i'm rushing to get everything ready (books, computer system, local apt mirror so i don't have to rely on some server far away, etc.)
[14:36] <TheLordOfTime> (on the email chain in the controllers list)
[14:36] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: we have time, and you are the lord of it ;-) I am in no hurry
[14:36] <TheLordOfTime> :P

[16:40] <om26er> So I was thinking that if we are going to run bug days there should be something in the IRC channel topic to tell people who is the vanguard (the one or a few to help new people with triage) for the time and people should change shifts
[16:41] <hggdh> om26er: not a bad idea. pedro_ could help there
[16:54] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, point of discussion amongst yourself and bdmurray and whomever else: you may need to add additional bugcontrollers to the ACL at bdmurray's discretion so that if nobody's here, someone else can help set the topic for the bug days. (for the channel)
[16:54] <TheLordOfTime> or, just ask me for the commands - i'm pretty irc-fluent.
[17:03] <hggdh> will check with the bugmeister. I see nothing against it
[17:23] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, would https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sks/+bug/1096116 get the needs-packaging tag/topic note ?
[17:23] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1096116 in sks (Debian) "New version 1.1.4 available" [Undecided,New]
[17:23] <TheLordOfTime> (its filed against Ubuntu too)
[17:24] <TheLordOfTime> (its probably a wishlist bug anyways)
[17:24] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, looks like an ITP (Intent To Package) though, hence the ping.
[17:26] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: the package is being updated on debian, so I think this would be a sync or merge, eventually
[17:26] <TheLordOfTime> so just leave it?
[17:26]  * TheLordOfTime would love to see sks updated though :P
[17:27] <hggdh> I think so. When it is released on Debian, we will act
[18:37] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, yofel, does using 'sudo' break standard bashcompletion?
[18:37] <TheLordOfTime> (regarding my comments on bug 1095180)

[18:48] <njin> hallo can someone assign the package to bug 1096002 ? thanks
[18:48] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1096002 in Ubuntu "Multipath does not work with EMC 5300 Storage" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1096002
[18:49] <TheLordOfTime> njin, which package?
[18:50]  * TheLordOfTime should read more first.
[18:51]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
