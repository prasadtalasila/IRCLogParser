[02:09] <len-1304> zequence, Looking at the jackd logs again. Something looks fishy... funky, out and out strange. (not sure how any of that translates)
[02:13] <len-1304> It looks like: Jackd asks for device, PA gives it up, Jackd aquires it, qjackctl or jack_control try to connect to jackd via dbus and fail, dbus assumes jackd is not running and starts jackd, the second incarnation of jackd cannot acquire device... because jackd 1st instance already did. Everything folds.
[16:05] <zequence> Already had my second update to the kernels done. Some sudden bugfix probably
[16:09] <zequence> ttoine: Perhaps something for Ubuntu Studio to post about? http://www.redsharknews.com/business/item/355-lightworks-for-linux-alpha-test-applications-reopen-for-very-limited-period
[16:10] <holstein> why?
[16:10] <holstein> do we ship it?
[16:11] <holstein> can we ship it... thats the question
[16:12] <zequence> holstein: It's interesting from a multimedia perspective, and Ubuntu Studio should be the centerpoint for that as far as Linux multimedia is concerned
[16:12] <holstein> if it can be
[16:12] <zequence> We don't need to ship something in order to provide info and support for it
[16:19] <zequence> I'm holding a Linux class at the moment. Pretty improvized, and only done two sessions so far. Installed Ubuntu with wubi and explained a bit about the differences between GNU/Linux and other OSs.
[16:19] <zequence> Everyone did their own installs of course
[16:19] <zequence> And this is like the only time I ever use Unity, and Software Center
[16:20] <zequence> Software Center could behave a little better. One guy managed to get his install + upgrade to crash
[16:21] <zequence> Fixed it in the terminal, but I didn't look further into if it was possible to fix in Software Center
[16:21] <zequence> If no, that sort of thing is really not sexy for new users
[16:24] <zequence> I should try it some more
[16:46] <ttoine> zequence, some time in workshop and class, I explain how to install and use synaptic
[16:47] <ttoine> zequence, yes this is interesting
[16:47] <zequence> ttoine: Yeah, I must remember to do that. I've actually stopped using it myself. Only use the terminal these days. I'll be teaching them to use the terminal from now on. We'll be setting up servers and stuff
[16:48] <holstein> zequence: nice
[16:50] <zequence> holstein: Yeah, I'm figuring it's not that difficult is you just explain stuff in a simple way, and progress slowly. There aren't that many tools or builtin bash commands they need to learn in order to use the terminal, and the rest they can google, since they already have a basis for how to get by
[16:51] <zequence> I'll be going through how to orientate in the filesystem. Then apt. 
[16:51] <holstein> file system knowlege is slipping away
[16:51] <holstein> its a shame really
[16:51] <holstein> the iDevices dont share the hard drive like that...
[16:52] <ttoine> zequence, did you apply for a lightwork licence ?
[16:52] <zequence> ttoine: Nope
[16:52] <zequence> Just saw the news before posting it here
[16:52] <ttoine> zequence, for the idevices, there is an option to check in rythmbox
[16:53] <holstein> i dont think there is any way we can include lightworks due to licensing
[16:53] <zequence> ttoine: I've tried rhythmbox with an iPhone, but couldn't make it work that time. I know it has worked in the past. Maybe again, don't know
[16:55] <zequence> registering now
[16:56] <zequence> holstein: Yeah, if it's not going to be libre, I guess not. But, steam is not going to be libre either, and since because of its' great importance for the Ubuntu platform, it deserves attention, as it will make users more likely to be interested in using Ubuntu
[16:57] <zequence> Lightworks might fill a very deep hole for many video folks
[16:58] <holstein> sure, be we cant give it any attention
[16:59] <holstein> we cant "fix" steam
[16:59] <holstein> its made for 12.04... its kind of just the way it is
[16:59] <holstein> it would be nice to have a lightroom live though.. if that is possible
[16:59] <holstein> an unofficial live CD
[17:11] <ttoine> zequence, I will be a linux tester for Lightworks
[17:11] <ttoine> thanks a lot
[17:11] <zequence> ttoine: Ah, great
[17:11] <ttoine> scott-work, any news from Twitter ?
[17:11] <ttoine> zequence, it is my job, to test everything;-)
[17:12] <ttoine> and I agree with you, this is the kind of news we should relay on the blog once everything will be ready
[17:22] <zequence> It seems it's not hard to get alpha access. I got an activation code too
[17:31] <zequence> ttoine: There's no download yet, right? 
[17:32] <scott-work> ttoine: no :(  i filed a notice about impersonation but i haven't heard back since
[17:38] <ttoine> zequence, not yet
[17:39] <ttoine> scott-work, did you contact the guy I gave you the email
[17:40] <scott-work> i did not and i apologize for that. if you provide that information again i will contact him this afternoon
[17:55] <zequence> ttoine: I had a look at your g+ page, and your circles, specifically. I noticed you mostly subscribe to people. I'd encourage you to add pages to organizations, like Ubuntu Studio. This is where I found the news about Lightworks for instance https://plus.google.com/u/0/105875974618718456564/posts
[17:56] <zequence> Libre Graphics World
[17:56] <zequence> There are tons of pages. Some better, some worse
[17:56] <ttoine> zequence, this afternoon I was off
[17:56] <ttoine> but yes, google + is a really good place to find good news
[17:57] <zequence> You use searches? I don't use that a lot, but that's of course another good method
[17:57] <ttoine> zequence, I use google news and rss, twitter, ...
[17:57] <ttoine> it is hard to get everything...
[17:58] <zequence> Since most people I know don't use g+, my circle is mostly just news sources. Yes, it's hard to filter
