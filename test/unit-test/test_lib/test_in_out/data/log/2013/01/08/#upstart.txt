[17:30] <jodh> xnox/stgraber: lp:~jamesodhunt/upstart/setenv+getenv now has working set-env, get-env and list-env. I'll add unset-env and reset-env tomorrow.
[17:30] <stgraber> cool!
[17:31] <xnox> awesome =)
[17:31] <jodh> I also found a nasty bug in d-feet in the process: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/d-feet/+bug/1097303
[17:31] <jodh> that'll teach me to use gui tools :)
[18:13] <toabctl> jodh, about lp #1097303: can you try "true" or tell me the function with the (string, boolean) signature, please?
[20:15] <gansbrest> hello
[20:16] <gansbrest> Is there a way to create a job with attibutes, something like start sevice one, start service two
[20:16] <gansbrest> so I have one service job, but I also supply specific attibutes
[20:17] <gansbrest> based on those attibutes I start/stop different processes
[20:48] <SpamapS> gansbrest: you can pass environment variables into jobs with initctl/start
[20:48] <SpamapS> gansbrest: so 'start jobname FOO=1' will set FOO=1 in the environment of jobname
[20:49] <SpamapS> gansbrest: you can also use the 'instance' keyword to run multiple instances of the same job based on different variable values.
[20:49] <SpamapS> gansbrest: you might notice that each network interface has its own instance of the 'network-interface' job
[21:19] <gansbrest> wow, this is useful info, thanks a lot!!
[21:33] <JanC> gansbrest: be sure to read the upstart cookbook (see /topic )
[21:33] <gansbrest> yes yes, I'm reading it now, it looks exactly like I need 
[21:34] <gansbrest> http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#instance
[21:34] <JanC> â˜º
[21:34] <JanC> and I mean read the whole cookbook, it has lots of useful information & tips
