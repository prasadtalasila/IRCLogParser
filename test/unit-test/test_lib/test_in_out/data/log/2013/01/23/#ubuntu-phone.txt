[11:37] <tinti> hi, is there a channel for Ubuntu for Android?
[11:37] <tinti> http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android
[11:39] <tinti> is it deprecated in favor of ubuntu-phone?
[11:39] <popey> no
[11:39] <popey> they are two separate products
[11:41] <tinti> popey: nice, but in canonical page when I do "Get in touch" I am redirect to ubuntu phone "Get in touch"
[11:41] <popey> its the same team that you'd be getting in touch with
[11:41] <tinti> I am really interested on Android + Ubuntu and also Ubuntu in a phone.
[11:42] <tinti> thanks popey
[11:42] <Tak> actually, will ubuntu phone have a UfA-like integration?
[11:47] <tinti> Tak: like motorola atrix?
[12:02] <Tak> I don't know
[12:30] <Sinan___> hi
[12:34] <Sinan___> How is Ubuntu-phone going to solve GPU problems for arm chipsets since their driver source codes are mostly closed?
[12:34] <Sinan___> Most of video demonstrations show that hardware video acceleration is not working in Ubuntu-phone.

[16:44] <okan_> hello !
[16:44] <okan_> does anyone know when the img available for download ?
[16:44] <k1l> okan_: you saw the /topic ?
[16:45] <okan_> no
[16:46] <k1l> then reaad the topic, it will answer your question :)
[16:46] <okan_> can u send me plz the link for topic ? :)
[16:47] <k1l> okan_: type "/topic" int your irc client or scroll up to the the topic when its displayed when you enter the room
[16:47] <hourd> type "/topic" or it should be at thd top of youf irc client
[16:47] <okan_> ty
[18:12] <Sinan___> is here anybody alive?
[18:13] <hourd> I hope so otherwise it is a strange afterlife
[18:13] <Sinan___> :)
[18:14] <Sinan___> I'm curious about ubuntu phone and hardware video acceleration for arm GPUs
[18:14] <Sinan___> all the video demonstration I saw showing that there is no sign of that
[18:14] <Sinan___> no HW GPU acceleration
[18:15] <popey> there is HW GPU acceleration
[18:15] <popey> i watched a hardware accelerated 1080p Iron Man 3 trailer on the device in the bar last week ☺
[18:15] <Sinan___> are you sure? Is h264 video playback HW aacelerated
[18:15] <Sinan___> umm nice then
[18:16] <Sinan___> AFAIK it's hard to support GPU acceleration since most of arm gpu's source codes are not open
[18:16] <Sinan___> especially exynos platform
[18:17] <popey> Well, that makes it even more awesome ☺
[18:19] <Sinan___> not only arm phones, arm usb sticks have no open source gpu drivers. On youtube you see video playback on usb sticks are very laggy
[18:19] <Sinan___> due to SW decoding
[18:19] <Sinan___> popey what device do you have?
[18:19] <Sinan___> nexus 4?
[18:20] <popey> I personally have an iPhone
[18:20] <Sinan___> so how do you run Ubuntu-phone?
[18:20] <popey> But I played with a Galaxy Nexus running Ubuntu Phone.
[18:21] <hourd> Sinan___: the device all the ubunut phone stuff is being demod on is the samsung galaxy nexus not the nexus 4
[18:21] <Sinan___> the one that has single core cpu?
[18:21] <hourd> its dual core as far as i know
[18:22] <Sinan___> umm
[18:22] <Sinan___> let me check its gpu
[18:22] <popey> powervr
[18:22] <popey> SGX540
[18:23] <popey> dual core 1.2GHz A9 cpu
[18:23] <Sinan___> aah that one already has an open source driver from TI, right?
[18:25] <Sinan___> I have a note 2 and I'm wondering that whether I'll be able to use Ubuntu-Phone on it.
[18:26] <hourd> i'm tempted to ubuntu up my nexus 7
[18:27] <Sinan___> Because Samsung is the worst developer friendly company and they don't share anything about their exynos platform
[18:28] <Sinan___> Without source codes I'm wonder what ubuntu developers are going to do :S
[18:28] <Sinan___> wondering*
[18:29] <unbas> Buenas tardes, hay alguien en la sala de habla hispana?
[18:30] <Sinan___> Raspberry PI has an opensource gpu driver but its cpu is armv6 not v7
[18:30] <popey> the RPi GPU driver is _not_ open source
[18:30] <Sinan___> but they claim so
[18:30] <Sinan___> at least HW video decoding is working
[18:31] <Sinan___> I saw it in their videos
[18:31] <popey> AIUI there's an open source shim behind which there's a binary blob
[18:31] <popey> http://airlied.livejournal.com/76383.html
[18:32] <Sinan___> let me read
[18:33] <Sinan___> damn :@
[18:35] <hourd> Its a bit of a cheat
[18:35] <Sinan___> I really don't understand, why the hell they don't share their sources? what's the purpose?
[18:38] <popey> the usual reasons "we can't because it would release secrets about our platform / device", and "we can't because bits were sublicensed from others, so we aren't allowed"
[18:39] <hourd> business
[18:39] <Sinan___> I have Galaxy Note 2 and it has Mali-400 GPU. Without gpu driver I won't be able to have GPU acceleration in Ubuntu-phone which will make it useless (for me):@
[18:41] <Sinan___> So what about phone that will shipped with ubuntu-phone os? Will ubuntu developer be getting driver source codes for them?
[18:42] <Sinan___> by the way apologize for my english grammar mistakes, it's not my first language
[18:52] <popey> Sinan___: yes, we'll release source for what we can
[18:53] <Sinan___> Well, my next device will be an Ubuntu-Phone then :) if my note 2 will not be supported
[19:13] <rZr> jono, I have a qml text editor app to be ported to ubuntu phone
[19:50] <atc3030> is there source that is readily available for this? even if it is not complete or a already built image for any device?
[19:53] <disharmonic> atc3030, i believe Canonical will release the source along with the Nexus image in February(iirc)
[19:53] <atc3030> ok. i didn't know if this was the official channel. thanks
[19:55] <disharmonic> I believe this is the official unofficial channel :P
[19:55] <Sinan___> lol
[19:57] <atc3030> that works
[20:06] <jono> rZr, nice!
[20:07] <rZr> thx
[20:26] <tim_> hello
[20:33] <tim_> is anyone talking on this channel?
[20:33] <mhall119> for those who haven't seen: http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/01/23/community-driven-ubuntu-phone-core-apps/
[20:40] <tim_> well i think having a terminal by default in the os is not a good idea if its marketed further than ubuntu users
[20:42] <bef0rd> nice mhall119
[20:45] <rZr> it is
[20:45] <rZr> a text editor would be suitable too
[20:46] <Selimeren> türk var mı türk :D
[20:46] <Sinan___> may be why ?
[20:46] <Selimeren> merak :D
[20:47] <Sinan___> I don't think any non-English language is allowed here
[20:48] <Selimeren> Okay
[20:48] <Sinan___> ;)
[20:49] <k1l> the early adopters will definitely demand a terminal. even if they will never need one
[20:50] <hourd> yes i would want a terminal
[20:52] <mhall119> Sinan___: Selimeren: it's not that non-English isn't allowed, it's just that you'll find more people who can understand it
[20:53] <Sinan___> I don't really know the rules I just guessed so
[20:53] <Sinan___> many forums don't allow non-english talk
[20:53] <Sinan___> many forums, chat rooms etc
[21:07] <surgemcgee> I have a quick question regarding the xmlListModel. Is it good practice to utilize many xmlListmodels containing only one source file declaration? Or should there be only one xmlListModel is only one source file is used? Also, where can I find some good examples of Ubuntu-apps? Launchpad?
=== SkavenXXI-[OFF] is now known as SkavenXXI
[21:09] <surgemcgee> In other words, there should not be more than one source: entry to the same url.
[21:19] <surgemcgee> Surgemcgee - [OFF] has changed to HTTP 404 [Not Found]
[21:25] <n-iCe> hello guys
[21:25] <n-iCe> is ubuntu available for download?
[21:26] <surgemcgee> is this HTTP 406 ?
[21:26] <surgemcgee> It feels like a have HTTP 300
[21:27] <mhall119> n-iCe: Ubuntu desktop and server are available to download, not the phone images yet
[21:28] <alo21> hi all... where can I find a useful guide about qml syntax?
[21:31] <mhall119> alo21: you mean a guide to writing an app using QML, or syntax documentation about QML itself?
[21:31] <n-iCe> mhall119: thanks
[21:31] <surgemcgee> http://www.questml.com/syntax/ `Surgemcgee gets +1 points to 2pt total`
[21:33] <alo21> mhall119, if I understood well, QML is just to manage GUI, the core is Java. Right?
[21:33] <mhall119> alo21: no, no Java at all
[21:34] <mhall119> you can use Javascript (not related to java, despite the name) to your QML app to provide logic and controls and stuff
[21:34] <Selimeren> Hi, I want to ask some questions. Which phone should I buy to install Ubuntu?
[21:34] <mhall119> Selimeren: initial phone images will be for the Galaxy Nexus GSM phone
[21:35] <alo21> mhall119, OK... change my question. Is there some teams which are writing apps for the phone? If yes where are they?
[21:35] <mhall119> alo21: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-phone-coreapps is the list of planned default apps
[21:36] <mhall119> see http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/01/23/community-driven-ubuntu-phone-core-apps/ for more information about how those are going to be developed
[21:36] <mhall119> alo21: there's also a G+ community: http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/01/23/community-driven-ubuntu-phone-core-apps/
[21:37] <Selimeren> Can I use android and ubuntu on my phone same time ?
[21:37] <mhall119> no
[21:37] <alo21> mhall119, I would be part of the team and helping coding. I setted all up and I am going to subscribe ML. What else should I do?
[21:39] <mhall119> alo21: have you filled out this form? http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/#step-get-involved
[21:39] <alo21> mhall119, yes I did
[21:41] <mhall119> alo21: in that case you can either wait to see if there's an opening on one of those apps, or start writing your own
[21:41] <Selimeren> I want to use ubuntu on my phone and I need to test my apps (I am developer) on android and ubuntu too. What can I do when I install it ?
[21:43] <alo21> mhall119, Will I receive an email when if an app becomes open?
[21:45] <mhall119> alo21: yes, you'll get an invite, probably from david planella (dpm)
[21:45] <alo21> OK
[21:45] <mhall119> Selimeren: we will provide a device emulator you can use
[21:47] <Selimeren> mhall119, Thanks for your answers. I can't wait for install it on my phone. I didn't buy Galaxy Nexus yet but I will buy it for install Ubuntu. I hope I can buy it before release date.
[21:48] <n-iCe> will it be available only for nexus?
[21:48] <alo21> mhall119, I hope to be part of this amazing adventure!
[21:48] <mhall119> n-iCe: that's all we're sure about right now
[21:49] <n-iCe> sad
[21:49] <n-iCe> I got a Gs3
[21:49] <mhall119> n-iCe: all the source code will be available though, so I'm sure images for other phones will be produced

[22:02] <alo21> sorry. Wrong channel
[22:59] <salvarez01> hello
[23:04] <aliendude5300> I signed up to get involved as a volunteer developer, and I never got a reply back indicating that I was accepted to work on any of the core applications as mentioned on Jono Bacon's blog. Is there anything I can do to contribute? I'm not good at graphics design, but I can write code.
[23:05] <couscous> hello world !
[23:06] <GetTheLot> Lol
[23:08] <aliendude5300> I take it that (almost) nobody is here...
[23:15] <bkerensa> ;0
[23:16] <bkerensa> aliendude5300: someone will likely be in touch if there is a good match
[23:43] <GuidoPallemans> aliendude5300: they got 1500+ signups, so I guess they just picked the more advanced ones...
