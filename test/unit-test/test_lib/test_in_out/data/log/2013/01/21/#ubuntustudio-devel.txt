[01:17] <micahg> ScottL: idk if I'll be at UDS, I'd like to go, but it's not a for sure at this point
[01:18] <micahg> ScottL: as for meta uploads, those are easy, so I don't mind, it's just an update script + build test + upload
[03:02] <micahg> ScottL: did you want a meta upload
[03:03] <len-1304> micahg, from his comment at 1030 (my time this morning) it would seem that whenever you get to it yes.
[03:03] <len-1304> <ScottL> i added synfigstudio to the graphcis and video seeds. whenever the metas get updated is okay (i think)
[03:04] <micahg> len-1304: ah, ok
[03:07] <len-1304> micahg, I am not sure what happened, but it seems -icon-theme got uploaded, (it showed up on my 13.04 update) but the web page doesn't show the release.
[03:07] <len-1304> https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntustudio-dev/ubuntustudio-icon-theme/UbuntuStudio
[03:07] <micahg> len-1304: ooh, forgot to push I think
[03:08] <len-1304> -default-settings too... or is it done? I don't see the changes
[03:08] <micahg> no, that still needs uploading
[03:08] <len-1304> OK
[03:09] <micahg> -icon-theme pushed
[03:09] <len-1304> Thank you
[03:10] <micahg> sorry about that
[03:10] <len-1304> NP, I haven't taken as much on this cycle, Life has more stuff for me to do.
[03:10]  * micahg is updating the meta now
[03:39] <micahg> meta uploaded
[13:21] <scott-work> good morning everyone :_D
[13:21] <scott-work> oops   :-D
[13:36] <smartboyhw> scott-work, hello
[13:36]  * smartboyhw is quite happy today
[13:36] <smartboyhw> Got first in Physics!
[13:38] <scott-work> congratulations! that is very commendable
[13:38]  * scott-work liked physics in school along with math
[13:39] <smartboyhw> scott-work, they are for tech guys:P
[13:39] <scott-work> hehe, true
[13:40] <scott-work> micahg: i would like to get bug #1057816 behind us. can you re-explain the options so i can make some changes and fix this?
[13:40] <ubottu> bug 1057816 in livecd-rootfs (Ubuntu) "ubuntustudio live ISO does not include publishing and photography metas even though seeds are configured to do so." [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1057816
[13:40] <smartboyhw> oh!?
[13:40] <smartboyhw> scott-work, BTW you or zequence want to do a User Days session? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDays
[13:41] <scott-work> smartboyhw: that is possible for me to do
[13:42] <zequence> I won't have the time :(
[13:42] <micahg> scott-work: hrm?  they should be available in quantal and later
[13:42] <smartboyhw> zequence, oh...
[13:42] <scott-work> micahg: i think we were previously talking about fixing this in precise and SRU the update, is this possible or practicle?
[13:43] <scott-work> practical
[13:43] <smartboyhw> scott-work, ah!
[13:43]  * smartboyhw thought scott-work is talking about raring:P
[13:44] <micahg> scott-work: I guess we could SRU the livecd-rootfs and meta changes to precise if that's what you want, old users still won't get them on upgrade though (Bug #1066401)
[13:44] <ubottu> bug 1066401 in ubuntustudio-meta (Ubuntu) "distribution upgrade to 12.10 omits two metas" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1066401
[13:45] <smartboyhw> That is the biggest problem
[13:46] <scott-work> hmmmm, _that_ i need to think about while i'm not working :P  i will think through this this afternoon and have a direction at that time
[13:46] <scott-work> although i might still ask a few questions before having a decision ;)
[13:48] <micahg> sure
[14:23] <smartboyhw> scott-work, len-1304 a question: Is ubuntustudio-icon-theme now an enough replacement to xubuntu-icon-theme? If yes than we can remove it from our seeds
[14:27] <micahg> smartboyhw:' apt-cache show ubuntustudio-icon-theme | grep Depends' should answer your question if you're on raring
[14:27] <micahg> or reading the description of the package
[14:27] <smartboyhw> micahg, oops:P
[14:31]  * smartboyhw yawns
[18:19] <scott-work> micahg: it looks like the fix for bug#1057816 takes care of the items on the blueprint/status.ubuntu.com (which was my original primary concern)
[18:19] <scott-work> micahg: do you have a suggestion for fixing bug#1066401?
[18:20] <scott-work> i'm not sure that a dummy package (which is really my only experience in somewhat-similar circumstances) is appropriate
[18:25] <scott-work> zequence: didn't we file an RT ticket about getting email address for @ubuntustudio.com
[18:25] <scott-work> ?
[18:25] <zequence> scott-work: We did
[18:26] <scott-work> i will mark it as done on the blueprint then. thanks :)
[18:27] <scott-work> zequence: did you notice that many of our blueprints do not show up on status.ubuntu.com? i presume that was intentional
[18:27] <zequence> scott-work: Only the ones that are tied to the raring bluepring
[18:27] <zequence> blueprint
[18:28] <scott-work> oh, oh. that's right. we had talked about this before.
[18:28] <scott-work> sorry. i remember now
[18:28] <zequence> scott-work: Did you make more dependencies? Seems like they all depend on the permanent blueprint
[18:29] <scott-work> i haven't changed anything other than marking "done" or "inprogress"
[18:29] <zequence> This changed some time ago. Maybe a couple of months ago
[18:29] <scott-work> i noticed what you are describing yesterday and by accident
[18:31] <scott-work> errr, micahg , i am wrong about the bugs and the blueprint: bug#1066401 is what the blueprint is describing. however, we are still at the same point with me asking if you have any suggestions ;)
[18:32] <scott-work> i notice that 12.04.2 is schedule in the upcoming months, would that be a good time to address this?
[19:40] <scott-work> ttoine: i got an answer from twitter last night. i should respond this afternoon to it to get the right username :-D
[19:50] <ttoine> scott-work, great news !!
[19:50] <ttoine> scott-work, we have done the fisrt mixes on the mixbus workstation
[19:51] <ttoine> quite good, just a bug with 3 harrison plugins because of OpenGL and the catalyst drive
[19:51] <ttoine> drvier
[19:51] <ttoine> driver
[19:53] <ttoine> scott-work, any news for the ubuntustudio.org emails ?
[19:58] <scott-work> ttoine: good news about the mixes, but i don't have any news about the emails
[20:03] <zequence> ttoine: scott-work: Whenever there will be a change about the email, we'll all be notified, as I put us all as requestors
[20:04] <zequence> ..about the @ubuntustudio.org emails, that is
[20:45] <scott-work> added 'ubuntu studio' to this page: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDays
[20:45] <scott-work> just to the line that says" check out these great products!"
[20:46] <scott-work> is kinda disappointing that we keep getting left off of these things from time to time, but of course, i have been adding us into them ;)
[20:47] <ttoine> ;-)
[20:53] <zequence> Got some ideas from this http://alias.sh/
[20:54] <zequence> Takes a while to learn how to make use of the tools you have
[20:54] <ttoine> what is for ?
[20:55] <scott-work> something with a .sh extension makes me nervous to click
[20:55] <zequence> It's a way to store bash_alias in the cloud. But, just using aliases can improve your workflow
[20:56] <zequence> Like, an alias for preparing your system for development: prepare-dev. And that would install all the stuff you need
[20:56] <scott-work> kinda like 'sudo apt-get install build-essential' ;P
[20:56] <scott-work> but really you need to install more than just that, sadly :/
[20:57] <zequence> There are a lot of examples on aliases at the site
[20:58] <zequence> I use scripts for some things, which is basically the same thing, only I don't have a command for it. I need to find the script to execute it
[21:03] <zequence> I guess this one might be handy for a lot of people http://alias.sh/extract-most-know-archives-one-command
[21:05] <zequence> So, that would create an alias called extract, which would be like a multipurpose decompressor. You do: extract <myfile>, and you don't need to know which command goes with which file format.
[21:16] <len-1304> scott-work, The only way I can think to add metas to an already released ISO is to add them to the desktop meta for that ISO.
[21:17] <len-1304> Then when the user updates the desktop iso, the new metas will get added.
[21:17] <zequence> btw, we don't have a tasksel for our desktop atm
[21:17] <zequence> We should change that
[21:18] <len-1304> zequence, what is tasksel?
[21:18] <scott-work> zequence: the idea was to use the ubiquity plugin to choose which packages to install
[21:18] <scott-work> len-1304: tasksel is what we used before that looks like ncurses and lets you choose which meta to install
[21:18] <len-1304> Have to create the plugin...
[21:18] <len-1304> Ok
[21:18] <len-1304> I remember.
[21:18] <scott-work> i would really like to complete this as well
[21:19] <len-1304> Didn't know it had a name.
[21:19] <zequence> len-1304: If you install using the Ubuntu netinstall image, you get to choose which desktop and some other choices too. Those are tasksels. There are some for servers too
[21:19] <scott-work> just for the record :P   http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_SxnEyE2bzLI/SCcL-79UzrI/AAAAAAAAC4c/_5d0nA35qOU/s400/34dscn2301.jpg
[21:19] <zequence> We should have both
[21:19] <len-1304> Any of the alt disks.
[21:19] <zequence> Well, I don't think there are any other alt disks anymore
[21:20] <scott-work> nope, just live-dvd
[21:20] <len-1304> zubuntu?
[21:20] <len-1304> opps xubuntu
[21:20] <zequence> Ah, maybe the other flavors have, yeah
[21:20] <scott-work> i was hoping janne would finish the plugin but i don't think it will happen
[21:20] <scott-work> does anyone want to take on finishing the plugin?
[21:21] <zequence> There was talk about minimizing the amount of metas too. I think we should do that also. One for each workflow
[21:21] <len-1304> I am still learning a bit of python
[21:21] <scott-work> zequence: would that minimize them?
[21:22] <len-1304> scott-work, there are three or four audio metas. Two would be enough.
[21:22] <len-1304> (one for plugins)
[21:22] <len-1304> We may not even need that as I don't know any good reason to install audio without them.
[21:23] <zequence> I could see the point in either having just one for each workflow, which would be our standard set of apps. Then, maybe also another one called -extra
[21:23] <zequence> The -extra meta would never be on the DVD
[21:23] <zequence> How about that?
[21:23] <scott-work> hmmm. i forgot about the audio-common, but would you want to not separate the "record your band (recording)" and "i can't play any instruments (generation)" metas then?
[21:24] <scott-work> sorry, that was directed at len-1304 ^^^
[21:24] <len-1304> I figured :)
[21:24] <scott-work> oh, hehe :)
[21:25] <zequence> If we had ubuntustudio-audio, -video, -graphics, etc. Those would be on the DVD. Then, ubuntustudio-audio-extra, -video-extra. Those would be installable over the net, and would give the user anything that would make sense including
[21:25] <len-1304> The problem is, that the generation should depend on the plugins... but recording does as well for effects
[21:26] <len-1304> Even recording a band, if there is a keyboard player, they will probably be one of the computer people and want to record their part as midi to play with later.
[21:27] <len-1304> scott-work, I don't see a real reason to keep generation separate.
[21:28] <zequence> I don't see the reason to keep anything separate. It's not that big of a deal to install the full set, if we keep it polished
[21:28] <zequence> Per workflow, that is
[21:28] <zequence> I'm thinking a little iMaccy there
[21:29] <len-1304> I think I agree.
[21:29] <zequence> And during install, it would be nice to have a plugin in ubiquity that had only the workflows, and maybe also -extra which would then require network to install
[21:29] <zequence> But, probably I'd just prefer to see one for each workflow, during install anyway
[21:30] <len-1304> IS it possible to have a ubiquity plugin run tasksel?
[21:30] <zequence> It might even be preferable for us to have the option of installing -generic over the network, instead of -lowlatency, for those that do not use audio apps at all
[21:30] <scott-work> len-1304: i'm not sure we have the expertise in channel to answer that question
[21:31] <scott-work> stefan graber would the one who wrote the ubiqutiy plugin (i believe)
[21:32] <len-1304> I suspect it would be just as easy to write a plugin that does the job.
[21:32] <zequence> len-1304: Instead of keeping metas and tasksels for them?
[21:33] <len-1304> Instead? we would still need the metas.
[21:33] <zequence> Yeah
[21:33] <len-1304> tasksel means it is possible to install from the netiso
[21:33] <scott-work> if you two think that combining the 'generation' and 'recording' metas into a single one is okay, then i'm on board as well
[21:33] <zequence> And the tasksels might not be priority, but those should fall in line with everything else of course
[21:34] <zequence> So, what do guys think of keeping -extra metas for all those apps that are nice, but won't fit into a standard DVD install?
[21:35] <zequence> For audio, we could add all the plugins there, for example
[21:35] <zequence> While keeping a smaller but highly functional set in the ubuntustudio-audio meta
[21:38] <zequence> Another idea is to have more extras. ubuntustudio-audio-extra-plugins, ubuntustudio-audio-extra-sequencers, etc. 
[21:38] <zequence> It's a nice way to browser for apps, when you can find them all in one place
[21:38] <zequence> browse*
[21:39] <zequence> And some might want to have the entire set for a specific workflow as well
[21:43] <zequence> net split?
[21:44] <zequence> Len-nb: The -extra in the menu are nice. I guess those are already quite valuable. But, those could also be made into specific metas. Too many metas could be a problem too of course
[21:44] <zequence> Just an idea. I'd settle for just keeping the workflow metas for now, and as for broader content, I guess there are many ways to achieve that
[21:55] <zequence> btw, what is this? https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntustudio-dev/ffmpeg/debian.git
[22:01] <scott-work> zequence: i think the plugins are a necessity for audio, not sure i would want them inside a package with a bunch of other items
[22:02] <scott-work> also, i second "<zequence> Just an idea. I'd settle for just keeping the workflow metas for now, and as for broader content, I guess there are many ways to achieve that"
[22:02] <scott-work> let's make the change, evaluate, then make changes as needed
[22:03] <scott-work> zequence: that code^^^, i didn't click the link at this point, but i believe we (ubuntu or ubuntustudio, i think it's us though) roll a special ffmpeg version, but can't remember why
[22:04] <scott-work> oh yeah, that's rexbron's copy of it he "maintains". i think it's for the libav-code-extras-53 package or something similar
[22:07] <scott-work> Len-nb: zequence: do either one of you want to volunteer to work out the plugin? if not, i'll see if i can tackle it next cycle then
[22:12] <zequence> scott-work: I'll have a look at it. You know where the source is/goes?
[22:14] <scott-work> zequence: for the plugin? there was some code that janne was working on. i will look now....
[22:15] <scott-work> zequence: https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntustudio-dev/ubuntustudio-live/ubuntustudio-live.precise
[22:15] <scott-work> edubuntu would be a good resource as well as they use this
[22:17] <scott-work> also, this had good information when we were researching the plugin: https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-p-ubuntustudio-livedvd
[22:17] <zequence> scott-work: Thanks. I'll have a look at it during the week.
[22:22] <scott-work> zequence: if you can get this working that would be exceptionally sweet.
[22:23] <scott-work> i feel like we get too wrapped up in audio and in order to help make this nice for other disciplines who want to install stuff.
[22:23] <scott-work> oh, that sentence should have "having this options would be very, very good." ;)
[22:25] <ttoine> wow. RME USB sound cards are getting USB 2 audio class complients, in order to work with the ipad
[22:25] <scott-work> Len-nb: so if we add the photography and publishing meta to the desktop seeds, then users should get this when they update ubuntu studio and it should come in as default for 12.04.02. is this correct?
[22:26] <ttoine> the benefice is that once Alsa will fix some bugs in the usb2 audio driver, those sound cards will works out of the box
[22:26] <ttoine> can't wait !
[22:31] <len-1304> scott-work, that should do it. Then I think 12.10 takes care of itself.
[22:33] <len-1304> The only thing to look for is that the 12.04 seeds are correct for those two metas.
[22:33] <len-1304> I haven't looked.
[22:33] <len-1304> We fixed them in 12.10
[22:33]  * len-1304 is picking kids up.
[23:01] <scott-work> len-1304: i'll compare 12.10 photography and publishing metas to what is in 12.04 and then update the 12.04 desktop in the next couple of days then
[23:02] <scott-work> i'll probably confirm with micahg that i'm not doing anything wrong first through
[23:02] <scott-work> but for now, i'm going home
