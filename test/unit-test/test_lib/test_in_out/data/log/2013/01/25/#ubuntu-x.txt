[00:31] <Sarvatt> hmm, unity dash is much slower in mesa 9.1 than 9.0 on ivybridge
[03:36] <agrestringere> Can anyone look at a bug and give me guidance on how to proceed triaging?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/xubuntu-desktop/+bug/1015297

[19:00] <GeoffCh> Just a heads-up:  after yesterday's upgrade of libdrm-intel1, libdrm-nouveau1a, libdrm-radeon1 and  libdrm2 to 2.4.39-0ubuntu0.1 on 12.10, my Arrandale GPU has started to hang randomly.  Here's a trace from syslog:  http://pastie.org/5860453 ... Since I'm using drm_kms_helper to override EDID, I'm not sure this will affect others.
[19:03] <GeoffCh> Oops, I meant on 12.04
[19:30] <tjaalton> GeoffCh: please file a bug
[19:31] <tjaalton> ubuntu-bug libdrm should do the trick
[19:31] <GeoffCh> OK.  Not sure if it would be a dup of this:  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-intel/+bug/1081009
[19:31] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1081009 in xserver-xorg-video-intel (Ubuntu) "[arrandale] GPU lockup IPEHR: 0x02000022" [High,Fix released]
[19:32] <tjaalton> that was a kernel bug
[19:43] <GeoffCh> Thanks tjaalton ... bug report is in.
[22:44] <wrouesnel> so kernel 3.5.0.22 is breaking multi-monitor setups with the radeon driver. I'm not entirely sure where to file this.
