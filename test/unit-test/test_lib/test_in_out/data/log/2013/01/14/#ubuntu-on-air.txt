[19:36] <benkaiser> QUESTION: How is landscape orientation on the phone? I have not seen it in any of the demo's
[19:37] <DaveAllen> ^About my previous question regarding a Media Player, I understand what you said, but if you take a look at the OS market, both your competitors have native-looking Media Players. MacOSX-Itunes and MS Windows-Windows Media Player. Rhythmbox is no match for those two right now, neither in the looks nor in the usability department...

[19:53] <Sid__> QUESTION: I saw a music player app on the phone, which I believe was just a picture. Are you guys working on a music player or webbrowser app?
[19:55] <zebaszp> Jono, I know android apps aren't designed for ubuntu, and that's why they're windowed, but that to me is a tad too ugly. Really happy the Ubuntu SDK does include it, though! And tablets, too!
[19:55] <Andke> Q: is there any method, that will bring attention to serous bugs like gvfs-smb, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gvfs/+bug/1075923  ?  Such bugs are a show-stopper to any professional use/corporate use of Ubuntu, and does not seem to get any attention.

[19:59] <sarcasmrules> Question: are you providing the OS for the Steam Box?
[19:59] <OpenTangent> QUESTION: Have Google expressed any interest in releasing native apps? Google Maps for example.
[20:00] <noneofthem> Will the calender on the desktop get some new features like Google integration? Right now there is not much one can do with it. It would be great to get notifications for events etc.
