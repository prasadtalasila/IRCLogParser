[01:07] <bdmurray> bug 1101027 could use some verifying
[01:07] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1101027 in asunder (Ubuntu) "most people use 192 but asunder users can't" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1101027
[01:30] <antarus> ok so now I need the bash maintainer..
[01:31] <antarus> doko or steve eh
[01:32] <antarus> hrm these sponsorship instructions look old :/
[01:32] <TheLordOfTime> antarus, what're you trying to do, if I may ask?
[01:35] <antarus> https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/bash/+bug/778627
[01:35] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 778627 in bash (Ubuntu) "In natty, bash completion now quotes shell variable references rather than expanding them" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[01:35] <antarus> I uploaded a debdiff to fix that bug
[01:36] <antarus> I'm looking for a sponsor to upload it to proposed, and then nominate for SRU
[01:36] <TheLordOfTime> subscribe ubuntu-sponsors and the sru team, but first, can you tell me which versions are actually affected?
[01:36] <TheLordOfTime> i.e. precise, oneiric,...
[01:36] <TheLordOfTime> i can see in the bug it says quantal/raring unaffected
[01:37] <TheLordOfTime> ... oh that reminds me i need to ping the release team about an SRU... :p
[01:37] <antarus> the users on the bug reported the breakage first in natty
[01:37] <antarus> and it was still broken in P
[01:37] <TheLordOfTime> antarus, natty's EOL
[01:37] <antarus> so I assume N, O, P
[01:37] <TheLordOfTime> i was asking about what releases you have personally seen it in.
[01:37] <antarus> oh
[01:37] <TheLordOfTime> i.e.
[01:37] <antarus> I only run LTS
[01:37] <antarus> so just P
[01:37] <TheLordOfTime> did you confirm oneiric is affected?  and that precise is affected?
[01:38] <antarus> I can definately confirm Precise is affected
[01:38] <antarus> I have no O machines
[01:38] <TheLordOfTime> OK i'm going to nominate that bug for P, but i'd like to see whether O is also impacted because if so it'll need an SRU for O too
[01:38] <antarus> but I can download its bash and reproduce
[01:38] <TheLordOfTime> although in april we can ignore it :P
[01:38] <antarus> heh
[01:38] <TheLordOfTime> s/in/after/
[01:39] <antarus> Yeah we are quickly getting everyone off of lucid before it falls off of a cliff ;)
[01:39] <TheLordOfTime> s/lucid/oneiric/
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> last i checked lucid is also an LTS
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> and doesn't die yet
[01:40] <antarus> it dies soon ;)
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> desktop dies, but not server :P
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> desktop is in april, server's 2015
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> :)
[01:40] <antarus> I only care about desktop ;)
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> ANYWAYS
[01:41] <TheLordOfTime> i've nominated the bug for Precise, but i've also commented saying i'd like to see if its seen in Oneiric too
[01:41] <antarus> yes, let me check O's bash
[01:42] <TheLordOfTime> antarus, i'll be kind and help you out in subscribing sponsors and the SRU team, but in future, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates#Procedure is useful.  :)
[01:43] <epikvision> Hey TheLordOfTime!
[01:43] <TheLordOfTime> but first, i have to kill this windows server that's being stupid
[01:44]  * TheLordOfTime waves to epikvision
[01:44] <epikvision> seems we're getting a lot done so far.  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/20130117
[01:44] <TheLordOfTime> bleh i've only been around for about 30 minutes
[01:44] <TheLordOfTime> given i had other obligations today :P
[01:44] <antarus> TheLordOfTime: Yeah I'm still trying to get the hang of this process ;)
[01:44] <antarus> I appreciate the help
[01:44] <TheLordOfTime> antarus, no problem :)
[01:44] <antarus> I have about a dozen more of these to do ;)
[01:45] <TheLordOfTime> i'll subscribe sponsors and SRU for you, fi you want send me the other bugs as well with details of releases affected
[01:45] <antarus> most of them will require more work on my part yet
[01:46]  * antarus doesn't have the backports done
[01:46] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[01:46] <antarus> or patches, or debdiffs, or whathaveyou
[01:46] <TheLordOfTime> antarus, i subscribed sponsors and sru to that bug
[01:46] <antarus> thanks
[01:46] <TheLordOfTime> (but also, the link i gave you explainsi which iteams you subscribe)
[01:46] <TheLordOfTime> EVIL KEY!  *points to the random 'i' charactersi showing iup.*
[01:48] <TheLordOfTime> hiya jbicha!
[01:50] <antarus> I guess bug 1099987 is easy, but I think it is also broken in debian.
[01:50] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1099987 in bash (Ubuntu) "/etc/skel/.profile does not detect bash properly" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099987
[01:50] <antarus> it looks like doko maintains bash in both though?
[01:52] <TheLordOfTime> is the bug filed in Debian yet?
[01:52] <antarus> no, I will do that
[01:52] <TheLordOfTime> i meant, did you see if someone else filed the bug in debian yet.
[01:52] <TheLordOfTime> actually, strike that, i'll just go check
[01:52]  * TheLordOfTime pulls up bugs.d.o
[01:52] <antarus> we searched
[01:52] <antarus> didn't find anything
[01:53] <TheLordOfTime> meh its alright, this gives me the chance to test my search script :P
[01:53] <antarus> its not strictly clear if it is bug
[01:53] <antarus> or just WAI
[01:53] <antarus> in which case I'll just patch it internally
[01:54] <antarus> The main problem is that lightdm-session runs in posix mode, but sources $HOME/.profile. $BASH_VERSION is *set* in posix mode, so posix-only bash ends up sourcing ~/.bashrc
[01:54] <antarus> and dies when ~/.bashrc contains bashisms
[01:55] <antarus> (and then lightdm restarts)
[01:55] <antarus> its awesome
[01:55] <antarus> (ly bad)
[01:55] <TheLordOfTime> okay, interesting question.  and i apologize, my specialization is in server packages, but wouldn't this then be a conflict between lightdm-session and bash?
[01:56] <TheLordOfTime> and not necessarily a bash bug?
[01:56] <antarus> Sorry, Conflict being like a package conflict?
[01:56] <antarus> Its not a bug in bash the shell; but the bash package ships /etc/skel/.profile
[01:56] <TheLordOfTime> ah okay, that's what i missed
[01:56]  * TheLordOfTime had a lag spike
[01:56] <antarus> and it is my believe that /etc/skel/.profile is busted in this way
[01:56] <antarus> but I could be convinced otherwise ;p
[01:57] <antarus> Its also not clear if /etc/skel/.profile is sourced by non-bourne shells
[01:57] <TheLordOfTime> as i said, my specialization is in server packages, so... ;P
[01:57] <TheLordOfTime> forgive semi-noobish questions such as the one i asked ;P
[01:57] <TheLordOfTime> ... aw crap, not again
[01:57]  * TheLordOfTime walks off to fix apt-mirror again
[01:57] <antarus> ahh good old apt
[01:58] <antarus> the only stupid question is teh question left unasked, etc...
[02:09] <TheLordOfTime> meh, apt mirror's a different piece of work :P
[02:09] <TheLordOfTime> its evilish :P
[02:11] <antarus> we use debmirror
[02:11] <antarus> its also crap
[02:11] <antarus> ;p
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> well apt-mirror just failed  because of lag
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> so...
[02:11]  * TheLordOfTime fixed that
[02:17] <antarus> although it comes ot mind that we might just do something stupid
[02:17] <antarus> isn't /bin/sh dash on Ubuntu?
[02:17] <TheLordOfTime> thought it was just 'sh'
[02:17]  * TheLordOfTime loads up a VM
[02:18] <TheLordOfTime> root@luna:/bin# ls -alshF sh
[02:18] <TheLordOfTime> 0 lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 4 Mar 29  2012 sh -> dash*
[02:18] <TheLordOfTime> i'm wrong :P
[02:18] <TheLordOfTime> it is dash
[02:18] <TheLordOfTime> (symlink?)
[02:19] <antarus> yeah
[02:19] <antarus> we symlink it to bash for some reason
[02:19] <TheLordOfTime> s/bash/dash/
[02:19] <TheLordOfTime> that's on Precise
[02:19] <antarus> right
[02:19] <antarus> we == work
[02:19]  * TheLordOfTime points at Luna, then at a 12.04 CD
[02:19] <antarus> at work we symlink it to bash
[02:19] <antarus> probably because it was the cool thing to do 7 years ago ;p
[02:20] <antarus> which would explain why only we are seeing these weird lightdm issues
[02:20] <antarus> I'll go in tomorrow and see if replacing bash with dash 'fixes' it
[02:20]  * antarus grumbles
[02:20] <TheLordOfTime> so... pebkac?  :P
[02:20] <antarus> meh
[02:21] <TheLordOfTime> hehe i kid.
[02:21] <epikvision> Hello, is anyone here participating in the hug day?
[02:21] <antarus> we call these bugs based on 'historical purposes'
[02:21] <TheLordOfTime> epikvision, its almost the end of the day, i could have sworn a bunch were already participating
[02:21] <antarus> because we didn't write down why we did X, but we have the commit that did it
[02:21] <TheLordOfTime> but i wasn't here, i was busy so...
[02:21] <antarus> so we spend hours trying to puzzle out why ;)
[02:22] <epikvision> well, I just returned from school, and I'm just about to start.  I'm having trouble though in using hugday-tools.  I branched it, but bash doesn't recognize "hugday" as a command.
[02:23] <TheLordOfTime> this is why i just triage normally :P
[02:23] <TheLordOfTime> epikvision, afaiui transmission's the focus
[02:23] <TheLordOfTime> there's quite a bit of segv bugs though, so...
[02:26] <epikvision> TheLordOfTime, I would do it normally, but I also want to try out the tools.  How can I install the tools with the setup.py file?
[02:26] <TheLordOfTime> epikvision, i don't use the tools, so i couldn't tell you :P
[02:28] <epikvision> Ok, I figured it was: python setup.py install
[02:28] <chilicuil> it seems the ubuntu bug day was a success, all bugs listed were touched =)
[02:28] <TheLordOfTime> there should be a readme, no epikvision? :P
[02:29] <epikvision> chilicuil, so bug day is finished? :-(
[02:29] <TheLordOfTime> i'm still here
[02:29] <TheLordOfTime> if you have something you want me to look at lemme kno0w
[02:29] <TheLordOfTime> otherwise, i'm going to be hacking away at php5's source code
[02:30] <epikvision> there is, but it didn't explain installation.
[02:30] <TheLordOfTime> is there an 'INSTALL' file? :P
[02:31] <chilicuil> epikvision: I'd say yes, but there are still a bunch of reports in other pkgs waiting for us, I'll do a little bit of triaging work now
[02:31] <TheLordOfTime> yepo
[02:31] <TheLordOfTime> yep *
[02:31] <epikvision> just a setup.py file, but at least I installed it.
[02:31] <TheLordOfTime> i'm highly specialized into server packages, but i'm here if needed, so ;P
[02:31]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[02:32] <epikvision> chilicuil, yeah, I'm going to start triaging too.
[02:37] <epikvision> when triaging bugs, is it necessary to have the same desktop version?
[02:37] <epikvision> to confirm the bug?
[02:38] <TheLordOfTime> epikvision, do you mean same desktop environment?
[02:38] <epikvision> Because I'm going to do triaging on my 12.04.1 stable machine. Don't know if I have to be using development build...
[02:38] <epikvision> yes
[02:38] <TheLordOfTime> rather than destop "version"
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> epikvision, if something is filed against precise, confirm using precise
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> and check quantal / raring
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> unless someone already said "Quantal / Raring / $release is not affected."
[02:58] <epikvision> anyone using hugday tools? I need some assistance.  How do I identify MOINID?
[03:12] <epikvision> It seems that most of the bugs for today have been triaged. https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/transmission
[03:13] <TheLordOfTime> yup
[03:14] <epikvision> oh well, I will just get to other bugs then.
[06:10] <om26er> cool, we had 71 NEW bugs when we started now they are 3
[06:10]  * TheLordOfTime goes back to stabbing oidentd's packaging
[06:10] <TheLordOfTime> is it weird when it says that the debian tarball modifies upstream changes?
[06:11] <TheLordOfTime> s/changes/files/
[06:11] <TheLordOfTime> (where "debian tarball"  is the .debian.tar.gz)
[10:19] <Zilvador> Has the package ubuntu-qa-tools been taken out of universe?
[10:27] <jibel> Zilvador, yes, it has been removed in Natty IIRC but it is still maintained in LP https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-qa-tools
[10:29] <Zilvador> jibel, apparently the lastest package is for Natty there too. Can it be installed in Quantal or is there a replacement?
[10:35] <jibel> Zilvador, which tools are you interested in? There is a package here https://launchpad.net/~utah/+archive/daily/+packages but it only contains vm-tools and dl-ubuntu-test-iso
[10:35] <jibel> otherwise most of the tools are runnable from the source tree
[10:36] <Zilvador> jibel, I was just thinking of the tools on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/Tools
[10:37] <Zilvador> Or more generally to find out which tools there are.
[10:42] <jibel> oh, it's really old stuff, there is no package that I know. I don't even know if hugday in particular still works on latest releases
[10:42] <Zilvador> jibel, I see. Then I will just skip it. Maybe the wiki page should be removed then?
[10:46] <jibel> Zilvador, hugday from https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu-qa-tools works fine on raring, so it just needs a volunteer to give it some love and maintain a package :)
[10:47] <Zilvador> jibel, sounds good :). Can I update the wiki page with this information?
[10:49] <jibel> Zilvador, of course, it's a public wiki

[16:30] <iBelieve> I've been working on a bug for a long time and haven't been able to fix it, so I just unassigned myself from it. However, I can't set the status from "In progress" back to "Triaged". Is that what I'm supposed to do, or what am I supposed to do?
[16:43] <roadmr> iBelieve: if you're no longer actively working on it, Triaged sounds better
[16:43] <roadmr> iBelieve: if you like I can help set it to that, just give me the bug number
