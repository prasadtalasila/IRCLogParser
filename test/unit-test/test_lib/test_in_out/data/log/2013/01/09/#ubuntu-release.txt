[15:27] <rtg> who is processing the raring NEW queue these days? I'd like to get the nvidia packages accepted so that I can upload a 3.8 kernel (upon which subsequent nvidia changes are dependent)
[15:28] <ogra_> rtg, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ArchiveAdministration#Archive_days
[15:29] <cjwatson> I'm looking at the nvidia packages at the moment
[15:29] <rtg> thanks
[15:29] <cjwatson> following a request from tseliot earlier which I forgot to reply to
[15:29] <cjwatson> bear with me though as I'm not really familiar with these packages ...
[15:30] <rtg> s'alright. we're not likely gonna upload a kernel until tomorrow.
[15:31]  * cjwatson decides the solution is to diff against nvidia-current-updates
[15:34] <cjwatson> tseliot,rtg: done (source, anyway), sorry for the delay
[15:34] <rtg> no problem, thanks.
[15:34] <tseliot> cjwatson: thanks

[22:01] <phillw> cjwatson: or any others on here... sorry to ask. AFAIK, mini-iso is dropped in at what ever point debian do it, is ubuntu-server iso with no bits added suitable to have any DE added to it? (e.g. Ubuntu, lubuntu, kubuntu, xubuntu)
[22:02] <knome> sounds like something i'm interested in as well.
[22:02] <xnox> your question doesn't quite make sense.
[22:02] <xnox> Debian dropped business-card cds.
[22:03] <xnox> the installer is still the same in debian (debian-installer).
[22:03] <xnox> And in ubuntu we still have pxeboot & mini cds which bring up tasksel and it's possible to install ubuntu-desktop, kubuntu-desktop etc.
[22:04] <xnox> I am not entirely sure if we do or don't have l/x-ubuntu tasksel options, if we don't it's a bug.
[22:04] <xnox> grab an iso from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[22:04] <xnox> boot it and see what it offers to install.
[22:04] <knome> i suppose my question is if the minimal iso will still be around
[22:05] <xnox> yes, it will.
[22:05] <xnox> it was one of the conditions when we dropped alternate cds.
[22:05] <xnox> for d-i, the options are server or mini cds.
[22:06] <xnox> phillw: can you point me where you see that debian is dropping mini-iso?!
[22:09] <xnox> debian still has the netinst & pxeboot images, cd/dvd/blueray
[22:10] <xnox> oh and live.
[22:10] <phillw> xnox: can we chat on -quality, thanks
[22:24] <xnox> end results, just because testdrive package doesn't know about mini.iso URLs, it doesn't mean they do not exist =))))))
