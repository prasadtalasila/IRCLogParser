[01:20] <JoseeAntonioR> hey guys, can I get some upvotes? :) http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/15ss8i/jono_bacon_qa/
[08:59] <popey> morning
[09:03] <czajkowski> aloha
[10:23] <philipballew> hello ubuntuers
[10:30] <popey> lo
[10:34] <philipballew> say popey what you think we do on the G+ page when people ask mint and other ubuntu derivatives questions. Seen a lot lately?
[10:35] <philipballew> Ive been letting them go, as I was busy deleting credit card app and Nigerian prince type posts
[10:36] <popey> I honestly don't know what to do about support on G+
[10:37] <czajkowski> philipballew: perhaps point them at the other derivatives G+ pages
[10:38] <czajkowski> I get lots of non LP questions re Ubuntu and derivitiaves I try where possble to find the pages they are looking for or where they will get help
[10:38] <czajkowski> I get a *lot* of support questions via Fb for Launchpad
[10:38] <philipballew> Not a bad idea
[10:39] <czajkowski> and I just reply not here and point them at the answers page on LP which seems to be helping
[10:40] <philipballew> Sometimes I wonder why people use the group pages like that as ways to get help. Forms and StackExchange are so much better.
[10:40]  * philipballew needs to get more Launchpad stickers
[10:40] <czajkowski> philipballew: I tend to questions peoplss logic on these things
[10:41] <czajkowski> hmm not sure we have any more launchpad stickets
[10:41] <czajkowski> stickers
[10:41] <czajkowski> I'll be in the office this week and have a look and if I find any will post you them
[10:41] <philipballew> oh tight!
[10:41] <philipballew> tight = cool for anyone who is unaware.
[10:41] <czajkowski> philipballew: do you surf?
[10:42] <czajkowski> feckin' hell G+ is a bit cranky today with some posts already before the annoucement is out
[10:42] <philipballew> Ive surfed a few times, however I am way to clumsy to do it good though.
[10:42] <czajkowski> I just hae visions of you as a surfer shouting DUDE! AWESOME TIGHT!
[10:42] <philipballew> I live right next to the ocean http://danperkins.blogs.com/doxa/images/2008/03/14/goodwin_hall_2.jpg
[10:43] <czajkowski> nice
[10:43] <czajkowski> I miss being close to the ocean over here
[10:43] <czajkowski> but othe rhalf has a new car arriving this week so hopefully more trips
[10:43] <philipballew> I need to attempt to become a more sterotypical Californian
[10:43] <philipballew> Oh nice, what kind?
[10:44] <czajkowski> BMW 320d
[10:45] <philipballew> Oh, nice! Driving in style!
[10:45] <czajkowski> and I'll be insured on it :)
[10:45] <czajkowski> so more trips to the sea :D
[10:45] <philipballew> One day I'll need to come to see London.
[10:45] <czajkowski> dear  UPS dude hurry up and collect Sheldon so it comes back sooner!
[10:46] <popey> czajkowski: what posts?
[10:46] <philipballew> Sometimes you cant trust the ups
[10:46] <czajkowski> popey: Jans and jonos
[10:46] <czajkowski> and my twitter stream is a bit cranky as well
[10:46] <czajkowski> people should just chill and wait and see
[10:47] <czajkowski> philipballew: Toshiba arranged them
[10:47] <czajkowski> am using my old laptop, and forgot how slow it was
[10:47]  * philipballew always uses USPS and knows that means nothing to anyone in Europe.
[10:47] <popey> oh Jan.. yes..
[10:48] <czajkowski> philipballew: aye we'd know of it
[10:49] <philipballew> One of the few good things of America.
[10:51] <AlanBell> popey: are there going to be people on IRC anywhere later who have a clue what is going on and can answer questions after the announcement?
[10:53] <popey> AlanBell: jono is doing a QA about it at 6:30 UK time
[10:53] <popey> and #ubuntu-on-air
[10:53] <philipballew> http://joseeantonior.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/jono-bacon-on-air-qa/
[10:54] <philipballew> I think thats the right link
[10:54] <czajkowski> ah on air :(
[10:54] <czajkowski> why not regualr irc for folks that cant join in but can read a log
[10:54] <czajkowski> :(
[10:55] <philipballew> because videos are "cool and hip"
[10:55] <czajkowski> meh
[10:56] <czajkowski> I disaree but I'm in the minoroty there I know that
[10:56] <czajkowski> *minority
[10:56] <Tm_T> czajkowski: I btw agree on that "point to right support direction" as that would be the ubuntu way to do (:
[10:56] <philipballew> yeah, I wonder if there is a way to say pull what he says and transcribe it. Like make subtitles and make a log of that.
[10:57] <philipballew> ^is not thinking that should be done, and does not hope someone reads that and thinks he knows anything about how to do that.
[10:57] <czajkowski> heh
[10:59] <philipballew> czajkowski, cant you just listen to the video when you work or something?
[11:00] <czajkowski> philipballew: I can yes, but others can't due to work /travel/bandwith
[11:00] <czajkowski> it's not very inclusive to many people
[11:00] <Tm_T> philipballew: atleast I cannot listen something while working, listening is for me something that requires full attention
[11:01] <Tm_T> well, I can listen music, but just as background noise /:
[11:01] <popey> czajkowski: why can't people join in?
[11:01] <philipballew> everyone is different I guess. For some it might be easier to listen to it when your working where reading means you have to stop work.
[11:01] <czajkowski> popey: bandwith/travel/not a good time so many read logs if on irc afterwards.
[11:01] <czajkowski> or for some their 1st language isn't english and cant listen as fast
[11:01] <popey> it is archived so people can watch later
[11:02] <czajkowski> so prefer to read so it's translates.
[11:02] <popey> and anyone can transcribe it
[11:02] <czajkowski> liek I said, I'm in the minority club :)
[11:02] <czajkowski> *like
[11:02] <philipballew> Tm_T, I assume the music is released under an open source approved license right?
[11:02] <czajkowski> lordie I cannot type today!
[11:02] <popey> I'm just asking so we can find a solution
[11:03] <popey> transcription is a possibility
[11:03]  * philipballew hopes Tm_T did not take that seriously
[11:03] <popey> happy to have a google doc open at the time and we could do multi-player editing to capture it all
[11:04] <czajkowski> nods
[11:04] <czajkowski> nice idea
[11:04] <philipballew> could that be done automatically though?
[11:05] <Tm_T> philipballew: I currently have game soundtrack playing, no idea about the license as it doesn't have one accompanied with the contents AFAICS
[11:05]  * philipballew has Rap playing
[11:05]  * czajkowski always has music on 
[11:05] <philipballew> ^probably made is OSX
[11:07] <popey> philipballew: not without paying someone to do it I dont think
[11:07] <Tm_T> aah, "all rights reserved" says http://benprunty.bandcamp.com/
[11:08] <philipballew> popey, ah, everything I want to do has not been invented yet. Automatic subtitles is now one of them.
[11:08] <philipballew> Tm_T, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop_Rock
[11:12] <AlanBell> JoseeAntonioR: broken link on your blog post
[11:12] <AlanBell> goes to http://joseeantonior.wordpress.com/2013/01/01/jono-bacon-on-air-qa/www.ubuntuonair.com
[11:13] <AlanBell> you need the http:// on the front of it
[13:16] <JoseeAntonioR> AlanBell: thanks, will change in a sec
[13:50] <AskUbuntu> Why is Unity named Unity | http://askubuntu.com/q/235224
[13:58] <jcastro> popey: you know, if we ever get time, we should get chris mason on an onair
[13:59] <jcastro> popey: or perhaps you guys could have him call in on uupc
[13:59] <popey> good idea!
[14:05] <cjohnston> mornin
[14:05] <jcastro> omg
[14:06] <jcastro> in like 4 hours we get to do something
[14:06] <mhall119> \o/

[14:07] <mhall119> god I hope so
[14:07] <cjohnston> Sounds good to me
[14:08] <czajkowski> popey: you may want to book mark this https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays
[14:10] <popey> czajkowski: i have a google calendar for that ☺
[14:11] <czajkowski> ah ok I ws putting mine into admin for the coming months
[14:15] <jcastro> popey: I learned something over the break
[14:15] <jcastro> removing someone's post just removes it from the community page
[14:15] <jcastro> so the person's post and comments and stuff are intact
[14:16] <jcastro> so you don't need to feel bad about destroying something, because everything is preserved, it's just not on the community page
[14:18] <jcastro> http://www.damnocrazy.com/21/canonical-announces-upad-tablet-running-ubuntu
[14:18] <popey> yeah, i noticed that too
[14:19] <popey> when I removed the post from the guy asking debian people to come and troll us
[14:19] <popey> people carried on commenting on it
[14:38] <jcastro> technoviking: around?
[15:41] <bkerensa> mhall119: If you have time we would love to have you join the OMG On Air Event this morning
[15:41] <jcastro> heya balloons
[15:41] <jcastro> http://reports.qa.ubuntu.com/smoke/raring/
[15:41] <jcastro> what does the orange dot mean in the errors column?
[15:41] <balloons> mhmmm
[15:41] <mhall119> bkerensa: You'd love it even more if I had things ready for this announcement ;)
[15:42] <popey> hah
[15:42] <bkerensa> mhall119: :) We got joey for that
[15:42] <bkerensa> mhall119: he has a mobile broadband kit :)
[15:42] <mhall119> bkerensa: I meant being ready on our end
[15:42] <bkerensa> mhall119: oh
[15:42] <bkerensa> :)
[15:43] <bkerensa> mhall119: I'm sure popey is ready :)
[15:43] <popey> ofc
[15:43] <popey> ready for what?
[15:43] <popey> ☺
[15:43] <bkerensa> lawl
[15:43] <bkerensa> what is this nonsense http://www.damnocrazy.com/21/canonical-announces-upad-tablet-running-ubuntu
[15:43] <bkerensa> ?
[15:43] <bkerensa> people believe that?
[15:43] <mhall119> does popey even have anything to do for it today?
[15:44] <bkerensa> mhall119: I'm sure he has more to do with it than community team but thats speculation at best :P
[15:44] <jcastro> I love that it's $999 and like 2 people already complained about the price
[15:44] <bkerensa> :)
[15:44] <bkerensa> $999 from a Chinese OEM hah
[15:44] <balloons> lol, that link
[15:44] <balloons> jcastro, umm, not sure actually
[15:44] <popey> that site is made by the guy who runs muktware
[15:45] <balloons> it means a specific error..
[15:45] <Pici> That link had half the people in -offtopic convinced *rolleyes*
[15:45] <bkerensa> now that I think about it.... does China have any OEM's or is it just American and Japanese OEM's that use China for labor?
[15:45] <balloons> I believe it means something completely failed
[15:45] <popey> mostly chinese and taiwanese
[15:45] <balloons> make sense?
[15:46] <jcastro> popey: the difference is it's hard to tell which site is real and which isn't. :p
[15:46] <popey> i did point that out to him
[15:46] <popey> https://plus.google.com/108348326565536851746/posts/KeGNrQEo1QG
[15:46] <jcastro> balloons: I think so, I'd just never seen a purple canonical logo before
[15:48]  * balloons notes it looks orange
[15:49] <bkerensa> jcastro: remember this one http://www.netbooknews.com/wp-content/2010/10/Canonical-Cloud-1.jpg
[15:49] <jcastro> hah yeah
[15:49] <czajkowski> I have that sign here
[15:49] <czajkowski> got it when the office was moving
[15:49] <czajkowski> it used t hang on one of the doors :)

[15:56] <bkerensa> jono: will this be retailing at the dollar tree or perhaps a high end retailer? :)
[15:56] <jono> haha
[15:56] <Pici> from the footer: "This page is a joke, do not take seriously or in combination with any other medication."
[15:57] <bkerensa> Pici: clearly :) it was a meme someone made on G+ last night
[15:57] <jcastro> man

[15:58] <jcastro> why is this so funny
[15:58] <jono> haha
[15:58] <cjohnston> lol
[15:58] <jcastro> it shouldn't be ... but the rhythm of the bobble ...
[15:58] <jcastro> it's like ... mesmerizing

[16:00] <balloons> nice
[16:00] <jcastro> cool cool
[16:00] <jcastro> what he really means is
[16:01] <jcastro> "I can't really use my keyboard until my head stops bobbling around"
[16:01] <balloons> hehe.. it's been over 24 hours
[16:02] <bkerensa> jono: what do you mean :) thats advocacy right there man
[16:02] <bkerensa> ;p

[16:05] <JoseeAntonioR> bkerensa: ack'd
[16:08] <jono> :-)
[16:09] <jcastro> am I the only one who saw their todo list today and was like "I don't even know what half of this stuff means"
[16:10] <Pici> Nope.  I've been on vacation since Christmas and I now I have to do all these works things I forgot about.
[16:11] <pleia2> I am unemployed \o/
[16:11] <pleia2> (only for a week though :))
[16:11] <jcastro> where you going?
[16:11] <pleia2> HP, get to work on the openstack ci team <3
[16:12] <Pici> nice!
[16:12] <Pici> Congrats :)
[16:12] <pleia2> thanks :)
[16:14] <snap-l> pleia2: That's awesome. I'm sure you'll make great things there.
[16:14] <pleia2> snap-l: thanks!
[16:16] <jcastro> pleia2: what?! that's freaking awesome!
[16:16] <pleia2> jcastro: yes! I'm very excited
[16:17] <mhall119> pleia2: \o/ congrats!
[16:17] <pleia2> was looking for something sysadmin+open source, found it :)
[16:17] <mhall119> now jcastro won't ever leave you alone about juju stuff
[16:17] <pleia2> lol
[16:17] <vibhav> http://socloseyoucanalmostbobbleit.com/
[16:17] <jcastro> that's like 2+ more conferences a year if you go to ODS!
[16:18] <pleia2> yeah, at least
[16:18] <vibhav> This is the most amazing website, EVAR
[16:20] <bkerensa> JoseeAntonioR: post is live on omg
[16:20] <jono> pleia2, congrats!
[16:20] <jcastro> pleia2: clint and robert collins are over there too
[16:20] <jcastro> HP has been picking up a bunch of ubuntu expertise lately
[16:20] <pleia2> jcastro: yeah, I interviewed with lifeless, cody-somerville just jined too
[16:20] <bkerensa> jcastro: clint byrum?
[16:20] <pleia2> joined too
[16:20] <bkerensa> O.o
[16:21] <jcastro> bkerensa: yeah
[16:21] <czajkowski> lifeless is amazing to work with
[16:21] <bkerensa> wat
[16:21] <JoseeAntonioR> bkerensa: looks good, thanks!
[16:21] <bkerensa> jcastro: you guys let clint go?
[16:21] <jcastro> bkerensa: like a month ago, it was on his blog
[16:21] <bkerensa> =/
[16:21] <bkerensa> no
[16:21] <popey> chris jones is there too iirc
[16:21] <bkerensa> jcastro: will he still hack on juju?
[16:21] <jcastro> I didn't let clint go, he has his own hopes and dreams and is in charge of his own destiny.
[16:21] <jcastro> bkerensa: more openstacky stuff core probably, he's still around though
[16:22] <pleia2> both Landscape Canonical guys I met at LISA '12 last month were at HP before, so I think there is a fair amount of trading happening :)
[16:22] <mhall119> bkerensa: also, you know how good those hackers are at lock-picking, we can't keep them captive forever
[16:22] <jcastro> clint had a choice between jorge and openstack. I lost. :(
[16:22] <mhall119> :(
[16:23] <jcastro> ODS is an awesome conference though, I think I'll actually end up seeing him more
[16:23] <bkerensa> mhall119: but you have root
[16:23] <bkerensa> :D
[16:23] <mhall119> bkerensa: not me
[16:24] <mhall119> no way would ubuntu devs trust me with root
[16:24] <vibhav> It's sabdfl
[16:24] <jcastro> bkerensa: hey did they find out the problem on omg over the break? the db was borked or something?
[16:24] <bkerensa> jcastro: pm
[16:24] <pleia2> I hear the next ODS is landing on Ubuntu release week, I'll be going to at least part of it (have to be in philly by thursday though, for the whole getting married thing)
[16:24] <dpm> Hey all
[16:27] <JoseeAntonioR> hey, dpm
[16:27] <jcastro> pleia2: dang, you're full of good news today!
[16:28] <pleia2> haha, been engaged for over a year, time to pull the trigger :)
[16:28] <jono> hey dpm
[16:31] <technoviking> jcastro: hi
[16:32] <jcastro> technoviking: heya
[16:32] <jcastro> technoviking: hey so what's the tldr on the forum upgrade? the last few messages make no sense to me
[16:33] <technoviking> I honestly do not, ask the FC if they heard from IS when we want to work on it, no response from them.
[16:34] <jcastro> ok
[16:34] <technoviking> last I heard, IS wanted to do a upgrade test, then make the forums read only for a couple days to do the upgrade
[16:34] <jcastro> I'll poke
[16:35] <technoviking> I assume someone his the LP plugin for vB4? I think it is working about never seen the bzr to the plugin.
[16:36] <pleia2> the plugin was provided back in October
[16:36] <jcastro> lp:vbulletin-launchpad-integration
[16:36] <jcastro> is where it lives
[16:36] <technoviking> when can I order my BBH (Bacon Booble-Head) before the rush :)
[16:37] <jono> technoviking, lol
[16:37] <jono> now there is an acronym
[16:37] <jono> BBH sounds like some kind of forum markup language
[16:37] <jono> lol
[16:37] <jcastro> sounds like a good name for your own bbq sauce.
[16:37] <jcastro> make it happen
[16:38] <popey> NO! Don't make him talk about BBQs!
[16:38] <jcastro> "Spice up your chicken with some hardcore BBH, made by hand with the bones of crushed dreams."
[16:38] <popey> Although.. Jokosher sauce...
[16:38] <jcastro> ... sounds disgusting
[16:39] <jcastro> I am || close to finishing off my dry rub recipe. For this summer. \o/
[16:39] <technoviking> Severed Fifth Death Sauce
[16:40] <technoviking> my grill is buried under 2 feet of snow, no grilling for the foreseeable future :(
[16:42] <jcastro> I don't even have a grill yet, and if it was, it'd be buried in snow
[16:43] <vibhav> jono : ping
[16:46] <jono> hey vibhav
[16:46] <jono> jcastro, I am gonna start making my own sauce in the next few weeks
[16:47] <jono> got a DVD at Christmas that got me started :-)
[16:47] <vibhav> jono : any plans for an IRC channel during the product launch?
[16:47] <jono> vibhav, no current plans, but good idea
[16:47] <jono> how about #ubuntu-launch
[16:47] <vibhav> Sounds good
[16:47] <pleia2> isn't this the sort of thing #ubuntu-discuss was created for?
[16:47] <popey> why not #ubuntu-discuss...
[16:47] <popey> ^5
[16:48] <pleia2> ^5
[16:48] <jcastro> jono: yeah, I have been looking for sources for ingredients, that seems to be like 90% of the work
[16:48] <vibhav> Ah, I forgot that
[16:48] <jono> #ubuntu-discuss sounds good
[16:48] <jono> jcastro, you making a sauce?
[16:49] <bkerensa> jono: people are excited you will be popping in
[16:49] <bkerensa> :D
[16:49] <jono> bkerensa, :-)
[16:49] <vibhav> Heh
[16:49] <bkerensa> jono: I think they want to hear about this bobble head :D
[16:49] <jono> lol
[16:49] <jcastro> jono: no, dry rub/seasoning.
[16:50] <vibhav> jono : spread the Hangout/IRC channel on the Ubuntu social media channels. That should do it
[16:51] <vibhav> Channel word*
[16:51] <jono> jcastro, man, rubs are hard to make
[16:51] <jono> jcastro, for Christmas Erica bought me every Myron Mixon rub he does so I can play with them
[16:51] <jono> he is the guy from BBQ Pitmasters :-)
[16:51] <daker> if you haven't see what i captured :D https://plus.google.com/u/0/101694416703170881163/posts/H49guzJSf9A

[16:52] <jcastro> jono: mine is my grandmas recipe, it's more something like lowry's salt mix, something you want to sprinkle on your meat when you don't have time to mix something
[16:52] <daker> jono: it was on ubuntu.com for a few seconds :D
[16:52] <jcastro> basically, a good ootb seasoning, nothing like special or anything
[16:52] <jono> jcastro, oh nice, I love family recipes, make all the difference
[16:52] <jcastro> yeah.
[16:52] <jono> not all that much BBQ in the Bacon family though, lol
[16:53] <jono> daker, what was?
[16:53] <JoseeAntonioR> the bobble thingy
[16:53] <vibhav> I am sure that landuke is behind the bobble website
[16:53] <daker> what have you seen on the capture
[16:53] <jono> it wasnt, surely?
[16:53] <popey> vibhav: thats not who owns the domain
[16:53] <daker> jono: it was on ubuntu.com
[16:53] <jono> daker, that is a mock site :-)
[16:54] <vibhav> popey : who owns the domain?
[16:54] <mhall119> I bet popey does
[16:54] <popey> vibhav: whois is your friend lazy man
[16:54] <vibhav> I'm here on a mobile
[16:54] <vibhav> :(
[16:54] <popey> whois.net
[16:54] <JoseeAntonioR> boom, it's private
[16:55] <jono> Alexander Wainwright
[16:55] <daker> ah :D
[16:55] <jono> ahh yeah
[17:03] <mhall119> bkerensa: how's the hangout going?
[17:04] <mhall119> or has it not started yet?
[17:04] <philipballew> I think it starts in like 45 minutes apparently.
[17:05] <bkerensa> mhall119: it has not yet started... setting up a firefox roll up for a backdrop in my office
[17:05] <bkerensa> :D
[17:05] <mhall119> bkerensa: as long as it doesn't cover your Ubuntu pictograms
[17:07] <JoseeAntonioR> bkerensa: do you have ubuntu pictograms too?
[17:07] <mhall119> someone did, I thought it was him
[17:07] <JoseeAntonioR> it was me
[17:07] <mhall119> I know he painted his office bright orange
[17:07] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: ah, ok
[17:07] <JoseeAntonioR> his office is a mix between firefox orange and ubuntu orange
[17:07] <mhall119> just like him
[17:08] <bkerensa> JoseeAntonioR: not yet... my office is not finished yet I need to do another coat of paint for it to have the shine I want and its winter so I cant now
[17:08] <bkerensa> :D
[17:09] <bkerensa> JoseeAntonioR: shall we?
[17:09] <JoseeAntonioR> huh?
[17:22] <SergioMeneses> morning!
[17:42] <mhall119> czajkowski: are we encouraging the use of #ubuntu-discuss to talk about the announcement?
[17:43] <popey> that would make sense
[17:46] <Pici> please
[17:46] <jcastro> popey: I am really happy to see this
[17:47] <jcastro> (not making another channel/list)
[17:47] <jcastro> good job
[17:48] <czajkowski> mhall119: eh why are you asked me :)
[17:48] <czajkowski> *asking
[17:49] <mhall119> czajkowski: I thought you mentioned something about it
[17:49] <czajkowski> Nooo
[17:56] <jono> bkerensa, where do I join the hangout?
[17:58] <jono> JoseeAntonioR, ^
[17:58] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: I'll give you the link
[17:58] <jono> thanks
[17:59] <pleia2> mhall119: that was me, not czajkowski ;) and I gave a heads up to the irc team that we'd be pointing people there
[18:00] <mhall119> pleia2: ok, I've been all over the map today, so pardon the confusion
[18:03] <cjohnston> imbrandon: omg is down
[18:03] <JoseeAntonioR> jcastro: ping, omg is down
[18:03] <jcastro> I don't run omg!
[18:03] <jcastro> and it works fine for me
[18:04] <jcastro> oh, now it's down
[18:04] <marcoceppi> JoseeAntonioR: you'll want to ping imbrandon
[18:04] <JoseeAntonioR> imbrandon: ^
[18:04] <marcoceppi> The Ubuntu homepage won't load for me
[18:05] <cjohnston> JoseeAntonioR: its now on ubuntu..com
[18:07] <snap-l> And ubuntu.com isn't loading
[18:07] <jcastro> omg seems up
[18:07] <JoseeAntonioR> jcastro: click on the first post
[18:08] <jcastro> it works for me now
[18:08] <jcastro> .. but back down
[18:08] <marcoceppi> My assumption, two web-heads. One is down
[18:12] <jo-erlend> alright; time's up. What's the big secret? :)
[18:13] <snap-l> jo-erlend: There's no U in Ubuntu
[18:14] <snap-l> ;)
[18:14] <jo-erlend> it's a Phone. :)
[18:14] <snap-l> We've been working on bnt all this time.
[18:15] <jo-erlend> I can tell from the image on /devices that it must be Ubuntu Phone.
[18:16] <jo-erlend> :)
[18:16] <jcastro> alas, my dream of ubuntu on toasters is dead.
[18:16] <jcastro> marcoceppi: hey, so, just in time for your webos phone to die
[18:18] <marcoceppi> jcastro: yeah, pretty good timing
[18:18] <marcoceppi> I just need to know where to throw my money
[18:19] <jcastro> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpWHJDLsqTU
[18:58] <inetpro> jono: the link in your article to go to developer phone page is incorrect at http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/01/02/announcing-ubuntu-for-phones/
[18:59] <inetpro> I'm guessing it should go to http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/ ?
[19:01] <inetpro> oh and I'm talking about the link in the paragraph starting with "If you have Qt/QML programming experience...."
[19:04] <SergioMeneses> inetpro, is working that link?.. I can see it
[19:05] <inetpro> SergioMeneses: it's fixed now
[19:05] <inetpro> thanks jono
[19:05] <jono> thanks!
[19:05] <inetpro> clearly the Ubuntu sites are very popular today
[19:06]  * inetpro would love to see some web stats
[19:08] <SergioMeneses> inetpro, perfect
[19:09] <SergioMeneses> hey hey jono \o always is nice to see you
[19:09] <jono> hey SergioMeneses :-)
[19:40] <Pici> mhall119: is #ubuntu-phone now the place we should be pointing people?  It would be nice to know since we are getting lots of questions about it in #ubuntu
[19:40] <mhall119> Pici: I think that would be best, it matches #ubuntu-tv
=== scott-work_ is now known as scott-work
[21:24] <jcastro> mhall119: jono: where should incoming phone questions be tagged on AU, I'm assuming "mobile"?
[21:25] <jono> jcastro, yeah, mobile
[21:25] <mhall119> jcastro: yes
[21:26] <mhall119> guess I should monitor AU too
[21:26] <jcastro> if you can submit some fixes here pointing to the official resources that would be <3: http://askubuntu.com/tags/mobile/info
[21:29] <jcastro> it's not obvious the tag is for generic mobile stuff
[21:32] <mhall119> jcastro: added some links
[22:11] <daker> it seems that the toolkit is only for 12.10, no 12.04 :(
