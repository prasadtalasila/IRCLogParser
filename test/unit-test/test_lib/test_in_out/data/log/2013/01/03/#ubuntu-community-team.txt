[00:25] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: ping
[00:25] <jono> hey JoseeAntonioR
[00:27] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: hey, tomorrow I'll be starting the hangout 10-15 mins before to set everything up, to confirm the stream starts at 10:30 your time
[00:28] <jono> thanks so much JoseeAntonioR
[00:28] <jono> man, you rock!
[00:28] <JoseeAntonioR> :)
[00:51] <daker> After France now Qatar is coming to the USA http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/al-jazeera-said-to-be-acquiring-current-tv/
[02:04] <mhall119> I've seen articles about the ubuntu phone on at least two "What's hot" promoted articles on G+, which means we're reaching people who don't even follow Ubuntu stuff
[02:22] <bkerensa> mhall119: CNN bashed the platform pretty hard
[02:34] <philipballew> http://money.cnn.com/2013/01/02/technology/mobile/ubuntu-smartphone-linux/
[02:45] <jcastro> meh
[02:45] <jcastro> that's like "why is apple even trying, everyone is using blackberries and symbian."
[02:45] <jcastro> "why is google trying everyone is using iphones."
[03:02] <bkerensa> jcastro: everyone is not using iphones :) Android outsells iPhone 5 to 2
[03:02] <bkerensa> jcastro: and it doesn't matter what a finance writer for CNN says imho
[03:02] <bkerensa> :)
[03:06] <jcastro> bkerensa: at the time when android launched iphone was already entrenched
[03:06] <jcastro> and it passed it
[03:06] <jcastro> that's my entire point
[03:06] <jcastro> it's like people saying "why bother, we have iphone and android" totally forget that not that long ago it was blackberry and symbian; and that changed relatively quickly.
[03:11] <mhall119> jcastro: bkerensa: Remember the early reactions to the iPod?
[03:11] <bkerensa> mhall119: yes
[03:11] <bkerensa> mhall119: Im not suggesting Ubuntu Phone is disadvantaged
[03:11] <bkerensa> I just think the situation is unique in those cases
[03:11] <bkerensa> Google had billions it made of search
[03:12] <bkerensa> thats how it defeated Apple and Blackberry and continues to smack down Windows Phone
[03:12] <jcastro> I don't think it's a zero sum game
[03:12] <jcastro> I wouldn't call any of those things "defeated"
[03:12] <bkerensa> Nexus 7 is a success... It sold for $199 and they give you $50 back in credit towards apps... its loss leading
[03:12] <bkerensa> So in reality
[03:12] <bkerensa> google loses on every Nexus 7 that sells
[03:12] <mhall119> bkerensa: the article wasn't that bad,really
[03:13] <bkerensa> mhall119: the headline was
[03:14] <mhall119> bkerensa: Apple makes their own Hardware, so OEMs are locked out of that.  Google now owns a phone manufacturer, so they're competing with other OEMs.  Microsoft has only had Nokia so far, and is also entering the hardware business with Surface.  If you're an OEM without your own OS right now, you're probably looking for other options
[03:14] <bkerensa> Nokia is dying
[03:14] <mhall119> probably
[03:14] <bkerensa> Samsung and HTC are locked in to Google
[03:14] <bkerensa> Apple owns Foxconn and China
[03:15] <bkerensa> so what does that leave?
[03:15] <mhall119> locked in?  I don't think so
[03:15] <bkerensa> pff
[03:15] <bkerensa> Samsung and HTC are making a fortune on Android
[03:15] <mhall119> Right now Google needs Samsung as much as Samsung needs google
[03:15] <mhall119> Android is only at the top of the market because of Samsung
[03:15] <mhall119> looks at handset sales
[03:16] <mhall119> Samsung has been given a lot of preference by Google so far
[03:16] <mhall119> but now Google has their own hardware division that they paid a fair bit of money for
[03:16] <mhall119> I'm betting they're going to use it
[03:16] <jcastro> any idea how the lock screen works?
[03:16] <jcastro> he mentioned it doesn't lock
[03:16] <mhall119> jcastro: according to the video, it's not a lock screen
[03:16] <jcastro> but like, that can't be right
[03:16] <mhall119> why?
[03:17] <jcastro> well, how do you lock your phone then?
[03:17] <mhall119> you don't
[03:17] <jcastro> that's the first thing my wife said when she saw that part.
[03:17] <jcastro> "so anyone can see my facebook?"
[03:17] <mhall119> my DroidX's "lock" screen just takes a swipe to unlock
[03:17] <jcastro> mine has a pin
[03:18] <mhall119> not mine
[03:18] <mhall119> I don't think iPhones do either
[03:18] <mhall119> at least, not by default
[03:18] <jcastro> oh ok
[03:18] <mhall119> maybe someone will make a 3rd party lock screen
[03:18] <jcastro> well as long as we can lock it then fine
[03:18] <mhall119> it's "locked" in the sense that you can't do anything with a tap
[03:19] <mhall119> but unlike my current phone, where a swipe unlocks it and only then can I get to something
[03:19] <mhall119> on this, a swipe "unlocks" it *and* gets me what I wanted, with one gesture
[03:19] <mhall119> it's not secure, no
[03:20] <mhall119> but it's no less secure that what most phones have
[03:20] <jcastro> well I'm sure there will be some locking functionality in there
[03:20] <mhall119> most likely
[03:21] <jcastro> that's one nice thing I saw on the surface
[03:21] <mhall119> I'm sure someone will invent multi-factor auth using the camera, gps and accelerometers
[03:21] <jcastro> the lock screen is any picture you choose
[03:21] <jcastro> and the "code" is your own gesture on top of that pic
[03:21] <mhall119> face north, jump twice, then cross your eyes
[03:21] <jcastro> so like, you can circle certain people's heads or do whatever
[03:22] <mhall119> jcastro: like on Windows 8?
[03:22] <mhall119> oh, "saw on the surface", duh
[03:22] <mhall119> yeah, that was a neat idea
[03:22] <mhall119> man, we are all over the media on this one
[03:23]  * mhall119 tips his hat to the marketing team
[03:24] <jcastro> the indicators are the best part
[03:24] <jcastro> that's really unique
[03:24] <jcastro> and makes total sense in hindsight
[03:29] <popey> the welcome screen is gorgeous
[03:29] <popey> and very personal
[03:29] <popey> so shows maybe number of tweets per day you sent, or number of emails per day, or some other thing unique to you
[03:29] <popey> I'm sure someone will make a lock app, maybe we will, but initially the welcome screen is the design we're showing at CES
[03:29] <jcastro> "number of mailing lists you closed this month"
[03:29] <popey> :D
[03:30] <popey> if it can be programmatically discovered, it can be a source for the welcome screen
[03:30] <jcastro> oh nice
[03:30] <popey> http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone/design
[03:30] <jcastro> and the round circle thing
[03:30] <popey> see the bit "a phone you can see yourself in"
[03:30] <popey> yes
[03:30] <jcastro> what does that represent
[03:30] <popey> days of the month
[03:30] <popey> hours of the day
[03:30] <popey> whatever
[03:31] <popey> its somewhat abstract
[03:31] <jcastro> ah
[03:31] <popey> pretty
[03:31] <jcastro> and the blobby colored circle things
[03:31] <jcastro> probably generated from my data?
[03:31] <popey> yes, excactly
[03:31] <popey> the blobs are relative based on the results
[03:31] <jcastro> nod
[03:31] <popey> so 3 tweets = small blob, 100 tweets, big one
[03:31] <jcastro> oh cool, "3 km walked"
[03:32] <popey> one of the videos i saw, verge I think, didn't demo the pull down notifications well
[03:32] <popey> he kinda implied you had to be spot on target to pull them down
[03:32] <popey> but you don't
[03:32] <jcastro> I love the made up names for otto and ivanka
[03:33] <popey> you pull down a little anywhere on the right, and then slide to the right or left to choose an indicator, then down to show it
[03:33] <popey> its really nice
[03:34] <popey> even things like the design of the tiles, the curve in the corners is reflected in the font
[03:34] <popey> or vice versa ☺
[03:34] <jcastro> yeah the font looks great
[03:41] <mhall119> popey: the indicators look awesome
[03:42] <mhall119> and I *love* how the Unity dash elements translated to the phone
[03:42] <bkerensa> mhall119: Ubuntu on Desktop in American Store http://i.imgur.com/jZQd6.jpg
[03:42] <bkerensa> :D
[03:43] <mhall119> bkerensa: sweet, what store is that?
[03:43] <bkerensa> mhall119: Frys
[03:43] <bkerensa> best computer store in the world
[03:43] <bkerensa> :)
[03:43] <bkerensa> mhall119: Frys is like Walmart Supercenter for Geeks
[03:43]  * popey went to frys in palo alto when he was there
[03:43] <popey> the first one I think
[03:44] <bkerensa> yeah
[03:44] <popey> it was made to look like a chip
[03:44] <bkerensa> yep
[03:44] <bkerensa> thats a small one too
[03:44] <bkerensa> :)
[03:44] <popey> the entrance had a giant Enter key on it, and the exit had an Escape key
[03:44] <popey> yeah
[03:44] <popey> do like frys
[03:44] <bkerensa> the one up here in outside of Portland is probably larger than a Walmart Supercenter
[03:45] <popey> man that was 10 years ago
[03:46] <bkerensa> popey: you should go again
[03:46] <bkerensa> satisfy the inner geek
[03:49] <popey> heh
[03:49] <popey> at the time I didn't have kids
[03:49] <popey> wanted to move out there
[08:58] <czajkowski> aloha
[12:03] <cjohnston> 22
[13:09] <nigelb> 23
[13:36] <czajkowski> popey: brilliant having richard on talking to webmink!
[13:38] <popey> yeah
[13:38] <czajkowski> very articlate and clear and good
[13:38] <czajkowski> :)
[13:41]  * AlanBell is listening to it too
[13:42] <czajkowski> this would have been what I'd have prefered to have seen yesterday for a hangout
[13:42] <czajkowski> interview and technical
[13:43] <popey> blimey, it's only one day later
[13:43] <popey> less than a day later
[13:44] <czajkowski> tis just some feedback :)
[13:49] <popey> that was fun
[13:51]  * AlanBell goes back to watch the first half
[13:57] <czajkowski> popey: cheers for answering gareth was just trying to find out
[13:57] <popey> ☺
[14:25] <jcastro> ok so this phone interview with webmink is good?
[14:25] <czajkowski> jcastro: yes
[14:25] <czajkowski> very informative
[14:25] <AlanBell> it is OK, he is a very gentle interviewer and got some good information out
[14:27] <czajkowski> don't know if I'd say gentle, more that he's clued in and knows how to be professional on an interview
[14:29] <popey> I would imagine he'd get tougher questions from some others
[14:29] <czajkowski> nods
[14:30] <jcastro> lol
[14:31] <jcastro> "Your detractors, which are, inexpclicably, from the free software community instead of your competitors..."
[14:31] <popey> heh
[14:31] <popey> yeah
[14:31] <jcastro> that is the funniest thing I've heard in a while
[14:34] <mhall119> jcastro: +1
[14:34] <mhall119> we are our own worst critics
[14:35] <imbrandon> we are our loudest, not sure about worst :)
[14:35] <mhall119> when the super meat boy thing exploded, someone posted it on the ubuntu and gaming subreddits.  The Ubuntu one was full of people accusing Canonical of all manner of stuff, the gaming one was far more critical of team meat's handling of it
[14:35] <czajkowski> imbrandon: no worst
[14:36] <mhall119> imbrandon: I'd say both
[14:37] <imbrandon> heh, well ok i conceed
[14:37] <imbrandon> :)
[14:39] <popey> WE ARE AWESOME!
[14:39] <popey> It's all those other fsckers!
[14:39] <jcastro> mhall119: yeah
[14:40] <imbrandon> frakkers > fsckers :P
[14:40] <jcastro> someone on /r/linux yesterday from RH was like "we're making a FOSS alternative to PPAs."
[14:40] <jcastro> it's like dang dude, it's only been AGPL for 4 years
[14:40] <imbrandon> umm isnt LP agpl
[14:40] <imbrandon> yea
[14:41] <imbrandon> given the ability for PPA's to make RPM's ala SuSE build service would be nice but yea ...
[14:42] <czajkowski> you can now have community ARM built ppas also
[14:42] <czajkowski> fast builds
[14:42] <czajkowski> *faster
[14:45] <jcastro> popey: are you pals with webmink? Seems like a good chap to have onair too
[14:46] <popey> kinda, online "pals"
[14:46] <popey> we've had him on UUPC before
[14:46] <popey> he is a good guy to have on, long history
[14:47] <mhall119> czajkowski: what do you need to do to build for arm in your ppa?
[14:47] <czajkowski> ask me nicely :)
[14:48] <czajkowski> https://twitter.com/launchpad_net/status/278160578474803200
[14:48] <imbrandon> oh nice :)
[14:51] <imbrandon> czajkowski: those Calxeda bajillion core boxen doing the builds ?
[14:51] <popey> those calxeda boxes nobody can get hold of ☺
[14:51] <imbrandon> heh
[14:52] <imbrandon> my next guess was a room full of Rasbery Pi's :)
[14:52] <jcastro> if you need an ARM build we have an AMI for ARM builds that simulates the calxeda box
[14:52] <jcastro> nice
[14:52] <jcastro> "it will be the most open platform in the industry."
[14:52] <nigelb> cjohnston: congrats?
[14:53] <imbrandon> jcastro: isnt it VERY slow tho ?
[14:53] <cjohnston> nigelb: ehh
[14:53] <czajkowski> imbrandon: narp
[14:53] <nigelb> cjohnston: just late to do that? :P
[14:56] <imbrandon> later might be intresting to start some actual arm PPA builds for phone/mobile testing, but for now even my Pi is still sitting in its container it was posted in :)
[14:56] <AlanBell> http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.10/qml/mobile/resolution-independence.html is the best feature of the whole announcement, and wasn't mentioned :)
[14:57] <jcastro> heh
[14:57] <jcastro> AlanBell: yeah, I think leading off with "we're shooting to be the most open" would have stopped some of the haters.
[14:57] <jcastro> but whatever, haters gonna hate
[14:57] <imbrandon> AlanBell: thats likely because in reality its very hard, ever develop for iOS ( iPad and iPhone resolution indepdance ) sux and must be well thought out even with nice tools like QML helping
[14:58] <imbrandon> in reality just scaling the same UI isnt the best solution most of the time
[14:58] <AlanBell> no, it wouldn't help to say that it is the most open unless that was backed up with a bzr repo at the time of the announcement, I am glad they didn't go big on the "open" thing
[14:59] <jcastro> nah, if it was in a bzr repo people would just complain it wasn't on github. :p
[14:59] <imbrandon> hah
[15:00] <AlanBell> what wasn't stressed enough was that this is for the next generation of phones with octocores and retina displays etc. It was demoed on a phone that google have discontinued sales of and was a bit laggy, but that doesn't matter a bit
[15:00] <AlanBell> people are thinking that it is supposed to go on the 2011 nexus and not the 2014 monster
[15:01] <imbrandon> in fairness it did talk about lower end emerging market devices
[15:01] <AlanBell> Canonical need a beast of an operating system to go to the OEMs because the OEMs need to convince the public that they need to buy new more powerful phones
[15:02] <jcastro> I have a GN
[15:02] <jcastro> and even the unfinished ubuntu thing looks faster than android on my phone
[15:02] <popey> yeah, the goal is two tier, low end and "SUPERRRRR-PHOOOONES!"
[15:02] <jcastro> though I haven't compared it side to side
[15:02] <popey> with capes on or something
[15:03]  * mhall119 wants a caped Ubuntu Phone
[15:06] <JoseeAntonioR> hey guys, want to know, who's 'the phone team' conformed by?
[15:07] <czajkowski> conformed?
[15:07] <JoseeAntonioR> I mean, which teams are part of 'the phone team'?
[15:07] <JoseeAntonioR> or there isn't one yet?
[15:08] <imbrandon> mhall119: i just want mine in tights, no cape :)
[15:09] <mhall119> imbrandon: TMI
[15:10] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: it's product strategy
[15:10] <imbrandon> lol, in all seriousness /me goes to seek out the preview SDK , bbiab

[16:29] <jcastro> get it up asap
[16:29] <jcastro> and then tweak later
[16:29] <jcastro> if we spend back and forth time with IS on the theme prior to that it'll probably take us another 2 years.

[18:08] <popey> it is a wiki czajkowski ☺
[18:09] <mhall119> popey: is that supposed to be encouraging or discouraging?
[18:09] <czajkowski> popey: am attempting to log off and poke jon to go for spin in the new vroooom vrooom :)
[18:09] <czajkowski> plus still not sure why we're adding all the press stuff to a wiki in the first place :)
[18:09] <mhall119> czajkowski: for fun and profit
[18:11] <czajkowski> makes no sense :) but to each their own, as you say tis  a wiki
[18:11] <czajkowski> now vrooo  vrooom time
[18:11] <popey> mhall119: i have a t-shirt which has "It *is* a wiki!" on it because in our local LUG people would email the mailing list asking people to fix wiki pages

[18:26] <jono> popey, gonna post to the FB page about the Q+A, can you server take that kind of traffic?
[18:26] <popey> hmmm
