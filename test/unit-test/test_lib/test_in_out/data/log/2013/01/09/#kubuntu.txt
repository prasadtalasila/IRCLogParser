[05:34] <kubuntuser> hello
[05:34] <kubuntuser> hi Jenm
[05:35] <dniMretsaM> hi kubuntuser
[06:52] <cjae> what does one use to get the laptop camera working in kubuntu 12.10, never have used a desktop cam very often so I am unfamiliar with software

[07:20] <hateball> cjae: do you know for sure it does *not* work?
[07:20] <hateball> cjae: you can test it in VLC for instance
[07:21] <cjae> hateball: no I was just wondering what softwares are for it. I see kamoso, but seems development is stale at 2010
[07:21] <cjae> cheese it gtk
[07:21] <cjae> is*
[07:22]  * cjae hasnt installed yet, waiting on a disk image
[07:22] <hateball> Well I don't know what you're looking to do :D
[07:22] <hateball> kde-telepathy has support for it in the protocols supporting cams (iirc)
[07:22] <hateball> And you can use it in VLC as I mentioned
[07:22] <cjae> setting up someone with kubuntu instead of windows
[07:23] <cjae> I dont use webcams so I have no idea
[07:23] <cjae> for example have never even seen skype
[07:23] <cjae> except the logo lol
[07:24] <cjae> ok
[07:24] <hateball> well, launch vlc, open "capture" and pick video for linux
[07:24] <hateball> should stream the webcam
[07:24] <cjae> ok
[07:24] <hateball> that way you know it works
[07:24] <cjae> sure
[07:25] <hateball> then it's up to the individual apps to make use of it
[07:26] <cjae> seems that kde is such a full fledged DE you would think such a thing would have more attention
[07:26] <hateball> I don't see what you mean?
[07:26] <hateball> Why would you have an app whose sole purpose is to show what is on the webcam
[07:27] <cjae> well what does cheese do
[07:27] <hateball> lets you watch yourself, and I think you can add filters and what not
[07:27] <hateball> if you want to record yourself
[07:27] <cjae> I see
[07:28] <hateball> And you could still run it in KDE even if it's GTK :p
[07:28] <cjae> I meant like cheese for qt, with some active development
[07:28] <cjae> right
[07:28] <mah454> I can not run KDE Desktop in VNC server !
[07:28] <mah454> this is my xstartup : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1512043/
[07:28] <mah454> How can fix this problem ?
[07:29] <cjae> but I mean when I start a laptop with unity, I can set a picture for my user off webcam
[07:30] <hateball> cjae: well that's a nice cosmetic touch I guess, no one is stopping you from adding it to KDE/Kubuntu ;)
[07:30] <hateball> in the meantime, if all you want is a photo of yourself you can take that using VLC, so
[07:30] <cjae> ya
[07:31] <cjae> oh it can take stills
[07:31] <cjae> I thought it just print screen
[07:31] <cjae> and had to crop

[09:42] <ubottu> netsplit is when two IRC servers of the same network (like freenode) disconnect from each other, so users on one server stop seeing users on the other. If this is happening now, just relax and enjoy the show. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netsplit

[13:35] <zoie> hello, how can i switch desktops with my keyboard?
[13:38] <lordievader> zoie: I believe that there is no default keyboard shortcut for, however you can create one.
[13:39] <zoie> lordievader: i think i did something with "tab" and some of my windows disappeared
=== vinces1979 is now known as vinces
[13:40] <lordievader> zoie: Systemsettings -> Shortcuts -> Global Keyboard shortcuts -> Kwin -> look for "Switch Desktop"
[13:40] <zoie> lordievader: it's ctrl+F1 and such but that's not what i did
[13:41] <lordievader> zoie: Ah, that is probably the Activities (super+tab)
[13:41] <zoie> lordievader: yes thanks :)
[13:41] <lordievader> zoie: No problem ;)

[15:43] <Wizard> Seems Kubuntu run pretty well - nobody with troubles today :)
[15:52] <Peace-Flu> Wizard: :)
[16:51] <Third3ye> ...
[16:51] <Third3ye> What are the keyboard shortucs for changing desktops?
[16:51] <Third3ye> shortcuts
[16:52] <sbivol> Third3ye: Ctrl+F1,F2...
[16:52] <Third3ye> lol -- that simple, ey? Thanks :)
[16:54] <Third3ye> So can anyone confirm of the rumors are founded?
[16:54] <Third3ye> That KDE is losing developers and is in danger of becoming unmaintainable?
[16:56] <OerHeks>  rumours .. check your sources
[16:56] <tsimpson> I'm going to take a wild guess and say "HA! no"
[17:08] <Third3ye> First time I'm relieved to see journalistic integrity ia still just a warm memory :P
[17:10] <OerHeks> Third3ye, let me guess, that article you refer too, is written on friday afternoon ?
[17:15] <Third3ye> DerHeks: I actually read it like 3 weeks ago, and from where I'm not sure
[17:18] <dougl> friday afternoon after cocktail hour you mean?
[17:18] <Third3ye> But like my dad always says: there are no stupid questions, only answers with stupid premise :P
[17:24] <OerHeks> dougl, more like a deadline-article
[17:25] <dougl> ah - thanks... more media ppl trying to get attention.
[17:25] <OerHeks> Third3ye, maybe the source of this all is that Kubuntu is no longer supported financially by ubuntu, but KDE is strong
[17:27] <Riddell> Third3ye: huh?  we have plenty of developers
[17:27] <Riddell> OerHeks: Kubuntu remains part of Ubuntu just as it always has been
[17:30] <OerHeks> Riddell, correct, but Blue Systems is sponsoring now?
[17:30] <Third3ye> DerHeks: HA! "oooo... a big company is no longer supporting an open source project... IT WILL SURELY DIE!"
[17:30] <Third3ye> xD
[17:31] <Riddell> OerHeks: Blue Systems is one sponsor yes
[17:33] <Third3ye> Anyways
[17:33] <Third3ye> I have bought a new keyboard, a Microsoft keyboard... Sidewinder X4 to be specific
[17:34] <Third3ye> Some of it's extra keys are not recognised by the KDE keyboard shortcut settings
[17:34] <Third3ye> Any hints as to how I can fix this?
[17:34] <Third3ye> And how do I assign an action to JUST the <meta> key... without having to add another key in to the shortcut
[17:35] <dniMretsaM> Third3ye: you might want to look at ksuperkey

[23:28] <keithzg-mobile> So are there Kubuntu images for the Nexus 7 yet?
[23:53] <RaphaelBarros> DOes anybody there knows how to make a panel stay on its place after reboot? I have replace my top panel for a new one (since it was unable to hide or be covered by windows), and now this panel moves to another place every time I boot kubuntu
[23:53] <RaphaelBarros> Even while I'm using kubuntu, it changes place
[23:54] <RaphaelBarros> To the middle of the screen, for example
[23:56] <sonyvaioduo11> has anyone managed to use kubuntu on the sony vaio duo 11?
