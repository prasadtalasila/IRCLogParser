[00:57] <Andy80> hi
[00:58] <Andy80> do you know if other then this one http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/app-developer-cookbook/mobile/currency-converter-phone-app/ there is another example possibly using not only QML but QML/C++ ?
[01:01] <chriadam> Andy80: http://doc-snapshot.qt-project.org/5.0/qtqml/qtqml-cppintegration-topic.html
[01:06] <Andy80> chriadam, oh thank you :) I knew it, but I did think there was something specific for Ubuntu components :) even better for what I've to do ;) thanks :)
[06:07] <bobweaver> OMG every time the dang ppa is updated it does not work for more and more people !!!!!!!
[06:08] <bobweaver> Targeting one qtversion aka beta 1 is not the best of ideas just saying. Not mad but something needs to be done about this

[14:27] <mhall119> bobweaver: what is targeting specific qt versions?
[14:28] <bobweaver> ?
[14:28] <smartboyhw> mhall119, do you know when qt5.0 is packaged for raring?
[14:28] <bobweaver> Oh the compents
[14:28] <bobweaver> er
[14:28] <mhall119> bobweaver: our components?
[14:28] <bobweaver> Yeah
[14:28] <mhall119> smartboyhw: you mean non-beta packages?
[14:29] <smartboyhw> mhall119, yeah. qt5.0 is available for 12.10 but not 13.04, which I really :(
[14:29] <mhall119> bobweaver: can you file a bug on https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-ui-toolkit telling them where they're doing that?
[14:29] <bobweaver> Components *
[14:29] <mhall119> I'm not sure if this is something you can contribute a fix to or not
[14:30] <bobweaver> things are in different places mhall119  depending on what qt5 version you have installed
[14:30] <mhall119> smartboyhw: I'll see if we can get precise and raring builds
[14:30] <smartboyhw> mhall119, thx:D
[14:34] <bobweaver> mhall119,  I guess that I just think that it is a little bit silly to be building off of beta 1
[14:34] <bobweaver> when final is released
[14:35] <bobweaver> I guess that this is more of a wish list thing. for qt-edgers ppa
[14:36] <mhall119> bobweaver: they've got final packages in a separate PPA now, but only for quantal atm
[14:36] <mhall119> https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers/+archive/qt5-proper
[14:37] <bobweaver> mhall119,  cool ! how does that play against the ubuntu-ui-toolkit ?
[14:37] <bobweaver> I mean I am sure that it is easy to install but from ppa ?
[14:38] <mhall119> bobweaver: that I don't know, these packages install it to /usr/ instead of /opt/
[14:38] <mhall119> but the ~test1 in the version number makes me cautious
[14:38] <bobweaver> I see that Gabor Loki has a ppa also ?
[14:39] <bobweaver> for sed kit
[14:45] <Traumatizer> I''m sorry if this is a dumb question but I can't really seem to find any documentation on developing for ubuntu phone other than the CurrencyConverter tutorial.
[14:46] <Traumatizer> Yea it was pretty dumb. I found it: http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.10/qml/mobile/overview-ubuntu-sdk.html

[17:50] <Traumatizer> Hi, does anyone know how I can make an object extend from another? For exampe: URLContainer extends Rectangle like you would do in Java
[18:03] <disharmonic> Traumatizer, dunno. Maybe try the #qt channel. Or some of the other related ones
[18:07] <Traumatizer> Alright disharmonic. But I don't know if it would work in the first place. I'd need to create a new instance of that object than too. Using something like: New URLContainer = new URLContainer(arguments)
[18:07] <Traumatizer> and I doubt that is possible in Qt but i'm very inexperienced, so who knows
[18:09] <disharmonic> Traumatizer, I directed you to the QT channel because you posted this in #ubuntu-phone that uses QT5/QML  for UIs
[18:10] <Traumatizer> disharmonic, but how can you than program an app? If Qt is only used for the UI? You need more than that right
[18:15] <disharmonic> Not sure, it's supposed to be running a full linux stack under the hood. C++ at least i guess or any compiled language that has QT bindings

[23:46] <Pip> Good
[23:46] <usr13> Pip: Sorry...
[23:46] <Pip> it's okay
[23:46] <Pip> Glad to be here
[23:47] <Pip> I want to know what exactly Ubuntu for Android means
[23:48] <Pip> Is it an OS or a mobile computing device like a Ubuntu phone
[23:49] <Pip> Actually what I want is to install Ubuntu on my android phone
[23:49] <Pip> So that I don't need to buy another Ubuntu phone
[23:50] <k1l> Pip: ubuntu4android is the same like the motorola webtop or nettop thing. you have a smartphone with android and when you dock it you get a full ubuntu like on your pc. that is included in the ubuntu-phone now
[23:51] <Pip> Sounds magic
[23:51] <k1l> Pip: and when you read the topic, you see that there are no images or code published, yet.
[23:51] <k1l> and on the ubuntu.com page you can see the hardware requirements for ubuntu-phone. so you can see if your phone meets it
[23:52] <Pip> I thought they could just release some ROM as free software and I download to burn into my Android phone
[23:52] <Pip> thanks
[23:53] <Pip> I don't know about motoroal webtop or nettop
[23:53] <Pip> But I'd check them out
[23:54] <k1l> Pip: they will release some testing images and the code end of feb. but if its that easy to run on your phone i cant tell you
[23:54] <Pip> Understood
[23:54] <k1l> Pip: the motorola webtop thing is just to give you an idea what ubuntu4android is.
[23:55] <Pip> So once I dock the phone, I get Ubuntu OS started ?
[23:55] <k1l> yep
[23:55] <Pip> Interesting
[23:56] <Pip> So with a Ubuntu phone, the docking part is redundant, right?
[23:57] <k1l> yep. that is included in ubuntu-phone
[23:58] <k1l> that is ubuntu4ubuntu, if you want to call that feature :)
[23:59] <k1l> but IIRC you need the more powerfull hardware mentioned in the specs table for the ubuntu4ubuntu thing
