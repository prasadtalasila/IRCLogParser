[01:40] <qnm> hi folks, I want to buy a 4g modem for use on Telstra - anyone have any opinions on whether I seek out a Sierra 320U or get something like a ZTE MF821? I'm on 12.10.
[10:18] <pippo_> hello
[10:18] <pippo_> quit
[10:45] <jea> qnm: i have a 4g wireless router-like device that 5 other wireless devices can connect to
[10:46] <jea> i find that much easier than a usb dongle, as multiple devices can use it at the same time, and you don't have to worry about drivers
[11:28] <head_victim> qnm & jea: if you're using it as a primary source I've found it's generally even better to try and get the home network gateways. They're just not portable.
[12:46] <mesquka> I have fibre optic, troll, fast, for outdoors a  good 3G telstra stick usually does it for me
[12:46] <mesquka> (usb)
[12:55] <jea> head_victim: yeah, i can imagine that would be better. at least for me it is hardly used due to having cable at home
[13:13] <head_victim> jea: we use it on holidays so we can both be on a stable connection.
[13:14] <head_victim> It's also plugged in to my second wan point as a failover if the cable goes down.
[13:14] <head_victim> (which I can count on one hand in the years I've lived here)
[13:18] <jea> we have had a few more cable outages than that, but it was when we first got it
[13:18] <jea> the port we were connected to was faulty, so once they swapped it, we were fine
[13:23] <head_victim> Ah that would be a pain, at least they sorted it eventually.
[13:23] <head_victim> Anyway, I should head off to bed, night mesquka and jea 
[13:31] <jea> night head_victim 
[13:32] <mesquka> night
[22:15] <blahdeblah> head_victim: Sorry about the big mailing list post - i didn't realise our limit was so low.  Hope the new one meets with your approval. :-)
