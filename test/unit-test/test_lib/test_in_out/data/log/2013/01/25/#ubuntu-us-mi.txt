[00:21] <jjesse-home> ok this might be one of the worst job ads I've seen "Do you offer the Net to go with the Dot? The # to go with the C? The “j” to complete the Query? The right mix of P’s, H’s, and P’s to have the experience we need in PHP? Can you make it all happen with an O an O and a P through OOP? "
[00:55] <snap-l> Do you break your bytes into bits?
[00:57] <snap-l> we can't function without your methods, so break from your normal case and gosub us now
[00:58] <snap-l> WE promise we won't break you.
[00:58] <snap-l> or leave you in an infinite loop
[01:01] <snap-l> We're anything but routine

[02:28] <jcastro> hey rick
[02:28] <jcastro> I can't find a decent Teac stoll for Jill for the shower, make me one yo
[02:28] <rick_h_> jcastro: what's up
[02:28] <rick_h_> teak stool?
[02:33] <jcastro> yeah
[02:33] <jcastro> you know, for the shower
[02:33] <jcastro> http://www.amazon.com/Teak-Folding-Shower-Bench-Stool/dp/B001O8KW82
[02:33] <rick_h_> no, but google suggested teak stool so looking
[02:33] <jcastro> like that
[02:33] <jcastro> but not ass
[02:33] <jcastro> http://www.amazon.com/Corner-Solid-Teak-Shower-Outdoor/dp/B005LQ8J3S/ref=pd_sim_sbs_hg_2

[02:35] <rick_h_> http://www.bedbathandbeyond.com/1/1/57563-teak-asia-stool.html isn't bad looking
[02:35] <rick_h_> shame they didn't curve the legs some to go with the top but that makes it a pita to make I guess
[02:36] <derekv> i royally declare the state of computing to be,... bullshit
[02:36] <rick_h_> now here you go http://cgi.ebay.com/Danish-Modern-Teak-Stool-Chair-Bench-Mid-Century-Wegner-Finn-Juhl-Eames-Era_W0QQitemZ290781763219QQcmdZViewItemQQssPageNameZRSS:B:SRCH:US:101
[02:36] <rick_h_> jcastro: ^^
[02:37] <rick_h_> derekv: and the new part of this statement is? :P
[02:38] <derekv> so i figured out you can compile hundreds of dependancies deep in freebsd generally without a problem
[02:38] <derekv> all with their nested ports makefile system
[02:38] <derekv> as long as its a fresh system
[02:38] <derekv> trying do maintain updates that way
[02:38] <derekv> things go way out of wack
[02:39] <rick_h_> updating is hard, let's go shopping
[02:40] <rick_h_> jcastro: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Grade-A-Teak-Wood-Stool-W-Shelf-Shower-Spa-Bath-Bench-Outdoor-Garden-Patio-New-/290614467120 isn't bad looking
[02:41] <derekv> basically want I want is a system where I specify what things are important to me.  if its important what version, I specify that, or if its important I have the most recent, I say so, otherwise give me the most stable that is known to match the other requirements I have given
[02:41] <derekv> instead of upgrading
[02:42] <derekv> take a snapshot of my system
[02:42] <derekv> rebuild from scratch
[02:42] <derekv> given the requirements
[02:42] <derekv> if something fails, or in the morning I find I don't like it, I get to roll back
[02:42] <derekv> don't try to upgrade in place
[02:42] <derekv> just, new system as per my requirements
[02:43] <derekv> apply my patches to config files
[02:43] <derekv> boot
[02:47] <derekv> rick_h_: you know how you made your makefile to roll out all the requirements, at least given an ubuntu system
[02:47] <derekv> I want that for my entire operating system
[02:47] <derekv> I don't care about upgrade
[02:47] <derekv> here's the other way of putting it
[02:48] <derekv> worked on a system where customer data was in the database, but the scheme was evolving
[02:48] <derekv> what I wanted that never quit happened was this
[02:48] <derekv> we started with the schema of the last release
[02:49] <derekv> CI applied the patches, including the schema upgrade scripts, given a snapshot or dump taken from the last release point
[02:50] <derekv> basically at every commit, CI tries to do the full upgrade
[02:50] <derekv> part of the "tests" that CI runs, is testing the upgrade process
[02:50] <derekv> I want that for my OS
[02:51] <derekv> the previous release point is my current system
[02:51] <derekv> but in my case, I think I can remove much of the "state" eg the database
[02:51] <derekv> just start with a base OS install, apply patches
[02:51] <derekv> if I don't like, I back out, and adjust the patches untill they work
[02:59] <rick_h_> http://wwwapps.ups.com/WebTracking/track?HTMLVersion=5.0&loc=en_US&Requester=UPSHome&WBPM_lid=homepage%2Fct1.html_pnl_trk&trackNums=1ZV6292VD370121254&track.x=Track
[02:59] <rick_h_> ugh, wtf...I think it's trapped
[02:59] <rick_h_> derekv: yea, but that's hard. I know with ubuntu we've worked on smoke tests and doing upgrades/etc
[03:00] <rick_h_> but it's not on a continous package by package and with 30k packages there's amore than a few combinations to test out there
[03:27] <derekv> rick_h_: its not trivial no ... thats why id be running tests on my own paticular combination
[03:28] <derekv> no OS packager could run tests on every combination, and its even more ridiculus when you throw in upgrades
[03:42] <snap-l> fuck
[03:42] <snap-l> I wan t to know why fucking dropbox keeps wigging out on me
[05:44] <greg-g> I wish nixternal was in the channel:
[05:44] <greg-g> http://via.me/-93ay55w
[13:01] <snap-l> I think I need to post my dropbox problem on askubuntu.com
[13:02] <rick_h_> sounds like a plan
[13:02] <rick_h_> or their forums on their site
[13:03] <brousch> ubuntu forums is your best bet
[13:04] <rick_h_> I meant dropbox forums
[13:04] <rick_h_> https://forums.dropbox.com/
[13:04] <brousch> I didn't
[13:04] <rick_h_> :P
[13:05] <brousch> muahahahahaha
[14:00] <snap-l> http://phys.org/news/2012-10-sweden-norway-trash-lots.html
[14:08] <jcastro> hmm so blowing away the dot directory didn't work?
[14:28] <snap-l> jcastro: Nope.
[14:29] <snap-l> I've even tried blowing away the .dropbox-dist directory to no luck
[14:31] <jcastro> huh
[14:31] <jcastro> and you're sure your user has the correct permissions to ~/Dropbox?
[14:31] <brousch> Could it be a problematic file messing you up?
[14:32] <snap-l> jcastro: It Seems to stop working after a while, so it starts off just fine
[14:33] <snap-l> It's the damndest thing
[14:34] <snap-l> I could understand it not working at all, but I'm not sure why it stops working after working perfectly.
[14:34] <snap-l> dmesg doesn't have anything
[14:37] <snap-l> Keyboard is on the truck
[14:37] <snap-l> drive! drive like the wind!
[14:46] <rick_h_> lol
[14:47] <rick_h_> the wife's laptop is on the truck as well. delivery friday!
[14:47] <rick_h_> 3 days clearing in KY, but finally free!
[14:48] <rick_h_> ugh, it's kind of nasty out
[14:48] <rick_h_> and I'll never understand the white cards in white snow without headlights on
[14:54] <snap-l> Yeah, I don't understand that either
[14:54] <snap-l> or grey cars in rain without lights.
[14:55] <snap-l> THis is not the time for camoflauge
[14:58] <jjesse> or dark cars at night w/o lights
[14:58] <jjesse> i just want to run into them
[14:58] <snap-l> http://www.littersystem.com/productinfo.html
[14:58]  * jjesse smashes cars w/o headlights
[14:58] <jcastro> dang, more snow
[14:59] <jcastro> it just passed the "Should I shovel it" threshold
[14:59] <snap-l> Apparently one of my goals is to research cat litter.
[14:59] <snap-l> jcastro: You must have a low threshold, or we haven't received enough yet.
[15:00] <jcastro> I got a tiny bit
[15:00] <jcastro> enough to not shovel
[15:00] <jcastro> but now I got some more, enough to shovel when added with the other stuff
[15:00] <jcastro> and I really shouldn't make my UPS guy do the sidewalk without at least some salt.
[15:32] <rick_h_droid> yea cleared and salted yesterday and they're saying 2inches today
[15:32] <jcastro> oh, so I should wait a bit then
[17:40] <snap-l> Woo woo! New keyboard showed up. :)
[17:40] <snap-l> And it's way more quiet. :
[17:41] <snap-l> Heh
[17:45] <snap-l> Might not even need the dampers.
[17:45] <rick_h_> heh

[19:45] <brousch> Ubuntu forums? I smell a troll link
[19:47] <greg-g> brousch: nope, I'm subscribed via rss to our sub-forum there from way back when
[19:54] <brousch> Replied
[19:54] <brousch> Thanks for the heads-up
[19:59] <greg-g> np
[20:02] <snap-l> brousch: Would you create a separate topic that people are more likely to find folks on the mailing list than on the forums?
[20:02] <snap-l> I have no idea who half of these folks are in the forum. :)
[20:02] <brousch> eh?
[20:03] <snap-l> ie: "please stop posting in the forums, because were it not for greg-g, nobody would read it. ;) "
[20:03]  * snap-l deleted his forum account long ago
[20:03] <brousch> greg-g has a sticky thread
[20:03] <brousch> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=515718
[20:04] <brousch> There's like 1 post every 6 months
[20:04] <snap-l> Could we make it a little more "stop posting here? :)"
[20:05] <greg-g> :)
[20:05] <greg-g> yeah, lemme remember what my password is :)
[20:06] <brousch> That's what lastpass is for
[20:06] <snap-l> I don't want people to get the impression that we're not active because we don't use the forums
[20:07]  * greg-g nods
[20:07] <brousch> ah
[20:09] <greg-g> how's this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=515718
[20:09] <brousch> I don't see how to make somthing sticky
[20:10] <snap-l> greg-g: better. Thank you.
[20:10] <snap-l> greg-g: Maybe even in the title
[20:10] <snap-l> "This group is deprecated" or something like that.
[20:10] <snap-l> s/group/forum/
[20:11] <greg-g> don't think I can.
[20:11] <snap-l> Bugger.
[20:11] <snap-l> Frankly, I'd love to see the forums deprecated entirely.
[20:11] <snap-l> I think Ask Ubuntu takes over the forum nicely.
[20:13] <snap-l> Yes, I know some folks think the forums are the bee's knees, but I'm ready to mark them as "no" under my search preferences.
[20:14] <snap-l> greg-g: Just refreshed. Thank you!

[23:32] <snap-l> that's all
[23:35] <brousch> then it should definitely be py3
