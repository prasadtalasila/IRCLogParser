[00:02] <ow> Dear #ubuntu: I'm using the latest Ubuntu LTS. What's the fastest, easiest way to share a folder in a way that Windows machines (actually, my Samsung Blu-Ray player that automatically discovers network shares) can see it?
[00:02] <sarsaeol> samba
[00:02] <ActionParsnip> ow: use nautilus, right click folder and share
[00:03] <sarsaeol> ^
[00:04] <dpurgert> install linux on the bluray player? :D

[00:10] <jhutchins_wk> The startup disk creator mentioned earlier is for an emergency boot disk, not an installer.
[00:11] <jhutchins_wk> ow: If that doesn't work, look into a upnp server like mediatomb.
[00:13] <ixio2> anyone able to help me usig shaperd and/or wondershaper to throttle a single port INTO my ubuntu box?

[00:14] <kusznir> Hi all: quick question: ubuntu 10.04, running as a server (no gui).  I've built my firewall rules; iptables -L shows what I want.  What's the "proper ubuntu way" to set those to persist across reboots?
[00:15] <dpurgert> kusznir, add an entry to your /etc/network/interfaces
[00:16] <kusznir> dpurgert: I don't see anything in there that enlightens me how to do this...There's a whole ruleset.  (On most other OSes, I'd run /etc/init.d/iptables save).  Google keeps turning up more old/wrong/bad info than good...Any specific recommendations?
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:16] <ActionParsnip> kusznir: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo   shows how to setup the iptables to be setup at boot
[00:17] <Anonimo> hi
[00:18] <TheLordOfTime> kusznir, my suggestion? install iptables-persistent
[00:19] <TheLordOfTime> kusznir, it'll save rules into /etc/iptables/rules.v4 or /etc/iptables/rules.v6 (one's ipv4 one's ipv6), and will reload them on boot.
[00:20] <theverant> Reading package lists takes fooooorrrrreeevvveeeeeerrrr
[00:20] <theverant> I mean like 5 mins+
[00:20] <theverant> new install of 12.10
[00:20] <theverant> anyone have ideas?
[00:20] <kusznir> Thanks all!
[00:20] <TheLordOfTime> theverant, because its a new installation?
[00:21] <TheLordOfTime> theverant, also, your connection may be slow.
[00:21] <theverant> I don't think it's my connection
[00:21] <theverant> but I will try to change servers

[00:25] <memand> Hey guys, I have a 32-bit  version installed on a 64-bit machine that I have been using for a while now. Is there a way to upgrade it to 64-bit while keeping all my files and setting and installed stuff?
[00:25] <theverant> This is an i7 machine w/ 32GB RAM.  Should not be so freakin slow
[00:26] <xangua> memand: backup your files, reinstall
[00:26] <dpurgert> memand, not really.  backup the files and reinstall the x64

[00:27] <Riley88> i enabled sna through x11.conf and i kept getting a gpu error apprt
[00:27] <Riley88> i has to disable the,
[00:27] <Riley88> them
[00:28] <memand> xangua dpurgert : Hmm ok, guess I'll have to weigh the advantages of a 64-bit system versus having to install everything again (especially since i just got my nVidia chip working :P )
[00:28] <theverant> man... this is basically unuseable.  Nobody else is reporting issues?  What the hell have I done now
[00:28] <Riley88> whats the issue
[00:28] <TheLordOfTime> theverant, it works fine for me in 12.10, even on 5 year old systems on just-barely high-speed connections
[00:29] <keber> hello in world is 4 rightheart one testicle mans, 4 rightheart gods, 4 leftheart one testicle mans, 4 leftheart gods, in moon is same
[00:29] <theverant> TheLordOfTime: I know! It's always been snappy for me too
[00:29] <theverant> but this is unreal
[00:29] <TheLordOfTime> theverant, it could just be temporary
[00:29] <theverant> actually... now that I think about it... the install seemed to take an awfully long time as well
[00:30] <theverant> but I did have updates turned on
[00:30] <theverant> so that was probably doing it
[00:30] <theverant> Isn't the Reading Package Lists function on my system though?  Reading the database it's just downloaded?
[00:32] <ixio2> what "session" should I use to disable unity?
[00:32] <ixio2> ?? unity
[00:32] <ixio2> !unity
[00:32] <ubottu> Unity is the default UI since Ubuntu 11.04.  Unity is a shell for GNOME. see http://unity.ubuntu.com. For a GNOME 2-like experience, see !notunity
[00:32] <theverant> Yeah, it's been 7 minutes and only 42% read so far
[00:32] <ixio2> !notunity
[00:32] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[00:32] <theverant> It's the same whether or not I use the Canadaian servers or the Main Server
[00:32] <ixio2> im trying to install freenx, this line is causing problems: COMMAND_START_GNOME='gnome-session --session=ubuntu'
[00:33] <ixio2> tried ubuntu-2d same issue

[00:34] <elky> keber, that doesn't look appropriate for here.
[00:34] <ixio2> wtf
[00:34] <theverant> ... also... there seems to be a serious lag when I open Software Sources in the settings window.  It's about 4 times as long to open as other settings maybe coincidence, maybe not
[00:35] <delphinas> guys did anyone have a problem with "flashing windows" in ubuntu using virtual box
[00:35] <theverant> keber: I have no idea what you are talking about, but wow
[00:35] <ow> I'm trying to install samba4 and dpkg is throwing a hissy fit about my smb.conf file, apparently it has a ton of invalid lines in it
[00:35] <delphinas> especially when you drag windows
[00:35] <SuperLag> I know there's a page with supported AMD / Nvidia video cards... been there. I'm just curious if any of you use dual displays on a desktop, where you have to connect them to a dongle.
[00:35] <SuperLag> And if you've run into any issues
[00:35] <Creed> but are you sure that is gonna work?
[00:36] <SuperLag> Creed: you talking to me?
[00:36] <ow> So I guess what I need to know is, what package do I reinstall to make smb.conf the skeletal default, and how do I do that
[00:39] <ow> What Ubuntu package creates /etc/samba/smb.conf ?
[00:39] <SuperLag> ow: I think installing the samba package itself does that
[00:40] <rootkit> Hi. Does 12.04 use the 3.x kernel or the 2.x kernel?
[00:41] <ActionParsnip> !info linux-image-generic precise | rootkit

[00:42] <SuperLag> nice patch :)
[00:44] <Cong> What do I need to install b43 drivers on lubuntu 12.10?
[00:44] <ActionParsnip> !broadcom | Cong
[00:44] <ubottu> Cong: Help with Broadcom bcm43xx can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[00:44] <memand> I think I'll stick with 32-bit. Unless anyone has some info about some serious advantage of 64-bit that I could not find with a quick google search
[00:44] <rootkit> Bugger. Do you then know how I can fix the issue with a Realtek 8188CE wireless card on the 3.x kernel? It works fine under 2.x but in 3.x the network-manager says its connected but it won't connect to any websites etc
[00:45] <ActionParsnip> memand: it helps with audio and video encoding
[00:45] <ActionParsnip> rootkit: can you ping 8.8.8.8?
[00:46] <rootkit> ActionParsnip: not from a 3.x kernel
[00:46] <rootkit> I can right now as I'm using something like Lucid
[00:47] <memand> ActionParsnip: The thing is I mainly use my laptop for coding.
[00:47] <rootkit> memand: long number support
[00:47] <rootkit> The future.
[00:47] <rootkit> Etc
[00:48] <SuperLag> memand: how much RAM do you have on the machine in question?
[00:48] <memand> SuperLag: 4 gigs
[00:48] <memand> SuperLag: so yeah it's a bit of a waste not to use all of it
[00:49] <SuperLag> I don't think it will recognize all 4GB
[00:49] <SuperLag> with 32-bit, that is
[00:49] <ow> okay, I apt-get remove'd samba and samba4, and then apt-get install'd them, and it didn't create smb.conf
[00:49] <Cong> ActionParsnip, there is nothing in there, in the section b43 - No Internet access, about 12.10.
[00:49] <usr13> SuperLag: 4G RAM is not a problem for a 32bit system.
[00:50] <fawxtrot> it is if it a windows system
[00:50] <memand> SuperLag: Actually, when I go in the sys info I can see that it's recognizing 3.8
[00:50] <memand> or what usr13 said
[00:50] <usr13> SuperLag: RAM is not a reason to not stay with 32bit system.
[00:50] <memand> :)
[00:51] <SuperLag> there are limits
[00:51] <necr0tik> i think alsa is only installed with xbmcbuntu. Is pulseaudio in there by default or just alsa?
[00:51] <SuperLag> 32-bit can only address so much
[00:51] <dr_willis> i basically only use 64 bit OS on all my 64bit hardware - reguardless of the ram.
[00:51] <Kion1> I am using 16GB on 64 bit no problems
[00:51] <ActionParsnip> Cong: you can install the debs you need from the install media
[00:52] <ActionParsnip> Cong: use the server method
[00:52] <SuperLag> the limits aren't an issue on current hardware, with 64-bit systems
[00:52] <memand> I have been reading some places that certain things (they did not specify what) is unstable on 64-bit, but it was some old articles so maybe that is not the case anymore?
[00:52] <SuperLag> the limits could be an issue on a 32-bit system
[00:53] <Cong> ActionParsnip, server method is?
[00:53] <SuperLag> memand: like what?
[00:53] <dr_willis> I cant think of anything i find unstable on 64bit.,
[00:53] <ActionParsnip> Cong: all in terminal
[00:53]  * SuperLag uses 64-bit in production... has for years. No issues.
[00:53] <usr13> memand: Some apps are not fully 64bit compatable
[00:53] <SuperLag> but that's true too
[00:53] <dr_willis> Only app i can recall that dident have 64bit port was zsnes. ;) but its working now on 64bit
[00:54] <memand> SuperLag: the only thing that they really specified was flash, but they have never been good with 64-bit on any system
[00:54] <dr_willis> Flash is a probopem on 32bit system...
[00:54] <dr_willis> flsah has been a problem for years and it dosent look like it will ever get much better.
[00:54] <SuperLag> s/on 32bit system//g
[00:54] <Kion1> Flash is a problem everywhere!
[00:54] <SuperLag> amen
[00:55] <memand> dr_willis: flash kind of has problems everywhere :P
[00:55] <usr13> dr_willis: flash has a problem on 64bit systems (flash is problem period :)
[00:55] <SuperLag> may it die a swift and quick death
[00:55] <dr_willis> memand:  i use flash-downloader tools and replacer plugins. ;)
[00:55] <SuperLag> if only  :/
[00:55] <SuperLag> I use Chrome for Flash.
[00:55] <dr_willis> Flash works very well on my 64bit system. :) but i also know of people with 32bit ubuntu systems that cant get flash going at all.
[00:55] <Cong> ActionParsnip, the files I need are b43-fwcutter and  firmware-b43-installer, right?
[00:56] <memand> well hopefully flash will soon die with the rise of html5
[00:56] <ActionParsnip> Cong: if thats what the guide says
[00:57] <Cong> ActionParsnip, I can't follow the guide it isn't for 12.10.
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> Cong: its the same
[00:59] <ow> http://pastebin.com/P23V0N2v
[00:59] <ow> I can't win >:(
[00:59] <memand> anyways I think that for the moment it's too much hassle for me to switch over (specially since I'm thinking about moving to arch at some point) I just needed a little input on what the difference actually would be
[00:59] <Cong> ActionParsnip, I'll give it a try. btw, did I mention it's for lubuntu?
[00:59] <memand> so thanks for the responce :)

[01:00] <ActionParsnip> Cong: the only different between that and ubuntu is the default apps and desktop. The underlying guts doing the actual work is identical
[01:00] <memand> dr_willis: flash-download and replace, how does that work? And to what end?
[01:01] <memand> keber: what???
[01:01] <dr_willis> memand:  i download any flash videos i want with the various flash-downloader plugins. they can download them in mp4, webm, or other formats.
[01:01] <ActionParsnip> memand: or you can use minitube :)
[01:01] <dr_willis> memand:  theres a flash-replacer pluygin that plays flash vidoes that i dont want to download.. in vlc or mplayer embeded in the browser.
[01:01] <memand> Ahh, thats a good idea
[01:01] <keber> hello in world is 4 rightheart one testicle mans, 4 rightheart gods, 4 leftheart one testicle mans, 4 leftheart gods, in moon is same
[01:02] <dr_willis> memand:  any other uses for flash at sites.. i never need. ;)
[01:02] <ActionParsnip> keber: do you have an ubuntu support question?
[01:02] <memand> dr_willis: nice :)
[01:03]  * memand goes to the plug-in sites (DIE FLASH, DIE)
[01:03] <ow> any idea from that pastebin what's going on? I'm trying to install samba, it tells me to rm /etc/samba/smb.conf, I do so, and then it says it can't install because /etc/samba/smb.conf doesn't exist
[01:04] <ActionParsnip> ow: make a blank smb.conf file to humour it, then uninstall

[01:36] <ubottu> sagitta007: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[01:36] <sagitta007> ok
[01:36] <wbf> crazybrain: I said what is your SPECS?
[01:37] <crazybrain> hardware is fine buddy
[01:37] <sagitta007> ok
[01:37] <wbf> crazybrain: does it have ATI
[01:37] <wbf> crazybrain or what
[01:37] <crazybrain> ATI?
[01:37] <wbf> crazybrain: or what? what graphicscard?

[01:38] <crazybrain> wbf: it has a graphics card
[01:38] <wbf> sagitta007: please use paste.ubuntu.com
[01:38] <crazybrain> i mean good graphics
[01:38] <sagitta007> Yes
[01:38] <sagitta007> Intel HD graphics
[01:39] <seednode> sagitta007, crazybrain isn't talking to you...
[01:39] <ActionParsnip> Cong: ok, install it
[01:39] <wbf> crazybrain: What graphics card? Nvidia, ATI, and Intel are all graphics card vendors, so which one?
[01:39] <sagitta007> *facepalm*
[01:40] <sagitta007> crazy brain talking to me
[01:40] <sagitta007> or some person
[01:40] <Cong> ActionParsnip, just reading through the guide this packages is used to install STA drivers.
[01:40] <somsip> !who | sagitta007
[01:40] <ubottu> sagitta007: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[01:40] <crazybrain> wbf: it's intel i think
[01:40] <crazybrain> wbf: it has inbuilt hd graphics
[01:41] <sagitta007> crazybrain: i need help
[01:41] <crazybrain> sagitta007: me too buddy
[01:41] <Cong> ActionParsnip, do I need to know anything else, because I'll be shuting down and starting lubuntu and I don't want to keep coming back here.
[01:41] <sagitta007> Damn
[01:41] <somsip> sagitta007: so how it works is you say clearly what your issue is. If someone can help, they often will. If no one can help, you might not get an answer and may need to come back later and ask again. See !patience
[01:42] <sagitta007> Need to change DHCP to Static IP in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
[01:42] <ActionParsnip> Cong: you will need to satisfy deps manually. Is the system a laptop?
[01:42] <Sir_Fawnpug> I am about ready to throw this server in the trash.
[01:42] <Cong> ActionParsnip, yep.
[01:43] <somsip> sagitta007: desktop or server?
[01:43] <sagitta007> somsip: desktop
=== chiluk is now known as chiluk_away
[01:43] <ActionParsnip> Cong: why not use a wired connection and move the laptop near the router....makes things waaaay easier
[01:43] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, are you comfortable with editing config files?
[01:43] <ActionParsnip> Cong: laptops have that mobility factor, dead handy
[01:44] <sagitta007> Sir_Fawnpug: No I just ditched Windows 8 for Ubuntu
[01:44] <somsip> sagitta007: this looks reasonable: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oV5qmOHjZk
[01:44] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, ahh, OK.
[01:44] <sagitta007> somsip: the issue with that is my interfaces has no etho it has lo which is god knows what
[01:44] <Sir_Fawnpug> I've never really done it any other way cause usually any time I need a static IP, it tends to be running on a machine that is headless anyway
[01:45] <Cong> ActionParsnip, do you have a list of the debs required, seems like a mighty big list.
[01:45] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, lo is the local loopback interface
[01:45] <somsip> sagitta007: is your connection over wifi or cable?
[01:45] <Sir_Fawnpug> It's something that exists mostly for testing the network stack
[01:45] <ActionParsnip> Cong: you'll have to see what the deb needs and what is installed now
[01:46] <sagitta007> somsip: right now using cale
[01:46] <ActionParsnip> Cong: the wired connection will make all this a tonne easier for you
[01:46] <sagitta007> Somsip: cable*
[01:46] <somsip> sagitta007: you connect to your router using a cable, and not a wifi connection?
[01:46] <sagitta007> Somsip: sometimes this sometimes that
[01:46] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, but you said you don't have an interface called eth0, yeah?
[01:47] <Ismailescu> how can i upgrade the libttf4 package ? :)
[01:47] <Ismailescu> in terminal
[01:47] <sagitta007> Sir_Fawnpug that is what has been bugging me when  u use a cable ur supposed to have eth)
[01:47] <sagitta007> *eth0
[01:48] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, what that usually means is that Ubuntu didn't see your network card
[01:48] <somsip> sagitta007: networking is not my strong point and Sir_Fawnpug seems to have this so I'm backing off
[01:48] <Sir_Fawnpug> Can you do a quick "lspci | grep -i "eth"?
[01:48] <sagitta007> Sir_Fawnpug what do I do now
[01:48] <sagitta007> ok
[01:48] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, what we're going to try is find the appropriate driver and get ubuntu to load it for you
[01:49] <sagitta007> Sir_Fawnpug 01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Broadcom Corporation NetLink BCM57780 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe (rev 01) was the feedback
[01:50] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, ahh, broadcom is always kinda finnicky when it comes to linux, let's see if we can find the appropriate driver
[01:51] <Sir_Fawnpug> Try "modprobe tg3"
[01:51] <Sir_Fawnpug> Note that you need to be root, so you may have to prepend that with sudo
[01:52] <BONG_IT_> can i downgrade apache2 to lower version
[01:52] <Sir_Fawnpug> BONG_IT, like apache 1.3?
[01:52] <sagitta007_> Sir Pawnpug:returned
[01:52] <Sir_Fawnpug> OK, do lsmod | grep "tg3"
[01:53] <Sir_Fawnpug> See if it says tg3 plus a couple of numbers
[01:53] <sagitta007_> SirPawnpug: tg3                   152032  0  is what my output was
[01:54] <Sir_Fawnpug> Excellent, now let's try lshw -C network, to see if your card is listed
[01:54] <magma> how can I see the user who copied some dirs of mine?
[01:55] <Sir_Fawnpug> magma, you mean like track whether or not your directory's been copied?
[01:55] <magma> Sir_Fawnpug: exactly
[01:55] <BONG_IT_> can i downgrade apache2 to lower version
[01:55] <Sir_Fawnpug> AFAIK you can't, but you can do something to prevent it
[01:55] <magma> Sir_Fawnpug: like what?
[01:55] <Sir_Fawnpug> BONG_IT_, what version are you wanting?
[01:56] <sagitta007_> Sir Fawnpug: PCI (sysfs)   SCSI                         *-network                description: Ethernet interface        product: NetLink BCM57780 Gigabit Ethernet PCIe        vendor: Broadcom Corporation        physical id: 0        bus info: pci@0000:01:00.0        logical name: eth0        version: 01        serial: 88:ae:1d:84:09:a6        size: 100Mbit/s        capacity: 1Gbit/s        width: 64 bits        clock: 33MHz       
[01:56] <BONG_IT_> 2.2.9
[01:56] <magma> Sir_Fawnpug: I can read the .bash of all user to see who used cp on my dirs. Byt through sftp there is nothing like that right
[01:56] <BONG_IT_> is there any pinoys here
[01:56] <Sir_Fawnpug> magma, oh, I think I understand. Maybe there's logs?
[01:57] <magma> that's what I'm trying to find
[01:57] <Sir_Fawnpug> Logs usually live in /var/log
[01:57] <sagitta007_> Sir Fawnpug: posting output
[01:57] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, pastebin is probably good if it's big output
[01:57] <sagitta007_> ok
[01:57] <decci> I am facing an issue installing Ubuntu 12.04 on compellent SAN. I did it for CentOS 6.3 and it went fine. here is the complete picture: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1508279/
[01:58] <Sir_Fawnpug> But yeah, your network card is assigned to eth0 now.
[01:58] <decci> When I try to install ubuntu 12.04. The installation cannot see the SAN storage device as shown http://tracker.webtechnologyfocused.com.au/ehw/volumesnotdetected.jpg
[01:58] <decci> I have attached lscsci output too..any idea what could be the fix?
[01:59] <sagitta007_> Sir Fawnpug: out put at http://pastebin.com/4ru7UZhj
[02:00] <KI4RO> .
[02:00] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, woah, looks like it has an IP address already!
[02:00] <KI4RO> Anyone figured out how to stop RHYTHMBOX?
[02:00] <Sir_Fawnpug> type ifconfig into your console and see if eth0 has been assigned anything
[02:01] <Sir_Fawnpug> KI4RO, you're trying to kill it?
[02:01] <sagitta007_> Sir Fawnpug affirmative
[02:01] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, fantastic!
[02:01] <BONG_IT_> how to setup static ip in ubuntu 12.04 LTS
[02:02] <sagitta007_> Sir Fawnpug I need a static Ip though
[02:02] <Jeremy3D> what's a good screen cast program for making video movies/tutorials?
[02:02] <Sir_Fawnpug> Now we need to make that persist
[02:02] <KI4RO> Sir_Fawnpug, I can kill it through System Monitor.  Just want it to stop normally when I close it
[02:02] <ActionParsnip> Jeremy3D: kazam, recordmydesktop
[02:02] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, well, the first part was getting your network card loaded
[02:02] <ActionParsnip> BONG_IT_: use network manager
[02:02] <Sir_Fawnpug> KI4RO, oh, I couldn't help you there, I've never used it.
[02:02] <Jeremy3D> ah i think i downloaded recordmydesktop at some point. got a preference ActionParsnip ?
[02:02] <sagitta007_> Sir Fawnpug let's do it
[02:02] <KI4RO> Sir_Fawnpug, Thanks any way
[02:02] <ActionParsnip> Jeremy3D: not really, try both
[02:03] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, before we set up the static IP we need to get ubuntu to automatically load up that module at boot time.
[02:03] <Sir_Fawnpug> But that's not hard. Just do nano -w /etc/modules, add a line with tg3, and hit ctrl-o
[02:03] <Sir_Fawnpug> If you do that then you won't have to do modprobe each time
[02:04] <BONG_IT_> can i use in /etc/network/interfaces
[02:04] <ActionParsnip> BONG_IT_: sure
[02:04] <Jeremy3D> ActionParsnip, 10-4, thank you
[02:05] <sagitta007_> Fawnpug at nano -w /etc/modules now what
[02:06] <sagitta007_> Fawnpug: very nervous with command line
[02:06] <Sir_Fawnpug> Did you add a line with tg3 in it?
[02:06] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, I understand; the command line can be a bit intimidating at first.
[02:06] <sagitta007_> Fawnpug tg3 affirmative
[02:06] <Sir_Fawnpug> OK, did you do ctrl-o?
[02:07] <WXZ> I just setup dual monitors on lucid, both VGA but one's connected with a DVI->VGA adapter, and the VGA one just blacks out when I get to the login screen
[02:07] <sagitta007_> fawnpug affirmative
[02:07] <Sir_Fawnpug> OK, now do ctrl-x
[02:08] <sagitta007_> Affirmative
[02:08] <Sir_Fawnpug> Now this is a system with a GUI, right?
[02:08] <sagitta007_> Fawnpug correct
[02:08] <Sir_Fawnpug> (brb, goign to smoke; I haven't left you)
[02:08] <Dunitek> Whats up?
[02:08] <sagitta007_> Fawnpug: I prefer a soda
[02:09] <sagitta007_> Dunitek: hello there
[02:09] <bilo> hi
[02:09] <sagitta007_> bilo: hi back
[02:09] <bilo> how are u?
[02:10] <sagitta007_> Bilo: splendid waiting for old fawnpug to finish his smoke
[02:10] <Dunitek> Splendid? :) Let me guess, Great Brittian?
[02:11] <sagitta007_> Bilo: First month with Ubuntu but have some windows Server experience
[02:11] <jwayne78> ls
[02:11] <sagitta007_> DuniteK: I am American, I assure you, dear fellow
[02:12] <bilo> i don't speack english very fast
[02:12] <bilo> :-)
[02:12] <Dunitek> Got ya! Just curious
[02:12] <bilo> but i use xubuntu
[02:12] <Sir_Fawnpug> I thought I might add that my roommate makes grown men cry when she cookies. The house smells wonderful.
[02:12] <Dunitek> Does anyone else here hate Unity?
[02:12] <sagitta007_> Dunitek: I miss the old GNOME
[02:12] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, so I've never done it this way but you're using Unity, right?
[02:12] <alexhairyman> sagitta007_, have you seen MATE?
[02:13] <Sir_Fawnpug> Dunitek, I swear by fluxbox myself
[02:13] <sagitta007_> alexhairyman no man sorry
[02:13] <bilo> guys?
[02:13] <WXZ> I just setup dual monitors on lucid, both VGA but one's connected with a DVI->VGA adapter, and the VGA one just blacks out when I get to the login screen
[02:13] <alexhairyman> sagitta007_, it's a gnome 2 fork that carries on the legacy
[02:13] <Dunitek> Nice, I always remove unity and log in to classic. Why Fluxbox, what is so great about it in your opinion?
[02:13] <sagitta007_> Fawnpug: affirmative
[02:13] <bilo> how i can put your name first in the dialogue
[02:13] <bilo> ?
[02:13] <Sir_Fawnpug> WXZ, what's driving the heads?
[02:14] <WXZ> Sir_Fawnpug: I don't even know what that means
[02:14] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007_, OK, then hit System->Preferences->Network Settings
[02:14] <Sir_Fawnpug> WXZ, what kind of video card do you have? Sorry, long day at work.
[02:14] <WXZ> Sir_Fawnpug: it's a radeon hd 5450, do you want the GPU?
[02:15] <sagitta007_> fawnpug: Unity 2D man in the words of DOS No such file or directory
[02:15] <Sir_Fawnpug> It should be right next to "Places"
[02:15] <Sir_Fawnpug> http://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/09/setup-permanent-static-ip-address-ubuntu-10-0410-10-maverick-meerkat/
[02:15] <Sir_Fawnpug> Granted this is from a while back
[02:15] <ActionParsnip> Dunitek: fluxbox is easy to configure and light
[02:15] <Sir_Fawnpug> ActionParsnip, I've thought about checking E17 out lately
[02:16] <WXZ> Sir_Fawnpug: it's a radeon hd 5450 graphics card
[02:16] <Dunitek> ActionParsnip, I will have to try it and see.
[02:17] <BONG_IT_> i have a problem in loading of webserver
[02:17] <Sir_Fawnpug> WXZ, for radeon cards, I couldn't tell you; I'm an NVidia user.
[02:17] <BONG_IT_> how can i paste the logs here
[02:17] <WXZ> oh, darn
[02:17] <Dunitek> BONG IT, Paste Bin?
[02:17] <Sir_Fawnpug> ~pastebin
[02:17] <Sir_Fawnpug> Err, ~pastebin

[02:18] <Dunitek> Thumbs up! ^
[02:18] <Sir_Fawnpug> I finally got it. I should be proud of myself.
[02:18] <bilo> i can'
[02:18] <bilo> ?
[02:18] <sagitta007> fawnpug: can you walk me through the setup
[02:19] <bilo> a question
[02:19] <BONG_IT_> yes pastebin
[02:19] <bilo> someone can help me?
[02:19] <sagitta007> o.o
[02:19] <sagitta007> im here
[02:19] <sagitta007> I havent d/c
[02:19] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, I need to do a little research because I usually do this through the config files
[02:19] <bilo> sagitta?
[02:20] <sagitta007> bilo English only
[02:20] <SuperMiguel> how do i do fake raid installs on new ubuntu?
[02:20] <bilo> yes but i'm not speack fluently
[02:20] <sagitta007> bilo now whats the problem
[02:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> WXZ, are you a new GNU/Linux user? I found a link that you might find instructive.
[02:20] <BONG_IT_> i have a problem in apache2 http://paste.ubuntu.com/1508318/
[02:20] <bilo> i have a problem with my xubuntu
[02:20] <WXZ> Sir_Fawnpug: whatever the case with what graphics card you have, generally you have to install a driver, correct?
[02:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> WXZ, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
[02:20] <BONG_IT_> im using 12.04
[02:21] <Sir_Fawnpug> WXZ, well, not always; the proprietary drivers sometimes have their own way of doing things.
[02:21] <Sir_Fawnpug> Like NVidia has TwinView for that purpose
[02:21] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: I smoke cigars once a while hbu?
[02:21] <Dunitek> BONG_IT, Your PHP Script runs only on PHP4
[02:21] <Dunitek> OR PHP 5.2 or lower
[02:21] <bilo> :-(
[02:21] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, I smoke cigarettes way too frequently for my own good.
[02:22] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, I haven't forgotten about you, BTW
[02:22] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: a large cigar a month is all I do
[02:22] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, but I did find this: http://www.sudo-juice.com/how-to-a-set-static-ip-in-ubuntu/
[02:22] <Sir_Fawnpug> Sometimes I like to smoke a pipe, but I don't do it all that often.
[02:23] <DaemeonZane> Need some help. I'm uding WUBI to install 12.10, and I've gotten hung up. Output is as follows: ubuntu kernel: [840.440194]  [<c15d04fe>] kernel_thread_helper+0x6/0x10
[02:23] <DaemeonZane> *using
[02:23] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: own a wood pipe with a bowl
[02:23] <BONG_IT_> how can i lower my php sir
[02:23] <somsip> Dunitek: seems like the error is not the deprecations, but the missing mcrypt and pdo plugin BONG_IT_
[02:24] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: weaned myself onto herbal leaves
[02:24] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, on the rare occasion that I do, I usually smoke black cavendish.
[02:24] <BONG_IT_> what can i do somsip
[02:24] <DaemeonZane> Black Cavendish is good stuff
[02:24] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, haha, I dont think I will ask.
[02:24] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: not what you think its mint
[02:24] <somsip> BONG_IT_: install them - php5-mcrypt and php5-pdo-mysql (possibly)
[02:25] <BONG_IT_> whats the exact comman sir
[02:25] <Sir_Fawnpug> That sounds like a peculiar kind of smoke if you ask me.
[02:25] <somsip> BONG_IT_: or php5-mysql (assuming it is mysql)
[02:25] <BONG_IT_> or should i lower my php5?
[02:25] <SuperMiguel> there is no alternate install on 12.10 for fake raid??
[02:25] <somsip> BONG_IT_: you can but it's simpler to just install what is needed
[02:25] <Sir_Fawnpug> DaemeonZane, a british colleague of mine got me started on it.
[02:25] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: Just survived a lung transfer I need to get off and I am doing well
[02:26] <Dunitek> BONG_IT, somsip is suggesting that you run "sudo apt-get install php5-mcrypt php5-pdo-mysql php5-mysql"
[02:26] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, i'm glad to hear the transfer went well.
[02:26] <Dunitek> If this fails maybe you should reinstall LAMP
[02:26] <somsip> Dunitek: BONG_IT_ yeah, but I think i was wrong with php5-pdo-mysql.
[02:26] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, anyway, you might find this link useful: http://www.sudo-juice.com/how-to-a-set-static-ip-in-ubuntu/
[02:26] <Sir_Fawnpug> Let's see if ubottu has anything on the subject
[02:26] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: apparently I have a twin unlike many  people and his lung proved useful
[02:27] <Sir_Fawnpug> !static-ip
[02:27] <BONG_IT_> ok theres an error to download the php5-mcrypt
[02:27] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, alternately, does your router let you set up static leases?
[02:27] <somsip> BONG_IT_: much better if you tell us what it is
[02:28] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: No clue to what you said, but Static constantly changes IP right?
[02:28] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, no, that is dynamic.
[02:28] <Sir_Fawnpug> Static means that your IP remainss constant
[02:29] <Sir_Fawnpug> If you want a dynamic IP, then you're more or less done.
[02:29] <sagitta007> Fawnpug: I feel like leaping into the english channel
[02:29] <BONG_IT_> heres the error http://paste.ubuntu.com/1508327/
[02:29] <Sir_Fawnpug> This is the official english channel, right?
[02:29] <BONG_IT_> when i dowloaded php5-mycrypt
[02:29] <ActionParsnip> Sir_Fawnpug: sure, right between england and france
[02:29] <sagitta007> Fawnpug the one off London
[02:29] <seednode> Hue

[02:30] <Sir_Fawnpug> sagitta007, you don't mind your IP changing, right?
[02:30] <Sir_Fawnpug> If you don't, then you're more or less done.
[02:31] <Sir_Fawnpug> If (for some reason) you want your IP address to stay the same, then there's more to do.

[02:35] <somsip> wbf: more details would help
[02:36] <BONG_IT_> do u have repo
[02:36] <wbf> somsip: where do I put .o files so I can modprobe them?
[02:36] <sagitta007_> Fawnpug: I am back
[02:37] <somsip> wbf: you may need to research more, but the answer is in 'man modprobe'
[02:38] <tripelb> No question, just sharing. No matter how many times I warned and hinted, I got the disk burned as one is file. Then sent emails explaining and they were ignored. Got a reply, how did that disk work for you. Really being nice, sent another and explained what to see when the disk is done. No response yet. Tears out one or two hairs.

[02:38] <somsip> BONG_IT_: ok - looks like noone can help you right now with the repo change, but installing php5-mcrypt and php5-mysql should help you, even if you have to wait until you can access your usual repo. Ask me later if you still have problems with the PHP
[02:38] <sagitta007_> *seeing
[02:38] <sagitta007_> somsip: Where's Fawnpug
[02:39] <somsip> sagitta007_: that's not a constructive question
[02:39] <sagitta007_> somsip: how can one override an IP ban
[02:40] <somsip> sagitta007_: please don't ask me questions unless I'm already helping you. I have work to do and just come on here for a few minutes now and then.
[02:41] <BONG_IT_> should i install php5-mcrypt also?

[02:45] <Greyfox__> I am having trouble booting ubuntu from the disc. Just a black screen with a blinking cursor pops up. What's wrong.
[02:45] <goddard> my wifi disconnects when under heavy load
[02:46] <goddard> for long periods of time
[02:46] <goddard> is that normal?
[02:46] <goddard> how can i figure out if its my wifi card or my router
[02:46] <dr_willis> try a different card...
[02:46] <revickulous2001> or try a different router
[02:47] <dr_willis> !nomoseset | Greyfox__
[02:47] <BONG_IT_> ok
[02:47] <dr_willis> !nomodeset | Greyfox__
[02:47] <ubottu> Greyfox__: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[02:48] <goddard> ive been using rync for like 300gb of data
[02:48] <goddard> tried ssh at first that didn't work so well
[02:50] <dr_willis> just 300 gb?
[02:50] <dr_willis> how tiny.
[02:51] <dniMretsaM> so I'm using SSH to forward X and I'm trying to get it to use ssh-askpass to get the password for the remote machine. how to I go about accomplishing this?
[02:51] <seednode> I've never ussed ssh-askpass
[02:51] <SolarisBoy> i use agent forwarding and keybased access its easier
[02:51] <dniMretsaM> the command I using is this: xinit /usr/bin/ssh -XY user@machine lxsession -- :1
[02:51] <SolarisBoy> if you can ofcourse.
[02:52] <BONG_IT_> how to unlock the dpkg im installing right now the php5-mycrypt
[02:52] <BONG_IT_> how can i see the process
[02:52] <wbf> I'm angry. there's no way to get my network card working on my other computer
[02:53] <goddard> dr_willis: doing it over wifi was a dumb idea
[02:53] <SolarisBoy> +1
[02:53] <memand> wbf: did you try yelling ?
[02:53] <dniMretsaM> SolarisBoy: It seems overkill to set all that up for one machine, but I guess I could
[02:53] <dr_willis> rsync should be able to resume the syncing
[02:53] <wbf> memand: No and I don't want to
[02:54] <memand> :)
[02:54] <wbf> memand: can you help me?
[02:54] <memand> No, sorry
[02:54] <SolarisBoy> dniMretsaM: you could try ssh-copy-id and copy your key to the target if it allows for that type of auth - it would be a one time password thing
[02:55] <wbf> who knows about wired usb network cards?
[02:55] <memand> I can actually see I have to go to bed since I'm blurting unhelpful sarcasm ;) have a nice night wbf
[02:55] <Sir_Fawnpug> wbf, I'm angry too; I had a NIC die on me and I'm having to replace it now
[02:55] <dniMretsaM> SolarisBoy: my key has it's own passphrase, so that wouldn't help
[02:55] <SolarisBoy> heh
[02:56] <goddard> i have another hard drive on my laptop can I use it to do some kind of raid?
[02:56] <Sir_Fawnpug> wbf, I think net is standardized like audio or storage
[02:56] <Sir_Fawnpug> For USB
[02:56] <Sir_Fawnpug> But i'm not entirely certain
[02:57] <wbf> Sir_Fawnpug, can you please help my ny net card is an F5D5050 and I need to get it running

[03:02] <yomi> could someone list the contents of the default sudoers file?
[03:02] <magma> Where is the log that stores authentication information?
[03:02] <somsip> magma: /var/log/auth
[03:03] <magma> thanks
[03:03] <magma> somsip: and do you know where is logged SFTP information?
[03:03] <somsip> magma: never used it. Sorry
[03:04] <SolarisBoy> dniMretsaM: if the prompt is your issue you can either set up key based access (without a passcode thought thats secure it defeats your prompt issue cause), or you can create a wrapper that uses expect or a similar library to await the prompt and enter the data you require - however if you say setting up keys is overkill thats possibly assasination
[03:05] <magma> somsip: is it safe to delete the auth.log?
[03:06] <Sir_Fawnpug> magma, yeah, it's just a log
[03:06] <dniMretsaM> SolarisBoy: my main goal is to ask for the password on my end and thus open only the remote X session. usually, it pops up an xterm window to ask for the authentication
[03:06] <somsip> magma: I've never done that. You might find that syslog (whatever) stops logging auth entries until you reboot though
[03:06] <Sir_Fawnpug> Yeah, somsip has a good point.
[03:06] <dniMretsaM> but maybe I'm going about this in the wrong way. any other thoughts?
[03:06] <BONG_IT_> phpinfo() as in i write this command
[03:06] <Sir_Fawnpug> I've to ask, bTW, is that a reference to the self organizing map?
[03:06] <magma> somsip: you mean that the log is deleted on reboot?
[03:07] <somsip> BONG_IT_: Enter the PHP interactive shell (php -a) and call the phpinfo function (with 'phpinfo();)') but if you're asking this, you might have a long difficult journey to get this working and that is going to go way OT
[03:07] <Sir_Fawnpug> magma, what he may mean is that syslog may cease to function until you reboot
[03:07] <somsip> magma: I'm guessing, but I think it's fair to expect that to happen
[03:08] <Sir_Fawnpug> magma, without getting into too much detail I'm not sure what happens if you delete a file with an open file descriptor
[03:08] <BONG_IT_> heres the error when i restart my apache2 http://paste.ubuntu.com/1508387/
[03:08] <somsip> BONG_IT_: never seen that before. You'll need to look it up. I'm not doing that dfor you
[03:09] <Sir_Fawnpug> magma, I would expect syslog to crash though

[03:16] <moes> ActionParsnip, Okay thanks
[03:16] <ActionParsnip> moes: what were you expecting to see when you opened it?
[03:17] <moes> ActionParsnip, The changes I have made to the o/s
[03:17] <ActionParsnip> moes: in what form, a pictur?
[03:18] <moes> ActionParsnip, Just any kind of a display
[03:18] <kslater> why is my load factor so high on Ubuntu desktop 12.04.1?
[03:19] <Sir_Fawnpug> kslater, are you running a bunch of programs at once?
[03:19] <kslater> uh, not that I know of
[03:19] <wbf> Sir_Fawnpug, I have a belkin f5d5050
[03:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> kslater, load average is essentially a measure of how many programs the kernel didn't get around to executing in a given timeslice
[03:20] <WXZ> everytime I uncheck the box which says "same image in all monitors" and restart, it just goes back to being checked.
[03:20] <Sir_Fawnpug> So a high load average indicates that some program is hogging a lot of CPU time
[03:20] <kslater> jbd2 seems to be doing a fair bit of io according to iotop
[03:21] <Sir_Fawnpug> Well, IO usually causes a program to sleep
[03:21] <Sir_Fawnpug> WZX, try modprobe usbnet
[03:21] <moes> ActionParsnip, I found the info telling me size used left by using df -h Thanks
[03:22] <kslater> looks like pidgin is at least part of the culprit. I'll be back.
[03:22] <Tr3nT> so i want to use ubuntu for my OS and run a media center like XBMC. i want to but a remote and usb for control. any ideas ?????????
[03:22] <wbf> Tr3nT, you need LIRC
[03:22] <Tr3nT> i will google lirc
[03:23] <Tr3nT> na
[03:23] <Sir_Fawnpug> kslater, pidgin should be fairly I/O bound unless there's a serious bug in it, which could be the case
[03:23] <Tr3nT> my friends use xbmc without any lirc
[03:23] <Tr3nT> they all use ubuntu
[03:23] <Tr3nT> with a mce remote
[03:24] <Tr3nT> i will ask them
[03:24] <wbf> yeah MCE, but what remote do you have?
[03:24] <Tr3nT> i have 14 remotes
[03:24] <Tr3nT> maybe more
[03:24] <Tr3nT> all windows
[03:24] <Tr3nT> i work at a pc shop
[03:24] <Sir_Fawnpug> kslater, it might help to install valgrind on your machine. You can use that to do code profiling.
[03:24] <Sir_Fawnpug> Keep in mind that valgrind slows things down A LOT though.
[03:25] <Tr3nT> i get all this stuff free so i want to build a media pc
[03:26] <Tr3nT> i have a P5K-E mobo with a Q6600 cpu , GT9800 gpu , 8TB of HDD space
[03:26] <Tr3nT> 6gb of ram
[03:26] <Tr3nT> 1000Watt psu
[03:26] <Tr3nT> and thats all
[03:27] <wbf> Tr3nT, if you don't have A MCE remote your gonna need lirc
[03:27] <Tr3nT> i have 14 mce remotes
[03:27] <Tr3nT> all diffirent ones
[03:27] <wbf> Tr3nT, do they work or not, if they don't, use LIRC
[03:27] <wbf> Tr3nT, sudo apt-get install lirc
[03:27] <Tr3nT> they are all working
[03:28] <wbf> Tr3nT, do they work with XBMC?
[03:28] <Tr3nT> they work on windows on xbmc
[03:28] <wbf> Tr3nT, sudo apt-get install xbmc
[03:28] <Tr3nT> not tried ubuntu
[03:28] <wbf> Tr3nT, this is UBUNTU help...
[03:28] <Tr3nT> i have 3 remotes that have the keyboard under it
[03:29] <Tr3nT> i want to use ubuntu as my OS
[03:29] <Tr3nT> im installing ubunto now
[03:30] <wbf> Tr3nT, if you still want windows click install alongside
[03:30] <Tr3nT> no
[03:30] <Tr3nT> i dont

[03:38] <Sna4x8> Anyone used php5-mysqlnd (mysql native driver) in 12.04?  http://pastebin.com/EcYm2PQ9  segfaults for me if I change line 11 to false.
[03:40] <somsip> Sna4x8: should the $conStr be difference to use mysqlnd?
[03:40] <somsip> *different
[03:40] <Sna4x8> Don't think so, no, at least that throws a "Driver not found" exception.
[03:41] <ProfesorDavis> maybe i doing this wrong, but how come i cant do ls /volumes to check my volumes through terminal on Ubuntu?
[03:41] <Sna4x8> At any rate, with php5-mysql it works, but if I apt-get install php5-mysqlnd the same code segfaults.
[03:42] <somsip> Sna4x8: Not finding anything specific except ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES appears to default to 1 anyway
[03:43] <Sna4x8> somsip: Yea, I want to set it to false.  My code works fine if I leave it true.
[03:44] <Sna4x8> When it's set to false, fetch(PDO::FETCH_CLASS) will return native db types, which I want (i.e. MySQL integer columns come back as ints).
[03:45] <somsip> Sna4x8: ah - misleading pastebin. looks like this might tell you something given 'will not work with the follwiong set to 0" http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6346674/pdo-support-for-multiple-queries-pdo-mysql-pdo-mysqlnd
=== dayangkun_ is now known as dayangkun
[03:47] <kslater> couldn't pin down what the cause of the high load factor is
[03:47] <Sna4x8> somsip: But that's just for multiple statements.  I don't need (or want) to allow multiple statements to be executed.
[03:47] <kslater> wasn't pidgin. could be chrome I suppose.
[03:48] <kslater> dual core and neither is executing about 20% or so
[03:48] <Sna4x8> Besides, I disagree with that so.  mysqlnd is native as of php 5.4 AFAIK (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/php-mysqlnd/ <-- some backup for that).
[03:48] <somsip> Sna4x8: K. I'm just searching, so maybe you need someone else
[03:48] <Sna4x8> Word, I appreciate you help!
[03:50] <somsip> Sna4x8: have you seen the bug reports that relate to this? eg: http://grokbase.com/t/php/php-bugs/123gyvbnpb/php-bug-bug-61411-new-pdo-segfaults-with-persistent-true-emulate-prepares-false
[03:50] <jordan_> hello all
[03:51] <Sna4x8> Hrm, I haven't seen that one.  I did post on one bug report, but it's old (although unresolved).
[03:51] <somsip> Sna4x8: in a search I got a few, that seemed most relevant but I didn't read through for a solution
[03:51] <tompa> Hello
[03:52] <Sna4x8> That pretty much sums up the issue I'm having: persistent + !emulate_prepares = segfault with invalid pointer.
[03:53] <jordan_> exit
[03:53] <Sna4x8> *grumbles*.  I suppose the solution is use the standard php-mysql driver and do the type conversions in my code.
[03:54] <kslater> hmm. Maybe my load factor was due to my-weather-indicator?

[03:56] <wbf> bye everyone
[03:56] <tompa> 12.10
[03:56] <pbwizkid> may have been taken out of repos
[03:57] <pbwizkid> google for the repo and add it or use ubuntu tweak i personaly find it better
[03:57] <SuperMiguel> so after i install ubuntu 12.04 using the alternate disc how do i install a window manager? the default one?
[03:57] <tompa> pbwizkid can you shrink the unity bar with ubunu tweak?
[03:58] <pbwizkid> yes, you can only go down to 32 pix vut thats all you can do with myunity
[03:58] <pbwizkid> ubuntu tweak will do all myunity will plus some other usefull tools

[04:00] <dr_willis> SuperMiguel:  or just install the ubuntu-desktop package
[04:00] <ActionParsnip> SuperMiguel: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop    will install a default Ubuntu UI
[04:00] <SuperMiguel> dr_willis: should i update to 12.10 before i do that?
[04:00] <SuperMiguel> ActionParsnip: dr_willis i installed 12.04 because i needed raid
[04:01] <dr_willis> SuperMiguel:  if its a clean install. i would have suggested installing 12.10 directly
[04:01] <SuperMiguel> dr_willis: 12.10 doesn't have an alternate disc
[04:02] <dr_willis> SuperMiguel:  and why do you need the alternative disk>
[04:02] <SuperMiguel> fake raid
[04:02] <dr_willis> You sure the 12.10 desktop cd cant do that?  I avoid raid. ;)
[04:03] <ActionParsnip> SuperMiguel: I'd stick with Precise, it is LTS supported
[04:03] <SuperMiguel> Precise is 12.04

[04:21] <charlycode> SuperMiguel: Lo reinstalastes con pendrive o cd-rom o con que? para ver si la imagen no estaba dañada,
[04:21] <bazhang> charlycode, english here
[04:22] <rohitkav> Hi Team, I got EeePc, with Ubuntu 12.04, I wanted to install LXDE
[04:22] <dr_willis> rohitkav:  lubuntu-desktop package is lxde
[04:22] <bazhang> rohitkav, lubuntu-desktop package will do that
[04:23] <rohitkav> if install it using Software package manager does that works or should I download and install
[04:23] <dr_willis> download from where? :)
[04:23] <dr_willis> The package manager tools are there for a reason.
[04:23] <rohitkav> software package manager
[04:23] <bazhang> !purelxde | rohitkav
[04:23] <ubottu> rohitkav: If you want to remove all !KDE, !GNOME and !XFCE packages and have a default !Lubuntu system follow the instructions here « http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purelxde »
[04:23] <dr_willis> it downloads it for you
[04:24] <rohitkav> but it won't remove the unity environment right dr_willis
[04:24] <dr_willis> rohitkav:  of course not. ;) you dident tell it to remove anything
[04:24] <rohitkav> I was going through a youtube video wherein he talks about using software package manger
[04:24] <dr_willis> theres no real need to remove unity
[04:24] <rohitkav> to install lxde
[04:25] <dr_willis> all the package manager tools do the same job.
[04:25] <dr_willis> They are front ends to the apt system
[04:25] <dr_willis> !apt
[04:25] <ubottu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome), !Muon (KDE) or !Apper (KDE)
[04:25] <rohitkav> oh, will it not affect the performance having unity and using lxde
[04:25] <rohitkav> or is it good to have only lxde
[04:25] <dr_willis> unity wont be running at the same time.. so no.
[04:26] <SuperMiguel> charlycode: did that and now it gets stock at the ubuntu logo screen (one with 5 dots under it)
[04:26] <rohitkav> usage of space? any issue
[04:26] <dr_willis> Unless you are just obsessive with having drive space. ;)
[04:26] <rohitkav> no right dr_willis
[04:26] <dr_willis> lubuntu-desktopp may take up another 300mb..  thats trivial these days
[04:27] <rohitkav> hmm but that seam bit issue for me right now :D
[04:27] <rohitkav> I got 160gb though
[04:27] <rohitkav> get 100 gb for ubuntu while installing 12.04
[04:28] <dr_willis> I got a 128gb ssd with my Ubuntu system with several desktops.
[04:28] <rohitkav> but this environment however its good, but seamed too sluggish
[04:28] <dr_willis> the OS is the smallest space user on my systems. ;P
[04:28] <rohitkav> :)
[04:28] <afk9125> ubuntu sucks, INSTALL GENTOO
[04:28] <rohitkav> I am ok with ubuntu afk9125
[04:28] <dr_willis> I will pass on troll reccomendations thank you..
[04:29] <bazhang> afk9125, wrong channel
[04:29] <dr_willis> !info gentoo
[04:29] <ubottu> gentoo (source: gentoo): fully GUI-configurable, two-pane X file manager. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.19.13-2 (quantal), package size 755 kB, installed size 1906 kB
[04:29] <afk9125> INSTALL GENTOO, DO IT FAGET
[04:29] <dr_willis> just to confuse people more. ;)
[04:29] <Aphro> lol
[04:29] <sebsebseb> hi
[04:29] <rohitkav> I have used almost many distributions afk9125 , and at present situation ubuntu is best, and it depends on your personal choice
[04:30] <dr_willis> the troll has left the channel rohitkav
[04:30] <rohitkav> :D
[04:30] <rohitkav> yes dr_willis
[04:31] <ActionParsnip> people going on about gentoo in this day and age
[04:31] <rohitkav> so as you said I can just get that lxde envi and get it working than downloading again and installing isn't dr_jesus
[04:31] <ActionParsnip> jeez
[04:31] <rohitkav> oops dr_willis
[04:31] <rohitkav> :D ActionParsnip
[04:31] <dr_willis> rohitkav:  you can install several dozen (well about half a dozen) desktop enviroments on your base Ubuntu install. and select the one to use at the Login screen.
[04:32] <dr_willis> Try them all out see what you like. Theres no need to hurry up and uninstall stuff unless your hd space is critically low
[04:32] <sebsebseb> hi  LadySoph
[04:32] <dr_willis> KDE,lxde,xfce, Enlightment, and then thers other stranger window managers, and alternative interfaces. ;)
[04:34] <rohitkav> hmm ok.. with LXDE since I used it, enlightment is good, xfce is ok, kde i am not so fond though, but is nice :) I wish we get something so simple and elegant and less CPU usage from upcoming release :) dr_willis

[04:35] <RagnaRok__> Anyone been having problems with the "indicator-weather", i've noticed it doesn't refresh the temperature anymore..
[04:36] <animebsd> Ive got a odd question.   how do i get the system tab back on gnome classic on ubuntu 12.10?  its annoying to see it in the apps
[04:38] <sinistrad> I'm trying to get raid1 working after a re-install. It was working before, but now /dev/sdxx isn't seen by mdadm, but fdisk -l shows it.

[04:41] <Daxter> Hey is there a way to get GRUB2 to boot OSes located on a external HDD hooked via USB 3.0?
[04:41] <dr_willis> Daxter:  it may depend on the usb3 controller  and if its a external card or not.
[04:42] <dr_willis> I  think i can boot my usb3 drives same as any other hd.
[04:42] <Daxter> It's internal to the MB. Early NEC controller I presume, the board is circa 2010
[04:42] <dr_willis> other pc has a addon usb3 card. it cant boot from them
[04:44] <csmith1994> this is gonna be awkward but my computer froze up before and i missed if anyone responded to me. can anyone tell me how to get an iphone 5 working with rhythmbox?
[04:46] <csmith1994> is anyone even actually there?
[04:46] <animebsd> Ive got a odd question.   how do i get the system tab back on gnome classic on ubuntu 12.10?  its annoying to see it in the apps
[04:47] <ActionParsnip> csmith1994: none at all
[04:47] <ActionParsnip> animebsd: install gnome-panel, log off and log in to the new session
[04:48] <hot2trot> for some reason, my wifi doesn't show up in the tray, even though I have wifi, and I don't even know where to start to fix it
[04:48] <ActionParsnip> hot2trot: is nm-applet running?
[04:49] <animebsd> i did that,  im already in gnome classic with the panel and all. but the top panel has the system settings under applications tab.  i want it under its own tab on the panel. just like it used to be before they added unity
[04:49] <hot2trot> ActionParsnip:  yes sir
[04:49] <xangua> animebsd: get a time machine and live in the past, there is no go back to gnome2

[04:51] <Guest58726> hi
[04:51] <ActionParsnip> animebsd: there are unofficial forks but they are not supported here
[04:51] <Guest58726> yes
[04:51] <Guest58726> how r u ?
[04:52] <animebsd> does xubuntu have all the hardware support ubuntu does?   i have a brand spankin new toshiba that only has drivers for windows 8(lame os) and conveniently ubuntu had em all  its touch screen and all
[04:53] <Hacym> HI there
[04:53] <Daxter> Does anyone have a solution for my question? dr_willis, a little more explanation on your answer?
[04:53] <Hacym> animebsd -- I'm not sure to the answer of that, but in my experience plain Ubuntu seems to work with more hardware than Xubuntu. For example, Xubuntu does not support the backlighting on my laptop's keyboard but Ubuntu does.
[04:54] <aeon-ltd> animebsd: yes/no, modules are all across linux. so you can load any you need. are they there by default ? maybe in some versions
[04:54] <ActionParsnip> animebsd: its only the desktop that is different, the underlying OS is 100% identical
[04:54] <animebsd> Blehhh i just miss the old gnome lol.  unity is way differant.  perhaps i can get used to it or some other enviroments
[04:55] <ActionParsnip> animebsd: only the DE, WM and default apps are different, but you can run any Gnome app in XFCE you wish (or KDE etc)
[04:55] <ActionParsnip> animebsd: Unity doesn't replace Gnome
[04:55] <ActionParsnip> animebsd: Unity is a shell for Gnome, Gnome is still running
[04:55] <Hacym> animebsd, installing a traditional gnome intereface is fairly simple.
[04:56] <animebsd> ive already done that i was just wondering about the system tab on the top panel

[05:01] <BONG_IT_> why my nameserver inside my Etc/resolv.conf has been erase when i restart my computer
[05:02] <dr_willis> I belive the top of resolv.conf mentions its managed by some service. (i forget the name)
[05:03] <afk9125> INSTALL GENTOO
[05:05] <ActionParsnip> BONG_IT_: the file is generated by network manager
[05:07] <BONG_IT_> how can i edit the network manager
[05:07] <BONG_IT_> for me to able to hardcode it
[05:07] <ActionParsnip> BONG_IT_: use the app in the tray, or you can use the config files
[05:08] <dr_willis> what are you wanting to change exactly?
[05:08] <luis_> Hey!, i have a little problem with conky in ubuntu studio, how can i do to make conky start automatically?
[05:09] <sinistrad> BONG_IT_: Or you can try ifconfig or iwconfig. Be careful with those, as they can make a mess of your network config if you aren't careful
[05:09] <dr_willis> luis_:  conky faq/docs mention making a script in ~/.config/autostart (or autorun) to launch it after a 20 sec delay

[05:14] <UnderControl> I get the error "(initramfs) Unable to find a medium containing a live file system"
[05:16] <dr_willis> sounds like either the image was bad, or the burn was bad.. or its having other issues

[05:19] <mail323> How can I disable the firewall and enable SSH access in ubuntu? I' ve done the apt-get install openssh-server, service ufw disable, service ssh enable but now I can only ssh from the local machine and not from any other
[05:20] <Hacym> mail323 do you have port 22 forwarded on your router
[05:20] <mail323> Hacym: Yes but I can't ssh even from within the lan, only from the ubuntu machine itself
[05:21] <dr_willis> mail323:  sudo iptables --list will show if any rules are still rnning for the firewall
[05:21] <dr_willis> theres no rules by default.

[05:34] <wajeemba> Hello all, I'm trying to understand the dd command better- I need to move the contents of one partition to another. What will happen if the partition I'm copying to is larger than the one copied from? Will that space be lost outside the filesystem, or will it become free space? OR, would I be able to recover the space using a cfdisk maximize command?

[05:35] <dr_willis> wajeemba:  it will work. but to use all the space. you will need to resize the filesystem with gparted (or other tools)
[05:35] <dr_willis> wajeemba:  going to a smaller partion.. is trickier. ;)
[05:36] <wajeemba> dr_willis: I only have command line running atm- I'm assuming an equivalent resizing command can be done using cfdisk?
[05:37] <Haematoma> what is the path directory for similar to /usr/bin for individual users? I think its inside the home directory, but can't remember

[05:40] <luis_> im talking about the conky stuff
[05:40] <luis_> excuse me, but im new in this world of ubuntu
[05:41] <luis_> how can i create the document to start automatically the conky?#
[05:41] <dr_willis> luis_:  you make a script in ~/.config/autorun you mean? (or was it autostart?)
[05:42] <dr_willis> the conky faq i think gives an example. 3 lines ->   #!/bin/bash   sleep 30    conky &
[05:42] <luis_> yes, but where i find that document or file?
[05:42] <dr_willis> you make it...
[05:42] <dr_willis> in your .config/autowhatever/ directory
[05:43] <raphzthename> anyone at all?
[05:43] <dr_willis> You might want to spend an hr or so reading up on bash basics and text editing of config files - because configuring conky is going to be a challange if  making a simple script is confuseing to you.
[05:43] <luis_> oh!, in that folder i may create the script!
[05:44] <luis_> right?
[05:44] <dr_willis> luis_:  yes. its a directory of scripts/.desktop files and stuf fthats get ran onlogin

[05:44] <raphzthename> oh i'm sorry, i'm trying to install 12.04 on a macbook pro
[05:45] <dr_willis> THeres mostlikely a forum thread or 100 on installing on macbooks. I dont own one. so no idea
[05:45] <dr_willis> askubuntu.com may also have pointers to guides and things to look out for

[05:46] <JC_Yang> hi, all. I need help change the console resolution of ubuntu server, I google and get this post: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1467946#5, is this still the solution for ubuntu server 12.04? There is no menu.lst in my /boot/grub/ directory, do I have to create one?
[05:46] <lauratika> what is your ram?
[05:47] <raphzthename> i read in a few places that it runs really hot, so i was hoping y'all would have insight on how i might adjust the fans, etc. once it's installed
[05:47] <raphzthename> or if someone wants to help me through the process, that'd be great too
[05:47] <raphzthename> i tried to install debian a while back and it wouldn't take on my machine
[05:47] <barismetin> JC_Yang: try /boot/grub/grub.cfg
[05:48] <luis_> ok, im in the folder yet, now, what i have to do to make the  script, and what i i have to write in that?
[05:48] <raphzthename> @lauratika i have 8gb ram
[05:48] <barismetin> does anyone know if there is 3.8 port for bcmwl wireless driver?
[05:49] <dr_willis> the conky faq i think gives an example. 3 lines ->   #!/bin/bash   sleep 30    conky &
[05:49] <dr_willis> luis_:  if you really want to learn to use conky. a read of its docs/website/faq/guides will be needed.
[05:49] <JC_Yang> barismetin: do you mean the solution in the post is no longer valid? any more specific instructions?
[05:50] <luis_> mm, ok
[05:50] <barismetin> JC_Yang: I didn't follow the link, I just read that you're having trouble finding menu.lst.
[05:50] <ActionParsnip> JC_Yang: you change it in /etc/default/grub   which will then go into grub.cfg when update-grub gets ran
[05:50] <lauratika> raphzthename: i installed on mac with 2gb an run pretty good... it wasnt 12.04 though but im pretty sure it will make no difference}
[05:51] <lauratika> unless someone knows otherwise
[05:51] <barismetin> menu.lst is generally linked to grub configuration anyway. (I'm a new ubuntu user but that's the case for many distibutions)
[05:51] <raphzthename> thanks @lauratika, i'll give it a spin
[05:51] <StepNjump> I was wondering if somebody would know if there is any way with Ubuntu to EASILY assign a key on my keyboard to simulate a left click on my mouse? I have arthritis and I'm dying everytime I click on my mouse... I would appreciate it a lot if someone could kindly help me. Thank you
[05:51] <eduardo_> tem  br  ai ?
[05:51] <luis_> but    #!/bin/bash   sleep 30    conky       is a so kind of command to force the conky to start?
[05:52] <dr_willis> menu.lst is not used by grub2
[05:52] <dr_willis> luis_:  it bash scripting basics..  first line defines it being a script. #!/bin/bash     sleep does just that.. waits 30 sec.. then it runs conky.
[05:53] <dr_willis> luis_:  a simple 3 line file....  you then make it  executable via chmod +x whateveritsnameis.sh

[05:57] <ubottu> To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode

[06:02] <iBurley> Or is that something I have to just test out?
[06:02] <dr_willis> iBurley:  i cant recall ever seeing any benchmarks  where open sourced beat closed. but that was a year+ ago i last looked at them
[06:03] <dr_willis> Some of the Hardware blog sites may have benchmarks.
[06:03] <iBurley> Alright. I'm using this steam for Linux beta and I get real pathetic fps compared to my Windows partition, I think I'm gonna try the closed driver
[06:05] <ActionParsnip> JC_Yang: so, why do you need to see grub?
[06:05] <dr_willis> iBurley:  for games.. i belive you defainatly want the closed drivers.
[06:06] <iBurley> alright, good to know, and is there anything doing the switch can swrew up that can't be undone by switching back to open?
[06:06] <dr_willis> I always install nvidia-current first thing on my new installs.
[06:07] <dr_willis> the addaditional-drivers tool makes  it rather easy to change back and forth
[06:07] <iBurley> alright, cool. I'll have to try it out. Thanks for the help.

[06:27] <dr_willis> nullby7e:  i would guess the drivers are somehow confused and its not having 3d support/drivers so compiz/unity is failing to load competly
[06:27] <nullby7e> hmm you are right
[06:27] <raphzthename> so i'm going through the ubuntu install for my macbook pro and i'm hitting a wall
[06:28] <raphzthename> i'm installed rEFIT and am able to access it just fine when booting up
[06:28] <raphzthename> the problem is that rEFIT does not recognize the ubuntu liveCD, so there's no way to install 12.04
[06:30] <mesquka> hold option down while booting your mac

[06:36] <JC_Yang> http://blog.mattrudge.net/2012/10/02/changing-the-tty-resolution-on-ubuntu-server/
[06:36] <dr_willis> upgrades can fail. WHen in doubt make backups
[06:36] <JC_Yang> the author of this post claim correct configuration of console resolution, but what does the code 915 mean? do I have to set another value if I need other resolution?

[06:40] <Sailingmaster> I've got a macbook pro, and I'm considering setting up a Ubuntu partition on my machine.  I've got a problem though.
[06:40] <Mcgiwer> hello all
[06:40] <dr_willis> seems its macbook day  today.
[06:41] <raphzthename> ah, it shouldn't be this hard... i'm able to boot ubuntu from a usb stick now. it gets to the usb -> little stick figure man symbol then goes to a black screen with a blinking underscore
[06:41] <Sailingmaster> I'm trying to install from a USB stick, as I've replaced my optical drive with a SSD.  And when I select the option to try without installing, all I get is a black screen.  And the machine goes completely unresponsive
[06:41] <raphzthename> doesn't do anything but stay on that screen :(
[06:41] <Sailingmaster> yep, me too
[06:41] <Sailingmaster> I've read about setting nomodeset, but I don't have options to do that in the boot screen
=== no_name is now known as hyp
[06:42] <raphzthename> is your rEFIT able to recognize a liveCD?
[06:42] <raphzthename> i tried that a few times but no go
[06:42] <Sailingmaster> No optical drive.  USB stick is my only option.  I really don't want to have to go buy an external drive if I don't have to.
[06:43] <blim> hi, how do i stop the the black screen saver in 12.04?
[06:43] <Mcgiwer> I require urgent support
[06:43] <raphzthename> USB should work as it's a viable option. just have to figure out why it's not working
[06:43] <Sailingmaster> Agreed.  But it's not working for me...  So here I am.
[06:43] <Sailingmaster> :)
[06:43] <raphzthename> ditto :/
[06:44] <Sailingmaster> Anyone have an idea we can try?
[06:44] <teolicy> Hi. I'm trying to boot a quetzal server x64 USB stick. After getting the boot menu, choosing "Install Ubuntu Server" makes the machine reboot. Perhaps I didn't think of good search terms, but I was unable to find a good online resource on the matter. I've tried all the F6 options. Further instructions?
[06:44] <dr_willis> blim:  tryed the nomodset option yet?
[06:44] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[06:44] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[06:45] <blim> no, how I do that?
[06:45] <teolicy> (Looks like my condition is similar to Sailingmaster's…)
[06:45] <Mcgiwer> I have an serious problem with my Ubuntu 12
[06:47] <blim> in  terminal = bash: !nomodeset: event not found
[06:47] <dr_willis> its not a bash command.. read the url  the bot gave...
[06:47] <Sailingmaster> I would love to try nomodeset, but my boot screen does not list any function key abilities, nor does it respond to any function keys...  Is Quetzal's boot screen supposed to show these?
[06:48] <JC_Yang> follow the post, it work now. I've change the console resolution. Thank you
[06:48] <dr_willis> e = edit
[06:48] <nextblove> #cisco
[06:48] <dr_willis> Unless you got  a system that dosent like usb keyaord in grub.. and wants a ps2 keyboard
[06:48] <teolicy> dr_willis: After having tried the F6 options (and removing 'quiet' and 'splash' manually) without luck booting, any further ideas?
[06:48] <dr_willis> you tryed 'nomodeset verbose'  instead of quiet splash?
[06:49] <nullby7e> dr_willis: why system not recogniez custom builded headers i mean make-kpkg --initrd kernel_image kernel_headers or ubuntu uses and some other parameters?
[06:50] <dr_willis> nullby7e:  no idea really. I havent had to mess with the kernel in ages.
[06:50] <nullby7e> ok
[06:51] <teolicy> dr_willis: No, didn't add verbose. I'll try that. Thanks!

[07:15] <Mcgiwer> and no, I can't do any kind of raid when I have data on this disk... doing raid may damage them
[07:15] <invariant> Is it the best thing since sliced bread or do you think it isn't all that great?

[07:17] <ubottu> For information concerning ZFS and Ubuntu, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ZFS
[07:17] <invariant> dr_willis, I had seen that already. That's just marketing talk without the stories of actual users.
[07:18] <Naughx> @Mcgiwer... You could try to backup your full partition with dd >.<
[07:19] <Naughx> And mess with it after...
[07:19] <dr_willis> invariant:  thats the extent of what ive seen mentioned about zfs here.
[07:19] <Mcgiwer> @Naughx: what would that give? I will remain in the same point as I'm now
[07:19] <invariant> I recently saw a video on Windows 8 storage spaces and that seems to be exactly what I need.

[07:24] <invariant> That attitude won't bring in users, though. Especially not corporations.

[07:29] <faryshta> How can I configure fglrx driver to low power management?
[07:29] <invariant> donkeyrhubarb, capitalism has its good sides. The problems start when capitalism has selected a winner and thus all competition has no chance anymore.
[07:29] <donkeyrhubarb> doesn't vlc have support for that.. you mention playing video

[07:32] <Shirakawasuna> Hey, since the topic is raid I'll re-ask (normally wouldn't ask this quickly): I want to do RAID1 + LVM, but am getting conflicting information on whether I need to separate /boot out into its own partition that's not in the lvm group. Any thoughts / information?
[07:32] <invariant> The above is  why Storage Spaces are a good idea.
[07:32] <Shirakawasuna> ideally I want to just sync to my back up drive, verify its integrity, then wipe 4 identical disks, RAID1 on two so there's 2 sync'd disks, then LVM over the whole thing.
[07:32] <invariant> Nobody wants to care about all these details.
[07:33] <Shirakawasuna> then rsync everything from the backup to the single LVM volume
[07:33] <invariant> Let some storage programmer care about it once and then let the rest use it.
[07:33] <donkeyrhubarb> faryshta: if you're just watching movies when you go to sleep or something, most players have options to go to sleep after the video is done
[07:33] <faryshta> donkeyrhubarb, wut?
[07:34] <donkeyrhubarb> are you only playing video and trying to make the system power down afterward?
[07:34] <faryshta> donkeyrhubarb, fglrx is a graphic card driver, my question is not related to video players
[07:35] <invariant> faryshta, I don't think you can.
[07:35] <invariant> faryshta, it happens automatically.
[07:35] <invariant> faryshta, a large part of the driver is involved in powermanagement.
[07:38] <Kondor> How does one style directory listings via css &  javascript in apache
[07:38] <donkeyrhubarb> i know what it is.. i also know that aside from triggerring powerdown events from media players or screen savers, there isn't much else to configure for dimming screens or killing power to a display. forgive me if i made the assumption that your question was related to media streams

=== arij is now known as Guest57774
[07:56] <Ikillcypjer> It goes to grub resuce straight
[07:56] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: also ask in ##windows if there are other tools to restore the windows-bootloader
[07:56] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: please stop it here because windows is offtopic here
[07:56] <elfer> pm me ikillcypjer
[07:56] <donkeyrhubarb> which you can get around using usb sticks.. please google more
[07:56] <elfer> lets chat secretly
[07:56] <Ikillcypjer> It is not wndows issue it is an grub issue
[07:56] <elfer> aha
[07:56] <Ikillcypjer> Why dont you understand
[07:56] <Ikillcypjer> I boot my laptop it glo
[07:56] <Ikillcypjer> Goes to grub
[07:57] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: its a windows-issue because you want to restore the windows-bootloader which can only be done with windows
[07:57] <elfer> didn't someone mention grub rescue earlier?
[07:57] <Ikillcypjer> No
[07:57] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: restore the windows-bootloader, it will overwrite grub
[07:57] <elfer> yeah
[07:57] <Kondor> Sounds like your master boot record is --fucked--
[07:57] <elfer> windows installations tend to pwn drives
[07:57] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: and now stop it here please and ask in ##windows
[07:57] <Ikillcypjer> I want to make grub rescue boot up windows

[07:57] <ubottu> Kondor: please see above
[07:57] <somsip> Ikillcypjer: istructions were ion the link I gave you before.
[07:57] <cfhowlett> Ikillcypjer: grub RESCUE boot windows?
[07:57] <elfer> was ubottu talking to me?
[07:57] <Ikillcypjer> Yes
[07:58] <Kondor> No
[07:58] <elfer> o.0
[07:58] <roguewriter> Simple question. How do you access the boot options in grub 2.00?
[07:58] <Ikillcypjer> That cause i dont have a cd or usb
[07:58] <elfer> k
[07:58] <Fieldy> what would be a good / proper place to put commands I'd like done just after networking setup? particularly my own firewall commands, so it would need to be after the existing firewall rules being applied (or better yet replacing them)
[07:58] <Ikillcypjer> Or anything now to repair all i want to do is boot up windows via grubresuce
[07:58] <Ikillcypjer> Cause my ubuntu is gone
[07:58] <elfer> how many partitions do you have?
[07:59] <elfer> just windows now?
[07:59] <elfer> and winbackup?
[07:59] <cfhowlett> Ikillcypjer: then you don't need grub.  Use the windows restore boot tools and be done
[07:59] <Ikillcypjer> 2 yes dev/sha1
[07:59] <Ikillcypjer> Is windows
[07:59] <beliveyourdream> hey all .. i've installed some packaged with dpkg --install and one of them didn't get it's exec file to PATH .. should i add it to /etc/environment or there is a more elegant solution ?
[07:59] <elfer> sha1?
[07:59] <beliveyourdream> *packages
[07:59] <donkeyrhubarb> lol
[07:59] <raphzthename> so i'm still trying to get this installation to work... i was able to get into the ubuntu boot menu by pressing f6 when the man and the keyboard show up
[07:59] <Ikillcypjer> Other is clean harddisk
[07:59] <elfer> 0o
[07:59] <raphzthename> selected the "try it without installing option"
[07:59] <goddard> its not worth doing a raid if I have 2 drives that are exactly the same?
[08:00] <raphzthename> and this results in the black screen with the blinking underscore again
[08:00] <Ikillcypjer> Im.using my smart phone it is hard to type

=== TheRainbowDusk is now known as TheRainbowDawn
[08:00] <raphzthename> i've been staring at this screen for a while and it doesn't seem like it's doing anything
[08:00] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: "awhile"?  means how long?
[08:00] <elfer> i dont fux with grub and windows, strict linux lately
[08:00] <Ikillcypjer> How do I boot up Windows 7 from grub rescue
[08:00] <elfer> i should probably play with it tho
[08:01] <raphzthename> it's been about 5 minutes now. should it take much longer than that to "try it now" from a usb?
[08:01] <Kondor> Ikillcypjer: In you google search enter intitle:"index of windows" filetype:iso
[08:01] <Ikillcypjer> :( my mum is going to kill me
[08:01] <raphzthename> usb drive*
[08:01] <Muphrid> raphzthename: if you press ctrl+alt+f1 maybe you will have a log of whats happening
[08:01] <donkeyrhubarb> not worth it.. google can asnwer his question anyway
[08:01] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: nope.  too long.
[08:01] <Ikillcypjer> I donr have a workong pc
[08:01] <roguewriter> Anyone? How do I get to the boot options from the grub 2.00 boot screen?
[08:01] <elfer> someone mentioned something about MBR?
[08:01] <raphzthename> ctrl + alt + f1 doesn't do anything
[08:01] <Ikillcypjer> I dont have a windows cd
[08:01] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: is this a USB?  and did you verify the ISO via md5sum?
[08:01] <iceroot> roguewriter: just press "e" on a line you want to boot
[08:01] <elfer> well
[08:01] <raphzthename> yes, it's a usb drive
[08:01] <Ikillcypjer> Or anything to repair boot record
[08:02] <raphzthename> let me double check the ISO
[08:02] <Ikillcypjer> All i have is a grub resuce
[08:02] <Ikillcypjer> Why dont you under stand
[08:02] <elfer> can you boot a live linux cd? then maybe copy the windows backup, restore onto a disc?
[08:02] <elfer> rofl
[08:02] <cfhowlett> Ikillcypjer: assuming you have a legal copy of windows, download the iso from digitalriver.com, make usb and boot windows. then fix.
[08:02] <Ikillcypjer> Cant i dont have it
[08:02] <elfer> <Ikillcypjer> Why dont you under stand
[08:02] <donkeyrhubarb> lmao
[08:02] <elfer> lol brb
[08:02] <roguewriter> What happened to the function keys?
[08:02] <raphzthename> where do you find the md5 info?
[08:02] <beliveyourdream> anyone ??
[08:02] <cfhowlett> !md5sum
[08:02] <ubottu> To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[08:03] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: could you pleaee stop your windows-stuff here? you have to restore the mbr with /fixmbr using windows tools, so stop flooding this channel please and go to ##windows because you need windows-tools to fix your issue
[08:03] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: md5sum info is on the download page.
[08:03] <Ikillcypjer> Dude
[08:03] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: you need to overwrite grub with the windowes-mbr
[08:03] <Ikillcypjer> Listen
[08:03] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: stop it now
[08:03] <Ikillcypjer> I press my powerbutton
[08:03] <Ikillcypjer> And it goes straight to grubresuce

[08:07] <Ikillcypjer> Can you guys help me
[08:07] <cfhowlett> Ikillcypjer: nope.  we can't.  go to windows.
[08:07] <donkeyrhubarb> they did

[08:08] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: i understand your issue
[08:08] <elfer> yes we do
[08:08] <bazhang> Ikillcypjer, thats enough
[08:08] <cfhowlett> xiaoy: end of life.  consider upgrading.
[08:08] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: and because i know how to fix it i was telling it to you 10 times
[08:08] <bkerensa> Ikillcypjer: please I have asked you already in PM. Last warning
[08:08] <elfer> you have windows and it wont boot, and an ubuntu grub screen on bootup? lol
[08:08] <donkeyrhubarb> no but you can get on here which means you can google windows 7 free boot recovery or.. like this channel has mentioned, go to #windows
[08:08] <elfer> me too, PM ME Foo
[08:08] <elfer> or else
[08:09] <iceroot> and i dont get why the ops are not using the kick-trigger....
[08:09] <bazhang> elfer, lets move on
[08:09] <xiaoy> iceroot, yep i knew that, but this machine is too old to run updated version (even newer with low res DE)
[08:09] <iceroot> xiaoy: what is your hardware?
[08:09] <raphzthename> okay, i'm redownloading the iso and i'll run the md5 checksum afterwards
[08:09] <iceroot> xiaoy: lubuntu should always be fine in my opinion
[08:09] <Ikillcypjer> Ok i will ask in Windows
[08:09] <elfer> so how about them new linux kernel rootkits
[08:09] <cfhowlett> Xiaoqian: xubuntu?  lubuntu?  bot designed for old, low spec macines
[08:09] <xiaoy> celeron m, 500mb ram
[08:09] <Ikillcypjer> Jeez
[08:09] <elfer> 0o
[08:09] <iceroot> Ikillcypjer: thank you
[08:09] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: good luck.
[08:09] <raphzthename> dumb question: on ubuntuhash, there are image names for ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-amd64+mac.iso
[08:09] <hilarious> i have a perl script that connects to an outside server a couple of times per minute and under xp it would fail to connect about 10% of the time. now that i have it running under ubuntu it fails like 1/3 of the time
[08:10] <iceroot> xiaoy: i am using lubuntu on a 630mhz celeron, 512mb 4gb hdd (eeepc 701) fine
[08:10] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: and the question?
[08:10] <raphzthename> i'm downloading on osx right now and the download is ubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso
[08:10] <xiaoy> iceroot, ok thanks
[08:10] <raphzthename> should i be looking for the +mac version somewhere?
[08:10] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: let me look
[08:10] <iceroot> raphzthename: the names (i386, amd64, armel, mac) are for specific architectures
[08:10] <elfer> *looks away*
[08:10] <donkeyrhubarb> oh good grief
[08:11] <iceroot> raphzthename: newer mac systems are using amd64 as there architecture, older macs aure using ppc
[08:11] <iceroot> raphzthename: so on a newer mac amd64-mac should be fine
[08:11] <raphzthename> yes, but when i'm download the file, it is missing the +mac suffix
[08:11] <raphzthename> i was wondering if these are two different images
[08:11] <iceroot> xiaoy: i would suggest to give it a try, its not good to use 9.04 anymore because you dont get bug fixes and also no secuerity fixes
[08:11] <raphzthename> and perhaps i'm grabbing the wrong one
[08:12] <iceroot> raphzthename: i dont know why there is a special amd64-mac image but maybe ubottu has some infos
[08:12] <iceroot> !mac | raphzthename
[08:12] <ubottu> raphzthename: For help on installing and using Ubuntu on a mac, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages
[08:12] <roguewriter> Okay, so there are no boot options for grub 2.00...  and here I thought that ubuntu was getting more user friendly...  :-(
[08:12] <xiaoy> iceroot, already tryied: hangs using multiple tabs in FF
[08:12] <bazhang> !bootoptions > roguewriter
[08:12] <ubottu> roguewriter, please see my private message
[08:12] <cfhowlett> xiaoy: agree with iceroot.  I'd be surprised if xubuntu/lubuntu did not run on your machine
[08:13] <xiaoy> iceroot, it's not just the DE that makes things running faster
[08:13] <xiaoy> cfhowlett, they run, and all seems fine untill you do heavy work
[08:13] <iceroot> xiaoy: also a lighter browser like chromium which is the default on lubuntu
[08:13] <xiaoy> iceroot, well i can give it a try
[08:14] <xiaoy> for chromium, no wey to get latest version on 9.04
[08:14] <roguewriter> Sorry, using emacs to edit boot setups when all I want is the nomodeset command just seems petty.
[08:15] <invariant> What are the correct permissions of .gvfs?
[08:15] <raphzthename> yes, i've gone through the documentation. i have a macbook 5.3 (mid 2009) and am using this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleIntelInstallation
[08:15] <linocisco> is there any AutoCAD like application?
[08:15] <invariant> linocisco, qcad
[08:15] <raphzthename> per the instructions, i have installed rEFIT and it is successfully recognized upon boot
[08:16] <Muphrid> linocisco: librecad for 2d
[08:16] <linocisco> is there any AutoCAD like application more powerful than FreeCAD?
[08:16] <bazhang> linocisco, apt-cache search package
[08:16] <invariant> linocisco, there are also commercial ones.
[08:16] <linocisco> no. I need free one
[08:16] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: great job.
[08:16] <Muphrid> linocisco: gcad3d has high reputation afaik
[08:16] <Muphrid> for 3d
[08:17] <cfhowlett> linocisco: see http://www.osalt.com/autocad
[08:17] <Hanmac_> cfhowlett thanks for pointing me to that program
[08:18] <cfhowlett> Hanmac_: hope it does everything you need...
[08:18] <invariant> The problem with all of these suggestions is that linocisco probably just wants to hear the best solution like some other program on Windows is (I don't think AutoCad is the best).
[08:18] <linocisco> thanks
[08:18] <cfhowlett> linocisco: good luck
[08:18] <invariant> At the same time probably not a lot of people are experts at these programs.
[08:18] <Muphrid> linocisco: check brl-cad too
[08:19] <linocisco> is it better than FreeCAD?
[08:19] <invariant> linocisco, I am afraid there is no substitute for your own judgement.
[08:20] <bazhang> linocisco, dont poll here. try them out and decide for yourself
[08:20] <linocisco> invariant, thanks anyway bro.
[08:20] <linocisco> how about GIS software. I found only QGIS
[08:20] <roguewriter> I think that raphz and I are having similar problems. I'm on a mac as well. We have no options for nomodeset in grub.
[08:20] <cfhowlett> linocisco: search for "open source CAD" yields multiple hits ...
[08:20] <invariant> linocisco, you could also write an article on the wiki if you figured out which one is best.
[08:20] <invariant> I think such questions should have easy to Google answers.
[08:20] <linocisco> invariant, generic solution
[08:21] <cfhowlett> linocisco: also "open source gis"  http://www.opensource.gis.org
[08:21] <Ikillcypjer> How nice if you guys really
[08:21] <linocisco> invariant, I have been redirected to virus sites or doggone sites and lost
[08:21] <cfhowlett> www.opensourcegis.org
=== croppa is now known as croppa_
[08:21] <linocisco> cfhowlett, thanks
[08:21] <invariant> cfhowlett, yes, but just because something is found, doesn't mean it works.
=== croppa_ is now known as croppa
[08:21] <cfhowlett> linocisco: try before you buy
[08:21] <invariant> cfhowlett, for example, GNU released a format reader for dwg files.
[08:21] <cfhowlett> invariant: true.  suggested were requested and offered
[08:22] <DaemonicApathy> At least virus sites are normally reduced to amusing wastes of time on Ubuntu...
[08:22] <Hanmac_> cfhowlett i currently testing it ... i thoguht it works ... its only funny that you make an image of a VM while you are inside the VM :D
[08:22] <invariant> cfhowlett, except, it crashed on my inputs.
[08:22] <cfhowlett> Hanmac_: "we must go deeper" ...
[08:22] <invariant> DaemonicApathy, this is not true anymore.
[08:22] <Hanmac_> "images all the way down" :D
[08:23] <DaemonicApathy> invariant, would you mind a brief PM?
[08:23] <invariant> DaemonicApathy, no
[08:26] <faryshta> How can I configure fglrx driver to low power management?
[08:26] <roguewriter> Okay, silly question number 2, anyone know where I can get an ubuntu 10 image for mac so all the guides and screenshots actually correspond correctly?
[08:27] <cfhowlett> roguewriter:10.04 is still available and live
[08:27] <invariant> faryshta, asking the question twice doesn't change the answer.
[08:27] <bazhang> roguewriter, 10.04 is the only one still supported
[08:27] <bazhang> invariant, lose the attitude
[08:27] <iobug> hi all
[08:27] <raphzthename> okay, the md5 sum checks out
[08:27] <cfhowlett> iobug: greetings
[08:27] <roguewriter> Then why am I trying to install quetzal
[08:28] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: so one possible fault eliminated
[08:28] <raphzthename> now i'm going to recreate the bootable usb using this guide:
[08:28] <raphzthename> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx
[08:28] <faryshta> invariant, maybe another person have a different answer
[08:28] <invariant> faryshta, that would then be the wrong answer.
[08:29] <roguewriter> Raphz, that's what I'm using.  I keep getting a black screen, and I have no boot options.
[08:29] <invariant> *plonk*
[08:29] <iobug> any idea how to run command on startup? rc.local not use tty and the program not run (sorry for my bad english)
[08:29] <iobug> in the inittab also not running
[08:31] <Kartagis> any idea how I can integrate Dropbox context menu with dolphin?

[08:32] <iobug> somsip: sox, to record

[08:32] <roguewriter> I dont know what to try. The guides dont match up with what i have on my screen.
[08:32] <somsip> iobug: what command did you use in rc.local?
[08:33] <iobug> sox again
[08:33] <donkeyrhubarb> roguewriter: they won't, there's around 2 years difference in the installer screens vs the guides
[08:33] <somsip> iobug: is this a server or just a standalone program? Why do you need it running at boot?
[08:34] <iobug> I want to record all sound when the system is started up
[08:34] <iobug> and record the voice of all pressentations
[08:34] <somsip> iobug: it looks like something that needs userspace to me, so you'd need to start it as a user, but I don't really know and have never heard of it before
[08:35] <MangoBoy> Hi vlc have lost its window frames.. all other windows have them ? Does anyone have an idea?
[08:35] <somsip> MangoBoy: do you mean it's gone ful screen?
[08:35] <iobug> my be will run a sound server + client, but I want just to record file, not streaming...
[08:36] <somsip> iobug: does it run okay as a user?
[08:36] <roguewriter> Thanks to those of you who tried to help.  I hoped that someone here would know how to get ubuntu to work on a mac.  I guess it cant.
[08:36] <iobug> hmm with su <user> -c ?

[08:37] <somsip> iobug: looks like it doesn't work that way. You may need to research more to see if it can do what you want
[08:38] <somsip> MangoBoy: being stupid is healthy. Not recognising it is the dangerous thing
[08:38] <mattronix> has anyone played with the raspberry pi
[08:38] <mattronix> i got mine yesterday and i am in love with it :P

[08:39] <bazhang> mattronix, you can see in #ubuntu-arm
[08:39] <raphzthename> converting the .iso to .dmg seemed to go okay. would someone mind looking over the terminal output just to be sure everything is in order? http://imgur.com/a/ihwke
[08:40] <MangoBoy> somsip, yes but it's to muche sometimes.. Its like i have mold in my brain.. maybe i should not have linux :)
[08:42] <somsip> MangoBoy: allow yourself to learn. It takes time. It's okay. We're OT.

[08:46] <kp> ok
[08:46] <raphzthename> pros and cons of keeping osx for dual-boot versus just single booting ubuntu?
[08:46] <impi> compiz freaking out after last update...?
[08:46] <kp> i need help in citadel and ldap connectivity i have it connected but when i login through different users it displays same names
[08:47] <raphzthename> i won't be using osx for any reason, but for compatibility's sake is it better to dual-boot?
[08:47] <impi> compiz 30% cpu.
[08:47] <impi> ubuntu, why oh why oh why....
[08:47] <sexxxy> hey peeps

[08:48] <cfhowlett> raphzthename: if you truly won't use OSX, just delete it and have an ubuntu only machine ...
[08:49] <raphzthename> sounds good to me
[08:49] <DaemonicApathy> raphzthename: Might want to save a system image in case, though, since you seem to have at least one doubt.

[09:00] <skp1> jirido
[09:00] <skp1> :all your programs will still be installed
[09:00] <vlt> Hello. Is there a tool that tells me which process is causing heavy block I/O load?

[09:01] <cfhowlett> Muphrid: certainly HOPE so ...
[09:01] <kp> ok if no one knows abt citadel if we talk abt simple mail server connectivity with ldap then what can be the iissue
[09:02] <derjan> Hey
[09:02] <jirido> yes but im on lubuntu and the guys in #lubuntu thought it best to fresh install.. and as i have some small issues i thought it could be good!
[09:02] <cfhowlett> derjan: greetings
[09:02] <derjan> tnx
[09:04] <jirido> skp1, i have messed a little from before and thought it will take shorter time to reinstall then starting sorting out this small things anyway
[09:05] <skp1> i dunno of a way to keep a persistant list of your installed programs other than writing them down.
[09:05] <skp1> alot of people in here recommend fresh installs but i've never had a problem with upgrading.
[09:05] <Muphrid> skp1: I dont know of a better way, but most programs are in /usr/bin and they have the same name as the package
[09:06] <Muphrid> I'd just make an automatic list of them
[09:06] <elfer> occupy them
[09:06] <raphzthename> hmm, after choosing this boot option: http://i.imgur.com/Evm60.jpg it attempts to boot and then i get these errors: http://i.imgur.com/ZrVQM.jpg

[09:09] <jirido> Muphrid, can one somehow get a list just from them one have installed by choice and not all the dependences
[09:09] <elfer> okay then bye
[09:10] <Muphrid> jirido: /usr/bin does not contain dependencies, only executable binaries. it does, however, contain binaries which have a different name from the package
[09:10] <jirido> yes so it cant be used to feed apt

[09:11] <jirido> Sucha list i mean / skp1 ok

[09:12] <Muphrid> skp1: never heard of that, looks good indeed :)
[09:12] <skp1> just googled it.
[09:12] <fantus> hello, i just installed ubuntu 12.04 lts on my laptop, placed 20gb for root, 8for swap and 80for home...now my question is, when i want to reinstsall ubuntu which is atm in sda1, will my data(/home) in sda6 be safe?
[09:13] <skp1> fantus: as long as you dont erase it during the install.
[09:13] <rkhshm> i modified a C program to dump core and as expected i see a SEGV (core dump) but i cannot find the core file in the CWD
[09:13] <rkhshm> why is that"?
[09:13] <ServerSage> fantus: But, you should always back stuff up before reinstalling.  :)
[09:14]  * Mcgiwer is back (gone 01:54:26)
[09:14] <cfhowlett> fantus: most likely yes ... but backup anyway
[09:14] <jirido> skp1, Muphrid Good. nice!
[09:14] <fantus> ok thanks, another question...when i click "home" folder on desktop(gui), i see only FIle System partition...and because i created that "/home" i thought it will be showed up like in windows like (c,d,e) but instead they are both in very same partition. is that normal?
[09:15] <ServerSage> rkhshm: Sounds like a total non-ubuntu question, but you may find your answer here:  http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt
[09:15] <fantus> i mean, inside file system there is my home folder, with those 80gb size. thats normal or?
[09:15] <cfhowlett> fantus: normal
[09:15] <ServerSage> rkhshm: I'll save you the long read, take a look in /var/cache/abrt or /var/crash
[09:15] <cfhowlett> fantus: home does NOT contain the system folders e.g. C: in windows
=== jackson_ is now known as Noskcaj
[09:16] <fantus> cfhowlett : confused me, since i see only File System partition(e.g. C in windows ), but inside it i got that "home" folder with 80gb size.
[09:16] <Noskcaj> why when you install two DE's do some programs appear twice, e.g. lubuntu and xubuntu give two copies of task manager
[09:16] <fantus> why it didnt created a new one, like a new partition?
[09:17] <jirido> I also have an other Q. I have got pain in my hand from using the mouse and would like to use a joystick i found instead.. Is there some program or driver or way to get that ?
[09:17] <Hanmac_> fantus under linux the dirs could be on totaly different places ... like on my pc /boot is on a software raid1, then i have an lvm on a software raid5+ and on the lvm there are three logical partions for / and /home and swap
[09:17] <cfhowlett> fantus: why would it need a new partition?  /home contains all /user files... not just YOUR /home
[09:18] <cfhowlett> jirido: dont' now of such, but I like the giant trackball option ...
[09:19] <raphzthename> installation finished, but after choosing this boot option on startup: http://i.imgur.com/Evm60.jpg, it attempts to boot and then i get these errors: http://i.imgur.com/ZrVQM.jpg
[09:19] <raphzthename> any idea how i might get past this?
[09:19] <fantus> so im basically free to put folders like, movies, music inside that home folder, and during re-installation they will be safe,  as long as i pick sda1 (root one) to be reinstalled, and leave this one alone(sda6) ?\
[09:19] <fantus> it wasnt like this in 9.04
[09:19] <jirido> cfhowlett, I think it would be nice.. Al my arm gets tired from holding the fingers up al of the time
[09:19] <fantus> thats what confused me
[09:19] <fantus> :P
[09:19] <cfhowlett> fantus: correct.  also, do not format the /home
[09:20] <cfhowlett> fantus: things do change.
[09:20] <Muphrid> raphzthename: have you tried this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1434132
[09:20] <cfhowlett> jirido: giant trackball?  yes.  seems to be a ready remedy for some carpal tunnel issues.
[09:20] <Hanmac_> fantus: when you reinstall your ubuntu/linux look for the right install option (maybe Upgrade or expert)
[09:20] <fantus> yy ok
[09:21] <fantus> Thanks.
[09:21] <faryshta> How can I configure fglrx driver to low power management?
[09:21] <cfhowlett> fantus: hanmac is correct.  AUTO installing ubuntu will wipe your special options.
[09:21] <raphzthename> @muphrid will try that now, thanks
[09:21] <fantus> aha so i do it manually
[09:22] <fantus> noted.
[09:22] <ServerSage> fantus: And, of course, backup backup backup.  Can't be said enough.

[09:27] <Nirvash> Well, I hate IRC because it feels like everyone is just constantly dogging people. 3 people said "watch your mouth" up there when it didn't need to be said. I just want to DoS the channel that quieted me... HATE that people can still censor others.

[09:28] <raphzthename> thanks for all of the help y'all!
[09:28] <auronandace> Nirvash: perhaps you should start with stating your ubuntu issue
[09:28] <invariant> Nirvash, #ubuntu is just a corporate channel.
[09:28] <Nirvash> How were they vulgar? Explain it concisely and I'll listen to your argument.
[09:28] <invariant> Nirvash, it's not a democracy. It's more like fascism, like all corporations.
[09:28] <ServerSage> Nirvash: XXXX my life. How does one get "unquieted" in a channel?
[09:28] <Hanmac_> amanSharma install them and then build the driver again (without the header and dkms package the modules cant be put inside the linux-image)
[09:28] <Bhaki82> Nirvash: You sound like an idiot... DoS the channel? Hah
[09:29] <ServerSage> Nirvash: I'm not sure what your definition of vulgar is, but that is THE definition.
[09:29] <invariant> Bhaki82, DoSsing the channel would be easy for most people.

[09:45] <Muphrid> that means gnome is dropping it though
[09:45] <Robbilie> are you talking bout gnome shell in ubu?
[09:45] <Bhaki82> Hanmac_: If you like the classic Gnome, you might look at moving to XFCE in the long term
[09:45] <donkeyrhubarb> or lxde
[09:47] <Hanmac_> i tryed XFCE (was installed with my ubuntu studio, but there was some freaking bugs that i dont want, cant remember i think there was something ugly with the panels)

[09:54] <KrisWood> I'm trying to install wifi on my grandma's ubuntu 10.04 laptop. The only internet access I have is through my phone acting as a wifi hotspot. When I attempt to install the driver for the wifi card (Broadcom B43 wireless driver) via the Hardware Drivers wizard it attempts to download it from the repository. That of course is impossible. How may I download the driver on my other PC so I can copy it over to the ubuntu one via USB?

[09:58] <KrisWood> Hanmac_ I just found the deb here: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/b/b43-fwcutter/
[09:58] <KrisWood> at least that's the one it's trying to download on the laptop
[10:00] <Hanmac_> hm no the fwcutter is for different stuff ... you need the kernel/dkms package
[10:00] <Hanmac_> (as far as i understand)
[10:01] <KrisWood> now to hope the ubuntu laptop will see my phone as a usb disk drive hehe
[10:01] <KrisWood> I'm sure it'll ask for those, too. I'm just trying to give it the package it's asking for
[10:05] <Hanmac_> Kriswood there should be no problem ... i stick my handy last time on my laptop, activate the Tethering option and on ubuntu an new cable device appears (without installing extra packages)
[10:06] <KrisWood> Hanmac_: good idea, I'll try that, too
[10:07] <Hanmac_> i mean my mobilephone (in germany we have the english-looking word "handy" for that)
[10:10] <vitaliko> Hanmac_ any idea how to lower the sens below the gui thresh hold?
[10:10] <vitaliko> mouse sensitivity that is
[10:12] <Franna> Hi
[10:12] <Franna> :)
[10:12] <vitaliko> hello
[10:12] <Franna> Can someone help me with an installation error
[10:12] <Franna> :)
[10:13] <vitaliko> definitely not me, im new

[10:14] <Franna> ok I am trying to install Asterisk on a 64Bit server. It gives me the following error message "Failed to fetch http://za.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openais/libsaevt3_1.1.4-4_amd64.deb  Hash Sum mismatch"
[10:15] <KrisWood> Hanmac_: Your idea worked perfectly, it installed the driver with no problems! The device still appears inactive though, rebooting now.
[10:15] <Franna> I cleared the /var/lib/apt/lists
[10:15] <Franna> exec apt-get clean and apt-get update
[10:16] <Franna> also deleted the file out of the cache
[10:16] <Kartagis> any idea how I can integrate Dropbox context menu with dolphin?
[10:16] <riqdiiz> hi all where can I get gta cheat codes?
[10:17] <ClockworkAnt> Hi Ubuntu support. I've added my google accounts to "Online accounts" however it doesnt appear in thunderbird. Am I missing a connector app or something? Same issue with contacts
[10:17] <KrisWood> Hanmac_: ...and I now have wifi on the laptop! Maybe I can convince grandma not to put windows on it now that it works hehe :)
[10:18] <Hanmac_> maybe you could fool her that is this windows new look :D
[10:19] <KrisWood> She may be 92 years old, but she knows the difference between windows and ubuntu hehe
[10:19] <KrisWood> ok it's 2am here I'm off to bed. Have a good night and thanks for the help!!!
[10:19] <Hanmac_> an oldschool hacker right? :D

[10:21] <lansd> hii, im having a problem compiling a kernel in ubuntu 12.04
[10:21] <lansd> vmlinux.o Segmentation fault make[1]: *** [vmlinux.o] Error 139 make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/xx/src/linux-3.2.0' make: *** [debian/stamp/build/kernel] Error 2
[10:22] <lansd> anyone knows how can i fix it?
[10:23] <KrisWood> lansd: Is there more to the error?
[10:24] <Ben64> lansd: why are  you compiling a kernel?
[10:24] <lansd> KrisWood: noup
[10:24] <lansd> Ben64: i need more dvb adapters
[10:25] <Ben64> doesn't it let you have 10 already?
[10:25] <meet> want quick opinions.. ubuntu 12.04 vs 12.10?
[10:25] <meet> which should i opt for
[10:26] <Ben64> 12.04 is LTS, so you don't need to upgrade for 2-5 years
[10:26] <gac> do you want new stuff, or do you want to be able to run it for 3 years with "no changes"?
[10:26] <meet> gac i like the new stuff
[10:26] <gac> 12.10 then
[10:26] <KrisWood> ok good night for real, sleep well everyone!
[10:26] <gac> and then upgrade every 6 months for new things
[10:26] <domie> "no changes" meaning "stuff doesn't break ever"
[10:26] <meet> gac but does that mean i have to completely reinstall everything and lose everything old?
[10:26] <gac> sorted :)
[10:27] <gac> meet: no, you can upgrade without reinstalling
[10:27] <Ben64> meet: you can upgrade 12.10 -> 13.04 -> 13.10 -> 14.04
[10:27] <Ben64> but stuff may break in between
[10:27] <gac> domie: i wouldn't go that far, as things still do change (i.e. security fixes) which can cause breakage, but there's no "major" changes
[10:27] <cfhowlett> meet: it means you get to experience bleeding edge tech and heartache every 6 months ...
[10:27] <meet> Ben64 so i cannot update 12.04?
[10:27] <gac> meet: yeah, you can
[10:27] <Ben64> 12.04 goes straight to 14.04
[10:28] <gac> by default it will, but if you change a setting you can go from the LTS cycle to the normal cycle
[10:28] <cfhowlett> meet: 12.04 is LTS.  You can choose to install ONLY LTS which means update manager will ignore 12.10, 13.04, etc.  Next LTS release is 14.04.
[10:28] <meet> oh.. but i am using 12.04 now from 11.10 and lot of problem have come up
[10:28] <Ben64> like?
[10:29] <meet> earlier it was smooth and perfect and all devices worked perfectly.. but now my mouse and graphics are a little bit buggy
[10:29] <gac> cfhowlett: wrong, you can change at any time so that you can install a regular version
[10:29] <gac> meet: http://www.noobslab.com/2012/10/upgrade-ubuntu-1204-precise-to-ubuntu.html
[10:29] <meet> a click is not recognized often or pointer blinks etc
[10:29] <domie> gac, true, not really that far, but still, 12.10 is more unstable than 12.04, at least for me
[10:29] <Ben64> you're likely to have the same problems or more on 12.10
[10:30] <Ben64> LTS versions are considered to be more stable
[10:30] <meet> ben64 but if 11.10 was working perfectly fine why did this problems crop up?
[10:30] <cfhowlett> meet: consider your uses.  If you REALLY need latest/greatest shiny stuff, the go for 12.10.  If you would rather have a "stable" version with long term support, then LTS.

[10:30] <VictorCL> is that a 32bit or 64bit ubuntu vesion?
[10:30] <gac> 32bit
[10:31] <Ben64> meet: could be unity, could be graphics drivers, could be anything

[10:32] <meet> ok should i go for the wubi installation or dual boot
[10:32] <meet> i have win7 along with ubuntu now
[10:32] <meet> on wubi
[10:32] <Ben64> dual boot is better
[10:33] <domie> wubi is just awesomesauce in my opinion
[10:33] <cfhowlett> meet: wubi is intended for ubuntu testing, not long-term installation.
[10:33] <meet> ok. just need some tips..
[10:34] <meet> i have been using wubi based installation for nearly an year now.. i have a separate drive for that even if its not needed..
[10:35] <meet> i have setup my ubuntu perfectly as i want.. but still since has it been quite buggy.. i intend to do a complete new install of 12.10.. so what steps should i take to prevent any boot related problems
[10:36] <cfhowlett> meet: perform an md5sum check of your downloaded iso, have your windows install disk closeby in case you need to restore your mbr, backup everything important, don't drink and compute ...
[10:37] <usr13> meet: Just tell it to write grub to MBR, (master boot record of the hard drive).
[10:37] <meet> cfhowlett i put the iso on a usb using unetbootin and it worked well.. so is it good?
[10:37] <meet> usr13 did not get it?
[10:37] <cfhowlett> meet: is good
[10:37] <meet> during installation will it ask me?
[10:37] <usr13> meet: Get what?
[10:38] <usr13> meet: Yes
[10:38] <usr13> How big is your HD?
[10:38] <meet> but i want to have the windows boot loader
[10:38] <TomyLaptop> hi
[10:38] <usr13> meet: Good luck with that.
[10:38] <TomyLaptop> using pulseaudio, i'm trying to get sound on another user
[10:38] <meet> the grub one adds quite a lot of options i don't want those
[10:38] <usr13> meet: What options?
[10:39] <TomyLaptop> that works so far, but only while no sound is playing on my main user
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[10:39] <TomyLaptop> is that normal? are there any workarounds?
[10:39] <cfhowlett> meet: see, NOW things get interesting.  easybcd is a windows program that "should" allow you to do this but ... YMMV
[10:39] <domie> meet, if you are still doing a wubi installation, then just backup the current folder where you have it installed, uninstall it, and install the new one
[10:39] <meet> usr13 like all the previous linux kernel versions or something.. and then a win7 option
[10:39] <usr13> meet: Uninstall previous linux kernels and those options will go away.
[10:40] <meet> usr13 : how to do that? :-|
[10:40] <usr13> meet: But what do you care, you will normally only use one option anyway.
[10:40] <meet> i don't want any clutter
[10:40] <usr13> meet: So uninstall any kernels that you do not use, leave only one.
[10:41] <meet> cfhowlett: easybcd ... should i just load the mbr for win7?
[10:41] <cfhowlett> meet: errr, you MIGHT wish to keep one extra kernel.  New kernels have been known to break things
[10:42] <hangingclowns> is there a way to allow all localhost connections with ufw?
[10:42] <cfhowlett> meet: ubuntu's default bootloader is grub.  You said "no grub".  the only way to boot ubuntu with the windows bootloader is via easybcd ... or so I understand
[10:42] <wildc4rd> I keep getting an install fail on my netbook, ubuntu12.10 from a USB stick, it stops 2 thirds of the way from completion of system installation, any thoughts?
[10:42] <cfhowlett> wildc4rd: did you verify that you're booting a good iso?
[10:43] <Zeu5_> hi there
[10:43] <TomyLaptop> iso? on a usb stick?
[10:43] <usr13> meet: I recommend 10.04-LTS
[10:43] <cfhowlett> Zeu5_: greetings
[10:43] <cfhowlett> TomyLaptop: of course
[10:43] <meet> usr13: why?
[10:43] <Zeu5_> i was given instructions on how to set nopasswd for sudo service php5-fpm restart
[10:43] <Zeu5_> http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/59843/29473
[10:43] <meet> 10.04?
[10:43] <usr13> meet: And trust me,  allow the grub boot loader to be written to MBR.
[10:43] <cfhowlett> TomyLaptop: unetbootin uses the iso to make the bootstick
[10:43] <wildc4rd> cfhowlett, it does the same thing with 2 downloads of ubuntu as well as a debian install
[10:43] <usr13> !lts | meet
[10:43] <ubottu> meet: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[10:44] <TomyLaptop> oh, nm then
[10:44] <aFeijo> good morning
[10:44] <Zeu5_> i am not sure how to find the full path to the command service
[10:44] <Zeu5_> advice?
[10:44] <domie> has anyone tried wubi and normal install on the same machine and noticed any performance differences?
[10:44] <aFeijo> I have this error in my new ubuntu server which I installed dovecot with mysql: Unsuported dictionary type mysql. I already installed dovecot-mysql package, what else do I need?
[10:44] <usr13> domie: Performance is not the issue.
[10:44] <meet> domie: i tried. not much difference
[10:44] <cfhowlett> wildc4rd: OK, that suggests that you're trying to install something beyond your hardware capabilities
[10:45] <cfhowlett> aFeijo: greetings
[10:45] <usr13> domie: wubi is a pseudo system.
[10:45] <meet> usr13: why 10.04?
[10:45] <usr13> meet: 12.04  Sorry if I said 10.04, that was a typo.
[10:45] <wildc4rd> cfhowlett, it was running on there before though
[10:46] <meet> usr13: i currently have 12.04 using wubi
=== Albastos is now known as Albastos|off
[10:46] <cfhowlett> wildc4rd: what version of ubuntu are you trying to install?
[10:46] <meet> but it is  quite buggy.. makes m e switch over to win7 immediately within 10 min!!
[10:46] <wildc4rd> cfhowlett, I was doing a clean install of 12.10 as it had been upgraded through several versoins over the last 3 or 4 years
[10:46] <sherlockh> i am having a lot of trouble with ubunutu 12.10
[10:46] <cfhowlett> wildc4rd: on a netbook?
[10:47] <domie> usr13, i was just wondering if there are advantages to a normal install that would make me switch from my wubi install
[10:47] <wildc4rd> cfhowlett, yes
[10:47] <Zeu5_> sorry, so how do i find the full path to service? as in sudo service php5-fpm restart
[10:47] <usr13> domie: Yes
[10:47] <sherlockh> i get system error everytime i boot
[10:47] <sherlockh> apport crashes
[10:47] <TomyLobo> (pulseaudio) i'm trying to get sound on another user. that works so far, but only while no sound is playing on my main user. is that normal? are there any workarounds?
[10:47] <cfhowlett> wildc4rd: have you tried xubuntu or lubuntu?  Both are designed for low spec machines which I THINK is what a netbook is ...
[10:47] <sherlockh> last time xorg crashed too
[10:47] <sherlockh> and the machine has become slower
[10:48] <meet_> usr13: i currently have 12.04 using wubi...but it is  quite buggy.. makes m e switch over to win7 immediately within 10 min!!
[10:48] <sherlockh> i dont mind the crashes
[10:48] <usr13> meet_: I don't doubt it. wubi is just a pseudo system.
[10:48] <sherlockh> but the performance has dropped below 12.04
[10:48] <meet_> so will dual boot help?
[10:48] <wildc4rd> cfhowlett, I tried xubuntu last night, and DSL yesterday at some point. Thinking about it, it may be a hardware fault...
[10:48] <sherlockh> any suggestion
[10:49] <usr13> meet_: yes
[10:49] <cfhowlett> meet: consider: wubi creates an ubuntu "image" that is subject to all the breakages that plague windows.
[10:49] <troybi>  hi.i write a program in assembly which read a file turn back numbers of Words, Sentenses and Paragraph.i want to chang it to just tell the number of words...when i cut each part of it it make so many errors ...how delete the parts which tell how many sentence and paragraph exists?  http://pastebin.com/nwcNZb7x
[10:49] <TomyLobo> troybi try #asm
[10:49] <cfhowlett> wildc4rd: especially if things WERE working and now aren't ...
[10:49] <meet_> while uninsstalling wubi.. i just remove it from windows like any other program right? usr13
[10:49] <Zeu5_> cfhowlett: hi there, would you mind helping me out? i only have a quick question
[10:50] <cfhowlett> Zeu5_: ask in channel.  I'll help if I can ...
[10:50] <aFeijo> asm?? omg
[10:50] <Zeu5_> sorry, so how do i find the full path to service? as in sudo service php5-fpm restart
[10:50] <troybi> TomyLobo: no answer at ther :( can you helo me plz.in this room people are more friendly than there
[10:50] <usr13> Zeu5_: which service
[10:50] <TomyLobo> troybi it's off-topic here
[10:51] <meet_> usr13: one quick question. if i am ready to upgrade frequently, 12.04 or 12.10 ?
[10:51] <Zeu5_> sudo service php5-fpm restart
[10:51] <cfhowlett> meet: see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#Uninstallation
[10:51] <meet_> usr13: which is better?
[10:51] <Zeu5_> usr13: i mean sudo service php5-fpm restart
[10:51] <TomyLobo> troybi and i'll also consider this dichotomy: either they're inactive or they're unfriendly. which is the case?
[10:52] <Zeu5_> usr13: i need the full path as indicated in this answer http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/59843/29473
[10:52] <usr13> meet_: I've given my recomendation, take it or leave it.  (I personally  use xubuntu.  I find xfce to be a very nice Window Manager.)
[10:52] <ianm_> is it possible to get a wacom to *not* move the mouse cursor (but continue to send XInput) ?
[10:52] <usr13> meet_: LTS
[10:52] <meet_> ok
[10:52] <sherlockh> anyone know how to use my cpu at maximum performance
[10:52] <TomyLobo> actually that probably isnt a dichotomy, but they're mutually exclusive nonetheless
[10:52] <cfhowlett> meet_: LTS
[10:53] <meet_> thanks cfhowlett and usr13. have a good day
[10:53] <cfhowlett> meet_: have fun, be safe
[10:53] <TomyLobo> troybi a way to get more literate answers is to sound more literate yourself
[10:54] <troybi> TomyLobo: no no ...thats not about litrate...at there there is silence
[10:55] <TomyLobo> troybi no abbreviations invented since 1980, proper spacing (after punctuation, NOT before), proper spelling
[10:55] <usr13> Zeu5_: which  is a tool that helps you locate a command, (it gives full path to it).
[10:56] <sherlockh> anyone know how to use my cpu at maximum performance
[10:56] <Zeu5_> okay usr13 i go try now
[10:56] <cfhowlett> sherlockh: not really an ubuntu issue.  sorry
[10:57] <usr13> Zeu5_: For instance, if you give command:  which service  It will return  /usr/sbin/service (which is the full path for service).
[10:57] <cfhowlett> usr13: which *command* will give path
[10:57] <sherlockh> cfhowlett: which issue is it then?
[10:57] <VictorCL> sherlockh,  if you open some 20 tabs on firefox it will use 100% of cpu
[10:58] <VictorCL> ^^
[10:58] <cfhowlett> sherlockh: hardware.
[10:58] <sherlockh> VictorCL: i am talking about having nothing open and using sfce
[10:58] <sherlockh> *xfce
[10:58] <wildc4rd> cfhowlett, for the record, ubuntu runs perfectly from the USB stick still, just fails on the install
[10:58] <Zeu5_> usr13: i got /usr/bin/service as well. thank you. :) :)
[10:58] <sherlockh> i red somewhere that linux rationalises the cpu usage and doesnt use the maximum
[10:58] <sherlockh> is this true
[10:59] <cfhowlett> wildc4rd: you have a nice puzzle to figure out then.  I'd look at your hardware ...
[10:59] <sherlockh> i have decent enough laptop
[10:59] <sherlockh> itsw a dell inspiron 1420
[10:59] <sherlockh> *its
[10:59] <usr13> sherlockh: What you read probably tries to explain that a Linux system makes effecient use of hardware resources.

[11:16] <VictorCL> is there an easy tutorial to install oracle db server on ubuntu 11.04 ???
[11:17] <Ben64> VictorCL: 11.04 is no longer supported
[11:18] <usr13> VictorCL: 11.04 is EOL as of October 28, 2012
[11:18] <cfhowlett> VictorCL: see link.  Also, 11.04 is end of life.  Upgrading soon?  http://www.techienote.com/2011/09/oracle-database-11g-r2-on-ubuntu-11-04.html
[11:18] <VictorCL> so there is no way to install it?
[11:18] <abgeek> is there any software like connectify for ubuntu ?
[11:18] <cfhowlett> VictorCL: did you see the link?  http://www.techienote.com/2011/09/oracle-database-11g-r2-on-ubuntu-11-04.html

[11:19] <VictorCL> but then on step 5 I get: E: Unable to locate package oracle-xe-universal
[11:19] <abgeek>  is there any software like connectify for ubuntu
[11:19] <Ben64> probably because 11.04 is eol

[11:21] <abgeek>  is there any software like connectify for ubuntu
[11:21] <usr13> VictorCL: Upgrade to Ubuntu 11.10   Or re-install with 12.04-LTS
[11:22] <VictorCL> I dont want unity :/
[11:22] <Ben64> abgeek: stop repeating...

[11:36] <lucian> hello. i'm trying to start mongod through service and it fails to do so. it says "started" and gives me a pid, but it's a new one every time. stopping it fails with "unknown instance" and there is no process running. this happens with both the ubuntu and 10gen repos, on 12.10
[11:36] <lucian> also, this didn't use to happen with previous versions of ubuntu
[11:36] <lucian> is this likely to be a bug in upstart?

[11:42] <Starcraftmazter> \
[11:42] <cfhowlett> jjgalvez__: I would think not since dd can run an unattended dup ...
[11:43] <jjgalvez__> cfhowlett: that's what I was hopping, because I didn't want to leave the computer logged in all night long just because I have a daily backup scheduled
[11:45] <cfhowlett> jjgalvez__: I've never used DD, but I have read about it.  Good luck.
[11:46] <Ben64> jjgalvez__: you log out of ubuntu at night?
[11:46] <MonkeyDust> jjgalvez__  i have a daily backup with rsync in crontab, you don't need to be logged in to do it that way - i'm not familiar with deja dup
[11:47] <jjgalvez__> MonkeyDust: Thanks that was going to be my next question
[11:48] <MonkeyDust> jjgalvez__  if I want to backup (at 4am), I just keep my PC switched on
[11:48] <jjgalvez__> Ben64: I normally turn the computer off, but now that I am setting up daily backups I am going to leave it on, so I was just going to log off. Do you not see any advantage to doing that?
[11:49] <jjgalvez__> MonkeyDust: is that when daily Crontab jobs are run?
[11:49] <MonkeyDust> jjgalvez__  yes
[11:49] <jjgalvez__> MonkeyDust: cool good to know
[11:49] <Ben64> jjgalvez__: nope, no advantage to keeping it on but logged out

[12:14] <MonkeyDust> keshav  maybe you need usb-modeswitch
[12:15] <keshav> Trouble in detecting usb stick or modem which is iball 3.5g with ubuntu 12.10
[12:15] <vitaliko> test
[12:15] <keshav> + was never ever detected using a live environment with 32 gb pen drive
[12:15] <jjgalvez__> I just read https://live.gnome.org/DejaDup/HowItWorks#Scheduling and it looks like Deja Dup does not use Cron to schedule backups, so I guess I am going to have to stay logged in if I want to use it to run my backups.
[12:15] <MonkeyDust> keshav  in a terminal, type       sudo apt-get install usb-modeswitch
[12:16] <iceroot> jjgalvez__: yes
[12:16] <iceroot> jjgalvez__: but you can also start it from the shell and then use cron
[12:17] <jjgalvez__> iceroot: so turn off its daily backup setting and just set up a cron to do it?
[12:17] <keshav> MonkeyDust,  usb-modeswitch is already the newest version.

[12:22] <keshav> cause it wasnt detected
[12:23] <OerHeks> oh you didn't tried that solution... or did you not read that url at all?
[12:24] <keshav> i did

[13:00] <_alpha_> if I enable ufw on my ubuntu server (remotely via. ssh), will I immediately get kicked out, since presumably ssh is blocked until I open it?
[13:01] <r4y> If I  use a live usb flash of ubuntu and do sudo touch /forcefsck will Ubuntu check a ahrd drive that is connected?, and if not how can I get it to check storage?, I mean like a hard drive that is used like a flash drive, and when I say check I mean the short check because the long check is insanely long and didn't help me when I tried it.
[13:01] <Pici> _alpha_: typically there are no rules until you add them.
[13:01] <r4y> Instead when I want to fix bad sectors I use DBAN and spinrite then reinstall
[13:02] <_alpha_> so it doesn't block anything by default?
[13:02] <bono> _alpha_: do a "sudo ufw allow ssh" before "sudo ufw enable"
[13:02] <bono> _alpha_: afaik yes
[13:03] <_alpha_> that makes sense, ok
[13:03] <r4y> I mean the long test when using fsck is insane, sorry to interupt you guys. I want to leave here some. I would like an answer but I will understand if you guys are not sure or some how confuse me, lol

[13:05] <r4y> I think either my motherboard or bios on my other motherboard is partially currupted and I am going to use this computer to fix the bad sectors on 3 of my hard drives
[13:05] <Davst> guess I'll just have to try reinstalling ubuntu from start and hoping for the best. problem with everything being cinfigurable is that noone has any idea how to fix it

[13:07] <Davst> Hi, I'm having issues with getting audio from my Spdif -> HDMI device in 12.10 Sound was working, but after installing proprietary drivers, using flash-aid and rebooting all sound is gone using digital output, only analogue works, anyone know what might be the issue? Or do I have to reinstall ubuntu from scratch to get the audio back?
[13:07] <r4y> I completely gave up on my other computer until I get a message back from mach speed about if I should flash bios. I gave them a lot of info of my assumptions for which I am not too sure about but I tried about as hard as I could to narrow down the culprid
[13:07] <ivotkl> Davst: Then I'm lost there, sorry. Are you sure SPDIF is not damaged or needs an additional driver not installed yet?
[13:07] <Davst> ivotkl, worked fine before reboot
[13:07] <r4y> I told you I tried fsck and it didn't work out for me so I don't use fsck
[13:07] <iseer> ok im confused now, i just logged out after booting in with nomodeset and i am stuck at a pink screen can anybody help?
[13:08] <Davst> ivotkl, I'm sure if i install windows it'll be back working again
[13:08] <r4y> I now only use dban and spinrite

[13:16] <iseer> I am stuck at a pink screen after logging out, after i used nomodeset to boot, does anybody know what could be wrong and how to fix it?
[13:17] <Davst> ivotkl, yeah the only problem i had in windows before is that it worked.

[13:19] <tasslehoff> after a fresh, encrypted install of 12.10 boot doesn't get past "starting CUPS". it says that fsck on /boot has corrected errors on every boot. known issue?
[13:20] <tasslehoff> this is on a lenovo t530 with ssd, btw
[13:20] <bekks> tasslehoff: Use a live CD to run fsck -f on the filesystem that is mounted as /boot
[13:21] <tasslehoff> bekks: ok.
[13:21] <memand> Hey guys, I'm when I log in on my system it takes a really long time from me having pressed enter until the desktop actually loads (I just see the ubuntu background (not even my own)) so I'm thinking there must be some startup program that takes a loong time to load, is there anything I can do about that?
[13:21] <Davst> MonkeyDust, sorry, just sick of linux mysterious errors that can't be solved heh
[13:21] <kanha> angela_1: ubuntu 12.10
[13:23] <r4y> What a minute, does touch /forcefsck only check the file system?
[13:23] <r4y> I meant wait a minute
[13:23] <Left_Turn> is the unity launcher visible on the desktop screen?
[13:23] <worm> MonkeyDust: Read, and that did not help.
[13:24] <r4y> I really wasn't trying to be rude earlier, it's just todays been a pretty bad day for me
[13:24] <claudiu_> memand, you can uncheck what you don't use from startup aplications, and disable visual effects from appearance
[13:24] <memand> Left_Turn: If you are talking to me: No nothing, just the ubuntu background (it does not even load my personal background) I can't even launch a terminal
[13:25] <bekks> r4y: There is no automatic check of smartctl, etc. but only for fsck, which can be enforced by sudo touch /forcefsck
[13:25] <Left_Turn> oh sorry memand i was asking as im rather new
[13:25] <MonkeyDust> worm  wubi is a very limited test-installation
[13:25] <Left_Turn> asking the chan i mean
[13:25] <memand> Left_Turn: np :)
[13:25] <bekks> r4y: If you need further investigation, use smartctl to actually run SMART tests on your hardddrive(s).
[13:25] <worm> MonkeyDust: So do I need to re-install the whole Ubuntu to a new partition?
[13:26] <MonkeyDust> worm  yes, that's my advice
[13:27] <r4y> is smartctl for monitoring?
[13:27] <MonkeyDust> worm  partitioning is the hardest part in the process, the installation itself takes about 15-20 minutes
[13:27] <Sling> r4y: and for doing smart tests, etc
[13:27] <Ladillero> _=[ Hello ]=_
[13:27] <Sling> see its manpage
[13:27] <memand> claudiu_: I can try that, but there really is not a lot of stuff starting up
[13:27] <claudiu_> memand: you changed something recently?
[13:27] <r4y> so if this motherboard has smart I do that then?
[13:28] <worm> MonkeyDust: But I am not sure if that is compatible for a rookie. And is there anyway to create a back-up of the operating system?
[13:28] <Ladillero> _=[ I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 alongside Windows 8 and the grub does not work, Windows 8 runs as if it was the only OS ]=_

[13:29] <worm> MonkeyDust: I see and that is only the thing I can do if he still use wubi. However as you suggest us not to use wubi, that become a problem. Any way to back-up the system if it is installed into a hard drive?
[13:30] <worm> A partition, sorry
[13:30] <memand> claudiu_: It's a pretty fresh install, so I'm still changing things all the time :/ but off the top of my head I can't think of anything I have changed that should affect the startup time that much, we are talking like 20 secs of nothing

[13:33] <cache_za> i need to copy a directory (which has non default permissions) from one location to another and apply default directory/file permissions recursively on the destination directory, is this possible?
[13:33] <r4y> great, but does it need to be truned on in bios?, perhaps that depends on the motherboard and bios version
[13:33] <claudiu_> memand: install StartUp-Manager from software center and you can change the wait time
[13:35] <memand> claudiu_: Nice, I just found a possible problem in the start-up section. I have replaced the ubuntu screensaver with xscreensaver and it starts up the xscreensaver daemon at login, but xscreensaver has been kind of laggy lately, could that have anything to do with it?
[13:36] <r4y> So does sudo touch /forcefsck only check the filesytem, as in not what's stored in the home folder but just the filesystem?
[13:37] <r4y> Why is that take less time then the fsck commands I had tried?
[13:37] <Orpheon> I have a problem with an SD card and a SD-to-USB adapter: Nothing happens when I put it in, it appears in /dev as sdf and also appears in Disk Utility. Trying to format it or doing anything with it gives an error about the device not existing
[13:38] <Orpheon> sudo fdisk -l doesn't mention it at all

[14:10] <brendan_> Onii-san: bottom line is.. no gui is installed on the vps by default, you could install one if you desire. Its not recommended because its a waste of resources that take away from your system

[14:14] <Ladillero> Riley88 no, not yet... Should I ?
[14:14] <Riley88> pretty good atlef
[14:14] <Riley88> yea
[14:15] <Riley88> what headset is it atlef
[14:15] <devnull_> yea i couldn't tell you ... might need to mess with gconf
[14:15] <atlef> Riley88, logitech f540
[14:15] <tester> Ronalds_M, I was wrong, check out this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3fQuTfLZBo
[14:15] <Riley88> i have the giant ps3 bluetooth headset and it works really good
[14:15] <Riley88> it should be fine does it have its own dongle
[14:15] <Ronalds_M> tester, thats ubuntu 12.04 I have 12.10
[14:16] <atlef> Riley88, i think so
[14:16] <Ronalds_M> this possibility is not aveable in 12.10

[14:16] <brendan_> i just googled, ubuntu 12.04 server gui
[14:17] <Ronalds_M> If anybody considers upgrading xubuntu 12.04 with nvidia drivers to 12.10, I would consider it twice
[14:17] <devnull_> ah ... i need opengl 3 support .. maybe that is why my performance is off
[14:17] <Fieldy> what would be a good / proper place to put commands I'd like done just after networking setup? particularly my own firewall commands, so it would need to be after the existing firewall rules being applied (or better yet replacing them)
[14:17] <Riley88> and thats why im buying intel lol
[14:18] <Riley88> from now on
[14:18] <Ronalds_M> intel integrated cards has great support
[14:18] <Pbwizkid> i agree
[14:18] <devnull_> fieldy ... if-up ?
[14:18] <Riley88> yea my old laptop had ati 4200 and it was terrible
[14:18] <mks1209> hi all, can someone help me with this... http://paste.ubuntu.com/1509640/
[14:18] <Pbwizkid> i have always been a big fan of AMD but not so much anymore
[14:18] <Fieldy> devnull_: i'm new at ubuntu, is that a command or a file somewhere?
[14:18] <Riley88> i always had issues
[14:19] <devnull_> Ronalds_M, nvidia just released a driver fix to increase performance by 40%
[14:19] <Pbwizkid> i am running a 4200 right now it it works fine just cant do any gameing or anything like that on it
[14:19] <tester> Ronalds_M, they have changed the settings, wait a moment
[14:19] <devnull_> Fieldy, check /etc/network/
[14:19] <nOStahl> hi guys, I have a thinkpad r51 here that refuses to connect to wifi network, it tries to connect but then asks for password again. dmesg shows ipw2100 Cn't get TKIP countermeasures: crypt not set!  on the last line of Dmesg
[14:19] <Fieldy> devnull_: thanks!
[14:19] <nOStahl> any ideas i can check?
[14:19] <Riley88> well the radion driver was fine but it always over heated when i used the open source driver
[14:20] <Ronalds_M> maybe, but I lost all nvidia drivers+jockey-gtk + ability to install them
[14:20] <Pbwizkid> i have no problem with open source
[14:20] <devnull_> nvidia does a much better job with drivers than ati
[14:20] <Ronalds_M> so xubuntu upgrading is no need with nvidia
[14:20] <Fieldy> devnull_: fully agree
[14:20] <Pbwizkid> not on thier tegra stuff they dont
[14:20] <gepatino> mks1209, have you tried to run that as root? seems to be related to user rights, if it works with root, try assigning the user to dialup, network, serial, groups
[14:20] <devnull_> look at me i have to install an upstream kernel to use my radeon more efficiently
[14:21] <tester> has nobody an idea, if dconf settings file contains personal information?
[14:21] <mks1209> gepatino, thanks, but how do i run it as root
=== chiluk_away is now known as chiluk
[14:21] <Pbwizkid> but other than tegra nvidia is takeing the market on it back and running with it
[14:21] <mks1209> gepatino, i did add user mks to dialout
[14:21] <devnull_> steam on linux baby
[14:22] <gepatino> mks1209, use sudo to start the python interpreter: 'sudo python' then you'll have a python instance as root

[14:25] <Riley88> the only time i got grub2 to show up was after i wiped widows and reinstalled it
[14:25] <hje841> devnull_, gotcha
[14:26] <Ladillero> Riley88 I never had problems with W7, only drivers
[14:26] <Riley88> oh
[14:26] <Cong> lol
[14:26] <esteeven> Ubuntu 12.10 Unity < I have a problem with recover after suspend. I have graphics but no USB. I am using the standard kernel. Any ideas? Using 3.5.0-21-generic. It's an Intel box (USB, audio etc) and my graphics are NVIDIA using the radeon drivers.
[14:26] <Ladillero> I guess W8 is the one to blame lol
[14:26] <Riley88> did your come with 7 or 8
[14:26] <Ladillero> 8
[14:27] <Riley88> mine came with 7 but still had uefi
[14:27] <devnull_> why would you use radeon drivers for a Nvidia card ?
[14:27] <Ladillero> Interesting
[14:27] <ivotkl> See you, I'm offi.
[14:27] <BluesKaj> esteeven, radeon isn't nvidia , it's ati
[14:28] <tester> Ronalds_M, not possible, you would have to change the source :-(
[14:28] <devnull_> esteeven ... it is possible that could be part of the problem ... suspend is an iffy thing when it comes to graphics some times
[14:28] <esteeven> duh. I meant nouveau. :)
[14:29] <tester> Ronalds_M, someone has done this for ubuntu 12.04 unity (you have to install the ppa though)
[14:30] <devnull_> yea .. im gonna see how 3.8 performs for Radeon

[14:34] <Fieldy> devnull_: thanks a lot, placing it in if-up.d was exactly what I was looking for
[14:34] <Cong> I deleted the .Trash-xxxx folders and it won't delete subsequent files now.
[14:35] <devnull_> fieldy ... no problem ... there are a lot of things like that in linux that launch scripts .. always check in /etc
[14:35] <Fieldy> sure. I've been using linux for at least 15 years (I quit counting), i just was not sure precisely where in this distro
[14:35] <devnull_> cong ... unmount it and remount it and see if it helps
[14:35] <Cong> devnull_, tried it.
[14:36] <KsM> Ugh, I hated that nautilus just moves stuff on the usb rather than deleting it

[14:45] <Cong> DJones, lubuntu is lightweight. it doesn't make many of the stuff in a full ubuntu desktop.
[14:45] <devnull_> i forgot about all the different shells
[14:47] <bouli> Hello?
[14:47] <devnull_> hi
[14:47] <bouli> Dunno if i am in the right channel :)
[14:47] <DJones> Cong: I'm a few minutes away from finishing a fresh lubuntu install, I'll try it when I finish, I thought the printscreen key would take a screenshot
[14:47] <bouli> I wanted to find out more about  Ubuntu from those that use it
[14:47] <designbybeck> Greetings all, I'm trying to install Ubuntu on a Power Mac. It has 4 2TB drives. Do I do anything special to install Ubuntu? I have put rFEIt on there and I was able to boot off a disk and into Ubuntu. Just didn't know if it was safe to at a Ubuntu Partition or not?
[14:48] <designbybeck> bouli: ask away
[14:48] <bouli> Well, i have been a Windows user for years now.  But i have always been interested in trying Ubuntu, or Linux in General.  But my concern is, i like gaming lol :P
[14:49] <bouli> Now i have heard of wine
[14:49] <bouli> and stuff, but i am worried about drivers and such
[14:49] <Pbwizkid> steam on linux
[14:49] <designbybeck> Most, for now just dual boot bouli
[14:49] <devnull_> bouli ... what games ? i just installed steam
[14:49] <designbybeck> you can also try plays on linux bouli
[14:49] <bouli> Games like League of Legends :D
[14:49] <bouli> plays?
[14:49] <bouli> Dual booting sounds interesting. never considered that :/
[14:49] <designbybeck> yes also what Pbwizkid said... Steam now runs native on Ubuntu with more games coming
[14:49] <devnull_> bouli .. you can check to see if there is a linux version ... if not check the winehq to see if it is supported
[14:49] <Pbwizkid> play on linux is basically wine but more aimed and gameing
[14:50] <designbybeck> And did everyone see the new Steam box just annouced it runs Linux
[14:50] <designbybeck> as well as the New LEGO Mindstorm
[14:50] <bouli> Ahh, cool!
[14:50] <designbybeck> ok where was it
[14:50] <designbybeck> i
[14:50] <DJones> Cong: That surprised me, it doesn't take a screenshot by default
[14:50] <bouli> Well, it doesn't seem like Linux is far away from gaming that everyone made me beleive lo
[14:50] <designbybeck> yes
[14:50] <phill_> I have a confusing Ubuntu issue...
[14:50] <bouli> Guess i have to try out Ubuntu! :D
[14:50] <Cong> DJones, me, not surprised.
[14:50] <DJones> Heh
[14:50] <Pbwizkid> gameing has always been on linux just takes al ittle more work
[14:51] <devnull_> bouli ... no it is a lot better now than before ... like a lot better
[14:51] <designbybeck> bouli: best is to not listen to people that say "can't" and instead just go make it happen! ;)
[14:51] <Pbwizkid> all id software games have a had a linux installer
[14:51] <phill_> I want to change my users uid from 1000. I get an error from "usermod phill -u 61025"
[14:51] <phill_> usermod: user ptaylor is currently logged in
[14:51] <phill_> but I'm the only user and I can't log in as root
[14:51] <phill_> because it's disabled.
[14:51] <bouli> nice! :D

[14:52] <bazhang> phill_, there is NO reason to log in as root
[14:52] <designbybeck> Anyone know about my PowerMac question?
[14:52] <phill_> bazhang: thast's not the problem
[14:52] <Cong> should I get shutter? I donno it looks super heavyweight.
[14:52] <phill_> I can't use sudo because it means I AM LOGGED IN
[14:52] <devnull_> phill why are you trying to change your userid ?
[14:52] <designbybeck> Cong:  Shutter is great, but I haven't tried it on lower end machines
[14:52] <Third3ye> Has anybody noticed any issues relating to "rar" and "nautilus"?
[14:52] <devnull_> you could always boot into a root console i suppose
[14:52] <MonkeyDust> Cong  shutter isn't light, but you can edit screenshots with it
[14:52] <devnull_> Third3ye, not lately
[14:52] <phill_> devnull_: because I'm using the same account across NFS and want to match up the permissions correctly
[14:53] <designbybeck> Hey MonkeyDust did you see my post about installing Ubuntu on a Power Mac with  4 2TB harddrives?
[14:53] <devnull_> phill_, im sure bazhang  will have to correct way to do it ... but i think you can boot into a root terminal and do it
[14:53] <Third3ye> I left it overnight to archive a collection of folders filled with media -- when I woke up it was consuming large amount of CPU and ram, which left Unity inoperable, forcing me to reboot via terminal
[14:53] <MonkeyDust> designbybeck  i'm not familiar with Mac, sorry
[14:53] <designbybeck> It has rEFIt on there and can boot a ubuntu disk.... just didn't know if it was safe to do a refit partition
[14:53] <designbybeck> ah ok, no prob, thanks
[14:53] <bazhang> sudo -i for a root shell devnull_
[14:54] <DJones> Cong: Actually, just checking, the printscreen key does take a screenshot and saves in /home it just doesn't give me any indication that it has done it without looking in the /home folder
[14:54] <Third3ye> Is there a log for nautilus?
[14:54] <Cong> DJones, bingo!
[14:55] <devnull_> bazhang, doesn't that still keep your user active
[14:55] <Third3ye> I did an integrity check of the archived file now (a rar file) and everything seems to be in order
[14:55] <bazhang> devnull_, I've not been paying attention to his issue, my apologies
[14:55] <Third3ye> So it finished and continued to use a lot of CPU and ram
[14:56] <devnull_> no prob ... he can't change the user ID because his user is logged in / active
[14:56] <Cong> And I was about to get gnome-screenshot.
[14:56] <devnull_> thats why i was suggesting booting into maybe a low runlevel and doing it
[14:57] <devnull_> but brb

[15:00] <Cong> who wants too see? http://i48.tinypic.com/2guy7he.png
[15:00] <devnull_> alright .. booted right into 3.7.1 with no problem :)
[15:00] <llutz> phill_: enable root account, login as root, do your changes, lock root again
[15:01] <jhutchins_wk> phill_: By default you can't do that on ubuntu.
[15:01] <ikonia> phill_: why would you do that ?
[15:01] <just_trying_out> bazhang: not that......simple apt-get update being offline......like this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Offline/Repository
[15:01] <ikonia> phill_: you can just use sudo inline with the ubuntu security framework
[15:01] <just_trying_out> Robbilie: ^^
[15:01] <Cong> llutz do sudo -s # then type in your passwd
[15:01] <devnull_> lets try tf2 now
[15:02] <Cong> wrong person
[15:02] <llutz> Cong: read what he tries to do and then answer again
[15:03] <phill_> ikonia: because i need to run usermod on the only non root account on the box. usermod CANNOT WORK IF YOU USE IT VIA SUDO AND ARE CHANGING YOUR ACCOUNT
[15:03] <phill_> why do people keep asking?
[15:03] <bazhang> phill_, lose caps
[15:03] <llutz> phill_: btw it is a bad idea to mess with the only account on the system. if something breaks, you won't have any user to login. so temporary activating the root-account is imho an idea
[15:03] <devnull_> phill .... reboot and go to grub menu and see if there is an option to drop to boot to root console maybe
[15:04] <phill_> llutz: thanks
[15:04] <Cong> did anyone look at my pic? http://i48.tinypic.com/2guy7he.png
[15:04] <llutz> phill_: or if you prefer, create a 2nd account, add him to sudo-group and use that to do your changes
[15:04] <jhutchins_wk> phill_: What are you trying to change about your account?
[15:04] <Third3ye> Oh and can anyone suggest an alternative process manager that doesn't lock up?
[15:05] <phill_> jhutchins_wk: uid, so I can align file permissions on nfs with another account on the network
[15:05] <devnull_> phill ... or you can change it all manually
[15:05] <Third3ye> Preferably one with analytical data and several aspects around a process, like files in ram?
[15:05] <phill_> it's fine, i've enabled the root account..
[15:05] <phill_> off I go..
[15:06] <Third3ye> A GUI app... preferably, but I'm not to shy to use CLI :P

[15:19] <tompa_> Is there something wrong with the repos atm? I can't download ubuntu tweak or everpad... just gets "E: Unable to locate package everpad/ubuntu-tweak"
[15:20] <tompa_> Ubuntu 12.10 *
[15:20] <Pbwizkid> you need to go add the repos for those
[15:20] <MonkeyDust> jamie90234  fresh install is the fastest and easiest way - backup first
[15:20] <tompa_> how do i add repos?
[15:20] <Cong> sources-software
[15:20] <jamie90234> MonkeyDust thanks
[15:21] <Cong> you don't need a sources for tweak though
[15:21] <Pbwizkid> google the software repos and it will give you the commands
[15:22] <Pbwizkid> yes you do
[15:22] <Cong> I think it's in universe
[15:22] <ranjan> hi all, can anybody help me in troubleshooting unattended upgrades
[15:22] <Pbwizkid> i think it was at one time
[15:23] <Pbwizkid> just google how to insta ubuntu tweak on 12.10
[15:23] <Pbwizkid> that should get you everything you need
[15:23] <Pbwizkid> and as well with everpad
[15:23] <phill_> llutz: That worked thanks

[15:39] <tyler_d> I installed and was playing around with xfce, I have now moved back to gnome, however the panel indicator has multiples of icons for bluetooth, as well is missing the sound aplet all-together, I'm running 12.10 any help in getting the sound back and removing the duplicates would be great please
[15:40] <angs> how can I see if I have ftdi_sio driver?
[15:40] <bazhang> tyler_d, removing all of xubuntu? or only the applets
[15:40] <Cong> ## because it's server owned.
[15:40] <bazhang> Cong, thats not correct
[15:40] <Lardin> Irc Got a nice history...Anonymous started here
[15:40] <Cong> I guessed.
[15:40] <tyler_d> bazhang: i'm unsure why the aplets from xfce show in gnome... I would like to simply remove the aplets within gnome, not remove xfce

[15:41] <dr_willis> its not ##offtopic? ;-)
[15:42] <Cong> This bin isn't letting me remove the usb's contents that are in the bin sort of...
[15:42] <medfly> is it useless to try to ask overly specific questions about why apt has version conflicts of dependencies (apparently) here?
[15:42] <dr_willis> Cong: try removeing them as root?
[15:43] <dr_willis> medfly: conflucting ppas or repos most likely
[15:43] <medfly> I see
[15:43] <medfly> dr_willis: is there a way to reset those to default? I think I have way too much junk
[15:44] <dr_willis> !ppa-purge
[15:44] <ubottu> To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html

[16:08] <YolarP> Awesome guy.
[16:08] <LinSven> I *think* I heard today you can have as many partitions as you like with Linux if you use GPT. That 4 partition thing has to do with some old MicroSoft way of doing things. I have no idea what GPT is though haha.

[16:09] <daincredibleholg> LinSeven, this has nothing to do with M$. You can only have 4 primary partitions. If you want more, you need one extended partitions and put as many logical partitions in it, as you want.

[16:10] <daincredibleholg> no plan
[16:10] <LinSven> I am only asking because they talked about it in school today.
[16:10] <daincredibleholg> just create a extended partition and piut the logical ones in it
[16:11] <daincredibleholg> the only M$ restriction (was?), that Windows can only boot from primary partition

[16:13] <LinSven> I need to install Ubuntu here at home though.
[16:14] <magik_> LinSven, I would suggest the USB install make sure you do a full install.  If your going to do a dual boot is a good idea to make your partitions with windows before you install
[16:15] <LinSven> magik_ you know what. I think I am going to do that right now. I can put all my docs and stuff in the cloud.
[16:16] <LinSven> I'll be back in a while with a clean install of Ubuntu :)
[16:16] <magik_> LinSven, Can I suggest a youtube video that explains how to make the correct partitions or you already got that part down?

[16:33] <dr_willis> i use tools from the pendrive site. they have several
[16:33] <shipwash> I'm using this one: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/
[16:33] <shipwash> seems pretty straightforward, I just wanted to check
[16:34] <KaRmA> linux-image-3.5.0-21-generic is that newest 64 bit kernel ?
[16:36] <shipwash> okay, so if I use that pendrive tool, will the Home directory be persistent?
[16:38] <designbybeck> I got  Ubuntu installed on the MacPro, and it saw the wifi and i installed first round of updates no prob. But after reboot, now I can't connect to wifi or anything.
[16:38] <_Rocky_> installed a new ttf font by copying it into /usr/share/fonts and /usr/local/share/fonts. The font shows up in gnome-tweak-tool.But it doesn't show up in gnome-terminal profile preferences. Thank you for ideas.
[16:40] <_Rocky_> I am running ubuntu 12.04 with the 3.2.0-23-generic kernel
[16:40] <designbybeck> And what is the differnce between fglrx vs fflrx-updates? Which one do I need to install??
[16:40] <_Rocky_> I am using gnome-shell btw
=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[16:41] <blami> _Rocky_: only fixed size fonts are available in terminal
[16:42] <_Rocky_> designbybeck: http://askubuntu.com/questions/66707
[16:42] <joint2k> hello. i dont have uefi, or secure boot. I did a clean install of windows 8 - and now when i boot up ubuntu 11.10, 12.04, or 12.10 - the installer doesnt see any partitions at all. it just comes up blank. gparted sees them fine. anybody know anything about this. its a lot of info on google about it, but no straight answers.  why is windows 8 trying to hijack my hd?
[16:42] <joint2k> i even did a kill disk on my hd... and ubuntu still wont detect it
[16:42] <designbybeck> Thank you _Rocky_
[16:43] <_Rocky_> blami: Thank you. But, the same font works on gnome-terminal running on Debian Squeeze
[16:43] <_Rocky_> blami: any ideas?
[16:43] <joint2k> and i know it works.. because before i ever put windows 8 on there. i used to dual boot win 7 and ubuntu
[16:46] <joint2k> after the kill disk.. it seems the only option i have left is to wait for fedora 18, which allegidly has this new bootloader signed with microsoft keys
[16:46] <designbybeck> _Rocky_: my first question might not let me do your answer
[16:46] <joint2k> or buy a new hd
[16:46] <designbybeck> do you have to be online?
[16:47] <_Rocky_> designbybeck: you mean do you have to be online to install fglrx?
[16:47] <designbybeck> _Rocky_:  because if i try to select that fglrx, and click apply, it just goes back to the open source drivers
[16:47] <designbybeck> yes
[16:47] <designbybeck> i didn't know if the proprietary drivers were sitting there waiting offline _Rocky_
[16:47] <_Rocky_> If you are installing through the additional drivers, you will have to be online
[16:48] <_Rocky_> since it will be downloading the drivers
[16:48] <vfvrzvevrvzr> hi, how to take a file from a phone via bluetooth plz
[16:48] <Robbilie> vfvrzvevrvzr, might suggest blueman
[16:49] <KaRmA> how can I change the default kernel via command line ?
[16:49] <dr_willis> ive found its easier to send from the phone. not pull from the pc.
[16:49] <vfvrzvevrvzr> hi Robbiiie, ty for answer, I've apps from jde BLuedevil, must be like blueman hi, how to take a file from a phone via bluetooth plzbut what to do after?
[16:49] <rasp_pie> hi there! What's the problem when I cannot delete a folder (sudo rmdir srv)? It really looks strange, when I do a ls -lah, the folder shows up as "d????????? ? ?    ?       ?            ? srv"
[16:50] <_Rocky_> KaRmA: do you want to build a kernel or do you already have several kernels installed and you want to boot into oneby default?
[16:50] <designbybeck> well then back to my first question _Rocky_ New clean install on MacPro, Wifi worked when i installed, and did first updates just fine on wifi, but after reoobt I don't see wifi anymore, no networking
[16:50] <rasp_pie> Error message is "rmdir: failed to remove `srv': Device or resource busy"
[16:50] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, second option
[16:50] <dr_willis> rasp_pie:  ?? in names and stuff shows fs curruption.
[16:50] <_Rocky_> you would have to change grub config
[16:51] <rasp_pie> dr_willis: oh, that does not sound good. What chances do I have to fix it?
[16:51] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, so just change the line in /boot/grub/grub.cfg
[16:52] <dr_willis> rasp_pie: fsck from a live cd and see.
[16:52] <rasp_pie> yeah well, it's a productive server, running on xen... any other options that do not include reboot?
[16:53] <dr_willis> never used xen. so no idea
[16:53] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, k rebooting wish me luck
[16:53] <dr_willis> you  dont fsck a mounted fs nirmally
[16:53] <_Rocky_> KaRmA: Don't change grub.cfg. Since it will change back when you ubdate-grub
[16:54] <rasp_pie> ok. but do you have any idea how to check a mounted file system?
[16:54] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, I already did update-grub and it appeared to use the kernel I specified
[16:54] <rasp_pie> like what fsck would do
[16:54] <_Rocky_> KaRmA: set GRUB_DEFAULT=<index> to set the default boot in /etc/default/grub
[16:54] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, ok you were right it used the old kernel, what gives ?
[16:54] <dr_willis> rasp_pie:  if its mounted read only it might work
[16:55] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, ahh ok thanks
[16:55] <rasp_pie> dr_willis: nope, it's the root file system
[16:55] <rasp_pie> so it has to be rw
[16:55] <dr_willis> you DONT fs a in use rw fs. ;-)
[16:55] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, then do update-grub ?
[16:56] <dr_willis> dont fsck that is.. :-P
[16:56] <_Rocky_> KaRmA: yes
[16:56] <VictorCL> is there an easy way to install php oci8 extention?
[16:56] <rasp_pie> Ok. Then I just create a new folder. That one used to be only a mount point anyway so that should work
[16:57] <KaRmA> _Rocky_, that worked thanks!!!
[16:58] <rasp_pie> dr_willis: thanks anyway
[16:58] <rgummadavelli> need help
[16:59] <dr_willis> we need details...
[17:00] <chiluk> What are people doing to run Ubuntu as a KVM guest now that Unity is 3d only and runs like crap under KVM as a result?
[17:01] <MonkeyDust> chiluk  please rephrase that as a decent question
[17:01] <chiluk> unfortunately I'm using VMs as victims in order to debug graphics bugs... so ditching a window manager altogether is not an option.
[17:02] <chiluk> MonkeyDust,  What are people doing to run Ubuntu as a KVM guest now that Unity is 3d only and runs really slow under KVM as a result?
[17:02] <sgtkilljoy> chiluk: dont use unity ??
[17:02] <mz`> install gnome3 ? run KDE ? use a real DM/WM ?
[17:02] <mz`> dang.
[17:03] <chiluk> that's what I was afraid you guys would say.. Unfortunately I'm debugging some issues with Unity.
[17:03] <sgtkilljoy> << recommends cinnamon
[17:03] <datruth> how can I find out what is loading my iptables rules?
[17:03] <impiza> i have installed ubuntu software-center in linuxmint
[17:03] <vect0r> Has anyone had any luck getting opengl 3d accel to work running Ubuntu in VMWare Workstation 9?
[17:04] <mz`> datruth: syslog maybe
[17:04] <impiza> yo sgtkilljoy
[17:04] <impiza> but i cant see any commercial app in there why
[17:04] <mz`> impiza: you maybe missed some sources
[17:04] <MonkeyDust> impiza  mint is not supported in this channel
[17:04] <impiza> mz` what kind of source
[17:04] <impiza> i know
[17:05] <impiza> but i am asking help with ubuntu software-center
[17:05] <vfvrzvevrvzr> hi I don't know how to activate bluetooth with kde plz?*
[17:05] <AndChat330644> Hey guys this is probably a dumb one but if I wanted to manage a switch with ubuntu
[17:05] <mz`> APT sources
[17:05] <AndChat330644> What do I use
[17:06] <datruth> there was a simple firewall I had on ubuntu that I had to install
[17:06] <nullby7e> after a recompile of custom kernel, when i try to start X there is no desktop and icons in the screen, only background wallpaper
[17:06] <datruth> anyone know of what firewall it could have been?
[17:07] <nullby7e> also when i boot with default kernel it's the same
[17:07] <MonkeyDust> datruth  there's gufw
[17:07] <alnhavir> is there a way for me to disable password login after I've already installed Ubuntu? I want to boot straight to my desktop
[17:07] <robertzaccour> How do you add and remove icons to the home lens on the dash?
[17:08] <vfvrzvevrvzr> how to use bluetooth
[17:08] <MonkeyDust> alnhavir  system settings > user accounts > unlock
[17:08] <chiluk> AndChat330644 web browser?  telnet?  ssh?
[17:08] <datruth> MonkeyDust: firehol is what I was looking for
[17:08] <robertzaccour> alnhavir: yes, in user account settings
[17:10] <AndChat330644> Chiluk Web browser
[17:10] <chiluk> AndChat330644,  Firefox exists in Ubuntu...
[17:10] <chiluk> you might want to start there.
[17:10] <AndChat330644> Lol
[17:10] <chiluk> or are you having issues with java.
[17:11] <chiluk> if java's your pain.. I pitty you.
[17:11] <AndChat330644> Chiluk what i don't know is what tool to use. My switch is very old.
[17:11] <alnhavir> MonkeyDust: robertzaccour: I'm in those settings now, but can only change my name, account type, language and password. What am I missing?
[17:11] <nullby7e> after a recompile of custom kernel, when i try to start X there is no desktop and icons in the screen, only background wallpaper, also when i boot with default kernel it's the same?
[17:11] <chiluk> AndChat330644, If I were you I'd probably start with a quick download of it's manual.
[17:12] <robertzaccour> alnhavir: turn automatic login on
[17:12] <chiluk> and see what interfaces it supports
[17:12] <usr13> alnhavir: You are missing the auto-login option.  (I think you are in the wrong set of menus.)
[17:12] <chiluk> you might even want to try company support for that switch
[17:12] <MonkeyDust> alnhavir  unlock, then switch Automatic Login on/off, which you like
[17:12] <robertzaccour> alnhavir: just search for login and it should come up
[17:12] <robertzaccour> click it, then select automatic login on
[17:12] <chiluk>  AndChat330644 really there's not much Ubuntu related that we can advise on related to your random switch
[17:12] <chiluk> AndChat330644, usually they have either a web interface a telnet interface, or an ssh interface or some combination of the above.
[17:13] <chiluk> AndChat330644, you can always try nmap to try to discover what IPs are on your network ... or check your dhcp server logs to see if the switch grabbed an IP
[17:13] <chiluk> AndChat330644, am I helping at all?
[17:14] <chiluk> AndChat330644, your question felt a bit open ended.
[17:14] <robertzaccour> Is there a way to add and remove application icons from the Unity dash home lens?
[17:14] <alnhavir> robertzaccour: MonkeyDust: usr13 : Here's a screenshot of my User Accounts tab. Am I looking at the incorrect screen? http://i.imgur.com/2ne26.png
[17:14] <usr13> alnhavir:  http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/03/automatically-login-to-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/
[17:15] <robertzaccour> alnhavir: On mine right below password is the automatic login switch.
[17:15] <MonkeyDust> alnhavir  yeah, an option is missing there, no idea what might cause it
[17:16] <robertzaccour> alnhavir: at the top right click on lock and unlock it first
[17:17] <robertzaccour> alnhavir: It may be faster to just back up your home folder and do a reinstall and select login automatically during the setup maybe?
[17:17] <robertzaccour> only takes about 15 minutes to install Ubuntu
[17:17] <alnhavir> robertzaccour: MonkeyDust: Hm.. just installed today. The only thing I've done differently this time is enabled full disk encryption
[17:18] <MonkeyDust> alnhavir  i'm not familiar with encryption, but that may be it
[17:19] <MonkeyDust> alnhavir  makes sense: te decrypt/access the disk, you need a password
[17:19] <alnhavir> MonkeyDust: I'm not sure. The disk encryption is a different password that's entered at boot.
=== MartinS is now known as Guest51217
[17:20] <alnhavir> MonkeyDust: but then again, it's the only thing I've changed.
[17:21] <MonkeyDust> alnhavir  guess the decryption password is stored somewhere, a keyring or so, and you need a password to access that keyring
[17:24] <alnhavir> MonkeyDust: Hm.. This set-up (full disk encryption and automatic login) is an option on the install disk, which makes me think it should be possible to change this. I guess I'll just have to reinstall with that enabled.
[17:24] <alnhavir> MonkeyDust: It just sucks to enter two passwords to log in now (something I didn't foresee being this annoying)
[17:24] <alnhavir> MonkeyDust: thanks for your help!
[17:25] <KI4RO> Anyone know how to turn on the voice over feature in an IPOD thru UBUNTU?
[17:25] <usr13> alnhavir: Did you look at  http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/03/automatically-login-to-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/  ?
[17:26] <usr13> alnhavir: Is this a laptop or desktop?

[17:27] <alnhavir> usr13: laptop, but its the same image, isnt it?
[17:27] <robertzaccour> The music lens doesn't display or filter my music at all. Could this because I already have it organized in folders?
[17:27] <usr13> alnhavir: Just wondering why you were so security concious.
[17:28] <monk12> hey all, i'd like to get GPT/UEFI boot working... just curious before i'd setup linux with 4 partitions: /boot partition, /, /home, and linux-swap... i read i have to create a EFI partition at beginning of the drive ... would be become the /boot partition or is that separate?
[17:28] <robertzaccour> actually the music lens does display my music, but it doesn't filter it
[17:28] <robertzaccour> as in rock, country, etc
[17:28] <robertzaccour> is the music lens broken?
[17:29] <alnhavir> usr13: Gotcha. Well when it's as simple as checking a box on the newest installer, I figured why not? I have an SSD and still boot in <15 sec.
[17:29] <usr13> alnhavir: I have my laptop set to just boot to text mode, no login, I have to login and initiate the GUI as well, but if someone gets my laptop, they'll be pretty lost, so... I guess it's kinda worth it.  I can type in a password and give a command or two, doesn't bother me.
[17:29] <monk12> im at the screen at the instlal where i'll prob change the old hard drive so the /boot partition instead of 'ext4' becomes 'efi boot' partition... and then 'Device for Boot Loader installation:' would be set to that same 'efi boot' partition too?
=== root is now known as Guest33217
[17:30] <robertzaccour> man the Unity dash isn't ready for regular everyday use yet
[17:31] <dr_willis> one lens not working right is not a sign the dash is not ready..
[17:31] <monk12> also how does it become a GPT partition?
[17:31] <alnhavir> usr13: True. But FDE seems even more convenient then? Just prompted for a password at boot? The only inconvenient part is when you're like me and accidentally create two login screens when you implement
[17:31] <usr13> .... live and learn ....
[17:32] <alnhavir> usr13: :) will give your link a shot now. Thanks
[17:32] <usr13>  robertzaccour  xfce is
[17:32] <KI4RO> Anyone know how to turn on the voice over feature in an IPOD thru UBUNTU?
[17:32] <jennie> why at each boot I have to mount each partition ? I dont want to mount again and again
[17:32] <usr13> alnhavir: I dono if it will work for you, just found it, thought it might be useful/interesting.
[17:33] <dr_willis> jennie: make a fstab entry for them
[17:33] <dr_willis> !fstab | jennie
[17:33] <ubottu> jennie: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions

[17:33] <VictorCL> why do I get permission denied with this commnd
[17:33] <Third3ye> An activity/process manager... anybody got a good one to suggest?
[17:33] <VictorCL> sudo echo /opt/oracle/instantclient > /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient
[17:34] <Pici> VictorCL: sudo does not pass IO redirection operators. You're looking for echo /opt/oracle/instantclient | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient
[17:34] <llutz> VictorCL: echo /opt/oracle/instantclient |sudo tee -a  /etc/ld.so.conf.d/oracle-instantclient
[17:34] <dr_willis> because the echo has sudo rights. not the > redirection. You need to use somthing like the 'sudo tee' command
[17:34] <Pici> VictorCL: use -a if you want the equivalent of >>
[17:34] <iseer> When i boot normally i get stuck at a black screen (backlight on), however when i go through recovery mode and boot normally i can get in perfectly fine, can anybody help me?

[17:35] <dr_willis> !nomodeset | iseer
[17:35] <ubottu> iseer: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[17:35] <iseer> dr_willis: i have already attempted that but it is of no assistance as i can only get in and once i log out i get a pink screen and if i close my laptop screen i get another black screen with no backlight
[17:37] <VictorCL> echo extension=oci8.so >> /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini      .. permission denied
[17:37] <VictorCL> where do I put the sudo there?
[17:37] <bipul> i want to know is there any application in ubuntu whear i can see system,cpu temperature, network, disk usage,memory and many more on right side my screen something like this http://d.stavrovski.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/hackler-clean-2012.png
[17:37] <Pici> VictorCL: replace >> with sudo tee -a
[17:38] <dr_willis> closeing lid -> apci/powerdemon type issue.. not the same as booting up
[17:38] <ferro> ciao
[17:38] <VictorCL> ok thanks
[17:38] <ferro> ciao
[17:38] <cousteau> ok, so what's IBus and who decided it was good idea that it, being the default input method, should interpret ´+c as ç rather than ć ?
[17:38] <iseer> also willis, when i boot with nomodeset it says no discrete vga device detected but i know i have a discrete gpu

[17:51] <pinkpelican> I want to use dd to overwrite a USB stick, but can't remember how to locate partitions, usb locations, etc.
[17:51] <Third3ye> pinkpelican, use fdisk or cfdisk to find out
[17:52] <pinkpelican> Thank you.
[17:52] <pinkpelican> Is there any way to create a live usb from Ubuntu JeOS 8.04?
[17:53] <Soelen> hey ho, I have a problem! I couldnt write on my harddisk anymore, so I tired to restart, hanging on boot screen, got an "ubuntu swapper not tainted" error, on grub I changed to an old kernel and now it booted like it should have
[17:54] <Soelen> I never got this before, what is going on? Is my ugh, standard kernel broken?
[17:55] <Third3ye> Soelen, google dat sh*t
[17:56] <Soelen> but I did, I dont get a straight answer
[17:56] <MonkeyDust> !google | Third3ye
[17:56] <ubottu> Third3ye: While Google is useful for helpers, many newer users don't have the google-fu yet. Please don't tell people to "google it" when they ask a question.
[17:57] <Third3ye> google-fu? copy-paste errors?
[17:57] <Third3ye> Yeah alright... one sec :P
[17:57] <user82> hi. i have the problem that with hdmi i get no real black color on my screen (might be the typical 16-235 black value issue?). can i change that somehow?
[18:00] <Third3ye> Soelen, try uploading the syslog (/var/log/syslog.X) to pastebin -- the X stands for the number of times since you booted since then, starting from 0. Say you've booted three times, it's syslog.2
[18:00] <Soelen> alright
[18:01] <llutz> Third3ye: the X stands for the number the logfile has been rotated by logrotate, which isn't necessarily every reboot
[18:02] <Third3ye> My bad -- I just assumed ^
[18:02] <Third3ye> pinkpelican, just use dd to write the iso. Like this -> sudo dd if=windows7.iso of=/dev/sdX
[18:02] <Soelen> so what exactly do I need to pastebin, sylog or syslog.1?
[18:02] <Soelen> Third3ye:
[18:05] <Third3ye> Soelen, after reading a bit it depends... was the computer on for a _really_ long time? Apparently it rotates based on file size and when it's run... can anyone shed some light to this? I'm fairly new to logrotate
[18:06] <Third3ye> Soelen, you can do this cat syslog.0 |grep "ubuntu swapper not tainted" -- or exactly what the error was
[18:07] <xibalba> is there a way to re-nice a bunch of processes en-mass? i have 5 sshd proccesses id like to renice to 20
[18:07] <Soelen> Third3ye: not in syslog nor syslog.1 is tainted appearing
[18:08] <Third3ye> Soelen, how about dmesg?
[18:08] <Third3ye> though I think dmesg is omitted to the syslog..
[18:08] <Third3ye> Soelen, or kern.log
[18:09] <pinkpelican> Third3ye I'm running from Windows 7 right now. I want to make a live usb of ubuntu (as small as possible) and then use the usb to overwrite a hard disk on another computer. I know what command overwrites, but not which comman lists and and which choses partitions or disks to overwrite.
[18:09] <pinkpelican> Wait, just lists.
[18:09] <jrib>   xibalba did you check the man page for renice?
[18:09] <pinkpelican> You chose in the overwrite command.

[18:10] <Third3ye> pinkpelican, you're doing this from a windows 7 installation?
[18:10] <UmBsublime> is it possible that the ubuntu site has a broken link because when you try to download ubuntu 12.10 64-bit you actualy download the 12.04 64 bit .iso file
[18:11] <pinkpelican> I'm building the usb from a windows installation.

[18:13] <MonkeyDust> pinkpelican  better ask in ##windows, i guess
[18:13] <BluesKaj> UmBsublime, http://releases.ubuntu.com/quantal/
[18:13] <Soelen> Third3ye: also not in boot, boot.log, damn, boot.long sounded very promising
[18:13] <pinkpelican> I created a live usb of Ubuntu JeOS, but it's not letting me run JeOS without installing, and it's treating the install as from CD instead of USB.
[18:14] <MonkeyDust> pinkpelican  and JeOS is not supported here
[18:14] <pinkpelican> Ie I can't install JeOS from live usb.
[18:14] <UmBsublime> BlueKaj, thank you
[18:14] <pinkpelican> Which Ubuntu version is the smallest that allows for running live without installing, from either CD or USB?
[18:15] <MonkeyDust> !mini | pinkpelican
[18:15] <ubottu> pinkpelican: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[18:15] <WXZ> I've got two monitors setup and there's 4 workspaces on one, and 6 spaces on the other. Which is amazing, but I have no way to move windows between workspaces.

[18:19] <Third3ye> UmBsublime, I used the amd64 on my Core2 64bit -- and the kernel is running x86_64 :)
[18:19] <WXZ> UmBsublime: doesn't work
[18:19] <WXZ> UmBsublime: it's not a spanning desktop, it's a multi-desktop
[18:19] <tompa_> For some reason i must have changed some settings yesterday since i get errors from MyUnity when I'm trying to install Ubuntu tweaks, skype, everpad...

[18:20] <tompa_> What should i do to fix that?
[18:20] <UmBsublime> i know it works for me though
[18:20] <UmBsublime> ty thirdeye do you think i will get same results with i7 2600k?
[18:21] <acovrig> after the install, I would like to switch mail from local only to internet host, how do I do that?
[18:21] <MonkeyDust> tompa_  ppa's are not supported and i guess myUnity is no longer maintained or developped
[18:21] <WXZ> UmBsublime: really? You have like two different desktops?
[18:22] <UmBsublime> WXY, i have 4 actualy
[18:22] <Third3ye> UmBsublime, I should think so -- if I'm not mistaken the livecd runs a similar version to the kernel, at least the architecture, that you will be installing
[18:22] <tompa_> monkeydust but i was trying to install myunity yesterday and are still getting errors from it even if it doesnt have anything to do with skype for example... :S
[18:22] <Third3ye> So if it doesn't boot you'll at least know :)
[18:22] <UmBsublime> thanks
[18:22] <acovrig> that was odd
[18:23] <MonkeyDust> tompa_  skype? it says myUnity in the pastebin
[18:23] <tompa_> monkeydust yea exactly :/ 2 secounds i give u full pastebin

[18:24] <nOStahl> hey guys, my ethernet and wifi are eth2 and eth3   what happened during this fresh install that would cause that?
[18:24] <nOStahl> it also is not letting wifi connect, just times out and asks for password again but the password is correct.
[18:24] <nOStahl> dmesg talks about it not finding the password
[18:24] <nOStahl> thinkpad r51 laptop is what I'm setting up on
[18:24] <tangobravo> nOStahl, i am not sure what the issue is... they are suppose to be eth 2 and 3
[18:24] <nibbler> hi. if i run bcache with dm-crypt, which layer should be lower?
[18:25] <tangobravo> was it labeled something different before?
[18:25] <nOStahl> should be eth0 and wlan0
[18:25] <tangobravo> oh yea u are right
[18:25] <tangobravo> my fault
[18:25] <nOStahl> on every other install i've done
[18:25] <tangobravo> i have a server with multiple nics
[18:25] <tangobravo> you can change it in the udev rules file
[18:26] <nOStahl> is there a way I can uninstall the adapter and reinstall it
[18:26] <tompa_> monkeydust http://paste.ubuntu.com/1510180/
[18:26] <tangobravo>  /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules is where you would change it...
[18:26] <tangobravo> in terms of uninstalling and reinstalling i dont think that'd make a difference
[18:27] <tangobravo> is this a new install nOStahl ?
[18:27] <nOStahl> ya
[18:27] <tompa_> monkeydust in row 1 and 16 you can see im trying to install everpad and get errors from myunity...
[18:27] <tangobravo> look in the udev rules do u see wlan0 in there anywhere?
[18:27] <MonkeyDust> tompa_  i can just repeat what i just said: with ppas, you're on your own, use it at your own risk - and myUnity is no longer maintained, ie, no longer exists
[18:27] <nOStahl> the laptop had a bios password so I couldn't select boot device, so I installed ubuntu on another thinkpad r51 and then swapped the hd back into it
[18:27] <tangobravo> oh
[18:27] <tangobravo> well that could be an issue
[18:28] <tangobravo> what kind of laptop is it?
[18:28] <tangobravo> the one with a bios password
[18:28] <nOStahl> thinkpad r51
[18:28] <tompa_> monkeydust uhm i barley know what ppa is so if i have by misstake changed something how do i get back to default?
[18:28] <DX099> nOStahl, since you could change the HDD ? couldn't you go as far as resetting BIOS ?
[18:28] <nOStahl> I don't feel like making the serial adapter and soldering to the mono to reset it hehe
[18:28] <nOStahl> mobo
[18:28] <tangobravo> DX099 no... the bios password isnt related to the hard drive
[18:29] <MonkeyDust> tompa_  better contact the maintainer(s) of the ppas, they should know what to do
[18:29] <tangobravo> it's part of the mobo
[18:29] <nOStahl> k in that udev rules.d I see 4 adapters
[18:29] <nOStahl> the first two were prob from the original machine installation
[18:29] <tangobravo> which are?
[18:29] <tompa_> monkey hmm :/ okey thank you for answering!
[18:29] <nOStahl> eth0 is the ethernet and eth1 uses the ipw2200 driver.
[18:29] <tangobravo> do u know if the MAC addresses for the one in your current machine are?
[18:30] <DX099> tangobravo, no but as he/she got physic access so machine and could go as far as swapping HDDs, why no got the easiest way (IMO) and hard-reset the BIOS ?
[18:30] <nOStahl> if I delete this udev rules file will it recreate it upon bootup
[18:30] <tangobravo> i dunno
[18:31] <nOStahl> I think it does
[18:31] <tangobravo> DX099 resetting a bios password is not easy
[18:31] <tangobravo> at least not on a laptop
[18:31] <nOStahl> for these think pads you have to order a chip if I remember right
[18:31] <nOStahl> and do some soldering
[18:31] <tangobravo> if you dont know the original you gotta solder an rs232 connector and connect a chip to a couple pin outs on the board
[18:32] <DX099> isn't it just some battery to remove somewhere ?
[18:32] <tangobravo> it's an ATMEL EEPROM chip
[18:32] <tangobravo> no DX099
[18:32] <DX099> ok
[18:32] <tangobravo> those days have been long gone
[18:32] <ActionParsnip> Tangobravo: replace the bios battery with mains power disconnected will do it if you leave it out a good while
[18:32] <tangobravo> there is an actual ROM on the board small amount of storage (kinda like a flash memory if you will) that is encrypted that stores that info
[18:33] <tangobravo> not sure ActionParsnip if that'd do it on the thinkpads
[18:33] <nOStahl> there is a chip on these mobo's that holds the data
[18:33] <nOStahl> its not able to be done with any power tricks :)
[18:33] <tangobravo> yea even my dell laptop cant be done that way
[18:34] <tangobravo> someone invented some tool i heard but i never used it
[18:34] <DX099> ActionParsnip, isn't there also some : remove the battery, plug out the laptop, push the power button for X seconds" another trick to reset BIOS settings ?
[18:34] <tangobravo> it's software based
[18:34] <ActionParsnip> Tangobravo: worth a shot.  Quick and dirty
[18:34] <ActionParsnip> Dx099: I'd try it
[18:35] <tangobravo> ActionParsnip, i remember a power on and off trick would work with a boot password
[18:35] <ActionParsnip> Dx099 : leave it out a good half hour
[18:35] <tangobravo> i dunno if it'll work tho for the supervisor password (which is what you need to do for the boot order)
[18:35] <tangobravo> the supervisor password is different than a boot password
[18:36] <tangobravo> this is how'd you do it for the boot password though    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HRjUK1IB84
[18:36] <ActionParsnip> Not 100% here either.  Worth a punt
[18:36] <tangobravo> his best bet would be to find the backdoor password for his system
[18:37] <nOStahl> k removed that udev rule and rebooted
[18:37] <tangobravo> not all machines have one tho
[18:37] <ActionParsnip> Could research it while the power drains
[18:37] <tangobravo> nOStahl, did you back it up?
[18:37] <nOStahl> and it re-created it properly with the right names and such for this device
[18:37] <nOStahl> yes
[18:37] <tangobravo> good lol
[18:37] <tangobravo> oh that's good
[18:37] <nOStahl> didn't need too though, i've deleted that file on a virtual machine before to fix an issue it had
[18:37] <nOStahl> heh
[18:37] <tangobravo> didnt know if it'd recreate it or not
[18:38] <nOStahl> when switching to a new host box
[18:38] <nOStahl> still no affect anyways, won't connect

[18:42] <Pici> ActionParsnip: They might both seek to solve user questions, but they are not the same thing and also keep in mind that launchpad is used for far more than just Ubuntu.
[18:42] <DX099> as for BIOS thingy, I once came across those: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1510218/ Never used it though...

[19:02] <Pici> MonkeyDust: er, I don't think that will work
[19:02] <pinkpelican> Thank you.
[19:02] <DX099> pinkpelican, you could have added "bs=512", but your command also do the job.
[19:03] <Pici> pinkpelican: you'd need to send it a USR1 signal to have it print out its progress. use kill -USR1 with the pid of your dd process.
[19:03] <pinkpelican> I thought bs=512 set the size of the overwrite
[19:03] <pinkpelican> I don't know what a pid is.
[19:03] <Pici> pinkpelican: using `watch` will just run the command again every 2 seconds.
[19:03] <pinkpelican> Oh
[19:04] <Pici> pinkpelican: either look it up via `ps aux | grep dd` or see `pidof dd`
[19:04] <pinkpelican> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda kill -USR1
[19:04] <MonkeyDust> Pici  pinkpelican I use watch to see copy progress, wasn't aware of the USR1 thingy

[19:40] <jamescarr> hey, any idea why running this: sudo -u elasticsearch -s "ulimit -Sn" would give me " /bin/bash: ulimit -Sn: command not found

[19:41] <jrib> jamescarr: try without the quotes maybe
[19:42] <kslater> hey all
[19:42] <pinkpelican> Hello
[19:42] <xutwooh> hi
[19:42] <kslater> I'm going to ask this question again today, because I *know* someone knows the answer
[19:43] <kslater> Where / how is mounting of usb external devices controlled?
[19:43] <jrib> 42
[19:43] <pinkpelican> Which OS is best?!
[19:43] <kslater> Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS
[19:43] <jamescarr> pinkpelican:  GNU Hurd
[19:43] <kslater> Plan 9
[19:43] <xangua> !ot | pinkpelican jamescarr
[19:43] <ubottu> pinkpelican jamescarr: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[19:44] <jrib> kslater: why do you ask?
[19:44] <toxboi> kslater: afaik, it's upstart
[19:44] <xutwooh> pinkpelican: depends your linux level, ubuntu is for easier transition from windows OS to linux
[19:45] <xutwooh> if your smart or know alot of computers, arch linux gentoo are for high levelers
[19:45] <pinkpelican> My comp sci lv is zilch.
[19:45] <kslater> because I have an internal drive with 2 partitions that show up as USB devices. I need them to be put back in the right place on boot.
[19:45] <jrib> kslater: what does it mean to "show up as USB devices"?
[19:45] <kslater> Actually, scratch that. They aren't / don't show up as USB devices
[19:45] <jrib> and what is "the right place on boot"?
[19:45] <kslater> that's my backup drive
[19:46] <kslater> the right place is one of them mounts at /media/extra and the other at /media/extra/source
[19:46] <toxboi> kslater: you need to make a fstab entry
[19:46] <kslater> but they are internal partitions of my main drive. fstab is the right place.
[19:46] <jrib> kslater: if you want them to mount automatically at boot, you should create an fstab entry as toxboi points out (see ubottu)
[19:46] <kslater> but what about the 2T external drive?
[19:46] <jrib> !fstab | kslater
[19:46] <ubottu> kslater: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[19:47] <jrib> kslater: what about the 2T external drive?
[19:47] <kslater> so that needs to be mounted where it's expected as well
[19:47] <gsant> hi everyone
[19:47] <kslater> /media/seagate2t and not /media/usbN
[19:48] <gsant> has anyone installed Ubuntu on those preinstalled Win 8 with UEFI and boot secure ?
[19:48] <kslater> but it's not always present as this machine in question is a laptop with a docking station. Which is where the 2T drive is connected.
[19:48] <jaybutts> LAN works on my wifi adapter, I am using dhcp and internet works on other devices using those settings however internet doesn't work over my wifi adapter only lan while internet works fine over eth0 wired connection, anyone have an idea?
[19:48] <jrib> kslater: ok, you can use fstab for that too if you want it to be automatically mounted when you boot.  But you should add a parameter for boot to not fail if it fails to mount (because it isn't plugged in for example).  Alternatively, just give it the label "seagate2t" and it will get mounted to /media/seagate2t by nautilus when you click on it in nautilus
[19:49] <gsant> i just bought a sony vaio that cames with Win 8 preloaded ..and the Bios was replaced by UEFI;
[19:49] <xutwooh> kslater: if your putting a linux operating system on a usb flashdrive look up the program UNETBOOTIN that should help if thats what your asking
[19:49] <atlef> !uefi | gsant
[19:49] <ubottu> gsant: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[19:50] <kslater> not a USB flashdrive. 2T USB flashdrive? That would be interesting I guess.
[19:50] <toxboi> kslater: in your case, a UUID would be a nice option. Using device name /dev/sdxx is not a good idea as it may change in presence of a extra device. Eg. a USD disk.
[19:50] <kslater> this is just external space
[19:50] <kslater> toxboi: I was justs noticing that from fstab
[19:51] <jrib> uuid should be used anyway, /dev/sdX isn't guaranteed to stay the same
[19:51] <toxboi> ^ second that
[19:51] <gsant> ok thank you i will try taht
[19:52] <kslater> where are drives labeled?
[19:52] <jrib> !label | kslater
[19:52] <jaybutts> anyone know why my wifi interface works fine on lan but not internet and I am using identical dhcp settings as other devices, wired connection to same router works fine on this machine
[19:52] <ubottu> kslater: To rename the labels of your partitions, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RenameUSBDrive.
[19:52] <kslater> if it's in the properties page, it's not obvious
[19:52] <kslater> gparted, of course

[19:53] <kslater> !UDID
[19:53] <atlef> !uuid | kslater
[19:53] <ubottu> kslater: To see a list of your devices/partitions and their corresponding UUID's, run this command in a !shell: « sudo blkid » (see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LibAtaForAtaDisks for the rationale behind the transition to UUID)

[19:54] <melkor> I have a strange issue where sometimes my sounds stop working. When I go to sound settings there are new options compared to when the sounds worked.
[19:54] <melkor> Is there anyway I can restart my sounds?
[19:54] <atlef> !sound | melkor
[19:54] <ubottu> melkor: If you're having problems with sound, click the Volume applet, then Sound Preferences, and check your Volume, Hardware, Input, and Output settings.  If that fails, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Sound - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting - http://alsa.opensrc.org/DmixPlugin - For playing audio files,  see !players and !mp3.

[21:07] <ActionParsnip> wbf: any output?
[21:07] <huttala> Then the splash screen shows, but it just loads for hours

[21:08] <blim> are you guys running 12.10 and installing amd drivers by any chance, because I had problems then I went back to 12.04 and all is good now
[21:08] <wbf> ActionParsnip, No
[21:08] <huttala> blim, I'm using 12.04 64-bit
[21:09] <ActionParsnip> wbf: ok, run:  sudo modprobe -r bcm203x

[21:09] <ActionParsnip> wbf: personally, I'd just buy a new one which is known to work. The one you have seems to need ndiswrapper
[21:10] <bobweaver> That is it I am re-writing these libs No one should have to go through this
[21:10] <Snablers> blim, yes
[21:10] <blim> Im just saying because 12.10 does not support amd drivers
[21:11] <ActionParsnip> blim: depends on the amd chip used
[21:11] <Snablers> blim, ok, i guess i'll try going back to 12.04 :/
[21:11] <alexxxxxa> Hello! I can't use my TV as a monitor. I connected it via VGA cable. It doesnt display.ž

[21:11] <Stalowy_Alchemik> :)
[21:11] <blim> well my 6950 didnt work ether
[21:12] <m477> df command will show me unmounted drive?
[21:12] <ActionParsnip> blim: Snablers there is a PPA to work around it, may help
[21:12] <ActionParsnip> m477: you don't mount drives
[21:12] <blim> I tryed to get help here on the matter and got shouted at XD
[21:12] <Snablers> ActionParsnip: sorry, what is a PPA? i'm not familiar with that term.

[21:13] <m477> what is it
[21:14] <blim> Im good but thanks, things are working great for me now. just trying to get the sound working in doom. Ive got the alsa oss installed and tryed all the start commands but no luck
[21:14] <blim> doom3*
[21:14] <ActionParsnip> m477: it still has a partition on it, even if it takes 100% of the drive space
[21:14] <Snablers> i guess i should stick with 12.04 for now. the last thing i need right now is for my card to overheat and die.
[21:15] <ActionParsnip> m477: if you run:  sudo fdisk -l    you will see the drives and partitions visible to the kernel.
[21:15] <blim> have you tryed amdoverdrive?
[21:15] <m477> ActionParsnip: ok thanks
[21:15] <ActionParsnip> m477: I believe you need to have them mounted to see the free space (gparted may be able to show you the used / free space)
[21:15] <Snablers> no, does that not require the drivers to be installed first?

[21:23] <Travis-42> I am able to login to my ubuntu server locally, but when I try to ssh to it, I get permission denied after entering my password. Where might I have misconfigured it? (And I'm sure I'm entering the right password)
[21:23] <m477> ActionParsnip: do you wanna see?
[21:23] <ActionParsnip> wbf: then you may have to accommodate your ARM CPU by buying super linux friendly hardware, or compile ndiswrapper
[21:24] <ActionParsnip> m477: sure, use a pastebin
[21:24] <woo> Travis-42: both ubuntu boxes?
[21:24] <wbf> ActionParsnip, I think I found the solution to my problem.
[21:24] <Travis-42> Travis-42: I've tried sshing in from an ubuntu box and from a mac, I don't think that's the problem
[21:25] <Travis-42> err, @woo
[21:25] <woo> Travis-42: did you add the rsa key and configure the mac firewalls.  I had issues with ssh -X with mac
[21:25] <m477> ActionParsnip: here you go: http://pastebin.com/dBEkjSvV
[21:26] <blackline> For some reason I uninstalled the Archive Manager first installed with Ubuntu 12.10. I've reinstalled it and wonder if someone know how to get the "right click - Extract" function in the desktop environment back? It didn't return after reinstalling.
[21:26] <medfly> how can I start X normally from command line?
[21:26] <Travis-42> woo: I was having trouble with the rsa key, so I changed it back to try allowing password logins
[21:26] <SonikkuAmerica> medfly: sudo startx
[21:27] <medfly> SonikkuAmerica: it says no screens found.
[21:27] <Dexx1_> anyone use XBMC ? I just installed it and its so laggy and mouse does not work..any ideas?
[21:27] <medfly> I was hoping it is just the wrong command :-)
[21:27] <woo> Travis-42: did you try to mv ssh_config to .ssh_config and make a new ssh_config file?  Sometimes it does't like diffrent mac addresses on the same IP address
[21:27] <ServerSage> Dexx1_: What's your hardware?
[21:27] <b33m> @Dexx1 go with plex
[21:27] <SonikkuAmerica> medfly: Ok, do you have a window manager installed?
[21:27] <b33m> it's a fork off XBMC and much nicer
[21:27] <medfly> SonikkuAmerica: yes. I just had trouble booting up (it got stuck). I booted from recovery mode, then asked it to resume normally.
[21:28] <medfly> SonikkuAmerica: it resulted in something without X.
[21:28] <medfly> this might be normal, though
[21:28] <Travis-42> woo: how do I make it generate a new file?
[21:28] <woo> Travis-42: touch > ssh_config
[21:28] <SonikkuAmerica> medfly: And after rebooting it, what happened?
[21:29] <medfly> SonikkuAmerica: should I try to reboot it again? I haven't made any changes.
[21:29] <Travis-42> woo: ah, you mean just a blank one. ok I'll try this
[21:29] <woo> ya
[21:29] <medfly> I will give it a shot

[21:29] <Dexx1_> b33m: whell I installed XMBCUbuntu
[21:29] <ServerSage> Dexx1_: It's probably the 64mb of video killing you.
[21:30] <b33m> yeah
[21:30] <b33m> way too little video memory
[21:30] <woo> Travis-42: touch ssh_config * sry
[21:30] <jhutchins_wk> wbf: Why does it matter where the drivers are?  They're in library paths depending on where they come from.  What are you really asking?
[21:30] <wbf> jhutchins_wk, Asking where to download
[21:30] <wbf> jhutchins_wk, I need them for ubuntu on my UG802 and it's based on armhf
[21:31] <jhutchins_wk> wbf: You don't download packages for ubuntu, you use the package manager to install them.
[21:31] <WXZ> ok, I can't find many references on this. but I've got the amd catalyst driver, how do I move windows between desktops (not xinerama, it's not a spanning desktop, it's a multi-desktop)?
[21:31] <jhutchins_wk> wbf: Yeah, I caught that earlier, but thanks for clarifying.

[21:32] <jhutchins_wk> ?
[21:32] <raven_> any ideas?
[21:32] <jhutchins_wk> wbf: There are some tools that let you do that easily - what does your connected system run?
[21:32] <ActionParsnip> raven_: mencoder can tell you. You will need a litte bash loop if mencoder doesn't allow globbing
[21:32] <ServerSage> raven_: mencoder, mp3info both can do it.
[21:32] <medfly> SonikkuAmerica: it is still causing the same problems. stuck. if I press power button it even shuts itself down "cleanly".

[21:33] <AlphaS> ActionParsnip 12.10 then
[21:33] <AlphaS> can u please help me ?
[21:33] <jhutchins_wk> wbf: Still, it should have the modules included in the source, it's just a matter of including them in the build.
[21:33] <wbf> jhutchins_wk, -_- but the kernel is already installed
[21:34] <m477> ActionParsnip: did you see the link?
[21:34] <jhutchins_wk> wbf: Did you build it or download it?

[21:38] <wbf> Bye then.
[21:38] <jhutchins_wk> wbf: I really couldn't give a crap what you do.  Nobody here has any obligation to help you.  You're getting answers that apply to stock Ubuntu.  That's not what you have, and it's not our fault the answers don't apply.  I would suggest you go to the source of your custom code for support.  There's no way the people here are going to know answers for it except by random chance.

[21:40] <medfly> OK. I have had some success with renaming my xorg.conf file
[21:41] <WXZ> ok, I can't find many references on this. but I've got the amd catalyst driver, how do I move windows between desktops (not xinerama, it's not a spanning desktop, it's a multi-desktop)?
[21:42] <SonikkuAmerica> medfly: Any luck with that?
[21:42] <jhutchins_wk> WXZ: That would depend not on the hardware but on the window manager you're running (Gnome? Unity?)
[21:42] <WXZ> jhutchins_wk: Gnome
[21:43] <ActionParsnip> !proxy
[21:43] <ubottu> Several Ubuntu channels prohibit access from open proxies and other anonymous connections due to a high level of abuse. The supported ways to hide your IP address on freenode are to use !Tor or get a !cloak

[21:44] <ActionParsnip> Dexx1_: its a completely different OS with completely differet support
[21:45] <WXZ> jhutchins_wk: multi-desktop (yes I haven't heard of it before) is like two different desktops, each one has it's own panel apps and workspaces
[21:45] <Dexx1_> ActionParsnip: are there anything out there that will help me make this machine a media server that is similar to xbmc?
[21:45] <jhutchins_wk> WXZ: So you want the system to treat the two desktops as different workspaces like they would be on a multi-desktop single-display?

[21:46] <ActionParsnip> Dexx1_: boxee, plex
[21:46] <jhutchins_wk> WXZ: My guess would be you need a second instance of X running and outputing to the second display.  I don't think Gnome has any way to do that but that could be my ignorance.
[21:46] <SonikkuAmerica> medfly: You're welcome, glad it worked! (Your friend was right... if all else fails graphics wise, purge your xorg.conf)
[21:47] <jhutchins_wk> WXZ: You might find some answers by looking for info on "multi-seat" linux.
[21:47] <WXZ> jhutchins_wk: I think a second instance of X is already running somehow, I don't know, AMD is some proprietary stuff

[21:53] <David_N> Hello. I am deploying Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on a dedicated server (Intel Core2Quad 2.+Ghz. 8GB PC2-5400 DDR2. 2x 500GB+ SATA in RAID1. 5000GB transfer allowance /month.), should I use the 32-bit or 64-bit version?
[21:54] <SonikkuAmerica> ztgu: How old is the laptop?
[21:54] <jhutchins_wk> m477: So something like dmesg |grep -i USB would be useful.
[21:54] <bekks> David_N: 64bit.
[21:54] <m477> jhutchins_wk: I did the following instruction: run:  sudo dmesg clear    then unplug and replug it in, then run: dmesg
[21:54] <David_N> bekks: Thanks, I remember asking a year or so ago and people said "Use 32-bit on a server.", can't remember why.
[21:54] <ztgu> SonikkuAmerica: It was released two months ago or something like that
[21:54] <nimrod10> anyone knows what is the upstart alternative to the old  rc.local ?
[21:54] <ActionParsnip> m477: is it an encrypted partition?
[21:54] <jhutchins_wk> m477: So relelvant messages should be at the end of dmesg.
[21:55] <ActionParsnip> nimrod10: rc.local still gets used
[21:55] <David_N> Is ufw enabled by default?
[21:55] <m477> ActionParsnip: it isnt, I tihnk
[21:55] <nimrod10> ActionParsnip,  hmm , I have a few powertop commands in it that don't seem to happen
[21:55] <jhutchins_wk> m477: The pastebin doesn't show that happening.
[21:55] <ActionParsnip> m477: I have no experience of it. Too many headaches
[21:55] <ActionParsnip> m477: the last 2 entries are useful
[21:56] <SonikkuAmerica> ztgu: So what happens if you try to suspend
[21:56] <jhutchins_wk> ActionParsnip: I don't think they're the drive.
[21:56] <m477> jhutchins_wk: what happening?
[21:56] <m477> ActionParsnip: which ones
=== cal is now known as Guest3160
[21:56] <ActionParsnip> nimrod10: if you add the command:   echo "test" | tee /home/yourname/Desktop/text.txt > /dev/null        above the exit 0 line and reboot, does the file get created?
[21:56] <ActionParsnip> m477: both
[21:57] <ActionParsnip> nimrod10: obviously change the username to your user's
[21:57] <m477> jhutchins_wk: output of the dmesg |grep -i USB  http://pastebin.com/iC2NC3ay
[21:57] <ztgu> SonikkuAmerica: The suspend it successful, like I can see in the log, but on resume my screen stays black. I can turn the system off with ctrl + alt + del..
[21:57] <nimrod10> ActionParsnip, that is the next thing I've just done, each file rc.local & /etc/init/local.conf shall touch a file in /var/tmp . See you after a reboot
[21:57] <Dexx1_> ActionParsnip: I think it's a driver/OpenGL issue
[21:57] <Dexx1_> just not sure how to fix it
[21:57] <m477> ActionParsnip: sorry I dont follow about which entries, you are talking about
[21:58] <jhutchins_wk> m477: No storage devices there.
=== nimrod10 is now known as nimrod_afk
[21:58] <jhutchins_wk> m477: I thought you said you did a clear?  What was the command you used again?
[21:58] <ActionParsnip> m477: in the pastebin, scroll to the bottom and read
[21:59] <SonikkuAmerica> ztgu: So in other words it never wakes up after you press a key or move the mouse.
[21:59] <jhutchins_wk> ActionParsnip: There's no evidence of a storage device being connected.  That would preceed any encryption messages.
[21:59] <jhutchins_wk> m477: Was the device connected at boot?
[21:59] <m477> yes
[22:00] <memand> besame: why are you spamming?

[22:02] <ztgu> SonikkuAmerica: Why graphics card problem?
[22:03] <ActionParsnip> m477: the ide on the drive isn't reporting the drive make and model if it isn't picking up in BIOS

[22:05] <m477> in this situation
[22:05] <ActionParsnip> m477: drives fail, it happens
[22:05] <jhutchins_wk> m477: So is this an external drive with esata and usb connectors?
[22:06] <nimrod10> TheLordOfTime, ActionParsnip, both commands in  rc.local and /etc/init/local.conf create a file. So both must be working then ... Very strange that the other powertop related commands don't run ( appear to not run anyway )
[22:06] <ztgu> My system is able to resume from suspend only after I've let it hibernate.
[22:06] <ztgu> When I do a fresh boot and suspend the system just after the desktop started, resuming will result in a black screen and I had to power off the computer (see pm-suspend-kde-fail.log).
[22:06] <ztgu> When I do a fresh boot, hibernate the system just after the desktop started, resume, and do the suspend then, the system resumes without a problem (see pm-suspend-kde-success.log).
[22:06] <ztgu> Does somebody know what could be done by hibernate that is needed for a successful resume after suspend but is not done by suspend alone? How does hibernate affect my system?
[22:06] <m477> jhutchins_wk: no, I have external tray
[22:06] <FloodBot1> ztgu: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[22:07] <jhutchins_wk> m477: How sure are we that the drive has power?
[22:07] <m477> jhutchins_wk: I mean hdd tray, SATA -> USB
[22:07] <jhutchins_wk> Thing about ssds is they don't spin up.
[22:08] <m477> jhutchins_wk: I was plugging other SSD which was working
[22:09] <nimrod10> ztgu, what graphics card do you have on your system ?
[22:09] <jhutchins_wk> m477: I'm afraid that from what we can suggest in the way of troubleshooting, there's only one possible conclusion: dead drive.
[22:10] <ztgu> nimrod10: I have a radeon HD 7730M gpu, and an A10 cpu with integrated gpu,
[22:10] <nimrod10> ztgu, have you installed the proprietary ATI drivers ?
[22:12] <ztgu> nimrod10: I am using the opensource drivers, I control my video cards with vga_switcheroo to change and turn off cards.
[22:13] <nimrod10> ztgu, I was thingking it might be from the proprietary graphics drivers , but since you don't have those I can only direct you to look into /var/log/syslog and /var/log/X.0.log for more info

[22:39] <thalib> i dont know much about ubuntu or linux
[22:39] <thalib> so want to get started
[22:39] <kslater> does that even exist yet?
[22:39] <thalib> i have a vaio vpcf11j0e
[22:39] <chazword> I have a 10.04 system with 45 drives arranged in 5 RAIDs.  Often, the RAIDs (via mdadm) will try to initalize before all the drives have initialized.  Obviously this causes the RAIDs to fail.  Is there a way to force assembling RAIDs to be the absolutely last thing that the system does?  update-rc.d to 99 still has RAID assembly coming before framebuffer initialization.
[22:39] <thalib> i dont know which linux distribution to use as i am in uni also
[22:39] <kslater> seems like a decent amount of stuff needs to be in place unless it's just a fancy way to stream content from Amazon, etc.
[22:39] <thalib> should i use mint or ubuntu
[22:39] <jhutchins_wk> What?  Ubuntu is promoting vaporware?  I'm SHOCKED I tell you, just SHOCKED.
[22:40] <melkor> odd my internet seems to cut out for 30s every so often.
[22:40] <k1l> thalib: this is a ubuntu channel, so ubuntu
[22:40] <jhutchins_wk> k1l: Wifi?
[22:40] <k1l> jhutchins_wk: ?
[22:40] <kslater> thalib: mythbuntu
[22:40] <thalib> what is the difference between ubuntu and mint
[22:40] <thalib> what is mythbuntu
[22:41] <ActionParsnip> thalib: support for mint is separate to Ubuntu's
[22:41] <ActionParsnip> thalib: different default app set
[22:41] <melkor> thalib: mint is built on ubuntu and it has a bunch of artwork and packaging.
[22:41] <jhutchins_wk> thalib: Kinda like ford and chrysler.  More like if crysler bought it's parts from ford.
[22:42] <thalib> so if i want to play games or use word or excell like programs which one is better also for web surfing
[22:42] <melkor> Like Mazda and Ford light pick up trucks in the  90's.
[22:42] <melkor> The ford was a mazda rebranded.
[22:42] <jhutchins_wk> melkor: Yeah, except the parts aren't always the same.
[22:43] <melkor> thalib: get a live cd and try it out. The differences are aethetics.
[22:43] <anli_> Is there still a way of escaping unity and use gnome-session?
[22:43] <thalib> what is a live cd
[22:43] <jhutchins_wk> thalib: Also the support channels for Ubuntu are more active.
[22:43] <ActionParsnip> thalib: they are very similar, I recommend you try both
[22:44] <melkor> thalib: do you have a cd rom?
[22:44] <thalib> yes
[22:44] <melkor> !livecd
[22:44] <ubottu> The Ubuntu Desktop CD is a "LiveCD" which can be run without altering existing files on your harddrive. Especially useful for testing your hardware's compatibility, it also includes an install option.
[22:44] <k1l> thalib: again: you ask in a ubuntu channel so the best answer is ubuntu :)
[22:44] <xangua> !nounity | anli_
[22:44] <ubottu> anli_: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[22:45] <melkor> thalib: it is pretty easy to  d/load the iso and burn it to a bootable cd.
[22:45] <k1l> anli_: since unity is based on gnome3 and ubuntu ships the gnome-shell in their repos there is always a choice for gnome-shell
[22:45] <anli_> wow, the lag when I write something in my vbox installed ubuntu is terrible
[22:46] <thalib> ok cool i will try this tonight thanks guys u have helped me alot
[22:46] <anli_> Maybe I need to activate some graphics card acceleration?
[22:47] <k1l> anli_: on a vserver?
[22:47] <chazword> So, basically the question is how do I force an init script to be the ABSOLUTELY LAST thing that is run on boot.  updated-rc.d to 99 still has things coming after it.
[22:47] <anli_> k1l: virtualbox
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[22:47] <ActionParsnip> anli_: install xfce4 package in the virtual OS, log off and log in to the XFCE session, it'll be faster
[22:47] <k1l> anli_: the whole big dsktops dont run quick as a native install in the vbox.
[22:48] <k1l> anli_: but make sure to have the guest addidions installed
[22:48] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: rc.local should be the last thing init runs.
[22:48] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: Then again, it's not init any more.
[22:48] <anli_> Will the use of xfce4 something package intrude on my possibilities to use gnome-session?
[22:48] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: Why does it need to be last?
=== chiluk is now known as chiluk_away
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[22:49] <chazword> jhutchins_wk: It's 45 SATA drives initializing.  If it doesn't come last, then it tries to initialize the RAIDS before the drives are ready.
[22:49] <chazword> so /etc/init.d/mdadm-raid needs to be the last thing to run.  With it as 99, it boots mostly correctly one out of 50 times.  With mdadm-raid turned off and then manually started, it works fine everytime.
[22:50] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: So you have to make it dependent on the previous step.
[22:50] <k1l> anli_: xfce is another Desktop
[22:50] <ActionParsnip> anli_: you can simply select the session you want at login
[22:50] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: Possibly with a wait if you know the interval.
[22:50] <chazword> jhutchins_wk: I believe it is, but putting it into rc.local might be the way to go.
[22:51] <ActionParsnip> anli_: I alway s suggest XFCE or LXDE for virtualized OSes, they use fewer resources so are more responsive
[22:51] <anli_> xcfe is an alternative to gnome-session, I take it
[22:51] <chazword> There is no specific interval.  It's 5 RAID6s with 9 drives each.  Sometimes it comes up with 5 drives in each RAID, sometimes with 7, sometimes with just 5 drives in 1 RAID, and sometimes with 9 drives in all the RAIDs except for md0 which has 7.  If I manually start mdadm-raid after boot, everything is perfect
[22:51] <jhutchins_wk> anli_: A little deeper than that, but essentially.
[22:51] <ActionParsnip> anli_: its a desktop environment, it wil run instead of Gnome
[22:51] <ReKeToN-DeL_SuR> alguien español?
[22:51] <anli_> ok
[22:51] <ReKeToN-DeL_SuR> :)
[22:52] <k1l> anli_: vbox is not compareable to a native install. you have to think about that it is much slower. so you have to reduce the expectations on that
[22:52] <k1l> !es | ReKeToN-DeL_SuR
[22:52] <ubottu> ReKeToN-DeL_SuR: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[22:52] <anli_> hm, ok
[22:52] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: Right, so you figure out what starts the drives, you figure out how long they take to come up, and you invoke a delay between the first step and the second.
[22:52] <anli_> k1l: I like the low commitment of running virtually
[22:52] <ReKeToN-DeL_SuR> ubottu gracias amigo ;)
[22:52] <ubottu> ReKeToN-DeL_SuR: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[22:53] <k1l> anli_: think about using desktops for low hardware ressources like xfce or lxde
[22:53] <ReKeToN-DeL_SuR> ostias es un bot?
[22:53] <anli_> Maybe I just need a cooler 3d card
[22:53] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: I suspect that whatever starts the drives doesn't really know whether they're ready when it exits, so you have to either wait or have a way of testing.
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[22:53] <anli_> gnome-sessions with all extras turned off is also ok, I think
[22:53] <chazword> jhutchins_wk: Yeah, I'm putting it in rc.local with a wait 30 before it, I think that should do it, but I can always adjust the wait.
[22:54] <k1l> anli_: gnome-shell is still a 3d desktop that will use alot of power, though
[22:54] <chazword> jhutchins_wk: Thanks for your help.  I've done all the other UNIXs and Linuxs, but Ubuntu is the newer one for me.  The init setup in 10.04 seemed to be a few different systems working together rather than anything fully cohesive, so it was a bit odd.
[22:54] <anli_> well, true
[22:54] <chazword> Then again, this whole systme is a bit odd.  I recommend against backblaze hardware setups.
[22:54] <bampersand> Hey guys. I'm wanting to map CAPS to CTRL-BACKSPACE any idea how I could do this? I googled mapping but most posts are asking for key->key not a sequence
[22:55] <anli_> I will now try to enable the 3d acc and 2d acc in vbox
[22:55] <anli_> Maybe thats not a terribly bad idea
[22:56] <jhutchins_wk> chazword: upstart, which replaces init, attepmts to make startup faster by running many of the steps in parallel instead of sequentially.  To do this, it has to have better information about what each scripts depends on.

[22:59] <wabash> Hello, I'm looking at Ubuntu, from Fedora. I'd like to make the switch, but I have a few questions.
[22:59] <wabash> A) for the extra repositories (like the non-free, gstreamer codecs, that kind of stuff), does Ubuntu come with those set up? I.E., the keys and stuff all come with it?
[22:59] <anli_> Or why not fluxbox
[22:59] <wabash> B) How hard is it to take standard Ubuntu, and install KDE on it (if I decide I don't like unity)?
[23:02] <ActionParsnip> wabash: sure, just install ubuntu-restricted-extras and you are ready to rock
[23:02] <ActionParsnip> anli_: you could run just fluxbox, no desktop means the OS is lighter
[23:03] <anli_> trying ubuntu-restricted-extras then
[23:03] <mladoux> wabash: not too difficult.
=== Vampire0_ is now known as Vampire0
[23:04] <wabash> ActionParsnip: Is this 'ubuntu-restricted-extras' package available in the default repos? Are you saying that I can find it there, then install it, and then the additional repos will be available?

[23:04] <Dexx1_> I have XBMCbuntu installed but it now hangs at startup
[23:05] <Dexx1_> If it helps, details about the graphics card: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1511150
[23:05] <anli_> ubuntu-restricted-extras was nothing about the performance problems, right?
[23:05] <anli_> Just a cool set of packages
[23:06] <wabash> anli_: No I think that was for me. I was wondering about codecs and such.
[23:06] <anli_> gdm or lightdm?
[23:06] <anli_> aha!
[23:06] <anli_> I installed it as well
[23:06] <anli_> lol :)
[23:06] <anli_> lightdm seems to be lighter
[23:07] <kslater> what the heck is jdb2 and why is it such an IO pig?
[23:07] <anli_> Maybe I should always use a lighter ubuntu version when I run in a vbox, like kubuntu or something

[23:09] <wabash> ActionParsnip: Nice thank you!
[23:09] <wabash> ActionParsnip: I'd like to clarify...
[23:10] <wabash> ActionParsnip: default repos are all ubuntu/free. Then to access the other repo, I install a package from default repo,a nd that package sets up the non-free repo?
[23:10] <bobrik> hi sll
[23:10] <bobrik> all
[23:10] <anli_> wow, when I logout, the xserver is killed
[23:11] <ActionParsnip> wabash: free as in beer, yes. Some stuff (like the restricted extras) have non-free (as in speech) packages
[23:11] <kslater> I wonder if this high amount of io by jbd2 is related to having installed zfs as a kernel module
[23:11] <wabash> ActionParsnip: Yes, without mincing hairs.... :) I just meant in terms of setting that up. Compared to Fedora, which is a PITA
[23:12] <ActionParsnip> wabash: Ubuntu is made for newcomers to Ubuntu, so there is a LOT of hand holding
