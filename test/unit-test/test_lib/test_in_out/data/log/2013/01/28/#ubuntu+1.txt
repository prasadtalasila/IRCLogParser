[00:07] <Bluefoxicy> Hmm micah says "If we upload 3.0.2 to experimental would that be useful for Ubuntu?"
[00:08] <Bluefoxicy> TheLordOfTime: You here?
[00:08] <TheLordOfTime> Bluefoxicy, slightly distracted migrating 10GB of databases from MSSQL -> MySQL
[00:08] <TheLordOfTime> sup?
[00:09] <Bluefoxicy> Debian is still carrying an old Puppet in Sid because they're frozen for Lenny, but they have a newer 3.0 package in git and they have raised that they can upload newer packages to experimental without causing trouble with the feature freeze at Debian
[00:09] <Bluefoxicy> is any of this helpful to Ubuntu for pulling newer packages?  ubuntu seems to inheret the package from Sid, which is well out of date.
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> no offense for this really-evil statement, but why should I care?
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> ah
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> lag.
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> um...
[00:10] <Bluefoxicy> (in fact, was out of date when 12.10 was released, but 12.10 was in feature freeze)
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> last i checked...
[00:10] <Bluefoxicy> asking about general release cycle, inheritence from Debian, and politics :)
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> hmm...
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> !info puppet raring
[00:10] <ubottu> puppet (source: puppet): Centralized configuration management - agent startup and compatibility scripts. In component main, is optional. Version 2.7.18-1ubuntu1 (raring), package size 20 kB, installed size 110 kB
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> if it were in universe i'd say ask the MOTUs, i usually deal with universe thingies
[00:10] <TheLordOfTime> note: i'm not dev nor motu
[00:11] <Bluefoxicy> ah
[00:11] <Bluefoxicy> I thought you might know, nobody else seems to be around.
[00:11] <TheLordOfTime> well...
[00:11] <Bluefoxicy> and I am entirely peripheral and have no idea what I'm doing :D
[00:11] <TheLordOfTime> i know for UNIVERSE, you have to explicitly request a sync from Experimental
[00:11] <Bluefoxicy> I'm just trying to make other people do what I want :D
[00:11] <TheLordOfTime> but i dunno if that applies to main as well
[00:11] <TheLordOfTime> devs would know
[00:11] <Bluefoxicy> nod.  I'll find out elsewhere then.
[00:12] <TheLordOfTime> yeah sorry i can't be of more help
[00:12] <Bluefoxicy> np
[00:12] <Bluefoxicy> I was just trying for a fast answer anyway
[00:12]  * TheLordOfTime checks something
[00:13] <TheLordOfTime> Bluefoxicy, erm...
[00:13] <TheLordOfTime> if it were my call i'd say reject a sync request... its an RC that's in experimental: http://packages.debian.org/source/experimental/puppet
[00:13] <TheLordOfTime> but again i'm not MOTU, Dev, RElease Team, or otherwise
[00:13]  * TheLordOfTime has no say in the matter
[00:13] <TheLordOfTime> but i tend to err on the side of caution so... :P
[00:14] <Bluefoxicy> TheLordOfTime: no, there's an RC in experimental
[00:14] <TheLordOfTime> that's what i said?
[00:14] <Bluefoxicy> but they're asking if pulling 3.0.2 into Debian experimental would help
[00:14] <TheLordOfTime> who's asking where?
[00:14] <Bluefoxicy> since I want 3.0.2 in Ubuntu, but Debian Sid carries 2.7.18, and Ubuntu typically syncs from Debian
[00:15] <TheLordOfTime> who's asking where about putting 3.0.2 from git to experimental?
[00:16] <Bluefoxicy> Who's asking => I actually pinged the debian devel list asking about getting Puppet 3.0.2 into Debian because they had 2.7.18 and I want Puppet 3 in Raring
[00:16] <Bluefoxicy> Getting 3.0.2 into Raring by telling the Ubuntu devs "there are packages in the Puppetlabs repo go get them" doesn't seem like a great strategy
[00:17] <TheLordOfTime> Bluefoxicy, i'd suggest that you start by getting them to put it into Experimental
[00:17] <TheLordOfTime> first.
[00:17] <Bluefoxicy> nod.
[00:17] <TheLordOfTime> before asking to see if it can get into Ubuntu Raring
[00:17] <TheLordOfTime> ... Y U SO EVIL MSSQLDB!
[00:17]  * TheLordOfTime goes to beat the migration software with a stick
[00:17] <Bluefoxicy> That <Bluefoxicy> Hmm micah says "If we upload 3.0.2 to experimental would that be useful for Ubuntu?"
[00:17] <Bluefoxicy> was the question
[00:17] <Bluefoxicy> lol
[00:17] <Bluefoxicy> TheLordOfTime:  I hear that everyone may be abandoning MySQL soon.
[00:18] <Bluefoxicy> Fedora might throw it out in 2013.  It's been proposed with no objections.
[00:18] <Bluefoxicy> SuSE is considering it, but currently in feature freeze.  Next version of OpenSuSE.
[00:18] <Bluefoxicy> Debian as well, but nothing's come of it--feature freeze.
[00:18] <TheLordOfTime> you should read your privmsgs
[00:18] <TheLordOfTime> and stop beating a dead horse from yesterday
[00:18] <Bluefoxicy> Forgot I said that yesterday
[00:22] <TheLordOfTime> you did
[00:22] <TheLordOfTime> i think it was in -devel or somewhere
[00:22]  * TheLordOfTime doesn't have logs though
[00:22]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[00:47] <micahg> Ubuntu has been discussing that for a few cycles now, the biggest problem seems to be a clean migration path
[00:47] <micahg> well, that and the lack of a clear replacement
[00:47] <micahg> (excluding postgres :))
[00:48] <Bluefoxicy> the discussion seems to be mainly aimed at MariaDB, which is just a mysql fork
[00:48] <Bluefoxicy> I've been using percona but they share source code
[00:48] <Bluefoxicy> MariaDB now has XtraDB from Percona for example.  Percona doesn't yet have Maria Aria
[00:49] <micahg> precona, drizzle, mariadb, there's no clear leader...that's contributing to the stagnation of everyone else remaining on MySQL
[00:49] <Bluefoxicy> ah
[00:49] <Bluefoxicy> it's more of an issue of too many choices then :)
[00:50] <Bluefoxicy> Fedora seems to have decided on MariaDB, so has SuSE.  My guess is that MariaDB being an open source project (like postgresql) and Percona being a product (like MySQL under MySQL AB and Oracle) is making MariaDB more attractive.
[00:51] <Bluefoxicy> Debian has discussed it a few times but it goes nowhere.  Methinks they are too busy in feature freeze to bother with that.
[00:52] <Bluefoxicy> In any case it's happening and I'm trying to figure out when and which way.  The problem is none of the actors seem to know at this point :|
=== Jikan is now known as Jikai
=== Jikai is now known as Jikan
[05:01] <gnomefreak> anyone notice in Gnome3/Unity there is no working screensavers. It seems with the introduction with Gnome3 and Unity we lost a lot of things we can no longer customize a lot of things
[05:03] <gnomefreak> i thought one of linux gimmick was tha tyou can customize it to your liking
[05:49] <micahg> gnomefreak: I thought that gdm/lightdm were supposed to take over that function, I also thought that wasn't planned until GNOME 3.8
[05:51] <bjsnider> screensavers are meaningless these days, so why maintain code that is meaningless
[05:55] <micahg> bjsnider: it's the screen lock component that I believe he's asking about (please correct if I'm wrong)
[05:56] <bjsnider> i thought he was talking about screensavers
[05:56] <bjsnider> he's been complaining about them for a couple of days
[05:56] <bjsnider> as in wanting a screensaver
[05:57] <micahg> he said screensaver, I interpreted lock, but that could just be my tiredness :)
[05:57] <bjsnider> lock works in gnome 3.6 i think
[05:57] <bjsnider> i have a lock option here
[05:58] <micahg> ah, well, in that case, I'd suggest XScreensaver :)
[05:58] <bjsnider> i'm using gdm/gnome-shell
[06:00] <bjsnider> micahg, can that still be shoehorned in? is that codebase still getting upstream work?
[06:03] <gnomefreak> micahg: i havent found a way to do it yet.there isnt a dialog for screensavers, hell there are only likr 4 themes you can choose from
[06:03] <jbicha> bjsnider: xscreensaver is still maintained, it's just fighting with gnome that you'd have to worry about
[06:03] <bjsnider> gnomefreak, you did want a screensaver and not screen lock right?
[06:03] <gnomefreak> i have no way to set a screensaver. there is no dialog(has nothing to do with lock that i can tell
[06:04] <gnomefreak> correct
[06:04] <bjsnider> yeah but he wondered if you were asking exclusively about the lock feature and it sounds to me like you want a screensaver
[06:05] <gnomefreak> i want a screensaver i hate not having one
[06:05] <gnomefreak> and it has been closer to 6 moths or so (complining)
[06:06] <bjsnider> jbicha, i can't get gnome-settings-daemon to run right on this system. is there a problem with it in gnome 3.6 that you know about?
[06:06] <bjsnider> i've got the one from the ppa if it has the latest
[06:07] <micahg> we're also 5 versions behind for xscreensaver
[06:07] <gnomefreak> it just seems to me that gnome doesnt want us to have a way to customize, that defeats some of the reason is so great is that you can change things were as winblows allows you to change some things
[06:07] <micahg> gnomefreak: http://www.jwz.org/blog/2011/10/has-gnome-3-decided-that-people-shouldnt-want-screen-savers/
[06:07] <gnomefreak> we are on gnome 3.6 already?
[06:08] <gnomefreak> micahg: thanks
[06:08] <bjsnider> 3.8 is coming up. development is at 3.7
[06:10] <jbicha> bjsnider: which ppa?
[06:10] <bjsnider> gnome 3
[06:11] <jbicha> as long as you're not using the gnome3-staging ppa, g-s-d 3.6 should be working
[06:11] <bjsnider> but really, it's been a problem since october. it often fails to start at boot time
[06:12] <gnomefreak> is it saying that xscreensaver will work?
[06:13] <bjsnider> right now, alt+f2 does't work and gvfs-monitor-dir also doesn't work
[06:15] <bjsnider> gnomefreak, i don't think screensavers are ever coming back
[06:17] <micahg> your best shot is probably xscreensaver
[06:18] <micahg> but depending on how hard GNOME makes integration, it might not work
[06:20] <bjsnider> or he could write his own screensaver app from scratch
[06:20] <micahg> I tend to not encourage NIH thinking
[06:21] <micahg> Xubuntu uses Xscreensaver
[06:23] <bjsnider> i wonder if the latest source code would be easier to integrate than the one that's 5 versions out of date
[06:24] <micahg> yeah, 5.20 is in the Debian git repo, I guess the maintainer is waiting for wheezy to release
[06:24]  * micahg will see about getting that in raring
[06:28] <gnomefreak> wheezy is debian experimental or beta?
[06:30] <gnomefreak> micahg: your up late
[06:37] <bjsnider> wheezy is testing
[06:37] <bjsnider> not experimental or unstable per se
[06:39] <gnomefreak> oh ok
[06:39] <gnomefreak> did Debian ever bring over Unity?

[10:11] <sbivol> Hi, I have a strange issue on Kubuntu Raring - opening a magnet link renders the desktop unusable, with Xorg eating 100% CPU (sorry for cross-posting)
[13:43] <BluesKaj> Hi folks
[14:56] <MrChrisDruif> Hi BluesKaj
[14:56] <BluesKaj> Hey MrChrisDruif
[14:57] <MrChrisDruif> How's it going BluesKaj ?
[14:58] <MrChrisDruif> Ugh, too many people with nicks starting with bl...
[14:58] <BluesKaj> just fine thanks , MrChrisDruif , and how'ew you doing ?
[14:59] <MrChrisDruif> Pretty good actually. Today wasn't as active as the last couple of days (we're on snow sport vacation in Germany)
[15:06] <BluesKaj> MrChrisDruif, skiing ? ..I miss it , but my knees won't let me ski anymore :(
[15:09] <MrChrisDruif> Damn, that's awful. But snowboarding actually for me =)
[15:13] <BluesKaj> by the time 'boarding caught on my skiing days were already history ..it's been 25 yrs , and i'm too old to start over anyway
[15:14] <MrChrisDruif> Hmm, you're a lot older then I imagined ^_^
[15:16] <BluesKaj> yup , been retired for 14 yrs
[15:20] <MrChrisDruif> Now you've made me really curious about your age O.o
[15:28] <BluesKaj> I'm 69
[15:31] <BluesKaj> what's the gnome /unity equivalent to system settings>startup&shutdown on KDE ?
[15:32] <MrChrisDruif> Startup and shutdown? If you tell me what it does precisely I might be able to tell you.
[15:33] <BluesKaj> one can add scripts  and apps  to start apps/daemons  at startup , like dropbox  for example
[15:35] <BluesKaj> one has to add a script dropboxd to startup and shutdown to load the app and daemon sometime in the boot process
[15:35] <BluesKaj> on kde
[15:36] <BluesKaj> there's a guy in #ubuntu who's dropbox daemon just keeps dying
[15:36] <BluesKaj> I haven't run gnome/unity in along time
[15:42] <BluesKaj> maybe I should add the ubuntu-desktop as an option , but i don't need all the gtk apps which will dupe what I already have
[15:43] <BluesKaj> or just stop trying to help on #ubuntu ...it' s becoming more difficult since unity was introduced
[15:43] <MrChrisDruif> I should know this.
[15:44] <MrChrisDruif> In Gnome it's Alt+F2 then gnome-session-properties
[15:44] <MrChrisDruif> Not sure for Unity (haven't run THAT in about a year already)
=== jack is now known as wN
[15:44] <BluesKaj> thanks , MrChrisDruif
[15:44] <MrChrisDruif> No prob.
[15:58] <BluesKaj> MrChrisDruif, it's not biggie , just an icon that's acting up , dropbox seens to work ok for him
[15:58] <MrChrisDruif> Good to hear =)
[15:59] <BluesKaj> dropbox on kde is a little trickier , but it's solid once installed
[16:02] <MrChrisDruif> Dropbox is super simple on gnome
[16:02] <MrChrisDruif> Fedora or Ubuntu, both are just a few clicks away from installing.
[16:04] <BluesKaj> on kde , one has to add the daemon to the startup sequence , which the install procedure doesn't do for some reason
[16:08] <BluesKaj> the install procedure is quite simple now , just that one little step that hasn't been written
[16:11] <Walther> Hi again! It seems compiz doesn't function anymore as intended - i lost my virtual desktops
[16:12] <Walther> Anyone else with this issue?
[16:14] <Walther> Also, it seems like I have subpixel smoothing wrong or something if I run compiz --replace &
[17:27] <FernandoMiguel> where did the multi desktop go?
[17:27] <FernandoMiguel> I seem to only have one now :S
[17:28] <FernandoMiguel> some how, I've been reduced to 1x1 instead of the stock 2x2 :S
[17:37] <jbicha> FernandoMiguel: System Settings>Appearance>Behavior
[17:38] <jbicha> stock *is* 1x1 now
[17:38] <FernandoMiguel> jbicha:  went with compiz :)
[17:38] <FernandoMiguel> oh is it?
[17:38] <FernandoMiguel> what's the rational for the change?
[17:38] <jbicha> bug 868423, it's too confusing for people not expecting it and it's really a power user feature
[17:38] <ubottu> bug 868423 in unity (Ubuntu) "Launcher - Workspace switcher should not be in the Launcher by default" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/868423
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> LOLOLOL
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> oh come on....
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> even windows 7 has 2 desktops
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> OSx had them for ever
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> and every mobile OS has them
[17:39] <jbicha> windows 7 does not
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> it has two
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> click on the bottom corner
[17:40] <jbicha> that's just "show desktop"
[17:40] <FernandoMiguel> from the little use I gave it , it allowed me to have two set of apps open and switch between them
[17:40] <jbicha> android doesn't have workspaces, it has all apps fullscreen with the ability to switch between them
[17:41] <FernandoMiguel> true
[17:41] <FernandoMiguel> still....
[17:41] <FernandoMiguel> confusing? :S
[17:41] <jbicha> at least they made an easy button to turn workspaces back on
[17:42] <jbicha> it's confusing if you accidently click the workspace switcher (or even worse, accidently hit the key combination that makes all your apps disappear)
[17:43] <FernandoMiguel> jbicha: they did? even with your instructions, I can't find it :S
[17:43] <jbicha> personally I don't use workspaces as the cost/benefit ratio is too high for me so far ;)
[17:43] <FernandoMiguel> at work, I had two LCDs and 4 workspaces. all full
[17:44] <FernandoMiguel> AFAIK clicking on the launcher bar will make you jump to the workspace that has the app open
[17:44] <FernandoMiguel> unless it's chrome and the window is minimized... in that case good luck getting it back
[17:44] <jbicha> FernandoMiguel: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/ubuntu-13-04-adds-new-launcher-options
[17:44] <FernandoMiguel> I should file that bug too :|
[17:44] <jbicha> Unity has too much junk in the launcher by default, I'm glad that there's one less item there
[17:45] <FernandoMiguel> I don't have the apperance menu :\
[17:46] <jbicha> FernandoMiguel: install gnome-control-center-unity
[17:47] <jbicha> that's new for raring
[17:47] <FernandoMiguel> shouldn't ubuntu-desktop metapackage pull that?
[17:49] <jbicha> FernandoMiguel: unity recommends it
[17:49] <FernandoMiguel> what's the *proper* way to drag icons on the launcher?
[17:49] <FernandoMiguel> I seem to be able to do it sometimes
[17:49] <FernandoMiguel> $ apt-cache policy unity
[17:49] <FernandoMiguel>   Installed: 6.12.0daily13.01.25.1-0ubuntu1
[18:54] <FunnyLookinHat> Is anyone else experiencing an issue with Middleclick + Alt + Drag to resize windows?  Mine doesn't seem to grab the right window for focus about 1/2 the time... but I also got a new mouse so I'm not sure if the issues are related.
