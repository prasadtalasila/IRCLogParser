[00:01] <SonikkuAmerica__> Quick one: Can I get to the 13.04 beta using [ update-manager -c -d ] yet in 12.10?
[00:02] <rajke88> did anyone tried new ati drivers on Ubuntu 12.10?
[00:02] <bean> dpurgert: it is, but linux doesn't use it.

[00:02] <bean> anthony__: what did it display
[00:02] <SonikkuAmerica__> jrib: Didn't know there was a channel for it... lol
[00:02] <dpurgert> bean, ah ... that explains it
[00:02] <SonikkuAmerica__> I typically like getting my hands on raw stuff
[00:02] <anthony__> it said the connection timed out. no server could be reached

[00:05] <anthony__> m not sure. how would i check

[00:22] <ActionParsnip> anthony__: ^
[00:23] <slacktivist> i'm downloading ubuntu server 12.04 at 20kbps.  Is this a ploy to make me buy the CDs?
[00:23] <bean> anthony__: what made you decide on on 11.10
[00:23] <anthony__> do u meanwhat
[00:23] <ActionParsnip> slacktivist: tried a different source?
[00:23] <bean> anthony__: current ubuntu is 12.04 for LTS and 12.10 for non-lts
[00:23] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, wha? I didn't break anything ... at least I don't think so ...
[00:24] <ActionParsnip> dpurgert: just an fyi :)
[00:24] <anthony__> because it worked the best out of all the verions i had
[00:24] <edward-san> hmm, I forgot about the gcc-snapshot package... I don't need to go unsecure
[00:24] <west333> anthony__ you could try  sudo lshw -c network  that should bring up all of the network info,  then get the chipset name and the driver name
[00:24] <slacktivist> ActionParsnip, there is no other source listed on the download page.
[00:24] <ultreia> anthony__ > you mentioned your xbox working fine. does your dsl modem (or dsl modem) have more than one place to plug in an ethernet cable, or are you just using one single modem/router plug for various things?
[00:24] <ActionParsnip> slacktivist: you can use cdimage site
[00:24] <ActionParsnip> slacktivist: torrents will run a lot faster
[00:24] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, I know this ... the argument was "Ubuntu (or linux ...?) doesn't use it"
[00:25] <slacktivist> ?cdimage? ActionParsnip ?
[00:25] <ActionParsnip> slacktivist: yes
[00:25] <bianca> what do i do if im installing something in the software manager and it gets stuck half way, it says applying changes
[00:25] <histo> slacktivist: cdimage.ubuntu.com
[00:25] <slacktivist> thanks histo and ActionParsnip
[00:25] <anthony__> it has multiple ports
[00:26] <ActionParsnip> slacktivist: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=cdimage+ubuntu   too hard?
[00:26] <ultreia> anthony__ > ok, so it's probably a router and not just a modem
[00:27] <slacktivist> ActionParsnip, that would really help if there were actually torrents for 12.04

[00:27] <ultreia> anthony__ > next question. if you attach your 11.10 pc and boot, what exactly does "ifconfig" say?

[00:32] <bean> oh jeez, bianca: never stop it when its in the middle of things
[00:32] <ActionParsnip> bianca: what are you installing?
[00:32] <bianca> playonlinux..
[00:32] <anthony__> it has eth0 and lo with things after each
[00:32] <ultreia> anthony__ > under the "eth0" section, does it list anything resembling an ip address?

[00:32] <ubottu> bianca: If an APT front-end crashed and your database is locked, try this in a !terminal: « sudo fuser -vki /var/lib/dpkg/lock;sudo dpkg --configure -a »

[00:33] <bianca> do i cllose the software center first?
[00:33] <ultreia> anthony__ > I mean, are there any sets of 4 numbers separated by dots?
[00:34] <ActionParsnip> bianca: yes
[00:34] <bianca> um.. it worked except i went and tryed to remove playonlinux again and now its stuck again lol
[00:35] <jhutchins> ultreia: We established over an hour ago that he didn't have an ipv4 on eth0, he tried dhclient and it timed out, we've never confirmed he has an actual connection by looking at the link lights.

[00:36] <anthony__> no just one with a mix of letters and numbers separated by colons. im starting to think it was a bad install of the os. cause my usb wont even mount
[00:36] <bianca> dpkg: error: --configure --pending does not take any non-option arguments

[00:37] <ultreia> anthony__ > does your modem/router have any brand/model number on it?
[00:37] <jhutchins> ultreia: Why would that matter?
[00:37] <kunaishuriken> Hello everyone.
[00:38] <jhutchins> ultreia: He either doesn't have a physical connection - bad cable or not seated - or there's a problem with the driver.  Since he won't answer simple direct questions I think we're just wasting channel bandwidth.
[00:38] <anthony__> my routervis a westell 7500
[00:38] <kunaishuriken> Does anyone know how to multiseat with tty, but NOT X?
[00:39] <ultreia> jhutchins- I am thinking that anthony's dsl box might have multiple ports but still be just a dsl modem, in which case his isp might be filtering connections based on mac address, with his xbox being the currently accepted mac address
[00:39] <anthony__> bean: i tried those. they didnt work well with my computer. thats y i came back to 11.10

[00:44] <djshotglass> yes didnt error but didnt turn on monitor either
[00:44] <bean> bianca: what is going on now
[00:44] <bianca> its still stuck
[00:44] <ultreia> anthony__ > was your xbox already up and running and connected to your dsl modem when you booted ubuntu?
[00:44] <bianca> it wont install..

[00:44] <bean> bianca: are you attempting to install via apt / aptitude or synaptic
[00:45] <anthony__> h comtuer connected fine before i put 11.10 on it. my tablet connects fine too. my router has 4 etho out. and  1 dsl in

[00:45] <bianca> the ubuntu software center
[00:46] <ultreia> anthony__ > that wasn't the question. What exactly was running and connected to the dsl modem when you boot up your ubuntu pc?
[00:46] <escott> djshotglass, if you are going to be playing around with display :0 from the tty you probably want to export the DISPLAY variable
[00:47] <anthony__> y xbox wasnton but it was connectwd. it cant be the HW of the computer cause it connected to the internet with12.10
[00:47] <anthony__> the computer
[00:47] <bianca> -_-
[00:48] <bean> bianca: then you could stop software center, and do the !aptfix from earlier
[00:48] <ultreia> anthony__ > the point I'm trying to make is that the first machine you boot after you power up your dsl modem, wins and gets the ip address. everything else loses and gets nothing
[00:48] <bianca> oh it finally worked! i guess im just impatient
[00:48] <bean> bianca: andthen use apt-get install packagename
[00:51] <anthony__> then y did everything work fine before. i was using my compute,  tablet and xbox all at the same time. my computer wont connect to the network at all. not just the internet. the router itself
[00:51] <Annette01> Hey guys, im a little stuck here, i just installed ubuntu but my computer just boots to windows without getting to a bootloader or anything
[00:52] <bean> bianca: like i said, nothing is instant
[00:52] <ultreia> anthony__ > ok. maybe your ethernet card is fried, and it concidentally happened at exactly the same time as when you reinstalled 11.10
[00:53] <ultreia> anthony__ > or maybe one of the little wires in the ethernet cable chose that moment to break
[00:53] <anthony__> would it stilll show up in terminal after a sudo command if it was fried?
[00:54] <ultreia> anthony__ > the only way to be sure it's not hardware is to reinstall 12.x, at least for a little while
[00:54] <anthony__> i tried 2 etho coords
[00:54] <ultreia> anthony__ > at least boot the live cd
[00:54] <e2580> hi, anyone know a rule based way i can control my media player, example, if id tag for artist contains "justin bieber", then skip next track? Im using clementine for a media player, i may be open to other players that support this but i prefer a generic approach.
[00:55] <ultreia> anthony__ > if you boot the 12.x live cd and it's working, then you know the problem isn't HW

[00:56] <arch> what do you need help with, m'lady?

[01:03] <compdoc> thetinyjesus, good support. many packages available.
[01:03] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: personal preference i would say, ubuntu has the larger community
[01:03] <thetinyjesus> Anyone?
[01:04] <anthony__> i no what ur thinkin. im doin it now
[01:04] <elky> arch stop that
[01:04] <thetinyjesus> oops sorry didnt see chat
[01:04] <thetinyjesus> is there things that are compatible with ubuntu that are not with linux mint?
[01:04] <arch> elky
[01:04] <arch> stupid nooboontus
[01:04] <arch> noobuntu
[01:04] <elky> thetinyjesus, ubuntu users get to get support from this large community. mint users have to try find someone in their small community.
[01:04] <ultreia> anthony__ > if you have nothing to lose on the entire drive, no windows at all, there is a command "dd" which should be used before reinstalling ubuntu
[01:05] <thetinyjesus> elky: is it because the two are not compatible with each other?
[01:05] <bean> ultreia: not really...
[01:05] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: they are not supported here
[01:05] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: so if you are facing issues with mint you have to use other support ressources
[01:05] <bean> !derivatives | thetinyjesus
[01:05] <ubottu> thetinyjesus: There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mint), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)
[01:05] <anthony__> so go into terminal and put in dd?
[01:05] <elky> thetinyjesus, no, but we ubuntu users don't know all the mint changes, so we can't give support for it
[01:05] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: but normally they are compatible
[01:06] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: i would suggest to try out ubuntu
[01:06] <bean> anthony__: no, i would just reinstall, and just be sure to tell it to use the whole disk, not "replace" just use entire disk
[01:06] <elky> thetinyjesus, the same way redhat won't support centos
[01:06] <thetinyjesus> iceroot: the problem I had with ubuntu is i really disliked unity after using it for a couple weeks, and really enjoyed cinnamon otherwise i'd just use ubuntu
[01:06] <ultreia> anthony__ > what you would do is boot the flash drive, and enter the "dd" command from it's console, before installing
[01:06] <bean> ultreia: why, there's no point
[01:07] <bean> ultreia: the disk is going to get formatted anyways
[01:07] <ultreia> bean- it will by default get a quick format which doesn't erase any of the garbage already there
[01:08] <bean> ultreia: i question whether you know what you're talking about there.
[01:08] <anthony__> ok.dovi hit"try ubuntu"? how do i get to the console
[01:08] <thetinyjesus> as far as stability goes, are they equals to each other, as in ubuntu releases an update will linux mint receive the same update or does mint specifically go through the updates and choose which ones they want to add
[01:08] <ultreia> anthony__ > ask bean
[01:08] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: you should ask the mint channel how they handle updates
[01:08] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: mint is not supported here
[01:09] <iceroot> !mint | thetinyjesus
[01:09] <ubottu> thetinyjesus: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[01:09] <bean> anthony__: just go to "install ubuntu"
[01:09] <elky> thetinyjesus, the bits you touch will be mint changes and they can't just get those from ubuntu developers. you'd have to wait for mint to fix the problems
[01:09] <thetinyjesus> iceroot: alright, last question is ubuntu 12.04 more stable and smoother running than 12.10? i know its a long term release but are there features in 12.10 that make it run better
[01:09] <bean> anthony__: and from there go through stuff until you get to "Installation type", from there do the "Erase Disk and install ubuntu" option
[01:10] <bean> better is a very relative term, thetinyjesus
[01:11] <thetinyjesus> bean: better to me would be smoother running, faster response, i don't care about having to reinstall sooner than LT editions
[01:11] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: i would say 12.04 is more stable then 12.10
[01:11] <thetinyjesus> bean: also more universal compatible I say this because for example on Steam's website they say to download 12.04 not 12.10
[01:12] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: its tested for a longer time, its using better tested software (older)
[01:12] <ultreia> thetinyjesus, if Steam is important to you, that would be major consideration
[01:12] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: steam is working fine here on 12.04 but the games are running better on 12.10 because 12.10 comes with a newer xorg-intel package
[01:13] <anthony__> ok imdoing it nowok
[01:13] <thetinyjesus> iceroot: is it true that you should never upgrade your linux distribution only fresh install, also as far as older software goes would that mean when firefox / google chrome release updates 12.04 will not get for a longer period of time
[01:13] <ultreia> thetinyjesus- upgrade are like rolling dice
[01:13] <bean> thetinyjesus: you can upgrade ubuntu installations. I know that Mint recommends a clean install
[01:14] <bean> Yeah, I don't really /like/ doing upgrades to be honest.
[01:14] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: upgrades are working ok, no need for fresh installed
[01:14] <bean> A bit scary...
[01:14] <bean> I actually tried a 10.04 -> 12.04 a while back
[01:14] <bean> on a vm
[01:14] <bean> didn't end well
[01:14] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: normally a program will never get a major update just a security update but there are a few exceptions like browsers, mailclients (thunderbird), libreoffice and so on
[01:14] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: but the base-system will not hit major-updates within one ubuntu release
[01:15] <thetinyjesus> bean: so technically with ubuntu i could install 12.10, and when a beta of 13.04 comes out i could "upgrade" to that and as new betas come out it will be a rolling update so once 13.04 was fully released I would already have all the files?
[01:15] <ultreia> thetinyjesus- does Steam only recommend buntu?
[01:15] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: yes
[01:15] <iceroot> ultreia: yes
[01:15] <bean> thetinyjesus: i suppose you could, yes.
[01:16] <bean> thetinyjesus: keep in mind that 13.04 is only supported in #ubuntu+1 though
[01:16] <thetinyjesus> iceroot: so ubuntu 12.04 would use older versions of firefox etc, 12.10 would use a newer version but i would have to manually install the newest version of those programs ?
[01:16] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: no
[01:16] <thetinyjesus> bean: as in if i had issues i would use a different IRC channel ?
[01:16] <anthony__> i tried booting from te flash but it did the hdd first instead. i have the boot sequence as removables first.ill take the hdd off thensequence all together and se wheere thst gets me
[01:16] <iceroot> thetinyjesus: programs like browsers (as i said) will hit major updates within one ubuntu release
[01:16] <thetinyjesus> iceroot: oh my bad dude

[01:20] <ultreia> thetinyjesus- what happened wrong with mint?
[01:21] <thetinyjesus> ultreia: i installed some themes that automatically installed and corrupted something because it's running rubbish now

[01:22] <tats> hi, i was running ubuntu precise 12.04 (running unity as my windows manager) and I just did an upgrade to 12.10. at login my GUI is basically gone: I only see the background. no widget, no menu, nothing.
[01:23] <ultreia> upgrades are like a (russian) roulette wheel
[01:23] <tats> ultreia: I don't know: i always get the bullet.
[01:25] <crazycory22> HELP!
[01:25] <ultreia> tats- the bad news is you can't downgrade back to 12.04
[01:25] <tats> great
[01:25] <crazycory22> can someone help me please?
[01:26] <escott> crazycory22, only if you ask
[01:26] <ultreia> crazycory22- what seems to be the problem?
[01:27] <crazycory22> I'm new to Ubuntu.  I ran Ubuntu 11.10 for a couple of weeks, and had my computer auto update to Ubuntu 12.04.  My dell 1395 wifi card WAS working in 11.10, in 12.04 i go to install the STA drivers and I get this error message in the log

[01:29] <bairui> ok; assuming there are no PPAs for python-pygments version 1.5 for Precise, what is the recommended way to install this version on Precise?
[01:29] <crazycory22> on the CLI this is what it said "# Replaced by b43 and ssb.
[01:30] <crazycory22> it has "b43" in red
[01:30] <escott> crazycory22, thats a comment
[01:30] <bean> bairui: why not use 1.6?
[01:30] <linuxgecko> crazycory22:    I'm here..   i have a solution to help.
[01:30] <bairui> 1.6 would be fine - is it available for Precise?
[01:30] <escott> crazycory22, try grep -C5 b43 /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

[01:33] <ubottu> For information on setting up encrypted private directories (8.10+) see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedPrivateDirectory

[01:34] <toter> Hi… Does anyone know how to remove these annoying bluetooth messages from startup? http://pastebin.com/FN1wFkLD
[01:34] <toter> I tried almost everything
[01:35] <hotfungi> cls, Ben64 , escott , thank you all
[01:35] <Ben64> toter: some lines in a log affect you?
[01:35] <ultreia> tats- fixing a corrupted upgrade is beyond my skills
[01:35] <tats> ultreia: i know but i want to make sure that every package was properly installed during the upgrade. there was an interruption (my computer froze) during the upgrade process so i'd like to make sure the packages were installed before looking into other things.
[01:36] <Lucenut> hotfungi, I think in xubuntu it;s an option in the installer.
[01:36] <tats> ultreia: beyond mine as well ... :/
[01:36] <toter> Ben64: So i have to disable rsyslog then?
[01:36] <anthony__> im just havin a shit day with technology
[01:36] <hotfungi> Lucenut, that'd be awesome- I'll look into it, thanks
[01:37] <Ben64> tats: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[01:37] <ultreia> tats- for whether the packages installed ok, try the file "/var/log/dpkg.log" and see if it has any errors near the end
[01:37] <appamatto> Why aren't there any USB memstick images?
[01:37] <Ben64> toter: i'm trying to figure out why you care, it doesn't affect performance or anything
[01:37] <hotfungi> Lucenut, looks like it's an option on standard Ubuntu 12.10 installs too?
[01:37] <cls> appamatto just download the normal ISO and make it a bootable cd ?
[01:38] <cls> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
[01:40] <Bacon3> www.niggertube.com || YOU ARE ALL FAGGOTS
[01:41] <BroUnicorn> o.o
[01:41] <tats> Ben64: installing ubuntu-desktop solved part of the issue: i now can see my desktop. still no menus though. i'll try deleting my .gnome and .compiz folders
[01:41] <west333> appamatto: you could install unetbootin.exe and download the liveCD image and then use that to burn the ISO to the USB stick
[01:41] <appamatto> cls How?
[01:41] <crazycory22> how do i get open sshd started?
[01:41] <appamatto> I don't understand why they don't just provide memstick images
[01:42] <escott> crazycory22, it should start automatically if openssh-server is installed. you can also sudo service ssh start
[01:42] <west333> because the ISO is a compressed format  it would take up too much bandwidth
[01:42] <h00k> crazycory22: sudo service ssh start
[01:43] <crazycory22> ty.  it is already started.  just not smart enough to realize that
[01:44] <crazycory22> someone is going to try to ssh into my computer to help me fix this stupid thing
[01:44] <ultreia> omg
[01:45] <tats> no, it's not working. still no menus or dashboard
[01:45] <ultreia> how are they going to ssh into a computer with no working networking?
[01:45] <Lucenut> Can someone tell me how to turn off the balloons in pidgin when a friend comes online?
[01:46] <crazycory22> it is connected via wire

[01:47] <ultreia> I got told all my ideas were stupid and didn't apply in Anthony's real situation, so I gave up
[01:48] <xangua> Lucenut: tools, plugins, search for Libnotify plugin and disable the start session messages (not good idea to disable the plugin itself if you are using unity)
[01:48] <west333> hmmm , ya I would have sat back too

[01:53] <Ben64> "screen"
[01:53] <lupin> is there a reason it says 32bit is recommended? as far as i know computers haven't been 32 bit in quite some time
[01:53] <tats> Ben64: sorry, I don't know how to check that.
[01:53] <Ben64> lupin: 64 bit doesn't work on 32 bits
[01:53] <Ben64> tats: when you log in, click the ubuntu icon
[01:54] <Ben64> before you log in*
[01:54] <lupin> Ben64: that is it? there isn't any true benefit from 32 bit other than people who have no clue on what hardware they're using?
[01:54] <Ben64> it'll give you choices like "Ubuntu" "Ubuntu 2d" or others
[01:54] <Ben64> lupin: right
[01:54] <ultreia> lupin, 64 isn't 100% "mature" yet, unless you are using an AMD64
=== FreakingTea is now known as STF_
[01:55] <tats> Ben64, ultreia: I think I might have get it fixed. by running sudo apt-get install unity (duh). I just don't get why the upgrade removed it. at least the menus are back. let me check if everything is back to normal.
[01:55] <lupin> ultreia: i'm using an intel i5
[01:55] <escott> ultreia, what?
[01:55] <escott> lupin, use the 64bit image unless you have a small amount of ram <2GB or so
[01:56] <lupin> escott: i5 with 4gb ram nvidia graphics
[01:56] <Ben64> i'd say use the 64bit anyway, its easier to upgrade ram than architecture
[01:56] <crazycory22> i have 4gb and had to use the 32bit...even though i have an AMD Turion 64bit processor
=== STF_ is now known as STFiswrong
[01:56] <ultreia> 64 is always pretty perfect on an AMD64, on other chipsets sometimes there are HW issues because Intel is only faking AMD's 64 bit implementation
[01:56] <Ben64> ultreia: um...
[01:56] <escott> lupin, having 64bit really isn't about how much ram you have so much as the additional registers and instructions available only in x86-64
[01:57] <kewel> I got minitube installed in lubuntu, now I do I add an icon in the menu bar?
[01:58] <PatrickDickey> kewel: http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Main_Menu might help. It talks about adding entries to the Main Menu on LXDE (Lubuntu's desktop)
[01:59] <kewel> patrickdickey: wonderful, thankyou!
[02:00] <west333> My DT is an AMD64 athlon 4600+  never an issue running 64 bit  *nix
[02:00] <west333> my 2 lappies are 32 bit tho
[02:01] <west333> those 2 are running  Lubuntu
[02:01] <PatrickDickey> west333: are they having problems?
[02:02] <west333> mine no , I was referrencing a remark in the forum
[02:02] <PatrickDickey> Ahh ok. I missed that (since I just joined).
[02:02] <west333> np
[02:03] <ultreia> well, you must go with 64 if you have more than 4gb ram
[02:04] <ezrafree> can anyone recommend whether or not postfix+dovecot is the way to go if i want virtual users/domains?
[02:07] <ultreia> Robot Devil !
[02:08] <PatrickDickey> ezrafree: I'm not sure how well it works for that, but I use it for sending logs from my home server to my gmail account. It's pretty easy to set up.

[03:02] <massey_> I disabled bluetooth from the icon on the top left and my network manager stopped recognizing any and all wireless networks

[03:02] <massey_> I'm not sure if disabling bluetooth was related to that but they happened almost at the same time
[03:02] <massey_> and when I try to re-enable bluetooth I can't; it's all greyed out and nothing is clickable

[03:09] <dr_willis> you can firt it on smaller.. but thats getting in the way of doing any real work eith it newbie-
[03:10] <west333> ActionParsnip:  do you think if massey_  runs rfkill list  it will say if the Bluetooth is soft blocked ?
[03:10] <massey_> why don't I run it and see :-)
[03:10] <massey_> Brb have to get my charger
[03:10] <west333> try it
[03:11] <west333>  CLI   rfkill list
[03:11] <newbie-> n
[03:11] <west333> in CLI window
[03:12] <tripelb> if anyone remembers me. i reinstalled windows. i fear all my old disks so till later.
[03:13] <west333> massey  you might have to run it  as  rfkill list bluetooth
[03:13] <massey_> rfkill list says that dell-bluetooth is soft blocked and hard blocked
[03:13] <west333> ok
[03:13] <massey_> so is wifi
[03:14] <confused-> .
[03:14] <tripelb> used win xp. i dont understand ant atvantages to 7.
[03:14] <west333>  hard blocked is a physical lock out , soft block is undone with  sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
[03:14] <massey_> is there any way to unblock it / would that solve my problem?
[03:14] <tripelb> used win xp. i dont understand ANY aDvantages to 7.
[03:14] <west333> so if the dongle has a switch  give it  a flip on
[03:15] <dr_willis> tripelb:  i use cp/m i dont see any advantages to 16+bit os;s
[03:15] <confused-> I want to make a dualboot win/ubuntu on a new 60GB SSD, wha sizes to partition prior to putting win 7?
[03:16] <west333> you could also try  sudo rfkill unblock wifi
[03:16] <dr_willis> confused-:  ubuntu can be happy with 20-30gb. and do 'real' work.
[03:16] <massey_> west333: hmm, I ran both sudo rfkill unblock wifi / bluetooth but a subsequent rfkill list has the same output as before
[03:16] <dr_willis> confused-:  windows may  be hard to fit totally on a 60gb hd
[03:16] <massey_> i.e. they're both still softblocked
[03:16] <west333> hmmm
=== |_ocke2 is now known as |_ocke
[03:17] <west333> ok, look at  rfkill --help  and see if anything in there might also e worth trying b
[03:17] <rubiconjosh> I wrote a program in C++ using Qt that listens too a TCP port, I just wrote a basic Python program that auto runs on my raspberry pi so that when it boots up it connects to my server program over the network, now I am going to add modules to both the client and the server program to handle things like a webcam and motor controllers. Anyone else working on something similar?
[03:17] <west333> you system is somewhat different than mine
[03:18] <newbie|2> this my first ubuntu install.  :)
[03:18] <rubiconjosh> bah wrong channel, sorry
[03:19] <west333>  for instance  wlan  or...?
[03:19] <massey_> no new options really
[03:19] <west333> try  all for the option
[03:19] <newbie|2> not messed with linux in long time
[03:19] <massey_> I did
[03:19] <west333> then shut off others in turn until you find the one controlling the dongle
[03:19] <west333> ohh ok
[03:20] <newbie|2> wish me luck or not
[03:20] <massey_> I'm confused; what's a dongle?
[03:20] <west333> try a log out and back ?  after the setting changes
[03:20] <west333> bluetooth dongle
[03:20] <west333> if not onboard
[03:21] <ActionParsnip> west333: it'll show it, needs sudo though
[03:21] <massey_> okay I'll give that a shot
[03:21] <massey_> oh
[03:21] <massey_> i
[03:21] <massey_> would there be a corresponding dongle for wifi as well?
[03:21] <west333> thanks ActionParsnip
[03:21] <west333> newer lappies have it built in . mines a usb dongle
[03:22] <massey_> still not recognizing any networks; still not letting me change bluetooth settings
[03:22] <west333> no   wifi is onboard  801.g/b/n etc
[03:22] <massey_> ActionParsnip: when I run it with sudo it has the same output as when I don't
[03:23] <west333> if you didn't plug anything into a usb port  then the sevice is onboard
[03:23] <massey_> ah got it
[03:23] <party> #programming
[03:23] <massey_> could the reason unblock isn't working be that they're also Hard Blocked?
[03:24] <west333> yup BUT..... it will say  in the  rfkill list  listing
[03:24] <massey_> it does say that they're hard blocked in the output to rfkill list
[03:25] <massey_> is it possible to un- hard block them?
[03:25] <west333> else try this ,,,     sudo lshw -c network .... then wait for a minute or so ,,,,  it will give you the status of all network devices
[03:25] <west333> soft or/and hard vblocked
[03:25] <tripelb> dr_willis: i need to learn what you mean. what has a 16bit os? i thot all was 32 now 64.
[03:26] <ActionParsnip> 16bit OS, hahhaha
[03:27] <massey_> west333: that command has interesting output. The first line is "*-network DISABLED" and it goes on to list details about my wireless interface
[03:27] <west333> massey_:  unhard blocking is done by you turning it off via a physical switch or  Fn + <key> combo
[03:27] <massey_> and then further down there's "*-network" without "DISABLED" and it lists details about ethernet
[03:27] <west333> yea its a handy  command that one
=== [[[franco]]][[of is now known as [[franco]][[off]
[03:27] <massey_> ah, would you know the key combo / how I could find it?

[03:28] <ActionParsnip> 16bit OS, max ram is 65kb
[03:28] <west333> try  Fn +F2

[03:38] <onekt> looking to set up working bluetooth PAN on 12.04,  so far,  all guides have let to failure.  Any references appreciated.
[03:38] <zombiejim> Could anyone please let me know the best way to install Nvidia drivers on ubuntu 12.04
[03:38] <bazhang> zombiejim, what card
[03:38] <dr_willis> zombiejim:  i just install the nvidia-current package
[03:38] <zombiejim> bazhang, I am using the 310m laptop
[03:39] <dr_willis> zombiejim:  if you have an optimus based system - that adds difficulty
[03:39] <bazhang> zombiejim, have you tried nvidia-current package
[03:39] <zombiejim> I have yet to try anything as I would like to do it the correct way the first, websites such as softpedia claim i need to add repository's to do that
[03:39] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, if you have an optimus system look at bumblebee
[03:39] <zombiejim> rubiconjosh, how do I know if its an optimus system
[03:40] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, is it a laptop that has an nvidia card and onboard graphics?
[03:40] <zombiejim> rubiconjosh, yes
[03:40] <sgo11> hi, just install ubuntu 12.10 (gnome remix). where is "language support"? I don't find it in system settings. I would like to set "Keyboard Input Method System". where can I set it? thanks.
[03:40] <_helios_> [[franco]][[off], Esto no es una red buena para hablar de DDOS o botnet
[03:40] <ClientAlive> when formatting an ext4 filesystem on a logical valume (lvm2) are there options that would optimize for many small files being stored on it?
[03:40] <bazhang> _helios_, stop that NOW
[03:40] <_helios_> bazhang, I just told him this is not the place for botnet or ddos sorry
[03:41] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, then it is, search for bumblebee, I have never used it, but someone in here with very limited knowledge was successful using it last night
[03:41] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, http://bumblebee-project.org/
[03:41] <zombiejim> rubiconjosh, so it's not recommend to do install nvidia-current that is what the steam website and softpedia say but I have heard of bumblebee as well
[03:43] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, adding the ppa and installing nvidia-current is for 'regular' systems that do not use optimus. Like the desktop I am on, I have integrated graphics, but I have a GTX 670, that is what the nvidia driver is designed for. Some laptops are designed to run some applications with onboard graphics and some with the nvidia card, they do this to save battery. The nvidia drivers for linux AFAIK do not support optimus on
[03:43] <rubiconjosh> linux currently, the bumblebee project is aiming to support it.
[03:44] <zombiejim> rubiconjosh, http://www.geforce.com/drivers/results/56283
[03:44] <zombiejim> rubiconjosh, that is my graphics card
[03:45] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, read the very bottom of that page, it talks about optimus, right above the 'See the README' line
[03:45] <sgo11> where can I ask questions related to ubuntu gnome remix? thanks.
[03:46] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, I honestly do not know a lot about optimus, if you are not sure your laptop uses it search for your laptop model number, it should be mentioned in the specifications for that model
[03:47] <ActionParsnip> zombiejim: look into bumblebee
=== guest-9ZVxtE is now known as FattyMatty
[03:48] <zombiejim> I am following bumblebees instructions now, I'm assuming I skip the x-swat/x-updates command because im using 12.04 and not 11.04
[03:48] <FattyMatty> Ubuntu is turning into windows

[03:48] <xangua> sgo11: gnome remix is just a metapackage , there is also ubuntu-gnome

[03:48] <xangua> there is also #ubuntu-gnome sgo11
[03:49] <zombiejim> If you are on Ubuntu 11.04 or older and want newer drivers (recommended) than the ones available in the official repos, run:
[03:49] <sgo11> xangua, thanks. I am in that channel now. I just can't find language support from system settings.
[03:49] <zombiejim> Is that outdated and I should do the same for 12.04?
[03:49] <_helios_> FattyMatty, Ubuntu is far from being Windows considering it's already 100x better than Windows and more powerful.
[03:50] <FattyMatty> _helios_, Humm I dont know. I've been using Debi
[03:50] <rubiconjosh> zombiejim, I have never installed Bumblebee, I would read the guide on the website i provided and this, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee, also check out #bumblebee
[03:50] <FattyMatty> for nearly nine years
[03:50] <FattyMatty> Users
[03:50] <FattyMatty> are lazy and want windows and clicky things
[03:50] <FattyMatty> but want to tell everyone they use Linux
[03:50] <dr_willis> how dare they expect things to get easier to use....
[03:53] <rubiconjosh> Is anyone running dual monitors? If so have you had success it making notifications appear on your left monitor?
[03:53] <_helios_> I have a good question, why are they going to support 12.04 longer than the new 12.10?
[03:53] <xangua> !lts | _helios_
[03:53] <ubottu> _helios_: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[03:53] <bazhang> _helios_, its LTS
[03:53] <zombiejim> well its downloading 400 megs for bumblebee hoping it works, immediately after installing ubuntu it was telling me my video drivers were crashing for hockey
[03:54] <_helios_> So should I switch to 12.04 or just keep 12.10? is 12.04 weaker what would I loose if I went to 12.04?
[03:54] <sgo11> anyone know why there is no "Language Support" in ubuntu gnome remix 12.10? thanks.
[03:54] <sgo11> under system settings.
[03:54] <west333> as a for instance  I use  12.04 on all 3 of my boxes , i just pulled unity off and put  LXDE on for my lappies
[03:55] <majnoon> what is the name of the audio settings app in unity ?
[03:55] <rubiconjosh> _helios_, LTS just means it will be updated with security fixes and bugs longer than a non LTS release. You will be fine with either version, most likely if you are a home user you will not keep the same version for 3-5 years anyway

[03:55] <bianca> how do i install a .rpm file?
[03:55] <west333> pulse audio  is another
[03:55] <ActionParsnip> bianca: you can use alien but I recommend you try find a deb
[03:55] <rubiconjosh> !rpm | bianca
[03:55] <ubottu> bianca: RPM is the RedHat Package Management system. Ubuntu uses !APT, not RPM. RPM packages are not supported (the package "alien" can allow installing them, but it's quite dangerous and unsupported)
[03:55] <dr_willis> bianca:  best is to NOT use rpms on ubuntu
[03:55] <histo> bianca: Are you sure there isn't a deb availbe for your application?
[03:55] <ActionParsnip> bianca: why do you want to use an RPM?
[03:56] <_helios_> rubiconjosh, ah ok, I'll keep the 12.10, does anyone know if there is a new version on the way or they just gonna soup up 12.10 make it more stable?
[03:56] <RollinV2> ubuntu may become a rolling release distro
[03:56] <bianca> theres a .tar.tz aswell? but i dont know how to install it either
[03:56] <dr_willis> !release | _helios_
[03:56] <ubottu> _helios_: Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 18 months to 5 years. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
[03:56] <bianca> itts for adobe flash
[03:56] <rubiconjosh> !releases | _helios_
[03:56] <dr_willis> _helios_:  next release is 13.04
[03:57] <dr_willis> bianca:  theres flash installers in the repos
[03:57] <ActionParsnip> bianca: flash is in the repos, you don't need an RPM
[03:57] <_helios_> cool, I can't wait to try it out
[03:57] <rubiconjosh> _helios_, Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months
[03:57] <ActionParsnip> _helios_: its pre-release, expect issues. Support is in #ubuntu+1
[03:58] <ActionParsnip> bianca: even using the tar.gz and putting the file in the browser plugin folder is better
[03:58] <_helios_> rubiconjosh, wow that's impressive every six months a new free OS that's impressive.
[03:58] <bianca> what the hell.. it says i already have it but 2 mins ago it said i need to download it
[03:58] <bianca> >_> nevermind its working now
[03:58] <ActionParsnip> bianca: rpm files are not for ubuntu, and using alien can cause issues
[03:58] <dr_willis> _helios_:  its not new.. its updated.. with some changes.

[03:58] <ActionParsnip> kDM`: what wifi chip does it use?
[03:59] <kDM`> I'm not sure. :/ How would I check that? :)
[03:59] <RollinV2> _helios_, i recommend staying with the most up to date LTS release. you don't have to update every 6months
[03:59] <rubiconjosh> kDM`, lsusb
[03:59] <_helios_> dr_willis, cool beans, I've been telling everyone at my college to switch to Ubuntu but allot of people are glued to that horrible Microsoft product.
[03:59] <ActionParsnip> kDM`: sudo lshw -C network     may show it, or:  lsusb
[04:00] <_helios_> RollinV2, I'll prob stay with 12.1064-bit for awhile because it's pretty bugles
[04:00] <ActionParsnip> kDM`: how could you stop using Ubuntu due to the wifi adapter, when you don't even know the wifi chip?
[04:00] <west333> majnoon:  the audio settings  app that i use is   <pavucontrol>  you can install it  with  sudo apt-get install  pavucontrol
[04:00] <kDM`> :/
[04:01] <_helios_> I have my laptop with 12.10 64-bit runs like a champ everything is compatible, then I have a desktop running Xubuntu 12.10 64bit
[04:01] <RollinV2> _helios_, if you already have 12.10 installed stick with it. easier then backtracking to 12.04.
[04:01] <west333> sounds like he hard blocked it  like massey did inadvertantly
[04:02] <ActionParsnip> kDM`: if lshw shows the chip, use it to find guides
[04:02] <ActionParsnip> kDM`: if not, use the 8 character hex id to find guides
[04:03] <ActionParsnip> kDM`: personally. I'd ditch the non-working usb stick and research a little, find one that can be made to work very easily (broadcom for example) or one that works out of the box
[04:03] <ActionParsnip> kDM`: usb wifi is stupendously cheap

[04:04] <RollinV2> any way to remove unity/dash and keep the top global menu? or do i need to install gnome and start over?
[04:06] <ActionParsnip> RollinV2: install gnome-panel, log off and log in to the new session
[04:07] <west333> RollinV2:  try LXDE
[04:07] <RollinV2> ActionParsnip, ill try that. sorry for the novice question but i get confused what uninstalls what. really want to keep the global menu but nothing else.
[04:09] <RollinV2> west333, better than xfce?
[04:09] <west333> RollinV2:  LXDE is wayyyyy better
[04:09] <west333>  LXDE is like gnome  but with taskbar at bottom . and  kde lite
[04:10] <ActionParsnip> RollinV2: you can add a global menu in xfce
[04:10] <west333> it uses openbox window manager
[04:10] <west333>  more functionality , low  resources
[04:11] <ActionParsnip> west333: like razorqt :)
[04:11] <ActionParsnip> west333: kde light

[04:13] <ituvox> Hello. I am having trouble getting an epson multifunctional scanner to work under ubuntu 12.04, using any utility. The scanner is model Tx133, and I've already tried installing iscan, over and over, which should work for this model. The scanner seems to be detected well, but running iscan or xsane just stalls, and doesn't do anything until I unplug it, when it gives a communication error.
[04:14] <west333> so here are the screenshots ,,   lxde.org/image_galleries/screenshots
[04:14] <west333> copy and paste to browser
[04:15] <ActionParsnip> ituvox: if you run:  lsusb   do you see a USB ID for the device?
[04:15] <ituvox> Bus 003 Device 004: ID 04b8:0883 Seiko Epson Corp.
[04:15] <RollinV2> west333, im a command line junkie. you should have told me to wget the images.
[04:15] <ituvox> Should it detect a different one for the scanner and printer though?
[04:15] <west333> RollinV2:  ok..
[04:15] <ituvox> Or just one for the whole device is fine?
[04:15] <west333>  next time
[04:16] <RollinV2> west333, um.. not sure i like default lxde. its way too windows like. and im raging hard on win8 right now.
[04:16] <west333> RollinV2:  so I installed  LXDE via synaptic .. logout ,,, session lxde . then removed unity
[04:17] <RollinV2> west333, thanks for reminding me to have a fallback in place before removing unity
[04:17] <west333> ok , then  gnome 3.4.2 I guess
[04:17] <ActionParsnip> ituvox: does that ID give you guides?
[04:17] <west333> that mine
[04:17] <west333> that's*
[04:18] <ituvox> ActionParsnip: What do you mean? If I search for it on the internet?
[04:18] <RollinV2> west333, ohh.
[04:18] <RollinV2> brb. relogin
[04:19] <ituvox> All i've been able to find are things I've already tried.

[04:23] <rubiconjosh> Is anyone running dual monitors? If so have you had success at moving notifications to the left monitor?
[04:25] <west333> yup rubiconjosh  i run dual on both lappies here
[04:25] <rubiconjosh> west333, is your main monitor setup to be the left or right monitor?
[04:25] <west333> you nedto run xrandr
[04:25] <west333> left
[04:26] <rubiconjosh> west333,  if you run notify-send "test" does the notifcation appear on the left monitor or right monitor
[04:27] <west333> you need to set up a script in  ~/.config /autostart/LxRandR.desktop

[04:28] <rubiconjosh> west333, thank you. I have been scowering bug reports trying to find out how to fix this, I will look for an example script
[04:28] <ituvox> Should I create the file?
[04:28] <west333> rubiconjosh:  okey doky ,, ya I cant post it in here ,,
[04:29] <west333> but its about 5 lines of code
[04:29] <rubiconjosh> west333, PM, pastebin or email it to me?
[04:30] <ituvox> Or is there another syntax for these files in ubuntu
[04:30] <west333> I'll see if pastebin takes a copy of mine
[04:30] <ituvox> should it be something like 70-pesistent-usb.rules ?
[04:32] <antonio_> aloha folks
[04:32] <west333> rubiconjosh:  Done deal go have a look
[04:33] <west333> under my nick
[04:33] <ActionParsnip> ituvox: yes, you make the new file
[04:33] <antonio_> sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install
[04:33] <antonio_> whoops..
[04:33] <ituvox> And just call it 10-local.rules ? Okay
[04:34] <antonio_> actionparsnip: last night you told me how to back up a list of my installed packages to my-packages...how do I re-install them?
[04:34] <antonio_> don't I just use sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install
[04:35] <ActionParsnip> !clone | antonio_
[04:35] <ubottu> antonio_: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type « aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages », move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type « sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install » (this may cause problems with multiarch before 12.10) - See also !automate

[04:37] <west333> yep tripelb  I want one
[04:37] <ituvox> ActionParsnip: The permissions have been fixed, now I can scanimage -L as a normal user. Thank you. However, running iscan and xsane still results in stalling.

[04:38] <testing_> @actionparsnip `sudo apt-get install aptitude`?
[04:39] <ActionParsnip> antonio_: you will need to install aptitude
[04:39] <ClientAlive> does anyone know if there's a way to add items under "computer" in the pane in nautilus?
[04:39] <ActionParsnip> antonio_: if you are using 64bit OS and need multiarch then aptitude may moan
[04:40] <antonio_> you mean it'll nag like a woman? ;)
[04:40] <ActionParsnip> !aptitude
[04:40] <ubottu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[04:41] <testing_> @ClientAlive Ctrl+D
[04:41] <testing_> (although that goes to bookmarks pane, not computer pane)
[04:41] <west333> rubiconjosh:  it wont let me paste into that window
[04:42] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: add it as a bookmark, it will also show in the quick menu in the right click
[04:42] <ClientAlive> testing_: oh, yeah but I meant specifically under "Computer" in that pane
[04:42] <testing_> Why? bookmarks pane is right above
[04:42] <ClientAlive> I would prefer it not be separate (just more convenient for me)
=== tree_ is now known as UBshanky
[04:42] <testing_> AFAIK you can't sorry..
[04:43] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: then you could make symlinks to the home folder for the things you desire
[04:43] <ClientAlive> ActionParsnip: I think that's the answer. I made ln -s inside a directory in the home direcotory. It's not really right like that
[04:44] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: no, thats why the bookmarks exist
[04:44] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: much neater
[04:45] <ClientAlive> I guess
[04:45] <ClientAlive> thx tho
[04:46] <west333> rubiconjosh:  it wont allow me to even type in that message window you have opened  let me try something

[04:49] <ituvox> I went ahead and installed the latest version of the iscan packages, but it still stalls as usual.
[04:50] <ActionParsnip> ituvox: does the new udev rule not work?
[04:51] <ituvox> It seems to work, scanimage -L now gives the expected output as a normal user
[04:51] <ituvox> But that was not the problem apparently
[04:51] <ActionParsnip> ituvox: are there bugs reported
[04:52] <ituvox> ActionParsnip: I don't know where to look for any, to be honest
[04:53] <ituvox> Of the driver you mean?
[04:54] <ActionParsnip> ituvox: look for bugs for the usb id or the make and model, or you can report your own

[05:09] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_: they probably won't. Why make an iso of the files?
[05:09] <unheeding> does anyone have any idea why you can't log in from the ctrl+alt+f1 command line?  It keeps saying that the system is going to halt in 4 minutes, but this persists after a restart
[05:10] <Wiz_> to burn the iso straight to dvd instead of using a GUI based program which seems to take longer
[05:11] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_: if you want a video dvd I recommend you use devede
[05:11] <west333> ActionParsnip:  some one probably dd'd those files to iso and retreiving them could be dangerous  with dd ..... would  unetbootin  uncompress thenm onto drive or flash media
[05:11] <mrlaw> some got dumps ?
[05:11] <ActionParsnip> west333: both ways are fine in newer releases
[05:11] <west333> or say  k3b
[05:11] <Wiz_> when i use that the iso file that gets created is not playable either
[05:11] <west333> ok
[05:12] <west333>  was thinking dd might brick his OS if a typo ensued
[05:12] <ActionParsnip> west333: unetbootin is just a bit more user friendly
[05:12] <west333> ^5
[05:12] <ActionParsnip> west333: oh sure, dd can become (d)ata (d)estroyer if used incorrectly
[05:12] <west333> lol  yup
[05:13] <ActionParsnip> Wiz_: if you loop mount the iso file, you should be able to play the contents

[05:55] <DWSR> Was, in the process of not doing it. Already installed FreeNX.
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> !vnc | DWSR
[05:56] <ubottu> DWSR: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> DWSR: vnc has zero security
[05:56] <DWSR> ActionParsnip: I know.
[05:56] <DWSR> ActionParsnip: I already have FreeNX installed. I'm de-forwarding everything right now. I'll probably also uninstall vino
[05:56] <DWSR> !package vino
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> DWSR: so using an ssh tunnel is good, port forwarding to vino isn't a good idea
[05:56] <histo> DWSR: Can you change your default vnc port
[05:56] <histo> DWSR: or install fail2ban and right your own jail
[05:57] <DWSR> histo: Just uninstalling Vino.
[05:57] <DWSR> and de-forwarding.
[05:57] <ActionParsnip> or use ssh for everything and ditch vnc all together
[05:58] <histo> DWSR: I would use ssh tunnel to vnc and add fail2ban to stop people from brute forcing ssh
[05:58] <ActionParsnip> DWSR: what do you do on the remote PC?
[05:58] <ActionParsnip> DWSR: once you get connected?
[05:58] <DWSR> ActionParsnip: Not much.
[05:59] <DWSR> again, mostly just for my vbox iTunes installation.
[05:59] <ActionParsnip> DWSR: you can manage vbox via web ui

[06:32] <koumorileo> hi guys ... new to linux made the change about a week ago ... for media servers i'm using rygel w/ dlna .... but i see PLEX in the ubuntu software center .... anyone have exp with plex and its functions ?
[06:32] <ActionParsnip> koumorileo: I use plex
[06:33] <koumorileo> yah ? any chance u can give me a run down of the difference between plex and rygel ?
[06:33] <bianca> im trying to install a program in the ubuntu software center, and it says its free, but theres no download button, it just ghas a buy button
[06:34] <ActionParsnip> koumorileo: ive not used rygel.
[06:34] <Noskcaj> how can i re-direct the .cache folder to a different HDD. also how can i overclock an AMD GPU in Ubuntu?
[06:34] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: use a symlink
[06:34] <koumorileo> rygel runs in terminal
[06:35] <Noskcaj> ActionParsnip, ok
[06:35] <koumorileo> and i connect to it using my ps3 and my android products
[06:35] <bianca> why would you need to overclock? if you need to overclock for ubuntu then im guessing your gpu is too old to safely overclock >_<
[06:35] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: I use a symlink from /run/google-chrome to ~/.cache/google-chrome   to speed up the web a little

[06:38] <mulray> i want to uninstall ubuntu and regain my original partition scheme
[06:38] <mulray> is that possible
[06:38] <BillyZane> does anyone know how to get a creative sound blaster z to work on ubuntu 12.10?
[06:39] <ActionParsnip> mulray: sure, you can use gparted to setup the new partition scheme if you want
[06:39] <Noskcaj> ActionParsnip, how do i make a symlink? would it be easier to mount .cache in RAM?
[06:40] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: move the folder to where you desire, then link to it
[06:40] <Noskcaj> ok
[06:40] <anonraptr> mulray: if what your asking is can you go back to the single partition you originally had and not have to reinstall your OS, im not so sure. you may not like that answer
[06:40] <Noskcaj> ActionParsnip, i still don't really understand
[06:41] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: you want .cache on another partition
[06:41] <Noskcaj> on another drive (ssd to HDD)
[06:41] <mulray> anaonraptr - i think gparted might work i'll just reboot to another medium
[06:41] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: so you copy the folder to the other partition (lets say it's mounted to /media/part1   you will then get the cache folder really at /media/part1/.cache
[06:42] <mulray> only thing i might have trouble with is grub
[06:42] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: the physical storage is moot
[06:42] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: you can then run:  ln -s /media/part1/.cache ~/.cache
[06:42] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: this will make a link to the moved folder, the OS will see the link as if it was the folder, and nothing has changed
[06:43] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: yet the actual storage of the cache folder is really on /media/part1
[06:43] <anonraptr> til that gparted kicks azz and i formatted and reinstalled os for no good reason last month..  lol
[06:43] <Noskcaj> ActionParsnip, i think i understand, thanks. any idea for OCing my GPU?
[06:45] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: never had to do it, sorry
[06:46] <ActionParsnip> Noskcaj: when you installed you could have made your /home partition on the platter based drive and have no issue. Also make sure your swap is not on the SSD too
[06:47] <Noskcaj> ActionParsnip, will do, i wanted most of /home to be on the ssd

[08:05] <PatrickC> ok, so i'm totatlly new to setting up ubuntu from scratch.
=== pug is now known as Guest19427
[08:06] <histo> west333: the driver should be loaded even if the card is not active.
[08:06] <PatrickC> i wanted to do a complete setup, so i went with a 12.10 minimal install. is there a good guide on installing a DM/WM?
[08:06] <histo> west333: assuming you are correct he just needs to activate a different card with an asound file. Although I've never seen hardware like this.
[08:06] <vlaca> histo: one of the cards shows up as UNCLAIMED
[08:07] <iceroot> PatrickC: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop   or use xubuntu-desktop  or kubuntu-desktop  or lubuntu-desktop to get unity, xfce4, kde or lxde
[08:07] <garnet> http://www.erichufschmid.net/Linux/Linux4.html
[08:07] <west333> histo  yea , the  later I was thinking
[08:07] <west333> latter&
[08:07] <PatrickC> iceroot: thanks
[08:07] <arunkumar413> vlaca: its not being lazy. its about time. people have work. They do jobs, they need to earn living. i spend working 12 hours in office and sleep only for 4 hours in a day.
[08:08] <histo> arunkumar413: Thank god you didn't experience any bugs in windows.
[08:08] <garnet> histo: I didn't too.
[08:08] <PatrickC> does anyone know what DM elementryos uses?
[08:08] <PatrickC> or is that not ubuntu based?
[08:09] <vlaca> arunkumar413: have we not tried to help you? yes. have you even provided the exact model of the laptop? no. that's why we suggested you to look for others who had a similar issue
[08:09] <arunkumar413> vlaca: i rarely use windows. It's just the sound quality which in noticed
[08:09] <histo> arunkumar413: what model laptop do you have?
[08:09] <dr_willis>   they may have their own dm
[08:09] <majnoon> histo, he no have bugs in windows ? he must not be doing something right
[08:10] <anonraptr> i have been running ubuntu 12.10 and its kind of a full featured beast. Tried Lubuntu today and it was fast and slick and easy to use. The machine I have ubuntu on is already a duelboot with backtrack 5 r3. can i cange ubuntu 12.10 to Lubuntu without losing the backtrack partition?
[08:10] <arunkumar413> vlaca: this is my laptop http://www.flipkart.com/combo-hp-pavilion-g6-2005ax-laptop-apu-quad-core-a8-4gb-500gb-win7-hb-1-5gb-graph/p/itmdaa2xq7jnnvch
[08:11] <vlaca> arunkumar413: it was histo who asked for the model, not me
[08:11] <arunkumar413> histo: http://www.flipkart.com/combo-hp-pavilion-g6-2005ax-laptop-apu-quad-core-a8-4gb-500gb-win7-hb-1-5gb-graph/p/itmdaa2xq7jnnvch
[08:11] <garnet> arunkumar413: Question. Does Windows work on your laptop?
[08:11] <arunkumar413> garnet: yes
[08:12] <west333> histo  just off the wall as an idea ,, if he sets up *nix on his box with  onboard sound as default  . then later adds card , but card is not seated correctly or some -such to which the added isnt detected
[08:12] <garnet> Then why are you spending your time breaking things and trying to install an OS which doesn't?
[08:12] <histo> arunkumar413: I don't see a single result for someone experiencing the behavior you are. Are you play the same audio file in both OS's?
[08:12] <west333> then it would make sense that the driver is afk or non-operative
[08:12] <histo> west333: he's runnning a lappy
[08:13] <west333> kk
[08:13] <histo> anonraptr: apt-get install lubuntu-desktopp
[08:13] <histo> anonraptr: and remove the ubuntu desktop stuff.
[08:13] <arunkumar413> histo: yes, the surround is missing in linux where as in windows the surround sound is good
[08:14] <histo> arunkumar413: it's a laptop it has fake surround. You need to open alsamixer and check your levels for the surround.
[08:14] <histo> arunkumar413: most likely your other "channels" are turned down or muted
[08:15] <arunkumar413> histo: then how to enable them
[08:15] <histo> arunkumar413: with alsamixer   You can run that in a terminal
[08:15] <arunkumar413> histo: which sound is ubuntu using is it oss or alsa
[08:15] <histo> arunkumar413: the volume manager may have the ability to add those channels as well.
[08:16] <arunkumar413> histo: in the default sound applet it is not showing the other channels
[08:17] <arunkumar413> histo: now installing the alsa mixer
[08:17] <histo> arunkumar413: there is somewhere to enable the other channels.  Edit preferences or something. I don't use unity so I can't look for you.
[08:18] <histo> arunkumar413: or alsamixer will show all of them under the playback menu
[08:18] <Ben64> i don't think there are other channels
[08:18] <histo> Ben64: My laptop has them
[08:19] <histo> Ben64: with my dolby home theater whatever garbage sound system.
[08:19] <Ben64> how do you have it hooked to your system
[08:20] <arunkumar413> histo: no alsamixer not showing the channels. it just shows master volume level, mic level, etc,,,....
[08:21] <histo> Ben64: it's built into the lappy. Here... let me post screen shot
[08:21] <histo> arunkumar413: press F3
[08:21] <histo> arunkumar413: or F5 for all
[08:21] <arunkumar413> histo: f3 is for brightneess
[08:21] <west333> arunkumar413:  I see that you are looking for a decent sound control GUI , try  pavucontrol it works for the alsa system via pulse audio   the instal for that if you like is   sudo apt-get install pavucontrol
[08:22] <histo> Ben64: arunkumar413 http://imagebin.org/244024
[08:22] <west333> it will obviously add on the depends for your spin
[08:22] <histo> arunkumar413: no F3 in alsamixer is for playback, F4 is for capture levels, F5 is for all
[08:22] <Ben64> histo: because its hdmi
[08:23] <histo> Ben64: not it's not
[08:23] <Ben64> it says so
[08:23] <histo> Ben64: yes there is a hdmi out on the laptop but i'm not using it.
[08:23] <Ben64> thats why you have the extra channels
[08:24] <phongdatgl> share wallpaper :D
[08:24] <histo> phongdatgl: what my tron lightcycle?
[08:25] <subcool> can someone help me- i screwed up my home directory permissions

[08:25] <ubottu> Bliso: It's not technically our business, but we'd like to tell you that IRC'ing as root is a Very Bad Idea (tm). After all, doing anything as root when root is not needed is bad, and especially bad with software that connects to the Internet.
[08:25] <west333> we just went over this

[08:27] <histo> arunkumar413: IDK then just a thought at something to try.  How did you discover this?  Are you playing the same audio file in Windows and Linux?
[08:27] <bluebeat09> hi. anyone using caffeine app in ubuntu 12.10?
[08:27] <Ben64> subcool: what are you trying to do
[08:27] <arunkumar413> histo: YES
[08:28] <Ben64> arunkumar413: whats the problem
[08:28] <arunkumar413> histo: sorry for capitasl
[08:28] <subcool> i messed up the permissions to my directoryes
[08:28] <west333> subcool:  ok so specifically .... what is the issue with  files
[08:28] <Ben64> subcool: thats what you did, what were you trying to accomplish?
[08:28] <west333> etc
[08:28] <histo> subcool: chmod go-x
[08:29] <Ben64> don't do that ^
[08:29] <subcool> I have two folders. /media/Ext3Storage and /home/subcool - i need their permissions fixed
[08:29] <histo> subcool: chmod u+r go-x /home/subcool

[08:29] <west333> ok  you arnt follwing ,,,, initially  what files were bugging you for acces
[08:29] <histo> Ben64: Yes I meant the second one
[08:29] <Ben64> subcool: sudo chmod 755 /home/subcool
[08:29] <Ben64> histo: no that is bad as well
[08:29] <histo> Ben64: how's that?
[08:30] <Ben64> try removing execute bit on a folder and see what happens
[08:30] <histo> subcool: sorry that's right
[08:30] <arunkumar413> histo: i need to to these things to get good sound. 1. enable the correct audio device 2)configure the device to use the correct audio driver rather than default linux driver
[08:30] <subcool> k- thanks..
[08:30] <histo> subcool: should be chmod u+xrw g+r /home/subcool
[08:30] <kepler> 'sudo rm -fr /home/*' then pan handle in /usr
[08:30] <subcool> sorry- i wold tried to fix it on my own, but- i already messed it up
[08:30] <cristian_c> Hi
[08:30] <vlaca> arunkumar413: do you have proprietary linux drivers for your sound card?
[08:30] <Ben64> arunkumar413: have you tried "sudo apt-get remove pulseaudio"
[08:31] <bluebeat09> hi. anyone using caffeine app in ubuntu 12.10
[08:31] <cristian_c> I've enabled suspend with: dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend
[08:31] <Ben64> histo: why not just use octal?
[08:31] <histo> subcool: ll /home/
[08:31] <cristian_c> It works but when I try resume, a kernel panic occurs or desktop is unusable
[08:31] <Ben64> cristian_c: then stop resuming :|
[08:31] <cristian_c> If I launch chromium by the terminal, I get: pcilib: Cannot open /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:02.1/resource: No such file or directory
[08:31] <arunkumar413> Ben64: why should i remove the pulse audio
[08:31] <histo> Ben64: Becuaes it's easier for people to under stand ugo and +-wxr  ...
[08:31] <Ben64> arunkumar413: because it can make audio sound bad on certain systems
[08:31] <cristian_c> Ben64, but I must resume when I suspend
[08:32] <Ben64> cristian_c: then don't suspen
[08:32] <cristian_c> Ben64, why?
[08:32] <Ben64> because it messes up...
[08:32] <arunkumar413> Ben64: yes done
[08:33] <west333> ok  subcool   7 = r/w/x  6= r/w  4 =r  5 = r x  2= w , 4 =r  1= x , 0= nada ....... so your folders  for UGO , user /group / owner  should  be  7 55 as is a standard ,,, do we concur
[08:34] <cristian_c> Ben, ok, obviously at this moment I'm not running the suspension to pc
[08:34] <cristian_c> *Ben64
[08:34] <histo> west333: yes 755  lol wow did I typo the hell out of my suggestions
[08:34] <EskimoBob_afk>  Hi, any ideas where can I get libxul-embedding and nspr installed in *ubuntu?
[08:34] <cristian_c> How can I solve this problem?
[08:35] <histo> subcool: chmod 755 /home/subcool   will fix your ~
[08:35] <west333> subcool:  so we should have the  chattr  settings for those as  755
[08:35] <EskimoBob_afk> where do you buntu guys hide libxul-embedding and nspr?
[08:35] <vlaca> histo: that's 0755 :P
[08:35] <histo> yeah
[08:35] <west333>  or else if   chmod  dir / *  755
[08:36] <west333> or similar
[08:36] <Sajar> I have some questions about runlevels and services in ubuntu 12.4.01 LTS. Anyone who might be able to help?
[08:36] <EskimoBob_afk> anyone?
[08:36] <west333> -rv
[08:36] <west333>  ok slow typing
[08:36] <histo> west333: -R
[08:37] <histo> vlaca: chmod 755 works
[08:37] <west333> ok  - R = recursive
[08:37] <EskimoBob_afk> I need to get spice-xpi installed but missing libxul-embedding and nspr and searching has no usable results
[08:38] <vlaca> histo: apparently yes, it assume the mising digits are zeroes
[08:39] <histo> subcool: you could use the chmod -R 755 /home/subcool     or chmod -R u=rwx g=rx o=rx /home/subcool
[08:39] <cristian_c> Any ideas?
[08:39] <histo> subcool: althought that will make every file x
[08:39] <west333> subcool: chattr works best  my friend in CLI ...  do the man page on it   man chattr
[08:40] <subcool> so many options
[08:40] <west333> 755 is what you want on all except root  files
[08:40] <subcool> i used the basic one
[08:40] <west333> kk
=== ryanclancy000 is now known as Guest34212
[08:41] <subcool> 755 seemed to work
[08:41] <EskimoBob_afk> nspr is OK now I am still missing libxul-embedding
[08:41] <subcool> im trying to manage and use utorrent server for linux, because im tired wine and the other... im not winning this battle
[08:42] <histo> subcool: are you planning on serving torrents?
[08:42] <EskimoBob_afk> so any of yo know what pkg has libxul-embedding because I can not find it with find
[08:42] <subcool> histo, not really-
[08:42] <MonkeyDust> subcool  why not use transmission or deluge?
[08:42] <subcool> just enough to share what i dl
[08:42] <histo> subcool: What do you want just a cli app to dl torrents?
[08:42] <EskimoBob_afk> and google searches have returned 0 usable answers
[08:42] <west333> ya 755  is read all  execute owner
[08:42] <iceroot> when installing grub from a rescue cd will there be any issues? because its not the grub from the ubuntu cd (issues for upgrades) or should i always use the ubuntu-live cd to install grub?
[08:42] <qualia> does my MAC address change with operating system change ?
[08:43] <iceroot> qualia: no
[08:43] <west333> group read
[08:43] <histo> iceroot: No if it's grub2
[08:43] <EskimoBob_afk> iceroot: use the CD for start
[08:43] <subcool> originallly - i wanted to use the remote and such- but i recently realized that server doenst have any of those options.
[08:43] <cjae> is it better to encase a directory and it contents for transfer, even it the contents could not be compressed anymore. eg. a mp3 folder . would this make it not necessarily faster but a smoother transfer over various protocols?
[08:43] <histo> !grub2 > iceroot
[08:43] <ubottu> iceroot, please see my private message
[08:43] <iceroot> cjae: just use tar which is not compressing files
[08:43] <subcool> i like the remote app thats available.  - and i just cant seem to find a working environement
[08:44] <histo> cjae: wouldn't speedup anything.
[08:44] <cjae> iceroot: right but does a tared file make for a smoother transfer ?
[08:44] <histo> cjae: you could try using rsync and see if compression would speedup or not.  -n is a dry run.
[08:44] <cjae> histo: tried rsync already
[08:45] <histo> cjae: I would use rsync for a smooth transfer. I do offsite bakcups with it running as a cronjob.
[08:45] <subcool> im giving up for the night- its 4 am
[08:45] <iceroot> cjae: make what?
[08:45] <subcool> thanks for the help with my permissions..
[08:45] <histo> subcool: check out rtorrent whne you wake up
[08:45] <west333> subcool:  although its read /write  most time any writes to a file wil be logged  and you can track it  so 755 is a std method for new installs for ~/ files>
[08:46] <histo> west333: would the issue with -R 755 be that all files would then be +x instead of just rw
[08:46] <subcool> histo, i saw that on xbmc -
[08:46] <vlaca> west333: that's interesting, where are any writes to a file logged exactly?
[08:46] <EskimoBob_afk> Any ideas how (from what pkg) can I get libxul-embedding installed?
[08:46] <cjae> I mean it seems if I try to copy over the said folder with multiple small files, not compressed, the transfer speeds seem to struggle at point where the mulitple files are located
[08:47] <subcool> I really just like the ida of having the server running, and being able to add new torrent from my phone.
[08:47] <EskimoBob_afk> who ever has this chmod "problem" use http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/script2/chmodcal.shtml :)
[08:47] <EskimoBob_afk> LOL and learn what those numbers mean
[08:48] <cjae> pictures whatever, im not trying to get faster, it just "seems" that say one larger file doesnt go 5, 20,15, 2 27,2,13 MB/s
[08:48] <subcool> EskimoBob_afk, nice link- thanks
[08:48] <cjae> does that make any sense
[08:48] <EskimoBob_afk> subcool: np
[08:49] <vlaca> EskimoBob_afk: do you have something like libxul-dev installed
[08:49] <qiyong> this is x86_64, why do-release-upgrade tries to fetch binary-i386 ?
[08:49] <kjelle> .o/ Anyone know a good linux daemon to use as LDAP against other linux workstations (e.g. they use likewise to auth to this linux daemon) - but this linux daemon must be a sync (read-only AD) from a windows AD server.
[08:49] <EskimoBob_afk> cjae: no and there can be billions of reasons
[08:49] <kjelle> so Windows AD server -> sync ubuntu server. Linux clients LDAP auth -> ubuntu server. Which software could I use on my ubuntu server?
[08:49] <cjae> it would be nice to see just 20 all the time, so my question is ... is it worth it to bother tarring directories
[08:49] <histo> subcool: rtorrent is the way to go. It can monitor a directory for .torrent files and start dl'ng them
[08:50] <west333> histo  funny you  "menchion " it , my neighbor is a media scarf  and wanted me to rape my  * nix  box with tat windbloze  attache crud \
[08:50] <MonkeyDust> kjelle  there's zafra, zimbra, landscape
[08:50] <EskimoBob_afk> vlaca: there is no libxul-dev available
[08:51] <EskimoBob_afk> did you even try: aptitude search libxul-dev ?
[08:51] <histo> cjae: no
[08:51] <histo> cjae: for a safe transfer I would use rsync
[08:51] <kjelle> MonkeyDust: hmms okey.
[08:51] <vlaca> EskimoBob_afk: although it's about 9.10, see http://mozilla.6506.n7.nabble.com/where-to-get-libxul-embedding-for-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-td236628.html
[08:51] <kjelle> Ill check them out
[08:51] <histo> cjae: tar doens't compress at all.
[08:51] <qiyong> this is x86_64, why do-release-upgrade tries to fetch binary-i386 ?
[08:51] <vnc786> did "sudo apt-get -d install wine1.4" and all files are downloaded in "/var/cache/apt/archives" but when doing "dpkg -i wine* lib* zlib*" it is again asking for some dependencies
[08:51] <cjae> EskimoBob_afk: well I seem to get horrible transfers over smb, 20-30 MB/s at best, when I use NFS I get cpu topping at the box doing the writing, and if use ftp I get about 50 average
[08:51] <cjae> but who uses ftp
[08:51] <EskimoBob_afk> cjae: I have seen that page multiple times but this is no help
[08:52] <EskimoBob_afk> it's outdated and those pkg are no longer available
[08:52] <cjae> EskimoBob_afk: did nt send you a page
[08:52] <w00bi> how do I mount a samba share to a folder? Can't find a command that works
[08:52] <EskimoBob_afk> it was vlaca
[08:53] <halaszvarig> hi
[08:53] <vnc786> how do i give /var/cache/apt/archives has a source
[08:53] <EskimoBob_afk> vlaca: I have seen that page multiple times but this is no help
[08:53] <baronos> why the totem in ubuntu without searching youtube? and debian with youtube?
[08:53] <EskimoBob_afk> it's outdated and those pkg are no longer available
[08:53] <histo> vnc786: becuase you missed some dependancies
[08:53] <cjae> histo: right and my folders already have jpeg and mp3 so it wouldnt squish much anyway
[08:53] <histo> vnc786: -d doesn't pull all the depends I believe.  Whya re you trying to do this btw?
[08:54] <cjae> histo: so what is the purpose of tar then?
[08:54] <histo> cjae: Yeah you can get compression on that
[08:54] <histo> cjae: tar is just a container
[08:54] <cjae> histo: and containers dont transfer smoother ?
[08:55] <EskimoBob_afk> cjae: NFS is a joke so what did you expect? faster data transfer than your network can support ? :)
[08:55] <vnc786> histo: all dependencies are there in folder
[08:55] <vnc786> histo: will be installing on multiple pc so...
[08:55] <histo> cjae: Yeah I think your thinking about pointless things. You are bottlenecked by your network. Now if you were transferring a bunch of smaller files you may run into some issues.
[08:55] <cjae> EskimoBob_afk: not at all, not sure how many times ive said smoother not faster
[08:56] <histo> vnc786: use apt-get intall wine   after you pull the depends not dpkg
[08:56] <qualia> is WPS not supported by wpa_supplicant ?
[08:57] <cjae> hmmm
[08:57] <histo> qualia: I don't believe so.
[08:57] <histo> cjae: define smoother?
[08:57] <EskimoBob_afk> FUUUUUUU that xul thingy and *ubuntu!
[08:57] <histo> cjae: risk of data corruption?  If that is your concern then you would be using rsync but you refuse for some reason.
[08:58] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: what are you trying to install that needs it?  also apt-file may be of some help here.
[08:58] <cjae> histo: rsync is fine just exploring other things, I use it for things I cannot afford to lose
[08:58] <histo> cjae: again then I don't know what you mean by smooth on a file transfer.
[08:58] <vnc786> histo: will do that but want to know if all dependcies are there in so can i tell or give source to dpkg command
[08:59] <nibbler> can anyone recommend a nice webgallery that runs fine on ubuntu (server)? i'm overwhelmed by the choices to take: gallery3, coppermine.....
[08:59] <histo> vnc786: apt-get will start downloadign dependancies if they aren't there.
[08:59] <cjae> histo:  5, 20,15, 2 27,2,13 MB/s  is what I would call rough transfer speeds and smooth would bounce between 20-25 MB/s
[08:59] <histo> vnc786: if they are in cache it will use that copy
[09:00] <histo> cjae: so again speed is the issue. When you are transfering smaller files you are going to see a hit like that. If you tar'd you may get more consistent speeds
[09:00] <cjae> histo: ok  thats what I was asking
[09:01] <cjae> well it not to go faster, just stop slowing to point of pausing
[09:01] <baronos> thnx
[09:01] <BillyZane> hi
=== yavor is now known as y4h0
[09:01] <BillyZane> how do i configure openSSH on ubuntu?
[09:01] <vlaca> BillyZane: for what?
[09:01] <erbo> BillyZane: edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config?
[09:01] <nibbler> BillyZane: just install it, and you are done with the basics, check out /etc/sshd for details
[09:01] <histo> cjae: that's from the small files.  You could resolve it with a multi stream transfer. Or making one big file ex: tar or use compression.
[09:01] <histo> !ssh | BillyZane
[09:01] <ubottu> BillyZane: SSH is the Secure SHell protocol, see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH for client usage. PuTTY is an SSH client for Windows; see: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ for it's homepage. See also !scp (Secure CoPy) and !sshd (Secure SHell Daemon)
[09:02] <MonkeyDust> BillyZane  basically: ssh [remote user]@[remote IP]
[09:02] <histo> BillyZane: the server side or the client?
[09:02] <BillyZane> i installed it... i typed man openssh_config
[09:02] <histo> BillyZane: the server config is in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[09:02] <cjae> histo: thanks, I just didnt know how to ask that to google, was hard enough to try to explain what I meant lol
[09:02] <BillyZane> ohh ok...
[09:02] <histo> BillyZane: the user clientside stuff can be put in ~/.ssh
[09:02] <erbo> BillyZane: man sshd_config
[09:02] <nibbler> BillyZane: chance is, you are already done
[09:03] <histo> cjae: tranfer speed or throughput was what you were looking for not smooth
[09:03] <BillyZane> nibbler: first time doing it... now sure how it works
[09:03] <histo> BillyZane: you can ssh localhost   and see if it's answering
[09:04] <BillyZane> nibbler. i installed.... openssh-server
[09:04] <BillyZane> ok i'll try
[09:04] <histo> BillyZane: If you are going to port forward on your router so You can get to this box from the outside world, may I recomend installing fail2ban so you server doesn't get hammered.
[09:04] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: I need to get spice-xpi installed but missing libxul-embedding and searching via google has no usable results
[09:04] <EskimoBob_afk> I have wasted a half a morning on this bs now
[09:04] <BillyZane> it says authenticity of localhost can't be established, ECDSA key fingerprint is .....
[09:04] <BethovenLed> Hello
[09:04] <BillyZane> histo: sure
[09:05] <BethovenLed> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
[09:05] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: Let me do some quick searching
[09:05] <BethovenLed> If I increase my RAMs
[09:05] <histo> BillyZane: you can hit yes to accept
[09:05] <BillyZane> histo: oh btw, this is a virtual box i have it on, lol. i have a ubuntu proper install though
[09:05] <BethovenLed> Ubuntu usually accept how much ?
[09:05] <BillyZane> i suppose virtual box won't really do right?
[09:05] <histo> BillyZane: that's a secuirty measure so that you can know if the host you are connecting to has changed or you arevictim to a man in the middle attack.
[09:06] <histo> BillyZane: no it will.
[09:06] <BethovenLed> Please if anyone can help ?
[09:06] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: thanx
[09:06] <Hannofcart> i just installed nvidia-current-updates (after installing the generic linux headers). lshw -c video lists nvidia as the driver. Yet, on kde, my window decorations are messed up, no panels at top, resolution is downgraded.... what could be wrong/
[09:06] <histo> BethovenLed: 64g b
[09:06] <MonkeyDust> !memory | BethovenLed is this useful
[09:06] <ubottu> BethovenLed is this useful: If you are wondering why some tools report your system has very little free memory, have a look at http://www.linuxatemyram.com/ | A short primer on Linux memory management can be found here: http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/free-mem.html
[09:07] <BillyZane> histo: what's that program called again?
[09:07] <cjae> histo: ya im just trying to wrap head around protocols, since the reported network speed should be about 125 MB/s which is never reached, but to see only 13 Mb/s is hard to understand the overhear there. FTP seems to be about the best at 50 and + somtimes.
[09:07] <BethovenLed> 64 Gb RAM you mean ?
[09:07] <Sajar> is anyone familiar with the symbolic links in the /etc/rc#.d folders and how to configure them on 12.04?
[09:07] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1960416
[09:07] <west333> BethovenLed:  whqt is the issue ther
[09:07] <histo> BillyZane: which program?
[09:08] <west333> something about ram?
[09:08] <histo> BethovenLed: yes
[09:08] <histo> BethovenLed: that's the limit
[09:08] <BillyZane> histo: you said there's an app that protects your ssh server from middle man attacks and such
[09:08] <west333> what OS are you using
[09:08] <BethovenLed> Oh Cool thanks histo
[09:08] <west333>  32 bit or 64 bit
[09:08] <BillyZane> histo: isn't openSSH really secure though? i don't see why i'd even need it, but i guess it's needed
[09:08] <Sajar> me?
[09:08] <histo> BethovenLed: sorry that's with pae 32bit kernel with 64 bit system it's aro9und 1TB
[09:09] <histo> BethovenLed: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/32bit_and_64bit#Memory
[09:09] <BethovenLed> I am using a 32 bits processor so ==> 64 Gb right ?
[09:10] <MonkeyDust> BethovenLed  with PAE
[09:10] <histo> BillyZane: you need fail2ban!!!! It stops brute force attempts on your server. It allows people three tries within so many minutes and then bans their ip for 5 minutes by default.
[09:10] <BethovenLed> What is PAE ?
[09:10] <histo> BillyZane: unless you enable key based logins
[09:10] <histo> BethovenLed: Physical address extension
[09:10] <MonkeyDust> !pae
[09:10] <ubottu> To use more than ~3.2GB RAM on a 32bit system you can install the PAE-enabled kernel. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE for more info
[09:10] <BillyZane> histo: ohhh nice, then they can't use a brute force attack to enter
[09:11] <west333> BethovenLed:  you can figure out  max Q memory  with a calculator    64 bit  is  [2^64th power ] = mem max
[09:11] <histo> BillyZane: right. You wouldn't believe where the attempts come from.  China mostly. I even had a login attempt from an Australian DoD computer that had most likely been comprimised.
[09:11] <Sajar> is anyone familiar with the symbolic links in the /etc/rc#.d folders and how to configure them on 12.04?
[09:12] <histo> west333: but there are other limits on 64bit that bring it down to 1TB
[09:12] <BillyZane> histo: trippy. to think my home computer would be attacked by chinese hackers
[09:12] <west333>  so as the lads in here said  there is also a max file size
[09:12] <histo> !upstart | Sajar
[09:12] <ubottu> Sajar: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[09:12] <zetheroo> is there a command which shows the version of the Intel driver in use?\
[09:12] <west333> yup  histo
[09:12] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: thanx, this was one of the first pages I ended up :) but sorry to say, this will not resolve the problem because xulrunner-1.9.2_1.9.2.28+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1_i386.deb craps out. There are some dependency problems and someone has even filed a bug
[09:12] <histo> BillyZane: yeap.. YOu can run a honeypot if you want to see what they are doing. There are programs like kippo that are fun to play with.
[09:13] <west333>  else off  the max file size is larger tho
[09:13] <west333> contiguous , aka VM
[09:13] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: Yes.. Did you contact the devs of splice-xpi  ??
[09:13] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: and is there another program that you could use possibly?
[09:13] <BillyZane> histo: it's freaking late. i need to sleep, i gotta wake up and stdy too but i need to get this working also, whoe is me. what shoul i do
[09:13] <EskimoBob_afk> my hatred of kubuntu has risen to FUUUU from FUU ... LOL
[09:14] <west333> brb
[09:14] <BillyZane> EskimoBob_afk: i'm getting bored of kubuntu also
[09:14] <somsip> BillyZane: try Fail2Ban if you want to keep them out as soon as they start to do silly stuff
[09:14] <BillyZane> i want a new desktop environment now
[09:14] <Sajar> thank you ubottu. I'll look into it. Will this mean that the rc#.d will be useless?
[09:14] <BillyZane> somsip: ok, i'll try it
[09:14] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: no, I do not have a user in bugs something something page
[09:14] <west333> ..
[09:14] <nibbler> BillyZane: dozends of desktop enviroments are just an apt-get away....
[09:15] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: http://www.ovirt.org/Ovirt_build_on_debian/ubuntu#SPICE  There is deb at the bottom of the page
[09:15] <EskimoBob_afk> i have used gentoo for 10 years so this apt-* sh** is really strange to me :)
[09:15] <nibbler> somsip: i see bruteforcers adapting to fail2ban already, only scanning a few combinations a time and coming back later...
[09:15] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: https://launchpad.net/~gekkio/+archive/spice  is the ppa
[09:16] <west333> BillyZane:  try  the LXDE  insted of KDE ,, just install it , and at login  change session to  lxde
[09:16] <nibbler> EskimoBob_afk: by strange you mean "strangely fast and slick", coming from gentoo, eh?
[09:16] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: oh, let me check that out :) thanx
[09:16] <somsip> nibbler: not really an effective way to crack passwords then is it? It all depends on what limits the server admin wants to set on different logs.
[09:16] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: Yeah you are suffering from dependancy hell right now. Worst case scenario you could build all the dependancies from source by yourself.
[09:16] <BillyZane> west333: that is the one i'm actually looking at
[09:17] <west333> ^5 kiddo ,, its a good DE
[09:17] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: no, life is too short for this
[09:17] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: then I would suggest trying the PPA
[09:17] <histo> !ppa > EskimoBob_afk
[09:17] <ubottu> EskimoBob_afk, please see my private message
[09:17] <EskimoBob_afk> I am going to
[09:17] <nibbler> somsip: highly effective, as it beats fail2ban.... instead of having 100 overtaken hosts scanning one target each, each goes for 3 tries each host, and then to the next target, coming back to the original one 12h later. gives them the same try/second rate over the targeted servers, just without having to worrie about 5m-12h bans via fail2ban
[09:18] <BillyZane> west333: have you tried cinnamonne
[09:18] <EskimoBob_afk> PPA it is, lets see what happens
[09:18] <west333> no thanks
[09:18] <west333>  lol
[09:18] <histo> west333: what is kiddo?
[09:18] <histo> west333: oh nvm...Lol  I thought you were saying kiddo is a good DE
[09:18] <west333> kiddo is a friendly way of saying  buddy
[09:19] <histo> BillyZane: XFCE is nice to. Although lately i've been running Awesome WM. I can't stand using my mouse.
[09:19] <west333> nm ,, np  bo big
[09:19] <west333> no big**
[09:19] <BillyZane> histo, i'll check out XFCE
[09:19] <Sajar> Most people I know would take "Kiddo" as an insult :9
[09:19] <histo> lol
[09:19] <somsip> nibbler: ok - I'd not considered distributed attacks like that. However 5m - 12h bans are configurable. It was a suggestion, not set in stone. YMMV
[09:19] <opalepatrick> using unity with 12.10 - have a problem with launcher and hud/lens disappearing behind browsers other apps etc. Anyone have any ideas?
[09:19] <west333> uggghhh  xfce
[09:19] <west333> nahh
[09:20] <BillyZane> i guess i can try it
[09:20] <west333>  lacky - sphere , no options
=== Adys_ is now known as Adsy
[09:20] <opalepatrick> lol, its an acquired taste
=== Adsy is now known as Adys
[09:20] <fidel> !info avant-window-navigator
[09:20] <ubottu> Package avant-window-navigator does not exist in quantal
[09:20] <histo> nibbler: I'mm not seeing that sort of activity
[09:20] <EskimoBob_afk> fuu, buntu has versions, damn...  so , if i have "precise" and the help uses "snotty" do I just replace the snotty with precise in "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gekkio/spice/ubuntu natty main"
[09:20] <fidel> interesting - it existed until 12.04 then
[09:21] <BillyZane> west333: no?
[09:21] <west333> thats exactly why I went to lxde ,, xfce was a lacky
[09:21] <EskimoBob_afk> oops, it's natty, same difference
[09:21] <west333> try lxde
[09:21] <nibbler> somsip: even if its not distributed, the total attempt/second and final success rate, considering 1000-10000 attempts per host, is easily achivable. i am now banning foreign IPs permanently, and only unban those of my local country....
[09:21] <fidel> what dock-like app would you guys recommend me insteed of AWN then?
[09:21] <BillyZane> west333: i'm using kubuntu atm, is lxde that much better? i kinda like the retro... simple. low quality look. that is to say, no fancy transparencies. i'm sorta use to it on windows 7 though, and my PC is not slow by any means
[09:22] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: Hrm... The PPA is old then if it has references to Natty and no precise.
[09:22] <somsip> nibbler: I'm not interested in a discussion on the merits of Fail2Ban right now. You have some valid points. I don't experience any attacks like that on my server. I'm working now, so EOT for me
[09:22] <apm1> lxde is the plainest desktop one can get
[09:22] <fidel> BillyZane: how about just testing it up?
[09:22] <opalepatrick> west333, I meant unity... been using mint adn like it, but some things are very easy from a workflow pov with unity... testing my patience though :-)
[09:22] <west333> BillyZane:  then you will lik it over xf
[09:22] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: ok :(
[09:22] <fidel> BillyZane: you can simply install xfce and any other environment besides your kde
[09:22] <BillyZane> fidel: for sure.
[09:22] <histo> nibbler: where did you obtain a list of country specific ips?
[09:22] <west333> no unire max Q for ram in a calc BethovenLed:   you can figuty is for faster boxes , not lappys
[09:23] <saruji> Getting error message please re-install "software center", tried to purge and than install, same error
[09:23] <west333> ok that got messed  unity is for higher end boxes ,
[09:23] <saruji> system is 12.10 on a x230t laptop
[09:23] <west333> and dweebs
[09:23] <opalepatrick> where do I go to find unity lovers then #masochism ?
[09:23] <saruji> any ideas or directions?  thank you ahead of time
[09:24] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: hrm.....
[09:24] <west333>  lxde is for lower end / older machines  good on lapppies
[09:24] <apm1> saruji, hows the hardware support on the x230t ?
[09:24] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: there are packages for precise in jason brooks ppa
[09:24] <west333> lxde is the low end kde
[09:24] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: so yes change to precise
[09:25] <nibbler> histo: geoip does help you
[09:25] <BillyZane> quick question.. is xfde a full featured desktop? i don't want to lose functionality
[09:25] <MonkeyDust> BillyZane  try it, to see if you miss something
[09:25] <apm1> BillyZane, it is more than what unity provides :p
[09:25] <wald0> what is the most recent/updated branch of ubuntu ? i have "quantal" and "raring" on my sources.list, and where fits "precise" btw ?
[09:26] <histo> BillyZane: yes xfce is full featured.  There is also xubuntu   which is centered around xfce
[09:26] <BillyZane> ima check that out
[09:26] <histo> !releases | wald0
[09:26] <ubottu> wald0: Ubuntu releases a new version every 6 months. Each version is supported for 18 months to 5 years. More info at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases & http://wiki.ubuntu.com/TimeBasedReleases
[09:26] <MonkeyDust> wald0  precise is an LTS, raring is the future release
[09:26] <histo> BillyZane: you can have multiple DE's installed on one machine also.
[09:26] <saruji> apm1, awesome
[09:26] <histo> BillyZane: you choose what DE you want on the login screen.
[09:27] <wald0> MonkeyDust: what is an lts ?
[09:27] <apm1> long term support releses
[09:27] <cfhowlett> !lts|wald0
[09:27] <ubottu> wald0: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[09:27] <saruji> apm1, literaly just popped in 12.10 with my thumb drive and all is working, using xournal is really nice, cleaner to manage than onenote, really am happy!
[09:27] <BillyZane> i'm presuming xfde is xfdesktop4
[09:27] <MonkeyDust> wald0  long term support, longer support, updates
[09:28] <apm1> saruji, did the fingerprint reader work ?
[09:28] <saruji> apm1, but right now my software center is not working, guess i'll just apt-get everything
[09:28] <saruji> apm1, could not tell you, i did not get it included on the machine
[09:28] <apm1> ok
[09:28] <BillyZane> why does xfde have 3 types of installs... xfdektop4, -data and -dbg, will these all install after i install xfdesktop4 ?
[09:28] <west333> BillyZane:  I have used RH 6~9. fed 3~10, Sue 11.2 and Ubu 10.4~12.04 .... and the lxde DE comes up as a 10 over gnome for attractiveness and way under KDE for resource hog status
[09:29] <criipt> How do I recover my ubuntu password? =(
[09:29] <Onkeltem> Can I upgrade Ubuntu 10.10 to 12.04 if I will boot from 12.04 iso?
[09:29] <criipt> Don't want to reinstall.
[09:29] <saruji> hello, could anyone point me towards a solution to software center missing or being corrupted?
[09:29] <Onkeltem> s/I will/I/
[09:29] <BillyZane> west333: well i guess i'm sold then. i sorta like gnome though, LOL
[09:29] <cfhowlett> Onkeltem, you can clean install but not upgrade
[09:29] <west333> openbox also alows 2 modes   xfce mode  and gnome mode
[09:29] <Onkeltem> cfhowlett: will it preserve my data?
[09:29] <apm1> saruji, try reinstalling unity it'll pull it as a dependency , i hope
[09:29] <west333> BillyZane:  install it , try it
[09:30] <cfhowlett> Onkeltem, if you have a dedicated separate /home and do not format /home
[09:30] <BillyZane> west333: i'm installing xfdesktop4 atm
[09:30] <histo> BillyZane: it's xfce not xfde
[09:30] <west333>  then make notes
[09:30] <saruji> apm1, should i do a purge of unity?
[09:30] <BillyZane> umm... wait
[09:30] <west333> typo
[09:30] <histo> !xfce | BillyZane
[09:30] <ubottu> BillyZane: Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce as the desktop environment. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org/ - To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop » - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
[09:30] <west333>  np
[09:30] <apm1> saruji, no just reinstall via synaptic
[09:30] <BillyZane> i thought xfde was the better one
[09:30] <cjae> criipt: write your password in black permanent marker on something black plastic, eg, back of monitor  hold in light to reveal :p
[09:30] <BillyZane> histo: i'll install xfce also :)
[09:30] <cfhowlett> saruji, I wouldn't.  Just install the DE you want and use that.
[09:30] <MonkeyDust> BillyZane  better is a matter of taste
[09:31] <Onkeltem> cfhowlett: no, I don't have a dedicated partition for /home
[09:31] <histo> BillyZane: there is not xfde package. If you are install xfdesktop4  that is a desktop background and stuff.
[09:31] <saruji> cfhowlett, DE? Differential Equa?
[09:31] <MonkeyDust> saruji  desktop environment
[09:31] <saruji> ok really confused now
[09:31] <histo> saruji: desktop environment
[09:31] <saruji> MonkeyDust, oh
[09:31] <saruji> lol
[09:31] <BillyZane> histo: how do i get it then?
[09:31] <saruji> thanks all
[09:32] <cfhowlett> Onkeltem, then /home will not be preserved and will be overwritten
[09:32] <saruji> cfhowlett, i want the default one that comes with ubuntu desktop
[09:32] <apm1> saruji, i am not sure it'll work 100%
[09:32] <cfhowlett> saruji, Desktop Environment *unity xfce, etc.
[09:32] <histo> BillyZane: sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop  For the complete xubuntu experience.  If you want to go minimal you could just sudo apt-get install xfce4
[09:32] <saruji> apm1, no problem
[09:32] <BillyZane> histo: when i do sudo apt-cache search xfde , i only see 3 results
[09:32] <apm1> its xfce
[09:32] <saruji> cfhowlett, ok so sudo apt-get purge unity?
[09:32] <cfhowlett> saruji, default is unity
[09:32] <saruji> and than install
[09:32] <histo> BillyZane: Right because its' XFCE<<<< Notice the C not a D.
[09:32] <Onkeltem> cfhowlett: heh, even Windows can keep data
[09:32] <apm1> search for xfce4
[09:32] <saruji> from command prompt?
[09:32] <cfhowlett> saruji, I'd suggest you do not purge unity.  Just don't use it.
[09:32] <west333> MonkeyDust:  exactly  so I want billy to install it  and at login , doo a sesion  lxde ad try it
[09:32] <MonkeyDust> saruji  no need and you'll probably ruin yous rystem
[09:33] <MonkeyDust> system*
[09:33] <histo> BillyZane: you keep typing xfde  for some reason.
[09:33] <saruji> ok so how can i reinstall my DE, in order to fix my software center???
[09:33] <west333> good thing my typos dont count  for appearances
[09:33] <BillyZane> ok, i'll try the other desktop...
[09:33] <cfhowlett> Onkeltem, dedicated /home is easy to establish.  set it up, then do your upgrade
[09:33] <BillyZane> so xfce and xfde are all part of xubunutu?
[09:33] <MonkeyDust> saruji  if you don't like unity, install something else, logout, select something else, login
[09:34] <apm1> BillyZane, no xubuntu is a remix of ubuntu +xfce
[09:34] <saruji> MonkeyDust, i like unity, just getting an error when starting ubuntu software
[09:34] <saruji> ...
[09:34] <BillyZane> oh
[09:34] <BillyZane> lol
[09:34] <histo> saruji: what's wrong with your software center?
[09:34] <west333> billy apm1 same old routine  login  sudo apt-get install  lxde
[09:34] <MonkeyDust> saruji  try sudo apt-get install softwarecenter --reinstall
[09:35] <west333> log out ,,,,,, login lxde session
[09:35] <apm1> west333, when did i ask that :p
[09:35] <west333>  mod as you will
[09:35] <histo> BillyZane: lxde is the same way there is lubuntu-desktop  for lxde+ubuntu  Or you can just install these DE's by themselves. The choice is yours.
[09:35] <saruji> MonkeyDust, ok will do
[09:35] <MonkeyDust> saruji  try sudo apt-get install software-center --reinstall
[09:35] <apm1> west333, no i am not asking a question ,i know this stuff :p
[09:35] <west333> k
[09:36] <Onkeltem> cfhowlett: what do you mean - establish? Whole hdd is already partitioned and it has exactly two partitions for "/" & sawp
[09:36] <meet> when installing software through software center, is any .deb file or as such stored anywhere on my computer?
[09:36] <saruji> MonkeyDust, running it now, thanks
[09:36] <apm1> meet, most are stored in your apt cache
[09:36] <west333> I forgot about the name groupings  as I aid , as a noob here  it will take awhile\
[09:37] <histo> meet: /var/cache/apt/archives/
[09:37] <west333> said*
[09:37] <meet> apm1: will i be able to use them for installation on another computer? It has got an internet connection but slow.
[09:37] <dagerik> when I boot there is an error that /tmp was unable to mount. help
[09:37] <apm1> meet, as long as the dependencies are installed too
[09:37] <histo> !apt-mirror | meet
[09:38] <histo> hrm.. what happened to that trigger
[09:38] <apm1> the bot sleeps :p
[09:38] <meet> :D
[09:38] <jang> quick question: using grub2 with ubuntu. In order to work around an mcp55 issue, I need to ensure that every new kernel gets a particular option added to the grub boot line. Is there a file to configure that?
[09:39] <Name141> is there an offical Spotify source now?
[09:39] <Name141> native
[09:39] <west333> lol
[09:39] <BillyZane> i want to try out xfde, not ce
[09:39] <MonkeyDust> <3 "quick questions", they can never be answered
[09:39] <BillyZane> how do i install xfde ?
[09:39] <meet> will everything running on ubuntu run on Zorin OS?
[09:39] <apm1> i have never in my life seen xfde
[09:39] <Name141> xubuntu-desktop
[09:39] <west333> BillyZane:  install both
[09:39] <apos> sudo apt-get install xfce
[09:39] <BillyZane> are you xure? wouldn't that install xubunutu
[09:39] <apos> BillyZane,  sudo apt-get install xfce
[09:40] <BillyZane> xubunutu is a remix of ubuntu and xfce, it's not xfce or xfde
[09:40] <apm1> apos, its apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies (for the noobs ) :p
[09:40] <west333> that way you can try all  xfce and  lxde  and gnome
[09:40] <apos> personally i would recommend sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio
[09:40] <jang> MonkeyDust: perhaps not; /etc/grub.d/10_linux looks dense but also appears to not haul in any config file, which I find hard to believe
[09:40] <BillyZane> west333: it installs all 3 at once?
[09:40] <west333> nope
[09:41] <west333> BillyZane:  you need to sudo apt-get , or lazy like me install from synaptic
[09:41] <BillyZane> xfce is unable to locate
[09:41] <west333> each is seperate
[09:41] <BillyZane> i can't find a proper package
[09:41] <histo> jang: /etc/default/grub
[09:41] <west333> nooo
[09:42] <BillyZane> so i install all the packages
[09:42] <apm1> BillyZane, run this "sudo apt-get install xfce4 xfce4-goodies"
[09:42] <jang> histo: thanks.
[09:42] <histo> !info spotify | Name141
[09:42] <ubottu> Name141: Package spotify does not exist in quantal
[09:42] <west333>  sudo apt-get installl xfce
[09:42] <apm1> xfce4
[09:42] <BillyZane> apm1: working
[09:42] <BillyZane> it's installing
[09:42] <Name141> histo: I'm using 12.04.1
[09:42] <apm1> west333, the package name in the repos is xfce4
[09:42] <west333> &&sudo apt-get install lxde
[09:42] <histo> jang: more specifically the GRUB_CMDLIND_LINUX_DEFAULT  line
[09:42] <Name141> http://www.liberiangeek.net/2012/04/the-quickest-way-to-install-spotify-client-in-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/ doesn't help either
[09:42] <BillyZane> i'll try lxde also
[09:43] <apos> BillyZane,  personally i would recommend sudo apt-get install ubuntustudio-desktop
[09:43] <west333>  yup thats the spin of xfce
[09:43] <Name141> says spotify-client-qt isn't there
[09:43] <histo> Name141: what are you looking for exactly I didn't understand you rquestion
[09:43] <jang> histo: if we're ever co-located, that's earnt you a beer. cheers.
[09:43] <Name141> histo: To get Spotify native
[09:43] <BillyZane> i think this vbox only has about 122gb or so of space
[09:43] <Name141> histo: All though I guess I could just install wine
[09:43] <BillyZane> err.. 12
[09:43] <west333>  its the 4th release  so thats  the one you want
[09:43] <histo> Name141: Oh it's a windows app
[09:43] <Name141> histo: I thought they ported it
[09:43] <west333> synaptic is soooo much easie
[09:43] <apos> Ubuntu Studio runs xfce n out of the box is a really awedome system
[09:44] <west333> r
[09:44] <apos> awesome*
[09:44] <histo> Name141: http://www.spotify.com/us/blog/archives/2010/07/12/linux/
[09:44] <apm1> apos, ubuntu studio also pulls a lot of MM apps he'll never use
[09:44] <histo> Name141: Google is your friend btw
[09:44] <BillyZane> i gotta sleep
[09:45] <apos> or will he?
[09:45] <BillyZane> thanks everyone.. wait wait i'll testout the new OS
[09:45] <BillyZane> err environment
[09:45] <apm1> apos, idts
[09:45] <apm1> did he say he's an artist kind
[09:45] <histo> apos: why would he install that?   H ejust wants to check out xfce
[09:45] <west333> histo ypu yup  google is
[09:45] <apm1> xfce4 and xfce4-goodies was the way to go
[09:46] <apm1> thus he did install it :)
[09:46] <apos> probably like 80% of em, plus the rest being there ready to open any kind of file he'll ever get his hands on for the most part
[09:46] <BillyZane> ok i'm in xfce
[09:46] <west333> lol
[09:46] <Name141> histo: not google images anymore
[09:46] <apm1> BillyZane, do thank me in the future when you'll be a *nixer and xfce die hard :p
[09:46] <BillyZane> ooo.. i like it
[09:46] <west333> ok , nw log out of xfce  do a sesion change  to lxde and login
[09:47] <BillyZane> it's kinda cool. i just hate the mac menu bar on the bottom
[09:47] <BillyZane> hmm.. i gotta install lxde right
[09:47] <apm1> its a panel not a dock
[09:47] <apos> you can move it change it or get rid of it
[09:47] <BillyZane> is it lxde4 ?
[09:47] <west333> ok  ya  that helps lol
[09:47] <histo> BillyZane: right click on the panel on the bottom and remove it
[09:47] <west333> apt-get  gets the current  spin
[09:47] <BillyZane> oh so nice, i have 4 desktops :D
[09:48] <histo> BillyZane: lxde
[09:48] <BillyZane> OMG so much better than kubuntu
[09:48] <BillyZane> i don't know why, but i lik eit
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest18492
[09:48] <apm1> BillyZane, you can increase the number of those desktops
[09:48] <BillyZane> oh snap
[09:48] <antonio_> hey folks
[09:48] <antonio_> anyone here good with kdenlive?
[09:48] <EskimoBob_afk> histo: you are the man! https://launchpad.net/~gekkio/+archive/spice  worked and there is no need to replace "natty" in "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/gekkio/spice/ubuntu natty main " and deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/gekkio/spice/ubuntu natty main
[09:48] <histo> BillyZane: There are tons of DE's  Like I say you should just youtube like unity lxde xfce awesome wm    etc....
[09:49] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: You should replace natty with precise in your sources.list
[09:49] <BillyZane> awesome wm.... hmm, i'll check that out
[09:49] <histo> EskimoBob_afk: could cause issues in the future. And they have precise packages in that ppa.
[09:49] <apm1> BillyZane, awesome wm is for experienced users
[09:49] <apos> i made mine smaller and put it on the left side of the screen
[09:49] <apos> xfce is nice
[09:49] <apos> better than unity
[09:49] <apm1> it is a tiling wm
[09:49] <BillyZane> awesome WM  looks like a non-mouse based system
[09:49] <Name141> histo: well that worked
[09:50] <apos> antonio_,  i havent used kdenlive much. mostly just openshot
[09:50] <BillyZane> apm1: i am not experienced. so i'll pass for now
[09:50] <BillyZane> what is the package name for lxde?
[09:50] <BillyZane> is it lxde-desktop
[09:50] <BillyZane> ?
[09:50] <MonkeyDust> find lxde
[09:50] <MonkeyDust> !find lxde
[09:50] <ubottu> Found: lxde, lxde-common, lxde-core, lxde-icon-theme
[09:50] <BillyZane> k
[09:51] <apos> sudo apt-get install lxde
[09:51] <BillyZane> i guess it's common ?
[09:51] <apm1> BillyZane, run "sudo apt-get install lxde"
[09:51] <west333> lxde is openbox . which is an evoluttion of blackbox  wm  so its going to be better than xfce
[09:51] <BillyZane> k
[09:51] <somsip> !info lubunut-desktop
[09:51] <ubottu> Package lubunut-desktop does not exist in quantal
[09:51] <histo> BillyZane: Here's my awesome wm desktop http://imagebin.org/244029
[09:51] <somsip> !info lubuntu-desktop
[09:51] <ubottu> lubuntu-desktop (source: lubuntu-meta): Lubuntu Desktop environment. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.45 (quantal), package size 2 kB, installed size 30 kB (Only available for i386; amd64; powerpc; ia64; sparc; lpia; armel; armhf)
[09:51] <Name141> I assume he doesn't want to just install lubuntu-desktop with everything ?
[09:51] <Name141> oh
[09:51] <BillyZane> k, it's installing
[09:51] <histo> I just through up cmatrix for the lulz
[09:51] <apos> ur gonna run out of drive space installing all these window managers if you only have 12gb
[09:52] <antonio_> apos: my main thing is, I don't know what profile I should use for a youtube video..so there are no black bars, etc.
[09:52] <BillyZane> i dunno why i'm getting this now, i like this desktop a lot, but it doesn't hurt to try
[09:52] <somsip> histo: use your screens! (12 here, 10 in use...)
[09:52] <BillyZane> oh! big question...
[09:52] <BillyZane> what's a good irc program, i hate kvirc
[09:52] <apos> i dont like the look and feel of lxde as much as xfce
[09:52] <histo> somsip: Nah I like splits I have a wide lappy monitor
[09:52] <antonio_> billyzane: I use xchat...never done me wrong
[09:52] <BillyZane> i agree, xfce is nice
[09:53] <BillyZane> antonio, i'll give it a try
[09:53] <apm1> xfce is the best since the dawn of it
[09:53] <apos> xchat is nice
[09:53] <BillyZane> xchat installed
[09:53] <antonio_> fast :D
[09:53] <apm1> xchat+1
[09:53] <BillyZane> ok, i'm gona switch to lxde
[09:53] <Name141> Oh yeah, will there be any support for the 4670 in the next LTS, or is 12.04 the end of the line for the AMD non-free drivers all together ?
[09:53] <histo> somsip: Not really splits but tiling. What's thepoint of a tiling manager if you are going t use 12 screens?
[09:53] <antonio_> I love ubuntu..don't really like the video editing programs though
[09:54] <apm1> i am a debian refugee
[09:54] <histo> antonio_: yeah linux video editing has some issues right now.
[09:54] <EskimoBob_afk> joke of the day! : RHEL webbased admin interface error message "Please open this page using Internet Explorer Version 7 and above on a Windows machine."
[09:54] <EskimoBob_afk> LOL!
[09:54] <EskimoBob_afk> IE 7?
[09:54] <BillyZane> wow lxde loaded fast
[09:54] <histo> apm1: weechat or irssi here depending on my mood.
[09:54] <antonio_> so far kdenlive hasn't crashed yet
[09:54] <histo> BillyZane: lxde is really slim on resources
[09:54] <histo> BillyZane: there are even lighter DE's
[09:54] <somsip> histo: becuase I have 16 things running, so I don't have to minimise anything. Some share screens, some (IDEs) are fullscreen. That's much of the point of awesome, I believe
[09:54] <apm1> histo, i can't cope with text files for configs :)
[09:54] <BillyZane> i think my bios uses more resources than this
[09:54] <dagerik> how do I get internet connectivity in the rescue shell? ifconfig only shows the lo interface.
[09:55] <somsip> histo: but each tot heir own. no wrong way
[09:55] <BillyZane> it's nice. i gotta agree, it's nice. but xfce hits a sweet spot
[09:55] <west333> somsip:  yea way back when , i had a girl on each i a skimpy swim suit too... now its down to 2 desk tops
[09:55] <antonio_> Anyone in here decent with video editing?
[09:55] <histo> somsip: No tiling is the point. You can run virtual desktops in pretty much every DE
[09:55] <histo> somsip: true
[09:55] <apm1> BillyZane, welcome to *nix :)
[09:55] <bianca> whats the difference between ubuntu and kubuntu
[09:56] <west333>  right click / advanced
[09:56] <apm1> ubuntu has unity and kubuntu has kde
[09:56] <MonkeyDust> bianca  gnome vs kde
[09:56] <histo> bianca: ubuntu uses unity as the desktop environment while kubuntu uses kde
[09:56] <west333> BillyZane:  right click
[09:56] <west333> advanced
[09:56] <bianca> oh..
[09:56] <west333>  check mark the box

[09:56] <west333>  then you have the xfce style
[09:57] <BillyZane2> wow, this is nice
=== ryanclancy000 is now known as Guest96451
[09:57] <BillyZane2> xchat that is
[09:57] <Guest0518> Hello!
[09:57] <penzur> why does unity suck?
[09:58] <histo> BillyZane2: That's the beauty of linux. You can mess around change everything and there is about 100 ways to do the same task. You have to pick which is best for you.
[09:58] <penzur> is there a way to use xfce as a default desktop env?
[09:58] <somsip> histo: I'm intrigued. How do you maximise previously minimised apps using only keys if you don't use screens? dO you really run everything on one screen?
[09:58] <histo> penzur: yes
[09:58] <histo> penzur: just install xfce and select it at the login screen instead of unity
[09:58] <BillyZane2> histo, you are so right about that. OMG SPELL CHECK!!!!!! I need this so bad
[09:58] <Guest0518> /part
[09:58] <histo> somsip: yes
[09:58] <penzur> thanks histo!
[09:58] <somsip> histo: how do you maxmimise with only keys?
[09:59] <histo> somsip: meta+w
[09:59] <histo> somsip: sorry meta+f
[09:59] <somsip> histo: you have everything full screen and tab around them all?
[09:59] <west333> penzur:  no ,,,, on faer new machines , its faster than light ,, but the issue is the  method()  of it all , contradicts common thought
[10:00] <west333> fear = newer*
[10:00] <histo> somsip: No I have them tiled just like in that screenshot
[10:00] <penzur> what do you mean by method()?
[10:00] <histo> somsip: meta+spacebar will switch between tiling methods
[10:01] <somsip> histo: private as it's OT?
[10:01] <histo> somsip: I also use vimium plugin in chrome. So I have vim keybindings for my web browser. I never touch the mouse er... touchpad in this case.
[10:01] <histo> somsip: sure
[10:01] <west333> its a 'rag on" programming methods .
[10:01] <BillyZane2> histo, west33, apm1: thanks for all the help, i really appreciate it. I gotta sleep, but i'll keep at it. I'm liking *nix more everyday
[10:01] <apm1> BillyZane, :)
[10:02] <west333> penzur:  it means that method is an emty set
[10:02] <west333> empty*
[10:02] <bianca> I think linux sucks because i hate the whole surface thing, that they got rid of the start menu, and am always getting fuckin viruses, and random crashes... oh wait thats windows :P

[10:03] <MonkeyDust> bianca  mind your language
[10:03] <BillyZane2> on a side note, i really need to get a dedicated linux box up and running here.. sigh
[10:03] <BillyZane2> umm.. ok good night
[10:04] <niners> So I just started Ubunu... don't know a whole lot about it... Not the most tech savvy guy in the world but I know my way around a computer about as good as most and Lenix is just a bit confusing... please help
[10:05] <speek_o_guru> !OT | niners
[10:05] <MonkeyDust> niners  start with a question
[10:05] <ubottu> niners: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[10:05] <bianca> theres lots of tutorials on youtube and such that can help you, im new too :)
[10:06] <niners> Bianca. How new are you to it? What are probems you've run into
[10:06] <niners> *problems
[10:07] <antonio_> argh!
[10:07] <MonkeyDust> niners  better get used to the system, then come back if you have a specific question
[10:07] <antonio_> damn kdenlive keeps on crashing...Why can't any linux video editing programs just work?
=== JoFo_ is now known as JoFo
[10:08] <auronandace> antonio_: i like openshot
[10:08] <niners> Thanks Monkey Dust... Well here's a question... why do I have to use a windows emulator (wine) in order to use Netflix?
[10:08] <MonkeyDust> niners  because there's no native linux client
[10:08] <niners> and that means what?
[10:09] <MonkeyDust> niners  netflix for linux does not exist, because the netflix guys didn't create one
[10:09] <auronandace> niners: wine is not an emulator
[10:09] <niners> what is it then?
[10:09] <MonkeyDust> niners  it's a layer
[10:09] <niners> I was under the impression that is is
[10:09] <west333> BillyZane2:  so how di d you make out with th new DE
[10:10] <auronandace> niners: a compatibility layer
[10:10] <auronandace> niners: an emulator is software that pretends to be hardware, wine doesn't do that
[10:10] <niners> well what does that mean in laymen terms... I'm a hardware guy not software
[10:10] <niners> oh
[10:10] <XtremeWiz> Is it possible to view my password if I have administrator privileges?
[10:10] <niners> what does it do then if not that?
[10:11] <west333> ha et  wine ,  it should all be Xen
[10:11] <auronandace> niners: it implements the windows apis on other operating systems
[10:11] <Myrtti> XtremeWiz: not in cleartext
[10:11] <niners> such as lenix
[10:11] <MonkeyDust> niners  linux
[10:11] <west333> afk  brb
[10:11] <niners> okay. cool
[10:11] <niners> Thanks
[10:11] <niners> well goodnight
[10:12] <XtremeWiz> Myrtti: Thanks. How do i reset my password then?
[10:12] <XtremeWiz> I forgot it. But I can login because it's not asking for a password.
[10:13] <Myrtti> XtremeWiz: passwd username
[10:14] <elfer> thats what she said

[10:16] <XtremeWiz> Myrtti: It says You may not view or modify password information for myusername

[10:18] <Hanumaan> how to start mysql in ubuntu 12.10 ?
[10:18] <lukas123> Hello. For testing purpose I would like to install a very recent version of inkscape without mixing up my system. Is this possible? What term do I have to search for?
[10:18] <XtremeWiz> Hanumaan: try "/etc/init.d/mysql.server start"
[10:19] <histo> Hanumaan: it should be started if you installed mysql server
[10:19] <histo> lukas123: what do you mean installing it from source rather than the software center?
[10:20] <mr0wl> what is the difference between "fglrx-amdcccle" and "fglrx-amdcccle-updates?"
[10:20] <XtremeWiz> well, I reset my password, but when I tried to login, it says "the password you use to login no longer matches your login keyring... :/
[10:20] <lukas123> histo, from source is okay. I want to keep the version from software center clean and just try the source version for some days.
[10:20] <histo> !checkinstall | lukas123
[10:20] <ubottu> lukas123: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall - Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page, and DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[10:21] <west333> lukas123:  you cou;d start by telling the room which spin you are on  and if it's just a  matter of upgrades  try sudo apt-get upgrade  inskape
[10:22] <lukas123> histo, great. I will read the documentation.
[10:22] <MoL0ToV> hi to all! i see that latest xubuntu need more or 4GB to install. I have a asus eeepc with 4GB ssd internal disk. what are the latest version that fit in 4GB? leaving some space also to store some document or mp3..
[10:22] <Nova> hello?
[10:22] <west333> inkskape^
[10:22] <histo> XtremeWiz: go to Passwords and Encryption keys and put your new password in there also.
[10:23] <lukas123> west333, I would like to try http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/SymbolsDialog which is not in the repository-version. Thus I this histo's answer is a good solution.
[10:23] <Hanumaan> histo, I think you figured out my problem .. got it thanks
[10:24] <histo> lukas123: yeah always use checkinstall when compiling from source. Then you can easily remov ethe compiled deb.
[10:25] <west333> lukas123:  you are free to try and do as you wish ,,,, but sourse code is alwlays a  stained golden peak ,,, you do so with no  back up
[10:25] <purplerain> !minimal | MoL0ToV
[10:25] <ubottu> MoL0ToV: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[10:25] <histo> west333: that's why you use checkinstall
[10:26] <dagerik> I get this error "the boot the disk drive for /tmp is not ready yet or not present". I have tried all suggestions from google results. Help
[10:26] <west333>  try it    ./ configure  , make clean , make ,  strip , sudo make install
[10:26] <histo> !lubuntu | MoL0ToV
[10:26] <ubottu> MoL0ToV: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[10:26] <histo> dagerik: when do you get there arrer?
[10:27] <histo> west333: no ./configure make checkinstall    <---
[10:27] <dagerik> histo: It's right after boot I get this error message.
[10:27] <lukas123> west333, That is right. I am just curious what is going to be released in the near future.
[10:27] <histo> dagerik: do you have /tmp set to mount on a different drive?
[10:27] <dagerik> histo: no, i think it's mapped to ram
[10:28] <histo> dagerik: why?
[10:28] <histo> dagerik: please pastebin your /etc/fstab
[10:28] <west333>  ya , but strip . cleans out extras after init chech  not debug
[10:28] <west333> else  heavy install
[10:28] <dagerik> histo: it's a default ubuntu install, i dont know how it works
[10:28] <histo> west333: checkinstall creates a deb that you can easily install and remove.
[10:29] <west333> kk
[10:29] <dagerik> histo: im unable to pastebin, but there are no entries for /tmp
[10:29] <histo> dagerik: hrm.. Well that's an issue what sort of disk do you have?
[10:30] <XtremeWiz> histo: I went to "Passwords and Keys" but I couldn't find anything there. I can add a new password keyring. Is that what you meant?
[10:30] <onborad> I use ubuntu core install xorg and xterm ,chroot in rootfs ,start xorg by myself  lead display blackscreen , couldn't switch virtual terminal .and no error report  any one ideas?
[10:30] <histo> XtremeWiz: Hold on let me take a look...
[10:31] <dagerik> histo: i have a regular magnetic disk
[10:31] <dagerik> histo: this problem 'the disk drive for /tmp is not ready yet or not present' occurred after a large dist-upgrade and reboot
[10:32] <histo> dagerik: well does /tmp exist now that the system is up and running?

[10:38] <LIDH> Hello, anyone to help me to get Touch working on ubuntu 12.10?
[10:38] <histo> XtremeWiz: you can try deleting the keyring files from the /home/username/.gnome2 folder
[10:38] <dagerik> histo: /tmp exists and has files.
[10:38] <histo> XtremeWiz: then reboot and login it should tell you to choose a new password for the keyring.
[10:39] <dagerik> histo: dist-upgrade worked fine. but after reboot came this error

[10:40] <histo> dagerik: did you make a post on the forums?
[10:41] <histo> dagerik: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2107725  ?? is that yours?
[10:41] <dagerik> histo: no
[10:41] <fidel> heroandtn3: could you try to rephrase your question?
[10:41] <heroandtn3> I have checked /etc/fstab but nothing about Windows partition in that file
[10:41] <histo> dagerik: you may want to post there that you are experiencing the same issue
[10:41] <dagerik> histo: if i skip mounting, the system runs, but it can be very slow.
[10:41] <dagerik> e.g. it takes 10 seconds for the mount command to exit
[10:42] <heroandtn3> sorry, my English is not good. I'm Vietnamese
[10:42] <histo> heroandtn3: it doesn't save the info... What do you mean where does it mount it when you double click it?

[10:42] <histo> Ben64: he said it's a default install I found someone that just posted on the forums with the same issue.
[10:43] <Ben64> histo: but fstab holds the key
[10:44] <dagerik> histo, Ben64; tabbing in bash hangs for 10 seconds. maybe this indicates something
[10:44] <dagerik> pasting fstab soon...
[10:44] <histo> Onkeltem: I don't know of a way

[10:47] <zetheroo> copying large files to USB stick is very slow ... copying a 3GB file takes 20min ... why is this?
[10:48] <Ben64> dagerik: well thats weird... if i had to guess, i'd say your hard drive has problems, or the cable, or the motherboard, or a combination of those
[10:48] <Onkeltem> histo: true, but there are talks about read-edid utilty, though I haven't tried it
[10:48] <Ben64> zetheroo: flash drives are almost always slow
=== Guest55355 is now known as tzarc
[10:49] <histo> Onkeltem: just out of curiosity why would you need to do that?
=== tzarc is now known as Guest39740
[10:49] <dagerik> Ben64: the drive is on /dev/sda at 320 GB. i think it's a regular magnetic disk
[10:49] <zetheroo> Ben64: not this slow ... the same file copying to the same USB stick on the same PC in the same USB port ... but in Windows ... is much faster
[10:50] <zetheroo> Ben64: this file copies in about 8 min in Windows
[10:50] <Ben64> zetheroo: is it ntfs?
[10:50] <zetheroo> Ben64: FAT
[10:50] <riply> zetheroo, my ubuntu dtop also takes forever to copy to USB even if it's USB3..
[10:50] <Ben64> well then maybe your timing is off
[10:50] <Ben64> do a benchmark on both OS's to be sure about speeds
[10:51] <zetheroo> riply: yes, I have had this issue for a long time now ... but never got around to trying to sort it out
[10:51] <riply> zetheroo, try ext4 if you're only using it in ubuntu of ntfs if winblows too
[10:51] <ikonia> your usb controller may have weaker support in linux than windows
[10:51] <histo> Ben64: No same issue here with usb but i'm thinking its an issue with fat for some reason. I have yet to test it though with other FS types
[10:51] <Ben64> fat32 is just as fast as windows
[10:51] <Onkeltem> histo: hehe, trivial: my mother liked my monitors and asked me to purchase the same for her. I've come to her but forgot to look at my models :)
[10:51] <ikonia> riply: it's called "windows" - if you want serious help, treat it respectfully
[10:51] <Ben64> ntfs is slow, especially when the partition gets more full
[10:51] <riply> zetheroo, ye, it's annoying. In fact, to further increase the frustration, after it says that it's done - it is in fact not. If I try to safely remove it, it says that it's busy and I have to wait a while longer too.
[10:51] <histo> ikonia: lol
[10:51] <zetheroo> ikonia: wow really?
[10:52] <riply> ikonia, seriously?
[10:52] <zetheroo> riply: yes, I have had that happen too
[10:52] <riply> ikonia, I don't want help, I was just saying that I suffer a similar issue. I'm not phased by it.
[10:52] <Onkeltem> histo: and have only ssh to my superb PC harverster with 3 monitors :)
[10:52] <ikonia> if you can't use the proper names of software/tools - then don't bother discussing it
[10:52] <histo> I've experienced the same usb speed issue on multiple machines.
[10:53] <histo> That's why I think its filesystem related or something else going on .
[10:53] <Ben64> maybe i'm just lucky then. I get ~40MB/s over usb2.0 to a fat32 partition
[10:53] <ikonia> Ben64: I don't think so, I get a similar experience as you
[10:53] <riply> ikonia, I don't like Windows. I don't like that they stole the OS. I don't like that they capitalised off of the world. I don't like that they 'innovate' by stealing. I will call the OS WinBLOWS if I like.
[10:53] <histo> Ben64: Yeah I could never touch that.
[10:54] <Ben64> but it's not a flash drive, its a hdd with a usb adapter
[10:54] <ikonia> Ben64: similar here, but I do get a reasonable match to windows performance with usb stick's too
[10:54] <histo> Ben64: riply I experience it alsow with usb enclosure or flash drive.  But like I say it's rare that I use them.
[10:54] <Ben64> trying an ntfs partition, speeds drop to ~20MB/s if I have my cpu on "performance"
[10:54] <ikonia> Ben64: but the overhead of fuse stick in then too
[10:55] <ikonia> although that would be quite a large overhead
[10:55] <histo> I could do some testing now. Is there a way to calculate the rate of transfer in cli?
[10:55] <ikonia> (%50 drop)
[10:55] <Ben64> if only more things supported ext4 :(
[10:55] <dr_willis> most of my htpc media boxs support ext4. ;-)
[10:56] <Ben64> my raspberry pi does, my blu ray player and tv do not
[10:56] <dr_willis> i setup a dlna server on my pi. for my tv.

[11:19] <Jojo_> the var/www/index.php file...can't edit the content
[11:19] <huttan> Jojo_: To change permissions of a file you do: chmod permission file
[11:20] <Jojo_> huttan: like "sudo chmod permission file" ?
[11:20] <huttan> Jojo_: yeah but if ur workin in that folder u prolly wanna do it recursive
[11:20] <histo> Jojo_: There are several ways. You could chmod the file. or chown the file changing the owner or create a group that you are a member of and give that group permissions to the file.
[11:21] <Jojo_> huttan: ok will do, thanks.. i'll post again :)
[11:21] <histo> Jojo_: yeah chmod can use octal or you can use u=user g=group o=world   r=read w=write x=execute so chmod o+w   would allow the world to write to it.

[12:08] <ubottu> famax8: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[12:08] <famax8> yesterday i installed studio 12.10
[12:08] <cfhowlett> famax8, preferably with details
[12:09] <famax8> ok ok
[12:11] <famax8> lets see, i have a preinstalled win 7 ultimate - and yesterday i installed in dual boot ubuntu studio 12.10, it ran smoothly but when i restarted no way to see the OS nor to boot on it fron the hard drive - is a desktop and it has a specific hard drive for linux and i would like to safely install it without having to use the windows cd because is no cd actaully and i do no have the hardware to burn the one provided with one of my mac
[12:11] <MonkeyDust> famax8  tip: there's also #ubuntustudio, but it's not as busy as this channel
[12:11] <famax8> as such
[12:11] <famax8> oh is it one specific for studio?
[12:11] <famax8> thanks
[12:12] <cfhowlett> famax8, no cd?  make a USB
[12:12] <famax8> i dont mind busy or not i mind a good tutorial and so on ^^ becasue this is my issue, no godo tutorial and i polished my retian online!!
[12:12] <famax8> nope no cd and no burner..? :/ yeah well free hardware alrite :)
[12:12] <cfhowlett> famax8, you can boot from USB
[12:13] <famax8> so, shall reinstall but via windows or by booting my usb stick? which option shall i choose to be sure a dual boot is created?
[12:13] <famax8> for linux yes but for windows no so i can not repair if needed
[12:13] <cfhowlett> famax8, wait, you used the windows installer?  wubi?
[12:13] <histo> !grub2 | famax8
[12:13] <ubottu> famax8: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[12:14] <famax8> no the first isntall yesterday was via booting on usb stick sorry i forgot to mention
[12:14] <histo> famax8: and now you cant' see ubuntu or can't see windows?
[12:14] <famax8> windows was fine couldnt see ubuntu
[12:14]  * val_ coucou
[12:14] <famax8> coucou
[12:14] <famax8> ??
[12:14] <histo> famax8:follow the link from ubottu for fixing grub
[12:14] <val_> ca va ?
[12:15] <famax8> and thus even if windows startup is destroyed it will fix it?
[12:15] <cfhowlett> famax8, ubuntu rewrites the master boot record.  Not sure exactly how this works on UEFI ... to fix windows you need to boot the windows disk and repair.
[12:16] <histo> famax8: why is windows startup destroyed now?
[12:16] <histo> famax8: do you have a system that uses uefi?
[12:16] <histo> !uefi | famax8
[12:16] <ubottu> famax8: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[12:16] <famax8> is not destroyed... yet... -__-
[12:17] <famax8> but i prefer be safe than sorry as i dont have windows cd
[12:17] <histo> famax8: I'm so confused can you restate your question with more clarity
[12:17] <famax8> and uefi??
[12:17] <famax8> u mean the "dos"?
[12:17] <histo> !details | famax8
[12:17] <ubottu> famax8: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[12:17] <famax8> i know mac's efi but Uefi
[12:17] <famax8> again?
[12:17] <famax8> ok
[12:17] <famax8> lets make it simple
[12:17] <histo> famax8: Yeah because it didn't make any sense the first time
[12:18] <histo> !enter | famax8
[12:18] <ubottu> famax8: Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!

[12:21] <MonkeyDust> famax8  so a plain dual boot?
[12:21] <cfhowlett> famax8, install virtualbox into windows, put US in the vbox
[12:21] <famax8> yes
[12:21] <histo> cfhowlett: that's not dual booting
[12:21] <famax8> but that wont gimme full access
[12:22] <histo> famax8: then you put the ubuntu install cd in  and install
[12:22] <MonkeyDust> !dualboot | famax8

[12:22] <cfhowlett> histo, true, but given the issues, he's raised, it puts his system at minimal risk
[12:23] <famax8> well ok i tried ot install via windows yesterday but couldnt see the US at restart and i wasnt even given the option
[12:23] <famax8> i followed a tutorial i found here (thas how i found the chat)
[12:23] <histo> famax8: because grub didn't get installed properly
[12:23] <famax8> ah no different machien sorry

[12:25] <varun__> MonkeyDust: I already have that and have done that. I have emacs versoin 23 and need 24
[12:25] <varun__> :(
[12:25] <varun__> how to ??
[12:25] <varun__> do that ?
[12:25] <c00kee> samba is freaking me out , it is neccessary to use the terminal when configuring samba
[12:25] <c00kee> on ubuntu
[12:25] <adamk> varun__: apt-get install emacs24
[12:26] <varun__> but dont I have to add repos. I am on lucid lynx onlly :)
[12:26] <famax8> cfhowlett: is on a pc desktop
[12:26] <cfhowlett> famax8, got it.
[12:27] <OerHeks> !emacs
[12:27] <MonkeyDust> varun__  if it's not in the repos, you need a PPA or so, but that's not supported, use it at your own risk

[12:27] <OerHeks> version 45
[12:27] <cfhowlett> famax8, I dual boot win7 and US.  I'd say boot the ubuntu CD and you'll probably find that your ubuntu files did indeed install.  If so, reinstall grub and you should be flying.
[12:27] <histo> What is emacs 64
[12:28] <moritz_89> Hey Guys. Want to help me with online voting? sry for asking here but im ubuntu user, so know this channel and u r 1700 peaople in here ^^
[12:28] <Ben64> moritz_89: no

Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[12:28] <OerHeks> moritz_89, no voting/polling here please
[12:28] <histo> c00kee: no I think there is a samba gui now

[12:28] <Ben64> pretty sure thats against the guidelines
[12:28] <moritz_89> ok so do like never asked xD
[12:28] <famax8> cfhowlett: so via usb is fine too? what if it fail to install the grub well again?
[12:29] <histo> c00kee: you can even administer it via the web with swat
[12:29] <moritz_89> sry^^
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
[12:29] <histo> famax8: Does this computer have a recovery partition?
[12:29] <Ben64> moritz_89: not a problem, but if we start letting one person, then 1800 people will be here doing it :)
[12:29] <famax8> not at all
[12:29] <cfhowlett> famax8, so far as ubuntu is concerned, there's no difference between booting cd or usb.  If grub fails again, we have to problem solve it's failing.
[12:29] <histo> famax8: who made it?
[12:30] <moritz_89> Ben64: thats true ^^
[12:30] <famax8> histo : made the machine?
[12:31] <histo> famax8: Who is the manufacturer/builder of the computer does it have a make/model???
[12:31] <c00kee> swat???
[12:31] <histo> !samba | c00kee
[12:31] <ubottu> c00kee: Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
[12:31] <famax8> histo: not at all is full of different parts form here and there
[12:31] <histo> famax8: Okay then why do you not have a windows cd?
[12:31] <famax8> has been given without -__-
[12:32] <famax8> and no burner to burn a new one
[12:32] <histo> c00kee: there are other guis to. I'm sure you can find one if you search the software center for samba
[12:33] <histo> famax8: well at the very least backup your data. You could also use something like clonezilla to backup your current partition to some external storage.
[12:33] <cfhowlett> famax8, do you have the windows 25 digit verification code on that machine?  you can DL a legal win iso, from ****soft
[12:33] <famax8> i was thinking of this actually just now clonezilla will do an image and i can reinstall then
[12:33] <famax8> but i cant burn it!!!
[12:33] <famax8> :'(
[12:33] <c00kee> right, and i did configure it using with gui, but most tutorials direct me to opening the terminal and modifying /etc/samba/smb.conf
[12:33] <famax8> i have the program already but no way to burn a cd
[12:34] <MonkeyDust> famax8  sounds like a limited custom-built pc
[12:34] <famax8> anyway it wont ruin my windows just the guerub right?
[12:34] <cfhowlett> famax8, windows has a usb boot creator as well.  look it up.
[12:34] <famax8> monkeydust: hahaha yes this is a nice way to put it
[12:35] <famax8> needs at least 8gb usb stick for windows
[12:35] <cfhowlett> famax8, won't touch windows unless you tell it too.  partition carefully.
[12:35] <famax8> i got 4gb
[12:35] <famax8> no need for partition is a separate hard drive dedicated to it only
[12:36] <dr_willis> you do mean 2 real hard drives.. not one drive with differnt 'letters/partions' ;)
[12:36] <dr_willis> if so.. be sure you are booting the HD that has grub on it.
[12:37] <famax8> yes to physical hard drives
[12:37] <famax8> would that be the problem then? that i dont see US once i reboot after install as it happened yesterday?
[12:37] <cfhowlett> famax8, make sure you install grub to the right spot.
[12:37] <famax8> the HD with US right?
[12:38] <cfhowlett> famax8, not necessarily.  consult your tutorial.  grub can be installed anywhere
[12:38] <histo> famax8: clonezilla to another hdd
[12:38] <famax8> ok
[12:38] <famax8> and what would you recommend then?

[12:53] <ThinkT510> raddy_: avoid wubi
[12:54] <raddy_> I don't want to use usb drive or cd / dvdr
[12:54] <MonkeyDust> ThinkT510  don't even mention the name
[12:54] <ThinkT510> raddy_: then use a usb

[13:00] <erupter> hi guys, I have a problem with a file's permission. it's a usb tty and it gets reset on reboot. I need it to stick. How can I do that?
[13:01] <histo> erupter: what?
[13:01] <histo> !botabuse > yak_king
[13:01] <ubottu> yak_king, please see my private message
[13:01] <erupter> histo, sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0
[13:01] <erupter> it doesn't stick on reboot
[13:02] <dr_willis> Hmm.. i imagine it would reset if you unplyg/replug back in the device also erupter
[13:02] <histo> erupter: You are trying to change permisions on a device you relize that right
[13:02] <erupter> histo absolutely
[13:02] <dr_willis> erupter:  the proper way may be a udev rule (i think) if you want to tweak it.  q why do you need to set the permissions on it?
[13:02] <yak_king> hot it histo.... thanks sorry... I reallly WAS looking for info LOL but didn't think about the bot being able to do it in pvm... sorry... and thanks : ()
[13:03] <erupter> dr_willis, because I need user programs to access it
[13:03] <dr_willis> erupter:  a dirty work around would be put the command in /etc/rc.local
[13:03] <histo> erupter: okay well you'd have to write a udev rule that sets the permisions properly
[13:03] <dr_willis> udev rule would be the proper way. ;)

[13:04] <histo> erupter: no
[13:05] <ThinkT510> erupter: real time operating systems?
[13:05] <histo> erupter: robot operating system?
[13:05] <erupter> histo, ok. there is a program that uses a certain library to broadcast laser scans. it has to be able to access the laser, which has a usb/tty connection
[13:05] <erupter> histo, yes
=== irick_ is now known as irick
[13:05] <erupter> ThinkT510, no
[13:05] <anonymous9999999> yes ROS is awesome
[13:05] <anonymous9999999> what laser scanner are you using?
[13:06]  * PatrickDickey was going for Really Old Software...
[13:06] <anonymous9999999> hokuyo?
[13:06] <histo> erupter: okay well why doyou need to give everyone read write?
[13:06] <erupter> histo, it can't access the tty in user space unless I either change the permissions or sudo it, since I can't always sudo it (remote launch) I have to change permissions
[13:06] <histo> erupter: what is "it"
[13:07] <erupter> histo, I don't know, just following the tutorial on the program. it says you have to chmod a+rw
[13:07] <txp> hello
[13:07] <yak_king> howdy txp : )
[13:07] <PatrickDickey> hello txp
[13:07] <histo> erupter: do you have a link for the tut?
[13:07] <erupter> anonymous9999999, urg04
[13:07] <erupter> histo: http://www.ros.org/wiki/hokuyo_node/Tutorials/UsingTheHokuyoNode
[13:07] <histo> erupter: I'm sure if you give "it" permisions properly using sudo it would work.
[13:07] <histo> erupter: hint visudo
[13:08] <erupter> histo, I don't want to
[13:08] <erupter> histo, moreover I will be mostly running the process remotely from automated ssh scripts
[13:08] <PatrickDickey> erupter if there's a group that already has the proper permissions (besides root), you could always add the user to that.
[13:09] <PatrickDickey> Isn't there an option in user permissions, for accessing USB or TTY devices?
[13:09] <erupter> PatrickDickey, I could create such a group, but given the fact that devices are (as far as I know) by default accessible only by root, how can I create a group that by default has access to devices?
[13:10] <Ben64> erupter: in the example on that site, "dialout" group has access to it
[13:10] <PatrickDickey> erupter: which version of ubuntu are you on?
[13:11] <erupter> 12.04
[13:12] <g-hennux> hi!
[13:12] <PatrickDickey> hi g-hennux
[13:12] <erupter> if I do ls -la /dev/ttyA* I get dialout too
[13:12] <erupter> but I don't know what's that...
[13:12] <g-hennux> i want to have my firewall script run on system startup, but after libvirt has started. can i safely run it from /etc/rc.local or is this executed before the init.d/* scripts are started?
[13:12] <PatrickDickey> erupter: it's a group that has permission to access modems. I would guess at least.
[13:13] <PatrickDickey> g-hennux: Can it run after you log in? If so, you can add it to startup applications.
=== lucas_nemeth_ is now known as lucas_nemeth
[13:15] <g-hennux> PatrickDickey: this is a server, i don't usually log in after reboot
[13:16] <Ben64> !upstart | g-hennux
[13:16] <ubottu> g-hennux: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[13:16] <arunkumar413> there are two audio devices on my laptop, how do i enable the amd idt audio device
[13:17] <anonymous9999999> erupter-i missed the beginning of this questioning but why aren't you just setting the permissions using udev?
[13:17] <PatrickDickey> erupter: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Privileges Look at "use modem" for an answer to what dialout does. Then you can search for adding user to a group.
[13:17] <erupter> anonymous9999999, because I don't know how :)
[13:17] <opalepatrick> I know you all love unity... how can I see what lens are installed?
[13:17] <erupter> PatrickDickey, that's what I've been doing the latest 10 mins :p
[13:18] <fidel> opalepatrick: i guess there are several ways - one might be using dpkg -l and grep that for lens
[13:18] <PatrickDickey> erupter: and did you find the information?
[13:18] <DJJeff> what is the gphoto2 filesystem and how can I get it work with ubuntu 12.10
[13:18] <erupter> PatrickDickey, about adding a user to a group, sure. easy enough
[13:18] <fidel> opalepatrick: as in: dpkg -l | grep lens
[13:18] <anonymous9999999> erupter, you don't know how?  Aren't you using udev for your motors?  It works much better to be able to address them as /dev/left_wheel and /dev/right_wheel then /dev/ttyUSB :)

[13:19] <PatrickDickey> erupter: then if you know that the dialout group has access to the tty, why not add your user to that group?

[13:19] <opalepatrick> actually that worked fine fidel
[13:19] <fidel> i know ;)
[13:20] <MonkeyDust> DJJeff  why do you wb
[13:20] <opalepatrick> lol
[13:20] <MonkeyDust> DJJeff  why do you want it, if you don't know what it is?
[13:20] <erupter> PatrickDickey, no that wasn't what I meant: I dind't realize there was a usergroup with access to the device until histo pointed that out to me, after that it was simple adding my user to that group.
[13:20] <anonymous9999999> erupter, you should read http://linux.die.net/man/8/udev  read the section on sample udev.permissions
[13:20] <erupter> anonymous9999999, am already, still I don't really need that at the moment

[13:21] <anonymous9999999> erupter, what's your robot do?  mapping?
[13:21] <PatrickDickey> erupter: Gottcha. If adding yourself to the dialout group takes care of the chmod a+rw thing, I wouldn't worry about a udev rule. Unless you need something else specfied.
[13:22]  * PatrickDickey just my .02 worth, which is worth about.000002 actually
[13:22] <arunkumar413> there are two audio devices on my laptop, how do i enable the amd idt audio device
[13:22] <erupter> anonymous9999999, at the moment pretty nothing. I'm implementing ros, so I'm still in the early stages. Previous existing platform (all custom) was used for testing swarm algorithms
[13:22] <yak_king> lol Patrick
[13:22] <erupter> PatrickDickey, thanks, that's my reasoning
[13:23] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: Right click on the volume control and choose "Sound Settings" and if it's listed in there, select it for your output device.
[13:23] <Guest93604> arunkumar413: first is your device supported? and are you using pulseaudio or alsa?
[13:23] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: no, its not listed
[13:23] <arunkumar413> Guest93604: don't know there is no sound icon in the panel
[13:24] <anonymous9999999> erupter, udev's not really very hard to figure out...i would recommend it so you can address your devices more conveniently.  it's also helpful in case your devices  change...i.e if your laser becomes /dev/ttyACM1 you can change a line in udev instead of having to rewrite your code....just my .02 from having worked on it before :)
[13:24] <anonymous9999999> arunkumar413, run alsamixer from terminal
[13:25] <erupter> anonymous9999999, thanks, I'll keep it in mind should I need that. although for these things ROS is wonderful: everything is parametric. I can even change the laser on-the-fly :)
[13:25] <erupter> and remotely to boot :D

[13:28] <PatrickDickey> Sounds like adobe has 'flashpox'.
[13:28] <stroodlepup> something like that patrick
[13:28] <anonymous9999999> erupter, what motor controller are you using?
[13:28] <erupter> anonymous9999999, ages ago... could really use a rework, but I can't even begin to put my mind to it...
[13:28] <CoreyBR> hello
[13:28] <yak_king> lol patrick
[13:29] <PatrickDickey> Hanmac: I'd venture that it's because you only deal with either i386 or amd64 regardless of whether it's ming or not.
[13:29] <stroodlepup> it kinda looks like static....
[13:29] <yak_king> howdy Corey
[13:29] <MonkeyDust> Hanmac  maybe because not enough people have ever heard about ming
[13:29] <erupter> anonymous9999999, custom developed: it's a PIC18 controlling some allegro drivers with 2 stepper motors, the robot is a small indoor tailored to being the most economic
[13:30] <anonymous9999999> erupter, cool.  how far along are you with ros?  Have you gotten to learn about transforms yet?  Those killed me
[13:30] <CoreyBR> yak_king, i'm good and u? :)
[13:30] <PatrickDickey> ming is supposed to help you run a linux environment in Windows right? (Or simulate one at least)
[13:30] <anonymous9999999> PatrickDickey, are you thinking of cygwin?
[13:31] <PatrickDickey> anonymous9999999: I thought they were both birds of the same feather. ;)
[13:31] <yak_king> erupter, anonymous9999999 You guys are obviously seasoned hobbyist so I hate to bug you with the basics but don't see the topic on robotics very often. One quick startup question, if I may?

[13:33] <Hanmac> CoreyBR i think its not an good idea to think about that
[13:34] <Noobuntu> Guys, I have been using a Ubuntu for a while and have a question that has been bothering me for some time. If you install software in for example 12.10 and that software has a config file in /ETC/APP/APP.CONF. Now when you make some changes in the conf file, what happens if you do a dist upgrade to 13.04? will the conf file be overwritten and your changes lost?
[13:34] <Hanmac> PatrickDickey & MonkeyDusk & anonymous9999999 : i am building ruby gems as C(++) extension and at some functions i dont know if they work on windows too, that why i want to build some test space, but i dont want to install an Windows VM if possible
[13:34] <arunkumar413> anonymous9999999: in windows the sound is crisp, loud and surround sound is there but where as in windows its like normal audio, no surround sound. i have dolby advanced audio on the laptop
[13:34] <CoreyBR> Hanmac, why?
[13:34] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, assume that a dist upgrade will overwrite previous configs
[13:35] <CoreyBR> is it forbidden to speak about things like these here? :s
[13:35] <arunkumar413> anonymous9999999: in windows the sound is crisp, loud and surround sound is there but where as in UBUNTU its like normal audio, no surround sound. i have dolby advanced audio on the laptop
[13:35] <CoreyBR> if so, i'm sorry lol i didnt know that
[13:35] <cfhowlett> Corey, its off topic.  use the offtopic channel for such, please.
[13:35] <anonymous9999999> yak_king, i learned on this book: http://www.amazon.com/Microcontroller-Theory-Applications-HC12-S12/dp/0136152058/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1359034519&sr=1-4&keywords=hcs12+microcontroller
[13:35] <CoreyBR> oh god, i tough i was on offtopic, sorry.
[13:35] <PatrickDickey> CoreyBR: I think he was being a bit sarcastic, but I could be wrong. And the question does belong in offtopic, unless it has to do with ubuntu.
[13:36] <Noobuntu> cfhowlett, Thanks! And what if the app used a file that suddenly is no longer needed in the new version? Will they remain as useless files on your OS or will they be removed?
[13:36] <PatrickDickey> LOL been there done that CoreyBR.
[13:36] <Guest93604> arunkumar413: did u read that link i sent you?
[13:36] <CoreyBR> PatrickDickey, HAHAHA i'm using a new irc client i'm kinda lost yet
[13:37] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, if you format your /filesystem, obviously they'll go away.  If you install without formatting, I'd imagine they'll remain as orphaned files.
[13:37] <PatrickDickey> CoreyBR: which one?
[13:37] <RollinV2> Corey, irssi or burst
[13:37] <stroodlepup> the garbled display in flash is annoying
[13:37] <CoreyBR> PatrickDickey, now i'm in XCHAT, i was in IRSSI and Finch
[13:37] <CoreyBR> both in terminal
[13:37] <arunkumar413> Guest93604: i didn't understand it
[13:37] <Noobuntu> cfhowlett, Is it bad practice then to do a dist-upgrade? and on a new ubuntu release (Every 6 months) one should always do a clean install?
[13:37] <PatrickDickey> cfhowlett: and Noobuntu, if the configs are there, doesn't the upgrade ask you what you want to do with them? I know for samba and a few others, it does.
[13:37] <Hanmac> Noobuntu: on a normal upgrade it does ask you what version you want (or trys to merge the changes) i dont know if this happends on dist upgrade too
[13:38] <cfhowlett> stroodlepup, seems to be a chrome/html5 issue.  bug has been filed.
[13:38] <ThinkT510> !dist-upgrade | Noobuntu
[13:38] <ubottu> Noobuntu: A dist-upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer needed. This will not bring you to a new release of Ubuntu, see !upgrade if that is your intention.
[13:38] <yak_king> thankyou so much anonymous9999999, checking it out now! my appologies to you and the room to steer you off topic. That'
[13:38] <Pici> Hanmac, Noobuntu: a dist-upgrade is NOT a release upgrade.
[13:38] <Guest93604> arunkumar413: there might be some deep file editing you might have to do in order to get it to work. Or you can just try to install pulseaudio, and it might detect it
[13:38] <Noobuntu> Ok Everyone, Sorry for the confusion. I did mean an OS upgrade.
=== MartinS is now known as Guest2502
[13:39] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, y u no use LTS?  seriously, unless you NEED the bleeding edge, I'd urge you to consider just riding the LTS version.  Fewer headaches, more stability, longer support ...
[13:39] <Hanmac> Pici i know i mean that apt-get command
[13:39] <Guest93604> arunkumar413:  as for an example..i have a set of small usb speakers....alsa didn't detect them automaticly..i had to edit alsa.conf...but pulse audio found em right away
[13:39] <cfhowlett> PatrickDickey, honestly I don't recall ever seeing the question, but then I only clean install my dist-upgrades
[13:40] <arunkumar413> Guest93604: what is the diff between alsa and pulse
[13:40] <PatrickDickey> cfhowlett: I've had it with a few configurations. Typically I just let it overwrite them, and then I fix them if needed. It should give the option of seeing a diff between the versions.
[13:40] <cfhowlett> PatrickDickey, in the interest of clarity, I referred to release-upgrades ...
[13:40] <arunkumar413> Guest93604: are they drivers
[13:40] <Guest93604> arunkumar413: they both do the same thing "bring sound to your speakers" one just has better support
[13:40] <PatrickDickey> cfhowlett: I knew what you meant. ;)
[13:40] <stroodlepup> howlett, I'll post a screenshot...
[13:41] <cfhowlett> stroodlepup,  see the following   http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/chrome-flickering-videos-on-youtube-4175445575/
[13:41] <Guest93604> arunkumar413: as for an example...pulseaudio seems to work better for using bluetooth headphones
[13:41] <arunkumar413> Guest93604: then what is dolby and amd IDT
[13:41] <Noobuntu> cfhowlett, I guess I just have a soft spot for new features :). So if I would always want the latest release,  the cleanest way is to do a clean install every time? As an upgrade would leave orphaned files?
[13:42] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: Dolby is a type of noise reduction (and a company) and amd IDT is a brand of High Definition audio cards.
[13:42] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, I'd suggest clean upgrade with formatted /filesystem and, of course, a separate /home so you don't have to start COMPLETELY over each time.
[13:42] <ThinkT510> Noobuntu: a clean install is simply less complicated, more can go wrong with an upgrade
=== Guest13871 is now known as Topology
[13:42] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: alsamixer and pulseaudio are the ways that your computer allows you to interact with those cards.
=== Topology is now known as Triassic
[13:43] <anonymous9999999> Noobuntu, you can still keep whatever apps you care about up to date with a PPA.  I would highly recommend staying on the LTS...the other ones have a strong tendency to be buggy
[13:43] <PatrickDickey> I agree about the clean install vs upgrade. If you're building a new home, why use an old foundation?
[13:43] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: if that is so, then i think the default card is intel hda, i want to make it amd idt
=== Triassic is now known as triassic
[13:45] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: the problem is, your sound settings don't "see" that card. So, either it's a driver issue, or it's something with the sound settings. The suggestion to install pulseaudio is there to help rule out which one it is. And it's the easier of the two options (changing sound systems or finding/installing drivers)
[13:45] <sg20002> Hello. Can somebody help me with kernel panic? I get "/sbin/init: Accessing a corrupted shared library" when loading and then krenel panic happens. What's weird - it's not telling me what lib is broken.
[13:45] <Noobuntu> Hmm, Those are some good points indeed. And what about applications in general. For example a music player, let's say you change a preference. Will most applications store a preference file in your /HOME or will settings be saved in /ETC?
[13:45] <PatrickDickey> sg20002: Did you make any changes recently, or has this been happening since you installed?
[13:45] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, user preferences generally go to the user /home
[13:46] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: installed the pulse audio, but still the sound icon is not there on the panel
[13:47] <anonymous9999999> Noobuntu, some will go in /etc but majority will go in /home...I would back up your /etc directory each time you do a reinstall
[13:47] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: in your menu, you should have some options for pulse now.
[13:47] <Noobuntu> On an unrelated note: Y WE NO HAVE Sublime 2 IN SOFTWARE CENTER?
[13:47] <sg20002> PatrickDickey: That machine worked for ages. There were no changes recently, but apparently it was having some weird problems not so long ago.
[13:48] <zetheroo> if I go to the System Settings and then to Details > Graphics the Driver is "Unknown" - why is that?
[13:48] <PatrickDickey> sg20002: is it always the same message before the panic? Also, what do you see in /var/log/kernel.log around the time of the panic?
[13:48] <PatrickDickey> zetheroo: what kind of video card do you have?
[13:48] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, cuz REAL *nix users speak vim!  or vi?  or gedit?
[13:48] <Pici> Noobuntu: because no one has packaged it.
[13:48] <anonymous9999999> what is sublimme 2?
[13:48] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: no there are no options

[13:49] <Noobuntu> cfhowlett, Your not a fan of a nice looking gui are you ;-).
[13:49] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: When you say that, you're looking in the sound settings, right?
[13:50] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, sublime 2 website profile is shown on ubuntu.  Looks good
[13:50] <zetheroo> Guest93604: I realize that there are ways of getting information via terminal ... but I am curious as to why this dialog is not picking up the Driver in use
[13:50] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: yes
[13:51] <stroodlepup> cfhowlett, still there?
[13:51] <Noobuntu> Oh yeah Swap shouldn't be on the SSD I guess?
[13:51] <Guest93604> zetheroo: ah...no idea.
[13:51] <cfhowlett> stroodlepup, until starbucks kicks me out ...
[13:51] <Guest93604> zetheroo: as for an output in a gui i just use sysinfo
[13:52] <zetheroo> Guest93604: right

[13:53] <cfhowlett> stroodlepup, noted
[13:53] <stroodlepup> i'll be posting mine
[13:53] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: You might have to close sound settings and reopen it. Otherwise, you can also type lspci | grep Audio in a terminal, and see if it shows that card.
[13:54]  * PatrickDickey should really be activating "sleep mode" for himself--not the computer. :P
[13:55] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: lspci shows there are two device from amd
[13:55] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: and is one of them the right device?
[13:55] <arunkumar413> arun@ubuntu:~$ lspci | grep Audio

[13:56] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: is this the sound card
[13:56] <Ben64> arunkumar413: could  you pastebin the entire "lspci"
[13:57] <Noobuntu> How well does ubuntu handle multiple monitors?
[13:57] <MrBl33t> i run multiple fine
[13:57] <Noobuntu> For example having "virtual pixels" in between monitors.

[13:59] <zetheroo> has there been any progress in regards to the slow file transfer speed from HDD to USB stick!?
[14:00] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: And which card shows up in Sound Settings?
[14:01] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: arun@ubuntu:~$ lspci | grep Audio
[14:01] <arunkumar413> 00:01.1 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Device 9902
[14:01] <VlanX> is there a way of showing the exact size in bytes when you click property on a folder?
[14:01] <arunkumar413> 00:14.2 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] Hudson Azalia Controller (rev 01)
[14:02] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: When you open Sound Settings, (where you were before you started typing in the terminal) which device is listed there?
[14:02] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: this is what i want to do, enable the correct sound card, configure the correct audio driver for the device, use the best sound card control system to configure the channels and woofers
[14:02] <toter> my question is kinda silly, but… Do any of you guys know how to enable an option in Gnome 3 to auto arrange icons? Every single time I remove a folder or file from the desktop, i have to manually right-click and select "organizee desktop by name"...
[14:03] <toter> *organize
[14:03] <Ben64> arunkumar413: you do realize its a laptop, right?
[14:03] <arunkumar413> Ben64: yes
[14:03] <stroodlepup> cfhowlett http://imagebin.org/index.php?mode=image&id=244047
[14:03] <Ben64> it has like... two tiny speakers under the screen
[14:04] <cfhowlett> stroodlepup, exactly as described.  I'm going to go with the theory of a chrome bug as found in that link I sent.  Fix?  Try a different browser maybe?
[14:05] <arunkumar413> Ben64: they may be tiny, the sound they produce is awesome in windows, as i said before the surround is not felt in linux. By the way did you ever listen to the dolby advanced audio altec lansing speakers sound on hp laptop in winodws
[14:05] <PatrickDickey> arunkumar413: Ben64 has a good point how are you connecting your external speakers to the laptop? Does it actually have an output for them, or are you connecting through the headphone jack?
[14:05] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: i'm using the internal speakers of the phone
[14:06] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: i'm using the internal speakers of the laptop
[14:06] <blami> so many internal speakers ...
[14:06] <PatrickDickey> !sound | arunkumar413 this might help you. Especially Troubleshooting sound.
[14:06] <ubottu> arunkumar413 this might help you.

[14:06] <Ben64> its probably just a difference in equalization and/or processing effects
[14:07] <IdleOne> riply: can you send to channel now?
[14:07] <Noobuntu> Is a GTX 690 supported in ubuntu?
[14:07] <arunkumar413> Ben64: ah, may be its the wrong driver
[14:07] <theseus> everytime I turn on my laptop without the power cable plugged in Ubuntu 12.04 won't boot to unity, any ideas?
[14:08] <sgo11> hi, how to install latest version of gthumb? the version in repo is too old. thanks.
[14:08] <MonkeyDust> sgo11  find a ppa, but at your own risk, not supporte here
[14:08] <PatrickDickey> Noobuntu: http://us.download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86/304.37/README/supportedchips.html has a list of supported Nvidia cards in Linux.
[14:09] <Eagleman>  As far as i know i am using dovecot only as SASL authentication backend for postfix, do you suggest disabling all functions that are currently not in use ( imap pop3... ) ?
[14:09] <Noobuntu> Cheers!
[14:09] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, have fun, be safe
[14:09] <PatrickDickey> Eagleman, I'd say yes. But you're better off asking in #dovecot than here.
[14:09] <cfhowlett> sgo11, download and compile from source is one option ...
[14:09] <riply> test
[14:10] <arunkumar413> PatrickDickey: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566149/  play back is a generic audio device not the amd idt
[14:10] <PatrickDickey> riply pass
[14:10] <riply> PatrickDickey, thank you!
[14:10] <PatrickDickey> riply no problem.
[14:11] <Noobuntu> cfhowlett, PatrickDickey, thanks for your support! Btw, are there any people here that game frequently?
[14:11] <sgo11> cfhowlett, where can I download the source? or where can I find the ppa? I did lots of search. no luck. Not many people mention gthumb... it's the best image viewer I can find in linux.
[14:11] <MrBl33t> pretty impressed with 13.04. still needs nvidia upgrade sorting though. boots to a out of size desktop, you have to purge remove nvidia and reinstall to get it too work...
[14:11] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, they come through.  expect more with steam coming online.  I think there's an irc for linux games
[14:11] <sg20002> PatrickDickey: Hmm Kernel logging seems to be disabled, since the last log is old. Is there a way to turn it on without booting the machine?
[14:11] <PatrickDickey> Noobuntu: I do on occasion, but not much.
[14:12] <Ben64> Noobuntu: i play lots of tf2

[14:12] <PatrickDickey> sg20002: I'm not sure. How long does it go before it kernel panics?
[14:12] <Noobuntu> cfhowlett, PatrickDIckey, Yes I'm excited with the release of steam on Linux. I do wonder why it hasn't caught on more. For example: WoW. They have an OSX client, how hard could it be to port it to linux? :/
[14:13] <Ben64> Noobuntu: there already is a linux client for wow
[14:13] <theseus> everytime I turn on my laptop without the power cable plugged in, Ubuntu 12.04 won't boot to unity, any ideas?
[14:13] <PatrickDickey> Noobuntu: most likely it's just a demand issue.
[14:13] <cfhowlett> Noobuntu, ask gaben.  I'm just glad that it's finally happening.
[14:13] <sg20002> PatrickDickey: I think it crashes just after initing ethernet connection.
[14:14] <sgo11> cfhowlett, when I do apt-cache show gthumb, mine show pool/universe/g/gthumb/gthumb_3.0.2-0ubuntu2_amd64.deb. why?
[14:14] <PatrickDickey> sg20002: Can you boot it into recovery mode?
[14:14] <sg20002> PatrickDIckey: No, the same thing happens.
[14:14] <Noobuntu> The excuse that's used often is that the userbase is too small. But if there would be games the userbase would grow. It's just a matter of getting things started really.
[14:14] <kostkon> Noobuntu, blizzard will announce a linux games this year. you never know, it might be a wow linux client.
[14:14] <cfhowlett> sgo11, i'm on 12.04 and enabled backports ...
[14:14] <Noobuntu> koston, where have you read that?
[14:14] <sgo11> cfhowlett, I am on 12.10.
[14:15] <kostkon> Noobuntu, all over the net :P try phoronix.com
[14:15] <Noobuntu> Ben64, what do you mean there is a linux client? If you mean using Wine, that's not a real client to me.
[14:15] <Ben64> Noobuntu: What I mean is, Blizzard made and has a working Linux native client for World of Warcraft
[14:15] <sgo11> cfhowlett, what does enabled backports mean? thanks.
[14:16] <Noobuntu> Ben64, Hmm Googling on that now. Color me surprised!
[14:16] <cfhowlett> sgo11, i'm on 12.04.  if a 12.10 package is enabled for 12.04, I can get it if I have enabled "backports" as in a backwards ported package.
[14:17] <PatrickDickey> sgo11: Mine says Version: 3:3.0.2-0ubuntu2 when I do apt-cache show gthumb (on Lubuntu 12.10).
[14:17] <w0rm-_x> In Ubuntu how do I check what programs are running just like in windows task manager?
[14:17] <sgo11> cfhowlett, ok. I guess I have backports too. I can see deb http://cn.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ quantal-backports in sources.list. why ubuntu 12.04 has higher gthumb version than ubuntu 12.10 ? weird.
[14:17] <kostkon> w0rm-_x, open your system monitor
[14:17] <PatrickDickey> sg20002: I'm not sure how to help you then. The last set of kernel panics that I had was due to bad memory. So, that's an option (running memtest86).
[14:17] <w0rm-_x> kostkon, where is that?
[14:17] <sgo11> PatrickDickey, yeah, the same version I have.
[14:18] <Noobuntu> One of the big problems with Linux, and this is from other game developers too, is the problem of targeting a specific version of the platform. Since everyone is free to create their own distros, they can become somewhat unstandardized. That makes "targeting linux" difficult.
[14:18] <cfhowlett> sgo11, in terminal run apt-cache policy gthumb and see what you get
[14:18] <Noobuntu> I Lol'd when I read that.
[14:18] <deadmund> What is a good replacement for sudo service networking stop || start || restart   now that this feature is gone
[14:18] <kostkon> w0rm-_x, just search for it in the dash, assuming you are using ubuntu 11.10+

[14:18] <sgo11> cfhowlett, I still got 3:3.0.2-0ubuntu2
[14:18] <PatrickDickey> Noobuntu: then they target the two main versions. Fedora/Debian(Ubuntu).
[14:18] <gene_> #lubuntu
[14:19] <sgo11> it seems gthumb 3.7 has been released.
[14:19] <sg20002> PatrickDickey: Thanks anyways. Tried memtest.
[14:19] <Noobuntu> PatrickDickey, Indeed! But it does mean that they would have to make a lot of different deb's / rpm's? For the different versions and the 32 BIT / 64 BIT
[14:19] <w0rm-_x> kostkon, got it thanks
[14:19] <PatrickDickey> sgo11: Do they have a .deb file? Or is it tied into Gnome 3.7?
[14:19] <kostkon> w0rm-_x, :)
[14:19] <MonkeyDust> sgo11  latest is not always the best choice
[14:20] <cfhowlett> sgo11, I'm on ubuntustudio.  xubuntu is the DE ...
[14:20] <PatrickDickey> Noobuntu: I think they'd just have to update the libraries and dependencies if those change. But both Fedora and Ubuntu are on 6 to 12 month release schedules. So it's not like they'd be doing it every day/week.
[14:20] <sgo11> I really hate the idea importing photos/pictures before viewing it. shotwell etc... being the default image viewer. sucks. I like viewing images by browsing folders.
[14:21] <Noobuntu> Also, I can imagine game developers want to protect their code. Are you that well protected against reverse engineering in Ubuntu?
[14:21] <PatrickDickey> sg20002: Are you running memtest now, or did you already try it? And if you already tried it, did you get any errors?
[14:21] <cfhowlett> sgo11, fyi    http://www.rileybrandt.com/2012/07/31/linux-photo-1/
[14:22] <sg20002> PatrickDickey: No errors.
[14:22] <ShapeShifter499> Hi
[14:22] <cfhowlett> ShapeShifter499, greetings
[14:22] <PatrickDickey> Noobuntu: I'd say you're as protected as you are in Windows. By that I mean someone can do it, if they want to.
[14:23] <Noobuntu> PatrickDickey, but I think for windows you extra sets of tools to scramble your code. Altough I must admit I don't really know what I'm talking about :).
[14:23] <ShapeShifter499> Is it possible to disable ssh password and instead have my system email me a new ssh key every day?
[14:23] <cfhowlett> sgo11, found the ppa  http://www.webupd8.org/2012/04/gthumb-300-released-ubuntu-ppa.html
[14:24] <erupter> mmm I think I screwed something with the network management... I ran some sudo iwconfig commands, and now, when I launch unity, the whole connection manager doesn't appear -_-
[14:24] <ankr> Hello people. I just installed 12.04 and saw the new "Show desktop" option when switching windows with Alt+Tab.... Is there a way to remove that?

[14:37] <devmark> i want the old one, as windows, not on left side
[14:37] <zykotick9> !notunity | devmark
[14:37] <ubottu> devmark: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[14:37] <MonkeyDust> !notunity | devmark
[14:37] <e-dard> on my remote machine I get: ssh -T git@github.com --> Permission denied (publickey).

[14:37] <e-dard> and also: ssh-add -L show --> Could not open a connection to your authentication agent.
[14:38] <PatrickDickey> devmark: if you don't want Gnome, you can use sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop (KDE) xubuntu-desktop (XFCE) or lubuntu-desktop (LXDE) amongst others.
[14:38] <e-dard> when I do the same process to another remote server everything is fine. I know the issue is with remote_server and not my local machine.

[14:42] <arnab> Hi, I was messing around in keybinds, and somehow managed to bind "Ctrl+S" to something else than save...Now I can't see where I can rebind it to save :<
[14:42] <pythonsnake> is there a bitlbee with skype in the repos?
[14:42] <pythonsnake> anyone using bitlbee with skype here?
[14:43] <zykotick9> arnab: fyi ctrl+s is application specific, just remove whatever keybinding you've added for ctrl+S "should" restore it's behaviour
[14:44] <c2tarun> how can I check for a packages version in repository?
[14:44] <e-dard> when I do ssh -vT git@github.com I can see that it does not offer up my private key on my local machine. It's not being forwarded correctly
[14:44] <arnab> zykotick9: thanks! :)
[14:44] <devmark> how do i then avaible kubuntu after install?

[14:45] <erupter> my ubuntu workstation has 2 network interfaces, unfortunately catting /etc/resolv.conf shows the wrong DNS gets prioritized. how do I go about this?
[14:45] <KC4LZN> Are there any references, paid or free, on how to write rules in udev other than this site I found? http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html
[14:46] <MonkeyDust> devmark  like you said, sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
[14:46] <erupter> essentially I need both DNS but the one I choose must be the first to be called

[14:47] <erupter> Valko, don't you need auto eth1 auto eth2 auto eth3 too?
[14:47] <MonkeyDust> devmark  never tried it, i'm sure someone else can help
[14:48] <Valko> oh yeah, thanks erupter xD didn't thought about this
[14:48] <devmark> MonkeyDust: now i did kubuntu install, but it looks the same? how do i switch over to Kubuntu and vice versa?
[14:48] <jrib> e-dard: does it get offered when you ssh elsewhere?
[14:48] <zykotick9> Valko: in addition to what erupter just mentioned, do you really have dhcp servers connect to each nic?
[14:48] <Noobuntu> Is there anything near the Visual Studio IDE for ubuntu?
[14:48] <cfhowlett> devmark, reboot and when you get to the login screen, select kubuntu session
[14:49] <erupter> Noobuntu, Netbeans, Eclipse
[14:49] <Valko> no, it's an home server,
[14:49] <devmark> cfhowlett: I didnt install ubuntu, i run it from live cd?
[14:49] <devmark> does that make any matter?
[14:49] <cfhowlett> devmark, well, then that won't work
[14:49] <MonkeyDust> devmark  logout, select kde, mogin

[14:50] <MonkeyDust> ah, live cd, missed that part

[14:57] <NielsMkn> I'm trying to install gnome-session-fallback but it keeps saying that its not available in your software sources. I've selected the main server for download in software sources
[14:59] <devmark> where is everything from ubuntu gonna be saved? if I run live cd
[15:00] <MonkeyDust> devmark  not
[15:00] <KC4LZN> Are there any references, paid or free, on how to write herb rules other than the man pages or this website? http://reactivated.net/writing_udev_rules.html
[15:01] <KC4LZN> *udev rules..
[15:01] <Pici> KC4LZN: you could try #ubuntu-desktop, they might have some better resources.
[15:01] <devmark> MonkeyDust: not? somewhere it must be saved?
[15:01] <devmark> MonkeyDust: in memory maybe?
[15:02] <devmark> where is log files saving? if i run live cd ubuntu?
[15:02] <MonkeyDust> devmark  when you end the live session, all saves and modifications are lost
[15:03] <devmark> MonkeyDust: so nobody not even the police can see, that i have been used ubuntu?
[15:03] <MonkeyDust> devmark  "not even the police"
[15:04] <devmark> MonkeyDust:ok ty
[15:04] <devmark> i think there must be some small dumbs in memory or cache
[15:04] <devmark> ?
[15:04] <theseus> everytime I turn on my laptop without the power cable plugged in, Ubuntu 12.04 won't boot to unity, any ideas?
[15:05] <Pici> devmark: RAM is volitile memory, it does not retain anything after power is removed.

[15:06] <devmark> Pici: i know, but is there no cache in harddrive, that they can see "this guy has been used ubuntu, and they can see what homepages he has visit"? is this not possible with live cd?
[15:06] <theseus> the wierd thing is, I can boot up my laptop with the power cord plugged in, boot into ubuntu and then unplug the power cable and everything works fine
[15:06] <theseus> still
[15:06] <Pici> devmark: the live cd does not write anything to your harddrive.
[15:06] <theseus> just cant boot up correctly when charging cable isn't plugged in
[15:07] <rman__> hi guys
[15:07] <devmark> Pici: okay, so answer is no? caouse it sounds "not sure"
[15:07] <jhutchins> dpurgert: Morning.  That guy ever get his networking figured out?
[15:07] <Pici> devmark: its no.
[15:07] <devmark> Pici: ok ty
[15:07] <devmark> i really like ubuntu
[15:07] <devmark> i didnt know they had update it so much
[15:07] <devmark> first time i used it, it was more like windows
[15:08] <tarunsh> how can one get microsoft word to work on ubuntu?
[15:08] <Pici> !wine | tarunsh
[15:08] <ubottu> tarunsh: WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[15:09] <helmut__> hi
[15:09] <rman__> hello
[15:09] <sky__> anyone there?
[15:10] <tarunsh> or is there any good word like software which is open source....libre office is not matched to word.
[15:10] <Mikicacarica> http://bit.ly/WQ4xl8
[15:10] <Pici> sky__: There are 1800 people here, if you have a question, just ask.
[15:10] <Dionist> tarunsh- what do you mean it's not matched to Word?
[15:11] <sky__> ok, i will , thks
[15:11] <bentinata> Pici:  yeah, 1.8k but only ~7 who notice
[15:11] <MonkeyDust> Dionist  he's  provoking a discussion
[15:11] <tarunsh> i mean pffice tools like powerpoint, word etc are more convenient...now when i dont have windows on my system...i want good options
[15:11] <NielsMkn> gtg later
[15:12] <Guest4229> MonkeyDust: troll detected :p...
[15:12] <sky__> some people join and quit all the time
[15:12] <jhutchins> tarunsh: open/libre office are the closest things to the MS stuff.  koffice is not as advanced.
[15:12] <Dionist> Tarunsh: Can't help you there. OpenOffice/LibreOffice is best for me, haven't used Word in years.
[15:12] <bentinata> sky__: disable your join/part messages
[15:13] <tarunsh> ok...thanx...well i will need some time to get used to it....
[15:13] <bentinata> sky__: what irc client you use?
[15:14] <tarunsh> Pici, ubottu...thanx for the "wine" thingy
[15:14] <irick> tarunsh: you have two options really. LibreOffice/OpenOffice or run Microsoft Office under WINE. The easiest way to do that is to take your Microsoft Office installation CD and use PlayOnLinux to walk you through the installation.
[15:14] <sky__> XCHAT-GNOME
[15:14] <sky__> why?
[15:14] <ritz> sky_ it is broken
[15:15] <tarunsh> ok..got it....will it be slowed down or become sluggish with wine?
[15:15] <tarunsh> in any way
[15:15] <zell> hello
[15:15] <irick> Not really.
[15:15] <zell> can anyone tell me how can I set root $PATH ?
[15:15] <tarunsh> ok..
[15:15] <jrib> zell: why?
[15:15] <tarunsh> then that is the best option i guess
[15:16] <zell> (I just modified /etc/environment, but i didn't modified my root user PATH)
[15:16] <katsumeblisk> tarunsh: Depends on your hardware.
[15:16] <aminosamigos> Hello
[15:16] <zell> jrib: i need it to execute php adminstration tasks
[15:16] <jrib> zell: how are you trying to execute them?
[15:16] <tarunsh> <katsumeblisk> ok
[15:16] <zell> zell: sudo pecl upgrade mongo
[15:17] <zell> zell: sudo pecl upgrade go take /usr/bin/php when i want him to use another one
[15:17] <jhutchins> tarunsh: You may need crossover office if you need more than the basics.
[15:17] <zell> jrib:
[15:17] <zell> (ofc, I just talekd to my self twice XD)
[15:18] <tarunsh> jhutchins : what is crossoer office?
[15:19] <zell> jrib: i want to proritize a whole bin folder before another ...
[15:19] <zell> jrib: that's why i changed the path
[15:19] <zell> jrib: but not working for root
[15:20] <soahccc> I just discovered apt-dater... Isn't there something like this which doesn't require anything on the remote side except SSH and aptitude obviously?
[15:21] <jrib> zell: ubuntu uses the secure_path option (see man pages for "sudoers" and "sudo").  You can see what it's set to in your /etc/sudoers (edit with the command "visudo")
[15:23] <tarunsh> this place is really cool, great way to get ubuntu related help.
[15:23] <jrib> zell: I'm not familiar with pecl, but I see that it's installed /usr/bin/pecl from from the php-pear package.  Isn't /usr/bin already in your root's PATH?
[15:24] <ikonia> please don't use pecl
[15:24] <ikonia> it's bad, it will cause you pain in the log run
[15:24] <jrib> zell: see ikonia
[15:24] <PrincessLuna> Do Multi touch systems like 5 and 10 point work in ubuntu
[15:25] <EdePopede> hi all, any chance to find out kernel version of xubuntu 12.10 without booting?
[15:25] <katsumeblisk> PrincessLuna: Depends on the hardware.
[15:26] <orudie> hi. what works better with ubuntu 12.04, virtualbox or vmware workstation ?
[15:26] <jrib> EdePopede: the default one?  The latest one? Or the one on your current system whose files you have access to at the moment?
[15:26] <PrincessLuna> katsumeblisk: Does it work (assuming drivers etc exist)
[15:26] <jhutchins> tarunsh: crossover office is the commercial version of wine, able to do more proprietary stuff.
[15:26] <MonkeyDust> orudie  virtualbow is in the repos
[15:26] <EdePopede> the one on my cd
[15:26] <MonkeyDust> orudie  virtualbox* is in the repos
[15:27] <EdePopede> jrib: volname says Xubuntu 12.10 amd64
[15:27] <jrib> EdePopede: ok, but I don't know which question you want the answer too
[15:28] <jhutchins> PrincessLuna: Like katsumeblisk said, it depends on the hardware and whether there is linux support for it from the manufacturer.
[15:28] <EdePopede> jrib: like what would uname -r say?
[15:29] <jrib> EdePopede: you can look at /boot/grub/grub.cfg to see what the default kernel is.  You could also just list the kernels in /boot and take a guess that it would boot the latest one
[15:30] <PrincessLuna> jhutchins: Are there any 10 point and 5 point touch devices that work? Do KDE (primarily) or even unity accept multi touch gestures for interfacing?
[15:30] <in^> anyone having audio problems in Chrome?
[15:30] <EdePopede> .disk/info says: Xubuntu 12.10 "Quantal Quetzal" - Release amd64 (20121017.1) ... and grub.cfg has absolutely no numbers
[15:31] <Pricey> Are there still compositing issues when your total screen(s) size breaches 2k in either direction?
[15:31] <Pricey> If "maybe", are they only with certain cards... intels...?
[15:32] <jhutchins> PrincessLuna: The only data on hardware compatibility is reports contributed by users, most of whom don't bother to make a report.  You can search for specific hardware and see if anyone has it working, but multipoint interfaces like that are far from common.
[15:33] <njd001> hmmm !java
[15:34] <SnapSnap> Is there a way to revert a dist-upgrade?
[15:34] <jhutchins> SnapSnap: Restore your backup.

[15:36] <njd001> i installed java based on some n00b url
[15:36] <auronandace> !java | njd001
[15:36] <ubottu> njd001: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[15:36] <njd001> java runs fine in the cli but the browers isnt linked
[15:36] <njd001> heyy i just tried that i guess you have to do ! command without text before it?
[15:37] <auronandace> njd001: yes, the !command has to be first

[15:53] <ikonia> njd001: it's "ok" to be new or inexperienced, so I don't know why you are trying to justify asking basic questions, it's "ok" to ask basic questions
[15:53] <belgianguy> but if I try to view it using vlc (reading from /dev/video1) I get a green image
[15:53] <ikonia> Diegosnat: why do you want to boot to an open box prompt
[15:54] <nick_h> ikonia: the uid is definitely associated with a username, though. ps outputs user ID 117, and `getent passwd 117` outputs "elasticsearch:x:117:127::/var/lib/elasticsearch:/bin/false"

[15:54] <philinux> belgianguy: try it with the app cheese
[15:54] <ikonia> Diegosnat: because it's not, what has openbox got to do with anything you've just said
[15:54] <ikonia> nick_h: that's very odd
[15:55] <belgianguy> philinux: that defaults to my default Webcam, while I inserted another one through USB
[15:55] <ikonia> nick_h: if you "su - elasticsearch" and then do "id" does it report back ok ?
[15:55] <Diegosnat> ikonia, sorry i meant virtualbox
[15:55] <belgianguy> philinux: ah, I can pick sources, in Preferences
[15:56] <belgianguy> still green :(
[15:56] <ikonia> Diegosnat: ??? what ? that makes no sense
[15:56] <philinux> belgianguy: soes it need a driver?
[15:56] <usuario> olaaaaa
[15:56] <Diegosnat> ikonia, minimal linux + virtualbox = multiboot
[15:56] <usuario> k pasa
[15:57] <ikonia> Diegosnat: what are you saying, it makes no sense
[15:57] <jhutchins> Diegosnat: When most people say multiboot they mean that the system can boot into multiple OSs or releases.
[15:57] <ikonia> Diegosnat: that has nothing to do with multiboot
[15:57] <nick_h> ikonia: the elasticsearch user's shell is /bin/false , so one can't switch to that user
[15:57] <Pici> Diegosnat: Are you looking to run virtual machines with graphical interfaces directly on that computer?
[15:57] <ikonia> Diegosnat: 1.) boot linux 2.) start virtual box application 3.) boot any vm's you want
[15:57] <jhutchins> ikonia: I think he wants to boot a VM host, then have the option to launch multiple VMs of various systems.  Not the most efficient way to do it, but possible.
[15:58] <ikonia> jhutchins: booting any linux distro will give you that
[15:58] <Diegosnat> ikonia, right
[15:58] <jhutchins> Diegosnat: There is no pre-configured install that's meant to do that, you could just do a minimal install and add what you needed for the VM host.
[15:58] <Diegosnat> dont u think that would be cool?
[15:59] <ikonia> the fact that you are asking these questions suggest you should not be using a minimal install
[15:59] <ikonia> Diegosnat: ????? what are you talking about "that would be cool" any linux distro already does this ??
[15:59] <Diegosnat> ikonia, you dont understand the idea
[15:59] <jhutchins> Diegosnat: Both VMWare and RedHat offer optimized hypervisors.  I believe that the VMWare product is more highly optimized.
[16:00] <Diegosnat> jhourani, thank you
[16:00] <Diegosnat> however i want to install that on my laptop
[16:00] <Diegosnat> i want to boot up the linux distro with vmware or virtualbox in seconds
[16:00] <ikonia> Diegosnat:....I'm pretty sure you want al linux distro, that on boot allows you to start/auto start VM's ?
[16:00] <Diegosnat> and after from there decide what I want to boto
[16:00] <Diegosnat> boot
[16:00] <ikonia> Diegosnat: errrr the boot time has nothing to do with that
[16:00] <ikonia> Diegosnat: that's disk / ram / cpu limitations
[16:00] <ikonia> Diegosnat: boot any linux distro, set vbox to auto start....problem solved
[16:01] <Diegosnat> ikonia, thank you, i knew that
[16:01] <Diegosnat> I was wondering if there was something ready
[16:01] <ikonia> then why are you saying it ?
[16:01] <ikonia> Diegosnat: there is....any linux distro
[16:01] <ikonia> any linux distro is "ready"
[16:01] <Diegosnat> -_-'
[16:01] <belgianguy> I tried using it through MPlayer
[16:01] <jhutchins> Diegosnat: I think what ikonia is on about is that you can set up a system that will actually boot to multiple different installed OSs without having to use a VM.  What a VM gives you is the ability to run more than one OS at the same time, within hardware limits.
[16:01] <belgianguy> but there I get a slew of errors http://pastebin.com/qJY8Vq8t
[16:01] <Diegosnat> ikonia, you do not understand
[16:01] <Diegosnat> i know that
[16:01] <Diegosnat> I want one ready
[16:02] <Diegosnat> that boot only vmware
[16:02] <Diegosnat> and i can install it and be ready
[16:02] <ikonia> Diegosnat: they are all ready
[16:02] <ikonia> Diegosnat: vmware is a comercial product
[16:02] <ikonia> Diegosnat: the version you want is called "VMWARE ESX Server"
[16:02] <ikonia> Diegosnat: that is exaclty what you've asked for
[16:02] <Diegosnat> ikonia, avoid to talk to me
[16:03] <Diegosnat> you are stubborn
[16:03] <Diegosnat> and you think to be superior
[16:03] <ikonia> Diegosnat: you're just asking for something that already exists
[16:03] <mojtaba> Hi
[16:03] <Diegosnat> what you are saying is obvious and everyone knows it.
[16:03] <Diegosnat> NO IT DOES NOT
[16:03] <ikonia> Diegosnat: then why are you asking for something
[16:03] <jhutchins> ikonia: Your arguing with him isn't helping anybody.
[16:04] <mojtaba> Does anybody know how can I automatically email the external IP address of the server?
[16:04] <ikonia> jhutchins: no, it's clearly not, it's a waste of time
[16:04] <jhutchins> belgianguy: Does it work despite the "errors"?
[16:04] <Diegosnat> ikonia, if you do not understand because you think to be so cool is pointless
[16:04] <belgianguy> jhutchins: no, I get error after error
[16:05] <belgianguy> however, some frames seem to be parsed correctly, at least it states so at the end
[16:05] <Pici> mojtaba: Huh? Can you rephrase that or maybe explain what you're trying to acheive?
[16:05] <MonkeyDust> mojtaba  i guess the people in #bash can tell you how to write a script to that end
[16:05] <Diegosnat> jhutchins, I want to install a minimal distro that boots to virtualbox. Does it exist? I know that I can configure everydistro to do that, but i want a very minimal one that is already configured that when X starts open virtual box
[16:05] <jhutchins> mojtaba: There are are a number of programs like the dyndns client that can automatically update a DNS service, some of those can also work via email.  I wrote my own when I needed one.
[16:05] <ikonia> Diegosnat: that is not an ubuntu question - so please stop asking in this channel
[16:05] <jhutchins> Diegosnat: Not that I know of, you could ask in #vbox.
[16:05] <ikonia> Diegosnat: we support Ubuntu here - only ubuntu
[16:06] <jhutchins> ikonia: Please just back off.
[16:06] <techThijs> yum install ubuntu =)
[16:06] <njd001> ikonia why would virt-manager say that KVM is not available if i do virtlibd -d it does not seem to want to start.
[16:06] <ikonia> njd001: is the kvm module loaded ?

[16:09] <njd001> yes performance sucks it seems.
[16:09] <ikonia> ????
[16:09] <makerbreakr> is it possble to restart lightdm from a cron job?
[16:09] <njd001> well it starts to load then just hangs

[16:10] <njd001> the vm i am trying to create
[16:10] <MonkeyDust> mojtaba  what llutz sais is better
[16:10] <zykotick9> ikonia: you might want to confirm with njd001 (i don't see there posts) that they have virt support in cpu (required by kvm) with command: cat /proc/cpuinfo | egrep '(vmx|svm)'
[16:10] <ikonia> zykotick9: a wise move always

[16:12] <patie> Pici: THANK YOU :) REALLY

[16:14] <drPoo> hi all, Im runnint 10.04 LTS on a headless server and I get the following when running df -h "100% /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs". Has anybody ran into this issue? I found this page http://www.somewhereville.com/?p=1370 telling me to "sudo mv /etc/init/ureadahead.conf /etc/init/ureadahead.conf.disable". Any ideas?
[16:15] <njd001> aha
[16:15] <njd001> ikonia the command kvm-ok verfied check box in the bios :)
[16:16] <njd001> i forgot to enable vt
[16:16] <njd001> that might help
[16:17] <njd001> apparently Lenovo moved the VT setting under security
[16:17] <g105b> I tried locking a Wine app to the launcher a year ago when Unity was new-ish, and it was difficult to make the launcher icon behave like an actual app (with running indicator, for example)... I tried again today and still not possible - anyone got a hack to make this behave properly?
[16:17] <njd001> ikonia does this mean i may have to recompile the kernel modules?
[16:17] <ikonia> njd001: no, just load the kernel module if your hardware supports it
[16:18] <njd001> it was disabled at the time of ubuntu 12.10 install
[16:18] <njd001> WHY Lenovo moved that under security is beyond me
[16:18] <ikonia> what was disabled ?
[16:19] <ikonia> VT support ?
[16:19] <njd001> yes
[16:19] <philinux> belgianguy: I bought logitech cos I knew it would work. Sorry cant be of any more help
[16:19] <ikonia> njd001: because it has security implications
[16:19] <pradeep_> after upgrading to linux-generic-image-3.5.0-22 my wirless stopped working

[16:19] <ikonia> njd001: allowing guests access to the host
[16:19] <njd001> ah yes
[16:20] <njd001> makes sense.
[16:20] <ikonia> so if you don't need it, why introduce a risk
[16:20] <ikonia> and if you do need it you should be aware enough to enable it
[16:20] <belgianguy> philinux: thanks, but this is just for a demonstration, if I buy hardware, I do, too, buy $RELIABE_BRAND

[16:26] <ikonia> njd001: never had a problem with the vmvga, but it depends on what you want/need
[16:27] <njd001> MonkeyDust yes i just realized this goes with the question i had yesterday about selection of video modules. I also noticed that my corporate ISO when it goes to install it does not see C:\
[16:27] <njd001> perhaps this will be fixed now with the module loaded..

[17:25] <njd001> prodnix thats a storage question and i can answer that you aren't missing anything
[17:25] <njd001> which raid did you do ?
[17:25] <iceman> getting the same error

[17:26] <njd001> prodnix which raid did you do 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/10/50
[17:27] <iceman> is there any way to do a force install of firefox?
[17:27] <prodnix> njd001: But I thought that was the point of RAID0
[17:27] <njd001> no
[17:27] <in^> @kostkon: no joy, must be chrome, because audio in everything else works fine
[17:27] <njd001> RAID 0 gives you space expansion over more than one disk and its not good unless you mirror it if you have a single disk failure you're screwed.
[17:27] <kostkon> in^, :(  you could try reinstalling it
[17:27] <in^> i did, gonna try to downgrade
[17:27] <ikonia> its not good if you mirror it either
[17:28] <njd001> RAID 0 is faster than all the other raids...but still

[17:31] <_raven> trying to setup a wlan acess point with hostapd and dnsmasq. anything is not right with the bridge between wlan0 and eth0 - need help please
[17:32] <prodnix> njd001: Ive spent a while looking into raid, I have 4 500G disk in LVM stripe and got insane improvements in bandwidth
[17:32] <disharmonic> hey
[17:32] <njd001> ok
[17:32] <njd001> this is SSD ?
[17:32] <iceman> any ideas why apt-get or aptitude failed to install firefox? i use the firefox tarball install and it runs fine.
[17:32] <prodnix> njd001: mechanical disks
[17:33] <njd001> spindles ok what rpm's are they and yes they should be identical disks if possible
[17:33] <disharmonic> iceman, unless you tell us the apt-get error noone can answer that
[17:34] <njd001> prodnix most raid controllers sync the spindle to prevent from becoming whats known as spindle bound.
[17:34] <prodnix> njd001: 7200RPM, 2 old samsungs and 2 newer WD's i think
[17:34] <njd001> oo yeah you dont want to do that
[17:34] <iceman> here is the error again i get near the end of the install again
[17:34] <njd001> your RAID 0 on all these drives?
[17:34] <adamk> iceman: Pastebin the *full* output of the command.
[17:34] <prodnix> njd001: yes, been running them for months without a problem
[17:35] <_raven> trying to setup a wlan acess point with hostapd and dnsmasq. anything is not right with the bridge between wlan0 and eth0 - need help please
[17:35] <iceman> ok
[17:35] <njd001> so what happens is the raid controller will look at all spindles and if the newer WD's are faster it will try to throttle them (at least a good RAID controller will) to match the lower speed of 7200 rpm
[17:35] <prodnix> and they massively vary is performance too, but its all junk data like games and redownloadable crap
[17:35] <njd001> yes it will
[17:35] <njd001> because your running multiple spindles in different RPMS
[17:35] <njd001> your getting whats called spindle bound.
[17:36] <prodnix> njd001: but these SSDs need to be firing on all 12 cylinders for my bcache testing
[17:36] <njd001> it means the disks are indepedent but if the buffers on them are different sizes or the spindle spins at a different rate than it won't keep up
[17:36] <iceman> here is error: http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2083237
[17:37] <prodnix> njd001: I run multiple windows VMs on my PC and host LANs with my mates and disk is a huge bottleneck
[17:37] <njd001> ok wait you just said you have 7200 RPM disks are you trying to raid SSD with 7200 RPM ?
[17:37] <prodnix> njd001: no
[17:37] <njd001> clarify please.
[17:37] <prodnix> njd001: seperate array
[17:37] <njd001> ok
[17:37] <njd001> what raid controller model are you using?

[17:38] <ClientAlive> I've been trying to find a solution to a particular piece of software on my system (running 12.04 server with gnome 3). I have Visual Paradigm Community Edition installed but it installs to my home directory (and I HATE that - hate'). So I think I've found an option but not sure I know enough to understand whether it will do what I want for me. Can someone please help me evaluate the option?
[17:38] <njd001> Are the disks all using the same raid controller... I'm familiar with caching and cascaded disk arrays.
[17:38] <ClientAlive> What I want is to install it to /opt/VPUML/

[17:40] <prodnix> njd001: I am am not running any controller, Im using the software raid in linux called mdadm
[17:40] <Miebster> will rm -rf /this/dir/*  follow symlinks in /this/dir/ and delete data that exists outside of /this/dir?
[17:40] <njd001> ok so your wanting the SSD to act as a prefetch to the actual RAID'ed disks the spindles.
[17:40] <prodnix> njd001: exactly :)
[17:40] <njd001> yep got it i sww that
[17:40] <njd001> see that.
[17:40] <njd001> lemme thnk about this for a second... brb
[17:40] <disharmonic> iceman is that acroread package from the official repos?
[17:40] <prodnix> njd001: tyvm :)
[17:40] <njd001> is going to his whiteboard to diagram it out...
[17:41] <iceman> i am not sure. how can i tell?
[17:41] <prodnix> njd001: lol
[17:41] <njd001> ok so your doing software raid (argh)
[17:41] <belgianguy> is there a way to get a binary dump from a webcam
[17:41] <belgianguy> it won't open in any of the tools I've consulted
[17:42] <belgianguy> from ffmpeg to mplayer, vlc, xawtv
[17:42] <prodnix> njd001: I know this sux but I have plenty of cores to go around so I dont mind the overhead
[17:42] <njd001> prodnix let me get back to my spindle question how many disks are in that raid and what raid format is it obviously your doing RAID 0 on the SSD's
[17:42] <teekoh> what can i use as a dynamic proxy forwarder? On one internal computer I want to connect to my internal proxy that looks up a proxy list and forwards my original request to the actual proxy in the list. IDEAS?
[17:43] <njd001> so the only way in any given RAID system that SSD works best is once the data is cached there but you still have to overcome the issue of spindles.
[17:43] <prodnix> njd001: they are all in the same array, RAID0 (I know its ballsy). 2 of them are around 30% slower than the other 2. the 2 slower drives also have half the cache.
[17:44] <njd001> then what your doing will not work
[17:44] <prodnix> njd001: I am totally up for suggestions too, I have enough space to backup
[17:44] <teekoh> in a raid, it only works as fast as your slowest piece of hardware
[17:44] <njd001> at least not that way
[17:44] <prodnix> njd001: at which level will it not work?
[17:44] <njd001> right
[17:45] <disharmonic> iceman, i did a quick search and there's no acroread pkg in 12.04 at least. The cmd apt-cache showpkg packagename should tell you more
[17:45] <njd001> prodnix heres the design change: you want to take the spidles of the same speed and put them each into its own raid group. rg1 and rg2
[17:45] <prodnix> teekoh: when I can dd almost 600MB/s I dont care :)
[17:45] <njd001> the SSD needs to be RG0

[17:46] <shark12342> Can u guys me if this is real
[17:46] <shark12342> macbook air for $170
[17:46] <adamk> iceman: Because dpkg thinks there is /usr/lib/firefox/plugins/, and it thinks this was installed by some acroread package you managed to install somehow.
[17:46] <iceman> iam using v12.10. an upgrade from 12.04 to 12.10
[17:46] <adamk> iceman: So remove the acorread package.

[17:47] <njd001> otherwise what your trying to do is pair a Ferarri engine in a Chevy Chevette with 10 people stuffed in the car.

[17:47] <njd001> i just said it :)
=== yan is now known as Bush
[17:47] <iceman> let me search for acroread package and remove it.
[17:47] <disharmonic> xangua, hmm i should have those enabled
[17:47] <njd001> you create a volume that sits on the spindles as two raid groups paired oon disk speed.
[17:48] <ortix> hi guys, i'm having a little trouble running cron
[17:48] <prodnix> so the finished product will be using 2 arrays? instead of 1 big 1?
[17:48] <ortix> i can't seem to run commands and i can't figure out how to even check if it ran
=== nuxninja is now known as fart-ternator
[17:48] <njd001> then you create one raid group for the SSD's that are independent from the spindle (they act as a front load cache) to the spindles.
[17:48] <vinyl> hey guys do any of you guys know were i can find the mouse write file?
[17:48] <ortix> all I want to do is run flexget every 30 minutes
[17:49] <njd001> normally you would never do this as a software driven raid
[17:49] <njd001> you really need a HW Raid controller to do this right.
[17:49] <prodnix> ok, I suppose with the cache I wont need the spindle bandwidth
[17:49] <prodnix> makes sense
[17:49] <njd001> no you dont its slowing you down.... actually its Mocking you and "laughing" in a way
[17:49] <prodnix> njd001: hehe
[17:50] <njd001> because the SSD's have to act as the same speed of a 7200 rpm disk.
[17:50] <Padd_> hi is there someone here that can help with a question regarding adding a user to sudo ?
[17:50] <prodnix> njd001: well I only got the SSDs today so my huge spindle bandwidth served me well up until now
[17:50] <njd001> look at the designs of some of the best storage arrays in the world..EMC, NTAP, storageTEK
[17:51] <prodnix> njd001: I am very interested in zfs but Im not forking out for the slc ssd's
[17:51] <root____1> I'm installing tftpd on ubuntu 11.04 http://www.davidsudjiman.info/2006/03/27/installing-and-setting-tftpd-in-ubuntu/comment-page-4/#comment-94631 from this page and it's not working...I don't see any ports listening
[17:51] <njd001> the logic is that when you use SSD as a flashCACHE when you pull a file in from the spindle it loads to the SSD the metadata gets tagged so that it rarely has to talk to the disk and only provide the delta in data change to write to disk.
[17:51] <prodnix> njd001: hope bcache will fill the gap and not have to spend a fortune
[17:51] <vinyl> nvm i found it :3
[17:52] <njd001> the only time it has to reflush the SSD (flashcache) is if you blob big data through it and it flushes your cached data.
[17:52] <prodnix> njd001: Am I heading in the right direction with my hardware?
[17:53] <prodnix> njd001: will it suffice for my project? :)
[17:53] <njd001> yes well RAID cards can suck too because they normally come with a tiny spec of memory about 512 MB thats used for metadata tagging for the location of data on a spindle or SSD
[17:53] <njd001> yes.
[17:53] <jrib> !11.04 | root____1
[17:53] <prodnix> njd001: thank you for your help
[17:53] <ubottu> root____1: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) was the fourteenth release of Ubuntu. Desktop support ended on October 28, 2012. See !upgrade, !lts and !eol for more details.
[17:53] <iceman> thanks guys! acroread was the root cause of the problem. not sure how or when the acroread got install
[17:53] <prodnix> njd001: much appreciated
[17:53] <root____1> so i should upgrad
[17:54] <jrib> root____1: your priority should be to upgrade to a supported release.  You're not receiving security updates on 11.04
[17:54] <qhartman> I've been having consistent problems with Remmina killing my window manager on 12.04
[17:54] <njd001> some of the largest PetaByte Netapp filers use 7200 rpm 1-2-3 TB disks but set 1-2TB PCI 3.0 slotted SSD in front of the spindle.
[17:54] <qhartman> Anyone else seen this?
[17:54] <prodnix> njd001: which software cache should i be focusing on?
[17:54] <root____1> is there an alternate tftpd since I can't get this working?
[17:54] <prodnix> njd001: u mention flashcache
[17:55] <prodnix> njd001: Ive heard a lot of good stuff about bcache
[17:55] <njd001> prodnix flashCACHE is just the name netapp gives its 2 TB PCI slotted card that sits in a PCI 3.0 busline (they are about 30,000 dollars on a filer implimentation)

[17:56] <jrib> root____1: you just want an ftp server?
[17:56] <prodnix> njd001: ah, the benchmark i read compared against software called flashcache, hence the confusion
[17:56] <njd001> bcache is just a software implimentation of Cache I/O that most storage companies use HW to do it it most likely runs a form of bcache thats embedded in the PCI card.
[17:57] <prodnix> njd001: awesome, learning more from u than hours of googling :D
[17:58] <root____1> tftp so I can back up my cisco images
[17:58] <prodnix> njd001: filled me with confidence and enthusiasm
[17:58] <njd001> prodnix when you do SAN and NAS storage for a long time you become an expert. even if you dont want to be.
[17:59] <jrib> root____1: I don't know then.  My suggestion would be to see if the problem persists after you upgrade and if so, come back and troubleshoot
[17:59] <njd001> has seen whole corporations become spindle bound even in a netapp or emc array because of lack of proper configuration it can be entertaining. Glad i could help.
[18:00] <chimeracoder> I
[18:00] <prodnix> njd001: Legend! :)
[18:00] <chimeracoder> I'm having trouble creating installation media for Ubuntu 12.10 for use alongside OS X Lion - any suggested approach?
[18:00] <prodnix> bye all
[18:00] <njd001> hardly.
[18:00] <njd001> but ok :)
[18:00] <prodnix> :)
[18:01] <jrib> chimeracoder: which .iso are you using?
[18:01] <chimeracoder> I've tried creating the USB on OS X, but it doesn't seem to be working with unetbootin either
[18:01] <chimeracoder> jrib: I've tried with a couple of different isos
[18:01] <jrib> chimeracoder: which ones? :)
[18:01] <chimeracoder> right now I'm using the 32 bit one that I downloaded off of the main site; before that I tried with xubuntu and also with the one htat unetbootin downloads automatically
=== nuxninja is now known as jignes-babu
[18:01] <chimeracoder> on OS X I had to convert it to a dmg or img first, but that didn't work either
[18:01] <root____1> okay jrib
[18:02] <jrib> chimeracoder: there are special ISOs for macs. You can find them here: http://releases.ubuntu.com/
[18:02] <jrib> !mac | chimeracoder
[18:02] <ubottu> chimeracoder: For help on installing and using Ubuntu on a mac, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages
[18:02] <PsyMar> OK, I'm getting desperate -- I have tried "solutions" on installing wine from about 10 different websites, and none have helped
[18:03] <PsyMar> I'm trying to install wine on Ubuntu 12.10 x64
[18:03] <jrib> PsyMar: sudo apt-get install wine  (done)
[18:03] <PsyMar> and I keep getting a dependency error
[18:03] <PsyMar> done that twenty times, jrib
[18:03] <jrib> PsyMar: pastebin the error
[18:03] <chimeracoder> jrib: as for creating the USB, though, how do I do that on OS X? or do I do that on a Linux machine with unetbootin, etc.?
[18:04] <jrib> chimeracoder: I don't know what the recommended way is on OS X.  I believe you can use unetbootin, or usb-creator-gtk (only Linux I think), or even dd.  I'll send you the install wiki page
[18:04] <jrib> !install | chimeracoder
[18:04] <ubottu> chimeracoder: Ubuntu can be installed in lots of ways. Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation for documentation. Problems during install? See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CommonProblemsInstall - Don't want to use a CD? See http://tinyurl.com/3exghs - See also !automate
[18:05] <chimeracoder> jrib: yeah, I tried that yesterday, but rEFIt wasn't recognizing it
[18:05] <PsyMar> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566749/
[18:06] <jrib> chimeracoder: you could also just burn a dvd.  I've never used a usb to install on a mac so I can't tell you for sure what to do
[18:06] <chimeracoder> jrib: the interwebs seemed to suggest that Lion+ has some issues, but supposedly it can still be done
[18:06] <chimeracoder> jrib: no, this is a MBA
[18:06] <chimeracoder> no CD/DVD drive
[18:07] <jrib> chimeracoder: so you used the +mac iso yesterday?
[18:07] <chimeracoder> jrib: yup
[18:07] <jrib> chimeracoder: with unetbootin?
[18:08] <chimeracoder> jrib: no, I didn't have my Linux computer with me yesterday, so I tried Disk Utility and dd (on the mac)
[18:08] <chimeracoder> one of which required me to create a dmg/img first (some websites pointed to that)
=== nuxninja is now known as jignes-babu
[18:09] <jrib> chimeracoder: I'd give unetbootin a try then unless the docs point you elsewhere
[18:10] <chimeracoder> jrib: alright, will try
[18:10] <PsyMar> jrib: pastebinned my wine installation error. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566749/

[18:11] <jrib> PsyMar: pastebin output of "apt-cache policy wine1.4"
[18:12] <Vivekananda> Hello everyone. I am trying to install emacs 24 into ubuntu lucid but not successful yet. The second problem is  I am also getting error messages after running apt get update. Could I request someone to look into it. The result of the apt-get update command and sources list is here --- http://pastebin.com/iShcJSuU
[18:13] <PsyMar> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1566771/
[18:13] <leilaneforever> ciao
[18:14] <katsumeblisk> Vivekananda: It seems like one of your PPAs doesn't exist.
[18:14] <katsumeblisk> Vivekananda: At least for 10.04.
[18:14] <jrtappers> How do I set ubuntu to use integrated graphics and a graphics card?
[18:15] <katsumeblisk> jrtappers: Desktop or Laptop? What brand of video card?
[18:15] <vfw> s
[18:15] <Vivekananda> katsumeblisk: which one is it ? I mean which line should I delete ( from the pastebin sources file ?
[18:16] <jrtappers> Desktop,  AMD, it works on win 7, so not a hw problem
[18:16] <katsumeblisk> Vivekananda: You could use the Software Sources GUI (found in Synaptic's menus) and remove whatever olivier-berten is.
[18:16] <katsumeblisk> Vivekananda: It's saying it can't find that repo for Lucid.
[18:16] <jrib> PsyMar: run "sudo apt-get update" before we do anything else and confirm that wine1.4-i386 is still not available.  If so, what is the output of "dpkg --print-foreign-architectures"
[18:17] <chimeracoder> jrib: should it be on /dev/sdb or /dev/sdb1?
[18:17] <Vivekananda> so isnt the same line present in /apt/sources.list ??
=== MartinS is now known as Guest75982
[18:17] <jrtappers> katsumeblisk, Ubuntu 12.10
[18:17] <Vivekananda> I thought is should be right ??
[18:17] <katsumeblisk> Vivekananda: I didn't see it.
[18:17] <katsumeblisk> jrtappers: That's not what I asked.
[18:17] <jrib> chimeracoder: don't know.  I would guess /dev/sdb though (make sure that's actually your usb of course)
[18:17] <jrtappers> <jrtappers> Desktop,  AMD, it works on win 7, so not a hw problem
[18:17] <katsumeblisk> jrtappers: Oh
[18:17] <katsumeblisk> jrtappers: Make sure you mention who you're talking to or it gets missed.
[18:18] <chimeracoder> jrib: unetbootin doesn't give me an option for /dev/sdb - just /dev/sdb1, that's why I ask
[18:18] <jrtappers> katsumeblisk, ok
[18:18] <chimeracoder> on Arch, I remember that /dev/sdb1 wouldn't work, though
[18:18] <katsumeblisk> jrtappers: I can't really help then. Sorry. I know a bit about laptops with optimus graphics switching between Intel and nVidia.
[18:18] <chimeracoder> but then again, the Arch Wiki page says that that same method won't work with UEFI, so I don't know if that's even valid here, since I'm using rEFIt
[18:18] <katsumeblisk> jrtappers: Why do you want to use both?
[18:18] <PsyMar> jrib: I could've sworn I ran sudo apt-get update about 5 times by now, but this time it's installing, thanks
[18:19] <jrib> PsyMar: cool
[18:19] <jrtappers> katsumeblisk, I have 3 screens, 2 off graphics, one of integrated. The REALLY odd thing is that screen 3 shows the shutdown animation, nothing else
[18:20] <Nasser> hi
[18:21] <_methods> jrtappers: have you gotten the integrated to work at all?
[18:21] <katsumeblisk> jrtappers: This may help. I just Google'd it. I can't really do much else. Sorry. http://askubuntu.com/questions/108758/runt-integrated-intel-graphics-card-nvidia-pcie-graphics-card
[18:21] <Eldrek> hi im trying to install ubuntu for the first time, but the screen just goes black when I select install from grub
[18:21] <Vivekananda> katsumeblisk: After removing the line I get a new error .Weird ---http://pastebin.com/HptJ96TM
[18:21] <PsyMar> Eldrek: are you on a laptop?
[18:21] <Eldrek> yes
[18:21] <PsyMar> do you have a brightness key on your keyboard/
[18:21] <PsyMar> if so, turn up the brightness, that worked for me
[18:22] <jrtappers> _methods, It works on 7, and it shows the shutdown animation, the rest of the time it shows black screen, but not in sleep, so it is getting told to show a black screen
[18:22] <Eldrek> yes, but the backlight was on
[18:22] <PsyMar> Eldrek: The darkest setting on linux is not "dark" but "completely black"
[18:22] <PsyMar> at least, on the version of ubuntu and the computer I have
[18:22] <_methods> jrtappers: hrmm i've got 4 mon i'm trying to get working
[18:22] <_methods> haven't found much about getting more than 2 running
[18:22] <Eldrek> so its normal for the backlight to be on with no image on screen?
[18:22] <PsyMar> I had the same problem, turning up brightness worked
[18:22] <PsyMar> I don't know if that's "normal" but that's what happened to me
[18:22] <Eldrek> ok ill try and report back
[18:23] <Eldrek> my only brightness key is fn + arrows though does that matter
[18:24] <jrtappers> Ok, secondly, how do I set up an ssh server to only allow reverse ssh connections, nothing else?
[18:24] <Rishabh_> .help
[18:25] <chimeracoder> jrib: still doesn't work
[18:25] <Industrial> Is there a list of services the Unity environment starts? I would like my window manager set up to be as compatible as possible. Right now I have unstyled gtk for example ...
[18:25] <chimeracoder> 'Non system disk - Press any key to reboot'
[18:25] <PsyMar> Eldrek: doubt it matters
[18:25] <Nasser> the weather indicator crashes when searching for location, any suggestion? or if there i any similar app?

[18:25] <vfw> Industrial: service
[18:26] <Rishabh_> Ditto for the weather app.
[18:26] <Industrial> vfw: yes, service.
[18:27] <Nasser> thank you
[18:27] <ranman> why did I join this channel?
[18:27] <vfw> Industrial: service --status-all
[18:27] <Industrial> ah.
[18:27] <PsyMar> ranman: in your IRC client's defaults?
[18:27] <jrib> chimeracoder: there are some fairly explicit instructions here http://maketecheasier.com/install-ubuntu-12-10-in-macbook-air/2012/11/08 .  Is this what you tried yesterday?
[18:27] <vfw> Industrial: See man service
[18:27] <evon> How do I get Ubuntu to add a program I downloaded to add it to the lens and put an icon in the sidebar.  Right now I'm running the program from a directory in my Downloads folder
[18:27] <chimeracoder> jrib: yes
[18:28] <Industrial> vfw, this is not at desktop level. The system still does this if I am in i3wm, not Unity.
[18:28] <jrib> chimeracoder: ah, I guess that's mostly the same as https://help.ubuntu.com/community/How%20to%20install%20Ubuntu%20on%20MacBook%20using%20USB%20Stick .  What happens when you try to use it?
[18:28] <Industrial> in i3wm my GTK looks is ugly as hell
[18:29] <shukty> HI, i ve a prob. with my 12.10 x64 and driver ati. I m using a laptop and till now np , but today my ati config set my resolution to 4000*4000 and it s kinda impossible 'due i m sure my lapt it s quite ancient and ... how can i set it manually ? tnx dudes
[18:29] <Industrial> so what do I need to set up to make it look like in Unity
[18:29] <Industrial> Node scrollbars, etc.
[18:29] <vfw> evon: First, I would suggest moving it somewhere else
[18:29] <njd001> !justask
[18:29] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[18:29] <Industrial> Nice*
[18:29] <njd001> :D
[18:29] <Eldrek> ok, brightness didn't fix it
[18:29] <njd001> i like that !
[18:29] <vfw> evon: What application is it?
[18:29] <evon> vfm what folder would be ideal?
[18:29] <Vivekananda> anone ??
[18:29] <evon> vfm: Aptana Studio
[18:29] <zykotick9> Eldrek: have you tried nomodeset?
[18:30] <vfw> evon: /opt/
[18:30] <jrib> Industrial: probably running gnome-settings-daemon will do it... if you don't mind running gnome-settings-daemon.  I just setup ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini and ~/.gtkrc-2.0
[18:30] <Eldrek> zykotick9 I tried typing it in the grub parameters
[18:30] <Vivekananda>  Anyone can take a look at my files and tell me why even google download is giving error in the sources file. This is sources for ubuntu lucid and I am runnig apt-get update --- http://pastebin.com/HptJ96TM
[18:30] <peeps[work]> does anyone here know if i can connect from ubuntu to windows via remote desktop "With Network Level Authentication"
[18:30] <zykotick9> Eldrek: ok.  just checking.
[18:30] <PsyMar> Eldrek: how much RAM does your computer have?
[18:30] <Eldrek> zykotick9 is that the correct way?
[18:30] <Eagleman> Can i chroot a user to a directory and allow it to use scp?
[18:31] <zykotick9> !nomodeset > Eldrek
[18:31] <ubottu> Eldrek, please see my private message
[18:31] <vfw> evon: And then put a symlink to the executable someplace like /usr/bin
[18:32] <peeps[work]> i am setting up my windows to enable remote desktop, and there are two options, just not sure if ubuntu supports the more secure one.  "Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop"   or "Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication"
[18:32] <vfw> evon: sudo ln -s /opt/newapp/my-new-app-executable /usr/bin/
[18:32] <vfw> evon: Just make sure it is unique in name
[18:33] <vfw> evon: ... that the command name does not already exist on your system...
[18:33] <Eldrek> PsyMar 8gb ram
[18:33] <evon> VFM ok i did all that using nautilus
[18:34] <jrib> vfw, evon: good idea to use /usr/local/bin for things you install yourself imo
[18:34] <Eldrek> zykotick9 I've been to the page the bot linked me, but it doesn't seem to say how to put the command in?
[18:34] <jrib> Eagleman: yes, search "man sshd_config" for chroot
[18:34] <vfw> jrib: Good point.
[18:34] <ioria> peeps[work]: may that is valid only for Win remote desk... i'm not sure
[18:35] <vfw> evon: jrib ... but no big deal either way.
[18:35] <zykotick9> Eldrek: i'm pretty sure it must be... if it's from the livecd i have no idea, from grub you can use 'e' to edit a line (for a one time test)
[18:36] <Eldrek> alright, that's what I did. it didn't do anything different though
[18:36] <vfw> evon: As jrib suggests, it would be a bit more proper to place the symlink in /usr/local/bin (as long as it's in your path), (less crowded there too).
[18:36] <evon> vfm jrib. ok I will move it there
[18:37] <vfw> jrib: Thank you for the correction/constructive criticism
[18:37]  * jrib nods
[18:38] <Vivekananda> hello
[18:38] <Eldrek> is there nothing else I can try?
[18:38] <Eagleman> jrib, the thing is is that i cannot use scp:  This service allows sftp connections only.
[18:38] <VlanX> I'm trying to umount a remote NFS folder, but nautilus tells me /media/Server was not found in /proc/mounts.  What can i do?
[18:39] <evon> vfm jrib. is making a link using nautilus the same as making a symling?
[18:39] <jrib> evon: yes
[18:39] <evon> vfm jrib. Ok I did all that. So will the lense pick it up now?
[18:39] <vfw> evon: I never used nautilus for that purpose, (good to know it works...)
[18:40] <vfw> evon: lense?
[18:40] <jrib> Eagleman: the man page says you need to provide certain things (like a shehll and some /dev nodes) if you want more than sftp.  I guess that includes scp too. Did you do that?
[18:40] <bizhan_> HI the current LTS release of Ubuntu is 12.04, what would be the next release version? Thx
[18:40] <ioria> Eldrek: are you having "Cannot display this video mode" ?
[18:40] <vfw> bizhan_: Hint:  2 years apart
[18:40] <evon> vfm jrib. In unity when you press the windows button. You are able to search for apps by typing the name
[18:40] <bizhan_> vfw: 14.04 thx
[18:41] <evon> vfm jrib. I also want it to show up in the sidebar (ubuntu 12.04)
[18:41] <Eldrek> ioria: when I try to select anything in grub the screen just goes black afterward, I'm not seeing any errors
[18:41] <jrib> evon: I've only used unity for about 2 minutes so I can't help much with that
[18:41] <evon> jrib: gosh darnit
[18:42] <ioria> Eldrek: you can enter in grub but the system doesn't start , correct ?
[18:42] <Eldrek> yes
[18:42] <vfw> evon: I have only limited exerience with Unity as well, and I use Alt-F2 alot
[18:42] <bizhan_> question, is there a plan for integration of the systemd into Ubuntu? Thx
[18:42] <MO_Handes> what is a good editor for php? I want something like gedit that hase auto-indent and automatically insert tabs
[18:43] <jrib> evon: I've seen that question answered here before, so you can stick around and wait for someone to show up.  I think people drag icons into the sidebar somehow but it may require a .desktop file to already exist -- not really sure
[18:44] <ioria> Eldrek: you can try to modify the boot option erasing voices regarding the video mode
[18:44] <Eldrek> what does that mean
[18:44] <BillyZane2> hahaha, i love xfce
[18:44] <Eldrek> I've done nomodeset if that's what you mean
[18:45] <vfw> evon: I'm an xfce user
[18:45] <ioria> Eldrek: do you remember the boot option full line that you are modifying ?
[18:46] <Eldrek> I typed nomodeset after
[18:46] <Eldrek> after 'quiet splash'
[18:46] <evon> vfm oh ok. I will keep searchin then
[18:46] <ioria> Eldrek: yes, that's a way
[18:47] <ioria> Eldrek: but you can also erasing others parameters
[18:47] <ioria> erase
[18:47] <Eldrek> what should I erase
[18:48] <addi> hey guys, does the WUBI installer for Ubuntu 12.10 not work on Windows 8? fails to open for me :X
[18:48] <fm> what is the name of the compiz plugin that allows me to maximize a window by dragging it to the edge?
[18:48] <Eldrek> addi I have found that wubi doesn't work with UEFI
[18:48] <ioria> Eldrek:can you paste the line ?
[18:49] <MonkeyDust> addi  do'nt try wubi, you'll get frustrated
[18:49] <orudie> is there an equivalent to a ctrl+alt+del key in ubuntu ?
[18:49] <addi> Eldrek, custom built PC with Windows 8 installed separately. still UEFI? :P
[18:49] <ultreia> uefi is part of the bios
[18:49] <Eldrek> I have no idea in that case addi, thats just my experience with my laptop
[18:50] <vfw> addi: Not sure if it does or not, but I would recomend a real insall, either on a USB drive or an internal one. wubi is ok, sort of and sort of not so ok, it's just for demo purposes IMO
[18:50] <katsumeblisk> addi: Most mobos come with UEFI.
[18:50] <katsumeblisk> addi: At least new ones.
[18:50] <Eldrek> ioria I will rejoin irc from my phone and send you the line
[18:50] <katsumeblisk> addi: UEFI != Secure Boot
[18:50] <addi> ah, right, UEFI = graphical BIOS
[18:50] <addi> got confused, sorry
[18:51] <addi> okay, will install via USB then, thanks
[18:51] <addi> just that I've installed Mint a lot of times through WUBI, so wanted to make sure if Windows 8 was the problem
[18:51] <Eagleman> jrib, i doubt that will work, becuase it only allows sftp connections somehow
[18:52] <jrib> Eagleman: doubt what will work?
[18:52] <vfw> katsumeblisk: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting
[18:52] <katsumeblisk> vfw: Why are you telling me this?
[18:52] <katsumeblisk> vfw: I didn't ask for help.
[18:52] <vfw> addi: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting
[18:52] <Eagleman> jrib:  (like a shehll and some /dev nodes) if you want more than sftp.  I guess that includes scp too. Did you do that?
[18:53] <Vivekananda> hey katsumeblisk howdy
[18:53] <Vivekananda> I thought you had gone
[18:53] <jrib> Eagleman: yes, what about it?

[18:54] <Eagleman> jrib, i havent found a way to use scp with ForceCommand internal-sftp
[18:55] <jrib> Eagleman: ok, but this is a different question
[18:55] <Eagleman> jrib, this is exactly the same question: Can i chroot a user to a directory and allow it to use scp?
[18:55] <Eldrek> Who wanted my grub parameters? Can't find you in the list
[18:55] <vfw> Vivekananda: May be that you have a malformed URL in sources.list
[18:55] <jrib> Eagleman: you don't need ForceCommand to do that
[18:55] <Eagleman> the chrooting part works, however scp wont work
[18:55] <jwtiyar> i cant comment,share post, with ff inn linux(ubuntu)
[18:56] <jrib> Eagleman: well, can you ssh in and get a shell?
[18:56] <Eagleman> no
[18:56] <jrib> Eagleman: so make that work first and my guess is that then you can scp too

[19:00] <jhutchins> orudie: Same thing if you can access it via ssh.
[19:00] <disharmonic> MonkeyDust, apparently XBMC from a PPA needed dist-upgrade. Strange

[19:09] <jgcampbell300> ultreia, I have had this thought ... maybe versioning would help in combo with regular backups
[19:09] <Eldrek> #android? Your Nick needs to be registered there iirc
[19:09] <jrib> Eagleman: there's some discussion here: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/9853/restricting-an-ssh-scp-sftp-user-to-a-directory One thing they mention is that scponly has a "scponlyc" variant that also allows for chroot.  That may be easier for you to setup; you may want to look further into it

[19:10] <Eldrek> No problem adeeb
[19:10] <jgcampbell300> ultreia, of corse the vpn would make it pretty secure wouldnt it ... if i set it up to only be opened from the 3 ips setup so basicly the only connections accepted is the three locations and a admin computer off site

[19:28] <jgcampbell300> ultreia, i like that thought ... have seen other peoples networks setup like that

[19:48] <test12378> let me check
[19:49] <toms_> Hi everyone! I am new there. I wante ask about xubuntu..what is terminal? and why we need terminal?
[19:49] <NielsMkn> I have made a shell script and I want to run it directly by double-clicking instead of clicking run in the message box with options (Run in terminal, display, run )
[19:50] <jhutchins> toms_: You need the terminal to learn the command line interface and becomre computer literate.  It gives you much more powerful control of the computer and is essential for advanced configuration and troubleshooting.
[19:50] <ultreia> test12378; it's a problem of google chrome using the wrong intl code page. you'll notice that text rendered by the system is ok
[19:50] <jhutchins> toms_: It is more convenient that switching to the virtual consoles when you are already working in X.
[19:51] <jhutchins> ultreia: For me it extended to all menus.
[19:52] <ultreia> jhutchins; I'm looking at the same sceencap everyone else is looking at
[19:52] <jhutchins> test12378: As far as I can figure either one of the common font files was corrupt (possibly as distributed) or something is corrupting that portion of the video memory.
[19:52] <jhutchins> test12378: Are you completely up-to-date with all packages?
[19:53] <test12378> it is an intel chipset but i dont know how to paste into the ctrl+alt+f1 terminal
[19:53] <toms_> thanks.
[19:53] <test12378> i will have to come back in a couple of hours if you guys are still here though, i have class.
[19:53] <jhutchins> test12378: You can use lynx or pastebinit, or install gdm for a console mouse.
[19:53] <jhutchins> test12378: I don't remember if it went away when I updated or just when I switched to xfce.
[19:53] <ultreia> jhutchins; looking at it, at least half the screen is in normal font, and it's systematically divided into what is in the right font vs what is in the wrong

[19:56] <jhutchins> toms_: aptitide search weather?
[19:56] <ArmoredDragoon> the samsung ones in particular are very good
[19:56] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: why those in particular?
[19:56] <ultreia> ArmoredDragoon; by sdx is more flexible, unless you plan on it being the system drive
[19:56] <ArmoredDragoon> some SSD's have had issues of varying sorts
[19:57] <ArmoredDragoon> OCZ, even intel ones
[19:57] <ArmoredDragoon> samsung in my experience though has been flawless
[19:57] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: it's no problem having the root mounted on an ssd?
[19:57] <ArmoredDragoon> which may be due to the fact that samsung makes ALL of the parts, whereas other OEM's have different people make different parts
[19:57] <ArmoredDragoon> I can't think of any issues with it, I have two systems running root on an SSD
[19:57] <ultreia> ArmoredDragoon; does zfs provide uid for a mount command to use?
[19:58] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: what's the boot time like?
[19:58] <toms_> I search weather desktop for xubuntu

[19:59] <TechSmurf> md array, no controller
[20:00] <_Trullo> 14x2.. I thought 7 was optimal on a raid6 setup?
[20:00] <hilo> Okay so I came in here asking about masking passwords in a bash script, and MonkeyDust directed me to #bash. Over in #bash, they basically told me NO do not pass passwords as arguments ever. They recommended using a credentials file backed on a ram based filesystem. What is the best filesystem on ubuntu to use for this purpose? Also, in general, can anyone elaborate on the risks of doing so, or using a filesystem that is persistent
[20:00] <hilo> (since this is the recommended way of mounting samba from /etc/fstab as far as I can tell)?
=== |AHaKuH| is now known as AHaKuH
[20:01] <ArmoredDragoon> ultreia: right now I'm looking at doing "zpool create vol0 raidz /dev/sda /dev/sdb /dev/sdc /dev/sdd" but can the order of those disks change?
[20:01] <TechSmurf> _Trullo: I've seen a fair bit of argument about optimal array geometry, but either way I'm not looking for crazy performance, just sane performance
[20:01] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: I'm comparing drives, and the samsung ones seem rather overpriced, twice as much as this adata disk, but a lot slower on write.
[20:01] <ArmoredDragoon> I don't know how linux keeps track of that
[20:02] <ultreia> ArmoredDragoon; usually drive order doesn't randomly change
[20:02] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: it's rather similar to memory really, some brands are finicky compared to others
[20:02] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: I've never had any trouble with el-cheapo memory either :P
[20:02] <dbrom_> hello : at the moment I am using tar to compress folders that are betweek .5 TB to almost 4 TB . I would like to split the tar.ball and limit the size to .5 TB
[20:02] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: it seems like a rather stark difference though
[20:03] <dpurgert> dbrom_, tar doens't inherently compress (though, you can zip as an option)...
[20:03] <ultreia> ArmoredDragoon; what is recommended as "best" is using a "zpool" with a zconf file to specify the order of the zdisks
[20:03] <ArmoredDragoon> ultreia: the ZFS page says you should only use /dev/sdX for test builds, but /dev/by-id for a daily driver, only thing is by-id means you have to change it should a disk fail and you need to replace
[20:03] <ArmoredDragoon> hmm
[20:03] <TechSmurf> Right now I'm only getting 476 iops across 10GbE iscsi
[20:03] <dbrom_> im using tar -cvzf
[20:03] <BluesKaj> altker128, check your package manager , make sure your repos are enabled , or open a terminal and do sudo apt-get update
[20:03] <in^> @kostkon: didn't trust the d/l site to d/g so switched to Chromium :-)
[20:04] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: yeah it sometimes comes down to which brand you prefer, though I am on my first samsung 840 pro and I've found it leagues ahead of anything else I've had
[20:04] <in^> @kostkon: all is well
[20:04] <dpurgert> dbrom_, right, but I don't thing you get an option of how the gzip running alongside the tar is going to chunk the tarball
[20:04] <Doxin> hmm'
[20:04] <BluesKaj> in^, no need for @ on irc
[20:04] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: my first SSD was intel, second one was patriot, third was OCZ, and my fourth samsung
[20:04] <in^> habit :-)
[20:04] <dbrom_> What do I do then
[20:05] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: best way to research this IMO is to look at reviews on amazon and newegg
[20:05] <dpurgert> easier solution would be tar -cvf tar.ball (stuff)
[20:05] <Doxin> hmm
[20:05] <dpurgert> then gzip with whatever option to chunk the tarball at 512 MB
[20:05] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: looking at a local equivalent of those
[20:05] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: make sure to peruse the negative reviews especially, as murphy's law always hits somebody, and when it does they voice their opinions loudly
[20:06] <Doxin> true
[20:06] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: I understand, no need to buy from there though, just read their reviews
[20:06] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: I'm going with the samsung one though, it's not as if I can't afford it.
=== sylwester is now known as Guest76604
[20:06] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: I used to do that, buy local but read reviews online to see if there are any problems
[20:06] <dbrom_> can i just sub gzip in for tar where tar -cvzf folder  folder.tar.gz
[20:07] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: still buying online, just avoiding $50 in shipping costs or whatever insane amount they charge.
[20:07] <altker128> BluesKaj: Repos are enabled, but I think the repos need to be pointed some place else (i.e. "long term archived")
[20:07] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: e.g. hit your local frys/microcenter/tiger, find the model in your price range, then use your smartphone or just write down the model and look it up on newegg/amazon
[20:08] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: what country you live in?
[20:08] <zykotick9> altker128: fyi, 10.04 is Lucid.  Maverick is EOL i believe.
[20:08] <dpurgert> dbrom_, what're you trying to do exactly?  I mean, why're you needing/wanting to make ~500MB chunks?
[20:08] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: netherlands, import taxes get insane rather quickly, especially with fedex tacking on an additional €10
[20:08] <abailarri> Does anyone here have managed to install gnome shell extensions? I get an error when accessing the web extensions, and I have the latest version of Gnome3

[20:09] <ultreia> dbrom_ - you can at least use dd to split files
[20:09] <dbrom_> I have 5 TB of data that Id like to compress down into X number of 400GB files
[20:09] <BluesKaj> altker128, pointed someplace else ? , check your /etc/apt/sources.list , maybe pastebin it so we can see what's happening
[20:09] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: but ya the browse the reviews extensively, I'm leary of buying *anything* online myself
[20:09] <Guest76604> hello
[20:09] <dbrom_> what would the command look like
[20:09] <dpurgert> dbrom_, OK, but _why_ the size limit?
[20:10] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: the return policy on this site isn't too bad, sure it costs you €5 in shipping, but it works.
[20:10] <dbrom_> so I have an idea .... when I search it tells me I am able to do splitting with TAR
[20:10] <ArmoredDragoon> Doxin: newegg and amazon both are good sources of reviews IMO, just hit them and then buy from your place of choice
[20:10] <llutz> dbrom_: tar -cpz /whatever | split -d -b 400G mybackup.tar.gz
[20:10] <dbrom_> hard drive size
[20:10] <ArmoredDragoon> anyways I'm off to create a raid-5 array
[20:10] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: hmm
[20:10] <dbrom_> tried that doesnt work
[20:10] <zykotick9> dbrom_: compressing large files like that (gz) is a good way to loose the entire thing...
[20:11] <altker128> zykotick9: Sorry, you're right.  So are the Maverick repos offline?
[20:11] <ultreia> dbrom_ - something like "dd if=infile of=outfile-n iseek=n count=n"
[20:11] <oliver_g2> hello
[20:11] <dbrom_> what do you think i should you then
[20:11] <zykotick9> altker128: yes, see "/msg ubottu eol" for upgrade details.  i'd fresh install if i where you.
[20:11] <oliver_g2> how can I hide my chat status, so that it doesn't go to Unavailable if the screensaver kicks in?
[20:11] <altker128> zykotick9: I don't want to upgrade right now, I just need to install some stuff from repos
[20:11] <oliver_g2> (in 12.04, with Empathy)
[20:12] <Doxin> ArmoredDragoon: that reminds me, better check if I even have any spare drive bays :P
[20:12] <dpurgert> llutz, spiffy, I just ran across that myself -- kind of a pain to stitch it back together though
[20:12] <zykotick9> altker128: 'cause using unsupported software is a great idea.
[20:12] <jrtappers> Hello, how do I set up a limited user for reverse SSH only?
[20:12] <ultreia> dbrom_ - for appropriate values of n, that should work
[20:12] <altker128> zykotick9: I agree with you, but right now I don't have time to change everything.
[20:12] <dpurgert> dbrom_, OK ... I don't follow  -- you have ~5T of data that you need to cram onto a 400G drive?!

[20:14] <BluesKaj> altker128, your sources should still be available til April
[20:14] <zykotick9> BluesKaj: for maverick... i don't think so.
[20:14] <BluesKaj> zykotick9, read above
[20:14] <ultreia> dbrom_; does that dd command line look like a start?
[20:14] <llutz> dbrom_: anyway, using tar-gzip is dangerous. a single broken bit will make most of the data ... gone
[20:15] <dpurgert> dbrom_, yeah ... "most" meaning "all" in a majority of the cases...

=== nmmm is now known as nmmm-away
[20:17] <dpurgert> newtoubuntu, what can we help you with today?
[20:17] <dbrom_> abyss42: Just better find the .deb then convert a file.... When a .rpm file is made its done in a different matter then a .deb
[20:17] <ultreia> dbrom_; so this wouldn't help? "dd if=archive_whole of=arc_seg1 iseek=400 count=400"
[20:17] <abyss42> zykotick9, why would it be such a bad idea? I am trying to convert oracle database servers rpm package to deb because it only has rpm packages. Has anyone ever had this issue
[20:18] <dbrom_> ultreia: do i compress the file then do the dd string

[20:19] <Devaki> If i use Windows Installer for ubuntu, will i lose windows ? or will it be a optional ?
[20:19] <ultreia> dbrom_; you'd at least tar the file, like the others have said, you might not want to gzip it
[20:19] <dbrom_> im making a .tar with no compression now
[20:19] <dpurgert> Devaki, nope, you should be able to keep the win partition
[20:19] <MonkeyDust> Devaki  you will create a space inside windows, get frustrated and think ubuntu is no good

[20:20] <MonkeyDust> Devaki  don't use wubi
[20:20] <mc_teo> Hey, I was dual booting 12.04 with win7, and then I tried installing Solidworks on win7, which corrupted the grub (well, burg) installation on the MBR. I tried booting from my USB memory stick (from which I had originally installed 12.04), and it gave "OS not found". I needed some files on the ntfs partition, and after a day or two messing around with it, I just used the windows recovery cd to reinstall windows bootloader. Now that I've some time, I want
[20:20] <mc_teo> ed to reinstall burg, but when I try booting from the USB memory stick, it gives the same "OS not found". Any idea what could be the problem?
[20:20] <abyss42> Has anyone tried installing oracle database server on ubuntu?

[20:21] <andreas__> it is for ubuntu that I am asking support for :)
[20:21] <Devaki> MonkeyDust , probably. But keep in mind that i am a developer, not a facebook person :)
[20:21] <dpurgert> should be as simple as "connect to VPN ..." and then enter the parameters (least that's how it was for me)
[20:21] <Devaki> I an bare a couple of things.
[20:21] <altker128> BluesKaj: Are the repos available anywhere?
[20:21] <altker128> BluesKaj: I understand it's EOL and over.
[20:21] <MonkeyDust> Devaki  wubi is the windows installer and i don't have facebook myself :)
[20:21] <dpurgert> Devaki, wubi is the Windows-based Ubuntu installer ... thing

[20:22] <Devaki> I'm lazy right now :D
[20:22] <dpurgert> Devaki, no ... it's a windows-based installer... not "installs it as a windows program"

[20:23] <penguin_> does anyone here know what redshift is?
[20:23] <Tm_T> Devaki: please don't use that term

[20:24] <MonkeyDust> penguin_  yes, it's physics and OT here
=== 6JTAADQRW is now known as joris
[20:24] <penguin_> it's not physics
[20:24] <jpds> MonkeyDust: It's not.
[20:24] <MonkeyDust> penguin_  redshift is used to measure the speed and distance of stars
[20:24] <penguin_> i'm talking about the PROGRAM called redshift --- not the uh.. other stuff
[20:24] <MonkeyDust> ok
[20:24] <jpds> MonkeyDust: Sigh.
[20:24] <jpds> !info gtk-redshift | MonkeyDust
[20:24] <ubottu> MonkeyDust: gtk-redshift (source: redshift): Adjusts the color temperature of your screen with GTK+ integration. In component universe, is extra. Version 1.7-2ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 64 kB, installed size 504 kB
[20:24] <jrtappers> penguin_, the program changes monitor colour based on time
[20:25] <BluesKaj> altker128, http://askubuntu.com/questions/91815/how-to-install-software-or-upgrade-from-old-unsupported-release
[20:25] <penguin_> yeah ... so if you don't use redshift -- download it - sudo apt-get install redshift
[20:25] <hilo> What is the best filesystem on ubuntu to use for temporarily writing a credentials file to pass to another program? Also, in general, can anyone elaborate on the risks of doing so, or using a filesystem that is persistent vs. RAM backed (since this is the recommended way of mounting samba from /etc/fstab as far as I can tell)?
[20:25] <penguin_> redshift is AMAZING
[20:25] <jpds> penguin_: Dude.
[20:25] <penguin_> sorry
[20:25] <jpds> penguin_: People choose what they want to do.
[20:25] <Devaki> then wubi it is !
[20:26] <penguin_> yeah but what if they have not heard of redshift yet
[20:26] <ultreia> sounds weird having your monitor colors changing all the time
[20:26] <penguin_> it's actually quite nice
[20:26] <jpds> ultreia: It does it gradually.
[20:26] <penguin_> yeah

[20:26] <jrtappers> venik212, is there anything in addition drivers for it?
[20:27] <penguin_> sudo apt-get install redshift && redshift -t 6500:4700
[20:27] <jpds> penguin_: OK, enough.
[20:27] <penguin_> try it
[20:27] <ultreia> dbrom_; you decide how many segments you want, and from that decide the size of each segment
[20:27] <venik212> I believe that my wifi troubles all have to do with the ipw2200 driver
[20:27] <dbrom_> ok
[20:27] <venik212> it is VERY flaky
[20:28] <penguin_> sudo apt-get install redshift && redshift -t 6500:4700 -g 0.78
[20:28] <ultreia> dbrom_; then "dd if=infile.tar of=outfile.tar-0 iseek=0 size=n"

[20:29] <ultreia> dbrom_; then repeat that process for each of the segments, using a different iseek value and "of=" output file

[20:32] <ultreia> dbrom_; oh, umm, try bs=1M
[20:32] <roy_> what's DCC command for and how to use it here?
[20:32] <BluesKaj> altker128, then I've run out of ideas , all I can suggest is take the time to upgrade your OS , you can do it with internet upgrade if you have a fast connection , sudo do-release-upgrade
[20:32] <v1c3> penguin_: i'll give it a try :D
[20:32] <penguin_> haha
[20:32] <ultreia> dbrom_; then you'd need to do the iseek and count in megabytes

[20:46] <siluetas> hey, I've got a question: I'm looking to buy a laptop with the intention to run ubuntu on it and do some light gaming, whether through wine, steam or a win partition. However, I've run into trouble with hybrid graphics in the past and I really want to avoid it this time.
[20:46] <siluetas> The one way I can think of doing that is to get a laptop that only has a dedicated graphics card, not a set of two GPUs. Can someone give me advice in this regard?
[20:47] <dpurgert> siluetas, not really sure if any of those exist anymore ... :|
[20:48] <marianne> does anyone know if there is a place you can buy a laptop and have ubuntu installed and configured on it for free?
[20:48] <h00k> siluetas: check out https://friendly.ubuntu.com/ for compatibility
[20:48] <dpurgert> marianne, system76 does it ...
[20:48] <h00k> marianne: system76 makes pre-installed hardware
[20:49] <dpurgert> https://www.system76.com/
[20:49] <marianne> h00k: how's the quality?
[20:49] <h00k> marianne: I don't know as I haven't owned one, but good from what I hear
[20:50] <dpurgert> the hardware looks like it's IBM/Lenovo ... but I'm just going off pictures, so ...
[20:50] <dpurgert> well, at least the servers/laptops ...

[20:51] <BluesKaj> siluetas, make the laptop specs don't have "optimus graphics , or "hybrid graphics" using 2 gpus
[20:52] <theseus> just cant boot up correctly when charging cable isn't plugged in
[20:52] <theseus> everytime I turn on my laptop without the power cable plugged in, Ubuntu 12.04 won't boot to unity, any ideas?
[20:53] <dpurgert> actually, yeah ... the servers and laptops look dead on as rebranded Lenovo/IBM cases...
[20:53] <siluetas> h00k: I did check that list, but then I saw things like http://askubuntu.com/questions/196472/dell-15r-overheating which seem to be related to the hybrid graphics thing, leading me back to the question.
[20:53] <zykotick9> theseus: do you have some optimus/hybrid graphics setup?  sounds like battery power is disabling 3d... just guessing here.
[20:54] <marianne> h00k: they don't look too bad online. not too pricy Next question. Is Blu-ray supported in 12.4
[20:54] <h00k> dpurgert: they make their own hardware, they're not just rebrands of lenovo :)
[20:55] <OerHeks> marianne with some tweaks yes
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[20:55] <dpurgert> h00k, yeah -- the desktop cases are definitely custom ... server cases do a lot of the IBM stuff (blue plastic all over the place instead of screws) ...
[20:55] <marianne> OerHeks: are the tweeks hard?
[20:56] <dpurgert> if that's the case ... well, I know where I'm grabbing a new server from (barring being able to grab an IBM for a decent price)

[20:56] <marianne> OerHeks: awesome... thanks
[20:56] <theseus> zykotick9: the wierd thing is that if I boot with it plugged in it will boot up fine and unplug after it still it fine.  Just cant boot with a laptop unplugged.  I find that odd
[20:57] <siluetas> so, is there any good way to avoid the hybrid graphics issue from the get go?
[20:57] <touil76> Hello everyone.
[20:58] <dpurgert> siluetas, force it in bios?
[20:58] <zykotick9> theseus: ya, i remember your issue from earlier/yesterday?  good luck.
[20:58] <touil76> I recently updated my ubuntu 12.04LTS, and since then, I cannot get sound via my headphone jack.
[20:58] <touil76> Anyone ever had this problem ?
[20:58] <BluesKaj> siluetas, I suppose  paying a bit more for dedicated graphics one way , just avoid the "hyprid graphics" price point
[20:59] <zykotick9> touil76: check "alsamixer" and verify your headphone isn't muted/turned down
[20:59] <Crazy_Spai> You know what issue I'm having? On my MSI my backlight flickers if it have it on anything but 0
[20:59] <touil76> zykotick9: I've already done that. It doesn't appear to be muted.
[20:59] <jhutchins> theseus: Does it not respond to the power switch, or does it try to boot and fail?
[21:00] <siluetas> BluesKaj what do you mean? I'm not well-versed in this stuff. Are there laptops that only have a dedicated gpu, but they cost more?
[21:02] <jhutchins> siluetas: THe problem is that laptop hardware changes so fast that by the time somebody's bought one, put ubuntu on it, and gotten the graphics working or given up, the models in the store have different hardware.
[21:03] <betah> hey guys, I am with a trouble. I installed Ubuntu 12.10 after Windows, but I can't replace Windows Boot Manager for GRUB. I tried to use a live cd and restore grub (using chroot), but it has not worked. Can anyone help me?
[21:03] <touil76> What should I do ?
[21:04] <BluesKaj> siluetas, or just buy one with onboard graphics if you're not using it for gaming etc
[21:04] <jhutchins> betah: Which version of windows?  What happened when you tried to install grub?
[21:05] <siluetas> yea, I wanted to do some gaming.
[21:05] <mrmcgibby> When I login, I just get kicked back to the login screen.  Any troubleshooting tips?
[21:06] <mrmcgibby> what logs should I be looking at?
[21:06] <betah> jhutchins: I use Windows 7. Nothing happened. Windows boot manager was not replaced
[21:06] <chomps> betah: you can do this one of two ways. with a live ubuntu cd or if the OS loads with the disk manager. I would use the live cd mount the partition eg: sudo mount /dev/sda1 /mnt (if sda1 is the root) and then sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt/ /dev/sda
[21:07] <betah> chomps, I did that
[21:07] <jhutchins> betah: No error messages or anything? Where did you tell it to install?
[21:07] <betah> didnt work
[21:07] <betah> no error messages

[21:07] <betah> but when I reboot the computer, WBM still there
[21:08] <jhutchins> betah: Did you install to /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda?
[21:08] <chomps> betah: after a reboot you should also "sudo update-grub"

[21:08] <wyvrn__> Hello, I am trying to change/set password min length, age, complexity, etc... But /etc/default/useradd/etc/login.defs isn't there.. /useradd is not there either, just a file
[21:09] <zykotick9> chomps: fyi, just using a livcd, mounting root and trying grub-install will fail... you need to chroot correctly for that to work.
[21:09] <betah> I installed grub at /dev/sda, as it should be
[21:09] <chomps> betah: I would then try a reinstall of ubuntu from live cd
[21:09] <betah> I will try a grub-update now, I think I did that, but I will try again
[21:10] <betah> chomps, I tried this
[21:10] <wyvrn__> Anyone know how to set min password age and min password length?

[21:10] <jhutchins> betah: I had some trouble with W7, ended up just reformatting the drive.  You could back up the windows part with partimage and restore it after you get Ubuntu working.
[21:10] <betah> one minute, I will try again restore grub and update late
[21:10] <chomps> betah: you can also do "sudo update-grub2" depending on the grub installed. in your case it should be grub2
[21:10] <wyvrn__> *max password age
[21:11] <betah> ok, chomps.. thx
[21:11] <betah> jhutchins, this will be my last choice... I will try a way to restore grub first

[21:17] <wibby> Hi, i'm trying to install ubuntu from a usb stick. when i boot from the stick, i get "kernel panic: not syncing: vfs: unable to mount root fs on unknown block(0,0)". what to do?
[21:17] <wyvrn__> thanks jhutchins
[21:17] <chomps> wyvrn__: you should see something like this: password   required   pam_unix.so nullok obscure min=4 max=8 md5
[21:17] <Devaki> I just installed ubuntu.
[21:18] <chomps> wyvrn__: change min/max to suit
[21:18] <MonkeyDust> ezrafree  from wikipedia: "Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) is a framework for authentication and data security in Internet protocols. It decouples authentication mechanisms from application protocols"
[21:18] <wyvrn__> ok
[21:18] <ezrafree> MonkeyDust: yes, i read that as well. just looking for a more laymen's terms way of saying it i guess.. like those types of logins that require encryption, is that what it provides?
[21:18] <betah> hey, now I have a clue
[21:19] <betah> when I tried to "update-grub" I got this out
[21:19] <jhutchins> wyvrn__: /etc/login.defs for password age.
[21:20] <betah> /usr/sbin/grub-probe: erro: failed to get canonical path of /cow
[21:20] <MonkeyDust> ezrafree  i guess it's not a layman's thing and nothing you have to worry about
[21:20] <betah> so I cannot update grub
[21:20] <betah> jhutchins?
[21:20] <ezrafree> MonkeyDust: i never said it was "a laymen's thing" i simply asked if someone could explain this complicated software to me in laymen's terms.
[21:20] <betah> \msg jhutchins are you there?
[21:22] <chomps> wyvrn__: do you mean the lockout policy as in 'change passwd after xx days' and such?
[21:22] <jhutchins> Sometimes.
[21:23] <chomps> wyvrn__: try here: /etc/login.defs
[21:23] <wyvrn__> chomps: I mean lockout like if you have 5 failed login attempts it locks you out for a bit
[21:23] <wyvrn__> on
[21:23] <wyvrn__> *ok
[21:24] <chomps> wyvrn__: look for "PASS_MAX_DAYS"
[21:24] <jhutchins> wyvrn__: You need pam.taly for that.
[21:24] <wyvrn__> oh ok
[21:25] <jhutchins> wyvrn__: auth        required      pam_tally.so per_user deny=3
[21:25] <wyvrn__> Thanks!
[21:25] <chomps> wyvrn__: also "LOGIN_RETRIES" and "LOGIN_TIMEOUT"

[22:16] <jrib> Vivekananda: I still don't know why you are sending me this.  Didn't we discuss your options already?  Either use emacs-snapshot from the ppa you added or just upgrade to 12.04 since you'll need to upgrade soon anyway
[22:21] <Vivekananda> jrib: I was hoping to install emacs 24 with dependencies for the time being and work on upgrading later. I am not sure in what ways the upgrade might change my system and also new upgrade requires more processing power(read somewhere) and my comp an old celeron 1.6 ghz max :)
[22:22] <jrib> Vivekananda: you know the link you gave says you don't even need emacs24?

[23:17] <SonikkuAmerica> BillyZane2: Are you in System Settings?
[23:17] <BillyZane2> sonikkuamerica: yes
[23:17] <SonikkuAmerica> Go down to "Displays"
[23:17] <BillyZane2> yes, i am there. the max resolution i can select is 640x480
[23:17] <SonikkuAmerica> and check the "Resolution" combo box
[23:17] <BillyZane2> i do not have this problem in windows
[23:18] <BillyZane2> on sec
[23:18] <SonikkuAmerica> OK... what's your video card?
[23:18] <BillyZane2> GTX660
[23:18] <BillyZane2> there is no resolution combo box
[23:18] <BillyZane2> let me give some background information
[23:18] <SonikkuAmerica> OK
[23:19] <BillyZane2> i recently installed ubuntu. I had set it up. I got my resolution to look good. I was running from my PC's DVI out, to a DVI-VGA converter, to a VGA cable, to a VGA port on my monitor
[23:19] <BillyZane2> I recently tried switching to All DVI, that's when everything went bad
[23:20] <BillyZane2> I recently tested this monitor and the DVI cable on another computer, everything was fine
[23:20] <histo> BillyZane2: do YOu have an nvidia card?
[23:20] <BillyZane2> when I connected it to this one, i got a blue screen of death on windows
[23:20] <BillyZane2> yes
[23:20] <BillyZane2> an nvidia GTX660
[23:20] <histo> BillyZane2: sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[23:20] <SonikkuAmerica> So VGA works but not DVI.
[23:20] <histo> BillyZane2: unless you've already installed nvidia drivers
[23:21] <histo> BillyZane2: holdup I thought the issue was resolution right?
[23:21] <BillyZane2> when I use DVI on windows, i can only get 1024x768 resolution, when I use VGA on windows, i can get full resolution. here's the weird thing, I can't get full resolution on ubuntu regardless of VGA or DVI
[23:21] <BillyZane2> histo: the nvidia drivers are installed
[23:22] <BillyZane2> and it all started because i decided to switch from VGA to DVI, a seemingly innocent thing
[23:22] <BillyZane2> but now, nothing works right
[23:22] <BillyZane2> xfce is starting to act funny too for some odd reason. I just installed it last night. Now, the terminal emulator doesn't work. thank god i decided to install xterm inc ase any problems happen with terminal
[23:23] <SonikkuAmerica> So this is Xubuntu?
[23:24] <BillyZane2> the process of installing my video card drivers was not as simple as simply doing install nvidia-current, that caused major problems. I had to use a very detailed install that I was guided through in this channel that got it to work, and i don't think it's worth messing with
[23:24] <BillyZane2> no, it's XFCE4
[23:24] <Foxhoundz> Ubuntu doesn't save backlight brightness settings.
[23:24] <Foxhoundz> what gives?
[23:25] <BillyZane2> I can do a couple of commands so who up some information for you guys
[23:25] <Foxhoundz> Adjusting the backlight using the OEM keys is abrupt instead of a smooth transition I've gotten used to on Windows.
[23:25] <Foxhoundz> Is there a fix for this?
[23:25] <SonikkuAmerica> BillyZane2, is your card an NVIDIA card.
[23:25] <Foxhoundz> or do I have to use an shell script to progrmatically set the backlight at logon
[23:25] <SonikkuAmerica> ?
[23:25] <Foxhoundz> it's becoming a pain.
[23:26] <SonikkuAmerica> Foxhoundz: Not that I know of.
[23:26] <SonikkuAmerica> Sorry.
[23:26] <Foxhoundz> sigh
[23:26] <BillyZane2> SonikkuAmerica, : YES, lol. it's an nVIdia GTX 660
[23:27] <SonikkuAmerica> Do you have NVIDIA X Server Settings installed?
[23:27] <BillyZane2> I recently got my video card fully installed with proper drivers on ubuntu
[23:27] <BillyZane2> yes i do
[23:27] <BillyZane2> SonikkuAmerica, : yes
[23:27] <BillyZane2> i tried using that as well
[23:27] <SonikkuAmerica> Did you run [ sudo nvidia-xconfig ] in a terminal after you connected using all DVI?
[23:28] <BillyZane2> SonikkuAmerica, : no i did not, i only did it when i had VGA
[23:28] <BillyZane2> i'll try it now
[23:28] <test12378> Ok i am back from class. I wish to continue troubleshooting this problem. The problem is that text appears very weird as seen at http://imagebin.org/244082

[23:30] <cambrianExplosio> hey, im having real trouble with ubuntu on a macbook, could anyone help me out?
[23:30] <test12378> it does not happen at startup, usually sometime after, though i have not been able to pinpoint exactly what causes it
[23:30] <test12378> usually a ctrl+alt+ backspace fixes it, but that loses everything so its annoying
[23:30] <PatrickC> ok, i am new to ubuntu server
[23:31] <PatrickC> i created a new user, but when i su username i only drop to $
[23:31] <PatrickC> i still have full terminal access, but its really odly set up
[23:31] <PatrickC> never seen it like this
[23:31] <test12378> i would say it happens from 15 minutes to an hour after startup
[23:32] <SonikkuAmerica> test12378, Ctrl+Alt+Backspace doesn't do squat. Did you mean Ctrl+Alt+Delete?
[23:32] <test12378> patrickC, ubuntu server has no gui, if that is what you are asking

[23:32] <SonikkuAmerica> test12378: Oh, right

[23:37] <SonikkuAmerica> BillyZane2, Can you find nvidia-settings?
[23:37] <BillyZane2> SonikkuAmerica: let me check
[23:37] <BillyZane2> yes i can
[23:37] <SonikkuAmerica> BillyZane2, (run [ sudo nvidia-settings ] in a terminal if you can't find it in the menus)
[23:38] <BillyZane2> i did
[23:38] <SonikkuAmerica> Open it up
[23:38] <BillyZane2> it's up
[23:38] <BillyZane2> ok
[23:38] <SonikkuAmerica> You should be able to set the res from there.
[23:38] <BillyZane2> only gives me 640x480 as the max resolution
[23:39] <schultza> histo: i mean kernel switch kernel level cmdline switches for boot up options.. i set those in said file and when ubuntu installes a new kernel, my option is removed
[23:39] <BillyZane2> to clarify, these drivers and everything else worked perfectly fine just a few days ago. it was when i switched to a DVI cable that this happened
[23:40] <schultza> histo: and that's were i previously had it.. . but ubuntu removed that on me
[23:41] <test12378> so anyone have any ideas about that glitchy text?

[23:52] <SonikkuAmerica> Hi alexddfvdfsdfdsf
[23:52] <BillyZane2> i don't have gnome :(
[23:52] <test12378> Uhh, how do you propose i test it? Video is integrated, is their some kind of memtest for that?
[23:52] <BillyZane2> histo: i have xfce, kde and unity
=== truexfan404 is now known as truexfan81
[23:52] <BillyZane2> histo: is there a command i could use?
[23:52] <BillyZane2> histo: i suppose i could just install gnome
[23:52] <SonikkuAmerica> test12378, is memtest86+ in your Grub menu?
[23:53] <histo> BillyZane2: alt+f2 to open a run dialog and type in gnome-control-center
[23:53] <roasted> Question - I'm using this find command: find /media/storage/surveillance/* -mtime +3 -exec rm -r {} \;    Am I correct in understanding that the find command will NOT search recursively deeper than "surveillance"?
[23:53] <SonikkuAmerica> test12378: You can check by running [ sudo update-grub ] in a terminal
[23:54] <BillyZane2> histo: I just loaded it. the problem is, the panel is far bigger than my resolution. i can't shrink down this window
[23:54] <alexddfvdfsdfdsf> press alt to drag the window
[23:54] <alexddfvdfsdfdsf> alt-click
[23:55] <histo> BillyZane2: or actually run jockey-gtk
[23:55] <tdignan> Is there a way to create a custom launcher in unity?
[23:56] <BillyZane2> histo: I got in!
[23:56] <BillyZane2> i see 4 options under additional drivers
[23:56] <BillyZane2> there are "experimental nvidia drivers"
[23:57] <BillyZane2> err.. not driver, binary

[23:58] <histo> BillyZane2: press the printscreen key
[23:58] <histo> BillyZane2: or alt+f2 to open a run dialog and use scrot
