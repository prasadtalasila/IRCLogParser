[02:19] <akk> Anyone know how to fix "Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages" on an apt-get install?
[02:19] <akk> I'm trying to install a KDE package, and it says I've held a bunch of KDE packages that I've never installed at all.
[02:20] <bkerensa> akk:  sudo apt-get install -f
[02:20] <bkerensa> ?
[02:22] <akk> Adding a -f gives the same error message.
[02:25] <akk> and apt-get -f install without the package name gives nothing.
[02:26] <akk> Could it be a pinning issue? I added pinning yesterday because I needed 3 packages from neuro-debian, but I *think* I set things up so that only those packages can come from there.
[02:26] <akk> And aptitude show calligra is showing an ubuntu version, not a neuro-debian one.
[02:29] <geofft> akk: Can you pastebin the output? Or is it just that one error?
[02:29] <akk> No, it's a long list. I'll pastebin.
[02:31] <akk> The error message: http://pastebin.com/48y5GTEy
[02:31] <darthrobot> Title: [# apt-get install -f calligra Reading package lists... Done Building dependenc - Pastebin.com]
[02:32] <akk> And in case I messed something up with improper pinning, here's my /etc/apt/preferences: http://pastebin.com/EXPXWNT5
[02:32] <darthrobot> Title: [Package: * Pin: release a=precise-security Pin-Priority: 950 Package: * Pi - Pastebin.com]
[02:32] <geofft> ah. apt-get's error messages suck. I would perhaps try installing each dependency and see what error you get.
[02:33] <akk> Looking at the dependency list, I'm suspecting that I probably don't want this package anyway.
[02:33] <akk> Tried to install it on a different machine and it predicted something like a 150Mb download.
[02:34] <akk> But I'd still like to know what the error means and whether I messed up my pins.
[02:35]  * akk doesn't understand pinning, misses the old simple APT::Default-Release option
[02:51] <geofft> your pins don't look wrong to me
[02:53] <akk> Thanks, that's good to know.
[02:53] <akk> I can live without Calligra -- maybe it's just a broken package.
[02:54] <akk> I'm investigating (not super heavyweight) ways of editing text and graphics in the same document.
[02:54] <akk> Thought maybe calligra could, but the requirements make me doubt the "not super heavyweight" part anyway.
[17:29] <nhaines> pleia2: I'm not sure if that support request on the ML was sweet or creepy.  :)
[17:31] <pleia2> nhaines: you should see the emails he's sent to me directly :\
[17:32] <pleia2> I believe he is trying to be nice though
[17:33] <pleia2> what girl doesn't like being told that some guy on the internet "likes their pictures"?

[18:37] <nhaines> pleia2: oh, direct emails doesn't sound so great.  :(  But hooray for benefit of the doubt!
[18:38] <nhaines> My policy was always that Ubuntu Hour tech support was free and outside of that people pay my full stranger tech support rate.  :P
[18:41] <pleia2> he emailed the list because I told him to ;)
[18:42] <pleia2> "I don't have time for one-on-one support requests right now, please email...
[18:42] <pleia2> (I am shipping him a 12.10 disk though)
