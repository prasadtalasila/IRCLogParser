[01:30] <bkerensa> Gareth: so looks like you get three people instead of little ol' me :) Mozilla is flying one person from Canada and two from the Midwest and they may also fly some folks from MV plus we have one local person there
[01:30] <bkerensa> :)
[01:30] <bkerensa> and they are bringing Firefox OS Phones :)
[01:30] <bkerensa> and swag galore
[01:31] <Gareth> bkerensa: awesome!
[01:32] <Gareth> bkerensa: ..and they'll leave one of the Firefox OS Phones for me.
[06:45] <bkerensa> Gareth: I wish :P I have not even got my FF phone yet... was supposed to get it this month but looking more like next month
