[08:15] <ochosi> morning
[08:18] <Noskcaj> ochosi, evening
[08:18] <ochosi> :)
[10:04] <bluesabre> morning ochosi
[10:04] <ochosi> and an early morning to you bluesabre :)
[10:05] <bluesabre> indeed!
[10:05] <bluesabre> working on catfish a bit
[10:05] <ochosi> ah, how's that going so far?
[10:05] <bluesabre> good
[10:06] <bluesabre> its no longer using find
[10:06] <ochosi> at all?
[10:06] <bluesabre> hard to interrupt that particular command
[10:06] <bluesabre> and from what I've read that others have done, os.walk is actually faster
[10:06] <bluesabre> so now the stop button actually work and the program is responsive
[10:07] <ochosi> is os.walk python-specific?
[10:07] <bluesabre> even when doing a fulltext search
[10:07] <bluesabre> yeah
[10:07] <ochosi> sweet
[10:08] <bluesabre> I'll try to do an experimental release sometime this weekend for everyone to play with
[10:08] <ochosi> sounds cool
[10:08] <bluesabre> I've been rewriting to whole thing from the ground up
[10:08] <ochosi> whoa, really?
[10:08] <bluesabre> it should work with either python 2 or 3 too
[10:09] <bluesabre> and fewer dependencies
[10:09] <bluesabre> :)
[10:10] <ochosi> awesome
[10:14] <ochosi> btw, thoughts on making the eject buttons in thunar look more like actual buttons?
[10:14] <ochosi> e.g. something like this: http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-01042013-111448am.php
[10:15] <ochosi> currently the button-border is too harsh etc, but just to illustrate the idea
[10:16] <bluesabre> maybe
[10:16] <ochosi> to give it more of a "click me" feeling
[10:16] <bluesabre> how would it look when that device is selected?
[10:16] <ochosi> currently like this: http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-01042013-111627am.php
[10:17] <bluesabre> I would agree to that
[10:17] <bluesabre> :)
[10:18] <ochosi> guess it needs more tweaking, but i think it could work
[10:19] <ochosi> somehow the eject-icon feels like it has too little padding inside the "button"

[16:16] <ochosi> knome: what do you think about the eject "button" (screenshots see above)
[18:39] <knome> ochosi, hmmh. the borders could be less contrasty at least
[18:45] <ochosi> knome: yeah, it's just an illustration, not a final proposal or anything
[18:45] <knome> i think the current no-button-style works well too
[18:52] <ochosi> i mean the main problem of the proposal is that there won't be a hover-style
[18:52] <ochosi> since that's impossible
[18:52] <ochosi> (in treeviews)
[18:52] <ochosi> but the current ones just don't look all-too clickable
[18:52] <ochosi> but maybe you're right and users don't notice that anyway :)
