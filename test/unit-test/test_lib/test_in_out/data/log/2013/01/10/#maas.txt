[16:45] <roaksoax> rvba: howdy! what;s the status of MAAS
[16:45] <roaksoax> rvba: are there anything left we need for thje precise SRU?
[16:45] <roaksoax> s/are/is
[16:46] <rvba> roaksoax: as far as we're concerned, everything is in there.  Do you wanted to do something about bug 1086162?
[16:46] <ubot5> bug 1086162 in maas (Ubuntu) "IPMI based power management default to IPMI 1.5 based authentication" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086162
[16:47] <rvba> roaksoax: also, I suppose we can't SRU it before python-django is SRU'ed.
[16:47] <roaksoax> rvba: yeah so we are going to the Technical Board for an exception for everything
[16:47] <rvba> ah ok
[16:47] <roaksoax> rvba: since a SRU team member also reviewed another SRU needed and got rejected
[16:47] <roaksoax> rvba: and I think we should do something about that bug
[16:48] <roaksoax> rvba: but that can potentially create an issue when detecting IPMI right?
[16:48] <roaksoax> rvba: we need to detect the version itself
[16:49] <rvba> roaksoax: I don't know if that's doable to be honest, but letting the user configure it (see the diff I added in my last comment) was one solution.
[16:50] <roaksoax> rvba: i'd say go for it
[17:02] <rvba> roaksoax: this was just a suggestion because I have no way to test this on real hardware (the lab uses 1.5 IPMI).
[17:03] <rvba> roaksoax: looking at the milestone's list of bugs, I see there is another bug: bug 1064527.
[17:03] <ubot5> bug 1064527 in maas (Ubuntu Raring) "detect_ipmi needs improvement. detects non-existant device in nested kvm" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1064527
[17:09] <roaksoax> rvba: yeah that ltest bug is an impossible almost
[17:09] <roaksoax> there's no way to different
[23:43] <roaksoax> bigjools: howdy
[23:43] <bigjools> o/ roaksoax
[23:43] <roaksoax> bigjools: how's everything?
[23:43] <bigjools> apart from melting, great!
[23:44] <roaksoax> bigjools: heh... is that that warm in australia?
[23:44] <roaksoax> bigjools: so I read you guys are finally done with MAAS
[23:44] <roaksoax> bigjools: i'm gonna be filing this to the TB this upcoming monday
[23:44] <roaksoax> bigjools: but will be doing some packaging testing
[23:44] <roaksoax> bigjools: so I guess I'm free to do uploads without worrying anything will break
[23:44] <roaksoax> bigjools: i will first upload 12.10 stabilization branch to raring
[23:44] <roaksoax> and then whatever is in trunk, is that ok?
[23:45] <bigjools> roaksoax: indeed we are moving on to another project - however rvb said he might look into the ipmi thing if you don't do it first
[23:45] <bigjools> it depends on how urgent it is?
[23:45] <bigjools> 12.10 branch to raring?  No, that;s only for quantal
[23:46] <bigjools> upload trunk to raring
[23:46] <bigjools> it has all the fixes
[23:46] <roaksoax> bigjools: we can't SRU without having it in raring
[23:46] <bigjools> wtf
[23:46] <roaksoax> bigjools: so it *has* to go to raring first
[23:46] <bigjools> it's a different branch
[23:46] <roaksoax> bigjools: yeah it is fine
[23:46]  * bigjools boggles at the bureaucracy
[23:46] <roaksoax> unless there's code changes that unable it to run in raring
[23:46] <roaksoax> then it should be fine
[23:46] <bigjools> it will run
[23:47] <roaksoax> ok so we are good
[23:47] <roaksoax> once SRU'd i'll upload trunk
[23:47]  * bigjools retracts that
[23:47] <bigjools> it might run
[23:47] <bigjools> not tested
[23:47] <roaksoax> heh
[23:47] <roaksoax> alright, i don't think (hoping) there will be any issues
[23:47] <bigjools> but we know the chain.c32 thing is broken
[23:47] <roaksoax> bigjools: yeah that's foundations
[23:47] <roaksoax> :)
[23:47] <bigjools> heh
[23:49] <roaksoax> raring wasn't even booting after installation
[23:49] <roaksoax> last week
[23:49] <roaksoax> so i'm hoping is kinda related
[23:49] <roaksoax> i haven't yet tested
[23:49] <roaksoax> i'll work on it tomorrow/monday
[23:49] <bigjools> ok
[23:49] <roaksoax> i wanna get this done too since i'm swamped with the HA stuff for OpenStack
[23:49] <bigjools> so
[23:50] <bigjools> does it not count that the trunk has got all the same revisions in it as the 12.10 stuff?
[23:50] <roaksoax> bigjools: i'm thinking we are going to have to bump major version
[23:50] <bigjools> I mean literally the same, they were backported by merging
[23:50] <bigjools> trunk is only separate because it has new features
[23:50] <roaksoax> bigjools: yeah we are going to have to bump the version of MAAS
[23:51] <bigjools> why?
[23:51] <roaksoax> bigjools: probably maas 0.2+bzr
[23:51] <roaksoax> we should actally have bumped maas
[23:51] <roaksoax> when we had the region/cluster controller
[23:52] <bigjools> I bumped the revno in one of the PPAs :)
[23:52] <roaksoax> ack
[23:52] <bigjools> but only  because someone uploaded the wrong version :/
[23:52] <roaksoax> he
[23:52] <roaksoax> heh
[23:52] <roaksoax> yeah we need to fingure something out for that
[23:52] <roaksoax> to differentiate the versions
[23:52] <roaksoax> i do think we should bump the version
[23:52] <roaksoax> to 0.2
[23:52] <roaksoax> for raring
[23:53] <bigjools> well
[23:53] <bigjools> the same code will be in 12.04 and 12.10
[23:53] <bigjools> so you'd bump it there too?
[23:54] <roaksoax> bigjools: no, so stabilization branch will continue to be 0.1
[23:54] <roaksoax> trunk will be 0.2
[23:54] <roaksoax> trunk has new features right? it just make sense to bump the version
[23:54] <roaksoax> or even 0.1.1 if you want
[23:54] <bigjools> roaksoax: yes but not the cluster change, just 2 small features
[23:54] <bigjools> cluster stuff is in 12.10
[23:55] <bigjools> (awaiting 12.10 I mean)
[23:55] <roaksoax> right
[23:55] <bigjools> no, is in 12.10 :)
[23:55] <bigjools> awaiting 12.04!
[23:55] <roaksoax> right
[23:55] <roaksoax> so stabilization vs trunk should differ on their versioning IMHO
[23:56] <bigjools> we should have bumped for 12.10 :/
[23:59] <roaksoax> indeed
