[09:12] <jussi> JontheEchidna: just filed a nice crash bug for you :)
[11:17] <Riddell> whee snow!
[11:32] <Riddell> http://www.kubuntu.org/news/amarok-2.7
[11:43] <soee> Riddell, what about dke 4.10 rc3 for quantal ?
[11:54] <Riddell> soee: looks all ready to test in ppa:kubuntu-ppa/staging
[12:31] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[12:34] <Riddell> hi, 4.10 rc 3 testing needed
[12:46] <sbivol> Riddell: I'd like to test it. where do I begin?
[12:47] <Riddell> sbivol: on raring or quantal?
[12:47] <BluesKaj> Riddell, 4.9.98?
[12:47] <sbivol> quantal, but I'm prepared to install raring if it's of more use
[12:48] <Riddell> BluesKaj: yes
[12:48] <Riddell> sbivol: add ppa:kubuntu-ppa/staging
[12:48] <Riddell> and dist-upgrade
[12:48] <Riddell> and see what breaks :)
[12:49] <BluesKaj> gotta reboot , just updated/upgraded on 13.04
[12:50] <soee> will test it on quantal
[12:52] <Riddell> BluesKaj: with raring-proposed enabled?
[12:58] <BluesKaj> ok , I've been on 4.40 all along and the last upgrade restored the Toolbar and Menubar on all apps so far ...they were missing and unretrievable 
[12:58] <soee> is it me or launchpad bandwich is limited to ~ 60 kB/s ?
[12:59] <BluesKaj> err 410
[13:00] <Riddell> soee: it's pretty slow for me
[13:00] <soee> Riddell, ok thank you
[13:13] <sbivol> Riddell: I've upgraded via Muon and rebooted. everything's good. 
[13:17] <Riddell> sbivol: yay thanks
[14:08] <soee> Riddell, quantal upgrade RC2->RC3 without any  problems on my laptop
[14:09] <Riddell> groovy

[15:42]  * yofel still gets kde bug 310486 in a quantal VM
[15:42] <ubottu> KDE bug 310486 in general "Unable to logout/reboot after KDE upgrade." [Major,Unconfirmed] http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310486
[15:44] <soee> oh i thought that my be related to nvidia drivers issue or something with this reboot
[15:45] <soee> but i can confirm this - i get only darks screen when wanted to reboot 
[15:45] <yofel> well, this only happens on 4.9->4.10 upgrades, not 4.9.97->4.9.98
[15:45] <soee> and nothing happen 
[15:45] <yofel> or does it?
[15:46] <soee> yofel, i had it, and after waiting like 1 minut with dark screen i just restarted my laptop
[15:46] <yofel> yeah, that's what you'll see with that bug
[15:47] <sbivol> today I upgraded 4.9.97->4.9.98 and had no issues rebooting via Alt+Ctrl+Shift+PgUp. didn't try from the dialog...

[17:16] <markey> my Chromium is acting a bit weird, after the upgrade from 22 to 23
[17:16] <markey> gobbles heaps of memory
[17:17] <markey> and slows down the whole system after a while :)
=== ximion-afk is now known as ximion
[17:41] <BluesKaj> yup , I dropped it , due it's failure to intergrate with kde settings , especially fonts
[17:43] <BluesKaj> markey, the tabs are unreadable on a large monitor with hi res
[17:44] <markey> BluesKaj: I didn't notice any change in UI rendering
[17:45] <markey> but then again, my display isn't very high res
[17:45] <markey> regarding the memory consumption and freezing, Mamarok is having the same issues with v23
[17:48] <markey> basically, it appears to be leaking memory
[18:02] <BluesKaj> markey, yes , I have heard reports about hight cpu usage on chromium , suspect it's the flash plugin 
[18:03] <markey> not so sure about that. Flash is the usual suspect, but I don't have it active in a tab very often. except for youtube
[18:05] <markey> also, the Flash plugin wasn't upgraded I think
[18:06] <BluesKaj> markey, well, a lot of sites have flash embedded , and Firefox seems to handle them using fewer resources than chromium
[18:08] <BluesKaj> I liked chromium , but it just isn't right for my setup
[18:08] <yofel> anyone an idea how to debug a stuck kdeinit? After upgrading my desktop to 4.9.98 startkde gets to start start_kdeinit_wrapper, which runs kdeinit and then it just stops

[19:09] <afiestas> raring says Kernel is 3.8.0 but 3.8 has not been released yet
[19:10] <afiestas> is there anyway of checking which -rc the kernel actually is?
=== jalcine_ is now known as Jacky
[19:18] <yofel> afiestas: kernel image package changelog. 3.8.0-1 is based on rc4
[19:18] <afiestas> yofel: how do you know?
[19:19] <afiestas> I mean, how can I check that myself?
[19:19] <yofel> sec
[19:19] <yofel> afiestas: see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.8.0-1.5
[19:20] <yofel> they always put the mainline kernel version in the changelog 
[19:21] <yofel> afiestas: if you have it installed you can just read /usr/share/doc/linux-image-3.8.0-1-generic/changelog.Debian.gz (replace version as needed)
[19:22] <yofel> Riddell: can it be that after uploading things to raring you didn't push the release commit in the branches to launchpad?
[19:22] <yofel> kmahjongg still says UNRELEASED
[19:23] <soee> afiestas, are you on 13.04 ?
[19:29] <afiestas> soee: yes
[19:29] <afiestas> yofel: thanks !
[19:30] <soee> afiestas, works fine? usable ?
[19:38] <afiestas> soee: for what I do, yes
[19:53] <shadeslayer> afiestas: or, you know, apt-get changelog linux
[19:53] <shadeslayer> replace linux as needed
[19:55] <sbivol> shadeslayer: one does not simply replace Linux
[19:55] <shadeslayer> hehe
[19:55] <Jacky> +1 ^

[23:39] <shadeslayer> silly launchpad
[23:40] <yofel> huh, I reuploaded that

[23:40] <shadeslayer> ah it's *still* stuck 
[23:40] <shadeslayer> Currently 1 package building and 0 packages waiting to build.
[23:40]  * shadeslayer runs script
[23:41] <yofel> opening the build gives an oops, so ignore it
[23:41] <shadeslayer> right
[23:42] <shadeslayer> I've seen loads of those today
[23:42] <shadeslayer> thought it was a temporary issye
[23:42] <shadeslayer> *issue
[23:42] <yofel> well, worse is that builds are randomly failing without reason

[23:52] <shadeslayer> "[HTTP 400]: same version has unpublished binaries in the destination archive for Quantal, please wait for them to be published before copying"
[23:52] <shadeslayer> I thought it'd error out or sth

[23:53] <shadeslayer> heh
[23:54] <shadeslayer> cool, all done
