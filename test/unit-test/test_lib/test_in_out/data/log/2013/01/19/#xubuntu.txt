[00:00] <wapiflapi> yeah well two monitors I just managed to get it working using xrandr
[00:00] <wapiflapi> no problem (althought it is weird a desktop like xubuntu doesnt have better configuraiton for this)
[00:01] <Unit193> Xfce, no idea if it does or not, I have a single display.
[00:02] <wapiflapi> Looking at xfce's mailing lists right now, it seems it isnt possible.

[11:26] <ali_banana> Hi, I have got an issue with Thunar. After a copy/past or a suppression, Thunar doesn't refresh automatically.
[12:35] <achilleas> hallo i am completely new to xubuntu, wondering if someone can help me with a very elementary question
[12:39] <Myrtti> difficult to know without the question
[12:39] <achilleas> :P
[12:40] <achilleas> i downloaded .deb package, i then went to the folder and opened a terminal there, i used the sudo dpkg -i command to install it, and it's working
[12:40] <achilleas> but i can't find the directory where the the package installed
[12:41] <Myrtti> why do you need to find it?
[12:42] <achilleas> it's a torrent client
[12:42] <achilleas> i want to assign it as my primary torrent application
[12:43] <Myrtti> well yes? if it's installed right, if you do "which appname" it might show it
[12:43] <achilleas> okay i will try that
[12:43] <achilleas> thanks for trying to help
[12:43] <achilleas> it's not that big of a deal, mostly i'm exploring the os, trying to figure a few basic things
[12:46] <achilleas> it worked
[12:46] <achilleas> thanks again ;)

[13:44] <lumpX> i am a few versions behind you and I am on a powerpc, so I might not be much help
[13:51] <freedomrun> thnx lumpX I have that in my RSS reader but searching it maybe worth it, thnx again
