[00:30] <mhall119> bkerensa: in the same way that a prius and a corvette are all just cars when it comes down to it
[00:32] <mhall119> but not amount of body work is going to make the prius a sportscar
[02:03] <cjohnston> mhall119: I haven't looked at the MP, but the concept is what I'm already using
[02:03] <mhall119> ok
[02:04] <mhall119> cjohnston: it just sounded odd to have an HTTP cookie that would be persistent
[02:04] <mhall119> kind of like a browser login session that never expires
[03:40] <popey> bkerensa: nope
[14:20] <cjohnston> mornin
[14:20] <smartboyhw> Hello
[15:10] <AlanBell> http://www.themonkeytail.com/2012/11/day-28.html who is up for that for the ringtail launch?
[15:11] <smartboyhw> AlanBell, !? (can't understand the meeting behind)
[17:42] <snap-l> BTW: Open Metalcast is on http://metalinjection.fm
[17:43] <snap-l> in case anyone is interested.
[19:53] <mhall119> G+ Communities need a "Ban this person and remove everything they've posted here" option
[20:05] <popey> +1
[20:05] <popey> Evening!
[20:16] <JanC> I don't think "remove" is the right thing to do, maybe "hide" them
[20:17] <JanC> (but then again, I don't even use G+...)
[20:17] <JanC> doesn't G+ have a killfilter or something like that?
[20:30] <czajkowski> popey: you made it back
[20:30] <czajkowski> yay
