[10:53] <kvarley>  brobostigon: I'm good. Snowing her, wish it'd stop
[10:53] <brobostigon> kvarley: we got alittle overnight, but that has been it.
[10:54] <brobostigon> i think at the moment, it is semi-raining, with a few flakes.
[10:55] <brobostigon> a day to test, if my new winter jacket. will keep me dry and warm.
[11:02] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:32] <mungbean> is there any money for the metal in old boilers, or they should go straight to the dump?
[11:36] <czajkowski> Laney: you'd like it here
[11:36] <czajkowski> it's snowing
[11:36] <czajkowski> and settling
[11:36] <diplo> mungbean: Only if there is lots of copper
[11:36] <Laney> czajkowski: jealous!
[11:36] <Laney> it's starting to settle here actually
[11:36] <Laney> hope it keeps it up for a few more hours ...
[11:37] <diplo> We've got lots of water settling!
[11:37] <diplo> Bloomin rain!
[11:38] <czajkowski> poxy snow
[11:41] <xnox> mungbean: yes, there is.
[11:42] <mungbean> xnox: taking to scrap yard?
[11:42] <xnox> mungbean: i mean, you can get some money for it as pure scrap metal.
[11:42] <mungbean> by taking to a scrap yard?
[11:42] <xnox> mungbean: but transportation costs might be more than you get out of it. E.g. nobody will come to collect it.
[11:43] <mungbean> fits in my estate car i think
[11:43] <xnox> mungbean: dunno what they are called in British English, but yeah scrap yard that buys metal should do.
[11:43] <xnox> mungbean: call them up first to see if they want it or not =) some scrap yards specialise only in certain things.
[11:44] <mungbean> http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.php?t=2587913
[11:44] <xnox> (e.g. like batteries or electronics only)
[11:47] <xnox> mungbean: if it's made from ferrous metals (like copper) than you will get a lot for it. If there is a lot of disassembly and not much metal, you'll get less =)
[11:47]  * xnox 's dad runs a metal scrap yard ;-)
[11:47] <mungbean> i don't have a big copper cylinder, its just an old combi boiler, will prob take it to the council recycling centre
[11:49] <xnox> =) then council sells them to scrap yard in bulk and gets money =)
[11:50] <Laney> hot squash :>
[11:54] <ali1234> xnox: if only that were true. what will actually happen is the council will pay a company to crush it and then ship it to africa, where it will be dumped in a field, rust, and poison the water table.
[11:56] <xnox> ali1234: scrap metal is up to 98% recyclable, and is traded on exchanges in london and throught the world. I doubt it's metal that's crushed and dumped.
[11:56] <xnox> Plastics often are.
[11:57] <xnox> ali1234: if you know councils that dump metal, get them in touch with me. I'd buy their scrap metal.
[11:58] <mungbean> councils will strip them down and profit in bulk
[11:58] <mungbean> i'm happy to do that
[11:58] <ali1234> that's the thing. you can't just buy the metal from them
[11:59] <ali1234> they throw *all* the garbage into a giant crusher, then put it into shipping containers and send it to foreign countries
[12:00] <ali1234> you see the council has contracts with "recycling" companies
[12:01] <mungbean> i have a friend who works for the recycling team
[12:01] <mungbean> i'll check with him, but pretty sure they strip them here onsite
[12:01] <ali1234> and those companies have contracts with overseas companies who supposedly do the actual recycling, but instead just dump it
[12:04] <mungbean> i know that the reason they fill up ships with plastic bottles and send to china is not for recycling abroad (although they are recycled), but for ballast in the boats as there is massive disparity between imports and exports to china

=== Ruint is now known as Ruin
[15:38] <meet> does aria2c or axel really speed up downloads?
[15:39] <davmor2> meet: only in the same way bittorrent can,  If you have loads of seeds it goes faster than when there are fewer seeds
[15:40] <davmor2> meet: this creates a load of connections to one machine though so depends if the machine is configure to stop multiple downloads from one source how fast that machine is etc
[15:41] <meet> davmor2: so both of them make many to connections?
[15:42] <meet> davmor2: or do they also find multiple mirrors?
[15:42] <davmor2> meet: basically
[15:42] <davmor2> meet: no not multiple mirrors they just download it in parallel rather than serial
[15:44] <meet> davmor2: btw which one is better?
[15:45] <davmor2> meet: pass I only ever used axel years ago
[15:46] <meet> davmor2: :) ok.. btw my updates and downloads through software center senter are vey slow than my normal speed.. what can i do so my full bandwidth is utilised ?
[15:49] <davmor2> meet: USC will use as much bandwidth as is available and that matches the speed of the ppa/repo that you are connected too
[15:51] <meet> davmor2: i used the select best mirror option in the settings. but it chose a server geographically much far away from me. so should i just keep to the default one?
[15:51] <davmor2> meet: possibly

[18:23] <bootkigftrgds> Hi there, Just to let you know, I installed avast for Linux  and got a key and after a few screens I installed Avast Anit-virus and I thought I'd get back in touch. Here is my review .. http://paste.lisp.org/+2VVP hope that helps. Overall score 3/10
[18:24] <zleap> why do you need avast antivirus on Linux ?  or any anti virus in the first place
[18:24] <bootkigftrgds> Ask avast.
[18:25] <MartijnVdS> arrr!
[18:26] <dwatkins> for running Samba to allow people to store their files?
[18:29] <bootkigftrgds> dwatkins: I'm not sure, but I think you did say when I asked about Av for Linux .. ' give it a try & report back to us ' .. so I did .. works Ok , but very minimal TBH.
[18:30] <dwatkins> bootkigftrgds: cool
[18:30] <bootkigftrgds> there must be a market the para'ds among us.
[18:31] <bootkigftrgds> i just like trying new software :)
[18:31] <dwatkins> or those who want to protect other users from themselves ;)
[18:31] <bootkigftrgds> true.
[18:31] <dwatkins> I'd be very surprised if you found any malware within Linux itself, since you've presumably been using the official repositories to install, although there's a chance some 3rd party repo might be compromised, of course.
[18:32] <bootkigftrgds> has anyone actually use the firewall that comes with Ubuntu, 'cos I've never ben able to configure it .. no biggie.
[18:32] <MartijnVdS> dwatkins: when official repos are compromised, there's usually a big news story about it
[18:32] <dwatkins> MartijnVdS: I'm sure there would be, yes
[18:32] <dwatkins> bootkigftrgds: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall
[18:32] <bootkigftrgds> opening...
[18:32] <MartijnVdS> unless you're using a two-user distro of some kind of course
[18:33] <jacobw> the offical repos have been compromised?
[18:33] <dwatkins> no
[18:34] <dwatkins> we're speculating about ways a linux system could end up with a virus or malware
[18:34] <zleap> rootkits mainly i guess
[18:34] <zleap> if you run as root all the time
[18:34] <davmor2> bootkigftrgds: there is bitdefender for linux too that does a gui iirc, install gufw and that is way easier for a gui system
[18:34] <jacobw> :)
[18:35]  * jacobw takes a deep breath
[18:35] <zleap> physical access to a system,  if someone then instlls a key logger somewhere (hardware)
[18:35] <zleap> installs
[18:35] <bootkigftrgds> dwatkins: crumbs, that link is way beyond my ability,is there a book for general purpose firewall , just to get the terminology etc, or is it all on-line ??
[18:36] <jacobw> signed binaries and reasonable passwords, trust keys and certificates, not network addresses
[18:36] <bootkigftrgds> davmor2: Thank, I'll give it a try, late.
[18:36] <bootkigftrgds> **later.
[18:36] <dwatkins> bootkigftrgds: I imagine there are other tutorials for it, it should jsut be a case of installing it then specifically allowing the ports you want to open, though.
[18:37] <bootkigftrgds> Yeah, although I know what ports are, you lost me a specifying what ports I want open ..
[18:37] <jacobw> "all things from this address space are allowed" becomes a liability when that address space has been repurpose a few dozen times :)
[18:37] <dwatkins> repurpose, jacobw?
[18:37] <jacobw> reallocated
[18:38] <davmor2> bootkigftrgds: ufw is a system that uses the firewall build into linux.  The reason it is called uncomplicated Firewall is because it uses pretty much plain english.  However it still needs to be able to do everything that is needed from an industrial grade firewall
[18:39] <dwatkins> can anyone suggest a way to test if a UDP port is listening for a connection? I assume it's effectively pointless to try, since there's no connection established, so unless you get rejected you can't know.
[18:39] <jacobw> 192.168.7.0/24 is for my private servers at that I trust SSH from at time A, then I move my private servers to a public space and reallocate it for a new office LAN, at time B I trust SSH from an office LAN
[18:40] <jacobw> it's just a pet peeve of mine, it's not particularly relevant :|
[18:41] <bootkigftrgds> Wow .. looks like Avast has spring-boarded a popular topic :D
[18:41] <dwatkins> jacobw: what's the annoying part? I don't understand
[18:41] <jacobw> dwatkins: network addresses don't identify trusted things
[18:41] <dwatkins> ah ok
[18:42] <dwatkins> I tend o use ssh keys for that ;)
[18:42] <dwatkins> *to
[18:43] <jacobw> exactly, trusting keys and certificates is so much better
[18:45] <jacobw> soap box time over
[19:02] <kevin> hi all, anyone use skype with unity? why isn't it possible to resize the chat window width to below a certain threshold?
=== kevin is now known as skinofstars
[19:03] <skinofstars> or is that just a skype thing?
[19:05] <popey> i use it, yes
[19:05] <popey> sounds like a skype issue
[19:06] <skinofstars> popey: thought as much. thanks
[19:09] <Whoop> skinofstars: probably unrelated but have you seen skype wrapper?
[19:09] <Whoop> it fixes a load of crappy unity/skype things
[19:12] <directhex> most windows can declare a minimum size to the window manager
[19:13] <skinofstars> Whoop: i have not seen that, no. wil check it out. thanks
[19:13] <directhex> native Skype support in empathy!
[19:14] <skinofstars> directhex: really? does that support voice/video calls and group chat?
[19:14] <directhex> s' not available publicly. sorry.

=== Lcawte is now known as Lcawte|Away
[19:24] <Whoop> native?  I don't belive it, thats not possible unless someone reverse engineered the Skype protocol.  There's no way to communicate with Skype unless you have the official client open then utalise the API
[19:27] <commonWinuser> Hello ?
[19:28] <commonWinuser> Is anyone actually here ?
[19:28] <skinofstars> hi
[19:28] <skinofstars> wassup?
[19:29] <commonWinuser> Hello. Just PC trubles I guess.
[19:29] <commonWinuser> *troubles. (sorry I'm bad at English)
[19:29] <commonWinuser> Would you mind if I ask you for some help ?
[19:29] <ali1234> Whoop: it's possible if you license the skype libraries... then you can integrate it however you want with whatever you want
[19:29] <ali1234> Whoop: see the N900 for an example of how to do it properly
[19:30] <dwatkins> I thought there were security keys involved as well stopping other clients form using skype's service.
[19:30] <ali1234> none of that matters
[19:30] <Whoop> Really?  I thought they had strict licensing on you being able to only do that if there were no official client or some crap
[19:30] <dwatkins> commonWinuser: you can ask, but if you're using Windows, you may not necessarily get a reply ;)
[19:30] <ali1234> there is an official skype library that runs headless
[19:30] <skinofstars> commonWinuser: you should just ask. if anynoe knows the answer, they'll help :)
[19:30] <commonWinuser> Yeah I know but I'm using Linux to fix the laptop.
[19:30] <Whoop> Thats not really native then is it :)
[19:31] <ali1234> what is native then?
[19:31] <commonWinuser> I know very very very... basics of Linux
[19:31] <Whoop> ali1234: implementation of the protocol, no backend closed daemon etc
[19:31] <ali1234> are you going to just redefine what native means until it fits your definition?
[19:31] <ali1234> libskype isn't a daemon... it's a library
[19:31] <ali1234> it isn't open source
[19:31] <ali1234> it is native though
[19:31] <Whoop> you said headless, that implies its running in the background without a head
[19:31]  * Whoop shrugs
[19:32] <commonWinuser> Well guys today my mother booted up the laptop normaly but it kept giving message similar to "Insert proper boot media and press any key to boot"
[19:32] <bootkigftrgds> directhex .. Why doesn't 'sudo apt-get empathy' work on my Lubuntu machine ??
[19:32] <skinofstars> i've not kept up with skype development, but in the past when i've wanted to run 'headless' skype i've ended up with what is basically a minimal x11 env, thn hooking into the api
[19:33] <Whoop> skinofstars: thats what I thought also, so nfi
[19:33] <directhex> bootkigftrgds, because you need to issue an actual command to apt-get, like "install"
[19:33] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: well the things is the laptop worked fine
[19:33] <dwatkins> bootkigftrgds: does it say that you need the word 'install' as well as the application?
[19:33] <directhex> skinofstars, yeah, a proper headless version is written, but nobody wants to pay the associated costs for releasing it
[19:33] <ali1234> 'cept nokia. right?
[19:33] <bootkigftrgds> ok
[19:34] <skinofstars> commonWinuser: the latop works fine with ubuntu?
[19:34] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: It had win7 instaled. And this morning it simply stoped. The laptop had no contact to suspicious websites as mother only watches shows shown on Youtube. And has Eset Nod Smart security instaled
[19:34] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: well here is the thing. this morning that error apeared.
[19:35] <directhex> ali1234, on the N9? yes afaik.
[19:35] <skinofstars> commonWinuser: that's a windows error though, right?
[19:35] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: Because the DVD reader refused to read my Win7 DVD. I made a live boot USB
[19:35] <ali1234> directhex: it's on N900 too
[19:35] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: yes but get this...
[19:35] <directhex> ali1234, yeah
[19:35] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: It boots up and tells me that no OS is instaled.
[19:35] <ali1234> and it's really really good
[19:36] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: And it keeps giving me the error that there is no OS to boot from.
[19:36] <ali1234> as i was saying the other day... canonical should license it
[19:36] <ali1234> it was a killer app on N900
[19:36] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: So I made Ubuntu live boot USB
[19:36] <dwatkins> commonWinuser: if says no OS is present, how does it boot?
[19:36] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: Well Ubuntu runs fine but
[19:36] <dwatkins> or rather 'what' does it boot?
[19:37] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: Gives "/boot/" some .ini file win tries to boot Win but there is no OS
[19:37] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: anyway Ubuntu loads up all is fine and when I try to check the HDD
[19:37] <skinofstars> commonWinuser: do you have a windows recovery disk?
[19:37] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: ... there isn't one
[19:38] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: No... I have win7 instalation disk but reader refuses to read it
[19:38] <skinofstars> commonWinuser: oh, you can't access the hdd at all with ubuntu?
[19:38] <skinofstars> commonWinuser: that doesn't sound good
[19:38] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: No. It is like when windows tells you there are no drivers
[19:39] <skinofstars> commonWinuser: sorry, i don't really know what windows says. i'm in the fortunate position of using debian/ubuntu at work and at home
[19:39] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: And I have no idea what my hardware is. I tried this "sudo lshw
[19:39] <commonWinuser> skinofstars: Well I would use Ubuntu as well but my parents have some... Issues about it...
[19:40] <neuro> commonWinuser: you need to use a windows recovery disc to repair the MBR
[19:40] <neuro> commonWinuser: download one and burn it if your current one is broken: http://www.w7forums.com/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads-t12325.html

[19:43] <skinofstars> heh
[19:43] <neuro> possibly ...
[19:43] <neuro> skinofstars: best thing to get rid of interlopers is quickly google for some info and pass it on
[19:43]  * dwatkins wonders if there's a .ni tld, since there's a .uk not a .gb 
[19:43] <neuro> and when i say "get rid of", i mean "assist politely and in the spirit of sharing"
[19:43] <neuro> dwatkins: there is a .gb
[19:44] <neuro> but the early uk networks already used uk historically in pre DNS addressing
[19:44] <dwatkins> neuro: ok, I should have said that it is actually used by more than a couple hosts ;)
[19:45] <dwatkins> I mean isn't... or something
[19:45] <neuro> hey
[19:45] <neuro> there's THREE hosts in .gb
[19:45] <skinofstars> .ni is Nicaragua
[19:45] <neuro> exactly
[19:45] <neuro> the standard is the ISO3166-1 code
[19:45] <neuro> NI isn't a stanard code
[19:46] <dwatkins> heh, ok
[19:46] <neuro> <- knows stuff
[19:46] <dwatkins> I know, I was just kidding :)
[19:46] <neuro> :)
[19:46] <jacobw> wikipedia does too
[19:46]  * dwatkins is quite familiar with ISO3166, and often refers people to it
[19:46] <neuro> blame jon postel, to be honest
[19:47] <dwatkins> the guy who wrote the RFCs?
[19:48] <neuro> ya
[19:50] <dwatkins> "The Doctor Who Past Doctor Adventures novel Blue Box, written in 2003 but set in 1981, includes a character predicting that by the year 2000 there will be four hundred machines connected to ARPANET."
[19:50] <neuro> and they will weigh less than four tons
[19:51]  * dwatkins grins
[19:52] <neuro> i wish i'd had a go at ARPANET
[19:52] <neuro> but the first time i touched an internet connected machine was 1992
[19:52] <dwatkins> likewise, a much more innocent time, too
[19:52] <neuro> so i missed it by 2 yrs
[19:52] <dwatkins> I had my first foray into the internet in about 1994
[19:52] <dwatkins> I remember seeing someone dial-up in the late 1980s, but that wasn't really internet
[19:53] <dwatkins> telnetting from a BBC Micro
[19:53]  * dwatkins wonders if he can use his beeb as an ssh client
[19:53] <neuro> probably x25
[19:53] <neuro> ha
[19:53] <neuro> probably
[19:53] <neuro> people have hacked tcp onto spectrums and c64s
[19:53] <dwatkins> looks like kermit was available, so perhaps I can do internal-only telnet at home
[19:54] <neuro> closest you'll probably get is a riscos client
[19:55] <neuro> http://nettle.sourceforge.net/
[19:55] <dwatkins> neat
[19:55] <dwatkins> one of the things on my 'someday' shopping list is an A3020
[19:56] <neuro> calls binaries for things it doesn't understand, so just install openssh alongside it
[19:56] <neuro> i have an A5000 sitting under my desk in my wee office
[19:57] <dwatkins> I have red function keys on order for my IBM Model M
[19:57] <dwatkins> I've got RISC OS installed on the Raspberry Pi, so can run arch and beeb stuffs on there
[19:57] <neuro> :)
[19:57] <dwatkins> wow: http://mdfs.net/Apps/Networking/EcoTCP/ReadMe
[19:57] <dwatkins> TCP/IP for the BBC Micro
[19:58] <neuro> i should have known
[19:58] <neuro> ah yeah, thought it would do that
[19:58] <neuro> graft it on top of econet
[19:58] <dwatkins> I have a B+ with all of 64k RAM :D
[19:58] <dwatkins> no idea how likely it is I'll find an econet interface...
[19:58] <neuro> ebay
[19:59] <dwatkins> hmmm, only one on there is for the Master
[19:59] <neuro> http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/blah/150980131663
[19:59] <neuro> yeah
[20:00] <dwatkins> very tempting to get an archimedes, though
[20:00] <dwatkins> anyway, back later, enjoy :)
[20:00] <neuro> :)
[20:00] <neuro> now *I* want an archie, git
[20:02] <mgdm> neuro: get a raspberry pi and run the RiscOS image on it
[20:02] <neuro> that would necessitate actually taking my rpi out the box
[20:02] <mgdm> Yes. Yes it would.
[20:03] <AlanBell> I have a riscos SD card, it was great to have a play with it again
[20:03] <neuro> i do actually want to Do Stuff with mine, but i'm tempted to get another for noodlage
[20:03] <neuro> in fact i'm tempted to get maplin's starter kit thingy once i'm working again
[20:04] <AlanBell> get multiple smallish SD cards
[20:04] <neuro> 75 quid for a model b incl 512MB plus raspian on a 4GB card, plus hub, keyb, mouse, twin USB PSU, A-B USB cable, hdmi, and wifi doobrie
[20:06] <AlanBell> do you need all that?
[20:06] <neuro> well it would be nice
[20:06] <neuro> although admittedly i'd be more interested in a decent wee case
[20:07] <AlanBell> I should get a case at some point
[20:07] <mgdm> the PiBow is quite nice
[20:07] <mgdm> if a little bright :)
[20:07] <AlanBell> http://www.ebuyer.com/130039-kingston-8gb-secure-digital-high-capacity-card-sd4-8gb £3.99 now, SD cards are getting cheap
[20:07] <neuro> i have 2 16s sitting there waiting to be used
[20:08] <neuro> i'm such a lazy goit, i really am
[20:09] <neuro> thing is, i've spent so much time virtualising stuff to not run lots of boxes, running a separate box to do anything seems a bit odd
[20:09] <neuro> so i'd have to find something very particular that would require it to be running standalone rather than virtualised
[20:09] <neuro> and i can't think of a particular use yet
[20:09] <neuro> except for maybe a webcam thingy
[20:10] <neuro> plug a standard usb webcam in one usb port, a wifi dongle in the other, and use it to like capture stuff
[20:10] <neuro> and just need a power socket nearby for usb PSU
[20:10] <neuro> can't think of anything else i'd use it for
[20:12] <neuro> (that was a cue for someone to tell me some awesome interesting thing you'd use an rpi for!)
[20:12] <shauno> I'm using mine as a gateway between router & 3g modem, until Chorus figure themselves out and get me hooked up
[20:13] <shauno> yes there's 'mifi' things that do this properly, but for the sake of a week or two's connectivity, it's just the job
[20:13] <neuro> nice
[20:13] <neuro> chorus ...
[20:13] <neuro> *brrrr*
[20:13] <neuro> chills
[20:14] <shauno> it's that or eircom here, really.  the choice between intentionally evil, and simply inept
[20:14] <neuro> ireland ...
[20:14] <neuro> the digital hub
[20:14] <neuro> except when it comes to doing digital stuff for residents
[20:14] <neuro> but for COMPANIES, come on in, we luv ya!
[20:15] <neuro> i get why broadband is crap in ireland (massively rural legacy telco infra), but still ...
[20:16] <shauno> well, I'm waiting for an appointment to get 100meg in here.  so I can't complain.  I'm just getting the run-around trying to get them moving.  they keep claiming my bank doesn't exist
[20:18] <shauno> I either get the bangalore equivalent of "computer says no", or they just go back to page 1 of the script
[20:18] <neuro> hehe
[20:18] <neuro> unlucky
[20:19] <shauno> on the plus side, my Roomba arrived today, so I feel like a 12yo :)  And already considering brain surgery on it
[20:20] <neuro> lol
[20:20] <neuro> bad enough you have an AI hoover in the house, but *hacking* it?!
[20:20] <neuro> dude, skynet
[20:22] <popey> do they actually work?
[20:22] <shauno> well I went for the cheapest model I could find, and was rewarded with a complete lack of timing/scheduling functions.  which just seems so simple to achieve that it almost seems silly not to try adding it
[20:22] <popey> i quite fancy one
[20:23] <shauno> I'm not sure yet.  it did a fairly entertaining job on its first run, but now I'm obediently giving it an overnight on the charger like the book says
[20:24] <popey> can it trundle around a whole house or does it only do one room at a time?
[20:24] <shauno> it claims it'll do 3 rooms on one charge.  I've yet to try that though
[20:25] <neuro> CAN IT LEVITATE UP THE STAIRS LIKE A DALEK?! *shudder*
[20:25] <shauno> I'm curious how it finds home once it's done three, because the 'beacon' for the base station appears to be optical
[20:25] <popey> does it build an internal map?
[20:26] <shauno> it doesn't seem to, based on the pinball game it played between my tablelegs
[20:30] <mgdm> Hmm
[20:31] <mgdm> I thought that was the point :)
[20:32] <shauno> well, so far all its had is a 10 minute run while I giggled like a child, before I put it on to charge like I oughta.  so very rough first impressions
[20:49] <ali1234> indoor positioning is supposed to be the thing this year
[20:49] <ali1234> (last year it was AR)
=== david__ is now known as zathras_laptop
[21:07] <skinofstars> not sure if anyone can help with this, but my usb mouse doesn't seem to work with the usb3 port
[21:09] <MartijnVdS> skinofstars: strange. does the usb3 port work with anything else?
[21:11] <skinofstars> just tried a usb stick. nuffin
[21:11] <MartijnVdS> skinofstars: nothing detected? (lsusb, dmesg)
[21:12] <skinofstars> yep, nothing on lsusb or dmesg
[21:12] <skinofstars> usb2 seem to be fine
[21:12] <MartijnVdS> I don't know.. don't have any USB3 ports..
[21:21] <directhex> skinofstars, usb3 port on the front of the case, or direct on the motherboard?
[21:24] <skinofstars> directhex: it's a laptop. so on the side
[21:25] <skinofstars> sorry. actually, i am seeing a usb hub on lsusb
[21:25] <skinofstars> but it's returning 'unused'
[21:26] <skinofstars> it didn't say usb without doing lsusb -v
[21:27] <directhex> check your BIOS settings to see if there's anything relevant there
[21:27] <skinofstars> cool. i saw someone on the internets suggestng booting with it plugged in, so i'll check that too
[21:35] <dwatkins> neuro: looks like I can make a straight pass-through RS423-RS232 cable and run 'Tequila' on my BBC Micro to use it as a terminal for my ubuntu machine :)
[21:36] <dwatkins> also, if anyone wants to be a DALEK... http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/VERY-RARE-DALEK-SUIT-from-the-BBC-TV-serial-DR-WHO-/261154307591
[21:37] <skinofstars> it's odd. mouse works in usb3 port if it's booted with is plugged in
[21:38] <skinofstars> i might have to play around with different kernels to see if it's an upstream issue
=== Lcawte|Away is now known as Lcawte
[22:57] <Seeker`> ali1234, A sign appeared in the communal entrance to day 'is anyone having any problems with sky in this block?'
[22:59] <ali1234> so it's the distribution system?
[22:59] <ali1234> or did you put the sign up?
[22:59] <ali1234> when was the last time your nova-t worked?
[23:01] <Seeker`> I didn't put it up, someone else did
[23:01] <Seeker`> someone else wrote on the sign 'I do' (or words to that effect)
[23:01] <Seeker`> Friday
[23:05] <ali1234> so, seems like the distribution system has blown up then
[23:12] <Seeker`> possibly
[23:12] <Seeker`> weird that some TVs work though
[23:17] <StevenR> Seeker`: maybe there's a chain of distribution devices, and only one has blown up
[23:17] <ali1234> yeah
[23:17] <ali1234> i don't know how to explain that satellite and terrestrial both broke at the same time though
[23:27] <Seeker`> ali1234, I imagine they are both sent over one wire to the flat, and split out inside fo the flat
[23:27] <ali1234> could be
[23:28] <ali1234> the wall plate might just be two sockets on the same piece of wire
[23:28] <Seeker`> StevenR: I can run a TV through the socket that my Nova-T 500 can't get a singal through, and a 290e USB stick gets a singal from that socket too
[23:28] <Seeker`> it might be that there is an amplifer somewhere int he distribution chain that has blown up
[23:29] <daftykins> as far as i understood, dish feeds tend to carry voltage and standard aerials don't
[23:29] <ali1234> there's no reason the standard aerial doesn't
[23:30] <ali1234> mine does :)
[23:30] <ali1234> cos i have a masthead amp
[23:30] <ali1234> an LNB isn't really all that different
[23:30] <ali1234> but in any case, if the signal is being split out from a distributor then there won't be any DC on either socket
[23:31] <ali1234> anyway this speculation is pointless. call the super and get it fixed :)
[23:32] <ali1234> the wires around the building are probably enough to pick up a weak signal even if the main aerial is broken
[23:32] <ali1234> for terrestrial that is
[23:32] <ali1234> not for satellite obviously
[23:33] <ali1234> if you managed to get a signal with the mini aerial you must be quite close to the transmitter
[23:33] <Seeker`> yeah, not far
[23:33] <daftykins> Seeker`: was it you i was talking to that had a mythtv setup that suddenly lost all channels?
[23:34] <Seeker`> possibly
[23:39] <Seeker`> also, does anyone know where I put my signal booster?
[23:40] <daftykins> what's that GRUB boot fixing CD people often recommend?
=== Lcawte is now known as Lcawte|Away
[23:50] <ali1234> super grub rescue or something
[23:50] <ali1234> http://www.supergrubdisk.org/
[23:51] <daftykins> i figured it might be :) thanks ali1234
[23:51] <ali1234> honestly i just use ubuntu live cd usually
[23:51] <ali1234> and just reinstall grub from scratch
[23:54] <daftykins> yeah, it's for some guy helping his sister
