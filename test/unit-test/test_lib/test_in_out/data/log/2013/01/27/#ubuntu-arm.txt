[13:07] <marvin24_> mmh, is there some rule where to install device trees for a multi-board kernel and how to name them?
[13:07] <marvin24_> /boot/devicetree-<machine>-<kernelver>.dtb?
[13:08] <marvin24_> if you install more than one kernel, there will be lot of these devicetree files ...
[13:09] <ogra_> marvin24_, ask ppisati tomorrow
[13:09] <marvin24_> arrr, always these weekend hackers ...
[13:09] <ogra_> je is just working that out for ubuntu kernels
[13:09] <ogra_> *he
[13:10] <marvin24_> well, kernel package could be clever to detect the machine and install only the desired one
[13:11] <marvin24_> but all need to be packaged
[13:11] <ogra_> that's what he works on
[13:11] <ogra_> afaik
[13:16] <marvin24_> ok, great

[21:11] <Phosphate> Does anyone have experience with 13.04 on a Nexus 7? Is it possible to use the soft keyboard during setup or do you need a micro usb host adapter for a keyboard?
[21:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> no
[21:27] <Tassadar> you can use software keyboard
[21:31] <Phosphate> Tassadar: Thanks. Is there something you need to do to make it work? I get the keyboard on screen when I focus on a text box but nothing shows up in the textbox as I type.
[21:32] <Tassadar> I'm afraid that is a bug - try to reboot the tablet
[21:32] <Phosphate> Ah ok thanks. Will give that a shot.
[21:37] <Phosphate> Tassadar: Thanks, it worked on the second reboot.
