[02:38] <agrestringere> Hello, how do I get a list of all the packages that certain Ubuntu community team is responsible for so I can get an overview?
[05:45] <mfisch> How do I tell if someone is running Ubuntu server or desktop? Someone filed a bug against 8.04 and it's already EOL for desktop I think.
[05:46] <micahg> mfisch: decide based on package
[05:46] <mfisch> micahg: gnome-terminal says desktop to me
[05:46] <micahg> I'd tend to agree :)
[05:47] <mfisch> micahg: but a package like "tar" would apply to both, so we'd have to support it until Server was EOL?
[05:47] <micahg> yeah
[05:47] <mfisch> perfect, thanks micahg
