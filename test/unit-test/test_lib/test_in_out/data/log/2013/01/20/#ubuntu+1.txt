[14:30] <BluesKaj> Hey folks
[14:41] <penguin42> Hey
[15:37] <BluesKaj> hey penguin42 , hoe goes the battle ?
[15:38] <BluesKaj> err how
[15:38] <penguin42> yeh ok
[15:39] <penguin42> I'm currently hitting my lack of understanding of Windows trying to get a reflashing tool to work under wine to unbrick a little ARM board
[15:46] <BluesKaj> raspberry pi ?
[15:47] <penguin42> nah, an MK809 - much more powerful than a Pi
[15:48] <penguin42> can run a hacked Ubuntu install; 1GB RAM, dual core 1.2GHz CPU (on a good day) - although in my case currently bircked, and the firmware rewrite if you really screw it up needs this annoying windows ap
[15:48] <BluesKaj> anyway gotta reboot into the new kernel ..hope it holds together
[15:50] <john___> What does it take to browse my UpNP (DLNA) collection using Dolphin?
[15:50] <john___> Kubuntu 13.04 btw
[15:50] <drhalan> hey i was wondering what filebrowser you guys are using. nautils is really unusable in 3.6... however i cannot find marlin or nemo in the repos
[15:52] <penguin42> john___: I don't know, but you might see if Kaffeine can browse it - it seems to be able to play back pretty much everything else
[15:54] <john___> penguin42: Using VLC it works, but I was wondering if Kubuntu has some sort of UpnP support, as my devices do not show up in Amarok either
[15:58] <penguin42> john___: Not sure, I've not got any upnp stuff - but I'd be kind of surprised if it didn't
[16:14] <MrChrisDruif> BluesKaj; youÄºl let us know how it goes right?
[16:17] <BluesKaj> I got back ok after the new kernel install , mr
[16:17] <BluesKaj> MrChrisDruif,
[16:17] <MrChrisDruif> So you've finally managed to install Kubuntu 13.04 BluesKaj ?
[16:19] <BluesKaj> MrChrisDruif, yes , installed 12.10 on this partition and upgraded via internet , thereby bypassing the ubiquity bug
[16:20] <MrChrisDruif> Huzzay!
[16:25] <BluesKaj> fortunately the nvidia driver is working fairly well , considering ...
[16:27] <BluesKaj> the kde upgrade also helped a lot
[16:31] <BluesKaj> bbiab
[16:47] <drhalan> anyone knows what the plans for gwibber in raring are? development seems to have slowed down even more...
[16:50] <penguin42> one in raring is currently 3.6.0-0ubuntu2
[18:09] <ShawnRisk> How do I tell update manager of new linux kernel version, I installed? Update Manager is tell me to update to 3.2.0 when I know my version is 3.7.3 when I do uname -a in terminal on Ubuntu 12.10
[18:20] <patdk-wk> ShawnRisk, that isn't an *update*, that is an backport
[18:21] <patdk-wk> this is the wrong channel for 12.10 anyways
[18:21] <ShawnRisk> patdk-wk: which channel should I be on?
[18:21] <patdk-wk> #ubuntu?
[18:21] <patdk-wk> this is for 13.04
[18:23] <ShawnRisk> I tried there and they said to try here and also it is not something we support.  All I am asking is how to make it so the update manager knows I am using kernel 3.7.3
[18:25] <jtaylor> remove the 3.2 kernel
[18:25] <jtaylor> or just install the update and run update-grub to get it to 3.7 again
[18:26] <ShawnRisk> that will not help
[18:27] <jtaylor> why wouldn't it?
[18:27] <jtaylor> you can also just pin your kernel package
[18:29] <ShawnRisk> jtaylor: I have to download the 3.2.0 kernel for no reason.  Pin my kernel package?
[18:30] <jtaylor> if you haven't got 3.2 installed update manager should not update it
[18:30] <jtaylor> update-manager only updates what is there
[18:30] <jtaylor> it would only pull new stuff if something depends on 3.2
[18:30] <jtaylor> which should be unlikely
[18:31] <ShawnRisk> but I still see that there
[18:37] <ShawnRisk> I have to go so thanks for the help
[19:34] <uccio> win
[21:30] <DreadKnight> this fail issue with 13.04 regarding libmp3lame... as the package is named libmp3lame0 and the video editing apps don't recognize it because of that and render the videos without audio *sigh*
[21:30] <DreadKnight> what can I do?
