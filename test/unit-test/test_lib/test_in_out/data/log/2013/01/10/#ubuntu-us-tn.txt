[01:33] <iamblackface> hello tennessee :o
[01:34] <chris4585> hello iamblackface
[01:37] <iamblackface>  might anyone have some free time to help me out with a general linux wireless question :D
[01:42] <chris4585> sure
[01:42] <chris4585> I'm not an expert, but someone might know
[01:43]  * chris4585 pokes wrst and cyberanger 
[01:43] <iamblackface> im trying to find a command to quickly find the channel of a give network
[01:43] <iamblackface> im using "iw dev wlan0 scan" but that is way too slow
[01:44] <chris4585> lol that is a cyberanger question
[01:44] <iamblackface> poo
[01:44] <chris4585> he is the local network guru dude
[01:48] <Unit193> Hrm, can't you use iwlist for that?  I've actually only used iwscanner to graph it. :P
[01:53] <iamblackface> pretty sure iwlist is slow too, im trying to make a realtime scanner
[01:53] <iamblackface> just using a bash script
[01:53] <iamblackface> just to test antennas
=== average_guy is now known as rfinley
[03:27] <cyberanger> iamblackface: "sudo iwlist $INTF scan|less"
[03:28] <cyberanger> $INTF = wireless interface, typically wlan0
[03:29] <cyberanger> typically that's faster, but it won't be instant, if you've done a scan recently though, don't use sudo, and it'll just repeat the last results
[03:42] <iamblackface> thank you cyber :o
[03:54] <rfinley> acc off
[03:55] <rfinley> oops
