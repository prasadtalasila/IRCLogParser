[02:25] <r4y> I need help with saving a file to a floppy disk. I see the floppy disk drive but I can't open it, and it has been years since I last used a floppy disk drive. It says: Unable to mount location No media in the drive
[02:26] <r4y> I just tried another floppy disk and it says the same thing
[02:27] <r4y> In disk utility it says smart staus not supported. Perhaps I need to turn smart of?
[02:28] <r4y> status not staus
[02:28] <r4y> Well it couldn't hurt since I had smart on this motherboard turned off before. Bye
[02:30] <escott> i love the idea of a floppy with SMART. that would be awesome

[04:31] <yeehi> Just installed  Gnome. I know wireless card works ok with free software and the wireless router signal is ok. I cannot reach internet. NetworkManger.conf has be set to managed=true and restarted. It says wireless is unavailable in network manager gnome. Aeroplane mode is off. Wireless is set to on. No wireless networks have been detected. How can I get to the internet?
[04:47] <holstein> yeehi: i would hardwire and search for firmware
[04:51] <yeehi> thanks, holstein - this wireless card doesn't need special firmware - it runs on Trisquel, the fully free version of Ubuntu
[04:52] <holstein> yeehi: i would try different firmware, kernels... i would test with live CD's
[04:52] <holstein> yeehi: i would connect via wired to troublewhoot
[04:53] <holstein> shoot*
[04:53] <holstein> yeehi: i would setup an open wifi access point
[04:53] <yeehi> oh - a different kernel might work! Good idea. will try wired connection too
[04:53] <holstein> yeehi: also, trisquel is not ubuntu
[04:54] <holstein> yeehi: you might want to try ubuntu/xubuntu/lubuntu if just for troublshooting purposes to aide setting up trisquel, assuming you get no help from the trisquel community
[04:55] <yeehi> trisquel runs fine, holstein. (I am actually trying to run Wheezy Debian Gnome at the moment, but don't know the debian community well - Ubuntu people I know are helpful)
[04:56] <holstein> yeehi: sure.. its just helpful for us to help you if you are actually using ubuntu
[04:56] <holstein> yeehi: im not getting into what "better" or what runs "fine" or not.. just that ubuntu has kernels.. im familiar with them.. i dont know anything about trisquel
[04:57] <holstein> yeehi: it literally wont hurt to fire up a live CD.. if it works, you can see what is loaded and learn how to support the device in most any linux
[04:57] <yeehi> trisquel uses the libre kernels - same as linux, but with no binary blobs, holstein
[04:57] <holstein> yeehi: they are *not* the same
[04:58] <holstein> yeehi: ubuntu ships no proprietary blobs
[04:58] <holstein> yeehi: again, it literaly will not hurt you to try it.. otherwise, you'll need to familiarize yourself with those communities
[04:58] <yeehi> it does ship blobs, holstein, ubuntu uses the standard linux kernel, which has blobs
[04:58] <holstein> yeehi: nope
[04:59] <holstein> yeehi: either way, we dont need to argure about this
[04:59] <holstein> yeehi: the kernels are *not* the same.. and the operating systems are diferent
[04:59] <yeehi> i am confident that there are blobs in the kernel ubuntu ships with, holstein
[04:59] <holstein> yeehi: im *not* suggesting you need to use ubuntu.. nor that it is better
[04:59] <holstein> yeehi: im suggesting as a troubleshooting step, you load a live CD..
[04:59] <yeehi> for linux kernels without blobs you can go here: http://jxself.org/linux-libre/
[05:00] <holstein> yeehi: i am positive ubuntu doesnt ship proprietary software
[05:00] <holstein> yeehi: we on the ubuntustuio team are not allowed to ship codecs or blobs... for anything.. out of the box
[05:00] <holstein> yeehi: that comes from high up
[05:00] <holstein> yeehi: again.. nothing we need to debate
[05:00] <holstein> yeehi: im not saying you should.. im saying in order to get support in an ubuntu support channel, you should try ubuntu on the hardware
[05:01] <yeehi> you are right, holstein, no proprietary software, but binary blobs are different - they are "open source", ie we can see the binary code, but it is un-intelligible, therefore not free
[05:01] <holstein> yeehi: again.. nothing to debate
[05:01] <holstein> yeehi: those are not in by default
[05:01] <holstein> yeehi: and, it literally will not hurt you to try a live CD and see how the software is supported
[05:02] <yeehi> yes, holstein, it was a bit cheeky of me to ask for help on the ubuntu-beginners channel, but ubuntu is debian based and i feel like a noob, so ubuntu people might have mercy on me :)
[05:02] <holstein> yeehi: i do
[05:02] <holstein> yeehi: im asking you to load a live CD so i can have an idea of whats going on
[05:02] <yeehi> a live cd of debian?
[05:02] <holstein> yeehi: ubuntu..
[05:03] <holstein> if it works in ubuntu, you can likely find out why easy enough
[05:03] <yeehi> i have done that already, holstein - ubuntu runs ok and connects to internet with quantal
[05:03] <holstein> yeehi: so, whast the problem?
[05:03] <holstein> yeehi: fire up that live CD, and see what it has that you need in the other operating systems
[05:05] <holstein> yeehi: if you are saying "something in ubuntu is a blob that is supporting my hardware, and i dont want to use that blob, i want to use something else to provide support *and* in another operating system".. i dont think any of the volunteers will be willing to learn a new operating system to help you enough
[05:07] <yeehi> holstein, thanks for helping me: 1) ubuntu quantal and precise run well and auto connect to wireless on this laptop. the blobs on the linux kernel that these 2 releases ship with are not an influence on whether this laptop connects to the internet. (I know this, as I have used the same kernel, stripped of the blobs and the wireless works ok)
[05:08] <holstein> yeehi: then, use that kernel
[05:08] <holstein> yeehi: otherwise, its something in those operating systems that you are not configureing properly
[05:08] <yeehi> I am using a kernel with blobs at the moment - the blobs are not the issue here
[05:08] <holstein> yeehi: i *never* thought any blob was an issue
[05:10] <yeehi> i agree, holstein - you never thought blobs were an issue for me, though I think you did say that ubuntu does not come with non-free software, when I believe that in fact it does, namely, the kernel, which has blobs.
[05:11] <yeehi> But anyway, I will go check out with Gnome/Debian people. They will have had more experience with this particular issue, I think
[05:11] <holstein> yeehi: i still say they are opensource.. i politely disagree with your asscessment of the blobs
[05:11] <yeehi> open source does not equal free.
[05:11] <holstein> yeehi: they are free or not.. we cant include non free. and they are inclued
[05:12] <holstein> yeehi: cool.. hope you get it sorted!
[05:12] <yeehi> thanks holstein! It is good to be able to chat with somebody that cares!
[05:12] <yeehi> If i see you later when I get it going, i will let you know :)
[05:13] <holstein> well, you have it "going" in 12.10 and 12.40 ubuntu.. but cheers to you with debian
[05:13] <holstein> 12.04*
[05:29] <holstein> yeehi: i have more/better information about the blobs.. not sure if you actually need one
[05:30] <holstein> those blobs are needed to be sent to talk to the hardware
[05:30] <holstein> if you need it, you'll need it on whatever OS
[05:30] <holstein> if you dont, then its configuration
[05:30] <holstein> there is nothing software you can do to need the blobs less
[05:30] <holstein> they are what they are, and if you need them, you need them
[05:31] <yeehi> Thanks, holstein
[06:16] <bodhizazen> 'lo yeehi and coolbhavi

[23:53] <PhysicsBrain> Hello? Can I make a question?
[23:53] <PhysicsBrain> Hello guys! I've aproblem with the "sudo". Posteriorly i did edited /etc/sudoers/, i can not do nothing as sudo user. Exist in anywhere a file "sudoers" backup, to just put in there?
[23:54] <PhysicsBrain> Can anybody help me?
[23:55] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: you want to edit the file from a live CD? or the recovery root console?
[23:56] <PhysicsBrain> I would like edit in the graphic mode, normal! can you understand?
[23:57] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: the live CD is "normal"
[23:57] <PhysicsBrain> I need to a recuperation of the file "sudoers" because i broken the existent and cant's do nothing as a sudo user!
[23:58] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: that should also be on the live CD
[23:59] <PhysicsBrain> i have the 12.04 LTS live CD and I'm using the 12.10 QQ, I can use it?
[23:59] <holstein> PhysicsBrain: to edit the file? sure
