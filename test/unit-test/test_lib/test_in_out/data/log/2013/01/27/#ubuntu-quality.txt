[08:47] <rajeevbhatta> Hi
[08:47] <rajeevbhatta> I am trying to install QT toolkit on ubuntu 13.04
[08:47] <rajeevbhatta> to set my sys for ubuntu mobile development
[08:49] <rajeevbhatta> but I get errors during installation, I think this is a bug in ubuntu..just wanted to check with others if they have experienced the same installing qt5 on raring nightly
