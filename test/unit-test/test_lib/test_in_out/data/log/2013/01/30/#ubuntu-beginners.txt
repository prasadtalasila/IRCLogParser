[03:25] <IveBeenBit> If I'm trying to format a USB flash drive from the command line, should the drive be mounted or unmounted?
[03:30] <AnthonyUK> im a newbie but i read this just an hour ago...
[03:30] <AnthonyUK> " In Linux the floppy drive or other device must be "mounted". That means basically, incorporating it temporarily into your Linux file system or, in other words, telling Linux that it is a file to be written to or copied from."
[03:30] <AnthonyUK> source: http://www.linux.org/article/view/linux-file-systems
[03:33] <AnthonyUK> farther down that page I think it mentions the importance of unmounting drives before shuting down as shuting down unmounnted drives can cause file system to be trashed
[03:33] <AnthonyUK> shutting down mounted drives *
[03:33] <AnthonyUK> hope that helps
[03:40] <IveBeenBit> AnthonyUK, thanks. Yeah I have been searching for it, but last night I was trying it both ways and it did not want to format. I wound up having to download a graphical doohickey to do it, but I want to learn other ways as well.
[03:46] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: hello
[03:47] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: i just formatted a usb drive the other day. I think I found the guide I used. http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/17001/how-to-format-a-usb-drive-in-ubuntu-using-gparted/
[03:50] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: you can also use the app 'Dish Utility' installed by default. Gparted used in the previous guide mentioned needs to be installed. http://askubuntu.com/questions/68809/how-to-format-a-usb-or-external-drive
[03:50] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit:  the second guide seems pretty easy.
[03:50] <duanedesign> lots of pictures too :)
[03:53] <IveBeenBit> duanedesign, I actually finally accomplished it with gparted in fact, but am frustrated that I couldn't get it to work in the terminal. I'm trying to get better at CLI stuff so when I run into a problem, I tend to keep beating my head against the wall and asking questions until I solve it.
[03:54] <IveBeenBit> Also I'm trying to learn the file system. The idea of mounting stuff confuses me a bit. Like mounting external drives, mounting IMG files and so forth.
[03:56] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: it is a little bit of a learning curve but once you get used to the terminsl you will love it.
[03:57] <IveBeenBit> duanedesign, right. I keep telling myself that. So can I ask you about mounting/unmounting a USB drive, as an example?
[04:01] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: I had this page bookmarked. i hope it helps https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
[04:02] <IveBeenBit> Just glancing at it, I think it will. I'll give it a thorough read shortly. Thank you.
[04:02] <duanedesign> Their is a link a t the botom to a page for usbs
[04:02] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: yeah it is a bit wordy :)
[04:03] <AnthonyUK> anyone know of an easy to follow guide for sharing folders so win7 can see them, previously i had a win7 homeserver and all of the shares were not passworded and read only
[04:04] <duanedesign> AnthonyUK: let me see if I have  guide bokmarked on that.....
[04:05] <AnthonyUK> cool i think i got chmod down so i can make it so anyone can view the file in linux, just gota get my head around samba now
[04:05] <AnthonyUK> after that i gota mount my 2 x 1TB ntfs drives
[04:08] <duanedesign> I had this bookmarked....Hope it helps. I think I also have one specifically on Samba http://www.7tutorials.com/how-access-ubuntu-shared-folders-windows-7
[04:09] <AnthonyUK> TY duanadesign
[04:11] <duanedesign> AnthonyUK: whaat verion of Ubuntu are you running?
[04:11] <AnthonyUK> ubuntu 12.04 lts server edition
[04:15] <duanedesign> AnthonyUK: aha, i think this was written for 12.04 and has a lot of good links https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Samba
[04:19] <duanedesign> AnthonyUK: I have a few other links. I dont want to overwhelm you with links(info). If you run into any specific questions let me know and i will look and see what I got.

[08:34] <ssdeol> hello everyone
[08:35] <ssdeol> is there anybody can help me changing ftp user password on ubuntu ftp server???????
[08:35] <ssdeol> is there anybody can help me changing ftp user password on ubuntu ftp server???????
[08:35] <ssdeol> is there anybody can help me changing ftp user password on ubuntu ftp server???????
[09:09] <Super_Dog> which ubuntu FTP server are you using?
[09:10] <Super_Dog> There are many possibilities...
[09:34] <duanedesign> hello Super_Dog
[09:43] <duanedesign> Super_Dog: alot of people use filezilla because t is cross platform and a gui.
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[09:46] <duanedesign> Super_Dog: gftp has a command line and a gui version if you need a solution for your server and dont want, or need, a gui
[09:50] <duanedesign> if you are implementing in a  cross platform enviroment filzilla is nice, it also supports sftp. If you are using Ubuntu Server and need a CLI solution gftp is a good choice. IMHO
[13:19] <JonEdney> I'm often running into system freeze ups while running 12.10 on my HP laptop.  By freez ups I mean where the program I will be using (usually FireFox, XChat & Thunderbird) will darken to indicate they are not responding.
[13:19] <JonEdney> I'm running an AMD A6-3420M 1.5 GHz Quad-Core on 8 GB Ram, on board graphics.  Anyone know how I could look into this?

[20:16] <bizhanMona> HI I am planning to use ubuntu 12.10. What type of  utilities are available to get info on  hardware devices and configuration of the system? And changes to the system configuration, e.g hotplug? Thx
[20:17] <holstein> bizhanMona: the live CD is nice
[20:18] <holstein> bizhanMona: i usually just fire one of those up and test devices.. i run "lspci" and/or "lsusb" ...maybe "aplay -l" or "arecord -l"
[20:18] <holstein> most things just work, but when they dont, it can be tricky
[20:19] <bizhanMona> holstein: Thanks so much. I am also interested to know whether dbus provide those type of info, and if not is it possible to enable it? Thx
[20:20] <holstein> bizhanMona: enable what?
[20:22] <bizhanMona> holstein: okay so if there be any changes to the hardware configuration, e.g. usb insertion/removal. I get a notification through dbus. Sorry if it is not clear ....
[20:24] <holstein> bizhanMona: you get whatever notifications the operating system have setup, or that you want to setup
[20:24] <holstein> bizhanMona: usually, with the *buntu distros, you get a popup by default
[20:24] <holstein> i dont know of one that doesnt, except ubuntuserver of cours
[20:24] <holstein> course*
[20:25] <holstein> bizhanMona: the live CD will let you see that.. its a nice resource to run a live CD and see pretty much exactly how the OS will run on your hardware
[20:27] <bizhanMona> holstein: this exactly what I like to know. do you know the process(es) which detect and notify (i.e. pop window)? thx
[20:27] <holstein> bizhanMona: you put it in, the system "sees" it, and does what it is supposed to do
[20:28] <holstein> usually, auto-mounted or showing in the filemanager
[20:28] <holstein> the "nuts and bolts" of this, i have not really looked into
[20:28] <holstein> there is a package (or more) for notifications.. different notification systems notify differently
[20:28] <bizhanMona> holstein: thank you so much you have been very helpful
[20:28] <holstein> bizhanMona: cheers
