[13:54] <rick_h_> http://ssaboum.github.com/meta-deps/ cool
[13:55] <snap-l> Wow, that's pretty sweet
[13:55] <snap-l> I love the red dot near the center: setuptools
[14:29] <rick_h_> lmao https://twitter.com/rkkski/status/288956938778189824/photo/1
[14:29] <rick_h_> not sure how real that is, but that's great!
[14:35] <snap-l> http://vimcasts.org/episodes/long-range-line-duplication/
[14:35] <snap-l> This just got me to turn on line numbering in my vim editor
[15:33] <snap-l> God, I love PYthon
[15:34] <snap-l> nothing major, just seeing some elegance.
[15:34] <rick_h_> the more you know the prettier it gets
[15:34] <snap-l> Looking at the QuickWIki tutorial, and the way they find the wikiwords in a document is quite elegant.
[15:35] <snap-l> wikiwords = re.compile(r'\b([A-Z]\w+[A-Z]+\w+)', re.UNICODE)
[15:35] <snap-l> later...
[15:35] <snap-l> titles = set(wikiwords.findall(content))
[15:35] <snap-l> (from http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pylons-webframework/en/latest/tutorials/quickwiki_tutorial.html)
[19:42] <snap-l> Not sure if anyone of you plays Magic the Gathering (I personally couldn't care less) but apparently Guild of Blades is now a sanctioned Wizards of the Coast location, and has Friday Night Magic tourneys
[19:42] <snap-l> They also have Munchkin Tournaments.
[21:29] <jcastro> rick_h_: why do people like rugs
[21:29] <jcastro> "I got us an entrance rug!"
[21:29] <jcastro> No, you got a dirt attractor that covers my beloved OAK FLOOR.
[21:42] <rick_h_> lol
[21:43] <snap-l> Man, I love this song.
[21:43] <snap-l> http://metalinjection.fm
[21:43] <snap-l> Diablo Swing ORchestra
[21:43] <snap-l> jcastro: I like rugs in moderation
[21:43]  * snap-l knows that will come back to bite him someday.
[21:44] <jcastro> sure, I like small rugs, for the shoes and whatnot
[21:44] <jcastro> but don't cover real wood. It's like, my new thing.
[21:45] <jcastro> oh god, I'm becoming rick
[21:45] <snap-l> We all get there someday.
[21:45]  * snap-l slips jcastro the rick_h_'s anonymous card
[21:46] <snap-l> Call ahead for meeting times
[21:47] <rick_h_> jcastro: yea, I'm with you
[21:47] <rick_h_> but then again not everyone puts in a nice wood floor, just a cheap one
[21:47] <rick_h_> and some people *gasp* don't appreciate the look of a nice wood floor
[21:47] <rick_h_> see every bit of 'modern' furniture made of plastic/composites/etc
[21:47] <jcastro> they should be killed
[21:47] <snap-l> That's like not appreciating air
[21:48]  * rick_h_ starts printing snap-l's card as well :P
[21:48] <snap-l> Good for 1 free throttling
[21:49] <snap-l> Hey, I like wood
[21:49]  * snap-l knows that will come back to bite him someday.
[21:49] <snap-l> Apparently I just love wood and rugs
[21:49] <snap-l> and cheap plastic
[21:49] <brousch> enough about your fetishes. This is a family channel
[21:50] <snap-l> (sorry)

[21:51] <snap-l> Oracle: the gift that keeps on giving
[21:53] <jcastro> Java was making people suffer long before oracle came around
[21:53] <jcastro> they just make it feel better when you do so
[21:53] <snap-l> I don't remember this level of security tom-foolery
[21:55] <snap-l> Seriously, they should just open up the code, give it to Apache, and just build Sun hardware.
[21:55] <snap-l> this is ridiculous
[21:55] <jcastro> nope
[21:55] <jcastro> I'm pretty sure no one wants Sun hardware anymore either. :p
[21:55] <snap-l> jcastro: Apparently someone is buying them
[21:57] <jcastro> People buy meth too
[21:57] <jcastro> http://www.jorgecastro.org/2013/01/11/juju-and-maas-for-human-beings/
[21:57] <snap-l> Probably the same set
[21:57] <jcastro> BEHOLD MY VIDEOS

[22:07] <snap-l> I've been beta-testing this.
