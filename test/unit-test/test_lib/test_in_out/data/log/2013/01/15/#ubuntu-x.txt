[08:27] <mlankhorst> RAOF: fwiw, bug 1086345
[08:27] <ubottu> bug 1086345 in lightdm (Ubuntu) "Quantal-LTS-stack: Showing low-resolution screen on shutdown/reboot" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086345
[08:27] <mlankhorst> exactly as I feared...
[08:31] <mlankhorst> This won't work unless libdrm gets haswell support. Since the whole reason for doing a libdrm rename was for plymouth to use the old version, can we please drop the libdrm rename and go back to uploading a new libdrm unrenamed?
[08:58] <mlankhorst> RAOF: ^
[09:36] <RAOF> mlankhorst: I'll send a mail to ubuntu-release. We might be able to come up with a better plan, but I'll lay out the problem. Specifically - plymouth needs the new libdrm haswell support to work on haswell.
[09:47] <mlankhorst> ah k
[09:48] <mlankhorst> fwiw, I always kept that option open, it's not going to be hard to flip the switch on all the lts packages if we decide not to rename libdrm any longer
[09:58] <tjaalton> Â¤&/" useless totem firefox plugin.. needs to download the video file completely before playing, and playing again of course means downloading the file again..
[10:01] <mlankhorst> :')
[10:49] <mlankhorst> yay on rebase tons of patches I needed are no longer needed :)
[11:05] <mlankhorst> argh, then I hit a lockdep inversion with efifb, but if I disable efifb macbook blows up.. great
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[12:03] <mlankhorst> ok found fix, found another problem exposed by fix.. sigh
[13:09] <soren> Have any of you guys tried running X in an LXC container?
[13:10] <mlankhorst> not crazy :)
[13:11] <soren> Perhaps a more relevant question is: What is the expected success rate of the Raring X stack on a Precise kernel?
[13:12] <soren> Or Quantal for that matter.
[13:12] <tjaalton> there's the backport stack in 12.04.2
[13:12] <tjaalton> and it should work with the older kernel too
[13:13] <soren> tjaalton: What I'm really trying to do is see the various desktop environments availalble in Raring, without messing up my Precise laptop.
[13:13] <soren> tjaalton: So a Rarin X stck on Precise doesn't really help me much.
[13:14] <tjaalton> hmm
[13:17]  * soren tries something
[13:23] <mlankhorst> then this is obviously the wrong channel
[13:23] <soren> It seems to work!
[13:23] <soren> I was just missing some device nodes in the container, apparently.
[13:24] <soren> Keyboard and mouse doesn't work, but meh.
[13:24] <soren> Progress.
[13:24] <tjaalton> so running raring on a container, using the host xserver?
[13:24] <soren> No no.
[13:24] <tjaalton> oh both
[13:24] <soren> Precise host, raring lxc.
[13:24] <soren> Running X inside the lxc.
[13:25] <soren> So the only "precise" part involved is the kernel.
[13:25] <tjaalton> you need /dev/input/* on the container
[13:25] <soren> Everything else is raring.
[13:25] <soren> I have that.
[13:25] <soren> Not sure why that isn't enough, but I can go digging now.
[13:25] <tjaalton> ok
[13:25] <soren> Thanks!
[13:26] <tjaalton> for what? :)
[13:27] <soren> Um... For not breaking it? :)
[13:28] <tjaalton> hehe
[14:28] <mlankhorst> hmz for some reason DRI_PRIME=1 fps shot up.. not complaining :D
[14:40] <Mez> Has anyone managed to get a 12.10 box up and running with 3 screens using an nvidia card?
[14:42] <Mez> unity just falls over if the compositing is disabled.  and if it's enabled - it doesn't work correctly... (invisible windows!)
[14:43] <mlankhorst> I thought nvidia only supported 2 screens at a time?
[14:44] <mlankhorst> on 1 card
[14:44] <Mez> mlankhorst: on one GPU. 
[14:44] <Mez> mlankhorst: I'm using an nvidia quadro
[15:52] <mlankhorst> Mez: nvidia drivers? 
[16:42] <Mez> mlankhorst: yup

[20:31] <ejat> anyone or someone can verify that ? 
[23:17] <mlankhorst> RAOF: I guess the xorg bug close means the entire lts stack got promoted to -updates? :)
