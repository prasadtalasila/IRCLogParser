[19:09] <bcurtiswx> is there a place that LoCo's can store online documents they have like flyers
[19:10] <SergioMeneses> bcurtiswx, sure! take a look http://spreadubuntu.org/
[19:10] <SergioMeneses> it is a public store
[19:13] <bcurtiswx> SergioMeneses, it can be specific to our LoCo it doesn't have to be global ?
[19:15] <SergioMeneses> bcurtiswx, do you need something local?
[19:15] <bcurtiswx> Were creating a flyer for an installfest
[19:17] <czajkowski> bcurtiswx: best to share
[19:17] <czajkowski> then others can help you
[19:17] <czajkowski> you can help others
[19:18] <czajkowski> there is no private way
[19:18] <czajkowski> unless you are using Ubuntu one ?
[19:18] <SergioMeneses> Im thinking the same
[19:18] <SergioMeneses> using a ubuntu one account
[19:18] <bcurtiswx> czajkowski, oh no, we totally want to share, we wanted to know if there was a place , thats all :)
[19:18] <SergioMeneses> or dropbox or something like that
[19:19] <czajkowski> spread ubuntu is the best place then 
[19:19] <bcurtiswx> seems like spreadubuntu is what we're looking for :) thanks
[19:21] <SergioMeneses> bcurtiswx, dont worry :D
[19:54] <cprofitt> hello all
