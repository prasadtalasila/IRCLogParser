[11:40] <glen> does launchpad offer two way git<>bzr syncing of repos?
[11:57] <maxb> No
[12:03] <glen> did it offer one way?
[12:08] <maxb> LP can import remote git repositorie into bzr branches using bzr-git, subject to the limitations of that extension
[12:29] <glen> ok, seems if i apply small patch to disable graphs in bzr-fastimport, i can do two way sync using git-bzr-ng https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/541626

[15:16] <stokachu_> hey, im attempting to do some oauth authorization through ruby and when i send a post request to grab a request_token i get a 403 forbidden b/c launchpad.net requires a referer heading
[15:16] <stokachu_> i've attempted to manually set referer in the http headers but no luck
[15:17] <stokachu_> the form has csrf protection enabled and usually that is enough but i think launchpad is special in requiring this referer option
[15:20] <stokachu_> from what ive read its the browser that is supposed to set the referrer but this happens in both firefox 18 and chrome 23
[15:26] <stokachu_> im curious if i have to setup a redirect
[16:03] <ertai_NL> can somebody help me with getting a patch into a launchpad-project?

[19:16] <bpa> Hi all
[19:17] <bpa> I would to know if it's possible to install a packge version which have been superseded
[19:17] <bpa> and how :)
[20:21] <mapreri> bpa: maybe this is not the better channel to ask it. Anyway, in debian-based distros you can do so by installing the package using dpkg and than pin it in /etc/apt/preference (see man 5 apt_preferences). Or, if you use only the gui, in synaptic there is the option "force version" and then "Pin version" (I think, I don't use synaptinc anymore...)
[21:31] <maxb> bpa: The answer hinges on whether the old versions are still listed in the repository's index, i.e. its Packages file.
[21:32] <maxb> I'm fairly sure LP doesn't list multiple versions in there, though I think there's been talk of keeping old versions around for a short while
[21:33] <maxb> If a version is gone from the index, APT-type tools won't be able to know about it to download it, but the possibility of manually seeking out the appropriate .deb file(s) still exists - they aren't purged from disk immediately
[22:44] <stewart> hi! we have someone who keeps reassigning bugs and changing statuses and they're not involved in the project (and they're not changing them in a way that makes us think they're actually trying to contribute)
[22:54] <lifeless> stewart: are they responding to requests to stop ?
[22:54] <stewart> lifeless, no, not that i've seen.
[23:00] <lifeless> stewart: (and note that commenting in a bug they mutilated may not notify them)
[23:00] <stewart> lifeless, ahh... that's... unexpected.
[23:00] <lifeless> stewart: so when I worked on LP, the answer was - try a polite direct message via 'contact this user'
[23:00] <lifeless> stewart: and if that fails, open a ticket reporting them for abuse.
[23:00] <stewart> lifeless, ack
[23:00] <lifeless> stewart: we don't autosubscribe folk to third party bugs
[23:01] <lifeless> stewart: e.g. if you comment on a linux kernel bug, you won't be notified on every subsequent change everyone else makes.
[23:01] <lifeless> stewart: these users that make lots of 'helpful' changes are often in that bucket - they haven't opted in for notifications
[23:02] <stewart> lifeless, this is the user: https://launchpad.net/~diazalejandra2008
[23:02] <stewart> lifeless, totally doesn't look legit :)
[23:04] <lifeless> yeah
[23:05] <lifeless> direct message, then abuse ticket
[23:05] <stewart> lifeless, oh yeah, the first message I see is a mail to a bug: "invitation to connect on linkedin"
[23:05] <lifeless> stewart: heh, correlation not causation :)
[23:06] <stewart> lifeless, yeah. couple of messages to bugs, then request to join core team.
[23:06] <stewart> lifeless, I'll just sit here and be paranoid about people wanting to trojan our software
[23:07] <lifeless> a request to join core, on that basis? Fan-person
[23:10] <jotape> Does anyone speak spanish?
[23:13] <lifeless> jotape: millions of people.
[23:17] <jotape> and you?
[23:22] <lifeless> jotape: I do not.
