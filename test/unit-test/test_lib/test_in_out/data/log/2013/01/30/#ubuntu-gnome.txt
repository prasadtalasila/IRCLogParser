[03:35] <jbicha> ooh, make distcheck doesn't even work g-c-c from git master
[03:41] <darkxst> jbicha, works fine here under jhbuild
[03:42] <darkxst> seems to need colord-gtk though
[04:05] <jbicha> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587869/
[04:39] <jbicha> I can't figure it out, I'll have to ask for help tomorrow

[14:35] <jbicha> darkxst: oh I don't need make distcheck, just make dist
[14:38] <ricotz> jbicha, hi
[14:40] <jbicha> ricotz: I couldn't figure out how to build the tarball last night but I think I got it now, I won't have time to do much until tonight though
[14:41] <ricotz> jbicha, oh, just uupdate the 3.7.4 package and refresh the patches
[14:41] <ricotz> jbicha, i might can take a look at it later today
[14:42] <ricotz> just gnome-desktop3 and colord updates are needed
[14:43] <ricotz> bbl
[17:39] <Castial> I had a driver issue and it dropped to gnome 2d, how do I get it to drop to gnome 2d with the driver enabled
[17:39] <Castial> I cant choose it at the login screen
[17:39] <Castial> whats the command
[20:20] <jbicha> darkxst: I filed https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692896 because I'm having trouble building g-c-c outside of jhbuild
[20:20] <ubot5> Gnome bug 692896 in Sharing "sharing: make distcheck fails" [Critical,Unconfirmed]
[20:26] <darkxst> jbicha, ok, I will try have a look a bit later
[22:06] <ricotz> jbicha, this is just missing from extra_dist
[22:11] <ricotz> jbicha, http://paste.debian.net/plain/230624
[22:19] <jbicha> ricotz: oh cool, can you add that to the GNOME bug?
[22:20] <ricotz> jbicha, uploaded a new tarball http://people.ubuntu.com/~ricotz/g-c-c/
[22:31] <ricotz> jbicha, added, this will only fix the "sharing" part
[22:31] <ricotz> network is missing a bunch of POTFILES.* references
[22:40] <jbicha> ricotz: that policy file should be translatable
[22:40] <ricotz> jbicha, no, not this one ;)
[22:40] <ricotz> the in.in was added already
[22:42] <jbicha> ricotz: ok
[22:42] <ricotz> do you have a refreshed packaging around?
[22:49] <ricotz> jbicha, ^
[22:52] <ricotz> good night
