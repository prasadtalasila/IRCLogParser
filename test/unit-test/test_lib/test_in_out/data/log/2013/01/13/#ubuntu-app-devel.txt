[11:47] <sonda> hello
[11:47] <sonda> i want to write my own application in ubuntu
[11:47] <sonda> i know c,c++
[11:48] <sonda> how to get started?
[11:49] <sonda> my idea is to write a note taking application which will integrate with some database may be mysql... i am not sure
[11:50] <sonda> to provide facilities like find as you type, tags, etc..
[11:52] <sonda> right now i use zim... its nice but it doesn't have search as you type feature
[11:55] <tsimpson> you should decide if you want to write a GTK+, GNOME, Qt, KDE, or fancy-pants QML application first
[11:57] <sonda> i can learn qt quickly i guess
[11:59] <sonda> which one is the most widely used?
[11:59] <tsimpson> it's hard to say, but I would speculate that Qt is the most widely used
[12:00] <tsimpson> I'm one of those Qt fanatics though, so I may be biased
[12:00] <sonda> is it free
[12:00] <sonda> or i would need license?
[12:01] <tsimpson> it's free
[12:01] <tsimpson> you only need a license if you plan on changing the Qt source and not sharing those changes (closed-source proprietary applications)
[12:02] <sonda> No I am not that intelligent
[12:02] <tsimpson> but it's LGPL, so you can use it freely for open-source stuff
[12:02] <sonda> I want to use my free time productively. so thinking of starting with something
[12:02] <sonda> i have never done such things before
[12:03] <sonda> but my inner voice says I can do it
[12:03] <tsimpson> you likely already have the Qt libraries installed, you just need the development packages with an "apt-get install qt-sdk"
[12:03] <sonda> any website for help
[12:03] <tsimpson> then you should see the Qt Creator IDE installed
[12:04] <tsimpson> http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/
[12:04] <sonda> i have heard qt can be used on many platforms
[12:04] <sonda> specific to qt on ubuntu any website
[12:05] <sonda> or the os doesn't matter?
[12:05] <tsimpson> you don't need to know anything specific really, it's designed so you write the same C++ code and it works everywhere
[12:06] <sonda> can i get help here regarding coding
[12:06] <tsimpson> http://developer.ubuntu.com/ may have some more info, but last I checked some of it's links for Qt were out of date
[12:06] <tsimpson> you can ask here, but this channel is rather.. dead
[12:06] <tsimpson> there is #qt though
[12:07] <sonda> oh i see
[12:10] <sonda> thanks simpson
[12:11] <sonda> hope to see you soon, when i am stuck with something
[12:12] <tsimpson> well I'm also in #qt so I'll probably see any questions you ask ;)
[12:12] <sonda> cool :)
[12:15] <sonda> one more thing
[12:15] <sonda> for database can i use mysql
[12:15] <sonda> i think it comes with ubuntu right?
[12:17] <tsimpson> I don't think it comes with ubuntu by default
[12:17] <tsimpson> there is SQLite installed by default though
[12:17] <sonda> oh i see
[12:18] <sonda> it might be sufficient right?
[12:18] <tsimpson> it likely is
[12:18] <tsimpson> there's also that couchdb/desktopcouch thing that ubuntu likes to use
[12:19] <sonda> whats that
[12:19] <sonda> do i need any special learning for that
[12:19] <tsimpson> "RESTful document oriented database" apparently
[12:20] <tsimpson> it's not SQL as far as I know, so you'd need to get to grips with whatever API it uses
[12:20] <tsimpson> but SQLite is always there, and Qt has built-in support for SQLite too
[12:20] <sonda> ok
[12:24] <sonda> which ide u use for coding
[12:25] <tsimpson> depends on my mood and the scale of coding I'm doing, either just a plain text editor like kate or nano, or I use Qt Creator
[12:26] <tsimpson> and maybe kdevelop now it's getting stable again
[12:27] <sonda> any ide that has intellisense?
[12:28] <tsimpson> Qt Creator has code completion, yes
[12:29] <sonda> ok great
[14:08] <sohail_> hey guys, I'm trying to install both libssl-dev and libssl-dev:i386 on 12.04 but I get the following error: http://paste.lisp.org/display/134608 - I need to build against both 32 and 64-bit :(
[14:09] <sohail_> (it's a conflict)
[14:10] <sohail_> anyone know how to fix it?
[14:13] <sohail_> damnit: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=689093
[14:13] <ubot2`> Debian bug 689093 in libssl-dev "libssl-dev is not Multi-Arch compatible" [Normal,Open]
[14:24] <christoffer> Hi, I'm trying to use Glade to design a Toolbar with "Text beside icons" but it doesn't seem to work. "Text below icons" works just fine.
[14:24] <christoffer> anyone know if there is a known bug reported for this?
[14:28] <christoffer> aha, had to mark the toolbutton "important"
[14:28] <christoffer> that doesn't make sense :P
[15:45] <wed_> hi
[15:46] <wed_> i have a question about packaging for the ubuntu software center: does the package to upload be a .deb file? if so, how do i create one? i dont use the pygobject api.
[18:26] <ziyadb> Good day all!
[18:26] <ziyadb> Glad to see the number of users in this channel.
[18:27] <ziyadb> I'll be a regular from here on as I am working on developing a heavily customized app.
[18:27] <ziyadb> I'm also new to the platform :D
[22:38] <JanC> ziyadb: thanks for staying and wanting to become a regular; too many people just drop in, ask a question, and leave again before anybody can answer...   :-/
[22:38] <JanC> I guess it's not obvious for everybody dat IRC != instant messaging
[22:40] <JanC> also, we need a lot more users to make the channel more active  â˜º
[23:10] <dually> I see that qml can call XMLHttpRequest(); with GET parameter.  Is it possible to POST as well?
