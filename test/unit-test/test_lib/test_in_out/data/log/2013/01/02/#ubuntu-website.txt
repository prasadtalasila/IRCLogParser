[15:30] <robin-gloster> daker & cjohnston: mhall119 told me to ping you to check some changes i made on ubuntu-community-webthemes for ubuntu-accomplishments-web to invalidate client-side cache. would the changes interfere with other sites? https://code.launchpad.net/~robin-gloster/ubuntu-community-webthemes/caching
[15:32] <robin-gloster> btw i don't know if the people responsible for the countdown on ubuntu.com are here, but it doesn't run on chrome dev channel
[15:33] <mhall119> robin-gloster: what is "chrome dev channel"?
[15:33] <mhall119> antdillon: ^^
[15:34] <robin-gloster> mhall119: 2 versions ahead of current release, in this case version 25
[15:36] <antdillon> robin-gloster, Oh really, mmm ... that's odd Its is being replaced in 2 hours
[15:36] <antdillon> robin-gloster, Thank you for the heads up
[15:37] <robin-gloster> antdillon, your welcome, i recon it's not that bad because it runs on current release
[15:38] <antdillon> robin-gloster, Yeah that's my thinking but good to know browsers its not working on
[15:38] <robin-gloster> antdillon: yup and maybe for future countdowns ;)
[15:38] <antdillon> robin-gloster, Will use modernizr next time for a fall back
[16:24] <daker> antdillon: it does not update the countdown : Chromium Version 24.0.1312.2 Ubuntu 12.04 (165266)
[16:25] <antdillon> daker, Thank you, I'll look into it
[16:27] <antdillon> daker, That is two versions ahead of the latest version
[16:27] <antdillon> daker, Due to the short time it will be on the site I note it but dont think a fix will be developed in time
[16:36] <daker> antdillon: ok
[16:48] <daker> antdillon: just to let you know you should use v1.6.1 to fix it
[16:57] <daker> robin-gloster: how do you get the {{version_hash}} ?
[16:57] <antdillon> daker, Thanks, were updating the jquery version soon so wont have this issue again.
[16:59] <robin-gloster> daker: custom template context processor which sets the global template variable to the latest bzr rev number
[17:05] <daker> robin-gloster: i don't think your changes should go into lp:~mhall119/ubuntu-community-webthemes/django-stricter-nav-elements
[17:05] <daker> cjohnston: right ?
[17:05] <robin-gloster> daker: we currently pull the theme from that branch
[17:06] <mhall119> robin-gloster: we should update that, those changes are in the main branch for the theme now
[17:06] <mhall119> there's no need to pull from my branch now
[17:07] <robin-gloster> should i make a merge proposal for the main branch?
[17:08] <mhall119> robin-gloster: yes please
[17:09] <daker> robin-gloster: yeah would be better also, i would prefer {{ revno }} instead of {{version_hash}}
[17:10] <daker> robin-gloster: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/#template-style
[17:11] <robin-gloster> daker: ok can change those. otherwise it is fine?
[17:13] <daker> robin-gloster: you need to get a fresh branch otherwise you will get merge conflicts, because the part you are changing have been modified by cjohnston
[17:13] <robin-gloster> daker: ok
[17:24] <cjohnston> robin-gloster: you need to do an {% if version_hash %}?{{ version_hash }}{% endif %}
[17:25] <robin-gloster> cjohnston: if it isn't present only a '?' gets appended to the url.
[17:28] <robin-gloster> cjohnston: shall i add the if?
[17:29] <cjohnston> As long as it wont effect current sites, its fine
[17:37] <robin-gloster> cjohnston: pushed a new branch
[17:38] <cjohnston> ack
