[00:00] <univyrse> ok I pretty much already described my problem
[00:00] <univyrse> I can reiterate though if you want
[00:01] <ikonia> univyrse: you're unmuted, so if you could stop sending me threats in pm about getting me butt hurt etc, and just calm down, I'm happy to explain the problem
[00:01] <univyrse> that was a long time ago
[00:01] <univyrse> before you adopted this weird ass waiting room policy
[00:01] <univyrse> dont you have timestamps
[00:01] <univyrse> wait nvm, ANYWAYS
[00:02] <univyrse> i was discussing the incredibly relevant ubuntu phone
[00:02] <ikonia> univyrse: the #ubuntu channel is for ubuntu support discussion,
[00:02] <univyrse> i need support for the phone
[00:02] <ikonia> it also has rules about how people behave in there such as language, topic, etc
[00:02] <univyrse> i cant get my apps to work
[00:02] <ikonia> univyrse: ubuntu phone hasn't been released
[00:02] <univyrse> screen wont rotate either
[00:02] <ikonia> so there is no support,
[00:02] <ikonia> as I suspect you know
[00:02] <univyrse> it says insert windows 7 disc
[00:02] <univyrse> and read mein kampf back to front
[00:02] <univyrse> idk what it means
[00:03] <univyrse> how do I reset it to factory default
[01:52] <ubottu> xangua called the ops in #ubuntu (DudeFace)
[01:53] <bazhang> yeah that'll pass
[04:05] <Ben65> one guy talking to himself with two sort of "clones", tom- tom` and tam-
[04:05] <Ben65> don't know the goal here, but it sure is annoying
[04:09] <ubottu> Ben65 called the ops in #ubuntu ()
[04:12] <Flannel> Ben65: I think they're separate people.  If they aren't, they know how to hide it so we can't tell.
[04:13] <Ben65> they're not separate, they have similar names and joined at the same time, and are talking to each other, not to mention they're almost all offtopic
[04:13] <Flannel> Ben65: Everything except the last bit isn't important.
[04:14] <Ben65> well i didn't think there is a rule against clones, but their main goal seems to be filling the channel with unnecessary banter
[05:40] <elky> btrfs can't possibly still be "new". unstable sure, but not new.
[13:58] <ubottu> In #ubuntu, averangeall said: ubottu: bug 1 is cool lol
[14:18] <Pici> Anyone know what mnice is on about?
[14:21] <io> trolling clearly
[14:21] <Pici> io: I didn't realize that was you until just now.
[14:21] <io> :)
[14:25] <Pici> fwiw, I don't see him in the access list in #ubuntu-cz
[14:26] <io> he said forums.
[14:26] <io> might be something to look into?
[16:28] <Tm_T> hi mr realname
[20:39] <Mez> Oh great elders of IRC, I beseech the - do you know of a channel for the Ubuntu Community Team ?
[20:39] <Mez> Or do I harass^Wpoke^Wcontact members individually
