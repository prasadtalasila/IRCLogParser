[03:11] <micahg> hrm, rejecting in the +queue UI doesn't allow one to give a reason?
[03:12] <infinity> micahg: Neither does the CLI.  There's nothing for it in the API or DB.
[03:13] <micahg> oh, hrm, how do people give reasons when rejecting then?
[03:13] <infinity> Email.
[03:13] <infinity> Or IRC.
[03:13] <micahg> doesn't matter in this case as I rejected my own upload
[03:13] <infinity> Or not at all. :P
[03:13] <micahg> infinity: what's the story with sagari?
[03:13] <infinity> micahg: The sagari that's been doing all the PPC builds for the last few hours?
[03:14] <micahg> yes
[03:14] <infinity> The story is it's there, it works, and I'm stress-testing it.
[03:14] <micahg> I'm wondering how it compares to the current builders and/or sulfur
[03:15] <infinity> And that it got to flip the bird to two x86 buildds when it finished gcc-4.8 before they did.
[03:15] <infinity> It doesn't compare at all.
[03:15] <infinity> Or, rather, they can't compare to it.
[03:15] <micahg> I think you just answer my question, that rocks :)
[03:15] <infinity> Think 13.5h for linux-ppc versus 1h or so.
[03:16] <infinity> Or a more fun number, 27m for firefox.
[03:16] <infinity> (This was test-building on a 3.8 kernel, it does seem a tiny bit slower on precise/3.2, but still plenty fast)
[03:16] <micahg> wow, vs 1.5 hrs, that really rocks
[03:16] <infinity> 1.5h?
[03:17] <micahg> hrm, raring 19 beta takes 2.5 hrs on i386
[03:17] <infinity> Yeah.
[03:17] <infinity> And, for some weird reason, 4h on amd64, but that may have just been a grumpy buildd.
[03:18] <micahg> quantal 18.01 was 4.5 hrs on amd64 and i386, I'm wondering why it got slow all of the sudden
[03:18] <micahg> which version built in 27m?
[03:18] <infinity> Current raring.
[03:18] <infinity> 19+whatever.
[03:18] <micahg> wow, so 5x over x86, I think I need to consider switching to PPC
[03:19] <infinity> IBM so needs to make another cheap desktop form-factor workstation when POWER8 comes out.
[03:21] <infinity> How to builds compare to x86 really depends on the upstream makefile.
[03:21] <infinity> On single-threaded or poorly-parallelised stuff, the machine is still a tiny bit faster than x86 (which is still shiny).
[03:21] <infinity> But the more you can jack up the concurrency, the more it shines.
[03:21] <infinity> Only 6 cores, but SMT4, so 24 concurrent threads.
[03:22] <micahg> wow, 3x more threads than I have :)
[03:22] <infinity> Yeah, it's not awful for IBM's bottom-of-the-line option.
[08:59] <tjaalton> I've uploaded sssd updates for precise and quantal some time ago (after the MRE got accepted), but they're still on the queue

[11:15] <ogra_> hmpf, still no arm livefs buildd in sight
[11:22] <Laney> ogra_: has anyone checked with IS?
[11:23] <ogra_> Laney, according to ChrisS (yesterday) it is likely in the process of being moved and he couldnt give any ETA
[11:23] <ogra_> though it is being mobved since 4 days now it seems

[18:50] <blitzkrieg3> SpamapS: hi, is there a chance we can get the packages in bug 1080588 uploaded to -proposed?

[18:52] <infinity> blitzkrieg3: s/uploaded/accepted/ ?
[18:52] <infinity> blitzkrieg3: I was going to get to reviewing in a while.
[18:52] <blitzkrieg3> infinity: right,
[18:53] <blitzkrieg3> infinity: sorry, I'm a little unfamiliar with the inner workings
[18:54] <blitzkrieg3> cool, we're trying to get this in as soon as possible because this is going to cause major problems when we release 12.04.2
[19:01] <infinity> blitzkrieg3: I'm aware.
[19:18] <SpamapS> I'll do a little SRU run right now actually
[19:19] <SpamapS> need a mental break from other stuff
[19:25] <tjaalton> would be happy to see my sssd uploads get some attention, hint hint nudge nudge ;)

[21:05]  * infinity looks at account-plugin-fitbit in the queue and wonders if this is the first time he's ever seen a package with a version of simply "1".
[21:07] <infinity> kenvandine: ^-- Not that I have issues with it, but... Really? :)
[21:07] <stgraber> infinity: it's not alone, see "esteid" and "libsyntax-highlight-engine-simple-languages-perl" :)
[21:08] <infinity> stgraber: It makes it damned hard to click certain elements of the Soyuz web UI. :)
[21:08] <infinity> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/account-plugin-fitbit <-- I dare you, click the package version!
[21:09] <stgraber> infinity: that's easy with a trackpoint, not sure how easy it'd be with a touchpad though
[21:10] <infinity> [1] citation needed
[21:10] <stgraber> infinity: you could just send a LP patch to: if len(source_version) == 1: source_version = "yeah-really-just-%s" % source_version
[21:10] <infinity> stgraber: Hah.
[21:21] <kenvandine> infinity, indeed... i told cwayne that i didn't really like the version... but he is upstream :)
[21:22] <kenvandine> not the first package i've seen like that
[21:22] <infinity> kenvandine: Oh well.  It won't be 1 forever. :P
[21:22] <kenvandine> right :)
[21:23] <kenvandine> i couldn't think of a good reason to make him change it
[21:23] <infinity> There is no good reason.  Just that knee-jerk developer "eww, really?"
[21:23] <kenvandine> right
