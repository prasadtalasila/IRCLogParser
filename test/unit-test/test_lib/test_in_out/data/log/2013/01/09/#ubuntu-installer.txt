[05:17] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1097570 in grub2 (Ubuntu) "grub2-signed can not find the right device when there are two filesystems containing the file '.disk/info'." [Undecided,New]
[05:18] <FourDollars> it will be appreciated if you could fix this in Ubuntu 12.04.2.

[17:12] <cjwatson> bdmurray: Yes, unlikely to be able to fix for 12.04.2
[17:13] <cjwatson> It's a fairly hard problem

[18:01] <xnox> Segmentation fault (core dumped)
[18:02] <xnox> =/ at least first bug is now solved =)
[18:06] <stgraber> xnox: segfaults with python are so much fun ;)
[18:07] <stgraber> though you can probably just blame pitti, python modules shouldn't lead to segfaults of the interpreter ;)
[18:07] <xnox> stgraber: first time for everything =) well I am EOD, going to pop up and get a birthday present and then will be back to trace that =))))))
[18:08] <stgraber> it's a fairly common problem with gobject-introspection, a lot of gir modules require you to call some kind of class.new() function instead of just class(), not using new() leads to segfault (I remember that from Xkb at least), I still think it doesn't make sense but oh well

[19:09] <plars> xnox: ever seen something like bug #1097890
[19:09] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1097890 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "encrypted swap reused from previous install when wiping and reinstalling" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1097890
[21:52] <xnox> plars: =)))) nope I didn't see that. By default we reuse swap (well, why not right?!) but with encryption options added this may no longer be helpful at all. I wonder if this is reproducible with the server image as well.
