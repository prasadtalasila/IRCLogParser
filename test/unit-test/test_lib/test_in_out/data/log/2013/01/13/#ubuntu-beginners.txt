[04:19] <cj_> I need help.  I have recently installed Ubuntu 12.10 as a dual OS with Windows 7.  I had to re-install my dvdrw drive on Windows 7.  After doing so when I tried to run Ubuntu it now goes to a black screen and does not load.  Any Ideas?

[06:08] <yeehi> full disk encryption is meant to reduce performance. How much would it be effected on a system running on a SSD?
[06:09] <holstein> yeehi: i would say you'll just have to try it and see

[06:10] <yeehi> thanks, holstein

[06:55] <yeehi1> Unity in quantal doesn't have a 2D version, so it ran very slowly in Virtual Machines. Has this been fixed now? Does quantal run fast in VirtualBox?
[06:58] <mysteriousdarren> yeehi1: yes but I used lubuntu 12.10 in my VMs
