[02:42] <ronnoc> Hey all. Opened a bug report on BKO about constant K3b crashing and got a response about Ubuntu using an antiquated version of FFMpeg. I would post elsewhere but since the Devs seem to think that this might be the reason for the crash, I'm posting here as well.

[08:07] <Quintasan> Can has not broken --list-missing implementation
[08:29] <Quintasan> Riddell, ScottK: maliit-framework is done with the exception of tests, in 0.93.0 they did not run because of lack of X session (xvfb didn't help - they crashed) and in 0.94.0 they do not compile (unless I'm doing something wrong). Do you think it's possible to get maliit in without tests?
[09:38] <Riddell> Quintasan: yeah that should be fine
[10:02] <Quintasan> I'd still like a final review Riddell

[13:13] <wakeup> Hello everyone,
[13:13] <wakeup> I am currently translating documents into Turkish.
[13:13] <wakeup> When I follow the link Help Translate on Launchpad, it suggested me translating oneiric templates. I almost complete translations, but today I saw another translations of kubuntu-docs on Raring trunk list.
[13:13] <wakeup> Should I continue the translation with oneiric (https://translations.launchpad.net/kubuntu-docs/oneiric/+lang/tr) or did I waste my time by not translating Raring files (https://translations.launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+lang/tr/+index?batch=75&memo=150&start=150)? Because I cannot see my old translations in Raring files.
[13:22] <wakeup> any replies?
[13:25] <tsimpson> wakeup: it's a weekend, give it some time ;)
[13:26] <wakeup> hehe :). but I would like to complete translations for 13.04 release :)
[13:27] <wakeup> if I translated the wrong release, then I dont have enough exciteness to translate the new version again :/
[14:07] <Riddell> hi wakeup 
[14:07] <wakeup> hello
[14:07] <Riddell> wakeup: docs havn't been updated for raring but we expect SteveRiley_ to do so soon
[14:07] <Riddell> so probably not worth translating yet
[14:07] <wakeup> hmm.
[14:08] <wakeup> so should I continue with oneiric?
[14:08] <Riddell> that's only worth doing if someone bothers to package it after
[14:08] <Riddell> which I'd do but you'd need to poke me to make sure I do it
[14:14] <wakeup> ok, because probably I can make it till 13.04
[14:14] <wakeup> thank you
