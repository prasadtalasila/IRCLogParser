[06:05] <vorsorken> Just upgraded to 12.10. I noticed that a keyboard shortcut that I defined in 12.04 using Settings Manager -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts no longer works. It was Ctrl+Shift+z, but now it says <Primary>z and when I try to redefine it, it keeps reverting to that.
[06:05] <Guest4328> unsupported back-ports would be.... updates for an earlier version of xubuntu, but haven't been tested and confirmed 100% with my ver(12.04)?
[06:05] <entreri> hello, any plan to integrate Ubuntu One et al. into future releases ?
[06:06] <Cheri703> entreri: you can install ubuntu one
[06:06] <Cheri703> vorsorken: primary is ctrl apparently, you should be able to set it as primary shift z
[06:06] <Cheri703> or whatever
[06:08] <vorsorken> When it prompts for the shortcut keys, it shows primary then shift, but as soon as I add "z" it gets rid of shift and is left as primary+z
[06:08] <Guest4328> I always had to do them real slow, and hold.. gl
[06:12] <Cheri703> that is weird, I'm playing with it
[06:13] <Cheri703> I was able to set up ctrl alt t the other day and it was fine
[06:13] <Guest4328> try your other ctrl, or 'primary'?
[06:13] <Guest4328> maybe there is a conf you can just edit it in plaintext
[06:13] <vorsorken> the other control actually causes the shortcut to get deleted...weird
[06:14] <Cheri703> ctrl alt should work
[06:14] <vorsorken> yeah control alt + whatever seems to work fine
[06:14] <vorsorken> I found an xml file in .config somewhere

[06:14] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1055810 in xfce4-settings (Ubuntu) "Cannot create keyboard shortcuts" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[06:14] <vorsorken> if I edit that by hand, what do I need to do to get it to load?
[06:14] <vorsorken> just log out and back in?
[06:15] <Guest4328> yes. backup beforehand though
[06:16] <Cheri703> It only shows that 5 people (well, 6 now that I hit it) are affected, so log in to launchpad and mark it as affecting you
[06:17] <vorsorken> will do, thanks

[06:17] <atom1sk> So ubuntu is a real resource hog, this dist runs great on this old comp. very happy
[06:37] <genoobie> hey all
[06:37] <genoobie> I have an xubuntu live CD that has a working display / x11
[06:37] <genoobie> and an lubuntu install that does not...
[06:38] <genoobie> I don't know if the x11 is different from the login screen to the DE
[06:38] <genoobie> but anyhow, I am going to boot xubuntu live
[06:38] <genoobie> and see if I can pump the X11 stuff from xubuntu into lubuntu
[06:41] <well_laid_lawn> genoobie:  have you had a look at the X log from the instal ?
[06:41] <well_laid_lawn> might tell you about the faail
[06:41] <well_laid_lawn> s/aa/a/
[06:42] <genoobie> well_laid_lawn, not yet.
[06:42] <genoobie> well_laid_lawn, let me boot up the xubuntu live and see if I can poke around a bit
[06:43] <well_laid_lawn> I'd start there - might be an easy fix
[06:44] <genoobie> well_laid_lawn, here's an idea
[06:44] <genoobie> the splash screen comes up okay
[06:44] <genoobie> it's only the dm that seems busted atm
[06:44] <genoobie> so if I log in and startx, and it works
[06:45] <genoobie> that should tell me something, no?
[06:45] <genoobie> I have a puppy linux that recognizes the video
[06:45] <genoobie> so I copied the xorg.conf to the /etc/x11
[06:46] <genoobie> and it changed the appearance of the dm page
[06:46] <genoobie> but it was still not working
[06:46] <well_laid_lawn> you should be able to have X start without a xorg.conf so just remove/rename that
[06:47] <genoobie> yes, there wasn't one in there when I copied it over.
[06:47] <genoobie> xubuntu live is starting (almost 25 min later)
[06:48] <well_laid_lawn> I'd check the log instead of trying to guess at a solution
[06:49] <genoobie> okay, I will check there first
[06:50] <genoobie> well_laid_lawn, now, xubuntu has started
[06:50] <genoobie> how do I find out the driver details?
[06:50] <well_laid_lawn> if you had successfully run startx the last time you booted you'll need to check Xorg.0.log.old
[06:51] <genoobie> maybe I am not making myself clear...I have an install  of lubuntu and xubuntu is live
[06:51] <genoobie> I want to use the working xubuntu to fix the lubuntu install
[06:51] <well_laid_lawn> yep so you have to mount the installed os's partition and check the log in there
[06:52] <well_laid_lawn> it could be the dm's conf that is wrong or something else so you have to find what's causing the problem
[06:54] <genoobie> well_laid_lawn, I'm a bit dense, so I am looking in X11.log old
[06:54] <genoobie> what am I looking for??
[06:55] <well_laid_lawn> errors in the X log are marked with EE so mount the installed os's root partition
[06:56] <genoobie> okay, E SAVAGE (0): DRI isn't enabled
[06:57] <well_laid_lawn> open the file manager in the xubuntu live cd and it should show the partition on the left
[06:57] <genoobie> choose mode 117 at 60 Hz
[06:57] <well_laid_lawn> ok
[06:57] <genoobie> yep, I'm looking at the log
[06:57] <well_laid_lawn> the error should be near the end of the log
[06:58] <genoobie> first problem, (EE) failed to load module "xaa" (module does not exist, 0)
[06:58] <genoobie> first EE
[06:59] <genoobie> open /dev/dri/card0 no such file or directory
[06:59] <well_laid_lawn> start at the bottom and work up
[06:59] <genoobie> okay, from the bottom..
[06:59] <well_laid_lawn> make sure you have the log that reflects a failed X start
[07:00] <genoobie> no, I don't think x fails to start
[07:00] <genoobie> it just looks like the wrong mode
[07:00] <genoobie> there is wacko video on the screen...
[07:00] <well_laid_lawn>  genoobie | I have an xubuntu live CD that has a working display / x11
[07:00] <well_laid_lawn>              │      genoobie | and an lubuntu install that does not...
[07:01] <genoobie> yes, true
[07:01] <genoobie> the display is not working, i.e. there is an x-start but it appears to be goofed (in lubuntu)
[07:01] <genoobie> only on the dm screen
[07:03] <genoobie> okay
[07:03] <genoobie> looking at the xubuntu x-log
[07:03] <genoobie> no errors
[07:04] <well_laid_lawn> those graphics card aren't very good - here's one bug report - https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-savage/+question/195862
[07:04] <genoobie> yes, they are shit actually :)
[07:04] <well_laid_lawn> lubuntu and xubuntu use the same repos so the software handling the graphics is the same
[07:05] <genoobie> but you'd think xubuntu vs lubuntu they'd both load the stupid thing or they'd both not load it
[07:05] <genoobie> right my point
[07:05] <genoobie> so what gives...
[07:05] <genoobie> the only difference is that I used an alternate install CD for lubuntu
[07:05] <genoobie> so maybe that's what did it...
[07:07] <genoobie> I dunno, it seems like there should be enough info b/w the two sets of log files / distros to figure the shit out...
[07:08] <well_laid_lawn> what versions are the live cd and the install ?
[07:09] <well_laid_lawn> found this - http://www.phoronix.com/forums/showthread.php?70813-DRI1-drivers-for-Ubuntu-12-04-%28savage-mga-r128-tdfx-sis-unichrome%29
[07:09] <well_laid_lawn> mentions deprecation in the drivers support moving to 12.04
[07:10] <genoobie> lubuntu 12.10, xubuntu 12.04
[07:12] <well_laid_lawn> it might be easiest to just make a ~/.xinitrc and remove the dm
[07:12] <genoobie> okay
[07:12] <genoobie> I'm game
[07:12] <well_laid_lawn> since X works ok with the window manager
[07:13] <genoobie> okay, first of all, I can seem to be able to delete / write to the mounted fs
[07:13] <genoobie> any way to fix?
[07:13] <genoobie> at least that would tell me where the problem was
[07:15] <well_laid_lawn> in a terminal run   mount   and check if the partition is ro or rw
[07:15] <genoobie> well_laid_lawn, I'm sorry, what mount cmd would I use
[07:16] <genoobie> it says rw
[07:17] <well_laid_lawn> try using gksudo to edit whatever file like gksudo leafpad ~/.xinitrc
[07:17] <well_laid_lawn> !gksudo
[07:17] <ubottu> If you need to run graphical applications as root, use « gksudo », as it will set up the environment more appropriately. Never just use "sudo"! (See http://psychocats.net/ubuntu/graphicalsudo to know why)
[07:19] <genoobie> well_laid_lawn, I tried to remove the xorg.conf, would not happen
[07:19] <genoobie> oh eff
[07:20] <genoobie> ~/.xinitrc isn't going to place this in the right place
[07:20] <well_laid_lawn> you need to add the path to where it is mounted
[07:20] <well_laid_lawn> my bad... ;)
[07:20] <genoobie> but first, I still don't have permissions to write (afaik)
[07:20] <genoobie> but ok
[07:21] <genoobie> that's the home directory correct?
[07:21] <genoobie> so the full path is...
[07:22] <genoobie> is that /home/user?
[07:22] <genoobie> but the dm wants a login...
[07:22] <genoobie> urgh
[07:23] <well_laid_lawn> the mount command should show you where it is mounted
[07:24] <genoobie> yes, media/blah blah
[07:24] <genoobie> but am I making the .xinitrc in the root directory?
[07:24] <freedomrun> I have xfce-session crashed again and using 4.10 & 4.12 PPAs on Quantal, pressed "Show Details" button and waited thing to generate, now when I press "Continue" button nothing happens, can I get some help on how and where to report this??
[07:27] <genoobie> oh eff
[07:27] <genoobie> I have to do this tomorrow
[07:27] <genoobie> I have to get up for work in three hours

[12:39] <TROJAN719> hello friends
[12:39] <TROJAN719> i've got a question
[12:39] <TROJAN719> which version of xubuntu does support UEFI/EFI natively?
[12:39] <Unit193> You can easily use 12.10 64bit with UEFI.
[12:40] <TROJAN719> i tried to boot it on my laptop with UEFI mode on - it didn't boot at all
[12:40] <Unit193> Pretty easily.
[12:40] <TROJAN719> well i need x86 :)
[12:40] <Unit193> Well, none as far as I read.
[12:40] <Unit193> !uefi
[12:40] <ubottu> UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[12:41] <TROJAN719>  (32bit installer does not detect EFI)

[14:29] <xubuntu248> when i login to my account, a blue background appears but the desktop/my account itself does not
[14:29] <xubuntu248> it just sits on a blueish background and nothing loads up
[14:31] <GridCube> xubuntu248: if you have installed nautilus, uninstall it and relogin
[14:31] <xubuntu248> i don't think i have, and i can't uninstall anything, i type my password in, it accepts the password but then a blue background appears but nothing else
[14:31] <xubuntu248> a contification saying i'm connected to my wifi shows up but that's it

[14:32] <GridCube> xubuntu248: if you press alt-f2 a launcher should pop-up, type xfce4-panel
[14:33] <GridCube> or xfce4-panel --restart
[14:33] <xubuntu248> ok done that, i clicked Launch, nothing happened
[14:34] <xubuntu248> tried the restart one too, a red stop icon appeared on the left of where i typed it
[14:34] <GridCube> very weird, type xfce4-terminal to open a terminal and retype xfce4-panel there to see what it says
[14:35] <GridCube> you can launch firefox there too, to pastebin results
[14:36] <xubuntu248> not working either
[14:36] <GridCube> xfce4-panel doesnt work?
[14:36] <GridCube> xterm?
[14:37] <xubuntu248> nope... it's been happening since i went into the settings and enabled some splash screen, just to see what it was
[14:37] <xubuntu248> i get the mouse splash screen when i login
[14:37] <xubuntu248> then just a blue desktop abckground, which isn't my background
[14:37] <xubuntu248> and nothing else
[14:38] <GridCube> well, on the login stage, choose a guest user
[14:39] <xubuntu248> ok
[14:40] <xubuntu248> just a grey background when i login as a guest, with my mouse cursor, that's it
[14:40] <GridCube> not even a terminal?
[14:40] <GridCube> :/ choose an xterm session?
[14:40] <xubuntu248> no menus, just a grey background and a cursor
[14:41] <xubuntu248> there's an xfce session option? same thing happen with that though
[14:42] <xubuntu248> i'd just reinstall it but i've got some important files i need to get off my account
[14:45] <xubuntu248> ive got terminal running in an xfce sesion
[14:45] <xubuntu248> what now GridCube?
[14:46] <GridCube> ok, now run sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktopn --reinstall
[14:46] <GridCube> without that n on xubuntu-desktop
[14:48] <GridCube> im not really sure that will get rid of the broken config though, so you might want to also delete all the files on ~/.config/xfce4
[14:48] <xubuntu248> ok, waiting for it to complete now
[14:48] <GridCube> though i dont know where the change to the splash screen was made, so it might be in other place
[14:49] <xubuntu248> it's complete, some files failed to download apparently.. i'll see if it's fixed
[14:51] <xubuntu248> ok i think i've got it sorted out now
[14:51] <xubuntu248> thanks a lot for that Grid
[14:51] <GridCube> :) good luck

[18:05] <entreri> well_laid_lawn: dd seems to work, thanks
[18:06] <well_laid_lawn> cheers
[18:09] <David-A> entreri: the reason sudo ... >/dev/blabla does not work is the redirect (>) occurs before sudo, that is as your normal user that has no write access to raw devices.

[18:14] <CajunTechie> Hi everyone. Any way to find out why my xubuntu suddenly freezes and needs a hard reboot? Which logs would I look in?
[18:17] <well_laid_lawn> CajunTechie:  most times a freeze stops logs from being written to but try the Xorg log and kernel log in /var/log
[18:19] <CajunTechie> Thanks well_laid_lawn. I'll take a look. I don't think it's a full freeze. Streaming music keeps going but nothing responds/
[18:20] <well_laid_lawn> CajunTechie:  can you change to a tty with Ctrl+Alt+F2 when it happens?
[18:20] <CajunTechie> Sometimes. Most times, no.

[18:46] <Petros> Hello. I just ahad power cut and now, when I log into my profile, after a while the system say something like "nfs core dump" and restarts to the login screen. Now I am working on the guest profile. Any hint how to deal with it?
[18:50] <user> hi guys
[18:51] <user> having issues with my nokia booklet 3g notebook
[18:51] <holstein> user: with the 3g internet?
[18:52] <user> no, with waking after sleep
[18:52] <user> every time i wake it the screen goes to green and i have to restart
[18:53] <user> currently running xubuntu
[18:53] <holstein> user: i would try different graphics drivers, and see if you find someone with that *exact* issue
[18:53] <holstein> i might try and see if i could pull the hard drive out and test with a live CD or USB
[18:54] <holstein> then, i could force restarts without worrying about the drive, though testing different graphics drivers might be more challenging
[18:54] <holstein> you could test with "nomodeset" though, and get an idea
[18:55] <David-A> Petros: you have network storage or something set up for you normal user? if you could find the dot-file containing its config and remove it (not remove, but move out of the way) and reconfigure it.
[18:56] <holstein> Petros: yeah, i agree with David-A ...if the issue is fine as another user, then the issue is in the /home directory somewhere
[18:57] <user> i know that nokia notebook ubuntu users had some sort of issues with gma500 graphic drivers, but that was like year 2010
[18:57] <holstein> user: i dont think that has changed much.. the support
[18:57] <holstein> user: i had an issue like that and i choose not to sleep the machine
[18:58] <Petros> user, David-A - can I access (not encrypted) home dir from the guest profile?
[18:58] <user> so whats the alternative for sleep then?
[18:59] <holstein> Petros: you should be able to login from the recover console, or commandline
[19:00] <David-A> Petros: guest can not change other users files, but can normally read them. (except those it can't)
[19:00] <holstein> Petros: with FOSS, the answer is almost always "yes"... but knowing how can be tricky
[19:00] <entreri> David-A: that's right, but after that I loged in as root and did it, did not do anything : P
[19:01] <entreri> but yeah the command I wrote as an exemple was not accurate to the symptom "doesn't do anything"
[19:02] <David-A> Petros: did what as root? what dot-file did you move away? (I cannot tell what dot-file it should be, but maybe someone elses bell rings)
[19:03] <holstein> i usually just move them all, and test.. and then put things back as needed
[19:03] <user> alternatives to sleep?
[19:03] <Petros> Guys, thank you for pointing the direction - I am beginning the long evening with xubuntu :-)
[19:03] <holstein> user: shutting down
[19:03] <knome> it's safe to remove at least ~/.cache
[19:04] <knome> and it's usually a good idea to do "mv -R ~/.config ~/.config.backup before trying things out
[19:04] <knome> and just try to login after doing that (since all the config should be reset)
[19:10] <holstein> yup... i like to just move the whole thing, and try it, just to be sure i can login and that was the issue
[20:09] <jonny|> Hi guys, quick question: I just installed Xubuntu and it automatically mounted my Windows drive. When I try to unmount it, it says 'one or more applications are keeping this volume busy' - am I right that nothing bad will happen to my windows partition if I force the unmount?
[20:10] <holstein> jonny|: if you are worried, you can shutdown,.. it really depends on what is keeping what busy, and why/how
[20:11] <jonny|> holstein: It looks like there should be a box saying which application is using the partition, but there isn't anything in it.
[20:11] <holstein> jonny|: could just the the filemanager
[20:12] <holstein> jonny|: i would have my data backedup.. i would mount it with a live CD if i were worried.. i would shutdown if i were concerned that the force unmout would break something
[20:12] <jonny|> holstein: Thanks for your help :)
[22:23] <Muzz> Is it possible to have cpu and memory usage displayed in a panel as text?
[22:35] <David-A> Muzz: there is a "generic monitor" that shows the output text of any command. make a script that outputs numbers or short text for cpu and memory usage.
[22:36] <Muzz> Thanks, I'll try that.

[23:12] <zoom> im having trouble with a laptop that refuses to enter any sort of power saving mode
[23:12] <zoom> it simply blanks the screen and comes back to the desktop after a few seconds
[23:13] <zoom> and sadly the very limited acer bios has 0.0 options to change stuff
[23:14] <zoom> foudn several posts with people having trouble with usb controllers (specifically usb , which i dont have)
[23:16] <knome> zoom, have you googled for your laptop model if somebody else has gotten things to work?
[23:16] <zoom> sadly i havent turned up much
[23:17] <knome> right, the next question is - can you update your bios?
[23:18] <knome> i mean 1) is there updates available 2) do you have a method you can use 3) are you willing to
[23:19] <zoom> the will and abillity are there
[23:20] <zoom> lets see if they updated something
[23:20] <zoom> by the way i checked against a ubuntu lts live cd and got the same behavior
[23:20] <knome> that's bad
[23:20] <knome> but a bios update can help a lot
[23:20] <knome> did with my wife's older hp, suddenly many many things started working
[23:20] <zoom> but since #ubuntu is having several conversations at once I came here
[23:21] <knome> not so sure how open acer are going, but...
[23:21] <zoom> other than the sleeping ive been rather happy
[23:21] <knome> well, since this isn't de-specific, feel free to ask here too (though you'd have more possibilities of getting help in #ubuntu even if it is a bit more traffic there)
[23:21] <zoom> was delighted to see the full disk encryption on the normal cd (have had ubuntu as "fix windows" dual boots and i use it at work to develop")
[23:23] <zoom> aww, too bad
[23:23] <zoom> acer has 3.04, my bios is alread 2.04
=== hns is now known as Guest38049
[23:25] <zoom> the powermanager makes a seperate pm_suspend.log, but i havent found out what kills it
[23:25] <zoom> i could clear it and pastebin you a copy of exactly one suspend attempt
[23:35] <zoom> the only thing the bios lets me choose is wether or not i want a serial, IR and parralel port... and the time
[23:36] <zoom> pastebin.com/RQesRUw3 for the pm-suspend and pm-powersave.log , if that would help anyone
[23:39] <knome> sorry, i'm pretty clueless
[23:42] <zoom> ill try a xubuntu 12.04 32bit live cd (the others were 64), if that behaves the same i guess ill have to attack a forum with it
[23:42] <zoom> the bug that is
[23:43] <zoom> 'problem'
[23:43] <zoom> or "potential" as our agile coach would call it
[23:43] <knome> agile... :)
[23:43] <zoom> running faster than others when the mob comes knocking on the door?
[23:45] <knome> probably not...
[23:50] <xubuntu064> hello
[23:50] <knome> hello
[23:51] <xubuntu064> can i have cairo dock in this distro?
[23:51] <knome> that should work, but there's no guarantee how well it will work
[23:51] <xubuntu064> ok,
