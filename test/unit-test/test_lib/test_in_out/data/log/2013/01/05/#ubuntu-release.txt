[07:46] <infinity> slangasek: So, if the current quantal SRU is proven to fix the samsung bricking issue, should we respin ubuntu/quantal/amd64 with no updates except the kernel?
[07:47] <infinity> slangasek: Normally not something I'd suggest, but I think cutting down on killing machines might be nice.
[07:47] <infinity> slangasek: (If Samsung needs images to test, I can spin one over the weekend)
