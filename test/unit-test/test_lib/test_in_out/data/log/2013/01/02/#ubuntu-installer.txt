[09:51] <brendand> is it a known issue that ubiquity won't accept a password for WEP networks in the network selection screen?
[09:51] <brendand> i've just seen this on the nexus7
[09:53] <xnox> brendand: i can't remember exactly which wifi networks, but indeed ubiquity under-asks wifi passwords for some networks. There was a bug about it & design solution (ask NM to connect & wait for NM popups to configure network)
[09:53] <xnox> brendand: as a workaround, one can use network indicator.
[09:57] <brendand> xnox, ah indeed
[09:57] <brendand> xnox, thanks
[09:57] <xnox> np
[11:21] <gema> xnox: happy new year
[11:21]  * gema guesses he knows what's coming after that
[11:22] <xnox> gema: happy new year =)
[11:22] <gema> :D
[11:22] <gema> xnox: bug 1080701 seems to be affecting many people and seems to be slowing down the manual testing efforts
[11:22] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1080701 in ubiquity (Ubuntu Raring) "After 'Preparing to install Ubuntu' screen, raring installation hangs" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1080701
[11:22] <gema> any chance you could have a look at it soonish?
[11:22] <xnox> right. on it then.
[11:23] <gema> thanks!
[11:24] <gema> xnox: psivaa should be able to help you reproduce
[13:03] <psivaa> mr -> lunch
[13:04]  * psivaa -> lunch
[13:55] <xnox> gema: psivaa: I am failing to reproduce the problem. Sure, it takes longer for partitioning screen to appear with increased amount of partitions (e.g. 4-6 minutes with my 15 lvm volumes) but it does appear eventually.
[13:55]  * xnox will upload some fixes that speed this step up, but i am not convinced it's a real fix for what is experienced here.
[13:56] <gema> xnox: psivaa will help you reproduce as soon as he is back , I also pinged him
[14:02] <psivaa> xnox: i'm trying this now, but did you try with i386 image on the hardware? (with possibly windows 7 already installed)
[14:05] <xnox> psivaa: not i386 image, not with windows7. I am uploading a fix that will skip ntfs partitions when trying to detect ubuntu installations. (this should reduce the delay).
[14:08] <psivaa> xnox: ahh ok, that could be the reason why you are not able to reproduce, iirc, with i386 on a machine with windows 7 this was a hang that never timedout even after more than half an hour
[14:09] <xnox> psivaa: interesting. How much disk space does windows 7 need? /me might be able to reproduce it.
[14:15] <psivaa> xnox: i think 20G should be enough for w7 installation, i have a machine that already has it. iirc you were able to reproduce this on the 10th dec :)
[14:16] <xnox> psivaa: well, not reliably, and it turned out kvm saw input/output errors on the disk & hence hang the install.
[14:17] <xnox> psivaa: I have windows7 cd, fetching i386 iso now as well.
[14:34] <psivaa> xnox: thanks, with windows 7 and i386 my installation is still hung past 10 mins
[14:34] <xnox> ack. thanks.
[14:35]  * xnox is slowly installing windows 7 in the background.

[17:59] <antarus> this announcement better be super awesome
[18:14] <gema> xnox: still around?
[18:14] <gema> xnox: how's that bug going? it is also hitting us on bootspeed testing :(
