[00:20] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 1101213 in gnome-control-center (Ubuntu) "G-c-c printing doesn't allow you to select a hp printer" [Undecided,Triaged]
[00:23] <cprofitt> just found the same situation for my priter as well. Simple work around, but not something I would want to get to release
[01:38] <agrestringere> Can I get someones opinion on a bug I'm currently managing? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/1015297
[01:38] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 1015297 in Xubuntu "Screen partially darkened after suspend and resume in Xubuntu" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[01:38]  * TheLordOfTime yawns and looks in
[01:38] <TheLordOfTime> what's your question?
[01:39]  * TheLordOfTime sees its marked as "Opinion", where it may just need package reassignment.
[01:40] <agrestringere> I've confirmed that Xscreensaver is the probable source of the bug due to the variability in graphics drivers and all users are reporting from Xubuntu...
[01:40] <TheLordOfTime> right, i can see that in your messages :)
[01:40] <agrestringere> Should I just reassign this to Xscreensaver and Xubuntu alone and leave the graphics package FGLRX out of it?
[01:41] <TheLordOfTime> firstly, i'm not sure why the "Opinion" status is used here...
[01:42] <TheLordOfTime> secondly is it really a bug in fglrx-installer?
[01:42] <TheLordOfTime> if it's not a bug in fglrx-installer at all, then it shouldn't be assigned against FGLRX
[01:42] <TheLordOfTime> at least, according to normal triage guides
[01:42] <TheLordOfTime> guidelines *
[01:42] <TheLordOfTime> but i'm not a drivers person, i only follow the triage guide *checks to see if fglrx/xscreensaver have different guidelines*
[01:43] <TheLordOfTime> well i know X has its own triage guidelines... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Triaging
[01:44] <TheLordOfTime> agrestringere, is it really a bug in the driver?
[01:44] <TheLordOfTime> s/the driver/fglrx/
[01:44] <TheLordOfTime> or is it really a bug in xscreensaver
[01:45] <agrestringere> It seems to be Xubuntu related because all the reporters have different video hardware, some Nvidia others ATI/AMD, etc...right?
[01:45]  * TheLordOfTime would defer to an Xubuntu dev for that
[01:45] <TheLordOfTime> and you said its xubuntu right?
[01:45] <agrestringere> Yes
[01:51] <TheLordOfTime> agrestringere, mind explaining the reasoning for the "Opinion" status on that bug?
[01:52] <TheLordOfTime> (I rarely see bugs marked as opinion, so...)
[01:54] <agrestringere> Because it may or may not be due to the package the reporter originally reported against and it's highly improbable therefore opinion...
[01:56]  * TheLordOfTime shrugs
[01:56] <TheLordOfTime> usually things don't end up as opinion unless the package maintainer sets that, so... *shrug*
[01:56] <TheLordOfTime> not that it matters, at least not for me
[01:56]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[01:56] <TheLordOfTime> ... coffee refill time.
[01:59] <agrestringere> Okay, I'll just wait for the developers to take a look...
[01:59] <TheLordOfTime> or at least wait for their advice on triage procedure.
[02:00] <TheLordOfTime> i'm pretty certain standard triage applies, but... i'm tired so......... :P
[02:02] <agrestringere> Coffee can only do so much...
[02:02]  * TheLordOfTime sips the cup of coffee
[04:02] <agrestringere> micahg, so you think I should include all relevant graphics packages?
[04:02] <agrestringere> sorry wrong channel
