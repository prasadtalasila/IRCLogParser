[03:21] <Omen__20> So I'm confused, why does there seem to be two strategies between Phone using Qt and Quickly on desktop using Gtk?
[03:24] <xsacha> i guess they finally realised Qt is better for making cross-form factor UIs
[03:24] <xsacha> and it already has the kitchen sink in there for mobile devices
[03:25] <xsacha> everything runs on the GPU (GLES2), easy to use shaders, has all the mobility components like sensors
[03:25] <Omen__20> So Quickly was more or less a waste of time?
[03:27] <xsacha> i'm not familiar with Quickly
[03:30] <Omen__20> This is what I was going on. http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/ I was confused because I had heard phone was using Qt. I figured they were going all in on Qt and apps would scale their UI based on the device.
[03:31] <xsacha> it would make sense to use same toolkit
[03:31] <xsacha> cool, gtk looks like old-style Qt
[03:31] <xsacha> forms
[03:32] <xsacha> and PyQt
[03:33] <xsacha> i hadn't heard of Quickly before but it looks like what Qt was from years back
[03:33] <xsacha> forms weren't good for cross-form factor and the files weren't nice to read (not sure if gtk is different here)
[03:34] <xsacha> but Qt now uses 'QtQuick' for these UIs, based on javascript
[03:35] <xsacha> i am not sure if ubuntu plans to continue using gtk for desktop. it is possible

[08:15] <maniyadv> hi.. how do i register for ubuntu.mybalsamiq.com
[08:20] <maniyadv> I'm not able to see mockups
[08:34] <Andy80> 'morning
[08:34] <Andy80> bzoltan1, ping :)
[08:35] <bzoltan1> Andy80: hello
[08:35] <Andy80> bzoltan1, 'morning :)
[08:35] <Andy80> bzoltan1, to build a house we start from the first stone, right? well... https://launchpad.net/qtcreator-ubuntu let's see how it goes :)
[08:37] <bzoltan1>  Andy80:  the source lives here -> http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator I assume you have figured that much out :)
[08:37] <bzoltan1> and we have built for Qt5 beta1 one package here -> https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers/+archive/qt5-beta1/+packages
[08:38] <Andy80> bzoltan1, at the beginning I wanted to use GitHub, but I created a project on LP hoping to involve more people. Until the plugin is not ready and working I don't think anyone from Digia would want to have my sources inside their repository :P
[08:39] <Andy80> yeah, I know about Qt5 beta1 packages
[08:39] <bzoltan1> Andy80: As you wish
[08:40] <Andy80> but again, it's not something strictly linked to Qt5. It requires Qt 4.8.x to run
[08:41] <Andy80> bzoltan1, now the most difficoult part: I've to figure out how the actual plugins work because lot of things are not documented at all
[08:42] <bzoltan1> Andy80:   That is why you want to talk to jppiiroinen who is going to be here soon :)
[08:42] <Andy80> bzoltan1, I asked a couple of questions to the guy who did the Android Necessitas plugin and he confirmed he had to just read the sources of other similar plugins to be able to write his
[08:42] <bzoltan1> Andy80:  keep in mind that we have hardly anything to do with Qt4.8 ...
[08:42] <Andy80> yeah I sent him a contact request on LinkedIn :) I hope he will reply soon :)
[08:43] <Andy80> bzoltan1, not true :) a person could run Qt 4.8 on his development machine and be able to write/compile/run Qt5 app on a remote device
[08:44] <bzoltan1> Andy80:  There is no Quick2 in Qt4.8 and our app development is QML2 based
[08:45] <bzoltan1> Andy80: So, there is very little overlap ... if any
[08:45] <Andy80> yeah I know, but no plugin requires Qt5 to compile and run, that's what I'm trying to say
[08:45] <bzoltan1> And here comes juhapekka!
[08:45] <jppiiroinen> o/
[08:45] <Andy80> hi juhapekka! :)
[08:45] <jppiiroinen> hi Andy80, what's up :)
[08:46] <Andy80> moi moi :)
[08:46] <bzoltan1> Andy80: ,meeet  jppiiroinen, the father of the N9 app developer IDE plugins :)
[08:46] <Andy80> nice to meet you! :)
[08:47] <jppiiroinen> :D
[08:47] <jppiiroinen> i just got a flashback from star wars.. "I am your father"
[08:48] <Andy80> maybe not my father, but surely one of my myths :D (N9 people :P )
[08:48] <jppiiroinen> :,D
[08:51] <Andy80> well, going back to the development... as I was just announcing to Zoltan, I've opened a project here https://launchpad.net/qtcreator-ubuntu why a project? To hope to involve more people in the development. I've one question: do you confirm me that, apart from this http://doc.qt.digia.com/qtcreator-extending/first-plugin.html there is not so much documentation about this? I talked with the guy who wrote Android Necessitas plugin and he told me
[08:51] <Andy80> he had to look at source code of similar plugins to be able to write his.
[08:51] <astraljava> Heh, cool to see familiar names from the Maemo/MeeGo circles.
[08:55] <jppiiroinen> Andy80: yeah there is not much of written documentation, which means that the easiest route is to go thru the existing plugins and see how those have been written and then pick up the right interfaces
[08:56] <faizan> sudo apt-get install
[08:56]  * jppiiroinen command not found
[08:56] <faizan> download
[08:57] <jppiiroinen> Andy80: the point where to start is the Madde plugin, imo
[08:58] <jppiiroinen> at least that utilities similar things and it has the Linux Device target selection etc
[08:58] <faizan> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-nexus7/ubuntu-nexus7-installer
[08:58] <Andy80> jppiiroinen, this one http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/qt-creator/trees/master/src/plugins/madde right?
[08:59] <jppiiroinen> Andy80: yes, and that uses the http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/qt-creator/trees/master/src/plugins/remotelinux which is the same which we should use
[08:59] <Andy80> jppiiroinen, yeah, I wasn't going to re-invent the wheel, don't worry, but I'd like to be able at least to pick up all the needed pieces and compose the new plugin with the minimum necessary
[08:59] <jppiiroinen> :)
[09:00] <jppiiroinen> i will search the codebase for the application wizard too
[09:01] <faizan> i want to download img of ubuntu phone
[09:01] <Andy80> jppiiroinen, I think we will have to customize also the wizard class of the plugin, because at the moment a QtQuick UI application (pure QML and JS) cannot be deployed with Generic Linux Device, it deploys only to desktop target
[09:05] <jppiiroinen> Andy80: true, i have not had time to check the latest qt creator source tree what they have changed, but i can see that they have added at least support for Qt5 and added a pile of new application templates
[09:06] <jppiiroinen> Andy80: the application templates are here http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator/qt-creator/trees/master/share/qtcreator/templates
[09:06] <Andy80> jppiiroinen, in the "master" they have move many wizards to the templates folder. Before they were integrated in the basic wizard plugin.
[09:08] <Andy80> jppiiroinen, yes, I was able to create a new template, but then I found that limitation I was talking about before (QML app not deployable on remote device)
[09:08] <Andy80> for this reason I decided to start a new plugin
[09:12] <jppiiroinen> Andy80: i will take a look later today on some notes which i have and i could do a merge request to lp:qtcreator-ubuntu
[09:13] <jppiiroinen> and we could then go more into details when i have looked inside the latest qt creator source tree
[09:13] <Andy80> jppiiroinen, that would be great! Please consider that the current code is just the "hello world" of plugins. I committed the code to have a starting point and to manage the code with bzr from the beginning :)
[09:15] <jppiiroinen> yeah :)
[09:18] <Andy80> bzoltan1, I just had a flash back! Please correct me if I'm wrong.... you remember the 20 minutes presentation vide where Mark talks about Ubuntu Phone? At one point you see QtCreator in action with a UI designer... is that just a mockup? (if you can answer of course)
[09:19] <bzoltan1> Andy80: to be hones, I do not remember that part of the video
[09:20] <Andy80> bzoltan1.Add(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpWHJDLsqTU); bzoltan1.Seek(17:20); bzoltan1.Memory.Refresh(); :D
[09:21] <Andy80> watching it again it looks like the basic UI designer
[09:22] <Andy80> nothing Ubuntu customized..
[09:22] <Andy80> (there aren't any Ubuntu QML components)
[09:23] <bzoltan1> Andy80:  that was a real and _vanilla_ QtCreator
[09:24] <Andy80> ah ok, so it was just a dejavu :)

[14:09] <sivang> kalikiana: really like how everything is easily installabled off the PPAs
[14:09] <kalikiana> cool
[14:10] <kalikiana> the cherry one the cake for me would be if you didn't need to type the PPA commands, but I'm being lazy :-D
[14:11] <sivang> kalikiana: Ubuntu is not really ubuntu for me without the sudo apt-get's ;)
[14:12] <kalikiana> hehe
[14:12] <kalikiana> I have not so fond memories of Windows development, I would've killed for apt-get back then
[14:15] <sivang> kalikiana: yep, luckily I did not have to deal with Windows dev since 2002
