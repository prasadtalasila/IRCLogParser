[03:46] <dajhorn> Where can I get the current source code for the mountall package in precise-updates at Launchpad?  `bzr branch lp:ubuntu/precise/mountall` returns an old version.  (Got 2.36 expected 2.36.3)
[03:50] <wgrant> dajhorn: It looks like the bzr import of the mountall package has been suspended due to bug #714622 (someone overwrite the branch). But you can always download the latest source package by expanding the relevant row on https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mountall
[03:50] <ubot5> bug 714622 in Ubuntu Distributed Development "import fails when lp branch has been push --overwrite'n" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/714622
[03:53] <micahg> dajhorn: pull-lp-source mountall precise-updates (needs ubuntu-dev-tools installed)
[03:59] <dajhorn> wgrant, is this repository corruption? Should I put a meetoo on that ticket?
[03:59] <dajhorn> micahg, that got the expected version.
[04:01] <wgrant> dajhorn: Not corruption as such, just someone doing something wrong
[04:21] <dajhorn> Thanks for the help. I opened a new ticket for mountall and blurbed it at 714622.
[05:15] <dajhorn> wgrant, my bug report was invalidated by Steve Langasek. (Bug 1103319)
[05:15] <ubot5> bug 1103319 in mountall (Ubuntu) "mountall source code repository is stale" [Undecided,Invalid] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1103319
[05:15] <dajhorn> Any other ideas on where to get this Ubuntu source code repository?
[05:17] <wgrant> dajhorn: micahg and I each gave you an another way to get it.
[05:17] <wgrant> Just not in bzr form (because a bzr branch of the latest version does not exist)
[05:17] <dajhorn> wgrant, I actually need the repo history, not the raw source code.
[05:17] <dajhorn> ie: To maintain a separate branch.
[05:17] <wgrant> There is no repo to have history.
[05:18] <wgrant> So that's a bit difficult.
[05:18] <wgrant> What you request simply does not exist.
[05:18] <wgrant> Why do you need it?
[05:18] <dajhorn> wgrant, I'm maintaining a branch of mountall that has ZFS support.
[05:20] <wgrant> dajhorn: Well, you might have to merge in the 2.36.3 changes yourself
[05:20] <dajhorn> wgrant, okay, thanks.  I never suspected that Ubuntu doesn't keep everything in source control.
[05:20] <wgrant> The mountall branches on Launchpad are not imported, and haven't obviously been updated with the 2.36.3 changes.
[05:21] <wgrant> dajhorn: The uploaded source packages are themselves a form of source control
[05:21] <wgrant> But not everything is in bzr
[08:42] <tsdgeos> Hi guys, trying to do a branch "Resubmit proposal to merge" and getting timeouts all the time
[08:42] <tsdgeos> known issue?
[09:51] <xnox> dajhorn: hmm... why don't you submit a patch for zfs support in mountall?
[09:52] <xnox> dajhorn: it's interesting to upstream because debian has zfs support =)
[10:10] <ricotz> hello :), it seems only one armhf ppa builder is actually accepting builds, is this intended?
[10:17] <czajkowski> wgrant: builders ok?
[10:18] <wgrant> Various qemu bugs keep taking out the ARM virtual builders.
[10:18] <wgrant> I'll get them restarted
[10:19] <lifeless> wgrant: cron it ? :)
[10:20] <wgrant> That would make the long-running builds somewhat unhappy
[10:20] <lifeless> wgrant: Twas a joke.
[10:20] <wgrant> Yes, but it's scarily close to relaity :)
[10:21] <czajkowski> it's funny cause it's true
[10:21] <czajkowski> it's gonna be one of them weeks :(
[10:21] <ricotz> oh, i see :\, thanks for taking care

[11:39] <ricotz> wgrant, hi, do you mind taking a look at those rogue builds https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+build/4240273  https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+build/3742041
[11:39] <czajkowski> do you want them restarted ?
[11:49] <ricotz> czajkowski, they are not accessible, just an OOPS
[11:50] <czajkowski> ah  not seen one of them before. LocationError: (None, 'builder')
[11:51] <czajkowski> perhaps after they kicked those machines
[11:57] <ricotz> could be, would be nice to clear those
[11:58] <czajkowski> ok give me a few in the middle of stuff now
[11:58] <czajkowski> also wasnt this the first project to get arm builds, still staying below the 10 builds a week ?
[11:58] <czajkowski> seems to be alot of issues usually with this builds
[12:12] <czajkowski> ricotz: so would you like them restarted?
[12:13] <ricotz> czajkowski, please restart https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+build/4240273
[12:13] <ricotz> and just remove https://launchpad.net/~elementary-os/+archive/daily/+build/3742041
[12:13] <ricotz> czajkowski, yes, you said it was the first probject
[12:14] <ricotz> czajkowski, hmm, restriction of 10 builds a weeks, this seems to be quite more
[12:14] <ricotz> czajkowski, you mean 10 builds for the whole ppa?
[12:15] <czajkowski> ricotz: yes in order to have the arm builds we did set some limits.
[12:15] <ricotz> or per package?
[12:16] <czajkowski> https://dev.launchpad.net/CommunityARMBuilds
[12:18] <ricotz> i see, the builds are way less then 4 hours, but i assume there are like 120 builds per week
[12:18] <czajkowski> we did advertise these guildelines
[12:19] <czajkowski> as for those builds, they are currently oopsing
[12:19] <czajkowski> and I'll need to wait till wgrant or StevenK come online later today
[12:20] <ricotz> czajkowski, sorry, the guidelnes were set after it was enabled and it is a daily ppa :\
[12:20] <czajkowski> guidelines were set before we annouced the availability
[12:21] <ricotz> i know, but you enabled them even before that, anyhow so we need to reduce the amount significantly?
[12:22] <czajkowski> no I enabled them on the day :)
[12:22] <ricotz> ok, ok :)

[15:05] <oly> hi, wonder if anyone may be able to tell me the cause of this, i am trying to create a package for a C program how ever the resulting deb does not contain any files its liek it never actually build / configures the code
[15:05] <oly> the packaging files are located here, http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~oly/+junk/geanypy-packaging/files
[15:06] <oly> and the source is here, i am using a recipe but also tried locally http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~oly/geanypy/geanypy/files
[15:06] <oly> i normally package files that dont need compiling so its partially new territory and this is the result of following a tutorial.
[15:19] <Laney> oly: I suggest you try #ubuntu-packaging; this isn't really the right place for questions about that
[15:31] <oly> cheers Laney, was not aware of that room :)

[16:56] <exarkun> Can I remove a project from a project group?
[16:57] <czajkowski> not done that before
[16:57] <czajkowski> let me know
[16:57] <czajkowski> what i the project group and project
[16:57] <mgz> exarkun: yes, if you're an admin of the project
[16:58] <exarkun> mgz: Maybe I'm not?  I can't see any UI for doing so.  Where do I look?
[16:58] <mgz> go to "Change details" (+edit) and remove the "Part of..." text
[16:58] <exarkun> I would like to remove https://launchpad.net/pyflakes from its group.
[16:58] <exarkun> Oh :(  I think I did things in the wrong order.
[16:59] <exarkun> I already changed the maintainer for a group I am part of to a different person.  So I can't "Change details" any more, I think?
[16:59] <mgz> right :)
[16:59] <mgz> czajkowski has super-powers though, so can probably do it for you
[16:59] <exarkun> s/for/from/
[17:00] <mgz> or you can ask the newly assigned maintainer to do it.
[17:01] <czajkowski> aye as I currently can';t :/

[19:16] <kdub> if i upload a package to launchpad, does launchpad go and  build that package, or should it appear immediately
[19:55] <joey> dzin: oh you know what, I bet the LP guys are sprinting this week
[19:55] <czajkowski> joey: what's up
[19:55] <czajkowski> can I help
[19:55] <czajkowski> or else wait for mainteance to come online from AU
[19:55] <joey> czajkowski: ah good I was just going to poke you :-)
[19:55] <dzin> czajkowski: actually I have an issue
[19:56] <joey> czajkowski: dzin is here from Linaro and has an issue I can't explain
[19:56] <czajkowski> well try adn explain to me and if not we can wait till StevenK or wgrant come online in a few hours
[19:56] <dzin> czajkowski:  no bugs displayed here (trunk series) https://bugs.launchpad.net/linaro-big-little-system/trunk
[19:57] <dzin> czajkowski:  yet bugs displayed here: https://launchpad.net/linaro-big-little-system/+milestone/13.01
[19:57] <joey> czajkowski: if you check the default search parms it should show those. They aren't private, they are new/confirmed
[19:57] <czajkowski> why are you doing it to /trunk
[19:58] <dzin> czajkowski: joey: actually one is private
[19:58] <czajkowski> daft question but seeing as I'm not sure it's a good place to ask as a ny
[19:58] <czajkowski> https://bugs.launchpad.net/linaro-big-little-system/  I can see them there
[19:58] <czajkowski> so wondering why /trunk
[19:58] <joey> dzin: oh I see 2 public and no private (but I don't have Linaro powers any longer so that might be why)
[19:58] <dzin> czajkowski: I click on the trunk series then on bugs
[19:59] <czajkowski> not seen people do it that way before
[19:59] <czajkowski> :/
[19:59] <dzin> joey: quite right, there are 3 bugs total
[19:59] <joey> yeah the series is trunk apparently as seen in https://launchpad.net/linaro-big-little-system/+milestone/13.01
[19:59] <dzin> czajkowski: I've always been a bit different
[19:59] <czajkowski> I clicked on https://bugs.launchpad.net/linaro-big-little-system/  then on the milestones on the page
[19:59] <joey> right but the bug section below is blank
[19:59] <czajkowski> Milestone-targeted bugs
[20:00] <joey> and all bugs takes you to https://bugs.launchpad.net/linaro-big-little-system/trunk
[20:00] <joey> which is also blank
[20:00] <czajkowski> I've not seen this before at all
[20:00] <czajkowski> um...
[20:01] <czajkowski> we're going to have to wait till AU comealone as they will probably know straight off
[20:01] <joey> that was my reaction :-)
[20:01] <czajkowski> sorry
[20:01] <dzin> czajkowski: I've just recently changed some details on the project
[20:01] <czajkowski> dzin: for future though filing a question on LP gets our attention
[20:01] <czajkowski> dzin: ahhhhhhhhhh
[20:02] <czajkowski> dzin: what have you done in /+sharing
[20:02] <czajkowski> re bugs
[20:02] <dzin> czajkowski: right
[20:04] <joey> dzin: make sure it's shared with the right teams (hat tip czajkowski)
[20:04] <Munchor> Hey there guys, I'm using launchpadlib, is it ok to ask a question here, or is there another channel more launchpadlib-specific?
[20:05] <dzin> joey: czajkowski: I've changed bugs to public
[20:05] <czajkowski> Munchor: if it's dev inclined you will be better off mailing launchpad-dev at this hour of the day tbh
[20:09] <dzin> joey: czajkowski: sorry, not sure I get where to share. The sharing policies are: branches: Forbidden, bugs: Public, blueprints: Public.
[20:10] <joey> dzin: I *think* you need to ensure that your teams have project grants
[20:10] <dzin> joey: if I'm the admin here, why can't I see the bugs?
[20:11] <Munchor> alright czajkowski
[20:11] <joey> dzin: darn good question. I would think you should be able to do so
[20:13] <joey> dzin: if you can hang on until wgrant wakes up, he might know the answer to this boggle
[20:14] <dzin> joey: sure thing, thanks
[20:15] <dajhorn> xnox, we might have a Debian sponsor, and the plan is to get it integrated there first, and ensure that it fits with the existing kFreeBSD support.  PPAs are better for vibrant packages than the universe section.
[20:15] <czajkowski> joey: dzin have you read http://blog.launchpad.net/general/information-sharing-is-now-in-beta-for-everyone
[20:20] <dzin> czajkowski: yes, I've seen that, thanks
[20:22] <dobey> what's the problem?
[20:25] <dobey> dzin: bugs.lp.net/project/series only shows bugs filed in that project, and which are targeted to that series. if a branch hasn't been specifically targeted to trunk, it won't show up on the list for /trunk.
[20:25] <dobey> dzin: you're not seeing any bugs there, because no bugs have trunk as a target :)
[20:30] <dzin> dobey: how do I target a bug to a series?
[20:32] <dobey> dzin: make sure the project you want to target for is in the URL of the bug you're viewing, and click the "Target to series" underneath the bug info box
[20:33] <dobey> dzin: it can be confusing if a bug has tasks for multiple projects on it
[20:33] <dzin> dobey: ah, I see it.
[20:33] <dobey> but the project will be in the URL and the project name at the top of the page
[20:35] <dzin> dobey: perfect, I see the logic of it now. Thanks.
[20:36] <dobey> sure
