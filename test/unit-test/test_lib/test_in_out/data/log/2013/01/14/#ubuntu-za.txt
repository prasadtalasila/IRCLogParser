[06:16] <digigram> hi Kilos 
[06:37] <superfly> hi digigram
[06:38] <digigram> hey superfly 
[06:38] <superfly> so, anyone else interested in joining Ubuntu-MX and Ubuntu-CO with LocoGames?
[06:38] <superfly> they're starting at 17:00 on the 9th of Feb
[06:41] <barrydk> Morning superfly
[06:41] <barrydk> Is this online gaming?
[06:42] <superfly> yup
[06:42] <barrydk> Wish i also had cheap data
[06:48] <superfly> Apparently I can get 40Mbps in my area, when Telkom launches it in MArch
[06:49] <theblazehen> superfly:  Thats really nice. also hi
[06:49] <barrydk> Talk about something else youre making me grumpy nou.
[06:49] <superfly> hi theblazehen
[06:49] <magespawn_> mornign all
=== magespawn_ is now known as magespawn
[06:50] <theblazehen> barrydk: how much do you get ?
[06:50] <barrydk> Morning morning
[06:50] <magespawn> morning all
[06:50] <theblazehen> hi all
[06:50] <superfly> barrydk: I can't afford it now, but maybe in a year I'll upgrade
[06:50] <superfly> heya magespawn!
[06:50] <magespawn> thats fast superfly
[06:51] <magespawn> on my exchange they do not support the 10Mbps yet
[06:51] <superfly> I have 10Mbps (supposedly)
[06:52] <barrydk> I pay 540 for 1Gb. It is the best in my area, no telkom and Mtn is only edge, 
[06:52] <magespawn> yeah love the way they do that
[06:52] <theblazehen> that sucks
[06:55] <magespawn> that is hectic barrydk
[06:56] <magespawn> barrydk: where are you?
[06:57] <magespawn> superfly what games are they running at LocoGames?
[06:57] <jrgns> morning all
[06:57] <superfly> magespawn: AssaultCube, UrbanTerror and Battle for Wesnoth
[06:58] <Kilos> hi jrgns 
[06:58] <superfly> AssaultCube and UrbanTerror are Counter Strike alternatives
[06:58] <magespawn> have not tried the first two but i do play the last one
[06:59] <magespawn> where can we get more info?
[06:59] <superfly> http://viajemotu.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/ubuntu-loco-games-2013-1/
[06:59] <barrydk> magespawn, i am just outside Cullinan on a farm.
[07:00] <magespawn> middle of no where
[07:01] <barrydk> no man 50 k from Pretoria
[07:02] <magespawn> that for telkom qualifies as the middle of no where
[07:02] <Kilos> haha
[07:02] <barrydk> yup
[07:06] <superfly> Muizenberg in Cape Town qualifies as the middle of nowhere for Telkom, so barrydk is indeed worse off than most of us
[07:06] <digigram> mmm I know
[07:07] <digigram> I'm in Muizenberg
[07:07] <digigram> and my house is in Parys... ffs, 120km from Jhb and 300km from Bloem
[07:07] <digigram> atleast we are 4mbps capable
[07:08] <digigram> better than the EDGE I use down here
[07:08] <superfly> digigram: where in Muizenberg?
[07:08] <digigram> Marina da Gama
[07:08] <superfly> ah, yes
[07:08] <digigram> wish iburst had reception here
[07:09] <superfly> digigram: I know a guy who live(s/d) in Capricorn Beach who used iBurst
[07:09] <digigram> lucky him
[07:09] <superfly> digigram: what does telkom say when you ask for ADSL?
[07:09] <digigram> lol
[07:10] <digigram> I don't live here permanently superfly, so getting ADSL will be a waste
[07:10] <superfly> ah, right
[07:10] <superfly> digigram: studying?
[07:10] <digigram> I have ADSL at home for the wife, but I travel for work, living a week or two each 2 months in Muizenberg
[07:10] <superfly> ah
[07:11] <digigram> iBurst does not pick up anything where I live, so now I waste 20gigs per month on that lol
[07:11] <superfly> heh.
[07:11] <superfly> have you tried Vodacom? I was getting 3.6Mbps on 3G when I used Vodacom
[07:12] <digigram> I'm using Cell C for the price...
[07:12] <digigram> as I don't want a contract
[07:12] <digigram> later today I'll be in Mosselbaai for 3 weeks, and there we have ADSL
[07:12] <digigram> then I'll be in the states for 2 months
[07:12] <superfly> wow, you get around, don't you? :-)
[07:12] <digigram> then offshore for a month
[07:12] <digigram> so a contract is just a waste
[07:14] <magespawn> anybody have experince with backtrack 5?
[07:14] <superfly> magespawn: nope
[07:14] <superfly> digigram: what work do you do that takes you around so much?
[07:15] <digigram> I opened it magespawn, then decided I don't really need it, and dd'd the flash
[07:15] <digigram> so that counts as a no
[07:15] <digigram> superfly: drilling fluids engineer for oil rigs
[07:15] <magespawn> digigram: sounds like fun
[07:16] <superfly> digigram: so what brings you to muizenberg?
[07:16] <digigram> I'll tell you when my training is done lol
[07:16] <digigram> our Sub Sahara office is in Westlake superfly 
[07:16] <magespawn> backtack is ubuntu based with a couple of quirks and loads of extra software
[07:16] <superfly> ah
[07:17] <digigram> yeah I know, I have used BT4 a bit magespawn 
[07:17] <digigram> looks really nice
[07:17] <digigram> is very good if you are going to use it
[07:18] <digigram> bit for my purposes its not suited, so I did the linux thing and downloaded another distro :)...
[07:18] <magespawn> it does make life interesting when you configure everything
[07:18]  * digigram loves choices
[07:19]  * magespawn is running it on an old spare laptop
[07:20] <digigram> is all 8gig flash drives the same size? I reckon there might be a few kilobytes differences right?
[07:23] <magespawn> there might also be applications on some
[07:23] <digigram> and if you dd it?
[07:24] <digigram> I'm running my MINT from a flash drive, and it works great. I make weekly backups of the drive using dd, since liveUSB has a tendency to fail sometimes with me
[07:24] <magespawn> no idea never tried that
[07:24] <digigram> now I'm just wondering what will happen if I try to dd that image to a new flash
[07:25] <digigram> want to get one of those kingston tiny drives that will not try to bend everytime the laptop isn't perfectly level
[07:26] <superfly> Flash drives have a finite lifespan
[07:27] <digigram> yeah I know, so I'd rather have an option to replace it when I reach that
[07:27] <digigram> luckily they aren't as expensive these days
[07:30] <nuvolari> lol
[07:30] <nuvolari> mornings
[07:30] <nuvolari> more oom Kilos 
[07:30] <nuvolari> nope, I was not washed away
[07:30] <digigram> wanted to boot of microSD, but laptop does not support it with the internal card reader...
[07:30] <nuvolari> morning everyone
[07:30] <magespawn> hey nuvolari
[07:30] <henkj> morning
[07:31] <magespawn> is Kilos asleep or chasing sheep?
[07:31] <magespawn> hey henkj
[07:31] <Kilos> hmm
[07:32] <Kilos> have done and watching the chats about gaming and connection speeds etc
[07:32] <Kilos> lo nuvolari 
[07:34] <digigram> does anybody have a kingston tiny thumb drive or patriot flex in 8GB size? would like to know how many bytes it takes
[07:34] <magespawn> hold a sec
[07:35] <theblazehen> won't iit be fine if the last few blocks dont make it ?
[07:35] <digigram> I'm not sure theblazehen 
[07:35] <magespawn> one way to find out
[07:35] <digigram> yeah lol
[07:36] <magespawn> no only have a 4gb kingston traveler
[07:36] <digigram> maybe I should try tonight to forcefully skip the last few blocks
[07:36] <digigram> to see if it works
[07:36] <theblazehen> yeah
[07:37] <digigram> or maybe next week, can't really dd to the USB I'm running my OS from lol
[07:37] <Trixar_za> All the patriot drives I got ended up being corrupted
[07:37] <Trixar_za> so I don't trust them
[07:37] <Trixar_za> :P
[07:37] <digigram> Id prefer something else as well
[07:37] <digigram> but corrupt is better than bent, corrupt I can just get my backup and dd that on
[07:38] <Trixar_za> Also depending on the Linux distro, 4GB can be more than enough space
[07:38] <Trixar_za> Won't recommend it for Ubuntu though, unless you start off with Ubuntu mini
[07:38] <digigram> I'm using Mint, 4GB is enough, but you run out very quickly
[07:39] <digigram> Its okay for if you just do stuff quickly, but not as a primary
[07:39]  * digigram should go finish the dishes before the airport transfer arrives
[07:40] <mazal> For the clever guys that might be able to help me: http://askubuntu.com/questions/240324/ive-disabled-periodic-checks-for-updates-why-does-it-still-do-so
[07:42] <Kilos> hi mazal there one more place where it says notify of updates
[07:42] <Kilos> in update manager
[07:42] <Kilos> you tell it never to check and also untick the notify one
[07:43] <mazal> My update manager is already set to "never check"
[07:44] <Kilos> check for that other block as well
[07:45] <Kilos> in updates untick the other blocks
[07:45] <mazal> Where ?
[07:45] <Kilos> update manager
[07:45] <mazal> The notify ones ?
[07:46] <Kilos> ya
[07:46] <mazal> That just tells you if there are , doesn't set the checking
[07:46] <mazal> Unless it's a bug
[07:46] <Kilos> oh i thought its that notification you dont want
[07:47] <mazal> I don't want it to check at all
[07:47] <Kilos> then untick everything
[07:47] <mazal> It's been working fine for about 6 months on that install
[07:47] <mazal> Only started ignoring that setting about a week ago or so
[07:47] <Kilos> oh
[07:48] <mazal> I wonder if software wise something updated and now there is a bug
[07:48] <mazal> Maybe update manager updated a week or so ago
[07:48] <superfly> mazal: not a clue
[07:48] <mazal> Can't remember , when there are plenty of updates I never bother to check what is being updated
[07:49] <digigram> maybe they tried what Windows did a while ago. They overrode the "do not install security updates" option a couple of years ago
[07:49] <digigram> in one nonsuspicious update
[07:50] <mazal> But then surely more people should have this problem
[07:50] <mazal> But then again , almost everyone works with the setting to check automatically on so will not notice this problem
[07:53]  * digigram really needs ons of those portable bag scales
[07:56] <Trixar_za> Considering the route Ubuntu is going, I wouldn't put that past them
[07:56] <digigram> I know Trixar_za otherwise I wouldn't even try to joke and compare them to MS hehe
[08:03] <magespawn> digigram: a hanging fishing scale works nicely
[08:03] <digigram> yeah thats what I had in mind
[08:03] <digigram> will get a 40kg one
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[08:16] <N8Wulf> good morning all
[08:16] <Kilos> hi N8Wulf 
[08:16] <N8Wulf> how you all? Week long so far for you too?
[08:17] <Kilos> lol its monday
[08:17] <N8Wulf> shhhhh...
[08:18] <N8Wulf> i really dont feel like working yet. think i need to get back to some fishing
[08:18] <Kilos> haha
[08:18] <Kilos> where yo go fishing?
[08:19] <N8Wulf> did a bit of river fishing here in sasolburg, next to the Vaal. I'm busy planning a Vaaldam trip for next weekend or maybe month end
[08:20] <Kilos> nice
[08:21] <Kilos> you need to work so you can rest after hard weekends
[08:21] <N8Wulf> got some nice fishing tips from a house maintenance guy last week who belongs to a club... applied and finally caught a Carp of 2Kg, first one in about 30 years worth enmntioning
[08:21] <N8Wulf> *mentioning
[08:21] <N8Wulf> so yeahhh! quite eager now
[08:24] <barrydk> What is going on this morning?  why does everyone talk about the things i love to do but can't. If it's not online gaming its fishing
[08:24] <digigram> lol barrydk 
[08:24] <Kilos> N8Wulf, like this? http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/850/img20121231wa0008.jpg/
[08:24] <digigram> well, bye everyone, let me go check out the 37 seater jet they want me to fly on....
[08:24] <Kilos> lol @ barrydk 
[08:24]  * digigram shakes his head in disbelief
[08:25] <N8Wulf> barrydk: maybe b'cause we all would rather still be in the holidays instead of at work
[08:26] <barrydk> What holdays, i only went on the garden route during Christmas week, you know the one around the house
[08:27] <Kilos> sorry pc rebooted
[08:27] <Kilos> sigh
[08:27] <N8Wulf> i did the garden route as well... luckily i stay in Sasolburg, so the river is about 5km from my house
[08:27] <Kilos> nice
[08:28] <N8Wulf> Kilos: I wish... mine was about a 1/4 of that monster
[08:28] <N8Wulf> I took a photo with my Cellphone as well, but I made sure the camera is real close so the fish looks big
[08:28] <Kilos> when you get the urge and have lotsa petrol money go fishing in Bloemhof dam
[08:28] <Kilos> lol
[08:29] <Kilos> massive barble there too
[08:29] <barrydk> I use to do a lot of fishing in the vaa river and dam. I lived in Vereeniging and Meyerton in my schooldays. 
[08:29] <Kilos> ah
[08:29] <N8Wulf> got Bloemhof planned maybe for last week in February yes, and then from there I'm off to Scottsburg for 10 days
[08:29] <barrydk>  Don't talk bout Bloemhof very good fishing spot
[08:31] <N8Wulf> I DL'd Netrunner, just gonna give it a quick Live preview, BBL
[08:34] <Kilos> môre inetpro 
[08:34] <inetpro> elo kios
[08:34] <Kilos> hehe
[09:08] <magespawn> gotta love eskom
[09:25] <Kilos> what now magespawn 
[09:25] <Kilos> hehe
[09:50] <N8Wulf> Hmmmm... guess what I'm up to
[09:50] <Kilos> tell
[09:51] <N8Wulf> I like the Netrunner Flavour... never been a big fan of KDE, this one has me Backing up for a fullOn change over though
[09:55] <N8Wulf> quick Q: anybody know of any utils that can make a list of  "My Installed Apps" ?
[09:55] <Kilos> lol you might wait for a quick A:
[09:55] <Kilos> just be patient
[09:55] <mazal> In KDE ?
[09:56] <mazal> Or Unity ?
[09:56] <N8Wulf> One thing I'd like Canonical to add to the Software Centre... Login with your Ubuntu Forums Account into Software centre and it will update what you are using... similar to the Android Play Store
[09:56] <N8Wulf> I'm on Unity/Gnome now
[09:57] <mazal> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1861624
[09:57] <N8Wulf> I've got 200Gb to backup to make a fresh start again for 2013
[09:58] <N8Wulf> so I'll be here for another hour or so
[09:58] <mazal> Try that in that forum post N8Wulf 
[09:58] <mazal> Should give you a list
[09:58] <N8Wulf> TY mazal
[09:59] <mazal> Never used it myself yet , hope it helps ;)
[10:00] <N8Wulf> Ahhhh.... Linux is sooo cool, as always. Always a way to skin the Cat. Ubuntu's Logo should be changed to a Devon Rex I think
[10:01] <N8Wulf> or maybe swap the Penguin for a Devon Rex
[10:01] <mazal> I have no idea what a Devon Rex is :P
[10:03] <mazal> There's another way with synaptic as well , but can't remember it now
[10:03] <N8Wulf> mazal.. those cat's with the really short hair, they almost look and feel like they are Hairless
[10:04] <N8Wulf> ... been skinned too many times
[10:04] <N8Wulf> :p
[10:05] <mazal> Ah ok
[10:06] <mazal> Here's another one , but don't know how well it works , never used this: Synaptec Package Manager - file - Generate package download script
[10:06] <mazal> BUT , I think that will only be from Ubuntu to another Ubuntu
[10:06] <mazal> Don't think that should be considered for Ubuntu to Kubuntu
[10:06] <magespawn> Kilos going off and on today Kilos
[10:07] <Kilos> me?
[10:07] <Kilos> i dont see it
[10:11] <magespawn> no me
[10:12] <magespawn> sorry that was meant to be "Power going of and on today Kilos"
[10:19] <N8Wulf> mmmm.... Vetkoek en Chilli Mince for lunch
[10:41] <inetpro> N8Wulf: dpkg --get-selections
[10:42] <Kilos> aw magespawn that sucks
[10:44] <inetpro> N8Wulf: or dpkg -l
[10:45] <mazal> inetpro, only one problem I have with all those methods
[10:46] <inetpro> mazal: what problem?
[10:46] <mazal> It sounded like N8Wulf wants it because of moving to Kubuntu ( I might be wrong)
[10:46] <mazal> Then most on that list should not b installed again as it is default ubuntu apps
[10:47] <mazal> I wonder if there is a way to see non-default apps. IE apps that the user added
[10:48] <inetpro> well I just answered the question 14/01 11:55:02 <N8Wulf> quick Q: anybody know of any utils that can make a list of  "My Installed Apps" ?
[10:48] <N8Wulf> @mazal... now you are talking. I followed your last suggestion and as said it creates a COMPLETE package list
[10:48]  * inetpro didn't read everything that was said
[10:48] <mazal> N8Wulf, I thought as much :P
[10:49] <mazal> I unfortunately don't know how to get just user installed apps list
[10:49] <inetpro> there's no difference
[10:50] <mazal> inetpro, meaning ?
[10:50] <inetpro> at least, not that I am aware of 
[10:50] <inetpro> it's all user installed
[10:50] <mazal> Isn't all the default ubuntu apps also on that list inetpro ?
[10:50] <N8Wulf> including dependancies then I suppose
[10:51] <inetpro> all installed by the admin user
[10:51] <mazal> Like for example brasero etc
[10:52] <mazal> Indeed it does , just checked
[10:52] <mazal> So one won't be able to use that when moving to kubuntu
[10:52] <N8Wulf> I read about a FUI App long time ago that will list and then enable you to install the same Selection on a number of Workstations among others
[10:53] <N8Wulf> *GUI
[10:53] <N8Wulf> (eating and typing cause Typos)
[10:53] <mazal> hmm , this is an interesting thing. I would like to find an app that shows only user installed
[10:54] <N8Wulf> I had a Ref to it on my Delicious bookmarks, but my account died somehow and with it all my bookmarks
[10:54] <mazal> I myself keep and updated build document where I manually add and update it myself , but would like to find an app for it
[10:57] <mazal> N8Wulf, you know you could only add kubuntu-desktop to your current install ne ?
[10:57] <mazal> Or you don't want it that way ?
[10:58] <N8Wulf> feeling like a fresh start... and I like to test different Flavs so i can recommend based on experience
[10:58] <mazal> k
[10:59] <mazal> I almooooooost wanted to check out the new Kubuntu last week
[10:59] <mazal> Fortunately the feeling went over hehehehe
[11:00] <superfly> mazal: so you went back to complaining about Unity, GTK3 and Gnome Shell?
[11:00] <N8Wulf> sies man
[11:00] <N8Wulf> lol
[11:00] <mazal> When did I complain superfly ?
[11:00] <mazal> Only remember my updates not working thing
[11:01] <N8Wulf> I see the Steam for Linux catalogue is growing steadily
[11:02] <N8Wulf> 42 Games so far
[11:04] <mazal> N8Wulf, I didn't have the strength for all the apt-get's , otherwise I would have
[11:05] <N8Wulf> and that's why I prefer to start with a Flavour somebody else already tweaked. did you have a look at the Netrunner screenshots?
[11:06] <mazal> My problem is , there is so many extra apps I add that I need , sjoe , takes a lot of time and data to get everything installed
[11:07] <mazal> And I am happy with ubuntu as it is now (12.04 )
[11:07] <mazal> I like Unity and mis the dash when working on an OS that doesn't have that quick searching
[11:08] <N8Wulf> I've got a Apt-Cache here on my network, so I don't download as much the second time around
[11:09] <mazal> I backup mine as well
[11:09] <mazal> But have been told that it will work only for the same version ubuntu
[11:09] <mazal> For example if I install Kubuntu , or ubuntu 12.10 , then those debs wont work
[11:10] <N8Wulf> funny how we got used to everything Unity brought and taught us. I also cant wait to move over or add Ubuntu to my Android phone
[11:15] <mazal> When it started I was one of the haters. Spent some time with K and X ubuntus. Then with 12.04 decided to give Unity a go again. Now I like it
[11:20] <N8Wulf> any of you guys using the Cairo Dock?
[11:22] <N8Wulf> I've been using AWN and Docky forever, curious though about the ratings you would give to each?
[11:26] <N8Wulf> I'm going home... Speak you again soon, thanx for the recommendations

[13:43] <magespawn> superfly: have you heard of/used scapy?
[14:18] <superfly> magespawn: you mean scipy?
[14:31] <Kilos> hey guys is it possible to block a number from sms you on a nokia 6111
[14:31] <Kilos> sis being bugged 
[14:31] <magespawn> no scapy
[14:31] <magespawn> a network scanner etc written in python
[14:32]  * magespawn goes to google scipy
[14:32] <magespawn> not sure Kilos
[14:32] <Kilos> imo i think you cant block smses
[14:33] <magespawn> i think you can block the number though
[14:33] <magespawn> sales or other stuff?
[14:33] <tumbleweed> Kilos: if you file a police complaint, the provider can block it
[14:33] <Kilos> ya from calling but not smses
[14:33] <Kilos> ty tumbleweed thats a bit too harsh here
[14:34] <Kilos> its her sons satan spawned wife giving hassles
[14:34] <tumbleweed> hah
[14:35] <magespawn> put that number in its own caller group then set the message tone to muted
[14:35] <magespawn> you could also group delete the sms so you do not have to read them
[14:36] <Kilos> eek how you do that magespawn 
[14:36] <magespawn> will have to look it up, have never used the 6111
[14:36] <magespawn> let me check

[16:24] <Cantide> lol
[16:24] <N8Wulf> So far so good... The Team behind Netrunner really had their own ideas on doing everything. Even renaming Common Options like Desktop Options to "Folder View Settings"
[16:26] <N8Wulf> English yes... but the only guy online for support on IRC thought I'm Hardegat toe ek met hom Afrikaans wou praat omdat hy nie Engels wil praat nie
[16:26] <N8Wulf> brb

[16:26] <magespawn> Howdy all
[16:26] <Kilos> hey magespawn 
[16:26] <magespawn> What up?
[16:27] <Kilos> ive realised if one wants help you have to be very gentlemanly even if the helper treats you a bit rough
[16:27] <Kilos> N8Wulf, struggling some magespawn 
[16:28] <magespawn> N8Wulf what is Netrunner?
[16:28] <Kilos> i thought he was gonna install kubuntu but he is sukkeling with a game

[16:37] <magespawn> Wizards of the Coast
[16:38] <magespawn> Company does a lot of fantasy gaming and trading cards etc
[16:39] <magespawn> I used to play Magic:The Gathering a lot
[16:40] <nlsthzn> MTG rocks
[16:40] <magespawn> Indeed not much of a scene in Hluhluwe though
[16:41] <nlsthzn> 0 in the UAE... which sucks
[16:41] <nlsthzn> short drive over to Qatar and they have a thriving community... go figure
[16:42] <N8Wulf> Netrunner-os
[16:42] <magespawn> One of those curve balls life likes to through us
[16:42] <N8Wulf> www.netrunner-os.com
[16:42] <Kilos> throw
[16:42] <magespawn> The link Kilos gave was to the game loll
[16:42] <nlsthzn> netrunner has the same backers as Kubuntu
[16:43]  * nlsthzn is just saying
[16:43] <nlsthzn> and with that I go for a baff and a bet
[16:44] <Kilos> hehe looks good N8Wulf but if the support sucks then what
[16:45] <Kilos> hiya byya nlsthzn 
[16:45] <Kilos> come back clean
[16:49] <magespawn> Any major differences between netrunner-os and the others?
[16:49] <Kilos> yeah the peeps you get help from
[16:50] <magespawn> Hah lol
[16:50] <Kilos> hehe
[16:51] <Kilos> the thing to do is get the fly to install it then you get good help
[16:51] <Kilos> yo aquarat 
[16:51] <aquarat> hey kilos
[16:52] <magespawn> superfly batter up
[16:56] <magespawn> Anyway I am off, dinner and family
[16:56] <Kilos> enjoy
[17:21] <Kilos> hi kbmonkey theblazehen 
[17:22] <theblazehen> hi kilos
[17:24] <roryy> ello all
[17:24] <Kilos> hey roryy 
[17:24] <kbmonkey> hello hello!
[17:24] <roryy> about a week ago i said I was going to ask the HP shop in sandton if I could try out Ubuntu before buying
[17:24] <Kilos> yes?
[17:24] <roryy> the staff were very helpful and let me do so - unfortunately it didn't work
[17:25] <Kilos> aw
[17:25] <roryy> yeah, bit annoying
[17:25] <Kilos> what didnt work?
[17:25] <roryy> it seemed to get through the secure boot OK, then gave a kernel fault
[17:25] <kbmonkey> that was kind of them to at least try :)
[17:25] <roryy> yeah, the sales dude was interested
[17:25] <roryy> let him have the copy of ubuntu 12.10
[17:26] <Kilos> roryy, if you look back in our mailing lists there were some lappys that could be bought with ubuntu on
[17:26] <kbmonkey> a kernel fault is a pretty serious showstopper
[17:26] <kbmonkey> wonder what could have cause it
[17:27] <roryy> Kilos: ok.  are there archives on-line?  I'm about to compare the list of "certified" laptops on canonical's site with what's available at laptopdirect
[17:27] <roryy> my current laptop is dying - screen switches off if I open it too far.
[17:27] <Kilos> whew youll have to maybe ask in the list , someone gave the links
[17:27] <Kilos> aw that yuck
[17:28] <Kilos> inetpro, where can one see archives of our list?
[17:30] <Kilos> superfly, bloody hot there tomorrow
[17:30] <Kilos> bloedig warm
[17:30] <Kilos> hmm 31°c
[17:30] <Kilos> not too bad
[17:31] <Kilos> roryy, thats most likely them cable connectors
[17:31] <Kilos> maybe you can get them
[17:32] <Kilos> but lappy's are terrible things to pull apart
[17:32] <kbmonkey> roryy, there are archives of mailing lists online
[17:32] <kbmonkey> but there is no search function, so finding the info you want on there is tricky
[17:32] <roryy> Kilos: it's oldish anyway - usb ports are flaky, hard drive is getting full, etc.
[17:32] <Kilos> ai
[17:32] <roryy> Kilos: it's put in yeoman service, but it's time for it to retire
[17:33] <Kilos> lol
[17:33] <Kilos> how old is it
[17:33] <roryy> um
[17:33] <roryy> 5 years i think
[17:33] <Kilos> there is still lotsa years in it
[17:34] <Kilos> like mage runs one without a harddrive from usb
[17:34] <Kilos> hehe
[17:34] <Kilos> there must be replacement connectors available
[17:35] <Kilos> unles they are soldered into the mb then you are lost
[17:35] <Kilos> unless
[17:37] <roryy> i guess
[17:37] <roryy> i haven't soldered anything in 10 years
[17:38] <Kilos> hehe you a ballie hey
[17:38] <roryy> urban dictionary says you're implying i'm old by that remark
[17:38] <roryy> :-p
[17:38] <Kilos> im still trying to solder a sata cable to a busted 500g drive
[17:38] <Kilos> lol
[17:39] <Kilos> actually trying to build up the courage to do it
[17:39] <Kilos> kbmonkey, hows things with you laddy
[17:40] <kbmonkey> fine oom Kilos 
[17:40] <Kilos> tumbleweed, is gonna help us with the greeter script

[17:41] <kbmonkey> hows it that side, Kilos ?
[17:41] <Kilos> only if i ctrl+c the terminal she is running on
[17:41] <Kilos> good ty kbmonkey 
[17:41] <kbmonkey> it should not greet when it joins a channel though
[17:41] <kbmonkey> its not that kind of greeter. lol
[17:41] <Kilos> lol
[17:42] <Kilos> only is she is rudely ctrl+c ed
[17:42] <Kilos> if i say die it dont happen on restart
[17:42] <Kilos> yo digigram 
[17:46] <digigram> hey kilos
[17:48] <Kilos> ekk reboot prob is back
[17:55] <smile> hi Kilos, inetpro and others :)
[17:56] <Kilos> hi smile 
[17:56] <Cantide> smile o/
[18:05] <smile> :DD
[18:13] <inetpro> good morning smile
[18:14] <inetpro> Kilos: https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-za
[18:14] <smile> good morning :p
[18:14] <smile> :)
[18:14] <inetpro> Kilos: just follow the link above
[18:14] <Kilos> ty inetpro roryy ^^
[18:15] <roryy> awesome, ta
[18:15] <Kilos> ive gone back 350 but not seen one yet
[18:15] <Kilos> they were before 12.10 was released methinks
[18:16] <roryy> https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flists.ubuntu.com%2Farchives%2Fubuntu-za+laptop&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gl=za
[18:16] <roryy> (apologies for long link)
[18:17] <Kilos> roryy, if you pm maaz and tell him shorten he does it for you
[18:17] <roryy> huh.  if I install ubuntu I void the warranty on a dell?
[18:17] <roryy> that kinda sucks
[18:17] <Kilos> Maaz, shorten https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=site%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Flists.ubuntu.com%2Farchives%2Fubuntu-za+laptop&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gl=za
[18:17] <Maaz> Kilos: That reduces to: http://is.gd/PU3B1D
[18:18] <Kilos> there was talk about someone supplying lappies with ubuntu preinstalled
[18:18]  * inetpro would never use windows on a dell
[18:18] <inetpro> ubuntu just works perfect
[18:19] <smile> :DD
[18:19] <inetpro> warranty should have nothing to do with the os
[18:21] <roryy> yeah, someone in the thread says he was told it wouldn't void the warranty
[18:21] <kbmonkey> no it should not, but reality does not work well with morality
[18:22] <kbmonkey> roryy, you can use clonezilla and clone the disk as is
[18:23] <kbmonkey> so if for any reason you one day need to hand it in for warranty reasons, you can restore the original drive data
[18:29] <inetpro> well I can tell you if Dell where to enforce a stupid warranty rule like that they would loose a massive amount of business
[18:33] <inetpro> s/where/were/
[18:33] <roryy> inetpro: yeah, i'm not sure the complaint was legit
[18:34] <Kilos> hmm
[18:34] <inetpro> wb Kilos
[18:35] <Kilos> ty inetpro 2nd time now when moving mouse pc reboots
[18:35] <Kilos> earlier it was when typing here so i changed the keyboard
[18:35] <Kilos> now twice with mouse move
[18:35] <Kilos> grrrr
[18:37] <kbmonkey> grrr
[18:38] <Kilos> somethong in the usb stuff
[18:38] <Kilos> grrr
[18:39] <Kilos> no keyboard was ps2
[18:39] <kbmonkey> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSystemCrash
[18:39] <Kilos> ty
[18:40] <kbmonkey> for the next time it crashes, it might help us see what caused it
[18:40] <kbmonkey> that #2.2
[18:40] <Kilos> me looks
[18:43] <Kilos> whats that  Alt+SysRq+1it does a reboot same as if you shutdown and say restart
[18:44] <Kilos>  Alt+SysRq
[18:44] <Kilos> where is that key sysrq
[18:44] <Kilos> or do i type it in
[18:45] <roryy> think it might be pause?
[18:45] <roryy> oh, no, it varies - i see it on delete on my keyboard here
[18:45] <Kilos> wait i see it
[18:45] <roryy> Fn-delete it would be
[18:46] <Kilos> lay back inna chair to ponder the situation and see it on the front of the print screen key
[18:46] <roryy> i'm off to be
[18:46] <Kilos> wow never saw that before
[18:46] <roryy> cheers all
[18:46] <Kilos> cheers roorrrr
[18:46] <Kilos> ninnige fanie
[18:47] <Kilos> vinnige
[18:50] <charl> good evening
[18:50] <charl> Maaz: coffee on
[18:50]  * Maaz flips the salt-timer
[18:50] <kbmonkey> discovering new keys on your keyboard, Kilos?
[18:50] <Kilos> yeah
[18:50] <Kilos> hehe hi charl 
[18:51] <charl> hi Kilos 
[18:54] <Maaz> Coffee's ready for charl!
[18:54] <charl> Maaz: thanks
[18:54] <Maaz> charl: No problem
[18:54] <charl> wow lenovo is busy with some interesting stuff
[18:55] <charl> their ideapad looks a lot like apple's laptops http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/desktop/ideacentre/horizon/
[18:56] <charl> their desktops look very stylish http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/desktop/
[18:56] <charl> seems like they are shedding the ibm thinkpad "stereotype" :)
[19:01] <Kilos> inetpro, them cat and tail commands are for running pc hey?
[19:01] <Kilos> /var/log/syslog
[19:01] <kbmonkey> wow that looks nice charl 
[19:02] <kbmonkey> I have the thinkpad laptop. they have lovely linux compatible hardware.
[19:04] <inetpro> Kilos: uh?
[19:04] <inetpro> (head;tail) < /var/log/syslog
[19:04] <Kilos> i mean they wont show why pc rebooted will they?
[19:05] <inetpro> Kilos: hmm... depends
[19:06] <inetpro> Kilos: (head;tail) < /var/log/syslog | nl
[19:06] <Kilos> http://slexy.org/view/s2xAhWk1wu
[19:06] <inetpro> the first ten lines would be the beginning and the last 10 the end
[19:07] <inetpro> Kilos: what's wrong?
[19:07] <Kilos> http://slexy.org/view/s20e3uD2UF
[19:08] <inetpro> Kilos: why you giving me that?
[19:08] <Kilos> pc just reboots on its own while im chatting here or moving mouse is the last 2
[19:08] <inetpro> Kilos: well you should learn to read that log of yours
[19:09] <inetpro> lot's of lines get added during a boot up process
[19:09] <Kilos>    18  Jan 14 20:35:17 P4 kernel: [  264.172456] init: plymouth-stop pre-start process (3260) terminated with status 1
[19:09] <Kilos>     19  Jan 14 20:39:28 P4 AptDaemon: INFO: Quitting due to inactivity
[19:09] <Kilos>     20  Jan 14 20:39:28 P4 AptDaemon: INFO: Quitting was requested
[19:09] <Kilos> oh
[19:09] <inetpro> so the trick is to find the lines just before the startup
[19:09] <inetpro> look at the time
[19:09] <Kilos> not in the shutdown process
[19:10] <Kilos>     10  Jan 14 09:17:01 P4 CRON[2996]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)
[19:11] <Kilos> i dunno what time it rebooted
[19:11] <Kilos> is that it
[19:11] <inetpro> less /var/log/syslog
[19:11] <inetpro> with less you can scroll up and down
[19:11] <inetpro> then the time should be clear
[19:12] <inetpro> anything within the same few seconds would be part of a specific sequence
[19:12] <inetpro> like a bootup sequence
[19:12] <Kilos> does quassel show what time i went off?
[19:13] <inetpro> Kilos: that won't help
[19:13] <Kilos> oh
[19:13] <inetpro> because it will only show after a while
[19:13] <inetpro> after the timeout
[19:13] <inetpro> Kilos: last
[19:14] <inetpro> last | head
[19:14] <inetpro> that should show you when it booted
[19:14] <inetpro> last reboot
[19:15] <inetpro> or even better ^^
[19:15] <Kilos> without the | head
[19:15] <inetpro> use q to quit out of less
[19:15] <inetpro> Kilos: last reboot
[19:16] <inetpro> well if there are to many of those use | head
[19:16] <inetpro> because you're interested in the latest
[19:16] <inetpro> which is at the top
[19:17]  * inetpro only has 4 reboot lines since 3 Jan
[19:17] <kbmonkey> Kilos, that syslog can get a ton of messages during reboot
[19:17] <Kilos> reboot   system boot  3.2.0-35-generic Mon Jan 14 20:32 - 21:17  (00:45) 
[19:17] <inetpro> Kilos: ahh
[19:19] <Kilos> thats     10  Jan 14 09:17:01 P4 CRON[2996]: (root) CMD (   cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly)
[19:19] <Kilos> its my unity messing around not the hardware hey?
[19:20] <inetpro> Kilos: look at just before 20:32
[19:20] <charl> kbmonkey: i also have a lenovo laptop, the b560
[19:20] <Kilos> on the first paste inetpro ?
[19:21] <inetpro> Kilos: no man
[19:21] <inetpro> in your logs
[19:21] <Kilos> ai
[19:21] <inetpro> the paste was useless
[19:21]  * inetpro was still trying to figure what your problem was
[19:22] <charl> nn all!
[19:22] <inetpro> Kilos: less /var/log/syslog
[19:23] <inetpro> kbmonkey: and yes I agree, theres lots to read in a syslog file
[19:24] <kbmonkey> Kilos, looked at the paste, does not look like all the lines there
[19:24] <kbmonkey> grab the whole log right after a crash
[19:25] <Kilos> less /var/log/syslog
[19:25] <inetpro> kbmonkey: that's just the first 10 lines and the last 10, pointless really
[19:28] <inetpro> Kilos: apt-get install pastebinit
[19:29] <inetpro> then:
[19:29] <inetpro> pastebinit -a Kilos -i /var/log/syslog
[19:30] <Kilos> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1531773/
[19:31] <Kilos> snazzy command that
[19:31] <inetpro> true
[19:32] <smile> byee :)
[19:32] <inetpro> hmm...
[19:32] <inetpro> Kilos: looks like you're out of luck
[19:33] <Kilos> tell
[19:33] <smile> good night Kilos & inetpro 
[19:33] <smile> :p
[19:33] <Kilos> night smile 
[19:33] <inetpro> surely you were not offline for longer than half an hour?
[19:34] <kbmonkey> Kilos, did your pc crash between those times where there are gaps in the time?
[19:34] <inetpro> looks like whatever caused a reboot was not logged
[19:34] <kbmonkey> if so, it seems to happen on the 17th minute of each hour
[19:34] <Kilos> 3 times today
[19:34] <Kilos> twice tonight'
[19:34] <kbmonkey> your right, that hourly cronjob
[19:34] <kbmonkey> and it does not log the error itself
[19:35] <Kilos> so is that in unity or the pc itself
[19:35] <inetpro> 14/01 20:32:36 <-- Kilos (~miles@unaffiliated/kilos) has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
[19:35] <inetpro> 14/01 20:34:28 --> Kilos (~miles@unaffiliated/kilos) has joined #ubuntu-za
[19:36] <kbmonkey> did you try that step from the ubuntu help link?
[19:36] <kbmonkey> sysreq+1 and sysreq+t
[19:36] <Kilos> it hasnt crashed again kbmonkey 
[19:36] <inetpro> that cron at 20:17 was long before the crash
[19:36] <Kilos> must i do that while its rebooting
[19:36] <kbmonkey> no,
[19:37] <kbmonkey> from what I gather, those commands will drop you to a terminal and it will dump the trace log on screen
[19:37] <Kilos> ai
[19:37] <Kilos> you know when you go shutdown and choose restart
[19:37] <Kilos> the pc clicks and strats rebooting
[19:38] <Kilos> starts
[19:38] <Kilos> no time to sys anykey
[19:38] <kbmonkey> it reboots itself right away
[19:38] <kbmonkey> hmm
[19:38] <Kilos> yes 
[19:39] <Kilos> it doesnt do any crash thing just reboots
[19:39] <kbmonkey> ai
[19:39] <kbmonkey> that is naughty
[19:39] <kbmonkey> well I would try reseath the RAM chips just in case
[19:40] <kbmonkey> reseat
[19:41] <Kilos> ok will try that and run memory test
[19:41] <Kilos> ty
[19:42] <inetpro> play a game of chess
[19:42] <kbmonkey> i forgot what the technical name is, but its known over time heating and cooling can slowly move ram chips to the point where their contacts lose point
[19:42] <Kilos> why did the pro say im outa luck
[19:42] <inetpro> Kilos: ai!
[19:42] <kbmonkey> ooh chess
[19:42] <inetpro> Kilos: looks like whatever caused a reboot was not logged
[19:43] <Kilos> oh is that all
[19:43] <Kilos> hehe
[19:43] <inetpro> yes
[19:43]  * Kilos hugs inetpro 
[19:43] <Kilos> haha
[19:43]  * inetpro runs away
[19:43] <kbmonkey> haha
[19:43] <kbmonkey> free hugs!
[19:43] <Kilos> thought you were gonna say mb faulty
[19:44]  * inetpro didn't grow up with hugging tendencies
[19:44] <Kilos> hahahaha
[19:45] <Kilos> i see smile gets you worried now i got another stick to wallop yuou with
[19:45] <inetpro> ai!
[19:45] <Kilos> lol ok guys ty for the help. will catch you tomorrow with good news i hope
