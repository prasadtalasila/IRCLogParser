[01:13] <ajmitch> hads: what'd you get?
[01:21] <thumper> hads: it lies
[01:21] <thumper> hads: it doesn't have four siblings
[01:21] <thumper> there are four of them :)
[01:25] <G> hads: wow, thats pretty rocking
[01:48] <hads> ajmitch: It's an Intel NUC, a little thing the size of a...
[01:49] <hads> small square block of cheese or something.
[01:49] <hads> I can't think of a good comparison.
[01:49] <mwhudson> not http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuc
[01:50] <hads> Different NUC :)
[01:50] <hads> http://www.silentpcreview.com/files/images/intel-nuc/nuc1.jpg
[01:51] <hads> So far I have discovered that it's really good at running XBMC.
[01:51] <mwhudson> that's pretty tiny
[01:51] <mwhudson> what does it have for storage?  msata ssd?
[01:51] <hads> Yeah
[01:52] <hads> 2 x USB, 2 x HDMI and 1 x GigE on the rear, this is a different model to that picture, black rather than red.
[01:52] <ajmitch> looks pretty minimalist
[01:52] <G> hads: are you using XBMC with DVB-S or -T recordings?
[01:53] <hads> I have DVB-S cards here but not sure I have any recordings handy. It works fine with the Freeview DVB-T recordings though.
[01:53] <mwhudson> i guess this is intel's answer to things like the cotton candy, to some extent?
[01:53] <G> hads: okay, -T was what I was worried about :)
[01:53] <hads> Plays perfectly, no dropped frames.
[01:54] <hads> mwhudson: It seems to be a great answer.
[01:54] <G> I'm becoming really, really tempted to tell the truth
[01:55] <hads> I've always been shy of things with fans but this is really really quiet, I can barely hear it with my ear right on the vent.
[01:55] <hads> Totally inaudible over the ambient noise
[01:55]  * ajmitch wouldn't mind something like that to connect to the TV
[01:56] <ajmitch> the laptop I have for the job is the opposite of quiet
[01:57] <hads> I've tested quite a bunch of things connected to TVs (have 4 HTPC in the house and have for quite a few years), initial impression of this blows everything else out of the water.
[01:57] <ajmitch> I just can't really justify to myself buying more hardware :)
[01:58] <hads> Yeah it isn't super cheap but not bad for what you get.
[01:59] <G> ajmitch: that is my concern, I've lost count of what the total processing capacity in the house is at the moment :)
[01:59] <ajmitch> intel nuc
[01:59] <ajmitch> hm
[02:00] <ajmitch> G: I've got 3 laptops on or around my desk at home
[02:00] <ajmitch> it starts to get a little bit much
[02:01] <G> ajmitch: I've got 3 HP Workstations & a Laptop in one room just for work
[02:01] <ajmitch> I'm trying to cut down on number of systems in use
[02:02] <ajmitch> virtual machines should be good enough for most stuff I want to do now, rather than spare hardware
[19:28] <olly> morning
