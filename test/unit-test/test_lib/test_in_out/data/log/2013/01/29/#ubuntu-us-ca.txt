[02:03] <chrubuntyke> anyone running webcamstudio?
[03:44] <akk> Woo UDS in Oakland again!
=== erichammond1 is now known as erichammond
[21:34]  * MarkDude was curious if anyone in this channel would be offended if I had a Fedora cloak, instead of the student one
[21:36] <pleia2> are you being serious?
[21:37] <pleia2> of course not, and anyone who would be should probably examine their thoughts on open source ;)
[21:37] <MarkDude> Well it is a serious question
[21:37] <MarkDude> My intent at least
[21:38] <MarkDude> Lol, I forgot to shutoff irc client on gf's phone
[21:38] <pleia2> we're all on the same team here :) fedora, ubuntu, mozilla
[21:38] <pleia2> everyone is very welcome
[21:39] <MarkDude> pleia2: the reason I did not get one a while ago, was so that folks could see I was willing to help all sorts of projects
[21:39] <pleia2> I think actions speak louder than cloaks :)
[21:39] <MarkDude> It just occurred to me, most folks likely know that
[21:39] <MarkDude> :)
[21:40] <pleia2> (honestly I think cloaks are silly and wish I didn't have one, but it's required for channel access in some ubuntu channels I need access to)
[21:40] <MarkDude> Oh?
[21:40]  * MarkDude did not know that
[21:41] <MarkDude> Ubuntu has a global-ops setup - I sorta rememebr that
[21:41] <pleia2> my reverse dns is cool! I don't want to cover it up :)
[21:41] <pleia2> yeah, #ubuntu-meeting and -classroom give special access for ubuntu member cloak folks
[21:41] <pleia2> probably some other channels too
[21:51] <MarkDude> Hmmm, I have to know the *secret handshake* to do the same
[21:59] <philipballew> pleia2, have time for a question about UDS?
[22:00] <pleia2> philipballew: we'll see :) ask away
[22:00] <philipballew> The Ubuntu Coffee Co-Op in emmryville wants to suply or sell their coffee their. Who would I ask or talk to about that?
[22:00] <philipballew> https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Ubuntu-Coffee-Cooperative/244079462294239
[22:01] <philipballew> Its where I get my coffee beans. Totally has nothing to do with the name on the bag or anything...
[22:03]  * philipballew should stop asking pleia2 random questions
[22:03] <pleia2> jono: thoughts? ^^
[22:04] <pleia2> not sure what the arrangement is with the hotel so it might not even be allowed to bring additional food on site
[22:06] <philipballew> Yeah me either, I just called them to ask about having a group visit the place, (they know me) and they asked if they could come buy the conference with their coffee.
[22:06] <pleia2> philipballew: anyway, he's where I'd start, the logistical stuff is all canonical
[22:08] <philipballew> true, good point. I don't know who to bug now that marianna is gone.
[22:10] <pleia2> yeah, I don't know :\
[22:10] <philipballew> times, they are a changin
[22:46] <jono> pleia2, sorry, was on a call
[22:46] <jono> philipballew, you should email Michelle Surtees-Myers
[22:46] <jono> I think it is a cool idea
[22:48] <philipballew> jono, alright. I will email her.
[22:48] <jono> thanks philipballew
[22:49] <philipballew> No problem. Apparently they are the people who used to own Ubuntu dot com but forgot to renew it...
[23:26] <MarkDude> philipballew: you know of any Fedoran coffee shops? Maybe Firefox bbq place?
[23:26] <philipballew> MarkDude, Why would I ever want to stop drinking the Ubuntu coffee?
[23:27]  * MarkDude prefers to drink Koolaid with friends :D
[23:27] <MarkDude> Maybe smoothies
[23:28] <MarkDude> jono: I have a few bbq secrets to share with you as nice weather approaches
[23:28] <MarkDude> Master of the grill
[23:40] <jono> MarkDude, awesome :-)
[23:40] <jono> been a while!
