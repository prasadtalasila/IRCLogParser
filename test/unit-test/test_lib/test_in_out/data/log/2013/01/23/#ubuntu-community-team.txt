[10:36] <popey> Good morning.
[12:19] <czajkowski> dpm: one for you http://web.bigblueswing.com/
[12:26] <dpm> czajkowski, thanks! :), I didn't now it
[13:19] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, so achiang and notgary would like to have hangout-on-air sessions - what do we need to do there?
[13:52] <czajkowski> dholbach: good intervie with Leann y
[15:01] <dpm_> dholbach, does UDW start now?
[15:03] <dpm_> dholbach, argh, a week too early!
[15:03] <dpm_> dholbach, I think it's the first time I've had my talk prepared like a week before the event :)
[15:03] <dpm_> ah, well, less work next week
[15:03] <dholbach> haha
[15:04]  * dholbach hugs dpm
[15:04]  * dpm hugs dholbach :)
[15:04] <smartboyhw> dholbach, when is the exact date of UDW?
[15:04] <dpm_> smartboyhw, next week Tuesday, the 29th Jan
[15:05] <smartboyhw> dpm, s***
[15:06] <smartboyhw> It clashes with out QA Team sessions in classroom
[15:06] <smartboyhw> Well guess we have to delay then
[15:11] <dholbach> smartboyhw, which times of the day?
[15:12] <smartboyhw> dholbach, check this out https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Activities/Classroom
[15:12] <dholbach> damn, parts of it clash indeed
[15:13] <smartboyhw> dholbach, we already delayed it once from now to next week, now we have to delay further more:(
[15:14] <dholbach> hm, maybe we could
[15:14] <dholbach> hmhmhm
[15:14] <smartboyhw> dholbach, we = QA team
[15:14] <dholbach> maybe just the clashing sessions need to be moved
[15:14] <smartboyhw> right?
[15:15] <smartboyhw> dholbach, it will look strange for somebody who just listened to the developer sessions
[15:15] <dholbach> what do you mean?
[15:15] <smartboyhw> then saw noskcaj or phillw talking about QA tools
[15:15]  * smartboyhw wants dholbach to look at the timetable carefully:P
[15:16] <dholbach> I don't understand
[15:18] <czajkowski> smartboyhw: best to just spill it out in plain sentences
[15:18] <czajkowski> as it's not clear tbh
[15:18] <smartboyhw> dholbach, after mhall119 session about Unity integration, it then *should* be no session behind. But according to the wiki page I have given you, the session after that is three sessions about TestDrive, KVM and VirtualBox (from the QA Team). That might cause people to go !!??!? when *watching* the session. It will look like as if Ubuntu QA Classroom  Day has gone after UDW. Very weird
[15:18] <dholbach> AFAICS the following sessions conflict with UDW sessions "Against test case and ubuntu-bug", "Following a bug report", "Zsync"
[15:18] <dholbach> smartboyhw, I think that's totally fine - we should be able to tell people "and as a bonus, here's what's next" :)
[15:19] <smartboyhw> dholbach, LOL. But then we must move the order. Since in the wiki page Section 2 sessions ("Against test case and ubuntu-bug" and "following a bug report") should be ahead of Section 3, we need to move them ALL back
[15:20] <dholbach> hmm
[15:21] <smartboyhw> balloons, help!!!
[15:58] <doctormon> I bought some fancy balloons from iparty the other day. Very fancy balloons indeed.
[15:59] <jono> balloons, jcastro, mhall119, dholbach, dpm hangout invite sent
[15:59] <jcastro> AWWW YEAH
[15:59] <balloons> weeee
[16:00] <dholbach> yoohoo
[16:00] <rrnwexec> rrnwexec standing by in the event he is summoned ;)
[16:00] <jcastro> It's taking too long to connect you to this hangout. Try again in a few minutes.
[16:00] <jcastro> I keep getting that
[16:01] <dpm> jono, coming
[16:02] <dholbach> I get error code 49
[16:03] <dholbach> bah, it wants me to reinstall the plugin
[16:27] <coolbhavi> jono, good morning
[16:30] <coolbhavi> jono, I have created a branch to fix few typos in adk and requested merge. Kindly request you to have a look if time permits
[17:14]  * czajkowski strangles mhall119 :)
[17:15] <mhall119> what'd I do now?
[17:16] <czajkowski> I had to redo all those reivewing of projects I did yesterday
[17:16] <czajkowski> you're duplicating my work mister :)
[17:16] <czajkowski> you owe me some corn bread and bbq food at this rate
[17:17] <mhall119> czajkowski: it's ready whenever you want to come and get it :)
[17:32]  * dholbach hugs balloons
[17:32]  * balloons hugs dholbach harder ;-)
[17:33] <balloons> enjoy dholbach.. stay warm my friend
[17:33] <dholbach> I'll try :)
[17:36] <dholbach> all right my friends - have a great rest of your day - see you tomorrow! :)
[17:36]  * dholbach hugs you all
[17:37] <JoseeAntonioR> urgh, just when I got online he quits :(
[17:41] <jcastro> he hates you
[17:41] <jcastro> just kidding
[17:41] <jcastro> he probably doesn't
[17:42] <JoseeAntonioR> :P
[17:42] <JoseeAntonioR> jcastro: ubuntu on air canonical hosting almost fully set up, btw
[17:42] <jcastro> \o/
[17:47] <mhall119> jono: can you confirm that https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuPhone/CoreApps/Calendar looks good to you?  If so, I'll go and finish the rest
[17:55] <jono> mhall119, checking
[17:55] <jono> mhall119, perfect!\
[17:55] <jono> thanks :-)
[18:19] <bkerensa> mhall119: you have a N7 for Ubuntu right? You use a keyboard at all?
[18:20] <mhall119> bkerensa: a physical one? not unless I have to
[18:20] <mhall119> actually, I've never used a physical keyboard, used a physical mouse though
[18:20] <bkerensa> mhall119: k well I am giving away a N7 keyboard or two this week
[18:20] <bkerensa> BT even
[18:21] <mhall119> from a product review?
[18:22] <bkerensa> mhall119: yeah
[18:22] <mhall119> cool
[18:24] <jcastro> man so I discovered The Black Keys, awesome work music.
[18:24] <jcastro> snap-l: I require your approval ^^
[18:25] <snap-l> Not sure I can give it. I've never listened to 'em.
[18:26] <snap-l> But, I require your approval
[18:26] <snap-l> I bought the first Asia album yesterday.
[18:26] <jcastro> never disliked them
[18:26] <snap-l> Along with Rush: GUP remaster, and Led Zeppelin: Presence.
[18:27] <snap-l> Yeah, the Asia album is... dated. ;)
[18:27] <snap-l> I was expecting something a little more.
[18:27] <mhall119> jcastro: you just now discovered the black keys?
[18:27] <jcastro> yeah
[18:28] <mhall119> good band, a funky combination of rock & folk, but I like it
[18:29] <snap-l> jcastro: https://www.youtube.com/user/theblackkeys
[18:30] <snap-l> Yeah, I have no problem with this.
[18:30] <snap-l> Hell, this reminds me of the "alternative" stuff I loved in college.
[18:30] <jcastro> google music describes it as "garage blues"
[18:30] <jcastro> but whatever, it's just good
[18:30] <snap-l> Yeah, I don't get hung upo on those labels
[18:31]  * snap-l had an album of Kentucky Headhunters for a while.
[18:32] <jcastro> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2cB5Vkyuv4
[18:32] <jcastro> this is just a jam right here
[18:33] <mhall119> I think Tighten Up ws the first song I bought from U1 Music Store
[18:33] <snap-l> Reminds me of The White Stripes (just because it's a duo)
[18:34] <snap-l> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zQbXztf0kU
[18:35] <jcastro> yeah, I could never get into the white stripes
[18:35] <jcastro> then blam, they were gone
[18:36] <snap-l> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlkaxyYDBI8
[18:36] <snap-l> Second one is better sounding (isn't a time-capsule of bad VHS technology). ;)
[18:38] <JanC> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLCrgQ7DR44 ?  â˜º
[18:40] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: ready to go live in 20?
[18:41] <jono> JoseeAntonioR, yup
[18:41] <jono> mhall119, my blog is ready
[18:41] <jono> how are the wiki pages coming along?
[18:42] <snap-l> jcastro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM8V5mMGYas
[18:42] <snap-l> starts at :40
[18:43] <mhall119> jono: finishing the last of the wiki pages still
[18:43] <jono> mhall119, ok
[18:43] <jono> I will be publish just before I do my videocast
[18:44] <mhall119> jono: that's fine, the pages all exists already
[18:44] <jono> mhall119, I will publish
[18:46] <jono> mhall119, http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/01/23/community-driven-ubuntu-phone-core-apps/
[18:46] <jono> can someone reddit this for me ^
[18:47] <mhall119> on it
[18:47] <jono> JoseeAntonioR, grabbing a coffee and then will be back
[18:47] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: sure
[18:48] <mhall119> jono: http://www.reddit.com/r/Ubuntu/comments/174x0l/canonical_opens_core_ubuntu_phone_app_development/
[18:49] <jono> thanks mhall119
[18:50] <jcastro> hey, you guys know mybalsamiq runs on ...
[18:50] <jcastro> that's right baby, Ubuntu Server
[18:50] <jcastro> on the cloud
[18:53] <mhall119> jcastro: nice
[18:54] <doctormon> jcastro: Charmed?
[18:54] <jcastro> doubtful
[18:55] <JanC> if you want to listen to some great garage rock, try these Belgian kids[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZZaW2zwCo  [1] yes, they were still underage when they made this â˜º
[19:01] <jcastro> hey jono, when you post something on G+, can you explicitly share it to the "Ubuntu" community page? It should show up in the dropdown when you post.
[19:01] <jcastro> for things that might be interesting, like the core apps thing you just announced
[19:01] <jcastro> it's like another 35k people
[19:02] <JanC> BTW: will any of you be at FOSDEM?
[19:02] <JanC> or any of the Ubuntu Phone people?
[19:02] <popey> i dont think anyone from the phone team will be at uds
[19:03] <JanC> popey: you mean "at FOSDEM"?
[19:03] <popey> sorry, yes
[19:04] <JanC> well, how many of Ubuntu Phone is open source right now or will be in the near future?
[19:05] <popey> it all will be in the near future, but not before fosdem
[19:05] <JanC> I heard something about late February?
[19:05] <popey> i heard that too
[19:07] <JanC> anyway, I can distribute fliers about it at FOSDEM, provided I can be sure it will be open source soon, and provided somebody sends me a PDF for such a flyer that I can get printed  â˜º
[19:07] <JanC> same for other Ubuntu-related projects
[19:08] <popey> as I said, it's going to be open source soon
[19:08] <popey> I don't think we have any flyers
[19:10] <JanC> oh, and of course I mean mostly developer-targeted flyers (as it's a developer conference), so no marketing but something about how to contribute
[19:10] <JanC> (and maybe I can make a simple flyer if I get the most important text for it, but I have no time for anything more)
[19:14] <JanC> this also applies to other projects BTW (say, the people working on MAAS & Juju & what not)
[19:16] <mhall119> jono: wiki pages have all been updated now
[20:43] <JoseeAntonioR> popey: ping
[20:51] <JoseeAntonioR> jcastro: in case you have a minute, do you know how to get rid of the search bar that's on onair.ubuntu.com?
[20:59] <jcastro> no clue
[21:03] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: using the community theme?
[21:03] <pleia2> I did it for ubuntucalifornia.org, but I forget, might have even manually edited the theme
[21:03] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: yeppers
[21:03]  * pleia2 investigates
[21:03] <JoseeAntonioR> I also forgot how to, did it a long time ago with ubuntuonair.com
[21:04] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: under appearance > widgets perhaps?
[21:04] <pleia2> wp changed a lot since I did this :\
[21:05] <JoseeAntonioR> already done that, didn't fix it
[21:05] <JoseeAntonioR> I'm still in 3.4, though
[21:08] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: ok, appearance > menus and go down to "sub menu"
[21:08] <popey> JoseeAntonioR: replied
[21:09] <pleia2> is search an option there you can remove?
[21:09] <JoseeAntonioR> pleia2: I have no sub menu tab/section/sth
[21:10] <JoseeAntonioR> popey: great, thanks!
[21:10] <pleia2> JoseeAntonioR: hm, in that Menus page I have "Top menu" and "Sub menu" tabs
[21:10] <pleia2> maybe I haven't updated this theme in a while
[21:11] <JoseeAntonioR> I actually have no menu support in this menu, and am using the custom menu widget
[21:11] <pleia2> ah
[21:11] <JoseeAntonioR> the search widget was enabled and removed it, though it didn't fix it
[21:40] <jono> mhall119, hey
[21:40] <jono> any people asked to be added to mybalsamiq yet?
[21:41] <mhall119> jono: we've had a few, but I think balsamiq is screwing up and dropping them after they've been added, I sent dpm an email showing screenshots of what's happening
[21:41] <jono> mhall119, damn
[21:42] <jono> lets get this fixed as a priority
[21:43] <mhall119> I just have no idea what's happening or why, I see them listed as members one minute, the next minute they're gone
[21:43] <mhall119> it could be that they're removing themselves, but I don't know why they would
[21:44] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: have a minute?
[21:44] <jono> JoseeAntonioR, sure
[21:44] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: think you can please login into onair.ubuntu.com/login to check if openid's getting any problems?
[21:45] <jono> JoseeAntonioR, it keeps redirecting back to the login button
[21:45] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: great, thanks
[21:45] <jono> np
[21:46] <jono> mhall119, does Kevin know he needs to get the template project finalized for each app?
[21:46] <mhall119> jono: we should only need one template
[21:46] <jono> mhall119, right
[21:46] <jono> but then put in each branch
[21:47] <mhall119> and just push that to each project's trunk
[21:47] <mhall119> yes
[21:47] <jono> I am just reading this thread about the app wrapper
[21:47] <jono> I will follow up
[21:47] <mhall119> jono: I'm fairly sure he understands
[21:50] <jono> mhall119, cool
[21:50] <jono> I just responded to the thread
[22:18] <popey> JoseeAntonioR: http 500 on ubuntuonair.com
[22:19] <JoseeAntonioR> popey: yep, we're working with deej to get this right, it's getting crazy when set to ubuntuonair.com
[22:20] <JoseeAntonioR> but onair.ubuntu.com works fine
[22:20] <JoseeAntonioR> can you please try logging into onair.u.com?
[22:34] <popey> JoseeAntonioR: i get redirected after login to http://ubuntuonair.com/Array
[22:34] <popey> "Apologies, but we were unable to find what you were looking for. Perhaps searching will help.
[22:34] <popey> "
[22:35] <popey> but I am logged in
[22:35] <mhall119> oh oh oh, I've seen that before
[22:35] <popey> looks better
[22:35] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: make sure it's using the newest version of the WP plugin for LP teams mapping
[22:35] <popey> the site works too
[22:35] <popey> looks good
[22:35] <mhall119> newz2000 and I fixed that over a year ago
[22:36] <JoseeAntonioR> mhall119: it's the latest version, there's a ticket to get that fixed
[22:37] <JoseeAntonioR> then, we've got everything set up in canonical hosting now!
[22:37] <JoseeAntonioR> we only need to get that search bar removed
[22:41] <popey> I have no rights to do anything once logged in..
[22:42] <mhall119> popey: they don't trust you
[22:42] <mhall119> worried about it being shut down ;)
[22:42] <JoseeAntonioR> oh right, I need to manually set each user as admin
[22:42] <jcastro> jono: http://i.stack.imgur.com/EVQw9.gif
[22:43] <SergioMeneses> hi all!
[22:43] <mhall119> jcastro: that's hysterical
[22:43] <jcastro> avenge me!
[22:43] <SergioMeneses> jcastro, jaja
[22:49] <popey> mhall119: wise
=== toddyhb is now known as toddy
[23:00] <jono> jcastro, lol
[23:05] <aquarius> "avenge me" should become some sort of new meme thing :)
[23:06] <jcastro> yeah
[23:07] <jcastro> "I broke the build, avenge me."
[23:07] <jcastro> "My SRU was declined, avenge me."
[23:07] <jcastro> https://github.com/blog/1381-a-whole-new-code-search
[23:07] <jcastro> blam! more elasticsearch
[23:07] <jcastro> it's everywhere
[23:09] <aquarius> also, http://devslovebacon.com/ -- submit a talk!
[23:09] <popey> oooh
[23:09] <popey> also, bacon
[23:10] <popey> 300 notes!
[23:10] <popey> aquarius: you going?
[23:10] <aquarius> nope
[23:10] <aquarius> was just amused by the name :)
[23:11] <aquarius> room full of people who would never dream of owning anything other than a Mac, that. :)
[23:12] <popey> you could submit a talk!
[23:13] <aquarius> I could, and I thought about it, but I couldn't think of anything immediately
[23:14] <aquarius> popey, also, just used uupc in a tiny demo :)
[23:15] <bkerensa> jcastro: wish lp had some features github had like web code editing :) and elastic search would be nice too
[23:16] <popey> uhoh
[23:20] <czajkowski> bkerensa: more than welcome to file a bug there ;)
[23:21] <bkerensa> czajkowski: aye
[23:25] <popey> hah
[23:25] <popey> ignored like all the other lp bugs â˜º
[23:25] <pleia2> I think the party line here is "patches welcome" :)
[23:25] <popey> oh yes, that
[23:26] <czajkowski> well they are :)
[23:26] <czajkowski> there isn't development going on at present
[23:26] <czajkowski> so you can request al the new features but they wont be implemented for some time unless patches are submitted
[23:27] <czajkowski> just  a simple fact
