[22:15] <erupter> hi guys. I'd like to learn how to setup a ppa. I've been reading on launchpad, but the steps and what goes where is still quite not clear. are there any ppa-for-the-idiots docs out there?
[22:16] <micahg> erupter: https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/
[22:17] <erupter> yeah exactly where I am right now
[22:17] <erupter> still I don't understand how it works
[22:17] <erupter> what should I do. I mean: do packages get compiled on the fly when downloaded?
[22:20] <micahg> no, they build in the PPA
[22:20] <erupter> so when you download you download pre-compiled binaries...
[22:20] <erupter> ok
