[08:48] <zendox> hello
[20:29] <zendox> hey grant nice so are u going to the dev summit?
[20:30] <grantbow> hi zendox
[20:30] <grantbow> everyone can attend online
[20:30] <grantbow> I will be there physically since Oakland is on the BART line and relatively easy to get to from anywhere in the SF Bay Area.
[20:30] <zendox> what channel
[20:31] <zendox> will it be online
[20:31] <grantbow> yes, lots are online from last time and there are ways to participate from anywhere. Briefly it goes like this...
[20:31] <grantbow> each room has an IRC channel and a live audio feed.
[20:31] <zendox> nice
[20:32] <grantbow> so you can type in the channel and it will appear on the screen in the room
[20:32] <grantbow> remote people can't see the slides but it's a good way to participate
[20:32] <grantbow> in the rooms are two projection screens - one for IRC, one for slides
[20:32] <grantbow> they use etherpad lite for not taking too
[20:33] <grantbow> so the slides are often the etherpad lite notes
[20:33] <grantbow> there are multiple write-ups describing this setup and I can find them for you and anyone else who wants to participate
[20:33] <grantbow> I have sent them to the ubuntu-us-ca email list before
[20:33] <zendox> oh
[20:34] <grantbow> feel free to subscribe to the California Local Community email list :-)
[20:34] <zendox> you know i think the audio streams is better
[20:34] <zendox> i shall do that
[20:34] <grantbow> indeed, but they are not until May 6-9.
[20:34] <grantbow> there are also youtube videos of past sessions
[20:35] <grantbow> some of the working sessions and all the keynotes go into youtube at...
[20:35] <zendox> wait aren't the audio streams live?
[20:36] <grantbow> http://www.youtube.com/user/ubuntudevelopers
[20:36] <grantbow> the youtube postings are delayed
[20:36] <grantbow> the audio streams are live
[20:36] <grantbow> it takes awhile to edit the video
[20:37] <grantbow> though the keynotes get posted quickly on the first day
[20:37] <grantbow> I gave a talk in May, 2012 that is online at UDS in that youtube channel :-)
[20:37] <zendox> thats cool
[20:38] <zendox> whats the  link to your talk
[20:38] <grantbow> the others in the channel are more interesting often. I'll find the link.
[20:39] <zendox> ok
[20:43] <grantbow> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAU0iUM_aQU
[20:44] <grantbow> I start speaking about 12 minutes in
[20:45] <grantbow> actually 13
[20:51] <grantbow> through 18 minutes
[20:51] <grantbow> five minutes is not a lot of time
[20:51] <grantbow> any I should have given that talk to a different audience
[20:53] <grantbow> s/any/and/
[20:53] <grantbow> so how is mfarm going zendox?
[20:55] <grantbow> have there been any more Ubuntu Hours formally or informally at ihub?
[21:06] <zendox> not really they kind of died out when you went out
[21:06] <zendox> mfarm
[21:06] <zendox> haven't checked up on them for  a while
[21:06] <zendox> hanging with bernard now
[21:33] <grantbow> really? How is my fellow Mentor doing? Say hello from me!
[21:38] <grantbow> you are still on here, right? http://mfarm.co.ke/team
