[10:03] <me4oslav> davidcalle andyrock - is there a way to disable a lens w/out removing the package or deleting the .lens file
[10:04] <davidcalle> me4oslav, you can move the /usr/share/unity/lenses/<lens> folder. I use a /usr/share/unity/lenses/backup to store these, which makes things quite handy.
[10:06] <me4oslav> that's one obvious solution, however I was thinking more of a gsettings way to do it. I am fine w/ moving stuff, just not sure if mechanig will make it in the USC w/ such code ;p
[10:07] <davidcalle> me4oslav, oh right, it's for Mechanig... Hmm, that's currently the only way. Raring will maybe have gsettings for lenses, but that's not sure.

[14:53] <attj> Hi, i wanted to connect my ubuntu to playstation 3 so i installed PS3 Media Server. However the software doesn't launch as a startup but i knew there is an option top-right corner for that.
[14:54] <attj> But i could i add that?
[14:54] <attj> Ok, my best and only guess was to click "add" and write "usr/bin/psmediaserver" which was correct way to do it and now software startup with no problem, nice.
[14:55] <attj> Still if i think about average computer users, John and Marie, who are not so familiar with terminal commands, this is quite compilicate way. i didn't figure this out myself easily... :(
[14:55] <attj> So there are icons as super-button is pressed and softwares are found by typing a name. Could it be possible to right click icon which drops you options (like normal behaviour with files and folders) and there could be found "launch software as startup"?
[14:56] <attj> As ubuntu is moving with a good speed toward touchscreen, this maybe also quite simple way to execute on pads?
[14:58] <attj> just a thought, how ubuntu and unity user friendly could increase
[14:59] <Zhenech> not having a ubuntu in front of me, but there should be something like this if you type "start" into dash :)
[15:01] <luv> Zhenech: yeah, works :-)
[15:02] <Zhenech> what is it called in english?
[15:02] <luv> Startup Applications :-)
[15:02] <Zhenech> google told me startprogramme on german locale, but that does not scale :)
[15:02] <Zhenech> ah, ok
