[06:14] <mvt007geek> hi
[06:16] <mvt007geek> i am trying to install ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-desktop-armel+omap4 on panda board. but i see nothing in monitor. someone told me it's because of ubuntu-11.10-preinstalled-desktop-armel+omap4 .is it true? should i use newer versions???
[06:35] <mvt007geek> no answer dears?
[06:36] <XorA> europe is still asleep
[06:42] <infinity> mvt007geek: (a) you should use 12.04/armhf, ideally.
[06:43] <infinity> mvt007geek: (b) it could just be that you're using the wrong DVI/HDMI port.
[06:44] <infinity> mvt007geek: http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/12.04/release/ <-- For the omap4/armhf 12.04 images.
[06:46] <mvt007geek> infinity: no i checked it.also i changed port so many times.but still not working. and currently i'm downloading it to see what eill happend next :) by the way because of slow internet speed till 2 hour is better to work on ubuntu11.10 :D
[07:02] <mvt007geek> i want to configure minicom .http://omappedia.org/wiki/PandaBoard_Ubuntu_How-tos#Install_and_Setup_Minicom    i don't know how find the right usb port. can someone help me?
[07:05] <erdnussradio> take a look at output of dmesg perhaps you can find more information there.
[07:06] <mvt007geek> http://paste.debian.net/226310/
[07:06] <mvt007geek> erdnussradio: http://paste.debian.net/226310/
[07:06] <mvt007geek> it's confusing
[07:08] <erdnussradio> mvt007geek: what are you trying? ttyS0 looks like a serial console
[07:08] <mvt007geek> http://paste.debian.net/226311/
[07:11] <erdnussradio> where is the problem? What do you want to do? Use a usb-serial adapter or what do you want to do with minicom?
[07:13] <mvt007geek> i connected pandaboard to a pc(serial port) to check it with minicom
[07:13] <erdnussradio> ok. then try to use ttyS0
[07:14] <erdnussradio> but perhaps it would be easierto use ssh via eth but its your choice ;)
[07:15] <mvt007geek> http://paste.debian.net/226323/
[07:16] <mvt007geek> erdnussradio: pandaboard monitor don't work.that's the reason i want to use minicom.i want to check what is the problem. so there is no ubuntu on panda to ssh to
[07:18] <erdnussradio> ok. then try picocom /dev/ttyS0
[07:18] <erdnussradio> cant find how to do that in minicom sry

[07:20] <erdnussradio> but usually its neccessary to also hand over the baud rate. But i dont know what the baud rate of your panda board is.
[07:21] <erdnussradio> google says 115200
[07:28] <mvt007geek> erdnussradio: i installed picocom .but don't know anything about it :D
[07:28] <erdnussradio> mvt007geek: man picocom
[07:29] <erdnussradio> mvt007geek: 'picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyS0' should work
[07:30] <mvt007geek> erdnussradio:  yes. yes.it works :)
[07:30] <erdnussradio> :)
[07:31] <mvt007geek> http://paste.debian.net/226327/
[07:35] <mvt007geek> but what should i do now?should i write anything in terminal ?because it show nothing to me!!i turned on and off pandaboard but nothing
[07:51] <mvt007geek> erdnussradio: i decided to change baudrate .cause when i turn panda on and off picocom shows nothing to me :( but what are the baudrate i can give to it?
[07:53] <erdnussradio> dont know. i dont know panda board and i dont know much about serial connections
[13:21] <sim590> Anyone has got the sound working on the TF101 under ubuntu?

[15:27] <Aartsie> hi all
[15:29] <Aartsie> i have seen the topic but is it possible to install ubuntu arm on a pi ?
[15:30] <lilstevie> no, that is why it is in the topic
[15:31] <Aartsie> ok :) are the ubuntu developers busy on it ? or it should never work ?
[15:32] <lilstevie> no
[15:36] <infinity> Aartsie: It'll never work because the Pi is armv6, and we target >= armv7
[15:36] <infinity> Aartsie: Debian armel is armv4 (so that works), and there's also an unofficial Debian port called "Raspbian" that's armv6/hard-float.
[15:37] <infinity> Aartsie: The latter (Raspbian) as actually what the Pi guys tend to recommend these days, I believe, so you might want to give it a go.
[15:37] <infinity> Aartsie: And, trust me, you don't want to be running a full Ubuntu desktop on a Pi, so you're not really missing out (they're sloooow).
[15:38] <Aartsie> hmmm ok to bad

[15:41] <infinity> Hrm, I suppose I should switch the order of those too.

[15:42] <lilstevie> heh
[15:42] <lilstevie> Aartsie: ubuntu would really be painful on the rpi
[15:42] <infinity> Yeah.
[15:43] <infinity> The "Ubuntu" that I would run on a Pi (if I could), would be seriously cut down, with a really lightweight WM (or no WM at all).
[15:43] <lilstevie> 512MB ram is barely enough, I'd hate to imagine it with 256MBN
[15:43] <lilstevie> -N
[15:43] <infinity> At which point, I've ventured into the realm of "software that Ubuntu doesn't modify".
[15:43] <infinity> And you've got... *drum roll*... Debian.
[15:43] <lilstevie> infinity: yeah, headless server would be the only way
[15:43] <lilstevie> infinity: but even then its worth would be questionable
[15:44] <infinity> lilstevie: Headless might be alright.  Even my crap little Beagle C4 is vaguely usable headless.
[15:44] <lilstevie> until you give it some work to do
[15:44] <infinity> lilstevie: I hear the Pi's got pretty spiffy graphics, though (disproportionately so, compared to the CPU), so a super lightweight WM, or just a raw X with a video player on the root window might work quite well.
[15:45] <lilstevie> infinity: yeah
[15:46] <lilstevie> infinity: I have a roku 2 XS which has the same SoC
[15:46] <lilstevie> it is brilliant for media
[15:47] <infinity> My guess is that Raspbian booting directly to xbmc as the session manager might be alright.
[15:48] <infinity> Assuming you pick a theme that isn't crazy CPU intensive for no good reason.
[15:48] <lilstevie> yeah
[15:49] <lilstevie> it really is a shame cause it has one of the best h.264 decoders I have seen on an arm SoC
[15:54] <infinity> I wonder what the SoC is in my Samsung TV.  I've yet to throw anything at it that makes it upset.
[15:55] <lilstevie> infinity: they are all samsung SoCs
[15:56] <lilstevie> infinity: what series? (Ax, Bx, Cx, Dx, Ex)
[15:56] <lilstevie> cause they are not quite all samsung actually
[15:56] <lilstevie> C5xxx and D5xxx also come in mips
[15:57] <infinity> It's a Uxxx8000
[15:57] <infinity> Looks like a Samsung SDP1106, whatever that is.
[15:57] <lilstevie> D or E?
[15:57] <infinity> I'd have to go downstairs and look, and I'm far too lazy. :)
[15:57] <lilstevie> heh
[15:58] <lilstevie> 2011 or 2012
[15:58] <lilstevie> (thats all the letter refers to :p)
[15:58] <infinity> Bought it last year, not sure when it was manufactured.
[15:58] <lilstevie> fair enough
[15:59] <XorA|gone> hey lilstevie I got myself a tf700t whats the native linux expeience like on those beasties?
[15:59] <infinity> I didn't buy it to hack on, just to watch stuff, so I've not really dug into specs.
[15:59] <lilstevie> either way it will be similar to hummingbird (Exynos3) or Exynos4
[15:59] <lilstevie> XorA|gone: no idea, haven't done it with the tf700 cause I don't have one
[16:00] <lilstevie> can't imagine it being much different to the tf201 though except with better resolution
[16:00] <lilstevie> which is pretty decent
[16:00] <XorA|gone> lilstevie: was my figuring as well
[16:00] <lilstevie> XorA|gone: the only thing is you will need to build a kernel for it
[16:00] <lilstevie> tf700 at present is the only device incompatible with the kernel on my repo
[16:01] <lilstevie> it *may* work, but with issue
[16:01] <lilstevie> +s
[16:01] <XorA|gone> hehe
[16:01] <XorA|gone> I need to decide whether to unlock boot loader first
[16:01] <lilstevie> cause tf201 and tf300 are very similar
[16:01] <infinity> Is the answer to that question ever "no"?
[16:01] <RaYmAn> is it running jb or ics?
[16:01] <infinity> Unlock early, unlock often.
[16:01] <RaYmAn> if it's ics, unlock and do nvflash procedure =P
[16:01] <lilstevie> heh that is also a good question
[16:02] <XorA|gone> RaYmAn: it is not ICS, but it can be again ;-)
[16:02] <lilstevie> XorA|gone: nope it can't be :p
[16:02] <lilstevie> well not to a level that matters
[16:03] <lilstevie> there is only one ICS firmware you can downgrade to, but that has the vulnerability closed
[16:06] <XorA|gone> looks like on tf700t nvflash coudlnt unbrick even if you did the trick
[16:06] <XorA|gone> so I didn't lose anything
[16:06] <RaYmAn> uhm
[16:06] <RaYmAn> it can unbrick from anything
[16:06] <lilstevie> except hardware damage
[16:06] <RaYmAn> of course :P
[16:07] <XorA|gone> RaYmAn: not according to its page it cant
[16:07] <RaYmAn> XorA|gone: then whatever page you are looking at is wrong.
[16:07] <lilstevie> XorA|gone: seems kinda odd if it doesn't work
[16:07] <RaYmAn> lilstevie: we should probably put a list of members on the androidroot.mobi page at some point ;)
[16:08] <lilstevie> RaYmAn: probably a good idea :p
[16:09] <XorA|gone> RaYmAn: its the androidroot.mobi page that says that
[16:09] <RaYmAn> XorA|gone: uhm, no. Where?
[16:09] <XorA|gone> http://androidroot.mobi/2012/09/23/nvflash-for-tegra3-transformer-tf700t/
[16:10] <lilstevie> XorA|gone: oh I see what you did there
[16:10] <RaYmAn> you're misreading it
[16:10] <lilstevie> XorA|gone: you must run the procedure on a working device
[16:10] <RaYmAn> indeed
[16:10] <XorA|gone> it needs re-worded than :-)
[16:10] <lilstevie> once you are bricked you cant run the procedure
[16:11] <XorA|gone> bah, had I not read that first I would have done it
[16:11] <RaYmAn> you're the first person I've heard of who misunderstood that part =P
[16:19] <XorA|gone> ah well too late now, will wait until I get a tf900 :-D
[16:19] <lilstevie> lol
[16:22] <XorA|gone> chances are Ill never get a chance to brick the 700 anyway, always too busing debugging tablets for work :-)
[16:23] <lilstevie> we cannot guarantee that asus will not brick it for you
[16:23] <XorA|gone> then its under waranty :-D
[16:25] <lilstevie> are you in the us?
[16:25] <XorA|gone> currently in US but I like in UK
[16:25] <XorA|gone> live
[16:25] <lilstevie> heh
[16:26] <XorA|gone> anyway time to head to meet friends
[16:26] <lilstevie> later
