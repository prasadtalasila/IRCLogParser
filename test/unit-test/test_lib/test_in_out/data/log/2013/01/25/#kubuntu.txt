[07:22] <ovidiu-florin> hello world, I have a printer that I could install with no problem in Kubuntu 12.04 and cannot install in 12.10. I have the exact same settings and it does not work anymore.
=== sysadmin__ is now known as VlanX
[07:32] <ovidiu-florin> why does the checkbox Reject Pring Jobs Exist? and most importantly why is it checked by default?
[07:34] <gnomefreak> ovidiu-florin: what printer?
[07:34] <gnomefreak> maybe we dont support it anymore
[07:36] <ovidiu-florin> A toshiba E-Studio 250
[07:36] <ovidiu-florin> but I use the driver for 205 and it mostly works
[07:37] <ovidiu-florin> I got it working after I unchecked the Reject Printing Jobs option

[14:11] <geri> i dont need support :D
[14:11] <geri> office, browing, printing :D
[14:12] <geri> thats what this computer is used for
[14:15] <BluesKaj> geri support is free , in terms of software updates / upgrades etc ...ok what model printer ? if it's lexmark you might have some trouble with drivers for home printers , lexmark commercial office printers are mostly supported

[15:28] <Graf_Westerholt> Sometimes a Window or menu in KDE is black. What is the problem?
[15:30] <contrast> Graf_Westerholt: Haven't seen that in a long time. What version of KDE are you using?
[15:30] <Graf_Westerholt> KDE 4.9.5
[15:31] <contrast> Weird... What graphics card, and are your drivers up to date?
[15:31] <MichaelP> Anyone useing 4.10 yet
[15:32] <Graf_Westerholt> Nvidia GeForce 9300 GE, nvidia-driver 304.43
[15:34] <contrast> I am, MichaelP
[15:35] <contrast> Graf_Westerholt: Sorry, not sure what else it would be. Is it happening a lot, or only with certain programs?
[15:36] <Graf_Westerholt> a lot. All programs.
[15:37] <contrast> Graf_Westerholt: The only thing I could suggest is turning off Desktop Effects. That should definitely take care of it, but if that's too drastic, you could try changing some of the settings.
[15:38] <Graf_Westerholt> ok
[15:38] <contrast> Graf_Westerholt: Is this occuring on a clean ~/.kde?
[15:39] <contrast> Or just the one you've been using for however long?
[15:39] <Graf_Westerholt> I do not know, my KDE is from 1745.
[15:39] <contrast> 1745?
[15:39] <Graf_Westerholt> Sure. :) I am old. ;)
[15:39] <Graf_Westerholt> It is my „using KDE“.
[15:40] <contrast> Ahh, well yeah, try creating a new user and see if it persists there. I generally start with a clean $HOME/.kde folder for every feature release, so as to avoid bugs and cruft.
[15:41] <Graf_Westerholt> Mm, I like to keep my settings. ;)
[15:43] <contrast> Graf_Westerholt: Ok, but in order to troubleshoot, you should try creating a new user.... Try disabling blur first though, looks like that *could* be causing it - https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=188662
[15:43] <ubottu> KDE bug 188662 in general "Black windows with compositing" [Normal,Resolved: upstream]
[15:43] <contrast> It's an older bug report, but it checks out.
[15:44] <Graf_Westerholt> It is different from my bug. It can happen when I resize a window.
[15:45] <devmark> is it hard to setup openvpn for kubuntu?
[15:45] <devmark> i already did apt-get install openvpn
[15:45] <contrast> Graf_Westerholt: Alright, man. Do what you like. If you're unwilling to try anything that I suggest to you, I'm not sure why you're asking for help. ^_~
[15:53] <MichaelP> contrast, is it kde 4.10 or did panel change style color in the past with different qtcurve styles and colors
[15:54] <contrast> MichaelP: The Air theme for Plasma got a pretty heavy makeover, if that's what you're referring to?
[15:55] <contrast> MichaelP: QtCurve's *style* shouldn't have any impact on it, but I know certain Plasma themes do adhere to the current color scheme. Not sure whether that was newly implemented in Air or not though.
[15:56] <MichaelP> contrast, what ever it is.. I like it.. Makes for a cleaner look
[15:56] <contrast> Indeed
[15:56] <contrast> MichaelP: Have you noticed the new bug with closing notifications?
[15:58] <MichaelP> Not yet... i had at frist to reboot i had to hit the power button... cause restart did not work for the 1st day
[15:59] <MichaelP> plus im useing the ppa main line kernel 3.6.3-030603-generic x86_64
[16:00] <contrast> MichaelP: https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=311413 -- Feel free to vote on that. It's the only really noticeable regression I've seen in 4.10 so far.
[16:00] <ubottu> KDE bug 311413 in notifications "X on notification popup does not dismiss notification" [Normal,Unconfirmed]
[16:02] <MichaelP> contrast, i guess i have noticed that... when i copy and paste something from harddrive to usb drive... i have to close the the notication thing that shows the percentage of the transfer by hand
[16:04] <MichaelP> That says 4.9.90 im on 4.9.98
[16:05] <contrast> Yeah, it still occurs in 4.9.98
[16:05] <MichaelP> is it what i said above about having to close by hand
[16:07] <MichaelP> we just about about 3 inch's of snow the last few hours
[16:07] <contrast> I'm not sure what you mean... I always had to close "file transfer complete" notifications manually (all through the 4.9 series). This is referring to how, if you click the close button on a notification *as soon* as it pops up, it will just dismiss the notification without actually closing it, then you have to click the notification icon in the system tray and close the notification from there.
[16:10] <MichaelP> Ohh so like error report notifications.. clicking close just minamizes it
[16:10] <contrast> Right
[16:11] <MichaelP> Ok.. I have not had any error reports.. sence i 1st installed kubuntu... VLC was giving for awhile..
[16:12] <contrast> bleh... SMPlayer >>> VLC. :P
[16:13] <contrast> I mean, unless you're one of the few people that actually uses VLC for its namesake (streaming video over a LAN).
[16:16] <MichaelP> I don't like smplayer... it don't go straight to next video...
[16:21] <MichaelP> im having trouble getting smplayer to play my video directory.. plays 1 video then stops

[17:11] <jaafar> hi guys.  I am trying to properly build and test an updated version of the plasma networkmanagement widget that is supposed to fix some bugs I am experiencing (see KDE bugs 312963 and 312964).  I'm not sure I am following the correct procedure to build and replace the widget for testing.

[17:12] <jaafar> my procedure is untar,mkdir build,cd build,cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`kde4-config --prefix` ..;make;sudo apt-get remove plasma-widget-networkmanagement;sudo make install
[17:12] <jaafar> have I missed anything?
[17:12] <jaafar> and is anyone else frustrated by the plasma network widget?
[17:13] <jaafar> I'm embarrassed to say I am just using the Gnome one instead... seems silly to have to do that

[23:01] <pedro> Hey everyone? could someone help me with some permissions stuff?
=== pedro is now known as pedro142
[23:02] <pedro142> Is someone there?
[23:02] <pedro142> I have a problem with permissions which doesn't allow me to do much
[23:04] <yofel> !anyone | pedro142
[23:04] <ubottu> pedro142: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[23:05] <pedro142> You see I was learning the first steps on terminal use, and trying to use the command "mkdir"
[23:05] <pedro142> it seems I dont have permission
[23:05] <pedro142> but this is my computer, and I am logged in as the admin
[23:06] <yofel> admin meaning yourself or root?
[23:06] <pedro142> Administrator.
[23:06] <pedro142> myself
[23:06] <yofel> usually you have write permissions in /home/<username>/ and some other locations like /tmp
[23:06] <pedro142> I can though if I type sudo before
[23:06] <yofel> right
[23:07] <pedro142> this is normal? for example:
[23:07] <pedro142> cd ~/Desktop
[23:07] <pedro142> mkdir /Folder
[23:07] <pedro142> it gives me a permission denied error
[23:07] <yofel> wait, watch out
[23:07] <yofel> the / at the beginning means you're providing a full path
[23:07] <yofel> and /Folder != ~/Desktop/Folder
[23:08] <yofel> just run mkdir Folder and it will work
[23:08] <yofel> what you did was try to create Folder in /
[23:08] <pedro142> but I want to create the Folder directory on my desktop, not on root.
[23:08] <yofel> right, so just leave the / away
[23:08] <pedro142> AH it worked !
[23:08] <pedro142> thanks!
[23:09] <yofel> !cmd
[23:09] <yofel> hm...
[23:09] <yofel> !cli
[23:09] <pedro142> so of course it would not let me create a whole new branch!
[23:09] <ubottu> The linux terminal or command-line interface is very powerful. Open a terminal via Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal (Gnome) or K-menu -> System -> Konsole (KDE).  Guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal or type in it: man intro
[23:09] <yofel> now
[23:09] <yofel> pedro142: sudo mkdir /Folder would work - as that will run mkdir as "root" user which has write permissions everywhere
[23:10] <yofel> be very careful with sudo in the system folders...
[23:10] <pedro142> If I used: sudo mkdir /Folder  would it creat a whole new branch of directories because of the " / "?
[23:11] <yofel> not sure what you mean with branch, but yeah, it'll create the folder in the top level
[23:12] <pedro142> but I was in /home/<user>/Desktop
[23:13] <yofel> ah, note that 'cd ~/Desktop; mkdir Folder' and 'mkdir /home/$USER/Desktop/Folder' will do the same thing
[23:14] <yofel> first is create directory in current directory, second is with full path
[23:14] <yofel> if you begin with / the programs will assume that you're starting the path from the toplevel
[23:16] <pedro142> ah ok! thanks! Thats why I couldn't.
[23:17] <yofel> another way to say "current directory" would be 'mkdir ./Folder", as "." is the current directory
[23:17] <yofel> ".." is the one before that
[23:17] <pedro142> Yes I am currently on Ubuntu's site learning all that!
[23:18] <pedro142> still for a "Windows" user, this kind of OS can be really intimidating in some aspects
[23:18] <yofel> well, it takes a while to get used to it
[23:18] <pedro142> although, in this first 2 days that I am using, the feel it gives is something extraordinary
[23:18] <yofel> C: missing doesn't help :P
[23:20] <pedro142> its kinda sad that it does not have the marketshare of other OS's.
[23:21] <pedro142> one more thing, I can't get to make file extensions to appear on the terminal
[23:21] <pedro142> like doc.txt
[23:22] <yofel> if the file has an extension, 'ls' will show it
[23:22] <yofel> linux doesn't really require file extensions though
[23:23] <yofel> so a file being named "text", is fine
[23:23] <yofel> it helps humans though ;)
[23:23] <pedro142> no, ls does not shoe it
[23:24] <pedro142> *show
[23:24] <yofel> then it shouldn't have an extension
[23:25] <pedro142> ok! Thanks, you've helped a lot!
