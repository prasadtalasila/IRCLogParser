[17:29] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 1102492 in Ubuntu "In Gedit (with Compiz), <Super>+scroll both scrolls the window and changes window opacity" [Undecided,New]
[17:29] <TheLordOfTime> so is this a bug in gedit, in compiz, or something else?
[17:29]  * TheLordOfTime is trying to assign it to a package :P
[17:39] <TheLordOfTime> anyone on the bugsquad mind if we either retire or redo the how-to-triage flowcharts?  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bugs/HowToTriage/Charts
[17:40] <TheLordOfTime> there seems to be confusion via these flowcharts when it comes to going from incomplete to otherstatus when the bug poster provides information
[17:40] <TheLordOfTime> (whereas it shoudl go from incomplete -> new when the bug poster provides new information)
[17:43] <TheLordOfTime> (some newer users are using them as a basis for status processing rather than reading the triage guide in depth.
[18:14] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: it is time to either update, or retire, it

[20:05] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, with enough time i can hash something together in Visio and export it as jpg.
[20:05] <TheLordOfTime> but i think the flowcharts'll need redone if bugcontrol decides to redo bug triage policy.
[20:05] <TheLordOfTime> so it may be best to temporarily retire that page until triage is decided on
[20:37] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: ack
[23:31] <fm__> can anybody comment on http://askubuntu.com/questions/245875/how-do-i-get-high-resolution-icons-in-unity-for-my-application-without-a-deskto ?
