[00:00] <goddard> dem0n: hey why do you like ruby?
[00:00] <dem0n> goddard: this all happened when i was upgrading from ruby1.8 to ruby1.9
[00:00] <dem0n> ruby is a great language
[00:01] <iceroot> caiotarifa: in the ubuntu repos for example on 12.04 there is version 1.x of a program. that version will only get security updates, so that you get 1.0-2 for example which will only fix security updates, you will never (there are some exceptions like firefox, thunderbird, flash) get a newer version then 1.x, so you will never see version 2.x in the repos
[00:01] <goddard> dem0n: ruby is extremely slow and python is the scripting language of choice and is fast
[00:01] <kunji> Ruby dependencies are god-awful
[00:01] <mladoux> goddard where do you get that from?
[00:01] <BAT-21> I just got an ircd running on my desktop. I can connect via XChat using localhost. What is the next step? I'm sure I need port forwarding but don't know where to go next. Any help is appreciated. Please?
[00:01] <caiotarifa> iceroot: So… I'll install everything with aptitude? And I should not continue my project to install the latest versions?
[00:01] <kunji> I find Python kind meh, but I know a lot of other people that like it
[00:02] <caiotarifa> iceroot: Is it the best way?
[00:02] <iceroot> caiotarifa: 1. you should not use aptitude when you have a amd64 system
[00:02] <mladoux> bad code is slow, usually not a fault of the language.
[00:02] <iceroot> !aptitude | caiotarifa
[00:02] <ubottu> caiotarifa: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[00:02] <goddard> mladoux: it is a well known fact
[00:02] <KxTwo> dpkg -S /usr/share/xsessions/FILL_THIS_PART_IN
[00:02] <mladoux> goddard: not one I've experienced, since i code in ruby
[00:02] <iceroot> caiotarifa: 2. you should only install software from the repos and not from other sources
[00:02] <goddard> mladoux: if you are always on ruby sites no one is going to say ruby is horrible
[00:03] <KxTwo> some one posted that earlier, can I remove everything but ubuntu and ubuntu-2d?
[00:03] <BAT-21> I need someone to check out my irc server but need help with port forwarding. . .please.
[00:03] <hangdeadman> How can I Root my lg optimus v using ubuntu 12.04?
[00:03] <iceroot> hangdeadman: #android
[00:03] <mladoux> goddard sure they do, they just usually don't back them up with actual statistics or quantifiable tests
[00:03] <friskd> of waiting servers which would essentially  receive this new payload, do some work which could take up to 30 seconds. Then return a JSON value back to the (Master Server) and then of course be returned to the original requestor.  What technologies are out there to help me do this so it scales well.
[00:03] <goddard> mladoux: just google it
[00:03] <hangdeadman> iceroot: thanks
[00:03] <iceroot> BAT-21: you should have a look at the manual for your router how to do port forwarding
[00:03] <goddard> mladoux: its not a mystery
[00:03] <BAT-21> thanks iceroot
[00:04] <BAT-21> after that I will share links for people to try it out.
[00:04] <mladoux> goddard I'm happy with ruby, it runs fast on every system I've run it on, and I've no reason to do python, so I don't see why the burden of proof should be on me.
[00:04] <goddard> mladoux: for the desktop and web python is the fastest then php then ruby
[00:04] <mladoux> anyway, i'm dropping this.
[00:04] <mladoux> I've got work to do.
[00:05] <ActionParsnip> hangdeadman: copy the files to the SD card from Ubuntu and then use the reboot + hold keys to get the console as usual
[00:05] <caiotarifa> iceroot: hen, ok, I think I'll rethink my idea.
[00:05] <goddard> mladoux: me to and I am using python/php to do it
[00:06] <iceroot> caiotarifa: and normally you cant provide a installer for all distros for a specific program, because each distro is doing it a little bit different (different paths, some are using sys v init, some upstart, some systemd)
[00:06] <goddard> mladoux: im actually at work right now :D
[00:06] <iceroot> caiotarifa: there are so mayn differences in the distros
[00:06] <kunji> ... scripting languages...
[00:07] <goddard> kunji: scripting languages are great
[00:08] <caiotarifa> iceroot: you're right
[00:08] <goddard> kunji: well some :D
[00:08] <kunji> goddard: Hmm, yes and no, I wouldn't say they're great for performance, at least in most cases
[00:08] <iceroot> caiotarifa: if you always want the newest software, there are distros for that case (debian sid, gentoo, arch for example), then there are distros where you will get major updates within a release which is still tested (sles for example), then there are distros where you will never see a major update within a release (debian (stable), ubuntu)
[00:09] <goddard> kunji: like what?
[00:09] <goddard> kunji: your network driver... well then of course
[00:09] <kunji> goddard: You mean what ones would I say are good, or bad?
[00:09] <iceroot> caiotarifa: and on webservers you always want ultra stable software, even ubuntu is (in my opionion) not ultra stable because the software is new, you want something like debian stable on a webserver where the software is tested over years
[00:09] <goddard> sure
[00:09] <kunji> goddard: or use cases?
[00:10] <iceroot> caiotarifa: but on a desktop, ultra stable is to old, there you want newer software like the newest libreoffice for better ms office integration, the newest firefox and so on and there comes for example ubuntu instead of debian stable (in my opinion)
[00:11] <kunji> Generally I like Matlab for things I need performance for, I haven't really assessed performance for most of the others, but I like coding with php, python performance has seemed pretty good, javascript performance has gotten a lot better recently but it still isn't good (but I still like coding with it sort of)
[00:11] <goddard> kunji: both
[00:12] <kunji> I use Matlab or C/C++ for neuron simulations.  Most of what I've used scripting for outside of Matlab has mainly been tinkering with stuff on my home server.
[00:12] <caiotarifa> iceroot: hen, your opinion makes sense, debian is the best option to run my webserver?
[00:13] <iceroot> caiotarifa: in my opinion debian is the best system if you want a really stable system
[00:13] <kunji> At some point I really need to take some time and look at OpenCL and CUDA...
[00:14] <iceroot> caiotarifa: but ubuntu has 5 years support for security updates (12.04) debian maybe 2-3
[00:14] <KsM> er
[00:14] <KsM> what
[00:15] <caiotarifa> iceroot: I know it's the same family of Ubuntu, but I really never installed debian.
[00:15] <dem0n> anyone have any suggestions for my issues with rubygems on ubuntu lucid?
[00:15] <KsM> debian has only 3 years of security updates?
[00:15] <iceroot> KsM: yes
[00:15] <iceroot> KsM: depending on how fast the next stable will be released
[00:16] <iceroot> lenny was imo 3 years
[00:16] <KsM> lenny just got dropped a few months ago
[00:16] <iceroot> KsM: lenny dropped on 14.2.2012
[00:16] <iceroot> or was it 14.2.2011? dont know anymore
[00:17] <KsM> "lenny EOL 2012-02-06"
[00:17] <goddard> kunji: you do neuron simulations?
[00:17] <iceroot> KsM: that is not "a few months"
[00:17] <KsM> it is in my time
[00:18] <zivester> how does one install the linux headers in 12.10 ? virtualbox is telling me it can't find them
[00:18] <ubuntulover> How do I make bootable dual layer DVD? They are Memorex.
[00:18] <iceroot> KsM: and it was 2009 - 2012
[00:18] <kunji> goddard: I was, I haven't done any too recently working of some finite state machine stuff for my thesis right now, but I think I'll probably go back to the neuron stuff afterwards.
[00:18] <iceroot> KsM: so its 3 years
[00:18] <iceroot> KsM: released 14.2.2009
[00:19] <iceroot> KsM: etch was only 2 years
[00:19] <caiotarifa> iceroot: You're leaving me confused, lol. Do you think I should learn Debian or continue using Ubuntu? Ubuntu has a long time support than Debian… but Debian is more stable...
[00:19] <iceroot> KsM: so as i said "depending when the new stable release is ready", so normally 2-3 years of support
[00:19] <ActionParsnip> caiotarifa: why not both?
[00:20] <ActionParsnip> caiotarifa: stability is subject to config and so forth
[00:20] <iceroot> caiotarifa: as i said, on webservers you want ultra stable (but old) software, you dont need the latest apache2 for example, you dont the latest openssh-server (bad example for debian...)
[00:20] <iceroot> caiotarifa: and ubuntu is using newer versions for apache2 and so on which is not tested so long then the old ultra stable debian version
[00:22] <iceroot> you also dont need kernel 3.6 on a server, there you want a ultra stable kernel which is tested (and also have longterm support) like 2.6.32 or 2.6.18
[00:22] <caiotarifa> iceroot: it's clear to me now… thanks for the tips friend!
[00:22] <ubuntulover> Anyone??
[00:23] <iceroot> caiotarifa: :) you are welcome
[00:23] <kunji> iceroot: kernel 3.2 wasn't so great for me...
[00:23] <ubuntulover> I need to know how to make bootable dual layer Ubuntu 12.10 DVDs... Memorex Dual Layer
[00:23] <bentinata> ubuntulover, use UNetBootIn
[00:23] <iceroot> caiotarifa: in the end its up to you what you will be using, both, ubuntu and debian are great systems and its not bad to know both systems
[00:25] <MK`> What is the name of the laptop battery applet in 11.10 for gnome fallback? Mine crashed, want to reenable it.
[00:26] <ActionParsnip> MK`: just so you know, Oneiric is EOL soon
[00:26] <ubuntulover> bentinata Do I use Hard Disk or USB Drive in UNetBootIn
[00:26] <MK`> I'm aware yes
[00:26] <MK`> This is sort of a now-problem X)
[00:26] <caiotarifa> iceroot: You're right, but for some reason I'm afraid of debian, it seems complicated. Don't even know how to install in a virtual machine.
[00:27] <ActionParsnip> MK`: cool. does a log off and on not resolve it?
[00:27] <kunji> Huh, if anything I would have said Debian was simpler than Ubuntu.
[00:27] <iceroot> caiotarifa: ubuntu is using the debian installer :) so its the same way
[00:27] <iceroot> caiotarifa: you will not see much difference in both systems
[00:27] <MK`> ActionParsnip I'm sure it will, but I am not able to log off right now.
[00:28] <iceroot> caiotarifa: especially if you are a beginner, both systems will look the same (debian is not using unity) but for the rest you will not see much differences

[00:29] <caiotarifa> iceroot: In last time I was trying to download version 6, had 51 CDs.
[00:29] <caiotarifa> iceroot: I started wrong? lol
[00:29] <iceroot> caiotarifa: easily spoken, ubuntu is debian with newer packages (thats what you will see as a beginner), for a more experiant user you will see more differences (upstart, systemd, not sudo on debian by default)

[00:29] <kunji> caiotarifa: I think you were looking at the one including all repos or something

[00:31] <zykotick9> iceroot: i see you point, but "ubuntu is debian with newer packages" is a misrepresentation of the truth...
[00:31] <iceroot> zykotick9: easily spoken for beginners

[00:33] <caiotarifa> iceroot: Many people recommended to me CentOS to make a webserver, you have an opinion about?
[00:33] <iceroot> !debian
[00:33] <ubottu> Ubuntu and Debian are closely related. Ubuntu builds on the foundations of Debian architecture and infrastructure, with a different community and release process. See https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/i386/what-is-debian.html - Remember, !repositories meant for Debian should NOT be used on Ubuntu!
[00:34] <zykotick9> iceroot: well, you can say "ubuntu is based off of debian" ;)  it would be difficult to describe all the differences in a short message...
[00:34] <kunji> caiotarifa: CentOS sucks balls, just my opinion of course ^_^, I much prefer apt based distros
[00:34] <iceroot> caiotarifa: centOS is "the same" as RHEL, which is a enterprise distro, i would not recommend it for normal LAMP systems but for oracle databases, sap systems, uc4 server and so on

[00:36] <codephobic> I'm trying to install zend framework 2 on ubuntu server, this is my first stab at it and I can't find a decent tutorial, any advice?
[00:38] <iceroot> caiotarifa: you will gace problems when you will be using enterprise software like oracle databases, sap and other evil stuff, they dont support debian and ubuntu officially, so then you have to use a supported distro like RHEL, SLES or unbreakable linux and CentOS is "just" the same as RHEL without the trademarks. CentOS, RHEL, SLES and unbreakable Linux are using rpm instead of deb, so you dont have apt-get/aptitude. every dis

[00:40] <mjj29> Hi all. I've recently moved to lubuntu
[00:40] <mjj29> and I have a few questions. Firstly, how can I get it to change to a dvorak keyboard layout everywhere? I can change it when I log it, but then it forgets it (and isn't true in lxdm for login)
[00:41] <mjj29> secondly, /etc/init.d and /etc/rc.d don't appear to be behaving as I expect them to. My service doesn't seem to be being started. Are there new runes I should be looking at?
[00:41] <caiotarifa> iceroot: makes sense, I didn't know… thanks again :D
[00:42] <iceroot> mjj29: set the keyboard layout to /etc/X11/xorg.conf for example to have it fixed in lxde

[00:54] <drek> Hi, I have a question! I added a script using update-rc.d to my bootup, and now my ubuntu server won't boot because it runs a daemon but i forgot to tell it to run in background
[00:54] <drek> it just runs the script and stops there
[00:54] <drek> instead of continuing booting
[00:55] <kunji> drek: have you got physical access to it, if so you can boot a livecd and fix it up
[00:55] <drek> i'm running it with vmware
[00:56] <drek> so i have to boot it with an livecd and fix that then?
[00:56] <ActionParsnip> drek: can you boot to root recovery mode?
[00:56] <drek> i don't know, how would i do that?
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> drek: hold SHIFT at boot
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> drek: select recovery mode, select root
[00:57] <drek> oooh, nice
[00:57] <XMLnewbi> after I run it terminal really isnt happy   when i hit enter it gives me my dir     XXX@XXXX:/home/user            and when i type it doesnt show my text
[00:58] <kunji> ActionParsnip: oh, hmm, cool, I wasn't sure if recovery mode would try running the script or not
[00:58] <XMLnewbi> is there a way to get out of that, or just restart the terminal?
[00:58] <ActionParsnip> XMLnewbi: try typing:  source ~/.bashrc     is it then ok?
[00:58] <ActionParsnip> kunji: nar, its recovery. Same as run level 1, single user

[01:11] <rootbrian> I have question, how in the world do you make ubuntu (or xorg xserver) display at a higher resolution than 1280x1024 (windows does higher, I know this for a fact), since my monitor supports 1400x1050 and 1920x1080.
[01:12] <rootbrian> graphics card is an ATI HD 4650
[01:12] <jrib> !fixres | rootbrian
[01:12] <ubottu> rootbrian: The X Window System is the part of your system that's responsible for graphical output. To restart your X, type « sudo /etc/init.d/?dm restart » in a console - To fix screen resolution or other X problems: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
[01:12] <rootbrian> by gigabyte
[01:12] <dr_willis> you installed the fglrx drivers?
[01:12] <jrib> yes, make sure you've installed the drivers for your card if you haven't
[01:13] <rootbrian> well I was curious about modifying the configuration file to allow more than what the monitor supposively supports.
[01:13] <rootbrian> yes, I have that driver installed
[01:13] <jrib> rootbrian: ubottu's link details that
[01:13] <rootbrian> I'll have a look.
[01:14] <kunji> rootbrian: quite often I find just renaming the xorg.conf and letting a new one get generated on boot fixes those sorts of problems for me, but not always, and it can sometimes not boot to a GUI, so know how to name it back before  doing it.

[01:19] <ActionParsnip> Dantes: no, its a spinoff, we don't support spinoffs here

[01:20] <ActionParsnip> Dantes: they have their own server and channel
[01:20] <Dantes> thank you
[01:20] <ProfesorDavis> sure thing, why is it that on unix i can type ls /volumes to see all installed harddrives
[01:21] <ActionParsnip> Dantes: no problemmo
[01:21] <ProfesorDavis> but when i do it on terminal on ubuntu i get no info?
[01:21] <kunji> Dantes: As he says, we don't support it here, but my general impression is that you should maybe look at running that Grub 2 script that finds the installs OSs
[01:21] <kunji> *installed
[01:22] <XMLnewbi> sudo echo 1 > /etc/pure-ftpd/conf/TLS permission denied
[01:22] <kunji> ProfesorDavis: I haven't really used unix, but my guess would be that drives are mounted by default in the /volumes directory on unix?  But on Ubuntu in /media, so try ls /media and see if that is what you were expecting.
[01:23] <ActionParsnip> XMLnewbi: sudo doesn't traverse the redirect
[01:23] <ActionParsnip> XMLnewbi: echo 1 | sudo tee /etc/pure-ftpd/conf/TLS
[01:23] <ProfesorDavis> i see, will do
[01:23] <ActionParsnip> XMLnewbi: the only part of your command with sudo access, is the echo command
[01:23] <ProfesorDavis> thansk kunji it worked
[01:24] <ActionParsnip> XMLnewbi: or 'tee -a' instead of '>>'

[02:02] <cmj141> question, i just downloaded a zip file fro the net, where do i extract the files (Android SDK bundle) to??
[02:03] <cmj141> i read package manager installs it for me and does all that work but i didnt use a package manager so im up s**t's creek without a paddle
[02:03] <ActionParsnip> cmj141: just put it where you like
[02:03] <dlentz> wbf, i'll look into it. why do you need to build the pegasus module? it hsould already be in kernel. do you need a newer version?
[02:04] <cmj141> ActionParsnip, ok, is there a specific file that holds software installed though? like 'etc' or 'opt'?
[02:05] <cmj141> not file i mean folder
[02:05] <ActionParsnip> cmj141: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AndroidSDK
[02:05] <wbf> dlentz, probably, do you have the link to the newer source?
[02:05] <cmj141> yeah i read that.. doesnt tell me where to extract to
[02:05] <ActionParsnip> cmj141: there is no set folder, you can use what you want
[02:05] <cmj141> oh thats not the same one
[02:06] <ActionParsnip> cmj141: why not make a subfolder in $HOME and use that
[02:06] <wbf> dlentz, cause i'm trying to get ubuntu for arm network working on my UG802 that's why I need to build it
[02:06] <cmj141> ActionParsnip, thanks for your help, Ill just follow that site you sent me.. that looks better than the others i read about putting them in Opt
[02:07] <ActionParsnip> cmj141: opt is another option, it doesn't matter as long as there is enough space on the partition you make the folder
[02:07] <ActionParsnip> cmj141: just don't put it in /run or /proc or some other tempfs folder :)

[02:40] <kunji> anon2739324: Hmm, that's what I thought, but it doesn't seem to start on boot after that, and there doesn't seem to be a way to right click -> add to panel for the applet anymore these days.  ps ax doesn't show it running.
[02:41] <anon2739324> maybe there is some sort of configuration problem
[02:41] <anon2739324> I would try aptitude purge network-manager; aptitude install network-manager
[02:42] <ActionParsnip> anon2739324: I suggets you advise apt-get, it handles multiarch better

[02:43] <illidari> I am new to linux c++ projects and im use to having a .sln file to open all the files in a project, how is this done in ubuntu/linux ? is there a way to view all files in a program at once of a downloaded source code?
[02:44] <ActionParsnip> kunji: if you get web access in liveCD, you can run:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install network-manager     then copy the deb files from /var/cache/apt/archives   to the internal partition, then install those after rebooting to the installed OS
[02:44] <SolarisBoy> illidari: vi/vim and a bunch of other text editors let you do things like that
[02:44] <kunji> anon2739324: I think because aptitude can have problems if you install the same package for 32 and 64 bit or something.
[02:45] <ActionParsnip> anon2739324: multiarch is handled in apt-get, its not in aptitude yet and people using 64bit OS may want 32bit apps (like skype)
[02:45] <SolarisBoy> anon2739324: vim *.h would open the header files in multiple buffers that you could browse- you could change the behaviour of that with command line opts and other plugins
[02:45] <WYZ4RD> SolarisBoy it enabled when I installed LibrePlan on it. I know little of Tomcat. I usually work in PHP
[02:45] <ActionParsnip> !aptitude
[02:45] <ubottu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[02:45] <kunji> ActionParsnip: It's less complicated than that I think, I'll just setup /etc/networking/interfaces temporarily
[02:45] <illidari> SolarisBoy: Do i have to set up the project, or can the editor auto open it up
[02:45] <ActionParsnip> kunji: that can work
[02:45] <SolarisBoy> WYZ4RD: i dont think it matters if your concern is opning the source - just use a text editor of choice
[02:45] <ActionParsnip> kunji: I use apt-fast personally :)

[02:47] <WYZ4RD> I don't know what the nohupping means. I'll research that. I've seen it several times.
[02:47] <illidari> SolarisBoy: i mean most programs or games have like 10+  .c / .cpp files that all must be built together , .sln in windows opened them all up at once in visual studio
[02:47] <anon2739324> but what 32 bit packages are available in the repos?
[02:47] <SolarisBoy> WYZ4RD: nohup - means dont send the HUP signal to processes attached to your session when you exit the session
[02:47] <anon2739324> are there many?
[02:48] <ActionParsnip> SolarisBoy: it sets the PPID as 1 :)
[02:48] <SolarisBoy> AFAIK the tomcat start scripts do a good job of daemonizing the process so you don't need to worry about it - which is why i asked how did you start tomcat?
[02:48] <anon2739324> I mean, I have been using aptitude for several months, and never had any issue with multiarch... Suppose there are few 32 bit packages, then
[02:48] <oitofelix> ActionParsnip: Audacious plays mms.
[02:48] <SolarisBoy> ActionParsnip: ouch
[02:48] <SolarisBoy> thats not good
[02:48] <ActionParsnip> anon2739324: all are both 32bit and 64bit in the repos, but skpe 64bit is really 32bit skype but with a tonne of 32bit packages to make it work

[02:50] <anon2739324> this will sound incredibly newbish, but how do you send a private message on IRC?
[02:50] <ActionParsnip> SolarisBoy: there could be a dummy process spawned by init which can hold orphaned process hands :)

[02:54] <ActionParsnip> SolarisBoy: you could add the mount of the iscsi in /etc/rc.local   so the network has had time to come up
[02:54] <SolarisBoy> !root
[02:54] <ubottu> Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[02:54] <ActionParsnip> !rootirc | root___
[02:54] <ubottu> root___: It's not technically our business, but we'd like to tell you that IRC'ing as root is a Very Bad Idea (tm). After all, doing anything as root when root is not needed is bad, and especially bad with software that connects to the Internet.
[02:54] <jonnyro> Is there a command line program in ubuntu to capture a frame from a webcam?

[02:55] <oitofelix> Has anyone experienced Tunapie hungup on downloading audio station list?
[02:55] <anon2739324> on irssi, what is an 'Act'? How do I switch between Acts?
[02:55] <SolarisBoy> ActionParsnip: true - for some reason i kind of hate that though - but ill try the netdev first and if not ill go with that thanks

[02:55] <ch1n4m4n> jonnyro that would be handy wouldn't it ;)
[02:55] <cmj141> question, I downloaded Eclipse SDK bundle from the net and extracted it to my home folder. How do i create an icon launcher in Slingshot?
[02:55] <xmlnewbi_> is there a way to do a system restore over SSH?
[02:55] <sirmxe> o'doyle rules
[02:55] <jonnyro> ch1n4m4n: looks like there is a program called fswebcam
[02:56] <jonnyro> or fxwebcam
[02:56] <xmlnewbi_> I gues reinstall is out of the question without phsyical access to the server
[02:56] <Doyle> You know it
[02:56] <ch1n4m4n> sweet
[02:56] <SolarisBoy> xmlnewbi_: its not really impossible but in a standard setup without other provisions - no

[02:57] <ubottu> uvccapture (source: uvccapture): USB UVC Video Class snapshot software. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5-2 (quantal), package size 13 kB, installed size 64 kB
[02:57] <SolarisBoy> xmlnewbi_: i've seen people put a fancy initramfs as a grub option and boot into it allowing them access to disks with no OS running on them, from there you can debootstrap/chroot all you want
[02:57] <ActionParsnip> ch1n4m4n: then run: uvccapture -d/dev/video0 -x640 -y480 -t10 -owebcam.jpg -q95
[02:57] <SolarisBoy> but that would probably be considered complex and not standard
[02:58] <xmlnewbi_> I broke something and cant seel to install anything without a wierd crash error. and  sudo ./fixpackage is returning the same error

[02:58] <ActionParsnip> xmlnewbi_: is it an issue with the status file?

[03:02] <ActionParsnip> xmlnewbi_: the fact you have mixed the sources is more than likely why you are getting issues
[03:03] <ActionParsnip> xmlnewbi_: I suggest you remove the Debian sources
[03:03] <greenwhale> what do you guys think about Debian's policy on packages updates? Just I think that there is no reason not to use up-to-date packages?
[03:04] <rootbrian> alright, I added all of the resolutions supported by my monitor, including refresh rates (had to go into windows to test it all, noted it down), but they're under "CRT2" as what xrandr says. How in the world do I get them all under "CRT1"?

[03:04] <greenwhale> oh, ok
[03:04] <greenwhale> sry
[03:05] <kunji> Hmm, can someone answer this for me, if I run an OpenVPN server on my network not in the gateway's place on the network, then would I actually need to use a bridge at all for the network resources to be accessible?  I'm thinking I wouldn't need to, but I'm not entirely sure, all the install guides seem to assume you're using the server it's on as your gateway device.
[03:05] <SolarisBoy> kunji: you may want to try in #networking too
[03:06] <ActionParsnip> xmlnewbi_: then they have caused you an issue, you have a frankenstein OS which nobody will want to touch

[03:11] <greenwhale> oh, ok
[03:11] <Soe1en> I can't write files anymore
[03:11] <Soe1en> not even as a root

[03:12] <ActionParsnip> te: df -h    is a bit more readable :)
[03:12] <te> ok
[03:12] <frustrated> could anyone let me know how to make youtube videos less stuttery on linux? if i download them as a .flv file, they work fine in vlc or mplayer.
[03:13] <ActionParsnip> frustrated: try minitube
[03:13] <rootbrian> Soe1en if you still can't mount it, then backup everything on it using root, then recreate the partition using a live CD or USB.
[03:13] <te> frustrated: buy more bandwidth
[03:13] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: http://pastebin.com/sKvXpixU

[03:13] <Soe1en> rootbrian: you mean reinstall ubuntu?
[03:14] <ActionParsnip> frustrated: tried a different browser?
[03:14] <rootbrian> Soe1en: Yes, but only if you exhausted everything
[03:14] <frustrated> yes i have ActionParsnip

[03:14] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: oh come on...seriously? Did you even read the command
[03:14] <rootbrian> Soe1en: /mount/point which basically means /media/disk
[03:15] <rootbrian> or a volume name
[03:15] <te> rootbrian: mount point, not volume name
[03:15] <rootbrian> Soe1en: disk can be substituted for anything
[03:15] <rootbrian> te: oops
[03:15] <te> rootbrian: But I'm sure he gets the point
[03:15] <Soe1en> rootbrian: how do I find out where my mount point is
[03:16] <te> Soe1en: mount
[03:16] <rootbrian> so nobody can possibly help me with that issue about xrandr not adding the modes to CRT1.
[03:16] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: is it the system file system you are having issue with, or is it the /home directory, or some other place?
[03:16] <rootbrian> I wanted to use the highest possible mode supported, 1080p
[03:17] <frustrated> ActionParsnip: what can i do for other flash video
[03:17] <lolmaniac> hello everyone, I am having some partition issues and issues with grub not recognizing the partitions and booting, it says no operating system, but when I run a live CD i can see the partitions, I even made them active, any advice?
[03:17] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: I dont know
[03:17] <ActionParsnip> frustrated: does chrome work ok?
[03:17] <Soe1en> rootbrian: so it's /dev/mapper/sil_bhadbgcdahff1 I guess
[03:17] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: so how do you know there is an issue?>
[03:17] <frustrated> chrome works great for everything except flash video, ActionParsnip
[03:17] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: it's the 4th time this is happening, and it is comming every day now
[03:18] <lolmaniac> but i still cannot boot or open grub
[03:18] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: and where can you not write to?
[03:18] <lolmaniac> right now I'm cloning the disk
[03:18] <te> lolmaniac: Unless we have specific information about your partitions and your grub configuration, we wouldn't be able to give any advise.
[03:18] <rootbrian> frustrated: Enable the HTML5 beta maybe? http://www.youtube.com/testtube
[03:18] <reaga> How much RAM does ubuntu use up
[03:18] <lolmaniac> what would I need to provide?
[03:18] <reaga> if i just install it and its idle
[03:18] <frustrated> rootbrian: extremely glitchy
[03:18] <lolmaniac> that boot info script?
[03:18] <ActionParsnip> reaga: about 300Mb here, ish
[03:19] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: at /dev/mapper/sil_bhadbgcdahff1

[03:19] <lolmaniac> ill be here all night possibly
[03:19] <lolmaniac> so
[03:20] <frustrated> root brian, is there a way to get vlc to automatically play all flash video
[03:20] <frustrated> rootbrian, is there a way to get vlc to automatically play all flash video
[03:20] <lolmaniac> ill chat you guys who are talking to me when I can get you the boot info results after the clone is complete
[03:20] <ActionParsnip> frustrated: isn't there mozilla-vlc or somesuch
[03:20] <lolmaniac> ty
[03:20] <rootbrian> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1515636/ output from xrandr, showing CRT2 with all the new modes added properly, not added to CRT1 which I was hoping for. I wonder if I missed any commands adding it.
[03:20] <ActionParsnip> frustrated: I know some folks use vlc for flash
[03:21] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: yes but you don't write to that, you write to that when it is mounted
[03:21] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: does that hold your OS? Do you boot to the raid for your OS?
[03:21] <rootbrian> frustrated: Some videos are flash only.
[03:21] <frustrated> thanks ActionParsnip: you wouldn't happen to know how to use vlc for flash on google chrome as well, would you?
[03:21] <rootbrian> frustrated: and there isn't much you can do about it either.
[03:22] <ActionParsnip> frustrated: no idea, I only install chrome and have zero issues, pepper flash is great
[03:22] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: I think so, please consider that I am a beginner
[03:22] <josif>  I'm running dual boot win7 and Ubuntu 12.10. Why can't I see my C: from the ubuntu command line when I cd into the folder?

[03:22] <xmlnewbi_> ahh, ActionParsnip         is it just all the "Hit http://backports.debian.org squeeze-backports/contrib Sources/DiffIndex" backports that were out of place in  http://pastebin.com/WMdVfZhK       I think I remember adding those my bad, there a way to get rid of them?

[03:23] <josif> Ubuntu?
[03:23] <josif> just a live iso from a flash drive
[03:23] <rootbrian> josif: is it already mounted?
[03:23] <ActionParsnip> josif: oh, so its running live. not installed?
[03:24] <josif> no i already have it installed and it's not mounted but I can't find the dev/sdx so I can't mount it
[03:24] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: I guess the easiest thing would be just to make a gigantic backup and reinstall ubuntu
[03:24] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: why do you not already have a backup?
[03:25] <ActionParsnip> josif: run:  sudo parted -l
[03:25] <ActionParsnip> josif: it will show the partitions
[03:25] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: I do make backups every day but only from some very important directories, I would like to have another one from the whole disk
[03:26] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: good :)
[03:27] <josif> ActionParsnip: I did and I see the size and file system and all that but how do mount it from there?
[03:27] <xmlnewbi_> E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[03:27] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: well that means lots of reconfiguring I guess : (
[03:30] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: what is /proc? it has like 20 gb of content in it, uh 40 gb, 50
[03:30] <Soe1en> holy cow 200 gb?
[03:31] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: is there a possibility it went to read-only because my harddisk is full?
[03:31] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: doesn't look full. what level of raid are you using?
[03:32] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: RAID 1, 1gb each one

[03:33] <Abhijit> Good morning. I have triple boot suse,fedora and lubuntu. my lubuntu suddenly disapper from grub (grub owned by suse). Even os-prober do not show lubuntu. but I can successfully chroot to lubuntu. This is strange.
[03:33] <Abhijit> help me please!
[03:34] <ActionParsnip> Soe1en: its an informational folder really, the link explains it well
[03:34] <ActionParsnip> Abhijit: if you run:  sudo update-grub   from the chroot, is it added
[03:35] <Abhijit> ActionParsnip, that will make grub owned by lubuntu that what i do not what.
[03:35] <Abhijit> want*
[03:35] <Abhijit> ActionParsnip, wait. after chrooting now osprober is detecting the lubuntu.
[03:35] <ActionParsnip> Abhijit: no, that wil update grub, it happens every time lubuntu installs a new kernel
[03:35] <Abhijit> ok
[03:36] <ActionParsnip> Abhijit: so no, it won't make it owned by lubuntu whatever that means)
[03:36] <Abhijit> ok
[03:36] <ActionParsnip> Abhijit: all the OSes will add to the grub config, there is no owning OS
[03:36] <Abhijit> ActionParsnip, when suse own grub it applies its own themes and settings. when i do update-grub from lubunt it applies its own theme and settings. that is owning.
[03:37] <ActionParsnip> Abhijit: thats theming, nothing more
[03:38] <Abhijit> ActionParsnip, so i want suse themes and settings and fonts. not the lubuntu
[03:39] <Soe1en> ActionParsnip: thanks for your help, I think I go to sleep now, have a nice day in advance!
[03:40] <ActionParsnip> Abhijit: the update-grub happens every time lubuntu installs a new kernel
[03:40] <Abhijit> ActionParsnip, ok
[03:40] <ActionParsnip> Abhijit: if you run it, it will possibly add the lubuntu boot to the grub config. If the kernels start over lapping in version then you are going to have issues
[03:41] <Abhijit> ActionParsnip, yeah

[03:56] <lauratika> same issue
[03:56] <mladoux> I would also check the encoded quality of the music on another computer to see if the issue persists if at all possible. Preferably one running a different OS.
[03:56] <ActionParsnip> lauratika: if you make another user, is it the same there?
[03:56] <mladoux> just to avoid any OS specific stuff.
[03:57] <lauratika> ActionParsnip: in the other user account the same

[04:04] <lauratika> why?
[04:05] <utf> any ideas?
[04:05] <thoonai> utf: im sorry but no
[04:05] <mladoux> [snake], have you installed the dev libraries of gtk2? not just the binaries.
[04:05] <utf> really?
[04:06] <utf> i've been trying for two days to get this working and i don't have any other OS to work with here
[04:06] <mladoux> utf, no worries. It can be fixed, a second os just makes things simpler.
[04:06] <utf> i answered parsnip but i haven't gotten a response as of yet
[04:06] <thoonai> I have the bad feeling that these distros are getting worse
[04:07] <[snake]> mladoux, I can't seem to find and dev files :(
[04:07] <lauratika> and then why not stays up above 100... when i down the volume with the keyboard media button it lowers to 100 again.
[04:07] <[snake]> err packages
[04:07] <ActionParsnip> utf: seems to use optimus, very headache inducing
[04:07] <thoonai> utf: list your hardware, check for compatibility, try  32 bit
[04:07] <ActionParsnip> utf: look into bumblebee. you'll have a lot of issues
[04:07] <mladoux> usually it'll be the same as the packages with -dev added to the end of the package name.
[04:08] <utf> like I said, I'm amateur
[04:08] <utf> no clue what that is
[04:08] <acu__> I'm trying to install my Epson WF-7010 printer and am getting this error message "[FAIL] Reloading Common Unix Printing System: cupsd failed!I need your help
[04:08] <[snake]> mladoux, I am using tab completion after gtk2 with nothing with a -dev
[04:08] <thoonai> utf: nvidia is an very unpleasant partner to linux
[04:08] <mladoux> just add dev after
[04:09] <utf> a friend of mine told me linux would be pretty simple but somehow i've ended up making my laptop useless
[04:09] <kunji> utf: how did you pull that off :P
[04:09] <ActionParsnip> utf: well you have optimus, its not very easy to tame but is possible
[04:09] <[snake]> mladoux, the package gtk2-dev doesn't show up is what I mean. that's ok, I think I found it on the ubuntu repository sites from an older ubuntu version.
[04:09] <ActionParsnip> utf: if you only had one GPU its drastically easiee
[04:09] <mladoux> Try installing libgtk2.0-dev, libpango1.0-dev, libcairo2-dev and libxml2-dev.
[04:09] <utf> so should I just give up on installing ubuntu?
[04:10] <mladoux> I think that's the libs you need
[04:10] <[snake]> mladoux, oh, lib. thanks!
[04:10] <utf> i really want it but this and the forums are my only real lifeline unless i go to a repair shop
[04:10] <thoonai> somebody an idea, why 12.04 server 32 bit is failing to install on my futro s400?
[04:10] <mladoux> utf, you can do whatever you want, if you want to use ubuntu, and have issues, we'll try to help you.
[04:11] <utf> well, i tried installing 12.04 per a friend's advice to fix the keyboard and mouse stuff, no luck
[04:11] <utf> didn't even boot toe install disc
[04:11] <utf> the*
[04:11] <thoonai> utf: which model?
[04:11] <ActionParsnip> utf: http://bumblebee-project.org/install.html
[04:11] <utf> so now I'm downloading the 64 version of 12.04
[04:11] <ActionParsnip> utf: try booting the OS with the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
[04:11] <mladoux> some machines have a harder time than others. It would help if we knew what hardware you are using.
[04:12] <ActionParsnip> utf: if possible, disable one of the GPUs in BIOS
[04:12] <utf> model of my laptop? MSI GT780DXR
[04:12] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: sandy bridge intel i7 with some mobile nvidia gpu too
[04:12] <mladoux> I see someone else is trying to help you, i'm going to butt out, to avoid confusion.
[04:12] <sh3bang> I have an nVidia sound card and my sound is way to low - pulseaudio any help please?
[04:12] <utf> how do i go about disabling a gpu?
[04:13] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: thanks
[04:13] <thoonai> somebody an idea, why 12.04 server 32 bit is failing to install on my futro s400?
[04:13] <thoonai> its like Hardware and os getting worse
[04:14] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: what happens when you start the instll?
[04:14] <ActionParsnip> utf: look around in the BIOS
[04:14] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: it works until it comes to grub
[04:14] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: are you using anything weird like uefi, raid, lvm etc?
[04:14] <utf> lol how do i look around in the bios, device manager?
[04:14] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: and the whole install process lags like an 100Mhz machine
[04:15] <ActionParsnip> utf: no, when the system starts to boot, read the screen. You will see an option to enter setup
[04:15] <utf> oh that
[04:15] <thoonai> utf: del, f2 or f12 normally
[04:15] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: does grub install ok?
[04:15] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: no
[04:15] <utf> well quick update, just booted into 12.10 and i got a message saying system program problem detected
[04:15] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: are you using anything weird like uefi, raid, lvm etc?
[04:16] <thoonai> after 2 hours waiting, I installed debian stable ^^ though i want ubuntu ;)
[04:16] <ActionParsnip> utf: if you can get web access, use the bumblebee guide I gave as well as get full updates
[04:16] <utf> then when I try to report it it says ubuntu has experienced an internal error
[04:16] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: no, it should run vdr in the end
[04:16] <ActionParsnip> utf: just get updated and install bumblebee
[04:16] <utf> so my version of 12.10 is all kinds of f'd up
[04:16] <ActionParsnip> utf: is it fully updated
[04:17] <utf> install bumble to my current 12.10?
[04:17] <thoonai> utf: try 11.04
[04:17] <utf> i'm not sure if it's fullly updated
[04:17] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: natty is eol
[04:17] <ActionParsnip> utf: I'd check that first before anything
[04:17] <utf> where can i check?
[04:17] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: I know, but I don't get crashing messages every 15 Minutes
[04:17] <utf> i had a prompt to update stuff once but my mouse and keyboard failed
[04:18] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: yes but there are zero updates and zero support anywhere for it...
[04:18] <thoonai> utf: do you have an usb keyboard ?
[04:18] <utf> no it's just my laptop keyboard
[04:18] <ActionParsnip> utf: press CTRL+ALT+F1 and log in there, then run:   sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
[04:19] <ActionParsnip> utf: you can also install bumblebee there
[04:19] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: *shrugs* I know, but its depressing if you install 12.04 or 12.10 on an thinkpad x61s (most compatible computer ever) and its conmplaining every half hour that a program crashed
[04:19]  * ActionParsnip hates optimus with a burning firey passion
[04:19] <thoonai> utf: nah I meant for repairing issues
[04:20] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: tried a different desktop?
[04:20] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: ideally one not using Compiz
[04:20] <utf> ok i'm running the update command you gave me action
[04:20] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: yes, I'm so sad that the stability of 11.04 is gone, I'm using gnome-shell
[04:20] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: does gnome-shell uses compiz?
[04:21] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: I don't believe so
[04:21] <utf> so far so good
[04:21] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: not 100% tbh
[04:21] <utf> so what would bumblee do for me?
[04:21] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: wikipedia says its mutter
[04:21] <ActionParsnip> utf: its supports your dual video chip fiasco
[04:23] <utf> ubuntu is wonky with dual video chips?
[04:23] <ActionParsnip> utf: get fully updated first. You may also want to run:   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:23] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: so the s400 hardware is in here: http://pastebin.com/Fh3cAxAp
[04:23] <kunji> thoonai: Hmm, certain hardware just like to complain in my case.  My s10-3t always has some piece of GUI crashing, and my little Foxconn tends to as well, but my Sony is pretty much crashless, as are all my desktops.
[04:23] <kunji> *likes
[04:23] <utf> oki, i'm at 59 percent with the current upgrades
[04:23] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes, nvidia stated they would not be supporting it outside windows
[04:23] <ActionParsnip> utf: but they did later join the linux foundation
[04:23] <utf> those bastards
[04:23] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: dafuq?
[04:23] <ActionParsnip> utf: bumblebee is a project trying to get it supported
[04:24] <utf> so after this is done you said i should run sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
[04:24] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: this is another proof of windiocrazy
[04:24] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: companies can chose whom they support
[04:25] <thoonai> kunji: thinkpads should run as they are since theyre the best supported linux platform
[04:25] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: which line am I lookng at in the pastebin please?
[04:25] <kunji> thoonai: I've actually never heard that before from anyone.
[04:26] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: true, but developing open source source driver is still better ^^ as amd does (as far as I know)
[04:26] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: nah thats lspci and lscpu
[04:26] <kunji> thoonai: Also are you counting System76 at all?
[04:26] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: yes, what are you trying to show me with it?
[04:26] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: because I coulndt see which hardware is blocking here
[04:27] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: also, dell will preinstall ubuntu if you want
[04:27] <utf> this is slow lol
[04:27] <thoonai> kunji: great ^^
[04:27] <ActionParsnip> utf: you have 3 months worth of updates
[04:27] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: my mother is using a dell and im not convinced
[04:27] <ActionParsnip> utf: its like clean installing XP and having to run updates
[04:27] <kunji> Though Dell does still pass on the window's license costs so you might as well take windows as well
[04:28] <utf> makes sense
[04:28] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: my Dell Lat D420 works 100% out of the box :)
[04:28] <thoonai> kunji: this sucks
[04:28] <utf> remind me of that second command you suggested
[04:28] <ActionParsnip> utf: sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:28] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: my x61s too ^^ with 11.04 as all my other boxes
[04:28] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: since I got to 11.10 I just had to repair  everything
[04:29] <kunji> Except for XP updates all the reboots will take you a month...
[04:29] <utf> thanksya
[04:29] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: back to topic: I want ubuntu running on my s400 ^^
[04:29] <thoonai> utf: I hope we could help you :)
[04:30] <utf> me too, i appreciate you guys helping me
[04:30] <utf> like i said I've been at this for the better part of two days lol
[04:31] <utf> i have a channel to run so it makes it doubly frustrating
[04:31] <ActionParsnip> utf: if its no good after the update, try bumblebee
[04:32] <thoonai> kunji: sadly these notebooks all have a glosy display and no clit mouse
[04:32] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: HA!
[04:32] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: o.o?
[04:32] <utf> uh-oh... after the updates finished i have a black screen
[04:32] <kunji> thoonai: I happen to hate those mice...
[04:32] <utf> pressed enter and now i have a command line
[04:33] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: clit mouse?    not nipple mouse?
[04:33] <ActionParsnip> utf: ok, use the bumblebee guide
[04:33] <utf> i'm going to install the second command you suggested
[04:33] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: I dont know how this thing really is named, everyone here just say clit mouse -.-
[04:33] <kunji> ActionParsnip: they didn't start including 2 did they?
[04:34] <alexhairyman> thoonai clit mouse? yum
[04:34] <utf> after this i'll see if it helps and if not i'll go ahead with bumble
[04:34] <thoonai> alexhairyman: ok its called 'pointing stick'
[04:35] <utf> what exactly is sudo apt-get dist-upgrade?
[04:35] <thoonai> utf: with this you can update your distro to the actual release
[04:35] <thoonai> utf: 12.04 --> 12.10
[04:36] <utf> oki, how do i exit this fullscreen terminal thing?
=== TheRainbowDusk is now known as TheRainbowDawn
[04:36] <utf> distro updated finished
[04:36] <utf> updates*
[04:36] <Omen_20> Why is Appearance still so bad? It's still a major pain adding wallpapers. Such a weird oversight.
[04:36] <thoonai> alt+f7 should display you the xserver (desktop) alt + f1-6 are console line terminals
=== jimerickson is now known as Guest18225
[04:38] <utf> ok, already the mouse is screwing up
[04:38] <utf> i can click things in the icon sidebar and the top bar but nothing on screen
[04:38] <utf> that's too weird
[04:38] <ActionParsnip> utf: use the CTRL+ALT+F1 prompt
[04:39] <utf> i'm there
[04:39] <ActionParsnip> utf: use the command sin the bumblebee guide for Ubuntu
[04:40] <ActionParsnip> utf: sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia
[04:40] <ActionParsnip> !info bumblebee-nvidia
[04:40] <ubottu> Package bumblebee-nvidia does not exist in quantal
[04:41] <ActionParsnip> utf: ok:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
[04:41] <ActionParsnip> utf: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia
=== Sickki_ is now known as Sickki
[04:41] <utf> the guide told me to use sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable
[04:41] <utf> do i do that one too?
[04:42] <ActionParsnip> utf: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee  names a different PPA,may be worth using instead
[04:42] <ActionParsnip> utf: which command/s have you ran?
[04:42] <utf> i already installed sudo add-apt-repository ppa:bumblebee/stable, should i go ahead and do the one you added too?
[04:42] <utf> ^
[04:43] <ActionParsnip> utf: stick with the stable if it supports your nvidia
[04:43] <utf> is there a way i can test to see if it worked?
[04:43] <ActionParsnip> utf: if you have a 6xx nvidia you will need the xswat updates
[04:43] <ActionParsnip> utf: then run the: sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic
[04:44] <ActionParsnip> utf: step 5 says reboot :)
=== Wonder is now known as Guest24983
[04:44] <utf> i don't know what nvidia i have lol
[04:44] <crond> Hi, I installed my nvidia drivers, and now my boot up screen is text and ugly.  It's obviously not a HUGE issue, but I'd kind of like the nice boot screen back.  How do I do so?
[04:46] <Guest24983> quit
[04:47] <utf> could you elaborate on "if you have a 6xx nvidia you will need the xswat updates" please?
[04:48] <kfizz> I don't have Verdana installed on my system and some websites that use Verdana as a font-family instead of a sans-serif display an ugly serif font. Is there any way I can "link" Verdana to to DejaVu Sans?
[04:48] <ActionParsnip> utf: its a 570M, so the stable PPA on its own is enough
[04:49] <ActionParsnip> utf: if it was a 670M  then it would be a 6xxx nvidia. But yours is not
[04:49] <utf> so should I run the sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic now?
[04:50] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes
[04:50] <utf> k i'll do that now
=== vjn_ is now known as vjn
[04:51] <kunji> kfizz: you could probably just install Verdana?
=== anonymous_ is now known as anonymous_jim
[04:52] <kfizz> kunji, Yeah, I know, but this is a new machine and I'm trying to keep it as FOSS as possible.
[04:52] <utf> uhoh, said "unable to locate package bumblebee"
[04:52] <utf> as well as "unable to locate bumblebee-nvidia"
[04:52] <utf> with E: before both
[04:52] <kunji> kfizz: Oh, well then I guess that's out?  I actually have no idea what the legal status of Verdana is.
=== jimerick1on is now known as jimerickson
[04:54] <kfizz> kunji, according to Wikipedia, it's proprietary. It's not the end of the world if I have to install it, I just wasn't sure if there was a way to trick the system into thinking DejaVu sans was Verdana.
[04:54] <ActionParsnip> utf: did you run:  sudo apt-get update
[04:55] <utf> yeah, i typed sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic
[04:55] <kunji> I wonder what is used to verify a font, would it be possible to just pick a font you like, rename it as verdana and install it?  Or perhaps some metadata-ish characteristics need to be messed with.
[04:55] <utf> is there supposed to be two bumblebees in the command?
[04:55] <otherenergy> anyone who might be ineterested in a job?
[04:56] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes, there are 2 packages 'bumblebee' and 'bumblebee-nvidia'
[04:56] <kfizz> kunji, I think I'll try doing something like that.
[04:56] <utf> yup, that's exactly what i typed
[04:56] <utf> and i got those messages in return
[04:56] <kunji> When and what kind?  I'm not interested in a job in the slightest until around midsummer :P
[04:57] <otherenergy> a bank job
[04:57] <ActionParsnip> utf: try the x updates PPA then
[04:57] <utf> what's that?
[04:57] <otherenergy> when time still not yet
[04:57] <ActionParsnip> utf: read the bumblebee guide
[04:57] <kunji> Hmm, bank job, I'll pass I think, doesn't sound very interesting.
[04:58] <ActionParsnip> kunji: isn't that where Tyra Banks does it ;)
[04:58] <otherenergy> are u ok and ready in backtrack techniques?
[04:58] <utf> oh the x-swat commant?
[04:58] <otherenergy> if so then it sounds interesting enough
[04:59] <utf> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates
[04:59] <ActionParsnip> otherenergy: ask in #backtrack-linux
[04:59] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes
[04:59] <kunji> ActionParsnip: She's a bit old for me
[04:59] <utf> i'll try it now
[04:59] <ActionParsnip> utf: then run:  sudo apt-get update   after, then try installing the bumblebee packages again
[04:59] <utf> why could those two files be found if i just installed them though?
[04:59] <utf> doesn't make sense to me :/
[04:59] <utf> couldn't*
[05:00] <ActionParsnip> utf: they didn't install, the packages were not found
[05:00] <utf> oh
[05:00] <zykotick9> utf: regarding you question earlier about "what is dist-upgrade", it does NOT update from version to version 12.04->12.10!  it updates every possible package on your system, like what the gui "update manager" does.  see "/msg ubottu dist-upgrade" for further details.
[05:00] <utf> so after i do this i do sudo apt-get install bumblebee bumblebee-nvidia linux-headers-generic again?
[05:00] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes
[05:01] <kevo> Hey everyone can someone tell me how Xubuntu 12.10 is and if it's even worth getting compared to other versions? The XFCE interface looks so clean but I wanted to be sure it was a pretty stable system.
[05:01] <utf> gotcha zyko, thanks
[05:01] <ActionParsnip> kevo: yes its stable
[05:01] <ActionParsnip> kevo: 12.04 is lts though.... :)
[05:02] <kevo> ActionParsnip I thought they had 12.10?
[05:02] <ActionParsnip> kevo: yes 12.10 is out, released october (10)th month, in 20(12)
[05:03] <ActionParsnip> kevo: supported 18 months, so is EOL in April 2014
[05:03] <kevo> ActionParsnip I just realised you said LTS sorry about that. Let me ask you this how is it with the Nvidia driver problem going around and setting up?
[05:04] <ActionParsnip> kevo: not had an issue with my 6150 on Quantal.
[05:04] <utf> so after running sudo apt-get update it said some index files failed to download
[05:04] <utf> is that ok?
[05:04] <thoonai> utf: which ones?
[05:05] <utf> it said failed to fetch and the address of the disc in my cd drive
[05:05] <kevo> ActionParsnip I have a GTX 670 and I heard it was a pain in the butt to install.
[05:05] <utf> think i just answered my own question lol
=== alejandro is now known as Guest50823
[05:06] <thoonai> utf: ^^
[05:06] <utf> but there's no disc in my cd drive... odd
[05:07] <utf> it's the cd that had 12.04 on it that failed to install
[05:07] <utf> weird
[05:07] <ActionParsnip> utf: run:  sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list    add a hash to the left of the line referencing the CD as a package source and press CTRL+X, press Y, press ENTER
[05:07] <thoonai> ActionParsnip: you were daster
[05:07] <thoonai> faster ^^
[05:07] <ActionParsnip> thoonai: too much CLI
[05:07] <utf> a hash to the left of the line? huh?
[05:08] <thoonai> utf: you comment out the line with a #
[05:08] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes.... a '#'
[05:08] <utf> so before sudo?
[05:08] <thoonai> no in the file
[05:08] <utf> oh, an octothorpe
[05:08] <thoonai> nano is an editor
[05:08] <ActionParsnip> utf: no, run the command, it open a file in a CLI text editor
[05:09] <ActionParsnip> utf: you then add the hash to the text file, save the change and it will make the system not use the CD as a source for packages
[05:09] <mq521> wow is this is like twitter?
[05:09] <ActionParsnip> mq521: using hash for comments was long before twitter :)
[05:09] <mq521> yeah joking
[05:09] <ActionParsnip> mq521: was keeping it going. hence the smiley :)
[05:09] <utf> confused
[05:10] <thoonai> utf: bout?
[05:10] <utf> added a hash to make it #deb cdrom etc
[05:10] <ActionParsnip> utf: run:  sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[05:10] <utf> i'm in the cli
[05:10] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes, now press CTRL+O, CTRL+X
[05:10] <utf> how do i know if i did it right?
[05:10] <utf> damn
[05:10] <ActionParsnip> utf: if the line now reads deb cdrom.... then its great
[05:10] <rkhshm> I have a question regarding HA ... i saw 2 tookits ; pacemaker and drdb .. any idea on these competing products?
[05:10] <utf> it reads #deb cdrom
[05:11] <rkhshm> i mean which one is better and when to use what?
[05:11] <thoonai> utf: fine, now save
[05:11] <utf> save?
[05:11] <ActionParsnip> utf: perfect now CTRL+O, CTRL+X
[05:11] <utf> ok
[05:11] <utf> that did nothing
[05:11] <utf> i have an empty command line with the cli above it
[05:12] <thoonai> yes
[05:12] <ActionParsnip> utf: fine, you just editted the file, so it DID do something
[05:12] <thoonai> do cat ;file;
[05:12] <utf> ctrl 0 did nothing
[05:12] <utf> and ctrl O
[05:12] <thoonai> ctrl o not 0
[05:12] <ActionParsnip> utf: you don't get a little message saying what it did, it's redundant. It saved the file
[05:12] <utf> Just made a new line
[05:12] <utf> ctrl o maked a new line
[05:13] <ActionParsnip> utf: it's ctrl+O not zero  it's to write the file (o)ut :)
[05:13] <utf> makes*
[05:13] <utf> i used ctrl o after i realized my mistake
[05:13] <utf> it just made a new line
[05:13] <utf> and ctrl x didn't do anything either... this is weird
[05:14] <ActionParsnip> utf: does the screen change, check the bottom of the console when you hit CTRL+X
[05:14] <utf> nothing
[05:14] <utf> ctrl o made a new line and ctrl x did zilch
[05:15] <utf> not even a blip
[05:15] <ActionParsnip> utf: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[05:15] <utf> it says
[05:15] <utf> ubuntu 12.10 /n /1
[05:16] <utf> \n \1*
[05:16] <KsM> You mean \l ?
[05:16] <utf> can i just redo the entire thing?
[05:16] <ActionParsnip> utf: ok, run:  sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old; sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/quantalsources.list
[05:16] <ActionParsnip> utf: all one command
[05:17] <utf> in the cli?
[05:17] <KsM> yes
[05:17] <ActionParsnip> utf: yes
[05:17] <ActionParsnip> easier
[05:17] <utf> i guess i'm still in the cli
[05:17] <thoonai> ok someone has a s400?
[05:17] <utf> i'm so confused at this point
[05:17] <utf> i still see multicolored text towards the top
[05:17] <utf> it ends with "wrote 57 lines"
[05:18] <ActionParsnip> utf: /quit
[05:19] <utf> quit does nothing
[05:19] <utf> no such file or directory
[05:20] <utf> i think i just need to redo all this cli stuff, i have no idea what happened
[05:22] <utf> i know i'm making this harder than it has to be but what do i do now? i got lost at the cdrom crap
=== karthik is now known as Guest52487
[05:26] <utf> so...
[05:27] <utf> gonna guess the guy gave up
[05:27] <thoonai> utf: which guy?
[05:28] <thoonai> utf: just hard thinking ^^
[05:28] <utf> parsnip
[05:28] <utf> kinda left me hanging on /quit
[05:28] <utf> it wouldn't work
[05:28] <dcope> is there a working config for a multitouch macbook air trackpad?
[05:28] <utf> so i dunno what to do now
[05:29] <thoonai> ok this is the hardest case ive seen ever ^^
[05:29] <utf> after all this stuff it's over like that... i appreciate the help i got at least
[05:30] <utf> unless that /quit was his way of saying he gives up
[05:30] <thoonai> utf: dont know, but where youve been at last?
[05:31] <utf> back in the cli getting rid of the cdrom thing
[05:31] <utf> then he just stopped helping

[05:37] <thoonai> though its 6:37am and im still awake ^^
[05:38] <Diazo> Howdy all, I was curious if anybody knew if this were a bug. When I turn the laptop and LightDM appears sometimes artifacts appear on the LightDM login screen and I have to hit enter for it to go away and log in.
[05:38] <utf> well, i could use some help installing flash player
[05:38] <utf> so far my mouse and keyboard are working fine
[05:38] <cub> flash?
[05:38] <cub> from adobe?
[05:39] <utf> yeah
[05:39] <cub> what version of ubuntu are u on
[05:39] <lorddelta> Evening.
[05:40] <cub> i seem to remember flash already being installed..
[05:40] <lorddelta> I don't suppose being in here when I'm on my windows side is heresy...
[05:40] <cub> i know i had to install java tho
[05:40] <lorddelta> :P
[05:40] <cub> windows is fine
[05:40] <utf> nope, flash isn't installed
[05:40] <utf> just installed 12.10
[05:40] <utf> and i can't figure out how to install it
[05:40] <thoonai> lorddelta: no, it isnt heresy, its an insult and my lordship will ignore thoust
[05:41] <lorddelta> I hear so much shit 'bout Shuttleworth all the time...but really is he any worse than say Gnu's leader (what'shisname)?
[05:41] <cub> tried this yet ? http://forums.adobe.com/message/4724232 utf
[05:41] <Diazo> utf, Do you know how to use the Ubuntu Software Center? Flash should be in that area.
[05:41] <lorddelta> I don't like it when people insult other people.
[05:41] <lorddelta> Because of what they do for a living.
[05:41] <lorddelta> =/
[05:41] <jacamol> greetings. please may i request some assistance in getting a working xorg.conf (12.04)
[05:41] <lorddelta> Granted I'm a loyal ubuntu-er but.
[05:41] <lorddelta> ubuntu-ist
[05:42] <thoonai> lorddelta: this belongs to #ubuntu-offtopic, huh?
[05:42] <utf> well i found this <ActionParsnip> utf: ok, run:  sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.old; sudo wget -O /etc/apt/sources.list https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/quantalsources.list
[05:42] <utf> oops
[05:42] <utf> hold on
[05:42] <lorddelta> thoonai: perhaps. Is there a great deal of social chatter; I'm looking for ubuntu flavored chat.
[05:42] <cub> utf try in terminal ' sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer'
[05:42] <cub> that might help
[05:42] <cmj141> hi, when package manager installs software, where does it install to?
[05:42] <lorddelta> I was just in ##mac for a couple hours...that was fun
[05:42] <thoonai> lorddelta: there you will find it, promised
[05:43] <kdns> Hi All. What's going on with Flash today? Every video I try to watch in firefox, it tells me I need the newest flash, but the only one I can use on their download page, is to compile from source... While looking into it, I've found that firefox has disabled java because it's too old... This was all working fine just hours ago... anyone?
[05:43] <lorddelta> thoonai: sweet
[05:43] <dr_willis> compile flash from source?
[05:43] <kdns> I'd prefer not to.
[05:44] <utf> well i'm using this link
[05:44] <utf> http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-install-flash-player-10.html
[05:44] <dr_willis> kdns:  what source?
[05:44] <utf> but there's no "deb" to grab at the adobe site
[05:44] <cub> kdns, might want to try getting java to be enabled
[05:44] <cub> i noticed sometimes when java is disabled on firefox, then flash will not work either
[05:44] <dr_willis> adobe dosent distribute debs. the flash-installer package downloads the tar.gz archive i thought
[05:44] <utf> is ubuntu even worth it if it's this much hassle just for flash?
[05:45] <ActionParsnip> utf: do you have an ok desktop now?
[05:45] <dr_willis> utf:  better to ask if flash is worth the hassle
[05:45] <utf> i think so
[05:45] <cub> utf, honestly
[05:45] <ActionParsnip> utf: install chrome browser, it has inbuilt flash
[05:45] <utf> it hasn't failed yet
[05:45] <utf> yet is the key term
[05:45] <cub> i have been using ubuntu a lot now, i'm not a fan of linux either, but in comparison most everything you can do in windows you can do on linux
[05:45] <kdns> utf, it's not usually this much hassle.
[05:45] <dr_willis> i dont even use flash to watch videos at most sites
[05:46] <ActionParsnip> dr_willis: flash games use flash though ;)
[05:46] <cub> besides i had a terrible experience with windows last week, couldnt get a simple program installed right without all kinds of dll's and all that
[05:46] <dr_willis> flash games are doodie. ;)
[05:46] <kdns> thx dr_willis, i was trying to figure out what the installer does. There was an update to the flash-installer on synaptic last night, I think that might be the source of my woes.
[05:47] <utf> oh my god
[05:47] <skp1> hi i just set my launcher to autohide but when i move the mouse to the left side of the screen it doesnt automatically appear, i have to slide the mouse up or down to make the launcher appear. does anyone know how to fix this?
[05:47] <dr_willis> ive not updated my ubuntu box this week. so no idea whats updates are out

[05:47] <utf> even chrome won't install
[05:47] <cub> utf why not
[05:47] <cub> i have chrome and firefox both
[05:47] <ActionParsnip> utf: did you grab the deb from the google website?>
[05:47] <utf> "dependency is not satisfiable"
[05:47] <utf> yes
[05:47] <utf> not*

[05:47] <skp1> .. hehe
[05:48] <thoonai> how does a system can crash like this?
[05:48] <thoonai> its just *argh*
[05:48] <cub> why not just install chrome from within  Synaptic?
[05:48] <jacamol> greetings. please may i request some assistance in getting a working xorg.conf (12.04)
[05:48] <thoonai> jacamol: what is not working?
[05:48] <cure_life> you can download flash player source code, and there is a file named libflashplayer.so, mv that file in to the ~/.mozilla/plugins/  then firefox can use the flash player
[05:49] <dr_willis> jacamol:  x should auto configure and not need a xorg.conf for the most part
[05:49] <thoonai> cub: this whole system seems to be messed up
[05:49] <utf> action that just nbrought up "the following package was automatically installed and is no longer requited: linux-headers-3.5.0-17"

[05:49] <utf> this is going to make me go up a wall
[05:49] <jacamol> thoonai: hi, and thanks. it simply does not. my video chip is the dreaded sis mirage 3. the driver is being loaded although i am left with a blank screen - attempting autoconfig fails
[05:49] <cub> skp1, does this happen on a restart too?
[05:50] <utf> can't install flash, can't install chrome
[05:50] <jacamol> thoonai: i used this: http://ajoliveira.com/ajoliveira/uk/software/xorg.php (my laptop is actually the very same, but yeah... blank screen)
[05:50] <cub> utf, you tried installing chrome using Synaptic Package Manager?
[05:50] <utf> i'll take you thru what i did

[05:51] <utf> ugh
[05:52] <utf> i downloaded the deb
[05:52] <skp1> utf
[05:52] <skp1> apt-get install -fr
[05:52] <utf> double clicked it and it took me to ubuntu software center
[05:52] <skp1> apt-get install -f
[05:52] <utf> and i got that error
[05:52] <ActionParsnip> utf: install it in terminal, its a bit easier
[05:53] <utf> still nothing useful
[05:53] <dr_willis> the terminal is often much easier. ;)
[05:53] <utf> it just brought up e: command line option "r" from "fr" is not know
[05:53] <utf> this is nuts
[05:53] <dr_willis> what are you doing exactly. and what error message
[05:53] <ActionParsnip> utf: what file name do you have and where is it located?
[05:54] <utf> google-chrome-stable-current_amd64.deb, in my downloads folder
[05:54] <ActionParsnip> utf: adobe are dropping flash for Linux soon, so you'll nee chrome
[05:54] <utf> yes but i can't even download chrome
[05:55] <ActionParsnip> utf: ok, run:  sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/google-chrome-stable-current_amd64.deb; sudo apt-get -f install
[05:55] <utf> install*
[05:55] <ActionParsnip> utf: you have downloaded it, or the deb wouldn't be in the ~/Downloads folders
[05:56] <dr_willis> i like 'sudo gdebi foo.deb'    seems to work nicer for me
[05:56] <dr_willis> but gdebi is not installed by default.
[05:56] <utf> no such file or directory?!
[05:56] <utf> omg
[05:57] <dr_willis> check your speling... and stop omging...

[05:57] <dr_willis> or just panic and run around like your pants are on fire..
[05:57] <kdns> ActionParsnip: try && instead of ; ,to ensure successful execution of the prior command.
[05:57] <utf> it's frustration
[05:57] <cub> utf, the files and folders on linux are case sensitive
[05:57] <utf> yeah, thanks for telling me i have no room for frustration
[05:57] <utf> very helpful willis
[05:58] <cub> so if you type download instead of Download, and there is no download folder (with lower d) it will come back.. no such file folder
[05:58] <ActionParsnip> utf: I gave the exact command, if you garbage the case then I cannot accommodate for that
[05:58] <dr_willis> if you want to get this fixed.. you dont need frustration
[05:58] <dr_willis> it makes our job harder
[05:58] <utf> three letters
[05:58] <ActionParsnip> kdns: oh yeah totally but it'd be ok, plus the -f install doesn't break anything if there is nothing to do
[05:58] <dr_willis> tab completion a;so helps avoid typos
[05:59] <utf> like that one?
[05:59] <jacamol> ahh, there's a bit more on this one: http://pastebin.com/7kchiekn

[06:01] <leonardpop> hello! i need help with internet connection through wifi. I installed ubuntu 12.10 minimal, gnome shell, nvidia+bumblebee and a bunch of apps. Internet connection is inconsistent, mostly slow. i had win7 on this laptop and internet was fast (i have a broadband connection, average download speed is 2 MB/s. Thank you!
[06:01] <utf> i think it worked
[06:01] <kdns> yeh, the new flashplugin-installer doesn't download and install the new flash, at all.
[06:02] <utf> but i can't find chrome
[06:02] <utf> where would it have downloaded to?
[06:02] <cub> utf, type in terminal 'google-chrome'
[06:02] <dr_willis> command is 'google-chrome'
[06:02] <kdns> fortunately there's now a package called adobe-flashplugin, which is actually a deb of the flash plugin and installs directly.
[06:02] <dr_willis> kdns:  thats interesting..
[06:03] <kdns> that got it working, but you guys who hang around here and give out support , might want to watch out for this as people update...
[06:03] <utf> not found
[06:03] <utf> unreal
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> utf: don't confuse the word 'install' with 'download'
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> utf: if you search dash, you will find it
[06:04] <thoonai> do 'chromium-browser' in your terminal ^^
[06:04] <ActionParsnip> utf: also run:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade     you just also added the google repo, so you can get updates to chrome :)
[06:04] <utf> it's not in my dash either
[06:04] <utf> wow
[06:04] <thoonai> open dash and type chrome
[06:04] <utf> not there
[06:04] <thoonai> utf: try 'chromium'
[06:05] <utf> not there either
[06:05] <utf> i'm stunned
[06:05] <thoonai> utf: me too
[06:05] <skp1> we're all stunned.
[06:05] <thoonai> utf: this never happened to us either
[06:05] <jacamol> i just found something. going to try it
[06:05]  * dr_willis is flaberghasted
[06:06] <ActionParsnip> utf: can you run the command in terminal to install the deb file, and use http://pastebin.ubuntu.com to give us the output
[06:06] <utf> not a singl thing i've done since installing this has worked
[06:06] <utf> one sec ActionParsnip
[06:06] <thoonai> utf: I wish you all luck for a working system, hang on ^^
[06:07] <thoonai> goodnight all
[06:07] <utf2> logging in on my afflicted laptop now that my keyboard and mouse work
[06:08] <kdns> There comes a time when one must accept, that their hardware does not play well with linux.
[06:08] <utf2> ActionParsnip:  what was it you suggested i do?
[06:08] <kdns> If your keyboard wasn't working, you have serious problems and shouldn't even be considering a browser yet.
[06:08] <utf2> well it works now
[06:09] <ActionParsnip> utf2: rerun the command you ran to install the deb file and copy the output, use http://pastebin.ubuntu.com to hold the text
[06:09] <hexstatik> hey i was messing around with emerald theme manager, but now its set to a theme i dont like. How do i reset to the original 12.10 theme?
[06:09] <jacamol> yeah, no joy there. i think it's something to do with 'modeline' - i'll await advice. thanks a lot
[06:09] <kdns> working now has nothing to do with why the heck it didnt work out of the box
[06:09] <skp1> hexstatik: gtk-window-decorator --replace
[06:09] <utf2> it ws going out on cue every 10 minutes and since action helped last it hasn't gone out
[06:09] <ActionParsnip> utf2: when the page changes after you hit the 'paste' button, copy the new address in the address bar and paste it here
[06:09] <hexstatik> ty
[06:10] <utf2> redoing the command now
[06:10] <kdns> utf I can tell you need a hand and I'd love to help but I kind ahave to go for a bit, and you seem well taken care of... so I'll give you one bit of advice
[06:10] <kdns> SLOW DOWN
[06:10] <kdns> take it one thing at a time
[06:10] <utf2> kdns: noted, i appreciate it
[06:10] <kdns> if your keyboard isn't working, dont rush to fix it... find out WHY it isnt working.
[06:11] <utf2> well if it goes out again I'll accept my fate
[06:11] <kdns> if you can't find a file, dont rush to find it, find out WHY you can't find it already
[06:11] <utf2> lol
[06:11] <utf2> makes sense
[06:11] <kdns> lol
[06:11] <kdns> it might take a bit longer, but it'll be much smoother and less stressful for you :)
[06:12] <utf2> sound advice
[06:12] <kdns> I'll be back in 30 mins or so and help out if you're still stuck.
[06:12] <kdns> good luck man

[06:21] <hexstatik> does anyone know how to change the font color and icon size in dash?
[06:21] <cache_za> i actually installed gnome 3 again after a while, much better than last time i tried it
[06:21] <ActionParsnip> utf2: http://askubuntu.com/questions/220960/cannot-install-google-chrome-how-do-i-fix-it
[06:21] <Sarah> whats xfce ?
[06:22] <ActionParsnip> utf2: you need the universe repo enabling
[06:22] <uw> sounds great!  give me another update in a few years and maybe ill try it again too
[06:22] <ActionParsnip> Sarah: a light desktop environment
[06:22] <cache_za> :D
[06:22] <HonestAbe> not as light as lxde i hear though
[06:22] <Sarah> ubuntu right ?
[06:22] <HonestAbe> yes
[06:22] <HonestAbe> *xubuntu
[06:22] <ActionParsnip> utf2: you need to edit /etc/apt/sources.list again, and UNcomment the lines with the word 'universe' on that start with the word 'deb'
[06:23] <ActionParsnip> Sarah: its a different desktop, super light, using few resources
[06:23] <hexstatik> and does anyone know any better UI solutions for alt+tab
[06:23] <uw> wat
[06:23] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: the ring switcher in Compiz if you use it
[06:23] <utf2> kk i'll see what that does for me
[06:24] <aeon-ltd> hexstatik: don't use alt-tab, dedicate workspaces?
[06:24] <utf2> so do what that guide does then uncomment those lines?
[06:24] <ActionParsnip> utf2: the packages are available, just not known to the package system as they are disabled right now, they are easily enabled
[06:24] <lahwran> WHAT THE FLYING -- UGH. ubuntu is, for some worthless reason, putting 127.0.0.1 in resolv.conf, which is causing dns to hang and then fail! why in the world is it doing this, and what can I do to undo this useless behavior?
[06:24] <lahwran> this has to be something someone thought was a good idea
[06:24] <ActionParsnip> utf2: just uncomment the lines for the universe repo and they will be available after a: sudo apt-get update
[06:25] <ActionParsnip> lahwran: you are using dnsmasq now, it caches the resolutions. It is normal
[06:25] <ActionParsnip> lahwran: its not useless.
[06:25] <utf2> so I don't need to use that guide, just uncomment the lines
[06:25] <lahwran> ActionParsnip: it is useless, how do I undo
[06:25] <lahwran> it
[06:25] <ActionParsnip> lahwran: you can add extra DNS servers if you like using the config file, let me get the name for you
[06:26] <lahwran> I want to remove it so that it does not put 127.0.0.1 on the list. how do I do that?
[06:26] <hexstatik> aeon-ltd: i use two 24 inch screens so really dont see the need for multiple workspaces
[06:26] <hexstatik> ActionParsnip: lemme try
[06:26] <ActionParsnip> lahwran: echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base > /dev/null
[06:26] <Need> Hey all. i am having issues dual booting. i have done the non wubi install with no issues in the past with a different pc. ive installed it, i dont get a grub menu, ive used easy bcd to no avail. i am ona gigabyte uefi motherboard
[06:26] <utf2> confused again, i swear i'm not dense but you kinda tied me up
[06:26] <ActionParsnip> lahwran: that will make the name server you add, be added to /etc/resolv.conf each boot
[06:27] <Need> nick/ boot help
[06:27] <Need> whoops
=== vjn_ is now known as vjn
[06:27] <ActionParsnip> Need: if you hold shift, do you see Grub?
[06:27] <Need> when i boot? ive tried it once with no luck
[06:27] <lahwran> ActionParsnip: clever with teeing sudo. will that remove the 127.0.0.1 server? because my issue is arising from the fact that that 127.* server is *slowing down* resolution
[06:28] <utf2> ActionParsnip:  you sent me that link and then told me to go into some command and uncomment lines... do i do both?
[06:28] <Need> i believe it is a uefi bios problem. i have no idea what else it can be. i am still new to linux terminal and such
[06:29] <ActionParsnip> lahwran: the 127.0.0.1 will stand but the 8.8.8.8 wil be added extra
[06:30] <lahwran> ActionParsnip: will it be before 127, then?
[06:30] <lahwran> blah, rebooting this machine takes forever
[06:30] <ActionParsnip> utf2: all you need to do is uncomment the lines. The page just explains why
[06:31] <hexstatik> ActionParsnip: its pretty cool, not sure that its more effecient tho
[06:31] <utf2> but the page tells me to go into software manager and do all that stuff...
[06:31] <ActionParsnip> utf2: you can do it that way if you wish, it achieves the same
[06:32] <utf2> i can't even find where "edit" is in the software center
[06:34] <rinzler> Is there a way to do AirPlay from PulseAudio?
[06:34] <Dualboot> no luck on holding shift either on the dual boot setup
[06:34] <Dualboot> ugh
[06:35] <utf2> ActionParsnip:  it says "First, open software center. Click on 'edit' and then 'software sources' to open the software sources window."
[06:35] <utf2> where is "edit"?
[06:35] <rinzler> utf2: if you hover over the top bar, it'll show up
[06:36] <Dualboot> when i tried booting with easy bcd it instantly brought me to grub4dos. what the heck
[06:36] <hexstatik> oops, i just disabled unity, how do i enable it?
[06:36] <rinzler> not the top bar of the window, but the very top bar
=== magn3ts_ is now known as magn3ts
[06:37] <Dualboot> this has been a nightmare install
[06:37] <hexstatik> i was messing around in compiz and there was a conflicting freature in compiz and i thought it would just disable that particular part of unity but it disabled the whole thing, how do i enable unity?
[06:38] <ActionParsnip> utf2: I'd just go for the file. You can run:  gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list      and use the text editor, rather than terminal
[06:38] <utf2> ActionParsnip: did what the page says, found the edit thing
[06:38] <utf2> run the install command again for chrome?
[06:39] <ActionParsnip> utf2: you'll need to run:  sudo apt-get update    to read the new sources you added
[06:39] <ActionParsnip> utf2: then yes, rerun the install chrome deb file command and then the:  sudo apt-get -f install
[06:39] <utf2> doing it now
[06:40] <Dualboot> ActionParsnip: would i have to change the install at all if i am in a new uefi motherboard?
[06:40] <utf2> sudo apt-get -f install is alredy part of the install command
[06:40] <rinzler> Is there a way to do airplay from pulseaudio?
[06:41] <ActionParsnip> Dualboot: I've not used uefi, so no idea. Sorry
[06:41] <utf2> ActionParsnip: same thing is happening... wow
[06:41] <ActionParsnip> utf2: cool, even better :)
[06:41] <ActionParsnip> utf2: why wow?
[06:41] <utf2> because i thought t would work this time
[06:41] <Dualboot> this is so stressfull
[06:42] <ActionParsnip> utf2: can you run:   gedit /etc/apt/sources.list     and show us the file you have using the pastebin
[06:42] <utf2> it wasn't a shot at you or anything, i'm just stunned that i can't even get a browser installed
[06:42] <ActionParsnip> utf2: you can, you just have some package sources disabled. Once you get them enabled you are fine
[06:42] <utf2> this is all i get when i run that deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu quantal main universe restricted multiverse
[06:43] <ActionParsnip> utf2: can you pastebin the sources.list file please
[06:44] <utf2> hm?
[06:44] <ActionParsnip> utf2: I assume you saved the file after you editted it and closed gedit
[06:44] <utf2> that's all that came up when I ran that command
[06:44] <ActionParsnip> utf2: the pastebin website you used earlier, use that to show us the content of the file
[06:45] <utf2> the parent directory and all that?
[06:45] <utf2> i don't follow
[06:45] <livefree424> hello how is everyone...i need some help getting audio out with hdmi i have tried different things to get it to work to no avail anyone know what to do???
[06:45] <kdns> action: he's done `echo *a deb string* > ....sources.list' instead of >>, and overwritten the file.
[06:45] <ActionParsnip> utf2: ok, lets make this easier. run:  sudo apt-get install pastebinit; pastebinit /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:45] <ActionParsnip> kdns: lets see
[06:45] <ActionParsnip> utf2: what is the output?
[06:46] <kdns> hahaha exactly what i was just typing. love that tool!
[06:46] <ActionParsnip> kdns: I love how it accepts streams too :)
[06:46] <ActionParsnip> kdns: even cooler to pipe to xclip
[06:46] <Spindel> Fuck... My server got some bus error while in ssh and now sudo reboot doesn't work, what to do?
[06:46] <Spindel> im still in ssh
[06:47] <ActionParsnip> Spindel: show about:  sudo shutdown -r now
[06:47] <utf2> want me to pastebin what i got?

[06:50] <cub> dont feel like upgrading because the gui is ugly
[06:50] <utf2> ActionParsnip: ppermssion denied
[06:50] <b0tm1nd> You can get used to it..
[06:50] <ActionParsnip> cub: you don't have to use Unity
[06:51] <ActionParsnip> cub: Gnome+Unity is not the only GUI in Precise
[06:51] <cub> yeah but still don't really want to upgrade, i'm low on disk space anyways
[06:51] <ActionParsnip> utf2: ok, run:   cd $HOME; wget https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/quantalsources.list

[06:51] <cub> thats alright, i was using Windows 98 as recent as 2009 lol
[06:51] <ActionParsnip> cub: no updates and no support here
[06:52] <ActionParsnip> utf2: did it download?
[06:52] <b0tm1nd> Flash in Chrome works great but in FF absolutely not!
[06:52] <cub> np, google solves most of my issues :) but ty for letting me kow
[06:52] <cub> know*
[06:52] <ActionParsnip> utf2: then run:  sudo mv ~/quantalsources.list /etc/apt/sources.list
[06:52] <ActionParsnip> cub: no worries
[06:52] <utf2> yes, sorry had to deuce
[06:52] <livefree424> no thoughts anyone?????
[06:53] <ActionParsnip> livefree424: if you run 'sound' in dash, is the right device selected as output? if you run alsamixer are all levels cranked and unmuted? If you then press F6 is it the right device selected
[06:54] <utf2> sudo mv ~/quantalsources.list /etc/apt/sources.list didn't do anything after the first one downloaded

[07:02] <livefree424> so like alsamixergui

[07:04] <Spindel> What to do when Ubuntu can't find sudo?
[07:06] <chris619> hello
[07:06] <olegb> Spindel: use full path /usr/bin/sudo ?
[07:06] <Getterac7> Spindel: if you don't have sudo, use "su" to switch to root user.
[07:06] <kdns> Spindel: try 'su bash', in a terminal, what happens?
[07:06] <Getterac7> Spindel: then try reinstalling sudo through apt-get or whatever.
[07:06] <utf2> welp, since my lifeline left i may as well quit
[07:06] <kdns> utf2: chill
[07:06] <utf2> no clue what to do from here
[07:07] <utf2> i'm not mad
[07:07] <Spindel> kdns: su: command not found
[07:07] <kdns> utf2: i have a few minutes to spare here
[07:07] <kdns> Spindel: what did you change?
[07:07] <Spindel> su bash
[07:07] <somsip> Spindel: what system are you on...your own PC or a server of some kind?
[07:07] <utf2> the reason i say i'm going to quit is because you've been out of the loop and it's a shitton to catch up on
[07:07] <Spindel> ubuntu server
[07:07] <somsip> Spindel: hosted where?
[07:08] <Spindel> somsip: co-location
[07:08] <olegb> Spindel: you f* up your $PATH ?
[07:08] <Spindel> i believe i got some bus error
[07:08] <somsip> Spindel: so hosted? Maybe you don't have access to su/sudo...
[07:08] <Spindel> somsip: no, co-location = my server
[07:08] <Spindel> i own it
[07:08] <Spindel> probably nginx upload progress did some shit that locked the system or something
[07:08] <Spindel> but im still in ssh
[07:09] <Spindel> but can't do shit
[07:09] <kdns> Spindel: log in as root.
[07:09] <Spindel> kdns: how?
[07:09] <somsip> !language | Spindel
[07:09] <ubottu> Spindel: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[07:09] <Getterac7> Spindel: just "su"
[07:09] <Spindel> Getterac7: doesnt work, cant find command
[07:09] <Spindel> su: command not found
[07:09] <Getterac7> Spindel: then someone disabled your super user control.
[07:09] <somsip> Spindel: echo $PATH
[07:10] <chris619> how can i move the launcher to the buttom?
[07:10] <somsip> chris619: you can't
[07:10] <utf2> gonna go look for help somewhere else for now, thans
[07:10] <Getterac7> somsip: that sucks... you could in like v10.x and v11.x :(
[07:11] <somsip> Getterac7: are you talking about unity or another window manager?
[07:11] <Spindel> somsip: /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
[07:11] <Getterac7> somsip: when i was using Gnome2 i could put the launcher/start/task bar where ever i wanted.
=== atrius is now known as atrius_away
[07:12] <somsip> Getterac7: I have no idea about gnome. I am aware that unity can't be moved, and I assumed you meant that. I was wrong
[07:12] <olegb> Spindel: Chech if sudo is in /usr/bin and check if it has the right permissions
[07:12] <kdns> Spindel: Did this ever work, or was it like this as soon as you installed?
[07:12] <skp1> Getterac7: http://www.unixmen.com/move-unity-launcher-to-the-bottom-with-unity-bottom-launcher-ppa-ubuntu/
[07:12] <Getterac7> somsip: i haven't touched Ubuntu since they switched to Unity, so that explains it.
[07:13] <somsip> Spindel: ls /usr/bin  - is sudo in there?
[07:13] <somsip> Getterac7: k - not sure what you can/can't do with gnome2 though
[07:13] <Spindel> kdns: This stopped working when i uploaded a file to my server via website
[07:13] <vitaliko> hello, while messing with compiz i accidently disabled unity. Tried restarting it but no worky :/
[07:13] <Spindel> probably nginx progress module crashed something
[07:13] <Spindel> somsip: I cant use ls
[07:13] <vitaliko> can anyone help
[07:13] <Spindel> doesnt work
[07:13] <Spindel> but sudo is there
[07:14] <Getterac7> Spindel: how do you know sudo is there if you can't ls ?
[07:14] <Spindel> the server works after psycically reboot
[07:14] <somsip> Spindel: on what evidence do you base that? Whoi setup the server for you? Are you sure you are not in a restricted bshell?
[07:14] <Spindel> i got this problems after i upgraded nginx and nginx upload progress module
[07:15] <Spindel> it will work after reboot
[07:15] <Spindel> but crash again when someone uploads a file via http website
[07:15] <kdns> ahhh
[07:15] <vitaliko> typing from terminal now, can someone help me please
[07:15] <kdns> so in fact, it works fine, until you upload a file
[07:15] <Spindel> but dunno how i can reboot the server via ssh :( this sucks
[07:15] <Spindel> yes
[07:15] <thec4ke> shutdown -r now?
[07:16] <Getterac7> Spindel: you can do a reboot over ssh with shutdown -r
[07:16] <Getterac7> yeah.
[07:16] <Getterac7> you have to have admin access to shutdown though, rofl.
[07:16] <BAT-21> Okay, so I finally got my IRCd working properly. I think. . .Would anybody be interested in checking it out. Send me a personal message if so, please.
[07:16] <Spindel> shutdown: command not found
[07:16] <thec4ke> sudo shutdown -r now
[07:16] <thec4ke> done. and done.
[07:16] <Getterac7> he can't sudo
[07:16] <Spindel> i cant use sudo
[07:16] <Getterac7> and can't su
[07:16] <thec4ke> youre screwed
[07:16] <thec4ke> sry :\
[07:16] <Spindel> yeah :(
[07:16] <chris619> how can i move the launcher to the buttom?
[07:17] <vitaliko> can someone help me to reactivate unity please?
[07:17] <thec4ke> is this your server?
[07:17] <chris619> seriously?
[07:17] <chris619> thats such a pain
[07:17] <BAT-21> my dkstop
[07:17] <kdns> call your colo host and have them power cycle it, disable nginx, contact nginx for fix.
[07:17] <Spindel> kdns: yes, that's what i will do
[07:17] <kdns> chris619: you already got your answer scroll up.
[07:17] <Spindel> i will try older version of nginx
[07:17] <Spindel> prop shouldnt take latest stable
[07:18] <chris619> kdns: thats stupid
[07:18] <kdns> chris619: pardon?
[07:18] <somsip> chris619: so what version are you running?
[07:18] <chris619> kdns: whats the reason for users not beign able to move the launcher?
[07:18] <Getterac7> chris619: sounds like you need to install a package to put it on the bottom.
[07:18] <chris619> Someguy123: 12.10
[07:19] <chris619> Getterac7: which packge?
[07:19] <Getterac7> *cough*This is why i don't Unity*cough*

[07:19] <chris619> Getterac7: tried that. doesnt exist
[07:19] <kdns> vitalko: unity --reset
[07:20] <BAT-21> UNITY www.youtube.com/watch?v=toAEQTsidvg
[07:20] <Getterac7> chris619: dunno what to tell you then :(  I can't stand Unity so i switched to a sub-version of Ubuntu...
[07:20] <kdns> chris619: sorry I don't use unity. I wasn't trying to discuss why you need a PPA to install some jazz just to put it at the bottom, just wanted to be sure you knew that it was possible (even if it is so difficult it's stupid!). I use KDE.
[07:21] <somsip> chris619: the only links I see to that are old (11.10) and I don't hear of any way to move unity now.
[07:21] <chris619> damn
[07:22] <chris619> wondering if i should have stuck with mint
[07:22] <Getterac7> chris619: i can only suggest to switch to Kubuntu / xubuntu / fuduntu / mint /...
[07:23] <Getterac7> or switch to KDE or whatever and uninstall Unity
[07:26] <rypervenche> Getterac7: What's fuduntu?
[07:26] <Getterac7> rypervenche: Ubuntu with Gnome2
[07:26] <Getterac7> basically Ubuntu before they switched to Unity.
[07:26] <Kartagis> chris619: you should be able to just drag and drop
[07:27] <rypervenche> OH! FUD, gotcha.
[07:27] <Kartagis> chris619: or right click
[07:27] <hexstatik> knds: unity --reset doesnt work in 12.10
[07:27] <chris619> karakedi: what?!
[07:27] <thec4ke> keep in mind fuduntu is rpm based
[07:27] <Getterac7> rypervenche: and it includes some handy licensed stuff like Flash, MP3, and other helpful stuff like  VLC, Steam, etc etc
[07:27] <Muphrid> Fuduntu is a Fedora fork
[07:27] <hexstatik> but i was able to get unity by type startx from termnial
[07:28] <Muphrid> doesnt have anything to do with the ubuntu codebase
[07:28] <Getterac7> Muphrid: ah ok.  It ended in -untu so i just made the guess.
[07:29] <Muphrid> Getterac7: the project goal was to produce a midterm between fedora and ubuntu hence the name
[07:29] <Muphrid> but the base is Fedora
[07:29] <Getterac7> Muphrid: ah ok. Thanks for the info
[07:30] <thec4ke> if you want ubuntu with gnome 2 mint mate should make you happy
[07:30] <claudia> Hi
[07:31] <Getterac7> thec4ke: i hear mint is good.  I do want to give it a go soon.
[07:31] <claudia> I have a question about grub. Any takers
[07:31] <Muphrid> claudia: Ask
[07:31] <thec4ke> its basically ubuntu with a unique panel and nonfree apt sources enabled by default
[07:32] <Getterac7> all ears
[07:32] <claudia> I enter gedit /ect/default/grub into a terminal and edited the timeout
[07:32] <claudia> I saved and closed the window but when I typed gedit /ect/default/grub again into the terminal it brings up an dempty edit window
[07:33] <reaga> hey
[07:33] <Muphrid> claudia: /etc/default.d/grub.d/ is a directory, you configure grub in /boot/grub/grub.cfg , but i dont know about the timeout
[07:33] <reaga> how do i see how much ram im using on UBUNTU
[07:33] <sara_ubuntu_> hi room
[07:34] <OerHeks> claudia, did you use sudo ? >> sudo /ect/default/grub
[07:34] <reaga> im brand new to ubuntu how do i see ram
[07:34] <b[o]rg> anyone here know of a good web crawler or indexer?
[07:34] <reaga> what do i press
[07:34] <b[o]rg> I just want to get a listing from a website and see where the links go
[07:34] <sara_ubuntu_> hi reaga here u go http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=check%20ram%20ubuntu&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDEQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberciti.biz%2Ffaq%2Fcheck-ram-in-ubuntu%2F&ei=8G7uUOmQIcz14QS7yYBo&usg=AFQjCNEUCgutI4I_Uzg7mXQqPjQ3uMOvvg&bvm=bv.1357700187,d.bGE
[07:34] <OerHeks> * sudo gedit /ect/default/grub
[07:34] <Getterac7> reaga: basically Linux uses as much ram as possible, so all of it.
[07:34] <b[o]rg> i dont want to download or mirror the site
[07:34] <reaga> Getterac7: i have 16GB though
[07:34] <Muphrid> reaga: top or atop in the command line, gnome-system-monitor in a graphical interface
[07:34] <b[o]rg> just to get some index data, see where the links go
[07:34] <reaga> actually ive only allowed 3.5GB into the ubuntu machine
[07:35] <Getterac7> reaga: Linux doesn't let ram go to waste, so it will use all of it for buffers and such.  So it basically always uses all of your ram.
[07:35] <claudia> Yes sudo gedit /ect/default/grub
[07:35] <sara_ubuntu_> require help , grub does not load my other linux saved in /media/7c7ce0b0-5b88-4e4c-bb84-c99c0fc7f387
[07:35] <reaga> Getterac7: a buffer for what?
[07:36] <thec4ke> are you actually typing sudo gedit /ect/default/grub
[07:36] <thec4ke> cause theres a type there :p
[07:36] <Muphrid> etc:)
[07:36] <claudia> sudo gedit /ect/default/grub both times
[07:36] <thec4ke> try changing ect to etc
[07:36] <claudia> just brings up an empty list now
[07:37] <OerHeks> claudia, and did you run update? update-grub
[07:37] <Getterac7> reaga: don't worry about what a buffer is... just don't worry about how much ram Ubuntu is using.
[07:37] <reaga> maybe is houldve used a smaller linux distribution
[07:37] <reaga> ubuntu seems slow
[07:37] <reaga> and laggy
[07:37] <reaga> real bad
[07:37] <thec4ke> reaga: are you runnign in a vm
[07:37] <reaga> yeah
[07:37] <b[o]rg> i want to index the onion websites and see what .onion addresses it discoveres
[07:38] <OerHeks> claudia,  see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Configuring_GRUB_2
[07:38] <Getterac7> reaga: ubuntu isn't small and fast... you might want to switch to xubuntu or something.
[07:38] <claudia> Oh I think I did type ect instead of etc. Let me try that
[07:38] <thec4ke> unity uses graphical accelerating extensive,ly
[07:38] <thec4ke> acceleration*
[07:38] <reaga> ok how do i disable it
[07:38] <thec4ke> try using lxde instead
[07:38] <sara_ubuntu_> require help , grub does not load my other linux saved in /media/7c7ce0b0-5b88-4e4c-bb84-c99c0fc7f387
[07:38] <kunji> reaga: using Lubuntu instead should make things a bit snappier
[07:38] <reaga> its too late now
[07:38] <thec4ke> nah
[07:38] <thec4ke> its easy
[07:38] <reaga> nah
[07:39] <thec4ke> gimme a sec ill show you how
[07:39] <reaga> you dont understand
[07:39] <reaga> im lazy
[07:39] <kunji> You can still change the GUI, just do what thec4ke says
[07:39] <b[o]rg> just to get some index data, see where the links go
[07:39] <Getterac7> hehe
[07:39] <b[o]rg> i dont want to download or mirror the site
[07:39] <claudia> That worked. can't beloeve it was a simple typo
[07:39] <OerHeks> claudia, have fun
[07:41] <Getterac7> So anyone have ideas on multiseat with one monitor?
[07:41] <thec4ke> reaga: first do sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop
[07:41] <thec4ke> then follow this to remove the unity clutter:
[07:41] <thec4ke> http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purelubuntu
[07:41] <thec4ke> might wanna make sure lxde works before removing unity
[07:42] <reaga> nah ill just backup my VM
[07:42] <reaga> clone it
[07:42] <reaga> only take 10 secs
[07:42] <reaga> i love vms
[07:43] <claudia> that worked great, kept getting Display setting is wrong everytime go to Ubuntu since grub sets it at 600x400 at install. At least Ubuntu Studio does.
[07:44] <sara_ubuntu_> any help on how to add installation to grub?
[07:44] <claudia> changed my timeout and display setting
[07:44] <refd> Hi
[07:44] <nanun> Hello
[07:44] <refd> Have a nice day
[07:45] <Krambiorix> ok, i deleted some files with rm , can i have them back ?
[07:45] <refd> What is your file system?
[07:46] <Krambiorix> refd, ext3
[07:47] <refd> You can use ext3grep.
[07:47] <reaga> thec4ke: so its all the same except the ui is faster?
[07:47] <thec4ke> reaga: basically
[07:48] <thec4ke> the gnome tools arent default anymore but theyre still available
[07:48] <reaga> thec4ke: what eles is diferent
[07:48] <reaga> oh
[07:48] <reaga> not default?
[07:48] <reaga> hmm
[07:48] <reaga> this may be problematic
[07:48] <FloodBot1> reaga: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[07:48] <thec4ke> well what od you need
[07:48] <reaga> i just need a router
[07:48] <reaga> i want touse ubuntu as a router
[07:48] <thec4ke> nono
[07:48] <thec4ke> the graphical tools
[07:48] <thec4ke> are different
[07:49] <thec4ke> all the command line stuff is the same
[07:49] <reaga> ok i dont care
[07:49] <reaga> ok
[07:49] <thec4ke> kernel, packages, etc
[07:49] <thec4ke> all youve changed is the desktop environment
[07:49] <BAT-21> Oh well. Nevermind. I got somebody to test out my IRC server and it's working perfectly now. Was firewalled but now it's good and port forwarded.
[07:49] <claudia> Whats it everyone's opinion on ext4. read some things dated a year ago implying to ext4 being unstable
=== Teufelchen_ is now known as Teufelchen
[07:50] <claudia> most installs default to ext4 now and not ext3
[07:50] <thec4ke> reaga: are you  trying to  route over a cable modem?
[07:50] <Getterac7> claudia: i wouldn't touch ext4.  Too buggy.
[07:51] <jellow> does ftp use md5 sums on files by default , I'm getting a lot of corrupt files of my server not quite sure where I'm going wrong ?
[07:51] <claudia> Can a file system on an already installe Ubuntu be changed to ext3?
[07:51] <claudia> from ext4 back to ext3?
[07:51] <cache_za> isnt ext4 default in ubuntu?
[07:51] <cache_za> and fedora
[07:52] <claudia> was when I instaled Ubuntu Studio
[07:52] <Church> jellow: i'd check server logs if there isn't some fs corruption and also client side
[07:52] <claudia> defaulted to ext4
[07:52] <OerHeks> claudia, no, filesystem cannot be up/downgraded.
[07:52] <kunji> Getterac7: You really consider Ext4 too buggy still?  I haven't had any issues with it and I started using it as soon as it was in stable versions of ubuntu.
[07:52] <Getterac7> claudia: you can't swap your current file system as far as i know.
[07:52] <reaga> thec4ke: whats cable
[07:52] <Church> kunji: i had few issues with ext4 when used on live migrated VM in citrix xenserver
[07:52] <kunji> Getterac7: Well, you can... copy everything to another disk, reformat, copy everything back...
[07:53] <claudia> OerHeks, just asking becuase I changed a windows Fat32 to NTFS years ago.
[07:53] <claudia> Hoped it was possible
[07:53] <Getterac7> kunji: i've been happy with XFS for years.  I don't see any reason to switch, and i remember reading about possible corruption a year or so ago.
[07:53] <jellow> Church: They are fine on the server must be fs corruption client side of some sorts
[07:53] <kunji> Church: sounds like a VM bug, I get lots more of those than filesystem issues.
[07:53] <qbitza>  /msg NickServ identify qbitza
[07:54] <cache_za> :/
[07:54] <qbitza> crud
[07:54] <Getterac7> kunji: can you reformat a mounted OS drive?
[07:54] <Church> jellow: that's more probable. as ftp uses tcp, not udp, i doubt it's transmission issue. though if transfer gets interrupted and client resumes in some fucked up way, who knows
[07:54] <kunji> Getterac7: It was more than a year ago, was extremely rare, and has been fixed.  XFS if fine though, I'm not saying you need to switch.
[07:54] <kunji> Getterac7: no
[07:55] <Getterac7> kunji: ah ok, i figured it had been fixed... i'll just let ext4 solidify a bit, lol.
[07:56] <claudia> Hear you can go from NTFS back to fat32, not sure who would want to , but more difficult
[07:56] <jellow> Church: Perhaps rsync would work over ftp like it does over ssh need to check thanks for you help
[07:56] <Getterac7> claudia: yeah, that doesn't sound like a great move.
[07:56] <Getterac7> unless you require fat32 for some specific thing that can't read ntfs
[07:56] <kunji> claudia: fat32 works better for a lot of small storage media
[07:57] <claudia> small storage media being what specifically?
[07:57] <chris619> what irc clients are you all using?
[07:57] <kunji> sdcards, usb flashdrives
[07:57] <claudia> Oh yeh they are usually formatted fat32
[07:57] <claudia> not sure why though
[07:58] <claudia> WHy its better for them
[07:58] <kunji> I think it has to do with how the sectors are layed out, but it's been a few years since I read about it.
[07:59] <claudia> I was going to use fat32 for music and video files 3-4 years ago but Linux reads NTFS so well now there no longer is a reason for a NAS or anything
[07:59] <Getterac7> claudia: fat32 has no journaling... it's faster and puts less wear on the drive as far as i understand.
[07:59] <chris619> xchat irssi or other?
[07:59] <Getterac7> i've used irssi over ssh which worked fine.
[08:00] <claudia> Yeh, I thought journaling could be turned off on an NTFS if need be?
[08:00] <Getterac7> claudia: probably can be, but i don't recall how.
[08:02] <claudia> Well, I'm gonig to reboot and see if I get the display setting error popup when logging back into Ubuntu
[08:03] <NuSuey> ah, finally got my Ubuntu, Mac OS Lion, Windows 7, Windows XP .. (quad boot) working .. wohoo ;) love ubuntu
[08:03] <claudia> Not even sure why Grub would default to 600x400. My display or probably anyones these days will display that low of a setting.
[08:03] <claudia> Mine won't do any lower than 800x600
[08:04] <claudia> Way to go NySuey
[08:04] <Getterac7> claudia: try grub2?
[08:04] <claudia> I am working on the same thing. Any tips
[08:04] <claudia> I thought Ubuntu Studio used Grub2
[08:04] <claudia> Not sure though
[08:05] <Getterac7> oh i have no idea.. Grub 1 was default last time i messed with Ubuntu.
[08:05] <magic> Is there a channell command for C++?
[08:06] <claudia> NuSuey, I have been working on a quad boot but have Windows 7, XP, Vista and Linux and thinking about OSX
[08:06] <Getterac7> magic: ##C++ i think is the C++ channel?
[08:07] <magic> Nope, it doesn't work at least on freenode :)
[08:08] <NuSuey> claudia: love my mac os on my pc :) still not sure if I like Linux/Ubuntu more or MAC OS.  Both are awesome (and much better than the WINSH..) but most of the time I'm in Ubuntu.

[08:12] <ikonia> digger3: dhcp ?

[08:14] <digger3> ikonia: yeah
[08:14] <tripelb> Directory names/ folder names for the last "file names"
[08:15] <tripelb> It is on the site not a person. I figured that wanted testers.

[08:47] <kunji> jil: It's always possible that a range of ips got blocked because of a heavy number of hacking attempts from an area, but it could just as easily be your local ISPs.  If you have trouble getting images, there are other mirrors and you can also get it via torrenting.
[08:48] <jil> zvacet yes I can browse, it only some download that don't start and it's the important ones ;

[08:54] <krzkrz> where am i supposed to put export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[01;34m\] \w \$\[\033[00m\] '
[08:54] <kracekumar> where can I download ubuntu for tablets ?
[08:54] <krzkrz> in ~/.bashrc ?
[08:54] <jil> zvacet, I don't understand why I should change my source server. I have downloading problem with sourceforge.net today
[08:56] <Thor^^> krzkrz: yes
[08:57] <krzkrz> Thor^^, doesnt work
[08:57] <jil> I don't get it really.  Today and yesterday my wine installation get stuck on a dowload from sourceforge.net  the first file (a font) is downloaded allright but the second download does not start.  I have everything up to date and it's a fresh install.
[08:57] <krzkrz> my colors dont reflect
[08:57] <livefree424_> hello all
[08:58] <Thor^^> krzkrz: that export is green user + hostname and blue prompt at the end
[08:58] <Thor^^> krzkrz: make sure you have added it to the end of your .bashrc and that you have sourced it
[08:58] <krzkrz> oh to the end
[08:59] <Thor^^> krzkrz: default ubuntu bashrc contains a variable called force_color_prompt
[09:00] <Thor^^> krzkrz: if you uncomment that line in your .bashrc, it will turn on colored prompt that way as well
[09:00] <Thor^^> krzkrz: if you want another color, then you either replace the PS1 there or add a new one at the bottom
[09:00] <zvacet> jil: well maybe it is your ISP I don´t know

[09:03] <reaga> Thor^^: mkdir /opt/hma
[09:03] <reaga> thats all i typed
[09:03] <zvacet> thegrayrace: if it is installed then justtype name in dash and click on icon  :)
[09:03] <Thor^^> reaga: try sudo infront of it
[09:03] <thegrayrace> but my problem is it's not installed
[09:04] <thegrayrace> and this thing says it should be
[09:04] <reaga> oh it worked i think
[09:04] <MonkeyDust> thegrayrace  sudo apt-get install audacious, or use the software center
[09:04] <reaga> cool
[09:04] <zvacet> thegrayrace: check in software center is it installed or not
[09:05] <Thor^^> reaga: most directories outside ~(your home) require root access to alter them
[09:05] <thegrayrace> thanks, what was the command to update everything again?

[09:29] <JohnWHSmith>  /exit

[09:29] <Snowie> zvacet: any idea where?
[09:30] <krzkrz> tryin it out hexstatik

[09:30] <hexstatik> ala quake
[09:31] <krzkrz>  hexstatik does it have sessions?
[09:31] <hexstatik> yes
[09:31] <Snowie> Hmmm,if i just do this for each folder it should work for me right? sudo chown plex * -R
[09:32] <Snowie> what is * -R, that looks like its for individual files, not folders.
[09:32] <zvacet> Snowie: no idea never tried that
[09:33] <Snowie> what will be the name of the group that has access to my files and folders? will it just be my username?
=== Albastos is now known as Albastos|off
[09:34] <zvacet> Snowie: I think that mean recursively so it is for all files in folder correct me if I´m wrong
[09:34] <Eagleman> llutz its a resident ip address, but i didnt changed for like a half year,  grep mydestination /etc/postfix/main.cf shows eagleman.net
[09:34] <Snowie> zvacet: i agree completley. the issue would be having to do that every time a add a new file to the folder

[09:41] <Layke> For months I would run some script that would add some repository and install some packages. It seems now that it stops and waits for input.. Has "apt-add-repository ppa:some-package/ppa" always required you to confirm?
[09:42] <llutz> Eagleman: the domain is mydestination and it is a real user, so  why should "virtual.db" being used for him?

[09:43] <Eagleman> llutz so its an alias?
[09:44] <llutz> Eagleman: no, its a real existing user your mailserver accepts mail for

[09:48] <Eagleman> for example i want to recieve mail on the domain @eagleman.net
[09:48] <Eagleman> but not on @jrpoot.eu
[09:49] <Eagleman> Maybe it should be more virtual, but then i still want to use the pam users and passwords, so users dont run around with different passwords and usernames
[09:49] <llutz> Eagleman: add "check_recipient_access hash:/etc/postfix/disabled" to your smtpd_recipient_restrictions, and add something like "jrpoot@eagleman.net 554 User unknown" for each user into /etc/postfix/disabled, then run "postmap /etc/postfix/disabled" and "postfix reload"

[10:14] <Mogashi> Ben64: Ok :)
[10:14] <badreligion> evidently it downloaded and installed but it's not in themes in the appearance settings
[10:14] <MonkeyDust> badreligion  use 'advanced settings'

[10:15] <lhavelund> Welcome! :)
[10:15] <MonkeyDust> badreligion  find it in the software center
[10:15] <bobweaver> badreligion,  type "appearance"  in you dash then choose you theme after opening it up
[10:16] <badreligion> well i just said i can't find it in the appearance menu
[10:16] <MonkeyDust> badreligion  find it in the software center
[10:16] <badreligion> i'm looking, no luck
[10:16] <bobweaver> badreligion,  http://imagebin.org/242367
[10:17] <bobweaver> badreligion,  see where it says "themes "
[10:17] <badreligion> yes
[10:17] <bobweaver> Is it there ?
[10:17] <Mogashi> How's gaming and graphics drivers on Linux? A couple of years ago I heard of people having problems. (Will still have a copy of Windows installed for most gaming tho.)
[10:17] <badreligion> not to be rude but this is the third time I've said no
[10:18] <dr_willis> Mogashi: depwnds on the game and hardware
[10:18] <badreligion> and it's not in software center
[10:18] <bobweaver> it is ok badreligion  sometimes if talkig to people it is best to use there names , try login in and out so dbus sees everything
[10:18] <badreligion> it just installed and disappeared
[10:18] <bobweaver> badreligion,  what is version of Ubuntu ?
[10:18] <Mogashi> dr_willis: Ok, I have a Geforce 670, do you know if there is good driver support for that one?
[10:18] <MonkeyDust> badreligion  also for the third time: install advanced settings and change the theme there
[10:19] <unreal__> I have the Geforce 620, I'm using the legacy drivers
[10:19] <badreligion> actually i was trying to figure out what the "advanced setting" thing was
[10:19] <dr_willis> mgolisch: try the nvidia drivers in the repos
[10:19] <badreligion> so technically it's not a third time, i'm still on that
[10:19] <badreligion> if i knew what you meant by install advanced settings I'd gladly do it
[10:20] <bobweaver> nvidia just released new "linux "driver  cool stuff doubles preformance (glad linus said eff you yo nvidia got them on the ball )
[10:20] <cache_za> doubles performance?
[10:20] <bobweaver> that is what nvidia says
[10:20] <badreligion> so my only solution thus far is that i installed it and it vanished
[10:21] <MonkWitDaFunk> does the same hardware utilize diffrent drivers depending on OS being booted?
[10:21] <bobweaver> badreligion,  again what is your version of Ubuntu ?  12.04 12.10 ?
[10:21] <badreligion> 12.10
[10:21] <bobweaver> badreligion,  are you sure that it is installed ?
[10:21] <badreligion> i wish he'd explain this install advanced setting thing though
[10:21] <badreligion> yes, i watched iit in terminal
[10:21] <badreligion> but he left me hanging, so
[10:22] <dr_willis> theres several tweak tools that let you change themes also
[10:23] <goto10> Hello Everybody! I wonder if under Gnome, is it possible to have a link to a folder on the desktop? So that when I click on it, I end up in that folder? For example I would like to have a link to /my/music/ on the desktop. So when I click on it, I have nautilus open in /my/music/. I dont want a symlink, because that would send nautilus to /home/user/desktop/mysymlink/
[10:23] <badreligion> look i just want to figure this out, can someone pickup from where monkey left me hanging please?
[10:23] <bobweaver> badreligion,  open terminal and type in            apt-cache  poilcy  delorean-dark-theme-3.6      then use paste in to paste that to use or tell us if it says that it is installed ?
[10:23] <cousteau> After spending a while messing with drivers, now I can't log in.  However I can log in as guest session.  Any help?
[10:23] <Ben64> badreligion: dude. you open software center, search for "advanced settings" and install it
[10:23] <dr_willis> goto10: you can link form folders yes.
[10:23] <bobweaver> cousteau,  what mods/drivers
[10:23] <cousteau> dmesg doesn't work
[10:23] <cousteau> bobweaver: NVidia, installed from their page
[10:23] <goto10> dr_willis: how?
[10:24] <dr_willis> goto10:  ln -s  source destinatiin
[10:24] <badreligion> dude. i just searched it and there's no "advanced settings"
[10:24] <cousteau> "dmesg doesn't work" == "dmesg doesn't show any useful info"
[10:24] <bobweaver> cousteau,  when you get to login screen press alt+ctrl+f1  can you log into tty ?
[10:24] <goto10> dr_willis: that creates a symlink which sends nautilus to /home/user/desktop/name_of_the_symlink/
[10:24] <goto10> dr_willis: i want nautilus to end up at /my/music/
[10:24] <cousteau> bobweaver: yes, I'm on irssi on a TTY right now
[10:24] <Ben64> badreligion: there is
[10:24] <bobweaver> cousteau,  is nouvea loaded ?  lsmod | less
[10:25] <badreligion> is it called "advanced settings"?
[10:25] <Ben64> yep
[10:25] <bobweaver> q to quit that cousteau
[10:25] <badreligion> tweak tool?
[10:25] <cousteau> it's just that when I log in my screen goes black and goes back to the login screen
[10:25] <bobweaver> cousteau,  sounds like 2 drivers are loaded
[10:25] <bobweaver> cousteau,  lsmod | grep nvidia       << anything come back ?
[10:26] <cousteau> bobweaver: only nvidia
[10:26] <badreligion> again, there's no such program that I can see
[10:26] <dr_willis> goto10:  if they go to the same data it shouldent matter
[10:26] <bobweaver> cousteau,  lsmod | grep nouvea        << anything come back ?
[10:26] <bobweaver> er spelling
[10:26] <cousteau> no nouveau driver loaded
[10:26] <cousteau> anyway, as I said, guest session does work
[10:26] <dr_willis> goto10:  you could try a hard lnk also.. with no -s
[10:26] <bobweaver> cousteau,  what version of nvidia-current is installed ?
[10:27] <cousteau> but I can't log in to either XFCE nor LXDE
[10:27] <badreligion> alright, let me retrace my steps here
[10:27] <goto10> dr_willis: it matters because for example i cannot move up from that folder. i would not end up in /my/ but in /home/user/desktop. no, a hardlink would not solve that.

[10:27] <badreligion> I installed the dark theme from this site via terminal: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/12/2-beautiful-dark-themes-for-gtk-36-or.html#uds-search-results
[10:27] <cousteau> 295.something
[10:27] <badreligion> and now, ALL I want to do is find a way to apply the theme I just installed to my ubuntu
[10:27] <bobweaver> cousteau,  you can use psatebinit ?

[10:28] <Ben64> its not rocket surgery
[10:28] <cousteau> bobweaver: however I installed the drivers from an nvidia link
[10:28] <badreligion> nah, i thought it was
[10:28] <bobweaver> cousteau,  also is nouvea installed ?
[10:29] <badreligion> totally. because at this point I thought I was the only one who thought that
[10:29] <MonkeyDust> badreligion  it's cosmetics, skip it and get used to the actual system, first
[10:29] <cousteau> nouveau-firmware: not installed
[10:29] <badreligion> i'd rather just finish what I set out to do
[10:29] <cousteau> bobweaver: NB: I installed the drivers from the NVidia .run binary
[10:29] <Ben64> badreligion: did you look at the link i sent
[10:30] <bobweaver> cousteau,  remove the driver ./nvidia.script.run --uninstall   or something like that and then install the x-orgers ppa
[10:30] <cousteau> maybe I should just uninstall everything nvidia-* from apt-get
[10:30] <badreligion> yes, and I guess our advanced settings are named differently, mine is called tweak tool
[10:30] <bobweaver> cousteau,  you could also try that
[10:30] <badreligion> same subtitle, different tite
[10:30] <bobweaver> cousteau,  that is why I asked you to pastebin so I could see other things that might be installed

[10:32] <bobweaver> badreligion,  might be where it is comming from is far away or server that it is getting it from is slow
[10:33] <badreligion> in the software center?
[10:33] <bobweaver> badreligion,  when adding a ppa you are adding a NEW SOURCE meaning not from UBUNTU
[10:34] <bobweaver> badreligion,  ppa's are from different places I have two local ones at my home. but if WHERE YYOU ARE GETTING PACKAGE is far away then it will take longer

[10:45] <pgp> my brain is fried :(
[10:47] <agsel> can I somehow reset all the configuration in compiz config manager?
[10:49] <dr_willis> agsel: delete the files in.      .config  for compiz settings might do it
[10:49] <dr_willis> there should be a command yto do it also
[10:49] <dr_willis> but it depends on the release of ubuntu
[10:50] <MonkeyDust> agsel  try compiz --reset
[10:50] <agsel> compiz (core) - Error: Screen 0 on display ":0.0" already has a window manager;
[10:50] <dr_willis> reset was for nunity

[10:58] <cousteau> So...  there was a ~/.Xauthority file owned by root
[10:59] <cousteau> What sudo command might have created this ~/.Xauthority?  maybe `sudo startx`?
[10:59] <dr_willis> cousteau: it seems to happwn a lot
[10:59] <cousteau> As a side note, I'm totally going to alias sudo='sudo -H'
[11:00] <dr_willis> sudo withanxapp  can cause issues also
[11:00] <cousteau> oh, by the way, now I completely messed up something and my computer won't boot unless I start in recovery mode and then select continue
[11:00] <cousteau> dr_willis, do you think sudo -H is better?
[11:00] <dr_willis> heh. you are good at breaking things.
[11:00] <cousteau> (this was on TTY, so there was no gksudo)
[11:00] <dr_willis> never used sudo -H
[11:01] <cousteau> why not?
[11:01] <dr_willis> why should i?
[11:01] <cousteau> oh
[11:01] <dr_willis> ive never used it... ;)
[11:01] <cousteau> never useD, not "never use"
[11:01] <MonkeyDust> cousteau  have you been experimenting with root and sudo options? that's the best way to ruin your system

[11:02] <dr_willis> bbl
[11:02] <cousteau> oh, now I have both nvidia and nouveau drivers loaded, wtf
[11:06] <cousteau> sudo -H makes $HOME to be /root instead of /home/me, which I think it's safer and would avoid stuff like the stupid ~/.Xauthority one

[11:15] <cousteau> ok, I completely messed up something
[11:15] <affe_> hello everyone, I can't remove the ecryptfs-utils libecryptfs0 package, I get error code (1), what is this supposed to mean?
[11:16] <cousteau> now my computer doesn't boot unless I boot failsafe mode and then select "resume normal boot"
[11:18] <cousteau> when the computer is booting it ends up freezing:  the screen doesn't display anything (or some text), NumLock doesn't blink when I hit the key, and not even REISUB works
[11:19] <cfhowlett> cousteau: reinstall
[11:19] <cousteau> reinstall is not an option
[11:19] <Ben64> cousteau: its a bit late, but how come you didn't just install nvidia from apt-get/synaptic/software center
[11:19] <cousteau> Ben64, needed CUDA
[11:20] <Ben64> pretty sure cuda works with that
[11:20] <cousteau> well, maybe with the experimental version
[11:20] <Ben64> all versions
[11:20] <cousteau> no
[11:20] <Ben64> yeah.. it did a couple years ago, i'm sure it still does
[11:21] <cousteau> CUDA requires a driver version higher than the one of nvidia-current, at least on my graphics card
[11:21] <cousteau> otherwise the compiled program doesn't work
[11:22] <cousteau> it returns an error code that means that CUDA is not supported

[11:22] <Crazy_Bird> hello guys, i have a big problem. I'm not an expert on Ubuntu or Linux, but I've setup two identical Ubuntu servers. Both used to have access to the network, but one of them now not. I've checked all the phisical network components (cables, routers, switches), I've checked IP availability, I've checked network interfaces are OK (command "lshw -class network") and I've checked /etc/network/interfaces file is OK. What can I do? I sti
[11:23] <Ben64> cousteau: installing nvidia from the website is almost always a bad idea
[11:23] <cousteau> Ben64, I know that
[11:23] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: swap network cables, maybe one is broken
[11:23] <cousteau> now
[11:23] <Ben64> cousteau: :(
[11:23] <RJ3000> and/or switch ports
[11:24] <Crazy_Bird> IRJ3000: I've checked cables, they are OK
[11:24] <RJ3000> how are you assigning them IPs?
[11:24] <Crazy_Bird> Both are fixed IPs
[11:24] <RJ3000> now the same fixed IP hopefully? :)
[11:24] <RJ3000> not*
[11:25] <Crazy_Bird> Oh, no. One is 172.26.0.41 and the other 172.26.0.42
[11:25] <cousteau> ok, now what might be happening?  the only symptom I can check is:  computer freezes when booting, but works when booting in recovery mode and then selecting "continue with normal boot"
[11:25] <cousteau> this is a total freeze that doesn't even let me REISUB
[11:26] <cousteau> hm, if the USB drivers died, it's possible that my USB keyboard isn't able to send a REISUB, right?
[11:26] <Ben64> possible
[11:26] <cfhowlett> cousteau: entirely possible
[11:26] <cousteau> and also that the light doesn't blink when I hit NumLock
[11:26] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: Is there a way to check if all required services in Ubuntu server for networking are ok?
[11:26] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: can you ping your own 172.. ip from the machine that isn't working?
[11:27] <cousteau> damn it, why don't computers have PS/2 connectors anymore?
[11:27] <RJ3000> if ifconfig shows, eg eth0 with your IP and mask set correctly, it's probably ok
[11:27] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: No, I cann't
[11:27] <RJ3000> pastebin your network/interfaces files maybe, in case you missed something?
[11:27] <RJ3000> ah, well that's the first thing then
[11:28] <RJ3000> yeah pastebin both interfaces files
[11:28] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: I'm sorry
[11:28] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: ping to self machine works and ifconfig is OK
[11:29] <cousteau> I uninstalled some nvidia-* packages, might this be causing the kernel to freeze?
[11:29] <Ben64> !text | cousteau: try this
[11:29] <ubottu> cousteau: try this: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[11:30] <cousteau> ok, add "text"
[11:30] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: paste bin output of ifconfig, interfaces, route  commands for both boxes. hard to know where to start

[11:32] <RJ3000> oh wait, nm dont try and type it in if you're not online from it
[11:32] <RJ3000> check dmesg first
[11:32] <RJ3000> dmesg | grep eth0
[11:32] <Baby_me> yeehaw
[11:32] <RJ3000> compare on both machines - what's the difference? <-- Crazy_Bird
[11:36] <intxk> fgh
[11:36] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: no difference between dmesg | grep eth0 on both servers
[11:36] <cousteau> adding text didn't do anything
[11:37] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: hm, so both are reporting the link is ready
[11:37] <RJ3000> both machines are plugged into the same switch?
[11:37] <cousteau> maybe something related to ACPI?  I remember having this problem on the LiveCD
[11:37] <intxk> irc.secfo.org
[11:37] <MonkeyDust> cousteau  still struggling with nvidia?
[11:37] <cousteau> MonkeyDust, nope
[11:37] <cousteau> only with the whole damn kernel now
[11:37] <Kartagis> in cairo-dock, I've accidentally moved pidgin into firefox dock. how can I undo that?
[11:37] <Ben64> cousteau: reinstall : /
[11:38] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: No, not really. Both says IPV6 link is not ready. Anyway, I'm using IPV4, not sure if the answer is ok
[11:38] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: are these new installs of ubuntu? any chance there is a firewall running? sudo iptables -L  should match on both machines
[11:38] <cousteau> MonkeyDust, now the situation is: computer only boots from recovery mode
[11:38] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: yeah ignore ipv6, that sounds ok
[11:38] <cousteau> Ben64, can't; I have some programs installed which would be horrible to reinstall
[11:38] <cousteau> (programs not in repositories)
[11:38] <Ben64> cousteau: like what
[11:38] <cousteau> Xilinx
[11:39] <cousteau> now that I think of it, Xilinx is mostly in /opt, which iirc is on a separate partition
[11:39] <Ben64> never heard of it
[11:39] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: i see this in my dmesg:  ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eth0: link becomes ready
[11:39] <aguitel> i installed minimal xfce ,how launch jockey-gtk ?
[11:40] <Ben64> cousteau: without knowing exactly what got you into this mess, i wouldn't know how to undo it
[11:40] <cousteau> Ben64, yeah, that's my problem too
[11:40] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: Yes, both fresh installs of Ubuntu servers. They were installed at the same time because they are going to be used as high availability servers for a private webapplication.
[11:40] <Ben64> cousteau: you could try pastebinning ~/.bash_history, but it might not contain everything
[11:41] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: Can't see the same text on my dmesg
[11:41] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: are thy plugged into a complex switch/router that was preconfigured, maybe vlan or certain ports are used for something else
[11:41] <RJ3000> try swapping switchports perhaps
[11:41] <RJ3000> assuming you already know cables are fine
[11:42] <RJ3000> maybe try plugging the dodgy server into a laptop or some other network, see if that can be made to work at all
[11:42] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: No, no... they are connected to a simple swith, what is connected to a simple router for access to Internet
[11:42] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: ports are not used for anything else
[11:43] <RJ3000> i would still swap ports just in case, sometimes one port on a switch can go bad
[11:43] <cousteau> Ben64, ok...  I had the Nvidia drivers installed from the CUDA installer, then I installed the driver nvidia-experimental-310 from Additional controllers (without uninstalling Nvidia) and it didn't work, so I manually reinstalled the Nvidia driver.  Same for the nvidia-experimental-304 so I reinstalled Nvidia manually again. (...)
[11:44] <RJ3000> and double check your gateway/netmask are correct in your network/interfaces files
[11:44] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: might be worth booting off a live cd (ubuntu edsktop installer or something) and seeing if you can get the server online that way, to rule out hardware
[11:44] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: I've checked taking out the UTP cable from the server, pluggin it to a laptop with the same network configuration under windows and the laptop works flawlessly
[11:45] <RJ3000> ok
[11:45] <sara_ubuntu_girl> can some1 guide me how to manually/automatically add one installation on disk /dev/sda2 to Grub?
[11:45] <RJ3000> does eth0 appear in ifconfig output?
[11:45] <cousteau> Then x wouldn't start, so I decided to uninstall nvidia-experimental-* and nvidia-settings-experimental-*
[11:46] <sara_ubuntu_girl> Crazy_Bird what seems to be the problem?
[11:46] <RJ3000> ie, does ifconfig eth0  show the addr, and mask you set in the interfaces file
[11:46] <Crazy_Bird> OK. I'm sorry, I've made a mistake
[11:46] <MonkeyDust> sara_ubuntu_girl  you add OS'es to grub, not installations
[11:46] <Crazy_Bird> network card name is not eth0, but p4p1
[11:46] <cousteau> Then X started fine but I couldn't log in due to the damn ~/.Xauthority owned by root.  I thought it was still a conflict so I uninstalled nvidia-current (but not nvidia-common).  Everything I uninstalled was with sudo apt-get purge --purge
[11:47] <sara_ubuntu_girl> MonkeyDust yes i want to add ubuntu 10.04 OS to grub
[11:47] <Burnt_Reynolds> can anyone help me out with an ubuntu 10.04.3 install?
[11:47] <Crazy_Bird> let me see dmesg command in both servers
[11:47] <bekks> Burnt_Reynolds: Just ask.
[11:47] <MonkeyDust> sara_ubuntu_girl  10.04 will soon be !eol, better not struggle with it
[11:48] <Burnt_Reynolds> getting errors in the following log: http://pastebin.com/eSDiV0fR
[11:48] <sara_ubuntu_girl> MonkeyDust my company requires me to use 10.04 only
[11:48] <sara_ubuntu_girl> MonkeyDust how can i force update-grub to check /dev/sda2?
[11:48] <MonkeyDust> sara_ubuntu_girl  in that case: it will be added to grub when you install it
[11:49] <sara_ubuntu_girl> MonkeyDust its already installed , somehow it got removed from grub.cfg
[11:49] <cousteau> Then the system didn't boot, so I booted in recovery mode and selected the "dpkg" option.  Then I found out that recovery + option "continue with normal boot" is the only option that works now
[11:49] <MonkeyDust> sara_ubuntu_girl  ah, so it's a grub repair
[11:49] <sara_ubuntu_girl> MonkeyDust yeah but repair /add from disk /dev/sda2
[11:50] <MonkeyDust> !grub > sara_ubuntu_girl
[11:50] <cousteau> And that's it.  Everything works fine as long as I boot from recovery mode.
[11:50] <ubottu> sara_ubuntu_girl, please see my private message
[11:50] <cousteau> Ben64, did you get that?
[11:51] <Ben64> cousteau: yeah, but still dunno whats causing the problem
[11:51] <Ben64> seems like missing file(s) or permission problem
[11:51] <cousteau> maybe I have to reinstall something related to the kernel
[11:51] <cousteau> Ben64, I don't think it's a permission problem since that wouldn't explain the computer freezing, would it?
[11:52] <sara_ubuntu_girl> MonkeyDust thanks ....but it says use update-grub which i already tried ... but any ways thanks for help . i have seen another url which might help

[11:52] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: until you have debugged, you can do  "sudo ufw disable"

[11:53] <cousteau> Ben64, I'm on xubuntu, actually
[11:53] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: going to try that
[11:53] <Ben64> cousteau: then xubuntu-desktop :)
[11:53] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: and  sudo service networking restart  if you've editing the config files
[11:55] <cousteau> Ben64, it's already installed
[11:55] <cousteau> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1516624/
[11:55] <Ben64> cousteau: oh.. then all the packages that are supposed to be there are there
[11:56] <cousteau> maybe I shouldn't have removed nvidia-current
[11:56] <Burnt_Reynolds> getting these errors in my xorg log can anyone help?: http://pastebin.com/eSDiV0fR
[11:56] <Burnt_Reynolds> please
[11:57] <Ben64> cousteau: you should purge any nvidia packages left
[11:57] <RJ3000> Burnt_Reynolds: Xorg -config  or something (-help) will autogenerate a valid xorg.conf, maybe you need to do that. been a while since i messed with xorg tho
[11:57] <cousteau> Ben64, only nvidia-common remaining
[11:57] <Ben64> cousteau: afterwards i'd reinstall nvidia-current
[11:58] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: I works OK now. I'll check ufw configuration, because it is clear now that is the problem. Thank you very much!!!! If you come to Canary Islands one day, I'll invite you to a beer and a good food!!! :-)
[11:58] <cousteau> Ben64, anything else?
[11:58] <Burnt_Reynolds> RJ: pretty sure i tried that already
[11:58] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: ha, glad you got it sorted :)
[11:58] <{Elvano}> Is it possibleto have both desktop and server installation files on one bootable USK key?
[11:59] <Crazy_Bird> RJ3000: Again, thank you very much, really. Bye
[11:59] <RJ3000> Crazy_Bird: you're welcome, seeya
[11:59] <cousteau> {Elvano}, there was a way to have multiple ISOs in one device, don't remember how
[11:59] <Burnt_Reynolds> RJ3000: is there a irc chan specific to xorg?
[11:59] <cousteau> Burnt_Reynolds, I think there's #xorg
[12:00] <RJ3000> Burnt_Reynolds: probably, they have a website..
[12:00] <minixvm> !alis | Burnt_Reynolds
[12:00] <ubottu> Burnt_Reynolds: alis is a services bot that can help you find channels. Read "/msg alis help list" for help and ask any questions about it in #freenode. Example usage: /msg alis list #ubuntu* or /msg alis list *http*
[12:00] <RJ3000> oh didnt know about alis, neat
[12:00] <nyuszika7h> hi, is there a way to open a terminal on a live media without ttys? not like I couldn't run `DISPLAY=:0 gnome-terminal' on tty1, just wondering if there is another way.
[12:01] <nyuszika7h> (I'm installing ubuntu so I only have the top panel.)
[12:01] <cousteau> nyuszika7h, maybe Ctrl-Alt-T ?
[12:01] <nyuszika7h> ah, nice, thanks
[12:02] <user92223> Problem with Bluetooth manager in Ubuntu LXDE desktop.  The bluetooth file browser uses "thunar" but I want to use "pcmanfm". How to do this?
[12:03] <user92223> Bluetooth Manager says says I should enter an alternative browser in "service settings"  but i can't find it.
[12:03] <{Elvano}> I guess I'mm be overwritting my key for the time being, cousteau. Thank you for the response
[12:04] <cousteau> yw  :)  sorry if it wasn't helpful
[12:04] <cousteau> ok, rebooting
[12:07] <Kartagis> in cairo-dock, I've accidentally moved pidgin into firefox dock. how can I undo that?
[12:09] <cousteau> Ben64, whatever has happened...  everything works now
[12:10] <Ben64> cool
[12:10] <cousteau> Also, I have a hypothesis:  it did work before, but since the damn Nvidia drivers crash the splash screen and I only get a black screen (this is normal), I didn't know what was happening
[12:11] <cousteau> so I panicked, and started tapping NumLock, then tried to REISUB, then gave up and button-reboot
[12:11] <Ben64> thats what a ssh server is for
[12:11] <cousteau> but maybe I just had to wait  :(
[12:13] <cousteau> Ben64, that would involve (1) having openssh-server installed and configured (which I do have), (2a) having my Linux netbook here (which I don't) or (2b) access to any other Linux machine or one with PuTTY (which I neither do), (3) having thought of that (which I didn't)
[12:16] <lexy> hi
[12:16] <Ben64> cousteau: i use my phone as an ssh client :)
[12:17] <cousteau> Ben64, wow!  is there a Java app that allows me to do that via GPRS?
[12:17] <cousteau> I'm the Richard Stallman of smartphones  :|
[12:17] <bekks> cousteau: The used media is irrelevant for the ssh protocol :) Just get an ssh app for your phone.
[12:18] <cousteau> well, there's an IRC thing for old Java dumbphones, so I guess there's also ssh
[12:18] <lexy> hi
[12:19] <Ben64> java? get a smartphone already

[12:20] <lololanylol> Hello, I am trying to reinstall grub, and it says when i run sudo grub-install /dev/sda  Path /boot/grub is not readable by GRUB on boot.  Installation impossible  Aborting,  how do I fix this?
[12:21] <zoie> hello, i'm getting this warning: "WARNING: gnome-keyring:: couldn't connect to: /home/user/.cache/keyring-cORz3c/pkcs11: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type" everytime i "svn" something; is there a way to solve this problem?

[12:25] <FlowRiser> zoie, do you have the os in french ?
[12:25] <zoie> FlowRiser: yes
[12:26] <FlowRiser> zoie, have you tried going manually into that folder and looking for 'svn' ?
[12:26] <dr_willis> lololanylol:   where is your /boot/ partion or directory at?
[12:27] <lololanylol> dev/sda1
[12:27] <lololanylol> wait
[12:27] <lololanylol> i believe its
[12:27] <lololanylol> just   /mnt/boot
[12:28] <dr_willis> lololanylol:  well i imagien it needs to be mounted to /boot/ for reinstalling grub.. or are you on a live cd right now? or what exactly?
[12:28] <lololanylol> its the webserver-root is the problem and its an LVM2 ext4 file system
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[12:28] <lololanylol> yeah I'm on a live CD with Ubuntu secured remix 12.10
[12:28] <dr_willis> I dont  use lvm. so really cant help much more.
[12:29] <lololanylol> i dont use it often either, any other suggestions and how do I mount the boot to boot?
[12:29] <lololanylol> also, have you used boot-repair-disk utility?
[12:30] <dr_willis> I normally use/reccomend that boot-repair tool.
[12:31] <lololanylol> if I select the option  "Repair File System"  will it wipe the data usually?
[12:31] <bekks> lololanylol: "Repair" vs. "Delete".
[12:32] <bekks> lololanylol: Nonetheless, you should have a backup handy.
[12:32] <dr_willis> that wouldebne be much of a reair  - I would guess its doing a fsck
[12:32] <lololanylol> under Advanced Options - select Repair File Systems
[12:32] <dr_willis> If a file system is badly damaged and needs fsck'd there can be data loss.. it could allready have been lost.
[12:33] <lololanylol> yeah I just got done spending 6 hours cloning it to an external
[12:33] <lololanylol> not sure if it worked though
[12:33] <lololanylol> because now I can't see the external as of right now
[12:35] <lololanylol> so basically, when I boot Dr. Willis, it says no OS detected or Installed basically, but i am still able to see everything when i start pulling it up in the LIVE CD
[12:36] <lololanylol> so it makes me think maybe its a grub path issue or something along those lines, but am unsure how to address it
[12:36] <lololanylol> also if this helps, that boot-repair tool, the Grub Tabs are greyed out....
[12:37] <MTsol> Just installed ubuntu and when I go to boot into it I hear the sound of it loading but I never get a picture
[12:37] <minixvm> !nomodeset | MTsol
[12:37] <ubottu> MTsol: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[12:38] <MTsol> thanks
[12:38] <lololanylol> minixvm, have any suggestions for my issue?
[12:38] <dr_willis> If you are using a lvm. ive no idea what problems that may cause. if you had a spare usb flash you could put /boot/ on that and install grub to the mbr of the flash and se eif that works.. but thats about all i can suggest. others may know more about grub and lvms

[12:41] <lexy> can i help here to install Android Apps on UBUNTU 12.40
[12:41] <lololanylol> also, under the MBR options in boot-repair tool   it only gives me SDA (generic MBR) and only able to boot sda5  and not SDA1, but no drop down
[12:41] <minixvm> lexy: android apps are for arm
[12:42] <MTsol> Okay I'm not really understanding the tutorial.
[12:42] <adam_8606> hi, I compiled a simple C file in geany and built it. Then an "application/x-executable" file showed up. How do I run it???
[12:42] <lexy> ok tnx
[12:42] <fego> adam_8606: ./file.out
[12:42] <lololanylol> and how do I unlock the root volume, it says it I dont have the permissions needed to view
[12:43] <MTsol> Where do I type in those commands to fix the black screen?
[12:43] <fego> adam_8606: the compilation might have produced a exexutable file, if you have not specified the output file with -o, the default is "a.out"
[12:44] <adam_8606> fego: the file has just showed up on the desktop as "filename"
[12:45] <adam_8606> fego: when I type "filename" into terminal it says command not fond
[12:45] <MTsol> ...
[12:45] <TakeItEZ> adam_8606: "~/Desktop/filename"
[12:45] <fego> adam_8606: cd ~/Desktop, then run
[12:46] <adam_8606> fego: i already cd'd onto the desktop
[12:46] <fego> then ./filename adam_8606
[12:46] <nydel> having serious trouble trying to do system update / upgrade
[12:46] <dr_willis> You are using Proper Case in the filenames?
[12:46] <fego> make sure the exexutable bits are on adam_8606
[12:47] <lololanylol> bkup
[12:48] <adam_8606> fego: Thanks
[12:48] <aFeijo> hi folks, after a simple reboot, my ubuntu 12.10 x64 wont finish booting. It freeze at the black screen where it say [ OK ] to many things, the last one is: *Checking battery state ... [ OK ] (I'm on a desktop, no battery)
[12:48] <Pinchiukas> What do I do if I forget the root password? Recovery console asks for the password.
[12:48] <fego> adam_8606: no worries, :)
[12:48] <minixvm> nydel: where are you stuck?
[12:48] <nydel> aFeijo: did you try ctrl-alt-backspace? to restart x?
[12:48] <aFeijo> nydel, I rebooted again, no luck
[12:49] <aFeijo> nydel, in ctrl+alt+F5 I can access my shell, what should I look for?
[12:49] <minixvm> !root | Pinchiukas
[12:49] <ubottu> Pinchiukas: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[12:49] <aFeijo> nydel, ctrl+alt+backspace just add [^H to the black screen
[12:49] <nydel> minixvm: well, updates haven't been working. then i tried "dpkg --configure -a" & that gets stuck
[12:50] <minixvm> nydel: have you added any ppas?
[12:50] <mar77i> hmm. can anyone give me a hint on how I could stop ubuntu "blink" on one screen? they are out of sync by having 60.0 and 59.9 set... I tried changing the setting with the dual setup I'm calling xrandr for "xrandr --output DVI-0 --rate 60 --right-of VGA-0 --rate 60" to no effect
[12:50] <nydel> minixvm: probably but nothing too weird.. just firefox nightly, clementine.. i should comment them out of sources & try apt-get?
[12:51] <minixvm> nydel: yes
[12:51] <nydel> where is sources?
[12:52] <minixvm> nydel: /etc/apt
[12:52] <avickery> I have a n00b DNS question, anybody up for it?
[12:52] <s3p> ask
[12:52] <dr_willis> just ask the question. dont ask to ask
[12:53] <aFeijo> what could cause the graphical interface to load up?
[12:53] <nydel> minixvm is the only file in question sources.list?
[12:53] <aFeijo> what could cause the graphical interface to NOT load up?
[12:53] <minixvm> nydel: you might want to check the directory too sources.list.d
[12:54] <nydel> minixvm: E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
[12:54] <picaso> maybe your graphics are not compatible
[12:55] <picaso> or your motherborf aFeijo
[12:55] <minixvm> nydel: what is the output when you run that?
[12:55] <aFeijo> lol, I executed startx and it powered up
[12:55] <aFeijo> wth?
[12:55] <avickery> I installed Ubuntu desktop a while back and then installed each lamp component manually. Worked great.

[12:56] <nydel> minixvm: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1516713/
[12:57] <aFeijo> ok I have the graphical interface, but no sidebar !! :(
[12:57] <Pinchiukas> minixvm: I don't remember if I added a user and if I did. I need root access period.
[12:57] <minixvm> nydel: why are you using root?
[12:57] <picaso> afeijo did you checked your instalation cd it could corupted
[12:58] <nydel> minixvm: sudo -i
[12:58] <aFeijo> picaso, I have this installed for long time, no cd involved
[12:58] <minixvm> nydel: why, not how
[12:58] <picaso> ah ok then maybe is time for a fresh install
[12:59] <nydel> minixvm: oh
[12:59] <Pinchiukas> I forgot the login and password, I have console access. How do I find out the username and password? Or reset the password.
[12:59] <minixvm> Pinchiukas: adding a user is part of the install process, its a mandatory step
[12:59] <dr_willis> look in  /home/ for the users names
[12:59] <nydel> minixvm: dpkg: error: requested operation requires superuser privilege
[13:00] <minixvm> nydel: then run it using your normal user wit sudo
[13:00] <nydel> minixvm: i think that's why, unless you meant something else?
[13:00] <minixvm> nydel: anywho, thats not the issue here
[13:00] <dr_willis> !resetpassword
[13:00] <nydel> minixvm: sure, you mean don't use sudo -i
[13:00] <nydel> minixvm: good advice, my bad
[13:00] <Pinchiukas> minixvm: I don't remember the freaking username!
[13:00] <Pinchiukas> The directory /home is empty.
[13:00] <nydel> minixvm: any idea what's going on with my upgrade?
=== LordDeath_ is now known as LordDeath
[13:01] <minixvm> nydel: try sudo apt-get update then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade again

[13:02] <dagerik> i am no longer able to select text from terminal, and scrollclick to paste it in terminal prompt. can can have caused this?
[13:02] <minixvm> Pinchiukas: if your /home directory is empty then you likely have a big problem
[13:02] <TakeItEZ> Pinchiukas: "cat /etc/issue" says what?
[13:03] <dr_willis> or your home is on a seperate partition

[13:06] <nydel> minixvm: i'm logged in using cinnamon window manager.. do you think this could have anything to do with the problem?
[13:06] <dr_willis> nydel:  you installed cinnamon on ubuntu? using some ppas?
[13:06] <minixvm> nydel: cinnamon is a desktop environment and isn't supported on ubuntu
[13:07] <nydel> that's why i mentioned it.. do you think ubuntu would intentionally break down like that to force me to log in using unity?
[13:07] <dr_willis> nydel: more likely cinimon broke somthing
[13:08] <minixvm> nydel: intentionally break down? you do realise what not supported means?
[13:08] <dr_willis> having lots of ppa's enabled can goof up upgradeng also.
[13:08] <nydel> i meant to write "think CINNAMON would intentionally break down..."
[13:08] <nydel> apologies.
[13:09] <dr_willis> you could always use the ppa-purge stuff and remove cinnamon. but in a system with a confused package state.. that may not work

[13:21] <minixvm> niclas: thats a feature, holding the key shows you shortcuts
[13:21] <niclas> If I bind Super+E to open Home Folder the same thing goes. That means that if I press Super+E quickly it'll open Home Folder and then Dash Home. But if I do it slowly, it'll simply open Home Folder like I want. Can I disable the opening of Dash Home in this scenario?

[13:31] <_Ethan_> hi
[13:34] <_Ethan_> just to let you know to the channel. Yesterday I wanted to install ubuntu 12.10, having the problem that I had ubuntu 10.10, but i did not care to format again, nobody could answer it. The solution is simply to record the iso in a cd, then install it by choosing the option "erase ubuntu 10.10 and install", and no partition need to be made or modified.
[13:34] <_Ethan_> so it is not needed to make all the crap we chatted yesterday

[13:44] <Monotoko> it doesn't support Ubuntu :(
[13:44] <Eagleman> TakeItEZ, setting mydestination=localhost will result in all mail to fail to arrive
[13:44] <lololanylol> if i take a folder say "root" for instance, (with a website) in it do a fresh install, and then replace most of the files including the website folder in the new installation, will it most likely work with minimal to no reconfiguration, or if there is some reconfiguration, what might it consist of?
[13:44] <TakeItEZ> Eagleman: then you haven't configured your virtual-domains correct
[13:45] <TakeItEZ> Eagleman: and it's highly adviced to read postfix documentation if you want to setup a public mailserver
[13:45] <Monotoko> lololanylol: is this website accessed via a domain?
[13:45] <lololanylol> yes
[13:45] <pinnen> Monotoko: http://www.iheartubuntu.com/2012/11/ppa-for-netflix-desktop-app.html
[13:45] <Eagleman> The documentation is a maze, i am better off testing things myself, trial and error
[13:45] <Monotoko> lololanylol: you'll need to set up your virtual servers in apache
[13:45] <pinnen> Monotoko: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/11/how-to-use-netflix-on-ubuntu
[13:45] <Monotoko> thank you pinnen :)
[13:46] <pinnen> Monotoko: absolutely no problem :)
[13:46] <TakeItEZ> Eagleman: trial and error results in a mess and sometimes into a misused system (openrelay)
[13:46] <lololanylol> do I need alamp stack? or is everything included, just need to reconfig, im copying the entire root folder right now which contains the sql files in var/lib and the website files
[13:46] <Monotoko> lololanylol: good... just backup your sites-enabled folder... and any configuration you've done if it's PHP
[13:46] <lololanylol> just have to reconfigure apach again because  its a new machine installation
[13:47] <lololanylol> right?
[13:47] <coraxx> Question... in Ubuntu how does one get a list of windows currently running .... both title of the window and the id ?

[13:57] <Carlinhos> more of a windows question but: i'm planning on doing ubuntu/windows8 (64bit) dual boot. i will only use windows for office and a couple of games (starcraft). how large should my windows partition be?

[13:57] <Pici> Carlinhos: try ##windows
[13:57] <xcat> Permissions are not automatic
[13:58] <xcat> Although they will probably be 700 if you copy /etc/skel to the home dir
[13:58] <sw> xcat If I add a user 'useradd bob' then bob will have permissions for /home/bob? So it's not the same if I specify /srv/backups?

[13:59] <xcat> sw: why not just try it
[13:59] <Eagleman> TakeItEZ, i am running 2-3 FQDN's each with their own users and password ( PAM ) which Postfix Virtual Domain do you suggest using, to split those domains
[13:59] <asteve> cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max says 6949131; I've added the following to /etc/security/limits.conf : "user hard nofile 6949130"l "user soft nofile 6949130" yet every time I login I'm still getting 1024 as my user limit
[13:59] <Baribal> Hi. Is there a command line tool like cfdisk which I can use to resize partitions as with gparted?
[14:00] <xcat> Pici: they're not?
[14:00] <bono> Baribal: parted
[14:00] <sw> Pici So if I do 'adduser backups --home /srv/backups' then backups won't have permission to the folder until I manually do it?
[14:00] <aguitel> how install nvidia-173 in 12.10 ?
[14:00] <bono> Baribal: but it's not like cfdisk ..
[14:01] <Pici> xcat: They both seek to create users. adduser is typically what people want to use unless they want to specify every single little thing about how the user will be setup.
[14:01] <TakeItEZ> Eagleman: split as in?

[14:01] <ubottu> aguitel: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto
[14:01] <Pici> sw: correct
[14:01] <Pici> sw: assuming that /srv/backups existed before your adduser of course.
[14:01] <huang> ^X
[14:01] <Eagleman> TakeItEZ: currently i have shared domains
[14:01] <sw> Pici Then how come when I don't specify --home and the user ends up in /home/$user, it's ok and I don't need to do anything?
[14:01] <sw> Pici No, it doesn't exist.
[14:01] <Eagleman> if i send mail to robin@eagleman.net
[14:01] <Baribal> bono, thanks. Interesting interface. ^^
[14:02] <xcat> sw: Because by default it copies /etc/skel and sets mode 700
[14:02] <Pici> sw: then using adduser will assign the proper permissions then.
[14:02] <Eagleman> it also arrives on robin@jrpoot.eu
[14:02] <sw> Pici Thanks, that's all I wanted to know!
[14:02] <sw> 8-)
[14:03] <xcat> On CentOS you can specify -m or --create-home to create it

[14:04] <TakeItEZ> helpings: you're missing a pipe | before awk. but awk doesn't need grep and both nearly never need cat.
[14:05] <lesshaste> can you get acroread for ubuntu?
[14:05] <Pici> sw: you should be using adduser, which doesn't have a --base-dir option.
[14:05] <TakeItEZ> helpings: so you could use: awk '!/^#/{print $7}' /etc/fstab           but what do you expect $7 printing? it only has 6 fields

[14:10] <bftdrgv> hi how to use firezilla?
[14:11] <Pici> raven_: the page I linked suggests using sshd's own internal-sftp option.
[14:11] <TakeItEZ> Eagleman: which results in a warnings since missing mydestination let postfix use your domains by default. and this makes them listed twice, once real, once virtual

[14:12] <hiatus> why are ubuntu's icons png's instead of svg's?
[14:12] <adamk> bftdrgv: Exactly what are you trying to do?  filezilla is an (S)FTP client, so you just put in the username, hostname, password, etc, and connect to a remote server.
[14:12] <adamk> bftdrgv: Please keep it in channel.
[14:12] <jnix> around 60-120 seconds.. an alternative is to disable GSSAPIAuthentication and UseDNS=no in sshd_config, wondering if anyone knows what to do with the ssh client rather than change the settings on the ssh server?

[14:25] <wlosio> and my Ubuntu stop work... -.-
[14:25] <wlosio> how to solve this ?
[14:25] <bekks> wlosio: How much RAM do you have?
[14:25] <iceroot> is there a default shortcut on unity to show the desktop/minimize all windows?
[14:25] <wlosio> 4GB / amd64 arch
[14:26] <jnix> any SSH gurus? :)
[14:26] <bekks> jnix: Why?
[14:26] <bekks> wlosio: Thats pretty low for pictures of that size.
[14:26] <iceroot> jnix: #openssh or something like that
[14:26] <Aknot> Is there a way to get exactly same mouse accel/speed as in windows 7?
[14:26] <wlosio> all photos who have more than 20MB i got freez
[14:26] <wlosio> to 20mb is okay
[14:26] <iceroot> jnix: and its always a good idea to post usefull and detailed questions instead of "any foobar"
[14:27] <dave_> which app usare you using to open the tiff?
[14:27] <bekks> wlosio: I'd say you have a "too less RAM"-issue.
[14:27] <jnix> when sshing from ubuntu 12.04 server to my RHEL6 server, its taking me 60+ seconds to reach the login prompt
[14:27] <wlosio> bekks at  old windows 512ram is okay...
[14:27] <iceroot> jnix: should be related to the server
[14:27] <jnix> some googling suggests i need to turn off UseDNS and GSSAPIAuthentication
[14:27] <iceroot> jnix: you can use ssh -vvv
[14:27] <bekks> jnix: Disable DNS resolution in the sshd_config of your server.

[14:27] <jnix> i've got an arch machine, and a couple debian boxes that this doesn't happen with, so it's an ubuntu only thing

[14:28] <iceroot> jnix: use ssh -vvv
[14:28] <jnix> iceroot: http://fpaste.org/V7ho/
[14:28] <jnix> it's faililng because i'm not using kerberos
[14:28] <jnix> is there a way to keep ubuntu's ssh client from checking that first? just immediately do password login vs trying to find an appropriate method
[14:28] <wlosio> bekks, so.... if that is problem of RAM... so how much RAM is needed for ~150mb .TIFF photos?
[14:29] <Tex_Nick> iceroot : try CTRL+SUPER+D
[14:29] <bekks> wlosio: Depends on the resolution of the pictures.

[14:50] <eutheria> seeing as deja-dup is totally useless and you can't restore your backup from one machine to another
[14:50] <DJones> Gaga: Your best bet of an answer to that is to join #ubuntu-phone and ask there
[14:50] <eutheria> what other backup systems should people use?
[14:51] <krz> how do i check which synaptics touchpad driver i have installed
[14:51] <aguitel> atlef, see that:http://paste.ubuntu.com/1516917/
[14:52] <Gaga> DJones: Thank you!
[14:53] <atlef> aguitel, have you tried to install it using Synaptic Package Manager
[14:54] <Gaga> #ubuntu-phone No such channel in list https://wiki.ubuntu.com/IRC/ChannelList
[14:54] <aguitel> atlef, yes
[14:54] <aguitel> atlef, same ussue
[14:54] <DJones> Gaga: It exists, I'm in it now

[14:59] <snax> hi everybody
[14:59] <eutheria> sigh, using deja-dup you might as well not backup
[14:59] <snax> i've got a little problem with mdadm
[14:59] <snax> i have two PCs, my desktop and my htpc
[15:00] <snax> in my desktop there are 5 HDDs with 2 partitions

[15:00] <nicholas__> Hello. Having some trouble on Ubuntu Server, where it at a random freezes(?) up, and drops the network connection through eth0. Cannot access any services, but can login through direct access to the machine. Anyone know what would cause this, and if there is any fix?
[15:00] <eutheria> nicholas__, have you tried diagnosing the problem?
[15:01] <nicholas__> eutheria, I wouldn't really know where to start. Looked through syslog, but nothing stood out. I'm at the machine right now, and I can neither send or recieve traffic on it
[15:02] <snax> ok. so there are a 2,99 TB partition for a raid 5 and a 1 gb partition for a raid 0 whick works as swap. both raids are encrypted with luks. now i want to put these drives into my htpc. de raid 0 was correct recognized but the raid 5 is inactive and every partition is recognized as spare
[15:02] <aguitel> atlef, ok
[15:02] <ben1u> Hello. during the period / operation increases the CPU load of Firefox more and more. Is known the problem?
[15:02] <eutheria> nicholas__, do you know what sort of network cards are in it? have you tried any hardware diagnostic tools?
[15:03] <ben1u> now 8h in operation.
[15:03] <eutheria> come on duplicity
[15:03] <eutheria> don't make me cry

[15:05] <nicholas__> eutheria, my motherboard is http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131781 and seems the network card is a Realtek 8111E
[15:05] <eutheria> nicholas__, you have the right ip config?
[15:07] <krz> anyone  know how to get the current version of the synaptics touchpad driver?
[15:08] <KaiForce> nicholas__: sounds like hardware conflict, or malfunctioning hardware
[15:09] <eutheria> KaiForce, or two machines have the same ip address
[15:09] <nicholas__> might be, I've set up static IP in /etc/network/interfaces (old config), while also assigning a static IP from my router (same IP), could that be the issue?
[15:09] <adamk> krz: Xorg driver versions can be found in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[15:09] <KaiForce> eutheria: doesn't Ubuntu advise if that situation occurs?
[15:10] <eutheria> KaiForce, he is using server
=== chiluk is now known as chiluk_away
[15:10] <KaiForce> eutheria: ah.  nicholas__ :  a "static" address in DHCP is not the same as a static address.  If the address is reserved in DHCP and you've set it statically on the machine, you shouldn't have an IP conflict
[15:11] <NeoColossus> Hello all!
[15:11] <krz> adamk, and how exacly should i access that?
[15:12] <nicholas__> KaiForce, ok. Would be wierd if that was the issue, since it's been working fine since I bought the machine (~6 months ago), it's just started to act up the last 3 days
=== _dmn_ is now known as _dmn
[15:12] <KaiForce> you could pull the cable and ping the address from another device.  If you get a response (or an arp match) you'll know that's the problem
[15:13] <ska> Does the ATI/AMD driver installer create a package for you to install, or does it install directly?
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[15:13] <adamk> It can do either.
[15:13] <ska> amd-driver-installer-catalyst-12.10-x86.x86_64.run is the file
[15:13] <nearst> yup. it work good
[15:13] <adamk> Though, frankly, if you don't know what you are doing, you should stick with the driver version Ubuntu packages.
[15:13] <NeoColossus> I have appended the line export PATH=$PATH:~/bin to my ~/.bashrc file to allow created scripts to be ran as a command rather than a script. Is there a way to make this recursive for all subdirectories in ~/bin without implementing several export lines?
[15:13] <ska> adamk: ok.. thanks...
[15:14] <KaiForce> NeoColossus: not that I know of, that would be interesting
[15:15] <ska> adamk: I see some proprietary drivers in the Package-Gui manager, but they seem to fail installation.
[15:15] <KaiForce> actually that could probably be scripted by someone skilled in bash
[15:15] <adamk> ska: You might want to find out why :-)  They *should* work, and they do here.
[15:15] <KaiForce> NeoColossus: may want to ask in #bash
[15:15] <NeoColossus> It's because I have one script that makes new directories that contain files, in it's parent directory. Rather than have all the files go to ~/bin when I run the command.
[15:16] <NeoColossus> KaiForce: Just because I mention script does not mean it is a bash question. It's simply making an action recursive.
[15:17] <NeoColossus> Granted I could write a script that performs that function but there should already be some sort of implementation for it.
[15:17] <KaiForce> NeoColossus: I'm simply telling you how I would approach the problem.  You are free to ignore my advice.
[15:17] <nicholas__> KaiForce, might have turned out to be some faulty config from my part. Tried restarting networking, nothing changed. Tried setting networking to use dhcp-client, restarted - worked agian. The thing that makes me uncomfortable is that this "suddenly" happened after months of working fine, so I'm suspicious that there might be another source to my problem.
[15:18] <NeoColossus> If all else fails in research, I shall digress and write a function for it myself.
[15:18] <FunkyELF> how can I upgrade to a new version of mpd?  The version with 12.04 is 0.16.5, doesn't work for me, and according to #mpd is unsupported
[15:18] <KaiForce> nicholas__: I would trust your instinct on that...
[15:19] <NeoColossus> KaiForce: I appreciate your approach but from personal experience, the fellas over at #bash jump on you pretty heavily when it is not a bash question.
[15:19] <jrib> NeoColossus: it is a bash question though...
[15:20] <thec4ke> well technically settings path isnt a bash question
[15:20] <nicholas__> Hehe yeah. I'll upgrade my packages to exclude outdated software. Server is still running 10.04, but that couldn't be a huge issue? Nothing else to do but to wait for it to "eventually" happen again. Thanks for you help KaiForce and eutheria!
[15:20] <NeoColossus> thec4ke: Thank you!
[15:21] <jrib> thec4ke: setting PATH for your bash shell is not a bash question?
[15:22] <thec4ke> path applies to any shell or any program you run under it
[15:22] <thec4ke> bash just happens to use it
[15:22] <jrib> thec4ke: yes...
[15:22] <Kelbizzle> Hello, I'm logged into my machine at home via ssh. Is there an easy way I can move a file from that machine to this machine here at work?
[15:22] <thec4ke> but yea its kinda pendantic tbh
[15:23] <sw> Kelbizzle sftp/scp etc ...
[15:23] <jhutchins_wk> Kelbizzle: scp or rsync
[15:23] <thec4ke> if I knew how to help him i wouldnt be like ITS NOT A BASH QUESTION GAWD
[15:23] <boichev> Kelbizzle, scp your_user_at_home@ip_at_home:/path/to/file .
[15:23] <NeoColossus> thec4ke: I agree there but as I have mentioned, it will likely become a loopty-loop on who to ask.
[15:23] <jrib> NeoColossus: anyway, the worst that can happen is you don't get help.  The best that can happen is you get an answer.
[15:23] <KaiForce> NeoColossus: did you google?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/657108/bash-recursively-adding-subdirectories-to-the-path
[15:23] <boichev> Kelbizzle, this will copy the file to the current dir if you want it somewhere else just substitute the . with /path/foo
[15:24] <Kelbizzle> jhutchins_wk: boichev  so there's no way to do it in the current session.
[15:24] <NeoColossus> jrib: Oh I understand, like I said there should be something implemented but if not it's not a problem for me to write the function myself.
[15:24] <NeoColossus> KaiForce: I did not...
[15:24] <Kelbizzle> boichev: okay I think I understand.\
[15:24] <KaiForce> you are right, the bash guys would have jumped on you
=== rla is now known as Guest98455
[15:25] <jrib> I still suggest you ask #bash
[15:25] <jhutchins_wk> Kelbizzle: ssh does not have a background file transfer option.
[15:26] <thec4ke> that stack overflow link will only add to path once
[15:26] <NeoColossus> jrib: duely noted
[15:26] <thec4ke> if you make a new directory youll have to run it again
[15:26] <Kelbizzle> jhutchins_wk: that makes sense. I can work around it. Thank you and boichev for your quick responses.
[15:26] <boichev> Kelbizzle, if you want a more frendly way to move files around open a file manager go to the field where your current location is typed and in gnome press Ctrl + L this will let you edit the location not by buttons but with text and then clear all and type ssh://user_at_home@ip_at_home:/
[15:26] <NeoColossus> thec4ke, in that case you just source ~/.bashrc
[15:27] <boichev> Kelbizzle, this will make you move files in the two ways from the gui :)
[15:27] <KaiForce> thec4ke: isn't that true of any solution?
[15:27] <thec4ke> thats correct
[15:27] <losier> hi everyone,i have something wrong with my kde environment
[15:27] <thec4ke> thought you wanted something automatic though :)
[15:27] <KaiForce> an automatic solution to that would be very interesting
[15:28] <NeoColossus> I agree. It may become a project of mine...
[15:29] <jrib> losier: what's that?
[15:29] <NeoColossus> Only issue I see is that you would need to set the static parent in the function so that all children can be dynamic
[15:30] <NeoColossus> i.e ~/bin
[15:30] <losier> the computer became very slow when i entered plasma,and when i ran top,i found 'akonadi-nepomuk','akonadi-maildis' occupied 100% of the cpu each.and i had to kill them by hand.what's wrong?

[15:39] <compdoc> is there a way to make the command "sudo nautilus" be able to browse the network?
[15:39] <hdd> jrib: soo there is no way to install /build/re-compile that package?
[15:39] <jrib> hdd: there is.  But you should upgrade your ubuntu version to a supported version first.
[15:40] <ExxKA> compdoc, it is not as much the command as it is a matter of having samba installled
[15:40] <compdoc> samba is always installed
[15:40] <hdd> jrib: i cant, becouse it a production server, and as a policy (my paranoid boss) its not allow to upgrade versions
[15:40] <jrib> hdd: in fact, if you upgrade to 12.04, then you'll have postgresql-server-dev-9.1 in the default repositories

[15:47] <jhutchins_wk> palasso: No.

[15:47] <orudie> Hi. I installed ubuntu 12.04 yesterday , and I am having trouble browsing windows domain shares. Please help
[15:47] <hdd> jrib: aaaa got it :D sorry
[15:48] <hdd> jrib: thanks ;)
[15:48] <hdd> sorry guys for my faces
[15:48] <palasso> Since full disk encryption isn't possible, is it possible to encrypt the / partition of Ubuntu during installation?
[15:48] <jrib> palasso: pretty sure full disk encryption just means the partitions related to ubuntu.  Though I admit I've never used it
[15:49] <palasso> then why wouldn't it work if it means only the partitions for ubuntu ?
[15:49] <BluesKaj> orudie, install ntfs-3g , and make sure the windows foldwes have share permissions in windows
[15:49] <palasso> it's a little awkward to say full disk encryption but mean the partitions of ubuntu
[15:50] <KamZou> Hi, i'd like to login to my ubuntu even if LDAP server is down, any way of configuration for PAM to do that ?
[15:51] <f2000> hey room, new to ubuntu, got a few questions if any of you guys (or girls) are feeling in a helpful mood today?
[15:51] <jrib> palasso: doesn't it say "Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security."?
[15:52] <palasso> Yes but I don't understand if that's different from full disk encryption
[15:52] <f2000> just got ubuntu server installed (no gui!) and I was trying to join our MS/AD domain
[15:53] <f2000> but dont think my NIC card has been installed
[15:53] <krz> fark. i just did sudo apt-get install rails.  how do i undo this?
[15:53] <boichev> f2000, can you try ifconfig -a
[15:53] <palasso> jrib if i want to dual boot ubuntu with windows can i use that option "Encrypt the new Ubuntu installation for security." or will it mess my windows installation?
[15:54] <boichev> f2000, can you see any ethX devices
[15:54] <jrib> palasso: my guess is that it would not touch your windows partition.  But I do not know for sure.
[15:54] <f2000> thanks man, just checking now
[15:54] <palasso> well I wouldn't want to know that it messes my windows partition by experimenting :D
[15:54] <f2000> em1 + lo
[15:54] <boichev> krz,  sudo apt-get uninstall rails
[15:55] <boichev> krz or if you don't need the config files sudo apt-get --purge remove rails
[15:55] <Pici> boichev, krz: its remove not uninstall
[15:55] <eutheria> ok so duplicity is not reliable
[15:55] <eutheria> what other options are there?
[15:55] <boichev> Pici, as i typed --purge think of that :D
[15:56] <krz> boichev, you sure its sudo apt-get uninstall rails?
[15:56] <hdd> jrib: for how long ubuntu-server-12.04 will have support??
[15:56] <jrib> hdd: 5 years from release
[15:56] <f2000> if i do run "ifconfig -a" i see em1 and lo
[15:56] <hdd> jrib: so something like 2017?
[15:57] <boichev> krz, sudo apt-get remove rails :)

[15:57] <boichev> f2000, em1 is your build in lan card is there an ip there ?
[15:58] <f2000> @ boichev : yup, onboard card
[15:58] <f2000> doesnt have ip on it
[15:58] <fantus> hello...if you are logged in as administrator, does that means that you have root premisession ?
[15:59] <boichev> f2000, I can't tell you how to get to your MS/AD domain but first get an ip :) if you have dhcp server use sudo dhclient em1
[15:59] <f2000> haha no worries :) at least thats a step in the right direction
[16:00] <f2000> got an ip now!
[16:00] <boichev> f2000, what version of ubuntu do you use ?
[16:00] <f2000> ubuntu-12.10-server-amd64
[16:00] <dufa> fantus: you would still need to use sudo in order to get root premissions
[16:01] <jhutchins_wk> Full disk encryption is like it says, the whole disk.  It does a secure wipe in the process.

[16:08] <fantus> when i type "su root" or "su" or "sudo root" and type password, i get message: Authentification failure. (ps: im logged as administrator)..what to type to get root access?
[16:08] <nearst> f2000, turnkey is good imo, ubuntu base
[16:08] <jrib> !sudo | fantus
[16:08] <ubottu> fantus: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo

[16:09] <fantus> compdoc, sudo su worked. thanks
[16:09] <compdoc> fantus, its rare you actually need to become root. best to use sudo command
[16:09] <raven_> hi
[16:09] <f2000> @ nearst: just did a serach there (not heard of it before). So is it just ubuntu server, but with the gui pre-installed?@
[16:09] <fantus> just wanted to know the command thats it, no need and interests in becoming the root ) got my answer tho, thanks
[16:10] <f2000> is it a good place to start for a ubuntu beginner?

[16:12] <jil> I am trying to check my hardisk for errors. I am using smartctl -t long ... do I have to restart?
[16:12] <compdoc> Third3ye, if you install using ubuntu-server, and possible the alt desktop installer, you get the option for lvm
[16:12] <jil> If not, I how do I know if the test if finished? I have waited the required time but nothing in my test log.  thx
[16:12] <jhutchins_wk> Third3ye: If you don't know, why not just go with the defaults and get to know the system first?

=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[16:18] <nicholas__> have a small issue with my raid5-setup with mdadm. i have specified "devices=/dev/sda1,/dev/sdb1,/dev/sde1" in my mdadm.conf, but still it tries to create the raid using /dev/sda, /dev/sdb and /dev/sde on boot. this turns out to break LVM and causes the boot to halt, waiting for the drive.
[16:18] <Third3ye> But hypothetically speaking, if i do install as lvm via the automated feature, afterwards i could just resize the partition, make a new one and copy the files from home over to the new partition
[16:19] <jhutchins_wk> jil: Have you been monitoring the drive with smart or are you just now starting to test it?
[16:19] <nearst> avoid lvm and raid :D
[16:19] <fantus> jrib ok thanks
[16:19] <Third3ye> i don't have raid :P But thanks
[16:19] <nicholas__> yeah nearst, seems like they tend to annoy eachother
[16:19] <f2000> nearst: i was hoping to setup a newznab server for personal use, would turnkey be a better solution (sorry for all the questions)
[16:20] <jil> I started a test 4 hours ago.  It said to wait for 70min which I did
[16:20] <jil> but I have nothing in the logs.
[16:20] <Third3ye> screw it, I'm doing it anyways
[16:21] <jil> How can I know if the smart test has really started?
[16:21] <nearst> f2000, worth to try. ima bet
[16:21] <jhutchins_wk> jil: You can use top and ps ax | grep smart
[16:21] <nicholas__> guessing I could add nobootwait to the mounts in fstab, and create a startup-script that assembles the raid correctly and sets status active to the volume group, but that feels like such a hack
[16:21] <nearst> nicholas__, and im not trust grub2 and ext4. lol
[16:21] <jhutchins_wk> jil: Do you see disk activity?  Why are you testing the drive?
[16:22] <f2000> cool, i have it downloading now. i just wondered why it would be better to use this that the offical build?
[16:23] <Third3ye> is it true that kubuntu is going to be discontinued?
[16:23] <jhutchins_wk> f2000: Well, if you install the official build, you can get help here.  If you install a third party build, answers you get here may or may not be correct.
[16:23] <nearst> f2000, u boot and all stuff already for use. only some config
[16:23] <jil> I have some disk activity, but I don't see smartctl when I grep ps... at the same time issuing a new test tell me that it's in progress at 80% since 4 hours?

[16:24] <f2000> ahhh ok, i get you know (gui's etc will be allready installed)
[16:24] <jhutchins_wk> jil: smart does not check for bad blocks.
[16:24] <jhutchins_wk> jil: fsck does that.
[16:24] <jil> ok, but smart will give me some usefull stuff on my disk right?
[16:25] <jil> I like if I have hardware falts
[16:26] <jhutchins_wk> jil: It can.  The most common use is to enable long-term monitoring so that if you start to have problems you'll see them in the logs.

[16:29] <hsnmck> any idea please?

[16:29] <hsnmck> Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs)
[16:29] <nearst> magiK_, try nomodeset at grub boot
[16:29] <alfonsoo> hola
[16:30] <nearst> entr0py, i would always read man tbh
[16:30] <magiK_> nearst, in the grub console type nomodeset no other parameters?
[16:30] <jhutchins_wk> hsnmck: cat /proc/filesystems - do you see smbfs/cifs?
[16:30] <nearst> usually im use "nomodeset verbose"
[16:31] <hsnmck> jhutchins_wk, no
[16:31] <Num83rGuy> Why does network manager never auto connect my VPN connection though I have "connect automatically" checked in the settings?
[16:31] <magiK_> nearst, what exactly does that do?
[16:32] <nearst> !nomodeset | magiK_
[16:32] <ubottu> magiK_: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[16:32] <jhutchins_wk> hsnmck: Are smbfs or cifs-utils installed?
[16:32] <hsnmck> jhutchins_wk, smbfs is installed yes
[16:33] <magiK_> nearst, well everything looks fine, I was just wondering if since it's undetectable that there would be a way to detect it
[16:33] <hsnmck> jhutchins_wk, smbfs is installed yes
[16:33] <nyuszika7h> hi, fglrx's recent versions dropped support for my card. is there any way to get the legacy fglrx?

[16:33] <zhaozhou> hsnmck, and modules are loaded?
[16:33] <hsnmck> zhaozhou, I don't know how can I load them? I only installed smbfs using apt-get
[16:34] <zhaozhou> hsnmck, should be 'sudo modprobe cifs'
[16:34] <magiK_> It seems to be working correctly, but show's up as unknown when I look at the About System.
[16:34] <nearst> magiK_, usually nomodeset as a temp solution for splash graphic problem imo
[16:34] <hsnmck> zhaozhou, I got FATAL: Module cifs not found.
[16:35] <nearst> magiK_, ya. same to me. since xorg load fine. so no probs
[16:35] <magiK_> nearst, k I was just wondering if I was missing something and missing out on the full potential of the card.
[16:36] <nearst> meaning?
[16:36] <zhaozhou> hsnmck, sudo insmod /lib/modules/`uname -r`/kernel/fs/cifs/cifs.ko perhaps

[16:37] <hsnmck> zhaozhou, nope :( No such file or directory
[16:37] <zhaozhou> hsnmck, Have you recently updated your kernel?
[16:37] <jhutchins_wk> hsnmck: The cifs module is part of the kernel - what kernel are you running (uname -r)?
[16:38] <craigbass1976> I've got an fstab that mounts a samba share, but the samba share is on the box itself.  Samba isn't fired up yet when fstab is processed.

[16:39] <zhaozhou> craigbass1976, Check around in /var/log for interesting stuff. Just `tail` away. Careful of the 'wtmp'-file though.
[16:40] <newbie13> and the scroll wheel just doesnt work at all
[16:40] <toxboi> craigbass1976: You can check the Samba server logs.
[16:40] <newbie13> already tried different workarounds
[16:40] <toxboi> You may even like to check /var/log/messages and look for any cifs errors.
[16:40] <newbie13> installed the virtualbox additions

[16:41] <newbie13> already tried writing to the xserverconfig file, but its empty
[16:41] <zhaozhou> hsnmck, huh. It is wierd that you haven't got cifs as part of your standard kernel package.
[16:42] <jhutchins_wk> zhaozhou: Not entirely standard kernel.
[16:42] <hsnmck> zhaozhou, is there a way to work it around ? install it in some easy way?
[16:42] <nearst> newbie13, sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh ?
[16:42] <zhaozhou> Jhlorn, Should be standard for this particular platform though?
[16:42] <jhutchins_wk> hsnmck: Do an aptitude search cifs
[16:42] <jhutchins_wk> hsnmck: also smbfs
[16:42] <r4y> Videos don't work in Firefox 18 for me using Ubuntu 10.04, and I think it's because I need to downgrade to a lower version of Firefox, like 3.6, but I am not sure how and if that is correct
[16:42] <newbie13> havent tried this what does this command  do?
[16:43] <jhutchins_wk> hsnmck: See if somebody built it as an external module for that system.
[16:43] <zhaozhou> hsnmck, The only solution I can think of is compiling it yourself, which is, you know, a pain. Someone else might help you.

[16:49] <xangua> r4y: i can change my background, font, icon and gtk theme in unity

For some reason I get fairly frequent 5 second periods where I can move the mouse and it reacts instantly, but any clicks or keystrokes will do nothing, but they will buffer up and happen all at once after the delay
[17:05] <melkor> ShinyObjects: are you using unity?
[17:05] <ShinyObjects> I heavily doubt it's something swapping - 8 gigs of ram and all. I'm running some decently cpu intensive apps but the delays don't always correspond to activity and "top" shows very little cpu usage

=== slank is now known as slank_away
[17:07] <ShinyObjects> The rest of the url looks solid, but the version number may be off.
[17:07] <ShinyObjects> So, for instance, if they just updated the repo's package from 2.7.8.dfsg-5.1ubuntu4.2 to 2.7.9.dfsg-5.1ubuntu4.2
[17:08] <ShinyObjects> (note the 8 and 9 differ)
[17:08] <ShinyObjects> Then it could explain that.
[17:08] <ShinyObjects> The server couldn't be down because it gets a 404 response
[17:08] <ShinyObjects> If the server was down the request would just time out
[17:09] <melkor> ShinyObjects: true.
[17:09] <melkor> ShinyObjects: You suggestion is solid.
[17:09] <ShinyObjects> (unless they put up a temporary server to just issue 404s, like an "oops" page)
[17:09] <melkor> ShinyObjects: For your issue I would suggest bailing on the effects for a bit, and try without composting to see if it fixes the problem.
[17:10] <ShinyObjects> melkor - boy do I hope that isn't the problem. I've gotten way too used to the ability to zip around with expose, scale, etc.
[17:10] <jhutchins_wk> ShinyObjects: You might also want to look at I/O wiht the systats package.
[17:10] <ShinyObjects> melkor: I'll give it a try to triage though
[17:10] <melkor> ShinyObjects: It sounds like an x type problem, maybe related to your graphics card/driver.
[17:11] <melkor> ShinyObjects: I don't think you would have to do without effects, it just might narrow the problem down.
=== Gulug is now known as ice
[17:11] <ShinyObjects> jhutchins_wk: ok. I used iotop, but nothing appeared to be hogging I/O. I sort of discounted the I/O idea though because all the apps are running without a hitch, just not responding to input
[17:12] <ShinyObjects> Yep. Good call melkor.
[17:12] <rk0n> I broke my graphics - I was trying to install my nvidia drivers and now I'm stuck at a tiny resoloution.. how can I get back to the default drivers?

[17:16] <raven_> sftp on ubuntu 12.10: i need sftp accounts for 4 users with access on the same folder and without any access to command line - what would be the best approach to config this?
[17:17] <jhutchins_wk> raven_: Just using standard ssh?
[17:17] <raven_> jhutchins_wk, i do not know what would be best
[17:18] <raven_> jhutchins_wk, there was something like scponly but ssh shall be similar
[17:18] <chrisr> What's the best way to change the uid and guid of the main user on my ubuntu system?
[17:18] <chrisr> (..of the only normal user)
[17:19] <jhutchins_wk> chrisr: Why?
[17:19] <jhutchins_wk> raven_: scponly's the right way, and make the home directory the target.
[17:19] <chrisr> jhutchins_wk: I need the same uid/guid as all my files on the network
=== mspencer is now known as iBelieve
[17:20] <jhutchins_wk> chrisr: One solution is centralized login with NIS or Winbind.
[17:20] <raven_> jhutchins_wk, scponly is not longer supported because i read openssh does everything it did
[17:20] <chrisr> jhutchins_wk: I'm not in a position to change the company policy
=== nearst is now known as Guest88831
[17:21] <chrisr> jhutchins_wk: we use autofs to mount all our network folders and home folder
[17:21] <Joel> apt-get update did the trick, had to get it into a different spot of my chef recipe
[17:21] <jhutchins_wk> chrisr: You can create a user with a specific UID/GID.

[17:25] <SuperDefenderX> Anyone know how to get Gwibber to work correctly in Ubuntu 12.10? It's blank and showing nothing.
[17:25] <CamilloCienfuego> But if I want to set up a desktop backgroundpicture i can see the pictures in my folders but they have all 0 bytes

[17:30] <dcherniv> CamilloCienfuego, run df -i see what it says
[17:30] <dcherniv> CamilloCienfuego, inode is basically an entry about a file in a table, the amount of files on the filesystem is limited by the size of the inode table
[17:31] <CamilloCienfuego> ok so what command should I run exactly?

[17:43] <disharmonic> evening
[17:44] <CamilloCienfuego> how can I copy something out of the terminal?
[17:44] <raven_> ejv vsftpd seems to be an option tnx for the hint :)
[17:45] <dcherniv> CamilloCienfuego, select with mouse, to paste middle click mouse
[17:45] <jrib> CamilloCienfuego: one way: highlight it with your mouse, then use your mouse's middle click to paste
[17:46] <CamilloCienfuego> aint got no middle button or wheel only two cause its an laptop is the something like strg+c?
[17:47] <jrib> CamilloCienfuego: you can click both buttons at the same time then.  Or use shift-insert
[17:47] <raven_> ejv but is vsftpd able to set a custom folder to work in?
[17:47] <disharmonic> eclipse in the repos includes CDT?
[17:47] <ejv> raven_: vsftpd does support chroot jailing, read the documentation
[17:48] <raven_> ejv ok but i need to set the folder on myself
[17:48] <ejv> raven_: naturally
[17:48] <raven_> ?
[17:48] <usr13> raven_: https://security.appspot.com/vsftpd/vsftpd_conf.html

[17:57] <nicholas__> Using LVM over 2x Raid-5. My LV is marked as N/A on boot, and upon "vgchange -ay" I recieve: "Refusing activation of partial LV lvm0. Use --partial to override." which, I assume is the reason it isn't active on boot. Any idea on how to fix this? With --partial the LV activated and running fine, but the refusal to create it on boot worries me.
[17:57] <EndUserXY> Well here it goes then the check's in the mail btw :-P
[17:57] <Tex_Nick> EndUserXY : ask your question :)
[17:58] <orudie> what is a keyboard shortcut to switch between work spaces ?
[17:58] <EndUserXY> I am dual booting windows and lubuntu, I have VBox on both partitions. I install them in windows and share them with linux
[17:58] <usr13> orudie: Ctrl-Alt right or left arrow
[17:59] <EndUserXY> So I set my fstab to automount my windows partition and changed owner and group to my username
[17:59] <Tex_Nick> orudie : try CTRL+ALT+Rifgt
[17:59] <Tex_Nick> Right*
[18:00] <EndUserXY> what I need to know is if setting umask 022 will be sufficient and sane permissions to share my VMs from the windows partition with VBox on my linux partition
[18:00] <usr13> orudie: Ctrl F1,F2,F3 etc. may also work.

[18:01] <CamilloCienfuego> all right I've pastebinned it . Cheers for your pacience guys

[18:07] <EndUserXY> so what were you saying before netsplit about umask 022
[18:07] <usr13> t4nk002: Or:  sudo vim /etc/rc.local
[18:07] <bekks> EndUserXY: The umask is pretty irrelevant at that point. Which filesystem do you have on your shared partition?
[18:07] <usr13> bekks: His answer was ntfs
[18:08] <EndUserXY> oh ntfs is the partition I am mounting in lubuntu to access my vbox vm I installed in windows
[18:08] <usr13> EndUserXY: bekks has already given you the answer
[18:08] <bekks> EndUserXY: On NTFS, the umask is irrelevant at all, because POSIX permissions cannot be stored on NTFS.
[18:09] <EndUserXY> really I guess I misunderstood what I read earlier, I thought umask was in place of UNIX permissions on NTFS
[18:09] <t4nk002> usr13: now if I restart ubuntu that will always run the command?

[18:15] <EndUserXY> josh not as far as I know

[18:16] <josh_> EndUserXY: any suggestions on installing it, then?  the only source of installation docs seems to be that web page, which is gone
[18:16] <josh_> usr13: yes, but there are post-install steps, which are ONLY documented on that web site
[18:17] <usr13> josh_: On what website?
[18:17] <EndUserXY> should be able to just sudo apt-get install synaptic
[18:17] <usr13> josh_: I do not know of any post-install proceedures.
[18:17] <cha0s_> i am looking for some help with ffmpeg on 12.04 if anyone has a minute
[18:18] <josh_> usr13: well, I installed it.  All that appears in my links is a link to that web page.
[18:18] <asmod4n> hi, compiled samba 4.0 final on 12.10 and set it up as a domain controller with roaming profile support, oplocking is broken.
[18:18] <usr13> cha0s_: Sure...
[18:18] <josh_> usr13: there's no program, no configuration dialogn, nothing
[18:18] <EndUserXY> josh_ did you read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
[18:18] <josh_> so clearly something else is required
[18:18] <josh_> EndUserXY: no, because that wasn't linked anywhere
[18:18] <asmod4n> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1517596/
[18:18] <EndUserXY> say what josh_
[18:18] <josh_> OH!
[18:19] <cha0s_> usr13 i am trying to convert video files to mjpeg for use with an innotab 2. my system is telling me that ffmpeg  is depricated and to use avconv
[18:19] <josh_> No Synaptic, the package manager
[18:19] <josh_> Synaptiks, the touchpad manager
[18:19] <EndUserXY> ohhh
[18:19] <asmod4n> its working fine on another distribution just not on the one i prefer :/
[18:19] <cha0s_> usr i'm trying to use with winff and i'm a bit lost to say the least

[18:20] <usr13> cha0s_: Really?  I didn't know that Ubuntu was dropping ffmpeg.  That's interesting.
[18:20] <asmod4n> ffmpeg got renamed
[18:20] <EndUserXY> josh_ it's synaptics
[18:20] <usr13> asmod4n: Oh, thank you.
[18:20] <EndUserXY> not synaptiks and synaptics touch pad mngr should be in the repos
[18:21] <josh_> no, the package is most definitely spelled "synaptiks"
[18:21] <josh_> see the web page
[18:21] <cha0s_> ** THIS PROGRAM IS DEPRECATED ***
[18:21] <cha0s_> This program is only provided for compatibility and will be removed in a future release. Please use avconv instead.
[18:21] <usr13> josh_: I did not see that spelling difference.
[18:22] <usr13> josh_: I assumed it was just a spelling error.
[18:22] <josh_> usr13: yeah, I just realized the confusion when EndUser linked me to a web page
[18:22] <asmod4n> so how to get in touch with a ubuntu kernel developer? got the same samba oplocking problem as 6 years ago...
[18:23] <cha0s_> usr13: anyway i tried already downloading the avconv from software center, and changing the path to executables in winfff to accomodate however still no output
[18:23] <josh_> anyway, I'll take it as given that the project is abandoned and I shouldn't use it.  is there another advanced touchpad settings package for ubuntu?  or do I just have to wait for Kernel 3.7?
[18:23] <usr13> josh_:  kde-config-touchpad: touchpad configuration tool (synaptiks) ?
[18:23] <tripelb> Does 12.04 fit on a CD or does it have to be on a DVD?

[18:23] <usr13> josh_: Sorry, I was totally lost
[18:23] <asmod4n> tripelb: the net installer should fit on a floppy disk
[18:24] <asmod4n> ok. doesn't, its 30 MB ^^
[18:24] <cha0s_> usr13: any ideas?
[18:24] <josh_> EndUserXY: you're saying that's what I should use?  Or something else?
[18:25] <CamilloCienfuego> got an lubuntu problem are you able to help?
[18:25] <usr13> cha0s_: Sorry, I don't know anything about avconv.  I would suppose it works just like ffmpeg though, (since it was just said that it was a name change), so....
[18:25] <tripelb> asmod4n: now I am confused even more. Oh install from net. No my net is dialup speed though my cellphone
[18:25] <EndUserXY> that may be the name of the package or at least a dependency is what I am saying with that link
[18:25] <tinner> hello
[18:26] <tinner> how can i install ubuntu on a usb to use as a live OS?
[18:26] <asmod4n> tripelb: i would buy it on a dvd then from canonical
[18:26] <josh_> EndUserXY: no, what I'm looking for is more advanced configurability than the built-in X.org package gives me.  The "synaptiks" package from the KDE project is listed in the Ubuntu Software Center as providing that, but the package appears to be abandoned.
[18:26] <asmod4n> tripelb: http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=1027
[18:27] <dufa> tinner: what are you currently running
[18:27] <usr13> tinner: Same as the install iso
[18:27] <josh_> usr13: not surprising.  "Synaptic" is a package-manager, "Synaptics" is both a touchpad brand and the built-in X.org driver, and "Synaptiks" is the KDE project
[18:27] <josh_> I'll try on KDE
[18:27] <tripelb> asmod4n: I read on some page that it is not a lived any more but has to be a DVD. I just tried the ppc-mac CD download. Its not normal. Different first screen. And.. Totally different file structure. I think I got something wrong g.
[18:27] <tinner> i am on Windows 8 eight now
[18:28] <usr13> josh_: Well, yea, I suppose you would only need it if you're running KDE
[18:28] <EndUserXY> oh I understand now, sorry josh_ , I thougt you needed the driver itself not a config gui
[18:28] <tinner> if ia m not wrong, the ubuntu website had a link to a program that would install ubuntu on a usb
[18:28] <tinner> but that page seems to be missing
[18:28] <tripelb> asmod4n: I am in a nexus7 right now, wanting to put Ubuntu on a g4 iMac with 384M RAM
[18:29] <EndUserXY> but yes, the driver package is xserver-xorg-input-synaptics
[18:29] <CamilloCienfuego>      0     down vote          favorite                                                 can't see all my data . I mean all my pictures ect. aren't in  my datamanager.I simply can't see them. But if I want to set up a  desktop backgroundpicture i can see the pictures in my folders but they  have all 0 bytes. if I copy something into my folders theyre just gone .  can't access them after that. just like the pencil in batman.
[18:29] <josh_> usr13: well, actually, that package used to provide enhanced configurability even if you were using gnome
[18:29] <dufa> tinner: you probably want to use untbootin
[18:29] <josh_> tinner: unetbootin
[18:29] <tinner> tyvm
[18:29] <josh_> tinner: still available
[18:29] <usr13> tinner: Why do you not just install Ubuntu normally?
[18:29] <EndUserXY> there is gsynaptics josh_ but I bet you don't want that
[18:29] <EndUserXY> lol
[18:30] <tinner> because I am not i would want it as my primary os
[18:30] <tinner> sure*
[18:30] <tripelb> asmod4n: I do not want to buy a DVD from canonical, thank you very much. I want to solve this problem as I have described it.
[18:30] <usr13> tinner: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/try-ubuntu-before-you-install
[18:31] <bekks> tripelb: Why dont you just download it, and burn it onto a DVD yourself?
[18:31] <josh_> EndUserXY: well no, but I do want to install its successor project!  Thanks, that's what I was looking for.
[18:31] <asmod4n> the ppc installer is only available as lubuntu and it is currently not working on my ibook g4.

[18:31] <kunji> Well, I tend to use usb always these days, half my machines don't even have cd drives
[18:31] <tinner> ah dufa thats the one i was taking about thanks
[18:32] <tinner> just wondering if that software shows it's own ulgy bootloader?
[18:32] <EndUserXY> josh_ and yes, I also get a 404 on synaptiks on bitbucket

[18:32] <EndUserXY> gysynaptics will run on KDE btw
[18:33] <josh_> EndUserXY: the post-Gsynaptics "Pointer COntroller" seems to be exactly what I want
[18:33] <usr13> tinner: Installing on a USB device is the same proceedure as installing on an internal drive, it is just that you pick the removable drive of your choice as target
[18:33] <josh_> actually
[18:33] <EndUserXY> josh_ yeah that seems to be what kubuntu users are using :-)
[18:33] <josh_> anyone know if there's a way I can file a bug to have synaptiks removed from apt-get?
[18:33] <tripelb> Tinner hi, yes there is a webpage for that
[18:33] <EndUserXY> launchpad maybe josh_
[18:33] <kunji> tripelb: Oh, a g4, I'm pretty sure they'll boot from usb.  I had some trouble with an old mac because the batter had died and so the internal clock was way off, and to fix that in the EFI stuff before it would install.
[18:34] <kunji> But I think that's g3?
[18:34] <asmod4n> powerpcs use openfirmware
[18:34] <kunji> Yeah
[18:34] <tripelb> Tinner for the future best to say your whole situation all on one line. I assume you have googled it so I will try to find it. Just a sec.
[18:34] <asmod4n> and as long as you have a usb port you can boot from it
[18:34] <kunji> It was a powerpc I was dealing with
[18:35] <tinner> but i remember trying mint earlier and the program I used(don't remember the name) showed its own bootloader. I don't need that. I just need the usb to boot ubuntu directly
[18:35] <EndUserXY> well guys I'm off to see the www.yzzzerdd :-)

[18:38] <MonkeyDust> ClientAlive  check ZAreason
[18:38] <kunji> asmod4: Well, you need to get the ppc version of ubuntu, and I had to use the alternate installer, but it did work via usb
[18:38] <ClientAlive> I'll google it. thx
[18:38] <tripelb> Everything you say without my user name I can assume is for someone else. EVERYBODY should be doing this except for first questions.
[18:38] <tinner> tripelb i do know that but i'm talking to everyone and just trying to ignore you

[18:39] <asmod4n> kunji: i just have no clue how to get raw write access to a usb stick on windows @tinner
[18:40] <ClientAlive> MonkeyDust: Oh, that's cool. Two that I've considered so far are the Asus Zenbook or the Thinkpad Edge. Don't want to get something that's known to have problems with linux tho.
[18:40] <jhutchins_wk> ClientAlive: Yes, linux has touchscreen support; basically a touch screen is the same as a mouse.  Multi-touch and specific hardware are less certain.
[18:40] <ejv> raw? adjectives/terminology is becoming strange in here.
[18:40] <kunji> asmod4n: Oh... on windows, you know, I've seen some tutorials in passing, but I never really paid much attention because I had a linux machine available...
=== ericab_away is now known as ericab
[18:41] <ClientAlive> jhutchins_wk: ok. I didn't know there was a distinction. I'm not sure it says which one of those the zenbook has.
[18:42] <tripelb> kunji: I am not trying to boot from USB on a Mac. I have NE er e er had success from that. I want to boot from disk. I made am disk. I want to know about the unusual file structure of the CD. If you have some experience we can talk. Another questioner here was wanting to boot from USB on windows and I found him|her the instruction page)
[18:42] <kunji> jhutchins_wk: Well, linux has such support (... linux is under Android for instance), but I don't think it's really come to desktop linux yet, except for the as a mouse support.
[18:42] <jhutchins_wk> ClientAlive: A lot of the touch-screen point-of-sale terminals in stores run linux, particularly IBM.
[18:42] <ClientAlive> jhutchins_wk: that makes sense
[18:43] <asmod4n> tripelb: just write the iso image to the cd, put it in the mac and press C when you boot.
[18:43] <tripelb> Tinner I don't care if you ignore me. I wanted you to know that I won't read it without my name in it.
[18:43] <josh_> ClientAlive: I'm using a Zenbook Prime right now
[18:44] <tripelb> asmod4n: I don't want to use a USB and I know they won't work on Mac. I was answering tinners question
[18:44] <kunji> tripelb: Hmm, well, I've successfully used both cd and usb boots on ppc mac in the past, but that was back on version 9.10 or something.  I haven't considered the file structure of the image much, what do you find to be unusual about it?
[18:44] <gyre008> does anyone know where is sar (sysstat) reading the Network stats from ?
[18:44] <ClientAlive> josh_: that's the baaad boy I was just drooling over  :>
[18:44] <josh_> it's very nice
[18:44] <gyre008> or how is it counting them /?
[18:44] <MonkeyDust> ClientAlive  or system76
[18:44] <josh_> basically, I have a linux-based Macbook Air now ;-)
[18:44] <josh_> ClientAlive: do you want the drawbacks?
[18:45] <ClientAlive> josh_: yours is the touchscreen one? Are you running linux AND using the touchscreen with it?
[18:45] <ClientAlive> josh_: yes please - very much I do
[18:45] <josh_> no, it's not touchscreen
[18:46] <tripelb> kunji: we need to talk. This Mac has a dead internal clock too. What is it that I need to do for it?
[18:46] <josh_> ClientAlive: so, first off, the laptop is beautiful and light and powerful and I love it
[18:46] <asmod4n> go to a app store and let them fix it
[18:46] <josh_> here's the handful of things which don't work under linux

[18:48] <tripelb> kunji: what does it mean to "fix that in the EFI stuff"
[18:48] <ejv> gyre008: /proc
[18:48] <josh_> (1) I can't set the mouse to left-handed and still use the touchpad without rebooting X
[18:48] <MonkeyDust> tripelb  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI#Case_when_Ubuntu_must_be_installed_in_EFI_mode
[18:49] <gyre008> ejv: thats what I was thinking...I'm quite interested how do they count the rate stats...
[18:49] <tripelb> asmod4n: yes I did that but I used the desktop image for the powerpc Mac image and not the alternate image since I have 384 M of ram
[18:49] <ultraparadigm> I need help with /etc/hosts file.  I have a laptop with two IP addresses.  One for eth0 and one for wifi.  I want it to have the same name regardless of how it connects.  How can I do that?
[18:49] <josh_> (2) if you restart with an external monitor plugged in, then the laptop screen goes blank (apparently this is an X.org problem affecting many laptops)
[18:50] <josh_> (3) like the Mac, the Zenbook has dongles.  Also like the Mac, some of them (like the miniVGA) are ONLY available from ASUS
[18:50] <tripelb> kunji: give me a couple of minutes to boot the Mac and I will tell/show you. Thanks.
[18:50] <kunji> tripelb: I'm trying to find it, I don't remember exactly what I did, but I needed to boot into the EFI and run some commands first to set the clock so that the install wouldn't crash, that might no longer be needed though, because crashing when the clock isn't set right was technically a bug, it may have been fixed since then
=== Catbuntu is now known as Nancys
[18:50] <josh_> I haven't figured out how to get Ubuntu to "zoom by default" on the laptop's high-rez screen yet
[18:50] <ejv> gyre008: look at the source code. you should be comfortable in the C programming languag and kernel data structures.
[18:51] <gyre008> :)
[18:51] <josh_> (5) the touchpad is overly sensitive and hard to control (hence my messing with gpointer)
[18:51] <gyre008> sure
[18:51] <kunji> tripelb: this approach looks interesting though, to do a netboot install : http://agentoss.wordpress.com/2011/12/23/ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin-on-imac-g3-powerpc/
[18:51] <josh_> ClientAlive: also, there's an Unbuntu wiki page about post-install tweaks for the Zenbook.  You will need to do those.
[18:52] <ejv> gyre008: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/s/sysstat/sysstat_10.0.3.orig.tar.bz2
[18:52] <gyre008> ejv: they must be getting it from /proc/net/dev
[18:52] <gyre008> ill have a look
[18:52] <tripelb> MonkeyDust: saw that
[18:53] <josh_> ClientAlive: otherwise, it's perfect.  I recommend it, and prefer it to the Mac
[18:53] <josh_> ClientAlive: also, it's silent and doesn't warm up unless you're somewhere hot
[18:54] <josh_> sound and video work great
[18:54] <ClientAlive> josh_: well I'm right handed so that first thing wouldn't effect me. But what is a dongle?
[18:54] <ejv> it's most likely beyond most users' comprehension. best of luck.
[18:54] <nathanr> does anyone know what makes Unity combine windows together in one icon on the Launcher?
[18:54] <ClientAlive> josh_: the transformer looks interesting too  :)
[18:54] <josh_> ClientAlive: the laptop doesn't have a vga or hdmi jack
[18:54] <jhutchins_wk> tripelb: THere's a coin cell battery on the motherboard that needs to be replaced.
[18:54] <josh_> it has mini-vga and mini-hdmi
[18:55] <josh_> which means you need adapters (dongles) to attach external monitors
[18:55] <josh_> same for ethernet
[18:55] <Guest23246> I have a LG GCC H20L - allegedly blu ray burner. I have been having problems with it.  I have my sights on a LG WH14NS40  that seems a great blu ray burner.  Can anyone tell me if it works under Ubuntu 12.10?

[18:56] <nrosvall_> animations are not like super slow, but just somewhat annoying. everything is usable, but I feel they should be smoother
[18:56] <josh_> and the miniVGA is *really* irritating, because it's ASUS-proprietary, so you can only buy it from ASUS

[19:10] <venegas> I have google page when I type in the url
[19:11] <MonkeyDust> venegas  that may be come out of the cache... can you search something with google?
[19:11] <venegas> I'll do it one second
[19:11] <rtc> previously, gdm allowed me to chose en_US from the menu, now neigher lightdm nor gdm have this option to the set locale charset on a per-user basis
[19:12] <ubuntunoob> Not sure i know there is different options in vb regarding the network adapter. In my tut it sais i should set both to internal network. Other options would be bridge and nat and several others

[19:13] <escott> ubuntunoob, its not clear what your setup is. what OS is the host, which is the guest? what is the output of "ifconfig" in both host and guest
[19:13] <jrib> rtc: yes, you ask a good question.  I don't know how (if there even is a way) to change the language locally for a user using the gui.  You should be able to edit ~/.pam_environment though.

[19:15] <ubuntunoob> Host is win7. Guests are ubunru12.04 and dsl

[19:27] <leku> there is no update-grubmanager
[19:27] <nearst> sudo update-grub

[19:28] <polix> leku: cmd=bash
[19:28] <leku> i understand dude
[19:28] <riqdiiz> it appears that it doesn't have the usb among boot options

[19:28] <nearst> shell too
[19:29] <ixio2b> anyone suggest a way to measure HDD performance? I have tried hdparm -Tt /dev/sda but Im getting unrealistic results
[19:29] <leku> i'll follow this page
[19:29] <polix> leku: good luck! ;)
[19:29] <leku> thanks
[19:29] <RollinV2_> ixio2b: whats unrealistic about the results?
[19:29] <polix> are here some Ukrainian ubuntu users?
[19:29] <Mantas7776> hi
[19:29] <leku> its kind of weird
[19:29] <Mantas7776> can anyone help me install ubuntu?
[19:29] <ixio2b> RollinV2_ 3.3GB/s
[19:30] <polix> hi Mantas7776
[19:30] <leku> i don't even see the linux partition here
[19:30] <leku> when I run gparted
[19:30] <polix> Mantas7776, what kind of help do you need?
[19:30] <leku> looks like linux wasnt even installed
[19:30] <Mantas7776> i installed ubuntu but net bootloader menu not appears
[19:30] <riqdiiz> disharmonic: it appears that it doesn't have the usb among boot options
[19:30] <ixio2b> leku are you using LVM?
[19:30] <RollinV2_> ixio2b: wow, ya that is a bad read
[19:30] <leku> i didn't tell it to use LVM
[19:30] <ixio2b> RollinV2_ I think its just reading from the RAID controller cache
[19:30] <leku> i have sda1-sda2,sda4, they're all ntfs
[19:30] <Mantas7776> i installed ubuntu but net bootloader menu not appears
[19:30] <GandalfB> I have a Samba share up,  sharing out var/www with the user and group permissions of rwx, with both user and group set to www.  I've then added the www group to my main login.   Now when I connect to that share from windows7, and create a file, it successfully  gets the correct group www as I set the  setgid Bit with chmod recursively across the www directory structure,  but the file only has read rights for the group
[19:30] <GandalfB> .   From reading i need to use ACL to set the default mask.   I've installed Eiciel, and I can see from that I can set the default ACL for a folder inside www but not WWW itself, the folder inside.  So - I figured that I needed to enable ACL on www folder, from tutorials It seemed like I needed to edit the Fstab configuration, which  from reading is stored in /etc/fstab,  I don't have that folder, I just have /etc/fst
[19:30] <GandalfB> ab.d and it's empty.  So I've now become a little but unstuck.  Sorry for long question, just wanted to capture as much as possible.

[19:32] <Mantas7776> nearst, if i install Ubuntu, which should i use as bootloader partition? same as ubuntu partition?
[19:32] <usr13> GandalfB: It's a file, not a directory.
[19:32] <Mantas7776> or i need to make other partition
[19:33] <GandalfB> usr13: How do you mean?
[19:33] <usr13> GandalfB: /etc/fstab is a file
[19:33] <Mantas7776> Can anyone tell me which partition i should set to install bootloader? same as ubuntu partition where i install?
[19:33] <GandalfB> usr13 oh....  let me go back and look again
[19:33] <leku>  /dev/sda1 or somethign?
[19:34] <Mantas7776> dev/sda1 for me is windows 7
[19:34] <Mantas7776> loader
[19:34] <Mantas7776> so should i install it here?
[19:34] <leku> i dont know isn't the MBR on the first partition?
[19:34] <escott> Mantas7776, the bootloader is installed to /dev/sda
[19:34] <Mantas7776> im not sure
[19:34] <usr13> GandalfB: I'm not sure that is where your problem is though.  In fact, I'm pretty sure that editing /etc/fstab is not the solution.  Go back and read the documentation again and see.
[19:34] <escott> leku, no it is not
[19:34] <leku> shrug
[19:34] <Mantas7776> well the problem is that
[19:34] <Mantas7776> i have sdd and hdd
[19:34] <leku> sorry dont use linux that much anymore
[19:34] <Mantas7776> so where i should install
[19:34] <Slart> Mantas7776: I usually set the computer to boot from another drive and keep the windows drive intact
[19:34] <ixio2b> anyone suggest a way to measure HDD performance? I have tried hdparm -Tt /dev/sda but Im getting unrealistic results, I want unbuffered/cached results
[19:34] <Mantas7776> i boot windows from ssd
[19:35] <Mantas7776> but i install linux to hdd
[19:35] <FloodBot1> Mantas7776: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[19:35] <escott> Mantas7776, please stop with the [ENTER]
[19:35] <Mantas7776> okok
[19:35] <Slart> Mantas7776: Windows need the boot stuff complete for some stuff.. installing service packs is one thing, there might be others as well.. but if you can't select your boot drive in the bios you might have to overwrite it
[19:36] <Mantas7776> i use ssd to boot windows, i install ubuntu to HDD, so where should i install bootloader?
[19:36] <ixio2b> ssd
[19:36] <escott> Mantas7776, the bootloader needs to be installed to the device that boots, which is configured in your bios
[19:36] <IOmegaZ> hi
[19:36] <Mantas7776> ok
[19:36] <GandalfB> usr13 This is what I've been reading.  http://brunogirin.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/shared-folders-in-ubuntu-with-setgid.html  - from looking at the fstab file, I can't see the ACL is obviously enabled on any partition.  But I can seem to set it on one folder and not the other.   How do I enable it on a folder?  Or disable it?
[19:36] <Slart> Mantas7776: I would install the boot loader to the hdd, and change the BIOS to boot from the hdd as well
[19:37] <Mantas7776> if i do that
[19:37] <Slart> Mantas7776: but the other way works as well
[19:37] <IOmegaZ> i am trying to install ubuntu from the installer i keep getting this error an error occurred
[19:37] <IOmegaZ> list index out of range
[19:37] <IOmegaZ> for more information please see the log file:
[19:37] <Mantas7776> oh nvm then
[19:37] <polix> dimitris: hi there
[19:37] <escott> Mantas7776, i would +1 Slart's comment. I personally don't like cross booting where the bootloader is on one device and the boot information is on the other.
[19:37] <ixio2b> just press f12 at boot and choose the second HDD
[19:37] <Mantas7776> ok im goin to try it now and how many mb i should give to swap?
[19:37] <ixio2b> and install the boot loader on the HDD
[19:37] <Slart> IOmegaZ: sounds like a bug in the installer.. what does the log file say?
[19:38] <ixio2b> Mantas7776 the same size as your RAM
[19:38] <Mantas7776> i have 16 gb so 16 gb swap?
[19:38] <Slart> Mantas7776: you can always add swap later.. twice your RAM or so
[19:38] <GandalfB> usr13 - here is my Fstab http://paste.ubuntu.com/1517813/
[19:38] <ClientAlive> josh_: Asus Transformer Book <- single greatest computer ever to have been created! WOO!! Did you see that ####!
[19:39] <josh_> ClientAlive: the transformer, AFAIK, is an Android device
[19:39] <Slart> Mantas7776: you'll need at least the same amount of swap as your RAM if you're going to use hibernation..
[19:39] <Mantas7776> hmm, i have windows on my other hdd too, can i boot windows from ssd using grub if i install it to hdd and linux to hdd?
[19:39] <Slart> Mantas7776: yes
[19:39] <Mantas7776> so i should install bootloader on hdd and ubuntu too yep?
[19:39] <Slart> Mantas7776: grub is usually pretty good at picking up other os's hanging around on other hard drives
[19:40] <Slart> Mantas7776: that's what I would do.. but installing the boot loader to the ssd will work as well
[19:40] <ClientAlive> josh_: oh yeah? I hadn't gotten that far yet  :p
[19:40] <Mantas7776> so if i install it i need to point it on main hdd not partition?

[19:41] <Mantas7776> yep, Slart?
[19:41] <Slart> Mantas7776: hmm.. I think the boot loader goes on the drive, not on the partition.. not 100% sure though

[19:44] <GandalfB> A general question,  if I want other users to be able to edit files I create in a linux samba share, do I need to edit the umask?
[19:44] <leku> i dont like how the installer doesn't really give you any options
[19:44] <leku> just tries to guess for you
[19:45] <disharmonic> leku, there's an option that gives you full control
[19:45] <josh_> GandalfB: yes.   You'll also need to edit SMB.conf
[19:45] <leku> where in the install processes is that?
[19:45] <josh_> GandalfB: actually, SMB.conf is the better route.  start there

=== moriarty1 is now known as keyser
[19:47] <josh_> GandalfB: I'm not sure.  I used ot use the one through Webmin, which was pretty good, and allowed me to set coerced file permissions
[19:47] <josh_> GandalfB: I haven't hadd to configure samba in a few years, though
[19:47] <gug> oi
[19:47] <NickNi> Slart: If I use the default drivers that come with Ubuntu, my text gets all scrambled like this: http://i.imgur.com/gmRwW.png
[19:47] <gug> oi
[19:48] <gug> jente
[19:48] <GandalfB> josh_: webmin, is that a gui.   were is the samba config stored?
[19:48] <josh_> it's a web-based GUI for server administration
[19:48] <Slart> NickNi: huh.. never seen that before.. it works if you use the nouveau drivers?
[19:48] <Slart> !webmin
[19:48] <ubottu> webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.
[19:49] <NickNi> Slart: That is with the nouveau drivers :)
[19:49] <josh_> Slart: the incompatibility is poltical rather than technical
[19:49] <Slart> NickNi: oh.. have you tried using the nvidia binary drivers then?
[19:49] <NickNi> Slart: So I installed the nvidia-current and ran the nvidia-xconfig and now I can't press reboot, I can't get access to system settings etc.
[19:49] <Slart> josh_: ah.. I've never seen an explanation about what was wrong.. I just figured my system would explode or something
[19:50] <NickNi> Slart: No, can you tell me how? Is it possible setting it up using the terminal? I can't press most of the buttons in the GUI.
[19:50] <josh_> Slart: Webmin has an ubuntu-specific version which works great, it just doesn't get included because Canonical has conflicting commercial relationships
[19:50] <josh_> as well as Debian
[19:50] <Slart> josh_: meh.. and I really liked webmin.. and to think I suffered through that other one.. whatever it was called
[19:50] <polix> Тут є українці?
[19:50] <josh_> well, for Debian it's a sponsor relationship
[19:50] <josh_> but it's the same thing
[19:50] <Slart> josh_: thanks for enlightening me =)
[19:51] <josh_> Slart: it's frustrating, but I gave up the battle back in 2009
[19:51] <Slart> NickNi: setting up nvidias binary driver should be as simple as running sudo apt-get install nvidia-current afaik
[19:52] <disharmonic> josh_, wow. saying that it might cause unexpected problems is kind of underhanded
[19:52] <Slart> NickNi: I always end up blacklisting the nouveau driver though..
[19:52] <josh_> disharmonic: very
[19:52] <NickNi> Hmm, I'll try. Brb.
[19:52] <truexfan81> what version of ubuntu is NickNi running?
[19:52] <josh_> disharmonic: basically, there was a project to replace webmin which originated out of a bunch of Debian Developers
[19:53] <Slart> oops.. I kind of assumed the latest and greatest
[19:53] <josh_> they lobbied and convinced the other DDs that webmin was harmful
[19:53] <josh_> and then ... they never completed their project
[19:53] <josh_> leaving Debian with nothing
[19:53] <NickNi> truexfan81: The newest, 12.10 I think its called? x64
[19:53] <truexfan81> you will have to install some deps first on that version
[19:53] <Slart> NickNi: I'm not sure if you have to install the kernel headers as well..
[19:53] <josh_> further, since Canonical sells its own management console, they're not eager to re-add webmin
[19:54] <truexfan81> NickNi: http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-quetzal-nvidia.html
[19:54] <josh_> so, it's all politics
[19:54] <truexfan81> NickNi: on that link skip to step 2
[19:55] <NuSuey> btw, is there a way to be informed about the new versions of the ATI video drivers? :P no RSS or newsletter ..or something? :D
[19:55] <NickNi> truexfan81: Awesome! Thanks, I'll just grab some food real quick and try it out :)!
[19:55] <truexfan81> ok
[19:55] <truexfan81> that should fix it up
[19:55]  * truexfan81 is unsure why 12.10 did not include those deps
[19:55] <disharmonic> Kinda surprised about Debian. I expected better of them. Canonical not so much

[20:13] <jhutchins_wk> bakis: By which you imply that it had been higher before the update.
[20:13] <guest16>  /tmp on tmpfs is a bad idea http://rwmj.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/tmpfs-considered-harmful/ and there's a reason if is was turned off as default in Debian (therefore Ubuntu)

[20:14] <bakis> jhutchins_wk: precisely. mine was 1920x1080 prior to the update
[20:15] <AndroUser> viking667 : try sudo update-manager -d

[20:17] <viking667> yup. definitely 12.04

[20:17] <viking667> Righ. I need to come back to this... brb in about ten.
[20:18] <asmod4n> viking667: its probably because you disabled it to show non LTS releases

[20:35] <guest16> viking667: check whether the packages that you are interested in keeping upgraded are up to date. You can do it via apt.

[20:37] <acovrig> Tex_Nick, I have that installed, but I don't get all the window animation effects
[20:37] <guest16> Well, at least the ones belonging to the applications that you run mostly.
[20:37] <moes> truexfan81..Thanks will try both
[20:37] <truexfan81> if that doesn't work i think i found 1 more
[20:37] <guest16> There's little or nothing that the distro upgrade does besides upgrading the packages and the kernel image (which is downloaded as a package as well).
[20:38] <usr13> viking667: Ok, so what is your question?
[20:39] <guest16> My guess is, nothing, but I might be wrong.
[20:39] <r5a> question. i accidently deleted my partition off lvm so now my ubuntu 12.10 boots to initramfs busybox with saying /dev/mapper/hostname missing
[20:39] <r5a> anything i can do?
[20:39] <r5a> the disk wasn't deleted or formatted just the partition i think was nuked
[20:40] <viking667> well, I want to upgrade FROM 12.04 TO 12.10... upgrade manager isn't interested in showing me 12.10, neither is the underlying do-release-upgrade
[20:40] <asmod4n> you could restore the partition with gptfdisk if it wouldn't be lvm.
[20:40] <acovrig> Tex_Nick, compiz-fusion-plugins-extra doesn't exist in the repository, and I installed the deb on https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/amd64/compiz-fusion-plugins-extra/0.9.7.0~bzr9-0ubuntu7 and I still don't have the options
[20:40] <Spikes> Guys, if i'm configuring postfix for multi-domain server what should i use as my "system mail name"?
[20:40] <blbrown_win3> what is a good virtual machine for ubuntu.  I have used vmware on windows and am fine with it.  But I was curious if that is the best choice.  I want anything that has good framerates, speed
[20:40] <asmod4n> viking667: you have disabled upgrading to a non LTS release.
[20:40] <blbrown_win3> virtual box?
[20:40] <eutheria> hello, today deja-dup let me down and i want a more reliable backup solution
[20:40] <viking667> at this stage, it appears that my remaining options appear to be: change the sources to quantal instead, then do a apt-get upgrade and a distupgrade
[20:41] <eutheria> can anyone suggest anything?
[20:41] <viking667> asmod4n: uhm, how?
[20:41] <k1l_> guest16: afaik the updaate manager does more than just changing the sources. in some upgrade it did change stuff because the newer version used some other system daemons or the grub2 stuff etc
[20:41] <viking667> I've already explained /etc/update-manager/blah
[20:41] <asmod4n> viking667: its the default, you have to enable upgrading to a unstable release by turning it on in the update manager
[20:41] <usr13> If you've changed from "Long term support releases only" to "Normal releases", that should do the trick.  You might additionally need to do "apt-get update"  but other than that, you should be good to go.  (Actually, I'd first do "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade"  and then reboot if told to and then you can go on with the distribution upgrade.)
[20:41] <viking667> asmod4n: I already did.
[20:41] <compdoc> blbrown_win3, if video speed is what you want, virtualbox is very good at that
[20:41] <viking667> aready DID both of those.
[20:42] <usr13> viking667: Was that for me?
[20:42] <asmod4n> then its just a apt-get update and do-release-upgrade
[20:42] <viking667> I'm getting 0 of 0 packages to upgrade.
[20:42] <usr13> viking667: Ok that is good.
[20:42] <blbrown_win3> compdoc how would you compared that vmware, better?  worse?  about the same
[20:42] <viking667> do-release-upgrade tells me "no new release found" but I'm only on 12.04.1
[20:42] <viking667> and I _KNOW_ that 12.10 is out.
[20:43] <Tex_Nick> acovrig : you'll need someone more knowledgeable than myself then, sorry ... hey keep asking someone here can help you ;)
[20:43] <guest16_> Yes, but the real upgrade is the packages versions... just do some sampling
[20:43] <compdoc> blbrown_win3, I use qemu-kvm for my servers, which dont require fast video. I've only tried virtualbox, so cant compare
[20:43] <asmod4n> your on a server and want to go to 12.10? good luck with that, after one week of constant crashes everywhere i am going back to 12.04.2
[20:43] <acovrig> I was able to install compiz-fusion-plugins-extra in 32bit 12.04, how do I install it in 12.10 64bit?
[20:44] <viking667> I'm not on a server.
[20:44] <viking667> well, I'm not specifically on a "server" release.
[20:44] <asmod4n> its somewhere hidden in the update settings on unity
[20:44] <usr13> viking667: pastebinit /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades
[20:45] <asmod4n> where you manage the updates you want to install like multiverse and such
[20:45] <viking667> asmod4n: sigh. I'm not using unity. Can't stand it, frankly
[20:45] <Slart> viking667: could it be that it is looking for a new LTS release? 12.04 was LTS
[20:45] <Tex_Nick> acovrig : have you tried installing compiz-plugins from synaptic ?
[20:45] <viking667> Slart: doesn't quite count in this case, as I have it looking for normal releases.
[20:45] <asmod4n> or any other GUI, its where you manage what updates to install
[20:45] <usr13> viking667: Or just do:  tail -n1 /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades    and tell us what it says.
[20:46] <Slart> viking667: ok, just a thought
[20:47] <asmod4n> but once you go away from a LTS release you can't go back
[20:47] <asmod4n> other than reinstall
[20:47] <usr13> asmod4n: Good point.
[20:47] <asmod4n> and i haven't have problems with LTS releases for a decade now

[21:45] <jrib> fag: first, did you install drivers for your graphics card?
[21:45] <fag> I recently got a new piece of hardware to run my Minecraft/Web Server on, and I am having problems with the resolution. At first I thought it was my graphics card, when I first booted up Ubuntu it said it was running in some sort of compatibility mode so it didn't recognize my graphics card. I did "sudo apt-get install mesa-utils" and now it recognizes my graphics card. But I can only change the resolution to either 1024x768 or 800x600.
[21:45] <viking667> It's ... usable.

[22:25] <bekks> questionaire: What exactly happened? How did you delete it?
[22:26] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: Restore your backup.
[22:26] <chamunks> is there a good guide on how to run vhosts in a lamp server?
[22:26] <glebihan> nickwebcouk, curl http://newaddress/ip.php?ip=`curl ip.me/ip`
[22:26] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: there is no backup....
[22:26] <jhutchins_wk> chamunks: Depends on the server.  Drupal has it's own scheme and allows multiple hosts on one code install.
[22:26] <chamunks> oh really
[22:26] <jhutchins_wk> chamunks: Others you have to do the full PHP code for each VHost.
[22:26] <chamunks> well i have two vanity pages I need to host.
[22:27] <chamunks> one for my internet nick (chamunks) and one for my RL name
[22:27] <cmj141> jhutchins_wk : ok so basically Ubuntu Tweak might mess something up? I'll just keep the older kernel then for safety and delete the oldest and i should gtg
[22:27] <gdc77> nickwebcouk: i'm looking...
[22:27] <jhutchins_wk> cmj141: Since it's easy to get the old kernel back (your network is working), no reason to keep it around.
[22:27] <nickwebcouk> glebihan: that works.
[22:28] <glebihan> nickwebcouk, sure does
[22:28] <nickwebcouk> glebihan: absolutely perfectly... Thsi goes in a handy snippet! Thanks!
[22:28] <glebihan> nickwebcouk, you're welcome
[22:28] <questionaire> bekks: there was some problem with booting.....i was looking into bios but accidently pushed format option......with its progress it looked like quick format.....but then i canceled it by pressing main power button
[22:28] <cmj141> jhutchins_wk : is it easy? :-x
[22:29] <InspectorCluseau> cmj141, as stated earlier ... you can use the package manager to safely remove things
[22:29] <cmj141> im not aware of how easy because never had a problem with a kernel
[22:29] <gdc77> nickcouk: it looks good but i don't think it works, ip.me/ip does not give an ip address directly
[22:29] <jhutchins_wk> cmj141: Yeah, just aptitude remove or use the GUI.
[22:29] <bekks> questionaire: Then just try testdisk - maybe it can find something to restore. Otherwise thats not that tragically, since you dont have data worth to be backed up, on the other hand.
[22:30] <chamunks> jhutchins_wk, would it not just be as simple as editing some apache conf to point different incoming domains to different directories in  my filestructure?
[22:30] <gdc77> nickcouk: what you need is probably icanhazip.com/ip
[22:31] <questionaire> bekks: it was important data...i had no backups....my bad
[22:31] <nickwebcouk> gdc77: it was to keep it minimal in chate, the full command that works (Thanks to glebihan!) is curl http://www.site.com/script.php?ip=`curl http://ifconfig.me/ip`
[22:31] <cmj141> roger... thanks fellas! Ill look into Ubuntu Tweak with a careful eye, but most likely remove it myself
[22:31] <nickwebcouk> gdc77: and I have a custom PHP script which writes that to a file on my server. Yidier than an email every time a cron job runs!
[22:32] <gdc77> nickwebcouk: ah, that makes sense, alternatively you could set up some dynamic dns and run that on your server directly
[22:32] <glebihan> nickwebcouk, yeah, figured it wasn't the real addresses, http://newaddress/ didn't look right ;)
[22:32] <InspectorCluseau> cmj141, there are a lot more files than just those in /boot
[22:32] <gdc77> nickwebcouk: dyndns.com
[22:32] <aguitel> gdc77, this is my graphic:NVIDIA Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5200]
[22:32] <jhutchins_wk> chamunks: It depends on the software you're using.  That works for plain apache.
=== macppcgal-b is now known as tripelb
[22:32] <nickwebcouk> glebihan: really, your a legend! Thanks again!
[22:33] <glebihan> nickwebcouk, no problem
[22:33] <questionaire> bekks: how to recover full partition or disk ?
[22:33] <chamunks> jhutchins_wk, im hoping for simplicity im not looking to be a blogger just have a few profile pages hosted and reverse proxied through cloudflare.
[22:34] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: how to recover full partition or disk ?
[22:34] <wbf> is that a spam attack?
[22:34] <wbf> Hello?
[22:34] <novaspirit> anyone know whom or where i have to contact to get rights to post on ubuntu's wiki? or name of my ubuntu image? example https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/TEGRA/AC100
[22:34] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: The short answer is you can't.
[22:35] <noukist> shortpath :p
[22:35] <novaspirit> i created a fully working port for asus transformer and read that i'm not allowed to use "ubuntu" in the name due to trademark
[22:35] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: It does depend on the filesystem, but ext is very hard to recover.  There is a program called photorec that may be able to recover some of the files, but that's all I know about it.
[22:35] <bekks> questionaire: Read this very carefully before you start recovering: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DataRecovery
[22:36] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: bekks file system was ntfs or fat32
[22:36] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: bekks it was win7 disk
[22:36] <wbf> novaspirit, make it novaOS
[22:37] <novaspirit> wbf that's a good name
[22:37] <novaspirit> wbf, how do i get to post on ubuntu like https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/TEGRA/AC100?
[22:37] <gdc77> aguitel: i think that repository is for almost all nvidia cards
[22:37] <jhutchins_wk> bekks: Wow, it's come a long way.
[22:37] <gdc77> aguitel: here's another discussion: http://askubuntu.com/questions/153915/how-to-install-drivers-for-nvidia-geforce-fx-5200-on-precise
[22:38] <aguitel> gdc77, nvidia-current is correct for me?
[22:38] <gdc77> aguitel: i think so, whatever it says to do should be it
[22:38] <musca> novaspirit: finding legal names is a pita.
[22:38] <bekks> questionaire: Then just start reading the article I'ven given to you.
[22:38] <gdc77> aguitel: maybe check the second link too
[22:38] <gdc77> aguitel: yeah i think that's it
[22:39] <questionaire> bekks: yea already reading it
[22:39] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: The methods on that page could work, or you could ask in ##windows.  Windows recovery programs are likely not free.
[22:39] <aguitel> gdc77, ok i will try
[22:39] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: hmm...ok but 1st i will read page then will proceed
[22:39] <CrestedNewt> questionaire, I know that it is windows based but have a look at http://www.runtime.org/data-recovery-software.htm as I have used this before and it works very well but is not quick
[22:39] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: When it says to install software, you need to install it to the live system or whatever you are doing the recovery with, not the device you are trying to recover.
[22:39] <CrestedNewt> questionaire, also it is not free
[22:40] <gdc77> aguitel: good luck, i hate graphics issues too lol
[22:40] <wbf> novaspirit, I am as proud of myself as you are, I got ubuntu working on a UG802
[22:41] <bekks> questionaire: If you REALLY need that data, take a look at this: http://www.krollontrack.com/ -- contact them for free for a quick free online quote.
[22:41] <Vjarjadian> anyone got a suggestion for disk imaging software they use with Linux, something equivalent to Acronis True Image or Norton Ghost but within Ubuntu...
[22:41] <novaspirit> wbf i got a mk802
[22:41]  * viking667 found a project to get Android programs working under Ubuntu with hardware acceleration of graphics... nice.
[22:41] <jhutchins_wk> Varazir: dd
[22:41] <wbf> novaspirit, did you know you can run ubuntu on it? :D
[22:42] <jhutchins_wk> Varazir: If you want an elaborate shell to manage it, clonezilla.
[22:42] <TurdFerguson> I have a couple questions
[22:42]  * noukist bb ppl
[22:42] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: CrestedNewt bekks i have recovered few lil files and folders here and there...so familier with basics but never gone for a full disk recovery that too on linux...also previous files were not mine but this is my own disk thats why concerned
[22:42] <novaspirit> wbf, yup but no hardware acceleration
[22:42] <bekks> questionaire: Then call a professional data recovery specialist.
[22:43] <wbf> novaspirit, Well my UG802 works great with ubuntu
[22:43] <novaspirit> wbf, and it's a bit underpowered
[22:43] <TurdFerguson> I have a Microsoft LifeCam webcam but the installation disc (obviously) only works with Windows... is there any way I can make this webcam work with Ubuntu?
[22:43] <cmj141> InspectorCluseau : so youre saying to use Ubuntu Tweak to get those other files ?
[22:43] <novaspirit> wbf, ug802 i think it's dual core?
[22:43] <novaspirit> wbf, much stronger then mine
[22:44] <questionaire> bekks: yea i will go for a paid recovery but trying me 1st will damage more or will be ok for me to go ahead ?
[22:44] <CrestedNewt> questionaire, well you can download the software for free and run it. DO NOT INSTALL it on the drive you want to recover from. If that brings back nothing, you are looking at specialist recovery which will not be cheap
[22:44] <wbf> novaspirit, had to flash mine with the kernel manually just to put ubuntu on it
[22:45] <zzillezz> Why is my broadcom wifi chip not working anymore with most recent kernel update in ubuntu ?
[22:45] <novaspirit> wbf same with me. i created two kernels a 2.6x and 3.1x
[22:45] <novaspirit> wbf overclocked
[22:45] <questionaire> CrestedNewt: hmm.....currently i am stuck badly so no option....will keep in mind warnings and precautions
[22:45] <TurdFerguson> can anyone answer my question please?
[22:45] <novaspirit> wbf for the mk802 i had to overclock it just to run xbmc
[22:46] <viking667> what's a mk802?
[22:46] <krabador> i can'r
[22:46] <bekks> questionaire: EVERYTHING you do to that disk might damage it even more. Create a COMPLETE image of it, if you know how to do so, or call a data recovery specialist.
[22:47] <TurdFerguson> i know there's a lot going on here but could someone look at my question?
[22:47] <krabador> i can't stop lightdm on 12.10 , to reinstall manually nvidia173 drivers
[22:47] <CrestedNewt> questionaire, bekks could be right here. If it is a head crash, you could be damaging the surface of the platter which means no recovery possible
[22:47] <viking667> turd: plug it in, see what Linux says.
[22:47] <krabador> how i con?
[22:48] <viking667> krabador: "stop lightdm"
[22:48] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, give me a few mins. Plug it in first and "lsusb" in terminal
[22:48] <TurdFerguson> did that
[22:48] <viking667> and?
[22:48] <CrestedNewt> turdferguson, and what did you get back?
[22:48] <questionaire> bekks: CrestedNewt nothing crashed....but i was solving some boot issues....it was late and was sleepy so accidently pushed format button.....i know image creation process
[22:49] <krabador> viking667, i've "unknown instance"
[22:49] <TurdFerguson> came up on  Bus 001 Device 003: ID 045e:076d Microsoft Corp. LifeCam HD-5000
[22:49] <bekks> questionaire: Then create an image and run testdisk on the image.
[22:49] <viking667> krabador: are you sure you're not running gdm instead then?
[22:49] <questionaire> bekks: ok
[22:50] <TurdFerguson> i just need to know if i can get this software to work
[22:50] <krabador> viking667, i'm in ctrl-alt-f1 terminal,
[22:50] <Guest24527> does ubuntu 12.04 has classic desktop environment?
[22:50] <viking667> turd: try cheese... if that works, you're good to go.
[22:50] <CrestedNewt> Turdferguson, look at https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/113698
[22:50] <viking667> Guest24527: it should do. I'm running that now.
[22:50] <krabador> viking667 and stop gdm give me "unknown job"
[22:51] <viking667> hm. What does "ps ax | grep dm | grep -v grep" tell you?
[22:51] <omistaja> how good ubuntu handless hdmi output if need someday?
[22:52] <CrestedNewt> questionaire, in that case... dare I say it... install Windows on a different disk. download and install trial of the runtime software. Run it against the drive you formatted and see what it returns. if it returns lots of directories, you can then purchase the software
[22:52] <TurdFerguson> this guide is kinda vague CrestedNewt
[22:52] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: Backups.  Any time you're messing with partitions especially.
[22:52] <pedahzur> Is there a server for deprecated Ubuntu distros?  We have a dapper server that we are working on upgrading, but in the meantime still need to install some packages on it.  Packages for dapper aren't available on archive.ubuntu.com, of course.  Does Ubuntu have something similar to CentOS's vault.centos.org?
[22:52] <cmj141> hey guys is that Ubuntu Tweak still active? I dont see it in the package manager.. i see a Tweak Hex Editor and Computer Janitor.. but no Ubuntu Tweak
[22:52] <BillyZane> hi everyone, i am a complete n00b in *nix. I need very basic help in deciding how to go about entering the ubuntu community. Question: do I need a swap partition? can I run everything off just 1 partition? how big should this partition be?
[22:52] <jhutchins_wk> !oldrelease
[22:53] <jhutchins_wk> Rats.
[22:53] <TurdFerguson> CrestedNewt: the guide you sent doesn't really apply to me
[22:53] <pedahzur> http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ Sweet.
[22:53] <gdc77> pedahzur: i don't mean to avoid your question, but it will be far easier for you to reinstall than try to upgrade it
[22:53] <cmj141> Billy Zane the actor
[22:53] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: yea...i know...but i dont know backup sync.....all i do is backup folders manually which is a lot of work.....still i do it for important files but this time i got late
[22:53] <jhutchins_wk> !tell pedahzur about eol
[22:53] <ubottu> pedahzur, please see my private message
[22:53] <BillyZane> yes, that is me, you may have remembered my movies like the phantom
[22:54] <questionaire> CrestedNewt: ok....i can do that
[22:54] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, I had an old creative webcam. from the lsusb command, I then did a search on "Ubuntu 045e:076d" and I found a compatible driver for it
[22:54] <pedahzur> gdc, jhutchins_wk: Yes, I know. We are moving off this server, but need a couple additions in the mean time. Thus, the reason for question.
[22:54] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: It would be worth while to learn some backup techniques, maybe build some scripts or install a backup utility.
[22:54] <TurdFerguson> i don't need a DRIVER, I need the program on the disc
[22:55] <cmj141> haha... nah just that island movie where he gets killed and stuffed into a room under the floor lol
[22:55] <TurdFerguson> that lets me record videos
[22:55] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: You're going to put more time into this recovery than doing that would have cost.  Not to nag, but it's important.
[22:55] <gdc77> pedazhur: i'd be cautious about everything, a machine that old might be on the brink of hardware failure as well
[22:55] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, with the driver, ubuntu then takes control of the camera. you do not need the software
[22:55] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: lead me....i will love to follow you
[22:55] <TurdFerguson> yes i do, the software had its own video recorder
[22:56] <TurdFerguson> and it controlled the camera's stupid auto zoom
[22:56] <gdc77> pedazhur: unless someone put a really old distro on a new machine, lol
[22:56] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: I've used rdiff-backup, but mostly I just rsync my data tree to a second device.
[22:57] <pedahzur> gdc77: Yeah, thus the reason we're moving off of it.:)
[22:57] <Guest24527> does ubuntu 12.04 has classic desktop environment?
[22:57] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: A lot of my friends use crashplan.
[22:57] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: i have heard rsunc but never used it
[22:57] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: what about ubuntu inbuilt backup utility ?
[22:58] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: Yeah, that's good.  There are a lot of good options, the hardest part is picking which one is right for you and customizing it to your needs.
[22:58] <TurdFerguson> CrestedNewt: so you're telling me ubuntu has video recording stuff just like what's on the disc?
[22:58] <bekks> questionaire: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/backups.html
[22:58] <CrestedNewt> Turdferguson - well until you have something that allows the OS to work with the WebCam, we can't try anything else.
[22:58] <tripelb> Have 2002 powerpc iMac 384M RAM and booting the "12.04 desktop ppc-mac liveCD" (Precise)  starts up with a text screen, but gives no chance to check disk integrity,. After that, from that shell, all my tries to boot ubuntu from the liveCD are UNsuccessful. Anyone up for helping?
[22:58] <questionaire> bekks: thnx
[22:59] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: If you work on different machines all the time, clonezilla is great to snapshot the machine before you start.
[22:59] <TurdFerguson> but this is creative webcam live
[22:59] <wbf> novaspirit, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1518499/ is the link to the pics of the UG802 running linux. PS: it's in the paste
[22:59] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: Boot to the CD, back up to local device or network, off you go.
[22:59] <CrestedNewt> Turdferguson, I've just had a look in the software centre for 'webcam' and there are a fair few apps that are available
[22:59] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: yea lot of machines...
[22:59] <TurdFerguson> well in the link you sent, someone suggested this link http://bordet.blogspot.com/2009/01/creative-webcam-live-on-ubuntu-intrepid.html
[23:00] <jhutchins_wk> questionaire: If you're managing a datacenter or a lot of desktops then something like amanda might be a good idea.
[23:00] <tripelb> BillyZane: are you still needing help?
[23:00] <jhutchins_wk> Anyway, I'm off for home.
[23:00] <TurdFerguson> i can't put in a command before opening a prtogram with it if i can't even use it lol
[23:01] <TurdFerguson> k i just tried it with skype and it seems to work
[23:01] <TurdFerguson> but i need that software or else this camera is useless
[23:01] <omistaja> try cheese
[23:01] <questionaire> jhutchins_wk: ok....amanda
[23:02] <CrestedNewt> Turdferguson, you said earlier it was a MS Livecam. itmakes no odds as the important thing here is the Device ID 045e:076d
[23:02] <TurdFerguson> ok
[23:03] <TurdFerguson> i just can't fetch the software from the disc
[23:03] <TurdFerguson> which has been my main question all along
[23:04] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson - software on disk if for a Windows Installation but you want to use it on Ubuntu. It's a bit like putting Diesel into a Petrol car
[23:04] <TurdFerguson> i figured there was some program that could translate it over or something
[23:04] <TurdFerguson> i dunno
[23:05] <TurdFerguson> i shouldn't have ever installed ubuntu lol, this is kinda lame
[23:05] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, you could try and use Wine - look for it in the Software Centre
[23:05] <TurdFerguson> i want to take the time to learn it but it's incompatible with so many things
[23:05] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson - one day you will see the light :D
[23:05] <devnill> ^
[23:06] <goddard> dr_willis: yo
[23:06] <wbf> TurdFerguson, Look at Mint. that has the most drivers
[23:06] <devnill> linux is not windows and if you expect the experience to be the same, it might not be for you
[23:06] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, not at all. I am using Scanners that no longer work with Windows as well as some webcams.
[23:06] <goddard> dr_willis: yo
[23:06] <wbf> devnill, Exactly!
[23:06] <TurdFerguson> not sure i get what wine des by its description
[23:07] <TurdFerguson> yah devnill, got that
[23:07] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, granted re windows experience. Wine allows you to run most windows programs under Linux
[23:07] <devnill> what programs do you want?
[23:07] <devnill> there are a lot of good alternatives
[23:07] <TurdFerguson> ehhh
[23:07] <bond__> Does anybody here know about how to check what is the TCP initial window size taken by ubuntu?
[23:07] <TurdFerguson> is it q4wine?
[23:08] <devnill> games and graphic design are the weak points
[23:08] <questionaire> CrestedNewt: i tried running yahoo messenger under wine but it only crashed ?
[23:08] <devnill> questionaire: can't you use pidgin?
[23:08] <wbf> TurdFerguson, Actually there are some good games like Q3rally
[23:08] <questionaire> am i alone having this problem ?
[23:08] <devnill> steam is getting pretty good
[23:08] <blami> bond__: cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling
[23:08] <devnill> open beta!
[23:08] <TurdFerguson> which wine is it?
[23:08] <dr_willis> questionaire:  theres alternatives to  the Official Yahoo Messenger ap0p.
[23:08] <dr_willis> !wine
[23:08] <ubottu> WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[23:08] <questionaire> devnill: i tried it for yahoo cam....
[23:09] <devnill> ah
[23:09] <devnill> yeah, i can't help you there
[23:09] <devnill> I use skype :-/
[23:10] <TurdFerguson> yeah it tells me to install "wine" but there is nothing named just "wine"
[23:10] <omistaja> soon everyoneone has to use skype
[23:10] <bond__> blami: tcp_window_scaling has the boolean value, right? How will it then tell the initial window size?
[23:10] <questionaire> dr_willis: suggest alternatives with yahoo cam support
=== Afterraff` is now known as Afteraffekt
[23:10] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, wait 1 let me find it for you
[23:11] <TurdFerguson> i can send a screenshot of what i see
[23:11] <Basketball> what is pear linux support channel
[23:12] <CrestedNewt> Turdferguson, search for "Wine Windows Program Loader"
[23:12] <TurdFerguson> here's a screenshot of what I see when I type wine http://imagebin.org/242452
[23:12] <skp1> turdferguson. what kind of name is that.
[23:13] <TurdFerguson> a random nickname
[23:13] <TurdFerguson> who gives a damn?
[23:13] <TurdFerguson> so this MIGHT let me get files from windows discs?
[23:13] <CrestedNewt> Turdferguson,5th one down
[23:13] <blami> bond__: ah ... it should be in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem
[23:13] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson - MIGHT is the right word here
[23:13] <blami> bond__: and /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem respectively
[23:14] <TurdFerguson> excellent
[23:14] <questionaire> devnill: how to install skype on 12.10......doing sudo apt-get install skype is no help
[23:14] <TurdFerguson> thank you
[23:14] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, no probs
[23:14] <blami> bond__: try maybe things changed a little ... it should be mentioned in man tcp
[23:14] <bloony> my gf got a linux mint install.. but it doesnt work to login as her regular user.. I tried logging in as root and resetting her password with passwd, but still no luck.. it shows some shell, but its too quick so I cannot read what it says.. she doesnt update her packages too often so I updated 156 packages just before I rebooted.. how can I debug this?
[23:14] <TurdFerguson> one last question, would this let me install camtasia?
[23:14] <xangua> !partner
[23:14] <xangua> questionaire: did you enable the partner repository¿
[23:14] <ubottu> Canonical's partner repositories provide a location for software vendors to publish applications. The repo itself can be added by running this in a !terminal: « sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner" »
[23:14] <xangua> !mint | bloony
[23:14] <ubottu> bloony: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[23:14] <bloony> ah ok
[23:14] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, BUT, you will need to get Ubuntu talking to the device first, do you will need the driver
[23:14] <questionaire> xangua: main restricted universe and multiverse are enabled and updated
[23:14] <TurdFerguson> or any other video editing software
[23:15] <TurdFerguson> my cam driver?
[23:15] <bond__> blami: that was my confusion. actually tcp_rmem is the buffer size and some part of it is reserved for application buffer. now the thing is that how to calculate the exact size?
[23:15] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, yes, the cam driver. Also, have you looked at Ubuntu Studio?
[23:16] <questionaire> hmm
[23:16] <TurdFerguson> not yet, is it good?
[23:16] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, lots of video editing stuff built into that distro as well as music
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[23:16] <TurdFerguson> ooh
[23:17] <TurdFerguson> is it in the software center or can it be installed by terminal?
[23:17] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, I believe that most of this is available in the Software centre anyway
[23:18] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, I don't know the answer to that I'm afraid. I have it as a distro
[23:18] <TurdFerguson> says here its installed by software image http://ubuntustudio.org/2012/10/ubuntu-studio-12-10-quantal-quentzal-release-notes/
[23:18] <TurdFerguson> that's weird
[23:19] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, I'm not sure but the repositories that the SW Centre points to may be different between Ubuntu and Ubuntu Studio - someone else may know
[23:19] <TurdFerguson> hmm
[23:19] <blami> bond__: afaik receiver buffer size determines window size
[23:19] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, that is how I installed it
[23:19] <TurdFerguson> i don't see much for the ubuntu studio in SW center
[23:20] <TurdFerguson> you installed it via cd image?
[23:20] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, but stick to the LTS version as 12:10 may not be stable for what you want it to do.
[23:20] <blami> bond__: I mean the buffer size determines maximal requestable window size
[23:20] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, Download the Image and use "Startup Disk Creator" to write the image to a USB stick. Boot from the USB
[23:21] <blami> bond__: I am pretty sure that kernel doubles rmem_max value to be able to address a slight overhead there
[23:21] <TurdFerguson> can i use a disc instead? don't have a usb stick handy, just an ext hard drive
[23:21] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, I don't see why not, but the process will erase everything on that disk
[23:22] <TurdFerguson> i have blank dvds
[23:22] <TurdFerguson> also, none of these say LTS http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/releases/
[23:22] <bond__> blami: well, the documentation says that tcp_adv_win_scale and tcp_app_win decides the window size. I am having hard time figuring out how.
[23:22] <BillyZane> tripelb: Hi! i'm sorry for leaving, poop time and breakfast. AHhh. that was good
[23:22] <BillyZane> tripelb: yes, i do still need help
[23:22] <blami> bond__: application still can override default (up to rmem_max) using some attribute of setsockopt
[23:22] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, in which case, use a DVD. Use version 12.04
[23:23] <bond__> blami: Thats why i just need to know initial size.
[23:23] <TurdFerguson> hokay
[23:23] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, wouldn't get this help from MS :D
=== belko is now known as Guest61446
[23:23] <TurdFerguson> probably not
[23:24] <TurdFerguson> without paying an arm and a nut
[23:24] <blami> bond__: but tcp_adv_win_scale is only application portion of window afaik
[23:24] <Alcabradolic> Hello?
[23:25] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, I 'was' a MS specialist and am fed up with how things are going. now I use Ubuntu for mostthings
[23:25] <Alcabradolic> Can somebody please push me in the right direction on choosing a distro for a netbook, not necessarily ubuntu, please.
[23:25] <TurdFerguson> i just need to learn more about it, are there any beginner guides and lessons and things like that?
[23:25] <TurdFerguson> i've seen a few but they're kind of vague to my eyes
[23:26] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, it's a state of mind. Stick with it and you will end up loving it. I haven't looked for any but I'm a tech head anyway
[23:26] <TurdFerguson> holy balls ubuntu studio is 2 gigs
[23:26] <TurdFerguson> gotcha
[23:26] <CrestedNewt> TurdFerguson, good luck!!
[23:26] <wbf> TurdFerguson, that's because UBUNTU studio has over 50 PROGRAMS
[23:26] <Alcabradolic> Turd, what's your interest? Are you producing music, or film?
[23:26] <bond__> blami: yes, for some particular download in some application, the window will always follow slow start, right? thats why we need to include this parameter too.
[23:26] <blami> bond__: anyway you can try it, do a local loop and tcpdump it
[23:27] <blami> bond__: correct
[23:27] <TurdFerguson> it hasn't even downloaded a mb yet, and i have good internet
[23:27] <TurdFerguson> weird
[23:27] <wbf> TurdFerguson, did you know STEAM is for linux now?
[23:27] <TurdFerguson> 9 hours left... lol now 10 hours
[23:28] <CrestedNewt> Alcabradolic - have a look at Puppy Linux - very very low overheads
[23:28] <TurdFerguson> i heard about that yes
[23:28] <wbf> TurdFerguson, I have it. and tf2 runs fast
[23:28] <WanderingEnder> Anyone familiar with using Ubuntu on Azure?
[23:28] <Alcabradolic> Thanks CrestedNewt. I actually tried to install BrowserLinux earlier this evening -- a puplet.
[23:28] <TurdFerguson> sweet
[23:28] <WanderingEnder> I'm specifically wondering if its worth using on the small tier.
[23:28] <WanderingEnder> (1 core, 1.75GB RAM)
[23:28] <CrestedNewt> Alcabradolic - no probs
[23:29] <TurdFerguson> are ubuntu's servers acting up today?
[23:29] <Alcabradolic> I attempted an install from a USB stick to my harddrive, but can't seem to find the necessary files that it needed from the Live CD, namely vmlinuz etc.
[23:29] <bond__> blami: but that wont help if i want to change it. Thats why I am trying to decode rmem into things
[23:29] <TurdFerguson> this thing just went from 5 hours remaining to 20 hours in 5 minutes
[23:29] <Alcabradolic> I've done plenty of Google-Fu, but the clearest answer was "find a USB cd drive" -- which I don't have!
[23:29] <truexfan404> time to disable Java plugins again, this one does affect linux
[23:29] <truexfan404> http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/10/us-java-security-idUSBRE90919X20130110
[23:30] <Egon> truexfan404: Yeah, like lfan is to believe
[23:31] <Egon> it it not exactly a reliable source
[23:31] <truexfan404> ah ok
[23:31] <TurdFerguson> i've never had anything download this slowly
[23:31] <blami> bond__: bud rmem only says one thing - a half of receive buffer size
[23:31] <TurdFerguson> ubuntu studio is downloading at 25KB/s in chrome
[23:32] <TurdFerguson> well, never since dial up anyway
[23:32] <CrestedNewt> Turdferguson, don't know. I'm still running US 11.xx can't remember :D
[23:32] <magiK_> wow, I just sudo apt-get xubuntu-desktop this thing flies like the wind.
[23:32] <Egon> TurdFerguson: i have never used chrome, but might i suggest you try a webkit bowser, firefox or even opera
[23:32] <Alcabradolic> Egon, Chrome is a webkit browser ?
[23:32] <Egon> yes and no
[23:33] <bentinata> Do somebody here know how to edit Epiphany?
[23:33] <truexfan404> Egon: do you mean reuters is not a reliable source?
[23:33] <Egon> chrome is at its base the same webkit as safari and konqueror, but they have a different js egngine and lots of more changes
[23:33] <Alcabradolic> Aha. Thanks for the correction.
[23:34] <TurdFerguson> frefox is downloading this thing much faster
[23:34] <TurdFerguson> holy shit
[23:34] <bond__> blami: check 3.3.21 here http://www.frozentux.net/ipsysctl-tutorial/chunkyhtml/tcpvariables.html
[23:34] <Egon> truexfan404: no not at all, i mean that is the same gauy that claimed OSS was dead.
[23:34] <Egon> that particular repoter has his head up his a**
[23:34] <Ziber> Is there an easy way to upgrade to mysql 5.5 on 11.04 server?
[23:35] <Egon> Ziber: mysql PPA
[23:35] <jrib> !11.04 | Ziber
[23:35] <ubottu> Ziber: Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) was the fourteenth release of Ubuntu. Desktop support ended on October 28, 2012. See !upgrade, !lts and !eol for more details.
[23:35] <jrib> Ziber: 11.04 is no longer supported, you should upgrade right away
[23:36] <Egon> jrib: does not matter, be kind
[23:36] <jrib> Egon: it certainly matters
[23:36] <Egon> it is not like anyone in here gets payed to support anyways
[23:36] <jrib> Egon: oh.  No, it matters because it means he isn't getting security updates.
[23:36] <Egon> and yes you can upgrade mysql via ppa\s
[23:36] <magiK_> Xubuntu is so much faster,  I'm really impressed with this.
[23:36] <wbf> I gtg gonna play TF2 now
[23:37] <Ziber> how would i use ppas?
[23:37] <Ziber> what is/are ppas anyway?
[23:37] <jrib> Ziber: did you see what I told you about 11.04 no longer being supported? That means you aren't getting security updates for example.  You should upgrade
[23:38] <Ziber> I'm upgrading at the moment...
[23:38] <Ziber> Still a valid question. What is/are PPAs?
[23:38] <Egon> jrib: Does it matter to you? He asked how to uppgrade one particular software package. You answer was the classical arch attitude "upgrade the entire os" Maybe he only need that part to be satisfied.
[23:38] <jrib> Ziber: then take care of upgrading first; you'll likely end up with the mysql version you want
[23:38] <jrib> Egon: I'm informing him that 11.04 is no longer supported.
[23:38] <Ziber> I'm really done putting up with assholes today. :/
[23:39] <Egon> good point, but still.. what he asked is very simple to accomplish without upgrades
[23:39] <BillyZane> me too, damn it, i wish i was in love. sorry
[23:39] <BillyZane> can anyone help me?
[23:39] <BillyZane> not with love, but a ubuntu question
[23:39] <Ziber> So, how to upgrade mysql?
[23:40] <Slart> BillyZane: what's the question?
[23:40] <jrib> Egon: that's fine.  But the point is he is using an unsupported release.  He may not be aware of that.  And if he upgrades to a supported release he may no longer need to worry about his original questsion.
[23:40] <Egon> BillyZane: asking about asking a question is a loop and will never be answered
[23:40] <BillyZane> egon, i asked earlier and it wasn't answered, so.. yeah
[23:40] <BillyZane> but you are right egon
[23:40] <goddard> my system takes 140 seconds to start
[23:40] <goddard> hey can some one help me with this boot chart http://i1337.photobucket.com/albums/o667/Ryein/goddard-G73Jw-quantal-20121203-1_zps93aa7231.png
[23:40] <BillyZane> here is my question: i am a n00b. i want to start learning how to use linux, i mean i am totally clue less
[23:41] <jrib> Ziber: i'm telling you about the support status for your own benefit.  It's dangerous to run an unsupported release because you aren't getting security updates
[23:41] <Egon> BillyZane: what did you ask then? not all of us have littograpichal memory
[23:41] <Bizzeh> hi, i am looking to set up a server at my office. i would like all machines within the office to boot from that server and have the machines have to log in based on a set of login details held on the server. is this possible?
[23:41] <Slart> BillyZane: you need swap if you think you'll run out of memory or if you want to use hibernation.. one partition for the entire system will work nicely.. at least 30 GB or so would be my recommendation for a desktop
[23:41] <jrib> BillyZane: best way to learn is to just use it.  Browse the documentation at help.ubuntu.com.  /msg ubottu cli  if you want to learn the command line
[23:41] <WanderingEnder> Bizzeh, you want them to do what? The first part sounds like you want dumb terminals.
[23:41] <Egon> Bizzeh: remote users? or just remote domain controller_
[23:42] <WanderingEnder> Bizzeh, do you want something like how MS PCs have Single Sign On, they talk to a server for access credentials?
[23:42] <BillyZane> ok, so.. i'll go to help.ubuntu.com, and according to slart, i should install a 30 gig partition to install ubuntu
[23:42] <Bizzeh> WanderingEnder: i dont want the terminals to have anything installed on them, i would like to have a single install that i can modify, which will then reflect along all the other machines
[23:42] <WanderingEnder> BillyZane, have you used a LiveCD yet?
[23:42] <WanderingEnder> OK, so Bizzeh wants a Linux Thin Client deployment.
[23:43] <Bizzeh> there are over 70 computers, doing each pc one by one is more than i can be bothered with now
[23:43] <WanderingEnder> Tell Bizzeh what he's won, bot! (LTSP)
[23:43] <WanderingEnder> !LTSP | Bizzeh
[23:43] <ubottu> Bizzeh: LTSP is the Linux Terminal Server Project, which adds thin-client support to Linux servers. See chapter 3 of the !edubuntuhandbook, http://www.ltsp.org and/or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Terminal_Server_Project
[23:43] <Slart> BillyZane: asking in here is also a good way to learn.. most of the advice given is pretty reasonable =)
[23:44] <WanderingEnder> BillyZane, have you played with a live CD of Ubuntu yet?
[23:44] <Bizzeh> WanderingEnder: already looking on google for thin client ubuntu, seems official docs date back to 5.10 and i assume are massivly out of date, similar to the pxe docs that all require dhcpd3, which isnt a package now

[23:45] <magiK_> This is so awesome, I can use either Unity, GNOME GNOME(Classic), XFCE, Xubuntu(XFCE) wow this is pretty impressive.
[23:45] <CrestedNewt> I'm out - laters guys and girls
[23:45] <WanderingEnder> Bizzeh, extrapolate what you need (dhcpd) off 12.04 LTS and go from there.
[23:46] <WanderingEnder> You need a dhcp server on 12.04, dhcpd3 is no longer shipped, so you'll be configuring the new one that ships.
[23:47] <WanderingEnder> What you want to do is not a small project, Bizzeh, its one for a linux systems administrator who has experience and knowledge setting up servers.
[23:50] <Bizzeh> WanderingEnder: leaning by diving in at the deep end
[23:50] <abdostar> any idea how to buck up the whole system?
=== darkham is now known as krabador
[23:54] <Slart> abdostar: buck up as in "harden" or backup?
[23:54] <Ziber> Running apt-get dist-upgrade didn't even... upgrade.
[23:55] <Slart> Ziber: it just upgrades packages to the latest one from the repository it's configured to use
[23:55] <Slart> Ziber: it doesn't upgrade to a new version of the os.. like 11.10 to 12.04
[23:55] <Ziber> mysql is still at 5.1...
