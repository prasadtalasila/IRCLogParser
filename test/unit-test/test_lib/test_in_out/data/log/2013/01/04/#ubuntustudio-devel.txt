[00:15] <len-1304> zequence, I think we should add zita-ajbridge to our stuff. It seems to be a better method of using two cards than muti... synced or not.
[00:18] <len-1304> zita-rev1 looks good too, though the lib may already used in on of the LV2 plugins.
[12:42] <scott-work> good morning
[13:10] <zequence_> scott-work: Hi
[13:10] <zequence_> Just started working on the art
[13:10] <zequence_> Realized we had another Ubuntu Studio name logo on the fb page. Who's work is it?
[13:11] <scott-work> good. currently i am continuing to gather artwork and trying to find authors and licenses and rename stuff and find regular images along with .svg files
[13:11] <scott-work> i think ttoine had just updated the facebook page recently. looks much better than what we had
[13:12] <zequence_> scott-work: I was naughty and just updated it again https://www.facebook.com/Ubuntustudio
[13:12] <zequence_> I guess I could have done it on a staging page first
[13:13] <scott-work> i will have to look at it later. i left my laptop and tablet at home this morning :(
[13:14] <scott-work> although i do look forward to seeing it
[13:16] <zequence_> scott-work: http://imagepaste.nullnetwork.net/viewimage.php?id=5525
[13:18] <scott-work> full disclosure: that logo, where the 'n' and 't' run together, was my design....so i like this A LOT!
[13:18] <scott-work> ;)
[13:18] <scott-work> the more i think back, however, i think the CoF with a solid background was actually all cory's, i just put it into this (running n and t together) logo
[14:43] <zequence> ttoine: Hi. I updated the banner for fb. Based on discussions here in the channel
[14:45] <zequence> Now when I look at it in 1080p, it looks a bit uneven
[14:45] <zequence> Anyway, it's meant to serve as an example for how we do all the sites. Logo, name, slogan
[14:47] <ttoine> zequence, ok. for Google +, it is different, because the logo is on the right
[14:49] <ttoine> scott-work, the contact of Pleia2 is Benjamin, bkerensa@ubuntu.com
[14:52] <scott-work> ttoine: thank you 
[15:01] <ttoine> zequence, it would be great if this kind of artwork could be available on the website, a kind of official way, like xubuntu is doing
[15:06] <zequence> ttoine: Yes, we need to collect everything. I think I will start staging at my own page now, since I think we might want to reedit some stuff. I don't like how the text looks on the fb page in higher resolution
[15:06] <zequence> Looks a bit crappy
[15:07] <zequence> scott-work: I did my first kernel update today. Don't know if it succeeded, but I'm getting closer to taking over the maintenance
[15:07] <scott-work> ttoine: zequence i am collecting artwork now to put into the ubuntustudio-resources code in launchpad, i should have it pushed this weekend
[15:07] <zequence> scott-work: Great
[15:07] <scott-work> zequence: that is out-fing-standing!
[15:07] <scott-work> very exciting news
[15:07] <scott-work> re: artwork - i've been gathering the old release stuff, stuff that i've made, and user submissions as i can get them (wiki.ubuntu.com, deviantart)
[15:08] <zequence> I'm writing stuff down here, but this is only temporary. The procedure will change
[15:08] <zequence> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/KernelMaintenanc
[15:08] <scott-work> one thing that i am missing is a poster that says "Ubuntu STudio wants you!" and has a pictures of uncle sam (american concept). it bugs me to know that i have seen it but can't find it
[15:56] <scott-work> could anyone else try to help my friend martin own with some midi setup? https://plus.google.com/u/0/102241005050666075649/posts/L7N5AnJ8D8w
[16:00] <zequence> scott-work: Just posted, asking him to provide more info
[16:06] <scott-work> zequence: thank you very much
[16:12] <scott-work> zequence: i'm not sure he's doing anything currently to use the keyboard and he hasn't been exactly clear to his end goal
[16:16] <zequence> scott-work: Seems like what he needs is a script for starting all of those up, doing the connections, etc. There are a couple of ways to achieve it
[16:16] <scott-work> i'm sorry to jump into the conversation after i asked and graciously got involved
[16:17] <scott-work> errr. "after i asked and *you* graciously got involved"
[16:17] <scott-work> zequence: perhaps i'm wrong, but i'm not sure he has a process already worked out and defined
[16:17] <zequence> scott-work: np. He clarified and I interpret it as he mostly just wants to play the keyboard, not producing any music
[16:18] <zequence> Or, at least to have that part automated
[22:34] <ttoine> good night !
[22:34] <scott-work> going home myself
