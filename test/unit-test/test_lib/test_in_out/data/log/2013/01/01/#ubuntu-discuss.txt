[17:39] <Gnea> hi
[17:39] <gotwig> Can I in theory upgrade directly from 11.10 to 12.10?
[17:39] <Gnea> No.
[17:40] <Gnea> the only way would not be an upgrade, but a complete re-install.
[17:40] <Gnea> therefore, it would not be an upgrade.
[17:40] <Gnea> but it would get you straight to 12.10
[21:41] <MrChrisDruif> gotwig; but you can upgrade from 11.10 > 12.04 > 12.10...almost directly ;-)
[22:35] <gotwig> MrChrisDruif, -.-
[22:35] <MrChrisDruif> =)
