[00:11] <k1l_> !notunity | washuu_de
[00:11] <ubottu> washuu_de: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[00:14] <escott> !gnome3 | ukbeast
[00:14] <ubottu> ukbeast: GNOME 3 is the desktop environment on which Unity is based.  To use GNOME Shell instead of Unity, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool". GNOME 3 is not supported under Natty/11.04, and may break your system if installed from alternate sources.

[01:44] <dr_willis> i rarely mess with keybindings.. some are handled by gnome some are handled by compiz
[01:46] <memand> dr_willis: True that :) I'm wondering why no one is taking up the task of making a better composite manager than compiz (that can do equally awesome stuff)

[01:51] <helloworld> Hello World! I have ubuntu installed, but i would like to switch to linux mint. my computer does not have a disk drive. does anyone know how to do this?
[01:52] <craigbass1976> memand, fixed brightness too!
[01:52] <dr_willis> helloworld:  you mean you have no cdrom drive?
[01:52] <Hilikus> how can i check if a burnt iso is not corrupted?
[01:52] <jda2000> helloworld, does you computer have PXE boot capability.
[01:52] <memand> dr_willis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbrfy-HN4Gw
[01:52] <dr_willis> !md5 | Hilikus
[01:52] <ubottu> Hilikus: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[01:53] <helloworld> there is not optical drive, and i do not know what PXE boot capability is
[01:53] <jda2000> helloworld, Or should I say can it boot from the network adapter?
[01:53] <dr_willis> Hilikus:  check the md5 sum of the burnt cd
=== codezombie|away is now known as codezombie
[01:53] <helloworld> it can do that
[01:53] <dr_willis> helloworld:  use a bootable flash drive.. and i really suggest just sticking to Ubuntu
[01:53] <dr_willis> the cd also has some sort of verify option i thought
[01:53] <Hilikus> dr_willis: i saw that one, but it is to checksum the original iso and compare it to a number online, what i want is to checksum the created cd with all the files inside to see if it matches the content of the original iso
[01:54] <jda2000> helloworld, I guess I should have asked if you can boot from a flas drive first.
[01:54] <dr_willis> Hilikus:  if the checksum of the burnt cd  is the same as the iso. that sort of confirms its good.
[01:54] <memand> jda2000: :P
[01:54] <Hilikus> dr_willis: how do i checksum a cd? it will give one checksum for each file, whereas the iso is a single file
[01:55] <dr_willis> Hilikus:  i recall the live cds haveing some verify option that checked the files also.
[01:55] <dr_willis>  Hilikus  md5sum /dev/cdrom

[01:55] <helloworld_> sorry, my computer derped

=== LarrySteeze|Away is now known as LarrySteeze

[01:57] <helloworld_> ok.
=== leohxj is now known as legacy
[01:57] <helloworld_> i tried to install from a USB, but it did not work
[01:58] <dr_willis> then either you made the usb wrong, or dident tell the pc to boot the usb.. or it cant boot fromusb
[01:58] <Crazy_Spai> Q: Is there a way to reset your theme and all with Unity?
[01:58] <jda2000> helloworld_, USB flash or DVD?
[01:58] <Crazy_Spai> I have a weird issues where menu items have a white background but white text as well.
[01:58] <Crazy_Spai> It's quite buggy.
[01:58] <quinn_> I installed the proprietary AMD driver and now it has a watermark that says it's unsupported. I'm at a tty right now and I NEED THIS TO WORK VERY SOON. PLEASE HELP
[01:58] <dr_willis> Crazy_Spai:  all your settings are in .compiz and .config for the most part. You could rename those 2 dirs. and relog in
[01:58] <quinn_> I need to get back to the open source driver
[01:58] <Crazy_Spai> dr_willis: Thank you very much.
[01:58] <adamk> quinn_: So uninstall the proprietary driver.
[01:58] <helloworld_> when i booted from the usb, it said "non-system disk. press any key to reboot"
[01:58] <quinn_> How?
[01:59] <dr_willis> quinn_:  i belive theres a answer to that on askubuntu.com how to turnoff the watermark
[01:59] <memand> quinn_: What drivers did you install for what?
[01:59] <quinn_> flgrx or whatever for a Radeon 7290
[01:59] <adamk> quinn_: Presumably you used the Ubuntu driver installer (jockey) to install the drivers, right, since that's the supported method?  Just use the jockey to turn it off.
[01:59] <jda2000> helloworld_, so it didn't get far enough along to break you ubuntu system.....
[01:59] <quinn_> But if the GUI doesn't work...
[02:00] <adamk> You didn't say the GUI doesn't work...
[02:00] <dr_willis> http://askubuntu.com/search?q=amd+watermark
[02:00] <helloworld_> jda2000: what does that mean
[02:00] <quinn_> I said I was at a TTY, but I can't be pedantic right now
[02:00] <adamk> quinn_: So use 'apt-get remove fglrx*' to remove fglrx.
[02:00] <jda2000> helloworld_, you can still boot ubuntu?
[02:00] <adamk> quinn_: Maybe you can't, but I can.  What you said is not the same as "the GUI isn't working" :-)
[02:01] <julian-delphiki> there are other ways to get to a TTY than having the gui not work
[02:01] <julian-delphiki> so, adamk is correct
[02:01] <quinn_> Okay, it's removing
=== legacy is now known as leohxj
[02:01] <helloworld_> jda2000: if I remove the flash drive or change the boot priority, ubuntu loads normally
[02:02] <adamk> quinn_: As dr_willis said, you could also go through the steps to remove the watermark, but you will also need to check the Xorg log file to see why Xorg failed in the first place.
[02:02] <jda2000> helloworld_, OK, how much free space do you have on your hard drive?
[02:02] <quinn_> Restarting the computer..
[02:03] <helloworld_> jda2000: im not sure about the free space, but the whole thing is 160 gigs
[02:03] <n3tw0rk401> Xorg -configure
[02:03] <n3tw0rk401> that will create a new xorg file for you
[02:03] <jda2000> helloworld_, try df
[02:03] <helloworld_> hold on
[02:04] <helloworld_> jda200: it says 542664
[02:04] <quinn_> I had another question - brightness adjustment doesn't work on my machine. The FN keys show the little toggle menu, and the bar will move according to how I press buttons
[02:04] <quinn_> But the brightness of the screen itself does not change.
[02:05] <jda2000> helloworld_, have you backe everything up?
[02:05] <memand> quinn_: try doing 'cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness |& curl -F sprunge=@- sprunge.us' and send me the link that comes back :)
[02:05] <jda2000> helloworld_, have you backed everything up?
[02:05] <helloworld_> no, but there is nothing on m system i want to keep
[02:06] <quinn_> The first command comes up saying 0
[02:06] <n3tw0rk401> echo "7" > /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
[02:06] <jda2000> helloworld_, what did you put on the USB drive before you tried to boot it?
[02:06] <quinn_> The first command comes up saying 0
[02:06] <helloworld_> jda2000: like, ever?

[02:10] <memand> quinn_: try 'cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/max_brightness |& curl -F sprunge=@- sprunge.us'
[02:10] <helloworld_> jda2000: i used unetbootin to make a bootable usb with the iso i wanted, i plugged it in, changed the bios settings

[02:12] <dr_willis> helloworld_:  sounds like either the usb was made wrong. or its not seeing the usb first
[02:12] <jda2000> helloworld_, What kind of CPU do you have?
[02:12] <julian-delphiki> quinn_: what happened then you curl'd
[02:12] <memand> quinn_: Ok, then try 'sudo echo 10 > sudo /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness'
[02:13] <helloworld_> jda200: i have no idea
[02:13] <jda2000> helloworld_, This is just a shot in the dark but did you remove the USB from the drive before you re-booted?
[02:13] <helloworld_> jda2000: no
[02:14] <jda2000> helloworld_, This is just a shot in the dark but did you remove the USB from the socket.
=== leohxj is now known as legacy
[02:14] <helloworld_> jda2000: no
[02:15] <jda2000> helloworld_, at this point it looks like something went wrong with the preparation of the USB drive but I don't have a clue as to what.
[02:15] <cfhowlett> helloworld_, drives do go bad ...
[02:15] <memand> quinn_: Did anything happen when you did 'sudo echo 10 > sudo /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness' ?
[02:15] <dr_willis> helloworld_:  theres alterantive tools to make usb flash from isos at the pendrivelinux web site
[02:16] <Corey> memand: NO.
[02:16] <Corey> memand: You cannot redirect the output of sudo.
[02:16] <quinn_> let me check
[02:16] <helloworld_> jda2000: when i look at the files on the usb, there are some .exe files. does this mean the os i want can only be installed on windows?
[02:16] <Corey> !sudotee
[02:16] <jda2000> helloworld_, That
[02:16] <quinn_> Didn't work
[02:17] <jda2000> helloworld_, seems a bit odd.
[02:17] <memand> Corey: Then how would you recommend doing?
[02:17] <julian-delphiki> sudo sh -c "echo 10 > /sys/class/backlights/acpi_video0/brightness"
[02:17] <Corey> memand: printf "foo" | sudo tee /etc/file
[02:17] <Corey> I'm sure there's a factoid somewhere for that.
[02:17] <julian-delphiki> or this, memand:  sudo sh -c "echo 10 > /sys/class/backlights/acpi_video0/brightness"
[02:17] <quinn_> Nothing
[02:17] <julian-delphiki> should work
[02:18] <jtrucks> anyone worked with spideroak headless on multiple systems?
[02:18] <jda2000> helloworld_, You didn't see any error mesages as the USB drive was being set up?
[02:18] <quinn_> Was I supposed to put in the quotes too?
[02:18] <helloworld_> jda2000: in unetbootin?
[02:18] <jda2000> helloworld_, right.
[02:18] <memand> quinn_: Try the command that julian-delphiki wrote above you
[02:18] <helloworld_> jda2000: nope
[02:19] <quinn_> it puts a > before lines
[02:19] <jda2000> helloworld_, I like dr_willis's suggestion that there are other tools out there to make a bootable USB drive.
[02:19] <quinn_> Nothing else comes up..
[02:19] <helloworld_> jda2000: the ones i can find are all .exes
[02:19] <memand> quinn_: what do you mean it put's a > ?
[02:20] <Aufwind> Hi, I just updated my Ubuntu machine including some proprietary nvidia drivers and my Display which had usually a high Resolution (32 inches) is now "downgraded to" 1280x760. And this is the highest resolution I can select in settings. Any ideas what could have been broken? If you need more informaition to help me just let me know please. Don't know where to start. :-)
[02:20] <jda2000> helloworld_, Hmm...
[02:20] <dr_willis> pendrivelinux site has them for linux and windows.. and with newer disrtos you can just 'dd' the iso file straight to the usb
[02:20] <quinn_> If I hit return, it goes one line down and just has a > and then a flashing line
[02:21] <madprops> should i logout for update-alternative changes to take effect?
[02:21] <memand> quinn_: Ok, pres ctrl+c
[02:21] <julian-delphiki> quinn_: hit control-c, and then type sudo bash -c "echo 10 > /sys/class/backlights/acpi_video0/brightness"
[02:21] <helloworld_> dr_willis: i just do "dd isonamehere.iso"  ?
[02:21] <dr_willis> helloworld_:  you have to tell it where to go.
[02:21] <helloworld_> dr_willis: how
[02:21] <quinn_> same result
[02:21] <dr_willis> helloworld_:  and if you tell it the wrong device = erased hd
[02:22] <julian-delphiki> quinn_: and nothing is happening to your backlight?
[02:22] <dr_willis> helloworld_:  sudo dd if=theisofile.iso of=/dev/sdX                  where X = a,b,c,d  or whatever letter your usb is
[02:22] <quinn_> Nothing seems to be changing..
[02:22] <helloworld_> dr_willis: thank you, iwill try that
[02:22] <julian-delphiki> quinn_: try this command then
[02:22] <quinn_> The hardware keys act like I'm changing it, but the brightness isn't changing
[02:22] <dr_willis> quinn_:  it may be easier to be trying these echos from a root shell. that way the sudo redirection is not confuseing thingsd
[02:22] <jda2000> helloworld_, in fact, I see usb-creator-gtk on my Ubuntu system....
[02:23] <julian-delphiki> echo 10 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness
[02:23] <dr_willis> helloworld_:  get the wrong drive letter = erased hard drive..   so watch out
[02:23] <julian-delphiki> try that quinn_^
[02:23] <cfhowlett> jda2000, not sure it's not standard on ALL buntu's.  It's on my xubuntu as well

[02:35] <Seven_Six_Two> dr_willis, that's what I was thinking, but it's not getting worse, and not making noise. SMART says clean
[02:35] <quinn_> How do I do that?
[02:35] <dr_willis> Seven_Six_Two:  ive seen hds fail/die/come back to life... ;) work for a week.. then die again

[02:39] <elise0001> Thanks
[02:39] <julian-delphiki> elise0001: what caused this to start?
[02:40] <dr_willis> this may be caused by held packages  --> tried a 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'  ?
[02:40] <jda2000> I want to drag a bash script onto the launcher and have it stick there.  What keys should I hold down?
[02:40] <julian-delphiki> elise0001: and this is on a laptop?
[02:40] <jda2000> On 12.04
[02:40] <julian-delphiki> elise0001, yeah, try a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[02:40] <dr_willis> jda2000:  i dont think unity works that way. You may be able to make a .desktop file that launches the script and drag it...
[02:41] <elise0001> I think it happened over a week ago when the laptop had problems part way thru an upgrade. Monitor tiles strangely. Maybe have bad video drivers. Flakely computer. Power cord connection flakey.
[02:41] <jda2000> dr_willis, Ok THanks I'll google that.
[02:41] <elise0001> Got computer from silent auction.
[02:42] <julian-delphiki> elise0001, yeah, try a "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
[02:42] <jc___> I can't blacklist rt2800
[02:42] <elise0001> When monitor tiles, I have to unplug computer from power cord and take battery out and restart.
[02:43] <julian-delphiki> elise0001: okay, just please run the command
[02:43] <julian-delphiki> elise0001: don't really need /all/ of the backstory
[02:43] <econdudeawesome> howdy all
[02:43] <elise0001> ok
[02:44] <econdudeawesome> I am having a hard time figuring out how to get at old CRX database files in Ubuntu
[02:44] <econdudeawesome> specifically the metadata
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
[02:44] <elise0001> Will go try that now.
[02:44] <julian-delphiki> econdudeawesome: so.. chrome extensions
[02:45] <econdudeawesome> julian-delphiki: are you kidding? Sweet. Do you know of a specific one? (Working with FERC data, tiny little buggers not don't appear to be unicode)
[02:45] <julian-delphiki> econdudeawesome: i mean, aren't crx files chrome extensions?
[02:45] <fission6> i see my ssh port is opened when i scan my IP, but i don't understand what box it is? thatsmy ISP
[02:45] <econdudeawesome> julian-delphiki: no, not chrome extensions unfortunately. Old Visual Fox Pro database files
[02:46] <econdudeawesome> julian-delphiki: they may well share the extensions though
[02:46] <julian-delphiki> fission6: Do you have your port forwarded in your router?
[02:46] <Corey> econdudeawesome: I'd start digging through the apt repos to see if you can find something that'll get you the data you need.  Then script around it, iterate through.
[02:46] <fission6> i don't believe so
[02:47] <econdudeawesome> Corey: I would but I can't figure out the encoding at all
[02:47] <julian-delphiki> fission6: you have to forward it, if you're behind a router, or you won't be able to publically ssh to it.
[02:47] <fission6> i know
[02:47] <fission6> thats why i don't understand why port 22 is opened
[02:47] <fission6> when i scan my ip
[02:47] <Corey> econdudeawesome: Grab one of them, what does "file" say about it?
[02:47] <julian-delphiki> fission6: yep, it's open
[02:47] <fission6> yea
[02:48] <fission6> but why / how
[02:48] <julian-delphiki> fission6: and you're sure its not the SSH server?
[02:48] <econdudeawesome> Corey: Gotta be cross-listed. Maple Help Database. But the files were created by Visual Fox Pro in the late 90s
[02:48] <somsip> fission6: do you ahve a router/cable-modem?
[02:48] <Corey> econdudeawesome: Is this sensitive data, or can you share a file?
[02:49] <fission6> yes its paired together somsip
[02:49] <fission6> its one device
[02:49] <somsip> fission6: and you are scanning from an external source using you ISP allocated IP?
[02:49] <fission6> yep
[02:49] <econdudeawesome> Corey: I can share the file. Here is a link from the FERC site: http://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/forms/form-1/data.asp
[02:50] <somsip> fission6: so does your router have access to admin functions through SSH?
[02:50] <Corey> econdudeawesome: 82 MB compressed>
[02:50] <Corey> This might take some time. :-)
[02:50] <fission6> well i mean its one device
[02:51] <julian-delphiki> fission6: it's probably a port open for them to run diagnostics
[02:51] <econdudeawesome> Corey: yeah, sorry. The actual crx files are only like 8 kb or so...
[02:51] <julian-delphiki> fission6: however, it is a really old version of ssh...
[02:51] <econdudeawesome> they're metadata for the .dbf files (which open fine with a spreadsheet program)
[02:51] <Corey> econdudeawesome: Downloded.  Okay, let's see here.
[02:51] <fission6> julian-delphiki: i agree but still scary no?
[02:52] <julian-delphiki> fission6: you could always ask them why it's open
[02:52] <fission6> i just may
[02:52] <somsip> fission6: and you are scanning externaly, like from ShieldsUp or somewhere? Not scanning from your PC?
[02:52] <elise0001> Did not work.
[02:52] <elise0001> Will pastebin results
[02:52] <fission6> somsip yep, why do you ask
[02:52] <julian-delphiki> somsip: i just sucessfully connect to it, so yes, fission6 is talking externally
[02:53] <fission6> julian-delphiki: how did you connect just ssh?
[02:53] <somsip> fission6: because routesr can allow some ports from LAN but denies from WAN. So they appear open on an nmap scan by me, but not from elsewhere
[02:53] <julian-delphiki> fission6: yes
[02:53] <julian-delphiki> somsip: that's not the case here
[02:54] <fission6> i think its opened for the ISp
[02:54] <fission6> which is nuts
[02:54] <Corey> Hmm, none of my usual tools crack it open, econdudeawesome.
[02:54] <econdudeawesome> Corey: okay
[02:54] <vjacob> hiya. any ideas on how to proceed with an upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04, if "do-release-upgrade -d" only gives "No new release found" ?
[02:55] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: does it do anything without the -d?
[02:55] <vjacob> the /etc/lsb-release on the system contains "normal"
[02:56] <vjacob> sorry /etc/release-upgrades. meanwhile, /etc/lsb-release correctly reflects the installed system
[02:56] <vjacob> julian-delphiki, no
[02:56] <elise0001> julian-delphiki and others:   http://pastebin.com/QH4WVG8E
[02:57] <julian-delphiki> elise0001.... sudo apt-get dist-upgrade no spaces
[02:57] <julian-delphiki> between dist and upgrade
[02:58] <vjacob> julian-delphiki, if it makes any difference I think I started such an upgrade (and it worked) but interrupted it after 10 seconds
[02:58] <vjacob> in the past (had to make a backup first)
[02:58] <julian-delphiki> hmm....
[02:58] <vjacob> oh well
[02:59] <vjacob> I guess 11.10 will serve me fine, security updates seem to install and all
[02:59] <julian-delphiki> well, you could uninstall the package for upgrades and reinstall it
[02:59] <vjacob> oh
[02:59] <vjacob> good idea
[02:59] <vjacob> update-manager-core?
[02:59] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: apt-get remove --purge update-manager-core
[02:59] <julian-delphiki> yep
[03:00] <julian-delphiki> elise0001: why not just reinstall the OS on this?
[03:01] <blackangel> had anyone being lucky enought to get the ati 13 drivers works on ubuntu 12.10 yet?
[03:03] <vjacob> julian-delphiki, I didn't realise that purging ubuntu-desktop would make network-manager disfunctional
[03:03] <texla> I installed Ubuntu-12.04.1 to a 16 gb usb flash drive...When booting I  get the following message;;Out of range cannot display video mode change computer display input to 1600x1200 60mhz..How to fix
[03:04] <vjacob> julian-delphiki, hope that I can get the network back using wicd-curses, so I can reinstall ubuntu-desktop, update-manager-core, etc.
[03:04] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: oh, ouch, sorry about that
[03:04] <vjacob> not your fault
[03:05] <cfhowlett> !nomodeset|texla,
[03:05] <ubottu> texla,: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter

[03:06] <texla> cfhowlett, The message time out and then the o/s is fine...Monitor set at 1600x1200 4.3 and the o/s display the same
[03:09] <vjacob> julian-delphiki, if I can't find a way to get the network working again, which packages would you guess I should find a way to transfer manually or using a USB connected CDR?
[03:10] <vjacob> hopefully USB will work
[03:11] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: you should be able to mess with /etc/network/interfaces to make network work
[03:11] <asidjazz> anyone here konw vpnc well
[03:11] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: is this on wifi or wired?

[03:12] <vjacob> julian-delphiki, ethernet
[03:12] <php42> hello, how do i restore incremental backups that i've backed up to s3 using backup-manager ?
[03:12] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: then it should work easily.
[03:12] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: actually, if you do "sudo dhclient eth0" it may pick up an address that way
[03:13] <vjacob> julian-delphiki, actually it's already in there
[03:13] <julian-delphiki> and then you can reinstall ubuntu-desktop
[03:13] <cfhowlett> php42, I THINK it's sudo apt-get upgrade --reinstall

[03:15] <vjacob> I'm a bit hesitant to reboot presently, as you might imagine :)
[03:15] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: well... does "ifconfig" say that it has an IP?
[03:16] <vjacob> it doesn't (tried that). also "wicd-curses" never seems to finish 'obtaining IP address' (used to work, AFAIK)
[03:17] <vjacob> getting stranger...
[03:17] <julian-delphiki> vjacob, hmm, ifconfig eth0 down
[03:17] <julian-delphiki> vjacob: and then ifconfig eth0 up

[03:28] <marta> you can see the double "//"
[03:28] <bazhang> shortstraw8, did you actually write file.deb ? or the actual file name
[03:28] <marta> how can i clean it?
[03:28] <cfhowlett> marta, ez fix is to switch to a different mirror to test
[03:29] <marta> is the mirror the problem?
[03:29] <marta> i try another in a minute

[03:34] <raven_> ubuntu isnt very.. female friendly >_>
[03:34] <bazhang> asidjazz, ask the actual question
[03:34] <iml> marta: the url is obviously incorrect, but isn't this an apt-get problem? why apt-mirror?
[03:34] <usr13> raven_: WHy do you way that?
[03:34] <bazhang> raven_, thats nonsense
[03:34] <shortstraw8> bazhang, downloads
[03:34] <cfhowlett> raven_, ubuntu has no gender preferences
[03:34] <raven_> lol.. sorry im just having trouble
[03:34] <marta> i need a local mirro for my local net
[03:34] <thomedy> please please pleaes... i have been doing some work on a project for a client i went to make a bakc up just now before sending off my progress and i accidentally hit tar -xvzf instead of tar -cvzf is there anywhere i can recover the old version
[03:34] <thomedy> please
[03:34] <usr13> raven_: Is the drink holder not working?
[03:34] <bazhang> raven_, wrong channel for that

[03:35] <marta> i'd like to use this because i read is more useful but this bug make me really angry
[03:35] <asidjazz> bazhang: i got this remote box to connect to a vpn just fine.. but it drops my ssh connection and isnt connectable until i reboot it
[03:35] <raven_> cananyone help me install ati graphics drivers?
[03:35] <dr_willis> thomedy:  you extacted the old version on top of your new?
[03:35] <usr13> bazhang: Where is your sense of humor?
[03:35] <marta> apt-get works fine
[03:35] <thomedy> i didn't mean to but yes
[03:35] <asidjazz> bazhang: i basically need the command line option of that checkbox to "use the connections only for the resources on its network" equivalent
[03:35] <thomedy> i was trying to cvzf instead of x i just did it too fast
[03:35] <dr_willis> thomedy:  i know of no way to revover them
[03:35] <bazhang> usr13, this is NOT the jokes channel. /msg ubottu behelpful
[03:36] <iml> marta: I think you need to configure /etc/apt/mirror.list so it uses the working sources from sources.list

[03:48] <apsassin> hello, I am running Ubuntu 12.10 through an hdmi to my tv andd have no sound. In sound settings there is no option Hdmi option only digital or analogue. neither gives me any sound

[03:56] <julian-delphiki> well your sources.list is very wrong
[03:56] <julian-delphiki> it looks the same as your mirror.list
[03:56] <marta> whats wrong on my source.list?
[03:57] <Dionist> bazhang I think I had to rename the filename. It won't let me restart the conky itself so let me quickly log out and in. I'll get back to report.
[03:57] <julian-delphiki> marta: the entire ### CONFIG ### block... that isn't supposed to be there
[03:57] <julian-delphiki> marta: nor the clean lines.

[03:58] <cfhowlett> Rabblerouser, maybe.  details?

[04:00] <julian-delphiki> marta: your /etc/sources list should be all of 3 lines. http://pastebin.com/ai8eJwjd or similar
[04:00] <Rabblerouser> Not sure if Ubuntu sharing space with PC backups on my external would cause that
[04:00] <Dionist_> bazhang I'm back. And no, it wasn't the file name.

[04:01] <php42> hello, how do i restore incremental backups that i've backed up to s3 using backup-manager ?
[04:01] <marta> i follow that guide:  http://unixrob.blogspot.it/2012/05/create-apt-mirror-with-ubuntu-1204-lts.html
[04:01] <Dionist_> bazhang Nothing in the guide you gave me explains the invalid configuration errors. Although now I have a new error.
[04:02] <julian-delphiki> marta: well, you didn't, because that says nothing about modifying /etc/apt/sources.list
[04:02] <Dionist_>  Conky: invalid configuration file '/home/dion/.conkyrc'  Conky: missing text block in configuration; exiting ***** Imlib2 Developer Warning ***** : 	This program is calling the Imlib call:  	imlib_context_free();  	With the parameter:  	context  	being NULL. Please fix your program.
[04:02] <bazhang> Dionist_, well it was a custom config. so make your own that is not problematic
[04:03] <Dionist_> How about anyone else who can actually *help* rather than just "Here's a guide! ....oh. Then download something different or make your own."
[04:04] <julian-delphiki> Dionist_: no one here will probably be able to troubleshoot a custom conky config
[04:04] <b_> i just tried to `mv` a dir and it failed with the error msg, 'Directory not empty' what is this about?
[04:04] <OerHeks> Dionist_, how could we help, if we have not seen your conky script ? use paste.ubuntu.com for multiple lines
[04:05] <Dionist_> julian-delphiki Even if I link to said config package?

[04:05] <bazhang> Dionist_, the guide is how to understand making conky work, contact the custom config maker if you have issues. the guide itself is not a panacea for any and all custom configs out there
[04:06] <Rabblerouser> :/ Hm.. thanks anyways.
[04:06] <julian-delphiki> marta: are you using ARM?
[04:06] <marta> nono
[04:06] <marta> i386
[04:06] <marta> is only the same error found on google
[04:06] <julian-delphiki> then its unlikely that something being wrong with a regex that detects ARM will matter

[04:24] <dr_willis> there is no alt for 12.10

[04:25] <dr_willis> a PIII may not have that
[04:25] <cfhowlett> kewel, not USB?
[04:25] <jman> wait so...ungrubbing how

[04:39] <dr_willis> Nautilus:  df and du,
[04:39] <CrazyZurfer> Holy jesusss, by mistake I did a sudo chmod 644 / and everything is breaking and burniing!! :(
[04:39] <dr_willis> CrazyZurfer:  i predict a reinstall is in your future
[04:39] <CrazyZurfer> I mean 644 -R
[04:39] <CrazyZurfer> Dr_willis: no waaay
[04:40] <CrazyZurfer> There must be other way
[04:40] <julian-delphiki> no
[04:40] <julian-delphiki> a reinstall is probably the only fix there
[04:40] <dr_willis> use live cd. chroot, use package system to reinstall EVERY package.. and hope it works...
[04:40] <CrazyZurfer> Once i read that something could be done with the live cd
[04:41] <dr_willis> depending on how  quickly you stopped the chmod command...
[04:41] <CrazyZurfer> Kind of quickly
[04:41] <Nautilus> dr_willis: df seems to be the filesystems, du says "7248    ."     does that mean approx 7.4M ?
[04:41] <dr_willis> with a SSD ;) that may not be very quick.
[04:41] <dr_willis> Nautilus:  du -h  for human readable.. see man du
[04:42] <CrazyZurfer> I've got an 5400 rpm :)
[04:42] <bianca> every time i  install what it wants, it says im missing something else
[04:42] <dr_willis> i would imagine reinstalling every package on the system (not sure how you would do that) would take quiet some time.
[04:42] <Nautilus> dr_willis: thanks, ok that says 7.1M   But 12.04/LXDE says 7.4M filesize, 59.3M for size on disk. UI bug?
[04:42] <dr_willis> bianca:  we dont know what you are doing..  give details.
[04:43] <dr_willis> Nautilus:  no idea. I would guess so.
[04:43] <bianca> Supported adapter detected.
[04:43] <bianca> Check if system has the tools required for installation.
[04:43] <bianca> fglrx installation requires that the system have kernel headers.  /lib/modules/3.5.0-22-generic/build/include/linux/version.h cannot be found on this system.
[04:43] <bianca> One or more tools required for installation cannot be found on the system. Install the required tools before installing the fglrx driver.
[04:43] <bianca> Optionally, run the installer with --force option to install without the tools.
[04:43] <FloodBot1> bianca: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[04:43] <bianca> Forcing install will disable AMD hardware acceleration and may make your system unstable. Not recommended.
[04:43] <CrazyZurfer> I stopped it in 10 secconds approx
[04:43] <Nautilus> dr_willis: ok thanks for the sanity check. du is probably the reliable one
[04:43] <bianca> accident! i ment to put a link http://pastebin.com/gDRw9Ddf
[04:43] <julian-delphiki> CrazyZurfer: i recommend backing up your home folder and reinstalling
[04:43] <dr_willis> Nautilus:  unless its some sort of sparse file.
[04:43] <Nautilus> dr_willis: an SQL dump (text file)
[04:44] <CrazyZurfer> Ok, i guess I'm reinstalling
[04:45] <dr_willis> theres no need to msg me bianca  i dont use ati drivers.. so have very little experence with them
[04:45] <dr_willis> the one ati ssytem i have - uses the open sourced drivers
[04:45] <bianca> do you know how i fix that error?
[04:45] <GeminiDomino> Any gotchas for mounting /var "noexec" on xorg-less Lucid or Precise servers?
[04:46] <dr_willis> fglrx installation requires that the system have kernel headers.
[04:46] <dr_willis> !headers
[04:46] <ubottu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages
[04:46] <dr_willis> sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)    to install headers..
[04:46] <marta> thanks a lot julian-delphiki
[04:48] <bianca> it says i dont need it

[04:54] <noobatlife> Ok
=== daniel is now known as Guest48317
[04:55] <noobatlife> Is it possible to install microsoft office 2010 using Vmware on linux ubuntu?
[04:55] <noobatlife> Is there a way i  can get a small minimalist version of windows to use?
[04:55] <noobatlife> I wouldnt go to these lengths just for Access
=== raven_ is now known as bianca
[04:55] <noobatlife> Its because of my school
[04:55] <noobatlife> They rely on windows products too much
[04:56] <noobatlife> I live in a country that doesnt even know that linux exist
[04:56] <dr_willis> noobatlife:  you install the OS into the virtual machine. such as Vbox or vware. then install the app on the Virtual OS in the vm.
[04:56] <dr_willis> noobatlife:  so it should work
[04:56] <noobatlife> Exacly dr willis
[04:56] <noobatlife> But i need a minimalist version of windows
[04:56] <dr_willis> noobatlife:  so Yes its possible. -
[04:56] <noobatlife> the pain of downloading a whole OS
[04:56] <bianca> dr willis, i have an 8core cpu, do i ineed to install something so ubuntu uses it properly?
[04:56] <dr_willis> Thats not really a ubuntu support issue. ;)
[04:57] <noobatlife> internet speed is slow
[04:57] <noobatlife> Yes it is
[04:57] <dr_willis> bianca:  Not that i would know of.. ubuntu has been multi core friendly for years
[04:57] <noobatlife> OK
[04:57] <noobatlife> I will do some google searching around
[04:57] <bianca> :2 okie
[04:57] <noobatlife> If i cant get anything I will call it a day
[04:57] <noobatlife> makes no sense killing out myself
[04:58] <dr_willis> some speciffic apps may not use all cores. but  it depends on the exact ap
[04:58] <bianca> its the amd 8core not the i7 4 core with hyperthreading
[04:58] <dr_willis> I doubt if it matters much. ive not herd of anything special needed for the current generation cpus.
[04:59] <ShapeShifter499> hi
[04:59] <dr_willis> test it with a live cd and see if it works. ;)
[04:59] <bianca> i dunno.. i spent alot of money on my pc and i feel as if its being waisted in linux..
[04:59] <bianca> like i went and got the bestamd motherboard and cpu and fast ram
[04:59] <dr_willis> If you bought a system for Linux and specifically got an ATI card.. you should have done some more research
[05:00] <dr_willis> 'cutting edge/just came out hardware' is the most problematic  to deal with.
[05:00] <cfhowlett> ShapeShifter499, greetings
[05:00] <bianca> no.. lol i have an nvidia laptop and ubuntu wonteven install on it cause of the graphics card
[05:00] <dr_willis> stuff that has been out for a few months to a year. are often no hassles.
[05:00] <dr_willis> I have no issues with my 4 nvidia systems.
[05:00] <dr_willis> The nvidia-optimus stuff is a problem area however. I dont own one of those
[05:01] <bianca> ohh mine is, its a 555m
[05:01] <dr_willis> #'s like that dont mean much to me. I dont keep up with latest hardware any more :)
[05:01] <dr_willis> not much point in it when im doing linux on most all my machines
[05:01] <dr_willis> i look for 'best value for the $$ and best linux compatiabilty' when buying new hardware
[05:02] <bianca> well i guess i can virtualise windows as a 4core with 8 gigs of ram >_<
[05:02] <bianca> thats only half my system so
[05:02] <dr_willis> I rarely even need to boot to windows these days.
[05:02] <bianca> i play games :3
[05:02] <dr_willis> when i do.. its like a backlog of 5+mo of updates.
[05:02] <Nautilus> in 12.04, where would I likely find the default php.ini ?
[05:03] <dr_willis> Nautilus:  try 'locate php.ini'
[05:03] <dr_willis> I imagine my Next PC will be one of those Valve Steam Pistons. ;) if they ever come out.
[05:05] <ShapeShifter499> so I recently turned my netbook into a wifi router because my current one is old, had a broken antenna, and data seemed slow.  Everything is great but for the life of me I cannot figure out how to open ports, my setup looks pretty much like the stuff I got from this guide with the exception of static ip for 2 computers in dhcpd.conf http://nims11.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/hostapd-the-linux-way-to-create-virtual-wifi-access-
[05:05] <ShapeShifter499> point/
[05:05] <ShapeShifter499> my netbook runs 12.04
[05:05] <noobatlife_> Which virtualization software is better? Virtual Box or Vmware?
[05:05] <ShapeShifter499> yes I have tried iptables with no seeming luck
[05:05] <bianca> how do you turn a netbook into a router? lol
[05:06] <ShapeShifter499> bianca, http://nims11.wordpress.com/2012/04/27/hostapd-the-linux-way-to-create-virtual-wifi-access-point/
[05:06] <Nautilus> dr_willis: I don't seem to have a default one, would that be normal? I have 17 in backups of live sites, one in docs named php.ini-development, then in usr/share/php5 there are php.ini-production, -production-dist, -production.cli
[05:07] <user02938> I used ubuntu 12.04 mini .iso (non-pae net installer) to install "ubuntu lxde desktop". Problem is my d-link dwa-125 wireless USB doesn't work with lxde but it works fine with kubuntu desktop. Why?
[05:07] <noobatlife_> Which virtualization software is better? Virtual Box or Vmware?
[05:07] <Buddy> Howdy everyone
[05:08] <Buddy> is there a better channel for those of us who are totally and completely new to Ubuntu and Linux in general? lol
[05:08] <upset> used WinUSB to try and write a live Windows usb, didn't work and want to clear it for something else but it's acting weird. umount doesn't think it's mounted.
[05:08] <Nautilus> noobatlife_: put it this way, those are the best 2. Give one a go
[05:09] <upset> sudo mkfs.vfat -n 'Label' -I /dev/sdc thinks that it's busy
[05:09] <noobatlife_> Nautilus loves crashing for no reason as well
[05:09] <user02938> Buddy, well this is a help room for ubuntu/linux
[05:10] <Nautilus> don't look at me, I'm just the friendly neighboorhood cephalopod
[05:10] <Nautilus> noobatlife_: ^
[05:10] <Buddy> thanks User... just figured you might be more into helping people with specific issues who have a vague idea of how to get around Linux
[05:10] <Buddy> I am brand new to it just starting to explore and know absolutely NOTHING! lol
[05:11] <Rich787> How do you pass arguments to a ./configure script? I tried the following: ./configure --with-apr <directory> and it says "invalid value of canonical build"
[05:12] <cfhowlett> Buddy, use the forums ... beginner section
[05:13] <Nautilus> would usr/share/php5/ be an appropriate place to put a default php.ini file?
[05:13] <Buddy> thanks cfhowlett
[05:13] <Nautilus> Buddy: first guess, it may not be mounted
[05:13] <cfhowlett> Buddy, no problem.  have fun, be safe.
[05:13] <Seven_Six_Two> woot! VT8237 and SATAIII is best described by a series of 4 letter words.
[05:14] <Buddy> oh thanks Nautilus... I actually am having no problems. Up and running well just figured IRC would be a great way to dive into a little trial and error and explore the system...
[05:14] <Buddy> where I can get a little interaction and feedback. ; ) thanks for offering such a quick help idea though
[05:15] <Seven_Six_Two> I jumpered my 6Gb/s drive to 3Gb/s. Aside from flat out not working, is there a reason not to undo it after install?
[05:15] <Nautilus> Buddy: this is a good place. hang around, be patient, etc
[05:16] <Seven_Six_Two> I have 2 sata controllers. the first is via, and it won't work with my drive. I jumpered while connected to that controller. Then I switched to another controller, and it works, but is still jumpered.
[05:16] <Buddy> lol thanks much Nautilus. Just saw 1622 total users in channel and figured this might not be the one to be flooding with total newbie kind of stuff lol
[05:16] <Nautilus> Buddy: it's the general chat channel
[05:17] <Seven_Six_Two> Buddy, it's not busy in here now, so don't be shy.
[05:17] <Rabblerouser> Am I correct in assuming you can only install 4GB of Linux onto an external USB?
[05:17] <upset> Again, weird flash drive. Says it isn't mounted even though I can look at file contents, when I go to format it it says it's busy. I need to clear it outl
[05:17] <Buddy> lol thanks Seven : )
[05:17] <Seven_Six_Two> Rabblerouser, what do you mean by "4GB of Linux"
[05:18] <Rabblerouser> The pendrive installer. Says I can only go up to ~4000MB
[05:18] <Seven_Six_Two> Rabblerouser, you can have partitions larger than that, and you can use usb drives that are whole, or partitioned.
[05:18] <cfhowlett> Rabblerouser, since the USB is going to boot into ram, I believe you'd be more concerned with that ...
[05:18] <yoga> Hi, there. How do I install grub 2 boot loader onto a partition(/dev/sda3)?
[05:18] <Nautilus> upset: huh, have you tried a reboot?
[05:18] <Seven_Six_Two> Rabblerouser, 32 bit?

[05:19] <Rabblerouser> I realized something was wrong when I loaded up Steam on Linux and saw I only had ~300MB space left
[05:19] <Seven_Six_Two> Rabblerouser, how large is your usb drive/partitions?
[05:19] <Seven_Six_Two> Rabblerouser, is that the partitioner that's giving that limit?
[05:20] <Rabblerouser> Seven_Six_Two: 500GB total. But the Ubuntu partition is 395GB
[05:20] <Rabblerouser> The other partition is my PS3's backup :)
[05:21] <yoga> sudo grub-install /dev/sda3 will not do it, it won't allow to do that.
[05:21] <elise0001>  Donloaded newest stable version of Ubuntu. Having trouble burning it to a CD. Any advice. On my Ubuntu system, which has problems.
[05:21] <Seven_Six_Two> Rabblerouser, where did the pendrive installer come from?
[05:22] <cfhowlett> elise0001, did you md5sum check the iso?
[05:22] <cfhowlett> elise0001, and no USB boot?
[05:22] <Rabblerouser> It's the one linked from the Ubuntu page. pendrivelinux.com, apparently
[05:23] <Seven_Six_Two> elise0001, what kind of problems? Have you tried both k3b and brasero?
[05:23] <yoga> the command grub-setup is not found, any idea?
[05:23] <cfhowlett> yoga, just reinstall grub to the target drive ... should be /dev/sda

[05:32] <vhadil> so how to fix my problem
[05:32] <Buddy> howlett : )
[05:32] <cfhowlett> vhadil, time to upgrade to a supported version.  I suggest 12.04
[05:33] <tacorwin> Is it a bad idea to use Ubuntu 12.04 Live from a USB on a daily basis?
[05:33] <yoga> cfhowlett: without reinstall the whole Ubuntu again? Just the grub2, how?
[05:34] <Rabblerouser> What is the "persistent file" on a Live USB install?
[05:34] <cfhowlett> tacorwin, BAD idea?  no.  just be careful when shutting down the usb or it will scramble.
[05:34] <fafaliel> Can't anybody answer my python package question??
[05:34] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  thats a place it saves changes and user data files to
[05:34] <cfhowlett> yoga, I think it's sudo grub-install and the grub update to write the changes.
[05:34] <cfhowlett> fafaliel,  ask in #python
[05:34] <cfhowlett> fafaliel, oh, wait. sorry.  wrong response.
[05:34] <Rabblerouser> dr_willis So basically that's my "free space" on a Live USB install? And I can have, at max, 4 GB?
[05:35] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  depens on the size of your usb
[05:35] <Rabblerouser> My USB has room for plenty. :) Though I only wanted to try 160GB
[05:35] <Rabblerouser> It's an external HDD
[05:35] <vhadil> damn, reinstal
[05:35] <yoga> cfhowlett: grub-install will not allow me to install to a partical partition, that is sudo grub-install /dev/sda3 will fail!
[05:35] <tacorwin> cfhowlett: What do you mean?
[05:36] <kmon> Sorry, try again. [sudo] password for
[05:36] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  using a live install on a external HD is a little  limiting. You can do a full normal install to a external USB Hd.
[05:36] <kmon> pls help " Sorry, try again. [sudo] password for"
[05:36] <cfhowlett> vhadil, that package doesn't show up in the repos and I've got ALL universes enabled.  I'm guessing you built from source?
[05:36] <Rabblerouser> dr_willis: and how would I do that?
[05:36] <dr_willis> kmon:  we dont really know what you are asking.
[05:36] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  same as you install to a internal HD. Just be sure grub goes to the external HD

[05:37] <BlackWeb> I've been running into this problem ever since I installed 12.04, with the Login Screen Wallpaper, I installed a Package with Edubuntu, & ever since the login screen has been a Picture of a Satellite & a guy in the ground, I've tried Changing permissions in /usr/share/backgrounds/ No worky, I tried Erasing all the edubuntu wallpapers inside folder and login screen is just blue background, But when I go into Ubuntu tweak its showing
[05:37] <BlackWeb>  the one I selected as the one set but its not using it, Does Edubuntu Package overwrite Ubunut tweak or where is the setting for this?
[05:38] <Rabblerouser> The thing is, I'm just trying Ubuntu out. I don't really know how to even start the process of this
[05:38] <BlackWeb> Almost about to reinstall the whole system but seems like overkill for a wallpaper
[05:38] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:    i normally install from a live-usb-flash to a real external USB HD..
[05:38] <cfhowlett> BlackWeb, /ubuntu tweak/  you're managing your ubuntu system with a NON-repo and non-ubuntu product.  Expect unforeseen consequences.

[05:39] <wing_> hi
[05:39] <cfhowlett> wing_, greetings
[05:39] <dr_willis> BlackWeb:  could be its not using lightdm also.
[05:39] <Rabblerouser> dr_willis: Ubuntu will give me the option to select which drive to install to?
[05:39] <fafaliel> apt package for wxPython => AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'VERSION_STRING' ?
[05:39] <wing_> thanks, could someone please help me fix internet?
[05:39] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  yes. theres a custome install section
[05:39] <dr_willis> wing_:  thats a little vague.. give more details
[05:40] <wing_> i think my DNS not working
[05:40] <BlackWeb> Alright I'll try, reinstalling & leave out the edubuntu package
[05:40] <cfhowlett> fafaliel, ask in #python as well.  That package isn't part of ubuntu ...
[05:40] <BlackWeb> Thanks for Help everyone
[05:40] <cfhowlett> wing_, why?
[05:40] <wing_> i did upgrade to quantal and now it connects to wireless but doesn't work in browser
[05:40] <dr_willis> wing_:  but IRC works?
[05:40] <wing_> this is different computer
[05:40] <Rabblerouser> Hm.. I'll see if I can get the process started now. Thanks. I'll hit you up if it don't work.
[05:41] <cfhowlett> wing_, wired uses DNS to search internet names ....
[05:41] <wing_> yeah I'm not sure that's where the problem is
[05:41] <cfhowlett> BlackWeb, try sudo apt-get purge edubuntu
[05:41] <cfhowlett> wing_,  if your wired can see the internet, it's NOT  a DNS issue.
[05:41] <wing_> it's a little strange since it connects fine to the router but can't seem to get to the internet
[05:41] <tacorwin> Is it a bad idea to use Ubuntu 12.04 Live from a USB on a daily basis? (I already asked, but didnt get a clear responce
[05:42] <wing_> it's wireless
[05:42] <yoga> So my question would be: How do I reinstall grub on a partition instead of on the drive, while grub-install /dev/sda3 failed?
[05:42] <cfhowlett> tacorwin if you need daily ubuntu, you can install virtualbox in win and put ubuntu on that ... safely
[05:42] <wing_> i really don't know where to start for something like this cfhowlett so I came here
[05:42] <cfhowlett> wing_, understood.
[05:43] <user02938> tarcorwin, from past experience, ubuntu on usb runs horribly slow and updates can fail.  Might depend on the quality and speed of your usb
[05:43] <dr_willis> yoga:  what was the exact command you used?
[05:43] <cfhowlett> wing_, does your wifi indicator light up?  and what is your hardware?
[05:43] <tacorwin> cfhowlett: My main issue is that i have a portable computer, but i cant install it because the flash memory is all corrupted from extended use.
[05:44] <wing_> yeah it connects fine, it's a vaio, the light is on, everything seems cool until I open browser and it acts like it's not connected
[05:44] <cfhowlett> tacorwin, ummm, we cannot work around hardware failures with software.
[05:44] <cfhowlett> tacorwin, so I guess USB is the way to go
[05:45] <dr_willis> wing_:  start with a ping test. to see if you can ping the local pcs and google.com and the router.
[05:45] <bianca> now that humans have left chernoble, animals have moved in and calling it home >_< :( kinda sad that its hurting them though
[05:45] <dr_willis> wing_:  ping google.com   in a tutorial.
[05:45] <tacorwin> will i be able to run sudo apt-get update?
[05:45] <cfhowlett> tacorwin, I wouldn't.
[05:45] <dr_willis> in a terminal. ;)
[05:46] <julian-delphiki> bianca: this is a support channel..
[05:46] <wing_> i tried that it says unknown host
[05:46] <bianca> im supporting!
[05:46] <dr_willis> wing_:  now try 'ping 8.8.8.8'
[05:46] <wing_> i can ping my router though
[05:46] <tacorwin> cfhowlett: okay, just checking.
[05:46] <julian-delphiki> bianca: not by talking about chernobyl
[05:47] <cfhowlett> tacorwin, the biggest problems I've hard are updates and accidentally yanking the USB before uubntu shuts down.  The latter will scramble your system.
[05:47] <bianca> im educating
[05:47] <wing_> ok ping 8.8.8.8 works fine also
[05:47] <julian-delphiki> bianca, no
[05:47] <dr_willis> wing_:  so these tests point to you not having a proper DNS server setup.

[05:47] <thomedy> quick question... i have been doing very well... as of late... however i m still fairly new at this i have an overflow of work and handing it off to people ... i have  a list of contacts that im pretty confident in to take my over flow ... here is my question... im now taking on the roll of project management as well as developper which is awesome i have a contract i have to bid on but before i can bid on it i need some psd's is it reaso
[05:47] <thomedy> nable to ask my overflow people to give me a mockup to send my potential client ... my goal is to ask 3 or so of my overflows for mockups and get their quote on time and price and then send it to my client and then choose...
[05:47] <julian-delphiki> bianca: you even spelled chernobyl wrong.
[05:47] <thomedy> okay thats it is that reasonable
[05:47] <yoga> dr_willis: sudo grub-install /dev/sda3
[05:47] <dr_willis> wing_:  8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 are googles free DNS servers. You can use the network config tools to set them as your default dns servers
[05:47] <bianca> at least i made an effort :3
[05:47] <wing_> yeah, I don't see anywhere to change dns settings

[08:09] <varikonniemi> david_, merger?
[08:09] <varikonniemi> where from is this info
[08:09] <varikonniemi> i thought it had to do with google taking over flash development on linux through chromium, and adobe just freeing resources
[08:10] <apm1> ActionParsnip, do i have to edit these preferences everytime or ufw retains them even after a reboot ?
[08:10] <vhadil> i want to build ubuntu server, stable version for server version what 12.
[08:11] <somsip> vhadil: if it's for production, 12.04 is probably best as you have long term support on it
[08:11] <david_> I tried to watch a facew book video and it said that I needed a plugin.  When I clicked to get it, it said 11.2 was the final release.  I read elsewhere of a partnership of Microsoft with Adobe and a possible merger.

[08:14] <Ascavasaion> ActionParsnip: Well, chrome is installed... now to se if Flash works.
[08:14] <somsip> chamunks: make sure /wordpress/.htaccess can be written/created by www-data.
[08:14] <apm1> ActionParsnip, sorry to ask a stupid question ,but does ufw retain the preferences i edited with gufw even after a reboot ?
[08:14] <mikubuntu> ActionParsnip: just now i had to log out and back in to webchat.freenode.net because when i tried to post the page said that action would close all irc windows -- that never happend before, could it be related to the /tmp thing?

[08:17] <chamunks> somsip, not when i enable them just when I navigate once I have done so.  plus in w3tc plugin it tells me the .htaccess file isnt allowing rewrites or nginx is interfearing but i dont have nginx installed so its likely the htaccess

[08:19] <chamunks> somsip, well according to the diagnostics from the w3tc it is.
[08:20] <somsip> chamunks: ugly fix is to chmod 777, write it, then chmod it back to something safe. But it's something around permissions

[08:30] <chamunks> I do not
[08:30] <chamunks> somsip, so after I'm finished I should set it back to none?
[08:31] <ActionParsnip> Ascavasaion: you may need an older flash, or you could try gnash, lightspark or even minitube , no need for flash then :)

[08:51] <technikfreak> dr_willis : but a 16 year teenager will hve a own laptop
[08:51] <ActionParsnip> Technikfreak: could install squid or snort and use that as a proxy, could use a dedicated box then pull up monthly logs etc
[08:51] <dr_willis> Given the size of 'protecting' the network. You have to really defin what you want to let them do and not do.. theres not going to be a single perfect answer

[08:55] <Guest87162> Guys, I'm on a USB trying out Ubunto. If I try to install OpenVpn by doing  sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn I get the error: "Package network-manager-openvpn is not available, but is referred to by another package.
[08:55] <Guest87162> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
[08:55] <Guest87162> is only available from another source" Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?
[08:56] <qualia> ubunto :P

[09:00] <Guest87162> @Action, I did try this command from that page: sudo apt-get install network-manager-openvpn
[09:00] <dr_willis> Guest87162:  start with a 'sudo apt-get update' then try reinstalling it

But still, sudo-apt-get install network-manager-openvpn gives me the same error of there being no release candidates. Could it be because I'm on a USB and haven't installed Ubuntu yet?

[09:50] <ikonia> Eagleman: you've not given en iput
[09:50] <ikonia> an
[09:51] <Eagleman> I noticed, i think its working now. Have to find a way to decrypt now
[09:52] <ikonia> Eagleman: ???? why are you doing this if you don't know how to decrypt it
[09:52] <dr_willis> CQ:  you are using ssh x forwarding?
[09:52] <ikonia> encypting something when you don't know how to decrypt it......very silly
[09:52] <Eagleman> To protect my backup.tar.gz file
[09:52] <ikonia> Eagleman: yes, but you don't know how to decrypt it
[09:52] <Eagleman> ikonia, its just for testing purposes now
[09:52] <ikonia> so it's worthless
[09:53] <Eagleman> for now it is
[09:53] <justmeh> ikonia, wrong
[09:53] <justmeh> its not silly, its smart
[09:53] <dns53> Eagleman have you tried using gpg?
[09:53] <justmeh> as long as all keystrokes were recorded and output, there's no issue.
[09:53] <Eagleman> dns53, will do it after this
[09:54] <ikonia> justmeh: what ?
[09:54] <ikonia> justmeh: encypting a file so you can't use it....is "good"
[09:54] <ikonia> sorry, but no
[09:54] <justmeh> [01:52] <ikonia> encypting something when you don't know how to decrypt it......very silly <- wrong
[09:54] <ikonia> no, it's not
[09:54] <ikonia> as it makes the file worthless
[09:54] <justmeh> you just don't have your head wrapped around an experimentation round
[09:54] <ikonia> you've just created a worthless file
[09:54] <justmeh> wrong
[09:54] <justmeh> the keystrokes and issues observed all will teach how to actually use it
[09:55] <justmeh> its as if you saying don't bother unless you already know how
[09:55] <justmeh> not very useful for a learning channel
[09:55] <ikonia> so lets see, you have a file you can use.....you encypt it with a technicque you have no idea how to decypt it and thus making the file usless
[09:55] <ikonia> you need an idea of how to decyrpt it before encypting it so you get the encyption options right
[09:55] <Eagleman> ikonia, let me find out how to decrypt it...
[09:56] <CQ> dr_willis: yes, trying ssh -X remotehost but its not settingthe display at the remote end
[09:56] <ThinkT510> ikonia: i think what justmeh is trying to say is that it is good that Eagleman is trying to learn about encrption/decryption
[09:56] <justmeh> yes
[09:56] <justmeh> and as long as the keystrokes are recorded even a failed attempt is useful.
[09:56] <justmeh> anything useful is not silly.
[09:56] <dr_willis> CQ:  you  sure you dont me -x  ? i recall -X and -x being opposites.. one disables X fowarding
[09:56] <justmeh> thus my disagreement ;)
[09:57] <ikonia> ThinkT510 I'm not saying learning is bad, but randomly doing things that can potentially ruin your files...unwise
[09:57] <dns53> gpg is relatively straight forward, gpg --encrypt --recipient 'email@host' filename,   just export the public key to the user running the script and you do not need a password to encrypt
[09:57] <CQ> dr_willis: -X enables, -x disables according to the manpage
[09:57] <ikonia> research before typing commands seems a more mature approach to achieving the goal
[09:58] <dr_willis> CQ:  jusat checking.. seen people get them reversed.. i always just setit to alwaysforward.
[09:59] <dr_willis> CQ:   if X forwarding. you shouldent need tobe messing with the xhost command at all. that would let you run an app and have  it appear on the remote pc.
[10:00] <CQ> dr_willis: any ideas why it wouldn't be set?
[10:00] <dr_willis> CQ:   if X forwarding. you shouldent need tobe messing with the xhost command at all. that would let you run an app and have  it appear on the remote pc.
[10:01] <justmeh> Eagleman, i think you forgot the input file?
[10:01] <CQ> dr_willis: all I'm doing right now is ssh -X remotehost /usr/bin/xeyes and its not getting a display... if I just ssh -X remotehost and echo $DISPLAY its empty
[10:01] <justmeh> http://www.madboa.com/geek/openssl/#encrypt-simple <- random related content @ Eagleman
[10:02] <dr_willis> echo $DISPLAY
[10:02] <dr_willis> localhost:10.0
[10:02] <dr_willis> is what i get when im ssh'd and x forwarding
[10:02] <CQ> locally I jsut see :0 which is OK...
[10:02] <justmeh> @ Eagleman also: http://www.fir3net.com/Redhat-/-Fedora/password-protect-and-encryptsalt-a-file-with-openssl-in-linux.html
[10:02] <justmeh> you should be set after looking through those
[10:02] <dr_willis> this is locally
[10:03] <CQ> what do you see if you ssh -X remotehost and there echo $DISPLAY?
[10:03] <dr_willis>  ssh -X localhost
[10:03] <dr_willis> ;)
[10:03] <dr_willis> was my test.. Idont have a box to ssh to at the moment
[10:03] <CQ> no, ssh -X remotehost... thats where you want to run the application.
[10:03] <CQ> ah, ok

[10:59] <headcr4sh> changing the hw clock works... BUT syncing hw clock to system clock doesn't. -- that is really strange
[11:00] <headcr4sh> 'hwclock --set --date="tomorrow" && hwclock -s' << I can see (just execute `hwclock`), that my hardware clock was changed. But it fails to adjust the system clock.
[11:00] <justmeh> well
[11:00] <justmeh> first set hwclock to utc
[11:00] <justmeh> then set system tzdata to local zone
[11:00] <headcr4sh> Something must be running in the background, but I can't put my finger on anything suspicious.
[11:00] <justmeh> then still issues?

[11:01] <erupter> hi guys! is there a well known reason why when in tty console (alt+fn) the alignement of the last row oscillates between the bottom and the top of the screen? as if some vertical alignement was wrong, except we don't have cathode ray tubes anymore :P

[11:02] <justmeh> erupter, once was good, sounds like you have a vid driver issue
[11:02] <erupter> justmeh, sorry, could not read the first part of the question the first time I posted (blank spaces). that's unfortunate about the vid drivers...
[11:02] <headcr4sh> justmeh: I'll try to figure out WHAT to pastebin. ;) -- btw. the time precission HOWTO is not applicable for Ubuntu 12.10 either -- e.g. no /etc/sysconfig/clock file on 12.10 anymore.
[11:03] <headcr4sh> justmeh: something must really have changed. In the past it was enough to stop "ntp" and set date/time manually via "date" command...
[11:04] <justmeh> headcr4sh, what i do:

[11:08] <megha> is that true that after installing once we have to install it again and again when a new version of ubuntu is available ?
[11:08] <Ben64> you can upgrade
[11:08] <justmeh> megha, upgrades are pretty easy
[11:08] <justmeh> in fact it will tell you when one is out by default IIRC
[11:09] <Sling> yes, in the motd
[11:09] <justmeh> Sling, think desktop
[11:09] <justmeh> motd can do that also -- but that's typically server
[11:09] <Sling> sorry, I'm more of a server guy :)
[11:09] <justmeh> you can force a check, lets see, something like 'update-manager -d' or so
[11:09] <Sling> but anyway, best way is probably to subscribe to the announce list
[11:09] <justmeh> Sling, i hear ya ;)
[11:09] <justmeh> ya
[11:10] <justmeh> when ur system checks for packages it should be checking for releases
[11:10] <justmeh> daily / weekly / whatever its set to
[11:10] <megha> so only 1 install will last longer and no need to reinstall on new version release..
[11:10] <justmeh> @ megha it is true that a package may be updated several to dozens of times a year
[11:10] <justmeh> so you would need to download new versions as they come out - IF it matters to you
[11:11] <justmeh> you don't have to update I suppose, but i doubt very many people would cosign that as good behavior ;)
[11:11] <justmeh> megha, yeah, you will end up with a few extra packages here and there, but for the most part you can just upgrade again and again
[11:11] <megha> so just doing regular updates is fine :)
[11:11] <justmeh> sure ;)
[11:11] <megha> that's cool :)
[11:11] <justmeh> I tell mine to check and offer updates daily
[11:11] <Ben64> megha: until a new version of ubuntu comes out, then you should upgrade
[11:12] <justmeh> Ben64, don't confuse the package view with the os overall view
[11:12] <justmeh> true for os view, but don't run packages without checking for updates for 6 months
[11:12] <Ben64> i don't think he's asking about packages
[11:12] <justmeh> ben64 this is a help chan, so i tend to give a bit extra infoz
[11:12] <antonio_> does anyone here use Kdenlive?  For some reason playback is all screwed up...all the clips are playing double speed
[11:12] <justmeh> its also important to know how to think about stuffs
[11:13] <justmeh> not it @ antonio_
[11:13] <antonio_> ?
[11:13] <Ben64> megha: LTS versions released every 2 years, normal versions every 6 months
[11:14] <justmeh> ben64 - also biggest difference, is the normal versions keep more advanced packages
[11:14] <justmeh> the LTS versions _tend_ to keep more stable packages
[11:14] <Ben64> yep
[11:14] <megha> Ben64: so for eg if i  am  installing LTS version right now and say after 2 years i can upgrage to newer LTS without reinstalling the whole system ?
[11:14] <Ben64> megha: correct
[11:14] <justmeh> ^_^
[11:15] <justmeh> success!!
[11:15] <megha> cool
[11:15] <megha> :) :D
[11:15] <Ben64> next LTS is April 2014
[11:15] <megha> even this is true for norval versions ?
[11:15] <justmeh> and lts has extended support now, right ben? 5yrs instead of 3?
[11:15] <megha> normal*
[11:15] <Ben64> normal versions don't last as long
[11:15] <justmeh> megha, normal versions expire in 18 months
[11:15] <Ben64> justmeh: yes
[11:15] <justmeh> but you can mirror repos if you need to
[11:16] <megha> so after 18 months i have to reinstall my system ?
[11:16] <Ben64> best to do it after 6 months on normal releases
[11:16] <Ben64> or else you have to upgrade a few times at once
[11:16] <erupter> megha, you can keep on going just like lots of machines with winxp or ubuntu 8 do...
[11:17] <Ben64> then you miss out on security updates and bug fixes
[11:17] <justmeh> megha, let me break down for u
[11:17] <justmeh> today: 12.10 normal. 6 months: 13.04 normal, and so forth, this works very well
[11:17] <justmeh> today: 12.10 normal, 1 yr from now 13.10 normal; this works not so great
[11:18] <justmeh> today: 12.10 normal, 2 yrs from now (after 12.10 is fully dead for a few months) 14.04 - probably break
[11:18] <justmeh> so, when upgrading go one step at a time in the same line of releases
[11:18] <justmeh> normal upgrades normal, LTS upgrades LTS
[11:18] <headcr4sh> justmeh: I figured out the root cause of my problem (somehow) -- my DHCP client configuration contains a "request ntp-servers" section. So... obviously the DHCPClient was responsible for keeping my system time synced (usually a great mechanism, but as mentioned... I NEED to set my system time to a bogus value for some tests).
[11:18] <megha> justmeh: till what i understand is you are trying to say that that there is no need to reinstall the system when you are moving from 12.10 to 13.10 just a upgrage does your work
[11:18] <erupter> justmeh, I thought the only distro supposedly able to upgrade where the LTS ones, not the others...
[11:19] <headcr4sh> @ justme, others : thanks for your input anyways.
[11:19] <megha> sorry 12.10 to 13.04
[11:19] <headcr4sh> :-)
[11:19] <justmeh> megha, for 12.10 to 13.10 do 12.10->13.041->13.10
[11:19] <justmeh> yeah
[11:19] <Ben64> megha: yeah you can go 12.10 -> 13.04 -> 13.10 -> 14.04, or 12.04 -> 14.04
[11:20] <justmeh> @ headcr4sh - ok once your hwclock is good, then system time games can begin
[11:20] <justmeh> lets see here
[11:20] <megha> that's what i wanted to know it's cool to go on with your current ubuntu without reinstalling it :D :D :D
[11:20] <justmeh> yeah
[11:21] <justmeh> and if you really wanna do a big upgrade and be safe, you can dump your installed packages list, either from command line or synaptic, and you can also backup your /home/$USER directory
[11:24] <justmeh> hm
[11:24] <justmeh> @ headcr4sh i see what you mean

[11:40] <zetheroo> what does it take for an external screen on DVI port to be seen by Ubuntu?
[11:41] <vsMS01> Can anyone tell me, which kernel will come in Ubuntu 12.04.02 ?
[11:41] <justmeh> zetheroo, that its a supported live channel, that you have a vid driver for the card in question that supports multimons (most should now), and that you setup each mon separately in xconfig
[11:42] <Ben64> !info linux-generic precise | vsMS01
[11:42] <zetheroo> I added a screen to my T400 laptop ... and it's not being seen in the Displays panel in Ubuntu 12.04
[11:42] <ubottu> vsMS01: linux-generic (source: linux-meta): Complete Generic Linux kernel. In component main, is optional. Version 3.2.0.36.43 (precise), package size 1 kB, installed size 31 kB
[11:42] <zetheroo> if I use VGA its just fine ... but on DVI no go
[11:43] <vsMS01> I heard something about 3.5 will become the default in 12.04.02
[11:43] <cfhowlett> vsMS01, actual specs are on the website ...
[11:43] <vsMS01> cfhowlett: can you tell me the URL?
[11:44] <Ben64> vsMS01: 12.10 has 3.5
[11:44] <Ben64> not sure what you mean by 12.04.02
[11:44] <tux11211211> how do i check if my wirelss card is functioning
[11:44] <vsMS01> Ben64: I mean the upcoming point release
[11:44] <justmeh> zetheroo, maybe one is on a card and the other is onboard?
[11:44] <Ben64> i don't think they change kernels in the middle of releases, especially LTS
[11:45] <zetheroo> justmeh: ah, could that really be? This laptop has ATI and Intel gfx and atm is running on Intel only
[11:46] <justmeh> zetheroo, you may need to look at lspci -vvv to see what is attached where
[11:46] <Ben64> although... the daily builds do show 3.5 kernel... strange
[11:46] <vsMS01> I know that 3.5 is actually included in 12.04 and I also heard that it is supported But I also found https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Release/Rolling and in addition some comments in different lauchpad tickets
[11:46] <justmeh> might not quite get it from it, but that's a possibility, sorry i dont know that particular laptop good enough to tell
[11:49] <vsMS01> so linux-image-<flavour> linux-current should point to the quantal kernel now?
[11:50] <daze> I'm connecting to a IRC server that has a self-signed certificate. I want to add it to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/. How do I get it? xchat-gnome simply refuses to connect, not giving me an option of adding the certificate to my system (as does mIRC on win).

[11:52] <daze> _raven: community will port ubuntu phone to various models. if it runs android, it most likely will have a ubuntu version for it.
[11:53] <_raven> daze i plan to buy the padphone 2, hopefully it will be a version there for that then ;)
[11:54] <ThinkT510> !phone | _raven

[11:55] <daze> I mean the padphone
[11:55] <daze> it's a bigger screen for your phone

[11:58] <erbo> anyone know the status of thunderbolt support? does it still make your cpu go crazy to use a apple thunderbolt display under linux?
[11:58] <daze> wow, how thin is that clambook? O.O
[11:59] <justmeh> think macbook air
[12:00] <justmeh> so point is, whether padphone, or clambook, the phone is most certainly a legit target for *nix
[12:00] <MonkeyDust> win8 is the best thing that could happen to linux
[12:00] <Eagleman> Why does gpg keeps saying It is NOT certain that the key belongs to the person named in the user ID. If you *really* know what you are doing, you may answer the next question with yes.  I want to trust that key

[12:01] <justmeh> Eagleman, your gonna need the next dood up
[12:01] <justmeh> sorry :P

[12:03] <subdesign> i have 2 ubuntu computers connected trough a router but the speed seems like 10Mbit ..
[12:04] <Ben64> there are 8 bits in a byte
[12:05] <Eagleman> subdesign in the ideal situation= 100/8= 12.5MB/sec
[12:06] <subdesign> hm thanks
[12:06] <Eagleman> so your 10 mbit speed seems alright, but i think you are talking about MB not mbit
[12:06] <subdesign> so 12.5 should be okay
[12:07] <Eagleman> 12.5 is max with your hardware
[12:07] <subdesign> then all right
[12:07] <MonkeyDust> but max values tend to be theoretical

[12:10] <Lynx_> Hi all! I have some trouble starting sshd. I try with "sudo service ssh start" and get the message ist was started. But when I check with ps it's not running, and I also can't connect. Where would I find the error? Is there a log file?
[12:11] <erbo> Lynx_: Check /var/log/syslog
[12:12] <erbo> you can also try starting it manually to see if you get a clue to what's going on, "/usr/sbin/sshd -D"
[12:13] <Lynx_> erbo: Thanks, I found it already, I had a wrong option in the sshd_conf

[12:14] <erbo> nooooo: sudo apt-key update && sudo apt-get update
[12:14] <nooooo> but just with everything i want to install this happens
[12:15] <nooooo> erbo:  thx i ll try
[12:15] <MonkeyDust> nooooo  what's the output of lsb_release -sd ?
[12:15] <justmeh> btw daze short answer is openssh should be able to do it
[12:16] <justmeh> i had to 'phone a friend' but i gather the suggestion is to point it at the ircd
[12:16] <daze> ok, thanks. I'll look into it now ;)
[12:16] <justmeh> though, any good irc client should be able to ignore the self signed cert errors
[12:16] <justmeh> but i assume you want to explicitly accept this one, and not 'some others' ?
[12:16] <daze> yeah
[12:16] <justmeh> yeah that could differentiate one leaf from another
[12:16] <daze> accepting anything on connect isn't that safe :)

[12:20] <Lynx_> Another question: I have just installed Ubuntu, and have a second harddrive in my box. This gets mounted under /media/xxxx. I want to have this permanently mounted under /data, do I have to edit fstab to do this?
[12:20] <justmeh> Lynx_, yeah
[12:21] <justmeh> ok no
[12:21] <Lynx_> justmeh: ok, I thought maybe there was a gui way nowadays, I never know what the number in fstab mean...
[12:21] <justmeh> you can use gparted maybe
[12:22] <ThinkT510> !fstab | Lynx_
[12:22] <ubottu> Lynx_: The /etc/fstab file indicates how drive partitions are to be used or otherwise integrated into the file system. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Fstab and http://www.tuxfiles.org/linuxhelp/fstab.html and !Partitions
[12:23] <Lynx_> ThinkT510: cheers, I'll read that
[12:24] <justmeh> yeah gparted shows mount point but doesnt seem to set it
=== amit is now known as Guest13349
[12:28] <BluesKaj> justmeh, set the mount points with the partitioner when installing the OS
[12:31] <justmeh> BluesKaj, yeah, was looking for something within the full install to do the same thing
[12:31] <justmeh> for like 30s
[12:31] <justmeh> via gui
[12:31] <justmeh> there is something, i think, but i dont see it atm, too tired ^^;
[12:32] <BluesKaj> use manual partitioning . justmeh then you'll choose the partition , then change and choose / or /home or whatever you need
[12:33] <ThinkT510> BluesKaj: he isn't talking about partitioning an install, he just wants a gui front end for editing fstab
[12:35] <justmeh> ThinkT510, actually to be just slightly more precise, Lynx_ wanted it :P
[12:35] <BluesKaj> ok ThinkT510 , guess i should have scrolled back ...never heard of a fstab gui tho
[12:37] <MonkeyDust> Lynx_  try mountmanager, it's in the software center

[13:08] <MonkeyDust> goudkov  use apt-get, not aptitude
[13:08] <KNIGHT-RAK> how can stop ebox ?
[13:08] <Eagleman> fairuz, i wont end it with a file.tar.gz and file.tar.gz.gpg file?
[13:08] <goudkov> MonkeyDust: right. but is there some statement from ubuntu about it? or is it common wisdom?
[13:08] <goudkov> I've been using aptitude for a long time. really used to it.
[13:08] <MonkeyDust> !aptitude | goudkov there you go
[13:08] <ubottu> goudkov there you go: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[13:09] <goudkov> now, upgrading to 64-bit and things seems to not work
[13:09] <goudkov> so i'm trying to figure out if i should abandon aptitude completely and get used to apt-get instead
[13:09] <fairuz> Eagleman: If you pipe, you will not have the .tar
[13:10] <goudkov> MonkeyDust: ok, thanks
[13:13] <daze> justmeh: I was able to extract the certificate by using `openssl s_client -connect irc.myserver.net:6697` and copying the base64-encoded certificate block to a .crt file which I then imported into user's certificates. It seems to be good, except that the certificate in question is expired, so I'm not able to 100% confirm this. It expired ~20 days ago, so a new one should be issued by now. I'll alert the admins. Thanks for your help ;)
[13:14] <deathofbox> I was wondering if a computer using Linux can be hacked and remotely controlled.
[13:14] <deathofbox> Is it possible? I'm a little bit paranoid that I've been the target of an unscrupulous individual
[13:15] <MonkeyDust> deathofbox  wrong channel
[13:15] <ThinkT510> deathofbox: of course it can
[13:15] <MonkeyDust> deathofbox  discuss in #ubuntu-offtopic, please
[13:15] <deathofbox> ThinkT510: someone on Dalnet threatened to hack into my computer. He started doing a lot ctcp ping commands directed to my username. should I be scared?
[13:15] <iceroot> MonkeyDust: that is not offtopic here, its a security question
[13:16] <iceroot> deathofbox: no you should not be scared
[13:17] <deathofbox> Ok. Thanks for the reassurance. At the very least I have my firewall on if that helps at all.
[13:17] <ThinkT510> deathofbox: a ping is harmless
=== cryptfu_ is now known as Guest62103
[13:17] <iceroot> deathofbox: 1. when someone says "i will hack you" you know that it will not happen because a real hacker knows what the word "hacking" means, 2. there are a few things you can do to avoid security riscs, dont run software as root when not needed, dont give your passwords away, always install the latestes secuerity updates by using software-center
[13:18] <deathofbox> iceroot: Thank you very much for that! Pardon my ignorance if I throw around the word Hacker loosely. I will admit that I am completely ignorant when it comes to that subject matter.
[13:18] <cfhowlett> deathofbox, and do not use your administrative account for daily use.
[13:19] <deathofbox> cfhowlett: Gotcha. I'll create a non-administrative account then.
[13:19] <iceroot> deathofbox: but on GNU/Linux there is no reason to be afraid. its always good to be carefully and to ask if you have questions
[13:20] <deathofbox> iceroot: That's good to know. And yes, I agree that you can never be too careful.

[13:43] <cfhowlett> hambone2, what's the problem
[13:43] <hambone2> oh, nice, not much chatting atm, confused me.
[13:44] <cfhowlett> hambone2, this is the support channel.  general chit chat is in #ubuntu-offtopic
[13:44] <BluesKaj> yeah ,real busy in here today
[13:45] <cfhowlett> BluesKaj, must mean those *buntu systems are working right!
[13:46] <hambone2> I use Ubuntu on my own computer and like it very much. Thanks for the great experience, but... my dad's new computer came with Windows8 and it is messed up. I wanted to just put Ubuntu on it, but the new computer is like locked up or something with that new "secure boot" that is preinstalled on some Dell computers.
[13:46] <goshHates> everything written before a "but" is superfluous :D

For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[13:47] <FlowRiser> cfhowlett,  yes, same thing on my school computer ... O.o
[13:47] <FlowRiser> can't even boot of usb because of password, can't install from wubi ... i'm stuck using windows
[13:47]  * cfhowlett *wubi*  shudder ...
[13:48] <Ben64> they keep saying secure boot won't stop linux or anything, but so many people have problems with it
[13:49] <FlowRiser> why do a secure boot ? what was wrong with the las one ? >.<
[13:49] <BluesKaj> cfhowlett, flow no cdrom drive
[13:49] <BluesKaj> oops
[13:49] <ericshell> does anyone know how to add a window manager manually built to the list of available managers at the login screen of ubuntu 12? i cant remember, been a while
[13:49] <hambone2> So, here is my question: Is there a way to download an image file on my Ubuntu computer, burn that image to a DVD with Brasero and then use that DVD to start the UEFI computer? I'm confused because when I went to download Ubuntu for Windows it offered me a file with an .exe extention, which I don't think will work right as a booter.
[13:50] <ericshell> built e16 but cant get it to list at the login screen
[13:50] <cfhowlett> BluesKaj, you?  I heard PXE is the method for a no drive option ... or USB
[13:50] <BluesKaj> I meant FlowRiser , no cdrom or usb
[13:50] <BluesKaj> ?
[13:50] <cfhowlett> hambone2, ubuntu for windows is wubi.  Not recommended except for testing ubuntu
[13:50] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, it has a password on bios and it's set to boot from the hdd first O.o
[13:51] <Ben64> FlowRiser: get rid of the password
[13:51] <FlowRiser> I know, but that would mean opening the case!
[13:51] <Ben64> yep
[13:52] <BluesKaj> what about boot sequence ..perhaps gparted on media can help ?
[13:52] <FlowRiser> i think those pcs are new or something, coul void their warranty ... Plus, i doubt the teacher won't notice me  opening the case.
[13:52] <maxagaz_> do you know a tool to convert a psd image to gimp xfc image (keeping all the elements of the image) ?
[13:52] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, i tried that ...
[13:53] <maxagaz_> I mean psd to xcf
[13:53] <FlowRiser> maxagaz_, yes, use gimp
[13:53] <cfhowlett> maxagaz_, gimp
[13:53] <hambone2> Is there a version of Ubuntu that comes with the "secure key" that lets Windows8 preloaded machines recognize it as an authentic OS?

[13:55] <ericshell> does anyone know how to add a window manager manually built to the list of available managers at the login screen of ubuntu 12? i cant remember, been a while
[13:55] <BluesKaj> FlowRiser, what did you try ?
[13:56] <hambone2> Thank you cfhowlett, but the new Win8 machine won't even boot up at all. The Win8 OS is refusing to boot, plus I hated it anyway, but when I went to load up Ubuntu it wouldn't recognize the boot disk because or "secure boot." I will read the blue link from ubottu...
[13:57] <MonkeyDust> ericshell  this here shows how to remove them, guess it helps if you want to add some http://askubuntu.com/questions/81161/how-to-remove-session-entries-from-lightdm

[13:58] <Beifong> isn't there a option for wget to stop trying when a read error occurs
[13:58] <Beifong> I've checked all the options in --help
[13:59] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, i tried booting of cd, usb, wubi, assisted boot, parting a partition and installing manually on that (didn't have enough permisiions to do that)
[13:59] <hambone2> @cfhowlett, yes, we will take the machine back to the store if we can't get Ubuntu loaded, but are trying to avoid that because we live way out in the country and the store is miles away. I think I see the solution on the ubottu link. It says download the 64 bit version on Ubuntu and it will be able to talk to the newfangled laptops.
[14:01] <njd001> I am looking for a way to convert my physical HDD into an image so i can wipe my corporate image install ubuntu and then boot my corporate image as a vm in ubuntu any suggestions ?
[14:01] <cfhowlett> njd001, dd or remastersys are tools to look into
[14:01] <blackangel> i get this message window:
[14:01] <blackangel> One or more tools required for installations cannot be found on the system.
[14:01] <blackangel> Install the required tool before installing the fglrx driver. Optionally, run the
[14:01] <blackangel> installer with --force option to instal without the tools. Forcing install will disable AMD hardware acceleration and may make your system unstable.
[14:01] <blackangel> Not recommend.

[14:06] <hambone2> Uh, I would have picked a torrent, but the link sent me to a short list. Good idea though, I don't like waiting 15 minutes for the image file to download, plus I can pay back by seeding when I find it.
[14:06] <njd001> i was pondering DD i'll go read but i assume DD would run from LiveCD boot and allow me to dump it to an external disk.
[14:06] <Pinkamena_D> my bad

[14:07] <njd001> thanks guys!

[14:50] <jhutchins> Makdaam: In other words yes, you just have to do manual package selection and not select a desktop environment.
[14:50] <bab> orudie, good question
[14:50] <Makdaam> jhutchins: I can't even get to the installer terminal :) because the curses installer can't work without a graphics card

[15:12] <deadmund> How do I use the dig command to look up a specific domain name at a specific dns server?  (For example, dig yahoo.com @8.8.8.8  is timing out, what am I doing wrong?)
[15:12] <MraAlbertina> w1k: wow from atary800 ... :o can you help me installing on my microwave (900 watts)?
[15:13] <leecy> Hi
=== Guest45428 is now known as _stack
[15:14] <leecy> I'm having a problem with USB input devices going through a KVM to Ubuntu
[15:14] <leecy> occasionally, Ubuntu will cease listening to the devices and won't resume listening until restarted
[15:16] <heywood> what are the best options for remote accessing an ubuntu box behind a firewall/NAT router from outside the network? is the current version of ssh and related tools considered to be secure? i have 12.04.1 LTS.
[15:16] <leecy> dmesg results shows a barrage of errors hub_port_status failed (err = -110)
[15:16] <deadmund> heywood: yes, ssh is very secure
[15:17] <leecy> I was able to get to dmesg because I also have a PS/2 keyboard and mouse set on the computer- this seems to happen with every distro I use
[15:19] <orudie> Hi. I am running ubuntu 12.04 with two monitors. When I switch between desktop workspaces (with "ctrl+alt left, right), it shifts two desktop spaces left or right. Is there a way to change it so that it shifts only one workspace, instead of two ?
[15:19] <leecy> any idea why this can happen? I also have two Wintel boxes and a Mac connected to the same KVM, and they don't exhibit this behavior.
[15:19] <heywood> deadmund: ok, ssh gets me a root shell for basic admin tasks. if i want to do something fancier (tunneling a VNC connection through it, exporting a display, etc.), what else would i need to install? something like vncviewer?
[15:20] <deadmund> heywood: You should never ssh as root or allow the root user to ssh.  YOu should ssh as yourself (a normal user) and then use sudo or su if you need to.
[15:20] <deadmund> heywood: To vnc you need to install vncviewer :P  I can find a guide if you need more specifics.  BTW, vnc over the Internet is slow.
[15:21] <deadmund> heywood: http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/vnc/sshvnc.html
[15:21] <deadmund> heywood: ssh -X (referred to as x forwarding) is more efficient
[15:22] <Wiz_KeeD> help! :(
[15:22] <heywood> deadmund: ah, ok. but i'm a little confused about ubuntu's users setup. right now the root password is not enabled (as per ubuntu default), but my one user account is labelled as administrative.
[15:22] <heywood> deadmund: so i can ssh into the box as myself, then sudo for admin stuff.
[15:23] <heywood> deadmund: i have a remote X server running here so ssh -X would work just fine.
[15:23] <deadmund> heywood: Yeah, your account is administrative meaning you can assume the identity of root (by using sudo).  Sudo users your own password to switch to the root user, thus there is not root password
[15:23] <deadmund> heywood: ssh as yourself, then use sudo, that is correct
[15:23] <deadmund> heywood: ssh -X is great :)
[15:23] <heywood> deadmund: so is it the case than an "administrative" user is just incloded in sudoers?
[15:24] <enbloc> when using ssh with X forwarding, if I run firefox on the remote machine, it appears to see if I have one running locally, and it then opens a tab in my local firefox, refusing to create a new instance on the remote machine (which may not have the same network visibility). I've tried to disable this, but my googlefu is weak, and I can't accurately and uniquely describe the problem in searchable terms.
[15:24] <phschwartz> What is the best channel to ask questions about deb packaging for ubuntu?
[15:24] <heywood> phschwartz: #ubuntu-packaging ?
[15:25] <deadmund> heywood: in ubuntu, yes
[15:25] <deadmund> enchilado: firefox --no-remote
[15:25] <enbloc> thanks deadmund
[15:26] <deadmund> enbloc: sure
[15:26] <Lofde_> I am using ubuntu, i have a hard drive that i took out of a windows 8 machine, it has all kinds of weird partitions an ESP 524mb fat, DIAGS 42 fat, Unknown 134mb, WINRETOOLS 524MB NTFS, an OS partition 491GB, and a PBR Image 7.8GB NTFS.. i did a "sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd bs=512" and wrote 0's to the entire drive, but i still cant 'format' the drive, when i try to ask for a password to authenticate can anyone help?
[15:27] <heywood> deadmund: ok. so since i have everything else set up, is it just a matter of starting sshd (manually, via init.d, etc.) on the ubuntu box then?
[15:27] <deadmund> heywood: If you installed openssh-server it will be started by default for you (already placed in init.d)
[15:28] <heywood> deadmund: ah, ok. i haven't (yet). do you know if the post-install scripts run by apt would start it?
[15:29] <deadmund> heywood: I don't know if it starts after install...
[15:29] <deadmund> heywood: you can start it: sudo service sshd start
[15:29] <bono> Lofde_: dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdd even zeroes the partition table; you need a new one. I recommend gparted
[15:30] <BluesKaj> Lofde_, this might help , but since you've aready tried write 0s to drive , dunno if it will work , http://askubuntu.com/questions/221835/installing-ubuntu-on-a-pre-installed-uefi-supported-windows-8-system
[15:30] <heywood> deadmund: that's easy enough. last thing: my router can do port forwarding (though it's not set up right now). as i recall, ssh listens on port 22. is there any security benefit in forwarding some high-numbered port from the WAN to 22 on the LAN side?
[15:30] <Lofde_> these uefi pc's are making me so mad... i had to change all kinds of bios settings to install windows 7 to that computer and replace the drive to get it to function... no one likes windows 8 :/
[15:31] <goshHates> Lofde_ thats why they force us to use that shit :]
[15:31] <goshHates> no1 would use win8 if it wasnt such a pain in the ass to change the os =D
[15:31] <goshHates> but its even more cruel to use win8, so its worth the time changing :>
[15:32] <deadmund> heywood: I'm glad you brought that up! ! :)
[15:32] <BluesKaj> lof  it's not windows 8 itself , it MS trying to become more proprietary and prevent , or making it a PITA to install other OSs in guise of security features
[15:32] <BluesKaj> Lofde_,^'
[15:33] <Lofde_> **f*cking windows 8.... get bill gates in here**
[15:33] <deadmund> heywood: generally, using a non-standard port is rather effective at hiding from script kiddies.  However, this is security through obscurity.  Basically you're not hiding in a better place, just a different place.  So... yeah.  What's better is to use some of the automated systems that automatically block brute force attempts by watching logs and editing a blocklist.
[15:33] <hje841> any one got an idea as to why /dev/ttyUSB0 gives 'resource temporarily unavailable' in my own code (C++) when it's run on a 12.04 in a vm on Win7? ( I know)
[15:33] <deadmund> heywood: like this

=== MartinS is now known as Guest77116
[15:34] <heywood> deadmund: main issue for me is that i just left the place where the ubuntu box is, and am now far away for a while :(
[15:34] <heywood> unfortunately i didn't have time to set up secure remote access before i left
[15:34] <deadmund> heywood: You generally can't configure the router from outside the lan
[15:34] <Pici> heywood, deadmund: fail2ban is a popular tool for preventing login attempts.
[15:34] <heywood> so i have to walk a (very non-technical) person through those steps.
[15:34] <Pici> !info fail2ban
[15:34] <ubottu> fail2ban (source: fail2ban): ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.8.7.1-1 (quantal), package size 86 kB, installed size 434 kB
[15:34] <deadmund> Pici: thanks :)
[15:35] <Astradeus> ubuntu-precise: how can i find the package which created a user/group? (ssl-cert or scanner for example)
[15:35] <deadmund> heywood: yes, have fun!  Easiest thing might be to ssh in, shut off ssh and then go there yourself when you get a chance
[15:35] <Wiz_KeeD> Can someone please help me remove repositories form 12.04? :(
[15:36] <Wiz_KeeD> i tried editing the source.list and i see no extra repository there maybe i missed something :(
[15:36] <heywood> deadmund: i will certainly do that when i'm there next. but i need to do some admin in the meantime, so stopping sshd altogether won't work.
[15:36] <heywood> i'll try sshguard and fail2ban, as you suggested.
[15:37] <deadmund> heywood: If it's short term there is very low chance the brute force attacks will work.  Especially if you have an ever remotely good password
[15:37] <soahccc> How can I prevent ssh from sending my key? I found two settings but they are v1 specific :/
[15:37] <heywood> and i have LAN-side config disabled on the router, so i'll need to get that fixed via "meatspace VNC" (i.e. asking the non-techie person over the phone to type specific things at the keyboard)
[15:38] <heywood> deadmund: password is reasonably safe behind the firewall, but if i'm going to expose it to the big bad Intarwebs i'll feel safer with a much longer one
[15:38] <deadmund> heywood: yeah, well... sounds like you need to instruct that meat-bag
[15:38] <heywood> (not schneier's "epic passpoem," but something similar)
[15:39] <wjtaylor_> Does anyone else have trouble clicking on icons in nautilus? It works in list view, but not with icons.
[15:39] <Lofde_> i can understand them using uefi , but they've made this hard drive some how password encrypted where changes to it cant be made :/.. the user didnt set any special hard drive password to it.. gparted is giving me an error when trying to change the partition table..
[15:39] <heywood> deadmund: errr... that "meat-bag" is my dad :o

[15:46] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  I havent followed, try sudo apt-get -f install // also check if you do not have a mix of i386 and amd64 packages
[15:46] <BluesKaj> Lofde_, my understanding is the partitioning has to be done insude w8 then the page i p[osted has instructions how to work around the uefi and get to the bios (most) machines still have it but it's hidden , then you can setup the boot sequence etc

[15:48] <Pici> Wiz_KeeD: You said you couldn't locate the sources.list for the extra repository.  The files in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ get sourced for entries, so you might find the file you're looking for in there.

[15:50] <Wiz_KeeD> http://pastie.org/5824860
[15:50] <Wiz_KeeD> this all started because of some broken packages MonkeyDust :(
[15:52] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  are you using PPAs ?
[15:52] <Wiz_KeeD> I think i've added one when i tried to add some software to browse my android phone
[15:52] <Wiz_KeeD> which can only be placed in media transfer shit something
[15:52] <Wiz_KeeD> and i added a repo then but i forgot it's name
[15:53] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  i guess that PPA is the culprit
[15:53] <Wiz_KeeD> that's why i wanted to remove it, how can i remove it? :(
[15:53] <MonkeyDust> !ppa-purge
[15:53] <ubottu> To disable a PPA from your sources and revert your packages back to default Ubuntu packages, install ppa-purge and use the command: « sudo ppa-purge ppa:<repository-name>/<subdirectory> » – For more information, see http://www.webupd8.org/2009/12/remove-ppa-repositories-via-command.html
[15:53] <Wiz_KeeD> that's just it, repository-name
[15:54] <Wiz_KeeD> i don't know it :(
[15:54] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  or system settings, sources
[15:54] <Wiz_KeeD> no such thing as sources in system settings
[15:55] <MonkeyDust> Wiz_KeeD  it's software sources
[15:55] <Lofde_> success, i dont know how but after writing all 0's to the entire disk, using gparted and trying over and over to 'write a new partition table to it' it would keep erroring out, telling me it was unsuccessfully but slowly started deleting one partition at a time and finally i could write a proper partition table and then format the drive :)

[17:01] <orudie> i installed dconf-editor, and trying to get to org/gnome/shell/overrides to find the option called workspaces-only-on-primary , but the path org/gnome/shell/ does not exist. i can only get ti /org/gnome in dconf-editor
[17:02] <marcreichelt> I have an Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS 64 bit server installed. I *need* sun-java6-jdk, that's why I installed it via the Flexion script as described on http://www.gaggl.com/2012/04/installing-java6-jdk-on-ubuntu-12-04/
[17:02] <marcreichelt> But now when I want to install tomcat or jenkins APT says it will install the openjdk-6, which I want to prevent
[17:03] <marcreichelt> is there any good way to install Java-based applications from APT without installing the openjdk?
[17:04] <ouyes> I have windows7 64bits on my laptop, and I installed ubuntu 12.04 32bits via usb drive, but I find that, the grub was installed to my usb drive, once I remove the usb drive, there is no boot option to ubuntu,(UEFI).how can make dual boot possible without my usb drive?

[18:22] <freakynl> Soelen: ok, so when you go to say http://whatever whatever can not be resolved (in this case by definition as whatever is not a fqdn, whatever.com would but but if that does not resolve the same applies)
[18:23] <freakynl> so your dns client adds the search domain, fritz.box in this case, making the request whatever.fritz.box
[18:23] <freakynl> your router (a fritz box apparently :)) has a dns file stating *.fritz.box points to that IP

=== daftykin1 is now known as daftykins
[18:25] <freakynl> so there's a bunch of things you can do, remove the search domain, use another dns server, change the DNS server on the fritzbox if that's possible. Any of them can solve the issue, the middle one alone doesn't please people though as your box will regularly send requests for something.fritz.box to an external DNS server then who doesn't know what to do with it
[18:26] <Ian_Corne> Greetings
[18:26] <freakynl> Soelen: Oh, I misread, thought you had the issue that http://notarealdomain went to that box, but yes, you can set up a dns server that responds with whatever IP on whatever request you send it

I personally don't have a preference, but if you feel more comfortable with one than the other ;). Proxy will need to be setup on client (although you could use auto config or something) DNS server (and search domain) can be pushed with DHCP (if they override the DNS to 8.8.8.8 for examp

Right now, neither one can be managed as they're not available it appear. However, they're manageable via command line (e.g., iwconfig/wpa_cli/ifconfig)
[18:49] <daftykins> xj54y: if you've got any manual config in /etc/network/interfaces that will stop NM working
[18:51] <xj54y> daftykins, I had thought the same thing, which leads me to my next question.

[19:05] <orudie> Hi. I am running ubuntu 12.04 with two monitors. When I switch between desktop workspaces (with "ctrl+alt left, right), it shifts two desktop spaces left or right. Is there a way to change it so that it shifts only one workspace, instead of two ?
[19:05] <tyler_d> orudie: it is only going one over, appears to be two as it's 2 monitors wide
[19:06] <tyler_d> orudie: the answer, is not that I'm aware of

For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process.

[19:40] <trism> daze: interesting, which key is this?

[19:43] <trism> daze: ahh interesting, I don't have that file, but it seems you can move appindicators anyway then...won't work for the clock though
[19:43] <daze> yeah, I created that file manually
[19:43] <daze> and the corresponding folder
[19:44] <daze> I'm reading http://www.webupd8.org/2011/06/how-to-change-application-indicators.html

[19:46] <daze> it seems the clock is stuck on the right no matter what, along with the sound and other system indicators
[19:46] <daze> but other than that, all 'additional' indicators can be ordered that way :]
[19:47] <trism> daze: yeah, that file is loaded by indicator-application, which handles all the appindicators, but full indicators will still be locked in place since they are hardcoded in the panel-service.c file
[19:47] <trism> daze: still, better than nothing. hopefully someone will add the gsettings key so all the indicators will be reorderable eventually

[20:01] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_ remove it
[20:01] <Lededje> jrib: That has fixed it but it is still peculiar that the other info function didn't work

[20:03] <Lededje> jirb: or I can stick a fiver in a charity box of your choosing
[20:03] <Mary_> PrimeCl0ver: thank you.  so you are saying icinga is better than nagios?
[20:03] <jrib> Lededje: it's ok, thanks :)
[20:03] <letozaf_> hi
[20:03] <Lededje> jrib: Very humble, many thanks
[20:04] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_, I say neither is better then the other. Icinga is a fork of Nagios. I personally prefer Icinga's new interface and their PHP api. Nagios and Icinga can share plugins and the core engine of Icinga stays in line with Nagios's feature set.
[20:04] <Vorenii> hi guys
[20:04] <Vorenii> anyone willing to helpme with my sound issue?
[20:05] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_, I hope that helps.
[20:05] <Mary_> PrimeCl0ver:  i find nagios difficult due to lack of docs.  is Icinga have better docs ?
[20:05] <Mary_> but yes interface looks better?
[20:05] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_, The documentation on Icinga is very good and they also have a really good IRC channel on FreeNode
[20:06] <Mary_> PrimeCl0ver: yes nagios irc is dead!
[20:06] <Mary_> PrimeCl0ver: have you used both ?
[20:06] <ironhalik> Do I need additional driver for my touchpad on thinkpad x220?
[20:06] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_, I started 8 years ago on Nagios and about 3 years ago on Icinga.
[20:06] <ironhalik> I currently have just left click, and the touchpad will not support multitouch
[20:07] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_, I personally suggest this combination. Icinga/PNP/Check_MK
[20:07] <Mary_> PrimeCl0ver: i wish i had asked before doing all this works! but glad you gave me get me hints
[20:07] <Mary_> PrimeCl0ver: i assume you do this all on ubuntu server? and it there good tutorial for Ubuntu?
[20:08] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_, The configs you made for Nagios can be used in Icinga.
[20:08] <PrimeCl0ver> Mary_, Yes my Icinga servers are spread across 10 Ubuntu 12.04 servers.

[20:13] <ubottu> wachpwnski: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[20:13] <k1l> wachpwnski: that is the 12.04. its focused on stability

[20:18] <ttl-> jrib: where are the keyring files stored in 12.04
[20:18] <Hackbat> I have a card that works with it but it's only G and it's like 10% of the speed of the alfa
[20:18] <ttl-> jrib: command line is fine too :)
[20:19] <jrib> ttl-: I don't know the default location of the file
[20:19] <jrib> ttl-: if you've copied them to your new home, seahorse should just find them

[20:59] <pc05> UFF
[20:59] <enapupe> adriann: what do you mean? like a virtual machine? or dual boot?
[20:59] <adriann> as a dualboot.
[20:59] <enapupe> IDK, I must say I lost big time to make OSx run on a VM inside ubuntu, didn't worth it.
[21:00] <adriann> i already have both osx and windows installed on it. each on its own harddrive.
[21:00] <Vorenii> ncsquid22, that didnt work aswell
[21:00] <hilo> is there a way to set a motd message for CLI logins
[21:00] <adriann> I also have a harddrive ready for ubuntu.
[21:00] <Vorenii> great this linux stuff :')
[21:00] <ncsquid22> damm!
[21:00] <enapupe> adriann: who is controlling the boot?
[21:01] <jrib> hilo: sure, read: « man update-motd »
[21:01] <ncsquid22> I am sorry Vorenii. I might have to do some extra research....
[21:01] <hilo> jrib, ty
[21:01] <Vorenii> i threw my windows off :(

[21:03] <enapupe> adriann: I think it will. Anyhow, grub is your best friend to make it work
[21:03] <ncsquid22> i think the instructions say the file needs to end with .conf

[21:56] <corbolma> ok
[21:56] <bianca> in windows you can just drag and drop anything whereeve you want it to go! :)
[21:56] <bianca> and apparently ubuntu has more freedom -_-
[21:57] <jrib> bianca: I'm 99% certain that you should not be copying things to /usr yourself.

[22:03] <XMLnewbi> is it bad to run nginx side by side with apache?

[22:03] <bianca> 12.10
[22:04] <[snake]> jrib I ran the sudo apt-get install -f like they said, and that is the output. I was installing ia32-libs-gtk when it happened.
[22:04] <jhutchins> xlnt.  Let me check some details for you.
[22:04] <jrib> [snake]: did you read the bug report?
[22:04] <bianca> i found  this in the software center ATI binary X.Org driver
[22:04] <jrib> bianca: what do you mean by "this"?
[22:04] <bianca> apparently it breaks unity but better than nothing i guess
[22:04] <MichaelP> ubuntu 12.04 LTS sence it's long term does it get the newer kernels and other newer packages of 12.10. or is it always going to stay behind ?
[22:04] <[snake]> jrib, reading it now
[22:04] <bekks> MichaelP: yes.
[22:04] <bianca> jrib what are you talking about
[22:05] <bekks> MichaelP: But it willbe supported much longer than 12.10
[22:05] <jrib> MichaelP: the kernels are backported to LTS releases (apt-cache search -n linux-image backport)
[22:05] <jhutchins> bianca: Try sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
[22:05] <jrib> bianca: I'm trying to understand what you say.
[22:05] <bianca> this is a word commonly used in the english language,
[22:05] <k1l_> MichaelP: the focus is not on the newest releases of the software
[22:05] <tripelb> my phone says that it is connected via USB and yet LSUSB does not show my phone what am I missing?
[22:05] <jrib> bianca: I know what the word means.  I'm asking what "this" refers to.
[22:06] <yakusa48> which one is better LAMPP (ubuntu) or XAMPP for Linux (apachefriend)?
[22:06] <jrib> !lamp | yakusa48
[22:06] <ubottu> yakusa48: LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process.
[22:06] <MichaelP> So the concept of LTS is like debian.. Working on it longer to make for a more stable system ?
[22:06] <bekks> yakusa48: Neither nor. Just install the according ubuntu packages.
[22:06] <jrib> yakusa48: use the lamp setup ubottu described; that way you get updates from the repositories

[22:25] <kish> !notunity
[22:25] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[22:33] <k1l_> bianca: repository
[22:34] <jhutchins> bianca: repository (of ubuntu packages).
[22:34] <bekks> craigbass1976: The external IP is normally not pingable from within a network.
[22:34] <dr_willis> craigbass1976:  so the only issue is the pinging? or are there other problems?
[22:34] <bianca> i got my drivers from the ati website and its missing the 32bit libarys
[22:34] <jhutchins> bianca: the ia32-libs package causes several others to install, but I can't tell if it includes the glx stuff.  Seems to be pretty much everything.
[22:34] <k1l_> Baribal: well :)  i just mentioned because most users will find it easier to do this within the gui
[22:34] <jhutchins> bianca: What program gives you this error?
[22:35] <craigbass1976> dr_willis, no traffic at all is getting through this box from the lan.  I can ping 8.8.8.8 from here, but agian not from the laptop.  And can't browse, ssh, check email, etc from the lan either
[22:35] <Baribal> k1l_, so do I, and that'd be what I'd have tried locally. :) But on this machine, no dice.
[22:35] <jhutchins> bianca: The OLD answer - the one that worked - was to build a 32b install for running 32b, either as a multi-boot or a VM.
[22:35] <bianca> whaat..
[22:35] <bianca> can linux do anything..
[22:35] <jhutchins> bianca: Asking the ATI drivers to do multiarch when multiarch is not really working yet is a lot.
[22:36] <bianca> so what do i do? just not have open gl? let my $300 graphics card go to waist?

[22:41] <jhutchins> SonikkuAmerica: THe problem is the 32b ATI drivers in a 64b env, and I don't even know that it's a problem, but it's certainly a stretch to run software on the wrong OS on the wrong arch.
[22:41] <bianca> this is just me repeating myself over and over and over and over and over and over
[22:41] <ActionParsnip> bianca: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[22:41] <jhutchins> bianca: Steam also supports linux now.
[22:41] <bianca> idk what that means
[22:41] <bekks> nander: Never heard of a setup like that - and you cant distinguish between authed/anon access until the user finally authed/used anon access.
[22:41] <ActionParsnip> bianca: in a terminal, run the command. What is output?
[22:42] <jhutchins> ActionParsnip: She's on 12.10.
[22:42] <bekks> nander: So technically, you cant close IPs for anon access.
[22:42] <nander> damm..
[22:42] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: seems to be, alsamixer is the only thing i'v tried and got that error, this is a fresh install too. installed ssh, apache, a few other things and nothing else.
[22:42] <nander> So I have to choose to block anon access or to use ip tables and block users I want to be able to authenticate?
[22:43] <ActionParsnip> bianca: ok, then run:  sudo apt-get install fglrx fglrx-amdcccle     and reboot. Done.
[22:43] <bianca> Ubuntu 12.10 \n \l
[22:43] <ActionParsnip> bianca: did you do that?
[22:43] <bianca> yes
[22:43] <bekks> nander: Correct. Thats because you only know wether a user uses anon access AFTER entering the credentials.
[22:43] <ActionParsnip> bianca: have you tried running: sudo aticonfig --initial
[22:43] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: Weird.
[22:44] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: What sound driver does it currently use?
[22:44] <bianca> Found fglrx primary device section
[22:44] <bianca> Using /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[22:44] <bianca> Saving back-up to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.fglrx-0
[22:44] <ActionParsnip> bianca: have you used that command before?
[22:44] <bianca> no
[22:45] <ActionParsnip> bianca: but its on the how to guide made by canonical for your GPU, so why not?
[22:46] <bianca> ? i dont know what your talking about
[22:46] <dirkounet> hello
[22:47] <bianca> i didnt do a guide, i just got the linux 86, 64 bit drivers from the ati website
[22:47] <ActionParsnip> bianca: The command is on the guide for ATI GPUs for Ubuntu. Surely this would be the FIRST page you went to.....
[22:47] <dirkounet> maybe someone can help here. Trying to connect my usb-stick to ubuntu 12.10, but nothing is mounted, no icon on desktop etc
[22:47] <ActionParsnip> bianca: logically
[22:47] <bianca> SORRY THAT I DONT KNOW EVERY WEBSITE EVER CREATED
[22:47] <ActionParsnip> dirkounet: is it a 3G stick?
[22:47] <dirkounet> but its listed when doing lsusb
[22:47] <bianca> dick.
[22:47] <k1l_> ActionParsnip: i think there was the old windows driver install way back in mind
[22:47] <ActionParsnip> bianca: but a simple web search would have showed you, you don't have to know every page
[22:48] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: this is the code i use "sudo chmod -R a+rwX /dev/snd"
[22:48] <SonikkuAmerica> dirkounet: Try [ sudo mount <whatever the location of the USB stick is> ]

[22:48] <Dice-Man> hello how to configure my keyboard on 12.10 ?
[22:48] <k1l_> bianca: people are trying to help you. so calm down

[22:48] <dirkounet> i simply want to have an automount (for the iphone it works without doing anything)
[22:48] <bianca> no hes just harassing me
[22:49] <codephobic> How do I get Ubuntu's boot menu to find an install of Debian on my system?
[22:49] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: I'm not familiar with that switch syntax... can you give me a numeric equivalent for (-R a+rwX)?
[22:49] <sw> Hi, if I have a 512 MB / 1 CPU / 20 GB SSD Disk server, should I run 12.10 32-bit or 64-bit?
[22:49] <ActionParsnip> bianca: instead of trying to guess how things work in an OS you are clearly not versed with, why not try and find guides on how to do it properly, you'll be less frustrated when what you think is how something is done doesn't work
[22:49] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: 777 maybe?
[22:49] <ActionParsnip> bianca: i gave you the official how to, and you clearly haven't read it
[22:49] <bianca> im not finding this guide your talking about
[22:49] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: "sudo update-grub" should see it.
[22:49] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: alsa says the card is nvidia, chipset  Conexant CX20561 (Hermosa)
[22:49] <k1l_> bianca: no he is not. dont take it personally that something doesnt work like you thing it should be
[22:50] <bianca> well thats a lie you did no such thing
[22:50] <ActionParsnip> sw: I'd go for xubuntu 32bit or Lubuntu 32bit
[22:50] <dirkounet> SonikkuAmerica: as i said, mounting manually works
[22:50] <bianca> your pissing me off and not helping
[22:50] <codephobic> katsumeblisk, I tried that but doesn't pick up the debian install
[22:50] <ActionParsnip> 22:38 < ActionParsnip> !ati | bianca
[22:50] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: That's the GPU, not the sound card
[22:50] <sw> ActionParsnip: No desktop environment, server ... Definetly 32-bit though?
[22:50] <rbookhouse> When my pc does absolutely nothing (even when its been doing nothing for hours) the hard disk light still blinks every 2 seconds or so... is there a way to completely stop the light blinking (without physically cutting the connection) - the pc is in a bedroom and its very annoying
[22:50] <ActionParsnip> bianca: right before you wrote 'i give up'
[22:50] <SonikkuAmerica> dirkounet: Oh, I see.
[22:50] <codephobic> I installed debian on a second hd (sdb) but within a logical partition. I'm not sure if that affects anything.
[22:50] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: Is os-prober installed?
[22:50] <codephobic> katsumeblisk, hmm not sure, how would I check?
[22:51] <Dizzle> rbookhouse put a piece of tape over it?
[22:51] <ActionParsnip> sw: if the cpu is 64bit then i'd go 64bit
[22:51] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: "sudo apt-get install os-prober"
[22:51] <ActionParsnip> bianca: anyhoo, try a reboot now
[22:51] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: If it is, it won't do anything. if it isn't it'll install.
[22:51] <rbookhouse> Dizzle, that doesn't stop it blinking
[22:51] <codephobic> ah, k I'll check now
=== codezombie|away is now known as codezombie
[22:51] <Dizzle> rbookhouse sorry i was under the impression the light was bothering you
[22:51] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: i thought so
[22:51] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: Which distro did you install second?
[22:52] <codephobic> seems to be already installed
[22:52] <codephobic> katsumeblisk, I installed debian squeeze.
[22:52] <rbookhouse> Dizzle, it does - but i want it to stop blinking - not hide the fact its blinking
[22:52] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: After Ubuntu?
[22:52] <codephobic> katsumeblisk, yes
[22:52] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: When it asked to install a boot loader, did you pick no?
[22:53] <codephobic> katsumeblisk, the problem is that I didn't install grub at the end of the debian install... I figured Ubuntu's grub2 would pick it up, but not working.
[22:53] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: in alsamixer, i press f2 for sys info and it closes
[22:53] <codephobic> katsumeblisk, I did pick "no", thinking grub2 (ubuntu) would find it.
[22:54] <codephobic> instead grub2 finds old (removed) instances of debian and ubuntu, rather than the fresh install
[22:54] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: Can you run update-grub and post the output to pastebin?
[22:54] <codephobic> I think I need to clean up grub
[22:54] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: I'll take a look.
[22:54] <codephobic> k, one moment
[22:54] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: this is where i got the chmod code: http://plethoracomputers.com/index.php/component/option,com_kunena/Itemid,277/catid,4/func,view/id,89/
[22:54] <katsumeblisk> codephobic: You could also try reinstalling grub in Ubuntu.
[22:55] <codephobic> katsumeblisk, I tried that
[22:55] <countley> is there a good speech recognition  for ubuntu
[22:55] <codephobic> (as well as update-grub), but neither have found debian.

[23:05] <ActionParsnip> bianca: driver=fglrx_pci    driver is loaded
[23:06] <ActionParsnip> bianca: not sure. I've seen high end cards say similar. I wouldn't sweat it
[23:06] <bianca> it should be like 800mhz?
[23:06] <bianca> well its still giving me the error
[23:07] <k1l_> which error?
[23:07] <ActionParsnip> bianca: i have buddies with decent nvidia cards with the same output
[23:07] <k1l_> and who is giving it?
[23:07] <bianca> are you kidding me?
[23:07] <ActionParsnip> bianca: try installing super tux cart, or something like that
[23:07] <Ben64> bianca: dude. chill out
[23:08] <bianca> sick of repeating myself
[23:08] <ephesius> its a public channel people come and go
[23:08] <MondayMondayMond> bianca:  way to speak to a bunch of people volunteering their time
[23:08] <ActionParsnip> bianca: again, have you ried super tux cart (or similar)
[23:08] <dr_willis> it pays to be verbose on IRC -  messages can appear out of order. and people constantly get disconnected/reconnected
[23:09] <k1l_> bianca: i think you should try to make a support thead in the ubuntuforums. i dont think that is gonna take a good end here on irc :/
[23:09] <bianca> well you were here every time someone asked me
[23:10] <bianca> and people ask then say nothing
[23:10] <vitimiti> hi
[23:10] <bianca> peoand yous kepe making meput  all this stuff in terminal but ive got nowehere
[23:10] <ActionParsnip> bianca: do other 3D games run ok?
[23:10] <bianca> wait i have to download something
[23:11] <k1l_> bianca: we dont know what you did and what is actually going on there. so we need to ask to get a clue
[23:11] <Xen> I am wondering about software raid setup on ubuntu 12.04 LTS, I have a raid failure and in messing around I screwed something up.  I am wondering about how it should be setup.  I have a large partition and small one on each disk (swap section and data sections) and I am wondering, how they should be combined in raid.  ie: small with small, or large with small and vice versa)
[23:11] <vitimiti> I have this message when logging in my system, and I'd like to know if it's a big deal or if there's any solution, since i can't seem to finde anything about this http://pastebin.com/L8xnCTvz thanks beforehand
[23:11] <k1l_> bianca: i really recommend you to use the forums for support, since you dont seem to like the way irc works.
[23:11] <dr_willis> Hmm. Dont usb3 hds have smart info? noticed thats greyed out in the disk manager tool for my new USB3 3TB hd..
[23:12] <bianca> kick me then

[23:12] <bianca> stop repeating yourself
[23:12] <ActionParsnip> bianca: cool, let me know how you go
[23:13] <Ben64> dr_willis: they do have smart info, but not everything can see it from usb
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> bianca: you never replied to me
[23:13] <bianca> i did
[23:13] <bianca> all 3 times
[23:13] <ActionParsnip> vitimiti: are you using an Asus K73TA?
[23:13] <ephesius> bianca: if you had responded and told him you were trying it he wouldn't have asked over and over
[23:13] <dr_willis> Ben64:   that may be why i thought i saw it on other usb hds.. got a new HD.. wanting to sort of test it out.. its a bit noisy and clcks when i first power it up. but from what reviews ive seen.. its just a loud noisy drive.
[23:13] <vitimiti> ActionParsnip, an ASUS-K53U
[23:14] <dr_willis> Ben64:  getting these days where i dont trust HDs very much. ;)

[23:14] <vitimiti> ActionParsnip, thanks, let me check it :)
[23:15] <Ben64> bianca: because you don't seem to know how to respond to people without an attitude
[23:15] <bianca> = hours of getting nowhere
[23:15] <MondayMondayMond> bianca: somebody has a case of the mondays
[23:15] <dr_willis> thats what often happens with cutting edge hardware. - linux support/drivers have not caught up with the hw quirks.
[23:15] <Ben64> bianca: i looked back about 40 minutes, and most of it is you complaining. if you put the same effort into trying to solve the problem, maybe you'd be done by now
[23:16] <heywood> planning to enable openssh-server on my home server running 12.04.1 LTS. the box sits behind a firewall router running NAT. root is disabled (as per ubuntu default); one user account that is listed in sudoers.
[23:16] <ActionParsnip> bianca: are there bugs reported?
[23:16] <bianca> in windows, i could have literally just moved the files i need to the right place, you cant do that in linux :)
[23:16] <heywood> question is, is it considered best practice to make a separate account, with a super-strong password, for access from the outside?
[23:16] <bianca> i havent finnished downloading yet, my internet is slow
[23:17] <Ben64> heywood: you should have a good password anyway, but you can use your normal account
[23:17] <ActionParsnip> bianca: gksudo nautilus $HOME    you can put any file anywhere
[23:17] <bianca> it didnt work it said i havent set permissions for nautalis
[23:17] <bianca> like i said like an hour ago
[23:17] <Ben64> yes, because we all saw what you wrote an hour ago :|
[23:18] <heywood> Ben64: existing password is pretty strong (mixed case, punctuation, numbers) but i'm paranoid about it not being strong enough when the box is exposed to the intarwebs.
[23:18] <Dice-Man> hello people
[23:18] <ActionParsnip> bianca: then run:  sudo -i   and you can cp the files where you want
[23:18] <Ben64> heywood: it would be a good idea to change the ssh port. lots of bots run scans on port 22
[23:18] <heywood> Ben64: perhaps i should just change my existing password to the very long one?
[23:18] <Dice-Man> how to configure my keyboard please ?
[23:19] <Ben64> heywood: put on fail2ban, combined with your already good password, and you should be fine
[23:19] <bianca> Error moving file: Permission denied
[23:19] <bianca> i need to merge folders
[23:19] <heywood> Ben64: thought about that too. router can do port forwarding, so i could forward a random high-numbered port (WAN) to 192.168.xx.yy:22 (LAN), specifying the machine running sshd. would that plus fail2ban be sufficient?
[23:20] <ActionParsnip> Dice-Man: what make and model keyboard please?
[23:20] <bianca> omfg its my os why the hell cant i do what i want?
[23:20] <Ben64> heywood: yeah, it'd take billions of combinations to figure out your password, and fail2ban doesn't give them that many tries :)
[23:20] <k1l_> bianca: what are you trying to copy from where to where?
[23:20] <bianca> om, the repeating myself thing again
[23:20] <k1l_> bianca: stop that!
[23:21] <bencc> what is precise-backports repo?
[23:21] <Ben64> bianca: if you haven't said it in the past 5 minutes it didn't happen
[23:21] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: i guess the chmod would be 777
[23:21] <k1l_> bianca: answer the easy questions or leave the support channel if you dont want to recieve help
[23:21] <heywood> Ben64: ok, thanks. out of curiosity, is there a way to assign a (very long) password to an account when accessed via ssh, and a regular one when accessed at the console? would that even make sense?
[23:21] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: Yeah
[23:21] <heywood> (sorry -- very much a noob at security. just paranoid, maybe.)
[23:21] <bianca> im trying to merge a usr an ect folde ron my desktop with thoughs in my /
[23:21] <Ben64> heywood: well..... you could disable passwords and use keys instead, even more secure
[23:22] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: i thought you asked what the number equivilant would be
[23:22] <heywood> Ben64: is there a tutorial for that somewhere?
[23:22] <Ben64> heywood: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys
[23:22] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: Yeah, I looked it up
[23:22] <heywood> Ben64: specifically, i'm not sure how that would work for access from the machine's keyboard directly (i.e. physical access)
[23:23] <SonikkuAmerica> dingo311: But I don't know about that NVIDIA audio chip.
[23:23] <Ben64> heywood: well password would still work locally, just over ssh you'd need the key
[23:23] <bianca> but you cant do that in linux because it has a babyproofed commandline
[23:23] <MondayMondayMond> bianca: sudo..
[23:23] <bianca> i did sudo
[23:23] <bianca> you still cant
[23:24] <SonikkuAmerica> bianca: [ sudo -i ] first before the command maybe?
[23:24] <bianca> because the move command cont comprehend or wrap its head around the idea of the folder already exsisting in the destination, and having files in it already?! outragious
[23:24] <k1l_> bianca: can you show the command you used?
[23:24] <heywood> Ben64: ah, OK, that would be perfect. i'm fine creating a key for remote access (which i will probably only ever do from my one and only laptop). local login w/ existing PW would be just fine.
[23:24] <bianca> and apparently theres no merge command.. sooo.. its impossible to merge folders in linux
[23:25] <dingo311> SonikkuAmerica: me either, didnt have this issue on desktop version ever...maybe not related but ssh keys dont seem to be working and earlir today i could not access anything but everything was running. a reboot fixed that, but then i realised i needed sudo for alsa again
[23:25] <bianca> no i cannot
[23:25] <nathan_> is there anyway i can setup ssh server so that whereever it is in the world i can connect to it WITHOUT having to modify (open port 22 ) on the router??
[23:25] <geoff__> I am stuck in here and can't get out - what command should I use - thanks heaps
[23:25] <overdub> bianca, rsync can merge directories
[23:25] <k1l_> bianca: last time: stop that ranting. that is not gonna help you anyway and just making users forget your real problem!
[23:25] <ActionParsnip> bianca: if you run ath amd catalyst control centre, do you get any errors etc?
[23:25] <overdub> or at least sync one directory to another
[23:26] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: you need to open the port on the router, or the connection will be dropped
[23:26] <k1l_> geoff__: want to leave the irc? or just change to another channel?
[23:26] <bianca> no?
[23:26] <heywood> bianca: you could try cp -i. that would effectively allow you to merge two directories without overwriting (or with selective overwriting). of course that would take a long time if you have many files.
[23:26] <geoff__> leave channel
[23:26] <k1l_> geoff__: /part
[23:26] <ActionParsnip> bianca: does it show the driver in use and so forth?
[23:26] <geoff__> thanks kil
[23:27] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: its the nature of NAT which all router use
[23:27] <bianca> i forgot the move command, and i want to overweight
[23:27] <ActionParsnip> bianca: mv  is the move command
[23:27] <overdub> oh my bad, don't want to overwrite existing files, rsync might not work for you then
[23:27] <bianca> yes
[23:27] <heywood> bianca: mv -f will force overwrite. add a sudo if you have permissions issues.
[23:27] <bianca> clock = 1250 :3
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> bianca: but the driver is in use and so forth
[23:28] <k1l_> ActionParsnip: playonlinux and some other game was the inital problem, irrc
[23:28] <heywood> Ben64: anyway, thanks for the link. i think i'll change the password to something even longer anyway, and stick to key-based access for 99% of the time.
[23:28] <ActionParsnip> bianca: maybe its steam being wierd then , if open gams run ok then its a wine issue (check appdb for compatibility)
[23:29] <bianca> root@raven-pc:~# mv -f '/home/raven/Desktop/usr' '/home/raven/Desktop/etc' '/'
[23:29] <bianca> mv: cannot move `/home/raven/Desktop/usr' to `/usr': Directory not empty
[23:29] <bianca> mv: cannot move `/home/raven/Desktop/etc' to `/etc': Directory not empty
[23:29] <Ben64> why are you trying to overwrite stuff in /usr and /etc anyway
[23:30] <heywood> Ben64: heck, i can always do admin stuff locally from the laptop even if i'm sitting next to the machine. easier than having to type the very long PW over and over again (i have the screen set to lock after only a few minutes)
[23:30] <bianca> it has fine compatibility
[23:30] <ActionParsnip> bianca: you will need to copy the files from within those folders to the folders themselves if you cannot find a merge command
[23:30] <bianca> what...
[23:30] <heywood> bianca: mv -f /home/raven/Desktop/usr/* /usr/* maybe?
[23:31] <dr_willis> or use the 'mc' file manager as root. ;) thats what i normally do for cli needs
[23:31] <heywood> bianca: but that really will overwrite stuff in /usr ... as others have noted, that might be a bit risky.
[23:31] <bianca> well it didnt work
[23:31] <bianca> directory is not empty
[23:31] <heywood> bianca: oops... i meant mv -f /home/raven/Desktop/usr/* /usr/ maybe?
[23:31] <bianca> it blows my mind how stupid this is
[23:31] <ActionParsnip> bianca: if you cannot copy them as you tried, then go into each folder and copy the files in the subfolders individually
[23:31] <themill> .o0( mv isn't stupid )
[23:32] <ActionParsnip> bianca: why are you manually copying stuff to /usr and /etc?
[23:32] <bianca> still same thing, directory isnt empty
[23:32] <Ben64> mkdir /home/raven/Desktop/tobemerged; mv /home/raven/Desktop/usr /home/raven/Desktop/etc /home/raven/Desktop/tobemerged/; sudo rsync -avP /home/raven/Desktop/tobemerged/* /
[23:32] <Ben64> type that, break your system, i don't care
[23:32] <bianca> cause when i googled the issue it gave me the files im missing
[23:33] <heywood> bianca: if it's the files inside /home/raven/Desktop/usr/ that you want to move, then that should work just fine. you're probably getting that error due to trying to move directories inside .../Desktop/usr/ onto identically-named directories inside /usr/
[23:33] <ActionParsnip> bianca: can you pastebin the output of:   find ~/Desktop      Thanks
[23:33] <heywood> Ben64: your shell-fu is strong. :)
[23:34] <lbj_90> My mouse is locking up after clicking one of the side buttons and I remember there's a way to get a readout of mouse position and clicks but I don't remember how to get to it. Anybody know? I thought it was dmesg but I want a live readout
[23:34] <bianca> LOL.. that made a folder called tobemerged and its not doing anything..
[23:34] <Ben64> heywood: its not very fancy
[23:34] <Ben64> bianca: you probably didn't type it correctly
[23:34] <bianca> i copyed it
[23:34] <heywood> no, but better than my ham-handed suggestion. i always have to look at the manpage for rsync on the rare occasion i need to use it.
[23:36] <bianca> hmm i think it worked
[23:36] <dr_willis> lbj_90:  the xev command perhaps
[23:36] <tripelb> i want to ruen 4 partitions into 2 and resize does not like a zero size. what's to do?
[23:36] <bianca> is it meant to delete the origonal or not?
[23:36] <Ben64> no
[23:36] <lbj_90> that's what's up tripleb, thanks!!
[23:36] <dr_willis> tripelb:  you plan on keeping the data intact?
[23:37] <bianca> brb
[23:37] <heywood> Ben64: do i understand correctly that the bit at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring#disable-password-authentication applies only to passwords used for ssh login attempts, and that it doesn't apply to local logins?
[23:37] <tripelb> and i forgot the teeminal command to list the partitions so i only have the gui. help help did not help.
[23:37] <Ben64> heywood: yep
[23:37] <dr_willis> heywood:  you can set up keys for ssh where theres no need for a password..
[23:38] <Ben64> tripelb: sudo fdisk -l
[23:38] <heywood> IOW, if i disable PW auth as described, i'll need keys for ssh, but my local login still works as before.
[23:38] <lbj_90> dr_willis: thanks to you, read the wrong name at first...thanks!
[23:38] <dr_willis> tripelb:  sudo blkid or    cfdisk -l or fdisk -l
[23:38] <dr_willis> heywood:  it does not affect local login at all.
[23:38] <heywood> dr_willis: right. i think that's what i want to do. (long pre-stored key for ssh from my laptop, regular PW for login at the server's keyboard)
[23:38] <Ben64> tripelb: and if you want to remove 2 partitions, you need to remove them, not resize them to zero
[23:39] <dr_willis> heywood:  simple way is to use the 'ssh-copy-id' command to copy keys around. then you can use keys., or password
[23:39] <dr_willis> once you get it working without passwd. you can disable the passwd auth
[23:39] <Ben64> i love ssh keys, lets me log into my server, my raspberry pi, my desktop, my laptop without ever having to type a password
[23:40] <Ben64> from my phone, or from any of the aforementioned devices
=== IboS_ is now known as IboS
[23:40] <heywood> dr_willis: ok, seems like a bit of a chicken-and-egg thing, but relatively low-risk if i only do it the one time (and then disable PW once the ssh-copy-id stuff is set up. correct?
[23:40] <dingo311> Ben64: then maybe you can help me with ssh keys. i copy the key into authorized_keys but still have to put in a password
[23:41] <Troy^> How does one get plank dock to start at boot?
[23:41] <heywood> in theory, a (single) PW-based ssh login should not be sniffable so as to reveal the PW.
[23:41] <Sgt_Shultz> & allow someone 2 scan u as u walk past ....
[23:41] <dr_willis> heywood:  or you copy the files over via a flash drive.. but copy-id is easier
[23:41] <Ben64> dingo311: you might need to restart the ssh server
[23:41] <ActionParsnip> Troy^: add the item to the startup items
[23:42] <heywood> dr_willis: understood. unfortunately my laptop and i are several thousand km away from the server at the moment. :o
[23:42] <dr_willis> Troy^:  whats 'plank dock' ? theres the ~/.config/autostart/ directory
[23:42] <dr_willis> heywood:  id keep password auth enabled then.. just in case the keys get messed up ;)
[23:42] <dingo311> Ben64: i use sudo service ssh restart
[23:43] <heywood> dr_willis: ok. but i should be safe disabling once i can verify that the key-based ssh login works, right?
[23:43] <heywood> ... disabling PW auth, that is.
[23:43] <dr_willis> heywood:  should be.. but often i have issues with testing out a new client on my phone with getting the keys working. so its nice to have passwd to fallback on
[23:44] <ActionParsnip> Troy^: there is a 'startup apps' item in dash, run plank at boot
[23:44] <heywood> dr_willis: ok. maybe i'll just change the PW to something very very long as an intermediate step (in addition to setting up the ssh keys).
[23:44] <Ben64> dingo311: you need the key from the id_rsa.pub on the client in the authorized_keys on the server
[23:44] <Troy^> Ok, i found that, But I really don't know where plank resides.
[23:44] <Ben64> Troy^: type "which plank"
[23:44] <ActionParsnip> Troy^: run:    which plank    and it will tell you
[23:44] <heywood> maybe i'm being too paranoid, but i feel like i need to be (much) more cautious as soon as i expose the machine to the open internet.
[23:45] <dr_willis> heywood:  got a tinfoil hat to go with the paranoia also? ;)
[23:45] <Troy^> ActionParsnip and Ben64 thanks
[23:45] <dr_willis> heywood:  check out fail2ban and logwatch also to keep an eye on it
[23:45] <Vivekananda> hello everyone : A very simple question about xchat in ubuntu lucid. I type /msg or /MSG nickname hello and it does NOt open a new window and shows the hello sent to the nick but on the main channel page itself shows --- >nickname<| hello
[23:45] <heywood> dr_willis: thin titanium. much more stylish and durable.
[23:45] <Vivekananda> whi si this
[23:45] <heywood> i think everyone will be wearing them in a few years.
[23:45] <Ben64> Vivekananda: use /query
[23:45] <dr_willis> Vivekananda:  most likely an xchat setting. check its docs?
[23:45] <frijol> hola
[23:46] <lbj_90> xev doesn't display anything when I click the button that freezes up my mouse. any other recommendations?
[23:46] <k1l_> Vivekananda: single /msgs are sent as a single message and dont open a query
[23:46] <nathan_> is there anyway i can setup ssh server so that whereever it is in the world i can connect to it WITHOUT having to modify (open port 22 ) on the router??
[23:46] <Vivekananda> Ben64: pardon my ignorance but how do I use /query ? can someone point me to it.
[23:46] <dingo311> Ben64: this is on my phone. i generate a key, copy it, paste into ~.ssh/authorized_keys and restart
[23:46] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: no, its not possible. you must open port 22/tcp on the router
[23:46] <Ben64> Vivekananda: same way as /msg
[23:47] <nathan_> serious Actionparsnip
[23:47] <dr_willis> router has to know where to send the request. ;)
[23:47] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: yes
[23:47] <Vivekananda> k1l_: how do I send a window message ?? as Ben64 says /query
[23:47] <Vivekananda> hmm
[23:47] <heywood> nathan_: do you know if your router can do port forwarding?
[23:47] <nathan_> what about a tunnel...( still dont know/ understand how to yet)
[23:47] <dr_willis> tunnle would still need ssh access/port forwarding
[23:48] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: like dr_willis says, you need to tell the router where to push the connection as well as allow asynchronous traffic in, the nature of routers gives a firwall by it dropping unsolicited connection attempts, unless you make a rule
[23:48] <nathan_> well thats not the problem actually...if the router can port forward the thing is i wont have access to the various routers settings
[23:48] <k1l_> Vivekananda: did you acutally try "/query nickname"?
[23:48] <usr13> nathan_: The process would be to forward port 22 to an inside IP, (which would need to be a static lease, or static IP).
[23:49] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: if you want an SSH tunnel, you still need a connection to the system from the outside
[23:49] <nathan_> cant ssh listen on another port? a higher level port?
[23:49] <Vivekananda> I tried /QUERY BEN hello and it just opened a new window but I dont see my "hello" anywhere on it :(
[23:49] <nathan_> or on port 80?
[23:50] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: you can tweak the port if you wish, it allows you to connect to multiple SSH servers
=== vibhav is now known as Guest95839
[23:50] <Ben64> Vivekananda: well after the window is opened you could use /msg
[23:50] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: your router may be able to push connections to different port numbers, most home grade routers use the same port number for the forward as they connect on
[23:51] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: you can change the port number in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[23:51] <ActionParsnip> nathan_: changing the port number will not give any security
[23:52] <nathan_> Actionparsnip ?? i thought ssh worked on encryption.. how is it not secure than.??
[23:52] <nathan_> how does changing the port make it less secure
[23:52] <XMLnewbi> anyone got some time to help me set up Vhosts on my ubuntu 12.04 server? ive been crunching at this a couple days and still cant get more the one domain on my VPS
[23:53] <nathan_> anyway thanks for your help ima google it further
[23:53] <nathan_> exit
[23:53] <nathan_> exit
[23:53] <FloodBot1> nathan_: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[23:54] <heywood> nathan_: if your router can do port forwarding, you could forward some random high-numbered port on the WAN (internet-facing) side to port 22 on the LAN (local network) side. i think you could also restrict it to a specific IP on the LAN side as well.
[23:54] <tripelb> ben64 ah i was going by the askubuntu page. i'll be bac in a sec. gonna switch to see the page on nexus7. now on phone which will become hotspot. is this ghetto tech or a fresh way if doing things, she jokes.
[23:55] <XMLnewbi> I can see why people pay for cpanel now
[23:55] <Ben64> ew, cpanel
[23:55] <Ben64> i wouldn't use it if it was free
[23:56] <merlini_xu> When i update my ubuntu ,It will report this message "Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)".anyone can help me.
[23:57] <XMLnewbi> do you use any control panel?      can you point me to a good Vhosts command line tutorial. Ive tried a bunch and no luck yet
[23:57] <Ben64> no, i just use a command line :)
[23:58] <dingo311> guys, why wont my permissions for alsamixer stick after a reboot? i have to use sudo to run it. this is on server 12. never had this issue with the desktop distro
[23:59] <Vivekananda> Ben64: Do you mean that I should type /query Ben64 and then /msg Ben64 Hello to show the hello ?
[23:59] <Ben64> Vivekananda: yeah
[23:59] <cmdr> hello
