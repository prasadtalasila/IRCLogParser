[04:38] <roasted> hello
[04:38] <roasted> fired up my r-pi with openelec tonight
[04:38] <roasted> worked wonderfully
[04:38] <roasted> once I get my hdds in for my server Ill host videos there and auto mount the smb share on the r-pi... stream over the network. pro.
[06:08] <InHisName> I want to set an evironment variable BEFORE invoking python.  How to do that ?    gksu python script.py
[10:36] <rmg51> Morning
[12:43] <waltman> Morning.
[12:50] <JonathanD> hi waltman
[12:54] <waltman> yo
[14:08] <InHisName> Hey anyone pay attention to my 1am question?   Oh, yes, Good Morning !
[14:26] <waltman> InHisName: VAR=value python script.py
[14:27] <waltman> That works for any command, e.g. TZ=Europe/Helsinki date
[14:29] <InHisName> But, waltman, when I click the Icon on desktop with the command from 1am comment, the path is not there, it fails.  Need a way to inject the path before starting the command.    ---> gksu python script.py
[14:30] <waltman> what's gsku?
[14:30] <InHisName> Would   VAR=value  gksu python script.py work ?
[14:30] <waltman> probably, depending on what gksu is
[14:30] <waltman> ah
[14:31] <InHisName> I'll try that then.
[14:31] <waltman> you could also try putting it after gksu. With sudo it works either way.
[14:33] <InHisName> Nope,  adding that into the front of command does NOT work.  Program does not start anymore.
[14:33] <InHisName> OK, I'll try that, then.
[14:35] <InHisName> Nope, just prompt for su password, then nada !
[14:35] <InHisName> Where can I put it during bootup.  THAT should do it just grand.
[14:35] <InHisName> ubuntu 12.10
[14:36] <InHisName> It was put into .bashrc but no good either.   can't find an "rc" file for python.
[14:38] <waltman> can you modify the environment variable inside the script?

[15:07] <InHisName> The R5 is a coal train???
[15:08] <InHisName> Did you really get to help shovel ?
[15:09] <InHisName> I tried using -->os.environ['VARIB']="stuf"  but that aparently wasn't good enough to work.
[15:10] <waltman> OK, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit...
[15:10] <InHisName> Best that I set it during boot.  What script always runs that I can add an export environment var to it ?
[15:11] <waltman> That is, in fact, the same train line, but from like 100 years ago.
