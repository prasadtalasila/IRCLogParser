[03:15] <TheLordOfTime> is there a maximum bit strength for ssh keys that launchpad accepts?
[03:15]  * TheLordOfTime has to upload a new system's ssh keys to there, and is trying to ascertain the maximum strength he can make the key to
[03:16] <StevenK> That's up to the keyserver, since LP will just pull from it.
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> StevenK:  that's PGP keys
[03:16] <StevenK> 4096R still seems like the best choice
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> i was asking about SSH key.
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> or do they end up in the same place?
[03:16] <StevenK> TheLordOfTime: True. I should learn to read at some point.
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[03:17] <TheLordOfTime> i *never* make PGP keys with less bitstrength than 4096
[03:17] <TheLordOfTime> i'm a tad overkill with my SSH key bit strengths though...
[03:17]  * TheLordOfTime has previously created 8192-bit-strength keys, but only as a proof that strong keys can be made on legacy systems
[03:18] <TheLordOfTime> s/keys/ssh keys/
[03:18] <StevenK> sshkey.keytext is type text, which unlimited
[03:18] <StevenK> So it depends on what twisted will support, I guess
[03:22] <TheLordOfTime> well i was able to upload the overkill-strength key...
[03:26] <TheLordOfTime> question: any way to confirm that its using the key?
[03:27] <hyperair> ssh -vvv
[03:27] <StevenK> sftp bazaar.launchpad.net ?
[03:27] <hyperair> it took a rather interestingly long time to generate a 16384 bit key. heheh.
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> ssh -vvv to bazaar.launchpad.net with my lp username showed its using the right key :P
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> hyperair:  i can't seem to generate a 16384, perhaps NotEnoughRAM?
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> or NotEnoughCPU?
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> regardless, 8192's in the range of 'overkill' anyways
[03:29] <hyperair> yes it is
[03:29] <hyperair> heheh
[03:29] <hyperair> TheLordOfTime: what happens when you try to generate a 16384 one?
[03:30] <TheLordOfTime> hyperair:  i don't do commandline generation - seahorse is the tool i use for fast-create
[03:30] <hyperair> ah.
[03:30] <TheLordOfTime> hyperair:  give me the command line option, after my 4096R PGP key is done generating, i'll tell you :P
[03:30] <hyperair> maybe seahorse just doesn't know it's possible.
[03:30] <hyperair> ssh-keygen -b 16384 -f /path/to/key_file
[03:30] <TheLordOfTime> holy crap all my CPU is eaten by PGP primegen o.O
[03:31] <hyperair> i don't recall 4096R taking much time to generate...
[03:31] <hyperair> what CPU are you running on?
[03:31] <TheLordOfTime> 4 year old machine
[03:31] <TheLordOfTime> that about sum it up?
[03:31] <TheLordOfTime> :/
[03:32] <hyperair> core 2 duo?
[03:32] <hyperair> i generated my 4096 key on a 4 year old laptop
[03:32] <hyperair> it was pretty quick
[03:32] <StevenK> I was about to ask
[03:32] <StevenK> Conroe, at a guess?
[03:32] <StevenK> Wolfdale, perhaps. My last desktop was a Wolfdale
[03:33]  * hyperair shrugs. no idea what mine was
[03:33] <TheLordOfTime> its done generating, i think mine was a core 2 duo
[03:33] <TheLordOfTime> but this is a laptop so...
[03:33]  * TheLordOfTime shrugs
[03:33] <hyperair> Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     T5750  @ 2.00GHz
[03:33] <hyperair> so says /proc/cpuinfo
[03:34] <StevenK> ARK maps that to Merom
[03:34] <hyperair> TheLordOfTime: mine was a laptop too.
[03:34] <TheLordOfTime> Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     T9550  @ 2.66GHz
[03:35] <StevenK> Merom was the first mobile Core, so same as Conroe
[03:35] <TheLordOfTime> hyperair:  i don't think seahorse is configured to use anything greater than 8192
[03:35] <TheLordOfTime> because anything beyond that is liek "WTFH ARE YOU DOING?"
[03:35] <TheLordOfTime> normal SSH users won't need such strong keys
[03:35] <StevenK> T9550 is Penryn, the successor to Merom
[03:35]  * TheLordOfTime is generating a 16384 anyways
[03:36] <TheLordOfTime> :O
[03:36] <TheLordOfTime> IT FINISHED
[03:45] <TheLordOfTime> hyperair:  the 16384 is now my LP key :P
[03:45]  * TheLordOfTime is twistedly oversecure with his systems :P
[03:55] <hyperair> TheLordOfTime: haha nice.
[03:55] <hyperair> TheLordOfTime: now just wait for the quantum computer to come along and blow all your keys away. ;-)
[04:47] <TheLordOfTime> once that comes along, i'll  bring it to its knees making make a 99999999999999-bite-strength key :P
[04:47] <TheLordOfTime> byte*
[04:47] <TheLordOfTime> hyperair:  ^
[04:48] <hyperair> heh
[04:48] <StevenK> Which will have no bearing on how long a quantum computer will take to factor it
[04:48] <TheLordOfTime> StevenK:  :P
