[13:13] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1103195 in maas (Ubuntu) "MAAS WebUI crashes when installing maas-region-controller only" [Medium,Confirmed]
[14:33] <roaksoax> rvba: the bug above is from latest lp:maas/1.2 (which is on raring). Happened after a clean install
=== matsubara is now known as matsubara-lunch
[16:04] <roaksoax> rvba: so a better quick fix would be to install the tool with maas-region-contorller then?
[16:05] <rvba> roaksoax: not sure it's better, but it's quicker :)
[16:05] <roaksoax> indeed :)
[16:25] <roaksoax> rvba: btw.. wanted to check with you if this makes sense to you: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1563502/
[16:25] <roaksoax> this is adding an 'xinstall' purpose that installs Ubuntu using a fast path installer (using the pehemral image)
[16:35] <roaksoax> rvba: and.. in a preseed, what variable refers to the cluster controller from which a node is booting from?
=== matsubara-lunch is now known as matsubara
[17:29] <rvba> roaksoax: having a look nowâ€¦
[17:32] <rvba> roaksoax: looks good but: I wonder why you need the symlink stuff since importing the same image twice is simpler right now / not sure if using the tags to decide install/xinstall is the way to go in the long run (but looks ok for testing at least)
[17:34] <rvba> roaksoax: I don't think that variable is present yet.
[17:51] <roaksoax> rvba: the tags stuff is being tested already :)
[17:52] <roaksoax> rvba: the symlink stuff might eventually change since the image will be obtained from oxygen and XYZ
[17:52] <roaksoax> and yes the variable to refer to cluster controller is what is needed
