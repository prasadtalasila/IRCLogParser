[00:01] <waltman> Classmate: "Are you around tomorrow after 1:30?" Me: "Sure, I'll be around all day." So he stops by at 5.
[00:01] <waltman> Am I wrong for getting a little annoyed at that?
[00:03] <waltman> he showed up 5 minutes before all hell broke loose with that power strip
[00:09] <pleia2> sounds like he pissed off the power strip too
[00:09] <pleia2> I vote blaming that guy
[00:10] <jedijf> so to avoid that guy you set the lab on fire...damn waltman
[00:12] <waltman> how about if I add that he smelled like he's smoked a pack of cigarettes on his way over?
[00:16] <ChinnoDog> I've run everything from one outlet before. I use an A/C cord and an outlet multiplier block without a cord to reduce the fire hazard though.
[10:29] <rmg51> Morning
[13:04] <teddy-dbear> Morning peoples
[14:04]  * ChinnoDog yawns
[14:23] <MutantTurkish> I love when they let you pick the security question
[14:23] <MutantTurkish> brings up the old XKCD where are the bodies found one
[14:24] <MutantTurkish> I hate arbitrary password restrictions though,... they suck
[14:29] <jedijf> i hate the timeouts
[14:29] <jedijf> forced changing dates
[14:29] <JonathanD> "your password is too long"
[14:29] <jedijf> i hate that my bank doesn't allow 'special' characters
[14:31] <MutantTurkish> your password is to similar to your old one...
[14:31] <MutantTurkish> then I _always_ forget it
[14:31] <jedijf> MutantTurkish: but i think in your new role, you are supposed to love all things passwords
[14:32] <MutantTurkish> hell I don't know  my online bnking password and it's so annoying I just stopped using it.
[14:32] <MutantTurkish> get my balances in the mail.
[14:32] <MutantTurkish> jedijf: I like _sane_ passwords
[14:32] <jedijf> as a sysadmin 1234 is no longer allowed
[14:33] <jedijf> pass, however is still acceptable
[14:34] <JonathanD> hunter2
[14:51] <MutantTurkish> lol
[14:51] <MutantTurkish> i have o rest my domain registar password every single time.
[14:57] <MutantTurkish> Anyone know of a good way to know my home IP if it's dynamic, while away?
[14:57] <MutantTurkish> if my home server computer is on, i'd love to ssh into it, yet  I can't because i dn't always have the IP
[14:57] <MutantTurkish> esp i f it changes
[16:11] <jedijf> mut	dynamic dns
[17:43] <ChinnoDog> What happened to the "ey" in Turkey?
[17:58] <ChinnoDog> ey, MutantTurkish?
[17:58] <MutantTurkish> not on my desktop
[17:58] <MutantTurkish> don't feel like authin'
[17:58] <MutantTurkish> :[ why you CTCPin me
[17:59] <ChinnoDog> To see why auth is so much work for you.
[17:59] <ChinnoDog> Be lazy like the rest of us and use a CLI based client
[18:01] <MutantTurkish> Im just using pidgin since I don't have konversation installed.
[18:40] <ChinnoDog> The longer I look through amber lenses the less amber everything looks
[18:40] <TheLordOfTime> lol
[18:41] <ChinnoDog> But then when I take them off everything has a blue tint to it.
[18:45] <TheLordOfTime> your eyes autoadapt like that
[18:45] <TheLordOfTime> or rather your brain does :P
[18:46] <ChinnoDog> Box from Newegg just arrived
[18:48]  * ChinnoDog oohs and ahhs new video card
[18:48] <TheLordOfTime> watch it be DoA :P
[18:49] <ChinnoDog> It better not be :-p
[18:53] <ChinnoDog> Admittedly it is for a Windows server so I can use RemoteFX. I'm not sure how that will integrate with the Ubuntu VM
[19:12] <ChinnoDog> There are three choices I can see for getting 3D acceleration from the VM. 1. Use a virtual GPU in the VM + VirtualGLl. I am not sure either one of those will work in this configuration. 2. Run xming on the Windows server and access ubuntu through an RDP session. This is the most reliable method but the UI will be double remoted. 3. Run xming on my laptop. I won't get the benefit of the new graphics
[19:12] <ChinnoDog> card in the server this way but it will work and 2D will be fast.
[20:22] <MutantTurkish1> if you don't have ifconfig what do you use?
[20:22] <MutantTurkish1> wait nvm
[20:28] <MutantTurkish1> just dumb
[20:39] <ChinnoDog> common affliction
[21:12] <jedijf> MutantTurkish1: you /should/ be using ip now
[21:13] <ChinnoDog> ip > ifconfig?
[21:16] <jedijf> newer - the new style - stay current - i try to when i remember even though still prep ifconfig
[21:16] <jedijf> prefer
[21:18] <jedijf> even though the whole aptitude > apt-get thing still has me pissed
[21:18] <jedijf> after i got used to, and totally switched, they said 'psych'
[21:28] <waltman> I confess I'm still using aptitude
[21:28] <waltman> just to spite them!
[21:33] <Samuraialba> Good bacon to all and to all some good bacon!
[21:35] <ChinnoDog> With so much replacement functionality in any Linux distro it would be nice if old commands would notify you they are depreciated
[23:45] <roasted> I am about to enjoy one of the most amazing songs ever produced
[23:45] <roasted> Pink Floyd - Comfortably Numb - Live - Pulse - London 1994
