[17:03] <Brian_H> hey all... anyone have a recommendation for a quality wifi router thats reliable (as far as wifi goes)?
[22:12] <bkerensa> Brian_H: Linksys EA6500 (I think it has 8 internal radios) or Belkin N900 DB Advanced (6-8 radios)
[22:13] <bkerensa> Brian_H: N900 DB Advanced has energy saving mode so if there are hours you know your not every using it can shut off
[22:13] <bkerensa> both routers allow cloud storage too
[22:14] <Brian_H> lol nice thanks :)
[22:50] <Brian_H> bkerensa: have you tested either of those? which do you have the best luck for set it and forget it type environments?
[22:50] <Brian_H> something as close to a real appliance as possible would be nice
[22:50] <bkerensa> I have tested both and enjoyed both
[22:50] <bkerensa> had no issues with either
[22:51] <Brian_H> ok cool :) I appreciate the response
[22:51] <bkerensa> The EA6500 has a android app so you can access your router anywhere
[22:51] <bkerensa> :D
[23:23] <bkerensa> Brian_H: btw new site looks nice
[23:23] <Brian_H> thanks :)
