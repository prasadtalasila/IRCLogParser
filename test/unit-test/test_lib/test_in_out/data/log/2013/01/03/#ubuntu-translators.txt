[15:19] <dpm> hi kelemengabor, I'm not sure I'll be able to make it on time to the translations IRC meeting, but I'll be on the channel. I'll do my best, though
[15:21] <kelemengabor> oh no... I have not prepared much as to what to say to people :\
[15:23] <dpm> kelemengabor, sorry, the phone has taken quite a lot of my time lately. However, I see you've got quite a good set of agenda items on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Meetings/Next, so I think it should be good
[18:02] <kelemengabor> sooo... it's 7PM, time to start the meeting, I guess
[18:02] <kelemengabor> who is here for it? :)
[18:02] <cqfd93> me
[18:03] <Gwaihir> kelemengabor, I'm half-around... still working
[18:03] <teolemon> hey
[18:03] <cqfd93> (Sylvie Gallet) French translator
[18:03] <teolemon> (Pierre Slamich) French translator
[18:03] <kelemengabor> ping askhl bulldog98 dpm greyback Guest43293 hito_jp Mirv RawChid sale sipherdee trijntje ypwong
[18:03] <kelemengabor> hi Sylvie, Milo, Pierre :)
[18:04] <cqfd93> hi all!
[18:04] <kelemengabor> I hope I remember correctly that Gwaihir is Milo Casagrande :D
[18:04] <Gwaihir> kelemengabor, indeed :-)
[18:05] <kelemengabor> okay, so the agenda is here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/Meetings/Next
[18:05] <dpm> hey all, I mentioned it to kelemengabor already. Unfortunately something else has come up, so while I'll be on the channel, I might not be too responsive
[18:05] <dpm> thanks everyone for coming up
[18:06] <kelemengabor> hey dpm
[18:06] <dpm> hey kelemengabor, thanks again for setting everything up
[18:06] <kelemengabor> then I guess it will be my task to speak first :)
[18:07] <kelemengabor> As you might know, David was diverted inside Canonical for other tasks, which means we will have a lot more to do on our own, if we want to deliver a well localized Ubuntu Raring
[18:08] <kelemengabor> and today we should start to assess what to do, and hopefully get some volunteers to actually do it
[18:10] <kelemengabor> what you see on the wiki is mostly the same as https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-r-sustainable-translations - things didn't moved at or since UDS
[18:11] <kelemengabor> we are looking for volunteers, who could spend a few hours per week on these activities
[18:11] <kelemengabor> the most urgent would be to start cranking out language pack updates for quantal
[18:12] <kelemengabor> then the rest: handling bugs (I guess I'll stay at this job), clean up the wiki under https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Translations/ to be more informative...
[18:13] <kelemengabor> handle the import queue and template priorities
[18:13] <kelemengabor> and solve whatever problem you come up with now :)
[18:14] <kelemengabor> also it would be great if you guys could participate on bi-weekly project meetings, just to see what tasks have all of us finished, what needs help or input
[18:15] <kelemengabor> we used this board on Trello in the Precise cycle to track such tasks:
[18:15] <kelemengabor> https://trello.com/board/translations-team/4f621c87861db54230b9ca39
[18:15] <kelemengabor> from this, you can have an idea of what lies ahead :)
[18:16] <kelemengabor> so... any comments, ideas?
[18:16] <kelemengabor> dpm: anything you would add?
[18:17]  * dpm reads
[18:18] <dpm> that sounds good
[18:18] <dpm> Right now the only part that's not open to community is the language pack generation, as it requires an account on a Canonical server
[18:19] <dpm> I need to talk to pitti to see if we can do something about it
[18:20] <dpm> or find someone within Canonical that can take over the responsibility of generating the langpacks, which pitti used to do
[18:20] <dpm> he now moved to the QA team and can no longer do that task
[18:20] <kelemengabor> then this is the most urgent thing :)
[18:22] <dpm> indeed
[18:23] <dpm> I'll see if I can find out more tomorrow and come back with more info tomorrow or Monday
[18:26] <kelemengabor> thanks in advance :)
[18:27] <kelemengabor> oh no... I see only now that the Quantal release schedule is just a copy of Precises :)
[18:28] <kelemengabor> we are this deeply out of hands :\
[18:30] <kelemengabor> anyone? I could help starting to operate the machinery, but even I can't do all of it alone :)
