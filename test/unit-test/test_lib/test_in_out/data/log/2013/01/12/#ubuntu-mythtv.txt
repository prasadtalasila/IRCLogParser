[17:26] <qwebirc89250> Hello I am looking to convert my existing old Windows xp box into a machine that I can connect to the internet and TV. Mainly to view online video's . I am looking to use mythbuntu as the OS for that.  Is that a good idea? Secondly do i need to format my windows machine or will this work as a muly-boot system when I get a choice on startup to boot with mythbuntu or windows?
[20:05] <Shadow__X> qwebirc89250: which online videos do you want to watch and how do you plan to connect the computer to your tv
[20:05] <Shadow__X> also do you plan to record tv?
[20:26] <qwebirc59685> No I dont plan on doing recording. I plan on connection it using a mini USB to HDMI cable.
[20:35] <Shadow__X> i am not sure if that connection will work in linux for starters, also if all you do is plan to watch online videos take a look at xbmc or something like that as it is probably better suited for your usage. Mythtv is really about recording so if you dont plan to record everything its kind of a waste imo
