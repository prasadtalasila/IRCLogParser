[07:09] <digigram> maaz coffee on
[07:09]  * Maaz washes some mugs
[07:09] <digigram> awesome bot!!
[07:11] <Cantide> :)
[07:11] <Cantide> that is a fine idea
[07:11]  * Cantide finishes his pap first though
[07:11] <digigram> then get yourself some
[07:12] <Cantide> does Maaz deliver? :D
[07:12] <Cantide> Maaz: coffee
[07:12] <Maaz> Cantide: coffee is liquid code
[07:12] <digigram> if you ask him nicely he might
[07:12] <Cantide> >_>
[07:12] <Cantide> Maaz: coffee, please
[07:12] <Maaz> Cantide: Go get it yourself!
[07:12] <digigram> het be nice
[07:12] <Cantide> hahahaha
[07:13] <digigram> hehe
[07:13]  * Cantide cries
[07:13] <Cantide> is everyone still using 12.04 btw?
[07:13] <Cantide> i tried 12.10 and failed
[07:13] <digigram> Maaz is normally mean to me, but it's okay, I understand his issues
[07:13] <Cantide> and since i came back to 12.04 i have been quite happy :)
[07:13] <Maaz> Coffee's ready for digigram!
[07:13]  * digigram uses Mint 13, so 12.04 yeah
[07:13] <digigram> thank you Maaz 
[07:14]  * digigram gives a botcookie to Maaz 
[07:14] <Cantide> do you use cinnamon?
[07:15] <digigram> MATE, but I want to try Min 14 with the updated Cinnamon, it looks really good
[07:15]  * Cantide puts cinnamon in digigram's coffee
[07:15] <Cantide> yeah, it does look nice
[07:15] <Cantide> i've finally gotten used to Unity
[07:15] <Cantide> it took me a few months :/
[07:16] <digigram> lol with time it might've worked for me, but I need something light
[07:16] <digigram> running my OS permanently from a USB drive, so access speed is limited
[07:49] <sharpey> whew
[07:49] <sharpey> morning all
[07:49] <Cantide> morning~
[07:49] <Cantide> digigram, i see :) is MATE light?
[07:50] <digigram> for me much lighter than unity!
[07:50] <digigram> or KDE
[07:50] <sharpey> freenode is blocking Kilos because of something to do with unaffiliated something
[07:50] <sharpey> grrr
[07:51] <Cantide> aww :(
[07:51] <Cantide> digigram, that's good news :) i've never bothered with KDE because it looks too heavy for me, and not very creative either imho
[07:51] <digigram> works great from harddrive on a very slow celeron, and works the same from flash drive on my i5 laptop
[07:51] <Cantide> Unity is unnecessarily heavy
[07:52] <digigram> KDE is very nice, I prefer it, but its on the heavy side
[07:53] <Cantide> it's a lot like Windows in terms of layout, isn't it?
[07:53] <digigram> If the i5 was my own laptop and not company laptop I would've had KDE on it right now
[07:53] <Cantide> i liked gnome 2.x, which is why i am tempted by cinnamon
[07:53] <Cantide> oh :)
[07:53] <sharpey> mate is very like
[07:54] <digigram> it does have a lot in common with windows in the visual department, but looks very much better
[07:54] <sharpey> very much faster than unity when installed on unity
[07:54] <sharpey> kight
[07:54] <sharpey> ai
[07:54] <sharpey> light
[07:54] <Cantide> :p
[07:54] <digigram> but as soon as I get home to my ADSL I'll get the new Cinnamon to try it out
[07:55] <Cantide> cool :)
[07:55] <Cantide> would you mind posting a few screenshots?
[07:55] <Cantide> curious Cantide is curious
[07:55] <digigram> of Cinnamon?
[07:55] <Cantide> yeah
=== sharpey is now known as Kilos
[07:57] <Kilos> whew
[07:57] <Cantide> is it working now?
[07:57] <digigram> Cantide here is some: http://www.linuxmint.com/rel_nadia_whatsnew.php#cinnamon
[07:57] <digigram> but remember, cinnamon on ubuntu and cinnamon on mint does not look the same
[07:57] <digigram> hey Kilos welcome at last !
[07:57] <Kilos> so where are the freenode experts
[07:57] <Kilos> unaffiliated/kilos :is now your hidden host (set by services.)
[07:58] <digigram> whats wrong Kilos 
[07:58] <Kilos> thats where my xchat sticks if i come right in as Kilos
[07:58] <Kilos> hi didgican
[07:58] <digigram> yeah, did you apply for a cloak?
[07:58] <Kilos> last week
[07:58] <digigram> well it's granted now
[07:58] <Kilos> hi digigram Cantide 
[07:59] <digigram> your cloak is unaffiliated/kilos
[07:59] <Kilos> lets hope i dont have to start of as sharpey everytime
[07:59] <Cantide> digigram, thanks for the link :) it's a bit different to gnome 2.x it seems
[07:59] <Cantide> integrated the top and bottom bar 'o'
[07:59] <digigram> I get this as well everytime:   unaffiliated/digigram :is now your hidden host (set by services.
[08:00] <Kilos> how do you get past it digigram ?
[08:00] <Kilos> it wouldnt log in any further
[08:00] <digigram> it's just a status message. It tells you you are cloaked now
[08:01] <Kilos> ya but stopped there, didnt log in
[08:01] <digigram> from there I just do / join #ubuntu-za
[08:01] <Kilos> didnt work
[08:01] <Kilos> oh well
[08:01] <digigram> weird
[08:02] <Kilos> when i try again as Kilos if it dont work ill go see #freenode as sharpey and ask their ops
[08:02] <digigram> yeah try that
[08:02] <digigram> but it should work...
[08:02] <Kilos> even tried to get in from maverick too
[08:03] <Kilos> ok lemme try. cant struggle with xchat like this everytime
[08:03] <Kilos> wbb
[08:04] <Kilos> yay
[08:05] <digigram> well I'm going to try and reach the beach or something, wayyyy to hot in my room
[08:05] <Kilos> just had to login from another nick and then identify Kilos
[08:05] <Kilos> hehe
[08:05] <Kilos> enjoy
[08:05] <digigram> is your IRC client set to auto identify?
[08:05] <Kilos> now it sees me first time as Kilos
[08:06] <Kilos> must be i always just get straight here
[08:07] <Kilos> maybe it was something to do with the cloak needing me to identify 
[08:07] <Kilos> weird after a week of being cloaked though
[08:07] <digigram> yes the cloak needs it. so if you keep on getting the issue after a restart or similiar, try removing your password from your client, the manually identigy
[08:08] <digigram> Just remembered I can't go to the beach. cut my foot and can't get sand in there. darnit
[08:14] <Kilos> Cantide, whats with the cinnamon and stuff now
[08:14] <Kilos> what have you been using
[08:15] <Cantide> i'm using Unity
[08:15] <Cantide> quite happy with it
[08:15] <Cantide> but my dad's "new" PC is not that powerful
[08:15] <Kilos> you get used to it yes
[08:15] <Cantide> so i was considering an alternate desktop
[08:15] <Cantide> also, he can't find the shutdown button on Unity haha
[08:15] <Cantide> so he switches it off at the wall -_-;
[08:16] <Kilos> i tried mate here on unity and it was 3 times as fast as unity and looked same as gnome2
[08:16] <Kilos> only had some sound probs so went back to unity
[08:16] <Kilos> haha
[08:17] <Kilos> you can add a shutdown on the desktop if i member right
[08:17] <Cantide> i think i might do that
[08:17] <Kilos> but mate is very fast
[08:17] <Cantide> but i think he can learn :p
[08:18] <Kilos> i enjoyed it but need alerts here and pidgin so i gave up

[09:19] <Kilos> hi theblazehen 
[09:19] <kbmonkey> using pygame, you can do most fast drawing and sounds
[09:19] <zeref> hi theblazehen 
[09:19] <Kilos> your bot beat you here
[09:20] <kbmonkey> hi theblazehen 
[09:35] <Kilos> why dont you clever guys install 0ad and help them develope the game
[09:41] <kbmonkey> what is that Kilos?
[09:41] <Kilos> its a game similar to AOE but in our repos
[09:42] <kbmonkey> aaah
[09:42] <kbmonkey> neat
[09:42] <Kilos> zero ad
[09:43] <Kilos> and somewhere they asked for peeps to give their input
[09:43] <Kilos> starting shows their irc addy and mail and all
[09:44] <Kilos> i need it developed more so i can win now and again
[09:44] <Kilos> hehe
[09:45] <kbmonkey> he he he
[09:45] <Kilos> i get killed terribly
[09:45] <kbmonkey> i never liked AOE though. I always liked Civilization more. Freeciv is the free one
[09:46] <Kilos> for linux?
[09:46] <kbmonkey> for everywhere
[09:46] <kbmonkey> in my repos
[09:46] <Kilos> b ig download?
[09:46] <Kilos> spose so
[09:46] <kbmonkey> its a turn based game, 0ad is real time
[09:47] <Kilos> i dont understand that
[09:48] <Kilos> oh your crashbang repos
[09:48] <kbmonkey> its about 18MB
[09:48] <Kilos> so small
[09:48] <Kilos> 0ad is 388m
[09:48] <Kilos> serious warfare
[09:49] <kbmonkey> turn based mean you can go make a coffee between moving men. he he
[09:49] <kbmonkey> each man gets a turn
[09:49] <Kilos> hahaha
[09:49] <kbmonkey> not like real time where you constantly have to click and do something
[09:49] <Kilos> you never heard of pause
[09:49] <Kilos> hehe
[09:49] <kbmonkey> he he
[09:54] <kbmonkey> oops. he got lost there
[09:55] <Kilos> wb zeref 
[09:56] <Kilos> bad connection again

[10:01] <Kilos> yeah
[10:01] <Kilos> can play games against each other
[10:01] <kbmonkey> ye. i'd like some freeciv players
[10:02] <kbmonkey> for us without too much time, you can take your turns daily for 15 mins
[10:02] <kbmonkey> so games can last weeks even
[10:02] <Kilos> lol
[10:02] <Kilos> thats worse than chess
[10:03] <kbmonkey> ha ha ha

[18:43] <Kilos> or even just leave a message
[18:43] <Kilos> post
[18:43] <inetpro> uh, that sounds like an assumption
[18:43] <Kilos> rofl
[18:44] <inetpro> the logical thing IMHO would be to open the link in your browser and go check out what it's all about before even thinking to post anything
[18:44] <Kilos> ai!
[18:45] <Kilos> if its in #ubuntu-za topic it would surely be to do with ubuntu not so
[18:45] <Kilos> or is that an assumption
[18:45] <inetpro> we would hope so
[18:46] <inetpro> but not just to do with ubuntu but but Ubuntu in South Africa
[18:46] <Kilos> ya thats the assumption
[18:47] <inetpro> ai

[18:50] <inetpro> oops... there's really no typing involved
