[09:35] <psivaa> hello, http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/ still has yesterday's images and 20130117 images are not under the 'current'tab. Is there any known reasons?
=== henrix_ is now known as henrix
[09:37] <Laney> psivaa: They sure look like today's images to me
[09:37] <Laney> what's the current tab?

[09:40] <psivaa> ha all of a sudden, thanks anyway
[09:43] <cjwatson> You seem to regularly check at just about the time when new builds are typically syncing
[09:43] <cjwatson> I suspect you'd save yourself some heartache if you just checked a bit later :)
[09:49] <psivaa> ok, ill remember that. Is there a specific time daily when i could be sure that the images would be there for use? from the right location?
[09:51] <cjwatson> Not really, just a bit later than what you've been trying
[09:52] <infinity> psivaa: Hard to guarantee a specific time when build lengths vary.
[09:52] <infinity> psivaa: Unless you want us to build them a few hours earlier and artificially delay publishing them. :P
[09:58] <psivaa> infinity: i agree that the time varies and for the same reason i can't sit and wait for ever. But ill wait some more time from now :)
[09:59] <infinity> psivaa: Sadly, there's no time to build/publish all images that would be ideal for everyone.  If we could work out such magic, we would. :)
[10:01] <psivaa> infinity: i understand
[11:16] <smartboyhw> Any release team members here???
[11:22] <cjwatson> better to ask what you want ...
[11:22] <smartboyhw> cjwatson, sorry for not asking:P
[11:23] <smartboyhw> If you guys saw the email on the ubuntu-release mailing list, I found that there isn't any x86 live images for Ubuntu Studio 12.04.2
[11:23] <cjwatson> I think I just fixed that
[11:24] <smartboyhw> cjohnston, when do you mean "just"? (since I just didn't see a new build having it)
[11:24] <smartboyhw> Sorry wrong ping
[11:24]  * smartboyhw hates tab failure
[11:25] <cjwatson> just now
[11:25] <cjwatson> like a few minutes ago
[11:26] <cjwatson> I didn't kick off any new builds - cron can do that
[11:26] <smartboyhw> Oh:D
[11:26] <smartboyhw> Thanks cjwatson :D
[11:26] <cjwatson> you should get one later today
[11:29] <smartboyhw> Thanks

[14:09] <mdeslaur> ScottK: any idea why bind9 is stuck in raring-proposed?
[14:15] <ScottK> mdeslaur: libnss-lwres would become uninstallable.
[14:16] <ScottK> (apparently)
[14:19] <mdeslaur> ScottK: ah, are you going to upload a rebuild?
[14:19] <ScottK> Let me look into it.
[14:19] <ScottK> I'd forgotten it didn't migrate.
[14:19] <mdeslaur> ScottK: thanks
[14:35] <ScottK> mdeslaur: Done.
[14:35] <mdeslaur> ScottK: thanks!
[14:35] <ScottK> Thanks for reminding me.

[17:31] <plars> infinity, balloons: we are still planning to start the release candidate/qa process for 12.04.2 next week correct?
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[17:35] <Riddell> anyone able to review qaccessibilityclient in New?  it's needed for new KDE due today
[17:42] <infinity> plars: Ish.  Though we'll have two extra weeks to play with there, so I suspect a few more fixes may slip in.
[18:02] <bjf> infinity, the kernel in -proposed/-updates today is the 12.04.2 kernel
[18:03] <infinity> bjf: That was my hope, yes.
[18:03] <bjf> infinity, we are going to skip the next kernel SRU cadence cycle
[18:07] <infinity> bjf: Kay, that should let things settle nicely.
[18:07] <infinity> bjf: Though, with the .2 release delay, you may be skipping two cycles.
[18:07] <infinity> bjf: Or, I guess, once we stop building against -proposed, we can let a new kernel into -proposed and just make sure not to promote it.
[18:09] <bjf> infinity, i think my next kernels my sit in my ppa for a bit
[18:09] <bjf> infinity, but we can work with whatever comes
[18:10] <infinity> bjf: *nod*... We'll figure it out.
[18:10] <infinity> bjf: Given that I do 99% of the kernel SRU processing, you know who to talk to when we need to coordinate this. :)
[18:11] <bjf> infinity, yup
[18:11] <infinity> bjf: Oh hey, and everything got marked for promotion earlier today.  Shiny.
[18:12] <infinity> Well, everything except lowlatency.  Those slackers.
[18:12] <infinity> apw: Are your studio minions doing some smoketesting on lowlatency?
[18:13] <apw> infinity, i have not heard specifics, will ask
[18:14] <infinity> apw: Kay.  Honestly, I just want 'em to boot them and make sure their hardware doesn't set on fire, since they should otherwise be able to piggyback on master's verification testing.
[18:15] <apw> i concur indeed, and if i was at home i would do it myself nwo
[18:15] <ogra_> go home then, quick !
[18:15] <infinity> Hah.
[18:16]  * apw will go the pub, that is home, right?
[18:16] <infinity> Sounds like a good home to me.
[18:16]  * ogra_ doubts thats a good place to test low latency 
[18:17]  * infinity sets about releasing all the other kernels.
[18:20] <infinity> Oh, I guess I should verify all the meta and dkms bits first.
[18:21] <bjf> infinity, maybe we should extend shank-bot that when it's run by you it does all the release stuff for the various packages
[18:24] <infinity> Bah.  The changelog for linux-meta-lowlatency was broken.
[18:24] <infinity> Oh well, not releasing that one right now anyway.
[18:25] <infinity> apw: Is linux-meta-lowlatency in git somewhere, or can I just upload to fix your changelog syntax oops?
[18:28] <rtg> infinity, I'd say just upload with a fix and apw can figure it out after the fact.
[18:28] <infinity> rtg: Fair enough.
[18:29] <rtg> drop him a note perhaps
[18:38] <infinity> cjwatson: Can I get a quickie review/accept of that linux-meta-lowlatency?
[18:40] <scott-work> oooooh :-D
=== henrix is now known as henrix_
[19:07] <infinity> bdmurray: *poke*
[19:09] <bdmurray> infinity: hmm what?
[19:09] <infinity> bdmurray: I'm trying to be a good citizen and not self-accept my own SRUs.  Can you give a quickie review/accept to linux-meta-lowlatency in precise?
[19:10] <infinity> bdmurray: Should be a 5-second review. :P
[19:12] <bdmurray> what a coincidence - I uploaded apport to quantal.
[19:12] <infinity> I'm betting this won't be a fair trade...
[19:12] <infinity> But I probably still owe you for making you look at glibc SRUs at one point, don't I?
[19:12] <bdmurray> not fair because your definition of 5 minutes is funny
[19:13] <infinity> bdmurray: No, my review really is 5 seconds.  Just fixing changelog syntax so dpkg-parsechangelog doesn't vomit. :P
[19:15] <infinity> Many thanks.
[19:15] <infinity> Now, where's this apport you spoke of?
[19:15] <infinity> bdmurray: Oh, the upload from 6 days ago?
[19:16] <bdmurray> infinity: yes that's the one
[19:17] <infinity> bdmurray: This doesn't need to go to precise as well?
[19:17] <infinity> (I'm guessing precise is entirely missing that codepath, or...?)
[19:20] <bdmurray> infinity: the only thing I know that is affected is the release upgrader and catching issue upgrading to quantal didn't seem as important...
[19:23] <infinity> bdmurray: So, who's going to rewrite apport in C, so it actually performs? :)
[19:25] <xnox> infinity: ev has urges to rewrite stuff in C from time to time =)
[19:26] <infinity> xnox: Well, with the push to mobile and other wimpy devices, the more we can purge python from the base system, the happier I'll be. :P
[19:27] <xnox> infinity: cause javascript is so much faster than python?!
[19:27]  * xnox chuckles
[19:30] <infinity> xnox: Yeah, not quite what I was driving for.
[19:35] <cjwatson> Thanks, but that sawfish won't build unless somebody also reviews rep-gtk.
[19:36] <cjwatson> (Though the version in precise was fine)
[19:47] <cjwatson> ah yes, and let's close the rep-gtk raring task in case that confuses anyone
[20:51] <infinity> cjwatson: Alright, that bcmwl in proposed just shaved another ~12M off the precise images.  Getting closer.
[20:54] <infinity> cjwatson: (compare 20130117 and 20130117.1)
=== Ursinha is now known as Ursinha-afk
[21:17] <infinity> bdmurray: If I can get you to review (again, sorry, missed a bug) linux-meta-lowlatency in both precise and quantal? :)
[21:18] <infinity> bdmurray: (Yeah, this wouldn't normally be time-sensitive, but trying to keep the meta SRUs and verifications lockstep with the kernels they match)
=== kenvandine is now known as ken[torture]
[21:37] <bdmurray> infinity: sure no problem
[21:37] <infinity> bdmurray: My hero.
[21:38] <infinity> bdmurray: Is there any specific order you're attacking the queues today?  I can start from the other end and try to get some done too.
[21:38] <bdmurray> I'm looking at Q and anything since 2013-01-01

[21:41] <infinity> xnox: Yeah, I know.  I'm not looking for just easy. :P
[21:41] <infinity> xnox: But I'll get to those.
[21:42] <bdmurray> infinity: I'm just going to accept it not sru-accept - okay?
[21:43] <infinity> bdmurray: Sure.
[21:43] <infinity> bdmurray: I normally never sru-accept kernely things anyway, since there's a whole out-of-band process there.
[21:44] <xnox> infinity: ack. I guess I should verify precise things that are in -proposed and are on the cd.
[21:46] <infinity> bdmurray: You're a scholar and a gentleman.
[21:46] <infinity> bdmurray: You might also smell nice too.  Can't say.
=== ken[torture] is now known as kenvandine
[22:42] <cjwatson> Could somebody process the dosfstools-udeb binaries in raring/NEW?  It's time-sensitive because I need to get matching SRUs in for 12.04.2 to meet a customer requirement
[22:43] <cjwatson> Should go into main - I'll be changing partman-basicfilesystems to depend on it shortly
[22:59] <infinity> cjwatson: I'll have a stab at it right now.
[23:00] <infinity> cjwatson: No postinst, contents look sane, looks good to me.
[23:01] <cjwatson> Yeah, I'd have had to try to get it wrong.  I dithered about whether to put dosfslabel in as well, but decided I didn't need it in partman-basicfilesystems.
[23:02] <infinity> cjwatson: You may regret that decision in a few months.  dosfslabel is pretty handy.
[23:02] <cjwatson> Easy enough to change if we do need it.  I don't believe I've ever used it though.
[23:02] <infinity> cjwatson: (though, in partman, you can sort of assume you're setting labels as a function of formatting filesystems, which mkdosfs does fine on its own)
[23:02] <cjwatson> Exactly
[23:03] <cjwatson> In fact it doesn't have a code path for doing otherwise AFAICS
[23:03] <cjwatson> (It arguably should, but)
[23:03] <infinity> We use(d) dosfslabel in jasper to hide the uboot VFAT partition.
[23:04] <infinity> Which, actually, partman-uboot could leverage, if it wasn't a steaming heap.
[23:06] <infinity> What I can't sort out is why dosfslabel is twice the size of mkdosfs...
[23:07] <cjwatson> Beats me
[23:07] <infinity> You'd think one could make it reeeeally tiny, as just a subset of mkdosfs.  Or, in fact, a hardlink/symlink that just invokes mkdosfs with a label-changing mode.
[23:07] <infinity> But whatever.
[23:08] <infinity> Carefactor: 0.
[23:08] <cjwatson> I think it links a buttload of objects it doesn't need
[23:08] <cjwatson> And something doesn't notice
[23:08] <cjwatson> but yeah, whatever.  maybe it's harder because it's reading an existing filesystem as well as writing bits out, and doing an overachieved job of it
[23:09] <cjwatson> mkdosfs just has to go "yeah, screw you, blat"
[23:09] <infinity> Heh.
[23:09] <infinity> Fair point.  I imagine writing a FAT is about the easiest filesystem creation there is.
[23:09] <infinity> And requires zero understanding of how to read it.
