[13:29] <tumbleweed> indeed, it is
[13:30] <Laney> you broke the pattern :(
[13:30] <tumbleweed> :)
[13:31] <geser> the discussion forecast for this channel for the next days would be "good morning", "afternoon", "evening", "good night"?
[13:32] <tumbleweed> you see, I've allowed a meta-discussion to start
[13:32]  * Laney had that in mind
[13:32] <Laney> then writing an LWN article about it
[13:32] <tumbleweed> it's not quite as good as a discussion about ubuntu development, but it's something

[20:14] <tumbleweed> jtaylor: yes, I mean to
[20:14] <tumbleweed> I gave it a while to stabilise, but I really should package it now
[20:14] <broder> hmm. so does anybody understand how bzr builddeb works with multi-orig 3.0 packages? i'm trying to do a merge-upstream and not finding a good way to do it
[20:14] <tumbleweed> already made sure it's B-Ds are in the archive
[20:14] <jtaylor> nice
[20:15] <tumbleweed> ohi broder
[20:15] <broder> hey tumbleweed
[20:15] <broder> sorry i've been MIA :)
[20:15] <tumbleweed> I wouldn't be suprised if it doesn't support them
[20:15] <broder> turns out this startup thing is a lot of wokr
[20:15] <broder> it totally supports them
[20:15] <tumbleweed> broder: we noticed :)
[20:15] <broder> import-dsc does the right thing
[20:15] <tumbleweed> it might just do the right thing because dpkg-source does, without handling all the details correctly
[20:16] <broder> no, it's creating separate upstream tags
