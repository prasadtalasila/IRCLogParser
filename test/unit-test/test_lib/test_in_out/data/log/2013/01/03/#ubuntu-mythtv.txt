[18:08] <qwebirc24906> Is analog in myth no longer working? There are a lot of us cable channels that are not digital.
[18:22] <gregL> qwebirc24906, It works for me...
[18:24] <qwebirc24906> I'm using 2 PVR-150 in 0.25 w/o any success. No channels found during scan.
[18:25] <gregL> qwebirc24906, I have one 150 and it works.. You should be fetching ,not scanning..
[18:25] <qwebirc24906> Could you please explain what you mean by fetching?
[18:26] <gregL> yes, are you using Schedule Direct for your epg source?
[18:27] <qwebirc24906> Yes I am
[18:27] <gregL> You have it set-up?
[18:29] <qwebirc24906> Yes I've run mythfilldatabase and it downloads the information in the terminal but when I go to channel no channels show.
[18:30] <gregL> Hang on a sec.
[18:31] <gregL> Under mythtv-setup did you create your video sources?
[18:33] <qwebirc24906> Yes I've setup a cable provider as a source.
[18:33] <gregL> did you connect the source to the imput..
[18:34] <gregL> sorry input?
[18:35] <qwebirc24906> Yes I have connected /dev/video0 and /dev/video1 to the source on both cards. Each has a coax cable feeding the tuner input
[18:37] <gregL> ok right next to where you choose scan you will see fetch ..It should download your lineup..
[18:39] <qwebirc24906> I've tried that but it doen't seem to do anything. The slider goes to 50% or so then justs quits. Under direct data in previous versions of mythtv it used to fill in some numbers after fetching. Now it doesn't.
[18:41] <gregL> are you running setup as the same user that is going to run MyThtv ?
[18:42] <gregL> Off to work good luck..
[18:44] <qwebirc24906> Thanks anyway
[18:50] <qwebirc24906> Anyone else who can help me? I have two PVR 150's Neither channel scan nor fetch listing works. Can't get guide data even though mythfilldatabase completes. Don't know where the downloaded guide data is going but doesn't appear to go to the database.
