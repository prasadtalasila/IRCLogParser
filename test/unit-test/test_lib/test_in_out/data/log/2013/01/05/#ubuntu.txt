[00:01] <fabio123> i saw a logitech keyboard which use solar energy... would be nice to have to same on laptops
[00:01] <stijn> nope, without the battery it wont boot lol
[00:01] <Transhumanist> I saw a review of those. Apparently they're no good, fabio. Don't do much charging.
[00:01] <Transhumanist> stijn: what model? Every laptop boots without the battery
[00:01] <stijn> http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/notebook/0000/Acer/Aspire5735Z/Aspire5735Zsp3.shtml
[00:01] <m3t4lukas> hey guys, my mysql-service and apache2-service is not starting at serverstart, but "root@<server>:~# update-rc.d apache2 defaults" says "System start/stop links for /etc/init.d/apache2 already exist."
[00:01] <Transhumanist> You've plugged in power, waited a minute or so for caps to charge maybe?
[00:01] <anonymous> Personally, if I wanted a solar-charged keyboard...I'd make it myself.
[00:02] <m3t4lukas> same with update-rc.d mysql defaults
[00:02] <stijn> it just booted to vista again! after i did the battery back
[00:02] <Transhumanist> Is the power adaptor turned on at mains, stijn?
[00:02] <anonymous> Ha! My random suggestions are actually helpful!
[00:02] <anonymous> For once.
[00:03] <ikonia> m3t4lukas: start it manually to verifythey actually work
[00:03] <stijn> pardon?
[00:03] <m3t4lukas> I did, they do, but after a restart they don't run anymore, but starting them manually always works after a reboot
[00:04] <ikonia> most odd
[00:04] <stijn> I guess i try AND reboot to see if it is still working
[00:04] <Transhumanist> stijn: I was just saying every laptop boots without battery if it is plugged into mains. You may need to plug the cable in, wait a minute or so, and make sure it's turned on at the wall socket, but it will work. You've got a hardware problem if it does not.
[00:05] <GeorgeJ> I'm running Ubuntu 12.10. I've installed deluged and deluge-web. The problem is: deluged comes with an init script in /etc/init.d, which, as long as I can tell tells upstart when the service starts, here's the file: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1497703/. The problem is, I wrote an upstart job for deluge-web as such: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1497681/. However, when I do sudo service deluged start, it does not also start deluged-web.
[00:05] <GeorgeJ> What could I be doing wrong? sudo service deluge-web start works just fine.
[00:06] <stijn> aha, now i have a purple screen when i choose ubuntu in the boot
[00:06] <m3t4lukas> yep, I don't know what else to do... I tried all I know
[00:06] <stijn> its flashing
[00:06] <stijn> logging in
[00:07] <spiffman> Jordan_U, going to reboot and get the exact error message, will that help?
[00:07] <ikonia> m3t4lukas: how are you starting it manually ?
[00:07] <ikonia> m3t4lukas: also have you set a root password ?
[00:08] <Transhumanist> George: if you get no answer here, try posting a thread on the forums
[00:08] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Sorry, I've been primarily doing other things.
[00:08] <{messedupmatthew> can anyone help me with my broadcom wifi drivers
[00:08] <Transhumanist> Uhg, Broadcom
[00:08] <stijn> thanks a lot guys :D next time ill remove the battery again xD
[00:08] <Jordan_U> spiffman: At the initramfs shell are you able to see sdb1 in the output from blkid?
[00:09] <stijn> good night
[00:09] <{messedupmatthew> ya  really irritatin me
[00:09] <Transhumanist> stijn: when you do remove the battery, also hit the power on button a few times to empty the capacitors
[00:09] <{messedupmatthew> its a macbook pro
[00:09] <stijn> thanks
[00:09] <jamie_> Could I have some help?
[00:09] <Transhumanist> probably. ask away.
[00:09] <jamie_> Thanks.
[00:10] <{messedupmatthew> drivers drivers?
[00:10] <jamie_> I'm trying to dual boot with xubuntu and Windows XP.
[00:10] <jamie_> When I run the XP disk, it goes blank.
[00:10] <jamie_> Is that because of the Linux partition?
[00:10] <spiffman> Jordan_U, i see the ntfs hard drive and the pendrive, i don't remember if the labels were the same
[00:10] <{messedupmatthew> stupid macbook :/
[00:10] <spiffman> Jordan_U, but the drive with both ubuntu's does not show...
[00:11] <folorn> any ideas how i can format a cd using the terminal?
[00:11] <{messedupmatthew> diskpart?
[00:11] <Transhumanist> jamie: what'd you do? Install XP, then install Xubuntu?
[00:11] <folorn> just type it in then messedupmathew?
[00:11] <jamie_> I'll pm you.
[00:11] <Transhumanist> no need. stick to this channel so others can help
[00:11] <jamie_> Okay.
[00:12] <jamie_> Well, I installed xubuntu.
[00:12] <jamie_> Now I want to dual boot with Windows XP.
[00:12] <{messedupmatthew> type what in
[00:12] <spiffman> Jordan_U, also, no rush :) thanks for helping
[00:12] <Transhumanist> Hmm. It's best to do the reverse, jamie
[00:12] <jamie_> When I run the XP disk, the hardware configuration bios appears but it goes blank.
[00:12] <folorn> k 1min need the disk i want to format 1sec messedup..
[00:12] <fabio123> jamie_, it's easier to install xp first, then xubuntu
[00:12] <jamie_> Do you think I need to delete the partition with ubuntu and create it again?
[00:12] <jamie_> Could that be the problem?
[00:12] <Transhumanist> if that's easy, yes
[00:13] <Transhumanist> Windows hates other OS's, and doesn't work well if installed later
[00:13] <jamie_> I'm on gparted as root and I'm looking at the partitions.
[00:13] <Transhumanist> it can be done, but it's more fiddly
[00:13] <jamie_> Would that make sense though, the reason the disk is going blank on the hardware config?
[00:13] <anonymous> "Hates" doesn't even describe it.
[00:13] <ikonia> Transhumanist: that is nonsense
[00:13] <Jordan_U> jamie_: No, the existance of Linux partitions will not cause Windows' installer to fail. Try asking about the problem you're having in ##windows .
[00:13] <fabio123> not to talk about windows 8, gpt partiotions, bios efi and secure boot
[00:13] <ikonia> windows works fine if installed second
[00:13] <anonymous> Not for me it doesn't.
[00:14] <Transhumanist> ikonia: except you then have to update grub, and various other things
[00:14] <jamie_> Well, it's got something to do with it.
[00:14] <{messedupmatthew> any help with my stupid broadcom drivers? :/
[00:14] <jamie_> On a clean harddrive, the disk works fine.
[00:14] <ikonia> Transhumanist: that's not Windows fault.....
[00:14] <Transhumanist> I've had horrible luck installing Windows after Ubuntu, so it isn't nonsense mate.
[00:14] <ikonia> Transhumanist: and updating grub is not "breaking" windows
[00:14] <Transhumanist> No, that part isn't.
[00:14] <ikonia> Transhumanist: it is nonsense.
[00:14] <jamie_> I've used a clean hard drive and I can run XP fine.
[00:14] <jamie_> Since installing Ubuntu, it won't install.
[00:14] <Transhumanist> Oh get bent. I'm not the only one who ahs had Windows act crappy because it was installed after Ubuntu.
[00:15] <ikonia> Transhumanist: please don't call me names, and please don't give miss-information
[00:15] <Jordan_U> Transhumanist: Please keep discussion civil.
[00:15] <jamie_> I spoke to a couple of people and they've had the same issue.
[00:15] <folorn> anyone know how to format cd's etc from the terminal ?
[00:15] <jamie_> I'll try and do it the other way around.
[00:15] <anonymous> It's not disinformation ikonia, it's true a majority of the time, Windows simply doesn't cooperate.
[00:15] <Transhumanist> Well you're directly contradicting the experiences of others, ikonia. Accept that installing Windows after Ubuntu doesn't always work well.
[00:16] <Jordan_U> jamie_: I'm almost certain that that your new inability to install Windows is not related to anything Ubuntu has done.
[00:16] <jamie_> I'm not saying it's ubuntu's fault.
[00:16] <ikonia> anonymous: I'm sorry but the order you install the OS does not effect windows stability
[00:16] <jamie_> I'm asking could there be compatibility issues?
[00:16] <Jordan_U> jamie_: ##windows might be able to help you get Windows' installer working.
[00:16] <lukas_> ikonia: Any suggestions/tips?
[00:16] <jamie_> I've checked other forums and people have had similiar issues.
[00:16] <Transhumanist> jamie: in this case, the Windows install CD should work fine, regardless of what is installed on the HD's
[00:16] <ikonia> lukas_: with what ?
[00:17] <jamie_> Well I've tried installing it on a clean hdd.
[00:17] <jamie_> It works fine.
[00:17] <anonymous> ikonia: I would refute, but I think this is just becoming unnecessary flood, so I'm going to fade into the background.
[00:17]  * anonymous fades.
[00:17] <atlef> folorn, http://www.upubuntu.com/2011/10/how-to-erase-cd-rw-dvd-rw-disc-from.html
[00:17] <jamie_> When it comes to this one, it refuses to even open the text installer for xp.
[00:17] <Jordan_U> jamie_: This is the wrong channel. Please ask in ##windows.
[00:17] <jamie_> Okay.
[00:18] <jay__> Hi
[00:18] <{messedupmatthew> can someone lend me some knowledge about my broadcom wifi drivers? please?
[00:19] <jay__> I have just installed ubuntu 12.10 on intel x64 machine and would like to install windows 8 off flashh drive. Whats the best way to go about it without causing any mbr/grub problems
[00:19] <ikonia> !broadcom | {messedupmatthew
[00:19] <ubottu> {messedupmatthew: Help with Broadcom bcm43xx can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[00:19] <{messedupmatthew> thank u
[00:19] <jamie_> Windows 8.
[00:19] <jamie_> Oh god.
[00:19] <folorn> lol
[00:19] <jay__> I cant find windows 7 x64 online
[00:20] <ikonia> jay__: install windows 8, install ubuntu, that simple
[00:20] <Transhumanist> wtf ikonia. that was uncalled for.
[00:20] <jay__> ive already installed ubuntu
[00:20] <fabio123> what about secure boot?
[00:20] <XMLnewbi_> could not create work tree dir 'electrumpos'.: Permission denied
[00:20] <XMLnewbi_> this a permission problem on my server or gethub settings?
[00:21] <Jordan_U> fabio123: Ubuntu 12.10 works on secure boot enabled firmware.
[00:21] <spiffman> Jordan_U, I compared the grub.cfg entries for the 32-bit ubuntu and the 64-bit ubuntu installations. The only differences (besides root=) are the options recordfail, insmod gzio, and gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode (they exist only in the 32-bit entry)
=== Plinker_ is now known as Plinker
[00:22] <spiffman> should these options be present in the 64-bit entry?
[00:24] <jay__> im using amd 7970 gpu anyway i can update driver to so ubuntu can do dual extended monitor?
[00:24] <olynch> I currently have a problem logging in, when I hit enter it just brings me back to the login window after a black screen
[00:24] <anonymous> jay__: I'm confused, off a flash drive? Can Windows 8 even fit on a flash drive? If so, DAMN, I need to keep up with technology. Anyway...
[00:24] <jay__> yh im using yumi
[00:24] <anonymous> It should(presumably) work the same if you simply tell the BIOS to boot the USB first, and put it in.
[00:25] <anonymous> But, I have no idea, really.
[00:25] <iBurley> l
[00:25] <jay__> its not that ive been having mbr problems for the past week
[00:25] <jay__> and have successfully re-built the mbr using easeus partion usb boot
[00:26] <iBurley> Anybody ever had problems in Ubuntu where it won't recognize your side mouse buttons? Like, they will take you forward and backwards in your browser, but you can't bind them to anything?
[00:26] <jay__> setup is this ssd 64gb (ubuntu) ssd 256(windows)
[00:26] <iBurley> Specifically, I want to bind the browser forward button as push to talk in TeamSpeak.
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:27] <iBurley> but it doesn't do anything
[00:27] <Jordan_U> jay__: After installing Windows you can follow this guide to restore grub: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_ChRoot
[00:28] <XMLnewbi_> read up on the error, it says I should install into a differnt dir but the walthough says to install in /var   is there a way to allow writing in var? I tried sudo   https://github.com/kangasbros/electrumpos/blob/master/electrumpos/install.txt
[00:28] <jay__> cheers jordan
[00:28] <anonymous> Oh god, that reminds me of the time I tried removing Ubuntu temporarily and broke GRUB, silly me.
[00:28] <anonymous> I was able to get it fixed without tutorials though...yay me.
[00:29] <spiffman> does anyone know how to append grub menu options in grub2?
=== ident is now known as Guest73892
[00:29] <lukas_> ikonia: with the mysql and apache2 that doesn't start
[00:31] <Jordan_U> spiffman: recordfail, insmod gzio, and gfxmode are all commands which would not affect linux's ability to access a drive.
[00:32] <jay__> anyone us xchat?
[00:32] <jay__> use
[00:32] <jay__> how do i add a channel
[00:32] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Can you be on IRC and at the initramfs shell at the same time?
[00:32] <Jordan_U> jay__: /join #channel
[00:33] <XMLnewbi_> fatal: https://github.com/kangasbros/electrumpos/tree/master/electrumpos/info/refs not found: did you run git update-server-info on the server?
[00:33] <spiffman> Jordan_U, I can't think of any way, this is the only computer I have available
[00:34] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Smartphone?
[00:34] <spiffman> Jordan_U, ooh cool, never thought to irc from my phone. brb
[00:35] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Unfortunately I need to leave soon. I may be able to help tomorrow though.
[00:36] <spiffman> Jordan_U, ah ok, thanks anyways. anything i might try on my own in initramfs?

[00:38] <novaspirit> i have a question about zram.. modules is loaded but it's missing a folder called /sys/block/zramX/disksize/
[00:40] <Jordan_U> spiffman: "ls -l /dev/disk/by-path/" might be interesting, and "cat /proc/partitions". It's odd that the ssd is not (apparently) not being detected. "dmesg" might give useful error messeges as well.
[00:40] <Jordan_U> spiffman: How is the ssd connected?
[00:41] <spiffman> Jordan_U, the ssd is in the laptop, the WD drive is connected via usb
[00:41] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Even more odd that the ssd is the drive not showing up then.
[00:42] <WeThePeople> does having a swap partition essential for ubuntu to work correctly?
[00:42] <spiffman> Jordan_U, the ssd is showing up, the WD drive is not. both ubuntu's are in the WD drive

[00:56] <dr_willis> DrCode:  best to use a live cd.
[00:56] <DrCode> Ok
[00:56] <dr_willis> dding a running system can cause issues

Here's a few: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BackupYourSystem , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DuplicityBackupHowto , https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HomeUserBackup , https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MondoMindi - See also !sbackup and !cloning
[00:57] <DrCode> like partclone
[00:57] <atlef> clonezilla
[00:58] <dr_willis> it all depends on the details of how you want to backup/restore
[00:58] <DrCode> I think thay use partclone

[00:58] <DrCode> I mean disk image like dd

[01:01] <artie> hi all, I just installed Xubuntu 12.10, but can't find skype in the software center. Has it been discontinued or restricted in some manner by microshaft? Appreciate any info regarding it's continued suitability in ubuntu.
[01:01] <doctorly> I have ubuntu running in text mode by editing grub. but when I try to start x, the screen stays blank on the background and nothing happens. I can still move my mouse around, and when I press the power button, the power options do come up. also if I start it in graphical mode from startup, it works fine. can someone offer me a solution please:)
[01:01] <dr_willis> !skype
[01:01] <ubottu> To install Skype on Ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype - To record on Skype, check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto - Please use open protocols instead if you can, see !Ekiga
[01:01] <MeanEYE> artie: You have to download it from their site.
[01:02] <dr_willis> doctorly:  try 'sudo service lightdm start'
[01:02] <dr_willis> doctorly:  see if unity works that way
[01:04] <artie> ty ubotto, will look at those links.
[01:05] <MeanEYE> artie: it's a bot :D
[01:05] <dr_willis> a FEMbot! ;)
[01:05] <Haled> is there a script that removes all the annoying things in ubuntu (ubuntu one\music store\ facebook desktop integration Etc)?
[01:05] <MeanEYE> Haled: nope, but it's easy to make one.
[01:05] <dr_willis> Haled:  one mans annoying thing is anothers must have feature.. so i doubt it.
[01:06] <artie> MeanEYE: ty, but it's been in the software center recently and i was curios regarding it's unavaibility from the software center.....sometimes the unavailability of a program means something has happened and that the powers don't recommend it anylonger::>
[01:06] <dr_willis> Ubuntu One is very handy
[01:06] <Haled> well, make it less "canonical" anyways
[01:06]  * Haled uses dropbox
[01:06] <Haled> but it's the least problematic feature
[01:06] <MeanEYE> artie: Skype is closed source and spyware. So it has no business in our repos. :D Debian is pretty strict about that.
[01:08] <cyphase> does anyone know of a tool for managing file permissions on an entire filesystem? e.g. it scans the entire fs then tells you things like which files are readable/editable by other users, or search by permissions, etc
[01:08] <MeanEYE> cyphase: "find" can handle that. But it's not a tool for that specific role. It's a lot more powerful.
[01:08] <artie> MeanEYE: yes, Im aware of the problems with software that isn't opensourced and try to avoid it at all costs.
[01:08] <dr_willis> creativer use of  the 'find' command can do that

[01:09] <aquarius__> My disc is showing many disc errors in dmesg, and it appears to have been remounted read-only. I'm not sure how best to recover from this. I don't want to reboot, in case it's torched and doesn't come back. Is there anything I can try?
[01:10] <MeanEYE> cyphase: do you need help with "find" or you'll do research on your own?
[01:10] <artie> I was kinda wonderin if Bill Gates made it unavailable to linux users as a tactic to minimize competition with his software.
[01:10] <Kion1> MeanEYE: Why do you say skype is spyware?
[01:10] <MeanEYE> artie: Sad thing is, since Microsoft bought Skype, they are more regular with updates.
[01:10] <cyphase> MeanEYE, i know find can do most of what i want, but a gui tool would be nice. i can do the research on my own if needed though
[01:11] <MeanEYE> Kion1: Because it gets data from your computer and sends home. :D
[01:11] <MeanEYE> Kion1: http://www.pagetable.com/?p=27
[01:11] <Kion1> MeanEYE: have you caught it with wireshark or something?
[01:11] <MeanEYE> Kion1: I don't use it. And everything is encrypted so you can't see what's being sent. They were cought some time ago. And somehow I doubt Microsoft removed snooping tools.
[01:12] <artie> Kion1:if it isn't opensourced, then you don't know what's in the software and what it actually does to your computer.....hence it is thought of as spyware.
[01:13] <MeanEYE> artie: They were actually cought dumping bios. When people complained they said it was for DRM purposes.
[01:13] <MeanEYE> caught*
[01:14] <artie> MeanEYE: didn't know they actually got caught red handed.  ty that info.
[01:14] <MeanEYE> artie: http://www.pagetable.com/?p=27 More info there. There were other cases as well.
[01:15] <artie> I notice there are more internet telephone software packages listed in the software center these days.......I hope linux people will make something usable so that we don't have to use microsoft software.
[01:16] <Kion1> I agree with that skype, belive that itunes , etc are spying
[01:16] <Kion1> Can Ekiga communicate with skype contacts?
[01:16] <MeanEYE> Kion1: no. Skype is closed source, closed protocol and further more encrypted.
[01:17] <MeanEYE> artie: Google Talk is nice. It's not open source plugin, but protocol is open, and you can use pidgin and empathy for video calls. Although I didn't get too much success getting it to work.
[01:17] <artie> my daughter uses itunes and doesn't seem to have a clue regarding the collection of data that can be traced to her individually.
[01:17] <Kion1> artie: 100% with you
[01:18] <Kion1> Privacy was what drived me away from Microsoft and into Linux
[01:18] <MeanEYE> Kion1: came to the right place.
[01:18] <artie> I think apple got caught collecting gps data on iphone and ipod internet capable devices..to the best of my knowledge, they have not repented.
[01:18] <MeanEYE> artie: I think media made it far worse than it is. And Apple is kind of clueless with programming.
[01:19] <Kion1> seems like today we have the choice of whom will spy on us, apple or google! ja
[01:19] <Kion1> I do not trust my droid phone at all
[01:19] <artie> Kion1: right on, Im here for the same reason. Been Microsoft free since May 2011, so Im relatively new.
[01:20] <Kion1> I was freed on 2008 by linux
[01:20] <MeanEYE> Kion1: Google is a lot less violent with the data. I do use their services, but at least my data is not going anywhere. :D
[01:20] <Kion1> MeanEYE: yes, that is my perception and that is why I have a droid and not any i-whatever
[01:21] <MeanEYE> Kion1: also, since Android is Linux, you can craft hosts file nicely to prevent google analytics and other snooping sites from getting any data. :D
[01:22] <Kion1> Once out of curiosity I set my ubuntu box as a router and hooked my macbook, and listened to the bridge with wireshark, I blocked and logged any ip adress of mac, my mac went nuts trying to phone home, hundreds of times a minute on different ips of mac
[01:22] <artie> Kion1: they all spy, the personal data they collect is sold to advertising industry that uses the info to target advertising campaigns etc.
[01:23] <MeanEYE> Good thing Google is not selling data, as they are in Ads business. Doesn't pay off to sell precious data. :D So at least am getting good ads.
[01:23] <Kion1> artie: I know,a couple of days ago I needed to spec screws,  and guess what comes to my spam..... Freaking screw offers!!!
[01:23] <MeanEYE> Anyway, this is offtopic.
[01:23] <Kion1> sorry
[01:24] <artie> MeanEYE: it
[01:24] <Fudge> has anyone noticed problems setting up indicator weather in the last version
[01:24] <MeanEYE> Well, :D am guilty as well. But this channel is for support.
[01:24] <artie> 's OT for sure, but it's good to spread the word-there are many who don't even have a clue::>
[01:24] <MeanEYE> Fudge: last version of what, and on which version of OS.
[01:25] <Fudge> MeanEYE  the last versin of indicator weather and precise LTS
[01:25] <MeanEYE> Generally speaking, the best thing you can do is contact developer.
[01:26] <MeanEYE> Since it's LTS it's unlikely that API has changed.
[01:26] <Fudge> I believe I saw an update to it, now on ii  indicator-weather                      11.11.28-0ubuntu1.2
[01:26] <artie> MeanEYE and Kion1: I'm gonna be trying those open sourced telephone apps listed in the software center now......ty for discussion on privacy related issues.. GL to all.
[01:27] <MeanEYE> Fudge: did you check this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/169215/weather-indicator-app-stopped-working ?
[01:27] <MeanEYE> artie: okay!
[01:28] <acib708> Hey, anyone else having problems downloading ubuntu desktop right now? Seems like the download page is down for me
[01:29] <Kion1> artie: Good luck Ekiga is very good i think
[01:29] <Fonsie> its working for me
[01:29] <Fonsie> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&bits=64&distro=desktop&status=zeroc
[01:29] <MeanEYE> acib708: perhaps all the fuss over phone OS is causing problems. My suggestion is to take a look at torrents: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads
[01:30] <MeanEYE> acib708: If you have problems getting torrent files I can give you a link to one (or reupload).
[01:30] <acib708> Thank you, will try torrents. Has anyone tried Ubuntu on a retina macbook?
[01:30] <MeanEYE> Screen like any other.
[01:30] <MeanEYE> Not sure about hardware support though.
[01:31] <Fudge> MeanEYE  nope that is not the problem, the final apply button does not do anything when adding your location
[01:31] <acib708> Thank you
[01:31] <Kion1> acib708: I tried to install Ubuntu on my macbook without luck
[01:31] <MeanEYE> Fudge: take a look at .xsession-errors maybe there's something there.
[01:32] <Fonsie> i need help, i tried installing ubuntu and when i tried booting it after installation got nothing but a bunch of scrolling text then it stopped and nothing happened then somebody suggested using lubuntu and so i installed that and when i tried botting that got nothing but a command prompt screen
[01:32] <MeanEYE> Kion1: acib708: I believe Mac support is going to change. Greg Kroah Hartman was working on it. He has one as well.
[01:32] <artie> acib708: I couldnt download it 3 days ago to save my live...downloads would start and close after 100 to 200 MB, for some reason, firefox thought downloads were complete......but, day before yesterday had no problem downloading it, worked first time.
[01:32] <acib708> I have installed lin on previous Mac system, but I was just wondering about the retina, since I don't want the actual resolution (everything will look tiny) but the 1440 res, with double density
[01:32] <acib708> thanks artie
[01:33] <MeanEYE> acib708: You can change font rendering resolution. So that will help.
[01:34] <artie> acbi708: Were you having similar issues or were you just unable to connect to the download site??
[01:34] <acib708> I'm unable to connect. I click download, and it takes me to http://releases.ubuntu.webxcreen.org//quantal/ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso which then hangs, until the browser says it can't open the page
[01:36] <Kion1> acib708: what if you try with wget maybe...
[01:37] <acib708> If the torrent fails, I'll try wget, thank you (:
[01:38] <MeanEYE> acib708: It wont. :D
[01:39] <Fonsie> anybody have a minute to answer a few questions?
[01:39] <MeanEYE> Shoot.
[01:39] <Fonsie>  i tried installing ubuntu and when i tried booting it after installation got nothing but a bunch of scrolling text then it stopped and nothing happened then somebody suggested using lubuntu and so i installed that and when i tried botting that got nothing but a command prompt screen
[01:40] <Fonsie> booting*
[01:40] <Kion1> Fonsie: try startx
[01:40] <cordyceps> where are vlc log(s)?
[01:40] <Fonsie> vlc logs?
[01:40] <Kion1> or sudo /etc/init.d/lightdm restart
[01:40] <dr_willis> whatcommand prompt exactly?grub or bash
[01:40] <Anaphaxeton> tools/x86_64-lfs-linux-gnu/bin/ld: warning: libz.so.1, needed by /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/4.7/../../../x86_64-linux-gnu/libxml2.so, not found (try using -rpath or -rpath-link)
[01:40] <cordyceps> got an error, vlc says look in the log. Where?
[01:41] <cyphase> or sudo restart lightdm
[01:41] <Anaphaxeton> libz.so exist in the same dir as libxlm2.so
[01:41] <dr_willis> look in your home dir cordyceps
[01:41] <cordyceps> k, thx
[01:41] <Kion1> cyphase: It is usually better to state it with the full path /etc/init.d/lightdm restart
[01:42] <MeanEYE> cordyceps: As far as I know, vlc spits everything on terminal. So if you can start it again, start it from command line and see what comes up.
[01:42] <Fonsie> so type in either "startx" or "/etc/init.d/lightdm restart"
[01:42] <VlanX> could please anybody help me to fing video drivers for my old ATI card?
[01:42] <Kion1> Fonsie: try each
[01:42] <MeanEYE> VlanX: Be specific which card.
[01:42] <Kion1> Fonsie: with Sudo
[01:42] <Fonsie> sudo?
[01:43] <Kion1> Fonsie: yes it means "Super user do"
[01:43] <dr_willis> just try 'startx'first/
[01:43] <Fonsie> all i know is i installed it then when i rebooted, there was a command prompt asking for login id and password
[01:44] <Fonsie> so type my id and password then try what you suggested?
[01:45] <Kion1> Fonsie: yes
[01:45] <Fonsie> alright, thank you
[01:45] <VlanX> MeanEYE: http://pastebin.com/KSYJ8Ncw
[01:45] <Six92> Hello all .... anyone have a link that explains how to get Ubuntu loaded as the sole OS on a late 2012 Mac Mini?
[01:46] <MeanEYE> VlanX: I don't think your card is supported by official ATI drivers.
[01:47] <VlanX> MeanEYE: that means i wouldn't be able to use 3D with 12.10 ?
[01:47] <MeanEYE> VlanX: I think you would be able to, but not sure if gaming is an option.
[01:48] <VlanX> MeanEYE: no. i would just like to have the 3D acceleration for unity
[01:48] <MeanEYE> VlanX: So you need to install xserver-xorg-video-radeon
[01:48] <MeanEYE> That's open source ATI driver, which has your card listed as supported.
[01:49] <MeanEYE> You can get more information here: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man4/radeon.4.html
[01:49] <MeanEYE> On what's supported and what's not.
[01:49] <VlanX> MeanEYE: great, thank you :)
=== qos|away is now known as qos
[01:50] <MeanEYE> VlanX: You are welcome. You could check if official one supports it, but if I remember correctly windows drivers don't support that card anymore, so I doubt Linux ones do.
=== ident is now known as Guest89286
[01:52] <VlanX> MeanEYE: no, i don't expect an AGP 86x card to be supported anymore, that is out of the quesion. It is just sad to trow away a 2.8GhZ PC, so i tought i could get linux on it and give it to my little brother :)
[01:52] <MeanEYE> VlanX: Oh, okay. ATI is not all that cooperative.
[01:53] <MeanEYE> VlanX: Good news is, open source drive is in a lot better state than nVidia's one.
[01:53] <jay__> Is there any software that blocks internationally calls 'if i somehow connected landline through pc'
[01:53] <VlanX> MeanEYE: i always tought that was nvidia to be non friendly with linux
[01:54] <anonymous> Did...did you just say an open source driver is in a better state than a proprietary one? MADNESS! Wish I had a graphics card to test that statement.
[01:54] <jay__> getting too many cold calls
[01:54] <MeanEYE> VlanX: all of them are. They are afraid of opening source code. They think people will steal their secret optimizations.
[01:54] <anonymous> I really need to get a new machine, mine...has a Celeron D, that should say enough.
[01:54] <MeanEYE> anonymous: No, came out wrong. :) Open source driver for ATI is better than Nouveau.
[01:54] <MeanEYE> I think.
[01:55] <Kriminel_> VlanX i concur, i managed to completely toast 12.10 with the nvidia driver
[01:55] <anonymous> Oh, I see.
[01:55] <anonymous> Well thanks for clarifying.
[01:55] <MeanEYE> :D Don't mention it.
[01:56] <VlanX> now this sucks... i switched completely to linux months ago and i aint getting back to windows for all the gold in the world
[01:56] <MeanEYE> VlanX: Why that sucks?
[01:57] <dr_willis> ive had very few issues with nvidia. but it can depend on the exact chipset
[01:57] <dr_willis> noveau drivers seem to work well for desktop ussage also
[01:57] <MeanEYE> Yup. Nice and stable.
[01:58] <zwirc> Is there any differnce in Apache2 and Apache Tomcat?
[01:58] <VlanX> MeanEYE: well, if i was a gamer i should have a partition w/ windows just to get the games running and this is nonsense
[01:58] <jay__> anyone use wine for photoshop/ heavy cpu dependent software
[01:58] <Six92> Sorry I lost connection
[01:58] <MeanEYE> VlanX: Not anymore. With Steam now, number of games are increasing.
[01:58] <VlanX> jay__: i'd like to know if i can run photoshop w/ wine too
[01:59] <MeanEYE> VlanX: I have 40ish games from humble bundle, and few more on Steam.
[01:59] <Six92> Anyone have a guide on how to install ubuntu on a late 2012 mac mini please? I have Googled til I am blue
[01:59] <VlanX> MeanEYE: too bad market share for linux is still 1-1.5 %
[01:59] <MeanEYE> VlanX: A lot of people say those numbers are incorect. And that they are somewhere around 8 or 9.
[02:00] <MeanEYE> VlanX: Fun fact is, Microsoft considers Linux to be a far bigger threat than Apple.
[02:00] <dr_willis> Six92:  ubuntu forums or askubuntu.com would be where id look
[02:00] <Six92> thanks, been all over to try and find a way
[02:01] <Six92> everyone says VM
[02:01] <Six92> ;(
[02:01] <Six92> I want Ubuntu to be the sole OS
[02:02] <KsM> < MeanEYE> VlanX: Fun fact is, Microsoft considers Linux to be a far bigger threat than  Apple.
[02:02] <VlanX> MeanEYE: i have a friend of mine which is a lawyer and of course she knows nothing about PC's and stuff, she asked me to get her PC rid of win 8. I installed 12.10, a little afraid that she couldn't get used to the change, but she hated win 8 so much that she beg me to get that thing off at any cost. Surprisingly enough she managed to get along perfectly with Ubuntu and that was a great pleasure for me :)
[02:02] <jay__> Six92: Lacks software
[02:02] <jay__> Top end
[02:02] <KsM> probably only because Apple tries to make it so you can only install Mac OS on Apple's machines
[02:03] <doctorly> whoever gave me the tip about "sudo service lightdm start" thanks a ton! I couldnt respond because my interface started, or I would have thanked you then:)
[02:03] <jay__> KsM: Im sure apple allow you to install other os's on there machines
[02:03] <KsM> no, iirc, Apple machines have a special ID chip or -something- that tells the OS that it's an apple machine
[02:03] <jay__> anyone use wine?
[02:03] <xangua> !anyone | jay__
[02:03] <ubottu> jay__: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[02:04] <dr_willis> jay__:  lots of people do
[02:04] <KsM> and when people hackintosh or whatever they find a way to bypass that
[02:04] <VlanX> jay__: i do
[02:04] <MeanEYE> VlanX: http://www.osnews.com/story/21035/Ballmer_Linux_Bigger_Competitor_than_Apple
[02:04] <KsM> but I might be wrong on how they do it, but I'm pretty sure they do it
[02:04] <Six92> I need an idiots guide I guess
[02:05] <doctorly> how can you scroll through letters in links2 to select specific text? hope someone knows this!
=== flowerhack___ is now known as flowerhack
[02:05] <jay__> How does wine handle photoshop?
[02:05] <MeanEYE> jay__: Depends on version.
[02:06] <VlanX> MeanEYE: now this graph is wrong. Between yellow and blue it's more like the opposite :P
[02:06] <Fonsie> ok, so i typed startx in the command prompt in lubuntu and it went through a ton of text then stopped and said there was an error
[02:07] <jay__> MeanEye: cs6 extended x64bit
[02:07] <VlanX> and really so many ppl stuck to IE ?
[02:07] <VlanX> pretty sick
[02:07] <MeanEYE> VlanX: it's microsoft internal stuff. But good thing is, Microsoft's presence on inteernet fell below 30%. Which is good. No more monopoly.
[02:07] <Transhumanist> VlanX: yeah I got my girlfriend onto 12.10 in a similar way. Windows 7 was so bogged down with crap, and had always run slowly on the laptop she had bought that CAME with it! I installed Ubuntu 12.10, and besides the learning curve of switching from explorer to Unity, she's loved it. So much faster.
[02:08] <acib708> does anyone know whats the 12.10 desktop 64 bit iso md5 checksum?
[02:08] <MeanEYE> jay__: appdb.winehq.com says silver. So it might work. Older versions are probably better supported.
[02:09] <seednode> acib708, does it not say on the site...?
[02:09] <Transhumanist> acib708: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
[02:09] <acib708> oh, thanks
[02:09] <Transhumanist> np
[02:09] <VlanX> MeanEYE, Transhumanist: i'm telling you guys, the thing that made the most revenue for micro$oft was the high number of pirated copies on windows, that managed to let it become so used and popular
[02:09] <MeanEYE> VlanX: no, they are way off. If you take into account android, ios, chrome, firefox. MS is way down.
[02:09] <Fonsie> can anybody help me for a minute?
[02:09] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: just ask a question, don't ask about asking. :D
[02:09] <Transhumanist> dunno yet, Fonsie. You haven't asked.
[02:09] <Transhumanist> :p
[02:10] <dr_willis> state the error message if any...
[02:10] <Fonsie> ok, so i typed startx in the command prompt in lubuntu and it went through a ton of text then stopped and said there was an error
[02:10] <Fonsie> there was an error message but forgot exactly what it said
[02:10] <zwirc> I did a mistake and sudo chown -R user:user /
[02:11] <zwirc> anyway to fix?
[02:11] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: Logs for Xorg are located at /var/log/Xorg.0.log, check for errors there.
[02:11] <Fonsie> when i typed that in it said permission denied
[02:11] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: Try "
[02:11] <MeanEYE> Try "cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log"
[02:12] <Jordan_U> zwirc: To be safe you really need to re-install unfortunately.
[02:12] <Fonsie> ahh, also...when i was in here before and somebody said to use the startx command they also gave me another command but i forgot it
[02:13] <Fonsie> it wasa sudo command
[02:13] <Fonsie> was a*
[02:13] <MeanEYE> zwirc: It's best to reinstall as Jordan_U said. Just to keep your system secure.
[02:13] <zwirc> Jordan_U tnx
[02:13] <Jordan_U> zwirc: You're welcome.
[02:13] <goddard> what is the lightest DE?
[02:13] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: You should have access to logs without super user priviledges.
[02:13] <MeanEYE> goddard: Depends what you consider DE, and how light. E17 is worth looking at.
[02:14] <jay__> how do i install flash. Even though I have. Youtube keeps saying "the adobe flash player is required@
[02:14] <MeanEYE> goddard: I personally use i3 window manager. And it's the lightest thing ever.
[02:14] <dr_willis> goddard:  lightest full featured de would be 'lubuntu'
[02:14] <MeanEYE> jay__: which browser?
[02:14] <jay__> firefox
[02:14] <dr_willis> goddard:  which uses lxde
[02:15] <MeanEYE> jay__: sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer
[02:15] <Fonsie> meanEYE: if i find an error in the logs how do i fix it?
[02:15] <Transhumanist> I thought Flash wasn't supported anymore?
[02:15] <Transhumanist> what version of Flash is that?
[02:15] <rbnswartz> If I find an old bug on launchpad that I know has already been fixed or is irrelevant what steps should I take to get it closed?
[02:15] <goddard> MeanEYE, lxde is lighter then xfce?
[02:15] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: depends on the error. Let us know and we'll try to help.
[02:15] <Fonsie> alright, thank you
[02:15] <dr_willis> goddard:  lxde is lighter then xfce. yes
[02:15] <MeanEYE> goddard: Depends, both based on GTK.
[02:16] <MeanEYE> But yeah it is.
[02:16] <goddard> im trying to get netflix to run as good as possible?
[02:16] <dr_willis> goddard:  buy a roku? ;)
[02:16] <MeanEYE> rbnswartz: Log in to launchpad and post to that bug.
[02:16] <jay__> MeanEye: cheers
[02:16] <jay__> MeanEye: all working!
[02:16] <dr_willis> the wine/browser/netflix will take up 10x resources then  your window manager i bet.
[02:17] <MeanEYE> jay__: Glad it's working. Do note that Chrome doesn't need a plugin, but firefox does. :D
[02:17] <rbnswartz> MeanEYE besides that. Is there anything else that can be done?
[02:17] <goddard> dr_willis, i thought about it, but i already have this system and it has a lot of space so i can also upload my dvds to it
[02:17] <jay__> MeanEye: Got it
[02:17] <MeanEYE> rbnswartz: Contacting developers. Email or finding them here.
[02:17] <dr_willis> goddard:  what does that have to do with netflix then? ;)
[02:17] <jay__> Whats a good ubuntu theme for working.
[02:17] <dr_willis> roku can play files froma pc.
[02:18] <goddard> dr_willis, haha nothing but it is one thing im thinking about
[02:18] <jay__> As is research/word procesing etc..
[02:18] <dr_willis> theres other media-center gizmos out also
[02:18] <MeanEYE> jay__: That's a weird question. I like stock Ambiance, and Radiance. But Zukitwo Dark is <3
[02:18] <dr_willis> jay__:  just get to work and stop playing with themes ... ;)
[02:18] <goddard> dr_willis, i prefer having access to use my 52" tv as a computer/media system
[02:19] <jay__> dr_willis: I agree
[02:19] <dr_willis> goddard:  my tv does netflix ;)  and plays files from my pc/upnp server
[02:19] <Transhumanist> roku boxes is very closed down and proprietary isn't it? Doesn't seem like a good recommendation
[02:19] <goddard> dr_willis, i am talking to you right now from my couch.
[02:19] <jay__> But i dont like the app bar on the left
[02:19] <Transhumanist> same, goddard. high five!
[02:19] <goddard> :D
[02:19] <dr_willis> roku does netflix well and is cheap and fairly idiot proof
[02:19] <MeanEYE> jay__: It's called launcher. And there'sn othing you can do about it.
[02:20] <dr_willis> vs running netflix in a browser running wine on a pc thats laggy
[02:20] <MeanEYE> If we are talking about Unity
[02:20] <goddard> dr_willis, yeah your right
[02:20] <goddard> dr_willis, but its the best for people that like to also run linux
[02:20] <dr_willis> i bought a xios android settop box today. will see if it does netflix later
[02:20] <jay__> MeanEye: http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/07/a-list-of-best-15-ubuntu-1204-themes.html
[02:20] <Transhumanist> goddard: http://lifehacker.com/5963726/netflix-finally-comes-to-ubuntu-in-the-form-of-an-unofficial-desktop-app
[02:20] <jay__> Whats this?
[02:21] <MeanEYE> jay__: list fo themes.
[02:21] <Transhumanist> that might be worth trying, goddard.
[02:21] <MeanEYE> jay__: zukitwo I mentioned is there as well. I suggest that one.
[02:21] <dr_willis> netflix on ubuntu, runs in wine, running firefox, and can be very laggy.
[02:21] <dr_willis> it does cartoons ok ;) fromwhay i see
[02:21] <Transhumanist> it's still Wine, but it's a pre-built package. you might find it less buggy
[02:21] <goddard> Transfusion, im using that right now, but fullscreen movies get kinda slow and jerky
[02:21] <goddard> Transhumanist, ^
[02:22] <Transhumanist> fair enough
[02:22] <dr_willis> goddard:  its poffible ussing a minimal wm may help. but i doubt it
[02:22] <goddard> im thinking maybe i need a new video card
[02:22] <goddard> i got this system for 300 bucks
[02:22] <Transhumanist> it could be your graphics driver, too
[02:22] <dr_willis> ive heard its laggy  on very high end sytems also
[02:23] <goddard> dr_willis, it runs nice on my i7 with Nvidia GPU
[02:23] <goddard> dr_willis, but that is my laptop haha
[02:24] <dr_willis> goddard:  cartoons run well for me.. kids watch dora. ;)
[02:24] <dr_willis> not really tried more
[02:26] <psychopathic> i love ubuntu.
[02:26] <MeanEYE> psychopathic: Good!
[02:26] <atlef> good for you
[02:26] <Transhumanist> It's fantastic.
[02:26] <atlef> :-)
[02:26] <psychopathic> it works perfectly.
[02:27] <F3Speech> it works as well as the user :)
[02:27] <goddard> its gotta be the GPU cause my memory and CPU aren't maxed out
[02:27] <Transhumanist> what's the GPU?
[02:27] <goddard> Transhumanist, i think it is an intergrated ati but let me check
[02:28] <Haematoma> I'm setting up SSH,
=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[02:28] <Haematoma> Server is ran on ubuntu machine, client is on Macbook Pro
[02:28] <Haematoma> I set up key based authentication, but I'm not sure what files to copy over to the mac so I can login.
[02:29] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: .pub goes on server, private key stays on client.
[02:29] <Haematoma> ok,
[02:29] <Haematoma> I generated the key using the server, will that be an issue?
[02:29] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: No. It's okay.
[02:29] <Haematoma> I copied id_rsa to a flash drive, and then over to my mac
[02:29] <goddard> Transhumanist, VGA compatible controller: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Wrestler [Radeon HD 6320] (prog-if 00 [VGA controller])
[02:30] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: you can copy them anywhere you like. You can also reuse them on more than one machine.
[02:30] <Haematoma> mmk
[02:30] <jay__> how do i delete a file on usb?
[02:30] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: Do you know how they are used/configured?
[02:30] <Haematoma> I do not.
[02:30] <jay__> there is no 'move to recycle bin'
[02:30] <Haematoma> I assume i move the key to my mac home user folder
[02:31] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: Not really. Am not sure where on mac it is, but you can specify key when loggin in.
[02:31] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: Did you configure server?
[02:31] <Haematoma> so something like "cp SOURCE $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
[02:31] <Haematoma> kk
[02:31] <Haematoma> I configured the server using the follow guide:
[02:31] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: yes, it's probably .ssh (it is on linux).
[02:31] <Transhumanist> goddard: using the OSS driver or proprietary?
[02:32] <Haematoma> http://blog.agdunn.net/?p=54
[02:32] <MeanEYE> jay__: trash? or delete? Which program. You need to be more specific.
[02:32] <Transhumanist> whichever one you're using, couldn't hurt to try switching to the other and testing netflix to see if it's better or worse
[02:32] <goddard> Transhumanist, using the one i got with jockey
[02:32] <Transhumanist> jockey???
[02:32] <goddard> that additional drivers program in settings
[02:32] <goddard> it was called jockey once upon a time
[02:33] <Transhumanist> have you tried the the other driver listed there? probably the OSS one. Can't see it improving things, but I've pleasantly surprised myself in this manner many times before
[02:33] <jay__> delete and iso file
[02:33] <jay__> an
[02:33] <jay__> on usb
[02:33] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: Okay, looks reasonable. So on server, each user has .ssh/authorized_keys file which is basically .pub part of the keys.
[02:33] <jay__> any easy way of placing a bootable iso on usb?
[02:33] <jay__> windows 8/7 to be exact
[02:33] <jay__> from ubuntu
[02:34] <jay__> otherwise have to transfer iso to windows and use yumi
[02:34] <Haematoma> ahh, so I will need to add my pub key to each allowed user's .ssh/authorized_keys file
[02:34] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: So, if it's located in /home/test/.ssh/authorized keys, that key will work only for user "test".
[02:34] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: yes.
[02:34] <Haematoma> mmk
[02:34] <Haematoma> I'll check, thank you.
[02:34] <Haematoma> one moment
[02:34] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: When you are logging in from your mac, you do "ssh -i id_rsa_whatever user@server"
[02:35] <goddard> Transhumanist, ill give that a go see what happens
[02:35] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: Generally speaking you can skip specifying keyfile and then system will try all available until it finds a matching one. This can be a problem if you have try limit smaller than number of keys.
[02:35] <goddard> Transhumanist, also gonna try lxde
[02:36] <Haematoma> ok, I double checked to make sure that authorized had pub keys by perofrming the following action:
[02:36] <dr_willis> jay__:  ive heard you can dd the iso straight to the flash
[02:37] <dr_willis> jay__:  some of the tools at the pendrivelinux site may support that job also
[02:37] <Haematoma> from home direction, cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
[02:37] <Transhumanist> jay: a quick google revelead this: http://www.webupd8.org/2010/10/create-bootable-windows-7-usb-drive.html
[02:37] <wbf> Okay everyone so I try to manually start X and it says I have NO xorg.conf
[02:37] <Transhumanist> might be worth a look
[02:37] <Haematoma> directory*
[02:37] <wbf> I swear I put one there
[02:37] <dr_willis> wbf:  i dont need a xorg.conf ;) normally
[02:38] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: authorized_keys is on server.
[02:38] <wbf> dr_willis: I am using a kind of weird graphics card based on arm called the Mali 400 GPU
[02:38] <Haematoma> yes
[02:38] <wbf> dr_willis: I need an xorg.conf for hdmi cause that's it's only output
[02:38] <Transhumanist> oh god, Mali 400
[02:39] <dr_willis> wbf:  so ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf shows?
[02:39] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: Word of advice, don't leave private key on the server itself.
[02:39] <Haematoma> MeanEYE: any particular reason?
[02:39] <wbf> dr_willis: Nope, How did it dissapear?
[02:39] <Haematoma> MeanEYE: physical access/
[02:39] <Haematoma> ?*
[02:39] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: yes.
[02:39] <dr_willis> wbf:  first guess.. you did a typo.
[02:40] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: public part of the key can't be generated without private.
[02:40] <dr_willis> wbf:  its not like x removes it.
[02:40] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: and the other way around. If  you want security, keep them separate.
[02:40] <Haematoma> do i need to chmod my authorized_keys file?
[02:40] <wbf> dr_willis: I need you to build me an xorg.conf.
[02:40] <Haematoma> ok, will do
[02:41] <Haematoma> i'm looking at permissions and all i see is read and write
[02:41] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: yes, they need to be u=rw, none for others.
[02:41] <dr_willis> wbf:  ive not had to use an xorg.conf in several years
[02:41] <wbf> Who can build me an xorg.conf for HDMI for the mali 400?
[02:41] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: As in only user needs to have only read and write. Both user and group need to be set up for user that is logging in.
[02:41] <wbf> So far I've gotten to the commandline
[02:41] <wbf> which is a good sign
[02:42] <dr_willis> wbf:  i would say hit up google and find one allready made
[02:42] <Haematoma> my server is listening on 192.168.1.0
[02:42] <Haematoma> I'm assuming that is the router?
[02:42] <MeanEYE> wbf: Xorg detects settings on its own, so just instruct him to load the right driver.
[02:42] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: ip address can't end with 0. So it's nothing :D It's probably 192.168.0.1
[02:42] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: And yes, probably router.
[02:42] <Haematoma> ahhh
[02:43] <Haematoma> address should be same as gateway address if I want it to only listening to forwarded ports
[02:43] <wbf> MeanEYE: I'm saying I need an xorg.conf BUILT for me cause I really don't wanna mess up my device any more then it already is, as in no typos.
[02:43] <Haematoma> my bad, I assumed 192.168.1.0 was ALL adresses from xx.xx...0-999
[02:44] <Transhumanist> 0 to 255
[02:44] <Haematoma> >.<, yeah
[02:44] <Haematoma> doh!
[02:44] <MeanEYE> wbf: I've never used that GPU, sorry. Perhaps someone with experience can.
[02:44] <dr_willis> wbf:  its not like a messed xorg.conf will blow up the pc
[02:44] <Transhumanist> or not. minus 0.
[02:44] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: Depends on your netmask. :)
[02:44] <dr_willis> at least not these days. ;)
[02:45] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: netmask will tell you what is a network IP and what is broadcast.
[02:45] <wbf> dr_willis: It's not a PC. It's an android stick.
[02:47] <MeanEYE> wbf: Only thing I could find was this: http://linux-sunxi.org/Mali400#Lima_open_source_Mali_driver
[02:47] <Haematoma> what ip should I put if I want to listen for all internal IP addresses?
[02:47] <MeanEYE> It's not a configuration, but might give you some insight.
[02:48] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: You mean in sshd config/
[02:48] <wbf> MeanEYE: I already have a driver, I just need an xorg.config. THAT's all
[02:48] <MeanEYE> wbf: Ah, okay. Sorry I never played with that gpu.
[02:48] <Transhumanist> I'm not sure we can help. :)
[02:49] <Haematoma> MeanEYE: yes, I'm wondering which listening IP I should set.
[02:49] <TheLordOfTime> Haematoma, what internal IP ranges are you using?  192.168.1.x or 10.0.0.x or... ?
[02:50] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: That IP is used to tell SSHd on which interface (network card) to listen. Ommiting that in config will default to listening on all interfaces. So, I'd leave it out. Chances are you don't have 2 networks.
[02:50] <Haematoma> ahhh
[02:50] <TheLordOfTime> Haematoma, i'd agree with MeanEYE, filter connections at the firewall
[02:50] <wbf> MeanEYE: Just give me a standard XORG.conf for hdmi that you think might work
[02:50] <MeanEYE> wbf: do you know the driver name?
[02:50] <TheLordOfTime> Haematoma, at the firewall, you can configure what IP range(s) can actually access whatever port or what not
[02:50] <Haematoma> TheLordOfTime: I'm using 192.168.1.x
[02:50] <wbf> MeanEYE: No but I tried a default that was altered and I think the default will work
[02:51] <wbf> MeanEYE: so just try a default xorg.conf for hdmi
[02:52] <Haematoma> TheLordOfTime: If I'm using 192.168.1.x configuration, what should I set my listen address to?
[02:52] <TheLordOfTime> Haematoma, leave it blank, as MeanEYE said
[02:52] <TheLordOfTime> Haematoma, if you're not running two networks, you don't change the bind port.
[02:52] <TheLordOfTime> s/bind port/listen address/
[02:52] <TheLordOfTime> Haematoma, i would suggest that you do the IP filtering at the firewall level, not at the SSHd level.
[02:53] <TheLordOfTime> i can help with that if need be
[02:53] <MeanEYE> wbf: okay, but am not sure it will work. Here it is: http://pastebin.com/Fq1ue1Ha
[02:54] <wbf> MeanEYE: it's worth a shot ;)
[02:54] <MeanEYE> Certainly.
[02:54] <MeanEYE> wbf: also, you can freely remove "Files" section.
[02:54] <Haematoma> Ok, it's working now. Thanks!
[02:54] <MeanEYE> You are welcome.
[02:55] <wbf> MeanEYE: the xorg wiki is down that's why I'm asking
[02:55] <MeanEYE> wbf: Okay :D I just gave you my "intel" config file.
[02:56] <wbf> MeanEYE: another day another "sudo nautilus"
[02:56] <MeanEYE> wbf: Dear Linus Torvalds... why on earth would you do that?
[02:57] <wbf> MeanEYE: sorry about that... my xchat lagged out or I accidentally closed the window
[02:58] <MeanEYE> No need to be sorry.
=== razer is now known as cray0000
[03:00] <Haematoma> MeanEYE: are there any security vulnerabilities in an SSH server with keyauthentication that I should know about?
[03:00] <MeanEYE> Haematoma: No. Safest thing evar. I usually set that up and disable password auth.
[03:00] <Haematoma> MeanEYE: my installation and configuration was done using the most recent repositories
[03:00] <Haematoma> MeanEYE: kk, thank you for your help!
[03:00] <MeanEYE> Keys are never exchanged over network, and connection is encrypted.
[03:01] <MeanEYE> Linux is no joke when it comes to security :D
[03:01] <Haematoma> Plenty of documentation, too1
[03:01] <MeanEYE> And friendly folks. :D
[03:01] <MeanEYE> All for free.
[03:03] <Transhumanist> Unless you're on #arch. ;) I kid. Sort of.
[03:03] <MeanEYE> Heh
[03:05] <convict> I have proxmox with an ubuntu VM setup using virtio networking drivers and I can't get networking to work although everything is setup right and should be working.
[03:06] <convict> is something with virtio drivers broken?
[03:09] <hero616> This page is about "what is free software": http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html It is written in Chinese and there is no choice to read it in English. I think it's because of my IP address, can anyone send me a link of English version?
[03:11] <MeanEYE> THewre's a language selection on top. Can't you use that?
[03:11] <hero616> No, some page have but that page don't.
[03:12] <MeanEYE> Do you need just text?
[03:14] <MeanEYE> http://pastebin.com/eeEE3TCF
[03:15] <axisys> how to convert xml to pdf ? (asked on -offtopic as well)
[03:16] <MeanEYE> XML to PDF?
[03:16] <MeanEYE> What kind of XML?
[03:16] <hero616> I have tried append .en and it work. The Chinese version gives no choice to switch to other language version. It's not freedom.
[03:16] <MeanEYE> hero616: http://pastebin.com/eeEE3TCF
[03:17] <hero616> MeanEYE: Thanks.
[03:17] <axisys> MeanEYE: safari book online
[03:17] <MeanEYE> You are welcome.
[03:17] <MeanEYE> axisys: Hm, you could print to PDF?
[03:17] <axisys> MeanEYE: that will take forever for 200 pages
[03:18] <MeanEYE> axisys: Doubt. Besides, :D it's not like you are cutting wood. Computer is doing the hard work.
[03:18] <axisys> MeanEYE: i can get url for each page in xml using wget
[03:18] <MeanEYE> o_0
[03:19] <MeanEYE> URL?
[03:19] <MeanEYE> Is it a website?
[03:19] <axisys> MeanEYE: safari book online? yes
[03:19] <MeanEYE> That's the title "Safari Book Online"?
[03:19] <axisys> safaribooksonline.com
[03:20] <mistertwig> o my
[03:20] <mistertwig> hello friends!
[03:20] <MeanEYE> Ah, so you are trying to download a book they otherwise sell?
[03:20] <axisys> MeanEYE: you need an account to read
[03:20] <axisys> MeanEYE: I have monthly subscription
[03:21] <MeanEYE> Am guessing they consider it leasing, not selling.
[03:21] <axisys> MeanEYE: they give you tokens to download the book
[03:21] <MeanEYE> Hm, so, in which format do you download it?
[03:21] <axisys> once you accumulate enough tokens you can download a book..
[03:22] <axisys> MeanEYE: it gives you epub/mobi/pdf
[03:22] <axisys> as options
[03:22] <MeanEYE> What's the name of the book?
[03:22] <axisys> MeanEYE: Building Wireless Sensor Networks
[03:22] <Transhumanist> Arduino?
[03:23] <jon___> hi, an ubuntu install on a headless machine is no longer reachable.  The switch it is connected to doesn't show it is connected (yes, tried known working cables).  Is it possible that this is a software issue (bad driver on the ethernet port?) or is the ethernet jack on the headless machine blown?
[03:23] <Transhumanist> ZigBee?
[03:23] <axisys> Transhumanist: arduino/xbee/zigbee
[03:23] <Transhumanist> yeah I've got it
[03:23] <axisys> i need to wait another month to get enough tokens.. i want to print it now
[03:23] <MeanEYE> axisys: I probably shouldn't be doing this. http://www.rfdh.com/ez/system/db/lib_jnl/upload/3521/1129454260/[MWRF0509]_Building_Wireless_Sensor_Networks.pdf
[03:24] <dr_willis> books on paper? how quaint
[03:24] <MeanEYE> jon___: could be a number of things.
[03:24] <Transhumanist> Just be aware that in that box, he likes to do things from scratch a lot. But often you can by prebuilt modules for things
[03:24] <axisys> MeanEYE: i am not planning to click it.. sorry :-(
[03:24] <MeanEYE> Okay then. I can't help you otherwise.
[03:24] <pierre___> hello
[03:24] <Transhumanist> for instance, if you don't want to solder, you can buy the ZigBee shields from the Arduino store
[03:25] <axisys> i really like to find a way to xml to pdf
[03:25] <Transhumanist> xml isn't a viewable document. it's more like a config file.
[03:25] <Fonsie> meanEYE: i typed in what you told me and it gave me a "fatal server error"
[03:25] <axisys> Transhumanist: shouldnt there be a way to convert it to pdf then?
[03:25] <Fonsie> then said under that "no screens found"
[03:26] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: can you remind me what the problem was, I have a gold-fish-memory.
[03:26] <Fonsie> also said "xinit: unable to connect to xserver
[03:26] <jon___> couldn't you open the xml in a text editor and print to a pdf printer?
[03:26] <Transhumanist> axisys: sure, open it in your favourite document viewer and click save as pdf
[03:27] <Fonsie> installed lubuntu and when trying to boot it i get a command prompt
[03:27] <Transhumanist> it didn't fully install then, Fonsie
[03:27] <axisys> Transhumanist: xml to pdf will look like as if I printed it
[03:27] <Fonsie> and when i type in startx it scrolls through a bunch of text then stop with that error i just listed
[03:27] <Transhumanist> axisys: exactly
[03:27] <axisys> Transhumanist: do not want to read actual xml file.
[03:27] <Transhumanist> xml is NOT a document. Each app will process the XML file differently
[03:27] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  but sudo service lightdm works correctly?
[03:27] <axisys> Transhumanist: what viewer will let me read it?
[03:27] <jon___> got a question. I did an ubuntu install on a headless machine and it is no longer reachable.  The switch it is connected to doesn't show it is connected (yes, tried known working cables).  Is it possible that this is a software issue (bad driver on the ethernet port?) or is the ethernet jack on the headless machine blown?
[03:27] <Transhumanist> do you mean HTML?
[03:28] <Fonsie> idk, im not very good at all this
[03:28] <Fonsie> and dont know command prompts at all
[03:28] <axisys> Transhumanist: what app can I use to view xml file?
[03:28] <Transhumanist> You can't.
[03:28] <Transhumanist> It's not a document.
[03:28] <dr_willis> jon___:  could be either one.  but its rare that a wired nic has driver issues
[03:28] <Transhumanist> You can open the xml file in any text editor
[03:28] <axisys> 22:27:53 < Transhumanist> axisys: sure, open it in your favourite document  viewer and click save as pdf
[03:28] <UmBsublime> just open it as a text file
[03:28] <UmBsublime> vim filename
[03:29] <axisys> Transhumanist: ^
[03:29] <UmBsublime> or nano maybe
[03:29] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  try the command ' sudo service lightdm start'     does it work correctly?
[03:29] <MeanEYE> He's actually talking about xhtml, I think.
[03:29] <UmBsublime> what does it mather?
[03:29] <Transhumanist> I think we're misunderstanding eachother. XML files are like source code or config files. They are just words and characters. You save them to PDF as you do any other text file.
[03:29] <MeanEYE> It doesn't.
[03:29] <jon___> dr willis: thanks.
[03:29] <Fonsie> meanEYE: also, i typed in "/var/log/Xorg.0.log" and says permission denied
[03:30] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: that's not a command it's a file. So you cat it or something like that.
[03:30] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  because thats a file you read. not a command you run
[03:30] <Transhumanist> XML is different to HTML and XHTML.
[03:30] <MeanEYE> Transhumanist: You think!? :P
[03:30] <Fonsie> ill try cat first then
[03:31] <Transhumanist> I don't know if axisys knows the difference, that's all MeanEYE :p
[03:31] <Fonsie> so i should type "cat "/var/log/Xorg.0.log""?
[03:31] <docmur> Does anyone have any idea how to actually point serviio to folder so it can find video's, the android app doesn't work as it wont actually add the files to the server and I can't find any guide on how do to it.
[03:31] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: no need for quotes.
[03:31] <dr_willis> !info serviio
[03:31] <axisys> Transhumanist: yep.. I did not know the difference until now
[03:32] <ubottu> Package serviio does not exist in quantal
[03:32] <axisys> http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd this is in the top of the file
[03:32] <Fonsie> and the other one doesnt have anything in it? just sudo service lightdm start?
[03:32] <axisys> <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
[03:32] <axisys> more like this ^
[03:33] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  ' sudo service lightdm start'   no quotes needed
[03:33] <Transhumanist> axisys: do you have a link to the XHTML file?
[03:33] <Transhumanist> because if so, just paste it into your web browser
[03:33] <Transhumanist> in the URL field
[03:33] <Transhumanist> that should view it
[03:34] <kslater> is there an easy tweak to change the location of the minimize/maximize/restore buttons on the window border?
[03:34] <Transhumanist> otherwise, point your web browser to the XHTML file location, also in the URL bar
[03:34] <dr_willis> !controls
[03:34] <ubottu> Starting in Lucid, the minimize, maximize, and close buttons have been moved to the left side. For more information and workarounds, please see http://pad.lv/532633
[03:34] <kslater> I keep looking to the top right (muscle memory)
[03:34] <kslater> thanks ubottu
[03:34] <Transhumanist> it passes after a week or two, kslater :p
[03:34] <dr_willis> kslater:  theres teeaks to move them
[03:34] <dr_willis> but fullscreen apps still have it on the left
[03:35] <kslater> it's all about the themes. Should have figured
[03:35] <dr_willis> themes can define which side to put them on
[03:35] <axisys>  wget --http-user=myusername --http-password="secret" http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/networking/wireless/780596807757/xbee-api-protocol/118 got me page 118
[03:35] <axisys> Transhumanist: ^
[03:35] <dr_willis> thye run some command that tweaks the setting
[03:35] <axisys> Transhumanist: then google-chrome 118 did not work out
[03:36] <Transhumanist> I don't understand what you're trying to do. Can you explain it?
[03:37] <MeanEYE> Transhumanist: he reads books on that site, and he wants to download and print the book.
[03:38] <Transhumanist> That could involve a fair bit of coding, depending on how the site serves the book :)
[03:38] <Transhumanist> They'll likely try to prevent that
[03:38] <kslater> that was easy ->  gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout --type string "menu:minimize,maximize,close"
[03:38] <kslater> and I can always unset them and go back
[03:38] <eagernewb> Kay, I have a really dumb question.
[03:38] <MeanEYE> eagernewb: Shoot.
[03:39] <MeanEYE> We like eager newbs :P
[03:39] <axisys> Transhumanist: they let you download using tokens or regular print button on the page
[03:39] <eagernewb> I am installing Ubuntu on a computer, I think there are a few different hard drives in it... I have a few options of where to install it.
[03:39] <eagernewb> One is n 80gig drive, another is 82.3, another is 40gig.
[03:39] <marz> How can I install my Ethernet driver. I'm using Ubuntu 12.10
[03:39] <eagernewb> Does this matter?
[03:39] <axisys> Transhumanist: but I have wait to get few more tokens to download the book.. i want to print it now
[03:40] <Transhumanist> axisys: probably best to ask in a channel on web development or similar.
[03:40] <MeanEYE> eagernewb: Nope. After installation completes, you just decide where to install boot loader. Other than that, Linux can be installed on pretty much anything.
[03:40] <axisys> Transhumanist: gotcah.. any channel you recom?
[03:40] <axisys> gotcha*
[03:40] <eagernewb> So I will have access to all the roughly 200gigs in there?
[03:40] <Transhumanist> I dunno sorry. It's been a while since I did that sort of stuff. But again, since they require tokens, they've probably tried to prevent people just bypassing it by going through their source code.
[03:41] <eagernewb> Another thing: the first option, the 80gig, it says I will overwrite 1 partition, but the other two, it says I'll overwrite 2 partitions.
[03:41] <MeanEYE> eagernewb: Yes, Linux supports Windows file systems. But Linux will need partition to be installed on.
[03:41] <MeanEYE> eagernewb: You can manually configure everything. Even resize existing partitions and loose no data.
[03:41] <eagernewb> Okay.
[03:41] <eagernewb> Thanks!
[03:42] <Transhumanist> Ubuntu can resize existing partitions (split into two) if you have no free partitions. This doesn't cause any damage to the existing data and installs, but a backup is always recommended when modifying partitions
[03:42] <MeanEYE> eagernewb: You are welcome. If you are unsure of something, ask here, and we'll help.
[03:42] <MeanEYE> Better than loosing your data. :D
[03:42] <marz> my laptop that I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 is not recognizing my wired network
[03:42] <marz> how can I manually install the Ethernet port driver?
[03:43] <kvothetech> marz: does it see your card?  you install drivers usually by modprobing the driver
[03:43] <MeanEYE> marz: Are you sure it's not being recognized? Does "lspci" include it?
[03:43] <Transhumanist> there may be a reason it didn't install the Ethernet driver
[03:43] <kvothetech> or kernel mod
[03:43] <Transhumanist> (i.e. it doesn't know of a working one)
[03:43] <Transhumanist> but that'd be rare
[03:43] <marz> MeanEYE: Yeah, lspci includes it in the list
[03:43] <MeanEYE> marz: You don't need the driver. Just to configure it.
[03:43] <marz> kvothetech: I'm quite new to Linux i don't understand modprobing. I'm sorry
[03:44] <kvothetech> marz: modprobe <mod>
[03:44] <marz> MeanEYE: Can you give me a step-by-step solution on how will I configure it
[03:44] <cfhowlett> marz: no apologies required.  We all  started at "noob" level.
[03:44] <kvothetech> marz: ifconfig <addr> netmask <subnet>
[03:44] <MeanEYE> marz: Hm, first explain how you will use this. Is it a laptop ?
[03:45] <kvothetech> marz: route add default gw <gateway> then add your nameservers to /etc/resolv.conf
[03:45] <marz> kvothetech: I tried typing in mod on the terminal. It give me the error "The program 'mod' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing: sudo apt-get install monodoc-base"
[03:45] <marz> <MeanEYE: Yeah, it's a laptop. Lenovo G480
[03:46] <MeanEYE> Unity?
[03:46] <MeanEYE> marz: I mean, default Ubuntu desktop?
[03:46] <marz> yeah
[03:46] <marz> MeanEYE: Yes, I haven't touched or changed anything yet
[03:46] <MeanEYE> marz: So, network manager should do the trick.
[03:46] <marz> How do I do that?
[03:47] <Transhumanist> System Settings -> Networks
[03:47] <Transhumanist> use the GUI, not terminal for this
[03:47] <MeanEYE> I think someone else can take it from here. It's been a while since I used default interface. :D
[03:47] <marz> Transhumanist: I'm there
[03:47] <Dap> i'm trying to get lubuntu12.10-amd64 running off of a usb stick; everything works out-of-the-box when running from cd, but when running off the stick(installed via unetbootin), wireless and my trackpad don't work. any ideas?
[03:48] <marz> MeanEYE, sorry for the trouble.
[03:48] <Transhumanist> Well, I don't know where you were going. It sounds like a driver issue, but you suggest otherwise. Sorry MeanEYE, back to you. :p
[03:48] <MeanEYE> marz: not a trouble at all. I just didn't use default stuff for a while now so it's best if I don't give wrong information.
[03:49] <marz> MeanEYE: What am I supposed to do now?
[03:49] <MeanEYE> Transhumanist: what sounds like a driver issue?
[03:50] <MeanEYE> marz: can you go to paste.ubuntu.com and give me the output of lspci?
[03:50] <Transhumanist> Maybe try this marz: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.10/ubuntu-help/net-manual.html
[03:51] <marz> MeanEYE: I can't get to the Internet using my laptop. I'm currently using my desktop WIndows XP for this current session
[03:51] <MeanEYE> Okay.
[03:51] <marz> MeanEYE: But its ok, i'll just type it all in here
[03:51] <MeanEYE> marz: No need. I just need stuff with network in its name.
[03:52] <Transhumanist> just out of curiosity, I presume ifconfig shows no IP address?
[03:52] <Transhumanist> (for eth0)
[03:52] <MeanEYE> Is ifconfig still installed by default?
[03:52] <Transhumanist> yep
[03:54] <marz> MeanEYE: So what information do you need?
[03:54] <marz> Transhumanist: I can't save it, the save button is greyed out
[03:54] <UmBsublime> ifconfig was always installed by default all on distros of linux i tried
[03:55] <MeanEYE> marz: lspci | grep Ethernet
[03:55] <MeanEYE> UmBsublime: it's been deprecated. And am not following.
[03:55] <UmBsublime> ?
[03:56] <marz> Ethernet controller: Atheros Communications Inc, Ar8162 Fast Ethernet (rev 10)
[03:56] <MeanEYE> marz: Sounds like wireless.
[03:56] <Transhumanist> MeanEYE: deprecated by what?
[03:56] <MeanEYE> Transhumanist: it's not to be used anymore, we should use "ip"
[03:57] <kostkon> MeanEYE, ?
[03:57] <marz> MeanEYE: I can use the port when i boot up in Windows
[03:57] <MeanEYE> marz: Do you still have windows ?
[03:57] <marz> Yup
[03:57] <Transhumanist> so, what, ifconfig no flags = ip link?
[03:58] <marz> I'm using a dual boot
[03:58] <MeanEYE> marz: Can you please boot, go to Device Manager and tell me which network adapters you have installed there.
[03:59] <MeanEYE> Transhumanist: I guess. :D Didn't get into it. It's quite a nice tool.
[03:59] <marz> MeanEYE: ok. hold on a sec
[03:59] <MeanEYE> Well, it's not like we are not suppose to use ifconfig, but they are replacing it with that slowly.
[04:00] <MeanEYE> Just so you don't get surprised one day. :D
[04:00] <Transhumanist> ok
=== bazhang_ is now known as bazhang
[04:01] <pierre___> I've got a problem : I compiled a program, and it complains about a missing lib wich is present ldd says "libbgdrtm.so => not found" ... I think it has something to do with ld but can't figure out what. Maybe manually re-linking the lib with the binary ?
[04:02] <pierre___> can somebody help me ?
[04:02] <marz> MeanEYE: Atheros AR8162/8166/8168 PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.20)
[04:02] <MeanEYE> pierre___: Which program.
[04:02] <MeanEYE> marz: Just that one?
[04:02] <pierre___> MeanEYE: bennugd
[04:02] <Gachnar> ##vieux-gars
[04:02] <marz> MeanEYE: There is also Broadcom 802.11n Network Adapter as well as 2 Bluetooth device
[04:03] <pierre___> MeanEYE: it's a game engine, it has many ports but lacks raspberry pi, so I compiled it myself
[04:03] <MeanEYE> marz: Okay. So network card is there. Linux sees it, and just needs configuring.
[04:03] <marz> Yey, so how do I do it?
[04:04] <marz> MeanEYE: How do I do it? hehe
[04:04] <MeanEYE> Are you still in windows?
[04:04]  * cfhowlett Broadcom ... *shudders*
[04:04] <marz> MeanEYE: Yes
[04:04] <Transhumanist> yeah Broadcom is horrible
[04:04] <Transhumanist> good for routers far from the exchange, though
[04:05] <MeanEYE> marz: Do you know how to get IP address, gateway and netmask?
[04:05] <marz> Yeah, ipconfig right?
[04:05] <MeanEYE> Yup.
[04:05] <marz> cmd > ipconfig/all
[04:05] <MeanEYE> Give me that info.
[04:05] <Transhumanist> space between ipconfig and /all
[04:05] <doslove> hi
[04:06] <Transhumanist> Hallo
[04:06] <cfhowlett> doslove: greetings
[04:08] <b14d3> Hi guys, I'm having a repeated problem with Transmission crashing as soon as it loads, but don't have a whole lot information. Anyone have ideas?
[04:08] <marz> MeanEYE: 192.168.0.101                   192.168.0.1                  255.255.255.0
[04:08] <Transhumanist> Try Deluge or qBittorrent. I prefer Deluge anyway
[04:08] <MeanEYE> b14d3: try running it from command line.
[04:08] <MeanEYE> marz: okay, go now to linux.
[04:09] <pierre___> MeanEYE: sorry... my mistake some stupid LD_LIBRARY_PATH issue :/
[04:09] <shanbuntu> hi all.  i'd like to start developing for ubuntu mobile... i want to install the os on a cheap phone - any suggestions as to which model of phones i could get ?
[04:09] <MeanEYE> pierre___: no need to be sorry. Did you solve it?
[04:10] <MeanEYE> shanbuntu: no devices yet to my knowledge.
[04:10] <cfhowlett> shanbuntu: still to early to say as no OEM has yet partnered.
[04:10] <b14d3> Well I really have liked some features that I've used in Transmission.
[04:10] <Transhumanist> I believe I heard word that the Galaxy Nexus will be the first phone supported. But I can't be sure.
[04:10] <MeanEYE> b14d3: That's okay. But starting it from terminal window will probably give you more information.
[04:10] <marz> MeanEYE: ok i'm in linux now
[04:10] <shanbuntu> thanks MeanEye and cfhowlett.  so how are developers supposed to test out Ubuntu for mobile?
[04:10] <Transhumanist> Anyway, for now just develop in QML on the desktop, shanbuntu
[04:10] <MeanEYE> marz: Okay, open terminal window.
[04:10] <Transhumanist> that's what I will do soon
[04:10] <cfhowlett> shanbuntu: that said, try practicing your arts with the nexus phone
[04:10] <shanbuntu> (and Transhumanlist, thanks)
[04:10] <b14d3> MeanEYE: Alright, what info should I look for?
[04:11] <marz> done
[04:11] <cfhowlett> shanbuntu: virtualbox?
[04:11] <marz> MeanEYE: done
[04:11] <cfhowlett> shanbuntu: and, of course, watch  the developer threads
[04:11] <MeanEYE> b14d3: Just start terminal and type "transmission-gtk" and see what pops up.
[04:11] <pierre___> MeanEYE: yep :) it segfaults because he can't find any joystick, ugly but normal. I'm trying to run streets of rage remake on the rpi
[04:11] <Transhumanist> shanbuntu: they will announce a lot more info at CES in a few days
[04:11] <cfhowlett> shanbuntu: as well as #ubuntu-phone for this discussion
[04:11] <Transhumanist> so check back after the 11th of Jan
[04:11] <MeanEYE> marz: okay, ifconfig -a and then tell me if there's anything for eth0
[04:12] <Transhumanist> They will no doubt put out an emulator soon for development
[04:12] <eagernewb> Okay!
[04:12] <eagernewb> I have another question.
[04:12] <pierre___> MeanEYE: btw, thanks for paying me attention
[04:12] <cfhowlett> eagernewb: ask it.
[04:12] <MeanEYE> shanbuntu: No idea about that yet. Your guess is as good as mine. If SDK is out, they might have an emulator, but I doubt.
[04:12] <eagernewb> The power went out right after I started my Ubuntu install.
[04:13] <eagernewb> I was installing from USB.
[04:13] <MeanEYE> eagernewb: You have to restart installation.
[04:13] <cfhowlett> eagernewb: assume the install is beyond recover and reinstall.
[04:13] <b14d3> MeanEYE: Well the problem is that it loads fine, so loading it from the command line doesn't really tell me anything.
[04:13] <marz> MeanEYE: nope. there is none. Only lo and wlan0
[04:13] <eagernewb> Now, I have the error message "Verifying DMI pool data..."
[04:13] <MeanEYE> b14d3: when does it crash?
[04:13] <eagernewb> So I can't just not load from USB, I can't boot the hard drive.
[04:13] <b14d3> MeanEYE: Some point immediately after it loads. I can see some torrents that I have tried to start, but I can't do anything else.
[04:13] <MeanEYE> marz: So you have -> wlan0, lo
[04:14] <eagernewb> I am looking up this problem.
[04:14] <marz> MeanEYE: Yup
[04:14] <cfhowlett> eagernewb: the usb boots, right?
[04:14] <eagernewb> No.
[04:14] <MeanEYE> b14d3: did you try resetting config?
[04:14] <marz> MeanEYE: lo is for Link encap: Local Loopback
[04:14] <cfhowlett> eagernewb: wait the USB will NOT boot?
[04:14] <Transhumanist> b14d3: I respect trying to figure out what is wrong, but in the meantime, you've got good alternative torrent clients in Deluge and qBittorrent. Just for the record. =)
[04:14] <b14d3> MeanEYE: Nope, tried to find that and/or something to remove all the torrents I had loaded into it and I couldn't find it via google.
[04:14] <eagernewb> Nothing boots, unfortunately.
[04:14] <MeanEYE> marz: I know, am just confirming what interfaces you have. So it is a driver issue. You need to see which driver you have, find it and install it.
[04:15] <eagernewb> Maybe this is a hardware problem? Power surge or something?
[04:15] <Transhumanist> eagernewb: can you network boot?
[04:15] <shanbuntu> thanks for the VirtualBox tip
[04:15] <marz> MeanEYE: Uhhm, does it mean that I need to download it?
[04:15] <MeanEYE> b14d3: Anything important there? In things you downloaded?
[04:15] <cfhowlett> eagernewb: I'd suspect yes.  Power failure should NOT have scrambled a properly configured US
[04:15] <eagernewb> Not sure what that means? I can't get further than the BIOS/CMOS screen.
[04:15] <Transhumanist> maybe setup a PXE server and boot ploplinux and then try uUSB booting
[04:16] <b14d3> MeanEYE: As far as the torrents go? No, I have copies. Nothing should delete the actual data, should it?
[04:16] <Transhumanist> can you go into bios and see what boot options are available?
[04:16] <eagernewb> I will go look.
[04:16] <cfhowlett> eagernewb: if you can't even set the bios then you've got harwware issues.
[04:16] <MeanEYE> marz: Perhaps. If I remember you said you have broadcom. Check what drivers windows loads and try finding equivalent.
[04:16] <eagernewb> I CAN see the BIOS.
[04:16] <dcope> how does one go about installing https://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack
[04:16] <MeanEYE> b14d3: no just transmission settings.
[04:16] <eagernewb> But I can't get pas it.
[04:16] <dcope> after it is alreayd cloned
[04:16] <b14d3> MeanEYE: Oh, no.
[04:16] <Transhumanist> change the boot order in BIOS to prioritise network booting or PXE
[04:16] <MeanEYE> b14d3: so, to remove transmission settings do this "rm -Rf ~/.config/transmission"
[04:16] <MeanEYE> b14d3: see if that helps.
[04:16] <marz> MeanEYE: To be honest, I really don't know where to start. I'm a completely new to Ubuntu/Linux,
[04:17] <eagernewb> Thanks for help! I will go look and try to do these things. AFK.
[04:17] <marz> hahaha
[04:17] <Transhumanist> then on another computer setup tftp and ploplinux
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[04:17] <Transhumanist> eagernewb: I found the 'Serva' app on Windows pretty easy to work with
[04:17] <b14d3> MeanEYE: That's where the config file is -_-
[04:17] <MeanEYE> b14d3: All the stuff is there. Downloaded torrent files, settings, stuff like that.
[04:18] <b14d3> MeanEYE: You are completely my hero right now. Did exactly what I needed it to
[04:18] <MeanEYE> marz: Hm, let me try and dig up.
[04:18] <b14d3> MeanEYE: I really appreciate the help
[04:18] <MeanEYE> b14d3: did it work?
[04:18] <b14d3> MeanEYE: Sure did. Worst case scenario I lost a few easily reobtainable .torrent files, but I don't think I did
[04:19] <Enlight_uni> hi, on ubuntu, samba servers are not advertised through dns-sd even if smb is linked to avahi, does anybody knows why?
[04:19] <marz> MeanEYE: I installed Ubuntu to be my starting point in studying Linux. I really thought all of my laptop's drivers will automatically be installed along with the software.
[04:19] <MeanEYE> b14d3: I think you did, they are stored in ~/.config/transmission/torrents
[04:19] <eagernewb> Transhumanist: what would the networking option look like? Would it be LAN? I will look into Serva.
[04:19] <MeanEYE> marz: Yup. Unless you have broadcom. Sux to have hardware from a company that doesn't like open source.
[04:19] <RollinV2> marz, oh boy.. welcome to linux. get used to using the terminal and googling for solutions
[04:19] <Transhumanist> marz: they always are for me
[04:20] <MeanEYE> marz: Good news is, they do offer Linux drivers on their site. But you have to figure out which chip you have.
[04:20] <b14d3> MeanEYE: I had actually saved copies in a different location, so I probably lost the Transmission copies of it, which is completely not a big deal
[04:20] <dcope> why is it not possible to run ./configure in the xf86-input-mtrack source?
[04:20] <Transhumanist> but marz, hardware drivers are almost always closed-source. which means Linux people have to spend a long time reverse engineering them
[04:20] <Transhumanist> some hardware is worse than others
[04:20] <Transhumanist> Broadcom from memory has a poor reputation of working with Linux
[04:20] <RollinV2> marz, i'd say 90% of my hardware works on base install. but that remaining 10% is annoying to troubleshoot
[04:20] <MeanEYE> b14d3: When I say torrent files, I meant .torrent :D not the downloaded data itself. Sorry for not being clear.
[04:21] <Transhumanist> On almost all of my computers, everything has "just worked" out of the box, due to great OSS drivers, or working proprietary ones. But sometimes this isn't the case.
[04:21] <b14d3> MeanEYE: I understood exactly what you meant. I kept copies of the .torrent in a different location :)
[04:21] <MeanEYE> b14d3: okay then. No harm done. If this happens again, I suggest contacting transmission developers. They'll need a bug report on this.
[04:22] <Transhumanist> It's a sad situation because it's not Ubuntu or Linux's fault that your ethernet card doesn't work. It's Broadcoms fault for not bothering to support anything but Windows. But that doesn't help you get your ethernet working, so it matters little to you right now. Sorry. =/
[04:22] <Transhumanist> <eagernewb> Transhumanist: what would the networking option look like? Would it be LAN? I will look into Serva.
[04:22] <Transhumanist> yes
[04:22] <Enlight_uni> b14d3, trnsmission can be configured to either keep or delete .torrent files
[04:22] <Transhumanist> and let me grab a link for you to help out, because network booting is daunting at first
[04:23] <MeanEYE> marz: So, first you need to go to web site of you laptops manufacturer. Check which chip you have for your model exactly. Then we can help.
[04:24] <marz> MeanEYE: ok, just give me a moment.
[04:24] <marz> Transhumanist: Yeah, I know its not that easy. I'm basically a freeloader to those Linux guys. Hahahaha
[04:24] <marz> RollinV2: Good for you! Hehehe
[04:25] <NemNemo> Is there any easy way to download a verified good Ubuntu ISO off Usenet with an NZB?
[04:25] <MeanEYE> NemNemo: Torrents work.
[04:26] <NemNemo> ...
[04:26] <MeanEYE> I know it's not exactly the same.
[04:26] <marz> MeanEye: You mean lenovo?
[04:26] <Transhumanist> eagernewb: http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/500
[04:26] <MeanEYE> marz: Yes. Turn your laptop over, get the full product number and get the specs based on that.
[04:26] <RollinV2> NemNemo, why? you have torrents and the direct links...
[04:26] <NemNemo> I download at 2 MB/s from Usenet
[04:26] <cfhowlett> NemNemo: torrents or direct links.
[04:26] <Transhumanist> it's a bit hard to follow at times because he re-wrote it after losing his first version
[04:26] <Transhumanist> but ask me if you get stuck
[04:26] <UmBsublime> i get same form torrents
[04:26] <MeanEYE> NemNemo: Alternatively, you can md5 and download something and then just verify.
[04:27] <NemNemo> I do not.  And I don't have a torrent client installed either, because I don't use them
[04:27] <RollinV2> NemNemo, then you should be able to dl the direct link in less than 1 hour
[04:27] <marz> MeanEYE: YOu mean the serial number?
[04:27] <Transhumanist> eagernewb: where he gives links to ploplinux, I ignored those and went straight to the ploplinux site and downloaded the latst versions
[04:28] <NemNemo> Yes, I have 15 minutes left. But going forward, I'd rather download it in a way that doesn't use any of Canonical's bandwidth, and is fast for me.
[04:28] <eagernewb> Transhumanist: okay, cool! Thanks!
[04:28] <Transhumanist> You'll get stuck. So message me when you do.
[04:28] <NemNemo> I suspect the answer to my question is no
[04:28] <MeanEYE> marz: No, theres P/N (product number) and S/N. Product number is what you need.
[04:28] <skooks> Hey guys, quick question.
[04:28] <MeanEYE> NemNemo: Wait.
[04:29] <marz> MeanEYE: Oh ok. Sorry about that
[04:29] <skooks> All I have are blank CDs but the latest Ubuntu distributions require a DVD.
[04:29] <Transhumanist> NemNemo: torrents are the best solution. using them is very simple. Install Deluge and then click on the torrent link on Ubuntu's website
[04:29] <cfhowlett> skooks: or a USB
[04:29] <skooks> I can't use USB.
[04:29] <skooks> Laptop is too old for that.
[04:29] <MeanEYE> marz: Sorry, it's ont he bottom of the laptop. There's a sticker.
[04:29] <NemNemo> If your laptop doesn't have USB, you shouldn't be using the latest version...
[04:29] <Transhumanist> that's not necessarily true
[04:29] <skooks> I mean it's too old for USB instalation.
[04:29] <skooks> Like, it'll only boot off CD/DVD.
[04:30] <cfhowlett> skooks: old laptop?  try lubuntu or xubuntu
[04:30] <skooks> It's not that old.
[04:30] <MeanEYE> NemNemo: Which Ubuntu you want to download?
[04:30] <skooks> It's like 2 years old, but it doesn't boot from USB for some reason.
[04:30] <NemNemo> Are you sure?  Never seen a computer that refused USB boot. Anyway, 12.04 LTE is a CD
[04:30] <Transhumanist> network booting would work, but I think the Ubuntu store has a CD installer
[04:30] <Transhumanist> lemme check
[04:30] <NemNemo> Install from CD, then Apt-get upgrade
[04:30] <NemNemo> Is that correct?
[04:30] <MeanEYE> NemNemo: so 12.04>?
[04:30] <Transhumanist> damn, the store only has a CD of Ubuntu Server
[04:31] <marz> MeanEYE: And where will I type my product number in?
[04:31] <Transhumanist> Nem: lots of computers don't USB boot
[04:31] <Transhumanist> Mac Mini, Toshiba Portege M200, for instance
[04:31] <MeanEYE> marz: Bottom of the laptop, there's a sticker that says P/N
[04:31] <Transhumanist> mostly older ones or Macs, but yeah
[04:31] <marz> MeanEYE: Yeah, I got it
[04:31] <skooks> So I can install an Ubuntu version that is like 9.x or what ever and then just apt-get upgrade and it'll go to 12.10?
[04:31] <NemNemo> I was disregarding Macs
[04:31] <Transhumanist> I don't recommend it
[04:31] <marz> MeanEYE: I went to lenovo.com and entered in on the search textbox
[04:31] <Transhumanist> Upgrading is flaky
[04:31] <NemNemo> I actually have a Mac that doesn't boot from USB
[04:31] <marz> MeanEYE: "no results found"
[04:32] <skooks> Well I don't want a network installer.
[04:32] <Transhumanist> skooks: you should burn the alternate installer to a CD
[04:32] <Transhumanist> it should fit
[04:32] <skooks> Seeing as I want a live CD.
[04:32] <MeanEYE> marz: okay, can you give me the full model name?
[04:32] <skooks> Which alternate installer? I tried finding it.
[04:32] <Transhumanist> oh, you want live?
[04:32] <NemNemo> I am downloading 10.04 LTE amd64 CD right now, and I assume the 32 bit one is a CD, too.
[04:32] <MeanEYE> NemNemo: Downloading from usenet?
[04:32] <skooks> There aren't 64bit CD versions?
[04:32] <Transhumanist> The alternate installer is not a live CD. But it will correctly install Ubuntu Desktop 12.10
[04:32] <marz> MeanEYE: Lenovo G480 Intel Core-i5
[04:32] <Transhumanist> Do you need to install Ubuntu or do you need a live environment?
[04:32] <skooks> Transhumanist, could you give a link to the alternate 12.10 CD?
[04:32] <Transhumanist> sure
[04:33] <skooks> Well I prefer a live environment.
[04:33] <skooks> But if worst comes to shove.
[04:33] <Transhumanist> Ubuntu alternate is a text-based GUI. It's actually still fairly user-friendly
[04:33] <skooks> I don't mind.
[04:33] <skooks> Enter enter enter, put some info in, enter enter install.
[04:33] <Transhumanist> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads
[04:34] <Transhumanist> the alternate so torrents are below the network boot links, but the size isn't listed
[04:34] <Transhumanist> I have them, so let me check
[04:34] <MeanEYE> marz: That's it? Aren't there more details.
[04:34] <NemNemo> Is there a decent PPC Ubuntu now?  I know last time I checked, there was a bit of transition oing on
[04:34] <skooks> Oh, the alternates are the torrents?
[04:34] <skooks> I thought those were just different means of downloading.
[04:34] <Transhumanist> skooks: http://askubuntu.com/questions/137588/ubuntu-12-04-image-size-732mb-will-it-fit-a-standard-cd
[04:35] <Transhumanist> skooks: there are torrents for ALL the Ubuntu ISO's
[04:35] <Transhumanist> they're good because they're faster than direct downloads and don't use Canonical bandwidth
[04:35] <UmBsublime> ^
[04:36] <MeanEYE> marz: Ouch. It's more complicated than I thought.
[04:36] <skooks> The alternate links are the same as the regulare ones.
[04:36] <skooks> I don't see a 12.10 that'll fit on a 700.
[04:36] <Transhumanist> Also, skooks: some background information (might be worth going with 12.04 if you need a burnable CD): http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/09/its-official-the-ubuntu-livecd-is-dead
[04:36] <skooks> 700 mb cd.
[04:36] <Dayofswords> does anyone know how to manually add screen resolutions to Ubuntu?
[04:36] <Transhumanist> no, I don't think 12.10 will fit
[04:36] <Transhumanist> 12.04 will though
[04:36] <skooks> Let's see then.
[04:36] <marz> MeanEYE: I can give you a printscreen of my device manager in Windows if you'd like
[04:36] <Transhumanist> 12.04 will be supported until 2017
[04:37] <skooks> Is upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 easy?
[04:37] <Transhumanist> it should be, since it's just one upgrade
[04:37] <Transhumanist> they're only 6 months apart
[04:37] <rweait1> skooks:yup.  I did it by accident. :-)
[04:37] <skooks> Is it just a dist-upgrade?
[04:37] <cfhowlett> skooks: yes, but why?  Unless you REALLY need the latest and greatest, I'd advise you stick with the LTS version
[04:37] <MeanEYE> marz: Naah, won't do me any good.
[04:37] <MeanEYE> marz: Did you check this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2050126&highlight=g480+network
[04:38] <Transhumanist> this might be an option too skooks: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[04:38] <skooks> Does 12.04 have livecd?
[04:38] <Transhumanist> yes
[04:38] <BlackDalek> Help!! I plugged a HDMI screen into the HDMI socket on my laptop and sound output device changed to built-in/HDMI... but now, when I unplug the HDMI cable, my sound output device is gone and I get no sound!
[04:38] <skooks> Goody, I can try it out then.
[04:38] <BlackDalek> rebooting does not let it return
[04:39] <Transhumanist> BlackDalek: does a restart fix the issue?
[04:39] <skooks> It does work.
[04:39] <skooks> Excellent.
[04:39] <tekkbuzz> Hi all, does anyone know what the /dev/name is for the 1st Serial port?
[04:39] <Transhumanist> sweet
[04:39] <skooks> 12.04 didn't work before for some reason. I think it's because that CD had something on it.
[04:39] <Transhumanist> oh well, at least it works now :)
[04:40] <marz> Yeah I Already did that
[04:40] <BlackDalek> Transfusion, no.. restarting does not bring back the sound device
[04:40] <marz> It's the first search result when I googled the problem
[04:40] <marz> hehehe
[04:40] <skooks> But yeah, how are distribution upgrades done on Ubuntu? Like, if you wanted to move from 12.04 to 12.10?
[04:40] <skooks> Just wondering for the future.
[04:40] <Transhumanist> I think there's a GUI option
[04:41] <skooks> Ahh.
[04:41] <Transhumanist> but I think the command is something like sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[04:41] <MeanEYE> marz: darn it. I think it's one of these: http://www.broadcom.com/support/ethernet_nic/downloaddrivers.php
[04:41] <marz> MeanEYE: Yeah, I already did that. That is the first search result when I googled the problem.
[04:41] <MeanEYE> marz: But am not sure.
[04:41] <skooks> Yeah, that's what I thought.
[04:41] <cfhowlett> skooks: when a new distro is available, software update will alert you
[04:41] <skooks> I'm used to console, so this shouldn't be much of a problem either way.
[04:41] <BlackDalek> Transhumanist, , no.. restarting does not bring back the sound device
[04:41] <marz> MeanEYE: Why don't we give it a try
[04:42] <MeanEYE> marz: I don't even know where to try.
[04:42] <BlackDalek> Transhumanist, plugging a device into my hdmi socket has killed ubunut's sound completely
[04:42] <BlackDalek> ubuntu*
[04:42] <Bosma> I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and I'm trying to set a hotkey 'alt-a', but the 'alt' key highlights the menu bar and so when I press 'a' it goes back to 'All Settings' and doesn't set the hotkey. How can I get around this?
[04:42] <Transhumanist> Plug the HDMI back in
[04:42] <Bosma> Thanks.
[04:42] <Transhumanist> does sound work again?
[04:42] <marz> MeanEYE: Let me boot up in Windows and verify the chipset
[04:42] <MeanEYE> marz: If you want my suggestion I would go to askubuntu.com and ask there. They will probably come up with solution. If nothing else comes up then you can try random picking drivers.
[04:42] <BlackDalek> Transhumanist, yes. then it dies again if I unplug it
[04:42] <Transhumanist> ok, cool
[04:43] <Transhumanist> now try these:
[04:43] <Transhumanist> http://askubuntu.com/a/176352
[04:43] <skooks> You guys are very helpful as an irc channel. You don't just say, "Ask the almighty bot."
[04:43] <tekkbuzz> I'll try again, I know someone knows this, does anyone know what the /dev/name is for the 1st Serial port?
[04:44] <marz> MeanEYE: Oh ok. Thanks for your time though. I really appreciate it. SOrry for the trouble.
[04:44] <MeanEYE> marz: It's not a trouble. But it's kind of hard to guess when you don't know the chipset.
[04:44] <Transhumanist> tekkbuzz: ttyS0 maybe?
[04:45] <Transhumanist> so /dev/ttyS0
[04:45] <Transhumanist> skooks: good! :D
[04:45] <RollinV2> anyone have a good ubuntu 12.04 after install script for automating some common tasks? ill customize it but need a good starting base
[04:45] <MeanEYE> skooks: Did anyone answer your question about upgrading?
[04:45] <skooks> I've had people refer me to bots that refer me to wikis I read and read again.
[04:45] <tekkbuzz> Transhumanist, okay, why are there so many of them because I only have one?
[04:45] <skooks> Yeah, it's just dist-upgrade in console.
[04:46] <MeanEYE> skooks: Isn't it do-release-upgrade? :D
[04:46] <tekkbuzz> I thought they are dynamicly created?
[04:46] <skooks> I dunno. I'll figure it out if I really need to.
[04:47] <MeanEYE> skooks: :) I don't have dist-upgrade, :D so it's probably do-release-upgrade but that's command line way to upgrade.
[04:47] <Fonsie> meanEYE: still having problems :/
[04:47] <skooks> It's dist-upgrade on Debian at least. But yeah, I'll deal with it if I need to (which I won't probably).
[04:47] <Transhumanist> tekkbuzz: I do not know much about serial ports, sorry. My comp doesn't have one. But when I do Arduino programming, the IDE creates one to use over USb with my Arduino Uno
[04:47] <skooks> I just need a solid work environment.
[04:47] <MeanEYE> skooks: If you want GUI just run update-manager and it will ask to upgrade. If you have LTS installed, it will ask only when next LTS comes out, which you need to configure in software sources.
[04:48] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: Hm, with what?
[04:48] <marz> MeanEYE: would this help? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071104075047AAkOoRZ
[04:48] <MeanEYE> marz: not really.
[04:49] <BlackDalek> Transhumanist, that did not work. Module-assistant failed.
[04:49] <marz> MeanEye: But my wireless is working right. If I manage to connect to a Wi-Fi network, will all this be a lot easier?
[04:49] <MeanEYE> marz: Wifi is working, yes. And I don't know how easier that would be.
[04:49] <Transhumanist> BlackDalek: if nobody here can help, then you'll have to make a thread asking for help on the ubuntuforums website
[04:49] <Fonsie> i tried sudo service lightdm start and it scrolled through some text till it got to "Starting cpu interrupts balancing daemon"
[04:50] <marz> MeanEYE: Ok, I'll just try to go to a Wi-Fi hotspot then. THanks again.
[04:50] <Fonsie> then it just stopped and didnt do anything else
[04:50] <MeanEYE> marz: Okay, sorry I didn't help.
[04:50] <tekkbuzz> Transhumanist, I got one of those Arduino's too but I haven't tinkered with it yet, I didn't think I had a serial port either, till I looked at the board and on an empty pin header, then I just had to hook up a cable and serial jack.
[04:50] <Fonsie> and it said ok along the right side of the screen
[04:51] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: Does "ps -A | grep X" return anything?
[04:51] <tekkbuzz> on=found
[04:51] <Fonsie> then i tried it a couple more times and it went till it stopped at "Stopped save kernel messages"
[04:51] <Fonsie> havent tried it
[04:52] <marz> MeanEYE: No no, you did great. :D
[04:52] <MeanEYE> Good time to try now.
[04:52] <Transhumanist> tekkbuzz: yeah I programme it via USB, but the Arduino IDE emulates a serial port over USB
[04:53] <MeanEYE> tekkbuzz: Unless you have  Arduino Ethernet, those need adapters.
[04:53] <Fonsie> and when i tried cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log it returned with an error and told me to check the /var/log/Xorg.0.log file
[04:53] <Fonsie> and when i type that in i get the permission denied
[04:53] <tekkbuzz> Transhumanist, right now I'm just trying to get an old Brother Label printer working with Ubuntu.
[04:54] <MeanEYE> Okay, I need to go to sleep. 6am. :/
[04:54] <MeanEYE> Have fun folks!
[04:54] <tekkbuzz> MeanEYE, see ya, thanks

[05:14] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: did you see the login window?

[05:16] <Fonsie> and i tried lubuntu because somebody suggested it because i have a low spec netbook

[05:17] <Gnomex> I need Some help.. why when i'm tried to Update my Ubuntu 12.04  he said.. Internet Conection error.. dunno why..
[05:17] <Fonsie> im not sure what that is or how to do it?
[05:17] <cfhowlett> !md5sum|Fonsie
[05:17] <ubottu> Fonsie: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[05:18] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: why?  because bad downloads happen to good people.
[05:18] <Gnomex> anybody can solve my problem..??
[05:18] <Fonsie> why  what?
[05:19] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: verify your ISO.  see the link I sent you.
[05:19] <arvut> what was the command for ignoring parts/joins again? it's been awhile since I wanted to do that. imma write it down this time..
[05:19] <RollinV2> Fonsie, a corrupt iso image will likely error on boot.
[05:20] <arvut> in irssi I meant
[05:21] <Fonsie> cfhowlett: sounds kind of bad but im not sure how to do the instructions in the link
[05:22] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: are you working on an ubuntu computer now?
[05:23] <Fonsie> no, its duel boot windows 7 and lubuntu
[05:23] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: so you're presently on the windows side, right?
[05:23] <Fonsie> yes
[05:24] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: so I imagine your saved the downloaded ISO in windows?
[05:25] <Fonsie> external usb hdd
[05:26] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: OK then.  Per the link, you need to first install winmd5sum

[05:43] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: details?
[05:45] <Fonsie> i went into the program from the browse window thing i selected my iso and then hit calculate
[05:45] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: how long did you wait?
[05:45] <cfhowlett> it takes time and will seem to be unresponsive
[05:45] <Fonsie> it gave me a md5 sum but the bottom one is blank
[05:46] <Fonsie> a few minutes
[05:46] <Fonsie> the compare slot is blank

[05:47] <Fonsie> 7ad57cadae955bd04019389d4b9c1dcb is in md5 sum but the compare slot under it is blank
[05:47] <Fonsie> torrent but from the lubuntu sight
[05:47] <Fonsie> site*
[05:47] <dr_willis> so it calculated the sym..

[05:48] <dr_willis> what did you do with the whatever.md5 file you downloaded?

[05:49] <Fonsie> what do i compare it to and how do i do that
[05:49] <Chad__> Fonsie: The compare slot is where you enter the md5 from the lubuntu website
[05:49] <Fonsie> only has one browse slot
[05:50] <Fonsie> ok
[05:50] <Fonsie> can you link it?
[05:50] <dr_willis> look at the sum in the .md5 file on the server
[05:50] <dr_willis> and  mdownload/browse to it..
[05:50] <dr_willis> makes sence?
[05:50] <dr_willis> it calculates the sum of the iso. and compares it to the ones in the .md5 file
[05:51] <Fonsie> im confused on what i need to do exactly
[05:51] <Fonsie> i have no idea what an .md5 file is
[05:51] <dr_willis> you download the .md5 file  AND the iso
[05:51] <Fonsie> or where to find/get it
[05:51] <dr_willis> its got the sum you compare TO
[05:51] <dr_willis> its on the download server somewhere
[05:52] <dr_willis> !md5

[05:52] <ubottu> To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[05:52] <arch> vishnu
[05:53] <arch> does anyone need help?
[05:55] <IBM_CLONE> Fonsie. The MD5 file is like a security file that compares the .iso file you downloaded with a reference file to verify the integrity of the downloaded file. Usually they come in pairs. Downloaded ISO accompanied with a file that makes sure the wanted download is not corrupted.

[06:03] <bjrohan> I restarted the computer, but it still runs :-(
[06:05] <dr_willis> what   did you do exactly
[06:06] <Flynsarmy> when i do a sudo hdparm -S 240 /dev/sdb I get: HDIO_DRIVE_CMD(setidle) failed: Operation not permitted. ideas?
[06:07] <bjrohan> I copied at line something like :() { :|: } etc
[06:07] <bjrohan> BUT before then I thought I had limited my numbe of processes to protect myself, but alas I did not

[06:14] <eagernewb> I have tried obvious solutions.
[06:14] <dr_willis> eagernewb:  try the esc key
[06:14] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: no idea.  this is 12.10, right?
[06:14] <Fonsie> yes
[06:14] <eagernewb> Okay, that's a good idea.
[06:14] <HeLLy> Well I got the right APN for my internet connection now but now it just cycles trying to fully connect
[06:14] <Fonsie> lubuntu-12.10-desktop-i386 is the name is the name of the iso file i have
[06:15] <Zwei> However, the exact same thing when put in crontab works. i.e. via crontab -e , I am running Ubuntu 12.10
[06:15] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: no idea why, but it might be a graphics issue. try the nomodeset option
[06:15] <Fonsie> and i check it in winmd5sum against https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
[06:15] <cfhowlett> !nomodeset|fonsie
[06:15] <ubottu> fonsie: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
=== Err404NotFound is now known as Error404NotFound
[06:15] <cfhowlett> Fonsie: failing that, I'd urge to you drop back to 12.04 in xubuntu or lubuntu.  both of which can be liveCD tested before you install.

[06:23] <kslater> mythtv can lag behind the latest on any particular distro because it takes a lot of work to get all the packages at the right versions for everything to work.

[06:27] <eagernewb> Another question: I was in the middle of installing 230 updates when my computer messed up; I froze in the Unity environment's app menu and wasn't able to get out. After that, the Unity environment seemed to crash, destroying the menu on the left of the screen and the toolbar on the top. I just had a few windows open, but not the updates window. How can I find out if the updates are still being installed?
[06:27] <eagernewb> Would it damage the computer if I reboot while the updates are still happening?
[06:27] <eagernewb> Is there a task manager I can look at?
[06:28] <cfhowlett> eagernewb: damage?  no, but you'll need to complete the upgrade process

[06:42] <Vyom_> Hi everyone. Recently migrating to ubuntu, its quite a struggle really to get used to it after using Bindows for years. But as I am progressing I am learning new things everyday. Just today I learnt that transmission can't be used to continue to download a torrent, some part of it which was already downloaded in Bindows? Is that really true? Do I have to use wine to use uTorrent, and hope it can continue torrent? :S

[06:55] <pablo_> well
[06:55] <pablo_> i downloaded it from torrent
[06:55] <pablo_> the iso~
[06:55] <pablo_> perhaps my windows isnt booting from USB
[06:55] <Muphrid> pablo_: but did unetbootin give any error output?
[06:56] <pablo_> nope
[06:56] <Muphrid> pablo_: so you are booting and your bios is ignoring the usb?

[06:58] <Flynsarmy> tekkbuzz: how do i use this to spin down my drives automatically?

[06:59] <dr_willis> pablo_:  depends on what work you want to do
[06:59] <pablo_> use Ubuntu as a secondary OS for fun to surf net
[06:59] <phunyguy> ChruBuntu? Is that even supported?
[06:59] <pablo_> is 8gb enough
[06:59] <dr_willis> you could install to a flash drive for that...

[07:00] <pablo_> how much is that total?
[07:00] <tekkbuzz> Flynsarmy: I just got it myself, but I see it looks like it can be done.
[07:00] <pablo_> you know what maybe il take this advice
[07:00] <dr_willis> you could do a full install TO a flash drive and not evne partition. if you are only going to allocate 8gb
[07:00] <Muphrid> your free space - 2gb is the root partition
[07:00] <pablo_> install to USB. is it equally fast from USB?
[07:01] <Flynsarmy> tekkbuzz: http://zackreed.me/articles/60-spin-down-idle-hard-disks this page has some info about not letting SMART wake the drives if they're in standby which might be useful though it's not our current issue
[07:01] <dr_willis> does it matter if you are just websurfing

[07:01] <pablo_> i guess so. okay how do i install it to USB?
[07:01] <dr_willis> same as you do to hd.

[07:01] <dr_willis> boot live cd/usb  install to a bigger usb
[07:02] <pablo_> can i do it from windows
[07:02] <Muphrid> pablo_: in the installer partition page it lets you select which device you want to install to
[07:02] <pablo_> is that WUBI tool the one
[07:02] <jason32423> if you install to usb.. does that become portable?  can you just take it around with you and boot from any computer?

[07:03] <dr_willis>  you can do  LIVE INSTALL TTO USB FROM WINDOWS. OR A FULL INSTALL VIA A BOOT CD/USB
[07:03] <dr_willis> oops
[07:03] <dr_willis> a and casp lock too close
[07:04] <jason32423> can you then just take your usb around and use it in any computer to have your own thing?
[07:04] <dr_willis> you could
[07:04] <dr_willis> live usb may work better for thazt
[07:04] <jason32423> would that become a driver nightmare?
[07:04] <dr_willis> depends on your hardware
[07:05] <jason32423> random hardware if your taking it places
[07:05] <dr_willis> as i said.. live usb is better for moveing around
[07:05] <dr_willis> but not as flexible
[07:05] <jason32423> but with usb install you can keep your shortcuts and files and configs and such
[07:05] <Muphrid> jason32423: you can do that with a persistent live usb I guess
[07:05] <dr_willis> a 'full' install is the same as on a hard disk
[07:06] <jason32423> persistent live?
[07:06] <dr_willis> persistant/live is similer.. but has some limits

[07:07] <pablo_> ive mounted the ISO iin windows, and am using the windows based installer to install to my USB drive
[07:07] <Muphrid> ubuntu's usb creator does that
[07:07] <pablo_> is that right?

[07:07] <skooks> 12.04*
[07:07] <skooks> Not 11.4.
[07:07] <jason32423> Muphrid:never bothered to play with that
[07:07] <linuxuz3r> hi
[07:07] <skooks> Any reason in particular behind that or?

[07:07] <dr_willis> otahak:  we done know what part you mean by similer to...
[07:07] <otahak> I installed ubuntu 12. The left-hand menu thingy - what I've found to be called the "global menu"
[07:07] <jason32423> Muphrid:would that stay on the live usb?
[07:08] <Muphrid> jason32423: i believe so
[07:08] <dr_willis> left side panel is the launcher/panel
[07:08] <ForSpareParts> Is there a way to disable the menu bar at the top of a second monitor in Unity? Or at least stop it from showing up when fullscreen apps on that monitor lose focus?
[07:08] <otahak> I dont like it, and I was hoping to remove it and put in the old ubuntu 10 menu
[07:08] <skooks> Hit f6 and choose nomodset, interesting.
[07:08] <dr_willis> global menu is the top  menu bar
[07:08] <pablo_> okay thats not working it seems
[07:08] <dr_willis> you seem to be using the totally wrong words otahak
[07:08] <otahak> that would seem so :)
[07:08] <jason32423> Muphrid: so, if i do something stupid with the ubuntu live usb, then i have dumbed up the whole thing and a reboot wont fix it

[07:09] <Brofie> FRIDAY
[07:09] <otahak> anyway - you're familiar with the left-handed application menu thingy in ubuntu 12 that Im talking about right?
[07:09] <pablo_> is there a way to install from Windows -> USB
[07:09] <Brofie> no
[07:09] <pablo_> i have the ISO ready
[07:09] <Muphrid> jason32423: I dont know, havent had the time to use it for that kind of testing
[07:09] <dr_willis> otahak:  thats the unity panel
[07:09] <dr_willis> its not a menu
[07:10] <otahak> ah.
[07:10] <otahak> that explains why my google searching hasn't yielded much

[07:11] <pablo_> i want to put ubuntu 12.10 iso into USB as OS
[07:11] <Brofie> I'll be good, I swear.
[07:11] <jason32423> OH, i forgot.  i have questions too!!!
[07:11] <pablo_> so do i need linuxlive then
[07:11] <otahak> if I may - are you familiar with a way to restore the old global menu from ubuntu 10?
[07:12] <jason32423> how important is TRIM
[07:12] <otahak> (not the unity panel)
[07:12] <IdleOne> Brofie: That was your second chance :)

[07:12] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, The ISO creates a USB-bootable version of Ubuntu.
[07:12] <pablo_> if i mount the ISO and run wubi.exe
[07:12] <ForSpareParts> It contains the installer program you can use to put Ubuntu on your computer, but you can also use ubuntu off the flash drive.
[07:12] <pablo_> is that the right way? then pick the USB and install
[07:12] <seednode_> otahak: You'll need to use a different DE. I don't know if Gnome2 (the one in 10.04) is still supported
[07:13] <seednode_> otahak, but there are plenty of similar alternatives
[07:13] <jason32423> is wubi standalone?  does it not need windows?
[07:13] <pablo_> its windows .exe i think
[07:13] <Muphrid> otahak: I believe the global menu is from the indicator-appmenu package
[07:13] <otahak> seednode_ please - tell me more. Or at least where to look. I'd like the old system/applications menu from version 10
[07:14] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, If memory serves, that would actually do a "Wubi Install" of Ubuntu to your flash drive. It sounds like you want plain old "bootable Ubuntu on a flash drive," right?
[07:14] <seednode_> otahak: As I said, I'm not sure there's an exact replacement
[07:14] <otahak> sudo apt-get install indicator-appmenu ?
[07:14] <Muphrid> otahak: remove, but if you want the old style back, gnome-panel (fallback) would be your easiest option
[07:14] <pablo_> trying linux live usb creator
[07:14] <jason32423> does anyone have any opinions on the importance of TRIM on a ubuntu ssd ?
[07:14] <otahak> well, here's the end result I desire - I want a button in my global menu that lets me access my applications in the same style ubuntu 10 did
[07:15] <Muphrid> otahak: then install gnome-panel
[07:15] <Muphrid> and select "gnome fallback" from the login screen
=== jason32423 is now known as jjason_away
[07:15] <otahak> thank you!
[07:15] <pablo_> how much space do you need to allocate to "persistence"
[07:15] <otahak> sorry for not using proper nomenclature
[07:15] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, Is that the program here? http://www.linuxliveusb.com/
[07:15] <pablo_> yes Forspareparts
[07:16] <Muphrid> otahak: note that it is not functionally the same as gnome 2, it is a fallback.
[07:16] <Muphrid> but it resembles the looks of gnome 2
[07:16] <otahak> good enough! lol
[07:16] <arvut> pablo_: unetbooting is probably better, available for windows and linux (maybe even for mac)
[07:16] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, I've never used that particular program, but the website talks a lot about making virtualized Linux installations, which isn't what you want.
[07:16] <pablo_> unetbootin had no option to install the OS as a usable bootable though
[07:16] <pablo_> it made it an installer
[07:16] <pablo_> though when i booted from it it had an option to "try ubuntu without installing"
[07:16] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, arvut is right -- the "installer" it makes *is* a bootable Ubuntu.
[07:17] <ForSpareParts> Yep. Just pick that option and you're good to go.
[07:17] <arvut> a live usb, yes. you can still run ubuntu from it, with the speedlimits of usb
[07:17] <pablo_> yea but its kind of annoying having to go through 1 menu and pick that option
[07:17] <pablo_> i just want something that straight away boots ubuntu
[07:17] <pablo_> so im trying this LinuxLive cd
[07:17] <ForSpareParts> You can just let it go through that menu.
[07:17] <ForSpareParts> The default is to launch Ubuntu, IIRC.
[07:17] <pablo_> oh mine just stopped at that menu
[07:17] <pablo_> anyway no harm in using LInux Live cd right?
[07:17] <ForSpareParts> Oh. I could be wrong.
[07:18] <Brofie> You are
[07:18] <ForSpareParts> Yeah, no harm -- just make sure you're creating a live usb rather than a virtualization.
[07:18] <ddfgt> #ubuntu-dev
[07:18] <pablo_> yeah
[07:18] <ForSpareParts> Brofie, OK. Sorry.
[07:18] <arvut> right, then you can choose a usb as install destination and do it via normal install. or is there a problem in that?
[07:18] <pablo_> its installing to USB now
[07:18] <pablo_> i maxed the persistence space at 4gb
[07:18] <Brofie> ForSpareParts: you're not forgiven, but thanks anyway
[07:18] <pablo_> what is persistence?
[07:18] <seel> hey, I'm having so much trouble getting wine installed...
[07:18] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, I mention that because the website says a lot about virtualized installs.
[07:19] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, Persistence is the amount of space dedicated to keeping your files between startups.
[07:19] <Muphrid> pablo_: Having a Live USB key is better than just using a Live CD because you  can even save your data and install software. This feature is called  persistence (available only on selected Linux).
[07:19] <Muphrid> pablo_: http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/help/faq/persistence
[07:19] <pablo_> Muphrid sorry i meant create LIVe USB. i am creating a live usb
[07:19] <seel> I'm running ubuntu 12.10 and it keeps telling me I have broken or missing dependencies, which I posted about in the forums and so far, what was suggested hasn't worked
[07:19] <arvut> interesting that ppl make those .exe installers for a whole systeminstall, makes little sense to me.
[07:20] <Brofie> I just wanna be friends with everyone in here
[07:20] <Brofie> is that so much to ask for?
[07:20] <Muphrid> pablo_: you asked about persistence, I gave you information on that subject
[07:20] <pablo_> thanks pal
[07:21] <arvut> Muphrid: he wants a complete ubuntu install, non-live version. on a usb stick. bootable usb more or less. I've considered making a bootable gentoo usb system that I can use on other pc's than my own as well.
[07:21] <pablo_> what arvut said
[07:21] <Muphrid> arvut: I had this idea before, but didnt try it, not sure how it would work
[07:22] <arvut> pablo_: its an interesting concept, but if you're new to ubuntu or linux in general, it might get really tricky. don't give up tho :)
[07:22] <Muphrid> and to install gentoo on it you will need a really big one
[07:22] <pablo_> yeah
[07:22] <Brofie> I'mm baaaack
[07:22] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, What LiLi creates would presumably work for that. Fair warning: it'll probably be slow.
[07:22] <Brofie> guess who's back
[07:22] <Brofie> back again
[07:22] <Brofie> shady's back
[07:22] <Brofie> back again
[07:22] <FloodBot1> Brofie: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[07:23] <pablo_> as slow as any other ubuntu on USB right forspareparts???? or no?
[07:23] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, Yeah, that's what I meant.
[07:23] <pablo_> gotcha!
[07:23] <pablo_> its just to test ubuntu 12.10
[07:23] <pablo_> if i like it. il install partition
[07:23] <ForSpareParts> Cool.
[07:23] <arvut> Brofie: please go to a offtopic chat instead, this is ubuntu support. I recommend ubuntu-offtopic or gentoo-chat
[07:23] <seel> would it be helpful to paste a link to the forum poast so someone may help me further?
[07:24] <ForSpareParts> Wubi's a pretty decent way to try Ubuntu, as well, if you don't need to be able to take it between computers.
[07:24] <ForSpareParts> Less performance/storage problems.
[07:24] <arvut> IdleOne: banned him?
[07:25] <ddfgt> there is someone expert here?
[07:26] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, (tagging you, just in case you didn't see the last couple things I said)
[07:26] <arvut> pablo_: you can add the usb drive to your bootmenu in bios if you want it to be a regular bootable OS
[07:26] <pablo_> nah i caught it
[07:26] <pablo_> i probably should have done wubi
[07:26] <pablo_> ive used wubi before
[07:27] <arvut> ddfgt: if you need help, just ask your question. plenty of skilled people in here.
[07:27] <Tiklu> I installed ati driver in my ubuntu box
[07:27] <Tiklu> the driver is detected properly
[07:27] <Tiklu> xorg.conf is also configured
[07:28] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, OK, cool. Wasn't sure exactly how new you were, wanted to cover all bases.
[07:28] <Tiklu> but still ubutu is saying experience : standard
[07:28] <Tiklu> I even installed the VA things
[07:28] <Tiklu> got the instructions from her
[07:28] <Tiklu> her
[07:28] <Tiklu> here
[07:28] <Tiklu> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
[07:28] <FloodBot1> Tiklu: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[07:29] <Tiklu> ok :)
[07:29] <Tiklu> sorry
[07:29] <skooks> LiveCD and installation loading isn't supposed to take very long from a CD, right?
[07:29] <cfhowlett> skooks: compared to what?
[07:29] <pablo_> yeah no problems
[07:29] <skooks> 10 minutes long.
[07:30] <pablo_> my linux live key is ready! time to test
[07:30] <skooks> I tried using the Live CD and straight up installing it and it hangs on the loading screen.
[07:30] <ForSpareParts> pablo_, Woo! Good luck!
[07:30] <pablo_> thanks people
[07:30] <tekkbuzz> Flynsarmy: you find it yet? smartctl has an apm arg. if you look in the man page. It's something like: smartctl -c /dev/sde -g apm<number-between-1-254>
[07:30] <pablo_> its booting fine
[07:31] <pablo_> btw do i need to download drivers?
[07:31] <pablo_> or what
[07:31] <skooks> Seriously though, how long should live CD booting or installation booting take on a decent laptop?
[07:31] <pablo_> takes a while i guess
[07:32] <skooks> What's a while
[07:32] <skooks> ?
[07:32] <pablo_> lol dont know
[07:32] <pablo_> wahtever youre expericing ;)
[07:32] <pablo_> cool im in ubuntu 12.10 from usb
[07:32] <skooks> I have a dual core AMD processor with 4 gigs of ram and some HD Radeon 4000 series chipset and for some reason I cannot even boot into the Live CD or into the installation process.
[07:32] <pablo_> USB Ethernet dongle works
[07:33] <skooks> I waited a good 15 minutes.
[07:33] <pablo_> brightness control doesnt lol
[07:34] <pablo_> says instlal 13.04 kernel https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbookPrime
[07:34] <Muphrid> skooks: that is the standard for all usable hardware
[07:34] <pablo_> is there an easy way to do that?
[07:34] <Muphrid> (the installation)
[07:34] <skooks> Muphrid, so I should just let it sit for an hour until it boots into the Live CD mode or installation candidate?
[07:35] <skooks> I cannot remember it always taking that long.
[07:35] <skooks> I remember waiting 5 minutes max on my desktop.
[07:35] <Muphrid> skooks: do you mean it takes 15 min to boot or to install?
[07:35] <skooks> It just hangs there.
[07:35] <skooks> On the loading screen.
[07:35] <skooks> I've waited 15 minutes and it just hangs there continuously.
[07:35] <Muphrid> Ok, 12.10?
[07:35] <skooks> 12.04.
[07:36] <Muphrid> then that is weird, do you see the plymouth screne? can you ctrl+alt+f1 while hanging to see the output?
[07:36] <skooks> Plymouth screen?
[07:36] <Muphrid> yes
[07:37] <skooks> What is that exactly?
[07:37] <Muphrid> skooks: the ubuntu purple boot screen where you see the logo and 5 dots acting as a progress bar
[07:38] <pablo_> stackoverflow is awesome. http://askubuntu.com/questions/202630/cant-mount-any-partition-acl-error
[07:38] <skooks> I can get to the plymouth screen with the dot progress bar.
[07:38] <skooks> And it just hangs on the bars loading forever.
[07:38] <skooks> on the dots*
[07:39] <Muphrid> skooks: try to press ctrl+alt+f1 in that screen and it should show a console
[07:39] <Muphrid> with boot messages
[07:39] <Fonsie> can anybody give me the readers digest version of what wubi is?
[07:39] <Fonsie> and how it works?
[07:39] <IdleOne> !wubi
[07:39] <ubottu> Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide for troubleshooting. Please  file bugs at http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug. For Ubuntu Oneiric/11.10 http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/wubi.exe
[07:39] <skooks> I'll try that and come back if I get no results.
[07:40] <Haematoma> Is there anyway to leave x11 tunnelled applications active after an SSH connection has been terminated?
[07:40] <Fonsie> can i use wubi to install lubuntu without getting rid of windows (duel boot)
[07:41] <Savage_CL> anybody around?
[07:41] <b3nj> help me, no sound in firefox
[07:42] <Savage_CL> using pulse audio?
[07:42] <b3nj> Savage_CL: how do i know?
[07:42] <hapster> any news with nouveau working with Optimus laptops for 13.04?
[07:43] <Savage_CL> b3nj, what version of ubuntu?
[07:43] <b3nj> Savage_CL: 12.10
[07:43] <Savage_CL> if you hit the super key and type in pulse, does pulse audio come up?
[07:43] <b3nj> Savage_CL: pusleaudio volume control
[07:44] <Savage_CL> open that up
[07:44] <Savage_CL> go to applications
[07:44] <Savage_CL> see if FF is in there.
[07:44] <Savage_CL> anybody know much about networking in ubuntu?
[07:44] <b3nj> Savage_CL: where is "applications"
[07:45] <Savage_CL> should be a tab in the volume control
[07:45] <Savage_CL> err sorry
[07:45] <Savage_CL> the playback tab
[07:45] <b3nj> Savage_CL: Show: Applications?
[07:45] <Savage_CL> yea
[07:45] <Savage_CL> does FF show up?
[07:47] <b3nj> Savage_CL: i am playing a video now and in playback i see bar going left/right
[07:47] <Savage_CL> http://shared.jarmstrong.me/images/Selection_032.png
[07:47] <Savage_CL> That's about what it should look like with something playing.
[07:47] <b3nj> Savage_CL: yeah, it shows that something is playing
[07:47] <Savage_CL> Then the problem is not with firefox.
[07:47] <Savage_CL> check to make sure it's going to the right adapter (in your output devices)
[07:47] <speedy> good morning ! is this the ubuntu help channel
[07:48] <Savage_CL> It is!
[07:48] <Savage_CL> what is you need help with?
[07:48] <speedy> :-)
[07:48] <b3nj> Savage_CL: it is only firefox problem, chrome plays sound well
[07:48] <Savage_CL> Go to your Output Devices tab
[07:48] <Savage_CL> does it show anything playing?
[07:48] <speedy> i would need some help with nvidia GTX 560 TI from EVGA
[07:49] <b3nj> Savage_CL: something is playing there too
[07:49] <Savage_CL> the generic nvidia drivers seem to work well, speedy.
[07:49] <Savage_CL> or rather, the open souce versions.
[07:49] <Savage_CL> b3nj, would it happen to be the firefox stuffs?
[07:49] <b3nj> Savage_CL: yeah, it is a youtube video playing in firefox
[07:49] <SadlyMistaken> Hello everybody. I've a problem with microphone in ubuntu. Whatever program i use to record with the webcam, allways the audio is bad. 6 or 7 seconds later. what can i do?
[07:50] <speedy> my problem is from boot on! after i select boot option i enter in some kind of blue screen thats all
[07:50] <Savage_CL> I'm not sure, speedy. I've not had that problem.
[07:50] <Savage_CL> b3nj, so pulse is showing that the audio is getting to the output device?
[07:50] <b3nj> Savage_CL: yes
[07:50] <Fonsie> can i use wubi to install lubuntu without removing windows (duel boot)
[07:51] <Savage_CL> is it the *correct* audio device?
[07:51] <Savage_CL> fonsie, I would guess so.
[07:51] <SadlyMistaken> Fonsie first you must to create the partition of the hd

[07:52] <Savage_CL> so is it getting to your TV?
[07:52] <b3nj> Savage_CL: i do not have a tv
[07:52] <JohnTeddy> How can I find out every package on my system that isn't part of the stock ubunt quantal distribution?
[07:52] <Savage_CL> Is that the *right* audio device?
[07:53] <Savage_CL> it looks like it's sending the audio through HDMI (to your display)
[07:53] <speedy> 1 version of ubuntu started but only under the options try ubuntu after i add repo data for nvidia update server and did install from lattest grafik driver after reboot same blue screen ass on all versions i tryed befor
[07:53] <timgrin> not sure if problem is UEFI or the AMD system on the laptop
[07:53] <b3nj> Savage_CL: i do not have anything connected to hdmi
[07:53] <Savage_CL> well as you just told me, that's where it's going.
[07:54] <b3nj> Savage_CL: /dev/null
[07:54] <Savage_CL> :P
[07:54] <arvut> timgrin: I know that some devices that comes with win8 has uefi instead of bios, which sometimes locks the hardware to a certain OS. the must be ways around it tho.
[07:54] <dr_willis> there 'might' be ways around it
[07:55] <dr_willis> depending on the locks
[07:55] <b3nj> Savage_CL: when i play video in chrome in pulse settings it shows that something is playing in Built-in Audio Analog Stereo
[07:55] <Savage_CL> So it's going to the wrong audio device. now we're getting somewehre.
[07:55] <arvut> there is always a way. that way can be a very long and hard way tho. anything is possible.
[07:55] <Savage_CL> where*
[07:55] <timgrin> arvut: I have turned off UEFI in the bios (initially wanted dual boot but now happy with complete wipe and install just to get it installed) but the usb drive when plugged in goes to a flicking black screen with small wavy lines on it
[07:55] <dr_willis> ying a new pc from system76, then thats not really a way...

[08:08] <b3nj> Savage_CL: in Volume Control > Configuration i set GF108 High Definition Audio Controller off
[08:08] <cfhowlett> b3nj: quick : how?
[08:08] <timgrin> dr_willis: no cigar - it seems to start flicking immediately after the usb disk drive is powered up - I think it has problems loading grub (I have tried 12.04LTS 32 bit and 12.04LTS64bit usb drives)
[08:08] <cfhowlett> b3nj: it's always the simple little things ...
[08:08] <Savage_CL> There ya go >.<
[08:09] <jbarber> Hey!
[08:09] <b3nj> cfhowlett, Savage_CL, thanks
[08:11] <Haematoma> anyone know of a free service similar to dyndns?
[08:11] <Haematoma> I'm looking to have my SSH server frequently attach its registered ip address to a free domain name.
[08:11] <JohnTeddy> Is there a meta package that is the entire default ubuntu install for quantal?
[08:12] <JohnTeddy> So a meta package for all stock/default packages.
[08:14] <timgrin> anyones else know how to fix boot graphics problems where grub doesn't even load?
[08:15] <BlackDalek> this is what I see in my sound outpute devices now.. it USED to say something like "built-in audio" http://imagebin.org/241799
[08:18] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, What does your lspci output say? Does Ubuntu see your sound card?
[08:19] <gabkdlly> JohnTeddy, I believe ubuntu-desktop does that
[08:19] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, yes. 00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 7 Series/C210 Series Chipset Family High Definition Audio Controller (rev 04)
[08:19] <jbarber> Uh, I think you can use DNS Dynamic.
[08:19] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, or that might be the HDMI port...
[08:20] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, in which case... no, the audio device is gone
[08:20] <jbarber> That sucks.
[08:20] <skooks> Yeah, when I try to oot into Ubuntu's live cd or install I notice that it eventually gets to the point in console where it says, "Unable To Find A Medium Containing A Live File System"
[08:20] <skooks> Ugh.
[08:21] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, No it is definately your sound card
[08:21] <BlackDalek> ok
[08:22] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, now what is the output of aplay -l (lower case L), can you pastebin the result please?
[08:22] <Muphrid> skooks: my guess is something went wrong in the liveusb/cd copying then
[08:23] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1498954/
[08:23] <skooks> the CD itself or?
[08:23] <skooks> The*
[08:23] <Muphrid> is it a cd?
[08:23] <dctrd> Yeah
[08:23] <skooks> Yes.
[08:24] <Muphrid> the problem is in the boot medium, which is the cd
[08:24] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok, you have a sound card that is recognised by Ubuntu, now we just have to get it going :)
[08:25] <skooks> How do I verify that the CD is the problem?
[08:25] <skooks> I do believe there is a way.
[08:25] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, oh joy!
[08:28] <Muphrid> skooks: Um, not sure if md5 checking works in a cd
[08:29] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok now open a terminal and run alsamixer
[08:30] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, What I want you to do is check to make sure your sound card is selected properly
[08:30] <Muphrid> skooks: perhaps you can boot the cd in virtualbox
[08:31] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, alsamixer shows master, PCM and SPDIF as playback devices
[08:32] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok press F6 and select the PCM sound card
[08:33] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, my options are default, HDA Intel PCH or "enter a device name"
[08:34] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok which one is currently selected?
[08:35] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, HDA blah blah etc... is selected I guess, since it says that at top left for alsamixer window
[08:35] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, No worries, just escape out of the selection window
[08:36] <jbarber> Does anyone do any programming in C/C++?
[08:37] <Gavilan2> jared5552: I used to...
[08:37] <jbarber> Did you do any OpenGL or SDL stuff?
[08:37] <skooks> d
[08:37] <skooks> Muphrid great idea.
[08:38] <Emanon> Damn I missed it. What did muffy say?
[08:38] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Now back at the main screen again there at the bottom of the first column called master should be 2 zeros
[08:39] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, If there is MM then use your arrow keys to highlight Master and then press m to toggle
[08:39] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, And then do the same for the column called PCM
[08:39] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, http://imagebin.org/241800
[08:39] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Now play some sound/music and see what you get
[08:41] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Yeah like that :) Probably wouldn't hurt to mute S/PDIF though
[08:41] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, as you can see there is no 00 below PCM though
[08:41] <Emanon> Does it cause hissing if you're not using it or something Mechdave?
[08:41] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Yeah, that is ok, just means you can't mute it :)
[08:42] <Mechdave> Emanon, Just doesn't work for him
[08:42] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok can you play any music or sound now?
[08:42] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, rhythymbox is playing silence.
[08:42] <blim> hi, Is there a way I cant optimize Ubuntu internet setting for gaming?
[08:42] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, all sound is silent.. movies, system sounds etc...
[08:43] <aeon-ltd> blim: you can't besides free up as much bndwidth as possible
[08:43] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, It is a silly question but you haven't muted it in gnome app for sound?
[08:44] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, you're right, that is a silly question. It's not muted. :)
[08:44] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Good... Simple stuff like that has tripped me up for a bit before :)
[08:44] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, sound comes out of my TV when I plug the HDMI cable back in... if that helps.
[08:44] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok Hang on, I have to log in to Gnome... BRB
[08:45] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok so sounds like the sound is routed to HDMI
[08:46] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, OK hang on for a sec, will go to gnome
[08:46] <BlackDalek> Are you SURE the HDA Intel PCh is my sound card and not just the HDMI port?
[08:48] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, Are you SURE the thing in alsamixer is my soundcard and not the HDMI port? Intel PantherPoint HDMI sounds more like the HDMI port than the onboard audio card to me.... :(
[08:48] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, I am doing some research atm... Trying to verify whether it is a HDMI port or not
[08:51] <ddfgt> hi
[08:51] <Cong> Why aren't there options to change the clock format for gnome-panel? ubuntu 12.04
[08:51] <ddfgt> how i can mount my NAS in ubuntu?
[08:51] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, In your sound settings you should have in the Play Sound Through box a couple of choices... Currently you have none
[08:51] <Emanon> Cong, I think they're in the gconf-editor options.
[08:52] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, that's my original question
[08:52] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, In alsamixer press F5 and see if Master Mono is muted?
[08:52] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, So the problem is that Ubuntu has somehow forgotten about your sound card
[08:52] <blim> aeon-ltd: ok thanks
[08:53] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, But it hasn't really
[08:53] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, I know.. that's my whole problem. I see nothing called master mono in alsamixer. I see a Master, and it isn't muted
[08:54] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Even after pressing F5?
[08:55] <ddfgt> someone?
[08:55] <Cong> Emanon, can't find them in gconf-editor
[08:56] <Emanon> Hold on I'm looking for the path, I'm on 12.10 so it's not there for me.
[08:56] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, http://imagebin.org/241801
[08:57] <Emanon> My mistake Cong I must have been remembering to back when they used standard Gnome.
[08:57] <Mechdave> ddfgt, Does your NAS work off Windows sharing?
[08:57] <Mechdave> BlackDalek, Ok, hang on just doing some reading
[08:58] <ddfgt> Mechdave, is the "xtreamer"
[08:58] <BlackDalek> Ubuntu gobbled up my soundcard and won't give it back :(
[08:58] <ddfgt> it's look like a box that seat near to the TV
[08:58] <Emanon> Cong: Is there an option in System Settings>Time & Date?
[08:59] <ddfgt> Mechdave, ?
[08:59] <Emanon> In the "Clock" tab of "Time & Date" perhaps Cong.
[09:03] <kelvinella> guys i found a bug in nautilus

[09:03] <kelvinella> and cut and paste files wont work
[09:04] <kelvinella> only paste into folder work
[09:04] <kelvinella> it works

[09:05] <kelvinella> but the paste in right click menu is gray out

[09:05] <SwashBuckla> I'd love to be able to put in a CD, boot, and have an OS set up with all my desired packages without pushing another button

[09:10] <SwashBuckla> http://askubuntu.com/questions/122505/how-do-i-create-completely-unattended-install-for-ubuntu seems to answer my question :)
[09:10] <SwashBuckla> has anyone here done this?
[09:11] <EricHerman> anybody good with screen resolution issues? I upgraded my xubuntu to version 12.10 and since then my screen has been at the wrong resolution. It used to be that when I had a game or something that left the screen in the wrong resoution, I could fix things with: xrandr --output DVI-0 --mode 1920x1200
[09:11] <EricHerman> however, now I get a message that "xrandr: Failed to get size of gamma for output default"
[09:12] <SwashBuckla> in the meantime I think I might try dpkg --set-selections < installed-software
[09:12] <BlackDalek> Mechdave, welcome back
[09:12] <cfhowlett> !remastersys|SwashBuckla
[09:13] <EricHerman> I tried to change from "DVI-0" to "default" as suggested by a web-search, but that resulted in "xrandr: cannot find mode 1920x1200"
[09:13] <SwashBuckla> !remastersys SwashBuckla
[09:13] <cfhowlett> SwashBuckla: see remastersys for customized ubuntu iso
[09:13] <SwashBuckla> Sorry, I don't know anything about remastersys SwashBuckla
[09:13] <SwashBuckla> cfhowlett: ok
[09:13] <cfhowlett> http://www.remastersys.com/
[09:13] <EricHerman> And indeed, when I use the GUI display settings tool, I do not see 1920x1200 in the list of options.

=== _Garr255 is now known as Garr255
[09:18] <cfhowlett> SwashBuckla: pretty sure there's a boot log somewhere.  Also, you can reboot and turn off silent mode so you can see the boot scroll
[09:19] <SwashBuckla> is silent mode a GRUB flag?
[09:19] <cfhowlett> SwashBuckla: looking - wait 1

I'm upgrading ubuntu 11.1o to 12.04.1 and mid-way the windows disappear  with the background and mouse still there. i went to the ctrl-alt F1 terminal, did htop and i think the release upgrader is still running, basically, how can i get my GUI working again without stopping the upgrade?

[10:02] <Dayofswords> cfhowlett: that just goes back tot he GUI but it's not working right, I only have a mouse and partial bottom of the background, no desktop, unity or anything
[10:02] <cfhowlett> Dayofswords: so the upgrade is running but the display is fragged?
[10:03] <Dayofswords> cfhowlett: pretty much, It got to the upgrading packages part then while i was waited freaked out on me
[10:04] <Dayofswords> I think the "do you want to remove these not needed packages"
[10:04] <Dayofswords> is the part it's probably on now
[10:04] <MonkeyDust> press enter, or y
[10:05] <netchip> a simple question: if I am at /, and I have a script executed, which unmounts /, and it is on /, will it continue? Or is it just stopping?
[10:05] <cfhowlett> Dayofswords: here's a thought: let the upgrade run.  If you still see display issues on reboot, then either your iso is flawed *THIS is why I always md5sum check before install* or your graphics are failing.  Assuming you had proper graphics under 11.10, I'd suggest a corrupt ISO.
[10:05] <cfhowlett> Dayofswords: also a good reason to do clean installs rather than distro upgrades ...
[10:05] <Dayofswords> cfhowlett: it was not with an iso, i was using Ubuntu's "Upgrade to ubuntu 12.04.1" button-thingy
[10:06] <cfhowlett> Dayofswords: understood ...
[10:06] <MonkWitDaFunk> hi channel, is badblocks included with ubuntu after installing? i just installed precise
[10:06] <Dayofswords> the process with the huge dpkg command ended a few minutes ago so i think the upgrdae part finished.
[10:07] <cfhowlett> Dayofswords: fwiw, it's usually quicker to DL the ISO, md5sum and then install.
[10:07] <Dayofswords> cfhowlett: yeah, probably would have been
[10:10] <Dayofswords> cfhowlett: oh here is something there is process running with "gksu -desktop /usr/share/applications/update-manager.desktop -- /tmp/update-manager-Yj6bJ4/precise"  so the manager is prompting for a password, any idea how i could somehow enter it without being in the gui(since it's bork)?

[12:40] <olivia_> MonkeyDust I ran the wrong dd command
[12:40] <MonkeyDust> olivia_  how can you dd if it's not detected?
[12:40] <olivia_> MonkeyDust I ran dd and that is what corrupted it
[12:41] <eos> hi everybody! my laptop takes 11s to mount the swap .... any clue how can I reduce it?
[12:41] <MonkeyDust> eos  swapoff -a
[12:41] <olivia_> MonkeyDust I ran this: dd bs=1M if=2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb ------- but now I realise it was wrong, however i cannot mount/see the card anymore
[12:41] <Petaz> ther are no netinst isos for ubuntu?!
=== Catbuntu is now known as Neshemah
[12:42] <eos> MonkeyDust: that will dsiable the swap!
[12:42] <kainwrk> hello again ) with what command i can view which dns is used for resolving host?
[12:42] <olivia_> MonkeyDust any way to fix it?
[12:42] <MonkeyDust> olivia_  no clue, sorry
[12:42] <RBMW-CVT> I will repeat: [16:40]<RBMW-CVT> How much place is it needs to be installed?
[12:43] <eos> MonkeyDust: I do not need to disable it, I need to enable it but quicker .... :-D
[12:43] <olivia_> MonkeyDust no worries, thanks for trying :)

[12:45] <RBMW-CVT> I am from mobile:-X
[12:45] <dufa> Petaz: I'm not sure if its what you want, but there is a minimal 30MB iso for ubuntu, packages are downloaded during install
[12:45] <dufa> Petaz: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[12:46] <Petaz> must be it thx
[12:46] <Petaz> btw this should be the prefered metod of install
[12:46] <RBMW-CVT> There is a problem: my hard drive has only 4 Gb on it
[12:47] <olivia_>  I ran this on my SD card: dd bs=1M if=2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb ------- but now I realise it was wrong, however i cannot mount/see the card any more, anybody able to help? :)
[12:47] <Petaz> can i choose ubuntu studio using that ?
[12:48] <MonkeyDust> Petaz  start from the beginning, what are you trying to achieve
[12:49] <Jan1974> for the Sony Vaio with Windows 8 pre-installed and UEFI, do i need the EFI/Power-PC Ubuntu image? or does there exist a special image for that kind of UEFI secure-boot?
[12:49] <MonkeyDust> Petaz  and what have you tried before you came here
[12:49] <MonkeyDust> !uefi | start here
[12:49] <ubottu> start here: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI

[12:49] <ubottu> Jan1974 please see above
[12:50] <netchip> how can I fetch deb packages to install on my device (ARM) without internet connection?
[12:50] <Petaz> ive tryed nothing i dont do anything before im vceratian it will work out
[12:50] <Jan1974> thanks, i will have a look...
[12:51] <MonkeyDust> Petaz  it seems you are experimenting, nobody has ever tried what you are doing
[12:52] <Petaz> i find that hard to belive
[12:52] <Petaz> since its thre logical path to folow
[12:53] <Sanky> hello, after waking my system up from suspension, my laptop locks up completely after a few minutes.  I cannot enter the virtual terminal (ctrl+alt+f1) nor restart the X server (ctrl+alt+backspace).  this doesn't happen each time, but about 40% of the cases.  how can I debug this issue?
[12:53] <mahmoud_> my lap-top battary doesn't work on ubuntu 12.04 and I can't find this file /proc/acpi/battary
[12:54] <MonkeyDust> mahmoud_  bettery, not battary
[12:54] <olivia_> MonkeyDust battery, not bettery :P
[12:54] <_kud> Hello. I'd like to install ttfautohint but I don't see how to add the repo. Though, this website tells that it's already in official repos: http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-12.10/ubuntu-universe-i386/ttfautohint_0.9-1_i386.deb.html
[12:54] <_kud> any idea?
[12:54] <mahmoud_> MonkeyDust, yes thanks for fixing my typos :D
[12:54] <mahmoud_> mahmoud@MahmoudFaroukMachine:~$ ls /proc/acpi/battary
[12:54] <mahmoud_> ls: cannot access /proc/acpi/battary: No such file or directory
[12:55] <Petaz> lol @ MonkeyDust
[12:55] <MonkeyDust> mahmoud_  replace battary with battery in that command
[12:55] <_kud> Apparently you can get it there: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ttfautohint but I don't know the url of the repo

[12:56] <Petaz> olivia_:  you might want to take that to #debian
[12:56] <Kroach> what does the Pause/Break key do in Ubuntu?
[12:56] <Tashtego> hi. in the last days my system often freezes. i got ubuntu 12.04 LTS with latest updates. can anyone give hints? :(
[12:57] <olivia_> Petaz are they better at fixing SD cards? Will do.
[12:57] <Petaz> tashtego https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_poke
[12:57] <Petaz> ;-)
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[12:59] <Transhumanist> tashtega: I'd ignore what Petaz linked. It's not realted to your question.
[12:59] <Tashtego> thx Transfusion
[12:59] <Tashtego> thx Transhumanist
[12:59] <Transhumanist> So you were using what version before 12.04?
[12:59] <Tashtego> i guess if the system freezes there is no log where i can look for?
[13:00] <Creed> hello folks, I have a problem installing a wireless dongle on ubuntu hardy heron.  I've got the drivers but I can't understand how to install it.
[13:00] <Tashtego> i started with 12.04
[13:00] <Tashtego> new computer hardware. ssd hard disc
[13:00] <Tashtego> 8core cpu
[13:00] <Transhumanist> hmm.
[13:00] <Tashtego> maybe vga problems?
[13:00] <jay__> hash isn't working?
[13:00] <Tashtego> "AMD unsupported hardware" shows me
[13:00] <Transhumanist> I'd ask about it on the ubuntu forums. But which graphics driver are you using?
[13:01] <Creed> I've done lsusb and shows that the computer sees the dongle
[13:01] <cfhowlett> Creed: hardy?  EOL!!!!
[13:01] <jay__> \ ,<----- this comes up instead
[13:01] <jay__> foward slash
[13:01] <Tashtego> Transhumanist, the default ones i cant install amd vga drivers via "additional hardware"
[13:01] <Creed> hi cfhowlett , for me is the best ubuntu ever
[13:01] <Tashtego> always breaks with an error
[13:01] <Creed> the most stable of all
[13:01] <cfhowlett> Creed: ok then.
[13:02] <Creed> cfhowlett: can you help me?
[13:02] <cfhowlett> Creed: that said, I'd be surprised if you could actually get a wifi dongle to work.
[13:02] <cfhowlett> Creed: wish i could.  let me look real quick
[13:02] <Transhumanist> I dunno sorry, tash. If it were me, I might try some other versions like 12.10 or Xubuntu and see if the error recurrs. But if you get no response here, definitely try the ubuntu forums.
[13:02] <Creed> thanks cfhowlett
[13:03] <Transhumanist> http://ubuntuforums.org/
[13:03] <Tashtego> k thx
[13:03] <Petaz> how do i setup ipv6 nating?
[13:03] <MonkeyDust> Creed  fastest, easiest and cleanest would be fresh install -- backup first and consider creating a separate /home partition
[13:03] <olivia_>  I ran this on my SD card: dd bs=1M if=2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb ------- but now I realise it was wrong, however i cannot mount/see the card any more, anybody able to help? :)
[13:04] <Creed> MonkeyDust: mmm thanks but I'll rather buy a mac...
[13:04] <Transhumanist> separate home partition means you don't need backup personal data when reinstalling the OS, since the personal data is on another partition. fairly obvious, but worth mentioning
[13:04] <MonkeyDust> Creed  why not upgrade AND buy a Mac, so you have both?
[13:04] <Transhumanist> olivia: can you still see it in gparted?
[13:05] <Transhumanist> Why not dual-boot Ubuntu on the Mac? ;)
[13:05] <Transhumanist> but P.S. don't buy a mac. Buy a System76.
[13:05] <Petaz> System76? but its 13 fcol
[13:05] <Creed> MonkeyDust: thx for the advice, which sounds great but in a distant future...
[13:06] <MonkeyDust> what's 13 fcol?
[13:06] <Creed> cfhowlett: i've done lsusb
[13:06] <Petaz> year
[13:06] <Transhumanist> olivia: if you haven't got gparted, install it via apt-get or the Software Centre
[13:06] <Petaz> i thought you could make the connection...
[13:06] <Transhumanist> than, open it and see if you can find sdb
[13:06] <Creed> so if he sees it means that is a good start, or not?
[13:06] <Transhumanist> if you can, then just reformat it with fat or ext
[13:06] <cfhowlett> Creed: best I can suggest is you search for the "best wireless adapters for ubuntu" and use one of them.  backward engineering anything else on an EOL system isn't worth the time, IHO.
[13:07] <Syria> I cant ssh to my laptop from the LAN I get connection refused.
[13:07] <Petaz> FCOL For Crying Out Loud
[13:07] <Creed> cfhowlett: how
[13:07] <Creed> i've got everything cfhowlett
[13:07] <Creed> drivers and terminal
[13:07] <Creed> what else do i need?
[13:08] <Transhumanist> is SSH installed on the host machine, Syria?
[13:08] <Transhumanist> silly question, but... ;)
[13:08] <cfhowlett> Creed: OK.  what make/model?
[13:08] <Syria> Transhumanist:  Yes, openssh-client
[13:08] <Transhumanist> http://askubuntu.com/questions/30080/how-to-solve-connection-refused-errors-in-ssh-connection
[13:08] <Creed> cfhowlett: of...?
[13:08] <cfhowlett> Creed: the dongle
[13:09] <Creed> ok...it's a 3072 Ralink Technology, Corp
[13:09] <Syria> Transhumanist:  It didn't work, I don't have an IP address conflict.
[13:09] <Benxyzzy> exit
[13:09] <Benxyzzy> aw
[13:09] <Transhumanist> is it possible to restart both devices and then confirm that the ssh service is running on the host machine after restart?
[13:09] <Creed> Bus 004 Device 005: ID 148f:3072 Ralink Technology, Corp
[13:10] <Syria> Transhumanist:  I can ssh into other computers, But I can't ssh into my computer! It means that ssh is working right?
[13:11] <cfhowlett> Creed: LOTS of entries on that model failing under 8.04
[13:11] <Syria> Transhumanist:  "pgrep ssh" gives 1372 & 3366
[13:11] <MonkeyDust> Syria  to ssh *into*, you need to have openssh-server installed on that pc
[13:12] <Syria> MonkeyDust: I see! I have installed openssh-client only.
[13:12] <cfhowlett> Creed: see the final entry in this thread ... FIXED  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1565165

[13:18] <Creed> sorry...
[13:18] <Creed> from what I read of the link you showed me, I couldn't get te final solution
[13:18] <Creed> did you?
[13:19] <cfhowlett> Creed: wait one ... china internet is SLOOOOW
[13:20] <cfhowlett> Creed: THIS thread is where the fix actually happened.  Of course, this WAS on 11.04 so YMMV
[13:22] <Creed> cfhowlett: so what do I have to do
[13:22] <Creed> what do I have to type into the terminal
[13:22] <Creed> give me something to type in
[13:22] <cfhowlett> Creed: I'd suggest you try it out exactly as written and see what results you get
[13:22] <Creed> pls
[13:23] <Transhumanist> Oh Rimmer... you're such a smeghead.

[13:25] <Coffeecoco> lol
[13:25] <Creed> yes, and very well, but you wrote "/\"

[13:27] <Creed> ehm... I really appreciate your will to help me cfhowlett, do you know somebody that has got more experience?
[13:27] <Syria> How can I poweroff several machines at one time? When the employees go home somethimes they forget their computers running!
[13:28] <Coffeecoco> set a cron job
[13:28] <Coffeecoco> timmer
[13:28] <Coffeecoco> shutdown
[13:28] <Creed> however whatever you told me to type, doesn't give back anything cfhowlett
[13:28] <cfhowlett> Creed: stay in channel and keep asking.  I'm know LOTS of people come through with more experience than me.  Best of luck
[13:28] <compdoc> Syria, what if an employee is working late?
[13:29] <Syria> compdoc:  I know who is working late, And when he is not I want to send a command to shutdown the pc.
[13:29] <Syria> Coffeecoco:  The time is different! not always in the same time.
[13:29] <iwkse> Syria: that's easier, just connect though ssh and shutdown the machine
[13:29] <sroecker> iwkse, https://live.gnome.org/Planner
[13:29] <netchip> bwah
[13:30] <Syria> iwkse:  I have more than 35 computers in my LAN
[13:30] <iwkse> sroecker: there's something less "complicated" than planner?
[13:30] <compdoc> Syria, you can do that with ssh
[13:30] <compdoc> ah
[13:30] <iwkse> Syria: well pay someone to do that
[13:30] <netchip> how can I fetch on my x86 PC, an ARMHF package + those dependencies? I hate manually downlaoding packages and all dependencies...
[13:30] <Syria> iwkse:  :( I am being paid to do that.
[13:30] <iwkse> so work!
[13:31] <skillico> ha
[13:31] <Petaz> outsource
[13:31] <Coffeecoco> Syria the time on the pc is different?
[13:31] <Creed> hello folks, I have a problem installing a wireless dongle on ubuntu hardy heron.  I've got the drivers but I can't understand how to install it.
[13:31] <iwkse> Syria: there are things that can't be easily automated
[13:31] <Creed> can you help me to install the drivers?
[13:31] <Creed> from terminal? Thanks
[13:31] <Coffeecoco> Syria f the time on the pc is differnet then you need to sync the time with ntp
[13:31] <Syria> Coffeecoco: I mean, Sometimes I have to turnoff the pc's at 3 pm and sometimes at 4 and so on..
[13:31] <iwkse> well you could still design something interesting, like sensors on the chairs
[13:31] <Coffeecoco> oh ic
[13:32] <iwkse> so you know when someone is sit there
[13:33] <Petaz> just use flash player to spy on them using the laptops cam
[13:33] <Syria> I heard that cssh can give the same command to many several machines!! but when i used it all I got was many open windows at the same time!
[13:33] <Coffeecoco> Syria is it win or nix pc?
[13:33] <Syria> Coffeecoco:  Ubuntu pc.
[13:33] <skillico> so, downloaded windows 8, used it to download ubuntu
[13:33] <sroecker> iwkse: maybe http://taskcoach.org/
[13:33] <skillico> and i love it
[13:33] <iwkse> sroecker: thanks i'll give a look
[13:33] <Petaz> i used freedos to download ubuntgu
[13:33] <Coffeecoco> Syria maybe create a ssh script with the ip's let it run ssh login and run shut down
[13:34] <Syria> Coffeecoco:  I am using net school support with windows machines and it works perfectly.
[13:34] <Coffeecoco> simple^
[13:34] <skillico> never heard of, but sounds like commandline
[13:34] <skillico> xhat really needs a new dockingicon
[13:34] <skillico> chat*
[13:35] <skillico> its horrible
[13:35] <Syria> Coffeecoco: Is it an easy thing to write scripts like that ! do you know where I can find a tutorial please!
[13:35] <sroecker> Creed: what's the problem? did you get the drivers as a .deb or .tar.gz? are they kernel modules or nswrapper drivers?
[13:35] <Petaz> skillico: the CLI is your friend if you want to break free from UNITY hell
[13:35] <iwkse> Syria: to me the best solution is putting a fine to workers who forget to shutdown the system.
[13:35] <skillico> btw. anyone here know if ubuntu is ready for hidpi screens?
[13:35] <iwkse> you'll see the won't forget after a while
[13:35] <Syria> iwkse:  I am just an IT guy, I don't hire employees.
[13:36] <iwkse> Syria: i see, but it's an idea you could show
[13:36] <Creed> sroecker: I've got the drivers on a mini cd autorun
[13:36] <bkc_> Petaz: wrong, anything other than unity is your friend if you wanna break free from unity hell...
[13:36] <bkc_> Petaz: doesn't have to be CLI...
[13:36] <sroecker> Creed: so you got windows drivers?
[13:36] <Creed> sroecker: yep, win, mac, linux
[13:37] <mgedmin> I find myself trying to upgrade an ubuntu 8.10 desktop according to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades/Intrepid
[13:37] <sroecker> Creed: and are the linux drivers open source? maybe there's already a kernel module
[13:38] <Creed> sroecker: I've completely no idea

[13:38] <k1l> mgedmin: wow a 8.10 i would really consider a new isntall there
[13:38] <auronandace> mgedmin: you'd be better off fresh installing

[13:39] <Creed> ok
[13:39] <mgedmin> the owner tried to make a bootable USB key of the latest release and it failed to boot
[13:39] <Petaz> hey the stable kernel has just been updated
[13:39] <cfhowlett> mgedmin: do you mean specifically 8.10 to 9.04?
[13:39] <Petaz> .6 is the new one
[13:39] <bkc_> mgedmin: do you know if the date on the server is correct? as the keys are dated :)
[13:39] <Coffeecoco> Syria
[13:39] <Coffeecoco> You need to set up public key authentication on remote computers so it will not ask for password.
[13:40] <Coffeecoco> Then you will be able to issue remote command over ssh, like this:
[13:40] <mgedmin> cfhowlett, yeah, my plan is to plod boringly along 8.10->9.04->9.10->10.04->12.04
[13:40] <Coffeecoco> ssh root@remote_computer "shutdown -h now"
[13:40] <Creed> sroecker: it's a realtek semiconductor
[13:40] <mgedmin> bkc_, the clock is fine -- but maybe interpid's archive gpg key has expired?
[13:40] <Coffeecoco> put last bit into a sh script and run it obviously change it to the machine address
[13:40] <Creed> (the computer in question is not the one I'm talking from)
[13:40] <olivia_> anybody able to help me with my sd card, here is dmesg output: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4628444/dmesg_output.txt
[13:41] <auronandace> mgedmin: 8.10, 9.04 and 9.10 are end of life, why weren't they upgraded when they were supported?
[13:41] <cfhowlett> mgedmin: sounds ... painful.  Y U NO just clean install to current release.
[13:41] <bkc_> mgedmin: can you paste the output somewhere?  <command> |& curl -F sprunge=@- sprunge.us

[13:43] <Coffeecoco> Petaz it was good tri tho :P
[13:43] <Creed> ehm..
[13:43] <Coffeecoco> coulda been a bug and worked...
[13:43] <mgedmin> bkc_, cfhowlett, I'd love to; do you have any suggestions how I might do that, remotely?
[13:43] <skillico> cfhowlett: okay, you just "contribute"? im mainly a ux/ui designer and work a lot with web-stuff, im not talking about making forum signatures
[13:44] <skillico> MonkeyDust: thats where i started
[13:44] <k1l> Coffeecoco: keep this channel clean for real support please
[13:44] <Creed> sroecker: do you want me to connect it now?
[13:44] <Coffeecoco> ok

[13:44] <bkc_> mgedmin: ooh, remotely... do you have multiple partitions? :P
[13:44] <sroecker> Creed: yes, is it a usb card? then you need to look what lsusb shows
[13:44] <bkc_> mgedmin: anyways, the error seems to indicate a correct download, have you tried it again? :)
[13:44] <Creed> ok
[13:45] <mgedmin> bkc_, yes, a few times -- also tried do-release-upgrade -p, just to see what it would do; same error
[13:45] <MonkeyDust> skillico  what you can do, create an app, make a .deb or ppa, post it on a blog or forum and hope someone picks it up

[13:45] <bkc_> mgedmin: tried setting a higher verbosity-level and se if it spits out more info? :)
[13:45] <Creed> ok
[13:46] <mgedmin> bkc_, I don't see any flags to set a higher verbosity level :(
[13:46] <cfhowlett> bkc_: this is WAY over my level, but could you do a PXE boot?

[13:46] <skillico> MonkeyDust: I've never used ubuntu earlier, and just loved whats happening these days, I'm not talking about actually writing apps but would be happy to contribute with ui/ux work, user behaviour, etc. (http://skilli.co)
[13:46] <bkc_> cfhowlett: uhm, yes but totaly unrelated as a standard PXE boot still requires physical access :)
[13:47] <skillico> cfhowlett: thanks!
[13:47] <cfhowlett> bkc_: as I said, way over my level.  So that won't work.
[13:47] <cfhowlett> skillico: best of luck
[13:47] <niarbeht> Sooooo, is anyone here good at messing with the grub2 configuration scripts?  Or know somewhere to go to get good information?  I've googled around in the past and met with pain.  In particular, I'd like to edit the scripts so it generates an extra entry for it's detected Linux OS thingies where certain specific grub command thingies are executed first.
[13:47] <k1l> mgedmin: can you post you sources.list?
[13:47] <iwkse> olivia_: http://askubuntu.com/questions/132100/errors-in-dmesg-test-wp-failed-assume-write-enabled
[13:48] <bkc_> cfhowlett: I was more thinking along the line of installing to a separate partition, setting grub/whatnot to the new installation, wiping the old installation, done :)
[13:48] <MonkeyDust> skillico  then maybe this is what you want http://www.canonical.com/about-canonical/careers

[13:50] <mgedmin> the bootable USB key was created with usb-creator and it fails to boot even in kvm
[13:50] <sroecker> Creed: hmm, your are using hardy, right?
[13:50] <sroecker> this kernel is rather old
[13:50] <bkc_> cfhowlett: why not? bootstrap the new installation, chroot and set it up, fix grub, reboot, wipe old and stretch the partition :)
[13:50] <mgedmin> hey, can I dd a recent ubuntu .iso onto a usb key and have it boot?
[13:50] <mgedmin> I heard it works for Fedora

[13:51] <cfhowlett> bkc_: but if you can do it >>> Color me impressed.
[13:51] <Creed> sroecker: is there not a way to solve this without touching hardy>
[13:51] <sroecker> sroecker: http://wiki.debian.org/rt2870sta debian supports this since 2.6.29 but I guess you have 2.6.24
[13:51] <bkc_> cfhowlett: that's how you normally install ArchLinux nowadays so I'm forced to do it anyway :)
[13:52] <olivia_> iwkse I ran this on my SD card: dd bs=1M if=2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb ------- but now I realise it was wrong, however i cannot mount/see the card any more, anybody able to help? :)
[13:52] <k1l> mgedmin: can you pastebin a "lsb_release -a"?
[13:52] <Creed> sroecker: how can I know what kernel is
[13:52] <Creed> ?
[13:52] <cfhowlett> mgedmin: ubuntu has a startup disk creator JUST for making boot USB's.  or use netbootin.  Not sure that dd'ing the ISO only will create a bootable media
[13:52] <sroecker> Creed: uname -a
[13:52] <sroecker> uname -r shows only the kernel version
[13:52] <Creed> 2.6.24-19 generic

[13:53] <mgedmin> ssh is very laggy because I'm test-booting the USB key in kvm over remote X ;)
[13:54] <Creed> sroecker: ok,
[13:54] <mgedmin> cfhowlett, that's usb-creator, which was used for this non-functional usb key; I guess it was just buggy way back in 2008
[13:54] <Creed> if i use this wireless dongle on a younger version of ubuntu how do I install it
[13:54] <k1l> mgedmin: i saw some commented jaunty repo lines in the sources.list. so maybe the system is confused about its own state
[13:54] <mgedmin> I see a few lines of aubergine in KVM; I guess that means I can dd the iso straight to a USB disk!
[13:54] <olivia_> I ran this on my SD card: dd bs=1M if=2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of=/dev/sdb ------- but now I realise it was wrong, however i cannot mount/see the card any more, anybody able to help? here is dmesg output: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4628444/dmesg_output.txt

[15:15] <mgedmin> ah, actually, Intel messed things up a bit by releasing some PowerVR-based ("Poulsbo") GMA500 and related chips that are very poorly supported in Ubuntu

[15:17] <Chanel> why do they have to post hostnames
[15:17] <Chanel> when some1  joins
[15:18] <adamk> If you register your nick, it won't post your hostname or IP address.
[15:18] <Chanel> ohh ok
[15:18] <Chanel> well i dont have a problem with that
[15:18] <Chanel> the thing is it hoggs the screen
[15:19] <Chanel> BTW Wubi wont help for minimal installation right?
[15:19] <k1l> Chanel: use a real irc client instead of webchat, which can hide the join and parts

[15:27] <acovrig> is is possible to install ubuntu server from a 128M usb (network install)?
=== Guest46491 is now known as TxuS
[15:27] <usr13> malik_: 10.10 reached End Of Life April 10, 2012
[15:27] <Chanel> 128M USB do they still exist ?
[15:28] <to_be_determined> weird... i can see all the chat activity through the webchat.freenode site, but using xchat... cannot see anything.
[15:28] <acovrig> Chanel: I have a 128M and 32G, but really don't feel like formatting the 32G
[15:28] <CrazyGangster> well asked! xD
[15:28] <usr13> malik_: If you have /home/ on a separate partition, you can do a 12.04-LTS install and leave /home/ as is.
[15:28] <acovrig> Chanel: never mind, its a 256, but do u know if it's possible?
[15:29] <usr13> malik_: Otherwise, back-up home and do fresh install.

[15:29] <malik_> I can do a fresh install but how do i manage a internet sharing ? is it automatic on 12.10 ?
[15:31] <Nikita19> do i have to format the drive before i can install 12.04
[15:31] <usr13> !firewall | malik_
[15:31] <ubottu> malik_: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.
[15:31] <malik_> i actually tried 12.04 LTS, but my system was lagging and hanging spontaneously, so i switched back, I have a rather old machine, 2,4Ghz quad core with 4GB Ram and 512MB Graphic card.

[15:33] <usr13> malik_: But will need to do it through your LAN port and I'm sure that will not work for your situation, so what you need is a wireless router as well.
[15:33] <Guest23089> i some problems with syslinux,,,not work..
[15:34] <usr13> malik_: But would have to know a bit more about the specific's of how you actually connect.

=== geudrik is now known as geudrik|AFK
[15:35] <usr13> malik_: In other words, you can do ICS through the LAN port of your PC, but from there, you'll prolly need a WiFi router plugged into it in order to do exactly what you request.
[15:36] <malik_> usr13,  I connecto to the WLAN by right clikcing the Network Icon and choose Hidden Network, Type in the SSID and Secure Key for WPA2 Personal, Then i use pppoeconfing to connect through pppoe using my user account/password.

[15:38] <Guest23089> my pendrive not load anymore syslinux now...only grub,,,,,,i need this load if not load a distro linux..
[15:38] <usr13> malik_: Connect via your Desktop, share it over the LAN port, plug a WiFi router into the LAN port and share from there to your other WiFi devices.
[15:38] <malik_> OK, then thank you for your help. I will try this and get back if i have to ask further question..
[15:38] <k1l> Nikita19: but if you consider a lightwight desktop you should try lubuntu
[15:38] <Guest23089> how i repair it_

[16:10] <devvrat> how to root the ubuntu??
[16:10] <llutz> !root | devvrat
[16:10] <ubottu> devvrat: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo

[16:17] <Aeyoun> Maybe the package is broken.
[16:17] <set_killer> bekks: i have found that http://pingbin.com/2011/02/ubuntu-eth0-missing-after-reboot/
[16:17] <Hank___> devvrat, no dpkg or it does not work
[16:18] <Hank___> ?
[16:18] <bwellsnc> I figured I would ask this in here, I have a motorola razr hd and I am needing to connect this to my machine.  I have followed the documents on xda-developers, and none of these have worked.  The mtpfs option is the only option on this phone.  I have been told that the problem in the android channel that it's because linux is trailing to far behind on MTPFS.
[16:18] <devvrat> dpkg dosent working
[16:19] <Aeyoun> devvrat: any error messages?
[16:19] <set_killer> bekks: will it help?
[16:19] <bekks> set_killer: Then try it.
[16:19] <usr13> set_killer: That article is too old to be useful. Disregard
[16:20] <nullby7e> where is inittab in 12.10
[16:20] <nullby7e> ?
[16:20] <bekks> usr13: Which is not true again.
[16:20] <bekks> usr13: persistent net rules is exactly ONE current reason for a renamed eth0 interface.
[16:20] <bekks> set_killer: I'd give it a shot.
[16:21] <set_killer> okey :)

[16:23] <devvrat> ubuntu working slow ....any reasion??
[16:24] <ubuntu___> no
[16:24] <usr13> bekks: You are correct
[16:24] <atlef> devvrat, full install, wubi, vbox or?
[16:24] <WHO_A_HOE> i am not in ubuntu but i am having issues with alsa and i can't join the ##linux because when i type #linux it comes out ##linux
[16:24] <magik_> if your using wubi devvrat it's gonna be slow.
[16:24] <set_killer> bekks: mmm, it didn't helped
[16:24] <devvrat> full install
[16:24] <bhavesh> devvrat: 12.04, 12.10, DE?
=== King_Wizzard is now known as Like
[16:25] <devvrat> 12.10
[16:25] <set_killer> bekks: the MAC address is static, however
[16:25] <Aeyoun> Is devvrat an auto-troll? His behaviour is erratic and focus span seems to be only a minute.
[16:25] <BluesKaj> devvrat, file indexewr on ?
[16:25] <devvrat> whats that
[16:25] <usr13> bekks: But there is probably another reason for the problem he encountered.
[16:25] <bhavesh> devvrat: Unity on 12.10 tends to be slower than 12.04
[16:25] <devvrat> i m just new user
[16:25] <ti89breh> is there any way to donate to users who have helped you resolve serious problems with ubuntu that could have hurt your business if not for their help
[16:25] <devvrat> i downt know any thing
[16:25] <zakkotron> how to install gtk latest version
[16:25] <seednode> ti89breh: Send them Bitcoins ^^
[16:25] <nullby7e> where is inittab in ubuntu?
[16:26] <usr13> bekks: So you had him barking up the wrong tree.
[16:26] <nomike> ti89breh, send the money to me, I will take care of the rest
[16:26] <Aeyoun> ti89breh, ask for their amazon wishlist. :-)
[16:26] <Coffeecoco> bitcoins hehe
[16:26] <ti89breh> usr13, ^^ do you have bitcoin
[16:26] <Coffeecoco> is that the new currency?
[16:26] <nomike> ti89breh, ;-)
[16:26] <WHO_A_HOE> so i'm screwed
[16:26] <ti89breh> hahah nomike sounds good to me
[16:26] <philinux> bwellsnc: have you got mtpfs installed on your machine?
[16:26] <usr13> ti89breh: NO, what is a bitcoin?
[16:26] <Coffeecoco> its virtual money used to buy drugs :P lawl
[16:27] <ti89breh> usr13, remember you helped me resolve a problem with my /home dir not mounting? do you have paypal ?
[16:27] <seednode> ti89breh: But yeah, you could (depending on interests) gift them a Steam game they want, order them something they want from Amazon/ebay to a PO box
[16:27] <bekks> usr13: Yes, but with a totally legitimate reason - and because YOUR reason for not barking up that tree was simply wrong, which you admitted. So let's move on now.
[16:27] <bhavesh> devvrat: Unity, the default Desktop Environment tends to run "a lot" slower on Ubuntu 12.10 as compared to 12.04, If its unacceptably slow, try using Gnome Shell instead.
[16:27] <usr13> ti89breh: haha  ok yea.
[16:27] <Coffeecoco> i appologise it can be used for legit purpose
[16:27] <k1l> WHO_A_HOE: ask in #freenode if you have problems with the freenode network
[16:27] <devvrat> tring...and thanks
[16:28] <atlef> philinux, thx, did not know about that one
[16:28] <ti89breh> pm ;-)
[16:28] <WHO_A_HOE> ok
[16:28] <seednode> Coffeecoco: Fair enough, but it's commonly accepted that drugs and other illicit orders dominate the BTC usage
[16:28] <usr13> ti89breh: See my PM.
[16:28] <Coffeecoco> seednode of coarse :) not that i do it
[16:28] <magik_> bhavesh, Can you still run gnome on 12.10 64bit?
[16:28] <philinux> atlef: not sure if it installed by default or I installed it. It's in the repo but I've slept since
[16:28] <seednode> Someone gifted me 2BTC for Christmas
[16:28] <seednode> It was nice
[16:29] <Coffeecoco> but i think the bitcoint thing is good as long as its not exploited or anything
[16:29] <bhavesh> magik_: ? You mean to say gnome-shell?
[16:29] <bhavesh> magik_: Why won't you be able to?
[16:29] <magik_> bhavesh, yeah
[16:29] <bhavesh> magik_: yes
[16:29] <Aeyoun> user82, any idea about my packaging problem? I have kind of hit a dead end and don't know where to turn.
[16:30] <magik_> bhavesh, I thought I remember reading in some forum someone said if you been using unity and goto gnome you might run into some configuration problems is that true
[16:30] <ti89breh> sent $5,000 thks again for helping me resolve the issue
[16:30] <bhavesh> magik_: Well, i haven't experienced any such problem
[16:30] <Coffeecoco> ti89breh lol
[16:30] <usr13> Aeyoun: Not sure.  Don't have enough information.  But there are some things you can try.  apt-get install -f
[16:31] <atlef> philinux, i had problems connecting my phone, now it is solved after installing it, so thx
[16:31] <magik_> bhavesh, well I'm using 12.10 64bit I've used gnome shell before but if I switch now is it going to affect anything I should be aware about?
[16:31] <magik_> bhavesh, I meant I used gnome shell on a different cpu haven't tried on this one.
[16:31] <bhavesh> magik_: Nope.
[16:31] <usr13> Aeyoun: apt-get update
[16:32] <magik_> Well I might switch back to gnome then because I like Unity but I can't stand the login screen and having to change remote users uid to under 1000 to hide them kind of a annoyance.
[16:33] <set_killer> hhmmm guys, do i need ethtools or something like that ?
[16:33] <philinux> atlef: I must have done the same thing last year then lol
[16:33] <Hank___> back
[16:33] <bekks> set_killer: I'd doublecheck the config.
[16:33] <Hank___> still touchpad problem... Lifebook A512
[16:34] <Hank___> there is an area both bottom and right to scrolling screen
[16:34] <Hank___> but it does not work
[16:34] <Hank___> I can  now see the settings too for touchpad
[16:35] <Hank___> but there is no effect of the scroll area
[16:35] <user82> Aeyoun, packing?
[16:35] <set_killer> bekks: /etc/networking/interfaces is okey and  'ifup eth0' reads that file and then i have internet. But should i run ifup eth0 everytime after restart
[16:36] <speedmastery> sorry but is this a help channel for ubuntu

[16:39] <kunji> I have an obnoxious wireless issue.  I'm not sure if it is because of my new router, or a kernel update or something else.  The machine is running Ubuntu 12.04 64-bit Kernel 3.2.0-35-generic and the wireless device is a Realtek RTL8191SEvA, after a seemingly random amount of time the wireless stops working and also seems to stop the wireless from working for the entire band (the router does 2.4 and 5 GHz).  Disconnecting and reconnecting on the machine lets ever
[16:39] <speedmastery> i installed linux source header  did run source update and  driver show in additional driver tap but when i aktivate them dont work

[16:49] <user82> speedmastery, can you post the output of "lsmod | grep -i nvidia". then you can see wether or not the installation worked and the driver is running
[16:49] <Wiz_KeeD> has anyone here installed a squid http proxy server?
[16:49] <Wiz_KeeD> i need some help with access lists :(
[16:51] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD, sorry, only done basic PHProxy setups
[16:51] <seednode> Nothing more indepth than that
[16:51] <Wiz_KeeD> phproxy hah...nice
[16:51] <Wiz_KeeD> well i managed to allow all connection but now i just need restriction per password or smth
[16:52] <usr13> speedmastery: Do you have /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
[16:53] <usr13> speedmastery: Did you run  nvidia-xconfig ?
[16:58] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD: Maybe use a proxy without that functionality and just make your entire site password-protected
[16:59] <seednode> Assuming that's a thing; not actually sure about that
[16:59] <Wiz_KeeD> i do not have a static ip and i need to make a proxy that retreives data from a site that allows access only to certain ip's
[16:59] <Wiz_KeeD> and the server i'm installing the proxy on is one
[17:00] <xdhanix30> buonasera
[17:00] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD: I can look into it
[17:01] <Wiz_KeeD> thanks man
[17:01] <Wiz_KeeD> i've managed to set it up so i can access basic sites
[17:01] <Wiz_KeeD> but this is a web interface that runs on port 8069 i don't know if that's the problem
[17:01] <xdhanix30> I've a problem with ubuntu installation
[17:02] <xdhanix30> everyone can help me?
[17:02] <seednode> If I understand properly, Wiz_KeeD, squid doesn't natively support that; you need a "helper" program
[17:02] <sophusn> xdhanix30, you are on the #ubuntu channel - if we dont know your problem/question - we cant help you
[17:04] <Wiz_KeeD> ah shit...helper program to do what?
[17:04] <Wiz_KeeD> run web transfer on different ports?
[17:04] <seednode> Wait, go over again what exactly you're trying to do
[17:04] <sophusn> xdhanix30, dont pm me... ask your question here, so all the other people can helping answer
[17:04] <dalsgaard> Has anyone else had problems in 12.10 with lagging windows when you drag them? I've been googling frantically, and it looks like it's a compiz problem. I haven't been able to find a solution yet.
[17:04] <seednode> dalsgaard, what specs are you running on?
[17:05] <dalsgaard> Intel centrino dual-core 2.4ghz, with a Geforce 240M with 1GB RAM. Should be perfectly capable. :)
[17:06] <seednode> 1GB RAM total?, or the GPU has 1GB RAM
[17:06] <dalsgaard> GPU has
[17:06] <dalsgaard> Right now my swap is not even in use, so... Plenty of RAM available
[17:07] <imothy> what driver are you using for the gpu
[17:07] <Wiz_KeeD> seednode, there is a OpenERP instance (ERP system with web-interface or web service gateway interface) that runs on port 8069...it works brilliant on localhost and over the network with no problems.The issue here is that the place where it is hosted has a firewall that filters based on ip and since i don't have a static ip at home or at work i need to access it via a ubuntu server which has a static ip and is placed in the filtering there
[17:07] <dalsgaard> imothy, not sure, how do I check?
[17:07] <Wiz_KeeD> My intuition was that if i installed a proxy server on the static ip server i could access the OpenERP wsgi via browser and proxy
[17:07] <dalsgaard> I think it's 301 something. Properietary drivers
[17:07] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD, yes, your intuition seems to be correct there
[17:08] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD: However, I'm trying to figure out if there's an easier solution, one sec
[17:08] <Wiz_KeeD> yeah well it seems to work for most sites
[17:08] <Wiz_KeeD> but just this one no
[17:08] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD, honestly, I'd recommend using an SSH tunnel over a proxy server
[17:08] <Wiz_KeeD> with ssh i do the same...i ssh to the static-ip server then i ssh to the main server
[17:08] <seednode> Same effect for you, and less work
[17:08] <Wiz_KeeD> how will that transfer http data to my browser?
[17:08] <seednode> You can forward all port (40, I think, whatever HTTP uses) traffic over SSH
[17:08] <seednode> So your web traffic goes through the server
[17:09] <kunji> 80 is HTTP
[17:09] <seednode> Alright, that one
[17:09] <Wiz_KeeD> i need 8069
[17:09] <seednode> Haven't dealt with ports too often
[17:09] <Wiz_KeeD> ok and how do i do that?
[17:09] <seednode> Alright, then forward that port
[17:09] <seednode> Alright, first, which OS are you using on your client side?
[17:09] <Wiz_KeeD> is it easier than proxy server like squid?
[17:09] <Wiz_KeeD> all servers including localhost ubuntu 12.04 LTS
[17:09] <seednode> Should be, just requires a single line, a browser plugin, and PuTTY if Windows
[17:10] <seednode> I funnel all of my internet traffic through a VPS
[17:10] <Wiz_KeeD> no putty i'm on ubuntu
[17:10] <Wiz_KeeD> so how can we go about this?
[17:10] <Wiz_KeeD> i'll uninstall quid then
[17:10] <seednode> Don't uninstall yet
[17:10] <seednode> In case my idea fails, but it should almost certainly work
[17:11] <fishtails> :)
[17:11] <seednode> Alright, so, the syntax is "ssh -D 12345 myuser@remote_ssh_server"
[17:11] <imothy> dalsgaard this might help https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
[17:11] <seednode> Where 12345 is the port you want to forward to on your machine, and the others are fairly self-explanatory
[17:11] <Wiz_KeeD> that's it?
[17:11] <dalsgaard> Thanks imothy , I'll check it out. I just tried sudo apt-get install nvidia-current-updates
[17:12] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD, that's the general syntax
[17:12] <Wiz_KeeD> and how do i access my local computer if i'm behind a router?
[17:12] <imothy> good idea
[17:12] <limac> how can I fix this: while compiling a cpp file with boost/asio.hpp, i get /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lboost_asio
[17:12] <dalsgaard> I should get version 304.51 now.
[17:12] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD: Alright, to confirm: The server that CAN access the IP-restricted one has a static IP, and SSH server?
[17:12] <limac> i included -lboost_asio in the g++ options
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> yes sir it has
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> all correct
[17:13] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD, and you have access to SSH on the server that can access the restricted one?
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> yes sir
[17:13] <dalsgaard> By the way, do I have to reboot my whole computer after installing the nvidia drivers, or is there a way to just reboot X?
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> that's how i installed squid in the first place
[17:13] <seednode> Which port are you forwarding?
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> via ssh
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> 8069
[17:13] <Sven_vB> hi there! :) my ssh connection to a quantal live CD environment gets really slow when the live system is left alone for a while. moving its physical mouse a bit instantly cures this. (as opposed to the simulated mouse movemens that i let xdotool do every few seconds to at least keep the screen awake since the screen standby setting doesn't work.) well, why does ssh get so slow? randomness is already refilled quickly using haveged, so at least
[17:13] <seednode> Also, which browser are you using?
[17:13] <Sven_vB>  that should not be a reason to require mouse movements. are there other ways to keep it awake?
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> firefox and chrome-stable
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> i'm on ubuntu 12.04 lts localhost
[17:13] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD, then the SSH command is "ssh -D 8069 myuser@remote_ssh_server", and you'll want foxyProxy addon for Firefox
[17:13] <Wiz_KeeD> so are the other 2 servers
[17:14] <Wiz_KeeD> i run this on my localhost right?
[17:14] <seednode> You run that command with your username and the server that CAN access the restricted site
[17:14] <Wiz_KeeD> ok sir one seccond
[17:14] <Wiz_KeeD> waiting for squid to uninstall and purge
[17:14] <seednode> So, say your username on there is Wiz, and the server IP is 5.5.5.5; it'd be "ssh -D 8069 Wiz@5.5.5.5"
[17:14] <Wiz_KeeD> never really knew 100% what apt-get remove --purge does
[17:14] <Wiz_KeeD> yep!
[17:15] <seednode> Then, install FoxyProxy on your local machine
[17:16] <kunji> You mean as opposed to remove?  It additionally removes configuration files that remove would leave in case you installed again and didn't want to do your custom config all over.
[17:17] <efes> hello :)
[17:18] <efes> I can't remove postgresql. Neither apt-get update, nor upgrade, nor apt-get -f install helps. Log: http://pastie.org/5627241
[17:18] <Wiz_KeeD> one seccond seednode
[17:19] <Wiz_KeeD> now what?
[17:19] <seednode> Do you have FoxyProxy installed
[17:19] <Wiz_KeeD> it has logged in via the terminal and i installed foxyproxy
[17:19] <Wiz_KeeD> yes sir
[17:20] <seednode> Alright, so open Firefox and go to FoxyProxy's config
[17:20] <Wiz_KeeD> i just opened tool addons and searched foxyproxy
[17:20] <Wiz_KeeD> now i'm in
[17:20] <seednode> Go to FoxyProxy's options
[17:21] <Wiz_KeeD> i have select mode, proxies, proxies subscriptions
[17:21] <Wiz_KeeD> global settings
[17:21] <seednode> Add New PRoxy
[17:21] <Wiz_KeeD> right
[17:21] <seednode> Manual PRoxy Configuration
[17:21] <Wiz_KeeD> i add the ip
[17:21] <Hank___> Any idea how to assign LCD brightness to FN+F6/F7  instead of the FN+F4?
[17:21] <Wiz_KeeD> port 8069?
[17:21] <seednode> IP 127.0.0.1, port 8069 or whatever you wanted
[17:21] <Hank___> Ubuntu 12.10
[17:22] <Wiz_KeeD> so the localhost ip

[17:22] <The_Jag> I have the need to mount some folders on my NAS onto the system.
[17:22] <Wiz_KeeD> now what?
[17:22] <seednode> Go the URL patterns tab, and remove localhost from the blacklist
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest62799
[17:22] <Wiz_KeeD> there is nothing in the blacklist
[17:22] <seednode> Alright
[17:22] <ben_> hey everyone- I have 12.10 installed and working well, but I have the no sound on resume issue. I've googled that a fix can lie in alsamixer, disabling "auto mute", but in MY alsamixer the option is simply not there.. can anyone help with this?
[17:22] <seednode> Now, trying to remember exactly what you were connecting to
[17:23] <seednode> An IP, a website, a localhost port for a webUI?
[17:23] <Wiz_KeeD> You didn't enter and enable any whitelisted (inclusive) URL patterns. This means the proxy won't be used unless FoxyProxy is set to "Use Proxy for all URLs". Continue anyway
[17:23] <seednode> Yep
[17:23] <Wiz_KeeD> now what
[17:24] <seednode> What're you trying to connectly, exactly?
[17:24] <seednode> connect to*; working on multiple things, losing track
[17:24] <Wiz_KeeD> sorry?
[17:24] <seednode> One sec
[17:25] <seednode> Try connecting to the site that restricts IPs
[17:25] <Wiz_KeeD> i am
[17:25] <Wiz_KeeD> it's loading constantly and nothing happens
[17:25] <seednode> Hm... one sec.
[17:25] <seednode> Need to make sure I forwarded ports properly
[17:26] <seednode> OH, also, on the FoxyPRoxy config, you need to Socks proxy -> Socks5
[17:26] <seednode> Forgot that part
[17:28] <efes> Re, re :) I can't remove postgresql. Neither apt-get update, nor upgrade, nor apt-get -f install helps. Log: http://pastie.org/5627241
[17:28] <Wiz_KeeD> i added that

[17:29] <seednode> Wiz_KeeD, you just paraphrased what should happen. Is there any extenuating circumstance that would stop it from happening?
[17:29] <Wiz_KeeD> i didn't specify the server's ip anywhere
[17:29] <seednode> Well, if you connect to it in Firefox with foxyProxy enabled
[17:29] <auronandace> terabit: this is a support channel
[17:29] <bekks> terabit: Stop the leetspeak.
[17:30] <Wiz_KeeD> both are enabled

[17:59] <bazhang> !notunity | konradUsb
[17:59] <ubottu> konradUsb: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[18:01] <M0rsa> That's interesting. Have you tried it?
[18:01] <M0rsa> I don't understand why it wouldn't
[18:01] <bazhang> konradUsb, thats purely opinion. decide for yourself
[18:01] <M0rsa> I could assign and IP to the bridge.
[18:02] <konradUsb> bazhang: you should try to help instead of just telling me to upgrade
[18:02] <M0rsa> Sorry... I could assign and IP to the bridge
[18:02] <konradUsb> because it should work

[18:21] <kslater> short of fstab, isn't there a way to control where a disk device gets mounted?
[18:23] <sheepherd> hi all, i got a question. ive been moving files from my laptop (ubuntu 12.10 64bit) to my external hd. everything fine and good, tried to umount, got asked if i want to clean .Trash and i said yes. now my machine has been working for more than 30 mins to clean a folder thats like 200MB in size. i checked with #fuser what process is blocking my external hd and its nautilus -n, after consulting man it seems that the dialog/window is hidd
[18:23] <sheepherd> en but i couldnt find a way to unhide it. does anybody know a way?
[18:23] <markmm> Is it possible to save position of my windows, and reinstate them when I login again? (Unity 12.10)
[18:24] <Wizek> markmm: only your nautlius windows, or all your apps?
[18:25] <markmm> Wizek: Chromium, and a few terms
[18:26] <Wizek> I'd be also interested to know about terms

[18:26] <Wizek> Though, I use terminator

[18:27] <john_sc> hello, what directory other than /etc does ubuntu keep its configuration?
[18:27] <markmm> john_sc: ~
[18:27] <john_sc> home?
[18:28] <Wizek> that is $HOME
[18:28] <markmm> Yes for per user setting
[18:28] <Wizek> is /etc short for something?
[18:28] <john_sc> so no other files anywhere than /etc (yes i know the home defines the shell) stores the configs?
[18:29] <john_sc> im talking about for services and root stuff
[18:29] <atlef> argh
[18:29] <john_sc> including kernel which everything for kernel should be in /boot mount
[18:29] <markmm> Is it a particilar setting you are looking for?
[18:29] <john_sc> right?
[18:29] <llutz> Wizek: "etcetera" historical
[18:29] <atlef> maybe some in /usr

[18:30] <john_sc> no im trying to define mount points and for multiple ubuntu installs (redundancy) save space by having on the config vary between installs, keep the same mount to use for all ubuntu's concerning binaries and such

[18:31] <john_sc> what size would you make /etc? 2 or 3 gb per install?
[18:32] <john_sc> i assume /var needs to be on the fastest SSD/RAID arrays
[18:32] <markmm> john_sc: Nah its tiny just text files
[18:32] <kunji> My /etc/ is < 10 MB
[18:33] <john_sc> so the only thing that varies between ubuntu installs (other than the differences in packages installed) is /var and /etc directories?
[18:33] <markmm> du -hs /etc/ > 13M
[18:33] <john_sc> lol
[18:33] <john_sc> 1 Gig it is
[18:33] <Wizek> my /etc is 56.2 MB
[18:33] <john_sc> ok 500 mb it is :)

[18:34] <kunji> Well, that doesn't need to be the only differences, but it could be if you want do your setup that way.  Wizek, my install is pretty fresh.

[20:03] <mariorgrossi> do not have it installed here.

[20:04] <maequise> I think that the old installations still, but to find the packages now ..
[20:04] <ozzloy> mariorgrossi, in a terminal, type sudo apt-get install -y libreoffice

[20:04] <maequise> So auronandace OpenOffice still alive and continues to be developped ?
[20:05] <ozzloy> mariorgrossi, but it should be installed by default.  what version of ubuntu do you have?  what does cat /etc/issue say?

[20:08] <mariorgrossi> now installing LibreOffice
[20:08] <ozzloy> Vivekananda, in general, i think every time you save anything in ubuntu, you save it as "All Files"
[20:08] <mariorgrossi> thanks

[20:09] <Vivekananda> It is a blank file with the name .nomedia and I am trying to save it in a folder in my android phone. The recommendation online was to create the file in windows andd save as "all files". I just wanted to knnow how to do this in ubuntu
[20:09] <ozzloy> mariorgrossi, i'm not familiar with xubuntu.  it might pull in all of standard ubuntu as a dependency, which i'm guessing you don't want
[20:09] <maequise> gonna game ^^
[20:09] <maequise> See you ;)
[20:10] <ozzloy> Vivekananda, ah, then yeah, you can just save the file
[20:10] <ozzloy> Vivekananda, i believe the online instructions were just trying to avoid microsoft window's automatically adding a file extension to the filename
[20:11] <Vivekananda> ozzloy: without giving it any extensions of course ( like .txt) . ok got it
[20:11] <mariorgrossi> ozzloy I managed to install LibreOffice. Thanks for the trouble
[20:11] <ozzloy> Vivekananda, the default behavior in ubuntu is not adding an extension
[20:11] <ozzloy> mariorgrossi, woo!
[20:11] <Vivekananda> it does  not seem to work for some reason and my phone still reads the files in the folder. I guess this is now for the android forums:)
[20:13] <ozzloy> Vivekananda, what is it you're trying to do?
[20:13] <ozzloy> Vivekananda, keep the android device from reading a folder on your computer?  (this is just out of curiosity, i don't think i have a solution or anything)

[20:17] <auronandace> !runlevel | null1024
[20:17] <ubottu> null1024: In Ubuntu all runlevels except 0,1 and 6 are by default equal. Also keep in mind that Ubuntu now uses !Upstart instead of System V init so there is normally no /etc/inittab.

[21:07] <machicola> ok, great that seems to work. daftykins, can it be done with pipes as well
[21:07] <Rafase282> well I have six core admmachine with 16 gb of ram and 16 of swap memory so I know it cant be memory

[21:07] <daftykins> machicola: as in have pipes in the command?
[21:08] <machicola> i mean, without actually using '>' or '<'
[21:08] <bekks> jdcn: Google drive gives 5GB, and 25GB more for 2,49$
[21:08] <machicola> I guess I figured that pipes could do it all, which seems to not be the case
[21:08] <melodie_> Rafase282, then look at the log from configure or any compile log available

[22:19] <zastern> Anybody have any thoughts about this - http://askubuntu.com/questions/236748/service-tab-completion-broken-as-root-not-even-sure-where-to-start-looking - tab completion for service names when using the service command works fine as a regular user, but doesn't work as root.
[22:21] <hexbyte> Ubiquity4321: try Ctrl+Shift+c for Copy and Ctrl+Shift+v for paste.

[22:52] <MonkeyDust> Anteli  first win, then lin, for windows ruins the grub and you'll have to repair it

[23:15] <Silur> Hello
[23:15] <Jordan_U> stercor_: It looks like you never installed Ubuntu. Boot from a LiveCD/USB containing the Ubuntu installer and install Ubuntu to the internal drive.
[23:16] <bowman> Hi all
[23:16] <Silur> Q: I own VPS and want to setup proxy(or socks?) server on it - for the single purpose to access TV channels that otherwise won't work due to me location. What the best way/software/tutorial to make it happen?
[23:16] <stercor_> I have /home/ubuntu and the GUI works.
[23:17] <MonkeyDust> Billy88  type /join #ubuntu-phone
[23:17] <bowman> I've done a Hardy -> Lucid upgrade on a virtual server, roughly speaking /boot is now empty and the box doesn't boot - known issue? Google isn't too helpful because search results usually suggest using live CDs in order to fix that :-)
[23:17] <Jordan_U> stercor_: That's because you're booted into a LiveUSB, that's not an actual Ubuntu installation. It looks like you dd'd the Ubuntu iso to your internal drive, that's not how you install Ubuntu.
[23:17] <Billy88> I did
[23:17] <cornfeed> Silur: this is not the best place to ask that. and is very application specific
[23:17] <k1l> MonkeyDust: he is already in that channel.
[23:17] <stercor_> Oh..I did what you said: bot from the LiveCD/USB Ubuntu but didn't install Ubuntu to the internal drive
[23:18] <Silur> cornfeed, whats the next best place to ask?
[23:18] <stercor_> Jordan_U: It's not going to format /dev/sda, is it?
[23:18] <cornfeed> Silur: probably efnet....not sure.

[23:19] <MonkeyDust> gavin__  start with a question
[23:19] <Jordan_U> stercor_: I hate to break this to you, but it looks like you lost all the data on sda when you accidentily dd'd the Ubuntu iso to it. You may be able to recover some of it, but not all and not easily.
[23:19] <gavin__> how do you fix the ubuntu 12.10
[23:19] <gavin__> it keeps crashing
[23:19] <zvacet> !ask | gavin_
[23:19] <ubottu> gavin_: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[23:20] <MonkeyDust> gavin__  what went wrong?
[23:20] <k1l> gavin__: reduce the use of enter please :)
[23:20] <stercor_> Jordan_U: I dd'd the iso on this netbook.
[23:20] <stercor_> to /dev/sdb
[23:20] <gavin__> i installed ubuntu 12.10 but whenever i try to use it, it just keeps crashing
[23:20] <gavin__> how do i prevent it from happening?
[23:20] <MonkeyDust> gavin__  thz apparmor messages?
[23:21] <Salastil> That's a broad definition of a problem
[23:21] <Salastil> how does it crash
[23:22] <stercor_> Jordan_U: then booted from the USB drive on the big machine, timesoak.
[23:22] <zvacet> gavin__: does it crach when you start any app does it freeze or what
[23:22] <Salastil> Anyone know if there is a way to make Unity WebApp "programs" not have an icon in the taskbar?
[23:22] <gavin__> Salastil: whenever i hover my mouse over the firefox browser, the whole task bar goes all white with lines on it and then after that, the computer freezes with a black screen and finally i have to force it to shutdown
[23:23] <stercor_> Jordan_U: How about umounting /cow on / and mounting /dev/sda?
[23:23] <Salastil> Is it just The Firefox browser or any icon?
[23:23] <gavin__> when I hover over the entire task bar, it does the same thing to other icons as well
[23:24] <gyre008> I thought getting the process' CPU stats is as easy as reading /proc/<pid>/stat but apparently not...those values NEVER change
[23:24] <stercor_> Jordan_U: umounting a mounted drive is bad news...unless you know how to do it.
[23:24] <micseydel> hello, does ubuntu 12.10 lts have an alternate install disk?
[23:24] <zvacet> gavin__: in terminal type unity & press enter key that should reset unity
[23:24] <micseydel> i'm unable to find one, so i doubt it exists, but my friends really wants it
[23:24] <gavin__> I don't know where the terminal is
[23:24] <Salastil> hit uh windows key
[23:24] <Salastil> if you have one on your keyboard
[23:24] <Salastil> then type in Terminal
[23:25] <Salastil> then hit enter
[23:25] <gavin__> i have just typed unity into terminal
[23:25] <zvacet> micseydel: there is no alternate cd for 12.10 shame but truth
[23:25] <Salastil> is this a clean install gavin__  or have you changed any settings?
[23:25] <HeLLy> Is there a email support I could mail to ubuntu to get them to add Bolivia to mobile broadband
[23:26] <gavin__> it is a full clean install
[23:26] <gavin__> it is telling me that unity is not supported by my hardware
[23:26] <cornfeed> HeLLy: it will be in the works. best ask in #ubuntu-phone
[23:26] <gavin__> it has also given me a lot of error messages
[23:26] <Salastil> What is your video card?
[23:27] <gavin__> why is the video card important?
[23:27] <gavin__> and how is it related?
[23:27] <HeLLy> cornfeed: thank you
[23:27] <Salastil> what are your entire system specs
[23:27] <zvacet> gavin__: then logout and at login screen  select some other option istead of unity
[23:27] <k1l> HeLLy: can you rephrase? im not sure i understand you
[23:27] <mesquka1> Different cards have different capabilities

I found the package "fnfxd" but does anyone know if fnfxd conflicts with acpid? I know some of the functions overlap, and I dont know how to get fnfxd to be the dominant hot key daemon
[23:28] <gavin__> how do i do that?
[23:28] <dormito>  I am trying to get my radeon 5770 working (Im using a build I did of the 3.8rc1 kernel) and so I've been reinstalling/uninstalling fglrx builds.

(Im using ubuntu 12.10 and I am not logging in as root)
[23:28] <Salastil> is it a packpage computer gavin__  like  a Dell or Gateway?
[23:28] <gavin__> not a package computer
[23:28] <cornfeed> gavin__: because you need the proper drivers
[23:29] <gavin__> where can i find the proper drivers
[23:29] <Salastil> it may be something as simple as drivers
[23:29] <Salastil> we need to know what kind of card you have to do some terminal entries
[23:29] <cornfeed> dormito: auditd will help you narrow down what is changing the file
[23:29] <micseydel> zvacet: thank you
[23:29] <Salastil> is it a Nvidia or ATI/AMD card?
[23:30] <k1l> HeLLy: so you use a 3g internet stick?
[23:30] <cornfeed> gavin__: you can run "lspci -v" to find out what pci components you have (which will include your card)
[23:30] <HeLLy> kll: yes
[23:30] <Salastil> in terminal mind you
[23:30] <MonkeyDust> gavin__  in a terminal, type lshw -C Video|grep vendor

[23:31] <zvacet> micseydel: yw  :)
[23:31] <k1l> HeLLy: ok. the login dial number depends on the provider you are on
[23:31] <cornfeed> gavin__: also you can check the main menu for the tool "Additional Drivers" which will help you install proprietary, well supported drivers  (if you dont care about stict foss use)
[23:31] <zvacet> gavin__: post output here

[23:33] <Jordan_U> stercor_: Unmounting is not "bad news". The problem is that you overwrote the first ~GiB of your internal drive, including the partition table and probably a good chunk of the beginning of your root filesyesm,  with the contents of an Ubuntu installation iso.

[23:34] <mesquka1> 12.10
[23:35] <bekks> stercor: Depends on how often you want to update.
[23:35] <stercor> Oh, updates are no problem.
[23:35] <zvacet> stercor: depends what do you want latest stuff or stable system
[23:35] <RU-XerYuS> check
[23:35] <mesquka1> stercor: 12.10 if you don't mind updates

[23:37] <stercor> I've never had problems with updates/upgrades, so I'm tempted to go with 12.11
[23:37] <mesquka1> 12.11 is still testing
[23:37] <HeLLy> k1l: This card was bought in bolivia by there family and used in bolivia by them

[23:39] <mesquka1> there is a 12.11, but is an evaluation build: https://launchpad.net/linaro-ubuntu/+milestone/12.11
[23:39] <k1l> HeLLy: ok. i just want to make sure that the hardware and provider are not an issue
[23:39] <stercor> I meant 12.10
[23:39] <HeLLy> k1l: When I click network connections it displays Entel HSPA and its faded I have 3 bars but I am just not sure if the info that I collected online is that accurate

[23:42] <coolstar> how do I set the default shell for when I SSH in?
[23:42] <Barnabas> coolstar, passwd can do that
[23:42] <coolstar> Barnabas: what's the command?
[23:43] <coolstar> also, this is on a VPS running Ubuntu 11.10 server
[23:43] <dormito> Additionally I want to get my radeon 5770 to display 1960x1080 on my primary monitor and 1440x900 on my secondary. however what I believe is the open radeon driver only lets me go up to 1280X1024 on a single display. is this expected behavior (and thus is the fglrx driver the one I'll need, as before Im using ubuntu 12.10 amd64)?
[23:44] <adamk> dormito: The radeon driver has no 1280x1024 limitation.  I'm using it on two monitors, 1680x1050 and 1600x900.
[23:44] <adamk> It's possible the radeon driver can't read the EDID for the monitors, perhaps...
[23:45] <dormito> adamk: thanks, then in all likelyhood there's something I've setup wrong somewhere
[23:46] <adamk> dormito: Certainly possible :-)  If you pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file, I can see if anything jumps out at me.
[23:46] <taofd> how do i mount with read/write access? i thought setting uid,gid=1000 was enough...
[23:48] <dormito> adamk: ok I'll do that in a bit.. I just start another fglrx install
[23:48] <Barnabas> coolstar, seems that feature is not on ubuntu. you can use the vipw command and change the path to the shell for the user in question
[23:48] <Barnabas> or usermod -D -s /path/to/shell perhaps
[23:48] <coolstar> Barnabas: nvm, I found it
[23:48] <Eliz> hi
[23:48] <coolstar> Barnabas: sudo chsh -s /bin/bash <username>

[23:49] <Eliz> mesquka1: yes
[23:49] <guest666> I have a strange problem. my computer repeatedly reverts to a blank black screen, usually after sleeping. This forces me to cut the power, after which during the reboot, then get stuck on a screen like it's waiting for you to type (not sure what thats called...prompt?) that you can't type in. At this stage all I can do is hit the power button, which strangely shuts the computer off immediately, with no delay whatsoever. The only so
[23:50] <Eliz> grub rescue promt?

[23:51] <sw> Hi, if I wanted to run Ubuntu within VMware Fusion 5 on a Mac, is there a specific image that I should use?
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest86699
[23:51] <mesquka1> sw: no, but try using a 32-bit version, they run better in VMware
[23:52] <mesquka1> guest666: does it happen to be the grub rescue prompt?
[23:52] <sw> mesquka1: I see, I've tried a couple but they were all borked one way or another, so I deleted them and thought that I'd ask here. I tried the server version first as that's what I wanted, but that didn't even want to complete the install, complained about the kernel or something.
[23:52] <mesquka1> sw: ahh, what architechture?
[23:52] <bugtraq_> tu sabe hack meskul
[23:52] <sw> mesquka1: iirc, 'Can't locate kernel 'linux-generic'' or something like that.
[23:53] <sw> mesquka1: I'm on a 64 bit Mac.
[23:53] <guest666> what exactly does that entail? grub is the purple screen with the list of OS's to run, right?
[23:53] <mesquka1> sw: vmware?
[23:53] <guest666> real dummy over here
[23:53] <sw> mesquka1: Yes.
[23:53] <mesquka1> guest666: yes, but when it can't find anything to boot, it goes into a prompt
[23:54] <trendynick> I installed yesterday Ubuntu LTS and updated. I used the computer today and went S3. Now I can't see some opened apps, quassell is accesible with the top bar mail/chat function but chromium?
[23:54] <guest666> hmm, sometimes it does goes to prompt after I select my regular version
[23:54] <sw> mesquka1: Any idea?
[23:54] <mesquka1> guest666: yes, did you try to do anything with the partitions at all?
[23:55] <mesquka1> guest666: before this happened
[23:55] <trendynick> they don't have the triangle/arrow in sidebar, I don't see any bring to front function in the process monitor
[23:55] <guest666> changing or moving anything? nope. not since I deleted my old windows partition and started fresh for this install
[23:56] <mesquka1> sw: I'm looking at it
[23:57] <mesquka1> sw: hold on for a sec, I'll finish with guest666
[23:57] <mesquka1> guest666: your ubuntu installation, was it on an external hard disk?
[23:57] <guest666> no, internal in a laptop
[23:58] <sw> mesquka1: What I was trying to do is run an Ubuntu server under VMware Fusion 5 on a Mac, to put an Openfire server in a contained environment. I started with the server, but that failed during install complaining about the kernel, so I tried regular version after that, and I was having weird things happening during that.
[23:58] <sw> mesquka1: Thanks.
[23:59] <mesquka1> guest666: grub can't find anything to boot from, you will prbably have to reinstall, sorry I can't help you
[23:59] <mesquka1> sw: what version of ubuntu server?
