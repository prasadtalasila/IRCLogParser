[02:11] <John1980> Hello guys, I have a problem with setting up the dual monitors. I googled a lot, and apparently I have some nonstandard problem. My second monitor (connected to onboard vga) has 'green' on its status LED, but is black. When I go to 'Display' configuration and mark 'use this display', my xfce logs out, and then I cannot log in, unless I turn of this monitor in displays.xml
[02:19] <kgb> John1980: on nvidia? what version of xubu?
[02:23] <kgb> ..if one's on your mobo and the other on the video adapter, then there's nothing standard about that btw
[02:23] <John1980> xubuntu 12.10, onboad vga is on intel
[02:24] <kgb> so it's on die? how about the other monitor?
[02:24] <John1980> main monitor is connected to gigabyte external card and works fine
[02:24] <kgb> gigabyte nvidia or ati?
[02:25] <John1980> gigabyte radeon
[02:25] <kgb> i'm asking because there's a *slim* chance that nvidia-settings could do it for you
[02:25] <kgb> ah, it's gonna be stress to set that up, i think the kernel itself must load both videos or something like that
[02:26] <kgb> if it's even possible, idk. :)
[02:26] <John1980> for example when I installed debian 6.0.6, the secondary monitor was totally dead
[02:26] <kgb> radeon=ati, so forget what i said about nvidia =)
[02:27] <John1980> then its status led was purple
[02:27] <John1980> on xubuntu, it's green, and xrandr sees it
[02:28] <kgb> i remember playing with it here and maybe xubu does load them both on boot by default, but i really forget how it goes
[02:28] <kgb> :s
[02:31] <John1980> ok no problem. I am running out of ideas, that's why I'm here.
[02:31] <John1980> all the problems with dual displays are about something else, no one has problems with this one checkbox
[02:32] <ruien> I'm not experienced with dual monitors myself, but my guess is that you'll have better luck running two monitors from a single video card. At least, that seems to be the most-tested configuration.
[02:33] <John1980> Probably this would be best, but for now there is connector incompatibility
[02:33] <kgb> heh
[02:35] <John1980> the vga one is only vga, I'd like to use it for terminal
[02:35] <John1980> video card does not have vga :)
[02:37] <kgb> besides, i wouldn't mind sticking a 3rd monitor on the mobo either
[02:40] <John1980> :)
[02:48] <vitimiti> o/
[03:45] <hero616> Does <primary> key has another name? I can't find it.

[03:49] <hero616> Oh it's work, thank you.

[08:28] <xubuntu655> Just intalled Xubun 12.10. Bun sound doesn't work properly: all channels work nice except center frontal.
[08:28] <xubuntu655> *xubuntu
[08:28] <xubuntu655> *but
[08:29] <ochosi> what's the problem with it, i mean how does it not "work nicely"?
[08:29] <ochosi> also: what kind of hardware do you have
[08:33] <xubuntu655> Soundcard Intel 82801DB. RAM 512 mb. Processor Intel Pentium 4-2800 (533MHz)
[08:35] <xubuntu655> it doesn't work at all
[08:35] <ochosi> what kind of setup do you have? 5.1?
[08:36] <xubuntu655> yes
[08:36] <ochosi> did the soundcard work with any other versions of ubuntu/xubuntu/linux?
[08:38] <ochosi> also: did you check via alsamixer (in terminal) whether the front-channel is unmuted?
[08:38] <xubuntu655> I have intalled lubuntu. Only two frontal speakers worked
[08:45] <xubuntu655> I switched on center but now back right speaker doesn't work
[08:48] <ochosi> so in lubuntu only front worked, and in xubuntu everything _but_ front works?
[08:54] <xubuntu655> I think channels are mixed up. Because when I am turning on center front channel rear left channel increases

[13:39] <stratoka> hello all, i have a question. Im running Debian testing atm, and i want to switch to xubuntu for personal reasons. The Question is, should i go winth 12.04 LTS or the 12.10? Are there significant differences?
[13:39] <knome> 12.04 has longer support, 12.10 has newer software versions
[13:40] <Pici> where support means security updates and community support here.
[13:40] <knome> see http://xubuntu.org/news/12-10-release/ for the release notes for 12.10
[13:41] <stratoka> i see, performace wise for a desktop computer would you reccomend the LTS?
[13:41] <knome> only performance-wise, no, i don't see the benefits
[13:43] <stratoka> it is for everyday use, nothing more, maybe a little video editing but thats all.
[13:43] <stratoka> only notable change is the Xfce 4.10?
[13:44] <knome> if you don't consider complete documentation rewrite a notable change
[13:44] <stratoka> ok, thank you for the guidelines
[13:44] <stratoka> see you guys!

=== brospin is now known as Catbuntu
[18:43] <David-A> qasim: have you tried install proprietary drivers with System>Auxiliary Drivers or System>Hardware Drivers? or tried without? what graphics card/chip?
[18:46] <qasim> i tried what they call third party codecs or drivers...then i installed nvidea driver still nothing happened
[18:47] <qasim> i can watch normal movies / videos ....only prob comes when i try playing blue ray of HD 1080p movies or videos
[18:48] <GridCube> not to push you away from xubuntu, but maybe you could try geexbox?
[18:49] <GridCube> you just need a booteable usb
[18:50] <qasim> my old lappy doesnot support bootable usb :(
[18:51] <GridCube> well, use a cd
[18:55] <David-A> qasim: i'v had old fan-less nvidia that got overheated with playing hi res videos. can you check that is not the case here?
[18:56] <qasim> you mean some hardware problem?
[18:57] <qasim> okay... but why my m player crashes even when i try playimh audio songs David-A ?
[18:58] <qasim> GridCube, i just dont wana shift to anyother linux os so early :(
[18:58] <qasim> when i try playing*
[18:59] <GridCube> its just a livecd OS, you dont "need" to install it, if that doestn work then the problem is not with xubuntu
[19:00] <ikra> hi all, i have a problem with suspend: with kernel 3.2.0.32 it works well, but after upgraded to 3.2.0.35 it doesn't, if install newer kernel the problem still, but if i use 3.2.0.32 it works again. So i think it's a "kernel" configuration problem, what test could i make what data do you need to help me understand this problem? thanks!
[19:00] <David-A> qasim: right, than that shouldnt happen

[21:00] <knome> vitimiti, yes?
[21:01] <vitimiti> i don't know

[21:06] <Unit193> Noskcaj: Shimmer themes are the best, but there were some others that were pretty compatible.  The Zukitwo theme was compatible a while ago, may still be.
[21:07] <Noskcaj> Unit193, ok, i will mess around with a few. my lubuntu install fai;ed because i changed too many config files, so back to xubuntu
[21:08] <Noskcaj> also, how do i get Ctrl+Alt+T to work in xubuntu
[21:09] <Ronalds_M> just installed xubuntu on my old Athlon
[21:09] <Ronalds_M> I have 4 ports for audio out
[21:09] <Ronalds_M> main port is broken
[21:10] <Unit193> Noskcaj: Add it to the keyboard shortcuts.  Settings Manager > Keyboard.
[21:10] <Ronalds_M> so I have to use 5.1 for sound
[21:10] <Noskcaj> Unit193, thanks.
[21:10] <Ronalds_M> but sound has delays
[21:10] <Ronalds_M> anybody knows how to fix sound lags?
[21:10] <Noskcaj> one last question, how can i remove the text blurring that occurs when the blackbird theme is active
[21:10] <xubuntu895> the DVD won't boot
[21:10] <xubuntu895> How do i fix it?
[21:11] <Ronalds_M> RW DVD?
[21:11] <xubuntu895> YES
[21:11] <Ronalds_M> maybe thats why
[21:11] <xubuntu895> but I finalized it
[21:11] <Ronalds_M> xubuntu has DVD?
[21:11] <xubuntu895> I don't understand the quesstion
[21:12] <Ronalds_M> you used DVD for 750 mb
[21:12] <xubuntu895> YES
[21:12] <Ronalds_M> ok
[21:12] <Ronalds_M> don't know why, probably disk ir broken
[21:12] <Ronalds_M> or RW means something bad
[21:12] <xubuntu895> I burned already 3 dvds
[21:13] <Ronalds_M> RW?
[21:13] <xubuntu895> RW is re-write
[21:13] <Ronalds_M> all of them?
[21:13] <xubuntu895> yes
[21:13] <Ronalds_M> yes, that's probably why it doesn't boots
[21:13] <xubuntu895> Should I try on regulare dvd?
[21:13] <Ronalds_M> try DVD R
[21:13] <xubuntu895> OK 10X
[21:14] <xubuntu895> sorry I checked again
[21:14] <xubuntu895> they are DVD-R
[21:14] <Ronalds_M> anybody knows how to use different port for audio out so sound wouldn't have delays and lags?
[21:14] <Ronalds_M> fail
[21:14] <Ronalds_M> :D
[21:14] <Ronalds_M> maybe ISO is corrupted
[21:15] <xubuntu895> I downloaded it now from the web
[21:15] <Ronalds_M> I just installed Xubuntu
[21:15] <Ronalds_M> 12.04
[21:15] <Ronalds_M> with CD R
[21:15] <Ronalds_M> also from the web
[21:15] <xubuntu895> I downloaded 12.10
[21:15] <xubuntu895> did you try it?
[21:16] <Ronalds_M> no, no need
[21:17] <xubuntu895> why?
[21:18] <Ronalds_M> well I don't know, try LTS
[21:18] <Ronalds_M> it's a stable version
[21:18] <xubuntu895> meaning 12.04?
[21:18] <Ronalds_M> yes
[21:19] <xubuntu895> What are the ifferences between desktop and alternate in the download page?
[21:24] <Ronalds_M> 5.1 output has delays for sound
[21:24] <Ronalds_M> how to fix that
[21:24] <Ronalds_M> anybody?
