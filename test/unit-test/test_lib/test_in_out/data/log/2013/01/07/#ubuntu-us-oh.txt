[04:25] <BiosElement> How's it going folks? ^_^ Well, for those of you who are alive late.
[04:26] <yano> good
[04:26] <yano> i survived the apocalypse
[04:26] <BiosElement> Small miracle that ;P
[04:27] <BiosElement> I'm pretty sure I died and went to hell. Or at least I gather that since I'm actually enjoying Unity currently. :/
[04:28] <Unit193> BiosElement: Howdy.
[04:28] <Unit193> yano: How are the Zombies?
[04:28] <BiosElement> Hey Unit193, It's been a while.
[04:29] <Unit193> BiosElement: You sure it's been long enough? ;)
[04:29] <Unit193> I still like Xfce, and the others.
[04:29] <BiosElement> No, I'm pretty sure it hasn't.
[04:29] <yano> Unit193: dead
[04:30] <yano> I use AwesomeWM
[04:32] <BiosElement> I presume I didn't miss much?
[04:32] <yano> miss much of?
[04:33] <BiosElement> Generally. I haven't been on IRC for months. >.>
[04:33] <Unit193> Had a meeting, of sorts.
[04:33] <BiosElement> I saw that, anything of note?
[04:34] <Unit193> I'm being the same old idiot self. :D  Minutes were posted, big thing was that we're no approved for now.
[04:35] <BiosElement> Not that that makes much of a difference anymore. :/
[04:35] <Unit193> Some swag for OLF and if there is a Ubucon, but we should be approved again by then, so they say.
[04:36] <BiosElement> I wouldn't hold my breath. Hopefully things get sorted out though.
[05:27] <skellat> Are you up and around jacob?
[05:27] <skellat> The team site is throwing a new error at me on upload of "An HTTP error 0 occurred. /upload/js"
[05:34] <skellat> jacob: This looks moderately relevant and I'll just try to upload again after some sleep -- http://drupal.org/node/240777
[05:34]  * skellat looks at the cat, worried that Shadow is ready to attack the cat
[05:40] <Unit193> BiosElement: You need your core back, so you can ignore IRC so much better! :D
[05:59] <BiosElement> Unit193, I may well have to do so yes ^_^
[06:23] <Unit193> BiosElement: I'd guess you still do MC, and didn't like Minetest at the time.  Anything change?
[06:42] <BiosElement> Yes and Not really sadly.
