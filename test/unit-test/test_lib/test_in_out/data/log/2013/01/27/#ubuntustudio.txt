[02:05] <zequence> xrs: Depends on the type of questions you have. Since Ubuntu Studio is mainly about multimedia, we are better at answering questions about that. On desktop stuff, it's either Xubuntu/XFCE related, or even Ubuntu related, all though we try to answer any question we get
[02:07] <xrs> i was specifically told Ubuntu Studio is NOT a supported fork and i am NOT to seek help in #xubuntu or #ubuntu
[02:08] <zequence> xrs: What were you asking about?
[02:09] <zequence> Ubuntu Studio is an official flavor of Ubuntu, and the desktop is mostly imported from Xubuntu.
[02:09] <Unit193> It's a targeted flavor of Ubuntu/Xubuntu, if you are seeking operating system help, would be nice to say you use UbuntuStudio, and if you are seeking audio help, #opensourcemusicians
[02:10] <xrs> i was helping other people in #ubuntu. some one asked if they could get support for Ubuntu Studio in there and i said yes, also told him if #ubuntustudio is totally dead he can try #xubuntu and thats when i got ran out of there
[02:11] <Unit193> Note, not all applications are the same, Xubuntu doesn't use nautilus so #ubuntu would be better there.  I'm taking a look at the logs for more info about that run in.
[02:12] <xrs> also noticed a few config files are in different spots n slightly different than in Xubuntu
[02:13] <zequence> There are differences of course. It all depends on the question
[04:46] <holstein> xrs: you can send folk to #opensourcemusicians too.. for audio specific stuff

[09:02] <west_> how do I get instrument files on hear to play diff instruments using keyboard or external instrument. Im a noob.
[09:03] <west_> can I make some dub step sounds.
[10:09] <famax8> west_: dude is quiet vague what you are asking, try to be more specific if you need help for the guys, such as which application you use etc, otherwise i would recommend you to first read the main tutorials and then come back here for deeper or more specific help
[10:14] <famax8> west_: meanwhile you can always record via your mic your sounds from a bass and so on on ardour and then rework them ioporting them in otehr programs
[11:35] <west_> ok thanks for the heads up. will do tutorials. thanks.
[14:39] <behnoud> hi got a question anyone?
=== a is now known as Guest41010
[14:42] <Guest41010> i have a problem with sh-201 with ubuntu studio
[14:42] <Guest41010> any idea?
[14:58] <zequence> Guest41010: sh-201?
[14:58] <Guest41010> Roland Sh-201 sound card
[15:10] <zequence> Guest41010: What kind of problem are you having? Is it a usb device?
[15:16] <Guest41010> see im not sure but im noob on ubuntu
[15:17] <Guest41010> i should patch this on my ubuntu
[15:17] <Guest41010> http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=sound/usb/usbquirks.h;h=9274baf699015bba026015feca8e27432d198d20;hb=87823090a8bd373f34bdb6f1d5cdc5f2f4da4905
[15:17] <Guest41010> i guess...
[15:17] <Guest41010> but how i dont know? :S
[15:19] <Guest41010> <zequence>
[15:27] <zequence> Guest41010: That's already included in the kernel source, since that is 2.6
[15:29] <zequence> Guest41010: Could you use the terminal for a bit, please? And paste the output on paste.ubuntu.com
[15:29] <zequence> Guest41010: cat /proc/asound/cards
[15:29] <zequence> Make sure your audio device is connected
[15:46] <Guest41010> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1576998/
[15:47] <Guest41010> actually sometimes plays but sometimes not
[15:49] <zequence> Guest41010: Ok, so your device is recognized. To get desktop audio working, you need to use the pulse audio mixer. You can find from the volume applet at the top bar, or this in a terminal: pavucontrol
[15:50] <Guest41010> its open
[15:50] <Guest41010> Output Dummy Output
[15:50] <Guest41010> but sometimes its SH-201
[15:51] <Guest41010> and Input: No input devices available
[15:52] <zequence> Guest41010: Under the "Output Devices" tab, have you set your device "Set as Fallback"? The green icon
[15:53] <Guest41010> for which one?
[15:53] <Guest41010> for both sometimes
[15:53] <zequence> Guest41010: You can only set it for one device
[15:54] <Guest41010> but sometimes like now only Dummy Output is
[15:54] <zequence> Make sure you select it for your usb device. It should be the second one
[15:54] <Guest41010> actually theres no hardware output device
[15:54] <Guest41010> it happens when i restart my device
[15:55] <Guest41010> or sometimes when it crash
[15:55] <zequence> Guest41010: Do you have any wav files on your computer?
[15:55] <Guest41010> sure
[15:55] <Guest41010> it doesnt play
[15:57] <Guest41010> should i restart the OS?
[15:57] <zequence> Guest41010: Restarting won't help
[15:57] <zequence> Guest41010: Maybe you could paste the pic of the output section?
[15:58] <zequence> Use Screenshot to grab a pic
[15:58] <zequence> Should be somehwere in the menu
[15:58] <Guest41010> in progress

[16:01] <Guest41010> http://imagepaste.nullnetwork.net/viewimage.php?id=5597
[16:03] <zequence> Guest41010: Ah, that didn't look normal at all. Let's restart pulseaudio: pulseaudio -k
[16:03] <zequence> Will kill it, but it respawns
[16:04] <zequence> Then reopen pavucontrol and check if you see your devices there
[16:04] <Guest41010> done
[16:04] <Guest41010> still nothing happened
[16:05] <zequence> Guest41010: Well, it seems like pulseaudio is having problems with your setup, however, alsa recognizes your cards
[16:05] <zequence> This means jack will work, but you may keep having problems with PA
[16:05] <zequence> Guest41010: To use jack with your audio device, open qjackctl..
[16:06] <Guest41010> JACK is here
[16:06] <Guest41010> started
[16:07] <zequence> Guest41010: Then, in Setup -> Interface, choose hw:1
[16:07] <Guest41010> its not hw:sh-201 by me
[16:08] <zequence> To make sure qjackctl always starts with your usb devices, you can manually write "hw:SH201"
[16:08] <zequence> Without the quotes
[16:08] <Guest41010> done
[16:08] <zequence> If you look in "Connect", you should see pulseaudio sink and source (hopefully)
[16:09] <Guest41010> lots of errors
[16:09] <Guest41010> when i hit the start
[16:09] <zequence> Quitting jack sometimes does not work
[16:09] <zequence> But, if it starts, then it's ok
[16:09] <zequence> Did it start?
[16:09] <zequence> If no, first kill it: killall -9 jackdbus
[16:09] <zequence> Then try again
[16:12] <Guest41010> error again
[16:12] <zequence> Guest41010: It started once, did it now?
[16:12] <Guest41010> its still on starting
[16:13] <Guest41010> overall operation failed
[16:13] <Guest41010> server communication error
[16:13] <zequence> Ok. Let's make pulseaudio sleep for a while, while you start jack.
[16:14] <Guest41010> should i kill?
[16:14] <zequence> Do this in a terminal, then start jack from qjackctl: killall -9 jackdbus && pavuspender -- sleep 15
[16:14] <zequence> PA will sleep for 15 sec
[16:14] <zequence> And you should be able to start jack
[16:14] <zequence> Sorry
[16:15] <zequence> Guest41010: killall -9 jackdbus && pasuspender --sleep 15
[16:15] <zequence> Guest41010: killall -9 jackdbus && pasuspender -- sleep 15
[16:17] <Guest41010> D-Bus: JACK server could not be started
[16:17] <Guest41010> Sorry
[16:18] <zequence> Guest41010: Ok, just to make perfectly sure everything else is dead and killed..
[16:19] <zequence> Guest41010: Close qjackctl
[16:19] <Guest41010> done
[16:19] <zequence> Guest41010: killall -9 jackdbus && killall -9 jackd && pasuspender -- qjackctl

[16:21] <zequence> Warnings don't matter
[16:21] <zequence> Try starting jack now
[16:21] <zequence> If it fails, paste the error for me at paste.ubuntu.com
[16:23] <Guest41010> the sound is up
[16:23] <Guest41010> idk why
[16:23] <Guest41010> now
[16:23] <Guest41010> the jack is stopped
[16:23] <Guest41010> but skype started to ding
[16:23] <zequence> Ok, so qjackctl is not running anymore?
[16:23] <zequence> Cause, that would be strange
[16:24] <Guest41010> its open
[16:24] <Guest41010> lemme a sec
[16:24] <Guest41010> the last log:
[16:24] <Guest41010> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1577171/
[16:24] <Guest41010> from Qjackctl
[16:25] <zequence> Guest41010: It complains about the device not existing
[16:25] <zequence> Guest41010: Big letter "hw:SH201"
[16:25] <zequence> It's case sensitice
[16:25] <zequence> Then it should work
[16:26] <zequence> Again, start qjackctl with: killall -9 jackdbus && killall -9 jackd && pasuspender -- qjackctl
[16:27] <Guest41010> no process found
[16:27] <zequence> That just means there was nothing to kill
[16:28] <zequence> Guest41010: Make sure "Setup -> Interface" says "hw:SH201", not "hw:sh201"
[16:28] <zequence> Then, start jack
[16:28] <Guest41010> it is
[16:28] <Guest41010> with caps
[16:28] <Guest41010> SH-201
[16:28] <zequence> Not SH-201
[16:29] <zequence> SH201
[16:29] <Guest41010> ok
[16:29] <Guest41010> same error
[16:29] <zequence> Ok, set it to hw:1
[16:29] <zequence> And restart qjackctl, again, with this command: killall -9 jackdbus && killall -9 jackd && pasuspender -- qjackctl
[16:30] <Guest41010> question
[16:31] <Guest41010> server prefix: usr/bin/jackd
[16:31] <Guest41010> right?
[16:31] <Guest41010> name: default
[16:31] <Guest41010> driver alsa
[16:31] <zequence> Please, do not make any other changes than what I tell yiou
[16:32] <Guest41010> alright just checking
[16:32] <Guest41010> again no process found
[16:33] <zequence> no process found is not a problem. It only means there was no process to kill
[16:33] <Guest41010> yep
[16:33] <Guest41010> just said done
[16:33] <zequence> does jack start?
[16:34] <Guest41010> nope
[16:34] <zequence> Is your device still connected?
[16:34] <Guest41010> yes
[16:34] <zequence> Try with hw:0
[16:34] <Guest41010> see
[16:34] <zequence> That's your onboard device
[16:35] <Guest41010> i have SH-201 Analog Stereo on Output Devices
[16:35] <zequence> ?
[16:35] <Guest41010> on volume control
[16:35] <Guest41010> i meant
[16:36] <zequence> Ok, so it's working with pulseaudio now. I still want to see if you can start jack, or not
[16:36] <Guest41010> and its on input too
[16:36] <Guest41010> i tried jack before and i adjusted that and worked
[16:36] <Guest41010> but i cant remember what i did
[16:36] <Guest41010> ok lets try hw:0
[16:37] <Guest41010> onboard
[16:37] <Guest41010> same errors (2)
[16:38] <zequence> Give me the output from the log
[16:38] <Guest41010> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1577210/
[16:39] <zequence> Guest41010: Sorry. It seems like there was something weird with my command ( I never tried it myself)
[16:39] <zequence> Guest41010: So, first: killall -9 jackdbus
[16:39] <zequence> Then: pasuspender -- qjackctl
[16:40] <Guest41010> done
[16:40] <zequence> pasuspender makes pulseaudio sleep
[16:40] <zequence> Now it should work
[16:40] <Guest41010> with hw:0?
[16:40] <zequence> With both
[16:40] <Guest41010> rolling
[16:40] <Guest41010> started
[16:40] <Guest41010> cool
[16:41] <zequence> Guest41010: Have you installed jackd2?
[16:41] <Guest41010> nope
[16:41] <zequence> it's the default
[16:41] <zequence> There's also jackd1
[16:41] <Guest41010> i dont know
[16:42] <zequence> jackd -V
[16:42] <Guest41010> where to find the ver?
[16:42] <Guest41010> its 1
[16:42] <zequence> 1.9.9?
[16:42] <Guest41010> ye
[16:42] <zequence> Then it's jackd2
[16:42] <Guest41010> actually 1.9.9
[16:43] <Guest41010> but w8
[16:43] <zequence> Guest41010: btw, I forgot to ask you to make sure no desktop applications were using audio. Like the youtube, or such
[16:43] <Guest41010> nothing
[16:43] <zequence> Seems like you might have some problems grabbing the card from pulseaudio
[16:44] <Guest41010> no task atm
[16:45] <Guest41010> hey
[16:45] <Guest41010> it works with hw:SH201
[16:45] <Guest41010> and doesnt work with hw:1
[16:46] <Guest41010> or hw:SH-201
[16:46] <Guest41010> i did that
[16:46] <Guest41010> :
[16:46] <Guest41010> hw:SH201
[16:46] <Guest41010> killall -9 jackdbus
[16:46] <Guest41010> pasuspender -- qjackctl
[16:46] <Guest41010> started
[16:47] <Guest41010> audacious works fine with a wave
[16:47] <zequence> The trick is to use pasuspender to make PA sleep for a little while
[16:47] <zequence> Then have it wake up again
[16:48] <zequence> You could add a script to qjackctl, in "Setup -> Options -> Start Script at Startup"
[16:49] <Guest41010> execute script on startup
[16:49] <Guest41010> ?
[16:49] <Guest41010> ok what to open?
[16:50] <Guest41010> or writing
[16:50] <zequence> Guest41010: Download this file http://paste.ubuntu.com/1577248/
[16:50] <zequence> Put it where you want
[16:50] <zequence> Add it where I suggested
[16:50] <Guest41010> heading
[16:51] <Guest41010> ok
[16:51] <Guest41010> download text as
[16:51] <zequence> So, next time you start jack, hopefully, you should see PA sink and source appear in "Connect"
[16:52] <zequence> About 5 sec after you start jack, that is
[16:52] <zequence> Then, you can go to the PA mixer, and choose Jack as the output
[16:54] <Guest41010> done
[16:54] <Guest41010> restarting JACK
[16:54] <Guest41010> doesnt work
[16:57] <zequence> Guest41010: yeah, sorry. Seems to not work for me either..
[17:03] <zequence> Guest41010: It seems it was not smart to download the file
[17:03] <zequence> Something is wrong with the file, but the text is correct
[17:04] <zequence> Copy and paste the text instead, and save it to a file
[17:04] <zequence> Guest41010: This worked for me
[17:05] <Guest41010> i did that
[17:05] <Guest41010> gedit > save
[17:05] <Guest41010> but .*?
[17:05] <zequence> Wait..
[17:06] <zequence> Yep, it works
[17:06] <zequence> PA goes to sleep for 5 sec, jack starts, and then PA wakes up
[17:07] <Guest41010> im sure i have problem with saving
[17:07] <zequence> You should select and copy the text. Not download as
[17:07] <Guest41010> i did copy
[17:07] <zequence> There is some problem with the file that is downloaded. You can't see it in a text editor
[17:07] <Guest41010> and its on gedit
[17:08] <zequence> Well, anyway. I'm sure you get the idea
[17:08] <Guest41010> but what is the format to save?
[17:08] <zequence> Oh..
[17:08] <zequence> I forgot one thing
[17:08] <zequence> You just need to make it executable
[17:08] <zequence> In a termina: chmod +x <myfile>
[17:08] <zequence> Or right click, and change permissions
[17:09] <zequence> Ok, I need to get going. Good luck
[17:09] <Guest41010> thanks
[17:09] <Guest41010> you too
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
[22:46] <sirriffsalot> How would I set an environment variable when running Ardour beta 3 in ubuntustudio 12.10?
[22:47] <zequence> sirriffsalot: Which variable do you mean?
[22:47] <zequence> You can add variable to your ~/.bashrc
[22:47] <zequence> export MYVARIABLE=something
[22:48] <zequence> Add a line like that to the bottom
[22:48] <sirriffsalot> Hmm
[22:48] <sirriffsalot> http://ardour.org/node/5281
[22:48] <sirriffsalot> FORCE_BUGGY_GRADIENTS=1
[22:48] <sirriffsalot> I did that with the export suggestion.. but arduor 3 is so laggy it is going to the point of madness
[22:49] <sirriffsalot> Pressing the record button takes 4 seconds.. I have the latest nvidia drivers etc as this is a fresh 12.10 install
[22:49] <sirriffsalot> zequence, thanks for replying so quickly by the way!
[22:50] <zequence> sirriffsalot: add it at the ned of ~/.bashrc
[22:50] <zequence> export FORCE_BUGGY_GRADIENTS=1
[22:51] <zequence> you'll need to logout and login again
[22:51] <zequence> Or, does that only work for shell stuff..
[22:51] <zequence> Anyway, try taht
[22:51] <zequence> Actually, you can try it by just starting ardour from a new shell window
[22:51] <zequence> When you open a new shell window, it reads the .bashrc file
[22:52] <sirriffsalot> zequence, starting ardour from a new terminal, right?
[22:52] <sirriffsalot> zequence, is starting ardour from terminal by going /opt/Ardour/bin/ardour3 right?
[22:53] <zequence> sirriffsalot: that sounds right. i don't have ardour3 installed though
[22:53] <sirriffsalot> Ok, hang on..
[22:55] <zequence> sirriffsalot: It says on the bottom of that forum post that the open drivers were a bit better
[22:55] <zequence> sirriffsalot: The free drivers are getting better all the time. I'd give it a try
[22:56] <sirriffsalot> zequence, nouveau.. what's this?:) Fairly new to linux in comparison to you :)
[22:56] <zequence> sirriffsalot: nouveau is what you have before you add proprietary drivers
[22:56] <zequence> So, just unactivate them
[22:58] <sirriffsalot> zequence, how do I do this in 12.10? can't find the drivers button anymore
[22:59] <zequence> sirriffsalot: It's now in Software Sources
[22:59] <zequence> from the terminal: software-properties-gtk
[22:59] <zequence> last tab
[23:01] <sirriffsalot> Nouveau display driver from xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (open source) ?:P
[23:05] <sirriffsalot> Is a relog/reboot necessary?
[23:13] <sirriffsalot> zequence, tried it both with the open source drivers and the environment variable.. Same frustrating problem
[23:14] <sirriffsalot> zequence, perhaps you can solve another problem instead.. I've got a laptop with RAID on it, and for some reason, no matter how I partition, the bootloader is either uninstallable or is not found when I try to install ubuntu 12.10..
[23:14] <sirriffsalot> zequence, mind telling me exactly how I should partition and place the bootloader and or other partitions?
[23:15] <zequence> sirriffsalot: During installation, make sure to have GRUB be installed onto the right drive
[23:15] <zequence> I don't have any experience with raid, but the boot loader usually goes to the first drive, which normally is /dev/sda
[23:16] <sirriffsalot> Yeah.. that's the problem.
[23:17] <sirriffsalot> For some reason /dev/sda does not exist
[23:17] <sirriffsalot> Only /dev/mapper/isw_dcggdjjfea_XPS.. :-S
[23:19] <zequence> sirriffsalot: Sorry, can't help you there. But, you could make a bug report. Have you had a similar problem while installing, say, regular Ubuntu?
[23:19] <zequence> or just Ubuntu Studio?
[23:20] <sirriffsalot> zequence, no, it's the same problem for both. It really is my fault, because I cannot recall how I fixed this issue one year ago, hehe
[23:22] <sirriffsalot> zequence, I'm seeing no change whatever I do with ardour 3.. and a new session has no problems.. Just huge sessions get laggy.. does that explain things somehow?
[23:27] <zequence> sirriffsalot: This to me sounds like it has to do with Ardour itself
[23:27] <sirriffsalot> Hmm..
[23:28] <sirriffsalot> Well, their solution is the environment thing.. but to no avail for me
[23:29] <sirriffsalot> zequence, do you have any suggestions on how to most efficiently move all the files from A3 to an A2 session?
[23:42] <zequence> sirriffsalot: I'm not an expert in ardour in any way. Since it is a Ardour package you are using, i suggest asking about it on #ardour
[23:43] <zequence> meaning, it's not a Ubuntu Studio build
[23:43] <zequence> I know they can be a bit pedantic about that sort of thing
[23:48] <sirriffsalot> zequence, that description being one of the reasons I turned here, hehe
[23:49] <zequence> sirriffsalot: Well, since you are using their build, any user support questions should be ok for them
[23:50] <zequence> ..which they should be anyway
[23:51] <sirriffsalot> Hehe
[23:55] <sirriffsalot> Would it help to build it from scratch instead of using the pre-build binary?
