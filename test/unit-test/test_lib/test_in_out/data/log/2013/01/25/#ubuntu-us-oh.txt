[00:48] <canthus13> dzho: Probably, but $REALLY_OLD_BUT_FAMOUS_COMPUTER is infinitely more productive.
[00:49] <canthus13> and cable boxes are touchy enough without throwing something at them they don't expect. you'd prolly just brick it.
[00:49] <canthus13> hell. Watching TV can brick a cable box.
[00:50] <dzho> it's not the cable box, it's just a DVR-sans-hard-drive
[00:50] <dzho> ostensibly a blue-ray player, but it has an ethernet jack and a USB port
[00:50] <dzho> blu-ray (tm)
[00:50] <canthus13> ah.
[00:51] <dzho> was something like $40 or $50 on sale at Best Buy over the holidays and so I was sort of "meh, why not"
[00:51]  * canthus13 has seen a Pace box brick simply by turning it off and back on.
[00:51] <dzho> yeah, that sounds like A Problem
[00:51] <canthus13> It's not really Pace's fault.. It's TV Guide. their sofware sucks.
[00:52] <Cheri703> \o/ I like xubuntu!
[00:53] <Cheri703> super customizable panels = happy dual monitors!
[00:53] <Cheri703> also 24" 16:10 monitors are HUGE
[00:54] <canthus13> I have a 22" at work. it's quite large enough.
[00:55] <Cheri703> :D I got two
[00:55] <Cheri703> semi-impulsively, but...yes. migraine brought on by flickery screen = OMG MAKE IT STOP
[00:56] <Cheri703> I'd been eyeing these for a while, just hadn't pulled the trigger
[00:56]  * canthus13 nods.
[05:10] <skellat> Blah: http://erielookingproductions.info/2013/01/119-seeking-the-logline
[14:09] <dzho> Cheri703: you have two 24" monitors?
[15:36] <Cheri703> yep :D
[15:36] <Cheri703> as of yesterday evening
[15:37] <Cheri703> I'll fully admit it's a bit of overkill for day to day personal computer use, BUT for work stuff it's pretty great
[15:44] <paultag> overkill?
[15:44] <paultag> is there such a thing?
[15:56] <Cheri703> pretty sure the setup of one of the contractors for my company would qualify, he's got like 6 monitors of varying sizes up to (iirc) 30" all arrayed in front of him
[16:39] <jrgifford> Cheri703: that's not overkill
[16:39] <jrgifford> i met a guy who had like 10 20" monitors
[16:40] <jrgifford> one was a nagios dashboard
[16:40] <paultag> the most I had was 3 :)
[16:40] <jrgifford> he had his server error.log piped through some funky grep thing that returned serious stuff on one
[16:40] <paultag> Once I get my new place, I'm about to try 2x2, or 1x4, longways
[16:40] <Cheri703> I'm at 3 if I'm also running the laptop on my lapdesk
[16:41] <jrgifford> and had ssh terminals to other machines on all the others.
[16:41] <jrgifford> the guy never saw his desktop.
[16:42] <paultag> ‚Üê never sees his desktop
[18:29] <skellat> This is part of why living in Ashtabula County can get aggravating at times: http://identi.ca/notice/99213560

[19:23] <dzho> http://www.imfromohio.com/post/40765885538/everyone-in-ohio-when-forbes-named-dayton-as-the haha, I missed this forbes thing
[19:23] <paultag> aaaahahaha
[19:26] <Cheri703> yeah, someone linked me to that site a few days ago, saw the link from fyo and saw the mansfield one :)
[19:26] <Cheri703> I know no one here is officially a xubuntu person, but anyone have thoughts on this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1921687 ?
[19:26] <Cheri703> at least, afaik no one is
[19:28] <dzho> also, xubuntu+second monitor+ . . . well, ohio
[19:28] <dzho> ;-)
[19:28] <Cheri703> hrm?
[19:29] <dzho> intersection of sets are smaller than the sets themselves, so . . . good luck with that.
[19:29] <Unit193> Well, I don't use dual monitors, so don't know.
[19:29] <Cheri703> ah, yeah
[19:30] <Cheri703> it treats far edges as edges, even though you can make it so windows are draggable through the far edge
[19:30] <Unit193> skellat uses last I knew, as do I.
[19:30] <dzho> I can't remember if we're running lubuntu or xubuntu on the thinkpad the kid uses at home.
[19:30] <Cheri703> so you'd think *something* could be done to make the "seams" treated as edges
[19:30] <dzho> I'll try to pay attention next time I'm on it.
[19:30] <dzho> laptops + external monitor is a "two monitor" situation I often don't think about as such.
[19:31] <Cheri703> yeah
[19:31] <dzho> mostly because I most commonly encounter that with a projector, which is horrible to use as side-by-side, so we usually punt and mirror.
[19:32] <yano> haha, that site is golden
[19:32] <Cheri703> heh
[19:49] <Cheri703> one: I posted to the forums about this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1921687
[19:49] <Cheri703> bah, wrong window
[19:49] <Cheri703> sorry
[21:53] <Unit193> Cheri703: I decided to try OMG!Ponies just for the heck of it, someone just pinged me and I literally said "Oohh!" and jerked back a bit. :D
[21:53] <Cheri703> hehe, that was my reaction too!
[21:53] <Cheri703> it makes sure you don't miss messages
[21:53] <Cheri703> :D
[21:53] <Cheri703> hehehe
[21:53] <Unit193> (Switched back, of course)
[21:54] <Cheri703> I'm leaving it!
[21:54] <Cheri703> I have everything dark so normal notifications disappear
[21:54] <Cheri703> and if my phone is on silent or in another room, I need the visual notification
