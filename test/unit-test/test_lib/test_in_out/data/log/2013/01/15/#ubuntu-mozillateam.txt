=== m_conley is now known as m_conley_away
[09:54] <jmux> Hi. I'm trying to build 17esr firefox packages. When I built 10esr, debian/rules get-orig-source created an orig tarball. Current firefox package source doesn't include a tarball but the source.
[09:55] <jmux> How should I currently checkout the current source?
[09:56] <jmux> And is there a way to rename the package (like firefox-17esr), which I can install parallel?
