[00:15] <RAOF> chrisccoulson: Why does Thunderbird make it so difficult to send plain-text email?
[00:22] <TheMuso> RAOF: How so? I've never had a problem sending plain text email...
[00:22] <TheMuso> Mind you I always set things up such that I view plain text emails, and make sure my replies are sent as plain text only.
[00:24] <desrt> RAOF: you just have to find the right places to turn it off
[00:24] <desrt> RAOF: i agree -- it's pretty damn obnoxious
[00:24] <desrt> RAOF: consider, though, that mozilla is very very much about html, as a company
[00:24] <desrt> and it makes a bit of sense
[00:24] <RAOF> Yeah.
[00:29] <micahg> RAOF: it's one preference
[00:30] <RAOF> micahg: Where?
[00:30] <micahg> Edit -> preferences -> composition -> Send OPtions
[00:31] <RAOF> And add * to Plain Text Domains?
[00:32] <micahg> hrm, that's not what I thought it was
[00:32] <RAOF> Yeah, that's where I looked first, but it doesn't have a “Just send plain text, damnit” option.
[00:33] <desrt> i think it's a per-account setting or something
[00:33] <desrt> i remember it _not_ being easy to find
[00:34] <desrt> ya... under account settings for each account
[00:34] <desrt> there is a checkbox in "Composition and addressing"
[00:34] <RAOF> Ah, yes. There we go.
[00:34] <RAOF> Good work on that dialog being > 768 pixels high, by the way.
[00:35] <lifeless> WIN
[00:38] <TheMuso> HTML in email really shoudl have been banned years ago.
[00:39] <TheMuso> Its a bitch when I get emails that don't have a plain text equivalent.
[00:39] <TheMuso> Whoops, meant pain, a little milder...
[00:39] <desrt> heh
[00:40] <desrt> i'm infuriated enough when i get html-only email that i can't even imagine...
[00:45] <lifeless> TheMuso: bitch is fine :>
[00:49] <TheMuso> heh ok.
[00:50] <lifeless> TheMuso: if it was aimed at someone, it definitely wouldn't be
[00:50] <lifeless> TheMuso: but its very mild on the swearometer, and you are normally -so- polite ... :)
[00:51] <desrt> lifeless: i find people's swearometers are calibrated differently according to country
[00:53] <lifeless> desrt: yeah
[01:39] <RAOF> Man, those fglrx-updates/nvidia
[01:40] <RAOF> Man, those fglrx-updates/nvidia-updates SRUs are a gnarly mass of unknown status.
[01:40] <duflu> RAOF: Unknown status?
[01:41] <RAOF> duflu: It's hard to determine what the status of the various pieces are. Have the updates been verified? Which packages are verified? What about Godot?
[01:41] <duflu> RAOF: So the usual... just trust us... this new version is better :)
[01:42] <duflu> Or are they being uploaded without any -proposed testing?
[01:43] <RAOF> Oh, they're in -proposed now.
[01:43] <RAOF> I'm just trying to work out whether they should be move from -proposed to -updates.
[01:44] <duflu> RAOF: Mind-reading of graphics vendors is in your job description, no?
[01:45] <RAOF> Oh, thsi is a problem partially of my own making. The *bugs* are a gnarly mass of confusion.
[01:47] <RAOF> Ok. So the only thing preventing fglrx-updates from hitting precise-proposed is https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer-updates/+bug/1039397 not being verified.

[02:20] <bryce> RAOF, yeah it's quite a confusing mess.  Think the verification requirements are being overly strict?
[02:22] <RAOF> bryce: Not really. Two of the bugs linked in the SRU are not actually bugs, so can't be verified. That's my fault for letting the package into proposed.
[02:22] <bryce> part of the problem is the installer for the proprietary drivers involves a bit of playing russian roulette

[11:26] <ogra_> seb128, hmm, i have a slight problem with gsettings on the nexus ... we ship http://paste.ubuntu.com/1562339/ ... and in dconf-editor i can see "suspend" being the setting thats used, nontheless it gives me the interactive dialog *until* i once switch the setting in dconf-editor manually once
[11:26] <ogra_> any idea what that could be ?
[11:29] <seb128> ogra_, do you run glib-compile-schemas on rootfs/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/ubuntu-defaults-nexus7-powerbtn.override  to get gschemas.compiled updated?
[11:29] <seb128> ogra_, the glib triggers take care of that on the system when installing package, not sure that happens for your rootfs
[11:29] <ogra_> i thought dh does that automatically
[11:30] <ogra_> oh, rootfs is only a package path
[11:30] <ogra_> the binary package puts it in /
[11:30] <ogra_> (some weird setup of the ubuntu-defaults stuff)
[11:30] <seb128> ogra_, gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power
[11:31] <ogra_> well, i changed it now, let me reset it first
[11:31] <seb128> what does that give when it's behaving buggy?
[11:31] <seb128> k
[11:31] <ogra_> well, dconf-editor showed the right value
[11:31] <pitti> seb128: ah, wrt. https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-r-gnome-plans-review I wasn't sure whether the "update .." ones were DONE already, as we don't yet have their final versions
[11:31] <ogra_> ("suspend")
[11:32] <seb128> pitti, well, we are on the unstable serie and will track it through version, I think it's good enough for the workitems, but feel free to change it back if they are useful for tracking for you
[11:32] <pitti> seb128: so you think they are enough for "get to current GNOME 3.7.x version", and the rest will just be part of the normal update cycle?
[11:32] <seb128> pitti, yes
[11:32] <pitti> seb128: I'm on d-devel-list, so through that I should get a reminder for new devel releases
[11:33] <ogra_> seb128, "set to default" in dconf-editor gets me "suspend" back in the value field and makes the entry non-bold ... though pressing the power button now gets me the dialog again
[11:33] <pitti> seb128: if you are also watching, please feel free to prod me if I forget
[11:33] <seb128> pitti, well, I'm watching http://people.canonical.com/~platform/desktop/desktop.html in any case ;-)
[11:33] <seb128> pitti, will do
[11:33]  * pitti te donne une accolade
[11:33]  * seb128 hugs pitti back
[11:34] <seb128> ogra_, if the gsettings command return the right value then there is probably a bug in gnome-session...
[11:34] <ogra_> ogra@nexus7:~$ gsettings get org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.power button-power
[11:34] <ogra_> 'interactive'
[11:34] <ogra_> ogra@nexus7:~$
[11:34] <ogra_> aha
[11:34] <ogra_> funny, why does dconf show the other value
[11:35] <ogra_> could it be that i miss any quoting in the .override file ?
[11:36] <pitti> seb128: is https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/desktop-r-gnome-fallback even relevant for this cycle still?
[11:37] <pitti> seb128: i. e. do we want to move the automounting code in this cycle to be prepared, or move it to free resources for nexus 7 and friends?
[11:37] <seb128> ogra_, dconf-editor is hackish, gsettings lacks the api it needs so it does guess work by parsing schemas itself
[11:38] <seb128> pitti, yes that spec is still revelant, and it would be good to clean/move the automount code, that's not the highest item on the list though
[11:39] <seb128> ogra_, try ='suspend' yes (with the '')
[11:42] <ogra_> no change
[11:42] <ogra_> even tried double quotes
[11:42] <ogra_> it is a list value, i wonder if it needs special treatment due to that
[11:44] <ogra_> hmm, no it says string

[11:52] <didrocks> Laney: btw, the 2nd blog post should answer to some of your question about how to interact with them
[11:52] <didrocks> them beeing the PS packages
[11:52] <didrocks> Laney: if you have any question, I think we should file a FAQ in the end
[11:52] <didrocks> (that I'll paste to a wiki page)
[11:53] <Laney> didrocks: awesome, will read!
[11:55] <Laney> I think I want a simple document that just says
[11:55] <Laney>  - bzr branch <whatever>
[11:55] <Laney>  - hack hack hack
[11:55] <Laney>  - bzr commit --fixes=lp:foo; bzr push lp:~/...; bzr lp-propose ...
[11:55] <didrocks> Laney: can you add that to the desktop pad?
[11:55] <Laney>  - set commit message on MP
[11:55] <didrocks> Laney: I'll grab the questions for doing the FAQ
[11:56] <Laney> ok I'll add my questions there
[11:56] <didrocks> thanks :)
[11:56] <Laney> yubikeyyyyyyyyyy
[11:56] <didrocks> Laney: part 3 will be really on the daily release process, what's the bots are doing and so on
[11:59] <ogra_> seb128, argh ...
[11:59] <seb128> ogra_, ?
[11:59] <ogra_> so the file needs to end in .gschema.override, not in .override
[11:59] <ogra_> :P
[11:59]  * ogra_ slaps forehead
[11:59] <seb128> lol
[11:59] <seb128> sure
[11:59] <seb128> sorry I didn't pay attention to the filename
[12:02] <Laney> didrocks: what happened here: https://launchpadlibrarian.net/128756347/indicator-power_12.10.6daily13.01.17-0ubuntu1_12.10.6daily13.01.18-0ubuntu1.diff.gz - no explanation of the changes in the changelog?
[12:03] <didrocks> Laney: because nobody attached a bug to their branch, I'm keep telling them to do that, please join the effort :)
[12:03] <Laney> interesting
[12:03] <xnox> Laney: i guess lp:indicator-power has commit messages.
[12:03] <Laney> I'm sure it does
[12:04] <didrocks> right, but commit messages can be noisy and not really explanatory
[12:04] <didrocks> that's why I decided to limit at bug reports, which is what we generally list for any releases
[12:04] <Laney> does it use the commit message you can set on MPs if they are set?
[12:04] <seb128> you also don't want an hundred commit messages listed in debian/changelog if there is an hundred commits
[12:04] <xnox> "g_type_init() is deprecated as of glib 2.35.4, so bump our glib minimum requirement and remove the g_type_init() call."
[12:04] <xnox> is the commit message and whould be useful.
[12:04] <didrocks> xnox: in that case, yeah, but not the general rule
[12:05] <Laney> I did a MP for something the other day and got told to set a commit message there
[12:05] <seb128> there is also the changelog spam effect
[12:05] <xnox> didrocks: what about using first line only? (git-dch style)
[12:05] <Laney> should those be generally useful?
[12:05] <xnox> * [-r161] g_type_init() is deprecated as of glib 2.35.4, so bump our glib minimum requirement and ...
[12:05] <didrocks> xnox: will cut in the middle a commit message, even worse
[12:05] <didrocks> xnox: they don't use that the "short/long summary"
[12:05] <didrocks> s/that//
[12:05] <xnox> clearly we should switch to git then
[12:05] <seb128> Laney, those are a requirement for the merger bot, not sure why anymore, something to do with the readability of the vcs logs I think
[12:05]  * xnox hides
[12:06] <didrocks> Laney: and it's only on the unity stack, different teams are using different flows, other are just taking the description then
[12:06] <Laney> seb128: Perhaps. I've never known what they are for really but it could be useful in this case
[12:06] <didrocks> (see part 2 ;))
[12:06] <didrocks> and I think this doesn't solve the changelog spam
[12:07] <didrocks> I think important changes needs to have a bug attached
[12:07] <didrocks> or being just specified manually in debian/changelog as part of the merge
[12:07] <didrocks> this is more an educational thing than anything else
[12:07] <didrocks> larsu: btw, can you keep that in mind when reviewing/doing changes please? ^
[12:09] <larsu> didrocks, is a --fixes lpXXXX on the commit enough?
[12:09] <larsu> or associating the MR with the bug?
[12:09] <didrocks> larsu: either the one, or the other, or even just mentionning "this fixes bug #XXXX" any commit message of the changes
[12:09] <didrocks> s/the one/this/
[12:10] <didrocks> I'm quite flexible to spot that :)
[12:10] <didrocks> you don't want to see the regexp :p
[12:10] <larsu> haha
[12:10] <larsu> okay :)
[12:11] <didrocks> thanks!
[12:11] <Laney> hmmmmm
[12:11] <larsu> didrocks, np, I actually prefer having a bug reference myself
[12:11] <larsu> I just forget sometimes
[12:11] <didrocks> and you get the praise then!
[12:11] <didrocks> with your name :)
[12:12] <didrocks> in the changelog :p
[12:12] <Laney> does it already do one changelog entry per MP?
[12:12] <didrocks> one changelog entry per bug
[12:12] <didrocks> as you would find in any NEWS file
[12:13] <Laney> ack
[12:13] <Laney> so it feels a bit heavy to make people file bugs when they can just JFDI a fix
[12:14] <didrocks> Laney: well, if they don't want to file bugs, they can themselve add it to debian/changelog as part of the MP
[12:14] <didrocks> if they feel it's important enough to get communicated
[12:14] <Laney> ah, that is allowed eh
[12:14] <didrocks> yep :)
[12:14] <Laney> we get to my questions on the pad now
[12:14] <Laney> so let's leave it here :P
[12:14] <didrocks> yep :)
[12:14] <didrocks> and if they already referenced the bug in the changelog
[12:15] <didrocks> there is no duplication

[15:03] <larsu> desrt, another question: g_main_context_pending seems to return FALSE if there are no immediate sources to be dispatched. Is there a function to find out whether there are *any* sources?
[15:03] <bcurtiswx> dental floss OK ?
[15:03] <desrt> larsu: you have to poll...
[15:03] <larsu> :-/
[15:03] <desrt> so like prepare/query/poll/check

[15:04] <larsu> desrt, care to add a function that does this?
[15:04] <desrt> we talked about adding this to gmaincontext
[15:04] <desrt> but you don't want it
[15:04] <larsu> why?
[15:04] <desrt> because 'pending' is a very difficult term
[15:04] <desrt> is a timeout that will fire in 1 second from now pending?
[15:04] <larsu> well, I just spend 20 minutes finding out "pending" is not what I thought it meant
[15:05] <larsu> YES.
[15:05] <desrt> okay
[15:05] <desrt> how about a pending async result that will fire 1 second from now?
[15:05] <larsu> yes
[15:05] <desrt> that's the problem
[15:05] <larsu> because you don't know about these?
[15:05] <desrt> async results don't become GSources until they are (immediately) ready to dispatch
[15:05] <larsu> right
[15:06] <desrt> so that made us think maybe we should have like g_main_context_hold() as a sort of special "don't exit now!" ref
[15:06] <desrt> then the whole thing just started feeling too much like GApplication
[15:07] <larsu> hm, and that's a bad thing?
[15:07] <desrt> meh
[15:07] <desrt> it would require changes everywhere
[15:07] <desrt> everyone who may at some point add an idle would have to call this hold()
[15:08] <desrt> i guess GTask and GSimpleAsyncResult could be updated to do that...
[15:08] <desrt> but this is starting to get out of hand, wouldn't you agree?
[15:08] <desrt> https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690126 is the bug btw
[15:08] <ubot2> Gnome bug 690126 in gdbus "Do not quit mainloop while there are pending GSources" [Normal,Assigned]
[15:15] <larsu> desrt, agreed. It seemed like an easy thing at first :)
[15:24] <desrt> larsu: did you do a lesson yet? :)
[15:24] <larsu> desrt, no :(
[15:24] <desrt> dude
[15:25] <desrt> you're going to be in toronto in two weeks and unable to speak the local language
[15:25] <larsu> there's just so much other stuff I need to take care of
[15:25] <desrt> lessons are quick :p
[15:25] <larsu> I do have the tab open, does that count?
[15:25] <larsu> for something?
[15:26] <desrt> hahahah
[15:26] <desrt> you TODO list by tab, hm?
[15:26] <larsu> not usually, only in this case
[15:26] <larsu> because I actually meant to do it :)
[15:27] <desrt> whenever i see ken he always says "haven't heard from lars yet..."
[15:28] <larsu> he already know me?
[15:28] <larsu> *knows
[15:28] <desrt> he knows you will be sending lessons soon :)
[15:28] <larsu> heh
[16:11] <didrocks> grrr, on 3G

[17:07] <dobey> seb128: can i get you or someone to look at my patch on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-keyring/+bug/859600 please?
[17:07] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 859600 in gnome-keyring (Ubuntu Precise) "Please convert gnome-keyring to multiarch" [High,In progress]
[17:16] <seb128> dobey, will have a look
[17:21] <dobey> seb128: thanks
[17:27] <xnox> dobey: i think last time around this was attempted, the use case was to have the library co-installed and the problem was that the /etc/ conffile encodes multiarch path.
[17:27] <xnox> which means that conf file is no longer the same across all architectures and thus failing to co-install.
[17:27] <xnox> has this been addressed?
[17:28]  * xnox can't figure that bit out just by looking at the patch.
[17:28]  * xnox didn't build both amd64/i386 & try to co-install them yet.
[17:30] <dobey> xnox: which conf file?
[17:31] <xnox> let me dig into it. 1sec.
[17:31] <dobey> xnox: i have them co-installed on my machine from my ppa right now.
[17:31] <xnox> awesome =)
[17:31] <dobey> xnox: the p11kit conf file only has the module name in it
[17:31] <xnox> hmm..
[17:32] <dobey> /etc/pkcs11/modules/gnome-keyring.module that file, that is
[17:40] <xnox> dobey: why is the patch against oneiric and not raring?!
[17:41] <dobey> xnox: eh?
[17:41] <dobey> +gnome-keyring (3.6.2-0ubuntu2) raring; urgency=low
[17:41] <xnox> dobey: i downloaded not your patch...
[17:41] <dobey> xnox: you're not looking at *my* patch :)
[17:42] <xnox> i was looking at your patch, but my clipboard had the other url in it...
[17:42] <dobey> oh
[17:42] <xnox> =) all is fine now.
[17:43] <dobey> thanks

[18:36] <LIDH> Hello, I have Ubuntu 12.10 and a POS system EBN X-950 with touchscreen (EgalaxyTouch according to the manual), so, i tried $lsusb and it doesn't list the touchscreen controller. If I do a screen /dev/ttyS[0-4] can't get any input from the touchscreen. Already did $ modprobe -r usbtouchscreen and still doesn't detect, any ideas what's the problem?
[18:43] <dobey> LIDH: #ubuntu is the general help channel
[18:43] <LIDH> ok
[18:43] <LIDH> thank you but i've already post there, and no one helped me :s
[18:45] <dobey> well be patient
[18:46] <dobey> if you're impatient, nobody will want to help you :)

[20:13] <chrisccoulson> hi seb128. sorry, was away for dinner and exercise
[20:13] <chrisccoulson> yeah, i'll include that change too
[20:14] <seb128> chrisccoulson, no worry, thanks ;-)
[20:15] <seb128> chrisccoulson, I hope for you it's "exercise and dinner", not good to go to cycle after eating ;-)
[21:00] <robru> mterry, if you get a sec I'd like to ask you some questions about that mp you sent me
[21:00] <mterry> robru, the deja-dup one?  sure
[21:00] <robru> mterry, yeah, so, what steps should I take to ensure that your change is working
[21:00] <robru> ?
[21:04] <mterry> robru, well make check is always good, but I only fixed the existing tests to work with the code change, I didn't add any new tests for it, because I didn't know how to fake partitions without root access
[21:04] <mterry> robru, so I personally verified it manually.   The trick is to do a backup from a partition that is different than the partition /tmp is on
[21:05] <mterry> robru, then run "G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all deja-dup --backup" and notice the arguments we pass to duplicity.  There should be a --tempdir with an appropriate (same partition as source files) directory
[21:05] <robru> mterry, yeah, that's what i meant. so my home directory is different than tmp
[21:05] <mterry> robru, so deja-dup should pass ~/.cache/deja-dup/tmp as tempdir to duplicity
[21:06] <robru> mterry, oh, btw, I started using deja-dup for my actual, real $HOME backups. Will that command interfere with the backups I have going?
[21:06] <robru> should i make a dummy user for this? ;-)
[21:08] <mterry> robru, it will use your normal settings to make a backup yeah.  But it won't (shouldn't) interfere with them, just start a new backup
[21:08] <robru> mterry, so it'll try to backup all 500GBs then? maybe I will make a dummy user ;-)
[21:08] <mterry> robru, you also might want to double confirm that ~/.cache/deja-dup/tmp is empty after the run
[21:09] <mterry> robru, well, it will do an incremental or whatever, but if you haven't made a first backup yet, then yah.  dummy or change your backup settings momentarily
[21:09] <robru> mterry, ok, great. I'll try it out shortly. thanks
[21:49] <robru> mterry, I'm getting a weird xmllint error on 'make check'
[21:49] <mterry> xmllint?
[21:50] <mterry> paste me
[21:50] <robru> mterry, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1564351/ does this mean anything to you?
[21:50] <robru> probably a missing dep or something simple
[21:50] <mterry> robru, oh, I bet the gnome-docs automake stuff is missing a dep on the 'all' target for the 'check' target
[21:50] <robru> but I'm not sure
[21:50] <mterry> robru, run make && make check
[21:51] <robru> ahhh
[21:52] <robru> in unrelated news, today I found a little netbook of mine that's been in storage since November. It had raring installed on it... now I'm just installing all 905 updates ;-)
[21:53] <robru> mterry, ok, xmllint is passing, tests are going ok so far, just have to do the manual checks and then I'll approve your branch
[21:54] <mterry> robru, cool.  Thanks!
[21:54] <mterry> robru, heh, only 905?!
[21:56] <robru> mterry, well, it was put in storage *late* in november ;-)
[21:56] <robru> so just 905 updates for december/jan
[21:57] <mterry> :)
[22:07] <robru> mterry, ok, so if I see '--tempdir=/home/robru/.cache/deja-dup/tmp' in the debugging output, then that for sure means it worked? ~/.cache/deja-dup/tmp directory was never used prior to this branch?
[22:08] <mterry> robru, right
[22:08] <mterry> robru, nor was --tempdir either
[22:09] <robru> mterry, k, great. just gonna peruse the diff briefly then approve ;-)
[22:17] <mterry> robru, I just noticed something myself looking at the diff
[22:17] <robru> oh?
[22:17] <mterry> robru, I changed DuplicityInstance.start from normal to async.  And thus dropped it's 'throw Error' line
[22:17] <robru> ... ok?
[22:18] <mterry> robru, but, when I called it from DuplicityJob before, I would bubble up the error message via show_error().  In this new diff, the error message gets swallowed by DuplicityInstance and the user will end up just seeing a generic "Unknown error" message
[22:18] <mterry> robru,  let me fix that real quick
[22:18] <robru> ok
[22:22] <robru> mterry, oh, I like the way you allow this tempdir logic to be overridden by an env variable. That's thinking ahead ;-)
[22:31] <mterry> robru, I fixed the issue I found locally, but I decided to write a test for this case for the future.  But I have to run.  So I'll update tomorrow
[22:31] <robru> mterry, ok
[22:34] <mterry> robru, thanks for the review!
[22:34] <robru> mterry, yw, have a good night!
