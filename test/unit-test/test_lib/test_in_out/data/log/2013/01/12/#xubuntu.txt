[03:51] <c2tarun> Hi friends, I have a problem, if some applications crashes is there any setting in Xubuntu to automatically relaunch that app? Like yesterday I was downloading setup of Xubuntu 12.10 I left my machine on at night so that downloading finishes. But Deluge crashed and when I checked in morning :( only 20% was downloaded.
[03:51] <ball> Is Deluge a bittorrent client?
[03:52] <c2tarun> ball, yes
[03:52] <ball> c2tarun: rtorrent seems to work well for me.
[03:53]  * c2tarun trying rtorrent
[03:54] <c2tarun> ball, its a command prompt client :P
[03:54] <c2tarun> ball, does it work for Magnetic URLs?
[03:55] <ball> Never heard of those.
[03:55] <c2tarun> Never?? O_O
[03:56] <ball> c2tarun: Never.
[03:58] <xubuntu611> hi
[03:58] <c2tarun> ball, ever tried downloading anything from piratebay.org some time back I heard they completely move to Magnetic URLs instead of .torrent files
[03:58] <ball> hello xubuntu611
[03:58] <ball> c2tarun: Don't think I've ever been to piratebay.org
[03:58] <ball> I use bittorrent to fetch OS ISO images.
[04:00] <c2tarun> may be torrents are blocked or not so popular in USA.
[04:00] <xubuntu611> use proxy
[04:00] <ball> c2tarun: they work fine for me.
[04:02] <ball> ...and I live in the U.S.
[04:02] <c2tarun> ball, sorry to ask, is there any difference b/w US and USA?
[04:03] <ball> c2tarun: They are the same.
[04:03] <c2tarun> thats what I thought
[04:03] <ball> People sometimes say "United States of America" and other times shorten that to "United States".
[04:15] <ball> c2tarun: Goodnight.
[04:15] <rickybobby_> I just bought a new acer aspire v5.  It has a touch screen and I am wondering if there would be any complications in using xubuntu.
[04:16] <bazhang> try a live usb/ live cd
[04:17] <c2tarun> rickybobby_, and please do post if it works :) I also want to know.
[04:52] <Offerlam> have anyone tried xubuntu on the HP gen 8 servers?
[05:25] <Pezikrypt> Good evening.
[05:26] <Pezikrypt> I can't get my wireless connection to work with my Xubuntu Session, any suggestions? I have selected Bridge-mode in the VM settings.
[05:27] <pleia2> since it's a VM it will use the host's network and it will treat it as wired
[05:28] <pleia2> and you'll have to have bridging enabled on your host machine (not sure how that's done in windows)
[05:28] <Pezikrypt> Okay, I'll look it up.
[06:25] <MoL0ToV> hi to all
[06:29] <MoL0ToV> i have a problem, if i click on firefox user e password fields on gmail, the keyboard don't write (after latest updates) howto fix?
[06:31] <baizon> MoL0ToV: have you tried a different browser?
[06:33] <MoL0ToV> yes
[06:33] <MoL0ToV> the xfce one works
[07:09] <c2tarun> MoL0ToV, there was a problem with firefox that until the site is loaded is completely you cannot type. Try with chrome or chromium once.
[07:13] <baizon> MoL0ToV: or you can try to "reset" firefox
[07:13] <baizon> i mean the settings
[07:25] <MoL0ToV> ok thx
[07:26] <MoL0ToV> i tryed to delete completely the .mozilla folder
[07:26] <MoL0ToV> but do't work
[07:27] <MoL0ToV> strange..
[07:27] <MoL0ToV> what are the defaul xubuntu login manager? gdm? lightdm?
[07:35] <Unit193> MoL0ToV: In current versions, lightdm.
[07:44] <MoL0ToV> howto change the default login manager?
[07:48] <Unit193> Install another one.
[07:50] <MoL0ToV> ok
[07:50] <MoL0ToV> but if i have 2
[07:50] <MoL0ToV> howto select what to use?
[07:53] <baizon> MoL0ToV: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/07/how-to-switch-between-gdm-lightdm-or.html
[07:58] <MoL0ToV> another question: howto grab a screenshot in xubuntu?
[07:58] <MoL0ToV> print key don't work..
[08:01] <WalterN> just go to the menu -> Accessories -> Screenshot
[08:07] <MoL0ToV> thx
[08:10] <WalterN> there is probably some keyboard shortcut to bring it up too, donno what it might be
[08:10] <WalterN> or you could make your own
[08:36] <xubuntu847> I did a fresh xubuntu 12.04 install.  Need to put virtualbox so I can use MS Office (not my choice, libre doesn't help).  But I can't install virtualbox: unresolved dependencies.  Couldn't find answer from google? Any help
[08:41] <xubuntu847> no one?
[08:41] <baizon> xubuntu847: how do you install it?
[08:42] <xubuntu847> from ubuntu software center and also by sudo ... install virtualbox-ose
[08:43] <baizon> which dependencie is it?
[08:44] <xubuntu847> The following packages have unmet dependencies:  virtualbox-qt: Depends: libgcc1 (>= 1:4.1.1) but 1:4.6.3-1ubuntu5 is to be installed                Depends: libqt4-network (>= 4:4.5.3) but 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3 is to be installed                Depends: libqt4-opengl (>= 4:4.7.2) but 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3 is to be installed                Depends: libqtcore4 (>= 4:4.8.0) but 4:4.8.1-0ubuntu4.3 is to be installed                Depen
[08:45] <baizon> xubuntu847: try https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
[08:46] <xubuntu847> trying now, thank you
[08:48] <baizon> np
[09:17] <xubuntu079> will MS Office 2010 Pro edition 64-bit work via wine in xubuntu 12.04?
[09:18] <xubuntu079> for the installer, it says garbage: http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?appId=31
[09:20] <baizon> well seems not to work yet
[09:20] <baizon> only 32bit
[09:35] <Pezikrypt> Is anyone here familiar with getting a wireless internet connection to be shared from the HOST to a VM (Running XUbuntu 12.10)?
[09:41] <Name141> what XFCE version is in Xubuntu 12.10 ?
[09:41] <Pezikrypt> Well, if you tell me how to find that out, I can tell you?
[09:41] <Pezikrypt> (I'm completely new to Linux, period.)
[09:42] <xubuntu079> I'm trying to install Win7-64 bit in virtualbox, but I got this:
[09:42] <xubuntu079> VT-x/AMD-V hardware acceleration has been enabled, but is not operational. Your 64-bit guest will fail to detect a 64-bit CPU and will not be able to boot.  Please ensure that you have enabled VT-x/AMD-V properly in the BIOS of your host computer.
[09:42] <TheSheep> !info xfce4
[09:42] <ubottu> xfce4 (source: xfce4): Meta-package for the Xfce Lightweight Desktop Environment. In component universe, is optional. Version 4.10.0 (quantal), package size 4 kB, installed size 31 kB
[09:42] <Name141> xubuntu079: did you enable it in BIOS
[09:42] <xubuntu079> name141: go to mouse menu and click about xfce.  mine is 12.04 and xfce 4.8
[09:43] <TheSheep> xubuntu079: ^^
[09:43] <xubuntu079> I will start bios and look for this option, anything specific i need to know?
[09:45] <xubuntu079> ok, i be back after restart
[09:49] <Name141> Also, am I really losing anything by running the open source AMD/ATi drivers for the 4670 in 12.10 than I would the real ones in 12.04 ?
[09:49] <Name141> I assume a little performance ?
[09:52] <WalterN> the open source drivers are kind of amazing for AMD video cards these days, compared to video drivers of ages past
[09:53] <Name141> WalterN: So I shouldn't let that be the deciding factor in LTS vs Current?
[09:54] <WalterN> I would stick with the open source drivers myself...
[10:10] <xubuntu079> there was no option in bios for VT-x/AMD-V
[10:10] <xubuntu079> so I guess I can't install Win7-64 on virtualbox??
[10:11] <xubuntu079> Would there be a problem with 32-bit Win7?
[10:14] <TheSheep> xubuntu079: maybe ask at ##windows
[10:14] <xubuntu079> well, this is just too much. I'm going to put Win7 on this netbook directly.  Too bad, because I got it from System76. But Ubuntu was too slow.  And now I'm wasting hours trying to do virtual Win on xubuntu.
[10:14] <TheSheep> xubuntu079: good luck
[10:14] <xubuntu079> so sad, thanks for the help though.
[10:15] <TheSheep> xubuntu079: don't hesitate to drop by again if you change your mind again
[10:43] <BillHook> Hi all, excuse me, where is software sources in xubuntu? I have to add line in there...
[10:45] <bazhang>  /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:47] <BillHook> thnx
[10:47] <BillHook> now i can play dungeon crawl :)
[12:46] <freedomrun_> what is the best way to disable xscreensaver and have a simple monitor turnoff (not blank) with lightdm locking?
[13:32] <fego> hello, anyother way to make the xubuntu installation more eyecandy with 3d effects, without compiz
[13:33] <fego> ?
[13:50] <b00010111> I can not image why someone would need eye candy at the installation process.
[14:28] <fego> b00010111: sorry, i think i was not been able to clarify. I just wanted to have some visual effects without using compiz.
[14:29] <fego> like the 3d window effects and others
[14:40] <ochosi> fego: the only alternative would be to use mutter, xfce's compositor doesn't do effects apart from transparency and shadows
[14:41] <ochosi> or another 3d window-manager, there should be a few others (although not too mnay)
[14:42] <fego> thanks ochosi for the reply, i am googling mutter for more info.
[14:42] <ochosi> well it's gnome3's window manager
[14:42] <ochosi> i'm not sure how much of gnome3 it would actually pull if you installed it, but probably a lot
[15:19] <bernz> anyone know where to find a list of the minimal system fonts in standard xubuntu quantal? (yes, i have asked google already)
[15:20] <bernz> (that is, i don't want any extra/free fonts, only the ones needed by the default window manager, terminal, and whatever else)
[15:21] <ochosi> bernz: we're using droid for most things
[15:22] <bernz> ochosi, ah, that's helpful, thanks :-)
[15:22] <ochosi> bernz: although for raring we might go for a different terminal font (liberation mono)
[15:24] <bernz> if i'm messing around a lot with fonts and damage something, is there a tool for resetting the default fonts? or is it something fairly simple like replacing a directory sub-tree, and rebuilding a cache somewhere?
[15:24] <ochosi> i'm not sure what you mean with "messing aroudnd"
[15:25] <bernz> for instance, if i'm using a font manager application, but it's UI is cryptic, and i do something unintentional, like deleting all the fonts instead of a selected one
[15:25] <bernz> it's -> its, even
[15:25] <bernz> or if i manually edit files in /usr/share/fonts, and stuff like that
[15:26] <ochosi> i'd never edit files in /usr/share/fonts, simply install new fonts in /home/$user/fonts
[15:26] <ochosi> err
[15:26] <ochosi> .fonts i mean
[15:26] <bernz> oh! i was getting a message about that being deprecated, safe to ignore for now?
[15:27] <bernz> (when i, for instance, run "fc-cache -f")
[15:27] <ochosi> i never forcibly updated the font-cache (honestly it didn't seem needed), so i couldn't say. the dir definitely works though
[15:28] <bernz> okay... i found some web tutorial on installing a single new font without using a font manager, and it suggested to copy the font to a certain place, and then rebuild the cache
[15:28] <bernz> i will undo that and switch to using the home-dir
[15:28] <ochosi> yeah, it's safer
[15:28] <bernz> thanks for the advice :-)
[15:28] <ochosi> you shouldn't have to update the font-cache by hand btw
[15:29] <bernz> okay
[15:29] <ochosi> just store a font in the .fonts dir and then re-open the app you want to use it in
[15:29] <bernz> nice
[15:29] <bernz> i mostly wanted a font manager to browse a large collection, and pick out stuff i'm going to use more than once, and "import it" into my system
[15:30] <bernz> so instead, i'll just copy the ones i like into my home-dir
[15:30] <ochosi> yup
[15:31] <bernz> coolness, thanks again
[15:31] <ochosi> np
[15:31] <bernz> i'm off to try some stuff then :-)
[15:31] <bernz> bye for now
[15:42] <MoL0ToV> xfce how manages the ptp camera devices?
[15:42] <MoL0ToV> on gnome a popup permit to transfer files
[15:42] <MoL0ToV> here nothing appears
[15:43] <GothSpark> hi all how can mount a file system using the live cd because i get the uuid error everytime i try to mount my harddrive
[15:44] <ochosi> MoL0ToV: nothing happens by default, but you should be able to access your camera with gthumb (which is installed by default)
[15:45] <MoL0ToV> don't work
[15:46] <MoL0ToV> i cannot see the device
[15:48] <ochosi> then you might be able to check whether there are drivers you can install, but in general i 'm probably the wrong person to help because i don't have sucha ceamera
[15:49] <MoL0ToV> in gnome all works
[15:52] <ochosi> MoL0ToV: so what programme are you using in gnome?
[15:53] <MoL0ToV> i don't know
[15:53] <MoL0ToV> i see the icon of the phone on the desktop
[15:55] <ochosi> so probably it's the filebrowser?
[15:58] <MoL0ToV> i don't know
[15:58] <MoL0ToV> is not a problem, i copied the file trough gnome
[16:00] <recon_lap> MoL0ToV: you trying to use a camera? try cheese.
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[16:07] <MoL0ToV> no
[16:08] <MoL0ToV> a ptp device
[16:24] <holstein> MoL0ToV: there might be a gnome service starting that you could start with XFCE as well
[16:25] <holstein> MoL0ToV: i would make sure its not just something about the default software.. try cheese as recon_lap suggests and let the volunteers here know what the outcome is
[16:29] <MoL0ToV> cheese is for webcam
[16:29] <MoL0ToV> i need simply copy a file via ptp
[16:30] <holstein> MoL0ToV: then, you dont need a camera.. you just copy the file
[16:30] <MoL0ToV> yes
[16:30] <MoL0ToV> but ptp protocol in gnome works
[16:30] <MoL0ToV> a icon with my device name appears on desktop
[16:30] <MoL0ToV> in xfce no
[16:30] <MoL0ToV> this is the problem
[16:30] <holstein> MoL0ToV: it might be helpful to remember gnome is just the environment.. that its all linux/ubuntu
[16:30] <MoL0ToV> and also gThumb don't see the device
[16:31] <holstein> MoL0ToV: is the same installation running gnome and xfce?
[16:31] <MoL0ToV> yes
[16:33] <recon_lap> MoL0ToV: what device are you trying to connect, and how are you connecting
[16:33] <holstein> MoL0ToV: i also use apps on my phone to share over wifi, so i dont need to plug it in
[16:33] <MoL0ToV> is a android 4.03 phone using ptp protocol
[16:33] <MoL0ToV> also mtp is supported by phone, but not by linux
[16:33] <recon_lap> MTP-tools might be worth a look
[16:33] <holstein> MoL0ToV: i use airdroid
[16:34] <MoL0ToV> yes is a workaround
[16:34] <MoL0ToV> usb mass storage is so pretty.. why google eliminated it from android? is stupid.
[17:38] <recon_lap> hi, can't get a DVD to play, cant seem to get the decryption installed , running 12.04. any suggestions?
[17:41] <torax> recon_lap: libdvdread4 installed?
[17:42] <recon_lap> yep, libdvdread4:  Installed: 4.2.0-1ubuntu3
[17:42] <torax> is it a new disney dvd?
[17:43] <recon_lap> house session 6 DVD
[17:44] <torax> I had problems with disney dvd, could not get it work at all
[17:45] <recon_lap> think i need libdvdcss or somthing
[17:45] <torax> you could try installing libdvdcss2
[17:47] <recon_lap> installed
[18:19] <Mch> Hello, All. Have a stupid question. Can't find detailed info about difference between desktop and alternate install. Maybe someone knows some link?
[18:20] <likemindead> Basically alt requires less resources, no Live CD option. Mch
[18:21] <likemindead> Some info here, Mch -- http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/02/01/live-cd-vs-alternate-installer/
[18:23] <Pezikrypt> Do I pick Xfce or Xubuntu for the session?
[18:24] <Mch> Thanks, likemindead. I'm trying to install xubuntu 12.10 on 367Mhz Celeron 256V of RAM. It seems that it is too large for the machine, it needs 512 min as said in minimal reqs..  I warry that alternate install has some features stripped, and trying to find their (stripped features) list. If there is less resources needed, what is cost of it?
[18:28] <recon_lap> 367Mhz Celeron?? that must be old
[18:32] <Mch> Thanks again. The shown topic got me out to use alternate one of older release instead of combined last one. They say it's far more stable. And they also noticed my exactly trouble - repeated partitioning fails.
[18:32] <likemindead> That is definitely an old machine. :-\
[18:33] <Mch> Yes! It's quite old. But it's my first machine and I simply can not let it die in vain. )
[18:35] <likemindead> Try making it a pfSense box? It meets the minimum requirements. https://duckduckgo.com/?q=pfsense
[18:38] <Mch> Thanks. I'll try alternate one first. I need gcc and some other dev tools, but  pfSense is BSD based and maybe lack of these tools. Need full featured machine with reach toolset but dwarfish resources..
[18:39] <likemindead> Tiny Core Linux, then?
[18:40] <Mch> Never heard about it. Thanks.
[18:41] <likemindead> I love Xubuntu. I always come back to Xubuntu. But for a box as old as the one you're talking about, I think you need to go with another distro tailored to those needs.
[18:43] <Mch> I used puppy for long time. But now I need some additional tools, and I got a HDD at last. So trying to migrate.
[18:44] <Mch> Somebody sais that xubuntu works even on 64M of RAM. I have much more :-) , so let's give it a try
[18:45] <likemindead> It may work. Just likely to be painfully slow.
[18:46] <likemindead> http://www.slitaz.org/en/ is another nice option.
[18:50] <Mch> if it will live too slow, then one of next ones will be slitaz. And some other distros. Maybe slackware. Know it a little on a machine like that. It also uses XFSE, and is'nt too resource dependent
[18:51] <Mch> bye, going to burn new image and feed my mega-machine. ) Hope it will work. Happy New Year (old style one soon) to all!
[19:14] <recon_lap> seems i had to setregion on my dvd player !!!
[19:19] <Pezikrypt> Do I pick XFCE SESSION or XUBUNTU SESSION?
[19:30] <Unit193> Pezikrypt: Xubuntu Session.
[19:33] <Pezikrypt> Thanks Unit.
[19:42] <harris> help!!!!!!!!!!!!! my pc is making pop noise
[19:45] <Pezikrypt> Can you be more specific?
[19:46] <Unit193> Pezikrypt: If you try Xfce session, you'll have to remove .config/xfce4 or .config to get Xubuntu Session looking normal.
[19:47] <Pezikrypt> I'm just using the Xubuntu Session. :)

[19:49] <Pezikrypt> What's the problem? Why didn't I successfully ping Google?
[19:50] <WalterN> leave off the www.
[19:52] <Pezikrypt> Okay.
[19:53] <Pezikrypt> vm-xu-1210@ubuntu:~$ ping google.com

[19:55] <molgrum> i burned a xubuntu 12.10 32-bit disc and put it into an older laptop (Acer Aspire 1300), the graphics are completely borked
[19:55] <WalterN> Pezikrypt: donno? :-x

[19:55] <molgrum> i can see the welcome screen behind
[19:56] <molgrum> the os on it (winxp) works

[20:09] <Hazey> does xubuntu have all the packages regular ubuntu has, like that software manager ubuntu has that has a nice simple GUI and you can browse for free software
[20:11] <Hazey> Ubuntu Software Centre
[20:12] <molgrum> Hazey, yes
[20:12] <Hazey> thank god
[20:12] <Hazey> i wish regular ubuntu didnt mess up gnome so badly with that sidebar
[20:16] <holstein> Hazey: xubuntu *is* ubuntu.. all the official variants use the same repos
[20:17] <Yinchie> he said regular. obviously xubuntu uses a different wm.
[20:18] <holstein> well, xubuntu does *not* have "all the packages regular ubuntu has".. but it has access to them
[20:23] <molgrum> hey hey, 12.04 seems to work better
[20:26] <holstein> molgrum: could have better support for your hardware with the older kernel
=== Thanos is now known as LiquidBlues
[21:39] <LiquidBlues> I have a USB microphone that I'm trying to use for Karaoke, but it won't loopback through the speakers.
[21:39] <LiquidBlues> Output sound is HDMI
[21:39] <holstein> LiquidBlues: thats actually kind of involved.. you can do that easily with JACK, though thats overkill for what you are doing
[21:40] <holstein> i would look at the pavucontrol settings.. i would consider not using the computer for that..
[21:40] <LiquidBlues> Well, I use it as a media server in the living room.
[21:40] <LiquidBlues> via xbmc
[21:41] <holstein> http://askubuntu.com/questions/123798/how-to-hear-my-voice-in-speakers-with-a-mic
[21:41] <holstein> LiquidBlues: sure.. im just saying, maybe just an amp and some speakers seperate
[21:41] <holstein> LiquidBlues: i would say, you'll beat your head against this for a while, and get something kind of "meh" at the end anyways
[21:42] <LiquidBlues> The LiquidBlues, he is sad.
[21:42] <holstein> LiquidBlues: i say that as an audio professional... you can get this working and get the mic going through the speakers.. ill suggest a few ways
[21:42] <holstein> the above way is how using jack would work
[21:43] <LiquidBlues> Oh, I did try this way when I googled the problem.
[21:43] <LiquidBlues> (qjackctl.real:5272): Gtk-CRITICAL **: IA__gtk_widget_get_direction: assertion `GTK_IS_WIDGET (widget)' failed
[21:43] <holstein> LiquidBlues: JACK is not trivial.. i literally use it daily though, and it easily does what you are trying to do
[21:44] <holstein> LiquidBlues: do you need jack to do this? no..  so lemme keep searching..
[21:44] <holstein> http://s8dragon.wordpress.com/2010/12/26/listen-to-microphone-over-the-speakers-using-pulseaudio/
[21:44] <LiquidBlues> Thank you so much
[21:45] <holstein> otherwise, try and do it at the amp... with a mixer.. route the computer output and the mic output that way
[21:45] <LiquidBlues> That did work
[21:46] <holstein> OR, just turn the music down a bit and sing over it
[21:46] <LiquidBlues> But yeah, latency
[21:46] <holstein> LiquidBlues: sure.. you should expect crap latency with that hardware
[21:46] <holstein> LiquidBlues: thats why i say, you're better off doing it outside the box
[21:46] <holstein> its not that you have bad hardware.. its that you have inapproriate hardware
[21:47] <LiquidBlues> Understood.
[21:47] <LiquidBlues> So, Jack solves the latency problem?
[21:47] <holstein> LiquidBlues: you can ask in #opensourcemusicians as well.. maybe there are some tricks i dont know about
[21:47] <LiquidBlues> Oh, wow.
[21:47] <LiquidBlues> TIL
[21:47] <holstein> LiquidBlues: jack might help.. but pretty much, i wouldnt expect low latency from internal sound cards..
[21:48] <holstein> JACK is overkill, and unecessary i say
[21:48] <LiquidBlues> Just because it's already processing the hdmi video?
[21:48] <holstein> LiquidBlues: for one thing, with JACK, you will choose what device you want to use.. what *singular* device you want to use.. not the USB mic in and hdmi out or whatever
[21:49] <holstein> unless, you want to hack at alsa for a bit, and get that routed to JACK, *then* you get an additional hit in performance
[21:49] <holstein> then there are kernels you can try.. then IRQ settings.. its a mess
[21:49] <LiquidBlues> Sounds like the opposite of fun.
[21:49] <LiquidBlues> I wish stuff would just, you know, work...
[21:49] <holstein> LiquidBlues: i would use pulse with what you got, and the next step for improvement is to get it out of the box
[21:50] <holstein> LiquidBlues: it is.. your computer is *not* a karaoke machine
[21:50] <holstein> LiquidBlues: keep in mind, you dont need a computer to do what you are doing
[21:50] <LiquidBlues> Yeah, but karaoke seems so simple...
[21:50] <holstein> you get a mixer... you plug in a CD player, plug in a mic and *booM*
[21:50] <holstein> OR, just dont plug in a mic and turn the music down and sing along with it without a mic
[21:50] <LiquidBlues> I hear you.
[21:51] <holstein> LiquidBlues: otherwise, you need gear that is designed for low latency.. or a sound card that routes the audio straight though.. i have that on several devices
[21:51] <LiquidBlues> So, even if I used a microphone with a 2.5mm jack, I would get the same problem?
[21:52] <LiquidBlues> vs usb
[21:52] <holstein> LiquidBlues: think of it this way.. .have you been to a karaoke jam?
[21:52] <LiquidBlues> I've never had that much to drink, no.
[21:52] <holstein> LiquidBlues: did you see *any* 2.5" jacks in action?
[21:52] <holstein> LiquidBlues: you wont
[21:52] <LiquidBlues> Gotcha
[21:52] <holstein> LiquidBlues: you might get better latency with another device, but you might not
[21:53] <holstein> LiquidBlues: what will certainly give you dead on zero latency is not sending the mic through the computer
[21:53] <holstein> you dont need to
[21:53] <holstein> its just a monitor.. a realtime signal to the speakers is all you want
[21:53] <holstein> you dont need to route that through the computer, so dont
[21:53] <LiquidBlues> I gotcha.  Was just hoping to do it without adding more gear.
[21:53] <holstein> but, you could mess around like i said before and come up with something tolerable
[21:54] <holstein> id say, take an afternoon.. 4 hours or so, and just try all the possible outcomes
[21:54] <holstein> theres really no way to say without trying them
[21:55] <holstein> those devices are not made for recieving audio, processing it, and spitting it back out
[21:55] <LiquidBlues> Nah, I'll take the word of experience over me screwing around with it and messing something up.
[21:55] <holstein> ther are made for playing audio, and maybe a skype kind of setup
[21:55] <holstein> LiquidBlues: well, you can always try with a live CD too.. the ubuntustudio and AVlinux cd's are live, and have JACK and all the goodies
[21:55] <holstein> LiquidBlues: then, you wont "break" anything you have permanently
[21:56] <LiquidBlues> Yeah, I do Google Voice on it alright.  I guess that's still a non-latency issue, though.
[21:56] <holstein> LiquidBlues: ubuntustudio is running XFCE, so it wont look too much different and it would be easy to take whatever is working with ubuntustudio and apply it to xubuntu
[21:56] <LiquidBlues> Worth a try.
[21:56] <holstein> LiquidBlues: well, even 20ms for a phone call.. or 40..
[21:57] <holstein> you can really tell 20ms though when you are trying to sing along or play an instrument
[21:57] <LiquidBlues> Yeah
[21:57] <holstein> LiquidBlues: i like to have 10.. or 2
[21:57] <holstein> 10 would be fine with what you are doing though
[21:59] <LiquidBlues> Thanks for the help in nailing it down quickly.  I appreciate it.
[21:59] <holstein> LiquidBlues: sure... its a challenge for sure.. and could be easier, but its tough with so many different devices around
[22:01] <LiquidBlues> What good is the usb mic, then?
[22:01] <holstein> LiquidBlues: what is it? a podcaster mic?
[22:02] <LiquidBlues> It's a full microphone looking thing.
[22:02] <LiquidBlues> Just usb cable
[22:02] <holstein> still, recording that signal into something like audacity would work just fine.. its expecting it to come back out of the box in realtime
[22:03] <LiquidBlues> Oh, I see.
[22:03] <holstein> LiquidBlues: its not really for "process your voice with realtime effects!"
[22:03] <holstein> its more for "record your voice with a 'quality' mic"
[22:03] <holstein> and that might be better than what you would get with a 2.5" cable.. better as far as cleaner
[22:07] <LiquidBlues> So, I have all HDMI outputs in the back.  My 5.1 receiver has an aux/in, that's about it.
[22:07] <LiquidBlues> I doubt it'll play the xbmc stuff and do the mic.
[22:07] <holstein> LiquidBlues: you could use a mixer
[22:07] <holstein> LiquidBlues: sometimes you can see these cheap at charity shops
[22:08] <LiquidBlues> YOu have an example?
[22:09] <holstein> http://www.musiciansfriend.com/pro-audio/behringer-eurorack-ub502-5-channel-compact-mixer has an actual mic inpute
[22:09] <holstein> input*
[22:10] <holstein> but, you might find something more consumer grade that will tak a stereo line in and a mic input for cheap
[22:10] <holstein> i literally donate hardware like that all the time
[22:10] <LiquidBlues> I like this one and it's not expensive.
[22:10] <LiquidBlues> But, how do I route all that with my HDMI stuff?
[22:11] <holstein> LiquidBlues: i dont know anything about your hardware
[22:11] <holstein> what would i do? i would use anything with a stereo output to play the track.. and plug a mic in and mix those 2 things
[22:12] <LiquidBlues> hmmm
[22:12] <holstein> its expensive mixing digitial with analog
[22:13] <holstein> and not necessary to do what you are trying to do
[22:13] <holstein> i would just get out of the box..
[22:14] <LiquidBlues> Or just buy singstar for my ps3.  :/
[22:14] <holstein> sure... or anything made for karaoke
[22:14] <holstein> OR, just turn the music down a bit, and dont use a mic
[22:14] <holstein> just sing.. without a mic
[22:14] <LiquidBlues> Yeah, that's probably what's going to end up happening.
[22:14] <LiquidBlues> Kids just like the sound of their voice.  :)
[22:15] <holstein> LiquidBlues: sometimes you can find crap boom boxes with mic inputs.. then they can crank/break that and not ruin your nice system
[22:16] <LiquidBlues> Even better idea.
[22:16] <holstein> yeah... then you got little in it, and they can just tear it up.. not worries
[22:16] <holstein> LiquidBlues: even if its a broken karaoke rig that the CD player doesnt work in or whatever
[22:16] <holstein> you just want a mic in
[22:19] <LiquidBlues> Okay, lots of good info.  Thank you so much.
[22:20] <holstein> LiquidBlues: cheers!
[22:33] <goly> hello!
