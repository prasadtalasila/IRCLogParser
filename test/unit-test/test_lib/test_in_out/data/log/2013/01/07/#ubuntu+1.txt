[04:13] <CarlFK> syslog is full of [   64.097806] end_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0
[04:13] <CarlFK> is that expected, or should I file a report ?
[04:35] <psusi> CarlFK, do you actually have a floppy drive?
[04:35] <CarlFK> psusi: nope
[04:36] <CarlFK> hmm.. let me check...
[04:36] <psusi> CarlFK, then you should not tell your bios that you do
[04:36] <CarlFK> old laptop
[04:50] <CarlFK> yep, no drive, but it was enabled in bios.  thanks
[04:53] <psusi> I once wrote a floppy disk driver for ReactOS... floppies are horrible hardware
[04:54] <psusi> nobody ever implemented the ability to auto detect the hardware, so you have to tell the bios what kind you have ( if any ) and the kernel has no choice but to trust your setting
[04:57] <CarlFK> yeah - and they have an eject button :)
[04:57] <CarlFK> seems mac did a better job with that
[05:44] <bjsnider> you know what really sucks? gftp hijacks ctrl+v for its own use. it doesn't paste
[05:44] <bjsnider> in fact i don't think there is a paste shortcut if you're using gftp
[05:44] <bjsnider> you'd better have a mouse

[15:55] <smb> Anybody knows which dependency now would pull in libcrypto. Trying to compile Xen under raring chroots with sbuild and the current version now fails in the configure stage.
[17:09] <bjsnider> smb, check the config.log
[17:10] <smb> bjsnider, Just found it. python-dev used to pull in libssl-dev but not anymore
[17:11] <smb> Currently recompiling the package with added dependency to be sure
[17:24] <smb> Ok, confirmed. Adding the builddep fixes the build
