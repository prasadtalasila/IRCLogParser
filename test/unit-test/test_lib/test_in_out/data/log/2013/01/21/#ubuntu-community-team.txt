[07:41] <dholbach> good morning
[09:22] <jussi> dholbach: Morning Daniel
[09:32] <dholbach> hi jussi
[09:52] <jussi> dholbach: how was the holiday?
[09:52] <dholbach> very nice
[09:52] <dholbach> I would've stayed longer ;-)
[09:53] <dholbach> how was yours?
[09:55] <jussi> excellent - glad to come home to my "own" place though - 3 weeks at the parents house is quite long enough :D
[12:35] <daker> anyone know who can we ask for bug 1075539 ?
[12:36] <popey> daker: that bug doesn't exist
[12:36] <popey> or its private and I don't have access, which I certainly used to
[12:37] <daker> popey: ya private
[12:37] <popey> damnit, I fell off the bugsquad team
[12:37] <popey> thats why I can't see it.
[12:38] <daker> popey: see now
[12:38] <daker> bug 1075539
[12:38] <daker> ah sorry
[12:38] <popey> nope, still private
[12:38] <czajkowski> it' a private bug
[12:39] <czajkowski> not even bug squad can see it
[12:39] <daker> popey: what's your LP id ?
[12:39] <czajkowski> daker: shout it be private
[12:39] <popey> popey
[12:39] <czajkowski> *should
[12:39] <popey> czajkowski: I could see private bugs until I fell off bugsquad
[12:39] <popey> so that's not the case
[12:40] <czajkowski> it depends if it's an ubuntu bug I guess then as bug squad would be on it, I'm on bug squad also and cant see it so I assumed it's not an ubuntu bug
[12:40] <czajkowski> daker: do you know what the bug should be
[12:40] <czajkowski> I can then find out more easier
[12:40] <popey> daker: feel free to add me to it
[12:42] <daker> popey: can you see it ?
[12:42] <popey> yes, I can now..
[12:42]  * popey looks
[12:43] <daker> popey: comment #7
[12:43] <czajkowski> daker: did you see my comments above :)
[12:43] <popey> i have seen this
[12:43] <popey> the nvidia card doesn't get reset properly
[12:45] <daker> czajkowski: can you see it now ?
[12:46] <popey> daker: i dont think it's a lightdm issue, it may be an xorg or unity issue, not resetting the card properly
[12:46] <daker> popey: even after the reboot ?
[12:47] <czajkowski> 3~yes
[12:47] <doctormon> lightdm issues are pretty easy to see. It crashes, you can't log in or there's something weird in /var/log/lightdm/:0.log
[12:47] <popey> well it's not lightdm which resets the card
[12:47] <czajkowski> so bug squad don't get added till the security team go through the log
[12:48] <daker> doctormon: from the bug comment : As you can see after a complete reboot, when you logged in again you have your last windows with some private information depending what you was doing before the reboot
[12:48] <doctormon> daker: Sounds like a weird ghost in the machine.
[12:49] <daker> doctormon: :)
[12:49] <popey> daker: I spoke with a unity dev about this some months back when it happened to my machine. It's not unusual, it was fixed in a previous release, but appears to have come back.
[12:51] <popey> bug 931967
[12:51] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 931967 in unity-greeter (Ubuntu Quantal) "Corrupted graphics after the login until the unity launcher appears" [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/931967
[12:52] <alourie> doctormon: hey Martin
[12:52] <popey> have marked as dupe
[12:52]  * popey lunches
[12:52] <czajkowski> old housemates in dublin used to walk around the house at night powering every single thing off
[12:53] <czajkowski> took me a morning of yelling at the kettle wondering wtf was wrong
[12:56] <daker> popey: ok thanks
[12:57]  * popey thinks czajkowski meant that for another channel â˜º
[12:57] <popey> np daker
[12:57] <alourie> doctormon: Martin, if you're available, I'm here for about half an hour, meeting after that, then available again
[12:57] <daker> popey: so it's the fix is not yet released for 12.10, right ?
[12:57] <alourie> doctormon: will be glad to help where I can
[12:57] <popey> correct daker
[12:58] <daker> popey: ok
[12:58] <popey> in progress tho
[13:02] <czajkowski> popey: good sign I need a tea and lunch :)

[15:54] <daker> dholbach: skrillex :)
[15:59] <dholbach> I haven't listened to Dubstep much lately - but this is very funny :)
[16:18] <SergioMeneses> morning!
[17:28] <pleia2> philipballew: would you be willing to move your user days session one hour earlier or later? the_hydra wanted to do a class during your slot
[17:29] <philipballew> pleia2, how about an hour later so I can sleep in?
[17:29] <pleia2> sure :)
[17:31] <philipballew> perfect
[17:40] <jcastro> hmm, jono on the ubuntu subreddit
[17:40] <jcastro> what have we created
[17:43] <dholbach> all right my friends - have a great rest of your day and see you tomorrow!
[17:44]  * popey hugs dholbach 
[17:44]  * dholbach hugs popey back
[17:49] <jono> jcastro, beauty
[17:49] <jono> lol
[17:58] <jcastro> jono: oh hey, I gave up and got that rocksmith game
[17:59] <jono> jcastro, hah, you sucker :-)
[17:59] <jono> it looks awesome though
[17:59] <jcastro> they came out with a Rush and then a Pantera pack
[17:59] <jcastro> and they had Megadeth already, I mean, the content was just _there_ for me
[18:00] <jcastro> jono: the riff learner thing is pretty brutal: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4VMIndcUg
[18:00] <jcastro> though by now I am ripping through this song pretty easily
[18:05] <jono> nice
[18:06] <jcastro> I think I'll be 60 by the time I even come close to some of these rush songs though
[18:07] <jono> jcastro, practice makes perfect :-)
[18:08] <jcastro> yeah, it's fun to play regularly
[18:08] <jcastro> I should have done this like 3 years ago
[18:08] <jcastro> now every day after work, 5-6 is all playing
[18:10] <jono> jcastro, nice!
[18:10] <jono> it is fun to just blow off steam and play
[18:14] <jcastro> man
[18:14] <jcastro> that food looks good dude
[18:15]  * jcastro is prepping for a call today so he's in irc for a bit
[19:09] <snap-l> jcastro: It's all about practice.
[19:10] <snap-l> I used to practice every day on the drums
[19:13] <JoseeAntonioR> jono: hey, keeping your Q&A on Wednesday?
[19:18] <jcastro> snap-l: we just need to find a guitarist to mess around with
[19:18] <snap-l> And I need to resurrect my kit
[19:19]  * snap-l wishes he had enough $$ / room for an electronic kit
[19:19] <snap-l> still using the kit my parents got me when I was in high school
[19:19] <snap-l> Maxwin by Perl
[19:19] <jcastro> I am mulling getting sa starter kit
[19:19] <snap-l> Total bottom-end quality, but has stood the test of time
[19:20] <snap-l> Hah, Pearl, not Perl. ;)
[19:21] <jcastro> but drums are so perplexing to me.
[19:21] <jcastro> I'm an amazing air drummer
[19:21] <snap-l> jcastro: You should find someone who plays drums to help you.
[19:21] <snap-l> I wonder who in Michigan could help out
[19:22] <snap-l> Hmmm...
[19:22] <jcastro> heh
[19:22] <jcastro> video of the day: http://vimeo.com/57685359
[19:22] <snap-l> heh
[19:25] <jcastro> whoa, they have a metallica one: http://vimeo.com/24938649#
[19:25] <jcastro> this is kind of creepy
[19:46] <doctormon> Hey alurie
[19:50] <jono> JoseeAntonioR, yes please
[19:50] <JoseeAntonioR> ok :)
