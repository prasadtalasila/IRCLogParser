[00:30] <redderhs> anyone here compile mame before?
[00:31] <redderhs> I'm trying to apply a nonag/hi-score patch to the source. I am not sure how to do it and was wondering if any of you knew how.
[00:32] <redderhs> it's pretty simple to do in windows as there's tools to do all the work for you.
[00:46] <BWMerlin> I am having trouble getting a hdd to appear under lubuntu
[00:46] <BWMerlin> the hdd works fine and I can still boot to it (it contains my windows install which I was using up until yesterday) but for some reason lubuntu is not mounting it
[00:47] <BWMerlin> it shows up both under the disks utility and under gparted
[01:02] <holstein> redderhs: i usually try native apps in the default repos. then i look for a .deb ..then i might try a PPA https://launchpad.net/~c.falco/+archive/mame
[01:03] <holstein> !mount
[01:03] <ubottu> mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount
[01:03] <holstein> BWMerlin: might be as simple as mounting it properly
[01:03] <holstein> BWMerlin: open a terminal and see that it is in "sudo fdisk -l"
[01:08] <BWMerlin> holstein: it is listed as sdc with sdc1
[01:12] <holstein> BWMerlin: so you follow the mount procedure,and try and mount it properly from the commandline, and you'll either get it mounted, or see helpful output
[01:19] <BWMerlin> I got this error message mount: /dev/sdc1 is not a block device
[01:20] <BWMerlin> and when I try on sdc I get this error message mount: unknown filesystem type 'isw_raid_member'
[01:29] <holstein> BWMerlin: i would check the format.. maybe its not a format linux reads. looks like a raid drive
[01:29] <BWMerlin> it shouldn't be
[01:30] <BWMerlin> it was a very long time ago but I fresh installed it about a year ago onto a different motherboard
[01:30] <BWMerlin> so it should just be ntfs
[01:30] <BWMerlin> fdisk -l /dev/sdc says 2048   976771071   488384512    7  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
[01:33] <holstein> sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sdc1 /media
[01:34] <holstein> i would confirm what it is... if you can see it in windows, look and see what it is...
[01:34] <BWMerlin> It is my Windows install
[01:35] <BWMerlin> still works as I was using up until yesterday
[01:35] <BWMerlin> I booted to it and ran a chkdsk on it as well and all is fine
[01:36] <BWMerlin> Error opening '/dev/sdc1': No such device or address
[01:36] <BWMerlin> Failed to mount '/dev/sdc1': No such device or address
[01:36] <BWMerlin> Either the device is missing or it's powered down, or you have
[01:36] <BWMerlin> SoftRAID hardware and must use an activated, different device under
[01:36] <BWMerlin> /dev/mapper/, (e.g. /dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1) to mount NTFS.
[01:36] <BWMerlin> Please see the 'dmraid' documentation for help.
[01:36] <holstein> BWMerlin: thats what it looks like to me.. a raid
[01:36] <BWMerlin> I wonder why it is in raid
[01:36] <holstein> BWMerlin: i dont know your windows configuration
[01:37] <BWMerlin> and it seems i don't either
[01:37] <holstein> !dmraid
[01:37] <holstein> that would be just too easy...
[01:37] <BWMerlin> http://www.overclockers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=670463 here mentions I can use sudo dmraid -rE /dev/sdc  to clear the raid metadata
[01:37] <holstein> !info dmraid
[01:37] <ubottu> dmraid (source: dmraid): Device-Mapper Software RAID support tool. In component main, is optional. Version 1.0.0.rc16-4.1ubuntu9 (quantal), package size 25 kB, installed size 136 kB
[01:38] <holstein> what would i do? make another drive to "share" between windows and linux
[01:38] <holstein> i think you can break that windows install
[01:38] <holstein> i would just use dropbox or a USB stick
[01:38] <BWMerlin> I think I will boot into Windows one last time and shadow protect it
[01:38] <holstein> and next time, think and plan for sharing from the first
[01:39] <BWMerlin> then I can see about running the raid metadata cleaner
[01:39] <BWMerlin> I don't want to share
[01:39] <holstein> then why mount it?
[01:39] <BWMerlin> I just want to retrieve files when I need them
[01:39] <holstein> just boot the OS
[01:39] <holstein> if you want to "retrieve files" thats what i am implying by sharing
[01:40] <holstein> a windows/linux friendly partition labeled "data" for example
[01:40] <BWMerlin> thought you were implying that I would be booting both OS and copying files back and forth
[01:40] <holstein> nope.. a place that any OS can access... a USB stick.. or dropbox that just syncs up on both OS's
[01:41] <BWMerlin> I only really want to access saved configurations so I can copy them to lubuntu
[01:41] <BWMerlin> at this stage all going well I won't need to use Windows
[01:43] <holstein> im just suggesting ways you can access said data.. configs or whatever.. you drop them in dropbox, or sync them to a USB stick.. or have a friendly partition in common
[02:02] <DJRWolf> Trying to get a Toshiba Satellite U305-S7446 with IntelÂ® PRO/Wireless 3945ABG wifi to connect. Wifi Radar does not get past the acquiring DHCP part. Suggestions?
[02:05] <holstein> i would try connecting to something without encryption to rule out a fat-finger password.. i would try the windows driver via ndisgtk.. i would try another version of the linux kernel which i usually do with live CD's
[02:06] <DJRWolf> ok, will do once I get a chance, thanks
[02:06] <DJRWolf> if anyone ealts has a suggestion before I leave channel, the more ideas the better :)
[02:07] <holstein> other that you making an error connecting, a different driver is really the only option
[02:07] <holstein> other than*
[02:50] <Ro> Hello, I am a musician. Could someone please give me a link or explain to me the advantages and drawbacks of making my audio realtime, and if I do chose to do so, tell me how to do it?
[02:50] <Ro> by the way I have an older computer
[02:51] <holstein> Ro: if you have an internal sound card and an old box, you wont get RT
[02:51] <holstein> you dont need RT anyways likely
[02:52] <holstein> if you do software synths and realtime effects, you need lower latency, otherwise, you dont
[02:52] <holstein> check #ubuntustudio or #opensourcemusicians
[02:52] <jude0> hi Ro
[02:52] <holstein> AVlinux is a great live audio distro as well
[02:53] <holstein> Ro: there is a lowlatency kernel in the default repos, that you can use with lubuntu
[02:53] <Ro> uhm, I am going to use a softsynth through wine
[02:53] <jude0> which softsynth out of curiosity
[02:54] <Ro> abox2, it is a really really awesome modular synth that I want to run inside jack
[02:54] <Ro> would you by any chance know how to do that?
[02:54] <jude0> jack always infuriated me
[02:54] <Ro> or should I go to one of those channels?
[02:54] <Ro> I need to learn how to use it. I demand complete moduability with my musical component
[02:55] <holstein> Ro: you should just use the code native in windows
[02:55] <holstein> i use JACK regularly
[02:55] <Ro> holstein, how do you mean? Sorry I am not that familiar with jack
[02:55] <jude0> Ro: did you get all your driver issues figured out?
[02:55] <Ro> jude0, Yes I did. I just took the goddamn thing out, and now I have no problems; sailing on the onboard video
[02:56] <jude0> ha thats one solution
[02:56] <Ro> I think I have had a problem with it before back when my hard disk drive got smashed and I had only a livecd to run on
[02:57] <holstein> Ro: try and watch the language in the official support channels
[02:58] <holstein> Ro: http://jackaudio.org/
[02:58] <holstein> Ro: thats what i use with my firewire device
[02:58] <Ro> Yes, jack. I want to learn how to use it. I want to be able to connect every program I use to its own audio port so I can use it in abox
[02:58] <holstein> http://holstein.bandcamp.com/ was made with ubuntu and FOSS
[02:59] <Ro> so I can route it in abox*
[02:59] <Ro> Awesome, music :D
[02:59] <holstein> if you want to use windows software, i would use windows
[02:59] <jude0> i personally prefer just to midi pipe everything out to a hardware synth
[02:59] <holstein> JACK can route to hardware or software.. or both
[03:00] <Ro> Yes but I want to use windows and linux software together. I really want to try rosegarden and my next main daw, and I am really intrigued by all the standalone synths avalible for linux
[03:00] <holstein> Ro: RG is not great as a DAW
[03:00] <Ro> abox is the only one I need, and it is really extremely light
[03:00] <holstein> ardour3 is about to release and is in beta
[03:01] <holstein> most folks use qtractor or rosegarden with ardour2 now
[03:01] <holstein> and connect via JACK
[03:01] <holstein> JACK is the key
[03:01] <holstein> and decent hardware
[03:01] <holstein> Ro: i wouldnt expect to have much luck with wine and lowlatency
[03:01] <Ro> could I install asio on wine?
[03:02] <holstein> Ro: there is a project my friend runs called KXstudio #kxstudio http://kxstudio.sourceforge.net/
[03:02] <holstein> Ro: he runs PPA's for ubuntu that can be used with any of the variants and tries to support supportable windows vst's
[03:02] <holstein> Ro: you can do what you like
[03:02] <holstein> Ro: im just telling you out of experience not to expect much
[03:03] <holstein> Ro: if you want to use windows software, use windows
[03:03] <holstein> can you get software to do what you want in linux? sure
[03:04] <Ro> then can you point me to a standalone modular synth that works well with jack, and is very powerful?
[03:04] <holstein> if i were you, i would download either ubuntustudio or avlinux and try them live
[03:04] <holstein> you can test JACK and all the software there and not change your computer
[03:04] <Ro> I do not have a DVD drive to use DVDs with
[03:04] <holstein> Ro: *everything* works well with jack
[03:05] <holstein> Ro: you cn boot with a USB
[03:05] <holstein> Ro: you dont have to take my suggestion... you can just install the ubunstudio software in lubuntu
[03:05] <holstein> Ro: you can open the package manager of your choise and search 'ubuntustudio' and install the things that dont deal with the theme
[03:05] <Ro> Hmmmm
[03:06] <holstein> then you can run the software in lxde.. you can install the lowlwatency kernel as well if you need/want it
[03:06] <Ro> is there ever any problems in linux when it comes to downloading things twice?
[03:06] <Ro> like oh say if I install jack twice by accident
[03:06] <holstein> Ro: thats what package management is about
[03:07] <Ro> cool
[03:07] <holstein> Ro: you cant have 2 things installed like that
[03:07] <holstein> i mean, you can, but you wont
[03:07] <Ro> so I shouldn't worry?
[03:07] <jude0> Ro, remember synaptic, start with that
[03:07] <Ro> right
[03:07] <holstein> http://wootangent.net/category/linux/ is my friend [lsd] in #opensourcemusicians who uses ubuntu for music creation.. as well as external synths as jude0 suggested
[03:08] <holstein> http://pneuman.bandcamp.com/
[03:08] <holstein> i dont do a lot of electronic music, but my friends do
[03:08] <Ro> I see, by the way I couldn't get your bandcamp to load, got a soundcloud or something?
[03:09] <holstein> i dont use soundcloud for that.. i use it for students mostly
[03:09] <Ro> you teach?
[03:10] <holstein> Ro: some.. i only have a few students right now
[03:10] <Ro> I see, very neat
[03:11] <Ro> what do you teach?
[03:11] <holstein> http://www.artofliferecords.com/open.html
[03:11] <holstein> Ro: bass, guitar... whatever i hae a few vocal students i teach theory and improv
[03:12] <Ro> wow, very cool.
[03:16] <Ro> heh, you have a pretty good sound
[03:17] <holstein> thanks.. we should carry this to the #lubuntu-offtopic or the #opensourcemusicians
[03:19] <Ro> indeed.
[03:19] <Ro> so what channel would be my best bet to try and find a standalone modular synth to my liking?
[03:24] <holstein> Ro: a music related one.. such as the one i suggested
[03:24] <holstein> Ro:  #opensourcemusicians ..you can try the lau one, but we have a lot of traffic in the OSM channel
[03:25] <Ro> thank you for all your help
[03:25] <holstein> Ro: cheers..
[03:25] <Ro> off onto the neverending quest for "that sound"
[03:31] <holstein> Ro: like most things, the journey is the destination
[07:09] <sunny_> Hi :-)
[07:09] <sunny_> I have just installed lubuntu and I have a couple of questions
[07:10] <sunny_> Can I somehow make the icons on my desktop bigger?
[07:10] <sunny_> How can I add the shut down and restart options to the desktop?
[07:11] <sunny_> Is there a way to remove things I don't need from lunching at startup to make the system boot faster?
[07:34] <sunny_> And can I remove the password thing that keeps popping?
[10:14] <ctrlz> Hi, how can i rotate the webcam in skype? I see it upside down. Lubuntu 12.10 x64 on asus u36sd here
[12:11] <tonycoos> \help
[12:11] <tonycoos> aw... wrong way. sorry!
[16:58] <lessshaste> how do I change the default app for word docs from abiword to libreoffice?
[17:10] <zleap> right click and select open with
[17:11] <zleap> then open with again and you get a list of apps in a dialogue box with a tick box at the bottom to set to default
[17:12] <zleap> lessshaste, is that helpful
[17:13] <lessshaste> zleap, so I need to save a word doc once to do that?
[17:13] <lessshaste> zleap, I am trying to get gmail to open word docs with libreoffice
[17:13] <lessshaste> zleap, how do I even open up a file browser? I am a terminal sort of guy :)
[17:14] <zleap> that method changes the default app you open  file with
[17:14] <zleap> i don't want to change things locally but i just rightclicked on a file .odt
[17:14] <lessshaste> ok cool.. so how do I open a file browser?
[17:15] <zleap> well from lxterminal type firefox
[17:16] <lessshaste> you use firefox as a file browser?
[17:17] <holstein> i would just open the document where you want it to be opened
[17:18] <holstein> if its a step of convenience you are looking for, try and notice when it is happeneing and elaborate as to what is happening and what you want to have happen
[17:18] <lessshaste> holstein, I would normally open it by clicking in gmail.. there I have no options and abiword opens
[17:18] <lessshaste> holstein, so I have been advised to save a word file and then right click from a file browser
[17:19] <lessshaste> holstein, I just wnt to know how to open a file browser to do this :)
[17:19] <holstein> lessshaste: i would open it from the menu... or just open a location
[17:20] <lessshaste> holstein, which app in the menu?
[17:20] <holstein> lessshaste: i dont have lubuntu running in front of me, but it should literally say "file browser"
[17:20] <holstein> lessshaste: its pcmanfm AFAIK
[17:20] <inductiveload> lessshaste: accessories->File Manager PcManFM
[17:21] <lessshaste> I think I need to install that
[17:21] <holstein> lessshaste: you can launch it ffrom the terminal too.. pcmanfm in a terminal
[17:21] <holstein> lessshaste: lubuntu ships with a file manager... ships with pcmanfm
[17:21] <lessshaste> nope it';s installed..
[17:21] <lessshaste> hmm
[17:21] <lessshaste> ah found it :)
[17:22] <holstein> you should be able to right click and mess with the defaults
[17:22] <holstein> OR, just navigate to the file you want to open from the software you want to use
[17:22] <lessshaste> thanks
[17:22] <lessshaste> v. helpful
[17:32] <inductiveload> lessshaste: you can bind the filetype to a default application with xdg-mime
[17:33] <lessshaste> thanks.. I am hoping the current method has worked
[17:35] <inductiveload> ok
