[00:44] <derekv> maybe i'll order that standup desk
[01:08] <snap-l> derekv: I ordered a ball chair
[01:08] <snap-l> and a Cherry MX black keyboard.
[01:53] <derekv> cool
[02:49] <rick_h_> grrr, hate when the wife drives in this crap
[02:49] <rick_h_> can't we go back to the old days where I could have just told her to stay home
[03:06] <derekv> what was that brand of desk we were talking about?
[03:06] <derekv> was it geekdesk?
[03:09] <rick_h_> that's what I've got
[03:10] <rick_h_> http://www.geekdesk.com/default.asp?contentID=634 + solid core door for a top
[03:11] <rick_h_> https://picasaweb.google.com/116120911388966791792/NewOffice#5672344860829706690
[03:11] <rick_h_> thuogh a bit different setup now
[03:14] <derekv> why the door frame
[03:14] <derekv> just to save money?
[03:14] <derekv> nice rack ... *snicker*
[04:02] <greg-g> rick_h_: nothing planned
[11:27] <rick_h_> derekv: yea, getting it without a top is cheaper and shipping is a chunk cheaper as well. The door was just $50 so saved some
[13:27] <rick_h_> so we're officially CHC Royal Oak now :/
[13:47] <widox> rick_h_: heh
[13:47] <widox> rick_h_: there is a new Detroit one, but they didn't call it CHC...
[13:47] <widox> but its the same thing
[13:47] <rick_h_> yea, but I guess they're part of it
[13:47] <rick_h_> why I got the email
[13:47] <rick_h_>  There's
[13:47] <rick_h_> > > one being started in downtown Detroit that's meeting next week:
[13:47] <rick_h_> > >
[13:47] <rick_h_> > > http://www.meetup.com/DetCoffeeCode/
[13:48] <widox> yeah- this Thurs
[13:48] <rick_h_> bah sorry, should have cleaned up first
[13:49] <snap-l> Good morning
[13:49] <rick_h_> morning
[13:50] <snap-l> Yay CHC Royal Oak
[13:50] <snap-l> I guess it's time to re-locate to Madison Heights again. ;)
[13:50] <rick_h_> shush
[13:51] <rick_h_> CHC Where-ever-the-#$%#@-rick-sits :P
[13:51] <snap-l> CHC Rick's Ass.
[13:51] <snap-l> I <3 the date command
[13:52] <snap-l> Check this out... give me a sec.
[13:52] <snap-l> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1581617/
[13:53] <rick_h_> ~50 tracks?
[13:53] <snap-l> Yeah, that's around 3 hours of music
[13:54] <snap-l> and (secret revealing time) I scripted picking around 60 tracks randomly in Python. (with artist checking)
[13:56] <snap-l> I still review 'em after it picks 'em, but it's mostly to get a head start on creating a playlist.
[13:57] <snap-l> Doing it manually is a real PITA
[13:57] <rick_h_> gotcha
[13:57] <rick_h_> didn't realize it was 3hrs
[13:57] <snap-l> Yeah, that's on Metal Injection.fm
[13:58] <snap-l> Funny enough, the guy who put together their radio station put the code for handling the shows on github
[13:59] <snap-l> which helped me debug a problem with the ISO Week numbers he was using.
[14:06] <rick_h_> lmao https://twitter.com/YOLO_YODA/status/295725404264738816/photo/1
[14:18] <snap-l> OK, outside of using CTRL-W to delete a word back (which I use reflexively) what other keypresses will allow you to delete the previous word?
[14:18] <snap-l> or better still, what do you guys use to do mass deletes like that? :)
[14:25] <rick_h_> dd
[14:25] <rick_h_> 0dfX
[14:26] <rick_h_> where X is some character I want to delete up until
[14:26] <rick_h_> then there's di( di" and di'
[14:34] <snap-l> Hm. I now CTRL-U will delete the line while you're editing.
[14:46] <jrwren> snap-l: you should do a metal room on turntable.fm :p
[14:46] <snap-l> jrwren: Have they removed that dippy requirement to have a Facebook account?
[14:47] <jrwren> yes
[14:47] <jrwren> you can just register with them, no FB or twitter needed
[14:50] <snap-l> jrwren: Hm, might check them out again
[15:06] <jrwren> we have a nice industrial room
[15:06] <jrwren> http://turntable.fm/the_oontz_room_ebmelectroindustrialsynthpop
[15:11] <widox> rick_h_: haha. thats great
[16:30] <brousch> greg-g: You there?
[16:40] <rick_h_> he's hiding
[16:42] <brousch> No. He's dying
[16:42] <brousch> Bad soy burger or something
[16:42] <brousch> I make light of it, but he's not feeling well
[17:38] <greg-g> brousch: :P I'm out on a short/slow walk in fresh air, stopped at a coffee shop. Still not feeling well, but didn't want to walk all the way back home yet :/
[17:38] <greg-g> carrie made some awesome seafood dish last night, apparently I ate a bad oyster or something :/
[17:39] <rick_h_> :(
[17:40] <rick_h_> greg-g: asked about MI because I"m selling off a batch of my starter hand tools :P
[17:41] <greg-g> oh no!
[17:41] <rick_h_> want to see you carry on with a hand plane in the pocket lol
[17:41] <greg-g> hah
[17:41] <greg-g> yeah, lets see.......
[18:11] <snap-l> Man, I wish Canonical stocked these: http://www.keyboardco.com/keyboard_details.asp?PRODUCT=862
[18:13] <rick_h_> lol, now he's customizing the keyboard
[18:13] <rick_h_> down the rabbit hole!
[18:13] <greg-g> rick_h_: you might like this blog, or maybe not, it is "ecovillage" focused (he lives at one I visited when I was in undergrad), but awesome photos and work: http://www.small-scale.net/yearofmud/2013/01/28/timber-frame-joinery-how-to-cut-a-tenon/#.UQa_nuDU9E4
[18:14] <rick_h_> greg-g: cool
[18:14] <snap-l> rick_h_: Yeah yeah yeah
[18:14] <brousch> greg-g: Good luck
[18:15] <snap-l> greg-g: Hope you feel better soon
[18:15] <brousch> greg-g: Would you mind sending your slides? I think Dave Brondsema is going to pad his talk with some license stuff
[18:15] <greg-g> brousch: so, uh
[18:15] <greg-g> that was the plan for this morning, originally (things got in the way last week :/ )
[18:15] <brousch> Let me guess. Your slides are under a proprietary license!
[18:16] <rick_h_> under a DNC license :P
[18:16] <brousch> Ah, OK
[18:16] <greg-g> I can send you something I did before at a similar (but longer) talk
[18:16] <brousch> I think we can get by without them
[18:17] <snap-l> They're under a kickinnutz license
[18:17] <snap-l> you can share them, but greg-g reserves teh right to kick you in the nuts.
[18:17] <brousch> Isn't that always the case?
[18:18] <snap-l> brousch: You read the license agreement, didn't you?
[18:18] <snap-l> It's part of browsing my site.
[18:18] <greg-g> http://www.slideshare.net/greg.g/creative-commons-floss-mug
[18:19] <snap-l> Hah! We got it first!
[18:19] <greg-g> :)
[18:19] <snap-l> and I did a video of it too.
[18:19] <snap-l> East side RUUUUUUULES
[18:19] <greg-g> they're woefully out of date (any numbers are probably wrong) but yeah
[18:19] <snap-l> GR always gets things later than the east siders. ;)
[18:20] <snap-l> except great restaurants, decent bandwith, goodwill toward men
[18:20] <greg-g> and awesome beer
[18:20] <brousch> heh
[18:20] <snap-l> having to lock my door at night and sleep with one eye open vs waiting a week for the latest hollywood blockbuster = totally worth it
[18:20] <greg-g> so really, you win ;)
[18:21]  * snap-l wonders what it would take to get a giant Amway building over on this side of the state. ;)
[18:22] <brousch> Well Atomic Object opened up there
[18:23] <brousch> That's one of our best dev shops
[18:39] <snap-l> jrwren: OOP is totally dead. :)
[18:40] <jrwren> ;]
[18:52] <greg-g> rick_h_: also, related, not sure if I've shared http://freecabinporn.com/ with you before (I love the domain name)
[18:53] <greg-g> ok, starting to hit my "in public" limit, time to mosy back home to a warm bed
[18:53] <rick_h_> hah, thanks for the linkage
[18:54] <greg-g> it is part of my daily mental health rss subscription :)
[18:54] <brousch> I'm afraid to look
[19:10] <rick_h_> just for jcastro http://theoatmeal.com/blog/dinosaur_hotel
[19:10] <rick_h_> jcastro: for the next anniversary :P
[19:14] <jcastro> hah awesome
[20:12] <derekv> that feeling when you open a git repo by a group of windows using non developers,
[20:13] <derekv> Now how to fix this without any risk of screwing someone up
[20:13] <derekv> Transperently
[20:13] <derekv> eg mixed line ending encodings
[20:30] <snap-l> derekv: You don't.
[20:30] <snap-l> Just take them out back and beat them over the head with a club.
[20:31] <snap-l> It's easier that way.
[20:31] <snap-l> I'm only half kidding
[20:31] <snap-l> You'll probably need something more than a club.
[22:33] <snap-l> Man, not another Rails exploit
[22:33] <snap-l> it's going to be like Java soon.
