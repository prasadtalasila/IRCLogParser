[16:03] <MichaelP> On my netbook i have 23 inch HD tv hooked up to hdmi... How do i make grub and plymounth boot show on both screens like it does on the livecd ?
[16:08] <BluesKaj> MichaelP, look in system settings> Display&Monitor>Size &Orientation, check unify ouputs , apply
=== spawn[57 is now known as spawn[dead]
=== pjoe_dj is now known as pjoe_afk
[16:23] <MichaelP> BluesKaj, thanks
[16:25] <BluesKaj> MichaelP, np , it worked for me with vga . I'm assuming hdmi isn't much differnt
[16:25] <MichaelP> Now see if that works
[16:25] <3JTAAHPT8> hi giuys , I cannot really understand the policy behind the release new versions of Amarok , I mean I love Amarok , and I had a lot of crashs problem last month, so I'm waiting for some upgrade hoping they will fix the problem , but now the upgrade is there...., and to ipgrade it I'll need to add a backport repository which of course can drive my system to a an unconfortable instability , so I'm just asking , is really the best way we have to spread the
[16:25] <3JTAAHPT8>  improvement of Amarok ?
[16:25] <MichaelP> BluesKaj, that put grub and plymouth on both screens
[16:26] <hateball> 3JTAAHPT8: You can wait for the next release that has the latest version included
=== paolo_ is now known as faLUCE
[16:27] <BluesKaj> MichaelP, isn't that what you want ?
[16:27] <MichaelP> yep
[16:27] <MichaelP> reboot and see what it does
[16:27] <3JTAAHPT8> yeah , of course but for now , if I want music , I just need to use something else, and who knows , maybe , I never come back to amarok , even if is a great software , but it has a bit of pbroblem yet .....
[16:28] <MichaelP> VLC
[16:30] <BluesKaj> 3JTAAHPT8, amarok can work well, but it needs patience and a lot of attention , something for which i don't have time
[16:30] <MichaelP> vlc does both video and music... i use it in both linux and windows
[16:30] <3JTAAHPT8> I think hateball would be much better to use a separate repos just for Amarok , or other software which needs to grow up at different rhythm, to reach the same level of stability of the entire kde ...., anyway , is just my opinion , and probablly there are many reasons to do in the actual way...
[16:31] <BluesKaj> yeah , VLC is my fav media player ... does everything
[16:31] <hateball> Sure, except manage a library and other such things some users might need
[16:32] <BluesKaj> libraries are a PITA to me I just play the files from the folder
[16:33] <lordievader> 3JTAAHPT8: You could try Clementine, it's a fork of Amarok 1.4
[16:33] <3JTAAHPT8> yeah of course BluesKaj, but I fill much more confortable with amarok , when we are talking about thousands and thousands of tracks , to mange , to give it a valuation, to bild a temporany playlist just with a string search , and much more thing that is not really the same in vlc , you don't thing so  ?
[16:33] <BluesKaj> altho clementine is easier to use than amarok
[16:33] <hateball> Different users, different use cases
[16:33] <3JTAAHPT8> lordievader: I'm actually using it , and is a nice software , but I hate to loose any semantic data I put in amarok before ......
[16:34] <BluesKaj> 3JTAAHPT8, I don't open vlc to play the file , I have vlc setup to play all media file extensions
[16:35] <BluesKaj> so I just play the files from the folders directly
=== aswin is now known as zero_coder
[16:36] <3JTAAHPT8> Like I said , I think that there are few software in kde which needs to run a bit faster for a while to reach the same levels of the other , and in my opinion they should be spread in a searate way until they reach the same stability ....., especially if you use those software like default program to do something ...
[16:39] <3JTAAHPT8> I mean guys , when I open Kubuntu for the first time, the default confing , doesn't give any real example that can show the real powerfull of kde ......, I open a web page and it will open rekonq , which is an half software in my opinion (it doesn't support some basic stuff in my opinion), I open Amarok to play some song , and often happens a crash if you play a bit more with it ...., the default player is Dragon Player , someone has really never use it
[16:39] <3JTAAHPT8>  !?!
[16:41] <3JTAAHPT8> I mean, I thing that changing a bit of things can improves a lot the first experience of a newbbie just arrived on kubuntu.......
[16:41] <BluesKaj> well rekonq is not ready for prime time altho it is getting better ...i've never used the default media apps on any OS
[16:42] <BluesKaj> or browsers
[16:42] <3JTAAHPT8> ok BluesKaj I agree, is not ready yet , so why use it us a default software ......
[16:43] <3JTAAHPT8> I mean we aren't talking about a quite useless application, we are talking about the default tool to access the web .......
[16:43] <BluesKaj> 3JTAAHPT8, I beleive the internet section in the kmenu has the firefox installer in the list by default
[16:43] <3JTAAHPT8> we are sure there aren't other better solution m before rekonq is ready ?
[16:43] <3JTAAHPT8> yeah but the installer ....
[16:44] <BluesKaj> well, just run it
[16:44] <3JTAAHPT8> why don't put firefo by default or chromium , and just gives the possibility to try even rekonq ......
[16:44] <BluesKaj> how many ppl in W7 or 8 use IE
[16:45] <zero_coder> people are still using windows :P
[16:45] <3JTAAHPT8> ahh ok , so we have to do the same as windows , of course .....
[16:45] <3JTAAHPT8> yah , but they try to change because they don't like it anymore , don't you think ?
[16:47] <3JTAAHPT8> anyway , mine was just a suggestion, and actually I'm using kubuntu since 5 years about, and I love it .......
[16:48] <lordievader> No one is ever going to agree on what should be the default browser, different person, different browser. Be glad you got apt-get to install your browser of choice.
[16:48] <3JTAAHPT8> and is because I love it , I would like that people that comes to try kubuntu should remain really satisfied, even at the first impression ......
[16:49] <hateball> 3JTAAHPT8: You could perhaps ask on the mailing list
[16:49] <hateball> I agree, having *good* default is something to strive for, just saying "you can install something else, the default is not so good" is hardly the best way to remedy the problem
[16:50] <3JTAAHPT8> hateball: I don't have to ask nothing at moment, like I said I'm using Kubuntu in my work since years , and I don't have anymore those kind  of difficulty........
[16:51] <hateball> 3JTAAHPT8: Well you don't, but as you said new users might
[16:51] <hateball> I'm not sure if  there's any better place than the mailing list to post such suggestions
[16:51] <3JTAAHPT8> that's why I think, the first start of kubuntu , shoulb really ready for a newbbie ......
[16:52] <3JTAAHPT8> for us wouldn't be a problem to setting up owr environment around owr needs ...., for them is just impossible even to image that is possible ......
[16:57] <3JTAAHPT8> about the installer of firefox  BluesKaj , I can image their face when after hours of installation in some case, they start the system , search a browser , and what they found a software not ready yet , or another installation ....., most of them get confused about that I guess .....
[16:57] <lordievader> 3JTAAHPT8: For Windows it is the same?
[16:58] <3JTAAHPT8> yeah , and that's why shouldn't be the same on Kubuntu
[16:58] <3JTAAHPT8> actually it should be the MAIN reason to do it .. :D
[17:03] <3JTAAHPT8> and talking about rekonq , have it as a default software means , to have it as a default browser when open links from apps like thunderbird, even if I change any settings I know about it, and being rekonq a software not ready yet , it should be avoided I guess .....

[17:55] <BluesKaj> 3JTAAHPT8, anyone with some computer experience shouldn't have a problem with installing Firefox , especially if he/she has the ability to install linux in the first place :)
[17:56] <3JTAAHPT8> of course BluesKaj, maybe some of them ae even capable to compile it , why we don't point them just to the source  :D , of course I'm jocking  .....
[17:56] <youquex> anyone use chromium?
[17:57] <3JTAAHPT8> I do youquex, and I love it ...
[17:57] <youquex> ivew noticed, whjat I think is a minor difference compared to chrome
[17:57] <youquex> when you dont have any tabs, there is no new tab button
[17:57] <youquex> so you gotta go to the menu, and open one, then you get the tab
[17:57] <3JTAAHPT8> yeah , I saw it ......
[17:57] <youquex> kinda annoying
[17:57] <youquex> is it a chromium thing
[17:57] <3JTAAHPT8> or just use CTRL + T youquex
[17:58] <youquex> oh i know
[17:58] <youquex> ive been using linux for n12+ years, im very good with shortcuts
[17:58] <youquex> im just curious if its a linux thing with chromium AND chrome, or its just chromium, and would be see the same on windows
[17:59] <youquex> its just a minor annoyance cause im so used to hitting the new tab button and typing an address
[17:59] <3JTAAHPT8> maybe some #chromium channel here !?!
[18:00] <youquex> googling doesnt give much a clue, just lots of complaints of people bitching about them removing the + sign from the new tab button
[18:00] <youquex> eh maybe, ive been on freenode for years, lemme loook
[18:02] <3JTAAHPT8> yeah youquex is there a #chromium channel on freenode, maybe they can tell us ... :)
[18:02] <youquex> ya i know
[18:02] <youquex> i just asked
[18:02] <youquex> no answerszz yet
[18:03] <youquex> lol
[18:03] <youquex> they want me to ask in chromium support
[18:04] <3JTAAHPT8> yeah , I see , I'm there
[18:06] <youquex> 3JTAAHPT8: well they are saying its a ubuntu build thing
[18:06] <youquex> they built it with weird options or something
[18:07] <youquex> or its an old version
[18:07] <youquex> but its 23.x which is only one version down from the current stable
[18:07] <3JTAAHPT8>  about the suggestion to improve the default config of  kubuntu,  do you think is this http://www.kubuntuforums.net/forumdisplay.php?165-Round-Table-Discussions-Moderated the right place to talk about it, I mean talk to the council of Kubuntu !?! , should I dare to ? , because I didn't find any better place to do it ......
[18:13] <BluesKaj> chromium doesn't integrate it's tab fonts well with kde ..so small that they're unreadable on a large monitor, the gtk settings don't do much either
[18:13] <tsimpson> 3JTAAHPT8: the best place to do it is either on the kubuntu-devel mailing list, or report a bug on launchpad
[18:13] <3JTAAHPT8> report bug to prupose an improvement of default settings !?! I'm confused !?!
[18:14] <tsimpson> yes
[18:14] <3JTAAHPT8> I would like to open a discussion on it and not report a bug actually .....
[18:15] <tsimpson> then use the mailing list
[18:15] <tsimpson> https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/kubuntu-devel
[18:21] <3JTAAHPT8> ok tsimpson, but once I'm in where should I write it !? :O
[18:21] <tsimpson> 3JTAAHPT8: you write an email to the address shown
[18:22] <tsimpson> it'll get sent to all subscribers to the list, including the council and and development team
[18:23] <3JTAAHPT8> ok tsimpson, i'll do it , thanks ...
