[00:01] <zoom> ok, 32 bit behaves exactly the same. so it must be something version unrelated with this laptop

[02:20] <Petros> Hi ther. Couple hours ago I had problems with uncontrolled session shut down (after a power cut). As I cleared my .Config it is ok now (thank you guys). It appears, the crashed app is skype. I removed .skype dir and reinstalled skype using software centre - no success. Skype support forum yields no answer. Please advise.
[02:26] <Unit193> Petros: Try fully purging the application >  sudo apt-get purge skype skype-bin   then reinstall  with  sudo apt-get install skype-bin
[02:33] <Petros> Unit193: executing...
[02:34] <Fudge> anyone happen to have a script to get all depends to prepare for installing xfce from git
[02:36] <Petros> Unit193: same effect - just relogged after a crash

[11:02] <qwertz_> any estimates on which xfce will make it into 13.04?
[11:03] <qwertz_> oh actually i see 4.12 pre1 has been released!
[11:04] <qwertz_> damnit, that was 4.10 pre1 :(
[11:05] <koegs> qwertz_: 4.10 is final
[11:05] <koegs> and 4.10 is in 12.10
[11:06] <qwertz_> okay, so the devs have explicitly decided against 4.12 in 13.04?
[11:08] <Unit193> qwertz_: It won't be released in time.
[11:09] <qwertz_> Unit193, that's a pity...
[11:09] <qwertz_> i thought this time they targeted a xubuntu-friendly release-schedule...
[11:10] <knome> that's not their main goal
[11:25] <dydzEz2_> i got a new ultrabook, is xubuntu a really easy install, basically i just shrink my current w8 OS (I use for games and office and some other software) and use that new space for xubuntu in the gui installation?
[11:25] <dydzEz2_> i have questions about updates, using grub. When a new version comes out, like 13.xx -- how do you upgrade from 12 to 13
[11:25] <dydzEz2_> will you be able to do it within the OS
[11:26] <knome> dydzEz2_, the installation should go that smoothly
[11:27] <knome> dydzEz2_, upgrades from releases to others are easy, and yes, you'll definitely be able to do it within the OS
[11:27] <dydzEz2_> ok thanks
[11:27] <dydzEz2_> i guess ill just secure my wireless driver for linux
[11:28] <knome> making backups of what you have before installing is never a bad idea
[11:29] <dydzEz2_> knome do you recommened unetbootin?
[11:29] <dydzEz2_> yeah of course
[11:29] <knome> i haven't used it myself
[11:29] <knome> if you download the ISO, you can use the live CD to see if your hardware works out of the box
[11:30] <knome> (there are also ways to make a bootable usb stick out of the ISO, if you don't have an optical drive)
[11:31] <dydzEz2_> yeah
[11:31] <dydzEz2_> i have to use a usb stick
[11:31] <dydzEz2_> i got a x1 carbon ultrabook from lenovo
[11:32] <koegs> got the same :)
[11:32] <dydzEz2_> i know theres like 2-3 good usb installers like unetbootin and universal usb installer or something
[11:32] <dydzEz2_> oh yeah?
[11:32] <koegs> works like a breeze
[11:32] <knome> !usb | dydzEz2_
[11:32] <ubottu> dydzEz2_: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[11:32] <dydzEz2_> isnt it such a nice feeel
[11:32] <dydzEz2_> did everything work out of the box?
[11:33] <koegs> dydzEz2_: yes
[11:33] <koegs> i use 12.10, but i think 12.04 LTS should work also
[11:33] <dydzEz2_> thats great
[11:33] <dydzEz2_> imma do updates then make a w8 backup then do this
[11:33] <dydzEz2_> i guess ill use lenovos backup tool
[11:34] <dydzEz2_> thanks for the advice
[11:34] <knome> dydzEz2_, good luck and have fun :)
[11:59] <dydzEz2_> knome, one more thing, do you think I should go 64 bit
[12:00] <dydzEz2_> since we have the same laptop, i know you'd be very helpful in this answer
[12:01] <knome> dydzEz2_, it was koegs who had the same laptop :)
[12:01] <dydzEz2_> oh lol
[12:01] <dydzEz2_> koegs!
[12:02] <dydzEz2_> 64 bit or 32 bit
[12:02] <koegs> i use 64bit on every OS as long as the CPU supports it
[12:02] <dydzEz2_> alright 64 bit xubuntu it is
[12:13] <dydzEz2_> is there really any reason not to get 12.10?
[12:14] <CHIex> Hello, I am new to Linux, looking for distribution. Could you give some tips which would be good for a new user?
[12:14] <knome> dydzEz2_, if you want longer support
[12:14] <CHIex> what is the difference between XUBUNTU and UBUNTU?
[12:14] <knome> CHIex, xubuntu would suit you well, for example
[12:14] <CHIex> knome: WHY?
[12:14] <dydzEz2_> knome: wont i eventually just able to do just upgrade to the newer version anyway
[12:15] <knome> dydzEz2_, yes, but if you go with 12.10, you'll have to upgrade all the releases between
[12:15] <knome> dydzEz2_, from 12.04 you can jump straight to 14.04
[12:15] <dydzEz2_> oh
[12:15] <dydzEz2_> so going with 12.10 just takes more downloading time
[12:15] <knome> CHIex, the main difference is that xubuntu uses xfce as the desktop environment, ubuntu uses unity
[12:16] <knome> dydzEz2_, well, not *right now* :)
[12:16] <knome> dydzEz2_, 14.04 is released in april 2014...
[12:17] <dydzEz2_> yeah
[12:17] <dydzEz2_> im fine with just getting  12.10 if it lets me have the drivers
[12:17] <dydzEz2_> ill do live cd tests
[12:17] <CHIex> so if something goes wrong or I dont know, I could ask in UBUNTU forums? They seem to have larger support so that might be useful sometime
[12:17] <knome> CHIex, some of the questions are xubuntu-specific, but many are not
[12:17] <dydzEz2_> btw when i can dl 12.04, theres an "alternate" link -- whats that for
[12:17] <knome> CHIex, so yes, in many cases, you can
[12:18] <knome> dydzEz2_, that's the non-graphical installation with a few extra installation options
[12:18] <dydzEz2_> oh
[12:18] <knome> dydzEz2_, you'll need desktop if you want to do live cd tests
[12:18] <CHIex> so what are CONS and PROS of Xubuntu?
[12:19] <knome> CHIex, compared to what?
[12:22] <CHIex> to UBUNTU, SUSE and MINT
[12:23] <dydzEz2_> oh knome, so these links at getxubuntu are just pure installation
[12:23] <knome> CHIex, can you please not shout (eg. not write in CAPS)?
[12:23] <knome> CHIex, xubuntu is lighter than ubuntu.
[12:24] <knome> CHIex, the difference between xubuntu and suse/mint are more notable, what's the best depends on your needs
[12:24] <CHIex> pardon about that
[12:24] <knome> dydzEz2_, hmm, which ones?
[12:25] <dydzEz2_> http://xubuntu.org/getxubuntu/
[12:25] <knome> dydzEz2_, both desktop and alternate will install the same system (unless you use one of the extra options with alternate)
[12:25] <CHIex> well I want stuff to be easy, installing without problem, good support, for older computer, for watching videos, support for software and drivers
[12:25] <knome> dydzEz2_, for 12.10, there's only desktop ISO's
[12:25] <dydzEz2_> yeah i downloaded destkop
[12:25] <dydzEz2_> yeah
[12:25] <dydzEz2_> ok so im good
[12:25] <dydzEz2_> ill be able to test the live CD
[12:26] <dydzEz2_> ill just use unetbootin or whatever from
[12:26] <dydzEz2_> !usb
[12:26] <ubottu> For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[12:26] <knome> CHIex, define "older computer"? how much ram do you have?
[12:26] <knome> dydzEz2_, yup, good luck :)
[12:26] <CHIex> I dont know, I havent bought it yet
[12:26] <CHIex> I would also use it for downloading podcasts, sometimes for more days in a row
[12:26] <knome> CHIex, if you have 512MB or less, you might want to look at other alternatives such as lubuntu or even more lightweight ones
[12:27] <CHIex> no, I will have much more RAM
[12:27] <knome> CHIex, in that case, xubuntu should work well for you
[12:28] <CHIex> the same software and drivers that work on UBUNTU work on XUBUNTU too?
[12:28] <knome> CHIex, yes, since they share the same core
[12:29] <knome> CHIex, you can see if everything works before installing with a live cd
[12:29] <CHIex> what about installing? would it be difficult or would I need to do command line stuff sometimes?
[12:29] <CHIex> what is the same as in Ubuntu and what is not? What is the difference?
[12:29] <knome> CHIex, command line is optional for the vast majority of basic tasks
[12:30] <knome> CHIex, as i said, xubuntu uses xfce while ubuntu uses unity (they look and feel different)
[12:30] <knome> CHIex, xubuntu also has a different set of default applications, though everything that is available in ubuntu is also available in xubuntu (and the other way around, naturally)
[12:31] <dydzEz2_> perfect, checksums are valid
[12:31] <dydzEz2_> im good to go after i backup and update windows
[12:46] <knome> ok, i need to get some fresh air (and take out the garbage)
[12:46] <knome> will be back later
[13:56] <MoL0ToV> hi to all! i attached 2 monitor on my graphics board. now i see same thing on both display. howto set the extend, not cloned mode?
[13:59] <koegs> MoL0ToV: which gpu/graphics card?
[14:00] <MoL0ToV> an ati
[14:00] <MoL0ToV> ATI RV515 [Radeon X1300]
[14:01] <ochosi> MoL0ToV: you can either use xrandr (commandline), install arandr (GUI) or add a PPA to get the new xfce-display dialog that'll enable you to use the socalled "extended desktop mode"
[14:02] <ochosi> or if you use proprietary ATI drivers you'll get the ATI display-dialog, with which you can do that as well
[14:02] <MoL0ToV> no free

[14:13] <freedomrun> xfce session random restarting problem ..
[14:14] <dydzEz2_> a question about using lil usb creator, what does setting up a persistence mean
[14:14] <dydzEz2_> what benefits does it have
[14:14] <dydzEz2_> i set the whole drive to persistence
[14:15] <dydzEz2_> does this mean  i can use it as a live cd and also install it onto my internal hard drive
[14:16] <dydzEz2_> oh
[14:16] <dydzEz2_> it just lets me make changes
[14:16] <dydzEz2_> but the install file should still be there
[14:30] <finite9> I installed xfce4 on my Ubuntu 12.10 server to get a basic desktop, but it seems to be a vanilla xfce.  What major components do I need to install to get it roughly similar to what Xubuntu is?

[14:34] <freedomrun> finite9, ↓
[14:41] <dydzEz2_> got 221GB on my main OS on my x1 carbon ultrabook, how much shoulld i put up for xubuntu
[14:41] <dydzEz2_> imma just have to two OS
[14:41] <dydzEz2_> i mainly need linux for GNU software for LaTeX
[14:53] <recon_lap> dydzEz2_: depends, But i'd suggest 40gb as a reasonable starter size.

[18:57] <holstein> xubuntu865: if one of the volunteers can help, they will.. let me link what i used to install 32bit lightscribe in 64bit ubuntu 12.04
[18:58] <holstein> xubuntu865: it looked a lot like this http://howtoubuntu.org/how-to-install-a-32bit-programme-in-64bit-ubuntu/ ,though i seem to remember it being more automated last time i set it up
[20:24] <daswort> my xubuntu 12.10 doesnt show the printer applet. Is that related to the messaging-menu bug?
[20:32] <EmeraldBot> Hello?
[21:13] <holstein> daswort: what are you looking for?
[21:16] <daswort> holstein: `system-config-printer-applet`, i can start it without errors, but i cant see it anywhere
[21:17] <holstein> daswort: whare are you trying to do?
[21:17] <holstein> what*
[21:18] <daswort> i want the little tray icon, when i use the printer
[21:18] <holstein> daswort: sure... for what?
[21:18] <holstein> daswort: to see what printed or not?
[21:18] <holstein> daswort: to cancel printing?
[21:18] <holstein> whats the goal? what is happening and what do you want to happen?
[21:18] <holstein> daswort: have you tried as a differnt user?
[21:19] <daswort> to access system-config-printer-applet easily
[21:19] <daswort> holstein: no, but i will
[21:20] <holstein> daswort: it doesnt start anything for me, but i dont know that i care, or need it
[21:21] <freedomrun> aaa help help
[21:21] <freedomrun> xfce session randomly restarts
[21:21] <freedomrun> can someone help me diagnose this maybe someone had similar situation?!?
[21:22] <holstein> freedomrun: i suggest trying a another user to remove your user config from the equation.. try and see what triggers it.. stop using any compositors you might have added and test... look for upgrades... purge ppa packages
[21:24] <freedomrun> holstein, thnx but I tried almost all .. could it be lightdm related?
[21:25] <freedomrun> also ia32libs problem .. this is 64bit xubuntu
[21:25] <holstein> freedomrun: then, just finish trying, so that you can say i have tried "all"
[21:26] <holstein> freedomrun: if you have pacakge problems, that could be it.. i usually run "sudo apt-get update" and troubleshoot errors
[21:26] <holstein> freedomrun: running as another user can help determine this.. it can let you know if its a system-wide pacakge related issue, or your config
[21:27] <freedomrun> holstein, thnx I`ll try again as another user
[21:35] <freedomrun> holstein, ok it looks like user related isue I did a switch user and there nothing bad happens .. man can`t find this critical one
[21:41] <holstein> freedomrun: i usually just move everything out of /home and test again, and start putting things back i need, til i find the issue, or i find i dont need the things i moved
[21:43] <freedomrun> holstein, thnx man .. I guess I`ll have to move everything (this is work comp) on a backup and restore after clean install ... will spend cca 4-5h, need to be ready in the morning
[21:43] <holstein> freedomrun: i would just move it out, test as that user, and put things back
[21:44] <freedomrun> 250 GB?
[21:44] <freedomrun> or just config files?
[21:44] <holstein> freedomrun: the issue is, if it *is* your config, and you move/backup your /home, it will still be an issue when you restore your /home after a fresh install
[21:44] <holstein> freedomrun: i would do just the .config files.. not the data..
[21:44] <freedomrun> holstein, ok
[21:45] <freedomrun> holstein, I ment to restore only data after fresh install no configs
[21:45] <holstein> freedomrun: cool.. i only wanted to clarify, so you didnt think you necessarily had to fresh install
[21:45] <freedomrun> I remember some thing pulled in half of stupid gnome3 stuff as a deps
[21:46] <freedomrun> I never wanted that in xfce
[21:46] <freedomrun> but I made an error
[21:52] <xubuntu204> .
