[19:58] <jbicha> ricotz: were you planning to forward your harfbuzz multiarch patch to Debian?
[20:04] <ricotz> jbicha, hi, there is no multiarch patch for harfbuzz, it is multiarched already, but debian introduced the not-multiarched dep to graphite2
[20:05] <ricotz> i just removed the graphite2 dep
[20:07] <jbicha> ah, ok
[21:27] <ricotz> jbicha, btw do you know if it is likely to get an update for automake like 1.12.6?
[21:38] <jbicha> ricotz: do you mean by default or just available?
[21:38] <ricotz> available would be nice already
[21:39] <ricotz> i am using a modified debian package here
[21:39] <ricotz> of 1.12.6
[21:40] <jbicha> we'd probably need to modify it to install automake1.12 instead of just automake
[21:41] <jbicha> you should ask people that deal with foundations stuff about that (maybe #ubuntu-devel)
[21:42] <jbicha> my guess is that it may be too late in the cycle for it by default
[22:06] <ricotz> jbicha, yeah, that is the modification i meant, and probably an update for +1 then
