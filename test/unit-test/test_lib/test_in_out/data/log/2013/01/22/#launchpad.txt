[01:15] <uwe> hello, my account on launchpad has been associated with an email on domain of my former employer, i tried to associate it with my gmail account but i just got both accounts listed but could never use the gmail account to log in! now it seems my password has been hacked (as it got changed in several places) ; but i'm unable to recover my lauchpad account ... is this the correct place to seek help ?
[01:16] <wgrant> uwe: You need to change your email addresses on login.launchpad.net separately.
[01:16] <wgrant> If you can't log in any more, you'll need to file a support request at https://forms.canonical.com/lp-login-support/
[04:24] <shadeslayer> wgrant: I was told that you'd know more about this armhf FTBFS https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-active/+archive/ppa/+build/4222034
[04:26] <wgrant> shadeslayer: I think that one's fixed by a new qemu release.
[04:26] <wgrant> I have an RT open about upgrading it
[04:26] <shadeslayer> oh, okay
[04:26] <shadeslayer> any guesstimates till when that gets deployed?
[04:28] <wgrant> No idea :/
[04:39] <shadeslayer> okay
[04:39] <shadeslayer> wgrant: thanks for the update anyway :)

[09:54] <apw> is it just me, or are none of this years raring milestones available in the milestone selector boxes
[09:54] <apw> czajkowski, ^
[09:55] <apw> ahhh they are in the 'complex' edit version, that'll do
[09:56] <wgrant> apw: I see ubuntu-13.04-feature-freeze etc.
[09:57] <apw> wgrant, yeah i think it must be a local issue, as they are in the slwo interface
[10:26] <mpt> czajkowski, this morning I came across two bugs marked as Fix Committed yesterday by artur bryczek <https://launchpad.net/~arturbryczek>, that weren't actually fixed. I'm guessing that at least some of the bugs referred to in <https://launchpad.net/~arturbryczek/+karma> aren't actually fixed either.
[10:27] <mpt> (The bugs I saw were bug 306708 and bug 1091228.)
[10:27] <ubot5> bug 306708 in Jockey "Ask for reboot when closing jockey" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/306708
[10:27] <ubot5> bug 1091228 in apt (Ubuntu) "No record of which repository a package was installed from" [Medium,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1091228
[10:28] <mpt> czajkowski, is there any way to get a list of the bugs he recently changed?
[10:28] <czajkowski> mpt: where would I be without you :)
[10:28] <czajkowski> mpt: https://bugs.launchpad.net/~arturbryczek
[10:28] <czajkowski> I usually just end up checking if they list isn't that long
[10:30] <mpt> oh, wow, did you just suspend him?
[10:30] <mpt> If so, seeing the state of bug 1084523 I don't blame you :-)
[10:30] <ubot5> Error: Could not gather data from Launchpad for bug #1084523 (https://launchpad.net/bugs/1084523). The error has been logged
[10:31] <czajkowski> mpt: I did
[10:31] <czajkowski> mpt: bugs are not toys
[10:32] <mpt> yeah
[10:32] <mpt> Thank you, I'm cleaning up now
[10:32] <czajkowski> mpt: if you come across people like that just file a question
[10:33] <czajkowski> I do them every day and get a couple of enthuastic community people doing similar
[10:33] <czajkowski> once they contact us for being suspended I point out thats not how bug triaging goes
[10:37] <mpt> czajkowski, a song for you to play while you do that work: http://music.metafilter.com/480
[10:39] <czajkowski> mpt: LOL!

[10:44] <MCR1> but since 3.7 and 3.8 I am having trouble to push data
[10:44] <MCR1> pulling works
[10:44] <czajkowski> mpt: so I get my restart later button back :D
[10:44] <mpt> yep
[10:45] <czajkowski> ah if only all bugs were that simple to fix :)
[10:45] <czajkowski> StevenK: wgrant either of ye about to advise on MCR1 issue ?

[11:06] <mpt> czajkowski, do you have a policy on what to do with the LP accounts of people who've died?
