[14:59] <tseliot> tjaalton: what version and revision of fglrx-updates did you upload in precise-proposed?
[15:02] <tjaalton> tseliot: fglrx-installer-updates (2:9.000-0ubuntu0.4)
[15:02] <tjaalton> didn't touch -updates
[15:02] <tjaalton> since the change was for the backport stack and it doesn't support the video abi?
[15:03] <tseliot> tjaalton: it should work with Quantal's ABI, shouldn't it?
[15:03] <tjaalton> not sure anymore
[15:03] <tjaalton> oh right
[15:04] <tjaalton> it's that package :)
[15:04] <tjaalton> -exp-9 confused me
[15:04] <tjaalton> didn't touch !-updates
[15:05] <tseliot> tjaalton: oh, as I uploaded fglrx-installer-experimental-9 (2:9.010-0ubuntu0.3) on 7 January
[15:06] <tseliot> tjaalton: what did you do in the package?
[15:07] <tjaalton>   * debian/substvars: Drop the versioned dependency on xserver-xorg-core*.
[15:07] <tjaalton>     (LP: #1080588)
[15:07] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 1080588 in jockey (Ubuntu Precise) "jockey suggests not installable packages on renamed stack" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1080588
[15:07] <tjaalton> same on -exp-9
[15:08] <tjaalton> 0.3 was uploaded on Nov 21st..
[15:08] <tjaalton> uh
[15:09] <tjaalton> -exp-9 0.3 was uploaded Dec 7th
[15:09] <tjaalton> those should both be in proposed since some time last week
[15:10] <tjaalton> nope
[15:11] <tjaalton> sru uploads don't seem to get through
[15:11] <mlankhorst> :(
[15:15] <tseliot> tjaalton: but shouldn't it be 9.010 ?
[15:16] <mlankhorst> going to be a mess for a while, I hope I can get the mesa sru done soon
[15:19] <tjaalton> tseliot: I touched those two packages
[15:19] <tjaalton> both at -0u0.4
[15:22] <tseliot> tjaalton: I'm a bit confused. I uploaded these packages on 7 January (both waiting for approval): fglrx-installer-experimental-9 (2:9.010-0ubuntu0.3) precise-proposed , fglrx-installer-updates (2:9.000-0ubuntu0.3) precise-proposed
[15:22] <tseliot> tjaalton: I'm wondering why it didn't reject my uploads
[15:23] <tjaalton> they are both on the queue
[15:27] <tseliot> ok, I need to make further changes...
[15:45] <tjaalton> tseliot: you can find my uploads here https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+queue?queue_state=1&queue_text=
[15:45] <tjaalton> your's too :)
[15:46] <tjaalton> -'
[15:46] <tseliot> tjaalton: excellent, thanks
[15:47] <tjaalton> 0.4 has both of the changes from the new 0.3, cjwatson suggested I should bump the release when I uploaded those
[15:48] <tjaalton> but I dropped the xserver dependency completely
[15:48] <tjaalton> it's redundant
[15:48] <tseliot> tjaalton: not just the versioned dependency?
[15:48] <tjaalton> http://launchpadlibrarian.net/127494692/fglrx-installer-experimental-9_2%3A9.010-0ubuntu0.1_2%3A9.010-0ubuntu0.4.diff.gz
[15:51] <tseliot> tjaalton: do you mind if I ask an admin to reject both mine and your uploads of -updates and -experimental so that I can add the optional dependency on the quantal-lts headers?
[15:53] <tjaalton> sure, and after re-reading the bug, maybe it was unnecessary to drop the dependency..
[15:53] <tjaalton> feel free to reuse 0.4
[15:53] <ogra_> is there already an ETS
[15:53] <ogra_> err
[15:53] <ogra_> is there already an ETA when we wiull switch ABIs ?
[15:54] <tjaalton> no
[15:54] <tjaalton> maybe early feb
[15:54] <ogra_> (the arm world will fall over once that happens)
[15:54] <tjaalton> ish
[15:54] <tjaalton> before feature-freeze most likely
[15:54] <ogra_> hmm, k, we dont have any updated binary drivers for any of the arm images atm 
[15:55] <ogra_> and without unity-2d that means no images without drivers
[15:55] <tjaalton> then fix it ;)
[15:55] <tseliot> tjaalton: ok
[15:55] <ogra_> now ? llvmpipe wont be any solution on arm :P
[15:56] <ogra_> s/now/how/
[15:56] <tjaalton> tseliot: not sure if slangasek only meant the version part of "need to touch this for the next stack"
[15:56] <tjaalton> ogra_: get the cluebat and chase vendors
[15:57] <ogra_> doing that since a while 
[15:57] <tseliot> tjaalton: I think it's fine to do this for the LTS
[15:57] <ogra_> though TI is hard to chase since the whole OMAP team was fired
[15:57] <tjaalton> heh
[15:57] <tjaalton> tseliot: ok
[16:20] <mlankhorst> :(
