[01:48] <cprofitt> balloons: you on?
[01:48] <balloons> cprofitt, you caught me
[01:48]  * balloons is reading
[01:49] <cprofitt> awesome... sorry it is so late
[01:49] <balloons> no worries
[01:49] <cprofitt> so, what does a maintainer do?
[01:49] <balloons> ok, so on the friendly stuff, there was dev team who built checkbox and maintained the site
[01:49]  * cprofitt nods
[01:50] <balloons> now, there is noone to maintain the site
[01:50] <balloons> although, there are folks working on checkbox it seems ;-)
[01:50] <balloons> so, from that perspective, I believe uf is written in.. heck I can't remember
[01:50] <cprofitt> so it would involve maintaining the website?
[01:50] <balloons> but it is a codebase of some sort
[01:50] <balloons> so there would be some development effort, no matter how small or trivial
[01:51] <balloons> you would need to keep the site up, secure hosting, make enhancements and updates, etc
[01:51]  * cprofitt nods
[01:51] <cprofitt> I assume some sort of database backend as well
[01:51] <balloons> sure sure
[01:52] <cprofitt> well... my last real coding was with asp.net and c#
[01:52] <balloons> so, if you were to create a team to help do this, the previous maintainers I believe are willing to help you out
[01:52] <balloons> to the extent possible
[01:52]  * cprofitt nods
[01:52] <balloons> they may or may not be around to help.
[01:53] <balloons> regardless, they are keen to see it continue
[01:53] <cprofitt> I would certainly be willing to attempt it -- would like to get more information on the framework and toolset
[01:53] <cprofitt> I believe ara was one of the key people before...
[01:53] <cprofitt> and I know she would like to see it continue as well.
[01:55] <cprofitt> so what would the next step be?
[01:55] <balloons> yes, ara and I have spoken in the past several times
[01:55] <balloons> and your not the only one who
[01:55] <balloons> s mentioned being interested
[01:56] <balloons> so we should get all of your together :-)
[01:56] <cprofitt> cool... we should get all of us together... I am interested in seeing it succeed and would really like to assist in that effort
[01:56] <balloons> I'll add it to my list to send a mail out to all of you
[01:56] <cprofitt> but being part of a team with someone who has a littl emore experience with the framework would be ideal imho
[01:57] <balloons> yes, not sure what it is
[01:57] <balloons> but I think it should work out fine
[01:57] <cprofitt> cool... I am sure it will work out fine
[01:57] <balloons> I don't think you'd have an issue
[01:57] <balloons> excellent
[01:57] <cprofitt> thanks... I am often cautious
[01:57] <cprofitt> I never want to let others down
[01:58] <cprofitt> thanks, keep me posted balloons
[01:59] <cprofitt> I will try to blog about this as well.
[01:59] <balloons> cprofitt, I think it would be in good hands to have you watching after it :-)
[02:00] <cprofitt> thanks

[20:18] <phillw> Noskcaj: does the server iso work?
[20:18] <Noskcaj> i don't know, never used it
[20:19] <letozaf_> balloons, sorry for yesterday couldn't do much :(
[20:19] <phillw> Noskcaj: could you please try it? It is the next least smallest iso that does not have GUI on and is distro indepenent
[20:20] <letozaf_> balloons, I had a look ad the evince autopilot test you modified, looks good
[20:20] <Noskcaj> ok, i shall download the amd64 version now
[20:21] <Noskcaj> while it downloads, i have some bugs that i need to confirm the fix for
[20:21] <phillw> install it with nothing else added.
[20:21] <phillw> it is CD sized, but any *buntu-desktop can be added to it.
[20:22] <Noskcaj> ok, it's fine for it to be in a VM?
[20:23] <phillw> indeed, but I want to see if it works under testdrive
[20:23] <Noskcaj> ok
[20:23] <Noskcaj> the dpwnload is 13%
[20:23] <Noskcaj> *download
[20:24] <Noskcaj> btw, have a look at how buggy edubuntu is, its ridiculous
[20:24] <balloons> letozaf_, good, I take it it's working then ;-)
[20:24] <letozaf_> balloons, yes
[20:25] <letozaf_> balloons, but  I cannot understand how the improvements made work
[20:25] <letozaf_> balloons, can I use them to improve the other tests ? or the evince one ?
[20:25] <letozaf_> balloons, do I have to wait?
[20:25] <balloons> what do you mean?
[20:26] <balloons> sorry, I got a bit lost in that
[20:26] <letozaf_> balloons, you guys were talking about a tool  "autopilot vis" and an "autopilot launch xxxx"
[20:27] <thomi> FYI, 'autopilot launch' is now packaged in the autopilot PPA
[20:27] <balloons> ahh yes
[20:27] <balloons> well, as thomi said the nice autopilot launch feature is done
[20:28] <letozaf_> thomi, thanks
[20:28] <balloons> it's used for introspection
[20:28] <balloons> so yes.. basically it will allow us to do some of the things we couldn't before
[20:28] <balloons> best to talk in test specifics probably
[20:29] <balloons> but you can see where I started modifying the gedit test
[20:29] <balloons> some of it is checked in
[20:29] <letozaf_> but can I get the autopilot launch from the PPA and start helping ?
[20:30] <Noskcaj> can someone confirm bug 1088054, bug 1087409 and bug 1087848?

[20:37] <balloons> letozaf_, yes you can help
[20:37] <balloons> and yes it's in the ppa now
[20:37] <balloons> so, pick a test where you couldn't do something before
[20:38] <balloons> then, let's talk about using introspection to help
[20:38] <balloons> if you use the autopilot launch evince for instance, you can then run 'autopilot vis' to visualize
[20:39] <balloons> it will show you the dbus session. then you find the data properties you need to look at or assert on, and boom your golden
[20:41] <letozaf_> ok let me have a look
[21:02] <balloons> hmm thomi I don't see an updated version on my box
[21:02] <balloons> I've got the ppa..
[21:02] <balloons> Version: 1.2daily12.12.10-0ubuntu1
[21:03] <thomi> balloons: hmmm, let me check - I was sure it merged yesterday
[21:03] <thomi> balloons: ahhhh
[21:03] <thomi> I think the daily built versions are seen as being newer than the ppa versions maybe? I'll do some asking around
[21:04] <balloons> yes, let me check
[21:05] <balloons> i may have to force
[21:05] <balloons> yes, I see the daily
[21:06] <thomi> balloons: yeah - forcing it would work - just checking with fgintherto see if we can fix the versioning somehow
[21:06] <thomi> hi fginther :)
[21:07] <balloons> argh
[21:07] <balloons> it hates me
[21:07] <balloons> apt lies!
[21:07] <letozaf_> balloons, lol
[21:09] <balloons> ok
[21:09] <balloons> ok, old version is installed.. dist-upgrading, I believe it will pull the new
[21:09] <balloons> yes, pulling from ppa
[21:10] <balloons> ok, so 1.2+bzr100pkg0raring1 is installed, autopilot launch is a no go
[21:10] <balloons> usage: autopilot [-h] {run,list,vis} ...
[21:10] <balloons> autopilot: error: argument mode: invalid choice: 'launch' (choose from 'run', 'list', 'vis')
[21:10] <thomi> balloons: should be +bzr114
[21:11] <thomi> soooo fginther - are we no longer building into the PPA?
[21:11] <balloons> https://launchpad.net/~autopilot/+archive/ppa has 100
[21:12] <fginther> thomi, sorry, I had to relocate to a different room, still trying to gather all the data
[21:12] <thomi> fginther: sure, no worries
[21:13] <balloons> letozaf_, ^^ following this?
[21:13] <letozaf_> balloons, sure
[21:13] <letozaf_> thanks
[21:14] <fginther> hmmm....
[21:18] <fginther> thomi, yuck, the autopilot dputs have been failing for some time due to the package string switch
[21:19] <thomi> haha, well, at least we caught it now :)
[21:19] <fginther> thomi, we should just need to purge the package from the ppa and re-do the last dput
[21:19] <fginther> ... 2 months later :-)
[21:20] <balloons> lol
[21:20] <Noskcaj> phillw, i have the server iso, what did i need to do?
[21:21] <phillw> Noskcaj: see if it will install using testdrive.
[21:21] <Noskcaj> ok
[21:21] <phillw> do not add anything to it when it asks, just leave it basic.
[21:22] <Noskcaj> ok, so just the "default" testcase?
[21:30] <fginther> thomi, balloons, I've dput a new autopilot package, hopefully it will show up soon with the correct version.

=== Noskcaj is now known as Noskcaj_afk
[21:45] <SergioMeneses> btw balloons look http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRER_Uj7h_I
[21:46] <SergioMeneses> I have been reading about autopilot
[21:46] <phillw> balloons: good news :) As testdrive is having problems with mini iso, I asked Jackson to try ubuntu-server iso with no additions, it installs fine. This is as close we can currently get to a mini-iso as you can add ANY of ubuntu family desktop systems to it :D
[21:46] <balloons> SergioMeneses, awesome!
[21:46] <thomi> balloons: new autopilot packages appear to be baked in the PPA now :)
[21:47] <thomi> SergioMeneses: Great work - the only word I can understand is "unity", but it look snice :)
[21:47] <thomi> oh, and "autopilot" I guess
[21:48] <SergioMeneses> thomi, jeje I'll add subtitles next time!
[21:48] <thomi> heh. I keep thinking we ought to do something like this...
[21:48] <thomi> I keep meaning to write a couple of blog posts about autopilot
[21:48] <SergioMeneses> thomi, sounds really good
[21:54] <letozaf_> balloons, thomi I've been trying to update autopilot packages, but up to now cannot get anything, did you try balloons ?
=== Noskcaj_afk is now known as Noskcaj
[21:54] <Noskcaj> phillw, what are the issues with the mini iso?
=== Noskcaj is now known as Noskcaj_afk
[21:57] <balloons> hmm.. it appears you reverted the naming scheme
[21:58] <phillw> Noskcaj: they are dropped in as and when by debian. Ubuntu uses them as a build when it all passes. I'm sure I'm over simplfying this, cjohnston or one of the other guys know this better. But that was the mini-iso for idiots guide that they gave me :)
[21:58] <balloons> yea letozaf_ thomi 1.2daily12.12.10-0ubuntu1+bzr114pkg0raring1 is not > than 1.2+bzr100pkg0raring1
[21:59] <phillw> not cjohnston, cjwatson who is on -release
[22:01] <SergioMeneses> ok guys I have to go out... ill see you soon
[22:02] <fginther> balloons, letozaf_ the version naming scheme for autopilot changed. You'll need to manually remove any already installed packages in order to update to the ppa
[22:02] <phillw> Noskcaj_afk: I'm awaiting to be told off for asking in the wrong channel, but... it won't be the 1st time.
[22:03] <balloons> letozaf_, this will work: sudo apt-get install python-autopilot=1.2daily12.12.10-0ubuntu1+bzr114pkg0raring1
[22:03] <balloons> although, again my concerns about clean upgrades
[22:03] <letozaf_> ok let me try
[22:04] <balloons> fginther, k, ty
[22:04] <balloons> and it works
[22:04] <balloons> excellent
[22:04] <balloons> lol..
[22:04] <balloons> I may have spoke too soon
[22:05] <balloons> anyways, letozaf_ give it a whirl
[22:05] <balloons> when you launch autopilot vis, you'll see a sessoin named 'root'
[22:06] <balloons> select it and you'll get the list of stuff for the app you launched
[22:06] <letozaf_> balloons, yeah!!!! got the upgrade, I will give it a whirl now!!!
