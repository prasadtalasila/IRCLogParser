[01:03] <jcastro> popey: how's the left coast?
[01:04] <popey> cold
[01:04] <popey> enjoyable
[01:04] <jcastro> wat
[01:04] <popey> its freezing here
[01:04] <jcastro> popey: send a friendly, yet trolly message to bacon for me
[01:04] <jcastro> do something like
[01:04] <mhall119> here too, I actually had to turn off the A/C and close the windows
[01:05] <jcastro> "the entire juju source tree got deleted." and "amazon decided to dump ubuntu" or something for me
[01:05] <daker> è_é
[01:06] <popey> hah
[01:06] <popey> he was sat next tome,just left
[01:06] <popey> oh, he's still here
[01:06]  * popey does it
[01:06] <jcastro> yeah!
[01:06] <jcastro> work it!
[01:06] <popey> done
[01:06] <popey> he's gonna call you
[01:07] <mhall119> ah ha
[01:07] <mhall119> jcastro: now ignore it
[01:07] <popey> lol
[01:07] <mhall119> or just tell him you have no idea why popey would say such a thing
[01:07] <jcastro> lol
[01:08] <jcastro> I hope he calls mes
[01:08] <jcastro> "Hey, it's like 8pm here, I am wasted, popey says 'hahah idiot, and go punch him'"
[01:08] <jcastro> popey: hell hath no fury like a horseman with total knowledge of his timezone
[01:15] <popey> he just walkedin.."popey, you're an asshole"
[01:15] <popey> mission accomplished
[01:15] <popey> do we have an accomplishment for that?
[01:16] <jcastro> popey: nice try
[01:16] <jcastro> look, I might not like his choice of music, sometimes ....
[01:16] <jcastro> but you'll never get horseman to horseman violence.
[01:16] <jcastro> hint: try holbach.
[01:20] <mhall119> holbach's just come back from 3 weeks of vacation, nothing's gonna get to him right now
[01:22] <popey> sounds like a challenge
[07:23] <bkerensa> Ahh I really do love Ubuntu's development process its so less chaotic than say linux kernel
[08:01] <dholbach> good morning
[08:04]  * popey hugs dholbach 
[08:04]  * dholbach hugs popey back
[11:18] <czajkowski> dholbach: how was the drive?

[14:11] <jcastro> mhall119: hey, I am reading about the 100 scopes thing
[14:12] <jcastro> and I remembered that the AU lens has a server side daemon too
[14:12] <jcastro> so just FYI
[14:12] <jcastro> it was so if it ever shipped by default it wouldn't pound on their site
[14:15] <mhall119> jcastro: yup, already aware and have a plan

[17:07] <dholbach> JoseAntonioR, I reached out to two folks but both have not gotten back to me yet
[17:07] <JoseAntonioR> hmm, ok
[17:07] <JoseAntonioR> let's just wait then :)
[17:07] <dholbach> JoseAntonioR, maybe for now we'll just put it in the schedule with a TBD as the name
[17:07] <dholbach> I already started writing the announce text

[17:07] <JoseAntonioR> oh, great
[17:08] <dholbach> that'll give us a bit more than a week to spread the news
[17:08] <dholbach> let's make sure that some tech sites pick it up as well so we get a big audience :)

[17:36]  * dholbach hugs you all
[17:36] <dholbach> yeah, I was planning to
[17:37] <dholbach> bye :)
[17:51] <jcastro> jono: I am! Sorry I went to lunch assuming you were sprinting
[17:51] <jcastro> jono: I am free whenever
[17:55] <snap-l> jcastro: jono: http://www1.rollingstone.com/hearitnow/player/anthrax1.html
[17:56] <jcastro> dude
[17:56] <jcastro> this is awesome
[17:57] <snap-l> I was wondering how Joey would handle it when I heard they were doing a cover
[17:57] <snap-l> But they've always been great with their covers.
[17:57] <snap-l> Got the TIme is one of my absolute favorite covers.
[17:58] <snap-l> wanted my band in high school to play it. They said it wasn't metal enough
[17:58] <snap-l> ;)
[17:59] <snap-l> Love the cowbell part too. ;)
[18:03] <jcastro> he does a Dio live cover on the big4 dvd
[18:03] <jcastro> he does not pull it off at all, it's terrible
[18:03] <snap-l> Dio is hard to pull off
[18:03] <snap-l> It's way more operatic than Joey is used to handling
[18:04] <snap-l> gotta sing that one from the gut with a little vibrato
[18:04] <snap-l> and it's way too easy to hit cheese when you're imitating Dio
[18:05] <snap-l> IT's like trying to imitate James LaBrie from Dream Theater.
[18:05] <snap-l> or Jon ANderson
[18:06] <snap-l> I would say Geoff Tate, but I've heard several other singers with that style.
[18:34] <jono> jcastro, will call in a few mins
[18:34] <jono> just wrapping a few things up here
[18:34] <jcastro> no worries
[18:34] <jono> but then I have a call at 11
[18:34] <jcastro> jono: so phone, no G+?
[18:34] <jono> we can have a quicck catch up, and then we can talk on Mon
[18:34] <jono> jcastro, G+
[18:34] <jono> I am back at home
[18:34] <jcastro> I can be fast!
[18:34] <jcastro> oh ok

[23:19] <bkerensa> So I guess there is now a Android app that emulates Ubuntu Phone OS on the Play Store?
[23:19] <bkerensa> wow
[23:20] <daker> bkerensa: link ?
[23:20] <bkerensa> daker: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tsf.shell&hl=en
[23:20] <bkerensa> they have a Ubuntu Phone skin
[23:21] <daker> ah i see
[23:21] <bkerensa> and with UCCW and TCF it looks exactly like everything that was shown in any of the Ubuntu Phone OS videos
[23:22] <bkerensa> daker: here is a video http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=-UaQTuPJ0-A#!
[23:22] <bkerensa> though the mimic of the Unity launcher looks much improved now
[23:23]  * daker looking
[23:27] <daker> bkerensa: nice
[23:28] <bkerensa> daker: yeah but I still think for those who want the Ubuntu experience its better to wait on the image since thats just sitting on top of Android and consuming much battery
[23:28] <bkerensa> I'm not a big fan of using third party shells or launchers on android
[23:28] <daker> bkerensa: i can wait
[23:29] <daker> then i can buy my FIRST smart phone :D
[23:29] <bkerensa> daker: your not going to get a FF Phone?
[23:29] <bkerensa> :P
[23:29] <daker> bkerensa: dual boot hahahaha
[23:33] <popey> the Ubuntu phone OS shell is way more than just a launcher
[23:36] <daker> popey: what do you mean ?
[23:48] <popey> well, people are making things that look like Ubuntu Phone OS
[23:49] <popey> but they don't have the essence of what happens when you do stuff with the OS
[23:49] <popey> it's not just a launcher
[23:50] <daker> popey: yep
[23:51] <jcastro> I'm just looking forward to a non-java performance experience. ")
[23:57] <bkerensa> popey: Is it not all Linux and Open Source when it comes down to it?
[23:57] <bkerensa> with Unity?
