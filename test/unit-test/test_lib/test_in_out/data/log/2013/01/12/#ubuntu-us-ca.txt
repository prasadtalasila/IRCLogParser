[01:34] <bkerensa> pleia2: FreeGeek's shop full of Xubuntu laptops looked great
[01:34] <bkerensa> :D
[01:34] <pleia2> need pictures! :)
[01:35] <bkerensa> pleia2: will upload... btw have you guys talked with them at all? A few people there I talked to did not seem to fully realize that Xubuntu is a part of Ubuntu
[01:35] <pleia2> bkerensa: think you could interview someone there about it? I'm thinking blog post for xubuntu.org
[01:35] <bkerensa> :)
[01:35] <pleia2> I don't think they've ever contacted us
[01:36] <bkerensa> yeah let me ask Vagrant he is on the Technocrats team that decided to move to Xubuntu
[01:36] <pleia2> at least, not as someone from freegeek :)
[01:36] <bkerensa> yeah
[01:36] <pleia2> great

[01:41] <bkerensa> When I go back I will take better photos with my dslr instead of phone
[01:41] <bkerensa> :D
[01:41] <bkerensa> pleia2: I'm thinking I might make the leap to Xubuntu soon and I found a bug while there :D
[01:42] <pleia2> great, interview + flash dslr photos == good blog post for xubuntu.org!

[01:43] <darthrobot> Title: [Ubuntu OS for SmartPhones Features & Layout Demo & Hands-On Experience - YouTube]
[01:44] <grantbow> I saw the shuttleworth intro video, not sure I've seen this one
[01:44] <pleia2> m_anish: yeah, Canonical had demos at CES
[01:45] <m_anish> grantbow, apparently that's ubuntu on the samsung galaxy nexus
[01:45] <m_anish> pleia2, ^
[01:45]  * pleia2 nods
[01:45] <pleia2> that's the image they said will be available for download in a couple months
[01:45] <m_anish> ok
[01:49] <bkerensa> pleia2: so looks like the bug is actually fix :) but their repos must be behind
[01:49] <bkerensa> there was just a bug in the xubuntu-docs startpage to some broken links
[01:49] <bkerensa> :D
[01:49] <pleia2> bkerensa: hooray for fixed bugs
[01:49] <pleia2> oh yeah, we fixed all that up
[01:49] <pleia2> huge docs rewrite for 12.10
[01:50] <pleia2> wanted to SRU some stuff to 12.04, but we've been busy (and don't currently have a formal docs lead...)
[01:51] <grantbow> getting ready to record at dvlug.org :-)
[23:37] <philipballew> kdub, around?
