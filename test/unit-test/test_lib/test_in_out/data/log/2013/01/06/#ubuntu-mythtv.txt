[00:28] <qwebirc80181> I've been reading about this new Lossless Cut app, but the install is a pain and seems to be focused on a Debian install.  Does mythbuntu plan on incorporating this?

[11:20] <Igramul> hi, after getting stuck with my tvheadend/XBMC combination, I switched to mythbuntu. However, today it began to say "welcome to ..." after booting.
[11:20] <Igramul> How can I turn that off?
[11:21] <Igramul> (I could not understand the third word, it was so loud that I had to press my hands on the ears.)
[13:53] <francesca> I have questions on mybuntu-control-center and ubuntu-studio 12.10
[13:55] <francesca> while  mythbuntu-control-center was installing primary-beackend and  frontend 0.26 , I answered to some debconf question, was it ok to answer?? question was about mysql, mythweb login and password...
[13:56] <francesca> I changed my ip from dhcp to fixed after installation of 0.26 primary-backend and frontend... was this an error??
[13:57] <francesca> The problem now is that nothings work. I can't run mythtv-setup , nor mythweb, not mythtv-frontend.  I'd like to how to purge database/mysql  and purge everything anf try again
[15:12] <francesca> Nobody in here?
[16:12] <Twiggy2cents> does the backup function in MCC clear the last backup or compare them at all?  Or does it just keep adding them?
[19:53] <francesca> In mythtv-setup , under video sources setup , i don't see nothing about xmltv. I suppose I haven't installed package for xmltv. which package are necessary?? I'm working with ubuntu-studio 12.10 . i installed mythtv 0.26
[20:39] <qwebirc61195> what are the system requirements?

[22:56] <qwebirc51592> Hello Myth world! Anyone around to assist an old man?
[22:59] <tgm4883> qwebirc51592, better to ask your question
[22:59] <qwebirc51592> Ah, hello! Sure thing...
[23:00] <qwebirc51592> I seem to be experiencing a failure of my video card somehow.. dmesg and xorg logs talk about a "soft lockup"
[23:00] <qwebirc51592> video / audio just stops, keyboard / mouse input doesn't do anything. BUT ssh is still up, mythweb still responds
[23:01] <qwebirc51592> as you might have guessed, VNC does not work
[23:01] <qwebirc51592> I am using proprietary Nvidia drivers for my GTX 460... I put together the system myself, could be a configuration issue
[23:02] <qwebirc51592> running latest and greatest 12.04.1 mythbuntu with full updates as of today
[23:07] <qwebirc51592> the computer sounds like it's running hot and fast, but "top" doesn't show much activity, except for 5/8 GB RAM "used"
