[07:34] <pitti> Good morning
[07:35] <pitti> Bonjour
[07:37] <didrocks> bonjour pitti! c'est à ton tour de te lever tard ;)
[07:38] <pitti> didrocks: oui, je ne suis pas très bien
[07:38] <pitti> seems my cold came back, after I was already over it
[07:40] <larsu> good morning!
[07:40] <didrocks> argh, take care pitti :/
[07:40] <didrocks> hey larsu! how are you?
[07:40] <larsu> didrocks, good thanks, and you?
[07:40] <pitti> hey larsu!
[07:40] <larsu> pitti, hi, gute Besserung!
[07:41] <didrocks> larsu: I'm fine, thanks!
[07:41] <larsu> is there a reason that `update-manager -d` doesn't work?
[07:41]  * larsu wants to finally update to R
[07:43] <mvo> larsu: do you have pending updates?
[07:43] <larsu> mvo, no
[07:43] <mvo> larsu: hm, does do-release-upgrade -d work?
[07:43] <pitti> oh, hey mvo, happy new year!
[07:44] <mvo> hey pitti, happy new year!
[07:44] <larsu> mvo, seems to work, thanks!
[07:45] <larsu> and happy new year ;)
[07:45] <mvo> cool
[07:45] <mvo> and happy new year larsu
[07:45] <larsu> thanks :)
[07:52] <didrocks> hey mvo! happy new year :-)
[08:15] <pitti> RAOF: hey Chris, how are you?
[08:15] <RAOF> pitti: Yo!
[08:16] <RAOF> pitti: I'm within one standard deviation of my long-term average :)
[08:16] <pitti> haha
[08:16] <pitti> RAOF: happy new year then!
[08:17] <RAOF> pitti: And to you, likewise!
[08:17] <pitti> RAOF: and may your health not deviate more than 1.5σ from the expected value :)
[08:18] <pitti> RAOF: so I wanted to ask you, do you know how and where X.org detects monitors?
[08:18] <pitti> RAOF: I already checked the X.org server itself and its xrandr extension; that doesn't just seem to read sysfs or so; it seems that's the responsibility of the individual device drivers?
[08:19] <pitti> RAOF: background is, I want to see whether and to which degree we can simulate monitors in a mock environment, for writing tsts
[08:19] <pitti> and tests, too
[08:19] <RAOF> The drivers we care about query the kernel.
[08:19] <pitti> so I was hoping it would just read syfs, but it doesn't
[08:19] <RAOF> Mocking that out is going to require mocking libdrm
[08:20] <RAOF> Specifically the handful of ioctls dealing with modesetting.
[08:20] <pitti> ah, so they are directly poking the hardware, not reading /sys/class/drm ?
[08:20] <RAOF> Correct.
[08:21] <pitti> RAOF: intercepting ioctls is already on my table
[08:21] <RAOF> You can quirk an edid by writing to the firmware-ish file, but that's not going to help if the output is not detected as connected, or if you want to fake, say, an HDMI output.
[08:21] <pitti> xvfb doesn't seem to have xrandr capability, so I guess we need to start the real X.org under some kind of dummy driver
[08:22] <pitti> RAOF: so I guess as we have to use a dummy driver anyway, that one coudl just report a set of fake monitors?
[08:22] <RAOF> Absolutely.
[08:23] <RAOF> That'd be a simple extension to xf86-video-dummy
[08:23] <pitti> right, that woudl have been my next question; is xserver-xorg-video-dummy the right driver for this kind of thing?
[08:23] <RAOF> ¹: For sufficiently boring boilerplaity values of “simple”
[08:24] <RAOF> I would think so, yes; it's pretty much what you're after - a no-hardware fake graphics driver.
[08:25] <pitti> do you know if that's sufficiently capable to run unity on?
[08:27] <pitti> RAOF: ok, thanks so far; I'll play around with this, see how to start X.org with the dummy driver, and where to plug in RR bits
[08:27] <soren> pitti: Funny, I looked into this just last night. What specifically are you wanting to test?
[08:27] <RAOF> If unity can run with software rendering it can run on dummy.
[08:28] <pitti> RAOF: oh, another question -- how does X.org detect the driver to use?
[08:28] <RAOF> Magic!
[08:29] <pitti> soren: I have no specific test right now; I want to evaluate how we can set up various "multiple monitor" scenarios and then test xrandr and unity within that
[08:29] <RAOF> pitti: It's got a pciid→driver switch statement buried in the bowels of it.
[08:29] <pitti> RAOF: right, I meant, does it again do its own hardware poking, or just iterate through /sys or /proc?
[08:30] <RAOF> It uses libpcithingamabob; I think that does /sys probing, from memory.
[08:30] <pitti> ah, libpciaccess0
[08:30] <RAOF> pitti: This *might* be superceded by the udev code, new in 1.13 (or 1.12); I've not looked at the driver matching code since that landed.
[08:30] <RAOF> pitti: Yeah, that one.
[08:30] <pitti> splendid, thanks
[08:31] <pitti> we can easily mock bits in /sys
[08:31] <pitti> soren: so what did you look at? starting X.org with the dummy driver?
[08:31] <pitti> RAOF: thanks for your help!
[08:31] <soren> pitti: Ok, I can't help much then. I was looking at slightly higher layers, but if you wat to be able to test xrandr itself, that's a different story.
[08:32] <seb128> hey desktopers
[08:32] <pitti> it's a seb!
[08:32] <pitti> bonjour mon ami
[08:32] <didrocks> salut seb128
[08:33] <soren> pitti: I was looking into adding some automatic monitor switching magic to XFCE and wondered how I could test it.
[08:33] <pitti> soren: doesn't that also require faking monitors?
[08:33] <soren> pitti: Gnome has its own abstraction for it, which should be easily mockable if you just want to test the unity bits.
[08:33] <pitti> in libgnome-desktop, yes
[08:34] <soren> Right.
[08:34] <seb128> pitti, hey, how are you?
[08:34] <seb128> didrocks, lut ;-)
[08:34] <pitti> seb128: my cold bounced back, so could be better, but ok for now
[08:35] <pitti> how are you?
[08:35] <seb128> I'm good thanks
[08:35] <pitti> soren: I thought that would just be a rather straight interface to xrandr
[08:35] <soren> pitti: I didn't actually write any code. I just looked at what it would take. I think I'd just have faked the "something changed" event and checked that it used the correct, new config. In unit tests, that is. I suspect you're doing something more integration test-ish?
[08:35] <pitti> soren: i. e. no file interface in between which you could intercept?
[08:35] <pitti> soren: ah, ok
[08:36] <soren> pitti: Both Gnome and XFCE uses the xrandr library. I suppose xrandr must as well. Perhaps that's easier to deal with?
[08:36] <pitti> soren: yeah, ideally we could start an X server (with -dummy or even xvfb, but that doesn't seem to work), run unity or gnome-shell or whatever in it, then change the mocked monitors, and verify that it adjusts accordingly
[08:37] <pitti> soren: that's the bit I'm currently investigating :)
[08:37] <pitti> soren: everything that uses /sys properly to detect hardware is easy to mock
[08:37] <pitti> everything that does its own probing with poking ports and ioctls is much harder, of course
[08:38] <pitti> but I guess X.org needs to work on more systems than just linux
[08:38] <soren> pitti: Oh, what I meant was a mock implementation of libxrandr itself, not the primitives that xrandr uses/manipulates.
[08:38] <pitti> ah
[08:38] <soren> pitti: I don't know if that'll be more or less work, really. I'm just throwing the idea out there.
[08:39] <pitti> soren: well, xrandr itself is pretty shallow
[08:39] <pitti> soren: it's little more than poking commands into the X socket
[08:39] <pitti> the actual detection and implementation of the commands happens on the driver side
[08:39] <pitti> (shallow from the mocking perspective, not from the logic, of cours)
[08:40] <soren> Do you mean libxrandr? Or /usr/bin/xrandr ?
[08:40] <pitti> both really
[08:40] <pitti> on the client side, xrandr has no hardware specific bits
[08:40] <soren> Right.
[08:41] <pitti> it just talks to the X socket, no to sysfs, ioctls, etc.
[08:41] <soren> Right.
[08:42] <soren> This seems like a good place to hook in to me.
[08:42] <soren> ..but you naturally understand much better what it is that you want to test. :)
[08:43] <soren> That saves you completely from having to think about hardware. I like to not think about hardware :)
[08:43] <pitti> indeed intercepting it at the X protocol level would be a lot simpler
[08:44] <pitti> I'm not actually interested in the sever-side layers; mostly in that applications and the desktop DTRT in various multiple-monitor scenarios
[09:01] <chrisccoulson> good morning everyone
[09:02] <Laney> hey
[09:04] <mvo> hey didrocks, happy new year to you as well!
[09:04] <didrocks> thanks ;)
[09:05] <didrocks> hey chrisccoulson, Laney
[09:05] <chrisccoulson> hey didrocks, Laney, how are you?
[09:05] <chrisccoulson> hi mvo, happy new year :)

[09:06] <mvo> hey chrisccoulson! happy new year to you as well :)
[09:06] <chrisccoulson> didrocks, tired. both daughters decided that they were far too cool to sleep last night
[09:07] <seb128> hey chrisccoulson, Laney
[09:07] <seb128> mvo, oh, a mvo! happy new year!
[09:07]  * seb128 hugs mvo
[09:07] <seb128> mvo, how are you?
[09:07] <didrocks> chrisccoulson: argh ;)
[09:07] <mvo> seb128: !!! happy new year
[09:07]  * mvo hugs seb128
[09:08] <mvo> seb128: I'm good, thanks, all very new, like I get up at 6 in the morning and commute to a office, a really strange experience. but I can hack on the train, so thats great
[09:08] <didrocks> mvo: how far are you from the university?
[09:09] <seb128> mvo, 6, man ... I decided to try to start working at reasonable time and be at the computer at 9am so I wake up between 8 and 9 and I already find that difficult :p
[09:09] <mvo> didrocks: its about ~35min by train plus a short bus trip
[09:09] <didrocks> seems reasonable :)
[09:09] <mvo> seb128: haha
[09:09] <mvo> didrocks: yeah, its not too bad
[09:09] <mvo> didrocks: but quite a change
[09:09] <didrocks> yeah, I can imagine :)
[09:10] <Laney> seeing /real people/!
[09:10] <didrocks> Laney: do they exist? I keep hearing from that, but never conducted that to facts
[09:10] <mvo> Laney: yes! out of my cave. I wasn't aware of how many people there are actually in the real -world ;)
[09:11] <mvo> didrocks: I have empiric evidence of that now! at least here in my part of the world they do exist :)
[09:11] <didrocks> 10:05:56      didrocks | chrisccoulson: regular ping about my thunderbird stalling issue btw :p
[09:11] <didrocks> chrisccoulson: I think you missed it ^
[09:11] <seb128> mvo, see, they were right when they put you in the "dog" category back then (was it in plymouth?) ... you like people after all ;-)
[09:11] <didrocks> mvo: waow! amazing :-)
[09:11] <didrocks> should be a German-only thing. I refuse to believe it! :-)
[09:12] <chrisccoulson> didrocks, yeah, i've not looked at any thunderbird stuff since i got back ;)
[09:12] <chrisccoulson> (thanks to firefox bugs)
[09:12] <mvo> seb128: lol
[09:12] <mvo> seb128: indeed, I think that was around the plymouth time - the funny thing is that my first thought about plymouth was the bootscreen, not the conference we had there :P
[09:13] <chrisccoulson> mvo, i don't believe real people exist. you must provide evidence :)
[09:13] <Laney> they're the people that bring my internet shopping deliveries, right?
[09:13] <chrisccoulson> actually, i think i saw a person walk past my window one day
[09:14] <mvo> chrisccoulson: haha, I can take pictures from the cafeteria - there are two kinds, man *and* woman
[09:14] <mvo> Laney: lol
[09:16] <seb128> mvo, lol, same here, I had to check on google if that spelling for the city was the same :p
[09:21] <mvo> unity is crashing btw on my dual monitor fglrx setup :P but I will look into that later, gtg
[10:07] <pitti> RAOF: hm, is there a replacement for -nohwaccess ? (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Rootless)
[10:10] <pitti> RAOF: nevermind, apparently not needed with using the dummy driver
[10:26] <pitti> didrocks: do you happen to know whether it's possible to run two unitys at the same time as an user/
[10:26] <pitti> didrocks: I tried "DISPLAY=:1 dbus-launch unity", and while that works, that still kills/restarts my "main" unity
[10:26] <didrocks> pitti: hum, I doubt it, first compiz is checking there is no other window compositor running
[10:26] <pitti> DISPLAY=:1 compiz seems to work fine
[10:26] <pitti> didrocks: well, my real session is on display :0
[10:26] <didrocks> ah, another DISPLAY
[10:26] <pitti> I tried the dbus-launch, but that doesn't seem to help either
[10:27] <didrocks> you have some services that you will need to dbus-launch as well
[10:27] <didrocks> but that shouldn't kill as it happens for you here
[10:28] <didrocks>     Window currentWmSnOwner = XGetSelectionOwner (dpy, wmSnAtom);
[10:28] <didrocks> this is the detection of the other compiz running
[10:29] <didrocks> it seems to be per dpy
[10:29] <didrocks> pitti: do you know if at least, compiz is trying to load its plugin?
[10:29] <pitti> didrocks: they actually do run in parallel, just that the original compiz restarts
[10:29] <pitti> didrocks: yes, that all seems to work fine
[10:29] <didrocks> pitti: well, unity is running --replace by default
[10:29] <pitti> DISPLAY=:1 compiz
[10:29] <pitti> flawless even with the same dbus
[10:30] <didrocks> even ok, so it's really unity, I don't see any reason off hand
[10:30] <pitti> didrocks: ok, nevermind; not a biggie for now
[10:30] <didrocks> but as you are stealing the unity-panel-service dbus connection, maybe that impact
[10:30] <didrocks> (it's dbus activated, so you need 2 of them)
[10:30] <pitti> that was my first guess, but with dbus-launch it has its own private bus
[10:31] <didrocks> oh right, so you have a second one running spawn by the second bus
[10:31] <didrocks> hum
[10:31] <pitti> anyway, my main exercise was to run unity under an user X.org with the dummy driver, which seems to work
[10:31] <didrocks> sweet :)
[10:32] <pitti> I'll try to do a screenshot
[10:32] <didrocks> that would be interesting :)

[13:36] <attente> the warning itself is the crash

[13:36] <larsu> it just continues running for me
[13:37] <attente> do the menus work for you?
[13:37] <larsu> yes, except for the emoticon menu
[13:37] <larsu> I guess because they are custom widgets?

[13:37] <attente> probably
[13:39] <larsu> actually the menu works, but the images aren't displayed
[13:40] <attente> is there a G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE for menu item images?
[13:40] <larsu> not upstream, no. We've been using x-canonical-icon for the indicators, but that probably doesn't work yet for the appmenu
[13:41] <larsu> by the way: what are you patching in indicator-appmenu?
[13:41] <attente> it's just an extra action group with the "unity." namespace
[13:41] <larsu> ah, good idea
[13:41] <attente> so that we don't have to go through the trouble of grabbing the old action group and merging it into ours
[13:42] <larsu> makes sense. And the action names are simply the labels of the menu items?
[13:42] <attente> all desrt's idea
[13:42] <attente> in general, yes
[13:42] <attente> but if a GtkAction is available, we use that instead
[13:43] <larsu> wow, this thing is much cleverer than I thought :)

[14:52] <gQuigs> https://launchpad.net/~libreoffice/+archive/ppa?field.series_filter=precise
[14:54] <seb128> gQuigs, hey, check with Sweetshark, he's maintaining libreoffice for Ubuntu
[14:54] <gQuigs> thanks seb128, ping Sweetshark
[14:55] <Sweetshark> pong
[14:55] <Sweetshark> gQuigs: you have 5 minutes, then Ill be in a TDF board of directors call
[14:55] <Sweetshark> ;)
[14:56] <Sweetshark> eh, tricky. first writing the content, then the ping.
[14:56] <gQuigs> thanks Sweetshark, I was just wondering what the status of the PPA is?.. it looks like 3.6.1-rc2 failed in someway
[14:58] <Sweetshark> yes, it seems ricotz did that. I asked him to always build in a separate ppa, but IIRC he ignored that here because it was the first 3.6 upload.
[14:58] <Sweetshark> still would have been better
[14:59]  * Sweetshark checks the buildlog
[15:00] <Sweetshark> seems like there are deps missing on precise. for the specific one a first workaround would be to disable the mediawiki extenion to be build.
[15:01] <Sweetshark> gQuigs: https://launchpad.net/~bdcomp <- he is currently working on backporting LO to precise, but he still has a lot to learn, so it still might take a while.
[15:01] <Sweetshark> anyway: gone for now, call ;)
[15:02] <gQuigs> Sweetshark: thanks!
[15:04] <Sweetshark> fscking timezone, was off the mark by one hour. anyway, I think you got what you needed for a start ;)
[15:06] <Sweetshark> gQuigs: https://launchpad.net/~bdcomp/+archive/backports/+packages <- there is a package building in there. note the big, fat "DO NOT USE IT" on the ppa though ;)
[15:07] <gQuigs> I did notice that... :)
[15:09] <larsu> attente, something tries to disconnect the handler twice. This might mean we have a circular menu structure somewhere...
[15:09] <attente> ok
[15:10] <attente> but the handler is on the UnityGtkMenuShell, right?
[15:10] <attente> not the GtkMenuShell, i believe
[15:11] <attente> er... sorry
[15:11] <larsu> yes, UnityGtkMenuShell is the GMenuModel, right?
[15:11] <attente> right, but actually the exported version of that
[15:11] <larsu> yes
[15:13] <attente> i'm just fixing that non-portable linking warning right now
[15:13] <larsu> attente, actually, the handler is on a UnityGtkMenuSection
[15:14] <larsu> oh, wait, I think I'm mistaken: the handler isn't disconnected twice
[15:14] <larsu> I got confused by dual debug printfs :)
[15:14] <attente> hehe
[15:22] <larsu> attente, so its much easier than this... just a object_unref too many. The question is: where? :P
[15:23] <attente> larsu, could it just be that the section is disappearing without the disconnect code knowing about it?
[15:24] <larsu> attente, well, the disconnect code has a reference on it, so it shouldn't disappear
[15:24] <larsu> but it definitely does, I put a weak ref on it
[15:24] <attente> :S
[15:24] <larsu> ya
[15:24] <larsu> :)
[15:24] <attente> ok, haha, thanks :)
[15:39] <larsu> attente, got it.

[15:39] <attente> larsu: what was it?
[15:39] <seb128> Laney, didrocks: can do
[15:39] <seb128> looking
[15:39] <Laney> merci
[15:39] <seb128> de rien, sorry for missing it earlier
[15:39] <didrocks> thanks seb128 :)
[15:39] <seb128> yw ;-)
[15:40] <larsu> attente, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1513350/
[15:40] <larsu> ah wait, that's your own function
[15:41] <larsu> Your log says "Run dispose to break cycles."
[15:41] <seb128> Laney, done
[15:41] <Laney> great
[15:42] <Laney> will upload empathy when that publishes then
[15:42] <larsu> attente, I'm pretty sure you shouldn't call g_object_run_dispose in this case
[15:42] <larsu> but it's a question for desrt, really
[15:42] <larsu> do you remember which problem this solved?
[15:43] <attente> larsu, i added that to break the ref cycle between shell and section when the section disappears
[15:43] <attente> or is supposed to disappear
[15:44] <larsu> hm, I'm not sure I know enough about your code to give good advice here :)
[15:44] <attente> but i thought the problem was that g_object_unref was getting called too many times
[15:45] <attente> but if the fix works, you're probably right
[15:50] <larsu> attente, hm. I'm not sure I fully understand it yet
[15:50] <larsu> (after what you just said)
[15:50] <attente> actually, i'm having a hard time understanding why it would fix the problem too...
[15:55] <desrt> smspillaz: using only DEFINE_TYPE macros?
[15:55] <desrt> smspillaz: doing anything odd from class_init() functions?
[15:55] <desrt> if you're using the stock get_type() from G_DEFINE_TYPE then the usual cause of this is that you're doing something bad in some sort of class_init
[15:56] <larsu> desrt, are weak refs notified on dispose?
[15:56] <desrt> otherwise, it could be an obscure race that I know we have in multi-threaded situations... would be strange to see that in the go-i scanner, though
[15:56] <desrt> unless, as above, you're calling weird stuff from class_init() :)
[15:56] <larsu> desrt, as in, if attente calls g_object_dispose manually, will weak refs be notified?
[15:56] <desrt> larsu: yes and no
[15:56] <desrt> larsu: no.
[15:56] <desrt> but they are notified before dispose() is called automatically after the last ref drops
[15:56] <larsu> I have a stack trace that looks like it
[15:56] <larsu> hm, weird
[15:56] <desrt> well
[15:57] <desrt> dispose() often results in the handler calling unref() on a lot of stuff
[15:57] <desrt> which in turn could obviously cause a weak notify
[15:57] <larsu> yeah but it's on the same object
[15:57] <desrt> hmm
[15:57] <desrt> odd
[15:57] <larsu> cycles?
[15:58] <desrt> i doubt it
[15:58] <desrt> read the trace...
[15:58] <desrt> then read the source :)
[15:58] <larsu> ya
[15:59] <larsu> desrt, in any case, running dispose manually is probably not a good idea, is it?
[15:59] <larsu> I mean, what if other objects still have references...
[15:59] <desrt> in my opinion dispose is completely stupid
[15:59] <larsu> I know
[15:59] <larsu> but that doesn't answer my question :)
[16:03] <attente> running dispose is supposed to be an idempotent operation, right?
[16:03] <larsu> yes
[16:11] <attente> desrt, want to meet an old friend for lunch today?
[16:12] <desrt> is he swiss?
[16:12] <attente> no, that's on the 19th, btw
[16:12] <desrt> cool :)
[16:13] <desrt> i'm probably up for it as long as the location is reasonable
[16:13] <desrt> although it would probably be nice to know who it is first

[16:38] <seb128> dobey, new revision will do
[16:49] <larsu> attente, sorry, I was distracted for a bit, but I have the real solution
[16:49] <larsu> for which I had to go into gobject.c
[16:49] <larsu> not nice
[16:50] <attente> what is it?
[16:50] <larsu> so g_object_dispose calls g_signal_handlers_destroy
[16:50] <larsu> pretty simple :)
[16:51] <larsu> I think the real fix here is to not call dispose. If you're worried about cyclic references, use a weak ref on one side
[16:52] <attente> huh, ok, i'll give it a shot :)
[16:52] <larsu> or no reference, if you can be sure that the section's shell pointer is only valid as long as the shell also has a ref on the section
[16:52] <larsu> the latter is probably the easier solution in your case
[16:52] <larsu> the same goes for "items" btw, dispose is called on them too
[16:54] <attente> larsu, i think you're right, there's no reason for these to have a strong reference to their parents, no reason i can remember right now at least
[16:55] <attente> larsu, thanks for your help once again :)
[16:55] <larsu> attente, no problem :)
[17:05] <desrt> attente: good general rule: don't call dispose
[17:05] <desrt> if you're trying to do that you're probably trying to do something wrong
[17:07] <attente> desrt: is there a proper way to break a ref cycle without using dispose?
[17:07] <desrt> don't create the cycle
[17:08] <attente> lesson learned
[17:08] <attente> :)
[17:28] <desrt> attente: seriously, though
[17:29] <desrt> reference cycles are an annoying hazard of refcounted OO (which you're surely aware of from your obj-C upbringing)
[17:29] <desrt> techniques used to break them are workarounds and it's usually possible to just avoid the cycle in the first place
[17:29] <desrt> through more careful design of your object relationships
[17:31] <desrt> i often find when i'm in a situation where A depends on B and B depends on A then at least one of them could be split into two separate classes (let's split B into B and B2) such that B depends on A and B2 and A depends only on B2 (ie: B is the public-facing part and B2 is some internal utility)
[17:31] <desrt> that way B2 stays for as long as either A or B are around but safely goes away when both are gone, and there are no cycles

[18:24] <cyphermox> is it supposed to be best to put .vapi files under the versioned /usr/share/vala-0.XX/vapi/  or the unversioned directory /usr/share/vala/vapi/ ?
[18:34] <ricotz> cyphermox, unversioned
[18:35] <ricotz> cyphermox, the versioned directory is exclusive for the vapis shipped with vala itself
[18:35] <cyphermox> ack
[18:36] <cyphermox> is that described anywhere in policy or something? because it's not really obvious
[18:37] <ricotz> not sure if it is written somewhere, but it is common sense for upstream shipped bindings

[19:39] <ricotz> jbicha, hi :)
[19:39] <ricotz> syncing harfbuzz leads to some problems while graphite2 isnt multiarched :\
[19:43] <ricotz> i guess graphite2 should be synced from exp too (isnt multiarched yet though)
[20:27] <jbicha> ricotz: ok, the exp. graphite2 has a soname bump so maybe we should just wait for multiarch?
[20:29] <jbicha> are you actually using harfbuzz for anything yet?
[20:35] <ricotz> jbicha, syncing and transitioning it doesnt interfere with a later multiarch enablement
[20:35] <ricotz> jbicha, yes, the new pango uses it
[20:36] <ricotz> so does the whole gnome stack therefore
[20:37] <micahg> ricotz: well, it's potentially rebuilding the reverse dependencies twice
[20:37] <ricotz> micahg, hmm, i dont think so
[20:38] <ricotz> but multiarch first is fine too
[20:38] <micahg> oh, is graphite2 already multiarched?
[20:38] <ricotz> no
[20:38] <micahg> right, so, the SONAME bump is one rebuild, and multiarching is potentially another depending on what paths are used where
[20:40] <ricotz> micahg, the library look up shouldn't break when it is moved from "lib" to "lib/.../"
[20:40] <ricotz> or does it
[20:40] <ricotz> ?
[20:41] <micahg> ricotz: that depends on what the package is doing during build (binaries might continue to work, but the package might FTBFS)
[20:42] <ricotz> i see
[20:42] <micahg> binaries could break as well if it's doing something silly like manually checking paths
[20:42] <ricotz> alright
[20:45] <jbicha> ricotz: harfbuzz is still optional for latest pango, right?
