[15:55] <qwebirc41109> I have installed the latest mythbuntu, but I seem to have several issues. Which logs and command outputs would be most useful troubleshooting?
[16:01] <rhpot1991> qwebirc41109: depends on the issues
[17:08] <DarthFrog> Hi folks,  Mythbuntu Control Centre has set the repos to Quantal.  Is this correct (I am running Quantal)?  Or should I set the source to Precise?
[17:08] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, um. If you are running Quantal, why wouldn't you want the repos set to Quantal?
[17:10] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  Because I'm getting errors and Mythtbuntu.org says it only supports LTS from now on.
[17:10] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, link?
[17:10] <DarthFrog> Errors when I try to run "apt-get dist-upgrade", that is.
[17:10] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, the reason I ask, is I'm about fixing things if they are unclear
[17:11] <tgm4883> and Mythbuntu.org shouldn't say it supports only LTS releases from now on. It should say we only release ISOs for LTS releases
[17:11] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, so to answer your last question, it should be Quantal, and please pastebin the errors
[17:12] <DarthFrog> !pastebin
[17:12] <Zinn> when pasting more than 5 lines of data please use http://mythbuntu.pastebin.com so you don't flood the channel.  Then please post the link in the channel.

[17:14] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  Ah, I think I misunderstood the announcement then, about moving to LTS.  I thought that was an excellent move, BTW.
[17:16] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, we agree :)
[17:16] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, you can safely ignore that error
[17:17] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, I had forgotten about that issue, will fix
[17:17] <DarthFrog> yeah, but that error screws up my update script.
[17:17] <tgm4883> ah
[17:17] <DarthFrog> Should I just remove that repo?
[17:17] <tgm4883> well let me see if I can fix that easily
[17:37] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  Did you get it fixed?
[18:02] <DarthFrog> Before I go spend $500, could anyone tell me if the Hauppauge HD-PVR 1212 works well with Mythbuntu?
[18:06] <Shadow__X> 500? where are you buying it
[18:07] <Shadow__X> DarthFrog: http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Hauppauge_HD-PVR
[18:07] <DarthFrog> Shadow__X:  I'll be buying 2 and a Shaw HD terminal.
[18:08] <DarthFrog> Shadow__X:  Yeah, I read that page.  I was hoping to talk to someone who's actually doing what I want to do. :-)
[18:08] <Shadow__X> what is that exactly
[18:10] <DarthFrog> Set up two Shaw HD terminals (Motorola DCX3200-M) with two Hauppauge 1212 units into MythTV 0.26 (Mythbuntu).
[18:10] <Shadow__X> ok well first you can look at setting one up
[18:11] <Shadow__X> as long as the terminal outputs component i am not seeing what might be the problem? unless, you are trying to change channels on both of them using one firewire connection. Also, there is a good chance no one has tried your setup before and you might need to be the first and try it out yourself
[18:12] <DarthFrog> Do you happen to know how well the IR Blaster on the 1212 works?  I've been nothing but frustrated trying to get a Command IR to work consistently.
[18:12] <Shadow__X> amazon has the 1212 for 170 btw
[18:13] <DarthFrog> I can get it locally for CDN$149.
[18:13] <Shadow__X> i do not personally have one but it seems like there are people who do use them to change channels
[18:13] <Shadow__X> well thats good
[18:13] <DarthFrog> http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/hauppauge-hauppauge-wintv-hdpvr-video-recorder-1219-1219/10107259.aspx
[18:14] <Shadow__X> i have used firewire to change channels and record off of my box ( i realize that changing channels may or may not work for you
[18:14] <DarthFrog> The 1219 has both English and French manuals.
[18:15] <DarthFrog> You're lucky.  Shaw is rather anal about such things.  Firewire is locked out and everything is encrytped.
[18:15] <Shadow__X> well are there firwire ports? you could possible try to change channels through firewire at leat
[18:16] <DarthFrog> The @#(& are implementing a new guide system for the HD terminals.  They will be changing the channel mappings from what Schedules Direct reports.
[18:16] <Shadow__X> are you using this for the ir blaster http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Using_an_IR_Blaster_with_MythTV#Configuring_Myth_Backend
[18:17] <DarthFrog> The 1212 comes with its own ir blaster.
[18:17] <Shadow__X> did you look at the link i sent you? its about setting up the blaster
[18:17] <Shadow__X> you said you were having trouble with the blaster
[18:17] <DarthFrog> http://www.commandir.com/content/view/19/31/
[18:18] <DarthFrog> is the one I've tried to use.  It works properly (i.e. the set-top box changes channels properly) about 85% of the time.
[18:18] <Shadow__X> try what i linked to you
[18:19] <Shadow__X> there is a link to a channel change script
[18:20] <DarthFrog> Thanks, but I've given up on it.  The output from the digital terminals (not HD terminals) was connected to Hauppauge PVR-150 cards.  They no longer seem to work with Myth so I'm replacing them with the Hauppauge HD-PVRs.
[18:21] <Shadow__X> i would look to see what is the problem
[18:21] <DarthFrog> We've re-written the channel change script.
[18:21] <DarthFrog> The problem seems to be the ivtv drivers.
[18:21] <DarthFrog> They seem to be orphaned.
[18:21] <Shadow__X> well digital is all around better
[18:22] <DarthFrog> Yes, I agree digital is better.
[18:23] <DarthFrog> however I have 4 digital terminals and a whole bunch of Hauppauge 350s, 500s, 250s and 150s that are now obsolete.
[18:23] <Shadow__X> since you are getting the hdpvr local you could always try it and if you dont like it return it
[18:23] <Shadow__X> i have some pentium 3's that are now obsolete
[18:24] <DarthFrog> :-)
[18:37] <DarthFrog> Shadow__X:  Here's the modified change channels script we run:
[18:37] <DarthFrog> http://pastebin.com/adFdYMiX
[18:37] <DarthFrog> it adds locking.
[18:37] <Shadow__X> why would you want to lock it?
[18:38] <DarthFrog> Because things wouldn't work with out it.  Commands to set-top boxes were being dropped.
[18:38] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, sorry, got pulled into a meeting
[18:39] <tgm4883> doing it now
[18:39] <Shadow__X> oh, i really don't know anything about lirc stuff. I only use the mce remotes and thats it
[18:39] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  No problem.  Thanks for getting back to it.
[18:39] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, bah, looks like it will take 7 hours to fix :/
[18:39] <DarthFrog> tgm4883: Ouch!!!!
[18:40] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, basically, that PPA doesn't get a lot of updates pushed to it. So what is happening is nothing is in it for Quantal yet, so techncially, the PPA doesn't exist
[18:40] <DarthFrog> OK, then I'll just delete the repo. :-)
[18:40] <tgm4883> I just pushed something to it, but it's queued to build in 7 hours
[18:41] <tgm4883> so yea, you can disable the repo or wait
[18:41] <Shadow__X> which repo
[18:41] <DarthFrog> Well, I'll wait then.  I won't be doing a dist-upgrade again till tomorrow.
[18:41] <DarthFrog> Shadow__X:  mythbuntu-testing-quantal
[18:41] <Shadow__X> ah ok
[18:42] <Shadow__X> btw is live streaming on .25.3 supposed to work at all resolutions? I am getting blocky video in most resolutions
[18:45] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, I would expect it to be fixed by then :)
[18:45] <tgm4883> Shadow__X, unsure, I don't use 0.25.3 or HLS
[18:53] <Shadow__X> hmm, i would upgrade to .26 but it seems like the windows builds are behind and the machine i was going to do my own builds isnt working with me

[22:39] <Shadow__X> one of my frontends is not staying suspended. It goes into suspend but then turns right back on. This started happening when i upgraded to 12.04
