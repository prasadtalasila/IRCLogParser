[01:40] <ochosi> i really love it
[01:40] <ochosi> should go on our website
[01:40] <Unit193> That's awesome.

[01:41] <bluesabre> I just feel like that's the feeling we all get once every few days :)
[06:50] <Noskcaj> just found a bug in 12.10, at least xubuntu amd64. when you make a program open in half the screen by dragging it to the top, pressing the maximise button maxes the top part of the window go above the screen
[07:22] <Noskcaj> ping to anyone online
[07:40] <knome> yes?
[07:45] <Noskcaj> knome, please read the previous post, just want to check it's not already reported

[08:17] <knome> i believe xfwm4
[08:18] <knome> re: confirm on real hw: no, not at this moment
[08:18] <knome> Unit193 maybe
[08:22] <Noskcaj> how would i best describe the bug?
[08:23] <astraljava> Every screen? Or is it just downloading the restriced-extras package at that time?
[08:24] <knome> Noskcaj, your description seems fine and sensible
[08:24] <Noskcaj> title?
[08:25] <knome> "Tiling a window + maximizing sends it out of screen" ?
[08:25] <knome> or sends it partly
[08:26] <knome> of you paste me the bug number after you've filed, i can make sure it gets the needed attention

[08:27] <knome> thanks
[08:28] <Noskcaj> just found what causes it, mess around with how far up the screen you drag to make it happen
[08:28] <Noskcaj> and you will see
[08:33] <Noskcaj> i will check if it affects 13.04 tomorrow
[08:36] <knome> probably yes since it also has xfce 4.10
[08:36] <knome> this is a relatively new feature

[11:14] <Unit193> knome: I'm sorry but I don't know if I know what that response is to.
[11:15] <pjotr> Hello, I have a question about Xubuntu.
[11:16] <pjotr> Will there be a second point release of Xubuntu 12.04 (12.04.2)?
[11:24] <pjotr> ochosi: do you happen to know whether Xubuntu 12.04 will get a second point release (12.04.2)?
[11:25] <ochosi> pjotr: i think yes, but better wait for someone to confirm it ;)
[11:31] <pjotr> OK... :)
[11:33] <pjotr> The point releases are becoming more important because of the new rolling kernel policy for LTS's.... So a Xubuntu 12.04.2 would be cool to have available, especially for installing on very new hardware.
[11:39] <knome> there will
[11:48] <pjotr> knome: that's good news. Thanks for the info!  :)
[12:02] <knome> micahg, mr_pouit: is xubuntu-bugs receiving notifications of all xfwm4 themes already?
[12:22] <knome> erh
[12:23] <knome> xfwm4 bugs.
