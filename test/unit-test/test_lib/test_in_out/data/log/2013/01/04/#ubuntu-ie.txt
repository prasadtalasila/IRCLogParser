[15:49] <tdr112> do you know all the airports in london
[15:49] <tdr112> I am looking to go to Chelmsford
[15:49] <tdr112> wondering where i should fly in
[15:49] <czajkowski> hmm
[15:49] <czajkowski> let me go and see
[15:50] <czajkowski> hmm north of london
[15:51] <czajkowski> stanstead is 40 mins by bus
[15:51] <czajkowski> or trains 90 mins
[15:52] <czajkowski> just under an hour to london city airport, but that's an expensive one to fly in and out of
[15:56] <tdr112> i will have a look at flights from dublin
[16:17] <tdr112> thanks czajkowski I think i will go for stanstead
[16:19] <czajkowski> cool
[16:19] <czajkowski> dont forget booking your train or bus tickets in advance cuts down on costs also
[16:19] <czajkowski> and the queues :)
