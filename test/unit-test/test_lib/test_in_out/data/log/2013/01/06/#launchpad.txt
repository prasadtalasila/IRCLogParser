[05:47] <ihashacks> Can I work with someone here on this question I asked: https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+question/218421
[05:48] <ihashacks> ... or is it better to wait for comments on LP itself?
[05:50] <micahg> ihashacks: https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA/Uploading#Using_packages_from_other_distributions
[06:06] <ihashacks> so now I have ~/.dput.cf with http://paste.ubuntu.com/1502508/
[06:06] <ihashacks> and I run 'dput backports-force-quantal nmap_6.25-1_source.changes'
[06:06] <ihashacks> but still get 'Error: uploading files for distribution UNRELEASED to backports-force-quantal not allowed.'
[06:06] <micahg> oh, heh, that's local error :)
[06:07] <micahg> it's referring to what's in debian/changelog
[06:07] <micahg> or more specifically in the source.changes file
[06:12] <ihashacks> holy hell, all I had to do was "sed -i 's/UNRELEASED/unstable/g' debian/changelog"
[06:12] <ihashacks> Is that a standard procedure or something with how nmap got built during my bzr from quantal and merge-upstream?
[06:13] <micahg> ihashacks: normally you'd use the Ubuntu release in question in there
[06:13] <ihashacks> I kinda thought that, but the existing one had "unstable" everywhere... probably becauze I merge-upstream'ed it?
[06:14] <micahg> ihashacks: that's because we have no diff from Debian
[06:17] <ihashacks> nvm, I look down further and there are references to jaunty
[06:18] <ihashacks> wow, so simple - I swear I google'd that and searched on answers.launchpad.net first!
[06:18] <ihashacks> Successfully uploaded packages.
[06:18] <ihashacks> tyvm!
[06:18] <micahg> sure
[06:38] <ihashacks> you were right. unstable was rejected, but quantal was accepted.

[12:22] <Aeyoun> Hi. “Version older than that in the archive. 1.0-0~4~quantal1 <= 1.0-0ubuntu1~ppa”. The first number is from the daily build receipt and the latter is from dput upload. Why would the daily builds ise a different version number? How should I resolve this?
[15:29] <shadeslayer> hi, for some reason I keep getting this from launchpad : dget: curl kio-mtp_0%2Bgit20130104-0ubuntu1~ppa1.dsc https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/experimental/+files/kio-mtp_0%2Bgit20130104-0ubuntu1~ppa1.dsc failed
[15:29] <shadeslayer> when I try to use : dget -xu https://launchpad.net/\~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/experimental/+files/kio-mtp_0%2Bgit20130104-0ubuntu1\~ppa1.dsc
[15:31] <shadeslayer> ah there we go
