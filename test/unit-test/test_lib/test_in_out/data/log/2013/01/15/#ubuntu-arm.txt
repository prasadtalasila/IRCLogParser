[00:10] <jj234> is there an easy way to try a 12.10 release from 7/12?
[00:11] <xnox> what do you mean by 7/12
[00:11] <xnox> ?
[00:14] <jj234> July-2012
[00:15] <jj234> I suppose it was a beta realease
[00:15] <jj234> I saw an article about an omap4 release with that date on it, I'm just curious how I could find that particular release
[00:15] <XorA> wouldnt 12.07 be the Linaro release on top of 12.04?
[00:19] <xnox> jj234: this is not a linaro support channel... maybe try #linaro?
[00:19] <xnox> but ubuntu 12.10 is awesome on all ARM platforms =))))
[00:20] <XorA> *cough*
[00:20] <xnox> XorA: bless you =)
[00:20] <XorA> all arm platforms it supports you mean :-D
[00:20] <xnox> naturally =)
[00:20] <jj234> what were the big improvements over 12.04?
[00:22] <xnox> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuDesktop
[00:22] <xnox> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseNotes/UbuntuServer
[00:22] <xnox> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Core
[00:23] <xnox> all three had many improvements over 12.04, depending what you care about, some of them may be "big" for you.
[00:23]  * xnox personally likes the improved pandaboard installer & more polished ac100 images.
[00:23] <xnox> and nexus7 support.
[00:24] <infinity> There's no nexus7 support in 12.10, just sketchy out-of-archive images.
[00:24] <lilstevie> :p
[00:27] <xnox> infinity: at least it doesn't fry the speakers.....
[00:27] <AmEv> Heh...
[00:32] <AmEv> Duh. Stock CM10 kernel don't have VT...
[00:33] <AmEv> At least I can try building a kernel.
[00:37] <AmEv> Well, sound works in chroot, but not graphics -_-
[00:41] <AmEv> Note to self: ADB in Linux is LOADS better than ADB in Win32...
[00:54] <AmEv> Whee... Compressing a kernel source .zip on-device... fun....
[00:55] <AmEv> Will keep changes documented, of course ;)
[01:04] <AmEv> Of course it's going to cross-compile faster on your quad-core x86 than compile on your dual-core ARM tablet....
=== ahs3` is now known as ahs3
=== zz_chihchun is now known as chihchun
[03:02] <AmEv> Hmm... Stock kernel source isn't happy with native compiler...
[03:02] <AmEv> Looks like it was designed with the NDK compiler in mind.
[03:17] <jj234> does anyone know which TI omap PPA I should us for pandaboard?  I'm currently running 12.04 and I installed the TI extras which now causes great instability
[03:17] <jj234> my board crashes under heavy network load
[03:29] <infinity> jj234: Are you sure you needed TI extras at all?
[03:30] <jj234> no, not at all
[03:30] <infinity> jj234: Other than some accelerated codecs, it's entirely unnecessary.
[03:30] <jj234> I guess I thought maybe there had been some kernel improvements
[03:30] <jj234> i saw an article comparing 12.10 to 12.04 with impressive improements
[03:30] <jj234> improvements
[03:31] <infinity> Sure, then run 12.10 with the Ubuntu kernel.
[03:31] <jj234> I really do want the codecs though...at least down the roda
[03:31] <jj234> road
[03:31] <infinity> All, well then.  You may be stuck with the kernel's in TI's PPA.  Unless their 12.10 PPA was built to use the distro kernel, I can't recall anymore.
[03:32] <jj234> I don't believe it was
[03:32] <jj234> someone in #pandaboard told me their PPA has problems, but I couldn't really confirm
[03:32] <jj234> and that there are several of them, and that I need to make sure I use the correct one...again, I can't really confirm
[04:56] <kulve> Rjs: good that you got it working

[07:19] <reisei> hi, all! I have a question about nexus 7: I can suspend this device from Unity, but how can I suspend it from console?
[07:24] <infinity> reisei: pm-suspend
[07:26] <reisei> infinity: it's waking up immediately D:
[07:27] <infinity> reisei: Ahh well, that, I might not be able to help with while I'm heading off to bed.
[07:27] <ipl31_> Hello, I would like to test an armhf rootfs I built but I can't find a qemu + kernel combo that can mount it
[07:28] <ipl31_> does anyone have a suggestion for -M option that would give me vga and be able to access a disk image?
[07:29] <reisei> infinity: okay then...
[07:40] <reisei> What can be wrong with suspend if nexus 7 wakes up immediately?
[07:42] <kulve> try something like: sleep 1 && pm-suspend ?
[07:51] <reisei> kulve: that didn't work.
[07:57] <raster> reisei: i know whats wrong
[07:57] <raster> :)
[07:58] <raster> its easy enough to fix
[08:08] <reisei> raster: so, how can I fix it?
[08:08] <reisei> raster: and what's wrong? :)
[08:10] <raster> muahahhahaha
[08:11]  * raster dangles the carrot in front of reisei 
[08:11] <raster> so close
[08:11] <raster> and yet...
[08:11] <raster> so far
[08:11]  * raster eats his cake
[08:13] <raster> aaah ok enuf with the theatrics
[08:13] <raster> rfkill
[08:13] <raster> suspend happens to not kill wifi
[08:13] <raster> wifi stays on
[08:13] <raster> wifi interrupt wakes entire os
[08:13] <raster> the moment any packet pops up on the network
[08:13] <raster> u need to rfkill before suspend
[08:18] <reisei> raster: thank you, it works
[08:25] <reisei> raster: and did wake-on-wlan work?
[09:10] <raster> reisei: i havent tried wake on wlan
[09:10] <raster> u mean send it a special wake on lan packet?
[09:12] <infinity> WoL over wireless?  How can that work when you're no longer connected to the AP?
[09:15] <infinity> "- Standby Mode Only - Because wireless clients must remain connected to the BSS at all times, standby mode is the lowest power state supported. Hibernation or full power off states will not work because no power is provided to the wireless NIC to maintain network association."
[09:15] <infinity> Look at that.  WoWLAN exists.
[09:15] <infinity> And it's as awful as I suspected.
[09:17] <reisei> raster: yes, the special packet.
[09:18] <raster> nup
[09:18] <raster> havent tried/bothered
[09:18] <raster> thus rfkill is good enough for me
[09:18] <raster> :)
[09:19] <infinity> It's not likely to be something you can do unless the wireless is on the SoC either.  If it's actually a USB part or something, there's about a 0 chance that it gets power when the machine's in standby.
[09:20] <infinity> (And even if it *does* live close enough to the SoC to be technically possible, it needs hardware support for the feature)
[09:20] <reisei> infinity: it was developed by some people.
[09:21] <reisei> I thought it supported in Ubuntu.
[09:21] <infinity> reisei: Yeah, I just spent the last 10 minutes reading up on the spec/standard.
[09:21] <infinity> reisei: Software support isn't enough for WoWLAN, it's very hardware-dependent.
[09:22] <infinity> (Remember the old days when you couldn't do WoL without your PCI nic having a little power cable snaking to you motherboard?  Yeah.  That pain, all over again.)
[09:25] <raster> nd lucky for me... i dont need wowlan ...
[09:25] <raster> so i dont need to care
[09:25] <reisei> infinity: but it also needs this function be supported in drivers.
[09:25] <raster> all i care is that when my n7 suspends. it suspends and damned well stays that way
[09:25] <raster> :)
[09:26] <reisei> raster: even if you press the button?
[09:26] <raster> i'm much more worried about the lack of vsynced gl rendering in thetegrat3 drivers
[09:26] <infinity> Har har.
[09:26] <raster> and i have a sneaking suspicion that they do copies and not buffer swaps
[09:26] <raster> that lack of vsync offends me highly
[09:26] <raster> reisei:  well power button wakes it up -= that i want :)
[09:27] <raster> :)
[09:29] <raster> also playing mp3s is nasty
[09:29] <raster> its skip-heaven
[09:29] <raster> gst seems to be happy to use the hw decoder to do it
[09:29] <raster> it still eats thru cpu along the way
[09:30] <raster> and is an awesome skippathon with the cpu freq jumping about like a rubber crazy-ball
[09:30] <raster> i so need some time to sink some love into my n7 and sort things out
[09:32] <reisei> by the way, how can I make the system image file? It contains just rootfs?
[09:32]  * raster shrugs
[09:32] <raster> durno
[09:52] <reisei> nobody knows :(
[09:56] <raster> someone does
[09:56] <raster> they just arent here and talking to you :)
[10:00] <reisei> so, then I'll keep asking :)

[13:11] <reisei> please-please, tell me, how can I make my own image file for nexus 7...
[13:17] <kulve> debootsrap
[13:18] <reisei> kulve: but how can I pack it?
[13:20] <kulve> I don't know the details how ubuntu creates it's images. I do my own rootfs (usually not ubuntu based) and I just copy the rootfs
[13:22] <reisei> kulve: how do yo copy it?
[13:23] <kulve> I use the moslo stuff mentioned here: http://ruedigergad.com/2013/01/08/new-rootfs-tarball-of-plasma-active-for-nexus-7/ With that you can just mount the partition over usb and then do whatever you want with it
[13:24] <kulve> actually it's this post: http://ruedigergad.com/2012/12/21/plasma-active-for-nexus-7-running-the-touch-optimized-plasma-active-linux-distribution-on-nexus-7/
[13:28] <reisei> I do need more simple way of flashing the system. I just need to create the image for my purposes with the preinstalled packages..
[13:30] <reisei> why is the creation of image such a big secret? :)
[13:31] <kulve> I believe it's not secret, there just isn't a simple way to create a full blown rootfs
[13:31] <ogra_> is not a secret, its just that nobody ever takes the time to properly document it for endusers
[13:32] <ogra_> rootfs is built using livecd-rootfs which in turn is a wrapper to live-build
[13:32] <ogra_> post processing (bootability, partitioning an image if needed etc) is done by debian-cd
[13:33] <ogra_> publishing, naming and post processing for publication (torrents or so) is done by cdimage
[13:33] <ogra_> code for all of them is on launchpad (see the ubuntu-cdimage team)
[13:34] <ogra_> for creating the nexus7 rootfs tarball see the livecd-rootfs source
[13:36] <reisei> ogra_: thank you very much! You helped me. I'll go now and read the manuals :)
[13:36] <ogra_> i dont think there are manuals
[13:36] <ogra_> the source code is the doc :)
[13:37] <reisei> ogra_: d'oh
[13:37] <reisei> it's okay too :)
[13:37] <ogra_> apt-get source livecd-rootfs ----> cd to source ---> grep -r nexus7 *
[13:38] <ogra_> (note thats only in the raring source package)
[13:40] <reisei> ogra_: ok... if I'll be in trouble, can I ask you again?:)
[13:40] <ogra_> sure
[13:40] <reisei> ogra_: thank you!
[13:40] <kulve> reisei: maybe you should document your steps while at it ;)
[13:42] <reisei> kulve: that's not a bad idea :) I should try...

[18:55] <therve> hi!
[18:56] <therve> I've installed 12.10 on a pandaboard
[18:56] <therve> booting the installer on the SD card, and installing on a SD via USB
[18:57] <therve> is there a way to remove the installer SD and use the one with the install directly?
