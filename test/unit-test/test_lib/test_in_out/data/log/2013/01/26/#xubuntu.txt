[00:45] <frejjj> btw, i am using an UEFI bios, and i installed GRUB on /dev/sdb/ which is the hdd that holds my main windows 7 partitions, does UEFI bios need some special setup?

[00:46] <frejjj> Unit193, doh, i am on the internet now? and everything works in FF etc, can google etc.
[00:47] <frejjj> thanks for that link Unit193, will read!

[00:55] <frejjj> i just did not know the root passwd for xubuntu live cd so i created a new one

[02:13] <Guest7267> Hi. All my title bars are grey. How do I make the focused window be blue? Yes, I have pressed a lot of obvious-looking buttons, but no result.
[03:58] <Riberty> how can i get .bashrc to work?
[03:59] <Unit193> What do you mean by getting it to work?
[04:01] <Riberty> i looked at the .bashrc file and it said that i needed to put my alisess into .bash_aliases, which i did but i get error msg
[04:02] <Unit193> What error?
[04:02] <Riberty> actually i put a alias into .bashrc
[04:02] <Riberty> alias conke=’(leafpad /home/manuel/.conkyrc  &)’
[04:02] <Unit193> Should be like   alias why='cat /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs'
[04:03] <Riberty> terminal outputs no command 'conke'
[04:03] <Unit193> Did you re-source it?
[04:03] <Unit193> As in, open another terminal?
[04:04] <Riberty> oh ok
[04:05] <Riberty> ok that worked. so if i wanted to edit multiple documents i would put "&" sign between each?
[04:06] <Unit193> Can't you just either open with the file manager, or leafpad ~/.con<tab> ?
[04:08] <Riberty> well im editing multiple conky docs and their scripts
[04:08] <Riberty> so its a lot easier to type in one command to link all the documents to open at once
[04:59] <rk0n> What's the app called that regular Ubuntu uses for audio control? I'd like to install it on my xubuntu setup.
[05:05] <holstein> rk0n: theres pavucontrol
[05:05] <rk0n> Yeah, I found it thank you. Do you know how I can set the tray icon to show? I'm trying to figure it out right now.
[05:07] <rk0n> Padevchooser looks like, I'll try it outl.
[05:08] <rk0n> Okay apparently that's a really old thread, heh.
[06:53] <lewis1711> how does one control the channel that the volume up keys change? using them produces no audible change, so I am guessing they are working on a different channel
[06:53] <lewis1711> the media hot keys I mean, volume +, volume -, mute
[06:56] <heraclitis> Anyone know if xubuntu runs well in a virtualbox?
[06:56] <heraclitis> I want to virtualize xubuntu in a xubuntu host.
[07:12] <nicholosophy> when transferring files between two disks, I seem to get this pausing of all other gui programs
[07:13] <nicholosophy> thought it might be thunar but nautilus is doing it too
[07:13] <nicholosophy> any suggestions?
[07:14] <heraclitis> use cp and mv from cli
[07:15] <nicholosophy> heh
[07:16] <heraclitis> the syntax is "cp </dir/to/source/file> </dir/to/destination/file>" (if you want to copy)
[07:17] <nicholosophy> yer I know
[07:17] <nicholosophy> cheers
[07:17] <heraclitis> Well that's my suggestion.
[07:17] <heraclitis> Lol
[07:18] <nicholosophy> :)
[09:00] <heraclitis> what is the minimum ram allocation necessary for xubuntu to run with no issues?

[11:04] <heraclitis> I just installed on virtualbox, and it asked me all the same questions, including the encrypted lvm questions, username/password, etc. I saw no differences. That's why I ask.
[11:14] <heraclitis> I figured it out, thanks

[14:22] <MoL0ToV> howto add autologin on xubuntu?
[14:38] <koegs> MoL0ToV: http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/
[15:09] <baizon> i dont understand it... open google.com, type in autologin xubuntu and the first result is what youre searching :/
[15:12] <koegs> baizon: we are the better google frontend
[15:12] <baizon> i think so
[15:12] <baizon> it takes less time to type that in google then ask here =)
[15:41] <MoL0ToV> if i use the fn +f4/f5 keys, brightness don't change. is a keyboard problem? i can change by applet..
[15:43] <baizon> MoL0ToV: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Debugging/Backlight
[15:44] <Cheri703> MoL0ToV: we discussed this yesterday, you said the backlight is fine it is just a matter of having the functions mapped to the keyboard. did you search your model and that issue? Have you checked out custom keyboard mapping options?
[15:49] <MoL0ToV> i searched the model but no results
[15:50] <MoL0ToV> i'm trying xev | sed -n 's/^.*state \([0-9].*\), keycode *\([0-9]\+\) *\(.*\), .*$/keycode \2 = \3, state = \1/p'
[15:50] <Cheri703> what is the model again?
[15:50] <MoL0ToV> on xubuntu
[15:50] <MoL0ToV> but nothing appears when i stryke the keys
[15:50] <MoL0ToV> model is asus k56ca
[15:51] <Cheri703> MoL0ToV: you might try a combination of xbindkeys and xev
[15:51] <MoL0ToV> howto?
[15:51] <Cheri703> that's how I made my mouse have custom buttons. you set up a config file for xbindkeys and the "action" is the xev command
[15:51] <Cheri703> one sec
[15:52] <Cheri703> actually it's xte with xbindkeys sorry
[15:52] <Cheri703> so the context here is referring to mouse customizing, but you can use it for keyboard clicks as well
[15:53] <Cheri703> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1905338
[15:53] <Cheri703> https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=99344
[15:53] <Cheri703> oh, that's arch
[15:53] <Cheri703> but still
[15:54] <Cheri703> similar idea because it's xbindkeys and xte
[15:54] <Cheri703> example from my config:
[15:54] <Cheri703> "xte 'keydown Shift_L' 'keydown Control_L' 'keydown Alt_L' 'key c' 'keyup Shift_L' 'keyup Control_L' 'keyup Alt_L'"
[15:54] <Cheri703> b:12 + release
[15:54] <Cheri703> "xte 'keydown Control_L' 'key c' 'keyup Control_L'"
[15:54] <Cheri703> b:10

[16:27] <genoobie> hey all
[16:27] <baizon> hi
[16:27] <genoobie> just installed xubuntu'
[16:27] <genoobie> porblem with getting the wlan going
[16:27] <genoobie> not sure how to proceed
[16:30] <GridCube> !details | genoobie
[16:30] <ubottu> genoobie: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[16:31] <genoobie> sorry, I should have been more specific GridCube
[16:31] <GridCube> np
[16:31] <genoobie> okay, I am a bit of a noob
[16:31] <genoobie> I have a PCMCIA wlan card
[16:31] <genoobie> it's a broadcom
[16:32] <genoobie> it was not "recognized" on install
[16:32] <GridCube> do lspci and paste the part of bcm blah blah bla
[16:32] <genoobie> network controller Broadcom BCM4306 blah (rev 02)
[16:33] <GridCube> lol, blah
[16:33] <Cheri703> genoobie: did you try the "additional drivers" thing? I had to google where to find it in xubuntu
[16:33] <Cheri703> it's under "software sources" in the settings manager
[16:33] <GridCube> just copy paste the actual result so google is more friendly
[16:33] <genoobie> 802.11b/g wireless lan
[16:33] <genoobie> see I only have wireless
[16:33] <Cheri703> ah, nvm
[16:33] <genoobie> so I can't copy and paste unfortunately
[16:33] <GridCube> oh
[16:33] <GridCube> correct
[16:33] <genoobie> but the detail is there
[16:34] <genoobie> yes, on additional drivers
[16:34] <genoobie> it's not listed
[16:34] <GridCube> genoobie, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx
[16:34] <genoobie> can I use the install cd for that?
[16:34] <Cheri703> :/ might need a wired connection to get it
[16:34] <genoobie> oh, hrm
[16:34] <genoobie> let me see if I can get on
[16:34] <genoobie> brb
[17:02] <Guest30042> Hi :) I wanted to use Xubuntu on my thinkpad and everything is working nicely. However, when using my dock + external monitor(s) things are really getting annoying. (I know I could use scripts and key shortcuts etc, but thats just not really comfortable) So my question is: is it possible to somehow use the "auto-setting-stuff" like in Unity/gnome3/etc?
[17:02] <holstein> auto setting stuff?
[17:03] <holstein> what is happening? and what do you want to have happen?.. you want to mirror the display when you plug it in? what are you calling a dock??
[17:03] <baizon> Guest30042: you can always write / get event scripts. That can be one sollution
[17:03] <genoobie> okay
[17:04] <genoobie> I'm back :)
[17:04] <genoobie> I tried additional driver
[17:04] <Cheri703> Guest30042: I don't know that it's the "official" recommendation, but this worked for me overall (some panel things that are not behaving how I want, but overall it's been fine) http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/how-to-use-multiple-monitors-in-xubuntu.html Disclaimer: you can't easily downgrade if you upgrade to xfce 4.12 (I tried that last night, it didn't work well, had to go back up)
[17:04] <genoobie> I tried the additional drivers option
[17:04] <Cheri703> genoobie: any luck?
[17:04] <genoobie> well it's been saying "download and installing" driver for about 5 min
[17:05] <genoobie> wonder if I should cancel
[17:05] <Cheri703> yeah, it took a long time on mine when I tried to do a video driver, felt like too long, but it eventually did it
[17:05] <genoobie> okay, will wait
[17:05] <genoobie> it's an older system
[17:05] <genoobie> I really like the distro so far
[17:05] <genoobie> seems pretty peppy on a PIII 800 with 384 Ram
[17:06] <genoobie> I think I can convince my family to switch
[17:06] <genoobie> with this OS
[17:06] <genoobie> mostly winxp users here
[17:08] <genoobie> Cheri703, any way to tell if it is "working"
[17:08] <Guest30042> Cheri703: Hm, i read something about better support in 4.12, but i think thats not really what i want. => When I put my laptop in the dock, I want it to automatically switch to the external one and disable the laptop one. => when pulling it back out, it should reverse that. AND also resitze the wondows. (from 27" to 12" some windows just get "lost"
[17:09] <Cheri703> ah, as far as automatic I don't know :s (also what thinkpad do you have? I've been eyeing them)
[17:09] <Guest30042> Cheri703: I'm using a x220
[17:09] <Cheri703> ah, ok
[17:10] <genoobie> hrm
[17:10] <genoobie> seems like an unbelievably long time
[17:10] <Cheri703> genoobie: I'm not sure how to tell, sorry :/
[17:11] <genoobie> okay, going to go out for a bit
[17:11] <genoobie> bbl
[17:11] <Guest30042> Cheri703: atm I'm running elementary OS on it and docking etcetc is just wonderfull, however I'm missing features (overall) and wan't to switch to something new
[17:12] <Cheri703> ah, ok
[17:16] <genoobie> still load
[17:16] <genoobie> loading that
[17:16] <genoobie> urgh still loading that is
[17:16] <genoobie> there's something wrong
[17:16] <Cheri703> yeah, possibly restart and try again? not sure :s
[17:17] <genoobie> yep
[18:00] <holstein> q: i add xfce4-cpufreq-plugin, and added it to the panel.. what do i do to "juice it up" so that it can control the cpu governor settings?
[19:59] <hhhzzzain> hello, when you click on the battery icon "power icon" with left-click. is it suppose suppose to expand a window showing more information? or does it only open a notification window?
[20:12] <hhhzzzain> anyone there?
[20:12] <hhhzzzain> need someone to quickly confirm something.
[20:12] <hhhzzzain> when you click on the battery icon "power icon" with left-click. is it suppose suppose to expand a window showing more information? or does it only open a notification window?
[20:26] <Fieldy> if I create /etc/network/if-up.d/zzz-firewalling-and-forwarding with some custom iptables commands, they should get executed last when networking comes up right? I did exactly that and even the exact same commands for another install however on this latest one it's not getting executed, or something is overriding it later. it is mode 755 like the others in that directory
[20:40] <holstein> hhhzzzain: i dont have any good test cases for that right now.. what is the issue?
[20:44] <hhhzzzain> holstein, just wanted to know if the power icon when clicked expands or opens a windows showing status of batter, time left, brightness etc? or it does nothing?
[20:45] <hhhzzzain> only if i move the mouse over it, a black notification appears telling those information but I can not change brightness that way (I have to press the function key and use arrows key).
[20:45] <holstein> hhhzzzain: i have jupiter installed here, and the other machine i have is a desktop.. the ones handy, that are running xfce
[20:46] <hhhzzzain> my comment is why does xubuntu does not have a brightness slider by default?
[20:46] <holstein> hhhzzzain: not sure... i think its because its challenging to provide that for all different types of hardwrae
[20:46] <hhhzzzain> you have to go and install the "power-manager-plugins" after researching about it then "add to panel" brightness slider.
[20:46] <holstein> hhhzzzain: you might have to install that, but others may not
[20:48] <hhhzzzain> holstein, also when you press "restart", does it restart completely for you?
[20:48] <holstein> it? meaning the machine?
[20:48] <holstein> i would say, usually.. some hardware cases it doesnt do anything
[20:48] <holstein> depends on the driver support
[20:51] <hhhzzzain> because when I press restart, no what distro, it can not restart, it hangs with the blank black screen, I have to manually hold the power button to shut down again and start.
[20:51] <holstein> you can usually add in whatever you want/need.. with FOSS hhhzzzain , the answer is almost always "yes you can", but the "how you do it" can be challeing
[20:51] <alegen> hey anyone who has experience with davmail?
[20:52] <hhhzzzain> not me alege,
[20:52] <hhhzzzain> alegen.
[20:52] <holstein> hhhzzzain: in a lot of ways, linux is linux, and we all kind of have similare hardware support, or access to it
[20:53] <hhhzzzain> i understand.
[20:53] <hhhzzzain> for being practical, you have to resort to what gets the job done (windows) but you have to promote the better future (open source).
[20:53] <holstein> sometimes, trying a proprietary graphics driver can really make things easier.. or more complicated
[20:54] <holstein> well, its the drivers that "get the job done"
[20:54] <holstein> the manufacturer can provide you a driver for whatever operating system you choose to run
[20:54] <holstein> could be the best drivers are written for windows... the drivers that work best with your hardware.. but that has nothing to do with windows
[20:55] <hhhzzzain> i understand. but what i am saying is, for the end user who have less experience, do not expect them to rush over to foss and be happy.
[20:56] <hhhzzzain> a lot of :(
[20:56] <holstein> i dont expect anything.. im just saying, dont expect hardware to work when the manufacterer doesnt support it
[20:56] <hhhzzzain> for example, recently i have switch from firefox to chrome because firefox kept crashing because of flash.
[20:57] <holstein> all of the manufacturers are free to, and encouraged to write drivers for whatever platform
[20:57] <holstein> hhhzzzain: that is *not* an analog
[20:57] <holstein> flash is however not well supported on linux
[20:57] <holstein> i switched to chrome as well, but that has nothing to do with firefox..
[20:57] <holstein> they dont package (nor are they allowed to) their own flash like chrome does
[20:57] <hhhzzzain> you switched for different reason.
[20:58] <holstein> i know that flash is what it is. and it not well supported
[20:58] <holstein> i switched years ago with firefox was slow, but its fast again.. and flash is still not great for us
[20:59] <holstein> but, flash is always able, and welcome to be properly implemented
[20:59] <hhhzzzain> I did not make my point clear, but you get it.
[20:59] <holstein> hhhzzzain: if you bought a system76 machine for example that comes with ubuntu, all would just work for you.. just as the windows install
[20:59] <hhhzzzain> I know.
[20:59] <holstein> should you use xubuntu? if you want.. will it work? if there are drivers
[21:00] <holstein> no one "expects" you to switch though... especially not the manufacturer of your hardware, which provided you drivers for windows
[21:00] <holstein> can you us xubuntu on your machine? sure.. but the experience might be challenging depeding on hardware support
[21:01] <holstein> that really goes for *any* operating system the manufacturer doesnt support
[21:02] <hhhzzzain> and here is the one of the key stages. Unless you can get computer manufacturers to support, you will continue to have problems. But the end users do not know about gnu/linux and would not know that they need to buy those computers. They go to a store and buy a laptop (supported for windows) and later they find out about ubuntu (for example).
[21:03] <holstein> hhhzzzain: they can support it... and many do
[21:03] <hhhzzzain> yes as linux have gained popularity.
[21:03] <holstein> hhhzzzain: you can buy a linux system from resellers such as system76
[21:03] <hhhzzzain> what about dell, hp, acer, asus?
[21:04] <hhhzzzain> they did not decide to randomly start building computers that support both windows 8 and linux.
[21:04] <holstein> hhhzzzain: i bought a linux machine from hp and one from asus.. and i have seen them from dell, and they still do
[21:04] <hhhzzzain> someone had to pressure them, show the,.
[21:04] <hhhzzzain> were they originally windows machines?
[21:04] <holstein> hhhzzzain: no. i purchases them from the manufacturer with linux
[21:04] <hhhzzzain> did windows come installed
[21:04] <holstein> hhhzzzain: no
[21:04] <holstein> hhhzzzain: no windows.. just linux
[21:05] <hhhzzzain> see but you were aware.
[21:05] <hhhzzzain> most people are not.
[21:05] <holstein> hhhzzzain: ?.. you can be too
[21:05] <hhhzzzain> I am also.
[21:05] <hhhzzzain> what about my father??
[21:05] <hhhzzzain> does he know what I know?
[21:05] <holstein> i dont disagree that the end user can have a challenge, but there is nothing we can do here about it
[21:05] <holstein> we are not allowed to have the ability to support some hardware
[21:06] <hhhzzzain> yes we two can not and not in this channel.
[21:06] <holstein> hhhzzzain: not in the linux community in many places with certain hardware
[21:07] <hhhzzzain> so what is your point?
[21:07] <holstein> hhhzzzain: ?.. just that.. that you might not get support for you hardware from the linux community
[21:07] <holstein> you might not be able to
[21:07] <holstein> its not that we dont want to.. it might be that we cant
[21:08] <hhhzzzain> my point is, that someone has to work with manufacturers (canonical).
[21:08] <hhhzzzain> I understand you completely but we are talking about two different but related things.
[21:08] <hhhzzzain> :)
[21:08] <holstein> hhhzzzain: im sure they are tryiing
[21:08] <hhhzzzain> I know.
[21:09] <holstein> hhhzzzain: and they do in some cases, but that doesnt mean that it will always work.. if the manufacturer doesnt want to
[21:09] <holstein> hhhzzzain: i would contact canonical for that, or /join the #xubuntu-offtopic channel to discuss
[21:10] <hhhzzzain> you did get me at all.
[21:11] <hhhzzzain> I am not complaining. I am just point the importance of a big player/organization such as canonical or any other and their role in foss
[21:11] <hhhzzzain> well that is settled.
[21:11] <bool> why isnt the grub boot loader updated to show Xubuntu instead of Ubuntu?
[21:12] <holstein> hhhzzzain: i dont think so, but you are welcome any ot channels...
[21:12] <holstein> bool: xubuntu *is* ubuntu
[21:12] <holstein> bool: what is the issue eactly?
[21:15] <hhhzzzain> it will not show "xubuntu".
[21:16] <hhhzzzain> it will show "ubuntu" because it is ubuntu with xfce desktop and some modification.
[21:16] <hhhzzzain> so they decided that is better to show as "ubuntu" on the grub menu.
[21:17] <bool> yeah, ok
[21:17] <bool> i can live with it
[22:26] <souperk> hello, I have just installed xubuntu. How come when the system boots, until the desktop
[22:26] <souperk> there's only a black screen?
[22:26] <souperk> I would like to see... the boot text... how can I do that?
[22:27] <souperk> i mean, all the console messages showing at boot, before the desktop comes up.
[22:28] <recon_lap> souperk: whats the last thing you see before the blank screen ?
[22:28] <recon_lap> souperk: and i think pressing delete will show the boot messages
[22:29] <souperk> when I turn on my laptop
[22:29] <souperk> i have the grub bootloader,
[22:29] <souperk> then I select my xubuntu installation partition
[22:29] <souperk> and the system boots up...
[22:30] <souperk> correctly! but I would love to see all the console txt while booting
[22:30] <souperk> how can I make it permanent?
[22:33] <recon_lap> souperk: you probably have to change it in your grub file /etc/default/grub
[22:34] <recon_lap> souperk: maybe add SPLASH="no"
[22:34] <souperk> oh...can I edit that file directly from the file mananger in the desktop?
[22:35] <recon_lap> souperk: no, and it's an important system file. you could break your boot menu
[22:36] <souperk> how can I edit it safely, then?
[22:41] <recon_lap> souperk: backup the file before changing, having a rescue boot method. and then use sudo nano to edit the file and hope it works right
[22:42] <souperk> probably you're right, as I clicked on it in the file manager with the right key of the mouse
[22:42] <souperk> it asks me to open it with leafpad...
[22:42] <recon_lap> souperk: open it, if you're not sudo'd you cannot change it
[22:45] <souperk> yes, when I tried to save it it tells (impossible to write)
[22:46] <recon_lap> souperk: you see where it set splash
[22:50] <souperk> yes i am editing the file with sudo nano command now
[22:50] <souperk> i deleted the splash thing
[22:51] <souperk> now i do a 'sudo update-grub' as its written on top of that file
[22:51] <souperk> and lets see...
[22:53] <recon_lap> sry, try add splash=verbose console=tty1 loglevel=6
[22:53] <souperk> it did not work :(
[22:54] <souperk> i just rebooted and still black screen, after deleting splash before quiet.
[22:54] <souperk> do I have to add a new line in grub file?
[22:54] <souperk> with what you wrote?
[22:56] <recon_lap> souperk: if grub was GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset" , you should remove the quite and splash setting and add settings, GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash=verbose console=tty1 loglevel=6  nomodeset"
[22:56] <recon_lap> souperk: but i'm not sure if that will work.
[22:57] <souperk> the line is the one you copied except for nomodeset
[22:57] <souperk> I dont have the nomodeset voice
[22:57] <souperk> i have just GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"
[22:58] <recon_lap> souperk: yep, grub can be different for different computers
[22:58] <souperk> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="splash=verbose console=tty1 loglevel=6"
[22:58] <souperk> can i try that? without nomodeset?
[22:58] <recon_lap> souperk: sure, hope nothing breaks :)
[22:59] <souperk> how can I make the # symbol?
[22:59] <souperk> I dont have it on my laptop keyboard... :/
[22:59] <recon_lap> here, use this one # ;)
[23:00] <souperk> i want to make it in grub
[23:00] <souperk> and put it in front of the original line, to still keep it
[23:00] <souperk> I can't use the mouse in the terminal to copy and paste :(
[23:00] <recon_lap> souperk: sure you can
[23:00] <recon_lap> souperk: right click, paste
[23:01] <souperk> oh!! you're right
[23:01] <souperk> it works
[23:01] <souperk> silly me
[23:01] <recon_lap> souperk: remember that when you reading online tuts :)
[23:02] <souperk> :))
[23:03] <souperk> ok, modifications done
[23:03] <souperk> i am updating grub, then I will reboot and lets see if this time will work
[23:04] <souperk> something already changed
[23:05] <souperk> as I noticed that turning off the system
[23:05] <souperk> shows console messages
[23:05] <souperk> before NOT
[23:05] <recon_lap> souperk: thats what you want isn't it
[23:05] <souperk> :(((((((((
[23:05] <souperk> booting
[23:05] <souperk> but still black! :((
[23:05] <souperk> I wonder why :((
[23:06] <souperk> I got a few lines just now, right before the desktop showed up
[23:06] <souperk> but at the beginning all black as before
[23:09] <souperk> im reading somewhere else that if I just modify that line with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=
[23:09] <souperk> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=
[23:09] <souperk> and nothing after the =
[23:09] <souperk> would work!
[23:09] <souperk> can you confirm?
[23:10] <recon_lap> souperk: no, but makes sense as it just had quite nosplash in there before
[23:10] <souperk> i red it here:  http://askubuntu.com/questions/248/how-can-i-show-or-hide-boot-messages-when-ubuntu-starts
[23:10] <souperk> its worth a try...
[23:13] <souperk> didn't work either :/
[23:13] <souperk> it seems that there's no way :/
[23:15] <recon_lap> I'd have to reboot to work this out more, and that not practical
[23:16] <souperk> no worries :/
[23:16] <souperk> I thought it was simple to do this thing...
[23:17] <souperk> as i remember when I last used linux long long time ago
[23:17] <souperk> the console messages were enabled by default
[23:20] <souperk> another try is GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="noplymouth"
[23:20] <recon_lap> souperk: welcome to linux on the desktop :)
[23:20] <souperk> :))
[23:24] <entreri> hello, so I downloaded Lubuntu because it is a lightweight OS, but I'm not satisfied with it I find it buggy and still lacking in Graphic Interface options. For instance, I need to change some mouse settings and the graphic options are very limited, to change the scrolling behavior from right edge to two-fingers scrolling I need to edit some files using CLI, is Xubuntu more advanced
[23:24] <entreri> ?
[23:24] <entreri> in its GUI
[23:24] <Cheri703> entreri: yes
[23:24] <souperk> i had the same issue before! i installed lubuntu and immediately formatted the partition to install xubuntu!
[23:24] <souperk> do it and you wont regret
[23:25] <entreri> nice, I had to be sure before downloading it 'cause my data is limited : P
[23:25] <souperk> i couldnt install the latest ubuntu because my laptop was not "good" enough for it :/
[23:26] <souperk> xubuntu apparently is
[23:27] <recon_lap> entreri: xfce is good, still got a couple of glitches. but nothing major
[23:32] <Siilence> I think it became a lot better with the latest release of xubuntu.
[23:32] <Siilence> Quite a lift.
[23:32] <Siilence> (imo)
[23:32] <souperk> recon, probably i have found a solution to the console messages!
[23:33] <recon_lap> pressing esc maybe :P
[23:33] <souperk> nah :)
[23:33] <souperk> it seems that we forgot the most important thing!
[23:33] <souperk> uncomment the 'GRUB_TERMINAL=console' line :D
[23:35] <recon_lap> hmm, that seems like it would help, I'll have to try remember that in future
[23:35] <souperk> yes it helps
[23:35] <souperk> the only problem is that now
[23:35] <souperk> I see the console messages (problem solved)
[23:35] <souperk> but not as good as before...
[23:35] <souperk> i mean.. the fonts are bigger!
[23:35] <souperk> even grub shows up with bigger fonts
[23:36] <recon_lap> souperk: think you might need to buy a mac :)
[23:36] <souperk> but better than nothing :))
[23:43] <souperk> ** off to sleep **
[23:43] <souperk> thanks for the help!! :)
