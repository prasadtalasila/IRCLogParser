[03:32] <mrspinx> Hi I am looking for the latest builds for the nexus7 I am looking at the git repository and I am thinking of installing the stock image
[03:51] <jon654> does anyone know how to put Windows Ce Or UBUNTU on a Generic Android 2.2 Tablet (it doesnt have sync cable, but does have microsd, and is a tablet, not a netbook AKA Eken m009s or WM8650)?

[03:56] <jon654> does anyone know how to put Windows Ce Or UBUNTU on a Generic Android 2.2 Tablet (it doesnt have sync cable, but does have microsd, and is a tablet, not a netbook AKA Eken m009s or WM8650)?
[03:58] <jon654> How can I install ubuntu on an android device?
[04:16] <XorA> jon654: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zpwebsites.linuxonandroid&hl=en ??
[04:17] <jon654> Yes XorA, but I want to completely take off android and put on ubuntu instead
[04:18] <XorA> jon654: then you probably need to compile your own kernel and install it, then I would point it to the SD card with a Ubuntu FS on it
[04:18] <jon654> please explain
[04:18] <XorA> jon654: without a sync cable though installing a custom kernel could be difficult
[04:19] <jon654> when i have installed android updates, it boots off the sd card, but when using and .iso extracted, it wont boot from the sd
[04:19] <jon654> XorA
[04:20] <XorA> jon654: I suspect this task is beyong a beginner, and each device is different so I couldnt give you a guide!
[04:21] <jon654> i just bought the cheapest chinese tablet with two names, EKEN M009s and MID WM8640
[04:21] <jon654> it had 256MB Ram, 4GB Disk Space, Android 2.2, webcam
[04:21] <jon654> and it is called generic
[04:22] <XorA> jon654: do you have a local LUG?
[04:22] <jon654> what is LUG
[04:22] <XorA> Linux Users Group
[04:22] <jon654> Whats that?
[04:23] <XorA> bunch of geeks get together drink beers and solve issues like this
[04:23] <jon654> no
[04:23] <jon654> I have had ubuntu in the past, but now i want it on my tablet
[04:23] <XorA> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group
[04:24] <lilstevie> 256MB ram will not be a nice experience though
[04:24] <XorA> trouble is here there is very little likely hood of finding someone with same tablet
[04:24] <jon654> oh ok
[04:24] <XorA> lilstevie: is the man if you buy a Transformer :-D
[04:24] <jon654> I have had 1GB ram and it was super fast
[04:25] <jon654> so 256Ram for a tablet should be fast for ubuntu
[04:25] <jon654> just slow for android
[04:26] <lilstevie> hehe
[04:26] <lilstevie> jon654: not really
[04:26] <lilstevie> I have ported ubuntu to 3 tablets now
[04:27] <lilstevie> 1 with 512MB ram and 2 with 1GB
[04:27] <jon654> could you help me port it onto mine?
[04:27] <lilstevie> and 512 is painful
[04:27] <XorA> 256 is like 1999 memory levels :-D
[04:27] <jon654> i really don't care about speed for what I'm using it for
[04:27] <jon654> :)
[04:27] <lilstevie> it isn't speed
[04:27] <XorA> just loading firefox takes 100+M
[04:27] <lilstevie> I call the device with 512MB RAM Crashy McCrashCrash
[04:28] <jon654> Ok, but it's good enough for me
[04:28] <lilstevie> cause LowMem killer
[04:28] <jon654> hahaha!
[04:28] <jon654> :)
[04:28] <jon654> can you tell me how to port it to my droid tab?
[04:28] <lilstevie> open more than 3 or 4 tabs in Chromium of Firefox and say goodbye to Chromium or Firefox
[04:28] <lilstevie> with great difficulty if you have no idea what you are doing
[04:29] <lilstevie> you need to be able to compile a kernel
[04:29] <jon654> how can i do that?
[04:29] <jon654> I have the iso ready
[04:29] <lilstevie> and be comfortable with flashing it/configuring it
[04:29] <lilstevie> and no iso is going to help
[04:29] <jon654> i have the Ubuntu12.10.iso
[04:29] <jon654> but what should i do to port it over to the tablet?
[04:29]  * lilstevie walks away
[04:30] <jon654> lilstevie?
[04:31] <jon654> hello?
[04:35] <jon654> Has anyone else ever ported Ubuntu onto an android tablet? by taking off android and putting on ubuntu?
[04:42] <lilstevie> jon654: ubuntu will not run on your tablet
[04:45] <lilstevie> the tablet runs an ARM9 (ARMv5) SoC, ubuntu only supports SoCs that are ARMv7
=== jon654 is now known as jon655
[04:51] <jon655> hello?
[05:30] <jon655> lilstevie, what about Ubuntu 8?
[05:40] <lilstevie> jon655: past EOL
[05:40] <jon655> 8.04, im downloading it from Ubuntus site right now
[05:44] <jon655> lilstevie
[05:49] <lilstevie> let me guess you downloaded an iso
[05:52] <jon655> maybe....
[05:52] <jon655> yes i did
[05:53] <jon655> lilstevie
[05:53] <lilstevie> arm versions of ubuntu do not ship in ISOs
[05:54] <lilstevie> you are just randomly downloading isos thinking it will work, yet you haven't even investigated compiling a kernel
[05:56] <sim590> Hey! Anyone's got an idea for helping me about the post I've just made on: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1683145&page=57 (Jhinta kernel for lilstevie ubuntu)
[05:58] <lilstevie> sim590: a few things
[05:59] <sim590> yes yes, I'm quiet and listening
[05:59] <lilstevie> apply_binaries does not register the binaries correctly as far as ubuntu expects (with update-alternatives), jhintas kernel doesn't support the latest release of tegra drivers this is why the package didn't seem to work
[05:59] <lilstevie> unity does not work at this time with tegra drivers
[06:00] <sim590> ok, so I'm better with lxde I guess
[06:00] <lilstevie> also I would advise caution when using jhintas kernel, it is a fluke that it even works
[06:01] <sim590> I posted the link to the kernel I use. I don't know if it's jintha's kernel really..
[06:01] <jon655> lilstevie
[06:01] <jon655> i am using this kernel now
[06:01] <jon655> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=FfbnpfMGTAU
[06:01] <jon655> the one he listed
[06:01] <jon655> i'll see if it works
[06:01] <jon655> 14 minutes left to extract
[06:03] <lilstevie> jon655: <lilstevie> arm versions of ubuntu do not ship in ISOs
[06:04] <jon655> i know
[06:04] <jon655> it wasnt an iso
[06:05] <lilstevie> then why did you say yes when I asked you if you downloaded an iso
[06:05] <jon655> that was before this one
[06:05] <lilstevie> and more importantly what did you download
[06:05] <jon655> It's Arch Linux for ARM
[06:07] <lilstevie> and that kernel is for your device yes? cause in that video isn't it a different device
[06:08] <jon655> i believe so
[06:08] <jon655> It is the netbook version of my tablet
[06:09] <lilstevie> then that is not the same thing
[06:09] <jon655> With the same WM8650
[06:09] <jon655> It contains the same processor as my tablet
[06:10] <lilstevie> that means nothing
[06:10] <jon655> Its the same android just with a touch screen and with a keyboard attached
[06:11] <lilstevie> Sasmsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, Asus Transformer TF101, Motorola Xoom, Toshiba Thrive, Acer A500 all use the same Tegra2 cpu yet each has a different kernel, why? cause they are not the same device
[06:12] <jon655> They are both Wonder Media Tablets! Mine has two names, EKEN M009s, and Wonder Media WM8650... This is by the same people!
[06:13] <jon655> with just 2 differences
[06:13] <lilstevie> ok,
[06:14] <jon655> in the description he writes tablets for the download, not netbook
[06:14] <lilstevie> Asus Transformer prime and Asus Nexus 7 are by the same people yet run different kernels
[06:14] <jon655> in the description he writes tablets for the download, not netbook
[06:14] <lilstevie> point is be prepared that the kernel may not work
[06:14] <lilstevie> cause arm kernels tend to be horribly device specific
[06:17] <jon655> k

[10:35] <teiler> pandaboard: how do I restore my previous kernel if the new one doesn't boot?
[10:55] <infinity> teiler: The previous one should be on the SD card's first parition backed up as uImage.bak and uInitrd.bak
[10:55] <infinity> teiler: You can swap them back and it should boot fine (assuming this was done by flash-kernel)
[10:56] <teiler> ok, but how?
[10:57] <infinity> Well, either on another machine with an SD reader, or interrupt the uBoot process and do it by hand.
[10:58] <infinity> Running something like: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1527006/
[10:58] <infinity> (This is what boot.scr on the SD card runs in uBoot automatically, but with .bak added to the two image files)
[10:58] <lilstevie> I hope building for ubuntu phone isn't as head-deskish as building desktop applications for windows rt is
[10:59] <infinity> lilstevie: Well, it's just Ubuntu on the underside.
[10:59] <lilstevie> infinity: and windows rt is windows on the underside
[10:59] <lilstevie> :p
[10:59] <infinity> lilstevie: Now, I'm still not sure where things will go as far as "app frameworks" and "official APIs", but for people doing native work, it's just Ubuntu.
[11:00] <infinity> lilstevie: Well, I a bit more "just Ubuntu" than RT is "just Windows".  As in, it's the same archive repository, the same binaries.  Self-hosting, you can build natively, no need for cross sandboxes and voodoo.
[11:00] <teiler> infinity: thanks. I was looking for a command reference for this shell. Is it uboot?
[11:00] <infinity> s/I a/it's a/
[11:00] <infinity> teiler: It's uBoot, yes.
[11:01] <lilstevie> infinity: windows rt doesn't require too much voodoo, they just haven't offered the framework libraries in the sdk
[11:01] <infinity> teiler: It does have a help command though I suppose the help is a bit arcane.
[11:01] <lilstevie> that is pretty simple
[11:01] <infinity> lilstevie: Ahh, yeah, I haven't looked at RT, due to a lack of carefactor.
[11:01] <infinity> lilstevie: But in our case, it's all there.  Or, will be once the UI stuff lands in the archive.
[11:01] <lilstevie> infinity: sadly native compilation on ubuntu phone will solve 99.9% of the issues Visual Studio presents
[11:02] <teiler> well, what puzzled me was the device taxanomy
[11:02] <infinity> (And, of course, we're working hard on making or cross-building story less crap too, if you've noticed but, still, the joy of a self-hosting platform and ARM devices being pretty speedy these days is that you can just go native and it works)
[11:03] <lilstevie> infinity: with SoCs like S4 and beyond (aarch64, big.LITTLE, etc) building on device isn't scary anymore
[11:04] <infinity> lilstevie: I've been saying that since the Cortex-A8.
[11:04] <infinity> lilstevie: But yes, the situation just keeps improving.  A15s are really impressing me a lot more than I thought they would when I first saw them on paper.
[11:05] <lilstevie> infinity: My dual-core S4 does not perform much worse than my quad-core A9
[11:05] <lilstevie> which is a damn good sign
[11:06] <infinity> And someone announced an 8-core big.LITTLE at CES.  Forgot who already.
[11:06] <RaYmAn> Samsung
[11:06] <RaYmAn> Exynos 5 'octo'
[11:06] <infinity> 4xA7, 4xA15.  Curious to see how it'll work in practice, rather than theory.
[11:06] <infinity> RaYmAn: Right, thanks.
[11:06] <infinity> Getting old, trivia just slips in one ear and out the other these days.
[11:06] <lilstevie> that will be interesting
[11:07] <lilstevie> I didn't really pay much attention to CES
[11:07] <lilstevie> most of it was pretty boring crap
[11:07] <infinity> Then again, even if we're all still scrambling to make big.LITTLE scheduling as awesome as possible, just firing it up with the 4xA15s and ignoring the A7s will be fine for my use cases. :P
[11:07] <lilstevie> heh
[11:08] <lilstevie> what would really make my day is being able to turn on both CPU Complexes at once
[11:08] <infinity> Most of the big.LITTLE people I've talked to have mentioned that as a nice-to-have goal.
[11:08] <infinity> For people like me who don't give a shit about power and just want as much juice as possible.
[11:09] <infinity> But, it makes SMP scheduling a bit of a nightmare to have mismatched CPUs.
[11:09] <infinity> Cause timeslices are no longer equal units.
[11:10] <infinity> And, to be fair, the A7 is intentionally so much slower than the A15 that you might not really care about the modest performance boost anyway.
[11:10] <infinity> Especially after you factor in the complexity overhead, plus the development time that went into the shiny. :P
[11:10] <lilstevie> Given that they should be living on 2 different buses (with one central) that you may be able to async between the complexes while maintaining SMP in each complex
[11:12] <infinity> I do kinda wonder why they didn't just go with big.BIGGER as the model.
[11:12] <lilstevie> that would be cool
[11:12] <lilstevie> but probably power profile
[11:12] <infinity> (As in, a bunch of identical cores, but recommend that you turn all but one off and frequency scale that one into the ground)
[11:12] <sim590> anyone got an idea why linux would put a filesystem in readonly? I got a guess: dpkg tried to access to some corrupted file. Seeing it was corrupted, linux put the FS in read-only FS. Does this make sense?
[11:13] <infinity> But I get the impression the A7 part itself is just plain designed to be far more efficient than the A15.
[11:13] <lilstevie> trying to make little as power efficient as possible
[11:13] <infinity> sim590: dmesg may give some clues.
[11:13] <lilstevie> sim590: RO is considered safe but yeah check dmesg
[11:14] <infinity> sim590: But as a general rule, if your filesystem throws errors, your kernel will remount it RO to prevent you from damaging it further until you can sort it out.
[11:15] <infinity> lilstevie: I do look forward to big.LITTLE in practice on smart phones, though.  I dream of a day when my smart phone can go two days without charging. :P
[11:15] <infinity> (Who else misses all the old Nokia feature phones that went a week?  Seems like forever ago now)
[11:15] <lilstevie> infinity: agreed
[11:15] <lilstevie> I miss feature phones for that reason
[11:16] <sim590> thanks guys. I'll try to trigger the error again and look dmegs
[11:17] <lilstevie> I miss the good old days of "oh, my phone is bleeping at me, what do you know it has been like 8 days since I charged it"
[11:17] <lilstevie> then as phones got more advanced and their battery lives started dropping I thought, ok fair enough, give it time for the battery tech to catch up. Now here we are years later and stuck at 1, maybe 2 days if you are lucky
[11:20] <infinity> Maybe I should throw my SIM in my old Sony W700 and see how long I can survive without a web browser and apps.
[11:20] <infinity> At least it was a good music player.
[11:20] <infinity> And it probably wouldn't take long to relearn T9.
[11:21] <sim590> infinity,lilstevie: Thanks for your advice guys
[11:22] <infinity> Oh, except I'm on a cheap carrier than doesn't actually offer GSM service, so I'd be perpetually roaming.  That would be problematic. :P
[11:23] <lilstevie> heh sometimes I consider trying to find a nokia 1100 again, I used to consistently get 8-10 days from that thing
[11:24] <infinity> I probably still have my 8860 in a box somewhere.
[11:26] <lilstevie> heh
[11:26] <infinity> Oh, wait, no, it was an 8850.
[11:26] <infinity> The 8860 was the silly North American TDMA model, and I had that phone in Australia.
[11:26] <lilstevie> ah
[11:27] <lilstevie> as long as it is not TDMA it will probably still work here
[11:27] <infinity> The 8850 is GSM 900/1800
[11:28] <infinity> Should work on a fair few carriers still.
[11:28] <lilstevie> yeah that would work just fine here
[11:28] <lilstevie> on my carrier
[11:29] <infinity> It was pretty, too.  I've mostly forgotten how much design went into these things.
[11:29] <infinity> Before we all started carrying black rectangles.
[11:29] <lilstevie> yeah
[11:29] <infinity> "The phone's memory can store up to 250 names and 50 calendar notes. SMS messages can only be stored on the SIM card."
[11:30] <infinity> ^-- How did that not drive me insane?
[11:30] <lilstevie> oh...my...god that just reminded me
[11:30] <infinity> I have tens of thousands of text messages on my current phone, that wouldn't fit on a SIM. :P
[11:30] <lilstevie> of the hell
[11:30] <lilstevie> "Your phones simcard is full please delete some text messages"
[11:30] <infinity> *grin*
[11:30] <infinity> The good old days.
[11:31] <lilstevie> yep
[11:31] <lilstevie> back in the day when having 30 text messages was it
[11:33] <infinity> I suspect I spent more time talking to people in person back then.
[11:33] <infinity> Yay, progress.
[11:35] <lilstevie> yeah
[11:35] <lilstevie> or talking on the phone
[11:35] <lilstevie> now days it is all text
[11:35] <lilstevie> I know my old phones spent a lot more time against my ear than new ones
[11:36] <lilstevie> the new ones*
[12:20] <teiler> infinity: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1527006/ root=UUID=c8fabf2c-f023-41d8-83bd-98dcde49d64f won't work …
[12:21] <infinity> teiler: Erm, yeah, that's my root device, not yours. :P
[12:22] <infinity> teiler: Is your root on the SD card or an external USB drive?
[12:22] <teiler> SD card
[12:23] <infinity> teiler: You'll want something like "root=/dev/mmcblk0p2" probably.
[12:26] <lilstevie> hah
[12:27] <lilstevie> you can probably also get your uuid from the boot.scr/boot.cmd on your u-boot partition
[12:28] <infinity> lilstevie: Yeah, but if he could get at his SD card, he could also just swap uImage and uImage.bak.  I get the impression he's not flush with non-Panda SD readers.
[12:28] <lilstevie> ah
[12:29] <lilstevie> I thought u-boot had a cat like command though
[12:29] <infinity> Plus, mmcblk0p2 is a hell of a lot easier to type than a UUID. ;)
[12:29] <lilstevie> true
[12:29] <lilstevie> also that said, I do only have 1 device with u-boot and I don't tend to poke around its console very often
[12:31] <infinity> Yeah, I can't find a catish thing in the first reference sheet I googled.
[12:31] <infinity> You can fatls directories, but no fatcat or similar.
[12:32] <infinity> Shame, cause fatcat would be an awesome command name.
[12:32] <infinity> I'm being stared at by a fat cat right now, actually.
[12:32] <infinity> I think he thinks it's breakfast time cause I'm awake. :/
[12:32] <lilstevie> lol
[12:33] <lilstevie> ffs why do people think it is a good idea to hardcode something like /MACHINE:X86 even though there is the same option elsewhere which is controlled by the target platform
[12:34] <infinity> This is why I love free software, at least.
[12:34] <infinity> Can you imagine the pain of the poor porters who had to sift through the Windows codebase after more than a decade of no one caring about it being portable?
[12:34] <lilstevie> haha
[12:34] <lilstevie> yeah
[12:35] <lilstevie> it is painful enough that some of this stuff depends on cpucontext
[12:35] <lilstevie> which doesn't quite line up
[12:35] <lilstevie> (direct register access)
[12:35] <infinity> Though, they could surprise me.  Maybe they maintained internal port builds all along to prevent just that sort of oops.
[12:35] <lilstevie> from what it sounds like it is a cleanroom port
[12:36] <infinity> Yeah.  Sounds more likely.
[12:36] <lilstevie> a lot of the outdated crap is gone
[12:36] <infinity> I somehow doubt the portability of NT4 survived 15 years.
[12:36] <lilstevie> or so I hear
[12:36] <teiler> infinity: it worked, thanks.
=== doko_ is now known as doko
[12:36] <lilstevie> there should be at least a little portability in the original code
[12:37] <infinity> Well, as much as any generic C and C++ is portable, obviously.
[12:37] <infinity> But I'm sure there are x86isms all over the effin' place too.
[12:37] <lilstevie> given that NT4 ran on mips and alpha
[12:37] <infinity> At least they don't have to care about endianisms this time around.
[12:38] <lilstevie> and there has been Itanium for a lot too
[12:38] <infinity> Yeah, MIPS, Alpha, and PPC.
[12:38] <infinity> I don't know that I ever actually saw an NT ia64 port in the wild.
[12:38] <infinity> Though I'm sure it must have existed.
[12:38] <infinity> All the ia64 kit I met ran HP/UX (or Debian).
[12:41] <lilstevie> hm
[12:42] <lilstevie> I am not sure, doesn't appear to be an IA64 version that I can find
[12:48] <teiler> inifinity: I made a dist-upgrade frrom 12.04 to 12.10, but it seems there is no omap4 linux packet any more?
[12:48] <infinity> teiler: linux-omap4
[12:48] <infinity> teiler: Definitely exists.
[12:49] <infinity> If you've done something strange to remove it, just "apt-get install linux-omap4"
[12:49] <infinity> Oh, unless you're running armel...
[12:49] <lilstevie> that would probably not go down well
[12:49] <lilstevie> :p
[12:49] <infinity> We didn't officially support armel for 12.04 for a reason. :P
[12:50] <infinity> And dropped the kernels from armel in 12.10.
[12:50] <infinity> (And dropped the userspace in 13.04)
[12:50] <infinity> So, in conclusion, use armhf. :P
[12:51] <infinity> And I should get some sleep.  It's 6am.
[12:51] <lilstevie> infinity: lol wow yeah get some sleep, 23:51 here
[12:51] <lilstevie> :p
[12:52] <teiler> infinity: 'No candidate version found for linux-omap4'
[12:52] <lilstevie> yeah probably cause of armel
[12:52] <infinity> teiler: Yeah, like I said...
[12:53] <infinity> teiler: If you installed precise/armel, you were installing a dead-end and unsupported platform.  We tried to make that clear.  Maybe not clear enough.
[12:53] <infinity> teiler: You want armhf.  It's the way and the light.
[12:54] <lilstevie> I wonder when canonical is going to say screw armv7 and move to armv8
[12:54] <lilstevie> :p
[12:55] <infinity> Well, we're doing aardvarch64 stuff pretty heavily right now.  But I doubt we'll drop armhf any time soon.
[12:55] <lilstevie> yeah
[12:55] <infinity> Plus, there may always be a neat use-case for armhf/arm64 multiarch for 32-bit goodness on your 64-bit kernel.
[12:55] <lilstevie> one big stopper on dropping armhf is no aarch64 stuff available :p
[12:56] <lilstevie> and I suppose aarch64 has the ability to multiarch a bit better
[12:56] <lilstevie> like x86/x86_64
[12:56] <teiler> infinity: so how do I switch? Can I dist-upgrade?
[12:56] <infinity> teiler: No.  You're pretty much stuck reinstalling.
[12:56] <lilstevie> teiler: the best way is to download a new image
[12:56] <lilstevie> dist-upgrade will leave you in a horridly broken state
[12:57] <infinity> teiler: Cross-grading arches is a stretch goal for multiarch, but it doesn't really work without a lot of manual fiddling right now.
[12:57] <infinity> And isn't worth the effort of trying.

[17:30] <Tassadar> hmm, nexus 7 has "serial debug shell" thing, where you can just "screen /dev/ttyACM0 115200" into the shell via usb
[17:30] <Tassadar> is that just kernel thing or must be something in userspace running?
[17:33] <kulve> Tassadar: you need to have login running in user space on correct port. It's ttyGS0 on nexus side
[17:56] <Tassadar> ah, that's what getty is for
[17:56] <Tassadar> now to figure out where should it be started in archlinux
[18:02] <itu>   hi
[18:03]  * itu would like to get some linux on his Jay-tech 9903H mini-netbook
[18:08] <Tassadar> ha, there it works now, thanks
[18:16] <Rjs> hmm, that reminds me: is there support in the ubuntu nexus7 kernel for the USB ethernet gadget device? on my openmoko gta02, I'm used to ssh'ing in via the USB connection (it's more versatile than just a serial port, for file transfers etc.), and I'd like to get the same on nexus7...
[18:17] <kulve> Rjs: at least it's possible to recompile kernel so that it's supported (usb0). I'm not sure if that's on by default with ubuntu's config
[18:17] <kulve> g_multi supports both the getty and the usb0 at the same time
[18:19] <Rjs> kulve: ok, g_multi sounds very good :) (just found drivers/usb/gadget/Kconfig in the kernel source) thanks! I'll try that when I compile my own kernel
[18:21] <Rjs> hmm, there's also USB_CDC_COMPOSITE which seems to have only serial + ethernet, while USB_G_MULTI also has mass storage (and is marked EXPERIMENTAL), maybe composite is better for me
[18:22] <kulve> if you run into compilation problems with fsl lock something functions related to those, just comment them out..
[18:23] <Rjs> ok, I'll keep that in mind (not trying it right now, maybe later today or tomorrow)
[18:29] <Rjs> it's not on in ubuntu's default kernel: only CONFIG_USB_SERIAL=y in /proc/config.gz, the other CONFIG_USB_G_* are unset (i.e., not even compiled as modules)
[18:42] <marvin24> how to solve "Cannot build any of the architectures requested: armel armhf" ?
[18:42]  * marvin24 hopes this is the right channel
[18:46] <jj234> is there any reason why my install of the omap4 preinstalled image wouldn't set $HOME for root?

[19:11] <stgraber> jon654: You've been told that already yesterday and things didn't change overnight, Ubuntu won't work on this tablet as it's an ARMv5 and we only support ARMv7
[19:12] <jon654> Not even an older version stgraber?
[19:14] <stgraber> the last time Ubuntu was fully built for ARMv5 armel, was around jaunty/karmic IIRC, neither of those are still around today
[19:14] <stgraber> and as other people told you, even if you get a userspace that works for your tablet, you'll still need to build a kernel for it yourself as that specific ARM platform has never been supported by Ubuntu or Linaro

[19:28] <Dj_Sammy> Someone there ?

[19:41] <Dj_Sammy> Can someone please reply?

[19:42] <Dj_Sammy> OKay... Im sorry for that :S
[19:42] <Tassadar> I like that bot Oo
[19:43] <komradefox> i used a usb keyboard on ubuntu on my nexus7, but when i reboot without the keyboard plugged in, i can't get a virtual one to sign in
[19:43] <Dj_Sammy> I want install Ubuntu on my Nexus7 16 G w/o Cellular. First: I must unlock the Kernel... But do i need an installed UBUNTU System on my PC? ?
[19:44] <Tassadar> komradefox: one of the icons in upper right corner should turn it on
[19:47] <komradefox> Tassadar: ah yes, thank you
[19:47] <komradefox> does the software update work on the n7?
[19:49] <komradefox> oh hmm i guess not, i get an error
[19:49] <komradefox> failed to fetch, sum mismatch,
[19:49] <Dj_Sammy> Tassadar?
[19:51] <Tassadar> You don't, but it is much easier
[19:52] <Tassadar> just download the live cd and boot from it, that should be enough (I am not "from ubuntu")
[19:52] <Dj_Sammy> ive got some old pc's, ill think that will work too
[19:56] <Tassadar> komradefox: it should
[19:56] <Tassadar> apt-get update && apt-get (dist-)upgrade works for me
[19:57] <komradefox> huh, i followed a guide to clear my apt. http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=11951697&postcount=2
[19:57] <komradefox> and that fixed it

[20:42] <simon> Anyone got this error with Lilstevie ubuntu (updated to 12.04, k2.6.36.4) when from a certain point after installing it.. It only reboots in readonly FS?
=== simon is now known as sim590
[20:44] <sim590> no matter if I run e2fsck.. it still does this
[20:48] <sim590> nvm.. It seems like fsck doesn't fix it really.. but e2fsck fixes it. For now it seems to work. You guys can light down Gondor's alarm firelights!
[20:49] <jj234> my u-boot command line contains "splash," is there any reason why I wouldn't still get a splash screen?
[20:49] <jj234> i have plymouth installed
[21:08] <sim590> well, it just randomly went back to read-only file system..
[21:10] <Tassadar> sim590: try to run dmesg, maybe there is more info in there
[21:12] <sim590> Yeah.. I've just done that and it says: [sda] Device not ready, [sda] Result: hostbyte=0x00 drivebyte=0x08,[sda] Sense key : 0x2 [current] ........... I/O error, dev sda, sector 6578354, lost page write due to I/O error on sda1
[21:13] <Tassadar> it's usb flash drive?
[21:13] <sim590> I'm using the SD card on the keyboard of the TF101
[21:13] <sim590> it's my rootfs
[21:13] <Tassadar> it is quiet possible that it the sdcard is corrupted
[21:13] <sim590> maybe I should use micro sd card
[21:13] <Tassadar> *quite
[21:14] <sim590> Or may be it sometimes has some bad contact with between the tablet and the keyboard
[21:14] <sim590> therefore, the journal is messed up
[21:14] <Tassadar> you could try to connect it to computer or something
[21:16] <sim590> I/O error wouldn't indicate that there's a connectivity problem?
[21:17] <Tassadar> well, it can as well might be that the sdcard is bad
[21:17] <Tassadar> I know that USB drives do that
[21:18] <sim590> my sd card is new
[21:18] <sim590> I've just bought it
[21:19] <Tassadar> then it is probably just bad contact, as you say
[21:19] <sim590> that's unfortunate.. I've bought that for nothing and costed 40$..
[21:20] <sim590> 32Go.. it's going to cost double the price for micro SD
[21:22] <Tassadar> I dunno how is sdcard connector mad in TF101, but can't you just, I don't know, put a piece of paper or something on top of the card so that the contact is correct?
[21:22] <Tassadar> *made
[21:23] <sim590> may be the problem is from the connection between the tablet adn the keyboard
[21:23] <sim590> you know where the table fixes itself. It's a little bit mobile there
[21:24] <sim590> it moves a little bit
[21:24] <sim590> may be the bad contact is there.
[21:25] <Tassadar> I'd really just try to stick that sd-card to computer and try if it is not bad
[21:25] <Tassadar> or try to use some other sdcard with the tablet
[21:26] <sim590> The sd card is ok. I use it with my pc and it always mounts
[21:27] <Tassadar> well, mount is one thing, have you tried to actually transfer some data to it?
[21:27] <sim590> the image i put on it took 2hours to dd
[21:27] <sim590> and everything was fine
[21:28] <sim590> it corrupts itself only when I put it in TF101
[21:33] <Tassadar> btw, how big was the image you dd-ed to it?
[21:34] <sim590> About 30Go
[21:35] <Tassadar> oh, okay, 2 hours seemed a little too much to me, but if the image is that big, then it's okay
[21:36] <Tassadar> well, I don't have anything else to tell, just try to make sure that the contacts are correct, but I guess you can figure that out)
[21:36] <sim590> I could resize it to less than this in order to take less time, but if I want to take advantage of the whole space on the partition, I have to resize it afterwards on the TF101
[21:36] <sim590> Thank you for your assistance, it's good to see we can get some echo
[21:38] <sim590> I just blow air in the slot. I hope it helps ^^
