[00:03] <neuro> i can't believe what was just said in this video
[00:03] <neuro> "for the first time, you'll have all the security of UNIX in your pocket"
[00:04] <neuro> oh, so iphone and android phones don't have the security of UNIX?
[00:04] <ali1234> and maemo
[00:04] <ali1234> and tizen
[00:04] <ali1234> and bada
[00:04] <neuro> totally
[00:04] <ali1234> and the razr OS
[00:05] <neuro> i think people forget that android = linux and ios = bsd
[00:05] <ali1234> also "ubuntu is the leading linux on ARM"
[00:06] <neuro> hee
[00:06] <ali1234> people wilfully deny that android = linux
[00:07] <ali1234> these people are just flat out wrong. there is no reasonable definition of linux which excludes android but includes everything else
[00:07] <neuro> ok, watching the 1 min video now
[00:07] <ali1234> not even incorrect but widely accepted ones
[00:07] <ali1234> such as "linux = X11"
[00:07] <ali1234> or "linux = gnu"
[00:08] <ali1234> see wayland and busybox for why

[09:16] <kvarley> hoover: You too :)
[09:16] <mungojerry> has anyone seen 13.01 touchy turtle in landscape mode? how does the launcher work?
[09:17] <mungojerry> stupid john lewis cancelled delivery of my large appliance because they had cancelled it without telling me grrr
[09:17] <mungojerry> mrs mungojerry wasted a whole day
[09:18] <JamesTait> Good morning all! :-D
[09:23] <dwatkins> ello folks
[09:23] <dwatkins> kvarley: in what way do you mean 'as a service'?
[09:24] <kvarley> dwatkins: Realised I can just run it on my Pi via screen and  that should work fine :) I just meant running it via screen basically so it would run even if I wasn't actively looking at it in terminal
[09:25] <dwatkins> kvarley: that's essentially what I do, but via a BSD box in another continent - I reattach to the screen session in which I run irssi and other things.
[09:27] <dwatkins> You can set screen up to run an app by default in a particular window, but the bare minimum you need to know is how to start, detach and reattach to screen, and how to navigate in irssi - if you're looking for fun ways to make screen look nicer see my latest blog entry: http://rowla.dyndns.org/blog
[09:27] <kvarley> Thanks dwatkins :)
[09:31] <Myrtti> tmux > screen
[09:31] <Myrtti> if for nothing else, then for better utf8 support
[09:33] <dwatkins> I should probably switch to tmux, perhaps I should write a conversion document with keystrokes and all.
[09:39] <dwatkins> I like that tmux uses a different control key by default, so as to avoid confusion when nesting one inside the other.
[09:40] <Myrtti> Ive just configured it to work the same as screen
[09:45] <mungojerry> wow john lewis are being jerks
[09:45] <dwatkins> I discovered loads of fun little features in Screen recently, like the coloured backtick outputs in the article I wrote about.

[10:00] <sprmtt> ok, so my question is this: there was talk of writing your apps for the phone in C, and using QML to modify the interface based on device type, but what of existing techs? Will people still be able to use quickly and PyGTK, etc?
[10:02] <KnightATwork> I was wondering if you could just install apps from the store straight on the phone.
[10:02] <sprmtt> I would assume so
[10:05] <bashrc> Has anyone tried the mobile development tools yet?
[10:06] <KnightATwork> sprmtt: it sounds pretty exciting. and it should work on the current Galaxy Nexus

[10:06] <KnightATwork> the Samsung one
[10:06] <sprmtt> I wanna know if it's going to work on my galaxy s3
[10:07] <sprmtt> considering that's *the* big phone at the moment, I'd have thought canonical would be trying for that
[10:07] <KnightATwork> sprmtt: the S3 is not so easy to root and rom as the nexus series
[10:08] <sprmtt> if this announcement was made a few months ago, it really would have swayed my smart phone choice :(

[10:57] <kvarley> Borrowing features for existing/past phone OS' is no bad thing, it'll mean people have some sort of grasp on how to use the devices.

[11:04] <marxjohnson> haha
[11:04] <marxjohnson> not to my knowledge
[11:04] <marxjohnson> cant get it to work?
[11:06] <popey> sometimes
[11:06] <popey> but most of my magnets don't trigger it
[11:07] <marxjohnson> weird, I had to try a couple but didnt have trouble finding one that did
[11:07] <dwatkins> I used to read slashdot, then I discovered reddit.
[11:07] <marxjohnson> popey: bring it along to the curry and I'll see if it works with mine
[11:07] <popey> marxjohnson: did you see brian post a link to one with integral magnet?
[11:07] <marxjohnson> yes
[11:08] <dwatkins> I have lots of hard disk magnets if anyone wants any.
[11:08] <marxjohnson> not much more expensive than the one i bought either
[11:08] <dwatkins> They're sitting on a book-end making a dangerzone for any floppy disk media on my desk.
[11:09] <popey> dont want one _that_ strong ☺
[11:09] <dwatkins> is this for a headphone organiser like a magneat or something, popey?
[11:09] <popey> smart cover for n7
[11:09] <dwatkins> ahh yes, I have one of those, nice leather one
[11:10] <marxjohnson> I made my own, but popey's having problems
[11:10] <Myrtti> poetic sent us ones with too strong magnets
[11:10] <dwatkins> hmmm, I can't actually find any magnets, perhaps mine just uses the proximity sensor

[11:14] <marxjohnson> Does anyone remember seeing a discussion online, maybe a week or so ago, where someone asked why Ubuntu for phones won't just be compatible with Android apps, and someone (possibly sabdfl) responded explaining why?
[11:16] <xnox> "With all-native core apps and no Java overhead" http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone
[11:16] <popey> i can tell you why
[11:16] <popey> no platform every succeeded by emulating another platform
[11:16] <popey> you can't succeed when someone else owns the platform you're building on
[11:16] <marxjohnson> I remember why, I just want to find where it was said so I can reference it in a blog post :)
[11:17] <marxjohnson> unless I just remember you telling me that when we were doing the last show
[11:17] <directhex> popey, not actually true.
[11:17] <popey> examples?
[11:18] <directhex> kindle fire, which isn't android as far as "can download apps from android app store" goes
[11:18] <popey> that _is_ android though
[11:18] <popey> it's not Amazon OS with android emulation on top
[11:18] <marxjohnson> This is what I was thinking about http://news.slashdot.org/story/12/12/09/1828238/mark-shuttleworth-answers-your-questions
[11:18] <directhex> that's a pretty academic difference
[11:19] <directhex> mobile devices will run an android kernel, even when they're not android
[11:19] <dwatkins> You can fairly easily set a Kindle Fire to allow other apps to install.
[11:19] <directhex> since silicon vendors only bother with android drivers nowadays
[11:19] <popey> that doesnt mean you have to run android apps
[11:20] <popey> see jolla
[11:20] <popey> they (may be?) optionally allowing that
[11:20] <popey> but it's not a feature you have to bake in as a byproduct of using an android kernel and drivers
[11:20] <popey> it's a value proposition they've chosen to add
[11:21] <directhex> arguing about OSes is ignoring that we are in an era of ecosystems, of course
[11:21] <popey> indeed
[11:21] <popey> and that's a hurdle
[11:21] <popey> but yay webapps ;)

[11:49] <ali1234> there is no such thing as android emulation
[11:50] <ali1234> the bigger problem is android apps aren't just like "draw some stuff on the screen and bsd sockets and stdio"
[11:50] <ali1234> if they were it would be trivial to handle them
[11:51] <popey> how does RIM doe it on the playbook with QNX?
[11:51] <ali1234> they licensed that compat layer
[11:52] <popey> oh yes, that 3rd party thing
[11:52] <ali1234> probably the same one done by jolla
[11:52] <ali1234> it's really good i heard
[11:52] <popey> jolla is libhybris
[11:52] <ali1234> admittedly i heard from one of the developers of it
[11:52] <popey> well, bits of it
[11:52] <AlanBell> probably asking a silly question, but I thought android apps were written in java and running on the dalvik JVM
[11:52] <ali1234> that's hardware stuff
[11:53] <popey> yeah, sorry
[11:53] <AlanBell> so why don't they run on openJDK?
[11:54] <ali1234> because... because... what i said ^
[11:54] <ali1234> android API has nothing at all to do with java
[11:55] <AlanBell> ok, so it provides hardware interfaces and classes for the java apps to use?
[11:56] <ali1234> no
[11:56] <ali1234> nothing can really even touch the hardware
[11:56] <ali1234> it's so completely abstracted
[11:58] <ali1234> http://openmobileww.com/products.php <- this thing

[12:00] <sprmtt> \o/
[12:00] <sprmtt> that's a lot of porn you're saving
[12:00] <Azelphur> indeed
[12:02] <einonm> ali1234: The statement that the android api has nothing to do with java is incorrect. It's a Java language API.
[12:03] <ali1234> yes, i meant it has nothing to do with the java standard libraries
[12:05] <directhex> Azelphur, american?
[12:05] <directhex> Azelphur, aren't they all made in thailand?
[12:05] <Azelphur> directhex: nabbed them in the newegg sales, $99 a pop
[12:05] <Azelphur> on black friday
[12:06] <Azelphur> so, I mean purchased in USA, rather than manufactured in USA :)
[12:06] <Azelphur> ali1234: what was that rfid site again? I need to buy things :p
[12:06] <einonm> the davlik JVM does implement several of the simpler standard java libraries, java.io for example - athough it's not any particular defined java profile

[12:24] <Azelphur> no, but I bought tags from rapidnfc, I can print the qr code to size and just put the nfc tag on it

[13:04] <kvarley> Does starting screen over SSH work if I end the SSH session or will it take the screen session with it?
[13:05] <dwatkins> kvarley: you can indeed start screen having logged in via ssh; if you detach from it, the screen session keeps running (ctrl+A,d to detach)
[13:05] <brobostigon> you detach the screen session and it will stay running, untill you re-attach it.

[13:19] <ali1234> ok, it's not that funny at all
[13:29] <dwatkins> what did he expect to use to scan it? ;)
[13:34] <ali1234> i don't know
[13:34] <ali1234> i don't think he had any idea what it was at all tbh
[13:35] <dwatkins> fair enough, I guess they're not that popular
[13:35] <dwatkins> it's so much hassle to use a QR code, you might as well just type in the URL half the time
[13:38] <ali1234> or just phoogrph the URL and google goggles will process that too
[13:43] <ddfgt> hi
[13:44] <ddfgt> someone can help me with sed?
[13:44] <brobostigon> can the rpi, safely be left turned on and plugged in all the time? it is model"B"-rev2.
[13:44] <sprmtt> ddfgt: what kind of help do you need?
[13:45] <dwatkins> brobostigon: it doesn't get very hot, so I'd say the danger of fire is minimal; it uses about 3 Watts (according to my mains tester) and the current releases seem to be fairly stable, so I'd say 'yes'
[13:46] <mungojerry> QR codes have a use, but they are over-used by marketing bods
[13:46] <ddfgt> sprmtt, if the text is: aa bb cc dd ee ff gg
[13:46] <brobostigon> dwatkins: thank you, i wasnt sure, over long periods of time, :)
[13:46] <ddfgt> i want to change everything between bb to ee
[13:46] <ddfgt> so i will get aa my-text ff gg
[13:46] <dwatkins> brobostigon: mine did tend to hang after a few days, but I had it replaced due to the resistors being wrong on the USB ports, not tried the new one for as long yet
[13:47] <dwatkins> I'll have to to what kvarley is doing, and setup a screen session with irssi so I can see if it's up
[13:47] <sprmtt> ddfgt: you might be better with awk
[13:47] <brobostigon> dwatkins: ah, ok, i will keep an eye on that, i plan to turn it into a tv connected internet type thing, with a wireless keyboard/mouse/remote.
[13:47] <sprmtt> awk '{print $1, yourtext, $6, $7}';
[13:48] <sprmtt> oh wait, you have to specify the input, of course :P
[13:48] <brobostigon> dwatkins: i am doing an test, and am running byobu and top.
[13:48] <dwatkins> this works, but I don't know what pitfalls there might be, ddfgt - echo "aa bb cc dd ee ff gg" | sed 's/bb.*ee/my-text/'
[13:49] <dwatkins> e.g. sed can end up replacing far more than you would expect
[13:56] <ali1234> heh, you can't really do this with regular expressions
[13:56] <ali1234> you can with extended regexp, but that doesn't work everywhere
[13:56] <dwatkins> oh, I didn't realise I was using extended regexp
[13:57] <ali1234> well, either you are using extended regexp, or your regexp will have unintended consequences :)
[13:57] <ali1234> i can't remember the specifics
[13:57] <dwatkins> yeah, it might grab the entire line if there's a 'bb' or an 'ee' beyond the bit that ddfgt wants to change
[13:58] <ali1234> yeah regexp is greedy, and the extensions allow you to turn that off
[13:58] <ali1234> that's all i remember
[14:01] <dwatkins> thanks 'greedy' was the operative word I'd forgotten
[14:01] <cocoa117> what kind local search tool is currently widely used on Ubuntu 12.04? The dash seems don't support deep searching or content searching for my openoffice files
[14:02] <ali1234> find
[14:02] <ali1234> and grep
[14:02] <cocoa117> ali1234, GUI would be good here, :)
[14:02] <ali1234> gnome-terminal
[14:03] <mungojerry> anyone claimed child benefit lately - is it done after the birth of the child? (seems so)
[14:03] <ali1234> there's a search tool in nautilus
[14:03] <cocoa117> by the way, can find search inside the contents of a file?
[14:03] <ali1234> no but grep can
[14:03] <cocoa117> but grep can only search for txt file, right? can it deal with openoffice file?
[14:04] <ali1234> it will look for strings inside binary files, yes
[14:04] <ali1234> usually text of your document is in there in plain text
[14:04] <ormiret> aren't openoffice files compressed xml though?
[14:04] <ali1234> maybe
[14:05] <ali1234> even compressed files will still have most of the text inside them as plain text
[14:07] <cocoa117> ali1234, it didn't work, i just test it
[14:08] <cocoa117> it tell me its a binary file
[14:11] <diplo> Loook.py
[14:11] <diplo> http://www.danielnaber.de/loook/ supposedly works ?
[14:16] <popey> ali1234: http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/3/3830394/leap-motion-asus-pc-deal
[14:21] <ali1234> so has anyone received developer units yet>
[14:25] <Azelphur> anyone got a VOIP account and mind calling 1415982@sipgate.co.uk to see if it goes through for me? :)
[14:25] <Azelphur> battling with connection issues :p
[14:25] <dwatkins> sure, Azelphur
[14:27] <dwatkins> I have a 6-digit sipgate number, are you certain that's the right one? I get 'number unreachable'
[14:27] <Azelphur> pretty sure, it's the username right?
[14:28] <dwatkins> there's a separate SIP username/passwd, if you login to http://sipgate.co.uk/ and click 'settings' at the top right, it'll show you them
[14:28] <Azelphur> yea, that's the page I'm looking at
[14:28] <Azelphur> it says my SIP-ID is 1419582
[14:28] <dwatkins> You probably want to provide 'SIP-ID' and 'SIP password' to your client application.
[14:28] <popey> it failed for me too
[14:28] <dwatkins> ah yes, sorry - mine is in fact 7 digits, my bad
[14:29] <Azelphur> guess the sipgate android app doesn't work either ;)
[14:29] <dwatkins> if I type my own 7-digit SIP number, I get 'line busy', suggesting I'm dialling correctly.
[14:29] <dwatkins> I just use the built-in SIP stuff, Azelphur
[14:29] <Azelphur> yea, I'm behind a freebie sky router and my brother has all the relevant ports forwarded to him
[14:29] <Azelphur> so it's a connectivity nightmare :p
[14:29] <dwatkins> I get asked every time I place a call if I want to use the mobile network or the internet, but it's fairly seamless
[14:29] <dwatkins> oh my, yeah
[14:30] <dwatkins> should be possible to use a STUN server to login etc.
[14:30]  * dwatkins tries to find the settings on CM7
[14:30] <Azelphur> yea, that's what I was thinking, but I'd assume the proper android app is set up with STUN
[14:31] <popey> your brother uses SIP too?
[14:31] <Azelphur> popey: yep
[14:31] <Azelphur> we both use sipgate for incoming calls (no mobile signal indoors)
[14:31] <dwatkins> aha, it's under call settings -> accounts on my Android phone
[14:32] <popey> you could run asterisk on a server somewhere and use a different port between your client and that server
[14:32] <dwatkins> username is my 7-digit SIP-ID, server is sipgate.co.uk, that's all that seems necessary to set
[14:32] <Azelphur> dwatkins: yea, it's definitely a NAT issue for me as it works if I connect to 3g or other wifi
[14:33] <dwatkins> transport type UDP, port is the standard, 5060 - I'm using the 3G network for this, so perhaps it's different if you're behind a NAT'ed firewall
[14:33] <dwatkins> ah ok, yeah
[14:33] <Azelphur> popey: I considered that, asterisk seems a bit of a beast to set up though :(
[14:33] <dwatkins> I did get it to work from inside my flat with wifi, but perhaps my router is allowing my phone to do pnp-type dynamic port forwarding
[14:34] <dwatkins> http://code.google.com/p/sipdroid/wiki/NewStandbyTechnique might explain, not sure though
[14:35] <Azelphur> yea, it worked fine on my wifi before I moved too, just my brother has a horrible network :p
[14:35] <dwatkins> simple solution, then ;)
[14:35] <Azelphur> and yea, I just tried csipsimple with stun enabled and still don't get through
[14:35] <Azelphur> :<
[14:36] <dwatkins> I rtied setting up ssh port forwarding on my android phone, but it didn't work too well, sadly
[14:36] <dwatkins> *tried
[15:02] <bigcalm> I really should pay attention to updates applied to my workstation. Just rebooted and now my 2nd gfx card isn't being used. Down to 2 screens now :(
[15:03] <directhex> shameful/.
[15:03] <bigcalm> Somebody want to take a look at my xorg log and tell me what's not working now? :)
[15:05] <bigcalm> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1492222/
[15:05] <popey> [     6.114] (EE) NVIDIA(2): Failed to assign any connected display devices to X screen 2
[15:05] <popey> [     6.116] (EE) NVIDIA(2): Failing initialization of X screen 2
[15:06] <bigcalm> Indeed, but does it hint to why?
[15:06] <bigcalm> I did note that compiz was updated today
[15:07] <bigcalm> I don't know if it's related, but recently that screen has been showing its "no signal" message rather than going blank like the other 2
[15:27] <directhex> http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/3/3831012/the-ubuntu-phone-has-a-speed-problem-and-im-not-talking-about-lag
[15:35] <ali1234> i have to agree with that
[15:38] <ali1234> though ultimately it doesn't matter
[15:39] <ali1234> i mean you can barely even buy a PC with Ubuntu on it
[15:43] <solarcloud_3scrn> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL_ntkb2-HE
[15:44] <solarcloud_3scrn> @ 1 min in the vidz.
[15:48] <AlanBell> I hardly think that 2014 is the end of the phone market
[16:04] <dwatkins> I wonder if the Ubuntu phone will run flash... ;)
[16:05] <popey> pfft, who wants _that_
[16:05] <dwatkins> hehe
[16:05] <ali1234> oh, maybe i imagined it then
[16:05] <brobostigon> dwatkins: well there isnt a linux arm port, so question already answered.
[16:05] <popey> dunno, i have seen a lot of people mention "2 weeks"
[16:05] <popey> maybe it's been mentioned elsewhere
[16:05] <popey> brobostigon: sure there is
[16:05] <dwatkins> ah yes brobostigon
[16:05] <brobostigon> popey: for android there is.
[16:05] <popey> android is arm
[16:05] <popey> mostly
[16:06] <ali1234> maybe i started the two weeks thing lol
[16:06] <brobostigon> popey: but i coul;dnt run that, on debian on arm, for example.
[16:07] <einonm1> I'm assuming that the phone release will be something like the ubuntu N7 userspace running on a recent kernel..or is it a totally different development branch?
[16:07] <popey> its using the AOSP kernel
[16:07] <popey> ubuntu userland
[16:07] <ali1234> doesn't the current N7 image do that though?
[16:07] <brobostigon> ah.
[16:07] <ali1234> and, does it run X11?
[16:08] <brobostigon> popey: so i could load the adboce flash apk into it?
[16:08] <popey> brobostigon: dunno
[16:08] <brobostigon> adobe*
[16:08] <einonm1> popey: thanks. Should run on my N1 then, with tweaks
[16:08] <popey> i was just pointing out that flash has been ported to arm
[16:08] <ali1234> brobostigon: NO
[16:09] <brobostigon> popey: yes, i knew that, and only for android, not a normal linux distro, running on arm.
[16:09] <ali1234> brobostigon: wrong
[16:09] <ali1234> again :)
[16:09] <ali1234> firstly, android *is* a normal android distribution
[16:10] <Dave2> That's a very abnormal normal
[16:10] <brobostigon> ali1234: ok, can i use the android apk of adobe flash, on debian on arm?
[16:10] <ali1234> secondly, flash was on the N900
[16:11] <ali1234> thirdly, no, running an android kernel doesn't allow you to use apks
[16:11] <ali1234> not any more than running a fedora kernel would allow ubuntu to magically use RPMs
[16:12] <brobostigon> exactly, so the answer to my question is no. but i knew that already.
[16:13] <ali1234> i don't see your point
[16:13] <brobostigon> i think my question was lost along time ago. but i knew what i was asking.
[16:19] <ali1234> has anyone asked rafe if he's gonna set up allaboutubuntuphone.com?
[16:21] <popey> who?
[16:21] <ali1234> the guy in ur video...
[16:21] <popey> dunno which video you're on about ☺
[16:21] <ali1234> who runs allaboutsymbian.com and now allaboutwindowsphone.com
[16:21] <popey> oh
[16:22] <popey> never heard of either site
[16:22] <ali1234> *facepalm*
[16:22] <ali1234> http://vimeo.com/20373013 <- this guy
[16:25] <DJones> Another viewpoint on the the Ubuntu phone http://slashdot.org/topic/bi/who-would-actually-build-an-ubuntu-smartphone/
[16:26] <ali1234> well i'm guessing that even if nobody does, it will work on every nexus newer than gnex without much difficulty at all
[16:27] <ali1234> at the very least, it could be as popular as cyanogenmod, which is quite popular considering it's an after market hack
[16:37] <DJones> I'd agree with that, I can see quite a few Ubuntu users trying it out, I'm tempted to try it on my S3 once I see how it comes out
[16:44] <ali1234> i will definitely install it on something
[16:44] <einonm1> dammit, I don't think the UPhone (Cann we call it that?) will run on an N1 - min core is an Arm A9, N1 has A8 I think
[16:55] <diplo> I've got a project I'd like to try and i know a few of you tinker
[16:56] <diplo> Have a very old radio 20+ years old
[16:56] <diplo> Want to remove the guts and turn it into a dab style radio
[16:56] <diplo> Using current dials etc
[16:56] <diplo> Anyone ever tried or know anywhere to find info about this ?
[16:57] <MartijnVdS> diplo: if you can find a small DAB radio that has the kinds of dials you want it to have, it should be easy
[16:57] <diplo> Iw as thinking more of a board and I wire the current dials into it
[16:57] <MartijnVdS> DAB boards I haven'
[16:57] <MartijnVdS> t found yet
[16:58] <MartijnVdS> except very expensive
[16:58] <diplo> yeah, seems that way
[16:58] <einonm1> you'd be stuck trying to convert the analogue tuner dial into a digital one. That doesn't sound simple
[16:58] <MartijnVdS> einonm1: if you replace all the guts it's easy :)
[16:59] <MartijnVdS> well the display might be a challenge
[16:59] <diplo> yeah, just want to use the dial to tune and turn up, no more functionality than that
[16:59] <diplo> yeah that's the only issue i think
[16:59] <MartijnVdS> diplo: http://www.monkeyboard.org/products/85-developmentboard/80-dab-fm-digital-radio-development-board
[16:59] <MartijnVdS> boom :)
[17:00] <diplo> Basically my gf loves this old radio, but turn it on and it progressively gets louder and doesn't get very good signal. She likes the outside not the guts
[17:00] <MartijnVdS> that + arduino for the controls = custom DAB radio
[17:00] <einonm1> MartijnVdS: I was considering having to convert the dial position to a real number - with a display, you wouldn't need that
[17:01] <MartijnVdS> einonm1: you could make the dial "pulse" on rotation.. then each pulse is one channel up/down
[17:01] <MartijnVdS> einonm1: or every X pulses = 1 channel
[17:02] <diplo> I was thinking along those lines, although never done anything like this
[17:02] <diplo> So it was all just in my head
[17:02] <diplo> :)
[17:02] <MartijnVdS> diplo: http://www.coolcomponents.co.uk/catalog/digital-radio-development-board-with-slideshow-p-1078.html -> UK reseller
[17:02] <MartijnVdS> diplo: the Arduino community is really helpful with things like this, names of companies with useful stuff: sparkfun, adafruit ;)
[17:03] <ali1234> you can already get dab radios that do thaaaaaaat
[17:03] <MartijnVdS> ali1234: DAB radios that replace old radio guts?
[17:03] <MartijnVdS> ali1234: because that seems very specific..
[17:04] <ali1234> no dab radios that have an old fashioned style tuning dial
[17:04] <diplo> Oooh not to pricey, I'm defo interested. better skills than me MartijnVdS thank you
[17:04] <ali1234> also
[17:04] <diplo> ali1234: It's a specific radio my GF already owns, she loves the look of it
[17:04] <ali1234> you can get a dab usb tuner
[17:04] <MartijnVdS> ali1234: but no drivers for anything
[17:04] <ali1234> no drivers?
[17:05] <einonm1> extra points if you use a steampunk style ticker tape for the display output. That's proper retro.
[17:06] <ali1234> anyway, those dab tuners are actually software radios
[17:08] <diplo> heh, http://www.antiqueradio.com/images/Feb01-Arnold-Firestone.jpg
[17:08] <diplo> Bit like that
[17:09] <diplo> Thanks for those anyhoo, will take a look into it thank you.
[17:09] <diplo> Better go and pick my sisters dog up

[18:09] <Laney> Where can I get a non-crap suit for not much money?
[18:10] <MartijnVdS> Laney: Thailand
[18:10] <Laney> before Tuesday
[18:11] <einonm1> Slaters are pretty good. Can't beat charity shops for cheapness tho - if you don't mind wearing a dead man's suit.
[18:12] <directhex> how much do you consider "not much"?
[18:12] <MartijnVdS> Laney: one-day return ticket to Bangkok should be doable ;)
[18:12] <directhex> i got married in a hundred quid m&s suit
[18:12] <MartijnVdS> Laney: or just give them your measurements and have it shipped overnight
[18:12] <boot_> Hello I want make a usbstick bootable.It doesn't work. i need a administrative terminal to start this programm ./bootinst.sh. error: Nor rights
[18:13] <brobostigon> sudo/gksudo

[18:20] <Laney> cheers
[18:20] <Laney> I'd assumed George would be crap quality
[18:20] <davmor2> Laney: Not at all, Okay Quality, Great Lastibility, reasonable price
[19:31] <ali1234> you know what i really hate
[19:32] <ali1234> when people ask you to do something so you do it, but then instead of just checking themselves which they easily could do they pester you with emails and SMS messages asking if you have done it
[19:42] <Azelphur> I stumbled upon this...I wonder if I could use it to NFC Phone enable my credit card http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2012/07/27/hacker-demos-android-app-that-can-read-and-use-a-credit-card-thats-still-in-your-wallet/ :p
[19:44] <ali1234> no
[19:44] <ali1234> you would have to scan your card every time
[19:44] <Azelphur> why not? :<
[19:44] <Azelphur> true
[19:44] <ali1234> and then scan the payment thing with your phone
[19:44] <ali1234> you might as well just use the card
[19:45] <Azelphur> I could do it purely for the gimick, haha
[19:45] <ali1234> you could do but nobody would care
[19:45] <Azelphur> indeed
[19:52] <ali1234> i don't understand why you even want to do NFC payments
[19:53] <Azelphur> I think it's cool technology
[19:53] <Azelphur> and I bet cool things could be done like fully automated accounting
[19:54] <ali1234> "cool" "accounting"
[19:54] <ali1234> what's wrong with you?
[19:54] <Azelphur> lol
[19:56] <ali1234> has anyone ever heard of ipad "restore loop"
[20:05] <MartijnVdS> I wouldn't be surprised
[20:05] <MartijnVdS> they can't do dates right.. backups are harder
[20:31] <popey> ali1234: the thing where it always wants to be attached to itunes?
[20:31] <popey> like its been factory reset?
[20:31] <ali1234> go on...
[20:32] <popey> my mother in law had occasion recently where her ipad 2 locked up
[20:32] <ali1234> someone asked me about their ipad they literally said "it's in a restore loop. how do i fixed it?"
[20:32] <popey> we did a hard reset, power down with lots of buttons held down or something
[20:32] <ali1234> yeah, it's an ipad2
[20:32] <popey> it came back up with an itunes cable thing on the screen
[20:32] <ali1234> yeah, he wants to get some files of it before doing that
[20:32] <popey> meaning "lets start again"
[20:32] <popey> however it was mistaken
[20:32] <popey> the stuff was all still there
[20:33] <popey> just needed another clean reboot holding down power for like 20 seconds
[20:33] <popey> there's a page on apple support about it
[20:33] <popey> it came back just fine
[20:33] <popey> but only after that veeeeery long press reboot
[20:33] <ali1234> odd.
[20:34] <ali1234> so there's no way to get files out of it, other than doing something that could potentially hard reset it?
[20:34] <ali1234> hard reset means "erase all user files" to me
[20:35] <popey> lemme find the article
[20:35] <popey> it did sound scary
[20:35] <popey> but its not
[20:35] <popey> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKHgtdmp3h4
[20:35] <popey> maybe?
[20:36] <popey> not watched all yet, but description looks right
[20:36] <popey> oh no, he wants to download sommat, ignore that
[20:37] <popey> http://ipod.about.com/od/iphonetroubleshooting/f/Iphone-Stuck-At-Apple-Logo.htm
[20:37] <popey> that looks familiar, i think that's what I talked mother in law through
[20:37] <ali1234> so "restore" won't erase user files?
[20:40] <ali1234> is the U1 for iPad with photosync? if so i'll recommend that (or dropbox/g+)
[20:41] <ali1234> it's mainly about not losing photos on the device
[20:41] <popey> U1 Files does upload photos to U1
[20:41] <ali1234> for that matter i would have expected apple to have something like that anyway
[20:41] <popey> restore from backup will replace stuff
[20:41] <popey> it does
[20:41] <popey> icloud
[20:44] <ali1234> hmm i don't think he has a backup
[20:44] <popey> never setup icloud backup?
[20:45] <popey> or synced to itunes?
[20:45] <ali1234> dunno. he probably wouldn't be asking me if he did
[20:46] <popey> well with M-i-L we didnt do any restore
[20:47] <ali1234> hmm
[20:55] <ali1234> well, replied. thanks for the help
[21:07] <popey> np
[21:22] <Azelphur> Is there anything out there like a multiplayer web browser, so two people see exactly the same content?
[21:23] <ormiret> Azelphur: one browser plus VNC for the second player?
[21:24] <Azelphur> could do, kinda slow but yea
[21:24] <Azelphur> was hoping there was some web app that did it, so you could both just open the same webpage without any installing of things
[21:24] <ormiret> There are screensharing webapps
[21:25] <Azelphur> ah yea, could do that I suppose
[21:25] <ali1234> kazam has really gone downhill since they decided to turn it into a do everything machine
[21:26] <ali1234> it no longer reliably records video, which is the only thing i want it to do
[21:26] <popey> how so?
[21:26] <ali1234> 50% of the time it will just freeze when i stop recording
[21:26] <popey> poke them in #kazam or file a bug
[21:26] <popey> they're active
[21:26] <popey> h264 or vp8?
[21:26] <ali1234> and 50% of the time when that doesn't happen the resulting file just freezes at exactly 1:30
[21:26] <ali1234> "gstreamer"
[21:27] <ali1234> er, vp8
[21:27] <popey> I'd use h264
[21:27] <popey> faster, more reliable
[21:27] <ali1234> ok
[21:27] <ali1234> vp8 is the default tho
[21:27] <popey> yeah
[21:27] <ali1234> \o/ defaults that actually work
[21:27] <popey> free software loonies ;)
[21:28] <ali1234> it's annoying when you;re trying to do a screencast without fluffing the lines and when you mess up it always works
[21:28] <ali1234> but when you get it right "oops i decided not to record anything that time"
[21:28] <popey> heh
[21:28] <popey> yeah
[21:29] <ali1234> i need to get one of those hdmi capture thingies
[21:29] <ali1234> though the other day someone was telling me they are not very good
[21:29] <popey> i have one
[21:29] <ali1234> but then it was a gnome developer so what does he know :)
[21:29] <popey> i have two in fact
[21:29] <ali1234> yeah you said :)
[21:37] <ali1234> nope, h264 does exactly the same thing
[21:38] <ali1234> click "finish recording" and it doesn't show the next dialog where you save the video
[21:46] <popey> can you run kazam --debug and see what you get ?
[21:49] <ali1234> https://bugs.launchpad.net/kazam/+bug/1080226
[21:49] <lubotu3> Ubuntu bug 1080226 in Kazam Screencaster "Doesnt show save video after screen record xubuntu 12.10" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[21:49] <ali1234> been there, done that
[21:49] <ali1234> actually someone did it before me
[21:57] <ali1234> the most tedious thing about doing screencasts over and over is resetting everything that you need to do
[22:04] <ali1234> i get the feeling that gstreamer is totally to blame for this
[22:04] <ali1234> attached debug log anyway
[23:01] <bigcalm> Ahoy
