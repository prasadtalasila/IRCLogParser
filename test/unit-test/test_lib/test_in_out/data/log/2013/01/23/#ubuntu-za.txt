[06:31] <Kilos> seems to be good
[06:32] <Kilos> and my maverick seems to have got corrupted somehow
[06:32] <Kilos> can only boot to it if its second drive and i did update-grub
[06:32] <Kilos> the boot repair corrupts everything on my maverick
[06:34] <Kilos> hi magespawn 
[06:34] <Kilos> hiya maiatoday 
[06:34] <maiatoday> hi Kilos
[06:53] <superfly> hi maiatoday
[06:54] <maiatoday> hi superfly
[07:05] <nlsthzn> Kilos: better thanks... had a good nights rest which is always good too
[07:05] <nlsthzn> hi all

[07:13] <Vince-0> hiho

[07:13] <Kilos> hi hmmmmmer
[07:13] <Vince-0> off to work we go
[07:19] <zeref> hi Kilos 
[07:26] <Kilos> hi Symmetria whats news with a host for us?
[07:26] <Kilos> you forgot
[07:27] <nlsthzn> So not much discussion about the loco gaming took place in the meeting I saw :p
[07:28] <Kilos> nope nlsthzn methinks the time diffs is too great
[07:28] <Kilos> but there was talk of doing it locally i think
[07:29] <Kilos> interesting concept if you stay in your timezone hey?
[07:29] <nlsthzn> if 5 pm on a Saturday was a problem for people to game I would have agreed....
[07:29] <nlsthzn> But to me it sounds like a good time
[07:29] <nlsthzn> then again anytime sounds good to me
[07:29] <Kilos> thats -8 to mexico
[07:29] <Kilos> they still sleeping
[07:31] <nlsthzn> that is 9 am and that is the time they chose
[07:32] <Kilos> oh they wanna play in their mornings
[07:32] <Kilos> hi henkj 
[07:32] <henkj> hi Kilos 
[07:33] <nlsthzn> it is always morning or evening someplace
[07:34] <Kilos> lol
[07:36] <hubx> hi
[07:36] <Kilos> hi hubx 
[07:50] <Vince-0> I reckon we should test those games and latency before anything
[07:50] <Kilos> you volunteering Vince-0 ?
[07:51] <Kilos> Maaz, spell volunteer
[07:51] <Maaz> Kilos: Yup, that's a word all right
[07:51] <Vince-0> can do, 
[07:51] <Kilos> ty Vince-0 let us know what you find
[07:51] <Vince-0> need to know what games and what servers
[07:51] <Kilos> nlsthzn, you got the info?
[07:52] <Kilos> i gotta scroll back faaaaar to find the links
[07:52] <inetpro> goeie dag Kilos
[07:53] <Vince-0> I saw some games mentioned but the actual link to the list didn't work - also no mention of servers
[07:53] <Kilos> hehe groetnes boetman
[07:53] <Vince-0> I guess a trace route / ping test to their IPs is a good indication
[07:54] <Vince-0> but in my experience anything over 100ms in a FPS game is unplayable - and EU is at least 220ms never mind South America
[07:54] <Kilos> Vince-0, you can get them on #ubuntu-mx
[07:54] <Kilos> ai
[07:54] <Vince-0> so no FPS'es 
[07:55] <Kilos> where is nlsthzn now?
[07:55] <inetpro> so on the glug mailing list Rudi is talking about " D6 Communicator works on Adobe Air", has anybody got this working on *ubuntu?
[07:55] <Kilos> he knows about such stuff. im a greeter bot
[07:55]  * inetpro wonders
[07:56] <Kilos> inetpro, thats not on our list
[07:56] <Vince-0> okok
[07:56] <inetpro> Kilos: I know
[07:56] <Kilos> clever boy
[07:56] <inetpro> Kilos: but I'm asking here
[07:57] <Kilos> ok be patient. maybe someone will see your question
[07:57] <Kilos> hehe
[07:57] <inetpro> I know about several schools using D6 Communicator
[08:19]  * nlsthzn is at work wouldn't you know uncle Kilos 
[08:19] <Kilos> lemme try find them nlsthzn sorry

[08:28] <magespawn> Morning again
[08:28] <magespawn> I don't think they have published the server address yet
[08:32] <magespawn> Kilos do you still have those file copy cammands?
[08:33] <Kilos> hehe which ones mage
[08:33] <Kilos> oh 
[08:33] <Kilos> ssh ones
[08:35] <magespawn> those be the ones
[08:36] <Kilos> rsync -av /var/cache/apt/archives/ ANN:/tmp/myarchives/
[08:37] <Kilos> sudo cp -r /tmp/myarchives/* /var/cache/apt/archives/
[08:38] <magespawn> do the directories have to be crerated first, or do the commands do it for you?
[08:39] <Kilos> i was copying archives as you can see so need tmp
[08:39] <Kilos> did it on its own
[08:39] <Kilos> ANN is the server
[08:42] <Kilos> dunno where pro sucked that name from but anyway
[08:43] <Kilos> such a cheek calling my pcs BOB and ANN
[08:44] <magespawn> careful, you'll have him 'ai'ing all over the place
[08:46] <Kilos> rofl

[10:25] <not_found> I can't remember which side I chose when I was checking it out however "
[10:30] <superfly> not_found: I chose Resistance
[10:33] <not_found> I can't remember, I think I chose resistance and then exited the app... perhaps I can re-role (I hope :p)

[18:49] <superfly> Kilos: so quiet I wasn't even here
[18:50] <Kilos> see the prob is completely gone
[18:50]  * superfly has submitted 3 portals, and knows of 1 unclaimed portal in the far south
[18:55] <superfly> got 3 other places here in Muizenberg to submit, just need to go take photos 
[18:56] <Kilos> what are you doing superfly ?
[18:56] <Kilos> explain in mechanics language
[18:57] <superfly> Kilos: I'm playing a game called Ingress, where people from all around the world take part, and try to gain control of special virtual portals
[18:58] <Kilos> what is a virtual portal?
[18:58] <Kilos> and how they try to gain control of them
[18:59] <nlsthzn> carefully
[18:59]  * nlsthzn goes to bed...
[18:59] <Kilos> lol
[18:59] <nlsthzn> g night all
[18:59] <Kilos> night nlsthzn sleep tight
[18:59] <superfly> these portals are in real life locations, so you have to physically go to these locations in order to take control of these portals
[19:00] <Kilos> whew
[19:00] <magespawn> hey
[19:00] <Kilos> is there a right up about this game somewhere
[19:00] <Kilos> wb magespawn 
[19:00] <Kilos> what happened
[19:01] <magespawn> Up at the hluhluwe hotel trying to fing the fault on their network
[19:01] <superfly> there's a game for these fancy phones which identifies these portals and you use it to "hack" the portals
[19:02] <superfly> Maaz: Ingress game
[19:02] <Maaz> superfly: Sorry...
[19:02] <magespawn> Who decides the portals?
[19:02] <superfly> Maaz: Google for Ingress game
[19:02] <Maaz> superfly: "Ingress (game) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingress_(game) :: "Why Google's Ingress game is a data gold mine - tech - 29 ..." http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21628936.200-why-googles-ingress-game-is-a-data-gold-mine.html :: "Ingress - Android Apps on Google Play"
[19:02] <Maaz> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nianticproject.ingress :: "Ingress" http://www.ingress.com/ :: "The amazing marketing cam…
[19:02] <superfly> magespawn: you can submit portals
[19:03] <magespawn> So i could seriously rule hluhluwe then
[19:03] <superfly> magespawn: you could
[19:03] <Kilos> by prtal is it light a portal to another universe kinda thing? where peesp just appear outa the air
[19:04] <Kilos> peeps
[19:04] <superfly> Kilos: sort of
[19:04] <Kilos> ah
[19:06] <superfly> Kilos: "Ingress is an augmented reality massively multiplayer online video game created by NianticLabs@Google, released for Android devices."
[19:06] <superfly> "Players of the game belong to one of two factions, “Enlightened” (represented in green) and “Resistance” (blue). The game-play allows players to enclose regions of territory on the surface of the earth with virtual links between virtual portals, which are visible in the game software."
[19:06] <Kilos> sounds interesting
[19:07] <magespawn> They are being quite clever about this.
[19:07] <Kilos> but involved
[19:07] <superfly> "The makers of the game have populated the earth with a large number of “Portals”, visible to those using the game software. They are colored green, blue, or grey, depending on whether they are controlled by the Enlightened, the Resistance, or nobody. They are often associated with landmarks such as public sculptures, libraries, and notable buildings."
[19:07] <superfly> "Each portal may be equipped with up to eight Resonators and four Mods. An unclaimed portal has no resonators. To claim a portal for a faction, a player deploys a resonator on it."
[19:08] <Kilos> oh so your fone actually knows where they are
[19:08] <Kilos> whew
[19:08] <superfly> yes
[19:08] <Kilos> whew
[19:08] <superfly> and you use your phone to "hack" portals and to place resonators in the portals
[19:08] <Kilos> the things are getting too clever
[19:09] <magespawn> Gps is an amazing thing
[19:10] <Kilos> yeah i mapped out a farm outside rustenburg with a garmin years ago
[19:10] <superfly> Kilos: nowadays you can map a farm out with your phone :-)
[19:10] <Kilos> but hte modern ones even talk to you
[19:10] <superfly> yep, I have turn by turn voice navigation on my phone
[19:11] <Kilos> that old garmin was only accurate to within 5 metres
[19:11] <Kilos> haha "jy's verby, draai om"
[19:12] <Kilos> magespawn, whats the prob there
[19:12] <Kilos> same as last time
[19:13] <Kilos> you havent sorted the cables yet
[19:13] <magespawn> Yup there is fault on the hardware section of the network somewhere
[19:14] <magespawn> Busy going though every single port on two 24 port switches
[19:14] <Kilos> sjoe
[19:14] <Kilos> late night in the big city
[19:14] <Kilos> hehe
[19:14] <magespawn> Lol
[19:16] <magespawn> I have put in three switchs to completly bypass the section of the network where the problem is so they are up and running 
[19:16] <Kilos> what part isnt running
[19:16] <Kilos> is every room wored?
[19:16] <Kilos> wired
[19:17] <magespawn> Everything is running at the moment
[19:18] <magespawn> but the problem is between the servers and the switch room that connects the rest of the network
[19:18] <magespawn> Just eliminated the switchs as a problem.
[19:21] <superfly> *switches
[19:21] <superfly> magespawn: a faulty cable?
[19:21] <Kilos> lol
[19:22] <Kilos> rats been chewing on it
[19:29] <Squirm> Kilos: I am now
[19:29] <superfly> Kilos: your feet stink so much it scared my IRC client away!
[19:29] <superfly> gaan was! :-P
[19:30] <Kilos> you are using gnome-sheel hey
[19:30] <Kilos> impossible superfly i walk barefoot all day
[19:30] <Kilos> you sitting down, thats the prob
[19:31] <Kilos> gnome-shell Squirm 
[19:31] <Kilos> or gnome3 thing
[19:32] <Kilos> (Quit: "Eat drums! Eat drums!" - "No Animal, *beat* drums." - "Beat drums! Beat drums!")
[19:32] <Kilos> hehe superfly 
[19:32] <Kilos> they stole your portal
[19:33] <Squirm> Kilos: I use Mint MATE
[19:33] <Kilos> magespawn, you here how the fly is treating me
[19:34] <Kilos> oh my . ok ty Squirm 
[19:34] <Squirm> Kilos: it has a Gnome 2 feel
[19:34] <Squirm> afaik it's a fork of Gnome 2
[19:34] <Kilos> i used mate on unity
[19:34] <Kilos> yes it is
[19:35] <Kilos> i was wondering if the right click format function workks on gnome-shell or gnome3
[19:35] <Kilos> for usb devices that is
[19:36] <Kilos> i think unity has dropped an important function
[19:36] <Kilos> user friendly function that is
[19:41] <magespawn> superfly yes almost certainly just need to find which one in 40 odd or so here
[19:41] <magespawn> with only 10 labled
[19:43] <Kilos> night all. sleep tight
[19:43] <Kilos> good luck magespawn see yous morrow
[21:06] <magespawn> Good night all
[21:51] <inetpro> eish!
