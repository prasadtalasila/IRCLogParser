[00:19] <mhall119> hello mesquka
[00:20] <reindeernix> Hello :D
[00:20] <reindeernix> Everyone in a good mood tonight waiting silently for the source code? ;)
[00:20] <Transhumanist> Popey or others: I don't suppose you can tell us if the developer image for the Galaxy Nexus will be designed for the 3g version, the 4g version, or both? Can you give a specific model number it is guarenteed to work on? (E.g. the model number of the phone you guys currently run it on. Is it GT-I9250?
[00:21] <k1l_> reindeernix: that is gonna be a long night then :)
[00:22] <reindeernix> kil_, who needs sleep anyway? >.<
[00:23] <k1l_> well. i think to end of februar will be a world record then :)
[00:25] <mhall119> Transhumanist: I can ask, besides the radio chip is there much other hardware difference?
[00:27] <mhall119> reindeernix: source code will be released towards the end of February, you might want to get some sleep between now and then
[00:27] <reindeernix> mhall119, yeah I know, just joking
[00:27] <reindeernix> ;)
[00:31] <Transhumanist> mhall119: well, the radio chip is crucial for it to work as a phone
[00:31] <Transhumanist> and if Ubuntu Phone OS doesn't have a driver for 4g, because they've been working on the 3g version, then that makes the phone less useful
[00:32] <Transhumanist> Not useless, but if I have the choice of buying a phone for Ubuntu OS, I may as well choose that which will be the most feature complete under it
[00:32] <Transhumanist> Since my aim is development, a non-functional radio chip doesn't bother me TOO much.
[00:32] <Transhumanist> but still
[00:34] <mhall119> Transhumanist: when it actually ships on a phone, it will support whatever hardware is on the phone, the images we release will be meant for development testing, not day-to-day use
[00:39] <darkham> please... let leak an image before the end of feb '13... it's the type of well working marketing...
[00:40] <Transhumanist> mhall119: I full realise that, but for development testing it's nice to have the main purpose of a phone working ;)
[00:40] <Transhumanist> I don't mean making calls - I mean cellular internet
[00:41] <ubuntubhoy> Surely for most apps usage, wifi would serve just as well for testing
[00:41] <k1l_> Who wants to make calls with a smartphone ? Its all about the Internet :)
[00:42] <ubuntubhoy> lol
[00:42] <ubuntubhoy> voice chat is what GTalk is for :d
[00:42] <M4rtinK> gosh, who would like to call from a smartphone ?
[00:42] <M4rtinK> the time on battery is already bad as is :)
[00:44] <ubuntubhoy> yeah, although mine has been ok the last week or so
[00:53] <Transhumanist> <ubuntubhoy> Surely for most apps usage, wifi would serve just as well for testing
[00:53] <Transhumanist> fair point
[00:54] <Transhumanist> Actually, whenever I go to: a) a workplace, b) university, c) anyone's house, I'm pretty much guarenteed access to wifi. I've found the only time I use 3G is basically bus rides. And even that is changing, with Wifi nodes being installed on buses.
[00:55] <ubuntubhoy> I suppose for apps needing GPS outside 3G is a must
[00:55] <ubuntubhoy> but they are few
[00:55] <ubuntubhoy> also I speak as a user, I could not develop a polaroid instant
[00:55] <ubuntubhoy> (old guy talk)
[00:59] <ubuntubhoy> I actually kept meaning to learn to dev for Android apps, but this could be better
[00:59] <ubuntubhoy> installed QT -creator and will have a look
[02:33] <mhall119> http://vimeo.com/56944191 shows some more performance improvements since the demo last week

[07:43] <mesquka> Hi
=== arij is now known as Guest57774
[08:27] <Ryan45> hello
[08:29] <mesquka> I can't stop shaking, finding it difficult to type
[08:32] <atiti> woooo
[08:35] <atiti> source code is released too?
[08:35] <atiti> sweeeeet
[08:35] <atiti> its gona be epic
[08:51] <Ryan45> hmm
[08:51] <Ryan45> now i am confused
[08:54] <Ryan45> i just read TI gave up on OMAP for phones
[08:56] <Ryan45> So there are litterally no current top of the line devices that Galaxy Nexus is a stepping stone too.
[08:57] <gac> I thought, with it being ARM based, that ARM CPUs from other manufacturers will share the same instruction set anyway?
[08:58] <Ryan45> they do, but the rest of the chips can be different, the rest of the chips that make up the platform
[08:59] <Ryan45> I would think going with the new intel atom reference platform as the base would be better as they could have a lot easier path.
[08:59] <Ryan45> I could be wrong though. I'm not a scientist
[09:01] <gac> hm, yeah, i see what you mean now
[09:02] <Ryan45> This report says intel announced 7 phones for the new atom reference platform
[09:02] <Ryan45> including from ZTE
[09:03] <iobug> Hi All!
[09:03] <Ryan45> hello
[09:04] <iobug> can anybody recommend me a cheap phone for ubuntu :)
[09:04] <Ryan45> gac, can you? :)
[09:04] <gac> nope! :)
[09:04] <gac> i'm merely a user, i know no more about ubuntu on phones than the rest of you guys :P
[09:05] <Ryan45> i'm less then you :)
[09:05] <DaemonicApathy> Don't worry, gac, you're not alone. I'm still upgrading my desktop to make toast.
[09:06] <iobug> samsung galaxy have a required processot, but they are many models....
[09:06] <iobug> processor*
[09:06] <gac> iobug: I think the Galaxy Nexus is (rumoured to be, at least) the first device to have an installable image
[09:07] <gotwig> howdy
[09:07] <gotwig> Can I develop for Ubuntu Phone with Windows 7?
[09:09] <atiti> Intel Atom?
[09:10] <atiti> i doubt that would be a wise choice
[09:10] <Ryan45> atiti they are pursuing a phone reference
[09:10] <Ryan45> it's not the same as the netbook atom
[09:10] <atiti> ok but still, currently arm is owning the phone/tablet market
[09:12] <atiti> ill try to see if i can get ubuntu phone to run on my xperia neo
[09:13] <atiti> sure its not an A9 but a snapdragon
[09:13] <atiti> but i guess as long as the android kernel can be used the userland stuff is probably just armel/armhf anyway
[09:14] <Ryan45> oooh
[09:14] <Ryan45> nice
[09:14] <Ryan45> I must have missed this before
[09:14] <Ryan45> i am an idiot
[09:14] <Ryan45> they specifically mention intel atom
[09:15] <Ryan45> ZTE is doing an atom phone, would probably be a nice path for UP.
[09:21] <atiti> nice
=== dayangkun_ is now known as dayangkun
[15:17] <mhall119> for those wanting CES videos, I'm compiling a list of all the ones I come across here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuPhone#Videos
[15:18] <mhall119> feel free to add any others that I'm missing
[15:19] <Tak> sweet
[15:28] <Robbilie> thanks mhall119 ;)
[15:39] <M4rtinK> thanks ! :)
[15:49] <XenGi> does anyone know if there will be an image for the nexus 4? I would like to test this on mine.
[15:50] <Tak> I imagine that this will be a high-priority target for the community at least
[15:51] <XenGi> i hope so ;)
[15:53] <XenGi> as i understand it i just need the stock android kernel and libs and install the ubuntu rootfs. that should be quite easy.
[16:00] <Lofde_> is there a sign up list yet to be able to get an alpha build to load onto my galaxy nexus..
=== Guest57774 is now known as arij
[16:07] <mhall119> Lofde_: no, once there's something available we'll make it available to everybody
[16:08] <Lofde_> i was hoping you might be supporting alpha developers and testers.. *shrug*
[16:54] <mhall119> Lofde_: we are, we're just supporting alpha developers and testers *and* everybody else at the same time
[16:55] <Lofde_> yeah i understand that you probably are working with channel partners and manufactures, but this is the coolest idea that i dont have to run the OS on my phone if i want to.. theres still some things i wonder if i would actually like with ubuntu phone but i am excited to at least give it a try! i like choices!
[17:00] <mhall119> Lofde_: as far as I know, the images that will be released next month will be the first anybody outside of the development team has access to them
[17:02] <Lofde_> awesomeness
[17:04] <tom123> does the phone support android apps? this would be great, then ubuntu would have all the famous apps a lot of people would miss...
[17:05] <mhall119> tom123: no, there won't be a Dalvik Java VM on the Ubuntu Phone
[17:05] <mhall119> you can write native apps or webapps for it though
[17:05] <tom123> so using a vm in the ubuntu phone would be the only soultion?^^
[17:07] <mhall119> tom123: Android apps are Java apps running in their specific VM, so yes
[17:10] <tom123> mhall119: ok thx for the information
[17:10] <mhall119> np
[17:12] <tom123> mhall119: but are there any specific reasons for not supporting this? i mean, android is licensed under gpl isnt it?
[17:13] <mhall119> tom123: because it would be a constant game of catch-up, we wouldn't be able to offer anything better than the Android APIs, they wouldn't work on other form-factors like desktop or TV, and nobody would bother to write native Ubuntu apps
[17:13] <mhall119> is the short list :)
[17:14] <mhall119> In the end, we want to make Ubuntu on Phones, not another way of providing Android on phones
[17:15] <tom123> yeah, but maybe it is easier to convince people for the first time^^
[17:16] <tom123> i mean, the first step is to get more people using the ubuntu phone, isnt it?
[17:23] <mhall119> Yes, but if they use Ubuntu Phone because it has Android apps, then we can't ever stop having Android apps
[17:23] <mhall119> and as long as we have Android apps, nobody will write Ubuntu apps for it
[17:23] <mhall119> so while it might make the first step easier, it's a long-term commitment to the wrong path
[17:25] <mhall119> and again, we want to offer something *better* than Android
[17:26] <atiti> :D
[17:27] <atiti> cant wait to get my hands on the code
[17:29] <tom123> mhall119: ok thx again for the explanation:)
[17:31] <user82> colegues of me are at CES. why not me i want to see the phone :D
[17:31] <user82> any new videos from there ?
[17:35] <mhall119> user82: I'm collecting video links here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuPhone#Videos
[17:35] <mhall119> as you can see, there is already a number of CES ones
[17:35] <user82> cool mhall119  thanks
[17:35] <user82> any news else? images release date etc?
[17:36] <mhall119> user82: "late February" for images and source code
[17:36] <user82> works for me..end of may i want to buy a new phone.
[17:36] <user82> then there will be some versions i think for different phones
[17:46] <Lofde_> i was wondering how ubuntu phone is handling the lock screen.. to keep the phone from being used by other people is there a video describing that?
[17:50] <Lofde_> and using the MHL will you be able to connect a HDMI screen, and for a keyboard and mouse maybe bluetooth?
[17:51] <Lofde_> haha my next phone will be my desktop/laptop/tablet.. i wonder if verizon will care if i run services like SSH/VNC/FTP on that 4gLTE :)
[18:00] <mhall119> Lofde_: you will be able to dock the phone and get a full Ubuntu desktop, yes
[18:01] <mhall119> as long as you pay-per-usage data plan with Verizon, I'm sure they'll be happy for you to use as much of it as you can :)
[18:01] <Lofde_> i wish some of these youtube videos the reporters or press would have used an HD camera to shoot the video on youtube..
[18:01] <atiti> how about contacts
[18:01] <Lofde_> $30 unlimited data ... i hope i could still free  tether like i can with my rooted gnex :)
[18:01] <atiti> will the be synchronised?
[18:02] <Lofde_> oh yeah i didnt think about syncing all my google contacts .. thats a must.. and facebook too i like to import all those numbers with faces into the phone.. i had to use the FriendCaster facebook app with the nexus there for a while since facebook was being a !@#$
[18:04] <m3talsmith> So it's really going to take until febuary to get the source code out?
[18:04] <m3talsmith> *february
[18:06] <xperiasuser> hey guys
[18:07] <m3talsmith> hi xperiasuser
[18:32] <ubuntubhoy> does anyone know if the Gwibber desktop service is included in Ubuntu phone OS ?
[18:35] <mhall119> ubuntubhoy: it's going to be called "Friends", but I assume it will be, yes
[18:36] <ubuntubhoy> nice
[18:36] <Ryan45> lol, friends
[18:38] <Ryan45> I just hope the end game of this is an unlocked phone store
[18:38] <Ryan45> for the US
[18:39] <ubuntubhoy> I guess a lot of that will be down to carriers
[18:39] <mhall119> Ryan45: unlocked phone, or unlocked app store?
[18:40] <ubuntubhoy> The app store needs to be regulated
[18:41] <ubuntubhoy> otherwise you end up with malicious apps
[18:43] <mhall119> apps will be sandboxed as well, so reduce the threat even if you do end up installing something dangerous
[18:44] <ubuntubhoy> the handset is not as big a deal, if it carries a warranty warning the way the Nexus devices do
[18:44] <ubuntubhoy> or do you mean unlocked as in SIM free ?
[18:51] <ubuntubhoy> mhall119: on the 'app store', will it be a filtered version of Software Centre ?
[18:52] <mhall119> ubuntubhoy: Those details haven't been decided yet
[18:53] <ubuntubhoy> it would kind of make sense as apps can be cross device I suppose
[18:53] <mhall119> Obviously we don't want to recommend apps for your phone that won't be usuable on it
[18:53] <ubuntubhoy> true
[18:53] <mhall119> but, on the other hand, you can dock your phone and get a full desktop or TV, so maybe it will be usable then
[18:53] <ubuntubhoy> but at the same time, why run two or more stores
[18:53] <mhall119> like I said, those details haven't been sorted out yet
[18:54] <mhall119> ubuntubhoy: It won't likely be multiple stores, but perhaps separate archives or just flags in the package meta-data that can be used for filtering/sorting
[20:19] <Lofde_> i guess it depends who ubuntu tries to target with this phone to... i think if they just focus on the cool developer , android kids who love hacking with their phones instead of any old grandma.. it would probably push the phone further.. once someones like oo look what my new iphone 5 can do.. a person can get out their ubuntu pc-phone and be like yeah well thats cool
[20:19] <bobweaver> I need help woith the Import plugin that canonical made in house
[20:19] <bobweaver> It is all installed but it does not work
[20:20] <bobweaver> I have tried on 3 different kind's of Qt versions all >5
[20:21] <bobweaver> I have tried adding the path to my pro files and for simple programs to my qmlprojects file
[20:22] <bobweaver> WHY IN THE ***** would anyone make plugins that are for on one spific version of qt and then on top of that only make that version avilible to on series of the distro
[20:22] <bobweaver> a beta version at that
[20:23] <bobweaver> I just wasted 6 hours debuging to find out that it is about effin fonts
[20:25] <bobweaver> I am feed up with the overall wakeyness to all these imports and am just going to port to qt5.0.0.rc
[20:26] <bobweaver> No one knows why this is happening ?
[20:27] <krabador> now i think i can't introduce this , in a different way : please try to build images for Samsung Galaxy S2 !!!!!!! :)
[20:28] <bobweaver> So this is what it comes down to. Who ever made this is tieing developers down to this. You must be using a beta version of qt5 you must be using 11.10 if you want to use ppa. You Must not use the new and STABLE version of qt because it is missing fonts lib that some obscure version of qt has
[20:29] <bobweaver> and the wiki tells you to set you bashrc to export your qt versions ... that is not good you an do all this from ones pro file or qmlproject file
[20:30] <bobweaver> but then again I am the one with errors here
[20:31] <mhall119> bobweaver: I'm sure it wasn't by design, sometimes quick hacks become legacy code
[20:32] <bobweaver> mhall119,  (I have all this code that I want to make/port to the phone but I can not do this and you know me and you  know that I am not a n00b with qt-quick
[20:33] <bobweaver> But the thing that I dont get is I have the beta version install from daily ppa I have had it install for months
[20:34] <bobweaver> I also have the plugings in stalled there I also have qt4,7+ qt5.0.0.rc
[20:34] <bobweaver> I try to use the qt that is from beta ppa that has the imports installed to the imports folder
[20:35] <bobweaver> and I still get errors about fonts !
[20:36] <ubuntubhoy> <-- un-informed buffoon so beyond me mate
[20:37] <ubuntubhoy> Question though, as apps are cross device (hardware dependant) are they simply known as 'Ubuntu Apps' ?
[20:37] <bobweaver> I am not mad I am more trying to raise awareness to this issue So that if more qt/qtquick devs come along they wont have the same thing happen to them
[20:37] <ubuntubhoy> I guess if you work it out then submit the info to the dev pages
[20:37] <bobweaver> I am going to do that ubuntubhoy
[20:38] <bobweaver> I am going to make the plugins/import lib for qt5.0.0.rc you know the FINAL release of qt5
[20:38] <ubuntubhoy> I am still trying to read through the Currency converter tut and make sense of it
[20:39] <ubuntubhoy> 4.8.3 on the download page
[20:40] <bobweaver> but then comes the trouble of telling people to install the qt from nokia site. People are not going to like that. Not sure why all this effort is is going into 5 beta 1   not even beta 2
[20:40] <bobweaver> ubuntubhoy,  you are looking at the wrong page then
[20:40] <ubuntubhoy> hmm
[20:40] <bobweaver> http://qt-project.org/wiki/Qt_5.0
[20:40] <ubuntubhoy> my bad, that's the version that the linked QT-Creator is based on
[20:40] <bobweaver> see beta one was released  August 30, 2012.
[20:41] <bobweaver> I think that qt4 is like 7 years old now
[20:42] <bobweaver> maybe even older or younger give or take a year or two
[20:42] <ubuntubhoy> It does say QT5 on the page though
[20:42] <bobweaver> ubuntubhoy,  see this would also be a problem to tell people to download something that is not in UDC
[20:45] <ubuntubhoy> All I know is I am using the stuff from here
[20:45] <ubuntubhoy> http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/app-developer-cookbook/mobile/currency-converter-phone-app/
[20:45] <ubuntubhoy> but I will never dev anything other than really simple stuff
[20:57] <bobweaver> file:///home/joseph/Qt5/5.0.0-rc1/gcc/imports/Ubuntu/Components/qmldir: plugin cannot be loaded for module ".home.joseph.Qt5.5.0.0-rc1.gcc.imports.Ubuntu.Components": Module namespace 'Ubuntu.Components' does not match import URI '.home.joseph.Qt5.5.0.0-rc1.gcc.imports.Ubuntu.Components'          SNAP

[21:52] <squabbi> hello
[23:26] <bobweaver> I finally Got it working I had to change the way that theming was being built. I now have it all running on Ubuntu 12.04 with qt5 stable . Now for the Fun part Making some Apps.
[23:31] <ubuntubhoy> lol
[23:31] <ubuntubhoy> hope you will be posting your fix
[23:34] <ubuntubhoy> you got anything particular in mind bobweaver
[23:35] <bobweaver> well I have been working on some media stuf
[23:35] <ubuntubhoy> so port it over then
[23:35] <ubuntubhoy> I would really like to see some decent social media apps
[23:35] <ubuntubhoy> that transpose well to the desktop

[23:44] <bobweaver> ubuntubhoy,  do you know how to use WebView in Qml ?
[23:44] <ubuntubhoy> yeah, Russell has been fawning over it
[23:44] <ubuntubhoy> bobweaver: I don't know how to do jack s**t in Qml
[23:44] <bobweaver> cool
[23:45] <ubuntubhoy> sorry
[23:45] <ubuntubhoy> as I said, just hoping to learn enough to create some very simple apps
