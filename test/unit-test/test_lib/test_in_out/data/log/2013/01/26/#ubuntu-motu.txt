[02:02] <artfwo> what is the current preferred way for a sponsored package upgrade? udd or debdiff?
[02:22] <cjohnston> artfwo: udd is what they are promoting, but I have done both in the last couple weeks
[02:24] <artfwo> cjohnston, thanks, so debdiffs are still in use
[02:31] <cjohnston> artfwo: yes

[17:43] <lfaraone> If someone is entirely new to working on debian packages and wants to fix a Launchpad bug, what doc should I point them to?
[17:43] <tumbleweed> the ubuntu packaging guide
[17:43] <tumbleweed> !packaging guide
[17:43] <ubottu> The packaging guide is at http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/  - See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/NewPackages for information on getting a package integrated into Ubuntu - Other developer resources are at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment - See also !backports and !sponsoring
[17:44] <tumbleweed> by a "launchpad bug" I assume you mean something Ubuntu-related
[18:22] <lfaraone> tumbleweed: Yes.

[23:23] <lfaraone> soooooo gratuitiously expensive sushi, or pizza?
[23:31] <ESphynx> lfaraone: I'm going for pizza myself tonight.
[23:31] <ESphynx> despite my utter love for sushi.
[23:31] <lfaraone> oops, wrong iwndow.
[23:31] <ESphynx> =)
[23:31] <lfaraone> although it was food for an Ubuntu hackathon!

[23:32] <ESphynx> lfaraone: same here.
[23:33] <ESphynx> let's both have pizzas for our Ubuntu hackathon =0
[23:33] <ESphynx> it's totally on-topic.
[23:36] <lfaraone> ESphynx: We ended up ordering from http://beautys-pizza.com/. I wonder if they deliver to you.
[23:40] <ESphynx> lfaraone: Oh I doubt so, I'm in Qu√©bec, Canada ... I'm all set with my Ristorante pizza in the freezer =) and a 2nd other brand as backup.
[23:40] <ESphynx> however it's 6:37PM and i haven't eaten breakfast yet, so I was going to go for bacon & eggs & sausages & toasts first
[23:40] <ESphynx> it's going to be an allnighter hackathon.
