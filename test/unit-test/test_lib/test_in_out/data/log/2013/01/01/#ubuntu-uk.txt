[00:00] <penguin42> Happy new year!
[00:00] <neuro> happy new year folks!
[00:00] <daftykins> +1
[00:00] <Azelphur> happy new year :p
[00:01] <daftykins> yes irssi, day changed indeed.
[00:01] <Azelphur> good news everyone, we didn't die
[00:03] <daftykins> bad news, yet
[00:03] <neuro> and one of my potential new years resolutions has gone right out the window already as I've lit up my first marlboro gold of 2013 :)
[00:04] <Azelphur> neuro: haha
[00:04] <daftykins> tut tut!
[00:04] <penguin42> tsk
[00:04] <Azelphur> I beat my last years resolution \m/
[00:04] <daftykins> was it spend more time on IRC?
[00:04] <daftykins> 8D
[00:04] <Azelphur> haha
[00:05] <neuro> holy fireworks, batman
[00:05] <neuro> i think edinburgh just exploded
[00:05] <neuro> and now they're going to try a mass singalong, doing Auld Lang Syne with 75K folk
[00:05] <neuro> nutters
[00:05] <daftykins> crazy
[00:05] <daftykins> and you lot want to be your own country
[00:06] <daftykins> woot the...
[00:06] <neuro> I KNOW
[00:06] <daftykins> :D
[00:06] <neuro> i used to watch jools holland on hogmanay, but he's not been booking the best acts in the last couple of years, and when you know it's prerecorded, it kinda loses something when they ring in the bells
[00:07] <neuro> at least we in scotland put in some effort
[00:07] <neuro> i notice the bbc england/national thing is just like 15 mins long with gaby logan saying "here's some fireworks over london, um bye"
[00:07] <daftykins> those hootenanny progs he does are recorded!?
[00:08] <neuro> yup
[00:08] <daftykins> i suppose that explains why randomer band types want to be there on new years XD
[00:08] <neuro> wow, princes street is PACKED
[00:09] <neuro> and now phil cunningham and ali bain playing some shetland choons! it MUST be the new year!
[00:10] <daftykins> never heard of 'em 0o
[00:12] <dwatkins> they certainly let off a lot of fireworks here in Edinburgh, 5 minutes o constant kabooms
[00:20] <neuro> dwatkins: aye, saw the on the telly, looked prety epic
[00:20] <neuro> whereaboots in embra are ye?
[00:26]  * dwatkins is in Tollcross, about a mile from the castle
[00:26] <dwatkins> possibly less
[00:26] <neuro> aye, know it well
[00:27] <neuro> used to work beside festival square, then up west port
[00:29] <dwatkins> ah yes, nor far from me
[00:30] <dwatkins> I'm really lucky - I work in Sighthill, so can cycle along the Union canal to get to work, and encounter very little actual road
[01:05] <penguin42> wth does Scotland have 2nd as a bank holiday anyway?
[01:22] <Whoop> same reason England has the 1st...because its an arbitary date someone concluded is special
[01:23] <penguin42> but I can't quite see the reason to have 2 days, except if the 2nd one is just to recover from the celebrations on the 1st
[01:24] <Whoop> I can't quite see the reason to have 1 day, except if the 1st one is just to recover from the year
[01:25] <penguin42> hmm I see your point; 1 day isn't really enough to recover from a year
[01:26] <Whoop> Sounds like you just gave yourself reasoning for Scotlands 2nd day
[01:26] <penguin42> yeh

[11:34] <kvarley> Happy new year ubuntu-ers :)
[11:35] <kvarley> MartijnVdS: It's like the 2000 bug? Is the Linux Kernel ready for this?
[11:36] <dwatkins> The 64-bit kernel should be, considering the 2038 bug is a limit in the representation of time as a 32-bit number.
[11:37] <MartijnVdS> some programs might not be though

[12:01] <dogmatic69> anyone know what the countdown is for?
[12:01] <dogmatic69> http://www.ubuntu.com/
[12:01] <MartijnVdS> dogmatic69: I've seen guesses. Mostly "Canonical's own tablet"
[12:02] <dogmatic69> ah
[12:02] <dogmatic69> strange timing I think.
[12:02] <MartijnVdS> hence the "you an almost touch it"
[12:09] <AlanBell> I am guessing phone
[12:09] <AlanBell> tablet would just annoy everyone who bought a nexus 7 at UDS
[12:09] <MartijnVdS> AlanBell: a TV .. with TOUCH
[12:09] <AlanBell> or that
[12:09] <AlanBell> fingerprints ahoy
[12:14] <jacobw> a dell ubuntu laptop with an ubuntu key
[12:16] <MartijnVdS> ubuntu key?
[12:16] <MartijnVdS> So you can install the ad-free version of Ubuntu?
[12:17] <jacobw> instead of the windws key
[12:18] <AlanBell> even the sputnik that they spent 8 months working on came out with a windows key on it
=== Lcawte|Away is now known as Lcawte
[12:20] <AlanBell> wonder if whatever it is will run gnome shell
[12:21] <jacobw> why?
[12:24] <dwatkins> I have no windows key on my IBM Model M keyboard ;)
[12:25] <apacheuk> I have a Ubuntu key on my FILCO keyboard :)
[12:26] <brobostigon> why not have a haiku-key , as that superkey, :)
[12:29] <dwatkins> apacheuk: I'm very tempted to get one of those keyboards and make it look like a BBC Micro (red function keys)
[12:40] <apacheuk> dwatkins, I love it... thinking about trying to persuade work into getting me one
[12:41] <dwatkins> apacheuk: I'm still not sure where to get red function key caps, but I discovere a whole 'nother world of people installing custom coloured caps with specific fonts and all sorts of other keyboard bling :)
[12:55] <apacheuk> dwatkins, FILCO do sell different colour keys
[12:58] <dwatkins> aha, handy

[13:55] <ali1234> 9 days after christmas is a spectacularly bad time to release a piece of hardware
[13:55] <mfraz74> 1st April is a bad time to release hardware too
[13:56] <popey> who's releasing new heardware 9 days after christmas?
[13:56] <ali1234> nobody
[13:57] <penguin42> so the comment that it is a spectacularly bad time to do it was just a random observation?
[13:57] <ali1234> yes
[13:58] <penguin42> riiiiiight
[14:11] <dwatkins> Dell are probably about to release a new line of 27" monitors - they were selling the previous line off cheap until christmas eve
[14:12] <penguin42> they often do cycles of discounting their monitors though
[14:13] <dwatkins> yeah, I wasn't complaining at 40% off
[14:13] <penguin42> oh nice; was that the 1920x1080/1200 or the higher res ones?
[14:13] <dwatkins> higher res, iirc
[14:14] <dwatkins> http://www.hotukdeals.com/deals/dell-27-ultrasharp-monitor-offer-with-coupon-looks-pretty-good-for-spec-382-08-delivered-1406844
[14:15] <penguin42> oh nice, that might be just about a record for that res
[14:16] <dwatkins> in terms of the price? perhaps
[14:16] <dwatkins> "1kg cartons of Ambrosia custard 50p as ASDA" - that site has some fantastic deals ;)
[14:16]  * penguin42 keeps a little note of cheapest prices for size of monitors (I wish I'd kept the historic data), cheapest I'd had for a 27 2560x1440 was 414 a year or two ago
[14:17] <dwatkins> aha neat
[14:17]  * penguin42 isn't sure he could actually justify to himself buying another LCD, my 24" 1920x1080 is enough, although more pixels is always nice
[14:17] <dwatkins> It was a tough choice for me.
[14:18] <penguin42> dwatkins: Well yes, the choice between custard and cream....
[14:18] <dwatkins> hehe
[14:18] <dwatkins> I'll use my current monitor as a secondary display
[14:19] <penguin42> what's your current display?
[14:19] <dwatkins> Dell 2001FP
[14:19] <dwatkins> 20" iirc, 1920x1080
[14:20] <penguin42> os is that a 1600x1200 one?
[14:21] <penguin42> I've got a couple of old 2000FP's at work
[14:21] <dwatkins> oh sorry, yeah - 1600x1200

[17:56] <mgdm> where on earth are my core files going?
[17:56] <mgdm> I've killed whoopsie, and now I don't seem to find them anywhere
[17:56] <mgdm> which makes debugging segfaults in code annoying
[17:57] <directhex> mgdm, nowhere by default, no?
[17:58] <mgdm> well, on every system I've ever used, I've done 'ulimit -c unlimited', and core files then appeared in the current dir
[17:58] <directhex> you need to set a core pattern too
[17:58] <directhex> http://sigquit.wordpress.com/2009/03/13/the-core-pattern/
[17:59] <mgdm> Ooooh, so that's been changed in this release to pipe to apport
[18:00] <mgdm> fixed now, ta
[19:05] <Azelphur> what's the countdown on ubuntu.com about? o.o
[19:05] <popey> â˜º
[19:06] <Azelphur> countdown to smiley face, just what I always wanted
[19:08] <czajkowski> popey: you use thunderbird right?
[19:08] <popey> ya
[19:09] <czajkowski> popey: have you had to back up all your mail yet on there and been able to restore it?
[19:09] <popey> yes, by backing up my entire home directory
[19:09] <czajkowski> ahhh
[19:10] <czajkowski> not done that before
[19:10] <czajkowski> and need to do that before tomorrow to my external Hd
[19:10] <popey> my laptop gets backed up daily
[19:10] <popey> so I don't need to worry about it
[19:10] <czajkowski> what do you use?
[19:10] <popey> rsnapshot on a remote machine
[19:11] <czajkowski> hmm not heard of that
[19:11] <czajkowski> shall cook dinner and be nice to Jon to see if he'll help
[19:12] <czajkowski> also need to make sure my ssh keys are backed up
[19:13] <popey> I'd just boot off a live cd/usb and copy all of /home to the external device
[19:13] <AlanBell> rsnapshot and rdiffbackup allow you to do daily incremental backups
[19:13] <AlanBell> if you want a one hit grab everything for a warranty return then I wouldn't bother trying anything complicated
[19:14] <popey> ditto
[19:14] <czajkowski> nods
[19:15] <czajkowski> they could have sheldon for up to 10 days
[19:15] <czajkowski> need to get life back into old tosh for work and email or maybe see if I can use Jons other Macbook
[19:55] <AlanBell> never borrow a macbook when your laptop is broken. The smugness will be overpowering :)
[20:31] <daubers> Has anyone in here competed in Ludum Dare?
[20:32] <popey> gord has i think
[20:32] <daubers> I'm considering attempting the next one
[20:32] <popey> I want to do http://www.onegameamonth.com/
[20:33] <daubers> That is also quite cool
[20:33] <daubers> Not sure I could put the commitment in at that level continuously though
[20:35]  * daubers subs to the reddit
[21:07] <Whoop> Azelphur: The wording and rumours would suggest they're releasing a touch device of some description
[21:07] <Whoop> also the recent unity alterations
[21:07] <Azelphur> yea, I got that far :)
[21:12] <jacobw> what unity alterations?
[21:37] <Whoop> Nothing specific, just Unity in general over the last few releasese
[21:37] <Whoop> everything focused around touch
[21:42] <popey> it has?
[21:52] <ali1234> popey: why do you keep asking leading questions?
[21:53] <ali1234> we all know you're not going to tell us :/
[21:53] <ali1234> i don't think it will be hardware personally
[21:55] <ali1234> it might be a new version of unity that is designed for touchscreens
[21:56] <ali1234> it might also be a cloud desktop for ubuntu one subscribers
[21:56] <popey> I'm not.
[21:56] <popey> Whoop suggested that we've added more focus around touch
[21:56] <popey> i wanted to know how we have done that
[21:57] <ali1234> it says "touch" on the front page on ubunt.com in big letters
[21:58] <ali1234> the unity alterations are conspicuously absent
[21:59] <Whoop> popey: larger icons, docks, touch apis etc
[21:59] <ali1234> remember when nobody could figure out how to rearrange icons on unity?
[21:59] <ali1234> cos you have to drag them to the side, "off" the launcher
[21:59] <ali1234> i realised today this is a touch gesture
[21:59] <popey> yeah, that was the original design..
[22:00] <ali1234> doing that under windows 7 does the same thing as right clicking
[22:00] <Whoop> popey: sure, they keep iterrating on it
[22:00] <ali1234> obviously you cannot right click with a touch screen
[22:00] <popey> heh, I never knew it did that on windows 7
[22:00] <popey> well, right click is long press isnt it?
[22:00] <ali1234> sometimes
[22:00] <ali1234> but swiping up on the icons, "swipes" open the menu
[22:00] <ali1234> it's better than long clicking
[22:01] <ali1234> you actually see the menu swipe up with your finger, at the same speed
[22:01] <ali1234> it's quite good
[22:01] <ali1234> well, with te mouse in this case
[22:01] <popey> yeah, it's very nice
[22:01]  * popey is on w7 atm
[22:01] <popey> just tried it having never seen it before
[22:01] <ali1234> yeah i only saw it today, setting up a new wndows 7 machine
[22:03] <popey> Whoop: it's certainly improving, but I've not seen any additional touch stuff added in the last few releases
[22:03] <ali1234> how's that nexus 7 project coming along?
[22:04] <ali1234> last i checked it wasn't anywhere close to being usable?
[22:06] <ali1234> actually if you read between the lines of the faq for that it makes some kind of sense
[22:07] <ali1234> "The focus of this project is on the core of the OS, so there are no plans to support shells at this time."
[22:07] <ali1234> "As of now, we can not change the UI to make it more touch friendly."
[22:07] <ali1234> if i read between those lines, which you all know i love to do, i read "because there's a team working on it in secret, which would make any work we do pointless."
[22:10] <popey> heh
[22:16] <DJones> ali1234: Maybe its tomorrows announcement
[22:17] <daftykins> http://www.irc-junkie.org/2013-01-01/efnet-faces-major-attack-on-new-years-eve/
[22:17] <daftykins> Efnet got owned a tad :>
[22:20] <ali1234> DJones: um, yeah, that's what i meant :)
[23:00] <czajkowski> popey: AlanBell all done we were able to copy over my /home to old tosh :)
[23:00] <popey> yay
[23:01] <czajkowski> forgot how heavy old tosh is
[23:01] <daftykins> you had a computer death?
[23:01] <czajkowski> but think in a few weeks I'll actually set up a desktop for home work and then use lappy for travel
[23:02] <czajkowski> daftykins: nope but backlights kinda flickering on and off so it's going to get some TLC as it's just about under warranty
[23:02] <daftykins> ah strange one
[23:03] <czajkowski> aye and not what I needed the week I go back to work :)
[23:03] <czajkowski> so mid panic
[23:03] <czajkowski> but it's all sorted
[23:03] <daftykins> good stuff
[23:03] <czajkowski> hmm my keyring didn't unlock
[23:03] <czajkowski> what pesky keyring is it talking about
[23:05] <AlanBell> gnome keyring
[23:05] <AlanBell> with wifi passwords and stuff in it
[23:05] <czajkowski> hmmm
[23:05] <czajkowski> possibly
[23:06] <czajkowski> if so no idea why it's asking for it
[23:06] <czajkowski> as that wasn't  a set up on Sheldon
[23:06] <daftykins> wifi hardware change prompted a surprise perhaps
[23:06] <czajkowski> perhaps
[23:06] <popey> did you setup a new user with the same password as on the old computer?
[23:08] <czajkowski> yes
[23:08] <popey> odd
[23:08] <popey> it should unlock when you login
[23:08] <czajkowski> yup
[23:08] <czajkowski> that's what I would have thought
[23:09] <czajkowski> still tis working for the next few days till sheldon comes back to me
[23:09] <czajkowski> Nn folks
[23:09] <popey> you can just open seahorse to fix it
[23:09] <czajkowski> popey: will look into that tomorrow
[23:09] <czajkowski> cheers
[23:09] <czajkowski> :)
