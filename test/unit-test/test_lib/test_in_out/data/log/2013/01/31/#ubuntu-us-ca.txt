[18:12] <Torikun> I am almos done installing Ubuntu on N7
[18:12] <Torikun> I might actually use this tablet now lol
[18:12] <Torikun> any bad issues to expect?
[18:20] <nhaines> There's no touch UI.
[18:20] <Torikun> huh
[18:20] <Torikun> it just booted for the first time and teh screen all jacked up
[18:20] <nhaines> Make that two issues then.
[18:20] <Torikun> touch screen working
[18:21] <raevol> down to one again
[18:21] <nhaines> It works, there's just no touch-optimized UI.
[18:21] <raevol> one and a half
[18:21] <Torikun> oh
[18:21] <nhaines> Run updates.  Hopefully they fixed something.  :)
[18:21] <Torikun> you dont run it anymore?
[18:22] <nhaines> I don't run Ubuntu on a tablet.  Because there's no touch UI.
[18:22] <nhaines> If I wanted to be furious at an user interface I could install Windows 8.  :)
[18:22] <Torikun> lolol
[18:22] <nhaines> (Which is actually awesome on a touchscreen.)
[18:28] <Torikun> Desktop just loaded!
[18:28] <Torikun> everything looks ood
[18:28] <akk> This is sounding like a seriously slow boot.
[18:29] <Torikun> lol
[18:30] <Torikun> wifi suspends when screen is off =(
[18:34] <nhaines> You're probably not surfing the interblags when the screen's off anyway.
[18:34] <Torikun> it's pretty neat hving unity on the tablet
[18:34] <Torikun> keyboard is much better
[18:35] <Torikun> than android
[18:35] <pleia2> Torikun: 12.10 or 13.04?
[18:35] <Torikun> looks liek 13.04
[18:35] <pleia2> the point of the tablet version isn't end user use :) it's a developer version so they can make improvements to the UI
[18:36] <Torikun> lol
[18:36] <pleia2> I think they're shooting for usable-by-muggles for 14.04
[18:36] <Torikun> oh
[18:36] <Torikun> what version do you ahve installed pleia2
[18:36] <pleia2> I don't
[18:36] <pleia2> played with them at UDS a couple months back though
[18:36] <Torikun> o
[18:37] <nhaines> Unity being focused on touch-screens was a slander invented by people who didn't like it in 11.04, and it hasn't become less untrue since.
[18:37] <pleia2> (I don't have a tablet of any kind)
[18:37] <nhaines> pleia2: I got to play with a Nexus 7 yesterday.  It was nice.  :)
[18:37] <pleia2> nhaines: but so small! if I do make the tablet plunge it'll probably be the 10
[18:37] <Torikun> Tablets are over rated
[18:38] <Torikun> I would be happier with a macbook air lol
[18:38] <nhaines> pleia2: the 10's probably the way to go.  As nice as the 7 inch was, the 10 must be luxurious.
[18:38] <pleia2> but really I'm quite happy with phone+netbook for on the go stuff still
[18:38] <nhaines> pleia2: me too.  But the idea of Ubuntu everywhere makes me happy.  I love Android on my phone but I'm not convinced tablet-wise.
[18:38] <pleia2> I can't do on screen keyboards and most of my work and fun needs a keyboard
[18:38] <pleia2> so I could get a tablet and carry a keyboard and... well at that point I have a netbook again
[18:39] <Torikun> you need a macbook air
[18:39] <Torikun> lol
[18:39] <pleia2> I really don't
[18:39] <Torikun> problem solved
[18:39] <pleia2> my ultrabook is similar to the macbook air, but has a useful operating system on it
[18:39] <pleia2> but it's too big to put in my purse (my netbook fits)
[18:39] <Torikun> ajh
[18:40] <nhaines> pleia2: onscreen keyboards make me want to punch a kitten.  The Android 4.2 keyboard is a nice alternative to Swype however!
[18:40] <Torikun> yeah
[18:40] <Torikun> word
[18:40] <pleia2> nhaines: I tried the swypey keyboards, do not grok
[18:40] <nhaines> pleia2: it's like touch typing with your thumb.  :)
[18:40] <pleia2> I just tether to my netbook when I need to type more than a sentence :)
[18:40] <Torikun> lol
[18:41] <pleia2> or say "they can wait until I get home"
[18:43] <Torikun> lol desktop locked up I gotta wait until the battery dies now lol
[19:07] <Torikun> nhaines: it was horrible uninstalling it
[19:12] <nhaines> Torikun: uninstalling Ubuntu or Android?
[19:12] <nhaines> YokoZar: heya.  :)
[19:12] <Torikun> Uninstalling Ubuntu
[19:12] <Torikun> going back to android
[19:13] <Torikun> i was hoping it would be somewhat usable
[19:14] <nhaines> It should have been.
[19:14] <Torikun> nope
[19:14] <nhaines> Just slow.
[19:14] <Torikun> oh very slow
[19:14] <Torikun> and keyboard would not appear when needed
[19:14] <Torikun> and unity screen would be locked and you can not close it
[19:14] <Torikun> *application screen
[19:15] <Torikun> 4 CPU's in the n7 and it runs so slow
[19:17] <Torikun> and keyboard on unity too small
[19:33] <Torikun> nhaines: got a raspberry pi?
[19:34] <nhaines> Torikun:I really want one but have absolutely no use for one.
[19:35] <Torikun> haha I understand that
[19:36] <nhaines> Torikun: didn't stop me from buying bitcoin, but eh...  :)
[19:36] <Torikun> lolololololol
[19:36] <Torikun> How is bit coin doing
[19:37] <pleia2> heh, jyo had a backpack full of 'em at a global jam event, that's how I ended up with one (it sits next to my desktop and runs an irc bot that does nothing)
[19:37] <Torikun> lol
[19:37] <pleia2> re: I wanted one but still have absolutely no use for one
[19:37] <Torikun> http://www.linux-toys.com that's what I did with them
[19:37] <darthrobot> Title: [Linux-toys.com | .....another techy Linux blog.]
[19:37] <Torikun> it's great for an irc bouncer pleia2
[19:38] <pleia2> I don't use bouncers
[19:38] <pleia2> I run screen+irssi on my VPS
[19:38] <Torikun> lol that's not as efficient
[19:38] <pleia2> I guess it depends on what you're doing :)
[19:38] <Torikun> lol yeah
[19:38] <Torikun> with bouncers, you can use any client app
[19:39] <pleia2> any client app that has support for over 100 channels, sure!
[19:39] <pleia2> most suck at it though
[19:39] <Torikun> oh
[19:40] <Torikun> performance is terrible on the pi
[19:40] <nhaines> Torikun: bitcoin hit $20 overnight after fighting it for three days and is now worth $21.35.
[19:40] <Torikun> ah
[19:41] <nhaines> I've made a couple dollars and the sooner people accept it and just buy my trade orders at bitfloor I'll have another half a dollar.  :)
[19:41] <pleia2> nhaines: w00t, early retirement!
[19:42] <pleia2> :)
[19:42] <Torikun> you guys play with yacy?
[19:42]  * Torikun did not mean to sound sexist there lol
[19:43] <nhaines> pleia2: haha.  Well, it's fun and then once I get a tiny bit I push it to bitzino.com where I can lose it in the slickest HTML5 Blackjack interface you've ever seen.  ;)
[19:44] <pleia2> nhaines: haha, we'll that's something :)
[19:45] <nhaines> pleia2: it even runs on my Nintendo 3DS browser!
[19:45] <nhaines> Note: this is the worst way to play blackjack.
[19:45] <pleia2> lol
[19:59] <YokoZar> email: Plz.. i need enter to the group to learn with the users, im new in ubuntu dev and i need some experiencie...
[19:59] <YokoZar> me: What exactly are you talking about or asking me to do?
[19:59] <YokoZar> email: I need a group to start to develop for ubuntu but i dont know how start, and i need the code
[19:59] <Torikun> http://sitedown.co/amazoncom
[19:59] <Torikun> amazon is down =(
[19:59] <darthrobot> Title: [Amazon.com Site Down Reports]
[20:00] <pleia2> prolly using ec2
[20:00] <Torikun> lol
[20:01] <pleia2> YokoZar: you're on the CC, the membership board folks should be replying to that email
[20:01] <pleia2> (I'm sure they already have)
[20:01] <YokoZar> pleia2: It was sent to me personally, I have no idea what he's talking about
[20:01] <pleia2> YokoZar: are you sure it didn't come from LP? (I got one too)
[20:02] <pleia2> footer: "using the "Contact this team's admins" link on the Ubuntu Members team page"
[20:02] <YokoZar> Ahh  you're right
[20:02] <YokoZar> I get messages like this a lot though
[20:02] <YokoZar> personally
[20:02] <YokoZar> not launchpad
[20:03] <YokoZar> half are people asking me to send them Wine
[20:03] <pleia2> I see them come through fairly often through launchpad, I get some personally too , people are funny :)
[20:03] <YokoZar> The other half something blog related
[20:03] <pleia2> it's sweet that they want to contribute, but there are about 40 million documented ways to start, so if you can't even figure that out... :(
[20:04] <YokoZar> I think many of them are low-english IT students in places like India who heard they need to do something Ubuntu related, stumbled upon the website, and then ask me to send them it
[20:04] <pleia2> yeah
[20:14] <nhaines> YokoZar: i needz wine plz if u culd send me cuz i hate windowz but i need it anywa but cant pay so plz send me thx
[20:23] <pleia2> YokoZar: I need wine please, it's been a rough week :)
[21:30] <YokoZar> Does the universe explode if you deluser root?
[21:31] <pleia2> there's only one way to find out!
[22:55] <nhaines> Someone just linked to this on reddit.  I had it posted on my cubicle wall at one point: http://xkcd.com/963/
[22:55] <darthrobot> Title: [xkcd: X11]
[23:09] <gmulak> Am I in the correct place for Southern Calif loco team?  Especially related to SCaLE?
[23:10] <nhaines> gmulak: yes, except the team is statewide.  Welcome.
[23:12] <gmulak> nhaines:  Nathan?
[23:13] <nhaines> gmulak: yes.
[23:13] <nhaines> By convention, anyway.  ;)
[23:13] <gmulak> It's George Mulak from the Lake Forest Ubuntu hour.  Sure have missed all the people there
[23:14] <nhaines> Of course.  :)  Glad you made your way here via IRC!
[23:17] <gmulak> nhaines:  Mostly because of your contribution of help at the Ubuntu hour.  You were so patient with everyone.  A great example of colaboration
[23:18] <nhaines> gmulak: it was a great way to meet up with others and discuss whatever interesting problems they'd come across.  I should get over to Panera again soon.
[23:18] <gmulak> nhaines:  should I also join #scal and #scale-chat since I am going to be there?
[23:19] <gmulak> nhaines:  Now that I have changed jobs I could go again.  I would apreciate it.
[23:19] <gmulak> nahines:  Panera was very kind to us, let us stay awhile and the food was great also.
[23:27] <nhaines> gmulak: since about half of everyone bought *something*, I don't think they were too put out.  Lots of people use it for book clubs and study groups and so on.  :)
[23:28] <nhaines> gmulak: #scale-chat is another IRC network, and it's really more for planning.  Also it's pretty quiet.
[23:29] <gmulak> nhaines:  Yup, Panera was like a coffee shop atmosphere with great food.  I better log onto #scale-chat then, cause I will be at the Ubuntu booth....
[23:31] <nhaines> I should sign up to be at the Ubuntu booth.  Looks like I'll be able to make it after all.
[23:32] <gmulak> nahaines:  Great news - see you there.
[23:33] <nhaines> gmulak: great.  :)
[23:36] <gmulak> what does this mean?  I am the only one in the chat room.  (3:33:52 PM) mode (+ns ) by hitchcock.freenode.net  Not active?
[23:40] <gmulak> This is in the #scale-chat room.....
[23:40] <nhaines> gmulak: it means that you're not on the right network.  SCALE hosts their rooms at irc.oftc.net.
[23:40] <nhaines> What IRC client are you using?
[23:41] <gmulak> nhains:  Pidgin
[23:42] <gmulak> nhaines:  they are not on irc.freenode.net?
[23:43] <nhaines> gmulak: nope.
[23:44] <gmulak> nhaines:  OK, thanks.
[23:44] <nhaines> I strongly recommend the console application irssi.  But use pidgin if it's more convenient.  :)
[23:44] <Torikun> znc!
[23:44] <philipballew> oh, nhaines haven't seen your name in here for a while
[23:45] <philipballew> Quassel is nice...
[23:45] <nhaines> philipballew: this server's been up for 343 days.  :)
[23:45] <nhaines> note to self: I should probably reboot the server.
[23:46] <philipballew> nhaines, I see your putting this server to good use finally :)
[23:46]  * philipballew runs and hides
[23:46] <gmulak> nhaines:  OK, thanks.  I am using it at work on my windoz machine.  I was using it because it was cross-platform.
[23:47] <gmulak> philipballew:  Hello-it's George Mulak
[23:47] <nhaines> gmulak: That's a good reason!  I actually just have a couple VPSes and ssh into my screen session.
[23:47] <philipballew> oh hey gmulak
[23:47] <philipballew> hope all is well
[23:48] <gmulak> nhaines:  OK, what is VPSes?  I know ssh is secure shell...
[23:49] <gmulak> phillipballew:  Yep.  I just ordered my new orange Ubuntu cap for the booth... :-)
[23:49] <nhaines> gmulak: it's a virtual private server.  Instead of buying a computer and paying rent, I just pay for a VM in someone else's colocated server.  :)
[23:50] <gmulak> nhaines:  Oh yes, I remember you showing me that.  One of the things that made me consider chat...
[23:50] <nhaines> In fact, I went with prgmr.com who were at SCALE like two years ago.  I am just checking out chunkhost.com as well.
[23:50] <philipballew> gmulak, oh wow. Im gonna wear some shirts I have from uds, and ill bring some other shirts from to
[23:51] <nhaines> gmulak: you're welcome to have a shell account on one of my servers for a bit to try it out.
[23:51] <gmulak> phillipballew:  I didn't have enough money to order CD's  Only working part time.
[23:52] <philipballew> gmulak, Were gonna get official cd's in the mail to hand out so it should be good
[23:52] <philipballew> I have like 50 official cd's Ill bring as well
[23:52] <gmulak> nhaines:  Wow, that is your usual kindness for sure.  Perhaps at Panera again, you can show me how sometime?
[23:52] <philipballew> and someone might brink some blank ones to burn in case
[23:52] <nhaines> I'll bring my remaining DVDs (they're not CDs anymore) with me as well.
[23:53] <gmulak> phillipballew:  OK, thanks.  Can I buy a XXLarge shirt off of you?
[23:54] <nhaines> gmulak: all you have to do is shoot me an email.  I'll send you a username and password that you can change when you first log in and then you run 'byobu', then 'irssi', and then you can just type '/connect Ubuntu' and then '/join #ubuntu-us-ca'
[23:54] <philipballew> gmulak, I do not think I have any xx. Olny mediums. The Juju talk might have some shirts you can snag
[23:55] <gmulak> phillipballew:  Yes, I was going to bring some CD's and my HDD with distro's on it.  Although I can't find lubuntu distro
[23:55] <gmulak> nhaines:  gmulak - at - hotmail dot com
[23:56] <philipballew> gmulak, just come and answer questions in a professional manner and that should be just fine. :) No need to do more.
[23:57] <gmulak> phillipballew:  Can only afford a few labels however
[23:57] <gmulak> phillipballew:  Just don't kick me out if I don't know enough answers!  :-)  Please!
[23:58] <philipballew> gmulak, I can go over some basic questions you'll get on Friday, or anything you do not want to answer just send them to me.
[23:59] <gmulak> phillipballew:  Great, thanks.  Sometimes the best way to learn is to dive in.  I would like enough knowledge to start an ubuntu hr like nhaines showed me.
