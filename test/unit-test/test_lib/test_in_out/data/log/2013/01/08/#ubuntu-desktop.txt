[07:24] <didrocks> good morning
[07:25] <pitti> bonjour didrocks, ça va? il est tard pour tu, tu ne peux pas dormier?
[07:32] <didrocks> pitti: je suis resté réveillé de 4h à 7h du matin sans dormir :/
[07:32] <didrocks> pitti: j'ai seulement pou dormir de 7h à 8h15 :/
[07:32] <didrocks> pu*
[07:32] <didrocks> d'où le fait que je commence plus tard que d'habitude
[07:32] <didrocks> et sinon, toi, comment vas-tu?
[07:32] <pitti> urgh
[07:34] <pitti> didrocks: je suis encore un peu fatigue, je dois apprendre à me lever tôt à nouveau :)
[07:34] <pitti> mais je vais bien
[07:37] <didrocks> pitti: héhé, ça va revenir :)
[07:42] <jibel> good morning
[08:06] <didrocks> salut jibel, ça va?
[08:06] <jibel> salut didrocks , ça va et toi ?
[08:07] <didrocks> ça va bien, même si un peu sommeil :)
[08:09] <jibel> didrocks, I'll spend some time on debugging the boot issue on the intel box today and get at least 1 run of autopilot on latest raring desktop image
[08:10] <didrocks> jibel: that would be awesome, any idea why nvidia and ati fails as well?
[08:10] <jibel> didrocks, yeah, bug 1097151
[08:10] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1097151 in UTAH "UTAH failed to provision old images" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1097151
[08:11] <didrocks> ah ok, so no more choice, have to go with latest :)
[08:11] <jibel> indeed
[08:11] <didrocks> jibel: can we disable the intel job meanwhile and run the others with the latest image?
[08:11] <didrocks> so that I can run the check without introducing issues for you?
[08:11] <jibel> didrocks, yes, that's the plan
[08:12] <didrocks> great, keep me posted, I will try to have a run of indicators and unity full today :)
[08:12] <didrocks> to know where we are at
[08:16] <jibel> didrocks, it ran yesterday on unity with latest image, intel has been canceled, 44 failures on ati and 45 on nvidia
[08:16] <jibel> didrocks, do you want a new run with today's build?
[08:16] <didrocks> jibel: I would like indicator with full ppa first (so without rebuild)
[08:16] <didrocks> jibel: and the run on unity alone was before appmenu was rebuilt with bamf3 I guess
[08:17] <didrocks> so after that one, yeah, an unity one would be nice as well :)
[08:17] <jibel> didrocks, ok, starting indicators without intel
[08:17] <didrocks> "with whole ppa" (and one sugar) please! :)
[08:24] <seb128> hey desktopers
[08:26] <didrocks> salut seb128! ça va?
[08:26] <seb128> didrocks, lut, ouais, et toi ?
[08:26] <didrocks> ça va bien, peu dormi, donc beaucoup de café! :-)
[08:28] <seb128> didrocks, you always have the option to oversleep in the morning you know? ;-)
[08:29] <didrocks> seb128: I did a little bit, succeed to sleep from 7h to 8h15. I call that an achievement :)
[08:30] <seb128> didrocks, hehe, next one is won by sleeping until 9h ;-)
[08:30] <didrocks> that's a high bar! :-)
[08:38] <didrocks> seb128: team meeting reminder btw!
[08:39] <seb128> didrocks, oh right, thanks, I'm not sure I would have though about it today ... ;-)
[08:39] <seb128> didrocks, I woke up before 9am, it's an achievement in the other direction for me :p
[08:40] <didrocks> seb128: seems it has side-effects though :p
[08:40] <seb128> yeah, I'm already tired :p
[08:41] <didrocks> heh
[08:41] <didrocks> coffee!
[08:51] <didrocks> jibel: are the machines used for something else? http://10.97.0.1:8080/job/ps-indicators-autopilot-release-testing/40/
[08:53] <jibel> didrocks, ps-unity-autopilot-raring is scheduled to run every 2 hours
[08:54] <didrocks> still? I thought we asked to disable it :/
[08:54] <didrocks> as with daily-build, this is not useful at all and we'll remove the staging ppa
[08:54] <jibel> I confirm mmrazik disabled it, I dont know who reactivated this job
[08:57] <didrocks> so I guess we have to wait for this to finish as we can't end up the UTAH side?
[09:51] <chrisccoulson> good morning everyone
[09:55] <didrocks> hey chrisccoulson
[09:55] <chrisccoulson> hi didrocks, how are you?
[09:56] <seb128> chrisccoulson, howdy
[09:56] <chrisccoulson> hi seb128, how are you?
[09:56] <didrocks> chrisccoulson: I'm good, thanks, yourself?
[09:57] <chrisccoulson> didrocks, yeah, not too bad thanks. but quite tired
[09:57] <seb128> chrisccoulson, good, thanks ;-)
[09:57] <chrisccoulson> had a fairly late night
[09:57] <seb128> late hacking?
[09:57] <seb128> resuming the old habits? :p
[09:57] <chrisccoulson> seb128, firefox release week ;)
[09:57] <chrisccoulson> (getting the next set of beta's ready)
[09:57] <seb128> oh, right
[09:57] <seb128> well at least it was not during the decembre holidays this time!
[09:58] <chrisccoulson> yeah, i'm glad about that :)
[10:12] <chrisccoulson> all the red is making me very sad: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mozilla-daily/+archive/ppa/+packages
[10:18] <seb128> chrisccoulson, how come you are still doing natty builds?
[10:18] <chrisccoulson> seb128, i'm not. i just haven't cleaned it out
[10:18] <seb128> oh ok
[10:19] <chrisccoulson> i'm not even doing lucid or oneiric builds now either ;)
[10:20] <seb128> chrisccoulson, hum, what is it failing on?  the build logs are not really clear on what the error is
[10:21] <chrisccoulson> seb128, it's failing on a build system test
[10:22] <seb128> well, at least with daily builds you have a good idea of when issues start
[10:22] <chrisccoulson> yeah, that's a good thing :)

[10:53] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1091702 in upower (Ubuntu) "upower fails to recognize hid devices with new kernels" [Low,Fix released]
=== Ivanka_ is now known as Ivanka
[11:00] <pitti> seb128: if someone asks for it and wants to test it, yes; it might be applicable to precise eventually; but I wouldn't worry about quantal TBH
=== tkamppeter__ is now known as tkamppeter
[11:01] <seb128> pitti, right, the question was rather about the LTS, I'm not sure if that's going to bite through kernel backports for hdw enablement
[11:02] <seb128> pitti, I'm adding a low priority precise target to the bug if that works for you
[11:03] <pitti> sure, I'll upload the SRU
[11:03] <pitti> question is mainly how to test it
[11:03] <pitti> or "who"
[11:04] <pitti> really testing it would require an UPS
[11:06] <seb128> pitti, maybe the submitter can test ... well the other option is to wait for the kernel to be updated and somebody to report the issue but that means having a regression first to deal with it then
[11:06] <pitti> it can be regression tested on the old kernel
[11:07] <seb128> right

[13:59] <larsu> google translate seems to be really bad at Esperanto
[13:59] <larsu> s/at Esperanto//
[14:00] <desrt> no.  it did well.
[14:00] <desrt> bonan is casual
[14:00] <larsu> anyway: good day to you too :)
[14:00] <seb128> desrt, hey, happy new year !
[14:00] <desrt> seb128: good to see you're finally back to work :)
[14:00] <larsu> haha
[14:00] <seb128> good to be back ;-)
[14:02]  * desrt had a nice 'relaxing' holiday
[14:04] <seb128> desrt, does the 'relaxing' includes some hacking? :p
[14:04] <desrt> no
[14:04] <desrt> it was a very very busy vacation
[14:04] <seb128> great ;-)
[14:04] <desrt> the usual christmas stuff with my family
[14:05] <desrt> poland with tiffany's family was insanely busy -- not a single day free
[14:05] <desrt> plus all of the work associated with getting the house ready for sale.  it's finally up on the market now.
[14:06] <seb128> sounds like a whole lot of non-computer-busy, which is good ;-)
[14:07] <desrt> ya maybe
[14:07] <desrt> except i had a lot that i wanted to get done :p
[14:08] <larsu> GSettingsList?
[14:08] <seb128> lol
[14:08]  * larsu should probably shut up
[14:08] <seb128> there we go :p
[14:08] <desrt> larsu: hey.  how's the GActionMuxer reimplementation going?
[14:08] <larsu> ya
[14:08] <desrt> or action descriptions for Gtk?
[14:09] <desrt> seb128: did you hear the news?  i finally convinced someone to move to toronto :)
[14:09] <larsu> actionmuxer would have been my over-the-holidays project. I was distracted, though
[14:09] <seb128> desrt, yeah, larsu told me this morning
[14:09] <desrt> larsu: fair enough :)
[14:09] <seb128> desrt, like jasoncwarner moving to Canada was not enough!
[14:09] <desrt> he moved to the wrong side
[14:09] <desrt> don't get me wrong.... BC is a fine place
[14:10] <desrt> but there's all sorts of not so fine places between here and there that make me not want to go there
[14:10] <desrt> like robru's old neighbourhood...
[14:10] <larsu> flyover country?
[14:10] <desrt> canadian equivalent, ya
[14:10] <larsu> isn't that what you call it?
[14:10] <desrt> it's more of an american term
[14:10] <larsu> makes more sense there I guess
[14:10] <desrt> it doesn't work quite as well in canada
[14:11] <seb128> desrt, I can see that, the right side is the french speaking one, right? ;-)
[14:11] <desrt> since our 'interesting' areas are not the coasts
=== MacSlow|lunch is now known as MacSlow
[14:11] <larsu> you have more than one interesting area?
[14:12]  * didrocks agrees on the relationship between the right side and french speaking
[14:12] <desrt> the toronto/ottawa/montreal (extend to windor and quebec city if you like) is the equivalent of america's boswash
[14:13] <desrt> vancouver/victoria is like LA/SF
[14:14] <desrt> but canada has a lot of 'flyover' that's on the east coast as well -- the only difference is that you fly over it on the way to europe
[14:14] <desrt> which is sort of a shame -- it's really lovely out there
[14:15] <larsu> lovely as in nature?
[14:15] <desrt> ya
[14:15] <desrt> the economy is not so lovely
[14:16] <desrt> to this day it's still very heavily dependent on fishing... and that hasn't gone very well for a long time

[16:37] <seb128> didrocks, hey
[16:37] <didrocks> hey hey
[16:37] <didrocks> Still working on having daily release of unity, some indicators tests to ensure the non regression are failing. Sending some bug hunter to it :)
[16:37] <didrocks> Also, testing latest trunk showed some regressions (including non building trunk), they are mostly fixed now.

[16:37] <kenvandine> Merged GwibberGtkEntry and related widgets into friends as FriendsGtkEntry
[16:37] <kenvandine> Lots of API updates for libfriends, finalizing API before landing in raring
[16:37] <kenvandine> Adding dbusmock tests to libfriends to mock out the friends dbus interfaces (/me hugs pitti)

[16:39] <seb128> cyphermox, hey
[16:39] <cyphermox> hey!
[16:39] <cyphermox> Still fighting indicator tests failing in PPAs -- indicator-session being my current focus. Uploaded a new NM with bridge support yesterday.
[16:40] <mlankhorst> hey
[16:40] <cyphermox> that's the jist of it; didrocks mentioned the rest -- mterry is helping to look at libappindicator and dbusmenu
[16:40] <cyphermox> ..
[16:40] <mlankhorst> sorry was fighting pixman, not much to report, trying to get reverse optimus working, getting dependencies for x1.14 server done
[16:41] <seb128> cyphermox, will you get to all the network specs? looking at the workitems list you have quite some of those in addition of the indicator stack to handle
[16:41] <seb128> mlankhorst, thanks
[16:41] <cyphermox> seb128: yeah. if the tests for indicators would work the rest would already be done
[16:41] <cyphermox> I'll take some time off the indicators if possible to just get through the network work items, I don't expect this to take much more than a week
[16:42] <mlankhorst> prime synchronization seems stable, kernel parts at least, but i want to test a bit more and not sure how to upstream it yet :)
[16:42] <seb128> cyphermox, thanks
[16:42] <seb128> mterry, hey
[16:42] <mterry> I've been working with my pandaboard a bit, using it for daily tasks.  Did a lot of investigation into a duplicity data corruption bug.  And a unity-greeter release.  Now am going to be helping with getting unity and friends' autopilot tests working.  EOF

[16:44] <seb128> sorry got sidetracked
[16:44] <seb128> no robru?
[16:44] <seb128> tkamppeter, hey
[16:44] <tkamppeter> I have done the following:
[16:44] <tkamppeter> Created cups-browsed, a daemon which browses the Bonjour broadcasts of shareed CUPS printers on remote machines and creating local CUPS queues pointing to these printers, replacing the former CUPS broadcasting/browsing. So remote CUPS printers are simply available again, without individual configuration. Part of cups-filters 1.0.28, packaged for Raring.
[16:45] <tkamppeter> CUPS: Dropped forward-port patch of CUPS broadcastingf/browsing in Raring, not needed any more due to cups-browsed.
[16:45] <tkamppeter> CUPS: Split CUPS daemon off into an extra binary package, so for mobile systems one can use a 1-MB printing stack of cups-daemon, libcups2, and cups-browsed, to only get remote CUPS printers automatically and print on them, all the rest of the printing stack is for local printers with drivers.
[16:46] <tkamppeter> I have also prepared an SRU for Q, suppressing the Apport pop-ups of a harmless cupsd crash on logrotate caused by the forward port of CUPS browsing.
[16:47] <seb128> tkamppeter, thanks
[16:48] <seb128> attente, hey
[16:48] <attente> seb128, hi
[16:48] <attente> since last time
[16:48] <attente> fixed a couple of issues with the module when used on empathy-chat, but it's still crashing unfortunately, which is a deal-breaker for testing at least...
[16:48] <attente> changes to indicator-appmenu so that we can avoid merging our action groups with the app's in most cases
[16:48] <attente> split the parser logic into another library, and currently trying to split the module into a separate -dev package for the indicators guys to use
[16:48] <attente> added gtk-doc support, will add more documentation this week
[16:48] <attente> EOF
[16:49] <seb128> attente, thanks
[16:49] <seb128> me: I just came back to work yesterday, so just emails etc catchup and blueprints review
[16:49] <seb128> .
[16:49] <seb128> did I forget anyone? questions/comments?
[16:51] <seb128> seems not
[16:51] <seb128> let's get back to work then, we have quite some to do this year ;-)
[16:51] <kenvandine> :)
[16:51] <seb128> thanks everyone
[16:53] <mterry> yay
[16:56] <attente> seb128: larsu suggested that i start a new project on launchpad for the module
[16:56] <attente> who should be designated as maintainer for it?
[16:57] <seb128> attente, hum, good question, maybe check with didrocks and do the same as for indicators and other stuff #ps is doing
[16:57] <didrocks> who would be the maintainer?
[16:58] <didrocks> normally, we tend to put stuff which are under ps umbrella to pspmteam
[17:02] <attente> also, seb128, have you seen this error before?
[17:02] <attente> dh_install: unity-gtk-module-dev missing files (usr/include/unity-gtk-module/*), aborting
[17:04] <seb128> attente, it seems like you listed stuff in debian/unity....install which are not installed by make install

[18:07]  * didrocks waves good evening and night!
[18:07] <didrocks> and happy new year jbicha :)
[18:10] <jbicha> Laney, seb128: I don't think we should have libgnome-desktop-3-4 depend on gnome-desktop3-data (= ${source:Version}) as it breaks parallel installability with newer versions
[18:10] <jbicha> (such as the version that was uploaded to the GNOME3 staging PPA)
[18:13] <seb128> jbicha, hey, >= rather? it has always been a not-so-well-defined thing
[18:14] <jbicha> yeah, >= should work

[18:44] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1047606 in Ubuntu Raring "[needs-packaging] ubuntuone-client-data" [Wishlist,New]
[18:44] <seb128> dobey, I sure can, let me have a look if I spot any NEW blocker issue
[18:45] <dobey> seb128: thanks much!
[18:46] <seb128> dobey, yw!
[18:49] <seb128> dobey, looks good, just curious ... what do you use inkscape for as a build-depends?
[18:50] <jbicha> seb128: oh you're sponsoring now? :) https://code.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-desktop/vte/ubuntu-vte3
[18:51] <seb128> jbicha, lol, I'm about to leave for dinner but I will queue it for tomorrow of nobody beats me to it
[18:51] <dobey> seb128: it's needed to rebuild the icons. we don't do it in the package build right now, but it's there to keep the nightlies and actual packaging as close as possible. since it's in main i figured it would be fine. i can remove it if you think it's necessary
[18:51] <jbicha> seb128: cool, thanks :)
[18:51] <seb128> jbicha, you should ping cjwatson to get vte added to the desktop set btw
[18:51] <seb128> yw
[18:51] <seb128> dobey, no, that's fine, I was mostly curious
[18:52] <jbicha> vte is, but vte3 wasn't added
[18:53] <seb128> jbicha, it should ;-)
[18:57] <ricotz> jbicha, hi, just upload a gnome-desktop3 3.7.2-0ubuntu1~raring2 to gnome3-team/gnome3 with the relaxed dependency
[19:00] <jbicha> ricotz: thanks, that's a good idea
[19:12] <ricotz> jbicha, ok
[19:14] <jbicha> ricotz: done
[19:21] <ricotz> jbicha, thanks (don't be shy to bump the urgency)
[19:22] <ricotz> will take 6 hours for amd64 :\
[19:23] <jbicha> ricotz: you can do another upload if you want it to build sooner (or ping someone with magic rescoring powers)
[19:30] <ricotz> jbicha, alright

[19:52] <robru> seb128, sorry for missing the meeting.
[19:52] <seb128> robru, hey, no worry, it's just a reboot after holidays, just make sure to be there for the next one ;-)
[19:53] <robru> seb128, haha, ok
[19:56] <soren> Which component handles the display reconfiguration when I plug/unplug a monitor?
[19:57] <seb128> soren, gnome-settings-daemon
[19:58] <soren> seb128: Oh. I thought it was a separate component. Cool, thanks!
[19:58] <seb128> yw!
[20:01] <attente> seb128: sorry, i made a bit of progress, but i'm stuck again...

[20:07] <attente> oy, it must be because it's not running --enable-gtk-doc
[20:07]  * mterry 's hard drive may have died...  :(
[20:07] <soren> mterry: Surely you of all people have a backup. :)
[20:10] <mterry> soren, :)
[20:17] <jbicha> robru: if you sleep in late enough, you could probably do the Australia meeting instead :)
[20:18] <robru> jbicha, yes, I tried that once, and the timing worked quite well for me, but I discovered that he "australian" meeting was almost exclusively for X11 hackers, so I didn't have much to contribute there. :-(
[20:20] <jbicha> well there is TheMuso and robert_ancell but yeah the late meeting usually isn't as exciting ;)
[21:01] <seb128> attente, did you figure it out?
[21:01] <seb128> do you build in a pbuilder? you might lack gtk-doc-tools or something
[21:16] <attente> seb128: yeah, this is within pbuilder
[21:20] <seb128> try adding gtk-doc-tools to the Build-Depends
[21:24] <attente> seb128: that seemed to do the trick
[21:26] <attente> now it's complaining about gtk, but i guess i can figure it out from here, thanks seb128 :)
[21:31] <TheMuso> Does anybody else get an error when attempting to edit https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DesktopTeam/Meeting/2013-01-08?
[21:32] <TheMuso> Hrm its even happening now when accessing the wiki.
[21:36] <attente> configuration error?
[21:36] <TheMuso> Yeah...
[21:51] <TheMuso> Ok all back to normal now it seems.

[22:17] <RAOF> Odd. My pandaboard seems to reliably become unresponsive after 24 hours of uptime.
[22:25] <TheMuso> RAOF: Running precise/ I'll have to try that myself.

[23:03] <chrisccoulson> RAOF, does your pandaboard get hot?
[23:04] <RAOF> chrisccoulson: Warm, certainly. I'm not sure I'd describe it as "hot" though.
[23:05] <TheMuso> Agreed, and really only around he general area of teh SoC.
[23:05] <chrisccoulson> ah, mine gets quite hot, but i've only really been building stuff on it
[23:05] <chrisccoulson> mine feels like it's going to melt through the desk ;)
[23:06] <TheMuso> I guess as long as its ventilated.
[23:08] <Laney> mine irregularly hardlocks, see the gaps in http://home.orangesquash.org.uk/~laney/temp-30day-l.png
[23:08] <TheMuso> I've seen that too, even on precise.
[23:08] <Laney> can't see anything in the logs when it happens really
[23:08] <TheMuso> Usually the board has been doing some USB IO of some kind.
[23:08] <Laney> this is constantly doing USB IO to generate those graphs
[23:08] <TheMuso> You're all using USB disks right?
[23:08] <Laney> and it updates my local mirror (to a USB disk)
[23:09] <TheMuso> Right, so a busy board then.
[23:09] <Laney> yeah
[23:09] <sarnold> mine has excellent ventilation, reads/writes only to an SD card, low ethernet use, and hasn't locked on me yet
[23:10] <TheMuso> I wonder if its anything to do with lots of USB use accross multiple USB devices.
[23:10] <TheMuso> Because ehternet is via USB afaik.
[23:10] <TheMuso> ethernet
