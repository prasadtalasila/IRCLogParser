[13:05] <deepee> Can someone confirm my understanding ? Is it easy to install the latest mythbuntu 12.04 and then upgrade to mythtv 0.26 ? Many Thanks.....
[13:39] <sabhain> deepee, that's my understanding as well .. that you can decide which mythtv to keep current inside MCC.  I'd wait for confirmation from one of the regulars here.
[13:41] <deepee> thx sabhain and wilco ! :-)
[15:32] <Shadow__X> deepee: sabhain once you have mythbuntu installed and setup
[15:32] <Shadow__X> you run mythbuntu control center and are able to select .26 repo
[15:32] <deepee> oh wow !!  Just waiting on the hardware arriving, thanks very much !!
[16:03] <qwebirc44069> I have tried a couple of different tv tuner capture cards and unable to get any of them to work.  Please recommend one which will work out of the box for over the air digital and anologue in North America
[16:08] <Shadow__X> qwebirc44069: did you check the mythtv wiki or the linuxtv wiki
[16:11] <qwebirc44069> yes, the issue I have is i tried a one and it did not work and the rest I cannot seem to buy anymore
[16:11] <qwebirc44069> most of what is listed is for Europe
[16:13] <Shadow__X> what card do you currently have
[16:13] <Shadow__X> and you are trying to only do analog correct?
[16:14] <sabhain> qwebirc44069 do you need them to be the same card?  digital/analog?
[16:15] <qwebirc44069> I am trying to capture over the air digital and analogue via other sources
[16:15] <Shadow__X> what are the other sources
[16:16] <qwebirc44069> It does not have to be on the same card, other sources i.e. cable box
[16:16] <sabhain> for the digital, I'd recommend the HDHomeRun (older style without the cable card).  Setup is dead easy, and it's reliable .. only needs the antenna or cable feed, and a port on the LAN.
[16:17] <Shadow__X> qwebirc44069: you want to record analog and digital from a cable box? if you plan to do that you are either stuck with analog going from the coax out from the box or using something like the hdpvr
[16:17] <sabhain> for analog, I use the hauppage PVR-500  .. it's an internal card with 2 analog tuners.  I set it up many years ago and forgot about it.
[16:32] <qwebirc44069> i am unable to find it available (PVR-500)
[16:34] <qwebirc44069> dumb question how does the HDHomeRun work with mythbuntu?
[16:34] <sabhain> like they were made for each other.
[16:35] <qwebirc44069> bad news discontinued
[16:35] <sabhain> you add the HDHomeRun as any other tuner in the backend setup, link it to a lineup, and scan for channels.  Then you have dual digital tuners for either OTA with an antenna, or any clear QAM channelson your cable signal
[16:37] <qwebirc44069> i liked the idea of this box.  I will have to see if I can find one somewhere.  This is what I keep running into good card/box and it is discontinued :(
[16:38] <tgm4883> qwebirc44069, you'll have difficulty finding an analog tuner in the US that is still in production
[16:38] <tgm4883> I'm not sure they are allowed to sell them anymore
[16:38] <sabhain> qwebirc44069: see this: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16815345007
[16:38] <tgm4883> qwebirc44069, where do you get your TV from?
[16:39] <sabhain> tgm4883 there are a few Hauppage cards at Newegg that still do analog
[16:40] <tgm4883> sabhain, not analog only, and nothing that I can think of off the top of my head that is any good
[16:40] <tgm4883> then again, I don't do analog
[16:40] <sabhain> I'm trying to stop
[16:40] <tgm4883> I'm actually a bit surprised that people still want it
[16:41] <tgm4883> since it's terrible
[16:41] <sabhain> finally got my HD-PVR installated yesterday
[16:41] <qwebirc44069> it looks like there are new models out, hope they willl work
[16:41] <sabhain> tgm4883 some cable companies (TWC) make it really difficult and expensive to be entirely digital in myth
[16:42] <qwebirc44069> need analog for migration
[16:42] <sabhain> I use the analog for the kids' shows
[16:42] <sabhain> qwebirc44069, I think the HDHomerun is as close to bulletproof in setup as you're going to find for unencrypted digital.
[16:42] <tgm4883> sabhain, yea TWC does suck
[16:43] <tgm4883> qwebirc44069, who is your cable provider?
[16:44] <sabhain> tgm4883, about a year after I set my system up, we got swapped from adelphia (just about everything available via clear QAM) to TWC (minimal).
[16:45] <qwebirc44069> i like the idea of the HDHomeRun as well I will give it a try.  I like the idea it could be used by other computers as well
[16:45] <tgm4883> sabhain, do you know if cable cards work well?
[16:45] <tgm4883> or did they just protect everything too
[16:46] <sabhain> everything is set to copy once, so I think the cable card is a non-starter
[16:49] <Shadow__X> tgm4883: not that long ago i got my hd home run prime and am super happy i did
[16:49] <Shadow__X> firewire was not as stable as it once was
[16:49] <tgm4883> HDHRPrime FTW
[16:49] <Shadow__X> its fantastic honestly
[16:50] <Shadow__X> if comcast doesnt screw with my cablecard provision recording 3d content works too
[16:50] <qwebirc44069> i'm sold  I will give it a try
[16:50] <Shadow__X> qwebirc44069: i would not try to record off of a cable box using analog
[16:50] <Shadow__X> unless its the hdpvr
[16:51] <Shadow__X> the quality of analog is bad
[16:51] <qwebirc44069> the only concern i have is is if 100meg is enough for HD
[16:51] <Shadow__X> for the frontneds?
[16:51] <Shadow__X> ends
[16:51] <qwebirc44069> for the HDHomeRun to the backend
[16:52] <Shadow__X> which one
[16:52] <Shadow__X> hdhomerun or hd homerun prime?
[16:52] <Shadow__X> prime does cablecard which imo might be a better option depending on your cable provider
[16:53] <qwebirc44069> Prime
[16:53] <Shadow__X> comcast for example has all channels except premiums accessible via the prime in mythtv
[16:53] <Shadow__X> its gigabit
[16:53] <qwebirc44069> cable provider does not support card; looking for over the air and anlog
[16:54] <Shadow__X> what cable provider do you have that doesnt support cablecard
[16:55] <sabhain> isnt that the law"
[16:55] <sabhain> ?
[16:55] <Shadow__X> there is a fcc mandate but i am wondering if qwebirc44069 has a small cable company that the mandate might not apply to
[16:59] <qwebirc44069> does not apply unfortunately
[17:00] <Shadow__X> who is your cable provider?
[17:05] <Shadow__X> ah the ip is from canada
[18:12]  * sabhain wishes I had comcast as an option .. it would severely simplify my backend setup.
[18:12] <sabhain> tgm4883, I shouldn't be worried about support for the older analog cards in current 12.04, right?
[18:13] <tgm4883> sabhain, I don't think that has been removed. I've seen stuff on the mailing list about issues with the older PVR150/500 cards on mythtv 0.26 though
[18:14] <sabhain> that'd be the card I'm using (PVR500)
[18:14] <sabhain> so maybe I've got to stay with 0.25?
[18:15] <tgm4883> 12.04 ships with 0.25
[18:15] <tgm4883> I'm unsure the issues with it on 0.26, I've not read that thread as I don't use those cards
[18:15] <sabhain> there seem to be more and more reasons to not upgrade (grub2, diskless .. ugh).
[18:15] <tgm4883> whats wrong with grub 2?
[18:16] <sabhain> before I used mythbuntu-diskless for my front ends .. I did an NFS boot where I had a 2GB CF card with /boot, and then / was on an NFS share on my backend.
[18:16] <tgm4883> http://www.mentby.com/Group/mythtv-users/state-of-the-pvr150250-in-026.html
[18:20] <sabhain> NFS boot appears to be broken in grub2.
[18:21] <sabhain> so I installed old grub .. but wasn't able to get back to what worked, so I punted and put in an SSD
[18:36] <sabhain> mostly I think I've forgotten the little tweaks I learned on getting it stable.  I can get the base system up and running with / on NFS, but once I do the install of the frontend and it rewrites intramfs .. things go south.
[18:37] <sabhain> .. which is why I'd prefer to help get diskless back .. it's a much more elegant and maintainable solution

[21:49] <whyzzyrd> sabhain, looks like I ought to be able to do it with the fat-client options, and a script to populate the mythtv settings into the overlay.
