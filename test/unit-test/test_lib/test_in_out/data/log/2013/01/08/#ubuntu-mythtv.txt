[02:02] <qwebirc18997> I'm running mythbuntu 10.04 sound was working, now no audio when playing back a recording, VLC audio works fine.  The box is in production, currently recording "The Bachelor"!, so non-evasive configuration is wanted...thanks.
[02:02] <tgm4883> qwebirc18997, do you have pulseaudio installed?
[02:09] <qwebirc18997> I did.
[02:11] <qwebirc18997> I have a nvidia GT2XX video card using HDMI audio.  VLC audio works.
[02:11] <tgm4883> qwebirc18997, what changed between when it didn't work and when it does?
[02:12] <qwebirc18997> Unfortunately I'm not sure, I had to replace my router and gigabit switch, so I had to reconfigure the backend IP address, other than that I'm not sure how the audio config got botched up.
[02:13] <qwebirc18997> No audio out using Chrome flash youtube videos either...
[02:14] <tgm4883> qwebirc18997, my guess is, that since it works outside of mythtv (in vlc) that all you need to do is go to the mythtv frontend audio config and select the right output
[02:18] <qwebirc39183> I've tried just about every combination in the frontend setup...still no luck.
[02:21] <qwebirc39183> How would I got about getting Pulse audio reconfigured?
[02:21] <tgm4883> qwebirc39183, I don't think mythtv works with pulseaudio
[02:21] <tgm4883> pretty sure not in 10.04
[02:21] <qwebirc39183> k.
[02:23] <qwebirc39183> I installed alsamixergui it throws an error when I tried to run it.
[02:25] <tgm4883> what error?
[02:26] <qwebirc39183> alsamixer function snd_mixer_load failed invalid argument
[02:29] <tgm4883> qwebirc39183, weird, can you load alsamixer from the cmd line?
[02:31] <qwebirc96084> command line doesn't work either.

[16:22] <qwebirc26902> Just upgraded a couple of my boxes to 12.10 and have a couple questions / statements
[16:23] <qwebirc26902> I've upgraded on of these boxes from 11.04....I did the lightdm switch at 11.10....gdm was still left behind and upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 brought back pulseaudio....I tracked it down to gdm still being installed but not in use
[16:24] <qwebirc26902> I removed gdm and pulseaudio any everything is back to normal....just wondering if there's a way to prevent this
[16:26] <qwebirc26902> My second comment is mythweb is broken going from 12.04 to 12.10...I needed to remove the & on line 50 of /usr/share/mythtv/bindings/php/MythBase.php and restart apache2....is this a mythbuntu bug or a myth bug?
[16:33] <qwebirc26902> Oh....I'm on myth 0.25 for all of this
