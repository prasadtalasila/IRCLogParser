[09:14] <dpm> hi danilos, good morning. If you're around, would you mind looking at this merge proposal I sent for intltool yesterday? https://code.launchpad.net/~dpm/intltool/add-qtdesigner-support/+merge/145112
[09:32] <danilos> dpm, hi, overall it looks good: can you ping me towards the end of the day please (so I can focus a bit more on the regexes)?
[10:02] <dpm> danilos, sure, thanks
[16:03] <dpm> danilos, here's the "ping me towards the end of the day" ping, if you've got a minute to review the regexes on the intltool MP: https://code.launchpad.net/~dpm/intltool/add-qtdesigner-support/+merge/145112 :-)
