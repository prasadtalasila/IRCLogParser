[00:02] <gabriel_> o
[00:02] <gabriel_> ok

[00:04] <mhall119> gabriel_: is this one of the qt/qml templates?
[00:04] <gabriel_> noooo
[00:04] <gabriel_>  HTML app: quickly create ubuntu-html-app
[00:04] <gabriel_> I took the HTML template
[00:05] <mhall119> oh, I think this is a known bug, aquarius hit it too if memory serves
[00:06] <mhall119> the html template inherits from the python/gtk ubuntu-applicaiton template, and it didn't fully re-implement everything it needs to
[00:07] <gabriel_> I didn't have any problems to make the debian package
[00:07] <gabriel_> the problem is in quickly share
[00:09] <bobweaver> mhall119,  does it use dch -i on every quickly share ?
[00:09] <mhall119> I think so
[00:10] <mhall119> it probably only runs the license check when you go to share it too
[00:10] <mhall119> so quickly build wouldn't have called the code that is failing
[00:11] <mhall119> if it's the bug aq found a while ago, it's using the python/gtk license command, which expects to find python files
[00:16] <bobweaver> ahh I see
[05:29] <fourboobs> Hi, quick question, is it possible to develop for ububtu for phones in python at the moment?

[12:02] <midnight_> k, ive installed ubuntu on my samsung note, i hope that i can install on it :P
[13:15] <bobweaver> Question:  I am starting to make a app that is for american football coach's . It lets them make plays have a playbook edit scheama's for teams ect. Do you think that this is a good idea or a waste of time ?
[13:16] <auronandace> bobweaver: perhaps you could ask coaches
[13:17] <bobweaver> auronandace,  that is a good idea .
[13:17] <smartboyhw> bobweaver, well the problem is that whether American Football coaches uses them at the first place.
[13:17] <smartboyhw> Better promote it first
[13:18] <bobweaver> auronandace,  it is just I stared working on it last night, and today I looked at it more in a light of how long would this take to make real nice and I Think that it would take me at least 2 to 4 months
[13:18] <smartboyhw> "them" = Ubuntu phones:P
[13:19] <smartboyhw> bobweaver, have a private chat?
[13:20] <bobweaver> maybe I should tie something else in it to make it more then just american football or add things to make for more then just coach's but then there is the hells bells of NFL copyright
[13:20] <bobweaver> sure smartboyhw
[13:20] <bobweaver> thanks for asking :)

[18:36] <ckpringle> I'm a UX designer at Canonical, and it's cool! I showed the guys here, we had some quick design questions / ideas if you're interested
[18:40] <GuidoPallemans> yeah sure

[19:28] <user82_> anything happeed after CES or silence for a while until we get source/images?
[19:28] <user82_> producer deals...announcements?
[19:32] <dangersalad> user82_: I think we will see a flurry when the images are released. I hope I can get it on my SGSII quickly....
[19:33] <user82_> well i want to buy a new phone..but i wait for the first results
[19:33] <user82_> i think so too dangersalad
[19:33] <AndroUser2> Will the gnex be a dual boot for the os
[19:36] <dangersalad> AndroUser2: meaning will it have the desktop when docked? Or dual booting android?
[19:37] <AndroUser2> Dual booting android/Ubuntu or complete wipe and ubuntu only
[19:38] <k1l> AndroUser2: i think most common is a native single bootup on a phone
[19:38] <dangersalad> AndroUser2: IIRC you will only be able to have one OS on at a time
[19:39] <dangersalad> That being said, I am sure someone over at XDA will figure out a way at some point
[19:39] <k1l> but i dont know what its gonna be. but the nexus devices dont have that much internal space and no sd-card. so i think single botup is the way to go
[19:40] <AndroUser2> That is what i was thinking it would be. About time to dust off my gnex from my nexus 4
[19:44] <AndroUser2> Do we have any idea what install memory usage is going to be like?
[19:46] <disharmonic> afaik they haven't even implemented all of the features yet
[19:48] <AndroUser2> I know everything hasn't been implemented but was there an estimate?
[19:53] <disharmonic> AndroUser2, i haven't seen anything like that. At this point we don't even know the minimum requirements. From the OEM guidelines i would assume 512MB should be OK
[19:53] <disharmonic> ah too late
[19:55] <user82_> disharmonic 512mb of what? os flash memory or ram
[19:57] <disharmonic> ram
[19:58] <disharmonic> user82_, ram
[19:58] <user82_> ah ok...
[19:58] <user82_> my phone now has 173mb of ram with android 2.2. times changed but 512 should be totally sufficient
[19:58] <disharmonic> you mean free ram>
[19:58] <disharmonic> ?
[20:01] <disharmonic> All  new midrange phones should have at least 1GB actually. Most high end phones have more. In 2014, which is  the target year for devices shipping with Ubuntu, i suspect even low end phones will have 1GB
[20:01] <user82_> disharmonic i mean ram
[20:01] <user82_> and i have around 4mb free too...i rooted my phone and removed all running crap
[20:02] <user82_> calendard. whatsapp. email. system+launcher. that is all running
[20:02] <disharmonic> On the other hand i feel the 4GB minimum eMMC requirement is a bit on the high side
[20:02] <disharmonic> user82_, you're phone must be at least 3-4 years old
[20:03] <user82_> disharmonic it is around 1 year but a 115$ china thing...
[20:03] <user82_> it has 256mb of ram but the gpu is a software renderer eating the rest i think
[20:03] <user82_> so android has 173mb
[20:03] <user82_> slow as hell....but now i am waiting for ubuntu phone
[20:04] <disharmonic> That's gonna take a while
[20:04] <user82_> yep..but it still works. maybe i will use another phone+image
[20:04] <user82_> if it takes too long
[20:04] <user82_> (2014)
[20:07] <disharmonic> I've been looking at  Galaxy Nexus prices, but imo it's too expensive for what it offers atm. The nexus 4 is a much better deal
[20:09] <k1l> nexus4 is a better deal, if you can manage  to buy one :)
[20:09] <user82_> i will buy a used phone of the last gen (1ghz single core and 512 ram) or a gnex
[20:09] <user82_> k1l true..sold out
[20:10] <k1l> 1core and 512mb is to less
[20:10] <k1l> i would recommend everyone (no matter if ubuntu-phone or not) to go for a dualcore and 1gb ram at least
[20:14] <disharmonic> You should be able to find a phone with 1GB of ram. Most 2012 midrange phones have 1GB and more than 1GHz single core
[20:21] <disharmonic> e.g. iirc this goes for ~$250 unlocked https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S_III_Mini
[22:43] <dmdrummond> Has anyone heard what the graphics stack is?  X, Wayland or the Android stack?
[22:44]  * cielak hopes it's wayland
