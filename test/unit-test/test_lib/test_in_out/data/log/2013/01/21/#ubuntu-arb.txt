[13:31] <dpm> hi coolbhavi
[13:33] <coolbhavi> dpm, I was thinking to clear the arb queue for now and had sent a mail but I dint get any response :(
[13:35] <coolbhavi> just went through the queue now. and some of them are real good apps btw
[13:36] <dpm> coolbhavi, I know. Did you try pinging someone else from the ARB on the channel to see what they think?
[13:37] <coolbhavi> yes highvoltage was speaking about the same
[13:38] <coolbhavi> I'll ping on list again anyway
