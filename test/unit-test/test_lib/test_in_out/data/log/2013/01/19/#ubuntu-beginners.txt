[10:12] <Patyh> Hi..
[15:55] <yeehi> How can I do all these 3 things, installing Quantal: Manually decide the partitions and file systems, (easy) and encrypt (easy) and also have LVM? (doing the last thing too is difficult for me.)
[19:29] <realm174_> Installing Ubuntu on a new computer. Need to migrate everything from the old computer. Different versions: Old computer 11.04 32 bit, new computer 12.10 64 bit. Any step by step?
[19:30] <geirha> Depends what "everything" means
[19:31] <realm174_> Ah yes... well, old ubuntu has web/ftp servers running. Also would like to migrate shared folders (/home, /share). I can figure out how to copy the files, but how about the server settings? Can I just copy the files from /etc and restart apache?
[19:32] <geirha> most likely, yes.
[19:33] <geirha> you may need to tweak some config files to account for the version gap, but in general, software is backward compatible
[19:34] <realm174_> oh good! I guess same goes with the /etc/samba folder then...
[19:35] <realm174_> Last question... What's the easiest way to find out what else I might have installed over the years on the old computer that is "still in use"?
[19:35] <geirha> take care though, don't copy all config files at once, do one service at a time, do some simple tests to ensure its up
[19:35] <geirha> if the old config fails to work on the new system, there's always dpkg-reconfigure or apt-get purge to start over
[19:36] <geirha> that's a tough one
[19:38] <geirha> you can run a command to get a list of packages currently installed. That'll give you a clue, but doesn't really tell you if they're in use or not
[19:38] <realm174_> Well, I'll start with the ones I already know, I guess I'll find out if there's something missing as I go along :)  thanks for the assistance, that was very helpful!!
[19:57] <realm174_> alright, problem #1... I used wubi to install Ubuntu along with Win7. Wubi only grabbed 16G out of the 250Gb of freespace I had. Is there a way to allocate more to Ubuntu or do I need to re-install?
[19:59] <geirha> Yes, the easiest way is just creating a new virtual disk for it.
[20:00] <geirha> I believe the wubi page describes how
[20:01] <geirha> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_create_a_virtual_disk_in_Ubuntu.3F
[20:01] <geirha> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#How_do_I_resize_the_virtual_disks.3F
[20:02] <realm174_> awesome, thanks! Lots of good info on that page, I'll be reading
