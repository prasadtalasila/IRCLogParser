[11:42] <thorwil> godbyk: happy new year
[11:42] <thorwil> godbyk: seems we need a new naming convention for the titlepage files
[11:44] <thorwil> what would have been lulu-nl.svg could be wrap-nl.svg if we wanted it to be generic
[11:45] <thorwil> but with measurements dependent on the service, createspace-nl.svg might avoid surprises further down the road
[12:10] <thorwil> godbyk: assuming the vertical bleed is the diff between a4 height and cover size, i only need the spine width now
[20:22] <godbyk> thorwil: Should we name them something generic like 'cover-LANG.svg'?
[20:22] <godbyk> Let me get the spine width for you.
[20:24] <godbyk> thorwil: The spine width should be 24.159456 pt (0.335548 in).  (Gotta love those nice round numbers!)
[20:24] <thorwil> godbyk: right now with an old lulu and a new createspace cover in one and the same dir, i don't feel well about a generic name
[20:24] <godbyk> thorwil: We can ditch the lulu covers I think.
[20:24] <thorwil> btw, we could drop the "titlepage-" for all the single side files
[20:25] <godbyk> thorwil: True, though it might make it easier to know if the svg is a title page or cover if we leave it.
[20:25] <thorwil> godbyk: what's with lulu-en_US, then?
[20:25] <godbyk> thorwil: It doesn't matter too much to me. I just type the names once in the LaTeX script and never think about it again. You're the one who has to edit them all the time. :-)
[20:26] <godbyk> thorwil: I didn't remove any of the lulu covers, but we can remove them/rename them if you like.
[20:26] <godbyk> thorwil: Since lulu.com is having trouble printing our books, I'm going to be publishing any new ones through CreateSpace.
[20:27] <thorwil> godbyk: lulu-en_US of 12-04_precise-e2 is not currently in print?
[20:28] <godbyk> thorwil: Correct. precise-e2 edition is allegedly available through lulu.com, but if it's not I'll migrate it to CreateSpace.
[20:28] <thorwil> godbyk: easiest to rename and edit the lulu file, then. don't delete it
[20:28] <godbyk> For 12.10, I used your lulu cover at the CreateSpace site and it worked okay. They said they scaled it, but I'm not sure why.. the numbers appeared to align when I did the math.
[20:28] <godbyk> The printed copy of 12.10  from CreateSpace looks fine, though.
[20:29] <godbyk> thorwil: Okay. I'll leave that up to you.
[20:29] <thorwil> 12.10 – how come i don't even have thta branch checked out
[20:29] <thorwil> that, even
[20:30] <thorwil> godbyk: how about calling the files with "single-" and "double-"?
[20:31] <godbyk> thorwil: I'm okay with that. Whatever makes the most sense to you is fine with me. :)
[20:33] <thorwil> godbyk: ok, i'll add the new file as double-nl.svg later on. please take care of renaming the titlepage-*, as that should happen with updating the script
[20:34] <godbyk> thorwil: I'll do that.
[20:34] <godbyk> thorwil: Thanks for your help!
[20:34] <godbyk> thorwil: I'll probably have some more cover requests coming soon, too.  (Just a heads-up.)
[20:35] <thorwil> godbyk: your welcome. i just take care of crumbs, while you deal with whole slices of the cake :)
[20:36] <godbyk> Mmm.. cake!  :-)
[20:36] <godbyk> thorwil: Oh, one more thing to keep in mind with the covers:
[20:36] <thorwil> s/your/you're/, sheesh as if i have to type the standard mistakes
[20:37] <godbyk> CreateSpace adds an ISBN barcode to the bottom-right cover of the back cover.
[20:37] <godbyk> So when you're designing covers, don't put anything vital in that spot or it will be occluded by the barcode.
[20:37] <godbyk> (With the current covers, this isn't an issue.)
[20:37] <godbyk> thorwil: As long as you don't harp at my on my bad typing days, I'll leave you alone on yours. ;-)
[20:38] <thorwil> can you get the position/measurements of the barcode?
[20:38] <godbyk> Sure. One moment.
[20:39] <godbyk> thorwil: https://www.createspace.com/Products/Book/CoverPDF.jsp
[20:39] <godbyk> It's 2" × 1.2", but it doesn't give the exact position information.
[20:40] <godbyk> On the printed copy that I received, the barcode sites ¼" from the bottom of the trimmed edge and ¼" from the fold of the spine.
[20:43] <thorwil> ty. sucks. no way to relate my layout to that
[20:43] <thorwil> barbarians! :)
[20:47] <CarstenG> Hi Kevin and Thorsten
[20:47] <thorwil> ho CarstenG
[20:47] <CarstenG> Nice to see, that you found another service for printing. :-)
[20:49] <CarstenG> Do they have the possibility, that the customer can decide during the order process if he wants a color or black/white version?
[20:49] <godbyk> CarstenG: I can upload a color edition if you like. It'd be quite a bit pricier, I think.
[20:50] <CarstenG> oh, ok. So the same procedure as at lulu...
[20:50] <godbyk> CarstenG: Yeah, pretty much.
[20:50] <godbyk> CarstenG: Whoever publishes the book decides what format (black-and-white, color, hardcover, paperback, page size, etc.).
[20:51] <godbyk> CarstenG: If you're interested in a color edition, I can create one for you, though.
[20:51] <CarstenG> I will come with this point back to you, when we have finished the German version...
[20:51] <godbyk> CarstenG: Okay.
[20:52] <CarstenG> 28% left to translate...
[20:53] <godbyk> CarstenG: Take your time.. I have plenty of other translations to publish. ;-)
[20:54] <CarstenG> Yeah, great. 5 are nearly ready
[20:54] <CarstenG> and of Malay only the screenshots are missing..
[20:55] <godbyk> Next on my to do list is to see if I can figure out why French words with apostrophes in them aren't being hyphenated properly.
[20:55] <godbyk> (It seems like each translation has its own special issues to be worked out. At least we only have to fix the problem once [most the time].)  :)
[20:58] <CarstenG> You mean something like »s’améliorer.« on page 6 of the French version?
[20:59] <CarstenG> Looks really not aesthetic...
[20:59] <godbyk> CarstenG: Yeah, they're causing overly long lines in a number of places.
[21:00] <godbyk> I'm trying to pin down the cause of the problem now.
[21:01] <CarstenG> Then I have one more problem for you. :-)
[21:01] <godbyk> CarstenG: What's that?
[21:01] <CarstenG> The quotation marks in malay are printed as ?
[21:01] <godbyk> CarstenG: Ah, that should be an easy fix.
[21:01] <CarstenG> And should be as the english ones...
[21:02] <CarstenG> ... as Susah wrote in his email.
[21:02] <godbyk> Ookay.
[21:03] <godbyk> CarstenG: Are they working on precise-e2 or quantal (or both)?
[21:04] <CarstenG> on precise-e2
[21:04] <godbyk> Okay.
[21:08] <thorwil> double-nl.svg pushed
[21:09] <godbyk> thorwil: Thanks!
[21:09] <godbyk> I'll upload it and see if it complains about anything.
[21:11] <godbyk> thorwil: Oops! I forgot to send you Dutch text for the back cover.
[21:11] <godbyk> Lemme find that for you.
[21:12] <CarstenG> I was also wondering about that. :-)
[21:12] <CarstenG> Only english there. :-)
[21:12] <thorwil> godbyk: that happens when i switch from debugging clojure, try to figure out why ardour 2 doesn'tbuild and try to finish a titlepage svg ;)
[21:13] <thorwil> otherwise i surely would have remembered to actually check the text
[21:13] <godbyk> thorwil: Heh.. no problem! :-)
[21:14] <CarstenG> This is one idea for the raring manual: Can we include all these texts to the pot file so that they are available on LP?
[21:14] <godbyk> It looks like it should be the same text as for the lucid-e1 cover.
[21:14] <godbyk> CarstenG: Possibly. We should look into that.
[21:15] <godbyk> CarstenG: Hannie and I were talking the other day and we'd like to rewrite this cover text anyway.
[21:16] <godbyk> thorwil: I've emailed you the old lucid-e1 Dutch covers.  The text on the back cover should be the same for precise-e2.
[21:26] <thorwil> godbyk: i copied the text from that branch
[21:26]  * thorwil has them all collected
[21:26] <godbyk> thorwil: So organized!  (More so than I!)
[21:26] <thorwil> godbyk: better have Hannie take a look at it
[21:26] <godbyk> thorwil: I'll do that.
[21:27] <thorwil> have to run, cya
[23:18] <CarstenG> Ok, see you tomorrow.
[23:19] <CarstenG> bye
