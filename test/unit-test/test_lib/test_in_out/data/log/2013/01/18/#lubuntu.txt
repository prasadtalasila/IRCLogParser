[00:09] <jirido> Ok! thanx
[00:09] <Unit193> What version of Lubuntu?
[00:10] <jirido> 12.04
[00:11] <Inside> halp
[00:11] <Inside> does lubuntu work with virtualPC?
[00:12] <Inside> I get a seg fault right when I go to install it..
[00:13] <holstein> Inside: theres nothing lubuntu is doing to prevent being installed in virtualization
[00:13] <holstein> Inside:  i do it with virtualbox often
[00:13] <Inside> hmmm
[00:13] <holstein> Inside: i would check the iso.. test with other known good iso's
[00:15] <Unit193> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QuantalQuetzal/ReleaseNotes/Lubuntu#Known_Issues  All the known Lubuntu Quantal install issues.
[00:16] <holstein> Inside: virtual PC might not support lubuntu.. virtualbox will run on whatever operating system you are using
[00:16]  * Inside sighs ._.
[00:18] <holstein> http://www.sevenforums.com/virtualization/183447-virtual-pc-ubuntu-11-04-a.html seem relevant, though a bit dated Inside
[00:18] <Inside>  taking a look, thanks

[00:19] <Inside> here's a question -- I'm not sure if lubuntu is what I'm looking for
[00:19] <holstein> Inside: virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/ runs on most any host and supports most any guest
[00:19] <holstein> Inside: download it and run it live.. try lubuntu live
[00:19] <Inside> I really basically need something with a terminal where I can compile stuff.. I don't even really need the windowing manager thing
[00:20] <Inside>  > Microsoft Virtual PC can not run 64-bit guest machines, not even on 64-bit hosts as is your case. You must use 32-bit install media when installing Windows to Virtual PC guest. ah, interesting
[00:20] <holstein> Inside: that would be more like ubuntuserver or minimal.. but you might want lubuntu for that since you might need/want a desktop at first
[00:20] <holstein> Inside: you can run 64bit guests in 32bit virtualbox, but i wouldnt
[00:21] <holstein> Inside: if you are looking to "compile", you might just want to use a live CD... save your work to a USB stick
[00:21] <holstein> Inside: otherwise, you wont take full advantage of the machine
[00:21] <Inside> well and also run a server from the command line
[00:21] <holstein> Inside: server? a windows server?
[00:21] <holstein> Inside: theres not much difference in linux servers and desktops... other than packages and configuration
[00:21] <Inside> no, a game server which only works under nix stuff
[00:22] <holstein> Inside: then, why not compile there?
[00:22] <holstein> Inside: or try using it from a live CD? or USB stick? or in virtualbox?
[00:23] <Inside> er.. that's the point -- I'm looking for a linux flavor which is very light weight where I can compile the stuff that I need from source and then run it
[00:23] <holstein> Inside: puppy is light... lubuntu is
[00:23] <Inside> is.. also ligt?
[00:23] <Unit193> Inside: You may find that Ubuntu server, Ubuntu minimal, or even debian good for that.
[00:23] <holstein> i dont think the lightness is the issue.. you are using virtualization that is not supporting linux
[00:23] <Unit193> If the idea is to have a server.
[00:24] <holstein> xubuntu is not "heavy".. though, if you dont need X, dont install it
[00:24] <Inside> holstein: I'll find a different virtualization thing that'll hopefully work, I just mean something that I can run without it taking up a lot of resources
[00:24] <holstein> Inside: lubuntu is that.. so are plenty of linux distros
[00:24] <wxl> Inside: use virtualbox. it works. you can tweak it to use as much resources as you like. as a guest, lubuntu doesn't use much, especially without x.
[00:24] <Inside> right, I'm getting vbox setup right now

[00:25] <holstein> no need to install lubuntu if you dont want x
[00:27] <Inside> thanks, gonna give it a try!

[03:37] <Guest82748> If I download lubuntu 12.10 now, will I have to update all since the release when installed?
[03:37] <Guest82748> or has been some moment when they have been refreshed?
[04:06] <holstein> Guest82748: updates come in pretty regularly
[04:06] <holstein> Guest82748: i would expect to either update, or just be a bit behind
[04:06] <Guest82748> aah  thanks holstein

[06:52] <karmakosmikk> hi, if i want to install new theme for lubuntu, just download theme file from box-look.org? what is that gtk theme option there?
[07:17] <jirido> is it gtk icons that is in lxapperance?
[07:37] <jirido> How could i change color in the digital clock from black at lxpanel
[10:43] <jirido> Does anyone eventually know how i could change color in the digital clock in lxpanel
[14:54] <lesshaste> prtsc doesn't seem to do anything. how do I take a screen shot of a chromium page?
[15:33] <billhookman> hi, anybody know why I cannot access to software center? It does not load anything to select. synaptic works ok.
[16:58] <theixle> Can I make a single instance of lxterminal start maximized with --geometry or some other means?
[17:07] <holstein> theixle: have you checked out 'lxterm -help' ...i see lots of arguments there
[17:11] <theixle> Yes, all I saw was the geometry one and I tried to use lines/rows but couldn't get it just right
[17:16] <theixle> oh you said 'lxterm' I was looking at 'lxterminal'
[17:32] <holstein> theixle: sorry.. i looked at both just now, and lxterm has much more options
[17:32] <holstein> theixle: will that work? im not sure how to do that with lxterminal.. maybe in #lxde?
[17:34] <theixle> I was able to run xterm maximized, lxterm returns an error
[17:34] <theixle> It might work once I adjust the default font
[18:02] <drachensun> hello, does any one know how I can change the text size of the start menu?
[18:02] <rejven> hi, im new to 12.10, i was wondering what is the easiest way to create desktop shortcut for folders or .txt files, thanks
[18:03] <drachensun> I'm using a touch screen and I've managed to talk all the other icons and text bigger but that
[18:04] <drachensun> to change the all the other icons than that I mean
[19:50] <Cong> Is there a menu editor for this?
