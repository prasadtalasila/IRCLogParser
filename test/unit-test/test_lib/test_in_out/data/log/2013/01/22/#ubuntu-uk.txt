[07:44] <knightwise> morning
[08:21] <andylockran> hey all
[08:22] <andylockran> anyone here run a company that can give me some Joomla support - 3 days per month?
[08:22] <TheOpenSourcerer> Almost certainly Andy
[08:22] <TheOpenSourcerer> andylockran: ^^
[08:23] <andylockran> TheOpenSourcerer: can I have a contact nunmer Alan?
[08:23] <TheOpenSourcerer> sure: Office: 0844 3576000.
[08:24] <andylockran> You in the office now?
[08:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> andylockran: You tried Yopla ?
[08:30] <solarcloud_3scrn> scrub that... soz
[08:54] <andylockran> reading through the man page of automysqlbackup - any suggestions to have it mysqldump from mulitple mysql instances?
[08:54] <andylockran> in ubuntu, it seems you're only allowed to use /etc/default/automysqlbackup as the config
[08:54] <andylockran> whereas I have multiple configs in /etc/automysqlbackup/$host.config that I'd like to use.
[08:55] <diplo> I've always wrote my own andylockran, can take a look if you like ?
[08:56] <TheOpenSourcerer> andylockran: I've hacked the automysqlbackup to do what I need. It's only bash ;-)
[08:56] <diplo> I have a very simple shell script that connects and dumps from each of our customers web hosts
[09:07] <andylockran> TheOpenSourcerer: yeah, I should hack it up.
[09:10] <popey> morning
[09:30] <timp> s
[09:32] <knightwise> s!
[09:33] <iahmad> Hi David
[09:38]  * popey tickles GingerDog 
[10:10] <JamesTait> Good morning all! :-D
[10:17] <knightwise> hey JamesTait
[10:19] <JamesTait> knightwise, o/
[10:22] <knightwise> hey michelle_ !
[10:24] <DJones> Would anybody recommend an online radio app for ubuntu, ideally I'd like one that will let me add internet radio stations and have buttons for presets for favourite stations
[10:27] <knightwise> I use spotify to be honest
[10:27] <knightwise> not bad actually
[10:27] <knightwise> but thats not what you are lookin for i'm afraid
[10:28] <mungbean> online app? or app for online radio?
[10:28] <DJones> app for online radio, i want things like radio 4 & various local radios as presets
[10:29] <mungbean> don't they all do it? banshee, amarok etc
[10:29] <mungbean> i used to listen to internet radio on amarok
[10:29] <knightwise> mungbean: indeed.
[10:29] <DJones> I didn't even consider those
[10:29] <knightwise> DJones: If you have a mobile device I would give Stitcher a go.
[10:30] <mungbean> clementine is my preferred audio player app over the last couple of years
[10:30] <DJones> +1 for clementine
[10:30] <DJones> Although I thought it just did lastfm streaming for radio
[10:32] <DJones> Just having a look at Radio Tray
[10:32] <mungbean> http://radiotray.sourceforge.net/
[10:32] <mungbean> yeah lol
[10:32] <mungbean> just foound it
[10:34] <popey> i use tune in radio on ios and android for radio stuff
[10:35] <popey> it's a really great radio app
[10:35] <popey> it's my alarm clock too, it can wake up to the radio (any stream you like) and also record shows
[10:35] <directhex> i wonder whether WP8's hardware certification requires an FM radio the way WP7 did, for no good reason
[10:35] <DJones> I use that on android, just hoping I can find a decent desktop app
[10:39] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[10:40] <knightwise> ²hey brobostigon
[10:40] <knightwise> you're up late :p
[10:40] <knightwise> its allmost noon
[10:40] <brobostigon> hey knightwise
[10:41] <brobostigon> knightwise: remeber, you are an hour ahead of us. :)
[10:43] <knightwise> ah yes :) I always tend to forget that one over here
[10:44] <brobostigon> :)
[10:46] <dwatkins> remember folks, if you're going to cycle to work along the canal in the snow, make sure your panniers are waterproof - I fell in tiday :)
[10:46] <dwatkins> *today
[10:47] <popey> you fell in the canal?!
[10:47] <brobostigon> ouchie, :(
[10:47]  * directhex stays at home in the warm
[10:47] <mungbean> oof
[10:48] <dwatkins> popey: yep, was a bit concerned for a moment that I might not get out, but was fine
[10:48] <dwatkins> my phones are drying
[10:49] <popey> dwatkins reminds me of https://twitter.com/Uk_Sniper1/status/292321931183652865
[10:49] <dwatkins> popey: haha
[10:49] <dwatkins> I hope the dog was ok
[10:50] <dwatkins> https://twitter.com/glymph/status/293671952458076161
[10:50] <dwatkins> that's me
[10:51] <Seeker`> dwatkins: how deep was it?
[10:51] <dwatkins> Seeker`: not sure, I couldn't feel the bottom
[10:52] <mungbean> which canal?
[10:52] <dwatkins> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_Canal_(Scotland)
[10:52] <mungbean> sounds cold
[10:52] <dwatkins> haha, it's only 5 feet deep :D
[10:52] <Seeker`> Probably warmer than the surrounding air, unless it was frozen over :P
[10:52] <Laney> O_O
[10:52] <dwatkins> mungbean: surprisingly it wasn't that cold, despite other parts of the canal being iced over
[10:54] <dwatkins> I think I was about here: http://goo.gl/maps/YSrqz
[10:54] <dwatkins> it was almost worth it for the look on my boss's face, though
[10:55] <dwatkins> I calmly told her how I'd fallen in and she couldn't believe it, especially since I was standing in front of her in dry clothes (they'd been in the pannier which hadn't gone under water)
[10:55] <mungbean> cycling naked again...
[10:55] <dwatkins> haha

[11:33] <michelle_> Hey knightwise :)
[11:35] <davidmarais> can anybody help me? My computer crashed and now I have lost all my IRC channels. My channels are still under my preferences but my IRC is not logging into them.
[12:24] <davmor2> czajkowski: prod just cause I haven't in ages
[12:25] <davmor2> davidmarais: what client do you use
[12:25] <davmor2> michelle_: hello stranger
[12:26] <diplo> hah you scared them off davmor2 :D
[12:27] <davmor2> diplo: it's my magnetic personality some I attract other I repel :D
[12:27] <diplo> heh
[12:28] <davmor2> morning all by the way, I got caught up in discussions else where
[12:28] <brobostigon> that reminds me of a joke, data made in the star trek film, generations.
[12:36] <davmor2> brobostigon: you suck at this don't you, you don't come out with half a statement like that and not complete it with the joke ;)
[12:38] <brobostigon> davmor2: haha, i am sure most here have seen it, and know the bit i was refferring to.
[12:39] <davmor2> brobostigon: I've seen it but when it was first released I can't remember that far back ;)
[12:39] <brobostigon> davmor2: ah, i see. ok.
[13:13] <knightwise> data joke ! Lol :)
[13:46] <Laney> wtf
[13:46] <Laney> *yesterday* I bought a subscription to the Guardian crossword app
[13:46] <Laney> today: Unfortunately, since introducing this subscription model, the uptake has been less than we would have hoped. As a result, we have taken the
[13:46] <Laney> +difficult decision to end our work on and support for our Android crosswords app.
[13:47] <popey> haha
[13:50] <Laney> perhaps it has something to do with the fact that there was no in-app indication that there even was a trial period
[13:50] <Laney> so after two weeks the crosswords just stop coming with no message to tell you why
[13:53] <gord> aren't there thousands of pre-existing crossword apps?
[13:53] <czajkowski> davmor2: ello just going on lunch bbiab
[13:57]  * popey pokes jnick_tait with http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTpUVAcvWfU
[13:58] <ali1234> lol eraserhead
[13:59] <jnick_tait> mr popey, you were very correct and i was very kerrong... in my defence i would say that i was think of this curiousity.... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpgyVxP8OG8
[13:59] <popey> :D
[13:59] <Laney> oh gord
[14:00] <popey> ok thats odd
[14:08] <jnick_tait> popey, i thought it might appeal to your sense of the not quite right
[14:17] <directhex> apparently adding openjdk-7-jre to an ubuntu iso makes it not fit on a cd.
[14:18] <d3ngar> That's very sad...
[14:19] <popey> it doesnt fit on a cd anyway
[14:20] <directhex> if i pulled openjdk and crashplan back off, it'd fit
[14:20] <directhex> removing qt helps
[14:20] <knightwise> Ick !
[14:20] <knightwise> Java !
[14:23]  * knightwise is wrestling with the current java expliot at work
[14:24] <directhex> knightwise, yeah, i know, java is basically worse than hitler. sadly, that's business for you
[14:29] <knightwise> LOL
[14:29] <directhex> i don't think i can free up another ~45 meg to make this fit on a CD.
[14:31] <knightwise> directhex: dump Java :) be nice to the users
[14:32] <directhex> knightwise, do you have a non-java version of CrashPlan's backup client?
[14:35] <knightwise> directhex: I feel your pain
[14:42] <dwatkins> directhex: I would like to see that, as it slows my Mac at work down
[14:55]  * d3ngar actually likes Java a lot
[14:58] <directhex> sadly, java is still the top choice for cross-platform Enterprise(tm) software
[14:58] <dwatkins> indeed, directhex
[14:58] <d3ngar> Ys
[14:59] <directhex> doesn't make it any less bad than hitler though
[14:59] <d3ngar> I'm no developer, but in our company I do the occasional bit of deskopt app
[14:59] <dwatkins> that escalated fast
[15:00] <d3ngar> directhex: as a Jew I don't like the Hitler comparison, I know you are trying to be quirky, but it's not that great
[15:00] <d3ngar> And when I do need to write something that works on all platforms, I generally like using Java
[15:01] <d3ngar> I quite like Python as a language, but you have to install all sorts of additional things to make the same programme run on different machines
[15:01] <d3ngar> Not so good
[15:01] <d3ngar> Java is better in that regard
[15:03] <directhex> java's fine as long as you don't expect end-users to interact with it (since java apps always feel extremely heavy) and have buckets of ram lying around (since java's ram consumption is extraordinarily high). funnily enough it's fast, for pure cpu-bound code.
[15:05] <d3ngar> directhex: agreed. Which they would have done something about Java's extensive RAM usage, but I guess it's what it is.
[15:05] <Laney> bah
[15:05] <Laney> always freezing when returning from lunch
[15:05] <directhex> quit moaning. i'm still snowed in
[15:06] <dwatkins> Laney: I refuse to accept any complaints about it being cold, I fell into the canal this morning on my bike ;)
[15:06] <Laney> heh
[15:06] <Laney> how was the rest of the journey?
[15:07] <dwatkins> wet
[15:07] <Laney> 14.6° in here
[15:07] <dwatkins> 12 parsecs here
[15:07] <Laney> actually that's downstairs, colder up 'ere
[15:07] <dwatkins> oh sorry, that's degrees, that is pretty cold
[15:08] <dwatkins> parts of the canal were frozen
[15:08] <Laney> nice
[15:08] <Laney> did the electronics survive?
[15:08] <dwatkins> one phone did, I think - the other is still drying
[15:08] <dwatkins> thankfully I didn't have my iPad nor laptop with me (don't normally take them on the bike anyway)
[15:10] <Laney> I wonder if my waterproof panniers would survive a dunk like that
[15:10] <dwatkins> Laney: I hadn't done mine up correctly, big mistake
[15:11] <dwatkins> they hold water very well, though.... once it's got in
[15:11] <Laney> doh
[15:11] <Laney> I know a guy who got hugged off his bike into a canal by a drunk chap once
[15:11] <dwatkins> how mean
[15:12] <Laney> it was a brompton as well, which I bet made it look even more amusing
[15:12]  * Laney looks at sladen
[15:40] <einonm> Hmm. Looks like Ubuntu got a +1 due to Fedora getting a -1 from Alan Cox https://plus.google.com/u/0/111104121194250082892/posts/aCiB7kTLXTh

[19:04] <Azelphur> Seems I'm still getting this gedit issue, it's odd nobody else seems affected, I did a fresh install to 12.10 and it's still happening :s
[19:05] <Azelphur> that is, minimise gedit -> you no longer have a text cursor
[19:05] <daftykins> XD
[19:05] <daftykins> carat plays hide and seek?
[19:06] <popey> a text cursor?
[19:06] <popey> how are you minimising gedit and where dont you see the text cursor?
[19:07] <Azelphur> I'll make a video to be more descriptive, one second
[19:13] <Azelphur> ah, more interesting, it seems to only happen when I'm doing a mouse gesture, perhaps it's related to me holding middle click while minimising
[19:14] <Azelphur> yea this seems fairly reproducible, hold down middle click and use a keycombo to minimise gedit (usually alt+F9)
[19:14] <Azelphur> and now you have no text cursor, enjoy xD
[19:15] <Azelphur> I bet someone can replicate that now I understand what causes it
[19:17] <Azelphur> popey: https://www.dropbox.com/s/nn3qu5e4cjf8s1w/2013-01-22%2019.08.12.mp4?m video uploaded
[19:21] <popey> alt+f9 doesn't minimise here
[19:25] <Azelphur> popey: yea, I've had it set in compiz for a few releases, I guess they changed it at some point
[19:26] <Azelphur> I dunno what it's set to now, it'll be in the general tab of ccsm I think
[19:27] <Azelphur> just thought, I can easily try and replicate this on my laptop, see if I get anywhere
[19:36] <Azelphur> nope, gah. Can't reproduce it on my laptop
[20:15] <daftykins> the voice of Azelphur :O
[20:16] <Azelphur> indeed
[20:16] <Azelphur> since it seems to just be a bug with my weird setup, I found a workaround
[20:16] <daftykins> Azelphur: curiously it appears to have left before the window even 'peels' away
[20:16] <Azelphur> fun
[20:16] <daftykins> unless that's just how window management goes, sorta 'animations' stop before the redraw
[20:17] <daftykins> Azelphur: what do you mouse middle click for?
[20:18] <Azelphur> daftykins: initiate mouse gesture
[20:18] <daftykins> what kind of things do you do with that?
[20:19] <Azelphur> daftykins: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/screenshots/2013/Jan/2013-01-22-201924_800x1405_scrot.png
[20:20] <daftykins> my word
[20:20] <daftykins> but keyboard shortcuts :'(
[20:20] <Azelphur> I have keyboard shortcuts too, but I often have my hand on the mouse and a gesture is pretty easy
[20:22] <daftykins> ah
[20:22] <Azelphur> this is why I miss the compiz fire plugin though, it was set up with easystroke to display a trail on my mouse when performing a gesture
[20:22] <Azelphur> which was awesome. :<
[20:24] <daftykins> :(
[20:24] <daftykins> i remember a coursemate at Uni using some gesture firefox add-on
[20:24] <daftykins> though i didn't see that being easier to draw a line to go 'back' versus hitting the hardware mouse button, if you have one
[20:25] <Azelphur> yea, it shines with things like close/maximise/minimise
[20:25] <Azelphur> as those buttons are annoyingly small
[20:33] <popey> \o/ my hand never leaves the keyboard for the mouse ☺
[20:34] <Azelphur> hehe
[20:34] <daftykins> ^
[20:34] <popey> i use alt+space, n  for minimise, and alt+space, x for maximise
[20:34] <daftykins> i try to avoid mousing
[20:34] <popey> have done for many many years
[20:55] <constrictor> I am getting unable to find suitable address error when trying to mount a NAS share any help ?
[20:56] <daftykins> what's your mount command?
[20:57] <constrictor> sudo mount -t cifs -o user=administrator,password=mypassword //192.168.0.11/share /home/kwabena/Netdrive
[20:57] <popey> has the IP of the NAS changed>?
[20:57] <popey> that IP doesn't look static
[20:58] <constrictor> the ip is the same
[20:58] <popey> so you can ping it?
[20:58] <daftykins> are those slashes right for the device side 0o
[20:58] <constrictor> yep I am getting 100% responses

[21:37] <popey> is there another thing holding the webcam open?
[21:37] <popey> like cheese or another webcam process running in screen?

[21:48] <brobostigon> popey: ie, there is some existing issue?
