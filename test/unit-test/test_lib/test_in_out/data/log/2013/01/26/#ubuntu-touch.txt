[09:16] <WebVisitor-0> hey everyone, I am a somewhat newbie to ubuntu
[09:16] <WebVisitor-0> looking to set up multitouch gestures on my laptop, i tried touchegg and i don't think its compatible with my hardware
[09:16] <WebVisitor-0> any suggestions from anyone here
[11:35] <ktogias> Hi all.
[11:37] <ktogias> I got a sony vaio duo 11 ultrabook with N-trig DuoSense multitouch screen
[11:38] <ktogias> the output of lsinput is http://pastebin.com/JCDkaRw6
[11:40] <ktogias> The multitouch seems to semi-work under ubuntu 12.10... After running ntrig calib.sh as decribed in https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch/Calibration/Ntrig it responds to two-finger touches but not to one finger...
[11:42] <ktogias> calib.sh output is http://pastebin.com/hNeu5Q3V
[11:42] <ktogias> It gives an error ls: cannot access /sys/bus/hid/drivers/ntrig/*1B96*: No such file or directory
[11:42] <ktogias> basename: missing operand
[11:44] <ktogias> mtdev-test output is at http://pastebin.com/TX7seCeG
[11:48] <ktogias> with geisview i see that just after running calib.sh a single touch is interpereted as 2 touches. one at the position of the finger and the other at 1920, 1080 corner of the screen... Subsequent single touches are not identified. it caches ony 2-finger touches...
[11:48] <ktogias> Any hints please?
[11:48] <ktogias> On how to go on testing, or where to look for possible solution?
[11:51] <ktogias> before running calib.sh I also get (EE) [dix] N-trig DuoSense: unable to find touch point 1 in xorg.log
[12:53] <ktogias> Sorry... I have a realy bad internet connection... I was disconnected.. if anyone replied to me, please repeat...
