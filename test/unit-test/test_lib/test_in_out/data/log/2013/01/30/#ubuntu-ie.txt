[10:36] <andru183_> getting back into the college grove... which means trying to use screen again.... which means failing
[10:36] <ebel> aye screen can be a pain. but it allows you to do some things
[10:37] <ebel> You could look at tmux? it's a screen-analog?
[10:37] <slashbel> man screen
[10:38] <andru183_> it's cool, I'll just have to get used to it again
[10:38] <andru183_> it's good once you get the hang of it
