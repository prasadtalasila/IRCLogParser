[01:31] <tgm4883> bobweaver, in one of the frontend setup menus you can set the volume
[01:31] <tgm4883> bobweaver, reading the backlog. I still don't think that unity should know anything about mythtv
[01:32] <tgm4883> Unity currently doesn't know anything about mythtv, so if you are trying to do something different that you need from mythtv, we need to figure out the best way to get it to you
[01:33] <tgm4883> From the beginning, I've wanted this to be something that you could use any backend you wanted with it. Making Unity know about Mythtv seems to conflict with that
[01:33] <tgm4883> trijntje, I believe lenses are actually pretty small
[01:34] <tgm4883> trijntje, the scopes feed them bundles of information for them to present
[01:34] <tgm4883> trijntje, bobweaver so while mythtv can be a large complicated beast, Unity (and also the lens) only know about [Bundle of info from scope]
[01:35] <tgm4883> *Where that bundle of information would be (icon, title, subtitle, starttime, endtime, etc)
[01:37] <bobweaver> again tgm4883  I am in a place of hurry up and wait where* I can not do anything
[01:38] <tgm4883> bobweaver, but what I'm saying makes sense right? we don't want Unity to know about mythtv right?
[01:39] <bobweaver> all I know is that Ubuntu TV mock up code is the nly thing that was out there for me to work on so that is what I did.  I made just like many other opensource thingys something that would work for me
[01:40] <tgm4883> bobweaver, so lets get a list together of the things you've got in Unity that reference mythtv directly (eg. not though the scope) and lets see if we can get the scope to give you what you want
[01:40] <bobweaver> But that said I dont care what unity sees or does All I care about is having a working thing that I can use
[01:42] <tgm4883> ok, I'm just saying that isn't something we should distribute for production use
[01:42] <tgm4883> and remember, this talk of not baking mythtv stuff into unity is coming from the Mythbuntu developer ;)
[01:42] <bobweaver> tgm4883, There is way more to it then just that.
[01:43] <bobweaver> there is a long list of things that alot people are waiting on before we can even touch code
[01:43] <bobweaver> till then it is the hurry up and wait game for me
[01:45] <bobweaver> I guess that I do not want to double over my code 40 X
[01:46] <tgm4883> bobweaver, that makes sense. Are we still talking about just the MythTV stuff
[01:47] <bobweaver> yeah
[01:48] <tgm4883> bobweaver, ok, but is the end goal to have Unity know about mythtv or not?
[01:49] <bobweaver> yeah that makes sense
[01:50] <tgm4883> to have it separate?
[01:51] <tgm4883> bobweaver, so is there stuff though that the scope isn't making available? or is it something else?
[01:52] <bobweaver> Ubuntu TV if Ubuntu Tv there is many things that it is going to be able to do
[01:52] <bobweaver> the scope only gives me 3 things atm
[01:52] <bobweaver> uri name and comment
[01:52] <bobweaver> and icon hint sorry 4
[01:53] <bobweaver> it could pass more things but to what interface
[01:53] <bobweaver> there is no Unity 3d interface
[01:53] <bobweaver> fo 12.10 ->13.whatever
[01:55] <tgm4883> ok, so were waiting for unity to support passing more things from lens to Unity?
[01:57] <bobweaver> nope
[01:57] <bobweaver> but that would be nice
[02:02] <bobweaver> tgm things that would help are things like fanart cover art banners and things like that directors actors plot you have as'comments' imbd numbers and tvdb/tmdb everything that the services offer
[02:18] <tgm4883> bobweaver, ok, if that stuff if available, then how should I pass it to you? to my knowledge there are only a few things I can set
[02:18] <tgm4883> I suppose I need to screw with the URI
[02:19] <tgm4883> or rather, I would need to look into everything that unity can actually see from a lens
[02:19] <tgm4883> I suppose I need to look into lenses a bit more
[02:20] <tgm4883> perhaps a discussion with david calle is in my future
[02:21] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  you know how you are assing comments
[02:21] <bobweaver> passing *
[02:22] <tgm4883> let me refresh my memory
[02:22]  * tgm4883 looks at bzr branch
[02:22] <bobweaver> comments === plot
[02:22] <tgm4883> ok
[02:22] <bobweaver> there are other things that you can pass into unity just like that
[02:22] <bobweaver> all of the names though I do not know
[02:23] <bobweaver> only for ubuntu 12.04 so I know
[02:23] <tgm4883> bobweaver, well I'm only doing http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1529730/
[02:24] <tgm4883> bobweaver, so I'm guessing that the lens is doing something with it
[02:24] <tgm4883> I'm not doing "MODEL['DESCRIPTION']='BLAH'"
[02:25] <tgm4883> so either Unity or the lens is getting that and it knows that the 6th item is the description
[02:25] <tgm4883> now if I could pass something like a dictionary, that would be completely different (and better IMO)
[02:25] <bobweaver> this is what I see
[02:25] <bobweaver> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529736/
[02:25] <tgm4883> but IDK how that would work on the unity side
[02:27] <tgm4883> bobweaver, right, so what that is doing is appending at item to a list. That item knows that the first thing is the URI, the second is the icon, and so on
[02:27] <tgm4883> I'm not saying "set description to 'this'"
[02:27] <tgm4883> I'm saying set the 6th item to 'this'
[02:28] <tgm4883> which is quite a bit different, although they don't look that different
[02:29] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  I would say just stay on the cource that Unity 3d uses and just market the scope at that
[02:29] <tgm4883> bobweaver, somewhere, something else knows that the 6th thing is suppose to be the description
[02:29] <tgm4883> perhaps the lens
[02:29]  * tgm4883 looks at videos lens
[02:33] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I think it's the lens that is doing that
[02:33] <tgm4883> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~unity-lens-videos/unity-lens-video/trunk/view/head:/src/unity-lens-video
[02:34] <tgm4883> lines 312-317
[02:35] <tgm4883> wait, nm, I think that is the local scope
[02:40] <mhall119> tgm4883: what are you trying to do?
[02:41] <tgm4883> mhall119, we're just discussing what information can be passed to unity from a scope
[02:42] <mhall119> not much right now
[02:42] <tgm4883> There seems to be a surprising lack of things we can pass to unity based on the amount of metadata things have these days
[02:42] <tgm4883> yea
[02:43] <mhall119> tgm4883: that's changing
[02:43] <tgm4883> mhall119, yea that is what bobweaver was kinda saying
[02:43] <mhall119> I think by the end of this month, but I'm not sure
[02:44] <mhall119> but it should make it easier to send, say, guide data
[02:45] <tgm4883> mhall119, sweet
[02:45] <tgm4883> mhall119, I'd like to send about 5 things for guide data, and then extra stuff if a preview is selected
[02:47] <mhall119> previews already allow any number of key/value pairs
[02:48] <tgm4883> mhall119, yea, but it's the non-preview stuff we need to make sense of
[02:48] <tgm4883> things like StartTime, EndTime, etc
