[15:35] <drott> i am working on touch features for EFL webkit, my environment is ubuntu 12.04 - is there a way i can disable the three finger and four finger gestures?
[15:37] <dandrader> drott, only if you use a shell other than Unity.
[15:38] <drott> dandrader: or I guess, recompiling unityshell and patch these out? but you're saying there is no setting?
[15:39] <dandrader> drott, or that. no there's no such setting.
[15:40] <drott> dandrader: alright, thanks
