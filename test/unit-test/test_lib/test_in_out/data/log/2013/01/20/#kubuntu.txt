[12:13] <Yamakazi> mlm all,,
[12:14] <lordievader> Hey Yamakazi, how are you?
[12:15] <Yamakazi> fine,, and u,
[12:15] <lordievader> Yamakazi: I'm doing well, thank you for asking.
[12:15] <Yamakazi> u wlcome,
[12:47] <invariant> Can you tell me  line number and file of where X  (the X server) is started in Kubuntu?
[12:47] <invariant> I am using kdm.
[12:50] <lordievader> invariant: You are probably looking for /etc/init/kdm.conf
[12:52] <invariant> lordievader, I am not seeing the binary X being called.
[12:52] <invariant> lordievader, I want to influence the parameters of X.
[12:54] <lordievader> invariant: My lightdm script (12.10) has the line "exec lightdm", I think kdm.conf has "exec kdm". This is probably starting X on it's own. If that does not work you could disable the kdm.conf and write your own init script.
[12:55] <invariant> lordievader, so, the answer is: kdm starts X in some binary file and if you want to modify it, you need to recompile kdm, or use a different dm, but you also don't know which dm will enable me to do that.
[12:56] <invariant> In short, the easiest solution is likely to start X manually without any dm.
[12:56] <lordievader> invariant: So you write your own init script, have the script start X and have .xinit (or .xsession) start the dm.
[12:56] <invariant> lordievader, is that even possible?
[12:57] <invariant> lordievader, I am pretty sure that's not how it works.
[12:57] <invariant> The display manager needs to control the X server.
[12:57] <invariant> That's the whole point.
[12:57] <tsimpson> invariant: you can configure how X runs by modifying the files in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/
[12:59] <invariant> tsimpson, there are still tons of files there.
[12:59] <lordievader> invariant: In that way I have modified a live-cd to start fluxbox. I made a startx.conf in /etc/init, that would run "startx" and the .xinit file had "startfulxbox".
[12:59] <invariant> tsimpson, all I want is the line which starts X and convert it into X -core.
[13:04] <tsimpson> invariant: /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc I think
[13:06] <invariant> tsimpson, how was I supposed to know that?
[13:07] <invariant> tsimpson, thanks for finding it, but don't you think that such things should be easier to find?
[13:07] <tsimpson> invariant: well I didn't know about it either, I just found it
[13:08] <invariant> tsimpson, I'd say that in a good system, you can just run something like pstree and click your way up and see on which line of which file (even if it's binary) something was done.
[13:08] <tsimpson> the whole X infrastructure is a mystery to most
[13:08] <lordievader> tsimpson: There are books ranting about X11...
[13:09] <invariant> lordievader, also about UNIX.
[13:09] <invariant> They are mostly right.
[13:10] <tsimpson> there's probably a bunch of fork()'ing before X actually gets called
[13:10] <wakeup> Hello everyone,
[13:10] <wakeup> I am currently translating documents into Turkish.
[13:10] <wakeup> When I follow the link Help Translate on Launchpad, it suggested me translating oneiric templates. I almost complete translations, but today I saw another translations of kubuntu-docs on Raring trunk list.
[13:10] <wakeup> Should I continue the translation with oneiric (https://translations.launchpad.net/k...eiric/+lang/tr) or did I waste my time by not translating Raring files (https://translations.launchpad.net/u...50&start=150)? Because I cannot see my old translations in Raring files.
[13:11] <lordievader> invariant: X11 is needlesly complicated if you ask me...
[13:11] <tsimpson> wakeup: the folks in #kubuntu-devel would know more about how the translation system works
[13:11] <wakeup> ok thanks :). i will move into that channel then...
[13:12] <lordievader> wakeup: Good luck!
[13:26] <invariant> lordievader, I think you can only make such a judgement call if you know the current system inside out.
[13:26] <invariant> You can write an X11 haters book if you are really sure, or an alternative implementation with the exact same features that's much smaller.
[13:30] <lordievader> invariant: Yes, you are quite right.

[14:30] <BluesKaj> Hey folks
[14:36] <invariant> The aptitude shipped in 12.04 is broken. How can I install the one from quantal?
[14:38] <ikonia> you don't
[14:38] <BluesKaj> !aptitude
[14:38] <ubottu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[14:38] <ikonia> you should never mix distro version packages
[14:39] <invariant> Ok, so after I have converted my installation scripts to use aptitude I can switch it back to the less efficient apt-get again. Great!
[14:39] <invariant> There are  over 350 people who have that problem on launchpad. Why was it even included in the distribution in the first place?
[14:40] <invariant> Don't you run automatic tests or something like that such that you don't need those 350 people to tell you about a problem?
[15:23] <SpartanF31> hallo! There is a way to see in samba shares the available machines over the lan  and at the same time hide my one?
[15:27] <BluesKaj> !crosspost |  SpartanF31
[15:27] <ubottu> SpartanF31: Please don't ask the same question in multiple Ubuntu channels at the same time. Many helpers are in more than one channel and it's not fair to them or the other people seeking support.

[16:42] <sbivol> ed3456765456: unlock widgets. remove all the panels you have on the desktop. then right-click on the desktop, Add Panel -> default panel

[20:47] <IceGuest_75> hello, who can help me?
[20:59] <theadmin> Hello everyone. I have a seriously annoying problem. After a while after the system login, the sound completely dissapears. Nothing solves it but a reboot, so the end result is I have to reboot every hour or so if I want to keep sound working. Seems to be KDE-specific, but I'm not completely certain of that.
[21:00] <theadmin> The Phonon backend in use is gstreamer, and I do have pulseaudio installed, although I'm experiencing the same issue without pulse.
[21:01] <BluesKaj> theadmin, which sound card/ chip?
[21:02] <theadmin> BluesKaj: 00:14.2 Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI SBx00 Azalia (Intel HDA) (rev 40)
[21:03] <theadmin> This happened yesterday after a kernel update, but I don't think that can be related. Who knows, though, the kernel is mysterious.
[21:03] <theadmin> Well... actually I'm wrong, this started happening before the update.
[21:03] <theadmin> So, ignore that
[21:03] <BluesKaj> ok theadmin , first run , sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel , if the driver loads there won't be any output
[21:04] <theadmin> BluesKaj: It did load
[21:04] <theadmin> BluesKaj: Still no sound though.
[21:06] <BluesKaj> then  with root permissions open /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf , and add this line to the bottom , options snd-hda-intel index=0 , then save the file and reboot
[21:07] <BluesKaj> that line should make the kernel source module/driver persistent, thea
[21:07] <BluesKaj> theadmin,^
[21:08] <theadmin> BluesKaj: Done. I'll reboot, but since the sound works for a while after booting I won't be able to immediately tell whether that's worked.
[21:08] <theadmin> BluesKaj: May I ask what exactly the "index" is?
[21:10] <BluesKaj> index is the sequence that alsa looks at the driver , you can have more than one if the first index listed is unavailabe the 2nd in the list will be used , that's the theory
[21:10] <theadmin> Hm, there are some entries with *negative* indices there though
[21:10] <BluesKaj> it works for my setup , I have 2 soundcards
[21:10] <BluesKaj> yes that means ignore
[21:10] <theadmin> Ah, I see.
[21:11] <theadmin> Okay, thanks. I think that may be the problem, so hope that fixes it. I'll stop by later if the problem reappears. Thanks again.
[21:13] <esing> Hi
[21:13] <esing> Does Kubuntu already come with kde 4.10?
[21:13] <BluesKaj> hi esing
[21:13] <esing> hi BluesKaj
[21:14] <BluesKaj> esing, i think it does now , if you're on 12.10 it should be in the backports
[21:16] <esing> BluesKaj, I guess I can update my applications through backports too?
[21:18] <kotTon_kaNdiy> it's KDE rc2
[21:19] <kotTon_kaNdiy> 4.10 rc2
[21:19] <BluesKaj> esing, I'm not certain , because I'm on 13.04 and it just came down pipe a few daysa go
[21:20] <kotTon_kaNdiy> just checked it
[21:20] <BluesKaj> esing, if it's not in the backports for 12.10 , wait until it is.
[21:21] <BluesKaj> guess I should check my 12.10 install
[21:21] <ikonia> I don't think as a rule of thumb un-released versoins such as 13.04 get backports until it's at least at a stable release stage
[21:23] <BluesKaj> ikonia, well, i'm testing for the devs and it's stable now after the last upgrade
[21:24] <ikonia> BluesKaj: yes, but it changes a lot
[21:24] <ikonia> stable today = broken tomorrow
[21:24] <kotTon_kaNdiy> yup
[21:24] <BluesKaj> yeah , no kidding :)
[21:25] <kotTon_kaNdiy> so I'll wait till they release a 13.10 verion

[21:37] <BluesKaj> nothing yet , my 12.10 install is still running kde 4.9.4 . the update/upgrade/dist-upgrade didn't offer any new kde upgrades
[21:39] <boot> If you have the kubuntu updates ppa, you should be on 4.9.5
[21:39] <BluesKaj> i'm using the backports
[21:39] <esing> Is kubuntu 13.04 like debian unstable to debian testing?
=== Guest68240 is now known as VLanX
=== snaakje_ is now known as snaakje
[21:40] <BluesKaj> esing, probly not a s stable as "debian unstable" at this stage
[21:44] <BluesKaj> esing there's a bug with ubiquity installer with some 64bit AMD hardware/cpus , which i had to workaround by installing 12.10 then upgrading via internet to bypass the ubiquity installer
[21:44] <BluesKaj> on 13.04 that is
[21:46] <esing> Hm, I see
[21:50] <BluesKaj> esing, if you're thinking of testing an RC type OS then make a separate partition for it and keep a stable one as your main OS ...I know it sound like stating the obvious , but I feel it's our duty as kubuntu supporters to say so.
[21:53] <esing> Ye, that is safer to do so. Thanks for the advice
[21:55] <kotTon_kaNdiy> you know how to setup partitions, esing?
[21:57] <kotTon_kaNdiy> there's a good linux verion for it, and it doubles as a rescue disk too
[21:59] <esing> kotTon_kaNdiy, I guess you refer to gparted live cd?
[21:59] <ikonia> you really don't need that
[21:59] <ikonia> the kubuntu cd will work just fine
[22:00] <esing> Ye, kubuntu live cd should have that too
[22:00] <kotTon_kaNdiy> not exactly.  but that's another one you could use
[22:00] <kotTon_kaNdiy> lemme see if I can track it down
[22:00] <kotTon_kaNdiy> been awhile
[22:01] <kotTon_kaNdiy> the one I'm thinking of also had anitvirus software on it
[22:02] <BluesKaj> ikonia, you were mentioning a dns helper a minute ago in kubuntu is that the DNS-DN service discovery monitor in systemsettings > startup and shutdown ?
[22:02] <ikonia> BluesKaj: I don't know how it's implemented in kubuntu to be honest
[22:04] <BluesKaj> ok thanks ikonia , i'll be rebooting again soon and I'll soon find out

[22:11] <Gnosis-> ikonia: no and no
[22:12] <ikonia> wonder if your video card module is crashing then
[22:12] <lordievader> Gnosis-: Check out the logs in /var/log/lightdm they might tell you something.
[22:12] <Gnosis-> hmm. is there some command line way of putting it online?
[22:12] <Gnosis-> oh wait, I know how...
[22:12] <IdleOne> you can use pastebinit
[22:15] <Gnosis-> lordievader / ikonia: here's my /var/log/lightdm/lightdm.log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1553482/
[22:16] <GH0> I seem to be having an issue where isc-dhcp-server starts before my network interface is actually considered up and ready. It attempts to start 8 times during the boot process, and then fails staying off/disabled after boot is completed. At the moment this is the error/problem (dmesg output) http://pastebin.com/MkdJaF3Z , and when doing an ip addr and ifconfig http://pastebin.com/ktYxji1G cont....
[22:17] <GH0> http://pastebin.com/hF4hafYg however, when I manually start the service after boot is complete, everything works fine: http://pastebin.com/7drUhY7G
[22:17] <ikonia> GH0: how is your interface getting an IP address
[22:17] <GH0> I have set the init script to listen only on eth1 the interfaec that I have.
[22:17] <GH0> ikonia: it's static
[22:18] <ikonia> Gnosis-: line 47 is key
[22:18] <ikonia> GH0: then why is it taking so long for the interface to come up
[22:18] <Gnosis-> ikonia: thanks! I'll have a look
[22:18] <lordievader> Gnosis-: I'm seeing a few times /usr/bin/startkde exiting with value 1.
[22:18] <GH0> ikonia: No idea.
[22:18] <Gnosis-> lordievader: how can I see logs for startkde?
[22:19] <GH0> This started happening after I removed a NIC card that wasn't being used.
[22:19] <ikonia> GH0: thats why you need to work out
[22:19] <lordievader> Gnosis-: I think the problem is the same as the one ikonia mentioned.
[22:19] <GH0> Is there any tools (or logs) that can help me figure that out?
[22:20] <ikonia> GH0: disable dhcpd, check the time for the IP to assign
[22:20] <lordievader> GH0: Eth1 does still exist, I presume.
[22:20] <Gnosis-> lordievader: you mean the video card module crashing?
[22:20] <ikonia> boot it into single user mode, start the networking, see how long it takes
[22:21] <ikonia> just work it through
[22:21] <GH0> lordievader: yes, it is up right now.
[22:21] <GH0> Hm, alright.
[22:22] <lordievader> Gnosis-: In line 48 you can see that session 1340 has exited with value 1, session 1340 is:#Import *just* the sqrt function from math on line 3!

[22:22] <lordievader> Err: Session 1340 running command /usr/sbin/lightdm-session /usr/bin/startkde
[22:22] <lordievader> I allways forget firefox does not copy on ctrl+shift+c...
[22:24] <BluesKaj> GH0, have you added the nameserver(s) , domain and search gateway to  /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head , because it overwrites /etc/resolv.conf  ..just ignore the warning, btw
[22:25] <GH0> BluesKaj: No, I haven't. Didn't know that would be required when running isc-dhcp-server or bind9
[22:25] <Gnosis-> lordievader: is that a Python problem, then?
[22:25] <GH0> Both bind9 and isc-dhcp-server are on the same machine anyways.
[22:26] <BluesKaj> GH0, well , I'm not sure about isc-dhcp server , but for static without network manager it's the method we use .
[22:27] <GH0> I am using network manager.
[22:27] <lordievader> Gnosis-: No, I had forgotten that firefox does not copy with ctrl+shift+c, there was still some python stuff in my cache, see 2 lines under that.
[22:27] <Gnosis-> ohhhhh, got it :)
[22:28] <Gnosis-> lordievader: how can I see logs for /usr/bin/startkde? Also, I should mention that I can execute startkde from the command line if I start an X server and set $DISPLAY
[22:30] <BluesKaj> GH0, your setup is foriegn territory to me  ..NM with static unusual IME
[22:32] <lordievader> Gnosis-: Hmm seems there is no such log, you might try the Xorg log or in the lightdm folder the x-0-greeter and x-0 logs.
[22:32] <Gnosis-> okay, thanks
