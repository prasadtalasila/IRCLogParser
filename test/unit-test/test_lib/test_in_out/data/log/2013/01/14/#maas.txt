[13:15] <aberdine> Hello. I'm having a bit of trouble with MAAS provisioned VMware VMs not booting from disk. Where are the logs for each build kept (and is there documentation on where logs & such is? )
[15:20] <roaksoax> rvba: howdy! wwhat was the IPMI bug again?
[15:20] <roaksoax> (the versions and stuff)
[15:25] <rvba> roaksoax: Hi, it was 1086162.
[15:25] <roaksoax> rvba: were you able to look at it and merge it?
[15:25] <roaksoax> bug #1086162
[15:25] <ubot5> bug 1086162 in maas (Ubuntu) "IPMI based power management default to IPMI 1.5 based authentication" [High,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086162
[15:25] <rvba> roaksoax: I'm waiting for your confirmation that the fix I suggest fixes the problem :)
[15:26] <roaksoax> rvba: alright, I'm testing this today :)
[15:26] <rvba> roaksoax: cool.
[16:08] <roaksoax> rvba: i think that for the ipmi version we should default to 2.0
[16:08] <roaksoax> rvba: and whomever is using 1.5 should manually change it
[16:09] <roaksoax> or is it like that already?
[16:10] <rvba> roaksoax: the doc for ipmipower says: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1531116/.  So I think we should keep the "auto selection" by default.
[16:11] <rvba> i.e. not pass anything in "--driver-type=" by default.
[16:11] <roaksoax> right, good point
[16:14] <rvba> roaksoax: btw, not sure you have time for this, but if you have, there is another critical bug in MAAS: #1081660
[16:15] <roaksoax> bug #1081660
[16:15] <ubot5> bug 1081660 in maas-enlist (Ubuntu) "If maas-enlist fails to reach a DNS server, the node will be named ";; connection timed out; no servers could be reached"" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1081660
[16:15] <roaksoax> rvba: alright, will look into that
[16:15] <rvba> ta
[16:15] <roaksoax> rvba: i will upload maas 1.2 to raring
[16:15] <roaksoax> and I'll test that
[16:15] <roaksoax> and see how it goes
[16:16] <rvba> roaksoax: speaking of raring, any idea on bug #1092265 ?
[16:16] <ubot5> bug 1092265 in MAAS "Nodes fail to boot from local disk on raring" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1092265
[16:18] <roaksoax> rvba: that's what i'm gonna test now too :)
[16:18] <rvba> roaksoax: great :)
[16:24] <roaksoax> rvba: so I don't expect that bigjools told you guys anything about the version changes i was planning to make for the upload right?
[16:24] <rvba> roaksoax: does not ring a bell
[16:25] <roaksoax> rvba: alright, so according to the branchs maas/1.2 and maas (trunk). I was thinking on releasing the package as maas-1.2~bzrXYZ for SRU
[16:25] <roaksoax> rvba: and trunk as maas-1.2+bzrXYZ
[16:25] <roaksoax> makes sense?
[16:25] <roaksoax> makes sense to use that versioning?
[16:27] <rvba> roaksoax: isn't it a bit bizarre to have trunk released with a name that contains '1.2'?
[16:28] <roaksoax> rvba: right so we are currently releasing as maas-0.1
[16:28] <roaksoax> :)
[18:52] <roaksoax> rvba: still around?
[21:26] <roaksoax> mat/win 13
[21:26] <roaksoax> err
