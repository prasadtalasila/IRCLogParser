[00:02] <AmEv> Hi
[00:07] <AmEv> Anyone here able to troubleshoot Tegra 2 non-booting problems?
[00:16] <AmEv> Anyway, the tablet I'm trying to install Ubuntu onto is the Toshiba thrive. Biggest possible issue I see? The version of Tegra 2 it is.
[00:18] <AmEv> Is it a Harmony Tegra 2? Nope. Ventana? Nope. It's in its own ball park: the Antares.
[00:18] <RaYmAn> it's irrelevant. It's ventana based, but it doesn't really matter. THe drivers work on any tegra2 as long as it has the right kernel
[00:19] <AmEv> Hmm...
[00:20] <AmEv> Anyway, I'm hitting two things that are happening: Either it stays at the bootup logo, or the screen goes black, and the backlight goes off.
[00:21] <AmEv> I do get some garbled display on HDMI, either way.
[00:21] <AmEv> So, are there some essentials I need to have configured, besides VT and framebuffer console?
[00:22] <RaYmAn> what kernel are you using?
[00:25] <AmEv> I'm trying to build my own, as nobody has released one for the Thrive. However, what I'm starting to use is at this git: https://github.com/pio-masaki/at100-kernel

[00:25] <AmEv> *released a GNU kernel, that is.
[00:28] <infinity> I do wonder if our ac100 kernels might Just Work on it.
[00:28] <AmEv> Compile for Ventana instead of Harmony?
[00:29] <AmEv> Both are Toshiba. That's good news.
[00:30] <infinity> I've never seen a Thrive in person to play with it, but I'd always had a sneaking suspicion that (with the exception of a few peripherals) it's identical to the ac100.  But, who knows.
[00:31] <AmEv> Heh. One of the Thrive devs would love to have an AC100. Can't afford it, though.
[00:31] <infinity> If I were the Toshiba engineers, the ac100 would have just been my devel version of the at100 (cause keyboards are handy for debugging).
[00:31] <AmEv> Downloading AC100 kernel source.
[00:32] <infinity> You could just grab the debs and try the binaries for a quick "hey, maybe this works" smoketest.
[00:32] <AmEv> I've prepared a rootfs on an external SD card already.
[00:33] <AmEv> It's actually a Plasma Active rootfs, but with my touch screen dying (cracked)... At least we have LXDE.
[00:34] <AmEv> Yeah... As nice as a VNC for Android solution is, it's extremely laggy, to the point of almost unusability.
[00:34] <infinity> I've been seriously considering dropping Tegra2 support from future Ubuntu versions.  If people are still actively developing on them, I may need to bring this to a community vote/discussion.
[00:36] <AmEv> Heh. The reason I chose the Thrive about a year ago was because it seemed to be a perfect candidate for Ubuntu.
[00:36] <infinity> Yeah.  And we've had a policy of no-neon-by-default specifically because of the Tegra2 (the only SoC we support that doesn't have NEON).
[00:37] <infinity> It's irksome to keep patching upstream sources for this assumption, but if the target is still widely developed on/with, we may have to stick with it for a bit.
[00:38] <AmEv> Seems that performance development is slowly shifting away from x86 and going to ARM...
[00:39] <infinity> About time.  ARM could use more performance-oriented tweakers.
[00:40] <AmEv> I do like ARM because of its power-performance ratio.
[00:41] <infinity> Yup, and that ratio can only improve as more people start hand-tuning code the same way they've done for x86, rather than falling back to generic C implementations.
[00:41] <infinity> (But NEON is a big part of that story... hand-tuned NEON can be blazingly fast but, sadly, leaves Tegra2 out to dry)
[00:42] <AmEv> I'm no CPU design expert, but it seems that x86 is starting to hit a performance ceiling.
[00:42] <infinity> Well, not all that sad.  Just annoying that ARM allowed NEON to be optional so NVIDIA could make that silly decision.
[00:42] <claes> is this the right place to ask about what rooting option to choose from the google nexus 7 toolkit, to then install multrom and dualboot android and ubuntu?. if so wich rooting option should i choose, its a bit confusing.
[00:43] <infinity> claes: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/Installation has clear unlocking instructions.
[00:44] <infinity> claes: We don't support installing in a dual-boot setup, though, you're on your own for figuring that one out.
[00:44] <claes> ok thanks

[00:48] <AmEv> Well, porting Ubuntu Phone to a spare phone I've got should be fun...
[00:58] <xnox> AmEv: can it run android stock kernel? that would be first step.
[00:59] <AmEv> It's actually a WebOS phone.
[00:59] <AmEv> Meets bare-minimum requirements, with OC...
[01:00] <AmEv> As for the Thrive, should I use the Google cross-compiler toolchain?
[01:02] <AmEv> Got a Ventana Android defconfig...
[01:02] <AmEv> And a Harmony GNU config..
[01:04] <AmEv> Really? No Ventana GNU config on Google?
[01:05] <AmEv> Or is it under another name?
[01:14] <AmEv> Hmmm.. The one guy ported CM10 to the Thrive. Said that the Thrive was almost identical to the Iconia a500....
[01:15] <AmEv> And it's a Harmony board....
[01:17] <lilstevie> AmEv: the Iconia a500 is a picaso board not a harmony board
[01:18] <lilstevie> AmEv: Harmony is the name of one of the dev boards made by nvidia
[01:18] <lilstevie> AmEv: but if you were to compare the device to a dev board it would be closer to ventana
[01:19] <AmEv> Hmmm...
[01:20] <lilstevie> the a500 and the tf101 are almost identical, and the tf201 is almost identical in hardware and config to ventana (except the display)
[01:20] <lilstevie> er
[01:20] <lilstevie> s/tf201/tf101/
[01:20] <lilstevie> been doing too much work on the later one :p
[01:21] <AmEv> I know people have been runing Ubuntu on their Transformers for a while...
[01:21] <AmEv> Lemme see if I can snag the dev in here....
[01:21] <AmEv> Nope.

[09:42] <netchip> where can I get the default initrd for ARMHF?

[11:22] <marvin24> netchip: mkinitramfs?
[11:30] <marvin24> the question which plagues me is if it can be used on a forgein arch (e.g. x86_64) to generate an arm version
[11:30] <marvin24> or do I need to use some changeroot and qemu?
[11:32] <netchip> AFAIK you can
[11:32] <netchip> BTW
[11:32] <netchip> marvin24, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ARM/RootfsFromScratch
[11:39] <marvin24> yes, will try it out
[11:40] <netchip> hum
[11:40] <netchip> how to test if my network connection is OK?
[11:40] <marvin24> I was just wondering if I need to emulate the whole cpu or just use a dir with an arm  filesytem
[11:40] <marvin24> netchip: ping?
[11:41] <netchip> marvin24, isn't installed...
[11:41] <marvin24> ifconfig
[11:41] <marvin24> route ...
[11:42] <netchip> also nopt installed
[11:42] <netchip> how to install without internet connexction?
[11:42] <marvin24> dpkg has a "chroot" option
[11:43] <marvin24> also make sure to fill /etc/resolv.conf
[11:44] <netchip> hmm
[11:45] <netchip> marvin24, do you know how I can get my WiFi on my phone work (a SGS3 running Ubuntu, BCM4334)?
[11:45] <netchip> just installing linux-firmware?
[11:45] <netchip> and then some conf files?
[11:47] <netchip> LMAO
[11:47] <marvin24> best is to configure it on the phone once it is installed
[11:47] <netchip> yeah
[11:47] <netchip> it's checking if it's enabled
[11:47] <netchip> if not
[11:47] <netchip> enable it

[11:55] <marvin24> oh, rootstock is depricated ...
[11:56] <marvin24> fetching some pre-build image and adjust it seems the way to go now
[12:02] <netchip> well
[12:02] <netchip> how do they generate the prebuilt image? ;-)

[20:44] <zoktar> anyone here who can help me with multirom with kexec im not sure how i install kexec to make it work. It seemed to install correctly from recovory, but loading ubuntu rom says i havnt installed kexec.
[20:45] <zoktar> owh its for the nexus 7
[20:47] <tassadar_> what exactly have you flashed in the recovery?
[20:47] <tassadar_> gimme name of that ZIP file
[20:47] <zoktar> the kexec? its the 4.2 one
[20:47] <zoktar> kernel_kexec_42.zip
[20:48] <tassadar_> okay, go to multirom menu, try to boot ubuntu  (the "you don't have kexec" message must pop out), the go to the "Misc" part and select "Copy log to /sdcard"
[20:49] <tassadar_> reboot to recovery then and "adb pull /data/media/0/multirom/error.txt"
[20:50] <zoktar> alright will that show me the error log?
[20:50] <tassadar_> it will save it to your computer, upload it to pastebin and show it to me :)
[20:50] <zoktar>  ah alright cool
[20:50] <zoktar> thanks
[23:16] <zoktar> tassadar_, seemed i hadnt installed the kernel correctly. working fine now thanks.
[23:17] <tassadar_> okay, great
