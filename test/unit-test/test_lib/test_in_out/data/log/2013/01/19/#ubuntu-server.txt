[00:11] <Bilge> Does `ping` not support ipv6?
[00:11] <sarnold> Bilge: there's a ping6 ..
[00:12] <sarnold> and ping ::1 fails where ping6 ::1 works..
[00:12] <Bilge> Just found it as you said that ;)
[00:13] <Bilge> As ipv6 becomes mainstream I hope the tools won't be so divided
[00:13] <sarnold> this division feels mighty old, feels unlikely to be healed if it isn't done by now :(
[00:13] <Bilge> ipv6 still isn't mainstream
[00:14] <Bilge> My home router only just got the firmware upgrade this month
[00:14] <Bilge> I didn't even realise it could be implemented purely with software
[00:26] <PatrickDK> heh? comcast has supported ipv6 for a year now
[00:26] <PatrickDK> all .mil and contractors are suppost to be fully ipv6 enabled
[00:26] <sarnold> PatrickDK: eh...
[00:27] <PatrickDK> I would call that pretty good support
[00:27] <PatrickDK> besides the private sector, google and everyone else
[00:27] <sarnold> PatrickDK: comcast offers tunnels to most of the customers that ask, iff the customer knows enough to ask for it :0
[00:27] <PatrickDK> sarnold, that is really old
[00:27] <PatrickDK> comcast has deployed native ipv6 to all customers for awhile now
[00:27] <sarnold> PatrickDK: also, *cough* ubuntu repos don't do ipv6 :(
[00:27] <PatrickDK> the only ones that can't yet, are those on business static ip modems
[00:28] <sarnold> PatrickDK: no kidding, time for another phone call?
[00:28] <sarnold> PatrickDK: do you have an url handy? :)
[00:28] <PatrickDK> sarnold, you have a docsis3 modem?
[00:28] <sarnold> PatrickDK: I don't recall if it is or not :(
[00:28] <PatrickDK> if it is, you should see ra's
[00:28] <PatrickDK> if not, you need to upgrade :)
[00:30] <sarnold> PatrickDK: woo. motorola.com claims the sb6120 is docsis 3.0 anyway...
[00:31] <PatrickDK> you should be seeing ra packets then
[00:31] <PatrickDK> I forget how often they come out (I'm behind a business modem :(
[00:35] <TSK> Greetings.  Does anyone here have experience with lxc (Linux Containers)?
[00:37] <TSK> I am having an issue on Ubuntu 12.04LTS whereby lxcbr0 (and other bridge devices) which should(?) auto-create/start on startup of a given container are NOT in fact creating/starting as they should and therefore the startup of any networked container fails.
[00:38] <TSK> My research on Google and on the various Ubuntu related sites turns up little information other than a couple of semi-related bugreports and passing mentions of lxcbr0 but not in any useful context.
[00:38] <sarnold> PatrickDK: hrm, my wifi router's firmware changelogs don't mention ipv6, but it's probably time to try anyhow. woo. thanks again :D
[00:39] <patdk-lap> heh, try directly connecting ubuntu into it, and tcpdump for ipv6 ra's :)
[00:40] <patdk-lap> tcpdump -n ipv6
[00:40] <sarnold> patdk-lap: good idea. :D
[00:40] <patdk-lap> oh, ip6 no v :)
[00:40] <patdk-lap> always mix that up
[00:43] <sarnold> TSK: this bug report mentions raring by name, so it might be completely different.. but give it a skim? https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1100877
[00:43] <uvirtbot> Launchpad bug 1100877 in lxc "lxc-start fails after upgrade to raring (dup-of: 1099155)" [High,New]
[00:44] <uvirtbot> Launchpad bug 1099155 in lxc "[raring] No ip assigned to bridge and no routes added for virtual networks" [Critical,Confirmed]
[00:44] <TSK> sarnold: Yes, indeed.  That's one of the bugreports I found.
[00:45] <sarnold> dang.
[00:45] <TSK> It is sadly not of any real help.  :(
=== cpg is now known as cpg|away
[00:46] <TSK> I have confirmed that containers run fine if I do not ask them to network, but that kinda defeats the usefulness of a container for me.
[00:55] <sarnold> TSK: are you using libvirt with your lxc containers? does /etc/init/libvirt-bin.conf have "lxc:///" in the "libvirt_urls"?
[01:28] <TSK> sarnold: I am actually not using libvirt at all no.  I am using the ubuntu lxc userspace tools from the repositories.
[01:30] <TSK> Is that then probably the missing bit of the equation then?  Should I be looking into libvirt-bin?
[01:46] <sarnold> TSK: meh, if the more manual way worked except for this, it's probably worth fixing. I just kinda knew about the libvirt init setting up some networking for the way I've used them.
[01:46] <sarnold> TSK: are there any log entries in /var/log/ that look remotely usfeul?
[01:47] <vhadil>  for beginner c or python . plz comment
[01:48] <sarnold> vhadil: I like C, because using it requires discipline and patience and teaches the truth about how the computer operates.
[01:48] <sarnold> vhadil: though python will give you better, more useful results, significantly faster. :)
[01:49] <sarnold> vhadil: C's security and safety problems are pretty horrible -- if you screw up, it _will_ hurt. Python will more likely drop a stack trace and no harm done...
[01:50] <sarnold> (how's that for broad overgeneralizations? :)
[01:50] <vhadil> sarnold, so what choice ?
[01:51] <sarnold> vhadil: if you choose C, start with this book: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language
[01:52] <sarnold> vhadil: if you choose python, this guide looks promising: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/intro.html
[01:53] <vhadil> sarnold, thank you friend
[01:54] <lvmer> How do you reference a file or directory ie: /share/share/test.txt   from an html page at /var/www/index.html   ?  none of my tries work: http://paste.kde.org/650768/
[01:56] <sarnold> lvmer: is /share/share in the webroot of your web server? or do you want the clients to access the file via another mechanism, such as samba?
[01:56] <vhadil> sarnold, but I am just learning myself, if I could?
[01:56] <lvmer> I think samba would be easier. /share/share is not in the webroot folder. It is a directory.
[01:57] <sarnold> lvmer: then try href="//superserver/share/share/test.txt", and be sure to use IE -- probably other browsers won't do it
[01:57] <lvmer> $$$  default mount point /var/www/index.html    & again  default mount point.... then   /share/share/test.txt
[01:57] <lvmer> o
[01:57] <lvmer> I did that one
[01:57] <sarnold> lvmer: try it with forward slashes..
[01:58] <sarnold> vhadil: sorry, I don't understand your last question
[01:58] <sarnold> lvmer: another thing to try, \\\\superserver\\share\\share\\test.txt
[02:00] <sarnold> daniel_-_: shouldn't you be asleep? :)
[02:00] <lvmer> it takes me to: http://www1.dlinksearch.com/main?url=superserver%2Fshare%2Fshare%2Ftest.txt&ref=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.40%2F&w=1672&h=915&ifc=0
[02:00] <lvmer> lol
[02:01] <sarnold> lvmer: hahahaha
[02:01] <sarnold> lvmer: does your router do something horrible like replace NX domain answers with their own advertising?
[02:01] <lvmer> hum
[02:01] <lvmer> I'm guessing that is quit possible
[02:02] <lvmer> where would I find that in the router settings?
[02:02] <lvmer> I opened it up, but idk if I see it
[02:15] <lvmer> sarnold, well we shall see what dlink support says. thanks for the headsup
[02:16] <sarnold> lvmer: so, your /share/share/test.txt -- did you get that to work yet? did IE go?
[02:17] <lvmer> no
[02:17] <sarnold> oh man :/
[02:17] <lvmer> it only works if the file is in /var/www
[02:17] <lvmer> I just got it to work by pasting in the browser: \\SUPERSERVER\Share
[02:17] <sarnold> I wonder if a security setting now prevents html from referencing unc paths
[02:19] <lvmer> it's got to be a security setting
[02:19] <lvmer> because it just times out
[02:19] <lvmer> but I can copy the address
[02:19] <lvmer> and paste it
[02:19] <lvmer> even from the html doc
[02:20] <sarnold> lvmer: hah, file://///   -- http://stackoverflow.com/a/1369164/377270
[02:20] <lvmer> ?
[02:20] <sarnold> lvmer: try file://///superserver/share/share/test.txt
[02:21] <sarnold> though that answer says firefox won't do it for security reasons
[02:23] <lvmer> it just doesn't work for security reasons
[02:23] <lvmer> lame sauce
[02:24] <lvmer> how do servers like cnet have a download button though? cause you can click that & download the file
[02:24] <lvmer> that's what I'm aiming for
[02:24] <lvmer> being able to do that with a few files that are not in the /var/www directory
[02:24] <sarnold> lvmer: they download the file over http
[02:24] <lvmer> yah
[02:24] <lvmer> no idea how to do that
[02:24] <sarnold> lvmer: you could do the same if you added another route in your server configuration to get to /share/share
[02:24] <lvmer> o
[02:25] <sarnold> in apache it'd be something vaguely like <directory /share> .. /share </directory> (can you tell it's been years since I've done apache?
[02:25] <lvmer> hah
[02:25] <sarnold> dinner now :)
[02:25] <lvmer> <directory /var/www/test.txt>
[02:25] <lvmer>                 Forcetype application/octet-stream
[02:25] <lvmer>                 Header set Content-Disposition attachment
[02:25] <lvmer>                 </directory>
[02:25] <lvmer> like this right?
[02:26] <sarnold> lvmer: oh. then try <location> ! :)
[02:26] <lvmer> sarnold, well enjoy dinner. sorry to keep you too long
[02:26] <sarnold> lvmer: not at all, not at all :) hope you get it sorted quickly :)
[02:26] <sarnold> lvmer: (the force-download behavior is something else, of course.. a new HTTP header from the server, iirc.)

[12:51] <samba35> is there any gui based syslog server there
[13:01] <frojnd> hi hi
[14:06] <bananapie> Hey, I want to recompile a ubuntu package, where can I find the parameters that were given when it was originally compiled by the ubuntu guys ?
[14:16] <RoyK> in debian/rules
[14:17] <RoyK> bananapie: that is - apt-get source 'package' and then look in the debian/rules file in the source tree
[14:18] <RoyK> or perhaps copy the whole debian dir to the new source tree and run dpkg-buldpackage
[14:18] <RoyK> dpkg-buildpackage even
[14:19] <bananapie> ok
[14:20] <bananapie> I'll try that
[14:20] <bananapie> thanks
[14:20] <RoyK> that'll build new packages
[14:20] <RoyK> easier to manage than just your average "make install"
[14:20] <bananapie> I am trying to compile asterisk from sources, but ubuntu changes the sounds directory and therefore breaks my server. So I'll try copying the debian folder
[14:21]  * RoyK dislikes asterisk rather a lot
[14:21] <bananapie> :P
[14:21] <bananapie> So do I
[14:21] <RoyK> http://karlsbakk.net/fun/asterisk-installation.wav
[14:21] <bananapie> Executed :D
[14:22] <bananapie> HAHAHA! That's a pretty awesome recording :D\
[14:22] <bananapie> Nice :D
[14:22] <bananapie> like RoyK's recording.
[14:22] <bananapie> I actually maintain a few minor patches for Asterisk because a few options are horribly broken. DTMF is pretty bad.
[14:23] <RoyK> most of asterisk is horribly broken
[14:23] <bananapie> actually, anything dahdi related is horribly broken. SIP has problems, but it isn't too bad.
[14:23] <RoyK> seems they've fixed up the rtp stack now so that it scales a bit better than back when I was working with it, though
[14:23] <bananapie> What do you use instead ?
[14:23] <RoyK> I don't work with voip anymore
[14:23] <RoyK> :P
[14:24] <bananapie> RoyK, I guess you don't want to be bald by 35 ?
[14:24] <bananapie> ( stress is a contributing factor to baldness )
[14:24]  * RoyK is > 35 and not bald ;)
[14:24] <bananapie> Probably because you stopped using asterisk ;)
[14:25] <RoyK> well, stress and baldness - I don't buy it
[14:25] <bananapie> No ?
[14:25] <RoyK> lots of other things to stress about
[14:25] <bananapie> THere are many contributing factors to baldness. Genetics, baseball caps, stress, lifestyle, food habits, exercise.
[14:25] <RoyK> anyway - some op will probably flag OFFTOPIC soon ;)
[14:25] <bananapie> It's just fun to exagerate the link between baldness and stress when talking about asterisk ;D
[14:25] <bananapie> Yes
[14:25] <bananapie> anyway, I am trying copying debian directory
[14:26] <RoyK> should work
[14:26] <RoyK> unless they've changed the code too much since last build
[14:28] <bananapie> It doesn't want to compile, I am modifying debian/rules now
[14:28] <bananapie> "dpkg-source: error: unwanted binary file: debian/.asterisk.dirs.swp" lol
[14:29] <RoyK> heh - .swp is usually vim temp files
[14:29] <bananapie> Yea, I know. I feel like a total n00b today
[14:30] <bananapie> I copied the debian from ast 1.6 to ast 1.8 source tree. I think that was a bad idea.
[14:32] <bananapie> I think I got this thing working.
[14:33] <bananapie> Ubuntu is awesome
[14:35] <bananapie> too many differences, it keeps crashing. I'll have to call configure with the proper parameters :(
[14:35] <bananapie> thanks anyway :D
[14:37] <RoyK> why do you need 1.8?
[14:37] <RoyK> I beleive uninett.no's service for universities and colleges in .no still uses 1.4 and won't change because of even more broken code in newer versions
[14:40] <RoyK> also, if you really need 1.8, there should be a ppa for it
[14:42] <RoyK> seems they've changed the versioning - latest now is 11.1.2
[14:45] <bananapie> 1.8 has a few bug fixes I needed.
[14:47] <bananapie> asterisk.conf has the directories in it, I didn't remove the ! in the line
[14:47] <bananapie> It's fun when comments affect how a configuration file is parsed unless the line starts with # :@
=== Ursinha_ is now known as Ursinha
[15:45] <qman__> oh, asterisk
[15:48] <RoyK> !language | qman__
[15:48] <ubottu> qman__: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[15:48] <qman__> haha
[15:49] <qman__> we use it at work, and I had zero experience with it until I was tasked with upgrading it
[15:49] <qman__> I knew I was in for a trip but didn't know just how bad
[15:50] <qman__> plus we've got a bunch of custom integration scripts to make it work with our ticket system
[15:50] <RoyK> I used to work for an ITSP that used asterisk
[15:51] <RoyK> that was before anyone had bothered to create a jitterbuffer
[15:51] <RoyK> we ended up hireing someone to write it and posted it to asterisk, it came in in 1.4 IIRC
[15:52] <qman__> all the dirty hacks I had to do to keep it running
[15:52] <qman__> there's a cron job that runs every minute to see if asterisk is running, and if it isn't, it restarts it
[15:52] <RoyK> digium posted that jitterbuffer wasn't a priority, since asterisk didn't need one
[15:53] <qman__> because it just dies at random
[15:53] <RoyK> hehe
[15:53] <qman__> that worked ok, but then it would start using 100% CPU
[15:53] <qman__> so now it also checks to see if it's going out of control over 30 seconds
[15:53] <RoyK> and then, gdb asterisk core - bt full
[15:53] <qman__> and if it is, it kills it and restarts it
[15:53] <RoyK> post a bug report and wait for a nofix
[15:54] <RoyK> or wontfix
[15:54] <qman__> I've actually got it to a somewhat tolerable state now
[15:55] <qman__> they had it running with dahdi on a P4 xeon server with hyperthreading
[15:55] <qman__> which was causing tons of interrupts and breaking everything
[15:55] <RoyK> I had to dig into the source to fix a few things
[15:56] <RoyK> like taking a bath in a septic tank, somehow
[15:57] <qman__> now we've got it all sip and in the datacenter
[15:57] <qman__> remaining problems are bandwidth related, specifically because it's behind an ASUS router
[15:58] <RoyK> hopefully not much nat?
[15:58] <qman__> NAT, openVPN concatenator
[15:59] <patdk-lap> yuk
[15:59] <qman__> trying to convince the boss that these consumer grade routers with dd-wrt can't handle the load is not easy
[16:00] <patdk-lap> just toss them out and use a normal server
[16:00] <patdk-lap> I mean, even an old p3 with 1gigs ram would make a killing firewall
[16:00] <qman__> they work fine for small shobs
[16:00] <qman__> shops*
[16:00] <qman__> but not for our datacenter, not for site to site VPNs
[16:00] <patdk-lap> oh, heh
[16:01] <patdk-lap> using dd-wrt at a datacenter?
[16:01] <RoyK> sounds a bit "sub-optimal" ;)
[16:01] <qman__> we need real hardware for that, whether it's a cisco, or even just a full on server configured to be a router
[16:02] <patdk-lap> I kept maxing out the small consumer routers, not enough cpu for any real compression support for the vpn
[16:02] <qman__> we're doing SIP with about 40 phones connecting to it through one dd-wrt router
[16:02] <qman__> so every day when the call volume goes up, we get weird issues with calls dropping or sound not working
[16:03] <qman__> because that router just can't handle that many packets per second
[16:03] <RoyK> heh - we have a rather expensive ($100k?) cisco router at work, it maxed out recently on ipv6 traffic - didn't switch ipv6 in hardware, but pushed it all to the cpu
[16:04] <qman__> but because it doesn't drive up the memory use or CPU load above 1.0, the boss can't see it
[16:04] <RoyK> not very new, though
[16:04] <qman__> it takes more than CPU to handle packets
[16:04] <patdk-lap> it shouldn't take any cpu to handle packets, on real hardware
[16:05] <RoyK> sure, but everything else works, just not loads of ipv6, since it tends to do all that in software
[16:05] <qman__> we use ASUS RT16N routers
[16:05] <qman__> which, for a consumer router, is very good
[16:05] <patdk-lap> that isn't a real router :)
[16:05] <qman__> but it's still a consumer router
[16:05] <patdk-lap> in cisco, the only thing that hits cpu, is rare, like new featuresets in royk's case
[16:06] <patdk-lap> I had the same issue, <2% cisco router cpu, enabled vlans, and it went to way >100%
[16:06] <patdk-lap> found out the same deal, vlans where cpu processed on mine
[16:06] <RoyK> any good router does the real things in ASICs (or FPGAs)
[16:06] <qman__> yeah
[16:07] <RoyK> seems FPGAs are getting more popular
[16:07] <RoyK> which is good
[16:07] <patdk-lap> hmm, fpga is just a case type
[16:07] <RoyK> hm?
[16:07] <patdk-lap> full pin grid array
[16:07] <RoyK> an FPGA can be recoded
[16:07] <RoyK> an ASIC cannot
[16:08] <patdk-lap> oh, fieldprogrammable gate array :)
[16:08] <patdk-lap> too many different names for that :)
[16:08] <RoyK> yes :)
[16:09] <RoyK> seems Juniper is moving to FPAGs for their high-end products
[16:11] <patdk-lap> if tcam could come down in price
[16:11] <patdk-lap> could make cheap consumer routers worth something
[16:12] <RoyK> tcam?
[16:12] <patdk-lap> it's what cisco uses
[16:12] <patdk-lap> that is what is *offloaded from cpu* normaly means
[16:12] <patdk-lap> there is enough tcam or cam ram to not bother the cpu about it
[16:12] <patdk-lap> http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/netsysm/article.php/3527301/On-Your-Network-What-the-Heck-is-a-TCAM.htm
[16:13] <patdk-lap> kind of like a hash lookup
[16:13] <patdk-lap> like store all mac addresses in it, so a switch knows instantly what port it need to go out on
[16:14] <patdk-lap> or store the routing table in the case of a router
[16:16] <RoyK> I just started working with juniper systems
[16:16] <RoyK> it's joy!
[16:16] <RoyK> no longer a dumb OS requiring all sorts of tweaks, but a full BSD OS for management
[16:17] <frojnd> I have 2 ips. And I've configured dnss for only one IP. Yet nginx when I go to second IP (I dont write IP address) it writes default nginx page. Any ideas how can I disable nginx to show content for that second IP addrss?
[16:18]  * RoyK guesses that question is better answered in #nginx
[16:19] <qman__> frojnd, your site is listening on * or 0.0.0.0; I don't know where or how to change that in nginx, but that's what's happening
[16:19] <qman__> in apache you change the virtualhost statement
[17:11] <RoyK> patdk-lap: any idea what there is to choose from on high-end routers/switches these days? cisco/juniper? perhaps HP?
[17:11] <patdk-lap> hp doesn't make any  Iknow of, just switchs
[17:12] <RoyK> any others?
[17:12] <patdk-lap> but I'm heavy into cisco world
[17:12] <patdk-lap> hmm, there is
[17:13] <patdk-lap> hmm, can't think of it
[17:13] <patdk-lap> someone keeps harping about it to me though
[17:13] <patdk-lap> I mainly ignore cause not looking to change anything currently
[17:13] <patdk-lap> foundry?
[17:15] <RoyK> seems they were bought by Brocade in 2008
[17:15] <patdk-lap> ya
[17:15] <RoyK> and Nortel bankrupted just after that
[17:15] <patdk-lap> probably why I kept thinking brocade :)
[17:16] <patdk-lap> I've never liked brocade, just their sales seems shady to me
[17:16] <patdk-lap> no real issue with their products
[17:17] <RoyK> I've only worked slightly with their FC switches, some 10 years back
[17:19] <patdk-lap> I guess a new aplha or beta is coming out
[17:20] <patdk-lap> build servers been backed up like hell the last few days
[17:42] <frojnd> qman__: thanx I'll ask in nginx
[17:57] <RoyK> hrmf
[17:57] <RoyK> any idea what this means?
[17:57] <RoyK> [1720778.526707] Buffer I/O error on device dm-8, logical block 26214384
[17:58] <escott> RoyK, what is backing dm-8?
[17:58] <RoyK> a raid-6 which is whelthy
[17:59] <escott> RoyK, mdadm raid or hardware raid
[17:59] <RoyK> seems some lvm snapshotting caused the error
[17:59] <RoyK> mdadm
[17:59] <RoyK> just testing lvm snapshotting for performance, and created the snapshots a wee bit too small
[18:00] <RoyK> lvm snapshotting is, well, "sub-optimal" in its design :þ
[18:01] <RoyK> I've used snapshotting on zfs earlier, and going back to trying to use snapshotting on lvm is like going back to the eightees or something
[18:03] <PatrickDK> well, lvm isn't cow
[18:03] <PatrickDK> and I think it still uses like a4mb window
[18:10] <RoyK> I know
[18:10] <RoyK> some patches have come lately to make it cow, but I don't know when they'll be accepted
[18:11] <escott> RoyK, cow at the block level seems weird to me
[18:11] <RoyK> escott: it works with zfs
[18:11] <RoyK> zvols are cow
[18:11] <RoyK> works with other storage systems as well
[18:11] <escott> RoyK, but ZFS knows what blocks are structure blocks and what are data. i guess i shouldnt say block when i mean below the filesystem level
[18:12] <RoyK> a zvol isn't a filesystem
[18:15] <RoyK> it's just something onto which you place a filesystem, or export over iscsi or fc
[19:59] <gmachine_24> Hi. This might be a rookie question - but for an NAS, what are the advantages of running ubuntu server instead of just the standard version? Thanks.
