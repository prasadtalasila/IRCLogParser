[05:52] <sim590> I'm presently trying to trigger a script after I press the power button on my TF101.. I know the button's keycode from running "xev".. All I need is to know what what to put in the place of <trigger script> in xmodmap -e "keycode 142 = <trigger script>"
[05:52] <sim590> anyone's got an idea?
[05:53] <sim590> keycode is 124, by the way.. I inverted 2 numbers

[07:17] <dholbach> good morning
[08:47] <dholbach> ogra_, janimo: do you think it'd make sense to do something ARM- or enablement-specific for UDW? we still have 3 open 30m slots: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek/Timetable
[08:47] <janimo> dholbach, TBH the last ARM sessions did not seem very successful :)
[08:48] <janimo> either too techniocal or lack of hw makes people shy I guess
[08:48] <dholbach> hrm
[08:48]  * janimo checks the session names
[08:50] <dholbach> maybe it'd help to advertise it in ARM/mobile specific lists and so on
[08:57] <janimo> we only have ubuntu-devel as a ml AFAIK?
[08:57] <janimo> or you mean outside ubuntu?
[09:00] <dholbach> wherever ARM/Ubuntu people hang out :)
[09:04] <janimo> dholbach, this is the only dedicated channel, the mailing list is ubuntu-devel as it pertains to ubuntu as a whole
[09:04] <dholbach> ok
[09:04] <janimo> I am just not sure what ARM specific thing we could disucss because it would either be too technical
[09:05] <janimo> or if not, than not ARM specific
[09:05] <janimo> anything that is different on ARM should be low level details of plumbing and kernel which few people know or care about
[09:09] <dholbach> I just wondered if it might be interesting to talk about how in general ubuntu is brought to a new device and everything is enabled, images made and so on - I mean you are the experts - there's a lot people don't know about what you do :)
[09:09] <janimo> that is true, cdimage people like ogra and infinity know most about making images
[09:10] <janimo> would be a nice session to hold if we had easy to use tools to roll your own image
[09:10] <janimo> but there is none, besides scripting together debotstraap or live-build and which makes it error prone
[09:11] <dholbach> or maybe an overview over what the arm/mobile/device people do - just a description of the work that goes into it - there's a huge variety of things and it might be interesting to learn more about what's going on behind the scenes
[09:11] <dholbach> (as an idea...) :)
[09:11] <janimo> I am mostly thinking about what session could we have that people walk away from with info they can apply
[09:11] <janimo> rather than just finding out trivia about ubuntu development :)
[09:12] <janimo> or at least that is what my impression was about the goals of open weeks, maybe I misunderstood partly :)
[09:12] <janimo> oh by the way, happy birthday
[09:12]  * janimo hugs dholbach
[09:13] <dholbach> thanks a lot janimo :)
[09:13] <dholbach> well what you do HAS to do with development :)
[09:16] <janimo> it is development sure, I am just thinking it is nowhere near as readily described and copied/applied as a topic on packaging for example
[09:16] <dholbach> sure, but you always have that - some sessions are hands-on, clear-cut, others are an introduction to what a team is doing which might generate more interest
[09:16] <janimo> I wonder why no QML/phone SDK sessions there though
[09:17] <janimo> I am just basing my belief on the ARM FTBFS session I gave last year where I think only you asked a question to break the awkward silence :)
[09:47] <dholbach> janimo, I just thought that with all the great stuff coming up regarding Ubuntu on ARM there must be a story we can tell
[09:47] <dholbach> at least one
[09:47] <dholbach> :)

[10:29] <ogra_> dholbach, putr me in, i'll make something up about image building (and re-packing the nx7 image)
[10:30] <dholbach> ogra_, 30m? 1h? Thu 31st Jan - 17:30 UTC?
[10:31] <ogra_> 30m for a "talk" plus 30 for Q&A ?
[10:31] <janimo> ogra saves the ARM team's honor again. \o/
[10:31] <ogra_> not sure i can fill the second half
[10:31] <ogra_> heh
[10:32]  * ogra_ goes afk to shovel a ton of snow ... *sigh*
[10:37] <dholbach> ogra_, thanks a bunch! I'll put you in there
[11:18] <reisei> ogra_: what type of rootfs image for nexus7 ? squashfs?
[11:21] <janimo> reisei, ext4 last time I installed
[11:22] <janimo> it is not a live image but a form of preinstalled - last  I checked at least

[15:58] <focus_well> Anyone know if there is ubuntu distro available for IMX6Q Sabrelite board?
[15:59] <ogra_> focus_well, iirc linaro has ubuntu images for it, ask in #linaro
[16:02] <focus_well> ogra_: that was my first destination but they say they discontinue it and there are no distros to download from their Sabrelite web site https://wiki.linaro.org/Boards/MX6QSabreLite
[16:03] <ogra_> ah, well, we never had an mx6 image in ubuntu
[16:03] <ogra_> there were mx5 ones but they  wont run on mx6
[16:04] <focus_well> I am hoping to make something from sources for mx6 - are there going to be big problems (not expert at this)?
[16:05] <focus_well> pardon my ignorance, can the sources for mx5 be worked on to make it work on mx6?
[16:06] <focus_well> or is it down to lack of documentation that keeps mx6 from a decent ubuntu supported CPU?
[16:07] <focus_well> The iMX6Q (quad core) has come down in price to about $20 - opens up a lo of possibilities.
[16:08] <ogra_> mx5 cant be made to work on mx6
[16:08] <ogra_> well, the images cant, you will need a different u-boot and kernel
[16:09] <focus_well> ogra_: Ah! So its just documentation and compiling to march mx5 into mx6?
[16:09] <ogra_> i know ppisati looked into addint devicetree support for mx6 to our current raring kernel, not sure where he got his image from exactly
[16:09] <ogra_> (for the userspace)
[16:12] <focus_well> Saberlite did come with some sort of Linux, so if I got hold of the sources for that, I'd be able to compare and work out what to do?
[16:12] <Tassadar> quad core for $20? that is crazy Oo
[16:13] <ogra_> focus_well, indeed, yes
[16:13] <ogra_> you could also make something up on top of ubuntu-core if you are experienced
[16:13] <focus_well> Tassadar: http://uk.farnell.com/freescale-semiconductor/mcimx6q5eym10ac/mpu-i-mx6-quad-1ghz-624fcbga/dp/2253171
[16:13] <ogra_> the sabre is an awesome board
[16:14] <ogra_> and ++ for actual SATA
[16:14] <Tassadar> oh, I thought you meant  the whole board
[16:15] <focus_well> ogra_: I am in the game to make an open source KiCAD SO-DIMM board with the iMX6Q and release it free of charge
[16:15] <hrw> ogra_: I would say -- for freescale
[16:16] <hrw> I have a feeling that freescale produces cpus and do not care at all about supporting them
[16:16] <ogra_> depends how you define support
[16:17] <ogra_> if your definition is release a half finished BSP and move on to the next project, then they actually do support it :P
[16:18] <focus_well> ogra_: so its possible to just copy the circuit of the Sabrelite which is available online - chop unecessary bits (just have micro SD to boot + RAM + minimal bits) and then make the rest of the pins available out through the 200 pin SO-DIMM edge connector + fpc connectors.
[16:18] <hrw> ogra_: ;DD
[16:18] <hrw> ogra_: that's their definition indeed
[16:18] <ogra_> :)
[16:19] <focus_well> Tassadar: Sorry I meant chip price is $20 for quad core. Dual and single core chips probably a lot cheaper
[16:20] <focus_well> I already try to start project with AllWinner A10 CPU - but their lack of documentation is putting the whole thing through sticky syrup
[16:20] <hrw> focus_well: who cares about single/dual when quad is 20$?
[16:20] <focus_well> Now that the quad core is $20, I'm thinking the AllWinner at $10 is not competitive
[16:21] <ogra_> hrw, makes of industrial stuff probably
[16:21] <ogra_> *makers
[16:21] <focus_well> So if I make a SO-DIMM board, with quad core, and release all the circuit diagrams in KiCAD which is free for anyone to use, they can make their variants and sell it or whatever
[16:21] <ogra_> if your 600MHz beagle B1 like chip is capable enough you wont use any dual core solution
[16:21] <focus_well> But I need Ubuntu ported to it. What are my realistic prospects?
[16:22] <ogra_> for running some sensors in your factory or whatever
[16:22] <ogra_> focus_well, well, userspace will just run OOTB
[16:22] <ogra_> you need to make up the kernel and bootloader bits for it though
[16:23] <focus_well> I wanted to have a proper tablet like computer with a speech and touch LCD with lots of GPIO pins and completely working open sourced KiCAD drawings and PCB so that anyone can go make product with it free of charge.
[16:24] <Tassadar> Is like an actuall datasheet available for that processor?
[16:25] <focus_well> I plan to port Gambas IDE so a Visual basic like software runs on the CPU + espeak - so the thing doesn't need any buttons - it accepts inputs from buttons designed on Gambas programs, and output is visual + voice
[16:26] <ogra_> intresting project
[16:26] <Tassadar> focus_well: that seems like a pretty expensive thing to build
[16:26] <focus_well> I already do all that work in software for cheap A10 matchbox computer  - http://www.gplsquared.com/mk802/mk802.html
[16:26] <focus_well> I got stuck trying to get sources for all that Linux and datasheets for the A10.
[16:26] <focus_well> Dragging on 6 months
[16:27] <ogra_> A10 is crap
[16:27]  * ogra_ isnt a fan ... 
[16:27] <focus_well> These days the CPU + display + RAM etc under $30 BOM costs
[16:28] <wookey> surely it's better than the Pi chip?
[16:28] <Tassadar> even the touchscreens? Oo
[16:28] <wookey> which is the competition in that price bracket
[16:28] <ogra_> wookey, my ipaq is better than the Pi chip :P
[16:28] <focus_well> Touch screen $7 for 4.3" - $13 for 7"
[16:29]  * Tassadar is looking at the pi which is quetly sitting on his router, working as a dlna server
[16:29] <Tassadar> wau, that is quite low Oo
[16:29] <Tassadar> hmm
[16:30] <focus_well> Tassadar: CN factory prices - need to order 1000+ usually to get prices like that
[16:31] <Tassadar> that CPU can't be soldered by hand, you need board made in factory...that kinda limits the "everyone can make one"
[16:32] <focus_well> So if I commit to make an iMX6Q board, is there a good chance by the end of the year I can get the software working?
[16:32] <ogra_> well, as i said, the userspace should work OOTB
[16:33] <ogra_> depends how well you can work out bootloader and kernel for your device
[16:33] <focus_well> Tassadar: just need a reflow oven - about $600 or less
[16:33] <focus_well> ogra_: What does 00TB mean?
[16:33] <ogra_> out of the box
[16:34] <ogra_> ubuntu userspace will run on pretty much every armv7 SoC
[16:34] <focus_well> Ah! I get it - so all I need is command line to be working on the board and the rest is just userspace?!?!?!?
[16:34] <ogra_> no, you need a kernel and a bootloader that work
[16:34] <wookey> comand-line _is_ userspace -)
[16:34] <Kuschelwolle> Herzlich Willkommen in der Freiheit! Kein Kick Kein Ban nur Fun! lg Lukas #ubuntu-de-offtopiic
[16:34] <focus_well> OK
[16:35] <ogra_> the bootloader boots, loads the kernel, the kernel gets executed and then mounts the root filesystem which contains the usersapce
[16:35] <ogra_> the last bit here will just work
[16:35] <focus_well> OK
[16:35] <ogra_> everything before the mounting needs to come from you (or someone)
[16:36] <focus_well> OK - the boot loader - might be able to rework this - http://www.eewiki.net/display/linuxonarm/i.MX6x+SABRE+Lite
[16:37] <focus_well> Compiling and getting the kernel to work will then be the hardest of the hardest part - I can spend months on it if that is what it takes
[16:42] <focus_well> Thanks guys for the chat.
