[01:40] <Bilge-> How do I get a package out of stuck state?
[01:40] <Bilge-> apt-get always shows "1 not fully installed or removed."
[01:40] <Bilge-> I don't want to remove it but the post-install script always fails
[01:41] <Bilge-> It always throws "FATAL: Could not load /lib/modules/3.2.13-grsec-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64/modules.dep: No such file or directory"
[01:42] <sarnold> Bilge-: iirc, something like "sudo depmod -a 3.2.13-grsec-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64"
[01:43] <sarnold> (whatever uname -r will report for the kernel version for that kernel, once it boots)
[01:45] <Bilge-> It just gives the same errors
[01:45] <Bilge-> WARNING: Couldn't open directory /lib/modules/3.2.13-grsec-xxxx-grs-ipv6-64: No such file or directory
[01:45] <Bilge-> Am I supposed to create this directory by hand?
[01:45] <sarnold> whatever package contains that kernel is supposed to create the directory
[01:47] <Bilge-> No package, it was installed by the provider
[01:48] <Bilge-> It's still erroring, just with a different error now :/
[01:48] <Bilge-> dpkg: error processing iptables-persistent (--configure):
[01:48] <Bilge-> This is a really buggy package
[01:49] <sarnold> it probably assumes a functioning kernel install.
[01:49] <Bilge-> No other package on the system has had any issues
[01:49] <Bilge-> And I've installed half of apt
[01:50] <sarnold> Bilge-: you may wish to install the kernel-package package and use the make-kpkg utility to build kernel packages if you're going to run your own kernels -- it helps smooth over a lot of the mistakes people may make when installing their own kernels
[01:53] <Bilge-> I'd rather just install a fixed version of iptables-persistent
[01:53] <Bilge-> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/iptables-persistent/+bug/1002078
[01:53] <uvirtbot> Launchpad bug 1002078 in iptables-persistent "iptables-persistent fails to install if module iptable_filter is not available" [Undecided,Fix released]
[01:54] <Bilge-> According to this it was fixed in 0.5.6ubuntu1
[01:54] <Bilge-> But I have 0.5.3ubuntu2
[01:54] <Bilge-> How do I get the fixed one?
[01:56] <sarnold> 0.5.6ubuntu1 is in 12.10; 0.5.3ubuntu2 is in 12.04 LTS. If you want to remain on 12.04 LTS and still have that fix, it might be worth asking in the bug report if an SRU is appropriate https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates
[01:58] <Bilge-> I will do that
[01:58] <Bilge-> How can you see which version of Ubuntu has which package version?
[02:00] <sarnold> Bilge-: perhaps the easiest is e.g. http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=iptables-persistent
[02:00] <sarnold> bleck. that's not the URL I typed.
[02:01] <sarnold> Bilge-: http://packages.ubuntu.com/package-name
[02:01] <Bilge-> Thanks ;)
[02:10] <kimsia> i am having some problems running pecl install perl. the details of my attempts are documented at http://askubuntu.com/q/245996/10591
[02:13] <Bilge-> What I really can't understand is that I have this exact same installation on another box but it didn't have these problems or errors
[02:13] <Bilge-> Same hardware, same distro, same packages
[02:14] <Bilge-> Same kernel too

[02:53] <aldo_raine> hi guys.. is it possible to put ubuntu-server on raspberry micro-computers?

[04:44] <codepython777> anyone using pdns?
[05:10] <sarnold> codepython777: powerdns is in universe, you can install pdns-server or pdns-recursor, as you need
[05:32] <codepython777> sarnold: seems like its lagging behind the source version
[05:32] <codepython777> sarnold: do you use it?
[05:33] <codepython777> sarnold: http://cmeerw.org/debian/ -- isnt he the maintaner for pdns on deb/ubuntu?
[05:34] <sarnold> codepython777: that is common, the version released with a distro is typically held steady and updated primarily for security problems
[05:34] <sarnold> codepython777: that way updates are less likely to break deployed systems
[05:36] <sarnold> codepython777: I don't see 'meer' in 'apt-get changelog pdns-server' -- that doesn't show that he isn't involved, but it isn't conclusive proof...

[09:03] <adamlis> what should I google for to get the results I which? seems no1 is netbooting windows 7 off ubuntu server
[09:04] <cfhowlett> adamlis, why that is just ... shocking!
[09:05] <adamlis> agreed!
[09:05] <adamlis> netboot and pxe installs should be way more widely used
[09:32] <adamlis> There's so many guides on how to PXE-Boot Linux Distros but none on how to boot Windows from PXE
[09:32] <adamlis> I don't know where to turn and Google won't help me because I don't know what to search for. I get 1000 results of linux installations
[09:33] <cfhowlett> adamlis, ask in ##windows or #windows
[09:33] <cfhowlett> adamlis, it really is not an ubuntu issue, is it?
[09:34] <adamlis> I thought so .. the ubuntu-server needs to be configured to handle windows dists.. but thanks for pointing me to the right channel, I missunderstood the topic here

[12:52] <Akendo> Hello, just some simple question. Will be there a  release for 2012.2.1? Current Version is 2012.2. (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ServerTeam/CloudArchive)
[12:55] <jamespage> Akendo, yes there will be - its stuck in -proposed for both the CA and for quantal at the moment
[12:55] <jamespage> Akendo, trying to get it nudged along this week
[12:55] <jamespage> Akendo, you might find this report useful - http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/ubuntu-server/cloud-archive/folsom_versions.html
[12:56] <Akendo> Hi jamespage, Thank you very much. Is there any resource I consider for such kind of information?
[12:56] <jamespage> Akendo, for the cloud archive that report :-)
[12:56] <Akendo> Great, that makes me happy. jamespage you think this will be release end of this week?
[12:57] <Akendo> or later on?
[12:58] <jamespage> Akendo, poking now
[12:59] <jamespage> Akendo, as in poking to find out why its blocked
[12:59] <jamespage> Akendo, all the bits a pieces for verification have been done :-)
[12:59] <Akendo> <3
[12:59] <Akendo> Can I help you :D ?
[13:00] <jamespage> Akendo, well running the packages from the -proposed pocket of the cloud-archive and commenting on that bug that it all looks OK would support the case to releasing 2012.2.1 to -updates
[13:01] <jamespage> Akendo, we don't release to the CA -updates pocket until it gets released into the quantal -updates pocket if that makes sense
[13:02] <jamespage> Akendo, sorry for the lag - we'll try to get the next set of updates through quicker

[13:31] <MraAlbertina> Hi. I would like to be clarified on 2 matters and if you please help me understand it; 1- when doing a fresh installation from mini.iso is it really necessary to install(/select on tasksel) "Basic Ubuntu Sever"  -  or the system will download and install any needed files/packages when something is installed, like LAMP, for instance? (the 2nd doubt is in standby : )
[13:35] <andol> MraAlbertina: Whenever you have apt alt tasksel install something for you it will always make sure that all dependencies are satisfied.
=== Ursinha is now known as Ursinha-afk
[13:37] <MraAlbertina> andol: thank you. i asked because i see a couple packages in it i will never use, like vim, for example, i prefer nano.
[13:37] <MraAlbertina> (i know i know, we always could remove it later... but... just in case
[13:39] <MraAlbertina> The second doubt. If i recall right, abourt v 11.10, webmin were not recommended anymore. Now i see a lot of users ... using it. Is there any system danger in installing LAMP trough a script Usermin has, that installs it - for the sake of some gui to manage virtual hosts?

[19:13] <Cortez> why do netstat and nmap always show diffirent ports open?
[19:15] <rbasak> hallyn: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1586766/
[19:15] <sarnold> Cortez: netstat shows what the machine knows -- all ports open on all IPs. nmap can only find what is visible on external interfaces, and firewalls between hosts can block or redirect as they see fit.
[19:16] <RoyK> Cortez: what's the diff?
[19:17] <Cortez> sarnold: thnx.

[19:18] <Cortez> i did a who is on one of the IPs and it said Novalogic, the classic game maker....on my new installed server...
[19:18] <RoyK> Cortez: netstat -an (or similar) will also show active connections - you'll want -ln to show what's listening

[19:31] <hallyn> rbasak: interesting.  i'm actually guessing it'll do better under quantal, but that's enough info - thanks!
[19:31] <rbasak> hallyn: I can try quantal easily enough. One command and twenty minutes :)
[19:32] <hallyn> rbasak: cool, let's try
[19:32] <sarnold> rbasak,hallyn, I can test quantal way faster..
[19:33] <Cortez> guys, one last question :D   if i disable ufw it will allow all ports? Im trying to connect to a service and what ever i do they cant reach each other
[19:33] <hallyn> sarnold: on arm?
[19:33] <sarnold> hallyn: yes
[19:33] <RoyK> hm... lsof shows port 40126/tcp open, but fuser can't find it - any idea?
[19:33] <hallyn> sarnold: please do :)  just wondering whether kvm on arm (which was qemu-system-x86_64) every worked
[19:34] <sarnold> hallyn: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1586820/
[19:34] <RoyK> sarnold: what arm platform?
[19:34] <Cortez> becouse even when i disable ufw they can still not communicate... so I can assume the block is some where not on my server?
[19:34] <sarnold> RoyK: pandaboard
[19:35] <hallyn> sarnold: so kvm worked!
[19:35] <hallyn> sarnold: thanks
[19:35] <RoyK> sarnold: iirc that uses a cortex9, which doesn't support virtualisation in the cpu
[19:35] <sarnold> hallyn: yw :)
[19:35] <RoyK> sarnold: so you'll have to do it in the os, which is no fun
[19:36] <sarnold> RoyK: heh, yeah, I was surprised hallyn had asked :) it didn't seem like it'd be fun on a panda. cute and small and low power, yes, but fast enough for virtualizing? dunno.. :)
[19:36] <RoyK> sarnold: I tried briefly on my panda, but it wasn't too good
[19:36] <RoyK> better wait for the next generation with a15
[19:36] <sarnold> RoyK: haha :)
[19:37] <RoyK> new phones come with a15, which is fun, if we can get kvm into cyanogenmod ;)

[21:44] <marshall> hey ubuntu-server
[21:45] <marshall> how do I know if port 443 is open to my remote server? I've tried telnet-ing and it gives me connection refused, but might that be because there are no processes listening on that port?
[21:45] <Akendo> Hi marshall
[21:45] <Akendo> are you running SSL on this port?
[21:46] <marshall> I'd like to use HTTPS on this port, but I don't believe I am, yet
[21:46] <Akendo> A connection refuse indicates that there is no opend port
[21:46] <Akendo> When you're connected on the Server, check with netstat -tplan |"\:443"
[21:47] <sarnold> .. missing a 'grep' :)
[21:47] <Akendo> Thanks :D
[21:47] <marshall> when i telnet a random port, it just hangs forever
[21:47] <Akendo> I want to tab so hard here ~.~
[21:48] <sarnold> marshall: that's a firewall that's been configured to DROP packets rather than REJECT packets. it's a bit rude but quite common.
[21:48] <marshall> mmhmm
[21:48] <adam_g> zul: Daviey this look okay to go into folsom-staging? http://people.canonical.com/~agandelman/folsom/libvirt-0.9.13-0ubuntu12.2~cloud0/
[21:48] <marshall> yeah, pretty sure amazon does the same thing with it's ec2
[21:48] <marshall> just drops packets on unopened ports
[21:49] <marshall> so do you think the firewall might be set to reject packets on 443?
[21:50] <sarnold> marshall: or, the firewall is configured to allow it, but there is no program listening on that port
[21:50] <marshall> sarnold: ok
[22:11] <kevinmthomas> hi everyone, I am running ubuntu-server and I installed cups
[22:11] <kevinmthomas> and i cant seem to print

[22:12] <kevinmthomas> but i cant set it up on the server
[22:13] <_Andrei_> hey
[22:13] <kevinmthomas> hi

[22:15] <kevinmthomas> hi nantou i wasasking andrei about getting my network printer working
[22:15] <_Andrei_> if you're looking for good docs, have a look at the ArchLinux wiki (i know, i'ts not ubuntu)
[22:15] <kevinmthomas> well
[22:15] <_Andrei_> but all linux distros are using the same services
[22:16] <kevinmthomas> oh
[22:16] <_Andrei_> your ubuntu server is for personal use, or a hosting server ?
[22:16] <kevinmthomas> so you cant walk me through how to do it here
[22:16] <kevinmthomas> well its hosting server
[22:16] <_Andrei_> ok
[22:16] <kevinmthomas> so i installed cups
[22:17] <_Andrei_> and what you whant to print
[22:17] <kevinmthomas> for example
[22:17] <kevinmthomas> when i type lp ttxt.txt
[22:17] <kevinmthomas> id like it to print to the printer
[22:17] <kevinmthomas> from a command line
[22:17] <kevinmthomas> my network printer is at 192.168.1.50
[22:18] <kevinmthomas> i have been trying for hours
[22:18] <kevinmthomas> no luck
[22:18] <usr13> kevinmthomas: Point your browser to localhost:631
[22:18] <usr13> kevinmthomas: Set as server default
[22:19] <kevinmthomas> ok
[22:19] <kevinmthomas> how do i do that exactly
[22:19] <kevinmthomas> i have another shell open
[22:19] <sarnold> kevinmthomas: perhaps this will help? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu
[22:19] <usr13> lynx
[22:20] <kevinmthomas> that help.ubuntu doesnt work for server
[22:20] <nantou> kevinmthomas, i cannot help you, im too much wrapped into other things
[22:20] <kevinmthomas> its graphical for the desktp version
[22:20] <nantou> sporry
[22:20] <kevinmthomas> usr13 - how do i set as server default
[22:20] <kevinmthomas> its ok nantou
[22:21] <usr13> under Administration
[22:22] <kevinmthomas> ok in the cupsd.conf?
[22:23] <kevinmthomas> i dont see an administration i see a #only listen for connections from teh local machine
[22:23] <kevinmthomas> Listen localhost:631
[22:24] <usr13> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587253/  #Example
[22:25] <kevinmthomas> ok
[22:25] <kevinmthomas> should i copy that and past that to my cups directory?
[22:27] <kevinmthomas> ok i did the cups restart
[22:27] <kevinmthomas> with the new file
[22:28] <kevinmthomas> how do i test?
[22:28] <usr13> lpq
[22:28] <kevinmthomas> lpstat -p shows no destinations added
[22:28] <kevinmthomas> lpq - no default destination available
[22:29] <kevinmthomas> both give errors
[22:30] <kevinmthomas> when i go into the web i can go into the printer
[22:30] <kevinmthomas> http://192.168.1.50
[22:30] <kevinmthomas> loads it
[22:31] <kevinmthomas> however when i go to http://192.168.1.122:631 pages doesnt connect
[22:31] <kevinmthomas> .122 is the ubuntu server
[22:31] <kevinmthomas> .50 is the printer
[22:33] <kevinmthomas> however when i telnet to 192.168.1.50
[22:33] <kevinmthomas> i get a menu to edit the printer

[22:40] <kevinmthomas> im in the localhost:631

[22:40] <kevinmthomas> there is no MyPrinter

[23:45] <Chriys> Hi guys. My ISP is blocking the port 25 do you know if there is a way to verify if the port 465 is open and then how to config postfix to send email throught that port
[23:46] <TheLordOfTime> Chriys, are you on a residential ISP?
[23:46] <Chriys> yes
[23:46] <TheLordOfTime> they'll probably block 465 too
[23:46] <TheLordOfTime> and most mail-sending ports, unless you use a horridly oddball one
[23:47] <Chriys> -_-' crap
[23:47] <qman__> and you'll be on mail blacklists by default, since you're on a residential DHCP range
[23:47] <qman__> you need to relay through a real mail host
[23:48] <Chriys> what about if i have my own domain let say example.com
[23:48] <qman__> whether that's setting up a gmail account for that purpose, or renting a VPS is up to you
[23:49] <TheLordOfTime> yup
[23:49] <TheLordOfTime> Chriys, irrelevant
[23:49] <TheLordOfTime> Chriys, the DNSBLs check the IP
[23:49] <qman__> or getting a business internet with a static IP, or a dedicated server, or a shared web host, or any of the many other ways to get online
[23:49] <TheLordOfTime> not the hostname
[23:49] <TheLordOfTime> if you get business class with static IP it'll probably work
[23:49] <TheLordOfTime> otherwise use an SMTP relay somewhere else through a real mail host
[23:49] <TheLordOfTime> something that can actually rpocess your email (like google via a google apps account)
[23:49] <Chriys> yeah your are right.
[23:50] <TheLordOfTime> i use google apps for my domains' stuff
[23:50] <TheLordOfTime> one google apps account, multiple domains.
[23:50] <TheLordOfTime> </epicstatus>
[23:50] <TheLordOfTime> but i digress - that's because I CBA to go configure a mailserver
[23:50] <Chriys> ok but do you know a ways to send from the my online store located on my server ?
[23:50] <qman__> I run my own but the spam is terrible
[23:51] <TheLordOfTime> Chriys, use a backend for your store that can use SMTP?
[23:51] <TheLordOfTime> and by backend i should probably say site/store framework'
[23:51] <TheLordOfTime> rather than backend
[23:51] <qman__> you can tell your server to relay the mail through a real mail host
[23:51] <qman__> you can provide mail for your LAN that way, too
[23:51] <qman__> but you need a mail host
[23:51] <TheLordOfTime> indeed
[23:52] <Chriys> oohh this one can be great. Do you have a link on how to do that ?
[23:52] <qman__> before I had a job, I set it up using a gmail account
[23:52] <qman__> the downside to that is it all comes from that gmail account
[23:54] <Chriys> ok i see but do you have a step by step tutorial on how to relay my messages to my gmail account when somebody send email to info@mydomain.com and also how to tell to my apps on my server to use my gmail account instead
[23:54] <Chriys> thanks again for your help guys
[23:55] <qman__> you can set up your server to send messages using a gmail account, but not to retrieve them, they get delivered into the gmail account
[23:55] <qman__> you can then retrieve them with any pop or imap client
[23:55] <qman__> or just use the gmail interface
[23:56] <qman__> and that does not apply to using your own domain
[23:56] <qman__> when you set up the gmail account, that's where the mail is sent from, so you@gmail.com
[23:56] <qman__> if you want to send mail from your actual domain you need to pay for a server or service
[23:57] <tonyyarusso> Chriys: I'm heading home now, but if you remind me later I can give you some configs to start from.
[23:57] <qman__> there are hundreds of options, so I can't really tell you what's best for you
[23:58] <tonyyarusso> I have a server that sends mail through my gmail account.
[23:58] <tonyyarusso> As for *incoming* mail to info@mydomain.com, that's a bit trickier - first check whether your domain registrar offers a free mail alias option.
