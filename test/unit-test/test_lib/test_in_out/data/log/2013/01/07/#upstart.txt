[13:36] <leandrosansilva> Hello to all. What signal is sent to the process when I call service stop or service restart? I used SIGTERM in my application for some time, but suddenly it stopped working
[13:36] <leandrosansilva> the signal isn't treated anymore
[14:00] <jodh> leandrosansilva: SIGTERM is the default unless you've specified 'kill signal' (http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#kill-signal). You are using the SysV commands. What happens if you use the Upstart command 'stop $job'?
[15:12] <xnox> jodh: =) mumble =)
[15:35] <xnox> jodh: stgraber: how to cross-compile libnih
[15:35] <xnox> considering that it tries to execute nih-dbus-tool
[15:35] <xnox> build two?
[15:36] <xnox> for the build
[15:36] <xnox> and then for the host
[15:36] <xnox> ok. I'll do that.
[15:37] <xnox> *sigh*
[16:40] <stgraber> xnox, jodh: success: UPSTART_SESSION=unix:abstract=/com/ubuntu/upstart-session/201105/24023
[16:40] <xnox> awesome =)
[16:40] <stgraber> now I just need to make initctl look for that environment variable
[16:42] <xnox> there are nih helpers for environment. but in xdg bits I simply used getenv.
[17:04] <xnox> jodh: thank you !
[17:05] <jodh> xnox: thank you! Great piece of work - I just caught a few typos ;)
[17:05] <jodh> stgraber: shiny! :)
[18:05] <SpamapS> stgraber: does that mean we can run two upstarts on the same dbus?
[22:27] <ajp> hi all, i'm trying to run my script on startup through upstart on my ubuntu server. What do I save my job file as? and where do I put it?
