[07:23] <Eroskzn> i need help with software updates not able to download from getdeb
[07:27] <Eroskzn> am i in the wrong channel , can someone help me please
[07:28] <hateball> Eroskzn: Well getdeb is a third party repo, so
[07:29] <Eroskzn> sorry i'm new to this
[07:29] <Eroskzn> where must i check or ask for help
[08:02] <Senjai> Just how different is Kubuntu from Ubuntu?
[08:02] <Aknot> ubuntu uses unity, kubuntu uses kde
[08:03] <Aknot> kde is the logical system while unity is marketed towards apple fanatics and other fashionable consumers
[08:03] <Senjai> Well
[08:04] <Senjai> I dislike the move from Gnome
[08:04] <Senjai> and the last time I was ingrained in the environment it used Gnome
[08:04] <Aknot> gnome was very good before they moved to gnome shell
[08:04] <Senjai> I like the windows-type UI Kubuntu appears to use, I'm concerned with compatability with some ubuntu apps
[08:05] <Senjai> Im very.. uninitiated.. well not so much, but enough to have to ask questions
[08:05] <Aknot> there is a kde "version" for every ubuntu program
[08:05] <Aknot> or kde program for gtk program i should say
[08:05] <Aknot> so i suggest always install kde variant
[08:05] <Senjai> And I think there are ways to install a gtk program, as long as you have the dependancies met right?
[08:06] <Senjai> You can run gtk programs in a kde environment. I think.
[08:06] <Senjai> Without having a GTK desktop
[08:06] <Senjai> Is this correct?
[08:06] <Aknot> yes you can install them fine but they might look worse because they dont match the theme and they dont integrate to system tray etc aswell as qt (kde) programs
[08:07] <Senjai> Oh, Kde programs are all build with Qt?
[08:07] <Aknot> yes
[08:07] <Senjai> I dont mind
[08:07] <Senjai> just as long as I can still use the programs
[08:07] <FlameReaper-PC> Depends on how you have them installed. I don't know if any post-install modifications are made by distros to improve the look and feel of GTK apps
[08:07] <FlameReaper-PC> as far as I know using (K)ubuntu
[08:07] <FlameReaper-PC> it's pretty smooth sailing for me
[08:08] <Senjai> Yea, I'll try it out then
[08:08] <Senjai> Thanks for your opinions.
[08:08] <Aknot> senjai which gtk programs do u mean specifically? im sure we can find u kde replacement
[08:08] <Senjai> Music player, starts with C
[08:08] <Senjai> that I'm worried about
[08:08] <FlameReaper-PC> though I think I customized my build a lot
[08:08] <FlameReaper-PC> Clementine?
[08:08] <Senjai> Streams radio from lasst.fm and such
[08:08] <Aknot> clementine?
[08:08] <Senjai> Clementine
[08:08] <Senjai> yea
[08:08] <Aknot> clementine is kde :D
[08:08] <Senjai> Mind slow tonight.
[08:08] <Aknot> and i use it
[08:08] <FlameReaper-PC> I think it's originally built in Qt
[08:08] <Aknot> its wonderful
[08:08] <FlameReaper-PC> so KDE should be able to display it well
[08:08] <Senjai> Sorry for asking the silly questions then
[08:08] <Senjai> lol
[08:09] <Aknot> np :P
[08:09] <FlameReaper-PC> somehow it doesn't work on mine, but I might need to look back at why I can't
[08:09] <FlameReaper-PC> because sometimes these problems can be very specific per person...
[08:09] <FlameReaper-PC> amarok is fine for me but might be a tad too heavy :P
[08:09] <FlameReaper-PC> hence why I depend on audacious a lot
[08:09] <Aknot> flamereaper how come clementine doesnt work??
[08:09] <FlameReaper-PC> Aknot: on mine?
[08:10] <FlameReaper-PC> I can't remember
[08:10] <FlameReaper-PC> what error it threw out on the terminal last time I tried
[08:10] <Aknot> did u try reinstall?
[08:10] <FlameReaper-PC> I did, but that didn't seem to help
[08:10] <FlameReaper-PC> well it was quite sometime ago and I'm currently settling on Amarok and/or Audacious for music players
[08:10] <Aknot> try minirok, its amarok without all the crap
[08:10] <FlameReaper-PC> Tried, but somehow I didn't like it :P
[08:10] <Aknot> okok
[08:11] <Senjai_> Virtual box kicked me off :/
=== Senjai_ is now known as Senjai
[08:11] <FlameReaper-PC> Aknot: guess can't really persuade someone who's comfortable with what they have even though there are better options eh :P
[08:11] <Aknot> true true
[08:11] <Senjai> Last question, is there any downside to installing via Wubi
[08:12] <jackyalcine> just a tad bit slower of a system, from my personal trials.
[08:12] <Aknot> ive never tried wubi
[08:12] <Aknot> why not just do proper install?
[08:12] <FlameReaper-PC> tried and despaired when there's a new distro release
[08:12] <Aknot> i mean if u like kde that is
[08:12] <FlameReaper-PC> and the migration from Wubi to a full partition is quite a work out
[08:12] <Senjai> Yea
[08:13] <Senjai> Thats my proble FlameReaper-PC
[08:13] <Senjai> Im uninstalling the wubi
[08:13] <Senjai> because its slow as crap
[08:13] <Senjai> I had Ubuntu 12.04
[08:13] <FloodBotK1> Senjai: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[08:13] <Aknot> senjai just do proper kubuntu install :D
[08:13] <Senjai> cleared it to install kbuntu 12.10
[08:13] <Senjai> Ugh, gotta find a usb drive
[08:13] <Senjai> or an old ipod..
[08:13] <FlameReaper-PC> Senjai: Here's a tip - back-up your home folder
[08:13] <Senjai> Why?
[08:13] <FlameReaper-PC> and when you do a partition install
[08:14] <FlameReaper-PC> just unload them into the new home folder
[08:14] <Senjai> yea, i wanted fresh of fresh of fresh though. Make sure none of the old issues come over.
[08:14] <Senjai> I have all my important stuff backed up into windows
[08:14] <Senjai> Via mount -t ntfs... etc
[08:14] <FlameReaper-PC> because most apps you use will have their configurations kept into that home folder
[08:14] <Senjai> Oh thats fine,
[08:14] <FlameReaper-PC> well it's fine if you want a fresh restart though
[08:14] <Senjai> I'd like to start fresh
[08:15] <FlameReaper-PC> I think I might consider that
[08:15] <Senjai> Fresh start?
[08:15] <FlameReaper-PC> and keep only documents produced from the old partition
[08:15] <FlameReaper-PC> Senjai: Yes
[08:15] <Senjai> I only kept files
[08:15] <Senjai> configurations can hurt you, in my experience
[08:15] <FlameReaper-PC> Yes
[08:15] <FlameReaper-PC> especially if your current install can't mirror the previous ones
[08:16] <Senjai> it wont
[08:16] <Senjai> Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Wubi) --> Kubuntu 12.10 (partitioned)
[08:16] <Senjai> It would be.. iffy
[08:16] <FlameReaper-PC> yea
[08:16] <Senjai> then having to go through and purge one by one as issues arise would be.. annoying
[08:16] <Senjai> lol
[08:16] <FlameReaper-PC> well it won't hurt to keep some specific configs though
[08:16] <Senjai> Are the repos the same as ubuntus
[08:16] <FlameReaper-PC> it is
[08:17] <Aknot> i always do fresh install
[08:17] <Aknot> most hassle free
[08:17] <FlameReaper-PC> well kubuntu is basically a KDE Ubuntu
[08:17] <FlameReaper-PC> so things are as simple as that
[08:17] <FlameReaper-PC> its just a matter of DEs
[08:18] <FlameReaper-PC> right, I guess I'll want to try a cross compilation now
[08:18] <ovidiu-florin> hello world
[08:18] <ovidiu-florin> good morning :D
[08:18] <FlameReaper-PC> hello ovidiu-florin and good... afternoon :D
[08:19] <ovidiu-florin> what's the discution topic ?
[08:19] <ovidiu-florin> :D
[08:20] <Senjai> My noobiness
[08:20] <Senjai> Not even sure how much i remember about linux operation
[08:20] <Senjai> gotta learn bash and the file system all over again
[08:21] <ovidiu-florin> Senjai: have you tried using windows?
[08:21] <Senjai> ovidiu-florin, sorry?
[08:21] <ovidiu-florin> (^ not a recommendation )
[08:22] <ovidiu-florin> I thought you might have used windows or something, that being the cause you forgot these
[08:22] <Senjai> I use windows now.
[08:22] <Senjai> I was a hobbiest programmer some years back
[08:22] <Senjai> but its been a while
[08:22] <Senjai> Had to use windows for school, and work
[08:23] <FlameReaper-PC> I use everything that I can get my hands on, either by handover or self-obtaining
[08:24] <FlameReaper-PC> so far my life with usage has been revolving around Windows and (K)Ubuntu, with a little bit of Mac
[08:24] <FlameReaper-PC> as a user, I must say, I really like working with Ubuntu a lot
[08:24] <ovidiu-florin> I've managed to switch completly to kubuntu
[08:25] <ovidiu-florin> haven't used windows in more than 5 years
[08:25] <FlameReaper-PC> Windows for a lot of things is a given, but some specific tasks I can only do in (K)Ubuntu because... it's hell of a lot easy :P
[08:25] <ovidiu-florin> I use it a little bit now for cross compiling
[08:25] <Senjai> I will never ever use a mac
[08:25] <ovidiu-florin> but nothing more
[08:25] <Senjai> ovidiu-florin, you obviously dont work in finance
[08:25] <Senjai> ll
[08:26] <Senjai> lol
[08:26] <FlameReaper-PC> I'm about to attempt a cross-compile of the gimp-painters
[08:26] <FlameReaper-PC> of the 2.7 alpha branch
[08:26] <ovidiu-florin> I work in stock marchet
[08:26] <ovidiu-florin> Senjai: ^
[08:26] <Senjai> really? Where
[08:26] <Senjai> What do you do
[08:26] <ovidiu-florin> Romania
[08:27] <ovidiu-florin> right now implementing the FIX protocol with Qt
[08:27] <ovidiu-florin> via the QuickFix engine with a custom framework on top
[08:28] <Senjai> What exchange do you work with in Romania?
[08:28] <Senjai> I know nothing about that country
[08:28] <Senjai> lol
[08:29] <ovidiu-florin> we have a relationship with a company in chicago
[08:30] <ovidiu-florin> kind of partners
[08:31] <ovidiu-florin> just asked simmilar on #kde, how would kubuntu perform on a tablet?
[08:31] <ovidiu-florin> or touch screen ultrabook?
[08:32] <Aknot> doesnt kde have some "mode" made for tablets and touchscreen
[08:32] <ovidiu-florin> yes it does
[08:32] <ovidiu-florin> but Kubuntu should also have Plasma Notebook
[08:33] <ovidiu-florin> from what someone from #kde told me
[08:33] <ovidiu-florin> how do I activate/use that?
[08:33] <ovidiu-florin> also has*
[08:36] <away> system settings -> workspace behavior -> workspace

[08:53] <jackyalcine> 6 hours for upgrade to 13.04
[09:03] <Aknot> did 13.04 come out already?
[09:03] <Unit193> 13.04 stands for April, 2013.
[09:05] <Aknot> lol i never realised that they were dates :D
[09:10] <ovidiu-florin> Aknot: I think it came out allready, or atleast a beta or something
[09:11] <Aknot> one of the ubuntu devs said that ubuntu might become rolling release after 14.04
[09:13] <FlameReaper-PC> <ovidiu-florin> but Kubuntu should also have Plasma Notebook
[09:13] <FlameReaper-PC> you mean plasma-netbook
[09:14] <FlameReaper-PC> just sudo apt-get plasma-netbook. can't remember what's the package name in apt
[09:14] <FlameReaper-PC> but I think it's that
[09:15] <ovidiu-florin> FlameReaper-PC: what are you answering to?
[09:15] <FlameReaper-PC> ovidiu-florin: about your question about the Plasma Notebook (Netbook actually) UI
[09:15] <ovidiu-florin> away told me how to activate it, and I did
[09:15] <ovidiu-florin> my reaction was whoooooaaaa
[09:15] <FlameReaper-PC> I really think that with touchscreen keyboard integration
[09:16] <FlameReaper-PC> and a few tweaks to it
[09:16] <ovidiu-florin> it's allready installed by default
[09:16] <FlameReaper-PC> it can really be used for a touchscreen environment
[09:16] <ovidiu-florin> I hope so
[09:16] <FlameReaper-PC> I really liked that, though I'm defaulting to the desktop appearance
[09:16] <FlameReaper-PC> rather than netbook
[09:16] <FlameReaper-PC> using the netbook UI was fun though
[09:17] <FlameReaper-PC> wow, my college's connection when trying to use git is pretty horrible
[09:17] <FlameReaper-PC> guess downloading movies is all that my college's network is good for :P
[09:18] <ovidiu-florin> I plan to purchase a windows 8 tabled
[09:18] <ovidiu-florin> erase windows 8
[09:18] <ovidiu-florin> and put kubuntu on it
[09:18] <ovidiu-florin> opinions?
[09:18] <FlameReaper-PC> I don't know how it works though for Win8
[09:18] <FlameReaper-PC> best get an x86 tab
[09:18] <FlameReaper-PC> because if you get an ARM tab
[09:18] <ovidiu-florin> intel atom?
[09:18] <FlameReaper-PC> yes
[09:19] <FlameReaper-PC> also with a Win8 tab
[09:19] <FlameReaper-PC> I'd like to anticipate that the process of wiping Win8 out of it isn't as easy as we'd like to think
[09:20] <ovidiu-florin> not necessarily this one but something like it: http://www.emag.ro/tableta-asus-memo-cu-procesor-intel-174-atom-dual-core-z2760-1-6ghz-10-1-2gb-ddr2-64gb-wi-fi-bluetooth-4-0-microsoft-windows-8-white-me400c-1a013w/pd/E1LMNBBBM/?ref=nl&zone=box_43&unit=0.5&id=1027&emag_click_id=07ff0c8f621a6293c61e5614167950f0&ref=afs
[09:20] <Aknot> I had some small tearing on videos and on youtube videos. So i uninstalled ati fglrx drivers to see if its because of that. Now when i move windows they are extremely laggy and i still have tearing
[09:20] <FlameReaper-PC> if its anything like Acer's Iconia w700/w701 tabs then I guess the difficulties is as hard as installing (K)Ubuntu on a regular netbook
[09:21] <FlameReaper-PC> ovidiu-florin: that looks good, and doesn't seem to have any possible difficulties you might have when trying to install
[09:21] <FlameReaper-PC> but I suppose you might want to do some self-study whether you can even try booting a live USB/SD card session on it
[09:22] <ovidiu-florin> it's like a netbook without a keyboard and with touchscreen

[10:36] <robtygart> I don't understand what part of his link I am to look at?
[10:36] <elliria> It has some suggestions - the best appeared to be a way of booting with no theme at all. I get the impression from your error message that Kubuntu still thinks there's a theme.

[10:47] <lordievader> But it's a good alternative :)
[10:48] <mahesh_> <lordievader> : I was disconnected. Can you please help me?
[10:48] <robtygart> lordievader: yah but I could not figure out how
[10:49] <robtygart> its 3AM its too late.
[10:49] <lordievader> robtygart: Ah, that explains it :P
[10:50] <lordievader> mahesh_: A conclusion I made earlier: It seems to me that all of those packages depend on wvdial, and that one depends on libwvstrams4.6-extras... but that one also complains about something,..
[10:50] <lordievader> mahesh_: What comes to mind it that they might be in a repo that is not by default enabled.
[10:51] <mahesh_> ok, so what will be the solution on this?
[10:51] <mahesh_> I am nopt able to install any thing due to this...
[10:52] <lordievader> mahesh_: Can you pastebin the file: /etc/apt/sources.list ?
=== durden is now known as Durden
[10:54] <mahesh_> <lordievader> : Do I need to run it in terminal?
=== Durden is now known as Durden_nq
[10:54] <lordievader> mahesh_: Yes copy the output of: cat /etc/apt/sources.list to pastebin.
[10:55] <mahesh_> ok
[10:55] <mahesh_> done
[10:56] <lordievader> mahesh_: Could you send me the link ;)
[10:56] <mahesh_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1585473/
[10:56] <mahesh_> here it is
[10:57] <elliria> Did mahesh_ try sudo apt-get install -f
[10:57] <mahesh_> <elliria>  : Already tried mate but not wroking :(
[10:58] <lordievader> mahesh_: Doesn't seem like there is a repo missing/deactivated.
[10:58] <elliria> Darn.
[10:58] <lordievader> elliria: Uhu...
[10:58] <mahesh_> ok..
[10:58] <lordievader> mahesh_: Try "sudo dpkg -r gedit; sudo apt-get -f install"
[10:59] <mahesh_> ok
[10:59] <mahesh_> E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)
[11:00] <mahesh_> Do you want me to provide full screen print?
[11:00] <lordievader> mahesh_: Yes please.
[11:00] <mahesh_> ok
[11:01] <mahesh_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1585503/
[11:04] <lordievader> mahesh_: Does it give the message "no installed package" for: "sudo dpkg -r libwvstreams4.6-extras libwvstreams4.6-extras wvdial gnome-ppp"
[11:05] <mahesh_> <lordievader> I think this one worked
[11:06] <lordievader> mahesh_: Now what happens when you run sudo apt-get install -f, it should not do anything...
=== durden is now known as kobolt_qa

[11:07] <mahesh_> <lordievader> Is it worked?
[11:07] <lordievader> mahesh_: Looks good, run the "sudo apt-get -f install" again, should not do anything...
[11:08] <mahesh_> ok
[11:09] <mahesh_> just tried : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1585554/
[11:09] <mahesh_> <lordievader> : Looks like it is fixing now
[11:09] <mahesh_> ;)
[11:09] <lordievader> mahesh_: Well it installed the package. Be sure to update before installing gedit again.
[11:10] <mahesh_> sudo apt-get update
[11:10] <mahesh_> right?
[11:10] <lordievader> sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[11:11] <mahesh_> ok
[11:14] <mahesh_> it is asking me to press Y or N : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1585584/
[11:14] <mahesh_> Do I suppose to proceed? with Y
[11:15] <lordievader> mahesh_: There is a kernel update in it, ever had trouble updating your kernel? If not you can procede.
[11:15] <mahesh_> ok...
[11:15] <mahesh_> it is running now
[11:16] <mahesh_> <lordievader> : I think this is fix now, all credit goes to you. I really appreciate your help!
[11:17] <lordievader> mahesh_: No problem, glad I could be of service.
[11:17] <mahesh_> <lordievader> I would like to keep in touch with you, do you have FB account so that I can be in touch with you?

[13:35] <lordievader> ed346765: Research how you can decrease the number of read/writes to the disk.

[14:10] <sbivol> wakeup: Yes, I've seen that on a friend's laptop with nVidia graphics on Kubuntu 12.10. now he's on 13.04 and no issues whatsoever with the graphics
[14:11] <BluesKaj> sbivol, I have a few "issues" with graphics on 13.04 , not sure if nvidia is at fault . i think it could be the latest KDE/Kwin
[14:11] <wakeup> sbivol: thanks can i rwvert it back
[14:11] <wakeup> Revert*
[14:13] <sbivol> wakeup: i'm playing with that laptop right now, and that specific issue is gone. as I see, he also changed his Plasma theme to a darker one. could you try that too?
[14:14] <wakeup> sbivol: thanks. İ will try that after going home :)
[14:15] <sbivol> BluesKaj: what kind of issues do you have? maybe I can check them on this laptop
[14:23] <BluesKaj> sbivol, system settings>user management crashes . I'm testing a new music player as requested by kubuntu-devel and it seems to not see me as part of the users and , but I'm the only user ,
[14:24] <BluesKaj> so i can't check the user management settings
[14:24] <sbivol> BluesKaj: user management is broken at the moment, people on #kubuntu-devel are aware and working on it. but that's not related to graphics :)
[14:25] <BluesKaj> yeah , well system settings is afaik
[14:26] <sbivol> BluesKaj: why would a music player need to know anything about users? seems weird
[14:26] <BluesKaj> and as I said before it could be the new KDE version
[14:26] <sbivol> BluesKaj: what player is it?
[14:28] <BluesKaj> Cantata , it appears to be like a PIM , optional database usage etc , with netstreaming capabilities , and music player daemon
[14:29] <sbivol> BluesKaj: sounds complex...
[14:29] <BluesKaj> clunky at this point and it just crashed when I changed the path to the external hdd where media is stored

Look for symptoms such as:  1.  Clicking on things and expecting them to open before you have even thought about clicking again. 2.  Expecting a computer to boot up before you have time to pour yourself a cup of coffee. " … you get the idea.  Any more?

[16:49] <lordievader> przemek: Download unetbootin :)
[16:50] <przemek> thank you Lord Vader
[16:50] <Torch> przemek: or run usb-creator-kde (which i have installed on 12.04)
[16:51] <przemek> thank you very much !
[16:52] <sbivol> przemek: if I'm not mistaken, you can simply write the ISO image with dd to your flash drive.

[17:03] <przemek> what's ean oem install for manufactures?
[17:05] <petersaints> przemek: It installs the OS ready to be used for the first time by a new user
[17:05] <petersaints> like when you buy a Windows PC
[17:05] <petersaints> and it boots with an initial user setup
[17:06] <petersaints> asking your name,  set the password, etc.
[17:06] <przemek> so i can creat users on first start?
[17:06] <przemek> yep?
[17:06] <przemek> create*
[17:06] <petersaints> I haven't made an OEM install in a long time. But when I did that was the behaviour
[17:06] <petersaints> on the first boot it prompts you to create a new user
[17:07] <przemek> ok i will try oem first if i get any problem i will reinstall os again
[17:07] <przemek> thank you
[17:07] <eshack> I'm about 90% sure that is correct, it is intended for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) to install the system for a new user.
[17:08] <eshack> 99%, not 90%. :)
[17:08] <eshack> It will be fine if you install it on your computer, though you don't get the advantage of setting up your user name and password during install.
[17:09] <przemek> all right

[17:38] <ethang> is it possible to read a 64 bit formatted hard drive on a 32 bit system?
[17:38] <ikonia> yes
[17:38] <ikonia> as hard disks are not formated 64 / 32 bit
[17:38] <ikonia> it's a file system
[17:39] <ethang> ikonia: I have a SATA drive from a bricked laptop hooked up through a USB adapter to my system but it doesn't recognize it
[17:39] <ikonia> that's nothing to do with 32/64 bit
[17:40] <ethang> ikonia: any ideas?
[17:40] <ikonia> depends in what way it's failing
[17:40] <ikonia> you've not given any info
[17:41] <ethang> ikonia: it just doesn't show up in available devices
[17:41] <ikonia> how big is the disk
[17:41] <ethang> 250 MB
[17:41] <ikonia> GB
[17:41] <ethang> sorry yes
[17:41] <ethang> GB
[17:41] <ikonia> just checking
[17:41] <ikonia> ok so in a shell if you do "sudo fdisk -l" you should see the disk
[17:41] <ikonia> can you verify if you can
[17:42] <ethang> ok I'll try it
[17:43] <ethang> not there
[17:45] <KJ_agent007> does the drive spin up when you plug it in?
[17:45] <ethang> KJ_agent007: yes
[17:45] <KJ_agent007> can you hear the heads moving?
[17:46] <ethang> no
[17:46] <ethang> but i'll try powering down then up again
[17:46] <KJ_agent007> then the drive may be doa
[17:47] <KJ_agent007> I had an old laptop the got dropped and the os crasked due to drive failure
[17:47] <ethang> KJ_agent007: I think I heard them moving
[17:47] <KJ_agent007> however I was able to use one of the 60 gig drives as a backup for awhile
[17:48] <KJ_agent007> till it finally went tits up
[17:48] <ethang> lol
[17:48] <axe> Hi guys
[17:48] <KJ_agent007> then I got a terrabite drive for 90 bucks from walmart
[17:49] <KJ_agent007> hi axe
[17:50] <KJ_agent007> if any partition program can see the drive then you should be able to mount it
[17:50] <KJ_agent007> such as gparted or kparted
[17:51] <ethang> KJ_agent007: ok
[17:51] <ethang> I'll try
[17:51] <KJ_agent007> cool cool
[17:51] <sbivol> TheDrums: on the Kubuntu LiveCD there is „partitionmanager”
[17:52] <sbivol> sorry, I meant ethang: ^
[17:52] <KJ_agent007> yup
[17:52] <KJ_agent007> kparted
[17:52] <KJ_agent007> and most rescue cd's have partitioning tools also
[17:53] <sbivol> KJ_agent007: kparted is no more, at least not under that name
[17:54] <KJ_agent007> hum, lemme check
[17:55] <KJ_agent007> ok the kde partition manager
[17:55] <KJ_agent007> it's basically the same as gparted but for kde
[17:56] <ethang> about to try it out
[18:02] <ethang> KJ_agent007: nope.  Kparted doesn't see it
[18:03] <ethang> I'm going to try the other hard drive
