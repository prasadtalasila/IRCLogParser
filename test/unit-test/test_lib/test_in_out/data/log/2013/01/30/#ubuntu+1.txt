[00:59] <MikeRL> Anyone available for assistance? Take your time.
[01:04] <TheLordOfTime> MikeRL, you should just post your question in channel rather than depend on one person to help you.
[01:04] <TheLordOfTime> and then wait once you've asked.
[01:05] <MikeRL> Oops sorry.
[01:05] <MikeRL> So,how do I post the question in the channel?
[01:06] <TheLordOfTime> just like you asked a question now :P
[01:06] <TheLordOfTime> you just ask your question and then hit enter and wait
[01:07] <MikeRL> OK. How long should I give it? Half hour? Hour?
[01:07] <MikeRL> I know I can set the IRC client to make a noise when a response happens.

[11:50] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[14:38] <dholbach> Day 2 of https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek starts in 22 minutes in #ubuntu-classroom
[16:12] <Tribaal> hi all! startx dies for me at startup since last upgrade - what can I do to help?
[16:15] <Tribaal> soory, I mean since http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1589997/
[16:31] <BluesKaj> Tribaal, you used sudo I hope ..do you get any erroros when starting X ?
[16:34] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: unfortunately yes, and let me dig for the logs
[16:41] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1590073/
[16:41] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: that means lightdm does not start on boot
[16:44] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: I get  a symbol lookup error in x-0-greeter.log, but that's the only suspicious thing in the lightdm logs
[16:50] <BluesKaj> Tribaal, yeah , have you tried thr nomodeset option in the grub line after "quiet splash " ?
[16:50] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: not yet - trying
[16:52] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: exact same (after a sudo update-grub of course)
[16:53] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: I get the Ubuntu loading screen - but not the login
[16:54] <BluesKaj> Tribaal, can you get to tty ?
[16:54] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: yes
[16:55] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: network is up, everything seems fine except for the absence of X :)
[16:56] <BluesKaj> ok , what graphics card and driver? , glxinfo | grep OpenGL
[16:56] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: glxinfo can't open the display
[16:56] <BluesKaj> you may have to install mesa-utils for that command to give you any info
[16:57] <Tribaal> I get, precisely: "Error: unable to open display"
[16:57] <Tribaal> Graphics car is an intel HD 4000
[16:58] <Tribaal> s/car/card/
[17:02] <Tribaal> Ah well maybe it's just time for me to reinstall
[17:05] <BluesKaj> Tribaal, sudo modprobe i915 ..if there's no output then the driver loaded
[17:06] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: it is
[17:06] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: (no output)
[17:06] <BluesKaj> ok try startx
[17:07] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: I get the same output as before
[17:07] <BluesKaj> Tribaal, hqave you done an update/upgrade lately ?
[17:08] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: it booted fine, then I updated: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1589997/ then it stopped starting it at boot
[17:09] <BluesKaj> bummer :(
[17:09] <BluesKaj> I have to go for a few mins ...bbl
[17:10] <Tribaal> BluesKaj: is there such athing as xdiagnose for the command line?
[17:25] <mibofra_smart> hi
[17:28] <mibofra_smart> After today upadate , I can't start lightdm . If try with lightdm-session , the error this time is : "x-session-manager: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libgdk-3.so.0: undefined symbol: wl_registry_interface
[17:29] <mibofra_smart> what should I do ?
[17:32] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: ohh so I'm not alone :)
[17:32] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: intel graphics card as well?
[17:33] <mibofra_smart> yes :D .
[17:33] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: where do you see the error? What log file?
[17:34] <mibofra_smart> but I've had this problem with natty , oneiric , precise and quantal dev branch ; but now I can't fix it XD .
[17:35] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: did you open a bug repot already or should I?
[17:35] <mibofra_smart> I saw the error with : sudo lightdm-session command .
[17:42] <mibofra_smart> Tribal: have you got the same problem :)) ?
[17:42] <mibofra_smart> *Tribaal
[17:47] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: yes, same problem
[17:48] <mibofra_smart> so we can't solve :D ?
[17:49] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: I don't know. I will open a bug first
[17:49] <mibofra_smart> I think so too .
[18:03] <Tribaal> ok, I opened a bug for that https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lightdm/+bug/1110645

[18:07] <mibofra_smart> Tribaal : I know that :) .
[18:07] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: sure - just making sure :)
[18:07] <mibofra_smart> :) ok .

[18:37] <mibofra_smart> thanks :)
[18:40] <Tribaal> hum invalid
[18:43] <Tribaal> oh maybe it's due to the qt5 ppa
[18:43] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: did you install the ubuntu phone SDK by any chance?
[18:44] <mibofra_smart> I've installed it . But a minute , your machine is a 64bit ; my machine is a 32bit
[18:44] <mibofra_smart> .
[18:45] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: probably doesn't make a difference - the libgdk version we both have is different from the one vanilla Ubuntu expects
[18:48] <mibofra_smart> yes , I know . Maybe I've to try to install the vanilla one .
[18:50] <mibofra_smart> I've x edgers team ppa :D .
[18:58] <Tribaal> mibofra_smart: downgrading libwayland0 to 1.0.3-0ubuntu2 saolved the lightdm problem for me (but apparently I need more stuff downgraded)
[19:23] <mibofra_smart> Tribaal: Me too :) .
[19:24] <mibofra_smart> yes , downgraded lightdm-* packages too .
[20:32] <Tribaal> mibofa_smart: did that fix the problem for you?
