[01:02] <hanlond> I have a question regarding the use of & in the shell
[01:03] <escott> hanlond, and...
[01:03] <hanlond> I have no GUI installed, so if I use VI to edit a file and add & the the end of the command, how do I then start using VI
[01:03] <escott> hanlond, fg
[01:04] <hanlond> and is there a way to unfocus from VI afterwards?
[01:04] <escott> hanlond, ctrl-z if vi doesnt capture it
[01:05] <hanlond> will that work with any process?
[01:06] <escott> hanlond, any process that trap SIGSTP
[01:06] <hanlond> Thank you very much
[01:06] <escott> hanlond, or remap ctrl-z
[01:14] <hplc> hello, how does server version comes shipped when it comes to dns? to servre localhost? localdomain? or not at all by default?
[01:15] <escott> hplc, presumably not installed by default
[01:16] <hplc> escott, but if choosen during install i mean
[01:16] <hplc> my english aint that great
[01:22] <escott> hplc, it will serve any computer configured to ask it for dns information. so if it is also a dhcp server it would presumably suggest itself as the dns server
[01:25] <hplc> escott, so in that case one can say that it would serve the homelan / domain?, im not that good at being 100% correct, but i hope i make sense enough
[01:26] <escott> hplc, put it to you this way. i'm making some tea, i will serve you some but only if you come by and ask....
[01:26] <escott> hplc, you have to configure the other computers on the domain to ask that computer if you want it to be the dns server
[01:27] <hplc> escott, ok, yes that way i get it
[01:29] <hplc> can the server version act as dns / dhcp and be the firewall at same time? or put something else to guard the border?
[01:29] <escott> hplc, yes. thats probably the easiest setup to configure
[01:29] <escott> !ics | hplc
[01:29] <ubottu> hplc: If you want to share the internet connection of your Ubuntu machine with other machines in the network see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
[01:30] <hplc> yes, recon that from "firestarter" in the desktop edition
[01:31] <hplc> how does ubuntu going to handle the UEFI? the shim bootloader?
[01:32] <escott> hplc, the "shim bootloader" is for secure boot. there is support for direct efi loading not sure its in the ubuntu kernel though
[01:32] <hplc> and does ubuntu support use of btrfs? it seems like a solution where one can add HDDs as time goes by
[01:33] <RoyK> btrfs isn't very stable yet
[01:33] <escott> hplc, yes buts far from a usable filesystem
[01:33] <hplc> escott, but doesnt UEFI mean 100% hardware cutoff anything that isnt MS?
[01:33] <hplc> RoyK, escott ok
[01:33] <escott> hplc, huh?
[01:34] <RoyK> hplc: if you want raid, use md
[01:34] <hplc> escott, i meant, the idea behind uefi is to allow ONLY ms to pass the bootloader on a hardware level due ti INTEL chips set that way? right?
[01:34] <escott> no
[01:36] <hplc> i was under that impression after reading linux format nr 167
[01:36] <escott> hplc, you read it wrong
[01:36] <escott> and you are talking about secure boot not efi
[01:37] <escott> and you are incorrect about secure boot :)
[01:37] <hplc> but isnt secure boot and UEFI the same thing?
[01:37] <escott> that said i dont think secure boot is very useful so i would disable it
[01:37] <escott> no they are not
[01:40] <hplc> im confused, qoute from page 38 "UEFI and / or microsofts secure boot is hampering manufactoring of linux or dual boot computers" end quote
[01:41] <patdk-lap> everything you read on the internet must be true :)
[01:42] <hplc> no not internet, the paperback version of a magazine
[01:43] <escott> hplc, there has been an enormous amount written about this. you are welcome to read about it
[01:43] <patdk-lap> those still exist?
[01:43] <escott> hplc, many laptops from Dell/Compaq/etc are shipping with 4 primary partitions (a boot partition, windows partition, recovery partition, and a OEM driver partition)
[01:44] <escott> i could write a sensationalist article about how that is hampering the installation of linux and how its an evil trick by MSFT
[01:45] <escott> or i could write about how its a relatively minor technical impediment for those who know what they are doing
[01:45] <hplc> but still, im confused, is "Linux Format" paperback magazine a joke? to me it looks quite serious
[01:45] <escott> i could even write about how evil microsoft ships windows partitioned in such a way as to use the ENTIRE disk
[01:45] <escott> all to prevent other operating systems from being easily and readily installed
[01:45] <escott> OMG sensationalist blog posting coming right up
[01:46] <hplc> ?
[01:48] <escott> hplc, (a) you arent going to have windows on the computer you are talking about because its a server (b) you can just disable secure boot (c) you can probably switch to bios boot mode if you want
[01:49] <hplc> escott, well yes, i do indeed consider using ubuntu server instead of my present FreeBSD
[01:52] <hplc> escott, and i cant understand what is so funny about me mentioning that paperback magazine, is its articles made up out of thin air? i dont understand
[01:52] <escott> hplc, i didnt make fun of the magazine, but there are better things to read than linux format
[01:53] <escott> hplc, lwn.net is very solid
[01:54] <hplc> escott, is it something that exist both in electronic and paperform? what does it cost?
[01:55] <escott> hplc, website only. there is a membership if you want to read the current one or you can read a week or two behind
[01:56] <hplc> escott, as a homeuser, that doesnt need to keep up with cutting edge news, is the free version enough? right?
[01:57] <escott> hplc, a one week old lwn article is probably more up to date than a print edition of linux format that has been sitting on the shelf of B&N for the past week
[01:59] <escott> hplc, it can be very technical in some parts that may or may not be what you are interested in reading
[02:00] <hplc> escott, yes that is more than welcome
[02:02] <mortrca> I replaced the motherboard in my server and now I'm having problems getting it to boot. Everything seems to be fine at first, everything reports "OK" as it starts, until it gets to Tomcat. There it just says "* Starting Tomcat servlet engine tomcat6" and hangs.
[02:03] <mortrca> Apache fails to start, but it reports a syntax error in apache2.conf and then moves on without haning.
[02:03] <mortrca> *hanging.
[02:04] <mortrca> Troubleshooting pointers anyone?
[02:07] <escott> mortrca, is the networking working correctly?
[02:07] <escott> mortrca, ie if your interface card was on the motherboard it will have a new MAC address and perhaps a new device
[02:08] <mortrca> escott: It displays a message about waiting another 60 seconds for network configuration which I haven't seen before
[02:08] <mortrca> and moves on after the 60 seconds
[02:08] <escott> mortrca, i would look into that. make sure that something isn't misconfigured there
[02:09] <escott> mortrca, check /etc/udev and all the /etc/networking stuff
[02:26] <mortrca> escott: I seem to have bigger issues. I now cannot get a BIOS post or any video out from the board. I think this is now a hardware problem.
[02:26] <mortrca> Thanks for the suggestion, if I ever get that far I'll give it a try.
[02:29] <iamzim> Good day, i'm thinking about going for a psad+fwsnort setup, is there a more effective solution?
[03:47] <hanlond> I have a question regarding /etc/network/interfaces
[03:48] <hanlond> if I have a DNS server pointing to and IP address www.xxx.yy.zz
[03:49] <hanlond> what do i need to set the following to in order to get an SSH client working
[03:49] <hanlond> I have
[03:50] <hanlond> auto eth0 \n iface eth0 inet static \n address www.xxx.yy.zz netmask 255.255.255 network 192.168.0.0 broadcast 192.168.0.255 gateway 192.168.0.1
[03:51] <escott> hanlond, dns is handled through /etc/resolv.conf

[09:21] <Corey> I'm trying to resize a KVM guest that itself uses KVM.  Every time I make the attempt, I have to blow away the partitions in fdisk, recreate them, and reboot.  This changes the UUID, and leaves me unbootable.
[09:22] <Corey> (I'm operating on a copy)
[09:24] <Corey> Screw it.  Adding the new space as a new partition, and I'll handle it in LVM. :-p
[09:29] <Corey> THERE we go.
[09:29] <Corey> Add that as a new PV, add the new PV to a VG, lvresize, resize2fs, and we're in business.
[09:29] <Corey> "simple" as that.
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[09:32] <e_t_> What are you using as the block device for the first-level KVM?
[09:33] <Corey> e_t_: LVM.
[09:33] <Corey> So yeah, turtles all the way down. :-)
[09:33] <Corey> (LVM is on top of a hardware RAID10 of direct attached storage.)
[09:33] <Corey> The sad thing is that this... is my personal environment, not work's. :-)
[09:33] <e_t_> So you lvresize the storage volume for the first-level guest and it blows away your partitions?
[09:34] <Corey> Not exactly.  This is under libvirsh.
[09:34] <Corey> So on the host, I copy the old VM's lv to a new, larger one.
[09:34] <Corey> In that new larger one, fdisk sees the new space, but nothing else does.
[09:35] <Corey> So deleting the root and lvm partitions in fdisk and recreating them with the lastblock boundary further out (which works if you're NOT using UUIDs) fails horribly at reboot time.
[09:35] <Corey> Now I feel like a grumpy old man shaking his fist and screaming to get off his lawn.
[09:36] <Corey> This is also Lucid; not sure if it's any better in Precise.
[09:36] <e_t_> Does it work any better if you mount by label instead of UUID?
[09:37] <Corey> Most likely, but I'm not sure how to make that work in Ubuntu.
[09:37] <Corey> A cursory search didn't turn up anything.
[09:37] <Corey> "adding the extra space as /dev/vda6" worked a treat though.
[09:38] <e_t_> I don't think fstab is distro-specific.
[09:38] <Corey> e_t_: I suspect that cutting the box to mount by label, rebooting, and then updating the uuid's with the CURRENT partition table would work as well.
[09:38] <Corey> e_t_: No, but update-grub and the stuff surrounding it are.
[09:38] <Corey> It's not even fstab; it doesn't get to that point.  It's the initrd and the kernel locations.
[09:39] <Corey> So I'd have to update grub.cnf
[09:39] <Corey> Or whatever the name of the file in question is, in CentOS (my strong suit) it's menu.lst

[13:09] <damrock> i got some packet drops with my intel ethernet adapter
[13:10] <damrock> i didn't had this problem with kernel 3.7
[13:11] <damrock> should i install the actual kernel module 1.2xy something?
[13:17] <RoyK> damrock: custom kernel?
=== Ursinha_ is now known as Ursinha
[14:42] <RoyK> seems either chkrootkit is out of sync with ubuntu, or that /sbin/init really is infected on 12.04
[14:44] <damrock> no custom kernel
[14:44] <damrock> ppa kernel
[14:44] <damrock> my SAS controller doesnt work with 3.7
[14:45] <damrock> but with 3.5, but with 3.5 ethernet is fucked up
[14:45] <patdk-lap> stop buying unsupported hardware?
[14:45] <damrock> lol
[14:45] <Tm_T> damrock: ppa kernels are most likely supported only by the maintainers of said ppa
[14:46] <damrock> marvell is proper supported
[14:46] <damrock> what should i buy, sil chipset?
[14:46] <patdk-lap> marvell is not very specific, they make LOTS of things
[14:46] <damrock> marvel provide its own kernel modules
[14:46] <damrock> but the way to compile moduels changed in 3.7
[14:47] <damrock> so i cannot compile the kernel module for 3.7 my sas controller
[14:47] <RoyK> what sas controller is this?
[14:48] <damrock> rocketraid 2720
[14:48] <damrock> 2 pieces of them
[14:48] <damrock> 16 x 2 tb drives with mdraid 5
[14:49] <RoyK> erm - 16 drives in raid-5?
[14:49] <RoyK> single raid5?
[14:50]  * RoyK mumbles something about playing with matches and gasoline
[14:50] <damrock> raid5 with 1 spare
[14:51] <RoyK> better convert that to raid-6...
[14:51] <damrock> yeah if i get the ethernet work in 3.5
[14:51] <RoyK> I'd use r6 with a spare or even split it up to smaller raid sets with that amount of drives...
[14:52] <damrock> i would have to wait for btrfs raid5
[14:52] <patdk-lap> no need for a spare
[14:52] <RoyK> what sort of nic?
[14:52] <damrock> intel e1000
[14:52] <patdk-lap> if you really want a spare, just throw the spare on the motherboard port
[14:52] <damrock> i put the spare to mobo port
[14:52] <damrock> 16 drives and 1 spare on mobo port
[14:52] <RoyK> damrock: should work, but perhaps new pci id
[14:54] <damrock> well i buy new hardware next month, 17 3tb wd red harddrives with intellipower and sell those 2tb ones
[14:54] <damrock> they are cheap pnly 130 bucks for each
[14:55] <RoyK> that's pretty good
[14:55] <damrock> im out of space...
[14:56] <RoyK> what are you storing on all this?
[14:56] <damrock> mkv
[14:57] <RoyK> video?
[14:57] <damrock> yes
[14:57] <RoyK> anyway - I'd recommend using r6 for such a setup - really
[14:59] <RoyK> large desktop-grade drives have rather high error rates
[14:59] <damrock> maybe i put the entire thing to lvm and run it with lvm
[15:00] <RoyK> lvm doesn't support raid[56], though
[15:01] <damrock> vgcreate does not work?
[15:02] <damrock> vgcreate vg1 /dev/md or something?
[15:02] <damrock> then mkfs.btrfs /dev/vg1/lv1?
[15:03] <RoyK> oh, yes, lvm on top of md works fine
[15:03]  * RoyK doesn't trust btrfs yet for production
[15:04] <damrock> oyu can't even trust kernel 3.5 for production
[15:04] <damrock> thats why im here with my ethernet problem with dropped packets
[15:05]  * RoyK sticks to LTS releases ;)
[15:05] <damrock> and its intel, not such a cheap chinese manufactuer
[15:05] <damrock> yeah i had this prblem with 3.2 on lts
[15:05] <RoyK> ok?
[15:05] <RoyK> reported a bug?
[15:06] <damrock> a lot of peoples reported it
[15:06] <RoyK> url?
[15:06] <patdk-lap> intel has lots of known driver issues that have not been fixed in years
[15:06] <patdk-lap> I dunno why you would trust intel to not have buggy drivers
[15:07] <damrock> i agree
[15:07] <damrock> but it works on windumb
[15:07] <patdk-lap> intels e1000 and iw drivers have known to have issues
[15:07] <damrock> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1018561
[15:07] <uvirtbot> Launchpad bug 1018561 in linux "e1000e needs updating due to 82574L keeps dropping RX packets" [Medium,Confirmed]
[15:07] <RoyK> that's interesting - I have rather a lot of machines with those cards
[15:08] <damrock> those "eeprom fix" didn't help
[15:08] <damrock> maybe some ethtool quirks in the nvram inserted or something
[15:09] <damrock> but i said if i use the drawring kernel my sas doesnt work anymore... thats pretty funny
[15:09] <RoyK> so, the nic works with 3.7, but there you can't find the controller?
[15:10] <damrock> well i get another nic at monday, im tired with this stuff
[15:11] <patdk-lap> what about just using 3.5 with backported modules?
[15:11] <patdk-lap> that is what I do to get a more stable wifi driver
[15:11] <damrock> good idea
[15:12] <patdk-lap> you could always also download the e1000e driver from intel and compile it yourself also
[15:13] <patdk-lap> royk, I have gone into scary territory for me, running my own build of illumos-gate on oi
[15:13] <patdk-lap> never built illumos kernel before
[15:14] <RoyK> hehe - does it work?
[15:14] <patdk-lap> spent almost all day yesterday getting it built
[15:14] <patdk-lap> hmm, the *debug* one wouldn't
[15:14] <patdk-lap> but non-debug boots
[15:14] <patdk-lap> have it on 3 machiens, the test build, my home
[15:14] <patdk-lap> and just shoved it into production
[15:15]  * RoyK has never built an illumos kernel neither
[15:16] <RoyK> why did you upgrade?
[15:16] <patdk-lap> nfs panic
[15:16] <RoyK> btw, what's the current oi status these days? "still not dead yet"?
[15:17] <RoyK> ouch
[15:17] <patdk-lap> nothing better than free an null pointer :)
[15:22] <damrock> just make install to compile the driver according to the manual... no depmod -a or something
[15:22] <patdk-lap> you should always depmod -a
[15:23] <patdk-lap> but that isn't a part of compiling the driver, that is part of installing the driver
[15:23] <damrock> weird instructions
[15:23] <RoyK> patdk-lap: seems gcc just ignores a free((void *)0)
[15:24] <patdk-lap> not sure about gcc, but I know libc in linux ignores it, and  Ithink also ignores anything random value you give it that wasn't malloc'd
[15:24] <RoyK> ok
[15:24] <patdk-lap> I don't think it was a free(NULL) as much as free(random) though
[15:25] <RoyK> just tried to free(random) - that segfaulted nicely
[15:25] <patdk-lap> :)
[15:25] <patdk-lap> might be one of the other malloc packages
[15:25] <patdk-lap> used many different ones
[15:26] <patdk-lap> https://www.illumos.org/issues/3449
[15:26] <patdk-lap> well, in this case it was a free(0)
[15:26] <patdk-lap> or some processing on a NULL pointer
[15:27] <patdk-lap> nothing better than single line bug fix's
[15:42] <damrock> ok module installed
[15:42] <damrock> just rmmod the module, then copy the new compiled module to the lib mod stuff and modprobe it
[15:44] <damrock> well, the error remains
[16:03] <RoyK> damrock: I saw a post about it with the error being the same even with 3.7.x
[16:23] <Fuzolan> The Message "Your BIOS is broken; DMA routed to ISOCH DMAR unit but no TLB space." should only lead to a performace drop or I'm wrong?
[16:24] <samba35> i have nokia 3500c phone i want to connect to internet using this phone ,how do i connect i tryed with wvdail but i get message on phone subcrib to packet data 1st and wvdail goes in redial attempt
[16:29] <RoyK> connecting to the net via a phone from a server?
[16:37] <damrock> royk whatever
[16:37] <RoyK> ?
[16:37] <damrock> i will buy another ethernet nic
[16:39] <damrock> just try to figure out a good nic
[16:51] <damrock> whats a recommended network nic for pcie x1?
[16:51] <patdk-lap> any desktop nic?
[16:51] <damrock> any?
[16:51] <patdk-lap> well, depending on performance
[16:51] <patdk-lap> intel, broadcom, realtek, ...
[16:52] <damrock> it should give me 120MB/s with 4 or 8k frames
[16:52] <patdk-lap> heh? no
[16:52] <damrock> for afp and nfs
[16:52] <patdk-lap> your lucky if you get 112MB/sec
[16:53] <patdk-lap> but I dunno about getting that kind of speed on a desktop class card though
[17:02] <RoyK> damrock: using jumboframes_
[17:02] <RoyK> ?
[17:35] <Yannik> hi guys, im not quite sure if im right here, but Im looking for help to configure my file rights for var/www correct. Im running apache on ubuntu with php as mod_fcgid. www-data user and my standarduser share a group "ftpuser", which is the group of var/www. Is it correct to set every directory now on 755 and every file on 664?
[17:39] <escott> Yannik, that is a strange permission set. why read exe on directors and read write on files in those directories
[17:39] <escott> Yannik, 775 664 would seem more normal
[17:40] <Yannik> sorry, that was a typo
[17:41] <RoyK> Yannik: better make them owned by root or some other user - allowing www-data write access to those files may open for some interesting issues if a bug is found in a php script or similar
[17:41] <Yannik> they are owned by root (except for the files uploaded by the standarduser)
[17:42] <Yannik> but i could change that via proftpd too
[17:42] <Yannik> I thought putting them in the same group (ftpuser) the too users (standarduser and www-data) would be fine
[17:43] <TheLordOfTime> agreed with RoyK on the www-data write access
[17:43] <TheLordOfTime> (sorry, late to the convo ;P)
[17:45] <Yannik> currently files have "- r w - r - - r - -" and directories have "drwxr-xr-x"
=== frojnd_ is now known as frojnd
[18:28] <frojnd> Hi there :)
[19:01] <TheLordOfTime> can someone be kind enough to suggest to me some kind of run-of-the-mill iptables rules that allow for some ICMP stuff?
[19:15] <patdk-lap> TheLordOfTime, something like:
[19:15] <TheLordOfTime> on campus network i'm curious whether they're trying to ping me or something, i
[19:16] <TheLordOfTime> 'm running in a non-restrictive firewall mode
[19:16] <patdk-lap> iptables -A INPUT -t icmp -m icmptype 3 code 4 -j ACCEPT
[19:16] <TheLordOfTime> which is dangerous, hence the info request :P
[19:16] <patdk-lap> iptables -A INPUT -t icmp -m icmptype 11 -j ACCEPT
[19:17] <patdk-lap> those two are required for ANY ip traffic to work
[19:17] <TheLordOfTime> -m icmptype  <-- errors out
[19:17] <patdk-lap> hmm
[19:18] <patdk-lap> ah
[19:18] <patdk-lap> iptables -A INPUT -t icmp-type 3/4 -j ACCEPT
[19:19] <TheLordOfTime> which one allows pings/echos?
[19:19] <patdk-lap> iptables -A INPUT -p 1 --icmp-type 11 -j ACCEPT
[19:19] <TheLordOfTime> i think this network checks to see if you're online using that.
[19:19] <patdk-lap> iptables -A INPUT -p 1 --icmp-type 3/4 -j ACCEPT
[19:19] <patdk-lap> nope
[19:19] <patdk-lap> those allow pmtu to work
[19:19] <TheLordOfTime> *sigh*
[19:19] <patdk-lap> I said REQUIRED, ping is optional
[19:19] <TheLordOfTime> i will need ping
[19:19] <TheLordOfTime> as well :p
[19:19] <patdk-lap> I believe ping is 8
[19:19] <patdk-lap> iptables -A INPUT -p 1 --icmp-type 8 -j ACCEPT
[19:22] <TheLordOfTime> okay, lets see if this works
[19:22] <TheLordOfTime> because my overly restrictive ruleset was causing me to not be able to be on the network
[19:22] <TheLordOfTime> so... :P
[19:22] <patdk-lap> forget doing iptables manually, and use shorewall :)

[20:32] <Fuzolan> The Message "Your BIOS is broken; DMA routed to ISOCH DMAR unit but no TLB space." should only lead to a performace drop or I'm wrong?
[20:41] <Nahita> Hey guys, I just got my 1st server. And was wonder about dynamic DNS. Any specefic ones you recomend?
[20:47] <virusuy> Nahita: dyndns ?
[20:48] <virusuy> no-ip
[20:48] <Nahita> ok, thnx. I also noticed there are free ones. So why would I pay for one?
[20:52] <TheLordOfTime> not dyndns
[20:52] <TheLordOfTime> dyndns stopped their free service recently
[20:52] <TheLordOfTime> those who still had free ones keep their free ones
[20:59] <Spanky100> I got a free one for my pop that works with a D-link router.  Though I think it will only work with D-Link routers...

[21:02] <Nahita> hehe, but whats the diffirence between those you pay for and the free ones?
[21:19] <frojnd> Hi there, is there a way to backup iptables rules before I try and make changes in case I mess something up?
[21:20] <shauno> frojnd: iptables-save >file and iptables-restore <file "work for me (tm)"  (no space before either hyphen)
[21:21] <frojnd> shauno: what if I don't have itpables-save? I only have iptables and iptables-restore
[21:22] <frojnd> Is there another way around?
[21:33] <dingo311> everytime my server resarts the router gives it ip x.x.x.103. this is via network cable. all my settings are from befor i had the server and the router near enough to connect so i was using wifi for sometime. it had ip x.x.x.102, so all my settings use this ip. i have configured my router to use the 102 ip but have to run sudo dhclient eth0 to get anything to connect. how do i get the router/server to use the 102 ip default?

[22:00] <PeterGriffin>  dingo311 you can do this http://pastebin.com/dK2cfnGW
[22:10] <dingo311> PeterGriffin: not sure of line 9
[22:17] <PeterGriffin> it is still the router ip
[22:30] <dingo311> PeterGriffin: that was a no go. i can pastebin the interfaces file if you need
[22:31] <PeterGriffin> do it
[22:33] <PeterGriffin> dingo311: your router connects you to internet, right?
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[22:34] <dingo311> PeterGriffin: yea, not saying i got everything in the file coorect. im pretty noobish. i can ping the outside ip tho.
[22:36] <PeterGriffin> so what is the sitoation now?
[22:38] <dingo311> i rebooted the server, it didnt connect. I got it to connect.
[22:39] <PeterGriffin> paste interfaces file
[22:40] <PeterGriffin> and did you change the resolve file
[22:40] <dingo311> the wifi had its own ip and mac. i turned off the hardware switch, plugged in an ethernet cable. got a new local ip and mac. i know how to update my router with dhcp reservation, but evry reboot it reverts back to the old ip, the 192.168.0.103
[22:40] <dingo311> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1578174/     <---interfaces, did not change resolve files
[22:43] <PeterGriffin> what's the router ip
[22:43] <dingo311> the local? 192.168.0.1
[22:43] <PeterGriffin> you should write it in th gateway line
[22:44] <PeterGriffin> change network to 192.168.0.0
[22:44] <PeterGriffin> then edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/base
[22:44] <PeterGriffin> inside write nameserver <your router IP>
[22:45] <dingo311> with <>?
[22:45] <PeterGriffin> without
[22:45] <dingo311> ok, anyway to check without a reboot?
[22:46] <PeterGriffin> sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[22:46] <PeterGriffin> thet should do it
[22:48] <dingo311> Running /etc/init.d/networking restart is deprecated because it may not enable again some interfaces * Reconfiguring network interfaces...
[22:50] <PeterGriffin> so did it restarted the interface
[22:50] <PeterGriffin> what ifconfig  says
[22:51] <dingo311> no
[22:51] <dingo311> hanging on last part
[22:52] <dingo311> says failed to bring up eth0
[22:52] <PeterGriffin> sudo ifconfig eth0 up
[22:55] <PeterGriffin> it should bring it up
[22:56] <PeterGriffin> or restart it again
[22:57] <dingo311> by it you ,ean whole system?
[22:59] <PeterGriffin> yea, in the second sentence  :)
[22:59] <PeterGriffin> but
[23:00] <PeterGriffin> you shoud first try sudo ifconfid eth0 up
[23:00] <PeterGriffin> ifconfig*
[23:01] <PeterGriffin> even try first sudo ifconfig eth0 down and then up

[23:14] <PeterGriffin> dingo311: did eth0 go up
[23:15] <saltmiser> PeterGriffin and dingo311 are the same person
[23:15] <saltmiser> xD

[23:54] <Vasa> hello I have a problem that a partition '/dev/xvda1/ is mounted as root / as read only and it makes any changes impossible, how do i go about getting it to the normal fully read/write access for root?
[23:54] <Vasa> i tried the command mount -o remount,rw /partition/identifier /mount/point
[23:54] <Vasa> mount -o remount,rw /dev/xvda1 /
[23:55] <Vasa> however it says that "mount: you must specify the filesystem type"
[23:57] <escott> Vasa, for a remount?
[23:58] <Vasa> yes I want to remount the /
[23:58] <Vasa> as a read/write filesystem
[23:58] <escott> but it shouldnt be asking for the filesystem type on a remount unless something is seriously wrong
[23:58] <escott> are you in a busybox shell?
[23:58] <Vasa> yes it does but what filesystem should i provide
[23:59] <Vasa> i am controlling it via a SSH
[23:59] <Vasa> root
