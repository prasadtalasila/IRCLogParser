[12:40] <jirido> Hi.
[12:45] <jirido> I wonder if someone her would know how to get rid of some of them mountable partitions that shows up in left pane in Pcmanfm..? I have set them in fstab to automount in different locations during boot time and find their representations there annoying and cluttering .. I would like though removable driver to show up! :)
[12:46] <jirido> err.. removable drives to show up!

[16:37] <cab___> anyone have experience with a LIGHT browser, seems chrome is using lots of RAM and cpu
[16:44] <fruktkaka> Heya lads.
[16:44] <fruktkaka> I'm new to lubuntu.. can I with ease unet myself a copy and boot it from usb?
[16:56] <cab___> the browsers candidate are:
[16:56] <cab___> arora - dillo - Dwb - Luakit - netsurf-gtk
[17:01] <cab___> midori also
[17:05] <cab___> dillo is hmmm too lighweight
[17:39] <wxl> cab___: try xxxterm aka xombrero
[17:51] <cab___> wxl:  thx for the pointer
=== Guest92919 is now known as mh0
[17:54] <wxl> cab___: np. i'll warn you it's a bit obtuse (like vim is) but it works really well.
[17:56] <cab___> xombrero work in terminal right?
[17:58] <cab___> wxl:  hmm maybe too minimal
[18:01] <wxl> cab___: nope, not terminal
[18:01] <wxl> cab___: and it only seems minimal. it's pretty darn full-featured.
[18:08] <cab___> I've downloaded v1.3.1
[18:10] <cab___> but it says 1.4 was released
[18:10] <cab___> *can't find it
[18:12] <cab___> https://opensource.conformal.com/snapshots/xombrero/
[18:12] <cab___> ok
[22:40] <JDude> Which do you prefer: weechat or irssi?
[22:46] <wxl> JDude: they're both good but i sure like vertical and horizontal window splits in weechat
[22:52] <JDude> wxl: I
[22:52] <JDude> wxl: I'd have to agree with you.
[22:53] <JDude> And the colors kind of swung me over :P
[22:53] <wxl> heh figures. pretty lights and all.
[22:53] <Unit193> !poll
[22:53] <ubottu> Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[22:54] <Unit193> Both are good clients, scripting seems to be better in weechat as more languages are supported.
[22:54] <wxl> â€¦because we're so drenched in traffic.
[22:54] <JDude> unit193: sorry... ? I was sort of just starting a conversation.
[22:54] <Unit193> wxl: Nah, it's more to stop wars in general, you know I like irssi better. :P
[22:55] <JDude> unit193: and I know there is not one that is objectively 'better'
[22:55] <Unit193> JDude: I'd recommend running it in tmux or screen.
[22:55] <JDude> Ooh why do you like irssi more? (just curious)
[22:56] <wxl> +1 tmux
[22:56] <Unit193> Heh, I use and like screen better. :P
[22:56] <JDude> is tmux a terminal emulator?
[22:56] <Unit193> JDude: I'm used to it, it has the features I need, it "acts" differently and makes more sense to me.
[22:56] <wxl> tmux & screen, depending on which you choose, are your terminal's best friend
[22:57] <wxl> i have to admit there's a lot about weechat that doesn't intuitively make sense to me and so i've not fully made the transition to it
[22:57] <Unit193> If X crashes for example and you actually run irssi/weechat on the same computer, you can still access them in a VT.
[22:57] <wxl> tmux stands for "terminal multiplexer" if that helps it make more sense
[22:58] <JDude> oh okay. I see. I use terminal a ton, so I should look into that.
[22:58] <wxl> it's a windowing system so to speak
[22:59] <JDude> thanks for the suggestion.
[23:00] <JDude> I just revived an old netbook last week so I'm still learning linux. but i find myself on this computer more than my mac
[23:00] <wxl> yeah i hear that
[23:00] <wxl> we wouldn't have a mac now but my wife insisted on it. i was all set to have a nice linux machine.
[23:01] <wxl> the thing pisses me off because it's unix, not linux, and a rather funky, perverted version at that
[23:01] <mysteriousdarren> JDude: keep fighting the good fight, and if you need help ask.
[23:02] <mysteriousdarren> :)
[23:04] <mysteriousdarren> JDude: were you the one asking about microsoft office?
[23:06] <JDude> mysteriousdarren: i was :)
[23:07] <JDude> mysteriousdarren: I installed wine fine, but I can't get MS office because I don't want/have a paid license.
[23:07] <wxl> JDude: have you tried libreoffice for whatever you're trying to do? it's fab,.
[23:08] <wxl> i will say that abiword is pretty darn good but not 100%
[23:08] <mysteriousdarren> wxl: sometimes, I have it install as well as abiword. Still office 2007 is rock solid on wine
[23:09] <JDude> wxl: yeah i have L.O. and I can edit docs, but when I reopen them on my mac it says the file is corrupted and needs to be resotred. Then I have to reselect the dropbox folder and rename the doc. so it's a minor issue.
[23:09] <mysteriousdarren> `installed
[23:09] <wxl> i haven't used office in so long it's unbelievable. not even on machines that have windows :)
[23:09] <wxl> which i think is a testament to how great libreoffice is.
[23:10] <JDude> mysteriousdarren: do you know approximately how much for a lisense of word?
[23:11] <JDude> wxl: libre offic is nice, and very similiar to word in almost everyway. the only thing i miss is language spell checking and the formula editor.
[23:11] <mysteriousdarren> JDude: are you in college?
[23:11] <JDude> yes.
[23:11] <mysteriousdarren> at my local private its 20
[23:12] <JDude> mysteriousdarren: okay, thanks. That's not too bad.
[23:12] <Unit193> You should be able to get "starter" too.
[23:12] <mysteriousdarren> Unit193: have you tried it?
[23:12] <JDude> unit193: That would be ideal. how?
[23:14] <JDude> I only
[23:14] <JDude> I have it on my windows 7 starter partition of this netbook.
[23:14] <Unit193> mysteriousdarren: I hate the ribbon, LO is my choice.
[23:14] <JDude> but windows runs painfully slow and i can't stand it
[23:15] <JDude> unit193: do you know how to install it with wine?
[23:15] <Unit193> JDude: I'd assume the same as normal office.
[23:15] <Unit193> I have no MSO in wine.
[23:15] <JDude> unit193: okay I'll have to go do some research. thanks for the suggestion
[23:16] <mysteriousdarren> LO is nice, just 07 is sold on wine
[23:18] <JDude> '07 MSO? or LO?
[23:18] <JDude> cuz LO is free on the software center
[23:19] <mysteriousdarren> Microsoft Office 2007
[23:19] <mysteriousdarren> use LO if you can
[23:19] <Unit193> JDude: I didn't recommend it, just an idea.  http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/en_US/cat/ThemeID.27509700/categoryID.37826100 was another link.  Starter has a small ad on the side, IIRC.
[23:22] <mysteriousdarren> JDude: Yes, but at the college bookstores its usually cheaper. Just a thought, some give it for free
[23:24] <JDude> I'll have to go searching and see if we have it there.
[23:25] <JDude> Yeah $99 is a little steep for this little laptop, though I love it so :)
[23:27] <mysteriousdarren> id rather get a ssd for that much than office
[23:28] <JDude> mysteriousdarren: ssd's are so nice. I actually upgraded my macbook about a year ago to a ssd. It feels like I bought a new one :P
[23:28] <JDude> And microsoft has apparently discontinued the microsoft starter...
[23:29] <JDude> so they don't have a download up.
[23:32] <BlitzHere> HI
[23:32] <BlitzHere> I have a P4 1.6 Ghz computer with 512 MB of RAM and I want to install lubuntu 12.10. My CD drive stopped working and my BIOS doesn't like USB flash drives. Since I had GRUB installed, I get the kernel and initrd.gz for 12.10 and out them into /boot and followed instructions in the wiki. However, the installer doesn't seem to recognize my ethernet card. My card is a Realtek 8139d, which has had it's drivers put into the linux ker
