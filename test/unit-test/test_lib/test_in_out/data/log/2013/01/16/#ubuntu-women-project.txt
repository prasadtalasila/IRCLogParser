[02:41] <Cheri703> em likes to show up, make comments similar to what she did, and then disappear. trying to mock people who are offended by sexist things.
[02:42] <elky> yep
[02:42] <elky> not so much to mock
[02:42] <IdleOne> I would add she also likes to read logs and then come back later and complain about things
[02:42] <Cheri703> well, stirring things up
[02:42]  * Cheri703 is kind of out of i
[02:42] <Cheri703> t
[02:42] <elky> rather to get people all worked up and then poke at the nerves
[02:43] <elky> so people lash out at her and then she can claim to be a victim
[02:43] <elky> and get ALL THE ATTENTIONS
[02:43] <IdleOne> intentional misinterpretation is what she likes to do
[02:44] <Cheri703> IdleOne: ++
[02:44] <elky> and mark is going to do the opposite of helping things
[02:44] <elky> but that at least is not intentional.
[03:06] <elky> If she pm's any of you to try get you to join her channel, let us know. She also uses these discussions to make excuses to PM people for that purpose
[03:19]  * elky reads and facepalms
[03:30] <elky> She definitely has ALL the attentions now
[03:35] <Cheri703> yeah :/
[03:36] <Cheri703> the whole "my experience with ubuntu communities is that dissent isn't allowed" well, dissent that is "haha, I am the only right one and if you try to say otherwise you're *censoring* me!"
[03:37] <elky> yeah.
[03:38] <Cheri703> I'd seen the "neutral point of view" statement and was going to ask if em was libertarian, then saw it mentioned and went "OF COURSE"
[03:39] <elky> has she mentioned the words "town hall" yet?
[03:39] <elky> or "city hall" or whatever
[03:39] <Cheri703> not sure, I skimmed
[03:39] <Cheri703> we should start an em appearance bingo card
[03:39] <elky> yeah, i'm scared to do more than skim
[03:42] <elky> i don't want to jinx it... but...
