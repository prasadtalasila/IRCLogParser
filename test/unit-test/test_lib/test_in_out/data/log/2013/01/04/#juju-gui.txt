[13:48] <bac> hi bcsaller
[13:57]  * benji goes to make some much-needed coffee.
[14:14] <bcsaller> bac: whats up?
[14:15] <bac> bcsaller: i'm trying to figure out how mouse events on the canvas are handled for pan and zoom wrt bug 1091616.  would you have a moment for a chat?
[14:15] <_mup_> Bug #1091616: Unusual drag/zoom behaviour <regression> <juju-gui:In Progress by bac> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1091616 >
[14:18] <bcsaller> bac: I've been looking at that as well, I was calling this a regression, but its a pre-existing issue really. The rect that is pan/zoomable doesn't scale with all the size changes like it should leaving some areas un-accounted for
[14:19] <bac> bcsaller: can we talk in about 5 minutes?
[14:19] <bcsaller> bac: yeah, I need a couple minutes as well
[14:19] <bcsaller> its noisy here now

[17:00] <gary_poster> hey teknico I don't have time for a full test review but can do a code review of your branch now.  Is that sufficient, given that Francesco and you have already run it through its paces?
