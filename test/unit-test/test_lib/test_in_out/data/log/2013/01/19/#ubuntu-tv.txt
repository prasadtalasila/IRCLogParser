[00:43] <PasqualeIV> Hello all -- I was planning on playing with UbuntuTV this evening/weekend.  I wanted to confirm before diving in: Ubuntu 11 is required (as the wiki suggests)?
[00:45] <mhall119> PasqualeIV: I think bobweaver has a PPA with it working on 12.04
[00:46] <mhall119> but I'm not sure where that is
[00:48] <PasqualeIV> mhall119: awesome -- I'll look into that.  and, (sorry for my ignorance):  CEC support, would 11 or 12 favor its eventual support?  [if I understand correctly, CEC is not yet working unless you have some usb adapter]
[00:48] <mhall119> I'm not sure what CEC is
[00:51] <PasqualeIV> oh man, you gotta check it out -- in lame terms: its a communication protocol over HDMI that enables devices to talk to each other.  The aspect that has me very excited is that it would allow my TV remote to send commands to my UbuntuTV box.  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Control#CEC]
[01:08] <PasqualeIV> mhall119: thanks for the help!  I'm going to go offline for a short bit.  bbl.
[02:12] <tgm4883> mhall119, does this make sense to you "AttributeError: 'Scope' object has no attribute 'queue'"
[02:13] <mhall119> tgm4883: using Singlet or gi.repository?
[02:13] <tgm4883> oh wait, nm
[02:13] <tgm4883> typo :/
[02:13] <mhall119> ok
[02:14] <tgm4883> I do have a question though
[02:14] <tgm4883> self.scope.search_in_global = True
[02:14] <tgm4883> Does that mean it should be searchable via the main dash search?
[02:19] <mhall119> yeah
[02:20] <tgm4883> hmm
[02:20] <tgm4883> doesn't seem to be working for me
[02:20] <tgm4883> the results show up in the main videos lens, but not the main dash lens
[03:29] <bobweaver> I QUIT AT ALL THIS Nice LIES by the WAY see you in HELL !!
=== rsalveti_ is now known as rsalveti
[21:50] <tgm4883> mhall119, where do we files bugs against examples on developer.ubuntu.com?
[21:51] <tgm4883> I mean, I can't be the first person to be like "odd, the example code fails a basic python test"
