[14:29] <bazhang> nice!
[14:29] <bazhang> that is a SUpreme hack
[14:44] <bazhang> hi LinSve
[14:44] <LinSve> Hi, kind of new to this irc stuff. No chat window I take it.
[14:44] <bazhang> whats the need for an op there LinSve
[14:45] <LinSve> Hi, I am a student of Link√∂ping University. We have a course on open source operating systems and have been told to use Ubuntu. There seems to be a problem with your IRC channel though.
[14:45] <bazhang> which is?
[14:45] <LinSve> Do I need to make some kind of Ubuntu account?
[14:45] <bazhang> no
[14:45] <LinSve> Right now I am sitting in the school library on my laptop using my BF phone as a hot-spot.
[14:46] <LinSve> Nobody from the entire student block can enter Ubuntu. The students who live here and took this class before us said they had the same problem. All the guys started using so called shell accounts to get around the problem. I have never been in #Ubuntu before.
[14:46] <LinSve> Why can't I log it?
[14:46] <Myrtti> well, it's a bit difficult to troubleshoot if we don't know your original blocked IP
[14:46] <LinSve> blocked?
[14:47] <Myrtti> and if it is the network altogether or if you can't access #ubuntu but can other channels
[14:47] <LinSve>  I have never hacked anybody or done anything wrong.
[14:47] <Myrtti> well I assume blocked
[14:47] <Myrtti> banned
[14:47] <Myrtti> again, details would be nice
[14:47] <LinSve> How do I see what the IP is ?
[14:47] <Myrtti> what message do you get when you try to connect and what ip address you're connecting from
[14:48] <LinSve> Let me call home and ask them. One sec
[14:49] <LinSve> Got this on a sms. Not sure if its is what you need. 85.224.0.0/13
[14:49] <LinSve> Is that the IP?
[14:50] <LinSve> Myrtti was that right?
[14:51] <Myrtti> possibly, I'm surprised though that the whois doesn't say it's the university network of Sweden, which I assume Sweden has
[14:51] <LinSve> Its the student houses
[14:52] <Myrtti> well I can't see anything for that ip address
[14:52] <LinSve> It says banned from what I was just told.
[14:53] <LinSve> but the other people in my class are all using so called shell accounts.
[14:53] <LinSve> Think that is silly.
[14:53] <Myrtti> using shell accounts have other benefits
[14:53] <LinSve> I just want to finish the course.
[14:54] <LinSve> Don't care about all the geek things the guys are doing.
[14:55] <Myrtti> well there's nothing for that ip address that blocks it atleast on the channel level
[14:56] <LinSve> Oh, just got told our IP span is 85.228.12.0-85.228.207.255
[14:56] <ikonia> that's a net range
[14:56] <ikonia> why would you get a net range sent as an SMS ??
[14:56] <LinSve> and we use a router in each house.
[14:57] <LinSve> I am using a 3G phone as a hot spot since I am studying
[14:57] <Myrtti> there's nothing on that range either
[14:57] <LinSve> and I needed to talk to somebody here too.
[14:57] <Myrtti> are you sure the problem is only for joining #ubuntu?
[14:57] <Myrtti> have you tried other channels and if so which?
[14:57] <LinSve> Only ubuntu from what I hear
[14:57] <LinSve> this one
[14:58] <LinSve> well I am on the 3G so that does not say much.
[14:58] <ikonia> LinSve: 1.) log off your hotspot 2.) connect using your normal network 3.) join #ubuntu-ops
[14:58] <ikonia> we can then try to resolve this
[14:58] <LinSve> Thank you ikonia
[14:58] <LinSve> It will take me about 15 min to walk home. Will you be here then?
[14:59] <Myrtti> we've been here for years.
[14:59] <ikonia> someone will be active in the channel
[14:59] <LinSve> ikonia thanks for being helpful. Ill be back in about 15-20 min.
[15:41] <bazhang> LinSven, hi
[15:42] <LinSven> Hello, I am back. Sorry it took a while to install mIRC.
[15:42] <LinSven> I did not have IRC on my home computer. Ubuntu is starting to seem like a better OS to have even at home!
[15:43] <LinSven> OK I tired to login to #ubuntu but I get what the other get too
[15:43] <LinSven> I took a picture to show you what it looks like.
[15:43] <LinSven> http://i45.tinypic.com/1zfug7c.png
[15:45] <LinSven> BTW think you bazhang for waiting for me. I am kind of new to all this "open source" stuff and there are a lot of guys here at the student house that are not all that happy to help out =(
[15:47] <LinSven> All I hear is "Google it". At time much worse things about reading a * manual.
[15:47] <Pici> LinSven: Just give us a sec to figure this out.
[15:47] <LinSven> Thank you.
[15:52] <Pici> LinSven: You should be able to join #ubuntu now
[15:52] <LinSven> Thank you so much Pici
[15:53] <LinSven> yay it works =)
[15:53] <Pici> yay
[16:03] <bazhang> <drifter> i replaced ubuntu with earphones
[16:05] <IdleOne> LinSven: if there is nothing else please /part this channel
[17:30] <jsec> Hey I wasn't aware that script automatically ran like that. It's been disabled. Sorry about that.
[17:31] <Pici> jsec: Sure, no problem. I've removed the ban.
[17:31] <jsec> Thanks.
