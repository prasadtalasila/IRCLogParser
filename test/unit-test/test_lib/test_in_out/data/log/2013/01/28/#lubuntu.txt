[01:25] <genoobie> hey
[01:29] <wxl> yo
[01:34] <genoobie> wxl you still here?
[01:35] <wxl> genoobie: in and out, yep
[01:36] <genoobie> just a quick question
[01:36] <genoobie> I have a hdd with three partitions an old install of xubuntu which I am going to replace with lubuntu
[01:36] <genoobie> I downloaded the alternate install
[01:36] <genoobie> I am at the setup of the partition and I don't know what to make the "bootable flag"
[01:37] <wxl> well i wouldn't mess with it unless you plan on booting from that partition
[01:39] <genoobie> I am using a boot loader
[01:39] <genoobie> I think grub
[01:39] <wxl> right
[01:39] <wxl> and one of the partitions is going to be the bootable one
[01:40] <genoobie> oh, hrm
[01:40] <genoobie> probably not sda3
[01:40] <genoobie> ?
[01:41] <genoobie> oh well here goes nothing

[02:51] <genoobie> urgh
[02:51] <genoobie> okay I finished my lubuntu installation
[02:51] <genoobie> but the login screen is all "borked"
[02:52] <genoobie> i.e. there's something wrong with "X"
=== l057c0d3r_ is now known as l057c0d3r
[03:29] <billytwowilly> genoobie, you gotta give us a bit more than "it's all borked"
[06:01] <wxl> genoobie_: blank screen? goofy colors? no x at all?
[07:55] <Hyperiant> I have a boot drive on another computer that I want to partition and turn into a bootable drive for another computer on the network; can I do that?

[10:11] <Hyperiant> My power button doesn't do anything when pressed; any ideas?
[10:15] <Hyperiant> :<
[10:24] <Hyperiant> Anybody know how to fix a power button not doing anything in latest lubuntu?
[10:39] <Hyperiant> On further investigation, the problem seems to be the "Ask" function in lubuntu
[10:40] <Hyperiant> How do I make the "Ask" option on power press actually ask me what to do?
[10:41] <Hyperiant> ...hello?
[12:26] <dokg> hey
[12:35] <dokg> I cannot get past the login screen

[12:35] <dokg> and I'm again on login screen :'(

[16:32] <negaduck> hi! how to disable desktop?
[16:34] <inductiveload> negaduck: disable the desktop? how do you mean?
[16:36] <negaduck> i mean there is a panel with taskbar etc, and there is a desktop under applications that contains folder and docs icons. How to disable it so it wouldn't hang in memory?
[16:37] <inductiveload> i still don't quite follow you, do you mean you don't want PCManFM to mamage the desktop?
[16:39] <negaduck> inductiveload: probably yes
[16:39] <negaduck> how to disable it
[16:41] <inductiveload> when you say "hang in memeory", do you mean something is literally hanging, or you just don't want to use the ram?
[16:42] <negaduck> i'd like to free some ram, i've got only 512Mb here
[16:43] <inductiveload> pcman --desktop-off
[16:43] <inductiveload> urp
[16:43] <inductiveload> pcmanfm --desktop-off
[16:47] <negaduck> great. But how to configure it to be disabled forever?
[16:47] <negaduck> i relogged in and it started up again
[16:52] <inductiveload> if you want to do it globally, try editing /etc/xdg/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart and removing either 1) the "--desktop" from the pcmanfm line or 2) the whole line
[16:55] <negaduck> inductiveload: many thanks
[16:56] <inductiveload> no problem
[16:56] <inductiveload> you could also get rid of xscreensaver if you are that tight on ram
[16:57] <inductiveload> you'd lose locking, though
[16:59] <negaduck> right. xautolock will work for me
[18:06] <ioria> i run lubuntu 12.04 (but installed gnome also) and  i cannot open file url in gnome- terminal (URL=file:///), but i can in gnome session. help please
[18:33] <diamonds> where are the requirements listed
[18:33] <diamonds> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Lubuntu#System_requirements
[18:33] <diamonds> I don't see them here.. am I looking wrong?
[20:26] <billytwowilly> if I have a multimonitor  setup is it possible to keep 1 monitor the same on all desktops? i.e I play movies in my second monitor and want the movies to always be on no matter which desktop I'm on but I have a lot of stuff to do in the other monitor that would be easier if I could use multiple desktops.
[20:29] <inductiveload> billytwowilly: so you mean switch only half your desktop?
[20:31] <inductiveload> i don't _think_ you can do that easily (though I could be wrong). Another direction to go in, if you want to dedicate an output to movies is to have separate X displays, though I'm not sure how you go about that
[20:32] <inductiveload> alternatively, two computers and synergy ;-)
[20:33] <inductiveload> sorry, i know that's not really helpful
[20:35] <billytwowilly> somewhat helpful. I figured it wasn't possible. I already have another computer running synergy. but that's the windows work computer..
[20:35] <billytwowilly> That's got its own 4 monitors

[22:09] <technologic> hi
[22:44] <Auslin> Ohh long time since I met this chanel :)
[22:46] <iggy_> Hello all :)
[22:47] <Auslin> Hello
[22:47] <iggy_> Ihave a problem installing RatPoison  on Lubuntu. The installation works good, but RatPoison isn't listed in the logging screen. I've searched for a file to edit in /etc/X11 but didn"t found anything relevant
[22:49] <Auslin> let me do a quick research
[22:49] <wxl> i'm pretty sure you have to create a new session file for it
[22:50] <Auslin> iggy_: Here you go http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1333224
[22:50] <Auslin> :P
[22:51] <wxl> may not work given that it's ubunt…
[22:52] <iggy_> wow great, it seems good, thank you
[22:52] <Auslin> Sorry my fault
[22:52] <Auslin> if you want to try if is installed correctly you can use ctrl+alt+F1  then sudo xinit -e ratpoison
[22:52] <iggy_> i feel stupid i didn't found it :)
[22:52] <iggy_> let me trythat live
[22:53] <wxl> actually probably will work. i think both lubuntu and ubuntu use lightdm now. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LightDM
[22:53] <iggy_> "server already active" for solution with Ctrl+alt+f1
[22:54] <Auslin> you can use other F's
[22:54] <Auslin> You know why I love LXDE  it is XDG-compliant, that let me not get that crazy while using other OS like BSD :)
[22:57] <Auslin> Well, have to go see you people !
[22:58] <IggY-Desktop> Hey, i'm the guy that ws having pb with ratpoison
[22:58] <IggY-Desktop> the /usr/share/ new xsession file worked
[22:58] <^Phantom2^> I am unable to update my system due to a 404 error.
[22:58] <IggY-Desktop> thank's a lot
[22:58] <IggY-Desktop> have a good night
[22:58] <^Phantom2^> It tells me to check my connection when trying to reach Failed to fetch http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/u/upstart/upstart_1.5-0ubuntu7_i386.deb 404  Not Found [IP: 91.189.91.15 80]
[22:58] <wxl> ^Phantom2^: 404 on what url?
[22:59] <wxl> exit
[22:59] <wxl> oops
[22:59] <wxl> yep that's a 404 alright
[23:00] <Unit193> ^Phantom2^: You do a sudo apt-get update  first?
[23:00] <^Phantom2^> i can try that
[23:00] <^Phantom2^> I usually just run update manager when it comes up
[23:00] <wxl> looking at the upper level directory, you find upstart_1.5-0ubuntu7.2_i386.deb and upstart_1.5-0ubuntu9_i386.deb but not upstart_1.5-0ubuntu7_i386.deb
[23:00] <wxl> which suggests to me an update is in order
[23:01] <wxl> the index is looking for something that's not there
[23:01] <Unit193> Yep, that's why I said what I said, sources lists were outdated.
[23:01] <^Phantom2^> sudo apt-get update finished
[23:02] <wxl> now sudo apt-get upgrade
[23:02] <Unit193> Now  sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  should install the new one.
[23:02] <^Phantom2^> oh?
[23:02] <^Phantom2^> I tried installing the latest to this laptop already, and it seems the kernel doesn't support this hardware anymore
[23:02] <wxl> more or less the same thing
[23:03] <wxl> that seems…  surprising.
[23:03] <^Phantom2^> older laptop
[23:03] <^Phantom2^> pavilion ze5300
[23:03] <wxl> what is the processor?
[23:04] <^Phantom2^> Pentium 4
[23:04] <Flazer> even so, I think it should be supported...
[23:04] <^Phantom2^> hm
[23:05] <Flazer> don't take my word for it, i'll wait for one of the others to chime in
[23:05] <wxl> yeah i concur
[23:05] <^Phantom2^> yeah, i'll hold back for now
[23:05] <wxl> it should be no problem
[23:05] <wxl> i'd move forward with the upgrade
[23:05] <wxl> we've installed lubuntu on p2s and celerons
[23:05] <Flazer> right
[23:05] <^Phantom2^> i had to get the previous version CD for it to work
[23:06] <Flazer> a p4 should be more supported than those others
[23:06] <Unit193> ^Phantom2^: Real quick,  grep pae /proc/cpuinfo
[23:07] <^Phantom2^> i get a flags output
[23:07] <^Phantom2^> with pae in pink
[23:07] <^Phantom2^> flags		: fpu vme de pse tsc msr pae mce cx8 mtrr pge mca cmov pat pse36 clflush dts acpi mmx fxsr sse sse2 ss ht tm pbe up pebs bts cid xtpr
[23:08] <Unit193> Then the PAE kernel should work.  Also, dist-upgrade will not upgrade to the new version of Lubuntu.
[23:08] <^Phantom2^> hm okay
[23:09] <^Phantom2^> Unit193, maybe the LiveCD didn't have the kernel I needed?
[23:09] <^Phantom2^> this thing used to run windows XP (horribly) which is why I made the switch, and couldn't be happier for doing so
[23:12] <Unit193> "dist-upgrade in addition to performing the function of upgrade, also intelligently handles changing dependencies with new versions of packages; apt-get has a "smart" conflict resolution system, and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages at the expense of less important ones if necessary. The dist-upgrade command may therefore remove some packages. The /etc/apt/sources.list file contains a list of locations from which to ...
[23:12] <Unit193> ... retrieve desired package files. See also apt_preferences(5) for a mechanism for overriding the general settings for individual packages."
[23:14] <^Phantom2^> is that similar to a distro upgrade?
[23:15] <^Phantom2^> i've done distro upgrades before and am comfortable doing so, but nervous because the latest version of this distro didn't install due to kernel issues
[23:15] <Unit193> Nope.
