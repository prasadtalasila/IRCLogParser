[08:40] <Akshay> module "QtQuick" version 2.0 is not installed       import QtQuick 2.0
[08:40] <tsimpson> you need Qt5 for QtQuick 2.0
[08:41] <Akshay> i follwed all the steps given in ubuntu site
[08:41] <Akshay> i did nothing new
[08:41] <Akshay> what should i donow?
[08:43] <tsimpson> you can either install Qt5.0 from http://qt-project.org/downloads or you can write a QtQuick 1.0 project
[08:44] <Akshay> ok tet me try
[08:45] <Akshay> by the way i run the commad that is given on the ubuntu wesite which i think installs QT5,
[08:45] <Akshay> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:canonical-qt5-edgers/qt5-beta1 && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install qt5-meta-full && echo 'export PATH=/opt/qt5/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
[08:45] <tsimpson> ah, well that should pull Qt5 then
[08:45] <Akshay> yeah thats what

[08:47] <Akshay> I'm trying to view that tools->external thing
[08:50] <tsimpson> did you set it to use qmlscene?
[08:51] <tsimpson> I don't have a Qt5 setup on this box, so I can't really test the instructions right now
[08:51] <Akshay> ok,
[08:51] <Akshay> I'm trying to setup qmlscene
