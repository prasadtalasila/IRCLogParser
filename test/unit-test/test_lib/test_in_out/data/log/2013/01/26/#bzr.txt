[23:31] <muep> I got myself a copy of a project with bzr co and made some changes to it which I would like to send back upstream. In case I do not wish to create a new public repository, what would be the most appropriate way to get a patch file that I could send?
[23:34] <muep> just running bzr diff produces at least a plain patch, but is there anything which'd maybe let me commit my work first and then send patches with commit messages and other metadata?
