[01:11] <akgraner> woot - rolled back to 3.5.0-18 and it seems to work - I'll try and publish this again now - no more updates til I get this done
[01:11] <JoseeAntonioR> akgraner: sorry, can I help? (my ZNC died earlier)
[01:11] <akgraner> sure the wiki is ready to go  - I've removed the "work in progress" can you run the scripts and send me a link to the output
[01:11] <akgraner> JoseeAntonioR, ^^^
[01:11] <JoseeAntonioR> yes, for sure, just give me one second
[01:11] <akgraner> thank you
[01:14] <JoseeAntonioR> akgraner: joseeantonior.com/299 should have everything, I'm still working on ubuntu-news.email as the script is broken
[01:15] <JoseeAntonioR> I'll be back in a bit, znc is taking too much memory
[01:15] <akgraner> k
[01:19] <akgraner> JoseeAntonioR, thank you!
[01:19] <JoseeAntonioR> btw, forums and ubuntu-news.email have no line breaks :(
[01:20] <akgraner> I've got one of the kernel team guys helping me right this second so...
[01:20] <Unit193> As long as my script is working, only OMGUbuntu is down.
[01:20] <akgraner> ok if you them to me  - I can fix them
[01:20] <JoseeAntonioR> it's up
[01:20] <JoseeAntonioR> the outputs are in joseeantonior.com/299 (with no line breaks)
[01:21] <akgraner> Thank you  - I'm there
[01:21] <JoseeAntonioR> :)
[01:21] <akgraner> :-)
[01:23] <akgraner> I <3 this team.  You all are awesome!
[01:23] <Unit193> Except me. ;)
[01:24] <JoseeAntonioR> akgraner: thanks to you for re-building it
[01:25]  * akgraner blushes that honor needs to go to pleia2 
[01:27] <akgraner> JoseeAntonioR, there is a sprint this week so I am trying to get some of the folks there to record some stuff for us
[01:27] <akgraner> will know more tomorrow or wednesday
[01:27] <JoseeAntonioR> ohhh, right, the recordings!
[01:28] <JoseeAntonioR> ok, it's fine, just let me know
[01:30] <akgraner> will do
[01:32] <akgraner> ok new kernel installed - back to publishing :-)
[01:35] <Unit193> According to my script, all links are good except for the OMGUbuntu one.  (Not sure if it was clear my last statement)
[01:35] <akgraner> yep :-)  I knew what you meant
[01:36] <akgraner> thank you
[01:36] <Unit193> Alright, great.  I've been known to be unclear. :P
[01:39] <akgraner> you're fine and Thank you for your help
[01:53] <akgraner> JoseeAntonioR, just so you know - when that happens and there line breaks get messed up - you can use the raw text from the wiki and just clean it up a little - quicker than trying to insert the breaks
[01:53] <JoseeAntonioR> oh, great then
[01:54] <JoseeAntonioR> so I'd just need to change the links part, basically
[01:57] <akgraner> no the links stay the same
[01:57] <akgraner> you pull out any ##
[01:57] <akgraner> change the last line
[01:57] <akgraner> and pull out everything above the welcome
[01:57] <akgraner> :-)
