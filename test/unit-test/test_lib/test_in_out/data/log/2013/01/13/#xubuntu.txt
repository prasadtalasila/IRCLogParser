[00:51] <ubu> sorry my internet connection cuts in and out: did my question go through
[01:18] <meh_> Does anyone have any suggestions for improving boot times? Mine is between 1 and 2 minutes. I tried downloading bootchart, I tried the grub and concurrency shell alterations...

[05:45] <cje_> Hi, I would like to install Xubuntu to a CD, but my CDs are only 700 MB, and Xubuntu is 715 MB of ISO.  What should I do?
[05:54] <holstein> cje_: USB stick, or dvd
[05:56] <cje_> holstein, thx, no DVD on the machine, and I tried USB, but my Dell Dimension 4400 wouldn't boot from USB
[05:57] <holstein> cje_: i use plop to boot USB sticks on legacy gear
[05:57] <holstein> http://www.plop.at/en/bootmanager/index.html
[05:59] <cje_> holstein, I set up the BIOS to boot from 5 different sources, with the hard drive being the last, and the "removable dev" being the first
[05:59] <holstein> cje_: you can make a bootable cd with plop that boots and allows you to boot the USB stick.. or you can use the minimal iso's to install minimal ubuntu and add what you like
[05:59] <holstein> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[06:00] <cje_> holstein, Wow, thanks.
[06:02] <holstein> cje_: you have to create the plop iso.. here is mine https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1172535/temp/plopboot.iso ,not that i would trust every iso that is linked on the IRC
[06:03] <cje_> holstein, thx for that ISO.
[06:04] <cje_> holstein, how does the ISO work?   Does it bring up a GUI, or is it all terminal stuff?
[06:04] <holstein> cje_: a text screen *is* a GUI
[06:04] <holstein> cje_: its has some animations though.. its slick, and does what you want
[06:04] <holstein> cje_: it looks like this... it'll fit on a CD and boot a USB stick on your hardware
[06:05] <holstein> cje_: try it, and if you dont like it, i'll give you a refund
[06:05] <cje_> lol !
[06:06] <cje_> holstein, I am going to bring up xchat on my notebook now so I can chat with you while I do it.
[06:31] <cje_> holstein, I ran out of CDs.  Is it possible to put that plop iso on a 3.5 floppy disk?
[06:41] <hmsck> hello,  how can i change my wireless from *G mode to *B mode please?
[06:57] <cje__> holstein, I tried rebooting with that plop iso CD in my CD ROM, didn't boot

[08:16] <ubottu> Guest3960: Please don't ask the same question in multiple Ubuntu channels at the same time. Many helpers are in more than one channel and it's not fair to them or the other people seeking support.
[09:47] <S0210> Hi! I've just started the system upgrade to 12.04. After the first reboot I get the following message keys: keep on waitng S = skip M = manually fix. What do I need to do to go ?!? (Skip simply switches off my monitor and nothing happens.)
[10:23] <S0210> Any idea? Any suggestion?
[11:05] <alegen> hello. is there a way to limit the number of displayed tray icons in xfce?

[13:12] <SapphireDensetsu> I'm going to be meeting with my school 2 days from now.  In addition to the IEP I'm having, they wanted a private demonstration of Linux, and it's advantages over Windows, and rationale to migrate their 5,000+ computers to the system.  What should I show them, and what should I pitch as my argument.

[17:05] <nantou> is there any command for that?
