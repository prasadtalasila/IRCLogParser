[00:57] <ScottK> Riddell: Yes.
[02:06] <doctorpepper> hi guys !
[02:25] <Darkwing> Riddell: +1 on stickers... I'll be getting a swag request for the Indiana Linux Fest in the next couple months. 
[03:51] <wgrant> yofel, shadeslayer: Hi. Your private PPA (ppa:kubuntu-ninjas/ppa) is currently exempt from normal PPA expiry rules, so its entire 500GB history is preserved and using up quite a bit of space in LP. Would you mind terribly if we switched expiry on for it? Source and binary packages would be permanently removed around a week after they were superseded/deleted from the PPA.
[03:51] <wgrant> yofel, shadeslayer: (we've historically automatically excluded all private PPAs from expiry because they tended to have more useful stuff, but some of them are getting... big)
[04:54] <ScottK> wgrant: I think that's fine.
[06:59] <soee> good morning
[08:33] <Riddell> wgrant: crivvens, yes I think expiry is no problem on kubuntu-ninjas
[08:52] <wgrant> Riddell, ScottK: Thanks
[08:52] <yofel_> wgrant: yeah, go ahead. (I didn't even know that it doesn't expire things...)
[08:52] <wgrant> I assumed you didn't, but I thought it best to check :)

[09:26] <shadeslayer> wgrant: heh, I don't think anyone knew that stuff in ninjas never expired ^_^
[09:37] <sbivol> the KCM for managing users is started as „/usr/bin/kcmshell4 userconfig”. I cannot figure out which package provides this userconfig and how is the PO file named. Please help
[09:46] <shadeslayer> !info userconfig 
[09:46] <ubottu> userconfig (source: userconfig): user and group setup tool for KDE. In component universe, is extra. Version 0.9.0-0ubuntu10 (quantal), package size 30 kB, installed size 237 kB
[09:46] <shadeslayer> sbivol: ^
[09:47] <sbivol> shadeslayer: thank you :-)

[09:57] <shadeslayer> sbivol: https://code.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-packagers/guidance/userconfig-kde4
[09:57] <sbivol> shadeslayer: is it a Kubuntu-only application?
[09:57] <shadeslayer> I think so
[09:57] <shadeslayer> sbivol: note that userconfig is broken in Raring
[09:58] <shadeslayer> and we're discussing whether we should switch to the app that afiestas is writing
[09:58] <sbivol> shadeslayer: which app?
[09:58] <shadeslayer> it hasn't been released yet :)

[12:36] <shadeslayer> hm
[12:36] <shadeslayer> what's this new appmenu thing I hear about
[12:36] <shadeslayer> in 4.10
[12:37] <Riddell> hi doctorpepper 
[12:37] <Riddell> shadeslayer: I've not heard of that
[12:37] <shadeslayer> from Plasma Devel
[12:37] <shadeslayer> > what do you personally like about the results of 4.10?
[12:37] <shadeslayer> I *love* the new appmenu! Once enabled, all apps suddenly do look a lot more
[12:37] <shadeslayer> simplistic!
[12:38] <Riddell> no idea, let me know if you find out :)
[12:39] <shadeslayer> agateau: apachelogger ^ any ideas?
[12:40] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: it's an appmenu :P
[12:40] <agateau> shadeslayer: I think it is the appmenu work I started at Canonical, which have been taken over by a new maintainer and is being integrated in KDE
[12:40] <shadeslayer> I see
[12:40] <shadeslayer> any ideas how I can enable it?
[12:41] <shadeslayer> TBH I really liked the AppMenu
[12:42] <shadeslayer> but could never get it to work properly

[12:43] <shadeslayer> neato
[12:43] <apachelogger> you can make it window decoration based, or menubar plasmoid based or simply exported without visual representation
[12:43] <apachelogger> (e.g. what you would probably do on ubuntu)
[12:44] <Riddell> oy: kolor-manager also lacks a global COPYING file so some files have no licence
[12:44] <apachelogger> do you people actually review the code you upload to the archive? :P

[12:58] <doctorpepper> Riddell: any idea
[12:59] <Riddell> mm, not sure

[13:07]  * Riddell out to shop
[13:10] <shadeslayer> doctorpepper: what does sudo apt-get -f dist-upgrade do ?
[13:13] <doctorpepper> shadeslayer: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519842/
[13:14]  * shadeslayer scratches head
[13:15] <shadeslayer> lemme check something
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio__
[13:17] <doctorpepper> shadeslayer: as for sudo apt-get install kde-window-manager-common that Riddell asked for  i get the same result unable to install it 
[13:17] <shadeslayer> okay
[13:17] <shadeslayer> I'm just checking the packaging
[13:20] <shadeslayer> doctorpepper: can you try this : sudo apt-get install -o debug::pkgproblemresolver=true kde-window-manager-common
[13:27] <doctorpepper_> shadeslayer:did you find something ? 
[13:27] <shadeslayer> nope, the packaging seems fine
[13:27] <doctorpepper_> what should i do ? 
[13:28] <shadeslayer> <shadeslayer> doctorpepper: can you try this : sudo apt-get install -o debug::pkgproblemresolver=true kde-window-manager-common
[13:29] <yofel> as dpkg seems to not really install them, would force-removing just the 2 help maybe?
[13:29] <yofel> no idea if that would matter to apt
[13:29] <yofel> try what shadeslayer said first though
[13:30] <shadeslayer> yofel: I don't want to do that because then someone might hit this later on ... better to know what the issue is so we can fix it
[13:30] <doctorpepper_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519907/
[13:31] <yofel> yeah, but as ^ shows, the deps are fine, just dpkg does something weird
[13:32] <yofel> doctorpepper_: what does 'dpkg -l kde-window-manager-common' say? (last line of output)
[13:33] <shadeslayer> maybe dpkg put it in some weird half configured state?
[13:33] <shadeslayer> and it's trying to install kde-window-manager-common 4.9.5
[13:33] <yofel> seems so - but that should only happen if it's still at 4.9.5
[13:33] <yofel> otherwise you would see the unpack step in the output
[13:33] <shadeslayer> right
[13:34] <yofel> this makes no sense...
[13:34] <shadeslayer> heh
[13:35] <shadeslayer> gee ... when did firefox become so big
[13:35]  * yofel looks at dpkg -Dh
[13:35] <shadeslayer> 108 MB's
[13:35] <shadeslayer> yofel: can you reproduce it?
[13:36] <yofel> well, I couldn't before, so if I try I would first need the source setup and installed package list from doctorpepper_ 
[13:36] <yofel> dpkg has funny options
[13:36] <yofel>    1000  veryverbose      Lots of drivel about eg the dpkg/info directory
[13:36] <yofel>    2000  stupidlyverbose  Insane amounts of drivel
[13:39] <yofel> doctorpepper_: can you try 'sudo dpkg -D63 --configure -a'
[13:42] <doctorpepper_> dpkg -l kde-window-manager-common says  : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519936/    'sudo dpkg -D63 --configure -a' says   http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519937/
[13:45] <doctorpepper_> what should i do ? 
[13:46]  * yofel takes another look at apts debug options
[13:48] <yofel> doctorpepper_: please try 'sudo apt-get -o debug::pkgdpkgpm=true -f install'
[13:50] <shadeslayer> lolwot

[13:51] <yofel> what the hell is apt doing...
[13:51] <shadeslayer> yofel: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519936/ is surprising
[13:51] <yofel> well, that too
[13:51] <shadeslayer> yofel: can it happen that apt didn't download the new package and is trying to install an old copy of 4.9.5
[13:52] <shadeslayer> and thus causing all of these errors
[13:52] <yofel> it's not *installing* anything
[13:52] <shadeslayer> hm?
[13:52] <yofel> it tries to configure something that dpkg says isn't there
[13:52] <shadeslayer> oh
[13:52] <shadeslayer> right
[13:52] <yofel> well, dpkg is also inconsistent
[13:52] <shadeslayer> just saw the last paste
[13:52] <yofel> first it says it's not there, but then says 4.9.5 is there
[13:53] <shadeslayer> ...
[13:55] <yofel> doctorpepper: can you please open /var/lib/dpkg/status, search for 'Package: kde-window-manager-common' and pastebin the textblock until the next Package:?
[13:57] <yofel> after that check if you have a .deb for kde-window-manager-common 4.9.97 in /var/cache/apt/archives so we can force install that.
[13:59] <doctorpepper> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1519984/
[14:01] <yofel> shadeslayer: I would tend to blame apt, but do you have any more ideas for debugging?
[14:01] <shadeslayer> not really
[14:01] <shadeslayer> yofel: maybe ask for the apt history?
[14:02] <shadeslayer> but does that contain info about unpacking and configuring?
[14:02] <yofel> the dpkg log does
[14:02] <shadeslayer> ok it does
[14:02] <shadeslayer> /var/log/apt/term.log
[14:02] <yofel> ah, yeah, that too
[14:03] <shadeslayer> so maybe ask for those and we can figure it out at our convinience?
[14:03] <yofel> yep

[14:04] <yofel> after that try apt-get install -f again
[14:12] <doctorpepper> didnt work .http://paste.ubuntu.com/1520015/
[14:13] <yofel> install the kde-workspace-bin .deb by hand too
[14:14] <doctorpepper> ok  its what i am doing right now
[14:15] <doctorpepper> thanks for your help guys !! 
[14:15] <doctorpepper> is there any plan to backport 4.10 when it out to 12.04
[14:16] <yofel> yes, the first time is the hardest part ;)

[14:26] <Riddell> Quintasan_: for these business cards do we have any editable version of http://mooltilab.nazwa.pl/kubuntu/kubuntu_bc.png ?
[14:27]  * shadeslayer will still push for his cards
[14:27] <shadeslayer> http://people.ubuntu.com/~rohangarg/cards/
[14:27] <shadeslayer> they're more awesome and simpler ^ :P
[14:27] <shadeslayer> I'm actually thinking of switching out the icons in there
[14:28] <shadeslayer> and use the symbols from here : http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/
[14:29] <Riddell> your might win by default if there's no svg of the other one
[14:29] <shadeslayer> hehe

[15:00] <shadeslayer> spacetime: pingly
[15:00]  * yofel wonders if running 2to3 on userconfig would yield something usable
[15:01] <Riddell> yofel: are python kcms now in python 3?
[15:01] <yofel> Riddell: raring's kpythonpluginfactory is linked against libpython3, so it kinda forces py3
[15:02] <yofel> ScottK probably knows more about how that works... (I hope)
[15:03] <shadeslayer> yofel: while you're at it, maybe also run 2to3 on synaptiks?
[15:03] <Riddell> porting to python 3 shouldn't be /too/ hard I'd have thought?
[15:03] <yofel> shadeslayer: that also needs packaging adjusted to actually create a py3 module
[15:03] <yofel> not really, 2to3 does a lot it seems so I guess there's not that much to do by hand
[15:04] <shadeslayer> hmm
[15:20] <yofel> great, PyKDE4.kdecore.ki18n() is causing UnicodeEncodeErrors

[16:28] <apachelogger> basically whenver you pykcm something it goes kaboom
[16:29] <yofel> wasn't that just a python version mismatch?
[16:34] <yofel> well, just converting userconfig to py3 syntax doesn't really work: http://people.ubuntu.com/~yofel/pics/ucp3.png (and don't ask me why ksnapshot is rendered half over it)
