[01:39] <ElectricPrism> Q: anyone here running 13.04 daily? If I run it for say 6months will It automatically become 13.10 daily with updates?
[01:41] <IdleOne> not automatically,you would need to change the repositories to reflect the correct version.
[01:42] <ElectricPrism> IdleOne: Excellent, that's no problem at all, where do I get Ubuntu+1 - I might as well just move from Arch and Sabayon to something with easy software
[01:43] <IdleOne> I believe it is daily.releases.ubuntu.com
[01:44] <IdleOne> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/
[01:45] <ElectricPrism> IdleOne: excellent, appreciate it thanks
[01:46] <IdleOne> sure thing, that comes with all the required warnings about alpha/beta software and such
[01:46] <IdleOne> Don't blame me when you blow up your computer :)
[01:46] <DaemonicApathy> Don't worry, we'll blame PreciseOne.
[01:47] <IdleOne> Sounds good
[01:47] <ElectricPrism> I don't think it could be worse than Sabayon dropping me to TTY1 every time it updates the kernel, and I don't suppose I'll have some funky new EXT4 driver that destroys my files so this should be fun :)
[02:04] <avis> ext4 is always best for hard drives that are standard and can be prone to outages ?
[02:05] <avis> is good enough for that task ?

[11:08] <warren-hill> Are there any plans for 13.04 to have improved support for hybrid graphics?
[11:09] <bazhang> warren-hill, the optimus, you mean?
[11:09] <warren-hill> yes
[11:15] <warren-hill> bazhang,or for a notebook with two ATI graphics cards. Its a question on Launchpad Answers and I'm wondering whether to just reply that for now at least hybrid graphics is best avoided.
[11:17] <bazhang> warren-hill, I'd do that, and repeat here every day or so, some of the developers do peek in and answer sometimes
[11:17] <warren-hill> bazhang, thanks for the help.

[19:02] <dkessel> hggdh, has your/our broadcom wireless problem in raring finally been fixed?

[19:05] <hggdh> (But... I am not holding my breath)
[19:06] <dkessel> hggdh, thanks for checking
[20:01] <dkessel> hggdh, any results? i am surprised because now my wireless seems to work without the bcmwl-source-dksm (or so). but i have a different chipset than you.
[21:09] <FernandoMiguel> boas
