[10:30] <jussi> bah
[11:08] <jacklk> Can someone unban me from #ubuntu?
=== k1l_ is now known as k1l
[11:16] <ikonia> hi jacklk
[11:16] <ikonia> sorr for the slow response
[11:21] <jacklk> hi
[11:25] <IdleOne> jacklk: I was looking at the logs, your comments the last time you were in #ubuntu were very inappropriate and I don't feel comfortable removing the ban at this time.
[11:27] <IdleOne> I think the best thing would be to wait another week and you can come back then. In the mean time I am going to have our bot send you a couple of links you can read over. They should help explain what is acceptable and not acceptable in Ubuntu IRC channels.
[11:27] <IdleOne> !codeofconduct > jacklk
[11:27] <ubottu> jacklk, please see my private message
[11:27] <IdleOne> !guidelines > jacklk
[11:28] <IdleOne> Read those and see you in a week
[11:28] <jacklk> IdleOne: Innapropiate? I only used a command to warm someone of the language but it wasn't how I expected
[11:29] <IdleOne> jacklk: you asked some sexually explicit related question which has absolutely nothing to do with Ubuntu, after I removed you and had the bot send you the link to the guidelines you came back to the channel and pasted some random sentence with more inappropriate language.
[11:30] <jacklk> ..What? That can't be correct.
[11:30] <IdleOne> So, read the links ubottu sent you, come back in a week and we can see then about removing the ban.
[11:30] <jacklk> I never done that. 0.o
[11:30] <IdleOne> if not you then who?
[11:30] <jacklk> I don't know, but I never done that
[11:31] <IdleOne> well, someone with your exact nickname and ip address did.
[11:31] <jacklk> All I remember doing and saying was incorrectly notifiying someone of a foreign language
[11:31] <IdleOne> yes, you did that after an another operator told you to stop fooling around
[11:32] <jacklk> omg
[11:32] <IdleOne> actually you did !fi after the op told you to stop fooling around and THEN you pasted more inappropriate language
[11:33] <jacklk> nope incorrect
[11:33] <jacklk> I said something, done !fi then got kicked
[11:33] <jacklk> I never came back and started using innapropiate language...
[11:34] <IdleOne> ok, you can continue to deny what you said but it does not change the fact that it is logged
[11:34] <IdleOne> !logs
[11:34] <ubottu> Official channel logs can be found at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/ . LoCo channels are now logged there too; for older LoCo channel logs, see http://logs.ubuntu-eu.org/freenode/
[11:34] <IdleOne> 2013-01-19 T 12:17:44
[11:34] <IdleOne> is what you will want to look for date and time wise. As far as the ban being removed, it won't. See you in 7 days.
[11:36] <ikonia> jacklk: how old are you ?
[11:36] <jacklk> ikonia: 14
[11:37] <ikonia> jacklk: ok can you explain this line then
[11:37] <ikonia> 2013-01-19T12:17:44 <jacklk> hi i'm 11 what age will i grow a condom i heard to need to have one to be able to have safe sex
[11:37] <ikonia> 1.) why are you telling lies about information 2.) why are you talking about sex in an ubuntu technical support channel
[11:37] <ikonia> 2013-01-19T12:17:47 <jacklk> will i grow one any time soon?
[11:38] <ikonia> that doesn't seem like "just telling someone about the wrong language" that seems like you messing around and acting like a fool trying to be a problem
[11:38] <IdleOne> You also were removed/banned from other *buntu related channels for similar behaviour back in September.
[11:39] <jacklk> I found that funny
[11:39] <ikonia> then after you where kicked for the above you came back with this nice comment
[11:39] <ikonia> 2013-01-19T12:21:16 <jacklk> 12:10 < plusEV> origin can suck my ass
[11:39] <IdleOne> I would really like to end this now because the ban will not be removed. if you come back in 7 days we can discuss this further and maybe the ban will be removed then.
[11:39] <jacklk> ikonia: Wtf
[11:39] <jacklk> *wth
[11:40] <jacklk> I don't understand that comment, I don't remember posting it
[11:40] <jacklk> WHo the heck is plusEV?
[11:40] <ikonia> jacklk: ok - so we've just proved you can't behave, so basically I'm going to extend on IdleOne's comment and say "you will not be unbanned in the near future - so please find other channels to play your silly games in"
[11:40] <ikonia> jacklk: that is a person you where talking to
[11:40] <ikonia> jacklk: so I think we are don here - find other channels to play games in,
[11:40] <ikonia> bye
[11:40] <jacklk> No
[11:40] <IdleOne> No what?
[11:40] <jacklk> I never came back with innapropiate language
[11:41] <jacklk> And I never posted that crap to whoever "plusEV" is
[11:41] <IdleOne> the logs are public and they don't lie
[11:41] <ikonia> jacklk: it's in the log, I've just pasted it to you
[11:41] <ikonia> so lets not play any more silly games
[11:41] <ikonia> go away - find another channel to play games in, this is done
[11:41] <jacklk> What is origin?
[21:56] <k1l_> whats about the fedora user asking for shortcut settings in gnome 3.6 again and again?
