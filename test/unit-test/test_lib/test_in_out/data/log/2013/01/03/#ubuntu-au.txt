[00:16] <mesquka> Hi
[00:16] <mesquka> I'm back
[00:20] <jea> morning
[00:35] <mesquka> Sooo, whats the anouncement at 4:30
[00:36] <mesquka> Hello?
[00:37] <mesquka> Jea: hello
[01:01] <mesquka> Joel?
[01:04] <mesquka> *sigh*
[01:22] <jea> sorry
[01:22] <jea> came back again now
[01:22] <jea> The announcement was about Ubuntu on Phones
[01:22] <jea> looks a very interesting concept, and if it takes off, i would definitely consider buying one
[01:43] <sagaci> good time, as my nexus s is failing
[01:44] <jea> time to buy a galaxy nexus?
[01:44] <Noskcaj> jea, why would you do that? just get a nexus 4
[01:45] <jea> well, the nexus 4 is very hard to find
[01:46] <jea> moreso the ubuntu announcement this morning was about Ubuntu on phone, and the phone they are targeting at the moment is the galaxy nexus
[01:51] <Noskcaj> there are heaps of australian nexus 4's you can buy
[01:54] <sagaci> with a healthy premium added
[01:54] <Noskcaj> $450
[01:54] <jea> the premium is the issue
[02:04] <mesquka> I dock my phone with my PC most of the time, make texts and calls from my pc instead of actually using my phone
[02:04] <mesquka> Ubuntu-Andriod
[02:04] <jea> you are running ubuntu-android? i didn't realise it was around
[02:04] <mesquka> Google it
[02:05] <jea> i know about it, just hadn't seen images for it
[02:05] <jea> what model phone?
[02:05] <mesquka> Galaxy S 2
[02:05] <mesquka> http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone
[02:06] <mesquka> i find the UI easier to use than the andriod one.
[02:06] <jea> that was the announcement this morning
[02:06] <jea> or have you had it earlier due to doing KDE stuff?
[02:07] <mesquka> http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/android
[02:07] <mesquka> thats been around for quite awhile
[02:08] <jea> yes, the android one was announced a while ago. but i have not seen roms for it at all
[02:08] <mesquka> you dont load a rom onto your phone, it runs out of the box with standard andriod i believe
[02:10] <mesquka> I may be wrong
[02:10] <mesquka> google will know, :)
[02:14] <jea> i think it is a customised version of android, which sounded really good when it was announced
[02:14] <jea> but no phones have come out with it from what i have seen
[02:15] <mesquka> I might look into ubuntu for phones, looks pretty interesting
[02:15] <mesquka> watching the video now, be back when it finishes
[02:34] <mesquka> Very well presented i must say
[03:09] <mesquka> sagaci uses ChatZilla
[03:09] <mesquka> I use Earlybird (thunderbird pre-alpha) :D
[03:38] <mesquka> Hi
[03:41] <mesquka> Hey Jea, what do you think of chatterbox?
[03:48] <jea> mesquka: I haven't started using it yet
[03:48] <mesquka> ok
[03:48] <jea> only had a brief look last night (was half asleep)
[03:48] <mesquka> but what do you think of the interface?
[03:48] <jea> it looks alright i think
[03:49] <mesquka> cool
[03:49] <jea> is the people tab a list of all members?
[03:54] <mesquka> yes
[03:55] <jea> so at this stage everything done is public?
[03:55] <mesquka> yeah
[03:55] <mesquka> there is a pm feature which is private
[03:56] <jea> ok
[03:57] <jea> i would probably change the 'Learn More' link on the front banner to a page about Chatterbox, instead of the Ubuntu CoC
[03:57] <mesquka> ok
[03:58] <mesquka> you can probably tell that i created it to promote open discussions, thats why I don't have much non public things on
[03:58] <jea> that is alright
[04:00] <jea> what uses java on the main openswurl page?
[04:01] <jea> actually, probably should move this converstation to -chat
[04:05] <mesquka> yeah
[23:56] <mesquka> Hi
