[11:11] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[11:54] <Theodore> hello
[11:54] <Theodore> what is the best method to network remote desktop 2 ubuntu os desktops together?
[11:54] <Theodore> using ubuntu 13.04 as the local computer
[11:54] <Theodore> and a ubuntu install of 12.04 on a G5Server
[12:22] <rye> Theodore: this is not 13.04 specific but you may have luck using XDMCP but not with Unity and GNOME Shell (KDE/XFCE will work though).
[12:25] <rye> Theodore: that assumes you are on the same network, if you are accessing the server over the network, VNC may be a better alternative (but still not with GNOME Shell or Unity due to llvmpipe rendering full screen updates)
[13:06] <Theodore> wow thanks rye
[13:06] <Theodore> i will install XDMCP then

[13:22] <rye> Theodore: uhm, you don't really need to install it, just configure in lightdm config file
[13:25] <Theodore> how
[13:25] <Theodore> rye
[13:25] <Theodore> what do i do in ubuntu 12.04
[13:26] <Theodore> to make it run a remote desktop server?
[13:26] <rye> Theodore: fixing the page @ https://wiki.ubuntu.com/xdmcp because surprisingly it does not have the info
[13:26] <rye> Theodore: will ping you back when I finish
[13:26] <Theodore> cool
[13:26] <Theodore> thanks
[13:48] <rye> Theodore: ok, updated wiki page - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/xdmcp

[14:17] <Theodore> lightdm.conf
[14:17] <Theodore> through word
[14:17] <Theodore> or text

[17:26] <Theodore> hello
[17:26] <Theodore> what is the best bluray ripper for ubuntu 13.04?
[17:28] <Theodore> i have lxbdplayer and vlc
[17:28] <Theodore> vlc is giving me aacs error
[17:28] <Myrtti> bekks: Fuchs had a Discussion with him.
[17:28] <Theodore> and lxbdplayer wont load cause aacs isnt loaded properly
[17:28] <bekks> Myrtti: Ah ok then :)
[17:28] <Theodore> what are my options?
[19:23] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here able to confirm what "sudo service networking restart" is supposed to do?  Because I though it would ifdown/ifup all interfaces ... but instead it rendered my desktop useles.

[20:34] <natoka> hi
[20:36] <natoka> I'm trying to get dspam, dovecot and dovecot-antispam working with pipe backend (using sendmail and spam@/ham@example.org)
[20:37] <natoka> my problem is that the antispam plugin seems to ignore any mail movements from and to spam folders (retraining should kick in for that case)
