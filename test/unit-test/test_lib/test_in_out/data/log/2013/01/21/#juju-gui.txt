[13:18] <bac> jujugui: i see a test failure in trunk.  if no one is working on it i'll fix it as it affects an area of the code i'm working on.
[13:42] <frankban> bac: should disable the "Destroy" menu for the Juju GUI service? I see that failing too. thanks for taking care of it.
[13:42] <bac> frankban: yes.  just a problem with the test set up.  fix coming.  a review would be nice.
[13:43] <frankban> bac: sure
[13:46] <bac> frankban: https://codereview.appspot.com/7174043
[13:46] <bac> bcsaller1: you around?
[13:47] <bcsaller1> bac: yeah, whats up?
[13:47] <bac> bcsaller1: can you review https://codereview.appspot.com/7174043 -- our test suite currently has a failure.  easy peasy.
[13:48] <bcsaller1> bac: I think I have that fix in my branch as well, hit the same thing, +1 though
[13:48] <bac> bcsaller1: oh, ok.  i like to do testfix branches in isolation for faster turn-around.
[13:49] <bcsaller1> I'd call that a trivial even :)
[13:50] <bac> yep
[13:52] <frankban> bac: done, thank you.
[13:53] <bac> thanks
[15:30] <bac> alejandraobregon, bcsaller1, frankban:  meeting today?  last one to join has to lead.
[15:30]  * bac votes to cancel
[16:30] <gary_poster> frankban, bac, bcsaller1 especially today, thank you for work.  Please make sure that bcsaller1's branch is reviewed so it can be landed asap
[16:31] <gary_poster> also then please make the email I sent about getting the charm ready to go
[16:31] <bcsaller1> gary_poster: I am cleaning up a lint issue I didn't catch but will submit it in a minute
[16:31] <gary_poster> awesome thanks bcsaller1 
[16:31] <gary_poster> GUI is getting a lot of good press here
[16:32] <bcsaller1> gary_poster: I'm going to attempt one last fix for the drag/delta interaction issue again after that
[16:37] <gary_poster> cool thanks bcsaller1 
[16:38] <gary_poster> bac frankban are you all making progress on the charm stuff?  thank you for your review frankban 
[16:41] <frankban> gary_poster: welcome. When are we supposed to make a release? I'd like to make it after the annotations branch is landed. 
[16:44] <gary_poster> frankban, bac, makes sense.  If everything is done by frankban's lunch tomorrow that will be ok.  If everything is done by bac's EOD that would be even better.  presentation is tomorrow roughly 1800 UTC.  our presentation preparation will be tonight roughly 2230 UTC
[16:45] <bac> gary_poster: ok, will try to get it done today
[16:46] <gary_poster> ty
[16:46] <frankban> bac: ping me if you need help. gary_poster: do you want us to land your charm-proof branch?
[16:47] <gary_poster> yes please frankban.  thank you
[16:47] <bac> gary_poster, frankban: reviewing it now
[16:48] <gary_poster> ty
[16:48] <bac> frankban: reviewed so ready to land
[16:49] <frankban> bac: cool thanks
[17:00] <frankban> gary_poster, bac: charm-proof landed.
[17:00] <bac> good
[17:08] <gary_poster> great, thank you
[17:29] <frankban> bac, gary_poster: I'll make stable and trunk releases before my EOD. bac: he other steps are: 1) request review, 2) communicate the charm can be announced. (a double check that everything works after the release (e.g charm deploy) is strongly appreciated)
[17:29] <bac> frankban: i'm working on the release now
[17:29] <frankban> bac: ah ok
[17:30] <bac> frankban: just updated CHANGES.yaml and proceeding
[17:30] <frankban> bac: great, so ping me if you need help or another eye on qa
[17:31] <bac> frankban: ok
[17:31] <bac> frankban: when do you eod?
[17:32] <frankban> 30min
[17:32] <bac> k
[17:33] <gary_poster> thanks to both of you.
[17:47] <gary_poster> If bcsaller1 gets the fix for bug 1099921 today, it would be great to have that landed asap and I will do as much to help.  even better to have a release with that, but that's icing
[17:47] <_mup_> Bug #1099921: Dragging services fails intermittently <juju-gui:Triaged> < https://launchpad.net/bugs/1099921 >
[17:47] <gary_poster> as much as I can I mean.  maybe some availability this afternoon
[18:12] <bac> frankban: i had a setback (computer crashed) and making the release is taking a little longer than expected.
[18:13] <frankban> bac: uploading it I guess...
[18:13] <bac> yes
[18:29] <bac> gary_poster: does uploading the new release take forever?
[18:30] <gary_poster> bac, pretty sure no.  been awhile since I did one.
[18:37] <bac> gary_poster: it eventually got pushed
[18:53] <gary_poster> cool bac thanks for letting me know
[18:54] <bac> jujugui: release 0.1.5 is on launchpad.  i'm deploying a charm now for testing.
[18:54] <bac> if anyone else wants to QA it, that's be swell before i announce to jorge
[18:55] <hazmat> did the read-only config option make it to the charm
[18:56] <hazmat> cool, it did
[20:00] <therve> hazmat, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1556410/
[20:00] <gary_poster> hey bac.  therve reports some issues with the charm, from an hour or so ago.  (he also says that juju trunk does not work)
[20:01] <bac> gary_poster: i'm still trying to get the charm up on ec2
[20:01] <therve> yeah that's the paste I just put bac
[20:01] <gary_poster> bac, what's the problem you are encountering, do you know?
[20:02] <bac> gary_poster: no, still pending
[20:02] <bac> no indications of error, just taking forever, like it does
[20:02] <therve> bac, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1556414/ is another error I got with the default value for juju-gui-source
[20:02] <gary_poster> bac, it only takes five or ten minutes IME these days.  We eliminated most of the slowdowns
[20:05] <bac> gary_poster: to confirm, i tried deploying with
[20:05] <bac> juju deploy cs:~juju-gui/precise/juju-gui
[20:05] <bac> anything off about that?
[20:05] <gary_poster> bac, did you take a look at log on machine?  I'll see if I can figure out what therve's message means, though there's a meeting I'm in
[20:05] <gary_poster> no, bac (and if the README were broken that would be another issue, of course0
[20:05] <gary_poster> )
[20:06] <bac> bcsaller1: hey can you try to spin up a charm on ec2 in parallel to me trying?
[20:09] <bac> gary_poster: his first paste indicates the charm install hook is attempting to install from a branch not download the release from LP
[20:09] <bac> the release i made (0.1.5) is there
[20:10] <gary_poster> bac, yes, he did his first paste after the second paste didn't work
[20:10] <therve> bac, yeah that's after setting juju-gui-source to lp:juju-gui
[20:10] <bac> therve: ok, i understand
[20:11] <gary_poster> bac, I have a suspicion that therve was trying to use default source (release) while it was being uploaded.  The upload script had created a release on LP before the file upload was complete.  We maybe need to make that code more robust to say "if the file does not exist then we will try the older version"
[20:12] <gary_poster> I'm 80% sure of that diagnosis :-)
[20:12] <therve> :)
[20:12] <gary_poster> After that, we have two more issues:
[20:13] <bac> gary_poster, therve: there was an abnormally long time between the release being created and the upload finishing, so that is a good theory
[20:13] <therve> I'm trying again with a release build
[20:13] <gary_poster> (1) when you (bac) start a juju charm, it never actually completes
[20:14] <gary_poster> (2) The first pastebin shows that the lp:juju-gui thing doesn't work, which should, even though it is supposed to be used rarely.
[20:14] <gary_poster> We have tests for that but they now use a special branch
[20:14] <gary_poster> to test the charm
[20:14] <gary_poster> rather than the integration with the charm and the gui
[20:14] <gary_poster> we should have a separate branch for this
[20:14]  * gary_poster wants some CI
[20:15] <therve> juju-gui-source: 0.1.5 seems to work fine \o/
[20:16] <bac> gary_poster: i destroyed the service and re-deployed it.  the agent state remains in pending
[20:16] <gary_poster> weird
[20:16] <bac> there is nothing i can do as i cannot ssh into it
[20:16] <bac> therve: yay
[20:16] <gary_poster> lemme try to dupe
[20:19] <gary_poster> https://launchpad.net/juju-gui/stable/0.1.5 shows no downloads, which is weird
[20:20] <gary_poster> I don't know if that updates with latency
[20:20] <therve> gary_poster, it does for me
[20:21] <bac> gary_poster: i have created cards for the branch version of juju-gui-source failing for the problem with failure when the tarball is not yet uploaded.
[20:21] <gary_poster> therve, oh, sorry, I wasn't clear.  I meant the download counter
[20:21] <therve> oh
[20:21] <gary_poster> thank you bac
[20:22] <bac> gary_poster: i see a tgz on launchpad at that url
[20:22] <gary_poster> bac, I meant the download counter
[20:22] <bac> oh, the download counter is not real time
[20:22] <gary_poster> cool
[20:22] <bac> it is updated daily
[20:22] <gary_poster> oh ok
[20:22] <gary_poster> that's some latency :-)
[20:23] <hazmat> i've got stats on the charm i can query
[20:25] <bac> gary_poster: it parses apache log files daily to get the download count...
[20:25] <gary_poster> cool bac.  I downloaded it manually
[20:26] <gary_poster> eh, which means nothing new in context.
[20:28] <hazmat> 32 charm downloads from the store
[20:28] <gary_poster> cool hazmat.  I think we have no new bugs, only newly discovered bugs.
[20:29] <gary_poster> but we will verify when one of us gets a charm started from scratch...
[20:30] <gary_poster> bac, fwiw, my machines are taking a long time to start
[20:30] <gary_poster> not the charm but the machines themselves
[20:32] <gary_poster> ok I have a machine...
[20:33] <gary_poster> so far so good.
[20:37] <gary_poster> bac, therve, works for me.  My belief in my previous diagnosis is up to 95%, and high enough for me to leave it alone.
[20:38] <bac> gary_poster: so i'm vexed as to why i can't get a charm deployed on ec2
[20:38] <therve> well you don't seem to be able to get a machine?
[20:38] <gary_poster> bac pastebin the output of your status?
[20:38] <therve> maybe try a different region
[20:38] <bac> since i'm deploying from the charm store, there should be minimal traffic...so my crappy bandwidth isn't an issue
[20:41] <bac> gary_poster: https://pastebin.canonical.com/82615/
[20:42] <gary_poster> bac, what happens when you try `juju ssh 1`
[20:43] <bac> 2013-01-21 16:42:48,630 INFO Waiting for machine to come up.
[20:43] <gary_poster> bac, yeah
[20:43] <gary_poster> that's not our fault
[20:43] <gary_poster> that's EC2 or something
[20:43] <bac> i'm going to destroy the environment and see it anything different happens
[20:43] <gary_poster> I bet the environment will be gone then.  That will be different. :-)
[20:44] <bac> gary_poster: so, how do you want to proceed with the charm announcement?
[20:44] <gary_poster> bac, no go, for a different reason: the environment is pretty broken AFAICT. :-/
[20:45] <bac> gary_poster: how so?
[20:45] <bac> is it broken on uistage?
[20:47] <bac> ugh, pending relation lines are badly broken on safari
[20:48] <gary_poster> bac, I see 2.5 issues.
[20:48] <gary_poster> 1) Click on service.  This shows menu.  Click on "view."  Nothing happens.
[20:50] <bac> 2) When there are ambiguous relations clicking to select one or the other does nothing.
[20:50] <gary_poster> 2) precisely bac
[20:51] <bac> 2.5) profit?
[20:52] <bac> 3) selecting a target service when adding a relation brings up the menu
[20:52] <gary_poster> 2.5) when you try to make a relation from mysql to mediawiki, using the menu, when you click on mediawiki the menu shows up
[20:53] <bac> 4) impossible to dismiss menu by clicking away
[20:53] <gary_poster> yes, bac, that was my 2.5 :-)
[20:53] <gary_poster> oh, good, yes.  I didn't recognize that was a bug, but was annoyed by it
[20:53] <bac> ugh
[20:53] <bac> so i'll go make cards for these
[20:53] <gary_poster> bac, I feel like these need to be fixed before we announce, unfortunately :-(
[20:54] <bac> gary_poster: yes.
[20:54] <bac> but my release making will be faster next time
[20:54] <bac> even if ec2 hates me
[20:55] <gary_poster> bac, please make bugs for them also, and maybe even send an email out to the juju-gui list about the status, mentioning that I emphasize their priority.
[20:56] <gary_poster> We need to make our qa story explicit, while we are improving our test story.
[20:56] <bac> gary_poster: rt
[21:14] <gary_poster> alejandraobregon or jovan2, if you are around, do you know where we can get an svg of the juju logo?
[21:16] <jovan2> gary_poster: greg should have one, I'll ask him
[21:16] <gary_poster> thank you jovan2 
[21:17] <bac> gary_poster: i created the six new bugs and put them in the main story.  the WIP limit of 2 is going to be problematic to moving these cards through.
[21:19] <gary_poster> bac, reversing priority
[21:19] <gary_poster> I mean, WIP limits
[21:19] <alejandraobregon> gary_poster: hi gary, not available in guidelines site, just seeing if can get you one somewhere else
[21:19] <gary_poster> thank you alejandraobregon 
[21:19] <bac> gary_poster: ok
[21:20] <bac> gary_poster: i think you may be the only one with supercow powers to do that
[21:22] <gary_poster> bac, you and I have the same "Manager" role.  I'd expect it is associated with that role, but maybe not
[21:22] <bac> gary_poster: we've seen this before
[21:22] <gary_poster> bac, but I updated it to 4
[21:22] <bac> or perhaps i'm doing it wrong
[21:22] <bac> thanks
[21:32] <alejandraobregon> gary_poster: got it. emailing now
[21:32] <gary_poster> you rock alejandraobregon, thank you!
[21:34] <bcsaller1> bac, gary_poster: has the menu interaction been fixed? I think I see the issue, surprised the tests didn't catch this actually
[21:36] <gary_poster> bcsaller1, no, not fixed unless bac did it (and I don't think he's had time)
[21:36] <bac> bcsaller1: you talking about 'view' not working?
[21:36] <bcsaller1> view and not being able to dismiss I think
[21:37] <bac> bcsaller1: no, they aren't fixed afaik
[21:37] <bcsaller1> bac: ok, on it
[21:37] <bac> gary_poster: my second attempt on ec2 worked fine
[21:38] <gary_poster> bac, more or less good. :-) I don't see how that error could have been our fault
[21:38] <bac> bcsaller1: you can see it broken on uistage
[21:38] <bac> gary_poster: i agree
[21:39] <bac> fwiw, lp2kanban is being relaunched and should update those new cards soon
[21:44] <bac> bcsaller1: i'm going to step away for a bit but will be back shortly
[21:44] <bcsaller1> bac: I'll try to propose before you're back
[22:59] <bac> bcsaller1: are you working on one of the new cards?
[23:00] <bcsaller1> bac: I am working on the viewClick (which works now) and on the serviceMenu toggle
[23:00] <bac> bcsaller1: would you grab the cards on the board so frankban and teknico don't get confused in the morning?
[23:00] <bcsaller1> bac: will do :)
[23:01] <bac> cool.  see you tomorrow.
