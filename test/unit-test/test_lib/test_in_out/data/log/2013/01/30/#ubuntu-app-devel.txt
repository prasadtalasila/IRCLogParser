[10:03] <jackyalcine> Boy, making and patching packages for Ubuntu is no joke.
[10:03] <jackyalcine> doing that all the time would make you a "rockstar" programmer
[10:03] <jackyalcine> lol

[13:16] <GoodHand_> hi
=== dpm is now known as dpm-laptop
[17:37] <aminb> hi everyone. can anybody help me with a question about pygtk and "quickly"?
[17:38] <dz0ny> aminb: maybe
[17:38] <dz0ny> ask
[17:45] <aminb> sure
[17:45] <aminb> thank you guys
[17:45] <aminb> here's my question
[17:46] <aminb> I'm using quickly for development. I have to create a few checkboxes during the runtime.
[17:47] <aminb> my program has to interact with a webserver and receive data and based on those data it should create some checkboxes on the window
[17:47] <aminb> I don't know what I should do exactly. After a I create an instance, do I have to add it to a hbox or vbox or directly to the window?
[17:47] <aminb> I'm a newbie in python and I'm a little bit confused :)
[17:47] <aminb> can you help me with that?
=== dpm-laptop is now known as dpm
[17:49] <dz0ny> hm, checkboxes vary in number?
[17:49] <dz0ny> you should add them to vbox
[17:50] <aminb> yeah. I'll probably loop through the data that I receive from the server and add checkbox for each item
[17:50] <dz0ny> if you have finite number of checkboxes, then maybe better to just change labels?
[17:50] <aminb> basically, I'm trying to write a todo list program with the ability to sync the tasks with a webserver
[17:50] <aminb> is there a better way than using checkboxes then?
[17:50] <dz0ny> html :)
[17:51] <aminb> you mean using html inside my local python app?
[17:51] <dz0ny> you render ui in webkit, communication is done in python
[17:52] <dz0ny> maybe you should first try native python way
[17:52] <dz0ny> once you learn all quirks go the hybrid way
[17:52] <aminb> damn I'm really a newbie and don't know how to do all that stuff..
[17:52] <dz0ny> just suggestion
[17:52] <aminb> yeah that's a good idea
[17:52] <dz0ny> html is easier to design
[17:53] <dz0ny> gtk is pain
[17:53] <aminb> agree
[17:53] <aminb> so, can you write me little snippet to add 3 checkboxes for example to a hbox?
[17:53] <dz0ny> have you seen http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
[17:54] <aminb> I've seen it but I haven't read it thoroughly
[17:55] <dz0ny> chehck http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/button_widgets.html#checkbutton
[17:55] <dz0ny> check*
[17:56] <dz0ny> i'am mobile right now, if you still can't figure it out. ping me in about one hour
[17:56] <aminb> but you know, code generated by quickly is a little bit different than this, and most of these stuff are included by default in libs folder so I don't know how I can create objects after initialization
[17:56] <aminb> of course
[17:56] <aminb> for example, i saw this: http://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.org/en/latest/layout.html#boxes
[17:57] <aminb> but I'm not quite sure how to use it. since quickly generated code is doing the initialization by itself. Do i have to edit those auto generated files then?
[17:57] <dz0ny> yea all windows stuff is already done, other code goes to YourAppNameWindow.py
[17:59] <dz0ny> check this http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~janez-troha/rtvslo-predvajalnik/quickly_trunk/view/head:/rtvslo/RtvsloWindow.py
[18:00] <aminb> so then, how can I add objects to the window after initialization, during the execution of the program?
[18:00] <aminb> I will check that code out, while you're reading my question right now :)
[18:01] <dz0ny> self.my_vbox= self.builder.get_object("vbox_created_in_glade")
[18:03] <dz0ny> then you create checkbox
[18:03] <dz0ny> and add to vbox
[18:03] <dz0ny> eg self.my_vbox.add(chx_box)
[18:04] <dz0ny> thats it
[18:04] <dz0ny> you maybe want to add events, connect method
[18:04] <dz0ny> but thats it
[18:07] <aminb> and then how can add thanks man. I'm currently trying it. but I don't think there is a add method for the box
[18:07] <aminb> i guess i gotta use pack_start but i have to see the doc
[18:19] <aminb> dz0ny: i'm trying to use this
[18:19] <aminb> vp1 = self.builder.get_object("viewport1"); amin = Gtk.Label(); amin.set_text("Hi there! :}"); vp1.add(amin);
[18:19] <aminb> and i get no errors but nothing happens on the window :(
[18:20] <dz0ny> vp1.show_all(); or vp1.showall();
[18:20] <dz0ny> damm those inconsistencies
[18:22] <aminb> it was vp1.show_all()
[18:22] <aminb> thank you so much
[18:22] <aminb> is there a way of doing it using vbox though?
[18:22] <aminb> or i have to deal with viewports?
[18:23] <dz0ny> ithe the same just just pack_start instead add
[18:24] <aminb> i'm gonna give that a try
[18:25] <aminb> damn it. this pack_start is getting on my nerves :D
[18:25] <aminb> i should pass 4 params
[18:25] <aminb> let's see the docs..
[18:29] <aminb> dz0ny: I got it man :) thanks so much for all your help and patience ^_^
[18:29] <aminb> i'll ask my questions here or maybe from you using /msg
[18:29] <aminb> if that's fine :/
[20:27] <jvrbanac> mhall119, I made the changes you mentioned yesterday. The updated diagram is in your email.
[20:29] <mhall119> thanks jvrbanac
[20:30] <mhall119> jvrbanac: release and distro need to be linked
[20:31] <mhall119> at which point, we probably don't need distro linked to platform_items
[20:32] <mhall119> otherwise this looks good
[20:32] <jvrbanac> mhall119, Ahh! I miss understood. Ok, distro -> release -> platform
[20:32] <jvrbanac> right?
[20:32] <mhall119> right
[20:45] <jvrbanac> mhall119, done! I attached them to the wiki page as well. We'll still need to update the page to reflect the changes, but at least we have something to work with.
[20:48] <mhall119> thanks jvrbanac!
[20:49] <mhall119> jvrbanac: we should be able to keep the same UI mockups, they would just be pre-generated when we import APIs, not dynamically generated on page request, right?
[21:03] <jvrbanac> mhall119, I would think so.
