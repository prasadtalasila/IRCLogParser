[04:18] <evilthought> what am I doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/p7KnXzwJ
[04:18] <evilthought> "tune2fs: Not a directory while trying to open /dev/sdb1//media/owner/WD_Drive"
[04:24] <tsimpson> evilthought: why do you think /dev/sdb1//media/owner/WD_Drive is valid?
[04:26] <tsimpson> tune2fs is run on a "device" and those live in /dev, /media/owner/WD_Drive is just a mountpoint, it happens to be where the filesystem on the device /dev/sdb1 is mounted
[04:26] <holstein> is it /dev/sdb1//media? or /dev/sdb1/media?
[04:26] <tsimpson> neither
[04:26] <holstein> true
[04:31] <tsimpson> btw, there's nothing wrong with sequential slashes appearing, //////////////////home/////user is a perfectly valid path ;)
[04:32] <Unit193> No such file or directory. :-----D
[04:32] <holstein> tsimpson: insteresting.. i cant believe i havent found that out by accident ;)
[04:35] <tsimpson> autorepeat is to thank for me finding that out
[04:35] <tsimpson> before I look away from the keyboard while typing anyway
[04:36] <tsimpson> *before I could...
[06:40] <r4y> I want to know your thoughts about http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/
[06:47] <r4y> I want help, but I have to back up then re-install Ubuntu 12 before I can use any help you give me
[06:47] <r4y> I am a big fan of Ubuntu gnome the way it was in Ubuntu 10.04
[06:49] <r4y> What was I supposed to install?, and I am not just saying the interface, for appearances, I know there is more to it then appearances though. Like I had talked about and asked about on this channel making launchers in Unity is not like before.
[06:50] <r4y> I don't know if I tried making launchers in Ubuntu 12's gnome version
[06:50] <r4y> I found this link sometime ago, http://askubuntu.com/questions/61567/how-do-i-change-to-a-theme-not-listed-in-the-appearance-screen
[06:54] <r4y> I've thought about Linux Mint, Debian, Ubuntu 12.04 and Mandrivia. Mandrivia was something my uncle suggested for me to try years ago.
[06:54] <r4y> I am not sure that I am ready for debian though

[07:02] <r4y> Ubuntu 12.04 + Cinnamon ?
[07:04] <r4y> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1970049
[07:06] <r4y> Well at least I have some choices, perhaps I should try these in a virtual box like I have talked about many times. Take care and sorry for any trouble
