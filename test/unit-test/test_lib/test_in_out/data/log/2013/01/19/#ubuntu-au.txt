[02:53] <head_victim> If you're not looking to put internal drives into a microserver I found http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/motherboards/desktop-motherboards/next-unit-computing-introduction.html that appear to be a little interesting.
[04:14] <blahdeblah> head_victim: These are available locally as well http://www.computeralliance.com.au/intel-boxdc3217iye-nuc-core-i3-with-gigabit-network
[04:15] <blahdeblah> Nice looking little boxes for what they are
[04:15] <head_victim> blahdeblah: that's where I found out about them ;) They're my "local" and actually have enough customer service for me to send my parents there alone without assistance.
[04:15] <blahdeblah> That's pretty impressive
[04:15] <head_victim> Basically to me it looks like Intel's take on a Pi with a lot more grunt.
[04:15] <blahdeblah> My main client uses them for all their desktops & laptops
[04:15] <blahdeblah> Yeah - they seem like a nice little box
[04:16] <head_victim> The only downside to CA is that they only carry latest stock. If you want parts for an older machine they probably won't have it.
[04:16] <blahdeblah> Not suitable as a server unless you've got a NAS already, but probably pretty decent as a PC
[04:16] <blahdeblah> head_victim: Off topic: are you on Skype?
[04:17] <head_victim> The intel nucs would probably do for most people who like using external drives to make their files portable and use that to dock them into a nas.
[04:17] <head_victim> Yeah I'm on Skype, never used it for basically anything until I started group assignments for uni.
[04:18] <blahdeblah> Got a sec to do a test with me?
[04:18] <head_victim> Yep, just lokoing up what my user is
[04:19] <blahdeblah> What's your id?
[04:19] <blahdeblah> heh
[04:19] <blahdeblah> I'm paulgear
