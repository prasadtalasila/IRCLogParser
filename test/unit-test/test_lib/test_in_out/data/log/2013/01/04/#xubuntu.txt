[05:53] <Adam___> Hello, I am having a problem with the action buttons applet for xfce4 panel
[05:55] <Adam___> the actions "shutdown" and "restart" are greyed out. I have tried modifying the /.xinitrc to no avail
[06:04] <holstein> Adam___: i would try restart from the terminal and make sure it works.. i would try as a different user to see if my config is breaking something
[06:09] <Adam___> I have restarted several times from terminal.. thanks for the reply and sorry for my delay
[06:10] <Adam___> Forgot to mention this occurred after 40 updates for xfce 4.10
[06:10] <holstein> Adam___: how is it as a new user?
[06:11] <Adam___> I haven't tried yet but I did make sure my user/group had full admin privelages
[06:12] <Adam___> should I log/out in ass guest user?
[06:12] <Adam___> as*
[06:13] <holstein> Adam___: i just suggest taking your current user config out of the equation.. for troubleshooting... however you want to do that
[06:14] <Adam___> ok I will try that now and be back in 5 minutes. Thank-you
[06:15] <Adam___> Oh yeah.. I forgot also when I log out from the menu I get: Method "Logout" with signature "bb" on interface "org.xfce.Session.Manager" doesn't exist
[06:15] <Adam___> I will logout from terminal
[06:20] <Adam___> same thing happened with guest account with/without admin privs
[06:20] <holstein> Adam___: its not the privs im checking for
[06:20] <holstein> Adam___: its the config
[06:20] <holstein> Adam___: assuming all users have greyed out options, then its safe to say its system wide
[06:20] <Adam___> ok
[06:20] <holstein> not a user config issue
[06:21] <Adam___> true
[06:21] <Adam___> I wish I knew what update caused this
[06:21] <holstein> Adam___: i would check for broken packages
[06:22] <Adam___> Immediately after the update is when thins went wonky, I saw this problem on other forums but it was in arch linux
[06:23] <Adam___> They also weren't using a login manager I believe and changing their /.xinitrc fixed the problem for them, but didn't wok for me
[06:24] <Adam___> I will check for broken packages
[06:27] <Adam___> everything seems to be fine
[06:28] <Adam___> besides the problem at hand

[06:36] <holstein> Adam___: i have no shutdown button... or restart..
[06:38] <Adam___> As in you don't have the action-buttons applet in the panel? Or because it isn't checked off in the action-panel properties?
[06:39] <Adam___> action-button properties*
[06:40] <holstein> Adam___: as in, i dont want them, so i dont have them
[06:40] <Adam___> So you just use terminal instead of the GUI is what you are saying..
[06:41] <holstein> i dont use them.. i built what i use daily on my netbook from openbox and tint2 etc... and i dont use shutdown or restart buttons.. since i dont need to shutdown or restart but every kernel upgrade
[06:41] <Adam___> I see
[06:43] <Adam___> I frequently shutdown and restart on my notebook, so it's an ease of access thing for me. Instead of having to open terminal, sudo shutdown -P now, password, etcetera
[06:45] <Adam___> Do you know of any alternative action buttons?
[06:46] <holstein> Adam___: you can create what you like... im not sure whats broken for you though.. i would try reinstalling the 40 packages
[06:46] <holstein> Adam___: at least you kept track of that.. thats helpful id say
[06:48] <Adam___> I'll try that. Thanks for your help holstein
[06:48] <Adam___> appreciate it
[06:49] <holstein> Adam___: anytime.. hope you get it sorted without too much hassle... try the mailing list if you dont get a good answer here..

=== crondd is now known as crond
[15:35] <cousteau> I just installed electricsheep but it doesn't appear on Screensaver settings.  Do I need any extra step?
[15:35] <cousteau> probably rebooting fixes it, but I'd rather not reboot now
[15:36] <cousteau> ...also it shows a generic list of screensavers, some of which aren't installed.  Do I need to add the screensaver to that list somehow?
[15:37] <cousteau> maybe delete ~/.xscreensaver ?
[16:17] <holstein> cousteau: i dont use screensavers, but from what i remember, the list is available/suggested ones
[16:18] <holstein> cousteau: where did you get the electric sheep screensaver?
[16:26] <cousteau> holstein, repositories
[16:27] <cousteau> and it's already on /usr/lib/xscreensaver/electricsheep -> ../../bin/electricsheep
[16:27] <holstein> cousteau: the default ubuntu repos then? you just searched in a package manager? and didnt add any ppa's?
[16:27] <cousteau> correct
[16:27] <cousteau> I didn't reboot the computer either
[16:28] <cousteau> (on the time I've spent afk I could have rebooted it, now that I think of it)
[16:29] <GrapeApe> cousteau: http://www.webupd8.org/2011/11/how-to-get-electric-sheep-to-work-with.html
[16:30] <holstein> yeah, i was thinking that might be an ok place to start, but it references ubuntu tweak which i think is uncessarry for a screensaver config
[16:30] <GrapeApe> eh? how so
[16:30] <cousteau> GrapeApe, ok...  but shouldn't it get added automatically?
[16:30] <cousteau> I even deleted ~/.xscreensaver and it got regenerated
[16:30] <GrapeApe> cousteau: i have no clue why it isn't added automatically. i don't use it.
[16:31] <GrapeApe> cousteau: apparently you need to add it manually
[16:31] <GrapeApe> cousteau: should take about 5 seconds to determine if it works or not
[16:31] <holstein> GrapeApe: oh, thats a different one than what i seached.. yeah.. http://www.webupd8.org/2011/11/how-to-get-electric-sheep-to-work-with.html looks ideal cousteau
[16:31] <GrapeApe> cousteau: if it doesn't; no harm, no foul. remove the line from the file
[16:31] <cousteau> ok, ok, doing it
[16:35] <cousteau> <troll> it says gedit not installed! </troll>
[16:35] <cousteau> ok, there it is!  thanks

[16:54] <xubuntu368> question: how can i return my mouse back to normal sensitivity? it randomly started to highlight and click while i'm just using the track pad to move the pointer
[16:55] <xubuntu368> correction... it's not a mouse, it's a track pad on my laptop
[16:57] <xubuntu368> i'm running xubuntu 12.04
[17:07] <GrapeApe> xubuntu368: is this truly random, or after resuming the laptop ( or any other commonality you can think of )
[17:09] <GrapeApe> xubuntu368: also, does your trackpad have physicla mouse buttons underneath it, or does it 'click' using finger taps

[22:37] <holstein> xubuntu286: remember how long you spent with whatever operating system you used before... how long you used it "as-is".. without networking.. or knowing anything about the file system.. try and give linux/xubuntu the same patience and time
