[04:20] <average_guy> how about a "screen" multiplexer?  I have been reading about them.  Does anyone use one?
[04:20] <Unit193> YOu mean, screen or tmux?  I like screen better.
[04:20] <Unit193> Used both.
[04:21] <average_guy> I use screen for everything
[04:22] <average_guy> I want to look at 4 at a time instead of flipping
[04:23] <average_guy> ever use i3 desktop Unit193?
[04:24] <Unit193> No.
[04:24] <Unit193> AwesomeWM, for testing.
[04:25] <average_guy> I have no windowing currently

[06:51] <cyberanger> average_guy: screen session "Ctrl + a, S" and "Ctrl + a, |"
[06:59] <average_guy> yeah thx cyberanger, just copying stuff from one to another, and pasted on the wrong one :(
[07:00] <average_guy> publicly logged channel wrong... :(
[12:20] <jfenn2199> tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
[12:34] <wrst> hello jfenn2199
[14:12] <wrst> xTEMPLARx:
[14:24] <xTEMPLARx> they who what what
[14:25] <xTEMPLARx> ain't nothin' wrst than a feller who'll call yer name and then not talk at ye
[14:25] <wrst> ha ha xTEMPLARx
[14:25] <wrst> just being aggervatin' today
[14:25] <xTEMPLARx> ;)
[14:29] <wrst>  how you doign?
[14:29] <xTEMPLARx> coughing and choking from sinus fun, otherwise relatively healthy.  Still bummed out from the FB convo, though.
[15:52] <wrst> xTEMPLARx: one with netritious seemed very good?
[16:05] <xTEMPLARx> yeah not that one
[16:05] <xTEMPLARx> the one I deleted from my timeline that he's referring to
[16:05] <wrst> well i missed all the action!
[16:05] <xTEMPLARx> I have a friend that I've known for years and years who now works for a democratic illinois state senator
[16:06] <xTEMPLARx> so since that sort of thing is his bread and butter, as you can imagine he's very vocal and slanted.
[16:06] <wrst> many times the more vocal and slanted someone is their arguments are equally vocal and slanted but doesn't mean they are good arguments
[16:07] <xTEMPLARx> what WAS a great friendship that could talk about anything without anger or belittling judgements is now a very biased and slanted one
[16:07] <xTEMPLARx> and he's taking the familiar tack of "if you don't see and agree with what I"m saying you're a complete idiot and your opinions are crap"
[16:07] <wrst> yeah that's just not cool
[16:07] <xTEMPLARx> which breaks my heart
[16:07] <xTEMPLARx> for real
[16:11] <wrst> yeah it should never get to that, peopel can be passionate about opposing things and still like each other
[16:29] <xTEMPLARx> and we were pretty m uch at that point but it musta stewed in him because he came back with more fuel for the fire
[16:29] <xTEMPLARx> and then his wife jumped in
[16:30] <xTEMPLARx> so I deleted the thread
[16:30] <xTEMPLARx> it was causing me to dread facebook
[16:31] <wrst> why do people do that?
[16:32] <wrst> i mean really
[16:34] <xTEMPLARx> because they're so focused on being "right" and "winning" the argument, that they're willing to sacrifice a friendship in order to do so
[16:45] <wrst> many times when people are that focused on winning an argument they don't let the facts get in the way either ;)
[21:27]  * xTEMPLARx is ready to go home...
[22:01] <xTEMPLARx> in fact...
[22:01]  * xTEMPLARx is out.
[22:07] <wrst> later xTEMPLARx!
