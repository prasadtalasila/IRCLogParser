[11:16] <mlankhorst> wee and mplayer -vo nouveau vdpau bug found :)
[11:16] <mlankhorst> erm swap nouveau and vdpau there
[15:20] <bjsnider> mlankhorst, that shouldn't work, unless there's a gallium state tracker for vdpau
[15:20] <bjsnider> nouveau users should use gl or gl3
[15:23] <mlankhorst> $ glxinfo | grep -i nouv
[15:23] <mlankhorst> OpenGL vendor string: nouveau
[15:30] <mlankhorst> mesa.git even has hw decoding support on some cards
=== schmidtm_ is now known as schmidtm
[15:57] <bjsnider> so, doing a rotation with xrandr on ivb/sna takes down the xserver
[15:57] <bjsnider> without sna, all is fine
[15:58] <bjsnider> that was the only serious sna problem i encountered
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[17:38] <tjaalton> bjsnider: oh, filed a bug yet? assign it to me
[17:39] <ricotz> tjaalton, hi :)
[17:39] <ricotz> could you take a look at libwacom 0.7 and update?
[17:40] <tjaalton> ricotz: tomorrow, sure
[17:40] <ricotz> should be straight forward -- https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/gnome3-staging/+sourcepub/2851075/+listing-archive-extra
[17:40] <ricotz> tjaalton, thanks!
[17:40] <tjaalton> when was it released?
[17:40] <ricotz> mid december i think

[17:42] <ricotz> ;)
[17:42] <tjaalton> not announced on any of the lists i'm on
[17:43] <ricotz> don't worry, i hope you like to push them
[17:47] <tjaalton> yep, sure
[17:51] <ricotz> thanks you
[18:46] <bdmurray> tjaalton: I've installed the new synaptics and I'm still having issue with my trackpad
[18:46] <bjsnider> tjaalton, i was thinking about it but i thought i might wait until raring to see if it's fixed there. this is in quantal
[19:07] <tjaalton> bdmurray: that's weird, same backtrace on the log?
[19:08] <tjaalton> bjsnider: ah, good plan
[19:08] <bdmurray> tjaalton: not exactly
[19:08] <bdmurray> [    63.776] (--) synaptics: Apple Wireless Trackpad: touchpad found
[19:08] <bdmurray> (EE) Apple Wireless Trackpad: Read error 19
[19:08] <bdmurray> [    93.284] (II) config/udev: removing device Apple Wireless Trackpad
[19:08] <bdmurray> [    93.307] (II) UnloadModule: "synaptics"
[19:13] <tjaalton> bdmurray: that's a kernel bug then
[19:13] <tjaalton> the crasher is fixed
[19:13] <bryce> tjaalton, ah thanks for taking a look at it
[19:14] <tjaalton> before it crashed trying to log the error :)
[19:14] <tjaalton> try the kernel from quantal, should work with it
[19:15] <bryce> did the kernel log anything?  dmesg?
[19:16] <bdmurray> Jan 17 10:41:58 impulse kernel: [   63.698471] power_supply hid-c8:bc:c8:f9:78:3d-battery: driver failed to report `capacity' property: -5
[19:16] <bdmurray> perhaps that?
[19:16] <bryce> hmm, unlikely

[19:17] <bryce> tjaalton, any debugging options for synaptics or kernel input he could flip on?
[19:18] <bryce> tjaalton, what was the fix for the X crash?  a particular patch, or a new version?
[19:26] <tjaalton> bryce: a patch for synaptics to use signal safe logging
[19:26] <tjaalton> not aware  about any debugging options..
[19:27] <tjaalton> whot released a new rc for synaptics, many moons late :)
[19:27] <tjaalton> should've been out with xserver 1.13
[19:30] <mlankhorst> heya
[19:30] <mlankhorst> bryce: I've been fixing some vdpau crash bugs in mesa, I think it should be safe to turn on vdpau now
[19:30] <mlankhorst> at least on master branch
[19:38] <bryce> mlankhorst, ok
[19:43] <mlankhorst> might actually be somewhat useful on fermi/kepler
[19:45] <mlankhorst> surprised internet's finest news source didn't pick up on it yet
[19:47] <tjaalton> so, sna or no sna? I'd say yes
[19:47] <tjaalton> could do the switch tomorrow
[19:47] <mlankhorst> didn't look like it broke that much
[19:50] <tjaalton> right
[19:50] <mlankhorst> I think there's no harm in enabling it as a default now, but have to watch out for all the bugs :)
[19:51] <tjaalton> ickle is monitoring them as well
[19:51] <tjaalton> occasionally anyway :)
[19:59] <mlankhorst> I've pushed my old mesa patches upstream now that mplayer vdpau output no longer crashes
[20:02] <tjaalton> next week might be a good time to push new mesa out for testing, in a ppa first
[20:03] <mlankhorst> sure
[20:03] <mlankhorst> updated http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/NVC0_Firmware
[20:03] <mlankhorst> if you're feeling daring you could try to make it work
[20:06] <tjaalton> ooh
[20:07] <tjaalton> can't remember what my t420s has, but accelration at least is disabled on it by default
[20:07] <mlankhorst> if you're really really lucky, try git master :P
[20:07] <mlankhorst> of git
[20:07] <mlankhorst> erm linux*
[20:07] <tjaalton> enabling it results in a hang pretty quickly
[20:07] <tjaalton> ah
[20:07] <mlankhorst> there has been a hang recently, but nvd9 is still broken for most
[20:07] <mlankhorst> hang fix*
[20:07] <mlankhorst> gah.. tired :(
[20:23] <bryce> tjaalton, yeah the two sna bugs reported were cosmetic.  Make sure upstream knows about those, and go ahead and flip on sna
[20:25] <tjaalton> bryce: righty-o
[21:51] <tjaalton> bryce: seen these before? https://launchpadlibrarian.net/128742080/HookError_source_xorg.txt
[21:52] <bryce> tjaalton, I noticed them the other day.  Guessing the HookError* stuff is new?
[21:52] <tjaalton> yeah
[21:53] <bryce> tjaalton, the flaw in question is bad handling of Xorg.0.log when utf characters are in there.  I've actually got that fixed in my xdiagnose branch.  I've just got a couple more tasks (one of which is thorough testing...) before I can upload it.
[21:53] <bryce> tjaalton, I found that sometimes invalid utf-8 chars can slip in via the parsed edid in the Xorg.0.log, and that breaks python...
[21:54] <tjaalton> ah :)
[21:55] <tjaalton> yeah it's not on every bugreport, but some
[21:55] <bryce> tjaalton, I've set xdiagnose up with test cases and sample Xorg.0.log's.  So if we see HookErrors like this in the future, I can just add the given log to the test suite...
[21:55] <tjaalton> nice
[21:55] <bryce> also added a catch-all that if the parser fails, the bug reports still get filed, just without the details parsed from the log.
[21:56] <bryce> tjaalton, so, maybe you can help with the other task...
[21:56] <bryce> I am adding an xedid script which does stuff with edid's
[21:57] <bryce> e.g. it can parse binary edid files into human readable listings, and convert hex edid from Xorg.0.log to binary ones, and so on and so forth
[21:57] <bryce> when it extracts the edid from an Xorg.0.log, it can save it to a file, and I'm debating what to name that file by default
[21:57] <bryce> 01.edid seems uncreative
[21:58] <bryce> I've seen others use 1024x768.edid and similar, so might try that
[21:58] <bryce> why this is important is because xedid also permits installing edids into the kernel firmware
[21:58] <bryce> so we may start seeing these files floating around.  would be nice to ensure they have decent filenames by default...
[21:58] <tjaalton> what's it for, debugging?
[21:59] <bryce> no, for cases where something has broken the edid, e.g. kvms or adapters or whatnot.  Or replacing the edid if the monitor came with a bad edid
[22:00] <bryce> it will probably also be useful for debugging but that's secondary
[22:05] <bryce> hmm, maybe I'll just go with coded manufacturer-productid-serialno for now
[22:06] <tjaalton> yeah, no strong opinion about those :)
[22:07] <bryce> alright, now to the testing....
