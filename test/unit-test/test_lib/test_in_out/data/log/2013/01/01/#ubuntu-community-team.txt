[00:00] <daker> and we are in 2013 :D
[00:04] <JoseeAntonioR> popey, AlanBell: 2013 now came to you!
[00:05] <JoseeAntonioR> daker: you too?
[00:05] <daker> yep
[00:05] <JoseeAntonioR> still 2012 here
[00:06] <JoseeAntonioR> you guys have any idea on which juju charm should I write? /me wants to write one
[00:23] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: what webservices do you deploy/manage/use?
[00:24] <JoseeAntonioR> erm, can't actually say, I think summit, lighttpd, apache2, mailman, postfix and that's it
[00:25] <mhall119> well, summit is done, apache by itself isn't of much use, I suppose the same for lighttpd
[00:25] <mhall119> so maybe mailman?
[00:26] <JoseeAntonioR> I've already been working in mailman and postfix, but I don't know if they're 'good'
[00:26] <JoseeAntonioR> and of course, mailman is dependent of postfix
[00:26] <JoseeAntonioR> https://code.launchpad.net/~joseeantonior/+junk/mailman-charm and https://code.launchpad.net/~joseeantonior/+junk/postfix-charm are the still-in-devel charms
[00:26] <mhall119> between jcastro and barry warsaw, I'm sure you can get help finishing them
[00:27] <JoseeAntonioR> yeah, I'll check later
[00:27] <JoseeAntonioR> any other ideas on which charms should be written? /me has been trying to find something
[00:50] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: how about a charm for octopress, or whatever it is jcastro is using for his blog
[00:51] <JoseeAntonioR> let's check
[00:51] <JoseeAntonioR> yes, octopress
[00:51] <JoseeAntonioR> I'll see if I can charm that
[00:53] <mhall119> I've been thinking of moving from WP to Octopress, so I'd be happy to test it out for you
[00:54] <JoseeAntonioR> I may have something for later or tomorrow
[00:54] <JoseeAntonioR> once I get to it I'll link you to the branch
[09:26] <jokerdino> bkerensa: thanks for the email. :)
[09:34] <bkerensa> jokerdino: no problem ;)
[09:36] <jokerdino> bkerensa: btw, we are in the middle of renaming our app to something better. i suppose you wouldn't mind amending the article if we responded to the interview before deciding on a final name?
[09:36] <bkerensa> jokerdino: surely :)
[09:36] <jokerdino> thanks again :))
[09:36] <bkerensa> gnight folks!
[09:37] <bkerensa> happy new year
[09:37] <jokerdino> Happy new year and good night to you :)

[14:21] <cjohnston> Merry new year
[17:03] <jcastro> mhall119: JoseeAntonioR: octopress doesn't really "run" anywhere
[17:04] <jcastro> it just generates html that you sync over to your host
[17:04] <mhall119> jcastro: oh
[17:04] <mhall119> jcastro: you just scp it over?
[17:05] <mhall119> jcastro: is there anything special to get it to store stuff in S3?
[17:07] <JoseeAntonioR> jcastro: ping ping ping
[17:07] <JoseeAntonioR> mhall119: ping too
[17:07] <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: patience is not your strong point is it :)
[17:08] <JoseeAntonioR> czajkowski: sometimes, but a 'good' idea just popped into my head while sleeping
[17:08] <JoseeAntonioR> happy new year, btw
[17:08] <czajkowski> JoseeAntonioR: it's new years day dude :)
[17:08] <czajkowski> Happy new year to you :)
[17:10] <jcastro> mhall119: yeah, it comes with a deploy rakefile that just uses s3cmd, which is like rsync
[17:10] <jcastro> or you can do it via rsync, scp, or whatever
[17:10] <jcastro> JoseeAntonioR: pong
[17:10] <JoseeAntonioR> jcastro: mind a PM?
[17:11] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: pong
[17:11] <JoseeAntonioR> mhall119: same, mind a quick PM?
[17:11] <jcastro> I always mind pm's
[17:11] <jcastro> it can't be public?
[17:11] <JoseeAntonioR> sort of, but anyways
[17:11] <mhall119> PM is fine, public is preferred ;)
[17:12] <JoseeAntonioR> what do you guys think about doing on-air to make the announcement of the big ubuntu surprise?
[17:12] <JoseeAntonioR> we can have a hangout around the time when the counter ends, and we can invite all people related to the topic
[17:12] <jcastro> I'm not part of the surprise
[17:12] <jcastro> popey mayhaps?
[17:12] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: I don't know who would be available
[17:13] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: we can arrange an on-air in the days following it though
[17:14] <JoseeAntonioR> as you prefer, also baring in mind the team's availability
[17:14] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: those involved will be working on making everything public
[17:14] <mhall119> I think next week we can try for a Q&A on-air
[17:16] <JoseeAntonioR> sure, we have mondays and fridays free
[17:16] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: I'll ask around after the annoucenment and see who would want to come on
[17:16] <JoseeAntonioR> or you can ask jono to move his Q&A
[17:16] <JoseeAntonioR> sure, just let me know
[18:05] <popey> I agree, a hangout would be fun, but difficult to do at 6pm UK time (when the time runs out I believe)
[18:11] <JoseeAntonioR> popey: you're right
[18:11] <mhall119> popey: I thought it was 4pm UK time.
[18:13] <czajkowski> mhall119: narp
[18:13] <czajkowski> it's currently 18:13 here and 23hrs and 46 mins to go
[18:15] <mhall119> damn timezones, confusing me again
[18:22] <imbrandon> I heard it's another shopping lens. :)
[18:22] <mhall119> imbrandon: why would we need another lens, when we can add new stores to the backend?
[18:23] <imbrandon> mhall119: hehe forgot /sarcasm :P
[18:24] <imbrandon> btw Happy New Year mhall119 and All o/
[18:24] <pleia2> imbrandon: trouble maker :)
[18:24] <imbrandon> Always , heh
[18:24] <mhall119> happy new year to you too imbrandon
[22:56] <AlanBell> imbrandon: did you see my new shopping lens?
