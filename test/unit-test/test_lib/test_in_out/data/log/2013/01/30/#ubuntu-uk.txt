[00:15] <Azelphur> whelp, looks like I'm screwed on the sixaxis controller front
[00:15] <Azelphur> talked to the developer and it seems like I broke it, and it's not likely to get fixed till next month earliest, any other ideas?
[00:16] <daftykins> for a gaming controller?
[00:16] <Azelphur> well, for a way to make the controllers I have already work
[00:16] <daftykins> what set do you have to pick from?
[00:16] <Azelphur> would hate to throw £40 down the toilet :p
[00:16] <Azelphur> daftykins: I have GOIGAME PS3 controllers (bluetooth)
[00:17] <Azelphur> I know they physically work because they talk to sixaxis controller on android.
[00:18] <Azelphur> and I'd hazard a guess that they'd work fine with motioninjoy on windows too
[00:18] <Azelphur> but the Linux side seems to have me stumped :P
[00:19] <daftykins> i like cables
[00:19] <daftykins> :)
[00:20] <Azelphur> hehe, cables are annoying when you got 4 controllers and want to sit a decent distance from a 55" tv
[00:21] <daftykins> what's 4 player for the HTPC?
[00:21] <Azelphur> daftykins: every emulator game ever.
[00:21] <daftykins> ah-har
[00:21] <Azelphur> also hedgewars
[00:21] <daftykins> ah yeah i've only ever used a PS2 controller with a USB converter on the PC
[00:21] <daftykins> i have an xbox360 otherwise
[00:22] <daftykins> i have no time for old games ;x
[00:22] <Azelphur> hehe
[00:22] <Azelphur> I might have to do something silly like run windows in a vm and pass the input back to Linux
[00:28] <daftykins> Azelphur: latency++ ?
[00:28] <Azelphur> indeed :(
[00:31] <daftykins> first world problems O_.
[00:31] <Azelphur> yep
[00:56] <Azelphur> Anyone care to drop in and help me with my PS3 controller woes? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12481756#post12481756 :P
[01:02] <daftykins> was the dev just stumped then?
[01:03] <Azelphur> pretty much, he just said he doesn't really know and is busy working on other projects atm and that I should ping him in a month or so to see if he can fix it then
[01:06] <daftykins> heh, how odd
[01:10] <Azelphur> indeed, you'd think more people would buy these things
[01:11] <Azelphur> $14 kickass bluetooth controller...why are we not buying all the things and making them work
[01:12] <daftykins> heh
[01:13] <daftykins> i try to avoid bluetooth
[01:13] <Azelphur> I wonder what stops them being plug n play like other things are
[01:13] <daftykins> it's one of those techs that doesn't work in a hurry when you really want it to
[01:13] <Azelphur> the wiimote stuff I used before was pretty simple
[01:13] <Azelphur> xD
[01:13] <daftykins> Sony? :)
[01:13]  * Azelphur shrugs
[01:13] <Azelphur> I don't mind too much in a hurry, but I would like to get it going
[01:14] <daftykins> y'know it's that classic 'i wanna transfer files via BT'
[01:14] <daftykins> hellz no says mr. computer
[01:15] <Azelphur> lol
[08:17] <popey> Morning
[08:21] <diplo> Morning
[08:25] <knightwise> hey diplo popey :)
[08:25] <knightwise> how are you gus
[08:25] <knightwise> guys
[08:33] <popey> GREAT!
[08:35] <diplo> I'm ok thanks, yourself knightwise ?
[08:36] <diplo> Brought my Revo to work today, reinstall with 12.04 and XBMC Frodo I'm thinking
[09:24] <mungbean> does anyone have knowledge/experience of java web framework spring or struts?
[09:25] <AlanBell> mungbean: Alfresco uses spring
[09:26] <mungbean> AlanBell: i need to give a talk where i reference those products, and suggest best of breed etc
[09:26] <mungbean> don't know where to start tbh
[09:26] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[09:27] <mungbean> do vmware provide for free? what's their motive?
[09:30] <AlanBell> they want to sell their datacenter products
[09:32] <AlanBell> mungbean: I don't know a great deal about spring, Alfresco is the only thing I know that uses it
[09:34] <brobostigon> any idea, where to look for a radar type sensor, that connects to usb, and will be detected by a nominally standard gnu-linux debian . ?
[09:40] <JamesTait> Good morning all! :-D
=== esther is now known as esmo
[09:41] <brobostigon> morning JamesTait
[09:41] <JamesTait> brobostigon, o/
[09:41] <brobostigon> o/
[09:42] <JamesTait> Don't look now, but, where I am at least, it's very spring-like this morning.
[09:42] <brobostigon> sunny, blue sky.
[09:43] <brobostigon> and looks like it will be all day, according to bbc weather.
[09:43] <JamesTait> Yep. Not blowing a gale. Mild temperature. I didn't even wear a coat for the school run, let alone a hat and gloves.
[09:43] <brobostigon> it is blowing a gale here.
[09:44] <JamesTait> I thought our conservatory was going to take off yesterday.
[09:44] <brobostigon> yes, it was quite breezy.
[10:01] <BigRedS> I'm after an smtp client for use with Mutt that'll queue up mail while offline and go on to send it when it's online again, anyone got any suggestions?
[10:02] <BigRedS> I need to be able to use different servers and auth for different mail, though, so something that can do that (like msmtp can) would be good
[10:18] <popey> anyone got a 12.04 machine with nvidia video card handy/
[10:18] <popey> ?
[10:23] <SuperMatt> nope
[10:23] <SuperMatt> 13.04 all the way baby
[10:23] <popey> nvm, I'll install it here
[10:24] <SuperMatt> all righty
[10:28] <JamesTait> BigRedS, masqmail might do it. I looked at it once, many moons ago, but never tried to install and configure it.
[10:28] <JamesTait> brobostigon, I might have spoken too soon about the gales.
[10:30] <brobostigon> ohwell, :(
[10:47] <ali1234> ubuntu kernel is compiled with amiga partition table support and amiga FFS as a module
[10:47] <ali1234> i didn't expect that
[10:47] <popey> ☺
[10:52] <ali1234> sadly, kpartx doesn't seem to understand anything other than dos partitions
[10:54] <directhex> patches welcome!
[10:55] <directhex> gpt support in kpartx would be smart
[11:01] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:16] <BigRedS> JamesTait: ta!
[11:17] <JamesTait> BigRedS, let me know if it works out, I might finally give it a try on my laptop.
[11:19] <BigRedS> JamesTait: I'll have a poke at it tonight; might need prodding to remind you of my success :)
[11:19] <BigRedS> or failure...
[11:19] <JamesTait> BigRedS, not a problem. :)
[11:40] <ali1234> directhex: kpartx supports GPT already
[11:53] <mungbean> how do i show recently added bookmarks in chrome?
[11:54] <mungbean> meh found it, maybe i added them but they didn't sync :(
[11:54] <popey> are they not in chrome://bookmarks/ ?
[11:54] <popey> oh
[11:54] <popey> heh, I have zero bookmarks in any browser
[11:55] <dwatkins> I tend to write a html file and use that as my homepage
[11:55] <dwatkins> much quicker, doesn't depend on me being online etc.
[11:56] <dwatkins> perhaps I'll include an image to test whether I'm online
[11:57] <davmor2> mungbean: if you are syncing to and from a tablet/phone and desktop you may be surprised where the mobile devices stick them
[12:33] <mungbean> got 2 job offers on the table not sure which to take :S
[12:33] <popey> flip a coin ☺
[12:35] <mungbean> a weighted one?
[12:35] <mungbean> all along i've said i don't want job A (which is what i'm currently doing as a secondment) but rather Job B (some unknown element)
[12:35] <mungbean> but when it comes to it...getting cold feet
[12:36] <popey> they're both within the same org?
[12:39] <Azelphur> flip a coin is actually a good trick, it's a psychology thing, if you're torn between two choices, flip a coin xD
[12:42] <mungbean> yes popey
[12:42] <mungbean> by nature i choose the safe option (i.e. known quantity)
[12:42] <mungbean> but under massive transformation we are losing good people and new tech is being deployed by numpties
[12:43] <mungbean> on the plus side its good tech to work with
[12:44] <mungbean> however the other job B gives me a warm feeling about helping people and maximising use of apps and technology for people
[12:44] <mungbean> quandry :S
[12:48] <BigRedS> Azelphur: the trick isn't to just go on what the result of the coin flip saysm, but to ponder your reaction to it :)
[12:49] <BigRedS> of course, that way you might still never actually decide
[12:49] <Azelphur> BigRedS: indeed
[12:50] <davmor2> mungbean: the question is, is the money the same? if so then the only difference is the way the job makes you feel, I can tell you happier is better than sad but known.
[12:51] <Azelphur> http://pastebin.com/DwWJGcgu why is this patch doing this?
[12:53] <davmor2> Azelphur: knock the -bin off the patch name maybe
[12:54] <BigRedS> There's a guy two desks down reading up on btrfs. I keep hearing "Oh wow, that's awesome" "We really need to be doing this"  etc.
[12:54] <BigRedS> might have to experiment with this...
[12:55] <Azelphur> davmor2: nope still same issue
[12:55] <mungbean> money is the same davmor2
[12:56] <mungbean> my heart says jobB, head says i know how to do jobA. i'm not really a risk taker
[13:01] <bigcalm> Good afternoon peeps :)
[13:01] <bigcalm> davmor2: no, still just 'looking after it' for our neighbour. Neighbour is providing food and vet coverage
[13:02] <davmor2> bigcalm: yeah but they are home now :)
[13:02] <davmor2> bigcalm: hello by the way how is your holiday?
[13:02] <bigcalm> davmor2: hence the ''. It's a bit odd
[13:02] <davmor2> bigcalm: also more importantly how is the new pc
[13:02] <bigcalm> davmor2: hi :) I'm getting used to it
[13:03] <bigcalm> davmor2: hasn't yet been purchased
[13:03] <bigcalm> davmor2: I was able to get a quote from a Dell business sales person. Waiting for my company to place the order
[13:04] <davmor2> bigcalm: man the way you were talking you'd got it
[13:04] <bigcalm> davmor2: for some reason, the quote I was given is less than the website stated
[13:04] <bigcalm> davmor2: ah, no. I just like to be prepared. Will buy a 120ish GB SSD at some point in prep.
[13:06] <Azelphur> Anyone know who I might ask about bluez stuff?
[13:06] <Azelphur> #bluez-users is dead
[13:20] <mungbean> in irrsi, i use alt+num to flick channels. if i have >10 channels, i do alt+0 then alt-arrow to move along - how do i jump to 13 directly?
[13:21] <bigcalm>  /win 13
[13:22] <bigcalm> mungbean: there may be a plug-in to let you map more alt+<key>
[13:23] <mungbean> ok thanks, /win 13 is longer than alt ->
[13:28] <daubers> Afternoon
[13:29] <popey> mungbean: alt+e
[13:29] <popey> the row below 1-0
[13:30] <popey> goes all the way up to alt+o
[13:30] <mungbean> wow great :D
[13:30] <mungbean> thanks
[13:30] <mungbean> irc win today with all my questions
[13:30] <mungbean> (except the job one)
[13:31] <popey> with the job one I'd compile a big spreadsheet with weighted pros and cons
[13:31] <popey> but thats just me
[13:36] <mungbean> thats a methodical approach i tend to agree with. i've been complaining about this job since last year, i think i know what to do
[13:36] <mungbean> i also pray about it, which i know you don't do ;)
[13:42] <popey> hah

[14:18] <diplo> popey: You about ?
[14:22] <Flex> hi guys, im trying to run a script via a cronjob and am setting the env variables within the script itself
[14:22] <Flex> do i need to source the script itself?
[14:22] <Flex> . /path/to/script/script.sh
[14:22] <Flex> ?
[14:23] <popey> diplo: ya
[14:25] <dwatkins> source a script within itself?
[14:25] <dwatkins> how are you setting variables, and what shell does the script use, Flex?
[14:26] <Flex> dwatkins: bash and export
[14:26] <dwatkins> should be fine then, from what I remember
[14:26] <Flex> to do
[14:27] <Flex> . /path/to/script/script.sh
[14:28] <dwatkins> I mean just setting a variable at the beginning of the script then using, printing it, you shouldn't need to include the script itself as that would be recursive.
[14:29] <dwatkins> Flex: for example: http://hastebin.com/nucacoyaxi.bash
[14:29] <diplo> popey: Sorry my session seems to be broken on other machine
[14:29] <diplo> Just wondering if you're still running Revo with XBMC
[14:30] <diplo> if so, any recommendations before I reinstall, mines been on for 3+ yyears now i think
[14:30] <diplo> :)
[14:30] <Flex> am running xbmc on my revo
[14:30] <diplo> What are you running on it Flex ?
[14:30] <Flex> os?
[14:30] <diplo> Mines still running 9.04, want to upgrade to Frodo and update OS as well
[14:30] <diplo> yeah
[14:31] <Flex> win 7 a) because i use silver light b) the missus cant use linux
[14:31] <diplo> ah, no win7 license so stay with ubuntu i think, justnot sure which wm to go with
[14:31] <dwatkins> fluxbox for teh win! ;)
[14:32] <diplo> heh
[14:32] <popey> diplo: yes, my "behind the telly" box is xbmc on a revo
[14:32] <popey> I think it's xbmcbuntu
[14:33] <diplo> ah I was just checking that out now actually
[14:34] <Flex> diplo: who needs a license ;)
[14:36] <diplo> :)
[14:36] <Flex> dwatkins: not sure if that applies when running from cron though....?
[14:37] <dwatkins> Flex: hmm, you might need to account for other environment variables (e.g. PATH) not being set, but I don't know much more than that
[15:06] <popey> Google Nexus 4 is back "in stock" (ships in 1-2 weeks) https://play.google.com/store/devices/details?id=nexus_4_16gb

[15:13] <Azelphur> I already got mine on my desk
[15:13] <Azelphur> :P
[15:13] <popey> ☺
[15:13] <popey> just ordered one ☺
[15:13] <Azelphur> welcome to the club
[15:14] <Azelphur> popey: rofl, and already my friend is like LOAN ME MONEY SO I CAN BUY NEXUS 4
[15:14] <Azelphur> that happened fast
[15:15] <davmor2> Azelphur: 400% interest see if still wants to borrow it then ;)
[15:15] <Azelphur> haha
[15:15] <Azelphur> he's a good mate of mine and his paycheck comes in tomorrow, so loaned him the money xD

[15:20] <Azelphur> woo, my friend managed to get one
[15:23] <KungFuPanda> ?
[15:23] <Azelphur> !
[15:25] <KungFuPanda> :), I using network tool scan my port, only 80, 8088 are open. how could I remote connect it ?
[15:25] <KungFuPanda> ssh, remote desktop ?
[15:26] <DJones> !ssh | KungFuPanda
[15:26] <lubotu3> KungFuPanda: SSH is the Secure SHell protocol, see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH for client usage. PuTTY is an SSH client for Windows; see: http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/ for it's homepage. See also !scp (Secure CoPy) and !sshd (Secure SHell Daemon)
[15:26] <DJones> That should get you started with ssh
[15:26] <KungFuPanda> but my port 22 is closed
[15:27] <KungFuPanda> can I use ssh by port 80 or 8088 ?
[15:27] <dwatkins> I've run ssh on different ports before, so long as server and client agree and the port is open on the firewall etc. yeah
[15:28] <KungFuPanda> if I use port 80, is that will affect my browsing ?
[15:28] <davmor2> KungFuPanda: have you actually install the server for ssh which would open port 22?
[15:28] <KungFuPanda> yes
[15:29] <davmor2> KungFuPanda: are you running a firewall
[15:29] <KungFuPanda> I tried ssh localhost, which success
[15:29] <KungFuPanda> no
[15:29] <KungFuPanda> ufw inactive
[15:29] <KungFuPanda> the port be closed by router, I guess, I got public static ip
[15:29] <DJones> Have you told your router to forward external requests to the machine with ssh running?
[15:30] <KungFuPanda> no
[15:30] <KungFuPanda> I try to avoid doing that, if I can find a solution.
[15:31] <KungFuPanda> can one port 80 provide 2 service ? http and ssh  at the same time ?
[15:31] <DJones> This should help you configure your router to forward whichever port you decide to forward to the machine running ssh http://portforward.com/routers.htm
[15:31] <dwatkins> opening port 80 on your router for something to connect to from an external address is separate from connecting to an external website on port 80
[15:32] <DJones> If you use a non-standard port (ie not port 22) you'll need to configure ssh to listen on that port, the link from lubotu3 should give you details of how to do that
[15:33] <KungFuPanda> thanks all , for you great help, I will try now.

=== Hornet- is now known as Hornet
[17:27] <davmor2> MartijnVdS: UEFI is a pain in the arse fullstop
[17:27] <MartijnVdS> but microsoft!
[17:28] <davmor2> MartijnVdS: Nope even MS from USB isn't entirely foolproof, from cd/dvd is fine but then so is Ubuntu but more and more devices don't have drives now
[17:29] <MartijnVdS> But Microsoft made UEFI required, right?
[17:31] <davmor2> MartijnVdS: They tried to be clever, in order to speed up the boot process they do a search for secure uefi devices but do it occasionally faster than they give power to the usb ports meaning sometimes your device has no power and UEFI is marching on regardless
[17:32] <davmor2> MartijnVdS: and MS made secureboot a requirement which therefore made UEFI a requirement
[17:34] <davmor2> MartijnVdS: it does however mean that I have no license key sticker as the license key is the machine itself which I can see being an issue if you wanted to install windows 9 on that box :D
[17:35] <MartijnVdS> davmor2: well if Win8 can read it, Win9 would be able to as well, right?
[17:35] <AlanBell> czajkowski: \o/ http://blog.ubuntu-women.org/2013/01/ubuntu-women-full-circle-follow-up-with-laura-czajkowski/
[17:35] <MartijnVdS> and the retail/upgrade versions come with keys
[17:37] <davmor2> MartijnVdS: but if it depends on a different secureboot key you might be stuffed unless you upgrade your hardware :)
[17:38] <MartijnVdS> davmor2: Well.. or you can buy a patch from the manufacturer or MS of course!
[17:38] <MartijnVdS> for £a_lot
[17:39] <davmor2> MartijnVdS: effectively turning your machine into a replaceable device whenever MS upgrade which would make the manufacturers happy

[18:22] <brobostigon> it seems some what implausable.
[18:22] <brobostigon> but seems to be the only factor.

[20:39] <AlanBell> http://www.theopensourcerer.com/2013/01/ubuntu-smart-scopes/
[20:44] <popey> tweet/G+ it and I'll retweet etc
[20:52] <MartijnVdS> popey: about that :) Do you have some magic client that puts everything on G+ and twitter at the same time, or do you copy/paste everything you post?
[20:52] <popey> yes
[20:52] <MartijnVdS> ...
[20:52] <popey> \o/ dots
[20:52] <MartijnVdS> Do you copy/paste?
[20:52] <popey> yes
[20:52] <MartijnVdS> So no magic client? :(
[20:53] <popey> I often type stuff in twitter first to fit the 140 chars, then paste elsewhere
[20:53] <popey> and I do the same on PC or phone or tablet
[20:54] <MartijnVdS> popey: I was wondering, because your twitter and G+ feeds are _very_ similar :)
