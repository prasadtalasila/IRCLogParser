[06:54] <antarus> Is it possible to get https://bugs.launchpad.net/debian/+source/bash/+bug/778627 SRU'd to Precise?
[06:54] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 778627 in bash (Ubuntu) "In natty, bash completion now quotes shell variable references rather than expanding them" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[06:58] <antarus> (or do you want a debdiff?)
[08:37] <jibel> antarus, you'd first need a fix in raring
[08:37] <jibel> antarus, then nominate for precise once it's "fix released" in raring
[08:38] <jibel> antarus, https://wiki.ubuntu.com/StableReleaseUpdates for reference
[09:22] <freedomrun> hi, it seems I cannot finish bug-report in launchpad anymore, any cluo what should I check here?

[16:27] <antarus> jibel: ok I have a teammate who has done an SRU successfully before, I will learn from her ;)
[16:28]  * TheLordOfTime randomly appears
[16:28] <TheLordOfTime> hey hggdh or anyone else on bugsquad, are you receiving bugsquad mailing list messages?
[16:28] <TheLordOfTime> i randomly stopped receiving them and am trying to investigate
[16:33] <jibel> TheLordOfTime, last message is https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-bugsquad/2013-January/004015.html which I received
[16:34] <TheLordOfTime> see, i didn't get that via bugsquad's list.
[16:34] <TheLordOfTime> i got that via the bugcontrol list
[16:34] <TheLordOfTime> so...
[16:34] <TheLordOfTime> not sure what's going on there.
[17:09] <TheLordOfTime> om26er, any reason you want to focus specifically on transmission for the bug day?
[17:11] <om26er> TheLordOfTime, transmission is simple, we could have choses totem or rhythmbox but they are relatively complext given the stakeholdres which are involved in those. We chose transmission because of its similicity
[17:11] <TheLordOfTime> s/we/you/?
[17:11] <TheLordOfTime> unless i missed an email chain
[17:11] <TheLordOfTime> which is likely if ubuntu-bugsquad ML is failing to send to me
[17:11] <TheLordOfTime> which seems to be the case
[17:11] <TheLordOfTime> (i only read about the bug day because you CC'd bugcontrol)
[17:12] <om26er> TheLordOfTime, I had a chat with p ersia where I was suggesting to go with Totem or Rhythmbox but those were considered a bit complex, since we were rebooting the HugDay thing he suggested to keep it towards a simple package
[17:12] <TheLordOfTime> right.  was curious, is all.
[17:13] <om26er> and bug days generally work like that, if anyone wants to start a hug day for a certain package they add that to the planning page and when the time arrives just send the email to the lst and do a blogpost
[17:13] <TheLordOfTime> yep.  i was just curious about the choice of "transmission"
[17:13] <om26er> TheLordOfTime, ;)
[17:13] <TheLordOfTime> ... aw damn not again
[17:13]  * TheLordOfTime seriously hates oidentd, because of LP Bug 1094773
[17:13] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1094773 in oidentd (Ubuntu) "oidentd spawns a new process for all new connections unless -l [number] defined" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1094773
[17:15] <om26er> TheLordOfTime, so you will be participating in the hug day, right ? :)
[17:15] <TheLordOfTime> om26er, tomorrow's an... interesting day...
[17:15] <TheLordOfTime> om26er, i've got classes all evening, and two upstream security bugs i'm working on for projects not in ubuntu
[17:15] <TheLordOfTime> so...
[17:16] <TheLordOfTime> i'll let yo uanswer that question yourself (no offence)
[17:17] <om26er> TheLordOfTime, that's fine..
[17:17] <om26er> talking about classes I had an assignment to create for tomorrow which I totally forgot and I was thinking of just going to bed :/
[17:17] <TheLordOfTime> om26er, that, and my specialization is server packages, afaik transmission's one of those desktop programs that falls outside of my specialization.
[17:17] <TheLordOfTime> :P:
[17:18] <TheLordOfTime> ... dear god this coffee is AWESOME
