[00:58] <RagnarokAngel> what happened to lib32ncurses5 and lib32stdc++ ?
[02:56] <linuxman410> anyone here
[14:04] <xTEMPLARx> poor linuxman410 :(
[14:04] <xTEMPLARx> nobody was here
[14:13] <wrst> xTEMPLARx: i was here, but i do go away for a minute or two on occassion
[14:13] <xTEMPLARx> yeah me too!
[14:13] <xTEMPLARx> a minute or two! that's it!  that's the ticket!
[14:13] <wrst> xTEMPLARx: how are you doing?
[14:14] <xTEMPLARx> sleepy
[14:14] <xTEMPLARx> tired
[14:14] <xTEMPLARx> could use some more sleep and a maid
[14:14] <wrst> amen xTEMPLARx
[14:15] <xTEMPLARx> how was your Christmas and New Year, Senor Stout?
[14:16] <wrst> very good just hard to get back in the groove, and yours?
[14:16] <xTEMPLARx> pretty good.  spent half of it sick as a dog, but smiles were still had :D
[14:17] <wrst> ha ha me too, stomach virus? flu? both?
[14:18] <xTEMPLARx> oh, flu
[14:18] <xTEMPLARx> it was funny
[14:19] <xTEMPLARx> I had the week of Christmas off for vacation, as well as the monday after (NYE).  Well, the MONDAY of the week before Christmas vacation, my boy was sick.  I went in tuesday, started feeling worse and worse, then started getting all the signs of a fever.  almost talked myself out of going to the doc on the way home, but I went anyway... they said I set the flu alarm off faster than anybody else they'd tested this season.  no work for a
[14:19] <xTEMPLARx> week for me
[14:20] <xTEMPLARx> so I essentially got two weeks off thanks to that
[14:22] <xTEMPLARx> granted, one of those weeks was no fun
[14:22] <xTEMPLARx> but still
[14:23] <wrst> yes two weeks off is good, i had a week and half and the week of christmas i had a stomach virus
[14:23] <wrst> lasted badly for 3 days but didn't feel too good until last week
[14:23] <xTEMPLARx> no fun at all
[14:23] <wrst> we are like old people talking about our ailments
[14:23] <xTEMPLARx> hey at least I'm not taking 7-9 different pills two times a day yet
[14:23] <xTEMPLARx> YET
[14:24] <wrst> ha ha :)
[14:39] <cyberanger> xTEMPLARx: you should, it can be fun
[14:39] <cyberanger> esp when mixed with a 20-yr old scotch
[14:40] <wrst> cyberanger: you trying to turn xTEMPLARx into an addict? :)
[14:40]  * wrst can't wait for his ubuntu phone, he will use it with his ubuntu tv... oh yeah...
[14:40] <cyberanger> wrst: no, well, yes, a linux addict
[14:40] <wrst> ha
[14:41] <cyberanger> wrst: and then there will be unity in your home
[14:41] <cyberanger> pun intended
[14:42] <wrst> ha well they will have to get a product actually, well, produced! first
[14:43] <xTEMPLARx> I actually think the ubuntu phone looks pretty darned sweet
[14:44] <xTEMPLARx> but, it hinges upon performance
[14:44] <wrst> xTEMPLARx: i do too actually, but some issues, first distribution, probably internationally it has an ok chance
[14:44] <wrst> second its totally gesture based, i fear they made some basic errors in win8 aka the charms menu... well where is something telling me its there
[14:45] <wrst> its almost like a keyboard shortcut method to touch, and how many typical users use keyboard shortcuts
[14:45] <xTEMPLARx> I installed win8 on my windows partition of this machine... not impressed
[14:45] <xTEMPLARx> completely pointless to install it on anything other than a tablet-style system
[14:48] <wrst> yeah i tried the RC and preview stuff I was NOT impressed
[14:49] <cyberanger> 810G downloaded, AWS is gonna love me this month
[14:49] <cyberanger> ...and it's not done
[14:52] <wrst> ouch cyberanger, do they charge based on data use with your plan?
[14:55] <cyberanger> I'd bet when we start talking 3TB, plans go out the window
[14:56] <wrst> ha ha probably so!
[14:56] <wrst> that probably violates some type of use clause  in the EULA
[14:56] <cyberanger> no, it's actually with their blessing
[14:57] <cyberanger> but I think they charge per Xbyte
[14:57] <cyberanger> idk if it's kb, mb, gb or what
[14:58] <cyberanger> but AWS rates aren't too bad (and this project will be funded in a few ways at the end, just gotta suffer the costs upfront)
[14:58] <wrst> they aren't bad I have thought of running one for my server stuff as limited as it is wouldn't cost much at all
[15:00] <cyberanger> I found for that, for me, linode is cheaper
[15:01] <wrst> hmm that would be good also
[15:01] <wrst> i may try to do that this year
[15:01] <cyberanger> but this much data, and the Import/Export service, it's really about the only option
[15:10] <wrst> cyberanger: and they have a connection that rocks so you can make fairly quick work of moving that much data
[15:14] <cyberanger> well, fairly quick is still slower than I'd like
[15:15] <wrst> yes but probably quicker downloading it there than transferring over my home network
[15:43] <cyberanger> had to say, there's a bottleneck between servers
[15:43] <cyberanger> but it beats my own links
[15:45] <wrst> i'm trying to decide on what to do with my home network
[15:52] <cyberanger> simple, asterisk, turn it into a home phone network ;-)
[15:53] <wrst> ha
[16:00] <wrst> cyberanger: i'm still considering just making one also, i have a spare box now that I could make it work
[16:01] <wrst> not for sure if its got enough umph however
[16:37] <wrst> hello average_guy
[17:50] <average_guy> hi wrst, anything happening
[17:51] <wrst> lunch for me average_guy, how about with you?
[17:51] <average_guy> I sittin here tryin to figure out irssi
[17:52] <average_guy> never used it before
