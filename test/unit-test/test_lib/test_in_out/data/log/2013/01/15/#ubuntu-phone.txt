[10:19] <salmaan> Will it be possible to run GTK+ applications on Ubuntu Phone? or, we can to re-create the GUI using QML?

[16:03] <GuidoPallemans> I'm making a Reddit reader app for the phone! Anyone care to join me? (QML) https://github.com/brambram/UbuntuPhoneRedditApp
[16:32] <Bouib> hello
[17:07] <J2t> has anyone tried to install ubuntu os on a htc one s?
[17:08] <J2t> or do i het to be a guinea poig?
[17:08] <J2t> pig*
[17:11] <J2t> dkessel, do you know of anyone that has tried to install ubuntu os on a htc one s yet?
[17:11] <Tak> there's no release for ubuntu phone yet
[17:12] <dkessel> J2t, no, see Tak's response
[17:13] <J2t> will it be compatible with a one s?
[17:13] <J2t> i already know it will work with the towers of the carrier i have...
[17:13] <popey> we've not committed to any models yet
[17:14] <popey> the demos have been given on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus though
[17:15] <J2t> great.... i have already seen it on a nexus...
[17:15] <J2t> yea.
[17:36] <dangersalad> has anyone had trouble getting XmlListModel to pull data? It seems to not do anything when I load the application
[17:54] <jono> GuidoPallemans, hey
[17:54] <jono> thanks for working on the reddit app!
[17:54] <GuidoPallemans> hey no problem
[17:55] <jono> GuidoPallemans, I am going to talk to the design team to see if we can get some support from them for the app
[17:55] <GuidoPallemans> waaw thanks!
[17:55] <jono> also mhall119 is here to provide any help you might need working with Canonical
[17:55] <GuidoPallemans> oh thanks
[17:55] <jono> :-)
[17:56] <jono> just post plenty of screenshots on reddit as it developers :-)
[17:56] <GuidoPallemans> can you ask the design team to get some kind of reddit integration into the phone? like the facebook integration
[17:56] <GuidoPallemans> I wouldn't know what they can do for the app, really
[17:57] <GuidoPallemans> the design is finished, I just need to man up and make the app :D
[17:58] <jono> GuidoPallemans, I will see the team tomorrow, so I can discuss it then and get back to you :-)
[17:58] <GuidoPallemans> thanks!
[17:58] <GuidoPallemans> I'm also in #qt-qml
[17:59] <mhall119> hey GuidoPallemans
[17:59] <GuidoPallemans> hmm?
[18:01] <mhall119> GuidoPallemans: the Facebook integration is done through Webapps scripts, I believe
[18:01] <GuidoPallemans> oh..
[18:01] <mhall119> which we could do for reddit too, but it would use the browser to view the site, not a custom interface
[18:02] <GuidoPallemans> oh ok
[18:03] <GuidoPallemans> I've asked this before, but is there an ubuntu-phone-dev? I feel like this channel is too big to ask questions about it
[18:03] <GuidoPallemans> although there is #qt-qml
[18:04] <mhall119> GuidoPallemans: no, I think this channel is pretty much all about phone app dev though
[18:04] <dangersalad> can anyone help me figure out why an XmlListModel would not be loading anything?
[18:05] <mhall119> dangersalad: unable to load the XML?
[18:05] <dangersalad> yeah
[18:06] <dangersalad> I have it pointing to my servers api, but it looks like the server is never even getting the call
[18:06] <dangersalad> is there a way to see if it is even requesting the data?
[18:07] <mhall119> wireshark will let you watch allnetwork traffic on your machine
[18:08] <mhall119> I'm pleased to announce that we now have Precise and Raring packages of the QML Toolkit: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-sdk-team/+archive/staging
[18:08] <dangersalad> well thats good
[18:08] <dangersalad> I changed the sources.list file to get the quantal packages on precise
[18:08] <dangersalad> should I change them?
[18:09] <mhall119> yes, this is a differnet PPA too, which everybody should switch to using
[18:09] <dangersalad> mhall119: thanks
[18:09] <dangersalad> mhall119: could that be part of my problem with the XmlListModel not making it's call out?
[18:10] <mhall119> dangersalad: probably not, this is likely the same code just re-packaged for the other releasede
[18:11] <dangersalad> mhall119: I do not use nework manager (I use wicd) so wireshark is a no go
[18:12] <daker> dangersalad: try tcpflow or tcpdump
[18:12] <dangersalad> daker: just installed iftop, looking at that
[18:13] <daker> dangersalad: sudo tcpflow -i lo port 80
[18:15] <dangersalad> daker: that is giving me nothing....
[18:16] <dangersalad> can I not use https for this?
[18:16] <mhall119> dangersalad: wireshark shouldn't care what you use for that
[18:17] <mhall119> oh, https, you won't be able to ready the traffic
[18:18] <dangersalad> mhall119: when I tried to set up a new connection, it logged something about loading network manager
[18:18] <dangersalad> mhall119: ok, so is there nothing in place for https?
[18:18] <dangersalad> mhall119: I don't understand what you mean by "ready the traffic"
[18:19] <daker> dangersalad: read* the traffic because it's encrypted
[18:20] <daker> dangersalad: try this sudo tcpflow -p -c -i eth0 port 80
[18:24] <dangersalad> daker: I am getting something there (with wlan0 for me) but nothing is showing up besides the ip checker for conky....
[18:24] <mhall119> dangersalad: wireshark reads raw network traffic, but https packets are encrypted, so while it will see the packets, it won't be able to see what's inside them
[18:25] <mhall119> dangersalad: it's possible that something in your QML isn't invoking the XmlListModel properly
[18:25] <dangersalad> occams razor would suggest so, I have double checked my syntax and all, but I will triple check I guess
[18:25] <mhall119> dangersalad: are you following the currency converter tutorial, or writing something new?
[18:28] <dangersalad> mhall119: I am following the currency converter tut, just tweaking to use my xml api instead of the currency one
[18:43] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: sorry, I had to restart irc, did you have anything to say while I was gone?
[18:44] <mhall119> dangersa1ad: no, sorry
[18:44] <mhall119> dangersa1ad: did the XmlListModel work for you when you did the currency converter?
[18:44] <dangersa1ad> I did not do the currency converter verbatum
[18:45] <dangersa1ad> I suppose I will try that to see if I went wrong somewhere
[18:46] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: yeah, it works fine. I will see if I can find where I messed up
[18:47] <mhall119> dangersa1ad: ok
[18:47] <mhall119> dangersa1ad: feel free to post on askubuntu.com or the app developer forum
[18:47] <mhall119> http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=417
[18:48] <mhall119> http://www.askubuntu.com/questions/ask?tags=application-development
[18:49] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: would it have to do with the url I am using for a source? it does not point to a filename, but has a query string
[18:49] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: everything else is set up like the example
[18:50] <mhall119> dangersa1ad: the query string might be an issue, I'm not sure
[18:51] <mhall119> bobweaver: ^^ do you know if the XmlListModel can take a query string?
[19:35] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: I tried pulling in an xml file from a url with .xml for the extension and it worked fine, so I guess I need to adjust my API
[19:53] <epicfail> How do i get ubuntu phone on my samsung s3
[19:53] <epicfail> Is it released
=== sw_ is now known as sw
[19:53] <netcurli> no, it is'nt released ye
[19:53] <dkessel> epicfail, see channel topic please
[19:53] <netcurli> *yet
[19:53] <sw> epicfail: read the channel topic
[19:53] <epicfail> Damn
[19:54] <epicfail> Someone knows when it does
[19:55] <sw> epicfail: read the channel topic
[19:55] <mhall119> dangersa1ad: is your server setting the correct mimetype?
[19:55] <dangersa1ad> application/xml
[19:55] <epicfail> Bitches
[19:55] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: should it be text/xml?
[19:55] <mhall119> yeah
[19:56] <mhall119> no, I think application/xml is correct
[19:57] <dangersa1ad> thing is, I have a logger running in the server app, spits out lotsa info when I run a call against it. When I start up the app with the query string, it does not log anything.
[19:57] <mhall119> so the server isn't getting the connection...
[19:58] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: right
[19:59] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: but when I have a direct link to an xml file for the source, it pulls it down just fine
[20:25] <dangersa1ad> mhall119: so it does take a query string, but does not get data over httos for some reason
[20:28] <mhall119> dangersalad: ah, does your server accept https connections?
[20:28] <dangersalad> mhall119: yes it does https://evillair.dangersalad.com/project.xml?auth_token=7eca1cd7fa448d92a1b0937c8a0ca16c works fine in a browser or curl
[20:29] <dangersalad> mhall119: though i do have a self signed cert, so maybe I need to disable verification
[20:39] <mhall119> or add it to whatever QML apps use for trusted keys
[20:40] <dangersalad> mhall119: yeah, I just check my apache logs, and the cert is set up for my mail server's subdomain, and the api does not match it
[22:11] <romaxa> which browser is used as default browser on ubuntu phone? som Qt Webkit1/2 based browser, chrome or something different?
[22:18] <GuidoPallemans> I think WebKit
[22:18] <GuidoPallemans> that'll be the easiest to make at least
[22:20] <romaxa> hmm interesting. does it have QML ui? is it available in on some VCS?
[22:20]  * romaxa working currently on Mozilla Embedding API's and ability to make easy Native UI on top of Gecko Engine
[22:22] <popey> romaxa: i dont think that's been finalised.
[22:22] <romaxa> wonder how easy it would be to put That browser UI on top of Mozilla Engine (Which has MultiThread/Process rendering and some other sweet features)
[22:22] <romaxa> popey: is it based on Webkit1/Qt4 or Webkit2/Qt5 ?
[22:23] <popey> it's qt5
[22:23] <popey> see http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/
[22:25] <romaxa> popey: yep I saw that, but not sure what is default browser based on... WebKit2 or 1... is there are repository for devs?
[22:25] <popey> 22:22:11 < popey> romaxa: i dont think that's been finalised.
[22:25] <romaxa> yep, so that is closed source until finilazed?
[22:27] <romaxa> I have made async embedding api which allow to build QML browser as simple as this one https://github.com/romaxa/mozilla-central/blob/embedlite/embedding/embedlite/tests/qt/qml/qml/MainPage.qml
[22:27] <popey> well, we will release an image and the source code soon.
[22:27] <Walther> oh, the all-famous and geek-a-licious "released soon" :3
[22:28] <popey> its still being heavily worked on, when it's ready we'll release the code
[22:28] <Walther> textbook tip one, how to keep a geek/nerd waiting anxiously and excited :P
[22:28] <popey> heh
[22:28] <romaxa> popey: soon it is days, weeks, months, years, decades ? :)
[22:29] <popey> yes
[22:32] <romaxa> yes - is it typo? or you meant years?
[22:33] <popey> no
