[01:45] <len-1304> Eh?
[01:46] <Unit193> No, it's "Who's there?"
[01:51] <cfhowlett> hey guys.  HUGE problem ...
[01:52] <cfhowlett> I cannot seem to download CodeFree magazine here in China.  The files are hosted on a wordpress site which is blocked by the gov't.  Little help?  Can someone email/dropbox/ubuntuone share them with me?
[01:53] <cfhowlett> from thee to me and grateful eternally ... http://codefreemagazine.wordpress.com/
[01:54] <holstein> cfhowlett: i already did that for you man
[01:55] <holstein> cfhowlett: you should ask the creator what you are supposed to do
[01:55] <holstein> cfhowlett: email him and ask for a torrent community
[01:55] <holstein> cfhowlett: offer to host the torrents if he emails them to you
[01:56] <cfhowlett> holstein: file attachments from google docs are also blocked it seems.  I left several messages for Chris but no response.
[01:56] <holstein> cfhowlett: i already gave you dropbox links too
[01:56] <cfhowlett> holstein: but I do know and appreciate that you tried.
[01:56] <holstein> cfhowlett: i dropboxed them and emailed them
[01:56] <holstein> not sure what else you want to try
[01:56] <cfhowlett> holstein: chinese internet is ... different.
[01:57] <holstein> cfhowlett: sure.. im just saying, what else do you want to try?
[01:57] <holstein> cfhowlett: ubuntuone?
[01:57] <cfhowlett> holstein: ubuntone does connect and work.
[01:57] <holstein> cfhowlett: so, what do you want me to do then
[01:57] <holstein> cfhowlett: i have tried dropbox and email.. and ubuntuone doesnt work? so what do you want?
[01:57] <cfhowlett> holstein: ubuntuone if it's not too much trouble.  Please.
[01:57] <holstein> OK
[01:58] <cfhowlett> No ubuntu one DOES work!
