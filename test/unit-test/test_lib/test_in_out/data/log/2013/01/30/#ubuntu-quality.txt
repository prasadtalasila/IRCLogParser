[06:25] <Noskcaj> just found a bug in 12.10, at least xubuntu amd64. when you make a program open in half the screen by dragging it to the top, pressing the maximise button maxes the top part of the window go above the screen
[08:17] <Noskcaj> ping to anyone here
[08:30] <jibel> good morning
[08:31] <Noskcaj> evening jibel
[08:31] <pitti> jibel: bonjour!
[08:31] <jibel> Hey pitti Noskcaj
[08:31] <pitti> jibel: FYI, I fixed the hanging xvfb and lost processes on rabisu this morning, so https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/view/Raring/view/JHBuild%20Gnome/ is getting blue again
[08:32] <Noskcaj> are either of you guys able to run a daily install for me?
[08:32] <dholbach> good morning
[08:33] <pitti> jibel: I just "damaged" all checksums in the data file, that ought to trigger a complete rebuild, right?
[08:33] <jibel> pitti, ah, good. I killed some stalled dbus processes yesterday evening, I'll need to add a proper cleanup after the runs
[08:33] <jibel> pitti, yes, it will
[08:33] <pitti> jibel: they all failed with "Xvfb: failed to start" because of the lingering Xvfb process
[08:34] <Noskcaj> bug 1087409, please confirm outside of Vbox
[08:34] <ubot5> bug 1087409 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "*buntu dailys take 3 minutes to get to the next screen if install mp3 is selected." [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1087409
[08:34] <jibel> pitti, yes, that's pretty common, about once a week
[08:34] <pitti> Noskcaj: there's not much to debug there, it's pretty clear what happens AFAIK
[08:34] <pitti> Noskcaj: same effect when you install it on a laptop with a broadcom wifi
[08:35] <pitti> there's a missing progress report UI from ubiquity
[08:35] <Noskcaj> pitti, my issue is it only appears with the mp3 selected
[08:36] <pitti> Noskcaj: yes, that will trigger the "install additional/non-free drivers" functionality
[08:36] <pitti> the VB driver is not really non-free, but it's an UI design compromise
[08:36] <Noskcaj> ok, just realised my fault, nvm
[08:36] <pitti> Noskcaj: well, not "your fault" really, it really does sit there for a while doing nothing
[08:37] <jibel> Noskcaj, lack of feedback is a UI bug IMO
[08:37] <pitti> Noskcaj: I'm just saying that this is "triaged"
[08:37]  * pitti adjusts
[08:38] <pitti> Noskcaj: bug updated
[08:38] <Noskcaj> ok, ty

[10:31] <pitti> jibel: we don't run libo upstream tests for raring any more, do we?
[10:31] <pitti> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/search/?q=libreoffice
[10:31] <pitti> and all of the four have a last build in November
[10:31] <pitti> jibel: or has that been entirely replaced with the bibisect stuff?
[10:34] <jibel> pitti, bibisect does't replace it and it's lower priority because they are run as part of the build in the PPA.
[10:35] <jibel> pitti, and I didn't have time to activate daily builds for raring yet
[10:35] <pitti> jibel: ah, ok; thanks for the heads-up!

[11:52] <dholbach> pitti, is http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/auto-pkg-test.html#executing-the-test all we need to point a potential test case reviewer at? or do you feel we should add something there? or on a separate page on the wiki maybe?
[12:16] <pitti> hey dholbach
[12:16] <pitti> dholbach: that's the operational bits indeed; if that fails, it's definitively not ready yet, so it's a really good check
[12:17] <pitti> dholbach: it should also be "sensible" in the context of the package, of course (but that's true with anything you sponsor of course)
[12:23] <dholbach> pitti, perfect, thanks
[12:31] <dholbach> pitti, could you imagine doing a quick hangout to talk people through a test or two - we could do it in an "interview" format - we could do it earlier on Friday and then point people to the youtube link later on
[12:38] <pitti> dholbach: sure, let's try that
[12:38] <dholbach> pitti, shall we pick a time already?
[12:38] <pitti> dholbach: I have a dentist appointment at 10:30; so earlier, or after 11:15
[12:39] <dholbach> will you be able to talk after the appointment? :)
[12:39] <pitti> yeah, it's no big deal :)
[12:39] <dholbach> then let's do it afterwards - you might be more relaxed then :-P
[12:40] <pitti> I shall point out that hangouts are still working exceptionally bad, though
[12:40] <dholbach> ok
[12:40] <pitti> so we might need to move to IRC
[12:40] <dholbach> we can try it and if it fails, I can try to do it
[12:40] <dholbach> or that
[12:41] <dholbach> I would  be a very poor substitute for TEH PITTI :)
[12:41] <pitti> well, so are hangouts :)
[12:41] <pitti> there's nothign I can point to :)
[12:41] <dholbach> :-)
[12:41] <pitti> that was much easier IRL at UDS
[12:42] <dholbach> yeah :)
[12:42] <pitti> dholbach: hey, can we try a hangout now? I'll try on my mobile
[12:42] <dholbach> sure
[12:42] <dholbach> let me invite you - just a sec
[12:43] <pitti> dholbach: ah, already invited you
[12:43] <dholbach> ah ok
[12:44] <pitti> dholbach: can't hear you
[13:25] <dholbach> greyback, did I see it correctly - you live in Berlin? :)
[13:45] <greyback> dholbach: correct
[13:45] <greyback> dholbach: I moved there about 3 months ago
[13:45] <dholbach> greyback, very nice - I had no idea :)
[14:11] <cprofitt> morning everyone
[14:12] <roadmr> hello!
[14:12] <cprofitt> how is your day going roadmr ?
[14:12] <roadmr> cprofitt: fine so far :) yours?
[14:14] <cprofitt> It is going well for a first day back to work from being ill
[14:14] <cprofitt> lots of catching up to do
=== smartboyhw_ is now known as smartboyhw
[14:33] <cprofitt> balloons: ping
[14:33] <cprofitt> or anyone else really
[14:33] <cprofitt> any advice on how to best schedule a meeting for a team that appears to be equally split by a 5-6 hour time difference?
[14:34] <cprofitt> I am using a doodle poll right now...
[14:34] <smartboyhw> cprofitt, you mean on Ubuntu Friendly uh?
[14:34] <cprofitt> smartboyhw: yeah
[14:34] <cprofitt> trying to get UF to have some regular meetings
[14:35] <smartboyhw> cprofitt, so if it has a 5-6 hour differece, set the later one at it's local time 16:00, and set the earlier one 10:00
[14:35] <cprofitt> the one I am working on now is really just an initial meeting, but I truly believe some form of regular meeting keeps teams on-track
[14:36] <cprofitt> I was really looking to have one meeting not two different ones, but I guess having two could work
[14:36] <cprofitt> I had not considered that
[14:36] <smartboyhw> cprofitt, how would it work?
[14:36] <cprofitt> on the poll I put two early evening GMT times and two early evening UTC times
[14:36] <cprofitt> I do not know... I thought that was what your suggestion was
[14:38] <cprofitt> smartboyhw: I assume you were not talking about having two different meetings, but how to list the options on Doodle?
[14:39] <smartboyhw> cprofitt, I never used doodle:P
[14:41] <cprofitt> ah.
[14:41] <cprofitt> Doodle is just a poll system for trying to find the optimal meeting time
[14:41] <cprofitt> lets people vote on which time(s) they can meet.
[14:41] <smartboyhw> cprofitt, just ask the guys who are interested in this first...
[14:42] <cprofitt> yep, that is what has been done.
[14:42] <cprofitt> just struggling with the idea of cutting half the team out of a meeting
[14:43] <cprofitt> the first set of responses only resulted in less than half the interested folks being able participate at any one time
[14:43] <cprofitt> perhaps setting up an asychronous system would work better, but I have not used too many of those.
[14:44] <cprofitt> most of those are most 'task' oriented and not discussion
[14:44] <cprofitt> phillw: ping you around?
[14:44] <phillw> cprofitt: indeed i am :)
[14:45] <cprofitt> thanks for voting so quickly in the poll
[14:45] <phillw> saves me forgetting to vote :)
[14:45] <cprofitt> you have any good ideas on how to ensure we get input from everyone despite the 5-6 hour time split in the team?
[14:47] <phillw> as you have the EP set up, it is a case of reminding people to put ideas on to it.
[14:48] <cprofitt> EP?
[14:48] <phillw> ether pad http://pad.ubuntu.com/sClb0uH2g8
[14:48] <cprofitt> ah, yes
[14:48] <smartboyhw> phillw, hmm getting a new life at packaging now:)
[14:49] <phillw> you have a suggestion already from me :)
[14:49] <cprofitt> thanks Phillw
[14:49] <phillw> smartboyhw: great :) Have you decided on a time for your session?
[14:49] <smartboyhw> phillw, as you reminded me now, I will set it at 19th Feb 13:00 UTC
[14:49] <smartboyhw> Final date:)
[14:50] <phillw> can you edit the wiki page and let Lyz know :)
[14:50] <smartboyhw> phillw, ok
[14:51] <phillw> you may want to add to the wiki page that people will need an iso !
[14:52] <cprofitt> phillw: was that directed towards me?
[14:52] <cprofitt> the wiki page and lyz?
[14:52] <cprofitt> UWN?
[14:53] <cprofitt> I do think the wiki page needs editing, but was not sure if it should be tackled before some things had been ironed out
[14:56] <phillw> cprofitt: no, sorry, it was for smartboyhw
[14:57] <phillw> finally nailed down the last -classroom time & date on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Activities/Classroom
[15:03] <cprofitt> phillw: ok
[15:03] <cprofitt> good, glad you got classroom filled
[15:03] <cprofitt> sorry that with everything going on I could not do a session
[15:11] <phillw> cprofitt: a classroom can be done at any time. Just give the classroom people a poke whenever UF wants to hold one. They're a great way to get noticed :)
[15:12] <smartboyhw> phillw, thx
[15:47] <cprofitt> phillw: yep, thanks
[15:51] <cprofitt> wow... I never realized that the UK got so little snow
[17:29] <balloons> thomi, you about yet
[17:29] <balloons> ?
[17:41] <thomi> balloons: I am now
[17:41] <thomi> *yawn*
[17:42] <thomi> balloons: what's up?
[19:05] <balloons> well, shoot.. I didn't say anything in here, but thomi and I just hosted an autopilot session for udw
[19:10] <thomi> haha
[20:09] <TLoT> how thoroughly has the 12.04.1 ISO been tested?
[20:09] <TLoT> for installation?
[20:13] <TLoT> ???
[20:16] <balloons> TLoT, prior to release we did a full workup
[20:17] <TLoT> to what extent?
[20:17] <TLoT> because https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/220961 seems to be occurring on this system
[20:17] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 220961 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "[MASTER] ubiquity crashes instead of notifying the user of not enough disk space" [High,Triaged]

[20:17] <TLoT> (apport triggered that)
[20:18] <TLoT> i'm trying a reinstall to see whether the partition schema i set up is the cause
[20:18] <balloons> hmm
[20:18] <TLoT> (shouldn't be!)
[20:18] <balloons> do you have logs from the install?
[20:18] <TLoT> none that i can share
[20:18] <TLoT> i'm not willing to divulge my information unless bugcontrol decides to wake up and answer my quesiton in -bugs
[20:19] <TLoT> (the logs would contain password data)
[20:19] <balloons> TLoT -- no, it won't have that personal data in it
[20:19] <balloons> you can see what's in the logs anyways
[20:19] <TLoT> balloons: the debug logs that apport were collecting said that it would have it
[20:19] <balloons> and you should/could check
[20:19] <TLoT> so unless apport is LYING
[20:20] <balloons> but you didn't get that far did you? I mean to the user install
[20:20] <balloons> username choice
[20:20] <TLoT> good question
[20:20] <TLoT> it said "installing system"
[20:20] <TLoT> and then went boom
[20:20] <balloons> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingUbiquity
[20:20] <TLoT> no time, i have to head out to a meeting
[20:21] <TLoT> if it errors out again i'll be back
[20:21]  * TLoT will remain connected in lurkmode
[20:21] <balloons> TLoT, ok -- the logs are deifnitely helpful in this case
[20:21] <TLoT> balloons: and you'll know if i get back, there'll be me raging at the computer.
[20:21] <TLoT> whatever log(s) existed are likely being overwritten as we speak
[20:21] <TLoT> it could very well have just been the partition setup i had
[20:21] <balloons> kk
[20:21] <TLoT> but we'll see
[20:22]  * TLoT told it to not update as it goes, so...
[20:22]  * TLoT runs off
[20:24] <TLoT> okay, that's... interesting
[20:24] <TLoT> it seems to have resolved itself?
[20:24] <TLoT> so... creating 3 partitions is too  hard for it?
[20:24] <TLoT> HUH?
[20:24]  * TLoT shrugs
[20:24] <TLoT> back later

[22:24] <epikvision> Hello ubuntu quality! I am installing raring into my desktop and something is wrong.
[22:26] <epikvision> Hopefully, this is the right place to ask. First of all, i just installed raring straight from a daily image amd64. But after reboot, I see a blue screen called Memtest86.
[22:27] <balloons> epikvision, is the disc still in the system?
[22:27] <balloons> memtest86 is an option from the iso
[22:28] <epikvision> No, it rebooted straight to memtest without the disc.
[22:29] <epikvision> Now i see an exploding list of red and errors piling in mounds.
[22:29] <epikvision> balloons It passed up to 46%.
[22:30] <balloons> epikvision, very odd
[22:30] <balloons> did you install to your physical machine?
[22:30] <balloons> you don't even get a boot menu?
[22:33] <epikvision> Yes, although installation was perfect, it passed the intel boot splash screen, but it didnt make it to login screen.
[22:47]  * epikvision waves at balloons.
[23:18] <balloons> so epikvision I hope that takes care of your issues ;-)
[23:18] <balloons> glad you got raring going on your laptop
[23:19] <epikvision> balloons I hope so too. I remember installing a daily build a while back, and i encountered the same error.
[23:21] <epikvision> balloons, its ok! Multitasking can bring up some inevitable bumps.
[23:21] <balloons> :-)
[23:25] <epikvision> Ok i filed it. LP #1110875
[23:25] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1110875 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "After installation, raring build boots to memtest " [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1110875

[23:26] <TheLordOfTime> o.o
[23:27] <TheLordOfTime> balloons, you may want to make a note somewhere that ubiquity may need to be beaten with a hammer - creating more than 2 partitions using the manual partitioner breaks things.
[23:27] <TheLordOfTime> which is what caused the initial implodification
[23:27] <epikvision> I know, it's strange.
[23:31] <epikvision> thanks balloons for the reporting walkthrough!
[23:32] <balloons> TheLordOfTime, heh, back eh?
[23:32] <TheLordOfTime> balloons, with  a working system yes.,
[23:32] <balloons> xnox is here, or hiding.. not sure.. but there is etheir a bug, or an explaination
[23:33] <TheLordOfTime> indeed
[23:33] <balloons> we should settle it
[23:33] <TheLordOfTime> can you wait about 10 minutes?/
[23:33] <TheLordOfTime> i am recovering data to incorporate for a reboot...
[23:33] <TheLordOfTime> so...
[23:33]  * TheLordOfTime is rebooting inot the new working system
[23:33] <TheLordOfTime> s/inot/into/
[23:33] <xnox> i'm looking at the logs from epikvision's bug and I'm not seeing anything strange happening in the syslog yet...
[23:55] <TheLordOfTime> and we're back :P
[23:56] <TheLordOfTime> xnox:  do you know of any bugs in ubiquity or otherwise which would cause the installer to say "insufficient space" during installation?  perhaps if i have "Update software during installation" selected?
[23:56] <TheLordOfTime> balloons:  ^
[23:58] <xnox> for example - if you have more ram than disk-space we incorrectly create massive swap and only 2GB '/' which is not enough to complete the install.
[23:59] <xnox> or otherwise passed the "have sufficient space check" but created '/' of 2GB
