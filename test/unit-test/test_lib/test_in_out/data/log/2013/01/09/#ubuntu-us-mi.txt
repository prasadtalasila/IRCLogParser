[00:59] <snap-l> rick_h_: Hey, slacker... where are you?
[00:59] <rick_h_> home, just got done cleaning the kitchen
[00:59] <snap-l> Bah
[00:59] <rick_h_> :P
[00:59] <snap-l> That's no good
[00:59] <rick_h_> can't make it every month
[01:00] <snap-l> you should have a dirty kitchen and be here.
[01:00] <snap-l> ;)

[04:05] <greg-g> I still hate seeing mac keyboards at ostensibly floss companies: http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/ubuntu-for-android.jpeg
[12:12] <brousch> greg-g: At least it's just a keyboard!
[13:09] <snap-l> greg-g: I used to have an Apple keyboard on my computers
[13:09] <snap-l> I just liked the Apple hardware.
[13:10] <snap-l> http://terribleminds.com/ramble/2013/01/09/search-term-bingo-the-revengification/
[13:27] <snap-l> If anyone wants physical copies of THe Perl Journal (issues 10-20) let me know
[13:27] <snap-l> I'll bring them tonight at CHC
[13:27] <snap-l> Otherwise they're getting recycled.
[13:52] <snap-l> jcastro / smoser: Here's where I got those Antenna for my router: http://ur1.ca/cgqkv
[13:53] <snap-l> Price is $15.
[13:54] <snap-l> I paid $30.99 for them because I wanted to be sure I wasn't getting some knock-off
[13:55] <snap-l> I don't even see the company that I dealt with kin the list.
[14:05] <rick_h_> widox: how are you doing with the leopold keyboard? Still using it?
[14:06] <smoser> snap-l, thanks.
[14:06] <smoser> i have a spare/unused wrt54-gl so i'll probably just set up a repeater or something.
[14:13] <widox> rick_h_: yep
[14:14] <rick_h_> widox: cool
[14:14] <widox> just saw your tweet about double chars; I get that too
[14:14] <widox> mostly with the spacebar though
[14:14] <rick_h_> yea, driving me mad. I think it might be I'm too forceful, used to the harder keys on the unicomp
[14:14] <rick_h_> but i had it before as well.
[14:14] <brousch> You wouldn't get that with an Apple keyboard
[14:14] <widox> the other day I noticedt that amazon has the filco back in stock...
[14:14] <rick_h_> cranky today, no patience for bad tech
[14:15] <rick_h_> yea, just ordered the filco w/blue keys
[14:15] <widox> nice
[14:15] <rick_h_> brousch: no, the apple keyboard would get tossed through my office window
[14:20]  * snap-l would love to see rick_h_'s window bill
[15:42] <derekv> I'll be driving to codemash tonight sometime
[15:42] <rick_h_> derekv: awesome
[15:43] <rick_h_> looks like a empty CHC night with the github drink up and codemash
[15:45] <snap-l> I'll be at CHC tonight
[15:45] <snap-l> Or am I part of the "empty". ;)
[15:48] <derekv> there's a github drinkup in michigan?
[15:49] <snap-l> Too late. You're going to code mash
[15:49] <snap-l> muhahahahaha
[15:49] <derekv> i'm surprised
[15:49] <snap-l> What, that people drink in Michigan?
[15:49] <snap-l> or that github would know where Michigan is on a map?
[15:50] <brousch> We had one a year or two ago in GR
[15:52] <widox> there was one in AA this past summer
[15:54] <derekv> heh, AA drinkup
[15:55] <derekv> oh wait annarbour ;p
[15:55] <widox> hah. :D
[16:11] <Blazeix> yeah, there are 2 or 3 github employees that work remotely from MI
[16:12] <Blazeix> last time i heard
[16:13] <rick_h_> oh oh oh http://new.livestream.com/accounts/2432013/CES2013
[16:15] <brousch> Did you get in on that?
[16:15] <rick_h_> yea
[16:15] <rick_h_> I was a sucker
[16:46] <greg-g> snap-l: yeah, I just think that those specific keyboards are horrible for empirical health reasons (ie: my hands/wrists hurt like hell when I try to use one for longer than 5 minutes)
[16:47] <rick_h_> greg-g: ++ I go nuts when I see a lot of co-workers always living on their laptop keyboards
[16:47] <greg-g> pretty is all well and good, but when it comes to ergonomics, ergonomics should trump pretty
[16:47] <rick_h_> makes me cringe that they use that 100% of the time all the time
[16:47] <greg-g> yep
[16:50] <brousch> rick_h_: I use my laptop 100% of the time
[16:50] <rick_h_> :(
[16:50] <brousch> But I type with about 4 fingers
[17:08] <rick_h_> woot! jan 23rd shipping pebble
[17:09] <rick_h_> e-ink display ftw
[17:13] <rick_h_> sweet, magnetic charge
[17:17] <greg-g> brousch: one of my co-workers who's a big nerd (Wikipedian extraordinare) is in the same boat
[17:19] <greg-g> rick_h_: is this what you're talking about? http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-e-paper-watch-for-iphone-and-android
[17:19] <rick_h_> oooh http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/09/pebble-smartwatch-hands-on-video/
[17:19] <rick_h_> greg-g: yea
[17:19] <greg-g> they better damn deliver with all that money
[17:19] <rick_h_> yea, announced shipping starts at 15k/wk Jan 23rd
[17:20] <greg-g> wow
[17:25] <rick_h_> man, I want the mapmyride app for this!
[17:55] <snap-l> OK, that pebble watch looks cool
[17:55] <rick_h_> yea, I'm excited again. Was getting tired of the delays/etc.
[17:55] <rick_h_> but <3 the idea of controlling phone stuff while it's in my pocket.
[17:55] <rick_h_> especially when biking/working
[17:55] <rick_h_> will need to get a new band for it though me thinks
[17:59] <derekv> i probably should have seen if anyone else was driving down from the area
[18:23] <jcastro> rick_h_: what's the pebble do
[18:23] <rick_h_> jcastro: hooks up to your phone via bluetooth, does time, messages (sms and such) and will have an sdk for hooking up other apps
[18:24] <rick_h_> basically, apps on the phone talk to the watch
[18:24] <rick_h_> comes with a music app to control your music on the phone
[18:25] <rick_h_> their demo had it hooked up via ifttt so that on conditions your watch gets a notification
[18:25] <brousch> I want a big velcro strap to attach my phone to my wrist
[18:26] <rick_h_> yea, I want to keep my phone in my bike bag, or pockets, etc.
[18:26] <brousch> Maybe with a flip-back cover for the phone with a window to show the time
[18:27] <rick_h_> lol
[18:27] <brousch> retractable mini-trackball i can use in my left hand while typing with my right
[18:28] <brousch> I need to kick-starter this
[18:28] <rick_h_> brousch: make it work with the new CES 6" phones
[18:29] <brousch> What's cool is our makerspace is getting 3d printers so I could actually make this crazy stuff
[18:58] <rick_h_> jcastro: good hands on with it http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/9/3855482/pebble-smartwatch-hands-on-video
[21:27] <brousch> Hah, eat it, East siders http://www.forbes.com/pictures/efkk45edkmj/no-7-grand-rapids-mich/
[21:45] <snap-l> Fresno is in unhappiest, iirc.
[21:46] <rick_h_> meh, crazy people are always happy :P
[21:48] <brousch> Not the ones that shoot up places
