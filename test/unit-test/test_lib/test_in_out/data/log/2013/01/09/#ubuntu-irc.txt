[20:43] <Gwaihir> quick question: if I need the meeting bot in a channel that does not have it, how can I do?
[20:43] <Unit193> If it is Ubuntu related, normally you ask AlanBell.
[20:43] <AlanBell> what channel?
[20:44] <Gwaihir> AlanBell, an Italian channel
[20:44] <Gwaihir> #ubuntu-it-meeting
[20:45] <Gwaihir> the Italian logged meeting channel
[20:45] <AlanBell> is it there now?
[20:45] <Gwaihir> yep, it is always there
[20:45] <AlanBell> I mean the bot, I just asked it to join
[20:45] <Gwaihir> oh, yeah
[20:45] <AlanBell> :)
[20:45] <Gwaihir> saw it now
[20:45] <Gwaihir> :-)
[20:45] <Gwaihir> thanks AlanBell
