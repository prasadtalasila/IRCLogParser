[22:05] <FunnyLookinHat> katsumeblisk, It's alive
[22:06] <FunnyLookinHat> Figuring out direction and events and such :)
[22:16] <katsumeblisk> Sweet
[22:17] <FunnyLookinHat> You should sign up for the mailing list and such
[22:17] <FunnyLookinHat> introduce yourself, say what you're interested in seeing, etc.
[22:17] <katsumeblisk> Willdo
[22:17] <FunnyLookinHat> The more bumps we get on that list, the more active the community tends to be.
[22:17] <FunnyLookinHat> right on
[22:21] <Cheri703> FunnyLookinHat: I'm looking at in/after May to move to Denver!
[22:21] <FunnyLookinHat> Cheri703, !!!
[22:21] <FunnyLookinHat> That's awesome!
[22:21] <Cheri703> I'm excited :)
[22:21] <FunnyLookinHat> So Emma managed to convince you, eh?
[22:21] <Cheri703> Exact time frame will depend on when/if units are available in the complex I've been eyeing
[22:21] <FunnyLookinHat> Ah - what part of town?
[22:21] <Cheri703> hehe, I was 90% convinced already, just needed to check it out :)
[22:22] <Cheri703> ha, REALLY REALLY close to sys76 actually
[22:22] <Cheri703> didn't realize it til after I'd looked at the place
[22:22] <FunnyLookinHat> Yeah - I guess it's no competition between Colorado and Ohio...  no offense, but I left the midwest for the same reasons...  :)
[22:22] <Cheri703> On S Quebec Way south of Florida ave
[22:22] <FunnyLookinHat> Oh right on - that's a good area.
[22:22] <Cheri703> yeah, I'm ready to leave here
[22:22] <FunnyLookinHat> Good match of price and proximity to the city.
[22:22] <Cheri703> found a place that'll let me keep all 3 of my dogs too!
[22:22] <FunnyLookinHat> NICE!
[22:22] <FunnyLookinHat> What kind of dogs do you have ?
[22:22] <Cheri703> Yeah "Deerfield Apartments"
[22:22] <Cheri703> 2 beagle mixes, lab-ish something mix
[22:23] <FunnyLookinHat> ah right on
[22:23] <Cheri703> You guys can come over for lunch once I move :)
[22:23] <Cheri703> or after work or something :D
[22:23] <FunnyLookinHat> That's a really great spot for biking too
[22:23] <FunnyLookinHat> the Cherry Creek trail is right near there - and you can ride it all the way downtown
[22:24] <FunnyLookinHat> Hah right on
[22:24] <Cheri703> yeah, and the High Line Canal trail (something like that?) is between parker and s quebec way I think
[22:27] <FunnyLookinHat> Ohhh yeah that one too
