[00:00] <BobJonkman1> Hello Everybodeee!
[00:01] <BobJonkman1> Ubuntu-ca IRC meeting about to get under way.
[00:01] <BobJonkman1> Roll call: F|ReSTaRT jlamothe oracology zul Yompa MagicFab DarwinSurvivor jaguar johanbr mars bregma komputes KombuchaKip ryanakca IdleOne dscassel azend Chex  cyphermox sipherdee txwikinger    egerlach
[00:01] <Chex> hello :)
[00:02] <oracology> BobJonkman1: greetings! i'm unfortunately in the UK and am heading to bed but will idle here to read up in a few hours.
[00:02] <Chex> oracology: and I am actually in Glasgow as well, and will be idling doing the same
[00:02] <BobJonkman1> oracology: No problem.  There'll be logs, and I'll put minutes on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CanadianTeam/Meetings/2013-01-24
[00:02] <BobJonkman1> which is also where today's agenda is
[00:03] <oracology> ahh duly noted. :)
[00:03] <oracology> catch up with you all in a bit then!
[00:03] <BobJonkman1> oracology: Seems you blinked out just as I said " oracology: No problem.  There'll be logs, and I'll put minutes on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CanadianTeam/Meetings/2013-01-24
[00:03] <BobJonkman1> See you!
[00:04] <oracology> BobJonkman1: had to restart Pidgin i'm afraid! but yes, see you !!
[00:04] <BobJonkman1> And Hello Chex
[00:05] <BobJonkman1> dscassel sends word that he's currently engaged in domestic obligations, but he'll pop in from his phone as time permits
[00:06] <BobJonkman1> Let me start with the greeting ritual:  I'm Bob Jonkman, a new contact for Ubuntu Canada, and I'm IRCing from Al Madina Restaurant in Waterloo, Ontario
[00:08] <BobJonkman1> Off the top of the agenda is Current Events
[00:09] <BobJonkman1> In Waterloo we're having an Ubuntu Hour in an hour, right after the IRC meeting.
[00:10] <BobJonkman1> If you're within 50 minutes driving (or biking or walking) distance, c'mon by!
[00:11] <BobJonkman1> And Charles McColm (chaslinux when he's online) has moved the Ubuntu Hour Kitchener to Thursday, 7 February, 6:00pm at Egg Roll King
[00:12] <BobJonkman1> Charles says: http://charlesmccolm.com/2013/01/22/next-ubuntu-hour-date-and-timing/
[00:12] <BobJonkman1> tl;dr: more domestic obligations, and ERK is just too packed on a Friday night
[00:14] <BobJonkman1> If you're wondering how to host an Ubuntu Hour, you can just go to a local coffee shop, restaurant, pub, or other gathering place, announce it (here in IRC, and/or on the mailing list).
[00:15] <BobJonkman1> People show up, and you chat.  About Canadian things like the weather, divisive things like sports, and even Ubuntu stuff!
[00:16] <BobJonkman1> If you take a picture of the event and send it to dscassel he'll send you a handful of Ubuntu-branded DVDs to hand out at your next Ubuntu Hour.
[00:16] <BobJonkman1> This is the famous "CD/DVD Bribery Programme"
[00:18] <BobJonkman1> Other stuff happening: Ubuntu Developer Week, 29-31 January https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek
[00:18] <BobJonkman1> Looks like there are some interesting things on the UDW agenda.
[00:19] <BobJonkman1> All are accessible on #ubuntu-classroom, right here in IRC
[00:19] <hakimsheriff> Hi everyone, sorry I'm late
[00:19] <BobJonkman1> Hi hakimsheriff
[00:19] <BobJonkman1> I'm just working my way through upcoming events...
[00:19] <BobJonkman1> hakimsheriff: Are you still the ubuntu-ca distributor for stickers?
[00:20] <hakimsheriff> Yes I am
[00:20] <BobJonkman1> Can you remind me how that works?
[00:21] <hakimsheriff> Sure, you just send a self addressed stamped envelope to me; my address is on system76.com
[00:21] <hakimsheriff> And I'll send you back the envelope with 4 grey powered by Ubuntu stickers
[00:22] <BobJonkman1> Got a picture?
[00:22] <hakimsheriff> Address is here : https://www.system76.com/community/stickers/ under Canada
[00:23] <hakimsheriff> Sorry, I don't have one now
[00:23] <BobJonkman1> I'll poke around the System76 site, see if there's a sample
[00:24] <hakimsheriff> I'm on my phone, would you like me to try and upload one later?
[00:25] <BobJonkman1> Actually, there's pictures right at the top of https://www.system76.com/community/stickers/
[00:26] <BobJonkman1> The System76 sticker page says you're in Quebec. Do you know of any Ubuntu Hours or other events?
[00:27] <hakimsheriff> The picture on the website is white though, the ones I have are the same but with a grey, metallic looking backing
[00:27] <BobJonkman1> Oooh!  Metalized stickers!
[00:28] <hakimsheriff> I don't really participate with the Ubuntu hours here, so I don't really know
[00:29] <BobJonkman1> No problem.  I was just curious.  Ubuntu-qc has their own schedule and calendar; I can always go look there.
[00:29] <BobJonkman1> So, continuing with events...
[00:29] <BobJonkman1> There's Ubuntu User Days on 9 and 10 February: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UserDays
[00:31] <BobJonkman1> UUD also takes place in #ubuntu-classroom on IRC
[00:31] <BobJonkman1> And at the same time as UUD is Ubuntu LoCo Games.  There's a Web site at http://viajemotu.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/ubuntu-loco-games-2013-1/
[00:32] <BobJonkman1> dscassel was considering setting up a LAN party for Ubuntu-ca, probably at Kwartzlab, the local hackerspace where he's much involved.
[00:33] <BobJonkman1> I haven't really looked through the ULG web site, so I don't know what's required.
[00:33] <BobJonkman1> Sounds cool, tho.
[00:34] <BobJonkman1> Maybe we can organize something here (in IRC) or on the mailing list.
[00:34] <BobJonkman1> People _do_ know about the Ubuntu-ca mailing list, right?
[00:35] <BobJonkman1> You can sign up at https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/ubuntu-ca
[00:36] <BobJonkman1> It's a fairly low-volume mailing list, maybe a couple of messages a week, although there's the odd burst of traffic.
[00:36] <BobJonkman1> I post announcements about Ubuntu Hours, this IRC meeting; it's good medium for keeping the community (Canada-wide!) together.
[00:37] <BobJonkman1> And, yes, it's also used for support questions and answers.
[00:37] <BobJonkman1> That's what community does, provide assistance when needed.
[00:37] <bregma> we try at any rate
[00:38] <BobJonkman1> Yup.  Hi, bregma!
[00:38] <bregma> O/
[00:38] <hakimsheriff> Hello bregma
[00:39] <BobJonkman1> Did you read the Ars Technica article on Ubuntu changing to rolling releases? http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/01/ubuntu-considers-huge-change-that-would-end-traditional-release-cycle/
[00:40] <BobJonkman1> I think it's a great idea. Already I'm getting updates for LibreOffice, Firefox, Thunderbird and many other apps whenever there's an update.  That works for me, and I can see it working for the OS too
[00:41] <bregma> I imagine nothing will be set in stone until after the next UDS, although there was some discussion at the last one
[00:41] <BobJonkman1> My biggest worry is that Ubuntu Release Parties would only happen every other year for an LTS release
[00:41]  * BobJonkman1 still thinks he's a young pup and a party animal
[00:42] <bregma> the bigger problems come with things like new versions of Python or GTK, which can be awkward to roll out gradually
[00:43] <BobJonkman1> Yes, I can imagine the dependency hell when a fundamental building block is rolled out before the application layer is ready.
[00:43] <bregma> but the alphas and betas are already gone, and daily raring Ringtail releases are pretty usable, if you want to see what a rolling release is like
[00:45] <BobJonkman1> Well, if you go to the next UDS and have input, here's one user who's in favour.
[00:45] <bregma> I'll pass that along if I get the chance
[00:46] <BobJonkman1> OK, now to the elephant in the room.  With dscassel not here, I'm not sure how much we can get done on the Canadian Team ReApproval
[00:47] <BobJonkman1> I'm hoping to have a ReApplication Preparation Party in February.
[00:47] <BobJonkman1> Some folks from nearby Listowel have expressed an interest in holding something IRL
[00:48] <BobJonkman1> Mostly, it's finishing off the ReApproval application page at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CanadianTeam/ReApprovalApplication2012
[00:49] <BobJonkman1> Removing old stuff, coming up with a roadmap, and generally making it ready to present to the LoCo Council.
[00:49] <BobJonkman1> If we can get that done in February then we can put in our application for March, and be approved again for the Raring Ringtail release in April
[00:51] <BobJonkman1> Of course, everyone is welcome to fix up the ReApprovalApplication page at any time.  No need for a format get-together
[00:51] <BobJonkman1> But things are more fun when done in a group when there's pizza
[00:52] <hakimsheriff> So things the team has done and will do?
[00:52] <hakimsheriff> Or just what has already been done
[00:53] <BobJonkman1> Both, really.
[00:54] <BobJonkman1> I've added the things we've done that I know about, but I'm sure there's more.  F'instance, there's a spot on the page that mentions stickers that needs fixing up
[00:54] <hakimsheriff> I'll get right on it ;)
[00:55] <BobJonkman1> But also a roadmap for the future.  I'd like to have some advice on how to attract more people, how to put Ubuntu in the mainstream.
[00:55] <BobJonkman1> For a country with 35 million people, we're getting pretty poor turnout for IRC meetings, for example.
[00:56] <BobJonkman1> Mind you, I don't know how the other LoCos are for attendance.
[00:57] <BobJonkman1> I sat in on the last LoCo Council IRC meeting, where czjakowski (sp?) said that 300+ members in LaunchPad is pretty good.
[00:57] <BobJonkman1> Also, we really need to do something about http://ubuntu-ca.org
[00:58] <BobJonkman1> I can't get logged in (something to do with LDAP integration to LaunchPad), and that site is terribly out-of-date.
[00:58] <BobJonkman1> I'm thinking that if we can't get it fixed in time for the ReApproval, we should remove mention of it on the Ubuntu Wiki, and use the Wiki for that information instead.
[00:59] <BobJonkman1> It's mostly event announcments, which we're already doing on the LoCo event site anyway
[01:00] <hakimsheriff> If we do get the website up and running, I would be glad to keep it up to date with all the events we talk about in the mailing list
[01:01] <BobJonkman1> hakimsheriff: Can you get logged in? I seem to recall you had admin access at one time...
[01:01] <hakimsheriff> I remember being given access, but I was never able to log in
[01:02] <BobJonkman1> Yeah, a common problem.
[01:02] <BobJonkman1> I may see txwikinger soon; I'll ask him in person
[01:02] <BobJonkman1> (txwikinger hosts the site)
[01:03] <dscassel> thanks for doing all this, Bob.
[01:04] <BobJonkman1> OK, looks like the hour is up.  I've been hogging the channel long enough -- anyone got anyting else?
[01:04] <BobJonkman1> O hai, dscassel
[01:04]  * dscassel has a minute while Ellen is getting ready. don't let me interrupt.
[01:05] <BobJonkman1> I think we're close to done.
[01:05] <dscassel> I'll get a Sunday at Ubuntu hour later. :)
[01:06] <dscassel> er, summary. :P
[01:06] <BobJonkman1> OK, see you when you get here!
[01:07] <BobJonkman1> Schawarma Poutine is an excellent choice today.
[01:08] <BobJonkman1> All rightie then.
[01:08]  * BobJonkman1 pounds gavel
[01:08] <hakimsheriff> OK well bye everyone, got to go, have a ton of homework to do
[01:08] <BobJonkman1> Next IRC meeting should be on 28 February, the fourth week of the month.
[01:09] <BobJonkman1> Bye hakimsheriff!
[01:09] <BobJonkman1> See y'all later!
[01:09]  * BobJonkman1 needs to unplug the tethered phone to call home...
[01:09] <bregma> BobJonkman1, thanks for hosting
[01:10] <BobJonkman1> You're welcome, bregma!
