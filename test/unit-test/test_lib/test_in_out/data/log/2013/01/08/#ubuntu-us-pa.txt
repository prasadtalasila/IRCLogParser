[15:18] <ChinnoDog> Morning.
[21:17] <MobileTurkey> okay, so I am going to meet with someone about a job, intra-drexel, and they asked for a resume... which I don't have.
[21:17] <MobileTurkey> should I just say I don't have one? should I make it up?
[21:19] <patbarron> If it were me, I'd put one together.  Where I am, I was recently in discussions with two different organizations within my company about a transfer, and both wanted to see a resume before they even tallked to me.
[21:20] <patbarron> I found some OpenOffice resume template somewhere out on The Interwebz, and used it.  Formatting is always the toughest part of this for me.  Surprised nobody's made some open source program where you put in your employment history and such, and out pops a nicely formatted resume...
