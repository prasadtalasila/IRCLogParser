[08:34] <diplo> Morning
[08:36] <knightwise> hey diplo  !
[08:36] <knightwise> how are you :)
[08:43] <popey> morning
[08:45] <diplo> Morning knightwise, sorry work call :)
[08:45] <diplo> Good thanks, albeit a tad cold this morning! And you ?
[08:47] <TheOpenSourcerer> Morning all.
[08:59] <aptanet> TheOpenSourcerer, a cold an icy morning it is too
[08:59] <nigelb> Morning popey
[08:59] <TheOpenSourcerer> Hi aptanet, morning popey
[08:59] <nigelb> Hey TheOpenSourcerer
[08:59] <TheOpenSourcerer> hey nigelb how's it going? long time no see
[09:00] <nigelb> TheOpenSourcerer: Going good. I'm in London!
[09:00] <TheOpenSourcerer> Cool.
[09:00] <popey> yo yo yo
[09:00] <TheOpenSourcerer> For good, or just visiting?
[09:00] <nigelb> just visiting.
[09:00] <nigelb> I'll be here for 3 weeks, I hope to meet as many of you guys as I can manage ;)
[09:01] <popey> London all of that time or moving about?
[09:01] <TheOpenSourcerer> That sounds like a plan.
[09:01] <nigelb> Cambridge for a week.
[09:01] <nigelb> Otherwise, I'll be in London most days I think.
[09:05] <TheOpenSourcerer> popey: Ever written any tips on screencasting?
[09:08] <popey> nah, they're mostly in my head
[09:08] <TheOpenSourcerer> OK - ta.
[09:09] <popey> anything specific you were after?
[09:09] <aptanet> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ScreencastTeam/RecordingScreencasts
[09:09] <TheOpenSourcerer> Not really. I have a new module for vtiger  I want to screencast.
[09:09] <TheOpenSourcerer> Thanks aptanet
[09:10] <popey> that page is old and outdated
[09:10] <aptanet> by popey ;)
[09:10] <aptanet> yes, the three on your blog are a bit old too
[09:10]  * popey brainstorms
[09:10] <TheOpenSourcerer> I was just going to write some script notes first then do it.
[09:10] <TheOpenSourcerer> On a clean desktop
[09:10] <aptanet> I've found Kazam better than record my desktop
[09:11] <aptanet> although it is prone to stopping responding I find
[09:12] <popey> http://beta.etherpad.org/p/screencasting
[09:12] <popey> lets go!
[09:12] <TheOpenSourcerer> :-)
[09:13] <TheOpenSourcerer> That etherpad keeps dropping out.
[09:17] <davmor2> Morning all
[09:18] <popey> strange, fine here
[09:18] <TheOpenSourcerer> It's OK now seemingly.
[09:19] <awilkins> Not having problems
[09:26] <diplo> I still love watching multiple edits on documents, its the future :)
[09:27] <aptanet> when you're thinking about typing something and it appears from somewhere else if fun!
[09:27] <TheOpenSourcerer> Nice, one of our VMs has a Load Avg of 68 :-)
[09:27] <TheOpenSourcerer> bloody apache and WP again.

[09:32] <popey> after you update on raring
[09:32] <JamesTait> Good morning all! :-D
[09:33] <diplo> OCD kicking in again popey :)
[09:33]  * diplo is debating writing a phone app..
[09:33]  * JamesTait really should update to Raring. Maybe over the weekend.
[09:33] <diplo> Any one here tried writing one yet apart from sil ?

[09:34] <JamesTait> Howzit davmor2! :)
[09:37] <hoover> hi folks
[09:38] <knightwise> hey hoover
[09:39] <timp> Hi, I tried to install 10.04 from dvd on external optical drive on a MacBook Pro, last years (non-retina) model. It nearly worked: i even heard the little drum role, but the screen remained completely blank.
[09:39] <timp> Any suggestions?
[09:39] <knightwise> 10.04 ?
[09:39] <timp> yes
[09:39] <knightwise> 12.04 works out of the box.
[09:40] <timp> Doh, sorry, 12.04
[09:40] <timp> Nope#
[09:40] <knightwise> http://maketecheasier.com/install-ubuntu-12-10-in-macbook-air/2012/11/08
[09:40] <knightwise> thats odd.
[09:40] <knightwise> are you using the amd/mac iso ?
[09:41] <timp> The standard amd iso
[09:41] <timp> thanks for the link, I will try again tonight.
[09:43] <knightwise> could be a no-acpi settins in grub
[09:43] <knightwise> i had that problem too
[09:43] <knightwise> if you hit me up on facebook or google+ i"ll get you in touch with one of my listeners who had the same problem.

[10:28] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[10:33] <popey> yo
[10:34] <brobostigon> morning popey
[10:35] <bigcalm_laptop> Good morning peeps :)
[10:35] <brobostigon> morning bigcalm_laptop
[10:36] <bigcalm_laptop> Hi brobostigon
[10:43] <brobostigon> ok, lets say. i used get-iplayer, to download something to my rpi, how would you stream that from there to another machine on the same network, whith the rpi being headless ?
[10:44] <gord> smbfs? ssh+ftp?
[10:45] <diplo> I have a similar setup, albeit a microserver and yeah as gord says I stick it in a samba share
[10:45] <diplo> and point xbmc in my case to said samba share
[10:46] <TheOpenSourcerer> brobostigon: dlna, rygel?
[10:46] <gord> is what i do, i've also used a upnp setup in the past too, which worked well and something i want to explore in the future but xbmc was a bit buggy with it at the time
[10:46] <brobostigon> two questions, will it download the whole file before playback? and how can i get it to do that without having to download said file wholly or partially first ?
[10:46] <TheOpenSourcerer> dlna/upnp I think is a proper streaming service.
[10:47] <TheOpenSourcerer> It works on my TV from my home server.
[10:47] <brobostigon> ok, let me make notes, and research those possibilities.
[10:47] <gord> it won't download the whole file before playback, unless your video player is beyond terrible
[10:47] <TheOpenSourcerer> If you are using a Pi though you probably don't want to do real-time encoding ;-)
[10:48]  * bigcalm_laptop pokes gord
[10:48] <brobostigon> gord: ok, i just remeber some attempts at this before. doing that,
[10:48]  * bigcalm_laptop pokes mrevell
[10:48] <gord> only thing i have seen download the whole file before playback is a sftp filesystem extension for windows that would download the files to a temporary directory before letting the thing open it
[10:48]  * gord is poked
[10:48] <mrevell> AH, hey bigcalm_laptop. I got back late from a meet-up in Manchester last night so I'm still at home. Are you all there?
[10:49] <brobostigon> gord: ah,
[10:50] <bigcalm_laptop> mrevell: davmor2 and myself are here
[10:50] <bigcalm_laptop> mrevell: you're welcome to join us
[10:51] <brobostigon> TheOpenSourcerer: good point, yes.
[10:51] <davmor2> mrevell: yeah come you can tell us all about your new job and the globe trotting that you are doing :)
[10:52] <mrevell> heh :)
=== Hornet- is now known as Hornet
[11:18] <brobostigon> minidlna seems a good candidate, for what i am looking for.
[11:19] <bigcalm_laptop> Is that the mysql drop in replacement?
[11:19] <bigcalm_laptop> Oh, maybe not. I think I'm still a little tired today
[11:20] <SuperMatt> no, you're thinking of maria
[11:21] <SuperMatt> the only thing that's stopping me from dropping postgres on unsuspecting asses over here is bloody wordpress
[11:24] <SuperMatt> though I guess if I can prove that wordpress works fine with maria, then I might be able to convince the devs to make the switch
[11:33] <bigcalm_laptop> SuperMatt: drizzle is another drop in replacement for mysql
[11:34] <SuperMatt> considering that fedora 19 may go maria (if it ever gets out of the door), and it's being developed by formers mysql devs, maria might be the better option
[11:45] <SuperMatt> hah, silly me
[11:45] <SuperMatt> the maria db wikipedia page says wordpress is "officially supported"
[11:45] <SuperMatt> I'm just going to have a look around to see where I can find that "official" confirmation
[11:47] <SuperMatt> brilliant, zend support it too, so I could move everything across the maria 10
[11:47] <SuperMatt> or just keep maria for wordpress and use postgres for everything else
[11:56] <hoover> Should be ok to use maria as it's a drop-in binary replacement for mysql
[12:13] <SuperMatt> well, currently it is ;)
[12:13] <SuperMatt> I don't imagine that if maria and mysql were no longer compatible that wordpress would stop working
[12:13] <SuperMatt> it's not like wordpress sites need to worry about transactions, etc
[12:34] <brobostigon> what the best format for videos to be in, so that dlna can playback and stream them properly ?
[12:35] <brobostigon> btw, i got minidlna up and running properly, :)
[12:35] <popey> i dont think dnla cares
[12:35] <popey> the client might
[12:35] <brobostigon> hmm, get-iplayer and minidlna end, it is a .flv
[12:35] <popey> h264 seems to be the codec of choice which plays on most things
[12:36] <popey> flv is the container
[12:36] <brobostigon> ok.
[12:36] <popey> what's inside it?
[12:36] <popey> get_iplayer usually converts .flv to .mp4 when it finishes iirc
[12:36] <brobostigon> how do i find out from cli ?
[12:36] <popey> mplayer will tell you
[12:37] <Azelphur> doesn't iplayer serve mp4 as it's high quality option?
[12:37] <brobostigon> it didnt convert it to mp4 for some reason.
[12:37] <popey> do you have libav/ffmpeg installed?
[12:37] <popey> if not it wont
[12:37] <gord> most things that can play h264 can also play flv though
[12:37] <brobostigon> popey: ah, ok. let me try again then.
[12:38] <popey> Selected video codec: [ffh264] vfm: ffmpeg (FFmpeg H.264)
[12:38] <popey> Selected audio codec: [ffac3] afm: ffmpeg (FFmpeg AC-3)
[12:38] <popey> for example is what you might get from mplayer
[12:39] <brobostigon> i have installed ffmpeg now, so will try and pull a different video off iplayer, and see whats happens.
[12:40] <popey> or just manually convert one you already have
[12:41] <popey> i think get_iplayer just changes the container, not the internal codecs
[12:41] <brobostigon> i will have to do that yes.
[12:41] <brobostigon> ah.
[12:41] <popey> what are you playing them with?
[12:41] <popey> i.e. what frontend?
[12:41] <brobostigon> mediahouse on my nexus7. is the first client i tried.
[12:42] <einonm> gord: watch out though, flv is a container, whereas h.264 is a video codec, so there is quite a difference
[12:44] <popey> https://www.theyetee.com/
[12:44] <popey> oops
[12:45] <brobostigon> spoton popey , ffmpeg was the problem.
[12:45] <popey> cool
[12:48] <brobostigon> WOOP
[13:06] <brobostigon> it is working really quite well. i am impressed.
[13:18] <knightwise> hey popey brobostigon
[13:19] <brobostigon> hey knightwise
[13:27] <knightwise> hmm.. i'm using the nxfree nomachine client / server
[13:27] <knightwise> but it doesnt seem to like unity very much :(
[13:28] <brobostigon> i wonder, if there is an risk of the rpi overheating and burning,? hmmm,
[13:34] <knightwise> is there still an lts supported version without unity (with standard gnome ?)
[13:34] <knightwise> or has that also gone the way of the dodo ?
[13:35] <brobostigon> standard gnome is there is the repos, and i beleieve there is a gnome-ubuntu remix.
[13:36] <knightwise> standard gnome  ? but thats gnome 3 ..right ?
[13:37] <brobostigon> yes.
[13:41] <knightwise> hmm.. dunno if the Nomachine client likes that any better
[13:42] <diplo> knightwise: xfce ?
[13:46] <knightwise> sure ,b ut then you need to hack some preferences into the nxclient and i've tried several things.
[13:49] <BigRedS> I'm after an XMPP client that supports a few different accounts being configured, but lets me treat them separately, anyone know of any?
[13:49] <BigRedS> so (easy) different statuses/messages for each, ideally separate contact lists. I'm thinking basically Pidgin's interface but tabbed...
[13:54] <knightwise> BigRedS: Centerim ?
[13:55] <BigRedS> knightwise: oooh, perhaps. Hadn't considered text-mode.
[13:55] <BigRedS> thansk!
[13:56] <BigRedS> haha, you can judge software's maintenance activity by which woman is in the photo in the background of the screenshot...
[14:00] <knightwise> ah , i got it
[14:00] <awilkins> BigRedS, Are we saying the maintenance is inversely proportional to how attractive the screenshot people are?
[14:00] <knightwise> need to specify what desktop the nomachine client should launch
[14:00] <knightwise> works nog
[14:00] <knightwise> now
[14:00] <awilkins> BigRedS, ie ; super hot - obv. rubbish software being covered up by glitz?
[14:07] <knightwise> whow
[14:07] <knightwise> remote desktop with NXclient (running XFCE on the far end) is FAST !
[14:08] <BigRedS> awilkins: haha, nah just which woman is in the background. Though I'm not sure who it would be now...
[14:09] <knightwise> what screenshot are you referring to ?
[14:10] <BigRedS> http://www.centerim.org/index.php/File:Centerim-screenshot.png
[14:10] <awilkins> An old shot of Alysson Hannigan
[14:11] <awilkins> From this we can infer the software is maintained by people who liked Buffy the Vampire Slayer
[14:12] <knightwise> aah the allison hannigan wallpaper ?
[14:12]  * knightwise had big time nerd crush on her
[14:12] <knightwise> and i still think she's hot
[14:12] <knightwise> had her on my wallpaper for a long time.
[14:12] <knightwise> Currently boasting artwork from "the mad shipyards" (google to find out)
[14:12] <awilkins> She gets hotter as time goes on, if anything
[14:13] <knightwise> indeed
[14:13] <knightwise> do i like her in ginger more then in dark brown
[14:13] <awilkins> Her turn in "How I Met Your Mother" is nothing short of inspired
[14:13] <dwatkins> Gillian Anderson is awesome
[14:13] <knightwise> gillian anderson ?
[14:13] <awilkins> X-Files Scully
[14:13] <dwatkins> yeah awilkins
[14:13] <knightwise> oh Skully
[14:13] <awilkins> I had the issue of FHM that was trading for £10 a copy on ebay
[14:13] <dwatkins> Karin Gillian isn't bad either, can you detect a theme?
[14:13] <knightwise> yeah .. she's like the big sis everybody wanted as a kid
[14:14] <awilkins> The one with Gillian Anderson in her underwear
[14:14] <knightwise> http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CHlMXEsEMkY/UNQOSoSLYII/AAAAAAAAAyc/DVc3N2UBPzM/s1600/gillian_anderson_4.jpg
[14:14] <knightwise> sooo pretty
[14:21] <knightwise> cool :) Lxde remote desktop is lightning fast :)
[14:22] <SuperMatt> I would love if someone in canonical worked on a proper rdp contender for linux
[14:22] <BigRedS> ssh -x
[14:22]  * BigRedS doesn't use rdp
[14:22] <SuperMatt> I know we have x-forwarding, but it's not the same as having a whole desktop running quite fast
[14:22] <SuperMatt> and I mean faster than vnc too
[14:23] <SuperMatt> I had to work from home on monday and vnc was painful
[14:23] <dwatkins> NX and VNC are fine for what I need
[14:28] <AlanBell> SuperMatt: I suspect someone will do something with wayland
[14:29] <AlanBell> http://wayland.freedesktop.org/faq.html#heading_toc_j_8
[14:29] <knightwise> SuperMatt: you need to connect to a windows machine ?
[14:30] <knightwise> I am currently using NXFree , but thats not realy an 'remote desktop' client
[14:30] <knightwise> more of a terminal server one
[14:32] <knightwise> ha : )
[14:32] <knightwise> used NXfree to connect to a virtual machine i'm running at home
[14:33] <knightwise> virtual machine is also running with another user logged in
[14:33] <knightwise> using vnc to connect to the other X session of that user :)
[14:34] <dwatkins> I often use NX to remote control my machine at home, especially as it has less port restrictions than the office network
[14:36] <SuperMatt> knightwise: no, not connecting to windows.
[14:36] <SuperMatt> RDP just seems to do remote displays way better than vnc
[14:36] <SuperMatt> xfordwarding is nice for the odd app or two, but it can't replace being able to access your hole desktop
[14:40] <awilkins> I think there's an RDP server for Linux somewhere, when I mention it here people link it
[14:40] <awilkins> http://www.xrdp.org/
[14:40]  * SuperMatt nods
[14:40] <SuperMatt> I've never managed to get that to load unity though
[14:41] <SuperMatt> could just be me
[14:41] <knightwise> SuperMatt: i know you'll swear at me but .. teamviewer isn't so bad
[14:43] <SuperMatt> maybe I should just try xrdp when I get home

[16:01] <andrewebdev> I've just finished setting up for myself a new pc, and I'm wondering if it's possible to just copy my private ssh key to the new computer, from my old laptop, or should I generate a new one?
[16:01] <brobostigon> another question, what controls inside dlna, the quality of playback on the client ? is it directly the source video quality?
[16:02] <popey> andrewebdev: is your old laptop being decommissioned?
[16:02] <solarcloud_3srcn> AlanBell: Well, at least the #channel is going, at last, today .. thanx everyone.
[16:03] <andrewebdev> popey, I am planning to still use it
[16:03] <popey> if so, I'd copy ~/.ssh over, if not, and you're keeping both machines, I'd create a new one
[16:03] <andrewebdev> ok thx
[16:03] <popey> so if you lose one machine (or it gets stolen or compromised) you can remove that one key from remote machines and keep the safe one
[16:03] <andrewebdev> ah i see that makes sense yes
[16:03] <einonm1> brobostigon: I'm not sure if dlna dlna adaptive streaming
[16:03] <andrewebdev> ta :)
[16:03] <einonm1> ...dlna has adaptive streaming
[16:04] <brobostigon> einonm1: so it adjusts to the client ?
[16:04] <einonm1> to the link speed, if it is present. As I said, I'm not sure if DLNA does that.
[16:05] <brobostigon> einonm1: ok, thank you,
[16:05] <einonm1> basically, it first tests if it can shove the best quality stream down the pipe - if it can't it tries the next best etc.
[16:05] <brobostigon> ah, i see.
[16:05] <einonm1> but you need either multiple streams of different quality, or (like on blu-ray) a codec that can cope with adaptive bitrates
[16:06] <brobostigon> good point,
[16:08] <popey> brobostigon: what client are you using?
[16:09] <brobostigon> popey: mediahouse on android 4.2.1
[16:09] <popey> any good?
[16:10] <brobostigon> not bad, weird menu system, but seems to work well enough,
[16:10] <brobostigon> it was simply the first one i found, so i choose it by chance.

[17:22] <aptanet> getting slightly annoyed with this wireless card dropping connection seemingly randomly
[17:22] <aptanet> each time I have to disable and re-enable wireless to authenticate again :(
[17:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> aptanet: Just outta interest has the novatech laptop/ultrabook gotta Wireless disable screen option in the Bios, like dell's has ?? http://goo.gl/rZKkF . Just askin'     .
[17:25] <aptanet> good question, without rebooting I'm not sure!
[17:26] <solarcloud_3srcn> aptanet: Crumb.s .. hope I've not started anything, Oh dear.
[17:26] <popey> aptanet: which wireless device is it?
[17:26] <aptanet> not sure about the BIOS, but there's a hotkey on the keyboard - and it works
[17:26] <aptanet> Ralink corp. Device 3290
[17:27] <aptanet> I've had to update the kernel and install firmware to get it working
[17:29] <aptanet> that said, my netbook does exactly the same thing with the stock kernel and an express card nic
[17:30] <popey> aptanet: 12.10?

[18:58] <cocoa117> when using nfsv4 to export filesystem to linux client. does the locally bind filesystem automatically export?
[18:59] <cocoa117> e.g. /media/pool/family on /srv/sto/home/pans/multimedia type none (rw,bind)
[19:00] <cocoa117> so when i exports /srv/sto/home as root to clients, do i get access to the /meida/pool/family folder?

[23:04] <popey> wossat?
[23:06] <Azelphur> half life 1 :P
[23:06] <directhex> popey, hl1, just released for linux and osx
[23:06] <directhex> as in 11 minutes ago
[23:06] <Azelphur> WHAT
[23:06]  * Azelphur downloads hard.
[23:06] <popey> hah
[23:12] <Azelphur> aww, I only have half life source.

[23:13] <Azelphur> yea just takes me to the buy page
[23:21] <solarcloud_3srcn> I remember a lot of this :: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/55128914/Lubuntu%20docs/Half%20Life%20Loading%20Bar.PNG
[23:23] <directhex> solarcloud_3srcn, then you're a youngun. there was no bar like that in pre-steam half-life
[23:23] <directhex> remember, this is a game from 1998
[23:24] <solarcloud_3srcn> mmmmphf .... '98 tech .. What's the big deal about then ??
[23:25] <cambrianExplosio> Hi everyone, is anyone using Ubuntu on a Macbook here?
[23:25] <solarcloud_3srcn> not me ..
[23:26] <directhex> well, there was no steam. half-life came instead with "sierra utilities". which had a minor bug whereby it would delete all your files when you uninstalled it
[23:26] <directhex> half-life patch day was hell. a 45-meg patch on 28.8k dialup was lame
[23:26] <solarcloud_3srcn> Sounds familiar.
[23:31] <solarcloud_3srcn> mmmmhpf .... '98 tech .. What's the big deal about *today* ,then ??
[23:33] <directhex> solarcloud_3srcn, well, it's been ported to linux and osx, and released within the last hour
[23:34] <directhex> part of why that's interesting is a) steam for mac came out years ago, yet never saw ports of hl1-based games, and b) the rather messy history of the unreleased osx port
[23:35] <solarcloud_3srcn> screw this |||||||||||||||||||||||||||| I'm seeing what www.phoronix.com says ...
[23:42] <popey> that's an interesting point directhex, I hadn't considered that.
[23:42] <popey> we're up to what? 60+ Linux games on steam now?
[23:42] <directhex> popey, fully working, or in the CDR?
[23:43] <popey> both?
[23:45] <directhex> 45 and 84 respectively
[23:46] <directhex> YMMV. IANAL. IDDQD.
[23:46] <directhex> i have 53 of them
