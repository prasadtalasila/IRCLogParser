[17:13] <xnox> mpt: mpt: I made a small surgery on the usb-creator to allow it flashing nexus7 tablets. I did have to remove a few things that didn't make sense in the 'nexus7' mode.
[17:14] <xnox> But I do wonder if/where is usb-creator design. And whether you want to see / tweak / change UI for flashing devices.
[17:14]  * xnox should create screenshots.
[17:23] <mpt> xnox, ev and I both remember there being at least wireframes for it. But I don't see them on the wiki anywhere.
[17:24] <xnox> mpt: hmm... it was a while. I also had a vague idea that I saw wireframes about it.
[17:25] <xnox> mpt: I'll make screenshots and / or come in to show the changes. And you can ponder about it, if you have time for it =)
[17:27] <mpt> xnox, <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/USBInstallationImages> has Ascii art from before I redesigned it
[17:29] <xnox> mpt: thanks =)
