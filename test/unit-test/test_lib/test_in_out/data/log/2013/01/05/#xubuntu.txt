[02:45] <ball> I just mounted a disk that used to be the system disk on a Xubuntu box
[02:45] <ball> I see lots of directories but no files.
[02:46] <ball> Oh hang on, there are files on there.
[02:46] <ball> ...just not in the user's home directory
[02:47] <ball> I must have cleared it out before removing the disk.
[02:49] <ball> What would I use to partition a hard disk on Xubuntu?
[03:00] <kgb> the installer, to empty space

[03:02] <Liquidedge> I upgraded to 12.10 and now I can't see the "Network" option in Thunar.
[03:02] <Liquidedge> any ideas why that might be?
[03:02] <grok_> ball, Maybe, the home was mounted in /etc/fstab from another partition or disk?
[03:05] <kgb> Liquidedge: maybe http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2076820
[03:06] <Liquidedge> Everything on gvfs is installed in Synaptic.
[03:06] <kgb> hehe looks like he's got a blog http://surffingtoday.blogspot.com/2012/10/ubuntu-forums-xubuntu-1210-upgrade_26.html
[03:07] <kgb> or im just being blind again
[03:07] <ball> kgb: thanks
[03:07]  * kgb hides
[03:10] <ball> grok_: Would it have subdirectories inside it if it were a mountpoint though?
[03:10] <grok_> You can mount something over a non-empty directory, the contents of the directory will be hidden by the mount.
[03:12] <ball> I'm assuming that I backed everything up before pulling the drive.  I'm using dd to write zeroes over the whole thing now.
[03:12] <grok_> Hm, No need to zero it all, just the first 512 MBs.
[03:12] <grok_> ... if your intention is just to reformat.
[03:12] <grok_> sorry, the first 512 bytes.
[03:13] <ball> grok_: I may do.  For now I'm just doing an informal inventory of disks.  I'm zeroing out the ones I might recycle, just in case I never get around to reusing them.
[03:21] <Liquidedge> Just re-installed gvfs and still have the same problem.

[09:57] <aLeSD> hi all
[09:58] <aLeSD> Is there a way to make my xubuntu 12.10 do not ask me for the keyring passwd each time I logon ?
[10:00] <grok_> alesd: http://xubuntu.org/news/faq-1204-precise/ point 7
[10:00] <grok_> Alternatively, when reinstalling, choose "Login automatically" from within the installer wizard.
[10:00] <aLeSD> grok_: it's not the auologin
[10:00] <aLeSD> is after I login... I open the browser
[10:01] <aLeSD> and a window pops up telling me to ensert the password to unlock the keyring
[10:13] <grok_> oh I'm sorry then, I don't know what is a keyring actually.
