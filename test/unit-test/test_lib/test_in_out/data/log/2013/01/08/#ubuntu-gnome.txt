[21:06] <darkxst> ricotz, can you rebuild js188 with e4x enabled
[21:32] <ricotz> darkxst, e4x (xml support) is enabled by default
[21:36] <darkxst> ricotz, hmm ok, well its not working for some reason
[21:39] <ricotz> darkxst, are you forced to replace the current handling to port it?
[21:40] <ricotz> (if this is gjs related)
[21:40] <darkxst> yes gjs related
[21:41] <darkxst> it was removed in 18, so should work in 17
[21:41] <darkxst> Gio overrides make use of it though
[21:44] <ricotz> ah i see
[21:44] <ricotz> so an alternative is needed (soon) then
[21:44] <darkxst> yes
[21:46] <ricotz> ok, anyway, it is enabled in the 188 build and is suppose to work then
