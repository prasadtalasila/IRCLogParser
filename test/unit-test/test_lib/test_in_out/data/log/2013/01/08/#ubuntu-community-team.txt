[00:12] <mhall119> daker: did I miss anything interesting on that lice CNet feed?
[00:17] <mhall119> oh lord
[00:17] <mhall119> live video
[00:17] <mhall119> not lice
[00:17] <mhall119> :(
[00:48] <daker> mhall119: no idea :)
[00:59] <bkerensa> mhall119: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SoftwareCenter/AppPromotion
[00:59] <bkerensa> says Jono is working on Ubuntu Button for FF and I was discussing it with one of the people at Mozilla who uses Ubuntu and works on the Team that would approve it
[01:01] <mhall119> bkerensa: ah, great, I think the problem before was that we weren't closely following their release cycle, but we are now
[01:01] <bkerensa> mhall119: So I think it goes a little further than that :)
[01:01]  * bkerensa needs to find the bug he has open in Bugzilla
[01:03] <mhall119> bkerensa: is there still some concern that they have?
[01:05] <bkerensa> mhall119: So it appears the issue would be that its a lot of work :)
[01:05] <bkerensa> mhall119: I have a bug ID if you would like to comment on it
[01:06] <mhall119> sure
[01:10] <bkerensa> mhall119: <ckoehler> bkerensa I don't think it makes sense to do the work required to make that happen
[01:10] <bkerensa> <ckoehler> our download pages are very fragile
[01:10] <bkerensa> <ckoehler> ubuntu users will already have firefox
[01:10] <bkerensa> mhall119: but the bug idea is here https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=763007
[01:10] <ubot2> Mozilla bug 763007 in General "Firefox.com lacks "Download for Ubuntu" button but offers Generic Linux Download" [Enhancement,New]
[01:20] <mhall119> bkerensa: you'd want to confirm, but I don't think Kubuntu, Xubuntu, or other flavors and derivatives come with Firefox by default
[01:21] <bkerensa> mhall119: Yeah but this is a Ubuntu button not for other projects right?
[01:22] <mhall119> bkerensa: the button works on any Ubuntu flavor or derivative that uses our archives
[01:22] <bkerensa> mhall119: I see
[01:23] <mhall119> it points to apps.ubuntu.com, which lists things in the archives
[01:23] <mhall119> so technically the button works for any OS, it just takes you to a page about the app with screenshots, rating and reviews, and a download button
[01:25] <bkerensa> mhall119: the localization and detection issue I think it what the blocker would be
[01:26] <mhall119> what's the issue?
[01:27] <bkerensa> mhall119: Getting people to localize the content and sorting how to detect Ubuntu users from other Linux users
[01:27] <bkerensa> we cannot blanket offer the Ubuntu button to Redhat or Fedora users
[01:27] <bkerensa> Firefox does not have a header right now that separates it from Fedora or other Distros
[01:28] <bkerensa> mhall119: oh it looks like it was actually re-added
[01:29] <bkerensa> mhall119: but I'm not sure that Chrome or Chromium or browsers offered by Xubuntu/Lubuntu/Kubuntu have the Ubuntu field in the UA string
[01:29] <bkerensa> so we would only be presenting this button to Ubuntu users that already have Firefox?
[01:32] <bkerensa> mhall119: So Chrome/Chromium present "(X11; Linux xARCH)" where FF does "(X11; Ubuntu; Linux; rv VERSION xARCH)"
[01:33] <mhall119> bkerensa: why can't you offer a page with Ubuntu *and* Fedora buttons
[01:33] <mhall119> ?
[01:34] <mhall119> one page, multiple buttons?
[01:34] <mhall119> or multiple buttons on a side-bar
[01:34] <mhall119> or something
[01:34] <bkerensa> thats where the work comes in
[01:34] <mhall119> anybody that provides Firefox packages themselves and provides you a button
[01:35] <bkerensa> and then we would have to localize
[01:35] <bkerensa> we would also have to localize the ubuntu button since we offer the website in every language under the sun
[01:35] <bkerensa> mhall119: I would like to see it
[01:35] <mhall119> hmm, imbrandon made a css version of the download butotn, that would be localizable
[01:36] <bkerensa> but convincing people to "do work" for something like this... Unless we could convince Ubuntu Contributors to pick up the work and submit patches
[01:37] <mhall119> bkerensa: what if we offered an array of images in different languages?
[01:37] <daker> bkerensa: they use django ?
[01:37] <bkerensa> daker: let me check the repo
[01:38] <mhall119> daker: Mozilla uses a lot of Django, yes
[01:39] <daker> so it will be easy with imbrandon button {% trans "Download for ubuntu" %}
[01:43] <mhall119> daker: if that site is Django and translted that way, yes
[01:47] <mhall119> bkerensa: if pre-translated images would make it possible for them to put the button on their pages, I'll work internally to get those made
[01:49] <bkerensa> mhall119: Well I will try and push it
[01:49] <bkerensa> :)
[01:49] <mhall119> bkerensa: let me know if there are any other roadblocks and we'll try to overcome them as well
[01:50] <bkerensa> mhall119: asking someone now
[01:50] <bkerensa> mhall119:
[01:50] <bkerensa> <bkerensa> ckoehler: someone at Canonical asked
[01:50] <bkerensa> <bkerensa> :P
[01:50] <bkerensa> <ckoehler> bkerensa Probably not at this stage.
[01:50] <bkerensa> so looks like no
[01:51] <bkerensa> mhall119: there was more but I had to PM you the rest since it is not something that should be public
[01:52] <bkerensa> daker: https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock <-- django
[01:52] <bkerensa> LD
[01:54] <daker> so mhall119 i guess imbrandon's button will work with {% trans %}
[01:55] <daker> bkerensa: on which page it needs to be shown ?
[01:56] <bkerensa> daker my understanding is that Ubuntu Comm Team wanted it on front page
[01:56] <bkerensa> :)
[01:56] <bkerensa> which is the only place we offer the main download button
[01:58] <daker> bkerensa: https://github.com/mozilla/bedrock/blob/master/apps/firefox/templates/firefox/new.html
[01:58] <imbrandon> if there is something I can do / change to help out with it mhall119 / daker just let me know
[02:01] <imbrandon> it could be a trivial server side script (js,php,python,pretty much anything) to generate a translated png as well with minimal work
[02:04] <mhall119> imbrandon: will do, thanks
[02:06] <imbrandon> daker / mhall119: here is the current sources too for the button, should you need it for a Proof-of-Concept or similar etc etc
[02:07] <imbrandon> https://github.com/bholtsclaw/bholtsclaw.github.com/tree/master/assets/buttons
[02:42] <mhall119> my god these CES keynotes are cheesy
[02:44] <daker> https://plus.google.com/u/0/101694416703170881163/posts/PaG63ou1r6t
[02:46] <mhall119> daker: sounds like a new CES drinking game
[02:46] <imbrandon> i'm in :) hahaha
[02:46] <mhall119> maybe AlanBell can make CES Bingo cards
[02:48] <daker> omg steve balmer
[02:48] <imbrandon> what stream are you all watching ?
[02:49] <daker> http://ces.cnet.com/ces-videos/
[02:49] <imbrandon> ty
[02:49] <mhall119> oh gawd
[02:50] <mhall119> hide the chairs
[02:50] <imbrandon> i'm pretty sure Balmer will retire in 2013
[02:50] <imbrandon> or be forced to
[02:50]  * mhall119 wouldn't be surprised
[02:51] <imbrandon> 13 years at the helm, and with the tepid win8 and windows phone releases i think is sealing the deal on his retirement
[02:51] <mhall119> has it been 13 years already?
[02:52] <imbrandon> yup, well going on it, 2000
[02:52] <mhall119> they don't have a twitter app yet?
[02:52] <imbrandon> heh
[02:53] <mhall119> so Microsoft got their CES keynote afterall...
[02:53] <mhall119> I'm shocked
[02:53] <mhall119> shocked I say
[02:53] <daker> lightweight, smooth, highly secure, productive, isn't that cool :D
[02:54] <imbrandon> how cool is that
[02:54] <mhall119> isn't that cool
[02:54]  * mhall119 takes a shot
[02:55] <daker> and designed by the best designers in the world :D
[02:55] <mhall119> daker: solid colored squares are hard
[02:58] <daker> very hard!
[03:05] <daker> ironmans
[03:06] <imbrandon> 250ft tall ironmans
[03:06] <daker> :)
[03:07] <imbrandon> with a Indepdance day ripoff speech to pump them up for battle :)
[03:07] <mhall119> that movie looks terrible
[03:08] <daker> mhall119: the tricky thing is the rendering of the 3D scenes
[03:10] <imbrandon> i feel like I'm watching a torrent'd "cam"
[03:13] <mhall119> daker: technically yes, but without a decent story it's still a terrible movie
[03:14] <daker> mhall119: do you have any idea on how filmmakers uses ubuntu to render there movies (how to combine multiple servers to render one scene)
[03:16] <mhall119> daker: I've heard various 3d studios that work with film makers use Linux in general or Ubuntu in particular
[03:16] <mhall119> Jason DeRose could probably give you better info on that industry though
[03:18] <daker> mhall119: i just want to know what tech/software they use, i have a 3d animator friend and he always stuck at the rendring part(a full HD scene can take a day to render)
[03:19] <daker> scene = 2 to 5 sec
[03:21] <imbrandon> daker: Renderman, RenderRocket, Maya, Mental Ray ... and the software "hooks" the farm togather
[03:21] <imbrandon> not really the OS
[03:22] <imbrandon> like DreamWorks uses Ubuntu on HP Media Cloud alot
[03:23] <imbrandon> 10k cores 100% cpu 24/7 for 28 weeks to render 'How To Train Your Dragon'
[03:23] <imbrandon> so it takes a long time even for the big guys :)
[03:23] <daker> imbrandon: oh
[03:24] <daker> imbrandon: so my friend has done that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvSQUjJvjYo
[03:25] <imbrandon> nice
[03:25] <ajmitch> imbrandon: 10k sounds smallish, http://blog.dustinkirkland.com/2010/01/39000-core-ubuntu-cluster-renders.html
[03:26] <imbrandon> yea i thought so too cuz it was from memory but ... http://h20435.www2.hp.com/t5/The-Next-Bench-Blog/How-to-Train-Your-Dragon-Slays-Its-Way-To-Best-Animated-Feature/ba-p/61805
[03:27] <imbrandon> then again Avatar was MUCH higher quality too
[03:27] <imbrandon> and had custom render software written just for it :)
[03:27] <ajmitch> weta have been keeping busy with recent work like the hobbit, I think they're still using ubuntu there
[03:28] <imbrandon> yea, irrc they are
[03:28] <imbrandon> iirc*
[03:29]  * imbrandon is suprised ajmitch hasent been an extra on a LOTR movie :)
[03:29] <ajmitch> funny, but no :P
[03:36] <mhall119> daker: I worked on a render farm years ago
[03:36] <mhall119> I think they used renderman
[03:37] <mhall119> it was all Linux, some Redhat variant
[03:37] <daker> ok ty
[03:38] <mhall119> daker: my brother does this, I've been trying to get with him to see if we could use juju to build a render farm in the cloud
[03:38] <mhall119> right now he rents time on someone else's render farm, that's how most people do it I think
[04:07] <imbrandon> jcastro: why in the juju video ( most apparent at 2:17 ) does the juju logo and maas logo both use diffrent shades of Ubuntu orange ( and diffrent fonts / font weights ) on the screen at the same time no less
=== inetpro_ is now known as inetpro
[11:33] <daker> mhall119: nice
[13:40] <jcastro> imbrandon: not sure why
[16:30] <daker> does anyone know if u1 does have a qml sdk ?
[16:32] <czajkowski> aquarius: boo
[16:32] <czajkowski> daker: talk to aquarius
[16:33] <aquarius> hey, daker :)
[16:33] <daker> aquarius: does anyone know if u1 does have a qml sdk ?
[16:34] <aquarius> daker, depends which parts. U1DB, which is a syncable JSON database, will have -- we're working on it. In the interim we know roughly what that API will *look* like, and there's a prototype Python implementation you can use until the real one is done.
[16:34] <aquarius> daker, Ubuntu One file sync... you shouldn't need an API. Just save a file into a synced folder and you're done; U1 itself takes care of it for you.
[16:36] <daker> aquarius: my use case : a photo app with filter that will publish to u1 then get a public url which you can share to fb/tw
[16:37] <aquarius> daker, aah, right. The U1 file sync APIs to do things like publish a file are available over D-Bus, but aren't directly available from QML yet. However, they should be very easy to call from your application; the low-level app which starts up the QML view, is that in C? Python?
[16:39] <daker> aquarius: i haven't started yet those are just ideas that comes to my mind, anyway maybe i have to wait
[16:41] <daker> is this an official account https://twitter.com/ubuntuphone ?
[16:41] <aquarius> daker, it'd be pretty trivial to add to your app, fear not
[16:41] <daker> aquarius: ok thanks :)
[16:42] <aquarius> np
[17:00] <JoseeAntonioR> mhall119: around?
[17:03] <mhall119> JoseeAntonioR: yup
[17:03] <JoseeAntonioR> mhall119: was the wiki failing a couple moments ago? I was getting 500's everywhere
[17:04] <mhall119> I don't know, but it *is* the wiki
[17:06] <JoseeAntonioR> :P
[18:18] <JoseeAntonioR> mhall119: hey, do you think https://wiki.ubuntu.com/OnAir/BestPractices states things clearly?
[18:26] <popey> JoseeAntonioR: maybe something about microphone / headphones, and muting yourself when you're not talking, so no background noise comes in?
[18:26] <JoseeAntonioR> popey: great, will add that now
[18:27] <czajkowski> folks might be interested in reading
[18:28] <czajkowski> http://www.siriusopensource.com/content/qa-session-jane-silber-ceo-canonical
[19:59] <jcastro> imbrandon: 504 nginx errors on omg
[21:54] <bkerensa> jcastro: libfitbit does not seem to be syncing
[21:54] <bkerensa> :/
[21:56] <bkerensa> jcastro: looks like the PPA we have is outdated from upstream
[22:08] <popey> i should get a fitbit shouldn't i
[22:13] <mhall119> popey: it does seem to be what all the cool kids are doing
[22:14] <bkerensa> popey: you should
[22:14] <bkerensa> popey: and made libfitbit work so I don't have to boot VM :D
[22:14] <popey> i can probably just carry my phone i guess
[22:14] <bkerensa> popey: you have iphone?
[22:14] <bkerensa> eww
[22:14] <bkerensa> ;p
[22:14] <popey> of course
[22:15] <popey> i like beauty
[22:15] <popey> once Ubuntu Phone comes out, I'll switch to that (probbaly) ☺
[22:15] <bkerensa> now I know where these user studies come from
[22:15] <bkerensa> :D
[22:15] <czajkowski> they are nice
[22:15] <bkerensa> popey: yeah I hope to flash my gnex at the end of next month
[22:16] <czajkowski> latest firmwarm to my phone gives some nice swipe features, just not as smooth as the iphone
[22:16] <bkerensa> Main reason I ditched my iPhone is it got laggy for some reason
[22:17] <bkerensa> I get the new Firefox OS phone in a couple weeks so we will see how using that goes
[22:18] <czajkowski> bkerensa: availle to buy direct or where does one purchase it?
[22:19] <bkerensa> czajkowski: I am getting mine from Mozilla but they should be available in emerging markets I think in Q2.... So likely Asia and India first
[22:19] <popey> I heard brazil
[22:19] <czajkowski> mind boggling the way stuff is realeased, depending on locations
[22:20] <czajkowski> stuff should just be able to be bought never mind this daft country lark region
[22:20] <czajkowski> narks me off no end
[22:20] <popey> people probably wouldn't buy it here though
[22:20] <bkerensa> popey: likely brazil too... I don't think they have chosen all the emerging places they want to test it
[22:20] <popey> so no point marketing a device that wouldn't sell
[22:20] <czajkowski> popey: true, but at least the option should be there
[22:20] <bkerensa> But I know Latin America / India  / Asia is at the top of the list
[22:20] <czajkowski> it's like ubuntu laptops
[22:21] <mhall119> popey: they didn't give you a phone to play with?
[22:21] <czajkowski> you can buy from dell if you live in the states, but not if you were in .ie or .uk
[22:21] <popey> Nope
[22:21] <bkerensa> popey: Why would it not sell in UK?
[22:21] <mhall119> were the worried you'd forget it in a bar or something?
[22:21] <popey> hah
[22:21] <mhall119> :)
[22:21] <popey> i dont think the UK market needs a low end phone
[22:22] <czajkowski> you can go to tesco and get a 50 quid smart phone
[22:23] <popey> indeed
[22:23] <bkerensa> popey: It won't be low end and I think Mozilla has a unique advantage that there brand is already known to people across all OSes so people know what Firefox is and have a pre-existing relationship with the brand over say Android
[22:23] <popey> phones are dirt cheap here
[22:23] <bkerensa> 50 quid is how much USD?
[22:24] <popey> 80
[22:24] <bkerensa> oh wow
[22:24] <bkerensa> thats very cheap
[22:24] <popey> you can get smart phones for free here
[22:24] <czajkowski> bkerensa: phones are cheap
[22:24] <popey> our market is very different from US
[22:24] <czajkowski> and you can just change from carrier to carrier if you want
[22:24] <popey> see http://www.orange.co.uk/
[22:25] <popey> what you can get for nothing, just the 25 quid a month
[22:25] <bkerensa> Yeah I think the cheapest phone they sell prepaid at our grocery is $130
[22:25] <popey> and is that a smartphone?
[22:25] <popey> or a regular "featurephone"
[22:26] <bkerensa> popey: yeah very low end android
[22:26] <bkerensa> We don't sell feature phones much more in the U.S.
[22:26] <bkerensa> not in phone shops or grocery anymore
[22:26] <bkerensa> maybe online
[22:26] <popey> so i can see why they're looking at the emerging markets for firefox os
[22:26] <bkerensa> most carriers have been migrating people off of them
[22:27] <bkerensa> popey: I think its due to marketing.... Mozilla has more assets overseas than in the U.S. or UK
[22:31] <bkerensa> popey: is internet also cheap in the UK?
[22:32] <czajkowski> bkerensa: varies but yeah
[22:34] <popey> i guess
[22:34] <popey> some mobile networks throw in an ADSL router and home internet for free
[22:34] <popey> as does Sky (FOX)
[22:35] <popey> I have a bundle of cable TV, phone and 60Mb internet
[22:35] <bkerensa> nice
[22:36] <bkerensa> Yeah I pay about $50 for Cable Internet alone
[22:43]  * popey looks at fitbits on amz
[22:45] <s-fox> oh, hey everyone. didn't realise i'd joined this room.
[22:47] <s-fox> anyway, time to go. goodbye.
[22:48] <popey> heh
