[01:14] <bkerensa> philipballew: FB decided to lock my acct because I access via VPN (forgot to turnoff) well it decided to present your face data to authenticate

[16:30] <grantbow> weather didn't stop some cool people turning out last night for Ubuntu Hour SF.

[23:06] <grantbow> maybe it changed but I did an apt-get remove in an alpha image weeks ago and it wasn't there.

[23:06] <pleia2> seems to be back :) we can still do the custom builds as we always have and remove junk we don't want
[23:07] <grantbow> bkerensa patches are good! Kudos to Kees!
[23:07] <pleia2> Kees has been pretty outspoken about this all along
[23:08] <pleia2> been nice to see
[23:30] <bkerensa> grantbow: indeed but its said that they have not even reviewed it
[23:30] <bkerensa> and its not like they have not seen it
[23:30] <bkerensa> there is a patch pilot every week
[23:30] <bkerensa> my patches get reviewed in usually one week... not months later or not at all
