[12:13] <xnox> cjwatson: lp style LOC credit - http://paste.ubuntu.com/1516654/ =)) minor nitpick
[12:14] <cjwatson> xnox: I already uploaded, but go ahead
[12:14] <cjwatson> I'll include that in the precise version
[12:16] <cjwatson> xnox: Err, isn't it .set_visible though?
[12:16] <xnox> cjwatson: that's what I just found out. I guess, I should fix other instances as well.
[12:17] <cjwatson> xnox: No.  The only other two are on GtkEntry instances, where .set_visibility means something different.
[12:17] <cjwatson> (Visibility of the *contents* of the entry.)
[12:18] <xnox> **** vs pass.
[12:18] <xnox> ok.
[12:19] <xnox> repushed
[12:19] <cjwatson> ta
[12:20] <xnox> +10 lines on irc.
[12:20]  * xnox failed at LOC credit
[12:21] <cjwatson> heh
[12:23] <cjwatson> anything else you know of that needs to be rammed into ubiquity for 12.04.2?
[12:24] <cjwatson> I've got the wireless page fixes and the oem-config back button hiding
[12:30] <xnox> nothing that already has fixes committed.
[12:30] <xnox> does precise ubiquity use proposed or updates udebs?
[12:30] <xnox> there are a few partman-* that have not been verified yet.
[12:32] <cjwatson> -proposed.  Hopefully we'll get those verified then :)
[12:33] <xnox> quite.
[14:20] <xnox> hmm... usb creator please crash.
[14:26]  * ogra_ hands xnox a wooden hammer
[14:45]  * xnox ponders something.
[15:14] <plars> Hi, psivaa is seeing an odd issue when installing in german.  It seems to point to de.archive.ubuntu.com for pulling packages, even though the install is not happening from germany (just in german language).  Shouldn't the archive it picks be based on location of system rather than language?
[15:15] <cjwatson> It normally is.
[15:15] <plars> i.e. If I'm a native german speaker living in brazil and want to install it in my german language, I don't think I'd want it to picking to install packages from a mirror in germany
[15:16] <cjwatson> There are quirks though because only some locale combinations are defined.
[15:16] <cjwatson> But it is supposed to use the timezone you select.
[15:16] <cjwatson> If it's not doing so then it's a bug, although I'd want to see a debug log as there's considerable scope for user error here.
[15:17] <plars> ok good, this seemed wrong to me but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing some reason why the archive needed to match the language
[15:19] <cjwatson> (In fact, this is a reason why we must keep the timezone page even when the language in question only has a single locale option defined.)
[17:55] <psivaa> cjwatson: is there a way that we could preseed the installation in debug mode. i.e.
[17:55] <psivaa> without logging into the live session and running it in the commandline
[17:57] <cjwatson> psivaa: 'debug-ubiquity' as a boot parameter
[17:58] <psivaa> cjwatson: thanks v much. ill try that
