[13:05] <ish_> hi there ...
[13:06] <ish_> anybody who could give me info regarding registration of loco team?
[13:06] <czajkowski> ish_: hiya  what team ?
[13:07] <ish_> hello czajkowski. for the mauritian team.
[13:07] <ish_> http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-mu
[13:07] <czajkowski> what are you trying to find out specifically ?
[13:08] <ish_> i've went through the web pages and could not understand the loco team official registration process ?
[13:08] <ish_> can you please explain me?
[13:09] <czajkowski> so the team is here on LP https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-mu
[13:09] <czajkowski> is it you wan tto join it
[13:10] <czajkowski> or create one 
[13:10] <czajkowski> I'm  not clear on what you mean. 
[13:11] <ish_> that's the team i created ... a long time ago. 
[13:11] <czajkowski> right 
[13:11] <czajkowski> and it's imported into the ltp that you linked already 
[13:11] <ish_> then kris asked me to takeover ... but the team is still not officially registered with ubuntu.
[13:11] <czajkowski> it's a recognised loco 
[13:12] <ish_> if you check here, it's published as 'unapproved' > http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/
[13:12] <czajkowski> it's not an "approved loco" as in it's not gone through the approval process. 
[13:12] <czajkowski> is that what you would like to do ?
[13:13] <ish_> what's the difference between an 'approved' and 'recognized' loco ?
[13:13] <czajkowski> recognised is where you've been added to the teams  on LP so you appear on the LTP 
[13:13] <czajkowski> 'approved' means you've met the loco council 
[13:14] <czajkowski> showed us what you do 
[13:14] <czajkowski> shown you're a loco promoting ubuntu in some way shape or form 
[13:14] <czajkowski> and shown activity over a few months 
[13:14] <czajkowski> and you get a few extra gifts and area able to get a different type of conference pack 
[13:15] <ish_> ok ... i understand. then how should i get in contact with the loco council and show them our work and promotional campaigns ?
[13:16] <czajkowski> ish_: so a team creates an application and adds it to the wiki page https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/Agenda
[13:16] <czajkowski> usually teams add their events to the loco team portal
[13:16] <czajkowski> I dont see any events under that loco 
[13:16] <czajkowski> well sprry 
[13:16] <czajkowski> *sorry 
[13:16] <czajkowski> 2
[13:16] <czajkowski> http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-mu/events/history
[13:16] <ish_> not published anything recently ...
[13:17] <czajkowski> ish_: have a look at previous meetings to get an idea https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/Minutes
[13:19] <ish_> thanks for the links. i'll go through them.
[13:19] <czajkowski> np
[13:20] <czajkowski> ish_: we can also review your application if you want before a  meeting just email the loco council if you want to make sure you have enough content in it 
[13:21] <ish_> ok thanks. i will send an email to the lococouncil before applying.
[13:22] <ish_> thanks for the info czajkowski.
