[22:06] <tgm4883> Using pynotify for desktop notifications works great in python 2, is there a python 3 version of it as well?
[22:22] <tgm4883> As far as I can see, there isn't a python 3 version of python-notify
[22:24] <tgm4883> I guess it's getting replaced with python-notify2 and python3-notify2?
