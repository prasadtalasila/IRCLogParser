[07:29] <pitti> Laney: should we upload glib 2.35 to -proposed now? I'll ask the release team to block it from migration until at least all the autopkgtests succeed
[09:03] <Laney> pitti: Even given the segfault?
[09:03] <Laney> Do you need that version for some reason?
[09:04] <Laney> perhaps we could revert the commit in question
[09:04] <pitti> Laney: it blocks updating gobject-introspection and gvfs, both of which I got signed up for
[09:04] <pitti> and we agreed to update at least glib, d-conf, and the introspection stuff to GNOME 3.8
[09:04] <pitti> I'm a bit worried of intorducing glib 2.35.x too late
[09:05] <Laney> yeah, I agree with updating it
[09:05] <Laney> but I am very wary given that we know of this bug
[09:05] <pitti> Laney: reverting the bad commit sounds fine for me
[09:05] <pitti> yeah, true
[09:05] <Laney> ok, lets try reverting it
[09:05] <pitti> I made another commit to svn to drop the 92_revert_appinfo* patch
[09:06] <pitti> ah, but I forgot another build-dep, will commit now
[09:07] <pitti> ah no, desktop-file-utils is already there, nevermind
[09:08] <pitti> Laney: do you know the commit that needs reverting?
[09:09] <Laney> pitti: not yet, but https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690118#c7 is the clue
[09:09] <ubot2`> Gnome bug 690118 in general "Crash when closing last tab of a window using Ctrl-w" [Normal,New]
[09:10] <Laney> that's on 2012-10-09
[09:15] <pitti> Laney: oh, in comment 11?
[09:15] <pitti> Laney: I'll try a build with reverting this one and check
[09:16] <Laney> comment 7
[09:16] <Laney> ah, 11 shows it too
[09:16] <Laney> there are a couple more related commits
[09:16] <Laney> but maybe they can stay
[09:19] <pitti> hm, when I run gedit in jhbuild it doesn't even crash; trying again
[09:19] <Laney> .
[09:19] <pitti> ah, it does now; race condition
[09:19] <pitti> in jhbuild it's a lot faster to revert/try/etc; doing now
[09:23] <ricotz> pitti, Laney, hi, be aware of deadlocks with eglibc 2.16 which should be solved with 2.17
[09:23] <pitti> ricotz: with glib 2.35?
[09:23] <ricotz> pitti, yes
[09:23] <ricotz> due the GTask introduction
[09:24] <pitti> I didn't get a deadlock yet, but I've only run it since yesterday; do you have some details/bug for this?
[09:24] <ricotz> might be only hitting its actual consumers
[09:24] <ricotz> pitti, try to run some gstreamer apps
[09:24] <pitti> ah, maybe; we still by and large have GNOME 3.6
[09:24] <pitti> ricotz: oh, I'm getting tons of hangs with totem
[09:25] <ricotz> yes
[09:25] <pitti> but they happen with glib 2.34, too
[09:25] <pitti> ever since we moved to gst 1.0, I think
[09:25] <pitti> with RB as well
[09:25] <Laney> I get loads of hangs with pretty much any audio app on my 2.34 system
[09:25] <pitti> especially when trying to seek
[09:25] <ricotz> hmm, i see
[09:26] <ricotz> alright, bbl
[09:27] <pitti> Laney: reverting a36028f386708bb10d seems to do the trick; I tried 5 times in a row
[09:27]  * pitti commits that to SVN
[09:27] <Laney> great
[09:27] <Laney> feel free to upload to proposed then
[09:27] <Laney> I can take care of the block
[09:27] <pitti> great
[09:36] <pitti> Laney: uploaded

[09:47] <Laney> czajkowski: that's quite sad news :-/
[09:48] <Laney> did it affect you?
[09:48] <czajkowski> Laney: nope was gonna go to London today, but not after seeing that it will be crazy up there
[09:48] <pitti> mitya57: pushed
[09:48] <mitya57> thanks pitti!
[09:48] <pitti> thanks to you!

[11:25] <Laney> pitti: yay
[11:28] <Laney> hm, does anyone happen to know what the 'usb' seed is for?
[11:29] <pitti> Laney: yes
[11:29] <pitti> Laney: that was the successor of the "dvd" seed
[11:29] <Laney> do we build an image for it any more?
[11:29] <pitti> when we reduced it to an 1 GB (or so) image, while we didn't want to ditch DVDs yet
[11:30] <pitti> Laney: I don't think so, but perhaps triple-check with the cdimage host's crontab and cjwatson?
[11:30] <Laney> yeah
[11:30] <Laney> I was just wondering why pitivi was being kept in main and it seemed like that was the explanation
[11:30] <pitti> we now just have one image, "the" iso in daily-live/, right?
[11:30] <Laney> indeed
[11:30] <pitti> no alternate, no usb, no DVD

[13:11] <tjaalton> anyone objects removing gpointing-device-settings from raring? it seems abandoned upstream, orphaned in debian and doesn't build (needs porting to work with current g-s-d, I think)
[13:12] <Laney> is there any point keeping it in debian too, then?
[13:13] <tjaalton> probably not
[13:16] <tjaalton> looks like unapplying one patch made it build again, but whatever
[13:16] <Laney> if it's still useful for people we should keep it

[16:54] <Laney> oh, even armhf :-)
[16:54] <pitti> yeah, that's the one I was waiting for
[16:54] <pitti> now gobject-introspection needs to build on armhf
[16:54] <pitti> (it was depwaiting)
[16:54] <pitti> poppler, gdk-pixbuf etc. autopkgtests are happy again
[16:55] <pitti> the only remaining fallout is the deja-dup autopkgtest which stumbles over g_type_init
[16:55] <pitti> that's something for tomorrow, need to run now
[17:03] <mterry> pitti, is that what the deja-dup failure is?  I hadn't looked at it, but yeah the timing makes sense
[17:03] <cyphermox> brb, lunch
[17:06] <pitti> mterry: yes, indeed
[17:06] <mterry> hmm, that code is generated by valac.  I wonder if the latest valac skips that
[17:07] <mterry> Oh but this is autopkgtest, so it would be compiling fresh
[17:09] <mterry> The autopkgtest error log does not look intelligible.  I'm glad you know what "unable to remove uninstalled invalidation notifier" means, pitti.  :)
[17:09] <pitti> mterry: oh, is it that? I thought it was g_type_init
[17:09] <desrt> hey...
[17:09] <desrt> we're starting to get .la files in /usr/lib again
[17:09] <desrt> anyone know what's up with that?
[17:10] <pitti> mterry: so, that's fallout from the signal patch we reverted that causes crashes
[17:11] <pitti> mterry: gnome bug 690118
[17:11] <ubot2`> Gnome bug 690118 in general "Crash when closing last tab of a window using Ctrl-w" [Normal,New] http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690118
[17:11] <pitti> mterry: I reverted http://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/commit/?id=a36028f386708bb until that is fixed, as it's probably the lesser evil
[17:11] <pitti> really need to run now, good night!
[17:19] <desrt> seb128: this uimanager crash is the only thing stopping you from taking the new glib, hm?
[17:20] <seb128> desrt, hey, afaik yes
[17:20] <desrt> k.
[17:20] <seb128> Laney, ^ was there any other issue?
[17:20] <desrt> get a chance to go to jeffrey's yet, btw? :)
[17:20] <Laney> seb128: no, just that, but note that pitti uploaded it today reverting one commit
[17:21] <Laney> which might not be enough if you read the ^^^ conversation about deja-dup
[17:21] <seb128> desrt, not yet, still on my list
[17:21] <seb128> Laney, oh, cool ... will read the backlog on irclogs.u.c, I don't have a proxy to IRC and just started my client
[17:21] <Laney> ah, well it's just the jenkins autopkgtest failure
[17:22] <Laney> https://jenkins.qa.ubuntu.com/job/raring-adt-deja-dup/ARCH=amd64,label=adt/59/console
[17:22] <mterry> Yeah, I believe that's the warning it spits out that is causing the gtest to fail
[17:22] <mterry> Since IIRC, gtest fails when there is stderr output
[17:23] <desrt> mterry: s/stderr/g_message/
[17:23] <mterry> desrt, ah
[17:23] <mterry> for WARNING or CRITICAL I suppose
[17:24]  * mterry assumes this is not something to be worked around on the deja-dup side, so will let ya'll figure out the best glib-side fix
[17:25] <desrt> mterry: and error, of course
[17:25] <desrt> what's the issue?
[17:26] <desrt> g_type_init() should not be issuing any g_warning() output
[17:26] <mterry> desrt, it is the the "unable to remove uninstalled invalidation notifier" message failing the deja-dup test suite
[17:27] <mterry> desrt, in autopkgtest, which is holding up (rightly) the glib landing
[17:27] <desrt> that's something different, i think
[17:27] <mterry> desrt, that's something to do with https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=690118 eh?
[17:27] <ubot2`> Gnome bug 690118 in general "Crash when closing last tab of a window using Ctrl-w" [Normal,New]
[17:27] <desrt> sort of yes
[17:27] <desrt> the actual bug is much older.  10+ years
[17:27] <desrt> it has a 5 digit number.  let me dig it out
[17:28] <desrt> ah.  6 digit number, but starts with 1... :)  https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=118536
[17:28] <ubot2`> Gnome bug 118536 in gobject "Make g_signal_connect_object'ed handlers disconnect when the data object is destroyed" [Major,Resolved: fixed]
[17:28] <mterry> desrt, is deja-dup misusing glib in a way that is just now being exposed, or is this a glib-side bug that is just now being exposed as a warning?
[17:29] <desrt> mterry: i'm trying to determine that today
[17:29] <mterry> desrt, ah OK  :)
[17:29] <Laney> let me find the commit that pitti reverted earlier
[17:30] <Laney> http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/pkg-gnome/desktop/experimental/glib2.0/debian/patches/08_revert_closure_invalidation.patch?view=markup
[17:36] <desrt> pitti: so gedit does this: $PYTHON -c "import gi; print(gi._overridesdir)"
[17:36] <desrt> to decide where to install some files
[17:37] <desrt> this ends up pointing into /usr even if --prefix is given
[17:37] <desrt> i assume that there is some environment variable that could be used to specify additional override directories.... is there a way to get the full list and/or pick the last one instead of the first?
[17:59] <robert_ancell> RAOF, any opposition to shipping the latest colord in raring?
