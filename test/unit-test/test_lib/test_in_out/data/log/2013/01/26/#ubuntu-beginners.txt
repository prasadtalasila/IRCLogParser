[00:10] <r4y> I am running Ubuntu 10.04 and am downloading Ubuntu 12.04 to put onto CD, what program do I use to burn it into CD?, I have always used Nero on Windows XP and I would like to not use Nero, lol.
[00:10] <r4y> Is a prgogram already installed for this?
[00:12] <r4y> I mean do I need to install ISO Master?, or is there a program already installed in Ubuntu 10.04 for this?
[00:14] <geirha> Ubuntu has been able to burn isos for as long as I can remember
[00:14] <geirha> you right-click the iso and choose "Burn to disc..." or something like that
[00:15] <r4y> Ah OK, I will see when the time comes.
[00:15] <r4y> Sounds like something I've seen before
[00:16] <r4y> Great, TY
[00:16] <r4y> Take care, bye
[00:17] <r4y> write to disc, but I have to halt my computer, then rehook up my CD writer
[00:17] <r4y> bye
[01:21] <IveBeenBit> I have a problem setting up dual boot on a machine that already has Windows on it. The first stage where it asks me to choose a place for boot loader installation, it only will show the live USB drive. It seems I cannot get to the hard disk that holds Windows
[01:21] <escott> IveBeenBit, what version of windows?
[01:22] <IveBeenBit> Windows 7
[01:23] <escott> IveBeenBit, can you select "try ubuntu" with the live USB and run "sudo parted -l " and paste that to paste.ubuntu.com
[01:23] <IveBeenBit> 1 moment please. Thank you.
[01:28] <IveBeenBit> Sorry it took so long. I have a Dvorak keyboard and have to type in Qwerty without seeing the letters. HAHA. URL upcoming
[01:29] <IveBeenBit> paste.ubuntu.com/1571450
[01:29] <escott> IveBeenBit, why do you have partitions on your flash disk?
[01:30] <IveBeenBit> I don't know. I used unetbootin and installed an ISO on the flash disk. My guess is that unetbootin did it.
[01:31] <IveBeenBit> Or maybe I did months ago when I was messing with it. It could be my fault.
[01:31] <escott> IveBeenBit, ok never used unetbootin... it also did it in the stupidest way imaginable
[01:31] <escott> IveBeenBit, so when you go into the installer you dont see windows at all?
[01:32] <IveBeenBit> hang on I will go back to the installer so I can tell you accurately
[01:32] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: i ran into that and realized mt usb was not formatted FAT32
[01:32] <duanedesign> but ntfs
[01:33] <IveBeenBit> at the installer it has /dev/stb and under that .../stb1 and ...sdb5
[01:34] <IveBeenBit> an the bottom is the drop down and I can choose dev sda, sdb or sdb1
[01:34] <escott> IveBeenBit, then it is seeing sda
[01:35] <escott> IveBeenBit, but it doesnt list windows? perhaps it is booting efi. can you see if there is a folder /sys/firmware/efi or /sys/firmware/uefi
[01:35] <IveBeenBit> Right, but when I pick that, it does not change the selections at the top...still shows the graph of the USB's partitions
[01:36] <IveBeenBit> in sys/firmware there is only acpi and memmap
[01:36] <escott> IveBeenBit, i dont remember all the steps in the installer is this after you selected "manual partitioning" or before?
[01:37] <IveBeenBit> before. I am trying to get to the part that lets me partition
[01:37] <IveBeenBit> It's the very 1st step after it tells you to make sure you have enough hard drive space.
[01:37] <duanedesign> is it trying to onstall the bootloadder while creating the usb?
[01:37] <ubuntuuser> back again, my mouse still not working I already discarded a hardware issue (it works on bios), so not sure what to do from here.
[01:37] <escott> IveBeenBit, well the bootloader will be installed to the mbr so your original question about the bootloader is irrelevant to whether or not it shows windows partitions on that disk
[01:38] <ubuntuuser> I am using a 12.04lets version desktop
[01:38] <IveBeenBit> escott: so I should just tell it to install the bootloader at sda?
[01:39] <escott> IveBeenBit, i thought the bootloader was after the partitioning... so im a bit confused as to what step you are at
[01:39] <IveBeenBit> you want to remote desktop into this thing? I just formatted everything so there's nothing personal on it
[01:40] <escott> IveBeenBit, the bootloader would be installed to sda if you plan to install the system to sda.
[01:40] <IveBeenBit> but it's seriously the first screen after it says "make sure you have 5 gigs and are connected to the internet"
[01:40] <escott> IveBeenBit, i could be wrong about the order in which it asks you things
[01:40] <IveBeenBit> I was planning to give Ubuntu its own partitions, and put the bootloader in there
[01:41] <escott> IveBeenBit, pbr loaders are very fragile
[01:41] <IveBeenBit> But understand I am a linux dumbass and may be trying to do something stupid without realizing it
[01:41] <escott> IveBeenBit, grub really doesnt like doing that you would probably have to do it all manually
[01:41] <duanedesign> I had a hard time with the usb-creator yesterday. i also did not have any DVDs. I ended up installing 11.04 on CD and upgrading onr distro at a time until I got to 12.10\\
[01:42] <escott> IveBeenBit, there is a difference between the "bootloader" and the second stage grub files and the boot files
[01:42] <IveBeenBit> Grub has given me big problems before. It broke Windows last time I tried to ise Ubuntu
[01:43] <IveBeenBit> Back then I had motherboard RAID installed but I reconfigured everything because Ubuntu doesn't like BIOS-driven RAID apparently
[01:43] <IveBeenBit> but it put grubs everywhere
[01:43] <escott> IveBeenBit, they call it fake raid for a reason
[01:43] <IveBeenBit> so I was hoping to keep it segregated this time
[01:44] <escott> IveBeenBit, the reason fakeraid support is bad is because its complete junk and most developers recognize that and don't have any interest in writing drivers for it
[01:44] <IveBeenBit> So I got rid of all the fake RAID arrays. The problem is I have one of these fancy motherboards that uses an SSD as a windows cache disk. So I have to tie the HDD and SDD together into a fakeraid
[01:45] <escott> IveBeenBit, and thats not going to work.
[01:45] <IveBeenBit> SSD*
[01:45] <IveBeenBit> I was afraid you would say that
[01:46] <escott> IveBeenBit, i would go buy yourself another disk and don't put it into any intel storage anything and use it properly
[01:46] <IveBeenBit> Right now I only have 1 HDD plugged in and no RAID activated. I was going to partition everything and install both OSes and then turn on the RAID and see if it breaks Ubuntu
[01:46] <escott> IveBeenBit, you can google around and see if anyone has had success with that intel speed whatever, but i doubt it
[01:46] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: their are some windows programs the mess with the MBR (eho knows why). For example Adobe Creative Suite
[01:46] <escott> IveBeenBit, it will
[01:48] <IveBeenBit> Do you think I could put Windows on an entire separate HDD, tie that into the SSD with Fake RAID and give Ubuntu it's own HDD that is not in a RAID array at all?
[01:48] <escott> IveBeenBit, supposedly its supported with dmraid 1.0.0-rc15 so you could try, but i would not
[01:48] <escott> IveBeenBit, that is what i would
[01:49] <IveBeenBit> escott: what do you mean? "That is what I would"
[01:50] <escott> IveBeenBit, have a disk outside the rapid storage array and use that to boot linux
[01:51] <IveBeenBit> OK. Well then I will have to put an old HDD into this badboy and start from scratch. I'll probably be back to bug you guys then.
[01:51] <escott> IveBeenBit, the other thing that people sometimes do is put their bootloader and /boot directory on a thumb drive and then use whatever fakeraid stuff on their disks
[01:51] <escott> IveBeenBit, that circumvents the "grub doesn't know what intel is doing" problem and puts it all on the shoulders of dmraid which has a better chance of working. i still would not trust intel rapid storage with my data though
[01:53] <IveBeenBit> I don't trust Intel RST with my data. All the data goes on a separate HDD but RST has been working well for me for a year.
[01:53] <IveBeenBit> Do you guys have an opinion on this: http://bcache.evilpiepirate.org/
[01:53] <IveBeenBit> Or this: https://github.com/facebook/flashcache
[01:55] <IveBeenBit> BTW thank you very much for your time, guys.
[01:55] <escott> IveBeenBit, if you have it in writeback mode then you are trusting it with your data
[01:57] <escott> IveBeenBit, i would certainly trust an in kernel software implementation more. neither are in the ubuntu kernels at this time. bcache may make it into mainline at some point
[01:57] <IveBeenBit> escott: so I should just watch the update notes and see if bcache is ever included? Then maybe switch?
[01:58] <escott> IveBeenBit, well you can't "switch"
[01:59] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: http://linux.slashdot.org/story/10/08/28/2112208/some-windows-apps-make-grub-2-unbootable
[01:59] <duanedesign> i am sure they are not doinr it on purpose ;)
[02:02] <IveBeenBit> OK Well then I will start over. So the plan is: 1) Put Windows on its own HDD & fakeraid it to the SSD 2) Put Ubuntu on its own disk - no RAID. Anything else I should know?
[02:05] <duanedesign> if you have any questions fek free to ask them here. You may not get an immediattte response but we do check thr channel regularly
[02:06] <IveBeenBit> Thank you guys for the help! Let's see how this goes!
[02:07] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: You can also ping our team members in #ubuntu-beginners-team . That is where we chit chat and take care of team business
[02:07] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: best of luck!
[02:07] <IveBeenBit> what is the proper etiquette to do that so I'm not being intrusive?
[02:08] <duanedesign> just ask if dsomeone can herlp with issue X in #ubuntu-beginners
[02:09] <IveBeenBit> Good deal. Thank again. I'm Audi!
[02:09] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: you can also join the the Neginners Team we are always looking for new members :)
[02:10] <duanedesign> currently the ter=am is open. The only prerequisite is that you want to help the community domehow
[02:10] <IveBeenBit> I will do it if I can ever get this marvelous OS to work on my computer!
[02:11] <duanedesign> hopefully se can help you do that
[02:11] <duanedesign> IveBeenBit: i will send you a PM w/ my email
[02:12] <IveBeenBit> OK nice. PM received

[20:24] <ryan1975> Good day. I am looking for help understanding a piece of hardware on my Ubuntu desktop.
[20:24] <ryan1975> Am I in the right place?
[20:26] <ryan1975> I have a Planar touchscreen. The touch pointing device was working for a while, but it has stopped working.
[20:32] <ryan1975> how do I test it for a hardware issue?
[20:38] <holstein> could be complicated
[20:38] <holstein> you'd have to go to a supported operating system and driver
[20:41] <ryan1975> Someone else seems to have gotten the hardware working here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2082116&highlight=Planar+touchscreen
[20:42] <holstein> well, you had the hardware working, correct?
[20:42] <ryan1975> I had too, but now it is not working, and I do not know enough to troubleshoot HW vs. software.
[20:42] <holstein> i dont think its an issue of "can it work"
[20:42] <holstein> to troubleshoot the hardware, id want to have another one, and just swap it out
[20:42] <ryan1975> No. It is not an issue of can it work. I am trying to use "how it works" to determine why it stopped working.
[20:42] <holstein> have one working, and swap in the questionable one
[20:43] <holstein> OR, you'll need to go to what is supported
[20:43] <holstein> ryan1975: i disagree
[20:43] <holstein> ryan1975: if it was working, then it *can* work
[20:43] <holstein> its not working now, and you dont know why, and you are (and rightly so) trying to determine if its bad hardware
[20:44] <ryan1975> Yes. I agree that it can work. I wonder if I did something to the software to make it stop working.
[20:44] <holstein> the answer is not one you want to hear though, since it likely envolves installing a supported operating system
[20:44] <ryan1975> For example, I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10.
[20:44] <holstein> one the manufacturer supportes
[20:44] <holstein> ryan1975: try a  12.04 live CD
[20:44] <ryan1975> Hmm...I could try that.
[20:44] <holstein> if it worked in 12.04, it'll work with the 12.04 live CD, and you can decide what to do about it from there
[20:46] <ryan1975> Fair enough. If it does not work with the live CD. Test it on a Win7 laptop.
[20:46] <ryan1975> ?
[20:47] <holstein> ryan1975: if it doesnt work, i dont feel like you can assume the hardware is broken
[20:47] <ryan1975> The hardware is designed for Win7 according to the manufacturer.
[20:47] <ryan1975> Agreed.
[20:48] <ryan1975> Do you have a different recommendation if it does not work from a 12.04 Live CD?
[20:49] <ryan1975> I'm trying to come up with a list of things to try rather than a single task Do loop.
[20:49] <holstein> ryan1975: it'll be literally whatever you feel comfortable with based on what the manufacturer expects
[20:50] <holstein> what would i want? 2 devices.. one working.. swap in the broken one.. on whatever operating system
[20:50] <ryan1975> I understand.
[20:51] <ryan1975> Do you have a suggestion for tracking down potential software solutions?
[20:51] <ryan1975> The device shows up in lsusb as "Quanta Optical Touch Screen" under 12.10.
[20:51] <ryan1975> It did the same in 12.04 when it worked.
[20:53] <holstein> i usually try live CD's til something works, then i'll just search around.. searching "ubuntu" and "linux".. searching broad as possible
[20:54] <ryan1975> Thank you for your help. I'll go see what I can find.
[23:18] <IveBeenBit> I am having problems installing Ubuntu in a dual boot with Windows 7. The partition editor does not recognize any of my hard drives, and then the installer crashes.
