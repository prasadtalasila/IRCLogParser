[15:38] <Myrtti> awww
[15:41] <lhavelund> :)
[15:56] <Tm_T> wwwwaaaa
[16:00] <Tm_T> lhavelund: want to have an advice from old and (not so) wise?
[16:04] <Tm_T> I give it anyway, never forget and always remember to, to, what was that, well, what that thing does here?! ->
[16:06] <Tm_T> ah, yes, I need coffee after having eaten
[16:08] <Tm_T> hi lorddelta
[16:09] <lorddelta> Greetings, I'm here to inquire as to the sentence/severity of my ban. It seems I received an auto-ban from #ubuntu-offtopic the other day for some mild language. Could anyone help me?
[16:09] <Tm_T> lorddelta: as far as I know it was not any kind of autoban (and bans are not punishment) (:
[16:10] <Tm_T> lorddelta: do you know why you were banned?
[16:10] <lorddelta> Tm_T: I have an idea but I'll not repeat the word here I suppose.
[16:11] <Tm_T> lorddelta: were you requested to not use that word multiple times?
[16:11] <lorddelta> Tm_T: I don't recall being asked to stop; if I did it was during that conversation.
[16:11] <lorddelta> it was not*
[16:13] <Tm_T> lorddelta: ikonia might have not been clear enough but you did respond to him about it
[16:14] <lorddelta> I did message him this morning, I really shouldn't have been up (it was 5 in the morning), and I needed to get sleep.
[16:14] <lorddelta> Oh, I didn't get a message from ikonia?
[16:14] <Tm_T> lorddelta: in the channel, within the conversation, you did (:
[16:15] <Tm_T> and you did respond
[16:15] <lorddelta> Tm_T: I could I perhaps see the logs? I'm not sure if my software supports that at this time.
[16:16] <Tm_T> lorddelta: it's not publicly logged channel, so one moment...
[16:19] <Tm_T> lorddelta: the key point is for me that if you agree to play nice, I have no objections on letting you in (:
[16:19] <Tm_T> lorddelta: you can do that?
[16:20] <lorddelta> Tm_T: I am sorry, I believe I can when my head is on straight. Fewer late hours, and I've added a filter in the software to help avert issues in future.
[16:21] <Tm_T> it's allright
[16:21] <lorddelta> Is balderdash ok?
[16:21] <lorddelta> As an acceptable word.
[16:23] <Tm_T> I don't see a point for using such words in the first place
[16:23] <Tm_T> but I believe the idea is to respect others, I don't think there can be a list of words that are ok and what are not
[16:24] <lorddelta> I understand, would self-censoring be better then? i.e. replace with ***
[16:25] <lorddelta> I don't mean as a license for saying whatever I want to
[16:25] <Tm_T> you shouldn't have need for such things in the first place (:
[16:25] <Tm_T> lorddelta: your ban is lifted now, you may try joining the channel
[16:25] <lorddelta> The decisions I made last night were poor, but the mistake would have been less if I had the filter setup I'd imagine.
[16:26] <lorddelta> Tm_T: thanks.
[21:08] <lhavelund> Tm_T: By all means!
[21:08] <lhavelund> Advice is good
