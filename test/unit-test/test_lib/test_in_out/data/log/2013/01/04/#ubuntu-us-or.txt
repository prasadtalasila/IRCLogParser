[02:01] <nathwill> slangasek, any problems with ubiquity i should be aware of before trying to install a 13.04 nightly?
[02:01] <nathwill> also, FDE is working now, eh?
[02:27] <slangasek> FDE?
[02:27] <nathwill> full disk encryption
[02:27] <nathwill> feel free to verner von braun this
[02:27] <slangasek> ah; for a cycle now, yes
[02:27] <slangasek> as for ubiquity issues, I'm aware of none
[02:28] <nathwill> k. gonna do a clean install on this mac tonite, feeling like living on the edge
[02:28] <nathwill> thanks :)
[02:28] <nathwill> i'm willing to take the chance on edge cases, but figured you'd know of any major showstoppers
[02:30] <bkerensa> slangasek: I assume FDE only works when the entire HDD is encrypted as in no other partitions can be unecrypted
[02:32] <slangasek> that seems tautological. ;)
[02:33] <nathwill> i don't remember seeing the option during my last 12.10 install, but i remember the EFF lauding praise on y'all for getting it shipped
[02:33] <slangasek> I believe the support exposed in the installer UI only allows you to do full-disk encryption, no per-partition encryption
[02:33] <cweber10> ubuntu requires a none encrypted /boot
[02:34] <slangasek> right, excepting /boot
[02:36] <bkerensa> slangasek: ahh I see... I have this one parition that has this one non-free thing on it and I probably need to bug my fiancee to not need it anymore and move to FDE.
[02:36] <bkerensa> slangasek: while at the same time I do not understand what benefits FDE provides over the existing encryption of /home
[02:37] <nathwill> bkerensa: imagine that your shipping a corporate customized ubuntu image with some proprietary apps installed in /usr/bin
[02:37] <nathwill> or any number of other scenarios where sensitive info may be distributed throughout the filesystem
[02:37] <nathwill> *you're
[02:38] <cweber10> fde prevents reading of any folder like /tmp /var /etc and any posible injection of programs into the bin directories
[02:38] <bkerensa> nathwill: yeah I guess for integrity of those paths it would be nice
[02:38] <bkerensa> and those purposes
[02:39] <nathwill> if it's available, i don't know why anyone would pass it up, there's no noticeable performance hit for it
[02:41] <bkerensa> wat
[02:41] <nathwill> indeed sir
[02:42] <bkerensa> some guy on G+ asking when he can install Ubuntu without Windows or DOS
[02:42] <bkerensa> https://plus.google.com/u/0/113424166596580975111/posts/Lf9tMXb1Snf
[02:42] <bkerensa> x.x
[02:42] <nathwill> you're being trolled amigo
[02:42] <nathwill> see that malicious smirk?
[02:43] <bkerensa> heh
[02:43] <bkerensa> idk man
[02:43] <bkerensa> he could live in some cave... it happens
[02:43] <bkerensa> My trolldar did not go off
[02:44] <cweber10> I find the mention of dos a bit odd.
[02:45] <nathwill> alrighty then... back in a bit, going to blow up this laptop for giggles
[02:45] <bkerensa> idk in Ghana we California LoCo had someone replacing windows with edubuntu
[02:45] <bkerensa> they had installed windows because they did not know how to use linux apps at all
[02:45] <bkerensa> so
[02:45] <bkerensa> I imagine its possible
[05:22] <slangasek> bkerensa: full-disk encryption only encrypts your Ubuntu partitions, not your Windows ones.
[05:24] <slangasek> you just don't get to configure whether it encrypts your *full* Ubuntu install or not
[06:45] <bkerensa> slangasek: luckily I have no data on Windows partition :) since I never login there
[07:56] <bkerensa> :D
[07:56] <bkerensa> kees man you hack on too much software
[07:56] <bkerensa> :P
[07:56]  * bkerensa found you in authors file again
[07:58] <bkerensa> kees: Do you by chance know if libdvdread still has a upstream repo and accepts patches?
[15:29] <kees> bkerensa: I think it's kind of dead. I haven't looked recently. VLC might be keeping it currently.
[15:31] <kees> hrm, not dead. the snapshot was from october
[15:31] <kees> http://github.com/microe/libdvdread
[15:37] <kees> (that's the debian split, since it seems that http://dvdnav.mplayerhq.hu/ hasn't been touched in over a year
[23:14] <nathwill> so i got to have a party with EFI last night :/
[23:14] <nathwill> which basically comes down to "macs are stupid"
[23:30] <bkerensa> nathwill: :D
[23:31] <nathwill> srsly.
[23:31] <nathwill> though it ended well. i no longer have to hold the option key to boot the machine :)
[23:59] <bkerensa> heh
