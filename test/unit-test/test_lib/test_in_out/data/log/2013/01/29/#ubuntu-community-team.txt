[00:52] <mhall119> AlanBell: I love that the guy on G+ was trying to name-drop on you by saying he's spoken to Canonical employees
[00:54] <daker> mhall119: talking about me ?
[00:56]  * snap-l catches Canonical Employees and forces them to tell me where the pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow.
[01:02] <mhall119> daker: no, another thread
[01:02] <daker> ah ok
[01:03] <mhall119> snap-l: the pot of gold is in the bzr, of course
[01:12] <snap-l> mhall119: No wonder nobody can find it. ;)
[01:12] <mhall119> ouch :(
[01:26] <AlanBell> mhall119: yeah, it annoys me that people are critical whilst unneccessarily wrong :)
[01:36] <mhall119> AlanBell: I'm just amused that talking to a Canonical employee is somehow a significant accomplishment
[01:50] <snap-l> If you talk to 5, you unlock a badge.
[01:56] <mhall119> sweet, I only have 2 more to go!
[02:01] <IdleOne> mhall119: you can't count yourself
[02:01] <IdleOne> :P
[02:19] <imbrandon> bkerensa: "but look at the full report even +Brandon Holtsclaw made the list." , Gee thanks! /sarcasim :) lol j/k

[16:46] <bkerensa> :)
[16:47] <jono> bkerensa, you mean Spirit Of 77?
[16:47] <jono> I think we will just do the Fri night thing at the double-tree

[16:47] <bkerensa> oh ok
[16:47] <bkerensa> jono: nah spirit is there still

[16:48] <bkerensa> but the double tree is nice too :) they have a fireplace and good cider
