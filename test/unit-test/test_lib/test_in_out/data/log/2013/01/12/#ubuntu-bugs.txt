[13:26]  * penguin42 is so tempted to respond positively on one of the bugs where someone has sent it a linkedin invitation
[14:17] <Rcart> hello, I want to nominate bug 949077 as SRU. I'm working in triaging it as a SRU, but I cannot fill the [Regresion potential] field cause I don't know if there'd be any regresion
[14:17] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 949077 in notify-osd (Ubuntu) "Black border on notifications when running with no compositing" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/949077
[14:18] <Rcart> how can I fill it?
[14:22] <penguin42> Well the challenge is would it break anything other than notify-osd?   And could it break notify-osd for others?
[14:31] <Rcart> penguin42: to answer those questions I should be very familiar with the package's code and functionality, or how should I start looking for the regresion potential?
[14:33] <penguin42> Rcart: It's not easy unless you are familiar with the code; you could try asking the maintainer
[14:37] <Rcart> ok, thanks. I'll ask in -devel cause there's no maintainer in LP package's page
[14:42] <penguin42> Rcart: If you look in packages.ubuntu.com and in the package source you should find the email address of the maintainer of a package
[14:42]  * penguin42 disappears for a while
[14:44] <Rcart> penguin42: you're right, apt-cache would do it also
[17:03] <Squarism> Where do i report bugs on unity whackness?
[17:04] <Squarism> REading the WALL of text at the topic mention wiki entry didnt help
[17:19] <penguin42> Squarism: Easiest way is just to run   ubuntu-bug unity
[17:20] <penguin42> Squarism: If it's a dislike of a feature then you may have to try a mailing list; but if it's a dislike of  a feature please go slowly and gently explain your reasons
