[04:30] <Glitchd> can anyone give me a clue as to how i would go about writing a scritp to launch a program that is in /usr/bin ?
[04:31] <dniMretsaM> Glitchd: using what, bash?
[04:31] <Glitchd> dniMretsaM, ummm....idk
[04:32] <Glitchd> dniMretsaM, its an "sh" script if that helps toward your question
[04:32] <Glitchd> dniMretsaM, its to launch a program called "x11vnc"
[04:32] <dniMretsaM> that would be using bash, most likely. you can simply put a call to that file in your script
[04:32] <Glitchd> dniMretsaM, this is what i have so far
[04:33] <Glitchd> #!/bin/bash
[04:33] <Glitchd> /usr/bin/x11vnc.sh
[04:33] <dniMretsaM> and that doesn't work?
[04:33] <Glitchd> nope
[04:33] <Glitchd> says its not there
[04:33] <jazzkutya> drop the .sh unless if it really is /usr/bin/x11vnc.sh
[04:33] <jazzkutya> -if
[04:33] <dniMretsaM> yeah, what he said
[04:35] <Glitchd> jazzkutya, in the bin folder, its just an icon with "x11vnc" no ending or anything.
[04:35] <Glitchd> jazzkutya, i thought i was an sh file
[04:36] <Glitchd> thats hilarious. it worked.
[04:36] <Glitchd> now i need to add that script to startup at boot
[04:37] <Glitchd> i have it on my server and i would be convenient if it would just start then i dont have to log in with ssh and start it then log in with vnc
[04:37] <Glitchd> i could just log in with vnc
[04:37] <Glitchd> cuts a few step out of the equation
[04:37] <Glitchd> how would i add that script to start with the machine
[04:37] <Glitchd> =?
[04:38] <Glitchd> **?
[04:39] <jazzkutya> does that x11vnc start it's own session like the vncserver i use?
[04:39] <jazzkutya> or it uses the session it was started from?
[04:40] <Glitchd> jazzkutya, dont quite understand what u mean..
=== curt is now known as Guest39473
[04:41] <jazzkutya> well then you better not administer any server on the internet :)
[04:41] <Glitchd> wait i understand after reading it again..
[04:42] <Glitchd> it starts its own session
[04:42] <jazzkutya> does it change to an unprivileged user if started as root?
[04:42] <Glitchd> ...nope wrong. it uses the current session
[04:42] <jazzkutya> i'm not on linux right now to check this
[04:43] <jazzkutya> well then it's complicated
[04:43] <Glitchd> i made an .sh script to start it, i just need to know how to add the .sh script to session and startup, and if that will even work.
[04:43] <jazzkutya> somehow you can setup autologin with ubuntu i guess... i was able to do this with 8.04 i don't know how it works with current ubuntu
[04:44] <Glitchd> i dont need it to autologin..
[04:45] <Glitchd> ok screw that question, answer this.
[04:45] <jazzkutya> you have to autostart your script from kde _and_ setup autologin so the the system will automatically start a kde session to which you can connect to with kde
[04:46] <Glitchd> im adding it to session and startup, for the command i put /home/***/x11vnc.sh
[04:46] <jazzkutya> but afaik ubuntu has a vnc server builtin that can be set up with simple gui
[04:46] <Glitchd> or do i have to put /home/***/./x11vnc.sh
[04:46] <Glitchd> ?
[04:49] <jazzkutya> they are the same
[04:49] <Glitchd> oh..
[04:50] <Glitchd> thought it was imparative to put the "./" to make sh scripts launch..
[04:50] <jazzkutya> in commandline yes but not in an absolute path
[04:50] <jazzkutya> an absolute path is one that starts with /
[04:51] <Glitchd> mmk, good to know.

[14:33] <FlowRiser> Hey all, i'm using Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with unity+compiz; I want to switch to kde as easy as possible; What's the best course of action ?
[14:44] <Peace-> FlowRiser: just install kubuntu-desktop package
[14:44] <Peace-> FlowRiser: and remove unity
[14:44] <Peace-> !purekde
[14:44] <ubottu> If you want to remove all !Gnome packages and have a default !Kubuntu system follow the instructions here « http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde »
[14:44] <BluesKaj> FlowRiser, install kubuntu-desktop , then you cah remove ubuntu-desktop if you wish
[14:45] <FlowRiser> Peace-, BluesKaj, thanks will do :)
[14:45] <Peace-> BluesKaj: for you information removing ubuntu-desktop doesn't remove all the packages :P
[14:45] <BluesKaj> yes , he has to purge them
[14:45] <Peace-> BluesKaj: mmm ubuntu-desktop is a metapackage
=== spawn[dead] is now known as spawn57
[14:47] <BluesKaj> yeah , but the page you poated for pure kde used to be behind anbd didn't include 12.10 until recently , hence my suggestions, Peace-
[14:47] <Peace-> BluesKaj: have you tried with purge?
[14:47] <BluesKaj> that page takes ages to update , I'm surprised
[14:47] <Peace-> for what i remember it doesn't do the job
[14:48] <BluesKaj> yes it woks ok but it's more work
[14:48] <Peace-> ah
[14:48] <Peace-> BluesKaj: never installed unity :P
[14:49] <BluesKaj> I did , but switched to gnome shell very quickly , then after a week i got rid of it as well
[14:50] <Peace-> BluesKaj: :P echo  $(apt-cache show ubuntu-desktop | awk '/Depen/ || /Rec/{ gsub(/\,/,"") ;gsub(/Recommends:/,"");gsub(/Depends:/,""); print} ' | awk '{ printf "%s", $0 }')
[14:50] <Peace-> prints all the ubuntu dependences :D
[14:51] <Peace-> BluesKaj: i used this method to reinstall kde :D http://nowardev.wordpress.com/2010/11/08/reinstall-kde/
[14:52] <BluesKaj> well after removing gnome i just purged all the ubuntu apps except for synaptic and then used autremove and autoclean after a reboot ...seems to have done the job ..I'm still running the same install

[15:07] <Das_Auge> Hello, is there a certain way to tell KDM at which reslution to start?
[15:11] <FlowRiser> Ok, so i'm downloading the kubuntu-desktop package
[15:11] <FlowRiser> can i just disable unity, rather than uninstalling it ?
[15:13] <BluesKaj> FlowRiser, you can choose which desktop to run at the login page
[15:13] <bazhang> sure
[15:13] <bazhang> choose kde4, or whatever others you have installed , such as gnome-shell, gnome-panel, xfce4 etc
[15:14] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, that might be a problem ... thanks for reminding me to change the login screen to unity-greeter; I'm running a custom greeter
[15:14] <FlowRiser> Haven't gotten the chance to add a user session change :D
[15:17] <BluesKaj> personally i think the greeter page i kde is fugly ...it's greyblue theme is awful
[15:19] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, that's why i'm installing kde, to help d_ed work on his greeter themes
[15:20] <yofel> lightdm-greeter-kde just uses the default kde background by default. (Meaning it looks much better with 4.10...)
[15:20] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, my current greeter theme http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBFlNp13MQ0
[15:20] <BluesKaj> there is an option to change the bckground on the greeter page in system settings login page but it rarely works
[15:23] <FlowRiser> Right, so i guess it installed... fingers crossed.
[15:34] <FlowRiser> BluesKaj, it worked! i now have kde installed, tbh it's slower than unity+compiz, but it looks great
[15:36] <BluesKaj> FlowRiser, kwin uses version of compiz , you can get most of the same effects in kmenu>computer>sytemsettings>desktop effects
[15:37] <BluesKaj> without using compiz
[15:38] <ovidiu-florin_> Hello world, I have a problem with kontact and Kmail, I crashes. I've only managed to set up my Gmail account on it and since then I can't start it anymore. Any Ideeas?
[15:41] <BluesKaj> ovidiu-florin_, unless you need a database email system for work or home office , don't use kmail if it crashes on your system ..I use thunderbird
[15:42] <ovidiu-florin_> then Why does kubuntu ship with Kmail?
[15:45] <BluesKaj> ovidiu-florin_, that's what a lot of KDE users have wonderedd about for the last 3yrs , but one can disable akonadi server for kmail and other PIM apps and instyall aemail of your choice
[15:45] <yofel> ovidiu-florin_: it tries to stick to KDE software whenever possible, sadly kmail is not the most stable piece of software there
[15:45] <ovidiu-florin_> I've tried kmail in the previous release, and I really like it, maybe more than thunderbird
[15:45] <ovidiu-florin_> but it's very unstable
[15:46] <DarthFrog> Which is too bad.  Kmail had a lot of potential.
[15:46] <BluesKaj> ovidiu-florin_, ithink it was an attempt by Canonical to increase penetration into the workplace /market
=== moji_ is now known as moji
[15:46] <yofel> BluesKaj: you may exclusively blame KDE for the current Kontact suite
[15:47] <yofel> debian did the right thing sticking to the old one
[15:47] <BluesKaj> well to include it ..sorry , that was apoor choice of words
[15:47] <BluesKaj> kde is responsible
[15:48] <ovidiu-florin_> ok, Ill go on the #kde channel
[15:48] <BluesKaj> but it doen't work at all on my setup ...segfaults after abot 2 days of use ...as if it gets infected by a virus like windows
[15:48] <yofel> that didn't have anything to do with canonical either, just the kubuntu team
[15:50] <BluesKaj> yofel, yes I'm aware of that , i just never liked Canonicals enterprise motives and suspect that kde4/kmail was convenient for them
[15:51] <yofel> well, if it had been better maybe they would've even used it. Sad that it's not
[15:52] <BluesKaj> but I blame Canoonical for not pushing KDE for a better PIM suite that actually works
[15:52] <DarthFrog> I doubt Canonical would have much influence with the KDE boys.
[15:53] <BluesKaj> too bad
[15:53] <BluesKaj> who does KDE favour then when it comes to OSs
[15:54] <DarthFrog> Yes, I agree.  Lacking a great mail client will hurt KDE in the long run.
[15:54] <DarthFrog> BluesKaj:  I don't have the sense that KDE favours any one distro over any other.
[15:55] <yofel> it's not the default DE on any larger distro I know of either
[15:55] <DarthFrog> yofel:  SuSE?
[15:55] <ovidiu-florin_> I'm searching for an ideea of an application that I want to make and to know that people are using it, maybe this is it: an email client :D
[15:55] <yofel> hm...
[15:55] <BluesKaj> DarthFrog, somew=how i doubt that ..everyone has favs , whether thy admit it or not ...I'd like see what OSs the KDE ppl use in their evreyday work
[15:56] <yofel> DarthFrog: they at least seem to have both gnome and kde on the default DVD
[15:56] <BluesKaj> thunderbird is agood email , I recommend it highly ..easy to setup and use
[15:57] <DarthFrog> yofel:  Which is a desirable thing, IMHO.
[15:57] <DarthFrog> BluesKaj:  I like and use Tbird, too.
[15:57] <DarthFrog> Mainly because Kmail doesn't handle HTML mail properly.
[15:57] <yofel> depends on your target, if a user doesn't know what gnome or kde is then that's debatable
[15:57]  * yofel uses tbird too, because akonadi is too slow
[15:58]  * DarthFrog doesn't see the point in akonadi/nepomuk.  It just consumes resources and gets in the way.
[15:59] <yofel> nepomuk is getting better and better, but akonadi just stays slow :/
[15:59] <BluesKaj> DarthFrog, exactly it's an unecessary burden for ordinary users
[15:59] <yofel> and mysql is even the best working backend -.-
[15:59] <BluesKaj> nepomuk is useless to me
[16:00] <ovidiu-florin_> what exactly is nepomuk and akonadi?
[16:00] <DarthFrog> !akonadi
[16:00] <DarthFrog> !nepomuk
[16:00] <DarthFrog> Ha.  the bot knows nothing about them.

[16:30] <shadeslayer> DarthFrog: I was hoping around the new indexer code
[16:30] <shadeslayer> and it's pretty good
[16:30] <shadeslayer> it's really really fast right now, probably because the indexers don't do alot of things
[16:31] <shadeslayer> I even wrote one to extract data out of ebooks and mobi files, but it didn't get into the repo because if issues
[16:34] <shadeslayer> DarthFrog: my next mini project resulted in this for homerun : http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/09/plasma-desktopwr2226.png
[16:34] <shadeslayer> but I can't get the poster to resize properly right now
[16:36] <DarthFrog> shadeslayer:  Looks nice.
[16:37] <DarthFrog> The one feature I'd like to see added (and it may already be there, IDK) is when I enter text into krunner, that it runs the program of that name instead of some web page, text document or picture.
[16:38] <shadeslayer> actually that would be a wieghting issue with krunner
[16:39] <shadeslayer> DarthFrog: can you give me a test case where I can reproduce this?
[16:39] <shadeslayer> because for eg. if I type quassel, the program always appears before any documents
[16:39] <DarthFrog> shadeslayer:  Not right now off the top of my head.  I will do so the next time I encounter the issue.
[16:40] <shadeslayer> DarthFrog: http://simplest-image-hosting.net/png-0-w11147
[16:40] <shadeslayer> DarthFrog: okay
[16:40] <shadeslayer> KRunner 'learns' as you use it
[16:41] <DarthFrog> I'm trying to recall the last time I encountered the issue.
[16:42] <shadeslayer> :)
[16:42] <shadeslayer> once you find a testcase and can reproduce it on 4.10, then we can poke people in #nepomuk-kde
[16:42] <shadeslayer> or I can go over to Vishesh's house and heckle him :P
[16:42] <DarthFrog> the thing is, I now work around it almost without conscious intervention. :-)
[16:42] <shadeslayer> haha
[16:46] <DarthFrog> shadeslayer:  Has 4.10 been released?  I'm on 4.9.97.
[16:47]  * DarthFrog goes to run dist-upgrade.
[16:47] <yofel> that would be what's current
[16:47] <shadeslayer> heh, 4.9.97 is what will become 4.10 eventually
[16:47] <yofel> DarthFrog: http://techbase.kde.org/Schedules/KDE4/4.10_Release_Schedule
[16:48] <shadeslayer> so if you can reproduce that with 4.10 ( or 4.9.97 for that matter ) , please do file a bug with full test cases :)
[16:48] <DarthFrog> yofel:  Thanks.
[16:49] <DarthFrog> shadeslayer:  I find trying to file a bug to be the equivalent of "a maze of twisty passages, all alike".  I ususally give up in frustration.
[16:49] <shadeslayer> heh
[16:49] <shadeslayer> ok, I agree, bugzilla doesn't have the friendliest user interface

[19:22] <yofel_> install kubuntu in Windows as a program. The system is stored in a file and added to the boot options

[22:29] <ObsequiousNewt> Hello?
[22:30] <ObsequiousNewt> Is anyone here?
[22:33] <musca> yes, just ask.
[22:39] <ObsequiousNewt> Sorry
[22:40] <ObsequiousNewt> Um, I was trying to resize my root partition from a LiveCD.
[22:40] <ObsequiousNewt> I had tested this on a VM with the same conditions and it worked fine.
[22:41] <ObsequiousNewt> But when I actually tried it, the partitioner seemed to freeze up.
[22:41] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: Are you using KDE's partition manager?
[22:41] <ObsequiousNewt> And now I have the partition, which has been resized the way I want it, and it won't boot and in fact is labeled as having no file format.
[22:42] <ObsequiousNewt> Yeah, I was using the one installed by default on the live cd.
[22:42] <ObsequiousNewt> But it worked in the VM...
[22:43] <ObsequiousNewt> So, anyway, I ran boot-repair
[22:43] <ObsequiousNewt> And I got this:
[22:43] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: Hmm, well I had the kde one freeze on me too once. However Gparted (gnome's partition manager) works fine, ever since I have been using that one.
[22:43] <ObsequiousNewt> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529244
[22:44] <ObsequiousNewt> So is it just a bug of the KDE PM?
[22:44] <ObsequiousNewt> More importantly, is my system in any way recoverable?
[22:46] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: What you need to do is some disk checking/repairing. What I can conclude from this message is that the boot sector with Grub is fine, however the first and second partition are in a state where the system doesn't know what it is.
[22:46] <ObsequiousNewt> That's what it looked like.
[22:46] <ObsequiousNewt> Wait, sda2/
[22:46] <ObsequiousNewt> ?
[22:46] <ObsequiousNewt> I didn't do anything to that. Couldn't, either.
[22:47] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: Oh wait nvm, I'm not reading correctly...
[22:48] <Torch> i think it's safe to ignore sda2 and sda5
[22:48] <Torch> sda1
[22:48] <Torch> seems broken
[22:48] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: Do you happen to know what kind of filesystem it was?
[22:48] <Torch> not good
[22:48] <FloodBotK1> Torch: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[22:48] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: Ext4?
[22:48] <ObsequiousNewt> Yeah
[22:48] <ObsequiousNewt> I'm fairly sure
[22:49] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: http://justcheckingonall.wordpress.com/2010/07/18/howto-repair-broken-ext4-partitions/
[22:49] <ObsequiousNewt> It was Kubuntu 12.10 64-bit
[22:49] <ObsequiousNewt> Thanks
[22:49] <ObsequiousNewt> I'll try that
[22:49] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: This is also a good one, actually better: http://linuxexpresso.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/repair-a-broken-ext4-superblock-in-ubuntu/
[22:49] <lordievader> ObsequiousNewt: Or at least I've used the second guide once with a succesfull result :), good luck.
[22:50] <Torch> i doubt fsck will help, it will just say it's not an ext filesystem
[22:50] <ObsequiousNewt> It might.
[22:50] <ObsequiousNewt> I'm going to try both of them, honestly.
[22:51] <Torch> there's gpart (don'T confuse with gparted) for recovery that i have not used myself and another one whose name i forget
[22:52] <Torch> ah, testdisk
[22:52] <Torch> there are a couple of "recovery live cds" where this can be found
[22:54] <Torch> though gpart might be the better tool for your case.... can't tell right now.
[22:54] <ObsequiousNewt> Huh
[22:55] <ObsequiousNewt> Okay, running fsck.ext4 gives me "The superblock could not be read or does not describe a correct ext2 filesystem.
[22:55] <ObsequiousNewt> Despite that it's actually ext4.
[22:55] <Torch> now there was something in that second link about recovering the superblock from one of its backups
[23:02] <ObsequiousNewt> Well, I'm trying that, but they're all complaining of a bad magic number.
[23:03] <Torch> suggesting the backups are dead too
[23:04] <ObsequiousNewt> And the last five say "Invalid argument while trying to open /dev/sda1"
[23:04] <ObsequiousNewt> Odd, that.
[23:06] <ObsequiousNewt> I'm trying gpart.
