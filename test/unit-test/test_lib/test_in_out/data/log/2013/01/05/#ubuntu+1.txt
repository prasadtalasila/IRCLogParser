[04:36] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone here know when 3.8 kernels are expected to start building in raring ?  Was going to go ahead and upgrade rather than re-install 12.10 to fix some random things but noticed that when perusing the kernel archives
[04:36] <FunnyLookinHat> *package archives that is.
[04:37] <FunnyLookinHat> I guess I could just use this if I _really_ wanted to be bleeding edge, eh?  http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.8-rc2-raring/

[09:55] <JohnTeddy> Will upgrades from 12.10  to 13.04 work?
[09:55] <bazhang> now? or when it's released
[09:56] <JohnTeddy> now
[09:56] <bazhang> it's very early in the release cycle, so depends on your meaning of "works"
[09:56] <bazhang> s/release/development/
[09:57] <JohnTeddy> Is it like debian unstable, where the developers are actually using it.. so for the most part is is function.. the UI works, you can do stuff, etc. Sometime it breaks?
[09:57] <bazhang> !info linux
[09:57] <ubottu> linux (source: linux-meta): Generic complete Linux kernel.. In component main, is optional. Version 3.7.0.7.11 (raring), package size 1 kB, installed size 32 kB
[09:57] <JohnTeddy> s/is is/it is/
[09:58] <bazhang> tons of bug fixing and testing. not meant for production use. yeah
[09:59] <JohnTeddy> sudo sed -i 's/quantal/raring/g' /etc/apt/sources.list
[10:00] <JohnTeddy> Is that all I need to do, then update/dist-upgrade?
