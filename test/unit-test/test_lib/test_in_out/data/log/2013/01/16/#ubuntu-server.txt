[00:09] <sarnold> orudie: be confident in your ACLs, back them up with iptables rules. you don't want to run an open proxy for the world.
[00:13] <orudie> sarnold, so in the ACL I can allow by ip or host ?
[00:13] <sarnold> orudie: I would allow by IP, it feels less likely to break
[00:14] <patdk-lap> for the client side
[00:14] <patdk-lap> for the allowed websites to visit, host is fine
[00:14] <orudie> well squid.conf looks huge and difficult to digest for someone who never used it before
[00:15] <orudie> so I just need some guidance
[00:15] <sarnold> orudie: indeed, I remember last time I set it up (10 years back?) spending two or three days reading the manual and configuration file comments...
[00:19] <orudie> sarnold, okay, going to start looking at the conf file now ...
[00:23] <orudie> I wonder what squid enables on default
[00:47] <LeChacal> hello all, i am trying to use the output of "/usr/lib/update-notifier/apt-check" in  a bash script but its output doesn't seem to be going to stout, i can't store its out put to a veriable and even trying to do a redirect to /dev/null still outputs to the stout. Looking at it code it is a python script, i am not formiluar with python so maybe there is something i am missing. Wondering anyone could sheds some light on what is goin go.
[00:48] <sarnold> LeChacal: at least some of the writes are going to standard error
[00:48] <sarnold> LeChacal: programs start with three standard IO streams -- standard input, standard output, and standard error
[00:49] <sarnold> LeChacal: programs can also do IO directly to the terminal, but that is less common
[00:49] <sarnold> LeChacal: it's not so different to capture hte standard error: foo 2> /path/to/file
[00:49] <LeChacal> sarnold: that is bizare all of its output is going to stderr i didn't even think to check that unitl you metioned it
[00:50] <sarnold> LeChacal: so you could have your program capture it like: apt-check > /tmp/output 2> /tmp/error
[00:50] <LeChacal> sarnold: thank you
[00:50] <sarnold> LeChacal: to get both, you could use apt-check 2>&1 > /file/for/output

[02:51] <jdstrand> luminous: '1' is all you need to be first
[02:51] <luminous> jdstrand: except that if you have existing rules there, ufw doesn't gracefully bump the rest down..
[02:51] <jdstrand> sure it will
[02:52] <luminous> it yelled at me about an existing rule.. so I am confused
[02:52] <jdstrand> that is a different error
[02:52] <luminous> oh, I see.. hah
[02:53] <jdstrand> that is telling you that you already have that rule in your ruleset

[04:24] <escott> i confused parted as to the filesystem on a device. It was ext4, then I made it into a raid, then i made it into lvm on top of raid, but parted is still reporting ext4
[04:24] <escott> anything i can do to make it report correctly
[04:24] <escott> partition table is gpt, i dont see anything in the table that indicates ext4
[04:27] <sarnold> escott: isn't that changing the partition type? (82, 83, etc..)
[04:28] <escott> sarnold, no the type is FD00
[04:28] <escott> sarnold, i think parted is reading the contents to try and determine it
[04:28] <sarnold> escott: ah, gpt changed things quite a bit then :)
[04:29] <escott> sarnold, yes and no. "fd" was the old fdisk type, "fd00" is gdisks way of doing the crazy GUID that is the type for raid-autodetect in gpt
[04:30] <escott> technically ext4 is in some sense correct for /dev/sdc1 because I have ext4 inside lvm inside mdadm on /dev/sdc1
[04:30] <escott> but i would rather it say lvm, or none for the filesystem
[04:31] <sarnold> but it'd nice if tools knew exactly what is going on, to save trouble in the hurried wee hours when things break :)
[04:32] <escott> yeah its just confusing to look at that and know its wrong.

[17:05] <RoyK> anti-neutrino: can't you just block ipv6 with iptables?

[18:03] <frojnd> Hi there. Has anyone played and configure ligttpd? I'm having serious problem enabling php support even though by https://help.ubuntu.com/community/lighttpd#PHP I should only lighttpd-enable-mod fastcgi Yet I keep getting 403 - Forbidden
[18:03] <frojnd> When I visit info.php
[18:03] <TheLordOfTime> *cough* use nginx *cough*
[18:03]  * TheLordOfTime is biased
[18:04] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, you should read the error logs
[18:04] <TheLordOfTime> 403 forbidden suggests your file permissions are borked
[18:04] <qhartman> I second the rec for nginx, if you have a good reason to not use Apache....
[18:04] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: what permissions should they be? error log gives me: Path         : /var/www/info.php -- file found
[18:05] <TheLordOfTime> that suggests a 404 not a 403
[18:05] <frojnd> I can pastebin the whole error log
[18:05] <TheLordOfTime> IMO nginx is easier to configure php and proxying than lighty
[18:05] <TheLordOfTime> if that's all you're doing at least
[18:05] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: I'll be using it for wordpress so php mysq
[18:05] <frojnd> something light
[18:06] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, nginx-light can achieve it with some minor configuration
[18:06] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: if you have time I'd be much appriciated if you can bare with me
[18:06] <TheLordOfTime> but i am biased against lighty and apache
[18:06]  * TheLordOfTime works with nginx all the time, and has bug handling specializations in the nginx package
[18:06] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: ok let me try nginx
[18:06] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, if you go the nginx route, sudo apt-get install nginx-light php5-fpm
[18:06] <TheLordOfTime> then lemme give you a basic config
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> also, sudo apt-get install php5-mysql
[18:07] <sarnold> TheLordOfTime: why nginx-light?
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> sarnold, basic core modules
[18:07] <TheLordOfTime> unless they need SSL support, nginx-light is a lighter version of nginx
[18:08] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: in future I'll probably need ssl
[18:08] <frojnd> but in compare how faster is nginx to apache
[18:08] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, then nginx-full
[18:08] <TheLordOfTime> i don't have benchmark stats on bookmark unfortunately
[18:08] <TheLordOfTime> but nginx is a bit lighter on memory IMO
[18:09] <sarnold> TheLordOfTime: ah, save a few kilobytes then :)
[18:09] <TheLordOfTime> sarnold, mhm.
[18:09] <TheLordOfTime> sarnold, unless they say they need SSL and a wider range of modules i suggest nginx-light
[18:09] <TheLordOfTime> which is the barebones but still operational version of nginx
[18:10] <TheLordOfTime> personally, i put nginx-full on all my systems
[18:10] <TheLordOfTime> but all my systems and VMs have at least 512MB RAM so i can spare the few extra kilobytes of RAM
[18:10] <TheLordOfTime> php5 and mysql are the memory whores though
[18:11] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, which ubuntu are you on?
[18:11] <frojnd> 12.4
[18:11] <TheLordOfTime> 12.04 or 12.10?
[18:11] <frojnd> so nginx-full php5-fpm ?
[18:11] <TheLordOfTime> i ask because php5-fpm's listening dynamics were changed for 12.10 and later
[18:11] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, php5-mysql as well
[18:11] <RoyK> TheLordOfTime: heh - mysql only uses what you tell it to use, php can be a bit hungry, though, especially with apache
[18:11] <TheLordOfTime> at the bare minimum
[18:12] <TheLordOfTime> RoyK, apache in and of itself eats more memory than php+mysql combined
[18:12] <TheLordOfTime> which is why i started using nginx :P
[18:12] <RoyK> mod_php is linked into apache, so you'll have to dig deep to see if php or apache is using that memory
[18:12] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, the default configuration file should be sufficient if you uncomment the PHP section, i can go write up a basic config if you want
[18:13] <TheLordOfTime> since i run a wordpress blog on nginx + php5-fpm + mysql
[18:13] <RoyK> php won't use much memory unless it's used :P
[18:13] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: ok all installed nginx-full php5-fpm php5-mysql
[18:13] <RoyK> php with nginx is rather slim, but rather slow as well, compared to apache
[18:13] <RoyK> if you have half a gigabyte, it should suffice for most things
[18:13] <RoyK> 1GB for all
[18:13] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: that would be awesome
[18:14] <TheLordOfTime> RoyK, if you're not running anything intense nginx works fine
[18:14] <TheLordOfTime> with php
[18:14] <RoyK> sure, but something like wordpress is rather intense, so there apache would probably be better
[18:14] <TheLordOfTime> RoyK, lets not argue webserver preference mmkay?
[18:14] <TheLordOfTime> RoyK, they said lighty
[18:14] <frojnd> TheLordOfTime: just please help me :)

[18:19] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, absolute base config: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1538319/
[18:19] <TheLordOfTime> i've commented out the SSL portion, because you don't have SSL yet (I assume)
[18:20] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, NOTE: the followoing must be confirmed:
[18:20] <TheLordOfTime> www-data (user or group) must have read access to the entire directory structure up to the document root
[18:20] <adam_g_> roaksoax: ping
[18:21] <TheLordOfTime> so if you have /home/iamevil/html/blah as the docroot, www-data has to be able to see the directories and read anything in folder 'blah' at the end of that docroot
[18:21] <frojnd> so I must chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/myserver if /var/www/myserver is documentRoot?
[18:21] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, chown -R [user]:www-data at least
[18:22] <frojnd> what do I put for user? you mean ssh user?
[18:22] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, typically, in my /var/www/*, [user] is root
[18:22] <TheLordOfTime> or my ssh user
[18:22] <TheLordOfTime> but typically i put my stuff in userspace

[18:26] <zul> hallyn: my google foo is awesome today
[18:26] <TheLordOfTime> oops resend
[18:27] <TheLordOfTime> i had +g on xD
[18:27] <hallyn> zul: it is - thanks :)
[18:27] <TheLordOfTime> frojnd, resend the privmsg
[18:27] <roaksoax> adam_g_: pong
[18:27]  * TheLordOfTime had filtering on and did not receive the privmsg initially
[18:28] <roaksoax> adam_g_: whats up? :)
[18:28] <adam_g_> roaksoax: hey, was just looking at the hacluster charm for use with rabbitmq.
[18:29] <roaksoax> adam_g_: ok...
[18:29] <adam_g_> roaksoax: i had some questions but reading the code answered most of them. i might make a MP against ~openstack-charmers/charms/quantal/hacluster/trunk that will avoid installing openstack-resource-agents unless they're actually needed
[18:30] <roaksoax> adam_g_: cool! :) just let me know if you have any left or want to merge something
[18:36] <hallyn> zul: alas, those two patches don't fix it
[18:36] <zul> hallyn: ergh
[18:36] <zul> lemme finish what im doing here and ill have a look
[18:37] <hallyn> aha /usr/include/linux/if_bridge.h:172:20: error: field 'ip6' has incomplete type
[18:37] <hallyn> zul: no, wait, i think the second patch had a thinko
[18:44] <hallyn> zul:  i think this is technically a bug in the kernel headers, so asking on #ubuntu-kernel

[19:16] <diegosnat> is it true that zentyal sync active directory users with emails?
[19:19] <adam_g_> roaksoax: have you ever seen this trace upon adding thre relation between subordinate and primary service? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1538474/
[19:23] <roaksoax> adam_g_: nope never
[19:26] <roaksoax> adam_g_: are you doing rabbitmq with drbd?
[19:27] <adam_g_> roaksoax: not yet. gonna start with mirrored queues
[19:27] <roaksoax> ack!

[20:31] <Free99> hey everyone. I have a bunch of VMs running on what needs to be a publicly accessible bridge. Advice I keep getting is to disable iptables and arptables on the bridge using sysctl, but if I'd rather limit access by using specific iptables rules, is that possible?
[20:34] <adam_g_> roaksoax: will is_clustered() // "clustered=`relation-get -r $r_id clustered $unit`" only return True if the cluster is configured/crm is up/the resources are active and not waiting on more peers?
[20:42] <roaksoax> adam_g_: where is that?
[20:45] <adam_g_> roaksoax: cinder/glance
[20:45]  * roaksoax looks
[20:46] <adam_g_> roaksoax: found what i was looking for, but yea. hacluster sets 'clustered' in its relation when its done with cluster bootstrap, so that clustered services know the cluster is actually up
[20:47] <roaksoax> adam_g_: exactly
[20:47] <roaksoax> adam_g_: keystone implements it differently
[20:47] <roaksoax> ah no
[20:47] <roaksoax> it is is just it is in shell
[20:47] <roaksoax> :)
[20:48] <adam_g_> roaksoax: which of the charms actually request a resource be created with an RA from the openstack-resource-agents package?
[20:49] <roaksoax> adam_g_: quantum
[20:50] <roaksoax> tha's the only one so far
[20:50] <adam_g_> ah
[20:54] <roaksoax> adam_g_: btw.. are you using canonistack?
[20:55] <adam_g_> roaksoax: no
[20:56] <adam_g_> roaksoax: is openstack-resouce-agents available for precise somewhere? i'd be great if this hacluster could be used on releases since 12.04
[20:56] <roaksoax> adam_g_: nope it is not
[20:56] <roaksoax> adam_g_: i was planning on getting it into the cloud-archive if possible

[22:54] <lvmer1> My minidlna files.db  only shows approx. 9000 audio files, while the folder has 38,000. I've increased the watches & I've forced several reloads, but I still get the exact same number 9000 something audio files.  All the 25,000 picture files show up perfectly, so I'm curious what the problem is. All the audio files are mp3
