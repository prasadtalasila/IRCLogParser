[00:11] <zequence> The Ubuntu phone version was announced https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=LoXpLUr5WB4
[00:15] <zequence> I'm not at all convinced about the UI, but it's cool if you can install anything you want on it
[00:18] <ttoine> zequence, the UI is more "I don't want it to look like the other to avoid law and patents problems" with the left panel of unity
[00:20] <ttoine> ScottL, I changed to everybody
[00:20] <ttoine> ttoine@ttoine.net
[00:20] <ttoine> sorry about that...
[00:51] <ScottL> zequence, do you have a preferred email to send you admin invite?
[00:54] <ScottL> i think i got ttoine set up, zequence please let me know if you do not receive an invite
[03:47] <ScottL> oh, i almost forgot, len-1304 , i've been thinking about shotwell
[03:49] <ScottL> i think that digikam is useful for importing raw pictures and updating/setting the EXIM data for the pictures, i'm not sure that shotwell can do that
[03:49] <ScottL> i'm speculating that shotwell is more "pedestrian" rather than for professionals in that sense
[03:50] <ScottL> perhaps shotwell could be in the desktop meta and digikam (or whatever else is decided) can go into the photo meta
[03:50] <ScottL> but i'm thinking through the work flow still to see what is needed
[04:54] <Len-nb> ScottL, I was mainly adding notes just so the where we are now to where we want to go has some record.
[04:55] <Len-nb> Adding apps is fine, but if we have where we've been we can remember to remove stuff no longer needed.
[04:56] <Len-nb> So when we start moving from white board to blueprint things can be solid.
[04:58] <holstein> darktable is the most like lightroom
[04:58] <holstein> not that that matters
[04:58] <holstein> i like that idea ScottL 
[04:59] <holstein> shotwell in the desktp and digikam and/or lightroom on the phto
[04:59] <holstein> what does xubuntu ship? shotwell?
[05:01] <ScottL> Len-nb, i should be writing up the photography work flow on the wiki or website, hopefully that will help people understand as well
[05:01] <ScottL> holstein, i'm not sure what xubuntu ships, my laptop (which i'm using now) was actually a vanilla install with xubuntu-desktop put on top of it
[05:02] <holstein> i think we should ship whatever they have
[05:02] <holstein> and then decide what tool or tools to ship for the pro side
[05:02] <holstein> doesnt have to be just one
[05:03] <holstein> darktable is the big one right now though, since its light-room like
[05:03] <Len-nb> holstein, xubuntu has been shipping less every release to keep things on a CD
[05:30] <Len-nb> holstein, xubutu uses gthumb and ristretto
[05:30] <ScottL> that's kinda funny to me because i seem to remember that the -releaes team was talking about moving away from cd size images, but i might be misremembering
[05:31] <Len-nb> xubutu may have their own ideas
[05:31] <Len-nb> my 12.04 says it has ristretto in it but I don't see it in the menu
[05:32] <Len-nb> Ah, accessories.
[05:42] <Len-nb> It has problems with png files, but is fine with jpg.
[07:04] <zequence> ScottL: I had another email adress before. I changed it to the one you used, so please try adding me again
[11:48] <ttoine> ScottL, thanks ! I found another facebook page : https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ubuntu-Studio/277602442279689
[11:49] <ttoine> you know what it is ?
[11:49] <ttoine> and second question, where can I find svg logos of ubuntu studio ?
[12:30] <zequence-w> ttoine: We should put together the material for theming, which we can use for all sites
[12:30] <zequence-w> Perhaps put up a bzr branch for it
[12:32] <ttoine> zequence, or like xubuntu, make a page on the website
[12:33] <zequence-w> ttoine: That would probably be better, yes
[12:34] <zequence-w> ttoine: That fb page you linked is not ours, but they are using png's from our website
[12:35] <zequence-w> Made by me, in fact :P
[12:35] <ttoine> zequence, oh ok
[12:35] <ttoine> I just get some artwork from wikipedia
[12:36] <ttoine> just check https://www.facebook.com/Ubuntustudio
[12:36] <ttoine> zequence, can you send the banner you used for your ubuntu studio page so that I can integrate it ?
[12:37] <ttoine> zequence-w
[12:38] <ttoine> I will have to be carefull for the -w
[12:38] <zequence-w> ttoine: Knome is responsible for the page layout. The banner you can download, if you right click at it
[12:38] <zequence-w> knome is the author of the theme
[12:39] <zequence-w> ttoine: We'll probably redo the banner though
[12:39] <zequence-w> I'd like to add the slogan "Linux for creative humans"
[12:39] <ttoine> zequence, the banner of the facebook page
[12:39] <ttoine> zequence-w
[12:39] <ttoine> me too
[12:40] <zequence-w> ah, sorry. I noticed the banner could not be viewed easily from the web page
[12:41] <zequence-w> ttoine: I'm not an artist, but I could make a new version of the banner. We should probably have one with and one without the round logo
[12:41] <zequence-w> For the fb page, since we use the round logo for the profile pic, we don't need it in the banner
[12:42] <zequence-w> In fact, the plan was to polish the front page for the web site a bit
[12:43] <zequence-w> I've set up a staging site for us
[12:44] <zequence-w> The original round logo is in blue though
[12:44] <zequence-w> I like the blue better, but it may depend on what the background is, if it is good to use it
[12:44] <ttoine> zequence, ok. maybe you have a link to the picture file of the banner you used for you facebook page ?
[12:45] <zequence-w> I mean, the actual symbol, in blue
[12:45] <zequence-w> ttoine: I didn't do the fb page. Must be ScottL 
[12:45] <zequence-w> I'm not admin yet
[12:45] <zequence-w> ttoine: You should find it in pictures
[12:46] <ttoine> zequence, https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ubuntu-Studio/277602442279689
[12:46] <ttoine> and https://www.facebook.com/Ubuntustudio
[12:46] <ttoine> are not the same
[12:47] <zequence-w> ttoine: The first link is not ours
[12:47] <zequence-w> They're just using png images from our website
[12:47] <zequence-w> It's a new page, with very few visitors
[12:47] <ttoine> ok
[12:48] <ttoine> need to go, bbl
[13:25] <ScottL> zequence, "We weren't able to add all your new admins. You can only add your friends or people who already like this Page"
[13:26] <ScottL> we can work on it again this evening after i get home from work
[13:26] <ScottL> zequence, i'm not sure who did the facebook page, jussi was in charge of it until he added me as admin
[13:26] <ScottL> i'm not sure who the other page is or who created it
[13:50] <zequence-w> KDE != cool. KDE == kool.
[14:06] <astraljava> wut?
[14:07] <astraljava> Yes.
[14:27] <scott-work> good morning everyone
[14:27] <scott-work> would someone be able to help Martin Owen with some midi help? it doesn't sound to difficult, but I am far from a midi expert: https://plus.google.com/u/0/102241005050666075649/posts/L7N5AnJ8D8w?cfem=1
[14:28] <scott-work> zequence: i brought my laptop to work so i most likely will be able to work directly with you during the day to get the facebook admin set up
[14:29] <scott-work> strangely, we have a device called 'sonicwall' that blocks certain things, like facebook and flickr, from our desktop computers. however, if i use my personal laptop with the wifi i get around that :P
[14:29] <zequence-w> scott-work: I liked the page before, and changed my email adress to the one you used. Should be fine now
[14:29] <scott-work> but then again, if i am overtly using my personal laptop all day, people (including my boss) _will_ notice ;)
[14:30] <zequence-w> I wonder if Korn are heavy KDE users
[14:30] <zequence-w> Kould be?
[14:31] <scott-work> lol
[14:36] <scott-work> zequence-w: done :)
[14:47] <zequence-w> scott-work: ty
[14:47] <scott-work> yw
[14:48] <scott-work> i'm guessing ttoine made the changes to the facebook logo/image. it looks *much* better than before :)
[14:48] <scott-work> zequence-w: i am thinking about adding ttoine to the g+ page as well. is there a reason not to do so?
[14:52] <zequence-w> scott-work: Please add him. I think he was the one who made the changes, yes. But we should redo it again, properly. And making sure all the social sites have correct theming
[14:52] <zequence-w> I think the way the fb page looks now is probably what we are all thinking, but missing the slogan
[14:52] <zequence-w> And let's make sure the details are what we want
[14:53] <zequence-w> We really should make all those pages look as similar as possible, so that there is no confusion as to if the page is official or not
[14:56] <zequence-w> going home
[15:51] <zequence> scott-work: Who made the white version of the US symbol (blue background)
[15:51] <zequence> I kind of liked it when it was blue, and no background
[15:52] <scott-work> zequence: that was me and cory
[15:52] <zequence> scott-work: Would be nice to have someone responsible of the art, and do some color experimentation. Like, white against black, and that sort of thing. Alternative theming
[15:53] <scott-work> zequence: i tried that years ago, waaaay before i had _any_ profeciency with inkscape ;)
[16:14] <zequence> scott-work: How does this look? https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12809728/sans.png
[16:15] <scott-work> i think it look good!
[16:15] <scott-work> *looks*
[16:15] <scott-work> i saw something yesterday that prompted me to also suggest "open to creativity" or similar
[16:16] <scott-work> but i'm good with what you have right now
[16:16] <zequence> I'm no artists, so whatever I do is going to be very simple. That's just the Sans Italic font
[16:17] <zequence> I imagine one could bake in something like a audio wave image in there. Do something graphically to make the whole thing become more alive
[16:17] <zequence> But, perhaps this would be a good start
[16:18] <zequence> I'd like to suggest this(or something improved) for all our sites then.
[16:20] <scott-work> i think we should as well. let's start with this, get it consistent across all platforms. it looks good and much, much better than what we have already
[16:21] <scott-work> if we can develop something we like better, then we can iterate to that
[16:21] <scott-work> we could even crowdsource for ideas or art on those platforms
[16:23] <zequence> Yea. I'll put together some art tomorrow. I think probably all the sites will need a bit different dimensions, etc. And finally, I'll put everything on a wiki page somehwere
[16:25] <zequence> Then, if everyones fine with it, we can just implement it. I need to start working on the front web page with knome too. Add the slogan, and polish the layout (add a header that says "News")
[16:25] <zequence> We'll stage the changes first on the site I set up
[16:43] <scott-work> that sounds awesome :)
[19:24] <scott-work> photos i took at my father's over the holidays: https://plus.google.com/100313956509426913392/posts/8LvvQX7PhPh
[19:24] <scott-work> this is part of the process where i'm working through the photography workflow (not that i'm doing too much in these photos mind you)
[19:47] <scott-work> ttoine: the new logo stuff for the facebook page looks good, did you do that?
[20:01] <ttoine> scott-work, the fantom of ubuntu studio did that, perhaps ;-)
[20:01] <scott-work> LOL
[20:02] <ttoine> scott-work, nice place, your father's home
[20:03] <ttoine> a kind of ranch ?
[20:03] <ttoine> scott-work, i noticed you added me to the google + page too
[20:04] <scott-work> ttoine: thank you. my father (rightly so) is very proud of his house and land, after loosing everything twice in divorce has worked *very* hard to achieve his dream
[20:04] <ttoine> is there a linkedin page too ?
[20:05] <ttoine> scott-work, my wife and I are dreaming of a place like that, with horses
[20:05] <scott-work> he lives out in the country with a very nice house that he did a majority of the work to complete after it was framed and "dried in" (meaning basically weatherproof but with concrete floor and stud walls)
[20:05] <ttoine> I hope this is possible with cable internet services ;-)
[20:06] <ttoine> scott-work, great work. It is not very common to build house this way in europe
[20:06] <scott-work> i helped him pull wire, do electrical outlets. he had specialists do certain things (like the large, marble shower) but he did a lot of work on it
[20:06] <scott-work> ttoine: i did add you to the g+ page. i asked zequence if thought it was a good idea, he agreed it was.
[20:07] <scott-work> i would really like to have a consistent group working on all the various social media. i really don't want to fragment people against the channels, unless someone doesn't particularly like one of them ;)
[20:08] <scott-work> and you obviously have knowledge and ability for the social channels ;)
[20:09] <ttoine> scott-work, thank you for your confidence
[20:09] <ttoine> scott-work, is there a Linked In official page ?
[20:10] <scott-work> ttoine: what i have been expressing to zequence is a strong desire to DO. i think we (i know i have been) worry to much about making things "perfect" and never get _anything_ accomplished. i would rather push something out and then iterate as necessary
[20:10] <scott-work> oh, sorry. didn't answer that. i don't believe there is. at least i am not aware of a linked page
[20:10] <scott-work> *linked in*
[20:10] <scott-work> (but then again, i didn't know about the guy on twitter or the guy on identi.ca either)
[20:11] <ttoine> oh yes... there is identica too to manage, I forget this one
[20:13] <scott-work> i would imagine if we focus on the main three (g+, facebook, twitter) right now then we should get over 80% of the coverage needed
[20:14] <scott-work> not to say that we can't pick up any of the other channels later or that we shouldn't pick them up, but if we focus on getting these correct right NOW, we'll be doing good :)
[20:14] <scott-work> ttoine: i have a @ubuntu.com email account as a memeber, i could probably talk to the twitter people about kicking that guy off of @ubuntustudio
[20:15] <scott-work> or we could always pick @TheRealUbuntuStudio or @ubuntustudio.org or @whateverubuntustudio or @ubuntu-studio
[20:15] <ttoine> scott-work, so first, you will need to create a ubuntustudio1 account or something like that
[20:15] <ttoine> then, there is a form to fill to request the account
[20:16] <scott-work> i can create the account tonight at home, do you have a link or can tell me where to look for the form?
[20:16] <ttoine> scott-work, @ubuntustudio.org is available
[20:17] <ttoine> sorry
[20:17] <ttoine> @ubuntustudioorg
[20:17] <ttoine> wait a second for the link
[20:17] <scott-work> i would say let's try to get @ubuntustudio first since it seems we may have a viable path to do so, if this begins to look bad or takes too long we can choose an alternate
[20:18] <scott-work> but if we don't have @ubuntustudio within a month, maybe we should just move on and pick antoher
[20:19] <ttoine> scott-work, https://support.twitter.com/forms/impersonation
[20:20] <scott-work> ttoine: thank you
[20:20] <ttoine> and choose "a user is pretending to be or representative of the company, brand or organization"
[20:21] <ttoine> scott-work, it is easy to find the url again in the help center of twitter
[21:53] <scott-work> ttoine: i created the @ubuntustudio1 account and filed the impersonation report
[21:53] <scott-work> let's hope it works :)
[21:55] <ttoine> scott-work: i am just testing irc from android before sleeping. Can you remember me tomorrow to send you thé email of the contact of pleia2 ?
[21:55] <scott-work> ttoine: absolutely. good night :)
[21:57] <ttoine> Tanks.
[21:58] <ttoine> Thanks
