[18:10] <mmcc> ralsina: I am having a hard time staying connected to the canonical IRC server, so if anyone needs me, I'll be over here
[18:10] <ralsina> mmcc: happy to relay :-)
[18:11] <mmcc> most annoying part of that - emacs ERC refuses to give up trying to reconnect, and emacs blocks while it tries
[18:11] <mmcc> 2013!
[18:36] <ralsina> mmcc: well, emacs lives in its own 1994 time bubble.
[18:44] <mmcc> ralsina (and briancurtin3 ): so I guess we still haven't actually put up the updates.json at ouc/updates/updates.json
[18:44] <briancurtin3> mmcc: is there an RT for it?
[18:44] <mmcc> it 404s, so existing clients just treat that as no update available.
[18:45] <mmcc> briancurtin3: maybe not - it was part of the 'post the mac release' RT but IIRC we said it was OK to postpone
[18:49] <ralsina> mmcc: so we need to upload it
[18:49] <ralsina> mmcc: either comment on the existing RT or start a new one for the 4.0.1 and put it there
[18:50] <mmcc> ok
[18:52] <mmcc> briancurtin3: also noticed that the update.conf file isn't in source control anywhere. need to figure out where to put it, since it might be different for mac/win
[18:52] <mmcc> to build, I put it in u1-win-installer/scripts/data  (in setup-mac, py2app picks up things in that dir as bundle resources).
[18:52] <briancurtin3> mmcc: on windows that file is created by the installer builder, it's inside of ubuntuone.xml in -windows-installer
[18:53] <mmcc> briancurtin3: is that in the new process or the old ?
[18:53] <briancurtin3> mmcc: however, i'm not sure it needs to be, it's just how it was when i came on and i've stuck with it so it's less places to keep version numbers up to date
[18:54] <mmcc> do you use win-installer/scripts/data?
[18:54] <mmcc> I should really make that a template
[18:55] <briancurtin3> mmcc: there are things in there, it could just go in there since the logging.conf and sd files are in there
[18:56] <mmcc> yeah, they get generated or copied there. only the mac template and qt.conf files are in version control in that dir
[18:57] <mmcc> ok, I'll check it in there, and in the future I'll make it a template so building with a new version number doesn't mean checking in a new update.conf
[21:14] <sysdoc> The last that I heard there was no encryption for the files on the ubuntu one system, has anyone come up with a scheme to have the data encrypted prior uploading, and have the data avaliable to both Windows and Ubuntu systems?
[23:41] <karni> Hi folks. Any Android users out here?
