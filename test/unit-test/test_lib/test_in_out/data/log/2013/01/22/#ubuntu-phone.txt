[11:55] <_raven> hi
[11:55] <_raven> will ubuntu phones be developed for asus padphone 2 too?
[11:59] <popey> not sure that's been determined yet
[12:01] <ChaozHenchman> well it has all the specs needed for the superphone
[12:01] <_raven> any way to make a request for it?
[12:05] <ChaozHenchman> I guess you would need to email ASUS and ask them to work with Canonical
[12:06] <ChaozHenchman> but they won't make phones till next year
[12:06] <ChaozHenchman> so don't worry about it right now?
[12:06] <ChaozHenchman> is that phone on the market yet?
[12:07] <ChaozHenchman> I'm not seein a price
[12:07] <_raven> yes padphone 2
[12:11] <_raven> ChaozHenchman you found it?
[12:11] <ChaozHenchman> it doesn't say anything about US carriers and prices
[12:12] <ChaozHenchman> even though the articles were made in October
[12:13] <_raven> look at amazon for example. at least in germany its available
[12:16] <ChaozHenchman> http://www.amazon.com/Asus-ASUS-Padfone2-Station-64G/dp/B00A45G66I/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358856929&sr=8-1&keywords=asus+padfone+2
[12:16] <ChaozHenchman> yeah, it's pretty overpriced
[12:17] <_raven> yes it is but i look at the 32 gb model
[12:18] <_raven> but think about buying a similar tablet and smartphone alone
[12:19] <_raven> and i need both so its nearly a combined price
[12:20] <_raven> but in germany its not so expensive as in $->â‚¬

[16:27] <spobat> hi
[16:28] <spobat> sorry, but I don't get it. Why to prefer ubuntu-phone over android?
[16:30] <arij> you dont have to prefer it
[16:30] <spobat> well if it has no advantages, why does it exist at all?
[16:31] <spobat> ( sorry for the provocative language)
[16:32] <GuidoPallemans> hav you seen the industry proposition?
[16:33] <spobat> I'm not sure
[16:33] <om26er> then you should.. I think you are even asking the wrong question ;)

[16:35] <ChaozHenchman> do you think that the phone will come after the April 2014 release?
[16:36] <ChaozHenchman> since it's LTS?
