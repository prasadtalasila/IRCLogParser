[00:13] <Combat_Wombat> yes sadly alternatives lack very seriously in the graphics department so its vmware workstation for bust for what I need it for :D
[00:15] <Bleu700> any one home ?
[00:17] <Combat_Wombat> many people
[00:17] <Bleu700> cool
[00:18] <Bleu700> 12.10 how do I turn the screen lock off?
[00:19] <Combat_Wombat> but on the vmware workstation thing it is having the same problem I am having with teamspeak3. Some fairly significant audio problems
[00:24] <wxl> Combat_Wombat: have you tried looking for a vmware-related channel?
[00:25] <Combat_Wombat> nope just got my first vm setup havent gotten very far yet
[00:25] <wxl> there is a #vmware here
[00:26] <wxl> it's registered
[00:26] <wxl> max users last two weeks is 428
[00:26] <wxl> i imagine there's someone there who can help you XD

[03:06] <user02938> Noticed some problems with Lubuntu:
[03:06] <user02938> 1:  Chromium browser isn't compatible with ebay. Won't allow photo uploading and text formatting.
[03:07] <user02938> 2:  Lubuntu is missing WiFi functionality (that works fine in Kubuntu).
[03:08] <user02938> 3. Google Chrome refuses to install in Lubuntu.  Fails with errors during install.
[03:13] <user02938> Now back to Chromium browser:   The fact that chromium is not compatible with ebay is a serious flaw since ebay is a  popular website for business.  But Google chrome (windows version) works fine with ebay.
[03:13] <TheLordOfTime> chrome installs fine in my 12.10 VM
[03:14] <TheLordOfTime> and Lubuntu works fine with my wifi, you probably just need to add additional drivers
[03:14] <mysteriousdaren> it installed in my 12.04 laptop and 12.10 netbook
[03:14]  * TheLordOfTime has a 12.10 VM because his 12.04 actually-installed system has a broken /boot
[03:14] <mysteriousdaren> user02938: how did you install? cli?
[03:15] <user02938> mysteriousdaren,  I installed google chrome from google's website.
[03:16] <user02938> during the install process it fails with errors.
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> not here
[03:16] <user02938> I'm using lubuntu 12.04... Let me try again.
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> all it needs on here is libgconf.
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> user02938, what "errors" is it throwing
[03:16] <TheLordOfTime> you're probably just missing dependencies.
[03:16] <user02938> just a moment..
[03:17] <mysteriousdaren> try lubuntu software center, or synaptic
[03:18] <TheLordOfTime> google chrome installs correctly, and runs correctly, in 12.10
[03:18]  * TheLordOfTime spins up his 12.04 VM
[03:26] <user02938> Ok, Google chrome installed fine on this 32bit PC.
[03:26] <TheLordOfTime> and after i install libcurl3 in 12.04, the chrome installer works, and chrome correctly runs.
[03:26] <TheLordOfTime> works 64bit too, but i needed libcurl3
[03:26] <TheLordOfTime> and libgconf on 12.10
[03:27] <user02938> Well it refused to install in Lubuntu 64bit on my HP pavilion.
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> and you're not telling us the errors it said
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> so we can't really help you much
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> it usually says what errors you're having
[03:28] <user02938> I'm using my 32bit pc right now, so I'll bootup my 64bit PC and try again...Back in a few mins..
[03:28] <TheLordOfTime> and i'm pretty certain the issue is you need to manually install the dependencies
[03:28] <user02938> it errored during the "man" installation
[03:29] <user02938> give me 10mins or so to check...
[03:34] <hpuser2323> << I'm the person with the google chrome problem.  I'm installing in 64bit.. almost done...
[03:35] <hpuser2323> it says I have broken dependancies and i need to run 'sudo apt-get install -f'. So i'm doing that now
[03:37] <TheLordOfTime> hpuser2323, it usually says the dependencies
[03:37] <TheLordOfTime> if apt-get install -f fails, specify them manually
[03:37] <hpuser2323> almost finished..
[03:38] <hpuser2323> It installed OK this time.
[03:39] <hpuser2323> Now I need to test how it works with ebay.
[03:39] <hpuser2323> So what are the wifi packages i need for Dlink USB Wifi adapter?
[03:40] <hpuser2323> (that was the wifi that failed to work in lubuntu but worked fine in Kubuntu)
[03:44] <mysteriousdaren> hpuser2323: search for your specific adapter on dlink and find the linux driver
[03:44] <hpuser2323> The fact that Kubuntu works fine with it, would indicate that Kubuntu already has the open source driver installed, and lubuntu does not.  So the question is, what driver is missing in Lubuntu.
[03:45] <hpuser2323> suppose i need to lsmod in kubuntu and check the differences in lubuntu?
[03:47] <hpuser2323> I prefer to download the driver from the lubuntu repos but I'll download from dlink if need be.
[03:49] <hpuser2323> I'll boot kubuntu so I can check what driver modules are installed for dlink wifi
[03:57] <user02938> hmm..   Lubuntu is missing a lot of wifi drivers compared to kubuntu.
[03:58] <TheLordOfTime> Most HPs i've seen across my workbench deploy those cards which need additional drivers, so perhaps that's the issue
[04:00] <dap> i'm trying to get lubuntu12.10-amd64 running off of a usb stick; everything works out-of-the-box when running from cd, but when running off the stick(installed via unetbootin), wireless and my trackpad don't work. any ideas?
[04:00] <user02938> Well i'm looking at the kubuntu kernel modules > net > wifi and there's a lot of drivers there. But Lubutu is missing many of them.
[04:01] <user02938> dap..ah another wireless problem..  I'm looking into that now.
[04:02] <dap> i find it rather odd that it works out of the box, but not running off the stick.
[04:06] <user02938> the usb installer could have failed to include the drivers during install..only speculating...
[04:07] <user02938> My hard drive install is missing wifi drivers also...trying to figure out why..
[04:11] <dap> that's possible. i'll try to find where they're located
[04:14] <holstein> !broadcom is a good reference

[04:17] <user02938> My Dlink wifi uses rt3070 chipset and the driver isn't loading in lubuntu.  Drivers rtlwifi are missing.
[04:18] <holstein> user02938: you can try the windows drivers with ndisgtk
[04:19] <user02938> holstein..thanks, will keep that in mind.  I just manually loaded the kernel driver with "sudo modprobe -r rtlwifi"
[04:20] <user02938> will have to disconnect my ethernet now and test wifi. Later..
[04:20] <holstein> user02938: if you havent tested, then id say you dont know that it is working
[04:20] <holstein> i would search "ubuntu rtwhatever". the line from lspci that desibes the hardware
[04:21] <holstein> i have one and i just load the windows driver.. works fine
[04:21] <user02938> yes i just google for information and i found my chipset so i loaded the realtek driver. Testing now

[05:34] <hpuser2323> Sylpheed mail refuses to add a second email account.
[05:35] <hpuser2323> refuses to switch between the 2 accounts and won't display the accounts in the left panel.
[05:37] <holstein> hpuser2323: i havent used it.. i would go right to http://sylpheeddoc.sourceforge.net/en/faq/faq.html
[05:37] <holstein> unless you find a bug report you can get envolved with... with some helpful ideas
[05:37] <holstein> OR, just use another client
[05:37] <hpuser2323> Sylpheed has a help menu with the manual which i'm looking at...trying to make sense of it.
[05:37] <holstein> i havent used an actual client since gmail started letting me pop other mail into it..
[05:42] <hpuser2323> Looks like sylpheed is bug ridden.  Not responding to my setup
[05:43] <hpuser2323> not even displaying the account I added.
[05:43] <Unit193> Is the other one that is pretty close to it working, claws I think?  I personally either use the webUI, but mostly Alpine.
[05:44] <Unit193> There was some other basic email client, but can't remember what it was... >_>\
[05:44] <hpuser2323> i'll check
[05:45] <hpuser2323> no, claws isn't installed.  Never mind, I'll use thunderbird or something else.
[05:47] <holstein> i would use thunderbird.. its not "heavy" and its well supported, even though frozen developmentally
[05:47] <hpuser2323> yes i'm familiar with thunderbird.  I have used Sylpheed before (in other linux's) but this sylpheed isn't working for some reason.  So thunderbird it is.

[11:47] <flybelow> Hello, I need a little help, but it seems my messages are not getting through. Can someone please confirm you can see me?
[11:48] <flybelow> People don't reply to me, and most of my messages don't turn up in the log. Strange.

[13:45] <flybelow> Hey. I have Lubuntu 11.10 and I always log in as root, automatically. I don't need to enter any password, there is no login screen. Now I installed Lubuntu 12.04 and the system is logging in automatically as the unprivileged user right after boot. How do I make it log in automatically as root, like it does in my older 11.10 installation?

[18:32] <R12Onu> Hello :-)
[18:33] <R12Onu> Is there a way to change the Synaptic Package Manager in Lubuntu 12.10 to something more like in Ubuntu?
[18:33] <R12Onu> I mean... friendly?
[18:33] <R12Onu> With ratings and such
[18:33] <TheLordOfTime> R12Onu, use something else perhaps?
[18:34] <TheLordOfTime> Synaptic's not built to be that versatile
[18:34] <R12Onu> Such as?
[18:34] <R12Onu> I'm pretty new to linux...
[18:34]  * TheLordOfTime shrugs
[18:34] <TheLordOfTime> i pretty much just install everything via command line, so i'm less dependent on GUI features.
[18:34] <R12Onu> I don't use the command line at all :-D
[18:35] <R12Onu> I use the mouse
[18:35] <TheLordOfTime> meh, i'm a packager, i need the command line for things :P
[18:36] <R12Onu> So you must know a better package manager!
[18:36] <R12Onu> ;-)
[18:37] <R12Onu> What's the package manager in Ubuntu?
[18:39] <Combat_Wombat> isnt there that  ubuntu software center thing? it comes with lubuntu too
[18:40] <R12Onu> Oh, haven't noticed that
[18:40] <R12Onu> but its far from as friendly as the ubuntu one
[18:40] <R12Onu> with the ratings and such
[18:41] <Combat_Wombat> well if you remember whatever you are looking for is called i am sure its a package you can shoehorn into lubuntu
[18:42] <R12Onu> I'm mostly looking for new games and such
[18:42] <R12Onu> don't really know what I'm looking for
[18:42] <Combat_Wombat> well ill save you the time there are no good games in the repositories save maybe freeciv but even thats stretching it :D
[18:43] <Unit193> There is the Lubuntu software center, but if you don't like it, Ubuntu software center should work as well.
[18:43] <Unit193> Xonotic is in the repos now, last I knew.
[18:44] <R12Onu> I think I managed to download the Ubuntu thingy :-D
[18:45] <R12Onu> One last thing - can I remove the password pop-up window from Lubuntu?
[18:45] <R12Onu> I don't worry about anyone that don't know the password using the computer so its pretty pointless
