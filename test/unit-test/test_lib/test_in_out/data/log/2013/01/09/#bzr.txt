=== slank is now known as slank_away
[07:56] <didrocks> hey mmrazik, do you have some logs about the issues we are currently having in corrupted checkouts?
[07:56] <didrocks> (knowing that we just started fresh from trunk)
[07:57] <mmrazik> pretty much just the output of "bzr branch lp:~mrazik/libdbusmenu/xvfb-run-a"
[07:57] <mmrazik> let me pastebing that
[07:57] <mmrazik> err.. sorry.. output of " bzr checkout lp:~mrazik/libdbusmenu/xvfb-run-a
[07:57] <mmrazik> "
[07:57] <mmrazik> bzr branch works fine
[07:58] <mmrazik> http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1512096/
[07:58] <didrocks> vila: jelmer: hey! would you have any idea of what can be the cause of this? ^
[07:58] <mmrazik> the steps to reproduce are: 1. bzr branch lp:libdbusmenu
[07:58] <mmrazik> 2. make your changes + commit
[07:59] <mmrazik> 3. bzr push
[07:59] <mmrazik> 4. bzr checkout (from the same location where you just pushed)
[08:00] <didrocks> mmrazik: easier, bzr checkout lp:libdbusmenu has the same issue
[08:00] <didrocks> so something not correct in the launchpad repo?
[08:03] <vila> didrocks, mmrazik : weird, when tried locally I got an additional hint in the error message: "Run 'bzr reconcile --canonicalize-chks' on the affected repository."
[08:04] <vila> which doesn't appear in your paste...
[08:04] <mmrazik> vila: I tried that on my xvfb-run-a repo (locally) and then pushed to xvfb-run-a2 but it didn't help
[08:04] <didrocks> vila: I don't see this hint as well
[08:05] <vila> mmrazik: well, if the lp repo has the issue, fixing your local one won't help (and you may be additionally tricked if the offended repo is stacked on on lp)
[08:06] <didrocks> vila: so bzr reconcile --canonicalize-chks :parent?
[08:07] <vila> hmm, "bzr info -v lp:libdbusmenu" erroring is suspicious, is the lp branch properly configured ?
[08:07] <didrocks> ah interesting, indeed
[08:07] <vila> bzr config -d lp:libdbusmenu
[08:07] <vila> branch:
[08:07] <vila>   stacked_on_location = /+branch-id/590782
[08:07] <vila>   parent_location = ../../../+branch/dbusmenu/
[08:08] <didrocks> the project was renamed
[08:08] <vila> that parent_location is really weird...
[08:08] <didrocks> from dbusmenu to libdbusmenu
[08:08] <didrocks> and I guess when renaming a project, trunk branch naming follows but not the configuration
[08:08] <vila> but shouldn't really matter in fact
[08:08] <didrocks> vila: there should be no parent location for lp:libdbusmenu, it's the real trunk
[08:09] <mmrazik> I start to recall an issue with the rename. Trying to recall what additional bzr command we were running
[08:09] <vila> yeah, I don't think it's ever used
[08:09] <vila> anyway, can you run reconcile on that lp branch ?
[08:10] <vila> if :parent doesn't work, use the lp url instead
[08:10] <mmrazik> will do
[08:12] <mmrazik> vila: bzr: ERROR: RemoteRepository(bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/%2Bbranch/libdbusmenu/.bzr/) cannot canonicalize CHKs.
[08:13] <mmrazik> btw. what we have done in CPH had something to do with unstacking but I can't figure out the exact command
[08:14] <vila> CPH ?
[08:14] <mmrazik> vila: copenhagen
[08:14] <mmrazik> I believe we did the renaming there
[08:15] <mmrazik> but then checkout of the trunk didn't work due to some stacking errors
[08:15] <mmrazik> and somebody (I believe from the launchpad team) helped us with that
[08:15] <vila> right, I was about to say that lp guys may have better access...
[08:16] <mgrandi> that error seems really vague..
[08:16] <didrocks> bzr reconfigure --unstacked
[08:16] <didrocks> ?
[08:16] <mgrandi> is there no more descriptive error?
[08:16] <mmrazik> didrocks: yep... thats the one we were using
[08:16] <didrocks> mmrazik: maybe try this on lp:libdbusmenu ?
[08:16] <mmrazik> didrocks: thats what we did
[08:17] <didrocks> mgrandi: I guess that's what bzr is giving :/
[08:17] <mgrandi> is there a stack trace?
[08:17] <mgrandi> either in the output or in bzrlog
[08:17] <mmrazik> mgrandi: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1512096/
[08:18] <mgrandi> i meant for one that says "cannot canonicalize chks"
[08:18] <vila> so lp:libdbusmenu is stacked on lp:libdbusmenu/12.10 indeed so the error may be there for all we know
[08:19] <vila> bah and that one is stacked on lp:dbusmenu/0.6 ...
[08:19] <vila> and finally stacked on 0.5
[08:20] <mgrandi> russian dolls, bzr style
[08:20] <mgrandi> well having a stack trace
[08:20] <mgrandi> for that 'cannot canonicalize' would help...
[08:20] <mmrazik> btw. I just did the reconfigure and I can checkout lp:libdbusmenu now
[08:20] <mmrazik> but bzr info -v still gives errors
[08:20] <vila> mgrandi: grep shows only one call site
[08:21] <vila> bzr checkout lp:libdbusmenu/12.10 succeeds
[08:21] <didrocks> mmrazik: confirms about checkouting working now
[08:22] <vila> having trunk stacked on another branch... is kind of wrong, you generally want trunk's repo to contain most of the history
[08:22] <didrocks> vila: I think that the indicator team is normally doing at the end of a release, something like:
[08:23] <didrocks> bzr branch lp:libdbusmenu
[08:23] <didrocks> bzr push lp:~…/libdbusmenu/13.10
[08:23] <didrocks> and then, set lp:libdbusmenu to …/libdbusmenu/13.10
[08:23] <didrocks> so that's why we have branches stacked an previous releases I guess
[08:24] <vila> I probably miss why you need such a workflow...
[08:24] <didrocks> vila: I don't know why they are doing that, but it seems to be there one :)
[08:25] <vila> but that's not the best way to use stacked branches
[08:25] <didrocks> I think they don't know (and arguagly, they shouldn't have to know) about stacking
[08:25] <didrocks> arguably*
[08:25] <vila> anyway, you're unblocked right ?
[08:25] <mmrazik> vila, didrocks: yes
[08:26] <didrocks> vila: I think, yeah :)
[08:26] <vila> ok, cool
[08:26] <didrocks> thanks vila, mgrandi!
[08:26] <didrocks> I'll try to have them changing their workflow :)
[08:26] <didrocks> mmrazik: btw, it's part of the things we should write on a wiki, like process to create a new release
[08:26] <vila> didrocks: sounds like a good idea
[08:26] <didrocks> mmrazik: because the unity team is doing one way, the indicator team is doing another…
[08:27] <mgrandi> haha, not sure i did anything but ok
[08:27] <vila> but that "canoot canonicalize" error is worth a bug report, it sounds like something really weird is going on there
[08:28] <didrocks> vila: ok, we'll open one with those info, hoping that we can recreate it :)
[08:28] <vila> mgrandi: well, you pointed out that the error message was weird and that's often the way to detect bugs ;)
[08:28] <mgrandi> yeah
[08:28] <mgrandi> why i try to always give as much info in error messages, vague stuff hurts to look at =(
[08:29] <mgrandi> almost worse then microsoft saying "error code 21124124XABB"
[08:31] <vila> here, the message is triggered by an attribute check on the repo object, so probably something jelmer did for foreign repos except we are dealing with a bzr repo here... so I'm a bit lost
[08:31] <mgrandi> i noticed that it was saying osmething about sha1:blahblah
[08:31] <mgrandi> those are for git right?
[08:32] <jelmer> vila: it's not necessarily something to do with foreign repos
[08:32] <jelmer> vila: just that we happened to have a known bug in bzr-svn that was related to this
[08:33] <vila> jelmer: that was just a feeling ;) A bzr repo object missing a bzr method...
[08:33] <vila> some borked inheritance path ?
[08:38] <jelmer> vila: possibly
