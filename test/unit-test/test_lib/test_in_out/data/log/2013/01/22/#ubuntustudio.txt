[01:04] <holstein> cheezhead: what are you trying to do?
[01:05] <holstein> !grub
[01:05] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[01:05] <holstein> ^^ thats what i would follow to recover grub

[10:42] <ChristianSacks> Hi Just installing Ubuntustudio 12.10 within an Oracle VirtualBox, evryhting is running smoothly yet the interface seems really slow!!! What settings should I use to make it operate at normal speed? Im running on an i5 processor, i've set 1024mb ram and only 1 processor. any ideas???
[10:43] <ChristianSacks> I appreciate that perhaps this should be focussed to an Oracle forum?? But maybe someone here can help???
[10:50] <zequence> ChristianSacks_: Make sure there's enough memory for graphics too
[10:50] <zequence> Otherwise, using VB for audio is not recommended, as the performance of course is not going to be great
[10:54] <ChristianSacks_> I've given the graphics 128mb I think... will check now
[10:54] <ChristianSacks_> thanks btw
[10:55] <ChristianSacks_> Ah, oops, only 64mb... that'll not be helping right?
[10:56] <zequence> 64MB is still pretty ok, but I don't know how much Ubuntu Studio actually requires to run its desktop
[10:59] <ChristianSacks_> ok, I will wait till the install has finished and push the gfx up to 128mb and see if it helps... if not, what else should I look for??
[13:31] <ChristianSacks_> hi zequence, I pushed the gfx memory up to 128mb but it's still pretty slow... must be something to do with Oracle VB?? Or is there something else I could try?
[13:54] <Synapse_> hello :-)
[13:56] <Synapse_> i have a question according the desktop of ubuntu studio... i want the top bar to be like on the unity desktop, i found globalmenu but it isn't designed for the latest version of ubuntu studio. can someone help?
[14:04] <cfhowlett> Synapse_, you can add a DE to ubuntustudio but it probably won't be as integrated as XFCE's is.  Just iinstall and see what you get.
[14:07] <Synapse_> i already installed the unity DE but it's not as i like to have it... i just need the globalmenu in the panel... thats all...
[14:09] <cfhowlett> Synapse_, you may not be able to get just the flavor you want.  and USTudio obviously does NOT run unity well.  Sorry, no more precise answer than that from me...
[14:09] <Synapse_> okey thank you anyway :-) i try to find something :-)
[16:09] <holstein> UnWorldly: i would look at xsynth, whysynth ...ask in #opensourcemusicians ...http://wootangent.net/category/linux/ from my friend [lsd] ... search the repos for "synth"... search google for "linux synth"
[16:09] <holstein> there are plenty of synths, just not really any commercial entity making sure you know about them, or how to install/use them
[21:15] <Otie64> Does anybody know why my ubuntu stduio installation is not finishing?
[21:16] <Otie64> It's been stuck at "Saving installed packages..." for a while now.
