[00:00] <nynex> Hello I need a little help with flash. I broke something...
[00:00] <BillyZane2> where is ~
[00:00] <histo> BillyZane2: unity has a screenshot app that comes withit but I can't remember the name of it
[00:01] <SonikkuAmerica> nynex: We don't support Flash here.
[00:01] <histo> BillyZane2: /home/billyzane2   if that's your ussername
[00:01] <BillyZane2> i typed in scrot and nothing happened
[00:01] <histo> BillyZane2: it took a .png and put it in your /home/username  folder
[00:01] <BillyZane2> ok i found it
[00:01] <histo> BillyZane2: or you can use gnome-screenshot   that's aparently the one that comes with ubuntu
[00:02] <nynex> SonikkuAmerica, Okay, what do you recommend I do? if i show you a pic of the problem can you suggest what to google?
[00:02] <SonikkuAmerica> Maybe
[00:03] <SonikkuAmerica> Unless it's that "confetti" problem in Chrome
[00:03] <BillyZane2> http://tinypic.com/r/307vi3n/6
[00:03] <xj54y> How can I check to see what is utilizing a disk?
[00:03] <histo> !details | nynex
[00:03] <ubottu> nynex: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[00:03] <BillyZane2> http://i45.tinypic.com/307vi3n.png
[00:03] <k1l> xj54y: with lsof
[00:03] <BillyZane2> sorry, 640 res is really bad for productivity
[00:04] <benlangfeld> Hello gents. I'm having a hard time finding out about upstart and restarting services as a user other than root. Obviously if that user can sudo, all is good, but if they can't, is there a way to allow them to restart a specific service?
[00:04] <histo> BillyZane2: yeah you are using the nouveau driver that's why your resolution is messed up
[00:04] <BillyZane2> histo: i love you
[00:04] <BillyZane2> histo: how do i fix it?
[00:04] <histo> BillyZane2: click on the one below that and click enable it
[00:05] <BillyZane2> changes are being applied
[00:05] <histo> BillyZane2: enable button is in the bottom right you'd have to move the window up some more to see it.
[00:05] <BillyZane2> i'm going to microwave some food real fast, brb
[00:05] <BillyZane2> histo, i'm hungry, i got school in a few minutes.. like.. ahh.. 40 minutes.. i better get cracking, then i'll get all this done and be on time
[00:06] <SonikkuAmerica> Does anyone know which version of Ubuntu that is that BillyZane2 is using?
[00:06] <BillyZane2> histo, it's going to take a few minutes to apply, i'm using 12.10
[00:06] <nynex> ubottu, Sure. im running 12.04 it was all working fine, but slow on a dell 1520 inspiron so i thought i would install a ligher window environment and put in sudo apt-get install lubuntu as the canonical website suggested.
[00:06] <ubottu> nynex: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[00:06] <BillyZane2> SonikkuAmerica, : 12.10 sir
[00:06] <SonikkuAmerica> nynex: You mean lubuntu-desktop
[00:06] <nynex> SonikkuAmerica, Yeah it looks like confetti
[00:06] <BillyZane2> histo: i will be right back
[00:07] <nynex> SonikkuAmerica, Yeah thats it
[00:07] <SonikkuAmerica> BillyZane2: That's right, you said Xubuntu 12.10.
[00:07] <histo> benlangfeld: you need to edit the sudoers file
[00:07] <SonikkuAmerica> nynex: Sadly, AFAIK there is no fix to that
[00:07] <histo> !sudo | benlangfeld
[00:07] <ubottu> benlangfeld: sudo is a command to run command-line programs with superuser privileges ("root") (also see !cli). Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo for more information. For graphical applications see !gksu (GNOME, Xfce), or !kdesudo (KDE). If you're unable to execute commands with sudo see: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/fixsudo
[00:08] <SonikkuAmerica> nynex: I would suggest using Opera to view YouTube videos for the time being, until the next Pepper Flash comes arounds.
[00:08] <SonikkuAmerica> *around
[00:08] <histo> SonikkuAmerica: what is this confetti bug you speak of?
[00:08] <nynex> SonikkuAmerica, jsut so we are talking about the same thing, is this it? [IMG]http://i46.tinypic.com/2u63db9.jpg[/IMG]
[00:08] <histo> SonikkuAmerica: flash for linux is done I believe
[00:08] <benlangfeld> histo: I know I can edit sudoers, but is there not a way to do it without giving the user sudo?
[00:08] <histo> benlangfeld: yes you can give them permission to a single command etc...
[00:09] <histo> benlangfeld: if you look at that documentation
[00:09] <nynex> histo, by done you mean finished as in its killled or done as in its ready?
[00:09] <jerrad> hey
[00:09] <jerrad> can you guys think of a reason why a file system would suddenly change to read-only?
[00:09] <histo> benlangfeld: ewww they don't ahve it on thos epages let me look for better docs
[00:09] <SonikkuAmerica> histo: In Chrome for Linux, when you try to play a YouTube video using the latest Flash Player, "confetti" (really random single-color dots) appear in the player window. In the HTML 5 demo, they turn red.
[00:09] <nynex> jerr
[00:10] <histo> SonikkuAmerica: not for me... I thinkk it's only with nvidia cards
[00:10] <nynex> jerrad, i had that when my external hdd died
[00:10] <histo> SonikkuAmerica: can't they use gnash instead of flash and fix the issue
[00:10] <BillyZane2> histo, the driver got updated, should i reboot?
[00:10] <SonikkuAmerica> histo: I'm using Ubuntu under a Mobile Intel GMA965. And Gnash doesn't work.
[00:11] <SonikkuAmerica> jerrad: Another one: You might've dropped sudo by accident
[00:11] <benlangfeld> histo: That's still sodoers. That's not what I'm looking for. Thanks anyway
[00:11] <jerrad> SonikkuAmerica: /dev/disk/by-uuid/89617218-d503-4f18-ab7b-0098bfe1dbdf / ext4 ro,relatime,errors=remount-ro,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0
[00:11] <jrib> benlangfeld: what service is this?  You could let the user use upstart to have his own jobs (this isn't enabled by default in ubuntu)
[00:11] <jerrad> no, thats from /proc/mounts
[00:11] <jerrad> its read only
[00:11] <histo> benlangfeld: okay it is what you are looking for but don't believe me

[00:12] <BillyZane2> hisot: brb, rebooting
[00:12] <BillyZane2> histo
[00:12] <SonikkuAmerica> jerrad: So the entire FS just magically [ chmod 744 ]'ed you.
[00:12] <benlangfeld> histo: I'm telling you I would prefer not to use sudo. I know I can do it that way, I know sudo inside out. But thank you for trying to help anyway.
[00:12] <roasted> Question - when I execute my custom find command which deletes all files and directories older than 3 days, I get a message for each directory indicating "No such file or directory." While on one hand it may not matter, I'm exceptionally curious as to why I'm even getting this message during the execution of the find command???
[00:13] <benlangfeld> jrib: Do you have a doc reference for that? Or a good search term?
[00:13] <jrib> benlangfeld: upstart cookbook
[00:13] <jerrad> SonikkuAmerica: i had a FSCK error pop up on startup, fixed it. I think this might be normal operation as per the 'errors=remount-ro,' in /proc/mounts (which i didn't set, so must be default behavior)
[00:13] <SonikkuAmerica> roasted: Are you cd'd to the directory your script is in?
[00:13] <benlangfeld> jrib: This? http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/#user-job
[00:14] <roasted> SonikkuAmerica: there is no script, I'm just running the command freely in terminal.
[00:14] <jrib> benlangfeld: yes
[00:14] <benlangfeld> jrib: Awesome, thanks, will dig into that.
[00:14] <roasted> SonikkuAmerica: I am CD'd into the parent dir though, hang on let me try again.
[00:15] <roasted> SonikkuAmerica: my command is find /home/jason/Desktop/test/* -mmin +1 -exec rm -r {} \;
[00:15] <jrib> benlangfeld: it's not clear what you are doing.  histo's suggestion is what you would want if you just want to let a user manager some service on the system.  But if you want a user to have his own jobs then use user jobs
[00:15] <SonikkuAmerica> jerrad: What is /dev/disk/by-uuid/89617218-d503-4f18-ab7b-0098bfe1dbdf / ext4 ro,relatime,errors=remount-ro,user_xattr,barrier=1,data=ordered 0 0 listed as in Nautilus or your FM?
[00:15] <roasted> SonikkuAmerica: I was CD'd into /home/jason/Desktop/test at the time
[00:15] <histo> benlangfeld: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/allow-a-normal-user-to-run-commands-as-root.html  This will give you an idea.  Then you can remove the passwd prompt etc...
[00:15] <roasted> SonikkuAmerica: still gives me that message even if I'm just CD'd into Desktop
[00:15] <benlangfeld> jrib: I want a user to be able to manage his own jobs.
[00:15] <benlangfeld> histo: Yes, I'm familiar, thank you.
[00:15] <jrib> benlangfeld: k
[00:15] <jerrad> SonikkuAmerica: i dont know how to check that?
[00:15] <SonikkuAmerica> jerrad: Open your file manager

[00:18] <JonEdney> The only change to the file I made was adding a couple aliases, but then I got rid of them thinking I messed things up, and they came back.
[00:18] <jrib> JonEdney: pastebin your ~/.bashrc
[00:18] <benlangfeld> OerHeks: It's a partial solution, but does not do what I want. Sudoers is not a good way to solve the problem I have. Thanks anyway :)
[00:20] <histo> roasted: do the directories hav file in them perhaps you need -f
=== c_smith_afk is now known as c_smith
[00:20] <roasted> histo: yeah, they do have files. I thought I got the same thing with f as well but let me try
[00:21] <roasted> histo: still getting the message.
[00:21] <histo> roasted: what message were you getting?
[00:21] <roasted> histo: I don't understand why it's telling me no such file or dir when the intention is to delete it anyway. It's as if it's looping twice or something
[00:21] <hilarious> anyone ever set up their own SMTP server ?
[00:21] <roasted> histo: sec
[00:21] <roasted> histo: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1567643/
[00:22] <histo> roasted: try find /home/jason/Desktop/test/.  blah lbah
[00:23] <roasted> histo: pardon? just change the * to .?
[00:23] <histo> roasted: yes
[00:23] <roasted> histo: would . still act as a wildcard? The goal is to delete anything older than 3 days in this specific dir.
[00:23] <jrib> hilarious: best to just ask your actual question.  There's some documentation on help.ubuntu.com (server guide) as well as help.ubuntu.com/community about setting up a mail server
[00:24] <JonEdney> jrib, http://pastebin.com/PNnhW89R
[00:24] <hilarious> hm i think i may just use a perl implementation
[00:24] <roasted> histo: same error with .
[00:24] <hilarious> i don't have a specific question, i am thinking about running my own smtp server
[00:24] <JonEdney> jrib, SInce I removed my aliases, this should be a non-altered file, as I'd have no need to touch it.
[00:24] <histo> roasted: yes you are telling it to look there and look by dates i'm assuming
[00:24] <hilarious> seems complicated though
[00:24] <jrib> JonEdney: erm, there is no line 116 :x
[00:24] <roasted> histo: yeah.
[00:25] <roasted> histo: this is for video surveillance. I need to rotate the feeds since I don't have 4 million petabytes of HDD storage
[00:25] <yeats> !smtp | hilarious
[00:25] <ubottu> hilarious: Ubuntu supports the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and provides mail server software of many kinds. You can install a basic email handling configuration with the "Mail server" task during installation, or with the "tasksel" command. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MailServer and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/email-services.html
[00:25] <roasted> histo: this is a mock test for my actual server.
[00:25] <jrib> JonEdney: look at line 103
[00:25] <histo> roasted: Well does it work with .
[00:25] <hilarious> thanks
[00:25] <roasted> histo: no, same error.
[00:25] <roasted> histo: operates identically
[00:25] <JonEdney> jrib, oh my...a rogue paste!
[00:26] <histo> roasted: ask in ##linux again. See if xeon will answer he is good with that sort of thing
[00:26] <JonEdney> I can't believe I overlooked that :( ty jrib
[00:26] <histo> roasted: show him the pastebin also
[00:26] <jrib> roasted: you're deleting based on modification time?
[00:26] <jrib> I feel like I've seen this question in here like 5 times at this point....
[00:27] <roasted> jrib: originally I was deleting based on file type, but that of course leaves empty directories behind.
[00:27] <roasted> jrib: this time I'm axing the whole dir as well.
[00:27] <sid|laptop> rm -rf /
[00:27] <sid|laptop> woops
[00:27] <roasted> no
[00:27] <sid|laptop> wrong window
[00:27] <roasted> very nice
[00:27] <jrib> sid|laptop: well remember to read the man page when that doesn't work I suppose
[00:28] <sid|laptop> thanks ◕‿◕
[00:29] <jrib> roasted: have it echo what it is deleting.  You're probably deleting things recursively from the top and that's messing with find
[00:30] <BillyZane2> histo: it won't work. i tried the one you told me to use, i tried the other drivers. i even did sudo nvidia-xconfig before each reboot
[00:31] <roasted> jrib: I'm drawing a blank as to how I'd incorporate echo in that...
[00:31] <jrib> roasted: change '-exec' to '-print -exec' then

[00:32] <tertulero> espñol
[00:33] <tertulero> español
[00:33] <jrib> roasted: this doesn't have rm :)  Anyway, there's some switch you can pass to find so that it starts at the bottom level which will probably let you avoid the issue you are coming across now
[00:34] <roasted> jrib: ah, thank you - yes there is. I'll dig it up and give that a shot.
[00:34] <jrib> roasted: -depth it seems
[00:34] <histo> jrib: is roasted problem maybe due to the spaces in the results?
[00:34] <roasted> no
[00:34] <roasted> histo: I tried solid single word directories too
[00:35] <roasted> find: `/home/jason/Desktop/test/test1': No such file or directory
[00:35] <histo> roasted: and test1 exists right?
[00:35] <roasted> histo: oh yes
[00:35] <jrib> histo: I don't think so; I believe it's because test1 gets deleted (because he used rm -rf on something above it) and find still goes to look for it
[00:35] <roasted> histo: test1, test2, and four "Untitled Folders" - all 6 got the same error.
[00:36] <histo> roasted: what's your latest paste?
[00:36] <jrib> roasted: -delete might be a better idea too (it includes -depth automatically as a bonus)
[00:36] <BillyZane2> OMG i have sound on ubuntu, but no video. how ironic
[00:36] <roasted> histo: hang on... -depth gave me an error
[00:36] <roasted> but I think I just misplaced -depth
[00:36] <histo> BillyZane2: Can yo ujust use VGA again? does that fix the issue?
[00:37] <BillyZane2> histo: the original driver? i can try
[00:37] <roasted> find: warning: you have specified the -depth option after a non-option argument -mmin blah blah blah etc etc
[00:37] <BillyZane2> histo: i'm in the middle of an update and i gotta leave in a few minutes, but lets try
[00:37] <histo> BillyZane2: No you said this started when you switched to DVI right? can you switch back?
[00:38] <Mkop> well, after struggling to install hebrew in lubuntu, I rebooted, and now everything is right to left
[00:38] <BillyZane2> histo: i am currently on VGA.  this problem was occuring in windows as well. It might be a problem with the video card's bios
[00:38] <johnjacobjinger> BillyZane2 what do u mean u dont have video?
[00:38] <Vivekananda> Hello everyone. I am thinking of upgrading from lucid to 12.04 now but I have just a few questions
[00:38] <BillyZane2> histo: here's the thing, VGA works fine in windows. it detects the high res, but ever since i tried switching to DVI, nothing works in ubuntu, not DVI or VGA
[00:38] <histo> BillyZane2: that's bizare I'd assume it's more related to driver but it could be somehting goofy with the card or the monitors EDID data.
[00:38] <BillyZane2> i mean my screen resolution is stuck at 640x480, i'm back in the stone ages
[00:39] <jrib> roasted: -delete is probably safer too since it won't wipe out directories that are not empty
[00:39] <BillyZane2> hmm.. how do i check EDID data?
[00:39] <histo> BillyZane2: So you activated the nvidia driver rigth?
[00:39] <Immatix> Does anyone know if Precise is ever going to receive dnsmasq 2.6+ ?
[00:39] <Vivekananda> 1. my laptop is old and I heard that 12 needs a little more powerful processor ( celeron is mine ) so should I upgrade. If I do how do I choose to keep it light ? Is gnome still as light?
[00:39] <histo> BillyZane2: did you confirm that it's active in jockey-gtk  ???
[00:39] <BillyZane2> histo: before doing the VGA to DVI swam, I tested this monitor with a DVI cable on another computer, everything worked normally.
[00:40] <roasted> histo: jrib: the money shot - http://paste.ubuntu.com/1567676/
[00:40] <BillyZane2> histo: i did a system update :( it's installing currently
[00:40] <roasted> jrib: I'll give -delete a test drive
[00:40] <DrManhattan> I'd be happy to see firestarter get a friggin DMZ mode. Who makes a firewall tool with no DMZ
[00:40] <BillyZane2> histo, NO I DID NOT, hwo do i do that?
[00:40] <BillyZane2> actually.. you mean the jockey drivers?
[00:41] <histo> roasted: you may want to use the -delete option of find
[00:41] <BillyZane2> i have to say something else.. my computer is running very slow. this is extremely strange as i have an intel i7 3770k. it shouldn't run 1/10th this slow
[00:41] <histo> BillyZane2: No remember I wanted you to enable the nvidia driver in hard ware drivers dialog?
[00:41] <BillyZane2> yup
[00:42] <histo> BillyZane2: then did you go back in hardware drivers and make sure it's enabled?

[00:42] <BillyZane2> these drivers were working before i did the DVI switch too

[00:46] <roasted> here's the paste with -delete: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1567685/
[00:47] <BillyZane2> histo: looks like that might be the problem
[00:47] <jrib> roasted: you're doing -delete before -mmin and you still have -exec....
[00:47] <histo> BillyZane2: What all did you do before to get higher resolution?
[00:47] <jrib> roasted: -delete actually deletes
[00:48] <roasted> oh, I didn't realize -delete was to replace -exec
[00:48] <BillyZane2> histo: all i had to do was install the display drivers before and do nvidia-xconfig
[00:48] <BillyZane2> histo: except there were some complications
[00:48] <Vivekananda> jrib: hey you gave me instructions about the upgrade. Could I have them again from ubotto
[00:48] <BillyZane2> however, it was working before very well
[00:48] <histo> BillyZane2: Yeah what complications?
[00:48] <roasted> jrib: look better? jason@Area51:~/Desktop$ find /home/jason/Desktop/test/* -mmin +1 -delete {} \;

[00:49] <jrib> roasted: you don't need « {} \; »
[00:49] <BillyZane2> i'm not entirely sure, all i know is as soon as i did nvidia-xconfig , everything was fixed. but now that doesn't work anymore
[00:49] <roasted> jrib: look better? jason@Area51:~/Desktop$ find /home/jason/Desktop/test/* -mmin +1 -delete
[00:49] <Vivekananda> also care to comment on the upgrade. should I upgrade or remain with this one for  a less powerful comp
[00:49] <jrib> roasted: seems ok
[00:49] <BillyZane2> histo: before, i was getting very strange results, i mean.. my resolution was jacked up, i couldn't access my entire desktop so using my PC was difficult outside of terminal. this happened when installing nvidia-current
[00:50] <roasted> jrib: winner!
[00:50] <roasted> jrib: I assume that command doesn't work recursively at all? Does it simply look at the dirs within test and that's it?
[00:50] <jrib> roasted: find is recursive the -delete isn't
[00:50] <ajacom> Hi guys ... I installed Samba to attempt to access a Win8 PC. Upon trying to access it, I apparently mistyped the login name (or the domain ... got a little confused there). And now just double-clicking on the remote PC icon (in Browse Network), brings up an error inmediately... Thus Samba remembered my choice. How can I reset that and make Samba forget the pwd I entered? Thanks ...
[00:51] <jrib> roasted: just put a -print before -delete if you are unsure of the behavior
[00:51] <histo> BillyZane2: can you sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup   and try to restart.  If X breaks just sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[00:51] <roasted> jrib: if find is recursive... but delete isn't... would find "win" since it's capable of more?
[00:51] <BillyZane2> sure
[00:51] <jrib> roasted: I guess that's one way of looking at it
[00:52] <roasted> ajacom: I think that would actually be handled on the Windows side. I remember in XP there was a way somewhere deep in control panel to remove saved info.
[00:52] <ajacom> Wow really ?
[00:52] <roasted> ajacom: yeah.
[00:52] <ajacom> Hmm ok ..
[00:52] <roasted> ajacom: I don't think the server plays a role here at all. I'd bet my car if you used a Windows server instead of Samba you'd have the same issue.
[00:52] <BillyZane2> mv: missing destination file operand after `/etc/x11/xorg.conf'
[00:53] <roasted> pending you don't have a domain and identical credentials on the windows server, because then it would auto authenticate etc.
[00:53] <BillyZane2> hmm... one sec, lowercase x
[00:53] <histo> ajacom: edit the /etc/samba/smb.conf
[00:53] <roasted> jrib: if find is recursive, why would it not cause -delete to function outside of the test/* ??
[00:53] <BillyZane2> histo: mv: missing destination file operand after `/etc/X11/xorg.conf'
[00:53] <ajacom> roasted: just for the record... when your windows8 username is xxxx@live.cl ... you shouldn't put "xxxx" in username, and "live.cl" in domain, right? (that's what i did)
[00:53] <jrib> roasted: what do you mean by "outside"?  you mean above it?
[00:54] <histo> BillyZane2: okay does cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf   display any output?
[00:54] <roasted> ajacom: I'm not entirely certain, but my educated *guess* would say that doesn't sound wrong... so sure?
[00:54] <roasted> jrib: yes
[00:54] <roasted> unless find is only recursive one way
[00:54] <jrib> roasted: yes, only one way
[00:54] <BillyZane2> histo: cat: /etx/X11/xorg.conf: No such file or directory
[00:55] <roasted> jrib: so it hits test and stops since that's the parent dir that was targeted in the command. Eh? That train of thought right?
[00:55] <BillyZane2> histo, i gotta leave for class in about 5 minutes
[00:55] <ajacom> histo: smb.conf seems to be holding the samba server configuration actually... nothing on the "Browse Network" part.... (Is that even controlled by Samba ? Or did it came with Ubuntu?)
[00:55] <jrib> roasted: just run "find" by itself and you will see every file it considers
[00:55] <histo> BillyZane2: I have no idea what is causing your issue. If you are running the nvidia driver IDK why you can't set a higher resolution. I'm assuming Xorg is having issues detecting your monitors capabilites. BUt I don't know why this would have worked before but would be failing now. Perhaps someone else can chime in.
[00:55] <jrib> roasted: or "find PATH" in this case
[00:56] <BillyZane2> histo: it's ok. thank you for trying
[00:56] <histo> ajacom: oh sorry. Got confused there. WHen did you get prompted for a password?
[00:56] <BillyZane2> histo: i think i'm going to try to get the video card's bios to be upgraded. i'll check to see if maybe i broke something inside the video card's display adaptor. that is unlikely though. i' gotta go now. thank you so much
[00:56] <roasted> jrib: thereby suggesting, what it displays, is what gets hit with whatever command issued - in this case, -delete. Eh?
[00:57] <ajacom> OK .. Something happened. =)... The password prompt magically reappared
[00:57] <jrib> roasted: no, because you didn't tell it the "-mmin"
[00:57] <ajacom> histo: I'm just trying to access my Win8 PC on the Browse Network part
=== atrius is now known as atrius_away
[00:57] <ajacom> Got very confused with the username/domain/password, since Win8 usernames are username@live.cl or similar...
[00:57] <roasted> jrib: assuming all files older than 1 minute, and I run -mmin +1, THEN what I'm seeing here would be hit with whatever command issued... in this case -delete. Eh?
[00:58] <roasted> ajacom: the domain when authenticating against hte Samba server would be whatever it is in the smb.conf
[00:58] <roasted> ajacom: I didn't understand what you were asking at first.
=== ch3rn0byl is now known as johnjacobjinger
[00:58] <roasted> ajacom: I believe smb.conf defaults to WORKGROUP
[00:58] <johnjacobjinger> i think i want to start a Linux for Car project

=== ke5pcv-away is now known as ke5pcv
[00:58] <roasted> ajacom: from the smb.conf of my machine - # Change this to the workgroup/NT-domain name your Samba server will part of workgroup = WORKGROUP
[00:59] <ajacom> roasted: Yes, I have that set to "Casa", which is my home network's name.
[00:59] <johnjacobjinger> make an in-dash ubuntu machine with touch interface that offers GPS capabilities, audio, rear camera, and maybe a way to record everything your car does to act as a blackbox
[00:59] <ajacom> roasted: I have no problem entering Ubuntu from Windows8 though ...
[00:59] <jrib> roasted: yes.  Remember, find just evaluates expressions.  When you write "find -foo -bar" you should think of it as "find -foo -and -bar".  Find tries to find the value of the expression "-foo AND -bar".  If -foo is false, then it stops and never gets to -bar because it implies "-foo AND -bar" is false.  As long, as each expression is true though, find keeps chugging along.  Some expressions have side
[00:59] <jrib> effects (like -delete which deletes files)
[01:00] <Vivekananda> jrib: about the upgrade. Is 12.04 heavy ? and also advisable to upgrade now ( bug situations and all )
=== kyle_ is now known as Guest78932
[01:01] <roasted> jrib: I understand. My only (and major) concern about this was making sure that it didn't go backwards. Last thing I want is to do find /home/jason/Desktop/test/* -mmin +1 -delete and it goes to test, then Desktop, then jason, etc.
[01:01] <jrib> Vivekananda: 12.04 has been out since april of last year.  So if you read the release notes, you shouldn't expect anything surprising (well when do you anyway? :P).  unity is probably a little more resource intensive than what you are coming from in gnome, but you can use unity-2d (just choose it at the login screen)
[01:02] <Vivekananda> jrib: I like to havee compiz like effects sometimes like desktop jump and I was using devilspie but not sure if that would work now or not
[01:02] <johnjacobjinger> gnome classic for me
[01:02] <ajacom> No avail... I just can't open the machine from here ...
[01:02] <ajacom> No biggie
[01:02] <johnjacobjinger> i cant stand unity
[01:02] <johnjacobjinger> gah
[01:02] <roasted> johnjacobjinger: give it time.
[01:02] <jrib> Vivekananda: how much ram do you have?
[01:02] <Vivekananda> 2 gig
[01:02] <roasted> johnjacobjinger: I was a one time hater, now I feel lost without it.
[01:02] <johnjacobjinger> roasted it doesnt play nicely with my media center
[01:03] <Vivekananda> celeron 1.6 ghz max
[01:03] <roasted> johnjacobjinger: how so?
[01:03] <Vivekananda> lower is 800 mhz
[01:03] <Vivekananda> for the cpu
[01:03] <johnjacobjinger> like the dock on the side doesnt disappear when i am playing my movies full screen
[01:03] <johnjacobjinger> the panels on top and bottom do just not the stupid dock
[01:03] <johnjacobjinger> using xbmc
[01:03] <dr_willis> johnjacobjinger:  theres known bugs and work arounds for that bug. but i dont see the issue with xbmc here on my  nvidia card.
[01:03] <roasted> johnjacobjinger: I'm running 12.04 with XBM Con my system. Unity bar hides when I laucnh XBMC...
[01:04] <roasted> Nvidia card here
[01:04] <Vivekananda> I have to run intensive tasks on this machine too sometimes ( I know :( ) but what to do . So I want a lightweight but functional manager like gnome
[01:04] <johnjacobjinger> i noticed it on my dell m4600
[01:04] <dr_willis> i even run xbmc on my Raspberrypi
[01:04] <dr_willis> ;)
[01:04] <johnjacobjinger> which has an nvidia 2000m
[01:04] <johnjacobjinger> but not a big deal gnome classic is pretty good imo
[01:05] <jrib> Vivekananda: hmm I don't know how well unity would run.  But if it gives you trouble, you have unity-2d, as well as xubuntu, lubuntu, and even gnome-classic available to you
[01:05] <roasted> dr_willis: I'd PM you but I forget how to do it over irssi. ONE quick question - does the Pi to video AND audio over hdmi?
[01:05] <dr_willis> gnome2 had some issues. ;)  the fallback gnome mode - was slated for removeable.
[01:05] <dr_willis> roasted:  yes. can do HD video over hdmi.

It stays on the ubuntu load screen for several minutes then this error appears.  I know, I'm retarded, but I'd love an answer <3
[01:07] <Vivekananda> jrib: are these option avaialabe for switch out of the box or do I have to download each of these separately ?
[01:08] <jrib> Vivekananda: not sure.  unity-2d and gnome-classic might be.  The others definitely need to be installed after if you want them

[01:10] <w0rm-_x> dr_willis, there is a flag for GUIs for better performance

[01:13] <xsacha_> hi, is there a specific channel for ubuntu phone?
[01:14] <histo> locojay: I don't believe there is one for ubuntu  user
[01:14] <locojay> adding one via passwd
[01:14] <histo> locojay: take a look at /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to be sure
[01:14] <locojay> and then logging in helps
[01:14] <locojay> i m in :)
[01:14] <histo> locojay: Why not just log in without one
[01:15] <locojay> did not work
[01:15] <locojay> no idea why via sshd

[01:20] <steven> aptitude safe-upgrade, aptitude full-upgrade
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest13197
[01:21] <OerHeks> apt-get upgrade
[01:23] <dougl> cant get a straight answer in here - I'll try google.
[01:24] <Guest13197> Alright folks! I've got an incredibly frustrating issue that I'm hoping someone can see through and give me a chance at running Ubuntu on my computer finally. :( I've got a Gigabyte Z77-D3H motherboard and no matter how I install my Windows 7 Pro x64 copy I can't get Ubuntu to recognize that it exists. I've tried using "EFI ROM" and "Legacy ROM" BIOS settings and installing both by using the "UEFI" and the "SATA" options for the drive
[01:24] <aeon-ltd> dougl: those were straight answers
[01:24] <OerHeks> dougl sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade is the usual routine to update
[01:24] <seekwill> Hello. I just installed 12.10, and enabled FDE. When I'm setting up my user, it asks me about encrypting my Home folder. What is the difference between that and FDE?
[01:24] <Shayde> hey guys
[01:25] <dougl> I must be misunderstanding then - apologies.
[01:25] <Guest13197> Will pay for working solution that doesn't involve manually installing a boot loader and 8 conversions of boot partitions ;)
[01:26] <dougl> what does sudo apt-get dist-upgrade do?
[01:26] <Aszurom> doesn't that bring you current to the latest and greatest release?
[01:26] <aeon-ltd> dougl: upgrade the versions of ubuntu
[01:26] <histo> Guest13197: did you install windows first?
[01:27] <Shayde> I'm using wubi to install ubuntu on my windows 7 computer but i keep getting an error when i first select ubuntu from the boot options saying: "error: cannot read '/dev/sda' : Input/output error" followed by a different colored screen with "Invalid ROM contents, no valid vbios image found" then it goes into the ubuntu splash screen that says "checking disk drives for errors"
[01:27] <magpiie> hi
[01:27] <histo> seekwill: it would just encrypt your home directory instead of the whole disk
[01:27] <Aszurom> apt-get upgrade will upgrade packages in the current point release version, but dist-upgrade will bring the whole system to the latest point release -- right?
[01:27] <magpiie> how can i find out if my isp is blocking ports to my connection?
[01:27] <Shayde> that is the error that is stopping me from completing the installation
[01:28] <Guest13197> histo: Sure did. I've got an essentially blank HDD at this point that I'm installing to because I've cleared it trying to get it to work.

[01:28] <zykotick9> Aszurom: dist-upgrade is the same as full-upgrade.  upgrade everything.
[01:28] <aeon-ltd> dougl: oh wait that's a lie. it removes obslete packages and adds dependencies
[01:28] <aeon-ltd> dougl: 'do-release-upgrade' upgrades distributions
[01:28] <Aszurom> yeah, I was asking in assisting the other guy who had asked it.  That's my "I think this is the answer" reply
[01:29] <magpiie> i can access the internet, but i cannot use utorrent or teamspeak or connect to the battlestar gallactica online game. something is blocking my ports
[01:29] <histo> Guest13197: it's pretty straight forward. Install Windows... Leave free space for ubuntu. then install ubuntu it will see that windows is there when it installs grub. I would avoid EFI since you have that ability. Making it easier on yourself.
[01:29] <aeon-ltd> magpiie: check your firewall
[01:29] <locojay> hi i have a Marvel Raid -Chip 88SE9230 and running under livecd.. i can see it in lscpi on pci port 4 . but the drive is not mounted ? do i have to use dmraid?
[01:29] <MattDNJ> I have ubuntu installed on several machines but when I try to install on a Dell Inspiron 560 64 bit dual core E5800 Pentium, the install media freezes and never completes the boot process.   Is there a way that I can modify the install on my thumb drive to be able to step through the install and identify the specific issue?
[01:29] <histo> magpiie: Did you install a firewall?
[01:30] <magpiie> it was working fine erlier today, then my pc stopped connecting to certain sites, as well as my laptop and my friends pc in his room

[01:30] <ubottu> MattDNJ, please see my private message

[01:31] <histo> magpiie: then It's your router or isp
[01:31] <Guest13197> histo: Sounds simple enough, right? The problem is I've attempted to but it won't allow me. The "ubuntu will see that windows is there"
[01:31] <Guest13197> part doesn't happen
[01:31] <histo> Guest13197: then you can manually add the windows entry to grub

[01:32] <Guest13197> No matter that method/mode I install Windows in and then boot to ubuntu with (EFI/Legacy ROM) Ubuntu doesn't recognize that Win7 is on the HDD.
[01:32] <magpiie> how can i find out if my isp is blocking ports?

=== super is now known as Guest22378
[01:33] <Guest13197> histo: I see. So Install Win7 in "Legacy ROM" mode, then boot to Ubuntu LiveCD. Install on empty partitoin space, and then manuall add Win7 to GRUB2?
[01:33] <Guest13197> histo: Yep
[01:33] <histo> magpiie: if it was working earlier I'm willing to bet one of your routers is just acting wacky right now.
[01:33] <histo> Guest13197: yeah if during the install process grub doesn't find windows you'd have to manually add it.  Make sure you install grub to the MBR
[01:34] <histo> Guest13197: perhaps you may want to read the uefi stuff as well. Just incase that's what is going on.
[01:34] <histo> !uefi | Guest13197

[01:36] <MattDNJ> histo, I think I have tried that.  I tried 32bit, a variety of settings, different versions, etc.   Fedora also dies the same way.   There must be a hardware issue.
[01:37] <histo> MattDNJ: have you checked your media?
[01:38] <MattDNJ> Yes.   After it failed on that machine I successfully installed on another.  I ran through the check too.  I've tried several different versions and media.

[01:44] <Gerowen> Next question, let's say this works just fine, and I want to remove all Windows partitions from my hard drive and extend the Ubuntu partitions to take up the remaining space, is there a way to "safely" extend an EXT4 partition so it would take up free space on the drive?

[01:47] <Gerowen> aaamourao: You can use the command "grub-install" to install grub to a particular hard drive.  I haven't used it in a long time, but "grub-install --help" should give you some useful flags to use with it.
[01:48] <Guest23275> Howdy. I've just recently install 12.10 x64 on my laptop. I wanted to install GNOME 3.6 and followed this page to do so: http://akovid.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-install-gnome-36-in-ubuntu1210.html . I restarted with no issue. When I try to log in, I select GNOME (not classic), but it seems to always run GNOME classic.

[01:51] <Gerowen> Shayde: You can use the Ubuntu DVD to install it alongside Windows, during the steps where it partitions your hard drive, there is an option to resize your Windows partition to make room for Ubuntu.
[01:51] <Gerowen> Shayde: I've heard of some people having issues with Wubi on some hardware.
[01:51] <Shayde> i don't have any CDs laying round that are big enough :( Could I use a USB drive?
[01:52] <Gerowen> Shayde: Yep, I used a USB drive.  I did it, there's tons of programs out there to let you format a thumb drive and extract an ISO to it and make it bootable.
[01:52] <Gerowen> It's how I got it on mine because I didn't have any CDs either.
[01:53] <Shayde> Gerowen: any path you can point me to that you suggest? hahaha
[01:54] <Gerowen> Shayde: Lemme get the name of a program for you that works with Windows, I don't remember the name of it.
[01:54] <danielmuu> 哈哈
[01:57] <Gerowen> Shayde: Look at UNetbootin
[01:58] <Shayde> Gerowen: Thank you! I'll give it a try
[01:58] <Gerowen> Shayde: It has a Windows version and has built in options to download ISOs for a lot of Linux distros, or you can select an ISO you have already downloaded.  It does all the formatting for you, hope it works out, :-)

[02:05] <Vivekananda> seekwill: The question was directed at that was for you :)
[02:05] <Vivekananda> ok so if I get flux box then what can I not do it it that I can do in gnome
[02:05] <seekwill> Vivekananda: I would buy a new computer :P
[02:05] <Vivekananda> I like to stick with gnome
[02:05] <seekwill> Why not stick with 10.04?

[02:24] <immortal_> Hello. I just tried to install gnome 3.6 on 12.10. I can only use the gnome classic shell (even if I select "GNOME" at the login screen). Should I try to remove gnome3 completly and try again?
[02:27] <aeon-ltd> immortal_: if you can kill the guis and and managers try starting gnome 3.6 from the terminal
[02:28] <dr_willis> so you used a PPA for gnome 3.6 ?
[02:30] <immortal_> aeon-ltd, Would that just be running gnome-session?
[02:31] <immortal_> dr_willis, I used this: http://akovid.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-install-gnome-36-in-ubuntu1210.html
[02:31] <mechlior> Does anyone know if there are issues with ubuntu connecting to the net if you use wubi to install?
[02:31] <seekwill> mechlior: It's usually better if you stated what your issue is
[02:33] <dr_willis> i cant even read the 'commands' they are showong on that site.. the color scheme is so bad...
[02:33] <dr_willis> mechlior:  wubi has lots of issues.. but the drivers and networking shoul dbe the same as a normal install
[02:33] <mechlior> Im sorry, i installed ubuntu 12.10 via wubi and the network connections find my ethetnet port and show a mac address, but keeps sayin that my wired connection is disconnected.  I reboot back into windows and the internet is running fine.
[02:34] <dr_willis> what kind of wired network card do you have? theres some bugs with some drivers for some of them..
[02:34] <seekwill> mechlior: In Linux, does it show you have an IP address? Or just mac? In Windows, are you using DHCP?
[02:37] <mechlior> Im using an onboard ethernet controller from gigabyte model 900fxa-ud7 and doesnt show an ip anywhere.  The dchp is built into my router, but i cant even get to that in ubuntu
[02:37] <mechlior> Excuse me its 990fxa-ud7
[02:37] <dr_willis> mechlior:  you may want to pastebin the output of ifconfig and lspci
[02:38] <mechlior> Im still kinda new to linux, so do i just type those into the terminal?
=== Guest62995 is now known as nihgt___________
[02:38] <dr_willis> you  have no networking at all on that machine right now?
[02:39] <mechlior> No, i have it plugged in, but i cant reach my router settings via browser
[02:40] <vidd> stupid question here im sure ... what happened to the "ALT" cd?
[02:40] <dr_willis> mechlior:  start with simple command  line tests...     can you  ping your router?    in terminal... ping  ###.###.##.###    Where the ## is the ip of your router
[02:40] <dr_willis> vidd with 12.10 - its gone
[02:41] <dr_willis> mechlior:  second command line test   the output of th e'ifconfig' comand - does it show a eth0 or eth1 device? does it show an ip# for that device.
[02:41] <vidd> dr_willis: will the live cd give the ltsp install option?
[02:41] <dr_willis> vidd no idea. never used lstp.
[02:41] <dr_willis> !lstp
[02:42] <mechlior> Umm, im connected here on my tablet, so is there someting i should look for in ifconfig?
[02:42] <dr_willis> not evcen sure what  lstp is. ;)
[02:42] <mechlior> It shows eth0
[02:42] <dr_willis> the first few lines should mention a eth#   device. then below it.. some numbers.. like an ip#
[02:42] <dr_willis> 192.168.1.100  or similer..
[02:42] <vidd> ltsp = linux terminal server project
[02:43] <mechlior> It shows a inet6 ip address, but no ipv4
[02:43] <dr_willis> hmm.. whats the ipv6 address its showing

[02:45] <bee> I want to learn Ubuntu so should I first learn Debian ?
[02:45] <mechlior> Its not even showing
[02:45] <dr_willis> I dont know enough about ipv6 to know whats supposed to be there
[02:45] <BIGBOOMBA> I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 on a Dell Inspiron 13z that came with Windows 8 pre-installed. I have created a partition for it and used the Universal USB Installer to put the iso onto an 8 gb sd card (that i inserted into the laptop using an adapter). This laptop uses UEFI instead of a BIOS, and the windows bootloader has a .efi extension, so I have to install ubuntu in EFI mode. The problem is that I'm fairly sure that UUI for
[02:46] <BIGBOOMBA> not a GPT.
[02:46] <petersaints> rolling
[02:46] <mechlior> Me either...
[02:46] <dr_willis> bee:  if you know linux fundamentals first.. it wont matter what disrto you use.
[02:46] <bee> Preior I have worked on Fedora and CentOs
[02:46] <Donnie_Darko21> hello folks i have some problems with my google chrome, i have 12.04 lts the problem is video on youtube its like something like smal points small parts are flying on the video
[02:46] <mechlior> Should i try manually adding a ipv4 address?
[02:47] <dr_willis> mechlior:  at least it is showing a eth0   thats a good sign.
[02:47] <dr_willis> you could try the command 'sudo dhclient eth0'   that might  kick it into gettting an ip from your dhcp server
[02:47] <BIGBOOMBA> As it stands, the only way to get the UEFI to try booting from the SD card is to switch it to Legacy Boot mode, and when I start the laptop in that mode with or without the SD card inserted I simply get a black screen and the message, "Operation System not found."
[02:47] <bee> in Fedora I use yum command but in Ubuntu apt is used (if i am correct) so a little confusion
[02:48] <mechlior> Yeah, it atleast sees my controller,
[02:48] <fishcooker> opensync ubuntu 12.04
[02:48] <fishcooker> is removed
[02:48] <fishcooker> there is another candidate

[02:48] <ubottu> bee: APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome), !Muon (KDE) or !Apper (KDE)
[02:48] <fishcooker> ?
[02:49] <BIGBOOMBA> I turned Secure Boot off, but I think I need to set the SD card up to have the image and a GPT, not a MBR. The UUI tool doesn't have an option for this.
[02:49] <dr_willis> mechlior:  i cant understand why there would be ipv6 shown.. but no ipv4.. that just seems weird. My Unplugged  eth0 shows neither.
[02:49] <BIGBOOMBA> Either that, or I'm doing something else wrong.
[02:49] <tomsloan> Hi guys. My home folder is currently limited to about 13 gigs even though the partition it's in is about 115 gigs. Is there any reason for this and how do I expand it to use the whole partition?
[02:49] <eye_> whois eye_
[02:49] <dr_willis> tomsloan:  you  made a seperate home partion? check output of the mount command if not sure.
[02:50] <mechlior> Yeah, ive never had a problem before....
[02:50] <Donnie_Darko21> what is wrong with google chrome ,i usually use firefox more often but in some way now i have problem with youtube video on chrome
[02:50] <RollinV2> tomsloan, you might have a swap file of 2gigs
=== boze is now known as boze_tacoBell
[02:50] <mechlior> Hmm should i get my ip settings from windows and manually set it up?
[02:51] <BIGBOOMBA> It can't be a hardware issue, because the Dell Inspiron 13Z is certified as compatible with Ubuntu. So it's gotta be something with the damn UEFI (which seems to have been invented to make it harder to install linux on PCs that come with windows pre-installed).
[02:52] <tomsloan> RollinV2 is right, more or less. An installation how-to told me to use a Linux swap inbetween my OS X partition (I'm on a MacBook) and my Linux partition of about 1 GB. What now?
[02:52] <dr_willis> mechlior: are yu using dhcp in windows? if not then you will want the same settings
[02:53] <mechlior> I got by manually setting it up, it just wouldnt do it automatically.  Thanks for your time
[02:53] <BIGBOOMBA> right now i'm reading this: http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/index.html
[02:53] <BIGBOOMBA> right track?
[02:53] <RollinV2> tomsloan, how much RAM does your macbook have?
[02:53] <tomsloan> 2 gb
[02:53] <Donnie_Darko21> its really weird why firefox video works fine and chrome youtube video have problem , java is update ,flash update but on chrome YOU USE NOW THE GREAT VERSION OF CHROME  i have problem now
[02:53] <RollinV2> tomsloan, if its less than 4gb id highly recommend keeping the swap file in place
[02:53] <bee> thanks "<ubottu>"  it means that there is no need to learn Debian first to switch into Ubuntu server side ?
[02:53] <fishcooker> is there any option for package opensync
[02:54] <RollinV2> tomsloan, for systems with 4+ gb its safe to not use the swap. but everyones opinion will differ.
[02:54] <dr_willis> bee: they will be 90% the same
[02:55] <dr_willis> bee: learn what you plan on using.
[02:56] <dr_willis> !find opensync
[02:56] <bee> basically i usually use command like in prepairing Fedora server so plz can you guide me more for the command line tutorials so I may configure squid and Samba server on Ubuntu
[02:56] <ubottu> Package/file opensync does not exist in quantal
[02:56] <tomsloan> @RollinV2 Ok, so the swap file limits the size of the Home folder? Is there any way to allow Linux to utilize the whole partition and maintain the file swap?
[02:56] <dr_willis> bee: most of that core stuff will be udentical
[02:57] <Donnie_Darko21> where i can send log file or etc crash report for google chrome
[02:57] <dr_willis> ssh in. edit configs..   basic server admin tasks

[03:00] <dr_willis> tomsloan:  a swap file takes up space. it dosent limit home. except that it uses space on the hd

[03:06] <ryan_> so i was in gnome for the first time today, and i came across an app called "software" and clicked on (highlighted) the stock gnome browser as i wanted to uninstall it. i clicked in the bottom left where it said "delete". as i lifted my finger off the trackpad, i realized that EVERY APP ON MY MACHINE WAS SELECTED by a blue check box. i panicked and immidiatly held down the power button on my laptop turning it off, hoping to kill it
[03:06] <ryan_>  before everything was gone. when i booted back up and logged into gnome and everything was gone. not one single app would show. nothing. so on a whim i logged out and logged into unity and the same thing happened. Whats queer is that when in unity, any app i have docked to the launcher still works without a hitch, making me think everything is still there. if i go to "file system -> usr -> lib" there is still a bunch of stuff in t

[03:12] <ryan_> if you jump to the url i posted to ubuntu forums there are several screenshots of the issue
[03:12] <dr_willis> 'no aps  they are gone;'   you mean the ICONS are gone?  or the applications button shows nothing?
[03:13] <dr_willis> its hard for me to read some sites - since im on my phone
[03:13] <dr_willis> in eithe rcase.. id test with a guest user. then test with a newly made user.

[03:16] <dr_willis> tomsloan:  you can resize partions with Gparted from a live ccd.
[03:16] <dr_willis> tomsloan:  since one is aparently empty.. you could  delete it and enlarge the other perhaps.
[03:17] <dr_willis> tomsloan:  you tell us.. whats on the 100+gb partion thats  aparently close to empty. ;;)
[03:17] <tomsloan> actually, I'm pretty sure it's a screwed up linux-mint partition

[03:28] <trwpqz> it's where my internet explorers come from, as they say
[03:28] <Super_Dog> Might want to check the grade on that one...
[03:29] <ryan_> @dr_willis i cant log in as a guest.... i use the gnome 3.6 login screen and there is no option for it....
[03:30] <Super_Dog> trwpqz:  better get a handle on those Internet Explorers.  they can get pretty feisty...
[03:31] <bee> when we first time install ubuntu in the desktop pc,it does not ask to add root user password as Fedora and Centos ask durning instllation . So how can I use root account instead of normal user ?
[03:31] <ryan_> but anywho, when in unity, i open the dash and it says i have only 18 apps, i actually have over 100, when i click the "pencil and ruler" at the bottom of the dash it shows all 118
[03:31] <hektac> bee: sudo or su

[03:32] <bee> so when we use su "Switch User" it will not ask the password ?

[03:38] <ryan_> nope, but in ubuntu i can either click the sound icon on my top bar, and sound settings is on the bottom, or i can go to the dash and type "sound settings"
[03:38] <trwpqz> _t4nn3r: does your device have an activity led?
[03:38] <Super_Dog> Mkop: Right click on sound icon on upper right corner of taskbar - sound settings.  At least that is the way in Ubuntu.  Not sure if Lubuntu is different.
[03:38] <ryan_> should be in your apps, not to famillar with lubuntu

[03:42] <trwpqz> _t4nn3r: you might get more info from udevadm info -a -p $(udevadm info -q path -n /dev/sdb)
[03:44] <_t4nn3r> trwpqz: A little verbose, but it does the trick
[03:44] <trwpqz> _t4nn3r: or smartctl --all /dev/sdb if you have smartmontools
[03:47] <dr_willis> ryan_:  its hard to tell if its a  gnome shell ppa issue. or your apt  disaster issue.. or whats going on..  id have to suggest backing up any imporntant data firsst. ;) then perhaps try removeing the gnome ppa you are using. and remove the newer gnome-shell stuff.. then try reinstalling the  ubuntu-desktop package. and try  to get back to a known sane state
[03:48] <ryan_> thanks doc. I do a lot of cloud computing, i use google Drive, and i dual boot, and keep all my files backed up in win7....i might just start over :(
[03:49] <dr_willis> a forced powering off while apt is working is never a good idea. ;)
[03:49] <dr_willis> you could just try reinstalling the ubuntu-desltop package also. that might sort things out
[03:49] <ryan_> lol yeah...
[03:49] <ryan_> ok ill try. THANK YOU!

[04:01] <BillyZane2> hey dr_willis
[04:01] <dr_willis> moo!
[04:01] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: how is it going?
[04:01] <BillyZane2> i have a problem. lol
[04:01] <BillyZane2> well... i got sound to work by using my on board sound
[04:01] <BillyZane2> but i have a new problem regarding my video card
[04:01] <BillyZane2> something no one can fathom or fix
[04:02] <BillyZane2> not even MSI tech support
[04:02] <BillyZane2> are you up for it dr_willis  ?
[04:02] <dr_willis> cant say ive ever called tech support in my entire life. ;)
[04:02] <BillyZane2> haha
[04:03] <BillyZane2> ok.. here goes...
[04:03] <dr_willis> i doubt if i can be of any help. I always use older nvidia cards that work fine.
[04:03] <BillyZane2> when we got my video card to work a few days back, i had my video card going from my monitor's VGA port, to a vga cable, to a VGA to DVI converter to my video card's DVI port
[04:04] <BillyZane2> I had this setup because I thought my DVI connector wasn't working a long time ago. I decided though to test it out again to see if it would work
[04:04] <BillyZane2> I took my monitor to a shop where the dude hooked up my monitor to a computer with a DVI cable. everything was good. my screen resolution was as it should be
[04:04] <BillyZane2> I am happy at this point. So i bring back my monitor to my house where I think it's just a simple matter of swapping the VGA cable for a DVI
[04:05] <BillyZane2> this is where the problem begins. When I use DVI in windows, I can only do 1024x768 max resolution
[04:05] <BillyZane2> this problem is also felt in the bios, in the boot up, and in Ubunutu
[04:05] <BillyZane2> I try and try to fix it, nothing works. So now i've switched back to VGA. In windows, my resolution has restored
[04:06] <BillyZane2> however, in Ubuntu, I can't get my resolution past 640x480
[04:06] <BillyZane2> i've tried switching drivers, i've tried nvidia-xconfig
[04:06] <BillyZane2> a helpful hint that might solve the problem is this...
[04:06] <BillyZane2> http://pastebin.com/LsmYUmJv
[04:07] <dr_willis> if dvi in windows is not even giving the proper res. that sounds like the monitor is not reporting the proper res to the system
[04:07] <dr_willis> id test this with a differnt monitor or tv
[04:07] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: That sounds like it's the issue, but this monitor along with this DVI cable was able to work flawlessly on another computer
[04:07] <hektac> what kind of card is it
[04:07] <BillyZane2> hmm... actually.. i might be wrong on that
[04:07] <BillyZane2> it's an nvidia GTX 660
[04:08] <dr_willis> other computer/card/ may have done some assumptions..
[04:08] <hektac> what driver are you using?
[04:08] <BillyZane2> i'm using the 310 drivers i believe.. let me check
[04:08] <dr_willis> id test with a difffernt monitor and see if it does in fact work.. that would  narrow it down to a monitor isssue or not.
[04:08] <hektac> ^
[04:09] <BillyZane2> i'm using nvidia binary xorg driver, kernel module and VDPAU library from nvidia-current-updates(proprietary)
[04:10] <tech936> anyone know the output of this ??  date -u +%V$(uname)|sha256sum|sed 's/\W//g'"?
[04:10] <BillyZane2> i've tried installing alternative driers, 2 others in particular, and i did nvidia-xconfig on both occasions, i rebooted my computer. no result. NOTHING seems to work
[04:10] <BillyZane2> my resolution and video card was working perfectly fine, then suddently when I hot swapped the VGA for true DVI, everything went to garbage
[04:10] <BillyZane2> and nothing works even if i go back to VGA, which is what i'm using now
[04:10] <dr_willis> you can custom make a xorg.conf and try to force various resolutions, or use xrandr. but ive not needed to do that in years
[04:11] <hektac> that really sounds like a monitor issue then
[04:11] <hektac> or the port on your card perhaps
[04:11] <tech936> anyone atall know the output of this??? My ubuntu just flew this on the screen and said whats the output
[04:11] <BillyZane2> i think i ran xrandr earlier, what does that do again?
[04:11] <dr_willis> ive  seen hot swapomg video cables cause shorts/issues.. and if its an old card. that may have finally been the  little kick it needed
[04:11] <BillyZane2> hektac: it does. but this monitor on this setting works fine on windows
[04:11] <dr_willis> !xrandr
[04:11] <ubottu> XRandR 1.2 is the new method of running dual screens in !X.  Information/HowTo here: http://wiki.debian.org/XStrikeForce/HowToRandR12
[04:12] <hektac> its a 660 so its not that old
[04:12] <BillyZane2> i just bought in
[04:12] <dr_willis> xrandr is how you can configure things on the fly
[04:12] <BillyZane2> it
[04:12] <dr_willis> a new card witha  vga port and not a hdmi? that is odd.
[04:12] <BillyZane2> let me run xrandr real fast
[04:12] <BillyZane2> dr_willis, : i'm using a VGA to DVI converter
[04:12] <dr_willis> xrandr has all sorts of cli options to force specific res;s
[04:12] <BillyZane2> it's going through DVI, but it's connected to a VGA cable
[04:12] <dr_willis> vga to dvi converter can cause issues also
[04:13] <cub> is there a way to easily show the desktop on ubuntu 12.04?
[04:13] <hektac> do you have the option of using HDMI?
[04:13] <cub> like minimize all windows?
[04:13] <BillyZane2> hektac: i do not
[04:14] <hektac> billy- I had a similar issue with my 570, I had to set grub to load ubuntu with "nomodeset" and I had to instsall the nvidia drivers manually (downloaded from their site), since then no issues and I run off HDMI and dvi
[04:14] <BillyZane2> i don't mind trying that
[04:14] <dr_willis> cub when i alt-tab theres a desktop item there for me.
[04:15] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: should i try xrandr and force the resolution higher?
[04:16] <BillyZane2> i was told it was an EDID issue by someone
[04:16] <BillyZane2> http://pastebin.com/LsmYUmJv
[04:16] <BillyZane2> from that log, it looks like the monitor's EDID information is not being detected, thus the screen resolution
[04:17] <dr_willis> BillyZane2:  no reason to not try.... or go buy a new monitor....
[04:17] <dr_willis> vga-dvi converters can mess with edid info
[04:17] <BillyZane2> i've been using this vga-dvi converter this whole time
[04:18] <BillyZane2> i got my computer to work with a good resolution, using VGA-DVI converter. the way i have it setup now is how it always was. Now suddenly there's no resolution...
[04:18] <BillyZane2> Dr_willis i think i figured it out
[04:18] <BillyZane2> there's a subtle detail
[04:18] <BillyZane2> that i left out
[04:18] <BillyZane2> Before, I was using a 5 foot VGA cable
[04:18] <BillyZane2> it allowed my computer to detect my screen resolution, which is 2048x1152 without any issues
[04:19] <BillyZane2> right now, although I have a high screen resolution in windows, I'm only using 1080p, and when I manually set it to 2024x1152, the quality is severely degraded. this means that the longer VGA cable is interfering with the EDID information
[04:20] <BillyZane2> is this hypothesis plausable?
[04:20] <dr_willis> cant say ive ever seen  a vga monuitor that could do 2048x1152  that seems an odd red.
[04:20] <dr_willis> res.
[04:20] <BillyZane2> could i still manually increase the screen res in xrandr ? if so, how?
[04:20] <dr_willis> i havent used vga in years.. but it can have interfearance
[04:20] <BillyZane2> it is an odd res
[04:21] <dr_willis> check the xrandr docs. it might not work properly wioth the nvidia drivers.
[04:21] <BillyZane2> it's a special res used for working with 2 documents side by side.. 2048x1152 that is
[04:21] <BillyZane2> i have the nvidia drivers installed evidently
[04:21] <dr_willis> so this is a rather rare monitor then.
[04:21] <BillyZane2> i don't mind trying 1920x1080 though
[04:21] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: the resolution is, yes. however, I was working on this res with the 5 foot cable
[04:22] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: I could go to my friend's house and get my 5 foot cable back i suppose, i traded it for a 25ft cable that turned out to be horrendous
[04:22] <BillyZane2> I've been going through a cable ordeal lately
[04:23] <dr_willis> 25 ft for vga would be extreme for vga i would iomagine
[04:23] <BillyZane2> it has horrible ghosting. I'm using a 15 foot cable right now which is the smallest I could find over 6 feet
[04:23]  * dr_willis recalls his large box of differnt cables and stiff.. dont ghink i got any vga over 6 ft long
[04:24] <BillyZane2> But I believe the 15 foot cable might be the issue, the EDID information is being degraded
[04:24] <dr_willis> i do have a 25ft hdmi cable. ;)
[04:24] <BillyZane2> unless of course i'm totally wrong on this and it's impossible for that to occur
[04:24] <BillyZane2> long cables are horrible unless you have a signal booster from what i've read
[04:24] <dr_willis> im not even sure if vga  uses edid info.. been so long siince i last used it
[04:25] <dr_willis> i switched to dvi/hdmi and havent looked back
[04:25] <BillyZane2> lucky u :)
[04:25] <dr_willis> soon to be all hdmi on my systems
[04:25] <hektac> some VGA connectors do, but apparently that isn't standard
[04:25] <BillyZane2> i have a 6 foot DVI cable too... it's so ridiculous that I can't use it
[04:25] <BillyZane2> it's perfect size
[04:26] <BillyZane2> i will try to look up xrandr documents online
[04:27] <Hyperiant> When you make a bootable LiveUSB, isn't the entire file system kept in a single large, compressed file?
[04:28] <BillyZane2> i found a command
[04:28] <Hyperiant> I'm seeing a gigantic filesystem.squashfs file, and there's a casper-rw file for persistence that's 4GB
[04:29] <Hyperiant> If that's the case, then doesn't this cause more lag than a "full" install of Ubuntu, which (I presume) just places files in their respective folders on the drive instead of within a huge file?
[04:31] <dr_willis> the changes are stored to the casper-rw file
[04:31] <dr_willis> and yes. a live install is gong to be slower then a full install
[04:31] <dr_willis> and have other limits
[04:31] <Hyperiant> Is there a way I can put a full bootable install on a USB drive?
[04:31] <dr_willis> You can do a full install to a usb.. same as you would to a internal HD
[04:32] <Hyperiant> Does it work if you move PCs?
[04:32] <dr_willis> same steps.. be sure that grub is goin gto the usb
[04:32] <dr_willis> iit can work
[04:32] <dr_willis> of course moving to a ati based pc   when you ahve nvidia drivers installed can be an annoyance
[04:33] <dr_willis> live-usbs biggest advantage is differnt hardware detection that should work on most systems.
[04:33] <Hyperiant> hmm
[04:33] <dr_willis> but you are going to have a challange getting the  nvidia or fglrx driers working on a live-usb
[04:33] <dr_willis> ive used a 32gb usb as a main system drive for months
[04:34] <Hyperiant> I just bought a 32GB myself, and I'm hoping to use it as a main system drive for my laptop
[04:34] <Hyperiant> But I also want to be able to go to other PCs and boot from it
[04:34] <dr_willis> it should boot.. but depending on whats on the other pcs - some drivers may  not work..
[04:34] <dr_willis> and if you update grub. it may detect the other pc's extra os;s
[04:34] <dr_willis> which then wont work  if you move it to a difffent pc...
[04:35] <dr_willis> but ubuntu should still boot
[04:35] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: I tried xrandr --size 1920x1080 and it says "size 1920x1080 not found in available modes"
[04:35] <Hyperiant> I made a live USB using the help articles on the Ubuntu website; should I delete everything off of the drive before I install "full" Ubuntu?
[04:36] <rsflynn> list
[04:36] <dr_willis> BillyZane2:  i think theres a force option. ive not used the command in years
[04:36] <BillyZane2> i'll check online
[04:37] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  the installer repartions and reformats..
[04:37] <Hyperiant> oh.
[04:38] <Hyperiant> I heard something about ext2 working better than ext3 for small drives
[04:38] <Hyperiant> Should I do that for my 32GB?
[04:38] <dr_willis> i use ext4
[04:39] <dr_willis> dosent really seem to matter to me from what ivbe done with it
[04:39] <Hyperiant> More accurately, the Ubuntu help pages say that ext2 has low overhead
[04:40] <dr_willis> i doubt if you will be able to tell the differance
[04:41] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: I used xrandr --fb 1920x1080 , but the problem now is that my desktop environment is one giant black square with the desktop on the top left corner, and I can move around this black void with my mouse
[04:42] <dr_willis> guess thats progress. ;)
[04:42] <dr_willis> you still using that converter?
[04:42] <BillyZane2> lol
[04:43] <BillyZane2> this video card does not have a VGA port so I have to use it
[04:43] <BillyZane2> unless I switch to DVI, which go tme in trouble in the first place
=== dad_ is now known as Guest31908
[04:43] <dr_willis> i would be using dvi and trying the xrandr commands with it
[04:43] <BillyZane2> I have to also mentioned that the first time i switched to DVI, i was on windows and i blue screened
[04:44] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: I wouldn't be able to get proper res with DVI in windows though. this is so not cool you know?
[04:44] <dr_willis> windows can bluescreen if you look at it funny
[04:44] <BillyZane2> i'm so angry
[04:44] <Hyperiant> Windows is very bsod-happy
[04:44] <BillyZane2> i can't believe this is happening
[04:44] <dr_willis> if you can force the proper res in linux. thers similer tools in windows
[04:45] <BillyZane2> ok
[04:45] <BillyZane2> I can't get this to work

[04:46] <dr_willis> or use vga without that converter
[04:46] <dr_willis> for all we know the converter CANT do the higher ress
[04:46] <dr_willis> it may have limits
[04:46] <Hyperiant> Can I partition part of a drive that's on another computer in my network and use it to boot Ubuntu?
[04:46] <jordo> ryebread: you familiar with Meld?
[04:46] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  you can netboot one pc. from a differnt pc on the lan...
[04:47] <dr_willis> but you havce to setup special services on the server
[04:47] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: it won't let me run using DVI at all
[04:47] <BillyZane2> my computer is totally blank
[04:47] <BillyZane2> the monitor won't even turn on
[04:47] <Hyperiant> you sure that cable works?
[04:47] <dr_willis> you did power DOWN and switch cables then powerd back up?
[04:48] <BillyZane2> i did not
[04:48] <jordo> Zane: you running off a Mobo or graphics card?
[04:48] <dr_willis> hot swaping video can really confuse things
[04:48] <BillyZane2> Hyperiant, : this cable was used with this monitor on another computer and it worked. also, i get signal in windows
[04:48] <BillyZane2> jordo: graphics card
[04:48] <BillyZane2> ok, how about this, i'll power down, switch, power up
[04:48] <jordo> in your bios settings, is the PCI express card set as default for video out?
[04:48] <jordo> sometimes you have to set it
[04:48] <dr_willis> some nvidia cards turn OFF the other ports if you power on and nothing is connected to them
[04:49] <BillyZane2> jordo: I don't know. I do have the on board graphics on though
[04:49] <Hyperiant> If Ubuntu formats my flash drive, can I still use Windows to access the files on it?
[04:49] <jordo> zane: Try going into your bios setup and looking for something along the lines of "default monitor output" or something. it'll either be VGA or PCI i think
[04:50] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  thats another advantage of a live-usb setup.. it uses fat32...  a full install would use ext* and thus windows wont know what to do with it
[04:50] <dr_willis> the various ext* reader tools for windows.. i found rather flakey
[04:51] <Neytiri> how do you mount a LVM drive?
[04:52] <confuzzled-studi> The command, or the tools?
[04:52] <BillyZane2> i will try rebooting and using the DVI
[04:52] <Neytiri> both, i am having to recover data from a system that got sabatoged
[04:52] <histo> BillyZane2: is there a reason you want to use DVI?
[04:52] <BillyZane2> histo: At this point i just want it to work. But ideally, it's so I can connect both of my computers to my monitor without a KVM switch
[04:53] <rsflynn> do you know the name of the LVG?
[04:53] <histo> BillyZane2: how are you goijng to switch between dvi and dsub on your moniotr?   most don't ahve that capability
[04:53] <Hyperiant> Could I partition a part of the drive as FAT32 and format the rest as ext*?
[04:53] <confuzzled-studi> look through synaptic for LVM toolkits, and then read their instruction manuals; or you could download a distro like backbox or backtrack and use their live DVD's to mount, check, possibly repair, and backup the data off the drive
[04:54] <BillyZane2> there's a button on the monitor that says source, i can switch from VGA to DVI input
[04:54] <histo> BillyZane2: does the other computer have dvi?
[04:54] <BillyZane2> histo: actually, yes
[04:55] <BillyZane2> histo: :O
[04:55] <Misty_> hello
[04:55] <BillyZane2> histo, i will try connecting the other computer
[04:55] <histo> BillyZane2: so use vga on this one and dvi on the other for the time being. rather than wasting all this time trouble shooting a wierd issue
[04:55] <Misty_> hello
[04:55] <confuzzled-studi> backbox is slightly more geared for something like that than backtrack - it's more tooled for pen-testing
[04:55] <BillyZane2> histo: i don't mind doing that, but at this point, even the VGA does not work
[04:55] <Misty_> hello
[04:55] <BillyZane2> histo: as soon as i did the switch, it was an irreversible blunder

[05:00] <BillyZane2> one second, let me see if i can connect my second computer to this using DVI
[05:00] <Hyperiant> histo: Are there any disadvantages to using NTFS instead of, say, ext*?
[05:01] <histo> Hyperiant: yes
[05:01] <Confuzzled> yes, writeability
[05:01] <histo> Hyperiant: why would use want to use ntfs on a linux install?
[05:01] <rsflynn> Yes, NTFS support is "experimental" in Ubuntu...
[05:01] <Hyperiant> I want to be able to install full Ubuntu to a USB but still be able to read the files off the drive on a standard Windows PC
[05:01] <Confuzzled> 'nix has some fs-tools for read/write on NTFS volumes, but their not quite release-version, yet
[05:01] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  you dont do a full install to NTFS...
[05:02] <histo> Hyperiant: create another partition on the usb drive that's fat32
[05:02] <BillyZane> Hi, this is BillyZane
[05:02] <histo> Hyperiant: Or you can use unetbootin it creates a fat32 partition and installs ubuntu there.
[05:02] <BillyZane> I am on my windows box
[05:02] <dr_willis> you can easially have a extra partion on the usb thats fat32 or ntfs
[05:03] <BillyZane> holy crap, my screen resolution is capped in this computer too
[05:03] <histo> Hyperiant: http://www.pcworld.com/article/230527/ubuntu_linux_day_16_ext4_vs_ntfs.html
[05:03] <BillyZane> it's definately the monitor or cable
[05:03] <dr_willis> given how cheap 32gb usb are... ;;)
[05:03] <BillyZane> if it's the cable, i'm going to punch the dude i bought it from in the nose
[05:03] <dr_willis> cables are made cheap...
[05:03] <Confuzzled> yeah, keep your nix installs on an ext3 partition, at least, and maybe have a fat32 partition for a swap/share
[05:03] <histo> BillyZane: Then it's the EDID data not getting back from the monitor
[05:03] <dr_willis> this is your 25 ft vga cable?
[05:03] <Misty_> hello
[05:03] <Misty_> people
[05:04] <Misty_> hello people
[05:04] <bradd> BillyZane: I had that issue using a kvm.. I had to add the modes i wanted manually
[05:04] <histo> BillyZane: you can work around that in linux by adding modes to your xorg.conf
[05:04] <Misty_> someone please talk to me
[05:04] <BillyZane> this is a 6 foot used single link DVI cable that I bought off some dude in some ridiculous corner office that's about to get fucked up
[05:04] <histo> Misty_: if you don't have a ubuntu related question please move along
[05:04] <dr_willis> Misty_:  you  have an actual ubuntu support question?
[05:04] <IdleOne> !language | BillyZane
[05:04] <Confuzzled> does anyone off the top of their head know the VESA monitor mode for 1920 * 1080 x 32-bit?
[05:04] <ubottu> BillyZane: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[05:04] <Misty_> no
[05:04] <BillyZane> sorry
[05:05] <histo> IdleOne: he did waste a day of time messing around with it though.
[05:05] <dr_willis> there used to be x modeline generator web sites that would  take your input and show a modeline to put in the xorg.conf
[05:05] <Confuzzled> I'd really like to be able to hard code it into my LILO so I don't have to set the "ASK" flag for video
[05:05] <IdleOne> histo: that doesn't change the rules of this channel.
[05:05] <dr_willis> LILO? how old skool
[05:05] <histo> IdleOne: I know but just to give you some insight to his frustration
[05:05] <BillyZane> ok... at least I know it's not the computer
[05:05] <Hyperiant> histo: I already had a Live USB on there, but I'm told that using a full install of Ubuntu significantly increases performance
[05:05] <IdleOne> histo: I don't need your insight, thank you.
[05:06] <Confuzzled> I'm actually running a dual-boot with Ubuntu Studio and Slackware
[05:06] <Confuzzled> And I vastly prefer LILO to GRUB2
[05:06] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:   its more flexiable at least
[05:06] <histo> Hyperiant: yes if it's running off a hard drive you will see a performance increase
[05:06] <koumorileo> anyone know of a link for info on the wireless adapter drivers to use in ndiswrapper  for Emachines eME528 laptop?
[05:06] <histo> wow
[05:07] <dr_willis> koumorileo:  the exact chipset of the driver will be more  mporntant then the brand. see what lspci says about the card
[05:07] <histo> koumorileo: what wireless chipset is it?
[05:07] <Confuzzled> do you know the driver for the emachines?
[05:07] <Confuzzled> or the chipset?
[05:07] <koumorileo> ok ty
[05:07] <koumorileo> ill get that in a min ... i'm helping a friend over chat
[05:08] <Hyperiant> histo: I suppose my hesitance to use a live is that it seems to work the same way as a dual-boot, and the dual-boot installed on my other PC's hard-drive seems to handle installing things really poorly; Ubuntu Software Center never finishes "applying changes" and I have to install everything by terminal or else it never finishes
[05:08] <bradd> BillyZane: you might be able to do a 'xrandr' to find the display name (such as DFP1, etc) then do a "xrandr --addmode DFP1 --mode 1920x1080"  (or whatever mode you want)
[05:08] <histo> Hyperiant: well I'd look into why it's doing that; as it's not normal behavior.
[05:09] <Hyperiant> histo: I did a little research and it's not an isolated issue, but nothing I've tried has fixed it
[05:10] <Confuzzled> What are you dual-booting hyperiant? You describe something like what I've recently been dealing with - the packager never finishing
[05:11] <Hyperiant> XP and latest Ubuntu
[05:11] <Hyperiant> 12.10 I believe
[05:11] <Confuzzled> yeah, I' running UStudio 12.10, and Slack14 - I had that for a bit, and then I did a fresh install of UStudio, and it worked right.
[05:12] <Confuzzled> But it overwrote my /boot partition with GRUB2, and I've been having a lotof random weirdness on the Slack side since
[05:12] <BillyZane> ok... i'm going to try something different... I have a second VGA cable lying around here. I'll try hooking up my computer to this new cable, which I know has worked in the past to get high resolutions (it has ghosting issues which is why I don't use it), and see if it works then
[05:13] <histo> BillyZane: Please try both computers with it. So we can illiminate ubuntu as being the problem.
[05:13] <amoma> gnome terminal wants to install fonts < echo 0 #do not work
[05:13] <amoma> whats wrong?
[05:13] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, have you been having issues with your package source headers? or your sources timing out as well?
[05:13] <jackson_> can some one change the is bug to critical? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/fglrx-installer/+bug/1058040
[05:13] <histo> amoma: what?

[05:14] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: I'm not sure what the former means, and if the latter means what I think it does, then no
[05:14] <amoma> histo,  how to turn off fonts auto install
[05:15] <histo> amoma: if they are package requirements you cant
[05:15] <amoma> gnome try to install fonts for binaries
[05:15] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, when you go to reload your package sources list, rebuild your package database, you get some http/ftp time-outs, or it being unable to reach sites
[05:15] <histo> amoma: what package are you trying to install?
[05:16] <amoma> histo, i can , this is linux, do you know how ?
[05:16] <[x_]> anyone here using squid + squidGuard?
[05:16] <Hyperiant> I don't recall getting timeouts from my mucking about in the console
[05:16] <zykotick9> amoma: you could try --no-install-recommends but i wouldn't be surprised if the fonts are depends
[05:16] <Confuzzled> I have used squid before in the past
[05:16] <[x_]>  i'm trying to figure out why my squidGuard setup isn't working. I have the following in squid.conf:url_rewrite_program /usr/local/bin/squidGuard -c /usr/local/etc/squid/squidGuard.conf
[05:16] <[x_]> with my squidguard conf set to : http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1565269/
[05:16] <[x_]> however if i go to a url in the ads file, such as merchants.netstep.net, it is not blocked
[05:16] <[x_]>  and we can see squidGuard running, http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1565277/
[05:16] <[x_]>  i built the db files, http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1565275/

[05:17] <histo> amoma: What package are you trying to install?
[05:17] <[x_]> whoopsie
[05:17] <Confuzzled> ok, that was one of my chief problems I had with the installer not completeing properly, and how I ultimately got it fixed
[05:17] <amoma> --no-install-recommend < where to inject this option?
[05:17] <amoma> histo, ?
[05:17] <zykotick9> amoma: with apt-get from terminal
[05:17] <histo> amoma: I don't know how else to state that question to make it easier to understand.
[05:18] <BillyZane2> YOU GUYS
[05:18] <amoma> histo this is not related to installation, it is in user mode
[05:18] <BillyZane2> Igot my display to work. The problem was YET ANOTHER FAULTY VGA CABLE. AHH!!!! I'm GOING TO KILL THOSE CHINESE PPL WhO SOLD ME THIS
[05:19] <amoma> histo, while browsing trough /viewing binary content in gnome terminal
[05:19] <histo> amoma: How do you turn off all fonts auto install?  Is not related to installation?
[05:19] <histo> amoma: wth are you trying to do?
[05:19] <histo> BillyZane2: Whatever wire sends EDID is probably disconnected
[05:20] <BillyZane2> histo: do you think If I use a dual link DVI cable, it will work?
[05:20] <BillyZane2> I'm going to serious kill someone
[05:20] <BillyZane2> no, i'm going to kill some eggs
[05:20] <[snake]> Where are all of the fonts at? (like the directory) I am using ubuntu 12.04 64bit
[05:20] <BillyZane2> i'm going to make some eggs and eat it furiously
[05:20] <amoma> histo, it is aoing , the box popup with message :: gnome-terminal wants to installl fonts, any time i open in gnome terminal a binary file
[05:20] <histo> BillyZane2: I don't know what a dual link cable is
[05:20] <BillyZane2> histo, thank you so much once again
[05:21] <BillyZane2> histo: there are several types of DVI cables. dual link has 2x bandwidth, there are also cables with analoge+ digital. i think i should get the supreme cable. some DVI cables don't have all the pins
[05:21] <histo> amoma: How are you "opening" binary files?
[05:21] <amoma> histo, i looking at that file in raw mode
[05:21] <BillyZane2> histo: dual link and single link don't have ths ame number of pins
[05:21] <BillyZane2> but they are cross compatible
[05:21] <histo> amoma: What is your native language?
[05:21] <Confuzzled> x_ it looks like you're squid.conf is set up to pass all ads through, and your redirect section is commented out, but it's been a couple of years since i've had to set it up
[05:22] <amoma> so i can see all and swith to hex
[05:22] <histo> amoma: perhaps use a hex editor
[05:22] <Confuzzled> snake: /usr/share/fonts
[05:22] <Hyperiant> I made a live USB using the Universal USB Installer; do I have to enable persistence manually?
[05:23] <Confuzzled> yes, hyperiant
[05:23] <amoma> histo, if you dont know ... its ok. I asking if you know how to turn this off, Thats it
[05:23] <histo> amoma: i've never seen it so no I don't.
[05:24] <amoma> histo,  perhaps you never looked at binary file
[05:24] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  been easier to tell it to use perisstance whenyou made it..
[05:24] <histo> amoma: With what?
[05:24] <amoma> histo, it is only on x gnome, it will not happen if x is off
[05:24] <Confuzzled> I've never looked at a binary file in terminal
[05:24] <histo> amoma: What are you using to view the binary you aren't making any sense
[05:24] <histo> You can't gnome-terminal some file foo
[05:25] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: I made a persistence file through the installer (I'm redoing the drive, had wiped it in anticipation of installing full Ubuntu), will this enable persistence without any further input?
[05:25] <amoma> oh my good, do you really getting intrest to inspect binary code ?
[05:25] <Confuzzled> You can open binaries in some programming editors, but i try to avoid code if at all possible
[05:25] <chamunks> is there a command that I can rewrite my MySQL root password via the commandline for somereason its not working anymore on my Ubuntu lamp setup
[05:25] <chamunks> I really need to figure this out quicktime.
[05:25] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  you are not making sence.. if you do a full isntall.. then it dosent use the persstance file...
[05:25] <histo> Wow fail
[05:26] <amoma> it is perfectly safe to inspect what is in binaries, who you scare ?
[05:26] <histo> amoma: gnome-terminal cannot edit binaries
[05:26] <Confuzzled> it should, depending on the live usb creation tool
[05:26] <histo> amoma: or view them
[05:26] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: I've been urged by chat to just use a live USB, as it provides more compatibility without a significant lag increase
[05:26] <amoma> i do not want edit, i want to see
[05:26] <archzombie> Can I download the ubuntu phone beta? I have a galaxy nexus by sprint, is it available for that?
[05:26] <histo> amoma: well you can't with gnome-terminal
[05:26] <amoma> or rather search
[05:26] <Confuzzled> Hyperiant, my preference is unetbootin
[05:27] <histo> !phone > archzombie
[05:27] <ubottu> archzombie, please see my private message
[05:27] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  then you  are not doing a full install.. you just use the live installer maker thing...
[05:27] <histo> amoma: You need to use a hex viewer or editor
[05:27] <amoma> definietly i can i do this for years
[05:27] <histo> amoma: really how?
[05:27] <Confuzzled> amoma: opening in a proggramming editor doesn't mean you have to edit, but terminal isn't equipped by default to handle opening binary files for inspection
[05:27] <amoma> now i getting this upset message on ubuntu
[05:28] <Confuzzled> yeah, open up your files using emacs or jed or joe or something
[05:28] <histo> amoma: gnome-terminal is just a X terminal nothing more
[05:28] <amoma> ok in terminal i opening midnight commander
[05:28] <histo> amoma: Okay so you are using mc to look at a binary
[05:28] <Confuzzled> wrong program to try to open a binary file in
[05:28] <histo> jesus
[05:28] <amoma> but this do not mater since it is fro gnome terminal
[05:28] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: I'm using it, but do I need to enable persistence in Ubuntu or will it be automatically enabled when I boot into it?  Also, is there a way to turn off the try/install thing and make it take less time to boot up?
[05:29] <Confuzzled> mc will attempt to run it, notshow you the code
[05:29] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  you tell the installer tool the size of the peristantce file to use.. and it uses it
[05:29] <amoma> Confuzzled, < as you say
[05:30] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, if you've got persistence set up when you installed it on the thumb-drive, it should work automagically, and you can't really turn off the try/install thing unless you do a different sort of install
[05:30] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: different sort?
=== c_smith is now known as c_smith_away
[05:31] <histo> amoma: Are you using F4 to view the hex?
[05:31] <amoma> so where is con fig file controlling install of all the alien fonts ?
[05:31] <histo> amoma: possibly in gconf somewhere.
[05:31] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, try unetbootin for your thumb-drive, I think you can use it to install to a usb as if it were an SSD HDD, rather than a thumb-drive with an *.iso on it
[05:31] <dr_willis> alien fonts?
[05:31] <amoma> histo, f4 f8 depends what i look for
[05:31] <histo> amoma:And when does the prompt for fonts come up?
[05:32] <amoma> dr_willis, klions for example,
[05:32] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Yes, but then comes the issue I was talking about before; it also needs to be read/writable by any Windows PC
[05:32] <dr_willis> i just drag/drop new fonts into my   .fonts directory   ;)
[05:32] <dr_willis> or double click on them and use their installer tool
[05:32] <amoma> histo, the prompt is pop up box gnome related
[05:32] <histo> dr_willis: he is saying that when he looks at a hex editor in gnome-terminal it prompts him to install fonts
[05:33] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, you can create a seperate FAT32 partition on the drive as a swap/share /home
[05:33] <dr_willis> cant say ive ever seen a hex editor need any extra fonts,
[05:34] <dr_willis> there are terminal  based hex editors thata would use the normal terminal fonts also.
[05:34] <histo> dr_willis: rigth I have no idea wth he is talking about either
[05:34] <amoma> histo, i searched all etc and .hiden for string fonts and all combination, i asking for help second day
[05:34] <dr_willis> histo:  this seems to be the day for confusons
[05:34] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: I'd like to keep as much Windows-accessible space as possible because I don't know how much I'll be using, but at the same time I'm not sure how much Ubuntu space I'll be using, and it'd be a pain to constantly keep expanding partitions and/or reformatting
[05:34] <histo> amoma: I've never seen gnome-terminal prompt for a font installation
[05:35] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  best answer.. get a 2nd usb flash  drive. ;))
[05:35] <histo> amoma: and based on some google searches I don't believe it does.
[05:35] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, another option you might consider would be to use one of the many system configuration tools to create a live-cd based off of the distribution and customizations of the ubuntu-box you're using,
[05:35] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: I may very well do this, haha
[05:35] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, what size drive are you using?
[05:35] <histo> Hyperiant: What is your ultimate goal here?
[05:36] <Confuzzled> ^^^^^
[05:36] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: 32GB
[05:36] <histo> omfg
[05:36] <histo> Hyperiant: that's plenty of space for a seperate storage partition
[05:36] <Confuzzled> What's you're ultimate goal with all of this?
[05:36] <dr_willis> unless you need like 30gb for windows.. ;)
[05:37] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: A USB drive that's bootable from multiple computers, writable and readable from Windows, and doesn't break when I use Ubuntu Software Center to load programs
[05:38] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  you dont wan tto be install ing a lot  via software center to a live-usb.. thats just a fact of life.. you can do some.. but  its Not going to be as flexiable as a full install
[05:38] <koumorileo> ok we found device id  14e4:4357
[05:38] <Confuzzled> Create a bootable ext3 partition of ~8GB for '/', and then partition the rest in FAT32
[05:38] <dr_willis> a live usb -  has limitations in what will work if you install it.
[05:38] <histo> Hyperiant: That would be a normal Ubuntu usb disk with perisistance.  It's already formatted in fat32
[05:39] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: What limitations, for example, might I run into?
[05:39] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  installing newer kernels, drivers, may not work right
[05:39] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Would 8GB be enough for packages?  I don't want to have to reformat to expand the partition
[05:39] <[x_]> anyone use squidGuard?
[05:39] <dr_willis> and theres going to  be size imitaions when your persistanc file fills up
[05:39] <amoma> histo, just typing the string:https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=501023
[05:39] <ubottu> bugzilla.redhat.com bug 501023 in gnome-packagekit "gnome-terminal wants to confuse you about installing a font" [Medium,Closed: nextrelease]
[05:40] <amoma> first of 180K
[05:40] <Confuzzled> yes, if you set /home to be on your FAT32, should be plenty, depending on what you're installing.
[05:40] <Hyperiant> wait, what
[05:40] <Confuzzled> I am also a minimalist, and uninstall as much garbage as possible
[05:40] <Confuzzled> like all of Unity
[05:40] <dr_willis> home on a fat32 will have its own limitions also
[05:40] <zykotick9> dr_willis: i'm not 100% sure "persistance" even allows for programs to be installed... i think it might only be file storage...  i could be wrong.
[05:41] <Confuzzled> yes, but it will maintain your maximum windoze compatibility
[05:41] <dr_willis> zykotick9:  it does.. but if you do it a lot - you can run into issues.
[05:41] <amoma> and with strin"ubuntu" http://osdir.com/ml/ubuntu-bugs/2009-09/msg10869.html
[05:41] <dr_willis> zykotick9:   ir ecall issues with kernels. and  the nvidia and fgrx drivers
[05:41] <Confuzzled> persistance tracks configuration changes, and some package installs... but it has to process with every start up and shutdown
[05:41] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: What limitations would it be for having /home/ on FAT32?  Would it install packages to the FAT32 partition and boot from the ext4 partition?
[05:41] <amoma> histo, http://osdir.com/ml/ubuntu-bugs/2009-09/msg10869.html
[05:42] <zykotick9> dr_willis: i find full install to usb makes a lot more sense then persistance
[05:42] <amoma> histo, aparently is not only me
[05:42] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: That was one of my other main issues; my USB drive takes about twenty minutes to boot from my craptop
[05:42] <Confuzzled> I would run root on an ext3, rather than ext4 if compatibility is considered to be an issue
[05:42] <histo> amoma: assuming you are using a 2009 version of fedora then yes
[05:42] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  no owndership, no modes,  and things  other things from Not using a real  linux supported filesystem. vvfat does not have all the features that ext2/3/4 does
[05:42] <histo> amoma: That is an antient bug
[05:43] <dr_willis> 20 min? what is it? a USB-1 ?
[05:43] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: I believe so, this is a pretty old laptop
[05:43] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, I would figure out exactly what you're looking to do with the drive, and then exstimate a conservative partition size for root, /usr, and /home
[05:43] <koumorileo> question ... will the driver for 14e4:4357 be different from 14e4:4358 for ndiswrapper ?
[05:43] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: I have a USB 2.0 card but I doubt WIndows auto-detects it
[05:43] <amoma> histo, ancient but surviving, like neanderthal
[05:43] <histo> amoma: On that bug  they added a gconf key it looks like.
[05:43] <Hyperiant> Rather, I doubt that my laptop can boot from it
[05:44] <histo> amoma: perhaps file a bug report with gnome then
[05:44] <histo> amoma: or use a different terminal for the time being
[05:44] <amoma> ok, i can live with dis
[05:44] <amoma> ut it just pesky annoing
[05:44] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, you can customize your paths to folders inside your home directory to point to locations on the FAT fs, and that way all of your configuration files should be retained ona  native linux fs
[05:45] <amoma> histo, of corse if i turn F{2..6} i can do it ,
[05:45] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: For the Ubuntu portion, I intend to install assorted utilities, and optimistically a few games
[05:45] <amoma> but it is set back those days to advise not to use x
[05:45] <Confuzzled> ece it's primarily a single user system, I have dox, downs, pix, movs folders that are shared across my distros
[05:45] <histo> amoma: right becuase you aren't using gnome-terminal I'd assume soem other terminals won't act the same way
[05:46] <histo> amoma: There are plenty of other terminal choices in X
[05:46] <mahamaya> Mahamaya
[05:46] <amoma> histo, ok i dont thisn but trying , thanks now
[05:46] <BillyZane2> now that I have it on 2024x1152 with ghosting... i have to admit.. the resolution is too big. I can't see the writing on xchat
[05:47] <mahamaya> Mahamaya tripathi
[05:47] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, i'de set up your usb as a full install, and install your ntfs, and nfs tool packages, and you should be plenty fine with 8GB of space for /, especially if you re-path your documents and stuff to the FAT32 partition
[05:48] <dr_willis> BillyZane2:  dont make me slap you....   ;P
[05:48] <BillyZane2> lol
[05:48] <dr_willis> make the fonts larger...
[05:48] <dr_willis> the whole point of the monitor was to show 2 pages side by side. :)  you need a 60 in plasma tv?
[05:48] <Confuzzled> hyperiant - one thing I would be sure to do though is ditch the unity WM for something like gnome, kde, or xfce
[05:49] <Confuzzled> unity is a giant sack of unneccesary bloat
[05:49] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  if the pc is that old.. what are its other specs?
[05:49] <dr_willis> !fud | Confuzzled
[05:49] <ubottu> Confuzzled: Please do not fall prey to, or spread FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) - it is not welcome here!  Please see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt
[05:49] <koumorileo> ok so after a search on ubuntuforums i found an answer to a 14e4:4358 but i cant find out if 14e4:4357 will run with the same driver ... any suggestions ?
[05:49] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: 1.6GHz Celeron, 898MB RAM, 80GB HDD
[05:49] <BillyZane2> Dr_willis: I'm very close to abandoning windows.. I can feel it. The very last step in the process is setting up an SSH account
[05:49] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:   you are using 12.04 or 12.10?
[05:50] <BillyZane2> now.. I have openssh-server installed
[05:50] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: 12.10
[05:50] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  lubuntu may be better suited for a low end  machine..  12.10 requires a CPU  with PAE also..  so i guess if it works.. then the cpu has pae. ;)
[05:50] <BillyZane2> umm.. let me figure out how to config this
[05:50] <Speiros> Hello.  Can someone help me with why my mic might not work on ubuntu 10.04?
[05:51] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: PAE?
[05:51] <dr_willis> BillyZane2:  i just install then use.. ;) not much to configure for ssh
[05:51] <dr_willis> !pea
[05:51] <dr_willis> !pae
[05:51] <ubottu> To use more than ~3.2GB RAM on a 32bit system you can install the PAE-enabled kernel. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE for more info
[05:51] <dr_willis> a lot of very old hardwre dosent have PAE - so is limited to 12.04
[05:51] <Hyperiant> ah
[05:51] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, on somehting that old, i'd use xfce as a wm over unity. yeah, it's pretty, but it will slow you down more than you need.
[05:51] <Hyperiant> well, Ubuntu dual-booted just fine with 12.10
[05:51] <dr_willis> so your system is not super old...
[05:52] <dr_willis> Lubuntu works well for older systems.
[05:52] <Confuzzled> I've run on an older P4 than that, but I also had 1GB RDRAM with it
[05:52] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: Can it do that really cool thing where you can tile windows to, for example, share a screen equally
=== test2 is now known as IcePee
[05:52] <BillyZane2> I have a question. Suppose I enter SSH and i want to initiate a GUI environment. I would need to install an extremely minimal GUI right? One that would work well over an internet connection. I was using a unix system earlier today and it had a really simple GUI that worked very well. Is there something like that for linux?
[05:53] <yatriga> which is the best video editoy
[05:53] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: Admittedly it's a bit of a stretch if it's a lightweight OS, to be able to tile windows and swap workspaces like in Unity
[05:53] <Confuzzled> i can't remember the name, but there is an rdesktop app designed to run over an ssh connection
[05:54] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, if you're committed to the ubuntu-distro, i would switch up your WM.
[05:55] <Confuzzled> if not, i'd look into other distro's of 'nix
[05:55] <dr_willis> !info freenx
[05:55] <ubottu> Package freenx does not exist in quantal
[05:55] <dr_willis> hmm..
[05:55] <Hyperiant> I can let go of swapping workspaces, that much is a luxury
[05:55] <dr_willis> BillyZane2:  ssh and its x forwarding lets you forward a single app easially :) thats about all i ever need
[05:56] <Hyperiant> Being able to tile windows to share half a screen is extremely useful though
[05:56] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  even the most basic window manager for linux ive seen.. has Workspaces.. ;) its been a feature for decades
[05:56] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: Oh, that's encouraging then
[05:56] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  lubuntu works well.. it uses openbox. or you could just use openbox by itself
[05:57] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, for a machine with <1GB of RAM, I really wouldn't use any WM heavier than XFCE or LDXE, unless you're running a super-minimal distro, then maybe would I branch out into KDE
[05:57] <dr_willis> it gets to a point where its silly to try to use a uber-light desktop.. because 99% of your resources are being used by your  browser or other apps anyway. ;)
[05:57] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: Oooooo.. i seee.. so if you want a terminal, you would forward xterm, and if you want a GUI, you would forward the gui interface app or something
[05:57] <Confuzzled> XFCE is lightweight enough that you can still easily swap WorkSpaces
[05:57] <Hyperiant> What about compatibility between distros, then?  Are there programs that are incompatible with some distros over others?
[05:57] <dr_willis> a simple window manager..  and then run what apps ya need from a terminal
[05:58] <dr_willis> BillyZane2:  not much need to forward a xterm over ssh.. since ssh allready gives you a terminal. ;) but its doable
[05:58] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: good point
[05:58] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: would LXDE be a good candidate for an "app" to forward?
[05:58] <Confuzzled> it's more of a question of apps that require/designed for services provided by a particular desktop environment
[05:58] <amoma> histo, you are right
[05:58] <Confuzzled> QT apps versus gnome-apps
[05:58] <dr_willis> billyzane2  thats not an APP.. its a whole desktop
[05:58] <amoma> histo, you are right
[05:59] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: is it possible to forward a desktop?
[05:59] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: For a more specific example, I hope to run Steam on whatever distro I pick, and all I know for sure is that it probably supports Ubuntu
[05:59] <Speiros> So does anyone know if I can change some settings to get the microphone to work, or do I need something else installed?
[05:59] <dr_willis> billyzane2  its possible but a  bit pointless
[05:59] <dr_willis>  and going to  be slow
[05:59] <BillyZane2> dr_willis: how come?
[05:59] <amoma> xterm and KDE konsole do not exhibit this buggy behavior
[05:59] <dr_willis> you are forwarding like 20+ seperate apps....
[05:59] <BillyZane2> KDE!!that's what i was using earlier
[05:59] <dr_willis> vs the one you really wan tto use
[06:00] <dr_willis> vnc and freenx are for shareing a whole desktop
[06:00] <BillyZane2> I was in a KDE environment earlier (SunOS), would this be possible with SSH on ubunutu?
[06:00] <histo> BillyZane2: you can forward X apps over ssh yes
[06:00] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, if you wanna steam, then I'd probably stick with an ubuntu-based distro, and go with a minimalistic WM, like LDFE or XFCE or hell, even something like fluxbox
[06:00] <dr_willis> you can install kde on ubuntu..
[06:00] <amoma> othervise gnome is infected with "anciend bug"
[06:00] <Confuzzled> billyzane2: Kubuntu
[06:00] <spyzer> hey everyone, i am unable to find a channel where i can ask gtk devel related question :(
[06:00] <spyzer> please help
[06:01] <BillyZane2> but this was a very very downgraded version of KDE, it looked like wolfenstein3D
[06:01] <dr_willis> !alias | spyzer
[06:01] <dr_willis> !alis | spyzer
[06:01] <ubottu> spyzer: alis is a services bot that can help you find channels. Read "/msg alis help list" for help and ask any questions about it in #freenode. Example usage: /msg alis list #ubuntu* or /msg alis list *http*
[06:01] <BillyZane2> histo: i was using a very downgraded KDE over SSH earlier, i was wondering if i could have the same experience with SSH on ubuntu
[06:01] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Looking at Fluxbox, it seems really...fluid in terms of visuals.  How would it look when I installed it?
[06:01] <BillyZane2> this was unix proper though
[06:02] <Confuzzled> Hyperiant: it would look like Win 3.0
[06:02] <dr_willis> simple window managers look simple... ;))
[06:02] <tekkbuzz> Use the command xhost to allow all connections from your host:
[06:02] <tekkbuzz> xhost +host (with "host" being the name or ip)
[06:02] <Confuzzled> right-click on an open area of the desktop to bring up a 'start' menu to pick whatever programs you're trying to run
[06:03] <BillyZane2> brb, i'm gona get in to xfce
[06:03] <machicola> how do i filter OUT output with grep? i'm using fping i.e. 'sudo fping -g 192.168.3.0/24 | grep available' and it lists the results with the string 'available' then spams the screen with massive other unwanted output
[06:03] <Confuzzled> it's very VERY basic, but highly configurable if you're willing to put int the time to learn to do so
[06:03] <Hyperiant> dr_willis, Confuzzled: So it's lubuntu as a distro?  If that's the case, is there any WM either of you two would recommend?  (and how would I go about installing them/uninstalling the old one anyway)
[06:03] <DarwinSurvivor> machicola: grep -v
[06:04] <Confuzzled> whereas, XFCE is more like a desktop-environment that most people are used to
[06:04] <dr_willis> !lubuntu | Hyperiant
[06:04] <ubottu> Hyperiant: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[06:04] <Confuzzled> XFCE even supports some basic 'widget-liike' apps
[06:04] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  i would say time to quit dawdling.. and go inssttall lubuntu live to your flash and try it
[06:05] <histo> machicola: you couold use cut
[06:05] <DarwinSurvivor> machicola: unless you are talking about content printed to stderr, in which case you want to do "sudo fping -g 192.168.3.0/24 2>/dev/null | grep available"
[06:05] <Confuzzled> Hyperiant: Xubuntu is the same, with XFCE. research lighter-eight WM, and figure out which one strikes your fancy
[06:05] <machicola> not stderr i don't believe
[06:05] <histo> machicola: can you pastebin your output
[06:06] <Confuzzled> although, with a 32 GB thumbdrive, you could probably install one or the other, and run a version of ubuntu that has both WM's, which you can choose from at your login screen
[06:06] <machicola> ok
[06:06] <BillyZane2> hi i'm back
[06:06] <dubey> Hello
[06:06] <BillyZane2> hi
[06:06] <Confuzzled> I run UStudio, and I have at least 3 WM's installed, and I use thme all for slightly different purposes
[06:06] <zorg24> I have a Lenovo W530 and just installed ubuntu can anyone help me get the correct drivers for the graphics card, its a Nvidia Quadro K1000M
[06:07] <dubey> Is it possible to take screenshot of ubuntu system when it boots up and shows the grub list ?
[06:07] <BillyZane2> well.. lets just say i have openssh-server installed... I suppose I could test out logging on.. would the command be... ssh local ?
[06:07] <DarwinSurvivor> machicola: can you give us an example of what you are getting and an example of what you would like to get (pastebin works best)?
[06:07] <amoma> histo, thanx , i using now KDE konsole, after some color change 3 click it work perfect with mc. If you spot somehow info how to fix it in gnome term i will greatly appreciate this tip.
[06:07] <Confuzzled> IMHO, Konsole > gnoem-terminal
[06:07] <histo> amoma: idk if you poke around in gconf you may be able to find some setting
[06:08] <bradd> BillyZane2: ssh localhost or maybe ssh 127.0.0.1 . Both should connect to the current host
[06:08] <BillyZane2> it says connection refused (for localhost)
[06:08] <dr_willis> on the machine you installed ssh on..  you shhould be able to 'ssh localhost;
[06:08] <BillyZane2> let me check...
[06:09] <BillyZane2> it says... "ssh: connect to local host port 22: connection refused
[06:09] <dr_willis> sounds like you dont have the ssh server insgtalled
[06:09] <histo> BillyZane2: take a look at you /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[06:09] <[x_]> anyone use squidGuard?
[06:09] <dr_willis> i forget the package name...
[06:09] <dr_willis> openssh-server or somthing like that
[06:09] <BillyZane2> LOL, i did not have it installed
[06:09] <BillyZane2> it was installed on my virtualbox
[06:09] <machicola> DarwinSurvivor, yeah... sorry, just havin some issues
[06:10] <amoma> BillyZane, if you have installed service sshd start
[06:10] <BillyZane2> histo: sorry, it wasn't installed
[06:10] <machicola> its spamming the heck out of my output
[06:10] <BillyZane2> i'm gona try connecting...
[06:10] <zorg24> I have a Lenovo W530 and just installed ubuntu can anyone help me get the correct drivers for the graphics card, its a Nvidia Quadro K1000M
[06:11] <BillyZane2> says, the authenticity of host 'local host (127.0.0.1)' can't be established.. ECDSA key finger print is oijdfoijdf..

[06:11] <zorg24> thanks ubottu
[06:12] <BillyZane2> ok, i added yes yes, it says... permantly added 'localhost' ECDSA to the list of known hosts
[06:12] <temp_> A bit of help someone?

[06:12] <BillyZane2> histo: i try to run codeblocks, it says unable to initialize gtk, is DISPLAY set properly?
[06:13] <histo> BillyZane2: ssh -X localhost
[06:13] <dubey> anyone has done this ?
[06:13] <DarwinSurvivor> zorg24: http://www.thinkwiki.org/ has LOTS of information about using Linux on thinkpads (helped me with my x220 multiple times)
[06:13] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Well, it looks like I'm probably gonna use lubuntu then.  How should I partition?
[06:13] <BillyZane2> histo: i tried that, i'm in... i tried codeblocks again, it says the same msg, unable to initialize gtk
[06:13] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  you doing a live or full install?
[06:13] <zorg24> DarwinSurvivor: I tried that but couldn
=== atriusz is now known as atrius
[06:14] <zorg24> 't seem to find the right thing
[06:14] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: Full this time, hahaha
[06:14] <histo> BillyZane2: try -Y just for giggles
[06:14] <BillyZane2> lol, ok
[06:14] <DarwinSurvivor> zorg24: it's got more information on some machines that others, so it really depends on which model you have
[06:14] <temp_> H,,
[06:14] <BillyZane2> histo: same msg
[06:14] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  id jsust setup the whole flash as  your lubuntu  install then. a /  and a swap partition.
[06:14] <histo> BillyZane2: also try another app like xclock or something
[06:14] <temp_> Could really use some help.
[06:14] <BillyZane2> hmm.. not ssh?
[06:15] <BillyZane2> i think openssh is a good app no?
[06:15] <BillyZane2> it's super secure
[06:15] <zorg24> DarwinSurvivor, oh well the W530 is brand new so I wouldn't be surprised if they don't have a ton yet
[06:15] <[x_]> BillyZane, yes
[06:15] <[x_]> BillyZane2, yes
[06:15] <dr_willis> temp_:  state the problem to the channel yet? Ive not seen it...
[06:15] <BillyZane2> BillyZane, : should i try running xclock on the ssh server?
[06:15] <histo> BillyZane2: No try opening another X application
[06:15] <BillyZane2> ok
[06:15]  * [x_] lulz
[06:15] <histo> BillyZane2: like xclock
[06:15] <temp_> I'm new to this, sorry.
[06:16] <temp_> I'm trying to install ubuntu SE.
[06:16] <BillyZane2> histo: error, can't open display
[06:16] <histo> BillyZane2: what are you sshing from
[06:16] <[x_]> dont ssh me
[06:16] <BillyZane2> histo: i'm SSHing from konsole
[06:16] <temp_> But I'm having difficulties. i actually installed ubuntu for that in specific.
[06:16] <histo> BillyZane2: to the same box?
[06:16] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: Just throwing this out there; can Android read ext4-formatted USB drives?  My phone supports USB hosting and it -is- based off of Linux
[06:16] <BillyZane2> histo, yeah i'm basically connecting to myself. i type ssh -X localhost
[06:17] <histo> BillyZane2: check your sshd_config and make sure X11 forwarding is enabled
[06:17] <BillyZane2> hmm.. ok
[06:17] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  havent really noticed.. ive seen  some android tablets/phones  have packages that let you use ext* for your sd card.. so it may depend on the specific android device
[06:17] <BillyZane2> should i do that by typing ... cat /ssh/sshd_config ?
[06:17] <DarwinSurvivor> temp_: if you are having trouble installing ubuntu se (I'm assuming you mean Satanic Edition), you will need to contact the Ubuntu SE support channels as we have no way of knowing what changes they have made to ubuntu when they created their derivative
[06:17] <histo> BillyZane2: cat /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[06:18] <BillyZane2> histo: i almost had it :D
[06:18] <histo> BillyZane2: or less /etc/ssh/sshd_config  would be easier
[06:18]  * dr_willis wondered what Ubuntu SE was...
[06:18] <temp_> Alright, thank you!
[06:18] <temp_> how do I do that, exactly?
[06:18] <dr_willis> UbuntuSatanic edition.. is not worth using...  i suggest sticking to the real ubuntu
[06:19] <temp_> What's the difference?
[06:19] <dr_willis> so many pointless variants
[06:19] <DarwinSurvivor> temp_: their forums are at http://ubuntusatanic.org/forum/ I'm not sure if they have an IRC channel or not
[06:19] <dr_willis> temp_ if you dont know the differances.. then why choose it?
[06:19] <BillyZane2> histo: there's a big problem.. i opened the file, there was some stuff so i typed yes... now there's just a bunch of Y's being repeated again and again
[06:19] <histo> wth
[06:19] <temp_> For the looks of it. haha
[06:19] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: If I have files on my flash drive, how would you recommend getting them off?
[06:19] <dr_willis> pointless reason to choose a disrto.. because of the them
[06:19] <histo> BillyZane2: ctrl+c
[06:19] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  copy them to your ubuntu one account. ;)
[06:20] <temp_> Alright, well, thank you guys. have a good evening.
[06:20] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: hrm, not a bad idea
[06:20] <histo> BillyZane2: less /etc/ssh/sshd_config   or gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config
[06:20] <BillyZane2> histo, i closed it and started again
[06:20] <Hyperiant> dr_willis: There's no way to do it without booting up in Ubuntu though, huh :/
[06:20] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  thers ubuntu one for android now also
[06:20] <histo> dr_willis: satanic edition really?
[06:20] <dr_willis> histo:  when children have to much spare time on their hands....
[06:20] <dr_willis> ;)
[06:21] <BillyZane2> histo: i opened the file in gedit
[06:21] <dr_willis> histo:  ranks up there with 'Hanna Montana' linux...
[06:21] <BillyZane2> histo: i found X11Forwarding yes, evidently it's enabled
[06:21] <histo> dr_willis: satanists need their own distro i guess
[06:22] <histo> If that's what their even called
[06:22]  * dr_willis makes MyLittlePonyBuntu
[06:22] <[x_]> which is better dansguardian or squidGuard?
[06:22]  * histo makes kidsareretardedubuntu
[06:22] <BillyZane2> lol
[06:22] <DarwinSurvivor> dr_willis: you have no idea how popular that would be. put ranbow dash on the front and 3/4 of reddit and 4chan would be running Linux!
[06:22] <histo> lol
[06:23] <dr_willis> then CatBuntu for the other 1/4
[06:23] <histo> yeah with an animated gif desktop
[06:23] <histo> they'd be in heaven
[06:23] <dr_willis> FarmvillBuntu
[06:24]  * dr_willis stops now.
[06:24] <histo> BillyZane2: Yet you can't forward X apps

[06:24] <histo> lol
[06:24] <BillyZane2> lol
[06:25] <BillyZane2> histo, i'm not sure what it means, perhaps i can't run any app?
[06:25] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Lubuntu unpartitioned sound good?  Or do you have anything to say about it?
[06:25] <BillyZane2> should I pastebin the sshd_config ?
[06:26] <Hyperiant> I'd really honestly like to be able to -use- the flash drive for moving files from computer to computer
[06:26] <histo> BillyZane2: ssh -X localhost xclock
[06:26] <histo> BillyZane2: should open xclock
=== zhurai-tsuki is now known as zhurai
[06:26] <Hyperiant> Now that I think about it, I don't need more than about 1GB for file storage, so should I partition it for that much?
[06:26] <BillyZane2> histo: it worked!!!
[06:27] <Hyperiant> BillyZane2: Many congratulations
[06:27] <BillyZane2> hyperiant: TY :)
[06:27] <Confuzzled> Hyperiant, partition for much more, you never know what you'll run into
[06:27] <BillyZane2> a clock popped up histo. it was a surprise to me too
[06:27] <histo> Hyperiant: Will you please just use unetbootin or whatever the installation instructions suggest. Create a persistant install. IT WILL FORMAT TEH ENTIRE STICK FAT32
[06:28] <Confuzzled> I've got a 4.5TB RAID-5 NAS unit for things like that
[06:28] <histo> BillyZane2: Okay well X forwarding over ssh works
[06:28] <BillyZane2> OMG codeblocks is running now too
[06:28] <Hyperiant> histo: It's not a full install, though, it's live
[06:28] <BillyZane2> BillyZane, : suppose i'm on a windows computer when i'm using SSH
[06:28] <zorg24> DarwinSurvivor, damn I feel silly turns out there is a driver on nvidias site.....
[06:28] <histo> Hyperiant: it doesn't matter either way you are installing to USB
[06:28] <BillyZane2> errr
[06:28] <histo> Hyperiant: there is no difference
[06:28] <BillyZane2> histo: suppose i'm using windows at school...
[06:28] <BillyZane2> histo: there wouldn't be any problem? wouldn't I need a GUI environment?
[06:29] <histo> BillyZane2: you need a local X server to handle the forwarded application. So you'd have to use cygwin to install X on windows
[06:29] <BillyZane2> or does SSH come with it
[06:29] <quietone> my partner's new Dell is asleep or hibernating, how do we wake it up?
[06:29] <Hyperiant> histo: Live makes a persistence file that's huge and has to be completely loaded on startup; my laptop takes about 20 minutes to do that
[06:29] <Confuzzled> you don't */need/* a GUI, it just makes things easier for some people
[06:29] <histo> quietone: push a key
[06:29] <histo> Hyperiant: okay well then install it to a fat32 usb
[06:29] <Ben64> zorg24: you can install the 310 drivers from the repository, they support your card
[06:30] <quietone> histo, so far we have tried every  key, function keys, and Ctl-Alt-F1
[06:30] <histo> Hyperiant: or create a seperate partition fat32
[06:30] <BillyZane2> histo: i use X-win32 at school for SSH. it opened up a ... kde environment. a very very low overhead version that worked very well
[06:30] <histo> Hyperiant: you've been trying to decide for hours now. It's just a usb. Try it one way if you don't like it format start over
[06:30] <Hyperiant> histo: That's what I'm debating whether to do; question is, how much space should I reserve for FAT32 and how much should I reserve for ext4
[06:30] <Confuzzled> Hyperiant, I'de see what I could do about making use of that 80GB IDE you've got installed, and set that up to use GRUB2 for a bootloader to dual-boot buntu with your XP
[06:30] <histo> quietone: power button?
[06:31] <histo> !best | Hyperiant
[06:31] <ubottu> Hyperiant: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[06:31] <quietone> histo, oh yes, we did that to
[06:31] <histo> quietone: okay why do you think it's sleeping?
[06:31] <Confuzzled> and whatever you do, I'd create a seperate partition for storage, so that your winows partition and ubuntu /root can be reinstalled without you having to worry about what you're going to lose
[06:32] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: wait, what
[06:32] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Oh, as a storage for documents and stuff
[06:32] <histo> Hyperiant: you can partition a flash drive just like a hard drive. So install linux on /dev/sdb1  create /dev/sdb2 and format it for fat32  for winblows compatibility
[06:32] <histo> !dualboot | Hyperiant
[06:32] <ubottu> Hyperiant: Dual boot instructions: x86/AMD64: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DualBoot/Windows - Macs: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBookPro https://help.ubuntu.com/community/YabootConfigurationForMacintoshPowerPCsDualBoot
[06:33] <Confuzzled> there isn't any law saying that youre documents, music, and movies have to be kept on the same partition, physical or logical, as your root directorites foreither windoze or linux
[06:33] <zorg24> Ben64, what repo?
[06:33] <histo> BillyZane2: I'll have to look up X-win32 i'm not familiar with it
[06:33] <Hyperiant> histo: I didn't understand any of that
[06:33] <BillyZane2> histo: i was able to connect to my school computer :D
[06:34] <Confuzzled> make a seperate partition for persistent storage of your personal effects, so you can experiment with whatever OS, app, or program floats your fancy at any second
[06:34] <histo> BillyZane2: yes you can use xwin32 according to their documentation that's what it's for
=== atrius_away is now known as atrius
[06:34] <BillyZane2> histo: thank you so much
[06:34] <quietone> histo, your're right, I don't know what state its in. Screen is blank, fan may run. It happened after the lid was closed for dinner
[06:35] <histo> Hyperiant: You can have multiple operating systems on one hard drive. You know this right?  Like your computer can boot Windows and Linux from the same hard drive.
[06:35] <Hyperiant> histo: I know that, but everything after that made absolutely no sense to me
[06:35] <histo> quietone: usually it's sleeping. It may hybernate if the battery was runing low.
[06:35] <histo> Hyperiant: Okay so you are still wavering on usb vs hdd then or what?
[06:36] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, i would figure a way out to save my data, and then I would reparition, reformat, and reinstall your primary 80GB IDE HDD in your 1.6GHz celery box to dual-boot your XP and your Xubuntu. use one parition for Xubuntu/Lubuntu, use on for winblows, and use a third for storage of all of your data
[06:36] <Hyperiant> ahahaha celery box
[06:36] <quietone> histo, it's been plugged in all day.
[06:37] <histo> quietone: hrm.. Well hold the power button for five seconds will turn it completely off.
[06:37] <Ben64> zorg24: the normal ubuntu ones
[06:37] <zorg24> oh ok
[06:38] <Confuzzled> that away, when windoze comes out with a new win9 that can run on old hardware, you can upgrade to that, or if your windoze gets sick or something. if you decide you don't like xuuntu and want to try lubuntu, or kubuntu, or slackware 14 (;)) then you can refort that individual partition, and retain all of your downloaded music and games and whatnot on a third, and seperate parition
[06:38] <zorg24> Ben64, what's the package called
[06:38] <histo> Hyperiant: if you insist on using usb and you stated earlier you ahve a 32gb usb. I would give 10gb to ubuntu and 22gb as a data storage partition.
[06:38] <quietone> histo, yea, that's what we have been doing. I was just hoping ....
[06:38] <Confuzzled> if you use FAT32 for your data partition, it is mountable, readable, and writeable by every OS out there you'll probably ever consider using
[06:38] <histo> quietone: then look at your power options after it comes back on. I have mine go to sleep on lid close if it's plugged in
[06:39] <Ben64> zorg24:
[06:39] <Ben64> zorg24: nvidia-experimental-310
[06:39] <histo> quietone: or on battery and only hibernate when battery is below a certain percentage
[06:39] <zorg24> Ben64, ok I'll try that, thanks
[06:39] <Hyperiant> histo, Confuzzled: At this point it seems to make more sense to repartition the drive and reinstall everything, but I don't have an XP install disc, which makes that...problematic, to say the least
[06:39] <Confuzzled> if you use ext3 for your linux root partition, then you would additionally be able to read and modify it from other alternative distros, such as if you need to use a rescue live-cd or something, or even from a mac.
[06:40] <Confuzzled> additionally, you can instal NTFS tools into ubuntu, which will give you (theoretically) the ability to read/write your windoze drive from your linux OS
[06:41] <zorg24> Ben64, thanks a ton because because the drivers from nvidia wanted me to kill x windows server which I was a bit scared to try
[06:41] <izx> How do i fix initramfs error in ubuntu 11.04 ??
[06:41] <histo> Hyperiant: Just put the ubuntu install disk in. It will allow you to resize the XP partition and install ubuntu along side it.
[06:41] <Confuzzled> but be aware that the NTFS tools for linux are in an alpha/pre-release state; so you can fully expect to find some bugs, for which there isn't a fix yet
[06:41] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: ext4 isn't supported by non-Ubuntu distros?
[06:41] <Confuzzled> some
[06:41] <BillyZane2> histo: will, i sorta have it working. but the full desktop isn't running.. i suppose it's something to do with the configuration. it's extremely slow also
[06:41] <izx> How do i fix initramfs error in ubuntu 11.04 ?? Without using a any optical disk / usb ??
[06:42] <Confuzzled> ext4 has additional (better) journaling capabilities, which some older variants have difficulties interpreting links and stuff
[06:42] <ckone> Hi when ubuntu phone os?
[06:42] <histo> BillyZane2: What do you mean the full desktop isn't running?  You are trying to forward an entire DE?
[06:42] <Ben64> !phone | ckone
[06:42] <ubottu> ckone: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[06:42] <Confuzzled> ext4 isn't supported on OS X, either
[06:42] <histo> ckone: end of feb
[06:42] <BillyZane2> histo: yes. there should be a full DE
[06:42] <histo> BillyZane2: use vnc or teamviewer
[06:42] <Confuzzled> some of the lighter-weight older rescue CD ISO's aren't very ext4 - friendly, either
[06:43] <histo> BillyZane2: X forwardign is more for specific apps not an entire desktop. You can run vnc through ssh for more security though.
[06:43] <ckone> Thanks waiting :)
[06:44] <histo> !vnc | BillyZane2
[06:44] <ubottu> BillyZane2: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[06:44] <BillyZane2> histo: i'm in an introductory programming class, they just gave me this login and told me to use X-Win32, through that, i can get an entire DE. however, I feel i should in principal be able to do it through another application. I was able to login, The file manager pops up when I type startkde , however, this is a limited environment. there is very tiny window that pops up, so tiny it's the size of a pill
[06:44] <Confuzzled> hyperiant, your box really won't gain or lose much from the differences between ext3/4 either, and especially not for what I am assuming your uses will be, either
[06:45] <histo> BillyZane2: I thought you were trying to run soem codeblah app?
[06:45] <BillyZane2> it says, unable to launch kwm, it looks like there's already a window manager running, kwm not started
[06:45] <Akiva-Thinkpad> 12.10 shows me a nude picture (from amazon suggestions) when I type store. Should I report this as a bug? Also, how can I get rid of this? This is a fresh install.
[06:45] <Confuzzled> TBH, most of the differences in types of file-systems come out when you're trying to push a high-availability server over a network, in which case you're using specialized hardware, and are moving into things like btrfs, xfs, zfs....
[06:45] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Then...I have an alternative flash drive that's very tiny.  About 1GB.  Is there a distro that can fit on it?  :P
[06:45] <BillyZane2> histo: codeblocks isn't on this server, it's the schools. to get codeblocks running, i wanted to use it from my school by logging on to my home computer
[06:45] <Confuzzled> hyperiant: DSL
[06:45] <dr_willis> Hyperiant:  tinycorelinux
[06:46] <Confuzzled> or puppy linus, slacko linux
[06:46] <histo> BillyZane2: okay ssh -X ip.of.home.computer codeblocks   Run that on the school computer and poof codeblocks will appear
[06:46] <BillyZane2> histo: :D
[06:46] <Confuzzled> what are you tyring to do with the distro on a 1GB thumb drive?
[06:46] <BillyZane2> histo: i was going to see if the school will give me a sub domain. probably not, but worth a try
[06:46] <histo> BillyZane2: assuming you have some form of ssh client on the school computer and an X environment running on that machine also.
[06:46] <Confuzzled> something like that I'd basically reserve for a recovery utility distro
[06:47] <BillyZane2> histo: they have X-win32 on all the computers
[06:47] <histo> BillyZane2: dynamic dns will give you one for free
[06:47] <Confuzzled> and there are plenty of different kinds of those out there
[06:47] <zorg24> hey Ben64 do you know if with that driver I'll be able to switch between the discrete and the onboard (b/c the discrete wrecks the battery life)
[06:47] <BillyZane2> histo: yeah but it wouldn't be as cool. lol. plus, am i really suppose to write down a huge DNS address?
[06:47] <Hyperiant> Confuzzled: Recovery utility primarily, maybe light word processing
[06:47] <histo> BillyZane2: is X-win32 just a X server for windows?
[06:47] <BillyZane2> histo: it's a client i believe
[06:47] <Ben64> zorg24: you'd need something like bumblebee
[06:47] <histo> BillyZane2: no it could be something like billyzane.homeip.net
[06:47] <dr_willis> i use xming as a x server for windows.
[06:47] <Confuzzled> yeah, check out trinity rescue cd,
[06:47] <BillyZane2> oh really?
[06:48] <BillyZane2> histo: how do i do that?
[06:48] <histo> BillyZane2: please pm as this is way offtopic for ubuntu
[06:48] <BillyZane2> ok
[06:48] <Confuzzled> ! Hyperiant: http://distrowatch.com/search.php
[06:48] <zorg24> Ben64, ya... I was just reading a thread saying tha bumblebee doesn't work well on this laptop.... :-(
[06:49] <Confuzzled> use distrowatch to find a distro or two for you to try out on your 1GB USB, and use unetbootin to put it on there.
[06:50] <gnomefreak> does grub support a tri-boot system?
[06:50] <Confuzzled> that way you can retain your 32GB USB for data slavation/storage, and then go wreck your IDE HDD repartitioning to dual-boot distros with
[06:50] <Confuzzled> GRUB2 supports as many booting systems as you can fit on your HDDD
[06:50] <gnomefreak> Confuzzled: cool thanks
[06:50] <Confuzzled> LILO supports 32, I think
[06:51] <gnomefreak> 32? holy crap
[06:51] <Confuzzled> I've gone up to 8 distros using LILO
[06:51] <Confuzzled> personally

[06:53]  * dr_willis ports emacs to grub2
[06:53] <Confuzzled> would anyone know the VESA framebuffer mode for a 1920x1020 resolution with higher than 256 color depth?
[06:54] <Confuzzled> Dr_willis: which is why I prefer LILO - it's simple, and easy, like a bootlader should be
[06:54] <dr_willis>  and has its own set of limitations
[06:55] <Confuzzled> none of which have ever been an issue for me
[06:55] <dr_willis> Confuzzled:  i belive i saw the /etc/default/grub  file coments mention some command to list all supported modes and that info
[06:55] <dr_willis> ;)  vbeinfo  perhaps?
[06:55]  * gnomefreak hates lilo, last time i used it it gave me nothng but trouble
[06:56] <dr_willis> im not even sure how the kernel supports those old mode options any more.
[06:56] <Confuzzled> ubuntu doesn't seem to play well with lilo, which is why I use # other=/dev/sda5 and let Ubuntu have its grub loader just by itself
[06:57] <Confuzzled> old mode options? like 1920x1020x32?
[06:57] <dr_willis> vbeinfo may be a grub command.  the docs  sort of say that.. but its not real clear
[06:58] <dr_willis> get to a grub menu,,, try the  vbeinfo from a grub shell perhaps and see.. im on my phone. :) so cant do it
[06:58] <dr_willis> ive not messed with console/framebuffer modes in years
[06:59] <dr_willis> i was thinking vbeinfo scanned your current hardware and returned what modes it could support
[06:59] <Confuzzled> yeah, but the intel hd video modes aren't always listed as supported, even when they are by the hardware
[07:00] <Confuzzled> i was reading something like that awhile back
[07:00] <Confuzzled> i'd rather just hard-code my video mode into a kernal-mode and fohgettaboutit
[07:01] <Confuzzled> everything would pop up at my lcd's native resolution without fuss
[07:02] <Confuzzled> no need to hve commands being read and interpereted on so many different layers... just keep it all as low-level as possible for maximum efficiency
[07:02] <x_carrey> 我来了。。。
[07:02] <Confuzzled> wow, i didn't even know I had those fonts installed.

[07:12] <Supercomp> how to copy vcds in ubuntu
[07:13] <Confuzzled> alcohol120, handbrake, ffpmpeg
[07:13] <dr_willis> you can use 'dd' to clone  many optical disks
[07:13] <dr_willis> Unless you want to 'rip' the vcd toa video file
[07:14] <dr_willis> been ages since ive seen 'vcd' mentioned. ;)
[07:14] <Confuzzled> is there a reason you want to stick with the VCD format?
[07:14] <Confuzzled> some device compatibility?
[07:14] <Korekame> no dvd drive??
[07:15] <_1_muqingchao> ?
[07:15] <Supercomp> no dvd drive
[07:15] <Korekame> or no blank dvds?
[07:15] <dr_willis> You can play iso files :) no need for a dvd drive...
[07:15] <dr_willis> I have several home tv-media players that can play DVD iso files also.  - makes it handy
[07:15] <Korekame> I never understood why vcd's were so popular on the web
[07:16] <Korekame> it's a horrid format
[07:16] <Supercomp> still many videos come in vcd format
[07:16] <dr_willis> ages ago i recall making/seeing some Vcd(?) that you could boot in a pc and it had a built in player ;) sor tof a  DVD player on a disk.
[07:16] <Confuzzled> then i'd rip an iso of your VCD using a cd-burning program, and if you really wanted needed a duplicate physical copy, use said cd program to make a copy
[07:16] <Supercomp> not able to copy them on to pc
[07:16] <Supercomp> tried vcdrip
[07:17] <Confuzzled> you can copy the image files. use something like K3B or Brasero
[07:17] <dr_willis> Unless theres some sort of copy protection, you should be able to use 'dd' to make a disk image.
[07:17] <dr_willis> !find vcdrip
[07:17] <Korekame> vcd's come with copy protection?
[07:17] <ubottu> Package/file vcdrip does not exist in quantal
[07:17] <Korekame> this I've never seen.
[07:17] <Confuzzled> inorite
[07:17] <dr_willis> No idea.. ive not touched a vcd in years
[07:17] <Korekame> I'm not doubting it, just haven't ever seen it.
[07:18] <Korekame> vcd's are popular on pirate media mostly. I don't even remember any legitimate media in vcd format.
[07:18] <dr_willis> so i imagine theres tools out to convert them, or clone them.. depending on whatg you want to do
[07:18] <dr_willis> id start with just dding one to a file to see if it works
[07:18] <Supercomp> here original media come in VCD
[07:19] <Confuzzled> there's a chance vcdrip might not be interpreting the image correctly. most burning programs try to interpret the data they read off a disc - there are  a few burning programs though that are designed to utilze what's commonly called blind reads/blind writes
[07:19] <Korekame> Supercomp, where is here?
[07:19] <Supercomp> india
[07:19] <Confuzzled> if your disc is scratched or damaged, that could be the case
[07:19] <Korekame> ah, actually, that sort of makes sens.
[07:20] <Korekame> india does have a tendancy to be behind on technology, especially in media.
[07:20] <Confuzzled> much of the media i've purchased near that part of the world was fo questionable legitmacy to begin wiht

I installed a dualboot on an HP laptop for a friend and could not get around this issue
[07:35] <ububh> I'm purging java and apt-get continue to reinstall an alternative, how can I force apt-get to *only* purge my java install?
[07:35] <Supercomp> windows 8 not pretty good hence didnt try
[07:36] <zenu> @Supercomp Is this a problem I should just expect from any Windows 8 installation?
[07:36] <zenu> or has somebody found a work around to it?

[07:36] <Supercomp> i think you should be able to use dual boot if you first install windows and then ubuntu
[07:37] <zenu> The problem is that the system bypasses Grub and defaults to Windows 8
[07:37] <ububh> zenu: is that an issue realted to (U)EFI computer?

[07:44] <Confuzzled> I haven't used winblows since win2K was current and up-to-date, but I remember hearing some scary and nasty things about the so-called secure-boot feature of win8. on BIOS systems, it had to be able to be disabled, but on NON-BIOS systems, it COUULD NOT be disabled
[07:45] <rsser> it is very beautiful
[07:45] <zenu> will those instructions solve Windows 8 being the default OS?
[07:45] <Confuzzled> you might very well be locked into using windoze 8 on that achine
[07:45] <ububh> rsser: lol was for "asking to VinDSL" :D
[07:46] <ububh> Confuzzled: it's just harmless on non-ARM arch and btw Ubuntu has its own verified keys
[07:46] <zenu> its a friend's computer so I don't have to worry too much about it but, wanted to know if there was a better solution I should had used
[07:46] <ububh> Confuzzled: from 12.10 IIRC
[07:46] <Confuzzled> yeah, but if you want to try something outside of Ubuntu? the whole notion is rather offensive to me
[07:47] <kubanc> hellow! are there any setting for powering off monitor in ubuntu 12.10?
[07:47] <zenu> @Confuzzled ??
[07:47] <Confuzzled> power managemnet, kubanc
[07:47] <histo> kubanc: yes power management settings
[07:48] <rsser> ububh, i can't find that wallpaper on that website
[07:48] <Confuzzled> the sort of attck that the 'secure-boot' methodology is designed to prevent against hasn't presented itself 'in the wilds' in some time
[07:48] <rsser> vindsl
[07:48] <kubanc> histo, Confuzzled i only have power window for showing battery status (i have PC) and option suspend when inactive for...
[07:49] <Confuzzled> what WM are you using, kubanc?
[07:49] <zenu> @Confuzzled You would think Microsoft would be trying to attack none (U)EFI computers with viruses if it was important
[07:49] <histo> rsser: i'm looking now
[07:49] <kubanc> Confuzzled, i'm not using any WM. My ubuntu is install directly to hard drive..
[07:50] <Confuzzled> you're using Unity WM, then?
[07:50] <rsser> somsip, what did you mean by "tineye"?
[07:50] <somsip> rsser: it's a image reverse search. Google it. That image is avaiable
[07:50] <cfhowlett> I'm editing my /etc/hosts so I can see blocked sites.  Can someone please run nslookup www.twitter.com and nslookup www.wordpress.com and paste the output, please?
[07:50]  * ububh I wonder why aren't we all linuxers using something cool like rEFIt now that more an more PCs sold ships (U)EFI! ... O.o
[07:51] <histo> rsser: try google image search
[07:51] <histo> rsser: search for liek images
[07:51] <histo> I don't have time right now
[07:51] <ububh> histo: just tried me also... Nothing found :[
[07:52] <Supercomp> skype with bluetooth headset doesn't seem to work in ubuntu
[07:52] <rsser> somsip, it's perfect
[07:52] <rsser> I got what you meant
[07:52] <somsip> rsser: you got it? good
[07:52] <rsser> okay, histo
[07:53] <rsser> yes, somsip
[07:53] <rsser> http://www.tineye.com/search/9879b08345f4ef6d8fb1d99b57f015a7ed526486/
[07:53] <rsser> a lot website with image
[07:54] <ububh> On Ubuntu 12.10 amd64 FireFox is a 32bit version, right? So, I need Java64 for the OS *and* Java32 for the brwoser. Right?
[07:54] <histo> rsser: google image search is the way to go
[07:55] <dr_willis> ububh:  i just install the java using the !java factoid guide and dont have to worry about it
[07:55] <dr_willis> !java
[07:55] <ubottu> To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[07:55] <Supercomp> anybody used skype in ubuntu?
[07:55] <ububh> dr_willis: yup, followed that, but Java isn't working on the browser... :/
[07:56] <ububh> Supercomp: yes, but no with BT headaset
[07:56] <rsser> is there any ubuntu 13.04 alpha version?
[07:56] <zenu> How have you tried installing Java for Firefox?
[07:56] <dr_willis> rsser:  its in testing riught now,  if you ant to be a beta tester
[07:57] <rsser> I'm not a beta tester, dr_willis. But I would like to try
[07:57] <Supercomp> i can see the bluetooth headset work in sound preferences, but doesn't detect in skype
[07:57] <dr_willis> rsser:  expect issues with 13.04 ;)   see #ubuntu+1 for 13.04 support
[07:57]  * ububh better could be Kernel's EFI Stub Loader... Ah...
[07:58] <rsser> ok
[07:58] <gipzo> Hello! What is the best way to copy all files from USB flash drive (it's ext2 partition) to HDD and compress them (tar.gz)? And how could I copy them back?
[07:58] <zenu> gipzo you can use zip and cp for that
[07:59] <zenu> archive manager and nautilus can be used if you like GUIs
[07:59] <gipzo> zenu: I have bootable ubuntu server on that flash, and I want to clone it on different flash
[08:00] <iceroot> gipzo: you want to clone the complete drive with filesystem or just the files itself?
[08:00] <dr_willis> gipzo:  cloneing an install is not the same as  copying files...
[08:00] <helmut_> hi
[08:00] <zenu> Do you mean clone it as a tar.gz or another live iso?
[08:01] <gipzo> If by cloning you mean dd - it is very slow
[08:01] <gipzo> And I have different flash drives with different sizes
[08:01] <gipzo> But size of system files are about 1.2 gigs
[08:02] <gipzo> While flash drives are 8gb and 16 gb
[08:02] <zenu> Is the 16 gb the drive you want to copy to?
[08:03] <gipzo> I want to write script, that will format fresh drive, install grub on it and copy all system files from tar.gz to that flash
[08:03] <gipzo> I have one 16 gb drive with working system
[08:03] <zenu> ok
[08:03] <gipzo> And I will have dozen of fresh usb drives
[08:03] <gipzo> they will be 8 and 16 gigs
[08:04] <gipzo> how to format and install grub i know
[08:06] <gipzo> i want to copy files and compress them into tar.gz file, saving all attributes
[08:07] <photon> Hello I had installed ubuntu with wubi but I was running out of space. So I uninstalled it and burned a copy of ubuntu on a cd and tried to install it with split partition. It was going well but then towards the end it told me that the disk was corrupt
[08:07] <dr_willis> gipzo:  if you want to clone a 16gb usb to other  usb  drives you can do that with dd
[08:07] <photon> and I had partitioned 200GB for it, now when I look at the drive I didn't get back those GBs back
[08:08] <photon> I can't even install Wubi again
[08:08] <photon> I don't know why
[08:08] <dr_willis> wubi installs to some directory on the c:  see if its still there.   I dont recall its name
[08:08] <gipzo> dr_willis: Two 16 gb usb drives could have slightly different sizes
[08:09] <dr_willis> gipzo:   cant say ive ever noticed the issue.
[08:09] <photon> gipzo: Do you know what happened to me?
[08:09] <TakeItEZ> gipzo: use a smaller (8GB) image, write it, resize partition/fs then
[08:09] <zenu> @gipzo my first instinct is to use tar to make the archive and then untar it to the location you want
[08:09] <dr_willis> gipzo:  i cloned a 8gb 'full install' from usb to several differnt hds and usbs then used gparted to fill out the rest of the hd.
[08:09] <gipzo> zenu: will it keep all file attributes (permissions etc.)
[08:10] <dr_willis> gipzo:  or use clonzilla
[08:10] <dr_willis> just copying the files will not make the other disks bootable.. if thats your end goal
[08:10] <gipzo> I have max 2 gb files on 8(16)gb flash drives
[08:11] <gipzo> dd copy all 8 gigs
[08:11] <gipzo> it's 4 times slower
[08:11] <dr_willis> if you are worried about the sizes..  makd a 16gb usb and have the last gb be a swap partition. that way if there is a size issue.. you can easially remake the swap partion and not harm the rest of the installed system
[08:11] <dr_willis> you just have to dd the image to the hard drive once..
[08:11] <dr_willis> then you could be writing it to  3+ usb flash drives  at the same time
[08:11] <Hyperiant> connect #ubuntu-bots
[08:12] <Hyperiant> well that didn't work
[08:12] <gipzo> i can make usb bootable
[08:12] <dr_willis> dont forget to use the bs= option for dd also. ;)
[08:12] <gipzo> with ext2 partition
[08:12] <gipzo> guys, i can't use dd
[08:12] <dr_willis> do what you want then.
[08:12] <gipzo> it's _very_ slow
[08:12] <zenu> brb
[08:13] <dr_willis> sounds like you are not using the bs= option to me
[08:13] <Tuna-Fish> how do I clear the metadata of a broken package?
[08:13] <Tuna-Fish> I explicitly do not want to remove any actual files contained in said package
[08:13] <gipzo> it's not because i'm not using different block size, it's because it will copy all 8 gb, and i need only 2
[08:15] <gipzo> What I want to do: 1. Copy all files from USB and store the in tar.gz file on my HDD. 2. Insert different flash, format it to ext2, install grub on it. 3. Uncompress files from tar.gz to new USB
[08:15] <gipzo> Will that work?
[08:15] <dr_willis> gipzo:    if you can manage the grub part by hand.
[08:16] <dr_willis> i really dont see the point in using ext2. but use whateer you want
[08:16] <gipzo> I found this manual - http://ohhohe.tripod.com/files/linux_usb_flashdrive.pdf
[08:16] <dr_willis> theres clonzilla i belive  that can  auto mate most all of it
[08:16] <gipzo> Why not ext2?
[08:16] <dr_willis> why ext2
[08:17] <gnomefreak> its old
[08:17] <gnomefreak> not as secure as ext4
[08:17] <ray> hello, I bought a conceptronix Express Card for USB 3.0 but it's very unstable, I can't boot from it and copying large amounts of data keeps getting errors at some point and I have to reboot the machine. Anybody here has recommendations on a good USB3.0 express card?
[08:18] <dr_willis> ray:  the one i bought --- dident fit in my pc. ;)
[08:18] <gipzo> It will be used in info-terminals...
[08:18] <ray> dr_willis: expresscards you buy normally for laptops with express-card slots :-)
[08:19] <dr_willis> ray:  mine was for a desktop.. aparently it was for minipcie or somtjhing. ;) the  one slot my video card has covered by its fan.. oh well it was only $15
[08:19] <ray> gnomefreak: why are you saying ext2 is not as secure as ext4? I am not really aware of great security features in ext4?
[08:19] <dr_willis> other desktop is a slim case.. it wwont fit in there either.
[08:20] <ray> dr_willis: did you return it and get a refund?
[08:20] <gipzo> Clonezilla wouldn't work: "The destination partition must be equal or larger than the source one."
[08:20] <dr_willis> ray:  im sure i will find a pc some day to fit it in.
[08:20] <dr_willis> if you just need 2gb.. make a 2gb partion... shrink it down to the minimal size needed.... then clonezilla can copy and enlarge
[08:21] <dr_willis> then again.. does it even need to be enlarged if its juss for a   Koisk
[08:21] <gipzo> 2 gb is only system, I need free space for media
[08:22] <dr_willis> so you could use a 3gb /, then a whatver is left for /data  or whatever you want
[08:22] <dr_willis> so if you image to a 16gb usb you get 13gb for /data   image to a 32gb usb  you have 29gb for /data
[08:23] <dr_willis> dozens of ways to set this stuff up. ;)
[08:24] <gipzo> hm... why not cp or rsync?
[08:24] <Kartagis> can I use my phone to share my cell operator's internet package?
[08:24] <gipzo> I thinks it's easier
[08:24] <gipzo> think*
[08:24] <KayAteChef> Kartagis: Android does it
[08:24] <dr_willis> Kartagis:  i can connect to my cellphones hotspot
[08:24] <Kartagis> I can turn on personal connection
[08:24] <dr_willis> android makes it easy
[08:24] <Kartagis> KayAteChef: what about iOS?
[08:24] <dr_willis> no idea what 'personal connection' is..
[08:25] <KayAteChef> Kartagis: use NAT to share the connection with a network
[08:25] <KayAteChef> use  a Linux computer to pick up the connection with USB or wifi and then route through wifi or Eth
[08:26] <Kartagis> dr_willis: personal connection point I think, I can only translate because the phone isn't in English now
[08:26] <Kartagis> KayAteChef: do you have a guide in mind?
[08:27] <dr_willis> i just enable the wireless-hotspot-teathering feature on my phone. and the linux box (or my tablets) see it as if it was a wireless router.
[08:27] <dr_willis> its how i get books to my Kindle pwoerwhite from work.
[08:27] <rsser> when I grow up, I want to have a room like this ==> http://www.finalarchitecture.com/wp-content/uploads/images/Nice-White-Modern-Living-Room.jpg
[08:27] <rsser> LOL
[08:28] <rsser> it totally clean
[08:28] <Kartagis> dr_willis: I enabled that, but all I got was a 3g modem connection, even though I don't have a 3g modem
[08:29] <kostkon> rsser, nice but off-topic :/
[08:29] <gmg85> hi guys...is there a way of installing the gnome-tweak-tool without installing gnome shell?
[08:29] <gmg85> or a way of changing the fonts and themes without gnome tweak
[08:29] <dr_willis> Kartagis:  i thinksome phones can appear as a modem. if you use a cable.. but im doing this all wirelessly
[08:30] <kostkon> gmg85, try myunity of ubuntu-tweak
[08:30] <basso> gmg85: you can manualy do it in dconf
=== zhurai-tsuki is now known as zhurai
[08:30] <dr_willis> gmg85:  try unsettings  perhaps
[08:30] <gmg85> thanks for all the suggestions guys...let me check them out :)
[08:31] <gnomefreak> ray: i could swear it is, but i never said it was alot more secure
[08:31] <Annette01> this is gonna sound silly but for some reason all my right click bars and drop down menus are going behind all the windows and i haven o idea how to fix this
[08:31] <shock_one> Can somebody write me a message, please? I'm testing some settings.
[08:32] <gnomefreak> Annette01: file a bug on that. it has happened before in another release
[08:32] <aeon-ltd> shock_one: test in a offtopic channel next time
[08:33] <Annette01> i....dont know how to do that gnomefreak, ive literaly ran ubuntu for 20 hours o.o
[08:33] <gnomefreak> Annette01: oh
[08:33] <JernejL_Work> hi guys
[08:33] <JernejL_Work> and gals
=== Exzel is now known as Jack3k3
[08:33] <JernejL_Work> i'm in need of some linux magical help
[08:33] <gnomefreak> !bugs > Annette01
[08:33] <ubottu> Annette01, please see my private message
[08:34] <Annette01> gnomefreak: , is there a way to fix it?
[08:34] <JernejL_Work> i need to get bandwidth info per ip.. something like what iftop does, but have it directed at a screen, and then read that screen's buffer externally
[08:34] <gnomefreak> Annette01: not that i am aware of unless rebooting fixes it
[08:34] <Jack3k3> hi, could someone tell me, if I'm installing ubuntu on a new machine, and i want to leave a partition on the drive for windows 8 install later, should I just create my partition size, and set it to beginning
[08:34] <KayAteChef> !bugs > KayAteChef
[08:34] <ubottu> KayAteChef, please see my private message
[08:34] <Jack3k3> also, do I need to specify a "Mount point" or leave that blank
[08:35] <dr_willis> Jack3k3:  you could make a ntfs and format it now if you wanted
[08:35] <dr_willis> and put it at  /media/WindowsStuffs
[08:35] <Jack3k3> well my issue is that I can only boot via usb on my ubuntu stick
[08:35] <dr_willis> Jack3k3:  you are better off installing windows furst
[08:35] <gnomefreak> Jack3k3: normally best to install windows first
[08:35] <picaroo> Jack3k3: the best thing to do would be to let Windows format the drive first, and leave space for Ubuntu later on, but
[08:36] <penguinman> Jack3k3: generally with dual booting you want to do the windows install first since windows will overwrite your mbr without asking.
[08:36] <picaroo> wow
[08:36] <Jack3k3> so i want to install linux now , leave a partition, for windows, then install windows and reinstall the boot loader
[08:36] <pungi-man> Jack3k3, gnomefreak is correct .....
[08:36] <Jack3k3> right but as long as i boot back in and reinstall the boot loader its not a problem?
[08:36] <dr_willis> windows 7 also sort of likes 2 partitons.
[08:36] <penguinman> yeah, and i'm assuming 8 is the same way
[08:36] <KayAteChef> yeah reinstalling grub is easy
[08:37] <KayAteChef> there are tutorials everywhere
[08:37] <dr_willis>  may be safest to have a large space at the front in a primary, then  a extended with logicals afterwrds for linux
[08:37] <Ben64> Jack3k3: you should really install windows first
[08:37] <pungi-man> Jack3k3, but do this in 2 partitions ..... one for windows and the other for ubuntu/linux
[08:37] <Jack3k3> right my drive is brand new, so i wanted to format one ext4 40gb for linux and leave 80gb to create a partition in for windows later
[08:38] <mech> If i make a driver on one linux machine, can I make install it on another?
[08:38] <parolkar> I am using ubuntu official cloud ami on AWS
[08:38] <gmg85> quick question...does ubuntu use systemd?
[08:38] <Ben64> windows doesn't like installing after ubuntu
[08:38] <TakeItEZ> gmg85: not by default
[08:38] <pungi-man> Jack3k3, do the windows stuff first and then the linux stuff !
[08:39] <penguinman> ubuntu uses upstart, which is a (supposedly) improved sysV init
[08:39] <parolkar> when I try to  mkfs -t ext2 -q /dev/ram1 65m it complains with "filesystem larger than apparent device size"
[08:39] <gmg85> TakeItEZ, damn...ok let me look into alternatives..what does it use in place of systemd?
[08:39] <TakeItEZ> gmg85: upstart
[08:39] <Jack3k3> fuck
[08:39] <Jack3k3> i dont have any way to install windows :[
[08:39] <gmg85> TakeItEZ, nice...thanks
[08:39] <gnomefreak> !grub2 > Jack3k3
[08:39] <ubottu> Jack3k3, please see my private message
[08:39] <penguinman> gmg85: not as fast as systemd but it is still reasonable to change the configs
[08:40] <pungi-man> Jack3k3, buy a windows image file and then install it then download and burn a ubuntu image file and then install it !
[08:40] <picaroo> Jack3k3: why can't you install a trial version of Windows, then install Ubuntu, then just overwrite the Windows install later?
[08:40] <zenu> @Jack3k3 Windows doesn't support dual booting very well. Installing Windows first is the best bet if you want both
[08:40] <parolkar> I am trying to create a ram fs of size larger than 30 Gig (I have that much ram in that machine)
[08:40] <gnomefreak> oh and Jack3k3 please watch your language
[08:40] <gmg85> penguinman, i see..
[08:40] <Jack3k3> my bad, im just frustrated since i only have a 2gb usb and my dvd drive isn't bootable
[08:40] <parolkar> How can I change this limit imposed on mkfs?
[08:41] <mech> If i make a driver on one linux machine, can I make install it on another?
[08:41] <zenu> Jack3k3 would a VM work for what you need to do in Windows?
[08:42] <penguinman> mech: what do you mean by make? as in code it yourself?
[08:42] <Jack3k3> not really, I mean, i'm confused why you guys are making it sound so bad, from everything I'm reading, you essentially need to just boot a live cd in after installing windows to reinstall/fix grub
[08:42] <Jack3k3> if thats all it is, I'm not worried about that
[08:42] <picaroo> Jack3k3: the thing is, there's no guarantee Windows will like what you've prepared for it.
[08:42] <gnomefreak> Jack3k3: we are giving you the easiest way to doing the job that is all
[08:43] <picaroo> It's much more likely Ubuntu will like what Windows prepares for it.
[08:43] <Jack3k3> true
[08:43] <penguinman> windows doesn't play well with others
[08:43] <Jack3k3> well, i need something now, so i'll just install linux, try it with windows and if it fails format the whole thing and install windows first
[08:43] <gmg85>  does anyone know where the upstart config file is located?
[08:43] <Jack3k3> thanks for the info
[08:44] <penguinman> gmg85: it's actually several, most of them located in /etc/init.d/
[08:44] <gmg85> penguinman, thanks
[08:45] <TakeItEZ> gmg85: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook        lots of info on upstart
[08:45] <mech> no, i mean run the make command.  I have a machine with the Realtek 8111e controller and am trying to make the drivers for it, but am running into issues with the make command for it (make[2]: No rule to make target 'clean'), so I want to run it on the one with internet so i can do all the updates instead of guessing what i need for build-essential and move it to the internet-less machine to
[08:45] <mech> install it
[08:45] <zidoh> my laptop seems to sporadically boot with the error "your screen, graphics card, and input device settings could not be detected correctly", making it unable to start gnome.. however, rebooting the computer will usually apparently "fix" the problem.. anybody got a clue what would make this nondeterministic?
[08:45] <picaroo> Jack3k3: I actually just decided to ditch my dual-boot environment - now I use Lubuntu on my host, and I have a guest machine running in Virtualbox which uses Windows XP Pro.
[08:45] <BlackWeb> Just curious when I open up a nautilus window Then it shows Attached Devices; Computer & Network, Which I have NFS Shares mounted and its showing them Under the attached Devices & Computer, But when I click on Devices then it just says that the following is already mounted, Have to click the HardDrive Under Computer, Is there a way to remove it from showing up under Devices? Not really a big deal just a small tweaking issue I guess
[08:46] <picaroo> zidoh: loose cable or connection somewhere?
[08:50] <gmg85> How does one go about solving this problem  "The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:"
[08:50] <gmg85> after an apt-get update
[08:51] <zidoh> picaroo: would have to be inside the laptop then, nothing connected to it.. although it's never a problem in windows, and never a problem after boot.. so it seems kind of weird
[08:51] <penguinman> gmg85: that's probably from a source you manually added yourself
[08:51] <gmg85> penguinman, yes sudo add-apt-repository ppa:tualatrix/ppa
[08:51] <gmg85> there was a problem with the keys..
[08:52] <gmg85> connection refused...
[08:52] <penguinman> gmg85: usually when you add a ppa it will auto add the gpg keys
[08:52] <picaroo> zidoh: where does the error appear?
[08:52] <gmg85> could it be because am behind a proxyed network?

=== c0li is now known as c[0]li
[08:54] <AtumT> apt-get it..?
[08:54] <penguinman> sujon: search for it in the software center, or run the command `sudo apt-get install codeblocks`
[08:54] <sujon> yeah
[08:54] <zidoh> picaroo: on boot, it shows the nvidia splash very briefly, then i get a dialog telling me my system is running in low graphics mode etc.. i press ok and it gives me some options (reconfigure, start terminal etc), but this options menu just hangs, so i have to switch tty to a terminal
[08:55] <gmg85> penguinman, just opened the link https://launchpad.net/~tualatrix/+archive/next
[08:55] <sujon> <penguinman> i looked in the software center it showed me the software but said the package is broken
[08:55] <gmg85> penguinman, how do i proceed from there if you don't mind me asking
[08:55] <penguinman> sujon: do a system update first then
[08:56] <sujon>  <penguinman> how to do that ?  (I am a beginner user)
[08:56] <picaroo> zidoh: I'm not sure.  I suggest you look at the xorg log files to see if it says anything more about what might be failing.
[08:57] <penguinman> sujon: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade in a terminal will do the trick
[08:57] <picaroo> zidoh: they're located at: /var/log/Xorg*
[08:57] <zidoh> picaroo: thanks, will do!
[08:58] <penguinman> gmg85: taking a look right now
[08:58] <picaroo> zidoh: I do know that nvidia graphics cards sometimes have problems...I have an older desktop that has issues with the nouveau drivers, which are the default open-source alternative to the proprietary nvidia drivers

[09:02] <penguinman> gmg85: what that does is manually download the gpg key for the repo and add it to apt's keyring

[09:32] <marenostrum> Hello. Ubuntu 12.04 here, with latest updates and with Firefox 18.0.1: Some minutes ago I was about to write "openjdk" (without quotes) in Firefox searchbar (set to google) to search the Web for it. I was not looking at neither the serachbar nor keyboard while ı was writing. Most probably I wrote the word (openjdk) and hit enter. But surprisingly Ubuntu software center opened showing its openjdk page. Then, when I checked the searchbar I saw that j
[09:32] <marenostrum> ust some portion of the word (openjdk) is there. Any idea? Did I hit something else on the keyboard and what could it be? What's triggering software center via Firefox searchbar? I can't reproduce it with typing any other software/package name. Any idea? Thanks in advance.
[09:34] <dr_willis> tap the alt key and try it marenostrum
[09:34] <dr_willis> alt = the hud. super = the dash
[09:34] <marenostrum> dr_willis, Thanks.
[09:35] <dr_willis> the hud is an often overlooked feature.. you may want to check youtube for hud features videos. ;)  if it was the hud you used
[09:35] <mrshr3d> Hi gotoguy, I'm no expert but don't believe it possible to run something as root without a password.  Would make it too easy for malicious scripts to run on your machine as root without your knowledge
[09:36] <dr_willis> you can set up sudoers to allow running specific apps as root wituout a password
[09:36] <gotoguy_> mrshr3d: I think that's what Set UID flag is for.
[09:36] <dr_willis> and you can set things to be 'suid' to allow them to run as root
[09:36] <dr_willis> so. yes it is possible to set it up.
[09:37] <gotoguy_> dr_willis: suid don't work on my script for some reason, Does suid have to be a program.
[09:37] <gotoguy_> ?
[09:37] <dr_willis> you DONT make SUID scripts
[09:37] <dr_willis> ;)
[09:37] <dr_willis> system wont allow it for scripts. just executables
[09:38] <dr_willis> well binarys
[09:38] <gotoguy_> ahh, okay, I was wondering about that. thanks.
[09:38] <dr_willis> theres perhaps only a few suid binaries on your system also.
[09:38] <dr_willis> the trend over the years have been to remove them as potential security risks as much as possible
[09:39] <gotoguy_> dr_willis: I'll have to take the sudoers approach, I didn't think of that, tanks!

[09:43] <ArchRatio> Hello.
[09:44] <dr_willis> jello
[09:44] <ArchRatio> A few days ago, I tried to install Ubuntu, because I want to learn C, because that's apparently best done on an Unix-based system.
[09:44] <ArchRatio> I had the OS before, but I removed it using some Live CD of an OS with OS removal tools on it.
[09:45] <ArchRatio> So I tried to reinstall it, and it failed to install the bootloader, or at, it prompted me to either skip it, or install it in a different location.
[09:45] <ArchRatio> I did the latter, and the OS itself seems to have installed fine, but I when I boot my PC, it just goes to Windows.
[09:45] <picaroo> Has anyone ever had a problem with xterm replacing single quotes with the 'd' character?  Using Terminus font
[09:45] <ArchRatio> It also told me that there were some changes made to my system or something, and that Windows wanted to restore it, but I just started Windows normally.

=== Guest21169 is now known as fddg
[09:47] <alumno_> WHAT
[09:47] <dr_willis> ArchRatio:  you made a cd and booted the cd and insstalled that way?  or did you use some .exe on the cd to install inside windows
[09:47] <triassic> fddg, install from a USB stick
[09:47] <fddg> i am
[09:47] <ArchRatio> I burned and booted from a CD and installed from there.
[09:47] <fddg> im on the usb right now, i only have the one hdd
[09:48] <fddg> i dont have any cds
[09:48] <dr_willis> ArchRatio:  the check out that fix grub wiki page. the boot-repair tool should let you reinstall grub from the live cd
[09:48] <ArchRatio> It also had some .exe on the CD, but I chose to install it from the Live CD because that's what I was familiar with.
[09:48] <dr_willis> the .exe would be a wubi insgtall.. its best to avoid wubi
[09:48] <triassic> I think Ubuntu pops up a splashscreen with 'install' or 'run'

[09:48] <fddg> why do i bother
[09:49] <ArchRatio> Alright, thanks a lot, will try that.
[09:49] <dr_willis> fddg:  ive seen some windows installs use 4 primary partitions which make it imppssible for the installer to install ubuntu.
[09:49] <triassic> replace the drive
[09:49] <dr_willis> fddg:  check your disk partiton layout to see what you have
[09:49] <triassic> they're cheap
[09:50] <cristian_c> What command must I use from terminal to make the Find box appeared in chromium?

[09:50] <fddg> the hard drive doesnt show up in gparted
[09:50] <triassic> I use gparted whenever I feel the need to know how much disk space is unavailable
[09:51] <dr_willis> fddg:  if gparted or fdisk, or cfdisk dosent see it at all.. thats a deeper issue.
[09:51] <fddg> oh.. :(
[09:52] <dr_willis> fddg:  does 'sudo blkid' see the disk at all?

[09:53] <fddg> thats all i see
[09:53] <dr_willis> so apaently the answer is 'no'  ;)
[09:53] <fddg> so its broken..?
[09:53] <dr_willis> be curious if a 13.04 beta live cd would see it.
[09:53] <MonkeyDust> looks like a hardware issue
[09:53] <dr_willis> could be the hardware is dead.. or some weird ness going on.
[09:54] <fddg> is 13.04 good?
[09:54] <dr_willis> 13.04 is in testing

[09:58] <nukke> how's syslinux compared to grub?
[09:58] <mrshr3d> Thinking of trying Xubuntu myself, my lappie is starting to get on the old and tired side
[09:58] <ArchRatio> My tutorial recommends me I use Ubuntu if I'm using Windows
[09:58] <dr_willis> ArchRatio:  it thsts all you want to do. you could run lubuntu inside virtualbox
[09:59] <iceroot> ArchRatio: doesnt matter
[09:59] <triassic> mrshr3d, you won't regret it
[09:59] <triassic> and on a fast machine, it's even faster!
[09:59] <dr_willis> nukke:  syslinux is radically differnt then grub2
[09:59] <ArchRatio> I have found that using a different OS is great for my focus though
[09:59] <ArchRatio> Since I can't use communication applications I use on Windows without putting in some effort to set them up
[10:00] <dr_willis> ArchRatio:  you could even do a full install to a  decent sided usb flash drive isf all you want  to do is play with the c compiler stuff
[10:00] <ArchRatio> And I really want to be productive, haven't done useful stuff in days
[10:00] <iceroot> ArchRatio: and ubuntu is not based on unix
[10:01] <ArchRatio> EVERYTHING I KNOW IS A LIE
[10:01] <ArchRatio> Or was it Linux-based systems?

[10:08] <dr_willis> xkernel:  you mean the top right indicator-applets?
[10:08] <xkernel> dr_willis, yes

[10:09] <xkernel> dr_willis, before there was gnome-applet which you can kill to reload all applets again

[10:17] <picaroo> Would gnome-terminal work if I'm not using gnome?
[10:17] <martin___> rxvt or lxterminal is quite good :)
[10:17] <dr_willis> you dont need to use gnome for gnome apps to work

[10:25] <__Hackuin__> martin___: terminator pwn's all :P
[10:25] <dr_willis> ill stick with newer ones..
[10:25] <dr_willis> terminator uses gnome-terminal
[10:25] <kostkon> __Hackuin__, terminator is cool yes
[10:25] <martin___> Let me rephrase it, I still think it's good anywho :)
[10:26] <__Hackuin__> My official life would be like hell without terminator.
[10:26] <antonio__> monkeydustL I think my torrent program screwed it up
[10:28] <kostkon> antonio__, just do a regular download then, go to releases.ubuntu.com, get the url and just use wget:  wget url-of-iso
[10:28] <gmg85> upstart job starts when i run the start command but won't start on startup
[10:28] <gmg85> any idea why?
[10:30] <gmg85> there was no job named startup under /etc/init so i switched to start on lightdm ...that dont work either
[10:31] <dr_willis> so you made a /etc/init.d/somthing.conf for the job?
[10:31] <gmg85> dr_willis, yes
[10:31] <dr_willis> compare it to one that works ;)
[10:31] <gmg85> dr_willis, just changed something ....let me reboot and see if it helps..will try that too :)
[10:35] <spikey> hi, question for you: do you know where the dock's icons of unity are installed on file system ?
[10:35] <vmachine> do i have to restart networking server for ubuntu to use the local host file after changes have been made?
[10:36] <vmachine> *service
[10:36] <iceroot> vmachine: no
[10:36] <vmachine> hmm well its not using the entry i made int  /etc/hosts
[10:37] <iceroot> vmachine: you want to change your hostname?
[10:37] <iceroot> vmachine: or you want to setup a entry so that a ping on "foobar" will result in the ip from the hosts file?
[10:37] <vmachine> yes
[10:37] <iceroot> vmachine: that was not a yes/no question
[10:38] <vmachine> yes i want ubuntu to use the host file for resolutions
[10:38] <iceroot> vmachine: that will work directly without restarting
[10:38] <iceroot> vmachine: ping the new entry and it should use the new ip
[10:39] <iceroot> vmachine: when you used the correct syntax in /etc/hosts
[10:39] <iceroot> vmachine: ip hostname

[10:43] <TakeItEZ> i guess he doesn't care if you can remove it or not. it is there by default and that is... odd
[10:44] <dr_willis> the whole lens/scope system is a work in progress.. so its  got to have time to mature
[10:44] <TakeItEZ> dr_willis: point is: do people really want this?
[10:44] <dr_willis> i want to search just askubuntu,com  from the help lens but cant seem to do tghat either. that has mor eaffect on me then the amazon suggestions
[10:45] <dr_willis> TakeItEZ:  they dont seem to mind the 10x worse ssituation on  the android  market. and i imagine apple and w8 have it even worse
[10:45] <TakeItEZ> dr_willis: linux != android
[10:45] <dr_willis> and  they are expanding the lens feature in the next release so its pointless to speculate on it
[10:46] <dr_willis> ubuntu is taking ideas from android.. and android  update on my phone is makign it more like ubuntu/linux
[10:46] <TakeItEZ> dr_willis: question is, will people accept that or will they switch distro (like they do if they dislike wallpapers)

[11:39] <famax8bis> i know for broadcom u got a third party driver that works, and it is not categorized as such, u should ave an option called @third aprty drivers@ and install those it should work
[11:40] <famax8bis> here on the caht?
[11:41] <MonkeyDu1t> famax8bis  th url yes
[11:42] <antonio__> this is so damn annoying
[11:42] <famax8bis> but pastebinit?? where do i find this shall i dl and install that first???
[11:42] <antonio__> monkeydult: have you actually gotten a broadcom to work?
[11:42] <antonio__> Module build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the
[11:42] <antonio__> kernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed.
[11:42] <MonkeyDu1t> antonio__  i don't need/use wireless, find general instructions in the ubottu link
[11:43] <famax8bis> " antonio: as i said just install all drivers possible from ubuntu and it shall work, i did it with my previous laptop and it worked, worst case wire it and download all the other drivers existing - wort case, backtrack has a larger library of drivers and they sure work !!
[11:44] <antonio__> how do I install them?
[11:44] <MonkeyDu1t> famax8bis  yes, install pastebinit, then enter the command in a terminal and paste the url here in the channel
[11:45] <antonio__> "Note: If you see the message "Module build for the currently running kernel was skipped since the kernel source for this kernel does not seem to be installed" then you are missing the appropriate generic linux-header package(s)."

[12:05] <famax8bis> but here it say "no -l found"
[12:05] <babilen> famax8bis: What caused that output? "here" ? Have you installed Ubuntu already?
[12:06] <famax8bis> auronandace: does that mean i can directly create the right partiton? i always first made it fat 32 then when i install i change it for whatever it tells me to
[12:06] <dr_willis> gparted lets you make whatever you want. ;)
[12:06] <famax8bis> babiln: nope is not installed yet
[12:07] <babilen> famax8bis: So what gave you the output you pasted?
[12:07] <famax8bis> the command line given earlier @ babilen
[12:08] <famax8bis> babilen: sudo fdisk -l
[12:09] <babilen> famax8bis: That command needs an argument. Try "sudo -l /dev/sda" (if applicable) -- Are you /trying/ to install Ubuntu already?
[12:10] <dziegler> Hi is it possible to see the kernel messages and the splash screen on booting my pc? I remember ther was a way in Kubuntu hardy but i dont know in newer versions. I only can see my splash or the kernel messages...
[12:11] <dr_willis> dziegler:  not that i know of.
[12:11] <famax8bis> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569401/
[12:11] <babilen> famax8bis: And "fdisk -l" /should/ work, but simply list information about ever block device. Could you paste your exact command and its output to a pastebin? (just copy the entire terminal content)
[12:11] <dr_willis> it got decided that kernel messages where to confuseing to beginners. ;) so they are all hidden by the splash screen
[12:11] <babilen> famax8bis: Please include your exact command. Also /where/ are you executing these commands. AFAIK you haven't installed any Linux yet and are just making this up ;)
[12:12] <famax8bis> babilen: i tried already to install it but couldnt see it after reboot so i formatted again
[12:12] <asilhouette> my software updater doesn't work anymore. using the software updated does nothing. Any ideas anyone
[12:12] <kostkon> dziegler, you can just open up your kernel or boot log files,  /var/log/kern.log  /var/log/boot.log respectively
[12:12] <asilhouette> updater*
[12:12] <auronandace> famax8bis: are you booting the right disk from bios?
[12:12] <asilhouette> i'm using synaptic to update though.
[12:12] <famax8bis> babilen: it is not installed anymore - if you mean i never installed linux ever before then no i run already 2 slax and 1 ubuntu
[12:13] <dziegler> dr_willis kostkon: i know, but in hardy ther was a way to display the splash and the kernel msg on start up. Like this: http://www.mymac.com/img/features/boot1-6-11-06.jpg sorry it was the only picture i found...
[12:13] <babilen> famax8bis: I am not closely familiar with Ubuntu's installer (I am a Debian person), but that sounds as if you forgot to install the bootloader (i.e. grub) to the MBR (if this is a non-EFI setup)
[12:13] <famax8bis> @auronandace: is a dual boot that i am trying to do
[12:13] <auronandace> famax8bis: with 2 separate disks, are you booting the right disk?
[12:13] <famax8bis> guys wait hard drive is toatlly empty is no more anything on it zero nada niets
[12:14] <asilhouette> famax8 use grub boot disk to fix the mbr
[12:14] <famax8bis> auronandace: yes 2 disks but i now erased it all to do it again
[12:14] <babilen> auronandace: That shouldn't make a difference if famax8bis installed the bootloader managed by Ubuntu to the disk (s)he is booting from (typically /dev/sda)
[12:15]  * babilen still does not understand which command causes http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569368/ and why that is of any relevance to the installation at all. I would also still like to see the output (and command) of "fdisk -l /dev/sda" (and /dev/sdb if applicable)
[12:15] <kostkon> dziegler, that was before plymouth. but check this post here: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/kubuntu-users/2012-June/056698.html
[12:15] <famax8bis> babilen: is @sudo fdisk -l/dev/sda
[12:16] <babilen> famax8bis: The command is "fdisk -l /dev/sda" and not "fdisk -l/dev/sda" (note the space between -l and /dev/sda)

[12:17] <dziegler> no, i want booth, splash and kernel msg li in the screen i posted -> http://www.mymac.com/img/features/boot1-6-11-06.jpg
[12:18] <palmfacegirl> i got ubuntu to install but i think its like.. errored or something.. it took a long time to start and theres lots of graphical glitches
[12:18] <babilen> famax8bis: Make sure to install the bootloader to the disk you are booting from
[12:18] <kostkon> dziegler, oh right sorry. i'll say that's currenly impossible
[12:18] <famax8bis> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569438/
[12:18] <dziegler> kostkon, yes i think so
[12:19] <auronandace> famax8bis: your pastebins make no sense
[12:19] <babilen> famax8bis: paste your command too! The entire shell session, like here: http://paste.debian.net/228530/ (that way I can help you)
[12:19] <auronandace> famax8bis: include everything in the pastebin
[12:19] <babilen> (haven't we been over this already?)
[12:19] <famax8bis> babilen: yes this i remember i shouldnt fail on that part... (i said shouldnt ^^ )  - tho it says sdb not found - it is not mounted as i can not mount it "unautothirzed"
[12:20] <famax8bis> how do i include everything? i just enter the command line with pastebinit at the end
[12:20] <palmfacegirl> is there a way i can repair ubuntu
[12:20] <auronandace> famax8bis: show us exactly how
[12:20] <babilen> famax8bis: You have no graphical interface?
[12:21] <dziegler> kostkon, hm i liked this feature... ok so i will activat only the kernel messages without splash, but thanks :-)
[12:21] <famax8bis> as i hace been told earlier: "sudo fdisk - l /dev/sdb|pastebinit"
[12:21] <gnomefreak> famax8bis: save it to a file and pastebinit the file
[12:21] <famax8bis> babilen: i do have one yes
[12:21] <babilen> famax8bis: The command is "fdisk -l /dev/sdb|pastebinit" (note the lack of a space between - and l !)
[12:22] <babilen> famax8bis: Then why can't you simply copy the content of your terminal and paste it to a pastebin? You don't have to use pastebinit as you can paste directly ...
[12:22] <kostkon> dziegler, np
[12:22] <palmfacegirl> anyonne?
[12:22] <famax8bis> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1569465/
[12:22] <palmfacegirl> is there a repair ubuntu command?
[12:22] <famax8bis> no sdb found still the same
[12:22] <palmfacegirl> stuff it ill try mint
[12:22] <babilen> famax8bis: I give up
[12:22] <fidel> !details | palmfacegirl
[12:22] <ubottu> palmfacegirl: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[12:22] <gnomefreak> repair?
[12:22] <auronandace> famax8bis: seriously, i think you are trolling
[12:23] <famax8bis> auronandace: haha im sorry is my first time having an issue and coming here and i dont get the pastebin thingy? will it generate itself the link?
[12:23] <babilen> famax8bis: ping me once you managed to come up with a sensible and comprehensible description of that /actual/ error you are facing and /complete/ commands+output in a pastebin
[12:23] <gnomefreak> auronandace: i doubt he is
[12:24] <babilen> famax8bis: Just select whatever you want to paste in your terminal (as you /are/ using a graphical interface and go to http://paste.debian.net, http://refheap.com or whatever pastebin you like)
[12:24] <auronandace> famax8bis: what is so difficult: sudo fdisk -l (then copy the output to pastebin.com)
[12:24] <babilen> You can paste your selection with a middle-mouse click or use right-click → copy and right-click → paste
[12:25] <famax8bis> auronandace: i didnt know about the whole pastezone and so on i told you first time on irc chat and having troubles with linux sorry
[12:25] <gnomefreak> famax8bis: is there something you do not understand about using pastebin? or the command itself?

[12:27] <gnomefreak> the facts get much longer we are going to have to pastebin them
[12:27] <babilen> You do not need to use pastebinit /if/ you are working in a graphical environment as you can select text and paste it /directly/ -- pastebinit, nopaste and other tools are meant to be used if you are working at the console (because you cannot access X for example)
[12:27]  * babilen strongly recommends to use nopaste in lieu of pastebinit, but well ...
[12:28] <bogo__> hiu guys... :)
[12:28] <apos> whatevers clever
[12:28] <bogo__> *hi
[12:28] <famax8bis> http://paste.debian.net/228531
[12:28]  * gnomefreak wonders if he has pastebinit installed or if he even has the conf file for it
[12:28] <auronandace> famax8: type?
[12:28] <famax8bis> gnomefreak: yes it is installed - thank you for the quick tuto i didnt know it was possible at all
[12:29] <bogo__> quick question...were can i get the ubuntu mobile os from? :(
=== Kneferilis__ is now known as Kneferilis
[12:29] <babilen> famax8bis: The command is "sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb" ... there is no command "type" that is the verb (as in speaking to each other, communication) "to type"
[12:29]  * babilen gives up
[12:29] <auronandace> famax8bis: can't you read what we are telling you to do?
[12:29] <apos> what filesystem is sdb using?
[12:29] <gnomefreak> why is there  type?
[12:29] <MonkeyDu1t> !phone | bogo__ ask here
[12:29] <ubottu> bogo__ ask here: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[12:29] <babilen> famax8bis: Simply run "sudo fdisk -l" and paste its output
[12:29] <famax8bis> ok just sudo fdisk -l ?
[12:29] <apos> yes
[12:30] <gnomefreak> famax8bis: dont type the " in command
[12:30] <apos> and paste the result
[12:30] <babilen> gnomefreak: right :)
[12:30] <Zenger> Hi guys, I have made a big mistake "sudo chmod 0777 ~/ -R", I started having problems with different notices, and I "sudo chmod 0755 ~/ -R" and "sudo chown myself ~/" but still getting errors, and some software isn't working :(
[12:31] <Zenger> how can I reset the privs on my home folder ?
[12:31] <Kartagis> Zenger: by re-installing
[12:31] <famax8bis> http://paste.debian.net/228532/
[12:31] <Zenger> Kartagis: re-installing the whole os ?
[12:31] <gnomefreak> pretty much
[12:31] <babilen> Zenger: restore from backups
[12:31] <Kartagis> yep
[12:31] <Zenger> what if I create a new user
[12:31] <babilen> famax8bis: congratulations!
[12:31] <apos> sudo chown you.you /home -Rv
[12:31] <Zenger> then give him rights
[12:32] <Zenger> and switch to it
[12:32] <Kartagis> or what babilen said, if applicable
[12:32] <famax8bis> babilen: :P
[12:32] <Azmuthy> hello,i have a problem my ubuntu recognize only 2gb ram while i have 3gb ram ?
[12:32]  * gnomefreak wonders if anyone remembers the question
=== lrandomx is now known as simpledot
[12:32] <palmfacegirl> am i better off getting 64 or 32 bit distributions?, my laptop is an i7 with 8 gigs of ram i believe?
[12:32] <Kartagis> Zenger: if sudo doesn't work, can you create a user?
[12:32] <Kartagis> palmfacegirl: 32
[12:32] <kostkon> palmfacegirl, 64
=== MonkeyDu1t is now known as MonkeyDust
[12:32] <kostkon> :/
[12:32] <Zenger> Kartagis: I did sudo chmod on my home folder
[12:33] <Zenger> not on my whole root
[12:33] <Zenger> I have privs and sudo is working
[12:33] <bogo__> anyone? :-/
[12:33] <fidel> palmfacegirl: 64 should cause no problems nowadyas
[12:33] <babilen> famax8bis: Ok, looks as if your partitioning worked. Just make sure to install the boot loader (grub) to /dev/sda (and not /dev/sdb or some partition (/dev/sda1 or anything with a number at the end)) during the installation
[12:33] <Kartagis> Zenger: oh, then I guess you could create a new user and so on
[12:33] <Zenger> that said I think apos is right
[12:33] <Mathias> is it possible to install ubuntu on another harddrive than the main disk? i'm thinking about installing it on a harddrive and stick it into another machine
[12:33] <famax8bis> babilen: but why cant i see then that disk in the installation and why cant i monut it?
[12:33] <babilen> palmfacegirl: I'd recommend amd64 (i.e. 64bit)
[12:34] <Kartagis> Zenger: I must have misread, sorry
[12:34] <Zenger> Kartagis: no worries mate
[12:34] <Zenger> I have done that mistake of changing the whole root
[12:34] <gnomefreak> palmfacegirl: doesnt really  matter i have both 32 and 64 and they run fine
[12:34] <Zenger> won't do it again :D
[12:34] <famax8bis> depends on yourprocessor architecture
[12:34] <simpledot> can i disable the unity launcher bar?
[12:34]  * Kartagis shivers
[12:34] <palmfacegirl> im getting very mixed signals here
[12:34] <palmfacegirl> lol
[12:35] <gnomefreak> simpledot: not sure you can
[12:35] <huttan> palmfacegirl: if you have over 4GB ram u should use 64bit
[12:35] <apos> Mathias,  yes you can install to anything any where, just make sure your boot loader (grub) is installed to the boot device
[12:35] <huttan> palmfacegirl: as a 32bit system cant support more than that
[12:35] <Kartagis> simpledot: yeah, log out and log in with cairodock (install it first)
[12:35] <Zenger> actually more than 3.25
[12:35] <babilen> famax8bis: btw, what is the fat32 on /dev/sda for? I believe that your mistake was that you installed the bootloader to /dev/sdb and not /dev/sda (or some partition)
[12:35] <simpledot> Kartagis, i dont want cairodock either

=== pug is now known as Guest7251
[12:35] <Zenger> okay apos gonna reboot :)
[12:35] <auronandace> babilen: hence why i asked if he was booting the right disk from bios
[12:36] <apos> his problem was he cant mount after partitioning
[12:36] <babilen> auronandace: and rightfully so
[12:36] <Kartagis> simpledot: okay then
[12:36] <famax8bis> babilen : the fat 32 is just because i always did like tis so far since an old issue few years ago, but the problem is more that i now can not mount the disk and see them when i try to install
=== versi is now known as kalkov
[12:37] <Mathias> apos: it has to be done withing windows, unfortunately
[12:37] <babilen> famax8bis: You don't need that fat32 at the beginning -- Are you using it for anything or is it just empty/unused space at the beginning?
[12:37] <Laura--> Hi all.. dumb question: Where's the "Edit" menu for RythmBox?  I keep seeing references that I need to edit my plugins, but can't find the darn Edit menu
[12:37] <Mathias> within*
[12:37] <babilen> Laura--: Select (a) song(s) and right click on them?
[12:38] <ankr> Just installed 12.04 and I am not very fond of the Alt+Tab applicaton-switcher, which now works very much like the one in OSX. Is there any way to get the old behavior back?
[12:38] <Azmuthy> my ubuntu only show 2gb ram instend of 3gb ram ???
[12:38] <apos> Mathias,  im not understanding? ypu can install linux to any device and still dual boot. if your intention is to use the drive in other computers as well, you can also install grub to that drive and it will swap out and run on any machine any time without issue
[12:38] <babilen> Laura--: Ah, that would be "Properties" -- The "Edit" menu is at the top (between "Music" and "View"
[12:38] <famax8bis> it is not installed - when i boot otherwise it boots on the windows hd first or the usb key as i tell it to do when i try to install
[12:39] <dr_willis> ankr:  you can use the ccsm tool to tweak compiz settings. theres alternative alt-tab things in ccsm
[12:39] <huttan> Azmuthy: pastebin cat /proc/meminfo
[12:39] <dr_willis> !ccsm
[12:39] <ubottu> To enable advanced customization of desktop effects in Ubuntu: install 'compizconfig-settings-manager' (or 'simple-ccsm' for pre-Oneiric). If you install the latter, a new option will appear in your appearance properties - See also !compiz - Help in #compiz
[12:39] <babilen> famax8bis: What do you use /dev/sdb1 for (the fat32 one) ?
[12:39] <apos> famax8bis,  do you have gparted and all its extras installed?
[12:40] <ankr> dr_willis, thanks alot - I will take a look :)
[12:40] <famax8bis> g parted: yes all extras - not sure -
[12:40] <Mathias> apos: i have swapped disks and stuff before, but then i installed from a cd. i have to install it to disk, in windows. (i might end up creating 3 partitions, putting the installer on one and making it bootable, then install it from the installer on the second and remove the third and expand the second)
[12:40] <Azmuthy> huttan:http://pastebin.com/jCwdquLr
[12:40] <babilen> famax8bis: Either way: You can (as root!): "mkdir /target" then mount your Ubuntu's root partition with "mount -t FILESYSTEM /dev/sdb2 /target" (replace FILESYSTEM with ext3 or ext4 or whatever you used". Continue with "mount -t proc none /target/proc ; mount -t sysfs none /target/sys" then chroot into your Ubuntu with "chroot
[12:41] <apos> Mathias,  what do you mean install it in windows? you meen wubi?
[12:41] <babilen> famax8bis: Then chroot into your Ubuntu with "chroot /target" and reinstall and configure grub with "update-grub2 ; grub-install /dev/sda"
[12:41] <famax8bis> babilen: so manually mounting it will do?
[12:41] <huttan> Azmuthy: How are u running ubuntu? not virtualized or anything right?
[12:41] <Mathias> apos: doesn't wubi mess with windows' bootloader?
[12:42] <babilen> famax8bis: You can probably also use something like https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[12:42] <famax8bis> babilen: target=sdb1 or 2 or 3?
[12:42] <apos> Mathias,  wubi installs linux as if it is a windows application
[12:42] <babilen> famax8bis: It should if you have a valid filesystem there and Ubuntu is still installed
[12:42] <Azmuthy> huttan:no i am not running it in any virtualmachine
[12:42] <Laura--> babilen: So I don't see Properties or Edit, either?  I have a "Rythmbox" title bar, play/pause/etc below it.. Library down the left, and an Artist/Album region
[12:42] <babilen> famax8bis: /target is /target nothing else. You /do not/ replace /target in those commands
[12:42] <famax8bis> babilen: ubuntu is not installed yet grub will do its job whne i do i guess as usual
[12:43] <babilen> Laura--: Hmm, that sounds as if you are missing some controls :)
[12:43] <ubuntuw1204> need help with my wifi card
[12:43] <babilen> Laura--: Might be "party mode" -- Lets see if I can figure it out how to get it back. One second please.
[12:43] <Mathias> apos: that would be bad for the main computer then, since it's only going to be used for installation
[12:43] <ubuntuw1204> its not working
[12:43] <babilen> famax8bis: Well /then install Ubuntu/ !

[12:44] <ubuntuw1204> wifi card is usb type
[12:44] <ubuntuw1204> model is netgear
[12:44] <Mathias> i'm trying to find a way of installing ubuntu from windows to an external drive
[12:44] <ubuntuw1204> what to do
[12:44] <Gerowen> Where is grub's menu.lst file located at now?
[12:44] <babilen> ubuntuw1204: Is it hanging out on the couch while it eats all your pizza? (i.e. "Would you be so kind to provide more information? For example paste the output of "lspci -nn|grep -i network" and "iwconfig" to http://paste.debian.net)
[12:45] <babilen> ubuntuw1204: Oh, make that "lsusb" if it is an USB one
[12:45] <kelvinella> hi
[12:45] <babilen> Either way: I am out of here
[12:45] <babilen> good luck all!

[12:46] <Gerowen> What's the best way to edit grub menu entries in Ubuntu 12.10?  I've noticed there is no /boot/grub/menu.lst file any more.
[12:46] <PatrickDickey> !grub | Gerowen
[12:46] <ubottu> Gerowen: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[12:46] <kelvinella> hi
[12:46] <PatrickDickey> Gerowen: it's in /etc/default/grub if I remember correctly. But, it's been a while since I've done it.
[12:47] <MonkeyDust> Gerowen  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2
[12:47] <famax8bis> babilen: i think i will just make on big ext4,install again and see if it works this time ^^ and i should put the grub on the same disk and change the bios to be safe right?
[12:47] <babilen> ubuntuw1204: Don't take it personally, but I had enough of support in #ubuntu for today. I am also not involved in Ubuntu and does not use it, so I am not really qualified to help. (I am a Debian Maintainer, and Debian does things slightly different)
[12:47] <Gerowen> Thanks everybody!
[12:47] <ubuntuw1204> babilen: are you on #debian also
[12:47] <babilen> famax8bis: You should put grub on whatever disk you boot from (presumably /dev/sda) which is not necessarily the disk you install Ubuntu on (but might be)
[12:48] <Mathias> apos: nvm, a friend of mine is loaning me a computer :)
[12:48] <apos> Mathias,  thats not really going to work. best i can recommend is turn the drive into a linux live disk with persistence, which is not the best way to do it but it will work. use windows disk managment to make a small partition for the live ISO, leave the rest unpartitioned. use a seperate live disk to boot the PC and partition the rest of the drive as ext2 and label that partition caper then delete the casper file on the windows formatte
[12:48] <apos> d partition
[12:48] <babilen> ubuntuw1204: Yes, #debian is my home :)
[12:48] <famax8bis> babilen: ok sound will do it then
[12:49] <Mathias> apos: i got two locked up computers (they can't boot from anything else than internal hdd and NIC)
[12:49] <PatrickDickey> babilen: Did you ever figure out how to get Rhythmbox out of party mode for Laura--?
[12:49] <apos> Mathias,  forgot to mention to use linux live usb creator to make the windows partition into the linux live drive
[12:49] <babilen> PatrickDickey: Oh, good point.
[12:49] <babilen> Laura--: Forgive me please, one second.
[12:50] <simpledot> Laura--, what plugin does it say that you want to edit?

[12:50] <apos> Mathias,  using that method i described you can make a hard drive that boot the computer and make the installation possible
[12:50] <huttan> Azmuthy: sorry got a phone call
[12:50] <huttan> Azmuthy: been trying to google some on what can cause this, im not really sure. Sorry :(
[12:51] <babilen> Laura--, PatrickDickey: You can switch between Party and non-Party mode with F11, but that is not what causes the controls to be missing. I am not entirely sure what caused this and would have to investigate a bit longer.
[12:51] <Laura--> simpledot: I wanted to turn off that "growler" notification that pops up, and everyone online mentions an "Edit -> Plugins" menu.  But I can't find it for the life of me!  :)

[13:04] <apos> ubuntuw1204,   run a search for that and you will find the answer.   i made a mistake in an earlier post. Ralink RT3072 is what i would recommend you purchase as it will work on any computer out of the box regardless of the OS. no muss no fuss. the one you have is a REAL hassle. $13 is cheaper than the time it will take to fix ur current card.

[13:12] <cfhowlett> danie552, and ... ?

[13:12] <danie552> He gets in the start a blue screen saying there are a couple of tests running. After that the screen goes black.
[13:12] <danie552> And it stays black.
[13:12] <apos> david__,  the best distro is Ubuntu Studio

[13:12] <ubottu> danie552,: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter

[13:13] <lasers> danielbauwens: I like biebian distro.
[13:13] <blami> david__: hard to say, depends on your needs

[13:14] <apos> famax8bis,  i have the fealing you have made a mistake somewhere
[13:14] <cfhowlett> david__, depends on what you want to do, on your hardware and on your breadth of knowledge...
[13:14] <apos> david__,  the best distro is Ubuntu Studio

[13:15] <iceroot> david__: then install another DE
[13:15] <blami> david__: I was into hc distros like those with userbase of five developers. Now I use ubuntu because it looks good and works out of the box, is backed by company that can provide support and convince OEMs but developed by community.

[13:15] <TomyLobo> awesome
[13:16] <blami> david__: install ubuntu without unity then. You can compile android in any linux but I recommend Ubuntu as I believe google uses slightly modified version of Ubuntu internally

[13:20] <IrcDroidClient> how to install ubuntu on android phone
[13:20] <cfhowlett> #phone|IrcDroidClient,
[13:20] <famax8bis> apos: nope cant see the HD at install still the same appearing - monted or not
[13:20] <apos> danielbauwens,  have you verified the checksum to make sure that boot disk actually works?
[13:20] <cfhowlett> !nomodeset|danielbauwens should work
[13:20] <ubottu> danielbauwens should work: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[13:21] <TomyLobo> cfhowlett, i somehow dont think that helped the droid guy
[13:21] <danielbauwens> But the laptop doesn't have ubuntu on it yet.
[13:21] <danielbauwens> It's using windows.
[13:21] <apos> famax8bis,  what is that fat32 partition for? i'd like to erase the drive and repartition it
[13:22] <cfhowlett> danielbauwens, wait you get black screen without ubuntu?
[13:22] <famax8> apos: is doen already just one ext4 and a swap
[13:22] <apos> danielbauwens,  have you verified the checksum of the ISO you downloaded?
[13:22] <famax8> apos: it just doesnt see the hd when i open the install application
[13:23] <danielbauwens> cfhowlett: Yes, it's in windows and when started up it first goes to a blue screen which says a few tests have to be done and then it goes black.
[13:23] <apos> famax8,  yes, something is wrong with the partition, i think it should be redone
[13:23] <scristopher> thanks vlaca
[13:23] <famax8> <apos> so again reformat in ext4 and a swap?
[13:23] <scristopher> that did it
[13:23] <vlaca> scristopher: yw
[13:23] <cfhowlett> danielbauwens, this would seem to be a hardware issue and we arent' going to be able to fix that here.  Suggest you get a consider getting a new screen
[13:23] <scristopher> super derp moment there
[13:24] <cfhowlett> danielbauwens, or something.  Solve the HW issue then do an ubuntu install
[13:24] <apos> famax8,  my understanding was you have a fat32 first then an ext4, then a swap
[13:24] <apos> danielbauwens,  have you verified the checksum of the ISO you downloaded?
[13:24] <famax8> danielbauwens: try windows first with an external screen on vga and hotkey the switch between the screens see if it works
[13:25] <famax8> <apos> no just a ext4 and a swap at the begin - fat32 is gone as per required
[13:25] <danielbauwens> But the screen isn't broken since there comes the blue screen with text.
[13:25] <apos> danielbauwens,  what did you use to make the boot disk? did you verify its checksum to ensure its not bad? what happens from the moment you press the power button?
[13:25] <cfhowlett> danielbauwens, if windows won't boot without issues, then you have definite problems to solve before you tackle ubuntu
[13:26] <apos> famax8,  it would help if i knew what you did from the begining.
[13:26] <danielbauwens> It wont boot into windows, it stays a while on this blue screen, then it goes black and it stays like that.
[13:26] <palmfacegirl> is there a task manager
[13:26] <palmfacegirl> for ubuntu
[13:27] <danielbauwens> And you only get the blue screen back if you push the power button.

[13:43] <crocket> apos : I'm going to try ubuntu studio for my new laptop.
[13:43] <compdoc> webfox, have you added nics? was it ever working?
[13:44] <apos> famax8,  format the drive to your needs, close gparted, run the Ust installer, "choose something else" use the ext4 partition as "/" and the swap as swap. make sure grub is being loaded to your windows hard drive (the boot drive)
[13:44] <webfox> compdoc, yes, it was working. I just changed network from home to oficce. Maybe from eth2 to eth3.
[13:45] <craigbass1976> I can't deal with Unity.  Is there a guide somewhere (wheelchair accessible -- I'm very numb to new desktops) to help me migrate from GNOME2 (or actually a heavily customized XFCE that acts like GNOME2) to unity?
[13:45] <cfhowlett> meet, screencloud.  It's in software center
[13:46] <compdoc> webfox, open this file: /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
[13:46] <cfhowlett> craigbass1976, you can install xfce, kde or just about any other desktop environment and use that instead of unity.  I'm unaware of a published migration guide.
[13:46] <apos> craigbass1976,  you can install whatever window manager you want from ubuntu software center. i recommend xfce4
[13:47] <famax8> <apos> doesnt allow me to put the swap as logical...
[13:47] <apos> famax8,  thats alright
[13:48] <apos> i personally dont even have a swap partition
[13:48] <famax8> <apos> installer launched option picked - next?
[13:49] <apos> make sure grub is going to the boot drive and you should be good to go
[13:49] <famax8> <apos> it asks me to unmount all drives right?
[13:49] <apos> yes
[13:49] <apos> let it handle that
[13:49] <webfox> compdoc, maybe I am facing a DNS isu here.
[13:50] <famax8> <apos> yes bootloader on the same HD as windows one i cant fail is written on teh hd and partition win 7 loader ^^
[13:50] <craigbass1976> cfhowlett, apos Last holiday season (2011) I gave unity and gnome3 (ubuntu and fedora16) a try, couldn't deal with it, and went to xfce.  I'd like to try again, but was wondering if there was a guide somewhere with lots of "Well, duh... this is how you do such and such" types of things in it.  I miss a panel at the bottom showing all of my open windows; a place to see all of my apps (like an applications menu)
[13:51] <apos> craigbass1976,  its very simple to do. open ubuntu software center and search for xfce and press install
[13:51] <cfhowlett> craigbass1976, the latest version is xfce4.  let me look for a guide ....
[13:51] <compdoc> webfox, can you open an ip address:   http://74.125.141.106/
[13:51] <webfox> compdoc, when I try to ping ww.google.com it return a unknown host
[13:51] <craigbass1976> cfhowlett, apos I'm already running xfce.  I want to use unity successfully
[13:52] <apos> can you ping google.com
[13:52] <famax8> <craigbass1976>: try first to resize the resolution of your screen see if the missing windows or bars appear it happened to me many times before and still now with USt
[13:52] <apos> when you turn on the computer, at the password screen you can select unity3d as the window manager
[13:53] <famax8> <apos> again in the installer i clikc on the ext4 disk and it say no root file defined

[14:44] <K4k> Hi, I'm running Ubuntu on my Dell XPS 13. I've added the sputnik ppa but when I tried to install the latest 3.5.0-22 kernel (currently on 3.5.0-16) and I rebooted my screen was claiming a max resolution of 1024x768. Can someone please help, I've had to roll back to the *-16 kernel.
[14:45] <famax8bis> apos:  shall i install before update?
[14:45] <apos> you must run the update command first so that it can find it for the install
[14:46] <lantizia> How can I check what variable/settings were turned on/off at the time my standard ubuntu kernel was compiled?
[14:46] <theadmin> K4k: And why are you installing kernels from PPAs? That's not supported.
[14:46] <famax8bis> apos:  ok this is done
[14:46] <zykotick9> lantizia: check /boot for a config-* file
[14:46] <BluesKaj> K4k, if you are back on the default kernel then what is the problem , resolution still not correct ?
[14:47] <K4k> BluesKaj: the problem is that it keeps telling me a kernel update is available but being kept back
[14:47] <BluesKaj> k4k , get rid of the sputnik ppa
[14:47] <K4k> When I apply that update, however, it breaks my screen resolution because the ppa kernel I'm using includes some things which improve support for the Dell XPS "sputnik" laptops
[14:47] <lantizia> did Ubuntu put OSS support BACK into it's Kernel?
[14:48] <lantizia> why the flip is CONFIG_SOUND_OSS_CORE and CONFIG_SOUND_OSS_CORE_PRECLAIM set to yes?
[14:48] <K4k> BluesKaj: I will try the upstream one again and see what happens, I have a feeling it will break things again, however.
=== nyuszika7h_ is now known as nyuszika7h
[14:48] <theadmin> lantizia: I dunno about the kernel, there *may* be OSS support in the kernel for compatibility reasons, pulseaudio has OSS compaibility packages
[14:48] <theadmin> lantizia: But the main sound system in Ubuntu is Pulseaudio in combination with ALSA
[14:48] <lantizia> theadmin, I should all that was removed long ago
[14:49] <BluesKaj> K4k, if the ppa is suppoesed to enhance your experience with the Dell , but doesn't , then you know what to do .
[14:50] <theadmin> K4k, I have a Dell XPS 15Z, everything works out of the box, why do you need that PPA?
[14:50] <apos> famax8,  type boot-repair
[14:50] <lantizia> Can I somehow override the settings in that file when Linux boots WITHOUT having to recompile linux itself?
[14:51] <craigbass1976> Is there an "Official" app that will give me an apps menu?  I see that I have Main Menu installed where I can edit a menu, but I don't see where I can use the menu.
[14:51] <famax8bis> apos:  ok i found how ot insstall it now just im realizing im booted on usb again i think
[14:51] <theadmin> craigbass1976: There's no app for that, the menu is used in GNOME's Fallback mode, or other desktop environments such as Xfce, LXDE, KDE
[14:52] <craigbass1976> theadmin, no way to pin a menu to the side bar thing?
[14:52] <theadmin> craigbass1976: The Unity dash's "Applications" tab is the menu, no?
[14:52] <apos> run boot-repair, let it do its thing, shut down the computer and remove the live disk
[14:53] <famax8bis> apos:  running it as we speak
[14:53] <theadmin> Well, in an alternative form, for sure, but it's still got the hierarchy preserved and stuff

[14:53] <theadmin> craigbass1976: ...wait, wut?
[14:54] <lantizia> Anyone running an older ubuntu (say 11.04 or 11.10) who can post their /boot's config-3.0.x-xx-generic file  (only if you're running the default kernel)
[14:54] <famax8bis> i restart now
[14:54] <bentinata> Why sudo and running as root has different effect?
[14:54] <K4k> Ok, for some reason, after disabling the ppa, running and update, re-enabling the ppa and updating again it's no longer complaining of updates being held back so it looks like I'm good to go.
[14:55] <theadmin> bentinata: sudo is generally more secure, because you don't have to give people the root password, instead you can configure priveleges on a per-user/per-group basis
[14:55] <famax8> apos:  WWOOOOOHHHHOOOOOOO!!!!!!! it worked!
[14:55] <apos> famax8,  its telling you it should all be fixed now but you might need to change your bios boot sequence
[14:55] <apos> yeah!
[14:56] <MonkeyDust> famax8  problem solved?

[15:00] <ikonia> where did you get 3.7 ?
[15:00] <bentinata> theadmin: oh, thats why sudo can get "permission denied"
[15:01] <ikonia> that's not an official kernel

[15:04] <Unknown0BC> Anyone know how I could do that ?
[15:04] <ikonia> famax8: right, then the channel is #ubuntustudio - that is the correct channel, nowhere else
[15:05] <famax8> apos: yes but i need now kinda walkthrough for the softwares themselves as in how to create a sound and so on -
[15:05] <apos> #ubuntustudio will tell you themselves, if they arent around, seek help in #xubuntu

[15:05] <ikonia> #xubuntu is not for ubuntu studio
[15:05] <ikonia> u
[15:05] <ikonia> #ubuntustudio is the ONLY correct channel for ubuntustudio
[15:05] <famax8> ikonia:  ok ok gotcha chill out ^^
[15:05] <theadmin> ikonia: I think Ubuntu Studio is an officially supported deriv, so one can ask in #ubuntu too, am I wrong?
[15:06] <apos> u may
[15:06] <ikonia> theadmin: it's an official derivative, you can ask for help, but the correct channel for the specifics of ubuntustudio and using ubuntustudio is #ubuntustudio

[15:08] <kris_therrien> this is the 28 time i have reinstalled ubuntu server on my server as i keep getting freezez the error is kernel hung_task_timeout_secs
[15:08] <ikonia> kris_therrien: there will be a lot more error than that
[15:08] <ikonia> kris_therrien: however if you've installed it 28 times, it suggests a hardware error, or incompatability
=== ke5pcv is now known as ke5pcv-away
[15:08] <kris_therrien> yes it list every service i have running with the kernel hung task timeout secs 120
[15:09] <k1l> kris_therrien: is it a vserver?
[15:09] <kris_therrien> my server is hp proliant 380 g4
[15:09] <kris_therrien> not vertiual
[15:10] <theadmin> Well, HP is partnered with Canonical and Proliant servers come with Ubuntu preinstalled I think so we can cut out the probability of incompatibility...
[15:10] <kris_therrien> I have ruled out hardware as i have run every diagnostic i can think of and it comes back fine
[15:11] <ikonia> kris_therrien: that doesn't mean there is an incompatability
[15:11] <ikonia> kris_therrien: have you ran a memory test for example ?
[15:11] <kris_therrien> I read on one bug report of upgrading the smartaray firmware   yes i have run memory test and it passed
[15:12] <ikonia> kris_therrien: are you using the smart array in raid mode ?
[15:12] <ikonia> kris_therrien: what model array controller is it a p series ?
[15:12] <ikonia> or an i series
[15:12] <kris_therrien> hmm not sure on the series and its raid 0
[15:13] <ikonia> kris_therrien: ok, so a.) check the series of the card b.) install with out raid to test
[15:13] <k1l> kris_therrien: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1735680
[15:13] <ikonia> raid 0 is a bad technology to use for your root disks, so moving that out of the way for a test is a wise move
[15:14] <k1l> "The trick was upgrading the SmartArray firmware from version 2.36 to version 2.84. "
[15:14] <kris_therrien> it seems to make me use raid as i cannot seem to disable the smartarray
[15:14] <ikonia> kris_therrien: it will not make you use raid
[15:15] <ikonia> kris_therrien: if you set the array to have no volumes/arrays on it drops to jbod mode
[15:15] <ikonia> kris_therrien: I suggest researching your hardware a little more
[15:15] <ikonia> and being able to validate it's compatability beyond "I don't know"
[15:15] <ikonia> rather than just keep installing 28 times
[15:15] <kris_therrien> if i delete the logical drive from the array setup when i try to install ubuntu it shows no drives
[15:16] <ikonia> kris_therrien: I would suggest contacting HP to confirm the model number of the card (you should be able to see it from the smart array tools) and verifying how to drop it into jbod
[15:16] <ikonia> kris_therrien: if you MUST use raid, do a test with a raid 1 mirror
[15:17] <kris_therrien> ok ill go down to the server and find the model number

[15:19] <gchristensen> Hi, running 12.04 server for a mysql database. Is it safe to create the mysql user manually and then install the package?
[15:19] <ikonia> gchristensen: why do that ?
[15:19] <ikonia> gchristensen: what benifit is creating the user first ?
[15:19] <gchristensen> ikonia: I need to create the user and group with specific IDs
[15:20] <gchristensen> and if I install a package before mysql, then its liable to change the ID it receives
[15:20] <ikonia> gchristensen: that would be bad, as the installer assume certain things
[15:20] <ikonia> gchristensen: I would suggest changing it post install
[15:20] <gchristensen> okay
[15:22] <lantizia> Is there like a development or even kernel ubuntu channel?
[15:22] <kris_therrien> ok it is a hp smart aray i6 v2.34

[15:22] <theadmin> lantizia: There's #ubuntu-devel

[15:22] <lantizia> that's what I'm trying to remember :D
[15:22] <ikonia> gchristensen: I'd suggest just doing a chown aferwards to make sure

[15:43] <MySelf_> hello guys, could anyone help me with a stupid ubuntu problem?
[15:43] <FergusL> don't ask to ask MySelf_, just ask and wait
[15:43] <MySelf_> ok

[15:44] <FergusL> but the "hello" part is nice
[15:44] <petergk> L&G
[15:44] <MySelf_> after i installed new drivers for ati, i cant get into the "desktop"

[15:45] <adamk> MySelf_: How did you install these "new" drivers?
[15:45] <MySelf_> a guide on the internet lol
[15:45] <MonkeyDust> MySelf_  don't hit enter too often, please
[15:45] <petergk> :>
[15:45] <FergusL> MySelf_, petergk: maybe also looking at xorg.log ? where is it again ?
[15:45] <adamk> MySelf_: Ubuntu very nicely packages the proprietary drivers specifically for people who don't really know what they are doing.
[15:46] <adamk> MySelf_: Use a service like http://pastebin.com/ to show us your /var/log/Xorg.0.log file.

[15:48] <tonsofpcs> no, it's the thing that makes everything GUI
[15:48] <theadmin> MySelf_: eh. Are you on a fullscreen console/command line thing, or in some form of a graphical interface?
[15:48] <addi> ikonia, I tried that, then restarted lightdm (was following a tutorial) and it just gets stuck on a black screen after that
[15:49] <petergk> MySelf_, the X provides graphical user interface, the background for graphical applications and resources, via drivers access to the graphics cards
[15:49] <MySelf_> i were in terminal (fullscreen) and typed startX, and now i have a background picture (my own) i just pressed ctrl alt T
[15:50] <MySelf_> i just want the prop driver (download) and install
[15:50] <ikonia> addi: right, so your problem is not installing the drivers
[15:50] <petergk> ati had opengl issues in the past....
[15:50] <pochefuok_> hello everyone i get this error code extracting a zip file downloaded from web... can you help me please?
[15:50] <pochefuok_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1570093/

[15:51] <adamk> cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us
[15:51] <ikonia> addi: what have you done to verify it
[15:51] <Ghost1227> ikonia: thoughts?
[15:51] <jil> FergusL, I'm getting ther. I have to specif the device number.
[15:51] <FergusL> ha jil !
[15:51] <addi> ikonia, lsmod|grep nvidia

[15:52] <ikonia> addi: ok, so you know the module is loaded
[15:52] <ikonia> addi: is your xorg.conf set to use nvidia ?
[15:53] <Ghost1227> ikonia: Not in the installer at the moment, but yes. I can also still hit the cancel button and exit the installer. Just when I'm in the installer it sits there thinking forever.
[15:53] <petergk> MySelf_, if actually terminal runs it means some stuff are already in place
[15:53] <addi> um, no idea, I'm new to this :/
[15:53] <MySelf_> http://sprunge.us/VQNE
[15:53] <FergusL> jil: if the issue is still there you can also check "lsusb" if it's detected correctly or even "dmesg | tail" right after plugging it in, which might tell you how it went
[15:53] <Ghost1227> ikonia: tried both through 'try ubuntu' and 'install ubuntu' with the same issue at the same spot

[15:55] <mikehaas763_> Does Ubuntu run pretty stable on macs? natively that is not in a VM
[15:55] <ikonia> mikehaas763_: yes

[15:55] <adamk> ikonia: From the log file, it looks like the only PCI VGA devices are intel...
[15:56] <theadmin> mikehaas763_: Well, recent macs are fine, Ubuntu's dropped PowerPC support though I think
[15:56] <jhutchins> mikehaas763_: Been that way since ~2007.
[15:56] <mikehaas763_> theadmin, I'm not concerned with power pc. I'm on the market for a new laptop so I'd be getting something newer

[15:58] <mikehaas763_> jhutchins, I would like to because I want native performance
[15:58] <MonkeyDust> Squarism  if you don't like unity, you can easily install and use something else
[15:59] <theadmin> Squarism: The only shortcuts Unity uses have to do this or that with the Super key and that's not used by many apps...
[16:00] <jordanrain> I'm having problems with folders not being shared on reboot on 12.10. I was told it's because they aren't my main OS HDD's so they aren't mounted fast enough on boot to re-enable sharing? What can I do to get these auto shared again on boot? I'm using the built in sharing when you right click on a folder.

[16:01] <mikehaas763_> jhutchins, do you see a problem with that?
[16:01] <zombiejim> is ubuntu 12.04.1 supposed to be running the 3.5 kernel ?
[16:01] <craigbass1976> Is is possible to add a launcher to the dash that fires up a bash script?  With an icon?
[16:02] <theadmin> zombiejim: yup
[16:02] <zombiejim> theadmin, any idea why i reinstalled and did all updates and it isn't updating it to that kernel?
[16:03] <zombiejim> theadmin, and i keep getting crashes this install compiz etf
[16:03] <theadmin> zombiejim: Oh, err, wait, it's on 3.2
[16:03] <k1l> theadmin: you are sure?
[16:03] <theadmin> zombiejim: my bad
[16:03] <k1l> i only see 3.2 on packages.ubuntu.com
[16:03] <theadmin> k1l: Yeah my mistake
[16:03] <simpledot> zombiejim, iam using 3.2.0-36 right now
[16:04] <zombiejim> is there a way to fix compiz crashing? when it does my computer pretty much locks up for a few minutes
[16:04] <rdsm> I just installed the package "amd64-microcode" but it only updated the initrd.img for the last kernel installed , how do I make it update previous versions of the kernel?
[16:04] <shade34321> I have a NFS mount mounting on two machines. On one machine it is mounting right and on the other it is mounting with nobody/nogroup as the owner any suggestions why and how to fix it?
[16:05] <zombiejim> i only asked about kernel 3.5 because last time i installed ubuntu 12.04.1 and did the updates it went to kernel 3.5 for some reason
[16:05] <theadmin> rdsm: run "sudo update-initramfs -k VERSION", replacing VERSION with the kernel version you want the initrd to be generated for.
[16:05] <theadmin> zombiejim: Might be in backports or proposed
[16:05] <zombiejim> theadmin, it was a fresh install *shrug*
[16:05] <theadmin> zombiejim: oh, odd
[16:06] <zombiejim> theadmin, but this compiz crashing is killing me and my ability to use ubuntu
[16:06] <theadmin> zombiejim: Why not use a desktop that doesn't rely on crazy window managers like compiz, for instance, Xfce?
[16:06] <k1l> zombiejim: that 3.5 kernel came from a PPA, i think
[16:06] <zombiejim> im using what ubuntu came with?
[16:07] <jhutchins> mikehaas763_: Dual boot is a bit trickier than single system install, but it can be done.
[16:07] <rdsm> theadmin, it's asking: "You must specify at least one of -c, -u, or -d." should I tell it to -u right?
[16:07] <zombiejim> and xfce looks awful i shouldnt have to run something that looks 15 years old on an i5 processor
=== Ghost1227 is now known as Guest18444
[16:07] <jhutchins> mikehaas763_: I was just thinking that paying extra for Mac hardware if you're not going to be useing OSX isn't the best choice.
[16:07] <theadmin> rdsm: Oh, yes, right
[16:07] <theadmin> zombiejim: ...I have an i5 processor and run Xfce :P
[16:07] <theadmin> zombiejim: No complaints from me
[16:08] <zombiejim> theadmin, so basically unity is still horrible
[16:08] <zombiejim> theadmin, and thats why compiz keeps crashing
[16:08] <theadmin> zombiejim: Well, most people seem to think so
[16:08] <CoreyBR> hello, do you guys suggest me an application to facebook chat?
[16:08] <k1l> zombiejim: unity is fine here
[16:08] <adamk> zombiejim: Install ccsm and enable the crash handler plugin.
[16:08] <theadmin> CoreyBR: Ubuntu comes with Empathy, why not use that?
[16:08] <zombiejim> i have no problem with unity only the compiz crashing
[16:08] <k1l> so i dont like it to be called crazy like theadmin did
=== anna is now known as Guest21876
[16:08] <Xorifelse> How do you know which device/partition holds the mbr on a multi-boot run of Ubuntu/Windows?
[16:08] <jhutchins> zombiejim: compiz is still horrible, that's why unity keeps crashing, and KDE, and whatever else you run on compiz.
[16:08] <rdsm> theadmin, thanks a lot, it's updating, I thought that I needed to do something else before just updating :) , This package should make my C-50 runs better right?
[16:09] <zombiejim> does cinnamon use compiz?
[16:09] <theadmin> rdsm: Dunno what a C-50 is...
[16:09] <k1l> zombiejim: no, but its not supported in here
=== Guest18444 is now known as Ghost1227_
[16:09] <theadmin> zombiejim: Nope, I think GNOME3 (and therefore Cinnamon) has completely switched to Mutter.
[16:09] <rdsm> theadmin, amd vision cpu, I don't know if it was improved by this microcode or by 3.8 changes , I'll test here anyway , thanks :)
[16:09] <zombiejim> k1l, thats not a good idea, if what ubuntu comes with is unity and crashes why not support what works at lesat
[16:09] <Ghost1227_> ikonia: I'm in the live environment now
[16:10] <zombiejim> k1l, least
[16:10] <k1l> zombiejim: ubuntu got alot of desktops supported
[16:10] <jhutchins> zombiejim: We can only consistently support projects that are part of ubuntu.
[16:10] <k1l> zombiejim: and again: unity and compiz work here. so its not a generall problem
[16:10] <theadmin> zombiejim: Ubuntu officially supports 4 desktops: Unity, KDE, Xfce and LXDE. That's plenty.
[16:11] <zombiejim> the two that are supported that have decent looks are crashing

[16:11] <Ephexeve> Hey guys, I am having a few problems wiht my wireless card, it's stable for 10 min max and then it starts to disconnect..
[16:11] <zombiejim> because they are based off compiz which from what i've read the guy who's been making it quit
[16:11] <mhs> Recently our college has introduced ubuntu as college syllabus.
[16:12] <k1l> zombiejim: so what is your actual issue besides ranting?
[16:12] <zombiejim> k1l, every 5 minutes compiz crashes
[16:12] <ubuser> Guys! I came out of the store with a brand new Dell Latitude e5530 preloaded with Ubuntu 11.10!!! Ubuntu rulezzzzz!!!
[16:12] <adamk> zombiejim: Again, enable the crash handler plugin and see what errors compiz gives when it crashes.
[16:12] <jhutchins> ubuser: So quit using it.
[16:12] <k1l> zombiejim: provide the logs and error messages so see what causes it
[16:12] <jhutchins> ubuser: Sorry, wrong nick.

[16:13] <mhs> Can anybody tell me that how to install software without internet connection
[16:14] <ubuser> Ubuntu + Dell = LOVE
[16:14] <zombiejim> k1l, but i will say i'd use linux mint because the users are much more friendly to linux noobs.. but nvidia will not work with them properly which is why im forced to use ubuntu
[16:14] <theadmin> mhs: You normally don't. What a weird thing to do.
[16:14] <ubuser> now I update it to LTS
[16:14] <theadmin> zombiejim: Have you tried Xubuntu? Kubuntu? Lubuntu?
[16:14] <Ephexeve> Anyone?
[16:14] <theadmin> zombiejim: They are all officially supported Ubuntu versions with different desktops preloaded.
[16:14] <k1l> zombiejim: so just another pun. im out.
[16:14] <makara> hi. From yesterday my 12.04 notebook won't boot - stuck on purple and black garbage screen. No ctrl+alt+f1 or +del. Safemode boots. What's up?
[16:14] <mhs> What?
[16:14] <rdsm> theadmin, system is much faster now :) amd64-microcode package with 3.4+ kernels really makes the c-50 usable :)
[16:14] <mhs> I'm not getting.
[16:15] <CoreyBR> theadmin: sorry for the late response, i was afk, i'm new in linux i'll try empathy thanks
[16:15] <zombiejim> theadmin, I want a DE that I can drag windows to the side and have them automatically resize themselves properly like unity does, be able to just press the window key and search for a program ctrl+alt+t terminal etc
[16:15] <makara> mhs: you get the .deb file and open that, but usually not
[16:15] <zykotick9> makara: tried nomodeset yet?  see "/msg ubottu nomodeset" for details.
[16:16] <zombiejim> k1l, later.. what else would you expect being attacked by 4 people at once because im ignorant to linux and trying to learn

[16:22] <jordanrain> How can I get samba shares to startup on boot?
[16:22] <MySelf_> sudo X gives me "server is already active for display 0"
[16:22] <LIDH> hello, I need help, i get "no PS/2 driver found under /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX" and can't get the touch to work
[16:22] <zykotick9> jhutchins: ahhh ubuntu != debian.  there isn't the entire repo on dvd for ubuntu.
[16:22] <jhutchins> mhs: Most linux distributions use a software management system rather than a download-and-install concept.
[16:22] <simpledot> zombiejim, you're the guy that has 3.5 kernel?
[16:22] <cleamoon> is there any good accounting program in linux?
[16:22] <k1l> MySelf_: what are you trying to do?
[16:22] <commode-rocket> mhs basically you will need internet connection intially for download and building your own repo server
[16:23] <zombiejim> simpledot, no the first install when i did the updates it went to 3.5 kernel, this time it stayed on 3.2 after updates
[16:23] <jhutchins> zykotick9: Yeah, I'm thinkin' debian.
[16:23] <zombiejim> simpledot, err should say yes thats me
[16:23] <LIDH> how do i Add the PS/2 mouse driver?
[16:23] <makara> mhs: .deb files. It depends on what the developer of the software offers you. Sometimes its something else.
[16:23] <jhutchins> mhs: This suggests a local mirror would be a better idea.
[16:23] <MySelf_> k1l: i try to get into GUI
[16:24] <k1l> zombiejim: there is no 3.5 kernel in precise. and if you dont give and logs or errormessages noone can help you by inly guessing
[16:24] <k1l> MySelf_: start the dm like "sudo service lightdm start"
[16:24] <mhs> Please don't mind, as I have told that I am totally new to this ubuntu. I not understanding what this mirror a d repo server is all about. Please guide me that where I can get ubuntu beginner help.
[16:24] <jhutchins> zombiejim: You might consider pastbining your sources.list so we can figure out where you got a 3.5 kernel from.
[16:24] <MySelf_> unrecognized service
[16:24] <jhutchins> zombiejim: Or you could just tell us.
[16:25] <k1l> MySelf_: which ubuntu are you running there?
[16:25] <MySelf_> 12.10
[16:25] <zombiejim> jhutchins, i reinstalled ubuntu this time im not running 3.5
[16:25] <jhutchins> MySelf_: What do you see if you press Alt-F7?
[16:25] <k1l> MySelf_: try "sudo start lightdm"
[16:25] <zombiejim> jhutchins, i just thought something was wrong because last time it went to 3.5 this time it didnt,  i had no idea which was correct
[16:26] <MySelf_> nothing...
[16:26] <MySelf_> uknown job

[16:26] <theadmin> MySelf_: sudo /etc/init.d/*dm start
[16:27] <Ben64> k1l, jhutchins: I think a 3.5 kernel is in precise, just not by default
[16:27] <MySelf_> it was not isntalled, i installed now and run the start thing

[16:33] <jhutchins> mhs: Yes, by the same process, but you don't need it for each system, you just need one common source.
[16:34] <commode-rocket> yes you will create a large pool of packages on a single server which can have over 100 or 10000 packages.....an be able to install these packages from any other ubuntu system.....provided the packages are for that version of ubuntu

[16:45] <mozzl3> can
[16:45] <LIDH> jhutchins thanks, but i still don't get it, it is not a mouse, it's a touch controller that isn't detected
[16:45] <fellayaboy> i know the webcam works jsut fine cuz ubuntu asked me to take a pic when i first installed the ubuntu
[16:45] <LIDH> it is PS/2 interface
[16:46] <jhutchins> fellayaboy: The plugins for those services have to know about your camera and be able to access it through a common interface like tv://
[16:47] <fellayaboy> ok how do i do that then
[16:47] <jhutchins> LIDH: You'll have to search on the actual hardware model then, there were/are various different devices that connected through PS/2 ports (which are basically just serial ports).  You could blindly try the existing PS/2 compatible drivers, but it's better to track down the specific hardware.
[16:47] <mrintegrity> hi all, does anyone know of a USB3.0 graphics adaptor that has any support under ubuntu?
[16:47] <smt> hi, is there a way to modify a desktop setup to use server repositories?
[16:47] <commode-rocket> mhs ++1 jhutchins
[16:48] <jhutchins> ;)
[16:48] <mrintegrity> smt: it's the same repo..
[16:48] <commode-rocket> hi vibhav
[16:49] <smt> hmm, so i would get security updates with a desktop sytem as long as server support is going on?
[16:49] <awaterma> Hey all! I'm having trouble bringing up two network cards on the same box under 12.10. When one goes up, the other drops.
[16:49] <mrintegrity> smt: not sure what you mean really.. the update / support cycle is based on the ubuntu version number.. doesn't matter if you are running it as a server o desktop.. or what cd image you installed from
[16:50] <LIDH> it's egalax touch, already have the drivers, but when i install it shows up a "error" (no ps/2 mouse driver found under /dev/bus/serio/devices/serioX
[16:50] <awaterma> Do all network cards have to be configured with the same gateway?
[16:50] <mrintegrity> awaterma: no, you can have multiple gateways..
[16:50] <zykotick9> awaterma: what are you hoping to achieve?
[16:50] <rdsm> awaterma, no you can have multiple , check out the route command.
[16:50] <awaterma> I have a server with 4 nics, love to make use of all 4 for bridging to kvm
[16:51] <MonkeyDust> awaterma  #ubuntu-server
[16:51] <awaterma> Ah,
[16:51] <smt> mrintegrity: lts support for 10.04 server is supported until 2015 whereas desktop support ends in april this year
[16:51] <awaterma> thanks MonkeyDust
[16:51] <mrintegrity> awaterma: you can bond them into one large connection (minus some overhead).. but they would use the same gateway in that case
[16:51] <mrintegrity> smt: oh right! sorry yeah i guess you are correct then
[16:51] <awaterma> Thanks mrintegrity.
[16:52] <mrintegrity> awaterma: look up ubuntu bonding
[16:52] <awaterma> What I want is two bridges, each one covering 2 nics.

[16:52] <awaterma> ubuntu bonding. Okay, will do, and I'll bug the guys over in #ubuntu-server. I'm glad to see that I'm not looking for a crazy solution.
[16:52] <mrintegrity> awaterma: yep, two bonds (they are called nic teams in the windows world)
[16:52] <smt> mrintegrity: u think a desktop system would get the security updates as long as server is supported?
[16:53] <awaterma> Huge thanks mrintegrity! :)
[16:53] <jhutchins> LIDH: Was the touchpad connected when you installed?
[16:53] <awaterma> Exactly, what I'm looking for. Too bad there's not a nice Enterprise right up on Ubuntu KVM and multiple nic networking.

[16:57] <_t4nn3r> craigbass1976: But doesnt a keyboard shortcut just for the trash make so much more sense?
[16:57] <k1l> craigbass1976: standard is ctrl+alt+t
[16:58] <LIDH> it only appears to detect the keyboard PS/2 port, the "mouse" isn't detected
[16:58] <LIDH> PS/2 mouse port isn't detected
[16:58] <craigbass1976> _t4nn3r, are you messing with me?
[16:58] <LIDH> already reinstalled to windows to check if it was working, and yes, it is and is located on the PS/2 port
[16:58] <LIDH> so basically it is a PS/2 touch input
[16:58] <LIDH> problem is, getting ubuntu to recognize it
[16:58] <_t4nn3r> craigbass1976: lol yeah. Why would you ever need to open the trash?
[16:58] <jhutchins> LIDH: You don't need the driver for the port, you need the driver for the touchscreen.
[16:59] <LIDH> i already downloaded the drivers from the egalax website and still nothing
[16:59] <craigbass1976> _t4nn3r, ok...  Threw me for a bit.
[16:59] <Sorinan> There's a way to create a nested RAID1+0 in the Ubuntu installer?
[16:59] <LIDH> if i do cat /sys/bus/serio/devices/serioX/description

[17:14] <LIDH> nope, 32bit
[17:15] <jhutchins> LIDH: Since the correct way to install the drivers is with apt, and since your system doesn't correctly find the drivers, I suspect you DON'T already have the drivers, but if you prefer to go your own way rather than follow the guides I posted that's fine.
[17:16] <jamaadaar> LIDH is your driver ending with .deb
[17:16] <jhutchins> LIDH: You need to configure the xorg.conf file for it to work in a GUI.
[17:16] <LIDH> i already did lots of tutorials
[17:16] <LIDH> but let me check once again
[17:16] <jhutchins> LIDH: That could be the problem, you might need a clean install to un-do the stuff about external drivers.
[17:16] <LIDH> the drivers i have to install are using sh
[17:16] <LIDH> this is clean
[17:16] <LIDH> already reinstalled
[17:17] <LIDH> i did try a lot of tutorials yesterday

[17:32] <larsduesing> Hi together... Can anybody help me? I need to make a backup keeping owner and rights - problem is: target is a ntfs-partition (tar would be ok, but it keeps only permissions)

[17:32] <ApeShot> but which side of the slider is for windows and which is for linux?
[17:32] <ApeShot> They are unlabeled
[17:32] <jrib> larsduesing: you're sure tar doesn't preserve ownership?  I thought it did

[17:35] <jhutchins> larsduesing: Check the manpage for tar - it can preserve ownership.

[17:52] <scristopher> I need to remove this damn clock lock thing, and i dont know what its called.
[17:52] <scristopher> does anyone know what im talking about?
[17:52] <jhutchins> scristopher: Try changing the screensaver setting.
[17:52] <scristopher> in installed xscreensaver the lock isnt active, removed gnome screensaver
[17:53] <compdoc> Chriys, this is your domain?  domain ahidjodesign.com
[17:53] <OerHeks> erupter, see http://askubuntu.com/questions/131497/disable-automatic-unity-launching
[17:53] <Chriys> yes
[17:53] <scristopher> disabled the lock in brightness and lock
[17:53] <scristopher> I noticed this clock screensaver thing before i installed xscreensaver
[17:53] <erupter> OerHeks, that does not allow me to start unity
[17:53] <compdoc> Chriys, when you hook up the router, what ip address does ubuntu obtain?
[17:53] <erupter> OerHeks, is I boot in text and then run "unity" it can't find no monitor
[17:53] <erupter> *if
[17:54] <jhutchins> scristopher: Are you running a DNS server?
[17:54] <scristopher> no
[17:54] <Chriys> 192.168.1.101 i configured the router to give this ip to the computer
[17:54] <jhutchins> Does your router run a DNS server?
[17:54] <OerHeks> erupter, in that same ans
[17:54] <larsduesing> jrib: Hmm, strange. this works with me
[17:54] <scristopher> umm it does not
[17:54] <OerHeks> erupter, in that same answer "Also, you can still launch it any time you want manually by doing sudo service lightdm start"
[17:54] <larsduesing> <- problem maybe in front of computer
[17:54] <jhutchins> scristopher: THen you need to put a valid nameserver in the resolv.conf.
[17:55] <OerHeks> startx might also work
[17:55] <erupter> OerHeks, so I shouldn't run "unity" but rather start lightdm first and then run unity?
[17:55] <scristopher> for the clock lock screen to disable?
[17:55] <jhutchins> scristopher: 8.8.8.8 is valid, but you should probably use the one provided by your isp.
[17:55] <jhutchins> scristopher: Your isp probably sets the nameserver via dhcp when you connect directly.

[18:00] <manni> i need help with sound problem in ubuntu 12.04
[18:00] <jhutchins> Chriys: When you connect directly, your ISP's DHCP server provides a valid nameserver (usually two).  You need to see what that is and configure that either with the router's DHCP server or directly in your resolv.conf.

[18:02] <manni> tried both

[18:24] <damselfly9> ChkDigit; if you disable it for the cd install, you can then blacklist the module and re-enable it in the bios afterwards

[18:30] <bekks> !anyone | kovu
[18:30] <ubottu> kovu: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[18:30] <jrtappers> How do I get ubuntu to use all my monitors? It only uses the third for Ctrl-Alt-F1
[18:30] <bekks> LIDH: Please be more precise about which system you actually have, currently.
[18:30] <oskiiiiii> hi all
[18:30] <kovu> i have a printer i cant install its a bj-10sx
[18:30] <oskiiiiii> I have problems with a 4k sector sized HD from toshiba and Quantal Quetzal
[18:31] <bekks> oskiiiiii: Which problems in detail?
[18:31] <oskiiiiii> Normal installation failed and now I cannot work propperly with partitions
[18:31] <oskiiiiii> at this moment I am zeroing hd
[18:31] <oskiiiiii> with dd
[18:31] <bekks> oskiiiiii: Failed? Why, which error message did you get?
[18:31] <bekks> oskiiiiii: And zeroing is pointless, basically.
[18:32] <kovu> if anyone can help me please pm me
[18:32] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: Maybe you should check the HD's health?
[18:32] <pinkfloyd1994> cristian ci sei?
[18:32] <manni> i set to 153% but didn't work
[18:32] <jrtappers> Anyone know of a solution to this kind of problem http://superuser.com/questions/510302/multiple-monitors-with-multiple-gpus-on-linux-nvidia-intel
[18:32] <samba35> i want to use internet connecting mobile phone using usb cable ,so how do i configur it ,which package is should use
[18:33] <oskiiiiii> does normal installation of ubuntu care about 4k disks?
[18:33] <damselfly9> kovu; the bj-10sx is reported to work under ubuntu. what installation problem are you having
[18:33] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: And you should describe in a bit more detail what went wrong.
[18:33] <oskiiiiii> sorry
[18:33] <oskiiiiii> ok
[18:33] <bekks> oskiiiiii: No known installation cares about 4k sectors, because there is nothing to care about.
[18:33] <kovu> it cant detect it and i cant frind it under add printer nor find drivers for ir or know how to install them
[18:34] <oskiiiiii> my old hd failed, so I replaced it
[18:34] <oskiiiiii> I had problems with the new one
[18:34] <oskiiiiii> so I thought It was a controller problem
[18:34] <bekks> oskiiiiii: WHICH problems...?
[18:34] <manni> the sound scale in the level bar just fluctuate at around 1 percent
[18:34] <bekks> oskiiiiii: Please describe your problem, not the entire environment :)
[18:35] <ironhalik> Is there a way to make empathy 3.6 sort contacts by their status?
[18:35] <manni> but the output is working fine
[18:35] <oskiiiiii> installation went slow and at the end it reboots, as I remmember
[18:35] <bekks> oskiiiiii: So it didnt fail.
[18:35] <oskiiiiii> ok
[18:35] <oskiiiiii> please let me explain
[18:35] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: Don't use Enter for punctuation.
[18:35] <bekks> oskiiiiii: And now please describe the problem you are having. :)
[18:36] <manni> should there be another problem
[18:36] <manni> with the libraries?
[18:36] <kovu> i cant make it work under 12.10
[18:37] <oskiiiiii> Ok, at this moment I have problems creating and erasing partitions, and if I run the installation it says i/o disk error
[18:37] <manni> any command to install sound libraries?
[18:37] <jhutchins> kovu: Do you have cups installed & running?
[18:37] <bekks> oskiiiiii: Then show us the error(s) please, in a pastebin.
[18:37] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: Sounds like a bad HD.
[18:37] <bekks> !paste | oskiiiiii
[18:37] <ubottu> oskiiiiii: For posting multi-line texts into the channel, please use http://paste.ubuntu.com | To post !screenshots use http://imagebin.org/?page=add | !pastebinit to paste directly from command line | Make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic.
[18:37] <kovu> whats cups
[18:37] <manni> can it be a problem with audio dispatcher?
[18:37] <oskiiiiii> It is a new HD
[18:38] <kovu> i guess not let me install it now from the software menu
[18:38] <jhutchins> kovu: Common Unix Printing System - the stuff that works with the printers.
[18:38] <bekks> oskiiiiii: Which doesnt mean it can be broken.
[18:38] <oskiiiiii> yes
[18:38] <bekks> oskiiiiii: Please show us the errors in a pastebin.
[18:38] <BadileDaOrto> hi all
[18:38] <oskiiiiii> ok, I will come back later after re-running installation
[18:38] <BadileDaOrto> i have a problem on lubuntu with nxserver
[18:38] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: Just because it is new does not mean it can't be defective.
[18:39] <BadileDaOrto> anyone use it?
[18:39] <manni> sppech dispatcher i mean
[18:39] <bekks> oskiiiiii: How about just giving us the errors you already have?
[18:39] <manni> *speech
[18:39] <jhutchins> bekks: If you were paying attention instead of harassing him, you would have understood that he hasn't succeeded in installing, so he's not gonna be able to pastebin the errors.
[18:39] <kovu> yes i have common unix printing system installed
[18:39] <BadileDaOrto> this my log : http://pastebin.com/kmKR7zTH
[18:39] <damselfly9> kovu; the manual for your printer indicates it is a parallel port model, so no usb problems. does the printer's self-test show that is it working correctly?
[18:39] <bekks> jhutchins: If YOU were reading with poaying a bit more attentio to it, you would have read that he told us that the installation was finished without errors.
[18:39] <oskiiiiii> bekks: ok I will give you in a while in a while.
[18:40] <kovu> yes i printed off a test page and have a parrellel to usb cable
[18:40] <oskiiiiii> thanks a lot
[18:40] <manni> how can i install speech dispatcher again?
[18:40] <kovu> i know it works as i used it on windows xp to print before
[18:40] <manni> i think that is problematic
[18:41] <usr13_> bekks: On the contrary, he said " Normal installation failed"
[18:41] <garaje> ff
[18:41] <damselfly9> kovu; oh. so there might be a usb problem with the printer not being detected through the usb-parallel converter
[18:41] <manni> i have installed ubuntu multiple times in last week
[18:41] <bekks> usr13_: And later on, being a bit more precise, he said the installation was slow and it rebooted after finishing. Which is quite normal :)
[18:41] <manni> 32 bit then 64 bit
[18:42] <usr13_> bekks: But you are correct in complaining that he did not give any information as to the nature of the failure.
[18:42] <bekks> :)
[18:42] <manni> in both sound input is not working
[18:42] <kovu> damselfly9; so how do i test this
=== Guest59436 is now known as VlanX
[18:42] <nick_h> `dpkg -l | grep skype` says that the package "skype" is installed. but "sudo aptitude purge skype" outputs "No packages will be installed, upgraded, or removed". how can i remove skype?
[18:43] <VlanX> I amm currently downloading a video from youtube, how about i'd like to see where the file is currently saved? Can i use iotop?
[18:43] <usr13_> bekks: I think you got the point across and he'll be back with more specific information.
[18:43] <Devaki> can anyone help me installing steam ?
[18:43] <manni> i don't like win7 because there is no unity
[18:43] <Devaki> it says wrong architecture 'i386' , but there's no other option in steam website :S
[18:43] <scristopher> Devaki, i just installed steam on x64 with no issue
[18:43] <damselfly9> kovu; if you try typing "lsusb" in a console window, it should tell which usb devices are detected, hopefully your printer is shown
[18:43] <usr13_> !stea, | Devaki
[18:43] <scristopher> Devaki, http://store.steampowered.com/about/
[18:43] <usr13_> !steam | Devaki

[18:44] <kovu> ok let me try now
[18:44] <manni> but i need to give it a try
[18:44] <scristopher> im not sure what the problem is but i had no issue downloading the steam client from there and installing it
[18:44] <manni> if the sound work

[18:45] <Devaki> Then it is ubuntu's fault.
[18:45] <scristopher> im not sure how
[18:45] <manni> i think there is some bug
[18:45] <manni> is it?
[18:45] <scristopher> i just installed on 12.10x64
[18:45] <kovu> sorry
[18:45] <scristopher> no problem
[18:45] <scristopher> from that site
[18:45] <Devaki> hpow ?
[18:46] <scristopher> http://store.steampowered.com/about/
[18:46] <scristopher> from there
[18:46] <manni> i have 12.04
[18:46] <Devaki> I kno , i downloaded from there too
[18:46] <manni> also the same problem was in 12.10
[18:46] <scristopher> downloaded opened with software center and installed
[18:46] <oskiiiiii> Hi again. The error message: input/output error during write in /dev/sda
[18:46] <damselfly9> kovu; unless it was in the part the flood control bot suppressed, I see no mention of your printer being detected
[18:46] <Devaki> software center says wrong architecture i386
[18:46] <scristopher> did you try to install it using terminal
[18:47] <scristopher> Devaki, sudo dpkg --force-architecture -i yourfilename.deb
[18:47] <manni> Devaki: install i386 libraries then
[18:47] <kovu> oh so what do i do then
[18:47] <nmmm> sorry for the spam, but  how can I show progress bar for TuxOnIce (hibernation script), dont mind if is text mode or graphical?  may be i need fbsplash?
[18:47] <Devaki> manni how ?
[18:47] <scristopher> yeah you may be missing the i386 libs
[18:48] <Guest8945> hello. when is iso for 12.04.02 going to be out
[18:48] <Guest8945> what day
[18:48] <kovu> shall i take out the usb then use the command again and see if it still comes up
[18:48] <scristopher> i didnt.. but then again i installed gnome3 and am not using unity
[18:48] <Guest8945> scristopher: is gome 3 faster
[18:48] <damselfly9> kovu; was the printer powered on when you booted?
[18:48]  * kovu smacks himself i didnt turn it on when i used the command 
[18:49] <Ronalds_M> I like gtk theme in chrome
[18:49] <Devaki> sudo dpkg --force-architecture -i worked , but i dont know f this is a proper way to install stuff
[18:49] <Ronalds_M> can I get it for all apps
[18:49] <Ronalds_M> ?
[18:49] <kovu> nope it still has the same information
[18:49] <liquidmetal> A youtube question. Is there a way to create subscription lists? Like a list of 'entertainment' subscriptions, one list for 'educational' ones and another one for news?
[18:49] <manni> devaki: i did but forgot , u can try sudo apt-get install -f
[18:49] <scristopher> well you need the x86 libs
[18:49] <scristopher> apt-get install ia32-libs
[18:49] <oskiiiiii> The error message formating with Disks utility: Cannot mount /dev/sda at /var/run/udisks2/block-format-tos-EUFH1l: Invalid argument (udisks-error-quark, 0)
[18:49] <scristopher> i think
[18:50] <Devaki> scristopher  , so this will fix the problems ?
[18:50] <Ronalds_M> Liquedmaster, there is but this isn't chat for youtube
[18:50] <bekks> oskiiiiii: So you booted from that harddrive?
[18:50] <Ronalds_M> chrome gtk theme anyone?
[18:50] <oskiiiiii> I booted from live CD
[18:50] <kovu> that qinheng electronics was the device
[18:50] <Guest8945> is it necessary to intall 32bit compatit nvidia
[18:50] <xangua> Ronalds_M: chromium/chrome uses the current gtk theme, you make no sence :)
[18:50] <k1l> Guest8945: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseSchedule?action=show&redirect=PreciseReleaseSchedule
[18:50] <kovu> it detects it
[18:50] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: I would partition and format and run fsck and see if the HD is good or not.
[18:50] <damselfly9> kovu; if you try typing "dmesg" in a console window, near the end of it's output there might be a line mentioning "lpt1"
[18:50] <liquidmetal> Ronalds_M: where should I go?
[18:50] <Guest8945> thanks
[18:51] <Ronalds_M> what?
[18:51] <oskiiiiii> usr13_: I got this message formatting
[18:51] <manni> i am asking help for audio
[18:51] <scristopher> also Devaki http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/846939615004873516/
[18:51] <liquidmetal> Ronalds_M: "to ask a youtube question" :P
[18:51] <Ronalds_M> chrome has there own window borders xuanga
[18:51] <Ronalds_M> #youtube maybe
[18:51] <manni> last try today
[18:51] <liquidmetal> Ronalds_M: there's nothing there
[18:52] <David-A> oskiiiiii: how is the HD connected? internal/external? have you tried unplug/replug cable? if usb try shorter cable? DiskUtility (e.g. when running a live cd) can tell you health status of HD.
[18:52] <liquidmetal> Ronalds_M: what do you use?
[18:52] <bekks> oskiiiiii: Normally, you do not format an entire harddisk, but only a partition on it.
[18:52] <Guest8945> k1l: when is .02 release iso out? that page wont say
[18:52] <k1l> Guest8945: sure it does
[18:52] <oskiiiiii> David-A: internal via sata
[18:52] <Guest8945> i dont know
[18:53] <k1l> Guest8945: come on. just use your eyes and read that table listed on that page.
[18:53] <manni> anyone know how to solve the issue?
[18:53] <Guest8945> oh i see it
[18:53] <Guest8945> i went to wrong page
[18:53] <oskiiiiii> I created a partition ocuppying all the space and formatted
[18:53] <Guest8945> 2/14/13
[18:53] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: There are a couple of utilities you might be interested in:  smartct and hdparm,  "smartct -a /dev/hd?  |less" "hdparm -i /dev/hd?"  (smartct most importantly) See  http://www.hdsentinel.com/hdslin.php for info about hdsentinel.
[18:53] <oskiiiiii> just to try
[18:54] <David-A> oskiiiiii: try disconnect reconnect the sata cables?
[18:54] <oskiiiiii> David-A: It is a laptop
[18:54] <jaco> hi, anybody knows why hdmi sound and video go jumping
[18:54] <oskiiiiii> The disk has been connected to a broken HD controller, may it affect?
[18:54] <kovu> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1570557/plain/
[18:54] <Ronalds_M> is there some way to make window borders with icons like chrome have
[18:54] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: YOu could first run fsck  and see what it looks like.
[18:55] <manni> ok thanks for no help bye bye
[18:55] <kovu> i cant see any lpt1
[18:55] <Ronalds_M> I'm on xfce
[18:55] <Ronalds_M> but it's on ubuntu
[18:55] <David-A> oskiiiiii: the smartctl show s.m.a.r.t status of the hd. DiskUtility is a gui that can show the same info.
[18:55] <petergk> xfaceis cool
[18:55] <bhola> hi
[18:55] <Gilbert32> hello
[18:55] <petergk> xfce is one of the most coolest desktop
[18:56] <Ronalds_M> I agree

[18:56] <Ronalds_M> Unity has few glitches in 12.10  and it's not ready for serious work
[18:56] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: I usually just do  fsck -y /dev/sdx
[18:56] <wjtaylor_> anyone every get a verizon air card to work with 12.04?
[18:56] <kostkon> Ronalds_M, such as?
[18:56] <Gilbert32> does anybody have a set of an old and a new amd graphics card (like 4250 and 5650) on a laptop and ubuntu 12.10?
[18:57] <Ronalds_M> such as windows scale effect and show windows icons
[18:57] <Ronalds_M> and global menu visibility
[18:57] <Ronalds_M> and other
[18:57] <scristopher> well Ronalds_M gnome3 runs pretty smooth on 12.10 but i have not tried unity
[18:57] <Ronalds_M> gnome 3 is worse than cinnamon
[18:57] <Guest8945> why is lo-menubar not included in lts libreoffice. it is a standard bug fix
[18:57] <LIDH> how do i enter software graphics mode on ubunt 12.04
[18:57] <LIDH> ?
[18:57] <oskiiiiii> smart status shows bad sectors
[18:57] <scristopher> besides the 5 minutes i had it after the install during my gnome3 install
[18:57] <Guest8945> cinnamon is not good. use gnome-panel for gnome 2. is it good
[18:57] <Guest8945> apt-get install gnome-panel
[18:57] <scristopher> pft gnome3 rocks
[18:57] <k1l> Ronalds_M: there are several user who can seriuosly work with unity. so that is not a general statment :/
[18:57] <damselfly9> kovu; the thing lsusb detected was your usb-parallel convertor. It appears ubuntu isn't detecting your bj-10sx through that convertor. You will need to manually specify your printer as being a usb printer of the bj-10sx type
[18:58] <scristopher> extensions tweak the whole thing out make it extremely powerful and easy to use IMHO
[18:58] <Guest8945> how is gnome 3.6 on fedora? not the old one in ubuntu
[18:58] <ryankask> hi all. i am about to move my ubuntu partition to a new ssd. I don't see any options to "hibernate" so I'm not going to allocate much swap space. I do occasionally "suspend" -- will I be able to suspend without swap?
[18:58] <kovu> so how do i do that please i am a noob at this type of thing
[18:58] <LIDH> just did some settings to xorg.conf and now it wont display any image
[18:58] <usr13_> oskiiiiii: Might try and repair them. (But if there are too many in one spot, it may be a no-go).
[18:58] <compdoc> oskiiiiii, sounds bad
[18:58] <Ronalds_M> k1l, try doing spreadsheets
[18:58] <David-A> oskiiiiii: good its a new HD then, return it and get a fresh one
[18:58] <zykotick9> ryankask: ubuntu disabled hibernate by default...
[18:59] <Ronalds_M> try some games and webbrowsing, until it locks in some phase
[18:59] <damselfly9> kovu; me too, I have an ethernet print server so I never need to mess around with usb printers
[18:59] <ryankask> zykotick9: so I can safely do without more than 2gb swap with 8gb ram + ss
[18:59] <ryankask> d
[18:59] <ryankask> or possibly no swap
[18:59] <LIDH> just did some settings to xorg.conf and now it wont display any image, how do I solve it?
[18:59] <zykotick9> ryankask: sidenote - hibernate requires as much swap as you have physical ram + a little
[18:59] <kovu> darn so you sont know either
[18:59] <Ronalds_M> how is gnome panel better than xfce panel
[18:59] <Gilbert32> does swap affect suspend?
[19:00] <Ronalds_M> ?
[19:00] <oskiiiiii> The fact is that I had another disk with showed bad sectors in smart status, so I replaced by a new one. Still failing, so I though that it was a bad controller. I send to repair the laptop, and plug the old drive in an identical new laptop, bad sectors again. New drive+new laptop, same problems
[19:00] <kovu> fudge
[19:00] <k1l> Ronalds_M: where are the bug reports? etc. unity is fine here and on other systems. so your opinion stays your opinion and is not a general problem
[19:00] <zykotick9> ryankask: no swap = slower system, but do what you want.
[19:00] <Ronalds_M> in general it's just it's compiz functions are broken
[19:00] <Ronalds_M> and some openoffice stuff brokes sometimes
[19:00] <oskiiiiii> Maybe both HDs are bad, maybe both laptops, but both possibilities sounds weird
[19:00] <kovu> anyway you know someone or something that will help me out
[19:01] <Ronalds_M> but generally less than windows
[19:01]  * scristopher doesnt care for unity
[19:01] <ryankask> i'm going to create a 2gb swap partition
[19:01] <compdoc> oskiiiiii, bad luck then
[19:01] <ryankask> off to install this bad boy, thanks for the assistance
[19:01] <usr13_> ryankask: Do you have 2G RAM?
[19:01] <ryankask> i have 8gb
[19:01] <usr13_> ryankask: Make your swap 8G
[19:02] <zykotick9> ryankask: only follow usr13_'s advice if you want hibernate
[19:02] <damselfly9> kovu; it's not so easy, ubuntu printing expects a usb printer to id itself, but tht's not happening because it's really a paralle printer
[19:02] <usr13_> zykotick9: There are other reasons.
[19:02] <SolarisBoy> +1 other wise 2GB is fine
[19:02] <k1l> so Ronalds_M if you dont have an actual issue to be solved keep the general "unity is bad" talk to the offtopic channels please
[19:02] <ktheory> in ubuntu for some reason
[19:02] <zykotick9> usr13_: beyond 2.5GB swap becomes less effective...
[19:02] <ktheory> whenever i put my laptop to sleep
[19:02] <ryankask> i don't hibernate. i'll allocate 2gb to be safe
[19:02] <ktheory> it won't connect to the internet afterard
[19:02] <kovu> so how do i trick it into making it think its a usb printer
[19:03] <usr13_> zykotick9: How so?
[19:03] <ryankask> swapiness down to 10
[19:03] <ryankask> see you all
[19:03] <ktheory> any ideas what might be happening?
[19:03] <zykotick9> usr13_: i'm not sure of the details, but was reading about it a short time ago (it went over my head)
[19:03] <damselfly9> kovu; I don't know. but some of these other fine experts might have some ideas
[19:03] <kovu> so what do i ask
[19:04] <antonio__> anyone ever install kdenlive from source?
[19:04] <usr13_> ryankask: zykotick9 There is no good reason to have a swap partition smaller than your RAM.
[19:04] <damselfly9> just state your problem again, with the extra info that it's a parallel printer on a usb-parallel convertor
[19:04] <usr13_> ryankask: How big is your HD?
[19:04] <kovu> anyone know how i can make a parallel printer id itself as a usb printer
[19:04] <auronandace> !checkinstall | antonio__
[19:04] <ubottu> antonio__: checkinstall is a wrapper to "make install", useful for installing programs you compiled. It will create a .deb package, which will be listed in the APT database and can be uninstalled like other packages. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CheckInstall - Read the warnings at the top and bottom of that web page, and DO NOT interrupt CheckInstall while it's running!
[19:04] <SolarisBoy> my system doesn't use swap
[19:04] <scristopher> most likely not kovu
[19:05] <usr13_> zykotick9: The author's logic is flawed.
[19:05] <bekks> SolarisBoy: Which is a very good thing so far. :)
[19:05] <SolarisBoy> ;>
[19:05] <ryankask> why do I need so much swap?
[19:05] <SolarisBoy> cause they say you do.. other than that not sure
[19:05] <usr13_> ryankask: How big is your HD?
[19:05] <damselfly9> kovu; I do know one solution, but it involves spending money
[19:05] <ryankask> usr13_: 128gb
[19:05] <scristopher> two different interfaces and irq is not gonna be happy, lpt will act as a com port in some cases as well so its not feasible unfortunately
[19:06] <bekks> ryankask: For suspend2disk, you need as much swap as your RAM.
[19:06] <usr13_> 128G and you are worried about 6G?
[19:06] <kovu> i want to make a bj-10sx printer work on ubuntu 12.10 but it only detects my parallel to usb converter not my printer
[19:06] <usr13_> ryankask: Good advise:  Make your swap 8G.
[19:06] <ryankask> usr13_: not worried about it. I'm trying to understand
[19:06] <kovu> any ideas how i can change that
[19:07] <usr13_> ryankask: Again, there is no good reason to create a swap partition that is smaller than your RAM.
[19:07] <kovu> ok damselfly what soloution is that
[19:07] <cultavix> guys, I've been looking to replace my GUI for months now and after trying KDE, GNOME3 (F17), MATE, Cinnamon... I've got to say, Unity is MUUCH better than what it used to be! I actually stopped using Ubuntu because of Unity, but hell.... welcome me back!
[19:08] <jordanrain> How can I share a folder over my network using terminal on 12.10?
[19:08] <scristopher> samba
[19:08] <texla> How to add themes to Ubuntu-12.04.1??
[19:08] <scristopher> gnome-look.org
[19:08] <scristopher> kthnx
[19:09] <jordanrain> scristopher, doesn't do it for me. Samba shows them listed but the computer isn't actually sharing them..
[19:09] <texla> scristopher, I got that but how to add to o/s
[19:09] <scristopher> gnome-tweak-tool
[19:09] <scristopher> what kinda themes?
[19:09] <scristopher> gnome-shell, gtk or?
[19:09] <texla> scristopher, Thanks !!
[19:10] <xangua> texla: creat a directory in your home named ".themes" and extract the gtk3 themes there; you can select your themes with tools like gnome-tweak-tool (repository) or ubuntu tweak
[19:10] <damselfly9> kovu; a mini-ethernet print server like an hp jetdirect or a lantronix, would not be terrible expensive second-hand on ebay, and then your printer would count as a "network printer" and ubuntu would use it
[19:10] <scristopher> jordanrain, if its set to share and not sharing then iptables may be blocking shares
[19:10] <scristopher> possibly

[19:12] <yoones> Hi. I'd like to report a bug, but I need a hand identifying from which application the problem comes. When I open a terminal full screen, execute "gpg -d file" and click on the terminal window after the message box pops up, I can't do anything but manually reboot. It's like a jail you can't escape.
[19:12] <ryankask> thanks all for you rhelp
[19:12] <zykotick9> usr13_: ignoring a) my 2.5gb comment and b) hibernate.  having that much swap on a system with 8GB of physical memory, just seems like a waste of space...
[19:13] <usr13_> ryankask: zykotick9 "it's highly recommended that the swap space should be equal to the amount of physical memory (RAM)"
[19:13] <jordanrain> scristopher, it works if I right click a folder and enable sharing, but I need it to work on boot.
[19:13] <jordanrain> So I need to know a command line way of doing it so I can add it to startup options :/
[19:13] <zykotick9> ryankask: and i do agree with usr13_ on that.  if you want to be safe, just have swap=ram.
[19:13] <LIDH> just did some settings to xorg.conf and now it wont display any image, how do I solve it?
[19:13] <ryankask> k thanks for the help. i can always change it later

[19:15] <Em__> Hi
=== ukbkbr is now known as ukdkbr
[19:16] <usr13_> LIDH: "image"?
[19:16] <Em__> Does Ubuntu have a tutorial on how to install it from scratch using only CLI mode. I want to do it that way so I could really understand how to do things and probably get a more concrete foundation in Linux.
[19:16] <zykotick9> Em__: using the mini.iso...
[19:16] <usr13_> LIDH: Remove the xorg.conf file?
[19:17] <designbybeck> I connected to a Server via the COnnect to server SSH in the file browser. I have su access on that server with my username. I can see the files but I can add files to because it says access denied
[19:17] <designbybeck> Any ideas?
[19:17] <LIDH> how?
[19:17] <LIDH> how do i delete?
[19:17] <LIDH> without image
[19:17] <Em__> zykotick9: Yeah, but after installation, I don't know where to go or what to do. Hehehehe, so I am looking for a tutorial or something.
[19:17] <usr13_> LIDH: You mean that you no longer have GUI (Graphic User Interface)?
[19:17] <LIDH> yes
[19:18] <usr13_> LIDH: Ctrl-Alt-F6
[19:18] <LIDH> dont get anything
[19:19] <usr13_> !text | LIDH
[19:19] <ubottu> LIDH: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[19:19] <usr13_> LIDH: Then you can delete or rename your xorg.conf file.

[20:07] <CT1> koegs: googling right away. Thanks
[20:08] <antonio__> I'm trying to install kdenlive from source...I need to install a package that is called libsdl-image-dev
[20:08] <Chriys> Guys question for you what is the difference between <Directory></Directory> and <Directory /var/www></Directory>
[20:08] <yeats> CT1: just a suggestion - to each one's own I guess ;-)
[20:08] <Chriys> Guys question for you what is the difference between <Directory></Directory> and <Directory /var/www></Directory>
[20:09] <antonio__> When I try to install it I get "Unable to locate package libsdl-image-dev"
[20:09] <ewook> yo. Can't remember how to do a step by step selection on what init-scripts to run at bootup (meaning, I step thro every one and select yes or no to run)
[20:09] <ewook> Any pointers?
[20:10] <ewook> Ah, and this will be performed on ubu 12.04.1
[20:10] <xet7> Chriys: you need to define on Apache VirtualHost config what directory is used to server webpages
[20:10] <jrib> ewook: there is no way.  What do you want to do exactly?
[20:10] <yeats> !info libsdl-image-dev
[20:10] <ubottu> Package libsdl-image-dev does not exist in quantal
[20:10] <Styler2go_> how can i combine multiple commands in one command?
[20:10] <Styler2go_> with ";" ?
[20:10] <jrib> Styler2go_: yes
[20:11] <dmd> Anyone have experience with Xenomai
[20:11] <ewook> jrib: There has been :S. I need to kill off a certain init-script that kills of the machine causing a kernel panic :P.
[20:11] <xet7> Styler2go_:  sleep 2m && echo "Hello"
[20:11] <CT1> yeats: absolutely (smiley face) is that not why most of us use any of the plethora of linux distros? freeBSD even.  Try finding what suites you personally and getting help/support from any classic vendor....
[20:11] <Chriys> xet7: this is what i'm doing but i'm trying to figure to what <directory></directory> apply rules
[20:12] <jrib> ewook: if the script is a sysv-init-style script, then you can use sysv-rc-conf.  If it's an upstart script (i.e. it has a .conf in /etc/init (N.B. /etc/init, not /etc/init.d)) then read about manual overrides in the upstart cookbook (google "upstart cookbook")
[20:12] <xet7> Chriys: what rules you need, for what purpose?
[20:13] <koegs> antonio__: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=libsdl-image&searchon=names&suite=quantal&section=all
[20:13] <ewook> jrib: thanks mate.
[20:13] <jrib> Styler2go_: if you use && the second command will only run if the first exits successfully
[20:13] <Styler2go_> nice
[20:14] <kovu> can someone help me install a bj-10sx printer on my ubuntu netbook12.10
[20:15] <LIDH> guys, need help. I followed all the tutorials i could find to get touchscreen working and nothing worked..
[20:15] <LIDH> can't detect the touchscreen device
[20:15] <Chriys> xet7: i want to define a virtual host and when i point my domain to it gives me forbidden cant access to / on this server and on error log of apache it says symbolic links not allowed or can find target link
[20:15] <caravanlizzy> i have an urgent prob
[20:15] <antiface> Hi. I'm new to this, just trying to find the appropriate ubuntu channel for my questions.
[20:15] <caravanlizzy> can anyone help!
[20:15] <Styler2go_> does somebody have some time to help me in a private chat with some php and linux stuff?
[20:15] <LIDH> i know it is connected on PS2 port
[20:16] <LIDH> is there any way to list all PS2 ports?
[20:16] <antiface> My problem is non-important and non-urgent, very low-priority, just looking for the right channel for that kind of discussion. THanks.
[20:17] <caravanlizzy> problem: im experimenting with desktop environments, have gnome and lxde in use and right now tried to start openbox...it opens a grey screen with a mouse cursor but nothing else, all i want is change back to another desktop environment, but i dont know how to sign off wiht not options in openbox!?
[20:17] <Alocer> caravanlizzy: ctrl+alt=Del
[20:17] <damselfly9> kovu; I think the problem isn't with it being a bj-10sx printer, you might get more answers if you asked something like "how do I use a parallel printer on a parallel to usb convertor"
[20:18] <Alocer> ctrl+alt+del*
[20:18] <caravanlizzy> alocer i tried, but nothin happens
[20:18] <antiface> In any case, I would appreciate it if someone can just help find the right channel so I don't waste anyone's time.
[20:18] <Jack3k3> hey guys, I'm doing a fresh install on a uefi pc, I want to dual boot win 8 + ubuntu, so im installing windows8 via usb first, do I need to do anything special with the partitioning first? or just leave some free space for ubuntu to use later
[20:18] <Alocer> caravanlizzy: hold power button ? ??
[20:19] <caravanlizzy> alocer then i turn off pc, but when rebooting i come back to openbox
[20:19] <Alocer> it dosent prompt u to enter ur password ?
[20:19] <caravanlizzy> no
[20:20] <SnapSnap> I'm removing the software sources keys for old packages I don't use anymore, and I found one for Ubuntu-X. What is that?
[20:20] <Alocer> i cant help anymore caravanlizzy sry
[20:20] <caravanlizzy> thanks
[20:20] <dagerik> in cfdisk, what does it matter what type the partition is?
[20:21] <rovalent> would it be a stupid idea to remove resolvconf?
[20:21] <caravanlizzy> problem: im experimenting with desktop environments, have gnome and lxde in use and right now tried to start openbox...it opens a grey screen with a mouse cursor but nothing else, all i want is change back to another desktop environment, but i dont know how to sign off wiht not options in openbox!?
[20:21] <bekks> rovalent: Which "resolvconf" do you mean?
[20:21] <damselfly9> rovalent; you need resolv.conf if you statically specify your dns servers
[20:22] <bekks> damselfly9: You need it always.
[20:22] <auronandace> caravanlizzy: openbox is just a window manager, lxde uses openbox
[20:22] <caravanlizzy> yeah i know that, but how do i come back to a desktop environment
[20:22] <rovalent> bekks: the package resolvconf. so i can use resolv.conf normally
[20:23] <rovalent> (this is on 12.04 LTS server)
[20:23] <auronandace> !resolvconf | rovalent
[20:23] <ubottu> rovalent: resolvconf is a set of scripts that's used to manage /etc/resolv.conf in 12.04 and later, for more information please see: http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/ and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.10/serverguide/network-configuration.html#name-resolution
[20:24] <auronandace> !pm | caravanlizzy
[20:24] <ubottu> caravanlizzy: Please ask your questions in the channel so that other people can help you, benefit from your questions and answers, and ensure that you're not getting bad advice. Please note that some people find it rude to be sent a PM without being asked for permission to do so first.
[20:24] <dcope> has anyone found a more streamlined way to connect a ps3 controller to ubuntu?
[20:25] <zykotick9> dcope: if you are using usb, plug it in?
[20:25] <kovu> can someone help me install a bj-10sx printer on my ubuntu netbook12.10
[20:25] <dcope> zykotick9: i am using bluetooth
[20:25] <antiface> Anyway, the Ubuntu Audio Developers Team doesn't seem to have an IRC channel.. I don't how else to reach them.. have searched online for relevant content..
[20:25] <xet7> Chriys: but what directory permissions you need? Doesn't basic apache config like this work: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1570790/
[20:25] <zykotick9> dcope: ok.  then my answer becomes, use usb.
[20:26] <damselfly9> antiface; you would probably want to go to a channel for alsa developers
[20:26] <xet7> Chriys: do you need password protection or something?
[20:26] <ganto> quit
[20:27] <xet7> Chriys: you need index.html in the root directory, otherwise it shows error
[20:27] <dcope> zykotick9: that's an inconvienent workaround, not a solution.
[20:28] <zykotick9> dcope: actually, seems to answer your origional question perfectly.  best of luck.
[20:28] <Chriys> xet7: already have one and still having this issue
[20:28] <kovu> can someone help me install a bj-10sx printer on my ubuntu netbook12.10
[20:28] <damselfly9> how is usb inconvenient?
[20:28] <dcope> damselfly9: uh because my machine (htpc) is about 10 ft away from my couch and i'm not going to run a cable across the way
[20:29] <termospullo> hey guys
[20:30] <termospullo> I'm trying to install mint from usb but it says something about invalid magic numbers and kernels
[20:30] <damselfly9> dcope; so it's not working under bluetooth?
[20:30] <bekks> !mint | termospullo
[20:30] <ubottu> termospullo: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[20:30] <dcope> damselfly9: it works fine, but you have to tell a program you want to connect beforehand.
[20:30] <dcope> damselfly9: it also must be plugged into usb when connecting. after it's connected, bluetooth works fine.
[20:31] <damselfly9> dcope; what about an infrared-remote usb setup?
[20:31] <dcope> not familiar with that
[20:31] <s0heldy> Does anyone in here have experience running Ubuntu 12.10 on Bochs for Windows?
[20:31] <nimrod10_> I"m using ubuntu 12.04, unity 3d. Every now and again when I'm switching from wired to wireless network-manager refuses to work, ie I can interact with the network manager icon but I can't select any of the wireless networks. It works if I use the command line tool nmcli. Any of you know how to fix this ?
[20:32] <bekks> s0heldy: Why? :)
[20:32] <damselfly9> dcope; it's like cordless keyboards, you have an ir-transmitter at one end and an ir-receiver at your htpc which is plugged into the usb port
[20:32] <s0heldy> bekks: Well, I work at a Microsoft Store, and recently there has been a workaround for the Surface wherein I can run certain x86 programs compiled for ARM.
[20:33] <disharmonic> shouldn't cups-pdf ask for a save location?
[20:33] <damselfly9> dcope; it functins sort of like a tv remote
=== Guest56687 is now known as DaZ
[20:33] <s0heldy> One of which is Bochs, which I can then use to emulate a full x86 machine.
[20:34] <xet7> Chriys: Do you have "Options FollowSymLinks" defined there ?
[20:34] <bekks> s0heldy: Sounds pretty weird. Why emulating x86 on x86 when being abloe to use vbox or hyper-v?
[20:34] <s0heldy> bekks: We're working on solutions for average end-users without access to servers or virtualization.
[20:35] <bekks> s0heldy: hyper-v is a built-in part of windows 8 as you know ;)
[20:35] <s0heldy> bekks: right, but the Surface tablet runs Windows RT.
[20:36] <LIDH> guys, how do I list all available PS2 Ports?
[20:36] <bekks> s0heldy: And on that ARM tablet, you want to run bochs for emulating an x86?
[20:36] <mikehaas763> I've read the msdn and googled but I can't find anything that makes sense to me. What is exactly is the point of a ParameterDirection?
[20:36] <damselfly9> LIDH; there is usually only two, one for keyboard and one for mouse
[20:37] <s0heldy> bekks: yes, because that would enable standard desktop programs to run on it.
[20:38] <bekks> s0heldy: Wouldnt it be easier to run an ARM-enabled distro?
[20:38] <kovu> can someone help me install a bj-10sx printer on my ubuntu netbook12.10
[20:39] <s0heldy> bekks: wouldn't that defy the point? I'm emulating in an effort to escape the restrictions of an ARM-based processor.
[20:39] <bekks> s0heldy: by paying the price of emulation.
[20:39] <LIDH> yes, i know, but this system has a PS2(Keyboard) and another one PS2(Internal for touchscreen)
[20:39] <bekks> s0heldy: which slows down an ARM cpu even more.
[20:39] <LIDH> and i would like to know if the internal is being detected
[20:40] <Phonequer> Can .deb be easily created from autoconf package?
[20:40] <damselfly9> LIDH; do you have a ps/2 mouse?
[20:40] <LIDH> nopw
[20:40] <LIDH> nope
[20:41] <LIDH> it's USB
[20:41] <LIDH> and the system only has 1 External PS2 for Keyboard
[20:41] <LIDH> the other one is Internal
[20:41] <damselfly9> LIDH; then see if it detects a ps/2 mouse, if it does, that will be your touchscreen
[20:41] <LIDH> for the touch controller
[20:41] <s0heldy> bekks: I realize that, but from a retail standpoint, having an ARM-based tablet configurable to run desktop software would be a phenomenal selling point. Most people won't mind it bogging down the system, so long as the end result is achieved as desired.
[20:41] <LIDH> it doesn't
[20:41] <LIDH> that's the problem
[20:42] <LIDH> xinput list doesn't list anything besides a virtual pointer and the mouse itself
[20:42] <bekks> s0heldy: So whats the ubuntu related question then at that point? :)
[20:42] <LIDH> my head is about to blow up. tried so many things..
[20:43] <damselfly9> LIDH; maybe the touchscreen counts as part of your keyboard, sending special characters and such?
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest68220
[20:43] <s0heldy> I'm not at all familiar with Bochs, or even OS emulation as a whole; I'm constantly erroring out when attempting to emulate Ubuntu, and was looking for help configuring it.
[20:43] <LIDH> i did dmesg | grep i8042 and i only get 1 result
[20:44] <LIDH> well..how do i test if it is part of the keyboard?
[20:44] <LIDH> if i click on the screen i get no response
[20:44] <LIDH> touch+
[20:44] <damselfly9> LIDH; I suppose you could open a console window and touch parts of the screen to see if they are echoed back as characters
[20:44] <LIDH> nope, they aren't
[20:44] <LIDH> already did that
[20:45] <LIDH> even used the screen command, but it doesn't work for PS2 or i dont know how to identify it
[20:45] <s0heldy> bekks: forgot to tag you last message
[20:46] <bekks> LIDH: Correct, screen doesnt work with ps2 or anything else but serial ports.
[20:46] <LIDH> the code cat/proc/bus/input/devices
[20:46] <LIDH> only lists know hardware
[20:46] <damselfly9> LIDH; have you looked at the howto yet? http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/html_single/XFree86-Touch-Screen-HOWTO/
[20:46] <LIDH> keyboard, mouse and audio, power etc nothing related to touchscreen neither unknown devices
[20:48] <LIDH> i'm looking at it
=== fox__ is now known as TheFox1993
[20:49] <bregma> LIDH, who makes a this-centure tech like a touchscreen with last-century tech like a PS/2 port?
[20:49] <s0heldy> bregma: some men just want to watch the world burn
[20:49] <LIDH> EBN
[20:49] <LIDH> and its a fairly recent POS
[20:49] <motoko> hey gize
[20:50] <LIDH> it's an i3 sandry bridge with PS/2 touchscreen
[20:50] <bekks> bregma: Touchscreens were invented when PS2 was state of the art.
[20:50] <compdoc> wheres the dark knight when you need him
[20:51] <MoL0ToV> i have the brightness function keys that don't work. howto fix?
[20:51] <kovu> can someone help me install a bj-10sx printer on my ubuntu netbook12.10
[20:51] <LIDH> ok, according to that manual..can't get to the point where are the drivers
[20:52] <jr1> MoLOToV: what hardware
[20:52] <bregma> LIDH, does it have a separate PS/2 connector from the screen overlay?
[20:52] <LIDH> nope
[20:53] <LIDH> only a dedicated to the screen
[20:53] <damselfly9> LIDH; the driver should be included and loadable by xorg, you only need to specify in your xorg.conf
=== fox__ is now known as TheFox1993
[20:53] <LIDH> problem is, i dont have any xorg.conf
[20:54] <bregma> LIDH, how do you know it's a PS/2 device and not some kind of serial or USB device?
[20:54] <damselfly9> LIDH; those can be made automatically
[20:54] <LIDH> because in windows it's detected as PS/2
[20:54] <LIDH> installed windows to test
[20:54] <kovu> can someone help me install a bj-10sx printer on my ubuntu netbook12.10
[20:54] <LIDH> and also, because on USB doesn't detect and com's neither
[20:55] <LIDH> cups, paralell:/dev/usb/lp0
[20:55] <LIDH> how do i create a xorg.conf
[20:55] <LIDH> ?
[20:55] <bregma> LIDH, PS/2 requires specialized drivers in the kernel (like the mouse and keyboard have), you may be out of luck
[20:56] <bregma> LIDH, these days you generally don;t need an xorg.conf, you're better off without one
[20:56] <damselfly9> LIDH; http://www.ehow.com/how_8521031_create-xorgconf-ubuntu.html
[20:56] <bregma> unless you're using the nVidia binary blob driver, which does not play nicely
[20:57] <damselfly9> it appears that touchscreens don't autodetect without an xorg.conf
[20:57] <LIDH> hum..i need to get this delivered by tomorrow 11:30
[20:57] <bregma> they detect just fine if the follow the standard protocols and have a kernel driver
[20:57] <LIDH> oh god..i think i'll have to stop and prey
[20:58] <evon> Can anyone suggest a great virtualization program (paid or free).  I'm presently running winxp with photoshop running inside it and I'm looking to get more performance out of it.  I'm curious to see if better virtualziation software would help
[20:58] <bregma> the xorg confi to handle them is in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d
[20:59] <Joshun> hi
[20:59] <bregma> there's an industry-standard protocol for touch devices established by Microsoft, and there is a kernel driver that handles it by default....  if there's a touch device that does something unusual and the manufacturer does not follow standard protocol, you may be on your own
[21:00] <Joshun> anyone else having problems with separate /home partition unmounting uncleanly upon shotdown?
[21:00] <LIDH> ok..i have a few items in that folder
[21:00] <Joshun> practically every time it boots up it says 'recovering journal' and a load of inodes get corrected
[21:00] <LIDH> 52-egalax-void.conf
[21:00] <LIDH> egalax is my touch driver
[21:01] <damselfly9> LIDH; so you just addthat driver to your xorg.conf
[21:01] <LIDH> and where is the xorg.conf
[21:01] <damselfly9> you have to generate it, I posted a link a few minutes ago
[21:02] <LIDH> i get an error while doing it
[21:02] <damselfly9> hmm. always troubles
[21:02] <LIDH> "fatal server error: server is already active for display 0
[21:02] <LIDH> yes, i'm a lucky guy ;)
[21:02] <damselfly9> knowing the name of your driver is egalax is a start
[21:03] <LIDH> ok. what i know: it's egalax driver, it's PS/2 and doesn't work
[21:03] <userubuntu> hi I am a new ubuntu user, not sure if it is ok to ask for help here
[21:03] <damselfly9> LIDH; the driver probably isn't being loaded by xorg
[21:03] <LIDH> possibly
[21:04] <LIDH> but it's weird, because in windows, without driver it acts like a mouse, if i drag the screen the arrow moves like a touchpad
[21:04] <bregma> Windows has drivers
[21:04] <LIDH> yes, true
[21:04] <bregma> if sudo lsinput does nto show the device, it's not being recognized and initialized by the kernel
[21:05] <userubuntu> I am installing linux 12.04 and there is no way I can get my mouse to work
[21:05] <bregma> it may be recognized as a mouse (pointer) device
[21:06] <LIDH> ok, the code lsinput says it's unknown
[21:06] <LIDH> xinput list doens't show it
[21:06] <LIDH> doesn't*
[21:07] <damselfly9> LIDG; you probably need to manually load the egalax driver
[21:07] <LIDH> tell me how
[21:07] <LIDH> and i will do it..i'm in for anything
[21:07] <LIDH> except setting it on fire
[21:08] <damselfly9> I already suggested xorg.conf, but nregma disagrees
[21:08] <LIDH> i tried to create the xorg.conf using that link, but it doesn't work
[21:08] <LIDH> i get a fatal error
=== dark3n is now known as dark3n|off
[21:09] <LIDH> so basically, either there's a problem with Xorg or the code is wrong
[21:10] <bregma> xorg will not help you if your device does not show up in lsinput
[21:10] <bregma> if the kernel does not recognize your device, no amount of hacking in userspace will make aomething magically appear
[21:10] <damselfly9> http://askubuntu.com/questions/4662/where-is-the-x-org-config-file-how-do-i-configure-x-there
[21:10] <LIDH> ok, i can't do lsinput
[21:10] <userubuntu> i get a message running lsinput open/dev/input/event0 permission denied
[21:10] <LIDH> says it's unknown command~
[21:11] <bregma> 'sudo lsinpu'
[21:11] <LIDH> still unknown command
[21:11] <LIDH> maybe i dont have the package
[21:11] <bregma> sh, you need to install the input-utils package
[21:11] <damselfly9> Xorg drivers do not all need to be kernel drivers
[21:11]  * bregma has way too much stuff installed on his machine
[21:12] <bregma> damselfly9, xorg drivers only work if there are devices for them to work with
[21:12] <LIDH> ok..wait
[21:12] <LIDH> i may have it here..
[21:12] <damselfly9> bregma; yes, and he found it, called egalax
[21:12] <LIDH> but its weird: "at translated set 2 keyboard"
[21:13] <LIDH> it's the only thing i dont know
[21:13] <LIDH> because i don't have anything connected to PS2
[21:13] <LIDH> and it shows up on isa0060/serio0/input0
[21:13] <bregma> sounds hopeful
[21:14] <bregma> LIDH, install the 'xinput' package and run the command 'xinput list' to see what X is recognizing
[21:14] <LIDH> probably it's the AT Translated set 2 keyboard
[21:14] <LIDH> it is detected as ID 11
[21:15] <LIDH> what's the command to get the props
[21:16] <LIDH> got it, but still, nothing helpful
[21:16] <damselfly9> LIDH; this might help, even though it only covers up to 10.04
[21:16] <damselfly9> http://wiki.linuxmce.org/index.php/Egalax-Touchscreen
[21:17] <LIDH> problem is can't find edev
[21:17] <LIDH> already saw that
[21:19] <LIDH> ok, that doesn't work for me..
[21:19] <LIDH> and i tried to install ubuntu 10.10 and i get flashing and weirdcolors on screen..
[21:19] <bregma> Xorg iterates through all detected input devices and tries to match them against its drivers -- if one comes up as a HID-compliant touchscreen, it uses the evdev module to handle it, otherwise it does not
[21:20] <auronandace> LIDH: we don't help with unsupported version here
[21:20] <LIDH> i think i need to map /dev/input/event2 to something
[21:20] <LIDH> i have 12.04
[21:20] <auronandace> LIDH: just making it clear since you mentioned 10.10
[21:21] <LIDH> yes, because i tried to install to follow those tutorials...
[21:21] <LIDH> so, how do i add /dev/input/event2 to input list
[21:21] <LIDH> and make it work
[21:21] <LIDH> to xinput
[21:22] <bregma> LIDH, does 'lsmod | grep -i egalax' show the egalax module is installed?
[21:22] <sam555> hello all!
[21:22] <sam555> how does one configure the panel on the side of the screen in Chrubuntu using the cli?
[21:22] <LIDH> doesn't show anything
[21:23] <auronandace> sam555: chrubuntu?
[21:24] <LIDH> that command doesn't show anything :s
[21:25] <auronandace> LIDH: that means the module isn't loaded then
[21:25] <LIDH> ok, how do i load it then?
[21:25] <auronandace> LIDH: sudo modprobe nameofmodule
[21:25] <LIDH> i have the drivers from Eeti(Egalax)
[21:25] <compdoc> Cherub-untu

=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[21:26] <auronandace> sam555: we only support official ubuntu distros here
[21:27] <sam555> auronandace: where would the panel conf be in the official ubuntu
[21:27] <auronandace> sam555: are you referring to unity panel?
[21:28] <sam555> auronandace: yes, on the left side of the screen
[21:28] <sam555> auronandace: i wanted to be able to configure it in the cli and then rsycn other ubuntu installs with the same config
[21:28] <auronandace> sam555: search for system settings
[21:29] <LIDH> where do i find the kernel modules so i can add a new one there?
[21:29] <damselfly9> LIDH; you'd probably be looking for something like egalax.ko, located somewhere
[21:29] <auronandace> LIDH: install the appropriate driver
[21:31] <Habash> Hi All
[21:31] <sam555> auronandace: kk
[21:32] <LIDH> ok, installed the driver
[21:32] <bregma> so it shows up in lsmod now?
[21:32] <LIDH> nope
[21:32] <LIDH> it isn't being loaded
[21:32] <bregma> :(
[21:32] <auronandace> bregma: lsmod shows what modules are loaded, not installed
[21:33] <LIDH> so, i installed as if it was installed using usb

[21:42] <Chriys> My postfix is unable to send email outsite of the local network. Do you have any solution ?
[21:42] <trism> Kroach: yes, just change those icons in your icon theme, though finding all the correct icon names can be a bit of a pain
[21:42] <Chriys> thanks for your help
[21:42] <auronandace> Naphatul: the xubuntu-desktop package is a meta package that also includes some apps for the xfce desktop
[21:43] <capitaninsaneoh> Has anyone used SAMBA 4 with swat 2?  I'm looking at updating to it
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest27682
[21:43] <bekks> capitaninsaneoh: Someone already did it - but what is your actual question/problem?
[21:44] <Naphatul> auronandace, does xubuntu ship with more apps besides those default ones?
[21:44] <Kroach> trism: do they have some distinct names, like "appname-indicator"?
[21:44] <auronandace> Naphatul: not sure what you mean sorry
[21:44] <trism> Kroach: they mostly have generic names actually
[21:44] <Kroach> damn
[21:45] <antiface> Anyone know where I can find with audio setup? Can't seem to find any relevant channels..
[21:45] <kingbeast> Naphatul, yes it has a package manager to install programs from
[21:45] <Naphatul> auronandace, besides the stuff that comes in the xfce desktop metapackage, does xubuntu ship anything extra?
[21:45] <antiface> Bugs are confirmed.. just need someone from Audio dev team or someone who cares. ;-)
[21:45] <newbie_to_ubuntu> hey
[21:45] <auronandace> Naphatul: oh, no, it is as you said: ubuntu minimal install plus xubuntu-desktop package
[21:45] <newbie_to_ubuntu> so I've been running ubuntu 12.04 for awhile very happily
[21:46] <newbie_to_ubuntu> I have to also install ubuntu 10.04
[21:46] <damselfly9> antiface; do you mean low-level driver bugs?
[21:46] <newbie_to_ubuntu> i need help with the install there are a number of things that went wrong
[21:46] <Kroach> trim: ok, thanks
[21:46] <antiface> Low-level, yes, but not drivers.. packages
[21:46] <kingbeast> newbie_to_ubuntu, good, ask away
[21:46] <antiface> Same thing I guess.
[21:46] <Kroach> trism: ok, thanks
[21:46] <newbie_to_ubuntu> first thing is that I installed a 32-bit OS and only have 3 GB of RAM available?
[21:46] <damselfly9> antiface; is it the alsa packages with the bugs?
[21:46] <Naphatul> auronandace, yeah but what i'm trying to figure out is if ubuntu minimal + xubuntu-desktop == xubuntu
[21:47] <newbie_to_ubuntu> but bigger issue #2 is that I have no internet connection
[21:47] <newbie_to_ubuntu> nothing not even eth0
[21:47] <auronandace> Naphatul: yes, exactly
[21:47] <antiface> No, it's some bizarre conflict with libjack-jackd2 and jackd2
[21:47] <bekks> newbie_to_ubuntu: 3.2GB, and yes, thats correct for a non-PAE kernel.
[21:47] <newbie_to_ubuntu> what do you mean non-PAE?
[21:47] <antiface> It's been documented, I found reports online..
[21:47] <Chriys> My postfix is unable to send email outsite of the local network. Do you have any solution ?
[21:47] <koegs> Naphatul: with xubuntu-desktop you will get the "full xubuntu", with xfce-desktop only the xfce core applications
[21:47] <damselfly9> antiface; I was just wonder whose responsibility it would be
[21:48] <antiface> Me too, I've been searching everywhere to find the right person to contact.
[21:48] <bekks> newbie_to_ubuntu: "Page Address Extension" - using a 32bit kernel without it, the kernel cant address more. Using PAE, it can, but only up to 4GB per thread
[21:48] <antiface> Not for me, I can wait, it's not urgent or important.. but someone somewhere should be interested in it..
[21:48] <newbie_to_ubuntu> ok
[21:48] <newbie_to_ubuntu> so how do i fix it?
[21:48] <kingbeast> Naphatul, why don't you just go to the Xubuntu website and do your research on it there.
[21:48] <newbie_to_ubuntu> change the kernel?
[21:48] <auronandace> !pae | newbie_to_ubuntu
[21:48] <ubottu> newbie_to_ubuntu: To use more than ~3.2GB RAM on a 32bit system you can install the PAE-enabled kernel. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnablingPAE for more info
[21:48] <bekks> newbie_to_ubuntu: You have to install a pae kernel.
[21:49] <newbie_to_ubuntu> ahh okay
[21:49] <antiface> In any case, I added a "affects me too" to the bug page on Launchpad..
[21:49] <newbie_to_ubuntu> so what about the bigger issue the problem of no internet connection?
[21:49] <newbie_to_ubuntu> that one I need help with
[21:49] <damselfly9> it appears libjack-jackd2 was inherited from debian, so ubuntu's audio dev team probably won't help
[21:49] <antiface> damselfly9: it's strange, I expected there would be an IRC channel for Ubuntu audio stuff.
[21:49] <antiface> Oh ok.. thanks.
[21:50] <newbie_to_ubuntu> thanks ubottu and bekks
[21:50] <damselfly9> antiface; there is a debian channel here on freenode
[21:50] <newbie_to_ubuntu> so what about the issue of no internet connection?
[21:50] <kingbeast> newbie_to_ubuntu, is it a laptop?
[21:50] <antiface> Ok.. will check it out.
[21:51] <newbie_to_ubuntu> yes it is a laptop
[21:51] <antiface> I'm confused, though, I'm running Ubuntu Quantal (12.10).. still new to this

[21:51] <kingbeast> newbie_to_ubuntu, model#
[21:51] <antiface> I'm not running Debian..

[21:52] <Chriys> Hi please i need help. My postfix is unable to send email outsite of the local network. Do you have any solution ?
[21:52] <newbie_to_ubuntu> the networking works fine on ubuntu 12.04 LTS which is what i'm using right now
[21:52] <damselfly9> antiface; ubuntu started out based on debian, and inherited a lot of it's innards from that

[21:53] <antiface> I've been doing sound design for 20 years and audio setups are what I hate the most. ;-)
[21:53] <damselfly9> you're welcome, maybe the debianites will even help
[21:53] <antiface> In any case, Linux is a million times better than Windows Vista that I was using. ;-)
[21:54] <antiface> Yes, the debianites will surely come to the rescue. ;-)
[21:54] <damselfly9> the problem with libjack-jackd2 started there in debian, anyways
[21:55] <damselfly9> and it seems no distro actually solves a bug problem if they can point the finger at someone else

[22:11] <TheLordOfTime> as escott just suggested
[22:12] <jrtappers> escott, is there a way to disable authentication, the ssh server will only be accessable from within another ssh tunnel, so its secure

[22:33] <IamAnTh0ny> :)
[22:35] <waveform> Hello all!
[22:35] <TheLordOfTime> MrBoss, perhaps you're looking for #ubuntu-steam?  since CS beta i think is a steam-on-ubuntu thing, i think you'll get better help from there...
[22:35] <waveform> Running Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS and has been very stable
[22:36] <waveform> Today I replaced a 2TB WD Caviar Green with a 3TB WD Caviar Green (both were formatted NTFS due to prior windows use)
[22:36] <waveform> I went ahead and kept the ntfs formatting just because there are files on the drive etc
[22:37] <waveform> anyway, I am attempting to transfer files to the new 3TB both via the network (SCP,SMB) and by hooking up the old 2TB via USB
[22:37] <waveform> odd thing is.... the system keeps freezing completely
[22:37] <waveform> it is headless so I can't see what the screen is displaying but from looking at syslog I'm not seeing any errors
[22:37] <waveform> it literally just stops
[22:37] <waveform> anyone have any guidance?
[22:38] <bekks> waveform: I'd not use NTFS on the drive.
[22:38] <waveform> yea bekks? Do you think that could be what's causing it?
[22:39] <waveform> bekks: would you recommend ext3 or 4?
[22:39] <damselfly9> waveform; does it stop at any particular point?
[22:39] <waveform> I am transferring some large files... 1-2GB each
=== toms is now known as Guest97279
[22:39] <waveform> it doesn't seem to stop at any certain point
[22:39] <bekks> waveform: ext4 - and yes, since ntfs is implemented as userspace (ntfs-3g), I bet your CPU just bails out when writing NTFS.
[22:39] <waveform> just after 3 or 4
[22:40] <waveform> ah yea bekks?
[22:40] <waveform> another clue
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[22:40] <damselfly9> ntfs is pretty bad
[22:40] <waveform> I have another 2TB drive that is also NTFS
[22:40] <waveform> gotcha
[22:40] <waveform> alright welllll I will wipe the drive
[22:40] <damselfly9> ntfs-3g is pretty bad
[22:40] <waveform> and ext4 it
[22:40] <waveform> cool, let me try that
[22:40] <waveform> will report back
[22:40] <damselfly9> I'd personally recommend xfs or jfs though
[22:41] <waveform> other clue is the system also froze when trying to copy the files to one of the other NTFS drives in the box
[22:41] <waveform> sooo likely so
[22:41] <waveform> btw... the 3TB... was a warranty replacement from WD for a 2TB that was failing :)

[22:46] <heliocentrique> hey guys, I don't get something : Why I have to enable "Ubuntu Partners" so Skype and other proprietary software be available in the repository ? I thought Ubuntu was supposed to be an OS for the mass ?
[22:46] <Zw> Hi! I have a folder with 3000 names and want to write every filename in the folder to a txt file. Is that possible over ssh?
[22:46] <damselfly9> airglide; that means you need to set the file writeable
[22:47] <damselfly9> airglide; once it's writable, that command should work
[22:47] <allgood38> heliocentrique: Other distros don't give you the option for propriotary stuff at all
[22:47] <airglide> with what command? chomd +?
[22:47] <airglide> *chmod
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
[22:47] <allgood38> airglide: It's not so much a good idea to change permissions on individual files in a system directory
[22:48] <damselfly9> airglide; I suppose "sudo chmod 777 filename"
[22:48] <allgood38> airglide: use the command you had before, but prepend sudo
[22:48] <airglide> doesn't work
=== codezombie|away is now known as codezombie
[22:48] <allgood38> airglide: sudo echo "text" >> defaults.list
[22:48] <airglide> then i get the same error
[22:49] <damselfly9> airglide, did you say the chmod command I said also failed ?
[22:49] <heliocentrique> allgood38: I don't use propietary stuff that much, only Skype because my girlfriend insisted. But on Archlinux you simply do "pacman -S skype"... on Ubuntu it's more complicated... you have to find the option to enable it (assuming you knew it existed before googling it)... I just think it's counter intuitive and far away from the "it just works" philosophy
[22:50] <bekks> !skype | allgood38
[22:50] <ubottu> allgood38: To install Skype on Ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype - To record on Skype, check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto - Please use open protocols instead if you can, see !Ekiga
[22:50] <zykotick9> Zw: "ls /path/to/folder > newfile.txt"
[22:50] <bekks> heliocentrique: Thats not as complicated as on Archlinux :P
[22:50] <airglide> no haven't tried chmod yet
[22:50] <away> heliocentrique, sudo apt-get install skype, no?
[22:51] <heliocentrique> away: no, you have to edit the file to enable "Ubuntu Partners"
[22:51] <bekks> away: Or just read the article ubottu just posted. :)
[22:52] <heliocentrique> bekks: well... it's exactly the problem... I have to read an article to install Skype. Ubuntu is officially more complicated than Archlinux : P

[22:53] <allgood38> heliocentrique: Can't you enable partner repo's at install time?
[22:53] <damselfly9> heliocentrique; just curious, what is your reason for switching for archlinux to ubuntu?
[22:53] <bekks> heliocentrique: Reading an article to know WHY you are doing something and how it works is - not complicated.
[22:54] <goddard> There is archbsd now
[22:54] <heliocentrique> damselfly9: I need to sell my computer, so I installed an easy-to-use OS on it for the mass
[22:55] <Zw> tnx zykotick9
[22:55] <damselfly9> that's sad
[22:55] <goddard> all the linux distrobutions need to merge into one massive distro
[22:56] <heliocentrique> damselfly9: not really, better selling it than trowing it in the recycle
[22:56] <allgood38> goddard: lol wat
[22:56] <heliocentrique> bin*
[22:56] <goddard> all distro should just become Ubuntu
[22:57] <damselfly9> every distro has it's strong points, thats why each person has a preference
[22:57] <goddard> nah each distro is just a power grab
[22:58] <goddard> one distro to rule them all
[22:58] <heliocentrique> allgood38: I did not see any prompt to enable that, I'll double-check thanks
[22:58] <damselfly9> goddard, they are quite different from each other
[22:59] <allgood38> heliocentrique: Cool, I haven't gone through the install process for a long time, so I could be wrong :P
[23:00] <dw-> using transmission with a private tracker... easy fix?  i can get the cookies.txt. where do i put it?
[23:00] <goddard> damselfly9, nah not really
[23:00] <smw> dw-, private trackers don't require cookies
[23:01] <dw-> smw: ok well im getting auth failed.. how can i login with my u/p
[23:01] <smw> dw-, private trackers put the auth data in the torrent file
[23:02] <smw> dw-, you should not need to
[23:02] <damselfly9> goddard, many in the linux community would never accept using ubuntu due to canonical's spyware issues
[23:02] <dw-> smw: well i got the torrent from a non private site.. so maybe ill try redownload after login.. but it says dupe torrent so ill have to remove the existing :/
[23:03] <goddard> damselfly9, well thats dumb because you can just uninstall it or even compile Unity yourself
[23:03] <smw> dw-, if you get the tracker url (including auth key) from the torrent file, you can add it
[23:04] <Tux> hey, I have a Satellite L755 machine that my brother is trying to install Ubuntu on, but it's stuck at "Removing conflicting operating system files..."
[23:04] <Tux> the machine had a failed install of Ubuntu
[23:05] <Tux> it has been stuck there for a 30+ minutes now

[23:05] <dw-> smw: cool hack.. but remove and redownload worked. thanks :)
[23:05] <Tux> i'll give that a go
[23:05] <allgood38> Tux: Also check for memory errors, as in memtest86 the ram

[23:08] <noproblems> I can help you with your wifi problem.
[23:11] <Tux> okay I'll let the memtest86+ run for an hour
[23:11] <waveform> wow
[23:11] <waveform> huge difference
[23:11] <waveform> using ext4

[23:11] <waveform> the cpu usage was insane before
[23:12] <k1l> waveform: you had ubuntu running on ntfs?
[23:12] <waveform> when writing
[23:12] <waveform> noo just a storage drive k1l
[23:12] <waveform> that was from a windows box
[23:12] <damselfly9> waveform; yes, ntfs-3g is really bad
[23:12] <waveform> good to know
[23:12] <waveform> I'll have to convert my other 2TB drives :)
[23:12] <k1l> waveform: ah ok. yes. ext4 is way better to use for linux only storage
[23:12] <waveform> hard part is clearing them off to convert
[23:13] <damselfly9> waveform; if you need a drive for windows though, ntfs-3g is the only writable option
[23:13] <waveform> yea k1l  it was literally freezing my entire server
[23:13] <waveform> yea damselfly9
[23:13] <waveform> these will live in a linux box now
[23:13] <waveform> so its all good
[23:13] <escott> waveform, you should not be using ntfs unless you have a working windows system

[23:18] <ArmoredDragoon> samba only transfers at 9MByte/sec
[23:19] <waveform> hmmm

[23:19] <mediaslave> Hi, I am getting a seg fault: http://pastebin.com/CQ2B6Dzv  Anyone care to help?
[23:19] <damselfly9> waveform; did you say these were usb drives?
[23:20] <Viking667> hello. I'm having slightly weird problems. I can't ping hosts by name, unless I'm root. As an ordinary user, "ping www.google.com" comes up with "unknown host", yet doing the same as root works fine.
[23:20] <urlwolf> I have ubutu shell remix
[23:20] <waveform> the new 3TB drive is SATA
[23:20] <urlwolf> would like to try unity
[23:20] <waveform> never had any problem like this until I introduced that new drive
[23:20] <waveform> don't think it is power related I've got a 650W powersupply in there and minimal power usage
[23:21] <michaelb_> I need help in getting my wireless up and running
[23:21] <waveform> all green drives
[23:21] <urlwolf> unity is intalled, but when trying to install ubuntu-desktop it has a lot of conflicts
[23:21] <urlwolf> is there an easy way to do this?
[23:21] <damselfly9> waveform; is it locking up on the reads or the writes?
[23:21] <waveform> writes
[23:21] <waveform> reading works fine
[23:21] <waveform> system has locked up writing to 2 different drives now... really odd
[23:22] <waveform> I am going to trouble shoot a bit more
[23:22] <waveform> next step will be to unhook the 3TB and try to write to one of my other 2TB drives
[23:22] <damselfly9> waveform; could be driver problems with yourr sata controller
[23:22] <waveform> see if it persists... really odd stuff
[23:22] <waveform> yea I'm thinking the same damsel
[23:22] <waveform> hmm
[23:23] <waveform> hmm is there a command to see which controller my drive is currently hooked up to?
[23:23] <mediaslave> ? anyone?
[23:23] <waveform> I believe there are multiple on my mobo, again it is headless so from ssh would be best
[23:23] <damselfly9> waveform; it will say in your dmesg
[23:23] <waveform> ah yea
[23:24] <damselfly9> it could be something as simple as a bad cable

[23:37] <oeeve> Hi, I'm currently running 12.04 without monitor, using vnc for remote control. But when I unplugged the monitor, the resolution got stuck at 800x600, what would be the best way to proceed as to "force" a higher display resolution without monitor connected? ...or does the problem lie in vnc?
[23:39] <damselfly9> oeeve; is this vga or dvi?
[23:40] <IamAnTh0ny> hey guys whats the difference between ext2 and ext4??
[23:40] <damselfly9> IamAnTh0ny; journaling
[23:41] <oeeve> damselfly9 There are both vga and dvi ports on my remote computer, but no monitor connected. When I disconnected it, the resolution(also in vnc) went down to 800x600. What would be best best way to "force" it higher?
[23:41] <waveform> soo this motherboard is an older one

[23:42] <damselfly9> oeeve; you can get a bga terminator which attaches to the vga port and fools the computer into thinking it has a monitor
[23:43] <damselfly9> oeeve; sorry vga terminator
[23:43] <donniezazen> Hi
[23:44] <oeeve> damselfly9 aha, maby thats the easiest trick:) I'll google and see if its easy to make one;p thanks;)
[23:45] <damselfly9> waveform; there is such thing as sata1/sata2/sata3, maybe your controller isn't completely compatible
[23:46] <waveform> hmmm
[23:46] <waveform> I do have a PCI SATA card I could throw in there

[23:47] <waveform> cpu usage is minimal
[23:47] <waveform> 0.43 right now
[23:49] <damselfly9> if that 0.43 is percent of cpu, it's good. if that system load, not so good
[23:50] <k1l> damselfly9: even system load would be ok.
[23:50] <k1l> everything under 1 means everything gets calculated without waiting
[23:50] <waveform> umm this is from htop
[23:50] <waveform> Load Average
[23:51] <waveform> should be CPU load
