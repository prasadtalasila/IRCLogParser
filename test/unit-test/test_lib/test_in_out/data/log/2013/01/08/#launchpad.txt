[07:26] <ricotz> hello, please cancel those stuck builds https://launchpad.net/~super-friends/+archive/daily/+build/4197265 https://launchpad.net/~super-friends/+archive/daily/+build/4193592 https://launchpad.net/~ajf/+archive/transmission-remote-gtk-unstable/+build/4186079 https://launchpad.net/~super-friends/+archive/daily/+build/4191214
[13:20] <imexil> Hi I'm really struggling to assign another "Also affects project" to Bug #1049522
[13:20] <ubot5> bug 1049522 in auctex (Ubuntu) "auctex installs emacs23 even when emacs24 is installed" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1049522
[13:21] <imexil> the package "ecb" has the same problem but does not exist on launchpad so it seems I can not mark it as "affected project"
[13:21] <imexil> so what should I do now?
[13:28] <dpm> hi all, quick question: if I change the name of a team which has got a PPA, is there any way to make the change transparent to the PPA subscribers? Or will they need to update the subscription to point to the PPA with the new team name?

[14:05] <czajkowski> dimitern: the latter
[14:05] <czajkowski> bah
[14:05] <czajkowski> dpm: the latter
[14:05] <czajkowski> imexil: not sure what you mean
[14:05] <dpm> czajkowski, ah, I was fearing that, thanks for confirming
[14:06] <czajkowski> np
[14:06] <imexil> czajkowski: well the bug is currently only affecting the auctex package
[14:06] <czajkowski> 2nd person to ask in as many mins ;)
[14:06] <imexil> and I just want to add that it also affects the ecb packages
[14:07] <imexil> only going on "also affects project" does not help since there is no "ecb" project present in launchpad (though there is the _package_ ecb)
[14:08] <czajkowski> can you add upstream info on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/auctex/+bug/1049522/+choose-affected-product
[14:08] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1049522 in auctex (Ubuntu) "auctex installs emacs23 even when emacs24 is installed" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[14:10] <imexil> well then I have to specifie the name and when I change auctex to ecb I get: "There is no project in Launchpad named "ecb". Please search for it as it may be registered with a different name."
[14:10] <imexil> and I'm back at square one so to say
[14:10] <czajkowski> imexil: so it's not possible, if there was an upsteam you could link to the upstream bug
[14:11] <imexil> OK I just assumed that _every_ package in ubunt also can be addressed in launchpad
[14:12] <imexil> which let's me wonder how one reports a bug in ecb on ubuntu ....
[14:12] <mgz> imexil: you can assign a bug to the ubuntu package, but not always the upstream
[14:12] <mgz> note that the package name may well not be the same as the command you run or the name of the project
[14:13] <imexil> OK that would be sufficient, but how do I do that wrt to "Also affects project"
[14:14] <imexil> AH! It's then "Also affects distribution" ... that was not very obvious to me. Sorry.
[14:15] <imexil> That should probably better be called: "Also affects package/distribution"
[14:16] <mgz> right, it's distribution, not project
[14:16] <imexil> OK thanks.
[14:16] <mgz> I agree it's not terribly clear

[18:39] <chrisccoulson> is launchpad meant to be adding comments to mozilla's bugzilla? (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=827019#c12)
[18:39] <ubot5> Mozilla bug 827019 in en-GB / English (United Kingdom) "404 error when using Chambers (UK) search" [Normal,Assigned]
[18:39] <chrisccoulson> i thought that was disabled, but i just noticed this
[19:09] <alesage> hi, I've got a bzr problem, wonder if someone can offer an opinion on this http://paste.ubuntu.com/1510284/
[19:10] <lifeless> it looks like a url ? :)
[19:11] <lifeless> alesage: what version of bzr is that ?
[19:11] <lifeless> alesage: I seem to recall some issues with pulling from stacked repos a while back
[19:12] <alesage> lifeless, hmm--remedy would just be an apt-get update?
[19:13] <lifeless> alesage: if its that problem, yes
[19:13] <alesage> ok lifeless, we shall attempt thx :)
[19:46] <ricotz> hello, could someone bump the buildscore of those builds please https://launchpad.net/~gnome3-team/+archive/gnome3/+sourcepub/2917132/+listing-archive-extra
[19:50] <czajkowski> ricotz: all_of them?
[19:50] <czajkowski> ricotz: https://wiki.canonical.com/Launchpad/PolicyandProcess/PPAPriorityPolicy
[19:50] <ricotz> yes, both :)
[19:51] <ricotz> (this is not a public site)
[19:51] <czajkowski> ricotz: also this channel isn't really watched past 6pm UTC as there is only one person on maintence atm in Launchpad and the other 2 are in AU timezone and I finished work almost  2 hours ago
[19:52] <ricotz> there is currently a dependency issue which should get fixed with this build
[19:52] <czajkowski> ricotz: please file a question https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad
[19:52] <ricotz> czajkowski, oh, i see, thanks
[19:53] <ricotz> alright, i will just leave it then and let it climb the queue
[19:53] <czajkowski> ricotz: possibly wise, everytime a project is bumped it pushes past another one that has been waiting :)
[19:54] <ricotz> czajkowski, yeah, have a nice evening then, and don't care about this :)

[20:48] <alkisg> Hi, I can't understand why https://code.launchpad.net/~vagrantc/ltsp/ltsp-debian-packaging fails to sync... could someone see any reason?

[22:06] <fginther> lifeless, alesage and I have been working on http://paste.ubuntu.com/1510284/ ...
[22:06] <fginther> with no success
[22:07] <fginther> our system already has the latest precise packages, we also found https://bugs.launchpad.net/bzr/+bug/522637 which mentions a repair step

[22:08] <fginther> the repair attempt results in: "bzr: ERROR: RemoteRepository(bzr+ssh://bazaar.launchpad.net/%2Bbranch/libdbusmenu/.bzr/) cannot canonicalize CHKs."
[22:08] <fginther> Was wondering if anything else comes to mind :-)
[23:07] <Sweetshark> Hi everyone, can you please kill https://launchpad.net/~bdcomp/+archive/backports/+build/4198934? It ran out of disc space and blocks a buildd? I notified the owner of the build already. thx.
[23:10] <StevenK> Sweetshark: I've killed it.
[23:14] <Sweetshark> StevenK: awesome thx.
[23:27] <lifeless> fginther: sorry, nothing does.
[23:27] <lifeless> fginther: perhaps ask jam ?
[23:28] <fginther> thanks, I'll do that
