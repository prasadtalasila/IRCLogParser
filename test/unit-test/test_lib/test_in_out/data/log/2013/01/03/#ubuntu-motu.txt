[15:43] <micahg> MOTU meeting in 17 minutes?
[15:48] <tumbleweed> I removed those from the schedule because nobody has been pitching up for a while
[15:51] <micahg> :(
[15:51] <Laney> :( indeed
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[16:22] <highvoltage> happy new year micahg, tumbleweed and Laney (and others who might be reading)
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[16:56] <Laney> and to you highvoltage
[16:56] <Laney> good holidays?
[17:00] <highvoltage> well, I actually managed to relax a bit the last week
[18:08] <alo21> barry, hi... may I ask you a thing?

[19:00] <barry> alo21: sure!
[19:01] <alo21> barry, I would like to know if I could make a request to join ubuntu-development-team...if not, what should I do
[19:02] <alo21> barry, this is my developer's activity: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AlessandroLosavio/Packaging
[19:03] <barry> alo21: have you seen this page? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopers
[19:04] <alo21> barry, yea... I made dome development stuffs, but I do not know if it's enough what I did, to be recognize as a developer
[19:05] <barry> alo21: it depends on what kind of developer you want to be, or what activities you want to be able to perform.  e.g. are you looking for upload rights of some kind?
[19:09] <alo21> barry, I would like to fix bugs,  but if possible I would like to have upload rights. In fact I am working/worked on fixing/syncing/merging
[19:12] <barry> alo21: great! fixing bugs is easy, and from your page it looks like you've had some success with that.  becoming a prospective or contributing developer might be a good first step.  from there, you might apply to the ubuntu developer membership board to gain upload rights per-package, or for a package set, or for a core developer.  for the latter, you'll need a lot of experience, good understanding of the ubuntu development process,
[19:12] <barry> positive advocates, and patience (we are already booked for the next 6 weeks ;)
[19:18] <alo21> barry, OK. Thanks for your time
[19:18] <barry> alo21: no problem, and good luck
