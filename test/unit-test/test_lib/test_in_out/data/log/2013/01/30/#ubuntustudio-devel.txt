[13:06] <smartboyhw> zequence, am I wrong or is it that whenever I am online scott-work is offline?:(
[14:03] <len-nb> smartboyhw, Scott is hard for anyone to catch.
[14:03] <smartboyhw> len-nb, LOL
[14:03] <len-nb> still he is more active this cycle.
[14:04] <smartboyhw> len-nb, and that is a good thing:)
[14:12] <len-nb> micahg, this is the promised poke about our -settings package. I am sort of half way out the door. If you have questions I should be around about 2100 UTC (1300PST)
[14:13] <micahg> len-nb: thanks, I'll try to take a look this evening

[15:29] <zequence> smartboyhw: Have you tried any of the testing tools?
[15:29] <zequence> UTAH is one
[15:30] <zequence> There's another one. I've forgotten its name
[15:37] <smartboyhw> zequence, uh?
[15:37] <smartboyhw> autopilot?
[15:37] <smartboyhw> autopkgtest?
[15:40] <zequence> Yeah, autopilot
[15:40] <zequence> smartboyhw: I think it would be good to do some automated testing for our default applications, and see if we can catch any errors
[15:40] <zequence> I think some of them we never even open
[15:41] <smartboyhw> zequence, OK. But since I'm a piece of crap in programming, you can try to do it:D
[15:41] <smartboyhw> I'm still learning:P
[15:43] <zequence> I see. Well, that is one quite important part for us to be better at. I shall add that on myself to get done
[15:45] <smartboyhw> zequence, bzr branch lp:ubuntu-autopilot-tests if you want to play with it
[15:47] <smartboyhw> zequence, if you want to merge it tell me (strangely I had merge rights since I was testcase admin)
