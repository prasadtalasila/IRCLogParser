[18:17] <brousch> My step-dad read that
[18:18] <brousch> I read 1 chapter, looked at the pile, and said no thanks
[18:18] <rick_h_> lol, I do recall when I first started it took me 3 days to read the first 30 pages
[18:18] <rick_h_> I finished the rest of the book the next day
[18:41] <brousch> snap-l: Did you see this? http://dvice.com/archives/2013/01/why-we-love-rob.php
[18:42] <snap-l> Yeah, I have
[18:43] <snap-l> Apparently there's also a pole-dancing robot, if you're into that sort of thing.

[20:49] <snap-l> Users who don't need to support XML parameters should disable XML parsing entirely by placing one of the following snippets inside an application initializer.
[20:49] <snap-l> What... the...fuck...
[21:12] <greg-g> so, should I take this news today to the extreme and be prejudice against someone in an election because they work on RoR?
[21:13] <greg-g> (a w3c election)
[21:17] <snap-l> Unless there's a good reason for it, I'd suggest no.
[21:19] <snap-l> Now, the reaon question of the day: should I keep listening to "Fear of a Black Planet" that Random Music selected for me?
[21:19] <greg-g> I know I know ;), my network was laggy otherwise there would have been a ";)" in the above
[21:22] <brousch> I am working with tastypie today and it's really nice
