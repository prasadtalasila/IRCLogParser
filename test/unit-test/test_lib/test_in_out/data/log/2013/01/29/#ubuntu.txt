[00:03] <cheeky> hello....i got help on a problem here: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.lang.python/-R6JfEBhXw0
[00:04] <cheeky> the person who helped me boiled my problem down to me not having the python header files to compile the C code for pycrypto
[00:04] <cheeky> specifically: Here comes your problem: you do not have the Python header files,
[00:04] <cheeky> required to compile the C code used by pycrypto (for speed in certain
[00:04] <cheeky> operations, because they are quite resource-intensive).  Where can you
[00:04] <cheeky> get them?  I don’t know, ask your distro.  They are usually in a
[00:04] <cheeky> package ending with -dev or -devel (depending on your distro; human
[00:05] <cheeky> distros do not bother with this and ship them along with the rest of
[00:05] <FloodBot1> cheeky: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[00:05] <cheeky> the thing…)
[00:06] <histo> cheeky: have you searched the software center?
[00:06] <Savage_CL> How do i run things at login with 12.10?
[00:06] <histo> !info pycryptopp | cheeky
[00:06] <ubottu> cheeky: Package pycryptopp does not exist in quantal
[00:07] <cheeky> not sure what to search for tbh
[00:07] <histo> !info python-pycryptopp | cheeky
[00:07] <ubottu> cheeky: python-pycryptopp (source: pycryptopp): Python wrappers for the Crypto++ library. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.5.29-1build1 (quantal), package size 356 kB, installed size 1072 kB
[00:07] <Tex_Nick> Savage_CL:  Startup Applications
[00:07] <cheeky> histo: very nice...thank you
[00:07] <histo> cheeky: I would start searching for pycrypto   wouldn't you
[00:07] <Savage_CL> well yes, but where is it, Tex_Nick ?
[00:07] <kaiblocks> oh man. I tried the command sudo fuser -cuk /var/cache/apt/archives/lock and my system froze.
[00:07] <Tex_Nick> Savage_CL: what distro
[00:07] <paoloumali> i have git installed and am trying to use bitbucket through ssh. I can easily add the public key on bitbucket admin page, but I don't get the point of a particular step(step 4) https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Set+up+SSH+for+Git. maybe someone can shed light
[00:08] <Tex_Nick> Savage_CL:  if you're using unity ... in dash home type "Startup"
[00:08] <cheeky> histo: yes...that would have saved me installing xchat just to ask that question :)

[00:11] <TheFizzMeister> Hello. I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my desktop last night, and its acting weird with regards to the wireless adapter.
[00:11] <Savage_CL> Ah, thank you.
[00:11] <histo> !details | TheFizzMeister
[00:11] <ubottu> TheFizzMeister: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[00:11] <TheFizzMeister> Specifically, it's seeing that my wireless network (and the ones around me) are available, and I'm putting in the correct password, I'm sure.
[00:12] <tripelb> wow exit made lernel panic. lots of lines. switching back to text.console. then no prompt
[00:12] <TheFizzMeister> But it repeatedly fails to connect. Specifically, I get the 'Disconnected from [my wireless network]' message repeatedly.
[00:12] <TheFizzMeister> I'm using a LinkSys Wireless-G USB adapter.
[00:13] <histo> TheFizzMeister: what chipset is on the adapter?
[00:13] <TheFizzMeister> And I assume that it's not necessarily a driver issue because it actually detects the wireless network, but it just fails to either connect or to sustain a connection.
[00:13] <kaiblocks> Wow! Great news, I think I got this fixed
[00:13] <histo> TheFizzMeister: it still could be a driver issue
[00:13] <padhu> Ubuntians, I need an driver for EPSON FX 2175 printer on ubuntu 12.04
[00:13] <tripelb> hard shutdown. can only diacuss now
[00:14] <_helios_> TheFizzMeister: I have a LinkSysWireless-G USB adapter and I could never get it to work instead I spent 13 bucks on a Belkin Wireless G Adapter and have had no problems with it.
[00:14] <TheFizzMeister> ohir, damn it. I just looked up what the chipset was to get it working on Windows 7 (I'm dual-booting) and closed it. Lemme find it again.
[00:14] <newbie_to_ubuntu> i need to know where to go to get help with a gcc problem
[00:15] <_helios_> newbie_to_ubuntu: try #gcc
[00:15] <histo> TheFizzMeister: lspci  or lsusb will show you

[00:17] <TheFizzMeister> I did try a few things Google suggested, but they didn't seem to help.
[00:17] <newbie_to_ubuntu> not much activity in that room
[00:18] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: So, what did google suggest?
[00:18] <histo> TheFizzMeister: it's a ralink chipset
[00:18] <_helios_> TheFizzMeister: you have a different one than I had, mine was WUSB54GSC v2 and it sucked never got it working.
[00:18] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: What does ifconfig say about it?
[00:18] <histo> Savage_CL: Also you can place .desktop files in ~/.config/autostart/
[00:18] <TheFizzMeister> usr13: Didn't say a whole let, hence me coming here.
[00:19] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: Sorry, what does iwconfig say about it.  (typo)
[00:19] <TheFizzMeister> usr13: Just a few minor things, like changing some config stuff.
[00:19] <_helios_> newbie_to_ubuntu: you can try to ask your question here in detail and if someone know's the answer to the problem you are having I'm sure they will help
[00:19] <TheFizzMeister> usr13: What specifically from iwconfig do you need?
=== kiwi_17271 is now known as notprawn
[00:19] <histo> TheFizzMeister: Have you tried connecting to an open network? For instance create one with your smartphone if you have one and then try to connect to that.
[00:19] <TheFizzMeister> eth0 and lo say 'no wireless extensions'.
[00:20] <TheFizzMeister> histo: Yes, I did. Changed my router to open temporarily and it didn't work either.
[00:20] <histo> TheFizzMeister: No a different network
[00:20] <newbie_to_ubuntu> basically, the way ld and linking works changed between Ubuntu 10 and 12.  The linker used to allow indirect references.  Say an executable needs lib A and lib A references lib B.  Old behavior is you just had to link lib A.  Now, in Ubuntu 12.04 you need to link lib A and lib B explicitly.
[00:21] <histo> TheFizzMeister: not one on your router
[00:21] <_helios_> TheFizzMeister: My advice to you from the luck I've had trying to use ndiswrapper is to just purchase a wifi adapter that is compatible with Linux.
[00:21] <newbie_to_ubuntu> I'm looking for a way to find-out how to get the "old linker" behavior back
[00:21] <TheFizzMeister> histo: Ah. I don't have the means to do that unfortunately.
[00:22] <Savage_CL> Alright, so I have a cli php script that I run at login, but it requires user input. how can  I open xterm or something similar and have it close when the script finishes?
[00:22] <histo> _helios_: his card should work in linux
[00:22] <TheFizzMeister> _helios_: I had a feeling that could be the answer. I'm pretty broke right now, so I'll have to find a stop-gap solution in the meantime.

[00:22] <histo> TheFizzMeister: you card should be working. I recomend connecting via iwconfig to see any relevant errors.

[00:23] <k1l> newbie_to_ubuntu: old linker?
[00:23] <TheFizzMeister> eth0 and lo say 'no wireless extensions'. wlan0 has some more information.
[00:23] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: ndiswrapper works but I'm just not convinced that particular device needs it.
[00:23] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: So what does it say about wlan0?
[00:24] <Savage_CL> Anybody?
[00:24] <TheFizzMeister> I'm on my laptop as I write this, so let me write it out.
[00:24] <nikolam> anyone has an idea, how to burn (x)ubuntu live .ISO file to USB drive, to install. Platform is Solaris, where I downloaded .ISO file :)
[00:24] <TheFizzMeister> 'IEEE 802.11bg ESSID:off/any'
[00:24] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: Is there a switch?
[00:24] <TheFizzMeister> 'Mode:MAnaged Access Point: Not-Associated TX-Power=20 dBm'
[00:24] <TheFizzMeister> A switch on what? The card?
[00:24] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: It's a laptop, right?  Is there a toggle switch somewhere on the laptop that toggles the WiFi on/off?
[00:25] <TheFizzMeister> nou, the problem is on my desktop.
[00:25] <histo> TheFizzMeister: rfkill will tell you if it's off

[00:25] <TheFizzMeister> I'm just on my laptop right now because it will connect to the internet.
[00:26] <zykotick9> nikolam: as root, cat the iso to the root of the usb device (ie. no partition specified)
[00:26] <newbie_to_ubuntu> k1l old linker would be the linker in Ubuntu 10.X
[00:26] <TheFizzMeister> rfkill list gives me: "1: phy1: Wireless LAN Soft blocked: no Hard blocked: no"
[00:27] <usr13> TheFizzMeister: If you see wlan0 in the output of iwconfig, that pretty much means the WiFi device is working.
[00:27] <TheFizzMeister> Hrm.
[00:27] <usr13> TheFizzMeister> 'IEEE 802.11bg ESSID:off/any'  means it's turned off.
[00:28] <nikolam> will try it, zykotick9 ;)
[00:28] <TheFizzMeister> I had disabled it for the time being when I did iwconfig the first time.
[00:29] <TheFizzMeister> I have it trying to connect again, and this is the information

[01:18] <ubottu> kazoo: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[01:18] <m__> could nobody help me to find my hdd ?
[01:18] <usr13> kazoo: Yes
[01:18] <k1l> besides the ability to run openbox on its own
[01:19] <NullDev> <m__> in what way one thats not mounted?
[01:19] <sazzert> I like openbox on it's own more than with lxde. Just put xfce4-panel and synapse and you are good :)
[01:19] <usr13> kazoo: sudo apt-get install openbox
[01:19] <m__> NullDev: could u explain to me what u mean ?
[01:20] <NullDev> kazoo if you like old skool Gnome try Mate if you havent already
[01:20] <m__> its just a usal external hdd case
[01:20] <pztrick> m__: does lsblk show it?
[01:20] <kazoo> Mate never heard of it
[01:20] <sazzert> Linux Mint with Mate would probably be better than installing it through ubuntu
[01:20] <NullDev> <m__> you want to find your HD you dont mean where you lost it ?
[01:20] <Tex_Nick> !best | jacksmithz
[01:20] <ubottu> jacksmithz: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[01:21] <usr13> kazoo: Are you 12.04?  If so, see:  http://www.unixmen.com/install-mate-1-4-in-ubuntu-12-04-linuxmint13-and-debian/
[01:21] <kazoo> Hm last time I tried LinuxMint it was buggy as hell
[01:21] <jacksmithz> i dindt ask for the best
[01:21] <kazoo> but that was when it first came out
[01:21] <wjtaylor_> any way to stop the screen from locking out while watching you tube?
[01:21] <Tex_Nick> jacksmithz:  have a look at ... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCards
[01:21] <jacksmithz> thanks
[01:21] <usr13> kazoo: I recommend sticking with ubuntu.  (I use xubuntu)
[01:21] <NullDev> kazoo Mate is a fork of Gnome 2
[01:21] <m__> NullDev: jeah, thats ritgh i try to connet it via usb
[01:21] <k1l> well, mint or mate are not supported here. that goes into the mint support please.
[01:22] <m__> but doesnt find it
[01:22] <k1l> kazoo: what about the gnome-fallback solution or the lxde/xfce for ubuntu?
[01:22] <esph> Anybody know how big I can reasonably expect /var to get on a domestic laptop?
[01:22] <wjtaylor_> kazoo: just install gnome-shell and use gnome classic.   I'm using it now and it's good.
[01:22] <m__> its connected vias usb and i need a way to find how dies it is connected
[01:22] <NullDev> <m__> it should auto mount on plugin but sudo fdisk -l will show you all devices that are connected
[01:23] <kazoo> I'll try out mate first
[01:23] <NullDev> wjtaylor Ive heard good stuff about the gnome classic on gnome 3 you got any screen shots?
[01:24] <wjtaylor_> NullDev: no, It looks like gnome 2
[01:24] <usr13> esph: Maybe 400M or so
[01:24] <NullDev> wjtaylor sounds good!
[01:24] <m__> NullDev: its not connected / he cant fin it
[01:25] <esph> usr13: really? On arch mine get to be about 10GB sometimes.
[01:25] <wjtaylor_> BTW: if you want the xchat to minimize to the panel in gnome in 12.04 you have to add a "Notification Area" to the panel and then it's good.
[01:25] <NullDev> <m__> what , that isnt fdisk output?
[01:25] <m__> there is for my usal internal hdd
[01:25] <usr13> esph: Example:   341M /var
[01:25] <wjtaylor_> NullDev: I have unity installed because it's got a touch screen and I MAY use it... but for real work gnome is good.
[01:26] <NullDev> <m__> sudo fdisk -l | grep /dev
[01:26] <k1l> kazoo: i wouldnt go with a desktop that relies on an old codebase. same for the kde3 fork trinity. that future is limited.
[01:27] <NullDev> wjtaylor personally I hate how our desktops are being tailored for computer illiterates
[01:27] <sankey> i have a box running 12.04 (stock kernel 3.2), and it uses a wifi kernel module currently only included in the 3.6 kernel.
[01:27] <sankey> is there a chance that ubutnu 12.04 will ever include this wifi module in the stock kernel before the release of ubuntu 14.04?
[01:27] <sankey> in particular, this is my situation: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1049466

[01:27] <wjtaylor_> kazoo: stay close to the source... to many bastardized versions out there.... just leads to problems.
[01:28] <wjtaylor_> NullDev:   If I wanted a tablet, I'd just go get an ipad.
[01:28] <m__> NullDev iam not sure if it will show more
[01:28] <esph> usr13: Any idea why Ubuntu's /var would be so much smaller than Arch's?
[01:28] <NullDev> <m__> what?
[01:28] <usr13> esph: Nope
[01:28] <esph> I mean I expected they would be different, but that's very different

[01:29] <usr13> esph: I have a Desktop system that has 548M
[01:30] <NullDev> <m__> the disk isnt being detected for some reason is it dead? Try re-plugging
[01:30] <wjtaylor_> Anyone know how to stop the screen from locking when youtube, etc is playing???
[01:31] <NullDev> wjtaylor yeah turn your screen saver off ;)
[01:31] <m__> NullDev jeah thats my problem i tryed to reconnect, switch the jumper tryed an other  hdd
[01:31] <NullDev> <m__> sata/scsi or ide?

[01:32] <esph> usr13: could be...
[01:32] <wjtaylor_> I think I just found a solution... caffeine
[01:32] <esph> I think I'll go ask in #archlinux and see if they know
[01:33] <NullDev> <m__> you using lvm or software raid?
[01:33] <m__> nothink
[01:33] <esph> make sure it isn't just my user habits
[01:33] <m__> its just an usall usb case
[01:33] <NullDev> <m__> and the drives working?
[01:33] <m__> as far as i know there no driver needed
[01:34] <m__> i even doesnt know the producer of ther case
[01:34] <NullDev> <m__> not sure then tbh might need drive manufacturer, firmware etc to fix this.
[01:35] <NullDev> <m__> might be a bug doesent sound normal
[01:36] <NullDev> <m__> or the drives dead you got any other devices you can attach it to?
[01:36] <m__> i think it could be broken thats i wanna listen if there are any tiny bits on the usb port nonnectot to

[01:44] <xibalba> oh
[01:44] <xibalba> i dont have enough CPU for the RMA
[01:44] <xibalba> RAM*
[01:44] <kimsia> hi there
[01:44] <NullDev> <m__> Looks like you broke the caddy then, do you have any others (not manufactured to inseret the disk to?
[01:44] <histo> xibalba: if you continue reading about the mtrr stuff seems to have fixed his issue.
[01:44] <kimsia> i have an issue with installing a php_perl module in ubuntu server 12.10. I got this error make: *** [php_perl.lo] Error 1 ERROR: `make' failed
[01:45] <xibalba> i only had 4 CPU assigned to this box
[01:45] <m__> I though the old hdd that where inside wherer broken thats why i open the case and inserted a new one
[01:45] <histo> xibalba: What kind of server is this running on that you assigned 128G of ram?
[01:45] <m__> so yes i already have an other hdd
[01:45] <xibalba> big ass vmware server with 192+ GB of RMA
[01:45] <histo> xibalba: is there a reason you are assigning 128g to ubuntu?
[01:46] <xibalba> histo, testing
[01:46] <xibalba> for a client who will need it
[01:46] <NullDev> kimsia most likely the dependencies on the repo dont cater for the source. Need more than that error message though usually the last 8 lines of a compile give enough
[01:46] <histo> xibalba: What is a client going to do with it?
[01:46] <escott> xibalba, so those are related to programming the MTRR
[01:46] <histo> xibalba: Im just curious
[01:47] <kimsia> NullDev: http://askubuntu.com/questions/245996/unable-to-install-pecl-extension-for-perl-in-ubuntu-server-12-10 near the bottom of my question i have the entire error message
=== root__ is now known as pseudor00t
[01:47] <histo> xibalba: also curious on specs of the server do you have the model/manuafacturer?
[01:48] <NullDev> kimsia Im not familiar with pecl thought you meant ./configure
[01:48] <wjtaylor_> Does anyone have the google talk ppa in their repos?
[01:49] <kimsia> NullDev: i am also not familiar with ./configure too. Where can i run ./configure?
[01:49] <NullDev> kimsia you dont need to your (well I thik) compiling from c
[01:50] <NullDev> not*
[01:50] <kimsia> NullDev: In that case, what should be my next step?
[01:51] <NullDev> kimsia Like I said Im not familiar with pecl so not sure
[01:52] <NullDev> kimsia your running Ubuntu server?

[01:57] <kimsia> NullDev: i am sorry what is that command?
[01:58] <Tex_Nick> \\Mr_C\\ :  CTRL+ALT+T
[01:58] <NullDev> kimsia Is this a headless server, how you logged in GUI or SSH?
[01:59] <kimsia> NullDev: it is headless and i logged in via SSH
[01:59] <histo> Num83rGuy: can you describe "trouble"
[01:59] <histo> !details | Num83rGuy
[01:59] <ubottu> Num83rGuy: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[02:00] <NullDev> kimsia ok type everything in the quotes without the quotes "aptitude search pecl"
[02:00] <kimsia> NullDev: I got a list of results
[02:00] <kimsia> NullDev: how to display?
[02:00] <NullDev> kimsia long?
[02:01] <kimsia> NullDev: very long
[02:01] <Num83rGuy> Kubuntu 12.10.  A folder that I made long ago in my home folder that contains some files is now 0 length and unaccessible when before it was.
[02:01] <NullDev> kimsia we probably want to grep it some , you got alot of lib*-pecl?
[02:02] <histo> Num83rGuy: open a termianl and run ls -l | pastebinit
[02:02] <kimsia> NullDev: you mean lib*-perl?
[02:02] <Num83rGuy> All file managers and command line cannot access not even root
[02:02] <kimsia> NullDev: not lib*-pecl
[02:02] <NullDev> kimsia any lib- basically
[02:02] <kimsia> NullDev: plenty of lib-
[02:02] <Tex_Nick> Num83rGuy :  have you tried to copy the files to a new directory ?
[02:02] <kimsia> NullDev: and plenty of lib*-perl
[02:03] <kimsia> NullDev: Don't see any lib*-pecl
[02:03] <NullDev> kimsia ok "aptitude search pecl | grep -v lib-" should narrow it down abit
[02:03] <histo> Num83rGuy: what are the permisions for the directory and attributes  you can find out with ls -l   /path/to/directory
[02:03] <Num83rGuy> histo: will do hold on need to install pastbinit  Tex_Nick: they are unaccessible

[02:07] <histo> Num83rGuy: is the Icons folder the one that has issues?
[02:07] <kunji> NullDev: aptitude isn't really recommended right now, I know it's not related to the command you told him to run, but I think we should be encouraging use of apt-get instead because of some issues with aptitude and a lack of multi-arch support, something like that.
[02:07] <fbdystang> Hey all, ubuntu not finding my internet connection out. But it works coming in. I am behind a router with ethernet. Please advise. Thanks!
[02:08] <NullDev> kimsia pastebin the last 50 lines off /var/log/messages maybe but you could try the ubuntu server channel think its ubuntu-server
[02:08] <histo> Num83rGuy: ls -l /home/paul/Pictures   and paste the Icons line in here
[02:08] <Num83rGuy> histo: Yes it has some icons I made for various things
[02:08] <histo> Num83rGuy: if it's l9onger than 4 lines pastebinit
[02:08] <kimsia> NullDev: thank you. I would go to ubuntu-server then
[02:08] <Num83rGuy> histo: OK
[02:09] <NullDev> kimsia good luck
[02:09] <kunji> kimsia: installing pecl is a bitch, you'll need to spend some hours on google looking for the magic code words, I would tell you, but I don't remember them T.T

[02:10] <histo> Num83rGuy: chmod a+x /home/paul/Pictures/Icons
[02:11] <histo> Num83rGuy: you changed the permissions of the directory at some point. It is no longer executible that is your problem. That chmod command will make the Icons directory executible again by all
[02:11] <Num83rGuy> histo: Great that worked! Now tell me what that did.
[02:11] <kimsia> kunji: I am frustrated. i now have 4 irc channels opened. so far, no closer to an answer
[02:12] <histo> Num83rGuy: Directories need to be executible to enter them

[02:13] <histo> NullDev: his initial issue was install php-perl

[02:20] <kunji> histo: I think that might be PECL that builds from source, isn't it?  I think he is trying to do it the way PECL describes.

=== MartinS is now known as Guest34395
[02:21] <ClientAlive> I'm having trouble finding instructions to delete an old set of ssh keys on an ubuntu system using open ssh. Can someone help me?
[02:21] <NullDev> kimsia if your compiling add an unprivilaged user and do it under that user!
[02:21] <saloomi2012> how to keep both ubuntu and windows on a desktop?
[02:21] <kimsia> NullDev: i don't understand what you mean by that?
[02:22] <ClientAlive> I see instruction to create new keys but not clear instruction on deleting old keys.
[02:22] <histo> ClientAlive: On the ssh server or the client?
[02:22] <kunji> histo: right, but the versions of those in the repos may be too old, etc... I remember having to do this runaround at an internship I had, I had to duplicate their current working environment so I had to get exact versions of many php modules that were newer than those in the repos, so I had to get pear and pecl and update their repos somehow and then they would finally install, but like I was saying, it required some magic.
[02:23] <histo> kimsia: you are trying to install software from source and then coming into a ubuntu chat room for support.
[02:23] <NullDev> kimsia if your compiling from source it should all go in usr/local so it shouldnt matter
[02:24] <ClientAlive> Well I have two computers to connect on my local netwrok (a desktop and a laptop). Both my old lappy and the desktop were all set up to connect either direction but now this new lappy is not. I want to have both ssh server and client on both machines, delete the old keys on the desktop, then start fresh.
=== Wug is now known as Wug[Hyperspace]
[02:24] <ClientAlive> I can handle making new kesys on my own but don't know how to remove the old keys from the desktop
[02:24] <histo> ClientAlive: well the client keys are in
[02:24] <ClientAlive> I'm looking for a fresh start
[02:24] <histo> ClientAlive: ~/.ssh
[02:25] <ClientAlive> ok
[02:25] <sudarshan> hellow..
[02:25] <ClientAlive> aret there two sets? A set for server and a set for client?
[02:25] <histo> ClientAlive: the server keys are in /etc/ssh
[02:25] <sudarshan> क्या बात है.
[02:25] <ClientAlive> ok
[02:25] <kimsia> NullDev: I think i am getting somewhere... i managed to compile the perl.so successfully
[02:25] <ClientAlive> so I merely rm them?
[02:25] <kimsia> NullDev: you and the #perl people gave me some clues. Thank you.
[02:26] <histo> ClientAlive: You can althought I don't understand why you are.
[02:26] <histo> ClientAlive: You most likely just want to copy your new keys to authorized keys
[02:26] <nuf0xx> ClientAlive: the old keys are in ~/.ssh for the client and /etc/ssh for the server
[02:26] <NullDev> clientalive not the best but > .ssh/known_hosts . Ideally nano +line that ssh warns you about (think its near the bottom somewhere) and delete thatg line
[02:27] <ClientAlive> histo: bc this will be my second time doing somthething like this. I have learned better ways to config the stuff since tha first time plus I want the exper of doing it a second time
[02:27] <ClientAlive> appreciate you help so very much histo
[02:27] <ClientAlive> thx
[02:27] <SnapSnap> Hi. I'm having trouble with the backup utility.
[02:27] <histo> ClientAlive: The better way of learning would be removing the old keys from the authorized_keys file  in the ~/.ssh   and then placing the new ones in htere
[02:27] <NullDev> clivealive if your on an untrusted network never nuke your known_hosts
[02:27] <nuf0xx> if you edit the file and delete the lines it will ask you to accept (yes|no) the next time you connect
[02:28] <histo> ClientAlive: That's all you really have to do I would stay out of /etc/ssh
[02:28] <ClientAlive> ok
[02:28] <ClientAlive> so it's just the stuff in authorized_keys I need to be concerned with?
[02:28] <NullDev> histo why lol
[02:28] <histo> NullDev: that's his issue
[02:29] <NullDev> histo I meant about /etc/ssh
[02:29] <histo> NullDev: Becuase if he deletes the host keys he needs to reconfigure ssh server
[02:29] <NullDev> If your running a Linux server thats the first /etc/sswh/sshd_config
[02:30] <NullDev> histo I think you mean .ssh/ ?
[02:30] <histo> ClientAlive: the host keys in /etc/ssh are generated upon openssh server being installed.  So if you delete those you need to sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
[02:30] <SnapSnap> Can anyone help me with the backup utility?
[02:30] <histo> NullDev: No He asked about deleting the server and client keys
[02:30] <histo> !details | SnapSnap
[02:30] <ubottu> SnapSnap: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[02:31] <NullDev> histo yeah the host key is regenerated but. You cant trust the host key auuth no you need to really "trust" the server
[02:31] <histo> ClientAlive: Also I would recomend transfering the client keys to the host via ssh-copy-id command
[02:31] <histo> NullDev: Yes the fingerprint
[02:32] <histo> ClientAlive: also clear out your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. That will ahve the old fingerprint from the server
[02:32] <NullDev> histo from what I know dsa/rsa doesent do that?
[02:32] <Tex_Nick> !backup | SnapSnap
[02:32] <SnapSnap> histo, I get an error when I try to perform a backup. I'm running Ubuntu version 12.10. When I try to perform a backup, I get this error: "Backup Failed. BackendException: Could not initialize backend: No module named couch.auth"

[02:32] <histo> NullDev: I know as well. He just asked I epxlained why he shouldn't be really concerned with /etc/ssh
[02:33] <NullDev> histo ok lol
[02:33] <ClientAlive> histo: sounds good. I also have a thumd drive here. Perhaps I'll use sneakernet to do the transfer  :)
[02:34] <NullDev> histo And thats why I told him to modify the keys line only (Is better than nuking it , I do that alot)
[02:34] <aimalk510> hi

[02:36] <kimsia> http://pastebin.com/Z32Xy2jr
[02:36] <felix_> compiz doesn't work =(
[02:36] <RollinV2> the point of ssh key is so password login can be disabled
[02:36] <aimalk510> im trying to figure out the john the ripper
[02:36] <kimsia> i tried sudo locale-gen en_SG.UTF-8 en_SG and sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

[02:39] <lolhii> New to unix, what's ubuntu server for? I don't code on it right?
[02:39] <lolhii> It's for setting up a lampstack?
[02:39] <ClientAlive> histo: I thnk I made a mistake man. I knew that ubuntu 12.04 will automatically generate some files if they are missing - so I deleted the files in ~/.ssh (thinking they be regeneratied with the defaults). They didn't. What can I do?
[02:39] <histo> RollinV2: For instance i've used it so cronjobs have access without being prompted for passwd. But I can still leave password authentication enabled.
[02:40] <NullDev> one thing against doing things in bash scripts , you actually forget how to do it
[02:40] <escott> ClientAlive, nothing will ever touch the contents of $HOME. but its just an identity. you can create a new one with ssh-keygen
[02:40] <histo> ClientAlive: Now regenerate your keys and go forward
[02:41] <ClientAlive> thank you fellas
[02:41] <histo> ClientAlive: your known_hosts will be regenerated upon connecting to an ssh server
[02:41] <histo> ClientAlive: You'll be prompted about the fingerprint ofcourse
[02:41] <ClientAlive> so the exact command "ssh-keygen" <enter>  then proceed with creating the new ones?
[02:42] <NullDev> lol I was confused by the fingerprint. I always see that as a warning screen (I never read them do you?)
[02:43] <aimalk510> does anyone run backtrack here?
[02:43] <histo> ClientAlive: I would use rsa keys ssh-keygen -t rsa     enter
[02:43] <histo> ClientAlive: hold up I made a youtube video doing all this I'll get you a link
[02:43] <k1l> !backtrack | aimalk510
[02:43] <Tex_Nick> !backtrack | aimalk510

[02:44] <ClientAlive> histo: ahh great. I''m also seeing how it works in the web page i'm looking at. I just hadn't read all the way through it before asking hot to remove keys.
[02:44] <k1l> lolhii: server version comes without a preinstalled desktop
[02:44] <ClientAlive> got it
[02:44] <ClientAlive> thank you
[02:44] <lolhii> k1l, if im supposed to be good in unix for a job, should i be using desktop?
[02:44] <RollinV2> histo, thats an interesting way to evade a password requirement
[02:45] <NullDev> lolhii now its all servers/super computers
[02:45] <histo> RollinV2: well I was using rsync ina  cronjob for off site backup and didn't want ot mess with it any other way
[02:45] <k1l> lolhii: depends on which skills you need for that job.
[02:45] <bel3atar> how do I install ubuntu?
[02:45] <NullDev> no*

[02:46] <NullDev> Ive hear alot about Ngnix never used it and I love Apache
[02:46] <k1l> lolhii: that sounds like servers stuff. but that can be installed on a desktop, too
[02:46] <RollinV2> bel3atar, figure out if you want to dual boot, run ubuntu in a virtual machine, use wabi (oh noes), or use ubuntu as primary and only OS

[02:46] <histo> RollinV2: only way I can think of doing that is with keys
[02:47] <lolhii> k1l, i dont know any of those terms :|
[02:47] <bel3atar> RollinV2: can I install it on a USB stick?
[02:47] <NullDev> lolhii !!
[02:47] <histo> bel3atar: yes
[02:47] <RollinV2> histo, you can include the password in a script
[02:47] <NullDev> didnt think irc would be as good as bash ;)
[02:47] <bel3atar> histo: and it will run everywhere?
[02:47] <histo> RollinV2: I think keys are more secure
[02:47] <RollinV2> but thats a security issue in and of itself
[02:47] <RollinV2> histo, ya
[02:47] <histo> bel3atar: yes
[02:48] <ClientAlive> histo: wow that's great. You have a deep voice btw  :)
[02:48] <RollinV2> bel3atar, ya if you install ubuntu on a usb stick the usb acts as both a live install and as the installer
[02:49] <bel3atar> RollinV2: but there is a risk it would erase itself
[02:49] <histo> ClientAlive: np glad it helped
[02:49] <kimsia> NullDev: histo got it to work
[02:49] <NullDev> Dongt want to disrupt the channel but most if not all mainseam distros do that now
[02:50] <k1l> bel3atar: what should erase itself?
[02:50] <RollinV2> bel3atar, im not experienced enough with running ubuntu from usb to attest to data preservation if you use that method
[02:50] <kimsia> the trick was to set LC_ALL inside /etc/envirionment and reboot
[02:50] <kimsia> everything else such as locale-gen failed
[02:50] <bel3atar> k1l: installing from and to the same usb
[02:50] <kimsia> thank you, NullDev and histo
[02:50] <NullDev> kimsia nice what was it?
[02:50] <kimsia> i have to go now. bye!~~~
[02:50] <NullDev> kimsia night
[02:51] <kimsia> NullDev: well, basically  i have to set LC_ALL ="en_SG.UTF-8" inside /etc/environment
[02:51] <kimsia> and reboot
[02:51] <kimsia> everything else failed
[02:51] <k1l> bel3atar: wel, yes. that is not gonna work that way. either you need to install it on it or (the better version) you make a so called persistent usb stick
[02:51] <aldo_raine> hi guys
[02:51] <kimsia> i am going to pay it forward by writing out a long answer in askubuntu
[02:51] <kimsia> hopefully other people will benefit from this

[02:53] <Tex_Nick> aldo_raine :  hello ... if you have an ubuntu related question ... please ask :-)
[02:53] <NullDev> kimsia you didnt have to reboot just needed to 'set you enviroment variables, where your home directory is basically) restarting gnome or just typing bash if via ssh
[02:54] <aldo_raine> Tex_Nick: thanks a lot, but i asked in #ubuntu-server :)
[02:55] <NullDev> Linux only EVER needs rebooting to loadf the new kernel (although, Ive heard of a non rebootable kernel in the works)
[02:56] <acovrig> I switched from an ati card to an nvidia card, and now I get GLX is not available on the system, how do I fix this?
[02:56] <source> if anyone is familiar with goverment/police forensics i would appreciate a pm

[02:57] <RollinV2> 2013 = the year of everyone locking down their computers and finally giving a crap about data security
[02:57] <source> well i have a situation that happened recently and i had some questions on procedure. its quite the story
[02:58] <NullDev> source you want to try the more advanced Linux channels lol
[02:58] <source> thats a bright idea also
[02:58] <RollinV2> ya go ask in archlinux.. if they dont flame you they will give you an ear full

[03:04] <RollinV2> NullDev, i use CentOS in production. nearly 3+ years exp. but i mainly need to grasp the differences that redhat brings to the table
[03:04] <RollinV2> NullDev, i think i could pass it now. but at $400 per test. i dont want to screw up.
[03:05] <NullDev> Rollinv2 nothing all CentOS do is strip the Red Hat out . Theres sometimes bugs where CentOS havent caught up with RH
[03:06] <NullDev> Rollinv2 If youve spent that long working with it as long as you can set up a LAMP server your sorted
[03:07] <RollinV2> NullDev, thanks. means a lot to hear an encouraging word.
[03:08] <RollinV2> first time i setup a server it toke 2 weeks. i can do it now (assuming scripts dont halt) in about 15min.
[03:08] <ClientAlive> one last thing. I used to have it set up so I could time the host name I see on my command line (ie: ssh mycomputername). I can't recall how I made ssh recognize that rather than a numerical ip address.

[03:12] <NullDev> it will be ,ssh/known_hosts
[03:12] <NullDev> . not ,
[03:13] <RollinV2> he wants to see the host name not the ip on the command line in the prompt
[03:13] <RollinV2> that suggests that he was using a custom .bashrc with the command line edited

[03:30] <hilo> spydon, consider setting up your own at an unrestricted location and having it at the ready. I use openvpn for similar purposes.
[03:31] <NullDev> nice tip hilo

[03:31] <intr0x80> How do I know if my installation is grub1 or grub2?
[03:32] <mummyboo> hi
[03:32] <cfhowlett> intr0x80, grub 2 has been default for quite awhile, so if it's a recent ubuntu version ...
[03:32] <NullDev> giganews if anyone are useneters give vpn with one of there think gold accounts
[03:32] <intr0x80> NullDev: okay Ubuntu 12.04 Server is grub2?
[03:32] <intr0x80> it says grub-1.99
[03:32] <josesierra> Okay, so I was on earlier, asking if my gnome-shell process at 120-190MB was more or less normal.  Now, hours later I come back to my computer and check the process, and it's at 301mb.  That smells an awful lot like a memory leak somewhere.  Thoughts?  Or is this really normal memory behavior for Ubuntu w/ Gnome Shell?
[03:32] <intr0x80> Not really sure what that mans. :)

[04:01] <silenceissad> Good evening, gents.  I had a quick question concerning ubuntu, and linux in general: Whenever there's an update to the distro (happens every six months, as I read), can the user perform a live update to the newest version from their current linux distro, or do they have to update as they would a windows OS?
[04:01] <Wug> silenceissad: live update.  though some users will tell you that several consecutive updates can cause weirdly broken things
[04:01] <histo> silenceissad: yes and no
[04:02] <Wug> me being one of them
[04:02] <cfhowlett> silenceissad, you can live update every 6 months in ubuntu.
[04:02] <Wug> but you can initiate the upgrade yourself with the command "apt-get dist-upgrade" (must be run as root)
[04:02] <histo> silenceissad: You will be prompted when a new release is availible. You can then select upgrade at that time.  In between you will receive updates and security fixes.
[04:02] <NullDev> <silenceissad> depends on your distro really
[04:03] <cfhowlett> silenceissad, for peace of mind, one COULD choose to just install the LTS release and upgrade every 2 years to the next LTS release.
[04:03] <histo> silenceissad: I would recomend running LTS version
[04:03] <NullDev> anyone here done LFS?
[04:03] <histo> silenceissad: and staying with it untill the next LTS
[04:03] <histo> NullDev: I have
[04:04] <cfhowlett> Wug, dist-upgrade will update that release not upgrade to the next release
[04:04] <NullDev> histo how far,and what did you gain?
[04:04] <Wug> well disregard me then, im doing it wrong
[04:04] <cfhowlett> Wug, not if things still work :)
[04:06] <Tex_Nick> silenceissad :  you can control that stuff in... System Settings/Software Sources/Updates :-)
[04:06] <histo> NullDev: I had a working system, I don't remember if I built X or not.  I gained knowledge on how things all worked together. I didn't have much understanding at first going through the book but It all came together in the end. I feel you could gain almost as much knowledge setting up an Arch system.  Other than compiling things from source etc...
[04:07] <histo> NullDev: Like you have to build the tools just to build the build tools.  It's kind of confusinig in the begining if you are not familiar with building packages.
[04:07] <silenceissad> thank you all for the prompt and very well explained setup.  I've played with ubuntu a couple of times in the past, but never long enough to be prompted for the update.  This puts me at ease, knowing that the LTE can be live updated, as it lowers the risk of me botching an upgrade when I only have one system to work with.
[04:08] <histo> silenceissad: yes you can go LTS to LTS
[04:08] <histo> silenceissad: if you go to an in between update like lets say 12.10 and then 14.04 comes out.  You'd have to 12.10 > 13.04 > 13.10 > 14.04
[04:09] <Rarrikins> Why does `apt-get uninstall mysql-server; apt-get install mysql-server` not install all the files and ask me to set the database password?
[04:09] <histo> silenceissad: that's where people have issues. But 12.04 to 14.04 will be supported
[04:09] <NullDev> histo personally I learned quite a bit from LFs until pass 3 on gcc (I was building on a virtualbox Wether thats me being wet from the ears then Im not sure, but I could never get the results to compare with mine)
[04:09] <cfhowlett> silenceissad, in my experience, while live update is nice, clean install is better and actually leads to few headaches.  Just sayin' ...
[04:09] <cfhowlett> *fewer headaches*
[04:09] <rats_> silenceissad: the 12.94 release is good for 5 yrs
[04:10] <histo> Rarrikins: because the old files were not purged
[04:10] <silenceissad> histo: Thank you for pointing that out.  I just wanted to get that straight *before* I move to the BFE with only one pc to work with.
[04:10] <dandaman> NullDev: sorry, was that paste from cd2000 directed at me?
[04:10] <histo> NullDev: typos most likely I had trouble decerning ' vs `  etc... ON their page.
[04:10] <histo> silenceissad: definately go LTS then before you go to BFE
[04:10] <NullDev> dandaman no
[04:11]  * cfhowlett revealing my ignorance: what is BFE?  
[04:11] <RollinV2> reinstalling ubuntu should be easy. automate your setup tasks with a script.
[04:11] <Rarrikins> histo: What is an easy way to purge the old files?
[04:11] <histo> Rarrikins: you'd have to do something like sudo apt-get purge mysql-server && sudo apt-get install mysql-server       Purge will get rid of the configs etc...
[04:11] <dandaman> damn, well can anyone help me install grub on my new hard drive? im completely lost following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#via_ChRoot
[04:11] <Rarrikins> histo: Thanks :)
[04:12] <histo> dandaman: grubinstall /dev/of/harddrive  isnt' it?
[04:12] <NullDev> why not just find / -iname * | xargs rm -rf
[04:12] <dandaman> histo: the issue is i copied one hard drive to a new one, i think that is messing things up
[04:12] <Rarrikins> No, it's still not letting me set anything, and wouldn't you know it, it doesn't install anything to /etc/init.d if it's not there.
[04:12] <histo> dandaman: How did you copy it?  What tool did you use?
[04:13] <dandaman> rsync -av /oldhd /newhd
[04:13] <histo> Rarrikins: Like what do you want to set?  What behavior are you expecting?
[04:13] <histo> dandaman: oh boy
[04:13] <NullDev> dandaman what grub do you need to install legacy or v2? What distr you running thats its being installed to?
[04:13] <dandaman> that's what people were telling me to do earlier because it is an ssd
[04:13] <dandaman> NullDev: using 10.04 LTS
[04:14] <dBLOOD> hi peopple!
[04:14] <cfhowlett> dandaman, end of life in 3 months you know ...
[04:14] <dBLOOD> can anyone help me?
[04:14] <cfhowlett> dBLOOD, greetings
[04:14] <histo> dandaman: do you know what the device number is for the drive?
[04:14] <histo> cfhowlett: nO it's not
[04:14] <cfhowlett> dBLOOD, ask with details please
[04:14] <silenceissad> Lastly, would you recommend installing a backup OS in the event something crashes the current linux build?  I'm not much for blindly ripping into and adjusting code/script, so I don't think it'd be an issue on my part, but I'm not sure just how stable linux is, and if installing something new might corrupt a setting/script that would corrupt the OS.
[04:14] <histo> cfhowlett: LTS is 5 years
[04:14] <Rarrikins> histo: I want apt-get intsall mysql-server to make a mysql file in /etc/init.d
[04:14] <NullDev> dandaman your gonna need someone local or a remote kvm
[04:14] <dandaman> histo: yes, old one is sda1 new one is sdc1
[04:14] <dBLOOD> can I make my ex4 /home without reinstalling my sys?
[04:14] <histo> Rarrikins: You do realize we are using upstart now right?
[04:14] <cfhowlett> histo, 10.04 desktop has 36 months support, network has 60 months
[04:15] <histo> dandaman: grubinstall /dev/sda1
[04:15] <NullDev> dandaman grub-install /dev/
[04:15] <histo> dandaman: grubinstall /dev/sda
[04:15] <histo> dandaman: stop
[04:15] <dandaman> ?
[04:15] <histo> dandaman: grubinstall /dev/sdc
[04:15] <Tex_Nick> silenceissad :  something to keep inmind though ... clean installs of major releases are sometimes preferable to upgrades ... when you install ubuntu the first time, segregating home onto another partition facilitates that
[04:15] <histo> sorry typo'd the first couple
[04:15] <cfhowlett> histo, LTS is 5 years for desktop and server as of 12.04 ...
[04:15] <NullDev> best to install to the MBR than a partition
[04:15] <dandaman> histo: just do that from a liveboot terminal?
[04:15] <histo> dandaman: grubinstall /dev/sdc   will install grub to the MBR of the new drive

[04:43] <zykotick9> cocomo: honestly i think rsync is the best solution for virtually all sync needs.  but look into unison for something a big for conventional.
[04:43] <cfhowlett> codepython777, oh, you mean for the latest ubuntu version ... I'd say contact the package maintainers
[04:43] <codepython777> cfhowlett: I was looking for someone who uses pdns
[04:43] <jinx3d> Hi, I am new to the linux community, I have 7 computer systems out of which I intent to use ones as a server and the rest as clients. What I wanted to do was whenever I get any package or updates on a client I want them to get it from the server and I want the server to keep only one copy of it instead of getting it 6 times from the internet.
[04:43] <Altimeter> cocomo, I'll second rsync.  It's phenomenal.
[04:43] <zykotick9> cocomo: s/big for/bit more/
[04:44] <jarray52> I
[04:44] <cfhowlett> jinx3d, you can set one of your boxes as a private mirror and direct the boxes to that machine
[04:44] <cocomo> ty guys i'll look into lsyncd n rsync
[04:44] <cocomo> is there a way to sync mysql databases on these two systems also?
[04:45] <RollinV2> cocomo, sqldump -> rsync
[04:45] <jinx3d> cfhowlett, how do I keep the updates and the packages once downloaded there?
[04:45] <zykotick9> jinx3d: check out apt-cacher-ng or apt-cacher
[04:45] <RollinV2> cocomo,  but you should write a good script for that one
[04:45] <dr_willis_> jinx3d:  apt-cacher-ng is a must have for a small lan like that. ;)
[04:46] <jarray52> I'm using a second monitor with my laptop. When I click the display settings, the second monitor will only allow me to use 1024x768 resolution. Is that due to my graphics  card driver?
[04:46] <cocomo> i don't know shell script :()
[04:46] <cocomo> i know javascript :)
[04:46] <jarray52> cocomo: They're very different things.
[04:46] <cfhowlett> jinx3d, there are a few articles and tutorials out there.  Sadly, I'm in China and my internet speed is throttled.  Search ubuntu + private + mirror
[04:46] <jinx3d> I'll check it out. Thanks :-) can't type everyone's name I am on a small phone. :-o
[04:47] <Tex_Nick> dandaman :  i had to scroll up to see what your original issue was ... haven't read read the entire thread but ... if you have replaced the IDE drive with your new SSD ... then use the IDE for a data drive
[04:47] <bravis> wee
[04:47] <cfhowlett> jinx3d, I'd imagine the folks in #ubuntu-server have experience with your scenario
[04:49] <jinx3d> cfhowlett, thanks I'll drop by there after I have checked out. Apt cacher
[04:49] <dandaman> Tex_Nick: yeah that's the obvious solution, but i was wondering if there was anything cool to do with it
[04:49] <cfhowlett> jinx3d, best of luck
[04:50] <jinx3d> cfhowlett, thanks! And now your name is my phone dictionary. ;-)
[04:50] <zykotick9> jinx3d: i would recommend using apt-cacher-ng over apt-cacher.  it supports multiple distros and releases at the same time.  apt-cacher can only do one
[04:51] <jinx3d> zykotick9, thanks I actually have mint on the other boxes. I might use ubuntu server for the server
[04:52] <Tex_Nick> dandaman :  hey i have a demo pc i use to instruct some classes ... i removed the top of a hd to demonstrate the inner workings of if ... that's kinda cool ... don't trust QOS on it though ;-)

I have Win 7 Ultimate installed on 1st HD (240GB SSD), my second HD is a 2 TB WD 7200 RPM drive (1 NTFS partition), my 3rd HD is a Seagate 320 GB HDD with 1 NTFS partition and my 4th HDD is a 320 GB WD HDD with Ubuntu 12.10 64bit installed.

[05:05] <cfhowlett> CD2000, if this thing is boot MBR, then you've absolutely got more than 4 partitions and that will make grub do strange things
[05:06] <CD2000> The most partitions I have on any disk is 3 on the 4th disk which has Ubuntu installed on it.
[05:06] <cfhowlett> CD2000, 4 PRIMARY partitions is the mbr limit.  Logical partitions are limitless (?)
[05:06] <usr13> CD2000: You only need it on one drive, sda  (that is the one you have your PC booting to).
[05:07] <cfhowlett> CD2000, windows will grab 2 partitions; restore and win8 ...

[05:08] <dandaman1> so are there any ways i can take advantage of my ssd with ubuntu?
[05:08] <usr13> CD2000: So what happens when you boot?
[05:09] <CD2000> FYI, I have a screenshot of my drives in Computer Management module from Win7, if you would like to see my disks' layout.
[05:09] <dr_willis_> dandaman1:  i find the speed boost a nice advantage. ;)
[05:09] <CD2000> It just boots to Windows. I try to boot from different disks via the BIOS but it always tells me no OS found
[05:10] <usr13> CD2000: We see the disk layout  --> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1584480/  <--
[05:10] <dr_willis_> Hmm. that almost sounds like grub did not get installed on the other disks
[05:10] <usr13> dr_willis_: It did not get installed on sda (which is the drive he boots to).
[05:10] <CD2000> I even tried the option to install Grub on every disk except the USB but it still won't work... I'm really getting confused.
[05:11] <CD2000> I get that Grub didn't install on sda but I've ran boot repair several times already...
[05:11]  * cfhowlett with multiple hdds would cd2000 NOT have to specify WHICH device to load grub on?  sda01, sda02, etc?
[05:11] <dandaman1> dr_willis_: anything beyond that?
[05:12]  * cfhowlett or is the protocol sda, sdb, sdc ?
[05:12] <CD2000> I first tried sda1, that didn't work. Then I tried others but still no go...
[05:12] <usr13> CD2000: Not sda1  sda
[05:13] <CD2000> yes, sorry.

[05:15] <dr_willis_> grub sould go on sda sdb sdc    not sda1 and sdb2 from what i know ;) but i dont mess with uefi (yet)

[05:27] <dr_willis_> tmpfs is a 'ram disk' there are some speed benifits of having it there.

[05:50] <UbuntuNewb> Hi. I think I have a virus. Everytime I boot up my computer, it looks like all my files are encrypted and I have to run ecryptfs to get them running again. Things have been getting weird in a lot of other aspects, as well: I'm trying to make a USB bootdisk, and it's telling me that it's capacity is 14.9 gigs when I know it is a 16 gig drive. When I first inserted the disk, it said that it was 16, and didn't change until I att
[05:50] <UbuntuNewb> empted to load a new distro on it with unetbootin.
[05:50]  * dr_willis missed the question
[05:51] <dr_willis> i doubt if you have managed to find a virus on linux
[05:51] <UbuntuNewb> I know, I know, but it's really acting crazy.
[05:51] <anthony> well i think google solved my problem thid time
[05:52] <UbuntuNewb> I'm currently trying to make a new Ubuntu USB bootdrive on the oddly acting USB disk anyway. If it continues to act odd, I might just have to get someone to make a boot disk from me on another computer. Is there any other solutions that someone can think of?
[05:53] <Tex_Nick> !virus | UbuntuNewb
[05:53] <ubottu> UbuntuNewb: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[05:53] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick I ran ClamAV linux antivirus and found 53 threats. I deleted them, but it's still acting funky.
[05:54] <UbuntuNewb> Linux virus' are rare but they do exist.
[05:54] <cfhowlett> UbuntuNewb, you found 53 threats?  Not going to ask what you've been looking at but that is a LOT ...
[05:54] <genoobie> my grub is broken
[05:54] <cfhowlett> genoobie, puppylinux is not supported here ...
[05:54] <UbuntuNewb> It happened right after I downloaded a torrent
[05:54] <UbuntuNewb> for BackTrack linux.
[05:55] <matthewvz> Just saying grub is broken won't help us help you.
[05:55] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  out of curosity ... what were the threats reported ?\
[05:56] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick Several files with .PDF extensions, something called AwesomiumProcess, etc etc.
[05:57] <UbuntuNewb> When I went to the destinations that the reported viruses were found at, I couldn't see them even if I set it to show .files
[05:57] <dell> i installed ATI drivers, and now unity doesnt work
[05:58] <UbuntuNewb> I googled Awesomium but it said it wasn't a virus but just something for gaming, so it's possible that it's a false alarm but between that and the fact that several of the files had copied themselves throughout my home folder it has me worried, not to mention the random root access requests.
[05:58] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  those appear to be .exe files ... shouldn't ever infect your linux system
[05:58] <Bon-chan> guys, where can i found the config files of my terminal?
[05:59] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick I thought the same thing, but it looks like they were booting themselves through WINE
[05:59] <UbuntuNewb> They had copied themselves from other folders into my WINE software.
[05:59] <Wug> you wouldn't get a virus from a linux torrent
[05:59] <Wug> at least not an official one.
[05:59] <cfhowlett> ubuntulog, more likely that .exe files are set to boot wine on your system
[06:00] <genoobie> matthewvz are you still here?
[06:00] <cfhowlett> UbuntuNewb, .exe files are set to start wine by default if wine is installed.
[06:00] <Wug> if youve gotten something its probably either something that got into your computer with via a weak password
[06:00] <Ben64> !details | genoobie
[06:00] <ubottu> genoobie: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[06:00] <matthewvz> genoobie: I'm here.
[06:00] <genoobie> okay here's the deal
[06:00] <dr_willis> and worse case... a windows exe malware - would mess up the users files.. not the whole system
[06:00] <genoobie> I have three partitions
[06:00] <Ben64> genoobie: but we cannot help you with puppy linux
[06:00] <dr_willis> unless you ran wine as root. ;)
[06:00] <Wug> killall wine
[06:00] <Ben64> wineserver -k
[06:00] <genoobie> there's /sda1 for winxp
[06:00] <cfhowlett> genoobie, #puppylinux is the channel you want.
[06:01] <cfhowlett> !puppylinux|genoobie
[06:01] <genoobie> there's /sda2 which is swap and sda3 which is for experimental *nix installs
[06:01] <genoobie> for some reason, I've lost my grub
[06:01] <Wug> cfhowlett: dumb things like partitions are common to every linux distro
[06:01] <dr_willis> genoobie:  and what Version of ubuntu are you running?
[06:02] <matthewvz> Boot on a live CD and reinstall GRUB?
[06:02] <red82> I'm trying to turn on ssl for my apache on ubuntu.  I moved default-ssl to sites-enabled.  Do I need to replace _default_:443 with mydomain.com:443 ?
[06:02] <Wug> genoobie: reinstall it with your package manager of choice
[06:02] <genoobie> so I am trying to reinstall, but /sda1 the xp partition is hibernating
[06:02] <genoobie> well I am using a grub installer
[06:02] <UbuntuNewb> Wug I agree, and cfhowlett I see your point as well. It was a torrent downloaded directly from the site (unless I was somehow the victim of fishing). I didn't run WINE as root, or give root permissions to wine files, but the fact that the files copied themselves from one folder into the .wine folder, as well as the random requests for authentication have me worried. Also, why do I need to run ecryptfs on every boot up now?
[06:02] <genoobie> and it is asking where I want the grub files to go
[06:02] <cfhowlett> Wug, correct, but he already said he's running puppylinux ...
[06:02] <dell> genoobie: format everything and reinstall ubuntu and xp
[06:03] <dr_willis> genoobie:  that would be on sda or sdb  depending on your setup
[06:03] <genoobie> so I'm not sure how to respond to this
[06:03] <dell> genoobie: thats what i would do.. in fact i will be doing it in a moment
[06:03] <Wug> cfhowlett: grub behaves the same on all versions
[06:03] <cfhowlett> UbuntuNewb, if you
[06:03] <Wug> it breaks the same way, and you fix it the same way
[06:03] <genoobie> dr_willis, only one dev
[06:03] <genoobie> sda
[06:03] <genoobie> no other hdd
[06:03] <dr_willis> genoobie:  guess you can only give one answer then.
[06:03] <genoobie> so dr_willis, /dev/sda1 for instance?
[06:04] <genoobie> or /dev/sda2?
[06:04] <dr_willis> genoobie:  i said SDA   not sda1
[06:04] <genoobie> oh
[06:04] <genoobie> dr_willis, no /dev?
[06:04] <dell> yeah fool, 1 and 2 are partitions
[06:04] <dr_willis> depends on how its asking.. it may assume /dev/
[06:04] <dell> genoobie: cfdisk /dev/sda
[06:04] <cfhowlett> Wug, noted ...
[06:04] <UbuntuNewb> Also, sometimes when I boot it acts like a fresh install (all items on the Launcher are the same as from original boot, it forgets which items I've given permissions to run as a program, etc) and all my FireFox addons are gone: it looks like I used the Reset FireFox option.
[06:04] <genoobie> okay
[06:05] <M4dN3ss> lol
[06:05] <dell> it is /etc/sda!!!
[06:05] <genoobie> dr_willis, much obliged
[06:05] <dell> maybe /usr/lib/sda
[06:05] <Wug> UbuntuNewb: if you're that concerned about it, format and reinstall
[06:05] <cfhowlett> Wug, but would I go to #redhat for assistance with ubuntu?  same principle ...
[06:05] <Wug> cfhowlett: if he had ubuntu, would you help him fix grub?
[06:05] <dell> cfhowlett: in principle, nobody should help with other distro people... when i do that they dont help me
[06:05] <UbuntuNewb> Wug: Thank you. I'm just still worried about the disappearing room on by USB stick.
[06:06] <Wug> UbuntuNewb: when in doubt format all the things
[06:06] <syazlanj> #kampung
[06:06] <Wug> though it could just be hidden files
[06:06] <dell> i would format
[06:06] <Wug> ctrl+h in the file browser will show hidden foles
[06:06] <UbuntuNewb> Should I worry that whatever this is has somehow transfered itself into the new boot drive? I checked for .files
[06:07] <cfhowlett> UbuntuNewb, a fresh install would overwrite the boot drive ...
[06:07] <dell> i am sure linux viruses are smarter than that.. they would write themselves to /proc somewhere, or something
[06:07] <dell> not as hidden files in your home folder
[06:07] <Wug> proc is a temporary filesystem
[06:07] <Wug> it gets destroyed and recreated fresh when you reboot
[06:07] <UbuntuNewb> Wug: Already tried that, nothing was there. I formatted it again and it still says my max data is 14.9 rather then the 16 it said originally. Is there another way to check for something hidden, like a hidden partition on the USB?
[06:08] <dell> UbuntuNewb: use find
[06:08] <dell> UbuntuNewb: find --help
[06:08] <Wug> UbuntuNewb: 16 fake gigabytes is 14.9 real ones
[06:08] <Wug> 10^3 versus 2^10
[06:09] <Wug> dont worry about it, your drive is still the same size
[06:09] <UbuntuNewb> When I first inserted the USB it said I had 15.9 max, when I used Unetbootin to install BackTrack it changed suddenly to 14.9
[06:09] <dell> yeah, type df
[06:09] <Wug> you probably just misremember its original capacity
[06:09] <dell> UbuntuNewb: cfdisk
[06:09] <UbuntuNewb> It was five seconds ago, I just went out and bought this
[06:09] <nuf0xx> df -h gives it in human terms
[06:09] <dell> UbuntuNewb: in terminal type cfdisk /dev/sda
[06:10] <Wug> then one of them listed real gigabytes and the other fake ones
[06:10] <cfhowlett> UbuntuNewb, what does startup disk creator say is the capacity?
[06:10] <UbuntuNewb> Before I used Unetbootin, 15.9~ and after, it was 14.9
[06:10] <Wug> "real" being 1073741824 bytes and "fake" being 1000000000 bytes
[06:10] <UbuntuNewb> on Startup Disk Creator
[06:10] <Wug> just trust me, its fine
[06:10] <cfhowlett> UbuntuNewb, as wug has stated, that is normal.
[06:11] <dell> i concur
[06:11] <UbuntuNewb> Okay. Thanks.
[06:11] <Wug> people who sell things love to sell less than what you paid for
[06:11] <dell> yeah
[06:11] <UbuntuNewb> It just confused me because it read two different amounts of data on it.
[06:11] <dell> UbuntuNewb: cfdisk /dev/sda
[06:11] <Wug> selling 500GB drives that only hold 465GB is their way of making asses of themselves
[06:12] <Wug> one was proper gigabytes and the other wasnt
[06:12] <histo> Wug: No that's how hard drive works
[06:12] <Wug> histo: why isnt it how SSDs work
[06:12] <Wug> you'd think they could at least pick one.
[06:12] <dell> 500 billion bytes dont make 500 gb, here is the trick
[06:12] <UbuntuNewb> Dell: I get FATAL ERROR: Cannot open disk drive
[06:12] <Wug> and everyone in the computer world thinks a gigabyte is 2^30 bytes
[06:12] <histo> Wug: They have picked one. You ahve to account for space of inodes and parittion tables etc...
[06:13] <dell> UbuntuNewb: well then your disk drive has been fried, maybe it is not even there.. i would open the box and look
[06:13] <dell> UbuntuNewb: sudo cfdisk /dev/sda
[06:13] <Wug> dell: or the somewhat more likely diagnosis, "its not sda"
[06:13] <UbuntuNewb> Oh, lol, sudo worked.
[06:13] <dell> hda?
[06:13] <Wug> or sudo was missing.
[06:14] <UbuntuNewb> I see 4 partitions on the drive.
[06:14] <dell> they used to be called hda's... maybe sda means SCSI?
[06:14] <dock> gigabyte has now been standardized as 1,000,000,000.  "Gibibyte" is the new term for the power of two.  Thus GiB vs GB.
[06:14] <Wug> I was thinking more along the lines of sdb
[06:14] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  It's confusing because 1024 bits = a Mbit ... however over the years ... a Mbit has been shortened to 1000 bits
[06:14] <dell> UbuntuNewb: add them up to see how many gb you have
[06:14] <UbuntuNewb> They changed it from 1024?
[06:14] <Wug> dock: when your computer savvy friend says gigabyte to you, what do you think
[06:15] <apm1> wow so ubuntu 12.04 has this new entry in the proprietary driver installer (jockey)experimental xorg and amd binary driver module)
[06:15] <apm1> is this the fglrx driver
[06:15] <apm1> being adapted as a kernel module
[06:15] <dell> apm1: i installed ATI driver a minute ago, and now X wont work, i am on console
[06:15] <UbuntuNewb> dell: 320072.95 MB
[06:16] <dell> UbuntuNewb: that should be enough for a man
[06:16] <apm1> dell, this new module you mean or the stable ones in the 12.04 repo ?
[06:16] <UbuntuNewb> Okay. As long as I'm not hauling around this virus (I swear I'm not paranoid) to my next install :D
[06:17] <dell> apm1: no idea.. i installed in the software center... it is called "ati binary driver"
[06:17] <apm1> dell, did it also say its in experimental stage ?
[06:17] <apm1> in the descriptions
[06:18] <dell> apm1: hmm, didnt really check... it was 82 mb, so maybe thats a clue
[06:18] <apm1> dell, what card do you have ?
[06:18] <dell> apm1: something awesome i am sure, this is a brand new laptop with 6 gb ram
[06:18] <apm1> run "lspci"
[06:18] <dell> ok
[06:18] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  It's just that the marketing people can't perform math ... so they shortened it to 1000
[06:18] <apm1> dell, patebin the result
[06:18] <apm1> dell, don't flood
[06:19] <dell> apm1: Radeon HD 7600M
[06:19] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick I'm sorry to sound repetitive but... how come Startup Disk gave me two different results?
[06:19] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick I'm just confused.
[06:20] <apm1> dell, i don't think the driver which you installed had support for such a new card
[06:21] <dell> apm1: can this card run battlefield 3 in your opinion?
[06:21] <apm1> dell, owners of these new cards need to stay with the default opensource drivers until we figure out how to proprely handle the 13.1 catalyst driver
[06:21] <apm1> dell, i think so yes it can handle it
[06:22] <dell> apm1: ok so you suggest that i use the ubuntu's own driver for the video card? how do i roll back to it? i am on console
[06:22] <dell> apm1: ah, right, i will install aptitide and search for it
[06:22] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  i may be confused on  your issue ... but have you considered the formating overhead
[06:23] <dell> Tex_Nick: i think his harddisk is hexed, it needs exorcism
[06:23] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick My name isn't sarcastic, I really am pretty new to this stuff so... overhead?
[06:23] <purplerain> How do i install driver for Broadcom BCM4313? i tried installing the driver from Jockey but it fail to install, also is there open-source version for this driver? thanks

[06:24]  * UbuntuNewb laughs. apm1: It's okay. I don't know what EFI is.
[06:24] <cfhowlett> purplerain, what version of ubuntu on what machine?
[06:25] <apm1> ubuntulog,my mac gives me 2 diff drives to boot from from an ubuntu live cd

[06:25] <apm1> ok
[06:25] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  ok i wasn't trying to insult you ... when a storage device is created ... there is a portion of it that is dedicated to keeping track of the information it contains
[06:26] <cfhowlett> purplerain, surprised that doesn't just workk ... my lenovo thinkpad got it on the first boot

[06:26] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick It's cool, I'm learning and that's why I'm using linux, to learn so. Yay, teach me stuff!
[06:26] <cfhowlett> purplerain, you ran setttings > additional drivers?
[06:26] <apm1> UbuntuNewb, did you try booting from any of the 2 options ?
=== Wug is now known as Wug[Hyperspace]
[06:27] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick Is this like a seperate log partition to keep track of the data that goes in and out of it?
[06:28] <apm1> UbuntuNewb, no MBR is master boot record which kinda contains your bootloader
[06:28] <apm1> in ubuntu's case GRUB
[06:28] <purplerain> cfhowlett: yes i did ran jockey, but the driver failed to install. do you want to look at log ?
[06:28] <UbuntuNewb> apm1 I am in the process of installing Ubuntu on the computer in question now, I'm booting normally from the default option usually.
[06:28] <cfhowlett> purplerain, nope.
[06:28] <UbuntuNewb> apm1 So this is what contains the code that tells the computer, "Hey, you can boot with this"?
[06:28] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  that portion is a catalog of all the locations of all the files on it ... so that information requires some space on the device ... therefore the device has less space for actual data
[06:28] <dell> apm1: i installed mesa-utils the other day to run WOW on wine.. could that be why it is broken?
[06:29] <apm1> UbuntuNewb, grub is the thing that boots the kernel
[06:29] <apm1> dell, not sure
[06:29] <UbuntuNewb> Tex_Nick Okay, I think I'm with you guys now.

[06:29] <UbuntuNewb> apm1 Gotchya.
[06:30] <YusufMH> Good morning, i've got a problem with intalling team speak 3
[06:30] <Tex_Nick> dell : no MBR is a small portion at the beginning of the device to point to the os loadersd
[06:31] <UbuntuNewb> apm1 Tex_Nick So this is basically how the drive gets from the BIOS and CMOS into the actual OS and GUI etc right?
[06:31] <YusufMH> Good morning, i've got a problem with intalling team speak 3,it's not .sh or .deb file,, I click on it and not working, although I'm sure i gave the file the permission to be executed, any idea friends?
[06:31] <purplerain> cfhowlett: Ok, is there open source driver for BCM4313? proprietary drivers like those for nvidia always gave me a headache :/

[06:31] <cfhowlett> purplerain, yes, broadcom has released their opensource driver.

[06:32] <YusufMH> Help please :S

[06:33] <UbuntuNewb> apm1 I was just making sure I was with you guys so far. So, when I made this thing into a boot disk, some of my information was missing because it created an MBR (namely, GRUB)?
[06:33] <YusufMH> Ok sorry.
[06:33] <Tex_Nick> UbuntuNewb :  MBR is the first sector on a boot device that is read ... it then points to other locations of the device to continue loadfing the system

[06:35] <cfhowlett> purplerain, as I said, I used the *no internet access* method and the 10.04 iso to install broadcom drivers.  Went swimmingly well and had full configuration in less than 5 minutes...

I tried restarting unity but it restarts frozen again.
[06:52] <cfhowlett> UbuntuNewb, but the account you run daily is your "admin" account and has admin privileges?  MIGHT want to use a non-privileged account for your daily computing...

[07:10] <Senjai> Hello, I'm trying to uninstall 12.04 LTS (its not working well) and install the latest version. When i previously did this (I think with 10.x) someone here reccomened a program that both could remove the partition, AND fix the MBR / boot issues. Does anyone know about this method?
[07:11] <Senjai> I'm more concerned about the MBR, as I can simply just delete the Ubuntu partition, I'm trying to avoid the system repair disc
[07:11] <TheLordOfTime> hillary, what likely happened is it was installed by hand from source, rather than dpkg, if you're saying it exists but apt-get/dpkg say otherwise
[07:11] <cfhowlett> YusufMH, furthermore, as the channel takes queries, YOUR question gets scrolled up and out of view.  Re-ask your question at reasonable intervals for best results.
[07:11] <dell> hillary: after you type  sudo apt-get remove eclipse, hit on tab twice while your cursor is still right after "eclipse"
[07:11] <cfhowlett> Senjai, you don't need to unintstall, just install the 12.10 over 12.04 ...
[07:12] <dell> hillary: alternatively, open ubuntu software center, and search for "eclipse".. when you find it uninstall
[07:12] <Senjai> cfhowlett, but 12.04 is running horribly slow. I think there was issues when I was installing it the first time. So i'd like to run a fresh install
[07:12] <hillary> TheLordOfTime: you are correct . I installed by hand
[07:12] <YusufMH> Sorry for being rude S:,, i will repost it,,,
[07:12] <YusufMH> Good morning, i've got a problem with intalling team speak 3,it's not .sh or .deb file,, I click on it and not working, although I'm sure i gave the file the permission to be executed, any idea friends?
[07:12] <diegojsRW> I found NetActViewer, but in another site. I'm downloading it and i'll test it. Thanks anyway
[07:13] <cfhowlett> Senjai, ok then reinstall, manually select your partitions and format those partitions.  previous install and configurations get wiped ...
[07:13] <MasterOfDisaster> YusufMH: run 'file' on it, what does it say?
[07:13] <YusufMH> command not found.
[07:13] <dell> hillary:  just do a "ps xa" then delete all the files you see in there that you think is related to eclipse... or just do: sudo rm `which eclipse` .. if it is a binary
[07:14] <TheLordOfTime> hillary, by hand as in you downloaded the files and moved them around per eclipse's installation guides?
[07:14] <Senjai> cfhowlett, okay, but the second part of my question is fixing the boot record (as ubuntu modifies it). I guess this is more of a windows issue and i understand if it cannot be answered here. I was given an exe that simply autorestored it without having to use a sys repair disk
[07:14] <cfhowlett> Senjai, does everything currently boot?
[07:14] <MasterOfDisaster> YusufMH: sudo apt-get install file ; file <yourfile>
[07:14] <Senjai> Yes
[07:14] <Senjai> Windows 7 and Ubuntu 12.04
[07:14] <hillary> TheLordOfTime: yes
[07:14] <Senjai> cfhowlett, I think the problem with 10.10 (i think) was GRUB, i noticed that there is no Grub this time)
[07:15] <cfhowlett> Senjai, ok then, when the installation reaches that point, install grub  to /dev/sda and you should be fine...
[07:15] <cfhowlett> Senjai, you're reinstalling 12.04?
[07:15] <chaz68> Any of you folks run the Ubuntu / Debian install method for Ajaxplorer here recently?   http://ajaxplorer.info/download/
[07:15] <YusufMH> MasterOfDisaster it says : E: Unable to locate package /home/yusuf/Downloads
[07:15] <Senjai> cfhowlett, I want to remove 12.04, and install 12.10 (i think thats the current version)
[07:15] <YusufMH> but it's in the downloads folder.
[07:15] <chaz68> It works but I've got some errors...
[07:16] <MasterOfDisaster> YusufMH: if the filename contains spaces, run 'file "filename"'
[07:16] <cfhowlett> Senjai, ok, same process.  the current boot/grub will get overwritten by the 12.10 installation
[07:16] <TheLordOfTime> hillary, you'll have to remove them by hand then, or use dell's suggesteion
[07:16] <cfhowlett> Senjai, note: you will be MANUALLY partitioning.  do NOT format your windows, of course
[07:16] <chaz68> Specifically can't run the "runTests.php" diagnostics after the first run anymore in Ajaxplorer.
[07:17] <YusufMH>  MasterOfDisaster This is how I runned the command, looks wrong right? how is the right way?
[07:17] <Senjai> cfhowlett, I know how to remove the 12.04 partition. Should I just format it, install 12.10 in its place (without adjusting the partition)
[07:17] <YusufMH> sudo apt-get install '/home/yusuf/Downloads/Teamspeak_3-3.0.2-Linux-x86-Install'
[07:17] <Senjai> and rely on 12.10 to fix the boot record?
[07:17] <Senjai> Aka, just as long as I dont shut down between removing 12.04 and installing 12.10 i should be fine
[07:17] <chaz68> Platform = 12.04LTS in a VM under VMware V 9.X.
[07:18] <cfhowlett> Senjai, stock ubuntu partition should require about 8 gigs for the /
[07:18] <Senjai> cfhowlett, the one it has allocated atm is 100 gigs
[07:18] <cfhowlett> Senjai, as you're clean installing, yes, format the /
[07:18] <cfhowlett> Senjai, I was speaking ONLY of the / not the /home or data storage.
[07:19] <Senjai> cfhowlett,  I found the program i was previously suggested
[07:19] <cfhowlett> Senjai, as you're reinstalling you might wish to consider making a separate /home for your user data.
[07:19] <Senjai> cfhowlett, http://neosmart.net/EasyBCD/ for your records, thanks for your help though.
[07:19] <cfhowlett> Senjai, best of luck
[07:19] <Senjai> cfhowlett, I have all my user data backed up to my windows partition for the reinstall
[07:20] <Senjai> I just mounted it in Ubuntu
[07:20] <diegojsRW> You can too use Windows bootloader to boot ubuntu. I made it on my notebook, where I installed Windows XP, WIndows Seven and Ubuntu Quantal Quetzal
[07:20] <ClientAlive> I'm having trouble finding any instruction on installing oracle jdk-7 and java EE on ubuntu. I run 12.04 desktop and I've had it so that I didn't have to remove openjdk before. I remember doing something in update-alternatives and being able to keep both but use oracle as the default. Can someone help me understand how to do this?
[07:20] <diegojsRW> To do it, you have to have Windows DVD, to use "Recovery options"
[07:21] <diegojsRW> This assuming you cannot boot onto windows
[07:21] <chaz68> ClientAlive:  There is a repository for Oracle 7.  Let me find it.  Think I have a link...  It's not ubuntu official repository though...
[07:21] <ikonia> ClientAlive: you can install it, the alternatives file just creates symlinks from java to /usr/local/java - or where ever you put it
[07:21] <chaz68> Oracle Java sdk 7 that is...
[07:21] <ClientAlive> this is fine. Is perfect. thank you
[07:21] <diegojsRW> If you can boot onto windows naturally, then you can do it from a Command prompt inside Windows environment
[07:22] <ClientAlive> sweet
[07:22] <diegojsRW> The program used is "bcdedit.exe"
[07:23] <ClientAlive> chaz68: Is it this?  ppa:webupd8team/java
[07:24] <hillary>  what command do i use to completely remove  eclipse directory inside opt folder
[07:24] <ikonia> hillary: rm -rf directory_name
[07:24] <TheLordOfTime> ClientAlive, yes it is
[07:24] <chaz68> Yep:  That's the one:  Instructions I used are here and elsewhere... http://www.blogs.digitalworlds.net/softwarenotes/2013/01/28/install-java-jdk-7-for-ubuntu-12-04/
[07:25] <ClientAlive> chaz68: ok but I'm not seeing instructin related to java ee. jre yes, ee no.  :(
[07:25] <ClientAlive> is there a way to install jdk and ee from that repo?
[07:25] <TheLordOfTime> chaz68, are you looking for a specific version of java though?
[07:25] <TheLordOfTime> erm ClientAlive^
[07:25] <hillary> ikonia: thank you very much
[07:26] <ClientAlive> latest version please
[07:26] <ClientAlive> java jdk 7 and ee
[07:26] <TheLordOfTime> ClientAlive, you'll have to do it by hand - i don't thinkn webupd8team keeps enterprise edition in the repos
[07:26] <TheLordOfTime> s/repos/ppa/
[07:26] <TheLordOfTime> maybe some licensing thing or something
[07:26] <TheLordOfTime> idk
[07:27] <ClientAlive> TheLordOfTime: I see. Well I'll google ubout that repo but at least I know what I'm up agains.
[07:27] <ClientAlive> thx
[07:27] <TheLordOfTime> ClientAlive, that repo won't have it, trust me.

[07:29] <hillary> i have been using winff to convert mp4 to mp3 etc ubuntu 12.04, but it is no longer converting. what could have happened?
[07:29] <ikonia> ClientAlive: you really need to research harder
[07:29] <hillary> any help
[07:29] <ikonia> if you don't know if it's the right one, or how to use it you should not be doing it
[07:29] <TheLordOfTime> agreed with ikonia
[07:29] <ikonia> ClientAlive: you really need to research what you've got and how to use it before considering using it

[07:30] <UltraParadigm> Hi everyone!
[07:30] <Rakko> hi UltraParadigm
[07:31] <Rakko> I wish I could remember the question I came in here to answer
[07:31] <Rakko> oh! that's it.
[07:31] <ClientAlive> ikonia: true - not what I needed to hear. I'm overwhelemed wtih the stuff I already have on my plate. I just want a dev environment I can satisfy my curiosities with. I hope no one is going to expect I become and expert in java development before having jave ee on my machine - else how would I become that expert anyway?
[07:31] <Rakko> First, is there a way to ask ubottu for FAQs? I /msged ubottu help but got no response.
[07:31] <ClientAlive> pointless to argue I guess. seems I'm on my own again.
[07:32] <dsnyders> Hi all!  I have created a /tmp partition in ram.  How do I get rid of the old /tmp that was in my root folder?  I presume it is still there taking up space.
[07:32] <ikonia> ClientAlive: you don't have to be an expert, but a.) knowing how to use the file you are trying to use b.) knowing if it's the right version are critical
[07:32] <ikonia> ClientAlive: as you know neither of these things, I'd suggest at least a basic level of research
[07:32] <ikonia> Rakko: there is no "FAQ"
[07:32] <ikonia> !faq > Rakko
[07:32] <ubottu> Rakko, please see my private message
[07:32] <Rakko> thanks
[07:33] <Rakko> dsnyders: you have to unmount the /tmp; that will unshadow it so you see what's there under /tmp on the root partition
[07:33] <Rakko> delete that stuff and then remount /tmp
[07:33] <hillary> I have been using winff to convert mp4 to mp3 etc ubuntu 12.04, but it is no longer converting. what could have happened?
[07:33] <dsnyders> Rakko: /me slaps forehead.  Now why didn't I think of that.
[07:35] <Rakko> OK, I think I'll just ask. -> How do I make mouse scrolling work the old fashioned way, i.e. where scrolling starts instantly instead of requiring a little movement before it gets started?
[07:35] <hillary> ikonia: any idea, i have been using winff to convert mp4 to mp3 etc ubuntu 12.04, but it is no longer converting. what could have happened?
[07:36] <dr_willis> hillary:  have winff show its  commandline/terminal window its using and look at the command output
[07:36] <joy> Hi !
[07:36] <cfhowlett> joy, greetings
[07:38] <UltraParadigm> I just reinstalled Ubuntu.. again. Its like the 5th time in just 2 weeks
[07:38] <UltraParadigm> This time I'm trying Studio64, cause I totally effed up the sound in my regular 12.10.   Sofar, I don't miss unity at all.
[07:39] <UltraParadigm> But I do think I'll get KVirc again.  Xchat isn't impressing me
[07:39] <dr_willis> irc clients dont need to be impressive.. just functional. ;0
[07:39] <hillary> dr_willis, : it display: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1584717/
[07:40] <UltraParadigm> nah nah, they need to have bells, and whistles, and real transparancy.
[07:40] <UltraParadigm> but especially the whistles!
[07:40] <dr_willis> hillary:  but does the command succede
[07:41] <UltraParadigm> I just went through the trouble of getting compiz to work with xfcse, no way am I ending up with an ugly irc.
[07:41] <hillary> dr_willis,  no
[07:42] <dr_willis> try the commands from a bash shell and see if they work. and what errors they give
[07:42] <hillary> dr_willis,  infact it has hanged up. Guide me how to
[07:42] <UltraParadigm> I've reinstalled Ubuntu so many times since I built my new PC that I'm almost ready to install it for other people for a fee :-)  I have a checklist and everything.  I've gotten quite efficient at it.
[07:47] <hillary> how do i kill a hanging process ubuntu 12.04. i window has refused to close!
[07:47] <dr_willis> xkill is one way  hillary
[07:47] <dr_willis> kill -9 , or killall are other ways

[07:50] <jarray52> I previously had the ATI catalyst driver working on this machine(has a switchable GPU Intel/ATI) on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. After an upgrade to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS with the 3.5.0-22 kernel, I can't recall how I got the ATI radeon drivers working. Any suggestions?
[07:51] <jarray52> I believe my machine is currently using the i915 intel driver.
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[07:53] <jarray52> I also had problems with the fglrx drivers provided by the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS repositories.
[07:53] <dsnyders> Rakko: Thanks for your assistance re /tmp.  I had to shut down a few services, like mysql and Xorg, but once I got them shut down I was able to unmount/delete/remount /tmp.
[07:54] <MasterOfDisaster> UltraParadigm: irssi + transparent konsole? *hides*
[07:54] <Rakko> cool, dsnyders
[07:54] <UltraParadigm> I switched back to kvirc
=== atrius is now known as atrius_away
[07:55] <Rakko> this scrolling is driving me nuts
[07:55] <UltraParadigm> console irc, eww, haven't done that in years
[07:55] <UltraParadigm> Wont go back to it
[07:55] <Rakko> I just started liking irssi
[07:55] <dsnyders> Rakko, what scrolling?
[07:56] <hillary> This winff has refused!
[07:56] <UltraParadigm> I used to do iirc back in the days when I used pine to check my email.  hehe
[07:56] <dr_willis> hillary:  if the command that winff is using dosent work. it hangs.. then its not a winff issue
[07:56] <Rakko> dsnyders: whenever I scroll in ubuntu 12.10 it takes me quite a bit of effort before the scrolling actually starts. I'm not sure if that's related to my running this on a Mac or in VirtualBox, or if all scrolling is like this now.
[07:56] <dr_willis> hillary:  winff is just a front end to the cli tools. that command you pasted is doing the actual work
[07:56] <UltraParadigm> I kind of miss pine
[07:57] <Rakko> I think it's supposed to be imitating tablet scrolling, but I'm not sure. I wish I knew some search terms to use to fix it.
[07:57] <UltraParadigm> I have fond memories of pine.  I did some good email reading with that.
[07:57] <Rakko> I still like mutt
[07:57] <Rakko> but anyway I have to do the two-finger swipe *halfway* across my trackpad for scrolling to even start
[07:58] <Rakko> is there a name for this?
[07:58] <dsnyders> Rakko: Is scrolling responsive with your mouse?
[07:58] <Rakko> I haven't tried a mouse

[07:59] <dsnyders> Rakko, Plug one in and try.  That would tell you if it is the virtualbox or the trackpad gesture.

[07:59] <UltraParadigm> Alright, automatic nick serv works.  And everyting is as it should be.  The universe is back in balance.    Now to test the one thing that I reinstalled studio for.    jack

[08:00] <dr_willis> vbox has 2 kinds of mouse polling also.. it can goof up in some areas
[08:00] <hillary> dr_willis, can i remove and reinstall again?
[08:01] <Rakko> problem is I don't know where my mouse is
[08:01] <Rakko> dr_willis, dsnyders: so I gather that neither of you notice the annoying before I'm describing?
[08:03] <quietone> my partner just booted laptop, closed lid, opened lid. Now the screen is blank and kybd unresponsive. Dell Inspiron 15R, 12.04
[08:04] <dsnyders> Rakko, nope.  Mostly because I'm running linux directly on standard PC desktop hardware, including a mouse.  Maybe later, when I get virtualbox going, I might notice it... if I had a trackpad.
[08:04] <quietone> it is set to not suspend when lid is closed
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[08:05] <dr_willis> hillary:  removeing and reinstalling the same binaryes dosent change anything.. thats windows thinking...
[08:05] <dr_willis> hillary:  try the command from the terminal. see if it works
[08:06] <dr_willis> Rakko:  ive noticed in some disrtos (like tiny core linux) in vbox I have to enable some mouse settings or sles the pointers are off position. but ive never noticed the issue in ubuntu in vbox
[08:06] <Rakko> ok
[08:07] <hillary> dr_willis, which command please
[08:07] <quietone> Is this the problem "apparmor="DENIED" operation="open" parent=1 profile="/usr/lib/lightdm/lightdm/lightdm-guest-session-wrapper""
[08:07] <dr_willis> hillary:  the one i pasted above.. the MAIN command of the pastebin you did...
[08:07] <UltraParadigm> quietone:  You should disable the sleepmode at laptop close then.  Probably can't handle it.
[08:07] <dsnyders> Rakko: https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=36376 maybe?
[08:08] <quietone> UltraParadigm, we don't recall seeing anything for 'sleepmode'. Where is that?
[08:08] <UltraParadigm> quietone:  also, sometimes a bios upgrade will help.
[08:09] <Rakko> dsnyders: could be the same thing

[08:11] <Rakko> yeah, in native OS X it's fine
[08:11] <Rakko> and in my Windows VMware VM
[08:12] <quietone> UltraParadigm, I'm sshed into it. is there anything I can do, besides shutdown -r now, to make it usable?
[08:12] <UltraParadigm> there is also another tool option also, if the gnome tweek doens't work.
[08:12] <dsnyders> Rakko: Have you tried asking on a virtualbox chat channel?
[08:12] <UltraParadigm> probably not.  I'm suprised that you can even remote to it
[08:13] <UltraParadigm> if you can indeed remote to it, you can kill the xserver
[08:13] <UltraParadigm> that might help
[08:13] <quietone> UltraParadigm, I'm not fluent in x. how do I do that?
[08:13] <UltraParadigm> run "ps -e | grep X"
[08:14] <UltraParadigm> and then take note of the process number

[08:16] <sweetpea> how long is it meant to take to make a ubuntu usb
[08:16] <UltraParadigm> dsnyders: beats me :-).  I alway kill it when it freezes on me, then it just restarts automatically
[08:16] <sweetpea> i just downloaded it and its taking like 10 minutes so far
[08:17] <UltraParadigm> quietone: ahh, sounds like you are screwed.  I recommend getting a bios update from the manufacturer's website.

[08:17] <np8> Hi! Could anyone here help me with a partition problem? I have a 30Gb Ubuntu partition (/dev/sda6, ext4). I just took a 80Gb of space from my Windows data -partition, and now it is shown as "unallocated" in GParted. Is there a way to add this 80Gb to be in Ubuntu's use? A screenshot of my partitions (GParted) http://ubuntuone.com/1TjFW2bSBNm0n9XDTUFNe1 (sorry, it's in Finnish)
[08:17] <UltraParadigm> If that doesn't fix the issue, then you will have no choice but to disable the sleeping
[08:17] <quietone> dsnyders, there isn't a gdm but there is lightdm
[08:17] <prih> ciao
[08:18] <iceroot> np8: just use the resize function from gparted
[08:18] <sweetpea> it sounds like youve accidently deleted the windows ntfs partition
[08:18] <iceroot> np8: and resize the ubuntu partition with the unallocated
[08:19] <sweetpea> ow im dumb lol
[08:19] <dsnyders> quietone: That would be your desktop manager.  Gdm is (or was) gnome's.
[08:19] <np8> iceroot: It doesn't work because I can't detach the Ubuntu partition, because it is in use. :/
[08:19] <cfhowlett> np8, you can do so by moving the free partition next to the one you want to add it to.
[08:20] <quietone> dsnyders, yea I used to have to restart gdm a lot on my Debian wheezy.
[08:20] <iceroot> np8: use a live-system
[08:20] <iceroot> np8: never change a partition which is in use
[08:21] <np8> iceroot: What's a live-system?
[08:21] <np8> cfhowlett: The Ubuntu partition is un use, so it doesn't work
[08:21] <dsnyders> np8: linux on cd or linux on usb flash
[08:21] <iceroot> np8: use the ubuntu-iso and start it instead of your installed system, that system will be running directly from you ram
[08:21] <Rakko> nope, that didn't fix it.
[08:21] <antonio_> I'm trying to install adobe air...
[08:21] <iceroot> np8: and so your hdd is not mounted and you can change it
[08:21] <Rakko> Oh well, tomorrow I may find my mouse.
[08:22] <cfhowlett> np8, right.  my bad..  boot an ubuntu usb/cd and run gparted

[08:23] <Rakko> I was in #vbox but it was dead. I was asking a different question there.

[08:25] <TomyLobo> cub: apt-get remove x
[08:25] <cub> just a troll q, dr_willis  :P jk
[08:25] <ripthejacker> *color
[08:25] <cub> im here to help today if i can
[08:25] <cub> haha
[08:26] <dr_willis> ripthejacker:  since less cant display colors.. that makes sence. there might be a color option for less or more.
[08:26] <TomyLobo> dr_willis ripthejacker -R
[08:26] <ripthejacker> but will it colorize only the patterns that grep matched
[08:26] <dr_willis> -r  -R  ....  --raw-control-chars  --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS
[08:26] <antonio_> I'm trying to install adobe air...I've followed these directions..and its not working
[08:27] <TomyLobo> less -R will pass through the colors
[08:27] <Rakko> dr_willis: less *can* display colors
[08:27] <dr_willis> antonio_:  last i looked adobe air has worked on linux in like over a year..
[08:27] <Rakko> sorry, spoke too late
[08:27] <TomyLobo> grep --color=always will make grep emit colors even if it detects a pipe
[08:27] <TomyLobo> gotta run, see ya
[08:27] <Rakko> air has *not* worked on linux in over a year
[08:28] <antonio_> dr_willis: I've gotten it to work before..just can't remember how...
[08:28] <antonio_> I had to make a symbolic link with this command
[08:28] <antonio_> sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnome-keyring.so.0 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnome-keyring.so.0.2.0
[08:28] <antonio_> ln: failed to create symbolic link `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgnome-keyring.so.0.2.0': File exis
[08:28] <dsnyders> dr_willis: TomyLobo, I've been looking for that for a while, but never got around to asking.
[08:28] <dr_willis>  ls --color=always | less -R
[08:28] <antonio_> how can I delete that symbolic link so I can start over?
[08:28] <dr_willis> rm thelink
[08:28] <ripthejacker> dr_willis, yes that worked
[08:28] <ripthejacker> grep --color-always | less -R
[08:28] <ripthejacker> :)
[08:28] <dr_willis> without the -R - it shows the esc codes
[08:29]  * dsnyders goes to alias less with less -R
[08:29] <dr_willis> i wonder ls and grep  detect they are being piped
[08:29] <ripthejacker> thanks dr_willis , TomyLobo
[08:31] <Rakko> you can also set the LESS env var to -R
[08:32] <dsnyders> dr_willis: they probably detect pipes and shut down coloring because they date back to the days when you piped output to terminals and printers and modems and such.
[08:32] <Rakko> grep also has an env var like that, but I found that if I set it to always send color, some programs calling grep would break
[08:33] <Rakko> dsnyders: even today, piping to other processes is mostly done without color. It would be a huge mess for the pipee to have to decipher the color codes.
[08:33] <dsnyders> true
[08:34] <Guido1> what is the coment to tell crontab to start a playlist in the home directory with rhythmbox
[08:34] <Guido1> ?
[08:34] <Rakko> ls also changes its output to one name per line
[08:35] <dsnyders> Well, I have to be up in 4 hrs, so g'night folks.
[08:36] <atsui> I am currently connected via VNC to a Ubuntu 12.04 machine running vnc4server. I can see the VNC service running with  nmap  as expected. However, when I run "sudo ufw status verbose", it shows that only ports 22 nd 8080 are set as ALLOW IN and the default policy for incoming is set to deny. How come I am allowed to connect?
[08:37] <Ben64> !ufw | atsui
[08:37] <ubottu> atsui: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.
[08:39] <atsui> ubottu, so even though ufw should block the VNC connection, would it be possible the rules for iptables still let in VNC?
[08:39] <ubottu> atsui: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[08:39] <atsui> doh lol
[08:40] <adamlis> Hey. I have a Ubuntu Server that I really like. I want to setup a PXE-boot for windows 7 for a few computers here at work without cd-rom.. does anyone know of a good guide? i've tried googling and using the man commando

[08:52] <Rakko> bye
[08:52] <Nitesh> +i Nitesh
[08:53] <Nitesh> hi
[08:53] <cfhowlett> Nitesh, greetings
[08:53] <Nitesh> is there any girl for chat
[08:55] <Ben64> this channel is for ubuntu support only, not for chatting
[08:55] <Nitesh> hi i am Nitesh ...
=== apos is now known as Rin
[08:55] <cfhowlett> Nitesh, wrong channel
[08:57] <cub> how o i install xubuntu on this...
[08:57] <cub> well i mean the desktop environment
[08:57] <cub> i forgot the name of it :\
[08:58] <cfhowlett> cub, 2 choices: pure xfce or xubuntu
[08:58] <cub> well xfce
[08:58] <Guido1> hello?anyone with experinces in starting a playlist in rhythmbox with cron?
[08:58] <cfhowlett> cub, sudo apt-get install xfce will give you DE only, sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop will give you xubuntu
[08:59] <cub> it wont ruin my unity install will it?
[08:59] <Ben64> cfhowlett, cub: xfce4, not just xfce
[08:59] <Nitesh> #ubuntu
[08:59] <cub> okay, but if i install Xubuntu, can i still log into the unity environment?
[08:59] <Ben64> cub: yes, you can choose before you log in
[09:00] <cub> okay i'll install xubuntu
[09:01] <Ben64> only problem with doing xubuntu-desktop is that you'll have duplicates of certain things, like text editors and whatnot
[09:01] <cub> can that be correcteed Ben64 ?
[09:01] <ClientAlive> This is simply too confusing to me. I NEED to have java sdk and ee installed for school projects. I don't have time to research it the project is coming due. I beg of you. Is there anyone who will help me?
[09:02] <Ben64> cub: well if you don't want two text editors and stuff like that, just install xfce4
[09:02] <cub> when u say two text editors you mean literaly two of the same program?
[09:02] <Sling> ClientAlive: if you still need to install the sdk/ee when your project is almost due, how is that our problem?
=== raven is now known as pixxiedust
=== pixxiedust is now known as pixie_dust
[09:04] <ClientAlive> bc damit I came askoing politely for help earlier and all I got was I need to explain how to use it like I'm some expert or I shouldn't be messing wtih it. Damit it's mot my fault if I don't know everythign abotu java ee. i still have to have it. When I asked nicely earlier I didn't expect to get a debate about whether I should be installig it. I have to install it.
[09:04] <cub> if i dont like xubuntu i can uninstall it via 'remove' correct?
[09:04] <cub> apt-get remove <package>?
[09:04] <ClientAlive> I don't uderstand what I'm seeing on google Ifor the last hour) lord knows I tried
[09:04] <cfhowlett> cub, sudo apt-get purge xfce
[09:04] <cub> okay
[09:04] <pixie_dust> hey guys, i just installed ubuntu on my pc, im havving too many issues with getting it on my laptop at the moment, but on my pc i install the flgx? or whattever driver, for my graphics, and when i restarted i had no desktop,
[09:05] <ClientAlive> 1698 other ppl and the only ones will talk to me want to give me shit?
[09:05] <hammerAndsickle> Where is terminal located in the GUI?
[09:05] <cfhowlett> ClientAlive, attitude is everything
[09:05] <Ben64> cub: not really.... xubuntu-desktop is a meta package, installs many other ones. if you keep a list of what it installs you can undo it
[09:05] <cfhowlett> cub, if you want JUST the de, install xfce
[09:05] <pixie_dust> so i rightclicked and went to appearance and navigated back to software sources and set it back to xorg, they are the only 2 drivers in addition drivers so what drivers should i use
[09:05] <DaemonicApathy> hammerAndsickle: click on the ubuntu logo at the top left, type in "terminal" and click on the correct icon.
[09:05] <cub> okay well i'll give it a shot
[09:05] <cub> its not that it will bother me just that this hd is so small
[09:05] <cub> i need to upgrade it
[09:06] <DaemonicApathy> I feel the same way about my SSD, cub.
[09:06] <cub> 15gb hard drive...
[09:06] <cub> theres a place here selling 80 gb hard drives for 15 dollars tho
[09:06] <cub> gonna try getting a hold of one
[09:07] <antonio_> I'm trying to install Adobe Air on my system...it works fine, then a terminal window pops up asking me for root password...when I put in the root password it says su: Authentication Failure
[09:07] <antonio_> http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l269/con_movies/Screenshotfrom2013-01-28230338_zpsf82819a3.png
[09:07] <hammerAndsickle> Thanks Daemonic, So there is no icon based app system like OSX?
[09:07] <Guido1> hello? anyone with experinces in starting a playlist in rhythmbox with cron?
[09:08] <Guido1> what is the coment to start a playlist located in the home folder?
[09:08] <antonio_> I'm using the right password, so I have no idea whats going on
[09:08] <elblaze0> <---------------installing ubuntu 12.04  on virtual box right now for first time  =]
[09:09] <cub> well brb
[09:10] <elblaze0> <elblaze0> <---------------installing ubuntu 12.04  on virtual box right now for first time  =]
[09:10] <elblaze0> any advice?
[09:10] <away> regarding?
[09:10] <elblaze0> DLing iso now
[09:11] <elblaze0> going on win 7 64 machine
[09:12] <hammerAndsickle> It's funny that the Ubuntu that comes with Parallels has so many updates after you install it
[09:12] <tapas> hi, are there repositories to install qt5 on ubuntu 12.04?
[09:12] <DaemonicApathy> hammerAndsickle: The Dash is replacing much of the menu system in Ubuntu.
[09:12] <hammerAndsickle> You'd think they would keep that version updated on their servers
[09:12] <DaemonicApathy> You can still go through categories and lists with it if you want, though.
[09:13] <cfhowlett> tapas, it's not in the repos
[09:13] <hammerAndsickle> so it's evolving into more of a search based GUI
[09:13] <tapas> cfhowlett: yeah, i saw though that there are ppa's for ubuntu 12.10
[09:14] <antonio_> I'm trying to install Adobe Air on my system...it works fine, then a terminal window pops up asking me for root password...when I put in the root password it says su: Authentication Failure
[09:14] <antonio_> http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l269/con_movies/Screenshotfrom2013-01-28230338_zpsf82819a3.png
[09:14] <DaemonicApathy> hammerAndsickle: Assuming the standard user only uses a small subset of apps on a regular basis, all the necessary ones will be right there.
[09:14] <pixie_dust> basicly i have an amd graphics card, i installed the fglrx driver, and compiz/unity disnt start when i turned my pc on, so which driver should i use, the xorg one makes my pc slow >_>
[09:14] <DaemonicApathy> hammerAndsickle: And one may always pin an app to the launcher at the left.
[09:14] <cfhowlett> tapas, I run LTS only, so I have 12.044, but I will put 12.10 in a virtualbox
[09:15] <hammerAndsickle> yeah i think that way is more efficient, just curious about the evolution of the system
[09:15] <elblaze0> 12.10 better for virtual box cfhowlett?
[09:16] <dr_willis> antonio_:  run the installer as root to begin with perhaps
[09:16] <dr_willis> antonio_:  its trying to su to root i imagine. which is explicitly disabled on ubuntu
[09:18] <tapas> cfhowlett: we have 12.04 here, too
[09:19] <antonio_> dr_willis: I'm not sure what the command line for adobe air would be...is there anyway to find that on my system?
[09:19] <tapas> cfhowlett: so the ppa's aren't useful.. we'll just go with the qt binary download from qt.org
[09:19] <cfhowlett> elblaze0, I can't say, I only use the virtualbox for testing.  It takes the virtualbox guest addition though
[09:20] <elblaze0> cfhowlett thank you for the info. much appreciated.. first install..
[09:21] <cfhowlett> elblaze0, might I suggest you go with 12.04 long term support.  Unless you actually NEED the bleeding edge of 12.10 ...
[09:21] <elblaze0> ok thank you i will try that
[09:22] <jsjc> I am going nuts with an error (CRON) error (grandchild #6871 failed with exit status 127)
[09:22] <elblaze0> cfhowlett would you say there is a big difference in features and support regarding newer version?
[09:22] <jsjc> have checked online and there is info but none of it fits my problem...
[09:23] <jsjc> I can run command d
[09:23] <jsjc> I can run command with the user that I run the cron task but seems something else.
[09:24] <cfhowlett> elblaze0, support: 12.10 is supported for 18 months, 12.04 for 60 months.  Features: some.  It's really up to the user.  Installing every new version means angst and potential heartburn every 6 months.  Installing LTS only means a more polished version with long term support and lifespan ..
[09:24] <dr_willis> anderson:  no idea. I gaave up on air ages ago. I recall getting itinstalled and it still dident work
[09:24] <dr_willis> oops. that was for antonio_
[09:25] <elblaze0> ok thank you very much DLing 12.04 now instead
[09:26] <antonio_> dr_willis: I know it will work, because I
[09:26] <antonio_> because I installed it recently...just can't remember how
[09:26] <phrozen> hello, I havea problemwith apache + mod_fcgid configuration. Still getting error premature end of scripts. It is quite strange, becouse application runs successfully under centos. Permissions 777 Configuration files attached here: http://pastebin.com/2ZwVG0Mg. Can somebody help me?
[09:26] <cfhowlett> elblaze0, good luck.
[09:26] <phrozen> I am trying to migrate to ubuntu already.
[09:28] <Guido1> hello, i'm just working on a cron script, but got stuck at the coment to start a playlist with rhythmbox. the playlist is in the home folder. can someone help me?
[09:29] <MasterOfDisaster> phrozen: httpd seems fine to me - is the python interpreter set up in the directory that's listed in the fcgi script?
[09:30] <kostkon> Guido1, what's your problem exactly
[09:30] <Pangolin> hello, who else is scratching their head and wondering why QQ 12.10 makes previously simple nvidia driver installation really difficult? I know that proprietary drivers are not the Ubuntu dev's responsibility, but I don't get the removal of Jockey
[09:30] <phrozen> MasterOfDisaster: Interpreter is fine
[09:31] <Guido1> kostkon: rhythmbox is starting, but it doesn't play the playlist
[09:31] <MasterOfDisaster> phrozen: I suggest searching serverfault or stackoverflow for advice on how to troubleshoot this. Without any debugging output or logfile excerpts it's hard to help
[09:31] <Pangolin> followed loads of guides and tried at least three different versions of the nvidia driver including experimental-304 and 310 (and of course current)
[09:31] <MasterOfDisaster> phrozen: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4336757/500-server-error-premature-end-of-script-headers
[09:31] <Ben64> Pangolin: its not very difficult
[09:32] <kostkon> Guido1, are you calling rhytmbox or rhythmbox-client?
[09:32] <Pangolin> it has been for me, I keep having to revert to nouveau to get Unity back
[09:32] <belgianguy> is iptables still seen as secure?
[09:32] <Ben64> Pangolin: need help?
[09:33] <Pangolin> not at that machine now but I'd welcome any suggestions
[09:33] <belgianguy> (I ask because I'm reading a 3yr old book, which references it)
[09:33] <Pangolin> I've also tried with Bumblebee
[09:33] <Guido1> kostkon: at client;  i gues something is wrong with "play-uri=file:home/Lahannya-Dystopia.m3u"
[09:33] <Ben64> Pangolin: do you have dual gpu
=== hammerAndsickle_ is now known as hammerAndsickle
[09:33] <kostkon> Guido1, do you start rhythmbox first?
[09:33] <Ben64> Guido1: that file probably doesn't exist
[09:33] <Pangolin> yes, Dell XPS L510x with Intel GMA and a mid-range nvidia GT540M
[09:34] <xkernel> what is the impact of disabling the avahi-daemon ?
[09:34] <Ben64> Pangolin: oh, well i don't know about those, sorry
[09:34] <Pangolin> np
[09:34] <Guido1> kostkon: yes, i start it first using:
[09:34] <Guido1> XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority
[09:34] <Guido1> DISPLAY=:0.0
[09:34] <Guido1> 58 19 * * * rhythmbox
[09:34] <FloodBot1> Guido1: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[09:34] <Pangolin> the Intel drivers seem fine
[09:35] <pixie_dust> can anyone help me
[09:35] <MasterOfDisaster> belgianguy: iptables is just a management software for the kernel's netfilter tables
[09:35] <Ben64> Pangolin: the whole dual gpu thing was kind of rushed and there are weird implementations of it, so its kind of a mess currently
[09:35] <kostkon> Guido1, and you wait for a couple of secs and then you call rhythmbox-client? what error are you getting from cron
[09:36] <pixie_dust> i just need help with drivers..
[09:36] <antonio_> dr_willis: think I got it solved http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1488609
[09:36] <Ben64> !details | pixie_dust
[09:36] <ubottu> pixie_dust: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[09:36] <theadmin> pixie_dust: What's the problem? Sorry, just joined.
[09:36] <Guido1> kostkon, Ben64: the file exist :-S is somthing wrong with the path?
[09:36] <Ben64> Guido1: looks like it wouldn't exist
[09:36] <pixie_dust> i did. um
[09:37] <kostkon> Guido1, try changing it to file:///home/Lahannya-Dystopia.m3u
[09:37] <pixie_dust> basicly i have an amd graphics card, i installed the fglrx driver, and compiz/unity disnt start when i turned my pc on, so which driver should i use, the xorg one makes my pc slow >_>
[09:37] <Guido1> kostkon: no error. rhythembox is starting, but doesn't play
[09:37] <Ben64> Guido1: where is the file exactly
[09:38] <kostkon> Guido1, then try starting rhythm in debug mode next time and see what you'll get
[09:38] <pixie_dust> should i try the drivers on the amd website..? ive been told in the past not to do that
[09:38] <theadmin> pixie_dust: The opensource one worked fine for me when I was on AMD. But don't go to the website, that's just fglrx so if you have that that won't fix anything.
[09:38] <theadmin> And fglrx is in the repos anyway
[09:39] <theadmin> pixie_dust: You could try the experimental version
[09:39] <theadmin> !info fglrx-experimental-9 | pixie_dust
[09:39] <ubottu> pixie_dust: Package fglrx-experimental-9 does not exist in quantal
[09:39] <pixie_dust> oh.. well when i installed the fglrx one from the addition drivers section of software sources, i rebooted and compiz and unity didnt start, just a blank desktop
[09:39] <theadmin> Eh, that's from precise
[09:39] <theadmin> SOrry
[09:39] <Guido1> kostkon: i will try that
[09:39] <Guido1> Ben64: in the home folder
[09:40] <pixie_dust> im on 12.10 on my pc, this is my laptop
[09:40] <theadmin> pixie_dust: I see... Hm, do you have dual graphics?
[09:40] <kostkon> Guido1, e.g. rhythmbox -D > ~/Destktop/rhythm_out.txt
[09:40] <Ben64> Guido1: the home folder or _your_ home folder
[09:40] <kostkon> Guido1, sorry, that should be: rhythmbox -d > ~/Destktop/rhythm_out.txt
[09:40] <pixie_dust> no no, just the ati 7950
[09:40] <phrozen> MasterOfDisaster: but where can I find any helpful logs? Apache is giving only information about premature end of script headers. Only this error log I can see.
[09:40] <theadmin> pixie_dust: Okay... Hit Ctrl+Alt+F2 and log in, then type "sudo aticonfig --initial"
[09:41] <theadmin> pixie_dust: Then "sudo reboot" and see if it starts working.
[09:41] <pixie_dust> theres the xorg one which is lame and slow, and theres the 2 fglrx propiety, and one with updates.
[09:41] <pixie_dust> ok ill try that
[09:41] <Guido1> Ben64: my home folder
[09:42] <Ben64> Guido1: then it wouldn't be /home/Lahannya-Dystopia.m3u
[09:42] <theadmin> Ben64: Use $HOME or ~ to refer to your home folder from the terminal
[09:42] <pixie_dust> currently i keep getting a compiz has had a critical error, close/relaunch, will this fix that?
[09:43] <theadmin> pixie_dust: Maybe. Not too sure.
[09:43] <theadmin> I'm with nvidia nowadays, no problems at all :)
[09:43] <Ben64> theadmin: I know, but Guido1 was doing this -  "play-uri=file:home/Lahannya-Dystopia.m3u"
[09:43] <theadmin> Ben64: Oh, bah, sorry wrong person
[09:43] <theadmin> Guido1: Use $HOME or ~ to refer to your home folder from the terminal
[09:43] <MasterOfDisaster> phrozen: are you sure your files didn't get messed up somehow? encoding trouble, dos vs. unix line endings, etc.?
[09:43] <pixie_dust> ummm
[09:44] <pixie_dust> i cant use the d key on my desktop
[09:44] <pixie_dust> so i cant type sudo
[09:44] <pixie_dust> usually i find a d and ctrl + c it
[09:44] <MasterOfDisaster> phrozen: try running it from the shell in your python interpreter, it should be at least able to read it.
[09:44] <Guido1> theadmin: so it would be play-uri=file:~/Lahannya-Dystopia.m3u"?
[09:45] <phrozen> MasterOfDisaster: and it is.
[09:45] <Ben64> pixie_dust: ctrl+shift+u+64
[09:46] <Ben64> pixie_dust: but seriously, buy a new keyboard, they aren't expensive
[09:47] <Tex_Nick> theadmin : regarding nvidia ... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpOyKCNZYw ...; @^@
[09:47] <theadmin> Ben64: Thanks, that's the code I was looking for :D
[09:47] <pixie_dust> lol thank you, it only just broke yesterday

[09:48] <pixie_dust> :(
[09:48] <phrozen> MasterOfDisaster: Thank you.
[09:48] <mahesh_> can any one please help me to resolve an issue with packages? I am not able to install any thing by apt-get command in kubuntu 12.04 LTS. I am getting error as : "E: Unmet dependencies. Try 'apt-get -f install' with no packages (or specify a solution)."
[09:49] <pixie_dust> can anyone help me with an ati driver issue
[09:49] <dr_willis> and you did try 'sudo apt-get -f'  mahesh_ ?
[09:49] <Tex_Nick> theadmin : link is what linus torvalds thinks about nvidia :-)
[09:49] <mahesh_> yes, but it didn't work
[09:50] <pixie_dust> i guess ill try the ati drivers from the website.. nothing else i can do
[09:50] <Guido1> Ben64, theadmin: still a bit stuck
[09:50] <theadmin> Tex_Nick: Well, don't care much what Linus thinks. It works for me :P
[09:51] <Ben64> Guido1: you should try making a script to do what you want, then have crontab call it
[09:51] <theadmin> Tex_Nick: Then again this is a Dell computer, sooo...
[09:52] <Guido1> Ben64: how do i make such a script, where do i have to save it etc?
[09:52] <theadmin> mahesh_: Try running "sudo apt-get update" first.
[09:52] <theadmin> Guido1: Doesn't matter at all. Just make a file starting with "#!/bin/bash", followed by all your commands, one per line.
[09:52] <pixie_dust> what does sudo apt-get update do?
[09:53] <theadmin> pixie_dust: Gets the package lists.
[09:53] <pixie_dust> oh
[09:53] <Guido1> Ben64: if i could do it with parole it would also be fine; how do i know tthe right coments?
[09:53] <Tex_Nick> theadmin : i use nvidia on several boxs also ... works for me too ... was just injecting some humor ;_)
[09:54] <Ben64> Guido1: look at what theadmin said.
[09:54] <mahesh_> Ok, trying now...:)
[09:54] <Guido1> i'm trying to make a alarmclock since the timer of my musicenter is broken :-S
[09:54] <belgianguy> ah, thanks MasterOfDisaster, I'll just continue onwards then configuring it
[09:54] <Guido1> Ben64: i'm trying to make a alarmclock since the timer of my musicenter is broken :-S
[09:54] <Ben64> Guido1: you might want to look into "at" then

[09:55] <Guido1> Ben64: how do i look into that?
[09:56] <kdns> Please, can anyone well me the correct two ways (sysvinit and upstart) to set a service to start manually or automatically?
[09:56] <Ben64> Guido1: the manual for at, google
[09:56] <Ben64> !upstart | kdns
[09:56] <ubottu> kdns: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[09:57] <kdns> Thanks Ben, I know what upstart is and what sysvinit is, I just can't find an authoritative "correct" way to do this for ubuntu precise
[09:57] <kdns> just a million different answers when I google.
[09:57] <Ben64> check the link from ubottu
[09:59] <theadmin> Guido1: Uh, well, something like "30 6 * * MON-FRI mplayer '/home/l/Music/alarm.mp3' &" will give you an alarm at 6:30 AM, monday to friday.
[09:59] <theadmin> Guido1: Shouldn't be a problem.

[10:00] <Guido1> parole and rhythmbox
[10:00] <Ben64> mplayer is quite easy to install
[10:01] <theadmin> Guido1: ...Won't work from crontab, they are graphical
[10:01] <niners> hello... I just did an automatic update and something happened with my wine and there was an error and it's like I no longer have it. can someone please help me
[10:01] <theadmin> Guido1: You need a command-line player, so just "sudo apt-get install mplayer".
[10:01] <Styler2go> hello guys. i am having some problems starting my apache2,, it tells me: bad group name"psacln"
[10:01] <theadmin> Guido1: The syntax for playlists is identical to that above, just use ".m3u" instead of ".mp3" :P
[10:02] <dr_willis> niners:  start with   wine --version    perhaps from a terminal to see if its installed
[10:02] <Guido1> theadmin: okee, then i will try that
[10:02] <Ben64> Styler2go: what os, what control panel, how did you install apache?
[10:02] <kdns> Ben64: Yeh, that's what I looked at, and I don't see where it answers my questions.
[10:03] <nooob> hey guys i am writing a test, pls help me - how to find out if a domain uses a virtual host?
[10:03] <Styler2go> ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Plesk, apache was installed, i coppied my old backup into and it stopped working
[10:03] <nooob> for example www.wikipedia.org
[10:03] <Ben64> kdns: you didn't read all of that in 2 minutes
[10:03] <Styler2go> (after a reboot)
[10:03] <pixie_dust> when i try to install the graphics drivers it says that some kernal headers cannot be found
[10:03] <kdns> Ben no, I read it before I came in here asking questions.
[10:03] <dr_willis> !headers
[10:03] <ubottu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages

[10:03] <Ben64> pixie_dust: 64 bit?
[10:04] <nooob> can anyone help me please? which command do I use?
[10:04] <pixie_dust> yeah
[10:04] <niners> but I dont have an entire wine installation. I installed a collection of packages one of which goes with wine.  Sole purpose was to get netflix to work on this os.
[10:04] <niners> Dr. Willis I meant
[10:04] <Ben64> pixie_dust: sudo apt-get install linux-headers`uname -r | sed s/^.*[0-9]\-/-/g`
[10:05] <pixie_dust> O_o
[10:05] <theadmin> nooob: You can't find that out, you need their server config..
[10:05] <pixie_dust> sudo apt get *raindance*
[10:05] <kdns> Ben64: I searched through it using search terms I gathered when I got the thousand other mixed responses
[10:05] <dr_willis> niners:  that netflix ppa thing - installs its own special wine  and firefox.
[10:05] <mahesh_> @<theadmin> : same issue after update
[10:05] <nooob> theadmin: okay, that really sucks..... I have to find out :/
[10:05] <niners> dr willis... yeah?
[10:05] <dr_willis> yes...
[10:05] <Styler2go> How could i reinstall apache2?
[10:05] <kdns> Ben64: You seem to think I want to learn about upstart. I actually don't right now. definitely later, but right now, I want to get my computer working.
[10:06] <Styler2go> apt-get remove and then install or is there a command to reinstall?
[10:06] <niners> so... I dont see what you're getting at dr
[10:06] <mahesh_> mahesh@Mahesh-System-Kubuntu:~$ sudo apt-get install gedit
[10:06] <mahesh_> Reading package lists... Done
[10:06] <mahesh_> Building dependency tree
[10:06] <mahesh_> Reading state information... Done
[10:06] <mahesh_> You might want to run 'apt-get -f install' to correct these:
[10:06] <FloodBot1> mahesh_: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[10:06] <mahesh_> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[10:06] <Ben64> Styler2go: we can't really help you with plesk
[10:06] <theadmin> Styler2go: sudo apt-get --reinstall install apache2
[10:06] <dr_willis> apt has a reinstall option
[10:06] <nooob> theadmin: so should write there that virtual hosts cannot be found?
[10:06] <nooob> theadmin: but that would be weird...
[10:06] <theadmin> nooob: I suppose... How would you find  that out? That's private information anyway. And if it's your server you could access it...
[10:07] <kdns> Ben64: I came in here because I did the searching and reading docs and forum posts and sifting through different years' and different versions' correct ways, and I came up blank, and I'm hoping someone can give me an answer.
[10:07] <Styler2go> and: what can i do against this message? /bin/sh: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
[10:07] <niners> Dr. Willis? You talking to me? I cant really tell
[10:07] <nooob> theadmin: well, I have to find out virtual servers for www.archlinux.org and www.wikipedia.org
[10:07] <nooob> theadmin: but that task is pointless then
[10:07] <Ben64> nooob: not really an ubuntu question
[10:07] <nooob> i know :D
[10:07] <Ben64> then.... not in this channel
[10:08] <dr_willis> niners:   check that netflix things repository  and see what all it installs using synaptic. it pulls in quiet a bit of stuff.
[10:08] <pixie_dust> xBen64 it said the optopn r fro  -r is not known
[10:08] <niners> dr willis.... oaky then what
[10:08] <Ben64> pixie_dust: you have to type it in exactly as i had it
[10:08] <pixie_dust> i did
[10:08] <Ben64> no you didn't
[10:08] <Tex_Nick> Styler2go :  you might also ask in #httpd & #ubuntu-server
[10:09] <kdns> Ben64: If you know the answer, if you could just tell me, that would be nice. if you don't, you could just tell me you don't, or not answer. I don't need to be told RTFM, I have the discipline to do that myself, I just lack the time right now.
[10:09] <Styler2go> but whats with this problem? /bin/sh: warning: setlocale: LC_ALL: cannot change locale (en_US.UTF-8)
[10:09] <nooob> okay then, i hope that theadmins answer is right... thx
[10:09] <dr_willis> niners:  Im not clear on what the original problem is
[10:09] <theadmin> kdns: Sorry, uh, what's your problem again?
[10:10] <theadmin> Styler2go: Might need to generate that locale... sudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8 && sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
[10:10] <kdns> Please, can anyone well me the correct two ways (sysvinit and upstart) to set a service to start manually or automatically?
[10:10] <Styler2go> thank you so much <3 :)
[10:10] <Styler2go> i will try to fix apache on my own.. :)
[10:10] <dr_willis> kdns:  upstart services have a config file in /etc/init/*.conf  that start them at bootup.
[10:11] <Pangolin> pixie_dust: There's a virtual keyboard in the Accessibility tools
[10:11] <mahesh_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1585157/
[10:11] <Pangolin> but it's only useful in virtual terminals
[10:11] <pixie_dust> argh
[10:11] <kdns> I know various ways to do it... but I want to know the *RIGHT* way.
[10:11] <theadmin> kdns: For upstart, in the .conf file, "manual" anywhere in the file on a separate line for manual startup, or "start on runlevel [2345]" for automatic. I'm not too familiar with SysVInit, though.
[10:12] <kdns> dr_willis: so the .override file is the right way then?
[10:12] <dr_willis> overfide file can turn it OFF - disable it...
[10:12] <dr_willis> the upstart cookbook web site - details 3 ways to disable a service i recall
[10:12] <kdns> hah, it ain't working then. Stops one of these two services from starting auto, but doesn't stop it altogether.
[10:13] <kdns> exactly - three ways. which one is the *right* way.
[10:13] <dr_willis> there is no right way. it depends on your needs
[10:13] <Styler2go> how can i COMPLETLY remove apache2? apt-get remove apache2 ; is this enough?
[10:13] <dr_willis> you asked how to start them..
[10:13] <Styler2go> or should i ask in another channel?
[10:13] <dr_willis> Styler2go:  i belive theres some apache2 settings packages also
[10:13] <cfhowlett> Styler2go, sudo apt-get purge apache2*
[10:13] <kdns> Why would programmers allow three ways to do it without purpose for three ways?
[10:13] <Ben64> Styler2go: purge, but with plesk, anything we suggest may not work
[10:13] <kdns> I doubt that...
[10:13] <niners> the wine package that came with the collection is saying that it is unable to properly operate as it's looking for 1.14.12ubuntu3 which was a part of the older version of the os
[10:13] <dr_willis> kdns:  the override method does NOT work for older ubuntu releases..
[10:14] <kdns> Right, this is precise
[10:14] <dr_willis> kdns:  theres also future features of upstart documented that are not in the current release ofupstart
[10:14] <niners> dr_willis: the wine package that came with the collection is saying that it is unable to properly operate as it's looking for 1.14.12ubuntu3 which was a part of the older version of the os
[10:14] <dr_willis> i just rename the whatever.conf file if i want to disable a  upstart service.
[10:14] <theadmin> kdns: Please see my answer. There's no "right" way to do it if there are multiple ways, Tim Toady. But the easiest is probably what I described.
[10:15] <Guido1> theadmin, Ben64: for some reason "14 11 * * MON-FRI mplayer '/home/alarm.m3u' &" doesn't work and how do i stop the alarm?
[10:15] <dr_willis> niners:  i updated that netflix stuff today. here on 12.10  - havent tried it yet.
[10:15] <Mrokii> Hello. Is there a logout command I can use from a TTY to break out of a failing log-in process?
[10:15] <theadmin> Guido1: /home is NOT your home directory.
[10:15] <theadmin> Guido1: it's /home/username/
[10:15] <Ben64> also, i would use "at" for an alarm, not cron
=== matthew is now known as Guest36623
[10:15] <niners> Dr. Willis: I have 12.04
[10:15] <kdns> I disagree. Many ways to do it does not automatically imply that they are all equally correct.
[10:16] <dr_willis> niners:  and i am on  12.10 - so thats about all i can offer
[10:16] <Guido1> theadmin: okee and how do is stop the alarm?
[10:16] <niners> Dr. Willis... so what should I do exactly
[10:16] <niners> just get windows?
[10:16] <theadmin> Guido1: Uh... killall mplayer
[10:16] <kdns> The *right* way may have a bunch of dependencies on your situation or whatever...
[10:16] <Styler2go> lol its running...
[10:17] <theadmin> Guido1: Also, uh, the line should be without quotes in the crontab, is that so?
[10:17] <theadmin> Guido1: i.e., just: 14 11 * * MON-FRI mplayer '/home/alarm.m3u' &
[10:17] <Guido1> theadmin: yes
[10:17] <theadmin> Guido1: Well, more of: 14 11 * * MON-FRI mplayer '/home/guido1/alarm.m3u' &
[10:18] <theadmin> Guido1: That will play at 11:14, monday to friday.
[10:18] <kdns> I really appreciate the help guys but I don't think anyone here actually knows best practice for having these two tools behave as desired... Any idea where to find out?
[10:18] <Ben64> Guido1, theadmin: probably need a -playlist after mplayer
[10:18] <theadmin> Ben64: Huh, thought it'd work that way.
[10:18] <theadmin> Ben64: I don't know, I don't do playlists, I do folders.
[10:18] <theadmin> lol
[10:18] <Ben64> me too
[10:18] <Ben64> mplayer Music/*
[10:19] <niners> Dr. Willis?
[10:19] <dr_willis> kdns:  you may want to clarify the question and post it on askubuntu.com - its not really clear on what you are asking.
[10:19] <Guido1> theadmin: how do you do folders?
[10:19] <dr_willis> niners: ?
[10:19] <kdns> I'm sorry I wasn't clear
[10:19] <niners> Dr Willis... So what is it you suggest i do exactly
[10:19] <theadmin> Guido1: Just dump a bunch of files in a folder and play the folder
[10:20] <dr_willis> niners:  no idea. Im not on the same release as you. You just said its missing some package. so sounds like the ppa maintainer has some issues.
[10:20] <kostkon> Guido1, for a simpler solution, check this: https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/applications/alarm-clock-applet/
[10:20] <Guido1> theadmin: but what is the coment?
[10:20] <Ben64> Guido1: just curious, why not use one of the alarm applications available?
[10:20] <kdns> It's actually four questions
[10:20] <theadmin> Guido1: ?
[10:21] <niners> the wine package that came with the collection is saying that it is unable to properly operate as it's looking for 1.14.12ubuntu3 which was a part of the older version of the os
[10:21] <theadmin> Ben64: And why do use them? I mean, installing extra stuff when there's an excellent built-in scheduler is just bloating your system
[10:21] <Tex_Nick> !best | kdns
[10:21] <ubottu> kdns: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[10:21] <Guido1> Ben64, theadmin: course i couldn't find one suporting playlists, Cd or folder
[10:21] <dr_willis> looking for what exactly niners ? you jus gave a version #... not a package name
[10:21] <kdns> What is the best practice to set an upstart service to start manually only? What is the best practice to set an sysvinit service to start manually only? What is the best practice to set an upstart service to start automatically? What is the best practice to set an upstart service to start automatically?
[10:21] <pixie_dust> i did that command you said but i get the same error
[10:21] <Ben64> theadmin: well i have an alarm clock for alarming
[10:21] <theadmin> Guido1: Well mplayer supports all of those :P
[10:21] <Styler2go> E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)  what does that mean?
[10:22] <Ben64> Styler2go: something had a problem
[10:22] <kdns> Tex, I am not asking what app is best. I am asking for the best practice for the tools. Instructions, not opinions.
[10:22] <theadmin> Styler2go: That means something went wonky when you were doing stuff to packages. Can't tell what without the actual error (should be above that)
[10:22] <kdns> Tex_Nick:

[10:25] <Styler2go> yeah, but how to reinstall.. lets look...wait :D

[10:26] <pixie_dust> im trying to install ati drivers and it says im missing kernal headers
[10:27] <Ben64> pixie_dust: i've already told  you how to install headers
[10:27] <dr_willis> !headers
[10:27] <ubottu> To install the Linux (kernel) headers, open a terminal and: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) To install headers for libraries, you need the accompanying -dev packages
[10:27] <pixie_dust> i tryed it didnt work..
[10:27] <Ben64> you did not type it correctly
[10:27] <dr_willis> then you could have said so. ;)
[10:27] <antonio_> neither of my pdf viewers will stay open...how can I diagnose the problem?
[10:27] <Ben64> sudo apt-get install linux-headers`uname -r | sed s/^.*[0-9]\-/-/g`
[10:27] <Ben64> works perfectly
[10:28] <Styler2go> i just can reinstall it... nothing about install without plesk or so...
[10:28] <Guido1> theadmin: and the comand for playing audio CD (audio traks on it, no mp3)
[10:30] <theadmin> Guido1: To play an audio CD you can use mplayer /dev/dvd
[10:30] <theadmin> Guido1: And to pause you can use killall -STOP mplayer (to continue, killall -CONT mplayer)
[10:31] <Styler2go> ok i am installing it without plesk... plesk is nice because it has an app for controlling cpu / ram usage...
[10:31] <theadmin> Probably the wrong way to do it but I don't want to bother reading the docs for the commands :P
[10:31] <Styler2go> that was the only reason i used it.. :D
[10:32] <pixie_dust> wooo
[10:32] <pixie_dust> thank you ben
[10:32] <pixie_dust> i was pressing ' instead of `

[11:09] <bitch-slapper> TomyLaptop the windows key on the keyboard
[11:09] <histo> TomyLaptop: windows key is super

[11:10] <TomyLaptop> no, windows isnt super :D
[11:10] <july_> cockroacher: no, the possibility are create a folder, create a new document, align the icons... but not create a launcher.
[11:10] <histo> makara: ctlr+r
[11:10] <TomyLaptop> i thought that key was called meta
[11:10] <bitch-slapper> ok july
[11:11] <histo> TomyLaptop: I've heard it refered to both ways.
[11:11] <TomyLaptop> KDE calls it meta. i just checked
[11:11] <bitch-slapper> TomyLaptop no patents yet if im correct
[11:12] <makara> elliria, histo Thankyou
[11:12] <elliria> makara: Any time. (:
[11:12] <belgianguy> it's not the " or ' either, it crashes on both
[11:13] <TomyLaptop> ok there is libboost1.48-dbg which depends on libboost1.48-dev, but no libboost1.48
[11:13] <TomyLaptop> what the heck?
[11:13] <TomyLaptop> isnt it usually the way that both -dbg and -dev depend on the main package?

[11:15] <yann2> hello! I m looking to speak to the guy who does laptop certifications for canonical, anyone know who that might be?
[11:15] <akis> My 12,04 system recognizes my camera and lsusb gives: Bus 004 Device 004: ID 0553:0002 STMicroelectronics Imaging Division (VLSI Vision) CPiA Webcam. Why adobe cannot recognize this cam and any webcamtest fails?
[11:15] <bitch-slapper> akis install cheese and check
[11:15] <belgianguy> akis: tried cheese or mplayer or vlc?
[11:16] <histo> yann2: You'd probably have to talk with canonical support and ask them would be a start.
=== Guest77201 is now known as Guest77
[11:16] <yann2> histo, that'd be assuming I have support?
[11:16] <histo> yann2: That's how cannonical makes money
[11:17] <akis> belgianguy. the cam works with vlc
[11:17] <TomyLaptop> i guess he wants to pay for the cert but not for support
[11:17] <yann2> just want to report that one of their certificated hardware doesnt work, thought it might interest them even if I m not supported
[11:17] <histo> yann2: http://www.ubuntu.com/support
[11:17] <TomyLaptop> oh or that
[11:17] <yann2> If I was supported and they told me to go for it I d probably be quite upset
[11:18] <histo> yann2: What hardware are your referring to and why do you think its' certified?
[11:18] <histo> yann2: http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/
[11:18] <yann2> T430s, http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/201202-10634/  , and actually I might still have a support contract
[11:18] <yann2> it sa  personal one though, and this is my work laptop
[11:19] <belgianguy> akis: well that's good, but wouldn't know how to continue from there
[11:19] <belgianguy> akis: xawtv might be able to help
[11:19] <histo> yann2: What problem are you experiencing?
[11:20] <yann2> random freeze - searching for "t430s ubuntu freeze" seems I m not alone
[11:20] <akis> belgianguy. i want adobe to be able to see the webcam. why cannot access it althougt the system can recognise the devise?
[11:20] <histo> yann2: what version of ubuntu are you running?
[11:20] <yann2> 12.4 LTS
[11:20] <belgianguy> akis: codecs I guess

[11:23] <yann2> seems unresolved
[11:23] <yann2> but with kernel patches
[11:24] <histo> yann2: Okay so have you installed kernel patches?
[11:25] <yann2> at the moment, I just wanted to notify the certification guy of the issues
[11:25] <yann2> regarding patches, recompiling a kernel is not a small task
[11:25] <yann2> (and maintaining it)
[11:26] <yann2> did I say something wrong? you seem quite hostile
[11:26] <histo> yann2: on the certification page there is a link for more info and the procedure for becoming certified. I'm sure those  would be the same people.
[11:26] <akis> bitch-slapper. no.if vlc can connect the cam what do i get more with cheese?
[11:26] <histo> yann2: No i'm not being hostile just trying to help. Sorry it's coming off that way.
[11:27] <yann2> I' ll get support and get it fixed this way.
[11:27] <yann2> from my previous experience I m not that hopeful though.

[11:32] <bitch-slapper> lolh4rd no substitute for fast connection
[11:33] <l0lh4rd> I m gonna but still the present connection which I m using is much more faster in Windows than in Linux(xubuntu)
[11:33] <bitch-slapper> what you using cable or 3g???
[11:33] <l0lh4rd> DSL
[11:33] <l0lh4rd> cable
[11:33] <erupter> l0lh4rd, my connections usually perform the same (if not faster) under ubuntu
[11:34] <erupter> l0lh4rd, what is the reating of the line you're talking about?
[11:34] <erupter> *rating
[11:34] <MonkeyDust> l0lh4rd  picked this up in this channel http://paste.ubuntu.com/1585659/
[11:34] <bitch-slapper> it should be fast but not like installing Downoad Accelerator etc
[11:35] <erupter> bitch-slapper, does it really give you any advantage nowadays???
[11:35] <l0lh4rd> rating?
[11:35] <bitch-slapper> on windows yes you can see the increase not sure on linux how
[11:35] <erupter> bitch-slapper, with multi-mega-bit lines, I don't see the point in compressing the stream... unless we're talking fullhd :p
[11:35] <erupter> l0lh4rd, yeah rating: megabits
[11:36] <l0lh4rd> 256Kbps -_-
[11:36] <erupter> uh
[11:36] <l0lh4rd> :(
[11:36] <bitch-slapper> erupter correct but windies works diff from linux
[11:36] <bitch-slapper> so thats 30KBps effective l0lh4rd
[11:36] <erupter> l0lh4rd, so you can't get 25K/s out of your line?
[11:36] <erupter> bitch-slapper, I usually divide by 10 to allow for overheads :)
[11:37] <l0lh4rd> yes

[11:38] <mad-monkey> yes line is sloww...
[11:38] <erupter> l0lh4rd, yes it's all flash based, quite heavy on such a slow line
[11:40] <MonkeyDust> ironically, you need to have a fast pc to know how fast your pc is
[11:40] <MonkeyDust> or fast line
[11:41] <l0lh4rd> Core i3, 4GB RAM
[11:41] <mad-monkey> MonkeDust not really networking is independent
[11:41] <mad-monkey> very very powerful l0lh4rd
[11:44] <l0lh4rd> anyways thanks for the tips
[11:45] <l0lh4rd> I have no other choice then to upgrade my plan
[11:45] <mad-monkey> yes sir
[11:47] <l0lh4rd> btw, there's only slight difference between ubuntu and xubuntu right?
[11:47] <erupter> l0lh4rd, unfortunately given that any newspaper homepage is going to weight in the multi-megabytes range, you are in a situation similar to the latest machines equipped with floppy disks: they could go much faster and host much more data, still they were limited by the awfully slow and small floppy
[11:47] <erupter> l0lh4rd, not much, just aesthetics
[11:47] <l0lh4rd> thanks erupter
[11:48] <erupter> l0lh4rd, what changes is the UI the OS presents, you can also change it yourself should you want to
[11:48] <erupter> l0lh4rd, xubuntu uses XDE, ubuntu uses Unity
[11:48] <erupter> l0lh4rd, you can still install any on any distro
[11:48] <erupter> l0lh4rd, in your case something along the lines of $sudo apt-get install unity
[11:48] <auronandace> erupter: xubuntu uses xfce
[11:48] <erupter> or
[11:49] <erupter> auronandace, yeah right, it's kubuntu that uses kde :p
[11:49] <erupter> l0lh4rd, to install the usual unity desktop you'd do $sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[11:49] <MonkeyDust> http://i.imgur.com/3N5f6.jpg  <-- different DE's
[11:49] <erupter> l0lh4rd, that would install everything you need, and then at the start you can choose to load unity or xfce
[11:50] <l0lh4rd> thanks
[11:50] <erupter> l0lh4rd, you can do the same for KDE or any other interface

[11:52] <ThinkT510> erupter: unity is build on top of gnome3
[11:52] <Reddictor_> gnome3 's gk3 is used in unity so only DE gnome-shell is dumped

[11:53] <erupter> l0lh4rd, yeah it's a lot of megs :(
[11:53] <MonkeyDust> unity is a shell over gnome3
[11:53] <Reddictor_> correct

[12:42] <bharath> how to add quantal repo to 12.04? for libnl update version
[12:43] <ActionParsnip> bharath: that will make a big mes
[12:43] <jrib> bharath: mixing repositories for other ubuntu versions is not supported
[12:43] <Styler2go> ubuntu was pre installed
[12:43] <ActionParsnip> bharath: I suggest you find a ppa
[12:43] <jrib> Styler2go: by whom?
[12:43] <Styler2go> i just copied my backuo over the files after i was done installing everything :-/
[12:43] <Styler2go> its a vServer
[12:43] <justmeh> bharath,
[12:43] <justmeh> it can be done
[12:43] <justmeh> what you are looking for is called pinning.
[12:43] <justmeh> !pinning
[12:44] <justmeh> !apt-pin
[12:44] <justmeh> !apt-pining
[12:44] <FloodBot1> justmeh: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[12:44] <Styler2go> :D :D
[12:44] <justmeh> shush u stupid bot
[12:44] <jrib> Styler2go: you should complain to whoever is managing the server as it's very strange for you to not have awk and there's likely to be more things broken
[12:44] <justmeh> however bharath in general its VERY STRONGLY recommended to nOT do this
[12:44] <ActionParsnip> its not pinning, bharath wants a later version than is in Precise
[12:44] <justmeh> yes
[12:44] <Styler2go> how can i "clean up" my apt-get ?
[12:44] <justmeh> pinning ActionParsnip
[12:44] <Styler2go> it tells me many strange things
[12:44] <bharath> ActionParsnip, while building gnome-shell using jhbuild I got this error  http://pastie.org/5929206
[12:44] <justmeh> http://jaqque.sbih.org/kplug/apt-pinning.html
[12:44] <justmeh> basically
[12:44] <ActionParsnip> Styler2go: sudo apt-get clean     will remove the old debs from the cache, freeing up space
[12:45] <justmeh> you leave your current repos in your apt
[12:45] <jrib> Styler2go: I suggest you reinstall
[12:45] <ActionParsnip> justmeh: its not pinning
[12:45] <justmeh> it is pinning
[12:45] <justmeh> then you add more repos
[12:45] <RB> does anyone know how I can detect the state of my display? I want to start and close a program as the display is turned on and off
[12:45] <justmeh> then you select which is the preferred
[12:45] <justmeh> so
[12:45] <Styler2go> cant i just install awk?
[12:45] <ActionParsnip> justmeh: how is wanting the version of a later release in an older release pinning?
[12:45] <justmeh> ActionParsnip, stfu and read the link lol
[12:45] <ActionParsnip> justmeh: but the version desired isn't in the repo for Precise
[12:45] <justmeh> what happens is you go to install xyz and it will prefer WHICHEVER repo you specified when you pin
[12:46] <jrib> Styler2go: yes. However, like I said, there are likely other things wrong.  Also, it's very strange for the mysql package to even be successfully installed when awk isn't there
[12:46] <ActionParsnip> justmeh: user wants the version from Quantal to be in Precise
[12:46]  * justmeh sighs
[12:46] <justmeh> ActionParsnip, please
[12:46] <justmeh> please shush and let me finish
[12:46] <justmeh> right.
[12:46] <MrSassyPants> recommend me a really slim wm

[12:47] <ActionParsnip> thanks
[12:47] <justmeh> jeez
[12:47] <justmeh> now then.
[12:47] <justmeh> once the quantal sources are in your apt sources
[12:48] <jrib> justmeh: we know what pinning is.
[12:48] <justmeh> AND you have specified the pinning, it should first look in your default repo
[12:48] <ayman> how to update lib-c6 to 12.3  +  on ubuntu lucid ??
[12:48] <justmeh> now, for a specific package such as this, you can specify which of your repo sets you want to pull from
[12:48] <jrib> justmeh: please stop.
[12:48] <IdleOne> justmeh: You are wrong on two counts. Mixing repos is not recommended or supported, your attitude towards other users needs to change to reflect the !guidelines you were linked.
[12:48] <justmeh> lulz
[12:48] <justmeh> first
[12:48] <justmeh> i said it wasnt suggested
[12:48] <MonkeyDust> high spirits today...
[12:48] <justmeh> second it is doable
[12:49] <justmeh> third that's what ubuntu is - a mix of debian that's been pushed a bit and twisted here and there
[12:49] <Styler2go> so i shoudl reinstall the server?
[12:49] <ayman> how to update lib-c6 to 12.3  +  on ubuntu lucid ? any help here
[12:49] <justmeh> and fourth it can be done.
[12:49] <Styler2go> no other way?
[12:49] <IdleOne> !wfm
[12:49] <ubottu> Common Sense: Just because you can, does not mean you should (and especially recommend to others). Think before you do. "Works for me" does not mean it is ok. The latest version of everything is not always useful if you aim for stability. Please see http://geekosophical.net/random/worksforme/
[12:49] <justmeh> finally, when you actually pull the package in this way it may bring in other stuff. which is where the acutal danger is. it often breaks stuff
=== TomyLaptop is now known as TomyLobo
[12:49] <justmeh> you would have got that line minutes ago but....
[12:49] <jrib> Styler2go: of course there's another way.  But you don't know why it's broken.  So I suggest you reinstall fresh so you know what you are dealing with
[12:50] <justmeh> so anyway it might be easier to compile from source if you really need that one package
[12:50] <bharath> ActionParsnip, how can I update libnl 3.2.3 to 3.2.7?
[12:50] <Styler2go> i sent u the log... doesnt that help you? :-/
[12:50] <justmeh> but your going to have to track down all the requireds
[12:50] <jrib> Styler2go: no because you can't tell me why it is that way.  I suspect you just have a broken install
[12:50] <Styler2go> ah, fuck off, i will jst reinstall it...
[12:51] <justmeh> and that is the CORRECT and full answer.
[12:51] <Styler2go> so i have to wait again...
[12:51] <jrib> Styler2go: please mind your language here
[12:51] <justmeh> Styler2go, whats your issue
[12:51] <Styler2go> i am sorry ...
[12:51] <IdleOne> justmeh: You have proved your point. You know a lot about how stuff in debian distros work. Now please learn the Ubuntu way of doing things if you wish to continue supporting users in here.
[12:51] <justmeh> dont just reinstall willy nilly.. its good to try to fix things. thats where the learning comes in
[12:51] <justmeh> IdleOne, please read all that i said
[12:52] <ayman> how to update lib-c6 to 12.3  +  on ubuntu lucid ? any help here
[12:52] <justmeh> minus the telling ActionParsnip to well shush excessively
[12:52] <justmeh> i was right on all points
[12:52] <justmeh> and
[12:52] <Rin> ...
[12:52] <jrib> justmeh: stop pressing enter so much
[12:52] <IdleOne> I did. You are wrong for even suggesting to do something that will break his system
[12:52] <MonkeyDust> justmeh  know when to stop
[12:52] <Rin> as a manager i'd send you home
[12:52] <justmeh> we could have a discussion about supported vs allowed vs possible
[12:52] <ayman> <justmeh> how to update lib-c6 to 12.3 +  on ubuntu lucid  ??
[12:53] <justmeh> but the idea behind helping someone is to not just force them into your method, but to teach why
[12:53] <IdleOne> justmeh: The idea behind supporting in #ubuntu is to do it the ubuntu way. Now please drop it.
[12:53] <justmeh> don't pm me
[12:54] <justmeh> IdleOne, do you have an issue with the truth?
[12:54] <ayman> any help here
[12:54] <Rin> consistency. there are plenty of ways to do things, not all are correct
[12:54] <ikonia> ayman: you don't do that
[12:54] <justmeh> because, since ubuntu came from debian, and pinning is supported, and its there in ubuntu, and its supported.. its just not wise or recommended most of the time.
[12:54] <ikonia> ayman: you use the libraries provided by the packages in the official ubuntu repo that match your version
[12:54] <IdleOne> justmeh: this isn't a debate. drop it please. You are right in saying that it could be done. You are wrong in saying it in this channel. that is it.

[12:57] <bipul> http://pastebin.com/BFZhMtrV Any one who can help me in this problem.
[12:57] <andybrine> Just a quick question
[12:57] <jrib> Styler2go: so you have awk now?
[12:57] <aeon-ltd> justmeh: don't you mean upgrade version xyz to xzy2? if you want newer packages compile or use a ppa
[12:57] <andybrine> I have just updated my ram on my laptop and its not showing up in "About this computer"
[12:58] <ActionParsnip> bharath: there may be a PPA with the newer version

[12:58] <andybrine> should this show up after a reboot
[12:58] <andybrine> ?
[12:58] <justmeh> aeon-ltd, sure. and agreed. however sometimes you gotta pull in sections of stuff. anyway droppd
[12:58] <aeon-ltd> andybrine: does 'free -m' in a terminal show the larger size
[12:58] <jrib> andybrine: does it show up in bios?
[12:58] <Styler2go> how can i try, jirido?
[12:59] <Styler2go> yes i have
[12:59] <andybrine> good point, i show check the bios

[13:13] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[13:18] <wdl> hi
[13:21] <ActionParsnip> hi wdl
[13:21] <wdl> hi
[13:23] <aeon-ltd> it's weird that support happens in clusters and the channel always experiences 5-10 minutes of silence every few hours
[13:24] <ActionParsnip> aeon-ltd: it means things are working :)
[13:25] <cfhowlett> ActionParsnip, true indeed.
[13:26] <MonkeyDust> aeon-ltd  may be timezone-related
[13:27] <cristian_c> Hi
[13:27] <usr13> or, no-one-broke-anything
[13:27] <cfhowlett> cristian_c, greetings
[13:27] <cristian_c> I've found that I can send commands to my irc client from a configuration file: perform.conf
[13:27] <cristian_c> for example: cmd = /join #ubuntu
[13:27] <cristian_c> I could launch a script in the same manner: cmd = /exec -o ~/scriptname
[13:28] <cristian_c> I'd like to use this tecnique for use a personal quit message in irc
[13:28] <cristian_c> How can I do to get this?
[13:28] <usr13> cristian_c: irssi?
[13:29] <cristian_c> usr13, no
[13:29] <MonkeyDust> cristian_c  try /quit [your personal message here]
[13:29] <cristian_c> Monkeyok, but in this manner, I exit now
[13:29] <cristian_c> Monkeyok, i'd like to use this quit message when I'll quit
[13:30] <MonkeyDust> cristian_c  whar IRC client?
[13:30] <cristian_c> *MonkeyDust
[13:30] <MonkeyDust> wht*
[13:30] <cristian_c> MonkeyDust, lostirc
[13:31] <Jun> How to create a launcher on the Desktop? When I use Ctrl+super+right click, only create a new folder oer create a document empty document appear, but no launcher.
[13:32] <ActionParsnip> Jun: you use .desktop files. The only way I know how is to copy one from~/.config/autostart   then modify
[13:33] <cristian_c> Any ideas?
[13:33] <Jun> Hi ActionParsnip. Where are .desktop files?
[13:33] <ActionParsnip> cristian_c: does your irc client have a support channel of its own?
[13:34] <ActionParsnip> Jun: in ~/.config/autostart   if you want one of an installed app, you can simply copy the relevant one from /usr/share/applications to the desktop
[13:34] <kostkon> Jun, check also in ~./local/share/applications. put your own custom .desktop files in there too
[13:34] <MonkeyDust> cristian_c  type /set to know the right setting, i guess, or use a more common client to get better support
[13:35] <cristian_c> ah, ok
[13:35] <Jun> In fact, I want the execute a script in a terminal
[13:35] <cristian_c> MonkeyDust, lostirc is a lightweight irc client
[13:36] <usr13> cristian_c: If you want more features, try irssi
[13:36] <kostkon> Jun, and you want to create a desktop file for it?
[13:36] <MonkeyDust> cristian_c  yes, but try a more common lightweight IRC client
[13:36] <cristian_c> MonkeyDust, If I type /set, nothing happens :O
[13:36] <MonkeyDust> cristian_c  it seems nobody had ever heard of lostirc
[13:36] <usr13> cristian_c: You have to give it some arguments
[13:37] <kostkon> Jun, you can always use a gui app, if you want, like this here: http://www.iloveubuntu.net/menulibre-1301-released-significant-under-hood-improvements
[13:37] <cristian_c> usr13, irssi is a command line client
[13:37] <usr13> cristian_c: /set quit_message <my personal quit message>  if it's irssi.  I dono about others.
[13:37] <Jun> kostkon: Yes. The script is already created. I want to click  on an icon on the desktop to launch the script.
[13:37] <cristian_c> usr13, oh, ok
[13:38] <shadow98> if i use file connect to server and connect to web dav server..how do i access that via  command line
[13:38] <kostkon> Jun, ok, then create the .desktop file, copy it to your desktop
[13:38] <MonkeyDust> cristian_c  consider using something else, if your client is too hard to use or configure
[13:38] <ActionParsnip> Jun: if you mark the file as executable, then right click the script -> properties. You can tell it to run in a terminal.
[13:39] <usr13> cristian_c: http://www.irssi.org/documentation
[13:39] <kostkon> Jun, pick a .desktop file from ~/.local/share/applications, copy it to your desktop, modify it accordingly and you are ready.
[13:39] <ActionParsnip> shadow98: look in /run/username/gvfs   I belive. run: mount   should show you
[13:40] <kostkon> Jun, for all the possible keys and values you can use, check the spec here, if you want: http://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/1.1/ar01s05.html
[13:41] <Jun> kostkon: I check it
[13:41] <kostkon> Jun, good
[13:41] <cristian_c> usr13, I see
[13:42] <kostkon> Jun, don't forget to make it executable after you finish with it

[13:46] <atmosx> erupter: no, on x86 HP laptop
[13:46] <usr13> davividal: Oh, all traffic for a particular domain name.  Well, that would be a function of your router really, or the /etc/hosts file.  Is your PC also a gateway router?

[13:53] <Styler2go> Hey Guys, i have another Question :D i have some problems on my new server with ffmpeg, it misses some codecs, is there a "codecpack" or some common codecs i need for ffmpeg convertion?

[13:54] <MonkeyDust> Styler2go  restricted extras
[13:54] <Rin> that too
[13:54] <Styler2go> what do you mean with restrict extras?
[13:55] <Rin> its a collection of non-free codecs
[13:55] <kostkon> Styler2go, install the package ubuntu-restricted-extras
[13:55] <cfhowlett> Styler2go, restricted extras is the codec-pack you want
[13:55] <Styler2go> ok installing...
[13:55] <Styler2go> why is it called "restricted"?

[14:07] <ironhalik> I'm looking into 3.8 kernel, or 3.7.5 for my quantal install
[14:07] <ikonia> ironhalik: why ?
[14:07] <ActionParsnip> ironhalik: raring doesn't use 3.8
[14:07] <ironhalik> some power improvements

[14:40] <ikonia> nginx is acting as s dns server ?
[14:40] <repsaj> usr13: i was never sure how the root domain ever worked
[14:40] <repsaj> ikonia: yeah
[14:41] <usr13> repsaj: The bottom line is that if the site that is served by apache2 is not accessable, and apache2 is not running, then task #1 would be to start apache.  service start apache2

[14:50] <repsaj> usr13: i'm pretty sure i only have nginx running
[14:50] <SeanyRocks> Hello everyone
[14:50] <usr13> repsaj: No, you told me you had both running. (I assumed you had them running on two different ports.)  Sorry, I missunderstood you.
[14:51] <repsaj> usr13: no, i'm sorry for the confusion, i'm a newb, i think i saw a message saying that i had apache running, so i just assumed that it was.
[14:51] <usr13> repsaj: So how do you have nginx set up?  Do you have VirtualHosts?
[14:52] <cjae> 10.04 still supported and is chntpw in it?
[14:52] <cjae> it is in 9.04 and 12.10 why wouldnt it be in 1.04
[14:52] <cjae> 10.04*
[14:53] <usr13> repsaj: You should probably join #nginx
[14:53] <dBLOOD> okay, thanks
[14:53] <ikonia> repsaj: you should really solve your name resolution problems first
[14:53] <repsaj> ikonia: yes, i'm having an issue with that.

Perhaps i'm searching the wrong keywords but how do i remove items from the Ubuntu's dash (I'm using 12.10) ? I've tried Alacarte but nothing changes. I've also tried editing .desktop files in /usr/share/applications which works but is not an ideal solution. For example if I hide the Universal Access app it removes that entry from System Settings
[14:54] <SeanyRocks> well. I would like it stay in system settings but I dont need to have it shown in the dash too.

[15:30] <ActionParsnip> skp1: does xterm work as expected?
[15:30] <jrib> Xetius: I don't know of an app that does that offhand.  You could hack something together so that when you press ctrl-alt-l it runs script_lock_or_layout and inside the script check for which window has focus
[15:30] <skp1> ActionParsnip: except for the global menu, yeah
[15:30] <skp1> it has a menubar inside the window though

[15:45] <usr13> hsnmck: Strange request.  What are these two interfaces plugged into?
[15:45] <ActionParsnip> shakaponk: you'd use unetbootin to put the ISO on the USB stick (I assume you MD5 tested the file)

[16:05] <orb> Does the line at the bottom have the time that is from when you plugged in the ipod?
[16:05] <MJK1> orb, yes it does
[16:05] <orb> What is it showing? Like /dev/sdb1 maybe?
[16:05] <MJK1> sdl
[16:05] <MJK1> orb, sdl, and sdl1, actually
[16:06] <orb> For some reason Ubuntu isn't automatically mounting it.

[16:06] <Dougie187> I'm having a weird issue in the gnome terminal. When ever I type a directory (like /tm for example) and then hit tab to complete it, it finishes the name as /tmp and then adds a space at the end of the directory, instead of a /. Anyone have any ideas how to fix this?
[16:06] <MJK1> and it was doing that just fine last week.
[16:07] <orb> You could automatically mount it.
[16:07] <orb> Have you tried just restarting the OS?
[16:07] <JuJuBee> I installed ubuntu 12.10 on a machine and I use nis, but on the login screen I only see the local user that was created on install.  I can login via ctrl-alt-f1 using my network account, but how do I do this from gui?
[16:07] <orb> You can automatically mount it like this:
[16:07] <JuJuBee> With kubuntu, the login screen was username and password
[16:07] <orb> mkdir /media/ipod
[16:07] <orb> mount /dev/sd1 /media/ipod
[16:07] <MJK1> orb, I've restarted the OS, I've logged out and logged back in, I've restarted the iPod itself, and I've gotten no results. I'll try that right now, thanks
[16:07] <orb> or
[16:08] <orb> /dev/sdl1 actually.

[16:09] <orb> well, not sdl

[16:13] <MJK1> okay, I just made the directory, I think, orb. now I'm going to try that command again
[16:13] <ActionParsnip> lacrymology: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/01/install-oracle-java-jdk-7-in-ubuntu-via.html
[16:14] <MJK1> orb: nothing happened. I went to the computer folder and it's named "160 GB Drive". I right-clicked, and tried to eject, and it said it can't be ejected, because it's mounted
[16:14] <orb> MJK1, i may have lost sight of what it is you want to do - you just want to mount the ipod as a drive and access its files?
[16:14] <crypted> how would one patch a very old 1.1.2 to something newer w/o having to redev the entire config for a device?
[16:14] <crypted> err ignore
[16:14] <MJK1> orb: I want my iPod to mount so I can sync it
[16:15] <orb> MJK1, to unmount it, do either of: umount /dev/sdl1
=== blair_ is now known as rumel
[16:15] <orb> or umount /media/ipod
=== rumel is now known as lemur
[16:15] <evanderv> Hi everyone.
=== lemur is now known as femur
[16:15] <noobysauce> hello
[16:15] <orb> MJK1, this is the manual way to do it - you probably want it to work automatically and I don't know why it's not. This manual way of doing it might be more of a pain in the ass than you want.
[16:16] <belgianguy> or is SFTP with password protected SSH keys overkill?
[16:16] <orb> But anyway, once it is mounted it, I assume you can use your ipod program and point it to /media/ipod
[16:16] <MJK1> orb: "umount: /dev/sdl1 is not mounted (according to mtab)
[16:16] <orb> try the other, /media/ipod
[16:16] <MJK1> I right-clicked it in Nautilus, and it says it
[16:16] <evanderv> Any idea how I can track down how a zip file is being created every night around midnight?  I have looked through cron files and no such luck.  I know what user creates it.
[16:16] <jkbbwr> how can i block all requests to port 80 unless the source is in a whitelist:?
[16:16] <orb> If /media/ipod isn't mounted, then perhaps Nautilus figured out how to do it on its own.
[16:16] <MJK1> and it says it's mounted*
[16:17] <orb> From the command line simply type the word "mount" and see all things mounted. Try to figure out which one is the ipod.
[16:18] <orb> It won't be an ext filetype and it won't be the thing mounted as /
[16:18] <MJK1> orb, could this be it? "gvfsd-fuse on /run/user/daniel/gvfs type fuse.gvfsd-fuse (rw,nosuid,nodev,user=daniel"
[16:18] <orb> hmm, no, not under /run, it would be under /dev i'm pretty sure.
[16:18] <orb> unless it's some kinda new feature i'm unaware of.
[16:18] <orb> Ubuntu 12.04?
[16:18] <MJK1> orb, the only thing under dev is sdb5
[16:18] <MJK1> 12.10
[16:19] <lacrymology> ActionParsnip: I've got oracle-java8-installer, the link you sent talks about java7. Now, if I have that installed, and java -version returns the right thing, how come some java apps complain about the java version? is the app (jDownloader) wrong, or maybe I have two versions of java lying around?
[16:19] <orb> MJK1, that sounds right - can you just paste that line here?
[16:19] <orb> or type
[16:19] <awsoonn> hi all, I just installed ubuntu-server on a computer and the screen size appears to be larger than the physical display. I'm not seeing part of the right and bottom of the screen. What can I do to fix this?
[16:20] <godzirra> Hey guys.  If I'm using ubuntu 12.10, where do I edit my core xorg.conf?  I'm trying to get a displaylink adapter working.
[16:20] <MJK1> orb, sdb5 can't be my iPod, though, because it's an ext4
[16:20] <godzirra> So I need to edit my monitors and such.
[16:20] <orb> awsoonn, is that text only?
[16:20] <awsoonn> yea, just console
[16:20] <shade34321> I am using a nfs mount for /home on a few computers. I recently upgraded this and rsync the home directories between the two. Now when I log in it loads my wallpaper but just freezes there Any idea why?
[16:20] <orb> MJK1, well, it could ext4 if your formatted the ipod by accident.
[16:20] <lacrymology> ActionParsnip: I can confirm that the problem's not with the java command, but with javac
[16:20] <awsoonn> I should note that the grub menu also appears to have the same problem.
[16:21] <orb> MJK1, maybe you should try it on Windows.
[16:21] <orb> That might explain why things aren't working.
=== yann_ is now known as YannT
[16:21] <belgianguy> okay, SFTP will have to do :p
[16:22] <MJK1> orb, sdb5 is my partitioned hard drive. I split it in two. I'll try to stick it in on Windows. and then I should eject it, and come back on Ubuntu?
[16:22] <orb> I think that depends on what Windows demonstrates.
[16:22] <orb> if it can't mount or use the ipod, you may just have to run an itunes restore of it.
[16:22] <jappleseed> hi
[16:23] <MJK1> orb: what am I hoping will happen on Windows? okay, I can do that.
[16:23] <MJK1> gonna get to it now. I'll come back with my results
[16:23] <jrib> shade34321: check ~/.xsession-errors
[16:23] <orb> MJK1, which would mean formatting the ipod. Hope you had a backup.
[16:24] <shade34321> jrib: ok, give me just a sec since I just restared unity on it to see if that helps
[16:25] <rdffffff> ch rm #pat
[16:29] <jkbbwr> I have ufw installed, I have 80, 8080 and http in the firewall rules
[16:29] <MJK1> orb: worked like a charm!
[16:30] <ActionParsnip> MJK1: the eject made it ok?
[16:30] <jkbbwr> Seriously
[16:30] <MJK1> ActionParsnip: yeah, Windows mounted it, then I ejected and came back to Ubuntu, and it mounted here too
[16:30] <ActionParsnip> MJK1: like I said, you must use the feature. It's there for a reason.
[16:30] <jkbbwr> ufw isn't blocking properly
[16:31] <ActionParsnip> MJK1: thats why its the first thing I ask
[16:31] <MJK1> ActionParsnip: I will from now on, thank you
[16:31] <ActionParsnip> no worries :)
[16:31] <MJK1> have a good day, everyone!
[16:31] <shade34321> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1586302/ that is my ~/.xsession-errors
[16:31] <TomyLobo> "The function gpgme_get_key gets the key with the fingerprint (or key ID) fpr from the crypto backend" - how do i store something in that crypto backend?
[16:31] <shade34321> can I just delete those files and get them remade?
[16:32] <jrib> shade34321: does this happen with a fresh new account?
[16:33] <shade34321> jrib: haven't tried that. Got roughly 40 users and don't really want to make them all new accounts:/
[16:33] <jrib> shade34321: just for troubleshooting purposes
[16:33] <shade34321> jrib: ok. Give me a second
[16:33] <jkbbwr> how can I deny all traffic bar 22 to my system using ufw
[16:33] <jrib> !ufw | jkbbwr
[16:33] <ubottu> jkbbwr: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.
[16:33] <jkbbwr> because atm ufw has the block rule and its still letting traffic through
[16:33] <jkbbwr> 80                         DENY        Anywhere
[16:33] <jkbbwr> 8080                       DENY        Anywhere
[16:33] <jkbbwr> 80/tcp                     DENY        Anywhere
[16:34] <jkbbwr> But I can still hit port 80 just fine
[16:34] <ry|an> I can tell
[16:34] <ry|an> whats the problem here
[16:34] <jrib> jkbbwr: is ufw enabled?
[16:34] <ry|an> you are using ufw instead of iptables
[16:34] <jkbbwr> ry|an: so?
[16:34] <ActionParsnip> jkbbwr: tried restarting ufw?
[16:34] <martyn> hallo
[16:34] <ry|an> that's obviousyl the source of this problem

[16:35] <thankless> Good day/night fellow ubuntees (old and new)
[16:36] <jrib> ry|an: stop please
[16:36] <ActionParsnip> jkbbwr: did you allow 22/tcp through?
[16:36] <ActionParsnip> ry|an: ufw isn't bad at all
[16:36] <ry|an> jrib I'm just trying to save this man from the pain and suffering ufw causes
[16:36] <jrib> ry|an: yes, ok you've made it clear that you prefer iptables over ufw, let's move on to actually offering help

[17:02] <gandhijee_> ActionParsnip: umm, they took 10.10 and stripped it down to what they needed.

[17:21] <NewbieBodhi> does anyone know which version of the game, the package warzone2100 is?
[17:22] <jkbbwr> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1586439/
[17:22] <llutz> !info warzone2100 | NewbieBodhi
[17:22] <ubottu> NewbieBodhi: warzone2100 (source: warzone2100): 3D real time strategy game. In component universe, is optional. Version 3.1~rc2-1ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 1512 kB, installed size 3620 kB
[17:22] <ddosantos> I am still having some issues when mounting my external drive :-s
[17:22] <atlef> !warzone2100
[17:22] <usr13> magma: tty1-6 are console systems that you can use (on most all Linux systems).
[17:22] <ddosantos> I have my path /media/drive with permissions 777 and owned by root
[17:22] <atlef> !warzone
[17:22] <ddosantos> then mount the device
[17:22] <atlef> hmm
[17:23] <ddosantos> the path becomes owned by my user
[17:23] <MonkeyDust> Aknot  guess that would take centuries
[17:23] <ddosantos> and permissions change
[17:23] <magma> usr13, what's a console system?
[17:23] <ddosantos> so I can't share it by samba
[17:23] <ActionParsnip> ddosantos: what file system are you mounting?
[17:23] <ddosantos> ntfs
[17:23] <ddosantos> an Iomega device
[17:23] <usr13> magma: It's a mode not necessarily a system.
[17:23] <ActionParsnip> ddosantos: thought so, sharing ntfs with samba is painful
[17:24] <magma> ok
[17:24] <ActionParsnip> ddosantos: you need to set the permissions on the mount so that everyone has full access, you cannoy chmod / chown ntfs
[17:24] <usr13> magma: tty1-6 are console terminals.  tty7 is for the GUI and tty8 and above are not used, (on most linux systems, not all).
[17:24] <ddosantos> yeah but I thought I could chmod /media/drive before mounting
[17:24] <magma> I see
[17:25] <magma> thanks
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest81026
[17:25] <ddosantos> didn't expect it would loose the permissions AFTER mount
[17:25] <ActionParsnip> ddosantos: its set at mount time. I suggest you add an entry in /etc/fstab so it mounts correctly
=== poop_assistant is now known as thievery_corp
[17:25] <ddosantos> yes, I did
[17:25] <zykotick9> qhartman: just side note - while it is ctrl+alt+fX from Xorg, once in a virtual console you only require alt+FX to switch (or alt+arrow key)
[17:25] <ddosantos> UUID="D27431CF7431B6D7" /media/drive ntfs-3g defaults,locale=es_ES.UTF-8 0 1
[17:26] <ddosantos> it does mount when typing mount /media/drive
[17:26] <ddosantos> but permissions become drwx------
[17:27] <ddosantos> they are drwxrwxrwx when umounted
[17:27] <llutz> ddosantos: you use mount-options like uid/gid/umask, not chown/chmod on non-unix-filesystems like ntfs
[17:28] <ddosantos> llutz can you explain a little more?
[17:28] <mojtaba> ActionParsnip: It is completed with no error

[18:07] <usr13> mojtaba: If the system is totally locked up you'll get no response from keyboard or mouse at all.  In that case you may or may not be able to login via ssh from another PC on your LAN, in which case you can give command to shutdown or reboot.
[18:07] <millennia> mojtaba | would you say this is a problem of the mouse clicks no longer being detected?

[18:08] <mojtaba> usr13: I have run it and it was green
[18:09] <mojtaba> recon_lap: Thanks a million
[18:09] <millennia> mojtaba | a moving mouse means it is not a system lockup from bad ram
[18:09] <usr13> mojtaba: How much RAM do you have?
[18:09] <mojtaba> usr13: 4G
[18:09] <mojtaba> millennia: I think so
[18:10] <millennia> mojtaba | can you try a different mouse?
[18:10] <usr13> mojtaba: Is your install 32bit or 64bit?
[18:10] <mojtaba> millennia: what do you mean?
[18:10] <mojtaba> usr13: 64
[18:10] <millennia> mojtaba | do you have the ability to plugin a different mouse to use?
[18:10] <usr13> mojtaba: When the mouse won't click on anything, is the keyboard still working ok?
[18:11] <mojtaba> millennia: The mouse is running well under other OSs and machines.
[18:11] <mojtaba> usr13: no
[18:12] <millennia> mojtaba | that may well be, but plugging in a different mouse would help you narrow down the problem
[18:12] <mojtaba> The keyboard is not working also, I guess. because I tried to use alt-tab, alt-ctrl-del, and no one worked.
[18:13] <millennia> mojtaba | is your keyboard usb?

[18:19] <macswell> I have a laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 x64 installed that kernel panics whenever the ac-power(mains) is unplugged. It panics 1-2 seconds after being unplugged. Can anyone help?
[18:19] <millennia> mojtaba | that doesn't mean it's not usb
[18:19] <mojtaba> millennia: How can I check that?
[18:19] <usr13> skp1: If the install did not complete, you're probably going to need to start over.
[18:20] <millennia> mojtaba | see if your keyboard or mouse show up in "lsusb"
=== mark_zuckerberg is now known as zzzzzzombie
[18:20] <millennia> mojtaba | if you have no use at all in ubuntu, see if windows says it's a usb kb+mouse
[18:20] <usr13> mojtaba: The USB plugs are rectangular (wide, flat), PS2 is round.
[18:21] <mojtaba> millennia: How can I check it?
[18:21] <millennia> mojtaba | in windows you can check from device manager
[18:21] <skp1_> usr13: it's not a new install, i've been using this for a few days now. i set 'random effects for all events' in compiz and it froze so i pressed alt ctrl prt scrn b to reboot now when it logs in i cant use the mouse
=== zzzzzzombie is now known as sanskarimata
[18:22] <skp1_> usr13: i know the mouse works cuz i've used it with a live cd and a usb drive with 12.10 on it
[18:22] <escott> i have a friend who needs to use the NVIDIA drivers but not the apt packaged ones. For some reason Xorg is trying to use the 310.32 but the kernel is loading the old modules
[18:22] <usr13> skp1_: What is "alt ctrl prt scrn b"?
[18:22] <recon_lap> mojtaba: this seem like the same bug, but a older report https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xorg-server/+bug/41301
[18:22] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 41301 in xorg-server (Ubuntu) "Mouse clicks stop working sporadically" [Medium,Confirmed]
[18:22] <millennia> mojtaba | windows might be the only way to check if your ubuntu is not responding

[18:23] <ubottu> usr13 skp1_: In an emergency, you may be able to shutdown cleanly and reboot by holding down Alt+PrintScreen and typing, in succession, R, E, I, S, U and B. For an explanation, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
[18:23] <usr13> skp1_: Ok.  I'll take your word for it.
[18:24] <mojtaba> millennia: let me see
[18:24] <usr13> escott: Tnx
[18:24] <skp1_> escott: oh, ok
[18:24] <usr13> skp1_: What kind of mouse is it?
[18:24] <usr13> skp1_: PS2 or USB ?
[18:24] <skp1_> usb
[18:25] <usr13> skp1_: Try un-plugging and plugging in again.
[18:25] <skp1_> usr13: i did
[18:25] <mojtaba> millennia: It is not in the list
[18:25] <usr13> skp1_: Are you sure the mouse is ok?  (Not broken?)
[18:25] <skp1_> usr13: also unity loads very slowly and my internet connection wont work
[18:26] <skp1_> usr13: yes, i was just using it
[18:26] <millennia> mojtaba | that's strange, windows device manager always lists my keyboard and mouse as devices
[18:26] <mojtaba> usr13: I knew that, but the question is about the integrated ones.
[18:26] <skp1_> usr13: i booted a usb drive and it worked
[18:26] <usr13> mojtaba: Oh, ok.
[18:26] <mojtaba> millennia: how can I do that?
[18:26] <usr13> mojtaba: Did you look at that bug report?
[18:27] <mojtaba> millennia: let me see
[18:27] <skp1_> usr13: i just booted into an older kernel and the mouse and internet work fine. what should i do?
[18:28] <usr13> skp1_: Do you have /etc/X11/xorg.conf  file?
[18:28] <skp1_> usr13: no
[18:28] <usr13> skp1_: How new is the newest kernel?  (How long ago did it get installed?
[18:28] <mojtaba> usr13: There were many information, I could not understand it
[18:29] <skp1_> usr13: this install is only a few days old, but the trouble seemed to start when i was messing with the animations in compiz.
[18:29] <mojtaba> millennia: How can I find device manager?
[18:29] <macswell> I have a laptop with Ubuntu 12.04 x64 installed that kernel panics whenever the ac-power(mains) is unplugged. It panics 1-2 seconds after being unplugged. Can anyone help?

[18:30] <usr13> and version
[18:30] <recon_lap> mojtaba: to summarize, seems like you affected by a unity bug, the bug is reported but no solution has been found yet. options from here are extreme.
[18:31] <Cortez> hey guys, i need some help with ufw. You see when i do a ufw status i get 5 ports allowed, but when i do a nmap -sS 127.0.0.1 i only get 2 open ports?
[18:31] <millennia> mojtaba | depending on your version of windows, it should be a part of your system settings applet
[18:31] <skp1_> usr13: jan 29
[18:31] <escott> zykotick9, can't remember if you have much experience with nvidia
[18:32] <usr13> skp1_: I'd say, just use the previous kernel for now.
[18:32] <mojtaba> millennia: I can not find it in the system setttings

[18:32] <skp1_> usr13: is there no command i can use to reset compiz?
[18:33] <millennia> mojtaba | I'm sorry then, I'm pretty lost in windows, I stopped using windows around vista
[18:33] <usr13> skp1_: It quit working after reboot and so there is something wrong with the compiz settings on this new kernel, so, I'd just use the previous one for not.
[18:33] <mojtaba> millennia: I am not using windows.
[18:33] <usr13> skp1_: You could go back into compiz settings and change it back to what it was before.
[18:33] <mojtaba> millennia: I just installed ubuntu yesterday on windows 7
[18:34] <skp1_> usr13: i already did
[18:34] <usr13> skp1_: Then just use the previous kernel for now.
[18:34] <usr13> at least until the next kernel update
[18:34] <millennia> mojtaba | Oh I thought you were. But if you are not using windows, I can't think of any way to check whether your kb and mouse are usb, given that your ubuntu is locked up and unresponsive
[18:36] <recon_lap> millennia: his ubuntu is not locked up, he is losing mouse click events.
[18:36] <millennia> recom_lap | oh. I thought he said his keyboard was locked up too (?)
[18:37] <zykotick9> escott: while i have used nvidia drivers extensivly, i have never used non-repo versions - since... i can't remember when...

[18:41] <escott> zykotick9, ok. a friend of mine who was doing some CUDA work wanted to update the CUDA stack and tried to go non-repo... X was loading the newest driver but the kernel kept probing the old module and i couldn't figure out from where
[18:41] <Axljackass> *singapore
[18:41] <escott> zykotick9, i think he is just going to reinstall (this is what happens when people do things without asking first :))
[18:42] <zykotick9> escott: in cases like that, i'd suggest removing all the old nvidia stuff, and simply reinstall the new... but that is just a very "gerneral" type suggestion.  sorry, don't have any specific suggestions...
[18:43] <kevinmthomas> hi everyone.  I have ubuntu server installed and a wireless printer set up on a local 192 port.  I installed cups how do I set it up to print correctly?
[18:43] <escott> zykotick9, no problem... thats pretty all i can think to do myself
[18:45] <recon_lap> mojtaba: as it stands I think you stuck with the bug, so i'd suggest xubuntu, it uses a different window manager(xfce) and a good chance that it will not have the same bug. it's got a old fashioned GUI though.
[18:45] <mojtaba> recon_lap: Can I add xfce to my machine from the unity?
[18:45] <kevinmthomas> anyone?
[18:46] <recon_lap> mojtaba: you only installed a day, I'd recommend a clean install, should only take about 45 min

=== glebihan_ is now known as glebihan
[19:49] <shomon> i think it's the latest version but not sure how to find out
[19:49] <DuncanNZ> not sure why that would happen
[19:49] <DuncanNZ> you could type in a terminal: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[19:49] <DuncanNZ> to check everything happened properly
[19:50] <krywk> zykotick9, well, no, it's still the same.
[19:50] <shomon> okay thanks DuncanNZ
[19:50] <zykotick9> krywk: if that cat test isn't showing output, i can't explain what you are experiencing in game.  sorry, i don't have any other suggestions - best of luck.

[19:51] <arussel> I see from the log that the my script in /etc/init.d was run. What is the difference between doing 'sudo /etc/init.d/foo' and when the script run at boot time ?
[19:51] <DuncanNZ> ok
[19:51] <shomon> maybe ubuntu's recent changes make it too slow on this computer.. but from one day to the next..

[19:52] <DuncanNZ> yea seems odd
[19:52] <DuncanNZ> so did you run the command?
[19:52] <zykotick9> krywk: i wouldn't think so, but not sure.  i'm not much of a wine person anymore (beverage or software ;)

[20:08] <judahitewarrior7>  Hi, I am having problems accessing Hebrew fonts in LibreOffice Writer. Whenever I try to select a certain Hebrew font, it will not switch from the default Hebrew font "Lohit Hindi". Can anyone help?
[20:09] <roasted> Question - I just installed two 3TB HDDs. They have GPT tables as per GParted from Lubuntu LiveUSB 12.04. In GParted, the first sector is listed as 2048. However, if I run fdisk -l against them even though fdisk isn't supported for larger disks, it says the first sector is 1. Why is fdisk reporting 1 while gparted is reporting 2048?
[20:10] <przemek> hello do you know guys how to format usb drive in ubuntu?
[20:10] <zykotick9> roasted: don't use fdisk.  end of story.
[20:10] <roasted> zykotick9: :D
[20:10] <zykotick9> roasted: parted -l does same as fdisk -l
[20:10] <roasted> zykotick9: is there an equivalent to "fdisk -l" for gdisk or parted?
[20:11] <roasted> bingo
[20:11] <roasted> nailed it. appreciate it zykotick9
[20:11] <DuncanNZ> przemek gparted
[20:11] <przemek> :D
[20:11] <roasted> zykotick9: parted -l reports my "start" as 1049kB...
[20:12] <DuncanNZ> @premezek: you can right click a partition in gparted and choose "format to"
[20:12] <threex5> hi, i disabled compositing manager in compizconfig settings, and it seems to have killed unity entirely. I can't even logout. what do i do?

[20:12] <roasted> zykotick9: ah okay
[20:13] <mibofra> Can I ask for a problem of supybot plugin PackageInfo ?
[20:13] <roasted> zykotick9: I just wanted to make sure things were aligned properly. I kept hearing 2048 was the first sector that should be written to, which is what gparted reports but this 1049kB for parted confuswed me.

[21:34] <Bubo> No Pici
[21:34] <Bubo> no virtualenv
[21:34] <Pici> Bubo: Is there a reason you're not using the package in the repositories?
[21:35] <Bubo> What package Pici
[21:35] <Bubo> It says "The required version of distribute (>=0.6.28) is not available," and in the paste I gave you, the first command installs a version higher than that one.. Which is weird
[21:36] <Michelfp> i'm trying to compile eggdrop but i get this error

[21:37] <ubottu> Michelfp: Compiling software from source? Read the tips at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompilingSoftware (But remember to search for pre-built !packages first). Also read !checkinstall
[21:37] <Pici> Michelfp: Also, eggdrop is in the Ubuntu repositories
[21:37] <Michelfp> o
[21:37] <Pici> Bubo: one moment

[21:41] <Bubo> Pici: I found python-mysqldb, which worked.. I just hope it's not some old, old, version
[21:41] <Bubo> Pici: from the repos, apt-get install python-mysqldb

[21:46] <source_> Hello
[21:47] <source_> Would anyone know why I have to log out then log back in for my mouse to work?
[21:47] <ThinkT510> source_: perhaps your mouse is just too awesome for your desktop to handle
[21:47] <Bubo> Ok Pici. Any idea for my other problem??
[21:48] <source_> Hahaha I wish. It only clicks certain windows. Unless i log out and login. Then it works fine.
[21:48] <nibbler>  i'm just migrating to digikam, was using f-spot before. when importing my collections, sometimes the tags, saved in Subject (XMP i assume) like "tag1, tag2, tag3" get imported as ONE tag, sometimes they get split, resulting in three distinct tags. how to make it distinct tags everytime?
[21:50] <dartos> What video drivers should I get for the GTX560Ti?
[21:50] <dartos> The only drivers I see on the software center say they are for gtx 600+
[21:52] <daftykins> dartos: doesn't matter. those'll be fine.
[21:52] <Castial> hey I have a Gnome-shell/Unity issue and its an issue on both machines
[21:53] <Castial> I need to add wine to the "open with" as default
[21:53] <dave_ubuntu> hi, whenever i try and install the 13.1 catalyst drivers for my ati4850, it'll create an xorg.conf and when i reboot it'll make my monitors out of range on the login screen, if i remove the xorg it still doesn't work. any help?
[21:53] <dartos> daftykins: I think I'll try the ones from their site. I didn't know they had Linux versions from the geforce site. Sorry for the bother
[21:54] <daftykins> dartos: i'd recommend using the hardware drivers over downloading manually. APT is healthier
[21:54] <dartos> daftykins: What do you mean APT? I am pretty new to linux...
[21:55] <daftykins> dartos: it's the way software packages are downloaded and installed automagically
[21:55] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, you have odd monitors probably try opening the xorg.conf files with a text editor, and set the htz to 60 and set the resolution to what it is the monitors are suppose to have
[21:55] <dartos> Oh
[21:55] <dartos> apt-get
[21:55] <Castial> simply deleting the xorg will recreate it with the ati drivers
[21:55] <daftykins> dartos: yep. just try the latest version the hardware drivers program offers you and see how it goes
[21:56] <dartos> I had to get that additional drivers program from the software center
[21:56] <Castial> how do I add Wine to the programs list, there is no "use custom command" anymore
[21:56] <dartos> but there are 4 drivers in that thing...
[21:56] <dartos> 2 beta and 2 non-beta
[21:56] <dave_ubuntu> Castial, I've tried that. Gave them a VertRefresh (iirc) for my range.
[21:56] <Castial> you dont need to
[21:56] <dartos> daftykins: your talking about jockey-kde right?
[21:56] <Castial> just set it to 6-htz
[21:56] <Castial> 60 rather
[21:56] <Bubo> How do I fix this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587061/ - thanks
[21:57] <Castial> and set it to the proper resolution
[21:57] <ubuntu346> im trying to recover a RAID0 array, using testdisk, after resetting it through RAID BIOS - but testdisk is accessing the disk with CHS 34632452345 1 1 - and throwing warnings left and right, about incorrect sectors and/or heads... would these errors keep me from finding my original partitions ?
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> my monitor doesn't support 60, that's the issue
[21:57] <daftykins> dartos: sure
[21:57] <Castial> then get a better monitor
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> its 70-85 by the looks.
[21:57] <Castial> then set it to 85
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> yeah i'll do just that
[21:57] <daftykins> dave_ubuntu: is it a CRT?
[21:57] <Castial> if its crt it supports as low as 56
[21:57] <dave_ubuntu> its 2 x flat
[21:58] <daftykins> all LCDs support 59/60
[21:58] <Castial> if none of the higher ones work, set it to 56
[21:59] <Castial> daftykins, not all some only support "56" but are oh heavens whats that word
[21:59] <Castial> there is no refresh rate per say and its set to 56
[21:59] <dartos> daftykins: it seems that the driver install failed
[21:59] <Castial> how do I get the latest nvidia drivers
[21:59] <daftykins> Castial: yeah. never seen 56 :O that's a new one on me and i've seen a lot
[21:59] <OerHeks> Castial, resetting the monitor with its own menu might help
[22:00] <Castial> I had them installed through the terminal and an update broke them
[22:00] <Castial> so I had to revert to the 304 ones
[22:00] <Castial> is there a deb of the 310 ones?
[22:02] <dartos> I tried installing the nvidia drivers but it failed :'(
[22:02] <dartos> here is the log from jockey
[22:02] <dartos> http://pastebin.com/i6xUgy6U
[22:02] <Castial> oh ok they are in the repositories as "experimental"
[22:02] <Castial> cool
[22:02] <dartos> If anyone would be so kind to help me out
[22:02] <Castial> remove the nvidia drivers
[22:03] <dartos> Castial: there are none fresh install...
[22:03] <Castial> sudo apt-get remove nvidia*
[22:03] <Castial> sudo apt-get update

[22:03] <dartos> Castial: oh the experimental one... that might do it
[22:03] <Castial> get rid of the + at the end there
[22:03] <Castial> they arent beta
[22:03] <Castial> they are in final form
[22:04]  * dartos shrugs
[22:04] <dartos> okay

[22:28] <Castial> Wine shows up in the right click menu
[22:28] <Castial> how do I add it to the other programs list
[22:29] <Castial> there is no "use command" button anymore
[22:29] <Castial> what do I do?
[22:29] <Castial> it is the same on both Gnome-Shell and Unity
[22:30] <ZeloZelos> Castial, the run command is still there, hit the window button, type run...if i remember correctly..havent used it in a while
[22:31] <Castial> I wish they would allow me to "create link"
[22:31] <Castial> why the hell did canonical remove that
[22:31] <Castial> its so damn annoying
[22:31] <ZeloZelos> drag n drop to desktop makes links still i think
[22:31] <Castial> nope just a copy
[22:32] <Castial> I make a link, and if the link isnt in the folder it doesnt work
[22:32] <Castial> they took a completely workable system and completely broke it
[22:32] <Castial> ok cool I got the link on the desktop
[22:33] <Castial> but there is no way to change the options anymore
[22:33] <dave_ubuntu> it was the resolution that needed to be defined and used with the aticonfig tool
[22:33] <Castial> it used to be easy god
[22:33] <dave_ubuntu> fun tmes
[22:33] <ZeloZelos> Castial, maybe you will like mint better instead
[22:33] <dave_ubuntu> cheers for the help guys
[22:33] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, same for Nvidia
[22:33] <Castial> ZeloZelos, ill give it a go later
[22:34] <dave_ubuntu> when in doubt, build your own closed source undocumented tool
[22:34] <Castial> it just seems ass backwards to not allow me to make desktop icons to applications
[22:34] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, same for Windows, OSX, Hurd, and any other system
[22:34] <Castial> even Intel has a tool now iirc
[22:35] <dave_ubuntu> you don't **need** one in windows
[22:35] <dave_ubuntu> for special driver specific stuff maybe
[22:35] <Castial> dave_ubuntu, because Microsoft dictates to them "you MUST use our system" on Linux hardware vendors have the freedom to do that
[22:35] <Castial> hence the term "freedom"
[22:35] <dave_ubuntu> indeed
[22:36] <Castial> I mean if thats your biggest annoyance you have other issues to learn like the fact they need you to add a repository to use up to date software
[22:37] <Castial> they need to keep the software in the repos more up to date
[22:37] <Castial> its annoying as piss to have 100000 repos for all the apps I use when 1 repository should do it
[22:37] <Castial> that was what they were meant to do, they were meant to remove confusion
[22:38] <bipul> Please if any one know how to fix this issue, then let me know http://pastebin.com/F5S54HVT
[22:38] <Castial> 1 repo to rule them all
[22:38] <Castial> not to mention Canonical removed all the emulators it used to have
[22:38] <Castial> it removed codecs
[22:39] <Castial> it removed anything that wasnt disney friendly
[22:39] <beandog> that is a gross oversimplification

[22:40] <calwig> lo
[22:41] <Castial> bipul, looks like a known bug
[22:41] <spydmobile> Hi folks, I have a headscratcher and need some bright ideas. I have a ubuntu server: Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-36-generic x86_64) that has a nealy full root partiton but for the life of me I have tried every trick I know to find why or how, but I cannot seem to find the bloat.
[22:41] <beandog> how full is full
[22:42] <spydmobile> beandog: /dev/mapper/smvmbackup64-root      15G   14G  373M  98% /
[22:42] <beandog> eh
[22:42] <beandog> that's normal
[22:42] <beandog> but install ncdu and run it at / and you can poke around to see what's using the most
[22:42] <beandog> If I had to guess, I'd say /home /var/log /tmp and /var/tmp
[22:42] <Castial> my gentoo server uses like 90% all the time for temp files
[22:43] <SolarisB1y> Castial: do you really think one repo is the answer to that?
[22:43] <Castial> clear your temp files and get janitor
[22:43] <beandog> Castial: tmpwatch ftw
[22:43] <Castial> beandog, that too
[22:43] <beandog> never used janitor
[22:43] <bipul> Castial, ?
[22:43] <Castial> janitor is a front end with some custom commands
[22:43] <Castial> same thing as tmpwatch but for other things
[22:43] <SolarisB1y> it seems like ubuntu like all other distros controls versions of software uploaded to their repo - i think it's normal and without it if those ppa versions got pushed to standard repos everyone would have a broken system
[22:44] <Castial> no we wouldnt
[22:44] <SDr> hello. using the command-line mail program, how can I scroll down in the list of incoming mails? (ie: got more, than 200 mails in there, need to check latest ones)
[22:44] <Castial> not if they did it right
[22:44] <spydmobile> beandog: ncdu shows my /usr at 650mb and my /var at 495mb
[22:44] <beandog> spydmobile: yah, that's a gig total, that's not much
[22:44] <SolarisB1y> which would in turn be making the core libraries unstable to do it "right"
[22:45] <Castial> not core libraries but applications
[22:45] <SolarisB1y> when each ppa pulls in it's own list of deps etc its gonna break stuff
[22:45] <Castial> like gimp wasnt the latest for over a year after its release
[22:45] <SolarisB1y> apps end up depending on core libraries somwehere it can't be prevented
[22:45] <bipul> is there any one who has performed network simulation emulation in ubuntu.
[22:45] <spydmobile> beandog: exactly, I have scoured and cant find anything even remotely big enough, this was a fresh install with a hand full of thingks like openssh etc...
[22:45] <Castial> I suppose its still annoyingly broken
[22:46] <chris__> Does anyone know how I can change the user that an upstart service is run as?
[22:46] <beandog> spydmobile: oh yah?  Hmm, because I generally do about 15G for a fresh install too.  You said server, right?
[22:46] <spydmobile> ?q
[22:46] <Castial> later peeps been real helping and all
[22:46] <SolarisB1y> install x and it wants to install it's own version of a-lib b-lib etc. where a-lib and b-lib required by app c which is also system app - broken system - there needs to be a working location to start from, thats why they did ppa's to let you break your own systems
[22:46] <beandog> Castial: laters
[22:46] <SolarisB1y> peace

[22:46] <spydmobile> beandog: sorry, you mean a base server install should hover near 15GB?
[22:47] <beandog> spydmobile: no, I was saying I'd probably do the same thing
[22:47] <beandog> spydmobile: a 15gb root install

[22:47] <beandog> spydmobile: anyway.  Dunno.  ncdu / will show something though
[22:47] <spydmobile> beandog: right, ya, more than enough for running KVM

[22:53] <xibalba> hey folks, anyone know if there is an Ubuntu OVF I can deploy quickly?
[22:54] <millennia> what is OVF?
[22:54] <xibalba> I dont want to have to run through the installer
[22:54] <xibalba> OVF = Open Virtual Format
[22:54] <xibalba> like a VM template
[22:54] <millennia> are you doing mass deployment to identical machines?
[22:55] <xibalba> no, i just need one handy because i generally quickly deploy an ubuntu box, test something, throw it away
[22:55] <xibalba> I can make my own, figured someone might have one already
[22:55] <jhutchins_wk> xibalba: So make your own.
[22:55] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, well that requires more time than i obviously wanted to invest...
[22:55] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, wonderful input btw, very helpful
[22:56] <Dessimat0r> i have no /etc/init.d/ssh or no /etc/init.d/sshd or /etc/init/ssh or /etc/init/sshd file with openssh-server installed on 12.10. What to do?
[22:56] <Dessimat0r> i reinstalled openssh-server
[22:56] <Dessimat0r> and nothing happened
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> i expect that the upstart script to detect ssh is missing
[22:57] <jrib> Dessimat0r: you have no idea why this is?
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> for whatever reason
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> but how to put that back?
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> i guess it is because of some hard disk corruption i suffered a while back
[22:57]  * xibalba throws jhutchins_wk a few packets to eat
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> but what package needs reinstalling in that case?
[22:57] <jrib> Dessimat0r: just purge openssh-server and install it again
[22:57] <Dessimat0r> something that handles the upstart init scripts
[22:58] <Dessimat0r> i did apt-get install openssh-server --reinstall
[22:58] <jrib> Dessimat0r: ok, now purge and install it again
[22:58] <Dessimat0r> that isn't the same as a purge/install?
[22:58] <Dessimat0r> ok
[22:58] <malkauns> in 12.10 why do i have no compress dialog when i want to compress a file in nautilus?
[22:58] <malkauns> nothing pops up

[23:00] <xibalba> OerHeks, thank you sir I appreciate the response
[23:00] <OerHeks> change quantal to precise for the 12.04 lts version
[23:00] <spydmobile> beandog: Wow, I found it - crazy. somehow, my huge backup partion must have not been mounted and a huge backup was made to the mountpoint then later when the backup partion was mounted and emptied, it hid the 12 gig of files backup there!!!!
[23:01] <spydmobile> cd ..
[23:01] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, learn from OerHeks
[23:02] <agrestringere_> ThinkT150 solved my issue today with the libc6 broken download wanted to thank the room #ubuntu for the help
[23:04] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, you must be bitter living in Kansas
[23:15] <Rayshi> Hello I'm a new ubuntu user, I've been having problems to install ubuntu on my computer. I had some issue which I pinpointed to my Ahci and I was led to believe using the option acpi=off should fix it. And it did for that issue. But now a new error has shown up http://imgur.com/PPxTVqI this screen just flashes until I shut down the pc. Thanks for any help ahead of time

[23:24] <Rayshi> any other official channels where I may find some help regarding my issue?
[23:24] <Chriys> what is your issue Rayshi
[23:25] <Rayshi> I've been having problems to install ubuntu on my computer. I had some issue which I pinpointed to my Ahci and I was led to believe using the option acpi=off should fix it. And it did for that issue. But now a new error has shown up http://imgur.com/PPxTVqI this screen just flashes until I shut down the pc. Thanks for any help ahead of time
[23:25] <beandog> Rayshi: kernel panic.  That sucks.  Which version are you installing
[23:25] <Rayshi> 12.10 i believe the lastest stable
[23:25] <ekristen> is there any tool out there to manage a apt repository via a GUI or web interface? following that question I'm looking at running dozens of ubuntu servers internally, is there a way to have an APT mirror, but where I can approve packages before they show up in the mirror?
[23:26] <beandog> Rayshi: what kind of hardware
[23:27] <Rayshi> Beandog: EVGA X58 Classified3 samsung 830 128GB any other part in specific?
[23:28] <Chriys> ekriten: to generate repository here is a lin =>http://repogen.simplylinux.ch/
[23:28] <Chriys> ekristen but what is the exact issue that you have
[23:29] <Chriys> do you have a particular error message
[23:29] <beandog> Rayshi: yah, dunno.  I dunno where to start with that
[23:30] <Rayshi> I'm going to try to update the bios
[23:30] <Rayshi> see if that helps any
[23:30] <beandog> Rayshi: okay.  My first inclination was to say to reset the bios to factory defaults.  If you feel comfortable with that.
[23:31] <Chriys> me too.
[23:32] <Rayshi> beandog: well I think the problem might be on ahci but I have to use ahci for TRIM

[23:35] <histo> Chriys: Also it's quite possible your ISP is block port 25 outbound
[23:36] <tab1293> I am trying to set up a pptp server on ubuntu but I am not sure what to use for the remote and local ip in pptpd.conf. here is my ifconfig output http://pastebin.ca/2308764
[23:36] <Chriys> histo: good remark. i have open the 25 on my router. do you know a way to verify that.
[23:38] <millennia> http://www.lunarforums.com/email_troubleshooting_and_tips/videotron_implements_outgoing_port_25_block-t26357.0.html
[23:39] <millennia> Chriys | yes it appear they did block port 25, and probably still do
[23:39] <Chriys> millenia thanks for the link. do you know if i can ask them to unblock it on my modem ?
[23:40] <histo> Chriys: A lot of ISP's block outbout port 25 to avoid people from setting up server to spam with.
[23:41] <Chriys> but question how thunderbird do to send email ?
[23:41] <histo> Chriys: becuase your isp's server is sending email out.  Not thunderbird
[23:41] <Chriys> histo: can i use another port instead of the 25 ?
[23:42] <millennia> Chriys | with a big isp like videotron, not much chance
[23:42] <millennia> Chriys | you can usually use port 465
[23:42] <barrett> my raid hard drives are beeping, this is not good, I rebooted and now the array didn't come up.  what can I do to test them?
[23:43] <millennia> Chriys | port 465 is smtp with ssl
[23:43] <Chriys> thanks millenia and how do i know if this port is open ?
[23:44] <histo> Chriys: I've only looked into setting up a mail server and understand the fundamentals. I've never actually done it. Because I was worried about spammers.  You may have better luck in #ubuntu-server.
[23:44] <Chriys> thanks histo
[23:44] <millennia> Chriys | you can tell if 465 is open by looking at videotron's faq, or by trying to use it with some mail server that offers ssl
[23:46] <_helios_> Finaly got my ssh server running had to change the port from 22 I think my ISP was blocking it.
[23:47] <histo> Chriys: You also might be able to use your isp's mail servers to relay messages
[23:48] <Chriys> that one can be cool histo
[23:50] <entreri> hey there, I added a new user and then deleted the old one. Now, I can't run sudo because my new user is not in sudoer file, the old user had administrator privilege... what can I do to grant privileges to new user ?
[23:50] <zykotick9> entreri: add the user to the sudo group (which might be tricky, as it requires sudo)
[23:51] <jrib> entreri: reboot in recovery mode to add the user to the sudo group
[23:51] <millennia> entreri | boot with the live cd and edit the group file
[23:52] <nIcestAdie> WOOOOO NICEST
[23:52] <entreri> lol, there is a way maybe to login as root ?
[23:52] <malkauns> in 12.10 how do i get empathy to remember my yahoo contacts?
[23:52] <jrib> entreri: reboot in recovery mode to add the user to the sudo group
[23:52] <ESphynx> hey guys, why is Quantal sooooo slow in VirtualBox ? And how do I disable these transitions or what not? clicking on a dock icon takes like 10 seconds with a super slow animation
[23:52] <ESphynx> note: I have 'animations' turned off in compiz settings manager
[23:52] <entreri> jrib: in recovery mode we have root access ?
[23:52] <jrib> entreri: yes
[23:53] <entreri> jrib: I will do that thanks
[23:53] <ESphynx> Quantal it's basically unusable in VirtualBox
[23:53] <Frozenthia> Hello, I have a graphics card: GeForce GTX 580 from NVIDIA. I'm using the latest Kubuntu version, for KDE. KDE freezes for nouveau, saying something like "nouveau lockup" if I give it a chance to blackscreen. It doesn't blackscreen at the logo fade, but it freezes.
[23:53] <jrib> I wonder if he knows how to add a user to a group
[23:54] <histo> ESphynx: That's possibly due to the removal of unity2d
[23:54] <ESphynx> histo why on earth would that be done
[23:54] <mattwj2002> hi guys ubuntu for android
[23:54] <ESphynx> histo know any work around?
[23:54] <mattwj2002> is that available yet?
[23:54] <mattwj2002> if so where is it at?
[23:55] <barrett> I'm really desperate is there anyone that can help me with my mdadm array not coming up?
[23:55] <Frozenthia> That was weird.
[23:55] <barrett> the hard drives seem to be making noises, beeping, I need to run some diagnostics or get it online to copy data off if its failling
[23:55] <histo> ESphynx: try a different desktop environment
[23:56] <kryl> hi, what about backup ntfs partition (with win vista) I used dd to backup & restore like normal. And don't touch the master boot record. But for the second time when I boot after restoring this partition win stay locked on the logo. Any advices please ? What am I doing wrong ?
[23:56] <histo> !phone | mattwj2002
[23:56] <ubottu> mattwj2002: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[23:56] <mattwj2002> thanks histo
[23:56] <mattwj2002> :d
[23:56] <Frozenthia> Anyway,when I install Nvidia-Current, and reboot, a "Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)" error comes up.
[23:57] <ESphynx> histo: Is there an easy way to switch? I don't care much for Unity.
[23:57] <millennia> ESphynx | xubuntu is good
[23:57] <ESphynx> millennia: i don't want to reinstall
[23:57] <histo> ESphynx: sure you can sudo apt-get install xfce   or kde or lxde or whatever DE you want to run.  Or you can install the meta packages like xubuntu-desktop lubuntu-desktop  etc...
[23:58] <millennia> ESphynx | all you have to do is replace unity with xfce and it's xubuntu :)
[23:58] <gmachine_24> Hi. I am wiping a laptop hd to reinstall Windows Vista (I am selling the computer) - there is an easy way, I believe, to overwrite the grub boot files etc. otherwise I end up dd'ing the entire drive.
[23:58] <histo> ESphynx: You don't need to reinstall to get xubuntu. Just sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop    and at the login screen click the ubuntu logo by your name to change the default session.
[23:58] <ESphynx> can I install cinnamon?
[23:58] <ESphynx> cinnamon is decent.
[23:59] <gmachine_24> Sorry, I am booting from a Ubuntu flash drive with 12.04 LTS live install
[23:59] <gmachine_24> ....... eegads...... flash drive as in USB drive
[23:59] <histo> gmachine_24: yeah dd is your safest bet. Something like dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M
[23:59] <histo> gmachine_24: assuming /dev/sda is the drive you want ot wipe
[23:59] <gmachine_24> histo yeah that's what I typically do ......... otherwise grub remains. Just looking for a shortcut
[23:59] <millennia> ESphynx | cinnamon is a forbidden topic
