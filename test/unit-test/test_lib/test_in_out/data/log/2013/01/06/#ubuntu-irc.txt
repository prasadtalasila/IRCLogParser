[10:57] <nhasian> Hello everyone
[11:01] <nhasian> who can I ask to get an Ubuntu cloak? my launchpad is https://launchpad.net/~nhasian
[11:03] <IdleOne> nhandler: You will need to wait here for one of the IRCC to get it applied. Be patient and they will get to it soon.
[11:03] <IdleOne> nhasian: ^
[11:05] <nhasian> IdleOne: don't worry, people do that all the time with nhandler and I.
[11:05] <IdleOne> AlanBell Pici Tm_T topyli funkyHat notice that nhasian is already in the cloaked people  team.
[11:05] <IdleOne> nhasian: what happened to your cloak?
[11:05] <nhasian> IdleOne: I didn't use my nick for months so the nick expired.
[11:06] <IdleOne> I see
[11:06] <nhasian> I'm guessing it just needs to be reapplied :)
[11:08] <IdleOne> yup
[11:08] <IdleOne> but they are probably all sleeping right now
[11:21]  * AlanBell is awake
[11:21] <AlanBell> huh, that is odd
[11:21] <AlanBell> staff can we have some help please
[11:22] <IdleOne> His nick must have been dropped during the last nickserv pruning
[11:22] <IdleOne> staff can probably confirm that.
