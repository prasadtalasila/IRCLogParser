[12:17] <dievel> Hi!
[12:18] <dievel> I new to edubuntu. I just installed the Edubuntu 12.04 on a server.
[12:18] <dievel> With LTSP. Thin clients works out of the box.
[12:19] <dievel> Now I need some hint on the administration of the users.
[12:20] <dievel> Is it different form Ubuntu? I'm asking because there is no "User Account" application in Administration Menu.
[12:20] <dievel> Should I use only the CLI or there are other managers?
[12:23] <dievel> Ok. I found the "User Account" icon :)
[12:24] <dievel> But my perplexity remain: which is the good way to manage accounts?

[13:37] <dievel> Hi, is there anybody?
[13:39] <alkisg> !ask
[13:39] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[14:05] <dievel> Sorry :) I was not sure about my irc client. Question: which is best practice to manage user accounts in Edubuntu? The standard "user Account" application or other managers?
[14:26] <alkisg> It depends on your usage
[14:26] <alkisg> If you're managing a few users, it's ok
[14:26] <alkisg> If you have ldap, you need a different tool
[14:26] <alkisg> If you're using a web interface to manage your server, there are other tools
[14:26] <alkisg> Some sysadmins also use scripts to create users
[14:41] <dievel> Well right now I'll start with few users and I'd like to use epoptes too. So I'll stick with standard management or CLI. Thanks.
[14:44] <alkisg> We developed a user management tool for local use here... we'll internationalize it next year, like we did with epoptes
[14:56] <isthakur_>  I want to setup an ltsp enviroment for windows os based clients or client that can run some windoes bases softwares such as dreamweaver, photoshop etc I wouldn't mind to use wine or any other windows emulator
[15:02] <alkisg> isthakur_: and your question is?
