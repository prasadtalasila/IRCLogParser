[03:03] <Omen__20> Hi. I'm getting different behavior using Glade than I see in the video tutorial.
[03:07] <Omen__20> When I add a button to a toolbar the options to select the icon or give the label text are disabled. In the video these options are available as soon as the widget is added.
[03:11] <Omen__20> It defaults to having the Use Action Appearence button as Yes and is disabled. If I add a related action and then clear it, it lets me turn that button off like it is in the video. Then it enables the icon and label options.

[16:10] <mojo706> anyone can answer this
[16:10] <mojo706> I need to access the panel
[16:11] <mojo706> and add an icon that sends notifications to my users
[16:11] <mojo706> once they connect to the internet
[16:15] <mhall119> mojo706: an indicator?
[16:15] <mojo706> yes
[16:15] <mhall119> or notifications
[16:16] <mhall119> they are are separate APIs
[16:16] <mojo706> mhall119: both an app indicator and notifications
[16:16] <mhall119> http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/application-indicators/ for indicators
[16:16] <mhall119> http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/technologies/notification/ for notifications
[16:16] <mhall119> should give you plenty of examples of how to do it
[16:17] <mojo706> mhall119: Let me read through thanks!

[16:57] <MOZGIII> Hello, can anyone give me an advice how to deploy a Qt 4 app on Ubuntu? I am doing linux deployment for the first time, and I don't really understand how does ubuntu guesses paths to libs.
[16:58] <MOZGIII> When I'm using ldd it shows some libs from ~/.QtSDK/... and I don't know how to force system libs usage for test purposes.
[18:49] <stqn> MOZGIII: I suppose you must link your program not with your SDK in ~ but with the system libs
[18:50] <stqn> it’s strange to see an SDK in ~… is this the official way to install it?
[18:51] <MOZGIII> stqn: Ho do I do that? I am using QtSDK's QtCreator for compilation
[18:51] <stqn> have you installed Qt with apt-get?
[18:51] <MOZGIII> This way was proposed on qt website when nokia was in chrge, now I don't know...
[18:52] <stqn> you should use your distribution’s installation method if possible
[18:52] <MOZGIII> ni, I've used installer from the website
[18:52] <MOZGIII> I see
[18:53] <MOZGIII> will the deployment be binary-compatible with the more recent versions of qt if maintainer update them?
[18:57] <stqn> I don’t understand your question
[18:57] <stqn> you mean, if you don’t update your closed-source app, and Ubuntu updates Qt, will it still work?
[18:58] <stqn> I think it should, as long as there is no ABI or API change
[19:02] <MOZGIII> well, I only see the problem in there
[19:04] <MOZGIII> I think I'd better bundle my own qt libs binaries, just to be safe - my app is cross-platform and updates it's binary on  it's own (I mean to debs or sth)
[19:05] <MOZGIII> so there is no particualr need for me to stick with system's qt version...
[19:07] <stqn> btw Ubuntu will only make potentially breaking changes to libs every 6 months
[19:07] <MOZGIII> I see
[19:08] <MOZGIII> stqn: thanks for your help, I'll investigate more on that, and now I must go
