[00:20] <allee> Mhmm, when a lib is GPL 2+, then  the code using the lib can't be LGPL 2.1+, right?  (other way round is okay)

[05:38] <philwyett> Morning. There is a conflict in the package kde-workspace_4.9.97-0ubuntu3. The new patch adds the line to install 'usr/share/kde4/services/kded/ktouchpadenabler.desktop' but this line is also in 'kde-workspace-bin.install'
[05:59] <philwyett> Also the file 'usr/lib/kde4/kded_ktouchpadenabler.so' is listed in the 'kde-workspace-bin.install' file.
[08:19] <soee> good morning
=== Quintasan_ is now known as Quintasan
[09:57] <allee> yofel_: thx for your support and uploading!
[10:18] <Riddell> < allee> Mhmm, when a lib is GPL 2+, then  the code using the lib can't be LGPL 2.1+, right?
[10:18] <Riddell> allee: it's all the same linking chain so there's no difference
[10:18] <Riddell> it's fine to do that
[10:29]  * allee ponders
[10:32] <allee> Wouldn't this allow to wrap any GPL2 code with open source LGPL layer and than link to the LGPL wrapper.  As LGPL allows linking without forceing to open source it,  closed source code could make use of any GPL  code it likes
[10:36] <tsimpson> it could only make use of the wrapper, not the GPL code directly
[10:37] <tsimpson> like how Qt can use GPLd libs, but still be LGPL
[10:49] <Riddell> "GPL2 code with open source LGPL layer" the result would be GPL
[10:49] <Riddell> because GPL linked with LGPL makes GPL
[10:56] <mikhas> you'd need process separation to avoid that problem
[11:00] <Riddell> s/avoid that problem/do an evil work around to avoid freedom/ :)
[11:00] <kubotu> Riddell: You did something wrong... Try s/you/me/ or tell me "help sed"
[11:11] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[12:02] <yofel_> Riddell: as you were the one that originally disabled sanitizeBranch() in kubuntu-initial-upload, please review if this works for you: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~kubuntu-packagers/+junk/kubuntu-automation/revision/119
[12:05] <Riddell> ok will take a look in a bit
[12:21] <Peace-pavillion> mmm installig 13.04 from mini iso = fail 
[12:21] <Peace-pavillion> :D some error selecting kde full 
[12:21] <Peace-pavillion> o kubuntu full
[12:23] <Riddell> does it say what error?
[12:24] <Peace-pavillion> display is not set
[12:24] <Peace-pavillion> :D
[12:24] <Peace-pavillion> i am trying to set but i did not work 
[12:24] <Peace-pavillion> :D
[12:25] <Peace-pavillion> it*
[12:27] <Peace-pavillion> mmm lightdm started but... doens't work funny cuz i am writing from 13.04 from another computer
[12:29] <Peace-pavillion> :D wtf i forgot to install xserver-xorg-video-intel 
[12:30] <Peace-pavillion> Riddell: btw if you use mini iso and select kde-full or kubuntu ful  i don't remember well it doesn't install the proper driver ?
[12:31] <Peace-pavillion> infact installing that package video-intell it started 
[12:54] <allee> Riddel, tsimpson: summarizing:  LGPL using GPL stuff is allowed, but as result is GPL, it makes not much sense because every user of the LGPL code is forced to obey the GPL, right?
[12:55] <apachelogger> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kde4libs/+bug/1099508
[12:55] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1099508 in kde4libs (Ubuntu) "missing FindHUpnp.cmake file" [Undecided,New]
[12:57] <apachelogger> allee: makes sense from a code perspective
[12:57] <apachelogger> the LGPL pieces are only GPL as part of the work that contains the GPL code
[12:57] <apachelogger> i.e. the binary
[12:58] <apachelogger> source-wise they are still different code pieces, so I could go ahead and take a function from the LGPL code and put it into LGPL Qt
[13:01] <apachelogger> allee: it's pretty much the thing why companies don't like GPL  ... if they were to include GPL code in a product and publish that they'd have created a GPL licensed binary thus required to also publish the GPL containing code of the binary artifact
[13:02] <apachelogger> (suffice to say there are ways to work around that... one of them being containing the GPL code in a *runtime loaded* *not necessary* plugin 
[13:03] <apachelogger> then the GPL code is no longer part of the larger binary and one would only need to release the unaltered GPL code + whatever is used to create the plugin portion
[13:08] <apachelogger> Peace-: ping
[13:08] <apachelogger> anyone with raring around?
[13:09] <BluesKaj> apachelogger, yup 
[13:10] <BluesKaj> managed to get it installed yesterday , still configuring stuff
[13:11] <apachelogger> BluesKaj: what's the output of apt-cache rdepends xserver-xorg-video-all
[13:14] <shadeslayer> wheee
[13:14] <shadeslayer> we have an armhf ppa now
[13:14] <apachelogger> oh
[13:14] <apachelogger> virtual? :O
[13:14] <shadeslayer> yes
[13:14] <apachelogger> cool
[13:15] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+question/219278
[13:15] <apachelogger> fabo: what's the roadmap for qt5 btw
[13:15] <apachelogger> neato
[13:15] <philwyett> Riddell: Have you addressed the ktouchpadenabler issue in raring from the last update?
[13:16] <apachelogger> oh actually someone asked me about active3 the other day
[13:16] <apachelogger> who as it? :O
[13:16]  * apachelogger has 300 queries open
[13:17] <yofel_> the ppa has some active3 build, shadeslayer will know more
[13:17] <yofel_> shadeslayer: go rebuild PA3 as a test ;P
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[13:18] <apachelogger> PA3?
[13:18]  * apachelogger notes that one is not to use PA for plasma active while apachelogger is around as PA is something different
[13:18] <yofel> Plasma-Active 3
[13:18] <yofel> for other interpretations of PA see channel backlog of yesterday evenign
[13:19] <shadeslayer> hehe
[13:19] <shadeslayer> I'll upload later tonight
[13:19] <apachelogger> so at least two morons fell for your misuse of PA :P
[13:19] <apachelogger> I'd rethink your acronym
[13:19] <BluesKaj> apachelogger,  http://pastebin.com/fbwh0afe
[13:20] <apachelogger> BluesKaj: thanks
[13:20] <apachelogger> so it makes no sense that peace- had the intel driver not installed
[13:20] <BluesKaj> apachelogger, np
[13:20] <apachelogger> as kubuntu-desktop should depend on xserver-xorg one way or another and that depends on all drivers and that depends on intel
[13:22] <yofel> lightdm recommends xserver-xorg, that's how it gets pulled in usually I think
[13:22] <BluesKaj> apachelogger, I have no xorg file , using nvidia 310.19 driver on 8400gs card
[13:23]  * apachelogger notes that using nvidia binary blob before release is mostly a bad idea
[13:23] <apachelogger> or say before rc
[13:23] <yofel> the blob works fine
[13:23] <apachelogger> ok
[13:24] <yofel> (as long as you use the right one)
[13:24] <apachelogger> BluesKaj: anywho, xorg configs are not necessary when autodetection works fine
[13:24] <apachelogger> such that it creates the config in-memory when loading the driver
[13:24] <apachelogger> in case that is what you meant ;)
[13:24] <apachelogger> yofel: as long as they don't break ABI :P
[13:24] <apachelogger> which usually happens around beta I think
[13:25] <apachelogger> ah yes
[13:25] <apachelogger> tomahawk 0.6 building
[13:25] <apachelogger> yofel: I upgraded jreen to 1.1.1 btw
[13:25] <yofel> well, we can blame the Ubuntu-X folks for pushing new X right before beta then
[13:25] <yofel> ah good
[13:25] <yofel> oh, new tomahaw, wheee
[13:26] <apachelogger> yofel: yeah, just saying, I prefer not having broken X over having broken X so I usually use the free drivers until rc
[13:26] <Riddell> philwyett: next on the todo list is htat
[13:26] <apachelogger> tho now all my systems are intel again, so not needed anymore :D
[13:26] <apachelogger> intel ftw
[13:26] <apachelogger> also intel drver not so much :S
[13:27] <yofel> no comment on intel. As for nouveau the performance is similiar to intel and I can't use my DisplayPort with nouveau
[13:27] <philwyett> Riddell: Ok
[13:31] <BluesKaj> yofel, i just ran nvidia-xconfig for safety's sake 
[13:32] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: so that buildtime <4hrs is a constraint for arm ppa?
[13:32] <shadeslayer> yes
[13:34] <apachelogger> but how would you know considering you cannot build with arm? :D :D
[13:48] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: whut?
[13:51] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: I just estimated from archive builds
[13:59] <apachelogger> but what if one wants to do that for a package that is not actually in archive
[13:59] <shadeslayer> then you check it on the arm farm
[13:59] <shadeslayer> that ScottK has
[14:00] <ScottK> Which would work faster if apachelogger would re-enable the ice creaming.
[14:02] <shadeslayer> well .. atleast have a super fast way of updating plasma active now
[14:02] <apachelogger> !
[14:02] <apachelogger> I looked into that
[14:02] <apachelogger> and something was a astray
[14:02] <apachelogger> and you were not around
[14:02] <apachelogger> or perhaps it is all set up
[14:15] <shadeslayer> whoop whoop whoop https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-active/+archive/ppa/+build/4222034
[14:17] <yofel> shadeslayer++
[14:21] <Riddell> awooga
[14:21] <Riddell> shadeslayer: so what's the status of active 3 packages?
[14:22] <Riddell> cos I see active 4 is in progress :)
[14:23] <shadeslayer> hehe
[14:23] <shadeslayer> well
[14:24] <shadeslayer> now that we have armhf packages we can ask people to test them on their N7's
[14:24] <shadeslayer> but it's mostly done
[14:24] <shadeslayer> I think I need to update the rules a bit to point to the Active 3 branch
[14:24] <Riddell> but what's stopping it being uploaded to the archive?
[14:25] <shadeslayer> nothing apart from QA and updating rules
[14:25] <shadeslayer> I have no idea if it works
[14:25] <shadeslayer> because I haven't tested it at all
[14:25] <Riddell> well does it work on your laptop?
[14:25] <shadeslayer> didn't test, because I was working on other stuff after uploading it :(
[14:26] <Riddell> interesting way of development :)
[14:26] <Riddell> didn't you compile it locally and test?
[14:26] <shadeslayer> I did, but did not test :P
[14:28] <Riddell> "it compiles so it must work" :)
[14:28] <shadeslayer> haha :D
[14:30] <apachelogger> it's the way of the shades
[14:52] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: why n7 btw?
[15:09] <Quintasan> Honestly I have no idea whatsover as to why I passed Algebra
[15:09] <shadeslayer> heh
[15:09] <Quintasan> ABSLOUTELY no idea.
[15:10] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: magic
[15:10] <shadeslayer> apachelogger: no particular reason, it's just that alot of people in here seem to have an N7
[15:10] <shadeslayer> and there's atleast some kind of support from Canonical for it
[15:10] <Quintasan> First exercise was some equations with parameters magic - I was supposed to solve it using Gauss method but I failed somewhere in the middle
[15:12] <apachelogger> shadeslayer: ah
[15:12] <apachelogger> doesn't it run android?
[15:12] <apachelogger> :P
[15:12] <Riddell> yofel: that kubuntu-automation change looks fine at a glance, well get a chance to test it out tomorrow I guess :)
[15:13] <Quintasan> oh my god
[15:13] <Riddell> apachelogger: there are ways of putting ubuntu on it and we hope to have images built soon (we hoped this in october)
[15:13] <apachelogger> I suppose I was trolling that fact :P
[15:13] <Quintasan> How on earth did he grade that, I've pulled pure BS in the third question and it was apparently correct.
[15:13] <yofel> Riddell: if it doens't poke me and I'll try to fix it - but simply turning that check off means loosing the out-of-sync-with-archive check for the branches
[15:14] <apachelogger> Quintasan: when I was TA it regularly happened that a grade ended up in the wrong column :P
[15:14] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-devel&m=135828074517081&w=2
[15:14] <apachelogger> unfortunately for the students I then checked and double checked :P
[15:14] <Quintasan> Riddell: Should things go as good as today we should have maliit-frameworks this Friday
[15:14] <Riddell> reminder: reviews needed for simon and oyranos packages in https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/experimental/+packages
[15:14] <Riddell> Quintasan: excellent :)
[15:14] <Quintasan> apachelogger: Thing is, I've got the paper back and he really gave me 5/5 points there
[15:15] <apachelogger> spooky
[15:15] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: I've found that it helps if you just go with it :P
[15:15] <Quintasan> It was pure (excuse my poor wording) bullshit
[15:15] <apachelogger> if it had been calculus I could explain it :P
[15:16] <Quintasan> shadeslayer: This ml post seems like another fail project ( see plasma-widget-kimpanel )
[15:16] <apachelogger> Quintasan: kimpanel was fail?
[15:17] <Quintasan> But this one might actually work out in case the user has fcitx installed since the developer himself is doing that
[15:17] <shadeslayer> Quintasan: I just wanted you to be informed about it, I don't know anything about input methods to give an opinion
[15:17] <Quintasan> apachelogger: Try running that in clean jp_JP install
[15:17] <Quintasan> or cn_CN for that matter
[15:17] <apachelogger> so it's bugged?
[15:17] <Quintasan> Does it even have a maintainer?
[15:18] <apachelogger> isn't it in workspace?
[15:18] <Quintasan> Riddell: You need to tell me how to modify langpacks and not break anything if we want $ASIANLANG input method to work by default
[15:18] <Quintasan> apachelogger: No idea. I don't really care now.
[15:19] <apachelogger> lol
[15:19] <apachelogger> also why modify langpacks?
[15:19] <apachelogger> or to what end result
[15:19] <Quintasan> apachelogger: Input methods by default my friend
[15:19]  * apachelogger shoudl go buy dinner or soemthing or nothing as people refuse to talk to him today
[15:19] <apachelogger> Quintasan: stop talking nonesense
[15:19] <Quintasan> Wah,
[15:19] <apachelogger> so what would you modify to get there?
[15:20] <Quintasan> Go and install Kubuntu in some asian language and tell me inputting those symbols works.
[15:20] <apachelogger> I fail to see the connection between a package providiing language files and localization TBH
[15:20] <Riddell> Quintasan: lp:~kubuntu-packagers/kubuntu-packaging/kde-l10n-common/  script build-l10n.sh
[15:20] <Riddell> Quintasan: it's not very elegant I'm afraid
[15:20] <apachelogger> dude
[15:20] <Quintasan> apachelogger: chinese langpack for example should pull ibus-pinyin
[15:20] <Riddell> Quintasan: down at bottom it says cd language-pack-kde-$ubuntudep/debian/
[15:20] <apachelogger> it's the most elegant bash you'll ever see
[15:21] <Riddell> so there about you need to put in something to add whatever new dependencies you want
[15:21] <apachelogger> it even has pointers!!#@!
[15:21] <apachelogger> Quintasan: so it is a matter of dependencies?
[15:21] <Riddell> Quintasan: correction, it's the most elegant bash you'll ever see.  but nevertheless, it is bash.
[15:21] <Quintasan> Riddell: Okay, I see. I will try doing it this weekend to, will push to bzr if it works.
[15:21] <yofel> apachelogger: where the hell do you have pointers in there?!?
[15:22] <apachelogger> RTFC
[15:22] <Quintasan> apachelogger: more or less, things get more complicated if you have locale other than the language you want input but that's not reallty interesting
[15:22] <apachelogger> case `eval "expr \"\$"$1"\" "` in
[15:23] <yofel> apachelogger: oh, the eval stuff?
[15:23] <yofel> heh
[15:23] <apachelogger> yus
[15:23] <apachelogger> pointers for bash
[15:23] <apachelogger> I had a nerdgasm when I came up wiht that
[15:23] <apachelogger> it's so simple and yet so awesome
[15:23] <Quintasan> if locale is jp_JP and you install japanese lang pack then the langpack itself should pull ibus-anthy
[15:23]  * yofel tried to keep kubuntu-batch-backport non-nerd readable
[15:23] <Quintasan> same for other asian languages
[15:24] <Quintasan> yofel: You get negative points in apachelogger's nerdranking :P
[15:24] <apachelogger> yofel: that's why most bash looks like crippled crap :P
[15:24] <yofel> now you assume that I care about that :P
[15:24] <apachelogger> people not wanting to establish sane standards
[15:24] <yofel> apachelogger: IMO it looks rather sane
[15:24] <Quintasan> yofel: You don't? Oh well 
[15:24] <apachelogger> Quintasan: so, if it is just about dependencies it's easy to do
[15:25] <Quintasan> I'm NOT sure if adding deps will solve everything
[15:25] <apachelogger> Quintasan: in the template packaging you introduce another variable where you want the dependency
[15:25] <Quintasan> I have to add them, test it and only then we will see.
[15:25] <apachelogger> then you sub those in the build script
[15:25] <apachelogger> Quintasan: you can simply edit the deb for testing
[15:25] <apachelogger> should be faster(tm)
[15:26]  * Quintasan will advocate the switch to fcitx
[15:26] <Quintasan> fcitx > ibus
[15:26] <apachelogger> dpkg-deb -e foo.deb content
[15:26] <apachelogger> ah, nay, wrong
[15:26] <apachelogger> dpkg-deb -x foo.deb content
[15:27] <apachelogger> dpkg-deb -e foo.deb content/DEBIAN
[15:27] <apachelogger> then edit stuff in content/DEBIAN/
[15:27] <apachelogger> to build a new deb
[15:27] <apachelogger> dpkg-deb -b content bar.deb
[15:29] <apachelogger> Riddell: what's the calligra portion in build-l10n suppoesd to do?
[15:29] <apachelogger> ah, I see
[15:29] <apachelogger> spooky
[15:29] <apachelogger> Oo
[15:29] <apachelogger> Riddell, yofel: why not Recommends: calligra-l10n-$code?
[15:29] <apachelogger> this if there seems like a not very scalable idea
[15:30] <apachelogger> also the code seems to appear twice, for some reason
[15:30] <apachelogger> anywho
[15:30]  * yofel hasn't touched that
[15:31] <apachelogger> Quintasan: so to edit the entire magic ... you introduce a new variable in the meta packaging and then add a new sed to the bottom of build-l10n
[15:31] <apachelogger> sed -i "s/aaaUBUNTULANGDEPbbb/$ubuntudep/g" $dfile
[15:31] <apachelogger> like that
[15:32] <apachelogger> somehwere you'll need to map languages to additional deps
[15:32] <apachelogger> which you can do using the eval magic at the top of the file
[15:43] <afiestas> 2 days ago shadeslayer told me that there are virtuoso debug symbols now (they weren't a few days ago)
[15:43] <afiestas> how do I download them?
[15:43] <yofel> !dbgsym
[15:44] <ubottu> dbgsym is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash
[15:44] <yofel> go to the debug symbol packages part
[15:44] <yofel> afiestas: note that the debugging symbols are only avaliable on raring
[15:45] <afiestas> raring is 13.04, isn't it?
[15:45] <BluesKaj> afiestas, yes it is 
[15:46] <afiestas> can we have them for 12.10?
[15:48] <yofel> by adding a -dbg package and putting that in some PPA it would be possible I guess
[16:21] <sbivol> hi, I'm trying to build a custom ubuntu image with live-build and I have added the medibuntu archive to config/archives/medibuntu.list.chroot
[16:21] <sbivol> I've also added medibuntu.key.chroot in the same folder. lb build stops with an error: „GPG error: http://packages.medibuntu.com raring Release: The following signatures were invalid: NODATA 1 NODATA 2”
[16:21] <sbivol> what am I doing wrong?
[16:22] <Riddell> what's lb?
[16:22] <Riddell> what's the custom image?
[16:24] <sbivol> Riddell: „lb” is a wrapper for live-build programs. custom image is the custom Live ISO image I'm trying to build
[16:25] <sbivol> Riddell: this is the documentation that I'm folloowing: http://live.debian.net/manual/3.x/html/live-manual.en.html#368
[16:26] <Riddell> that's a debian tool, no idea if it'll work on ubuntu
[16:26] <Riddell> sbivol: is it a kubuntu remix you're making?
[16:26] <Riddell> shadeslayer might have pointers for that
[16:26] <shadeslayer> ohai
[16:26] <shadeslayer> ok so
[16:26] <Riddell> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization is the easy one to follow
[16:28] <sbivol> Riddell: yes, it's a Debin tool, but heavily ubuntu-oriented. I just thought that the official Kubuntu images are also built with live-build...
[16:28] <shadeslayer> they are
[16:28] <shadeslayer> kind of
[16:28] <sbivol> s/Debin/Debian
[16:29] <shadeslayer> the squashfs is built by live-build then handed over to some tool that creates the actual CD
[16:29] <shadeslayer> but live-build will suffice 
[16:29] <shadeslayer> sbivol: I recommend installing ubuntu-defaults-builder
[16:30] <sbivol> shadeslayer: is there a recipe for building an official Kubuntu image with live-build? at least to the squashfs stage
[16:30] <shadeslayer> nope, but I have a script to create Netrunner Images
[16:30] <shadeslayer> sbivol: see https://github.com/netrunner/live-build
[16:30] <shadeslayer> more specifically netrunner-image-builder.sh
[16:31] <shadeslayer> but that's heavily customized
[16:32] <shadeslayer> sbivol: I recommend installing ubuntu-defaults-builder and playing around with /usr/bin/ubuntu-defaults-image
[16:34] <sbivol> shadeslayer: thank you very much, netrunner-image-builder.sh is priceless
[16:34] <shadeslayer> np :)
[16:35] <shadeslayer> sbivol: if you get stuck, read the live-build manual :P
[16:35] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I did, but it only says „Add the keys to config/archive”, with no mention of the key format or troubleshooting 
[16:36] <shadeslayer> ah
[16:36] <shadeslayer> haha
[16:36] <sbivol> It's a key error, but I have no clue what exactly is wrong with the key, since I extracted it from the medibuntu-keyring package
[16:37] <shadeslayer> https://github.com/netrunner/live-build/blob/master/archives/medibuntu.key.chroot :P
[16:37] <shadeslayer> it was fun when I started out because the version of live-build in the archive was pretty old
[16:38] <shadeslayer> and then I asked cjwatson to updated lb and all hell broke loose because they changed the format
[16:38] <sbivol> yep, I have the exact same key
[16:38] <shadeslayer> so I had to redo everything
[16:39] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I see that the official documentation is up-to-date, but all the tutorials on the internet are not suitable for the current live-build
[16:39] <shadeslayer> yeah, the documentation is actually too new
[16:39] <sbivol> oh, and I'm trying to build raring :)
[16:40] <shadeslayer> sbivol: oh oh, if you're trying to build raring on anything but a precise machine it won't work
[16:40] <shadeslayer> so I recommend building in a raring chroot
[16:40] <sbivol> I'm doing raring on raring
[16:40] <shadeslayer> cool :)
[16:41] <shadeslayer> and the documentation on live.debian.net is for a different lb version than the one we have in Ubuntu
[16:41] <shadeslayer> and the ubuntu one has some customizations
[16:42] <shadeslayer> so if you find that the documentation has some feature while lb on your system doesn't really have, it's not a bug :P
[16:43] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I'll keep that in mind
[16:44] <Riddell> anyone got a windows 7 machine and able to test if ubiquity can detect the parition?  (from http://forums.netrunner-os.com/showthread.php?tid=134 )
[16:44]  * shadeslayer needs to figure out a better way to add multiarch to ISO's
[16:49] <Riddell> is anyone on raring able to apt-get install kubuntu-full ?
[16:50] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: hi
[16:50] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: i have windows 7
[16:50] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: have you installed kubuntu alongside it?
[16:50] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: no
[16:50] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: you mean dual boot?
[16:50] <Riddell> yeah
[16:50] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: ya
[16:50] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: 12.10
[16:51] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: also ubuntu 13.04
[16:51] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: and the partition option during install correctly identified the windows partition?
[16:51] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: for what verison?
[16:51] <Riddell> for 12.10
[16:51] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: 13.04 was an upgrade from 12.10
[16:52] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: 12.10 kubuntu , the partions where deteched normally?
[16:52] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: 12.10 kubuntu , the partions where deteched normally
[16:53] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: great thanks
[16:53] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: Do you want me to confirm ?
[16:53] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: if you already installed 12.10 alongside windows 7 there's nothing more to confirm
[16:53] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: cool
[16:54] <Riddell> although it's a mystery why that users had the issue and why the mint guy had the issue testing with kubuntu
[16:54] <shadeslayer> Riddell: nope
[16:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: nope what?
[16:54] <shadeslayer> cannot install kubuntu-full
[16:55] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: fails in between or doesnt start?
[16:55] <Riddell> shadeslayer: it's weird, it moans it can't install kde-workspace kubuntu-desktop
[16:55] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: does  sudo apt-get install kubuntu-full  work or break?
[16:55] <Riddell> (no need to install it, just does it let you)
[16:55] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: checking
[16:55] <Riddell> shadeslayer: but if I do  sudo apt-get install kubuntu-full kde-workspace kubuntu-desktop plasma-widgets-addons
[16:55] <Riddell> it works fine
[16:56] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: unmet dependencies 
[16:56] <shadeslayer> O_O
[16:56] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: can you pastebin the output?
[16:56] <shadeslayer> http://paste.kde.org/648728/
[16:57] <shadeslayer> Riddell: more fun, kubuntu-full the task will install fine
[16:57] <shadeslayer> sudo apt-get install kubuntu-full^
[16:57] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: http://paste.kde.org/648734/
[16:58] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: yes same as me.  thanks
[16:59] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: forgot to tell you , i have beta ppas enabled
[16:59] <yofel> hm, in a raring chroot I get (with -proposed on if that matters):
[16:59] <yofel> The following packages have unmet dependencies:
[16:59] <yofel>  kubuntu-full : Depends: kdegames but it is not going to be installed
[16:59] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: yw
[17:01] <yofel> which is because kmahjongg was rejected on i386 so nevermind
[17:01] <Riddell> mm, was it?
[17:01] <yofel> Riddell: does it fail with kubuntu-desktop already installed, or?
[17:02] <yofel> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+source/kmahjongg/4:4.9.97-0ubuntu2
[17:02] <yofel> as in a plain raring chroot (without proposed), kubuntu-full seems to install fine
[17:03] <Riddell> smelly old archive admin rejected it without telling me why
[17:04] <sbivol> shadeslayer: I see that in netrunner-image-builder.sh you use „config/archives/ubuntu-defaults.chroot.list” instead of „config/archives/ubuntu-defaults.list.chroot”. The docs specify the second naming scheme. Is there a reason for that?
[17:05] <shadeslayer> errr ... did they change it *again*
[17:05] <shadeslayer> it was foo.list.chroot earlier
[17:05] <shadeslayer> then they changed it to foo.chroot.list
[17:09] <shadeslayer> sbivol: just go with foo.list :P
[17:10] <sbivol> doh... confusing.
[17:12] <shadeslayer> yeah
[17:16] <jussi> wow
[17:17] <jussi> dunno who made that nice new wallpaper, but WOW
[17:17] <shadeslayer> which wallpaper?
[17:17] <Riddell> the lovely oxygen team
[17:17] <Riddell> come to fosdem and you can get a snazzy name sticker with the same
[17:17] <jussi> http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/16/plasma-desktopb21967.png
[17:18] <jussi> shadeslayer: ^^
[17:18] <shadeslayer> ah Elarun
[17:19] <shadeslayer> and yes, it's extremely awesome :D
[17:19] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell:kubuntu-full can be installed now after an updating
[17:19] <sbivol> btw, regarding the wallpaper: with KDE 4.10 on Kubuntu 12.10, the images used for lightdm, greeter and desktop background are the same, but look very different
[17:19] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: updatingkksysguard
[17:19] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: updating ksysguard
[17:20] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: http://paste.kde.org/648746/
[17:20] <sbivol> the difference being in the way they are rendered. for example, the desktop background is very smooth, while the lightdm background has rough curves
[17:36] <Riddell> bah, usb-creator-kde needs python3-ising
[17:44] <xnox> whoops =/
[17:44]  * xnox thought i did do it, did I not?!
[17:44] <xnox> althought I only just fixed a bug in the helper script....
[17:48] <Riddell> xnox: maybe you did, I'm testing from bzr now, but it's running very very slow
[17:48] <Riddell> i.e. taking a very long time to copy an image to my usb stick
[17:48] <xnox> Riddell: currently there is "sync" remount option in the raring package that I need to revert. as it's way too slow.
[17:52] <Riddell> xnox: ./bin/usb-creator-kde in bzr uses /usr/bin/python and works fine but /usr/bin/usb-creator-kde in version 0.2.43 uses /usr/bin/python3 and breaks
[17:52] <Riddell> does something change the header to /usr/bin/python3 at package build time?
[18:01] <xnox> yes. dh_python3.
[18:01] <xnox> Riddell: do you not want python3? or you just want it to work?
[18:03] <Riddell> xnox: python 3 is fine, I'll look at porting it, will be interesting to learn how to do that
[18:03] <kubotu> ::workspace-bugs:: [1100377] package ktouchpadenabler 4:4.9.97-0ubuntu2 failed to install/upgrade: intentando sobreescr... @ https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1100377 (by mercuriete)
[18:03] <Riddell> xnox: but could you tell me how to stop the sync mount option?  cos an hour to make an image isn't going to help my testing speed :)
[18:05] <xnox> Riddell: look for ",sync" in the /usr/share/usb-creator/usb-creator-helper
[18:05] <xnox> and remove it.
[18:05] <Riddell> hmm, tried that, still mounts it with sync
[18:05] <xnox> Riddell: kill the spawned dangling helper on the dbus....
[18:05] <xnox> Riddell: make sure a new one is spawned....
[18:06] <Riddell> that it, thanks xnox
