[00:19] <rick_h_> http://securityblog.verizonbusiness.com/2013/01/14/case-study-pro-active-log-review-might-be-a-good-idea/ ok, lmao
[00:20] <JonEdney> lol
[00:20] <JonEdney> My work would love to hear that, spend all day reviewing SSH logs.
[00:37] <Blazeix> well, i'm quitting Awesome
[00:37] <rick_h_> Blazeix: where to?
[00:37] <rick_h_> or what did they do to you?
[00:37] <Blazeix> version 3.5 pulled another "hey let's change the config file format agin"
[00:37] <rick_h_> or both
[00:37] <rick_h_> bah!
[00:37] <Blazeix> so i'm switching herbstluftwm
[00:37] <Blazeix> the only downside is i need to copy paste that name
[00:37] <rick_h_> yea, still on 3.4.13 here
[00:37] <rick_h_> du what?!
[00:37] <Blazeix> yeah...
[00:38] <Blazeix> tried xmonad and wmfs first, but wasn't a fan
[00:38] <rick_h_> well, I'll be curious to check out your setup at CHC
[00:38]  * rick_h_ checks what's going to be in 13.04
[00:38] <Blazeix> herbstluftwm out-of-the-box is how i was trying to configure xmonad and wmfs
[00:39] <rick_h_> yea, why I liked awesome. My config is so small. Really just defining the number of spaces and keyboard shortcuts
[00:39] <rick_h_> hmm, looks like raring is still 3.4.14
[00:40] <rick_h_> so maybe I'll have time to do it when I want vs forced into it. But maybe it's time to give xmonad that shot I kept promising I would
[00:40] <rick_h_> man, you thought saying you used "Awesome" was bad...herbstluftwm is full of suck
[00:40] <Blazeix> herbstluftwm just uses dzen for the bar, so i'm trying to convince myself that i can just finally learn dzen then bring it with me to future wms
[00:40] <Blazeix> at least it's googleable
[00:41] <Blazeix> i suppose wmii would be the way to go for a less sucky name
[00:41] <Blazeix> (har!)
[00:49] <rick_h_> hah
[00:50] <rick_h_> hmm, the screenshots are kind of strange. Tiling but not tiling
[00:50] <rick_h_> bah, who sees wallpaper in a tiling wm? that seems broken. :P
[00:50] <Blazeix> yeah, you can do the whole 'manual tiling' thing if you want
[00:50] <Blazeix> right now i'm just ignoring that
[00:50] <rick_h_> ah, ok
[02:06] <snap-l> OK, what the hell is a herbstluftwm?
[02:06] <snap-l> Seriously, I think I could come up with a better name from a scrabble board and boggle cubes.
[02:07] <snap-l> "Hey, have you heard of my new software? It's calle drufflebuttskin"
[02:08] <brousch1> Awesome! Where can I buy it?
[02:08] <snap-l> Form me on my new github alternative gitflorpanshits
[02:16] <Blazeix> it apparently means 'autumn air' in german
[02:21] <brousch1> I often turn to the German language to describe relaxing and pleasant things
[02:28] <Blazeix> brousch1++
[13:11] <rick_h_> ok, lost any interest in google glass now http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=047lMUJMo8Y
[13:12] <snap-l> rick_h_: No tiling windowmanager?
[13:12] <rick_h_> guess not :P
[13:12] <brousch> I'm sure Canonical is working on UbuntuMonacle or something
[13:18] <snap-l> Man, her head bounces more than Evil Otto
[13:18] <rick_h_> lol
[13:18] <rick_h_> it's a bit creepy, and definitely not liking the look of a room full of glass wearers
[13:19] <snap-l> I'm not sure they could make this look more like a SNL skit
[13:19] <brousch> It's just  a phase. It will displace phones. Then contact lenses will displace the glasses
[13:19] <snap-l> I'm just wondering where the uncomfortable laughter fits in
[13:20] <rick_h_> heh, so this is the phone version of that old brick phone?
[13:20] <rick_h_> meh, I'll go with the watch over glass atm
[13:20] <snap-l> rick_h_: When we're all brains in jars, you'll look on this day fondly.
[13:20] <brousch> You will look silly with your arm in front of your face as you watch a movie
[13:21] <rick_h_> lol, maybe so I guess
[13:21] <snap-l> brousch: You'll look even more silly when you walk off a cliff while watching a movie on glass.
[13:21] <brousch> Who walks? I'll be driving off a cliff
[13:21] <snap-l> rick_h_: Would you bring that ball chair tonight?
[13:22] <rick_h_> snap-l: rgr, let me move it out of the office up by the door
[13:22] <snap-l> brousch: while watching Thelma and Louise, no doubt.
[13:22] <snap-l> Thank you, sir. :)
[13:22] <brousch> Ball chair? Is that a tiny chair for your balls?
[13:22] <snap-l> Yes, it's the standing desk for my nuts
[13:22] <rick_h_> lmao
[13:23] <brousch> apparently I need to watch more late-night QVC
[13:24] <snap-l> brousch: Nah, they featured it on The Today Show.
[13:24] <snap-l> "Oh wow, this really is more ergonomic"
[13:24] <rick_h_> well it's less a chair and just an excercise ball
[13:25] <rick_h_> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017W2CLU/ref=wms_ohs_product
[13:25] <rick_h_> vs http://www.amazon.com/Gaiam-Balance-Ball-Chair-Black/dp/B0007VB4NE/ref=sr_1_1?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1358342708&sr=1-1&keywords=ball+chair'
[13:25] <rick_h_> well, minux the ' at the end
[13:25] <snap-l> Ah, OK
[13:25] <brousch> Ah, one of those. Dwight Shrute had one
[13:25] <snap-l> rick_h_: I just hope Pixel doesn't get bored, and stick a claw in it
[13:26] <brousch> Now I want one
[13:26] <rick_h_> snap-l: it's pretty tough. I used to play with the boy with it
[13:26] <snap-l> 65cm?
[13:27] <rick_h_> yea
[13:27] <rick_h_> think so
[13:27] <snap-l> OK.
[13:27]  * snap-l puts one on rick_h_'s gift list (really wondering how the cat will handle this)
[17:39] <greg-g> ok, next time I buy new headphones, I'm getting ones with a coiled cord
[18:23] <snap-l> Yet another reminder of why I'll never buy another logitech keyboard ever again
[18:23] <snap-l> Pried off the space bar on the keyboard, and now I can't get it back on
[18:23] <snap-l> so now I'm using an old Apple keyboard.
[18:24] <snap-l> Argh
[18:25] <snap-l> Has not been a particularly good technology day so far
[18:25] <jcastro> heh, I love my logitech kb
[18:26] <snap-l> I did too
[18:26] <snap-l> Now I have to get used to this keyboard, which feels very mushy
[18:26] <snap-l> got used to the chicklet feeling
[18:27] <brousch> snap-l: I knew you'd relapse!
[18:31] <snap-l> brousch: hush
[18:31] <snap-l> My PSU is making noise, my keboard is off...
[18:31] <snap-l> My computer zen is shaken
[18:33] <brousch> I'm about due for my 6 month OSX relapse, but I actually don't feel it coming on this time
[18:33] <brousch> Maybe because I am still running 12.04
[18:36] <rick_h_> snap-l: you need me to bring some kb samples to CHC too?
[18:51] <widox> speaking of keyboards...
[18:51] <widox> rick_h_: you get the filco in yet?
[18:52] <rick_h_> widox: yep, been using it this week
[18:53] <rick_h_> much better feel than the leopold
[18:53] <rick_h_> nice to be back on a 10less
[18:54] <widox> anymore double keypresses?
[18:54] <rick_h_> fewer. I think I might have one a day now
[18:54] <widox> huh
[18:55] <brousch> Lay off the coffee
[18:55] <rick_h_> hah
[18:55] <rick_h_> widox: want me to bring it tonight?
[18:55] <widox> ooh, sure.
[18:55] <widox> did you end up getting a new wrist pad yet?
[18:55] <rick_h_> yea
[18:55] <rick_h_> have the leather wrist pad
[18:55] <widox> the filco one?
[18:56] <widox> was going to bring mine out, if you wanted to check it out
[18:56] <rick_h_> http://elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=access,palm_rests&pid=hm_prlb
[18:56] <rick_h_> sure thing, I'll bring mine and we can compare. I'm not 100% sold on it. It's really solid.
[18:56] <rick_h_> used to that gel one with some give, but we'll see
[18:57] <widox> ah, it looks pretty similar to that one
[18:58] <snap-l> rick_h_: If you'd bring that brown keyboard by, I wouldn't mind having another go at it.
[18:59] <rick_h_> snap-l: well I've got an old logitech, the rest will be too loud I think
[18:59] <rick_h_> widox: has the cherry brown leopold now
[18:59] <widox> buwhaa
[19:00] <snap-l> Oh, nuts. :)
[19:01] <snap-l> No worries then. ;)
[19:09] <snap-l> rick_h_: You just have Cherry Blue switches, then, right?
[19:09] <rick_h_> yea, I've got two keyboards now with cherry blues, and the unicomp.
[19:09] <rick_h_> unless you're interested in a MS natural split, have a couple of those
[19:10] <snap-l> Nah, that's OK. I hate split keyboards.
[19:10] <rick_h_> yea, didn't think you did
[19:10] <rick_h_> but I do have an old logitech normal cheapo keyboard if yuo need
[19:11] <snap-l> Nah, I think I'm good.
[19:11] <rick_h_> ok
[19:11] <snap-l> Though if you accidentlly brought a Blue by... ;)
[19:11] <rick_h_> hah ok.
[19:11] <snap-l> Thank you. :)
[19:13] <widox> KB party!
[19:20] <snap-l> Heh
[20:55] <snap-l> mutt
[20:55] <snap-l> bah
[21:02] <Blazeix> mutts go woof, snap-l.
[21:04] <jhansonxi> mutts are better than pure-breds, IMOH
[21:12] <snap-l> heh
[21:12] <jrwren> mmmm. bread
[21:12] <jrwren> fresh baked bread nom nom
[21:13] <snap-l> Yeah, I like mutts, mostly because I can relate.
[21:13] <snap-l> jrwren: Bread Machines FTW
[21:13] <jrwren> nah, not nearly as good as what you can do by hand
[21:14] <snap-l> Really, so you can mow the lawn while making bread. I'm impressed. ;)
[21:14]  * snap-l imagines jrwren cleans clothes by hand too. ;)
[21:15] <brousch> Clean them? He just knits new ones every time
[21:17] <snap-l> jrwren: I've got just the thing for you: http://ur1.ca/cjpe0
[21:18] <brousch> geesz. expensive
[21:19] <brousch> Could build your own for less
[21:23] <snap-l> I figured if I was using an affiliate link, I'd go with the most expensive one. ;)
