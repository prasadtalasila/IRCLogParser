=== czajkowski changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: catch up wth the loco council
[21:04] <czajkowski> so we don't have anything on our agenda
[21:04] <czajkowski> but seeing as we're here lets just catch up
[21:04] <SergioMeneses> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LoCoCouncil/Agenda
[21:05] <czajkowski> SergioMeneses: we;re doing that team via bug no ?
[21:05] <SergioMeneses> only the Ubuntu Iranian team, but they want to work on the bug
[21:05] <SergioMeneses> yes czajkowski
[21:05] <czajkowski> grand
=== czajkowski changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: Alternative word to - Approved - for loco teams
[21:06] <czajkowski> so I've seen this come up on various blog posts in comments
[21:06] <czajkowski> how people feel unmotivated due to them not being an Approved locoo and how really that word doesnt really help motvate people in getting more involved
[21:07] <czajkowski> what I'd like to do is look at if there is an alternative and see if could be used
[21:07] <czajkowski> sometimes words in english don't always translate so clearly in other languages
[21:07] <SergioMeneses> sure, like free
[21:08] <czajkowski> so I just want to see if this is possible and it also may not be. But if we don't discuss it then well we'll never know
[21:08] <czajkowski> so some alternaives that kinda spring to mind are
[21:08] <czajkowski> Sponsored loco - downsides would people may assume un approved locos would lose hosting, email etc as they are not sponsored, when they would be
[21:09] <czajkowski> if anyone has any ideas please feel free to jump in
[21:09] <SergioMeneses> I was thinking on "official" or "sponsored"
[21:09] <czajkowski> I do like offical as that is a clear word and is less black and white
[21:09] <BobJonkman2> Hi, I'm Bob Jonkman from the Canadian Team, which has recently lost its "approved" status.
[21:09] <czajkowski> verified would also be a good one
[21:09] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: hi there
[21:10] <czajkowski> REviewed would also be good
[21:10] <SergioMeneses> and Bhavani said Sponsored or Authorised
[21:10] <czajkowski> so they are reviewed by the council
[21:10] <czajkowski> Authroised sounds a bit severe imo, but again that's just me
[21:10] <SergioMeneses> sure
[21:10] <czajkowski> and I'm trying to find a way to sum what up approved is, but also make it sound less harsh
[21:10] <czajkowski> huats: any ideas
[21:11] <SergioMeneses> it is a strong word
[21:11] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: any ideas there?
[21:11] <BobJonkman2> loss of approval has caused some agitation amongst team members.  There is some feeling that we're not allowed to gather and have events focused on Ubuntu without approval.  A different word would be welcome
[21:11] <huats> honnestly I have thought about that and approved is the best word for me
[21:11] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: why do people feel that way, we have many teams who don't have the approved status and all have events
[21:11] <czajkowski> huats: nods
[21:12] <huats> I don't llike sponsored nor authorised (team can exists without being approved)
[21:12] <czajkowski> Again, just like to point out, nothing is set in stone. it's jsut stuff I've seen and heard from many people and discussion is good.
[21:12] <czajkowski> huats: nods
[21:12] <BobJonkman2> It's the word, "Approved".  Without "approval" the sense is that activities are disapproved
[21:12] <czajkowski> what I had in my head Loco teams ( unapproved) and reviewed loco teams (approved)
[21:13] <czajkowski> taking away the unapproved and approved words
[21:13] <czajkowski> so all teams are locoteams
[21:13] <czajkowski> but one of which has been reviewed by the council
[21:13] <czajkowski> so seems offical
[21:13] <czajkowski> but also less harsh
[21:13] <czajkowski> thoughts?
[21:13] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: never heard that but interesting to think about
[21:14] <BobJonkman2> The only direct benefit the Canadian Team sees to an "Approved" status is that Canonical provides branded Ubuntu disks (which are very welcome, and show proprietary software users that Ubuntu is not just some fly-by-night thing)
[21:14] <czajkowski> nods
[21:14] <huats> I might try the word 'official' but nothing besides that
[21:14] <BobJonkman2> So perhaps a new word might focus on the benefits a Team receives.  "Sponsored" seems to work for that
[21:15] <SergioMeneses> huats, +1
[21:15] <SergioMeneses> BobJonkman2, huats czajkowski I think "official" would be better for this
[21:15] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: how would differenciate between sponsored and unsponsored then
[21:15] <SergioMeneses> imho
[21:15] <huats> BobJonkman2: I think there is something on what we can try to work : some teams (I am aware of ubuntu-fr and ubuntu-de) have agreement with Canonical to be able to sell ubuntu branded goodies
[21:16] <huats> I have been asked in the past by Jono to provide him that "agreement" so that he can work out on extending it to the rest of "approved" loco teams
[21:16] <czajkowski> So my only concern then would be for "unapproved" locos how seeing the word Sponsored and Offical not beside their team
[21:16] <BobJonkman2> From the Team members' perspective, the only thing we get out of "Approval" (or Sponsorship) is disks, which we give away gratis to anyone who is interested
[21:17] <czajkowski> and also the word Offical means what ?
[21:17] <czajkowski> any team not approved is not an offical team
[21:17] <czajkowski> I susupect our inboxes would explode in outrage
[21:17] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: makes a difference in conference packs also
[21:17] <czajkowski> which many teams use more so than CDs tbh
[21:17] <huats> this could be a real benefit to inform team that selling an ubuntu goodies without being approved is a copyright violation (and this is something people in FOSS are really looking carefully)
[21:17] <pleia2> there are sometimes also publishers who use approved/non-approved as criteria for giving out books (the official ubuntu book only went to approved teams)
[21:18] <czajkowski> also little known fact. Not many teams request the CD allocation each cycle
[21:18] <pleia2> so it's not even just canonical
[21:18] <BobJonkman2> czajkowski: True, but most members don't see the conference packs
[21:18] <BobJonkman2> and since the decline of Ontario Linuxfest 2 years ago we haven't had need of a conference pack
[21:18] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: my experience is the other way in fact
[21:18] <czajkowski> but nice to hear another side of things
[21:19] <czajkowski> well like I say nothing is fixed in stone, this is useful information and we'll follow up with a blog post and posting to the loco contacts list for wider discussion
[21:19] <BobJonkman2> czajkowski: That most members don't see the conference pack may be because the Canadian Team covers a large geographic region.
[21:20] <czajkowski> #action czajkowski write blog post and post to lococontacts on the subject
[21:20] <meetingology> ACTION: czajkowski write blog post and post to lococontacts on the subject
[21:20] <czajkowski> #topic Reviewed Large Geographic counteries for locoteam structure.
=== meetingology changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: Reviewed Large Geographic counteries for locoteam structure.
[21:20] <BobJonkman2> But smaller geographic regions would reduce active membership to a small handful in each region
[21:20] <czajkowski> So BobJonkman2 this may be of interest to your team
[21:21] <czajkowski> This has come up time and time again over the last year or so
[21:21] <BobJonkman2> :) That's one of the reasons I'm here
[21:21] <czajkowski> We have counteries such as India, Australia, Canada and Brazil
[21:21] <czajkowski> all of which are massive georgaphic regions and it's not possible to be loco in that sense
[21:22] <czajkowski> what we would propse is to break them up into state/provence like USA has done
[21:22] <czajkowski> and there can be locos that way
[21:23] <czajkowski> the reason we would like to do this now rather than in 1+years is to put in place measures to help teams from the ground up, but also helps plan and better allocate resouces when planning eg. Canonical DVDs
[21:23] <BobJonkman2> For the Canadian Team, a good geographic area is maybe 100km across.  Even members in a provincial team would be separated by hundreds of km
[21:23] <czajkowski> we've had this request in a number of times now from India and we've had to keep putting it off as we don't have the requirements in place.
[21:23] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: the same goes for many countereies and even states in the USA
[21:24] <czajkowski> what would also benefit is that the LTP would be able to have a section in the team page for a CITY contact
[21:24] <czajkowski> this merge has been ready for a long time as it was discussed at least 2 UDSs ago
[21:24] <BobJonkman2> +1 for City contacts
[21:24] <czajkowski> Brazil loco have already broken their team up into sub teams a long time ago , this would just help for making it offical
[21:25] <czajkowski> but if we don't set the standard up now, then it all becomes rather messy and has a knock on effect on other things, then such as Approved/offical locos
[21:25] <czajkowski> what do folks think?
[21:25] <SergioMeneses> but it doesnt work for all teams, russia said no
[21:26] <BobJonkman2> In Canadian Team IRC meetings the consensus is that provincial teams won't make much difference to members; our team groups are city-based
[21:26] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: right but in a provence you could have a city contact but not a city loco. this has been discussed at length at UDS and it was said no a city loco would not happen.
[21:27] <BobJonkman2> If Canada is split into provincial teams most members still would not meet face-to-face, and we'd probably continue to meet in IRC on a Canada-wide basis anyway.
[21:28] <BobJonkman2> So, splitting into provincial teams would create bureaucratic and administrative overhead that accomplishes nothing.
[21:28] <czajkowski> or it could help the team
[21:28] <czajkowski> the USA has a USA mentor team
[21:28] <czajkowski> we should try and be more encouraing about new ideas
[21:29] <czajkowski> rather than saying it wont work tbh
[21:30] <BobJonkman2> We're working on our Canadian Re-approval application now, and it's been difficult to get members working together in anything larger than a City.  Most of the discussion takes place during the Kitchener and Waterloo Ubuntu Hours, face-to-face
[21:31] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: you may not understand my point, break ing up teams into provence/state may encourage others to step up and if they dn't that's fine, but the standard is put in place
[21:31] <czajkowski> and the option is there for the future
[21:32] <BobJonkman2> True, more teams would mean more involvement from people as local contacts
[21:32] <czajkowski> yes exactly
[21:32] <czajkowski> as a person living the other side of canada may not be interested in an event in that area
[21:33] <czajkowski> but may be interested in running on in their provence
[21:33] <czajkowski> lets try adn support the idea and work out the logistics as we move forward
[21:33] <czajkowski> this idea has hit roadblocks from people for the last 18 months
[21:33] <SergioMeneses> anyways this is a sensible topic and we need a lot of ideas and commentaries
[21:33] <czajkowski> yet we keep getting requests on a monthly basis for help in this area
[21:34] <czajkowski> so I suspect we'll A) blog B) mail loco contacts and the teams we have in mind
[21:34] <czajkowski> over the coming week(s)
[21:34] <czajkowski> but it would be nice to get the ball rolling
[21:35] <SergioMeneses> czajkowski, I think is the best
[21:35] <czajkowski> so for example there are 10 provences in Canada
[21:35] <BobJonkman2> A team leader may run an event in her City, but as each province is about 1000km wide having provincial LoCos doesn't make much difference to having a country LoCo
[21:35] <czajkowski> you could have 10 locoteams there rather than one large country one
[21:35] <czajkowski> surely this makes more sense
[21:37] <BobJonkman2> We have about 300 members, spread out over more than 5000 km; most of them are in Ontario. A Saskatchewan LoCo may have only one or two members...
[21:37] <czajkowski> so my georgaphy of Canada is a bit sketchy apologies, but you'd have ubutu-ca-on for Ontario loco and a city contact on the LTP for Toronto
[21:37] <czajkowski> if I have my provence and city right there
[21:38] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: true but at least the two there would have the option and feel empowered to have a loco in their back ice skating rink! :)
[21:38]  * czajkowski has a mate there, it's very cold!
[21:38] <czajkowski> but they should have the option there to have their own loco
[21:38] <czajkowski> equally they can mail the mothership the candian team for advice and help and that team could mentor people
[21:39] <BobJonkman2> In Vancouver there is a city-based (unapproved) LoCo, that seems to work well for them.
[21:39] <SergioMeneses> like a meta team
[21:39] <BobJonkman2> But Toronto, with a population of about 5,000,000 doesn't even have Ubuntu Hours.
[21:39] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: each team is so different on their events
[21:40] <czajkowski> and like I said city contact was discussed at UDS and it was said No it would not happen, at best the LTP would be edited to allow for a city contact.
[21:40] <SergioMeneses> BobJonkman2, but what can we do in that case?
[21:40] <czajkowski> anwyasy this was just to give an idea of what the council are working on
[21:40] <BobJonkman2> If Canada should be split into provincial LoCos we would like to keep the country-wide mailing list, IRC channel &c. because of the sparse membership.
[21:41] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: thats not a problem this could be worked out n the future
[21:41] <czajkowski> it's not being decided this second
[21:41] <BobJonkman2> czajkowski: I understand.
[21:41] <czajkowski> #topic AOB

[21:44] <czajkowski> we dont always have such a free meeting
[21:44] <czajkowski> it's nice :)
[21:45] <BobJonkman2> If anything is to be done about LoCos, I'd like to know how to engage more people.  300 people in Ubuntu-ca out in an entire country is pretty abysmal.
[21:47] <czajkowski> BobJonkman2: it's not really
[21:47] <czajkowski> given peoples lives jobs and other stuff goig on
[21:47] <czajkowski> *going on
[21:47] <czajkowski> 300 is a lot still
