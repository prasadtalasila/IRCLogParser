[01:42] <everaldo> good night (or day)
[01:45] <darkxst> everaldo, day here ;)
[01:45] <everaldo> darkxst, hey... are you already using raring?
[01:46] <darkxst> yeh
[01:46] <darkxst> well some of it
[01:46] <everaldo> well, it look more stable than quantal here
[01:46] <everaldo> it looks
[01:47] <everaldo> darkxst, are you happy with nautilus?
[01:47] <darkxst> tbh I don't really use it alot so yes!
[01:47] <everaldo> man, I got crazy...so  patched it
[01:48] <everaldo> well, just 5 patches
[01:48] <everaldo> darkxst, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1533063/
[01:49] <darkxst> oh, I have 3.7.3
[01:50] <everaldo> darkxst, from where? sources?
[01:50] <darkxst> gnome3-staging ppa
[01:51] <everaldo> is the one that will be used for gnome-remix?
[01:55] <darkxst> well its the test ppa for gnome3 ppa , don't know if that will be included in the iso however
[01:56] <everaldo> darkxst, do you think that is a good idea try to submit my patches to raring?
[01:57] <darkxst> sure you can try
[01:58] <everaldo> also, will try to patch 3.7.3
[01:58] <darkxst> although I think they want to reduce the delta, not increase it!
[02:00] <everaldo> yes, I know... but it is a little hard to use the current Nautilus version
[02:01] <darkxst> atleast search is fixed
[02:01] <everaldo> yes, I saw
[02:02] <everaldo> but the missing expand list views (treeview) is something that really make me crazy
[02:02] <everaldo> it is ok remove it from sidebar but... for list view
[02:02] <everaldo> lots of more clicks to use nautilus
[02:03] <darkxst> guess I am old school, I tend to type the path
[02:08]  * everaldo thinking about GNOME3 Staging
[03:41] <jbicha> we likely won't get gnome-shell 3.8 in the regular gnome3 PPA this cycle, since it needs gnome-control-center/gnome-settings-daemon 3.8 and that won't be ready
[03:46] <darkxst> oh i see
[03:59] <jbicha> darkxst: when are you going to apply for Ubuntu membership?
[04:01] <darkxst> ah, soon
[04:01] <darkxst> the guys on the developer advisory team, said I should wait for a bit more
[04:01] <darkxst> and/or they would contact me again, when they think I am ready or something
[04:02] <darkxst> but also I have mainly been working upstream again given the current segmentation in ubuntu
[04:06] <jbicha> are you interested in packaging gnome 3.7.4 for the staging ppa?
[04:10] <darkxst> potentially could help out later in the week, bit busy today
[04:12] <jbicha> that's fine, there isn't a rush
[04:20] <darkxst> ok, I can do some packages
[09:26] <Mikel> Want to solve the problem of launch menu. Icons are not separated
[17:47] <ricotz> jbicha, hi, be aware that the tarballed configure.ac of g-s lies about the gjs dep
[17:51] <jbicha> ricotz: lies?
[17:52] <ricotz> it really needs gjs 1.35.4
[17:52] <jbicha> it's running here fine with gjs 1.35.3
[17:53] <jbicha> gjs 1.35.4 on the other hand isn't because I guess it needs a newer gobject-introspection
[17:53] <ricotz> jbicha, hmm, should get some js failures
[17:53] <ricotz> due missing cairo dispose methodes
[17:54] <ricotz> yeah, gjs probably needs the newer g-i too
[17:59] <jbicha> I wonder if I can get robert_ancell to package accountsservice 0.6.30 since g-c-c 3.7.4 needs it
[18:04] <ricotz> jbicha, libpeas would be nice too, since 1.6.2 isnt even in quantal/raring
[18:05] <ricotz> and 1.7.0 is needed
[18:07] <ricotz> <ricotz> jbicha, libpeas would be nice too, since 1.6.2 isnt even in quantal/raring
[18:07] <ricotz> <ricotz> and 1.7.0 is needed
[18:13] <jbicha_> yeah, we should get 1.6 at least (but it's not in the desktop set so I can't do it)
=== jbicha_ is now known as jbicha
[18:45] <ricotz> jbicha, another thing, mutter might need an unreleased clutter too to work correctly
[18:46] <ricotz> jbicha, since you are the only one uploading to the gnome3 ppas from the ubuntu-desktop team, do you care for having admin rights for the group?
[18:55] <jbicha> hmm, the new g-i still isn't enough to get the new gjs to work
[18:57] <jbicha> I'm already an admin since I'm on the desktop team, thanks though :)
[19:06] <ricotz> jbicha, you are sure gjs isnt working?
[19:12] <ricotz> it builds and tests (make check) is successful for you?
[19:17] <jbicha> it builds fine, but gdm only shows the wallpaper unless I downgrade gjs
[19:18] <jbicha> I've updated mutter, gnome-shell, gsettings-desktop-schemas and gnome-settings-daemon
[19:40] <ricotz> jbicha, you should have a look at the session log then
[19:40] <ricotz> (runs fine here)
[19:42] <ricotz> (although i use mozjs 1.8.7)
[23:23] <jbicha> darkxst: you could try asking the Fedora maintainer what he thinks about the new mozjs proposal https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/js/
[23:27] <darkxst> ok will try
[23:57] <darkxst> jbicha, anyway mozilla want to land this before releasing https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=812265
[23:57] <ubot5> Mozilla bug 812265 in Build Config "js/src needs versioning added to build system to support spidermonkey releases" [Normal,New]
[23:58] <darkxst> which looks like it will change version number to use firefox version
