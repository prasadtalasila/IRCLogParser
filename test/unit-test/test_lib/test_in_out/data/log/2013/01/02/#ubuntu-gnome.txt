[10:12] <ricotz> darkxst, i will try to package a snapshot from esr17 as 1.8.8
[10:12] <darkxst> ricotz, sure, but gjs still needs some work
[10:13] <darkxst> I can do most of it but stumped on that one thing per bugzilla report
[10:13] <ricotz> yes, this package won't interfere with the current working 1.8.7
[10:13] <darkxst> ok cool
[10:14] <darkxst> also could update the current esr10 snapshot, have been alot of commits to that branch since the last snapsnot
[10:14] <ricotz> darkxst, did you try to use the current esr10
[10:14] <ricotz> ah, about to ask that
[10:15] <darkxst> no didnt try, but would be suprised if it dont work
[10:16] <darkxst> the autoconf2.13 thing seems a pain? not sure how to work around that in deb package
[10:17] <ricotz> darkxst, i will create a "proper" tarball
[10:17] <darkxst> ricotz, yeh that is what I did
[10:17] <ricotz> meaning no need to autoconf in rules
[10:17] <darkxst> although I was using jhbuild for the 17esr
[10:23] <darkxst> ricotz, did you sort out the internal headers (from js/src/dist/include) in the deb? (I havent actualy checked, but assume you must have for gjs to build)
[10:35] <ricotz> darkxst, yes, they are installed now
[10:42] <darkxst> ok
[10:44] <darkxst> I know Jasper and owen are quite keen for an updated spidermonkey so the other bits should fall into place, once they are back from holidays
[11:07] <darkxst> ricotz, anyway I'm off to bed, good night
