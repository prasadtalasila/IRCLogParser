[03:33] <SunMoonStar1> Hi I have been using Lubuntu for 3-4 days but last night the lxpanel started acting up. The icons normally in the bottom right like the shutdown, time, and battery level icons dissapeared. I played with the applets and was able to get them to appear by unchecking 'stretch' on the spacer applet. However, those icons are now pressed up against the rest of the tray icons rather than being pressed into the bottom right. I can't get it fixed.
[03:34] <SunMoonStar1> in fact.. it seems that if i check stretch on any applet at all, any applet after that checked applet dissapears
[03:36] <SunMoonStar1> anyone here?
[04:03] <SunMoonStar1> I got kicked off. Did anyone answer my question about the lxpanel weirdness?
[04:06] <tramm> SunMoonStar1, no
[04:08] <SunMoonStar1> tramm: thanks
[04:08] <SunMoonStar1> I tried googling and can't find my problem
[04:12] <tramm> SunMoonStar1, have you tried to delete the settings of lxpanel and start from scratch?
[04:13] <SunMoonStar1> tramm: not delete, no, i tried to replace the config file with the default config file
[04:13] <SunMoonStar1> ill try to delete tho now
[04:21] <tramm> SunMoonStar1, bad advice?
[04:23] <SunMoonStar1> so I I removed ~/.config/lxpanel/Lubuntu/config and ~/.config/lxpanel/Lubuntu/panels/panel and restarted and the problem remains
[04:27] <tramm> good luck experimenting
[04:28] <SunMoonStar1> tramm: thanks for the suggestion anyways
[04:40] <SunMoonStar1> any good way of getting a global menu with lxde?

[10:46] <BWMerlin> Nvidia has updated their official driver release, how long does it take for that then to appear in the ubuntu repositories?
[15:27] <BWMerlin> When I open system information and benchmark nothing much happens
[15:27] <BWMerlin> I get two grey windows with no information
[21:55] <molgrum> hi, can i install lubuntu without a gui?
[21:57] <holstein> molgrum: if i wanted lubuntu without a gui, i would install ubuntuserver, or ubuntu minimal
[21:57] <holstein> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
[21:58] <molgrum> no i mean the installation should be no gui
[21:58] <holstein> lubuntu *is* ubuntu... but with LXDE (and other defaults).. to get lubuntu without the GUI would be just ubuntu with no gui
[21:58] <holstein> ubuntusever is a good place to start. or the minimal iso
[22:00] <molgrum> ok i'll try minimal
[22:00] <holstein> unless you mean you want to install with the alternate iso
[22:00] <holstein> the text based installer
[22:00] <holstein> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/12.04/release/
[22:00] <molgrum> yes exactly
[22:00] <holstein> the alternate iso is listed there
[22:00] <holstein> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/12.10/release/ if you prefer 12.10
[22:02] <molgrum> thank you
[22:08] <zleap> hi can someone help me with vnc please ?
[22:09] <Silverlion> zleap: what's the matter?
