[09:55] <Satoris> Trying to update q to r is failing for me. Update-manager says that 13/04 is available but trying to update to it or use do-release-upgrade just says "no new release found". Any tips?
[09:55] <Laney> do-release-upgrade -d
[09:56] <Laney> -d → development release → 13.04 isn't out, so you have to pass a flag to get it
[10:04] <Satoris> That seemed to do it. Thanks. Strange that update-manager does not pass the flag even if it is given '-c -d'.

[10:28] <notgary_> Hey, I was wondering if anyone on the Desktop team could help me with this question http://askubuntu.com/questions/240402/submit-merged-debian-package-for-inclusion-in-ubuntu
[10:29] <Laney> notgary_: It's probably easiest (for sponsors) if you submit the output of debdiff <debian .dsc> <your new .dsc> to a new bug with ubuntu-sponsors subscribed
[10:30] <notgary_> Should I also attach the merged branch as well?
[10:30] <Laney> sure, that won't hurt
[10:31] <Laney> IME merges are easier to sponsor with a debdiff, but perhaps some others prefer branches (if you already have it)
[10:31] <notgary_> Laney: Thanks a lot. I'll get on that tonight :)
[10:32] <Laney> cool beans. thank you for working on the update!

[15:01] <om26er> kenvandine, Hi!
[15:02] <om26er> kenvandine, seems gwibber got a problem updating facebook, its not working. (bug 1088775)
[15:02] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1088775 in gwibber (Ubuntu Quantal) "gwibber does not refresh Facebook feeds" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1088775
[15:03] <om26er> seems webupd8.org found a workaround for that as well. http://www.webupd8.org/2013/01/fix-facebook-not-working-with-gwibber.html
[15:06] <kenvandine> om26er, interesting
[15:07] <kenvandine> om26er, i couldn't reproduce that bug... did you reproduce it?
[15:08] <om26er> kenvandine, I have not tried that, I'll try that now
[15:08] <kenvandine> is it failing for you?
[15:08] <kenvandine> i tested the quantal version of gwibber on raring and couldn't reproduce it
[15:09] <kenvandine> and i can't get virtualbox working anymore, so can't get to quantal or precise VMs :/
[15:15] <om26er> kengyu, i just tested and its not working for me as well. I added a new account and my stream is black empty, I updated my status and that worked.
[15:15] <om26er> kenvandine, ^^
[15:15] <om26er> gwibber showed 'Refreshing' for a while and then... nothing
[15:15]  * om26er tries the workaround...
[15:17] <kenvandine> i just dumped the raw json from my feed and I don't have "privacy"
[15:17] <kenvandine> explains why it isn't blowing up here...
[15:18] <om26er> now it works
[15:18] <kenvandine> great
[15:18] <kenvandine> i'll prepare an SRU :)
[15:18] <kenvandine> om26er, thanks!
[15:18] <om26er> kenvandine, yw :)
[15:19] <om26er> kenvandine, for both precise and quantal, right ?
[15:19] <kenvandine> yeah
[15:19] <kenvandine> anyone here have success running virtualbox on raring?
[15:20] <kenvandine> bug 1088123
[15:20] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1088123 in virtualbox (Ubuntu) "Previously created VMs hang after a while after updating to raring" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1088123
[15:21] <kenvandine> i think that is what is happening to me...
[15:21] <chrisccoulson> i never have success running it because I don't have enough SSD space for a virtual machine ;)
[15:23] <kenvandine> it started just hanging for me on both my boxes right before i went on vacation
[15:23] <kenvandine> and no luck since
[15:26] <davmor2> kenvandine: don't enable 3d I found if I enable 3d raring locks up in vbox
[15:27] <kenvandine> i tried that
[15:27] <kenvandine> no joy
[15:28] <geser> chrisccoulson: I read at a IT news website a report about a 960GB SSD for around 550 € (announced a CES; Curcial M500). That should allow you to run some VMs :)
[15:31] <chrisccoulson> geser, that's still quite pricey for me ;)
[15:32] <chrisccoulson> although, i think i'm due a new laptop soon
[15:43] <meet> what all channels are there where i can ask for help?
[15:44] <robru> meet, #ubuntu is for support.
[15:45] <meet> robru: ok.. thanks
[16:35] <robru> anybody know how to use dbus-test-runner to pipe STDOUT from one task to STDIN of the next task?
[16:51] <cyphermox> robru: couldn't you pipe two calls to dbus-test-runner?
[16:52] <cyphermox> or make both run in a script and run the script through dbus-test-runner?
[16:52] <robru> cyphermox, I don't know, would that work? ;-)
[16:52] <cyphermox> easiest seems like option 2 to me ;D0
[16:53] <robru> cyphermox, it's a delicate balance here. we have a testsuite written in vala, testing some stuff written in python, both of which are invoked by dbus-test-runner, which is itself invoked by a shell script that is autogenerated by automake. the whole thing is a mess ;-)
[16:53] <cyphermox> ok
[16:53] <robru> kenvandine, ^
[16:54] <alesage> robru, curious which project you're working on?
[16:54] <robru> alesage, libfriends at the moment. the code is written in vala, so the testsuite is also vala. but we're trying to incorporate dbusmock to mock out some dbus stuff
[16:54] <cyphermox> then my suggestion would probably be to make your own dbus bus, export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS and run both tests by piping the results how you'd do it via the command line
[16:55] <alesage> robru ack
[16:55] <robru> cyphermox, alesage : so the challenge is that dbusmock spits the method calls out on STDOUT, so we need to capture that in the vala in order to confirm that the correct methods have been called
[16:57] <robru> pitti, this would be significantly easier if dbusmock provided a dbus method that could be called in order to confirm the call signature has been called correctly ;-)
[16:59] <pitti> robru: yay recursive errors :)
[16:59] <pitti> robru: but more seriously, it could certainly keep an internal log which you could query through a D-BUS method, indeed
[16:59] <robru> pitti, how is it recursive?
[16:59] <pitti> robru: can you please file a bug about it?
[16:59] <robru> pitti, ok, will do
[17:01] <pitti> good night everyone!

[18:39] <tkamppeter_> I am using Raring daily build from today.
[18:39] <sarnold> tkamppeter_: try the other hdmi?
[18:44] <tkamppeter_> sarnold, did already: On the left one I did not even get text console and boot splash, on the right I do not get X but text console and boot splash.
[18:45] <tkamppeter_> By the way, printing works perfectly on the Pandaboard, so as a headless print server it works.

[18:50] <tkamppeter> sarnold, my monitor has a DVI input and I connect the HDMI cable with an adapter.
[18:56] <tkamppeter> sarnold, do you have a monitor with real HDMI?
[18:56] <sarnold> tkamppeter: I have real HDMI, but my install was done on precise and upgraded to quantal
[18:56] <sarnold> tkamppeter: I haven't tried raring yet, sorry
[18:57] <tkamppeter> sarnold, so you have no experience with raring?
[18:57] <sarnold> tkamppeter: none :(
[18:57] <tkamppeter> Anyone has raring on a pandaboard?
[18:57] <tkamppeter> bryce, mlankhorst, around?
[19:01] <mlankhorst> yes?
[19:01] <mlankhorst> I run precise, still
[19:02] <didrocks> hey hey
[19:05] <seb128> didrocks, lut
[19:05] <tkamppeter> mlankhorst, were the pandaboards not intended to follow the current development?
[19:05] <didrocks> salut seb128 ;)
[19:06] <mlankhorst> tkamppeter: well i dont think the omap ppa supports raring or qunatal properly
[19:08] <mlankhorst> https://launchpad.net/~tiomap-dev/+archive/release
[19:10] <dobey> tedg: is bustle completely different in raring? i don't have the commands you mentioned
[19:11] <tedg> dobey, Yes
[19:11] <dobey> tedg: i'm also not sure how useful it is in this case. it just shows i'm doing a lot of indicator menu switching, but doesn't really show where cpu time is spent
[19:11] <tkamppeter> Anyone knows how much power the Pandaboard needs? I have found out that one can use a 1A USB power supply with a mini-USB cable instead of the supplied 4A power supply.
[19:11] <tedg> dobey, You have to use command line args on the main binary.
[19:12] <tedg> dobey, Sure, but it's the quick analogy we have to not setting up cachegrind.
[19:12] <tedg> dobey, It's a quick check.
[19:13] <dobey> tedg: right, but if i open the menus 1400 times, and you opened it 78, how do we compare that?
[19:15] <mlankhorst> 5 w or so?
[19:16] <mlankhorst> well typical use is 5w when i put it to my watt meter :)
[19:16] <mlankhorst> so that would explain why 1A was enough
[19:25] <tedg> dobey, By ratios.
[19:25] <tedg> dobey, If you're getting some insane number of messages in any one place, we should look into it.  I'm not looking for absolute measures, just looking for ideas of where to look next.
[19:27] <dobey> tedg: ok, i'll see if i can't get some numbers with that then, on my laptop

[19:48] <tkamppeter> mlankhorst, I am trying to boot an install image of Precise with another SD card now.
[19:49] <tkamppeter> mlankhorst, it seems to take very long time. The LEDs on the board are flashing and there is no image on the monitor.
[19:50] <tkamppeter> mlankhorst, the HDMI cable is plugged to the right connector, the one which gave text mode in Raring.
[19:51] <stgraber> hey ther, does any of you know where that annoying "An online account needs attention" dialog comes from? it's been popping up on some of my machines for months now and I have no idea what's the problem (as I don't have any online account setup) or even what's the software behind that dialog
[19:51] <stgraber> *there
[19:56] <robru> stgraber, are you using quantal or raring? I was getting it for a while too, but then it eventually fixed itself (there was a bug filed). maybe only fixed in raring, not sure.
[19:58] <stgraber> robru: I'm on raring and I'm also seeing it on quantal

[20:05] <stgraber> No accounts
[20:05] <stgraber> the message would vaguely make sense if I was using that feature, but I'm not and I never have :)
[20:06] <robru> stgraber, then I don't know :-P
[20:07] <sarnold> stgraber: a quick grep shows /usr/lib/gnome-online-accounts/goa-daemon ...
[20:08] <stgraber> sarnold: ah, why didn't I think of that? ;) thanks
[20:08] <seb128> stgraber, do you have any account listed in "XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-center online-accounts
[20:08] <seb128> "
[20:09] <stgraber> seb128: good catch! yes, I do, I have an "Enterprise Login" account listed here (kerberos)
[20:09] <seb128> that's likely it then
[20:09] <stgraber> seb128: that also explains why all my machines are showing this but only for network accounts
[20:09] <stgraber> so it's gnome behaving weirdly when you use kerberos authentication then
[20:09] <seb128> well that's the gnome online account stuff, not the ubuntu one
[20:10] <seb128> not sure what they are doing
[20:10] <stgraber> the only kerberos integration I noticed in gnome is gvfs using my domain credentials for shared network drives, but that was already supported before the introduction of the online accounts stuff
[20:13] <stgraber> ah, someone reported the same problem on the enterprise-ubuntu mailing-list. That dialog shows up when you login with cached credentials and so don't have a valid kerberos ticket after login (not that you could do anything about it in the online accounts dialog)
[20:14] <mlankhorst> tkamppeter: would help to attach serial :)
[20:16] <tkamppeter> mlankhorst, I do not have the cable yet. There were a lot of cables in the package but not the serial->USB one.
[20:16] <stgraber> seb128: would you be fine with a patch discarding the notification for kerberos accounts (as there's absolutely nothing the user can do from the UI in either Ubuntu's version of gnome-control-center or even upstream's)?
[20:17] <seb128> reporting the bug upstream would be useful, I would prefer avoiding adding yet another distro patch there
[20:18] <mlankhorst> tkamppeter: yeah I had a serial cable anyway, so it was no big deal for me
[20:23] <mlankhorst> first time takes a long time, it wants to do some resizing, so just give it some time, dno what happens when you interrupt that

[20:29] <tkamppeter> mlankhorst, under Precise nothing appears on the screen, not even a boot splash screen.
[20:31] <tkamppeter> mlankhorst, I hope I do not need a new monitor (with HDMI input).
[20:31] <mlankhorst> doubt it
[21:36] <qengho> Okay, whoever made the shell autocomplete "tar x_f fooTAB" to only files starting "foo" that match the compression type at the underscore, gets a beer from me next time we meet.
