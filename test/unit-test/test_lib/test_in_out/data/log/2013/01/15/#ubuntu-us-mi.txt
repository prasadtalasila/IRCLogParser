[00:08] <rick_h_> I hate windows...ugh
[00:36] <snap-l> rick_h_: a-yep
[01:04] <brousch1> rick_h_: Who has foisted this insult upon you?
[01:04] <rick_h_> meh, stupid medical software stuff
[01:04] <rick_h_> getting my wife a new laptop and rather than dual boot I'd prefer to just do ubuntu witha windows VM
[01:05] <rick_h_> but to do that, I have to buy a full real non-oem license to put in the VM
[01:05] <rick_h_> so not only do I buy a window license I don't need with the new machine, but another more expensive one that costs the same as the SSD for my wife to have a happier computing experience
[01:12] <brousch1> Hm, how do I tell a python program to use Python3?
[01:12] <rick_h_> /use/bin/env python3 ?
[01:15] <Blazeix> *usr
[01:17] <rick_h_> yea...that
[01:21] <brousch1> grrrr
[01:21] <brousch1> I'll just shove a copy of this damn module into my project. It's abandoned anyways
[01:25] <rick_h_> lol
[01:43] <brousch1> I'm going crazy
[01:43] <brousch1> It's like the python files in a module don't see the other files in the module
[01:44] <brousch1> From a.py I can't do import b even though they are in the same module and there's an __init__.py
[02:00] <brousch1> Wait a minute. I think they fucked with relative imports in python3
[02:01] <brousch1> Look at this crap http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0328/#guido-s-decision
[04:03] <brousch1> I dropped the module that wasn't even close to Python3 ready and implemented what I needed from it via command line tools
[13:45] <snap-l> Good morning
[13:45] <rick_h_> party
[13:45] <rick_h_> is it friday yet?
[13:46] <snap-l> Reply hazy. Ask again later.
[13:46] <rick_h_> damn
=== greg_g is now known as greg-g
[17:00] <snap-l> So, good day so far?
[17:00] <jcastro> good day for rick
[17:01] <jcastro> delicious merge proposals!
[17:01] <rick_h_> psh :P
[17:01] <rick_h_> landing day
[17:01] <snap-l> rick_h_: Oh, you've started using psh?
[17:01] <rick_h_> 2 down one to go
[17:01] <snap-l> ;)
[17:01] <snap-l> Launch days are the worst
[17:01] <rick_h_> not launch, land
[17:01] <snap-l> landing = ?
[17:01] <rick_h_> fortunately all our stuff is still pre-staging/staging
[17:02] <snap-l> Ah, ok
[17:02] <snap-l> landing changes vs launching changes
[17:02] <rick_h_> landing == in trunk
[17:02] <rick_h_> launching means no server behind port 80
[17:02] <rick_h_> err means behind server behind port 80 and such
[17:03] <snap-l> publicly accessible
[17:03] <rick_h_> there you go
[17:03] <rick_h_> something like that
[17:11] <greg-g> hah
[17:35] <rick_h_> grr, google stuff having issues today
[17:35] <rick_h_> gmail.com failed to load, now rietveld 500 issues, slow as crap too
[17:41] <rick_h_> jcastro: just a few fields not required eh? https://code.launchpad.net/~rharding/charmworld/qa_form_cleaning/+merge/143365 lol
[17:46] <jrwren> shite day
[18:15] <rick_h_> lol
[18:15] <rick_h_> The Website Ahead Contains Malware!
[18:15] <rick_h_> Google Chrome has blocked access to techcrunch.com for now.
[18:15] <snap-l> Good riddance.
[18:16]  * snap-l can get to Tech Crunch
[18:16] <rick_h_> in chrome?
[18:16] <snap-l> Yeah
[18:16] <snap-l> Are you in beta?
[18:16] <rick_h_> dev yea
[18:17] <snap-l> Hm
[18:21] <jrwren> why would you want to go to that web page?
[18:21] <rick_h_> was following a link to see wtf the FB announcement was
[18:24] <snap-l> Graph Search
[18:25] <snap-l> now can we please stop caring what valley hipsters think is near?
[18:27] <snap-l> neat, even. ;)
[18:35] <jcastro> rick_h_: heh yeah
[18:35] <jcastro> I should have been more specific with you in the first place
[18:36] <rick_h_> all good, got it worked out
[19:38] <brousch> I finally got that Python3 project released in stable condition. My first release in over a year
[19:41] <jrwren> cool
[19:41] <jrwren> so its final. python3 is the default and best.
[19:41] <brousch> he
[19:41] <brousch> h
[19:43] <brousch> I might have another one to jump on now
[19:48] <greg-g> man, confluence (by Atlassian) is horrible
[19:48] <snap-l> Which one is that?
[19:48] <greg-g> why do they give free licenses to floss projects? it just hurts floss projects
[19:48] <greg-g> can you see https://wiki.benetech.org/dashboard.action
[19:48] <greg-g> yeah, that's public, the one that looks like that
[19:49] <snap-l> Yeah. Looks like most Atlassian fare
[19:49] <jrwren> a lot of 15yo projects are ugly like that.
[19:49] <greg-g> it's not just the ugly part
[19:49] <snap-l> At lot of Java applications are ugly like that
[19:50] <greg-g> it's, I clicked on the "view history" link on a wiki page, looked at who edited, great, the saw the link "go back to page information" which totally sounded wrong, but it must know where I came from, so ok, NOPE, there's this weird ass summary of a wiki page that isn't the page
[19:50] <snap-l> greg-g: Atlassian seems like a company that wants to do good things, but has a butt that's full of lead (named Java and their legacy codebase)
[19:50] <greg-g> heh, fair
[19:50] <greg-g> I know nothing of them, just only been a user of confluence a couple times
[19:51] <snap-l> They have some interesting interoperability
[19:51] <snap-l> We had their ticket tracking software for one project that linked together with Fisheye (which was a repo-checker)
[19:51] <greg-g> huh
[19:51] <snap-l> That it worked as well as it did was shocking
[19:52] <snap-l> Jira
[19:52] <greg-g> yeah, that's the other time I've used their stuff, was at UMich where the Med School dept I worked in used it for issue tracking
[19:52] <snap-l> Were I to do everything in house, and had money to burn, I'd probably take it seriously.
[19:52] <greg-g> Sakai also uses it
[19:53] <snap-l> Barring that, I'd probably either pay someone else to host it, or use OSS
[19:53] <snap-l> seemed about the same effort either way.
[19:53] <jrwren> jira is a baby step up from bugzilla
[19:54] <snap-l> It wasn't horrible to use, just felt like every other issue / project tracking system: clunky, ill fitting, and baroque.
[19:55] <greg-g> heh
