[09:17] <marxjohnson> Brr! not going outside again today!
[09:20] <dwatkins> cycling in was definitely a lot more difficult in the cold
[09:23] <czajkowski> so much snow :(
[09:26] <dwatkins> is it not a good thing, czajkowski?
[09:27] <Laney> as long as it doesn't prevent my passage to the pub later
[09:27] <dwatkins> I have crampons for emergencies such as that.
[09:30] <czajkowski> dwatkins: no it's not
[09:30] <czajkowski> it's coming down very heavy in Guildford
[09:30] <TheOpenSourcerer> That's it. UK is fscked for a few days now.
[09:31] <TheOpenSourcerer> Heavy in Farnham too.
[09:32]  * Laney didn't feel the earthquake this morning :(
[09:53] <directhex> snowmageddon!
[10:02] <dwatkins> TheOpenSourcerer: no snow here in Scotland, we'll keep the deep fried mars bars and haggis flowing, don't worry
[10:04] <brobostigon> good morning everyone,
[10:15] <bigcalm> Ahoy ho
[10:15] <bigcalm> y
[10:15] <brobostigon> morning bigcalm
[10:16] <bigcalm> Hi brobostigon. Do you have snow? :)
[10:17] <brobostigon> bigcalm: yes, been snowing, since around 7pm yesterday.
[10:18] <bigcalm> Snowed all of yesterday but only just and didn't really stick. Bit different today :)
[10:18] <bigcalm> I would be having a fun snow day if I didn't work from home
[10:19] <brobostigon> :(
[10:19] <directhex> snowmageddon!
[10:19] <bigcalm> Heh
[10:19] <directhex> glad i went to tesco last night.
[10:19] <directhex> well stocked on canned beans and frozen pizza.
[10:19] <bigcalm> I did drive Hayley to work this morning though. I wonder what it'll be like when I need to pick her up later
[10:19] <directhex> nd orange truffle baileys
[10:20] <directhex> prius in snow = expensive brick
[10:20] <TheOpenSourcerer> dwatkins: There's really quite a lot here. Was nothing at 07:30. Now this: https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/instantupload/5834727968215267794
[10:20] <directhex> with doors and a heater
[10:21] <dwatkins> TheOpenSourcerer: I don't think I can open that link
[10:21] <directhex> nor i
[10:21] <directhex> it just says "ha ha no g+ for you, puny windows phone user"
[10:21] <directhex> or words to that effect

[10:22] <bigcalm> TheOpenSourcerer: you did
[10:23] <TheOpenSourcerer> Snow still coming down going to be knee deep by the time I have to walk to the pub.
[10:23] <TheOpenSourcerer> :-D
[10:29] <dwatkins> impressive
[10:30] <dwatkins> at least when it's that deep it's understandable that transport might be affected
[10:30] <dwatkins> when it's only a couple centimetres, we just laugh from north of the border (I'm from Reading, by the way)
[10:32] <TheOpenSourcerer> Has anyone created a selectable, drop down list that uses icons instead of words for a web interface? I know the <select><option> is out. Just wondering if there is a nice way to enable a user to choose from a list of Icons?
[10:45] <DJones> Ah...The joys of working from home when the snow comes down, coffee, central heating and a nice cozy office :)
[10:48] <dwatkins> Last time it snowed when I lived in Reading, I drove in to work (carefully) then started getting phonecalls form people saying there were having trouble getting in - I think they were scared to drive in the snow
[10:48] <czajkowski> https://plus.google.com/102921374554385564572/posts/3tSksKANgaW  Guildford snow!
[10:51] <gord> pfft, even we have more snow than that
[10:55] <diplo> heh it's just a covering, getting quite deep here now. Debating going home to work at lunch time
[10:56] <dwatkins> We're forecast snow here in Edinburgh in the afternoon, cycling home along the canal will be amusing.
[10:56] <diplo> dwatkins: I had that a couple of years ago, a dozen people phoned in saying they couldn't get in, I had driven past 11 of their houses to get to work
[10:56] <diplo> :D
[10:56] <dwatkins> diplo: sounds about right, yeah
[10:56] <Laney> if it's cold enough you'll be able to cycle /on/ the canal!
[10:58] <dwatkins> Laney: I think about that every time it even slightly freezes over :D
[10:58] <dwatkins> when the snow settles on it, then I might consider that more seriously
[10:59] <gord> we have exactly this much snow https://dl.dropbox.com/u/95627817/2013-01-18%2010.58.24.jpg
[11:02] <daubers> Morning
[11:07] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:08] <davmor2> is snow settling on the main road a bad thing?
[11:08] <bigcalm> Not if you work from home
[11:09]  * daubers waits for code to finish scp'ing across from the office
[11:09] <davmor2> by main road I mean the main one the ambulances, fire, police, buses and about 200 cars an hour use
[11:11] <dwatkins> davmor2: I'd expect it to be compacted or even melted by the passage of traffic
[11:12] <dwatkins> I used to live on a minor road, the snow just got compressed so was fairly slippery; I think they salt the major roads, and the warmth of the tyres should help melt all but the heaviest snow during the day
[11:12] <davmor2> dwatkins: erm no the snow fall is so heavy at the moment there are just ruts where the cars drive
[11:12] <dwatkins> oh right
[11:13] <dwatkins> in Reading a couple years ago, they salted the roads, then it warmed up and rained, when it cooled down again, the roads ended up covered in ice
[11:13] <daubers> View from my window http://ubuntuone.com/3XEi9C5C2t0m0FQDDzNtbA
[11:13] <dwatkins> the salt was washed away
[11:13] <davmor2> it actually looks foggy which is bizarre
[11:39] <davmor2> daubers: http://ubuntuone.com/5VBad3dEViPxwhJ1vMwOY0 view from mine and the distance you can see just reduce again :D
[11:42] <kvarley> Is it possible to install "Ubuntu TV" on a PC?
[11:42] <kvarley> As in the TV environment and the TV guide lens
[11:46] <kvarley> NVM found my answer on askubuntu
[11:47] <dwatkins> davmor2: which town/city are you in, out of curiosity?
[11:48] <dwatkins> http://uksnowmap.com/ is unsurprisingly very slow today
[11:48] <davmor2> dwatkins: The City of Dreams
[11:48] <dwatkins> a lovely place to be
[11:48] <davmor2> dwatkins: overwise known as Wolverhampton
[11:49] <dwatkins> aha I see, thanks
[11:55] <directhex> nobody uses #uksnow anymore. now it's #snowmageddon
[12:09] <davmor2> this kitty doesn't seem happy with the snowman https://twitter.com/BigCatWHF/status/292237040949538816/photo/1
[12:12] <dwatkins> perhaps it's just trying to make friends with it, like Hobbes does with Calvin...
[12:19] <davmor2> dwatkins: no the original comment was that it lasted about 12 seconds, you don't need friends like that :D
[12:37] <Laney> yay, finally the snow has arrived in nottingham
[12:38] <kvarley> Can Ubuntu TV also act as a server? So could I have an Ubuntu TV box running as a server connected to a capture card and then the rest of my Ubuntu PCs acting as clients receiving remote streams via ethernet?
[13:03] <BigRedS> Anyone know what I need to do to VirtualBox to make it so my VMs can acces both my host and the Internet?
[13:03] <BigRedS> I'm sure I've deduced it before, but none of the options seem to be working now
[13:06] <daftykins> you have to bridge your eth0 with the vbox interfaces don't you?
[13:06] <daftykins> at least to do it the way vmware does it
[13:06] <BigRedS> I thought a bridged network was how I did it last time..
[13:06] <BigRedS> I'll keep fiddling
[13:06] <daftykins> http://codesupply.net/content/setup-bridged-networking-virtualbox-ubuntu-1110
[13:07] <BigRedS> ta!
[13:08] <BigRedS> Whoa. Last time I went near /etc/network/interfaces network-manager wouldn't talk to me for weeks
[13:10] <daftykins> yeah it'll break with static config
[13:11] <daftykins> jebus vmware is £170 =|
[13:11] <BigRedS> yeah, I'm beginning to see NM as the common problem with virtualisation...
[13:12]  * BigRedS ponders hyper-v
[13:12] <daftykins> ugh the times i was involved with hyper-v i found it disgusting
[13:12] <daftykins> needing a windows domain? eww.
[13:12] <daftykins> it's changed a lot since then though, that was prior to server 2008 R2's release that i was using it
[13:13] <BigRedS> HAha, I don't mind how filthy it is, I just want to get on with some work and stop goading virtualisation software into working
[13:13] <BigRedS> Nah, I want a Debian Squeeze VM
[13:13] <BigRedS> but I want to SSH into it and then let it download from the Inernet
[13:14] <BigRedS> which appears to be something of an impossibility with network0-manager, and I don't have a long enough cat5 cable to switch to etherent
[13:16] <daftykins> hrmm
[13:17] <BigRedS> Im borrowing a VM on The Internet now :)
[13:18] <BigRedS> Still, I'm sure this problem was roughly solved about four years ago and can't quite see why it's all broken now
[13:18] <daftykins> i can't even imagine how you'd do it in Linux land
[13:18] <daftykins> vmware on Windows, which is what i always use, has its' own taps into interfaces so it doesn't matter
[13:20] <BigRedS> yeah, virt-manager set up its own bridges which worked well for a while
[13:20] <BigRedS> but now n-m dislikes those and keeps disabling them
[13:21] <daftykins> XD
[13:21] <BigRedS> really, I want to just replace n-m with something that's aware that all it's supposed to do is connect to a wifi network and shut up
[13:22] <BigRedS> I don't understand what it thinks it adds to any other interface. But my brief faffing with wpa-supplicant and friends the other day demonstrated that it's not something I can just knock up in an afternoon
[13:24] <daftykins> *nods*
[13:24] <daftykins> dark magic
[13:26] <BigRedS> yeah, I guess there's a good reason that nobody's yet done that and we all just trot along tolerating n-m
[13:27] <BigRedS> A bit tempted to just set up an unsecured  network in each of the six or seven places I tend to wantwifi
[13:29] <daftykins> hehe
[13:42] <davmor2> BigRedS: for me I click on the settings button → networking option → and change nat to bridge adapter then when you start up the guest it automatically fetches the new ip address from you dhcp server
[13:44] <BigRedS> davmor2: yeah, that's what I thought worked, but it just didn't
[13:44] <BigRedS> I'll give it another go in a bit if this router keeps crapping out
[13:50] <BigRedS> Oooh, seems to work
[13:51] <BigRedS> wonder how long it'll take for network manager to oppose it :)
[13:53] <davmor2> BigRedS: well if you will do silly things with your network then this will happen :P  I only ever seem to have issues with NM when I'm not sat in my home for some reason :D
[13:56] <BigRedS> davmor2: yeah, that's the silly thing! I've been trying to work when not at work :)
[13:56] <BigRedS> I think it's just trying to enforce some relaxation or something
[13:56] <BigRedS> it's like an over-concerned mother
[13:56] <davmor2> hahaha
[14:03] <kvarley> Can anybody recommend a good gui for scheduling commands to run at a certain time? This is a one off command, not a daily/weekly/monthly kind of thing
[14:04] <dwatkins> a front-end to 'at', kvarley?
[14:06] <kvarley> dwatkins: Preferably it would work with X forwarding via SSH too.
[14:06] <kvarley> dwatkins: I'd be happy to use CLI too but I don't want it to be too complicated since it's only for running commands once at a certain time on a system
[14:07] <dwatkins> Personally, I'd just use 'at', I don't know if there's a form-based GUI for it.
[14:07] <BigRedS> at's a pretty simple syntax
[14:07] <BigRedS> though a bit obscure, too
[14:07] <BigRedS> basically, you do   at <time>   and hit enter
[14:07] <BigRedS> and then list your commands, and hit ctrl-D
[14:07] <kvarley> Can I do sudo stuff?
[14:08] <BigRedS> if you have nopasswd
[14:08] <BigRedS> or you just sudo at
[14:08] <kvarley> I want to update and install certain packages after 6pm (when my internet tariff relaxes) on computers on my lan
[14:08] <kvarley> Will it work remotely BigRedS?
[14:08] <BigRedS> hm, might need to sudo su and then at
[14:08] <BigRedS> remotely?
[14:08] <BigRedS> you'll want to ssh onto whichever machine you want the command to run
[14:08] <kvarley> Yeah as in can I login via SSH and then do at on the remote machine?
[14:09] <BigRedS> yeah
[14:09] <kvarley> Yeah, that's good, thanks :) BigRedS & dwatkins
[14:09] <BigRedS> sshing in to a machine is basically the same as being sat in front of it
[14:10] <kvarley> BigRedS: wondered if it would kill 'at' when the session ended was all
[14:10] <kvarley> I did at 14:10 and added my command but it keeps getting me onto a new command line now
[14:10] <kvarley> How do I say end of commands?
[14:14] <Seeker`> ctrl-D
[14:14] <Seeker`> as BigRedS said
[14:15] <kvarley> Ah thanks sorry, missed it
[14:15] <kvarley> Doesn't seem to work
[14:15] <kvarley> I said for it to open gedit but nothing happens, is that cos it runs in a different shell?
[14:16] <dwatkins> kvarley: you might also find 'screen' useful in general, although perhaps you already use it
[14:16] <kvarley> dwatkins: I do :)
[14:20] <BigRedS> you want to open gedit?
[14:33] <kvarley> BigRedS: It was only for a test. I was checking it worked but then realised if I did a command line activity it does actually work
[14:37] <bgstsr> OOOooo .. someone just asked me "Would you like to use a different operating system ? " ..
[14:38] <BigRedS> kvarley: ahhh
