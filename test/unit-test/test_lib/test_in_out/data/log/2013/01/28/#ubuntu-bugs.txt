[17:10] <hjd> Hi all. A while back I filed bug 1091680 which has now been fixed version and no longer occurs in Raring. However, 12.10 is still affected, so I thought about requesting an SRU. That would stop it from crashing, but I'm not familiar with this package so I cannot really verify if it is working as intended beyond that. Should I still request an SRU as it would at least address the crash?

[17:13] <hggdh> hjd: you can still ask for a SRU. As long as the version is the same, there should not be a problem. If the version changed,it may be more complex (the patch will have to be backported)
[17:24] <FernandoMiguel> hey gang
[17:24] <FernandoMiguel> can someone help me fill this bug a little bit better

[17:27] <hjd> hggdh: Ok, only the "debian patch level" changed. I've updated the description a bit now. If you think it looks ok, could you target it to quantal? :)

[17:30] <hggdh> hjd: nominated. Please be aware that we will now depend on someone working on it to propose a debdiff (it is a Universe package)
[17:31] <hggdh> FernandoMiguel: it freezes, correct? If so, can you add a backtrace for it?
[17:32] <FernandoMiguel> hggdh: don't have one... that's all I get by running in debug
[17:32] <FernandoMiguel> want a strace?
[17:32] <FernandoMiguel> should be dead easy
[17:33] <hggdh> FernandoMiguel: both a strace and a backtrace... for the backtrace, make sure you have the debug packages for pidgin & major dependencies and, from a terminal, run gdb against the frozen pidgin
[17:33] <FernandoMiguel> let me try
[17:34] <hggdh> FernandoMiguel: in gdb, run 'thread apply all bt'
[17:34] <FernandoMiguel> kay
[17:34] <FernandoMiguel> it has been long since I ran those :O
[17:34] <hggdh> heh
[17:34] <hggdh> it is time for you to renew your friendship with gdb ;-)
[17:36] <FernandoMiguel> /usr/bin/pidgin -dddddddnm -c /tmp/t1: No such file or directory.
[17:36] <FernandoMiguel> gdb doesn't like me :s
[17:37] <FernandoMiguel> I remember vaguely I had to give full paths
[17:37] <hggdh> it may be that pidgin is actually a shell script (don't know, don't have it installed here on Raring)
[17:38] <hggdh> if so, you have to get into the script, and run gdb against the actual binary it drives
[17:38] <FernandoMiguel> :\
[17:39] <FernandoMiguel> /usr/bin/pidgin isa binary
[17:39] <hjd> hggdh: Thanks. I still subscribe ubuntu-sru right away, right?
[17:39] <hggdh> hjd: you should subscribe -sru when the debdiff is ready
[17:44] <hjd> ok :)
