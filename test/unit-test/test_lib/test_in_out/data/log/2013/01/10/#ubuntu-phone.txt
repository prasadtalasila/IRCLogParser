[09:51] <Robbilie> was there a recent update on the lnk? if not, i am aware f all the information provided there talus46
[09:52] <Robbilie> ah ok now its there
[09:52] <Robbilie> thanks
[09:59] <bobweaver> From all the videos that I have bben watching yeah flash rom
[10:00] <bobweaver> "zip file in the end"  dude said in a video
[10:37] <bobweaver> I am board what pp should I make ?
[10:37] <bobweaver> app *
[10:38] <Robbilie> what have yyou developed yet?
[10:38] <bobweaver> webbrowsing and apis so far
[10:39] <bobweaver> I made like a bunch of xmllistmodel elements and stuff
[10:39] <Robbilie> so a web browsing app wouldnt make much sense huh? :D
[10:39] <bobweaver> Like things to watch hulu and what not
[10:40] <chriadam> how about a gig browser?  uses your current location, to grab all the gigs in the local area, within a given time period.  Could filter by distance, genre, price.  Displays them on a map, integrates with a calendar.
[10:41] <chriadam> i'm sure there are a billion of them already, now that I think about it
[10:41] <bobweaver> yeah I have a jambase xmllistmodel ready for that but that is just jambase
[10:43] <popey> bobweaver: maps app?
[10:43] <popey> using OSM tiles
[10:44] <bobweaver> Like nokia maps popey  ?
[10:45] <popey> like any maps app ☺
[10:45]  * bobweaver dosent kniow what OSM is 
[10:45] <popey> OpenStreetMap
[10:45] <bobweaver> ahh
[10:45] <popey> http://www.openstreetmap.org/
[10:45] <bobweaver> http://imagebin.org/242371
[10:46] <M4rtinK> I plan to port modRana: http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/modrana/
[10:46] <popey> hah
[10:47] <M4rtinK> uses OSM tiles & supports both online & offline routing with spoken directions
[10:47] <M4rtinK> + many other features
[10:47]  * Tak wonder if any of his maemo apps survived
[10:47] <bobweaver> but nokia maps is not the greatest it uses google maps api and does not have much in the sence of searching and what not
[10:48] <chriadam> bobweaver: there's an OSM plugin for QtLocation floating around
[10:48] <M4rtinK> Tak: I'm still supporting Maemo 5 by the way (heck even SHR@Neo FreeRunner with the GTK GUI :) )
[10:48] <bobweaver> I will make popey gangnam style app that has him doing the dance
[10:48] <bobweaver> chriadam,  cool stuff thanks
[10:48] <bobweaver> qt4 ?
[10:50] <bobweaver> popey,  anywhere that I can find a head shot of you ?
[10:51] <popey> uhoh
[10:51] <bobweaver> launchpad is not cut out
[10:51] <bobweaver> I guess I could cut it out or I could make it so that you can add peoples heads to it
[10:51] <bobweaver> this is going to be fun Ubuntu Community gangnam style app
=== chriadam is now known as chriadam|away
[11:42] <popey> speaking of maps bobweaver i just discovered http://www.refnum.com/tmp/apple.html which compares the tiles for Apple, OSM and Google maps

[19:53] <mattlgroff> I got an information packet for OEM's and Operators at CES, and it says the high end version can run on an Intel Atom. x86 Ubuntu Phone anyone?
[19:54] <popey> ☺
[20:39] <k1l_> x86 version is a clever move, imho. intel wants to push back into the mobile market. But Android is quite bound to ARM
[20:44] <ubuntubhoy> hmm, the libhoudini stuff works pretty well TBH
[23:18] <GuidoPallemans1> anyone else already developing qml apps?
[23:20] <netcurli> at least trying to (and running into a few bugs with the beta :D) https://plus.google.com/u/0/111619044192746082060/posts/CZt2B4ARAez
[23:21] <netcurli> the popups provided with ubuntu compontens seem also not to work flawlessly at the moment
[23:35] <GuidoPallemans1> oh I'm making a Reddit app too :D
[23:35] <GuidoPallemans1> but i'm kinda going for the full thing
[23:36] <netcurli> that was just the first json api without api key I could find :D
[23:36] <GuidoPallemans1> heh
[23:36] <GuidoPallemans1> it's a really good api
[23:37] <GuidoPallemans1> the reddit one
[23:37] <netcurli> I haven't looked that deep into this
[23:37] <GuidoPallemans1> the Ubuntu one looks very promising, but they need to eliminate bugs and document more...
[23:38] <netcurli> jep, that's for sure
[23:38] <GuidoPallemans1> and they really made a good choice on going with qml, that shit's easy yo
[23:38] <GuidoPallemans1> care if I use your search function? I don't have one yet...
[23:39] <GuidoPallemans1> (btw: #qt-qml )
[23:40] <netcurli> go ahead and use it :) I like to see my code being used
[23:40] <netcurli> what I put out in the open anyway
[23:41] <GuidoPallemans1> thanks
