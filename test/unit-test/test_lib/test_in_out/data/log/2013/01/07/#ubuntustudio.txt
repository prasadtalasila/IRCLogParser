[02:19] <FloatingGoat> holstein: hi
[06:44] <cfhowlett> Hey Fellow US users/devs:  Is there ANY chance that I can get the source or fnished files for the proposed Oneric wallpapers as seen in:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/Artwork/OfficialOneiric
[06:44] <cfhowlett> *specifically the "Etched" look wallpapers.   They rock.  I wants ...
[06:46] <Len-nb> How?
[06:47] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: I don't know who to ask, but SOMEONE has to know.
[06:47] <Len-nb> Do you want me to mirror it?
[06:47] <Len-nb> Why can't you get to it?
[06:47] <Len-nb> https?
[06:47] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: no, I want to use those wallpapers!
[06:48] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: but I'm perfectly happy to make them available.
[06:48] <Len-nb> yes, why can't you just down load them or are they not full size on that page?
[06:49] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: oh, that.  Not full sized images.
[06:50] <Len-nb> Ah, so you are looking for the originals.
[06:50] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: precisely.  Excuse my incoherence.
[06:50] <Len-nb> No problem, I'm a bit tired
[06:51] <Len-nb> I don't know where theyu would be tough
[06:51] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: I'm also assuming that that originals do not have the "Ubuntu Studio Etched ..." overlay.
[06:53] <Len-nb> Ya, me too
[06:53] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: grr.  I looked but couldn't find the original artist info.  Presumably, these were "officially" authored proposals, not user contributed.  Kind of hoped someone in the know would know.  I'll cross post to the mail list.  Maybe someone out there can point me in the right direction.
[06:57] <Len-nb> It should be on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuStudio/Artwork/UserContributed
[06:57] <Len-nb> but it is not there
[06:58] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: as I said, I don't believe it was user contributed.  It appears to be the official Ubuntu Studio wiki as User Contributions were directed elsewhere.
[07:01] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: query submitted to the user/dev mailing lists.
[07:03] <Len-nb> cfhowlett, If I look at the image info, some of them seem to actually be on image shack.
[07:03] <Len-nb> right click on the image and check.
[07:05] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: I saw.  Attempting to track it down through that source3 now.
[07:05] <Len-nb> I couldn't
[07:05] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: unfortunately for me, Imageshack appears to be blocked by the great firewall here in China, so I can't access.
[07:06] <Len-nb> I get a message saying it has been removed.
[07:06] <Len-nb> I have to go now. bed time.
[07:07] <Len-nb> Bye
[07:13] <cfhowlett> Len-nb: OK.  thanks.
[11:01] <cfhowlett> who is maintaining this site?  http://ubuntustudio.tv/about/
[13:42] <audiophilo> hi
[13:43] <audiophilo> is there any suggested/recommended PPA for Ubuntu Studio 12.10?
[14:02] <zequence> audiophilo: What do you mean? PPAs that Ubuntu Studio recommends?
[14:02] <zequence> Ubuntu Studio itself is entirely in the main Ubuntu repo
[14:03] <zequence> And we can't officially recommends any PPAs, since they are not a part of a tested distribution
[14:03] <zequence> But, if someone has a special requirement, it might be there's a PPA that helps to fulfil that
[14:04] <audiophilo> zequence, hi, i know Ubuntu Studio has its own PPA, but i was wondering if there something else that could be useful to add
[14:06] <zequence> audiophilo: Ubuntu Studio does not have a PPA for common use, no. And Ubuntu Studio can't officially recommends any PPAs either
[14:07] <zequence> But, one which is very popular is KXStudio PPA
[14:07] <audiophilo> zequence, thanks for the tip i'll take a look at it
[14:08] <zequence> It includes some packages that Ubuntu is not distributing, like linux-sampler
[14:09] <audiophilo> zequence, great
[14:12] <audiophilo> zequence, i was also looking for festige, i see there's a PPA called falktx but unfortunately i can't see no 12.10 release. Do you know any other for this piece of sw?
[14:12] <zequence> audiophilo: KXStudio in itself is actually a distro based on Ubuntu
[14:12] <zequence> audiophilo: Check out #kxstudio
[14:12] <zequence> I think festige is old and replaced
[14:12] <zequence> Not sure
[14:13] <audiophilo> zequence, oh didn't know that i'll google it
[14:13] <zequence> audiophilo: Also, do check out #opensourcemusicians
[14:13] <audiophilo> zequence, thank you very much
