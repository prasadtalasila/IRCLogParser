[06:11] <therve> hazmat, it's in a landscape branch for now
[12:12] <bac> good morning italians
[12:13] <teknico> good morning viet... ehm, puerto rico :-)
[12:18] <bac> frankban: 2nd review done.  nice branch.
[12:24] <frankban> bac: thanks. do you feel better?
[12:25] <bac> frankban: yes, thank you.
[14:01] <hazmat> therve, ah ic
[14:01] <hazmat> thanks
[14:10] <hazmat> therve, any issue if i put a copy into pyjuju?
[14:11] <therve> hazmat, nope, no problem. It may be in landscape client soon enough anyway :)
[14:12] <benji___> I wonder if we should make lbox submit error out if there are any "pending" (skipped) tests.
=== benji___ is now known as benji
[14:43] <bac> benji: so i the phantomjs stuff supposed to be working?  not for me.
[14:44] <benji> bac: yep it works, it can be a (slight) pain to set up though.  In what way is it failing?
[14:44] <benji> (I'm glad you are back among the living.)
[14:44] <bac> thanks
[14:44] <bac> just dies with rc 2
[14:47] <benji> bac: does the phantomjs executable run for you?  (just run "phantomjs")
[14:48] <bac> benji: ah...  yes it is on my path but cannot run.  perhaps i grabbed the wrong one for my vm
[15:04] <bac> thanks benji, that was it
[15:04] <benji> cool
=== Makyo|out is now known as Makyo
[15:29] <hazmat> arosales, benji, bcsaller, bac, frankban, Makyo, teknico standup in 1m
[15:32] <teknico> hazmat, you're beginning without youOHWAIT
[15:32] <hazmat> teknico, ack
[15:33] <arosales> hazmat: Hello
[15:33] <hazmat> arosales, no worries.. just pinging folks for the gui standup
[15:34] <arosales> hazmat: ah, ok.  
[17:12] <benji> hazmat: in the description of "kill node-minify usage lib/merge-files in favor of uglify2" it says "gets rid of java" which, unfortunately, isn't true if we continue to use the YUI minifier.  Do we want to continue using it or switch to non-minified (but still combined) CSS to be rid of Java or should we keep minifying (and Java)?
[17:13] <hazmat> benji, uglify2 is a minifier
[17:14] <benji> hazmat: oh, it will do CSS?
[17:14]  * hazmat pauses while brain processes
[17:15] <hazmat> benji, clean-css might be an alternative for that
[17:15] <hazmat> no re uglify and css
[17:15] <hazmat> https://github.com/GoalSmashers/clean-css
[17:16] <benji> hazmat: clean-css sounds fine; I'm just going to do the JS side of things in this branch then and leave the YUI/CSS/Java bits alone.
[17:17] <hazmat> benji, awesome.. i'd check if uglify itself has source code map support.
[17:18] <benji> hazmat: yep, from the uglify help: "--source-map       Specify an output file where to generate source map."
[17:18] <hazmat> benji, it looks like uglify-js > 2 has support .. the ugilify2 
[17:18] <hazmat> is a separate thing
[17:18] <hazmat> cool
[17:20] <hazmat> another nodejs css compressor.. https://github.com/ded/sqwish
[17:21] <hazmat> added card with links to both
[17:23] <benji> cool
[17:23] <hazmat> benji, interesting.. node-minify has options for not using yui and for passing args through to uglify and sqwish
[21:51] <benji> I have a very, very small branch up for review: https://codereview.appspot.com/7228054; it removes the need to have java installed in order to build the app
[21:58] <bac> benji: i've slogged through your branch.  land as is.
[21:59] <benji> heh
[22:17] <Makyo> Taking a look, benji, but getting  an error in there with no context.  Digging into it.
[22:20] <Makyo> { [Error: Command failed: /bin/sh: 1: undefined: not found] killed: false, code: 127, signal: null }
[22:38] <Makyo> node debugger isn't catching it, boo.
