=== ajmitch_ is now known as ajmitch
[21:44] <chilts> morning
[21:46] <thumper> morning
[21:46] <thumper> I expect this will be in interesting week
[21:46] <thumper> with CES on
[21:46] <thumper> I also saw rumour somewhere that steam is producing a linux based "box" for gaming
[21:47] <ajmitch> that rumour's been pretty widespread lately, almost confirmed by valve
[21:56] <mwhudson> huh
[21:56] <mwhudson> that would be interesting
[22:00] <G> of course, a Steam linux-based console/'box', if done right, is likely to create a bit of pain for the other 'open' game consoles
[22:02] <mwhudson> thumper: when are flying through wellington?  we're flying up to auckland around then
[22:02] <mwhudson> thumper: would be pretty hilarious if we overlapped
[22:02] <thumper> mwhudson: Wed 16th, back Wed 23rd
[22:03] <thumper> although on the way back is through CHC
[22:03] <thumper> cheapest flights to Gisborne is through Auckland....
[22:03] <thumper> weird, but true
[22:03] <mwhudson> ah, we're flying on the 18th
[22:03] <mwhudson> most flights in and out are the tiny planes i think
[22:03] <thumper> DUD->WLG->AKL->GIS is cheaper than DUD->WLG->GIS
[22:04] <mwhudson> maybe the aucklands are bigger
[22:04] <thumper> maybe
[22:04] <mwhudson> your family would be like half one of the beechcraft :-)
[22:04] <thumper> heh
[22:06] <mwhudson> heh "Gisborne Airport is one of the few airports in the world that has a railway line, the Palmerston North - Gisborne Line, crossing the main runway."

[22:09] <thumper> http://www.examiner.com/article/valve-s-steam-box-to-be-released-q1-2013-to-compete-with-ps4-and-xbox-720
[22:09] <thumper> so, yes happening, still up in the air as to specs
[22:10] <ajmitch> nice to know
[22:10] <ajmitch> it might mean a few more games being available on ubuntu
[22:11] <ajmitch> since ubuntu by itself probably isn't enough of an attraction for game developers to spend time porting
[22:20] <thumper> apparently blizzard has a native linux WoW client
[22:21] <ajmitch> yeah they've had it for some time. but have never wanted to release it since they've had to support it
[22:21] <thumper> :)
[22:21] <ajmitch> and given how intrusive their anti-cheating system is meant to be, I'm not surprised
