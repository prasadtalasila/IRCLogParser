[02:18] <mspencer_> Hi, I was working on a bug fix (LP #657275) a while ago but haven't had time to test it until now.  Apport has been updated since then so now my fix is in an older version. What do I need to do to get it into the current version of Apport?

[02:37] <mandrig> Is there a known delay for Launchpad to be able to verify PGP keys? I'm trying to attach my key to my Launchpad account, and LP keeps telling me there's an issue with my key.
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> mandrig, about 15 - 30 minutes i think.
[02:40] <TheLordOfTime> before LP will recognize it on the PGP keyservers
[02:40] <mandrig> Thank you TheLordOfTime, I figured there was a propogation delay or something :)
[02:40] <TheLordOfTime> yeah, its not usually long though, i've seen it work in 5 minutes before, but i'd give it up to 30 just in case things're being slowish

[13:04] <Laney> Can someone tell why this source package build is failing with a failed patch application? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1495288
[13:04] <Laney> You can see the patch in question applying correctly at the start, but then for some reason dpkg-source tries to apply it again and only one file in it fails ?!?!?!
[13:07] <diwic> Laney, your skills are bigger than mine, but "*** No rule to make target `distclean'." might be a hint?
[13:08] <diwic> Laney, a distclean should have unapplied the patches?
=== Tonio__ is now known as Tonio_aw
[13:11] <ogra_> dh_clean should, no ?
[13:11] <Laney> don't think so
[13:11] <diwic> hmm, I'm trying here
[13:12] <Laney> why does it pick that one in the middle of the series?
[13:12] <Laney> which happens to be the one I just added
[13:12] <diwic> just apt-get source
[13:13] <diwic> Laney, which one did you add?
[13:13] <Laney> add-pkgconfig-file
[13:13] <diwic> could there be stray .pc directories?
[13:16] <Laney> still happens if I quilt pop -a; rm -r .pc; debuild -S
[13:17] <diwic> maybe it's some kind of bug related to .pc files in the actual patch too?
[13:17] <diwic> or maybe I'm just shooting in the dark
[13:17] <ogra_> i wonder what dh_autoreconf_clean does to Makefile.am ...
[13:18] <cjwatson> I don't think it's picking one in the middle of the series - I think it suppresses output from applications that succeed
[13:18] <geser> patch "import-camerabin" touches Makefile.am too
[13:18] <cjwatson> I would tend to agree with ogra_ that some kind of interaction with dh_autoreconf_clean is likely to be at fault
[13:19] <cjwatson> Make sure you quilt refreshed in a clean state (after dh_autoreconf_clean)
[13:20] <Laney> dh_autoreconf hasn't been run in this tree
[13:20] <cjwatson> Well, although thinking about it dh-autoreconf really shouldn't be touching Makefile.*am*
[13:20] <Laney> so I doubt _clean is doing anything
[13:20] <cjwatson> Only Makefile.in
[13:20] <Laney> there's no fuzz with this patch
[13:20] <cjwatson> So I don't know and need to run :)
[13:21] <Laney> running the erroring command (after changing paths) works
[13:21]  * Laney wibbles
[13:22] <Laney> let me tar up the directory :-)
[13:24] <Laney> oh, ffs
[13:25] <Laney> so the answer was that I had accidently edited Makefile.am outside of the patch and inserted some whitespace
[13:26] <diwic> ok :-)
[13:26] <Laney> which quilt was happy patching as it was consistent within the directory
[13:26] <Laney> but when applied on top of the orig.tar.xz it obviously fails

[14:15] <pitti> tkamppeter: yup, doing
[14:19] <OdyX> ^ woot
[14:20] <OdyX> tkamppeter: can you make your changelog entries less verbose ? Specifying all affected files for a split makes it unnecessarily verbose.
[14:20] <tkamppeter> pitti, OdyX, the test failure in the Debian package of CUPS seems to be small, it one error message in error_log too much.

[14:23] <pitti> (i. e. the extra depends)
[14:24] <pitti> tkamppeter: or is that for more easily uninstalling this feature? (but I thought ordinarily you would configure it off, not uninstall)
[14:25] <OdyX> tkamppeter: also, you forgot to move the manpages
[14:26] <melodie> hello, would someone know what Casper/Ubiquity uses to define the ubiquity-frontend-gtk background please ?
=== fisted_ is now known as fisted
[14:27] <xnox> melodie: the paths to backgrounds are hard-coded in ubiquity-dm, and a custom wallpaper binary is used to "paint" them in ubiquity mode. (The wallpaper picture in the background of ubiquity)
[14:28] <xnox> in live-session mode - is done the same way as in final install.
[14:28] <melodie> xnox, humm... how could I add a custom wallpaper binary in a customized version I am working on ?
[14:28] <melodie> because for now it's plain black and somehow difficult to read. :D
[14:29] <xnox> melodie: raring? wallpaper is broken in raring dailies.
[14:29] <xnox> to replace background drop it here and it will be used: /usr/share/backgrounds/warty-final-ubuntu.png
[14:29] <melodie> no it's Precise
[14:29] <melodie> oh !
[14:30] <xnox> or in ubiquity-dm look for backgrounds paths and you can modify it =)
[14:30] <melodie> I'll have to look what the files installed by ubiquity-dm then : maybe I'll use the easy solution
[14:30] <xnox> (yes default background is always called "warty", meh )
[14:30] <melodie> let met see what this /usr/share/backgrounds/ png file looks like
[14:30] <melodie> I don't mind the name, thanks
[14:31] <tkamppeter> pitti, the separation of the CUPS daemon allows having the CUPS damon for only driverless printing, for example printing to remote CUPS queues. This is a scenario for mobile, like Ubuntu for Android.
[14:31] <tkamppeter> OdyX.
[14:31] <melodie> xnox, that's exiting !
[14:31] <tkamppeter> OdyX. ^^
[14:32] <melodie> xnox, thank you very much !
[14:32] <xnox> np. =)
[14:32] <melodie> here is a pic of what I am doing : http://meets.free.fr/debian/images/BoxBuntu.png
[14:33] <pitti> tkamppeter: ah, so it's to avoid the cups-filters dependency, not the other way around
[14:33] <tkamppeter> pitti, OdyX, one gets a 1MB (cups-damon + libcups2 + cups-browsed) printing stack. I have intendedly left all docs in the "cups" package to save space. The cupsd is started automatically anyway.
[14:34] <pitti> tkamppeter: uploaded; will take a bit though as this has to get through Debian's NWE
[14:34] <pitti> NEW
[14:34] <tkamppeter> pitti, and to leave out CUPS' own heavy stuff like filters, backends, the web interface, documentation, ...
[14:35] <tkamppeter> Odyx ^^
[14:35] <melodie> xnox, I don't find a file under /usr/share/backgrounds for now
[14:35] <melodie> neither in my box nor in a lubunti
[14:35] <melodie> lubuntu
[14:36] <OdyX> pitti: did you upload to Debian ?
[14:36] <melodie> what size is that image supposed to be ?
[14:36] <pitti> OdyX: cups-filters, not cups
[14:36] <OdyX> pitti: ah okay.
[14:36] <OdyX> pitti: I'm currently merging master-wheezy
[14:37] <xnox> melodie: it can be one of these four names: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/ubiquity/trunk/view/head:/bin/ubiquity-dm#L383
[14:37] <tkamppeter> OdyX, about the test failure, all error messages in error_log of the test are here: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1495462/
[14:38] <tkamppeter> pitti ^^
[14:38] <OdyX> tkamppeter: the one too much is "Filter "urftopdf" not found.
[14:38] <tkamppeter> OdyX, pitti, there is one error message more than expected, but I do not know which one.
[14:39] <OdyX> tkamppeter: … I guess
[14:39] <melodie> xnox, thanks, I look. I am also looking into the python script ubiquity-dm now and I might be interested in the lubuntu-openbox method, because the box I build is with openbox (no dm)
[14:39] <tkamppeter> OdyX, urftopdf was added to cups-filters very recently.
[14:40] <pitti> tkamppeter: right, that's the most plausible one
[14:40] <melodie> xnox, I'll have to pick one that exists, to get the right size of image, to do one specifically for this openbox remix
[14:41] <melodie> I might have a xubuntu iso, I'll try to extract it from there
[14:41] <tkamppeter> pitti, OdyX: /usr/lib/cups/filter/urftopdf exists on the system where I did the build.
[14:41] <ogra_> xnox, heh, funny that only edubuntu has a generic name for it
[14:42] <xnox> ogra_: tbh, we should be querying xfce-config / gsettings what now & use that. Otherwise one has to change default flavour settings & ubiquity to change wallpaper name.
[14:42] <ogra_> well, thats what we did in the past i think
[14:43] <ogra_> yeah, i agree
[14:45] <pitti> tkamppeter: yes, but not in the temp install for the test suite
[14:45] <pitti> tkamppeter: it's using the local files, not the system installed ones
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[14:46] <tkamppeter> pitti, and it is using the mime files from the system? Or why does it search for urftopdf?
[14:47] <pitti> tkamppeter: that was my next question -- the corresponding mime file should be installed by cups-filters, not cups
[14:48] <pitti> and I don't see any match for "urftopdf" in cups indeed
[14:48] <tkamppeter> pitti, is it linking in the system's filters (from cups-filters) by a series of hard-coded "ln -s ..." commands, needing to be manually updated whenever cups-filters adds a filter?
[14:49] <pitti> tkamppeter: could be; I don't know enough about how that stuff works to know off the top of my head
[14:50] <tkamppeter> pitti, CUPS does not know about urftopdf, cups-filters delivers urftopdf and the appropriate mime entries, so everything what the CUPS package needs to use it.
[14:51] <tkamppeter> pitti, so this is a bug in CUPS-upstream's test suite? Do I have to register every new filter in cups-filters at CUPS upstream that they hard-code its linking into their test-suite?
[14:51] <OdyX> tkamppeter: ah, you need to check debian/patches/tests-use-cupsfilters.patch
[14:51] <OdyX> tkamppeter: yes. It's patched by us to have it work.
[14:51] <OdyX> so just add a line there
[14:52] <pitti> ooh, and then tests will work again, and we can finally upload to Debian experimental?
[14:52] <pitti> I think I saw several requests from Debian to get 1.6

[15:19] <pitti> tkamppeter: awesome! can you please bump the build dep accordingly?
[15:20] <tkamppeter> pitti, I did so already.
[15:23] <OdyX> tkamppeter: you don't need the -3~ for cups-filters (it will fail)
[15:23] <OdyX> tkamppeter: it was needed because I added bc in .24-3 but .25 doesn't have a -3 yet
[15:24] <tkamppeter> OdyX, sorry, I forgot it in one of the two lines. It built for me locally and so I dd not see it.
[15:26] <OdyX> tkamppeter: and did you re-enable the pstops patch ?
[15:26] <tkamppeter> OdyX, no, I did not see that there was a disabled patch.

[15:29] <pitti>         make check
[15:29] <pitti> tkamppeter: ^ do we still need that then?
[15:30] <tkamppeter> pitti, I did not add this. Is "make check" not the defauult call for the self test of an upstream source package?
[15:30] <pitti> that's what I thought
[15:30] <pitti> tkamppeter: presumably it's a leftover from previously disabling the tests with "make check || true"?
[15:32] <tkamppeter> OdyX, pitti, re-activating the pstops patch makes the ipp-2.1.test fail. It should not, if we want to test IPP stuff it should not depend on filter chain priorities.
[15:32] <OdyX> pitti: might be.
[15:32] <OdyX> pitti: yeah, I'd like to have more descriptive changelog entries (and less lists of files there…)

[16:34] <doko> jodh, online?
=== sil2100_ is now known as sil2100
[17:16] <infinity> mahmoh: Promise?
[17:17] <mahmoh> infinity: which?
[17:18] <infinity> mahmoh: That you'll verify this seabios this time. :P
[17:18] <ogra_> beer ?
[17:18] <mahmoh> infinity: yes, I'm properly notified now, 100% or a case of beer for all!
[17:18] <mahmoh> (one case for all to share that is :) )
[17:34] <infinity> xnox: Any progress on tidying up cunit?  The archive's in a mildly inconsistent state until we get this sorted. :/
[17:34] <infinity> xnox: (Since I trusted Jamie's review and promoted everything before noticing the extra dep...)
[17:43] <OdyX> tkamppeter: I'm not convinced that the split is worth the effort, but ohwell.
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio__
=== deryck is now known as deryck[lunch]
[18:02] <xnox> infinity: yeap. I am about finished with partmal-lvm-auto & clashing vg names. And then I'll do cunit. Should be today. I'll ping you about cunit promotion.
=== mcclurmc_away is now known as mcclurmc
=== Caesar_ is now known as Caesar
=== Tonio__ is now known as Tonio_aw
[18:11] <infinity> xnox: Thanks in advance, then. :)
=== mcclurmc is now known as mcclurmc_away
[18:25] <OdyX> tkamppeter: damn. The test suite still fails to purge the control files when built in sbuild.
[18:26] <OdyX> tkamppeter: ah no, even outside of an sbuild now.
[18:26] <OdyX> hrm
=== sabdfl__ is now known as sabdfl
=== statik_ is now known as statik
[18:36] <OdyX> tkamppeter: might it be a crash/timeout of imageto* in cups-filters ?
[18:36] <OdyX> tkamppeter: all the remaining control files here are when it tries to print testfile.jpf
[18:36] <OdyX> jpg
[18:41] <OdyX> tkamppeter: ah, indeed: "/usr/lib/cups/filter/imagetops 1 user 'title' '' '' testfile.jpg > /tmp/test.ps" fails
[18:55] <melodie_> hi
[18:56] <melodie_> xnox, are you still here ? I have done an iso with a new png image added into /usr/share/backgrounds and I was expecting the background for ubiquity gui installer to change color but it didn't, it still stayd black. Would you have another idea ?
[18:56] <melodie_> I paid attention that the name for the png be the same, and the size in pixels as well
[18:57] <melodie_> warty-final-ubuntu.png
[18:57] <melodie_> and also the rights and permissions
[19:01] <OdyX> tkamppeter: would it be possible that cups-filters needs a 1.6 cups to work correctly ? In that case, it would need a bootstrapping in Debian, no ?
=== deryck[lunch] is now known as deryck
[19:24] <OdyX> tkamppeter, pitti : pushed my merge to master, the build fails here because of the control files purge. It get "better" if I install the packages I just built before re-building, so I stand to my "bootstrap" suspicion, but I can't fix that for now. If you have an idea...
[19:27] <OdyX> tkamppeter, pitti : also, I don't get how /etc/default/cups gets installed in libcups2, that's very probably wrong (or needs a Breaks)
[19:39] <infinity> Laney: Did you mean s/good/base/ in your cheese upload?
[19:42] <infinity> Laney: Oh, I see, it's waiting on a split from NEW.
[19:47] <infinity> hallyn: I thought the whole point of this qemu merge was to get us in sync with Debian?  Why the Ubuntu upload?  Are we still stuck with a delta for some reason?
[20:06] <hallyn> infinity: we have a ubuntu delta because:
[20:06] <hallyn> 1. we have some arm and gridcentric patches which are not yet upstream
[20:06] <hallyn> 2. we need some changes to deal with our old package layouts (to obsolete them)
[20:07] <hallyn> 3. there are some things we can't have in main
[20:07] <hallyn> infinity: the debdiff from debian is actually pretty small though
[20:08] <hallyn> infinity: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1496902/  the debdiff from debian to ubuntu
[20:16] <infinity> hallyn: I'd push for some of these to just be in the Debian package to make merging easier (like the Breaks/Replaces on qemu-common, doesn't hurt to have it in Debian)
[20:16] <infinity> hallyn: Same with the breaks/replaces on qemu-kvm.  (and we could keep theirs as well)
=== tdc_ is now known as tdc
[20:17] <infinity> hallyn: The transitional packages, perhaps they don't want, but even that wouldn't hurt, and lets people more easily test and sidegrade.  But that's not even remotely a supported thing to do, so meh.
[20:18] <hallyn> i can ping Michael Tokarev to see if he's amenable
[20:19] <infinity> hallyn: The bits where we differ in /etc might be nice to try to converge on as well at some point.
[20:19] <hallyn> infinity: yes - i'm not sure whether they actually use what they ahve or not
[20:22] <infinity> hallyn: (other than /etc and debian/control bits, the rest seems sane to have as a delta for now, I concede the point... At least we're getting closer)
[20:22] <hallyn> infinity: i'll start by trying to break the debdiff into meaningful chunks (the bottom bits of which would be pushed to debian) at github.com/hallyn/qemu
[20:22] <hallyn> infinity: esp since this also (almost) gets rid of qemu-linaro
[20:50] <jbicha> hallyn: "things we can't have in main" = spice ? are there reasons for that posted somewhere?
[20:50] <hallyn> jbicha: it's also vde2
[20:51] <hallyn> there is a spice MIR bug which should have the rationale for the nack for main
[20:51] <hallyn> mainly it depends on libs which are duplicates of what is already in main, and not particularly trusted
[20:53] <jbicha> hallyn: I've tried searching but I can't find a spice mir
[20:53] <jbicha> I also am wondering why spice-protocol is in main
[20:53] <melodie_> xnox, if you are still around, this is what I get : http://meets.free.fr/debian/images/ubiquity-frontend-gtk-look.png
[20:54] <hallyn> jbicha: the libraries in question were cegui-mk2 xerces-c2 ois devil allegro4.2 dialog svgalib freeimage
[20:54] <jbicha> oh, nm I guess xserver-xorg-video-qxl pulls it in
[20:54] <melodie_> the blue image around is what I have put into the wallapers directory, but how can I get the ubiquity windows itself to have the right colors ? at least something clear and readable ?
[21:02] <jbicha> hallyn: is that still the case? I'm having trouble finding those libraries in the spice source
[21:03] <hallyn> jbicha: then it might be worth revisiting
[21:03] <jbicha> part of why I'm asking is because a friend has to workaround bug 975165
[21:03] <ubottu> bug 962376 in qemu-kvm-spice (Ubuntu) "duplicate for #975165 spicevmc not supported in QEMU binary" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/962376
[21:04] <hallyn> jbicha: i'd be very happy to just have spice in main.  do you want to open a new MIR for it?
[21:05] <jbicha> hallyn: sure I can start the paperwork :)
[21:09] <hallyn> jbicha: awesome, thanks!
[22:10] <melodie_> which version of Ubuntu does this one ubiquity-dm belong to ?
[22:10] <melodie_> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-installer/ubiquity/trunk/view/head:/bin/ubiquity-dm#L564
[22:11] <melodie_> the one for Precise seems not to be the same ? http://pastebin.com/z4JiC5NK
[22:13] <melodie_> I am trying to find out how to get a background with a decent color in the window of the ubiquity gtk frontend, and can only have a black background (a remix I'm trying to do) here is a pic : http://meets.free.fr/debian/images/ubiquity-frontend-gtk-look.png
[22:13] <melodie_> any idea how I could fix it ?
[22:58] <melodie_> good night
[23:30] <vadi2> How would I go about asking for a package that was updated in Debian to be updated in Ubuntu+1?
[23:31] <xnox> vadi2: which package?
[23:31] <vadi2> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/quantal/+source/mudlet
[23:33] <xnox> vadi2: it's fully up to date, https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mudlet
[23:33] <xnox> in raring.
[23:33] <xnox> if you want a backport to previous releases, !backports
[23:33] <xnox> !backports
[23:33] <ubottu> If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they may go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports - See also !packaging
[23:33] <vadi2> Ah. Thank you.
