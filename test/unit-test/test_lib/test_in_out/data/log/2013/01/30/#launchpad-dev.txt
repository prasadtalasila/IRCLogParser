[00:05] <StevenK> Fighting with Chromium
[00:06] <StevenK> Because Firebug hates our test pages
[00:06] <wallyworld> :-(
[00:10] <StevenK> wallyworld: form_node.one('#tag-input:focus');
[00:11] <StevenK> Sigh
[00:11] <StevenK> wallyworld: form_node.one('#tag-input:focus'); == null
[00:11] <wallyworld> StevenK: so perhaps something else is being assigned focus
[00:11] <StevenK> Or the test is braindead
[00:11] <wallyworld> StevenK: you could attach an onblur event handler to the tag-input node and log something so that you can see if focus is being lost
[00:12] <wallyworld> or the test ia dead, yes
[00:12] <wallyworld> at least activeElement and :focus are behaving consistently
[00:13] <wallyworld> StevenK: i haven't the code handy, but perhaps autocomplete render is messing with the focus
[00:13] <StevenK> It could have focus rather than the text box
[00:13] <StevenK> I guess
[00:14] <StevenK> If :focus works, I just have to Y.Assert.isNotNull();  -- I hope that, or something like it exists
[00:15] <wallyworld> yes, it exists, can't recall the exact syntax
[00:15] <wallyworld> my brain is rotten
[00:21] <StevenK> Y.one('.bug-tag-complete:focus') is also null
[00:22] <StevenK> Y.one(':focus'); is also null
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:29] <StevenK> wallyworld: So I'm not sure if :focus works either
[00:30] <wallyworld> hmmm
[00:31] <wallyworld> can you fire up an instance, and click on an input field and then in firebug type a css expression to see if it selects the field you just clicked?
[00:32] <wallyworld> ah won't work
[00:32] <wallyworld> since clicking out of the input takes away focus
[00:43] <StevenK> Hmmm, I think the <form> is activeElement now
[00:43] <StevenK> With a id of 'tag-input'
[00:43] <StevenK> That might even be success
[00:44] <StevenK> Expected: [object HTMLInputElement] (object)
[00:44] <StevenK> Actual: INPUT#tag-input yui_3_5_1_1_1359506644965_424 (object)
[00:45] <StevenK> But from my reading in the debugger, the _yuid's are the same
[00:45] <wallyworld> Actual aboce is correct
[00:46] <StevenK> wallyworld: Expected is document.activeElement, tag_input is the actual
[00:46] <wallyworld> i think the assert is comparing the DOM node wityh a YUI node perhaps
[00:46] <StevenK> Right
[00:46] <wallyworld> so you need to "convert" the document,activeElement to the YUI node
[00:46] <wallyworld> there's a YUI.DOM method for that
[00:47] <wallyworld> from memory
[00:48] <StevenK> % bzr grep YUI.DOM | wc -l
[00:48] <StevenK> 0
[00:49] <StevenK> -i helps not
[00:49] <wallyworld> let me check
[00:49] <wgrant> Don't you just give it to the YUI.Node constructor?
[00:49] <wgrant> IIRC
[00:50] <wallyworld> StevenK: Y.one() accepts a DOM element from memory
[00:50] <wallyworld> and returns the YUI node
[00:50] <StevenK> Let's see
[00:51] <StevenK> No failures!
[00:52] <wallyworld> \o/
[00:52] <StevenK> NoCanonicalUrl: No url for u'http://blueprints.launchpad.dev/product-name-100004' because u'http://blueprints.launchpad.dev/product-name-100004' broke the chain.
[00:53] <StevenK> canonical_url, I hate you
[00:53] <wgrant> That's a string
[00:53] <wgrant> You can't take the URL of a string
[00:53] <StevenK> url = canonical_url(product, rootsite='blueprints')
[00:53] <wgrant> product is the URL
[00:53] <wgrant> Not a product
[00:53] <StevenK> product = self.factory.makeProduct()
[00:53] <wgrant> I suspect
[00:53] <wgrant> You sure it's failing on that line?
[00:54] <StevenK> Oh, god damn it, getViewBrowser
[00:54] <StevenK> I hate you, please die in a fire
[01:19] <wgrant> StevenK: Looking
[01:20] <wgrant> StevenK: Why'd you remove the first assert?
[01:20] <wgrant> And why do you get form_node, rather than going straight to #tag-input?
[01:21] <StevenK> wgrant: Compare line 19 and 22
[01:21] <wgrant> Ah, true
[01:21] <StevenK> I can go straight to #tag-input, but I wanted to be sure it was the unhidden form's node
[01:22] <wgrant> If there's a duplicate ID that has focus then there are probably bigger problems
[01:22] <wgrant> 'cause both of those requirements are problems
[01:23] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1587567/
[01:23] <wgrant> StevenK: You can probably inline that now
[01:25] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1587573/
[01:25] <wgrant> Much better.
[01:25] <StevenK> The line is too long with Y.one(document.activeElement), so that can stay outside as the var

[01:36] <wgrant> What did you do?
[01:36] <StevenK> No wonder my query count is tiny, I'm not invalidating the cache
[01:39] <StevenK> Hmmm, that doesn't help
[03:14] <StevenK> And I switch to c_i_v() and the query count drops to 17. WTF.
[03:15] <wgrant> StevenK: Did you actually render the view?
[03:25] <StevenK> view() should do that, no?
[03:25] <wgrant> Yes
[03:31] <StevenK> Oh, HAH
[03:31] <StevenK> official_blueprints
[03:31] <StevenK> STAB
[03:31] <wgrant> Heh
[03:34] <StevenK> sudo dpkg -P hayfever
[03:37] <StevenK> Hm, blueprints.l.d/product is only showing 5
[03:37] <wgrant> Right, batch size on launchpad.dev is 5 by default
[03:41] <StevenK> I think my test is slighly broken
[03:42] <StevenK> The query list shows an INSERT INTO specification
[03:43]  * StevenK peers at the oops attached to 1108261
[03:44] <StevenK> The sreg_info we got back was None?
[03:44] <wgrant> Or not present at all, more likely
[03:44] <wgrant> Which possibly means that the user tried to authenticate with an SSO account that had no LP account, or somehow convince SSO not to send the info
[03:46] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1587769/ the rest of the changes (ISpecification.linked_branches cachedproperty and preloading are shelved)
[06:26] <wgrant> StevenK: You need to check that the query count is constant, because a query count of 35 for 5 specs could easily include 3 queries for each spec.
[06:27] <wgrant> so eg. create one, check query count, create another 4, check query count is still the same
[06:29]  * StevenK peers at this test
[06:29] <StevenK> I think getViewBrowser screws with the interaction
[06:34] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1588354/
[06:37] <wgrant> StevenK: That looks more test-like, though I'm not sure about having that query count hardcoded in a generically-named method :)
[07:13] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1588558/
[07:19] <wgrant> StevenK: Have you considered BrowsesWithQueryLimit?
[07:19] <wgrant> That might even handle invalidation for you
[07:23] <StevenK> Doesn't look like it handles invalidation

[15:36] <mgz> ah, hadn't realised there was a wiki.ubuntu.com page, I put 'em on the canonical one
[15:36] <czajkowski> nods
[15:36] <czajkowski> community one is public :)
[15:36] <czajkowski> now to poke the canonical folks to add their details there
[15:38] <mgz> global poke'd
[15:39] <czajkowski> cheers
[15:39] <czajkowski> mgz: http://www.drugopera.be/
[15:39] <czajkowski> very close to delierium  then for friday night beers

[15:41] <czajkowski> indeed
[15:41] <czajkowski> but is within the perdiem also
[15:41] <czajkowski> easily
[15:45] <czajkowski> mgz: oh this also means I finally get to meet jelmer
[15:45] <mgz> wait, you've never met 'im?
[15:45] <czajkowski> NO!
[15:45] <czajkowski> I joined the month  after the sprint
[15:45] <czajkowski> :(
[15:48] <mgz> he's coming to london immediately after and settling in :)
[15:49] <czajkowski> aye
[15:49] <czajkowski> has he found a place to live?
[15:49] <mgz> has a place arranged for the first month or so and will start looking for something longer term
[15:50] <czajkowski> cool

[15:50] <czajkowski> cannot wait
[15:55] <mgz> don't eat the geeks!

[23:37] <StevenK> wgrant: https://code.launchpad.net/~stevenk/launchpad/precache-specification-linked-branches/+merge/145544 has updated
[23:39] <wgrant> StevenK: You still need the explicit invalidate?
[23:39] <wgrant> Also, the "specs" list is not useful at all
[23:39] <wgrant> You only read from it to get the store to invalidate, and you can get that from product just as easily
[23:42] <StevenK> wgrant: The test passes without the invalidate
[23:42] <StevenK> But I'm still not convinced it invalidates the store
[23:43] <wgrant> Looks like you're right
[23:44] <StevenK> I could make it do so, but that may have far reaching implications
[23:46] <wgrant> Anyway, I guess that means you should eliminate the specs var and I will be happy :)
[23:47] <StevenK> I've already done so: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1591256/
[23:47] <wgrant> Much better :)
[23:49] <StevenK> wgrant: I'm happy to make BrowsesWithQueryLimit invalidate the store in a seperate branch and toss it at ec2
[23:52] <wgrant> StevenK: That might be worth a try
[23:54] <StevenK> wgrant: The MP is updated
