[07:00] <Kilos> s/las/last/
[07:05] <magespawn> you can try memtest
[07:09] <Kilos> i have and it goes through without any errors, that what is confusing
[07:10] <Kilos> and it is so time consuming
[07:18] <magespawn> yup i do not know of software that can accurately test a mb
[07:20] <Kilos> hi jrgns

[07:33] <playmonkey> clean the cache for what?
[07:34] <Kilos> so the browser doesnt remember where it went
[07:34] <playmonkey> oh that is not a problem.
[07:34] <playmonkey> the problem is the connection goes through a network that is out of my control
[07:34] <Kilos> ah
[07:35] <playmonkey> [PC] <> [PROXY] <> [ISP] <> [WEB]
[07:35] <Kilos> so it can be monitored while working?
[07:35] <playmonkey> yup
[07:35] <Kilos> ai

[08:17] <Vince-0> baai
[08:17] <Vince-0> oh, too late
[08:18] <Kilos> quick hey
[09:30] <Kilos> hi N8Wulf 
[09:31] <N8Wulf> hey Uncle Kilos
[09:31] <N8Wulf> Fridaayyyy
[09:31] <Kilos> haha
[09:38] <superfly> afternoon
[09:38] <Kilos> hi superfly 
[09:45] <N8Wulf> what's the kde groups name again pls?
[09:46] <N8Wulf> (blush)
[09:46] <Kilos> lol
[09:46] <superfly> kde group?
[09:46] <Kilos> ask superfly and inetpro 
[09:46] <N8Wulf> #ubuntu-kde non comprende vous
[09:46] <superfly> #kubuntu
[09:46] <N8Wulf> Dankie dankie
[09:49] <inetpro> N8Wulf, Kilos: why?
[09:49] <Kilos> he needs some kde info of course
[09:49] <Kilos> you winning inetpro ?
[09:50] <N8Wulf> stuck with something small: how do I switch Workspaces? with gnome I pressed Cntrl+Alt & Left /right
[09:50] <Kilos> i click in that block of workspaces bottom left
[09:51] <N8Wulf> and to move a App we "normally" press Ctrl+Alt+Shift and Left/Right... Kilos... Clicking is for Windows users
[09:51] <Kilos> lol
[09:51] <superfly> N8Wulf: I set mine up to use Super+Alt+Left/Right
[09:51] <superfly> N8Wulf: you can set all of that up... let me quickly see...
[09:52] <superfly> N8Wulf: btw, don't forget Alt+F2
[09:53] <superfly> N8Wulf: System Settings -> Shortcuts & Gestures -> Global Keyboard Shortcuts, Select "KWin" as the component, and Bob's your uncle!
[09:53] <superfly> Meta = Super = Windows key
[09:55] <charl_> good morning
[09:55] <charl_> Maaz: coffee on
[09:55]  * Maaz starts grinding coffee
[09:57]  * inetpro is happy with all in one workspace and simply Alt+Tab for switching between apps and Alt+F2 to start new apps
[09:58] <inetpro> not sure why anyone would want different workspaces, but that's just me
[09:59] <Maaz> Coffee's ready for charl_!
[09:59] <inetpro> if I really want to move stuff to a 2nd desktop I just switch with Ctrl+F1,F2,Fx
[10:00] <Kilos> see N8Wulf the kde guys here are clever
[10:01] <N8Wulf> one reason being that I run IRC on my right hand workspace, my browser on the bottom workspace and then the rest in my Main workspace. then when I need to switch quickly between the 15 open Apps, I dont need to Alt-Tab 32 times
[10:02] <inetpro> 15 open apps? Why?
[10:03] <inetpro> superfly: by the way, my super key is not working by default, is there anywhere you need to enable it?
[10:04]  * inetpro goes to google it
[10:07] <inetpro> hmm... 
[10:07] <inetpro> the key definitely works when I set it to launch the KMenu
[10:08] <inetpro> but shortcuts defined in above mentioned settings don't do what they should be doing
[10:08] <N8Wulf> thanx guys
[10:08] <inetpro> N8Wulf: working?
[10:08] <Kilos> inetpro, i asked you if you are winning with you move to new hardware
[10:08] <inetpro> Kilos: I'm always winning
[10:09] <Kilos> except when youre sukkeling
[10:09] <Kilos> hehe
[10:10] <inetpro> Kilos: it will take some time in between many other daily challenges, we're sorting out the memory tonight
[10:12] <Kilos> whew long hours hey
[10:12] <Kilos> shame
[10:12] <Kilos> keep us informed though
[10:22] <N8Wulf> Heeelpp... Server 12.10 , I'm trying to edit the resolv.conf but I see that it is dynamically managed by resolvconf
[10:23] <N8Wulf> so how do I change the DNS server in the resolv.conf? pleas someone
[10:27] <N8Wulf> the mighty Google has spoken
[10:27] <N8Wulf> http://askubuntu.com/questions/157154/how-do-i-add-changes-resolv-conf-without-getting-overwritten
[10:54] <magespawn> bbl
[10:54] <Kilos> k
[11:14] <N8Wulf> What's for Lunch gents?
[11:20] <inetpro> N8Wulf: i just noticed that steers dropped their prices
[11:21] <inetpro> with combo meals
[11:21] <inetpro> for*
[11:23] <N8Wulf> Greek Salad with lots of Feta... made by Fruit and Veg
[11:23] <inetpro> nice!
[11:24] <N8Wulf> indeed... and Big Bananas for pudding
[11:27] <Kilos> lol
[11:28] <Kilos> what is a caterpillar in afrikaans
[11:29] <Kilos> http://code.google.com/apis/language/translate/overview.html
[11:29] <Kilos> dont work that link
[11:29] <Kilos> goes to google developers
[11:31] <superfly> inetpro: probably because you're already using the Super key as a dedicated shortcut for something else
[11:40] <inetpro> superfly: I don't actually, have never used it since using kubuntu... ok perhaps not never
[11:41]  * inetpro is used to many default kde shortcuts without needing the super key
[11:53] <N8Wulf> Any Geniuses in the house for Lamp Server installation?
[11:55] <N8Wulf> Using this: sudo tasksel install lamp-server  I'm supposed to get a Prompt to create a MySql password, but this never happened. Should I remove and reInstall or can I set the PW in another way?
[11:56] <superfly> N8Wulf: google it, there are tons of blog posts out there on how to reset your MySQL admin password
[11:56] <superfly> s/admin/root/
[11:56] <N8Wulf> tanx
[12:11] <Squirm> good afternoon
[12:14]  * Squirm pops in
[12:16] <N8Wulf> afternoon Squirm
[12:16] <Squirm> hello N8Wulf, superfly 
[12:19] <N8Wulf> pls point me in the right direction.. busy setting up a smei headless box. I have to run a Webbrowser on the box as part of the setup, so I'm installing LXDE quickly. Do I have to run the LXDE first, then something like VNC-Server so that I can connect remotelly/
[12:19] <N8Wulf> ?
[12:19] <N8Wulf> *don't ask me what a "smei" is, typo
[12:21] <inetpro> you're doing it wrong
[12:21] <inetpro> a web server should never require a gui
[12:22] <N8Wulf> http://docs.moodle.org/20/en/Step-by-step_Installation_Guide_for_Ubuntu
[12:22] <N8Wulf> just above the Step for Setup a virtual server
[12:24] <inetpro> remind me to never install Moodle
[12:25] <N8Wulf> which brings me back to my Q... some kind of remote X possible?
[12:26] <inetpro> N8Wulf: try using a text browser
[12:27] <inetpro> no gui needed
[12:27] <inetpro> elinks, links, lynx or any other
[12:33] <N8Wulf> good idea.. will let you know
[13:12] <Squirm> and N8Wulf, it is possible to have a remote X session
[13:12] <Squirm> just don't ask me how to do it :P
[13:12] <Squirm> only way I know of is ss -x
[13:13] <N8Wulf> will read up on that one thanx for the tip
[13:13] <Squirm> well, ssh -X
[13:13] <Squirm> it brings an X application through ssh.
[13:13] <N8Wulf> ow COOL
[13:47] <inetpro> I would however stay away from installing X components on a server
[13:47] <inetpro> the only thing that is sometimes needed is libraries
[14:02] <superfly> if you need something like X, use Xvfb
[14:13] <charl_> i find it hard to believe that there is now an ubuntu derivative that is actually called "descentos"
[14:13] <charl_> http://www.descentos.org/
[14:13] <charl_> how unoriginal can you get
[14:14] <charl_> (i'm not criticising the distro by the way, just the name...)
[15:00] <N8Wulf> have a gr8 weekend all
