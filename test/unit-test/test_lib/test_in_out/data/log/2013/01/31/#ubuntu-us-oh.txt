[05:07] <trkmstrwggy> hii
[05:08] <trkmstrwggy> how goes it?
[15:28] <andygraybeal> hey i found this thought it was cool: http://www.thefanclub.co.za/node/50
[15:28] <andygraybeal> but you guys probably already know that stuff
[15:28] <andygraybeal> about securing ubutnu
[15:30] <paultag> ufw, yick.
[15:30] <paultag> neat guide, though
[15:33] <jrgifford> ufw isn't *bad*
[15:33] <paultag> it's not good :)
[15:33] <jrgifford> it just could be better.
[15:33] <paultag> and it's not *U* either
[15:33] <paultag> iptables is a better solution
[15:34] <jrgifford> i'm lazy, while i like iptables, this is easier for me.
[15:34] <jrgifford> (for my laptop)
[17:50] <thafreak> seriously?
[17:51] <thafreak> ufw is pretty great for the vast majority of cases...
[17:51] <thafreak> I want to block all ports except for x
[17:51] <thafreak> what's better than ufw for that?
[17:52] <thafreak> paultag is just jealous he didn't write ufw
[18:09] <paultag> bleh
[19:34] <thafreak> canthus13:
[19:34] <thafreak> hey
[19:34] <thafreak> canthus13:
[19:34] <thafreak> hey
[19:34] <thafreak> canthus13:
[19:38] <Unit193> Ues /eval, you can spam so much faster! :D
[19:39] <thafreak> THE GAME    <--- what canthus13 just lost...(or will lose eventually)
[19:40] <paultag> FFFFUCK
[19:40] <thafreak> like you have room to talk
[19:40] <thafreak> every time I see you even post on facebook, I lose
[19:41] <thafreak> because I remember what you normally do here
[19:44]  * canthus13 stabs thafreak with an outdated CCNA study guide.
[19:45] <thafreak> oooh burn...
[19:45]  * thafreak has an outdated CCNA study guide...
[19:45]  * thafreak blocks canthus13
[19:45] <canthus13> Mine comes in 2 volumes. :P
[19:46] <thafreak> mine wighs about 10lbs
[19:46]  * thafreak is actually horrible at estimating things like weight, distance, volume, etc
[19:46]  * canthus13 forcefeeds his entire windows 2000 MCSE binder collection. (Over 3000 value!)
[20:03] <thafreak> AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
[20:03] <thafreak> Fun fact....a sysadmin who sets up a system, instantly becomes an expert on said system
[20:04] <thafreak> and can then tell you WHY the system behaves the way it does without ever looking at any of the several thousand lines of code
[20:26] <thafreak> by system, I mean piece of software actually
[20:26] <thafreak> i installed this java web app...so I get asked why it's not doing such and such...
[20:33] <thafreak> What's the loco
[20:33] <thafreak> the loco's take on this: https://www.artemis.net/what-is-secure/
[20:43] <Cheri703> first instinct is that it's a gimmick
[20:50] <thafreak> yeah, most people say that whenever I mention any TLD that's not .com or .net
[20:51] <thafreak> I like the fact that they do extensive human identity checks on all registrants, and require everyone to use TLS for everything
[20:51] <Cheri703> well, the idea of "we're super secure, omg trust us!" when it's all voluntary that people sign up anyway...I dunno, it just seems pointless. Unless you're ONLY going to use THEIR websites, and NOTHING ELSE on the internet, then...why?
[20:52] <thafreak> I think it's more of a, wow, this is a .secure site, I know that I can trust any data I send them to be secured in flight
[20:53] <thafreak> and I know I can find the human person behind the site if my data isn't secured after it gets there
[20:53] <Cheri703> I guess
[21:13] <canthus13> ...I thought my van was stolen. Called the cops and everything.  Somehow in my delerium this morning (i'm rather sick), I drove to the store around the corner, got a drink, and walked home. o.o
[21:13] <Cheri703> :/ at least it wasn't stolen
[21:13] <canthus13> yeah... Kit is on the phone retracting the police report right now. :/
[21:14] <thafreak> and filing a new one... canthus13 was driving under the influence of influenza
[21:15] <canthus13> Heh.
