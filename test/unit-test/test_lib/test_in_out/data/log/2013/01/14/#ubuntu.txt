[00:00] <judahitewarrior7> I have Ubuntu 12.10 and I have problems switching to different Hebrew fonts in LibreOffice Writer. It will not switch from the default Hebrew font Lohit Hindi. Can anyone please help?
[00:00] <demonio1> thanks PatrickDickey ubottu i'll see they now :)
[00:01] <sybariten> PatrickDickey: when using lubuntu, will i be using the same repositories as someone using ubuntu? (mind you, i'm no wizard of package management)
[00:01] <dr_willis> sybariten:  yes
[00:01] <sybariten> PatrickDickey: in other words: will i have the same big choice of software, or will there be restrictions
[00:01] <dr_willis> its just a differnt desktop on top of the core of the os
[00:01] <PatrickDickey> sybariten: yes, and in fact, you can install ubuntu-desktop afterwards.
[00:02] <sybariten> aha ok
[00:02] <PatrickDickey> judahitewarrior7: You might find more help in #libreoffice or #ubuntu-il
[00:03] <demonio1> PatrickDickey ubottu just a faster question the filesystem /usr/bin is different that /etc?
[00:03] <PatrickDickey> demonio1: You'll probably want to Google Linux Filesystem for more information.
[00:03] <dr_willis> demonio1:  you partion a hard drive. then put a filesystem on the partion.  /usr and /etc are directories
[00:03] <dr_willis> demonio1:  the wikipedia may be handy to read up on also
[00:04] <dr_willis> partion a hd -> format the partions to be whatever filesystem you need them to be.
[00:04] <jazzkutya> ubottu's entry for !filesystem is pretty much misleading here
[00:04]  * PatrickDickey is off to work now. :S
[00:04] <buntuBen> sybariten, I just downloaded 12.04 64-bit today from ubuntu.com, it comes out at 728MB

[00:07] <dr_willis> demonio1:  no need to msg me./  i tend to ignore most messages
[00:07] <dr_willis> demonio1:  and linux supports dozens of filesystem types.
[00:08] <BillyZane|2> hey dr_willis :)
[00:08] <demonio1> ok dr_willis but can u do an example of filesystem?
[00:08] <demonio1> pls
[00:09] <BillyZane|2> demonio1: hi
[00:09] <demonio1> hi BillyZane|2 :)
[00:09] <BillyZane|2> demonio1:  i might be wrong on this, but ext3 and ext4 are the main partitions you want to install ubuntu on. regarding what file systems are supported for mounting purposes, i can verify that NTFS is supportorted, and probably Fat32
[00:10] <BillyZane|2> you can't view ext3 and ext4 on windows, but you can view NTFS on linux

[00:15] <ikonia> Nimrod2012: yes, thre are various solutions to secure boot and linux in general, with various pros/cons
[00:15] <JonEdney> So apparently (without noticing), I set the "System Reserved" portion of the Windows partition as boot.  I've never seen what is normaly set as bootable, is it the / partition?

[00:51] <TradeFortress> I looked in access logs and error logs
[00:51] <TradeFortress> But it was missing a whole day.

[00:55] <daftykins> TradeFortress: if nobody logged in on the 12th, auth.log would have nothing?
[00:55] <daftykins> islan: on Windows i mean :> link me and i'll try and help
[00:55] <TradeFortress> daftykins: but I logged in on the 12th..
[00:55] <islan> ohh, I have to do it on Windows?
[00:55] <daftykins> islan: easiest way imo
[00:55] <TradeFortress> and the server was hacked on the 12th given mysql timestamps
[00:56] <daftykins> TradeFortress: that's what i was asking. sounds like someone edited your logs then perhaps
[00:56] <islan> daftykins, this should be the driver: http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/GetDriver/InitiateSingleFileDownload?fileId=3080878754&driverId=F9WG9&isInstallAvailable=False&isKCSArticleTobeShown=False&categoryId=CM&returnUrl=%2Fsupport%2Fdrivers%2Fus%2Fen%2F19%2FProduct%2Finspiron-15-3520%3FretrieveState%3DTrue&isUSDownload=true

[00:57] <TradeFortress> does that mean they got in the server? or failed to connect?

[00:58] <TradeFortress> Or not.
[00:58] <JonEdney> TradeFortress, what log file is that from?  That's a pretty generic entry.
[00:59] <daftykins> TradeFortress: it means whoever was connected, disconnected... be it a connection attempt fraudulently or successfully. the message is pretty obvious
[00:59] <TradeFortress> JonEdney: it is from auth.log
[01:00] <JonEdney> TradeFortress, it's a general disconnected entry as daftykins mentioned.
[01:00] <JonEdney> What kind of precautions are you using on your server to swirve hack attempts?

[01:05] <JonEdney> harris, you should be able to select Wine as a default application?
[01:05] <Guest88142> yeah but my default install took 8 gig could I reduce it to maybe 4 or 2 gig I only surf internet e-mail play some light games and tinker with inkscape and lmms
[01:05] <BONG_IT> theres ab error
[01:05] <usr13> harris: Since MS Office is not a native application, I think you'll just have to start MS Office first and then open the file.
[01:05] <JonEdney> Guest88142, swap is for when your PC/laptop hibernates, so it can save your current used RAM.
[01:06] <Guest88142> I don't do either
[01:06] <JonEdney> I've heard that if you should match it if you have under 8 GBs.
[01:06] <usr13> Guest88142: How large is your HD?
[01:06] <JonEdney> I don't hibernate, I have 8 GB RAM, I do not use swap space.
[01:06] <harris> i right clicked properites and open with a wine application when i double click nothing happens
[01:06] <Guest88142> my hd is 32gig
[01:06] <JonEdney> harris, because MS Office is working through Wine, you may not be able to link it as a default program.
[01:07] <usr13> JonEdney: There is not a good reason not to.
[01:07] <harris> i could in 9.04
[01:07] <Guest88142> if thats how its gotta be thats ok I was just wondering
[01:08] <JonEdney> I've never ran into an issue with no swap space *shrugs
[01:08] <usr13> Guest88142: That's a pretty small HD
[01:08] <Guest88142> well I know there has to be some
[01:08] <julian-delphiki> well, you don't really *need* swap, its just very useful if you have a small amount of ram

[01:12] <JonEdney> TradeFortress, there would be a log entry with an IP that indicated connected, just as the one that said disconnected.

[01:17] <wesam_> buntuBen: It's awn, but I tried this before and when booting, it just froze at "Booting from onboard CD: _"
[01:17] <bunjee> can I convert TG file to ISO?
[01:17] <ikonia> that's not a question
[01:17] <julian-delphiki> bunjee... TG = tuxguitar, right?
[01:18] <bunjee> sorry......RAR archive
[01:18] <buntuBen> wesame_: try burning at slowest write speed possible, and use burnproof.
[01:18] <winterpk> good morning
[01:18] <julian-delphiki> bunjee, extract the rar, make new archive, burn to disk?
[01:18] <bunjee> yes....no clue how to
[01:19] <wesam_> buntuBen: I already started it.. But it seems stuck at finalizing like it did before. Should it be going this slow?
[01:19] <wesam_> It says 100% done, finalizing.
[01:19] <wesam_> The loading bar is the bouncing thing.
[01:19] <winterpk> This isn't exactly Ubuntu related but I'm having trouble with a serverbuild in which I'm planning on installing ubuntu on.  My problem is that the hard drives are not showing up in the bios. I've zero'd and formatted them.  Does anyone know what I might be missing?
[01:19] <ikonia> winterpk: try ##hardware
[01:20] <daftykins> winterpk: in BIOS? PATA/SATA?
[01:20] <ikonia> winterpk: we only deal with ubuntu issues here
[01:20] <winterpk> SATA in bios
[01:20] <wesam_> winterpk: Check your BIOS up and down. But yeah, ##hardware is where you should go.
[01:20] <winterpk> sorry ikonia
[01:20] <buntuBen> wesame_: does it sound like your cd is still spinning, or did it spin down?
[01:20] <daftykins> winterpk: so i take it by extension, the OSs you boot never see them?
[01:20] <winterpk> I've checked everywhere, just not showing up.  I'll head to HW channel.  Thanks for pointing me in the rigth direction guys!
[01:20] <wesam_> buntuBen: It's wesam_. And Yeah, its spinning, so I guess it's still going.
=== zz_uni4dfx is now known as uni4dfx
[01:21] <winterpk> daft: I have no OS yet, and bios doesn't see them at all
[01:21] <buntuBen> wesam_:my mistake, and yes, I would let it continue. If you told it to verify after burning that might take a while too
[01:22] <daftykins> winterpk: i'd ignore that and see what liveCDs see
[01:23] <julian-delphiki> daftykins... there is no way the OS will see them if bios does not
[01:23] <daftykins> julian-delphiki: not often true in rare circumstances.
[01:23] <SaschaP> ok... amarok does not even start
[01:24] <islan> daftykins, so do you think I should just install 64-bit Ubuntu and try this other work-around?
[01:24] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: it sounds like you have issues with your install, maybe
[01:24] <daftykins> islan: i'm seconds away now.
[01:25] <harris> what are the menues in the top left corner called
[01:25] <ikonia> islan: I suggest resolving your hardware issues before looking at software
[01:25] <ikonia> islan: sorry, wrong guy
[01:25] <islan> daftykins, I'm worried with what you'll find with that file size
[01:25] <SaschaP> julian-delphiki; yes, my phonon makes problems (system: ubuntu 12.04, upgraded to this version on friday, xfce-desktop)
[01:25] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: you could reinstall xubuntu?
[01:25] <daftykins> islan: most of the time it has every version under teh sun, then you can chop out the Windows driver easy. do you happen to know which Windows versions driver works best with ndiswrapper though? newer?
[01:26] <islan> dafty, I guess, some have reported it not working, others have reported it working
[01:26] <SaschaP> julian-delphiki: it's ubuntu with xfce and reinstall? i only upgraded from 11.10 to 12.04 on friday
[01:26] <daftykins> islan: Dell 1704?
[01:27] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: considering 12.10 is current... it's worth a shot
[01:27] <julian-delphiki> or even upgrading to 12.10
[01:27] <islan> dafty, yep, that's the Dell name anyway
[01:27] <islan> daftykins, it's really a Broadcom BCM 43142
[01:27] <daftykins> islan: sure, just extracting now
[01:27] <islan> thanks a bunch!
[01:27] <SaschaP> julian-delphiki: why should i overinstall a lts with a testing version?
[01:28] <daftykins> islan: hrmm other decision, is 32 or 64-bit
[01:29] <islan> dafty, I'm running 32-bit ubuntu
[01:29] <daftykins> islan: yeah, i'll guess with 32 then :S
[01:29] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: 12.10 is not testing...
[01:29] <daftykins> islan: you don't know any free file hosting sites do you? :D
[01:30] <islan> daftykins, um, dropbox?
[01:30] <wesam_> h
[01:30] <getschomp545> i switched to VT, and its asking me for a loginâ€¦used the login which i use to login to ubuntu, but keep receiving "login incorrect"
[01:30] <wesam_> Okay, working. buntuBen: It's still going on, man.
[01:31] <SaschaP> i have a philosophy: never use the last so called "stable" version of a system... it everytime worked with windows :P ... and the problem seems to be something in the glib or qt-area
[01:31] <daftykins> islan: PM'd you a link
[01:31] <SaschaP> and this problem makes me really began to relove windows XP...
[01:31] <SaschaP> or my 11.10
[01:31] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: and you're sure you're up to date on updates?
[01:31] <SaschaP> yes, julian
[01:32] <wesam_> SachaP: sudo apt-get upgrade usually fixes all your problems.
[01:32] <wesam_> and then a nice apt-get upgrade.
[01:32] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: could try reinstalling the packages.
[01:33] <Xorifelse> Can anyone here help resolve my issue with grub/burg? It does not seem to load the interface, just the o.s. selection screen
[01:33] <SaschaP> julian, if i try to purge phonon or gstreamer, the apt-get asks me to delete half of my system... including things like libreoffice
[01:33] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: don't purge then? apt-get install --reinstall phonon gstreamer
[01:34] <Xorifelse> apt-get purge "package"
[01:34] <julian-delphiki> Xorifelse: no.
[01:34] <julian-delphiki> Xorifelse: what is burg?
[01:34] <Xorifelse> Uuhm.
[01:34] <Xorifelse> That is an grub boot loader
[01:34] <julian-delphiki> ah ok
[01:34] <IdleOne> Xorifelse: try #grub or #burg
[01:35] <Xorifelse> IÄºl try that, thanks
[01:35] <julian-delphiki> I don't believe burg is standard in ubuntu, but i guess ic ould be wrong
[01:35] <IdleOne> julian-delphiki: you aren't
[01:35] <Xorifelse> It is not standard
[01:36] <Xorifelse> But thanks, iÄºl try it in #grub
[01:36] <SaschaP> i already tried to reinstall phonon, but it didn't make anything
[01:37] <SaschaP> and sorry, but "apt-get -install --reinstall gstreamer" would only bring out the error, that there is no "gstreamer" package
[01:38] <julian-delphiki> not -install, just install, and sorry.
[01:38] <julian-delphiki> !find gstreamer
[01:38] <ubottu> Found: bluez-gstreamer, gir1.2-gstreamer-0.10, gstreamer-tools, gstreamer0.10-doc, gstreamer0.10-gconf, gstreamer0.10-gnonlin, gstreamer0.10-gnonlin-dbg, gstreamer0.10-gnonlin-doc, gstreamer0.10-nice, gstreamer0.10-plugins-good (and 107 others) http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=gstreamer&searchon=names&suite=quantal&section=all
[01:38] <SaschaP> yeah, but "gstreamer" is not found ;)
[01:39] <SaschaP> and reinstalling everything would be quite crazy, especially that it make a mistake ( gstreamer0.10-fluendo-plugins-mp3-partner : Kollidiert mit: gstreamer0.10-fluendo-mp3

[01:48] <harris> using play on linux
[01:49] <daftykins> wesam098: your downloaded image could be busted. you tried md5'ing it?
[01:49] <wesam098> daftykins: Whatting it?
[01:50] <somsip> !md5 | wesam098
[01:50] <ubottu> wesam098: To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows

[01:59] <k1l_> !notunity | cub
[01:59] <ubottu> cub: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[01:59] <julian-delphiki> wesam098, you want to md5sum the iso
[02:00] <cub> what do you mean by "investigate gnome tweak tool"?
[02:00] <bfri> can anyone walk me through a fileshare set up

[02:01] <cub> ok
[02:01] <cub> one more question
[02:01] <cub> do i really need to upgrade to 12.04?
[02:01] <julian-delphiki> bfri: what do you mean
[02:01] <skp1> cub: yes or you will die
[02:01] <cub> lol come on
[02:02] <cub> let's be real
[02:02] <k1l_> cub: gnome2 is gone. so you have to find a new way. you can choose the gnome2 lookalike gnome-classic, whihc is a cut-off version. or you try xfce or lxde or other desktops
[02:02] <alcaprawn> cub:
[02:02] <alcaprawn> ;) update
[02:02] <k1l_> cub: support ends for the desktop version end of april. so we recommend it
[02:02] <cub> okay thank you k1l_
[02:03] <cub> so i'm guessing updates will also end then/
[02:03] <k1l_> yep. that is the point. only the server packages get stll updates after april
[02:03] <cub> ic
[02:03] <alcaprawn> what window manager do you guys use gnome?
[02:04] <cub> well i got 3 months to decide..
[02:04] <cub> idk if this pc will be able to support the new gnome... it's old
[02:04] <k1l_> after 12.04 there is no difference betweeen server and desktop anymore. so that gets 5 years support for both
[02:04] <alcaprawn> what you running cub?
[02:04] <k1l_> cub: see xfce or lxde
[02:05] <cub> i'm running this off of an old HP Compaq, 15gb harddrive and like idk 1 gb of ram
[02:05] <wesam098> <julian-delphiki> They're both the same.
[02:06] <k1l_> cub: than you should look out for those i mentioned
[02:06] <daftykins> cub: stay where you are
[02:06] <wesam098> julian-delphiki: Also, they're no such file or directory for /dev/cdrom apparently.
[02:07] <k1l_> daftykins: that is no option in a EOL end of april
[02:07] <daftykins> k1l_: sure, depends if the user cares or not though
[02:08] <k1l_> daftykins: well, that is the users decision but not the ubuntu recommended way. and while we are here we recommend that way :)
[02:08] <daftykins> k1l_: roger that, enjoy thy rather tall horse
[02:08] <k1l_> daftykins: m(
[02:08] <daftykins> :D
[02:09] <daftykins> i meant that at your smugness, carry on
[02:09] <cub> heh
[02:09] <julian-delphiki> wesam098: ok, then your file is fine
[02:09] <k1l_> if you come and support alle the users who get in trouble because you told them so, im fine with that. but i dont think that is gonna happen. so i would like to stick to the common way in this channel

[02:12] <daftykins> plaguedoctor: you need to change the device that sound is being output over
[02:12] <plaguedoctor> daftykins, How do I do that?

[02:13] <daftykins> which ubuntu are you on?

[02:13] <sybariten> hm
[02:13] <compile> Hello all.
[02:13] <compile> I'm trying to install 12.10 using wubi
[02:13] <daftykins> plaguedoctor: hrmm. try searching for 'sound' with the dash
[02:13] <sybariten> i just set up a new ubuntu computer, a laptop. I already have some laptops in the LAN, and i have a server too, with ssh(d)
[02:13] <compile> and from what i see its been on "Copying installation logs..." for about 5 mins now.
[02:13] <plaguedoctor> daftykins, What do you mean?
[02:13] <compile> does this process take a while?
[02:14] <sybariten> i can always connect to that server, but now when doing "ssh 192.168.1.67:38" from the new ubuntu laptop, i get "name or service not known"
[02:14] <daftykins> plaguedoctor: nm, click on the sound icon top right, then settings
[02:15] <sybariten> I can ping that machine though, with the same IP... any ideas?
[02:15] <plaguedoctor> daftykins, I already did that
[02:15] <daftykins> plaguedoctor: and you set output to the HDMI device?
[02:15] <plaguedoctor> daftykins, Yes
[02:15] <sybariten> uh , what i meant with "i can always..." was "normally i have no problems whatsoever to connect to that machine, from my other laptops"
[02:15] <munderwo-work> Hi All. I've got a bare server running ubuntu 12.04, and on startup its got a load of close 8. Using htop it shows high cpu load from kernel threads? Does anybody have some tips to workout what is happening?
[02:16] <munderwo-work> ITs a 4 Core server
[02:16] <Kraln-> munderwo-work: that sounds suspiciously like a storage issue, like rebuilding raid or something
[02:16] <julian-delphiki> munderwo-work: i dont doubt that it has a high load after booting, it should recover quickly.
[02:16] <daftykins> plaguedoctor: and every single related device is definitely unmuted in the mixer? be it called iec... or 5.1 or etc?
[02:16] <plaguedoctor> daftykins, Yes
[02:16] <munderwo-work> Kraln: oohhh I hadnt thought of that. It does have a RAID array in it. Good tip
[02:16] <daftykins> plaguedoctor: ok i give up
[02:17] <plaguedoctor> Anyone here know how to enable audio via HDMI cable?
[02:17] <plaguedoctor> for ubuntu 12.10
[02:18] <wesam098> julian-delphiki: Then whata do..
[02:19] <julian-delphiki> wesam098: i have no idea.
[02:20] <wesam098> julian-delphiki: Well. Do you know why my mouse keeps disconnecting randomly when I use Ubuntu, then? Maybe I can just keep jolicloud.
[02:20] <munderwo-work> Kraln: any idea how to get the status of a dell raid controller on linux?
[02:20] <julian-delphiki> wesam098: i have no deai
[02:20] <julian-delphiki> idea*
[02:20] <SolarisBoy> Kraln-: look into OMSA
[02:21] <wesam098> Actually, joli hasthis html5 back, which makes up the whole OS. It only stops when that's open.
[02:21] <SolarisBoy> better known as Open Manage
[02:21] <wesam098> Oh, alright.
[02:21] <Kraln-> munderwo-work: depends on which management thingy you have
[02:21] <SolarisBoy> grr munderwo-work that is - look into OMSA open manage system administrator - they do pretty well on querying modern dell raid controllers and other environment status
[02:21] <plaguedoctor> HAs anyone got audio to work under HDMI cable attached to a TV for ubuntu 12.10
[02:22] <SolarisBoy> OMSA for dell controllers generally
[02:22] <munderwo-work> SolarisBoy: cheers! i'll have a look at that
[02:22] <sybariten> OK hmmm so i can connect to another, external SSH server
[02:22] <sybariten> but not my own, inside my LAN
[02:22] <sybariten> could there be anything with my server running a too old ubuintu version, that my newly instgalled laptop won't like?
[02:23] <SolarisBoy> munderwo-work: sure
[02:23] <sybariten> Hm... there wasnt
[02:23] <julian-delphiki> sybariten: unlikely.
[02:24] <julian-delphiki> do an ssh -vvvvv when you're connecting

[02:38] <tion_> help?
[02:38] <bigbadben> I have a hard drive I just took apart and I am trying to write data to it so I can see what it looks like when I write to it. It is connected via usb device is there anyway I can tell the usb drive to write data to it
[02:38] <tion_> no the driver is the right one
[02:39] <julian-delphiki> bigbadben you could use DD
[02:39] <bigbadben> whats that
[02:39] <Pbwizkid> can you not mount it and just drag and drop files to it
[02:39] <tion_> i need a driver for the screen?
[02:39] <julian-delphiki> !dd
[02:39] <bigbadben> I can not mount it. I can not see it
[02:39] <julian-delphiki> bigbadben: it doesn't show up at all on your system?
[02:39] <Ben64> tion_: what video card
[02:39] <tion_> why xrandr is such a piece of crap?
[02:39] <julian-delphiki> it's probably broken then
=== squid is now known as Guest4529
[02:40] <julian-delphiki> tion_: what video card
[02:40] <tion_> this isnt about the crad its about the screen
[02:40] <julian-delphiki> tion_: they're related.
[02:40] <Ben64> they're literally connected
[02:40] <julian-delphiki> ^
=== Guest4529 is now known as squid12
[02:40] <tion_> any card can do more that vga
[02:40] <|Anthony|> i use dual monitors and do NOT touch randr
[02:41] <tion_> are we in the 80s?
[02:41] <bigbadben> "JMicron Technology Corp. / JMicron USA Technology Corp. JM20337 Hi-Speed USB to SATA & PATA Combo Bridge " this shows up when I lsusb so It is connected
[02:41] <julian-delphiki> tion_: jesus christ, tell us what card.
[02:41] <Ben64> go away if you aren't going to cooperate
[02:41] <tion_> nvidia driver 173 recomended
[02:41] <julian-delphiki> and you installed the nvidia driver?
[02:41] <|Anthony|> is this a troll
[02:41] <tion_> not yet
[02:41] <julian-delphiki> well then install it
[02:41] <tion_> im using the opendriver
[02:41] <Ben64> tion_: well, which card do you have
[02:42] <tion_> nvidia
[02:42] <Ben64> thats a brand
[02:42] <Ben64> which card do you have
[02:42] <squid12> Does anybody here knows how to choose or prefer a different drivers in Ubuntu?
[02:43] <Ben64> squid12: you can blacklist certain drivers
[02:43] <tion_> i dont know what brand it is might be an asus
[02:43] <Priest_Pio> Hello :)
[02:43] <julian-delphiki> tion_: we need a model
[02:43] <squid12> Hi Ben64....any specific places? like etc... proc?
[02:44] <julian-delphiki> squid12 /etc/modprobe.d/
[02:44] <TheLordOfTime> tion_, can you pastebin the output of lspci?
[02:44] <Ben64> squid12: /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
[02:44] <tion_> the card works fine with 1600x1200
[02:44] <Tecan> in nemo my scripts arnt working
[02:44] <squid12> Thanks Ben64...I will check it out
[02:44] <Ben64> squid12: might be blacklist.conf in there
[02:45] <tion_> one would think xrandr guys would at least support the most used res like vga avga xvga etc etc
[02:45] <squid12> Ben64...yup...I see it. I will now take a look at the man pages
[02:45] <squid12> Ben64....Thank you
[02:45] <Ben64> tion_: you aren't listening, its not about xrandr or the screen or anything
[02:45] <Ben64> tion_: what does this say - "lspci | grep -i vga"
[02:45] <alcaprawn> Ben64: whats he having problems with i cba to scroll up ^.^
[02:45] <tion_> with out ""?
[02:45] <julian-delphiki> tion_: you're really close to people being done helping you.

[02:46] <tion_>  NVIDIA Corporation NV34 [GeForce FX 5200] (rev a1)
[02:46] <Ben64> alcaprawn: resolution stuck at 640x480
[02:46] <munderwo-work> SolarisBoy: SO I have a PERC H310 Raid array. and i've installed OMSA tools but it doesnt seem to be able to connect.
[02:47] <Priest_Pio> I make one clean install using ubuntu 12.10 but after the instalation when the pc start the grub apear in black and don`t show nathing to i acn chose what opearting system i want to use it. Note: I allready make the updates and install nvidia. ANy ideia how to resolve this?
[02:47] <squid12> exit
[02:47] <julian-delphiki> tion_: a little googling tells me that the nvidia driver is what you want
[02:47] <tion_> is it fixed?
[02:47] <SolarisBoy> munderwo-work: make sure your controller firmware is up to date and that all the daemons are loaded up properly
[02:47] <munderwo-work> the OMSA Daemons?
[02:47] <SolarisBoy> munderwo-work: naturally take your time there and follow the docs and backup steps - controller incidents can be pretty nasty
[02:47] <tion_> julian-delphiki: i did that in other distro before upgarding and it didnt wotked
[02:48] <munderwo-work> Luckily this isnt in production yet...
[02:48] <|Anthony|> adobe flash player is constantly crashing. what is the recommended alternative?
[02:48] <tion_> ive upgraded all the way from intrepid
[02:48] <Ben64> tion_: do this - "sudo apt-get install nvidia-current"
[02:48] <SolarisBoy> munderwo-work: yes there are a few and a couple of drivers that get loaded in the process - there should be a wrapper script in the install directory called services.sh that you can use to start/start/status them all
[02:48] <tion_> just toke about 24h
[02:49] <moes> Using startup disk creator in Ubuntu-12.04.1 on a 16 gb flash drive...fat 32 will only allow 4.3 gb persistence file....How can I increase to 8 gb??
[02:49] <tion_> ive instaled them on 9.10 and it didnt worked out the screen res
[02:49] <WXZ> is there anyway to setup ubuntu so that I can switch workspaces independently (monitor 1 = workspace 1, monitor 2 = workspace 2)?
[02:49] <munderwo-work> SolarisBoy: I did an apt-get install, so i'll have a hunt around for the services.sh file
[02:49] <Ben64> moes: you can't with fat32
[02:49] <Priest_Pio> moes try ntfs maby it works
[02:49] <SolarisBoy> munderwo-work: i guess you could updatedb and locate services.sh then
[02:49] <SolarisBoy> if apt-get installs it
[02:50] <tion_> i think its even harder to setup the res after install the nvidia blob
[02:50] <munderwo-work> SolarisBoy: yeah, found it. starting it now
[02:50] <Ben64> tion_: nope
[02:50] <SolarisBoy> munderwo-work: as stated make sure your controller versions are up to date OMSA doesn't like that if it's not
[02:50] <julian-delphiki> tion_: you can't compare 9.10 to 12.x
[02:50] <tion_> how do you know you are using 64B distro
[02:51] <SolarisBoy> along with starting the daemons
[02:51] <munderwo-work> RIghto//
[02:51] <Priest_Pio> Anyone having the same problem here? the grub apears the blank screen and don`t lets chose the operating system?
[02:51] <Ben64> tion_: uname -m
[02:51] <bigbadben> I know it see's the drive I just want to write to it, if I know its bus and device number is there a command to write to it?
[02:52] <tion_> i686
[02:52] <julian-delphiki> tion_: then you are on 32 bit
[02:52] <Ben64> then you're running 32 bit OS
[02:52] <tion_> OMG
[02:52] <julian-delphiki> bigbadben: does it show up in dmesg
[02:52] <Ben64> bigbadben: it needs to show up as /dev/sd_ to be able to write
[02:52] <tion_> this is a computer from 15 years ago
[02:52] <subcool_> k- someone tell me why my drive would be owned by root?
[02:52] <julian-delphiki> tion_: then there is no way that 64 bit will work, likely
[02:52] <subcool_> i have entire hard drive that i store my movies on- that is for some reason. owned by root
[02:52] <WXZ> is there anyway to setup ubuntu so that I can switch workspaces independently (monitor 1 = workspace 1, monitor 2 = workspace 2)?
[02:52] <julian-delphiki> subcool_: because devices are owned by root, by default.
[02:53] <tion_> isnt that news
[02:53] <bigbadben> It does show up in dmesg
[02:53] <kcoffman> Hi, I was wondering if I could get some help with my Compaq Presario V6000 running 12.04 LTS
[02:53] <Ben64> bigbadben: pastebin it?
[02:53] <usr13> subcool_: Is this a special storage drive?
[02:54] <tion_> Ubuntu Description:	Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS Release:	12.04 Codename:	precise
[02:54] <usr13> subcool_: You should be able to just change the ownership with sudo.
[02:54] <jakepiano> hi i have ubuntu installed. i want to dual boot ubuntu and windows 8. is there an easy way to do that?
[02:54] <tion_> what do i do after i install the nvidia blob?
[02:54] <BlackDalek> is there any simple way to remove customized colour themes from unity? My wife's PC was using Ubuntu 11.04 with customized colour gnome theme and when she upgraded to 12.04, it took the custom colour setting with it and now all the top menus are unreadable (black on black) and icon text is all black on black... how do we remove custom colours in unity and get the default colour theme back?
[02:55] <bigbadben> http://pastebin.com/XtRkSsYz
[02:55] <bigbadben> its the jmicron usb to atabridge
[02:55] <usr13> subcool_: But how did you do this?  What did you do?   How did you copy the files to it?
[02:55] <tion_> cant anyone help?
[02:55] <subcool_> julian-delphiki, usr13 - um it is a harddrive set to initiate during boot- but i have never run into this issue. chown 777 right?
[02:56] <subcool_> thats my point- i have never had an issue until today
[02:56] <daftykins> bigbadben: "sudo fdisk -l" does it show up?
[02:56] <psychopathic> BlackDalek: Just erase the config files in the home directory.
[02:56] <usr13> subcool_: Well, no.  You'd want to change ownership.  Right?
[02:56] <munderwo-work> SolarisBoy: Ok, so had a look at the storage stuff and physical and virtual disks are all a-ok.. So I still have a whole bunch of kernel threads consuming a LOT of lod
[02:56] <tion_> i bet TF2 can setup better res that xrandr
[02:56] <munderwo-work> *load
[02:56] <julian-delphiki> bigbadben: looks like its sde?
[02:57] <subcool_> yeah
[02:57] <usr13> sburjan`: What is the mount point?
[02:57] <BlackDalek> psychopathic... I don't know where to find them... :( any clues?
[02:57] <subcool_> usr13, yeah
[02:57] <Ben64> tion_: after you get the nvidia driver, reboot
[02:57] <usr13> subcool_: What is the mount point?
[02:57] <munderwo-work> Kraln-: WEll looks like my raid arrays check out.
[02:57] <julian-delphiki> bigbadben, if it is infact /dev/sde you could "dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sde"
[02:57] <tion_> its not gona work!
[02:57] <subcool_> usr13, i dont remember.. :/
[02:57] <julian-delphiki> tion_: you're not very willing to try things
[02:57] <bigbadben> I have another external hardrive hooked up
[02:58] <usr13> subcool_: YOu don't know the mount point?  How do you know it's owned by root?
[02:58] <tion_> well at least it leted me use extended destop res
[02:58] <TheLordOfTime> tion_, if you're not willing to try things that we're suggesting, which would likely help fix your issue, nobody'll want to help you
[02:58] <subcool_> i pulled up a few files and look at their properties
[02:58] <julian-delphiki> bigbadben: hmm, may want to unplug everything except this one drive
[02:58] <julian-delphiki> to be sure.
[02:58] <usr13> subcool_: What is the user name that you use on this PC?
[02:58] <tion_> i cant click the box on the nvidia drivers install screen
[02:58] <psychopathic> BlackDalek: The config files are listed with a .* in front of them with "ls -a" or show hidden files in nautilus.
[02:58] <subcool_> subcool
[02:58] <bigbadben> yeah Ill try it on my laptob maybe
[02:58] <tion_> its below the visible screen
[02:58] <subcool_> usr13,
[02:59] <julian-delphiki> bigbadben: laptop*
[02:59] <tion_> this monitor dont know what a EIDI is!
[02:59] <usr13> subcool_: ls -l /where-ever/it/is  |pastebinit
[03:00] <Ben64> tion_: what install screen? you should have done it through apt-get
[03:00] <kcoffman> I have a problem with the sound and volume control on my laptop. If the sound is below about 80% it's silent, when it's at 100% it's super loud and there is a very small window for a happy medium
[03:01] <tion_> sudo apt-get install nvidia-current what driver is it going to fetch?
[03:01] <usr13> subcool_: sudo chown subcool /where-ever/it/is
[03:01] <BlackDalek> psychopathic we guessed it would be one of the hidden files, but which? None of them in the home directory are screaming out "I have theme customizations in here"... :(
[03:01] <julian-delphiki> tion_: whatever the current nvidia driver is...
[03:02] <tion_> i cant use the latest
[03:02] <tion_> wtf i need 173
[03:02] <julian-delphiki> tion_: i think people here about ready to be done helping you.
[03:02] <usr13> subcool_: But make sure you do it to the correct directory.
[03:03] <tion_> you dont help you just telling me to push buttons
[03:03] <subcool_> usr13, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529806/
[03:03] <tion_> i just know its not gona work
[03:03] <julian-delphiki> tion_: well, we're trying to help, and you're being very argumenative to people who are trying to help
[03:03] <tion_> and probablly x wont starrt
[03:03] <tion_> i tryed it before
[03:03] <julian-delphiki> tried*
[03:03] <Ben64> tion_: then go away
[03:04] <usr13> subcool_: What comand gave you that output,  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529806/ ?

[03:06] <bigbadben> That did not work I wonder why
[03:06] <Ben64> tion_: if you won't listen, leave

[03:07] <the_hydra> hi all
[03:07] <Ben64> tion_: this is the last time i'm going to tell you. xrandr is not the issue, you need the driver

[03:15] <subcool_> usr13, yeah i can read them
[03:15] <subcool_> ive always had write permission. this is weird.
[03:15] <subcool_> thats my movie directory.
[03:15] <usr13> subcool_: Is it auto mounting them in that way?

[03:18] <subcool_> usr13, i know- im trying to delete things
[03:18] <subcool_> usr13, that when i found out its root
[03:19] <usr13> subcool_: Use sudo
[03:19] <subcool_> yeah.... but i still need to be able to write to it.
[03:19] <jakepiano> uhm i think. heres a link to what it looks like. http://imgur.com/OdJ9E
[03:20] <the_hydra> subcool, is it possible that it is mounted as "read only"?
[03:20] <the_hydra> subcool, try to check mount command output
[03:20] <jakepiano> artful_d
[03:20] <the_hydra> subcool, if you see "ro", then it's read only
[03:20] <subcool_> the_hydra, uh- ... lol... got me..
[03:20] <the_hydra> subcool, pardon?
[03:21] <usr13> the_hydra: It's mounted rw  see: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529825/
[03:21] <the_hydra> usr13, alright :)
[03:21] <usr13> the_hydra: It's 19% full  see: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529845/
[03:22] <Ben64> subcool_: what groups do you belong to? (type "groups" in terminal)
[03:22] <usr13> the_hydra: But it's also exFAT filesystem.  See:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529816/
[03:22] <subcool_> Ben64, idk
[03:22] <subcool_> my head hurts
[03:22] <subcool_> i need a drink
[03:22] <usr13> the_hydra: *91%
[03:23] <the_hydra> usr13, hm, exFAT......
[03:23] <Ben64> its ntfs
[03:23] <the_hydra> usr13, not sure how much exFAT/NTFS reserve, but AFAIK it should be around 5%, same like ext2/3/4
[03:23] <usr13> Ben64: the_hydra It says:  HPFS/NTFS/exFAT
[03:24] <artful_d> jakepiano: cool, so you need to shrink sda1 by... whatever you want Win8 to be... 100GB or whatever
[03:24] <corvaxia> I have a hopefully stupid question. I have .cbr on my linux desktop that I would like to share with my android tablet directly and skip using dropbox. What is the best option available?
[03:24] <the_hydra> usr13, or maybe, just maybe, it already drains its inodes numbers
[03:25] <jakepiano> ok and then what? i'm afraid i'll get the same error from trying to install win8. do i have to change it to primary or something?
[03:25] <artful_d> jakepiano: obviously, you've got this going on another PC so just say what's going on and we can walk you through it.
[03:25] <usr13> subcool_: At any rate, you should be able to delete some files.  Just do ls ls -ltrS    <will list by file sizes, largest last> and pick a particularly big one and delete it.
[03:25] <subcool_> usr13, i know what i wanna delete - thats no problem
[03:26] <subcool_> but, i also want to put file IN there..
[03:26] <subcool_> i really dont get why it is mounted as root
[03:26] <usr13> subcool_: ls -ltrS /media/StorageX2/MoviesX2/
[03:26] <Ben64> subcool_: give list of groups
[03:26] <subcool_> how
[03:26] <tion_> wow it worked :P
[03:26] <Ben64> i told you how in the same line i asked for it
[03:26] <Ben64> subcool_: what groups do you belong to? (type "groups" in terminal)
[03:26] <subcool_> subcool adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
[03:27] <usr13> subcool_: ls -ltrS /media/StorageX2/MoviesX2/ |pastebinit
[03:27] <jakepiano> i've got to go but i'll be back in a half hour or so. can i get your email to let you know when i'm back?
[03:27] <Ben64> well then i don't know. we have the same groups, same mount options, but i can copy things to my ntfs drive
[03:27] <artful_d> jakepiano: on your current configuration, sda1 and sda2 are primary. You get 4. So Win 8 needs
[03:27] <kcoffman> Can someone help me with a 12.04 sound issue
[03:27] <WXZ> is there anyway to setup ubuntu so that I can switch workspaces independently (monitor 1 = workspace 1, monitor 2 = workspace 2)?

[03:33] <usr13> the_hydra: No, sorry, don't know about touchegg either.
[03:34] <the_hydra> usr13, ok np
[03:34] <tion_> should i install the recomended driver now? that is 173.?
[03:34] <the_hydra> basically my problem is, how to find out if my touchpad does indeed support multitouch

[03:35] <Guest21135> my computer freezes with an ubuntu 12.04 usb pen drive inserted. it cant even enter bios. what s wrong?
[03:35] <Nukien> Can anyone point me in the right direction for building an install udeb/something that can query the user for information, much as the tasksel one does during regular install?

[03:37] <brian_petersen> I have a dual boot with windows 8. How do I set the default Grub selection for windows? I don't want to edit the menu file as that would be overwritten everytime I do update-grub. Any ideas?

[03:38] <scarrs> well I got mpd, mpc, gmpc and ampache working. would anybody like to know how I did it?
[03:38] <altin> is there a good linux app for designing graphs ?
[03:38] <the_hydra> Guest21135, i think it's more like hardware problem, either your usb port or the usb pendrive itself
[03:38] <the_hydra> brian_petersen, IIRC it
[03:39] <the_hydra> brian_petersen, it's in /etc/sysconfig/grub IIRC
[03:39] <the_hydra> alta, like Visio?

[03:41] <the_hydra> brian_petersen, you welcome
[03:42] <Guest21135> the_hydra , i also believe it s a motherboard issue although im almost sure that making some modification in ubuntu install the computer could not freeze and let me use a boot loader
[03:42] <altin> the_hydra: is that in ubuntu repo ?

[03:43] <Guest21135> the_hydra , i dont know anything about boot loader syslinux etc
[03:43] <the_hydra> Guest21135, when exactly it got freeze? right after RAM counts?
[03:44] <kcoffman> I am having a problem with my sound levels. If it's below about 80% (on the slider bar) it's totally silent, when it's at 100% it's super loud.
[03:44] <Guest21135> the_hydra , it freezes after checking hd s cdrom
[03:45] <altin> the_hydra: kk will take a look at them :)
[03:45] <altin> thnx
[03:45] <the_hydra> Guest21135, totally trivial idea, can you switch that into usb legacy mode
[03:46] <Guest21135> the_hydra , i ve tryed that with no success
[03:46] <the_hydra> kcoffman, have you check with alsamixer command?
[03:46] <sqldad> I can't find libdvdcss2 -- am I missing something in my sources.list?
[03:46] <kcoffman> I have no idea what I am doing. :/
[03:46] <sqldad> nm, found the answer
[03:47] <the_hydra> kcoffman, open terminal and type "alsamixer"
[03:47] <kcoffman> okay. now what
[03:47] <the_hydra> kcoffman, my guess, either Master or PCM level is too high
[03:47] <the_hydra> kcoffman, see those bars?
[03:48] <kcoffman> Master and PCM are both at 100 from what I can tell
[03:48] <the_hydra> kcoffman, then lower them, imho the ideal level are both around 70%
[03:48] <kcoffman> yes, I see them
[03:48] <the_hydra> kcoffman, but feel free to experiment
[03:48] <kcoffman> the_hydra how do I lower them?
[03:49] <the_hydra> kcoffman, use down arrow to lower, up arrow to raise
=== geudrik is now known as geudrik|AFK
[03:49] <the_hydra> kcoffman, use left or right arrow to choose which one you wanna modify
[03:49] <kcoffman> the_hydra, do you want me to lower PCM and Master to ~70
[03:49] <the_hydra> when you are done, just press Escape, sometimes you need to press it twice
[03:50] <Nukien> Can anyone point me in the right direction for building an install udeb/something that can query the user for information, much as the tasksel one does during regular install?

[03:52] <tion_> can someone help?
[03:52] <julian-delphiki> tion_: that card is probably too old for 3d
[03:52] <dcherniv> Nukien, !dialog
[03:52] <tion_> it worked fine in intrepid
[03:52] <Nukien> Maybe I'm not being clear: Boot the install ISO, and it starts asking questions - hostname, main username/password, the tasksel section where you choose what type of system it is.

[03:54] <Nukien> hah - just figured that. thought it was a bot query
[03:55] <Nukien> thanks
[03:55] <tion_> can i try installing the 173. nvidia driver?
[03:55] <the_hydra> kcoffman, still too loud?
[03:55] <tion_> or is going back to poor resolution?
[03:55] <the_hydra> kcoffman, sorry, can't browse pic right now, i am reserving bandwith to download ISO
[03:56] <julian-delphiki> tion_ I'm unsure.
[03:56] <kcoffman> the_hydra no, it's super quiet now at 100%
[03:56] <the_hydra> kcoffman, what????? weird
[03:56] <tion_> i need to install steam
[03:56] <dcherniv> tion_, glxgears will vsync so the fps wont be higher than your vfreq in this case 60hz
[03:57] <Nukien> Is dialog workable from a preseed environment right after ISO boot? For example in the d-i preseed/early_command string ?
[03:57] <kcoffman> the_hydra I took a screen shot to show you the terminal and the volume level on my computer so maybe you'd understand it better... i have no idea

[03:57] <tion_> how can i remove openoffice?
[03:58] <tion_> apt-get remove openoffice* ?
[03:58] <julian-delphiki> tion_: remove it in the package manager
[03:58] <tion_> but all at once
[03:58] <dcherniv> Nukien, what you're doing is non-standard so you're kind of on your own. I dont see why it wouldnt as long as there's a hook in the installer process to stick a script in
[03:58] <Nukien> I'm poking around at the syslinux cmenu setup as well, to use checkboxes before the kernel is even booted. That looks workable, but no nice background image like vesamenu.c32 can do.
[03:58] <tion_> not 1 app at a time
[03:58] <julian-delphiki> tion_: then your solution will likely work
[03:59] <Nukien> The d-i preseed/early_command string is exactly that, but I haven't found if there's any facility for communicating with the user during install
[03:59] <kcoffman> the_hydra hang on, I stopped the upload once I saw what you said about reserving bandwith
[03:59] <Nukien> Looking to be able to provide information that regular preseeding can't handle, to build a completely hands-off install.

[04:03] <julian-delphiki> tion_: that would be specific of the client you're using
[04:04] <julian-delphiki> Guest46286: sudo su -
[04:04] <julian-delphiki> will make you root
[04:04] <magn3ts> Why is there not an OpenJDK 7u11 update yet?
[04:04] <kcoffman> the_hydra I can't get a snapshot with the volume bar showing
[04:04] <julian-delphiki> magn3ts: you can install the update from oracle
[04:04] <dcherniv> Guest46286, sudo su - is not recommended use sudo -i
[04:04] <julian-delphiki> dcherniv, why is sudo su - not correct?
[04:04] <the_hydra> julian-delphiki, Guest43354 : or sudo -s
[04:05] <julian-delphiki> sudo su - works just as well as sudo -i
[04:05] <dcherniv> julian-delphiki, beats me, ubuntu guide says sudo su is a no no
[04:05] <the_hydra> kcoffman, hmmmm
[04:05] <magn3ts> julian-delphiki: that's the sun, er, oracle jdk.
[04:05] <julian-delphiki> To start a root shell (i.e. a command window where you can run Root commands), starting Root's environment and login scripts, use:
[04:05] <julian-delphiki> sudo -i     (similar to sudo su - , gives you roots environment configuration)
[04:05] <magn3ts> julian-delphiki: (also, the PPA with the oracle jdk installer isn't updated either, oops)
[04:06] <magn3ts> I did see that Oracle did a linux targz release though.
[04:06] <Guest46286> thankx
[04:06] <julian-delphiki> magn3ts: ppa's are maintained by the community
[04:06] <julian-delphiki> dcherniv, all it says is that its similar to sudo -s
[04:07] <kcoffman> but when I mess with the PCM and master volumes they change my bar but it's like if you bar represents 100% of sound from 0(being silent) to 100(being loudest) at 80% is when you can hear sound, if it's anything less than 80%, it's totally silent from 79% to 0%; at 100% it's really like 120% and I am afraid it will blow my speakers. They worked fine until 12.04
[04:07] <julian-delphiki> and that it doesn't get root's path... which I don't think is correct
[04:08] <the_hydra> kcoffman, hm, it's beyond my knowledge, but I can only suggest to play with the bar..... maybe you need both pcm and master level at 80%
[04:08] <the_hydra> kcoffman, or maybe 90%
[04:09] <tion_> soft center crashed
[04:09] <kcoffman> the_hyrda okay, I still have a few problems. 1 being Tor and 2 being the volume control above my keyboard
[04:09] <jakepiano> artful_n are you here still?
[04:10] <jakepiano> artful_d are you here?
[04:10] <kcoffman> the_hyrda do you have a "desktop" viewing software enabled? I can try to show you that way?
[04:10] <julian-delphiki> jakepiano, there is no name like that
[04:10] <tion_> how do i change icons order on the lunch bar?
[04:11] <magn3ts> I recommend tails instead of trying to run Tor securely yourself. Unless you *really* know what you're doing.
[04:11] <linux> random question, anyone in here tried JessBuntu ?
[04:11] <tion_> how do i change icons order on the lunch bar?
[04:11] <julian-delphiki> linux: this is ubuntu support
[04:11] <julian-delphiki> so
[04:11] <tion_> i want work areas 1st
[04:12] <magn3ts> linux: that is hideous looking, and no.
[04:12] <magn3ts> It looks like a custom icon theme + awn theme... not sure why everyone rolls a distro for a custom theme
[04:12] <kcoffman> magn3ts have no idea what I am doing
[04:13] <tion_> should i run nvidia xconfig as root?
[04:13] <magn3ts> kcoffman: I recommend tails then. It's an ISO you can burn and boot or run less securely in a VM. It has good defaults, etc, to keep from leaking your identity, which often happens when people run  Tor under Ubuntu without taking all the precautions.
[04:13] <jakepiano> yeah i was talking to him earlier.
[04:13] <magn3ts> tion_: it will error and fail if you don't wanyway.
[04:13] <jakepiano> could someone help me with partitions for installing win8? i have ubuntu currently
[04:14] <munderwo-work> Hi all. Any idea why my server would be having a load average of 7-8 on a 4 core machine when nothing is running. It looks like Kernel threads according to htop. Is there anyway of finding out which processes are contributing to load average?
[04:14] <tion_> nvidia current instaled the worng driver
[04:14] <ai23k> hi all, I have an ubuntu installation ubuntu 10.10(which we have planned to upgrade to latest one soon) but I am facing a problem to install packages as repos are no more working how can i install packages to my machine now
[04:14] <kcoffman> magn3ts can I run it from a USB drive?
[04:14] <magn3ts> tion_: can you elaborate?
[04:14] <tion_> how do i setup xvga+ res?
[04:14] <julian-delphiki> ai23k: what error are you getting
[04:14] <magn3ts> kcoffman: sure, you can dd the iso to a jump drive and boot from that. I doubt it has an EFI partition on it, so be wary of that if you have a late 2012/2013 new computer.
[04:14] <Guest46286> where does system file reside in lubuntu(/etc,/home,/var etc.)
[04:15] <magn3ts> tion_: Why do you think nvidia-current installed the wrong driver?
[04:15] <julian-delphiki> Guest46286: "system file" ?
[04:15] <tion_> some one told me to do it because i had vga res and now in 1024x

[04:15] <julian-delphiki> ai23k, you're using a mirror that doesn't work, probably.
[04:15] <ai23k> julian-delphiki: are there any working repos for 10.10
[04:16] <tion_> because on the additional driver applet recomends 173.
[04:16] <magn3ts> ai23k: did you manually set that mirror? You'll probably need to change it and remove the us-east-1... prefix.
[04:16] <Guest46286> file like,bin,boot,dev,lib,root,proc etc..
[04:16] <WXZ> is there anyway to setup ubuntu so that I can switch workspaces independently (monitor 1 = workspace 1, monitor 2 = workspace 2)?
[04:17] <julian-delphiki> ai23k: read the 2nd post? http://cloud.ubuntu.com/tag/ec2/
[04:17] <ai23k> magn3ts: actually I am using an amazon instance they have setup their own mirrors to save their bandwidth
[04:17] <jakepiano> could someone help me with partitions for installing win8? i have ubuntu currently
[04:17] <ai23k> but if there is anyone working definately i will use that
[04:17] <magn3ts> ai23k: then it's an issue with amazon, they seem to have misconfigured something... probably because 10.10 is really old.
[04:17] <Chaosadnd> Anyone good at apache2 that could help me out for a few minutes?
[04:17] <magn3ts> Is this an ancient VM or what?
[04:17] <magn3ts> Do they still support 10.10?
[04:17] <julian-delphiki> magn3ts: no its just on Ec2
[04:18] <julian-delphiki> magn3ts: there are lots of people on 10.04 still
[04:18] <julian-delphiki> server LTS
[04:18] <magn3ts> Right, I'm just trying to figure out if he has a new image of 10.10 and amazon is provisioning new instances with bad mirrors... or if this is an instance that has managed to live this long and references servers they deprecated.
[04:19] <magn3ts> Either way, it's an issue with Amazon for pointing apt at a broken mirror or breaking their mirror later. You can remove the prefix and use the ubuntu archives if you want to fix it in the iterim.
[04:19] <tion_> magn3ts: how do i setup arbitrary res? like 1152 x 864
[04:20] <magn3ts> tion_: If you have a GTX card, and X is using the nvidia driver, I would use nvidia-settings. (this is what I use on my desktop)
[04:20] <tion_> im using the max avaiable that is 1024 x	768
[04:20] <anunnaki> so any old timers in here?

[04:21] <julian-delphiki> anunakki: what do you mean?
[04:21] <anunnaki> there was this dude from africa that had his own networkig business.. hung out in here forgot his name
[04:22] <stuck109> my computers usb ports aren't working, think I need to reinstall drivers? How can I do this?
[04:22] <anunnaki> i think south africa...  weird first name .. said tons of pot grew around his house.. anyone know him? lol
[04:23] <magn3ts> tion_: 173.1436 *is* the recommended driver.
[04:23] <magn3ts> Are you SURE X is currently using it?
[04:23] <WXZ> is there anyway to setup ubuntu so that I can switch workspaces independently (monitor 1 = workspace 1, monitor 2 = workspace 2)?
[04:24] <tion_> x is using 2xx driver
[04:24] <tion_> but ont
[04:24] <tion_> not
[04:24] <magn3ts> WXZ: doubtful, the "workspace" is really both displays together, there isn't really a way to address them as "the left side of W1" and "the right side of W1"
[04:24] <tion_> i instaled nvidia driver before but got stuck with very low res options
[04:24] <jakepiano> could someone help me with partitions for installing win8? i have ubuntu currently
[04:25] <magn3ts> tion_: I can't tell what you mean. It *is* or *isn't* ?
[04:25] <WXZ> magn3ts: I wasn't really looking for a left and right side, I want the full workspace on one monitor, and another full workspace on the other
[04:25] <magn3ts> You have three options: VESA, Nvidia, or Nouveau.
[04:25] <WXZ> magn3ts: sort of like in awesome, but awesome has a huge learning curve
[04:25] <tion_> jokey crashed
[04:26] <magn3ts> WXZ: well same difference, that would be the "model" needed to do the sort of workspace-monitor-independent thing you want, but no, that's not how it works in gnome/kde/xfce that I'm familiar with.
[04:26] <magn3ts> I need to learn awesome :/

[04:28] <Redeeemed> hi
[04:29] <jakepiano> could someone help me with partitions for installing win8? i have ubuntu currently
[04:30] <_helios_> jakepiano, win8 is the worste OS made, crashes constantly
[04:30] <matrixfox> id10t errors
[04:31] <jakepiano> yup but i need it for school. i want to dual boot ubuntu and win8 but i have to install win8 first before i do. so help please someone?
[04:31] <_helios_> Why would you need win8 for school im just curious
[04:31] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Sounds like you have the right idea. What do you need help wtih?
[04:31] <clone1018> How can I change my open file limits on ubuntu 12.10?
[04:32] <jakepiano> i need to partition my drive in a way that windows likes. i know it needs to be primary and to be a large partition. i'm not sure if it needs to be ntfs. if so how do i do all of that?
[04:32] <jakepiano> martixfox i need to partition my drive in a way that windows likes. i know it needs to be primary and to be a large partition. i'm not sure if it needs to be ntfs. if so how do i do all of that?
[04:33] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Just install Windows 8, then restart and isntall Ubuntu.
[04:33] <Redeeemed> I am downloading the windows installer
[04:33] <matrixfox> Ubuntu has a built in function that will install it side-by-side with Windows.
[04:33] <Redeeemed> Windows is a monsteriousity
[04:33] <_helios_> jakepiano, Windows 8 is going to fight with you unless you make it the primary OS.
[04:33] <Redeeemed> anything is better than it I am sure
[04:33] <jakepiano> i tried installing it already and it didn't work. it told me it wasn't partitioned correctly.
[04:33] <Redeeemed> and my friends sware by ubuntu
[04:34] <munderwo-work> OK, so the Very high cpu load was caused by the acpi_pad kernel module. Is there any danger in turning this off
[04:34] <_helios_> Redeeemed, you should do a full install or a dual boot, the windows installer wont give you the real experience of ubuntu it will be allot slower than a full install.
[04:34] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Did you try setup your own Linux partitions?
[04:35] <Redeeemed> I am doing dual boot
[04:35] <Redeeemed> I gave it 100GB
[04:35] <_helios_> But if you do it with the Windows Installer it won't be the real deal.
[04:35] <Redeeemed> I don't have any discs to burn at the moment
[04:35] <jakepiano> i'm not sure. i dont know how to do much of this. i'll show you what i have right now. http://imgur.com/OdJ9E
[04:35] <_helios_> Can you boot from USB?
[04:36] <Redeeemed> I dont have any media of any kind at the moment
[04:36] <Redeeemed> otherwise believe me I will
[04:36] <Redeeemed> I will not hold windows performance issues against ubuntu
[04:36] <Redeeemed> I just want to see if the interface agrees with me
[04:36] <Redeeemed> if it does
[04:36] <_helios_> Redeeemed, well as soon as you can you want to switch to a full install.
[04:36] <Redeeemed> then I will get a DVD and oa  a real install
[04:38] <ai23k> magn3ts: I think ubuntu has discontinued support for 10.10 that is the problem
[04:38] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Looks like a mess. Should install Windows first, before Ubuntu...

[04:39] <vrtigo_indx> hey all, I'm having some issues with wifi on 12.04, anyone happen to know of a fix?
[04:39] <Redeeemed> I have heard Linux doesn't get viruses as much as Windows is that true?
[04:39] <unreal82> Rose garden or ardour?
[04:41] <unreal82> Redeeeded: yes
[04:41] <unreal82> Redeeemed*
[04:41] <matrixfox> Redeeemed: Lie
[04:41] <ChaozHenchman> yeah, one because more people use windows and two you can't access the root directory in linux
[04:42] <_helios_> Redeeemed, you can still get a virus if you trust some script kiddie who makes a script that gives him remote access to your computer and he talks you into running his script as root
[04:43] <matrixfox> or install weird software you don't fully trust, or land on sites with exploits
[04:43] <_helios_> Redeeemed, but the chances of a regular virus like you get just surfing the web in windows is highly unlikely.
[04:43] <jakepiano> matrixfox yeah thats what i'm trying to do. how does the hard drive need to be partitioned for windows to be installed? once i get into windows i can get it all worked out. i just need windows first
[04:43] <matrixfox> jakepiano: You should move the boot off of the main drive btw~
[04:44] <_helios_> jakepiano, usualy windows has a 250mb SYSTEM partition then it has the C partition.
[04:44] <jakepiano> matrix fox _helios_  how do i do that?
[04:45] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Windows 8 uses two partitons. Boot and a main Local Disk
[04:45] <_helios_> jakepiano, I couldn't explain it step by step but I'm sure you could use the application gparted to help you out.

=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[04:45] <jakepiano> yeah i have gparted and matrixfox i know that. how do i partition it correctly so?
[04:46] <_helios_> jakepiano, the problem is windows doesn't give you the option of where to install it.
[04:46] <_helios_> jakepiano, windows wants your whole system it doesn't like sharing
[04:46] <matrixfox> jakepiano: I would make the boot partion 350MB's, and the Local Disk the rest of the hard drive.
[04:46] <jakepiano> ok how do i do that?
[04:47] <agent> I'm having a problem with my wireless. I've found lots of suggestions on the forum but, none are working. I didn't have the problem until I upgraded to 12.04.
[04:47] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Both NTFS, bah
[04:47] <_helios_> jakepiano, why don't you just keep the full install of ubuntu and run windows as a virtual box?
[04:49] <agent> There are lots of suggestions about dual boot as windows but, I'm not using windows.
[04:49] <jakepiano> ooh thats a good idea  _helios_ . what would be the advantage/disadvantage of having it swapped? i was going to do ubuntu as a virtual box
[04:49] <agent> wireless is on in bios but I can't get it to turn on in ubuntu
[04:50] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Running VM's have a lot of down sides
[04:50] <agent> so I was wondering where to access ubuntu related questions
[04:50] <jakepiano> like what?
[04:50] <unreal82> matrixfox: agreed.
[04:50] <_helios_> well windows 8 constantly crashes my gf has it on her laptop and she can't stand it so I'm prob going to have to change her to windows 7 because she don't understand ubuntu.
[04:50] <matrixfox> jakepiano: Well for one, networking...
[04:50] <thec4ke> like i hope you dont enjoy 3d games
[04:51] <_helios_> jakepiano, I would run Ubuntu as the main and Windows 8 as the virtual box.
[04:51] <agent> best. As she might not be able to find info on ubuntu in the ubuntu sections, only windows
[04:51] <jakepiano> well i'm a college student. i dont need a whole lot of networking stuff games, etc. i just need it for word processing and such
[04:51] <thec4ke> then ubuntu is fine
[04:51] <_helios_> jakepiano, ubuntu has tons of word processing and its free.
[04:51] <thec4ke> you shouldnt even need windows as a vm

[04:52] <jakepiano> well either way i'd like windows around for some things as i'm learning ubuntu. how do i do a virtural box?
[04:52] <_helios_> jakepiano, and you can save your files in .docx format for the windows teachers,  I'm going to college to and I told them I don't do the Windows thing so I send my assignments as a .pdf or .docx becaues LIbreOffice can create microsoft .docx formatted files.
[04:52] <agent> Now, if your sister were to eliminate windows and only had ubuntu on her machine... if she had a problem with wireless connecting, where should she look?
[04:53] <jakepiano> ok great i'll use that! either way how do i go about getting win8 on a virtual box?

[04:53] <agent> how about asking in a windows 8 chat?

[04:54] <_helios_> jakepiano, I'm not sure what the best VM client is these days but they all should work,  If you google it you're sure to find tons of info.
[04:54] <d3remark> i did a 12.04 netboot install and installed the MATE desktop on my own
[04:54] <jakepiano> alright
[04:54] <agent> same d3remark

[05:30] <kcoffman> How do I burn an ISO to a jump drive (tails)
[05:30] <jhansonxi_> WXZ: You can sort-of do that if you configure X.org for non-Xinerama or "Zaphod" mode where each monitor has it's own X session.  But you can't drag a window from one to the other.  Many desktop environments don't support it correctly either.  Xfce is the best with Ubuntu 12.04.
[05:31] <WXZ> jhansonxi_: I have zaphod mode right now, but I really need to move windows across, it doesn't have to be a drag thing, I can do it in commandline, but windows have to move.
[05:32] <jhansonxi_> WXZ: With this mode you configure the desktop on each monitor independently with their own menus, panels, and workspaces.
[05:34] <crazycory22> and i lost my mouse...
[05:34] <jhansonxi_> WXZ:  It's not possible to drag a window from one desktop to the other with Zaphod mode.  They are independent.  Some desktop environments can drag text between apps on each, and some file managers may be able to support drag-n-drop of files, but nothing else.

[06:12] <jhansonxi> akis: One may have outdated package lists or it may be using a different repository mirror that doesn't have the latest package yet.
[06:13] <xsumi5> Anyone know of any odd issues plugging in headphones with a mic / vol controls on it?

[06:15] <jaker44444> usr13 it says no crontab
[06:16] <magn3ts_> I'd rather poke my eyes out than use a 1600x1200 display over VGA

[06:16] <dr_willis> unreal82:  you an dd the /dev/whatever device to a image if you wanted
[06:16] <magn3ts_> tion, you'll have to get a manual for the monitor and set a modeset line yourself probably.
=== SouravAj is now known as Sail
[06:17] <dr_willis> unreal82:  that may not work with some copy protected disks
[06:17] <jaker44444> no crontab for root - using an empty one  Select an editor.  To change later, run 'select-editor'.   1. /bin/ed   2. /bin/nano        <---- easiest   3. /usr/bin/vim.tiny
[06:17] <usr13> jaker44444:  crontab -e
[06:17] <magn3ts_> again, depends on hte Xorg conf, several people have asked you to help us help you.
[06:17] <tion> how do i set a modeset line?
[06:17] <usr13> jaker44444: Oh, well take your pick.  nano?
[06:17] <magn3ts_> usr13 gave you instructions above to start helping.
[06:17] <jhansonxi> akis:  Open a terminal window and try on the affected system: sudo apt-get update
[06:17] <magn3ts_> tion, usr13 asked you to do this, it will help us: #  pastebinit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[06:17] <tion> this monitor can handle any rest up to 1600x1200
[06:18] <tion> i already did

[06:18] <tion> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1530103/
[06:18] <magn3ts_> tion, and I assume you've rebooted so that you're sure the nvidia driver is currently active?
[06:19] <tion> didnt you read the xorg.conf on paste bin?
[06:19] <magn3ts_> tion, that doesn't mean it's in use.
[06:19] <jhansonxi> tion: Try a modeline calculator like: http://arachnoid.com/modelines/index.html
[06:19] <magn3ts_> tion, make cfg change -> reboot -> cfg is active. I don't know if you've done the second and third part.
[06:19] <tion> 1209 frames in 5.0 seconds = 241.799 FPS

[06:20] <magn3ts_> tion, what do you mean "configuration disabled"?
[06:21] <magn3ts_> did it give you an error message/window?
[06:21] <jhansonxi> akis: The affected system simply had an outdated version of the package lists from the repository.  Normally the update applet will updated them periodically but it may have had trouble accessing the mirror when it tried.

[06:22] <Ben64> jaker44444: i mean the /wine/windows/tmp
[06:22] <tion> on the layout config page
[06:22] <Ben64> jaker44444: thats probably not the right directory
[06:22] <magn3ts_> tion, do you have two monitors? It can't have the display as "disabled" if you're currently looking at it...
[06:23] <jhansonxi> akis: The "apt-get update" just tells it to fetch a new set of lists from all repositories.  All the package management tools (Synaptic, Aptitude, Ubuntu Software Center) use the same system.
[06:23] <tion> 1 monitor
[06:23] <Ben64> tion: stop arguing and post a screenshot, don't know why you have to argue every single thing, not a very efficient way to get help

[06:24] <android> hi
[06:24] <android> how do i change my nickname
[06:24] <usr13> tion: In the settings manager you should find Display  and you can change screen size resolution there.
[06:24] <jaker44444> Ben64  30 * * * * rm /home/myusername/.wine/drive_c/windows/temp
[06:24] <jaker44444> now that's right ?

[06:25] <jaker44444> so tell me what to do
[06:25] <android> hi
[06:25] <usr13> jaker44444:  30 * * * * rm /wine/windows/tmp/*
[06:25] <Ben64> jaker44444: actually, then do /home/myusername/.wine/drive_c/windows/temp/*
[06:25] <dr_willis> tion:  change your PS1 prompt :) then it wont show the users name
[06:25] <Sail> android: /nick command is fine make sure the name you selected was not already taken
[06:25] <jaker44444> ok thanks
[06:25] <Ben64> jaker44444: just make sure that directory exists first
[06:25] <magn3ts_> dr_willis, lol, not what he needs right now :P
[06:25] <magn3ts_> tion, please run that last command, it does not output your username (or at least didn't for me)
[06:25] <jaker44444> thanks to both of you for the help.. do i need to type anything after i save and exit ?
[06:25] <dr_willis> Hes actually Bill Gates!
[06:25] <usr13> jaker44444: Or, if you need to remove the actual directory:  30 * * * * rm -rf /wine/windows/tmp   (But I doubt that is what you want.)
[06:26] <magn3ts_> jaker44444, what's piling up in there if you don't mind my asking
[06:26] <tion> display model -> crt0 bla bla
[06:26] <magn3ts_> tion, send me the link, please.
[06:26] <Feedhurley> I have never used any server before. And are now going in thoughts of putting up a FTP server. Do you recommend me to use software like filezilla or do you think i should do it by a virtual machine using a server OS ?
[06:26] <usr13> jaker44444: Yea, you need to use the full path to it.
[06:26] <tion> configuration -> disabled
[06:26] <jhansonxi> tion: I don't have an Nvidia system in front of me but I suspect it's disabled because it doesn't have root access.  The ATI utility has a separate "administrator" entry in the menus for making system-wide changes.  Is there a separate Nvidia entry in the menus that prompts for the root/sudo password?

[06:27] <jaker44444> manually
[06:27] <tion> no im running it as root
[06:27] <magn3ts> tion, I'm not going to help you until you send me that link so I can confirm things.
[06:27] <usr13> jaker44444: You need to use the correct full path.  But if it is in the home dir, you can use  wine/windows/tmp     But is it  .wine?
[06:27] <Ben64> tion: don't run it as root :|
[06:28] <jaker44444> yes .wine
[06:28] <jaker44444> so is there a short cut to it ?
[06:28] <dr_willis> You could link Wine to .wine  ;) if you needed to access your .wine directory a lot
[06:28] <magn3ts> For crontab you'll need to use the full path /home/jaker44444/.wine/drive_c/windows/tmp probably...
[06:28] <usr13> jaker44444: short cut?   Just give the correct path.

[06:33] <oospill> I'm on a live 10.04 cd trying to dual install along side win xp (which is on ntfs) .. the ntfs partition is damaged.
[06:33] <tion> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1530159/
[06:33] <magn3ts> jhansonxi, too true, nvidia's prop driver barfs on these cheap Korean panels even though Nouvareu picks up on it just fine even with bad EDID output.
[06:34] <dr_willis> oospill:  the installer tools wont be able to resize a damaged ntfs partion
[06:34] <oospill> I used ntfsresize to change the primary partition, and then used fdisk to create another primary .. linux of course
[06:34] <magn3ts> jhansonxi, I have to manually modeset with `nvidia` :0 I think tion has a simpler problem though.
[06:34] <dr_willis> oospill:  so areyou  sure it succeded? or did you force it some how?
[06:34] <oospill> ahhhh
[06:34] <oospill> I did -f to force
[06:34] <dr_willis> resizeing a damaged ntfs- is not a good idea.. ;)
[06:35] <oospill> no other choice
[06:35] <oospill> when I print the partition list in fdisk it shows the new partition table just fine ..
[06:35] <dr_willis> could have  repired the ntfs...
[06:35] <oospill> did chkdsk /f /r twice
[06:35] <magn3ts> heh that doesn't mean much.
[06:35] <dr_willis> Oh well. Hope you got backups just in case of data loss on the ntfs.
[06:35] <oospill> got backups
[06:35] <magn3ts> I can make my partition table says LOTS of things ;)
[06:35] <oospill> just want to leave the old windows insatll that's all
[06:36] <oospill> right
[06:36] <oospill> cool ... soooo...
[06:36] <rhizmoe> hi all. is there a way to disable the requirement that symlinks to directories need two tab hits to complete out to the slash?
[06:36] <oospill> got the new partition table .. but on my live cd, going up to places, shows the original sized hard disk.
[06:36] <oospill> (80 GB)
[06:36] <tion> what now?
[06:36] <oospill> what now me too
[06:37] <dr_willis> oospill:  hav you rebooted since youve resized?
[06:37] <oospill> yes

[06:37] <Ben64> tion: delete xorg.conf, reboot, start up nvidia-settings and set the resolution

=== rimas is now known as daze
[06:37] <magn3ts> Ben64, if his monitor really isn't putting out EDID info, I fully would expect the nvidia driver to bork on it.
[06:37] <oospill> gparted doesn't want to do anything to the ntfs fs
[06:38] <tion> its not going to work i need a custume IEDI file like on the web page thats for sure
[06:38] <oospill> the fs has a exclamation point next to it
[06:38] <dr_willis> If you have a backup of the ntfs.. id just delete it and restore it from backups.. but a ! may mean its mounted/in use..
[06:38] <dr_willis> check the mount command output - be sure its not mounted
[06:38] <magn3ts> tion, unfortunately, to do that, you either need to fire up nouvareu and get it's settings to write a modeline or EDI file or you're going to need the manual or just take a shot with an EDID calculator
[06:38] <oospill> checking ...
[06:39] <tion> this used to be so eazy once upon a time when you could just edit xorg.conf
[06:39] <Ben64> magn3ts: well the current xorg.conf isn't doing anything
[06:39] <oospill> not mounted. ! for damaged
[06:39] <magn3ts> Ben64, true, true, plus he needs to "reset" since it sounds like nvidia-settings is messed up too
[06:39] <Ben64> oospill: right click and go to information to find out why

[06:41] <rhizmoe> i know that the / means that if i rm -rf it that it will take out the target, but...hmm.
[06:41] <jhansonxi> tion: I'm out of ideas (other than you need get a new PC with PCI-E instead of old AGP)
[06:41] <oospill> this disk has bad sector .. etc .. checkdsk /f /r, then resize with --bad-sectors option of ntfsresize
[06:41] <guest____> hi
[06:41] <guest____> friends
[06:41] <Feedhurley> I have never used any server before. And are now going in thoughts of putting up a FTP server. Do you recommend me to use software like filezilla or do you think i should do it by a virtual machine using a server OS ?
[06:41] <tion> bah
[06:41] <oospill> that's what it says
[06:41] <guest____> is there anyone who have worked with citadel :)
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[06:41] <the_dark_knight> Hi, I know I should ask this in #mysql. But can't connect to #mysql. Has anybody resolved this error before- "ERROR 1205 (HY000): Lock wait timeout exceeded; try restarting transaction" I get this while updating a column of a table using its primary key. Please help me.
[06:41] <magn3ts> guest____, no, sorry. You should just ask your question though.
[06:42] <dr_willis> Feedhurley:  ftp is old and considered a security risk. better to learn to use ssh and sftp
[06:42] <tion> why did they have to make xrandr and break xorg.conf?
[06:42] <magn3ts> the_dark_knight, the first sentence was the best one, especially if it's happening whenever you're executing your update.
[06:42] <tion> MF
[06:42] <guest____> friends i want to upload a sieve script on my citadel server
[06:42] <jhansonxi> tion: You can still edit the file manually.  Just: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf (but make a backup first!)
[06:42] <magn3ts> xrandr broke xorg.conf?
[06:42] <Feedhurley> dr_willis i guess its much more complicated aswell?
[06:42] <dr_willis> Feedhurley:  install the ssh server package.. and start sshing in....
[06:42] <usr13> rhizmoe: So what you want to do is ____________________?
[06:43] <tion> they broke it i used to edit that long ago
[06:43] <dr_willis> Feedhurley:  given the total disasters ive seen happen with ftp.. id say not really. :)
[06:43] <tion> in debian
[06:43] <guest____> magn3ts, as i know managesieve is there to upload
[06:43] <magn3ts> tion, I'm willing to bet money that when you did this in the past you weren't using the `nvidia` driver...
[06:43] <tion> yes i was
[06:43] <tion> and playing urt and quake3
[06:43] <guest____> magn3ts . but i didnt get the way to do that
[06:43] <tion> and et
[06:43] <magn3ts> tion, then they either broke their driver, you can use xrandr or you can still set the res manually in xorg.
[06:43] <tion> and everything worked
[06:44] <magn3ts> tion, Ben's right, delete your xorg.conf and start over.
[06:44] <oospill> ntfsresize shows 'current volume' at 39G and current device size 80G .. that's what I told it to do!! however gparted shows the disk as 80G!!! fdisk shows 37 and 40
[06:44] <oospill> ntfs sux
[06:44] <Feedhurley> dr_willis hmm okey, ill take a look at that. My goal at the moment is not a perfect server, more of learning and then go on get it better and more secure. By the way does ssh let you stream content from your server?
[06:44] <magn3ts> tion, this is like helping my parents do Quicken. They spend 4 hours on it, I go in and reset it and do it from scratch in 10 minutes. sometimes it's time to just go back to a clean slate.
[06:44] <magn3ts> guest____, managesieve? That's dovecot for managing sieve scripts for mail related stuff, as far as I know.
[06:45] <dr_willis> Feedhurley:  stream is a rather broad term. :) a UPNP server can stream video...   samba has 'shares'    you can  mount a remote ssh location to a local directory via sshfs and play stuff.
[06:45] <Ben64> its not like his xorg.conf is full of stuff, its super generic and unnecessary
[06:45] <magn3ts> Mhmm.
[06:45] <oospill> nobody loves me anymore
[06:45] <oospill> =P
[06:45] <tion> i did apt-get install nvidia-current
[06:45] <guest____> magn3ts , u r right
[06:45] <tion> and had 1024.840
[06:46] <tion> but no glx
[06:46] <Hoyt> Hi, Is maverick (10.10) out of support?
[06:46] <Ben64> Hoyt: yep
[06:46] <dr_willis> !10.10
[06:46] <ubottu> Ubuntu 10.10 (Maverick Meerkat) was the thirteenth release of Ubuntu. !End-Of-Life on April 10th, 2012, see http://ubottu.com/y/maverick for details.
[06:46] <tion> is this stupid or what?
[06:46] <magn3ts> oospill, according to the warnings gparted usually spits out, sometimes you need a restart for the kernel to see new partition sizes
[06:46] <Feedhurley> dr_willis is samba a type of server or just a extension software?
[06:46] <guest____> magn3ts as it is also included in the citadel http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation:appproto:manage_sieve
[06:46] <dr_willis> !samba | Feedhurley
[06:46] <magn3ts> but that sounds strange. I avoid resizing and using ntfs for a reason :)
[06:46] <ubottu> Feedhurley: Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
[06:46] <Ben64> tion: so what did you do after that
[06:46] <Hoyt> Thanks
[06:46] <jhansonxi> tion: Create a new default xorg.conf with: http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/225
[06:46] <magn3ts> guest____, yeah, but what's your question about it ?
[06:46] <dr_willis> Feedhurley:  its what does 'windows network type shares'
[06:47] <tion> i installed the recomended driver 173
[06:47] <oospill> magn3ts: I've rebooted.
[06:47] <tion> and back to this stupid res
[06:47] <Ben64> tion: then delete xorg.conf, reboot, start up nvidia-settings and set the resolution
[06:47] <guest____> magn3ts , i want to upload a sieve script manually from GUI
[06:47] <guest____> of citadel
[06:47] <magn3ts> tion, well, do step 1, 2, and 3, but for step 4 of jhansonxi's link, don't use sudo.
[06:48] <Ben64> don't need xorg.conf for 12.04
[06:48] <magn3ts> guest___, yeah, mate you'll probably want to see if citadel has an IRC room or something, best I can do is guess random things like: try to find a mail client that support managesieve and upload with that?
[06:48] <oospill> the short story is I'm living at a sober living house and want to install ubuntu off this 10.04.4 live disc I have, and keep winxp incase everyone hates it.  not my puter.
[06:48] <magn3ts> Ben64, it's still necessary to get X to use the `nvidia` driver isn't it?
[06:48] <oospill> I can get another blank disc tomorrow ..
[06:48] <Ben64> magn3ts: nope
[06:48] <Feedhurley> dr_willis okey :) thank you for the help!
[06:48] <oospill> maybe try some other live discs .. repair the ntfs??
[06:49] <magn3ts> Ben64, oh right, mine is because of my EDID issues, never mind, my mistake.
[06:49] <Ben64> oospill: you need to repair ntfs from windows
[06:49] <dr_willis> oospill:  you can do a install to a usb flash drive if  you needed to.
[06:49] <oospill> I don't have a thumb drive.
[06:49] <oospill> =(
[06:49] <oospill> plus this is a circa '00 dell

[06:50] <oospill> sheeit
[06:50] <jillking> hello
[06:51] <jhansonxi> jillking: If you have a question then just ask it
[06:51] <oospill> alright... let's try a different tack
[06:51] <oospill> ..
[06:51] <oospill> if I can get some blank disks.  is there a way I can backup the current winxp with linux?
[06:52] <rhizmoe> usr13: part<tab> -> `partial/` for symlinks that point to directories
[06:52] <tion> i rm xorg.conf
[06:52] <magn3ts> the one you just got done resizing? hah
[06:52] <oospill> I can put it back.

[06:56] <tion> should i select separate x screen requires restart option?
[06:56] <oospill> so I get some black discs.  what live distros should I get?  something with disk utilities
[06:56] <jhansonxi> oospill: Might be better off replacing the drive first if it has bad sectors.  Also, what video card is the 4100 using?  Why 10.04 and not 12.04 (Precise Pangolin)?
[06:57] <jhansonxi> oospill: Parted Magic is a good utility LiveCD.
[06:57] <Ben64> tion: sure
[06:57] <dr_willis> oospill: theres dozens of handy rescue live cds and partioning live cds out there.
[06:57] <dr_willis> 'system rescue cd' and 'gparted live cd' and  similer ones
[06:58] <oospill> this 4100 is over ten years old.  64 megs of the 512 ram. I had good luck with 10.04 on a similar machine. next? jk
[06:58] <oospill> not my puter.  not with my money
[06:58] <oospill> heh
[06:58] <oospill> my mom's got a similar dell and I put 10.04 on it and it runs real nice.
[06:59] <oospill> the gui in 12 takes up too much resources
[06:59] <oospill> 12.04 that is
[06:59] <Ben64> you can change that
[06:59] <Ben64> 10.04 is only supported for a couple more months
[06:59] <tion> im doing 173-updates
[06:59] <tion> will it help?
[06:59] <dr_willis> 12.10 lubuntu - is very nice
[06:59] <oospill> really?  what does the L stand for?
[06:59] <Ben64> lxde
[06:59] <dr_willis> lxde
[06:59] <tion> Lame
[07:00] <jhansonxi> oospill: Normally I use Xfce on something that old.  It uses less memory and still has a good number of features.
[07:01] <oospill> hmm. maybe I'll try it.
[07:01] <tion> can i upgrade to ubuntu-studio from this ?
[07:02] <tion> mount the iso and do the upgrade?
[07:02] <jhansonxi> oospill: Xubuntu or Linux Mint Xfce edition.  You could add Xfce (xubuntu-desktop package) to Ubuntu but you'll end up with a whole bunchy of programs with redundant purposes.
[07:02] <tion> ubuntu-studio uses Xface
[07:03] <savio> hi all
[07:04] <oospill> welp.  I think I'm gonna buy some cd-r's try out a couple rescue distros.
[07:04] <oospill> maybe get a can of air.

[07:11] <tion> back?
[07:11] <thec4ke> search for a newer nvidia driver?

[07:20] <mladoux> lol
[07:20] <rigo> sometimes if i turn on the htpc the wlan card is not recognised. as the tvcard either. why is that? (it happens randomly and a reboot helps.)

[07:22] <mladoux> biopyte, one second please
=== atrius_away is now known as atrius
[07:24] <mladoux> yeah, the version of 7 in that repository is still 7.10, they usually update quite rapidly though, so I'd give it a couple days
[07:24] <mladoux> @biopyte
[07:24] <alimj> mladoux: biopyte: I still recommend disabling Java in your Browser (by default). Keep it in "Click to activate" mode. I am not sure if 7.11 for Ubuntu is released.
=== alejandro is now known as Guest12439
[07:25] <savio> Just don't use java for some time
[07:25] <alimj> maldoux: biopyte: It is just few hours since the release of 7.11
[07:25] <mladoux> alimj thanks, I'm not worried about it. I don't really use java.
[07:25] <muhfiasbin> can I install Ubuntu for ARM in an Android Smartphone like Motorola Defy+?
[07:25] <savio> is 7.11 fix zero-day
[07:26] <alimj> savio: YES. VERY DANGEROUS BUG
[07:26] <mladoux> biopyte, they'll probably update it soon, especially if there are security concerns

[07:28] <mladoux> which model vrtigo_indx?
[07:28] <savio> vrtigo_indx, explain your issue
[07:28] <vrtigo_indx> so, sometimes wifi will connect with no issues, other times, it connects then dies, and other times it won't connect at all
[07:28] <vrtigo_indx> super unreliable right now
[07:29] <mladoux> yeah, which model of card?
[07:29] <alimj> ONLY USE JAVA IN TRUSTED SITES UNTIL OFFICIAL JAVA 7.11 IS RELEASED
[07:29] <mladoux> not just the brand mind you
[07:29] <vrtigo_indx> sorry i'm new to linux
[07:29] <mladoux> do a lspci and a lsusb it should show on one of those.
[07:29] <biopyte> mladoux, i'm not worrying, but for a reason i dont understand, my java 7.10 is not working anymore since this morning. and i depend on it to do my work.
[07:29] <biopyte> biopyte, just to illustrate the situation
[07:30] <savio> vrtigo_indx, use pspci command and paste the output in pastebin
[07:30] <biopyte> so, i will do the manual install ... which shouldnt be a problem
[07:30] <mladoux> biopyte, sorry, I don't know enough about java to fix that.

[07:36] <bazhang> vrtigo_indx, try the backports modules
[07:36] <mladoux> bazhang thanks for the input. I'm also checking for a possible conflict
[07:37] <mladoux> apparently there are two drivers for this card, and they don't play nice
[07:37] <vrtigo_indx> that's what I figured.
[07:37] <mladoux> vrtigo_indx, did you do the modinfo commands?
[07:37] <vrtigo_indx> I'd previously tried using ubuntu in the past, and it gave me too many headaches, but I figured that was due to the dual boot maybe..
[07:37] <vrtigo_indx> but
[07:37] <vrtigo_indx> ERROR: modinfo: could not find module r8192se_pci
[07:37] <vrtigo_indx> that was the second
[07:37] <mladoux> that's actually good
[07:37] <mladoux> did the first tell you anything?
[07:38] <vrtigo_indx> filename:       /lib/modules/3.2.0-35-generic/kernel/drivers/staging/rtl8192e/r8192e_pci.ko

[07:38] <vrtigo_indx> and first
[07:38] <vrtigo_indx> sorry
[07:38] <mladoux> good, you don't have a conflict
[07:38] <mladoux> you might want to try switching drivers though.
[07:38] <mladoux> one moment.
[07:38] <mladoux> sudo echo "blacklist r8192e_pci" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
[07:39] <mladoux> one sec
[07:39] <mladoux> I'm checking the package name for the other one
[07:39] <vrtigo_indx> got permission denied on that
[07:39] <mladoux> did you remember the sudo?
[07:39] <mladoux> if that didn't work, do sudo su -
[07:39] <vrtigo_indx> yeah, it didn't ask for my password..
[07:39] <mladoux> echo "blacklist r8192e_pci" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
[07:39] <vrtigo_indx> k
[07:40] <mladoux> in one moment, I'll be done checking the package you want
[07:40] <vrtigo_indx> still giving me permission denied
[07:40] <Flannel> mladoux, vrtigo_indx: `echo "blacklist r8192e_pci" | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`
[07:41] <savio> vrtigo_indx, use sudo -i enter your password
[07:41] <mladoux> I'm not finding the package for the other driver
[07:41] <mladoux> lemme try something
[07:41] <vrtigo_indx> Flannel, that worked
[07:44] <Kartagis> why does clicking OK on Typing Break Reminder open my dropbox public folder?
[07:44] <Kartagis> any ideas?

[07:46] <mladoux> @ vrtigo_indx
[07:46] <vrtigo_indx> k
[07:46] <mladoux> you'll need to sudo for it if you're not already root
[07:46] <mladoux> it might just be there already
[07:46] <holmen> rigo: ok. I'm struggeling with a OpenVPN tunnel. I have set it as "local <NIC #2 ip>" but it still tunnels the NIC #1 ip-
[07:47] <mladoux> meanwhile, I'll continue searching

[07:47] <mladoux> darn
[07:47] <mladoux> I was being hopeful
[07:47] <rigo> is it maybe a port forwarding or routing issue?
[07:48] <vrtigo_indx> It is very weird. The wifi worked fine on Windows, must be a driver issue.
[07:48] <holmen> port forwarding is set in the router on NIC #1 and the routing is set to the NIC #2 correctly

[07:50] <bazhang> mladoux, just the backports modules should do it
[07:50] <mladoux> thanks bazhang
[07:50] <vrtigo_indx> couldn't find packages..
[07:51] <mladoux> eh
[07:51] <rigo> vrtigo_indx: your wlan card is not always detected too?

[07:51] <mladoux> his card is detected, but it keeps dropping, we're trying for an alt driver.
[07:52] <rigo> strange. mine is not listed in dmesg nor in lspci nor in ifconfig -a
[07:53] <mladoux> vrtigo_indx, try "sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-`uname -r`
[07:53] <mladoux> minus that first double quote.

[07:54] <vrtigo_indx> Unable to locate package linux-backports-modules-cw
[07:55] <vrtigo_indx> would I need a specific repository for that?
[07:55] <mladoux> did you remember the backticks?
[07:55] <mladoux> sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw-`uname -r`
[07:55] <dr_willis> WeThePeople:  the .history file
[07:55] <mladoux> like so
[07:55] <vrtigo_indx> yeah, that's what I used
[07:55] <vrtigo_indx> >>$ sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-cw- `uname -r`
[07:56] <mladoux> because `uname-r` should print something like 3.5.0-21-generic
[07:56] <mladoux> no space
[07:56] <mladoux> the space messes it up
[07:56] <vrtigo_indx> that didn't work either..
[07:56] <mladoux> ah, okay
[07:56] <vrtigo_indx> the first time it noted the packages
[07:56] <vrtigo_indx> but couldn't find them

[07:58] <mladoux> I'm thinking
[07:58] <bazhang> vrtigo_indx, do you have the backports repo enabled?
[07:58] <vrtigo_indx> I'm not too sure...
[07:58] <vrtigo_indx> how could I check?
[07:59] <bazhang> vrtigo_indx, once it's enabled (check in software sources <system settings> or synaptic) the be sure to update sources
[08:00] <mladoux> 32 bit or 64-bit

[08:20] <evilthought> I have 2 TB USB drive formated as EXT4. It's connected to the router directly (RT-N56U). What do I need do do so that anyone (windows, iphone, tablets) can create and  delete files? I am having permission issues ... should I format it as EXT2?
[08:20] <krz> IdleOne: its all complaints in there :-P
[08:20] <krz> am not surprised
[08:21] <IdleOne> evilthought: NTFS would be supported by those other OSes
[08:21] <IdleOne> evilthought: Windows Can't write to etx4
[08:22] <rigo> no no. 12.10
[08:22] <rigo> x64
[08:22] <evilthought> I was having issue with NTFS with this router (corrupted lpost files every few months). RT-N56u is after all linux based
[08:22] <rigo> here is a small desc: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=12454306#post12454306
[08:24] <iceroot> evilthought: and how is it related to ubuntu?
[08:24] <rigo> the wlan card  was just fine under w7
[08:24] <evilthought> The question is how do I set the permission so that everyone on the network can delete files? Right now I can only read files via the network
[08:24] <alimj> evilthought: I would recommend to try DD-WRT channels
[08:24] <cfhowlett> evilthought, or maybe in #ubuntu-server??
[08:24] <thec4ke> are you using samba?
[08:25] <alimj> evilthought: DD-WR guys are much better with routers
[08:25] <evilthought> It'e EXT4 permission question -- nothing to do with  DD-WRT
[08:25] <IdleOne> evilthought: The issue is not linux, the issue is windows not being able to write to ext4 (deleting a file is writing to disk)
=== anderson is now known as Guest21601
[08:25] <cfhowlett> evilthought, or you might make that particular partition windows friendly, i.e. NTFS ...
[08:26] <evilthought> IdleOne, that's not the issue .. the windows doen't read the files directly. The drive is connected to the router
[08:26] <alimj> evilthought: Most ASUS modems work differently with attached USB HDDs. Some routers support FTP uploads only
[08:26] <evilthought> That's not the issuie .. I can play the video from Windows machine just fine
[08:26] <IdleOne> playing a video is reading, which windows can do from ext4
[08:26] <iceroot> evilthought: and how is it related to ubuntu? this is the ubuntu support channel and not the windows/router/ntfs channel
[08:27] <IdleOne> also what iceroot is saying, it isn't an Ubuntu issue
=== dziegler_off is now known as dziegler
[08:27] <evilthought> I can play video files, read pdf every thing works just fine. But I can delete a fgile .. it's ext4 permission issue
[08:27] <evilthought> can't
[08:27] <alimj> evilthought: Playing video could also be throught DLNA
[08:27] <alimj> evilthought: Did you try to upload files to it throught FTP?
[08:28] <evilthought> It's EXT4 ownership isue
[08:28] <thec4ke> evilthought: how are you connecting to the router from your pc, windows network?
[08:28] <IdleOne> evilthought: NO the issue is you not understanding, Windows CAN NOT write to ext4, when you delete a file you are writing to disk.
[08:28] <evilthought> Yes, Windows network .. even Android phone can connect to the drive via the router and play videos or read files just fine
[08:29] <iceroot> evilthought: windows is not seeing ext4, windows is seeing samba(cifs) or ntfs so its not a ext4 issue
[08:29] <alimj> Evilthought: If you think it is permission issue, connect it to a Linux Desktop and do a "chmod a+w" on the drive
[08:29] <iceroot> evilthought: and its offtopic as i said two times already
[08:29] <evilthought> I know that ..
[08:29] <iceroot> s/ntfs/nfs
[08:29] <thec4ke> evilthought: are you connecting anonymously or do you have username/password setup on the router?
=== Guest21601 is now known as nDer
[08:30] <alimj> Iceroot: I agree with You 8-)
[08:30] <evilthought> Didn't I already say that NTFS was not working properly with the router? It's linux based router .. NTFS was slow and files were being corrupted
[08:30] <evilthought> Anounymously
[08:31] <IdleOne> ok, enough. This is off topic and not an Ubuntu issue. Please take it elsewhere
[08:31] <iceroot> evilthought: then you are connecting as a guest and not as the owner of a file
[08:31] <iceroot> evilthought: guests/others/world does not have write permission by default
[08:31] <iceroot> evilthought: and its offtopic!!!
[08:31] <thec4ke> I'll try to point you in the right direction:  this has nothing to do with ntfs, it's an issue with samba if your router is running linux
[08:31] <alimj> evilthought: ASUS modems have some AiDisk. However, it is offtopic as icreroot said earlier
[08:32] <evilthought> "guests/others/world does not have write permission by default" .. exactly .. bow we are on topic. How do I change permission (from Ubuntu) so that guests can the ownsership
[08:32] <thec4ke> basically you have to map the anonymous login to an account on the router and give that account write permission to things
[08:33] <evilthought> I cn connect the drive to Ubuntu VM and change permissions so that guests have full access to the folders .. but the question is how?
[08:33] <evilthought> let me paste the screen shot from ubuntu VM
[08:34] <apm1> why can't i have 2 x sessions on 2 diff. ttys ?
[08:34] <iceroot> evilthought: dont change the permission (to 777) use user-mapping on samba
[08:34] <alimj> apm1: You can
[08:34] <iceroot> apm1: why not?
[08:34] <apm1> well i just had a fatal xserver error here
[08:35] <thec4ke> apm1: did you try starting on a different display
[08:35] <thec4ke> virtual display*
[08:35] <apm1> no
[08:35] <thec4ke> i think you can do "DISPLAY=:1 startx" or something  similar
[08:35] <apm1> a tried on a diff tty by switching with alt+ctrl+f1
[08:35] <thec4ke> that wont work
[08:36] <thec4ke> DISPLAY needs to be set to something
[08:36] <apm1> no
[08:36] <thec4ke> :0 is the first display
[08:36] <apm1> yes
[08:36] <thec4ke> you get others as you increase the number
[08:36] <thec4ke> set that environment variable then try startx
[08:36] <apm1> ok
[08:36] <apm1> thec4ke, thanks , that worked :)

[08:40] <hilarious> i'm trying to modify what internet host is seen by other machines i connect to from my machine
[08:40] <hilarious> right now it is showing a mail server address
[08:40] <hilarious> anyone know whether i can change the default host that my ip resolves to without breaking my email ?
[08:41] <thec4ke> hilarious: is this over the internet or on a lan?
[08:41] <hilarious> rackspace cloud
[08:42] <hilarious> i'm not really running a mail server but i have one address being forwarded through it

[08:42] <hilarious> and several domains pointing to it
[08:42] <hilarious> it's over the internet like for example, if i connect to www.displaymyhostname.com
[08:42] <hilarious> it displays my mail server name
[08:43] <hilarious> i would assume then it also shows up in server connection logs etc
[08:43] <hilarious> when i connect to other sites
[08:44] <thec4ke> so you want sites on the internet to see your hostname?
[08:45] <hilarious> no i don't want them to really
[08:45] <hilarious> i realize they can look it up but if my hostname is going to resolve and show up in server logs
[08:45] <hilarious> i want to specify another one
[08:45] <thec4ke> thats a dns issue
[08:45] <hilarious> but i don't want to break my email
[08:46] <thec4ke> whoever has the public dns server controls your hostname online
[08:46] <thec4ke> which is probably your isp
[08:46] <thec4ke> if its you you need to set up your dns records
[08:46] <hilarious> you mean it has nothing to do with /etc/postfix/main.cf or other local file configurations on my machine ?
=== krzkrzkrz is now known as krz
[08:47] <thec4ke> your actual hostname has nothing to do with mail server configuration
=== ryanclancy000 is now known as Guest51552
[08:47] <thec4ke> unless your talking about something the mail servers log
[08:47] <thec4ke> in which case idk
[08:47] <hilarious> that's fine but what does it have to do with
[08:48] <hilarious> like i said i have several domains pointing to the machine but it seems the default one the IP resolves to is mail.whatever.com
[08:48] <hilarious> and i don't want that domain to be the default at all, let alone the mail server subdomain for it
[08:49] <thec4ke> but you want certain machines to see mail.whatever.com?
[08:49] <thec4ke>  but not the internet?
[08:49] <holmen> So i'm trying this again. Anyone online that is good with tunneling specific NIC through OpenVPN (i am not the host admin). I've got two separate NIC's with two diffrerent external IP's. I have setup a tunnel with "local <NIC #2 ext ip>" but i still tunnels the NIC #1.
[08:49] <Thor> anyone know where I can get help with fish? (the shell)
[08:50] <hilarious> ohir, i see that it is in my reverse DNS settings
[08:50] <hilarious> thecake - not really i mean i want mail to that domain to come to the machine
[08:51] <hilarious> i don't want machines to look at my IP and automatically resolve it to my mail server domain over any of my other domains
[08:51] <hilarious> but that is what it seems to do
[08:51] <hilarious> but i see that it's because i have reverse DNS set to that host
[08:53] <thec4ke> k so you wanted your ip to resolve to something other than mail.whatever.com

[08:53] <Annihilator> Hey guys. I use MessageBox(NULL, "Title", "Text", NULL); in windows. What is alternative for Ubuntu system ?
[08:54] <Annihilator> i'm new to Linux coding.
[08:55] <Thor> Annihilator: it depends a lot on what language you are coding in, and what gui framework you are using, best is to find the channel for the framework you are using and ask there
[08:55] <Annihilator> C++

[08:56] <Annihilator> Hmmm... I use SDL with OpenGL.
[08:57] <Thor> Annihilator: create your own message box in SDL/OpenGL, or use eg. glib
[08:58] <Annihilator> So there is no asy alterbnative like including <windows.h> and just calling messagebox
[08:58] <Ruby> hey
[08:58] <Thor> Annihilator: I don't know, it highly depends on the gui framework you use, eg. with kwin it's not too far from that simple.
[08:59] <god> can someone please help me?
[08:59] <dr_willis> State the problem
[08:59] <Ruby> hello I need some help
[08:59] <Ruby> I dont have a problem but I need to know how to do something
[08:59] <Ruby> boot ubuntu into readonly
[08:59] <god> i am a newbie on ubuntu and am having trouble getting the sound to sync up with the video
[09:00] <Ruby> I have a system already set up
[09:00] <Ruby> I dont want to set up a new one unless it is a mirrored readonly one
[09:00] <Ruby> just want to modify grub or something
[09:00] <dr_willis> Ruby:  you mount specific partions/filesystems as read only. ive never seen a 'reboot into read only' mode
[09:01] <Ruby> how do I do that?
[09:01] <dr_willis> You can have most of / as read only except for a few system directories
[09:01] <dr_willis> its not a trivial thing.
[09:01] <god> i watch television online but i cannot get the sound to sync to the video
[09:01] <Ruby> I am a lil bit new
[09:01] <evilthought> I solved my problem!
[09:01] <dr_willis> Ruby:  why do you need to do this?
[09:01] <cfhowlett> !patience|god
[09:01] <ubottu> god: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[09:02] <Ruby> why does that matter?
[09:02] <thec4ke> because mounting everything readonly will probably break some things
[09:02] <dr_willis> Ruby:  because tehre may be better ways to do whatever it is you are trying to acomplish
[09:02] <dr_willis> You CAN have most of the system read only. but not all of it.
[09:02] <Ruby> making so I dont write any data to my HDD
[09:02] <Ruby> like malware
[09:02] <evilthought> I had to use "# chmod -R 777 /media/AiDisk_a1: inside router console
[09:03] <thec4ke> theres basically no malware for linux
[09:03] <iceroot> evilthought: 777 is always bad
[09:03] <thec4ke> unless you do something very wrong
[09:03] <dr_willis> Ruby:  if your user does somthing to install malware - then it will only affect teh users home dir/files
[09:03] <Ruby> ok
[09:03] <iceroot> evilthought: and still!! offtopic
[09:03] <Ruby> well its not a topic that I like talking about
[09:03] <god> can someone please help me?
[09:03] <evilthought> obviously there was solution
[09:03] <Ruby> mostly log files
[09:03] <iceroot> evilthought: make something insecure is never a solution
[09:04] <Ruby> metadata gets stroed in places when I dont want it to
=== trekkit is now known as egarals
[09:04] <dr_willis> Ruby:  search for guides on having a read only system i guess. theres no trivial check ox  option to do it as far as i know.
[09:04] <Ruby> I want to do it temporarily to a partition I already have ;)
[09:04] <thec4ke> the easy was is add the ro option to /etc/fstab
[09:04] <Ruby> I have done googling
[09:04] <evilthought> there is no OS on this drive. It's a USB drive with mostly video files connected to the router. There is no need for security here
[09:04] <Ruby> ok ill google that
[09:04] <thec4ke> but i guarantee that will break something
[09:04] <dr_willis> Ruby:  you can use the ro option.. but you may make a unuseable system
[09:05] <Ruby> I can reboot into non-ro and it will function properly?
[09:05] <hilarious> anyone know if i can tile my windows in ubuntu ?
[09:05] <thec4ke> yes
[09:05] <hilarious> or at least terminal windows ?
[09:05] <thec4ke> but
[09:05] <thec4ke> youll need a recovery console
[09:05] <thec4ke> to edit fstab
[09:05] <Ruby> ok
[09:05] <god> what is a good way to sync sound and video?
[09:05] <Ruby> I can go into that easily with grub
[09:06] <thec4ke> at minimum you need /var and /home to be writable just to use the system
[09:06] <cfhowlett> god, NONE of your videos are sound/video sync'd?
[09:07] <god> no
[09:07] <Ruby> that might be a issue seeing as /var/log and /home/name/.bash_history
[09:07] <god> youtube is fine but vlc is acting crazy
[09:07] <dr_willis> Ruby:  and more then just those i imagine
[09:07] <cfhowlett> god, easiest way ... try a different player.
[09:07] <hilarious> what is my window manager if i use gnome classic ?
[09:08] <god> which one do you recomend?
[09:08] <hilarious> by default ?
[09:08] <Ruby> I am making a distro currently for personal use and I dont want to get all my files that are not supposed to be there on the system and such..
[09:08] <cfhowlett> god movie player works well for me ...
[09:08] <Ruby> well maybe I could make it so it writes everything into ram
[09:08] <Ruby> boots the HDD like its a livecd
[09:08] <Ruby> nothing changable
[09:08] <god> well, sometimes the site i stream off of only lets me use certain ones
[09:09] <cfhowlett> god, pretty sure you'll find movie player works with most providers ...
[09:09] <god> i will try it.
[09:09] <god> thanks!
[09:09] <cfhowlett> god, but if not, rather than stream the video, download and save it to play offline
[09:09] <cfhowlett> god, no worries.  have fun, be safe.
[09:09] <god> i would download, but i have little to no space on this computer
[09:10] <cfhowlett> god, understood.
[09:10] <evilthought> this solved the problem http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8195/8379017919_93b86f77c0_b.jpg
[09:10] <god> i stream usually vlc works well and sometime putlocker does, but both have been crazy
[09:11] <Ruby> ill try -ro..
[09:11] <god> i was trying to stream from cbs.com earlier and it was nuts too
[09:11] <cfhowlett> god, vlc is fickle that way ...
[09:12] <god> how can stream but pick a player that works?
[09:12] <cfhowlett> god, yep.
[09:13] <god> is there a way to do that?
[09:13] <cfhowlett> god, I think you'd need to start the player then navigate to the stream ...
[09:14] <god> i have no idea how to do that
[09:14] <cfhowlett> god also see the xine player
[09:14] <god> i will check zine out
[09:14] <god> xine
[09:14] <cfhowlett> god,  right
[09:15] <cfhowlett> god, xine definitely has streaming capability.  check the support site for details on set up.

[09:18] <dr_willis> hkn1:  you normally cant run mac/os-x binaries on linux
[09:19] <dr_willis> a .dmg is a OS-X disk image last i looked. ( i coul dbe wrong)
[09:19] <hkn1> yes thats right so it's not possible ? :(
[09:20] <dr_willis> ive not seen a OS-X equilivent to wine on linux. ;)
[09:20] <dr_willis> Unless you could do OS-X in  vbox or somting
[09:21] <hkn1> Hmm, i saw something about a dmg2img thing didnt understand it XD
[09:21] <dr_willis> that would just convert it to a standard ISO type image..
[09:21] <dr_willis> thats NOT running anything
[09:21] <thec4ke> is the .img an actual program or just files
[09:21] <hkn1> it's a .dmg file from Apple Devolpment.
[09:22] <hkn1> a program
[09:22] <dr_willis> I recall OS-X likieng to distribute programs in sort of a 'packaged archive' you sort of run. :)
[09:22] <dr_willis>  like double clicking the .dmg would run the app in the package. sort of a neat trick
[09:22] <thec4ke> yea you can probably extract it but i doubt you would be able to run whats inside
[09:23] <hkn1> Hmm ok
[09:24] <hkn1> And have another problem, i can't download Wine. Tried almost anything on google but didnt work at all

[09:25] <thec4ke> sudo apt-get update?
[09:25] <cfhowlett> hkn1, the error is? ...

[09:34] <cfhowlett> !nounity|rabbit_,
[09:34] <ubottu> rabbit_,: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[09:38] <untaken> dv-: I use xmonad via .xsession. I have just done a fresh install on Ubtuntu, but xinerama doesn't look like its enabled in gdm, or when I login to xmonad. It works in unity though. Any ideas?

[09:39] <vlt> Hello. I use Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. After the last Thunderbird update my home dir exploded. ~/.thunderbird has grown to about 10 GB while the maildir size on the server is only 2 GB. Any idea how to fix this?
[09:40] <dv-> untaken: how are you checking if it's enabled?
[09:41] <untaken> dv- I am not, but when I logout of unity, gdm is on both monitors. When xinerama is enabled, I have one for the login and one blank with the backdrop only.
[09:41] <ActionParsnip> untaken: have you troed a different session? like xfce?
[09:42] <untaken> dv-: as its not enabled at the gdm point, when I login to xmonad, I also notice that firefox for instance is on both windows
[09:42] <dv-> untaken: the displays are cloned? or the window is maximized over both screens?
[09:42] <gfixler> python
[09:42] <untaken> I don't have xfce installed, but its definitely a xinerama issue, as gdm should be showing it correctly
[09:42] <untaken> dv-: they are cloned yes
[09:43] <Sri19> how do i install multiple versions on firefox on ubuntu? any ppas / repos to use?

[09:43] <ubottu> Sri19: A Personal Package Archive (PPA) can provide alternate software not normally available in the offical Ubuntu repositories - Looking for a PPA? See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+ppas - WARNING: PPAs are unsupported third-party packages, and you use them at your own risk. See also !addppa and !ppa-purge
[09:43] <dv-> untaken: well you can fix that by calling xrandr after xmonad, but i'm not sure where you'd put it to change the gdm login

[09:46] <dv-> untaken: it does seem odd that logging out of unity would affect gdm like that
[09:46] <hkn1> cfhowlett thanks it works now haha :P
[09:47] <untaken> it does...Do you know if the displays section in the cp writes to a file or something? I noticed there is no longer a xorg.conf file
[09:48] <Marscr> hola alguien me puede ayudar?
[09:49] <iceroot> Sri19: you need ppas where the package is not called firefox but firefox18 and so on, because you can only install one package with the same name
[09:49] <iceroot> Sri19: also you should only use the stable version
[09:50] <dv-> untaken: i believe xorg.conf is basically no longer necessary because everything is autodetected. you can still write one though. running X -configure as root should give you a basic xorg.conf
[09:50] <Sri19> ice799, i know.. its for testing an app ... is there any such ppa with multiple versions?

[10:32] <ikonia> arabi: by reading the numbers from the command I just told you
[10:32] <arabi> but once the connection is reset ... everything gone right?
[10:33] <arabi> when I connect again it starts from zero , i think
[10:33] <ikonia> arabi: it will depend on when the counters are reset,

[10:56] <cfhowlett> computer, brasero
[10:57] <MonkeyDust> JohnFlux_  it's dpkg -i blah.deb    not sure about remote dependencies, tho
[10:58] <yeats> JohnFlux_: no, but dpkg will let you know what's missing
[10:58] <hkn1> MonkeyDust, do you need first to go to the path to install the .deb ?
[10:58] <JohnFlux_> sometimes it seems possible to do:  dpkg -i file.deb ; apt-get install -f
[10:59] <JohnFlux_> but i'm not sure when that works exactly
[10:59] <MonkeyDust> hkn1  if it's local, then yes
[11:00] <meet> Can I have a pure gnome3 experience in ubuntu?
[11:00] <hkn1> Aah ok , than i'll open it with Software Centrum easier XD
[11:00] <cfhowlett> !nounity|meet,
[11:00] <ubottu> meet,: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[11:04] <meet> cfhowlett: but is it complete as in fedora or other gnome 3 based distros?
[11:05] <cfhowlett> meet, doubtful but see this ... http://www.filiwiese.com/installing-gnome-on-ubuntu-12-04-precise-pangolin/

[11:28] <f2> when running "sudo apt=get install mysql-server-core-5.5, i get unable to locate package
[11:29] <MrPop> What's the name of that application that installs proprietary drivers for you?
[11:29] <rileyp> edit etc/resolve and add nameserver (ip address of router)

=== TheRainbowDawn is now known as Braeburn
[11:30] <ActionParsnip> f2: did you run:  sudo apt-get update     first?
[11:31] <rileyp> or edit default route in network manager to ip address of your router
[11:31] <cfhowlett> f2, no shortage of tutorials for that and probably more detailed info than you'll get in channel.
[11:31] <f2> nope, i will run that now and let you know
[11:31] <ActionParsnip> rileyp: resolv.conf is generated, so rebooting will undo the change
[11:31] <rileyp> lol ok my bad
=== MrPop is now known as MrPopinjay
[11:31] <ActionParsnip> rileyp: also, you don't need to reboot to apply the DNS change, its conulted each time :)

[11:33] <f2> hmm, yes we are :/ sorry i should of said
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> f2: then you need to define the proxy in /etc/apt/apt.conf

[11:36] <mvt007geek> i installed internet download manager with wine.but when i wanted to enable  advanced browser integration gave me error.what should i do?

[11:46] <BillyZane|2> hi
[11:46] <BillyZane|2> it's me again
[11:46] <BillyZane|2> i got a question.... I tried to update my video card drivers on gnome (GTX 660) and it was a huge failure, i had to remove them
[11:46] <f2> still not geting out correctly ActionParsnip :(
[11:47] <f2> is it because i having joined the domain?
[11:47] <D_Russ> im looking for a way to access and download files (large or small) on my home computer from any computer connected to the internet. Anyone know of an easy way to accomplish this for an ubuntu newbie?
[11:47] <BillyZane|2> right now i'm on kubuntu and i opened up "additional drivers" utility. it found 3 different types of nvidia drivers for me to install. Now my fear is that if i try installing them, it will cause a system instability like last time. should this happen, how would i remove these drivers using  terminal?
[11:48] <f2> 407 proxy authentication required. (Forefront TMG requires authorization to fulfill the request)
[11:48] <ActionParsnip> Diegosnat: have you looked in exim4.conf ?
[11:48] <f2> would I edit the apt.conf file for a static ip? my spare ip should bypass the proxy all together
[11:48] <Diegosnat> yes
[11:49] <ActionParsnip> Diegosnat: ntlm_sasl_server is defined there
[11:49] <ActionParsnip> Diegosnat: is it correct?
[11:50] <BillyZane|2> if i could only get my drivers to work, i wouldn't need to go back to windows!!! this is so painful. new hardware and no support
[11:50] <Ch1LL3r>  i know that feel bro =/
[11:50] <Diegosnat> yes
[11:50] <Diegosnat> ActionParsnip, it is
[11:50] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: what hardware?
[11:50] <Diegosnat> I need to use that
[11:50] <ActionParsnip> Diegosnat: is there an exim channel?
[11:50] <Diegosnat> but it seems not to find the library
[11:50] <BillyZane|2> MSI Geforce GTX 660
[11:51] <BillyZane|2> and creative sound blaster Z
[11:51] <Ch1LL3r> i own a lenovo ideapad and dont get 2 of my 3 usb connections to work lol
[11:51] <Diegosnat> ActionParsnip, what's that?
[11:51] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: tried the xorg update PPA?
[11:51] <ActionParsnip> Diegosnat: /j #exim
[11:51] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: : i have not, what is that?
[11:51] <Diegosnat> ActionParsnip, =D
[11:52] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: creative soundcards arent worth the headache
[11:52] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip:  i could return it, it's within the return period, but i would like to get it to work

=== bikes_ is now known as nicebikes
[11:53] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[11:53] <BillyZane|2> hmmm
[11:53] <BillyZane|2> i'm 4 days old to linux
[11:53] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: does the motherboard have onboard sound?
[11:54] <BillyZane|2> my motherboard does, but i'm an audiophile
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: press CTRL+ALT+T  and run the command, what is output?
[11:54] <apm1> i just installed openbox
[11:54] <BillyZane|2> one second..
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: then did you disable the onboard sound card?
[11:54] <apm1> and saw the unity panel act weird
[11:54] <apm1> my suspision that openbox won't work wit compiz
[11:54] <apm1> is true then
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: creative stuff is only middle of the road you know, its not that spectacular. Most onboard stuff does what creative stuff does
[11:54] <DarsVaeda> anyone know a good tool to replace multiple lines in multiple files
[11:55] <D_Russ> im looking for a way to access and download files (large or small) on my home computer from any computer connected to the internet. Anyone know of an easy way to accomplish this for an ubuntu newbie?
[11:55] <ActionParsnip> apm1: compiz and openbox are both window managers. You can run one or the other
[11:55] <BillyZane|2> i typed in "cat /etc/issue" and i got Ubuntu 12.10 \n \l
[11:55] <WXZ> I just created a partition on a new disk, it's mounted, but I can't read/write to it
[11:55] <apm1> ActionParsnip, i purged openbox then
[11:55] <apm1> ActionParsnip, will things be as before? , they should be
[11:56] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: : is there a generic driver out there?
[11:56] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: : oh, the on board sound is disabled
[11:56] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: if you enable the proposed repo, you can install the 310 driver
[11:57] <ActionParsnip> apm1: you can tell the OS to use compiz as you want
=== diego_ is now known as Diegthito
[11:57] <apm1> ActionParsnip, i don't get it
[11:57] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: if you remove nvidia-current and install nvidia-graphics-drivers-experimental-310    then it may help
[11:58] <ActionParsnip> apm1: when you log in to the Gnome session, you will use compiz as expected
[11:58] <apm1> ActionParsnip, ok and ?
[11:58] <WXZ> I just created a partition on a new disk, it's mounted, but I can't read/write to it, what do?
[11:58] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: Nvidia current causes my computer to straight up CRASH
[11:58] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: well.. not crash, but the GUI crashes
[11:58] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: have you tried generating an xorg.conf file?
[11:59] <BillyZane|2> i have not, and i can try, however, i wanted to figure out a way to remove it if it fails like nvidia-current did
[11:59] <BillyZane|2> the way i removed nvidia current was..... sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current
[11:59] <BillyZane|2> can i use a similar command to install and remove the xorg drivers?
[11:59] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: sudo nvidia-xconfig     reboot to test
[12:00] <apm1> i am not sure what is happening here
[12:01] <BillyZane|2> what does sudo nvidia-xconfig do?
[12:01] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: generates an xorg.conf
[12:01] <BillyZane|2> that must be done before i start?
[12:01] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: run the command and reboot
[12:01] <BillyZane|2> is it something that xorg drivers require before installing
[12:01] <BillyZane|2> ok
[12:02] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: it can be needed if your monitor isn't reporting EDID.
[12:02] <BillyZane|2> ok
[12:02] <BillyZane|2> umm one sec..
[12:02] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: cheap monitors usually need this :)
[12:02] <BillyZane|2> not sure if that's what mine is

[12:05] <D_Russ> im looking for a way to access and download files (large or small) on my home computer from any computer connected to the internet. Anyone know of an easy way to accomplish this for an ubuntu newbie?
[12:05] <SmokeyD> I want to lower it
[12:06] <ActionParsnip> D_Russ: install openssh-server   and you will get an SFTP server. You can access this securely over the web if you port forward TCP/22 in your router to the IP of the server
[12:06] <ActionParsnip> SmokeyD: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[12:06] <SmokeyD> ActionParsnip: I am using precise pangolin with gnome desktop

[12:07] <ActionParsnip> D_Russ: run:  ip addre
[12:07] <ActionParsnip> D_Russ: run:  ip addr
[12:08] <D_Russ> okay thanks
[12:08] <ActionParsnip> D_Russ: you'll authenticate as the user on the system. you can even connect from Windows using Filezilla etc
[12:09] <D_Russ> actionparsnip: was kind of hoping for some sort of wed app like owncloud or something similar.
[12:09] <ActionParsnip> D_Russ: you can see your WAN IP with:  http://ipchicken.com
[12:10] <ActionParsnip> D_Russ: not sure there, an sftp server is super quick and easy, and secure

[12:12] <rileyp> ah ok .... I like deluge.... well its what I use never even tried transmission.
[12:12] <D_Russ> Great thanks for the help actionparsnip and rileyp
[12:12] <ActionParsnip> rileyp: its default, worth advising that, saves removing and adding apps :)

[12:21] <BillyZane|2> i'm using kubuntu atm. it looks quite nice. i can't even tell the drivers arn't installed. but they are not, and i don't think i can get my video card to accelerate my GUI without them
[12:22] <JuJuBee> I have a lab of 25 computers.  What is the best way to get Ubuntu installed on each with identical configs (all same computers)?
[12:23] <rileyp>  BillyZane|2 http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/ubuntu-quetzal-nvidia.html
[12:24] <BillyZane|2> nileyp, i will give that a read :)
[12:24] <Ben64> JuJuBee: set up on one then clone to the others
[12:24] <Hyperbyte> JuJuBee, LTSP.
[12:24] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: try:  sudo apt-get install nvidia-graphics-drivers-experimental-310
[12:24] <Hyperbyte> JuJuBee, check http://www.ltsp.org/
[12:25] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: : ok, i'll give that a try
[12:26] <Hyperbyte> JuJuBee, you can deploy fat client images over the network quite easily with even a very low powered server.  Means only one installation to set up/maintain, and 25 or more clients that benefit from it.
[12:29] <JuJuBee> Hyperbyte: nice.  Looks great.  I have a Core2 Duo 2.2G with 8G RAM on my server and new computers i5 3.26G with 8G RAM clients.  Seems like they should be reversed :D
[12:29] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip:  the link rileyp gave was great
[12:30] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip:  evidently the regular install causes major problems, which is what i was experiencing
[12:30] <BillyZane|2> only problem is, my internet is so whack right now, i don't think i could even attempt this
[12:31] <Hyperbyte> JuJuBee, well, there's ltsp-pnp, which has identical image/software for thin and fat clients.  Meaning, let's say you get a computer which is totally underpowered, you can let it be a thin client and use the server's hardware to run the software.   From a user experience it won't make a single difference.  I could explain more in #ltsp if you like.
[12:32] <PatrickDickey> Hyperbyte: Isn't that one of the concepts behind Edubuntu? In other words, that's something they offer
[12:32] <Hyperbyte> PatrickDickey, actually, Edubuntu installs/configures LTSP by default during setup.  LTSP is included in all Ubuntu variants.
[12:33] <PatrickDickey> Hyperbyte, that's what I thought. I know Edubuntu actually uses it as a feature though (I've never really heard of it in the other variants--only Edubuntu).
[12:34] <Hyperbyte> Well, Edubuntu was created around LTSP. :)  It includes other educational software as well.  LTSP is used in lots of schools around the world.
[12:34] <JuJuBee> Hyperbyte: I will join #ltsp if you don't mind
[12:34] <Hyperbyte> JuJuBee, it's a public channel.  Sure.

[12:38] <noiro> Is there a standalone X11 forwarding program I can use with Putty for Windows?
[12:39] <Ben64> Xming
[12:39] <noiro> Ben64: but don't you have to install it?
[12:39] <Ben64> ...yes
[12:39] <noiro> Then it is not standalone. :P
[12:39] <noiro> I need to just run it off a flashdrive.
[12:39] <Ben64> you keep using that word, i don't think it means what you think it means
[12:40] <noiro> I could have sworn it means its dependency files cna be stored in a file and you can run it from them. :P
[12:41] <Ben64> the word you're looking for is "portable"
[12:41] <noiro> Gah, fine. But does one exist?

[12:43] <BillyZane|2> ok
[12:43] <BillyZane|2> sigh
[12:43] <BillyZane|2> i followed the instructions on this page

[12:44] <noiro> Ahh ok, thanks. Taking notes with nano, and pulling files is a pain.
[12:44] <BillyZane|2> the second last step, it said file not found. so i did the last step anyway. at that point it restarted and went in to some weird mode where it just did nothing, so i reset the computer. now my desktop looks really crappy, the screen resolution is awful
[12:45] <Ben64> BillyZane|2:  modprobe nvidia_current ?
[12:46] <BillyZane|2> yes

[12:49] <BillyZane|2> ok

[12:52] <BillyZane|2> well, evidently i don't know how to do a file search
[12:52] <hamnamnom> i use php with apache
[12:53] <hamnamnom> and cli
[12:53] <Ben64> BillyZane|2: from the command line you can just do "ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
[12:53] <BillyZane|2> file does not exist
[12:53] <Ben64> BillyZane|2: what happens if you do "modprobe nvidia"

[12:55] <Ben64> oh
[12:56] <Ben64> i'd recommend purging all the nvidia packages, and starting over, but using 310 since its better
[12:56] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: hence the 'rc' for the package in the pastebin
[12:56] <BillyZane|2> i feel like i messed up
[12:56] <BillyZane|2> i'll try that then
[12:56] <BillyZane|2> how do i purge?
[12:56] <BillyZane|2> after purging i should try the command action gave me
[12:56] <Ben64> his purges the 310
[12:57] <BillyZane|2> ok
[12:57] <BillyZane|2> i'll do that now

[12:59] <Ben64> just that one line?
[12:59] <BillyZane|2> yup
[13:00] <Ben64> cause from your lsmod pastebin, it looks like you have an intel card too
[13:00] <BillyZane|2> oh yeah, i have on board video
[13:00] <BillyZane|2> it's enabled atm
[13:00] <BillyZane|2> i think that might cause some issues

[13:01] <Ben64> yeah might work better
[13:01] <BillyZane|2> should i do that now?
[13:02] <BillyZane|2> before i restart, is there any commands i should use to clean up the mess i made?

[13:03] <BillyZane|2> sure
[13:03] <Ben64> oh no, its not reinstall bad
[13:04] <BillyZane|2> ls: cannot access /lib/modules/uname -r/updates/dkms: No such file or directory
[13:04] <BillyZane|2> i type this in...

[13:06] <Ben64> strange

[13:09] <BillyZane|2> it says 'linux-headers' has no installation candidate
[13:10] <dufa> uragano2: right, I believe /var/log/wtmp is only logged if it exists
[13:11] <uragano2> dufa: and apache log file is deleted everytimes after reboot too. I created wtmp before to reboot

[13:16] <ActionParsnip> BillyZane|2: try:  sudo apt-get --reinstall install dkms
[13:16] <BillyZane|2> is it dpkg -P nvidia-experimental-

[13:33] <mansoor-s> I have a windows laptop and Ubuntu desktop where I do all of my work. But I also want to go to coffee shop :). So, is there a way to "mount" a directory over ssh. Fromwhich I can edit files and it can automatically sync them. and then over ssh console i can compile and run
[13:33] <_DADDY> direction
[13:33] <ikonia> hypopedata: not if you boot into safe graphics
[13:33] <ikonia> _DADDY: ok, what's the question
[13:33] <ikonia> (or issue)
[13:33] <cfhowlett> _DADDY, for mint support ask in the mint channel.
[13:33] <mansoor-s> i'm basically looking for an application tht syncs directory over SSh cross platform
[13:34] <ikonia> cfhowlett: he's not asked for mint support
[13:34] <mansoor-s> hmm
[13:34] <_DADDY> i dont want mint help
[13:34] <ikonia> mansoor-s: rsync ?
[13:34] <niklasfi> mansoor-s: are you looking for sshfs?
[13:34] <Guest99274> mansoor, try scp
[13:34] <cfhowlett> _DADDY, misunderstood then.  sorry.  please continue
[13:34] <mansoor-s> ikonia, niklasfi it should have a client that runs on windows
[13:34] <hypopedata> ikonia: Yes. It tells me it will mount the partitions and then, doing that, freezes-
[13:34] <mansoor-s> ohh
[13:34] <mansoor-s> i might jsut use dropbox
[13:34] <mansoor-s> maybe i'm over thinking this
[13:34] <ikonia> mansoor-s: there is an rsync client for windows
[13:35] <Guest99274> ya dropbox is good
[13:35] <Guest99274> and it uses ssh
[13:35] <niklasfi> mansoor-s: if you are looking for something similar, look at owncloud
[13:35] <mansoor-s> i will
[13:35] <mansoor-s> thanks all
[13:35] <rethus> how can i reconfigure the graphic-card?
[13:35] <mansoor-s> rethus, is it an nvidia?
[13:35] <Guest99274> But many corporate firewalls block ssh :)
[13:35] <rethus> i have copy an image from vbox, but now i have other hardware ... so i need to detect graphic-card and install it
[13:36] <rethus> intel HD2500
[13:36] <BillyZane|2> Ben64:  hi
[13:36] <mansoor-s> Guest99274, one of the tiny perks of being a freelancer :D
[13:36] <ikonia> rethus: xorg is dynamic and should auto detect/configure it
[13:36] <niklasfi> Guest99274: you can always use port 80 or something similar though
[13:36] <ikonia> rethus: unless you have an xorg.conf overriding it/forcing settings
[13:36] <rethus> i try dpkg-reconfivure xserver-x11, but nothein happend
[13:36] <rethus> i have problem, that system freeze periodicaly
[13:37] <ikonia> rethus: please read what I said
=== schmidtm_ is now known as schmidtm
[13:37] <rethus> what u mean with override it? only delete and restart xserver?
[13:38] <_DADDY> just asking about different option besides unity, everytime i try to get a gnome shell going, unity bugs it, do i have to completely remove unity first?
[13:38] <ikonia> rethus: if you have an xorg.conf with options in, it will override the auto detection
[13:38] <ikonia> rethus: if you have no xorg.conf it will autodetect and configure your card
[13:38] <rethus> k. thanks
[13:38] <BillyZane|2> iKonia
[13:38] <ikonia> _DADDY: keeping them seperate is a recommended approach in my view
[13:38] <BillyZane|2> i am stuck at 1024x768
[13:38] <hypopedata> ikonia: Is it possible to return to the recovery mode menu from the root shell?
[13:38] <BillyZane|2> should i create a xorg.conf file?
[13:38] <ikonia> hypopedata: no
[13:38] <crazydip> _DADDY: no you don't... i have both and shell is working ok
[13:39] <_DADDY> just ok?
[13:39] <ikonia> BillyZane|2: what video card do you have......
[13:39] <BillyZane|2> GTX 660
[13:39] <Guest99274> _DADDY : people are generally using gnome2_fallback or either migrating to xfce, unity is really buggy and I too faced the same difficulties
[13:39] <BillyZane|2> i've been trying to get the drivers to work
[13:39] <ikonia> BillyZane|2: then there should already be an xorg.conf forcing it to load the nvidia module
[13:39] <ikonia> Guest99274: please don't make things up
[13:39] <crazydip> _DADDY: what? ok means its working like it should
[13:39] <BillyZane|2> i don't think i have that ikonia
[13:39] <ikonia> Guest99274: "people" are not migrating to xfce
[13:39] <ikonia> BillyZane|2: then there is your problem
[13:40] <BillyZane|2> ok i'll make one
[13:40] <hypopedata> ikonia: Is it then possible to change which commands are executed when booting in recovery mode?
[13:40] <ikonia> BillyZane|2: do you have the nvidia drivers installed
[13:40] <ikonia> hypopedata: no
[13:40] <BillyZane|2> ikonia, i'm new to this but i don't know. it's possible
[13:40] <BillyZane|2> how do i check?
[13:40] <hypopedata> ikonia: Only bad news :(
[13:40] <ikonia> BillyZane|2: did you install them ?

[13:41] <BillyZane|2> i had 2 ppl help me simultaneously, i just did what they told me to do
[13:41] <ikonia> Guest99274: please stop that

[13:42] <ikonia> BillyZane|2: you should not - you've just done the opposite of what I told you
[13:42] <BillyZane|2> hi ben1
[13:42] <BillyZane|2> ben!
[13:42] <ikonia> Ben64: he doesn't believe it is, so over to you

[13:43] <BillyZane|2> ben64: i understand, you should sleep then. i guess it will work itself out some time
[13:43] <BillyZane|2> i should sleep too
[13:43] <Ben64> i have work in 7hrs
[13:43] <BillyZane|2> no problem ben, i appreciate your help
[13:43] <Ben64> maybe disabling the intel would help, nvidia-settings can change resolution and stuff
[13:43] <BillyZane|2> good point, i'll try that
[13:43] <BillyZane|2> brb
[13:43] <Ben64> but the driver is definitely installed at this point
[13:44] <mozzy> ciao
[13:44] <BillyZane|2> how can i check it?
[13:44] <BillyZane|2> like, to see if it's there
[13:44] <Ben64> the driver?
[13:44] <BillyZane|2> then i'll reboot
[13:44] <BillyZane|2> yeah
[13:44] <BillyZane|2> and you sleep

[14:27] <eagernewbie> I am confused by this command for burning an .iso file to a USB drive via terminal... The dd command? I guess I am supposed to fill in the name of the .iso file in the command "dd if=/path/to/file.iso of=/dev/sdb", but I don't know what else I should be filling or what.
[14:27] <Pici> dawkirst: Install the openssh-server package
[14:27] <usr13> hypopedata: YOu are correct in figuring that the problem may be elsewhere, but you can look at the file that holds the passphrase in /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/your-essid-here
[14:27] <xsumi5> I just noticed earphones equipped with the mic and vol controls seem to cause the issue.  I tried a pair from an iPhone, and from a Samsung.

[14:30] <modifier> how to join .001 files in ubuntu ??...i have hjsplit but its not running and i found article stating cat can be used to join such files ?
[14:30] <xsumi5> Thanks anyway guys, I'll try back later.
[14:30] <Zapp83> xsumi5: Ok. My guess, and it is only a guess. Is that when you plug in the headset. it tries to guess what type of device it is. And the jack on your computer is not made for a headset from a phone!
[14:30] <jrib> modifier: just use cat
[14:30] <usr13> hypopedata: And the files are also in the same place
[14:31] <xsumi5> Zapp83: I'll agree it's trying to guess the device, but it's a normal pair of earphones.
[14:31] <modifier> jrib: cat something.filename.extension.xxx.00* > same.filename.same-extension.xxx ??
[14:31] <xsumi5> I may just give in a get a new pair of earbuds
[14:31] <hypopedata> usr13: The password is correct, because it is not a problem logging on in graphics mode. -- In the tutorial, it says "password-flags=1", here the line is "Xauth password-flags=1". Under [vpn-secrets], I have tried to add password=abc, Xauth password=abc, xauth-password=abc, but nothing changes.
[14:31] <jrib> modifier: sure.  as long as  your glob expands to what you want and in the right order
[14:31] <hypopedata> usr13: Yes, the files in the identical place.

[14:33] <hje841> how do I upgrade to g++ 4.7 ?
[14:33] <hypopedata> usr13: I figure the problem must be in this configuration file since I get the error message immediately, and if the program were trying to connect it would take some time as it does in graphics mode.

[14:51] <ActionParsnip> rigo_: when you get the wifi running, run:  sudo lshw -C network

[14:52] <circle> In a virtual box, does it automatically format the space as ext4 (I chose the environment to be an Arch Linux one)? Or do I have to do it myself? I assume the former

[15:01] <modifier> ohh
[15:01] <ActionParsnip> rigo_: the pci slot is moot, ALL slots are scanned using the command
[15:01] <_joey> so?

[15:02] <modifier> so should i proceed with ia32-libs ?

[15:02] <ActionParsnip> rigo_: why do you need to pastebin the output?
[15:02] <modifier> cat is copy utility or joiner ?
[15:02] <ActionParsnip> modifier: it can be both
[15:03] <rigo_> cause u asked for the lshw  -C network
[15:03] <modifier> if copy then can be used as backup utility also like rsync ?
[15:04] <usr13> _joey: If your nick is set to DHCP, it will grab the IP info from the DHCP server of your router and re-write the resolv.conf file.  One thing you might do is change the router configs so that it gives out the nameserver IP you want to use.
[15:04] <ActionParsnip> rigo_: no, I said to run the command, cold boot the OS and unload then reload the driver. I never said to give the output
[15:04] <modifier> and can it copy to disks ? cd dvd etc ?
[15:04] <NET||abuse> slightly off topic, anyone know a good model of 32" monitor for mounting on the wall to show our stats all day, CI build outputs, site traffic etc.. Something with really good power usage.
[15:04] <ActionParsnip> rigo_: scroll up. Try reading whjat I write, rather than what you think I write
[15:04] <MonkeyDust> modifier  i use rsync -a to backup to an external disk
[15:04] <ActionParsnip> modifier: you'll use dd for that
[15:04] <modifier> ok

[15:10] <_joey> it is set to static IP
[15:11] <_joey> but the system changes resolv.conf contents after each reboot
[15:12] <usr13> _joey: Not sure why that would happen, but I suppose you could uninstall network-manager.

[15:15] <BluesKaj> joey open /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head and add your nameservers there because it writes to /etc/resolv.cong ..you can safely ignore the warning and of course as usr13 advises , remove network manager

[15:32] <brecker> hey guys, I'm trying to read two discs that where set up in raid (factory raid of a sony notebook), I've installed dmraid and hooked them up via usb, but it didn't recognized them, if I do dmraid -r it says no discs found, any ideas?
[15:32] <brecker> no raid discs*
[15:33] <usr13> _joey: Sure would be easier if you DID remove it.  :)
[15:34] <bamarni> jhutchins: ok so basically base64 is a binary content encoded so that it gets smaller and can be sent with emails etc right?
[15:34] <meet> does aria2c or axel really speed up downloads?
[15:35] <histo> _joey: is your filesystem writeable and are other files present in /etc

[15:36] <_joey> -rw-r--r--  1 root root for /etc
[15:36] <_joey> histo: I don't have that file
[15:36] <histo> _joey: that's an issue /etc should be a d
[15:36] <ActionParsnip> fego: sup
[15:37] <usr13> _joey: That's interesting.  How did that happen>?
[15:37] <_joey> histo: I did not change anything
[15:37] <histo> _joey: should be drwxr-xr-x on /etc
[15:37] <usr13> _joey: That can not be right because /etc is a directory.
[15:37] <rumpel> _joey, then it must have decided to become a real file ^^
[15:38] <brecker> seen psusi
[15:38] <brecker> !seen psusi
[15:38] <ubottu> I have no seen command
[15:38] <_joey> usr13: some directories under /etc have drwxr-xr-x
[15:38] <usr13> _joey:  ls -l /  |grep etc
[15:39] <_joey> usr13:  I don't think you know what you are talking about
[15:39] <_joey> thanks for your help, though
[15:40] <histo> _joey: etc should be a directory and there should be files present inside of it.
[15:40] <histo> _joey: is this an installed system and what version of ubuntu are you running
[15:40] <_joey> there are files in /etc and /etc is a directory
[15:41] <_joey> Jesus, all I asked is to stop the system upgrading /etc/resolv.conf after reboot :))
[15:41] <_joey> updating rather
[15:41] <histo> _joey: you just have to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkManager#Disabling_NetworkManager
[15:41] <rumpel> _joey, then you gave inexact/false informations: -rw-r--r--  1 root root for /etc    -> it's not a directory
[15:41] <usr13> _joey: And I told you  how to do that.
[15:41] <histo> _joey: but you are having bigger issues if you are saying that /etc is -rw-r--r--
[15:41] <_joey> you are an idiot
[15:41] <histo> _joey: that is not a directory
[15:42] <_joey> if you all your solutions are "remove it"
[15:42] <bazhang> _joey, stop that
[15:42] <_joey> bazhang: he asked for it
[15:42] <_joey> it's not for the first time I told him I am not going to remove it
[15:42] <bazhang> _joey,  thats not right. so just dont do it
[15:42] <adamx> lol got some mad in here
[15:42] <MonkeyDust> _joey  if you want a static IP, first remove network-manager, it's the mot normal way
[15:43] <histo> yeah well usr13 is partially to blame
[15:43] <MonkeyDust> most*
[15:43] <histo> MonkeyDust: he just wants to disable it not remove it
[15:43] <_joey> histo: root@ubuntu:~# stop network-manager
[15:43] <histo> _joey: sudo stop network-manager
[15:43] <_joey> stop: Unknown job: network-manager
[15:43] <MonkeyDust> _joey  great, so no harm done if you remove it
[15:43] <histo> _joey: echo "manual" | sudo tee /etc/init/network-manager.override
[15:44] <_joey> okay  sudo stop network-manager
[15:44] <_joey> stop: Unknown job: network-manager
[15:44] <histo> _joey: okay do the second command please
[15:44] <_joey> as per instructions you linked me to above
[15:44] <histo> _joey: you've already stopped it
[15:45] <histo> _joey: I don't know what else you've tried perhaps you remove the job already.
[15:45] <_joey> what's the name of process in PID table?
[15:45] <jhutchins> _joey: That's not valid linux syntax.
[15:45] <_joey> If I removed it already the system would not be updating resolv.conf after reboots
[15:45] <MonkeyDust> _joey  you're making things way too complicated, IMO, simply remove network-manager, done!
[15:45] <_joey> assuming network-manager has anything to do with updating resolv.conf

[15:49] <BluesKaj> too many cooks
[15:49] <histo> BluesKaj: he doesn't want to remove network-manager just wants to disable it for some reason.

[15:52] <histo> drvanon: that would be my guess.

[15:55] <dcope> what FS does ubuntu support that allows pools of drives? One where i can add drives at will and it just extends the raid?

[16:10] <_joey> you keep asking me about if the network manager is running. I am telling you there is NO!!! network-manager running

[16:12] <everestt> ActionParsnip, won't there be any leftovers still being used somewhere...somehow?
[16:12] <histo> _joey: if you really want to make sure you could just remove the network-manager application. Then there is no way that it could be doing it.

[16:12] <usr13> histo: You guys should move to PM

[16:12] <ActionParsnip> everestt: same with python
[16:13] <histo> usr13: no because I have no other ideas as to what is doing it.
[16:13] <everestt> ActionParsnip, ah! ok ...Thanks a lot :)
[16:13] <histo> usr13: someone else may need to chime in
[16:13] <ActionParsnip> everestt: no worries. I recommend you disable Java in libreoffice if you don't use its functrionality, makes it load faster
[16:13] <usr13> histo: You are correct.  uninstalling network-manager is easy.  (He can always re-install it if he ever wanted to use it again.)
[16:14] <everestt> ActionParsnip, what part of libreoffice specifically uses java?
[16:14] <donttrustem> TomyLobo: I cannot find IA64 in the images
[16:14] <ActionParsnip> everestt: not sure but I use it enough and i've not seen an issue in all the time I've used it
[16:15] <everestt> ActionParsnip, libreoffice-java-common isn't installed in my system... is that the file?
[16:15] <usr13> histo: If one has trouble controlling an application, removing it is the easy solution.

[16:22] <_helios_> pijush, did you try sudo apt-get update --fix -missing
[16:22] <pijush> terminal not working any more
[16:22] <_joey> histo: mate, it is still not working. What is the command to remove the network manager?

[16:23] <usr13> pijush: What did you do?  Was it  do-release-upgrade  ?
[16:23] <_joey> histo: network-manager is NOT installed. It was not installed on my system.

[16:25] <_joey> histo: ubuntu 12.10
[16:25] <ogra_> _joey, sudo apt-get remove resolvconf
[16:25] <histo> _joey: is this a desktoptop system?
[16:25] <_joey> another recommendation of removing
[16:25] <ogra_> (and make sure to have proper entries in your /etc/resolv.conf)
[16:26] <histo> ogra_: what?
[16:26] <_joey> ogra_: i think this may do the trick
[16:26] <ogra_> _joey, /etc/resolv.conf pretty prominently says what is used to update it at the top comment of that file
[16:26] <_joey> ogra_: the system also wants to remove ubuntu-minimal
[16:27] <_joey> what's ubuntu-minimal?
[16:27] <ogra_> yes, since resolvconf is a default app
[16:27] <ogra_> its a meta package like i.e. ubuntu-desktop
[16:28] <_joey> ogra_: thanks. I am pretty damn reading comments about network-manager in this room while not reading what's in /etc/resolv.conf

[16:28] <llutz> add you nameserver entries to /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head  and don't remove resolvconf, done
[16:28] <ogra_> yeah, llutz surely has a more proper solution
[16:28] <histo> _joey: you can sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolvconf
[16:28] <_joey> ogra_: if ubuntu-minimal is removed, the system will not be broken?
[16:28] <ogra_> mine was rather the sledgehammer one
[16:29] <histo> _joey: and stop it from dynamically updating. Although I don't know how it is
[16:29] <ogra_> _joey, nope
[16:29] <histo> _joey: especially since network-manager is removed.
[16:29] <jarlath> Does anyone know how to run nautilus as a different user? Tried gksudo but it's asking for a password and the account in question has none.

[16:30] <histo> ogra_: when did this behavior start?
[16:30] <ogra_> 12.04 i think
[16:30] <usr13> jarlath: What exactly are you needing to do?

[16:31] <NaGeL> hello. I havea problem with my ubuntu. i installed it on an old computer. andi use ethernet to cnnect it to my router. now my router gives it az IP throught DHCP. a reserved one. this is fine, but wheni start up the PC ubuntu getsa total random IP that doesnt work at all. Butwhen i click on disconect wired network and reconnect it it magically works
[16:32] <joey_> problem is solved
[16:32] <usr13> jarlath: Maybe you should just change ownership of the files. Or, remount it rw
[16:32] <joey_> llutz: solution worked perfectly
[16:32] <histo> ogra_: If my understanding of the resolvconf package is correct he would only experience that if he is using dhcp
[16:32] <llutz> joey_: thats what resolvconf is for

[16:34] <usr13> jarlath: Just remember that you'll need to log out and back in again before having the benifit of those changes.
[16:34] <jarlath> usr13: thanks.
[16:35] <compdoc> clad, happens sometimes. Might be best to use the Ubuntu driver
[16:35] <clad> Right click still work and by clicking "change the background image" then "all setting" I can get back to the software center and select back the open source driver

[16:55] <pijush> samsung don't offer any support for ubuntu
[16:55] <usr13> pijush: What do you mean by the screen getting burn?
[16:56] <cousteau> google seems to suggest   mount -o remount,rw /
[16:56] <drPoo> Tex_Nick, I was looking at examples that use the following method: 1) create a script and store it in /etc/init.d then run "sudo update-rc.d myscript defaults 98 02"
[16:56] <pijush> screen get white
[16:56] <Tex_Nick> drPoo : no ... create your script somewhere ... then symlink to it
[16:56] <usr13> drPoo: What does your script do?
[16:56] <pijush> slowly slowly
[16:57] <drPoo> usr13, it starts custom programs that are to run in the backgroupd
[16:57] <usr13> drPoo: You could just put it in /etc/rc.local
[16:57] <cousteau> ok, I'll assume `mount -o remount,rw /` is the way to go, and try to memorize that command
[16:58] <drPoo> usr13, I did not understand how am i to incorporate my commands into /etc/rc.local, do i simply add them to that file?

[17:29] <MonkeyDust> circle  on top of
[17:29] <circle> MonkeyDust: ok, and a DE like XFCE, will that come with a window manager
[17:30] <ogra_> window managers are usually a part of the desktop env
[17:30] <circle> so just installing a DE is ok?
[17:30] <ogra_> they "manage windows" (draw frames, and window buttons etc)
[17:30] <ogra_> yes, normally that should be ok ... ubuntu usually has *-desktop metapackages for installing a DE
[17:31] <cousteau> circle, I think it goes like this:    X11 server  {  display manager  {  desktop environment  {  shell (sometimes)  {  window manager  {  window decorator
[17:31] <ogra_> i.e. if you want xfce you install xubuntu-desktop

[17:38] <scarra3> I have been thinking about making the switch from Windows 7 to Ubuntu 12.10 but I heard there are installation problems where people have to repair something in the boot process
=== chiluk is now known as chiluk_away
[17:38] <Ankit> who should reply
[17:39] <Ankit> anyone
[17:39] <MonkeyDust> scarra3  it's the grub, you have to repair it, if you installed ubuntu first
[17:39] <cousteau> Ankit, well, maybe nobody knows the answer
[17:39] <cousteau> or didn't understand the question
[17:39] <scarra3> MonkeyDust: I havent installed it yet but will I get the install problem?

[17:43] <bennett1> Hi! I am trying to understand here the /etc/shadow file. Are the passwords stored as a MD5 hash? I've read that they are, but I tried converting my own password to md5 and comparing it to the one in the shadow file, and they are different
[17:43] <bennett1> anyone knows why?
[17:43] <dcherniv> bennett1, its not md5, pbbly blowfish or somehing stronger
[17:44] <SonikkuAmerica> Good to be back in Ubuntu again!
[17:44] <bennett1> dcherniv: hm, any idea on where to find that info?
[17:44] <histo> bennett1: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lame/LAME/linux-admin-made-easy/shadow-file-formats.html
[17:45] <cousteau> bennett1, maybe man shadow
[17:45] <bennett1> man shadow doesn't say the algorithm
[17:45] <bennett1> histo: taking a look, thanks
[17:46] <bennett1> histo: doens't say the algorithm either
[17:47] <cousteau> bennett1, I think it might be crypt()
[17:47] <cousteau> man 3 crypt
[17:47] <cousteau> not sure, though
[17:48] <histo> bennett1: did you look at man shadow?
[17:48] <bennett1> cousteau: yeah, man crypt has the info
[17:48] <histo> bennett1: crypt DES probably salted also
[17:48] <bennett1> histo: yes, it doenst contain info on the algorithm
[17:49] <bennett1> it''s SHA-512
[17:49] <bennett1> whatever that is
[17:49] <cousteau> bennett1, not sure if it's crypt what shadow uses, but I think it is
[17:49] <SonikkuAmerica> SHA-512 is an algorithm for verifying checksums
[17:49] <cousteau> SHA-512 is a 512-bit SHA algorithm
[17:49] <histo> cousteau: I think you can use multiple formats with crypt
[17:49] <SonikkuAmerica> In the tradition of MD5, SHA-1 and SHA-256
[17:49] <cousteau> like SHA1
[17:50] <cousteau> (SHA1 uis 160 bits, MD5 is 128 bits)
[17:50] <SonikkuAmerica> cousteau: Correct
[17:50] <bennett1> man shadow cites man 3 crypt
[17:50] <bennett1> and the password is preceeded by a $6$
[17:50] <bennett1> indicating it is SHA-512
[17:50] <histo> cousteau: crypt can do md5 blowfish sha-256 sha-512 according the the man page
[17:50] <SonikkuAmerica> And, of course, typically the more bits an encrypt algorithm is, the more secure it is
[17:50] <SonikkuAmerica> *the 1st is = has
[17:50] <bennett1> SonikkuAmerica: what is a checksum?
[17:51] <cousteau> bennett1, those passwords are like   $<algo>$<salt>$<encrypted_password>
[17:52] <SonikkuAmerica> bennett1: I hate to be lazy but: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum
[17:52] <SonikkuAmerica> Or rather: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum
[17:52] <bennett1> SonikkuAmerica: it's ok, I'm reading it :P
[17:52] <histo> bennett1: what are you trying to crack it with?
[17:52] <cousteau> for example, $5$abc$defghij means 5=SHA512, salt = abc, password = defghij (encrypted)
[17:53]  * cousteau leaves
[17:53] <Tex_Nick> SonikkuAmerica : wikipedia isn't lazy ... tis a good resource :-)
[17:53] <bennett1> histo: right now I'm just trying to understand the file
[17:53] <SonikkuAmerica> Tex_Nick: True, but I was being lazy.
[17:53] <histo> bennett1: here's a cracking tutorial
[17:53] <bennett1> well, happy to know that it is something safer than md5
[17:53] <Tex_Nick> understood :)
[17:55] <histo> bennett1: well not really safe but thank god it's salted
[17:55] <SonikkuAmerica> Well then what's $6$ at the beginning if $5$ is SHA-512?
[17:56] <bennett1> SonikkuAmerica: $5$ is SHA-256, according to man 3 crypt
[17:56] <SonikkuAmerica> [12:52] <cousteau> for example, $5$abc$defghij means 5=SHA512, salt = abc, password = defghij (encrypted) <<< then cousteau messed this line up

[17:57] <bennett1> histo: I didn't understand
[17:57] <bennett1> (sorry, my english is not that great)
[17:57] <histo> bennett1: how did you come up with the second column is salt?
[17:58] <bennett1> what do you mean? It says in the man 3 crypt that the second column is salt
[17:59] <sathish> Hi guys, for some reason my laptop is always booting in to Unity 2D :( nVIDIA 610M card, Installed nvidia-current followed instructions from forums, no luck. What should I do?
[17:59] <ActionParsnip> sathish: what CPU do you use?
[18:00] <sathish> ActionParsnip: core i3 second gen

[18:00] <ActionParsnip> sathish: is the system a laptop too?
[18:01] <SonikkuAmerica> cousteau: How could (in the example noted above) the string "abc" be put into <salt>? It says that <salt> is a TWO-character string
[18:01] <SonikkuAmerica> (in the manpage)
[18:01] <ActionParsnip> sathish: you have a switchable GPU (optimus)

[18:03] <Sail>  /exit
[18:03] <bennett1> about MD5 hashes: do they contain special characters, or just a-z and 0-9?
[18:03] <ActionParsnip> sathish: oesn't the wiki not mention nvidia-current
[18:03] <bennett1> and they are case insensitive, right?
[18:03] <ActionParsnip> SonikkuAmerica: I think its a dirty hack, not worth the heartache
[18:03] <histo> bennett1: yeah I don't think that the second field is the salt
[18:03] <ActionParsnip> bennett1: all alphanumeric
[18:03] <sathish> ActionParsnip: is there anyhot key to switch between different graphic cards? I know this is a stupid question, but my neighbour kid was handling keyboard like crazy :|

[18:35] <cocomo> usr13: am doing exactly that, downloading 12.04
[18:35] <usr13> cocomo: LTS is good.
[18:35] <cocomo> usr13: is there a way keep my installed packages?
[18:36] <usr13> cocomo: No
[18:36] <blkadder> bencc: Well assuming you are using Apache, it has the ability to control resource utilization.
[18:36] <ophuk> also the file i'm trying to execute has the permissions of 777
[18:36]  * cocomo regrets the day when he clicked the upgrade button
[18:37] <llutz> ophuk: is it mounted with "noexec" or "user" option?
[18:37] <usr13> ophuk: So, what command are you trying execute?
[18:37] <blkadder> But that doesn't help mitigate the potential security issues with allowing people to compile and execute random code on your server.
[18:37] <cocomo> usr13: is there any bootable usb installer for ubuntu that i can run from ubuntu
[18:37] <ophuk> usr13: ./test.sh, test.sh is a bash script that does pwd.
[18:38] <ophuk> llutz: umm...not sure how do I check that?
[18:38] <llutz> ophuk: "mount"
[18:38] <usr13> cocomo: There is a bootable USB installer that you can boot to.
[18:38] <BluesKaj> cocomo, you reteive you package settings during an upgrade by using a / partition for the OS  and /home partition for your data ..remember that option the next time you upgrade
[18:38] <ActionParsnip> cocomo: like unetbootin you mean?
[18:38] <usr13> ophuk: ls -l test.sh    #Show us.
[18:38] <ophuk> llutz: it is mounted with noexec, how do I take taht off
[18:38] <cocomo> ActionParsnip: yes
[18:39] <llutz> ophuk: sudo mount -o remount,exec /mountpoint
[18:39] <ophuk> usr13: -rwxrwxrwx 1 srinivasan root 15 Jan 14 13:24 test.sh
[18:39] <tion> what does xdiagnose do because i click it and nothing happends
[18:39] <usr13> ophuk: pastebinit test.sh   #Send resulting URL.
[18:39] <ophuk> llutz: easy enough. Thanks! Is noexec the default?
[18:39] <llutz> ophuk: depends on the filesystem, on non-unix-fs it is afaik
[18:40] <usr13> ophuk: Did you try   sh test.sh    ?
[18:40] <ophuk> llutz: it's ext4
[18:40] <ophuk> usr13: I think we figured it out
[18:40] <cocomo> ActionParsnip: ty
[18:40] <usr13> ophuk: Ok.  Cool

=== rosgani is now known as rosgani_0n_Linux
=== nisio_ is now known as nisio
[18:43] <usr13> DexterF: You have a NIC to use for it?
[18:43] <DexterF> usr13: yes. it's already running, but I need it to use a different address
[18:44] <usr13> DexterF: Well, how ever you configured it, just start over and choose new IPs.
[18:44] <ActionParsnip> DexterF: you will need 2 devices, on e to get the connection and one to share it
[18:45] <usr13> ActionParsnip: He says he's already got that part done.
[18:45] <ActionParsnip> DexterF: you will need to set the sharing interface to static IP using the network manager, as there will be no DHCP service around
[18:45] <ActionParsnip> usr13: thanks
[18:46] <ActionParsnip> DexterF: inter the interface, set the interface to manual and you can define the networking there
[18:46] <DexterF> ill check that...
[18:46] <usr13> DexterF: Did you use IP Masquerading?
[18:47] <usr13> DexterF: Never mind.  I think you've got it now.
[18:48] <kslater> why does the stupid update manager insist that I take a security update for portugeses, chinese and catalan spanish for Firefox? I don't want and don't use any of those languages.
[18:48] <donavan01> Is there a way setup ubuntu on a flash drive install all the stuff I want on the drive and then copy that drive to serveral other identical drives so that each one of them can boot and run just like the orginal?
[18:48] <DexterF> nah, doesnt work
[18:48] <usr13> kslater: Uninstall them.
[18:48] <DexterF> once I go for "shared" it discards any manual settings
[18:48] <Bsims> kslater: I'll bet you have the lion packages for firefox installed
[18:48] <kslater> yeah. I'll have to
[18:49] <usr13> DexterF: You are not sharing that one.
[18:49] <NuSuey> question: I got ati radeon HD 6850.. in windows, the integrated card works (have HDMI output in it) .. but in ubuntu, I cannot see its video output  .. any suggestions?
[18:49] <jimi_> Can anyone recommend a pdf to html converter, that will keep form fields ?
[18:49] <Bsims> donavan01: yeah set the flash to boot persistant until you have the packages you want installed then copy the thumbdrive to another one
[18:50] <NuSuey> its this PC  http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02741889&tmp_task=prodinfoCategory&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en&product=5068976#N281
[18:50] <DexterF> usr13: fact that this machine connects to it and thus to the internet proves different
[18:50] <usr13> DexterF: ifconfig | pastebinit
[18:50] <Bsims> donavan01: you may try using dd to make an iso of the flashdrive
[18:51] <donavan01> Bsims ... yeah I guess and ISO would work hadnt thought about that
[18:51] <usr13> DexterF: Do you have a firewall script?
[18:51] <kslater> of course now it says it needs a reboot to finish the update. Not happening you stinking machine.
[18:51] <Bsims> donavan01: I'd use lili to burn the usb drive, its very slick and even will install and configure portable virtualbox to use the cd image
[18:51] <donavan01> one other question ... does ubuntu store the most common drivers on the live discs or are they something that needs to be downloaded
[18:52] <Bsims> donavan01: its on the live disks
[18:52] <ActionParsnip> jimi_: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-convert-pdf-files-to-html-files.html
[18:52] <donavan01> Good deal Bsims ... thats for the info

[18:54] <odo2063> hi
[18:54] <odo2063> my /dev/rfcomm* are gone and i dont know where they went!
[18:54] <usr13> DexterF: So eth0 is the one that is connected to the Internet.  Right?
[18:54] <odo2063> 11.10
[18:54] <DexterF> usr13: isp went down, intermediate solution: laptop with umts card connects to internet, shares eth0 to network. only uses 10.42.0.0/24
[18:55] <ActionParsnip> odo2063: oneiric is EOL in April, I recommend you upgrade soon
[18:55] <odo2063> ActionParsnip,  me dont becaue of qucs
[18:55] <jimi_> ActionParsnip: all you get is ">Warning: This form is not supported with the current version of Acrobat or Adobe Reader.<br/> Upgrade to the latest version for full support"
[18:55] <ActionParsnip> odo2063: if you boot an older kernel, is it ok?
[18:55] <ActionParsnip> odo2063: what is 'qucs'' please?
[18:55] <usr13> DexterF: So, I got it backwards.  hso0  is the internet connection.  Right?
[18:56] <jhutchins> DexterF: The answer to your question is that you configure the connection that links to the rest of the local machines to use an address and netmask on that network.
[18:56] <ActionParsnip> jimi_: what app are you viewing the file with?
[18:56] <odo2063> ActionParsnip,  http://qucs.sourceforge.net/    it have problems kompiling with newer gcc
[18:56] <jimi_> ActionParsnip: im not viewing it, that is using pdftohtml.... that's in the html
[18:56] <odo2063> it has
[18:56] <ActionParsnip> odo2063: i see
[18:56] <jhutchins> DexterF: The answer to what you want to do probably has very little to do with network-manager and everything to do with ipmasquerade or NAT and iptables forwarding.
[18:57] <|Anthony|> I'm having serious issue trying to interact with flash based sites. Videos on youtube just don't work and plugin-container crashes
[18:57] <ActionParsnip> jimi_: gotcha
[18:57] <odo2063> ActionParsnip, what if it works with an oldr kernel?
[18:57] <|Anthony|> what are we supposed to use now that adobe no longer supports linux
[18:57] <jimi_> ActionParsnip: I was trying to take a pdf that has fields you can type it, and convert it to html ... so i could just put it on a website easier :P
[18:57] <ActionParsnip> |Anthony|: what is the output of: lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | egrep 'flash|gnash|swf|spark'
[18:58] <ActionParsnip> odo2063: then there  is a bug with the newer kernel

[18:58] <|Anthony|> ActionParsnip, http://pastebin.com/rpnpheuh
[18:58] <DexterF> jhutchins: one cannot conf the if from nwm. I think nwm runs its own mini dhcp with fixed values. so boils down to: setup conn sharing manually. I guess rebooting my servers to have them lease a new IP is easier.
[18:58] <odo2063> ActionParsnip,  can we do something about it? except using the old kernel?
[18:58] <usr13> DexterF: So you are attempting to share hso0  via eth0    Right?
[18:59] <DexterF> usr13: yup
[18:59] <DexterF> see above tho
[18:59] <ActionParsnip> odo2063: thatall I can advise personally

[19:00] <DexterF> usr13: already there....
[19:00] <|Anthony|> and replace it with what ActionParsnip
[19:00] <ActionParsnip> DexterF: then enable the partner repo and install adobe-flashplugin
[19:00] <usr13> DexterF: Ok, what's hangin you up?
[19:01] <DexterF> ActionParsnip: nuh uh! ;)
[19:01] <|Anthony|> ActionParsnip, i'm assuming that was at me. which partner repo?
[19:01] <ActionParsnip> DexterF: it will give you 64bit flash for 64bit OS
[19:02] <ActionParsnip> |Anthony|: the partner repo, you can use software centre, or you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list and enagble it that way, same difference
[19:02] <DexterF> ActionParsnip: but I already have 64bit flash :)
[19:02] <Tex_Nick> ActionParsnip : a bit ago i saw that you're using Raring ... i'm downloading iso now ... how is that working for you ... stable enough to replace 12.10 ... 12.10 is working great for me, however i kinda like to tip-toe on the razors edge :-)
[19:02] <iceroot> ActionParsnip: on 12.04 multiverse contains flash
[19:03] <iceroot> ActionParsnip: or did i get the conversation wrong?

[19:07] <usr13> DexterF: I don't know how to do it from a LiveDVD  Sorry.
[19:08] <NuSuey> any suggestion would be helpfull..
[19:08] <DexterF> usr13: well, could install ufw and conf it and all, but just too much effort. thanks for the time anyway
[19:08] <usr13> DexterF: Now, wait.  Is the system runing from a LiveDVD the one that is connected to the Internet?
[19:08] <DexterF> usr13: uh huh
[19:08] <Tex_Nick> NuSuey : strange that 4GB of RAM is overflowing ... you might need to increase your swap
[19:08] <VaultDweller13> hi people, could smbd help with configuring dhcp server with 2 NICs?
[19:09] <NuSuey> Tex_Nick: swap is like have it ~ 4.8GB
[19:09] <usr13> DexterF: Yea, ok.. Well.  I suppose you could do it, bit I can't.  (Not from here anyway.)
[19:09] <NuSuey> Tex_Nick: meh, missclicked.. so.. ~ swap partition is ~  4.8gb

[19:25] <VaultDweller13> blkadder: i saw that, the question is interfaces config
[19:25] <compdoc> VaultDweller13, you have network manager running? or are you editing /etc/netowork/interfaces?
[19:26] <compdoc> *network
[19:26] <VaultDweller13> compdoc: second
[19:26] <blkadder> VaultDweller13: So what specifically are you having an issue with?
[19:26] <blkadder> You say you are losing a NIC? What do you mean by that?
[19:27] <compdoc> VaultDweller13, do you ever check your /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules   ? Unfortunately, that file changes when one nic is ready at boot, and the others arent ready
[19:27] <VaultDweller13> blkadder: dhcp doesnt get through it..for some reason
[19:27] <VaultDweller13> compdoc: yes, i did
[19:27] <blkadder> So it is not offering leases?
[19:27] <VaultDweller13> blkadder: yeap..
[19:28] <blkadder> And is the NIC active/up?
[19:28] <compdoc> VaultDweller13, you can define your own udev rules so it never changes
=== rar_rar is now known as rar_rar_AFK
[19:29] <VaultDweller13> compdoc: i did that) but problem is that dhcp doesnt give leases to both NICs, only on one or other

=== yann__ is now known as Yann_L1
[19:29] <blkadder> Are the NICs on the same subnet or different ones?
[19:29] <VaultDweller13> blkadder: yes, and IP is correct
[19:29] <compdoc> VaultDweller13, can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces   and /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules   ?

[19:36] <orudie> hi. how do I get to the keyboard shortcuts screen ?
[19:37] <orudie> its an overview of keyboard shortctus, I remember seeing it somewhere but i forgot how I got to it
[19:37] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: sup
[19:37] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: are you up for a non-working sound card?
[19:37] <ActionParsnip> Orudie: hold windows key down
[19:38] <ActionParsnip> Billy zane|2: my sound trouble shooting is poor at best
[19:38] <BillyZane|2> it's a tough one
[19:39] <morfeo_81> Another thing..iF I WRITE SOMINTHING ON THE BASH WITH "T" i DON'T SEE T BUT ONLY J
[19:40] <awesomess3> Does anyone know of a good free web hosting solution?
[19:40] <orudie> ActionParsnip: can't seem to find a shortcut to switch between keyboard languages
[19:41] <Guest18166> chi
[19:43] <orudie> what is a keyboard shortcut to switch between languages in ubuntu ?
[19:45] <angs> how can I see if a file is executable or not?
[19:47] <llutz> angs: "test -x yourfile && echo executable" or "ls -l yourfile" and check for --x
[19:47] <ActionParsnip> Orudie: I believe you can set it in keyboard settings
[19:48] <ActionParsnip> Morfeo_81: lose the caps please
[19:48] <ernest_> hi everyone
[19:48] <angs> llutz: I do chmod +x to a file however I don't see --x http://pastebin.com/b3x7Qjyh . am I doing something wrong?
[19:49] <llutz> angs: thats a non-unix filesystem? you cannot chown/chmod then
[19:50] <ernest_> i need a little help please
[19:50] <awesomess3> ernest_, what do you need?
[19:50] <angs> llutz: it is fat32. do I need to make it ext2?
[19:50] <BillyZane|2> ActionParsnip: omg, my video card really does have drivers. my outbound sound is set to HDMI,
[19:50] <llutz> angs: what do you want to do exactly?
[19:51] <angs> llutz: I want to make the file executable.
[19:51] <ernest_> I upgraded my system to the latest x32 of ubuntu, when i put my driver cd that came with my biostar A880g+ it wont boot to install the drivers so i can run my HDMI port
[19:51] <ActionParsnip> Angs: are you using gubuntu?
[19:51] <tion> soft center is slow as hell and crashes
[19:51] <angs> no it is ubuntu 12.10 just I renamed as gubuntu
[19:52] <dr_willis> angs:  theres options you can give when you mount a fat32 fs to make EVERY file show up as executable..  if you need this for wine. i find it easier to just use the cli and do a 'wine /path/to/whatever.exe'
[19:52] <awesomess3> erncic, are you sure the driver CD is compatible with ubuntu?
[19:52] <NuSuey> ah, something non-general to ubuntu, but what could could I use in ubuntu to denoise video? :/
[19:52] <dr_willis> I really dont see the whole point of exe files being executable in order for that wine launcher to work.  there may be some other work arounds
[19:53] <ernest_> when i installed oneiric before on this MB im almost sure i used this driver CD and it booted
[19:53] <ernest_> the files are windows tho. They are .exe. but like i said it booted before for what i remember
[19:55] <angs> dr_willis: thank you. how can I make only one file executable? or is it easier to change fat32 to ext2?
[19:56] <dr_willis> angs:  easies is to use the cli.
[19:56] <ActionParsnip> Angs: you can mount the whole file system executable and be ok
[19:56] <dr_willis> angs:  converting just for wine.. is a little.. overkill
[19:56] <dr_willis> the askubuntu.com site might have some other work arounds that i dont know about also angs
[19:57] <angs> dr_willis, ActionParsnip: thank you
[19:57] <dr_willis> for some reason the .exe files are assoicated with a wine 'preloader binary tool'  for security reasns it insists they be executable..
[19:57] <dr_willis> even tho they are really not 'linux excutables'
[19:57] <dr_willis> seems to be to be a very bad way to put some security on somthing
[19:57] <ActionParsnip> Dr_willis: its tiring
[19:58] <dr_willis> but i never launch .exe's via double clicking on them anyway.
[19:58] <ernest_> Since i cant use the driver CD that came with my Biostar A880G+ since it seems its for windows only. How do I go about getting the drivers I need?
[19:59] <dr_willis> ernest_:  drivers for what devices ?
[19:59] <ernest_> I cant use my HDMI port, i put mirror and my tv doesnt display anything

[19:59] <dr_willis> ernest_:  and your video chipset is?
[20:00] <ernest_> give me a second
[20:02] <kale> what was the default wm in 10.04LTS? how do i get that in 12.04LTS?
[20:03] <awesomess3> kale, I believe it's gnome
[20:03] <dkim1987> hey guys
[20:03] <dr_willis> kale:  gnome2 is basically dead. theres a fallback mode thats similer but NOT identical in 12+
[20:03] <dkim1987> is it possible to setup access to nfs using rsa key?
[20:03] <awesomess3> kale, try `apt-cache search gnome | sort | grep gnome`
[20:03] <ernest_> dr_willis its an ati radeon
[20:04] <MonkeyDust> dkim1987 rsa key is for ssh, not for nfs, i guess
[20:04] <dkim1987> i see
[20:04] <Bsims> I am looking to backup my running system to a compressed iso... with the intention of using a usb live installer to make it a live usb device... any suggestions?
[20:04] <dkim1987> i'm looking for a way to authorize nfs access much like rsa key style
[20:04] <MonkeyDust> dkim1987  nfs is for mounting remote drives locally
[20:04] <dkim1987> yes
[20:04] <kale> dr_willis: and gnome is gnome3?
[20:04] <dkim1987> and nfs server has hosts.allow, hosts.deny, and exports file that determines the access
[20:04] <disharmonic> Cinnamon is quite similar to Gnome 2 imo
=== Guest80321 is now known as pabst^
[20:05] <MonkeyDust> dkim1987  ubuntu server?
[20:05] <dkim1987> centos and ubuntu
[20:05] <dkim1987> but centos channel is kinda dead, so i decided to start here
[20:05] <Slart> dkim1987: last time I checked into this one of the flaws of nfs was the rather weak security protocols.. it might have changed since then or I might have been bad at reading
[20:05] <roll> hi all, I have a strange error in Ubuntu: I can resolve internet hostname only in Firefox and with ping, as root. I can use other software, have you got any idea?
[20:05] <dkim1987> nfs still sucks with security
[20:05] <KRISTENBB_> my icons on the left are not visible anymore. How to restart the unity bar on the left without restarting ubuntu ? I tried 'alt+f2' and 'unity', but it's still the same.
[20:05] <roll> *can't use
[20:06] <dkim1987> i am using chef and all the chef node will have to access a nfs system we have
[20:06] <MonkeyDust> KRISTENBB_  try unity --restart
[20:06] <dkim1987> but i dont want to allow everyone either
[20:06] <Loshki> dkim1987: check out http://www.math.ualberta.ca/imaging/snfs/ and the like...
[20:06] <Bsims> kale: Id go with either mint or xfce if you want a light dm
[20:06] <dkim1987> k i'll read it now
[20:06] <kale> Bsims: i just want something a regular windows user would understand
=== Catbuntu is now known as NancyS
[20:06] <histo> kale: it was gnome2
[20:07] <dkim1987> thanks
[20:07] <KRISTENBB_> MonkeyDust: it's worse than just 'unity', it doesn't even reload the windows. It just doesn't do anything.
[20:07] <Bsims> kale: xfce is very similar to windows xp
[20:07] <kale> Bsims: indeed
[20:07] <ActionParsnip> Roll: try:   echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf
[20:07] <histo> kale: I would look at some screen shots of xfce, lxde, mint all are kind of menu driven
[20:07] <ActionParsnip> Roll: then yry web access
[20:07] <histo> kale: most windows users are okay with 12.04 just tell them to hit the windows key
[20:08] <MonkeyDust> KRISTENBB_  then you should start giving details, from the beginning and in one line
[20:08] <Slart> dkim1987: this article looks interesting.. it mentions a new authentication scheme for nfs v4 http://www.centos.org/docs/5/html/Deployment_Guide-en-US/s1-nfs-security.html
[20:08] <ActionParsnip> Kale: kde is a lot like windows. It's not light though
[20:09] <KRISTENBB_> What details are you interested in ? I'm running ubuntu 12.04 desktop. I don't know what caused this, I didn't do anything extraordinary.
[20:09] <kale> ActionParsnip: i think kde is too slow
[20:09] <KRISTENBB_> MonkeyDust: ^
[20:09] <Bsims> ActionParsnip: heh I've had windows users ask me what version of windows I was running as kde looked so slick
[20:09] <kale> i'll go try out the gnome meta package
[20:09] <MonkeyDust> !details | KRISTENBB_ this is what we mean by details
[20:09] <ubottu> KRISTENBB_ this is what we mean by details: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[20:09] <roll> ActionParsnip: you mean I should disconnect and than reconnect?
[20:09] <ActionParsnip> Kale: lxde is light
[20:09] <OerHeks> Bsims same here
[20:09] <roll> ActionParsnip: after the writing file
[20:10] <ActionParsnip> Roll: just run the command then try web access
[20:10] <Bsims> OerHeks: I've gotten windows 7 rather close, but havnt found anything like the folder view plasmoid
[20:10] <roll> ActionParsnip: if i try ping in another terminal session, still doesn't work
[20:10] <ActionParsnip> Bsims: yeah. Windows is the only OS :)
[20:11] <roll> firefox goes
[20:11] <KRISTENBB_> MonkeyDust: I have a problem with the unity icon bar on the left. I'm running ubuntu version 12.04. When I try to do 'alt+f2' and 'unity' I get the following result: the windows reload, but I expected it to solve my problem and show the icons on the left.
[20:11] <roll> ActionParsnip: very strange :O
[20:11] <dodo3773> roll: You are being told to try a different nameserver that's all. That's what /etc/resolv.conf does (resolves host names to ip addresses)
[20:11] <roll> ActionParsnip, dodo3773: I tryed even open dns
[20:11] <ActionParsnip> Roll: do you mean Firefox fails connection?
[20:11] <roll> firefox works
[20:12] <Bsims> ActionParsnip: heh I'm typing this in a Debian Testing VM on windows 7
[20:12] <dodo3773> roll: 8.8.8.8 is google dns
[20:12] <roll> but anything else doesn't work
[20:12] <histo> roll: what "other" software are you trying to use that has hostname issues?
[20:12] <MonkeyDust> KRISTENBB_  can you logout and back in?
[20:12] <ActionParsnip> Roll: do you use a proxy?
[20:12] <DredTiger> I'm running raring on a macbookpro. When I connect to my company VPN, DNS resolution for things outside the company domain fails.
[20:12] <roll> xchat, ping
[20:12] <Noskcaj> kale, you want either lxde(lubuntu) or xfce(xubuntu)
[20:12] <histo> roll: I thought you said you could ping hostnames
=== dpac is now known as dpac|away
[20:12] <dodo3773> roll: go into your networkmanager settings and make sure that proxy is unchecked and turn off ipv6 maybe and save and try it again
[20:12] <roll> no, I'm not
[20:12] <roll> histo, nope
[20:13] <histo> roll: how are you launching firefox/
[20:13] <DredTiger> I've been poking around the internet and see how network-manager uses dnsmasq
[20:13] <KRISTENBB_> MonkeyDust: no that's highly unconvienent, I'd much rather just solve my unity issue without doing that. Though I know it would must likely solve my issue.
[20:13] <k1l> DredTiger: raring support is in #ubuntu+1 as its not released yet
[20:13] <ActionParsnip> Bsims: I've ran Xpud a lot.  People asking me what it was. Fun
[20:13] <Bsims> heh that one Ive got to google
[20:13] <dodo3773> roll: Do you use a firewall?
[20:13] <DredTiger> k1l: Sorry, I forgot. Thnx. I'll hop over there.
[20:13] <ActionParsnip> Roll: does apt-get work ok?
[20:14] <Bsims> heh that looks neat ActionParsnip
[20:14] <MonkeyDust> KRISTENBB_  repeat your question every 10 minutes or so, i'm sure someone else can help you - do try logging, tho
[20:14] <roll> yes, it does, I used Ubuntu software center to install xchat
[20:14] <ActionParsnip> Roll: can you ping the router's internal ip?
[20:15] <roll> I don't have the router, I'm using a mobile internet key
=== Keroz is now known as SweetBrown
[20:15] <ActionParsnip> Bsims: great for thin clients. Boots in seconds
[20:15] <histo> roll: can you ping external ips? like try ping 8.8.8.8
[20:15] <vl4kn0> gnome-terminal only offers me monospaced fonts. I have a font that even it is monospace, it is not available to select. How do I fix this behaviour?
[20:15]  * Bsims will keep it in mind
[20:15] <Bsims> brb
[20:15] <roll> histo: yes i can, server response
[20:16] <ActionParsnip> Roll: I bet your provider is blocking icmp
[20:16] <roll> uhm maybe
[20:16] <roll> but xchat uses icmp?
[20:16] <ActionParsnip> Vl4kn0: can you select the font in other applications
[20:17] <ActionParsnip> Roll: I'd think not
[20:17] <ActionParsnip> Roll: tried other irc clients?
[20:17] <KRISTENBB_> MonkeyDust: what's the official name for the icon bar on the left ?
[20:17] <dodo3773> roll: I don't think xchat used icmp. Pretty sure it uses a dynamic port
[20:17] <roll> emphaty IM, doesn't work
[20:18] <vl4kn0> ActionParsnip: yes I can. Only gnome-terminal makes a big deal out of it
[20:18] <roll> the port is 9999 (SSL)
[20:19] <ActionParsnip> Vl4kn0: if you use terminal alot I can recommend guake
[20:19] <dodo3773> roll: Does dig work? -> dig google.com
[20:19] <vl4kn0> ActionParsnip: what? that is not an option. Only thing I want to do is to use non-monospaced fonts in gnome-terminal
[20:20] <roll> dodo 3773: nope
[20:20] <dr_willis> Non-mono spaces will look poor in many cases
[20:20] <roll> At this point I think that it is the provider...
[20:20] <roll> but why doesn't resolve only in firefox?
[20:20] <ActionParsnip> Vl4kn0: what is the output of: cat /etc/issue
[20:21] <roll> wait, if i ping as root ICMP works
[20:21] <BillyZane|2> hi dr_willis
[20:21] <roll> so this means that is not the provider blocking my connections
[20:21] <ActionParsnip> Roll ^
[20:21] <roll> could be any privilege problem?

[20:56] <elijah> I have a program called XXXpath  but I cannot remember XXX. How can I search via CLI all installed binaries?
=== tensorpuddin is now known as tensorpudding
[20:56] <elijah> locate XXXpath would work but I don't know XXX, I did a man locate but it doesn't appear to have wildcard functionality
[20:57] <elijah> I can grep but that seems to be overkill
[20:57] <elijah> Is there something like ctrl+r for history, where I can interactively search all available programs?
[20:57] <bekks> elijah: find / -type f -iname "*path"
[20:58] <blkadder> locate supports regex
[20:58] <llutz> elijah: locate *path
[20:59] <FunkyELF> how can I tell the version of graphics driver being used right now?  I want to see if an apt-get upgrade updates it

[21:03] <Bsims> awesomess3: slightly newer kernel but you can install that via backports

[21:05] <llutz> dhanasekaran:  /var/spool/cron/crontabs/
[21:05] <escott> winterpk, do you have a separate /boot partition?
[21:05] <kale> in gnome, how do i select a new window decoration?
[21:05] <winterpk> escott: no I do not.  I only have 2 HDD's and want them in RAID 0
[21:05] <kingbeast> Is anyone else getting a confetti effect in flashplayer after the chrome update?
[21:05] <winterpk> escott: how can I do this and also have a boot partition?
[21:05] <escott> winterpk, you create the mdadm array spanning sda2 and sdb2
[21:06] <awesomess3> kingbeast, when I updated flash, flash stopped working for me on chrome and firefox.
[21:06] <awesomess3> kingbeast, something about my CPU not being able to compute sse2
[21:06] <winterpk> escott: so I need two RAID arrays?
[21:06] <awesomess3> kingbeast, my solution was to download/install an older flash
[21:07] <escott> winterpk, no you have one array with devices sda2 and sdb2 as components of the array
[21:07] <escott> winterpk, in generally you should never be creating an mdadm array across raw disk. unless you aren't using mdadm in which case you might tell us what you are using
[21:07] <winterpk> escott: can I use the ubuntu installation disk?
[21:07] <kingbeast> awesomess3, mine works fine in firefox, it works in chrome, it's just covered with a confetti look

[21:10] <noiro> can someone help me setup an ftp server? I can log into it if I connect through localhost, but connecting through an IP gives me a problem. Do I need to port forward? ssh works right out of the box
[21:11] <escott> noiro, why do you need ftp. why not use the sftp module in openssh?
[21:11] <llutz> noiro: "sudo lsof -i :21"
[21:11] <dhanasekaran> llutz: thanks

=== awesomess3 is now known as psycho23
=== psycho23 is now known as awesomess3
[21:12] <escott> noiro, when people say "ftp" they often just mean "some way to transfer files with ftp commands like put/get/ls/cd" in which case you can use sftp which is more secure
[21:13] <noiro> escott, I want to pull and place files from a Windows computer (the one I"m on at the time usually is) and yes, sending and receiving files is all I really need'
[21:13] <noiro> I just think a GUI would be faster
[21:13] <calimero_82> i've resolved :)
[21:13] <llutz> noiro: winscp, filezilla support sftp too.
[21:13] <escott> noiro, then you have a lot of better options than installing an ftp server. i would start by putting "sftp://your_computer_name_here" and seeing if that works from windows
[21:15] <noiro> escott: how would I see if filezilla supported it?
[21:15] <ernest_> Hey guys, I still need help getting the drivers for a Biostar A880G+ ATI Radeon DH4250 to run my HDMI port
[21:15] <escott> noiro, filezilla does support sftp
[21:15] <noiro> escott: so I just log into filezilla via port 22?
[21:16] <escott> noiro, sftp is just ssh so yes it uses port 22

[21:20] <mathe_frage> route add -net 172.16.0.8 netmask 255.255.255.248 gw 172.16.0.14 dev eth1
[21:20] <mathe_frage> I have 2 Networks: 172.16.0.0 255.255.255.248 and 172.16.0.8 255.255.255.248

[21:20] <escott> noiro, "to X11" what does that mean?
[21:20] <Bsims> Benxyzzy: heh next type man man ... its the manual for the manual
[21:20] <noiro> escott: trying to display a GUI version of Eclipse over X11
[21:21] <escott> mathe_frage, before dumping the table on us could you explain the issue
[21:21] <mathe_frage> my network configuration: http://pastebin.com/PMfRhr0A
[21:21] <noiro> (though I'm not evne sure if eclipse has a CLI version)
[21:21] <escott> noiro, why would that now work?
[21:21] <escott> noiro, why would that not work?
[21:21] <noiro> It would require a ton of bandwidth and ssh is super slow. It'd lag too much to be of much use.
[21:21] <Bsims> Benxyzzy: last stupid console trick try calendar
[21:21] <escott> noiro, if you are having an issue with that state the issue
[21:21] <mathe_frage> escott i can: i simply have 3 pcs
[21:22] <k1l> mathe_frage: you know that 11.04 is EOL ?
[21:22] <Bsims> I'm trying to install remastersys... I've added the key and the repo to apt but it still says unauthenticated package and will not install any ideas?
[21:22] <mathe_frage> 2 windows clients and 1 ubuntu 11.04 router, from my windows client i can ping both gateways but not the other windows client
[21:22] <escott> noiro, X isn't actually bandwidth heavy which is part of the problem, but it is very latency sensitive. many people are now switching to more bandwidth intensive but less latency sensitive things like freeNX or VNC
[21:23] <k1l> and if its a router i would definitely recommend to upgrade first because of the security updates the services got recently.
[21:23] <mathe_frage> its only for testing in a virtual machine
[21:24] <escott> mathe_frage, perhaps you should look into bridging
[21:24] <noiro> I really don't need VNC and I personally find VNC buggy (in addition to requiring refresh rates). Isn't FreeNX work much like SSH in that you can open individual windows from the server on the machine instead of being forced to see the entire screen?

[21:42] <BluesKaj> orudie, what do you want to use , analog or digital out ?
[21:42] <winterpk> Apparently I need a boot partition for raid 0 to work.  How do I do this if I only have 2 dirves?
[21:43] <BluesKaj> ernest_, are there any drivers listed there ?
[21:43] <escott> winterpk, you partition the drive and then give partitions to the array.
[21:43] <winterpk> escott: I couldn't figure out exactly what you told me to do earlier

[21:43] <sybariten> How the hell do i get to the font settings, to turn off hinting and such?
[21:43] <winterpk> ok but then why does it say I need a boot partition?

[21:44] <escott> winterpk, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SoftwareRAID
[21:44] <BluesKaj> orudie, install pavucontrol , that's the easiest way , it gives those options
[21:45] <ernest_> The HDMI port on my Biostar A880G+ doesnt work, i remeber additional drivers dled the drivers in oneiric
[21:45] <BluesKaj> ernest_, and what's your graphics card ?
[21:45] <escott> winterpk, you
[21:46] <ernest_> Blueskaj, Is this what you need: ATI Radeon HD4250?
[21:46] <escott> winterpk, you've been very vague about what difficulties you are having. so i have to be equally vague in response
[21:46] <winterpk> this is the part that confuses me escott: Warning: the /boot filesystem cannot use any softRAID level other than 1 with the stock Ubuntu bootloader.
[21:46] <ernest_> BluesKaj, its integrated onto the MB
[21:46] <winterpk> I am not being vague.  I get the bootloader error
[21:47] <winterpk> trying to set up RAID 0 with two HDD's I get the bootloader error.  Obviously I need /boot, but I don't know how to do that with RAID 0
[21:47] <orudie> BluesKaj: can't see the option there
[21:47] <escott> winterpk, grub has trouble reading RAID0. you should have a /boot partition that is not RAIDed or is RAID1. what is confusing about that
[21:47] <redheadcupcake> Can someone help me with copying Tails to a USB drive. I have the .iso file, it just wont work per the instructions on the tails website

=== bearovercloud_ is now known as bearovercloud
[21:48] <ccc> I am trying to get hMail email server running. I installed it in wine as a windows 2000 program
[21:48] <winterpk> escott: Its confusing because I'm using only 2 HDD's and can't understand how make a /boot partition on them
[21:48] <escott> winterpk, you partition the disk, and when you create your mdadm raid arrays you either don't raid the smaller partition for /boot or you RAID1 the /boot partitions
[21:49] <ernest_> BluesKaj, did I give you the info you neede?
[21:49] <ccc> but since it is adminstarted by an icon in the systray of windows how do i access the admin through wine?
[21:49] <Ziber> My mysql refuses to start, syslog says it's respawning to fast. Thoughts on fixing this?
[21:49] <BluesKaj> orudie, look in the oitputs tab and use the dropdowns to choose
[21:49] <orudie> BluesKaj: thanks, looking there now ...
[21:49] <escott> winterpk, you create the partition before you create the mdadm raid array. unless you aren't using mdadm i really don't see what could possibly be confusing about this
[21:49] <winterpk> escott: ok so I should partition only like 95% of both discs?  How is this NOT confusing?
[21:49] <BluesKaj> ernest_, yes ...checking
[21:50] <orudie> BluesKaj: okay, I have a USB headset, its not shown there, unless it shows up as "headphones"
[21:50] <blkadder> Ziber: Something in your config may be foobard...
[21:50] <escott> winterpk, yes, you RAID0 across sda2/sdb2 which is slightly less than the full disk
[21:50] <winterpk> escott: ok that makes sense. So I how much storage should I leave behind for the /boot?
[21:51] <orudie> BluesKaj: yeah its not losted there
[21:51] <escott> winterpk, 1GB is certainly sufficient
[21:51] <ccc> how are windows services treated in wine?
[21:51] <Ziber> blkadder: It's a freshly installed system...
[21:51] <escott> winterpk, if you want to have swap there is no good reason to put swap on raid so also pull that out
[21:51] <blkadder> Ziber: What do the logs say?
[21:51] <Ziber> blkadder: syslog? or mysql.log?
[21:52] <blkadder> Let's try syslog.
[21:52] <winterpk> escott: ok I will. so my problem now is that I already created the raid array with all my storage.  How do I delete it or resize it?
[21:53] <Ziber> blkadder: http://pastebin.com/80cXWU6W
[21:53] <escott> winterpk, you can delete it by deleting the entire partition table on both disks and creating a new one, im sure you could resize it by first resizing whatever filesystem is on that raid device and then shrinking the raid container
[21:53] <winterpk> escott: thank you
[21:54] <iceroot> escott: swap should also be on the raid, raid is for "high available" and if one HDD is failing (and it is the hdd which is holding swap" your system may be dead

[21:57] <iceroot> ccc: and its still public then
[21:57] <ccc> yes you can i already have with hmail server in wondows
[21:58] <ernest_> blueskaj, this MB has vga, hdmi, and dvi, I can run vga and hdmi at the same in mirror, but i see nothing on the tv and i do on the vga
[21:58] <iceroot> ccc: if you host a mailserver with your private ip adress from your dsl account most mailservers will block your mails because these ip ranges are blocked (to much spam)
[21:58] <BluesKaj> ernest_, have you checked that you have the correct input from your pc selected on the tv?
[21:58] <cinco> ernest_: might be wrong resoluition?
[21:58] <DexterF> usr13: just hooked up the laptop's eth0 to my regular router's WAN port and set the router to dhcp - works and ubuntu does all the NATting. duh :) (the umts stunt from earlier today)
[21:58] <escott> iceroot, he is going RAID0
[21:59] <iceroot> escott: ah sorry didnt saw it, thought RAID1
[21:59] <ccc> how would you suggest a person have thier own email adress then that isnt under control of 'the system'
[21:59] <ernest_> bluesKaj and cinco, I see the Bios setup on the tv and vga but when i boot ubuntu no more on the tv, also i have tried every resolution listed
[21:59] <iceroot> ccc: public server (vserver) with postfix + courier-imap
[22:00] <tbruff13> iceroot, can i ask you for some help if possible
[22:00] <cinco> ernest_: you cant get anything on your tv at all?
[22:00] <iceroot> tbruff13: just ask the channel, if someone knows the answe he/she will help you :)
[22:00] <ccc> that sounds complicated
[22:00] <ernest_> cinco, only bios setup, but nothing ubuntu related
[22:00] <ccc> i am a frim bleiever that yahoo and gmail should not control the world of email
[22:00] <ccc> firm believer
[22:00] <iceroot> ccc: because of that i said "dont administrate a system if you dont know what you are doing"
[22:01] <schmoost1r> hi all... is there a specific place I can ask about issues with 13.04/raring?
[22:01] <iceroot> ccc: it will end up in a warez-server, open spam relay and so on
[22:01] <iceroot> schmoost1r: #ubuntu+1
[22:01] <schmoost1r> ta
[22:01] <BluesKaj> ernest_, disconnect the VGA , it might take precedence over DVI and HDMI , different signals
[22:01] <tbruff13> I am having an issue with the sound on my new sony vaio it works but it is low
[22:01] <schmoost1r> iceroot++ # in case there's a bot watching
[22:01] <ernest_> BluesKaj, let me try
[22:02] <ccc> i do not feel comfortable with my lifes email going to some corporation
[22:02] <tbruff13> and then i downloaded pulseaudio volume control and I could turn it up much loader
[22:02] <tbruff13> louder
[22:02] <ernest_> Blueskaj, do I do this with it on? or turn it off and do like that, also wouldnt mirror show the same thing on both screens?
[22:03] <tbruff13> is there anyway I can fix kubuntu to work that way or make pulseaudio control my default controller
[22:03] <MonkeyDust> ccc  discussions ad opinions in #ubuntu-offtopic, please
[22:03] <MonkeyDust> and*
[22:03] <BluesKaj> turn the tv and pc off to do this , ernest_ then power them ip again
[22:04] <winterpk> escott: one final question. I do not seem to have an sda2 and sba2.  How do I get those to appear?
[22:04] <ernest_> BluesKaj, ok give me a sec to do this
[22:04] <BluesKaj> ok
[22:04] <escott> winterpk, when you partition the first disk the second disk on that partition is sda2
[22:05] <escott> winterpk, when you partition the first disk the second partition on that disk is sda2
[22:05] <winterpk> should I automatically partition the disc?
[22:06] <escott> winterpk, no you need to manually partition it. you need a partition for /boot. you need any partitions you intend to use for swap, and you need any other partitions you dont want inside the raid array. finally you have the raid partition, which you join with the other raid partition to make the array

[22:07] <winterpk> escott: great, thanks!
[22:08] <ernest_> BluesKaj, nothing, what happend was, after i saw the hardware info i got unsupported signal like i have been getting but it went away for a comple of seconds then came back, then i connected the vga and here i am
[22:09] <winterpk> escott: So I'm going to create a single partition on each drive at 99% which will be my RAID 0. The rest will be for /boot and swap.  Does that seem right?
[22:10] <escott> winterpk, sure. but /boot and the swap need to be different partitions.
[22:11] <winterpk> escott: ok good to know, thanks!
[22:12] <BluesKaj> sorry ernest_ ..I'm out of ideas , and i have to go.
[22:12] <ernest_> BluesKaj, also when i look under display it says theres a sony 72" connected but its really a 32" and i cant change any settings for it
[22:12] <dxtr_1> Hellooo
[22:12] <dxtr_1> :)
[22:13] <ernest_> Blueskaj, ok ok, thanks anyways
[22:13] <dxtr_1> Can anybody helps me
[22:13] <DX099> hello all
[22:13] <dxtr_1> hey DX099
[22:13] <DX099> I got a new six core computer
[22:14] <MonkeyDust> dxtr_1  start with a question
[22:14] <DX099> will it be usefull to recompile the kernel for me so that it can take full advantage of this or is the current ubuntu kernels optimized enough ?
[22:14] <dxtr_1> ok
[22:15] <llutz> DX099: if you have to ask this, the default kernel is fine for you :)
[22:15] <DX099> llutz, if I have to ask this ? can you explain ?
[22:16] <dxtr_1> well i'm struggling with PALTALK using wine , i can't get it to work . i want to use paltalk express (a web version of paltalk) it doesn't work too they logged me off everytime i try to login
[22:16] <escott> DX099, you should make sure you are using a linux version greater than 2.0
[22:16] <DX099> escott, I was talking about last Ubuntu 12.10 for example.
[22:16] <dxtr_1> i tried paltalk in a virtual machine(xp) but paltalk doesn't allow free accounts on free machines
[22:17] <llutz> DX099: there are only small benefits in recompiling an own kernel. and those are mostly for special purposes. so if you don't know what special setting you might need and have to ask, you don't need to compile a kernel at all
[22:17] <MonkeyDust> dxtr_1  ask in #winehq
[22:17] <DX099> llutz, ok
[22:17] <DX099> thanks
[22:17] <llutz> DX099: no offense
[22:18] <dxtr_1> Thnx MonkeyDust
[22:18] <dxtr_1> :)
[22:18] <escott> DX099, uname -r will tell you your kernel version number. if it is less than version 2.0 then you won't be able to get the full benefit of your 6-core CPU
[22:18] <DX099> llutz, learning is more useful than getting offended by such statements
[22:18] <DX099> escott, Ubuntu 12.10 default is 3.5 series I think.
[22:19] <escott> DX099, then you are in good shape
[22:19] <sybariten> what is ubuntu-desktop?
[22:19] <DX099> escott, thanks as well
[22:20] <elementz> Hi all. Since the last system update, I have a strange error with flash videos, there is an overlay of colored snowflakes over every video, see a screenshot here: http://snag.gy/81h4v.jpg
[22:20] <elementz> this happens in chrome on ubuntu 12.04 with flash version 11,5,31,137
[22:21] <elementz> i couldn't find anything related on launchpad
[22:21] <rushy> what would cause ubuntu not to start up after bios? i did a brand new install on new hard drive and it will install then once thats done it will restart and the bios will go through everything but just hang after it see the hard drives and pci devices
[22:22] <sybariten> and where do i change font settings?
[22:22] <escott> rushy, does grub get loaded?
[22:22] <rushy> no
[22:22] <escott> rushy, in that case grub must not be installed to the devices that the bios is trying to boot
[22:23] <rushy> i've installed this like 10 times
[22:23] <rushy> both ubuntu and suse
[22:23] <escott> rushy, might you have installed to a gpt disk but not created the grub_bios partition
[22:23] <escott> rushy, might you be installing to an efi/bios system in the wrong mode (bios instead of efi)
[22:24] <rushy> how would i know that i'm installing it in the wrong mode?
[22:24] <rushy> or how would i specifiy where it installs?
[22:25] <escott> rushy, first off is this an efi system? you said you were able to install and boot it in the past right?
=== dniMretsaM is now known as dniMretsaM_away
[22:25] <rushy> no i haven't been able to boot it
[22:25] <rushy> its a fresh install. new hard drive and all
[22:26] <escott> rushy, so you probably dont even know if this is efi. is it a brand new system?
[22:26] <rushy> no i do not know if its efi
[22:27] <escott> rushy, boot the livecd and check if there is a /sys/firmware/efi directory. also paste.ubuntu.com the output of "sudo parted -l"
[22:27] <Miebster_> There is an application with an icon in the unity launch bar.  The icon doesn't tell me what application it is, when I right click it I have no options, I can't close it.  How can I found out what application is running so I can kill it?
[22:28] <rushy> i can't boot in live, i'm installing server side
[22:28] <escott> rushy, then get to a console in a linux environment
[22:28] <escott> rushy, presumably ctrl-alt-f1/f2 should get you to a proper console
[22:29] <Plagman> Hi, does anyone know what is responsible for populating the ~/.debug/.build-id symlink tree?
[22:29] <Plagman> I assume it's a runtime process that happens after you install -dbgsym packages
[22:29] <modifier> how to install wine on x64 12.10 ? sudo apt-get install wine is giving error -  The following packages have unmet dependencies:  wine : Depends: wine1.4 but it is not going to be installed E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages.

[22:30] <zvacet> modifier: sudo apt-get -f install
[22:30] <ubottu> modifier "you have held broken packages": pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[22:31] <modifier> escott: what does it means ? broken packages - packages are missing or some installed packages are bad ?
[22:31] <remontees> Al-Kashi.
=== remontees is now known as Al-Kashi
[22:32] <escott> modifier, it says you are holding a package. assuming that is true you did that yourself or perhaps you installed a ppa which introduced the hold
[22:32] <escott> modifier, try the apt-get -f install as suggested by zvacet
[22:33] <modifier> sudo apt-get -f install wine and sudo apt-get install -f wine both ways same error escott zvacet
[22:34] <SierraAR> gparted isnt detected the hard drive installed on my laptop when booting off a disk
[22:34] <escott> modifier, then apt-get update, check your ppa's, check that you aren't pinning or holding anything

[22:36] <escott> eGetin, or http://askubuntu.com/questions/163757/pulseaudio-network-tutorial
[22:36] <zvacet> modifier: that command will not get you to the next release maybe will resolve your holding packages  ;)

[22:37] <modifier> zvacet: ok
[22:37] <escott> eGetin, its not something ive ever done. im just googling for pulseaudio network sound server ubuntu
[22:37] <escott> SierraAR, "booting off a disk" what kind of disk?
[22:38] <escott> modifier, do you have any PPAs installed
[22:38] <modifier> should i install aptitude or simple apt-get and synaptic are good enough ? and should i install filezilla from repos or download from original site ?
[22:38] <modifier> escott: noo...i dont even know how to play with ppa ;(
[22:39] <zvacet> modifier: synaptic is good enough
[22:39] <modifier> what about filezilla ?? zvacet

[22:40] <SierraAR> Or R or something like that
[22:40] <zvacet> modifier: I donÂ´t know if repos have latest version but if that is no problem install from repos
[22:40] <escott> SierraAR, cat /proc/partitions shows what?
[22:41] <DavEd3464> hey who knows where are ati radeon hd 3200 libs for ubuntu 12.10
[22:41] <eGetin> escott: those actually helped :D
[22:41] <eGetin> thank you very much.
[22:42] <eGetin> I guess there was something different to those I've seen before :P
[22:42] <zvacet> DavEd3464: use radeon driver
[22:42] <SierraAR> escott, one second, will have to manually type out what it shows. the laptop I'm running this on doesnt have an internet connection atm
[22:42] <escott> DavEd3464, what does that mean?

[22:44] <DavEd3464> really?
[22:44] <modifier> zvacet: what about filezilla ??

[22:45] <DavEd3464> ok ok
[22:45] <smokingfreek> the name and the number of your card
[22:45] <SierraAR> escott, http://pastebin.com/7GiPDMM0
[22:45] <zvacet> modifier: install it from repos if you can I Â´m not familiar with filezilla
[22:46] <k1ll> I'm using ubuntu 12.04 LTE with a new intel sdd. I read in ubuntu's wiki about TRIM. But is TRIM for older sdd's? I mean my ssd supports trim
[22:46] <modifier> zvacet: yea ok....srry i didn't saw ur previous reply
[22:46] <escott> SierraAR, so it sees one hard disk with 7 partitions
[22:46] <zvacet> modifier: np  :)
[22:46] <smokingfreek> filezilla can help you with to mannage and transver files to a server
[22:46] <SierraAR> escott, I'm wanting to completely wipe the harddrive and create two 250GB partitions on it with gparted
[22:46] <smokingfreek> filezilla can help you with to mannage and transver files to a server
[22:46] <SierraAR> But it's not showing the drive in gparter
[22:46] <SierraAR> gparted*
[22:46] <escott> k1ll, depends on how much you trust your firmware
[22:47] <zvacet> smokingfreek: I know that but I never worked with it so I donÂ´t want to give tips about things I didnÂ´t use
[22:47] <modifier> zvacet: btw.....is it a good idea to compile the source from original coder rather then using repo everytime.....maybe this will provide latest build but a lil work though ?
[22:47] <escott> SierraAR, so sda is the correct disk but it doesnt appear in gparted?
[22:47] <SierraAR> yeah
[22:48] <k1ll> escott: so you think I should use TRIM?
[22:48] <escott> SierraAR, thats very strange. are you looking in the right place? you could also use the command line tool "sudo parted /dev/sda
[22:48] <zvacet> modifier: if you are not satisfied with version from repos you can always compile latest
[22:49] <modifier> zvacet: do u compile everytime ?
[22:49] <SierraAR> I'm doing what I did the last time I reformatted a drive on gparted - Loading up the program, clicking 'refresh drives'. But everythings grayed out and it doesnt seem to see any drives at all
[22:49] <zvacet> modifier:no  :)
[22:49] <escott> k1ll, its not a question we can really answer. check online for how well your particular SSD handles TRIM. some handle it but slowly and badly, some firmware i wouldn't touch with a 10ft flaming spike
[22:49] <sybariten> I'm on "software sources" and "additional drivers" tab. I can see that an open source one is selected for my AMD card, and i can choose from two "proprietary" drivcers. Does that sometimes improve performance?
[22:49] <escott> SierraAR, maybe you need to "gksudo gparted"?
[22:50] <zvacet> modifier: there is no need to compile every time when you want to install something
=== ixio is now known as stueng
[22:50] <modifier> zvacet: hmm ok
[22:50] <zvacet> modifier: what about packages on hold did you solve that one?
[22:50] <modifier> no
[22:51] <modifier> ok dist-upgrade zvacet
[22:51] <modifier> i mean i am doing it now
[22:51] <zvacet> modifier	: ok
[22:52] <SierraAR> escott, I'll give that a shot, though I'm worried I'll completely ruin the hdd
[22:52] <k1ll> escott, ok for example my SSD handles TRIM good, should I use TRIM on Ubunto, too?
[22:53] <escott> k1ll, yes
[22:53] <modifier> zvacet: its showing a screen full of packages to be upgraded....with some ones to be installed ?
[22:53] <modifier> some new* ones

[22:54] <SierraAR> Brand new western digital
[22:54] <escott> SierraAR, check the smart status with gnome-disks or smartctl
[22:54] <escott> SierraAR, and new things can never ever break. its the law
[22:55] <SierraAR> escott, neither of those seem to be on the boot disk
[22:55] <escott> SierraAR, you said you were using the server disk. i dont know what is on the server disk
[22:55] <modifier> zvacet: ok....how to backup these upgrades and all installed apps so as to restore them afterwards or install them freshly or on other system  ? i know aptoncd for apt
[22:55] <escott> !clone | modifier
[22:55] <ubottu> modifier: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type Â« aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages Â», move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type Â« sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install Â» (this may cause problems with multiarch before 12.10) - See also !automate

[22:56] <SierraAR> The PC version
[22:56] <escott> SierraAR, i would have thought the gnome-disks tool would be on the livecd, but if its not you could apt-get install it
[22:57] <zvacet> modifier: yes you can use aptoncd or simply copy content of var/cache/apt/archives to another folder
[22:57] <cinco> one qick question, im running on a ssd now. is there something i should do to improve preformance after install ?
[22:57] <SierraAR> I can't get an internet connection on the laptop right now :/
[22:57] <escott> !ssd
[22:58] <modifier> zvacet: apt copying and aptoncd are easy for me but that aptitude thing looks complicated escott
[22:58] <escott> cinco, noatime,nodiratime if you dont need atime is good, discard if you trust that

[22:58] <ubottu> modifier, please see my private message
[22:59] <modifier> zvacet: yes sure....and thnx :)
[22:59] <escott> SierraAR, there are some livecd's more focused on hardware diagnostics and recovery. you might try one of those

[23:00] <cinco> escott: do i edit this in fstab or something?
[23:00] <jesteven> something speak spanish?
[23:00] <escott> cinco, yes those are fstab mount options. another common recommendation is to switch the io scheduler
[23:00] <modifier> escott: does these upgrades by dist-upgrade also get downloaded in apt folder ?

[23:01] <cinco> escott: thank you
[23:01] <escott> modifier, yes
[23:01] <SierraAR> escott, also, what does it mean when it says 'Daemon is inhibited' when I try formatting a flash drive or hdd using disk utility?
[23:02] <escott> SierraAR, i honestly don't know. does it say which daemon is involved?
[23:02] <SierraAR> Nope. Details just say 'Daemon is inhibited'
[23:03] <escott> SierraAR, what application is this
[23:03] <SierraAR> Disk Utility
[23:03] <SierraAR> that exact name
[23:03] <SierraAR> I used it earlier on another machine to reformat a couple USB drives for use with reinstalling windows on a partition on this drive
[23:03] <escott> SierraAR, presumably whatever backend daemon that app talks to to do work. maybe udisksd but that doesn't seem to be its role
[23:04] <escott> SierraAR, also disk utility is gnome-disks and will show you the smart status
[23:04] <rustler770> Anybody been able to get mod_mono working?
[23:04] <SierraAR> Ahh
[23:05] <SierraAR> 'SMART status: Not Supported'
[23:05] <SierraAR> I can see all of the partitions from the old installs on the drive in disk utility, too
[23:05] <escott> SierraAR, then either libatasmart4 is not installed or your hardware doesnt support smart
[23:05] <i7c> after updates my grub settings are lost (timeout disabled)... where do i have to edit the config file? in /etc? or directly in /boot?
[23:06] <nabblet> hi, do i have to download the 64 or the 32 version of ubutnut vor the lenovo t430?
[23:06] <escott> i7c, /etc/default/grub then update-grub
[23:06] <i7c> escott thx
[23:07] <escott> nabblet, how much ram does that computer have?
[23:07] <SierraAR> Ok gonna see if I can find an ethernet cable for this thing
[23:07] <rustler770> need mono expert!
[23:08] <ernest_> Hey guys, I got my HDMI port running now
[23:08] <i7c> nabblet: is it a 64 bit CPU? i would have guessed so....
[23:08] <nabblet> escott, don't know - i don't have access to it - just was told the model number
[23:08] <SierraAR> escott, should I search for and install libatasmart4?
[23:09] <escott> nabblet, you probably want to go with 64bit. unless it were a very ram-constrained system you will benefit more from the extra registers
[23:09] <escott> SierraAR, what does dpkg -l "*smart*" say
[23:09] <nabblet> escott, i7c hm, they offer 64 bit windows for it http://shop.lenovo.com/SEUILibrary/controller/e/web/LenovoPortal/en_US/catalog.workflow:category.details?current-catalog-id=12F0696583E04D86B9B79B0FEC01C087&current-category-id=FC448E05D12BD000069CA73F6D0D1FA8
[23:09] <paul__> hello, i have a problem, it's with my sound, whenever i turn it down lower that 40% it doesnt work at all, does anyone know why?
[23:09] <nabblet> so i guess i will go with the 64 bit version
[23:09] <gustav__> I'm getting a segfault trying to run a game in Steam. What should I do? I tried deleting all data and downloading it again.
[23:10] <ernest_> but i did run into another problem. I think this problem is easyer to solve. Ive gone down every single resolution option for the tv display and only 3 work but i can see anything except the middle of the desktop
[23:10] <escott> gustav__, write to steam and tell them it is segfaulting

[23:13] <Luiscipher> ciao

[23:13] <escott> SierraAR, one would expect that to support smart. either gnome-disks is confused or the hardware has really bitten the dust and cant even report its smart status

[23:13] <escott> SierraAR, you can check dmesg

=== stueng is now known as ixio
[23:20] <Gyro54> Can you just move the HOME directory to a different computer? Is it that simple?
[23:20] <MonkeyDust> Gyro54  make sure you create a separate /home partition, it's easier when you want to reinstall ubuntu

Today, she calls me up and tells me that things have crashed on her and she can't get her computer to work. She wants me to tell you all what her computer says, and maybe get some help. So, here goes: GNU GRUB version 1.99-12ubuntu5.1 minimal BASH-like line editing is supported. For the first word, TAB lists possible command completion. anywhere else
[23:32] <elkingrey> TAB lists possible device for file completion. grub >
[23:32] <SonikkuAmerica> elkingrey: Does that appear immediately after the computer boots up?
[23:32] <daftykins> ernest_: ok, well i'm glad you've tried. you'll need to install some ATI drivers and then use their app to fix the overscan i'd expect. have a google for your card, the ubuntu version you're running and 'overscan' as the keyword
[23:32] <atlef> !educational > atlef
[23:32] <elkingrey> SinikkuAmerica: Yes. It's immediate.
[23:33] <atlef> !edubuntu > atlef
[23:33] <ubottu> atlef, please see my private message
[23:33] <elkingrey> SonikkuAmerica: ^^
[23:34] <SonikkuAmerica> elkingrey: I would head over to the #grub channel for that kind of question.
[23:34] <SonikkuAmerica> elkingrey: Type [ /join #grub ] in the window
[23:34] <ernest_> daftykins, ive done searched the ati and ubuntu verson all day, i cant find any drivers for nothing, and additional drivers on 12.10 doesnt get me the drivers needed
[23:34] <daftykins> ernest_: i see, so it doesn't offer you fglrx?
[23:35] <eGetin> hrmph, flash doesn't seem to like my sound setup
[23:36] <ernest_> well the reason i upgraded from 11.10 to 12.10 is because i deleted that file and had no video driver. Now that i upgraded i should have gotten that driver back? right?
[23:36] <hipitihop> bobolopolis, thanks, so is that the recommended route ?
[23:36] <adamk> ernest_: That GPU is only supported by the legacy fglrx driver now.  I do not know if that will work on the Xorg and kernel version in Ubuntu 12.10, but if it's not showing up as an option, my guess is 'no'.
[23:37] <bobolopolis> hipitihop: its the best way to get the latest version. i doubt the normal ubuntu repos will upgrade to the 4.2.x series
=== truexfan404 is now known as truexfan81
[23:37] <adamk> ernest_: If that's the case, you're only real option for 12.10 is to stick with the open source drivers.
[23:37] <ernest_> adamk so either that or go back down to 11.10?
[23:38] <adamk> Well, I believe the fglrx driver packages for 12.04 will support your GPU.
[23:38] <adamk> Or you could try installing the legacy driver manually.  I have no idea if that will work.
[23:39] <ernest_> and to do that i need to uninstall my current one right?
[23:39] <adamk> Which one do you have installed?
[23:39] <ernest_> how do i look that up?
[23:39] <adamk> Well presumably you would know if you installed a 3rd party driver...
[23:40] <ernest_> i tried to do. ended up screwing it all up
[23:41] <adamk> Well fglrx comes with an uninstaller...  Somewhere under /usr/share/ati/ or maybe /usr/share/amd/
[23:41] <PeterGriffin> ernest_: I see that in the repository there is fglrx. Why don't you try sudo apt-get install fglrx
[23:41] <daftykins> ernest_: pastebin /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[23:41] <god> i have decided that from no on, when something quits working, i will remove it.
[23:42] <god> no reinstall, just remove it gone bye bye
[23:42] <SonikkuAmerica> Oh--kay...
[23:42] <daftykins> god: if you got given that computer, do you know that it's even stable? ;)
[23:42] <escott> ernest_, generally apt is not going to reinstall things you have removed or reset config files you delete. it will try to respect the changes you make to the default config
[23:42] <god> all i know is it is an e machine
[23:43] <SonikkuAmerica> god: Oh fun.
[23:43] <god> i have had it for awhile and just now started with all of these problems
[23:43] <kslater> so how does one turn off the Unity wizzy effect of sending my window fullscreen when I pause in the middle of a monitor on a multi-monitor setup?
[23:43] <ernest_> i feel im way over my head on this one
[23:44] <SonikkuAmerica> god: But my disgust for Acer in general aside, I would probably run [ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ] to make sure everything is in there.
[23:44] <adamk> ernest_: What are you hoping to get out of the proprietary driver that you aren't getting from the open source one?
[23:44] <daftykins> ernest_: if you can pastebin the above log file, we can work out what driver is in use right now. probably 'radeon'
[23:44] <god> i just updated the other day
[23:44] <daftykins> adamk: he needs to be able to fix overscan. if you know how to do that with non-proprietary, go for it
[23:44] <god> that is when all the problems started
[23:44] <escott> daftykins, manually set the scan parameters of the modeline
[23:44] <SonikkuAmerica> god: to what? from what?
[23:45] <ernest_> im trying to get my screen on my tv to look ok, its overscaned i think someone said
[23:45] <god> i updated from synaptic pag mgr
[23:45] <emx> is there a release date for skype v6?
[23:45] <ernest_> and the drivers that i had in 11.10 came from additional drivers but that doesnt work in 12.10
[23:45] <SonikkuAmerica> From 10.04 to 12.04 or what?
[23:45] <daftykins> emx: phone Microsoft and ask
[23:45] <god> 12.04
[23:45] <SonikkuAmerica> god: See my question aboxe >>>
[23:46] <SonikkuAmerica> *above
[23:46] <daftykins> escott: are you sure that has anything to do with overscan?
[23:46] <god> i have had 12.04 for awhile now
[23:46] <god> i stick with it
[23:46] <emx> daftykins, you destroyed my hope
[23:46] <daftykins> emx: cool
[23:46] <SonikkuAmerica> god: Why use Synaptic in 12.04 (unless you're running Lubuntu in which case you should upgrade to 12.10)
[23:46] <escott> ernest_, modeline issues usually mean result in either black bars on the sides, or part of the image cut off. what does "look bad" mean
=== TheRainbowDusk is now known as TheRainbowDawn
[23:47] <escott> daftykins, thats a scanline/modeline thing. the whole modeline business is weird to have to deal with in the digital age, but its still there when the edid information is wrong
[23:47] <god> i am new to this and i have no idea how to upgrade
[23:47] <SonikkuAmerica> General question: is 14.04 the next slated LTS release:
[23:48] <SonikkuAmerica> god: Which desktop environment do you have? (If you don't know describe it)
[23:48] <daftykins> escott: i'm getting a feeling of crossed-wires here, because he's got a perfect image into a TV over HDMI, it's just overscanning due to the nature of graphics cards and TVs
[23:48] <ernest_> escott, i can only see half the icon bar on the left, i cant see the top bar either.
[23:49] <god> it is the one with the side bar is all i know
[23:49] <SonikkuAmerica> god: OK, that's called Unity (which is regular Ubuntu)
[23:49] <ernest_> daftykins, http://pastebin.com/ieDextTT
[23:49] <god> ok
[23:49] <god> i do not like the side bar
[23:49] <escott> ernest_, so you can play around with modelines and xrandr http://xtiming.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/xtiming.pl
[23:50] <SonikkuAmerica> god: You have a few options in regard to that...
[23:50] <escott> ernest_, its also possible that the TV itself is doing some zooming so check the settings in its menu
[23:50] <god> please help me!!!
[23:50] <shojo> change your nick first
[23:50] <SonikkuAmerica> ernest_: Are you sure you can't shrink the screen size from your TV menu?
[23:50] <daftykins> ernest_: yep 'radeon' driver is in use. you might as well try fglrx
[23:50] <SonikkuAmerica> god: What did you want?
[23:50] <shojo> o,h hi daftykins
[23:51] <god> i would like an o.s. that does not require anti virus and plays flash and movies well
[23:51] <god> that is about all i do on here
[23:51] <ernest_> my tv has all zooms off
[23:51] <SonikkuAmerica> god: Let me push this to PM
[23:51] <ernest_> daftykins, do i go to the software center and install it from there?
[23:51] <god> ok
[23:52] <escott> ernest_, with an analog signal there had to be this dead space so if you were displaying 1080 you actually transmitted something a bit bigger like 1120 or so, and then the dead pixels didn't get shown. some TVs like to think that anything being sent in is coming from an analog source and needs to be clipped which is annoying
[23:52] <daftykins> ernest_: yeah you can do, see if escott agrees it's a good idea though
[23:53] <ernest_> well i cant find fglrx-legacy in ubuntu software center
=== wbf is now known as initramfshelpwit
[23:53] <daftykins> escott: i figured the fglrx driver would come with a utility to just change the overscan, a-lÃ¡ nvidia-settings with nvidia cards. apparently his radeon 4250 might have been dropped from proprietary though?
[23:53] <kslater> does anyone know where I can turn off this nasty Unity 'help'? (When dragging a window across the screen you'll get a ghosted full-screen outline (orange in my theme), if you let go of the window it goes full screen. I hates it.)

[23:55] <daftykins> ernest_: what about just 'fglrx' ? "apt-cache search fglrx" in a terminal
