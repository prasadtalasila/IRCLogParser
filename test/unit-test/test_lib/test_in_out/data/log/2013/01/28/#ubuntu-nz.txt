[00:49] <thumper> gah...
[00:49] <thumper> couldn't resist replying again on nzoss
[00:49] <thumper> when will I learn?
[00:49]  * thumper goes back to the go tour
[00:52] <ajmitch> thumper: yeah, I don't think it's worth arguing
[00:54] <thumper> ajmitch: probably not
[00:54] <thumper> a person convinced against their will is of the same opinion still
[00:54] <thumper> a nice ditty to remember from time to time
[00:54] <ajmitch> though grant's reply was amusing
[00:54] <thumper> :)
[00:55]  * ajmitch still hasn't used the amazon scope
[00:55] <thumper> me neither
[00:55] <thumper> in fact the last amazon purchase I did was using the amazon app from my ipad
[00:55] <ajmitch> partly because I'm not using unity on quantal, there were performance issues
[00:55] <thumper> perhaps I should feel a little guilty there
[00:56] <thumper> I'm considering upgrading to raring
[00:56] <ajmitch> I might try that also, see if the unredirecting fullscreen windows works well with games now
[00:58] <ibeardslee> I have removed/disable a bunch of lens, primarly for performance and I don't really need to see youtube videos when I start typing in the dash
[00:58] <ibeardslee> when I want to see a youtube vid, I'll go there
[00:59] <thumper> I hardly ever even use the dash
[00:59] <ajmitch> nor do I, I use the launcher mostly & keyboard shortcuts
[01:00] <thumper> I don't even use the hud
[01:00] <thumper> must not be our target market
[01:00] <thumper> at least I managed to stop the hud being called the "intenterface"
[01:00] <ajmitch> that got turned off for me a long time ago :)
[01:00] <ajmitch> hah
[01:00] <ajmitch> that would have been pretty bad
[01:01] <ajmitch> as someone who mostly uses a browser & a terminal, most of the unity features are a bit irrelevant
[01:02] <ajmitch> yet I still like changing easily between different windows in an application, and other easy shortcuts
[01:10] <ibeardslee> oookay .. I thik when a discussion gets to abuse and molestation it is time to stop
[01:10]  * ajmitch goes to tweet about how ubuntu molests users
[01:10] <thumper> heh
[01:46] <Atamira> im thinking of switching from ubuntu to mint
[01:47] <Atamira> tho its still an ubuntu derivative
[01:47] <ajmitch> out of interest, why?
[01:47] <Atamira> not enjoying it atm
[01:47] <ajmitch> that's a bit vague, what do you mean by that?
[01:47] <Atamira> dont like unity. cant find a thing on it
[01:48] <Atamira> not everyone..specially noobs, knwo the names o the programs they wanna use
[01:48] <ajmitch> ok, though you're hardly tied to using unity on ubuntu
[01:48] <Atamira> there is no option to look at other options
[01:48] <ajmitch> as I mentioned above, I don't use it on my desktop
[01:48] <Atamira> true, which is why i went to kde
[01:48] <Atamira> kubuntu
[01:48] <Atamira> its ok..but im not fond of it per se
[01:49]  * ajmitch uses the gnome classic session on quantal
[01:49] <Atamira> i currently flick between kde, xubuntu and xcfe
[01:49] <Atamira> and i get more crashes now than ever
[01:49] <Atamira> vlc will crash deluge and my browser
[01:49] <Atamira> or the browser will crash vlc
[01:49] <ajmitch> sounds a bit suspect
[01:49] <Atamira> and some program called zeigsomething a rather
[01:50] <ajmitch> zeitgeist
[01:50] <Atamira> yeah that
[01:50] <Atamira> every now and then samba restarts itself
[01:50] <Atamira> cant turn off the power saver mode
[01:50] <Atamira> cause when they starts us. it closes all my open programs
[01:50] <Atamira> including irc and deluge
[01:51] <Atamira> i seem to have 2 versions of the same program depending on the manager im using
[01:51] <thumper> Atamira: just a FYI, when you search in the dash for a name, it also searches the tags of the desktop file
[01:51] <Atamira> dont hve the dash
[01:52] <thumper> Atamira: searching for "internet" shows firefox, chromium, skype (although I've installed some of those)
[01:52]  * thumper goes back to ignoring nzoss
[01:52] <Atamira> are you talking about in unity?
[01:52] <thumper> I was, started reading from about 10 minutes ago
[01:52]  * thumper goes back to reading the go language spec
[01:53] <Atamira> ive managed to work around all the crashes, cause right now, dont have time to back up everything on here
[01:54] <ajmitch> I don't know how much mint changes, whether such things would be solved by switching to it
[01:54] <Atamira> i have mint on the laptop
[01:54] <Atamira> i dont have any problems with it
[01:54] <Atamira> wehn im not on the desktop, the kids use it
[01:54] <Atamira> and manage to crash it every single time
[01:54] <ajmitch> but that's completely different hardware
[01:54] <Atamira> yes it is different
[01:55] <Atamira> so no harm in seeing if it will be better on here
[01:55] <ajmitch> might as well try
[01:55] <Atamira> id like to be able to play worldof warcraft again..its just not happening atm
[01:55] <ajmitch> I just wanted to know if you were switching just because of unity
[01:55] <Atamira> well, thats for another day. need another external hdd to back up my data
[01:56]  * ajmitch plays it on 12.10, it works well enough :)
[01:56] <Atamira> no, seeing as i put unity on my mothers, sisters and brother in laws pc's
[01:56] <Atamira> need to keep it around somewhere
[01:57] <Atamira> ive been using ubuntu since the first release
[01:57] <Atamira> neway
[01:58] <Atamira> i need to get some more sleep
[01:58] <Atamira> work tonight
[01:58] <Atamira> enjoy your day guys
[19:45] <thumper> morning
[19:47] <olly> morning
[19:47] <ajmitch> morning
