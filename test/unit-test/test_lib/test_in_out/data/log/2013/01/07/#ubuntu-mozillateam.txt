[18:41] <m_conley> chrisccoulson: ping
[18:41] <chrisccoulson> hi m_conley, how are you? did you have a good christmas and new year?
[18:42] <m_conley> chrisccoulson: I did! Yourself?
[18:42] <chrisccoulson> m_conley, yeah, it was great thanks. but starting to regret taking a whole month off work ;)
[18:42] <m_conley> I also have regrets. Mostly over-eating regrets. I took a hit right in the mirror this year.
[18:42] <m_conley> anywho
[18:42] <chrisccoulson> heh, i'm quite lucky. i didn't do too badly this year :)
[18:43] <m_conley> chrisccoulson: do you know ehsan?
[18:43] <m_conley> on irc.mozilla.org?
[18:43] <chrisccoulson> i do
[18:43] <chrisccoulson> i should probably sign back on to irc.mozilla.org now i'm back at work :)
[18:43] <m_conley> chrisccoulson: he and a few others are working on making per-window private browsing happen
[18:44] <m_conley> chrisccoulson: and ... well, he's got a few questions about the global menu extension
[18:44] <m_conley> I think
[18:44] <m_conley> chrisccoulson: mind signing into irc.mozilla.org in case he wants to ask a question or two?
[18:45] <chrisccoulson> ok, there now :)
[18:46] <m_conley> chrisccoulson: excellent, thanks! :D
[19:02] <chrisccoulson> jdstrand, how much do we care about armel on 12.10?
[19:02] <chrisccoulson> i'm not sure if you noticed that firefox doesn't build there ;)
[19:13] <jdstrand> let me see
[19:14] <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: meh, it is a supported arch. let me look at the build log
[19:15] <micahg> armel on quantal isn't support
[19:15] <micahg> *officially supported
[19:15] <jdstrand> I thought it was
[19:15] <jdstrand> let me check the FAQ again
[19:15] <micahg> it wasn't officially supported in precise....
[19:15] <jdstrand> ah right, 'ports'
[19:15] <jdstrand> it is armhf
[19:15] <jdstrand> (that is supported)
[19:16] <micahg> right, armhf is official on both
[19:16] <jdstrand> still, it build before
[19:16]  * jdstrand looks at build log
[19:16] <jdstrand> yeeow
[19:16] <jdstrand> I'm guessing it won't build without effort
[19:17] <micahg> Mozilla's lowest target at the moment is armv6, so armv5 is oblivious to them
[19:17] <jdstrand> chrisccoulson: let's not worry about it. maybe file an upstream bug and we can get it back next time?
[19:18] <jdstrand> armhf built ok, which I find surprising in a "I didn't think that armel and armhf were that different, but I really don't know what I'm talking about" sort of way
[19:18] <micahg> jdstrand: armv5 vs armv7
[19:19] <jdstrand> huh, I thought it was literally the hardware float bits. oh well
[19:20] <micahg> jdstrand: yes, that's the main difference in precise, with quantal there was the target platform change as well
[19:20]  * jdstrand seems to remember something about buildds have personalities for either. /shrug
[19:20] <jdstrand> micahg: ahh
[19:20] <jdstrand> ok, that makes sense then
