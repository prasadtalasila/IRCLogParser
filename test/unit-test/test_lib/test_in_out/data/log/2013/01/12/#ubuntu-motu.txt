[14:56] <alo21> how can I propose an upgrade of program for Raring?
[14:57] <mitya57> alo21: just file a bug
[14:57] <sladen> alo21: a new upstream version?  Is it in Debian?
[14:59] <alo21> sladen, upstream, and the code is entirely hosted on LP
[14:59] <tumbleweed> alo21: what is it?
[15:00] <alo21> tumbleweed, https://launchpad.net/subdownloader
[15:00] <tumbleweed> alo21: subdownloader is in Debian, so it's preferable to get it updated there
[15:01] <alo21> tumbleweed, I think so... but it take a lot of time
[15:01] <tumbleweed> it doesn't have to
[15:06] <sladen> alo21: here's a previous new upstream version bug for subdownloader in Debian:  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=687126
[15:06] <ubottu> Debian bug 687126 in subdownloader "subdownloader: New version" [Wishlist,Open]
[15:07] <alo21> sladen, yea
[15:08] <tumbleweed> presumably the NMU he prepared is http://mentors.debian.net/package/subdownloader
[15:08] <alo21> sladen, tumbleweed I will talk with maintainer.
[15:09] <tumbleweed> NMUing new upstream versions isn't something we do lightly in Debian
[15:09] <alo21> anyway I thought there is a faster way to upgrade package directly in ubuntu
[15:09] <tumbleweed> but I am in PAPT, and would be happy to do that as a team upload, if it's sane
[15:10] <tumbleweed> alo21: there is, but we don't use it without good reason
[15:10] <tumbleweed> (it only cuts out 12 hours or so, and leaves one with a mess that has to be cleaned up later)
[15:12] <alo21> tumbleweed, hhmmm as you can see in LP there is version 2.0.18. If you would/can port it in Debian you do me a huge pleasure
[15:12] <alo21> tumbleweed, could you?
[15:13] <tumbleweed> alo21: how about you prepare it, and I'll have a look?
[15:14] <alo21> tumbleweed, OK.
[15:14] <alo21> tumbleweed, prepare for debian right?
[15:14] <tumbleweed> yes
[15:15] <alo21> tumbleweed, unstable?
[15:15] <alo21> or testing?
[15:16] <mitya57> not testing!
[15:16] <tumbleweed> uploads in Debian always go to unstable (or experimental)
[15:16] <tumbleweed> in this case, the package isn't even in testing
[15:16] <tumbleweed> so, unstable it is
[15:17] <mitya57> ah, it has an rc bug that will be fixed with the new upstream version (debian bug 606993)
[15:17] <ubottu> Debian bug 606993 in subdownloader "subdownloader: always fail to download selected subs" [Grave,Open] http://bugs.debian.org/606993
[15:17] <tumbleweed> actually, that doesn't appear to be fixed in the new upstream version
[15:17] <tumbleweed> but the package on mentors includes a patch for it
[15:19] <mitya57> the milestone in bug 306589 is set to 2.0.15, and the latest is 2.0.18
[15:19] <ubottu> bug 306589 in subdownloader (Ubuntu) "Error when clicking 'Download' (ascii codec can't encode)" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/306589
[15:19] <tumbleweed> oh, you're right
[15:21] <alo21> tumbleweed, is there some bug (in debian) which request an upgrade to 2.0.18??
[15:21] <tumbleweed> alo21: you can find all the debian bugs here: bugs.debian.org/src:subdownloader
[15:22] <tumbleweed> packages.qa.debian.org/subdownloader is a handy place to find most things about a package in Debian
[15:23] <alo21> tumbleweed, for example this bug (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=687126) is about version 2.0.14-1. Have I set this as fix, even if I will upgrade to 2.0.18?
[15:23]  * mitya57 doesn't think it's worth filing a new "update to new upstream version" bug when one is already open
[15:23] <ubottu> Debian bug 687126 in subdownloader "subdownloader: New version" [Wishlist,Open]
[15:23] <tumbleweed> alo21: yes. mitya57: agreed
[15:26] <alo21> tumbleweed, Have to put LP bug too?
[15:26] <alo21> bugs*
[15:26] <tumbleweed> if you do they'll be automatically closed when it syncs to Ubuntu, so yes, it's a good idea
[15:35] <alo21> tumbleweed, is a problem if changelog's entries are not very human-understandable ?
[15:35] <alo21> tumbleweed, like    search (KeyError: 'MovieImdbRating')
[15:38] <tumbleweed> changelogs are for humans
[15:38] <tumbleweed> so, yes
[16:07] <alo21> tumbleweed, done! what files yo need?
[16:07] <alo21> you*
[16:09] <alo21> do you*
[16:10] <tumbleweed> alo21: how about a diff from the old debian/ directory to the new one?
[16:12] <alo21> tumbleweed, the file will be very heavy
[16:12] <tumbleweed> it shouldn't be
[16:12] <alo21> more than 15 bugs has been fixed
[16:13] <tumbleweed> presumabyl mostly upstream
[16:13] <tumbleweed> (clean the build trees first, obviously)
[16:14] <alo21> where?
[16:15] <tumbleweed> pastebin.debian.net?
[16:16] <alo21> tumbleweed, sorry, but I really did not understand
[16:17] <tumbleweed> alo21: the output of debdiff subdownloader_2.0.14-1.dsc subdownloader_2.0.18-1.dsc | filterdiff -i '*/debian/*'
[16:21] <alo21> tumbleweed, isn't OK if I do debdiff file1.dsc file2.dsc > difference.debdiff?
[16:22] <tumbleweed> well, that'll have lots of stuff that I don't want to see, but sure, I don't mind
[16:22] <alo21> tumbleweed, oh... the command you wrote before is in debian packaging guide?
[16:23] <tumbleweed> probably not
[16:23] <alo21> tumbleweed, may be I am fool, but can I create a diff on Ubuntu machine?
[16:24] <tumbleweed> yes
[16:25] <alo21> tumbleweed, really sorry if I annoying you, but what this command ( subdownloader_2.0.14-1.dsc subdownloader_2.0.18-1.dsc | filterdiff -i '*/debian/*') does?
[16:25] <tumbleweed> I assume you already know what debdiff does?
[16:25] <alo21> yes
[16:25] <tumbleweed> filterdiff filters a diff (in this case, removing everything except the debian directory)
[16:27] <alo21> tumbleweed, so... what you are really interested is debian folder only, because you will grab the source directly from LP. Right?
[16:27] <tumbleweed> yes
[16:29] <tumbleweed> if you look at what we have in PAPT SVN, you'll see it's only the debian directory http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/python-apps/packages/subdownloader/trunk/
[16:29] <alo21> now I really understood. Thanks for your time and explanation
[16:29] <tumbleweed> np (sorry, I try not to explain things too quickly - one learns more finding out for yourself)

[16:38] <alo21> tumbleweed, could you give me the entire command, please?
[16:39] <tumbleweed> I did earlier:
[16:39] <tumbleweed> debdiff  subdownloader_2.0.14-1.dsc  subdownloader_2.0.18-1.dsc | filterdiff -i  '*/debian/*'
[16:41] <alo21> tumbleweed, sorry, I missed a character... here is the output (http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1524136/)
[16:42] <alo21> I hope is OK
[16:42] <tumbleweed> I see what you mean about lots of bugs
[16:47] <mitya57> alo21: did you read http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=639003#10 ?
[16:47] <ubottu> Debian bug 639003 in subdownloader "should depend on python-qt4" [Important,Open]
[16:49] <alo21> mitya57, without this python-qt4 the program never start
[16:50] <mitya57> alo21: doesn't it have a command-line interface?
[16:50] <alo21> mitya57, yes it has
[16:50] <mitya57> so, it will start :)
[16:51] <mitya57> you can also read the suggestion in the next command
[16:51] <mitya57> *comment
[16:53] <alo21> mitya57, I read it, in fact there is the same bug in LP, I will try to fix the bug later. But not now
[16:54] <alo21> mitya57, but you right...
[16:55] <alo21> may be I have to put back python-qt as recommends
[16:58] <alo21> mitya57, sorry... I leave it as depends... and I try to make double binary package as soon as possible.
[16:59] <mitya57> alo21: thanks
=== al-maisan is now known as almaisan-away
[17:01] <alo21> mitya57, I explain why... if I put python-qt as recommend, most of the people would start the gui without knowing that subdownloader will never work without python-qt package, and they think is a bug
[17:02] <mitya57> "most of the people" will have python-qt4 installed as it's in recommends
[17:03] <alo21> mitya57, if python-qt4 is as recommend, the package will never installed automatically
[17:04] <mitya57> alo21: all tools I know (u-s-c, apt(itude), synaptic) install recommended packages by default
[17:05] <alo21> mitya57, hhhmmm... if is as you said.... why someone fill that big? it is weird
[17:06] <tumbleweed> alo21: you shouldn't need debian/dirs. debian/subdownloader-cli.install is totally unused. you shouldn't need subdownloader.postinst (which is currentnly pretty weird)
[17:07] <tumbleweed> (and yes, this package is currently not the prettiest package)
[17:10] <alo21> tumbleweed, I didn't set up the package (debian folder). I just fixed some bugs. Anyway I would like that you (if you want) make a re-stylish
[17:11] <alo21> tumbleweed, or you could get in touch with Marco Rodriguez
[17:11] <alo21> the debian maintainer
[17:12] <alo21> and talk about it
[17:12] <tumbleweed> alo21: I'm not suggesting you make it prettier, I'm just talking about changes you made
[17:22] <alo21> tumbleweed, OK. subdownloader-cli can be deleted. But I didn't make any changes in .postinst and debian/dirs
[17:23] <alo21> or I didn't create them
[17:23] <tumbleweed> alo21: your patch says you did
[17:24] <alo21> tumbleweed, the debdiff?
[17:24] <tumbleweed> yeah
[17:25] <alo21> tumbleweed, I am not the only developer.. may be someone else did it. Let me check something..
[17:27] <alo21> tumbleweed, in fact, for example .postinstall file has been chnages by Ivan Garcia
[17:28] <tumbleweed> alo21: how did you get it then? it's not in the tarball provided by the upstream
[17:29] <alo21> tumbleweed, are you talking about: https://launchpad.net/subdownloader/trunk/2.0.18  ?
[17:31] <tumbleweed> alo21: https://launchpad.net/subdownloader/trunk/2.0.18/+download/subdownloader_2.0.18.orig.tar.gz
[17:32] <tumbleweed> anyway, we almost never take debian packaging from the upstream. we ignore their packaging and do our own
[17:33]  * tumbleweed goes out for a bit
[17:35] <alo21> this is because I took the source form the trunk, not from the link above, and may be the files are a little bit different
