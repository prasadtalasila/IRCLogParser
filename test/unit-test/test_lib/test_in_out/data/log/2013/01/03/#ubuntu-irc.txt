[16:56] <tsimpson> TheLordOfTime: they should probably come to a decision, then the IRCC can help with the technical side of things
[16:57] <tsimpson> though, the IRCC would probably be happy to give any advice required to make a decision
[19:21] <TheLordOfTime> tsimpson, was a proposal to merge -bugs and -quality, both sides of the email chain said "no", so no need to follow up with IRCC.
[19:21] <TheLordOfTime> thanks though.
[19:25] <AlanBell> TheLordOfTime: well if nobody wants to merge them then wouldn't it be best to not merge them?
[19:26] <TheLordOfTime> AlanBell, isn't that what I said?
[19:26] <TheLordOfTime> both sides of the email chain said "no", so no need to follow up with IRCC. <--
[19:26] <AlanBell> ah, sorry I read that backwards :)
[19:26] <TheLordOfTime> no problem.
