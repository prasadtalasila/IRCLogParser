[16:56] <TheLordOfTime> jbicha, how much do you know about packaging
[16:56] <TheLordOfTime> and ubuntu revision numbers for non-security bugs?
[16:58]  * TheLordOfTime pokes jbicha
[17:02] <jbicha> the SRU team generally prefers using the same version numbering you'd use for security bugs
[17:03] <TheLordOfTime> jbicha, that's what i thought, thanks.
[17:04] <jbicha> or maybe that's the security team that didn't like my version numbering
[17:04] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[17:04] <TheLordOfTime> i tend to listen to security team numbering
[17:04] <TheLordOfTime> it hasn't killed me yet.  :P
