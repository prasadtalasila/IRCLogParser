[06:50] <Mcgiwer> hello
[07:00] <Mcgiwer> I have found some bugs with may be critical
[07:01] <Mcgiwer> they are for Ubuntu 12
[07:11] <tsimpson> !bug | Mcgiwer
[07:11] <ubot2> Mcgiwer: If you find a bug in Ubuntu or any of its derivatives, please file a bug using the command « ubuntu-bug <package> » - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs for other ways to report bugs.
[07:18] <Mcgiwer> the problem is that I'm using an emergency Linux to access internet and I'm not having any kind of access to ubuntu-bug

[10:17] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1079801 in mesa (Ubuntu) "RESOLVED: mysterious application behaviour for the intel "sandy bridge" hardware" [Undecided,New]
[10:17] <Teufelchen> a broken hdd was the problem in the end
[10:17] <Teufelchen> and i decided to stop using Google Earth and Second Life
[10:17] <Teufelchen> so the bug can be closed
[10:30] <jibel> Teufelchen, if you're the original reporter you can close it as invalid
[10:31] <Teufelchen> but its not invalid its just resolved
[10:32] <Teufelchen> the bug exists
[10:32] <Teufelchen> so the report is valid
[10:33] <Teufelchen> maybe it applies to other users aswell
[10:33] <Teufelchen> but maybe i should rename it

[10:34] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1079801 in mesa (Ubuntu) "RESOLVED: applications like Google Earth or Second Life do not work" [Undecided,New]
[10:34] <Teufelchen> better title?
[10:35] <Teufelchen> i keep the bug open then in case i ever plan to use these applications again
[10:35] <Teufelchen> the compatibility was broken by introducing newer kernels and newer software packages
[10:36] <Teufelchen> e.g. mesa
[10:36] <Teufelchen> but since nobody helps me to troubleshoot a true solution will be impossible to find
[10:37] <Teufelchen> maybe i have to use windows 7 for certain applications
[10:37] <Teufelchen> would be no true solution either but still a step forward
[10:39] <jibel> Teufelchen, my understanding of the bug is that it is not resolved since you still have problems with google earth and second life, so the right status would be confirmed
[10:40] <Teufelchen> okay, thank you
[10:40] <jibel> but as penguin42 said in comment #11 it looks more like a pb with second life and google earth than ubuntu
[11:03] <Teufelchen> no
[11:03] <Teufelchen> because -
[11:03] <Teufelchen> these applications work on older state Ubuntu 12.04 while they do not work on newer releases
[11:06] <jibel> did they update their packaging for the latest version of ubuntu?
[11:07] <Teufelchen> maybe roll a dice to make out whether linden lab and google or canonical brought in the incompatibility
[11:19] <jibel> Teufelchen, wrt. google earth according to this post http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/12/google-earth-for-linux-signal-11-fix-coming google provided a fix in rev 7.0.1.8283
[11:19] <jibel> but I cannot install it on raring, there are missing dependencies
[11:21] <Teufelchen> yeah
[11:21] <Teufelchen> something is seriously broken
[11:21] <Teufelchen> cause on ubuntu 12.04 it auto-installs what it needs
[11:22] <jibel> after forcing the installation of a couple of deps, google earth works fine on raring/i386
[11:23] <jibel> almost, there are some textures missing
[11:31] <Teufelchen> the question is - do you have the intel integrated graphics chip or not
[11:36] <jibel> I do
[12:13] <Teufelchen> raring is 13.04 right?
[12:14] <Teufelchen> i deleted it when 12.10 and 13.04 (early stage) did not work
[12:15] <Teufelchen> maybe i should test install again

[21:49] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, hggdh, either of you around?
[21:49] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, on further looking at this bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/etckeeper/+bug/1095180  it appears that 'sudo' is whwat breaks the bash completion of etckeeper... what defines sudo's tab-complete functionality?
[21:49] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1095180 in etckeeper (Ubuntu) "incorrect bash-completion" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[21:49] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, ^
[21:49] <TheLordOfTime> (you both commented on this at the time i first brought it up)
[21:56] <yofel> bash-completion has a sudo wrapper which calls the completion of the command that you try to run with sudo
[21:56] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, then is this a bug in bash-completion?
[21:56] <TheLordOfTime> rather than a bug in etckeeper.
[21:57] <TheLordOfTime> since the tab completion works fine as long as sudo is not used.
[21:57] <TheLordOfTime> its when you add sudo at the beginning that it fails
[21:58] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: well. bash completion is for the command being executed. In this case, the command is 'sudo', not 'whatever', so -- my guess -- is that it would require the 'sudo' bash completion to be extended to support a recursive call
[21:59] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, so this should be filed/refiled/added-to the bash-completion package for the bug?
[21:59] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: so, if this has not been considered by the developers of bash-completion for sudo, it looks like a wishlist
[21:59] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, should I check with bash-completion upstream first?
[21:59] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: just change the package to sudo
[22:00] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: it is always a good idea
[22:00] <yofel> sudo has bash completion
[22:00] <hggdh> yofel: for the command being called also?
[22:00] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, but not afaict recursive bash completion - its the sudo bash completion for etckeeper that fails.
[22:00] <yofel> yeah, try running 'sudo apport-cli -<tab>' for example
[22:01] <hggdh> yes
[22:01] <yofel> TheLordOfTime: yeah, but I'm not quite sure whose fault that is
[22:01] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, so, add the 'bash-completion' package or whatever package, then see which one says it is/isn't valid for them?
[22:01] <TheLordOfTime> (if they say its invalid for both then we have a problem...)
[22:01] <hggdh> heh
[22:02]  * yofel reads the script right now
[22:02] <hggdh> it might even be both, I do not know how -completion works in this case. But we can always look at the code
[22:02] <TheLordOfTime> this may be one of those reeally really weird edge-case bugs which nobody knows how to handle... :P
[22:02] <TheLordOfTime> ... just saying
[22:02] <yofel> nah, I'll agree there...
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> yofel, agree on... this being one of those weird bugs where we don't know what to do with it?
[22:10] <TheLordOfTime> or agree on hggdh's statement that it could be both packages?
[22:10]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[22:10] <yofel> I'll agree with hggdh for now
[22:10] <yofel> _command_offset() is too cryptic for any quick debugging
[22:10] <yofel> (that's what shifts the completion for sudo)
[22:11] <TheLordOfTime> so then it wouldn't hurt to add bash-completion to the bug?
[22:11] <TheLordOfTime> (i'm assuming that's our consensus)
[22:13] <yofel> go ahead, worst case one can remove the task later
[22:16] <TheLordOfTime> bash-completion is both the binary package and the source package, right?
[22:16]  * TheLordOfTime never knows unless he goes to packages.ubuntu.com and looks, but he can't on a mobile connection
[22:17] <TheLordOfTime> nevermind, found it out myself :P
[22:21] <hggdh> cool
[22:21] <TheLordOfTime> in the meantime, i've added bash-completion to that bug, we'll see where it ends up
[22:22] <TheLordOfTime> thanks, hggdh and yofel.  :)
