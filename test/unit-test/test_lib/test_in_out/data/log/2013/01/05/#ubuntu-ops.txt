[00:19] <Jordan_U> ikonia: I'm willing to believe that there is a correlation between unstable Windows installations and installing Windows after Ubuntu, though the causality pretty clearly wouldn't be what they claim.
[00:20] <ikonia> to be honest, the only time I see this is with people not doing their home work
[00:21] <ikonia> I've never seen this, the people I interact with daily don't have this problem,
[00:21] <ikonia> every time I've seen this complaint it's been user error/lack of planning
[00:21] <ikonia> and I don't like people blaming windows for their lack of planning/research
[00:22] <Jordan_U> Completely agreed.
[02:02] <Transhumanist> ikonia: I've been talking to jamie_ and helping him through partition management with Gparted so he can dual-boot Ubuntu and Windows. If I hadn't of, he would've just ditched Ubuntu given his frustration and bad experiences in this channel. This isn't a Windows support channel, but nor do you need to kick somebody for wanting to dual-boot. His problem was Windows not recognising ext3.
