[00:02] <cjwatson> Seriously?  celeryd log rotation interrupts any branches being scanned at the time?
[00:03] <cjwatson> Oh, no, there it goes
[00:03] <wgrant> It wouldn't surprise me.
[00:03] <cjwatson> Just exceptionally confusing log output
[00:04] <cjwatson> (It starts up another poolworker of the same name, I think)

[00:13] <cjwatson> Aha, https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/i386/man-db et al is what I'm looking for
[00:13] <cjwatson> I always find that tremendously difficult to locate
[00:16] <wgrant> cjwatson: Yeah, I've never been sure how to get there without URL hacking
[00:16] <wgrant> I believe there is a way
[00:17] <wgrant> But like https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/+package/man-db it is rather difficult to find
[00:17] <cjwatson> That's what I always go for first and it's much less useful (to me anyway)
[00:18] <cjwatson> https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/raring/i386 has a search box that times out a lot
[00:18] <cjwatson> Maybe it would return something useful if it ever succeeded
[00:18] <cjwatson> Hm, no, takes me to the DASBPR
[00:19] <cjwatson> The package relationship links on DASBPR:+index go to DASBP:+index, though
[00:19] <cjwatson> So that's one way, albeit convoluted
[00:26] <wgrant> Yeah
[00:26] <wgrant> By DASBP you mean DSBP?
[00:26] <wgrant> Ah, no
[00:26] <wgrant> Nevermind
[00:27] <cjwatson> I don't think so
[03:11] <wgrant> StevenK: How's the rewrite?
[03:12] <StevenK> Painful
[03:13] <wgrant> Think of all the code you can delete
[03:13] <StevenK> Not sure I'm at all happy with it
[03:13] <StevenK> % bzr di | diffstat -s
[03:13] <StevenK>  10 files changed, 266 insertions(+), 423 deletions(-)
[03:13] <wgrant> And that's just the start :)
[03:14] <cody-somerville> StevenK: whatcha doin'?
[03:14]  * wgrant breaks the build farm
[03:14] <StevenK> cody-somerville: Rewriting specification search
[03:18] <StevenK> As well as questioning my sanity as of 4:30pm yesterday.
[03:19] <wgrant> What did you do?
[03:21] <StevenK> 4:30pm is approximately when I talked myself into starting specificationsearch.
[03:21] <wgrant> Heh
[03:21] <StevenK> wgrant: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/1543444/
[03:27] <wgrant> :)
[03:31] <StevenK> Oh, so you don't wildly object?
[03:31] <StevenK> % subunit-stats < lp.log | grep Failed
[03:31] <StevenK> Failed tests:     93
[03:31] <StevenK> Hmmm
[03:32] <wgrant> It's a good start
[03:32] <wgrant> Even better once the tests pass!
[03:33] <wgrant> Removing this duplication can only be a good thing
[03:33] <StevenK> I've not done {Distro,Product}Series either
[03:38] <wgrant> StevenK: What about ProjectGroup?
[03:39] <wgrant> I didn't really look at the deletion bits of the diff hard enough to notice
[03:39] <StevenK> ProjectGroup has been subsumed
[03:39] <wgrant> Ah
[03:58] <StevenK> % testr failing --list | wc -l
[03:58] <StevenK> 46
[03:59] <wgrant> What sort of failurs?
[04:03] <StevenK> Most of them have been thinko/things I missed while shifting tons of code around
[04:07] <wgrant> Right :)
[04:08] <StevenK> % testr failing --list | wc -l
[04:08] <StevenK> 26
[04:22] <StevenK> Progress!
[04:22] <StevenK> % testr failing --list | wc -l
[04:22] <StevenK> 11
[04:23]  * StevenK sighs at the specification code using 'filter' everywhere, which neatly masks an internal function
[04:30] <wgrant> Huh
[04:30] <wgrant> I didn't break buildbot
[04:30] <wgrant> Incredible

[17:56] <Bert_2> Hi, I sort of forgot how I can change the number of e.g. blueprints there are displayed on a project's blueprintspage per page, anyone know this by hard cause I couldn't find it using grep
[18:01] <Bert_2> s/hard/heart/
[18:01] <Bert_2> woops
[18:03] <cjwatson> ?batch=50
[18:04] <cjwatson> (etc.)  but if you raise it too high it will probably time out
[18:04] <cjwatson> ah, or tell you that the maximum is 300
[18:04] <Bert_2> cjwatson: and where do I set that?
[18:06] <cjwatson> at the end of the URL
[18:06] <Bert_2> cjwatson: but that's not a permanent solution now is it
[18:06] <Bert_2> I was able to raise it from 10 to 20 before
[18:06] <Bert_2> but I don't remember how the hell I did that xD
[18:07] <cjwatson> wait, is this your own LP instance?
[18:07] <Bert_2> cjwatson: yeah
[18:07] <cjwatson> it would be helpful to say that rather than making us guess :P
[18:07] <Bert_2> yeah sorry, I guessed you'd expect that based on the fact this is the dev chanel, sorry man
[18:08] <cjwatson> it's default_batch_size in launchpad-lazr.conf
[18:10] <Bert_2> cjwatson: awesome, thx :D
[18:10] <Bert_2> so silly I couldn't remember
[18:10] <Bert_2> thought it was in some template, so I went looking there
