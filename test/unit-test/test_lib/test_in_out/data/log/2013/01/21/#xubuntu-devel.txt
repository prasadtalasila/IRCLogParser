[01:17] <micahg> knome: new needed dependencies mostly
[02:05] <micahg> knome: there are probably a few things we can drop, but idk if I can get us back to CD size on amd64 without dropping more functionality
[02:05] <micahg> I'll keep trying though
[02:24] <micahg> knome: mr_pouit: ochosi: do we need gtk2-engines if we have gtk2-engines-murrine and gtk2-engines-pixbuf
[09:29] <FlowRiser> hey all, i have a question regarding deploying a app to the xfce desktop environment. I want to make a qt/qml launcher for the xfce desktop environment, how can i make my app behave like the xfce4-panel ?
[09:46] <FlowRiser> knome ? Can i get your opinion on the above question ? :D
[10:48] <mr_pouit> micahg: I think murrine+pixbuf is enough
[14:14] <micahg> do we need the tango icon theme?
[15:11] <ochosi> micahg: i don't think so, hicolor and elementary-xfce should suffice
[15:11] <micahg> ochosi: ok, dropping, thanks
[15:11] <ochosi> micahg: but i can check again to be sure ;)
[15:12] <ochosi> wait, i don't even have that installed, are you talking about 12.04 or 12.10?
[15:12] <micahg> ochosi: heh, we already dropped that, I was looking at an old revision
[15:12] <ochosi> yeah
[15:13] <ochosi> cause that was one of the targets of the previous release, being able to get rid of the gnome and tango-icon-themes
