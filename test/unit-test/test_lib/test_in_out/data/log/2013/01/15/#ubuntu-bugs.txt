[15:39] <om26er> What is the general feel if I announce a bug day for thursday to be focused on triaging  Transmission BT ?
[15:47] <hggdh> om26er: I see no problem. It will have to be blogged about, of course
[15:47] <om26er> hggdh, should I use my blog which syndicates to Planet or is there any specific blog ?
[15:48] <om26er> and ofcourse also announce on the mailing list
[15:48] <hggdh> om26er: Planet is good, and emails to bugsquad, -control, and whoever else you feel would be interested. And thank you :-)
[15:49] <jibel> there is no specific blog for bug days
[15:51] <om26er> hggdh, alright, I will do that, first I am talking with the upstream developer of transmission about how best we can collaborate
[15:52] <hggdh> perfect!
[15:53] <jibel> om26er, just in case you didn't find it already, this page gives guidelines to organize a bug day: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBugDay/Organizing I don't know if everything is still up to date though
[15:55] <hggdh> pedro_: ^ would you help om26er ?
[16:01] <om26er> jibel, thanks for that, also last i had a chat with persia we were mutually inclined towards not having a wiki page showing bugs, "just jump to launchpad and triage" was discussed, how do you feel about that
[16:01] <om26er> hggdh, ^
[16:02] <om26er> though we can still follow other procedures from the above link
[16:03] <hggdh> om26er: I think both approaches would work. The idea behind the wiki page was to make easier to jot down which bugs have been seen, and who worked on them. But this can also be had from LP itself
[16:04] <jibel> om26er, I think some people, especially newcomers, need guidance and list of bugs can help when you don't really know where to start
[16:04] <jibel> om26er, but for more experienced triagers or people who know a package well, I agree bug lists are superfluous
[16:05] <jibel> also bug list have the advantage to set a measurable goal
[16:05] <jibel> which is more difficult to measure with package with loads of bugs
[16:06] <om26er> jibel, lets see how well the bug day tool is working or even working
[16:06] <jibel> it might be a bit frustrating to say, "Great work you triaged 32 bugs amongst 12345 bugs for this package" :)
[16:08] <jibel> psivaa, can you help with SRU verification of bug 1097907 ?
[16:08] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1097907 in update-manager (Ubuntu Quantal) "Cannot upgrade from quantal (12.10) to raring (13.04)" [Critical,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1097907
[16:10] <om26er> fun, ubuntu-qa-tools package was never uploaded after Natty so the problem is that we can't use something like ' hugday close BUGNUMBER'
[16:10] <psivaa> jibel: sure, it fix has been just committed, ill try in a couple of hours if thats ok
[16:10] <om26er> would need everyone to edit the wikipage
[16:11] <jibel> it wouldn't work well obviously :/
[16:11] <jibel> psivaa, thanks
[16:11] <psivaa> jibel: yw

[22:06] <jarlath> As of a few days ago, choosing "Shutdown" from the little cog now takes me to the login screen instead of shutting down. Is this familiar to anyone? There are no other logged in users.
[22:09] <jarlath> I have an idea. Brb.
[22:25] <jarlath> Okay, the commands work from the greeter menu *before* I log into an account. After I log in to any account, I can't do it from the cog-menu or even the greeter when I log out. I'm not performing any actions in the account during this test. What could be happening as the session starts to cause this?
