[11:44] <PatrickDickey> Just wanted to pop in and say hi. And to let you know, that if you're in the #ubuntu channel, and type !manual the bot gives a link to our manual. :D
[11:49] <CarstenG> Hi Patrick
[11:49] <CarstenG> Nice to see you :-)
[11:49] <CarstenG> !manual
[12:02] <PatrickDickey> Nice to see you too CarstenG.
[12:02] <PatrickDickey> Any word on when we'll be starting the Raring manual, or are we going to wait for the next LTS?
[12:03] <CarstenG> We will do a version for raring.
[12:03] <CarstenG> But I don't know when we start
[12:04] <CarstenG> I think Kevin will organize a meeting for it.
[12:05] <CarstenG> The raring branch is already started and can be used.
[12:07] <CarstenG> The next LTS will be 14.04, or?
[12:25] <CarstenG> Hi Sylvie
[12:35] <cqfd93> Hi Carsten!
[13:26] <PatrickDickey> I'll have to install it on my laptop. I decided to go with lubuntu on my desktop.
[13:33] <CarstenG> you mean raring?
[13:43] <CarstenG> Hi Thorsten.
[13:43] <CarstenG> See you all.
[13:43] <CarstenG> Bye
