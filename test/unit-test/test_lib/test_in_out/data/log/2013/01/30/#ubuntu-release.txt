[11:27] <ogra_> there is a brcm-patchram-plus  in raring source NEW, it makes (or is supposed to make) BT work on the nexus7, would be great if that could be reviewed soon
[11:48] <seb128> ogra_, seems ok, but shouldn't the source contain the license's text? e.g have a COPYING with the apache license?
=== mmrazik is now known as mmrazik|afk
[11:52] <ogra_> seb128, debian/copyright points to "/usr/share/common-licenses/Apache-2.0"
[11:52] <ogra_> i think thats enough, iirc we only need to ship the full license if there is nothing in /usr/share/common-licenses/
=== mmrazik|afk is now known as mmrazik
[12:20] <ogra_> cjwatson, (or anyone else familiar with sysvinit ) .... i'd like a quick glance over http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589449/ before i upload
[12:22] <ogra_> (it is tested and works on the nx7)
[12:22] <cjwatson> what if /sys/module/cpu_tegra3 doesn't exist?
[12:22] <cjwatson> this script's architecture-independent
[12:23] <ogra_> so i should add tests for every line ?
[12:23]  * ogra_ does so
[12:24] <ogra_> hmpf, that gets bulky
[12:24] <cjwatson> I think it's OK to assume that the interactive governor entries exist
[12:24] <cjwatson> I don't know about cpuidle
[12:25] <cjwatson> "if [ -d /sys/module/cpu_tegra3 ]; then ...; fi" around the two cpu_tegra3 entries seems to make sense to me?
[12:25] <ogra_> yup
[12:25] <cjwatson> You could sort the entries while you're at it
[12:27] <seb128> cjwatson, brcm-patchram-plus in NEW is a simple debian-native style package with one .c file under apache license ... does the source needs to contain the apache license text?
[12:28] <ogra_> debian/copyright points to "/usr/share/common-licenses/Apache-2.0" ...
[12:28] <seb128> ogra_, well, my understanding (and what I've applied to far for NEWing) is that the license needs to be distributed with the source
[12:29] <ogra_> right, mine always was that this only applies to licenses not in /usr/share/common-licenses
[12:29] <cjwatson> If it's in common-licenses, and the situation is clear, it's normally fine for it to be referenced in debian/copyright
[12:30] <cjwatson> We don't need to police upstream's licence distribution practices; we only need to ensure that we're meeting our obligations ourselves
[12:30] <seb128> ogra_, I got uploaded rejected in Debian because the LGPL was not included in the upstream tarball IIRC (and it's in common-licenses)
[12:30] <cjwatson> And distribution in common-licenses is enough
[12:30] <seb128> uploads*
[12:30] <xnox> seb128: source upstream tarball typically should have a full license text, debian binary packages can simply have a pointer to /usr/share/common-licenses.
[12:31] <seb128> well, anyway, I just wanted to check
[12:31] <cjwatson> xnox: it is not our job to police the contents of upstream tarballs
[12:31] <seb128> ogra_, NEWed
[12:31] <seb128> cjwatson, thanks
[12:31] <ogra_> seb128, well, debian ...
[12:31] <ogra_> :)
[12:31] <cjwatson> seb128: I can't speak for every Debian ftp-master, but that doesn't fall under the various things in REJECT-FAQ
[12:31] <seb128> cjwatson, maybe I remember wrongly or maybe some ftpmaster are picky about that ... anyway, thanks for the clarification!
[12:32] <cjwatson> seb128: There has to be either an indication in the upstream tarball of the licence that the copyright holder(s) intended, or a description of how we figured out what the licence was
[12:32] <cjwatson> ("License II" in REJECT-FAQ)
[12:33] <cjwatson> Of course, it might still be a good idea to contact upstream and get them to spell out the licensing more clearly in their tarball
[12:33] <cjwatson> I just don't think it's cause for rejection
[12:35] <seb128> noted, thanks
[12:37] <ogra_> hmm, how do i pull that into the image now
[12:37] <ogra_> i guess a dep from ubuntu-defaults-nexus7 will do
[12:40] <seb128> ogra_, binNEWed as well
[12:43] <ogra_> cjwatson, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589513/
[12:50] <cjwatson> ogra_: LGTM
[12:50] <ogra_> great, uploading
[13:08] <tjaalton> I've done a clean install of 12.10, then ran dist-upgrade and rebooted. after that I enabled fglrx and rebooted again, noticing that unity didn't run because the fglrx module wasn't built
[13:08] <tjaalton> the reason for that was that while linux-headers-generic got upgraded, it didn't pull the new headers package
[13:09] <tjaalton> so I did 'apt-get --fix-policy install', which did pull the new headers and a bunch of others, like ecryptfs-utils
[13:10] <tjaalton> also, linux-generic isn't installed on the system, although dpkg.log shows it being installed during image build
[13:10] <tjaalton> same for the ecryptfs stuff
[13:14] <tjaalton> so the question is, is it normal?
[13:28] <cjwatson> tjaalton: there's a known bug in the quantal installer that some of the kernel metapackages were mistakenly uninstalled - bug 1070427

[19:39] <balloons> infinity, so I went to verify this bug -- i don't see a package in -proposed for it. https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/precise/+source/empathy/+bug/1018504
[19:39] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 1018504 in empathy (Fedora) "Empathy doesn't display buddy list" [Undecided,New]
[19:41] <balloons> som the changelog doesn't show that it went in.. however the fix was backported from upstream: http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/e/empathy/empathy_3.4.2.3-0ubuntu1/changelog
[19:41] <balloons> d'oh.. wrong changelog
[19:45] <balloons> hmm.. ok, so telepathy-glib0 never saw an update -- ahh, that's the upgrade
[20:15] <infinity> balloons: It wasn't empathy, it was telepathy.  The bug's mistargeted.
[20:15] <balloons> infinity, yes I think it's sorted now
[20:32] <infinity> balloons: Ugh, and if people had just done the right bug paperwork, I wouldn't have had to bug you.  There was another bug (without a precise task) that someone has verified months ago.  Grr.
[20:32] <balloons> it's ok.. like I said, I thought it had gotten in and everything was taken care of
[20:32] <balloons> I actually looked at that last year again in Nov when it was pinged again
[20:33] <balloons> anyways.. let me know if I can do anything else to help
[20:33] <infinity> balloons: I'm releasing it now, so not much more you can do for that bug. :P
[20:33] <balloons> hehe
[20:33] <balloons> good
[20:34] <infinity> balloons: But we're driving toward 12.04.2, if you want to get together hordes of testers to throw at dailies.
[20:34] <infinity> balloons: Between the new kernel/X enablement stacks and SecureBoot, there's something there to break for everyone.
[20:34] <balloons> I know.. I was thinking about asking.. it's only going to be the dailies then -- no milestone at all?
[20:35] <balloons> I believe slangesk answered me on it a few weeks ago when I asked saying so
[20:36] <cjwatson> 12.04.2 will be the milestone
[20:36] <cjwatson> I posted a note to ubuntu-devel-announce a few days ago with the rough schedule for candidate images and such
[20:37] <infinity> balloons: Yeah, the milestone will appear soon enough.  But early testing never hurts.  Especially in the face of massive changes that we may need last-minute fixes for.
[20:37] <balloons> cjwatson, ahh, ok good
[20:37] <balloons> that's saner, I missed your annouce then
[20:37]  * balloons goes to look
