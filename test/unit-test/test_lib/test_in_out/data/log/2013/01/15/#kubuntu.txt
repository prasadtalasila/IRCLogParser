[00:59] <doughball> When I open an application, the application's icon appears next to my mouse and a place holder window appears in the task manager; how or where can I disable/modify that behavior?
[01:11] <skreech__> doughball: launch notification ?
[01:11] <doughball> skreech__: thanks, let me try and find it
[01:11] <skreech__> doughball: alt+f2 -> launch
[01:11] <doughball> skreech__: Ah ha, `launch feedback`, in `application and system notifications`.
[01:11] <skreech__> Yeah that works too :)
[01:11] <doughball> I wonder if it is possible to disable that effect for only certain applications?
[01:13] <skreech__> I'm going to off the top of my head say no. Then be proven wrong somehow
[01:13] <skreech__> But really I don't think you can. What's the use case for that?
[01:13] <doughball> I setup a custom keyboard event to pause a wine media player via command line, but the Launch Feedback effects also activate, despite no windows actually opening
[01:15] <skreech__> Oh that's kinda annoying
[01:15] <skreech__> I would guess it's passing somethign on to wine so yeah I can see that triggering a new application
[01:16] <doughball> really, disabling the taskbar notification will work, because the python editor idle wouldn't dismiss the notification when it created its window
[01:16] <doughball> *in addition, i mean. It will solve two problems
[01:17] <OpenSorce> OMFG!! What process causes screen blanking?!? I not only want to stop it I *may* apt-get remove it
[01:18] <OpenSorce> I am running TWO screensaver inhibitors, I run xset with the -dpms s off and s noblank options and it STILL blanks my screen every 5 minutes
[01:22] <doughball> OpenSorce: try checking `Display and Monitor` > `Screen Saver`, and `Power Managerment` > `Energy Saving` > `Screen Energy Saving` options within the main System Settings window
[01:22] <Scunizi_> knotify4 is eating my ram.. it's at 3 gigs and climbing.. why?
[01:23] <Scunizi_> Could it be something in kdenlive that's triggered it?
[01:25] <skreech__> Could be the monitor has it built in
[01:25] <skreech__> No pixel change instruction in Xtime period? Power save!
[01:25] <skreech__> though that does sound stupid
[01:31] <OpenSorce> doughball, did all that first. I also have Unity installed, I guess it could be something in there

[08:06] <Kottizen> Hi. I've added the microblogging plasmoid to my desktop and connected it to Twitter, but it doesn't look like it's really working. What should I do? http://simplest-image-hosting.net/png-0-dt6590

[09:19] <Vilex> my updatemanager ask me update and when i try update it says somthing update-sun-jre cant update? Anyone same problem?
[09:20] <tasslehoff> I'm an avid xmonad user playing with kde. Is there an application/plugin that can give me similar control over window placement/size with keyboard shortcuts?
[09:23] <Vilex> i thing my problem solved when i manualy update oracle java is that right?
[09:35] <Vilex> then i have other more bigger problem my kubuntu start crash and always not load up when i start computer. I thing my hard drive is going break up?
[09:39] <TheOneRing> hey just installed kubuntu 12.10 on my tablet, and then installed the kubuntu-active package, which packages do I have to install to make the whole thing work?
[09:39] <TheOneRing> and is there a plasma-active 3 ppa?
[09:39] <gdr> hi guys. I woke up today, Booted my computer and found out that lower case "B" letter doesn't work on my keyBoard anymore. It's kde-only, it works when I do ctrl-alt-f1 (and, strangely, in psi). I didn't change any kB-related settings, it must have Been some recent update...
[09:40] <Tm_T> TheOneRing: AFAIK kubuntu-active is enough, for latter I do not know
[09:41] <sbivol_> gdr: I saw that in a 13.04 virtual machine
[09:42] <Tm_T> gdr: on which release you are on?
[09:42] <sbivol_> gdr: but it was a server install, without KDE, so it is not related to KDE
[09:42] <gdr> it's 12.04 - and it works in the console
[09:42] <gdr> By console i mean real console, not konsole/xterm
[09:44] <sbivol_> gdr: the cause in my case was that the filesystem was severely damaged (a clone from a failed USB drive) and many system files were simply missing
[09:45] <gdr> sBivol: no fs related errors in kern.log
[09:47] <sbivol_> gdr: I'd still advise to do a fsck from a liveCD, or even a „badblocks -n /dev/sda”
[09:47] <gdr> well, good idea. and i just realized it could Be Broken ecryptfs in my home directory too
[09:49] <sbivol_> gdr: having your home dir messed up wouldn't break the keyboard, but you never know :)
[09:50] <gdr> well if a keymap is damaged anything could happen
[09:51] <gdr> ok, thank you for your help, I'll  reBooting then
[09:51] <sbivol_> gdr: hmmm... that is true. then you could simply create another user to test that
[09:59] <TheOneRing> Tm_T: hm still missing the virtual keyboard
[10:22] <yongha> So if we install something, where is the source located in the tree? For example, valgrind or tf
[10:27] <yongha> I guess the better question would be, does the source come with the package or do I have to get it individually for each one I want to look at?
[10:28] <gdr> sbivol_: i fixed the "b" problem. it looks like it wasn't kde but psi+ - it only happened when psi+ was running, and I have it autostarted. Thank you anyway.
[10:32] <puneet> hi...is there any way that I could share my netconnect internet on my android phone ?
[10:32] <puneet> like the way I do using hotspot on windows
[10:33] <puneet> I looked in some forums but couldn't find a good answer
[10:33] <Tm_T> puneet: you want to share network connection from a phone via wlan?
[10:34] <puneet> no I want to share network connection from my laptop so that I could use net on phone
[10:34] <puneet> Tm_T: ^
[10:34] <Tm_T> ah, that way
[10:35] <puneet> is there any way that I could do reverse tethering on android?
[10:35] <puneet> or any other way, I even tried creating a wireless shared network...but its not working
[10:36] <Tm_T> puneet: how it is not working? (:
[10:36] <puneet> Tm_T: its stuck on configuring interface
[10:36] <puneet> I am not able to connect with it
[10:52] <yongha> Tm_T: if that question comes back around I also am unable to have my system join the wifi provided when my phone is running as a portable hotspot, though it joins other networks without problems. I had to USB tether it once and then it connected fine thereafter
[10:53] <Tm_T> I quickly tested if I could create shared wifi on Kubuntu but it doesn't seem to work except as ad-hoc
[10:53] <yongha> ah so maybe it is an infrasturcture connection issue?
[10:54] <yongha> wait, that isn't right, infrastructure*

[12:10] <Xavi92> Hello everyone. Maverick Meerkat repository servers seem to be offline, so I've switched to old-releases.ubuntu.com
[12:11] <Xavi92> The problem is that now I have around 533 updates to download. Should I download them? I'm afraid of crashing the system if something happens
[12:12] <Xavi92> Distro upgrade isn't an option to consider either

[13:30] <ovidiu-florin> Hello World, I tried to run a program in konsole like this: /usr/bin/konsole --nofork -e test2_AllInOne
[13:31] <ovidiu-florin> and I got this:/usr/bin/konsole: error while loading shared libraries: libattica.so.0.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[13:31] <ovidiu-florin> any ideeas?
[13:34] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: does konsole --nofork work?
[13:34] <sbivol> maybe your program (test2_AllInOne) needs libattica
[13:35] <olafw> ovidiu-florin: is libattica0.4 installed?
[13:35] <ovidiu-florin> sbivol: no it doesn't need that library
[13:35] <ovidiu-florin> maybe konsole needs it to use that function
[13:35] <ovidiu-florin> where can I find that library?
[13:35] <ovidiu-florin> what package>?
[13:35] <olafw> ldd /usr/bin/konsole | grep attica
[13:35] <olafw>         libattica.so.0.4 => /usr/lib/libattica.so.0.4 (0x00007fc296eb3000)
[13:36] <sbivol> konsole doesn't depend on libattica
[13:36] <olafw> the package appears to be libattica0.4
[13:37] <sbivol> olafw: you are right... I wonder what does konsole do with that library...
[13:37] <olafw> it is actualy dependency of kde
[13:37] <olafw> part of QT infrastructure it appears
[13:38] <ovidiu-florin> I'll install it as soont as the update finishes
[13:39] <olafw> you're in the middle of an update?
[13:39] <ovidiu-florin>  I have annother question:  how does ubuntu update an application that is running, without stopping it? what happenes in the background?
[13:40] <olafw> I'd expect the old binary ends up unlinked (but file still open, hence available for paging etc until the app exits) and the new binary installed with the same name, but as a different file.
[13:41] <olafw> Overwriting the binary itself would provoke a crash
[13:41] <olafw> (Or maybe fail with EXTXBSY)
[13:42] <sbivol> olafw: I was also wondering about the update process. what you are saying makes perfect sense to me
[13:46] <ovidiu-florin> I just updated amarok, while it was playing
[13:46] <ovidiu-florin> and I didn't even notice it
[13:46] <ovidiu-florin> if I'll close it the new version will open
[13:46] <ovidiu-florin> but when (if) is the old binary deleted?
[13:47] <ovidiu-florin> I'm rebooting
[13:51] <olafw> the old binary is deleted once the last user of it exits
[13:52] <ovidiu-florin> olafw: so, now that I rebooted, it most definately is deleted?
[13:52] <olafw> yup
[13:53] <ovidiu-florin> yeeey, let's test amarock 2.6 :D
[13:53] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: whe a file is deleted, it's file descriptor remains available for application that had that file open. when you close those applications, the file descriptor vanishes and the file is lost for good

[20:57] <ubottu> epimeth: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience

[21:22] <epimeth> Basically I'm having trouble installing any *buntu on MS Virtual PC and my google-fu, while normally strong, isn't working
[21:23] <epimeth> so if anyone has experience successfully installing kubuntu on MS VPC in Windows 7 then I would appreciate some help :-)
[21:24] <keithzg_> epimeth: I know this doesn't help, if for whatever reason you *have* to use MS VPC, but I've had issues even installing versions of *Windows* in MS VPC; so, at my work, I moved everything over to Virtualbox.
[21:29] <epimeth> I just don't want yet another piece of virtualization tech on my machine.. I need VPC for XP Mode.  I also have been able to install kubuntu in VPC for windows 7 in the past, so I'm a bit confused as to why 12.10 isn't installing....
[21:33] <keithzg_> epimeth: Microsoft themselves doesn't even support VirtualPC anymore; as time goes on, more bugs will accumulate and they'll never be fixed. I'd suggest getting comfortable with VirtualBox (which really is very, very easy) as soon as possible.
[21:34] <keithzg_> epimeth: That being said, I can think of one thing that'd catch ya
[21:34] <keithzg_> epimeth: are you trying to install a 64-bit release of Kubuntu, or 32-bit? Because AFAIK MS-VPC only supports 32-bit.
[21:40] <epimeth> keithzg_: yea, I'll probably end up using a different solution if I can't figure it out.  As for x64 - the ubuntu installer tells you you are trying to install it on a 32bit processor (I found out the hard way) so no, I'm trying to install 32 bit
[21:42] <keithzg_> epimeth: Ah, fair enough. The only remaining thing I can think of would be to ask on #ubuntu-server; nowhere seems too likely , but in the ubuntu channels group that seems the most likely place to find someone who might know a solution or workaround.
