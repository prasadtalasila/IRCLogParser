[11:57] <raven_> hi
[11:58] <raven_> will ubuntu phone be developed for asus padphone 2?
[11:58] <raven_> if not - any way to make a request for it?
[12:13] <doomlord> i'm very pleased it just happens to be on the phone I have
[12:13] <doomlord> my next phone purchase decision will be driven by ubuntu-phone support
[12:23] <xsacha> doomlord: my next purchase will be driven by whether the bootloader is unlocked. sort of the same thing
[12:40] <raven_> any way to make a request for ubuntu on asus padphone 2?
[12:41] <hourd> i think the idea is that it will eventually work on any phone that conforms to the android specification
[12:41] <hourd> s/phone/device/
[12:43] <raven_> hourd, would be nice but a device that not at least supports mass storage access seems to be very closed......
[12:48] <hourd> ? like usb storage?
[12:49] <raven_> yes
[12:49] <raven_> it supports only mtp and ptp
[12:49] <hourd> you can with the otg adapters no?
[12:50] <raven_> whats this?
[12:50] <hourd> microusb -> usb female
[12:51] <hourd> i use it to plug a hdd into my nexus7
[12:51] <hourd> or a keyboard/mouse
[12:51] <raven_> i need mass storage access from my ubuntu notebook
[12:51] <hourd> notebook? then surely it has it?
[12:51] <raven_> ???
[12:51] <raven_> the padphone does not support simply mass storage
[12:51] <hourd> oh....
[12:51] <raven_> only mtp and ptp
[12:52] <hourd> right use the phone as mass storage
[12:52] <hourd> i misundestood
[12:52] <raven_> hourd, it has NO OPTION to provide it as mass storage
[12:53] <hourd> is this ubuntu phone in general or a phone you currently own?
[12:54] <raven_> i want my padphone 2 running android 4.1 be available as mass storage device via my ubuntu notebook
[12:54] <hourd> oh ok. I dont see how that relates to ubuntu phone
[12:54] <raven_> i only wanted to say, because it does not support mass storage access by default it obviously is not wanted to be open by asus
[12:55] <cooperyuan> is ubuntu-phone available for download
[12:55] <hourd> maybe but seems odd as the nexus7 is asus and thats pretty damn open
[12:55] <cooperyuan> I mean source code
[12:55] <hourd> cooperyuan: not yet. check topic
[12:55] <raven_> how to make a ubuntu request for padphone?
[12:56] <cooperyuan> cool, Feb'13
[12:56] <cooperyuan> thanks
[12:56] <hourd> raven_: i don't think you can
[12:56] <raven_> why?
[12:56] <hourd> raven_: and why would it be an ubuntu request?
[12:56] <hourd> to do what?
[12:56] <popey> raven_: we're not taking requests at the moment
[12:56] <doomlord> he want ubuntu ported to padphone
[12:57] <doomlord> offer bounty
[12:57] <doomlord> thats one of the compromises with FOSS..  so much hardware variety, you can't expect it will all be supported
[12:58] <popey> well, we're expecting the community to help in that regard
[12:59] <hourd> isn't that why its conforming the the android hardware spec so that its easier to support the individual devices
[13:00] <doomlord> i gaather android is very fragmented though .. its like PC's all over again, many permutations
[13:00] <doomlord> difficult to test :)
[13:04] <doomlord> i'd be curious to know if ubuntu (phone/android) can acess the pressure sensitive pen on the Galaxy Note devices
[13:04] <doomlord> i'd like to get one of those.. but would hesitate if ubuntu can't exploit it
[13:05] <doomlord> it would make a lot more sense of the ability to run a desktop on it i think (more so the 10' tablet)

[13:59] <elpapo> Hi, Do you think the SAR (radiation Value) will be changed if installing Ubuntu on Samsung Galaxy Nexus? (http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone)
[13:59] <elpapo> Just a thought...
[14:17] <krovatti> elpapo: independently i think
[14:38] <elpapo> krovatti, Ok, thx for answer.
[15:20] <Jester86> Hey all, I have an old smart phone.. original droid.
[15:21] <Jester86> I've been considering upgrading but will lose my unlimited data and what not.
[15:21] <smartboyhw> Jester86, wow
[15:22] <Jester86> That in mind, I'd be willing to consider leaving verizon for a cheaper plan if possible.  Do any of you think any vendor will be more likely to adopt Ubuntu Phone.
[15:22] <hourd> Jester86: just buy one outright and keep your dataplan
[15:22] <hourd> thats what i did
[15:22] <Jester86> yes.. smartboyhw.. i've been running aftermarket roms on it for a while so it hasn't been bad but with the more recent CG milestone rom its just been dog slow.
[15:23] <Jester86> hourd.. I would be the issue is that I'm still on the family plan from when i was in college/high school.  I'm afraid eventually one of my family members will do an upgrade and screw the pooch.
[15:24] <Jester86> we all pitch in on the bill but I'm sure its only a matter of time until one of them jacks it up.
[15:25] <Jester86> I use my phone to stream music all day ever day.. and use it for navigation for 30+ minutes at least once a week on average.
[15:25] <Jester86> I'm not sure what sort of data that comes out to per month but I'm sure I'm over 2 gigs
[15:25] <Jester86> probably over 4
[15:26] <Jester86> with verizon's new plans there is a $60 fee just for having the basic service in addition to your data plan.. my bill would easily go up quite a bit from where I am today.

[15:54] <krovatti> popey, so what's about my question about integrating brand new apps or games into Ubuntu Phone. can everyone offer it and will it be available "out of the box". I know there's no official answer this time.  just your thoughts as a developer at Canonical
[15:54] <krovatti> Loofy, hi ) what's up?
[15:57] <popey> hello krovatti
[15:57] <popey> krovatti: not sure I understand your question
[15:58] <krovatti> popey: ok, i'll rewrite it
[15:59] <krovatti> popey: i mean next situation. imagine. i'm a developer and i wrote a cool app (or game). can i offer it to the community and then will this app (or game) distribute with Ubuntu Phone?
[16:00] <krovatti> popey: is this clear?
[16:01] <popey> you mean, shipping out of the box?
[16:02] <krovatti> popey: yes
[16:02] <popey> krovatti: we're already looking at a set of core apps. maybe you saw jono's blog post about it?
[16:02] <popey> http://www.jonobacon.org/2013/01/23/community-driven-ubuntu-phone-core-apps/
[16:04] <krovatti> popey: i know about searching for a CORE APPS (such as timer, alarm clock). i mean non core apps (such as translator for e.g. or brick breaker game). and yes, i'll contribute some code and ideas to core apps
[16:04] <blackout23> I'd belive that any 3rd party app will simply be available for download through the ported Software Center on the phone
[16:05] <blackout23> imagine there are 5000 apps at some point they won't come preinstalled when they leave the factory of course
[16:06] <blackout23> Every smartphone only ships with the core applications.
[16:06] <krovatti> blackout23: yes, they will be. but i told about apps distributing in system by default ("out of the box", but not core apps) :)
[16:07] <krovatti> blackout23: let me don't agree with you. in some regions, some oem's distribute own apps or games with core apps
[16:07] <blackout23> I don't understand what you mean to be honest
[16:08] <blackout23> yes that's up the the oem
[16:08] <blackout23> Canonical has its core apps. OEM adds maybe 4 of their own that's it.
[16:08] <blackout23> Some might ship vanila Ubuntu Phone kind of like the Nexus with vanilla Android
[16:09] <blackout23> anything else is just a community contribution and will not be preinstalled
[16:09] <krovatti> blackout23: f***. go back to the previous messages and try to figure out :)
[16:09] <krovatti> blackout23: oh, thanks
[16:10] <krovatti> blackout23: are you a dev at Canonical?
[16:10] <blackout23> nope but I'd be very surprised if it won't be like I just explained. Anything else just doesn't make any sense.
[16:12] <krovatti> blackout23: maybe you're right
[16:14] <blackout23> This how everyone in the industry handles it. Some carriers in the US deliver customized phones to their customers to include their own set of Apps. Some OEM like HTC and Samsung have their own Android spinoff. If you want Android without anything you need to buy a Nexus device.
[16:16] <blackout23> In Europe network carrier apps are not that common. Phone are generaly unlocked and unbranded. Only if you let's say a Galaxy S3 you'll find some Samsung Apps that are not part of the original Android that comes from Google.
[16:17] <blackout23> + buy
[16:25] <doomlord> is it likely aanyone will SHIP ubuntu phones?
[16:26] <blackout23> That's canonicals goal to have handset manufacturs making Ubuntu Phones that you can buy in stores or with your new phone contract.
[16:27] <popey> doomlord: yes
[16:28] <blackout23> popey: but there is no offical OEM that will make Ubuntu Phones I guess at this point?
[16:28] <doomlord> well i do home this crystalizes. it wouuld be awesome
[16:28] <xsacha> is dell interested?
[16:28] <popey> we have nothing to announce yet.
[16:30] <blackout23> I think it is intersting to see that even Samsung doesn't want to be married to Android even though their Galaxy Smartphones with Android are very successful
[16:31] <blackout23> otherwise they wouldn't be Tizen
[16:36] <doomlord> tizen=?

[17:44] <blackout23> brb
[17:52] <moocow1452> Wondering the possiblity at this point of having something like Tasker available for Ubuntu Phone. Would a straight port be possible if the developer is willing to put in the time, and/or could a port be feasibly made?
[17:54] <moocow1452> blackout, you got my last message about the possiblity of something like Tasker or Tasker itself on the Ubuntu Phone?
[17:55] <moocow1452> Do we know anything about how apps would be run or ported at this point, or is it mostly guess work?
[18:02] <blackout23> I'm not familiar with the program called Tasker
[18:02] <Wiz007> can I install ubuntu in Xperia u?
[18:02] <blackout23> The developer would have to do a port with C/C++ and QML  as far as I know
[18:03] <blackout23> Wiz007 if someone builds an image for your phone than yes
[18:03] <blackout23> the first image that will be availabe will be for Samsung Galaxy Nexus
[18:04] <blackout23> The community would have to do a port for your phone just like there are ports of Android ROMs for different devices
[18:05] <Wiz007> I dont think ubuntu will work fine in xperia as it has only 512mb ram
[18:05] <Wiz007> even if the image is released
[18:07] <blackout23> 512 MB seems to be the minimum requirement for low end phones with Ubuntu OS.

[18:14] <surgemcgee> Is there a way to change the Button sizes in the Ubuntu components?
[18:22] <doomlord> can you display the regular desktop on ubuntu phone on the phone (however unusuable it might be)
[18:22] <doomlord> kind of like win8's "desktop-is-an-app" perhaps
[18:37] <blackout23> I don't think there is such a feature right now. And it would be rather hard. The 1280x720 resolution of the Galaxy Nexus might be comparable to a desktop resolution
[18:37] <blackout23> but on a 4.7 inch display window controls would be tiny
[18:38] <blackout23> I could only think of an option where you zoom and pan the Desktop like you do with a Website on a mobile browser
[18:39] <blackout23> But I'm rather sure that this isn't a top priority of canonical at this time to include such a feature
[18:41] <blackout23> It would be kind of cool I have to agree but more from a geeky point of view
[18:41] <doomlord> i presume the phone will get a terminal app :)
[18:42] <Joe_B> Terminal is one of the core apps, see here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuPhone/CoreApps/Design
[18:43] <xsacha> i sure hope it is as good as the nokia n9 terminal :D
[18:44] <blackout23> I did some of the mockup work you can see on the balsamiq site
[18:44] <blackout23> I don't know about the n9 terminal but I think my idea might be the best possible touch terminal
[18:45] <blackout23> You don't need extra keys. You hardly have to type anything, because the way autocompletion is done.  etc.
[18:47] <xsacha> yeah the n9 one is seriously the best one i've ever used. it felt really nice
[18:47] <xsacha> and n9 has no buttons
[18:47] <xsacha> irssi was really nice in it
[18:49] <blackout23> I'll see if I can find a video.
[18:49] <blackout23> but n9 has a slide out physical keyboard if i remember correct?
[18:50] <popey> no
[18:50] <popey> n950 does
[18:52] <Joe_B> blackout23, I just left a comment there actually.
[18:52] <Joe_B> I was wondering how you would scroll up if scroll was dedicated to cycling through previous commands.
[18:53] <Joe_B> I thought maybe use the volume rocker to scroll through commands and swipe up/down to scroll through previous output?
[18:53] <xsacha> http://vesuri.jormas.com/n9apps/n9-irssi.png
[18:57] <blackout23> Joe_B I replied
[18:59] <blackout23> xsacha so for ctrl + shift + v for pasting text from clipboard into terminal you have to get 3 fingers on the touchkeyboard?
[19:07] <Joe_B> Ideally we can cover completion, cycling through previous commands, jump to end of line & beginning of line and scrolling.  I'd also add jump by word (though tapping on the location you want the cursor seems ok).  Anything else?
[20:24] <ninjaaron> Are the default coreutils on the phone going to be GNU, busybox, or something else?

=== SkavenXXI is now known as SkavenXXI-[OFF]
[20:29] <dmj_nova> I would hope they're identical to the desktop ones
[20:31] <ninjaaron> dmj_nova: That would be ideal, but something like busybox might provide better performance, being designed for embedded devices.
[20:32] <ninjaaron> The wiki page about the terminal app says something about 'integration with busybox commands,' which lead me to believe that busybox might be used on the phone instead of GNU.
[20:46] <ninjaaron> Interesting. sh on ubuntu is dash (I would have expected bash), so I guess the busybox shell (ash) should already run... though looking now, some of them have bash in the shebang, but the syntax is POSIX, as far as I can tell. Eh... whatever. I'm sure someone has already thought of all this.

[22:28] <MrMorf>  people i have a one question about ubuntu phone.
[22:28] <MrMorf>  Can i buy phone on android, and in the future change andriod os for ubuntu?
[22:29] <oh7fdn> yep
[22:30] <k1l> gdane: you saw the hardware specs mentioned on the http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone/operators-and-oems site ?
[22:30] <MrMorf> oh7fdn, thx
[22:30] <k1l> MrMorf: see the hardware recommendations and make sure  your device got a open bootloader
[22:30] <gdane> k1l, thx, i didnt see this page before
[22:31] <oh7fdn> galaxy nexus should work fine...
[22:32] <gdane> hmm cortex a9 - is it a armv5 or armv7?
[22:32] <Hashcode> v7
[22:32] <gdane> ohh then pxa more older proc
[22:32] <k1l> gdane: what i saw that device you mentioned looks too old/slow
[22:33] <gdane> i have htc x7510
[22:33] <gdane> athena
[22:33] <gdane> so ill wait my rasperri py then
[22:33] <gdane> it have to be delivered soon
[22:34] <gdane> right now i have debian rootfs + xfce on htc x7510
[22:34] <gdane> but comunicator stacks then i try to mek apt-get update
[22:34] <gdane> *make
[22:35] <k1l> gdane: that raspberry pi is not a ubuntu-phone hardware. you better want to look into #ubuntu-arm for that (but there is no ubuntu port for raspberry pi )
[22:35] <gdane> shell without x11 works fine
[22:37] <Hashcode> Does the GNex demo run on the current Android 3.0 kernel?  Or does Ubuntu Phone need alterations?
[22:38] <MrMorf> k1l: unfortunately, i had a lot of money and whant buy phone like as Prestigio PAP4040 DUO,  ZTE V880E.  How u think can i install ubuntu on this phone. I'm not very good at flashing phones, this would love to hear your opinion. Is it worth? 'm Afraid not wait to release their ancient phone handsets with preinstalled OS.
[22:40] <doomlord> whats the expected support roadmap for ubuntu phone. (i.e which phones is it likely to run on)
[22:40] <k1l> MrMorf: if you want to be safe get a galaxy nexus. since that is the dev-phone it will support ubuntu-phone. what devices will recieve support is not mentioned, yet
[22:41] <Hashcode> I would imagine some of that will depend on manufacturers and community devs putting it on existing devices.
[22:41] <k1l> doomlord: see that hardware minimum specs as posted above. and like i just told its not mentioned so far which devices will recieve support
[22:42] <Hashcode> I have so many technical questions about the GNex implementation (I support 5 OMAP4 phones for Android).  Feb 13th is far far away. :/
[22:43] <k1l> Hashcode: just ask them here an be patient. its not a very living channel but most phone-team guys idle in here and take a peek from time to time.
[22:44] <Hashcode> AH, wasn't sure any of the phone-team actually stopped by
[22:46] <gdane> Does Canonical plan to work with older comunicators?
[22:46] <k1l> gdane: honestly
[22:46] <k1l> , i would stick to the recommendations mentioned on that page, so far
[22:47] <gdane> ok, ill do when ill plane to buy new comunicator
[22:47] <gdane> bur right now i dont need new one
[22:47] <gdane> i work with stuff i have already
[22:48] <Hashcode> Dev Question: OMAP Android uses OMX-IL layer for HD codec/camera support.  Standard Ubuntu for devices like PandaBoard don't use OMX layer.  They use Gstreamer, etc.  Which will Ubuntu Phone use?
[22:48] <MrMorf> k1l, tnx for answer. I see on website, that different untill "Entry level Ubuntu smartphone" and "High-end Ubuntu "superphone"" only in desktop convergence? If i had PC with Windows, i think that i don't need high-end b coz, on my pc don't install unbuntu (only in virtual box). How u think, on this basis, what better buy: phone with  Cortex A9  or  Quad-core A9 or Intel Atom?
[22:50] <MrMorf> that is, I mean, I would buy high-end? in addition to performance.
[22:50] <k1l> MrMorf: i understand it that way, that you need the more power for a fluid desktop experience when docking the phone in and use it as a desktop with mouse and keyboard and monitor.
[22:52] <k1l> MrMorf: at this stage there is not much information on how good the real OS is running on which hardware. the whole OS is not really done right now. so i would wait for the code and images to show at the end of february
[22:53] <k1l> phones with ubuntu-phone are expected not before end of 2013 more like 2014.
[22:58] <MrMorf> k1l: I'm beginning to understand you better. But not sure that we understand each other correctly.I want to buy a new phone, but in the future to install ubuntu on it. But if I installed Windows. That is, whether it makes sense to take the more expensive phone with an "Quad-core A9 or Intel Atom" when in fact, I will not use the Desktop convergence?
[22:59] <MrMorf> windows on my PC*
[23:00] <k1l> MrMorf: you are not forced to use the desktop mode on that phone :) but since its hardware and this is still an early developing stage i would stick to the developing phone (galaxy nexus) or go with a similar better equipped one. i think a 4core device will run more fluid. but noone can guarantee you anything right now
[23:03] <MrMorf> k1l: tnx for u time and answer  :)
[23:23] <livefree424> Anyone have an ETA on when you can buy a phone with it pre-installed, ill probly flash it myself after its further developed but I would love to see it for sale in stores
