[15:29] <dpm> hi chrisccoulson, quick question: I tried to delete an address book in TB, and other than a warning that it was an EDS folder and that it could not be deleted, nothing happened. Now I restarted TB to find that all my address books have gone and I cannot even create new ones. Any ideas on how I could get back my address books, or at least create new ones?
[15:31] <dpm> ah, they're back!
[15:31] <dpm> weird. Anyway, just ignore the message above :)
