[03:46] <cyberanger> wrst: guessing common cold mixed with allergies
[03:47] <cyberanger> aside from the allergies & issues speaking, a rare (3-5 hour apart for the bad ones, one hour for mild) cough
[03:47] <cyberanger> no symptoms to make sense out of
[03:56] <wrst> cold is at least manageable misery
[03:57] <wrst> looks good chris4585
[03:57] <cyberanger> aside from talking, isn't really any misery
[03:57] <chris4585> wrst, thanks, I spent about 2hrs on it
[03:57] <chris4585> just slowly doing things right the first time
[03:57] <cyberanger> chris4585: still pulling it up (running firefox with trickle, simulating a satphone)
[03:58] <wrst> just type don't talk cyberanger
[03:58] <chris4585> cyberanger, hows that working?
[03:59] <cyberanger> chris4585: working like a slow charm (doing it's job perfectly though, shows me what I needed to know, what sites will work ok, what sites are just too big, and what ones fight with squid cacheing proxy)
[04:01] <chris4585> ah sounds good
[04:05] <cyberanger> my filter tried blocking it for the word porn (tags: ...computerporn)
[04:06] <cyberanger> easy to fix (I did say I use squidguard with squid, yes? well no I have)

[04:08] <chris4585> cyberanger, thanks, I tried to make it look good
