[20:03] <AlanBell> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MeetingLogs/IRCC/20121125
[20:03] <AlanBell> christmas happened
[20:03] <Pici> oh hey, I was there.
[20:03] <AlanBell> and this is a slightly drifted january meeting
[20:03] <Pici> Its still January here.
[20:03] <AlanBell> it is :)
[20:04] <AlanBell> so we sorted out the issue that was in the tracker
[20:04] <Pici> so... lets see, what did we do last time
[20:04] <AlanBell> we pruned the akick lists
[20:04] <AlanBell> m4v membership was postponed, but we can sort that out in a bit when topyli and tm_t have sorted their stuff out
[20:05] <Pici> hmm hmm
[20:05] <AlanBell> and me to sort out list of operator applicants for next meeting. . .
[20:05] <Pici> Do we have mor?
[20:05] <Pici> e
[20:05] <AlanBell> why was I going to do that I wonder
[20:05] <Pici> It wasn't my turn to read your thoughts, sorry.
[20:06] <AlanBell> I think we did all that
[20:06] <Pici> I think we might have a pending item in the tracker...
[20:06] <AlanBell> yes, just seen that
[20:07] <AlanBell> ok, that last action item was sorted out, it was the last round of operators where we rejected all bar k1l
[20:07] <AlanBell> there are no applicants in the queues right now
[20:08] <Pici> Good, good.
[20:08] <Pici> Er, I think.
[20:08] <Pici> I mean, its good that nothing is pending.
[20:09] <AlanBell> good that we did all the actions on the last minutes :)

[20:11] <Pici> Yeah, thats what it looks like.
[20:13] <AlanBell> yes, just a kick

[20:15] <AlanBell> does anyone have any thoughts or issues they want to raise?
[20:15] <Pici> Is anyone else here?
[20:15] <Unit193> Nope.
[20:16]  * Pici rolls around like a tumbleweed.
[20:16]  * tumbleweed waves to Pici
[20:16] <Pici> oops
[20:16] <tumbleweed> :)
[20:18] <AlanBell> :)
[20:18]  * tumbleweed has that effect on the channels I hang out in
[20:21] <Pici> sooo
[20:21] <Myrtti> yes.
[20:21] <Unit193> Bummer, I had hoped someone would get membership. :/
[20:22]  * AlanBell wonders if m4v is around
[20:27] <Pici> AlanBell: do we even have quorum if he did show up?
[20:27] <AlanBell> if topyli and tm_t turn up
[20:27] <AlanBell> they said they would be later rather than earlier
[20:29] <Pici> okay.
[20:29] <Pici> I'm fine with just hanging out until then
[20:29] <Unit193> AlanBell: Anything new in the IRC bugs?  Bots bugs?
[20:30] <AlanBell> none assigned to the council as such
