[15:09] <stokachu> Hi, may i get an ubuntu cloak? https://launchpad.net/~adam-stokes
[15:09] <stgraber> hey there
[15:10] <stgraber> it's been on my todo for a while but I finally found a spare cycle for it :)
[15:10] <Myrtti> stgraber: what is?
[15:10] <stgraber> I've been running queuebot in #ubuntu-release, #ubuntu-testing and a few other IRC channels for the past year or so
[15:10] <Myrtti> ah
[15:10] <stgraber> I now finally registered an account for it. Can I get a bot cloak for it?
[15:11] <stgraber> account is "queuebot", so ubuntu/bot/queuebot would make the most sense I guess
[15:11] <k1l> stokachu: looks good for me. just wait for some IIRC member to accept
[15:11] <stokachu> k1l: thank you
[15:14] <Pici> stokachu: oh, here you are.  This normally would replace your canonical cloak, is that what you want?
[15:14] <stokachu> Pici: yes please
[15:15] <stokachu> Pici: sorry i saw this channel after i pinged you
[15:15] <Pici> stokachu: I just tabbed over to IRC, so no worries.
[15:16]  * Myrtti waits with baited breath
[15:16] <f> oh, a Myrtti
[15:16]  * f cuddles and puts his cloaking device aside
[15:16] <Pici> f: perfect timing.
[15:16] <f> Pici: see #freenode, I don't want to steal Myrttis job :p
[15:16] <Pici> f: Could you please setup stokachu with an ubuntu/member/stokachu cloak?
[15:17] <Myrtti> you're welcome
[15:17] <Pici> Myrtti: somehow I forgot you were staff. sorry :/
[15:17] <Myrtti> np
[15:17] <f> Pici: there is also a bot cloak request, don't know how you handle these, stgraber
[15:17] <stokachu> awesome thanks everyone
[15:19] <Pici> stgraber: let me jump through some documentation hoops first and then we can get that setup.
[15:19] <Pici> I've seen it around for a while so I think its a no-brainer for an ubuntu bot cloak.
[15:21] <stgraber> Pici: No rush, I just figured it'd be good for a bot run by the release team to actually follow the policy and get a bot cloak ;)
[15:28] <Pici> Myrtti: If you're still around, could you please cloak queuebot with ubuntu/bot/queuebot please?
[15:29] <f> if she's not then I will
[15:29] <Myrtti> done
[15:29] <Pici> Myrtti: thanks :)
[15:29] <Pici> stgraber: all set :)
[15:30] <stgraber> Pici: thanks
[15:30] <stgraber> Myrtti: and to you too
[15:31] <Myrtti> your welcome
[15:31]  * f gives Myrtti a cookie <3
