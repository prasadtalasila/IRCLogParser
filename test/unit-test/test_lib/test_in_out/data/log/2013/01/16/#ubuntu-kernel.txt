[02:55] <hallyn> apw: say, i'm hoping to do a lxc irc meeting in a few weeks to discuss direction with userns.  The first 20 minutes would be an overview.  Would you or anyone from kernel team want to listen in on that part?

[14:40] <arges> found an interesting kernel bug. plugging and unplugging a usb headset causes a panic on 3.2
[14:44] <jsalisbury> arges, can you reproduce it easily?
[14:45] <arges> jsalisbury: yea i'm doing that now... getting a backtrace and if we are really lucky ill have a vmcore as well
[14:46] <jsalisbury> arges, cool.  I recall a similar bug reported in the past few days.  I don't remember off had if it was for Precise.  I'll go an look
[14:48] <jsalisbury> arges, it could be bug 1097396 that you are hitting.  
[14:48] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1097396 in linux (Ubuntu) "Unplugging USB Headset causes Kernel Panic" [High,Incomplete] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1097396
[14:48] <arges> jsalisbury: easily reproducible at this point.. tempted to try my raring laptop. but don't want to loose IRC
[14:49] <arges> jsalisbury: cool looks like this is also precise
[14:49] <jsalisbury> arges, yeah, I started a bisect, but waiting for testing feedback.  
[14:49] <jsalisbury> arges, can you try the latest 3.2 kernel?  It's 3.2.37 now
[14:49] <arges> jsalisbury: let me compare notes
[14:50] <arges> jsalisbury: to see if i'm hitting the same thing
[14:50] <jsalisbury> arges, that bug is fixed in mainline
[14:50] <jsalisbury> arges, and raring
[14:52] <arges> jsalisbury: we have a winner snd_complete_urb
[14:52] <arges> jsalisbury: same backtrace here
[14:52] <jsalisbury> arges, cool
[14:52] <arges> downloading and testing 
[14:53] <jsalisbury> arges, yeah, it could be fixed in .37 since it's fixed in the 3.7 and 3.8 kernels.
[15:00] <arges> jsalisbury: ok tried that kernel still paniced
[15:01] <jsalisbury> arges, ok.  Maybe a reverse bisect is needed
[15:01] <arges> hmm now kdump wants to work :)
[15:02] <jsalisbury> heh
[15:02] <sforshee> cking, does the firmware on your x230 have an object named BRTW in the EC namespace that is returned by _BCL?
[15:03] <jsalisbury> arges, i haven't done any research upstream on that bug yet.  That's another approach in addition to a reverse bisect
[15:04] <arges> jsalisbury: if you want to start the bisect, i could look at the backtrace a bit and see if  I can get anything by looking and blaming
[15:04] <jsalisbury> arges, I believe v3.7 final did not have the bug.  Maybe try v3.6 final?
[15:04] <arges> jsalisbury: ok that's a bit easier... machine is still taking a dump
[15:04] <arges> that sounds bad
[15:05] <jsalisbury> arges, sure.  I can't reproduce the bug here, but I'll update bug 1097396 and work with Tony

[15:07] <arges> jsalisbury:well i'lll test 3.6 first 
[15:07] <jsalisbury> arges, cool
[15:07] <arges> jsalisbury: and i can do the bisect
[15:07] <jsalisbury> arges, great.  can you also update that bug as you go?
[15:08] <arges> jsalisbury: yup
[15:08] <jsalisbury> arges, thanks!

[18:43] <hallyn> say, I'm getting a build error in libvirt due to include/linux/if_bridge.h using struct in6_addr without it being defined.  
[18:43] <hallyn> can that be considered a bug in the header?
[18:43] <hallyn> or is it reasonable to say all userspace using that now has to #include <netinet/in.h> ?
[18:43] <doc___> Kernel question: I'm trying to write an app that talks to USB cameras. Should I use /dev, /proc or sysfs?
[18:45] <hallyn> it was added on dec 6 as part of commit "bridge: export multicast database via netlink"
[19:55] <apw> hallyn, well if in4_addr is defined without additional headers and in6_addr not, that sounds like a bug
[19:56]  * rtg -> EOD
[19:56] <hallyn> apw: i suspect in4_addr is also not defined
[19:56] <hallyn> apw: but that isn't used in if_bridge itself
[19:56] <apw> oh hmmm, i wonder why in6_addr is used
[19:57] <hallyn> apw: see https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2013-January/msg00957.html.  it was used as of a commit on dec 7
[19:58] <hallyn> oh, i see.  i thought the thread on netdev had died, but i guess it's more recent than i thought, so still on-going
[20:01] <apw> hallyn, well that doesn't really resolve ... but hopfully will
[20:03] <hallyn> apw: right.  hopefully.  meanwhile i'll work around it in libvirt (using the upstream patch) but i expect more build breakages in raring
