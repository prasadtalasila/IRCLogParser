[12:54] <mlankhorst> wondering about starting the x1.14 rebuild
[12:55] <ricotz> i guess in a ppa?
[12:56] <mlankhorst> I was hoping for some more commits to the xserver first, I thought there was still an input abi queued as well
[12:56] <ricotz> right
[12:57] <ricotz> it would interesting to have it in edgers though
[12:59] <mlankhorst> I did the port of xorg-server already in the git tree
[13:00] <ricotz> building xorg-server is least of the work ;)
[13:01] <mlankhorst> it's the only part requiring thinking, though..
[13:01] <ricotz> if all driver (upstream) repos caught up, yeah, then it is
[13:02] <mlankhorst> yeah we are mostly following those repos already
[14:09]  * mlankhorst tries piglit
[14:54] <bjsnider> tjaalton, ah, good. i'll check it out myself in a few weeks.
