[00:41] <slangasek> blkperl: yes, something may have been mentioned to me about the plymouth thread.  I've been travelling this week though, so haven't been in a position to comment
[01:14] <bkerensa> slangasek: how was china?
[01:35] <c_smith> hmmmmm...... seems porting Ubuntu For Phones to a Tegra-2 device like my Acer Iconia Tab A100 is not as impossible as I though, biggest issues would be the Tegra 2 (of course) and drivers)
[01:35] <c_smith> that is, if the codebase allows the port.
[01:35] <c_smith> wish I had the know-how to do so, I'll have to rely on the devs at XDA
[01:39] <bkerensa> c_smith: Its going to be a lot more then that... You will need drivers which are not open source
[01:39] <c_smith> true.
[01:40] <c_smith> I'm also talking on iconia-dev, they said it's a possibility but the drivers and tegra-2 part would be an issue.
[01:40] <c_smith> *#iconia-dev
[01:41] <c_smith> wonder if it'd be possible to put this on a Nexus 4......
[01:41] <c_smith> it's not being aimed at that, but I have to ask.
[01:41] <c_smith> or is the device it's being developed for still for sale?
[01:46] <bkerensa> They dont have a device its being developed for yet
[01:46] <bkerensa> The image that comes out will be for Gnex so developers can start making apps and test out the platform
[01:48] <c_smith> I'm talking the Gnex,
[01:48] <c_smith> still, it'd be more of something for me to toy with, lol
[01:49] <bkerensa> Good luck :) I don't think they are releasing source
[01:49] <bkerensa> its going to be built already
[01:49] <bkerensa> so not much to toy with
[01:49] <bkerensa> without source
[01:50] <c_smith> yeah
[01:50] <c_smith> either way, it's not the most likely case I'll get it. :P
[01:50] <c_smith> especially with how little I have in the bank and what I have to save for in fall.
[01:51] <c_smith> Wonder if anything Ubuntu exists for the Nexus 4......
[01:52] <c_smith> Google tells me no, lol
[03:02] <slangasek> bkerensa: it was very Chinese!
[05:09] <c_smith> slangasek, lol
[07:29] <bkerensa> slangasek: lots of meat, rice and veggies I imagine then :)
=== mbarnett` is now known as mbarnett
[19:41] <slangasek> bkerensa: not a whole lot of rice; and it was easy to skip.  The dim sum was more prevalent than rice itself.
