[18:01] <JanC> GuidoPallemans: you can use every icon you want, so "all" would be a very long list?  â˜º
[18:11] <GuidoPallemans> I need to pick a few on sight

[21:51] <aquarius> getting a weird QML bug. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1556688/ shows a row of red squares; if I resize the window, the squares disappear! Baffled; this seems like a bug. Any ideas?
[21:54] <stqn> bye (no idea)
[22:02] <GuidoPallemans> aquarius: try in #qt-qml
[22:02] <aquarius> GuidoPallemans, yeah, I'm trying there too :)
[22:03] <aquarius> GuidoPallemans, incidentally, all your icon themes are in /usr/share/icons, so you can look in, for example, /usr/share/icons/Humanity to see a bunch of icons.
[22:04] <GuidoPallemans> oh, thanks
[22:37] <hdhzero> how can one develop an interface similar to ubuntu software center using gtk or qt?
[22:37] <hdhzero> is using glade?
[23:08] <airglide> hello everyone, i need some help, I've made an application and I want to link the files with a specific extension to the program and give it an icon, I've tried creating a mime type and then copying a .svg in to /usr/share/icons/gnome/scalable, but it doesn't work
[23:10] <airglide> if I go to the file and properties there's written: text/x-mup as type
[23:11] <qwertzui11> why svg, not png in different sizes?
[23:11] <airglide> it was described like that in a tutorial and i thought it might be easier to begin
[23:12] <airglide> but adding .png would be better
[23:12] <qwertzui11> okay
[23:12] <airglide> I just found this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AddingMimeTypes
[23:12] <airglide> is there a tutorial for doing this?
[23:13] <qwertzui11> sec
[23:14] <qwertzui11> hmmm did u name the file corrctly?
[23:15] <airglide> i've added: application/sourcenote                          not
[23:15] <qwertzui11> hmm... except the, I've got no idea, sry - I'm sure someone else can help u :)
[23:16] <qwertzui11> *the = that
[23:16] <airglide> thank u anyway ;)
[23:16] <qwertzui11> haha, ur welcome
