[00:06] <saltmiser> nice
[00:06] <saltmiser> virtualbox vs. vmware?
[00:06] <saltmiser> I noticted virtualbox doesn't really do multiple CPU's
[00:06] <k1l_> vbox is easy to use
[00:06] <saltmiser> but when I run vmware player with multiple cpu's I get excellent performance
[00:06] <saltmiser> vbox has terrible smp performance, and it has for over a year..or two...now, why?
[00:06] <k1l_> if you know what you are doing you want to go with vmware, imho
[00:07] <saltmiser> alright
[00:07] <saltmiser> I've been using virtualbox for a while and was always a little upset with it's lack of good multi cpu support
[00:07] <saltmiser> I have a 6 core and well you know, it's bored
[00:07] <saltmiser> I started using vmware recently and am much more happier
[00:07] <saltmiser> I might actually start using windows as my real host OS again so I  can get some games in from tiem to time ;D
[00:07] <rypervenche> KVM^^
[00:07] <saltmiser> KVM?
[00:08] <namesJay> Vmware ?
[00:08] <saltmiser> rypervenche, you mean like qemu?
[00:08] <rypervenche> Yep.
[00:09] <saltmiser> people still use that?
[00:09] <rypervenche> Of course.
[00:09] <saltmiser> what is the advantage of using KVM/qemu these days when we have hardware supported virtualization?
[00:20] <saltmiser> what other good discussion channels are there
[00:24] <Amphibulus> saltmiser, KVM use the hardware virtualization
=== k1l_ is now known as k1l
