[00:09] <mhall119> AlanBell: have you made your fortune by spying on Gnome Shell users yet?
[00:13]  * AlanBell checks the piggie bank
[00:23] <AlanBell> I don't appear to have made any money or had any clicks through for several days
[00:24] <daker> hhh
[00:24] <AlanBell> I can see searches are happening
[00:24] <AlanBell> but people are not clicking the results
[00:24] <mhall119> AlanBell: you're not spying enough, have you considered using drones?
[00:25]  * AlanBell would love a drone
[00:41] <mhall119> bkerensa: I'll warn you, I'm in a mood to fight tonight
[01:52] <bkerensa> mhall119: in that case perhaps a discussion on gun control or platinum coins in a half hour? ;)
[02:41] <mhall119> we'd agree too much on one, and the other just isn't going to happen
[02:42]  * mhall119 leaves it as an exercise to the reader to determine which is which
[08:36] <Tm_T> mhall119: awww
[08:56] <czajkowski> bkerensa: wow flame bate post or what!
[08:57] <bkerensa> czajkowski: its pretty valid
[08:57] <czajkowski> A patch doesn't have to be accepted at all
[08:58] <czajkowski> just seemms like a post to get people to your site for traffic tbh
[09:02] <bkerensa> No its more about defending user choice
[09:02] <bkerensa> A patch does not have to be accepted
[09:03] <philipballew> these logs provide for some good late night reading!
[09:03]  * philipballew sits down and grabs a cup of coffee
[09:04] <bkerensa> philipballew:  ;)
[09:04] <czajkowski> meh I have work to do
[09:04] <philipballew> im always down to discuss anything with  bkerensa.
[09:04] <philipballew> czajkowski, its already my weekend
[09:04] <czajkowski> not getting drawn into such a debate - it is what it is.
[09:05] <philipballew> I thought I had a Wednesday/Friday class, but turns out it starts in march. Only found out after I sat in the classroom for 30 minutes Wednesday wondering why nobody was there...
[16:28] <jcastro> ah nuts, those links were in my hangout chat
[16:29] <jcastro> can you paste the theme links in here? sorry. :-/
[16:32] <dpm> mhall119, I think that one's for you ^
[16:38] <balloons> yay, hangout stayed up for the whole convo ;-)
[16:41] <mhall119> jcastro: http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~quickly/quickly/reboot/files/head:/docs/source/themes/ubuntu/
[16:41] <mhall119> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~quickly/quickly/reboot/view/head:/docs/source/conf.py#L94
[16:42] <mhall119> it would be nice to get a hangout transcript after they end
