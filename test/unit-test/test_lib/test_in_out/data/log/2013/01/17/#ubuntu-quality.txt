[06:16] <pitti> Good morning
[07:18] <zyga> pitti: hey, how are you :-)
[07:19] <pitti> hey zyga; quite fine, thanks! how about yourself?
[07:19] <zyga> pitti: waking up in the morning always feels good :)
[07:20] <zyga> pitti: we're all doing fine :)
[07:21] <pitti> yeah, one gets a lot done before the crowd arrives and starts IRC pings :)
[07:22] <zyga> pitti: irc is fine in comparison, this is the hangout day, mid iteration analysis and so on, it's impossible to work on something during that kind of meeting

[17:53] <cking> plars, ping
[17:54] <plars> cking: I'm about to move rooms, but pong
[17:55] <cking> plars, I've looked at the power measurement tests, and I was wondering if it's possible for you to get me all the sample.log files that these tests generate so I can analyse the raw data
[17:57] <plars> cking: I saw the email, just haven't had a chance to respond yet. Yes, we can update the job to have it grab the sample.log, do you happen to remember where it drops it? Unfortunately the system used is reinstalled each time, so I don't have and easy way to get it right now
[17:58] <plars> but that way will have it next time it rns
[17:58] <plars> *runs
[17:59] <cking> hrm, I can't say at the mo, I'm about to head out of the office in London. I will figure it out and get back to you
[18:00] <cking> it was ~7 months ago since I last looked at the code, so I can't recall off the top of my head
[18:01] <plars> np
[18:04] <cking> plars, i'm kind of not an autotest expert, so I'm not sure where it dumps the output, but I suspect it should appear in the directory created where the tests are run
[18:05] <plars> cking: I just responded and included brad/steve in case they happen to know, otherwise I'll just try it manually and see where the tests go, but I'm traveling right now and might be quicker if someone just "knows" :)
[18:05] <cking> plars, ok - thanks!
[18:05] <plars> cking: thanks for the heads up about that log file though, that is *certainly* something tha needs to be gathered in every run
[18:06] <cking> indeed, it would be useful :-)

[19:38] <balloons> thomi, yes your correct
[19:39] <balloons> it was more that it couldn't handle statically linked stuff.. but not many things are ;-)
[19:40] <balloons> although, heh, Error: Could not determine introspection type to use for application '/usr/lib/firefox/firefox'.
[20:06] <letozaf_> Hi balloons
[20:06] <balloons> howdy
[20:06] <letozaf_> I tried the evince test
[20:06] <letozaf_> I only got one failure
[20:07] <letozaf_> do you want the output ?
[20:07] <letozaf_> balloons, I'me fine and you ?
[20:09] <balloons> letozaf_, what was the failure
[20:09] <letozaf_> balloons, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1542440
[20:09] <balloons> I'm a bit off today tbh ;-|
[20:10] <balloons> ohh.. you can fix that error eh?
[20:10] <letozaf_> balloons, sure I will try :)
[20:14] <balloons> looks like just need to compare the short filename, not the full directory+filename
=== salem_` is now known as _salem
[20:20] <letozaf_> balloons, thanks, I fixed it :)
[20:21] <balloons> good work..
[20:21] <balloons> so I updated the trello board
[20:21] <letozaf_> balloons, yep I saw the emails
[20:21] <letozaf_> notification emails
[20:21] <balloons> I added your 'face' to the ones you were working on :-)
[20:21] <letozaf_> balloons, :) thanks

[20:31] <balloons> k, i'll merge in a bit
[20:48] <balloons> hmm thomi, I'm going through trying to launch some random apps and getting some errors, or app crashes.. I'll try and consolidate the results and then ping you and see if any bugs need to be filed
[20:48] <balloons> sorry, context.. using autopilot launch
=== Ursinha is now known as Ursinha-afk
[21:00] <dkessel> do any of you have graphics flickering in the dash with the current packages?
[21:01] <balloons> dkessel, no.. what graphics/drivers?
[21:02] <balloons> though, I do need to restart to see the new xserver stuff
[21:02] <dkessel> intel... checking which
[21:03] <dkessel> 00:02.1 Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/GME, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
[21:03] <dkessel> one of my netbooks
[21:03] <balloons> ohh.. nvm, it's pixbuf libs
[21:04] <balloons> anyways, I'm on amd, open drivers
[21:06] <letozaf_> dkessel, I have a notebook with intel graphics card
[21:06] <letozaf_> dkessel, but no flickering
[21:06] <letozaf_> dkessel, driver: i915
[21:13] <dkessel> balloons, have you ever forwarded a kernel driver issue upstream? not talking about the graphics ;) but about about a bluetooth bug if filed yesterday...
[21:13] <balloons> dkessel, yes.. although it was not me who did so.. we worked through the kernel team
[21:14] <dkessel> specifically, i wonder if it would be alright to link from the mail to the mailing list to the launchpad bug...
[21:14] <balloons> if you file a good bug and sub me, I can help make sure it gets reviewed.. but those guys are good about following up on bugs
[21:14] <balloons> dkessel, what do you mean about linking?
[21:14] <balloons> you lost me there
[21:15] <dkessel> i have filed bug 1100004 yesterday
[21:16] <ubot5> bug 1100004 in linux (Ubuntu) "compal-laptop reports bluetooth device, even if there is none" [Medium,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100004
[21:16] <dkessel> ...and been through a session of "run the mainline kernel" :)
[21:18] <balloons> ah yes, it takes some fun stuff to triage down kernel bugs
[21:18]  * balloons reads
[21:18] <dkessel> so... i understood the stuff on the wiki page
[21:19] <balloons> ahh.. yes, keep going
[21:19] <balloons> looks good thus far
[21:19] <balloons> once fixed upstream, the kernel team will pull something for you to test
[21:19] <dkessel> but if i send a mail to the maintainer mailing list, do i send a reference to the launchpad page in the mail? i don't want to include all the BIOS files and stuff again....
[21:21] <balloons> yes, you can reference the bug report you filed
[21:21] <balloons> they may ask you to do some other things, but hopefully not
[21:22] <balloons> there biggest beef is making sure you tried on a vanilla upstream kernel
[21:22] <balloons> they don't like distro-level bugs
[21:22] <balloons> for obvious reasons :-)
[21:22] <dkessel> yeah, i did and i will show them uname -a :)
[21:23] <dkessel> ok, i will work on that mail on sunday then, i guess.
[21:24] <dkessel> hm. probably a bad time to ask in #u-devel about the graphics flickering...
[21:25] <dkessel> letozaf_, you're so silent. i bet you're working on autopilot tests again ;)
[21:25] <letozaf_> dkessel, yep :)
[21:26] <letozaf_> dkessel, just trying to figure out the new things balloons did
[21:26] <letozaf_> dkessel, what about you ?
[21:27] <dkessel> trying to find out more about my graphics bug... not up to coding in the last days... work is too tiring atm
[21:29] <letozaf_> dkessel, :)
[21:30] <letozaf_> dkessel, is your cat still watching TV :)
[21:32] <dkessel> letozaf_, no, she's lying in the basket now, relaxing... after having her wild five minutes just a few minutes ago
[21:32] <letozaf_> dkessel, :D
[21:33] <dkessel> letozaf_, do you have a cat too?
[21:33] <letozaf_> dkessel, no, no pets :(
[21:36] <dkessel> need to reboot for graphics driver reset...
[21:40] <letozaf_> balloons, I noticed a strange thing looking at autopilot nautilus test
=== Ursinha-afk is now known as Ursinha
[21:40] <balloons> the nautilus one is a bit annoying.. it's off
[21:40] <letozaf_> should I let go ?
[21:40] <balloons> I tried doing a piece of it and got a werid error so I left it
[21:41] <balloons> no no.. the manual testcase is outdaed now
[21:41] <balloons> nautilus has changed a bit
[21:41] <letozaf_> anyway I noticed that if you type nautilus in terminal on Quantal nautilus window opens and is focused, if you type it in Raring it doesn't
[21:42] <balloons> yes ,i notied too
[21:42] <balloons> the focus is weird
[21:42] <letozaf_> but could this be a bug ?
[21:42]  * dkessel types 'ubuntu-bug xorg'
[21:44] <balloons> letozaf_, not sure actually
[21:44] <balloons> nautilus is being held back
[21:44] <balloons> or was.. because of the upstream changes
[21:45] <letozaf_> balloons, ok, I will try something else :)
[21:46] <balloons> yes, so i consider it weird
[21:46] <balloons> and would focus on other things atm
[21:47] <letozaf_> balloons, ok
[21:48] <letozaf_> balloons, but for intance, shotwell, how are we going to test the camera plug in with autopilot ?
[21:49] <balloons> sadly, we can't really
[21:49] <balloons> we could explore semi-automated stuff
[21:49] <balloons> you plug in the camera, then run the test
[21:49] <letozaf_> balloons, ah! ok that's fine I think
[21:49] <balloons> and since for now we are allowing ourselves to be the test runners, that works
[21:50] <letozaf_> letozaf_, maybe I will give it a try
[21:50] <balloons> yes, you should be able to write the test with the assumption the camera is plugged in.. I believe
[21:51] <balloons> however, eventually we'll be gettig these tests automatically run on new images, so something like that wouldn't work in that case
[21:53] <letozaf_> balloons, do you think I should give it a try or should I change application ?
[21:55] <balloons> letozaf_, you sure can.. there's many options.. work on something you like :-)
[21:55] <balloons> I enjoyed writing the manual testcases for shotwell
[21:55] <balloons> you can improve them I'm sure :-)
[21:57] <letozaf_> balloons, ok, let's give it a try
[22:04] <letozaf_> night guys going to bed :-z
[22:11] <dkessel> yeah, bye from me too... good night
