[00:02] <k1l> mattwj2002: phones with ubuntu-phone are not to be expected before 2014. so that whole thing is just starting roght now

[11:26] <dpm> hi bzoltan good morning!, it seems currently the UI toolkit is not installable in Raring: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-ui-toolkit/+bug/1104311 - do you think someone could look into it? Once the issue is well understood, perhaps we could ask someone from the community to help fixing it.

[15:04] <funky1> hi all :) was wondering if special apps need to be developed for this or will i be able to run regular linux/ubuntu software on my phone?
[15:04] <funky1> does anyone know?
[15:05] <funky1> ok on the wiki it states this:
[15:05] <funky1> When the phone is docked to a screen you should be able to use the full desktop applications. When they are on the small screen they would need a QML display which might be part of the same application.
[15:06] <funky1> so is it save to assume that command line application will work without a problem and software with guis might require extra coding to adjust to screen when not used with an external screen?
[15:06] <ajalkane> yes
[15:08] <funky1> okey, thanks ajalkane :)
