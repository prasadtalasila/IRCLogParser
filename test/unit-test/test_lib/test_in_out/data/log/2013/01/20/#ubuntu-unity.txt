[15:19] <Controlsfreek> Hi all- I'm still having trouble building unity- even after a successful build of nux: http://pastebin.com/rnuh7GZf
[16:54] <rperier> Controlsfreek: did you execute "unity-env" before ?
[16:55] <rperier> it's required, because this function export a variable called PKGCONFIG_PATH which is used to detect the right version of nux installed into $HOME/staging :)
[16:55] <rperier> exports*
[16:56] <rperier> so "unity-env; remake-unity" should work
[23:01] <Controlsfreek> rperier, YES that worked. Thank you. I thought i had earlier in the setup process... apparently not! Its building right now.
