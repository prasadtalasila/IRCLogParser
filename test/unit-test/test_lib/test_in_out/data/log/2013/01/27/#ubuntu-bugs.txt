[18:46] <zequence> Hi. Was looking to get this SRU'd lp:#956438
[18:47] <zequence> I patched jackd2 for raring
[18:47] <penguin42> bug 956438
[18:47] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 956438 in jackd2 (Ubuntu) "qjackctl unable to stop jackd2" [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/956438
[18:47] <zequence> jackd2 has since been updated, but I'd like to SRU the patch only
[18:49] <penguin42> zequence: So it's fixed on raring but broken on quantal and precise?
[18:50] <zequence> penguin42: Yes
[18:50] <zequence> However, the current version in Raring, while fixing the bug as well, would depend on newer packages, so that's why it seems most appropriate to only SRU the patch
[18:51] <zequence> Or, the version of the package with the patch, that is
[18:52]  * penguin42 isn't sure I've done that right - I hit the target for and selected Precise-updates, not sure if that's right though
[19:35] <schallusion> hi, after upgrading to the new kernel (3.2.0.-36) yesterday, my wlan stoped working. It is a Broadcom BCM 4313 device. any idea what could have gone wrong?
[19:37] <schallusion> iam using 12.04.1
[19:50] <zequence> schallusion: Try googling it. Else, make a bug report.
