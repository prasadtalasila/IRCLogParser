[00:00] <TimeRider_UK> BroUnicorn : not sure if'll help, but http://lifehacker.com/5934942/how-to-dual-boot-linux-on-your-mac-and-take-back-your-powerhouse-apple-hardware looks like it describes your situation
[00:00] <Xeago> with proper port forwarding I cannot access it from wan
[00:00] <Xeago> ufw is disabled and iptables -L gives empty tables
[00:00] <tekk> ok, thanks for the advice, besides plugging in various dongles to different machines, can you recommend some kind of  multiple dongles to a single wifi device that is purchasable?
[00:00] <ubuntu-tester1> ero-jiji: sorry, chmod -R o+r /path/to/folder
[00:00] <ero-jiji> @ubuntu-tester1 thanks, never thought of that /smacks head
[00:02] <slowwritespeed> am so confused, in gpart, there is like amiga, sun, loop, pc98, msdos, gpt, etc and i dont know which one to do
[00:02] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: how are you trying and what's output
[00:02] <tekk> slowwritespeed, depends on the use/purpose etc
[00:02] <tekk> got or msdos are the 2 to focus on
[00:02] <ubuntu-tester1> slowwritespeed: it depends on purpose
[00:02] <tekk> gpt*
[00:03] <slowwritespeed> microSD -  installing ubuntu , persistent storage
[00:03] <orbitwhite> tekk, there r solutions that used as voip gateways, like for example http://www.addpac.com/addpac_eng2/addpac_product_view_detail.php?class_id=100001&item_id=706 but i don't know anything beyond that it exists
[00:03] <slowwritespeed> I just wanna format it from FAT to ext4..
[00:03] <tekk> thanks guys
[00:03] <slowwritespeed> do I even need to do this?
[00:03] <tekk> slowwritespeed, is it a boot drive or secondary?
[00:03] <ubuntu-tester1> slowwritespeed: FAT32 i think
[00:03] <tekk> if secondary i'd recommend GPT
[00:04] <tekk> if modern hardware i'd recommend GPT all the way...
[00:04] <TheNoobyPro> h
[00:04] <tekk> msdos as fdisk likes to call it… doesn't really support modern features of disks and modern use cases
[00:05] <Xeago> basically ssh from another network doesn't work
[00:05] <slowwritespeed> the problem is... it doesn't matter what i do.. whenever i format to anything.. I go to startup disc utility thing in ubuntu...and it wants me to erase disc...and everytime i do.. goes back to FAT @_@ .........
[00:05] <TheNoobyPro> Hi, I'm experiencing a bit of a problem with Ubuntu. I have a lot of lag when opening the Dash Home. I don't know if it's my GPU, it's an old GeForce 7300 LE, but I've used it on Linux Mint and it performs well.
[00:05] <Xeago> ssh from local network (via another host on the network) without problems
[00:05] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: tomeout?
[00:05] <Xeago> time-out yes
[00:05] <tekk> slowwritespeed, are you using ubuntu server or desktop?
[00:05] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: *timeout
[00:05] <slowwritespeed> desktop
[00:05] <slowwritespeed> 32bit
[00:05] <wagle> 12.10, connecting to samba server.  if I click on "homes", it doesn't let me specify a loginname/password to try logging in as?  how do i get it to work like macosx and win7?
[00:05] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: ping?
[00:05] <orbitwhite> i'm just curious if anyone used to boot from microsd card blugged into usb reader adapter dongle
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:06] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: router ping?
[00:06] <tekk> slowwritespeed, try launching gparted, its a nice visual interface to parted etc… makes life a bit easy, under the menu you'll find Device -> Create Partition Table
[00:06] <tekk> from there you can create new partitions and format them to ext4 or your desired fs
[00:06] <Xeago> I don't forward ping, I can ping the router locally (disabled at wan) pinging the broadcast does not include the host, pinging the ip directly does include the host
[00:06] <ubuntu-tester1> orbitwhite: i did, what's a problem
[00:07] <Xeago> (e.g. ping 192.168.0.255 only shows me, 192.168.0.123 shows ubuntu host)
[00:07] <slowwritespeed> and please don't tell me to do terminal commands, it never works :p...and I know my passward... whenever i installing apps from ubuntu store and it asks for password.. it always works... but when i do a sudo command it terminal...and it asks for password and enter it... always says incorrect :/
[00:07] <Xeago> and the router responds at lan just fine aswell
[00:07] <tekk> slowwritespeed, gparted should be available from the menu… and i hate to say it, but if you're scared of terminal commands… perhaps you shouldn't be using ubuntu
[00:08] <slowwritespeed> tekk: but is Creating a Partition Table neccessary? Can ext4 work on msdos parition or no?
[00:08] <orbitwhite> ubuntu-tester1, i tried it once and the problem is that grub didn't start for some reason while it was "somewhat properly installed", maybe dongle itself was a problem?
[00:08] <tekk> slowwritespeed, yes it can, but if you have a larger than 2.5tb drive, you'll experience strange behaviour depending on your spin of ext4
[00:08] <orbitwhite> maybe u could tell which one u were using so i could remember it just in case
[00:08] <tekk> but creating a partition table isn''t a big deal
[00:09] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: check if sshd is really listening on the port
[00:09] <Xeago> I can connect to it fine from other hosts in the network
[00:09] <playonlinux_need> Heyas
[00:09] <playonlinux_need> Can anybody help me with a question on an error when trying to use the program playonlinux?
[00:09] <slowwritespeed> k... maybe its not the format thats giving me issue.. but installing ubuntu on SD...how? what tool? i think the startup utility giving me issues.. no matter what i do in gpart.
[00:09] <ikonia> the playonlinux guys can help
[00:09] <ubuntu-tester1> orbitwhite: some BIOSes can't boot from secondary USB devices
[00:09] <ikonia> it's a comercial product
[00:10] <playonlinux_need> Oh ok. Can I find them here on IRC?
[00:10] <ikonia> or is it?
[00:10] <Xeago> I think playonlinux is just a wine wrapper
[00:10] <tekk> you wanna install ubuntu on an SD card?
[00:10] <orbitwhite> ubuntu-tester1, maybe it is the case, but it was on a list like of that "f8 menu" where u pick the boot device lol
[00:10] <tekk> booting from that will depend on your BIOS/efi and also… it'll be shit slow
[00:10] <ikonia> sorry, I was thinking of crossover
[00:10] <JonEdney> playonlinux_need, try #playonlinux
[00:11] <playonlinux_need> Alright, thanks JonEdney :)
[00:11] <ubuntu-tester1> slowwritespeed: if you won't insist on ext4, things will go smoother...
[00:11] <orbitwhite> tekk, nope just was curious to have bootloader on microsd card
[00:11] <tekk> well you can orbitwhite… but its not gonna be great
[00:11] <tekk> if you wanna run ubuntu on some portable flash
[00:11] <tekk> then get a fast(ish) usb 3.0 thumb drive
[00:12] <tekk> microsd and the likes have really bad IOPS
[00:12] <sebastiansam55> what is a current audacity like program?
[00:12] <orbitwhite> tekk, i want to carry my bootloader and keys for luks-encrypted instance on microsd
[00:12] <AndChat504> Can some one please help me, i need to add nomodeset into grub... i can only boot into grub and i dont know to to work it
[00:12] <orbitwhite> thats all
[00:12] <tekk> ah, shouldn't be an issue then
[00:12] <sebastiansam55> or is audacity still one of the better ones around?
[00:12] <tekk> but BIOS dependent of course
[00:12] <ubuntu-tester1> orbitwhite: yes it may be in the list but not boot. i have two laptops an one boots and the other not
[00:12] <tekk> most do IDE emulation for SD
[00:12] <komputes> SebastianFlyte: what does it lack?
[00:12] <orbitwhite> sd won't fit, my sd port depends on firmware
[00:12] <komputes> sebastiansam55: : what does it lack?
[00:13] <orbitwhite> so it doesn't work at that state when everything boots up
[00:13] <sebastiansam55> well i don't know i was wondering if there were any better programs than audacity
[00:13] <orbitwhite> i guess ubuntu-tester1 is right and its just a bios issue because i'm 100% sure grub was installed correctly on that microsd i tried
[00:13] <sebastiansam55> really have no idea bout this stuff seeing if anyone here knew bout anythin
[00:13] <AndChat504> Can someone help me edit grub from inside of grub
[00:13] <orbitwhite> another reason could be that chinese usb dongle as microsd card reader adapter
[00:14] <tekk> orbitwhite, if booting with the card reader connected and card present, does it show up in your BIOS as a boot device / hard drive?
[00:14] <iceroot> AndChat504: press "e" when you are on an entry in the grub menu, after that press "b" to press the changed line
[00:14] <iceroot> !grub2 | AndChat504
[00:14] <ubottu> AndChat504: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[00:14] <ubuntu-tester1> slowwritespeed: it may also depend on SD size. smaller ones have more chances i guess
[00:14] <orbitwhite> tekk, yup
[00:14] <tekk> orbitwhite, you should be able to load your boot loader from it then
[00:14] <tekk> and point it to a physical hard disk
[00:15] <orbitwhite> but even hardware id is different to microsd card itself because there is another supah adapter that shows ids for cards that plugged
[00:15] <tekk> hkmm
[00:15] <orbitwhite> so it makes me think that dongle could be a problem otherwise its a bios issue
[00:15] <tekk> yeah, one characteristic of the SD spec is… not all readers follow it properly
[00:15] <tekk> heh
[00:15] <orbitwhite> as mentioned above
[00:15] <tekk> if you buy say… SUPERCHINABRAND SD CARD READEr
[00:16] <tekk> the device will show as SUPERCHINABRAND SD CARD READER 4GB
[00:16] <tekk> feather than SanDisk Extreme 4GB
[00:16] <tekk> labels get fucked up
[00:16] <ubuntu-tester1> slowwritespeed: sorry, it was intended for orbitwhite
[00:16] <Xeago> ufw and iptables are not interfering either

[00:16] <ubottu> tekk: Please watch your language and topic to help keep this channel family-friendly, polite, and professional.
[00:16] <orbitwhite> the problem is that only chinese dudes produce such small dongles lol
[00:16] <AndChat504> Iceroot: how do i pull up the boot file or w/e it is in grub ubuntu is booting into black screen.  I need to add "quite splash nomodeset"
[00:16] <orbitwhite> as far as i've seen
[00:16] <tekk> but if using got won't the label come from the bytes in partition table rather than hardware?
[00:16] <tekk> im not sure
[00:17] <orbitwhite> ubuntu-tester1, tried 64mb one =)
[00:17] <AndChat504> Iceroot: i dont even know where to begin inside of grub
[00:17] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: then it must be a router problem
[00:17] <tekk> anyways, netflix time for me
[00:17] <tekk> ciao
[00:17] <orbitwhite> good luck =)
[00:18] <Sgt_Shultz> tekk & or Orbitwhite , Can u make a ubuntu "tiny" install like dslinux ? (damm small linux) that will run off a 64 meg usb ..key
[00:19] <ubuntu-tester1> Xeago: check forwarding setup, remove and re-add it, try another port
[00:19] <orbitwhite> Sgt_Shultz, i was never curious
[00:19] <orbitwhite> Sgt_Shultz, just need a bootloader stored in there and working

[00:51] <Mrokii> Hello. What could be the reason that my usb webcam isn't detected by the system or the usb-hub? It has been working just some days ago...

[00:53] <phunyguy> ubuntu-tester1, I can try static config but it is not ideal.  Syslog tells me that the DHCPOFFER comes in, but then i get a DHCP timeout after that
[00:54] <ubuntu-tester1> Mrokii: pastebin what appears in syslog in 30 sec after plugging it in

=== tjbiddle_ is now known as tjbiddle
[00:57] <phunyguy> ubuntu-tester1, yes.  No other devices fail to receive an IP, but the reason I suspect hardware still, is I used to have a PC plugged into that port which did the exact same thing, just once in a while, not all the time.
[00:57] <phunyguy> such an odd issue.
[00:57] <orbitwhite> and why settin it manually is not an option?
[00:58] <phunyguy> I think I am going to get in my attic this weekend and run another cat5e cable, but this time to my wifi AP, which has a 4 port switch as well.  That way I can make that the main switch for the house, and I KNOW that one works fine.
[00:58] <phunyguy> orbitwhite, never said it wasn't an option, just not ideal.
[00:58] <orbitwhite> oh ok
[00:59] <phunyguy> also it seems to pick up a different IP on the lease when it tries and fails

[01:01] <Hans_Henrik> question, why is pastebinit_1.3-2ubuntu3_all.deb  's default pastebinit   paste.debian.org  ? (when there is a paste.ubuntu.com  :p )
[01:01] <orbitwhite> tony1, is it the case? http://superuser.com/questions/173179/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-10
[01:02] <phunyguy> ubuntu-tester1, I doubt that.  It is a full on security appliance
[01:02] <phunyguy> not a home router
[01:02] <orbitwhite> first link on google
[01:02] <Mrokii> orbitwhite: How should I know?
[01:02] <memand> would someone write me a msg, I need to test something?
[01:02] <ubuntu-tester1> !ask | ashamed
[01:02] <ubottu> ashamed: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[01:02] <dr_willis> ashamed: theres a nautilus scripting feature that may do what you want
[01:02] <ashamed> dr_willis: link, please?
[01:03] <dr_willis> ashamed: it adds right ckick items to files
[01:03] <Hans_Henrik> is there any alternative to pastebinit  btw?
[01:03] <Hans_Henrik> having issues with it.. it fails "echo test | pastebinit"  for example x.x
[01:03] <dr_willis> ashamed: no idea. it has a site of examples
[01:03] <Mrokii> ubuntu-tester1: How exactly do I check the syslog?
[01:03] <tony1> orbitwhite my case is the same
[01:04] <tony1> u right
[01:04] <ashamed> dr_willis, the issue is more that many HP laptops don't register the right-click. I'm thinking that there's some kind of key-combo click you can do instead?
[01:04] <ashamed> Like, on a Mac, it's ctrl-click.
[01:04] <Midec> I'm performing a clean install of ubuntu 12.04 and i have some questions regarding partitions.  I know i need to have a '/ partition' and a 'swap partition', what do i do with the rest of the HDD(i will only be using linux, will not be dual booting)  please  and thank you.
[01:04] <dr_willis> ashamed: thats a totally different thing then.
[01:04] <orbitwhite> tony1, google halps in most cases, use it ;)
[01:04] <memand> !ask | memand
[01:04] <ubottu> memand, please see my private message
[01:04] <Hans_Henrik> afaik, a swap partition is optional :o
[01:05] <Hans_Henrik> (but often recommended)
[01:05] <dr_willis> swap is optional... but reccomend
[01:05] <qwiksilver711> all nvidia drivers are current and ubuntu doesnt detect my display thats running through hdmi
[01:05] <ashamed> dr_willis: I just want to make the context menus show up. It doesn't matter if I right click to do it, or ctrl-click to do it... I just need to know how to do it.
[01:06] <ubuntu-tester1> Mrokii: in terminal, run tail -f /var/log/syslog, plug the camera, wait, press Ctrl+C in terminal, copy output
[01:06] <Midec> well I have 500 gb, how should i allocate it?  i have 4gb ram, so im going to allocate 8024mb to swap, and i read online to put roughly 10-25gb into the / partition, what do i do with the rest of it? leave it as free space?

[01:06] <ubuntu-tester1> Mrokii: paste to pastebin, not here
[01:06] <ashamed> Will do. But... how do YOU get context menus?
[01:07] <dr_willis> ashamed:  i just right  click...
[01:07] <ashamed> dr_willis: OK, thanks! So there's no secret combo... I just need to troubleshoot.
[01:07] <ashamed> I'll try your suggestion, thanks!
[01:08] <ubuntu-tester1> Midec: alocate and mount it to /home
[01:09] <ubuntu-tester1> Midec: or leave unallocated to have some flexibility in the future

[01:19] <Quinn_> Hello everyone
[01:19] <ubuntu-tester1> Quinn_: hi
[01:19] <Quinn_> I'd like to test out the propietary driver for my Radeon 6290 on Ubuntu 12.10 in a live USB environment. How can I do this?
[01:21] <orbitwhite> good question lol
[01:22] <Quinn_> Okay, if anyone knows, please let me know :)
[01:26] <schmitt953> hi, so I am installing a 12.10 ubuntu server guest in kvm, for some reason the bootloader loads but then the screen in the virtual terminal is just black
[01:26] <schmitt953> any ideas?
[01:26] <Midec> I'm doing a clean install of 12.04 and im currently setting up the partitions, I am going to put 8Gb into the swap, 25gb into the / folder, but what do I do with the rest of the space?  it's a 500gb HDD, so what do I do with the remaining 467gb of HDD?  leave it as free space?  (i will not be dual booting)
[01:27] <orbitwhite> Midec, what amount of ram ur machine has?
[01:27] <ubuntu-tester1> Midec: see my last answer
[01:27] <Midec> orbitwhite, 4gb, I read online that you should double that if you have the space
[01:28] <orbitwhite> u won't need such a huge swap in that case
[01:28] <orbitwhite> Midec, consider this rule as recommendation only, until its above 1gb
[01:28] <orbitwhite> 2G should be enough for sure i assume
[01:28] <schmitt953> sorry I did something dumb and suspended the laptop
[01:29] <Midec> ubuntu-tester1, ah gotcha, so allocate the rest as /home?
[01:29] <ubuntu-tester1> Midec: or leave unallocated if you don't need it now
[01:30] <orbitwhite> Midec, u can cut / to 12 gb and to map the rest of space for /home
[01:30] <orbitwhite> if u don't plan for dual-boot for sure
[01:30] <Midec> ubuntu-tester1, so i'll have 25Gb in  '/', 467Gb in '/home', and 8Gb in 'swap',   ?
[01:30] <Midec> orbitwhite, nope, if i need to use windows, i'll just run a VM
[01:30] <ubuntu-tester1> Midec: yes
[01:31] <orbitwhite> D:
[01:31] <Mrokii> ubuntu-tester1: Guess, the restart resolved the issue. Thanks again.
[01:32] <Midec> ubuntu-tester1, thank you so much, i just spent 5 hours trying to figure out why I had a 'input/output error during read on /dev/sda"  It was I had my HDD locked in bios, I cleared that and it solved it. I am exhausted. So again, thank you very much.
[01:32] <lee8oi> Whats the best say to set the menu on the top panel bar to always-visible?
[01:32] <ubuntu-tester1> !nox | schmitt953
[01:32] <ubottu> schmitt953: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode

[01:53] <_helios_> ty bazhang
[01:53] <lee8oi> well, I can see unity is making strides of improvement. But I'm sad I can't make that menu bar stay visible. Its a deal breaker because its annoying that I can't see it.
[01:54] <_helios_> lee8oi, what menu bar?
[01:54] <dr_willis> lee8oi:  what menu bar are you refering to
[01:54] <lee8oi> top one
[01:54] <_helios_> lee8oi, it should be staying visible.
[01:54] <lee8oi> the one that you gotta hover to see
[01:54] <lee8oi> not the panel, the menu
[01:54] <dr_willis> You wan tto always see the  file.. open .. settings.. type menu entriss?
[01:54] <lee8oi> window menus
[01:54] <lee8oi> yea
[01:54] <psusi> that and the fact that even non maximized windows get their menu sucked up there, and you can't minimize windows by clicking the icon on the dock... very annoying
[01:55] <dr_willis> lee8oi:  its designed to hide them, so you can see the actual window title.
[01:55] <_helios_> lee8oi, it does that because all menus from other applications are integrated into the top menu like on a mac os.
[01:55] <dr_willis> check into global menu tweaks/settings perhaps
[01:55] <ubuntu-tester1> lee8oi: pressing Alt+F or Alt+H can be a palliative
[01:55] <lee8oi> there's enough room for both
[01:55] <psusi> can see the actual window title at the top of the window for non maaximized windows
[01:55] <dr_willis> lee8oi:  not on my netbook
[01:55] <dr_willis> theres also ways to disable the global menu
[01:55] <lee8oi> I'd rather have the menu than the title anyways. I got the window for all that.
[01:56] <lee8oi> I don't need the title of the program to use it, just a launcher icon and a damn window menu
[01:56] <psusi> and actually unity doesn't show the title, just the name of the app, which is kind of silly too
[01:56] <_helios_> lee8oi, the menu will auto hide not just for the title but for other reasons, like when you switch an application etc.
[01:56] <psusi> at least for non maximized windows
[01:57] <lee8oi> Well its annoying. I'm going to see about putting Cinnamon on here. That's less annoying.
[01:57] <psusi> gnome-shell?
[01:57] <dr_willis> cinnamon can break your system.. good luck
[01:57] <lee8oi> break? ba
[01:57] <_helios_> I think it's a good idea to hide the menu until it is needed,  Actualy I love that that is why I switched back to Ubuntu from Xubuntu just for that reason...lol
[01:57] <psusi> it's a great idea... for maximized windows... sucks otherwise
[01:57] <lee8oi> you got used to it, but I use my menu's a lot
=== orbitwhite is now known as Daniel_rocka
[01:57] <_helios_> lee8oi, if you switch to Xubuntu which is a good desktop manager it always shows menu's the old fashion way.
[01:58] <dr_willis> learn  to use the HUD if you use menus a lot. its designed to make menu access faster
[01:58] <psusi> HUD?
[01:58] <lee8oi> well yea I'm familiar with all the desktops. I mainly hopped back to ubuntu to stay with the gaming trends
[01:58] <dr_willis> the HUD iis an easyaly overlooked feature
[01:58] <dr_willis> !hud
[01:58] <lee8oi> I don't mind the hud, I just want the dam window menus to stay visible.
[01:58] <dr_willis> Hmm. no factoud. check out videos of it in use on youtube and the blog sites like webupd8 and omgubuntu
[01:59] <lee8oi> even back on the windows for all I care
[01:59] <dr_willis> lee8oi:   look in to the globasl menu tweaks and  perhaps disable it.. guides out there.
[01:59] <_helios_> lee8oi, switch to Xubuntu it has menu's always visible on the actual window.
[01:59] <sean_> i need girlfriends .
[01:59] <lee8oi> global menu? is that what its called?
[02:00] <lee8oi> get over the xubuntu :P
[02:00] <dr_willis> lee8oi:  yes.. ive been calling it the global menu for some time now. ;:)
[02:00] <_helios_> lee8oi, but you will loose all the eye candy of Ubuntu and it is sexy.
[02:00] <dr_willis> global menu can be disabled on a per app  basis, or competley
[02:00] <lee8oi> ok disabling global menu, thats my next step.
[02:00] <ubuntu-tester1> lee8oi: if you use it a lot, i bet you should remember it, top level at least :)
[02:00] <psusi> I just don't understand why they can't only use the global menu for maximized windows

[02:06] <dr_willis> its not SUPPORT related so its spam in here..

[02:07] <lee8oi> fat lotta good that did. Some dudes idea of removing the menu was to remove the appmenu packages
[02:07] <lee8oi> menu still up there
[02:07] <Ziber> Speaking of support related, know about mysql-server package being broken in 12.04?
[02:08] <dr_willis> i belive the omgubuntu or webupd8 site had a guide on tweaking the 'global menu'
[02:08] <ikonia> in what way broken
[02:08] <Ziber> ikonia: Not starting, tables in mysql.* arriving corrupt.
[02:08] <_helios_> Alright guys I'll prob be on tomorrow ttyl ;)
[02:08] <BlackDalek> Speaking of support related..... Where in god's name do I find custom colour congifurations which Unity unfortunately imported from old gnome 2 custom colour config in my wife's PC when she upgraded from ubuntu  11.04 to 12.04?
[02:08] <lee8oi> I really hope Ikey gets the Solus desktop tweaks setup so we can use them in Ubuntu.
[02:08] <ikonia> Ziber: it's certainly not a broken package
[02:09] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: not actually free, paid in fb likes :)
[02:09] <Ziber> ikonia: I beg to differ.
[02:09] <Ziber> It seems to be very broken, freshly installed two 12.04 lts VMs, same issue with the package on both.
[02:09] <ikonia> Ziber: `lets see.......thousands of people install the same package, myself included, no problem, you install the package, it's got corrupt tables.....what do you think the problem is
[02:09] <ConGiun> hey guys
[02:09] <dr_willis> Its very likely its a issue with the VPN/VMS service
[02:10] <ikonia> Ziber: what makes you think the tables are corrupt ?
=== me is now known as Guest90036
[02:10] <Ziber> ikonia: Other than syslog saying they were and running mysql with the option to ignore privleges saying that the host.MYI was not a valid format?
[02:10] <BlackDalek> I need to know how to remove custom colour configuration, because currently Unity wants to make all top of screen menus in black on black and icon text in black... Where do I find custom colour configs so I can delete them? I can find no way to change the font colours etc...
[02:11] <ikonia> Ziber: I suspect the syslog doesn't actually say the tables are corrupt,
[02:11] <Ziber> ikonia: One sec. I'll show you.
[02:11] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  used to be a tweaktool for that. but i caant recall if it was 'myunity' or some other named tool
[02:11] <ikonia> Ziber: and mysql will only run skipping grant tables if you tell it to, it does not fall back to it
[02:12] <Ben65> i'd vote the problem is either the user, or the host that receives payment in "likes"
[02:12] <lee8oi> hmm 'kubuntu-low-fat-settings' package
[02:12] <BlackDalek> dr_willis, already tried that - myunity has no options at all for configuring colours of a theme.
[02:12] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  perhapos it was gnome-tweak or in ubuntu-tweak. im not on a ubuntu box to look.
[02:12] <ubuntu-tester1> BlackDalek: system settings -> appearance -> theme
[02:13] <zebaszp> hey, does anyone know if/when Upstart will be replaced with systemd?
[02:13] <Ziber> ikonia: Yes, I know. I did it manually
[02:13] <dr_willis> zebaszp:  from what ive read. not for a few releases yet.
[02:13] <dr_willis> zebaszp:  but they have been known to get radical with non lts releases
[02:13] <BlackDalek> ubuntu-tester1, that is also equally useless... that only allows choice of theme, but no way to fix colours which were changed in gnome 2
[02:14] <zebaszp> dr_willis: hopefully 14.04 will be systemd?
[02:14] <Ben65> much too soon to speculate
[02:14] <lee8oi> Unity desperately needs configurability. These extra tools are cool but its getting messy having to search through multiple tools to tweak everything.
=== mike is now known as Guest54332
[02:14] <ikonia> zebaszp: it's not on the roadmap yet - so it's a pointless discussion
[02:14] <Ben65> lee8oi: thats why i don't use it
[02:14] <lee8oi> I'm installing kubuntu-desktop as we speak :)
[02:14] <zebaszp> I'm a little more anxious about Wayland, though, but I'd guess that's gonna take longer than a year
[02:14] <dr_willis> or go back to some default theme...
[02:15] <ubuntu-tester1> BlackDalek: if you change theme and change back, it get reset to default colors, no?
[02:15] <Ben65> nvidia isn't on board with wayland
[02:15] <zebaszp> I know
[02:15] <dr_willis> i find that often end user tweaking configurability - causes many of the issues
[02:15] <BlackDalek> What I really need to know if the location of customised theme colours because unity has obviously imported them from somewhere... so far no one seems to know where. I tried switching themes, but the messed up colour config seems to stick..
[02:16] <zebaszp> but for one thing, Gallium3D driver are quite something right now, and Nvidia's plans are far from predictable after this whole Steam on Linux thing
[02:16] <Ziber> ikonia: http://pastebin.com/f0S5LnYj
[02:16] <BlackDalek> ubuntu-tester1, no, it doesn't. :( customized colours are stuck
[02:16] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  in .config or .gnome* or .gtk*    would  be my guess.. look for files that are owned by root.. that can cause weird issues
[02:16] <dr_willis> BlackDalek:  such as a user not being able to change a setting
[02:16] <ikonia> Ziber: why are you not using the init script to run it
[02:16] <Ziber> ikonia: This is a freshly installed system, running 12.04 lts, installed yesterday.
[02:16] <ikonia> and why are you root
[02:16] <Ziber> ikonia: Because it doesn't run if I do that.
[02:17] <Ziber> ikonia: Because I wanted to run a few commands for which I'd need to sudo and running sudo -i was easier.
[02:17] <ikonia> InnoDB: The log sequence number in ibdata files does not match
[02:17] <ikonia> InnoDB: the log sequence number in the ib_logfiles!
[02:17] <ikonia> 130115 21:12:06  InnoDB: Database was not shut down normally!
[02:17] <ikonia> Ziber: the database was started - someone shut it down in a mess
[02:17] <ConGiun> wat problem
[02:17] <ikonia> Ziber: I would check the repository you are pulling mysql from, that is not ubuntu's mysql-server's package behaviour
[02:17] <Ziber> ikonia: I'm telling you, this was a freshly installed system, yesterday. I have not done anything to any part of the file system, save removing apparmor.
[02:17] <Ben65> should wipe all mysql stuff and re-do it properly
[02:18] <ikonia> Ziber: these vm's, what is the hypervisor
[02:18] <Ziber> ikonia: Xen.
[02:18] <Ziber> ikonia: Starting with /etc/init.d/mysql, syslog reports "init respawning too fast."
[02:18] <BlackDalek> what is .gtk directory stand for? Gnome... tool kit?
[02:19] <ikonia> Ziber: that sounds like another problem with your install
[02:19] <Ziber> ikonia: Rather "init: mysql respawning too fast, stopped".
[02:19] <ikonia> Ziber: I would look at the repositories you are using, that is not the behaviour of the ubuntu packages
[02:20] <Ziber> ikonia: How do I check that?

=== Guest54332 is now known as gannet
[02:21] <ikonia> Ziber: package version matches up from the current ubuntu repo package.
[02:21] <ikonia> Ziber: I'd watch the install process and see if anything is not downloaded properly
[02:21] <ikonia> also check the install logs / dpkg log see if there are any warnings
[02:22] <Ziber> ikonia: Alright, how do I safely remove everything and start over with the package?
[02:22] <ikonia> just purge the package
=== rob_ is now known as billzillski
[02:23] <Ziber> ikonia: Does that actually remove the files?
[02:24] <Ziber> apparently not.
[02:24] <Ziber> Can I rm -rf /var/lib/mysql?
[02:25] <Ziber> ikonia: I purged it, can I safely rm -rf /var/lib/mysql?
[02:25] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: why not, purge does remove files
[02:25] <dr_willis>  look and see whats left in there?
[02:26] <Ziber> It doesn't remove files. Or it didn't. And installing it back didn't put the files back.
[02:26] <lee8oi> Wow....KDE is more responsive than Unity
[02:26] <Ziber> Thoughts?
[02:27] <schmitt953> ubottu: no luck

[02:31] <ubuntu-tester1> schmitt953: and grub?
[02:31] <schmitt953> I'm using the vanilla 12.10 iso install cd
[02:31] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: the bootloader loads
[02:31] <Ziber> Is there a way to get the files I need back in /var/lib/mysql?
[02:32] <ubuntu-tester1> schmitt953: what options listed in grub
[02:32] <schmitt953> I select english and it dies

[02:32] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester-1: rebooting the guest
[02:33] <skinnymg1> hello everyone
[02:33] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: what files fom the package are missing, example?
[02:33] <schmitt953> Language options start
[02:33] <whoever> hi all, anyone using  or has used a trackball with ubuntu : I am looking at getting the kensington expert mouse, and would like  to know if I will have to make the left and right keys to get to work, or will I need to create some mouse config file to get the keys to function propperly
[02:33] <schmitt953> going to text mode
[02:33] <schmitt953> I type help and I get the options
[02:33] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester1: /var/lib/mysql/*. I rm -rf'd that directory after the purge, no files were put back there after the install.
[02:34] <dr_willis> whoever:  the other day i noticed the arch linux wiki poages had some neat guides for a lot of the obscure mice and other input devices.  i learned a few tweaks to use on ubuntu from it. ;)
[02:34] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: would acpi be a reason for it hanging
[02:35] <dr_willis> Ziber:  many packages/servers have a server package, then a config/data package with the support files
[02:35] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: and what should be there? list package contents, i don't have one
[02:35] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: dpkg -L |grep '/var/lib'
[02:35] <whoever> dr_willis: the wikki off the home page  or some wikki articule barried within ? thx, and got a link
[02:35] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: trying acpi=off
[02:36] <dr_willis> whoever:  i just use the arch linux wiki search, or googles search
[02:36] <cfhowlett> whoever, suggest you search kensington+trackball+ubuntu
[02:36] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: trying install text

[02:36] <whoever> dr_willis: thx, cfhowlett thx
[02:36] <ubuntu-tester1> schmitt953: sorry, don't know much about qemu
[02:36] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: no luck :(
[02:36] <schmitt953> alright
[02:37] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: know any reason that the installcd should fail to boot
[02:37] <Ziber> So, mysql-server data/config package?
[02:38] <ubuntu-tester1> schmidtm: oh, do you boot from cd image or vhd?
[02:39] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: I think it's an issue with audio and acpi
[02:40] <ubuntu-tester1> schmitt953: not likely, since text mode don't work either

[02:41] <Ziber> Oh, interesting. Purge mysql-server-5.5. Reinstall. "Unable to set password for root mysql user."
[02:42] <cfhowlett> pac1, hardware?
[02:42] <pac1> same hardware I installed every previous ubuntu.
[02:42] <cfhowlett> pac1, OK.  did you checksum your iso?
[02:42] <pac1> yes
[02:42] <pac1> the download anyway.
[02:43] <Guest38758> i don't think i can get natural scrolling
[02:43] <pac1> how to checksum the disk.
[02:43] <cfhowlett> pac1, and you're doing a clean install from USB?
[02:43] <pac1> clean install from dvd
[02:43] <Ziber> So, anyone wanna try helping me with mysql?
=== Guest38758 is now known as gormanator
[02:44] <cfhowlett> pac1, we had a case recently where the ram had silently failed that sounds somewhat similar.  Suggest you do a hardware diagnostic.  Memtest for instance.
[02:44] <zebaszp> Ziber, did you install mysql-server from a deb package?
[02:44] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: i realy didn't get what files are you searching for
[02:45] <Ziber> zebaszp: apt-get install mysql-server-5.5
[02:45] <gormanator> Anyone here have any multitouch gestures suggestions
[02:45] <zebaszp> Ziber: try running "sudo dpkg-reconfigure mysql-server-5.5"
[02:45] <ghs> I'm with problem with the Eclipse. See the log: http://pastebin.com/PJvSEwYg How to fix that ?
[02:45] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester1: there are supposed to be files in /var/lib/mysql with table information and such, for the tables in the mysql database.
[02:45] <gormanator> i don't mean to repeat myself so I apologize, I just thought it would be clearer with a username attatched to me
[02:46] <Ziber> zebaszp: "mysql-server-5.5 is broken or not fully installed."
[02:47] <pac1> Ziber do you have databases you are trying to preserve?
[02:47] <Ziber> pac1: Not on this server, not yet.
[02:47] <Ziber> I just want the damn thing to run.
[02:47] <mjuszcza1> Anyone know a good program for Ubuntu (12.04 Unity) that easily allows you to filter through photos?  I've got a ton I'd like to go through and delete the bad ones, etc.
[02:47] <zebaszp> Ziber: try "sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get install --reinstall mysql-server-5.5" (delete package cache and redownload it)
[02:48] <mjuszcza1> Some of them are blurry and others are duplicates, but there's like 2000+ and going through them manually will be annoying.
[02:48] <pac1> Ziber, what do you get when you use the mysql command?
=== kslater1 is now known as kslater
[02:48] <whoever> dr_willis: thx again
[02:48] <cfhowlett> mjuszcza1, shotwell is the default photo manager in ubuntustudio ...
[02:48] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: from the package you install server, not any databases. you create db yourself afterwards, and all related files are put where you specify. maybe last time it was /var/lob/mysql accidentally
[02:49] <GinTonicool> hi guys ,configure: error: cannot find sources (src/amule.cpp) in . or . DEBIAN SYSTEM,help me please
[02:49] <mjuszcza1> sweet, that's installed.  Thanks!
[02:49] <zebaszp> in case the package was downloaded incorrectly (which shouldn't happen, anyways)
[02:49] <Ziber> zebaszp: http://pastebin.com/MeeXHZhT
[02:49] <Ziber> pac1: It's not running.
[02:49] <ubuntu-tester1> mjuszcza1: darktable maybe
[02:49] <whoever> mjuszcza1: well what do you mean filter ? you can put the photos in to folders by year
[02:49] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester1: It was a corrupt user table, when downloaded/installed via apt.
[02:49] <bazhang> GinTonicool, debian?
[02:49] <whoever> there is really nothing to filter on in a photo
[02:49] <GinTonicool> yes,debian
[02:50] <bazhang> GinTonicool, #debian , not here
[02:50] <ghs> Someone that uses Eclipse, can help ?
[02:50] <zebaszp> Ziber: "sudo apt-get -f install" should fix it
[02:50] <bazhang> ghs, tried the eclipse channel yet?
[02:50] <GinTonicool> ubuntu maybe the same with debian
[02:50] <ghs> bazhang, Yes. But, no response.
[02:50] <bazhang> GinTonicool, wrong
[02:50] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: there's no tables in the package, do you understand? check it yourself with my cmd above
[02:51] <bazhang> GinTonicool, /join #debian
[02:51] <whoever> mjuszcza1: you can write a quick script to grab the data about the image , ie: date taken and place all with date == xxxx into a specific folder
[02:51] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: I copied host cpu features, didn't have support, I guess it's not as customizable as Gentoo :(
[02:51] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester1: it comes with the mysql database, which has a number of tables, for user access and things.
[02:52] <mjuszcza1> whoever: well that would help as a start.  Are dates stored with the photos themselves?  I have *years* of photos all in the root of $HOME/Pictures, completely unorganized.
[02:52] <Ziber> zebaszp: Didn't work. "subprocess installed post-installation script returned error exit status 1"
[02:52] <mjuszcza1> But the atime/mtime on them is definitely inaccurate as I've renamed some of them, etc.  Filtering by month/year would be awesome.
[02:52] <whoever> mjuszcza1: digikam
[02:53] <zebaszp> Ziber: well that's weird, try "sudo dpkg -r mysql-server-5.5"
[02:53] <mjuszcza1> whoever: is that a CLI tool?
[02:53] <escott> mjuszcza1, there is usually a date inside the photo. exif information
[02:53] <Ziber> zebaszp: Alright, that removed it. Now try reinstalling?
[02:54] <mjuszcza1> ah, I just RTFM :) Thanks!
[02:54] <zebaszp> Ziber: yup
[02:54] <pac1> ziber,  there's two pieces client and server.. Did you install both?
[02:54] <ubuntu-tester1> mjuszcza1: try Google Picasa first. it is freezed now, but last released version may suffice
[02:54] <Ziber> pac1: I have mysql-client installed. It's a server issue.
[02:55] <zebaszp> Ziber: hopefully it'll work, but ultimately google will have an answer :P
[02:55] <whoever> mjuszcza1: its got . gui
[02:55] <mjuszcza1> Thanks ubuntu-tester1 and whoever
[02:55] <ubuntu-tester1> mjuszcza1: picasa automatically group pictures by year, month etc. (from EXIF)
[02:55] <Ziber> zebaszp: It's not working. There's some underlying issue here. http://pastebin.com/4fYgafPs
[02:56] <schmitt953> Ziber: why are you using mysql?
[02:56] <schmitt953> Ziber: Mysql is depricated now
[02:56] <schmitt953> s/depricated/deprecated
[02:56] <Ziber> schmitt953: Oh, yes, let's question my entire reason for being while we're at it.
[02:56] <schmitt953> Ziber: you could always upgrade to postgres
[02:56] <Ziber> That's just simply not true. And I want to use it.
[02:56] <schmitt953> ok
[02:56] <schmitt953> Ziber: I'm curious why
[02:57] <cfhowlett> mjuszcza1, see this maybe  http://www.rileybrandt.com/2012/07/31/linux-photo-1/
[02:57] <Ziber> I hate with a passion when people, rather than trying to help me fix a problem, simply say "oh, just don't use it." That's not a solution.
[02:57] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: manuals have some steps after installing, did you follow?
[02:58] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester1: I've installed mysql hundreds of times, I know how to do it. I've never seen this issue.
[02:58] <cfhowlett> Ziber, suggest you also ask in the forums.  The answers you want may not be instantly available to you in the irc channel.
[02:58] <schmitt953> Ziber: xD

[02:59] <schmitt953> figured out the bug (3 hours of wireshark) and fixed it
[03:00] <zebaszp> Ziber: I've done a little searching, it seems someone had a similar issue here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1763604
[03:00] <zebaszp> Ziber: ultimately, the part we care about is this: "sudo dpkg -P --force depends mysql-server mysql-server-5.5 mysql-common mysql-server-core-5.5 php5-mysql mysql-client-5.5 mysql-client-core-5.5"
[03:01] <Ziber> zebaszp: What's that do?
[03:01] <ubuntu-tester1> Ziber: if so, you can do it once more in a clean environment (virtual for ex), maybe on other ubuntu release, nail down those missing files and tell us at the end
[03:01] <mjuszcza1> sweet, thanks!
[03:01] <cfhowlett> mjuszcza1, http://www.enfew.com/image-editors-photo-organizer-for-ubuntu-linux/
[03:02] <schmitt953> why can't apt-get have USE flags like portage :(
[03:02] <mjuszcza1> cfhowlett: I think I'm writing a shell script to read the exif data and move the files from there.  Looks like it's working :) Thanks for your suggestions!
[03:02] <pac1> schmitt953, where do you get mysql is deprecated?
[03:02] <cfhowlett> mjuszcza1, great.  have fun, be safe.
[03:02] <urlwolf> can unity use gnome shell extensions?
[03:02] <schmitt953> in response to zebaszp's solution to Ziber
[03:02] <urlwolf> concretely shellshape
[03:03] <zebaszp> Ziber: force-purges the packages and raises dependency errors
[03:03] <schmitt953> pac1: most people are switching to postgres9, ever since postgres9 came out (a long time ago) it now outperforms mysql and is more robust, in addition there are still many vulns in mysql
[03:03] <schmitt953> even php (IMO it is rather deprecated) is distancing itself from mysql
[03:04] <pac1> interesting... any articles on this subject?
[03:04] <schmitt953> pac1: look at postgresql 9 and its new features

[03:07] <expressofa> Hi everyone, I have a critical problem at an unfortunate time. I've posted my problem to AskUbuntu but I was wondering if there was a place I could pay someone to focus on my problem. I don't need a whole year's worth of support (as offered by Canonical), I hope. Do I have any options or should I just try to bug people here until my problem is solved?
[03:08] <whoever> expressofa: first what is your problem
[03:08] <cfhowlett> expressofa, "bug" people?  well, you could ASK people and MAYBE someone in the channel might have just the answer you want at the moment you ask.  You could even post on the forums...
[03:09] <ubuntu-tester1> schmitt953: that's because of lack of questions from i guess :)
[03:09]  * whoever nodes at cfhowlett

[03:09] <schmitt953> ubuntu-tester1: I may be biased towards dev channels :)
[03:10] <expressofa> Basically boot fails, not sure what I did to instigate this or why it's happening or most importantly how I can fix.
[03:10] <expressofa> I believe that as soon as X tries to do something it blacks out the screen and then decides to become totally unresponsive.
[03:10] <whoever> expressofa: boot into recovery and select recover, and you are good to go
[03:10] <ubuntu-tester1> expressofa: if your're looking for paid support/administration, odesk may be the place to go
[03:11] <expressofa> whoever, I don't recall "recover" being an option. But I have tried all the options.
[03:11] <expressofa> whoever: most of them run fsck and then sit there blinking an underscore until I hit ctrl+c, then I get into a shell
[03:13] <whoever>  expressofa here is one way https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
[03:13] <expressofa> whoever: it's been running fine since installing windows for like a few months....

[03:18] <expressofa> whoever, what did you want me to do from that page? I've been doing recovery mode all day
[03:19] <ubuntu-tester1> expressofa: i suggest you get to the shell, and read through logs. or post it somewhere and ask someone to analyse
[03:19] <whoever> expressofa: if you hit escape it should bring up a recovery terminal with option and you select the kernel you want to recover , it will go to work and you should be up and running in about 20min
[03:20] <escott> ronson, ?
[03:20] <ronson> I'm supposed to have two drives on this server but only see one, how can I see the other drive?
[03:20] <ubuntu-tester1> expressofa: *analyze
[03:20] <escott> ronson, cat /proc/partitions or "sudo parted -l"
[03:20] <whoever> expressofa: also if the data is this importand to you , why not have a backup of the data, or have a disk image
[03:20] <expressofa> ubuntu-tester1: I read through logs and tried to post photos of the relevant ones, but if there's something else I should look for, I can try
[03:21] <expressofa> whoever: I have backups but I need to be productive and being productive means not being on Windows
[03:21] <warrior_> i have network printer lbp 810. but i cant print.. how to soft that problem and how to get LBP 810 printer driver
[03:22] <expressofa> whoever: is there documentation for this magic escape recovery console thing somewhere?
[03:22] <ubuntu-tester1> is network working? if yes, try to get the logs in text
[03:22] <ronson> Is it dangerous to resize partitions that are raided?
[03:22] <whoever> expressofa: so then shouldn't a restore of the backup solve both problemms, youll be back at a known good point, with ubuntu and windows
[03:22] <escott> ronson, its a little bit harder, but so long as they are unmounted its fine
[03:22] <expressofa> whoever: it's just file backups, not good comprehensive ones.
[03:22] <expressofa> not disk images
[03:22] <expressofa> unfortunately
[03:23] <ubuntu-tester1> ronson: almost as much as not raided i think
[03:23] <whoever> expressofa: so you don't even get grub ?
[03:23] <expressofa> whoever: I get grub
[03:23] <ronson> I can't unmount a disk I'm using to ssh can I? :P
[03:23] <expressofa> I get all the way to here: http://i.imgur.com/f1Hxc.jpg
[03:23] <whoever> expressofa: so you get the ubuntu logo {
[03:23] <whoever> ?\
[03:23] <escott> ronson, no
[03:24] <ronson> Looks like I'm stuck with this partitioning
=== jacob_ is now known as Guest94483
[03:24] <BroUnicorn> Okay, I've got a big problem
[03:24] <whoever> expressofa: then when you get the ubuntu logo hit escape
[03:24] <expressofa> after grub?
[03:24] <BroUnicorn> I put in my ubuntu Dvd and everything opened great
[03:24] <BroUnicorn> I pressed install
[03:24] <expressofa> whoever: I think it might freeze before escape could do anything, I'm not sure. I can try if you think that's the right course of action.
[03:26] <BroUnicorn> Then it wanted to automatically partition the drive, so I let it. I have Mac and Windows already on here. It did some stuff for a while, then threw me a partitioning error. Now My Windows hard drive doesn't show up on my Mac desktop, or in disk utility on my mac. Also, it doesn't allow me into my windows. I can choose it from the boot menu but it won't load all the way. The windows load screen is up for a good few seconds before the screen turns blue
[03:26] <BroUnicorn> momentarily and then exits.
[03:27] <Sylphie> looks like ubuntu trashed your partition table
[03:27] <whoever> expressofa: if that is the case get a live linux disto and run the disc utilliity to check drive health, you may have bad secotores on the drive , and in that case your stuck, replace the drive (all docs I saw to low level formate to fix bad sectors only put a bandaid on the problem )
[03:27] <BroUnicorn> Sylphie: Yes. Yes it does. How do I go about being able to get back into my Windows?
[03:27] <BroUnicorn> I understand some files may be lost.
[03:28] <schmitt953> I'm blanking on the command to upgrade to 12.10 from whatever version is running, anyone know it off the top of their head
[03:28] <whoever> expressofa: does the harddrive make any kind of loud noises
[03:28] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, first let's assume your Mac/Windows parts are present.
[03:28] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, so the install did NOT complete, right?
[03:28] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, and you're install on a Mac, I take it?
[03:28] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, a real Mac, not ihackintosh?
[03:28] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ norton utilities (esp disk editor) might let you repair the partition table
[03:28] <whoever> expressofa: ie: "tricking"
[03:28] <BroUnicorn> No, it did not complete
[03:28] <BroUnicorn> Yes, I am on a real mac. Macbook pro c. mid 2010
[03:29] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, OK .. is this a mac or a windows machine?
[03:29] <BroUnicorn> Mac.
[03:29] <expressofa> whoever: it's an SSD so no noise whatsoever
[03:29] <BroUnicorn> Sylphie: Okay, Where do I find that?
[03:29] <expressofa> whoever: also, fsck says nothing is wrong
[03:29] <whoever>  BroUnicorn sudo atitude dist-upgrade
[03:30] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ unfortunately norton utilities is commercial software you'd need to purchase
[03:30] <BroUnicorn> Sylphie: Is it expensive?
[03:30] <BroUnicorn> whoever: What's that?
[03:30] <whoever> expressofa: when did you get this ssd
[03:30] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Is there anything I can do?
[03:30] <BlackDalek> If I remove all installed desktops (unity, gnome, etc.) with purge option then re-install unity desktop... would that clear any customized colour settings?
[03:30] <expressofa> whoever: recently, I got the computer less than 4 months ago
[03:31] <whoever> expressofa: also on linux the docs say to do cartin theings in bios or you'll get problems
[03:31] <whoever> expressofa: what brand is the ssd
[03:31] <Sylphie> http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/7071/norton-utilities
[03:31] <BroUnicorn> Sylphie: The problem is that I can't even get into the Windows…. I can begin to open it but it reaches the loading screen, loads for a few seconds, then is gone
[03:32] <BroUnicorn> Sylphie: Ahh. Scratch that
[03:32] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, I suspect you windows and mac partitions were not overwritten but your partition table was trashed.  You could try booting the ubuntu CD again to see if the other parts show up.  IF those partitions were truly overwritten, you could try to recover them with various tools,  but I'm no mac expert.
[03:32] <expressofa> whoever: OCZ Agility 4
[03:32] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ there might be other free disk utilities for your mac
[03:33] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Okay. The partitions were not overwritten, I'm almost sure you are correct. In which case, what do I need to do?
[03:33] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: The partitions were not overwritten.
[03:33] <BroUnicorn> I'm not sure why colloquy said that twice haha.
[03:34] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ does OsX have anything liek a command line "fdisk" util?
[03:34] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, this is where I bail; I can't give mac advice, but assuming the data is present, recovery should be "easy"?
[03:34] <expressofa> whoever: in a root shell from GRUB I can access all my files (at least, the ones I tested)
[03:34] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: I'm simply asking for ubuntu advice :D
[03:34] <escott> BroUnicorn, if the NTFS was resized its possible it was corrupted in the process. boot a windows rescue disk and see if you can run chkdsk on that disk
[03:35] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: How can I fix this from Ubuntu? I believe that I may have even caused the issue by accidentally resizing something.
[03:35] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, understood, but there's that whole "bootcamp" thing.  Anyway, the MacTel crew can probably advise on this.
[03:35] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, wait 1 and I'lll get the link.
[03:35] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Okay, thanks
[03:35] <Crazy_Spai_> Greetings!
[03:36] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, also, check the mactel ubuntu forums.  You're neither the first nor the last ... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages
[03:36] <whoever> expressofa: i read the reviews and some people write about wha your discribing... it sounds like you make just have a flawed drive
[03:37] <whoever> expressofa: is this the first time this has happend to you with this drive
[03:37] <dr_willis> hard drives seem to be the weakest link these days in hardware.
[03:37] <expressofa> whoever: is there a definitive way to see if it's a hardware thing?
[03:38] <expressofa> whoever: yes, it's been stellar up to now
[03:38] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: If I were to go back into my mac and add size back to what I accidentally removed it from, would it correct the issue?
[03:38] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Or would that do nothing.
[03:38] <BroUnicorn> Back into ubuntu*
[03:39] <whoever> expressofa: since your were talking about windows on ssd , here is a link http://www.overclock.net/t/700470/tutorials-real-world-windows-7-ssd-tweaks-and-optimization
[03:39] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ adding size back might zero the space you add. better to ask the macexperts first
[03:39] <expressofa> whoever: my windows installation is on a different HDD
[03:39] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, as I said, macs are beyond my experience.  When I hackintoshed my lappy, I configured OSX, then Win7 then Ubuntu, but that's not what you've got.  I'd suggest recovering the native OS first, OSX, then windows and finally ubuntu.
[03:40] <whoever> expressofa: well that is pretty much the test, unless you want to go bu another ssd to repeate the process , you have already done it
[03:40] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Surprisingly, OSX is perfectly fine
[03:40] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: It's only windows having the problem
[03:40] <whoever> expressofa: ah, i assumed it was dual boot, but never the less the link minght help you
[03:41] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, OK. try windows "recovery/repair" with the windows disk
[03:41] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Meaning the disk that I originally installed it with?
[03:41] <whoever> expressofa: .... and just to make you fell better.... that will $60
[03:41] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, preferrably yes.
[03:41] <expressofa> whoever: cool, thanks, I'll read it over. If it's NOT a hardware thing, could the fact that I'm missing an xorg conf file have anything to do with it? Or maybe the apt-get upgrade I ran?
[03:41] <whoever> expressofa: +-)
[03:41] <BroUnicorn> Alright
[03:42] <dr_willis> expressofa:  xorg.conf is sort of optional these days
[03:42] <expressofa> dr_willis: ah, ok. Do the error messages in my X log file mean anything to anyone?
[03:42] <expressofa> http://i.imgur.com/L7Hp7.jpeg and http://i.imgur.com/5S9bY.jpeg for reference
[03:43] <whoever> expressofa: with no xorg.conf you would get server not connect errors
[03:43] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Do I do this while on OSX or Ubuntu? Or where do I put the cd in and try this?
[03:43] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: I very much so appreciate the responses btw
[03:43] <whoever> expressofa: and what happend to your xorg.conf
[03:43] <joshua__> how do i get root access on xubuntu
[03:44] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ better not to touch ubuntu again until you fix the partition table. a second time might really ruin things permanently
[03:44] <Ben65> joshua__: use sudo before the command you're trying to run
[03:44] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, no worries.  as far as installing windows on a mac, All I know is "bootcamp".  Check the Apple pages for the precise sequence.
[03:44] <whoever> expressofa: apt-get upgrade will not revome your xorg.conf
[03:44] <cfhowlett> !root|joshua__,
[03:44] <ubottu> joshua__,: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[03:44] <joshua__> why doesnt su work
[03:44] <Ben65> !root | joshua__
[03:44] <ubottu> joshua__: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[03:44] <cfhowlett> joshua__, sudo su but you really shouldn't require that ...
[03:44] <dr_willis> joshua__:  you dont su to root in ubuntu.
[03:44] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett: Okay, Update. In disk utility The bootcamp partition still shows up.
[03:45] <BroUnicorn> cfhowlett:
[03:45] <whoever> expressofa: you should remembr how long from the time you installed ubuntu to the time it quit , and now reinstall ubuntu
[03:45] <dr_willis> joshua__:  use sudo..   and dont do sudo su either
[03:45] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, good times.
[03:45] <whoever> just to make sure its not you
[03:45] <Ben65> yeah i didn't think "sudo su" was good
[03:45] <BroUnicorn> Sylphie: The bootcamp partition is still showing up in the Disk Utility, however when pressing Repair Disk It says "Repairing volume failed: Invalid request"
[03:45] <whoever> and do you get any i/0 errors durring boot
[03:45] <dr_willis> you caN SU TO OTHER NON-ROOT USERS
[03:45] <dr_willis> oops ;)
[03:46] <joshua__> ?
[03:46] <joshua__> on linux mint i could dp it that way
[03:46] <joshua__> well thanks anyways
[03:46] <dr_willis> ubuntu is not mint...
[03:46] <BroUnicorn> whoever: Me?
[03:46] <whoever> BroUnicorn: no that for expressofa
[03:46] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ I know little about macs, except that they used to be too expensive for my budget. But I do no a little about windows partition tables
[03:46] <whoever> dr_willis: have you made the jump to ssds
[03:47] <BroUnicorn> Sylphie: Okay, so what should be my first steps in attempting to correct this? Or is my best bet still norton
[03:47] <dr_willis> whoever:  i have one..  bene lookingat getting more. but the sizes are still too small
[03:48] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ ask the mac experts, they might know a free disk utility for OS X that might work
[03:48] <BroUnicorn> Any mac users that can help me with a messed up partition table?
[03:48] <expressofa> whoever: where would I see IO errors? It says something about KVMs when booting that seemed strange.
[03:49] <whoever> dr_willis: i think some brands arn't that reliable and yes the size on all brands is to small
[03:49] <expressofa> whoever: would reinstalling nuke all my data and configuration? I spent freakin' forever getting things set up right and it'd take forever to redo it all
[03:49] <whoever> expressofa: durring the boot process,  i think you can hit "i" durring boot to get the output
[03:50] <dr_willis> whoever:  i just have a 128gb one for my ubuntu install i got for $100 ons sale a few months back.  luckly linux makes it trivial  to have /home and daa drives on other  drives
[03:50] <whoever> expressofa: is it all on the same partition
[03:50] <alexhairyman> /etc/fstab magic
[03:50] <expressofa> whoever: yes
[03:50] <whoever> dr_willis: where did you get it
[03:50] <dr_willis> whoever:  staples ;)
[03:51] <cfhowlett> BroUnicorn, http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=328
[03:51] <whoever> expressofa: well  do you have another hardrive
[03:51] <dr_willis> whoever:  saw 200gb in the $200 range the other day. but thats still too tiny.
[03:51] <whoever> dr_willis: damn  is it still on sale
[03:51] <whoever> dr_willis: what brand
[03:52] <dr_willis> whoever:  128gb goes for  about $100 on amazon i think
[03:52] <BroUnicorn> The hell is a Linux swap partition?
[03:52] <expressofa> whoever: I do, the one my Windows is on
[03:52] <czz> Hi. Is there a way to find the directory location of a program I just installed?
[03:52] <cfhowlett> !swap|BroUnicorn,
[03:52] <ubottu> BroUnicorn,: swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[03:52] <dr_willis> BroUnicorn:  where the swap data is kept
[03:53] <dr_willis> czz:  installed how?
[03:53] <Ben65> why am i getting tons of crash reports all of a sudden
=== KaiSforza is now known as Tem`
[03:53] <whoever> dr_willis: I do data minning, (i guess you could call it ) so i have about 4T of satas
[03:53] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ it's just like a windows swap file, except it gets it's own partition
[03:53] <czz> dr_willis, apt-get
[03:53] <Gyro54> Hi!
[03:53] <cfhowlett> czz, whereis foo
[03:53] <cfhowlett> Gyro54, greetings
[03:53] <dr_willis> whoever:  i got a stack of 3TB usb hds for the wifes  shows ;)  and backups of her shows...
=== luke is now known as RNK6
=== Tem` is now known as Tom-
[03:54] <dr_willis> czz:  the apt/package manager tools have a way to show what files it installed
[03:54] <dr_willis> czz:  what app? what are you trying to do with it?
[03:54] <Gyro54> How do I list all the computers on a local network to see if I have an ip conflict?
[03:54] <dr_willis> Gyro54:  you could use nmap to scan the network
=== Tom- is now known as KaiSforza
[03:55] <Ben65> Gyro54: you should have a dhcp server to avoid stuff like that
[03:55] <Gyro54> Thanks dr_willis will do that!
[03:55] <whoever> expressofa: well remove that hard drive and place it in your linux box , boot up , do an fdisk -l to get the drive , mount that drive someware and create a folder to hold all data in , and then copy the data you want to that folder, unmount it, power off remove that harddrive and reinstall ubuntu
[03:56] <whoever> then you hook the drive back up ai]nd transfer your files back over
[03:56] <Gyro54> Ben65:  I have a DHCP win 2003 server but there is an error and everyone blames the Ubuntu machines.
[03:56] <Sylphie> BroUnicorn \ if ubuntu overlaid a linux swap partition onto a part of what was your windows partition, then your windows is probably corrupted beyond repair
[03:56] <expressofa> whoever: it's the same computer, two HDDs
[03:57] <Ben65> Gyro54: I'd blame the windows dhcp server.... but anyway nmap is great, but if two machines have the same IP, it could be hard to determine
[03:57] <czz> dr_willis, I've already installed the app, just trying to file the folder of settings,files,etc
[03:57] <BroUnicorn> I mean I have win clone with a working back up of windows, I just don't want to immediately jump to that because I would lose some recent things I've done
[03:57] <whoever> dr_willis: ... does she watch them ,? i can't get mine to watch the ones she has on dvr
[03:57] <Ben65> czz: what did you install
[03:57] <Sylphie> Ben65 \ how many machines on your lan?
[03:57] <czz> Ben65, Suricata
[03:57] <Gyro54> Ben65: Installing now!

[04:07] <whoever> RNK6: you should not be playing games in wine, or a vm, make windows your host and ubunu your guest, , get more ram, still not enough power then you need a new box
[04:07] <Ankur_Agarwal> apt-get update dont show 3.8.

[04:15] <Ankur_Agarwal> but
[04:15] <whoever> expressofa: yes
[04:16] <cub> how do i make ubuntu look like windows 95?
[04:16] <Sylphie> cub \ ewwww
[04:16] <cub> ?
[04:16] <dax> use GTK2 apps and the Raleigh theme. I assume there's a Windows 95 window decorations theme out there somewhere
[04:16] <Shortstraw8> Where/how do I find my ssh/pub key? I don't remember creating one for this computer
[04:17] <giorgi> server irc.mibbit.net
[04:17] <Sylphie> cub \ anyways, kde looks sort of like win95, so you could do a kubuntu configuration
[04:17] <giorgi> oops
[04:17] <evilthought> what am I doing wrong here? http://pastebin.com/p7KnXzwJ
[04:17] <giorgi> lol
[04:17] <dax> KDE looks nothing like Windows 95.
[04:17] <Tam-> kde > gnome.
[04:17] <cub> ok
[04:17] <cub> if i cant get that then
[04:18] <cub> how do i make it look like amiga
[04:18] <Sylphie> kde looks more like win95 than any of the other WMs
[04:18] <whoever> expressofa: expressofa but you would be much better off doing it the way i described, backing up and reinstalling, because it will be much more work to do what your wanting to do
[04:18] <Ben65> evilthought: you want to put the device in there, not the device and mount point merged together
[04:18] <dr_willis> slystone:  not really... go get IceWM and its themes
[04:18] <expressofa> whoever: this laptop has a discrete and an integrated graphics card that it switches between based on AC status and stuff. Could it be that it shut down in one and then is trying to boot up with the other or something? Or maybe there's saved hibernation data that's corrupted?
[04:19] <deus-ex> can anyone help me with an x issue?  The latest batch of ubuntu updates have broken something and now x won't detect my screens
[04:19] <Sylphie> deus-ex \ is this nvidia?
[04:20] <whoever> expressofa: what ... i have never heard of a laptop with two graphics cards that changed witch one controlled graphics from what the current power state is
[04:20] <deus-ex> Sylphie: yes
[04:20] <evilthought> sudo tune2fs -m 0 /dev/sdb1/ still doesn't work nor does sudo tune2fs -m 0 /media/owner/WD_Drive .. same error
[04:20] <expressofa> whoever: okay, so maybe it doesn't do that. But I feel like that could cause confusion to X
[04:20] <Shortstraw8> Can anyone help me locate my  my ssh/rsa key that I do not remember making and now can't fin is there an terminal command?
[04:21] <whoever> expressofa: hibirnation does not start untill you atleast get to the logon screen
[04:21] <expressofa> whoever: I know it runs some programs with discrete using optirun
[04:21] <Sylphie> deus-ex \ were you using the open source driver or the proprietary driver?
[04:21] <deus-ex> proprietary I believe
[04:21] <expressofa> but also maybe Windows told it to use discrete and that messed things up? I dunno how GPU state is handled between shutodwns
[04:21] <Ben65> evilthought: don't have a slash at the end of sdb1
[04:21] <Ben65> evilthought: its not a directory
[04:21] <deus-ex> Sylphie \ proprietary I believe
[04:22] <Sylphie> deus-ex \ you might try the open source driver then, just for the short term
[04:22] <evilthought> ok thabks
[04:22] <deus-ex> how can I switch to that from the command line?
[04:22] <whoever> expressofa: that uould probably be wheatthre or not the the display will display on battery with x% of battery life left
[04:22] <deus-ex> Sylphie \ how can I switch to that from the command line?
[04:22] <escott> expressofa, it likely depends on hot or cold shutdown
[04:22] <whoever> expressofa: brb smk 30
[04:22] <vedic> How much memory a process is allowed to lock? I am using SPhinx search mlock call which actually calls mlock(2) . I am getting Warning for not able to lock memory. How to fix this?
[04:23] <Sylphie> I'm thinking. I don't use a nvidia, I just see a lot of people with the same exact trouble you'be got
[04:23] <expressofa> escott: any way I can give it a cleansing bath of Bash commands and clean up whatever mess might be hanging around?
[04:23] <Sylphie> deus-ex \ it seems the nvidia drivers aren't so good for a lot of people
[04:23] <Ben65> nvidia drivers are fine
[04:24] <dr_willis> compared to some of the disasters ive seen with other drivers. ;)
[04:24] <escott> expressofa, a full shutdown (vs a reboot) should get the firmware to boot in the default settings
[04:24] <Shortstraw8> Can anyone help me find my rsa/ssh key that I do not remember making? is there a command in terminal? I need it for git so I can start programming for school.
[04:24] <Sylphie> Ben75 \ nvidia drivers are like the number 1 video complaint
[04:25] <deus-ex> Sylphie \ I didn't switch drivers when I updated, and I don't think it switched because there were beta versions I wasn't using
[04:25] <escott> Shortstraw8, your rsa ssh key would be in ~/.ssh/id_rsa
[04:25] <Sylphie> Ati drivers being the number 2 video complaint
[04:25] <Ben65> Sylphie: its also the number one used driver
[04:26] <Ben65> deus-ex: so what happened?
[04:26] <jubei> hello guys. Everything was working fine but all of a sudden the nvidia driver decided to stop working
[04:27] <jubei> any ideas how to troubleshoot it?
[04:27] <Ben65> jubei: define "all of a sudden"
[04:27] <dr_willis> reinstall the nvidia driver perhaps
[04:27] <Shortstraw8> escott, tried that gave me no such file or directory
[04:27] <jubei> Ben65, went home, came back to the office next day booted up, resolution was weird
[04:27] <dr_willis> move/rename your xorg..conf and restart the xx serrver as another test
[04:27] <jubei> Ben65, tried to load nvidia-xconfig thingie and it told me the nvidia driver isn't running
[04:28] <Ben65> jubei: nvidia-settings?
[04:28] <Sylphie> Ben65 \ drivers arent suppose to suddenly stop working
[04:28] <jubei> Ben65, yes nvidia-settings
=== night is now known as Guest76694
[04:28] <Ben65> then yeah, i'd try reinstalling nvidia as dr_willis suggested
[04:28] <escott> Shortstraw8, then you dont have your key on that computer
[04:28] <jubei> so nvidia-settings tells to run nvidia-xconfig as root to fix it
=== Guest76694 is now known as night_______
[04:29] <jubei> I did that but nvidia-xconfig said it cannot find xorg.conf (as far as I remember ubuntu doesn't use that anymore, right?)
[04:29] <Ben65> right
[04:29] <dr_willis> i have an xorg.conf on my nvidia ssytems.
[04:29] <dr_willis> but its only needed for special settings
[04:29] <Ben65> well to be more accurate, ubuntu doesn't _need_ xorg.conf anymore
[04:29] <dr_willis> 12.10 auto configured my nvidia cards with nvidia drivers without an xorg.conf for the most part
[04:29] <jubei> any ideas on how to proceed?
[04:30] <dr_willis> nvidia-xconfig -a   should generate a xorg.conf for your system i belive
[04:30] <dr_willis> then restart the x server and see if it loads uo annd uses the nvidia drivers
[04:30] <Shortstraw8> escott, when I try what bitbucket has to set up git it tells me that I have one. So I have been looking through ubuntu help and get the same message entering what they say.
[04:31] <jubei> http://codepad.org/KhHwYvHg
[04:31] <escott> Shortstraw8, if you created an rsa key it would be in ~/.ssh/id_rsa unless you specified an alternate location (and why would you do that)
[04:32] <dr_willis> jubei:  looks to me like its not loading the nvidia drivers
[04:32] <escott> Shortstraw8, its possible you created a dsa key instead of rsa or an elliptic curve key of some kind
[04:32] <Ben65> jubei: could you pastebin "lsmod" and "dpkg -l | grep -i nvidia"
[04:32] <Shortstraw8> escott,  do i just switch rsa and dsa to find out?
[04:32] <escott> Shortstraw8, baring your putting the key in a strange location it would be in ~/.ssh
[04:33] <deus-ex> Sylphie \ I'm also getting an error that my Nvidia driver doesn't match the kernel version
=== root_____ is now known as cokn
[04:33] <deus-ex> and I can't download the correct version from apt-get
[04:33] <Ben65> deus-ex: did you install it from the website
[04:33] <rkhshm> my laptop which is running 12.04 lists VPN in network settings but my office desktop also running 12.04 does not list VPN at all..
[04:33] <rkhshm> is there any pkg i need to install to get setup VPN in the first place?
[04:34] <Shortstraw8> escott,  When I enter that I get (Is a directory)
[04:34] <jubei> Ben65, http://codepad.org/jLyZcWTb
[04:34] <deus-ex> Ben65: No, only apt-get.  I don't think I can use their website - my only browser access right now is through lynx
[04:34] <cokn> ok so i did minimal install i have no unity and gnome install i want to install mate desktop while adding repo og mate in source list getting gpg error no key found while updating?
[04:34] <Ben65> deus-ex: no its good, installing the drivers from the site could cause problems
[04:35] <deus-ex> ok
[04:35] <escott> Shortstraw8, yes it is a directory
[04:35] <deus-ex> i got the 304 driver to install
[04:35] <deus-ex> Ben65: got the 304 driver to install, removing the old one, not sure how to activate the new one from the commandline
[04:36] <cokn> ok so i did minimal install i have no unity and gnome install i want to install mate desktop while adding repo og mate in source list getting gpg error no key found while updating?
[04:36] <jubei> Ben65, In case you missed it: http://codepad.org/jLyZcWTb
[04:36] <Ben65> jubei: what does "uname -r" say
[04:36] <jubei> oh sorry^^
[04:37] <Ben65> no problem :)
[04:37] <jubei> 3.5.0-21-generic
[04:37] <dr_willis> !gpg
[04:37] <ubottu> gpg is the GNU Privacy Guard.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto and class #8 on https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ClassroomTranscripts
[04:37] <Shortstraw8> escott, so when I enter mkdir ~/.ssh  I'm not making a new ssh so would I already have one? Sorry I'm new to this.
[04:37] <dr_willis> hmm there a factoid on finding  gpg keys
[04:37] <Ben65> jubei: sudo apt-get install nvidia-common nvidia-experimental-310-dev nvidia-settings-experimental-310 linux-headers-generic
[04:38] <Shortstraw8> escott,  So would I use ssh-keygen -t rsa?
[04:38] <jubei> Ben65, so what happened I got a kernel upgrade and the driver stopped working?
[04:38] <escott> Shortstraw8, you said you wanted to find your ssh key. it would be in the folder ~/.ssh. Unless you did something really strange when you ran ssh-keygen thats where it would be
[04:38] <cokn> dr_willis: i have gpg key but when i am adding it it says connection refused no pgp data found
[04:38] <Ben65> jubei: i'm not sure, but you're missing a couple packages that should have come with the driver
[04:38] <escott> Shortstraw8, ssh-keygen will prompt you through the process of generating a new key
[04:38] <jubei> Ben65, I see. Thanks so much for the help! Appreciated!
[04:39] <dr_willis> cokn:  could be their key server is down.   you may want to check the mate support forums/channels
[04:39] <Ben65> jubei: it might not be done after that command though
[04:39] <jubei> Ben65, let me restart the xserver brb
[04:39] <cokn> dr_willis:  ok i will try
[04:40] <jubei> Ben65, it worked like a charm thank you!!
[04:40] <Ben65> jubei: awesome
[04:40] <Shortstraw8> escott, Yeah I haved looked through ALL my folders and can't find it.
[04:41] <deus-ex> Ben65: by doing a sudo apt-get purge nvidia* I got a basic gui up and running
[04:42] <escott> Shortstraw8, you could just generate a new one. ssh keys are not as important as gpg identity keys. in fact its normal to have a different one for each machine
[04:42] <Ben65> deus-ex: but you still want nvidia?
=== enchilado is now known as FunNick
[04:43] <Shortstraw8> escott, OK so stupid question I don't need to erase the exsisting one?
[04:44] <escott> Shortstraw8, you shouldn't leave a key on bitbucket that no longer identifies you
[04:44] <Shortstraw8> escott, Ok thank you thank you!!
[04:45] <deus-ex> well yeah, the resolution is at like 640x480
[04:45] <escott> Shortstraw8, honestly think of it like a key. keep it safe... if it gets stolen or a copy gets lost. think about changing the locks
[04:45] <deus-ex> Ben65: yeah, the resolution is at like 640x480 i'd like to use my graphics card
=== FunNick is now known as enchilado
[04:45] <Shortstraw8> escott, I have been looking for that for an hour
[04:45] <escott> Shortstraw8, ie generate a new key to replace it, upload the new public key, and disable the old public key
[04:45] <escott> Shortstraw8, it doesn't cost you anything to create a new one
[04:45] <Sylphie> deus-ex \ you might try the neuvou driver if the nvidia driver is a failure
[04:46] <escott> Shortstraw8, i don't know why you would bother looking for more than a minute honestly
[04:46] <Ben65> deus-ex: which card do you have
[04:46] <Shortstraw8> escott, I'm new to this and did'nt want to mess anything up.
[04:47] <Shortstraw8> escott, I appreciate your help.
[04:48] <deus-ex> Ben65: Not sure, it's been a while since I bought the computer.  How do I find out?
[04:53] <BroUnicorn> Alright so
[04:54] <BroUnicorn> Few more questions. I figured out how I can save my files (for anyone following my issues today)
[04:55] <BroUnicorn> I can access the files on my trashed partition table windows partition from ubuntu. However, I don't have full access to Macintosh HD or Windows, so how can I edit my administrative privileges to where I can move files between them easily from ubuntu?
[04:56] <spizzo> I resized my ubuntu partition and installed fedora, but did not allow fedora to install its bootloader; how do I add fedora as an option to ubuntu's bootloader?
[04:56] <BroUnicorn> When I say I don't have full access, I mean that it won't let me move my files to my Mac hard drive. Says I don't have permission.
[04:56] <rkhshm> i'm not able to see the VPN tab at all in network settings on 12.04
[04:56] <rkhshm> any ideas of what is going on here?
[04:56] <rkhshm> my laptop has the same OS version but there I'm seeing the VPN tab but not on my desktop
[04:57] <raz__> hello

[05:01] <BroUnicorn> dr_willis: Hello, would you mind answering merely a few more questions for me?
[05:01] <dr_willis> BroUnicorn:  i can try.
[05:02] <escott> BroUnicorn, are you sure it was permissions and not that the hfs+ was read only
=== Guest59056 is now known as dennyabrain
[05:02] <BroUnicorn> escott: It very well could have been that..
[05:02] <dennyabrain> .
[05:02] <escott> BroUnicorn, i believe that the current hfs tools disable writing to HFS+ when the journal is enable
[05:03] <escott> d
[05:03] <BroUnicorn> escott: Okay, that makes sense. What's the journal, and can I disable it in order to save some files?
[05:03] <escott> BroUnicorn, http://superuser.com/questions/84446/how-to-mount-a-hfs-partition-in-ubuntu-as-read-write
[05:05] <rkhshm> any solutions guys?
[05:06] <rkhshm> 12.04 has by far been the worst releases.. can't believe it
[05:06] <BroUnicorn> Okay, I really appreciate it. Although this leads to another question or two. When I click "try ubuntu" terminal doesn't seem to be on the os. How do I get it on there?
[05:06] <dr_willis> BroUnicorn:  alt-ctrl-t or use the dash search feature to sesrch for 'terminal'

[05:23] <escott> joe9, for multi-line things you want to run in cron you should have cron run a shell script with your desired shell

[05:27] <BroUnicorn> I'm attempting to just delete the windows partition so I can restore it to a backup, but it won't even let me do that.
[05:27] <escott> joe9, yeah nevermind
[05:27] <Nex> Quick question about the dock. I upgraded from 10. something to 12.04 and now it's always on top of my windows. That's valuable screen space I would like back. And no, autohide is not what I'm looking for. Thanks.
=== Err404NotFound is now known as Error404NotFound
[05:27] <escott> joe9, you might want to investigate why you are having to restart your tunnel. that would seem to be the real problem
[05:27] <escott> joe9, you can ask ssh to send keep alives, or keep the channel open for a longer period of time
[05:28] <joe9> escott: yes, I have the keepalives and all that sorted.
[05:28] <joe9> I have ssh and autossh in the boot process too.
[05:28] <joe9> escott: I was just trying to restart from cron as a backup measure.
[05:29] <joe9> escott: at this point, I am just testing it out.
[05:30] <worm> I have just installed a new Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86_64 with btrfs for /. However when I boot, I see something like "ERROR: sparse file not allowed". I pressed somekey to continue and found no problem. What happened?
[05:31] <escott> worm, thats going to be awful. would strongly recommend you switch back to ext4
[05:32] <Inous> hell all
[05:32] <Inous> hello*
[05:32] <Nex> Quick question about the dock. I upgraded from 10. something to 12.04 and now it's always on top of my windows. That's valuable screen space I would like back. And no, autohide is not what I'm looking for. Thanks.
[05:32] <Inous> I'm in need of some help
[05:33] <Inous> I'm using ubuntu 12.04
[05:33] <dr_willis> what do you want instead of aut ohideing?
[05:34] <dr_willis> ! ask
[05:34] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[05:34] <worm> But I've heard that someone recommend me to use btrfs for the new features, and the system is already installed. Will that cause any problems or how can I ignore such notification?
[05:34] <dr_willis> worm:  btrfs is experimental
[05:34] <Nex> I want it to function how it previously did. If I go to the desktop it's there, but if I'm in a window I want it to stay behind what I'm doing.
[05:35] <worm> dr_willis: I think that he is looking for the dock in 11.04 to 11.10... That dock is much better.
[05:35] <dr_willis> Nex: the intelihude feature is. gone. autohide or always show are the options
[05:36] <worm> dr_willis: I know that it is experimental, but I think that to try something experimental is important.
[05:36] <Nex> Which is bogus.
[05:36] <dr_willis> ! btrfs
[05:36] <ubottu> Btrfs is a new filesystem available for Ubuntu. It is currently marked as experimental, and should not be used for important data. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/btrfs
[05:36] <Nex> I'm aware that it's gone, but is there any way to correct that horrible mistake in judgment?
[05:37] <Nex> Whoever decided it should behave as it currently does needs slapped around a good bit.
[05:37] <dr_willis> look for unofficial ppas or replacements perhaps
[05:37] <dr_willis> the code had major bugs I recall
[05:37] <dr_willis> it was discussed in blogs ages ago
[05:38] <Nex> I'm incredibly new to ubuntu. I'm not sure how to do, or understand, much of anything
[05:38] <dr_willis> best fix is to use autohide then
[05:38] <polar> hi
[05:39] <polar> anybody here?
[05:39] <worm> !help|polar
[05:39] <ubottu> polar: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[05:39] <dr_willis> I always use always show
[05:39] <Nex> Bleh, that's craptastic and a half. Autohide is a nuisance.
[05:39] <dr_willis> ! brainstorm
[05:39] <ubottu> Post your ideas for Ubuntu at http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com and vote for the ones you like!
[05:39] <polar> after installing ubuntu, can i upgrade it to ubuntu server later from within ubuntu?
[05:40] <dr_willis> polar: theres no upgrade to do.
[05:40] <Nex> If I wasn't using a laptop I would mind a lot less but it's a horrible waste of screen space.
[05:40] <dr_willis> polar: install the services you need
[05:40] <dr_willis> you can change the icon sizes nex
[05:41] <mesquka> !patience
[05:41] <ubottu> Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[05:41] <Nex> yeah, but that isn't really the issue you know? It seems like my only real options are to make it slightly less bothersome, and try to ignore it
[05:42] <dr_willis> the ussue is the big bugs in intelihide...
[05:43] <polar> i have win7 dell i3 laptop with 4G RAM. i am running a application which takes up 100% of the processor. And if i continue to run, it overheats. That application has ubuntu version too...Will using it in ubuntu help with using less processor?
[05:43] <dr_willis> so pick the options mentioned that you want.
[05:43] <dr_willis> polar: what app?
[05:43] <polar> that application's name is GNS3 - it is a networking simulator
[05:43] <Nex> I find it hard to believe there isn't a million and one code monkeys out there that can make a dock that works well and doesn't break all the time...
[05:44] <dr_willis> odd it can overheat a cpu.
[05:44] <dr_willis> ! dick
[05:44] <dr_willis> ! dock
[05:44] <ubottu> Ubuntu includes several dock-like navigation bars. Some options are: avant-window-navigator, cairo-dock, docky (formerly part of gnome-do), stalonetray, simdock, kdocker, kooldock.
[05:44] <dr_willis> :)
[05:44] <renzyyy> lol...
[05:44] <polar> if i use more than 8 router simulators at a time in that app, yes, my laptop overheats
[05:46] <polar> so my question is, will i see less processor usage when i use the app in ubuntu?
[05:47] <dr_willis> i see gns3 mentioned here every so often. never used it.. if no one else in here knows. you may want to check on askubuntu.com and the forums about it.
[05:49] <polar> GNS3 is used by networking professional to simulate networks, these simulators works exactly like CISCO routers and switches used in the industry. so it is very helpful to build and study and test complex networks, As for me , I am a student studying for CCIE exam.
[05:49] <dr_willis> my degree is in Agricultural Engineering. ;)
[05:50] <polar> wow
[05:50] <dr_willis> I cant even comprehend what a network simulator would actually simulate.. ;P
[05:50] <dr_willis> or why it would run so fast it would need to overload the cpus so much
[05:51] <polar> For example, if you have like a highlllyyyyyy capable server which is extreeeemely powerful, GNS3 is capable of simulating your entire ISP including you and me
[05:51] <dr_willis> But  as i said.. askubuntu.com or the forums may have some info on its  useabilty
[05:52] <polar> ok
[05:53] <dr_willis> unless anyone else in here knows.. but if they did , they would have chimmed in by now i imagine

[06:14] <dr_willis> you can edit things in vi or nano or other editors and  then edit them later in gedit...
[06:15] <dr_willis> Inous:  ssh  and the x forwarding feature. or vnc.
[06:15] <giNeeRing> How can I reload the kernel that came with my install?
[06:15] <dr_willis> Inous:  or  freenx

[06:15] <Not_a_cop> hm. Thanks guys @madprops &  dr_willis
[06:15] <dr_willis> giNeeRing:  modified what exactly?

[06:21] <dr_willis> !bt
[06:21] <giNeeRing> I know, but it is based off of ubuntu
[06:22] <giNeeRing> and no help in the channel
[06:22] <dr_willis> dosent matter... it has its own channels on a differnt server
[06:22] <dr_willis> !backtrack
[06:22] <ubottu> There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mint), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)

[06:24] <Guest31016> hello, how could i change grub to lilo?

[06:24] <dr_willis> im not even sure its doable
[06:25] <magn3ts> Any reason why out of the blue FB and HN would stop resolving on my network... and then be fixed after disabling IPv6 on eth0?
[06:26] <Theodore> hello
[06:26] <Theodore> how do i paste AACS files to ./config when ./config file permissions are grayed out
[06:26] <Guest31016> dr_willis , when installing ubuntu 12.04 using the erase and install option my computer gets freeze at boot couldnt even enter the bios
[06:27] <dr_willis> Theodore:  set the owner and/or permissions of the file to be owned by your current user, would be one way
[06:27] <dr_willis> Theodore:  or edit the file as the root user.
[06:28] <dr_willis> Guest31016:  i dont see how the OS can keep the pc from entering the bios. Unless you got some weird hardware
[06:29] <Guest31016> dr_willis , when installing ubuntu 12.04 using the erase and install option my computer gets freeze at boot couldnt even enter the bios. i had the same problem with 11.04 but solved it using the everything else install option (strange??) unfortunately im not being able to install 12.04 that way
[06:29] <dr_willis> id partion it by hand using gparted how you wanted then use  the 'somthing else' option to set the proper mount points
[06:30] <dr_willis> you may wan tto try 12.10 also
[06:30] <Guest31016>  unfortunately im not being able to install 12.04 that way
[06:30] <Theodore> dr_willis, wouldn't it be easier to just move them to that ./config dir in terminal?
[06:30] <dr_willis> and what does it do when you try..
[06:30] <r4y> I want to know your thoughts about http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/
[06:31] <dr_willis> Theodore:  i not sure whata you mean. but ifyou want your user to be able to edit files.. then the permissions need to be set to allow it.
[06:31] <Stephini> since when can linux be installed INSIDE of windows?
[06:31] <Guest31016> dr_willis , it crashes at system locales (something like that)
[06:31] <dr_willis> Stephini:  for ages... last 4+ releases at least
[06:32] <dr_willis> Guest31016:  id cerify the cd/download and make sure it was a good burn. perhaps use a usb/flash drive instead.
[06:32] <dr_willis> verify
[06:32] <Stephini> my last linux was fedora moonshine...so i'm a bit out of the loop...but that is bloody awesome! especially since it turns out i have 4 primary partitions so cant make a new one...
[06:32] <dr_willis> !md5
[06:32] <ubottu> To verify your Ubuntu ISO image (or other files for which an MD5 checksum is provided), see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM or http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
[06:32] <Guest31016> dr_willis , it crashes at system locales (something like that) to be honest i could do it once (this computer is old and unstable)
[06:32] <dr_willis> Stephini:  thats a wubi install.. and tends to be problematic.. i would suggest not using wubi
[06:33] <Stephini> gahh...then what should i do?
[06:33] <Guest31016> dr_willis , i forget to mention that im doing this on an usb pen drive
[06:34] <dr_willis> Stephini:  you can do a full install to an external usb if you wanted..
[06:34] <Stephini> my laptop doesn't have the usb power for an HDD nore do i have one spare.
[06:34] <dr_willis> or redo your partitions
[06:34] <madprops> what's the name of the notification area that includes the battery, volume icons etc?
[06:34] <uman> assuming a bug was fixed in Debian on November 17th, 2012, when can I expect to see it fixed in Ubuntu?
[06:34] <uman> A bug in a package, that is
[06:35] <dr_willis> uman:  depends on the bug and how critical it was
[06:35] <uman> dr_willis: very non-critical
[06:35] <uman> dr_willis: just some pkg-config files were missing from a package
[06:35] <dr_willis> then it may never get  updated untill the next relesase
[06:35] <uman> dr_willis: that was the thrust of my question
[06:35] <uman> dr_willis: which Ubuntu release will include it
[06:35] <uman> 13.04 ?
[06:35] <dr_willis> perhaps the NEXT release. ;)
[06:35] <Guest31016> dr_willis , what could be different between "erase and install" and everything else options that could make this happen?
[06:36] <uman> dr_willis: ok :)

[06:37] <BroUnicorn> I can't delete the windows partition.
[06:37] <BroUnicorn> It won't let me restore my Mac OSx partition to one single partition
[06:38] <Stephini> not sure how i would do that...acer has a partition that i'm not sure is wise to remove...(hate mesing with partiotions...) windows 8 has two...then all the files i want to go through still is on the other...
[06:39] <dr_willis> Stephini:  if the HD is  GPT partioned - you can have more then 4 primary partitions
[06:39] <uman> how can I use apt-get (or aptitude, or a related tool) to show the contents of an installed package?
[06:39] <dr_willis> i dont think GPT partioned is the right word... ;P
[06:39] <Stephini> GPT partiotioned? not sure what that is...but gparted said i cant have more than the 4...
[06:39] <BroUnicorn> I'm not sure what I can do if I can't even delete the bootcamp partition
[06:39] <dr_willis> guess its not a Gpt disk then.
[06:39] <BroUnicorn> trying to install ubuntu really screwed my partition table
[06:40] <dr_willis> uman:  one of the apt  cli tools can do it.. but i dont recall the one or the syntax.

[07:09] <r4y> I just wanted to come here and say I am sorry about being upset the other day on this channel. My apologizes to anyone that was here then when I was expressing how I don't like the new Ubuntu because of things missing I wanted but I was being an idiot. There are things that can be installed
[07:09] <r4y> I haven't tried
[07:10] <r4y> I tried Ubuntu but failed in knowing how to make it my own. I am using Ubuntu 10.04 right now
[07:10] <r4y> I meant I tried Ubunt 12 and failed at making it mt own
[07:10] <r4y> I have some bookmarks for some directions to go
[07:12] <linwish_> dont be shy, just try
[07:12] <r4y> Also I have been upset because my computer's motherboard or bios is messed up and I am currently using our other computer which is an emachines computer. Yes I know, ha ha
[07:13] <linwish_> good, practice makes perfect
[07:13] <Stephini> those still exist?
[07:14] <r4y> We, I guess I will be using a virtual program of some type. What should I use for anything other then Ubuntu that is Linux?, I will also be testing Ubuntu as well, as I found this, wait a sec

[07:16] <joe9> i installed a dual boot windows and ubuntu. grub always boots into windows. I cannot figure out why, /etc/default/grub: GRUB_DEFALT=saved, GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=true, and then ran update-grub.

[07:18] <joe9> do I have to do a grub install or something like that after the above?
[07:20] <CCKA> hey all, question I got a question. After trying to uptade the system the update process failed and /boot is full
[07:20] <CCKA> it filled up with newer kernels and now if I reboot the machine it will not start (so I did not reboot)
[07:21] <CCKA> grub was trying to update from 1 to v2
[07:21] <CCKA> any heal would be great

[07:56] <BroUnicorn> To anyone following my issues today... I deleted the partition. :|
[07:56] <khaos> nabblet, If I set it to None so I can boot?
[07:56] <nabblet> khaos: if the other systems (Windows Vista/7/8, GNU/Linux...) of your computer are installed in EFI mode, then you must install Ubuntu in EFI mode too.
[07:57] <helmut_> hi
[07:57] <histo> BroUnicorn: I can look back but what problem are you having now?
[07:57] <khaos> nabblet, i have read this article and tried to follow , but ubuntu splash screen in live mode doestn appears, Only black screen. I disabled Quick boot, but the results are the same :(
[07:57] <histo> !uefi | khaos
[07:57] <ubottu> khaos: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[07:58] <khaos> histo, i know that. I just can't boot on my live dvd in order to install ubuntu side by side with win8
[07:58] <nabblet> khaos: sorry, i can not help you further - i did it only once and it worked following the link i sent you
[07:59] <histo> khaos: Have you read steps 1 & 2
[07:59] <khaos> nabblet thanks, one question only. I can't find how to disable the UEFI CD boot from bios
[08:00] <android> have you try boot from usb
[08:00] <histo> khaos: make sure you are using 64bit and ubuntu 12.10
[08:00] <android> ubuntu 12.10 usb
[08:00] <khaos> histo in step #2 I get black screen after the Try Ubuntu option
[08:00] <android> flash drive
[08:00] <BroUnicorn> histo: None other than the empty hole in my heart from the information I lost. ;(
[08:00] <histo> BroUnicorn: did you already write to the drive or are you trying to recover the data?
[08:01] <khaos> Ok but in my Bios I have only two options: Boot UEFI CD AND Boot UEFI HD (Windows) and NONE
[08:01] <khaos> IF I put Windows it will boot windows
[08:01] <khaos> If I put UEFI CD it boots ubuntu and after blackscreen. That's why I need help
[08:02] <histo> khaos: which ubuntu cd are you using?
[08:03] <BroUnicorn> histo: I already completely erased the partition....
[08:03] <android> try burn the iso to cd r dvd again
[08:03] <histo> BroUnicorn: so the data is still there
[08:03] <android> sometime burning error
[08:03] <BroUnicorn> histo: Haha no...
[08:03] <BroUnicorn> histo: How could it be? I erased the partition using disk utility.
[08:04] <histo> BroUnicorn: Okay well I work in computer forensics and data recovery but believe what you want.
[08:04] <histo> BroUnicorn: because deleting a partition does not delete any data.
[08:04] <nabblet> BroUnicorn histo is right
[08:04] <histo> BroUnicorn: it just erases a few bits on the master partitioin table of the disk
[08:04] <histo> BroUnicorn: bytes I should say not bits
[08:05] <histo> BroUnicorn: Even formatting doesn't erase the data. Unless you do a low level format. Or overwrite all he data with 0's
[08:05] <histo> BroUnicorn: So again I ask you what type of file system was it?
[08:05] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay.. That's awesome. I'm a CS student so I understand what you're saying. How can I recover some? All of this originated from have partition table errors from trying to install ubuntu.
[08:06] <histo> BroUnicorn: Well did you finally install ubuntu or did you just stop eventually?
[08:06] <BroUnicorn> histo: NFTS I believe. It was a Windows 7 bootcamp.
[08:06] <android> you can say 8bits or byte the same
[08:06] <BroUnicorn> I just installed ubuntu...
[08:07] <histo> android: I know but there are several bytes int he master partition table that are changed.
[08:07] <BroUnicorn> After deleting the non-working partition.
[08:07] <histo> BroUnicorn: on the drive you want to recover files off of?
[08:07] <BroUnicorn> Yeah it's on the drive. I had given up on recovering files.
[08:07] <histo> BroUnicorn: do you have a removable drive laying around?
[08:07] <BroUnicorn> Damn if you had been here just slightly earlier.
[08:07] <histo> BroUnicorn: there is still time.
[08:08] <histo> BroUnicorn: you'd be suprised what is still on yoru disk.
[08:08] <BroUnicorn> I have DVDs sadly
[08:08] <histo> BroUnicorn: do you have more than one drive in the machine?
[08:08] <BroUnicorn> No. It's a MacBook pro.
[08:09] <BroUnicorn> Now dual-booted with Osx lion and ubuntu
[08:09] <histo> BroUnicorn: What type of files are you most concerned about?
[08:09] <BroUnicorn> I do have a backup version of my windows but its pretty old.
[08:09] <TimeRider_UK> BroUnicorn : did you read the link I posted yesterday, cos that mentions about corruption and how to avoid
[08:09] <BroUnicorn> There are actually only a few files I want. Im into making music using this program called fl studio.
[08:10] <nabblet> BroUnicorn: not sure if histo mentioned it but i think first thing is to make sure that noting gets written to the hdd now
[08:10] <histo> BroUnicorn: so like wavs and mp3's etc..
[08:10] <histo> nabblet: yeah
[08:10] <BroUnicorn> I had a few new tracks id love to save if at all possible.
[08:10] <histo> BroUnicorn: well I'd boot to the install cd immediately.  Then sudo apt-get install testdisk   that will give you accesss to a wonderfull program called photorec.
[08:10] <BroUnicorn> histo: Actually its a specific filetype for the program. Its a .flp
[08:11] <BroUnicorn> I have the install cd.
[08:11] <histo> BroUnicorn: you can use photorec to search your hdd int he unallocated space for files of a specific type.  I'll look if it has support for flp if not you can make your own header filter with a program like scapel and carve those files.
[08:11] <android> FL = Fruity Loops
[08:11] <TimeRider_UK> BroUnicorn http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/13706/recover-deleted-files-on-an-ntfs-hard-drive-from-a-ubuntu-live-cd/
[08:12] <BroUnicorn> I have testdisk on my osx.
[08:12] <histo> BroUnicorn: you need to boot the live cd so you stop using the drive.
[08:13] <histo> BroUnicorn: otherwise you are limiting the chance that you will recover the flp files.
[08:13] <BroUnicorn> Okay. Im using irc from my phone.
[08:13] <histo> BroUnicorn: but photorec does recover flp files
[08:13] <kunji> BroUnicorn: I came into this conversation a bit late.  So, you wiped the partition table and installed an OS?  So there is a chance your files were overwritten and gone for good.  Or did you only lose the partition table?  Because there's a way you can try to recover that.
[08:13] <histo> BroUnicorn: okay boot the ubuntu cd on that box now
[08:13] <histo> kunji: no he installed
[08:13] <android> AndroIRC
[08:14] <histo> BroUnicorn: just ignore them due to the way windows is structured you may have not overwritten any data. There are swap files etc... that take up a large first portion of the disk.
[08:14] <BroUnicorn> Dude where the hell were you guys earlier hahaha. Earlier no one had a clue what I was talking about so I gave up lol.
[08:14] <histo> BroUnicorn: atleast any user data in windows 7
[08:14] <BroUnicorn> Booting from cd now
[08:14] <histo> BroUnicorn: well not often that a data recovery person is around.
[08:14] <histo> BroUnicorn: I happen to be an expert in computer forensics.
[08:14] <BroUnicorn> histo: You're incredible. I think I love you.
[08:15] <nabblet> BroUnicorn: to be honest - the big flaw of irc is that this conversation is not documented as well - imagine tomorrow an other dude will come with a similar problem :P
[08:15] <dr_willis> nabblet:  the channel is logged
[08:15] <BroUnicorn> Do I need to get testdisk on my ubuntu boot disk?
[08:15] <histo> nabblet: I'm pretty sure this channel is logged but most people don't search it.
[08:15] <histo> dr_willis: hey what's up long time no see
[08:16] <dr_willis> histo:  back on 3rd shift now. ;)
[08:16] <nabblet> dr_willis: histo that's the point - it will not be searched
[08:16] <BroUnicorn> histo: Man I appreciate this a lot. And yeah I definitely see that happening.
[08:16] <histo> dr_willis: yessir
[08:16] <kunji> histo: T.T, well, this situation is ugly.  Also aren't those swaps < 500 megs, I wouldn't call  it a large portion, that said, an Ubuntu install is < 5 gigs, so there's a good chance of recovering stuff.  Hmm, expert in computer forensics, if I have any trouble I'm PMing you :P
[08:16] <dr_willis> i just got back on 3rds.. and now they are discussing chanvgeing the shift hours here again next month. ;()
[08:17] <histo> kunji: most likely he will get lucky recovering just user files. You are forgetting the windows 7 data also at the front of the drive.
[08:18] <nabblet> at chance - does anyone know the avaerage respones time in the ubunut forum?
[08:18] <histo> dr_willis: yeah i'm on 12hr shifts.
[08:18] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay, ubuntu is nearly booted. When it is I need to download testdisk first, correct?
[08:18] <histo> nabblet: it's pretty quick while you wait I would search askubuntu.com
[08:18] <kunji> histo: Hmm, that's true, I forget because my partitions tend to be less standard than the typical install.
[08:18] <histo> BroUnicorn: yeah photorec is included in the testdisk package. so once it's booted select try ubuntu.  Then get internet connected. open a terminal and sudo apt-get install testdisk
[08:19] <histo> kunji: I learned this because you wouldn't believe the attempts people fail at trying to delete child pornogrpahy
[08:19] <nabblet> histo: where does the packages get installed to?
[08:19] <histo> nabblet: which packages?
[08:19] <histo> nabblet: when you are booting off the live cd?
[08:19] <nabblet> histo: of you apt-get on a livecd
[08:20] <histo> nabblet: ram drive
[08:20] <kunji> histo: lol, oh man, I guess no one told them about degaussing :P
[08:20] <histo> kunji: you don't catch the smart ones
[08:20] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay. Connecting to internet and trying to find terminal. I dont know if terminal is on here as I cant find it.
[08:21] <BroUnicorn> histo: And also, thats messed up haha
[08:21] <histo> BroUnicorn: press the apple key should bring up the dash then start typing terminal
[08:21]  * dr_willis recalls telling someone this earlier today..
[08:21] <dr_willis> ;)
[08:21] <nabblet> histo: but it has limited space - what will happen if you go for something with plenty dependencies?
[08:21] <dr_willis> or alt-ctrl-t
[08:21] <histo> dr_willis: he's on a mac
[08:21] <kunji> nabblet: I agree about IRC not being easily searchable, I've searched it, but you find so many things that aren't relevant or were never resolved, it gets old pretty fast.  It's too bad we don't have the time to curate the logs for the useful bits.
[08:21] <dr_willis> hes on a ubuntu live cd i thought,
[08:22] <histo> dr_willis: probably like apple-ctrl-t if they have a control key
[08:22] <uman> histo: heh, do you work for the Long Arm of the Law ?
[08:22] <histo> dr_willis: no the mac keyboard is different
[08:22] <histo> uman: yes
[08:22]  * dr_willis sticks a mr uck over the appls

[08:23] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay, how is that done?
[08:23] <nabblet> kunji: of course it has flaws (usually the answer comes in parts and not as one message)...
[08:24] <histo> BroUnicorn: click on the softwware store > then mouse up to the top bar there are options up there for sources
[08:24] <histo> BroUnicorn: actually we could do it in terminal
[08:25] <histo> BroUnicorn: sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
[08:25] <kunji> nabblet: yeah, I was trying to envision how that might work, it would probably be more work that it's worth, we should probably just try to remember to put useful things we see in here on the wiki.
[08:25] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay! Terminal'd it- bunch of stuff popped up
[08:25] <histo> BroUnicorn: then find the line that has deb http://us.ubuntul..... precise main   just put a universe on the end of that line and ctrl+x to exit it will ask you to save
[08:26] <histo> BroUnicorn: not the lines that start #  those are comments the ones that start with deb
[08:26] <nabblet> kunji: if that would work, it would be already so :P
[08:26] <florian_> hello, my usb hub is failing once in a while. how can I find out if it's the hub, or the usb ports, or a software issue?

[08:28] <nytrix> what can really erase or scramble you HD so testdisk wont recover?
[08:28] <histo> BroUnicorn: okay on the one thats not the cd that has main add the word universe on the end of the line

[08:28] <uman> nytrix: or throw your drive in a river
[08:28] <histo> BroUnicorn: and hit ctrl+x to exit it will ask you to save the file
[08:28] <_sachin> dd can really screw ur HD
[08:28] <florian_> histo, hm ... "bash: check: command not found" can I install this application via synaptic?
[08:29] <histo> florian_: dmesg  should be on your system
[08:29] <florian_> histo, yeah! what lines should I have a look at?
[08:29] <histo> florian_: anything related to usb  you could do something like dmesg | grep usb
[08:29] <dr_willis> florian_:  the command is ''dmesg" as in  check the output of the dmesg command....
[08:29] <BroUnicorn> That has main? All three say main restricted. One says quantal, one says quantal-security, one says quantal-updates
[08:30] <histo> BroUnicorn: the quantal main one  put universe at the end
[08:30] <histo> BroUnicorn: if you can pastebint he file you are looking at I can tell you the line number

[08:31] <florian_> dr_willis, thanks
[08:31] <histo> florian_: I would start with something like dmesg | grep -i usb
[08:32] <BroUnicorn> histo: Added universe and ctrl+x saved
[08:32] <histo> BroUnicorn: okay sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install testdisk
[08:33] <BroUnicorn> Wait posting a picture still looking at something
[08:35] <florian_> histo, thank you, the  only error messages I got are "cannot enable port 1" "cannot enable port 2". What does that mean?
[08:35] <nabblet> BroUnicorn: just out of interest - are you using IRC from the LiveCD or other device?
[08:35] <histo> nabblet: irc from his phone
[08:36] <florian_> by the way the hub is working right now.
[08:36] <histo> nabblet: you can use irc from the live cd though
[08:36] <histo> florian_: means it can't enable port 1 and 2 I assume.
[08:36] <histo> florian_: try dmesg | grep -i -b2 usb
[08:36] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay picture not working: it's saying "File Name to Write: /etc/apt/sources.list" then options. This is after ctrl + x
[08:36] <nabblet> histo: yeah - might be more convenient - epecially for pasting stuff
[08:36] <BroUnicorn> nabblet: Colloquy on iPhone :D
[08:36] <histo> BroUnicorn: yeah press enter
[08:37] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay.
[08:37] <histo> BroUnicorn: did it exit?
[08:37] <florian_> histo,  yeah, that's what I thought  ;-) but what exactly is failing? trying your command suggestion
[08:37] <BroUnicorn> histo: Yeah. Doing update
[08:37] <histo> florian_: that new command will print a few lines before whatever line mentions usb
[08:38] <florian_> histo, yeah, I got that
[08:38] <florian_> got them, I mean
[08:38] <BroUnicorn> histo: Out of curiosity how will I save the files? All I have are DVD-R's
[08:38] <florian_> they're green numbers
[08:39] <BroUnicorn> histo: Unless I can somehow move them to my other partitions
[08:39] <_sachin> insert to an external USB storage or another partition
[08:39] <histo> BroUnicorn: we will save the flp files to the ram drive.  and you could burn them or write them back to the drive but I would advise against that.
[08:39] <dr_willis> Dropbox or ubuntu one
[08:39] <BroUnicorn> histo: Installing testdisk
[08:39] <histo> BroUnicorn: k
[08:39] <histo> BroUnicorn: flp files aren't that large right?
[08:40] <BroUnicorn> histo: No they aren't. They store settings for different plugins.
[08:40] <BroUnicorn> histo: Done installing testdisk!
[08:41] <florian_> histo, no, there are more lines! what should I be looking for?
[08:41] <histo> BroUnicorn: okay can you go to paste.ubuntu.com and copy and paste the output of sudo fdisk -l
[08:41] <histo> florian_: do you remember what time those errors were at?
[08:42] <florian_> histo, a few minutes ago
[08:42] <histo> florian_: or if you can pastebin the output of dmesg I'll take a look in a minute see if I can make heads or tails of it.
[08:42] <florian_> histo, yeah, just a minute, I'll pastebin the whole stuff
[08:43] <gumption> hello all! can anyone tell me how to add an app to my startup in ubuntu 12.10?
[08:43] <cloudgeek> is there any pdf to odt converter ?
[08:43] <BroUnicorn> histo: sure. Can we take it to messages?
[08:43] <BroUnicorn> histo: Or is this info not revealing
[08:43] <cloudgeek> if there is pdf to .doc converter why not .odt converter
[08:43] <cloudgeek> ?????
[08:43] <histo> BroUnicorn: no it's not revealing just post it to paste.ubuntu.com
[08:43] <NvidiaProblems>  hello, I have a lenovo thinkpad e530 (Nvidia's GT 630M graphic card) and I'm using lubuntu 12.04. After the last kernel update my monitor resolution is nomore correct. On the main monitor I can't swith to a resolution higer than 640x480 but on the external monitor I can configure the right resolution (1680x1050). I'm using arandr to configure the resolution. I tried to reinstall the nvidia drivers but jockey didn't show me any
[08:43] <NvidiaProblems> I tried to install the drivers from the nvidia site but it isn't fixing anything. May you please help me?
[08:43] <BroUnicorn> histo: paste.ubuntu.com/1537006
[08:44] <histo> NvidiaProblems: uninstall the ones from nvidia.com and sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[08:44] <kunji1> cloudgeek: There's a plugin that will let you do somethings.  But if you can convert it to .doc, then why not just convert the .doc to .odt?
[08:44] <histo> okay photorec /dev/sda
[08:44] <_sachin> @Nvidia** : kill and restart jockey
[08:44] <histo> BroUnicorn: photorec /dev/sda
[08:45] <histo> BroUnicorn: let me install photorec so I can remember the options
[08:45] <cloudgeek> kunji1: what is that plugin ?
[08:45] <_sachin> photorec comes in testdisk
[08:45] <histo> _sachin: I know we're beyond that
[08:45] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay. Did it. Im in the menu directly after that
[08:45] <NvidiaProblems> histo: doing that thanks. _sachin just did it and it is not working
[08:46] <histo> BroUnicorn: okay sudo photorec /dev/sda
[08:46] <histo> BroUnicorn: press enter to proceed at the first screen
[08:46] <BroUnicorn> Even though I already did photorec /dev/sda?
[08:46] <histo> BroUnicorn: no ignore that.
[08:47] <BroUnicorn> Okay. Pressing enter
[08:47] <histo> BroUnicorn: just press enter to proceed to the next screen
[08:47] <BroUnicorn> On the "select a media" screen
[08:47] <histo> BroUnicorn: no go to File Opt
[08:48] <histo> BroUnicorn: pres s to unselect all  and scroll down and make sure that flp is selected as a filetype since those are the only files we are concerned with
[08:48] <BroUnicorn> Okay does it matter what partition is selected?
[08:48] <NvidiaProblems> rebooting, thanks for the help, let's see if it works :)
[08:48] <histo> BroUnicorn: not while we are selecting file opt
[08:49] <_sachin> @Nvidia: try installing 'nouveau' drivers using synaptic

[08:50] <BroUnicorn> histo: Did it!
[08:50] <histo> BroUnicorn: it should be the only one X'd right?
[08:50] <BroUnicorn> Yes.
[08:51] <histo> BroUnicorn: select No partition the whole disk line
[08:51] <NvidiaProblems_> histo: thanks for the help but it didn't works. I uninstalled the nvidia.com drivers and installed nvidia-current using apt-get but the main monitor is still avaiable just in the 640x480 resolution
[08:51] <BroUnicorn> histo: Where is that? Im still on the list
[08:51] <histo> NvidiaProblems_: did you reboot
[08:51] <NvidiaProblems_> yes
[08:52] <histo> BroUnicorn: oh press enter to get back to the partitions list
[08:52] <_sachin> @Nvidia: try installing 'nouveau' drivers using synaptic
[08:52] <BroUnicorn> Okay I'm on the whole disk line
[08:52] <BroUnicorn> Choose search?
[08:53] <NvidiaProblems_> _sachin: I'm trying to avoid the nouveau drivers because they sucks a lot of resources in my experience, but I'll try that if I will not able to install the proprietary drivers
[08:53] <histo> BroUnicorn: yeap
[08:53] <BroUnicorn> "To recover lost files, Photorec need to know the file system type"
[08:54] <BroUnicorn> "...where the files were stored"
[08:54] <histo> BroUnicorn: choose Other
[08:54] <computer> Tried a few commands and looked on the net but how does one find out If Celeron 2.4 is i386 from terminal? Not the running version of Ubuntu but the CPU? Even Intel website does not say if i386, i586 or i686?
[08:54] <BroUnicorn> Okay! Now what?
[08:54] <histo> BroUnicorn: becuase it was ntfs partition
=== derek is now known as Guest16018
[08:54] <BroUnicorn> histo: Ahh, I see.
[08:54] <histo> BroUnicorn: okay now you can select a directory to save them to. you can just hit C to save to your current directory that you ran photorec from
[08:55] <BroUnicorn> histo: "Please select a destination to save"
[08:55] <nabblet> computer: cat /proc/cpuinfo
[08:55] <BroUnicorn> So this will just save to the temporary boot live disc?
[08:55] <computer> Thank u. Will try.
[08:56] <nabblet> computer: oh sorry - my command will not help you - was typing faster than i was thinking :P
[08:56] <histo> BroUnicorn: no it will save to a fake had drive made from RAM
[08:56] <computer> Sorry but "cat /proc/cpuinfo" does not say if i386, i586 or i686?
[08:56] <histo> BroUnicorn: so right now if you open a file browser and you should see some recup_dir's
[08:57] <iceroot> computer: lscpu
[08:57] <histo> computer: clflush size and cache alignment
[08:57] <computer> 64, 128?
[08:57] <histo> BroUnicorn: it wil place any recovered flp files in the recup_dir
[08:57] <histo> computer: 64bit cpu
[08:58] <BroUnicorn> Hmm im not seeing recup_dir
[08:58] <histo> computer: and lscpu will show you the architecture
[08:58] <BroUnicorn> I chose desktop
[08:58] <dufa> quit
[08:58] <computer> Thanks. It's i686 32bit.
[08:58] <histo> BroUnicorn: well when you open the file browser look int eh Desktop folder
[08:59] <BroUnicorn> I just see examples and install ubuntu
[08:59] <histo> BroUnicorn: is photorec still running?
[08:59] <BroUnicorn> But in the home folder I see photorec.ses
[08:59] <wpl_> How do i set the encoding for nfs shares? The man page doesnt specify any options for the encoding. Non-ASCII-characters are displayed as '?' in Terminal and Nautilus in NFS shares...
[09:00] <histo> BroUnicorn: yeah it creates a .ses file so that if you hit stop in the photorec window you can resume where it left off.
[09:00] <BroUnicorn> histo: Yes
[09:00] <histo> BroUnicorn: It will probably only create teh recup_dir.1 folder once it finds some files.  If it doesn't find any it will also create one to put a report.xml in
[09:00] <histo> BroUnicorn: be patient it will take a whiel.
[09:01] <histo> BroUnicorn: It's going through your hard drive sector by sector looking for any flp files.
[09:01] <BroUnicorn> histo: Okay. That makes sense

[09:01] <BroUnicorn> It'll be like an hour or so... So I have to go to sleep. I have Calc 3 in 4 hours. Haha
[09:02] <histo> BroUnicorn: when it finds the start of an flp file it will copy the data from the drive and dump it in the recup
[09:02] <BroUnicorn> histo: Can I add you to my buddy list?
[09:02] <histo> BroUnicorn: just remember you need to save those flp files from the recup directory to something before rebooting the livecd.  If you reboot you'll ahve to start over.
=== Guest14889 is now known as roba
[09:02] <Stephini2> does anyone know what OEM partitions are usually for?
[09:03] <histo> BroUnicorn: I don't think there are buddy lists on irc.
[09:03] <histo> Stephini2: recovery
[09:03] <BroUnicorn> Okay. Is there a way I can save this chat!
[09:03] <BroUnicorn> ?* there's a buddy list with my client
[09:03] <histo> BroUnicorn: copy and paste or it's logged
[09:03] <histo> BroUnicorn: well then I don't care if you add me to that.
[09:03] <Stephini2> histo, so if you are on a totally different OS than the original it should be fine to format. no? (if gparted can even that is...
[09:03] <BroUnicorn> Awesome. Man, I appreciate this incredibly.
[09:03] <histo> BroUnicorn: http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/
[09:04] <BroUnicorn> Even if nothing is recorded this is fantastic
[09:04] <Stephini2> most GUId clients have client side logging too... no?
[09:04] <histo> Stephini2: they usually put an image of the factory installed partitino with all the software the machine came with on that partition. So you can press like F12 while booting to recover to factory specs.  If you no longer want that you can delte that partiton and free up the space.
[09:04] <BroUnicorn> Okay, I looked at that log website
[09:05] <BroUnicorn> How would I find our conversation?
[09:05] <Stephini2> histo, i'm more worried about the fact that that partition is counting against my 4 partition limit preventing me from installing both win8 and ubuntu...heh
[09:05] <histo> BroUnicorn: BroUnicorn click on 2013 then the date the conversation took place
[09:06] <histo> BroUnicorn: http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/01/16/%23ubuntu.txt
[09:06] <Stephini2> histo can you conferm that gparted can delete that partition by chance? or does it require special jiggering? i noticed windows couldn't touch it...
[09:07] <histo> Stephini2: you can use extended partitoins
[09:07] <histo> Stephini2: no any partitioning tool should be able to delete it.
[09:07] <Stephini2> i was thinking about that...but does windows play nice with extended partitions? most times win doesn 't seem very smart about advanced features...
[09:07] <histo> Stephini2: it doesn't know the difference
[09:08] <Stephini2> ahh sweet thanx...
[09:08] <histo> Stephini2: well I wouldn't install windows to an extended I should say
[09:08] <Stephini2> ohh...
[09:08] <histo> Stephini2: You could try it though.
[09:08] <histo> Stephini2: I haven't played with the windows 8 installer
[09:08] <qc> think big
[09:08] <histo> florian_: sorry forgot i'm looking now
[09:08] <qc> helloooooooooooooooooo all
[09:08] <Stephini2> if i could just get the "install inside windows 8" button to not crash my laptop that woulda sorted everything...heh
[09:08] <florian_> histo, no worries
[09:08] <BroUnicorn> histo: I am very appreciative of what you've helped me with here. So when it saves... How can I save it with a DVD-r?
[09:09] <BroUnicorn> histo: Or can I not?
[09:09] <roba> if I have physical disks, can I have / on one and /var and /opt on the other?
[09:09] <roba> *2 physical disks
[09:09] <histo> florian_: is /dev/sdb plugged in via usb?
[09:09] <BroUnicorn> histo: Could I save it to a USB that already has a Ubuntu boot loader on it?
[09:10] <dr_willis> roba:  yes.  Or on partitions on the same disk
[09:10] <histo> BroUnicorn: yeah
[09:10] <histo> BroUnicorn: just plug the usb thumb drive in and tehre should be some free space still on there.
[09:10] <histo> florian_: and /dev/sdc perhaps?
[09:10] <roba> dr_willis, do I need to do it post-install? I want to avoid separate partitions because I dont know how they will grow as its a dev box
[09:11] <Stephini2> well thanx histo... sicne you advice against windows and extended parts i guess i'll just delete the OEM one.. thanx for all the help...*aways to work on her craptop*
[09:11] <dr_willis> Seperate partitions can make it easier at timez
[09:11] <histo> Stephini2: I would try it whats the worst that can happen.
[09:11] <BroUnicorn> histo: I aspire to be at your level. This is a perfect example of why I chose computer science as a major.
[09:11] <dr_willis> You could do it post install via a live cd
[09:12] <histo> BroUnicorn: keep in mind these aren't really advanced data recovery too9ls but they are free and they work.
[09:12] <roba> dr_willis, just modify fstab or is there something I need to be aware of?
[09:12] <Stephini2> BroUnicorn, just make sure it's not a crappy comunity college or tech uni...i made that mistake..they thought java was the end all be all of programming and it was the only language you needed for any job period... >.<
[09:12] <florian_> histo, I don't know. How can I find out?
[09:13] <histo> florian_: do you have external drives plugged in to the usb hub or thumb drives
[09:13] <dr_willis> If you got the fstab e skills. Go for it.

[09:15] <Stephini2> asta
[09:15] <_sachin> #Act 1
[09:15] <kunji1> Stephini2: ouch... Java...
[09:16] <histo> florian_: okay the two flash drives are /dev/sdb and /dev/sdc when the machine was upu. they were both getting I/O read errors when the hub went nuts
[09:16] <florian_> and the flash drives go into the ports as well, but I take the keyboard and the mouse out because otherwise the flash doesn't fit in. It's too thick(tall?? -- I'm not native with English)
[09:17] <florian_> histo, what are those kind of errors?
[09:17] <histo> florian_: I would suspect the hub is bad. Try plugging some stuff into your machine instead of the hub. sudo dmesg -c   to clear the dmesg log.  then after a while check dmesg see if the flash drives have any buffer I/O errors
[09:17] <histo> florian_: input output errors.
[09:18] <florian_> histo, I still have no idea what those kind of errors are and what they could come from. Someone else had suggested the ports might be "worn out", broken.
[09:19] <florian_> histo, I remember the flash drives themselves had similar problems as well when in the ports.
[09:19] <florian_> just failing without notice or warning
[09:19] <histo> histo: to translate... The errors start out hey can't communicate with your flash drive.  The furtehr on Hey can't communicate with your hub....
[09:20] <nabblet> if i want to install ubuntu on a SDD - do i need to use a specific filesystem or any other tool to make sure the SDD will not be unevenly stressed?
[09:20] <histo> florian_: It's hardware so it's hard to say but I would suspect the hub is bad.  Or try a completely different usb bus on the mother board to plug the hub into
[09:21] <nabblet> something like trying to spread the reads/writes evenly over the whole SSD and reducing log writes
[09:21] <histo> nabblet: yeah you can get rid of swap and do some other tuning

[09:22] <worm> I have just installed a new Ubuntu 12.04 LTS x86_64 with btrfs for /. However when I boot, I see something like "ERROR: sparse file not allowed".  Nothing wrong will happen if I just press somekey to continue. Is there anyway for me to ignore this error?
[09:22] <nabblet> histo: yeah tuning - i was just wondering if there is a packages for that or an official guide line (didn't find one) - after all there are some discussions about tuning and wht would be best - with a lot of voodoo-knowledge
[09:23] <florian_> histo, ok, I do as you suggested, clean the log and wait and see. I already thought I might buy another hub and see if it's working better. I don't know if there's another usb bus I could plug the hub into, but I'll try that as well, using a docking station. I'll be back earliest in an hour, rather in two hours. THANK YOU!
[09:23] <histo> nabblet: looks like a bunch of stuff on askubuntu or that page.
[09:23] <histo> florian_: it looks liek you have several usb bus's on your mother board
[09:24] <nabblet> histo: jep - have already seen most of the links - thanks. jsut was wondering if there is a one-liner i might have missed
[09:24] <histo> florian_: I see 3 in dmesg and the hub plugged into #1
[09:24] <histo> florian_: correction 4 and the hub plugged into #1
[09:25] <florian_> histo, thanks. I know that the errors occured also on the other usb port. I'll try the docking station next.
[09:26] <histo> florian_: just out of cureosity what is the video device plugged into usb?
[09:26] <histo> florian_: a webcam or something?
[09:27] <florian_> histo, there's none
[09:27] <florian_> maybe the video card uses a usb bus?
[09:28] <florian_> wouldn't think so, though

[09:33] <ubottu> cub: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[09:33] <dr_willis> text option in /etc/default/grub  ;)
[09:34] <histo> dr_willis: doesn't that still start gdb etc..
[09:34] <cloudgeek> histo: If you know how auto-complete words in office while we type?
[09:34] <histo> dr_willis: or whatever login manager we are using now adays
[09:34] <dr_willis> text mode does not start lightdm
[09:34] <dr_willis> thats like about the only thing it does... disables the login manager
[09:34] <histo> cloudgeek: http://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/OOoAuthors_User_Manual/Writer_Guide/Using_word_completion
[09:35] <dr_willis> and the framebuffer i think
[09:35] <histo> ligthdm that's it
[09:35] <cub> ty
[09:35] <histo> dr_willis: ewww why do they have to hate on teh framebuffer. It's nice having that in a console only system.
[09:36] <dr_willis> histo	 i find it slows down my console greatly at times
[09:36] <dr_willis> and some times you get framebuffer trying unsupported modes on some monitors
[09:36] <dr_willis> then theres the old issues the fb used to have with some drivers for X
[09:36] <dr_willis> ;)
[09:37] <xsobex787> does anyone here know how to support joomla?
[09:37] <cloudgeek> histo: it using enter instead of tab in bash
[09:37] <histo> dr_willis: I just want a full featured framebuffer browser is all
[09:38] <histo> dr_willis: some of them like chrome and webkit can be comiled with framebuffer but I haven't seen anyone with it working.
[09:38] <histo> dr_willis: when They do I can say goodbye to X
[09:38] <dr_willis> framebuffer is a neat idea.. but just never really took off.
[09:38] <histo> dr_willis: and all the text based browsers are dying.
[09:40] <histo> dr_willis: like you can play video in framebuffer no problems
[09:40] <Stephini2> histo, are they? i figured there were still enough "hardcore" people out there to give a demand.
[09:40] <dr_willis> some videos...
[09:40] <dr_willis> used geexbox for ages.. they eventually switched from framebuffer to X due to limitations
[09:41] <histo> dr_willis: vlc framebuffer
[09:41] <Stephini2> geexbox...isn't that something similar to XBMC?
[09:41] <dr_willis> its like a xmbcish live disrto.
[09:41] <dr_willis> i havent ised it in ages
=== mquin_ is now known as mquin
[09:42] <dr_willis> Openelec is a similer idea
[09:42] <Stephini2> lolz i haven't touched my xbox classic in years...
[09:42] <dr_willis> they have xbmc ported to android now
[09:42] <Stephini2> partly because i cant find my cables...a few times i've wanted it so i could stream movies to my 50" SDTV
[09:42] <histo> and xbmc for rasberrypi also they are puttingn it on everything.
[09:43] <dr_willis> I have several xbmc variant disrtos for my raspberry pi
[09:43] <Stephini2> everything except xbox 360... :P
=== a is now known as Guest47059
[09:43] <histo> I want to get a rpi but i've been too busy playing with arduino stuff.
[09:43] <dr_willis> theres that xbmcbuntu variant also
[09:43] <dr_willis> i got 2 pi's - on one right now via znc
[09:44] <aeon-ltd> histo: but they have different range of uses...
[09:44] <dr_willis> shame theres no PiBuntu.
[09:45] <aeon-ltd> dr_willis: isn't raspbian close enough?
[09:45] <dr_willis> yep. for me
[09:45] <japplo> hi guys, is a  /boot btrfs partition possible?
[09:46] <dr_willis> hmm. i think its possible.. but i would bet its not a good idea
[09:46] <histo> dr_willis: why do you use znc why not jsut use screen?
[09:46] <rmbell> logging, using other irc clients, etc
[09:46] <dr_willis> im using my android phone and andchat --> znc   to here
[09:47] <Guest47059> hi , pls how to create empty directory structure on fat32 usb?
[09:47] <histo> dr_willis: yeah I just ssh to my server and resume my scrreen session usually
[09:47] <histo> Guest47059: like format it you mean?
[09:47] <dr_willis> i just jump on any pc/irc client and znc in.. and im here
[09:48] <histo> dr_willis: so what is znc jstu an irc server that bounces out?
[09:48] <rmbell> irc bouncer, yeah
[09:48] <dr_willis> !info znc
[09:48] <ubottu> znc (source: znc): advanced modular IRC bouncer. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.206-2 (quantal), package size 1246 kB, installed size 2967 kB
[09:49] <dr_willis> its handy
[09:49] <histo> dr_willis: so any irc client can connect to it basically right?
[09:49] <dr_willis> exactly
[09:49] <histo> We're basically doing the same thing i'm just using ssh
[09:49] <dr_willis> at the same time even
[09:50] <Guest47059> histo yes, only copy of my ubuntu dir structure, without files
[09:50] <dr_willis> i have 3 pcs going and a phone.. all are connected to the znc server.. i  can hop around
[09:50] <histo> Guest47059: what ubuntu dir structure on a fat32 drive?  I'm really confused now.
[09:50] <histo> dr_willis: Yeah you could accomplish the same with ssh and screen
[09:50] <dr_willis> i can do more with ssh
[09:51] <dr_willis> and i dont have to find a ssh client for the phone thats useable.. :) still havent foiund a good one
[09:51] <Guest47059> ok on empty usb key, not fat32 usb
[09:51] <dr_willis> znc has other features however then i use
[09:51] <histo> dr_willis: connect_bot is good. there's another one I can't think of that I use.
[09:51] <Stephini2> i'm going to go out on a limb and assume that ext4 is the best partition type for ubuntu?
[09:51] <dr_willis> connectbot is not good.. i had major issues with it
[09:52] <histo> !best | Stephini2
[09:52] <ubottu> Stephini2: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[09:52] <dr_willis> then theres the connectbot-rip-off clones
[09:52] <histo> dr_willis: yeah there was one I found that worked awesome with screen like sideways swipe moved from each screen
[09:52] <dr_willis> been using ''server auditor' as a ssh client on the phone lately. it has issues.. but it works
[09:52] <histo> dr_willis: can't remember the name of it now
[09:53] <dr_willis> i have issues with many ssh clients on android not working well with the keyboards on android
[09:53] <Guest47059> histo: ok on empty usb key, not on fat32 usb
[09:53] <dr_willis> either virtual or real keybords
[09:53] <histo> dr_willis: I'm searching play store now
[09:53] <Stephini2> histo, ok then if best is the wrong term...is there any reason to choose it against say ntfs? (really hope this isn't a poll...doesn't seem to be to me...but i'm rather daft so who knows)
[09:53] <histo> Guest47059: what "ubuntu" directories do you mean?
[09:53] <histo> Guest47059: you aren't making any sense
[09:54] <rmbell> Stephini2:  lots of reasons to pick a native linux FS over NTFS
[09:54] <ponze> Guest47059: you mean you want / and all subdirs on the usb?!
[09:54] <Guest47059> histo: i dont have hdd, only usb and dvd
[09:54] <dr_willis> i can do shell commands via my irc client through znc.  so i dont ssh in much these days
[09:54] <Stephini2> things such as greater stability and speed?
[09:54] <histo> dr_willis: irssi connect bot is nice
[09:54] <rmbell> Stephini2:  yes
[09:54] <histo> dr_willis: if you use irssi
[09:55] <dr_willis> histo:  i had to many issues with it. and i use weechat.
[09:55] <histo> dr_willis: yeah /exec -o is nice
[09:55] <dr_willis> i can get a shell in a irc window with znc no need for  /exec
[09:55] <histo> Guest47059: What do you want on the usb drive? Just a blank drive that you can plop files on?
[09:56] <histo> dr_willis: yeah with weechat
[09:56] <dr_willis> without weechat. ;)  with any irc client - i can have a shell via znc
[09:56] <histo> dr_willis: actually i'm in weechat now. didn't notice
[09:56] <dr_willis> a slightly limited shell.
[09:56] <Guest47059> yes where i can install new programs and after that i can update my dvd with it..
[09:57] <dr_willis> install programs onto a flash drive then do what with them?
[09:57] <histo> Guest47059: do you want to run ubuntu from a usb?
[09:57] <histo> Guest47059: ex: plug it in to your computer restart and boot to it and use Ubuntu off of that?
[09:58]  * histo scratches head
[09:58] <Stephini2> ok a bit of research makes it seem like windows doesn't play well with ext3 and ext4. is that about right or am i reading old info?
[09:58] <Guest47059> yes, run sys from dvd, work with usb space, and someties move usb files to dvd/ update
[09:58] <rmbell> Stephini2:  windows doesnt play well with most things
[09:58] <dr_willis> you can boot  the dvd. then copy select files to the usb.. but not install apps to the usb
[09:59] <histo> !usb | Guest47059
[09:59] <ubottu> Guest47059: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[09:59] <histo> Guest47059: also what files are you trying to send me?
[09:59] <Stephini2> lolz quite true but for my needs i need to take into concideration windows.
[09:59] <Guest47059> i think with same dir structure i can
[09:59] <histo> Guest47059: you want persistent live usb
[09:59] <histo> Guest47059: directions it sounds like.
[09:59] <rmbell> Stephini2:  you can access NTFS fine from linux, but you cant acess ext4 from windows
[09:59] <dr_willis> you do a live install to the usb or a full install.. you can.. Im not sure you can boot a dvd and setup  a persistant file on a usb that will work with the dvd
[10:00] <dr_willis> and you dont just make   /SYSTEM type directories on the usb and expect the usb to automatically use them
[10:01] <Guest47059> dr_willis: k thx
[10:01] <Stephini2> rmbell any tips on a good alternative for someone who wants windows to have access to all partitions? like is ext2 too ancient to be concidered, ect. sorry for all this newbishness...last time i used linux was fedora moonshine and i had a third party vista app to access ext3...although it was buggy as heck.
[10:02] <zalgor> hello. I want to remove the "shutdown/reboot" item from the system menu (LTS 12.04, gnome). I don't want to disable or touch the lightdm poweroff/reboot options. Any hints or ideas?
[10:02] <dr_willis> zalgor:  gnome shell or unity?
[10:02] <zalgor> dr_willis, gnome shell
[10:03] <histo> dr_willis: isnt' ther a weechat plugin/script that lists all the scripts availible online?
[10:03] <dr_willis> zalgor:  check out the gnome shell extensions web site
[10:03] <dr_willis> histo:  'weeget'    i belive
[10:04] <dr_willis> histo:  ive cloned my weeget  settings dir to so many pcs i forget what all ive installed ;)
[10:04] <dr_willis> histo:  i did figure out how to make all mode changes go to a select channel buffer also - so i dont see all the bans and kicks in here.
[10:04] <histo> dr_willis: yeah I think that's it
[10:05] <histo> yeap
[10:05] <dr_willis> weechat has some very nice features once you learn the basics of it
[10:06] <rmbell> Stephini2:  serve the files over IP instead of accessing the partition directly, most likely easiest
[10:06] <histo> dr_willis: Yeah I set it up ages ago and can't remember how I did my ignores and all that. I bounce betweent irssi and weechat just depends on what I type in if this box ever restarts.
[10:06] <Atomsk> Hello. Can anyone tell me how to use Ububtu 12.10 to chkdsk a hardrive with windows installed on it?
[10:07] <histo> Stephini2: You could create samba shares and windows could browse them.
[10:07] <Stephini2> rmbell that wont help on dual boot will it?
[10:07] <Stephini2> same question to histo... :P
[10:07] <Atomsk> P.S. running 12.10 from live CD
[10:08] <rmbell> no, but might as well just run ubuntu from a VM on windows then :)
[10:08] <Stephini2> decided "screw windows" anyway...heh...will the installer auto create the swap or do i hafta do that?
[10:08] <rmbell> guided partitioning creates a swap
[10:09] <subdesign> installing an app from software center and with apt installs the same verzion?
[10:09] <histo> Atomsk: sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g ntfsprogs   then use sudo fdisk -l to figure out which /dev/sdax is your NTFS drive. Then sudo ntfsfix /dev/devicename
[10:09] <rmbell> subdesign:  yes
[10:09] <subdesign> thx
[10:09] <Stephini2> ahh kk...now i just gotta worry that windows, windows sys, ubuntu, and ubuntu swap will prolly eat my 4 partitions so i wont have the ability to create a storage partition...this is starting to be a PITA...
[10:09] <dr_willis> i dident think ntfsfix actually fixed anything.. it just flagged it as 'good'
[10:10] <histo> Atomsk: the ntfsfix program may be included ont he livecd by default.
[10:10] <Atomsk> histo: keeps saying package ntfsprogs has no insallation candidate
[10:10] <rmbell> Stephini2: storage can be a logical partion, doesnt need to be primary
[10:10] <rmbell> you can also use LVM
[10:10] <dr_willis> you can instgall linux in logical partions in  an extended partition  Stephini2
[10:10] <Stephini2> logical? hrm earlier the part manager wouldn't even let me create more than 4 period...
[10:11] <histo> !info ntfsprogs
[10:11] <ubottu> ntfsprogs (source: ntfs-3g): read/write NTFS driver for FUSE (transitional package). In component universe, is optional. Version 1:2012.1.15AR.5-4ubuntu3 (quantal), package size 1 kB, installed size 45 kB

[10:11] <Stephini2> well thanx i'mma go try to figure this crap out.
[10:11] <vamadir> hi, ubuntu have some vacancy forums?
[10:11] <histo> Atomsk: yeah so it's included on livecd
[10:12] <dr_willis> !forums | vamadir
[10:12] <roba> cifs still used for ntfs?

[10:14] <jil> Excepte from a bad memory, any idea why I would get different md5sum on the same ubuntu.iso ?
[10:15] <Stephini2> gerr..installer just told me i need to manually create my swap partition... >.< well off to figure out hwo big i'm supposed to make it
[10:15] <dr_willis> Stephini2:  deoennds on your needs.
[10:15] <jil> Stephini2, make it 2GB
[10:15] <jil> not more
[10:15] <dr_willis> Stephini2:  ram+ a little bit moar if you want to uise the hibernate features
[10:16] <Stephini2> lolz is there any way to look it up? i have either 1 or 2 on that system...
[10:16] <dr_willis> if you have 2gb of ram.. id make a 2.5 gb swap.. unless you are really tight on hd space
[10:16] <Stephini2> from within the installer i mean
[10:16] <Stephini2> lolz sadly my laptop is doing great for space...my gaming rig on the other hand... >.<
[10:17] <jil> from the installer I don't know but as you start your computer it should tell you how much ram you have.
[10:17] <Stephini2> so should i just do 2500 or actually do the math for the actual MB figure?
[10:17] <jil> if not go in the bios.
[10:17] <dr_willis> dosent really matter.. just get close
[10:17] <Stephini2> ahh kk
[10:17] <Stephini2> thanx
[10:18] <Atomsk> histo: thx, got in to it and ran ntfsfix, seemed to run pretty quick... did that actually chkdsk???
[10:18] <dr_willis> Atomsk:  i thought it dident actually fix anything...
[10:18] <dr_willis> Atomsk:  best to recheck from a windows box asap
[10:19] <ActionParsnip> Stephini2: 2500 will do
[10:19] <jil> Except from bad memory, what can cause my brand new netinstall of ubuntu to give different md5sum on the same image disk?
=== AlphaS is now known as Ygrec
[10:20] <dr_willis> jil where did the image come from? differnt from what?
[10:20] <x-os_pal> hello! after installing mplayer and smplayer and verifying that all the media codes in the world are in /usr/lib/codecs i'm still not able to play wmv in smplayer...help please?
[10:20] <jil> it's the ubuntu LTS image
[10:20] <ActionParsnip> x-os_pal: install w32codecs from medibuntu
[10:21] <dr_willis> x-os_pal:  wmv can contain DRM and other codecs that dont exist on linux.  (or cant work on linux)
[10:21] <jil> I'm running md5sum several times on the same ubuntu.iso file and I several results.  :)
[10:21] <dr_willis> normally you can run th e player from a terminal and it will spit out codec info about the files
[10:21] <dr_willis> jil that is odd..
[10:22] <dr_willis> jil could be a hd issue
[10:22] <jil> I get several resulst.  I suspect my memory to have a problem but I'de like to hear other stories if you have
[10:22] <Stephini2> now i just gotta get the latest websphere or whatever it's called on win8 and a good ftp client on my linux and i can start working on my website...
[10:22] <x-os_pal> ActionParsnip: just verified that i have installed that
[10:22] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: works fine on arch -_-
[10:22] <dr_willis> better to use ssh/sftp then  ftp Stephini2
[10:22] <Atomsk> ugh, yeah, xecpt it's a laptop, the hard drive is burried deep inside, can't run windows chkdsk from command line cause don't now admin password, orphcrack password hack can't find anything, plus I think it's got two bad sticks of memory
[10:22] <dr_willis> x-os_pal:  determine what codec the file is using
[10:22] <ActionParsnip> x-os_pal: try installing vlc
[10:23] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: MSS2
[10:23] <dr_willis> i find vlc beats mplayer most of the time these days
[10:23] <x-os_pal> ActionParsnip: i have..VLC tells me there isnt any way to play MSS2
[10:23] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: agreed
[10:23] <Stephini2> dr_willis my godaddy has FTP access...dunno if it even supports ssh/sftp...but if it does i suspect that will cost extra so should wait till my site is actually receiving traffic before worrying about security...heh
[10:23] <dr_willis> check the mplayer and vlc forums  - and search for the mss2 codec - there may be known issues
[10:24] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: will do. be back soon with news.
[10:24] <Ben64> Atomsk: its very easy to remove passwords from windows installs
[10:24] <dr_willis> if its a wmv.. id convert it to a better format. ;)
[10:30] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: after finding solutions like convert the files or use windows...that really arent solutions at all i tried playing one of those MSS2 wmv vids with mplayer from terminal and it worked just fine...any clue as to what i should do for smplayer to have similar reseults
[10:31] <Ben64> smplayer is mplayer, they should work the same : /
[10:31] <dr_willis> smplayer uses mplayer as its backend..
[10:31] <x-os_pal> Ben64: that's what i though.
[10:31] <dr_willis> you mean mplayer on a differnt disrto vs smplayer on ubuntu?
[10:31] <x-os_pal> damn...my typing is all over the place today...sorry all
[10:31] <dr_willis> run from terminal. look for error messages when you play it
[10:32] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: i'm using bodhi on an atom netbook with 2GB ram...i really wanted to see whats up with E17 final. i come from arch. everything i've tried just now with the wmv files is on bodhi
[10:32] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: righto
[10:33] <Ben64> you realize this is #ubuntu , right?
[10:33] <dr_willis> so let s clarify... mplayer works on bodhi for the same file.. thsat dosent work on smplayer on ubuntu?
[10:33] <x-os_pal> Ben64: bodhi is ubuntu
[10:33] <Ben64> no
[10:33] <dr_willis> bodhi is not ubuntu.
[10:34]  * tuannie test
[10:34] <dr_willis> smplayer calls mplayer with specific options.. so it may be some incompatable option
[10:34] <Ben64> i don't even have smplayer installed, mplayer is all the player I need
[10:35] <x-os_pal> it's an ubuntu derivative..i don't see how trouble shooting my issue on ubuntu or on bodhi can have that big a difference...anywho, smplayer ran from terminal gives me no errors. howerever smplayer does 'play' the video in 8 second inrements with no audio
[10:36] <dr_willis> they could be compiling in differnt options or all sorts of things...
[10:36] <dr_willis> so..  now its 'neither smplayer or mplayer' play the video correctly?
[10:36] <Ben64> we just can't support every single thing that is based on ubuntu. they change things and stuff we say could not work, or break it.
[10:37] <Ben64> plus the number of derivatives is already huge and growing still
[10:37] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: well thanks for your patience any way. mplayer plays it just fine..via terminal of corse. smplayer plays video in 8second increments with no audio
[10:38] <x-os_pal> Ben64: in understand that. but i doubt theres a better place to go than here. only looking for help finding a solution..not looking for someone to do all the work for me buddy
[10:39] <Ben64> #bodhilinux
[10:40] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: oh...now smplayer is playing the video just fine with no audio..ha!
[10:40] <dr_willis> google says mplayer supports mss2 via  the avcodec package.. that package has dozens of compile time options as to what  it may or may not support on a given disrto
[10:40] <dr_willis> and the mss codec seems to be very much experimental from the google hits ive seen
[10:40] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: excellent. that's a great place to start. thanks.
[10:41] <dr_willis> only wmv files i see on a regular basis are.. well.. lets say.. from adult ssites..
[10:41] <x-os_pal> Ben64: it's naive to think that i haven't already tried that but thanks anyway..
[10:42] <ActionParsnip> dr_willis: could convert the file :)
[10:42] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: in my googling and personal issue ive fonud lots of people looking for answers for certification track videos other than porn =p
[10:42] <dr_willis> ActionParsnip:  if ffmpeg or mpolayer have the right options compiled in
[10:42] <dr_willis> x-os_pal:  and those would have DRM protection on them
[10:42] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: its all educational..i supppse
[10:43] <Ben64> x-os_pal: "i doubt theres a better place to go than here." #bodhilinux is literally the place to go on irc for bodhi support
[10:43] <dr_willis> which would be why players on linux have such issues

[10:44] <nabblet> histo: btw, did the filerecovery of that dude previously work? (fruity loops on mac book and win OS)
[10:44] <Hell_Fire> I've got an issue, been trying to work out of ubuntu would be a decent replacement for my debian server, is just a home server, nothing production quality :P.  But it's main storage is btrfs on LUKS cryptdisks, and replicating that setup on a VM, I'm seeing all kinds of race conditions in the init side.  Originally I was getting btrfs-tools not adding an upstart job to scan devices for mounting (debian has a similar bug in it's init
[10:44] <Hell_Fire> for it, which is why I looked), but now I've got cryptdisks-enable not getting run till after mountall has run, workaround would be to have another upstart job mount the fs as cryptdisks-enable enters stopped, but it's a hack and doesn't give me the nice functionality of halting the boot if the filesystem is unavailable (since my home is a subvolume on the btrfs system, I'd like it to come up with the rest of the local filesystems)
[10:44] <dr_willis> I wont even mention this Malware WMV one co-worker  managed to find...    still not sure how it infected his windows box.. but  i made $20 with a ubuntu live cd recoverying the data
[10:44] <zvacet> x-os_pal: do you use 64 bit version?
[10:45] <Ben64> dr_willis: $20? man you gotta start charging $60 an hour at least
[10:46] <dr_willis> Ben64:  he would do machine shop work for me. ;)
[10:46] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: you think so? thanks for all the guidence! off to put it to good use.
[10:46] <Ben64> or that :D
[10:46] <spexi> Hi! When I want to find out is certain software installed, is there a way to do it without knowing the exact name? e.g. apt-cache policy apache finds nothing, I have to first do apt-cache search apache (with lots and lots of rows) and then I scroll the results and find out package name apache2. After that I can only do the apt-cache policy apache2.
[10:46] <x-os_pal> zvacet: no 32-bit
=== BotaniCar is now known as BotaniCarSEAT
[10:46] <dr_willis> spexi:  look into apt-file perhaps?
[10:46] <Ben64> spexi: dpkg -l | grep apache
[10:46] <nabblet> spexi: i think dpkg -l will give you a lsit of all installed packages - then you can use grep oir scroll
[10:46] <nabblet> *or
[10:47] <spexi> ah, okay
[10:47] <spexi> thanks to all of you
[10:47] <x-os_pal> Ben64: you would have a great point provided that the fine folk at #bodhilinux knew as much about ubuntu t-shooting over E17 t-shooting
[10:47] <zvacet> x-os_pal: because I found (maybe it is changed in mean time) that you can use that codecs only in 32 bit version with w32 codecs installed see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2071229
[10:48] <Ben64> x-os_pal: then maybe you should use ubuntu
[10:49] <kunji1> Where did you even find an MSS2 file....
[10:49] <x-os_pal> Ben64: i tried that once...then i couldnt for the life of me figure out how to become root...like real root. i don't mean to start a dirto-war in an ubuntu irc channel so i won't start comparing arch to ubuntu..not in here at least. =p
[10:49] <x-os_pal> zvacet: yea i stumbled upon that too in my google-ing thanks though!
[10:50] <zvacet> x-os_pal: real root    sudo -i
[10:50] <zvacet> x-os_pal: bodhi comes with very few things installed did you install ubuntu-restricted-extras w32 codecs etc...
[10:51] <x-os_pal> zvacet: not a fan of the way ubuntu basterdized the whole sudoers thing...yes of course
[10:51] <Ben64> you don't make any sense. you don't like ubuntu so you use bodhi, but you refuse to use their help and come to #ubuntu instead
[10:52] <Hell_Fire> what's bastardized about it? sudo is sudo, su is su :P
=== bloom is now known as Reda
[10:52] <zvacet> Ben64: bodhi is based on 12.04 with e17  ;)
[10:52] <Ben64> but we don't support "based on"
[10:52] <nearst> hi ppl
[10:52] <jpds> !root | x-os_pal
[10:52] <ubottu> x-os_pal: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[10:53] <iceroot> zvacet: and ubuntu is based on debian but this is not the debian-support channel and debian is not the ubuntu support channel
[10:53] <Ben64> !backtrack
[10:53] <ubottu> There are some Ubuntu derivatives that we cannot provide support for due to repository and software changes. Please consult their websites for more information. Examples: gNewSense (support in #gnewsense), Linux Mint (see !mint), LinuxMCE (support in #linuxmce), CrunchBang (support in #crunchbang), BackTrack (support in #backtrack-linux)
[10:53] <ActionParsnip> x-os_pal: how is it bastardized?
[10:54] <zvacet> iceroot: but ubuntu doesn´t use debian repos itsn´t it? basiclly he use precise with e17
[10:54] <ActionParsnip> zvacet: no, and mixing the 2 will give you issues
[10:54] <iceroot> zvacet: he is not using an official ubuntu release so its offtopic
[10:54] <dr_willis> hmm i thought ubuntu used sudo pretty much as it was written
[10:54] <ActionParsnip> dr_willis: me too, its used as designed
[10:55] <dr_willis> or at least thats what i gathered from the sudo home page. ;)
[10:55] <Ben64> just can't do "su" to get a root shell like you can on other distros
[10:55] <dr_willis> actually im finding more and more disrtos going that route.
[10:55] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: you can use su to become other users though
[10:55] <Ben64> yep
[10:56] <Hell_Fire> Ben64: sure you can, but su isn't just for (s)witch (u)ser to root though :P
[10:56] <ActionParsnip> Hell_Fire: you'd need the root pass, which doesn't exist in ubuntu
[10:56] <anathema_> hi i get a black screen after trying to boot from usb/dvd the ubuntu 12.10 (in laptop with preinstalled win8)
[10:56] <Hell_Fire> ActionParsnip: sudo passwd root :P
[10:56] <anathema_> using x64
[10:56] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: what video chip do you use
[10:56] <Ben64> Hell_Fire: nooo
[10:56] <ActionParsnip> Hell_Fire: thats not needed, or advvised

[10:56] <dr_willis> sudo sudo sudo cd
[10:57] <ActionParsnip> Hell_Fire: you can use:  sudo -i    and get a root prompt
[10:57] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, nvidia
[10:57] <Hell_Fire> I know that :P
[10:57] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: try the boot option:  nouveau.blacklist=1
[10:57] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, nvidia (Asus Laptop)
[10:57] <Hell_Fire> I'm an oldhat, ignore me :P
[10:57] <Ben64> anathema_: does it have the dual gpu thingy?
[10:57] <ActionParsnip> Hell_Fire: so why enable the account when its not needed?
[10:57] <anathema_> Ben64, idk
[10:58] <kunji1> What do you mean you can't su to be root?
[10:58] <Ben64> anathema_: could you give us the model number?
[10:58] <anathema_> yeah
[10:58] <Ben64> kunji1: on other distros, you can do "su" then type in your root password to become root. that doesn't work on ubuntu
[10:58] <kunji1> Ben64: huh, but you just sudo su, no?
[10:58] <Hell_Fire> Because /root is on the root device, and for those running /home on a seperate partiton/nfs/whatever it's handy to not scatter stuff all over the system
[10:59] <iceroot> kunji1: sudo su is wrong
[10:59] <zvacet> Ben64: sudo -i
[10:59] <Ben64> sudo -i if you really need to
[10:59] <nearst> su -
[10:59] <Hell_Fire> But again, oldhat, ignore me :P
[10:59] <kunji1> iceroot: Could you explain why, it's all I had heard for it until quite recenlty
[10:59] <nearst> nah.. sudo is beauty of ubuntu, why dont use it!
[10:59] <ActionParsnip> kunji1: sudo -i   uses the user profile. dead handy
[11:00] <iceroot> kunji1: sudo su = calling su as root and that is setting the env wrong, because sudo already gave you root access, so you are using su as root to become root
[11:00] <ActionParsnip> Hell_Fire: yues but its a security risk, so i'd say its a bad hat to have, not old
[11:00] <anathema_> Ben64, ASUS A55VD-SX406H with Geforce 610M (2gb)
[11:01] <anathema_> I've tried to disable Fast boot / secure boot
[11:01] <kunji1> iceroot: does that introduce any actual issues?
[11:01] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: yep, dual gpu
[11:01] <Hell_Fire> no, insecure passphrases are a security risk full stop, once an attacker is in the system, they're only a local exploit or poorly configured system away from root anyway
[11:01] <iceroot> kunji1: sure
[11:01] <ActionParsnip> Hell_Fire: but reducing active accounts, especially common ones like root is advantageous
[11:01] <iceroot> kunji1:  a wrong enviroment
[11:02] <iceroot> kunji1: maybe a wrong PATH or wrong locale settings
[11:02] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: you will want the ubuntu bumblebee how to
[11:02] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, ok where i can find it
[11:02] <nearst> go debian if wanna use root user :)
[11:02] <ActionParsnip> Hell_Fire: plus its not supported or advised in Ubuntu
[11:02] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: seek and ye shall find
[11:02] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, this laptop has UEFI and Win8 Preinstalled, Is there away for dual boot?
[11:03] <ActionParsnip> nearst: you can use root in ubuntu, just getting to it is slightly different
[11:03] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: not sure with uefi, never had the misfortune to use it
[11:03] <Hell_Fire> sure, but so is running things like denyhosts, linux is linux is linux, doesn't matter the distro :P
[11:03] <nearst> ActionParsnip, ya. i know. im always use root anyway :)
[11:03] <x-os_pal> i appologize for starting this sudo debate. i guess it's a personal thing cause i lost a great job moving everything over to linux in a medium-sized A/V equipment company because their full time sysadmin couldnt literally log in as root with ubuntu and when i mentioned something like arch he said 'what..no..'
[11:03] <crk> anathema_: There is a way
[11:03] <iceroot> nearst: debian expert installation is not creating a root account, its using the same sudo thing that ubuntu is using
[11:03] <crk> It's documented on the Ubuntu site
[11:03] <kunji1> iceroot: Hmm, you're saying that sudo then you use the user's environment, and sudo su you will use root's?  But then sudo -i, you still use the regular user's , or root's?
[11:04] <iceroot> kunji1: roots
[11:04] <crk> anathema_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFIBooting
[11:04] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, i found that https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee but I cannot boot with live usb/dvd only Black
[11:04] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: try the boot option I gave earlier
[11:04] <nearst> iceroot, ya. i agree that. root use will damage the system. especially rm -rf / :)
[11:04] <Hell_Fire> x-os_pal: sounds like their fulltime sysadmin didn't know what they were on about
[11:04] <iceroot> nearst: that will do nothing
[11:04] <kunji1> iceroot: If what I said above was correct, then I don't see the difference between sudo su (use root's) and sudo -i (again use root's).
[11:04] <iceroot> nearst: but yes i know what you mean
[11:05] <x-os_pal> Hell_Fire: that's how things work in greece man...
[11:05] <nearst> iceroot, np. sharing is caring :)
[11:05] <Hell_Fire> x-os_pal: happens alot everywhere :)
[11:05] <iceroot> kunji1: as i already said sudo su = calling su as root, 1. it must be su - instead of su, 2. it will set the env wrong
[11:06] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, after the quiet splash --?
[11:06] <iceroot> kunji1: sudo su is the same as
[11:06] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, I typed "e" in "Try ubuntu..."
[11:06] <iceroot> kunji1: su -c su
[11:06] <nearst> if wanna use root at ubuntu. do sudo passwd (root passwd) then su - (root passwd) for root@localhost name :P
[11:06] <iceroot> kunji1: and that is wrong because you will not have the correct environemtn
[11:06] <iceroot> kunji1: sudo i is not calling a program as root to become root
[11:07] <Myrtti> nearst: no.
[11:07] <iceroot> kunji1: sudo su is calling a program as root to become root. for further infos see "man sudo"
[11:07] <Ben64> why do people keep wanting a root password?
[11:07] <lhavelund> nearst: We don't support that here.
[11:07] <lhavelund> !root | nearst
[11:07] <ubottu> nearst: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[11:07] <iceroot> nearst: you dont need a root shell, use sudo  like sudo apt-get
[11:08] <MonkeyDust> Ben64  I guess because they don't like enetering the password a lot
[11:08] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: remove quiet splash and in its place add nouveau.blacklist=1
[11:08] <MonkeyDust> entering*
[11:08] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, thanks
[11:08] <Ben64> MonkeyDust: but it remembers it for a while
[11:08] <nearst> ya. i know. im use sudo instead.
[11:08] <kunji1> iceroot: take a second and try it, works fine as "sudo su" doesn't need to be "sudo su -" 2. how is the environment wrong, root's environment should be expected in this case?  I'll read that man page though, maybe we're miscommunicating.
[11:08] <iceroot> nearst: fine :)
[11:08] <lhavelund> nearst: Then please don't suggest it to the channel.
[11:08] <ActionParsnip> nearst: just use:  sudo -i    no need for anything else...simples
[11:08] <x-os_pal> i tried telling him all that including things about the interative flag but he said he wanted to type 'root' as a login and throw a pass at it and become root. any who....
[11:08] <Hell_Fire> you guys go around bickering over basic stuff too much, still nothing about my cryptdisk + btrfs + mountall upstart problem :P
[11:08] <nearst> okies. no worries. just sharing
[11:09] <kunji1> ActionParsnip: sudo cd ... oh wait...
[11:09] <dyd> guys what's a nice shell with colored text?
[11:09] <ActionParsnip> kunji1: you will be able to traverse all folders as user
[11:09] <lhavelund> dyd: ...bash?
[11:09] <ActionParsnip> dyd: ncurses ...?
[11:09] <x-os_pal> dyd: zsh
[11:09] <wdp> ActionParsnip, ncurses is a shell?
[11:09] <dyd> thanks
[11:09] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, worked! one last question, I run now Ubuntu in Live mode, Can I install it dual booting with Win8 by partitioning the disk in Ubuntu installer?
[11:09] <ActionParsnip> wdp: no idea, it has nice colours though
[11:10] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: not used win8 at all. I can't really comment. Maybe there are videos on youtube and similar. The dual gpu will probably give you grief
[11:10] <iceroot> nearst: sudo su does not preserve the environment variables of the original shell.
[11:10] <zvacet> anathema_: I think it is better idea to shrink partition from Windows
[11:10] <iceroot> nearst: its that simple. try it out yourself
[11:10] <anathema_> zcacet ok thanks I will try it in Windows
[11:11] <zvacet> anathema_:then on unallocated space install ubuntu
[11:11] <nearst> iceroot, allright
[11:11] <kunji1> ActionParsnip: not true, and trying sudo cd <filename> returns "sudo: cd: command not found"  has done this for ages.
[11:11] <iceroot> nearst: you will see sudo su will act different then sudo -i or su
[11:11] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, thanks for the help. After Installing Ubuntu 12.10. I must install some restricted drivers for nvidia dual ?
[11:11] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[11:11] <ActionParsnip> anathema_: you can use bumblebee
[11:12] <hexabit> Godmorning! :)
[11:13] <lhavelund> Good morning, hexabit.
[11:13] <kunji1> iceroot: So what you're actually saying is that what I said earlier was incorrect, aka, using sudo -i you actually do NOT use root's environment, I asked if what I said was correct.
[11:13] <Hell_Fire> su by itself passes the current environment to the new shell, su - or su -l sets it up more like a fresh login shell, as does sudo -i
[11:13] <nearst> iceroot, ty for info
[11:13] <Hell_Fire> sudo -i does use roots environment
[11:14] <hexabit> lhavelund: lhavelund is that a swedish name?
[11:14] <Hell_Fire> just run export under the new shells to see the differences :P
[11:14] <anathema_> ActionParsnip, is that a kind of restricted drivers?
[11:14] <nearst> anathema_, drivers?
[11:14] <lhavelund> hexabit: It isn't. Men det ár

[11:16] <iceroot> kunji1: The -i (simulate initial login) option runs the shell specified by the password database entry of the target user as a login shell.
[11:16] <iceroot> kunji1: it will create the env because its a initial login
[11:16] <iceroot> kunji1: This means that login-specific resource files such as .profile or .login will be read by the shell
[11:16] <iceroot> kunji1: also see "man sudo"
[11:17] <kunji1> iceroot: yeah, I just finished reading the man page entry for it
[11:18] <kunji1> iceroot: that's the man page I was talking about
[11:18] <kunji1> Regardless, I almost always use sudo, was only using sudo su for that folder traversal issue, I'm not adverse to using sudo -i, I just wanted to actually know the rationale, ^_^
[11:19] <iceroot> kunji1: folder traversal issue?
[11:19] <iceroot> kunji1: you mean because after that you are in a different directory?
[11:19] <x-os_pal> dr_willis: this is funny...changed the 'mplayer executable' field in smplayers general options from 'mplayer' to '/usr/bin/mplayer' then video was perfect. then changed the audio output driver field to alsa (rather than pulse) and now everything is just fine. ha! ..fun stuff. thanks again for all your support!
[11:22] <kunji1> iceroot: No, I mean, there are folders you need root access to cd to, but sudo cd does not work.
[11:22] <Hell_Fire> cd is a bash internal
[11:22] <woo> hello everybody
[11:23] <Hell_Fire> there's no actual system command called "cd" :) when you "run" cd, you're telling the current copy of bash to change the working directory to another dir
[11:24] <Hell_Fire> if you run "help" from a bash shell, it'll show you the other bash internal commands
[11:24] <meooo> last attempt
[11:24] <kunji1> Hell_Fire: Right, but I need to do that with root level access, so sudo -i is considered the way to roll for that right?
[11:25] <meooo> any gui app for recording month internet data usage ?
[11:25] <meooo> for ubuntu 11.04
[11:25] <Hell_Fire> yeh, sudo -i gives you a bash shell running as root, which you can then do whatever with
[11:25] <ActionParsnip> meooo: natty is no longer supported
[11:25] <MonkeyDust> meooo  first upgrade, then ask again
[11:25] <ActionParsnip> meooo: i recommend a clean install of Precise, it is LTS and supported til April 2017
[11:26] <meooo> i cna't upgrade
[11:26] <Ben64> sure you cna
[11:26] <kunji1> Hell_Fire: Right, and that's what the conversation was about, I used to sudo su, but now that I know about sudo -i, and why it's preferred, ^_^
[11:26] <meooo> no space for it
[11:26] <meooo> and my system is ollllld
[11:26] <ActionParsnip> meooo: clean install Xubuntu 12.04, you'll be fine
[11:26] <kunji1> meooo: Have you tried apt-get clean?
[11:26] <ActionParsnip> meooo: bet my systems are older
[11:27] <Ben64> or bleachbit
[11:27] <MonkeyDust> meooo  and apt-get autoremove
[11:27] <meooo>  i don't want to remove anyting
[11:27] <woo> kujin1, I use " sudo sh" but I break things with it sometimes
[11:27] <ActionParsnip> meooo: natty isn't supported any more and there are no packages for it
[11:27] <schnoodles> Hey what is the best way to install chrome and skype in ubuntu ?
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> schnoodles: there is no single best way
[11:28] <kunji1> meooo: If you have a larger disk you could try ddrescue, to image to that, swap the drives, then upgrade.
[11:28] <ActionParsnip> schnoodles: you can grab the deb files from the websites for both apps. Skype is also in the partner repo. You will need to manually download chrome
[11:28] <midnight_> hi
[11:28] <meooo> why clean install ? why not upgrade ?
[11:28] <Hell_Fire> kunji1: if you look into the manpage for su as well, you'll see that the equivilent for sudo -i would actually be sudo su -, or sudo su -l, the sudo equivilent for sudo su would be sudo -E bash, but I really wouldn't recommend it, it keeps all your environment the same, so HOME is still set to the users home dir, and because of that, when you're in "~", you're not in /root, but in /home/username :P gets a little funky
[11:29] <MonkeyDust> meooo  clean install is faster and more efficient
[11:29] <kunji1> Might it be possible to store files downloaded for upgrading on external media?
[11:29] <ActionParsnip> meooo: because it installs the OS as it is supposed to be installed. You will also need t upgrade to Oneiric then to Precise.
[11:29] <meooo> then i will need to re install all the apps
[11:29] <ActionParsnip> meooo: indeed. You can restore user data from your backups
[11:30] <iceroot> kunji1: and for something like that you have "sudo -i" its the same problem as "echo "true" > /proc/foobar"  only the first command is running as root but not the next steps the command is doing
[11:30] <kunji1> Hell_Fire: Thanks
[11:30] <MonkeyDust> meooo  first make list of the installed programs, so you can apt-get install them after the upgrade
[11:30] <ActionParsnip> kunji1: you can get around it with:  echo "true" | sudo tee /proc/foobar
[11:31] <kunji1> iceroot: Thanks as well ^_^
[11:31] <meooo> i'm afraid after doing that the tv tuner will fail to work
[11:31] <iceroot> kunji1: no problem, you are welcome

[11:31] <ActionParsnip> meooo: then you have 2 choices. Stay and have no support or any upgrades at all, or upgrade and get support
[11:31] <kunji1> ActionParsnip: and you too :P.
[11:32] <Ben64> it's not likely that a device that works in 11.04 will stop working in 12.04
[11:32] <kunji1> meooo: If you can, make a backup, then go for the clean install.
[11:32] <MonkeyDust> meooo  it's best to not reject or refuse every and any advice you're getting here
[11:32] <ActionParsnip> kunji1: to add to a file, use:  | sudo tee -a /proc/foobar    the -a means (a)dd :)
[11:33] <meooo> ubuntu tv tuner support is very poor
[11:33] <meooo> need a lot of work to get it work
[11:33] <Ben64> which tuner
[11:33] <MonkeyDust> meooo  maybe it's easier after you upgraded
[11:33] <meooo> philiops turner
[11:33] <ActionParsnip> meooo: depends on the chip. Ive had them work out of the box
[11:33] <Ben64> need a model number
[11:33] <kunji1> I do have a wireless adapter I might need to put back to 11.10... never did get my tuner to work, but I haven't tried since 9.10.
[11:34] <Ben64> my tv tuner works great, but its one designed for linux :)
[11:35] <MonkeyDust> Ben64  you're a linux-geek
[11:35] <meooo> Philips SAA7130
[11:35] <Ben64> MonkeyDust: you say that like its bad
[11:35] <kunji1> Ben64: Which one is it?
[11:35] <ActionParsnip> meooo: try the 12.04 liveCD and see if the device works
[11:36] <MonkeyDust> meooo  if you can download programs, then you can download the 12.04 iso
[11:36] <Ben64> kunji1: pchdtv hd-5500
[11:36] <kunji1> Ben64: Thanks
[11:37] <Ben64> i have it hooked up for OTA hdtv, works perfectly with mythtv on ubuntu
[11:38] <Ben64> meooo: looks like it works with a bit of configuring in 12.04
[11:38] <Eagleman> I am looking for a script that runs fetchmail at an succesfull imap login
[11:39] <MonkeyDust> Eagleman  better ask in #bash
[11:39] <stephini> ok every guide says to install themes to ~/.themes... but no such folder seems to exist... >.<
[11:40] <Ben64> stephini: then make it :)
[11:40] <MonkeyDust> stephini  mkdir ~/.themes to create it
[11:41] <meooo> ok
[11:41] <midnight_> Hi, i've seen the ubuntu phone video. Is there a sort of simulator around ?
[11:41] <stephini> theme download still only has the 4 defaults in it.
[11:41] <stephini> theme dropdown*
[11:42] <ActionParsnip> midnight_: try in #ubuntu-phone
[11:43] <midnight_> thanks ActionParsnip
=== jamesm is now known as Guest14670

[11:48] <Brittany> Hey everyone. Just curious, using an ubuntu 12.10 64b distribution, I've noticed that the few games I play are rather slow in frame rate on my AMD 6870 card. I'm not sure why this may be, but it's almost as though there's no GPU acceleration, anyone have any idea what I can do?
[11:49] <midnight_> try to use the accelerated graphics driver
[11:49] <ActionParsnip> Brittany: did you install the proprietary video driver/
[11:50] <midnight_> @Brittany: install first linux-headers
[11:50] <midnight_> @Brittany and then fglrx package
[11:50] <Theodore> hello
[11:50] <ActionParsnip> hi Theodore
[11:50] <Theodore> what is the best app to network two ubuntu os's ?
[11:50] <Theodore> to view each others desktops?
[11:50] <dr_willis> Theodore:  the term network is a little vague in that ussage. ;)
[11:50] <Kartagis> vinagre
[11:51] <dr_willis> Theodore:  shared desktops. gnome has vino/vinigre built in
[11:51] <dr_willis> Theodore:  check out synergy if you can see each pcs monitor also from the same location
[11:51] <dr_willis> Theodore:  and learn about ssh and its X forwarding feature
[11:51] <Brittany> ActionParsnip : I haven't. Any idea where I'd grab that?
[11:51] <Brittany> midnight_ : Thanks I'll give that a go.
[11:52] <ActionParsnip> !ati | Brittany
[11:52] <ubottu> Brittany: For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto
[11:52] <stephini> welp still just the 4 defaults... >.<
[11:52] <Brittany> Cheers.
[11:52] <MonkeyDust> Theodore  i've used teamviever between linux-host and linux in virtualbox, for testing puproses
[11:52] <midnight_> @brittany: ive a ati radeon 7970 . use apt-get install linux-headers and then apt-get install fglrx .. then reboot pc
[11:52] <Brittany> Haha , matrox, woow.
[11:53] <Brittany> linux-headers --- generic package or a certain distro?
[11:53] <ActionParsnip> old skool
[11:53] <midnight_> headers for your kernel version
[11:53] <Ben64> Brittany: depends on your kernel
[11:53] <ActionParsnip> Brittany: linux-headers-generic if memory serves
[11:53] <Theodore> MonkeyDust, how did you get teamviewer to install on ubuntu 13.04?
[11:53] <Ben64> ActionParsnip: only if she's on generic kernel
[11:53] <midnight_> headers are need to recompile the module kernel
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> Theodore: ask in #ubuntu+1 for prerelease support
[11:54] <Ben64> i installed a 32 bit system recently, and it uses -generic-pae, so you can't just trust -generic to work
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> Brittany: i believe the headers will be pulled in as deps
[11:54] <Brittany> I am on  generic kernel.
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: true
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> Brittany: what is the output of:  uname -r
[11:54] <Brittany> 3.5.0.-21-generic
[11:54] <Brittany> minus the period after the 0.
[11:54] <ActionParsnip> Brittany: sudo apt-get install linux-headers-generic
[11:55] <midnight_> so try to launch sudo apt-get install linux-headers
[11:55] <Ben64> there's got to be an easy way
[11:55] <midnight_> you should see a list of valid package
[11:55] <ActionParsnip> !info  linux-headers-generic
[11:55] <ubottu> linux-headers-generic (source: linux-meta): Generic Linux kernel headers. In component main, is optional. Version 3.5.0.21.27 (quantal), package size 2 kB, installed size 32 kB
[11:55] <Brittany> mymy.. fglrx is quite large.
[11:55] <midnight_> eh yep
[11:55] <Brittany> might as well go make some food whilst on this line.
[11:56] <ActionParsnip> Brittany: its a video driver, its largish in windows too
[11:56] <Ben64> sudo apt-get install linux-headers`uname -r | sed s/^.*\-/-/g`
[11:56] <Ben64> there, that should work on every system
[11:56] <Ben64> :D
[11:56] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: showoff :)
[11:57] <Ben64> oh wait, i think it might mess up on pae...
[11:58] <Ben64> sudo apt-get install linux-headers`uname -r | sed s/^.*[0-9]\-/-/g`
[11:58] <Ben64> fixed
[12:02] <dtruby> I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 and I did a system update yesterday. Since this update my lxc containers won't boot, they just hang with some mount errors. Anyone know how to fix this?
[12:03] <Brittany> ActionParsnip : Shall I reboot before doing the binarydriverhowto?
[12:03] <ActionParsnip> Brittany: i would
[12:04] <Brittany> cheers.
[12:08] <MonkeyDust> dtruby  some 70 people in the channel #lxcontainers
[12:08] <dtruby> MonkeyDust: Ok, I'll try asking there. Seemed like an ubuntu specific problem to me though, since it was working before the update

[12:13] <woo> ActionParsnip: bobweaver: I'll try
[12:13] <bobweaver> woo,  when you say that when unity tries to load it does not does this mean that you get to login screen and sign in and it just goes black ?

[12:14] <bobweaver> woo,  also with what ActionParsnip  and MonkeyDust  said can you wnter in to terminal  /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p     is it all yes's ?
[12:14] <MonkeyDust> !uefi | a111 start here

[12:18] <stanman246> hi anyone any knowledge on nfsen?
[12:19] <woo> it has been installed idk where it could have gone
[12:20] <bobweaver> woo,  maybe when you removed a part of compiz it also removed unity 3d
[12:20] <woo> aight reboot time
[12:21] <user___> hello.  help me please with data recower. I get this messsage from testdisk http://storage5.static.itmages.ru/i/13/0116/h_1358338567_7561878_e4293fe9ff.png

[12:23] <woo> bobweaver, with compiz extras
[12:23] <woo> bobweaver, tried to just remove what I had added
[12:23] <woo> bobweaver, messed that all up
[12:24] <bobweaver> woo,  you can see what unity needs with command   apt-cache show unity |awk '/Depends:/,/Recommends:/'
[12:25] <bobweaver> woo,  or better yet   apt-cache show unity |awk '/Depends:/,/Recommends:/'|sed 's|\,|\n|g'
[12:26] <woo> bobweaver, nice script! ya I still have compiz.  never completely deleted it
[12:27] <woo> bobweaver, unity vanished after I had reinstalled
[12:27] <bobweaver> woo,  what do you mean "vanished"
[12:27] <bobweaver> like it crashed ?
[12:28] <woo> bobweaver, the download was strange.  apt-get said I didn't have unity installed.  also said it was like a 3,700kb (if I remember) size download.  It happened in a few seconds.
[12:30] <bobweaver> woo,  you can see what version and if there is new versions read to install with command    apt-cache policy <name of thing>   like apt-cache policy unity
[12:30] <ActionParsnip> woo: what is the output of: sudo lshw -C display | pastebinit

[12:54] <adamk> jacklk: Sure.
[12:54] <OerHeks> jacklk, sure, you can buy minecraft in softwarecentre
[12:54] <dAnjou> UbuntuWarrior: uuh, i can quote it?
[12:54] <bobweaver> luca__,  that version is newer then mine but seems to work fine with mine.  can you tell us what happens after you try to add accounts ?
[12:55] <dAnjou> UbuntuWarrior: section "Einen System-Benutzer einrichten"
[12:55] <dAnjou> first sentence: Wird  adduser  ohne  die Option --system und ...
[12:55] <dAnjou> should be: *mit* der Option
[12:55] <bobweaver> dAnjou,  is this your 1st bug ?
[12:55] <MonkeyDust> asilhouette1  not a clue, sorry
[12:55] <UbuntuWarrior> ok hab schon verstanden danke :D
[12:56] <dAnjou> bobweaver: well, not really. i reported other bugs in other projects. but since this is in a translation, i didn't know where to go.
[12:57] <luca__> ok. the online account is added good, but when i open empathy its like this http://imagebin.org/243094
[12:57] <luca__> if i click on connect, nothing happen
[12:57] <jacklk> Name of the MATE package in Ubu?
[12:58] <bobweaver> dAnjou,  after entering in ubuntu-bug <name of package>  it will take you to launchpad where you enter what is goinng on it then searchs launch pad to see if it is double if not file it. that is it :)
[12:58] <bobweaver> luca__,  I am stupid american can not read that
[12:58] <asilhouette1> !temp
[12:58] <dAnjou> bobweaver: it's on a server, so i guess i can't use that
[12:59] <dAnjou> i'll just do it on my desktop -.-"

[12:59] <MonkeyDust> jacklk  mate is a mint thingy, i guess
[12:59] <bobweaver> dAnjou,  thanks for making Ubuntu better by filing a bug !
[12:59] <jacklk> MonkeyDust: Really?
[12:59] <dAnjou> bobweaver: lol, no problem man :D
[13:00] <jacklk> I thought is was a seperate GUI
=== Err404NotFound is now known as Error404NotFound
[13:00] <dAnjou> i'm an advanced user (using it for >5 years now)
[13:00] <luca__> it simply said to go online to see my contacts, but if a click on disponible in the notification  center, nothing happen
[13:00] <luca__> my empathy is always offline
[13:00] <thec4ke> mate is basically gnome 2
[13:00] <polygons_> hey guys, i have a 5 year old laptop with a 160gb laptop.  i've been a linux user for 15 years, but i need windows for work.  so i want to dual boot.  how would you partition with win8 and xubuntu?  thanks!
[13:00] <jacklk> thec4ke: That's why I want to install it.
[13:00] <thec4ke> dunno if its in the ubuntu repos but source is available and there are tons of binary packages online
[13:01] <Eagleman> Are there commands to give the group owner of a file the same permissions as the user owner ?
[13:01] <luca__> i've already tried pidgin, but it doesn't work well
[13:01] <MonkeyDust> jacklk  thec4ke it *looks* like gnome2, but it is gnome3
[13:01] <luca__> there's nothing to do?
[13:01] <thec4ke> MonkeyDust: youre thinking of cinnamon
[13:01] <thec4ke> mate is gnome2 based
[13:01] <jacklk> yah
[13:01] <bobweaver> polygons_,  I would bootlive cd then make a partition for windows to install to with gparted. then install windows to that. Just one way though
[13:02] <jrib> Eagleman: you mean to copy the user permissions automatically to the group?
[13:02] <jacklk> Can MATE be installed on Ubuntu?
[13:02] <k5673> !dualboot
[13:02] <Eagleman> yes jrib

[13:02] <k5673> !dualboot | polygons_
[13:02] <ubottu> polygons_: please see above
[13:02] <polygons_> bobweaver, thanks ,i'm thinking of 130 win8 and then 2 swap and 28 xubuntu.  i can use the big win8 partition to store files.
[13:02] <philinux> polygons_: I would use virtualbox
[13:02] <jacklk> So Ubuntu has no support for Gnome 2 and MATE the best DEs ever>
[13:02] <jacklk> ?
[13:03] <thec4ke> jacklk: http://mate-desktop.org/install/
[13:03] <Eagleman> jrib, i got like 500 files, i cant do everything mannually
[13:03] <polygons_> philinux, my computer is too crappy for that :)
[13:03] <bobweaver> philinux,  +1 if you have the ram
[13:03] <thec4ke> you add the mate repo then sudo apt-get install
[13:03] <OerHeks> jacklk, ubuntu does not support mate, join the mint channel
[13:04] <jrib> Eagleman: you want different permissions on 500 files?  You don't just want g=rwx or g=rw?
[13:04] <thec4ke> mate isnt mint specific
[13:04] <thec4ke> it was actually conceived by an arch user
[13:04] <jarlath> Shutting down 12.04 takes me to the greeter. I have tests, bootcharts etc. Anyone guess what's going on? http://askubuntu.com/questions/243630/shut-down-takes-me-to-greeter-now#comment301883_243630
[13:04] <Eagleman> jrib, i want the exact same user permissions on the group permissions
[13:05] <Eagleman> each file could have different permissions on them
[13:05] <philinux> jacklk: http://www.noobslab.com/2012/11/install-mate-14-desktop-in-ubuntu.html
[13:05] <jrib> Eagleman: you're going to have to script it, but honestly the possibilities are so few that it will be easier to just use find for each possibility that does actually show up (I'd be surprised if it's more than 2) and then use chmod on that group
[13:05] <ActionParsnip> jarlath: if you run:   sudo shutdown -h now     does it die?
[13:05] <philinux> jacklk: loads of other links from an "ubuntu mate" search
[13:06] <jrib> Eagleman: can I ask why you want to do this by the way?
[13:06] <midnight> hello, i've an amd fx 8350 on my ubuntu box and i've noticied a very high temperature on the CPU. I've also activate cool'n' quiet but the temperature is over than windows. Is there anything to control the power management?
[13:07] <jrib> Eagleman: hmm, apparently you *can* copy them with: chmod g=u.  See if that works.
[13:07] <Ben64> midnight: how are you seeing the temperature
[13:07] <ActionParsnip> midnight: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[13:07] <Eagleman> jrib, in my apache2 web folder, i have for example this:  -rw-r--r--  1 robin    www-data  2719 Jan 14 23:31 xmlrpc.php   However i want the second r to be replaced with rw
[13:07] <midnight> Ben64: in primis i hear the cpu fan
[13:08] <midnight> Ben64: then i see the value of the bios
[13:08] <Ben64> midnight: you reboot to check temp?
[13:08] <midnight> yes
[13:08] <jrib> Eagleman: ok, but do note that it's a bad idea security-wise to give www-data (presumably the group that your web-server is running as) write permissions on files the web server doesn't actually need to write to
[13:09] <Eagleman> jrib, thats the problem, it needs write permissions on those files. its how they were extracted
[13:09] <Ben64> midnight: unless the temperature causes a shutdown, you shouldn't worry abou it
[13:09] <polygons_> geez, sorry i got kicked out.  what do you guys think of 130 win8 and then 30 ubuntu and using win8 to store docuements?
[13:09] <jarlath> ActionParsnip: yes, that works. As does sudo reboot.
[13:09] <jrib> Eagleman: k, just making sure you are aware
[13:09] <ActionParsnip> jarlath: sounds like a permissions thing then
[13:10] <ActionParsnip> midnight: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[13:10] <midnight> ActionParsnip: i cant see now, im in office
[13:10] <philinux> polygons_: you could have a dedcated ntfs data partition
[13:10] <polygons_> philinux, i could, but i'm not sure how big to make the win8 partition, ya know?
[13:11] <ActionParsnip> no worries, if its 12.10 then you may want to try XFCE
[13:11] <philinux> polygons_: no idea. someone else might
[13:11] <polygons_> philinux, but if i use win8 to store files, then i don't haev to know?  how big should i make hte xubuntu partition?
[13:12] <jarlath> ActionParsnip: Okay, I don't know a lot about the shutdown process. I've changed permissions on a shared partition but nothing on the root filesystem. Any idea where I should be poking around?
[13:12] <polygons_> philinux: i was thinking 30 gigs?
[13:12] <ActionParsnip> polygons_: 30gb for for / is plenty :)
[13:13] <ActionParsnip> jarlath: not sure, I suggest you report a bug. State that the sudo thing works
[13:13] <philinux> polygons_: if ubuntu is not used to store files then 10 gigs would do.  my root is only showing 4 gig out of 10 used
[13:13] <philinux> after 2 years running
[13:13] <polygons_> ActionParsnip: philinux  thanks!  can i mount the home directory inside of a windows partition?  wierd eh?
[13:13] <philinux> polygons_: and I remove old kernels
[13:14] <philinux> no
[13:14] <polygons_> philinux: wow, that's really tight!
[13:14] <Eagleman> jrib:  chmod g+u file
[13:14] <jacklk> polygons_: That's what she said.
[13:14] <jrib> Eagleman: no, g=u
[13:14] <polygons_> ActionParsnip: philinux: is ubuntu bigger and slower than xubuntu in reality?
[13:14] <polygons_> jacklk: lol

[13:15] <Eagleman> jrib why = ?

[13:18] <AndChat|296121> Samsung note
[13:18] <AndChat|296121> I have put ubuntu on it
[13:18] <ActionParsnip> polygons_: or, have an entirely separate partition for casual data which both OSes use, maks backups easier too

[14:40] <jirido> Hi. is there some program to make an installer from a installed copy of ubuntu with all manually installed programs so one can use virtual box to install everything in beforehand before installing to disk?

[14:48] <Cajun_Lan_Man> Hello Everyone. I'm looking to run RAID1 on a Dell desktop for cheap disk based backup. If I turn on onboard RAID on the Dell, is there any for me to monitor the RAID health in Ubuntu? Intel has software for doing it in Windows, but I was hoping to use Ubuntu for the OS. Any suggestions?
[14:49] <vitimiti> salut
[14:49] <Eagleman> jrib, everything i ask something, i get new suggestions, i work them out, and next time i ask something that looks like the previous question, they suggest something new ( and sometimes better ). And there i am rebuilding everything
[14:49] <jrib> Eagleman: you should just state what you want to accomplish then :)
[14:50] <Eagleman> Should i use su - user  -c "fetchmail -d 60"   OR   su - user  -c "/usr/bin/fetchmail -d 60"  in rc.local?
[14:50] <jrib> Eagleman: well, what's the difference between the two commands?
[14:51] <skylio>  y a il un bon serveur ou pas ?
[14:51] <Eagleman> jrib sometimes you have to include the location of the command to be able to use it. But i dont know if i have to do this now, i am a bit noob on bash enviroments
[14:52] <jrib> Eagleman: it depends on whether /usr/bin is in PATH or not.  You can just play it safe and give the full path if you're not sure (that's what I would do).  But like I said, I suggest just using crontab instead

[15:11] <navetz> hello i need some help with my nvida drivers. I just installed ubuntu and have a gforce 560m graphics card. I did my software updates then switched to nvidia propritiary drivers but the display broke
[15:11] <navetz> is it possible that the nvidia drivers don't work with the new kernel I upgraded to?
[15:12] <BluesKaj> navetz, how did you upgrade to the new kernel , and which kernel ?
[15:12] <bibi23> There is something I don't understand about cronjobs and PATH, I have added a dir to $PATH in my  /home/user/.bashrc file, scripts inside are accessible from anywhere, but when I run a cronjob it says it cannot find them, do you know why?
[15:12] <testjtjt> TorbenBeta: that is very strange ... try downloading it and installing it from here
[15:13] <navetz> BluesKaj: I did it through the software centre. I don't know what one, I would assume whatever the newest one in the ubuntu repos is
[15:13] <testjtjt> TorbenBeta:  http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/libjpeg-turbo8 ( install it with sudo dpkg -i <PACKAGE_NAME>
[15:13] <jsmonkey_> can anyone recommend a software to fix so that my dynamic ip is mapped to a domain?
[15:13] <navetz> BluesKaj: is there a way I can find out which kernel I'm on?
[15:13] <Traumatizer> I probably don´t know the awnser to your question navetz. But I think it´d help if you tell us what driver you are using. You can find this out by using the lspci command.
[15:13] <testjtjt> jsmonkey_: http://no-ip.org
[15:13] <navetz> Traumatizer: I was using nvidia-current. I'll check lspci
[15:13] <crankharder> I increased the disk size of a VM, restarted it, but now I need to "resize the partitions and LVM structure within it normally" -- I guess that's done from within ubuntu.  how do I do that?  ubuntu-server 12.04 here

[15:18] <testjtjt> TorbenBeta: you could try to install it on the old ubuntu, but there will be problems
[15:18] <navetz> BluesKaj: I switched to the nvidia drivers, then when I rebooted the login screen was in low resolution. I typed in my password and only got a background of ubuntu and nothing else. When I typed things I could see them show up in a box on the bottom right but I couldn't do anything else. I went back to open source drivers but I would like to get 3d acceleration working
[15:19] <TorbenBeta> testjtjt, nah, I will stay with 11.10 as long as I can.
[15:20] <Sail> ok so i fresh install ubuntu12.10 after installing i install gnome-panel now my question how to make gnome default login?

[15:20] <midnight> first
[15:21] <midnight> navetz: it happens either with amd, and with nvidia
[15:21] <navetz> midnight: which headers do I need ot install?

[15:26] <navetz> midnight: i'm installing 21-generic right now
[15:26] <navetz> midnight: why do I need to install these headers? I thought I already had them
[15:26] <midnight> and after install the nvidia driver again
[15:26] <Traumatizer> How can ubuntu be so small. The iso is only 753 Mb, the one for windows 7 is like 1.5gb
[15:26] <navetz> midnight: okay
[15:26] <midnight> either amd and nvidia recompile the kernel module
[15:27] <navetz> midnight: okay headers are installed, now i'll install nvidia
[15:27] <midnight> yes
[15:27] <midnight> and the reboot
[15:27] <midnight> *then

[15:34] <jsmonkey_> llutz: I am completly new when it comes to these terms (I am "just" a developer). What is cname and will that solution work if I already have purchased a domain elsewhere and just want to map my dynamic ip to it?

[15:35] <navetz> thanks a lot for the help guys
[15:35] <navetz> if there is a software update for new linux headers, should I not update because they might break nvidia?
[15:35] <ikonia> navetz: they are only used at compile time
[15:35] <llutz> jsmonkey_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record  and yes it will work in most cases. it fails with MX-records etc. but you don't want those with dyn-ip
[15:36] <navetz> ikonia: oh okay
[15:36] <navetz> ikonia: thanks

[15:41] <llutz> jsmonkey_: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System     register a free-dyndns host, lets say "myhost.zapto.org" at no-ip.com, then you create a new entry in the dns-settings of your own domain "www.yourdomain.com  cname myhost.zapto.org"   and with this, your computer will be reachable as "www.yourdomain.com" from internet. this might work with web-access/ssh etc. but not with email

[16:02] <usr13> skribblezatcha: yes
[16:03] <skribblezatcha> cool usr..thanks..
[16:04] <skribblezatcha> i just installed wine in mint14 KDE..and was wondering if i just download and install the windows program that i want to run..or is there a process about doing so that i need to know about?
[16:04] <MonkeyDust> !mint
[16:04] <ubottu> Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[16:04] <usr13> skribblezatcha: Just install the windows programs
[16:05] <skribblezatcha> ok thanks usr..will do.
[16:05] <OerHeks> skribblezatcha, as usr13 says, and you might want to check the wineHQ database for tips
[16:05] <skribblezatcha> if it messes things up i wll just do a fresh install of mint and start over again.
[16:05] <circle> Who here uses Unity?
[16:05] <skribblezatcha> ok cool..thanks OerHeks.
[16:05] <usr13> skribblezatcha: But what do you need? (Most all of the windows programs will just be a redundancy.)
[16:06] <skribblezatcha> its yazak chat client to be exact.
[16:06] <k1l_> circle: we dont do surveys here
[16:06] <usr13> skribblezatcha: We have several. (I use irssi.)
[16:06] <skribblezatcha> i accidentally wiped out windows..lol so i am used to chatting with a few yahoo heads in a room there..
[16:07] <usr13> skribblezatcha: IRC?
[16:07] <skribblezatcha> well i am on pidgin..which is what i prefer usr13..even on windows i used pidgin..so i am good. although pidgin cant go into the yazserv rooms.
[16:07] <BluesKaj> yahoo heads ? ...strange
[16:07] <skribblezatcha> no..its anothr protocol..
[16:08] <usr13> skribblezatcha: Not IRC?
[16:08] <skribblezatcha> not really BluesKaj..if you are me its home.;)
[16:08] <skribblezatcha> no..its not IRC usr13..
[16:08] <usr13> skribblezatcha: Not Yahoo IM?
[16:08] <usr13> skribblezatcha: Ok, well I don't know what it is.  Sorry, my comments are irrelevant
[16:08] <skribblezatcha> no..its a yahoo chat client. the writer of the client started his own server where we created rooms as yahoo refugees once yahoo chatrooms closed down.
[16:09] <skribblezatcha> so if i can get it to run in linux mint..it would be cool..
[16:09] <k1l_> skribblezatcha: like mentioned before. for mint ask the mint support
[16:10] <skribblezatcha> thats the point..forget the protocol. its a windows app that i would like to get to run using wine. if i need to pull wine up..or direct the installation to wine or something i need to know that.
[16:10] <skribblezatcha> see what i mean?
[16:10] <Cajun_Lan_Man> escott: Thanks for the links.
[16:10] <skribblezatcha> or do i simply install..wine being a platform that has installed the necessary dlls for me to run a windows program natively?
[16:11] <escott> Cajun_Lan_Man, avoid at all costs that intel raid junk
[16:11] <k1l_> !mint | skribblezatcha ask the mint guys
[16:11] <ubottu> skribblezatcha ask the mint guys: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[16:11] <skribblezatcha> thats what i am wondering..if wine is kinda like a VM type of thing..or has installed iteself within the OS to allow me to run a windows app.
[16:12] <MonkeyDust> skribblezatcha  wine is a layer
[16:12] <usr13> skribblezatcha: Are you sure pigin won't do it?
[16:12] <skribblezatcha> there is no such channel ubottu..
[16:12] <escott> skribblezatcha, it translate win32 API calls to POSIX calls. Wine Is Not an Emulator
[16:13] <skribblezatcha> ok..cool. so i should simply install yazak and see if it runs then. good deal. if i have issues i will reinstall mint and start over again. thanks all.;)
[16:13] <usr13> skribblezatcha: Noone sait there was, ( a ubottu channel ).
[16:13] <k1l_> skribblezatcha: read the message again. its another network, not freenode. if you have problems to connect get in touch with their support forums or other things mentioned on their side
[16:13] <skribblezatcha> dope sense of humor there usr13.
[16:13] <usr13> skribblezatcha: Why would you re0install mint?
[16:14] <usr13> ok
[16:14] <dalsgaard> Hello guys. I want to remove the "alt+RMB" drags window function, but when I do it in dconf-editor, it's like it inverted the key. So all of a sudden I have to hold down ALT to click regularly
[16:14] <skribblezatcha> to eliminate wine if it doesnt help me out usr13.
[16:14] <dalsgaard> Anyone had that oddball issue?
[16:14] <skribblezatcha> no need for it in the pc if it wont help me out.
[16:15] <dalsgaard> emulator
[16:15] <skribblezatcha> mint is actually ubuntu based..although i guess that i heard they have a debian version..hence me showing up here thinking that heads could help me out. its cool though..
[16:15] <skribblezatcha> i am used to getting the run around.
[16:15] <dalsgaard> You guys need a bot to trigger when you write the word "Emulator" :P
[16:16] <soee> are there any tool that might help to calibrate monitor ?
[16:16] <enapupe> Hi There, I'm looking for a way to output a local video to /dev/video0 (webcam), any ways?
[16:17] <OerHeks> enapupe, output a video to a webcam ?
[16:17] <usr13> enapupe: Depends on what video card you have.  If it's Nvidia, you prolly have a GUI for it.  If not you may need to just use xrandr.
[16:17] <enapupe> I mean, output some AVI video I have here, onto /dev/video0
[16:18] <usr13> enapupe: What?  Can you elaborate on that just a bit?
[16:18] <OerHeks> enapupe, so you want to watch a video om your webcam /dev/video0 ?
[16:18] <k1l_> i think he wants to stream something
[16:18] <enapupe> I don't have a webcam, I want to have a fake output to work with html5 getusermedia
[16:18] <k1l_> i dont think a webcam can output something
[16:19] <enapupe> without having a webcam, I just need some fake output
[16:19] <enapupe> on windows I used this 'fake webcam' software
[16:19] <enapupe> on which I select a video to play 'on' the webcam output

[16:29] <sogeking99> How do I get that thing for Nautilus where you right click a folder and can open it in terminal?
[16:29] <phoenixsampras> help, how to get more information from a package, before installing it ? using APT
[16:29] <MonkeyDust> sogeking99  nautilus-scripts package
[16:30] <TheLordOfTime> phoenixsampras, apt-cache show [package]
[16:30] <TheLordOfTime> phoenixsampras, that'll give you cursory information, what are you specifically looking for in terms of information about a package?
[16:31] <sogeking99> MonkeyDust, the nautilus scripts manager?
[16:32] <MonkeyDust> sogeking99  that's the correct name
=== yann__ is now known as Yann_L1
[16:32] <phoenixsampras> TheLordOfTime: Thank you!!
=== Yann_L1 is now known as YannT
[16:33] <TheLordOfTime> phoenixsampras, you're welcome.
[16:33] <sogeking99> Okay thanks MonkeyDust
[16:35] <Tuxmascot> I keep getting this error in terminal:
[16:35] <Tuxmascot> Failed file save: .//resume.dat.new
[16:35] <Tuxmascot> Unable to save the resume file. Another program might have the file open, or the disk is full.
[16:35] <Tuxmascot> How can I get rid of it?
[16:35] <sogeking99> MonkeyDust, I have the manager open but I don't see a way to add th eopen in terminal option?
[16:36] <j`ey> is there a way to install newer packages on an older system?
[16:36] <j`ey> I need a newer gdb than 10.04 has
[16:36] <escott> j`ey, then upgrade your OS
[16:36] <TheLordOfTime> j`ey, upgrade to 12.04?
[16:36] <TheLordOfTime> (which is an LTS)
[16:36] <MonkeyDust> sogeking99  looking, moment...
[16:37] <j`ey> without upgrading
[16:37] <escott> j`ey, compile it yourslef
[16:37] <MonkeyDust> sogeking99  my mistake, apologies, it's nautilus-open-terminal
[16:38] <j`ey> escott: ok
[16:38] <sogeking99> Okay thanks again
[16:38] <TheLordOfTime> j`ey, install build deps and compile yourself.
[16:38] <TheLordOfTime> j`ey, but i think gdb requires newer versions of build-deps, so it may not work
[16:38] <jakepiano> hey i'm back again with another problem. when i tried dualbooting ubuntu and windows and letting it do its thing, i found that a lot of the drivers for windows were missing and i had no way to install it. for instance, the network driver was gone and i had no way to connect to the internet in any way.
[16:39] <TheLordOfTime> j`ey, and if that's the case, you're stuck at needing to upgrade your OS (probably to 12.04)
[16:39] <TheLordOfTime> (since the rdeps may break other things.
[16:39] <j`ey> 04 or 10 is LTS?
[16:39] <TheLordOfTime> )
[16:39] <TheLordOfTime> j`ey, 12.04 is LTS
[16:39] <j`ey> ok
[16:39] <TheLordOfTime> just like 10.04 is LTS
[16:39] <shade34321> how do I check to see what file started a process?
[16:39] <MonkeyDust> jakepiano  better ask in ##windows
[16:39] <j`ey> maybe Ill look into upgrading
[16:39] <j`ey> was just wondering if there was a quick fix for now
[16:40] <goudkov> hi guys. i just installed 12.04, copied my ttf windows fonts into ~/.fonts and ran fc-cache, but firefox still seems to be using the default fonts. is there some place else i need to look at?
[16:40] <escott> shade34321, pstree?
[16:40] <jakepiano> oh oop you're right. wrong question. my question for #ubuntu is how to partition half of my 500 gb hard drive for it manually. is it ext2 or ext4 and linux swap and how big?
[16:40] <TheLordOfTime> j`ey, your first step is to try and compile it from source.
[16:41] <TheLordOfTime> j`ey, but if it FTBFS (Fails to build from source), then you may have to upgrade.
[16:41] <MonkeyDust> !partitions > jakepiano read this to get an idea
[16:41] <ubottu> jakepiano, please see my private message
[16:41] <jakepiano> ubottu yes i did
[16:41] <ubottu> jakepiano: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[16:43] <MonkeyDust> jakepiano  I have 15GB for / and the rest for /home    swap is about my ram size + a bit extra
[16:43] <ehlu> How do i restore all the default home folders?
[16:43] <MonkeyDust> jakepiano  (telling you as example)
[16:43] <ehlu> Like pictures etc.
=== atrius_away is now known as atrius
[16:44] <usr13> ehlu: What do you mean restore?  Did you delete them?
[16:44] <jakepiano> MonkeyDust, so if i were to dual boot with windows, what should the sizes and types for these partions be? For example, i'm thinking of just starting with half my hard drive, 250/250. with that, what other partitions does the ubuntu part need?
[16:45] <usr13> elky: mkdir Pictures ?
[16:46] <usr13> ehlu: mkdir Pictures Documents etc..?
[16:46] <MonkeyDust> jakepiano  sounds similar to what i have, i suggest you do the same
[16:46] <ehlu> with correct emblems etc
[16:47] <usr13> ehlu: What are correct emblems?
[16:47] <jakepiano> yes, but what else does ubuntu need? i've tried to install with just an ext2 partition but it didn't work, it says i need to add more. what are those partitions?
[16:47] <usr13> ehlu: They are just directories
[16:47] <MonkeyDust> jakepiano  ext4 is the most common
[16:48] <funkt> Hi there really small problem I keep getting my hidden files showing all the time even after I untick show hidden files it always seems to keep showing them in 12.04 anyone have any ideas?
[16:48] <usr13> ehlu: Just open a terminal and do:  mkdir Pictures Documents Music Videos
[16:49] <usr13> ehlu: That's it....
[16:49] <jakepiano> MonkeyDust, does that partition need anything else?
[16:49] <shade34321> escott, sorry for the late reply...thanks
[16:49] <MonkeyDust> jakepiano  like what?
[16:50] <jakepiano> like a linux swap or something?
[16:50] <MonkeyDust> jakepiano  yes, swap too
[16:50] <usr13> jakepiano: Yes, create a swap partition too.
[16:51] <usr13> jakepiano: Are you asking for recommendations?
[16:51] <jakepiano> alright, what are the specifics on that?
[16:51] <usr13> jakepiano: 8G for swap, 30G for /   the rest for /home
[16:52] <usr13> jakepiano: something like that ^^
[16:52] <tom22r> hello
[16:52] <jakepiano> usr13, recommendation for, say, a 100g partition?
[16:52] <Axio`> Hi, I want to do: "cat file  | grep blabla". Problem. It says: "grep : commande introuvable" (translation: can't find the command)
[16:52] <usr13> jakepiano: 8G for swap, 30G for /   the rest for /home
[16:53] <tom22r> in windows 8 with the metro gui I can write apps with javascript, is this possible with a linux gui (unity, gnome etc.) ?
[16:53] <jrib> Axio`: where are you doing this?
[16:53] <Axio`> jrib: terminal
[16:53] <jrib> Axio`: pastebin the output of « env »
[16:54] <MonkeyDust> tom22r  start here http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/
[16:54] <jakepiano> alright thanks
[16:54] <Axio`> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1538094/
[16:54] <Axio`> jrib: It is weird, I have just done: env | pastebinit. It worked. I want to pastebinit something else, but it says command not found
[16:55] <usr13> jakepiano: You can just do swap and /  if you want.   8g swap, rest for /  (but I recoommend /home/ too.)
[16:55] <tom22r> @MonkeyDust thanks
[16:56] <jrib> Axio`: yes, that's weird.  What happens when you run « /bin/grep » ?
[16:56] <tom22r> but is the answer to my question yes or no?
[16:56] <Axio`> jrib: Usage: /bin/grep [OPTION]... MOTIF [FICHIER]... Pour en savoir davantage, faites: « /bin/grep --help ».
[16:57] <jrib> Axio`: run « hash -r » and then try your grep command again.  If it errors again, pastebin your command and full output
[16:59] <Axio`> jrib: I run hash -r, still the same with cat file | grep blabla: grep command not found
[16:59] <Axio`> jrib: I don't have any output to pastebin
[16:59] <vagtastic> I got this script that works well from shell. Is there something I can do to make the terminal close while not closing the program?
[16:59] <MonkeyDust> tom22r  ask in #ubuntu-app-devel
[16:59] <jrib> Axio`: but you are pasting (presumably paraphrased things) her.  I'm asking you to pastebin the actual command you ran and the actual output (in full)
[17:00] <jrib> vagtastic: you can... do one of the following: 1) command & disown    2) nohup command    3) screen or tmux
[17:00] <Axio`> jrib: cat /home/xavier/.xbmc/temp/xbmc.log | pastebinit
[17:00] <Axio`>  pastebinit : commande introuvable
[17:00] <vagtastic> Oh yeah its in BASH, awk with some sed .
[17:01] <jrib> Axio`: let's stick to grep
[17:01] <jrib> for now
[17:01] <vagtastic> jrib so you think I should mux the term ? Can I still run the script as su even if I disown it?
[17:02] <jrib> vagtastic: sure.  I don't know exactly what you mean by "run the script as su"
[17:02] <Axio`> jrib: cat file | grep blabla
[17:02] <Axio`>  grep : commande introuvable
[17:02] <jrib> Axio`: now with "/bin/grep" instead of "grep"
[17:03] <tom22r> MonkeyDust: ok
[17:03] <Axio`> jrib: cat file | /bin/grep blabla
[17:03] <Axio`> bash:  /bin/grep: Aucun fichier ou dossier de ce type
[17:03] <Axio`> No file or no folder of that type (quick translation)
[17:03] <vagtastic> jrib I am running debian but sure I can install sudo. No big deal. Done now. So you mean sudo ./myscript.sh -p udp & disown ?
[17:04] <jrib> vagtastic: sure.  Though if you use tmux or screen, then you can reconnect to the process later
[17:04] <vagtastic> jrib sry this vm was indeed Ubuntu and I have sudo installed. I am on the wheel too
[17:05] <jrib> vagtastic: uh, what version of ubuntu?  wheel hasn't been used in a long time...
[17:05] <vagtastic> jrib OK I use tmux for things like irssi and weechat to split my terms up.
[17:05] <jrib> Axio`: what happens when you do: « grep blabla file »
[17:06] <vagtastic> jrib I take it I am on the wheel since I can use super user cmds.
[17:06] <Axio`> jrib: grep blabla file
[17:06] <Axio`> blabla blabla
[17:06] <vagtastic> jrib its 12.04 headless
[17:06] <Cira> This may be the wrong place to ask, but does anyone know where I could get decent free linux shell? Shellmix isn't working nowadays for some reason...
[17:07] <vagtastic> jrib but 90 % of the them I am in Squeeze. GNU/Linux all the same thing. Just some have blobs and GUIs.
[17:07] <jrib> vagtastic: ok, maybe you have a nostalgic sysadmin
[17:07] <vagtastic> jrib that would be me =) Yes I even have a root user account.
[17:08] <jrib> Axio`: you're doing all these things in the same exact terminal, right?
[17:08] <michealPW> Is there a way to manually instruct Ubuntu One clients to sync?
[17:08] <Axio`> jrib: yes
[17:08] <jrib> !ot | Cira
[17:08] <ubottu> Cira: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[17:08] <Cira> sorrz
[17:08] <michealPW> I open up my UbuntuOne for Mac client and it says it's all sync'd, but it's not.. The work I just put in my /Ubuntu One directory is not yet pushed to the server.
[17:09] <vagtastic> So there is no root user in Ubuntu? I mean under /root ?
[17:09] <jrib> vagtastic: there is a root user, the account is just locked by default
[17:09] <jrib> !root
[17:09] <ubottu> Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[17:09] <jrib> Axio`: cat file | LANGUAGE=C LC_ALL=C grep blabla
[17:10] <Axio`> jrib: I just tried with sudo su, "cat file | grep blabla" works fine
[17:10] <vagtastic> jrib but what if you do not have the program sudo installed?
[17:10] <vagtastic> I just installed it
[17:10] <jrib> Axio`: ok, but « sudo -i » is recommended over « sudo su »
[17:10] <Axio`> jrib: cat file | LANGUAGE=C LC_ALL=C grep blabla
[17:10] <Axio`> blabla blabla
[17:10] <jrib> Axio`: this is outside of sudo su?
[17:10] <Axio`> jrib: last one is the output without sudo
[17:10] <jrib> vagtastic: ubuntu comes with sudo and gives sudo access to the first user setup during install
[17:11] <jrib> Axio`: and when you get rid of "LANGUAGE=C LC_ALL=C", you get an error?
[17:11] <vagtastic> @,@ wow GNU/Linux has come a long way since 95 !
[17:11] <Axio`> jrib: huh it works now, without it
[17:11] <jrib> Axio`: this is strange...
[17:12] <Axio`> jrib: nope, I don't know what happened, it worked only once
[17:13] <jrib> Axio`: so what happens now with the language stuff in there?
[17:13] <Axio`> jrib: There is something REALLY weird: xavier@desktop:~$ cat file | grep blabla
[17:13] <Axio`> blabla blabla
[17:13] <Axio`> xavier@desktop:~$ cat file | grep blabla
[17:13] <Axio`>  grep : commande introuvable
[17:13] <michealPW> Is there a channel for Ubuntu One?
[17:13] <vagtastic> Normally I remove old kernels like this "   sudo apt-get remove $(dpkg -l|egrep '^ii  linux-(im|he)'|awk '{print $2}'|grep -v `uname -r`)   "
[17:13] <jrib> Axio`: do other users have access to this system?
[17:13] <vagtastic> Is there a Ubuntu way of doing this?
[17:13] <Axio`> First grep of that log was done by deleting the language stuff from your the previous command I entered, second grep was done by re-writting everything
[17:14] <jrib> vagtastic: maybe with the gui, but not that I know of in the shell
[17:14] <Axio`> jrib: Only me, I have ssh access on it also
[17:14] <jrib> Axio`: haha maybe what you write is not "grep" but some other letters that look like grep
[17:15] <vagtastic> jrib good to know. I am in a Xen based Debian slice what in this case has a slice with Ubuntu on it. All though ssh into a headless server. So yeah I am in a terminal.
[17:16] <Axio`> jrib: that's awful
[17:17] <sardior> Been having a problem with nautilus. When I cut then paste a bunch of files it will copy a few and then hang.
[17:17] <jrib> Axio`: try deleting space before the 'g' as a test.  So try typing: cat file |grep blabla
[17:18] <keko-> Hello. I need some help and i dont know how to solve this problem. So here is what i did: gedit ~ /. xprofile  After this export UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE = 1
=== emile_ is now known as dawkirst_
[17:18] <Axio`> jrib: It works, but now everything is working (grep, pastebinit...)
[17:18] <Axio`> With and without space
[17:18] <sardior> I installed dolphin and it seems to work fine.
[17:18] <Axio`> I don't understand at all
[17:19] <jrib> Axio`: even when I copied your command here with that space, it gave me command not found
[17:19] <keko-> I loged out of my user profile and now i cant login... the password aint leting me in.
[17:19] <Axio`> jrib: Problem seems to be solved, I don't know how
[17:19] <jrib> Axio`: you are producing weird spaces somehow :x
[17:21] <Axio`> Axio`: I don't know, but now it is all fine
[17:21] <keko-> jrib Axio` or anyone else who is maybe here. I need some help and i dont know how to solve this problem. So here is what i did: gedit ~ /. xprofile  After this export UNITY_LOW_GFX_MODE = 1
[17:21] <keko-> I loged out of my user profile and now i cant login... the password aint leting me in.
[17:21] <Axio`> jrib: From the moment I typed this "cat file |grep blabla", I wasn't able to reproduce the problem anymore
[17:21] <sardior> looks like splits and lags. Should I repost my question?
[17:22] <keko-> also i cant open the gedit ~/.xprofile
[17:22] <Axio`> jrib: thanks btw!
[17:22] <Shortstraw8> I'm new to this. I installed lamp according to (http://www.linuxcandy.com/2011/11/how-to-install-lamp-in-ubuntu-1110.html) but when I enter the sudo vi /var/www/info.php and restart I get a 404 error. Any ideas
[17:22] <jrib> Axio`: here try copy and pasting this: cat file | grep blabla
=== ericab_away is now known as ericab
[17:23] <Axio`> jrib: cat file | grep blabla
[17:23] <Axio`>  grep : commande introuvable
[17:23] <jrib> Axio`: see :)
[17:23] <Axio`> I don't get it
[17:23] <jrib> Axio`: that space before the 'g' is not a regular space
[17:24] <sardior> I'll try later...
[17:24] <Axio`> jrib: So I probably copy pasted a command with a weird space which caused the problem?
[17:24] <Axio`> jrib: And to solve it I have to not put a space after "|", right?
[17:24] <jrib> Axio`: ah if you copy and pasted it from somewhere else, that would explain it.  I thought maybe you had a weird setup on your keyboard
[17:26] <Axio`> jrib: That's a bit weird that just copy pasting it one time, breaks all the next commands that wouldn't be copy pasted, no?
[17:27] <jrib> Axio`: yes.  Here you can see there is a difference if you do this: echo " X " | hexdump
[17:28] <Axio`> jrib: I see
[17:28] <drahti> how can i ask becaus xserver problems?
[17:29] <Axio`> jrib: I was too optimistic the problem isn't gone: cat file | grep blabla (I typed everything manually)
[17:29] <Axio`>  grep : commande introuvable
[17:29] <Axio`> xavier@desktop:~$ cat file |grep blabla (I removed the space)
[17:29] <Axio`> blabla blabla
[17:29] <Axio`> xavier@desktop:~$ cat file | grep blabla (I added manually a space)
[17:29] <Axio`> blabla blabla
[17:29] <FloodBot1> Axio`: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[17:29] <jrib> Axio`: do you have deadkeys or something like that in your keyboard layout?
[17:30] <Axio`> jrib: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1538190/
[17:30] <Shortstraw8> I'm new to this. I installed lamp according to (http://www.linuxcandy.com/2011/11/how-to-install-lamp-in-ubuntu-1110.html) but when I enter the sudo vi /var/www/info.php and restart I get a 404 error. Any ideas
[17:31] <Axio`> jrib: I don't think so, how do I check?
[17:32] <Grandpa_smashy> Anyone have any success dual booting win8 and ubuntu?
[17:32] <jrib> Axio`: so your keyboard generates http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/a0/index.htm apparently
[17:32] <jrib> Axio`: hmm, in system settings go to keyboard settings and then layout options
[17:33] <kunji1> Grandpa_smashy: yes, I am
[17:33] <Axio`> jrib: My layout is called: "Français (variante obsolète)" Maybe I should try one that isn't obsolete
[17:33] <Grandpa_smashy> Did you use wubi?
[17:33] <jrib> Axio`: worth a try
[17:33] <kunji1> Grandpa_smashy: nope, not at all
[17:33] <jrib> Axio`: very familiar title here but haven't read through: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3693628?start=15&tstart=0
[17:34] <Grandpa_smashy> Got any good walkthurs u know of... im terrible with grub
[17:34] <jrib> Axio`: what terminal do you use?
[17:35] <threex5> Hi, I tried moving /home to its own partition and now i'm getting all kinds of permisisons errors and nothing will load. Could someone help me understand what I did wrong?
[17:35] <Grandpa_smashy> Terminator i like for terminal
[17:35] <jrib> threex5: how did you move the files?  And what are the permissions of the files in /home now?
[17:35] <Axio`> jrib: it seems to work with the non-obsolete version
[17:35] <nep1x> hi buddies. Is there any way for the path you are in does not appear in the terminal. When the path is long is quite annoying...
[17:36] <kunji1> Grandpa_smashy: The process I use is usually to first set up my partitions with Gparted the way I want them for the whole setup, then I install windows, then I install Ubuntu, and GRUB finds everything very nicely automatically.  If you do the opposite, Ubuntu, then Windows 8, then Windows will overwrite the MBR with it's own bootloader and you need to go the the hassle of reinstalling GRUB using a livecd or the like.
[17:36] <jrib> Axio`: ok
[17:36] <nep1x> thanks
[17:36] <threex5> jrib, I moved them from parted magic live disk
[17:36] <SierraAR> I have a 64 bit Intel CPU, and VirtualBox gives me an option to DL an AMD64 or i386 version; not sure which one I should install
[17:36] <threex5> I can't open the file manager to get file permissions now
[17:36] <threex5> but I can ssh in from another computer
[17:36] <jrib> threex5: ok
[17:36] <kunji1> Grandpa_smashy: This assumes of course that you have the option of starting with a blank disc, otherwise you might have to go the other way
[17:37] <threex5> however, permissions look unfamiliar from here
[17:37] <Grandpa_smashy> K thx ima give it a shot lol.. always a pain with windows
[17:37] <threex5> if i ssh into that machine and go to my new /home directory
[17:37] <Axio`> jrib: thanks a lot
[17:37] <threex5> there's a user folder in there and it says the owner is '1000'
[17:38] <threex5> who can create and delete files
[17:38] <threex5> the group is also '1000'
[17:38] <threex5> and can only access files
[17:38] <kunji1> Grandpa_smashy: googling should turn up quite a few good guide, the Win 7 ones are perfectly applicable to Win 8, even for things like making a USB to boot WIn 8.
[17:38] <threex5> these permissions are the same in my old home directory
=== jack is now known as Guest64827
[17:38] <threex5> that makes me think that permissions look different from remote ssh
[17:38] <threex5> I don't know
[17:38] <threex5> I could also check from command line
[17:38] <threex5> on that computer
[17:38] <usr13> threex5: ls -l /home/threex5 | pastebinit  #Let's have a look.

[17:42] <usr13> *we'll
[17:43] <iter> threex5: if you want to overwrite/repair permissions you can cd to /home and do 'sudo chown -R threexusername:threexusername *'
[17:43] <threex5> ok let me try that first
[17:43] <iter> threex5: do it in your homedir
[17:43] <iter> threex5: and of course you want that threexusername to be whatever user you need
[17:43] <threex5> i'm having a hard time getting my ls output from the terminal on one computer over to the other so i can put it in pastebin
[17:43] <threex5> right
[17:44] <usr13> threex5: The other computer is not connected to the internet?
[17:44] <jrib> threex5: you really want to be careful where you run that command.
[17:44] <michele> after installing ubuntu, how do I recall this screen? http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nu44s.jpg
[17:44] <iter> righto, that command can break things if you run it in the wrong dir
[17:44] <ActionParsnip> iter: may want to specify a path, removes possibility for error
[17:44] <cub> user82,  i just thought it would automatically send it to this channel window heh
[17:45] <usr13> jrib: Yea, it would be better to use full path:  sudo chown -R /home/threex5/
[17:45] <iter> ActionParsnip: good idea
[17:45] <threex5> shoot, i already ran it in /home
[17:45] <iter> threex5: do you have other user dirs in there?
[17:45] <threex5> n
[17:45] <threex5> no
[17:45] <usr13> threex5: ooops.  not good.
[17:45] <iter> you're good then
[17:46] <threex5> ok one person says good, one says 'not good'
[17:46] <iter> it's not good if you have multiple user dirs in home
[17:46] <iter> it's not a problem if there is only one user dir
[17:46] <threex5> ok. well i'll log out and back in and we'll see what happens
[17:46] <usr13> threex5: right.
[17:47] <usr13> iter: That was for you.  Right.
[17:48] <iter> for i in `ls`; do chown -R $i:$i $i; done
[17:48] <iter> that would repair your home dir perms for multiple users
[17:49] <iter> I suppose that needs a sudo in there
[17:49] <jrib> iter: you're making a few assumptions there :)  Also, don't parse ls
[17:49] <threex5> alright
[17:49] <iter> how would you do it jrib
[17:49] <iter> find exec?
[17:50] <threex5> we're in business. Thank you so much. sorry for all the line breaks. i'll try to be better about it in the future.
[17:50] <iter> glad to hear you're fixed threex
[17:50] <jrib> iter: well for not parsing ls, you should just do: for i in *; do blah; done
[17:50] <jrib> iter: here's a good explanation about it: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/ParsingLs

[18:18] <littlebearz> banch: add his user to www-data group
[18:19] <banch> sudo adduser username:www-data ?
[18:19] <littlebearz> banch: useradd -G www-data username
[18:19] <banch> how come if he has account already and setup znc and all. do I need to make it all over again
[18:19] <littlebearz> use usermod
[18:20] <llutz> stop
[18:20] <jrib> banch: you probably don't want to do that... You could just enable userdir and then he could put his website it ~/public_html and it would be available at domain/~username
[18:20] <llutz> useradd -aG www-data username
[18:20] <banch> hmm
[18:20] <littlebearz> banch: usermod -a -G www-data username
[18:20] <caddoo> Any know a good piece of open source cross platform contacts manager? Got someone who is used to the old contact manager Sidekick and need an upgrade.
[18:20] <jrib> banch: I disagree that you should make a user part of the www-data group
[18:20] <llutz> littlebearz:  littlebearz> banch: useradd -G www-data username  <- will remove "username" from all other groups, you don't want that
[18:20] <banch> so usermod is the way to go
[18:21] <llutz> banch: sudo adduser username www-data
[18:21] <littlebearz> llutz: i forgot secondary adding user
[18:21] <littlebearz> llutz: the -a means secondary group
[18:21] <iter> banch: why not just enable public_html
[18:22] <jrib> banch: www-data is what your web server runs as.  So you should use www-data ownership to indicate "this file is something my web server should read/write to".  That usually is not going to be the same as "this file is something username1 should be able to read/write to"
[18:22] <llutz> littlebearz: and that is why people should use adduser, there is no such "dangerous option" you might miss
[18:22] <banch> iter I did not know how to do it and yet i dont know exactly :)

[18:23] <littlebearz> no manual entry for adduser :(

[18:24] <jrib> littlebearz: you're likely not on ubuntu then :)
[18:24] <littlebearz> ops, thehe, i'm on arch or debian
[18:24] <llutz> littlebearz: debian has "man adduser" too

[18:26] <pcsous> cc
[18:26] <littlebearz> rypervenche: yup, that's what I told the person earlier
[18:27] <usr13> tgm4883: you are looking for a Remote Desktop Client?
[18:27] <tgm4883> usr13, yes
[18:27] <tgm4883> one that actually works
[18:27] <usr13> tgm4883: Like tightvnc ?
[18:27] <usr13> tgm4883: There are several that work.
[18:28] <tgm4883> usr13, does tightvnc use the RDP protocol?
[18:28] <littlebearz> tgm4883: use rdesktop
[18:28] <usr13> tgm4883: I sometimes use tightvnc and x11vnc for server.  Yes there is rdesktop
[18:28] <Shortstraw8> usr13,  http://paste.ubuntu.com/
[18:28] <littlebearz> Shortstraw8: where's the URI that follows it?
[18:29] <tgm4883> littlebearz, usr13 rdesktop doens't seem to work well if you're managing more than 10 servers
[18:29] <tgm4883> since it doesn't seem to remember much about anything it's previously connected to
[18:29] <littlebearz> tgm4883: um. concurrently? i think there's a frontend to rdesktop
[18:29] <kickingvegas> fwiw, I use Remmina which I believe is the Ubuntu default
[18:29] <tgm4883> kickingvegas, yes, remmina is a POS

[18:30] <Shortstraw8> littlebearz, usr13 http://paste.ubuntu.com/1538321/
[18:30] <kickingvegas> I've had good results with remmina
[18:30] <usr13> Shortstraw8: Open a terminal, type [or paste]:  pastebinit /var/www/info.php  #And send us resulting URL. Or, tell us what error you get.
[18:31] <usr13> Shortstraw8: See my PM
[18:32] <tgm4883> kickingvegas, the issue I have with remmina, is that it will freeze sometimes when connecting to a VM, and that kills the entire program
[18:33] <tgm4883> s/VM/server/
[18:33] <tgm4883> so if you connect to multiple servers, you now have to reconnect to all of them
[18:33] <tgm4883> which is pretty annoying
[18:34] <usr13> tgm4883: Have you tried to figure out why it freezes?
[18:35] <tgm4883> usr13, does remmina produce any logs?

[19:05] <NuSuey> rypervenche: not moved. just resizing .. there was some free space and i was shrinking the partition from some of the free space
[19:05] <dangersalad> Proshot: is that too many or too few?
[19:05] <Proshot> it used to be around 5 or 6 hundred last time i checked dangersalad

[19:27] <lwizardl> I am trying to install a new GUI mate. I upgraded my 10.04 lts to 12.04 last nght. I hate the unity bs. tried to follow the guide on mates wiki and i'm getting errors
[19:27] <lwizardl> can someone help me with this ?
[19:27] <lwizardl> http://pastebin.ca/2303508

[19:28] <usr13> lwizardl: sudo apt-get install -f
[19:30] <lwizardl> usr13, tried that same issue.
[19:31] <orbitwhite> i got mate without -f or something like that problem
[19:31] <orbitwhite> there is something definitely wrong was done
[19:35] <lwizardl> okay just tried the lxde. if I wanted to run something that looks like windows I would just run windows
[19:36] <atc3030> are there any other binaries like rngd that can significantly boost the performance of an installation.

[19:37] <lwizardl> what I would like is to install mate. but I honestly think that the upgrade to screwed something in the system.
[19:37] <rypervenche> NuSuey: Not sure. I don't use gparted. Check the man page.
[19:38] <phunyguy> navetz, cp with the -p option.   "man cp" to see
[19:38] <NuSuey> rypervenche: havent found anything :(
[19:39] <phunyguy> also, it goes my UID and GID, not by name, so as long as the UID is the same, it should carry over
[19:39] <usr13> lwizardl: I use xfce.  Now if you don't like the way it looks, that is negotiable.
[19:39] <navetz> phunyguy: My external is ntfs will this still work? Or is there a way to copy across the network so I can go laptop to laptop ?
[19:40] <usr13> lwizardl: Are you up-to-date?  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[19:40] <llutz> navetz: tar your old-home, put it on the external, transfer to new laptop, untar, done
[19:40] <lwizardl> usr13, did that about 15 times so far
[19:40] <usr13> lwizardl: Once is enough ;)
[19:41] <navetz> llutz: tar -xfv is the command right?
[19:41] <lwizardl> usr13, I have tried following about 15 guides for installing mate all end in failure.
[19:41] <usr13> lwizardl: What didn't you like about xfce ?

[19:43] <BroUnicorn> usr13: Hey! I used photorec to go in and try to find some files from after I deleted the partition. It found the file extensions, but all the file names were alphanumeric strings. Im assuming this means they're corrupted lol

[19:44] <rypervenche> is*
[19:44] <crackerjackz> i ran this program called bleachbit idr what the option was off of the top of my head but it said something about deleting some files and then overwriting them not sure which files it overwrited but i'd like to delete those files... how do i make bleach bit delete those files? it filled my hard disk up and now i don't have any free disk space
[19:45] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: Oh.. So they could be the files?
[19:45] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: Yep. Most likely are. How did you delete them, on what file system?
[19:46] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: I was trying to recover fl studio files (which are music creation program files). NTSF. Bootcamped windows.
[19:46] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: Did you just delete them or how were they removed?
[19:46] <BroUnicorn> Sadly it found over 2000 files... And I definitely didn't have over 2000project files.
[19:47] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: I had to erase the partition using disk utility due to the partition table getting screwed up when I attempted to install ubuntu, rendering windows unbootable.
[19:48] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: You can probably get the partition table back using testdisk.
[19:48] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: And this would have all of your file names.
[19:50] <MattRac> Hi everybody, hope I can find some help here :-)
[19:50] <MattRac> Today, I updated from 11.10 to 12.04 .  At the end of the upgrade, there is a big list of packages that are proposed for removal. But it said it can take several hours to remove.
[19:50] <lwizardl> well i have decided that I am no longer going to be using the main ubuntu distro. this happens too often for me to continue to use this version
[19:50] <MattRac> I chosen to keep them but I'm facing some issues and I find removing these packages could help. Is there a log where I can find the list of this packages that were proposed for removal ?
[19:51] <MattRac> Thansk ;-)
[19:51] <teazel> Hi. On an old hard drive, I used the Windows installer to install Ubuntu. Then my hard drive died and I had everything (from the Windows partition, but not the Ubuntu one) transferred onto a new disk. I can't find the installer iso file but I still have an "Ubuntu" folder in my user folder. Is it at all possible I can install from this somehow? I don't want to re-download the iso because it's
[19:51] <teazel> a huge file and I have slow Internet/bandwidth cap.
[19:52] <k1l> MattRac: you could clean the apt cache and the old packages with: " sudo apt-get autoremove && sudo apt-get autoclean"
[19:52] <MattRac> k1l: I know "apt-get autoremove" don't do anything (because packages are not orphans), but running autocmean before is a very nice idea. I'll try that for sure ;-)
[19:53] <k1l> teazel: the wubi (windows installer) installs the ubuntu into a container inside the windows system. i dont know how to recover that. and honestly i would recommend to make a native install
[19:53] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: Even after erasing the partition using disk utility?
[19:53] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: Yep.
[19:53] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: And installing ubuntu?
[19:53] <rypervenche> Yep.
[19:54] <BroUnicorn> Because I now have ubuntu partitioned on my mac as well as Osx
[19:54] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: Don't touch the disk anymore. Get a live CD and run testdisk.
[19:54] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: Would you be able to walk me through the process?
[19:54] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: Check out some Youtube videos on how to do it, because it can be a bit confusing on how to use it.
[19:55] <FlowRiser> hey all, i'm installing ubuntu on my asus eeepc 1001ex, any tips, problems i should know before that ?
[19:55] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: I don't know enough about testdisk to use it accurately, but I now how to get testdisk open
[19:55] <teazel> k1l: I don't have a CD/USB disk to burn on to... is there another way to do it?
[19:55] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: testdisk comes in the same package as photorec.
[19:55] <BroUnicorn> FlowRiser: If it has an error installing and pops up the partition tables, don't touch anything.
[19:56] <rypervenche> BroUnicorn: I'll be right back if you need any further help.
[19:56] <FlowRiser> BroUnicorn, i won't have that problem lol, i'm using wubi
[19:56] <BroUnicorn> rypervenche: Right. I have a live disk I used to run photorec. I can get back to testdisk, I just don't know what to do inside testdisk
[19:57] <k1l> teazel: netinstall?
[19:57] <k1l> but you will need some kind of medium, iirc
[19:58] <MattRac> k1l: "autoclean" did something interesting (saying "Del [package name]" a lot of time), but "autoremove" doesn't seem to use it. Any idea how to 'apply' this autoclean ?
[19:58] <teazel> k1l: eh I will probably just use Wubi. Thanks though
[19:59] <k1l> MattRac: it cleans out old packages that are still stored in the cache. its done when it went through
[19:59] <k1l> teazel: wubi causes alot of problems that dont appear on native installs. so most user recommend a nativ instal
[19:59] <MattRac> k1l: But does it really purge the installed packages ?

[20:00] <k1l> MattRac: no

[20:20] <panchorobles> does anybody know what to do with popups about system program problem been detected? on ubuntu 12.04.1 Just disables apport but not sure if the problem still exists
[20:20] <truerocker_redhe> guess its hard to find answers on here?
[20:21] <truerocker_redhe> is this more for people who aren't linux impaired?
[20:21] <FlowRiser> truerocker_redhe, i would answer, but i really have no ideea what exactly is your problem
[20:21] <auronandace> !password | truerocker_redhe
[20:21] <ubottu> truerocker_redhe: Forgot your password? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LostPassword What's the root password? See !sudo. Don't see *** in password prompts? That's normal. Sudo doesn't ask for your password? It remembers you for several minutes. Please use strong passwords, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/StrongPasswords
[20:22] <FlowRiser> panchorobles, look at the logs, might be you removed something and the system can't find it
[20:26] <panchorobles> thank you FlowRiser... will check that
[20:26] <truerocker_redhe> ubottu- i'll check that out thanks, but i have already reset my password and now when i install things i run across errors like
[20:26] <ubottu> truerocker_redhe: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[20:27] <bekks> truerocker_redhe: Most easy approach would be to just reset the user password using a livecd.
[20:27] <Pici> It sounds like the password was already reset....
[20:28] <truerocker_redhe> correct i have already reset it and amcurrently using it just i get insane amount of error messages when installing anything
[20:29] <Pici> truerocker_redhe: We can't help unless we know what errors you are getting. Can you put them on a pastebin?
[20:29] <truerocker_redhe> whats a pastebin?

[20:34] <truerocker_redhe> ok i just installed a random thing to get the error messages through ubuntu software center and copied the error messages but it won't let me paste them anywhere
[20:34] <truerocker_redhe> not even on the pastebin
[20:36] <truerocker_redhe> screw this lol, is there anyway to do a reset or wipeand load online like the is with windows? possibly partitiion my system or something?
[20:39] <tDa> Hello, I'm planning to build a new desktop with an SSD as /. I've never used an SSD on Linux before - are there any precautions I must take, with regard to file system, swap space settings, etc?
[20:39] <tDa> (Swap space should, strictly speaking, be unnecessary - it's going to have 32GB of RAM)
[20:40] <bekks> When planning to use suspend2disk, you have to have 32gb of swap as well.
[20:40] <tDa> Jono Bacon?
[20:40] <wbinvd> tDa: ehehe on windows 7 with 32gb of ram window created 32gb of swap file !
[20:40] <bekks> tDa: Who is "Jono Bacon"?
[20:41] <tDa> I need no suspend2disk - it's a desktop. I'm content with boot up / shut down.
[20:41] <tDa> Well, I seem to recall him being a member of a Linux podcast
[20:41] <tDa> LUG Radio I think it was... many years ago.
=== Krusty is now known as Guest1719
[20:41] <tDa> That's why, when I saw "jono" join, I instantly got that association
[20:41] <disharmonic> Isn't he a Ubuntu dev as well?
[20:42] <bekks> tDa: Then you dont need swap basically - unless the Out-Of-Memory-Killer knocks at your door when using all of your 32GB RAM.
[20:42] <tDa> May well be. If I remember correctly, he has some kind of community manager type role
[20:42] <monod> Hi everyone, I have that frustrating problem with pulseaudio or whatever, please don't redirect me to the wiki page of pulseaudio because I'm just a beginner and I don't understand those wiki so well (at the moment)
[20:42] <tDa> bekks - exactly. I doubt I'll need 32GB of RAM any time soon - but it's cheap, so it doesn't hurt to have
[20:43] <Hwkiller> what is the problem, monod
[20:43] <monod> the problem is that while I'm listening to mp3s with vlc, I can't open any other audio application that vlc stops streaming the audio stream

[20:45] <Krustyklimber> hi again... I am having trouble with connecting hdmi to my tv
[20:46] <Antiga> kushal_kumaran: o..k..
[20:46] <Krustyklimber> all I get is my desktop... no cursor, no video
[20:47] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: You say you get your desktop, but "no video," can you elaborate?
[20:47] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: you have extended the desktop?
[20:48] <wbinvd> i mean you see the wallpaper?
[20:48] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: if you see wallpaper, you probably just extended it instead of cloned it. You'll see your cursor if you move to the left or right, depending on where the TV is oriented :P
[20:48] <Krustyklimber> my background "wallpaper" shows up, but the open firefox window (or even this chat) doesn't show up
[20:48] <Krustyklimber> no cursor
[20:48] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: you have two screens now, not a copy of one.
[20:49] <Krustyklimber> huh? sorry I'm not very tech savvy
[20:49] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: try to move firefox on tv
[20:49] <monod> Krustyklimber, it seems like you have enabled the extended desktop modality
[20:49] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Click the firefox title bar and drag it to the right on your PC
[20:49] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: try left or right
[20:49] <Slart> monod: do you get some kind of error message from vlc when it stops playing audio?
[20:49] <monod> Slart, absolutely not
[20:49] <monod> stops streaming audio.
[20:50] <Slart> monod: you can try running vlc from a terminal.. possible with some kind of --verbose or --debug switch to make it a bit more talkative
[20:50] <monod> o_O
[20:50] <monod> ok..
[20:50] <Krustyklimber> left or right what?
[20:50] <Krustyklimber> all dragging the firefox logo did is move it down the list
[20:50] <monod> Krustyklimber, drag your window, out of the right or left border of the main screen
[20:50] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: pick the fireforx window and drag to tv
[20:50] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Instead of [PC] being projected onto TV, you have [PC] [TV]
[20:50] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Imagine them being next to each other.
[20:51] <Krustyklimber> to tv? I don't see any tv thing on my pc
[20:51] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Move your cursor OFF of your PC screen and ONTO the TV.
[20:51] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: imagine that you have only 1 giant desktop span on 2 video device
[20:51] <Krustyklimber> I can't imagine that, I dunno what you mean
[20:51] <sogeking99> hey guys I am getting screen tearing on my videos on my HDD. Anyway to fix this?
[20:51] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Oh man.
[20:52] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: you see only wallpaper on both video devices?
=== clone1018 is now known as starfish
[20:52] <Krustyklimber> right now... I see this chatroom on my pc, and my desktop on the tv
=== starfish is now known as clone1018
[20:53] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Listen. Look at your PC. Look at your cursor. Move your cursor to the very rightmost part of your monitor on your PC and keep going. Your cursor should now be on the TV.
[20:53] <espressofa_> Hi y'all, it appears that "X" is totally frozen for me. I turned on noquiet and nosplash in grub and I see it starts up LightDM then starts and stops Userspace bootsplash, then it's just hanging. I SSHed in and I see that X is running. I'm not presented with my login window or anything. Just see the boot messages. Any ideas of how to debug? No errors in Xorg.0.log.
[20:53] <Krustyklimber> ok way way right I get the cursor :)
[20:54] <sogeking99> Enabling Tear Free on catalyst removes the tearing, but makes th emotion funny
[20:54] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Ok, do you understand now? You are EXTENDING your desktop, not CLONING it.
[20:54] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: You can click and drag windows OFF of your PC and move them ON to your TV.
[20:54] <Krustyklimber> ok so how do I get video or this chatroom on the tv?
[20:54] <Antiga> Krustyklimber: Click and drag.

[20:56] <Krustyklimber> ok I'll watch video, thanks
[20:56] <sogeking99> Anyone know how to fix this screen tearing issue?

[20:58] <Krustyklimber> awesome... dragged youtube onto the tv... you guys rock as usual
[20:58] <monod> what?
[20:58] <monod> did work?
[20:58] <monod> did you see that video?
[20:58] <Krustyklimber> yep :D
[20:58] <monod> great :)
[20:58] <monod> extended desktop
[20:58] <monod> is what it's called
[20:58] <Krustyklimber> learn somethin new every day :)
[20:58] <monod> another mode
[20:59] <Krustyklimber> now I gotta fix the resolution
[20:59] <monod> is duplicated desktop, where you see a copy of your desktop on every plugged monitor
[20:59] <Miebster> I can I get it so unity doens't move my tool bar to the top, and more importantly, doens't hide all of the menus (file, edit, etc) under the title of the window (you mouse over and it fades to show the menus)
[20:59] <monod> Krustyklimber, the resolution you can get it fixed as usual by the screen settings, I think
[21:00] <maaku> I'm trying to do password-less full-disk encryption, but `update-initramfs -k all -u` is not including the keyscript; anyone know why that might be?
[21:01] <monod> password-LESS encryption? :D
[21:02] <histo> Krustyklimber: what type of video card ar eyou using?
[21:02] <maaku> monod: yes, using a key file on a USB drive
[21:02] <maaku> yank the drive, system data is secure
[21:02] <Krustyklimber> no clue
[21:02] <Krustyklimber> whatever is in my sony vaio
[21:03] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: open a terminal and write lspci
[21:03] <joe9> is there any way I can change the network-manager settings from the command line?
[21:03] <joe9> I do not have access to the gui, just an ssh session.
[21:03] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: some lines may have written ati or nvidia or intel
[21:03] <histo> joe9: you can try using nm-cli
[21:03] <histo> joe9: but i'm not sure it will allow you to change settings. It may just monitor them.
[21:03] <joe9> histo: you mean nmcli?
[21:04] <joe9> it just seems to monitor them.
[21:04] <joe9> as you mentioned.
[21:04] <joe9> where does it store the settings?
[21:04] <histo> joe9: perhaps you can use some other means. What are you trying to accomplish with network manager?
[21:05] <joe9> i just want to change it from dhcp to static ip.
[21:05] <joe9> I do not want to remove the network-manager package
[21:05] <joe9> as it appears that the networking script is not in /etc/rc*.d/
[21:05] <Krustyklimber> lots of things with intel
[21:05] <histo> joe9: then configure resolvconf
[21:05] <joe9> and I would have to do update-rc.d on the /etc/init/networking, which I do not want to do.
[21:05] <joe9> let me check resolvconf
[21:06] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: paste in private your output if u want
[21:06] <Krustyklimber> lol paste where, my what? :P
[21:06] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: the output of lspci
[21:06] <histo> joe9: actualy nvm
[21:06] <joe9> resolvconf is just for nameservers
[21:06] <histo> joe9: I meant /etc/network/interfaces
[21:07] <Krustyklimber> you mean everything that's in that terminal?
[21:07] <joe9> histo, yeah, but how do I start /etc/init/networking
[21:07] <histo> Why are people so against removing network maanger
[21:07] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: select all and then click the whell to paste
[21:07] <joe9> the service is not part of upstart/init anymore
[21:07] <Krustyklimber> whell? I dunno that word
[21:08] <histo> joe9: ther is /etc/init.d/networking
[21:08] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: wheel
[21:08] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: on mouse
[21:08] <joe9> histo: but, no startup scripts for that in /etc/rc*.d/
[21:08] <histo> joe9: so sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart should work
[21:08] <joe9> doesn't that need a S..
[21:08] <joe9> or K..networking
[21:08] <joe9> does that make sense?
[21:09] <escott> maaku, password less full disk encryption is enabled by default
[21:09] <maaku> escott: that was my experience on a previous server. however in this case (a fresh install), the initramfs image does not contain the keyscript
[21:09] <joe9> histo, I can do sudo update-rc.d networking defaults ..
[21:10] <sogeking99> hey guys I am getting screen tearing on my videos on my HDD. Anyway to fix this? Enabling Tear Free on catalyst removes the tearing, but makes the motion funny
[21:10] <Krustyklimber> ok I got it copied, where do I paste it?
[21:10] <joe9> histo: but, I am not sure what the startup number should be
[21:10] <histo> joe9: you asked how to restart networking just sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart works fine
[21:10] <maaku> crypt tab has "md0crypt /dev/disk/by-id/md-uuid-… none luks,keyscript=/sbin/md0script"
[21:10] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: open a private chat
[21:10] <joe9> histo, but, I want that to happen after reboot too.
[21:10] <Krustyklimber> how?
[21:10] <wbinvd> Krustyklimber: wait
[21:10] <histo> joe9: if you edit your interfaces file and set it properly it will happen after reboot
[21:11] <joe9> histo, you are wrong, imho.
[21:11] <histo> joe9: okay
[21:11] <joe9> i think it needs to be setup somewhere. either upstart or sysvinit.
[21:11] <histo> joe9: goodluckthen
[21:11] <escott> maaku, i was joking about your "password-less" the initramfs.conf should specify what gets included in the initramfs, but won't you need bootloader support or is your kernel outside the luks partition?
[21:12] <Emordnys> This is going to sound like a bizzare thing, but my terminal keeps outputting Pen Island in 10.04.
[21:12] <Emordnys> Any ideas on how to get it to stop?
[21:12] <histo> joe9: man interfaces if you don't believe
[21:13] <histo> joe9: also why ask for help and not believe me.
[21:13] <joe9> histo: you are probably correct. just checked /etc/init/network-interface.conf
[21:13] <sogeking99> Does no one know how to fix this screen tearing then?
[21:13] <espressofa_> Should I care that my kernel sometimes tells me "kvm disabled by bios"?
[21:13] <maaku> escott: the boot partition is on the unencrypted usb drive
[21:13] <joe9> seems to use the /etc/networking/interfaces file.
[21:13] <joe9> histo: i do not mean to offend you.
[21:13] <joe9> histo: I was just checking where in the upstart/sysvinit the /etc/network/interfaces file is used/called.
[21:14] <joe9> histo, thanks for pointing that out.
[21:14] <joe9> histo: btw, should I disable network-manager if I am using the interfaces file?
[21:14] <joe9> echo "manual" | sudo tee /etc/init/network-manager.override
[21:15] <Invader> Christ I have no idea how to do this. Maybe someone here might have an idea.They customer access a webpage to run commands for there devices.. In the background is dumps the full commands to a text file. Could be 10-20-400 commands. It’s not normal Linux commands it’s all proprietary commands. So my question is How can I SSH to this thing and have it run all these commands in this text file.
[21:15] <Invader> <Invader> I can SSH or telnet to this thing as access..
[21:15] <Invader> <Invader> I just have no idea how I can tell it to just Run the commands in this file.
[21:15] <bekks> joe9: Every interface configured in the interfaces file will be ignored by network manage by default.
[21:15] <kahtahs_> sogeking99: as it's more ubuntu specific, did you follow https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI#Installation_via_the_Ubuntu_repositories for trying out the fglrx-updates driver
[21:16] <kahtahs_> sogeking99: and there's an even newer driver here: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve#AMD.2BAC8-ATI_Graphics
[21:16] <escott> Invader, you run whatever proprietary commands with whatever proprietary program is required
[21:17] <joe9> bekks: oh, ok. so I do not have to bother disabling it per-se.
[21:17] <joe9> bekks, thanks.
[21:17] <sogeking99> Thanks kahtahs_ I will try that now. I tried the experimental one and it has a massive watermark
[21:18] <cakeboss> Is there a health living channel on this network?
=== clone1018 is now known as MrSwimmy
=== MrSwimmy is now known as clone1018
[21:18] <Invader> escott, They system that did this is dead. So I am left with the file that has all the commands perday that needs to get ran. You can SSH to the system to run these commands One by One if needed. I just want to know if there is a way with SSH to call a file to run these commands.
[21:19] <kingfisher64> anyone have cs6 running in wine strongly? Not individual programs but the suite like http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/design-web-premium.html
[21:19] <Sylphie> Invader \ cut-paste?
[21:19] <maaku> Invader: scp file remote-host && ssh remote-host file?
[21:19] <escott> Invader, ./filename?
[21:19] <Invader> Has to be an auto-process, and run every 5 minutes
[21:20] <monod> does anyone knows anything about multiple applications streaming audio? like 2 media players at the same time?
[21:20] <kahtahs_> sogeking99: that watermark is easy to remove: http://askubuntu.com/a/216730
[21:20] <Sylphie> Invader \ to run something every 5 minutes, put the command in crontab
[21:20] <sogeking99> Ah, thanks again kahtahs_
[21:20] <monod> because I have this problem: I can't *open* two such applications that I can not hear sound anymore
[21:20] <escott> Invader, running something every 5 minutes is obnoxious, and prone to failure if runtime is greater than 5 minutes. a inotify-wait loop might be preferable
[21:21] <makerbreakr> why would ubuntu only detect 1 monitor?
[21:21] <escott> monod, do you not have pulseaudio installed?
[21:22] <makerbreakr> I have an intel graphics card (sandy bridge);  I have two monitors connected via HDMI and DVI, they are both on, and mirroring the desktop
[21:22] <monod> I do not know how to install things, escott. That's hilarious, but that's true. Do all the things go into /bin? btw, how can I check if it's installed? I think so btw.
[21:22] <escott> monod, what version/flavor of ubuntu did you install?
[21:22] <makerbreakr> when I click detect displays in gnome control center, they detect both displays as "samsung monitor", but onyl the display on the hdmi is samsung
[21:22] <monod> ubuntu 12.04, escott (I don't know how to install/uninstall because ubuntu software center works just well, that's why)
[21:22] <monod> precise panglin
[21:22] <monod> pangolin*
[21:22] <Invader> Its can be 30 45 a day I dont care. I know I need to use cron thats a given. The time aside. SCP was an idea as well. But I was just woundering when I am SSH'ing to a machine if i can some how echo whats in the file to have it run the commands
[21:23] <escott> monod, unless you changed something pulse should be installed and should be handling multiple streams
[21:23] <Invader> SCP was my frist idea. But I wanted to keep it really simple SSH to host tell it the local file run and commands
[21:23] <monod> well, is there a solution for resetting any thing done? escott
[21:23] <Sylphie> makerbreakr \ is your video card designed to be fualhead, or is it just single head using dual outputs?
[21:24] <makerbreakr> sylphie, it id designed to be dual head
[21:24] <escott> monod, does "ps aux | grep pulse" output anything
[21:24] <makerbreakr> I had it working actually up until a couple days ago, then I had to re-install, and I cant recreate how ti worked before
[21:25] <monod> http://pastebay.net/1174738, this, escott
[21:25] <Mr_Cool59> hear is my problem i have a laptop with two ATi cards on is a hd 4200 and the other is hd 6300 when i use ubuntu 12.10 and install the drives from amd website i get a mssage that says that it can not find a supported card pleas help i would like to use the newer verson of ubuntu instead of 12.04
[21:25] <Sylphie> makerbreakr \ in that case it should just be an X driver setting
[21:26] <makerbreakr> it looks like it is detecting the correct driver (intel
[21:26] <escott> Invader, i would say scp is better than looping and reading lines from the file. you don't know what the commands are so you don't know if the syntax is a line by line syntax. for all you know the commands are run from the end of the file to the beginning
[21:27] <Sylphie> makerbreakr \ so go to the man page for your intel video and see what settings you have to work with
[21:27] <escott> monod, pulse is running. what applications are not working together?
[21:27] <Invader> escott, I agree its more work but oh well, Thanks!
[21:27] <monod> mixx and vlc. I'm listening to music in vlc now, but if I open mixx it stops streaming (but not playing, vlc goes forward with time)
[21:27] <monod> escot ^^
[21:28] <joe9> is there a way to switch from dhcp to static networking on a ssh connection?
[21:28] <escott> monod, mixx is probably taking direct control over the hardware
[21:28] <joe9> histo, thanks for your help.
[21:29] <escott> monod, its mentioned here http://www.mixxx.org/wiki/doku.php/troubleshooting
[21:29] <monod> escott, damn, so I could have everything working fine, but not mixx because it's a particular situation? damn twice!
[21:29] <monod> I lost the entire evening for nothing then
[21:30] <joe9> bekks: any thoughts, please?
[21:30] <quinn_> Hey guys, trying to install Ubuntu alongside Win8 in (U)EFI mode...
[21:30] <joe9> bekks: I am wondering if there is a way to switch from dhcp to static networking on a ssh connection?
[21:30] <blkadder> joe9: The question doesn't make a lot of sense. What is it you are trying to accomplish?
[21:30] <escott> monod, thats a "high-end" audio processor. its expectation is that it will be the only thing making sounds
[21:30] <manuel_> hi, my ddrescue of a 1000G external HD runs for a few days now, but the last 5 G seem to take hours per MB. if i stop ddrescue now Ctrl+C, will i be able to use/mount the resulting image?
[21:31] <monod> ok
[21:31] <escott> manuel_, maybe
[21:31] <joe9> blkadder:  i am connected through an ssh connection to a remote ubuntu machine. The eth0 on that machine is dhcp, managed by network-manager. I want to switch it to static.
[21:31] <monod> seen now that link
[21:31] <escott> manuel_, is ddrescue trying to reread sectors?
[21:31] <Sylphie> joe9 \ it's easy to reconfig for static ip, but you'll have to shutdown the ssh connection at some point
[21:31] <quinn_> So if I free up some space by resizing down my WIn8 partition, I can install Ubuntu on the free space left over? Can/could/should I use the Win8 bootloader?
[21:31] <joe9> blkadder: as for some reason, whenever dhcpd refreshes the info, it is breaking the ssh connections.
[21:31] <blkadder> joe9: Oh sure that is doable.
[21:31] <escott> quinn_, yes, yes, and no
[21:32] <manuel_> i guess so, i gave it -r 3 (try retry 3 times) but if the relevant data could be rescued in he image already i wont have to tripple check the rest... but i dont want to lose days of work either...
[21:32] <vahnx2> I'm looking for an active backup solution.
[21:32] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ just last night someone was doing what you're asking about and trashed their windows partition table
[21:32] <blkadder> http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/change-ubuntu-server-from-dhcp-to-a-static-ip-address/
[21:32] <vahnx2> oops nevermind
[21:32] <joe9> Sylphie: I was thinking of adding this line to sudo crontab -e "sudo service network-manager stop ; sudo service networking start ; sudo service ssh restart ;"
[21:32] <quinn_> So what should I do?
[21:32] <joe9> blkadder: thanks.
[21:32] <escott> quinn_, with win8 its probably yes, no and no now that i think of it
[21:33] <blkadder> Sure. Note that if you restart networking you will lose your connection.
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest25657
[21:33] <escott> joe9, sudo should never be in cron jobs
[21:33] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ the safest thing to do is install ubuntu onto a second usb drive
[21:33] <makerbreakr> joe9, you can just edit the interface and run /etc/init.d/networking restart
[21:33] <joe9> escott, good point.
[21:33] <escott> joe9, on top of that there is no shell backing cron jobs so... ";" is a meaningless character
[21:33] <quinn_> And then what?
[21:34] <monod> g2g, thanks for the help
[21:34] <monod> bye!
[21:34] <Mr_Cool59> hear is my problem i have a laptop with two ATi cards on is a hd 4200 and the other is hd 6300 when i use ubuntu 12.10 and install the drives from amd website i get a mssage that says that it can not find a supported card pleas help i would like to use the newer verson of ubuntu instead of 12.04
[21:34] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ and then you run ubuntu off that usb drive instead of off your main drive
[21:35] <joe9> escott: makerbreakr: blkadder: does this look alright: http://codepad.org/degRILzZ
[21:35] <quinn_> Hmm. Should I make an ext4 partition in gparted on the USB stick, and then install the bootloader and everything else to the USB stick?
[21:35] <joe9> escott: makerbreakr: blkadder: I did not add anything to /etc/resolv.conf though.
[21:35] <joe9> I figure the dns-nameservers will take care of that.
[21:36] <joe9> this is what dhcp is doing currently: http://codepad.org/3boiBAvM
[21:36] <blkadder> network 192.168.0.0
[21:36] <quinn_> Hmm. Should I make an ext4 partition in gparted on the USB stick, and then install the bootloader and everything else to the USB stick?
[21:36] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ you could do that, and it would work, but it would be better to use a mechanical usb drive than a usb stick, because all the writes to a stick would shorten it's life
[21:36] <quinn_> So a dual boot isn't possible?
[21:36] <joe9> blkadder: thanks.
[21:37] <blkadder> joe9: And I am not certain about the dns-nameservers line... Where did you get that?
[21:37] <joe9> man reslovconf blkadder
[21:37] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ a dual boot off the same drive is possible, it's just not advisable. resizing existing partitions is risky
[21:38] <quinn_> I already resized the Win8 partition and it booted perfectly
[21:38] <quinn_> so is that the risky step over with?
[21:38] <escott> quinn_, then you are halfway there. disable secure boot, install ubuntu
[21:38] <usr13> blkadder: His router more-than-likely has caching nameserver
[21:38] <quinn_> Okay, secure boot is off. Will install Ubuntu to the free space.
[21:38] <blkadder> joe9: Ok.... I would usually put that stuff in /etc/resolv.conf directly but it seems to be supported so it should be fine.

[21:39] <quinn_> Do I install the bootloader to the hard drive like usual?
[21:39] <Rallias> Is there a way I can set a script to run after waking up from hibernate?
[21:39] <escott> quinn_, no
[21:39] <Mr_Cool59> ear is my problem i have a laptop with two ATi cards on is a hd 4200 and the other is hd 6300 when i use ubuntu 12.10 and install the drives from amd website i get a mssage that says that it can not find a supported card pleas help i would like to use the newer verson of ubuntu instead of 12.04
[21:39] <jrib> Rallias: read the information in /usr/share/doc/pm-utils/ probably
[21:40] <quinn_> So don't install the bootloader? I have to manually do the partitions
[21:40] <escott> quinn_, grub-efi creates a folder in the "efi" partition which is a smaller FAT formated partition on the disk
[21:40] <escott> quinn_, there is no "mbr" or "pbr" for a GPT disk
[21:40] <quinn_> Okay, so just leave that dropdown box blank?
[21:40] <usr13> Mr_Cool59: What is "hd 6300"?
[21:40] <escott> quinn_, you still need to say what disk, but its not going to an mbr. it should be the disk that has the FAT formated efi partition
[21:40] <quinn_> That's my hard drive
[21:41] <Mr_Cool59> i have 2 graphacis cards form ati one is a hd 4200 series the other is hd 6300 series
[21:41] <escott> quinn_, and there is a decent chance you'll have to go in and manually fix things... all this is new so you are a bit lucky if it works out of the box
[21:41] <quinn_> it's formatted to efi according to Ubuntu
[21:42] <quinn_> So make an ext4 partition out of the free space and install ubuntu to there, right>
[21:42] <quinn_> ?
[21:42] <usr13> Mr_Cool59: Are you sure you downloaded the correct file?  (What does lspci say about them. Any clues there?)
[21:42] <quick-> hi i am not able to install xvidcap from the tar.gz file .Please help
[21:42] <escott> quinn_, yes
[21:43] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ you need to make at least two partitions, one for ubuntu and one for ubuntu's swap partition
[21:43] <quinn_> it says "no root filesystem defined"
[21:43] <Mr_Cool59> from what i can tell the newer catalyst version does not include any of the legacy card drivers

[21:43] <joe9> blkadder: now, ip addr ls gives me 2 ip addresses: http://codepad.org/SpaGOruk
[21:43] <escott> quinn_, you need to select "/" as the mountpoint for that ext4 partition
[21:43] <joe9> blkadder: anything I can do to make the secondary one the primary ip address
[21:43] <joe9> or, better yet remove the first line from "ip addr ls".
[21:43] <quinn_> I have to have a swap partition? OK
[21:44] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ a swap part isn't always mandatory if you have a huge amount of memory, but it's advisable
[21:44] <Ben64> quinn_: its not necessary, but if you don't have lots of ram you should have one
[21:44] <escott> quinn_, you dont have to, but its needed if you intend to hibernate and desirable in many instances
[21:44] <booh> I'm looking for a live solution to backup files in unbuntu server (shares folders for workstations and Maildir)
[21:44] <quinn_> I have 4gb of memory. What do i format the swap partition as?
[21:44] <Ben64> "swap"

[21:45] <k1l> quinn_: do you even need a swap?
[21:45] <Ben64> 4GB isn't that much
[21:45] <iwf> Good Afternoon
[21:45] <joe9> blkadder: yes, sudo restart networking and sudo start networking.
[21:45] <joe9> blkadder: just to be sure.
[21:45] <quinn_> as escott and sylphie said, it's preferable to have one
[21:46] <k1l> quinn_: if you dont want to make suspend2disk or got a heavy ram consumption there is no need to have a swap with that much ram, imho
[21:46] <blkadder> sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
[21:46] <quinn_> Is 2gb of swap enough?
[21:46] <quick-> hi , is there any alternative to xvidcap in ubuntu ?
[21:46] <Ben64> I don't know, I've maxed out my 4GB before
[21:46] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ at leastas much swap as how much ram you have

[21:47] <iwf> I just tried to install a USB version of Ubuntu...I have a blinking cursor with boot:_
[21:47] <k1l> quinn_: if you make a swap you should make it equally to ram and add a bit
[21:47] <quinn_> So maybe a 6GB swap?
[21:47] <joe9> http://codepad.org/HPruOOZz
[21:47] <iwf> Help!
[21:47] <k1l> quinn_: 4.1GB will do
[21:47] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ sounds good, or 8gb if you have the space
[21:47] <joe9> http://codepad.org/HPruOOZz blkadder
[21:48] <blkadder> joe9: Thanks. Did you remove the dhcp client as well?
[21:48] <k1l> quinn_: but im still on the count on: do you really need one. but if you have alot of hdd space it doesnt matter most times
[21:48] <quinn_> Well I do use hibernated
[21:48] <joe9> http://codepad.org/Vh2HDS97 blkadder
[21:48] <escott> quinn_, then you need 4GB + however much swap you are likely to be using when you hibernate in order to hibernate

[22:32] <makerbreakr> Im running ubuntu server, with lightdm, and fluxbox, but I cant get two seperate displays
[22:32] <lee8oi> iceroot, thanks, actually I just wondered what the default was, I swapped it out for kdm, but I want to switch back.

[22:36] <Sylphie> makerbreakr \ it is fixable by using an xorg.conf file instead of letting it autodetect
[22:36] <makerbreakr> I am using an xorg file
[22:36] <makerbreakr> and I know the xorg file is correct
[22:37] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ you might need to install and configure grub
[22:38] <maaku> escott FINALLY full-disk encryption is working
[22:38] <Sylphie> makerbreakr \ from your description, it sounds like you're getting two displays the way the fluxbox WM is set up to handle that

[22:39] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ you need to boot again from the cd or whatever you booted from before
[22:39] <maaku> basically the new initramfs-tools crypt root system broke in 12.04 the method I had been using and which is well documented online
[22:40] <maaku> I had to create a initramfs-tools script to decrypt the RAID array and then cal vgchange -ay
[22:40] <quinn_> And then what?
[22:40] <Sylphie> quinn_ \ and then you need to install and configure grub, which is linux's bootloader

[22:44] <Papa-Smurf> Hi
[22:44] <Mr_Cool59> i have been on her for probley more then 30 min with no help
[22:44] <Papa-Smurf> Are all ports closed by default with ubuntu?
[22:44] <SonikkuAmerica> Mr_Cool59: Well speak up! I'm all ears! :)
[22:44] <francesco_> My problem is: I was trying to reinstall Ubuntu 12.04 in my computer running win7, but the installation went wrong and now the partition where Ubuntu was installed is formatted, so there is no Grub anymore and when I boot my laptop I only get to grub rescue and nothing else. I put ubuntu on a USB, then changed the booting order in the bios but still I come to grub rescue only
[22:45] <k1l> Papa-Smurf: yes. only when a programm uses a port its opended

[22:45] <Papa-Smurf> k1l How I may open then?
[22:45] <SonikkuAmerica> francesco_: I assume it was a native install.
[22:45] <Sylphie> Mr_Cool59 \ there is no solution for your problem at the present time, AMD's drivers suck and you don't want the open source drivers
[22:46] <Papa-Smurf> k1l,  shall i open them though iptables?
[22:46] <SonikkuAmerica> Mr_Cool59: I would suggest Linux Mint.
[22:46] <Mr_Cool59> open source make the computer very hot and it also has horable battery life
[22:46] <k1l> Papa-Smurf: i think you got a wrong idea of ports
[22:46] <SonikkuAmerica> Mr_Cool59: It's Ubuntu with a lighter desktop environment and extras that make it much much better.
[22:46] <WeThePeople> do i need to input ip address to scan which ports are open using nmap
[22:46] <Super_Dog> Is this a possible solution?  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2000705 - Anybody else have these problems after going from 10.04LTS to 12.04 LTS 64-bit?
[22:46] <francesco_> so what can I do now?
[22:47] <Papa-Smurf> k1l, mmm.. i understand by port what i can track with nmap
[22:47] <SonikkuAmerica> francesco_:  Try reinstalling it in the formatted partition.
[22:47] <k1l> SonikkuAmerica: suggesting mint would help with that issue is not the right way
[22:47] <Sylphie> Mr_Cool59 \ and AMD's drivers don't work at all at this present time, which might save on battery life from non-use, but it's a damned if you do damned if you don't choice
[22:48] <Papa-Smurf> k1l, so i guess port 22 is for ssh
=== Guest8700 is now known as TheWarden
[22:48] <SonikkuAmerica> k1l: True enough... but that beats out 3 zillion lines in the terminal.
[22:48] <k1l> Papa-Smurf: why you want a port to be opened? you still need a programm behind that port listening. so i would assume you wnat a programm that listens to that specific port
[22:48] <Papa-Smurf> k1l,  are we speaking about the same thing?
[22:48] <Papa-Smurf> k1l, yes I have a program that need to listen through that port
[22:49] <k1l> Papa-Smurf: like you wnat "something" on port 22 you install a sshd because its most common to listen on port 22
[22:49] <Super_Dog> I get "Error: Cannot install 'ia32-libs'" when trying to install *.deb Teamviewer package 7 or 8 beta...  Used to work on my 10.04 LTS setup...

[22:50] <Papa-Smurf> k1l,  yes... but what happen if i want to have ssh working on port 72?
=== dniMretsaM is now known as dniMretsaM_away

[22:56] <usr13> Papa-Smurf: To answer your first question:  Are all ports closed by default with ubuntu?  Answer is no.  They are all open.
[22:56] <usr13> Papa-Smurf: What exactly are you trying to do?
[22:56] <SonikkuAmerica> Super_Dog: Also, do you have GDebi installed?

[22:57] <Super_Dog> Yes, I have Gdebi installed...
[22:57] <k1l> Papa-Smurf: that got to be some other problem. and im not finding any wow/wine/ubuntu problem  that deals with the ports

[22:58] <Super_Dog> Didn't give error.... Now let's see...
[22:58] <usr13> Papa-Smurf: If there is no service listening on a certain port, then it might as well be closed because nothing will happen there.
[22:59] <Papa-Smurf> usr13, k1l  i just need to open the port 3724 for WoW, if i do netstat -anltp the only port that seems to listen inbound connections is 22
[22:59] <Super_Dog> Looks like TeamViewer is working.  Forum fix looks like it's legit for this problem so far.
[22:59] <usr13> Papa-Smurf: Look at the application that is supposed to be listening for connection o port 3724 for your problem.
[23:00] <Super_Dog> Must have been something that got screwed up in the 10.04 LTS to 12.04 LTS upgrade.  New install users don't seem to be experiencing this issue.
[23:00] <Super_Dog> Probably a dependency snafu...
[23:00] <Papa-Smurf> usr13 you mean to change the port?

[23:03] <Super_Dog> Bingo....  Up and running now with TeamViewer.  That Forum thread solution worked for me...
[23:03] <SonikkuAmerica> I had tried it with 12.10 (sans Wine) and failed, installed Wine and succeeded.
[23:03] <Super_Dog> Hopefully no more ia32-libs problems.
[23:04] <SonikkuAmerica> Super_Dog: Later trashed 12.10 for LM 14 and did the same thing.
[23:04] <Super_Dog> Yeah, I've got WINE installed on this bad boy already....  At least it shows up in my synaptic as checked off...
[23:06] <Sylphie> SonikkuAmerica \ does linux mint have working support for ipfilter rather than iptables/netfilter?
[23:06] <Super_Dog> Haven't messed with Wine for a while.  Have you found some progress running Windows apps in Wine.  Tried CrossOver Linux a while back and was just too spotty for me.  Ended up running all windows apps I need in VM using Virtual Box.
[23:07] <Super_Dog> Does TeamViewer need Wine for some reason?  I installed the V8 TV beta...
[23:07] <SonikkuAmerica> Super_Dog: Yeah it does. Don't ask why, I dunno.

[23:16] <SonikkuAmerica> francesco_: (I keep forgetting to hit TAB) Seems like we'll have to use insmod for the time being.

[23:18] <francesco_> I see hd0 hd0,msdos2 hd0,msdos1 hd0,msdos3

[23:20] <Super_Dog> Bliepo32:  Not sure if you can do anything other than try and reboot.    Could be rough.  Did you image your drive before resizing?
[23:20] <SonikkuAmerica> francesco_: Is (hd0,X) present? (X is anything)

[23:23] <SonikkuAmerica> francesco_: Actually, what you'll have to do is fix your Windows MBR to boot into Windows and then give installing Ubuntu another shot.
[23:25] <francesco_> I tried to do that but I didn't succeed. I tried to follow some instructions found in google, but apparently from grub rescue there is no much that can be done
[23:25] <SonikkuAmerica> francesco_: It's not done from GRUB rescue.

[23:47] <riderplus> which partition did you choose to install grub to?
[23:47] <riderplus> i see..
[23:47] <bwong> i dont know... it didnt ask
[23:47] <bwong> it just says wipe drive and install ubuntu
[23:48] <bwong> or keep whats win7 and install ubuntu on the side
[23:48] <riderplus> i guess you chose 32 bit install
[23:48] <bwong> umm
[23:48] <bwong> it didnt give an option
[23:48] <bwong> plus i downloaded the x64 bit one...
[23:48] <riderplus> well, are you sure your computer supports x64?
[23:49] <bwong> how do I find out
[23:49] <bwong> its a core i5 computer

[23:50] <francesco_> riderplus: I have 3 different ISO for Ubuntu: 12.04.1 desktop amd64, 12.04.1 desktop-i386 or ubuntustudio 12.04.1 dvd-i386. Which one is better to make the USB bootable drive?
[23:50] <riderplus> francesco_ what proc do you have?
[23:51] <riderplus> francesco_ if you have intel, then go for 12.04.1 desktop-i386
[23:51] <francesco_> AMD A8 quad-core - 64bit... I don't know much more about it
[23:51] <usr13> desktop-i386 or dvd-i386
[23:52] <wlosio> desktop-amd64
[23:52] <wlosio> LD
[23:52] <wlosio> =D
[23:52] <riderplus> then obviously the first option
[23:52] <usr13> I guess it's really just a matter of opinion.
[23:52] <francesco_> riderplus: ok! thank you! I'll try now!
[23:52] <riderplus> it's a matter of compatibility also
[23:52] <usr13> riderplus: What do you man "if you have intel"?
[23:53] <usr13> riderplus: "amd64"  just means   64bit.
[23:53] <riderplus> usually i386 is the best for intel that are not dual core
[23:53] <riderplus> usr13 yes, so?
[23:53] <Pici> !amd64
[23:53] <ubottu> AMD64 and Intel 64 are fully supported architectures on Ubuntu. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CommonQuestions#AMD64_Processors and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amd64 for more information.
[23:54] <riderplus> i told him to choose amd64
[23:54] <p47> can I set up a nautilus fileshared umask in the config file?
[23:54] <usr13> riderplus: Well, I just didn't understand your "if you have intel" phrase.
[23:54] <usr13> sorry
[23:54] <riderplus> np
[23:55] <usr13> Wanted to clarify it not just for you but for anyone else that might be watching, (because I've seen that a number of people get confused by "amd64".
[23:57] <OmnipotentEntity> I have a box that isn't going on and offline when I issue /etc/init.d/networking start and stop, the script is just hanging, anyone know how to start troubleshooting it?
