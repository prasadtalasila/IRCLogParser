[12:18] <hweg162> hi
[12:19] <hweg162> is there any successor for grail? i checked http://bitmath.org/code/grail/ and the download links are dead
[12:23] <bregma> hweg162, there's https://launchpad.net/grail
[12:24] <bregma> it's packaged and available in the last few Ubuntu releases
[12:24] <hweg162> i know it's packaged. i just wondered if there is any development going on.
[12:25] <bregma> it's fairly mature at this point
[12:26] <hweg162> okay, i think i need to explain what i am doing :)
[12:26] <bregma> I'm not aware of any active development, but I could be mistaken
[12:26] <hweg162> i am testing multitouch capabilities on a samsung slate pc series 7
[12:26] <hweg162> with both ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10
[12:27] <hweg162> unity recognizes three finger gesture out of the box, giving the window move and resize handles
[12:28] <hweg162> but four fingers aren't recognized
[12:29] <bregma> you might want to verify the touch data coming from X (xinput -test-xi2) to make sure more than 3 touches are recognized
[12:30] <hweg162> so i need a way to debug this. i installed mtview and ran it. in mtview only two fingers are handled correctly. if i touch the display with three fingers it looks like random coordinates are reported from the hardware/driver/lib/whatever
[12:30] <bregma> sounds like a driver problem
[12:30] <hweg162> kernel driver or Xorg driver or...
[12:31] <bregma> mtview only talks to the kernel
[12:31] <hweg162> oh you are right. it opens /dev/input/event*
[12:32] <bregma> there are some newer tool in the evemu-tools package, let you capture data for later replay
[12:32] <hweg162> btw, i don't know under which circumstances mtview manages to grab that device. sometimes it's "cannot grab device" and sometimes it just works. each time run as root in X.
[12:33] <bregma> you're going to have trouble opening the device reliably while X is running
[12:33] <bregma> it works best from a text console
[12:33] <hweg162> but mtview needs X for displaying its window
[12:34] <bregma> yeah, pretty nasty, that catch-22
[12:34] <bregma> we haven't really used mtview since the XINPUT changes went in to the X server, grabbing the device
[12:34] <bregma> that's what the evemu tools are for
[12:35] <bregma> except they dump text data
[12:35] <hweg162> okay. so the wiki pages are simple outdated?
[12:35] <bregma> most likely
[12:36] <hweg162> okay. i'm gonna check the xinput -test-xi2 thing first
=== dandrader is now known as dandrader|afk
[12:37] <hweg162> so XI2 are multitouch event in Xorg?
[12:52] <hweg162> bregma: if xinput -test-xi2 reports RawTouchEnd and TouchEnd events, does that mean MT is basically working?
=== MacSlow is now known as MacSlow|lunch
[13:18] <hweg162> it looks like xf86-input-multitouch (which isn't installed by default on ubuntu) has its own gesture recognition (instead of doing it with a library on evdev basis). is this driver deprecated?
[13:30] <bregma> hweg162, that driver was deprecated some time ago
[13:31] <hweg162> that's valuable info, thanks
[13:31] <bregma> unfortunately, I don;t know enough about the low-level protocols (evdev, etc) to help out much
[13:32] <bregma> the evdev events are documented, and the xinput events are documented, but not in one central place
[13:33] <hweg162> afaik the kernel delivers MT events using a specific protocol (mtdev?)
[13:42] <bregma> yes
[13:43] <bregma> there are a number of devices out there that do not implement the protocol correctly

[18:10] <LIDH> hello
[18:11] <LIDH> i need help configuring a PS/2 touchscreen device
[18:11] <LIDH> can't get it to be detected
[18:21] <bregma> does 'sudo lsinput' list anything that might remotely look like your input device?
=== dandrader|afk is now known as dandrader
=== dandrader is now known as dandrader|afk
[19:14] <LIDH> nope
[19:15] <LIDH> but i think i found a way to get it installed, problem is now i dont get image, because i created a new xorg.conf
