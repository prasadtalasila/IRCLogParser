[07:41] <head_victim> blahdeblah: no worries, it's an automated thing, I just added a note

[20:37] <blahdeblah> head_victim: I think we've bought ours through Megabuy, but i would just check staticice.com.au for best price
[21:00] <head_victim> blahdeblah: I didn't realise they were at Chermside. If I can't find it cheaper elsewhere at least it's not too far to save on shipping.
[21:19] <blahdeblah> head_victim: There was also a place where they regularly have super specials; i think i saw it on the SAGE-AU mailing list.
