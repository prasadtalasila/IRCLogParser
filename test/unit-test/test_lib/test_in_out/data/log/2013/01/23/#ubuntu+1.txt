[02:53] <ULO> Hows 13.04 running? Any glaring bugs? I want to use it for fun without having things crashing left and right.
[05:34] <gnomefreak> i cant remember the command to show all running apps/services, anyone know off hand
[05:34] <gnomefreak> i thought it was psaux
[05:36] <gnomefreak> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1561743/  is pissing me off
[05:37] <micahg> gnomefreak: do you have raring-proposed enabled?
[05:38] <micahg> gnomefreak: and it's ps aux
[05:38] <gnomefreak> micahg: no
[05:38] <gnomefreak> ah thanks
[05:39] <micahg> gnomefreak: add the following to get more debug output '-o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=true'
[05:40] <gnomefreak> seems i dont have proposed enabled
[05:40] <micahg> gnomefreak: that's a good thing
[05:41] <gnomefreak> micahg: gnomefreak@Development:~$ debug output '-o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=true'
[05:41] <gnomefreak> No command 'debug' found, did you mean: Command 'ebug' from package 'libdevel-ebug-perl' (universe) Command 'udebug' from package 'openafs-client' (universe)
[05:41] <gnomefreak> debug: command not found
[05:41] <micahg> gnomefreak: no, just the stuff in quotes to your apt call
[05:42] <gnomefreak> micahg: it seems i do have proposed enabled. should i comment out the repos
[05:42] <micahg> gnomefreak: yeah
[05:43] <gnomefreak> k thanks. looking at the debug command but its late so im not really thinking yet
[05:44] <micahg> you probably won't need it
[05:45] <gnomefreak> ok cool since i tried every thing i can think of and i always get no command
[05:45] <micahg> apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=true dist-upgrade, ftr :)
[05:46] <gnomefreak> thanks
[05:47] <gnomefreak> still no luck
[05:49] <gnomefreak> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1561763/
[05:51] <micahg> go for debug
[05:52] <micahg> gnomefreak: did you 'apt-get update' before trying to dist-upgrade?
[05:54] <gnomefreak> to start yes
[05:59] <gnomefreak> i got into the option screen, any varibles that i should choose?
[05:59] <micahg> hrm?
[05:59] <micahg> apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=true dist-upgrade should give you what you need
[06:02] <gnomefreak> apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=true when i added dist-upgrade it says dist-upgrade is not a command or something close to it (i clkosed the terminal tab by mistake
[06:02] <gnomefreak> )
[06:02] <micahg> umm, make sure you have a space before dist-upgradE?
[06:03] <gnomefreak> i have plenty of space im not even using 1/16th of my harddrive the drive is 250gigs
[06:04] <micahg> apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=true dist-upgrade
[06:04] <micahg> sorry, sudo apt-get -o Debug::pkgProblemResolver=true dist-upgrade
[06:05] <gnomefreak> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1561787/
[06:07] <IdleOne> I would just wait 18 hours and try again
[06:08] <IdleOne> seems like way too much broken to go risking it right now
[06:08] <micahg> nothing should be broken, that's the problem
[06:09] <gnomefreak> ok ill try to run install -f just to see if it helps
[06:09] <gnomefreak> nope no help
[06:09] <gnomefreak> thanks guys for trying
[06:17] <micahg> gnomefreak: why do you have a quantal repo for software center enabled?
[06:17] <micahg> gnomefreak: try to ppa-purge that and see what happens
[06:23] <gnomefreak> i didnt think i did, i guess i can change that easy enough
[06:23] <gnomefreak> ppa-purge would get rid of all my ppas
[06:25] <micahg> gnomefreak: no, you can remove just one
[06:26] <micahg> sudo ppa-purge ppa:foo/bar
[06:26] <gnomefreak> it does nothing to use raring
[06:26] <gnomefreak> what is wrong with the software center being used?
[06:27] <micahg> it might have different dependencies
[06:28] <gnomefreak> k ill trybut im not real sure how to use ppa-purge
[06:28] <micahg> I just told you...you can see which PPA with apt-cache policy software-center
[06:28] <micahg> if it's too much at this hour, maybe try after getting some sleep
[06:32]  * micahg should head to bed himself
[06:32] <gnomefreak> here is output http://paste.ubuntu.com/1561824/  it only shows ubuntuone nightlys
[06:33] <gnomefreak> have a good night sleep
[06:33] <micahg> gnomefreak: right, ppa-spurge ppa:ubuntuone/nightlie
[06:33] <micahg> gah
[06:33] <micahg> sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntuone/nightlies
[06:33] <gnomefreak> micahg: what will happen to the repo with that command
[06:34] <micahg> gnomefreak: commented out
[06:34] <gnomefreak> thanks
[06:34] <micahg> and whatever was installed gets downgraded to raring versions
[06:35] <gnomefreak> gnomefreak@Development:~$ sudo ppa-purge ppa:ubuntuone/nightlies
[06:35] <gnomefreak> [sudo] password for gnomefreak:
[06:35] <gnomefreak> sudo: ppa-purge: command not found
[06:35] <micahg> hrm, you'd need to have it installed first
[06:36] <gnomefreak> ah, app is called ppa-purge?
[06:36] <micahg> yep
[06:37] <gnomefreak> nope it doesnt seem to be
[06:37] <gnomefreak> gnomefreak@Development:~$ install ppa-purge
[06:37] <gnomefreak> Reading package lists... Done
[06:37] <gnomefreak> Building dependency tree
[06:37] <gnomefreak> Reading state information... Done
