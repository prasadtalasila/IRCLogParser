[11:29] <ikt> hey head_victim 
[11:45] <head_victim> Evenign ikt 
[11:54] <sagaci> hi
[11:56] <ikt> hey guys :D
[11:56] <ikt> I think I might be back again
[11:57] <ikt> Was watching
[11:57] <ikt> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122/
[11:57] <ikt> when I realised playing wow how unproductive I am
[11:59] <ikt> and I got an email from s.fox
[12:00] <ikt> and I've been invited to be a global mod on ubuntu forums
[12:17] <ikt> poke :/
[12:23] <head_victim> Score, nice work with the mod thing
[12:24] <ikt> XD
[12:24] <ikt> was walking around like i'd won an oscar for a while there
[12:24] <head_victim> I'm only here right now because I'm procrastinating on an assignment due Wednesday myself. So me talking about productivity is not a good thing :P
[12:24] <ikt> lol
[12:24] <ikt> been there man
[12:24] <ikt> so many times
[12:24] <ikt> like every assignment I've ever been given? :/
[12:25] <head_victim> Hah well with a minimum of 2 assessment pieces per subject every 2 months there's always something on for me :/
[12:27] <ikt> I'll be heading back in a month or 2
[12:27] <ikt> or whenever the next period starts
[12:28] <head_victim> Cool, my silly course only had a 3 week break over Christmas :/
[12:28] <ikt> turns out I have learning difficulties and without ritlin or something like it I can't do anything :D
[12:28] <ikt> or as jim jeffries said.. i'm an idiot
[12:29] <ikt> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtbvStm0Sp8
[12:29] <head_victim> I don't know if it's good or bad but I had to google jim jeffries to figure out who he was.
[12:29] <ikt> ohh
[12:29] <ikt> he's one of the best aussie comedians ever
[12:29] <ikt> if you're into his style of comedy
[12:29] <ikt> which is very... blunt
[12:30] <ikt> and misogynistic and all round shock humour
[12:32] <head_victim> Fair enough, I'll look him up one time.
[12:36] <dns53> is anyone at linux.conf.au?
[12:36] <head_victim> dns53: nah I can't ever seem to make it back. Maybe if they're in Brisbane again I can organise it.
[12:37] <dns53> how bad is the weather where you are?
[12:38] <head_victim> dns53: settled down now, was pretty wet and windy for a long while there.
[12:40] <ikt> wish I was there
[12:40] <ikt> not in the storm
[12:40] <ikt> but at linux.conf.au
[12:41] <dns53> i'm looking for the keynote on friday, sir tim berners-lee
[12:42] <ikt> oh yeah!
[12:42] <ikt> is there streaming happening?
[12:43] <ikt> I saw it  mentioned on the mailing list 
[12:49] <dns53> no idea about streams, the talks are being recorded so if they are not streaming they will have the video's soon after the conference
[13:43] <ikt> awesome
