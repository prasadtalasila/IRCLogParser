[12:54] <hamo> Would you please give me a Ubuntu cloak?
[12:57] <topyli> hamo: are you an ubuntu member? if so, please provide a link to your launchpad page and we can help
[12:58] <hamo> topyli: my launchpad username is hamo
[12:59] <hamo> topyli: https://launchpad.net/~hamo
[13:01] <topyli> looking, but you don't seem to be a member. let me look better :)
[13:02] <hamo> topyli: actually, I am an employer of Canonical
[13:03] <hamo> topyli: sorry, employee
[13:03] <topyli> hamo: yeah, but that's different. see here: https://launchpad.net/~ubuntumembers
[13:03] <hamo> topyli: So I could just apply for Canonical cloak?
[13:04] <topyli> hamo: i suppose. does canonical have their own group here on freenode?
[13:05] <topyli> hamo: it shouldn't be too hard for you to become an ubuntu member as well though, just apply
[13:05] <hamo> topyli: Ok..Thanks, will apply
[13:05] <topyli> cheers
[13:06] <topyli> the page is long, but the actual drill is simple: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership
[13:06] <hamo> topyli: Many thanks.
[13:07] <topyli> welcome to the funny farm! :)
