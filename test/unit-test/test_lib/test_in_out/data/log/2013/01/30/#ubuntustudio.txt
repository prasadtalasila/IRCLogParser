[04:58] <xrs> how do i install my custom TTY font in xfce without using terminal or manually placing the font in a folder?
[04:59] <holstein> xrs: thats how i do it
[05:00] <holstein> xrs: you can gksudo open a file manager and manually move it that way
[05:00] <holstein> xrs: you can probably add them somewhere in your /home without root access
[05:00] <Unit193> /home/user/.fonts/
[05:00] <holstein> xrs: i would join the xubuntu mailing list and ask... or just search for a guide
[05:00] <xrs> in standard ubuntu you just double click the font which opens in some app and you click an install button. unfortuately they are vague on what package it is that handles this
[05:01] <Unit193> !ttf
[05:01] <ubottu> Font installation basics here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FontInstallHowto - No fonts in Flash? Install "ttf-mscorefonts-installer" (from !Multiverse), "gsfonts", and "gsfonts-x11". For the official ubuntu font, see: http://font.ubuntu.com/
[05:01] <holstein> xrs: ubuntustudio *is* standard ubuntu.. you find out what "some app" is, and you can install it
[05:02] <xrs> heres the problem, i dont want to do it manually i want an easy way for  inexperienced users to just click to open then click iinstall like in that ^^ link. but in Studio, it doesnt work that way
[05:02] <holstein> xrs: i usually just do it for users
[05:03] <holstein> xrs: i consider sudo mv to be quite easy
[05:03] <xrs> i am trying to ask in ubuntu what package that is but right now its full of people like me asking questions n not really any one with answers. i will gladly write up a new wiki or whatever 4 studio once i figure this out
[05:03] <holstein> xrs: also, opening a root filemanager is not that challening, though it can be easy to break things
[05:04] <holstein> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts that Unit193 linked looks helpful
[05:04] <xrs> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts#Installing_downloaded_fonts_in_Ubuntu_10.04_LTS  <-- this is what i am trying to do. studio does not seem to do this as the font opens in fontforge
[05:04] <holstein> xrs: you can always just seach "fonts" in the repos
[05:05] <xrs> ....its a custom font not found in any repo
[05:05] <Unit193> !info gnome-font-viewer
[05:05] <holstein> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts#Via_Synaptic should work
[05:05] <ubottu> gnome-font-viewer (source: gnome-font-viewer): font viewer for GNOME. In component main, is optional. Version 3.6.0-0ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 31 kB, installed size 144 kB
[05:05] <holstein> xrs: you might want to ask the font maintainers how they expect you to install them
[05:05] <xrs> thank you Unit193
[05:06] <Unit193> xrs: Sure.
[05:06] <Unit193> I don't know for 100% sure, but looks like it to me.
[05:09] <xrs> yes Unit193, this is exactly what i was looking for thank you
[05:18] <xrs> hmm... seeing as how its a gnome package how should i get the word out that that package is what you need if you want to install fonts by clicking on them?
[05:27] <Unit193> I'd say edit the wiki page and put the title in (wisely, of course)
=== zequence_ is now known as zequence
=== smartboyhw_ is now known as smartboyhw
[21:37] <NoTchTesT> any AV editor here?
