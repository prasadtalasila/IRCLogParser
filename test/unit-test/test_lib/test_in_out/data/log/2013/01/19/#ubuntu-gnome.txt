[01:03] <atrus> nautilus can open my mtp device (android phone), but if I try to browse around in ~/.gvfs, all i see is a a bunch of files and folders named strictly by numbers.i see some suggestion that it should show up under /run/user/<login>/ , but there's nothing there. there *is* a ~/.gvfs/mtp:host=%5Busb%3A001%2C013%5D
[10:07] <darkxst> ricotz, any luck with the stuck input bug?
[10:07] <darkxst> i.e. overview/alt-tab
[11:30] <ricotz> darkxst, havent seen the problem i described ever since
[11:31] <ricotz> neither your problem
[11:32] <ricotz> on raring i am pretty sure eglibc is/was the problem
[11:32] <ricotz> (using the infinity's ppa)
[11:51] <darkxst> ricotz, ok will try update eglibc tomorrow, once I have access to my other computers again (hopefully)
[14:39] <ricotz> darkxst, pushed a gjs/g-s bundle build against mozjs188 to staging, although gjs might be broken due the mainloop conversion which fails its tests
[20:03] <darkxst> ricotz, ok cool
[20:06] <darkxst> I suppose thats a dependency issue?
[20:12] <ricotz> darkxst, dependency issue?
[20:13] <darkxst> broken test, but no just tried building it, its just broken
[20:14] <ricotz> huh, can you rephrase that?
[20:14] <ricotz> i am saying the mainloop stuff converted from c to js might include an error
[20:15] <ricotz> and drop some fix to remove all closures on "quitting"
[20:15] <ricotz> the memleak test is what fails
[20:15] <darkxst> oh right, hadnt seen that commit
[20:17] <ricotz> it runs fine, but is probably leaking some additional stuff now
[20:18] <darkxst> is this specific to js188 though? or just general fallout from the conversion
[21:21] <ricotz> darkxst, general
[21:30] <darkxst> ok
