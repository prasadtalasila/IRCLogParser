[22:08] <bkerensa> HP and MS says Windows is cheaper than Linux
[22:08]  * bkerensa rolls eyes
[22:41] <bkerensa> bdmurray: could you mark Bug #1104209 for Quantal as In Progress
[22:42] <lubotu1> bug 1104209 in xorg-server (Ubuntu Raring) "Pointer can't cross screens on multiple X screen configuration" [High,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1104209
[22:45] <bdmurray> done
[22:45] <bkerensa> thanks
[22:51]  * blkperl sometimes wonders if bdmurray is an highly intelligent irc bot
[22:52] <blkperl> 3 minute response time
[22:58] <bkerensa> bdmurray: I would like to SRU Propose that bug now
[22:58] <bkerensa> bdmurray: my first time doing a SRU proposal is it possible for you to look at it?
[22:59] <bdmurray> bkerensa: sure
[23:00] <bkerensa> bdmurray: bryce saw the patch and agreed on it landing... he said he would sponsor it
[23:03] <bdmurray> bkerensa: the regression potential is a bit lacking - maybe something like its possible that the cursor would be stuck on the second screen...  but I'd still accept the sru upload
[23:05] <bkerensa> bdmurray: ok I have changed it to that... Is there anything else I need to do? Do I need to add a tag or subscribe SRU team?
[23:08] <bdmurray> bkerensa: bryce should do that when he uploads the package to -proposed for quantal
[23:08] <bkerensa> ok
