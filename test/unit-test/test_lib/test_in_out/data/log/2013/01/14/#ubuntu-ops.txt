[02:15] <bazhang> daftykins "support" advice seems rather sketchy
[02:16] <bazhang> eol: dont upgrade   ;  sound issues : check settings
[02:17] <k1l_> yes. i got that opionon some days ago too. was just another issue, yet

[13:49] <ubottu> In #ubuntu, hypopedata said: ubottu: I do not think this is the problem. The colours and the resolution of the grub menu and this warning box are correct. I need to get into command line because the computer freezes when I click OK.
[15:30] <bazhang> <_joey>  chmod 755 /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf
[15:30] <bazhang> that seems odd
[15:39] <ikonia> xwhy would you need to do that ?
[15:39] <bazhang> _joey did that
[15:39] <ikonia> seems pointless
[15:39] <bazhang> especially as it's not even there
[15:40] <ikonia> unless he's messed up the permissions
[15:40] <bazhang> he has, yet claims not to have done nothing
[15:41] <Myrtti> meet just crossposted his question to #u, -uk and -fi. I don't even want to know which other channels he posted it in
[16:00] <bazhang> @mark #ubuntu _joey repeated warnings on language, all ignored [_joey] (~joey@49.176.5.3): Alex M
[16:00] <ubottu> The operation succeeded.

[22:16] <ccc> i am hear to discuss my removal
[22:17] <ikonia> good, do you think the #ubuntu-offtopic channel is for use to find channels to talk about penile implants ?
[22:18] <ccc> yes
[22:18] <ikonia> and as you've just sent me a priate mesage telling me "fuck you" - we are done here, please leave the channel
[22:18] <ccc> thanks
[22:39] <elky> "oh noes, he swore at me in PM, my mind has been changeded!"
[22:39] <elky> honestly, do they really think that's what's going to happen?
