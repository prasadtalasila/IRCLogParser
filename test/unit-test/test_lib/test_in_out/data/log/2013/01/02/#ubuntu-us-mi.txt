[01:56] <rick_h_> bah I fail https://plus.google.com/u/0/116120911388966791792/posts/XhKWQRxK7Zm
[02:39] <jjesse> greg-g, happy birthday according to google
[02:42] <greg-g> jjesse: heh, I should update that.
[02:43] <greg-g> never trust a Jan 1st bday on a social network ;)
[02:43] <greg-g> my bday is actually July 2nd
[02:43] <jjesse> i did a google search and it said "tell greg-g happy birthday"
[02:43] <jjesse> and i was pretty sure that wasn't it :)
[02:43] <greg-g> heh
[02:43] <greg-g> I wondered why I got 2 bday texts today :)
[02:49] <brousch1> greg-g: I don't suppose you'll be in MI at the end of the month? We may be having an open source philosophy meeting at GrWebDev
[02:53] <brousch1> Hm, maybe we could do remote Q&A
[02:58] <greg-g> brousch1: huh, awesome, but no, I leave on Saturday morning
[02:58] <brousch1> Darn
[03:09] <widox> greg-g: hey, Jan 1 _is_ my bday :p
[03:29] <Blazeix> widox: happy birthday :)
[03:32] <widox> Blazeix: thanks!
[03:50] <snap-l> widox: Happy Birthday!
[03:50] <snap-l> You share your birthday with the Gregorian calendar.
[12:49] <Wolfger> Happy New Year!
[13:03] <snap-l> Happy New Year to you too, Wolfger!
[13:05] <brousch> Welcome back to work!
[13:05] <rick_h_> booooooo
[13:05] <rick_h_> man, great day to drop off the boy at day care...phew
[13:06] <brousch> Bad morning?
[13:06] <brousch> My kid woke up at 5-5:30 every morning on vacation, but slept until 6 this morning
[13:07] <rick_h_> my wife had to work so I had him each morning. After going through 8 pairs of underwear/pants yesterday...glad to drop him off :)
[13:07] <brousch> ouch
[13:09] <brousch> http://i.imgur.com/P5n5r.png
[13:17] <rick_h_> lol
[13:30] <Wolfger> heh
[13:31] <Wolfger> back to work isn't so bad. Almost hitting a deer on the final mile of the long commute in wasn't fun though.
[13:31] <rick_h_> woot
[13:32] <brousch> You have deer in Detroit? I thought it was all wild dogs and squirrels
[13:32] <rick_h_> had them in our back yard twice
[13:34] <Wolfger> I'm out in Whitmore Lake today
[13:34] <Wolfger> though I have heard of deer in Detroit, never actually seen one
[13:35] <Wolfger> more squirrels than you can shake a pack of wild dogs at
[13:36] <snap-l> We have deer in the suburbs
[13:37] <Wolfger> Yes indeed. But as a native Detroiter, I seldom refer to anything North of 8 Mile as Detroit
[13:38] <Wolfger> And never to anybody from Michigan. The further away from Michigan you go, the more of the state Detroit occupies. :-D
[13:48] <brousch> I use Detroit to refer to anything East of 23 and South of (including) Flint
[13:49] <brousch> Mostly because it irritates anyone who doesn't live in Detroit proper
[14:04] <Wolfger> LOL
[14:05] <Wolfger> When I go to Japan, all of the lower peninsula is Detroit.
[14:06] <Wolfger> ...and I don't think they know the UP exists
[14:57] <greg-g> Wolfger: many americans don't know the Up exists
[14:58] <rick_h_> they're canadian wanna-bes :P
[15:18] <Wolfger> ya, eh?
[16:07] <snap-l> Oy eh
[17:06] <rick_h_> http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/ubuntu-product-launch-omg-google-hangout
[17:19] <jrwren> 25more minutes
[17:44] <Wolfger> do we have an inside scoop on what the announcement will be?
[17:44] <Wolfger> or is, or was? I might be a bit late in responding :-p
[17:45] <rick_h_> 15 more min
[17:49] <jrwren> oh, what? they aren't doing it on time?
[17:49] <rick_h_> 1pm isn't it?
[17:49]  * rick_h_ checks timezones again
[17:49] <jrwren> 17:45 is what it says
[17:49] <Wolfger> site says "event has passed"
[17:50] <rick_h_> http://www.ubuntu.com/ 10min
[17:50] <rick_h_> hmm, seems something confused on OMG Ubuntu
[17:50] <rick_h_> there we go
[17:50] <rick_h_> hangout is on the page now
[17:50] <rick_h_> http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2013/01/ubuntu-product-launch-omg-google-hangout
[17:50] <jrwren> hangout is up
[17:51] <rick_h_> oh heh, this is just OMG ubuntu chat hangout
[17:51] <jrwren> yup
[17:51] <jrwren> weak
[17:51] <rick_h_> guess I'll keep reloading the main site
[17:52] <Wolfger> hmm. can't seem to get my audio working on the laptop today.
[17:52] <Wolfger> oh well. Back to work
[18:04] <snap-l> Oh yay, a phone with Ubuntu on it.
[18:05] <snap-l> I'm not sure why I should be getting excited over this. :)
[18:07] <lmorchard> Tired : Apple keynote / Wired : Ubuntu keynote?
[18:08] <jrwren> i can't get to ubuntu.com, LOL
[18:08] <snap-l> I can't get excited over mobile
[18:09] <snap-l> I mean, I love my phone, don't get me wrong
[18:09] <jrwren> why not?
[18:09] <snap-l> and I see where this could be a smart move
[18:09] <jrwren> if enough people had open phones and we all did a mesh, we wouldn't need phone companies :p
[18:10] <snap-l> Maybe it's because I think phone companies are a bag of assholes
[18:10] <lmorchard> assholes powering pinwheels
[18:44] <rick_h_> derekv: you coming to CHC?
[18:50] <jrwren> if it is all open source, I totally want an ubuntu phone
[18:54] <brousch> They should hand them out to Canonical employees to eat their own dogfood
[18:59] <_stink_> then we steal it from them?
[18:59] <rick_h_> hah
[18:59] <Blazeix> it sounds interesting, as long as they don't try to tie it to their cloud offering
[18:59]  * rick_h_ does run a galaxy nexus though...
[18:59] <rick_h_> Blazeix: :P
[18:59] <brousch> _stink_: Yeah. Beat them up and steal their phones
[19:00] <_stink_> enlist Wolfger
[19:04] <snap-l> Heh
[19:04] <snap-l> Yeah, the OSS aspect is the most appealing to me
[19:04] <snap-l> but outside of that, Android has really captured my heart.
[19:05] <snap-l> That said, if I can program the thing without using Java, I'm all ears. ;)
[19:05] <lmorchard> Since I'm working on some B2G bugs at Mozilla, this ubuntu phone business is relevant to my interests
[19:06] <snap-l> B2G =?
[19:06] <lmorchard> FirefoxOS
[19:06] <snap-l> Ah, WebOS 2.0. ;)
[19:06] <lmorchard> Phones that boot straight into a stripped down Firefox and run web apps
[19:06] <lmorchard> Pretty much, yeah
[19:06] <snap-l> lmorchard: CHC tonight?
[19:07] <snap-l> It's not snowing like hell. ;)
[19:07] <lmorchard> Hmm, I don't think I can make it tonight :/ But, next week perhaps
[19:07] <snap-l> You're near Campbell road, right?
[19:07] <lmorchard> Maybe I can come and do show & tell with my FirefoxOS dev phone and this chromebook I shoehorned ubuntu onto
[19:08] <snap-l> If you need a ride, I'll drive.
[19:08] <lmorchard> Oh, heh, no, just got plans with the missus
[19:08] <snap-l> Ah, no worries then
[19:08] <lmorchard> I'm now at crooks & washington, so I have less excuse than ever to miss CHC
[19:08] <snap-l> I think I pass right by you
[19:09] <snap-l> I usually take 11 mile
[19:10] <lmorchard> Hmm, my evening plans may fall through, so I may yet go to CHC
[19:11] <brousch> snap-l: Kivy
[19:12] <brousch> snap-l: Don't even need Eclipse!
[19:15] <_stink_> wow
[19:15] <_stink_> neat
[19:18] <brousch> So the Ubuntu SDK uses QML (Qt modeling language)?
[19:27] <nullspace> anyone else having issues with the secs.oakland.com mirrors
[19:29] <nullspace> just switches to archive.ubuntu mirrors and there is a massive number of packages for update that I didn't get on the secs mirror, there may be more to this but this update is taking a fair bit of time to complete
[19:47] <jcastro> ping the admin
[19:47] <jcastro> maybe it's not syncing enough
[19:58] <nullspace> wow cups and openjdk-7-jre was busted
[19:58] <nullspace> I don't know who the admin is
[20:06] <jrwren> if only the ubuntu phone ui used e17 like the samsung phones :p
[20:08] <brousch> They need a command line install so you can apt-get install unity-phone or plasma-active or tiled-phone-ui-of-the-month
[20:29] <brousch> Is the Ubuntu on Nexus7 the same as Ubuntu on phones?
[20:32] <jcastro> no, ubuntu nexus is just normal ubuntu
[20:34] <snap-l> I think we should call Ubuntu on phones ibinti
[20:35] <snap-l> Aparently in Tagalog it means the calf of the leg.
