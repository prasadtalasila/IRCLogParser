[16:17] <ev> - My branch to group error reports that should not disturb the user with the
[16:17] <ev>   next one that should is ready for review:
[16:17] <ev>   https://code.launchpad.net/~ev/apport/grouped_reports/+merge/144591
[16:17] <ev> - Helping jjo get the error tracker infrastructure deployed to stagingstack \o/
[16:17] <barry> it was a s-c bug
[16:17] <ev> - Chat with James Troup on whether it makes sense to rework the retracers to
[16:17] <ev>   use EBS rather than ephemeral storage. EBS on OpenStack was *much* faster in
[16:17] <ev>   his tests, but he felt that using it now would be premature optimisation. We
[16:17] <ev>   can always scale out more retracers.
[16:17] <ev>   - Took an action to bolt gnuoy's script to clear the caches on 80% disk usage
[16:17] <ev>     to the prodstack infrastructure.
[16:17] <ev>   We also agreed that we can run the secondary single-node Cassandra cluster on
[16:17] <ev>   prodstack. This if you don't recall will be used for backup (both failover
[16:17] <ev>   and saving state) and non-write Hadoop jobs.
[16:18] <ev> - Dug deeper into d3.js over the weekend, refactoring a lot of the code I wrote
[16:18] <ev>   to create the average errors per calendar day graph. I'm trying to fix the
[16:18] <ev>   milestone and date overlap problem while making the full graph easier to
[16:18] <ev>   read.
[16:18] <ev> - Sprinting.
[16:18] <ev>   - Trying to bring whoopsie's memory usage down to a more acceptable level. I
[16:18] <ev>     replaced the Dbus-based NetworkManager calls with libnm calls, this getting
[16:18] <ev>     rid of a hard to track memory leak in our usage of GVariant. GVariant has
[16:18] <ev>     proven really difficult to get right since we started writing whoopsie.
[16:18] <ev>   - Plugged a few memory leaks discovered with valgrind.
[16:18] <ev>   - Built out tests to run whoopsie for 15 seconds under valgrind, then run the
[16:18] <ev>     entire test suite under valgrind. This means we run the suite twice, but I
[16:18] <ev>     think that's a reasonable compromise for being able to run tests using the
[16:18] <ev>     normal GLib memory allocator.
[16:18] <ev>   - Somehow memory usage has increased quite dramatically with all these
[16:18] <ev>     changes, so I'm bisecting.
[16:18] <ev>   - Started to look into reducing the number of wakeups in whoopsie. The big
[16:18] <ev>     cause of this at the moment is GNetworkMonitor, which we use to track
[16:18] <doko> slangasek just notes he doesn't have any irc connection at the moment
[16:18] <ev>     changes to the network state:
[16:18] <ev>     http://developer.gnome.org/gio/2.32/GNetworkMonitor.html#GNetworkMonitor-network-changed
[16:18] <ev> Blueprints have mostly remained unchanged this week with the sprint. I've taken
[16:18] <ev> on one additional workitem so far to reduce whoopsie's memory usage. Let me
[16:18] <ev> know if there's anything else I personally should be looking at. I'm keen on
[16:18] <ev> seeing how performant apport is on the Nexus 7 just as soon as I can figure out
[16:18] <ev> this VPN nonsense.
[16:18] <ev> (done!)
[16:18] <doko> done! or !done?
[16:19] <slangasek> unless I've fallen off the network suddenly :)
[16:19] <slangasek> why yes, I sure have

[16:28] <cjwatson> Nexus 7 sprint:
[16:28] <cjwatson>  - Fixed valgrind to not strip vgpreload* on ARM so you don't need valgrind-dbg, and applied patch to implement VCVT.F64.[SU]32 instructions.
[16:28] <cjwatson>  - Fixed memory leaks in upower.
[16:28] <cjwatson>  - Tracked down some of update-notifier's memory use (and probably others) to incorrect timestamps created by installer bug; filed bug report which has been fixed.
[16:28] <cjwatson>  - Mailed ubuntu-devel about some strategies and tools for attacking memory leaks.
[16:28] <cjwatson>  - Further work on update-notifier, trying to find more memory inefficiencies since I think its use is unreasonable.  I'm going to need to tidy up some more before I can see the real problems.

[16:31] <cjwatson> heh, achiang asked that too
[16:31] <cjwatson> I think most of those are not really suppressable - the bulk are reference cycles and such
[16:32] <cjwatson> but I guess you mean singletons

[16:32] <cjwatson> I actually think it'd be better to finish pushing gtk up the hill such that you can actually free those properly on exit - there've been a few upstream bugs about it over the years and general consensus that we should
[16:33] <ev> excellent. I'm all for that
[16:33] <cjwatson> ev: refdbg> next on the list - it does at least still build (you need libglib2.0-0-refdbg)
[16:33] <ev> it's a shame that there's no such thing for the gvariant case, but oh well
[16:33] <cjwatson> no which thing?
[16:34] <ev> refdbg
[16:34] <cjwatson> ah, didn't realise it didn't handle gvariants
[16:34] <ev> I don't *think* it does, but don't quote me
[16:35] <cjwatson> Maybe it's not enough of a GTye

[16:35] <slangasek> [TOPIC] Bugs
=== meetingology changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: Bugs
[16:35] <slangasek> bdmurray: not sure if there's anything this week since we're all mobiling?
[16:36] <ev> I thought it was more that gvariant lives off in its own excessively-optimised little world and that http://developer.gnome.org/gobject/stable/tools-refdb.html wouldn't work
[16:36] <slangasek> (not to be confused with moblining)
[16:36] <ev> but I haven't dug deep enough - I just ended up throwing in a convincing enough struct to check the refcounts manually
[16:36] <bdmurray> slangasek: I have not seen anything other than the carry over bug 1093819 from last week.  What is the next step there?
[16:36] <ogra_> something like https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-nexus7 ?
[16:36] <ubottu> bug 1093819 in Wubi "Wubi installed 12.10 amd64 without configuring i386" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1093819
[16:36] <ogra_> :)
[16:38] <slangasek> bdmurray: next step is to look at the build system for the wubi image and figure out if something is removing the file
[16:40] <slangasek> bdmurray: as I noted in the bug log, dpkg's postinst should work unconditionally on initial install
[16:41] <slangasek> bdmurray: can you carry that investigation forward, since you've been looking at it so far?
[16:41] <bdmurray> slangasek: looking at the build system?
[16:42] <slangasek> bdmurray: yes
[16:42] <bdmurray> slangasek: sure
[16:42] <slangasek> cheers
[16:42] <slangasek> bdmurray:
[16:42] <slangasek> oops, sorry
[16:42] <slangasek> [TOPIC] Mobile sprint
=== meetingology changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: Mobile sprint
[16:43] <slangasek> anybody want to say anything wrt the sprint that hasn't already been said?
[16:43] <slangasek> it sounds like things are going well
[16:43] <slangasek> we should have the desktop running in 640k of memory on the n7 by the end of the week, right? :)
[16:44]  * barry is having a flashback to 1981
[16:44] <cjwatson> It's certainly making me go through some truly elderly code
[16:45] <xnox> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Nexus7/raring-targets well are we at the second marker yet? with desktop + firefox + thunderbird under 1GB of RAM or not ?
[16:46] <cjwatson> Mm, it'd be nice to have those table cells coloured with assessments
[16:46] <slangasek> hmm, not sure
[16:46] <ogra_> ugh, thunderbird
[16:46] <cjwatson> I feel that I have very little idea of how much overall progress we're considered to have made
[16:46] <cjwatson> And how much remains
[16:46] <xnox> ogra_: it's not entirely clear if it's thunderbird or email webapp
[16:47] <slangasek> the web browser can take up 1GB on its own, so
[16:47] <ogra_> i hope its not thunderbird
[16:47] <ev> relax guys, I'm sure it's mutt
[16:47] <xnox> =)))))))
[16:47] <ogra_> with QML overlay ?
[16:47] <xnox> emacs what else does one need =)

=== meetingology changed the topic of #ubuntu-meeting to: AOB
[16:47] <slangasek> ;P
[16:48] <ogra_> heh
[16:48] <ev> I'm 29.
[16:48] <barry> xnox: emacs under 1gb?  not mine! :)
[16:48] <ev> ONE GOOD YEAR LEFT! :-P
[16:48] <ogra_> yeah, its over after that, let me tell you
[16:48] <ev> :D
[16:48] <jodh> ev: you'd better buy more tyres!
[16:48] <slangasek> ev: congrats :)
[16:48] <ogra_> its starts with your hair ... then your teeth ... and then the rest falls off

[16:49] <ev> g'aw
[16:49] <ogra_> but you grow a lot new stuff right above the hips though
[16:49] <slangasek> xnox: is that the royalty-free version? :)
[16:49] <ev> hahaha, this has suddenly taken a turn for the graphic
[16:49] <cjwatson> happy birthday :)
[16:49] <ev> thanks!
[16:49] <slangasek> yes, I have several teeth right above my hips now
[16:49] <xnox> slangasek: it's irc equiv. of singing the song =)
[16:49] <ogra_> happy b-day yeah :)
[16:49] <slangasek> they don't tell you that in the brochure
[16:49] <ev> might want to get that looked at
[16:49] <stgraber> happy birthday ev!
[16:49] <ev> thanks!
[16:49] <ogra_> LOL

[16:49] <cjwatson> ;-)
[16:50] <ev> hah!
[16:51] <slangasek> wow
[16:51] <ogra_> hey but at least it can run for 4h on battery !
[16:51] <barry> i'm sure they won't possibly get sued over that
[16:51] <xnox>  /o\
[16:52] <xnox> well I remember shaving off 7GB by stripping architectures off fat-binaries and languages translations from mac os x install...
