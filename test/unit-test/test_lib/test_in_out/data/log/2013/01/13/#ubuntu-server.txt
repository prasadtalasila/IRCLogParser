[00:04] <Super_Dog> OK... Looks like they gave me 3.6.3 on the 12.04 upgrade..
[00:05] <Super_Dog> 3.6.3 Samba that is.
[00:06] <Super_Dog> Gonna update and reboot...
[00:06] <Super_Dog> See if that helps...
[00:06] <freesbie> on 10.04 it was 3.4.7 so maybe you need to fix configs
[00:07] <freesbie> I dont see any reason to change to a newer version yet
[00:08] <Super_Dog> Thanks... I'll be checking the configs shortly after reboot.  This is my first boot from 10.04 to 12.04 and I'm typing on this hardware right now.  I recall saving my samba configuration during the upgrade process.

[21:04] <Bizzeh> hi, has i386 support been dropped in 12.10?
[21:05] <drag0nzz> hey guys, when i installed ubuntu 10 couple of years ago, i used to be able to access the server using FTP but now i installed the latest version of ubuntu server and i cannot ftp to it
[21:05] <drag0nzz> did someone change and i have to install an ftp server or something?
[21:07] <drag0nzz> anyone?
[21:08] <Bizzeh> ftpd has never been in ubuntu as default, you have always had to install one yourself
[21:08] <Bizzeh> you may be thinking about SSH
=== a|way is now known as alein
=== alein is now known as a|way
[21:09] <drag0nzz> Bizzeh, possible that i installed it when i first installed the OS without remembering, but im sure it wasnt SSH
[21:10] <drag0nzz> Bizzeh, what do you recommend if i want to access my server using FTP service?
[21:10] <drag0nzz> this is a local server and im the only one who uses it..
[21:10] <Bizzeh> drag0nzz, when your installing, you get asked what the server is going to be, one of the options is FTP, if you choose that, the installer will choose an ftpd for you
[21:10] <drag0nzz> so i want to be able to ftp to my user account and not to an ftp directory
[21:10] <drag0nzz> ah right
[21:10] <Bizzeh> most common are pureftp and proftpd, personal preference really
[21:10] <drag0nzz> what is the command to run that installer again?
[21:36] <qman__> drag0nzz, I recommend not using FTP for anything, ever, since SFTP is in all ways superior
[21:36] <qman__> Bizzeh, actual i386 was dropped after 10.04, as in the linux-386 kernel does not exist past that
[21:37] <qman__> ubuntu "i386" is actually i686
[21:37] <Bizzeh> yeah, i get that, server was still always labeled as i386 though, and there are no links to any server iso other than x64

[21:37] <Bizzeh> wondering if 32bit server has been binned
[21:37] <qman__> and can only be expected to run on Intel Pentium II or AMD K7+ chips
[21:38] <qman__> there are some pentium 1s with i686 but only a few
[21:38] <qman__> but I'm pretty sure 32-bit hasn't been dropped yet, looking now
[21:39] <qman__> yeah, it's still on the download page
[21:39] <qman__> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop - drop-down has 32 and 64 bit
[21:39] <Bizzeh> really? for 12.10 i only see 64bit for server
[21:39] <qman__> http://releases.ubuntu.com/12.10/ubuntu-12.10-server-i386.iso
[21:40] <qman__> for some reason the server drop down isn't there, but the image is
[21:40] <Bizzeh> thats why i was wondering
[21:41] <qman__> they probably just want to discourage use
[21:41] <Bizzeh> have a spare p4 with 2gb of ram at work, decided to use it to host diskless boot
[21:41] <qman__> if your hardware supports it, no reason to not use 64-bit, and hardware that doesn't will be getting too old in the near future
[21:42] <Bizzeh> was gonna go thin client, but, dont really wanna shell out thousands for a server powerful enough to host X and apps and everything required to run thin client for 50+ machines
[21:43] <Bizzeh> qman__: p4 doesnt support 64bit, if we had a 64bit cpu, i would use it, but we dont, and my boss is tighter than you can imagine
[21:44] <qman__> yeah
[21:44] <qman__> I'm actually running 32-bit on this system, but it was originally installed back in 2006, and things were different then
[21:45] <qman__> late P4s do suppport 64-bit
[21:45] <qman__> but only P4 extremes IIRC
[21:45] <patdk-lap> thought we where still on p4's
[21:46] <Bizzeh> no, the entire project branch of p4 was killed
[21:46] <Bizzeh> the intel core processors were based on the p3, which was actually far better than the p4
[21:46] <qman__> yep
[21:47] <qman__> they integrated some of the features they came up with for the P4, but the architecture has very little in common with them
[21:47] <qman__> netburst died
[21:47] <Bizzeh> the failure of the p4 over those 3 - 4 years is what allowed AMD to become a major player, creating competition, reducing prices
[21:47] <Bizzeh> so, even if you had the misfortune to buy one, it was a good thing
=== cpg|away is now known as cpg
[21:48] <qman__> intel had to intentionally cripple the P3 to get the P4 to sell
[21:48] <qman__> they purposely kept cache sizes too small
[21:48] <qman__> and xeons stayed on the P3 architecture well into the 1.4GHz range
[21:49] <Bizzeh> they released drivers that killed performance on p3's also, claiming it was required to increase performance for the p4
[21:49] <qman__> as did the mobile chips, they called them pentium Ms, but they were really just newer P3 chips
[21:54] <Bizzeh> hmmn, doing diskless boot, cant seem to get the client to use the X drivers to accelerate the gui. pissing me off now

[23:11] <JanC> define "pings correctly"
[23:12] <elkingrey> Well, then I issue the ping command from both my local machine and the server(VPS) I get the correct(new) IP
[23:12] <elkingrey> then = when
[23:12] <JanC> did you restart Thunderbird?
[23:12] <elkingrey> Yes
[23:13] <JanC> and does the server actually accept connections on the new IP address?
[23:13] <JanC> IMAP/POP connections, I mean
[23:13] <elkingrey> One sec, I'll show the error.
[23:14] <elkingrey> JanC: http://www.bpaste.net/show/YvA3b4BnYRCmfMrcIgYJ/
[23:15] <JanC> okay, so it's your outgoing mailserver
[23:15] <JanC> can you connect to it using telnet?
[23:15] <elkingrey> JanC: When I log into the server, I do so on the new ip address.
[23:15] <elkingrey> I cannot receive mail, either
[23:15] <elkingrey> JanC: I don't know how to connect using telnet.
[23:22] <elkingrey> JanC: Figured it out: http://www.bpaste.net/show/Kqb5fs1EiQzBv3eUpZPb/ And that's the new ip
[23:23] <JanC> so, the server refuses connections to the mailserver...
[23:24] <JanC> did you update your firewall rusles to the new IP address?
[23:24] <JanC> rules
[23:25] <elkingrey> Hmm, I was under the impression my firewall was disabled. Let me look into that. I have to figure out how to configure it again. It's been forever since I played with it.
[23:25] <JanC> I'd say, check firewall config & mailserver config & check if the mailserver is actually running

[23:26] <sw> elkingrey: using iptables?
[23:30] <elkingrey> sw: I only partialy built my server, the rest was done by somebody else. I don't know.
[23:30] <elkingrey> I would say yes.
[23:31] <sw> elkingrey: $ iptables -L
[23:31] <elkingrey> one sec
[23:32] <elkingrey> sw: http://www.bpaste.net/show/leXvEDwosXGXBECkfC2e/
[23:36] <sw> elkingrey: so your server is blocking everything apart from established/related connections, http, https and ssh?
[23:36] <sw> elkingrey: what's your servers IP address?
[23:37] <elkingrey> sw: 199.48.69.232
[23:38] <sw> elkingrey: you said you had mail server issues right?
[23:38] <elkingrey> yeah
[23:39] <elkingrey> two minutes before you asked me that I played with disable ufw, and then enable ufw. Don't know whether or not it was enabled to begin with or if I screwed things up.
[23:40] <sw> elkingrey: you probably want to allow IMAP/POP3/SMTP then, as all of those ports are blocked
[23:40] <elkingrey> sw: I don't know how they got blocked.
[23:41] <elkingrey> sw: Or how to allow them
[23:41] <sw> elkingrey: $ ufw allow 143/tcp; ufw allow 110/tcp; ufw allow 25/tcp
[23:42] <elkingrey> sw: BTW, my thunderbird mail client is set up so that I receive mail on port 995 and send on port 587
[23:42] <sw> elkingrey: also you should decide whether you are going to use iptables or ufw, as looking at your paste there is a mixture and things can get messy when using different interfaces to manage it
[23:43] <elkingrey> sw: ufw may have been disabled originally, and I just enabled it a few minutes ago. Really, I don't know what I'm doing.
[23:43] <elkingrey> sw: Let me disable ufw and then those to the iptables -L
[23:43] <sw> elkingrey: then you'll want to allow those ports too using the method above
[23:43] <sw> elkingrey: if you're not experienced then I would suggest using and sticking to ufw as it tends to sort everything out for you and simplifies things
[23:44] <elkingrey> sw: How does this look now that I've disabled ufw? http://www.bpaste.net/show/EbfNiKJ6eVEm72YA1lc5/
[23:46] <elkingrey> sw: Hmm, does this mean its settings aren't changed until startup, or they are changed immediately? Firewall stopped and disabled on system startup
[23:46] <sw> elkingrey: I'm not sure, it depends on what you want. though if you aren't the original person who set it up then I'd recommend clearing the tables, and starting a fresh so that you learn something along the way
[23:46] <sw> elkingrey: if you're using iptables then nothing is saved unless you sort that out yourself. ufw should handle that though
[23:46] <elkingrey> sw: What command should I issue now, to allow ports 995 and 587?
=== mike is now known as Guest39197
[23:48] <elkingrey> sw: Alright, I'll re enable ufw, then issue the command to open up the ports and see what happens
[23:48] <sw> elkingrey: seriously though, I would clearing everything, reading the documentation and starting again. you're going to get yourself in to all sorts of mess doing this without understanding what you're doing. for e.g. iptables are read from top to bottom, you're allow rules should be at the top and deny rules at the bottom. you're going to get yourself locked out etc. until you really understand what you're doing
[23:49] <sw> elkingrey: this is a good page to read if you're new to firewalls: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW
[23:50] <sw> elkingrey: iptables are not saved unless you sort that out yourself. so for e.g. you have deny rules handled by ufw and allow rules handled by native iptables at the moment. on restart, your allow rules will be lost but the ufw deny rules will be reloaded meaning you could get locked out etc.
[23:51] <fluteamahoot> So I can't connect to Maas...
[23:52] <fluteamahoot> and google has failed me
[23:52] <elkingrey> sw: I don't know how to start from scratch.
[23:53] <sw> elkingrey: $ iptables --flush, maybe
[23:56] <elkingrey> sw: Do you know if there is any way I can find out what the status of ufw was before I started tinkering?
[23:59] <sw> elkingrey: what do you mean status?
