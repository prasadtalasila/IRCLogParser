[01:19] <caligari> good night people
[01:20] <caligari> I dont know if this is the right channel: I can't download packages from http://ppa.launchpad.net/ui-toolkit
[01:21] <caligari> There is some kind of problem with server (QML toolkit): 404 not found
[01:23] <TheLordOfTime> the 404 suggests there's not packages
[01:24] <TheLordOfTime> forgive me for asking, caligari, but which ubuntu are you on?
[01:24] <TheLordOfTime> (which release)
[01:24] <TheLordOfTime> (or are you on dev :P)
[01:25] <caligari> precise
[01:25] <TheLordOfTime> caligari, the PPA you mention, is it this one?  https://launchpad.net/~ui-toolkit/+archive/ppa
[01:25] <caligari> it is the qml toolkit preview: http://developer.ubuntu.com/get-started/gomobile/
[01:26] <caligari> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ui-toolkit/ppa
[01:26] <TheLordOfTime> ppa:ui-toolkit/ppa  -> translates to the PPA I linked.
[01:26] <TheLordOfTime> caligari, that PPA only publishes for Quantal
[01:26] <caligari> OMG! :(
[01:26] <TheLordOfTime> https://launchpad.net/~ui-toolkit/+archive/ppa/+packages  <-- you'll see only Quantal stuff on that list
[01:27] <TheLordOfTime> it may be a good idea to make a note of that on the site, devs ;)
[01:27] <caligari> thank you for assist me :)
[01:27]  * TheLordOfTime returns to bug triaging
[01:28] <caligari> yes it is a good idea ;)

[08:53] <nrosvall> I know this might not be the right channel to ask this, but as I asked on another channel: [10:51] <nrosvall> I'm a long time Windows developer and I'm just about to start developing an application for Ubuntu. Now with this new Ubuntu Phone and coming Ubuntu sdk. Is it still recommened to use gtk and python as mentioned in developer.ubuntu.com? Or should I go for c++ and qt? Or is it just
[08:53] <nrosvall> too early to think about the phone?
[08:57] <andyrock> nrosvall, i'd go with c++/qt/qml
[08:57] <andyrock> ;)
[08:58] <nrosvall> I think I will yes
[09:07] <Tm_T> nrosvall: go with c++/qt/qml and you do cross-platform (:
[09:07] <nrosvall> mm true
[10:05] <tjaalton> so, how do I figure out who to discuss with the rejection of an upload to -proposed?
[10:07] <xnox> tjaalton: which upload? and usually they all hang out on #-release
[10:08] <tjaalton> xnox: sssd to precise-proposed
[10:08] <tjaalton> got rejected last friday
[10:10] <tjaalton> joined -release, we can disuss it there
[10:16] <xnox> tjaalton: the only nit-picking i can spot, is absence of matching quantal SRU for  the two bugs affecting it.
[10:18] <tjaalton> xnox: ok, I guess it got rejected due to the new upstream version, bugfix or not
[10:19] <xnox> tjaalton: well, are all changes present documented in the bugs? you can open an extra bug "remaining changes in this micropoint release"
[10:19] <tjaalton> xnox: that's bug 1086304
[10:19] <ubottu> bug 1086304 in sssd (Ubuntu Precise) "new upstream bugfix release from the LTM branch" [High,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1086304
[10:20] <tjaalton> which should explain the rest of the diff
[10:20] <xnox> awesome.
[10:21] <xnox> infinity: based on my logs, was it you who rejected sssd on 28th of December? ^
[10:27] <tjaalton> I'll prepare the update to quantal
[10:29] <tjaalton> xnox: now I noticed that the changelog didn't mention the meta-bug.. my bad

[12:01] <hrw> hi
[12:13] <sourav> hi all, any idea when it will be available
[12:18] <cjwatson> "it" is a bit vague but I suspect you want #ubuntu-phone

=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[12:55] <hrw> doko: I took a look at 'cameleon' ftfbs. With rebuild of 'lablgtk-extras' and installing resulting packages it started building
[12:58] <hrw> doko: but as I have no idea on ocalm stuff I prefer to not do upload to force such rebuild
[13:13] <sonne> greetings! is this the right place to ask about packaging for ppas?

=== lamont` is now known as lamont
[14:26] <micahg> doko: for icedtea-web, is there a reason why default-jdk isn't used instead of openjdk-6-jdk?  in raring, the current packaging produces a JRE headless 7 with JDK 6, switching to default-jdk gives version 7 of both
[14:41] <apw> doko, fyi the linux build on armhf in your rebuild archive blew an internal compiler error
