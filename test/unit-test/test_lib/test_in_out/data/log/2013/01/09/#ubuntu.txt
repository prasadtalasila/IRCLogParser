[00:00] <KI4RO> Anyone know how to turn on the voice over feature in an IPOD thru UBUNTU?
[00:00] <KaRmA> can anyone tell me why my proftpd server on ubuntu would disconnect for no apparent reason? I am able to log right back in and I have all the timeouts set really high...
[00:00] <paco1> hello masters!
[00:01] <KaRmA> paco1, hello slave
[00:01] <makuto> When I attempt to execute the .desktop file (using the dash) nothing happens. The command I'm trying to get it to run is 'xterm -e "~/path/to/executable" ' (without single quotes)
[00:01] <jrib> makuto: what's in your .desktop file?
[00:02] <makuto> jrib: http://pastebin.com/NHCuHesp
[00:02] <ActionParsnip> KaRmA: is the service running?
[00:03] <makuto> The command doesn't work in the terminal either, so I think that's the main problem
[00:03] <dcope> hey all, i have ubuntu 12.04 on a macbook air. when i close the lid the apple stays on. any fix?
[00:03] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, yea..... my problem is it disconnects after a minute or so even though the proftpd config file tells it not to .
[00:03] <jrib> makuto: heh, try gnome-terminal instead of xterm
[00:03] <KaRmA> ActionParsnip, sending 'NOOP' or keep alive, keeps it alive....
[00:03] <KaRmA> so I guess ill just have to do that :-\ not sure why though.
[00:04] <KaRmA> my ssh never disconnects
[00:04] <M13> hello
[00:04] <M13> is there anyone here that is good with syslinux?
[00:04] <paco1> i have a question: if it exist a tool to analyse the session of a user?
[00:05] <LinSven> How do I delete/purge old kernels? I was asked for homework to write a one line cmd that gets rid of all the old ones.
[00:06] <makuto> jrib: That worked better, but I get this error: Failed to execute child process "~/Development/gameDev/oneDayTilemap/tileEditor" (No such file or directory)
[00:06] <jrib> makuto: don't use ~
[00:06] <makuto> jrib: Alright. Also, I found it isn't where I thought it was, dumb mistake :)
[00:06] <KI4RO> LinSven, OS-uninstaller does the trick
[00:07] <ActionParsnip> LinSven:  dpkg -l | awk {'print $2'} | grep linux-image | grep -v `uname -r` | grep -v linux-image-generic        lists the excess kernels
[00:08] <jrib> makuto: also, you might look more into .desktop files. Some have "Terminal=true" and that may be more correct to use
=== naughx is now known as Naughx
[00:08] <LinSven> ActionParsnip thank you. I was looking at this cmd but yours seems better. sudo apt-get remove $(dpkg -l|egrep '^ii  linux-(im|he)'|awk '{print $2}'|grep -v `uname -r`)
[00:08] <ActionParsnip> LinSven: you can use backticks to then use it with apt-get
[00:09] <jrib> makuto: run this for some examples (and I'd also check the spec online): grep -r -i terminal=true /usr/share/applications
[00:09] <ActionParsnip> LinSven:  sudo apt-get --purge remove `dpkg -l | awk {'print $2'} | grep linux-image | grep -v `uname -r` | grep -v linux-image-generic`
[00:09] <makuto> jrib: Ah, that did the trick! Thanks tons!
[00:09] <LinSven> Oh thx. Really new to this stuff. Installed Ubuntu today for a class we are having.
[00:10] <LinSven> Must say I like the idea of free software. Not because of the money but the idea.
[00:10] <ActionParsnip> LinSven: you have the knowledge (awk, grep. etc) That's all your tutor is really wanting you to demonstrate
[00:10] <jonjo> ActionParsnip: ever had 'locked' when transfering a movie and trying to play it?
[00:10] <makuto> jrib: And I understand the grep command, brilliant way to show me that. Thanks a lot!
[00:10] <Ben64> I don't use it for the money or the idea, I use it because it works better for me
[00:10] <LinSven> ActionParsnip yeah that was the idea I think.
[00:10] <ActionParsnip> jonjo: no, I use my sftp server and transfer that way.
[00:11] <teslas_moustache> got it. The files in that directory were all empty anyway. I don't know why it wasn't created automatically, but my files should be popping up in /tmp/restore pretty soon. Thanks for the deceptively simple advice.

[00:20] <brightspark> I checked on mine- it's not in the repos on Maverick, but that doesn't mean much.
[00:20] <devnull_> well why don't you search the repos for 12.10 then

[00:21] <KyleYankan> Hey #ubuntu, I have a question. I'm trying to connect my Canon 50D (which doesn't support USB Mass storage) to get some images off. Shotwell sees the camera, but says it's locked by another application. No other image applications are open. I do get a weird error wehn I plug the camera in, with no applications open: "Error initializing camera: -1: Unspecified error"
[00:21] <bentinata> hello
[00:22] <brightspark> devnull_, does that involve fiddling with the sources file?
[00:22] <brightspark> ActionParsnip, yep; I noticed that.

[00:22] <brightspark> ActionParsnip, however, aptitude still lists packages for download.

[00:23] <hydruid> I am having issues running a bash script, when I wget it from Github it won't run, but when I manually create it everything is fine......what causes that?
[00:23] <usr13> KyleYankan: Maybe just take the memory card out and use a card reader?
[00:23] <devnull_> hydruid, is it executable ?
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[00:24] <brightspark> devnull_, correct
[00:24] <hydruid> devnull_: it's a .sh
[00:24] <devnull_> brightspark, then search ubuntus repo for the latest version and see if it is a listed package
[00:24] <Ben64> cinnamon isn't in ubuntu
[00:24] <hydruid> devnull_: both methods I did a chmod +x script.sh before trying to run it
[00:24] <KyleYankan> usr13: No card readers
[00:24] <devnull_> hydruid, what do you mean by ... wont run
[00:25] <usr13> KyleYankan: I don't know about you, but my laptop and desktop both have build-in card readers.
[00:25] <hydruid> devnull_: it comes up with a random error, seems like it's saying there was a line error after a space
[00:25] <KyleYankan> usr13: My laptop has a SD card reader, but the 50D takes CF cards.
[00:25] <KyleYankan> Pro cameras usually do :-/
[00:25] <Naughx> Maybe it's already mounted somewhere else.
[00:25] <devnull_> hydruid, okay ... so it does run ... it just has an error
[00:25] <usr13> KyleYankan: Well, card readers are pretty low priced, probably abuot $10 or less.
[00:26] <bluebeat09> hey! can someone help me plz?
[00:26] <hydruid> devnull_: yes I can pastebin it if you want
[00:26] <devnull_> hydruid, no thank you
[00:26] <usr13> KyleYankan: When I bought my digital camera, that was the first thing I ordered and have kept it in my camera bag since then so that I always have easy access.
[00:27] <hydruid> devnull_: this is the error it gives, https://raw.github.com/hydruid/zenoss/master/install.sh
[00:27] <hydruid> oops
[00:27] <KyleYankan> usr13: Yeah, I just normally use a windows computer, but I'm currently away from any of my regular equipment
[00:27] <KyleYankan> I personally don't find a card reader necessary for my work
[00:27] <hydruid> devnull_: this is the error it gives:  Syntax error: end of file unexpected (expecting "then")
[00:27] <usr13> KyleYankan: Well, doesn't matter if it's windows or linux.
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[00:28] <KyleYankan> usr13: The camera works fine on windows. I'm booting into it now to get the images I need
[00:28] <bluebeat09> can i restore ubuntu 12.10? like if it was just installed?
[00:28] <usr13> KyleYankan: There is always the possibility that some setting on the camera is blocking it.  Hard to tell from where I sit :)
[00:28] <jonjo> this ubuntu / andoid isb link sucks
[00:28] <devnull_> bluebeat09, restore what ?
[00:28] <evbogue> Ask #Ubuntu: What's the first app you install on a fresh Ubuntu install?
[00:28] <dr_willis> bluebeat09: user settings are easy to restore. system can be harder
[00:28] <ActionParsnip> bluebeat09: you can remove the configs in $HOME and get vanilla settings for apps, the things outside that will need a little more work
[00:29] <devnull_> jonjo ...   what are you trugudsknidgjj to say
[00:29] <usr13> KyleYankan: There is probably a way to access it, I would guess it is something simple, but without more info, we wouldn't be able to tell what it is.
[00:29] <dr_willis> evbogue:  poll in #ubuntu-offtopic
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> jonjo: its the single storage thing. its a bit weird
[00:29] <brightspark> devnull_, ok thanks.  finally found it.
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> jonjo: I just transfer data over the wifi and its fine
[00:29] <devnull_> hydruid, i guess you are going to learn about bash scripting today
[00:29] <KyleYankan> usr13: Not sure what to tell you. There's no lock on the camera. I'll do some more googling
[00:30] <jonjo> its too slow
[00:30] <devnull_> brightspark, yea ... they have the repos online so you can check that kind of stuff
[00:30] <bluebeat09> i installed gnome shell from u soft center, then i deleted it from there too, but now when i power up in the login screen is different, i just want to go back to the way it was
[00:30] <jonjo> what wifi speeds do you get ActionParsnip ?
[00:30] <bluebeat09> i know its not a problem+
[00:30] <bluebeat09> but i would like to do that
[00:30] <bluebeat09> i cant seem to get it right+
[00:30] <ActionParsnip> jonjo: not sure exactly, moves fast enough
[00:30] <devnull_> bluebeat ... ps ax | grep gdm  ... is gdm listed or lightgdm ?
[00:30] <nimo> can you uninstall pulse and still get audio ?
[00:30] <hydruid> devnull_: I think i just figured it out, looks like it added the dreaded ^M at the end of each line, removed them and that resovled the issue
[00:30] <usr13> KyleYankan: YOu could bring up a terminal and type   tail -f /var/log/syslog  and hit enter and watch as you  plug it in to see what clues you get.
[00:30] <tompa> Hello, i just updated my graphic drivers for my Asus Gtx 560ti card. But now after reboot everything lost its sharp. It feels like i run everything in a lower resolution (lower than 1080) even if system settings/display says it is in 1080p ... Someone who knows what to do?
[00:30] <dr_willis> bluebeat09:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure lghtdm
[00:31] <brightspark> devnull_, I thought I might have to edit my sources and have aptitude pull the list that way.  Glad I didn't have to.
[00:31] <devnull_> hydruid, that would do it
[00:31] <dr_willis> bluebeat09:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
[00:31] <ActionParsnip> tompa: change refresh rate maybe
[00:31] <bluebeat09> ok will try this  sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
[00:31] <KyleYankan> Got it. Had to rub gphoto2 from the command line. It seemed that the connected would rapidly disconnect after connecting. So executing a `gphoto2 --get-all-files

[00:32] <jonjo> maybe it is the flash commit speed on the nexus which is the problem
[00:33] <KyleYankan> Thanks
[00:33] <tompa> actionparsnip where can i find refresh rate options?
[00:33] <usr13> KyleYankan: I've had my camera for YEARS and never plugged it into a computer.  I've always just pulled out the chip and put in the PC.

[00:34] <dcope> is there a way to mimic os x mouse settings on ubuntu?
[00:34] <devnull_> dcope what are OS X's mouse settings ?
[00:34] <devnull_> ive never used it
[00:34] <Naughx> @Usr; SD / SDHC are so much better :P
[00:35] <usr13> dcope: Not sure why you would want to.
[00:35] <dcope> devnull_: no idea, but i've put mouse sensitivy and acceleration at 0 and my mouse is still flinging around the screen
[00:35] <Ben64> devnull_: you hover over the icon and if OSX wants you to, it'll launch
[00:35] <dcope> i just need to slow it down
[00:35] <bluebeat09> i dont remeber who gave me the code but it worked+
[00:35] <bluebeat09> thx a lot
[00:35] <brightspark> dcope, is there a different tab for touchpad vs mouse?
[00:35] <devnull_> bluebeat09, <dr_willis>
[00:36] <dcope> brightspark: no, just a different "Input" dropdown. i'm using xfce
[00:36] <bluebeat09> right. thx dr_willis, simple solution
[00:36] <brightspark> dcope, ah sorry.  good luck.
[00:38] <devnull_> dcope,   usb/ps2 ?
[00:38] <dcope> devnull_: bluetooth
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[00:39] <tompa> devnull_ ben64 actionparsnip i changed resolution and changed it back and then it worked ... thank you!
[00:39] <devnull_> dcope, oh .. i have never used any bluetooth devices ... not sure if there are any issues with them
[00:39] <devnull_> tompa, glad it works
[00:40] <devnull_> dcope its possible you have to change the sensitivity somewhere else
[00:40] <dcope> interesting
[00:41] <devnull_> or maybe xfce isn't setting it correctly ... havent used xfce in a lil while
[00:41] <Awolf> hello
[00:41] <dcope> devnull_: it's interesting because it works with the trackpad but not the mouse

[00:42] <devnull_> dcope, it is bypassing those settings ... maybe it needs to be adjusted at the X level
[00:43] <Awolf> 0xc00000e9
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[00:43] <Ben64> Awolf: you should install windows first
[00:44] <devnull_> yea windows 7 doesn't play nice nice with partitions especially with linux on themn
[00:44] <Awolf> is there no turn around ?
[00:44] <Awolf> it took me a real long while to install linux and its updates :@
[00:45] <tentaclemoose> howdy folks, has anyone here had problems with 2wire(ATT) routers and linux?
[00:45] <tentaclemoose> *ubuntu
[00:46] <Ben64> Awolf: i don't know that much about windows7 install
[00:46] <Ben64> i just know it doesn't like linux at all
[00:46] <Orphis> How can I resolve windows hostnames from linux?
[00:46] <devnull_> Orphis, did you check google
[00:46] <Naughx> Yes, windows bootloader overwrites grub...
[00:46] <Orphis> devnull_: Yes, and it doesn't work
[00:47] <ActionParsnip> Awolf: what does the stop code mean?
[00:47] <Awolf> i dont mind the overwriting section i can refix grub with boot-repair
[00:47] <Orphis> devnull_: I've installed winbind and added wins to nsswitch and names can't be resolved
[00:47] <Naughx> I know, but it's just annying.
[00:47] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: could use hosts file in windows. I've configured Ubuntu to state its hostname to the router but i can't remember
[00:47] <Orphis> devnull_: My Ubuntu machine can be resolved from windows though
[00:48] <devnull_> samba ?
[00:48] <Orphis> ActionParsnip: I haven't put anything in the hosts file, it's 2012, we can autodiscover most things now
[00:48] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: in /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf
[00:48] <Orphis> devnull_: Yes, samba is installed with nmbd to provide a name
[00:48] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: Its actually 2013.
[00:48] <Orphis> ActionParsnip: I'm lagging a little :P
[00:49] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: change: send host-name "<hostname>"
[00:49] <Naughx> Yes... 8 days now...
[00:49] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: to:   send host-name "actualsystemnamehere"
[00:49] <Awolf> ActionParsnip windows disk cant find the partitioned section for it i guess
[00:49] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: if you're going to have an attitude about it, at least be precise
[00:49] <Awolf> even though i did partition it into ntfs form and set it to bootable
=== carlos is now known as Guest66226
[00:50] <{messedupmatthew> can someone help me  with my broadcom driver for my wifi?
[00:50] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: if the server is on static IP then hosts file is dead handy, saves having to quiz the router for something which will neve change
[00:50] <Orphis> ActionParsnip: Resolving the name from elsewhere in the network works just fine, why would changing the dhclient.conf config change anything?
[00:50] <devnull_> idk matthew how about some more details ...
[00:51] <FLeiXiuS> Anyone familiar with preseeds and late/success commands for 12.04?
[00:51] <Orphis> I'm trying to resolve a name from the linux box, there's no dhcp config there
[00:51] <devnull_> awolf is the partition logical ?
[00:51] <Orphis> (well, there is, but it isn't used for resolving winbind names really)
[00:51] <devnull_> i think windows will only install to a primary partition
[00:51] <{messedupmatthew> i am xubuntu and it says to go to the desktop menu system administration additional drivers and i cant find it?
[00:52] <devnull_> {messedupmatthew,  i don't know what software xubuntu comes with ... look for jockey in the software center
[00:52] <{messedupmatthew> jockey ok will do
[00:52] <Awolf> how can i know if it is primary or logical
[00:53] <Awolf> ?
[00:53] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: it makes the Ubuntu OS publish it's name to the router, if you look now it will only show an IP and a Mac address
[00:53] <devnull_> what version of ubuntu matthew ?
[00:53] <Awolf> let me try something now
[00:53] <{messedupmatthew> 12.04 i believe
[00:53] <devnull_> awolf ... well then i think you better read through some tutorials first
[00:53] <Awolf> be right back
[00:53] <ActionParsnip> Awolf: you will need to delete the partition then convert to extended, then make logical partitions
[00:53] <Orphis> ActionParsnip: I know what it does, and it's not used at all for netbios / bonjour (avahi) protocols at all
[00:53] <Awolf> ok ill do that now
[00:54] <Orphis> ActionParsnip: It's mostly used if you want the dhcp server to identify machines on the network with names instead of mac address
[00:54] <devnull_> i would imagine windows wants a primary partition because bootloaders have to be on primary partitions
[00:55] <Awolf> any suggestions as to what program i should use to partition correctly
[00:55] <Awolf> ?
[00:55] <ActionParsnip> Awolf: gparted
[00:55] <devnull_> gparted
[00:55] <devnull_> Awolf, i would read some tutorials on installing windows7 after ubuntu is already installed ... you will lose grub
[00:56] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: by default, the name of the Ubuntu system will not be in your router. you need to make that change and reboot (or maybe just restart networking)
[00:56] <Awolf> devnull, I can refix grub by re-inserting the live cd and installing and running boot-repair from the live cd
[00:56] <Orphis> ActionParsnip: The name doesn't need to be in the router!!! I'm not trying to have DNS resolves, but wins!
[00:56] <ActionParsnip> Awolf: you will lose grub after installing Windows, but you can boot to Ubuntu liveCD and reinstate Grub to the MBR
[00:57] <rk0n> When using unity, the sound manager allows me to set the sound beyond 100%, but with KDE I don't have that option. And the sound is very low, any idea how to access that extra volume with KDE?
[00:57] <devnull_> awolf  ... that isnt the problem its your partitioning .. you should probably read up on what windows installer is looking for
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> rk0n: tried in alsamixer?
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: no idea then
[00:57] <ActionParsnip> Orphis: maybe others can advise
[00:58] <rk0n> ActionParsnip, yes, everything in alsamixer is 100%
[00:58] <Naughx> Yes, this is easy with grub-install

[00:58] <Awolf> devnull_ will do
[00:58] <ActionParsnip> rk0n: tried in #kubuntu as well?

[01:02] <wabash> Or do I need to go to adobe site?
=== puff is now known as puff``
[01:02] <Riley88> webash u can choose to include flash by default
=== puff`` is now known as puff```
[01:02] <devnull_> wabash, there is open flash and proprietary flash
=== puff``` is now known as puff
[01:03] <wbf> excuse me but I need to use minecraft on my ARM based ubuntu setup. any suggestions?
[01:03] <dr_willis> the tools in the repos download flash for you
[01:03] <wabash> devnull_: Does "open flash" work with linux well? Can you give me an example of it?
[01:03] <devnull_> Riley88, that is sweet .. im still trying to get my fingerprint reader and my subwoofer functioning
[01:03] <ActionParsnip> Webu: i use chrome, works well
[01:03] <Riley88> lol
[01:03] <Riley88> mine is a newer asus
[01:03] <devnull_> newer hp dv6
[01:04] <devnull_> wabash, no i can't give an example ... it is flashplayer
[01:04] <Riley88> flash isnt really an issue on linux anymore
[01:04] <Orphis> ActionParsnip: Turns out that host is DNS only, and ping uses NSS. Thus it was working all along (if only I had used the right command to check the result)
[01:04] <devnull_> unless your on 64bit ?
[01:04] <wbf> mine is a compaq presario CQ-60 and my other is an ARM-based UG802 running ubuntu
[01:04] <Riley88> unless your on some weird oss only distro
[01:04] <dr_willis> ive no issues with flash on 64bit.
[01:05] <wabash> Riley88: devnull_:  Excellent to hear.
[01:05] <dr_willis> and i know 32bit users that have huge flash issues
[01:05] <wabash> Riley88: devnull_:  Is "open flash" the name of the codecs? Or is it a name for something else?
[01:05] <devnull_> dr_willis, ... i thought it was the old had to have 32bit browser for flash .. i guess they released 64b version
[01:05] <Riley88> its just adobe flash player
[01:05] <wbf> dr_willis, can you help me with my LWJGL problem?
[01:05] <wabash> Riley88: But it's open?
[01:05] <devnull_> wabash, its not open flash .... open as opposed to propietary
[01:06] <dr_willis> devnull_: i dont even know qhat one im using.
[01:06] <wabash> devnull_: Riley88: Right. so if I wanted to install this... what should I search for?
[01:06] <dr_willis> wbf:  no idea what lwjgl means
[01:06] <wabash> This is not "gnash" or anything messed up like that, is it?
[01:06] <devnull_> dr_willis, cool ... that means it isn't a problem ... good to hear ... i might change over to 64bit
[01:06] <Riley88> adobe flash player in the software centor
[01:06] <devnull_> wabash, idk why don't you check
[01:06] <dr_willis> wabash:  use the flash installer tools in the repos and hope it works
[01:07] <Riley88> or ubuntu restricted extras if u want dvd and mp3 codecs to
[01:07] <wbf> Who here knows about the Lightweight W (don't know what w stands for) Java Game Libary?
[01:07] <devnull_> never heard of it
[01:07] <wbf> Do you play minecraft on linux? runs off that
[01:07] <wabash> Riley88: Thank you. So "adobe flash player" is open flash, I can assume, because it's in a Ubuntu repo?
[01:07] <devnull_> no or i probably would have heard of it
[01:08] <devnull_> wabash, no
[01:08] <memand> Hey guys, I think I did somthing bad. I was messing around in the tty1 terminal (I don't know what it is actually called) and was trying to get back to my graphical interface. I ended up rebooting the machine, but now when I type my password at login it just briefly flashes some terminal that I dont have time to read and sends me back to the login screen
[01:08] <dr_willis> wabash:  there no opensoueced flash that ive seen that works well
[01:08] <Riley88> yes its not open flash its just adobe flash player
[01:08] <memand> now I'm stuck in tty mode :/
[01:08] <Riley88> gnash was kind of good
[01:08] <Riley88> is that even still updated
[01:08] <devnull_> memand, what did you do to make it reboot .... alt+ctrl+delete ?
[01:09] <dr_willis> there are flash downloader tools and flash replacer extensions you can use in the browsers for videos on some sites
[01:09] <devnull_> i think if you install chrome it will install its own flash plugin
[01:09] <memand> devnull: yes
[01:09] <wabash> devnull_: dr_willis, Riley88: thank you. So long story short -- to get flash on Ubuntu, I can find it in one of the repositories? I.E., I don't have to go to adobe's site directly?
[01:10] <devnull_> memand, alt+ctrl+ F7 to get back to X
[01:10] <Riley88> yes wabash
[01:10] <devnull_> wabash, no .. the package will get flash from adobe for you i believe
[01:10] <dr_willis> wabash:  i said warlier. the tools in the repos download it from adobe for you
[01:10] <dr_willis> !flash
[01:10] <ubottu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - See also  !Restricted and !Gnash
[01:10] <KI4RO> Anyone know how to turn on the voice over feature in an IPOD thru UBUNTU?
[01:10] <TheLordOfTime> wabash, the package in the repositories will download it from adobe and install it, since the source for  flash is closed the package can't contain the actual code (but it can download it)
[01:11] <devnull_> KI4RO, i don't even know what that is
[01:11] <memand> devnull: nice thanks, I did not know that, but it will still not log me in for some reason
[01:11] <TheLordOfTime> devnull_, if you have no idea, don't respond, just a tidbit of advice ;)
[01:11] <KI4RO> devnull_, Okay LOL
[01:11] <dr_willis> ubuntu cant even include the flash download due to silly licensing
[01:11] <memand> devnull_: nice thanks, I did not know that, but it will still not log me in for some reason
[01:11] <Riley88> what are u talking about its in the installer
[01:11] <TheLordOfTime> KI4RO, i've never heard of that being done, but someone else may be able to.  Patience might be needed before you get an answer though.
[01:12] <wabash> TheLordOfTime: Interesting. Does it do a gpg check?
[01:12] <TheLordOfTime> wabash, uh, what?
[01:12] <KI4RO> TheLordOfTime, Thanks...been asking all throughout the day...we'll see
[01:12] <TheLordOfTime> wabash, i'm going to let dr_willis explain the package if you have such questions, apparently i need to poke something up in priority somewhere.
[01:12]  * TheLordOfTime disappears for a bit
[01:12] <devnull_> TheLordOfTime, maybe i want to know what it is so i can try and help
[01:13] <wabash> dr_willis: ?
[01:13] <dr_willis> wabash: ??
[01:13] <devnull_> wabash, just install the package
[01:13] <Riley88> for real lol
[01:14] <Riley88> sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin
[01:14] <Riley88> or is it just flashplugin
[01:14] <devnull_> KI4RO, the last i checked ... almost 2 years ago ... IPODs were a pain to deal with
[01:14] <dr_willis> apt-cache search flash installer
[01:14] <dr_willis> i think
=== josh_234 is now known as agliodbs
[01:15] <devnull_> flashplugin-installer
[01:15] <devnull_> on 12.10
[01:15] <KI4RO> devnull_, Still are LOL
[01:15] <devnull_> i don't understand what you are trying to do though
[01:16] <KI4RO> devnull_, You asking me?
[01:16] <devnull_> yea
[01:17] <KI4RO> devnull_, I have the IPOD shuffle and there is a feature available called voice over that will announce the name of the artist and the song once you get it turned on
[01:17] <devnull_> so what does that have to do with ubuntu ?
[01:17] <demonio> hi all I have a problem
[01:17] <devnull_> KI4RO, okay .. i think i gotcha
[01:18] <demonio> i have got a double boot
[01:18] <KI4RO> devnull_, I'm asking if anyone has found an Ubuntu app that might allow you to access and turn on the feature
[01:18] <devnull_> KI4RO, your trying to set settings on your device from Ubuntu ?
[01:18] <KI4RO> devnull_, Yep
[01:18] <devnull_> there is a program .. i can't remember what it is called that will let you rip music off of an IPOD .. it might be able to communicate with it
[01:18] <demonio> linux and win7, but linux is the first to start, how can i change that?
[01:19] <KI4RO> devnull_, I have ITuNES7 running under WINE but apparently WINE can't "see" any USB devices
[01:19] <tarelerulz> Any of you have any know how when it comes to MiroHDHC card? I have it hooked in with USB card reader and SD card adapter pluged into it .  It says 10mbs ,but it doing 7-8mb .   What could be problem
[01:19] <HonestAbe> change the menu.list in grub demonio
[01:19] <HonestAbe> one sec
[01:19] <devnull_> KI4RO, it might not be that it can't see the device it might be that the device is unrecognized to linux
[01:19] <HonestAbe> that's probably not the actual name of the file
[01:19] <dr_willis> bbl
[01:20] <KI4RO> devnull_, Either way, I can't get there from here LOL.   BTW there is a program called gtkpod, but it doesn't seem able to access the features of the IPOD
[01:20] <ElectricPrism> Is anyone here up and running from the Ubuntu Mini install? (38mbs) ?
[01:20] <ActionParsnip> ElectricPrism: indeed
[01:21] <devnull_> KI4RO, thats the program ... you may want to check wine information to setup usb correctly ...
[01:21] <demonio> is anyone here that can help me to set grub?
[01:21] <demonio> or mbr
[01:21] <devnull_> tarelerulz, so you are only 2mbs off ?
[01:21] <huttala> Does anyone have any idea how I can get the GUI working for my ubuntu 12.04 installation on a AMD APU laptop? I keep getting "Error no screens found" all the time, even tho I've installed the ATI drivers and they seem to be working
[01:22] <ActionParsnip> devnull_: thats what I thought....
[01:22] <KI4RO> devnull_, I have and it seems to be a known issues...they suggest setting Virtual box or some such
[01:22] <devnull_> demonio, someone is currently answering you
[01:22] <ElectricPrism> ActionParsnip: how was the setup, I'm running arch on my laptop and Sabayon my desktop and I'm thinking of moving to Ubuntu Mini because of the Software Center, and debian packaging system
[01:22] <huttala> The laptop is dualGPU, I guess that's what messes things up.. :/
[01:22] <tarelerulz> Well, Yes is that normal ? Do you have round down ?  Like hard drive says 10 gb and you actually have 9gb
[01:22] <devnull_> KI4RO, well you will need to install windows inside of virtualbox ... wine isn't always the best solution ... im not sure if it can connect directly to USB or it still goes through the normal linux way
[01:23] <demonio> devnull_ thanks my problem is that i had install win7 and ubuntu but in the dual boot ubuntu is the first to start, so can i make in a way that is win7 to start first?
[01:23] <ActionParsnip> ElectricPrism: fine, ran the installer then ran:  sudo apt-get install fluxbox slim    and went for a shower
[01:23] <thoonai> average_drifter: hey
[01:23] <thoonai> :)
[01:23] <devnull_> demonio, yes you were already answered .. scroll up
[01:23] <HonestAbe> demonio, my current machine doesn't have a menu.lst, but go to /boot/grub/menu.lst and just move the win7 entry to the top of the list
[01:23] <ElectricPrism> cool
[01:23] <KI4RO> devnull_, Supposedly it can "see" the usb ports directly (virtualbox)
[01:24] <devnull_> KI4RO, yes virtual box can .. but i think that is because it has a kernel module ?   i think if linux doesn't see the usb device then wine won't
[01:24] <demonio> HonestAbe ok i'll try immediately
[01:24] <HonestAbe> wait!
[01:24] <devnull_> demonio, or set the default boot number to the windows number
[01:24] <HonestAbe> before you do, go read the documentation, i'd feel awful if you followed my paraphrased directions and your computer caught fire or melted or something awful
[01:25] <devnull_> lol
[01:25] <Riley88> im pretty sure u can do that in bios
[01:25] <KI4RO> devnull_, Linux can see it...rhythmbox, banshee and gtkpod all see it just fine
[01:25] <Riley88> set the boot order
[01:25] <demonio> HonestAbe i cant find menu.lst
[01:25] <devnull_> KI4RO, im not sure how that works ... they might be accessing it in a special way .. which wine can't ?
[01:26] <demonio> devnull_ where have i to go for make that?
[01:26] <KI4RO> devnull_, Nor am I
[01:26] <devnull_> demonio, where honestabe told you
[01:26] <ActionParsnip> demonio: its not used now, ubuntu uses grub2
[01:26] <devnull_> KI4RO, i wish i knew more about how that worked but im strapped for ideas ... lets see what google has to say
[01:27] <devnull_> KI4RO, seems like that is a popular topic ... itunes(wine) cant recognize ipod ... but it looks like people have fixed it
[01:28] <KI4RO> devnull_, Good luck...lots of answers but none seem to work so far...hence my reason for coming here...yep, very popular
[01:28] <devnull_> gotcha
[01:28] <aaas> getting intermittant reboots.  Not scheduled: see here: http://i.imgur.com/LzaAo.png   doesn't seem to be overheating or voltage, but had to enable those plots and will watch.  dmesg/syslog doens't reveal anything that would cause it so sounds more hardware related...any suggestions?
[01:28] <devnull_> silver rating on winehq
[01:28] <ActionParsnip> aaas: have you tested your RAM using memtest?
[01:29] <aaas> ActionParsnip no, but ill try that tonight
[01:30] <demonio> devnull_ HonstAbe I find it but i don't know what i have to change.. so can you help me?
[01:30] <devnull_> KI4RO, seems like a VM is the answer because it can directly access USB
[01:30] <demonio> my win7 is latest
[01:30] <KI4RO> devnull_, Yep, haven't had the nerve to try that yet LOL
[01:30] <devnull_> as long as you don't mind sitting through a windows install
[01:31] <devnull_> demonio, what version of ubuntu ?
[01:31] <KI4RO> devnull_, A windows install?
[01:31] <demonio> 12.10
[01:32] <devnull_> KI4RO, yes .. VM means virtual machine .. you will need to install windows inside of it ... it is not an emulator
[01:32] <ActionParsnip> KI4RO: if you go for virtualbox, you'll need the one from the virtualbox site (or PPA)
[01:32] <devnull_> you will literaly be booting windows inside of a virtual machine
[01:32] <ActionParsnip> KI4RO: the one in the ubuntu repos does not have raw usb access
[01:32] <devnull_> ActionParsnip, does that come with a kernel module ?
[01:32] <KI4RO> devnull_, Oh goodie!!  Don't have a Windows disk here
[01:32] <devnull_> lol   even better
[01:33] <ActionParsnip> devnull_: no idea, i'd imagine so but i only know the difference in that sense. easier to not buy apple rubbish :)
[01:33] <devnull_> ActionParsnip, yea im with ya on that .. i don't like proprietary things
[01:34] <ActionParsnip> devnull_: i don't mind proprietary, i just like things to work
[01:34] <devnull_> but then again i don't "sync" things either ... usb mass storage is my friend
[01:34] <KI4RO> devnull_, Wife bought it for me....I'm just trying to make it work
[01:34] <devnull_> KI4RO, no prob i understand ... ipods do their job well as a player ... your just screwed if you don't have itunes
[01:35] <devnull_> demonio, do a search on google ... you will find out how to do it
[01:35] <KI4RO> devnull_, Well I've been able to make it work with Rhythmbox, it plays and all, just trying to get this last feature to work
[01:35] <kaushal> Hi
=== gogogo__ is now known as gogogo_
[01:36] <devnull_> KI4RO, it would be cool to get that to work ... i would imagine someone is working on it
[01:36] <kaushal> Any recommended add-on plugins for dictionary in Firefox Browser?
[01:36] <KI4RO> devnull_, Hoping gtkpod folks are trying
[01:36] <kaushal> 17.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1
[01:36] <devnull_> KI4RO, for all i know they might have a development version with more features .. just becareful
[01:37] <devnull_> kaushal, what do you mean ... like for spellchecker ?
[01:37] <ania> hi i have tough question about hardware can any 1 help please//////??
[01:37] <KI4RO> devnull_, Hmmmm...interesting thought...where would I find it?
[01:37] <devnull_> ania, don't know until you ask your question
[01:37] <kaushal> devnull_: meaning of any word on the webpage
[01:37] <devnull_> kaushal, well if there was a plugin it is not ubuntu related ... check firefox extensions directory
[01:38] <kaushal> devnull_: any url?
[01:38] <devnull_> kaushal, GOOGLE IT
[01:38] <Slaptman> does anyone know how to restore ipod on ubuntu 12.04?
[01:38] <devnull_> the internet is your resource ... use it
[01:39] <ania> motherboard micro atx with intel atom......can it be powered by netbook psu? where to read about it .....please?
[01:39] <ElectricPrism> Q: anyone here running 13.04 daily? If I run it for say 6months will It automatically become 13.10 daily with updates?
[01:39] <ActionParsnip> kaushal: got a dictionary?
[01:39] <ActionParsnip> ElectricPrism: ask in #ubuntu+1 for pre-release
[01:39] <kaushal> ActionParsnip: ?
[01:39] <devnull_> ania ... not a ubuntu question
[01:39] <ElectricPrism> ActionParsnip: thx
[01:39] <ActionParsnip> ElectricPrism: Raring will upgrade to raring stable after release day, you will need to take extra steps to upgrade it to 13.10
[01:40] <Slaptman> gtkpod dont seem to work
[01:40] <ActionParsnip> kaushal: I thought you were having issues with words on a web page
[01:40] <devnull_> Slaptman, that is your best bet .. otherwise you will need to use  a VM with windows and itunes
[01:40] <kaushal> ActionParsnip: yes
[01:41] <kaushal> ActionParsnip: i saw a bunch of plugins but not sure which one to use
[01:41] <devnull_> ActionParsnip, kaushal wants to be able to somehow click on a word and have the dictionary definition i think
[01:41] <xenome> Hi, I have a preinstalled image that jumps to a login prompt while running the setup, does that mean something is failing?
[01:42] <xenome> i don't know what the logins are so I can't find a log to see what might have happened
[01:42] <devsfan1830> installing ubuntu server on a machine with an intel 6300 wifi module (wired connection not feasible at this time, this is just a test run for a minecraft server anyways). seems to want me to load firmwares labeled iwlwifi-6000-6.ucode and iwlwifi-6000-5.ucode. I cant seem to find any info on google and intels linux driver site is dead. any ideas?
[01:42] <dcplaya> My computer says 100% of disk space is full but i know its not. Doing "df -h" will show 100% used sometimes while other times its back to normal. Anyone know why?
[01:43] <ActionParsnip> kaushal: they have that as addons and extensions for web browsers
[01:43] <ActionParsnip> !find iwlwifi-6000-6.ucode
[01:43] <ubottu> Package/file iwlwifi-6000-6.ucode does not exist in quantal
[01:43] <devnull_> devsfan1830, lspci ... find your card in the list .. take that unique number and do a google search
[01:43] <devnull_> dcplaya, maybe temp files ?
[01:44] <ActionParsnip> devsfan1830: what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
[01:44] <dcplaya> devnull_: nope, I have searched my entire system for large files, they dont exist. I have rebooted multiple times as well
[01:44] <devnull_> xenome, preinstalled image ?
[01:44] <devsfan1830> im in the install GUI, not sure how to get what you ask for
[01:44] <devnull_> dcplaya, tell me you don't have 1 partition ?
[01:44] <norm_> join #Pipes
[01:45] <dcplaya> devnull_: yea (for ubuntu at least, I have other drives for other files)  Is that bad?
[01:45] <devnull_> devsfan1830 get to a terminal and type that command
[01:45] <ActionParsnip> devnull_: ctrl+alt+f3   run it there
[01:45] <devnull_> devsfan1830, ^^^^^^^^^^
[01:45] <ActionParsnip> !info firmware-iwlwifi
[01:45] <ubottu> Package firmware-iwlwifi does not exist in quantal
[01:46] <devnull_> dcplaya, i guess it is just preference ... but i don't like the single partition installs ... because things like this can happen ... you can to easily fill your partition up if something in var gets to big or what not
[01:46] <ActionParsnip> devsfan1830: are you installing debian?
[01:46] <devsfan1830> Ubuntu Server 12.10
[01:47] <dcplaya> devnull_:  the weird thing is that this happened about 2 months ago and then it just randomly "fixed" itself
[01:47] <devnull_> what version of ubuntu
[01:47] <dcplaya> devnull_:  and its a 1TB drive and I only am using 20% of that in reality
[01:47] <HonestAbe> i know this is ubuntu, but does anyone know the command to switch to a specific workspace in xfce? those channels are frightfully silent
[01:48] <thalib> hi evveryone i am having a problem
[01:48] <thalib> trying to install ubuntu
[01:48] <ActionParsnip> devsfan1830: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=689416
[01:48] <thalib> i installed it and at the end an error comes
[01:48] <ubottu> Debian bug 689416 in src:linux "Nonexistant files are asked for on Intel Centrino Ultimate-N 6300 (802.11 a/b/g/n 3X3) Half Mini Card" [Important,Fixed]
[01:48] <devnull_> HonestAbe, maybe alt+ctrl plus left or right to go back and forth .. or like alt+ctrl+1, 2, 3
[01:48] <thalib> after that when i try booting it it doesnt show up in the booting menue
[01:49] <dcplaya> devnull_: I am running 12.10
[01:49] <thalib> please help
[01:49] <devsfan1830> lsb_release -sc in terminal returns "not found"
[01:49] <HonestAbe> devnull_ well, here's the problem, i'm trying to bind the command to a keystroke, so i need the actual command, not the keystroke unfortunately.
[01:49] <devnull_> devsfan1830, are you still in the install ?
[01:49] <devnull_> HonestAbe, gotcha
[01:50] <devnull_> HonestAbe, xfce doesn't let you bind shortcuts for desktop switching ?
[01:50] <devsfan1830> im in the terminal, i can reboot to go back
[01:50] <ActionParsnip> thalib: what is the error?
[01:51] <devsfan1830> i tried going on despite the missing files, it couldnt resolve with the DHCP
[01:51] <devnull_> devsfan1830, can you not finish the install ?
[01:51] <ActionParsnip> thalib: simply saying 'an error' means nothing and doesn't tell us anyting to help you
[01:51] <devnull_> devsfan1830, tell it not to get updates while installing
[01:51] <thalib> the installer was not working or something but when i checked it had installed
[01:51] <ActionParsnip> devnull_: try:  cat /etc/issue
[01:51] <thalib> will check again
[01:51] <ActionParsnip> devsfan1830: ^
[01:51] <thalib> sorry
[01:53] <devnull_> devsfan1830, did you not have the lspci command in terminal ?
[01:53] <HonestAbe> devnull_ it does, I was looking in the wrong place. I needed to be in the window manager settings. I was looking at the keyboard shortcuts. Who'd have thought?
[01:53] <devnull_> hehe
[01:53] <devnull_> i hear ya
[01:53] <devsfan1830> i ran lspci, it just reported the name and model of the wifi card and its REV, id go directly to intel but the site they link to is down
[01:54] <devnull_> gotcha ... one more time .. what is the card .. ill check
[01:54] <devsfan1830> hang on
[01:54] <thalib> the error is c:\users\owner\appdata\local\temp\wubi-12.10-rev273.log
[01:55] <devnull_> oh wubi
[01:55] <ActionParsnip> thalib: so you are using wubi?
[01:55] <ActionParsnip> thalib: why did you not say you were using wubi?
[01:55] <thalib> thats what ubuntu gave to install through the usb stick
[01:56] <devsfan1830> Intel Corporation Centrino Ultimate-N 6300  (rev 35)
[01:56] <thalib> i thought everyone used that
[01:56] <ActionParsnip> thalib: yes, if you open the USB stick in windows it will offer you wubi
[01:56] <devnull_> i would say ... only use wubi if you have to ... not sure if you have to or not
[01:56] <thalib> i dont know anything about linux
[01:56] <devnull_> devsfan1830, thanks
[01:56] <ActionParsnip> thalib: oh hell no, wubi is nasty
[01:56] <thalib> how else can i install it
[01:56] <ActionParsnip> thalib: I recommend you run a chkdsk on your NTFS partition to ensure it is healthy
[01:57] <ActionParsnip> thalib: boot to the USB stick and you can install Ubuntu to its own partition
[01:57] <ActionParsnip> thalib: I recommend you use add/remove programs to pull wubi off
[01:57] <devnull_> yea ... linux in windows is a ungodly idea
[01:57] <ActionParsnip> thalib: You can single boot Ubuntu on its own, as the sole OS. There would be no Windows OS to run the installer from, would there?
[01:57] <TomyLobo> what do kde and gnome generally do when they run programs without a console?
[01:58] <TomyLobo> just nohup or something else?
[01:58] <thalib> ok will try that now but how am i to unistall the things which have installed now
[01:58] <ActionParsnip> thalib: add/remove programs...like any other windows application
[01:59] <HonestAbe> oh man, I remember my first linux install, it was a migrated wubi install on a netbook, what a nightmare.
[01:59] <devnull_> devsfan1830,  iwwlagn
[01:59] <TomyLobo> why would you do that?
[01:59] <ActionParsnip> TomyLobo: massochistim?
[01:59] <HonestAbe> no cd drive and I didn't know any better
[01:59] <TomyLobo> linux reinstalls are so painless
[01:59] <TomyLobo> ah
[01:59] <xenome> devnull: yes, the preinstalled-desktop image, more specifically the omap4 image
[01:59] <HonestAbe> later, i learned about the wonders of netbooting
[01:59] <devnull_> install linux from floppies then we will talk :)
[02:00] <thalib> how do i do a chkdsk
[02:00] <ItsTheSource> ntfs? boot into safe mode...
[02:00] <devnull_> but then again back then kernels fit on a diskette
[02:01] <devnull_> how i do not miss slackware
=== MartinS is now known as Guest34831
[02:01] <thalib> yup running chekdsk now
[02:02] <devnull_> devsfan1830, thats the driver you need ... it might require some extra parameters though
[02:03] <thalib> hello actionparsnip
[02:03] <devsfan1830> ok cool, but now how do i get it if intellinuxwirele­ss.­org is dead
[02:03] <devnull_> devsfan1830, you don't ... you don't get anything from them
[02:03] <thalib> what do i do now how do i put ubuntu into the usb and boot it from there
[02:04] <devnull_> as far as i can tell it should be available to you
[02:05] <grats> Hey I am having a problem with ubuntu that only the desktop/mouse shows? I have tried some of the guides online no luck. Anyone know a fix?
[02:05] <ItsTheSource> ok i'm confused. volume slider has no effect on the volume for my headphones even though in alsamixer its changing the master volume. weird...
[02:05] <devnull_> ItsTheSource, how about the headphone volume slider ?
[02:05] <ActionParsnip> thalib: you know, check your drive is healthy.... its a standard windows thing
[02:05] <thalib> yeah
[02:05] <ActionParsnip> thalib: right click C drive -> properties -> tools......
[02:05] <thalib> its healthy no bad sectors or anything
[02:06] <ActionParsnip> thalib: when did you last test it?
[02:06] <ItsTheSource> yea adjusting headphone volume in alsamixer works fine. Any way to lock master and headphone volumes?
[02:06] <thalib> dont know
[02:06] <ActionParsnip> thalib: then you have no way at all of substantiating your 'no bad sectors' claim at all if you have never tested the drive
[02:07] <dcplaya> ha! I found the stupid file using all my space!  a log file for VNC
[02:07] <thalib> i just did on command prompt
[02:07] <julio> hello
[02:07] <julio> alguien habla español
[02:07] <ActionParsnip> thalib: it won't work without rebooting
[02:07] <julio> ??
[02:07] <DaemonicApathy> !es|julio
[02:07] <ubottu> julio: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[02:07] <ActionParsnip> !es | julio
[02:07] <thalib> ok
[02:07] <devnull_> dcplaya, there you go .... it is usually a log file .... vino-server ?
[02:07] <ActionParsnip> thalib: so you didn't do it
[02:07] <julio> sorry :/
[02:08] <thalib> ok
[02:08] <DaemonicApathy> Todo es bien, julio. Buena suerta con sus problemas.
[02:08] <devnull_> ItsTheSource, why do you want to lock them ?
[02:08] <DaemonicApathy> *suerte? I forget.
[02:08] <thalib> i dont understand u asked me to do a chkdsk
[02:08] <thalib> i did
[02:08] <thalib> it said no bad sectors
[02:08] <thalib> now what do i have to do
[02:08] <ActionParsnip> thalib: use the GUI and select to fix sectors and such, you will be asked to reboot
[02:09] <ActionParsnip> thalib: did you uninstall wubi?
[02:09] <thalib> yes
[02:09] <ActionParsnip> thalib: ok, boot to the usb stick you made, resize your NTFS and install to the freed space
[02:09] <ItsTheSource> ...that way the volume slider actually works for my headphone jack. If I can tie them together so they raise and lower together problem solved...
[02:09] <thalib> how do i do that
[02:10] <devnull_> ItsTheSource, you don't really want that i don't think
[02:10] <thalib> how do i for starters boot to the usb stick
[02:10] <thalib> and also i just want to tell the ubuntu that was downloaded has wubi on the usb stick
[02:10] <thalib> should i delete that
[02:10] <thalib> too
[02:10] <devnull_> thalib, yea they all do
[02:11] <ItsTheSource> Can you propose an alternate solution? I can launch alsamixer and modify the level for the headphones but that's a pain...
[02:11] <HonestAbe> devnull_ funny enough, he may not actually want it, but I sure as hell do
[02:11] <ActionParsnip> thalib: have the USB you made with the ISO in the port, select it as the boot device and you will get a live USB OS
[02:11] <HonestAbe> my headphone jack is closer to my speakers than my speaker jack
[02:11] <devnull_> let me think about it
[02:11] <HonestAbe> and i have been just manually adjusting it with the dial, but now that it's been brought up....
[02:12] <devnull_> so you want the master to go up when the headphone slider goes up ?
[02:12] <HonestAbe> other way around
[02:12] <ItsTheSource> actually the other way around. The volume slider affects the master.
[02:13] <devnull_> how about you just keep headphones at MAX level and then you can just adjust the master through gnome or your software ?
[02:13] <thalib> thats the problem i dont know how to do it
[02:13] <ItsTheSource> master has no effect on headphone volume
[02:13] <mad-lulz-yo> devnull_, no one who has any decent pair of cans would do that
[02:13] <thalib> how do i select it to become the boot device
[02:13] <ItsTheSource> there's mut or max
[02:13] <ItsTheSource> *mute
[02:14] <dfcnvt> I just plugged in my speaker to my computer... it doesn't make a sound. How do I restart my audio interface?
[02:14] <devnull_> ug
[02:14] <HonestAbe> uh oh, now the demon of audio problems has reared its hideous head
[02:15] <devnull_> its coming in waves today .... multiple ipod questions now multiple sound questions .. :)
[02:15] <ItsTheSource> lol
[02:15] <devnull_> lol
[02:15] <devnull_> and i just spent 2 days messing with alsa,pulse and hda-analyzer
[02:15] <alephant> Hi all
[02:15] <alephant> How do I tell whether package foo has been compiled with support for bar?
[02:15] <alephant> (e.g. whether "pppd" has PAM support)
[02:16] <ItsTheSource> If you compiled it there might be a configure.log
[02:16] <thalib> hello
[02:16] <devnull_> does debs contain that meta information?
[02:17] <devnull_> do
[02:17] <devnull_> ItsTheSource, so you are saying you would like ... when headphones are plugged in the volume control adjusted the headphones not the master ?
[02:18] <devnull_> instead of adjusting pcm or master ... you want the headphone level adjusted
[02:18] <ItsTheSource> Since master doesn't affect my headphone volume then that would work.
[02:18] <ItsTheSource> Yes.
[02:19] <thalib> how do i make my usb stick the booting device
[02:19] <devnull_> thalib, idk .. go into your bios and find how to change the boot order .. or press F9 or F10 for a boot menu
[02:19] <DaemonicApathy> Either adjust the primary boot device in your BIOS, or select it manually when turning on the computer.
[02:20] <devnull_> we don't know what bios you have
[02:20] <thalib> how do i go into the bios
[02:20] <ItsTheSource> F2, F12, DEL...press all of them at once
[02:21] <devnull_> escape even
[02:21] <Zarcowi> lol
[02:21] <thalib> thats when the computer starts right
[02:22] <devnull_> ItsTheSource, i wonder if there is a pulse config for it ... because that is detectable i believe wether headphones are plugged in
[02:22] <ItsTheSource> Well I have Headphones in my audio output devices. If I select it and adjust the volume...nada...
[02:23] <devnull_> dfcnvt, pulseaudio -k
[02:23] <devnull_> you can try pulseaudio volume control
[02:24] <devnull_> pavucontrol
[02:24] <dfcnvt> nothing worked
[02:24] <dfcnvt> Let me do the power cycle on my computer.
[02:24] <devnull_> dfcnvt, i wouldn't
[02:24] <dfcnvt> ..
[02:24] <devnull_> there are numerous reasons for audio not working
[02:25] <machicola> what are some tasks people do with startup scripts? or shell scripts
[02:25] <kaushal> Hi
[02:25] <devnull_> drivers ... mixer levels ... etc
[02:25] <ItsTheSource> ...incorrect device selected...
[02:25] <dfcnvt> I've used up on smplayer often but I don't remember messing around with speaker's interface.
[02:25] <manju> man
[02:25] <devnull_> is it a desktop ?
[02:25] <dfcnvt> let me double check to see if it's selected a correct device
[02:25] <dfcnvt> yes
[02:25] <mad-lulz-yo> machicola, things youd like to setup and run...
[02:26] <dcplaya> Can someone recommend a good VNC server for 12.10 that will start on boot?
[02:26] <devnull_> dcplaya, vino-server comes with unity i believe
[02:26] <mad-lulz-yo> machicola, servers, make wifi connections
[02:26] <devnull_> but i don't think it starts till you have logged in ?
[02:26] <HonestAbe> whew, solved my audio prob, it was xfce related (of course). It was using hdmi as my default audio
[02:27] <devnull_> that will happen
[02:27] <dcplaya> Im running a headless. I usually login via SSH but sometimes I need a GUI
[02:27] <ItsTheSource> no you don't :D
[02:27] <HonestAbe> ^
[02:27] <devnull_> im not sure but vino-server may be user specific ?
[02:27] <dr_willis> dcplaya:  you can just ssh in and start vncserver by hand. works well for me
[02:27] <ztgu> Hi, I am having problems with ctrl + alt + f7 from console mode. I get a black screen and can't do anything
[02:27] <ztgu> Can anyone help?
[02:27] <dr_willis> you dont want to use vino on a headless server
[02:27] <devnull_> ztgu  fresh install ?
[02:28] <ztgu> What is happening in this process?
[02:28] <devnull_> dr_willis, good point
[02:28] <dfcnvt> ztgu: /etc/init.d/gdm restart
[02:28] <dfcnvt> but unsure if there is gdm in it
[02:28] <machicola> ahh, wifi, definitely... thanks mad-lulz-yo
[02:28] <dcplaya> dr_willis: I used to do that but I just found a 700GB VNCserver log file so I am apprently doing it incorrectly
[02:28] <devnull_> 12.10 would be lightdm
[02:28] <mad-lulz-yo> stgu, #killall Xorg
[02:28] <mad-lulz-yo> stgu, #startx
[02:28] <jschall> why do the nvidia drivers make the splash screen go completely fugly?
[02:28] <ztgu> devnull_: fresh install won't work
[02:28] <devnull_> dcplaya, can you kill logging ?
[02:28] <ActionParsnip> ztgu: killall -u $USER     will do it
[02:28] <devnull_> ztgu .... what did it just stop working .. did you just install ??
[02:29] <dr_willis> dcplaya:  edit the vncserver script to remove logs. or set a no logging option perhaps
[02:29] <devnull_> jschall, what splash screen ?
[02:29] <HonestAbe> dcplaya sorry to be an idiot, but have you tried trimming down logs?
[02:29] <ActionParsnip> ztgu: what video chip do you use?
[02:29] <jschall> devnull_: the ubuntu splash screen
[02:29] <HonestAbe> erp, dr_willis is vastly quicker
[02:29] <devnull_> jschall, you talking about the screen while it is booting ?
[02:29] <jschall> devnull_: yes
[02:30] <devnull_> jschall, probably a framebuffer problem ... might need to add an option to your kernel boot .. might not be finding the video mode correctly
[02:30] <devnull_> my guess
[02:30] <jschall> devnull_: it switched to a text-based splash and a bunch of crap gets printed over the top of it in a very broken manner
[02:30] <ztgu> dfcnvt:  etc/init.d/gdm restart, what does it do?
[02:30] <dr_willis> nvidia and flgrx drivers have issues with plymouth ;)
=== vnbang_ is now known as vnbang2003
[02:30] <ztgu> ActionParsnip: I have amd, what does killall -u $USER do?
[02:30] <haylo> is some version of live build being maintained for ubuntu ?
[02:30] <dr_willis> i tend to just disable plymouth
[02:30] <devnull_> yea i used to have similar issue with fglrx drivers ... but seems to be fixed these days for me
[02:31] <dfcnvt> ztgu: It will restart the x server. (Where you tried to get in CTRL+F7)
[02:31] <ActionParsnip> ztgu: kills all the processes belonging to your user
[02:32] <aartist> Hi, What is the one thing, that I can do, if my mouse is stuck?
[02:32] <devnull_> jschall, luckily you don't really have to worry about it .. it just wont look pretty
[02:32] <ztgu> ActionParsnip: yeah, I know, but why?
[02:32] <jschall> why can't ubuntu get a damn splash screen right after 10 years?
[02:32] <devnull_> jschall, they do have it right
[02:32] <ActionParsnip> ztgu: then why ask what it does, when you know?
[02:32] <devnull_> does the LiveCD / USB boot correctly with the splash ?
[02:32] <ItsTheSource> OH what a tease...http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=900305
[02:32] <jschall> clearly not.
[02:32] <ActionParsnip> ztgu: it will allow you to log in and hopefully give a GUI.
[02:33] <devnull_> jschall, are you new to this ?
[02:33] <dr_willis> i belive the nvidia/fglr x stuff with plymouth has  laege  threads on the forums
[02:33] <jschall> not remotely
[02:33] <Preflex> Hi, I'm trying to convert a series of .png files to video.   Any suggestions on a good way to do this?
[02:33] <devnull_> then you should know better
[02:33] <dr_willis> Preflex:  ffmpeg/mencoder
[02:33] <jschall> anyway, yes, nvidia's problem, but yes, ubuntu's problem too.
=== vnbang2003 is now known as vnbang
[02:33] <devnull_> jschall, does the install boot correctly with the splash ??
[02:34] <jschall> you mean the livecd?
[02:34] <devnull_> i guess if you have an older version of ubuntu
[02:34]  * dr_willis dosent worry about a 10 sec boot animation when he had 10+days of uptime
[02:34] <devnull_> but yes
[02:34] <jschall> yes, it works with nouveau or nv or whatever
[02:34] <ztgu> ActionParsnip:  The thing is that I can get a GUI working with startx, ( i am using KDE) But the ctrl + alt + del process freezes my system.
[02:34] <devnull_> jschall, then it is your problem not ubuntus problem
[02:34] <devnull_> ztgu, don't do that
[02:35] <devnull_> jschall, but to fix it .. lets move forward
[02:35] <ztgu> devnull_: do what? startx or ctrl - alt + f7 ??
[02:35] <devnull_> find out what drivers and settings the LiveCD is using for video and try to mimick that setup
[02:35] <devnull_> ztgu ... do not ctrl+alt+delete
[02:36] <Preflex> I've tried mencoder, but it doesn't seem to be working right.  I only get two or three frames and then it goes nuts.   http://pastebin.com/aW715Yjh
[02:36] <jschall> anyway, i'd like it fixed for everyone. i'd like to understand how to work around nvidia's crap and implement it.
[02:36] <devnull_> jschall, i have had issues in the past where the video is flawless from the livecd but after install i had to fix it
[02:36] <devnull_> jschall, nvidia's crap is better than ATI's crap
[02:36] <devnull_> it is probably a setting of yours
[02:36] <Preflex> #ffmpeg wouldn't help me, because ubuntu's version of ffmpeg is a "fake fork"
[02:36] <dr_willis> its not going to be a trivial fix with nvidia/plymouth.
[02:36] <devnull_> check to see what mode is set in the kernel boot
[02:36] <WXZ> xrandr prints out a list of your root windows, right?
[02:37] <ztgu> devnull_: why?
[02:37] <dr_willis> fake fork = spork
[02:38] <ztgu> ActionParsnip: Do you know of an alternative to suspend or if I can make my suspend resume with startx command instead ?
[02:38] <dr_willis> ffmpeg in ubuntu is the ffmpeg fork known as avconv i think. check ffmpeg --help
[02:38] <smog> fork shaped like a spoon, with the teeth closer together = spork
[02:39] <aartist> Hi, I need urgent help. On ubuntu my cursor doesn't move.  Does your cursor moves?
[02:39] <jschall> devnull_: a setting of "mine" implies i changed a setting. it may indeed be a setting on my computer.  i have googled about it, it says to run hwinfo --framebuffer and pick a resolution, but none of the resolutions are the native resolution of my (system76) laptop, which seems pretty dumb.
[02:39] <dr_willis> aartist:  yes. moves fine here
[02:39] <bsmith093> you know how some really advanced bulk renamers can add the parent folder(s) to the name of a file? well i need to remove that part organized like this stuff/blah/status/blah - authorname - filename.txt the only matching parts will be the "blah", and it is garanteed to be a part of the filename
[02:39] <devnull_> jschall, it might be a different setting
[02:40] <jschall> devnull_: and the nouveau drivers clearly display the splash at native resolution
[02:40] <devnull_> gotcha
[02:40] <devnull_> and your using nouveau drivers ?
[02:40] <jschall> devnull_: no, i'm using the native drivers
[02:40] <aartist> dr_willis: ok.. so it's not internet problem. what I can do to solve it?
[02:40] <devnull_> oh
[02:41] <jschall> devnull_: nouveau is what's used on the livecd, right?
[02:41] <dr_willis> aartist:  no idea. you havent given us any details. unplug/replug the mouse and se if it works
[02:41] <devnull_> not sure ... that is the open source drivers ... so i don't know what you mean by native
[02:41] <jschall> devnull_: oh, i don't mean native, i mean proprietary
[02:41] <devnull_> gotcha
[02:42] <devnull_> not sure about the nvidia drivers ... do you feel like you have to have the proprietary drivers ?
[02:42] <ItsTheSource> bsmith093, you could probably use rename and pwd to rename your files
[02:42] <aartist> dr_willis: I am on laptop... with intel machine and installed ubuntu via wubi. and works good everyday. I can reboot and it may work fine.. but I like to make it working without rebooting.
[02:42] <devnull_> ItsTheSource, my search is running a little dry for your headphone issue .. maybe jack is needed
[02:42] <bsmith093> ItsTheSource: its not the pwd but 2 levels up from there
[02:42] <jschall> devnull_: yes, i do things that require the proprietary drivers.
[02:42] <HonestAbe> aartist: from personal experience, can i reccomend that you reinstall?
[02:42] <devnull_> jschall, 12.10 right ?
[02:43] <aartist> dr_willis: I can click the way it is.  But  the cursor doesn't move with mousepad.
[02:43] <xenome> is there an easy one liner to completely remove ubuntu-desktop?
[02:43] <HonestAbe> not necessarily to fix whatever problem, but wubi installs are problematic to say the least
[02:43] <devnull_> jschall, btw does the splash screen load up correctly at all .. even for a second ?
[02:43] <jschall> no
[02:43] <devnull_> xenome yes
[02:43] <dr_willis> aartist:   see if it works ffom s live cd as a test
[02:43] <jschall> devnull_: it does not
[02:43] <devnull_> okay
[02:43] <xenome> devnull: how would you do it?
[02:43] <aartist> dr_willis: thanks.., I don't have LiveCD.
[02:44] <devnull_> xenome did you do a google search yet ?
[02:44] <dr_willis> aartist:  time to get one. they are handy.
[02:44] <devnull_> jschall, let me check on that
[02:44] <HonestAbe> aartist, have you got a thumb drive?
[02:44] <dr_willis> aartist:  or make a live usb
[02:44] <xenome> yes, but it seems like an apt-get remove ubuntu-desktop just removes the meta package, not really any other packages
[02:44] <xenome> i could remove gnome-*
[02:44] <ItsTheSource> I think bash will allow you to match the longest string from the beginning to the last match of a character. I'm trying to remember the syntax...maybe PWD=$(pwd) ${PWD##/}...bah i know that's wrong..
[02:44] <xenome> but it seems like there is a cleaner method
[02:44] <dr_willis> xenome:  thats how meta packages work. yes
[02:44] <aartist> dr_willis: no.
[02:44] <devnull_> xenome why are you doing this in the first place ???
[02:45] <aartist> dr_willis: I was looking for some keyboard command tweaks.. that will get this going.
[02:45] <xenome> can I not just look at what the metapacke installs, and reverse that?
[02:45] <ItsTheSource> devnull_, thanks for looking. I'm not coming up with much either...
[02:45] <devnull_> jschall, they just made some adjustments to the nvidia-graphics-drivers package that might be a known issue
[02:45] <xenome> devnull, because I want to get to a stripped down X running only openbox from init script
[02:45] <xenome> trying to do it as clean as possible
[02:45] <devnull_> xenome ... so install openbox
[02:45] <dr_willis> xenome:  not really its a failing of how metapackages work. they just dpend on other things
[02:46] <jschall> devnull_: nvidia did or canonical did or what?
[02:46] <dr_willis> makes  ti easy to install stuff.. but not easier to remove
[02:46] <devnull_> jschall, checking ... it is because it thinks there is no framebuffer to use
[02:46] <devnull_> jschall, ill see if i can find an update or fix
[02:46] <ItsTheSource> bsmith093, ${string%substring}: deletes shortest match of substring from back of string...
[02:46] <devnull_> xenome you can have multiple window managers ... you can pick what you want to get into on login
[02:47] <somsip> xenome: I tried that once. I ended up reinstalling from the minimal image to get a clean setup
[02:47] <devnull_> jschall, on shutdown do you see the splashscreen ?
[02:48] <jschall> devnull_: not sure yet. i doubt it. i can find out now?
[02:48] <jschall> devnull_: i'll just do that.
[02:48] <devnull_> i dont want to make you reboot
[02:48] <Solace_> could anyone tell me why I can't execute eclipse?:( private message for details
[02:48] <xenome> somsip: that's probably a good idea
[02:49] <devnull_> Solace_, just ask your question in here with some a lil detail
[02:49] <somsip> xenome: I found I couldn't get things as clean as I wanted without trawling for dead config files. Easier to min install and 'apt-get install {WM of choice}'
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[02:49] <devnull_> xenome don't remove any other packages .. just install openbox ... logout .. you should be able to pick your session at the login screen
[02:50] <devnull_> jschall, that was dang fast
[02:50] <tocohead> question, want to install ubuntu 12.04 and have a 64 bit but it recomends 32bit, why and which is best?
[02:50] <xenome> devnull: I'm looking for no window manager, I don't want a prompt, I'm setting up a pretty simple device
[02:50] <Solace_> downloaded eclipse Juno with wget http://www.ocdsoft.com/files/debian/eclipse-cpp.tar.gz && tar -xvf eclipse-cpp.tar.gz && mv eclipse-cpp /usr/local/eclipse-cpp && ln -s /usr/local/eclipse-cpp/eclipse eclipse && rm eclipse-cpp.tar.gz
[02:50] <somsip> tocohead: almost certainly 64 bit
[02:50] <jschall> devnull_: it does not work on shutdown
[02:50] <devnull_> xenome, openbox is a window manager
[02:50] <ActionParsnip> tocohead: depends on the cpu you are installing on, how much ram you have and the use of the OS
[02:50] <xenome> i'm sure, gdm
[02:50] <Solace_> but when I use the command eclipse or cd the directory and ./eclipse, cannot execute binary
[02:50] <devnull_> jschall, thank you for the information ... fast reboot btw
[02:50] <xenome> err i'm sorry, gdm
[02:50] <xenome> display manger
[02:51] <HonestAbe> ActionParsnip, I love your name
[02:51] <dr_willis> gdm can autologin
[02:51] <ActionParsnip> HonestAbe: its an old harry hill joke
[02:51] <ItsTheSource> Solace_, you may need to run that with xvpf for your tar arguments
[02:51] <jschall> devnull_: yep, it's a fresh install on a system76 gazelle professional - no ssd though, could be faster :)
[02:51] <xenome> yeah but I don't need all that stuff running, I've got a limited embedded device
[02:51] <devnull_> gazelle ... nice
[02:51] <somsip> xenome: you want simple - slim may be worth considering as login manager
[02:51] <dr_willis> start x from rc.local then
[02:51] <devnull_> xenome ... what stuff ??????
[02:52] <ActionParsnip> tocohead: there is no single best, if there was then they would kick out only one ISO...wouldn't they
[02:52] <Solace_> @ItsTheSource ./eclipse -xvf?
[02:53] <devnull_> jschall, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/1063969            looks promising
[02:53] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1063969 in nvidia-graphics-drivers (Ubuntu) "NVIDIA does not work with framebuffer drivers" [Wishlist,Triaged]
[02:54] <devnull_> but you can enable it in a config file and 2 commands ... but your kernel will throw warnings at you
[02:54] <jschall> devnull_: right, so it is entirely nvidia's fault
[02:55] <devnull_> jschall, looks that way ... but if you want the framebuffer support you can have it ... but it will throw a warning in the log
[02:55] <ItsTheSource> ah...no, wget http://www.ocdsoft.com/files/debian/eclipse-cpp.tar.gz && tar -xvpf eclipse-cpp.tar.gz && mv eclipse-cpp /usr/local/eclipse-cpp && ln -s /usr/local/eclipse-cpp/eclipse eclipse && rm eclipse-cpp.tar.gz
[02:55] <jschall> devnull_: i wonder why.
[02:56] <devnull_> something like the nvidia drivers dont support framebuffer so if you enable it is a unsupported feature ?
[02:56] <jschall> devnull_: also, for some reason hwinfo --framebuffer reports that i don't have any framebuffers at my native resolution
[02:56] <devnull_> correct
[02:56] <devnull_> you have none at the moment because they are disabled
[02:56] <tocohead> 4xAND 9650, memory 7913 MB, ATI Radeon HD 3200. general use
[02:56] <jschall> devnull_: god i hate nvidia so much.
[02:57] <devnull_> still better than ATI ... a boot screen is a minor issue ... Nvidia just increased their graphics peformance on linux by 40% i wouldn't complain to to much :)
[02:57] <jschall> devnull_: how much worse is ATI?
[02:57] <spyzer> hey everyone, does the open source radeon driver supports open gl ES acceleration?
[02:57] <tocohead> was confused as they have 32bit (recomended) next to the download
[02:57] <devnull_> getting better ... but bad driver support
[02:58] <jschall> devnull_: i guess with valve pressuring them they might work a bit harder on the linux drivers.
[02:58] <devnull_> tocohead, because 32 bit will run on all 32b and 64b processors ... but 64bit will only work on ... 64bit
[02:58] <Solace_> ahhh, so just change -xvf to -xpvf :) thank you very much
[02:58] <devnull_> jschall, they did .. they just increased performance .. like just recently ..i thin it is on valve for linux's site
[02:58] <tocohead> ok thank 64bit it will be
[02:59] <devnull_> framebuffer is a minor issue compared to 3d rendering
[02:59] <dr_willis> tocohead:  idiot proofing for people that have no clue what 32/64bit mean
[02:59] <ItsTheSource> ...maintains permissions. If that doesn't work then just run # chmod +x /usr/local/eclipse-cpp/eclipse
[02:59] <devnull_> dr_willis, i was going to say the same thing ... in a slightly different way ;)
[03:00] <ItsTheSource> idiot proofing?!? impossible!
[03:00] <devnull_> jschall, but you can enable it if you want ... people are saying they aren't running into stability issues by having it enabled
[03:00] <tocohead> thanks for all your help, using Linix Mint and thinking Ubuntu will be better
[03:00] <dr_willis> devnull_:  im sick of  bending over backwards to idipt proof stuff. then getting  asked to do backflips also.  ;)
[03:00] <jschall> devnull_: anyway, it just bugs me because its embarrassing for ubuntu, embarrassing for nvidia (but less so), and embarrassing for me when my $1400 computer looks "broken" with the OS it was purportedly designed for.
[03:00] <devnull_> haha
[03:00] <spyzer> anybody please
[03:01] <devnull_> i hear ya ... i am a programmer and web developer ... goes with the job
[03:01] <dr_willis> tocohead:  i dont see much point in using mint really.
[03:01] <HonestAbe> jschall what kind of computer?
[03:01] <jschall> devnull_: anyway, i'm trying ubuntu again after switching to kde for a very long time. my next issue is why can't i drag windows smoothly?
[03:01] <jschall> HonestAbe: system76
[03:01] <devnull_> jschall, comment #7 in the link will fix it .... you should be fine ... nvidia probably changed something in how their software works and they probably don't need it for other os drivers
[03:01] <ActionParsnip> tocohead: 64bit is my recommendation
[03:02] <HonestAbe> jschall nifty!
[03:02] <dr_willis> spyzer:  state the issue to che chennel
[03:02] <ActionParsnip> tocohead: remember the target audience of ubuntu. If you have a 64bit OS you can run both 32bit and 32bit
[03:02] <tocohead> I liked the look and windows design. but having problems with it
[03:02] <ActionParsnip> tocohead: so it covers the users who are unsure of their CPU, or computers in general
[03:02] <devnull_> jschall,   that is another issue
[03:03] <jschall> devnull_: known?
[03:03] <devnull_> jschall, and btw .. if i didn't have to i wouldn't buy an ATI card .. but my laptop is an APU
[03:03] <tocohead> makes since ActionParsnip
[03:03] <devnull_> jschall, like ... a setting somewhere ... might be a composite issue
[03:03] <devnull_> kde on 12.10 ?
[03:03] <jschall> devnull_: kde on 12.04. i just got around to grabbing 12.10
[03:03] <devnull_> maybe you need sync to vblank on
[03:04] <spyzer> dr_willis: i am trying to look for tizen sdk development. The emulator needs open gl ES accelration. My laptop has ati radeon hd 4500 . So I wished to know whether the radeon driver supports that?
[03:04] <devnull_> not sure .... i haven't had that issue in like 2-3 years since the drivers got better for ATI
[03:04] <jschall> devnull_: they aren't tearing, they're just jerky
[03:04] <devnull_> okay
[03:04] <dr_willis> spyzer:   no idea.. thats why i said ask the channel. not me. ;)
[03:04] <devnull_> do you have a CPU monitor ?
[03:04] <spyzer> anybody :)
[03:05] <Muphrid> hai
[03:05] <devnull_> spyzer, something that opengl3 offers ?
[03:05] <devnull_> jschall, i was going to say drag a window around and see how high your cpu spikes
[03:05] <jschall> devnull_: no spikes.
[03:05] <devnull_> okay
[03:06] <jschall> devnull_: all 8 lines stay below 50% :)
[03:06] <devnull_> hehe ... dang you
[03:06] <jschall> devnull_: just grabbed compizconfig
[03:06] <devnull_> yea .. check in the compiz settings manager
[03:07] <jschall> devnull_: i really wish ubuntu had built on/polished kde instead of gnome
[03:07] <devnull_> i guess you could grab kubuntu ?
[03:07] <jschall> devnull_: because this is a serious pain compared to how well kde works, but kde also has rough edges (search, for example)
[03:07] <rushboy> hello can anyone please tell me where can i see the git folder ?
[03:08] <rushboy> ubuntu 11.10
[03:08] <devnull_> maybe kde has its own composite engine ?
[03:08] <devnull_> i really haven't touched KDE in like 10 years
[03:08] <ultraparadigm> !Help!  ?Where did my Desktop Cube go?
[03:08] <ubottu> ultraparadigm: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[03:08] <jschall> devnull_: it does, kwin has its own compositing
[03:08] <devnull_> jschall, so maybe it is a compiz issue then
[03:09] <ultraparadigm> Did the version of Compiz in 12.10 get rid of the desktop cube?
[03:09] <devnull_> ultraparadigm, compiz plugins
[03:09] <mogaj> How do i get Twitter web app in ubuntu 12.10
[03:09] <devnull_> compiz-plugins-extra
[03:10] <spyzer> sometimes i keep on getting system problem detected with evolution-calender-factory, is that a known bug?
[03:10] <devnull_> how do you get the bot to describe a package?
[03:10] <spyzer> If yes, is there some short fix for that
[03:10] <ultraparadigm> Thanks!
[03:10] <devnull_> hmm ... let me check that package .. might not be the correct one
[03:10] <ultraparadigm> Devnull, that the second important thing I found missing in 12.10 that was in 12.04
[03:11] <spyzer> also when I try to generate the error report , in the apport-gtk it just shows me a loading icon when I click on details
[03:11] <somsip> devnull_: use !info {packagename}
[03:11] <spyzer> is there any way for me to get the details
[03:11] <devnull_> thanks
[03:11] <spyzer> so i can atleast do some hotfix if possible
[03:11] <ultraparadigm> The first most important thing was the linux-headers.  My video drivers FUBARed my PC upon compile untill i figured that out.
[03:11] <devnull_> !info compiz-plugins-extra
[03:11] <ubottu> compiz-plugins-extra (source: compiz): transitional dummy package.. In component universe, is extra. Version 1:0.9.8.6-0ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 3 kB, installed size 73 kB
[03:11] <spyzer> anyone please
[03:12] <spyzer> Even my crash reporter dies
[03:12] <devnull_> ultraparadigm, yea i thought i was given a disabled compiz manager .. but you just need to install the extra plugins and it will be just like before
[03:13] <devnull_> ultraparadigm, yea .... just grab the headers always .. its always a safe bet
[03:13] <datruth> I'm using djbdns/tinydns and i'm having a hard time understanding how I am to do reverse dns for my /29 subnet could some help?
[03:13] <ultraparadigm> Thanks so much!
[03:13] <DaemonicApathy> Does anyone have a copy of the original 12.04 ISO that they would be willing to send me?
[03:14] <devnull_> you can download it
[03:14] <DaemonicApathy> I can download 12.04.1
[03:15] <bazhang> datruth, thats not an ubuntu issue; try ##networking or #freenode
[03:15] <DaemonicApathy> Never mind, found the old release. Thanks, devnull_.
[03:15] <HonestAbe> anyone have any suggestions for a snappy pdf reader?
[03:16] <bazhang> HonestAbe, the default one evince

[03:16] <HonestAbe> documentviewer leaves something to be desired
[03:16] <HonestAbe> thanks bazhang

[03:16] <bazhang> HonestAbe, apt-cache search term to find something you like
[03:16] <rushboy> I have git installed on ubuntu 11.10 but now i need to look into the git directory , how do i do it ? any suggestions ?
[03:17] <devnull_> jschall, the lagginess ?
[03:17] <jschall> devnull_: but it wasn't a delay, it was just laggy
[03:17] <devnull_> okay ... the recommendation when something like that happens is to try and restart unity
[03:17] <devnull_> unity --replace should do the trick
[03:18] <devnull_> rushboy, hmmm ... not sure where it puts git ... maybe in /var somewhere .. or /usr/lib/
[03:19] <iFlip> Has anyone messed around with RouterBoard and Debian distro?
[03:19] <somsip> rushboy: it's install in /usr/bin/git but I guess you mean the .git folder of the cloned repo?
[03:20] <devnull_> somsip, where does ubuntu put the git repo that is being served ... i think that is what he needs
[03:21] <somsip> devnull_: whereever it's checked out to. Am I missing something in the question?

[03:22] <datruth> no djbdns ppl?
[03:22] <somsip> devnull_: ah. not sure then. It's been a while since I did that, and then I used gitolite or something
[03:22] <devnull_> i have a good question ... i have a trinity APU ... dual core with built in GPU ... my cpu monitor ... is that just the processor or also the GPU ?
=== mydogssnameisrud is now known as monkeyjuice
[03:22] <bazhang> datruth, wrong place I told you
[03:22] <iFlip> bazhang no, its a RouterBoard 532A
[03:23] <bazhang> ##networking or #freenode datruth
[03:23] <rushboy> somsip: actually i want to upload a local folder onto github ? can u help me on this ? I want to add the folder to : https://github.com/rushboy52/core
[03:23] <bazhang> iFlip, debian only? or ubuntu as well
[03:23] <iFlip> bazhang I was in networking - there a bit fussy tonight. I figured maybe a Linux related distro someone might know
[03:23] <devnull_> jschall, logitech mouse ?
[03:23] <jschall> devnull_: razor
[03:24] <bazhang> iFlip, the ##networking was to datruth
[03:24] <rushboy> somsip: yes maybe i am looking for the .git folder of the cloned repo
[03:24] <somsip> rushboy: git clone {repo}; cd {repo}; mkdir newdir; git add newdir; git commit -m 'Message'; git push; But you should fnid a nice tutorial really
[03:24] <devnull_> jschall, check the x log and see if there are any errors for the mouse
=== Paradigm|2 is now known as ultraparadigm
[03:24] <iFlip> bazhang either one... I read people loading Debian, but if anyone had tried Ubuntu I would be open to success story
[03:25] <ultraparadigm> Yes, that worked like a charm
[03:25] <jschall> devnull_: i guarantee you the mouse is fine. fine in kde, fine while not moving windows, fine now that the window thing seems to have resolved itself.
[03:25] <jschall> devnull_: rebooting, i want to see what removing plymouth-theme-ubuntu-text does
[03:25] <gnuskool> ubuntu phone is the biznis
[03:26] <HonestAbe> have you tried it out?
[03:26] <ultraparadigm> I had to return my old ATI HD video card because it turns out it doesn't work in 12.10 and I tried it in 12.04 and it works but not the opengl.  :-(    It was already using legacy drivers when i bought it bran new.  So I got a NVidia GTX and I am happy now.
[03:26] <gnuskool> nah, just vids
[03:26] <bazhang> gnuskool, #ubuntu-phone
[03:26] <gnuskool> thx
[03:29] <devnull_> ultraparadigm, what card doesn't work in 12.10 ?
[03:29] <jschall> devnull_: well, i got it to just display all the text properly, and that is definitely preferable to the brokenness that was going on by default
[03:29] <devnull_> jschall, i bet
[03:30] <devnull_> as long as that issue with the windows is resolved atm you should be okay

[03:36] <jschall> devnull_: this is with ati?
[03:36] <jschall> devnull_: oh damn, the laggy windows are back
[03:36] <devnull_> unity --replace
[03:36] <devnull_> yea
[03:37] <devnull_> well having composite on the desktop makes gaming a little harder ... i think i need to launch a second X server with no composite to get some more performance
[03:37] <devnull_> and i already enabled opengl3 by using the 3.7.1 kernel
[03:38] <devnull_> but i am not using the proprietary drivers
[03:43] <jschall> devnull_: well, i'm going to go try kde distros.
[03:43] <jschall> devnull_: i lasted almost three hours this time! a record.
[03:44] <devnull_> hehe ... it took me a lil to get used to unity and i have been using gnome for to many years
[03:44] <devnull_> you can install a kde desktop if you would like
[03:45] <jschall> devnull_: no, i'd prefer not having all of the out-of-place junk from the gnome installation
[03:49] <devnull_> jschall, ah ... you mean like primarily using qt software instead of the gtk software that ubuntu uses
[03:49] <jschall> devnull_: right. having both just gets you a huge number of redundant applications
[03:49] <HonestAbe> jschall try the xfce side of the force
[03:50] <devnull_> sure
[03:50] <devnull_> yea xfce is pretty nice .. i must say ... but it isn't kde in anyway
[03:50] <ActionParsnip> devnull_: completely different base :)
[03:50] <devnull_> yup

[03:55] <jschall> devnull_: yeah they're really damn annoying.
[03:55] <jschall> devnull_: especially since half of the applications have them and half of them don't
[03:56] <devnull_> yea depends if they are gtk native or not
[03:56] <devnull_> saves a bit of space though i must say

[04:46] <rushboy> Can anyone please help me with this : how do i copy a directory from one a source to a destination in ubuntu ?

[04:48] <ubottu> Guest90518: It's not technically our business, but we'd like to tell you that IRC'ing as root is a Very Bad Idea (tm). After all, doing anything as root when root is not needed is bad, and especially bad with software that connects to the Internet.
[04:49] <ActionParsnip> pep0: enable the partner repo either in /etc/apt/sources.list or use software centre
[04:49] <boriseto> ActionParship: I know, but it does everything for him, without having to remove and then install...

[04:51] <boriseto> pep0: oh, well in that case, stick to whatever ActionParsnip told you.
[04:51] <ActionParsnip> pep0: if you use chrome, you don't need any flash packages installed, it uses it's own

[05:11] <hexstatik> hello there, i am new to linux and need major help with ati/amd drivers. Here is a post to summarise it: http://askubuntu.com/questions/235605/xubuntu-12-10-amd-catalyst-12-11-beta-11-installation-not-working-how-to-recove
[05:12] <ogist> hex
[05:12] <hexstatik> yes
[05:12] <ogist> i can help you
[05:12] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HybridGraphics  may help
[05:12] <hexstatik> please do
[05:12] <ogist> dont listen to that
[05:12] <hexstatik> no i dont have hybrid graphics
[05:12] <ogist> ill help ya
[05:12] <ogist> i need to find the website
[05:12] <ogist> sec
[05:12] <FloodBot1> ogist: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[05:12] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: I suspect you will have a lot of issues there, dual GPUs are a headache
[05:13] <hexstatik> is radeon hd 6950
[05:13] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: good, the gpu is also liked by the xorg in quantal :)
[05:14] <ogist> ok
[05:14] <ogist> type the following in the console
[05:14] <ogist> sudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx
[05:15] <hexstatik> im on guest user rightnow
[05:15] <ogist> that's ok i think
[05:15] <ogist> as long as you type sudo
[05:15] <hexstatik> and im not able to change to to my primary user in terminal
[05:15] <hexstatik> u
[05:15] <ogist> it will ask for your password
[05:16] <ogist> after you type that...
[05:16] <ogist> sudo apt-get update
[05:16] <ogist> and then
[05:16] <ogist> sudo apt-get upgrade
[05:16] <ogist> and finally
[05:16] <ogist> sudo apt-get install fglrx-legacy
[05:17] <ogist> after all that is complete, reboot
[05:17] <hexstatik> shoot, says i must be root
[05:17] <hexstatik> i tried sudo su
[05:17] <hexstatik> sudo: unable to change to sudoers gid: Operation not permitted
[05:17] <ogist> do you not have the root pass?
[05:17] <dr_willis> dont use sudo su.   just sudo -s   for a root shell
[05:18] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[05:18] <ogist> su = switch user
[05:18] <Zenexer> I'm trying to compress a folder into a .tar.xz file while passing some custom parameters to xz.  I made an intermediate .tar, but xz doesn't seem to want to compress anything.  It looks like it's always trying to decompress, because no matter what I feed it, I get this error: "xz: File format not recognized"
[05:18] <ogist> hexstatik, it's because proprietary drivers do not work on the latest version of X
[05:18] <hexstatik> action: Ubuntu 12.10 \n \l
[05:18] <Zenexer> I've tried various flags, and settled with -kt9z
[05:18] <ActionParsnip> ogist: works here with nvidia
[05:19] <hexstatik> ogist: thats why i got the beta 12.11 drivers they do
[05:19] <ogist> ActionParsnip, ati is what hexstatik has
[05:19] <hexstatik> i tried 12.10 ones before that
[05:19] <Zenexer> -z should force compression, but either it's trying to decompress anyway, or it wants something specific.
[05:19] <TXRoadkill> Ubuntu has apparently stopped supporting the Seamonkey Project.  I use Composer all the time.  Does anyone know of a good substitute WYSIWYG web authoring tool which 12.10 supports?
[05:19] <ogist> http://www.unixmen.com/ubuntu-12-10-and-amd-catalyst-problem-solved/
[05:19] <ogist> i actually did this today and it worked for me
[05:20] <hexstatik> guest-9jUhIB@comp:~$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:makson96/fglrx
[05:20] <hexstatik> sudo: unable to change to sudoers gid: Operation not permitted
[05:20] <Zenexer> I've also tried doing it through stdio as the manpage demonstrates, but the example doesn't work for me.
[05:20] <ActionParsnip> ogist: hexstatik has a 6950, that is for 2xxx 3xxx and 4xxx
[05:20] <ogist> oh
[05:20] <ogist> hmm
[05:20] <hexstatik> yea i have hd 6950 radeon 2gb
[05:21] <ogist> sorry
[05:21] <dr_willis> hexstatik:  you are the guest user? or a normal user right now?
[05:21] <hexstatik> guest
[05:21] <ActionParsnip> ogist: tried Precise? It is LTS so supported long after even Raring is EOL
[05:21] <hexstatik> cant login to my normal user it just takes me rightback to log in screen afther the screen goes black for a awhile
[05:22] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: what is the output of:  groups
[05:22] <hexstatik> guest-9jUhIB
[05:22] <Zenexer> Can someone do me a favor, and try to compress a file with xz on 12.10, and let me know if it works?
[05:22] <dr_willis> hexstatik:  guest cant sudo. try logging as your user on the console
[05:22] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: oh, then you won't be able to do much at all
[05:23] <hexstatik> dr_willis: guest-9jUhIB
[05:23] <hexstatik> er
[05:23] <hexstatik> dr_willis: Password:
[05:23] <hexstatik> setgid: Operation not permitted
[05:23] <hexstatik> when i try to su username
[05:23] <ogist> ActionParsnip, what?
[05:23] <ogist> i havent tried precise
[05:23] <dr_willis> hexstatik:  LOGIN at the console as your user... not under guest
[05:23] <ActionParsnip> ogist: sorry, was meant for hexstatik
[05:24] <Zenexer> Does xz have a file size limit?
[05:24] <ActionParsnip> Zenexer: shouldn't do as far as I know
[05:24] <Zenexer> It doesn't like my 32 GB tar archive.
[05:24] <hexstatik> dr_willis: ok should i get on irc on diffrent machine? im using the guest account to be on irc rightnow
[05:24] <ActionParsnip> Zenexer: could try in 2 stages. Make a tar of the data then gzip the tar
[05:25] <Zenexer> Seems to be working with the same arguments on a text file.
[05:25] <ActionParsnip> Zenexer: ah
[05:25] <dr_willis> hexstatik:  you can irc from the console if you wanted to
[05:25] <ogist> I installed cairo-dock earlier and clicked to include the enlightenment window manager, how do i know if enlightenment is working?
[05:25] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: tried bzip or 7zip etc?
[05:25] <hexstatik> yea i have irssi
[05:26] <hexstatik> action: for what puropose?
[05:26] <Zenexer> Eh, never mind, it's not working on a text file either; just looked like it was working the first time
[05:26] <Zenexer> Same error: file format not recognized
[05:26] <dr_willis> ogist:  did you select enlightmnt at the login screen?
[05:26] <ActionParsnip> Zenexer: ah, good test
[05:27] <ForSpareParts> Is there a way to prevent the top menu bar from appearing over fullscreen applications maximized on another screen when the app loses focus?
[05:27] <ForSpareParts> Under Unity, that is.
[05:27] <Zenexer> Ah.  I think -t was throwing it off--I have to run an integrity test as a separate command, after the file is already compressed, I think.
[05:28] <kunji> Hmm, in case anyone is interested, upgrading from 12.04 to 12.10 fixed the wireless problems I was asking about this morning.  I can't say anything conclusive about exactly what the fix was though, unfortunately it was a spray and pray approach to fixing it.
[05:28] <Zenexer> I thought I tried it without that, but I guess not.
[05:32] <hexstatik> dr_willis, sorry i went afk for a second
[05:33] <ActionParsnip> kunji: glad you got the gold. shame the LTS wasn't up to it :(
[05:33] <hexstatik> not really sure how i can run irssi, and terminal at the same time
[05:33] <xenome> can I change the grub fb image (tux pengium) displayed during boot w/o having to rebuild the kernel?
[05:33] <ActionParsnip> xenome: how do you mean 'fb image'?
[05:34] <ViperXL75> hi
[05:34] <hexstatik> ill just use the laptop for irc, brb
[05:34] <xenome> the boot images displayed in the top left corner
[05:34] <xenome> for my omap4 install, I get two penguins
[05:34] <ViperXL75> I'm logged in on the Ubuntu Gui. How do i run a program as Root without having to go in the Terminal first to type "su [progname]"  ?  Can you do that directly from the Gui?
[05:35] <ActionParsnip> ViperXL75: press ALT+F2 and run:  gksudo appname
[05:35] <ActionParsnip> xenome: Is it using Grub2?
[05:35] <ViperXL75> ah. tx
[05:35] <rollitup> hi guys
[05:35] <kubuntuser> hello
[05:36] <phax> Hi guys I updated to Ubuntu 11.10 and  the wireless does not connect to my old profile, or shows me surrounding networks...but I can use iwlist scan to get the list..so it seems the drver is ok..is there any service i need to start ?
[05:36] <rollitup> i am trying to create a symlink but not been able to achieve exactly what i want
[05:36] <ActionParsnip> phax: which release did you upgrade from?
[05:36] <xenome> nope, uboot
[05:36] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: what are you trying to achieve?
[05:36] <ActionParsnip> xenome: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[05:37] <phax> ActionParsnip, 10.0.4 to 11.0.4 to 11.10
[05:37] <rollitup> i have created a vhosts dir /var/www/icw.dev and i wish to link this to a dir /home/instant/public_html/icw
[05:37] <xenome> ubuntu 12.04 LTS
[05:37] <xenome> i'm using the arm version
[05:37] <rollitup> so i tried this command sudo ln -s /home/instant/public_html/icw/
[05:37] <ActionParsnip> phax: you shouldn't upgrade 10.04 ro 11.04, you need to upgrade to maverick first
[05:38] <vitaliko> dr_willis: im back
[05:38] <ogist> how come when i create a shortcut to quake2 executable, it just opens and closes in <1sec
[05:38] <phax> ActionParsnip, well without network connectivity not sure what to do now ?
[05:38] <rollitup> it did create a link but not exactly what i want for example now when i type icw.dev it takes me to the web directory where icw dir is shown
[05:38] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: so the intention is to link the icw.dev folder so it appears to have the same data as the folder in your home folder?
[05:38] <rollitup> instead of showing the index file that is placed in the icw dir
[05:38] <ogist> also when i try to open quake2 from the cairo-dock folder menu, it tries to open it with a package viewer
[05:38] <phax> ActionParsnip, but why is it wrong to expect this to work ?
[05:38] <rollitup> yes
[05:39] <kubuntuser> anyone know if it's possible to broadcast on a shoutcast server with ubuntu ?
[05:39] <ActionParsnip> phax: because yu leapfrogged a release
[05:39] <ActionParsnip> phax: you could in factg upgrade 10.04 to 10.10  or direct to 12.04 (LTS to LTS)
[05:39] <ActionParsnip> kubuntuser: look into icecast
[05:40] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: sudo ln -s /home/instant/public_html/icw /var/www/icw.dev
[05:40] <kubuntuser> ActionParsnip: yes but it's possible to broadcast with a player ?
[05:40] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: sudo ln -s <source> <dest>
[05:40] <rollitup> ok
[05:40] <ActionParsnip> kubuntuser: vlc can
[05:40] <ogist> how do i make a shortcut to a file and put it on my desktop? i clicked on quake2 and chose make link, and i put it on the desktop, but it doesnt work...
[05:40] <kubuntuser> ActionParsnip: mmm broadcast too ?
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> phax: if you remove the wifi network from within gconf and reboot, can you connect to it?
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> kubuntuser: maybe, not sure
[05:41] <rollitup> ActionParsnip: i get this error ln: failed to create symbolic link `/var/www/icw.dev/icw': File exists
[05:41] <kubuntuser> ActionParsnip: i try now
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> ogist: you could make a .desktop file for it, you can then have a nice icon too :)
[05:41] <dr_willis> ogist:  easiest way is to make a bash script that runs the game
[05:41] <rollitup> maybe i have to remove the earlier created symlinks and then try the command again ?
[05:41] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: ok, what is the output of:   file /var/www/icw.dev/icw
[05:41] <ogist> :)
[05:42] <rollitup> ActionParsnip: do u mean the output i get in the terminal ?
[05:42] <phax> ActionParsnip, how do i correctly upgrade to the 12.04 and instal all missing deps from cmd line ?
[05:42] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: yes, 'file' is a command
[05:42] <vitaliko> ok, so can anyone please help, I installed 12.11 ati drivers and now i cant login to my normal user, guest works  fine. Tried purging the drivers and reverting back to x.org drivers and no luck...ive spent so much time on this ish
[05:42] <phax> I can use the wired network

[05:44] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: I thought the symlink was just to /var/www/icw.dev ?
[05:44] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: cool, the link is made :)
=== vitaliko is now known as hexstatik_
[05:45] <hexstatik_> my specs are: i5 2500k, hd radeon 6950, 8gb
[05:45] <rollitup> ActionParsnip: the link is made but when i type icw.dev in the browser it shows the icw directory but not the index.html within this dir
[05:46] <rollitup> ActionParsnip: there is an index.html  within /home/instant/public_html/icw
[05:47] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: does apache follow links?
[05:47] <rollitup> sorry i didn't get what you meant to ask ?
[05:47] <iseer> Could i please get somebody to take a look at my question on askubuntu?
[05:47] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: the i5-2500k is a sandybridge
[05:47] <dr_willis> i thought apache had a security setting to not follow links
[05:48] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: so you have an Intel HD 3000 in the CPU. You have a switchable GPU setup
[05:48] <iseer> are we allowed to provide links in this channel?
[05:48] <hexstatik_> ok
[05:49] <ogist> Does anyone here have cairo-dock? That little 4-screen switch thing disappeared
[05:49] <ActionParsnip> iseer: sure
[05:49] <dr_willis> use the dock settings to readd it perhaps ogist
[05:49] <hexstatik_> ActionParsnip: when i was in gnome under software courses it did show that my radeon was the active card
[05:50] <hexstatik_> if thats what you were implying
[05:50] <iseer> could somebody please have a look at this and see if they know what is wrong and/or how to fix it http://askubuntu.com/questions/237658/can-somebody-help-fix-ubuntu-12-04-being-stuck-at-black-screen-on-regular-boot
[05:50] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: all I can recommend is read the ubuntu hybrid graphics page. If you can, disable the inbuilt GPU or just remove the ATI and you'll be fine
[05:50] <ogist> dr_willis, it was something that was not even on the dock
[05:51] <ogist> a little thing with 4 screens
[05:51] <ogist> i clicked show-desktop somehow and now it is gone
[05:51] <hexstatik_> initially i used the open sourse drivers and they worked fine exept for some performance degradation
[05:51] <rollitup> ActionParsnip: is this the only limit to creating symlinks ?
[05:51] <ogist> the workspace switcher thingy
[05:51] <ActionParsnip> iseer: 3.7 kernel isn't supported here
[05:51] <hexstatik_> then i used 12.10 ati and found out they're not supported
[05:51] <rollitup> i mean it would link to the dir but won't show the index.html file within it ?
[05:51] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: limit in what way?
[05:52] <hexstatik_> ActionParsnip: ok ill try and see there is a way to disable in bios, but i think i would  already have that
[05:52] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: a link will show all the files you have in the folder. You may need to chown the linked files a little so that the service can access it
[05:52] <ogist> ok i fixed it
[05:52] <iseer> ActionParsnip: what is the latest kernel i am under the impression that i will need at least 3.6.3 to use my inbuilt dvbt card
[05:52] <ogist> :)
[05:52] <ogist> ubuntu is sweet lookin
[05:53] <iseer> latest kernel that is suppoted *

[05:53] <rollitup> chown root /home/instant/public_html/icw/index.html  is this how i should try ?
[05:53] <ActionParsnip> iseer: you will need to install Raring to get the 3.7 kernel but it is pre-release unttil April
[05:54] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: not root, look at the other files in /var/www
[05:54] <rollitup> ok

[05:54] <dr_willis> hexstatik_:  im not even sure what your situation is. no need to msg me. im at work and may have to leave irc at a moments notice
[05:55] <hexstatik_> you were just helping me 5 min ago,
[05:55] <hexstatik_> ok, so can anyone please help, I installed 12.11 ati drivers and now i cant login to my normal user, guest works  fine. Tried purging the drivers and reverting back to x.org drivers and no luck...ive spent so much time on this ish
[05:55] <iseer> ActionParsnip: is there any prevalent bugs in raring that would make regular use difficult or is it usable?
[05:55] <dr_willis> and i help dozens of people a day. and my irc log is about 10 lines of history
[05:55] <hexstatik_> using ati radeon hd 6950
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: if you make a fresh user in root recovery mode and add it to the sudo group, then log in as the new user, is it ok?
[05:56] <ActionParsnip> iseer: its pre-release so its a bit of a mixed bag
[05:57] <iseer> ActionParsnip: im fine with it a bit buggy aslong as i can use my wireless and boot lol, i have to boot through recovery mode now
[05:57] <sin_tax> quick cron question.... this doesn't seem to be working so I must be doing something wrong: @reboot rtorrent /data01/torrents/start  <--- should that not run '/data01/torrents/start' as the user 'rtorrent' on reboot?
[05:58] <hexstatik_> ActionParsnip: I can try, but the point being i have spent alot of time setting up that user the way i wanted
[05:58] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: well if you can't log in as the user its not much good is it...
[05:58] <hexstatik_> true
[05:59] <hexstatik_> i mean i can login from the terminal

[06:00] <dr_willis> you could reset all the problem useres settings as a test hexstatik_    but you will have to figure out what setting is the issue. or just reset them all
[06:00] <jirido> You mean the name?
[06:00] <ActionParsnip> jirido: all of it
[06:01] <ActionParsnip> jirido: all the boxes you typed in, use all lower case letters
[06:01] <jirido> I think al ofit yes
[06:01] <ViperXL75> In the name of all that is unholy! How do I check which command to start K3b burner? I need to start it as Root, but can't find the correct command to start it up with.  :(
[06:01] <jirido> I did
[06:01] <ActionParsnip> jirido: check, if you used all lower case then I suggest you MD5 test the ISO so that you know it is error free and complete
[06:01] <dr_willis> ViperXL75:  its 'k3b' last time i tried
[06:02] <jirido> I used unetbootin to put it on stick
[06:02] <ActionParsnip> jirido: if you have web access in liveCD, run:  sudo apt-get install ubiquity gparted     and it will upgrade the installer to the latest version. Then run it
[06:02] <dr_willis> ViperXL75:  or see what the k3b.desktop file launches
=== ericab is now known as ericab_away
[06:02] <jirido> I dont have any cd
[06:03] <ViperXL75> dr_willis: thing is, I start it from that Alt-F2 interface. I never get a hold of the shortcut itself.
[06:03] <jirido> But ill check md5
[06:03] <hexstatik_> okay, so if i were to reinstall ubuntu or make a new user, what whould be the best driver to install to get the most performance from radeon hf6950? Using 12.10 ubuntu....
[06:03] <ActionParsnip> jirido: you don't need a CD, you have the USB :)
[06:04] <hexstatik_> mainly for GUI performance(im kind of a freak when it comes to smooth actions in GUI) and gaming as well
[06:04] <jirido> should i run :  sudo apt-get install ubiquity gparted in the installer or..
[06:05] <rollitup> ActionParsnip: i chown 'ed instance /home/instant/public_html/icw but still it does not show up the index file
[06:05] <rollitup> sorry instant
[06:05] <ActionParsnip> rollitup: i'd ask in the apache channel :)
[06:05] <rollitup> ok
[06:05] <rollitup> that sounds good
[06:05] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: your guest user is ok, so my guess is the driver is ok. Worth exploring
[06:05] <chovy> does ubuntu have newer software than debian?
[06:05] <dr_willis> !latest
[06:05] <ubottu> Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[06:06] <gonzojive> I upgraded my old ubuntu machine, where the root file system is RAID 1 ext3, and upon restart I'm given a grub prompt
[06:06] <gonzojive> what do I do next?
[06:07] <jirido> ActionParsnip, Should i run  sudo apt-get install ubiquity gparted during the install or on the mashine i use to put the iso on the stick?
[06:08] <ogist> ok so how do i make a desktop file

=== XenGi is now known as XenGi_
[06:08] <ActionParsnip> jirido: then run the installer as normal
[06:08] <hexstatik_> ActionParsnip: actually now that you say that it might not be anything to do with the video card drivers. What else do you think it could be...again the issue is that i try to login to my user and login screen and it just kicks me back out
[06:08] <ActionParsnip> ogist: I always copy one from ~/.config/autostart then modify
[06:09] <jirido> Ok
[06:09] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: settings in your users home maybe
[06:09] <hexstatik_> where should i look
[06:09] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: the new user will have vanilla settings
[06:09] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik_: boot to root recovery and run:  adduser testname sudo
[06:09] <hexstatik_> ok brb

[06:10] <gIneeRing> ??
[06:10] <ActionParsnip> iseer: april being the (4)th month in 20(13)...hence 13.04   being the version number
[06:11] <gIneeRing> hey ActionParsnip, I tried FB it didnt work
[06:11] <gIneeRing> lol
[06:11] <iseer> ActionParsnip: thanks i didnt know that i'm quite new to ubuntu. aslong as it boots, and can run python3.2 im fine, if bumblebee works on it that is a bonus because it is an optimus laptop but thank you so much :D
[06:11] <gIneeRing> I need some assistance with my Ubuntu 12.04 though... it does not turn on my W-Lan card - Sony Vaio

[06:13] <iseer> ActionParsnip: I have looked around and couldn't find anything to do that but would be willing to because i don't really think my gpu has much on the inel inbuilt graphics as it is only a gtx630m
[06:14] <iseer> gIneeRing: do you know what wlan card you are using
[06:14] <jirido> It does start up live anyway
[06:14] <ActionParsnip> jirido: 512Mb is minimal, you'll be ok. Could use XFCE or LXDE to reduce used resources
[06:14] <jirido> its lubuntu
[06:15] <ActionParsnip> gIneeRing: what wifi chip are you using?
[06:15] <ActionParsnip> jirido: should be fine. LXDE is dead light
[06:15] <jirido> can i install from inside the livecd?
[06:15] <ActionParsnip> gonzojive: http://www.chrissearle.org/blog/technical/booting_grub_shell  may help

[06:15] <ogist> ActionParsnip, :)
[06:15] <inflames> is there some place to go to get better help with cinnamon? should i try #mint?

[06:35] <Tigerx1078> hi where can i go to see what other people are talking about what system they use to run ubuntu on?
[06:36] <somsip> Tigerx1078: you can chat in #ubuntu-offtopic if that helps?
[06:36] <Tigerx1078> trying to figure out which version i need for my system
[06:37] <somsip> Tigerx1078: what choices are youi considering?
[06:37] <Tigerx1078> like a server with a gui inside it
[06:37] <somsip> Tigerx1078: for production, or just dev/testing?
[06:37] <Tigerx1078> just for home
[06:38] <somsip> Tigerx1078: how will you connect to it - with a monitor or over LAN with SSH or similar?
[06:38] <jirido> ActionParsnip, the copy was ok and i did  sudo apt-get install ubiquity gparted but still the installer hangs on "Who are you?" dialog after the files are copied.. in taskmanager only lxtask use cpu
[06:38] <Tigerx1078> both
[06:38] <somsip> Tigerx1078: how much RAM?
[06:38] <iseer> ActionParsnip: I'm installing it now I'll let you know how it goes
[06:39] <Tigerx1078> got plenty
[06:39] <Tigerx1078> i belive 4gb
[06:40] <somsip> Tigerx1078: well, your options are wide open really. 32 bit with PAE kernel or 64 bit is probably a better recommendation. If it's not production you dont really need LTS of 12.04, but it might be more stable. And either server install, then put a GUI on top, or a lightweight desktop such as lubuntu or xubuntu. No firm answer really
[06:40] <fulcan> what is the easist/best way to launch a script into a users xsession? i.e. from ssh make firefox open on the users desktop?
[06:41] <Tigerx1078> i see somsip i tried 12.04 server its choppy in the gui
[06:41] <Tigerx1078> its a p4 2.4 ghz with 4 or more gb of ram

[06:42] <somsip> Tigerx1078: sorry - what WM on the desktop...
[06:42] <Tigerx1078> dell dimension 4600
[06:42] <Tigerx1078> and i added a graffics card to
[06:42] <somsip> Tigerx1078: no - when GUI was choppy, what GUI were you using, and how did you set this up given server edition does not come with a GUI IIRC
[06:43] <Tigerx1078> i did it in the comannd like
[06:43] <Tigerx1078> to install the gui
[06:43] <Tigerx1078> gnome
[06:43] <Tigerx1078> i'm on a differnt puter at the moment
[06:46] <somsip> Tigerx1078: If you want help, you will need to give more details. Do you want to get this GUI sorted out, or reinstall a different version?
[06:46] <vnc786> running kubunut 12.04 through LTSP when i am trying to save some files on desktop it doesn't show up on desktop ?
[06:46] <Tigerx1078> would a differnt version help like a older one somsip?
=== tux is now known as Guest59356
[06:47] <somsip> Tigerx1078: difficult to tell without knowing what the real problem is. If the current GUI is choppy, using a different GUI will possibly give a different result.
[06:48] <Tigerx1078> ok
[06:48] <ogist> wow
[06:48] <ogist> i cant even make a desktop shortcut work
[06:48] <ogist> linux is tough stuff
[06:48] <somsip> Tigerx1078: simple answer may be to put a lightweight version on, such as lubuntu or xubuntu. If it's easy for you to try that, it may give you a solution
=== Guest59356 is now known as Elpie
[06:49] <vnc786> can i ask directly question here ?
[06:49] <ogist> yeah
[06:50] <Tigerx1078> ok will those versions work for being a server somsip?
[06:50] <vnc786> running kubunut 12.04 through LTSP when i am trying to save some files on desktop it doesn't show up on desktop ?
[06:50] <somsip> Tigerx1078: what do you mean by 'server'? What will you be running?
[06:51] <Tigerx1078> file server,webserver
[06:51] <somsip> Tigerx1078: yes - it'll make no difference really. It might just make it easier for you to manage if sometimes you will have direct access with a monitor, rather than if you only had SSH
[06:51] <hexstatik> ActionParsnip: i fixed it, basically all i had to do was to change ownership of Xauthority
[06:52] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: sweet, been running GUI apps with sudo by any chance?
[06:52] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: does:  sudo gedit    or:   sudo nautilus   sound familiar?

[06:53] <ActionParsnip> hexstatik: you use gksudo
[06:53] <somsip> Tigerx1078: no probs. Not a definitive answer though. No real right or wrong thing to do.
[06:53] <hexstatik> yes
[06:53] <hexstatik> now ive reinforced my knowledge:)
[06:54] <Tigerx1078> ok somsip i'll try a older version form the web that people talk about if i can find any and give those a try as well
[06:55] <hexstatik> i think its time to try installing the drivers again
[06:56] <somsip> Tigerx1078: no need to use an older version. Just try a lighter window manager if that was the thing that was bothering you. eg lubuntu, xubuntu
[06:57] <Tigerx1078> ok thanks somsip i belive it was.  since i could not install the drivers for the grafics card from restriced drivers

[07:09] <fulcan> how do i launch a script into a users xsession?  i.e. from ssh make firefox open on the users desktop?
[07:10] <somsip> rushboy: way OT for here. Basically you would clone it, create an empty github for it, add a new remote being the github repo, assign local:master to github:master, and push all of the code. You need to find an online tutorial that explains this better though.

[08:17] <sam__> I'm looking to automate some ubuntu installs and have them install some extra packages e.g.  Eclipse, tomcat etc… how best can i script the install to be unattended.  BTW the installs have to be self contained on the CD or USB and work when there is no internet connect?
[08:18] <NuSuey> ah, is there a way how to fix the hall32.dll (or is it hall.dll) windows boot .. without using the windows installation CD? (i'm asking because it would fu.k up my GRUB)
[08:18] <somsip> sam__: I've never heard of this before, but: http://fai-project.org/
[08:20] <mladoux> NuSuey, it might be easier to use the windows installation cd to fix it, then use the ubuntu install cd to repair grub afterwards.
[08:20] <trijntje> sam__: you could take a look at ubuntu-defaults-builder, which allows you to create a custom iso image
[08:20] <trijntje> However, due to a bug this will not work for Quantal 64 bit
[08:21] <NuSuey> mladoux: yeah. but last time, when It threw my GRUB into trash, I had quite some problems to put the grub back in :p
[08:22] <Ben64> NuSuey: you could back up grub and put it back :D
[08:22] <mladoux> NuSuey: do you have /boot on it's own partition?
[08:23] <mladoux> because if you do, a real easy way to fix it is to run the ubuntu livecd, then mount your boot partition to /boot on the live cd, then run grub-install or grub-setup with /dev/sda ( no number, replace sda with your configuration ) as the target
[08:24] <mladoux> can't remember if it's grub-setup or grub-install
[08:24] <mladoux> I had to do it a couple days ago.
[08:24] <Ben64> back up is easier
[08:24] <mladoux> relatively
[08:25] <NuSuey> mladoux: nope :/ but.. I'll probably try it.. yeah. last time I did it so, *nearst* helped me.. booted the partition, did some mount this and that.. grub-setup.. and voila
[08:25] <mladoux> mbr is just the first 512 on your hdd, i think
[08:25] <Ben64> dd if=<boot drive> of=boot_backup bs=512 count=1
[08:25] <sam__> somsip: thanx!  that looks like a nice project!
[08:25] <Ben64> or similar
[08:25] <sam__> might work..
[08:25] <sam__> i was busy looking at AptoCD
[08:26] <mladoux> yeah, but you want to know for sure before you do it, backing up isn't really easier, just geekier

[09:01] <pigeta> i do before (09:27:36)
[09:01] <Sehnder_> Hey folks, looking for a bit of insight to solve an install problem. Running windows 7 x64 and trying to install Ubuntu 12.04 x32. Using LiLi USB creator I can create x64 for both 12.10 and 12.04 and be recognized when booting, but it is not detected if I use x32 instead.
[09:01] <Sehnder_> Is that a windows version to linux version issue when booting, or a usb creator issue.
[09:02] <MonkeyDust> pigeta  better repeat it, this is a busy channel and some people entered after 9:27
[09:02] <dr_willis> Sehnder_:  you did verify the md5s of the images? try a tool other then LiLi?

[09:03] <pigeta> cant find
[09:03] <Sehnder_> Do you have any recommendations for a tool to mount the install other than lili?
[09:03] <Sehnder_> Not familiar with md5 images or how to verify
[09:03] <Sehnder_> I am very much a novice
[09:03] <dr_willis> Sehnder_:  i fine most anything at the pendrivelinux site better then lili

[09:04] <dr_willis> if 64bit works.. why not use 64bit?
[09:04] <HonestAbe> att is well deserving of a dickpunching
[09:04] <HonestAbe> whoops, wrong channel, but my sentiments remain
[09:05] <Sehnder_> 64 bit for Ubuntu had some major issues for me
[09:05] <Sehnder_> I could not get the video drivers to work properly despite using four different sets of drivers
[09:06] <Sehnder_> I was told a stable release in 32 bit might have better odds for me
[09:06] <dr_willis> hmm. cant say ive had any video driver issues with  64bit in years
[09:06] <Sehnder_> the default drivers can't load anything but using alternative drivers removes the side bars and launch items from the screen
[09:07] <Sehnder_> As I didn't know the command to restart and couldnt click the button I had to do a hard reset, giving me a kernel crisis or some such
[09:07] <coreyb> anyone know why fubuntu is invite only right now?

[09:09] <dr_willis> coreyb:  havent tried.. you can regiester and try
[09:09] <dr_willis> krz:  it installs to a file/dir on the windows partition.  but once running its mostly the same

[09:12] <dr_willis> try gksudo gparted ?

[10:12] <savagecroc> llutz: https://gist.github.com/e2568d6bccf8e615e82e
[10:12] <llutz> savagecroc: pgrep never gives its own pid back, so you got 2 macthcing processes running
[10:13] <savagecroc> llutz: it's really strange when i run it through bash, it doesnt
[10:13] <llutz> matching*
[10:13] <savagecroc> llutz: when i execute through an ssh channel, i get two pids coming back
[10:13] <hexstatik_> umm whats super lol

[10:13] <hexstatik_> yea i tried
[10:13] <hexstatik_> didnt wokr
[10:14] <savagecroc> llutz: could it be that it relies on something in the bash environment?

[10:19] <savagecroc> llutz: oh interesting.. https://gist.github.com/40ea312cd05fb1bb887d
[10:19] <MonkeyDust> yolateng0  but not every (x)ubuntu fork is supported here, there are too many of them
[10:20] <llutz> savagecroc: ah, pgrep also finds the ngingx watchdog, you have to adjust your pattern
[10:21] <llutz> savagecroc: nonsense, ignore me
[10:21] <savagecroc> yeah.. i think that might be the SSH library i'm using

[10:22] <savagecroc> yeah it is
[10:22] <savagecroc> https://gist.github.com/2dd3769dba045ab28c0c << i changed it
[10:22] <savagecroc> and it's coming up with the command i ran.. + grep
[10:23] <savagecroc> so by default.. the ssh library must be using bash rather than the raw ssh channels like i thought it was

[10:31] <ikillcypher> :)
[10:31] <magico> ciao
[10:31] <ikillcypher> anyone has any idea how to copy windows which I downloaded 30 days trial iso into a usb stick :P Im currently on Ubuntu

[10:32] <MonkeyDust> ikillcypher  better ask in ##windows
[10:32] <ikillcypher> im currently on Ubuntu
[10:32] <ikillcypher> so I believe it is a software I have to use
[10:32] <MonkeyDust> ikillcypher  you want to make it installable?
[10:33] <ikillcypher> it is copying the whole iso into a usb and yes installable and bootable
[10:33] <ikillcypher> as I need it for work
[10:33] <MonkeyDust> ikillcypher  not sure if that's possible with windows
[10:33] <ikillcypher> you dont understand
[10:34] <ikillcypher> in windows if I want to copy ubuntu to my usb I use linuxusbcreator
[10:34] <ikillcypher> but for Ubuntu now I want to copy windows into my usb
[10:34] <ikillcypher> what do I use
[10:34] <MonkeyDust> ikillcypher  you want to boot windows from usb?
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[10:35] <ikillcypher> yes and install into my harddisk
[10:35] <ikillcypher> it is like installing from a cd
[10:35] <ikillcypher> but now I want to install from my usb
[10:35] <MonkeyDust> ikillcypher  not sure if that's possible with windows
[10:35] <ikillcypher> :S
[10:35] <igcek> hi, ive got 2 drives mounted in two folders... first is mounted on /home/foo and second is mounted on /home/foo/second_drive
[10:35] <ikillcypher> it is
[10:35] <ikillcypher> I did it before
[10:36] <igcek> everithing is then shared through samba over the network and mounted on ubuntu sistem...
[10:36] <hexstatik_> how i can i create an iso of my current install?
[10:36] <igcek> problem is i can only use the /hone/foo drive's max space
[10:36] <skooch> if you want to boot windows install disc off a usb stick, its as simple as partitioning it to ntfs and setting it bootable with bootsect.
[10:37] <skooch> then copying everything in the iso across
[10:37] <igcek> so if drive foo has 120 and second drive 40GB  i can only use 120GB
[10:37] <igcek> but i can record on any of them...
[10:38] <graydragon> hellos
[10:39] <graydragon> well i got a problym im still new to ubuntu
[10:41] <graydragon> not even shure this is working
[10:41] <dr_willis> and your issue is graydragon ?
[10:42] <graydragon> well i made the mistake of trying to install ubuntu 10.10 on to a external
[10:42] <MonkeyDust> 10.10 is no longer supported
[10:42] <dr_willis> ;)
[10:42] <bentinata> haha
[10:43] <zuppetto> salve
[10:43] <graydragon> so far from what i have found that i now have a grub boot loader on my xp internal
[10:43] <dr_willis> i install to external usb all the time. works well.. or at lease 11.x and 12.x has
[10:43] <graydragon> problym is windows is hybernated
[10:43] <zuppetto> qualcuno scrive in italiano?
[10:43] <MonkeyDust> !it
[10:43] <ubottu> Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie! (per entrare, scrivi « /join #ubuntu-it » senza virgolette)
[10:43] <dr_willis> yep. grub can go to the  internal hd if you dont tell it to use the external
[10:44] <zuppetto> thanks a lot!
[10:44] <zuppetto> -.-
[10:44] <graydragon> i found that out the hard way
[10:44] <Beifong> that's it then? grub-install and then delete partition
[10:44] <graydragon> well i need to keep whats on the internal hd
[10:45] <dr_willis> the windows hd?
[10:45] <graydragon> yes
[10:46] <bentinata>  
[10:46] <dr_willis> you should still be able to use  access the windows fileststems from the installed system or a live usb
[10:46] <graydragon> and well the windows partishion is in a hybernated state
[10:47] <bekks> Then you cannot mount it.
[10:47] <graydragon> im using a live usb atm
[10:47] <graydragon> correct
[10:47] <dr_willis> i think you can force it to mount
[10:47] <dr_willis> id check the ntfs-3g docs . im not sure of the option
[10:48] <graydragon> ok so is there a way to well repair it i have no idea how from what ive read id have to do some thing with mbr
[10:48] <UbuntuWarrior> hello
[10:49] <bekks> graydragon: Boot Windows, and shut it down instead of hiberbating.
[10:49] <graydragon> id love to
[10:49]  * dr_willis waits for more details...
[10:49] <graydragon> and greetings warrior
[10:50] <graydragon> ok ill try to give as mutch detail as i can
[10:50] <graydragon> first off its a netbook
[10:50] <bekks> graydragon: Or ensure that Windows will never ever boot from that disk, and just enforce mounting it using ntfs-3g. Not doing so may result in data loss, since the hibernated data may contain pending MFT data which were not written to the physical MFT yet. And changing data on the disk and resuming from hibernation after, may result in corrupting the filesystem.
[10:50] <bekks> I've summed it up... :P
[10:52] <graydragon> well i am so new to ubuntu that i hae to say im lost
[10:52] <dr_willis> boot system, shutdown not hibernate.. would be the   'best' fix
[10:52] <dr_willis> never use hibernate again. ;)
[10:53] <signal0r> guys. what am i doing wrong? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1512328/ my vpn dont work and i'm not sure what the problem is.

[10:57] <bentinata> I guess, you can't boot into windows?
[10:57] <graydragon> ok um how all i have to work with is my live usb thats it
[10:57] <bekks> graydragon: I told you both possible solutions already.

[11:04] <dr_willis> computerguy: what does it do exactly
[11:04] <graydragon> brb
[11:04] <dr_willis> hexstatik_: globaly at login or bootup
[11:05] <hexstatik_> either way will do really
[11:05] <hexstatik_> i just want it to spread to all programs
[11:05] <computerguy> ot goes up to the log in screen then i type of password and then when i hit enter it won't load anything it just loads only the desktop back ground..there will no icons nothing..then i have to hit power button to turn it off
[11:05] <dr_willis> it depends on whats uts doing.... hexstatik_
[11:05] <computerguy> it*
[11:05] <hexstatik_> there is a pastebin...it changes mouse sensitivity
[11:05] <bekks> abdul: You need a valid Junioer firmware image. Thats not part of this channel.
[11:05] <hexstatik_> lowers it
[11:06] <savagecroc> do symlinks automatically get created with chmod 777?
[11:06] <abdul> has anybody installed 12.10..............how is it? hope no hitches
[11:06] <savagecroc> o'
[11:06] <dr_willis> hexstatik_:  so the users. config/autostart is best
[11:06] <abdul> @bekks I do have  a valid juniper image just like cisco image
[11:06] <savagecroc> i've got my sudo umask and my users umask set to 0007 and they are both coming up with lrwxrwxrwx  1 root       root          26 Jan  9 20:44 2013-01-09--17-44-02.conf

[11:06] <bazhang> abdul, whats the exact question. "any hitches" is very vague
[11:06] <dr_willis> bbl. driving home..
[11:07] <thealmand> @hex try your bash,rc in /ect folder. If I understand though every new shell will reload your scrip so make sure to account
[11:07] <bekks> abdul: Then the GNS3 documentation tells you on how to use a router image.
[11:07] <abdul> i mean can u install it without any problem

[11:27] <ubottu> graydragon: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[11:28] <graydragon> once i get this fixed i can upgrade
[11:28] <MonkeyDust> graydragon  10.10 is no longer supported
[11:28] <bazhang> graydragon, its not supported here, please follow the link above to get up to speed
=== Joschi is now known as Guest29963
[11:28] <MonkeyDust> Ubuntu-erikas  no pm please
[11:28] <bazhang> graydragon, there's no fix without an upgrade
[11:28] <Ubuntu-erikas> okay
[11:29] <Ubuntu-erikas> i have an problem,when i start ubuntu 12.04 it says "Ubuntu has an internal error registred"
[11:29] <Beifong> does gnome-diskmount keep settings someplace?
[11:29] <MonkeyDust> graydragon  10.10 cannot be fixed, upgrade first
[11:30] <MonkeyDust> !find diskmount
[11:30] <ubottu> Package/file diskmount does not exist in quantal
[11:30] <graydragon> im using a live usb cant upgrade till i have access to my othe os
[11:30] <Beifong> diskmount-applet keep a reference to nautilus. I'm using precise.
[11:30] <bazhang> graydragon, then grab the latest iso and "burn" it to usb
[11:30] <graydragon> on a netbook
[11:31] <bazhang> netbooks support booting by usb no problem graydragon
[11:31] <Beifong> graydragon, grab the liveCD and use gnome-startupdisk-maker
[11:32] <bentinata> maybe this is not #ubuntu channel
[11:32] <Beifong> graydragon, but be careful with that it's dangerous.
[11:32] <bazhang> you can simply cat the iso to the usb stick

[11:32] <thealmand> @llutz I haven't bought the domain yet. not sure what a nameserver is. Perhaps you could reffer me to a good resource as I need to grow my understanding... My usual google searches are poisoned by people trying to sell me the service
[11:32] <bazhang> bentinata, whats the issue. please state it
[11:33] <bentinata> bazhang, how to PM?
[11:33] <bazhang> bentinata, /msg nickname message; good idea to ask first
[11:33] <llutz> thealmand: if you "buy" (register) an domain, the registrar will give you a webfronted to edit the nameserver-entries/to add subdomains etc.pp. those dns settings you have to adjust to your needs.
[11:34] <llutz> thealmand: since those webfrontends differ a lot from registrar to registrar, there is no general way to tell you. you could use the time to read about dns, records etc.pp
[11:34] <bentinata> a

[11:35] <bazhang> graydragon, you need to follow the eol upgrades link
[11:35] <Johnnie> What does Ubuntu use clients.l.google.com for?
[11:36] <graydragon> using a live nonpresistant usb
[11:36] <graydragon> all i have atm
[11:36] <graydragon> that and a external usb hd
[11:36] <barnex> Morning guys. I'm using ubuntu 12.10 with ecryptfs encrypted home directory. And it somehow got mounted as a read-only filesystem.
[11:37] <graydragon> witch i cant seem to install anything to
[11:37] <barnex> Can I just remount ecrypftfs as write'able like it's a normal filesystem?
[11:37] <barnex> and why did it mounted itself read-only?
[11:37] <Eagleman> My postfix will only deliver mail to local domains, not to external domains, i am looking for the option to allow sending mail to external domains, any idea how i do this?
[11:38] <barnex> Eagleman: what do you get in log when you try to send to an external domain?
[11:38] <Eagleman> relay acces denied
[11:39] <thealmand> @llutz so you could say no one ever "owns" a domain. It's closer to renting...(going out on a limb) an organization that has a big enough foot print on the web to forward a .com to an IP???
[11:39] <llutz> thealmand: basically, yes
[11:39] <thealmand> renting *from
[11:39] <barnex> Eagleman: have you tried googling it?
[11:39] <Eagleman> barnex it only allows mail to people in mydestination =
[11:41] <graydragon> eug sarry bazhang thought you were asking how there
[11:41] <barnex> bbl - reboot to test if my ecryptfs system will mount properly
[11:42] <thealmand> wow mind blown.... sounds like net neutrality as I thought it was never existed... and they still want to restrict it...
[11:45] <thealmand> @llutz if you wouldn't mind indulging me.... if instead of typing in a domain people pointed their browsers at my static ip I wouldn't need a domain or DNS?
[11:45] <llutz> thealmand: no
[11:45] <guang_> I rm /etc/apache2,then i reinstall the apache2.But now,after i run "/etc/init.d/apache2 restart",the terminal shows ".: 45: Can't open /etc/apache2/envvars"
[11:46] <jrib> guang_: because apache2 is not the package that provides those files.  Use « dpkg -S /path/to/file » to figure out the correct package
[11:46] <thealmand> @llutz ip and port lol?
[11:46] <llutz> thealmand: remembering IPs is just not as handy as having domain-names/dns, but it works (dns just translates names into IPs)
[11:46] <dibblego> if I need to upgrade 10.10 to 12.04, do I need to first upgrade to 11.04?
[11:46] <jrib> dibblego: yes
[11:46] <jrib> !upgrade | dibblego
[11:46] <ubottu> dibblego: For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[11:46] <graydragon> was using live usb to install ubuntu to an external hd it askd to be restarted i restarted and can not get windows xp sp3 to work i get a mesage...((error: no such device:ze738bad-4312-4b9b-a177-1c57b9f6171  Grub rescue>_)) windows is hybernated
[11:47] <dr_willis> graydragon:  you could reinstall and be sure to put grub on the MBR of the external USB hd. and then be sure the system is booting that HD.
[11:47] <llutz> thealmand: if your publix-IP doesn't change, its no problem to tell your friends" hey connect my webserver on "3.2.1.199:88888"
[11:47] <graydragon> so cant mount would love a step by step
[11:48] <dr_willis> if you were to mount the windoiws partion. what would you do with it?
[11:48] <llutz> well, remove 1 8
[11:48] <dr_willis> Huh? 1 8 ?
[11:48] <dr_willis> oh ;) miss read.. lol.
[11:49] <llutz> dr_willis: one of those 8s
[11:49]  * dr_willis squints
[11:49] <graydragon> atemp to save the critical info then preform surgery on it to remove grub
[11:49] <jrib> thealmand: also, at that point, you could just get a sub-domain from some place likely for free
[11:50] <graydragon> and get windows working agion
[11:50] <e9t_> JOINS
[11:50] <dr_willis> ntfs-3g has a remove hyberfile option that would let you mount the  windows drive.
[11:50] <graydragon> and atemp to do an external usb hd agion
[11:50] <graydragon> ok
[11:50] <graydragon> i havent had any luck with that
[11:51] <dr_willis> what have you done exactly with it?
[11:51] <Johnnie> I have a question. Could enybody answer me? I use WireShark and see on them that my computer use client.l.google.com. I try to use Domain Blocker and block it, but It does not work.  Do somebody know why it so and what for this domain ( client.l.google.com) is used? Maybe it is because of Firefox browser?
[11:51] <graydragon> basicly any comands to at least do a read only
[11:51] <bazhang> Johnnie, how does this relate to ubuntu
[11:52] <dr_willis> graydragon:  what commands exactly?
[11:52] <bazhang> !info wireshark
[11:52] <ubottu> wireshark (source: wireshark): network traffic analyzer - GTK+ version. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.8.2-2 (quantal), package size 889 kB, installed size 2374 kB
[11:52] <SnowmanX11> How can I cut the end of the files (e.g 5 characters) with Gnome Commender - Advance Rename Tool?
[11:52] <thealmand> ya jrib I did that through no-ip. My sucesses with that have inspired my to go farther as the free services apeared to me to have alot of entanglements. I was going to buy a domain from them but didn't like the terms of use. looked around and didn't like what I saw and I came here......
[11:52] <graydragon> i have forgoten so far was one to mount hd as read only using that 3g
[11:53] <thealmand> @llutz you say friends because there is no way I could withstand the pressure of having my ip address public
[11:53] <graydragon> i could jest be entering it rong
[11:53] <graydragon> basicly i want to back up some of the data b4 i proced
[11:53] <BluesKaj> Hiyas all
[11:54] <Eagleman> My postfix is ignoring all changes i do i main.cf, for example: mynetworks_style = host   but when i do  postconf -nf | grep mynetworks_style   mynetworks_style = subnet
[11:54] <dr_willis> sudo ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/MAKEADIRETORYFIRST -o remove_hiberfile           (i think)
[11:54] <graydragon> yea i dont wana do that till i back up first
[11:55] <dr_willis> of course there might be some data loss. its hard to tell with hiberfiles.
[11:55] <dr_willis> So... Now you want to get the windows system bootable first? or what exactly?
[11:55] <graydragon> yes thats the last step
[11:55] <dr_willis> err... that would be the first step unless you want to remove the hiberfile..
[11:56] <dr_willis> and mount the windows drive.
[11:56] <graydragon> mount drive as read only then x
[11:56] <thealmand> I know domain and dns makes things easy. But I remeber a time (in the states anyway) before cell phones when you could dial complicated numbers to get a deal on long distance phone calls. 10-10-321 just a dial a minute...
[11:56] <dr_willis> No idea if you can with a Hiberfile on the windows drive..
[11:57] <dr_willis> Not sure what removeing the hiberfile would endanger either.,. Unless you had an app OPEN that had data in it you just HAD to have...
[11:57] <graydragon> ok....so how to mount first as read only?
[11:57] <dr_willis> No idea if you can mount it read onlyt with a Hiberfile on the windows drive..
[11:57] <bekks> graydragon: You have to mount with removing the hibefile. Like being told several times.
[11:58] <thealmand> Or how about letter association with numbers dialed on a phone. **call 1-800-shopnow**
[11:59] <graydragon> ok dr willis and bekks can you please pm your step by step methods to me plz
[11:59] <graydragon> for doing the task
[12:00] <graydragon> i would be vary happy if ya did

=== francisco is now known as Guest79688
[12:03] <gineering> Ahhh
[12:03] <Johnnie> bazhang I use Linux Mint 12. Basicly it is a ubuntu. I think that if a domain blocker does not block that domain, clients.l.google.com, the reason is it is used by system or just a bug.
[12:04] <moonsandro> can anybody help me conecting ubunto to a zentyal domain????
[12:04] <MonkeyDust> Johnnie  mint is not supported here, we don't know what the mint people changed to make it 'mint'
[12:04] <thealmand> thanks for the help!
[12:04] <graydragon> one thinkg i do not know how in ubuntu
[12:05] <gineering> I have a VAIO Ns 29OJ with a Intel WiFi 550
[12:05] <dr_willis> mkdir thinkofaname
[12:05] <gorjan-stojchev> The problem is this, I'm expiriencing defunct proccesses. For example if I do tail -f I cannot kill the proccess. It gets defunct. I've did every thing posible to diagnose it. To no avail...
[12:05] <nearst> Johnnie, basic domain in /etc/resolv.conf
[12:05] <dr_willis> !mount
[12:05] <ubottu> mount is used to attach devices to directories. See also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount

[12:05] <dr_willis> ntfs-3g mounts ntfs filesystems. :)
[12:05] <gorjan-stojchev> Also this happens after a while after reboot..
[12:05] <nearst> tail -f = getting live log
[12:06] <gorjan-stojchev> I've notced this only on tail -f and on mysql. When I try to stop it it gets defunct...

[12:08] <Johnnie> MonkeyDust Mint is the same Ubuntu with own desktop.
[12:08] <graydragon> and ack the other one
[12:08] <graydragon> for your help so far
[12:09] <nearst> prostakov_alexey, u try with live cd ?
[12:09] <dr_willis> Mint has some  deep differances then ubuntu last i looked into it.
[12:09] <MonkeyDust> !mint | Johnnie
[12:09] <ubottu> Johnnie: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[12:09] <prostakov_alexey> yes. can by livecd
[12:09] <nearst> yup, same like debian and ubuntu also mint
[12:09] <prostakov_alexey> live cd is work. How cam I repaid main system?
[12:10] <dr_willis> prostakov_alexey:  is this a new install? or has it recently broken?
[12:10] <nearst> prostakov_alexey, try chroot main fs and fsck disk.
[12:10] <gorjan-stojchev> cannot kill the proccess it gets ppid to 1...
[12:11] <moonsandro> connect ubuntu to a zentyal domani? anyone??
[12:11] <dr_willis> !zentyal
[12:11] <ubottu> zentyal is a web-based GUI interface for administering a server. It is designed to work with Ubuntu/Debian style configuration management. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Zentyal (Project formally known as eBox - including in Lucid/10.04).
[12:11] <dr_willis> Im not sure how zentyal has a domain. ;) but what do i know...
[12:12] <gorjan-stojchev> also if I don't try to kill tail in time it stays active and running and it consumes 100% cpu..
[12:12] <prostakov_alexey> no, it is no new install, system live more 1 year. I can chroot for disk main system. find no errors
[12:12] <nearst> ouch. ebox. try look at /etc/resolv.conf for dns and domain related
[12:12] <gorjan-stojchev> if I kill it it gets swoped by pid 1
[12:12] <nearst> try sudo ? :)
=== nearst is now known as nearst|away
[12:13] <dr_willis>  /proc/ is a virtual/system  filesystem anyway.. so i dont think it would be a  filesystem error..
[12:14] <prostakov_alexey> ok, will try again
[12:14] <prostakov_alexey> thank you
[12:17] <Johnnie> nearst,  /etc/resolv.conf is empty. Should I write down some code?
[12:19] <gorjan-stojchev> Can anybody please direct me in which direction should I investigate further. None of the logs provide usefull info except the messages INFO: task fsnotify_mark:55 blocked for more than 120 seconds.

[12:24] <sw> Hi, I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 in Hyper-V, passwords chosen during installation but now the installation is complete and I'm at the login screen it's saying that the password is incorrect.
[12:24] <xGeek> Can i install ubuntu 12 on HP G6 ?
[12:25] <dr_willis> xGeek:  and whats a HP G6 thats so unusual?
[12:25] <riderplus> I'm trying to upgrade gdm via synaptic, I mark it for upgrade then I get "cannot upgrade package, fix broken packages first"
[12:26] <dr_willis> synaptic has a button/toggle to show broken packages.
[12:27] <sw> Hi, I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 in Hyper-V, passwords chosen during installation but now the installation is complete and I'm at the login screen it's saying that the password is incorrect.
[12:27] <riderplus> dr_willis: where's that?
[12:27] <carloItalia> salve
[12:27] <dr_willis> look around. bottom left perhaps.
[12:28] <carloItalia> hi
[12:28] <bekks> sw: Then the password is wrong. Things like caps-locvk,, shift, etc. may have occured.
[12:28] <dr_willis> sw:  try the console?
[12:28] <graydragon> ok yes id like to figure out this grub thing so i can get windos to boot agion
[12:28] <sw> bekks No, I have copy + pasted the password in during setup and again now, so they are exactly the same.
[12:30] <riderplus> dr_willis: the list of dependencies shows libaudit1 which I don't have installed and I don't know where to install it from
[12:30] <sw> So there is no solution apart from 'install again'? :-)
[12:30] <dr_willis> sw:  use a live cd, chroot in, set password
[12:31] <dr_willis> or use the recovery console mode
[12:31] <Johnnie> ! Domain blocker
[12:31] <riderplus> dr_willis: should I choose "force version??
[12:31] <riderplus> there's no libaudit1 anywhere
[12:31] <dr_willis> riderplus:  ive never needed to. Could be you have some ppa's enabled or disabled thats confuseing things
[12:31] <carloItalia> hi what is the best desktop environment?
[12:32] <dr_willis> carloItalia:  the one that you perfer...
[12:32] <dr_willis> carloItalia:  try them out.. see what you like
[12:32] <graydragon> dr willis know any thing about grub rescue?
[12:32] <xsobex787> @Geekx Okay, so I am working on a webserver which the data rention is vital, and was having issues booting, it was 10.0.4 and I am upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 but during the upgrade process (non-destructive), the upgrade failed and was getting an error indicating no init config file, i presume for grub, and its file system isn't being recognised, used boot repair disk (ubuntu-secured-remix) *LIVE
[12:32] <xsobex787> CD to attempt to address what I think are partion map errors, but am able to now have access again and the ability to mount the main HDD now, but when I restart it without the live CD, it says "Missing Operating System.    SYSLinux 4.03    Error: No Configuration File Found     No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!            boot:|
[12:32] <dr_willis> graydragon:  grub and its console/rescue modes have hunderds of pages of docs and guides. If grub breaks on me. i tend to use the boot-repair tool mentioned at the fixgrub wiki page
[12:33] <dr_willis> !fixgrub
[12:33] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows?

[12:33] <peterva> does anyone here have any luck with Citrix receiver on 12.10_amd64? I've fscking with this issue all day now, and can't seem to get it to work >_>
[12:33] <carloItalia> i use the gnome shell with cairo dock but I want to change
[12:33] <dr_willis> carloItalia:  theres  dozens of window managers and about a half dozen 'desktops' you can play with.
[12:33] <graydragon> so is there a way to tell it to uninstall its self?
[12:34] <sw> dr_willis This is in a VM, I am at the login screen now. How do I do that?

[12:35] <xsobex787> Dr Willis, i am at a Boot:|
[12:35] <xsobex787> and says im missing my OS
[12:35] <xsobex787> ive been at this for 24 hours now
[12:35] <dr_willis> !fixgrub | xsobex787
[12:35] <ubottu> xsobex787: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[12:35] <xsobex787> @Dr. Willis Okay, so I am working on a webserver which the data rention is vital, and was having issues booting, it was 10.0.4 and I am upgrading to Ubuntu 12.10 but during the upgrade process (non-destructive), the upgrade failed and was getting an error indicating no init config file, i presume for grub, and its file system isn't being recognised, used boot repair disk (ubuntu-secured-remix)
[12:35] <xsobex787> *LIVE CD to attempt to address what I think are partion map errors, but am able to now have access again and the ability to mount the main HDD now, but when I restart it without the live CD, it says "Missing Operating System.    SYSLinux 4.03    Error: No Configuration File Found     No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found!            boot:|
[12:35] <xsobex787> with the !?
[12:35] <FloodBot1> xsobex787: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[12:35] <xsobex787> sorry
[12:36] <aeon-ltd> xsobex787: you should prob pastebin that
[12:36] <xsobex787> it says boot: Could not find kernal imafe
[12:36] <xsobex787> image*
[12:36] <dr_willis> sounds like its not trying to boot the HD. or theres no bootloader on the hd.
[12:36] <xsobex787> what is paste bin
[12:36] <xsobex787> i havent used irc in like 10 years
[12:36] <dr_willis> or its for some reason trying to boot a Hd/usb/somthing that had syslinux on it at one time
[12:37] <dr_willis> a normal install does not use syslinux. the live cd does. as would a live-usb
[12:37] <graydragon> recovery menu? i like that sound
[12:37] <xsobex787> so maybe should I try pointing my drive differently in the distro on the Ubuntu Secured live CD again with boot repair disk?
[12:37] <dr_willis> graydragon:  its in the grub menu.. if you have a grub menu
[12:38] <dr_willis> xsobex787:  or have it install grub to all attatched hds. ;)
[12:38] <graydragon> ok how i get in to that , as id have to shut down
[12:38] <carloItalia> i have tested mate,kde,unity,cinnamon,xfce and lxde and I realized that xfce and lxde are not made for me unity slows me down and I see kde gnome is too complex that I'm using but I would change so that there are other desktop environments but unfortunately I do not know the names
[12:38] <xsobex787> how do I do that?
[12:38] <xsobex787> i think its a raid setup
[12:38] <dr_willis> or determins what hd you want to boot and be sure grub installs to it.
[12:38] <dr_willis> Ive no idea with raid.
[12:38] <dr_willis> I dont use raid.
[12:39] <xsobex787> it says its an LVM2 volume
[12:39] <MonkeyDust> xsobex787  ubuntu server?
[12:39] <xsobex787> im not sure what it was
[12:39] <xsobex787> i might of been
[12:39] <xsobex787> it wouldnt boot to gui to begin with
[12:39] <xsobex787> and it was sending out malware to the visitors
[12:39] <xsobex787> i have the box in meh house
[12:39] <dr_willis> carloItalia:  theres some 'window managers for x'  summary site i saw ages ago with huge lists.. but i cant reall the url
[12:39] <MonkeyDust> xsobex787  was it an installer or a live cd?
[12:40] <xsobex787> it was a live cd with the installer option
[12:40] <dr_willis> if it was sending out malware. i think using a live cd. and backing  up imporntant data... then reformating would be the best bet.
[12:40] <xsobex787> going from 10.0.4 to 12.10
[12:40] <MonkeyDust> xsobex787  ok, then it's not ubuntu server
[12:41] <xsobex787> I would like to, but it says i dont have permission
[12:41] <dr_willis> dont have permission for what?

[12:43] <bentinata> how fix that?
[12:43] <carloItalia> ok thanks

[12:44] <riderplus> dr_willis: is there any way to install libaudit1?
[12:44] <grek1>  http://wklej.to/KL59a
[12:44] <bentinata> how fix AWAY?
[12:44] <dr_willis> riderplus:  source... would be one way
[12:45] <sw> dr_willis I don't see those options when starting up. When I start the VM I see 'Hyper-V', then a purple screen for a while and then the login screen.
[12:45] <dr_willis> !find libaudit

[12:45] <riderplus> it finds libaudit0

[12:45] <riderplus> I need libaudit1 to update gdm
[12:46] <MonkeyDust> riderplus  scroll down: http://ftp.snt.utwente.nl/debian/pool/main/a/audit/
[12:46] <dr_willis> makes me wonder which gdm you are installing and if its from some unofficial ppa.
[12:47] <sw> dr_willis Thanks, I'm in the Grub menu now, do I choose the (Recovery Mode) one?
[12:47] <sw> s/Grub/GRUB

[12:47] <riderplus> thank you MonkeyDust

[12:48] <sw> ?!
[12:49] <dr_willis> Then use the recovery console feature and change it.
[12:49] <sw> dr_willis There is no 'recovery console feature' listed.
[12:49] <MonkeyDust> bentinata  no pm please
[12:49] <dr_willis> You just said you saw a GRUB menu item for 'recovery'
[12:50] <bentinata> MonkeyDust, oh okay
[12:50] <sw> dr_willis (Recovery Mode) <- Yes. Is this the 'recovery console feature' you're talking about?
[12:50] <graydragon> ok better q i think for me is how do you tell is to boot the ntfs partishion
[12:50] <bentinata> how re-enable "away" status?
[12:50] <dr_willis> it gets you to the console.. yes
[12:50] <nibbler> my system running openvas, system load is ~40. everything works smooth in cli as long as i dont try to access the process list (this is a guess) via ps, w, pkill - how would i have to change my system to be more responsive here? csw/int/io stats are basically idle.
[12:51] <sw> dr_willis So now I see 'grub> '
[12:51] <dr_willis> sounds like it dident work to me. SHould be some sort of menu its giving options for..  sounds like you went into the GRUB console/command line.

[12:57] <sw> dr_willis 'passwd: Authentication token manipulation error'
[12:58] <dr_willis> that explains why you  cant login then.

[13:01] <riderplus> dr_willis: it doesn't work
[13:01] <dr_willis> ElixirVitae:  they normally only get security updates. untill the next release
[13:01] <OerHeks> ElixirVitae, depends, some will be updated with a next version
[13:01] <dr_willis> !latest
[13:01] <ubottu> Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.

[13:02] <ElixirVitae> In that respect shouldn't I get latest firefox updates as well?
[13:02] <nibbler> dr_willis, took me ages to figure out the first time i ran into this.... but now when someone utters token manipulation errors, at least i remember :p - lets see if this is the issue here, but i know it from booting with init=/bin/bash
[13:02] <Eagleman> I am unable to figure out why i cant send mail to external domains ( relay acces denied )  http://pastebin.com/LJ95bT1W   any idea what i did wrong?
[13:02] <OerHeks> ElixirVitae, FF 18 is out, got it this morning
[13:02] <xsobex787> how do i back up data on mounted volume from root folder if it normally says access died or you do not have permission?
[13:02] <nibbler> Eagleman, you did everything right, as long as you run this on a public ip
[13:02] <Eagleman> gac relay acces denied

[13:03] <yanerwei> how to use this software?
[13:03] <gac> Eagleman: what outgoing address is on your emails? i assume it's "from: <address@eagleman.net>" ?
[13:03] <dr_willis> xsobex787:  acessing them as the root user fails?
[13:03] <ElixirVitae> I just want to know how and when they are updated.
[13:03] <xsobex787> from live cd yes
[13:03] <nibbler> Eagleman, if you would relay for unauthenticated users, it would take you about 1h to get abused by spammers and blacklisted all around the globe
[13:04] <xsobex787> im not sure how to elevate if i need too
[13:04] <yanerwei> irc
[13:04] <ElixirVitae> If it takes, say 2 weeks for repos to have newer firefox, I would switch to mozilla's own repos.
[13:04] <dr_willis> xsobex787:  use sudo as needed..
[13:04] <Eagleman> nibbler i did force logins, but i may have disabled it now, all i care for now is that it works

[13:04] <ElixirVitae> But if it is within 3 days, I would stay with the ubuntu repos, as some security vulnerabilities are seen within a few days, which is a good thing in this case.
[13:05] <dr_willis> xsobex787:  use gksudo for gui apps
[13:05] <OerHeks> ElixirVitae, this update FF18 arrived within 24 hours, not fast enought?
[13:05] <Eagleman> only emails to local domains are accepted ( @eagleman.net
[13:05] <bekks> xsobex787: In the GUI, you use gksudo instead.
[13:05] <gac> Eagleman: seems normal to me; your ISP won't relay mail from a domain that has nothing to do with them, to another domain that has nothing to do with them
[13:05] <xsobex787> interesting
[13:05] <ElixirVitae> xsobex787, > gksudo nautilus for files
[13:05] <xsobex787> i use gksudo in terminal to elevate gui?
[13:05] <MonkeyDust> ouch
[13:05] <ElixirVitae> Oh, it is more than enough OerHeks
[13:05] <Eagleman> gac, the problem is that it worked before
[13:05] <dr_willis> gksudo nautilus can  really mess you up. ;) best to learn to use the terminal to do rooty tasks
[13:05] <gac> Eagleman: your ISP may have changed some settings for security
[13:05] <Eagleman> i was using my isp as gateway
[13:05] <ElixirVitae> But what about other programs?
[13:05] <Eagleman> How can i be sure?
[13:06] <nibbler> Eagleman, if you would allow anyone to connect to your server and send emails from it, spammers would abuse it. whom to you want to accept mails from for relay?

[13:06] <gac> Eagleman: generally speaking, if I'm @domaina.com, I would never relay mail from domainb.com to domainc.com, because these two domains are both outside of my domain
[13:06] <nibbler> xsobex787, sudo cp -ax /source/path /dest/path ?
[13:06] <gac> Eagleman: as a rule of thumb, if I was running domainA.com, then either the sender or recipient would have to be @domainA.com otherwise it's nothing to do with me
[13:06] <dr_willis> ElixirVitae:  if you always want the latest of everything then a rolling release or source based disrto may be better for you.
[13:06] <ElixirVitae> But I can stay with LTS and have updates from official repos/downloads from each program.

[13:07] <t0bis> Does anyone available for a hand on Vhosts configuration for an Apache2 server ?

[13:08] <cfhowlett> ElixirVitae: LTS, backports enabled and run sudo dist-upgrade every now and then
[13:09] <ElixirVitae> I thought dist-upgrade was to go from one version to the next.
[13:09] <ElixirVitae> Is it not?
[13:09] <nibbler> Eagleman, is smtp.eagleman.net reachable from the internet ?
[13:09] <Eagleman> gac, the mail server cant mail anyways, since i am on a resident ip address, blocked by zenhaus. thats why i set up a relay_host to my isp
[13:09] <Eagleman> yes it is
[13:10] <nibbler> Eagleman, ok, was just on it. your users need to auth to use it as relay
[13:10] <bono> on 12.04 in gnome (classic): xrdb -load ~/.Xresources does what it should do; but after logging in a new gnome session it doesn't seem to load the Xresources. Any idea?

[13:10] <nibbler> Eagleman, but this is not allowed yet
[13:10] <cfhowlett> ElixirVitae: nope.  dist-release will upgrade a distro.
[13:10] <nibbler> Eagleman, yes
[13:11] <ElixirVitae> Oh.
[13:11] <slamons> installed 12.04 on an hp 8460p over the holiday but can't seem to adjust the display brightness.  any tips/pointers?
[13:11]  * ElixirVitae knows better now.
[13:11] <ElixirVitae> Thanks~
[13:11] <cfhowlett> ElixirVitae: the dist-upgrade and backports will capture new/upgraded official packages
[13:11] <dr_willis> bono:  have it auto run on login via your .config/autostart directory perhaps?
[13:11] <Eagleman> nibbler could you send what you did on telnet?
[13:11] <Eagleman> what error did you get
[13:11] <Eagleman> how do you know you have to authenticate
[13:11] <ElixirVitae> dist-upgrade is done through update manager as well, yes?

[13:12] <Eagleman> what was your RCPT TO: ?
[13:12] <nibbler> Eagleman, if you do relay for unauthenticated users, you WILL BE ABUSED AND THERFOR BLACKLISTED and unable to send any email ever again and your isp will send a hitman after you

[13:15] <nibbler> Eagleman, i gues you don't have a auth backend or whatsoever. see the difference:  http://nopaste.info/5bdd8eee53.html
[13:17] <dfgmme> anyone any app for keeping record of internet data usage
[13:17] <cfhowlett> ElixirVitae: yes through update manager or via the command line
[13:18] <llutz> !info vnstat | dfgmme
[13:18] <ubottu> dfgmme: vnstat (source: vnstat): console-based network traffic monitor. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.11-1 (quantal), package size 80 kB, installed size 308 kB
[13:19] <Eagleman> weird
[13:19] <dfgmme> ok how to i check my last login ?
[13:19] <Eagleman> ANy idea why nibbler?
[13:19] <Sling> dfgmme: /var/log/auth.log will show you system logins
[13:19] <xsobex787> root folder contents are currently unreadable
[13:19] <vmouse> permision deny
[13:20] <Pici> dfgmme: 'check' in what way?
[13:20] <magik_> Hey guys I have been having a problem with xchat causing the gui to crash causing me to have to reboot any suggestions?  This happens when I hide xchat and then bring it back up but randomly
[13:20] <xsobex787> goodnight
[13:21] <vmouse> goodnight too
[13:21] <nibbler> Eagleman, http://nopaste.info/20d0d831cd.html stuff like this might help, but this requires dovecot (or cyrus or similar) as a backend, which needs to be configured to correspond correctly with postfix... email is no trivial topic.....
[13:22] <Eagleman> nibbler i already setup dovecot as backend
[13:22] <nibbler> Eagleman, you have config lines similar to mine?
[13:24] <Eagleman> Yes nibbler
[13:24] <magik_> I'm running Ubuntu 12.10 64bit Unity - wcompiz ,  While using XChat sometimes when I hide the XChat window then bring it back causes a glitchy response flickery screen so I end up having to reboot the machine any suggestions?
[13:24] <dmi> hey all
[13:25] <dmi> I'm hoping someone can answer me a question about gparted
[13:25] <dmi> I have a 3TiB disk, which was formatted using MBR rather than GPT
[13:25] <Eagleman> nibbler:  http://pastebin.com/gkuqjX8e
[13:25] <cfhowlett> magik_: this is the xchat app?  consider dropping that in favor of the xchat plugin to firefox
[13:25] <dmi> I was planning to use gparted to move the original partition to make room for the GPT at the start of the disk
[13:26] <dfgmme> thanks gusy
[13:26] <magik_> cfhowlett, yeah I'm using the xchat app.
[13:26] <dmi> but gparted seems to allow me to use the full disk
[13:26] <dmi> my question: will it upgrade the disk to use GPT automatically?
[13:26] <cfhowlett> magik_: there is a firefox plugin.
[13:26] <Ben64> cfhowlett: whats wrong with xchat
[13:27] <cfhowlett> Ben64: magik_ reports that it futz his screen and forces a reboot
[13:27] <BluesKaj> will what upgrade ? , dmi ?
[13:27] <Ben64> i've never had an issue with xchat, having it as a plugin seems strange
[13:27] <dmi> BluesKaj: will gparted automatically upgrade the disk's MBR to GPT
[13:28] <cfhowlett> Ben64: ymmv ...
[13:28] <magik_> cfhowlett,  I don't wanna use a plugin but thanks for the info
[13:28] <dmi> so basically, the partition setup at the moment is one 2TiB partition with an MBR (msdos) partition table
[13:28] <dmi> if I ask gparted to resize the partition to fill the 3TiB disk, will it also move the partition and change the partition table to GPT format?
[13:28] <dmi> I can't seem to find any information about this one way or the other
[13:28] <nibbler> Eagleman, you are lucky, and everything is fine. just use submission port (587), this is where you already have authentication allowed, and its easier for your users to use, because less blocky ;)
[13:29] <dmi> it doesn't say it will do this when I queue up the operation (without applying it)
[13:29] <dmi> and I don't really want to destroy nearly 2TiB of data :-)
[13:29] <cfhowlett> dmi: convert mbr to gpt can be done, but gpartd won't do so automatically.
[13:29] <dmi> cfhowlett: awesome; that's exactly what I needed to know
[13:29] <nibbler> Eagleman, http://nopaste.info/383c88b77e.html - see, all auth options available
[13:29] <krywk> I need help with the Linux Steam Client.
[13:29] <Eagleman> nibbler the main idea was to disable port 25
[13:29] <senorbusybox> hello, ubuntu wasnt able to mount after restart, now I'm in the busybox, what can I do? I have no clue what to do now
[13:29] <dmi> so my plan is to move the partition up by 1MiB or so, and then convert to GPT, then resize it
[13:29] <krywk> More with Team Fortress 2.
[13:30] <cfhowlett> krywk: best to ask steam ... it's their beta product ...
[13:30] <nibbler> Eagleman, you need 25 for receiing
[13:30] <Pici> krywk: Please ask in #ubuntu-steam
[13:30] <Eagleman> recieveing in what way?
[13:30] <krywk> cfhowlett, I've already asked in the steam for Linux chat, no response.
[13:30] <Ben64> krywk: whats the problem
[13:30] <Eagleman> MTA to MTA ?
=== DavidGebler_ is now known as DavidGebler
[13:30] <krywk> It hints to opening, but nothing happens.
[13:30] <cfhowlett> krywk: again ...beta
[13:30] <BluesKaj> if you install ubuntu beside windows then grub will chainload the mbr , so to speak and include it in the menu , and of course you need to create ext4 partitons for / and /home and swap ...otherwise I don't know what you mean
[13:31] <dmi> BluesKaj: it's pure-Ubuntu; an in-office server
[13:31] <dmi> BluesKaj: but it doesn't support UEFI boot... which isn't a problem, as this 3TiB RAID is just pure data storage, not used for booting
[13:32] <dmi> BluesKaj: but I think I've got the answer I need from cfhowlett, thanks
[13:32] <Eagleman> nibbler:  25 is for MTA-to-MTA mail exchange. 587 is for user-to-MSA mail submission.   right?
[13:32] <Ben64> krywk: make sure you have graphics drivers installed and you have the requirements for tf2
[13:33] <senorbusybox> I dont know what to do, do I need to reinstall ubuntu?
[13:33] <krywk> Ben64, Graphics Drivers up to date, and I'm pretty sure I do have the requirements to run it. 4GB RAM DDR3 1333MHz, GeForce 9800GT 1GB GDDR3, Intel Core i3 @ 3.1 Ghz (2 phys-cores, 2 virtual cores)
[13:33] <krywk> So yeah.
[13:34] <raven> any way to "attach" processes that were started by cron to see theyr messages?
[13:34] <BluesKaj> oh thatEFI raises it's ugly head again ..guess I'd better do some research
[13:34] <Eagleman> raven run those processes in screen
[13:34] <Eagleman> than you can attach the screen and see what they do
[13:34] <raven> Eagleman started by cron  in background
[13:35] <Eagleman> So?
[13:35] <Eagleman> You can still add screen in the cronjob
[13:36] <raven_> any way to do it like i needed?
[13:36] <Eagleman> I dont know what you do in the cronjob
[13:37] <raven_> Eagleman, i start a tool in the cron i later want to see its messages live (not only in a textfile)
[13:37] <Eagleman> does the tool stdout ?
[13:37] <raven_> Eagleman, i think so
[13:38] <Eagleman> screen will do the job for you then
[13:38] <Eagleman> how do you write ot to a file with >
[13:38] <Eagleman> do you write it to a file like this command > file.log  ?
[13:38] <raven_> yes
[13:38] <Eagleman> you have 2 options
[13:38] <Eagleman> use tail -f on the file
[13:39] <Pici> !enter
[13:39] <ubottu> Please try to keep your questions/responses on one line. Don't use the "Enter" key as punctuation!
[13:39] <Sling> Eagleman: try it and see, echo "test" > testfile
[13:39] <Eagleman> or use screen
[13:39] <raven_> and tail -f is reloading/live?
[13:39] <Sling> oh wait
[13:39] <Sling> im misreading :)
[13:39] <Eagleman> yes it is raven
[13:39] <Ben64> krywk: run it from terminal and see what it says
[13:39] <krywk> Game update: AppID 440 "Team Fortress 2", ProcID 7491, IP 0.0.0.0:0

[13:40] <krywk> That's what it says.
[13:40] <raven_> Eagleman, oh yes thats an option! tnx
[13:40] <Eagleman> raven if the file size changes ( it happens when things get added ) tail -f will show you what changes
[13:40] <Ben64> <krywk> /bin/sh: 1: /home/krywk/.local/share/Steam/SteamApps/krywk/Team Fortress 2/hl2.sh: not found
[13:40] <Ben64> you might want to check that bit
[13:41] <krywk> Ben64, yeah, even though the file is there.
[13:41] <Ben64> well it can't find it, so theres your problem
[13:41] <Sling> you most likely need to escape the spaces with a backslash
[13:42] <krywk> hang on a sec
[13:42] <raven_> Eagleman, does >> file.txt append to the file?
[13:43] <krywk> my tf2 folder was called 'team fortress 2', steam was searching for 'Team Fortress 2'
[13:43] <Sling> raven_: yes
[13:43] <Ben64> krywk: why is it in .local anyway
[13:43] <raven_> ok
[13:43] <senorbusybox> I think I reinstall ubuntu
[13:44] <krywk> There
[13:44] <krywk> solved
[13:44] <krywk> Thanks for the help anyways c:
[13:46] <Eagleman> Can i prevent mail submission on port 25 and still accept mail exchange on port 25 in postfix?  Same for port 587 but then otherwise > 25 is for MTA-to-MTA mail exchange. 587 is for user-to-MSA mail submission.
[13:46] <senorbusybox> my ubuntu server edition wont boot anymore, what can I do?
[13:47] <Eagleman> senorbusybox boot from a livecd and go trough the logs on the filesystem
[13:48] <Mandalord> senorbusybox: did it print out anything?
[13:48] <Ubuntu-erikas> Hello
[13:48] <senorbusybox>  "Target filesystem doesn't have reqeusted /sbin/init."
[13:48] <senorbusybox> Mandalord:
[13:48] <senorbusybox> Eagleman: going to do that
[13:49] <Ben64> senorbusybox: sounds very broken
[13:49] <senorbusybox> SHIT
[13:49] <Mandalord> senorbusybox: you may want to try reinstall grub2
[13:49] <nibbler> raven, Eagleman: you can give reptyr a try, but thats a dirty hack
[13:50] <nibbler> Eagleman, when i grew up, it was port 25 only.... but i guess today you are right
[13:50] <Eagleman> nibbler there are no official ways?
[13:50] <Mandalord> senorbusybox: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1705423
[13:51] <nibbler> Eagleman, to not open port25? well - iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 25 -j DROP, but thats a hack. i'm sure there is also a nice way
[13:51] <Ben64> senorbusybox: what did you do to it
[13:51] <krz> i am dual booting. win7 for the occasional game, and linux for everything else. I've got a nvidia 680m 4gb gpu. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Bumblebee if i only want to install bumblebee for its power savings feature. is it enough just to run sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends bumblebee linux-headers-generic?
[13:51] <schnuffle> Eagleman: havent't followed, what's your problem with port 25?
[13:52] <senorbusybox> Mandalord: starting a live-cd now via usb
[13:52] <senorbusybox> thanks
[13:52] <Eagleman> schnuffle nothing, but i am trying to setup a secure box. and if i am right port 25 is only used for mail exchanged. on my machine i am able to also use port 25 for submission
[13:52] <senorbusybox> Ben64: apparently nothing, I think my harddisck is just broken
[13:53] <nibbler> Eagleman, you are fine as long as you don't open-relay, so dont worry
[13:53] <schnuffle> Eagleman: That can be changed i the postfix/exim/sendmail config, you would disbale realy on port 25 and only allow it on 587
[13:53] <Eagleman> nibbler why is my isp blocking port 25 then? for mail submission
[13:54] <Eagleman> disbale realy ?
[13:54] <nibbler> Eagleman, because he does not comply with net neutrality (and thinks you might spam if he does not watch you)
[13:54] <schnuffle> Eagleman: That could be due to load considerations
[13:55] <nibbler> schnuffle, blocking 25 for load considerations, or do i get the context wrong here?
[13:55] <schnuffle> nibbler: not blocking 25 but blocking smtp auth and relay on port 25, that's a difference and should be RFC compatible
[13:56]  * nibbler just can't see any load considerations anywhere around
[13:56] <Eagleman> should be done in master.cf under smtp right?
[13:57] <schnuffle> Eagleman: Depends on your setup, either main.cf or master.cf
[13:57] <Eagleman> i am a bit confused by my own setup..
[13:58] <schnuffle> nibbler: Imagine a heavy loaded smtp server. And now you can offload all the auth/relay checks and TLS load onto another server. Just a thought, I don't have any knowledge about the big providers
[13:58] <Eagleman> schnuffle: smtpd_relay_restrictions and the one for auth is?
[13:58] <senorbusybox> Mandalord: I'm inside my live-cd, yet my harddisks are not mounted, for some reason the link you gave me, his harddisks were already mounted
[13:59] <darryl> when an ubuntu bug is marked as 'fix committed' how long does it take the change to show up in the repo?
[13:59] <schnuffle> Eagleman: As long as you don't have any loops in your postfix ( aka pass over to amavis and the reinject to postfix) you can do it in the restriction classes
[13:59] <darryl> specifically this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-173/+bug/1064192
[13:59] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1064192 in nvidia-graphics-drivers-173 (Ubuntu Quantal) "[update request] nvidia-173.14.36 adds support for xserver ABI 13 [quantal]" [Medium,Fix committed]
[14:00] <schnuffle> Eagleman: I would place it in smptd_recipeint_restrictions.

[14:12] <thompcha> Can somebody help me troubleshoot a slow tomcat7 startup on ubuntu server 12.10?
[14:12] <schnuffle> senorbusybox: if it's in a RAID you won't see it mounted only the RAID. You can check it with mdadm --detail /dev/mdXX
[14:13] <schnuffle> where mdXX are the ones found under /dev
[14:14] <senorbusybox> schnuffle: so sda and sdc
[14:15] <senorbusybox> and I guess /dev/mapper/sil_bhadbgcdahff is the mounted version of those 2
[14:16] <schnuffle> senorbusybox: think so as well. the mdadm command gives you the infos about your raid and the integrated partitions
[14:17] <schnuffle> senorbusybox: paste the output of mount and ls -l /dev/md* to pastebin

[14:34] <Toph2> arshavin,,, yes,, that gave me the Manufacturer , but not the model of the MB
[14:34] <schnuffle> Eagleman: you should start reading some docs at postfix.org as configuring a MTA can e very risky. One way could be to allow relaying for specific IPs ( internal network for example)

[14:36] <schnuffle> senorbusybox: so the last time you mounted the disks someway, anyway what is your goal?
[14:37] <raven_> Eagleman, is there really no way to attach stdout messages by process id??
[14:37] <arshavin> Toph2: or to find motherboard model try sudo dmidecode|grep "Product Name: "
[14:38] <senorbusybox> schnuffle: yeah but, this also happened yesterday, I want to find an answer what causes this before it may be too late
[14:38] <schnuffle> raven_: you can do it in the start command and redirect the outputs e.g. command 1>/log.txt 2>&1
[14:38] <Eagleman> raven_ you were saying that stdout is written upon exit of the application
[14:39] <bekks> Eagleman: Thats wrong. stdout is writte at any time the application wants to write to it.
[14:39] <raven_> Eagleman, it writes the messages into the terminal if started manually but into file it writes only at kill
[14:40] <Eagleman> > always worked for me
[14:40] <raven_> Eagleman, yes i wonder too

[14:41] <MarKsaitis> on ubuntu?
[14:42] <MarKsaitis> if the program is called ldap-pam, it does make ALOT of sense, to keep the config file named ldap-pam.conf ????? I bet millions would agree to that, what the hell is going on!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[14:42] <MarKsaitis> !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[14:44] <Gnea> MarKsaitis: Could you please tone down the excitement?  Nobody is going to answer or take seriously a question or demand with so much punctuation.  Also, language.  Finally, not sure what your question is, it's not very clear.

[14:47] <arshavin> bekks: does that mean you dont have to have flash player installed on your system?
[14:47] <nibbler> vrnithin, does the patch exist? cat you cat /sys/class/backlight/acpi_video0/brightness ?
[14:47] <bekks> arshavin: Correct.
[14:48] <vrnithin> nibbler, i checked and the path is not exist..
[14:48] <nearst> aww
[14:48] <nibbler> vrnithin, then your hardware and/or driver does not support this in this way
[14:48] <laura_palmer> vrnithin: You shouldn't run commands on your system without understanding what they are actually doing
[14:48] <Gnea> bekks: they only started doing that in version 21
[14:48] <bekks> Gnea: Correct. :)
[14:48] <nearst> hiya
[14:49] <vrnithin> nibbler, is der any other way to set my brightness fixed ?
[14:49] <Gnea> I'm on 12.04 and my chrome is 20, so it uses the flash that I installed

[14:56] <ExxKA> Hi Guys. I have developed some server software that I will be running of ubuntu instances. I am unsure abuot what service initializer to go for, init / upstart or a third solution? These a simple servers that do not interact with other services on the machines (no hotplug) they just need to be kept alive, and go down for maintenance

[14:56] <Note_> Hello, I own a VPS with Ubuntu 12.04 and nginx running on it, I am wanting to be able to give a friend access to only a certain folder through ssh, is that possible?
[14:56] <arshavin> nearst, try adding nomodeset as kernel option during boot
[14:57] <nearst> kk.. nomodeset is very common issue.
[14:57] <ExxKA> Note_, access so that he can download and upload files?
[14:58] <schnuffle> Note_: you can use libpam-chroot to chroot some of your logins
[14:58] <Note_> ExxKA: I want to give him access to only one part of the vps which will be a folder within nginx, so that he can upload his own website, create directories for his www.domain.com/directory1/directory2
[14:58] <Note_> etc
[14:58] <vrnithin> arshavein, i can  fix it graphically..but every time i reboot its getting reset...
[14:58] <ExxKA> Note_, sounds like you need to setup an ftp server
[14:59] <Note_> Ah
[14:59] <schnuffle> Note_: If it's only for up/download use a FTP server like proftpd with sftp
[14:59] <vrnithin> arshavein, is there any way to fix it permanently  ?
[14:59] <ExxKA> Note_, if you just give him ftp access, there is no way he can get to the rest of your system as opposed to ssh where he will be able to start applications and otherwise mess about
[14:59] <Note_> Ah, FTP seems like the better option then
[14:59] <arshavin> vrnithin, i don't have bumblebee stuff so it's difficult to tell anything about the issue
[14:59] <Note_> Is there any good tutorials for what I'd need?
[15:00] <ExxKA> Note_, what schnuffle suggested will give your friend a sandbox environment using ssh
[15:00] <phax> hi guys i upgraded to Ubunto 12.0.4 and the networking manager does not start up by default bot h the wired and wireless interfaces are down...any assistance?
[15:00] <ExxKA> Note_, I am sure you can find tons of guides on the internet :)
[15:00] <Note_> I'll just use FTP, seems easier for both of us :)
[15:00] <Note_> Thank you
[15:00] <nearst> phax: try manual wired/wireless

[15:07] <arshavin> vrnithin, otherwise have a look at this bumblebee power management how to https://github.com/Bumblebee-Project/Bumblebee/wiki/Power-Management
[15:07] <abdul> even from software center...they only have version 4.1.12
[15:07] <abdul> or do i have to upgrade  my ubuntu from 12.04 to 12.10

[15:22] <linda666> hi... Im using ubuntu 12.04, i have virtual box installed. having problems with my guest OS detecting usb. no usb are available under my Devices>USB Devices menu. anyone can help how to troubleshoot that? I tried installing guest additions. the guest additions only mounts a CD icon on my guest's OS (which btw is Centos 6.3) and by double-clicking that only a folder opens.. can anyone help please??
[15:22] <pinkpelican> dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda1 bs=4KB& pid=$!
[15:22] <pinkpelican> I used this command
[15:23] <pinkpelican> It has taken 16 hours to overwrite 80GB of disk.
[15:23] <pinkpelican> Does using pid to display progress slow down the rate of process?
[15:23] <usr13> pinkpelican: Not sure about the bs designation.
[15:23] <usr13> pinkpelican: Where did you get that?
[15:24] <Slart> linda666: there used to be two versions of virtualbox, one without usb (amongst some other things) and one with it.. ubuntu repos shipped with the one without usb
[15:24] <strixbg> How to create usb live from Ubuntu 13.04 daily .iso?, I tried LinuxLive USB Creator and Universal-USB-Installer from pendrivelinux, both ways get "/boot/vmlinuz is missing" on boot from usb flash drive
[15:24] <pinkpelican> http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/1868/watch-the-progress-of-dd
[15:24] <Pici> pinkpelican: all the pid part of that does is assign the actual pid of the dd process to a shell environment variable called pid.  it has no bearing on how fast or slow that dd is running.
[15:24] <Slart> linda666: not sure what it's like at the moment though.. did you install the one from the virtualbox site or the one from the ubuntu repos?
[15:24] <schnuffle> pinkpelican: shred can do that for you
[15:24] <linda666> Slart, omg thats bad. any suggestions how i can work-around that?
[15:24] <linda666> Slart, ubuntu repo
[15:24] <pinkpelican> schnuffle can I see progress of shred?
[15:25] <schnuffle> pinkpelican: let me check
[15:25] <pinkpelican> Pici, so the rapidly changing display doesn't effect time?
[15:25] <Slart> linda666: they are both free so it's just a matter of downloading the package from virtualbox.org .. still a one-click-install iirc
[15:25] <Eagleman> schnuffle, ok and how can i be sure mail exchange will still work?

[15:27] <schnuffle> pinkpelican: for shred
[15:27] <pinkpelican> Pici, would watch -n1 "kill -USR1 $pid" slow things down less than while true; if that is what's causing the slowdown or if there is a slowdown?
[15:27] <Eagleman> WHere can i find a relay test?
[15:27] <ikonia> there are many on the net
[15:27] <ikonia> or a basic HELO/ELO test
[15:27] <pinkpelican> schnuffle, thanks for the help.
[15:28] <Pici> pinkpelican: no, that would do the same thing.   Maybe change the refresh time for watch to more than just one second, or do the same via the while true command
[15:28] <schnuffle> Eagleman: as ikonia told you you can do basic checks with a telnet session
[15:28] <Eagleman> All tested completed! No relays accepted by remote host!
[15:28] <ikonia> Eagleman: then what's the issue ?
[15:28] <pinkpelican> Pici, thank you again.
[15:28] <Eagleman> Nothing now, i guess
[15:29] <Eagleman> there will always be a new issue
[15:29] <pinkpelican> If I installed pv, would pv cause the same type of slowdown?
[15:29] <ikonia> Eagleman: then you ask about the new issue when it comes up
[15:29] <schnuffle> Eagleman: now you need to check if submission, auth and relaying is working correctly

[15:51] <boriseto> Global_Radio, well yes, but for some reason it resets on ondemand after a minute after booting. I don't know why. Try and see if it works.
[15:51] <jil> dcherniv, yes I know I don't have a fd0 so I removed it from my fstab but still
[15:52] <jil> I mean I don't have a floppy disk

[16:01] <Orpheon> Slart, if you want the exact error message: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1513397/
[16:01] <boriseto> Global_Radio, the thing is that I have different configuration and can't help you much, but as I see that it is an older nVidia graphic card and a solution is proposed there, saying that the newest version of he drivers solved their problems. Sorry I couldn't help.

[16:01] <Ladillero> Hello guys, does anyone know how to reset a bios password ?
[16:02] <Slart> Orpheon: have you looked at what is on the card using.. for example the disk utility? perhaps it's not formatted or uses some kind of weird format?
[16:02] <nearst> *sigh* grub2 is crap
[16:03] <Slart> Ladillero: remove the bios backup battery... reinsert it after a while.. there might be some kind of reset-switch as well
[16:03] <Orpheon> Slart, yes. Disk Utility shows it as a device, but trying to format it or do anything results in a helper error(1), also about no device found. Gparted doesn't even list the device
[16:03] <Ladillero> Slart it's a brand new laptop, HP Envy M6
[16:03] <Ladillero> I did try removeing the bios back up battery

What I have to do?
[16:04] <Slart> Orpheon: strange.. never had that problem myself.. let me just check if I can find something on google
[16:04] <nearst> yup. start button for your lappy
[16:05] <Ladillero> Slart I tried turning it on with no battery and it was still asking me for a password
[16:05] <Diegosnat> hi guys!!
[16:05] <Slart> Ladillero: did you remove the right battery? there might be more than one
[16:05] <lukasz_m> @Landillero  wait from 15 mins to about 4 hours after removing battery
[16:05] <Diegosnat> Can you tell me where I can find a stable repository for Samba4 for Ubuntu 12.04 ????
[16:05] <Global_Radio> boriseto, i appreciate the help nonetheless
[16:05] <Ladillero> lukasz_m Ok, I'll give it a try
[16:06] <Ladillero> Slart I did remove the visible battery
[16:06] <jhutchins_wk> Orpheon: That's a problem with the kernel drivers for the reader.  What the system sees is a new USB device which is the reader, but it does not see the actual card.
[16:06] <acovrig> I want to convert a 32bin install to a 64bit install, I have 32&64bit installs in a lvm, but can't get the 64bit to boot, it gives an exec error on initrd
[16:06] <Slart> Orpheon: is there a card in the drive? inserted the right way? working?
[16:06] <jhutchins_wk> Orpheon: Which kernel are you on?
[16:06] <Orpheon> Slart, yes, works on windows atleast.
[16:07] <Orpheon> jhutchins_wk, how do I find out?
[16:07] <Orpheon> also, fdisk -l doesn't show it
[16:07] <Orpheon> if that helps
[16:07] <nearst> sudo fdisk -l ?
[16:07] <Slart> Orpheon: then the suggestions from jhutchins_wk might be a good way to start... or I at least that's what most of the threads I found about similar errors suggested

[16:08] <Slart> Ladillero: I'm sorry.. then I'm out of suggestions.. bios passwords comes in many weird shapes and designs.. tried contacting the laptop makers support?
[16:09] <Orpheon> lukasz_m, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1513408/
[16:09] <Ladillero> Slart I will, it's HP... I'll see what do they come up with
[16:09] <Diegosnat> nearst, but i want samba 4 ! :)
[16:09] <Orpheon> lukasz_m, (the Sony thing is the SD card)
[16:09] <linda666> Slart, ok installed sucessfully -thanks for that-, and now, install guest additions still is not giving me anything
[16:09] <nearst> Diegosnat, u may google for that.
[16:10] <laura_palmer> Diegosnat: Use a rolling release distribution
[16:10] <Diegosnat> nearst, did no success
[16:10] <laura_palmer> Diegosnat: Or you can always compile it yourself, it's not difficult
[16:10] <lukasz_m> @Orpheon does it work on other OS? maybe card is faultly?
[16:10] <Diegosnat> laura_palmer, what's that?
[16:10] <Slart> linda666: great.. now download the Extension pack.. it's available from the same page where you downloaded the virtualbox package
[16:10] <Orpheon> lukasz_m, yes, it works on windows
[16:10] <Orpheon> (7)
[16:10] <linda666> Slart, oh okie
[16:11] <laura_palmer> Diegosnat: Rolling release is a version of Linux where software is continually updated, rather than Ubuntu where you are given specific "stable" (old) versions
[16:11] <lukasz_m> @Orpheon try sudo dd if=/dev/sdb of=/dev/zero count=16
[16:11] <Orpheon> dd: opening `/dev/sdb': No medium found
[16:11] <Diegosnat> laura_palmer, unfortunately im forced to use ubuntu 12.04 so I need to find a solution for that specific distro
[16:11] <nearst> sda?
[16:12] <lukasz_m> @Orpheon   sorry, no idea. Is this the same when you insert reader to USB WITH your sd card?
[16:12] <laura_palmer> Diegosnat: Then compiling it yourself is the best option
[16:12] <Orpheon> lukasz_m, you mean without?
[16:12] <Diegosnat> but when they roll out an update, how can I do it?
[16:12] <f00l> i am strucking with my libc6 update in bt someone pls guide me
[16:13] <Rootbrian> diegosnat: I'm also forced to use 12.04 on my desktop due to better compatibility.
[16:13] <Diegosnat> also my boss would be happy with that solution
[16:13] <lukasz_m> @Orpheon   insert  card into reader, and then insert reader to usb
[16:13] <Orpheon> lukasz_m, no, no sdb gets created
[16:13] <Orpheon> lukasz_m, yes, that's what I did before
[16:13] <Diegosnat> Rootbrian, have u managed to install samba4?
[16:13] <nearst> check on dmesg
[16:13] <kelvinella> hi is elementary OS ubuntu with different DE?
[16:13] <Rootbrian> Diegosnat: no, I don't use samba or servers.
[16:14] <lukasz_m> @rootbrian  you just have to compile samba4 every time after update. Sorry, but it is not in official repos
[16:14] <jackherer1> Hello, have anyone tried bodhi linux?
[16:14] <MonkeyDust> jackherer1  #bodhilinux
[16:14] <nearst> Diegosnat, samba4 in repo
[16:14] <lukasz_m> @Orpheon maybe support is missing in drivers.. I have no idea what to do
[16:14] <Diegosnat> nearst, yes but there is a buggy version
[16:15] <laura_palmer> kelvinella: It's based on Ubuntu, but more software is changed they just the DE
[16:15] <Rootbrian> kelvinella: you can install another window manager or desktop environment with sudo apt-get install <window-manager-name>
[16:15] <jackherer1> thx monkey

[16:16] <kelvinella> is elementary OS lighter than xubuntu??
[16:16] <laura_palmer> kelvinella: No
[16:16] <ikonia> kelvinella: try it, lighter is a very subjective phrase
[16:16] <kelvinella> i saw a youtube video, it is fast and slick
[16:16] <ikonia> kelvinella: a video is not a sane test
[16:17] <kelvinella> and the dock at the bottom seem more usable than the xbuntu dock
[16:17] <ikonia> kelvinella: then use it
[16:17] <nearst> yup. lol
[16:17] <Rootbrian> I'm hoping team canonical/ubuntu avoids packaging a buggy, rushed or unstable version of Cheese in the next feature and LTS version. I hate using gtk-recordmydesktop and cheese from a PPA to even capture video. :(
[16:17] <laura_palmer> kelvinella: Xubuntu doesn't have a dock, it has a panel. And it's very configurable and stable
[16:17] <kelvinella> but i already installed xubuntu, i dont wanna reinstall everthing again
[16:18] <ikonia> kelvinella: then it won't be "lighter" as it's ubuntu
[16:18] <kelvinella> i find that the dock or the unity is better when i open like 20 different window
[16:18] <Rootbrian> kelvinella: stick with xubuntu then. But note that bluetooth internet tethering doesn't work.
[16:18] <kelvinella> in xubuntu although it is light weight but when i have many stuffs open, its hard to see which is which
[16:18] <xangua> Rootbrian: why would not¿
[16:18] <mogensendannie> Hello, can anybody Help me out on an issue about an Errormessage in Ubunto server 10.04.3

[16:20] <laura_palmer> kelvinella: Right click and look at the settings
[16:20] <ikonia> what is hyperfilesql server ?
[16:20] <mogensendannie> Hyperfile server is a databaseprogram working with Ubuntu
[16:20] <Slart> is there a gui to manage groups in ubuntu these days? didn't there use to be one?
[16:21] <Rootbrian> xangua: whoops, I didn't read correctly. Well, the bluetooth functions on xubuntu are different and haven't worked in a long time. Couldn't tether my blackberry. People couldn't tether their androids either (using bluetooth application or native)
[16:21] <ikonia> mogensendannie: so have you tried starting it ?
[16:21] <ikonia> Slart: the old user gui could do groups too
[16:21] <mogensendannie> but the Errormessage number, do you have any Idea what kind of Error, Right?
[16:21] <mogensendannie> Yes I tried starting it, and it only gives this error

[16:23] <ikonia> datruth: plus your also telling lies as you've only just asked

[16:30] <_Ethan_> best regards
[16:30] <MonkeyDust> datruth  if you get answers in pm and the person leaves hies desk, you're left behind without help
[16:30] <Rootbrian> _Ethan_: you can do that with the live CD.

[16:30] <vitalyi> hey people do anyone use that UNITY?
[16:30] <ikonia> wooo: use the illumos website to get info - it's not ubuntu
[16:31] <Rootbrian> wooo: best to visit that distro's website and find out more.
[16:31] <ikonia> vitalyi: most ubuntu users will use unity
[16:31] <_Ethan_> Rootbrian that is what i dont want to do
[16:31] <Rootbrian> vitalyi: I use gnome-panel within fluxbox.

[16:32] <Rootbrian> _Ethan_: backup the /home/ folder to a usb or second hard drive (not partition as second hard drive), then go about the usual reinstallation, then use the live CD to restore the /home/ folder.
[16:32] <vitalyi> gnome2 or kde does not have that problem
[16:33] <vitalyi> it sounds strange so far, jhutchins_wk, but it happens

[16:33] <Rootbrian> vitalyi: un/plug the network cable then? Or toggle wifi via the physical function?

[16:34] <xangua> (10:34:29) _Ethan_: with the repositories, maybe i have to change them... - very bad idea
=== updates is now known as oscailt
[16:35] <arabi> http://pastie.org/5655654   <<< I have to empty the list .. how can I do that
[16:35] <_Ethan_> so it seems there is no solution to my question xangua
[16:36] <Rootbrian> _Ethan_: nope, there isn't. You have to go about the Live CD/USB method instead like I always do.
[16:36] <vitalyi> it simply crashes (graphics looks like when compiz fails) - unable to see mouse or cursor, no response for any action
[16:36] <vitalyi> the only think i can do is to shut the computer down by pressing power button
[16:37] <nearst> u may use ctrl + alt + L1 to login to console
[16:37] <KeyboardNotFound> How to delete chat history of skype ?
[16:37] <_Ethan_> Rootbrian okkk

[16:38] <ZenMasta> How can I type a command and have the output pause before it fills up another screen.
[16:38] <lombardo> windows will have my laptop battery stop charging when i use it in "desktop mode".. this makes the batery live longer..  how do i get the same thing in ubuntu?
[16:40] <jhutchins_wk> Is there some reason you can't just take 11.04 to 11.10 then to 12.04 then 12.10?
[16:41] <_Ethan_> jhutchins_wk yes, i try to update to 11.10 but i get an error
[16:41] <jhutchins_wk> _Ethan_: So fix the error.
[16:41] <k1l> _Ethan_: which error?
[16:42] <meLon> Is it possible to have python-pyopencl in Ubuntu 12.04 without nvidia-current?  I'm having a hell of a time getting this working :\
[16:42] <MrPopinjay> Hey
[16:42] <Slart> ZenMasta: I don't think you can actually pause the program doing the printing but you can use more, less or most to buffer the output so you can browse around in it at your leisure
[16:42] <Slart> ZenMasta: ls | more   will give you a kind of text editor view of the output where you can scroll up and down, search and so on
[16:43] <Slart> ZenMasta: personally I prefer "most" but you'll have to install it first..   sudo apt-get install most
[16:43] <jhutchins_wk> ZenMasta: You can pipe the output to more or to less.
[16:43] <jhutchins_wk> ZenMasta: It's possible to pause some output with the pause or scroll lock keys, but that's a little harder at the speeds we get today.
[16:44] <ZenMasta> I was hoping to pause this for example dpkg --get-selections
[16:44] <jhutchins_wk> ZenMasta: It's possible to scroll back with shift-page up, but the buffer is limited.
[16:44] <jhutchins_wk> zen dpkg --get-selections
[16:44] <jhutchins_wk> zen dpkg --get-selections | less
[16:45] <jhutchins_wk> (stupid keyboard)
[16:45] <MrPopinjay> Anyone else failing to download all the repository indexes on 12.04?
[16:45] <ZenMasta> jhutchins_wk thanks
[16:45] <jhutchins_wk> ZenMasta: you might want to look for articles on "bash redirect" for the many wonderful ways you can use that.
[16:46] <ZenMasta> I guess I could have wrote to text file too, but that's exactly what I wanted
[16:48] <_Ethan_> k1l
[16:48] <_Ethan_> i have 10.10 and it seems it cannot find some files in the server

[16:50] <timotej> Hi i moved to ubuntu 12.10 from Fedora and I had multiple problems but i was able to fix them except for one
[16:51] <Slart> _Ethan_: if you're looking for some repository files there used to an url for the old repos.. something with old-releases in it.. it's probably in that link from ubotty
[16:51] <Slart> _Ethan_: that might help you to at least get the upgrade to a new version going
[16:51] <k1l> Slart: yep, its in the wiki page for EOL UPgrades
[16:51] <timotej> my parition layout is sda2 /boot sda3 / and in LVM on sdb /home and /var (sda is SSD sdb is HDD) and home stayed from fedora
[16:51] <arabi> http://pastie.org/5655744     <<< i am getting an error here please help

[16:52] <timotej> i have to write vgscan and vgchange -ay combo
[16:52] <_Ethan_> pfff
[16:52] <_Ethan_> just wanna update ubuntu
[16:52] <timotej> so LVM paritions are recognized and system continues to boot
[16:52] <jhutchins_wk> So what's the policy on when old releases get move to the old-releases repositories?
[16:52] <timotej> any ideas why ubuntu has problems with this? and how to somehow make it boot automatically
[16:53] <k1l> _Ethan_: did you read and understand how an EOLUpgrade works, now?
[16:53] <_Ethan_> no, actually i dont know how it works
[16:53] <_Ethan_> the "ubuntu pc" is 10 meters from me
[16:53] <k1l> jhutchins_wk: its: gets no support its just a historical repo that apt-get and upgrades still work
[16:53] <_Ethan_> gonna look at that
[16:54] <k1l> _Ethan_: read the link the bot gave you and do whats is written there
[16:54] <_Ethan_> is it maybe possible to update from the command-line ?
[16:54] <k1l> _Ethan_: read that link. its explained in there
[16:54] <_Ethan_> which link?
[16:54] <jhutchins_wk> k1l: I understand that, I'm just wondering when releases get moved there.  Are only the two most recent on the active repos?  Only the most recent three?
[16:54] <k1l> !EOL | _Ethan_

[16:54] <k1l> _Ethan_: ^ that link
[16:54] <_Ethan_> oh ok
[16:55] <_Ethan_> im sorry
[16:55] <k1l> jhutchins_wk: they get moved after X monthes after EOL
[16:55] <jhutchins_wk> _Ethan_: Basically the older releases get moved to an archive server.
[16:55] <_Ethan_> gonna look at that then
[16:55] <k1l> jhutchins_wk: let him read it. its explained there. i think he just gets confused now
[16:56] <jhutchins_wk> k1l: So how does _Ethan_ determine which releases are on old-release and which are on the regular mirrors?
[16:57] <k1l> jhutchins_wk: i dont get your point. he has to do it for the first upgrade at least. since 10.10 is put of support "some" time
[16:57] <c00kee> anyone install ubuntu on acer's google chromebook
[16:57] <jhutchins_wk> k1l: Understood - but what's the oldest release that's still on the main servers?
[16:57] <MonkeyDust> c00kee  guess this is not the right place to ask
[16:58] <morfeo> hello, someone can help me to format a usb, this have virus and mkfs.vfat dont work
[16:58] <_Ethan_> arf, that links is not enough
[16:58] <c00kee> know of any room that can help with that monkey dust
[16:58] <_Ethan_> actually it seems Help widget says i have 11.10
[16:58] <_Ethan_> but in the command line i get maverick
[16:58] <_Ethan_> (10.10)
[16:58] <_Ethan_> so it seems synaptic made some crap when trying to update
[16:59] <OerHeks> c00kee, is it an ARM chromebook ?
[16:59] <k1l> _Ethan_: you have to change the repos to a old-releases repo. that is the point. i dont know why you are not doing it
[16:59] <k1l> jhutchins_wk: see the header: http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/
[17:00] <jhutchins_wk> c00kee: Not too many people have tried yet.  There are some very strange looking schemes to get it working, but I don't know of anybody who's done a direct install.
[17:00] <jhutchins_wk> c00kee: If you want a minimalist ubuntu netbook there are probably better options like an Acer One.
[17:00] <_Ethan_> k1l that link does not include 10.10 version
[17:00] <jhutchins_wk> k1l: D'Oh!
[17:01] <Pici> _Ethan_: yes it does. look again
[17:01] <c00kee> i have installed and currently  running uuntu 12.04 on my acer chromebook
[17:01] <blim> what would make a mouse wheel become intermittent?
[17:02] <c00kee> i just wan to rub elbows with someone on working on develpments
=== bono is now known as bono_
[17:02] <_Ethan_> anyways i think there should be a standard way to simply update from "almost every version"
[17:02] <c00kee> arm type processor
[17:02] <MonkeyDust> c00kee  #ubuntu-app-devel
[17:03] <c00kee> ok
[17:03] <_Ethan_> of course im no-one to ask that, this is free software
[17:03] <OerHeks> c00kee, you might want to check out #ubuntu-arm for that
[17:03] <jhutchins_wk> c00kee: Was it just a normal install or did you have to do some unusual steps?
[17:04] <blim> what would make a mouse wheel become intermittent?
[17:04] <SonikkuAmerica> Ah, this looks better
[17:04] <c00kee> yeah toplace it in developer mode which is done by going into the bios
[17:04] <k1l> _Ethan_: sry, but you are more than overdue. that is your fault. so you have to do the "work" of changing 3 words.
[17:04] <orudie> any reason why ubuntu desktop image iso does not fit on a regular 700 mb CD ?
[17:04] <c00kee> and then using the command prompt and installing directly from there
=== bono_ is now known as bono
[17:05] <_Ethan_> not only that, im sure there will be more problems, as always k1l
[17:05] <jhutchins_wk> c00kee: If you could do a writeup of the process and put it somewhere on the wiki it would be very useful.
[17:05] <_Ethan_> but yes, it is my fault
[17:05] <SonikkuAmerica> orudie: It has ~1 GB of data...?
[17:05] <_Ethan_> however, 10.10 is a 2011 version , that is not too much time
[17:05] <_Ethan_> inmho
[17:05] <jhutchins_wk> c00kee: If you followed a good writeup, could you post the link here?
[17:05] <k1l> _Ethan_: you could easily be upgrading already if you would read what its meant you to do and do it instead of talking about it or other things all the time
[17:06] <Pici> _Ethan_: 10.10 was released in 2010.  The Ubuntu version numbers represent the YEAR.MONTH of release.
[17:06] <te> orudie: What is the name of the file you downloaded?
[17:06] <k1l> _Ethan_: wrong on that, too. 10.10 came on 10. month on 2010.
[17:06] <SonikkuAmerica> Pici, _Ethan_, k1l: Not to mention it's outdated.
[17:06] <c00kee> well i saw it on the a forum  at http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/12/how-to-install-ubuntu-on-acers-199-c7-chromebook/
[17:06] <jhutchins_wk> c00kee: Thank you.
[17:06] <k1l> _Ethan_: and there are LTS releases for people who dont want to upgrade that often. so dont blame us on that :/

[17:09] <k1l> _Ethan_: and to upgrade fomr 10.10 to 11.04 to 11.10 (which support ends next time) and preferable to 12.04 (LTS) is way more work and time than to install a new release direct

[17:13] <MonkeyDust> Allspark  and you need a tool to do it?
[17:13] <Allspark> I don't know. I've tried many things.
[17:14] <SonikkuAmerica> Allspark, jhutchins_wk: I think Ubuntu's Web site has a page devoted to that

[17:15] <blim> every*
[17:15] <Allspark> thoonai, i did dd. It installed properly, but it won't boot up. Using rEFIt yieled the 'Missing Operating System' error
[17:15] <DexterF> SonikkuAmerica: yes, UDF based. nother story. well, brasero actually *can* backup DVD to image files, but it gives me tons of errors that don't mean nothign. guess I'm missing deps.
[17:15] <jhutchins_wk> blim: What do the times when the scroll doesn't work have in common?
[17:15] <DexterF> nautilus, eh? gonna check that...
[17:15] <jhutchins_wk> blim: That probably has nothing to do with USB.
[17:16] <blim> it just seems random but maybe if I dont use it for a while it might happen.

[17:31] <Allspark> te: i already saw that. didn't work. i booted up and it said 'missing operating system'
[17:31] <jrib> Laurenceb: how did you get to it?
[17:31] <Laurenceb> system-printers
[17:31] <Laurenceb> added a new printer, set it up as lpd://uiwapeps03
[17:31] <MonkeyDust> Allspark  have you asked in the mac channel?
[17:32] <Laurenceb> then set up the drivers for the correct model
[17:32] <Allspark> no what is the mac channel?
[17:32] <Laurenceb> smb:uiwapeps03 also fails
[17:32] <Laurenceb> smb:// even
[17:32] <te> Allspark: Run md5sum on the ISO image and google it.  (Verify that the image is authentic.)
[17:33] <MonkeyDust> Allspark  #MacOSX
[17:33] <Allspark> te: lol what is the md5sum
[17:33] <te> Allspark: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum
[17:34] <blizzow1> I think I found a minor bug/inconvenience for the motion package.  The motion process runs as user motion, but the default directory the conf file saves to does not have permissions set correctly for the motion user to write to it.  The motion process dies when it tries to write to a location it does not have permission to write to.   Can anyone else verify?
[17:34] <Allspark> macosx channel is dead
[17:35] <ejv> thats because it just works

[17:35] <ubottu> Laurenceb: As you can see, this is a large channel. If you're speaking to someone in particular, please put their nickname in what you say (use !tab), or else messages get lost and it becomes confusing :)
[17:36] <te> Allspark: If the iso image is authentic, verify that the process you used to write the image to the USB stick is correct/proper.
[17:36] <Allspark> well im' using that link that you sent me te.
[17:36] <jrib> Laurenceb: I usually prefer the cups web interface.  But you should be able to do the same through the gui. Do you not see the printer listed as a network printer?
[17:36] <Allspark> jrib: you need to type /whois [username] for that to work
[17:37] <te> Allspark: Run md5sum against the iso image and see what you get.
[17:37] <Allspark> te: i'm on mac, i can't
[17:37] <ejv> Allspark: !who is a command supported by the robot "ubottu"
[17:38] <Laurenceb> jrib: no
[17:38] <Laurenceb> its not a printer
[17:38] <Laurenceb> its a printing service

[17:38] <Laurenceb> shared between all printers on the network via a print server
[17:38] <Allspark> oh
[17:39] <ejv> Allspark: you have to use the pipe operator: | e.g. !who | nick
[17:39] <jrib> Laurenceb: my guess is it works the same, no?
[17:39] <te> Allspark: I'm sorry for the limitations of MacOS.  Are you sure there is not an md5sum app that can be installed?
[17:39] <Laurenceb> well maybe
[17:39] <Laurenceb> but its not working
[17:39] <Allspark> te i'll look for something.

[17:40] <Geet> is it possible  as a last ditch effort to replenish my 8 year old desktop. pentium iv 1.8ghz and 512 mb ram?  which distro may work?
[17:41] <atlef> Geet, xubuntu maybe
[17:41] <Laurenceb> bbl
[17:41] <shomon> Geet: lubuntu maybe, or puppylinux if all else fails
[17:41] <MonkeyDust> Geet  i've used a 10 year old desktop with linux
[17:41] <jrib> Geet: lubuntu should work great
[17:41] <MonkeyDust> Geet  it was debian
[17:41] <dniMretsaM> Geet: Lubuntu, CrunchBang, SliTaz, or Puppy
[17:41] <hsnmck> hello, is there a way to use the wireless card to connect to the internet and to create a hotspot at the same time?
[17:41] <Geet> MonkeyDust: which one? was the usage normal or slow?
[17:42] <Geet> jrib: the latest version would work?
[17:42] <jrib> Geet: yep
[17:42] <te> hsnmck: You need a router.
[17:42] <shomon> hsnmck: doubt it.. and if it does, I want one
[17:43] <Geet> dnimretsam: slitaz and puppy are to minimal i tried them.. never heard the others.. would i find old drivers?
[17:43] <shomon> what do you do if your work email is outlook based and you're in ubuntu?
[17:43] <shomon> apart from suicide suggestions :)
[17:43] <Geet> jrib: would i find the required drivers?
[17:43] <jrib> Geet: drivers for what?
[17:44] <te> hsnmck: You can share the connection with the LAN port into which you plug a wireless router that can act as your "hotspot"
[17:44] <dniMretsaM> Geet: Lubuntu is Ubuntu with the LXDE desktop. CrunchBang is Debian-based and usus OpenBox. in my opinion, it's the best OpenBox distro around
[17:44] <dniMretsaM> s/usus/uses/
[17:44] <Geet> jrib: sound printer
[17:44] <atlef> shomon, http://askubuntu.com/questions/24083/recommend-an-outlook-replacement
[17:44] <jrib> Geet: try and see :)  I doubt you need to do anything special with such an old machine
[17:45] <nearst> bodhi , antiX also good. im not eyecandy guy :)
[17:45] <dniMretsaM> nearst: I'd suggest Ubuntu Minimal wih XMonad, but...
[17:45] <shomon> atlef: yeah if possible I'd connect via clawsmail
[17:45] <dniMretsaM> if Puppy is too minimal for him, he'd die trying to use XMonad
[17:46] <shomon> but I can't get them to change their email server or windows-centricness.. until they grow enough to be required by law to form a union or something
[17:46] <Geet> jrib: so i will try lubuntu. what's the latest?
[17:46] <nearst> worth to try , and find suitable . ima use remastersys to backup as iso and install it back make my own custom
[17:46] <dniMretsaM> or he could just do Ubuntu Minimal with GNU Screen. that'd be interesting
[17:47] <jrib> Geet: 12.10 is the latest release; 12.04 is the latest LTS release
[17:47] <dniMretsaM> Geet: Lubuntu 12.10 is the latest stable. Or you could go with 12.04, which is the latest LTS release
[17:47] <nearst> ubuntu minimal + emacs binds. lol
[17:47] <ClientAlive> Hi, I'm trying to do something real quick. I'm trying to remember how to use wildcards to make numbered directories (multiple directories in one comand). I tried "mkdir Assignment[1-9]" and "mkdir Assignment*[1-9]" but in both cases it just made a single diretory with exactly that as it's name? Anyone can tell me the command for this?
[17:48]  * dniMretsaM loves him some Emacs, nearst
[17:48] <jrib> ClientAlive: echo {1..9}
[17:48] <Geet> jrib, dnimretsam which one would work better? i mean stable and fast etc
[17:48] <kriskropd> ClientAlive: thats because you put it in quotes, remove the quotes
[17:48] <ClientAlive> jrib: ahhh... the ol' squiggly brackets
[17:49] <zakkotron> i have installed glib atk latest version in /opt directory so how to configure gtk to these new libraries before installing it
[17:49] <dniMretsaM> they're both about the same, probably. 12.10 has some newer software, so you might get speed improvements.
[17:49] <Geet> jrib: how about peppermint?
[17:49] <ClientAlive> kriskropd: I didn't put quotes in the command I only put them here to set of the [code] ... [/code]
[17:49] <jrib> Geet: well with 12.04 you'll have support for 5 years.  So if you want to stick something on there and not worry about upgrading for a few years, go with 12.04.  12.10 has support for only 18 months, but it is more recent
[17:50] <jrib> Geet: I don't know what peppermint is
[17:50] <savid> Why do I now get "Directory not empty", when I type "rm -rf somedir/", and then running the *exact* command a second time works?
[17:50] <ClientAlive> jrib: thx. worked  :)
[17:50] <ejv> a p4 with 512mb of ram running 12.04 lts, that sounds like a bad idea. 12.04 is a dog.
[17:50] <jrib> savid: pastebin full input and output preceded by "ls -R somedir"
[17:51] <jrib> ejv: he's using lubuntu
[17:51] <savid> jrib, well the directory is gone now... but, why would it matter what's in the directory?
[17:52] <ejv> not sure that changes how i feel... heh
[17:52] <Geet> jrib: i don't think that system will work for more than a year :D so i will opt for 12.10 then..
[17:52] <TheBronx> Hi all
[17:52] <Geet> does it have a software center like ubuntu?
[17:52] <auronandace> Geet: peppermint isn't supported here
[17:52] <savid> Oh...  wait, the directory is not gone
[17:53] <savid> so, rm -rf didn't remove the whole dir
[17:53] <jrib> Geet: yep, it's the same distribution.  It just has a different set of default applications
[17:53] <atlef> Geet, that is what is great about most distro's, they run live from dvd/usb/cd, so you can try before you install
[17:53] <jrib> savid: to explain what happened we need more information; that's why I asked
[17:54] <TheBronx> I have ubuntu server 10 and I would like to know what does this message means: "r8169: eth0: link up"
[17:54] <Geet> atlef: i got some shitty internet speeds here :( so downloading the iso is a pain.. anyways.. i will try some as u suggested..
[17:54] <nearst> agree.. :)
[17:54] <jrib> savid: if you want me to make a guess... it's some permission issue
[17:54] <Geet> thanks jrib
[17:54] <atlef> Geet, ok
[17:54] <nearst> Geet, what u looking for atm?
[17:55] <savid> jrib, http://sprunge.us/VRQN
[17:55] <zakkotron> i have installed glib atk latest version in /opt directory so how to configure gtk to these new libraries before installing it
[17:55] <strangr> zakkotron, also specify the version
[17:56] <savid> jrib, and here's the output if ls -lR to show permissions:  http://sprunge.us/TMXe
[17:56] <jrib> savid: I should have said: ls -lR google-chrome
[17:56] <jrib> :)
[17:56] <savid> This may have something to do with the profile problems I'm having with chrome :-P
[17:56] <savid> What, other than permissions, would make a file non-deletable?
[17:57] <TheBronx> anyone? r8169: eth0: link up?
[17:57] <jrib> savid: that's kind of weird.  Can you use rm on Custom.css?
[17:57] <klpkt> Hello, I have a question; Is it possible to mount a CD drive?
[17:57] <nearst> ownership
[17:57] <jrib> savid: I'm assuming your user is "ben"
[17:57] <savid> jrib, correct
[17:57] <ejv> TheBronx: looks like a signal sent to your kernel ring buffer indicating your interface is active
[17:57] <zakkotron> i have installed glib 2.34.3 atk 2.6 in /opt directory so how to configure gtk 3.6.4 to these new libraries before installing it. i m using ubuntu 12.04
[17:57] <MonkeyDust> klpkt what goes wrong when you just enter the cd?
[17:57] <auronandace> klpkt: technically you mount what is inserted into the drive
[17:57] <Slart> klpkt: I think you can mount a cd disc.. the drive itself might not be mountable
[17:58] <jrib> zakkotron: can I ask why you are doing this?
[17:58] <zakkotron> i have installed glib 2.34.3 atk 2.6 in /opt directory so how to configure gtk 3.6.4 to these new libraries before installing it because it is still getting glib 2.32.3. i m using ubuntu 12.04
[17:58] <savid> Oh, duh. Probably b/c chrome is still running :-/
[17:59] <jrib> savid: that shouldn't matter
[17:59] <remontees> Hello ¡!
[17:59] <te> savid: You can only delete files or directories that are owned by your username.
[17:59] <savid> jrib, I just killed chrome and was able to delete the directory
[17:59] <klpkt> When I enter the CD, which is an installation CD, it opens the contents in Rhytmbox, but nothing else happens.
[17:59] <savid> te, they are owned by my username.
[18:00] <nep1x> the 32 bit version of a distro works good in a 64-bit architecture? or should I download the 64-bit version? which advantages/disadvantages could have one against the other? thanks
[18:00] <jrib> savid: maybe chrome recreates that file...?
[18:00] <Getterac7> nep1x: 32-bit will work fine, but you're limited to 4GB of RAM or so.
[18:00] <atlef> klpkt, what did you want to happen?
[18:01] <jrib> nep1x: nowadays, if your hardware supports 64bit I would advise using 64bit
[18:01] <te> nep1x: Yes, the 32bit verson will be fine.
[18:01] <strangr> jrib, that issue zakkotron is having any ideas?
[18:01] <klpkt> I did have a problem earlier with not being able to open /media/[username], and now when I try to open the CD contents in nautilus, it says that /media/[username]/[cdname] isn't a folder.
[18:01] <savid> jrib, dunno. but killing the process allows me to remove it. strange.
[18:01] <ejv> you can use a 32bit kernel with PAE to address memory outside the ~4GB range
[18:01] <jrib> savid: you can test if you want, make a copy of some mp3, play the mp3, and delete the mp3 while it's playing
[18:02] <nep1x> ok, thanks guys.
[18:02] <jrib> strangr: yes, I'm wondering why he wants to do that :)
[18:02] <klpkt> atlef: I wanted to be able to open the contents in i.e. nautilus, and to open it in PlayOnLinux, to install The Sims 3.
[18:03] <atlef> klpkt, ok, not sure what is going on, sorry
[18:03] <TheBronx> is it normal to have thousands of messages like "r8169: eth0: link up" during a SYN flood attack?

[18:06] <Third3ye> So there's no sound coming from the HDMI output
[18:06] <Third3ye> I want to fix this...
[18:06] <klpkt> te: No, it's an installation CD for the Sims 3, but Ubuntu/Rhythmbox seems to think it is.
[18:06] <strangr> the latest git requires that verison of gtk
[18:06] <strangr> and glib
[18:06] <strangr> but 12.04 ships with the older ones..
[18:06] <strangr> jrib ^

[18:09] <Third3ye> ALSA recognises the speaker output and HDMI output, but only the speakers on the laptop seem to work
[18:09] <jrib> strangr: maybe check out jhbuild.  Should make the process easier for you
[18:09] <nep1x> sorry guys, I know this is not the right place to ask this question, but I know you can anwer it in a light quickly way... Its my understanding that amd is the competitor of intel and when downloading the 64-bit version the file name ends in amd64. But my cpu is intel... Can you understand my confussion.¡? jejeje thanks
[18:09] <udi_10x_org_il> Hi! Anybody remembers what was the name of the service allowing to setup an intermediate ssh relay?
[18:09] <strangr> jrib he already uses jhbuild
[18:09] <strangr> jrib however i dont
[18:10] <strangr> jrib but he seems to have the same issue
[18:10] <strangr> with jhbuild too
=== torminator is now known as Guest69611
[18:11] <Getterac7> nep1x: amd64 just means 64-bit... if you have a recent Intel CPU, it will work fine.
[18:11] <jrib> strangr: you can usually pass arguments to ./configure indicating where various libraries can be found.  But jhbuild should automate all of this
[18:11] <Getterac7> amd64 refers to the CPU instruction set that supports 64-bit.
[18:11] <TheBronx> is it normal to have thousands of messages like "r8169: eth0: link up" during a SYN flood attack?

[18:52] <m60> Anyone know if there Firefox 17 ESR will be added to Ubuntu repositories?
[18:53] <MonkeyDust> m60  the current  version is 18
[18:53] <m60> Firefox ESR: "Extended Support Release", MonkeyDust , it's the equivalent of LTS.
[18:56] <MisterL> maybe you guys can help out since i cant find a working solution via google. my floppy drive isnt recognized in 12.04, adding the device in /etc/modules makes the fdd appear in lsmod, but marked red (no idea if that matters). /dev/fd0 doesnt exist anyway
[18:56] <m60> Firefox 17 is the most recent ESR and is planned to be updated through Firefox 25 (w/ 24 being the next ESR): http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/organizations/faq/
[18:57] <MisterL> any ideas on that legacy hardware? :)

[19:21] <disharmonic> for virtualbox just make sure you have your kernel headers installed. For some reason it doesnt have that as a dependency

[19:31] <disharmonic> Third3ye, yeah. a steam repo appeared on my 12.10 install. But it's lacking a GPG key and apt is complaining
[19:32] <goddard> how can i use the groove shark application integration with ubuntu?
[19:32] <carey_> how do i create a share

[19:33] <Third3ye> disharmonic: I'd say it's kind of uncessary... just download the .deb from the official web-site
[19:33] <Third3ye> unnecesary
[19:33] <IdleOne> goddard: you can try
[19:34] <disharmonic> Third3ye, i didn't add it. It must get added by an update on 12.10. But last i heard Valve wants to move steam updates to apt for ubuntu
[19:35] <disharmonic> IdleOne, thanks. I'll give that a shot
[19:35] <UlyssesGa> Good hello.  I have an interesting issue - can I bounce it off of you fellas?

[19:36] <jrib> disharmonic: well what is the repository? Seems strange it would be added automatically
[19:36] <zyad> hi
[19:37] <disharmonic> jrib it's possible that installing steam adds it

[19:38] <disharmonic> jrib, dunno. I only noticed it cause apt was complaining when i tried to update today.
[19:38] <IdleOne> jrib: it is repo.steampowered.something, it should get the GPG key on its own but sometimes things happen.

[19:39] <disharmonic> 1 sec guys. I'm booting my laptop
[19:39] <disharmonic> yeah that's the one
[19:39] <IdleOne> jrib: this may be useful info also https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve#Installation
[19:39] <UlyssesGa> Running 12.04 x86_64 (dual-boot with Win7 x86_64).  OS up-to-date.  AMD RS880 mainboard, 16GB RAM.  I upgraded from 4-core Phenom II to 8 core bulldozer (fx-8120).  After upgrade performance is terrible.  SSevere lag.  Also occurs using install CDs.  Windows is fine.
[19:41] <UlyssesGa> Additionally, no obvious culprit in dmesg, Xorg log.
[19:41] <auronandace> UlyssesGa: maybe 12.04 is too old for your processor
[19:43] <disharmonic> UlyssesGa, have you installed GPU drivers?
[19:43] <UlyssesGa> auronandace: possible but unlikely.  12.10 x86_64 install disc has the same issue.
[19:44] <jrib> disharmonic: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/222 for example lists the key
[19:45] <disharmonic> UlyssesGa, and by drivers i mean Catalyst as the open drivers can be very slow on some HW
[19:46] <auronandace> disharmonic: he changed the cpu, i'm not sure what graphics drivers has to do with it
[19:46] <disharmonic> jrib, cheers m8. I googled it earlier but i didn't see any good links(not ver thouroughly tbh though)
[19:46] <disharmonic> auronandace, i'm assuming he made a fresh install
[19:46] <UlyssesGa> disharmonic: yes - AMD catalyst 12.10 (graphics card is a HD6000 series).  Also tried radeon (I think the install discs use these by default).  VT console performance and file transfer also very sluggish.
[19:47] <UlyssesGa> I have not performed fresh install as of yet - trying to back up home directory.  taking time :-(

[19:53] <Third3ye> What the crap? Alsa hasn't been updated since the first of 2012?
[19:53] <reaga1> the problem si more than the speed at which the cursor moves in the VM
[19:53] <Third3ye> Mama mia
[19:54] <reaga1> the problem is that if MY CURSOR goes outside the reigion of the vm window, it stops capturing
[19:54] <reaga1> so there's areas where my cursor can never go

[19:56] <reaga1> disharmonic: think like this. imagine your cursor and the VM cursor as two things
[19:56] <reaga1> at different speeds
[19:56] <reaga1> my cursor is faster
[19:56] <reaga1> so imagine a square. my cursor starts in the top left
[19:56] <reaga1> if i drag my cursor to the bottom right, it will reach it before the VM cursor does
[19:56] <reaga1> my vm cursor hasnt reachedt eh corner yet, so i keep going, but its outsidde the capture area

[20:16] <disharmonic> hmm, synaptic just gave me this warning "W: Waited for dpkg --assert-multi-arch but it wasn't there - dpkgGo (10: No child processes)" Any ideas?
[20:16] <ikonia> TimeDrifter: ?
[20:16] <ActionParsnip> orudie: couldn't change the URL manually?
[20:16] <Getterac7> carey_: do you only need to log in with a specific user?
[20:17] <TimeDrifter> I forward my domain from godady to my Ubuntu apache...don't connect..
[20:17] <TimeDrifter> why?
[20:17] <carey_> Getterac7: yep just one user
[20:17] <Guest_____> Hello.
[20:17] <ikonia> TimeDrifter: ok, so it's going to be your forwarding
[20:17] <ikonia> TimeDrifter: how are ou forwarding ?
[20:17] <orudie> ActionParsnip: i found it here ) http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/alternative-downloads
[20:17] <ActionParsnip> orudie: good enough :)
[20:17] <Guest_____> I'm fairly new to the Ubuntu community, and I have a basic question as far as downloading plugins, programs, etc.
[20:17] <ActionParsnip> orudie: torrents also add extra data checks
[20:18] <Guest_____> I am not exactly sure which file type to download for Ubuntu 12.10.
[20:18] <jrib> Guest_____: what are you wanting to install?
[20:18] <ActionParsnip> Guest_____: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras     will install most of what you need
[20:18] <TimeDrifter> at my record @...I put in my server address good!!...techician says ok...but at when type in www.domainnam.com.. >>> won't connect..why?
[20:18] <Getterac7> carey_: under the share settings, add "valid users = yourusername"
[20:18] <Guest_____> I know I can use the Firefox Plugin Finder for flash for instance, but which file type would I add for my version 12.10?
[20:19] <Guest_____> Choices appear:
[20:19] <TimeDrifter> localhost() works at my apaches good!!!
[20:19] <ActionParsnip> Guest_____: plugin to achieve what exactly?
[20:19] <disharmonic> Guest_____, it's .deb. But you should rather install it using a package manager.
[20:19] <ActionParsnip> Guest_____: java? flash? what is the plugin for? saying 'plugin' means nearly nothing at all
[20:20] <Guest_____> Just anything basically, just you know how Windows main file type for programs is .exe? What is Linux's standard file type for typical programs like Skype?
[20:20] <jrib> !software | Guest_____
[20:20] <ubottu> Guest_____: A general introduction to the ways software can be installed, removed and managed in Ubuntu can be found at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoftwareManagement - See also !Packages, !Equivalents
[20:20] <ActionParsnip> Guest_____: there is more than exe in windows
[20:20] <Guest_____> Thank you.
[20:20] <Guest_____> I understand, but with typical programs such as Skype, et.
[20:20] <Guest_____> *etc.
[20:21] <disharmonic> Guest_____, for a graphical interface for that use the Ubuntu Software Center. Search for "Flash". Click on that then on install in the upper right corner
[20:21] <ActionParsnip> Guest_____: ubuntu installers use deb files, you will find most things you need are in the software centre including skype (skype is not a 'plugin')
[20:21] <carey_> Getterac7: nope not working
[20:22] <Guest_____> Okay, I'm sorry for "disturbing" you since I am do not know everything to my new OS.
[20:22] <Guest_____> *do not
[20:22] <orudie> ActionParsnip: okay, so I am writing the .sio to a USB with ultraiso one more time. What should I do if it gets stuck again? Press something ?
[20:22] <Guest_____> -.-
[20:22] <riqdiiz> [deXter], hi how you doing?
[20:22] <jrib> Getterac7: you're not disturbing.  This channel is dedicated to support!

[20:22] <awsoonn> HI all, I have seemingly messed up apt-get by installing ROS Goovy and am looking for a way to fix apt now.  http://pastebin.com/xFPCFt2s
[20:22] <disharmonic> wow, wtf...
[20:22] <Getterac7> ?
[20:23] <ActionParsnip> Guest97474: if you use simple terms, you'll get further. You'll learn your OS as you go
=== hp is now known as Guest97340
[20:23] <ActionParsnip> orudie: if its no good, try unetbootin. Be sure to MD5 test the ISO
[20:23] <jrib> awsoonn: so remove the package that isn't from the official repositories
[20:24] <awsoonn> whenever I try to use apt-get remove it gives me that error
[20:24] <carey_> Getterac7: how do i view the owner of a folder
[20:24] <Getterac7> carey_: ls -la /folder/name
[20:24] <Gryfelhase> Hi kids. I use ubuntu 12.04. In thunderbird "open link in browser" (firefox is installed) doesn't work
[20:25] <awsoonn> It also tells me to try using: sudo apt-get -f install to fix the problem which, of course, doesn't fix it :P
[20:25] <Gryfelhase> any ideas ?
[20:25] <jrib> awsoonn: where do these packages come from?
[20:25] <ActionParsnip> Gryfelhase: its a bit of a hack but I know a guide
[20:25] <awsoonn> ros.org
[20:25] <Gryfelhase> ActionParsnip: If you have a link, I 'm able to handle it (beeing pretty sure)
[20:25] <awsoonn> I would love to simply remove them for the time being, but I seem to need a bit of help to do so..
[20:26] <atrius> anyone know of any known issues with ubuntu 12.04LTS and ruby/rails apps?
[20:26] <ActionParsnip> Gryfelhase: http://hsmak.wordpress.com/2009/09/03/howto-force-thunderbird-to-open-links-in-firefox/
[20:26] <ActionParsnip> Gryfelhase: its not much hardness
[20:26] <disharmonic> synaptic just gave me this warning "W: Waited for dpkg --assert-multi-arch but it wasn't there - dpkgGo (10: No child processes)" Any ideas?

[20:29] <ClientAlive> I'm curious whether nautilus can create directory structure templates??
[20:30] <ClientAlive> or - is there another file manager that can?
[20:30] <jrib> ClientAlive: hmm, what do you mean?
[20:31] <awsoonn> jrib: It didn't work, so I took it one step further for you - http://pastebin.com/LLKtFy9s
[20:32] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: if you want to be able to right click and make a complex set of folders there, then you can use nautilus scripts to run a succession of commands to run in the folder and make the subdirs you need.
[20:32] <chichi> can someone help me out?
[20:32] <goddard> in nautilus why is the file operations window a seperate window?
[20:33] <goddard> chichi: yes
[20:33] <jrib> awsoonn: what was the output from before?
[20:33] <chichi> my wacom tablet works but has no pressure
[20:33] <ClientAlive> jrib: well, when managing my data, I notice there are some things I do repetitively - like how every semester I create a directory structure for that sem, subdirectories of each class, subdirectories to house data for each class. It would be really great if there were some form based way to do that. Perhaps be able to save a basic tamplate then when you ready to use it you can use forms to make it more specific (ie: directory names or
[20:33] <ClientAlive> such).
[20:34] <awsoonn> jrib: http://pastebin.com/CLZzbEbZ
[20:34] <chichi> http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/linuxwacom/index.php?title=Main_Page I dont really know what to do
[20:34] <ClientAlive> ActionParsnip: jrib: except I'm looking for gui based  :)
[20:34] <chichi> im not a wizard
[20:35] <jrib> ClientAlive: but the folder names depend on your input somehow?
=== Ryan is now known as Guest9299
[20:36] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: its a gui thing, you just make the script in a text editor
[20:36] <chichi> goddard do you know anything about this?
[20:37] <jrib> awsoonn: how did you install this stuff anyway?  You installed debs?
[20:38] <awsoonn> jrib: http://www.ros.org/wiki/groovy/Installation/Ubuntu  They have a ubuntu apt repo
[20:38] <jhutchins_wk> awsoonn: So why are you not asking THEM what's wrong?
[20:39] <Getterac7> carey_: i'm really not sure what the problem is... i can only show you how i've got mine set up http://pastebin.com/haiCZHH9
[20:39] <awsoonn> jrib: It looks like they failed to put a 'conflicts' between two of their packages... I have and am waiting... I thought I might be able to learn something about the dpkg system by asking here.
[20:39] <jrib> awsoonn: and you're on 12.10?
[20:39] <awsoonn> jrib: just upgraded last night from 12.04
[20:39] <ClientAlive> jrib: yes, but as it is it requires several clicks per directory as well as clicks for navigation to do it in nautilus (as it stands now). If the interface were like a for (with fields you click in and fill out) productivity would be dramatically increased. You specify the form same way you do for a table in a word processor (ie: number of directories, subdirectories, and so on). Then a form pops up based on those specs which contains a
[20:39] <ClientAlive> tree structure vies in a column on the left (like nautilus) and a form with the filds you can click in to name stuff. You cluld even condense that by allowing multiple subdirectories names created from a single fiesd and a couple drop downs.
[20:39] <disharmonic> FF really needs to get some sandbox feature, similar to that of Chrome
[20:40] <ClientAlive> *were like a form*
[20:40] <jhutchins_wk> chichi: Click on "Set Up Your Tablet"
[20:40] <jrib> ClientAlive: I'd reiterate ActionParsnip's nautilus scripts suggestion then
[20:40] <ClientAlive> jrib: ok, but, so theres no front end for that sort of thing that you know of?
[20:41] <jrib> ClientAlive: not that I know of
[20:41] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: if you can make a script to make the folders you want, you can add it as a nautilus script and it will create them where you right click
[20:42] <ClientAlive> ActionParsnip: sounds good. thx for the help. You know, it seems simple enough, someone ought to make a front end like that.  :)
[20:42] <chichi> i dont need drivers?
[20:42] <jrib> awsoonn: can you fix the vlc-nox issue by installing libmatroska5?  Alternatively, add vlc-nox to your command at http://pastebin.com/LLKtFy9s
[20:42] <fulcan> xmacroplay: could not open display "localhost:10.0", aborting. http://pastebin.com/K6JwrU7Y  ??
[20:42] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: there is, nautilus is the frontend
[20:42] <Slart> ClientAlive: why not create the empty folder template you need and just copy those each year? or it's the renaming part that is annoying?
[20:42] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: are you connecting via SSH?
[20:43] <jiffe98> I am trying to run update-grub and grub-probe fails saying out of disk but I have plenty of disk on all partitions
[20:43] <fulcan> ActionParsnip yes, and x11 forward set too.
[20:43] <ClientAlive> ActionParsnip: yeah, but it's interface design could be better <a form based file manager> <worlds first form based file manager> :)
[20:43] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: did you connect with: ssh -X username@server
[20:43] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: capital X
[20:43] <fulcan> ActionParsnip using putty
[20:43] <jhutchins_wk> jiffe98: What about inodes?
=== cal is now known as Guest91088
[20:44] <ClientAlive> c'mon ppl, have some imagination!  :>
[20:44] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: try from a terminal to test (I assume the client is Linux based)
[20:44] <awsoonn> jrib: I tried both of your suggestions to no avail. First, I can't install anything because apt is borked. second addeing vlc-nox to the command did not yield any progress
[20:44] <ActionParsnip> ClientAlive: its reinventing the wheel.
[20:44] <fulcan> ActionParsnip the target/server is linux, yes
[20:44] <blim> do you guys offer help inregards to gaming problems/
[20:45] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: but is the client system linux based too?
[20:45] <jrib> awsoonn: what's the new output?
[20:45] <fulcan> ActionParsnip no, winblows
[20:45] <fulcan> ActionParsnip hence putty
[20:45] <jhutchins_wk> awsoonn: How did you break apt?
[20:45] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: do you have xming running?
[20:45] <fulcan> I can create another linux image though
[20:45] <fulcan> I installed xming
[20:45] <chichi> "Most end users would probably only need to update the /etc/X11/xorg.conf file "
[20:45] <chichi> how do i do this

[20:46] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: is xming running though? Do you have the icon in the systray?

[20:46] <jrib> awsoonn: get rid of the vlc stuff that's broken too
[20:46] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: it needs to be running
[20:47] <chichi> but then what do i do?
[20:47] <awsoonn> jhutchins_wk: I tried to install ROS Groovy (ros.org) on U12.10 and it appears they have a missing 'conflicts' in one of their packages which has deadlocked my apt
[20:47] <Slart> CarlFK: something like this? https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/user-agent-switcher-for-c/djflhoibgkdhkhhcedjiklpkjnoahfmg
[20:47] <jrib> awsoonn: the missing conflicts doesn't seem to be the issue since libyaml-cpp isn't installed apparently

[20:52] <chichi> ok jhutchins_wk
[20:52] <chichi> what exactly do i have to do to get the pressure to work
[20:52] <jiffe98> here is the error I am getting: http://nsab.us/public/ubuntu
[20:52] <jhutchins_wk> chichi: I have no idea.
[20:53] <chichi> i just need pressure
[20:53] <zax1> so today, i went to a custoemr site who bought a CISCO UCS C220 M3S with an embedded LSI software MegaRAID. i tried installing ESXi5.1 on it with no success, tried the cisco modified image as well. even though i provisioned 2 Virtual Disks the ESXi installer could not se these and only saw the physical disks. i later heard of the FAKERAID concept, is that comon ? is there a way to make esxi...
[20:53] <zax1> ...'see' the VDs ?
[20:53] <blim> its almost like my mouse is limited to the amount or commands it can send at any one times, leaving my mouse wheel to not respond at times. very much like ghosting on a keyboard
[20:53] <jrib> awsoonn: also, fix the regex.  I guess it should be "^ros-.*" since at the moment it's selecting too much
[20:53] <Slart> blim: I'm not sure if that is necessarily a system problem, it might depend on what libraries the game is using.. it might also be specific to just some of the games.. unless it happens just on the desktop
[20:53] <chichi> it says i need to update X11 driver to get pressure
[20:53] <dumbgamer> sorry, I believe I have steam installed correctly however I cannot install games. when I try, it instantly "finishes" installation and then obviously does not work after that.
[20:53] <chichi> but how do i do that?
[20:53] <awsoonn_> jhutchins_wk, jrib: my connection died for a second. last thing I heard was to try aptitude -f install. but I don't have aptitude on this machine and since apt is borked I can't install it. I have tried apt-get -f install though: http://pastebin.com/QK7sSBz7
[20:54] <zax1> sorry wrong channel :?
[20:54] <Slart> blim: I think there might be some commands/settings to set the communication speed for the mouse.. I know I've used something like that in the past to limit that speed (for some reason being to fast created problems)
[20:54] <ActionParsnip> chichi: what is the output of:  cat /etc/issue
[20:54] <awsoonn_> jhutchins_wk, jrib: FWIW, thank you for trying to help me out. I really appreciate it. :)
[20:54] <jrib> awsoonn: My suggestion was to add the other vlc packages that were broken (see bottom of last paste) to the remove line.  also, fix the regex.  I guess it should be "^ros-.*" since at the moment it's selecting too much
[20:54] <carey_> Getterac7:you there
[20:54] <Slart> blim: can't really remember how I did it any more.. might have been an xorg.conf setting or it might have been something else

[20:55] <blim> ive seen it happen in a terminal before too when scrolling. might be a stupid question but could it have anything to do with my graphic drivers? the only diffrence i can think out when I didnt get this problem was when I was using ubuntu os drivers
[20:55] <jrib> awsoonn_: I'll return in ~15
[20:56] <carey_> Getterac7:cool, i fixed the problem i had to run this command "sudo smbpasswd -a username"

[20:57] <jhutchins_wk> awsoonn_: Did you try apt-get autoremove like it suggested?
[20:57] <Slart> blim: it wouldn't surprise me if the graphics could have something to do with it.. graphics and kernel drivers can do weird things to a system
[20:57] <Getterac7> carey_: odd.  I guess you have to set up user accounts in samba?  I thought it would use the system accounts. =/
[20:57] <awsoonn_> jhutchins_wk: after fixing the regex to ^ros* Apt- was able to remove the bad packages and then I was able to autoremove just now as well
[20:58] <carey_> Getterac7:i think that it is a configurible option in the smb.conf
[20:58] <ActionParsnip> carey_: could use:  sudo smbpasswd -a $USER    instead :)
[20:58] <jiffe98> another issue I had was the fact that this machine presents 5 disks, the local disk and 4 disks off an external chassis.  I installed to the local disk but that shows up as /dev/sde and grub tries to install on /dev/sda and fails
[20:58] <chichi> tablet would work with pressure in ubuntu?
[20:58] <xzased_> Hi there, I'm trying to install ubuntu using preseed. It all goes fine except I want to make a call to a API using curl, the problem is curl is not installed. I tried using "d-i   pkgsel/include string curl" but that didn't work
[20:58] <jiffe98> I had to continue without installing grub and then boot a recovery disk to manually install to /dev/sde
[20:58] <awsoonn_> jhutchins_wk: fwiw autoremove also failed previously.
[20:58] <chichi> i still havent installed either
[20:58] <jiffe98> is there a better way to do this?
[20:58] <Getterac7> carey_: sorry i couldn't help more.  Thanks for the info :)
[20:58] <dumbgamer> hey all. I believe I installed steam correctly however I cannot install games. when I try, it instantly "finishes" installation and then does not work
[20:58] <jhutchins_wk> awsoonn_: Looks like you're on the road to recovery.
[20:58] <orudie> how can I open the terminal ?
[20:58] <orudie> just installed ubuntu
[20:58] <blim> I wish I had tryed that before installing the drivers now, thanks for the help. Im going to try both those ideas now
[20:58] <ActionParsnip> chichi: your distro isn't supported here
[20:59] <awsoonn_> Thank you jhutchins_wk and jrib for all your help :)
[20:59] <jhutchins_wk> orudie: Ctl-Alt-F1, or look for terminal in the menu.
[20:59] <chichi> ok i will try it in ubuntu
[20:59] <jhutchins_wk> chichi: No guarantees, but many people seem to use them.

[21:01] <ClientAlive> idk, I saw "terminal" so I said, well meant to say ctrl+alt+t
[21:02] <fulcan> ActionParsnip just to clearify. I am getting the display error because ssh is trying to pop open a window inside of windows and that doesn't mix. xming is a windows only app that crosses this bridge (open linux app on winblows desktop)? assuming I was running this script in let's say apache and not ssh to run the '/root/script.pl', realistically/'more than likely' it woulds run correctly? Am I understanding this correctly?
[21:02] <srhb> How do I make LightDM see my ~/.xsession file and execute that?
[21:02] <jhutchins_wk> ClientAlive: Doesn't do anythin gon my system.
[21:03] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: as long a sxming is running and putty has been told to allow  apps to run, it will show the GUI app on the client PC
[21:03] <Zenexer> jhutchins_wk: It opens a terminal by default in Unity
[21:04] <Zenexer> And GNOME, too, I think
[21:04] <dumbgamer> how do I get games to install on the linux steam beta? the simple install option does not work.
[21:04] <srhb> dumbgamer: Some games are displayed which are not yet ready to be installed. That's an error on Steams side.
[21:04] <jhutchins_wk> Zenexer: Ah. I'm running xfce.
[21:04] <srhb> (Or maybe the game developers, not sure)
[21:05] <fulcan> ActionParsnip the reason I am asking is because my goal 'is' for apache to run the script. I am just using ssh to test. I might be doing an extra step with xming because I am an idiot, not reading the error correctly. SFD error? st00pid effin developer.
[21:06] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: did you run xming, then launch putty?
[21:06] <jhutchins_wk> fulcan: If the script is trying to open an xwindow display then it's not something that's going to run correctly wiht apache.

[21:06] <Mrokii> Hello. What could be the reason that Ubuntu has stopped mounting an inserted CD/DVD? I have Cairo-Dock installed and everytime I insert a CD/DVD I get the message "CD/Dvd drive successfully unmounted".
[21:06] <dumbgamer> I hate to say but you're right. I checked the compatible games list and the 3 I tried weren't on there.. tried one on the list and sure enough it worked. thanks.

[21:07] <fulcan> jhutchins_wk ok. then this raises the fundemental question of direction of execution. I don't want the script running on my desktop. I want the script to run on the desktop of a user on the server. client launches ap only.
[21:07] <toordog> is anyone here very good with ldap? i'm having issue with creating basic ldif file following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/openldap-server.html
[21:07] <toordog> I think my issue could be related to the password setting of backend.domain.ldif olcRootPw
[21:07] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: try:  export DISPLAY=0.0   then run the command :)
[21:08] <ActionParsnip> fulcan: the app will appear on the display of the system you are connecting to (assuming it has an X server)
[21:08] <fulcan> xmacroplay: could not open display "0.0", aborting.
[21:09] <jhutchins_wk> fulcan: Generally we try to prevent that kind of malware from working.
=== Guest9299 is now known as ryanclancy000
[21:09] <Zenexer> Why 0.0?  Shouldn't it just be 0 (or is it :0?  I can never remember)
[21:09] <fulcan> jhutchins_wk this time it needs to work
[21:10] <fulcan> :0 for display
[21:10] <jhutchins_wk> fulcan: What I'm saying is that the system is designed to prevent it.
[21:10] <odla> how can i connect to my ubuntu desktop from my mac laptop using VNC?
[21:10] <fulcan> I need to undesgn it.
[21:10] <fulcan> What do I rip out?
[21:11] <jhutchins_wk> fulcan: The operating system on the target computer.
[21:11] <fulcan> yup
[21:11] <Zenexer> fulcan: You'll probably need to run some sort of script on the client's end to download whatever scripts you want to run and run them
[21:11] <jhutchins_wk> fulcan: You need to re-think what you're trying to do and figure out a different way to do it.
[21:11] <compdoc> odla, ubuntu comes with vino, for desktop sharing. You have to be logged in to share it
[21:11] <fulcan> Zenexer target desktop is a ghost user.
[21:11] <Zenexer> You can't run a script on the client directly through that sort of connection
[21:12] <jhutchins_wk> odla: You can also install one of several vnc servers on ubuntu and yes, connect from a mac.
[21:12] <fulcan> through x
[21:12] <odla> jhutchins_wk: how would i do this?
[21:12] <ActionParsnip> !vnc | odla
[21:12] <ubottu> odla: VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[21:12] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[21:13] <ActionParsnip> odla: if you can detail what you intend to do on the remote system, I may be able to suggest a sleeker solution

[21:13] <odla> ActionParsnip: basically i want to run R code remotely on my desktop from my laptop

[21:13] <bekks> compdoc: Antaranian: Go get a room please...
[21:13] <compdoc> heh
[21:13] <ActionParsnip> odla: does that happen in a terminal?
[21:14] <odla> ActionParsnip: yup entirely
[21:14] <ActionParsnip> odla: then why do you need VNC...
[21:14] <Antaranian> when I do "zip -r path/to/zip /path/to/dir/from/root/" I see all directories from root in archive
[21:14] <odla> ActionParsnip: because i could use the gui RStudio to do some editing from time to time
[21:14] <ActionParsnip> odla: install openssh-server and you can use ssh to connect to the PC. You will then have the same terminal, it will run a TONNE faster and use a lot less resources
[21:14] <blim> by any change does anyone know how to stop a game from changing my desktop rez?
[21:15] <Antaranian> how can I have just node folder ?
[21:15] <Zenexer> blim: That's up to the game; you'll have to mess with the game's settings
[21:15] <ficabolsa> ciao
[21:15] <blim> ok cheers
[21:15] <odla> ActionParsnip: will i be able to connect to it from a coffee shop? i.e. do i have to be local to connect to it?
[21:16] <ActionParsnip> odla: sure, just port forward port 22/tcp to the system and you can connect from anywhere ever :)
[21:16] <Zenexer> odla: You'll need to port forward on your home router, most likely.
[21:16] <jhutchins_wk> Antaranian: Probably the easiest way is to run zip from that folder - but it's usually best to be one folder up from the target so the zip doesn't just dump everything in the CWD.
[21:16] <Zenexer> But the same goes for any remote service
[21:16] <odla> ActionParsnip: is there a wiki that i can follow?
[21:17] <Superpig> Hi. I'm trying to use 12.10 in LiveCD mode. I can get as far as the 'Try Ubuntu' button in the startup dialogue, but when I click it, the desktop comes up, but a few seconds later the system (apparently) stops responding and one of my two monitors switches off
[21:17] <ActionParsnip> odla: installing a package then port forwarding in the specific router you have?
[21:17] <jhutchins_wk> odla: Port forwarding depends on what router you have.
[21:17] <toordog> is anyone here very good with ldap? i'm having issue with creating basic ldif file following this tutorial: https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/openldap-server.html
[21:17] <toordog> is there a way to leave feedback on poorly written documentation on help.ubuntu.com?
[21:17] <Zenexer> I don't know about a wiki, but there are plenty of tutorials if you google your router, usually
[21:17] <Superpig> the system doesn't respond to ctrl-alt-backspace or ctrl-sysreq-k. I tried REISUB and the first time it rebooted on the B but the second time it just didn't seem to do anything.
[21:17] <ActionParsnip> odla: you will need yur router manual.... the package install is like any other package
[21:17] <jhutchins_wk> odla: I would recommend using a port other than 22 to avoid brute force attacks.
[21:17] <fulcan> wtf?  usermod: group 'wheel' does not exist
[21:18] <odla> ActionParsnip: oh so i have to do port forwarding in my router not on you ubuntu? all i need for that is my ip right?
[21:18] <odla> jhutchins_wk: ok
[21:18] <Zenexer> fulcan: Ubuntu doesn't use wheel; it uses sudo and admin
[21:18] <ActionParsnip> odla: yes, you allow the traffic through
[21:18] <Zenexer> fulcan: Type sudo visudo for more info
[21:18] <jhutchins_wk> odla: Pick a port like 222 on the router, forward it to 22 on your ubuntu box, and run openssh-server on that box.
[21:18] <ActionParsnip> odla: you can then use http://www.ipchicken.com to see your WAN IP. If you are out and about you can connect to that IP and get the same link
[21:19] <ActionParsnip> odla: openssh-server will also give you an SFTP server so you can securely transfer files to and from the system :)
[21:19] <Superpig> I've tried both x64 and x86 LiveCDs. (The system is a Core i7)
[21:20] <Superpig> I noticed the first time with the x64 disk that there were some error messages about failure to mount filesystems and stuff - I actually thought the boot had halted for a bit but then it went into the GUI section

[21:20] <RELOL> I have packet loss on wifi
[21:20] <Zenexer> Superpig: Try unplugging one of your monitors.  The LiveCD doesn't usually come with the special drivers for fancy graphics cards.
[21:20] <RELOL> 70%
[21:21] <Superpig> It's a GeForce GTX 580

[21:21] <ActionParsnip> Superpig: and which Intel CPU please?
[21:21] <Superpig> I don't suppose it matters which monitor I unplug?

[21:24] <ActionParsnip> RELOL: does the router have it's own modem built in or does it have a separate modem?
[21:25] <ActionParsnip> odla: you can use the 'nohup' command
[21:25] <Superpig> alright, I'll try that, and if it doesn't work I'll unplug a monitor, and if that doesn't work I'll come back. Thanks folks. :)
[21:25] <RELOL> ActionParsnip, it's own modem but i've tried with another laptop with intel wifi card and i had no proplems

[21:44] <jiffe98> is there a better way to do this?
[21:44] <pragmaticenigma> jacobfogg: Another possible solution is to do you DEV inside a virtual machine.  That way you don't have to reinstall you main machine.  You can setup file sharing to allow both systems access to some of your files.

[22:07] <kunji> Intuitively I would think that Ubuntu starts on that page with the small piece of the hard drive, but I'm not going to guarantee it.
[22:07] <mesquka> wbf: what version are you trying to compile here?
[22:08] <ActionParsnip> wbf: is there no ppa?
[22:08] <Slart> rumblebumble: does it look something like this? http://askubuntu.com/questions/150550/installing-ubuntu-with-windows-which-is-left-and-right-when-allocating-space
[22:08] <wbf> mesquka, Not sure
[22:08] <wbf> ActionParsnip, No I don't think there is. I have to compile for my ARM box
[22:08] <rumblebumble> Slart, that is it
[22:08] <rumblebumble> thanks
[22:09] <rumblebumble> Slart, WOW thanks
[22:09] <Slart> rumblebumble: everyone in that thread seems to agree that windows is on the left and ubuntu on the right.. and it seems that the bug is already reported =)
[22:09] <mesquka> wbf: try this:
[22:09] <Slart> rumblebumble: you're welcome
[22:10] <rumblebumble> Slart, Awesome thanks again, cheers
[22:10] <mesquka> wbf: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1514687/
[22:11] <wbf> why mesquka? do I just need an update?
[22:11] <mesquka> wbf: I'd try to avoid compiling from source
[22:12] <wbf> mesquka, okay but that's only what I could find
[22:12] <mesquka> wbf: it's better to just use .deb packages
[22:13] <cmj141> hello
[22:13] <mesquka> wbf: http://kernel.ubuntu.com have a look around here, they might have some precompiled kernels for you
[22:13] <mesquka> wbf: compiling from source is always tricky
[22:14] <cmj141> I have a question. I have a 524 mb filesystem made for my grub and grub 2 folders.. is that too much space for that?
[22:15] <wbf> mesquka, still installing that kernel...
[22:15] <dennisn_> Is it possible to remap what Alt-F2 (currently "run command") does in unity (2d) ?
[22:15] <dennisn_> google is telling me confusing and mixed messages -- that it's possible with "compiz/3d" .. but not with the "2d" version?
[22:16] <pragmaticenigma> cmj141: You can have any size as long as it is greater than 200MB.
[22:16] <Slart> dennisn_: if you're using compiz it kind of takes over this functionality and you can change it with compizconfig-settingsmanager.. I'm not sure that works when you're running unity2d
[22:17] <dennisn_> yea, i don't have compiz/3d
[22:17] <dennisn_> should i? will it slow down my machine?
[22:17] <cmj141> i use compiz
[22:17] <dennisn_> what advantages does it offer?
[22:17] <Slart> dennisn_: you are sure you're actually running unity2d? I thought it was deprecated in favour of running some kind of software rendering stuff
[22:17] <dennisn_> i'm not sure :p
[22:17] <pragmaticenigma> cmj141: Assuming your talking about the /boot partition
[22:17] <cmj141> i just got done configuring the damn thing
[22:18] <dennisn_> how can i tell? i tried running that compiz confuration thingy, but it didn't change anything
[22:18] <Slart> dennisn_: afaik there's no real advantage in running compiz.. unless you count wobbly windows as something important =)
[22:18] <dennisn_> i count remapping alt-f2 as an advantage :s
[22:18] <dennisn_> it's disabled in the keyboard shortcuts default settings :|
[22:18] <pragmaticenigma> dennisn_: Compiz enables "eye-candy"  it really doesn't benefit your machine functionality
[22:18] <cmj141> pragmaticenigma, yes the the boot loader theres also a lost+foud and efi folder in it as with some files
[22:19] <Slart> dennisn_: but it is the way ubuntu is going.. I'm not sure how much time is put into non-accelerated graphics stuff any more
[22:19] <wbf> mesquka, How do I boot into that kernel?
[22:19] <dennisn_> i just want keyboard mapping to work :P
[22:19] <dennisn_> err, shortcut mapping
[22:19] <Slart> dennisn_: let me google around for a bit.. see if I can find something about unity2d and remapping the keys
[22:19] <pragmaticenigma> cmj141: You should be fine with 500 MB... Remember that you will want the extra room for kernel updates, since older kernal are not automatically removed.
[22:19] <cmj141> compiz is just something fun and cool to have, eats resources but only makes swapping workspaces entertaining
[22:20] <cmj141> whats the difference b/t the compiz 2d and 3d?
[22:20] <pragmaticenigma> dennisn_: keyboard mapping usually doesn't have anything to do with compiz... that's a window manager setting (window manager being Gnome, KDE, etc..)
[22:20] <wbf> mesquka, Has the same error
[22:20] <Slart> dennisn_: this might be worth looking at.. at least to start with http://gianluca.dellavedova.org/2011/10/18/change-hotkey-to-activate-dash-in-unity-2d/
[22:21] <dennisn_> pragmaticenigma, i know -- but compiz was, so far, the only thing that is supposed to work
[22:21] <dennisn_> pragmaticenigma, does your (ubuntu) window manager let you remap alt-f2?
[22:21] <mesquka> wbf: right, I'm not sure what the problem is
[22:21] <sevenforall> I downloaded a .so plugin for Pidgin, does anyone know how to install it?
[22:21] <Mrokii> Hey, what could be the reason that Ubuntu is unable to mount self burned data DVDs? Whenever I put them and try to mount them I get this error: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sr0, missing codepage or helper program, or other error In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try dmesg | tail  or so
[22:22] <mesquka> wbf: is gcc configured correctly
[22:22] <pragmaticenigma> dennisn_: Not easily, it's considered a standard shortcut and should not be changed
[22:22] <mesquka> wbf: run gcc -v
[22:22] <dennisn_> lolz
[22:22] <dennisn_> and sigh
[22:23] <dennisn_> what does "not easily" mean -- recompiling and hacking the code?
[22:24] <pragmaticenigma> dennisn_: Not necessarily, but it's not going to be found in compiz settings.  If your running straight up Ubuntu 12.xx you will not be able to change it since I do not know of any Unity configuration tools to make the change
[22:24] <dennisn_> pragmaticenigma, there is a compiz settings manager that offers the option
[22:24] <dennisn_> it just doesn't work with unity2d
[22:24] <cmj141> prag, thanks for the information, I was thinking it was too much space. haha i guess its not.  just wondering because seems like alot of free space
[22:24] <pragmaticenigma> dennisn_: It can't override the window manager
[22:24] <dennisn_> then why does it offer the option?
[22:25] <pragmaticenigma> dennisn_: The window manager takes precedence over compiz.  You might be able to configure it there, but Unity is intercepting the command before compiz can see it.
[22:25] <dennisn_> my question stands :P
[22:25] <Slart> pragmaticenigma, dennisn_: ccsm does override that key combo, I just tried it
[22:26] <cmj141> i have another silly question, what is the main folder persay that software installs to.. im trying to hunt down software i installed but dont know how to run it(no icon)
[22:26] <pragmaticenigma> dennisn_: Therefor it won't work.  You will need to find a utility to modify Unity's keyboard shortcuts.
[22:26] <dennisn_> Slart, are you using 32d?
[22:26] <trijntje> bit of a strange question: who can tell me which programming language this is? http://pastebin.com/xhpqfLEy
[22:26] <dennisn_> 3d?
[22:26] <Slart> dennisn_: 3d
[22:26] <dennisn_> right
[22:26] <dennisn_> so i guess that's the only "solution" ? :s
[22:26] <CanadianPirate> Ok, this may seem like a silly question, but can I add color to the MOTD when I login via a TTY shell?
[22:26] <CanadianPirate> I know the file is /etc/motd
[22:26] <trijntje> cmj141: you can use dpkg -L packagename to list all files for a package
[22:26] <ActionParsnip> dennisn_: i'd use 32d ;)
[22:26] <dennisn_> :)
[22:26] <dennisn_> you need DMT for that
[22:26] <Slart> trijntje: bash?
[22:26] <pragmaticenigma> trijntje: It's a bash script
[22:26] <mesquka> wbf: run gcc -v if that doesn't return any errors try the forums, soory
[22:27] <cmj141> trint, that looks like C with the if else statements
[22:27] <Slart> trijntje: or rather.. as the top line suggests..  just "sh"
[22:27] <cmj141> but then again other languages couuld be using "if else" in their language as well
[22:27] <BAT-21> How hard would it be to set up an ircd on a paid domain?
[22:27] <pragmaticenigma> cmj141: It's bash, as indicated by the first line containing "#! /usr/sh"
[22:28] <cmj141> trint, i do know that C++ uses (if else) statements
[22:28] <pragmaticenigma> Sorry /bin/sh
[22:28] <Slart> cmj141: bash/sh has those contructs as well..
[22:28] <cmj141> oh cool! didint know that!
[22:28] <ActionParsnip> BAT-21: shouldn't be too hard
[22:28] <cmj141> thanks
[22:28] <Slart> cmj141: although not as advanced.. but still =)
[22:28] <cmj141> i should probably learn bash haha
[22:28] <sipane> CanadianPirate you may want to take a look in /etc/update-motd.d$
[22:28] <pragmaticenigma> cmj141: A lot of languages use those contructs... Perl, Python, PHP, C
[22:30] <trijntje> pragmaticenigma: and what language is /bin/sh? I need to understand what that script does and be able to modify it, but  I dont even know where to start
[22:30] <kunji> dennisn_: using alt+f2 totally works
[22:30] <jhutchins_wk> trijntje: Not surprizingly /bin/sh is sh.
[22:30] <dennisn_> kunji, you can change it, in unity2d?
[22:30] <pragmaticenigma> trijntje: We've already told you... It's a BASH script file
[22:30] <ActionParsnip> trijntje: shell script, usually bash
[22:30] <jhutchins_wk> pragmaticenigma: Strictly speaking /bin/sh is not the same as /bin/bash
[22:31] <kunji> In 3d at least I don't have trouble with it, lemme switch a machine to 2d to verify that, but it should be the same
[22:31] <cmj141> trij, thanks ! i havent used terminal in 8 years.. all i remember is apt-get install hah
[22:32] <Mrokii> Can somebody tell me if Ubuntu able to read DVDs with the Joliet filesystem? The reason is that I think my burned DVDs may be in that filesystem, as they can't be mounted.
[22:32] <dRetY> deneme
[22:32] <matteo_> ciao
[22:32] <matteo_> !list
[22:32] <ubottu> matteo_: No warez here! This is not a file sharing channel (or network); read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».
[22:32] <Slart> trijntje: it's what you can write at the terminal prompt on almost any linux machine.. ls, whoami, rm and so on are bash commands
[22:33] <Slart> trijntje: there are man pages for bash/sh and lots and lots of documentation out there on the net.. google for "bash scripting" .. you'll find lots and lots
[22:33] <Pici> Slart: They're all executables. They can be run without bash being there.
[22:33] <rumblebumble> Slart, Just wondering if you know anything about dual booting with windows 8. The installer completed everything looked great. Now it reports an a secure boot error when booting then boots into windows. Did I do something wrong
[22:34] <Slart> Pici: even ls and rm?
[22:34] <kunji> dennisn_: Seems to be working, here's what I did: go to All Settings -> Keyboard then to the Shortcuts tab, choose custom shortcuts, add one, give it any name and as a test command I used gksudo gedit.  Then it will show up with disabled on the right, click on disabled then press the shortcut you want to use (alt+f2), then it should work when you press alt+f2 and prompt for your password, then it will open gedit when you give it.
[22:34] <matteo_> !alis
[22:34] <ubottu> alis is a services bot that can help you find channels. Read "/msg alis help list" for help and ask any questions about it in #freenode. Example usage: /msg alis list #ubuntu* or /msg alis list *http*
[22:34] <Pici> Slart: yes. they're all part of coreutils.
[22:34] <Slart> Pici: oh.. my bad.. no dessert for me
[22:34] <Pici> Slart: tis okay, its easy to forget since they're so ubiquitous.
[22:35] <kunji> Mrokii: You might want to look at some of the Medibuntu repos
[22:35] <dennisn_> kunji, fascinating!
[22:35] <trijntje> Slart: so /bin/sh is the same as /bin/bash, and that script is a bash script?
[22:35] <jhutchins_wk> rumblebumble: Welcome to secureboot.
[22:35] <jhutchins_wk> rumblebumble: I think you can turn that off in the bios.
[22:35] <Slart> trijntje: sorry.. as pici said.. ls, rm and probably whoami as well are standalone executables.. but "man bash" will tell you lots about what can be done
[22:35] <cryptic> does anyone know whether multi-monitor support in ubuntu (or linux, generally) still sucks? I have an nvidia quadro nvs 420 (to which 4 monitors are attached) and a quadro 4000 (one monitor), but when I tried last summer, multi-monitor support was very glitchy and the overall user experience was terrible
[22:36] <cryptic> compared to windows 7
[22:36] <bekks> trijntje: On Ubuntu /bin/sh is a symlink to /bin/dash
[22:36] <FloodBot1> cryptic: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[22:36] <jhutchins_wk> rumblebumble: Microsoft's plan to keep you from modifying your PC.
[22:36] <cryptic> um
[22:36] <Pici> trijntje: sh and bash aren't exactly the same thing, but they're similar.
[22:36] <matteo_>     /msg |numero_BOT| xdcc send #file
[22:36] <Slart> trijntje: bash and sh are almost the same.. bash is meant to be used by a human, it comes with some extra flashy stuff.. sh is meant to be simple and a bit more efficient since it would mostly be run as a script
[22:36] <cryptic> someone fix FloodBot1, because it can't have it both ways
[22:36] <jhutchins_wk> cryptic: Generally linux multi-monitor support is a lot better than Windows'.
[22:37] <Pici> cryptic: it was probably just lag. We know you're not spamming.
[22:37] <cryptic> jhutchins_wk: I wouldn't say generally. I'd say *possibly*, depending on devices, drivers, configurations
[22:37] <Slart> trijntje: I don't know the differences by heart but there are some smaller stuff that differs
[22:37] <cryptic> on windows, it usually just works, since vendors cater to the dominant market. but that's neither here nor there.
[22:37] <rumblebumble> I thought there was a secure boot solution, I thought they got grub signed
[22:38] <jhutchins_wk> cryptic: Windows can be very difficult to get things like that working on, and your options are often quite restricted.  For instance, I have to have the same wallpaper on each of my extended desktops.
[22:38] <trijntje> Slart: ah ok, thanks. Things are starting to make sense now
[22:39] <Slart> trijntje: you're welcome
[22:39] <jhutchins_wk> cryptic: THere are a lot of things where getting the right, current driver and getting it working with Windows is much worse than on Linux, because Windows tries to do it for you and doesn't tell you what's going on.
[22:39] <pragmaticenigma> rumblebumble: The jury is still out on that.
[22:39] <Netbus> cryptic: Why not load up a Live CD of the latest ubuntu to test it?  Or possibly, Fedora?
[22:40] <jhutchins_wk> trijntje: bash and dash are pretty much extensions of sh, and both contain a full set of sh commands and conventions.  When either one is called by a symlink from sh they run as sh.
[22:40] <F3Speech> Evening all
[22:40] <cryptic> I was considering a couple different approaches, though: I was considering running xen with a windows 7 guest and ubuntu guest(s). I just don't know how to conviently virtualize monitors, I guess
[22:40] <jhutchins_wk> trijntje: sh is usually not installed seperately.
[22:41] <cryptic> Netbus: I suppose I'll try. I just fried my windows 7 install, anyway, so I'll need a livecd now
[22:41] <Netbus> cryptic: timing is everything.
[22:41] <ActionParsnip> Netbus: from the IBM linux advert?
[22:41] <rumblebumble> jhutchins_wk, thanks, I thought that was all figured out
[22:42] <Netbus> cryptic: If ubuntu doesn't work out with the monitors, i'd give fedora a shot.
[22:42] <Netbus> best of luck.
[22:42] <jhutchins_wk> rumblebumble: iirc Red Hat paid Microsoft or Intel to get a secureboot signature.  I don't know whether Canonical did.
[22:42] <trijntje> jhutchins_wk: so if I would learn bash better I will learn the 'sh' part and some extra stuf, and then I would be able to properly read /bin/sh scripts?
[22:43] <jhutchins_wk> trijntje: Yes.
[22:43] <F3Speech> Ive got a strange problem with my apache2 setup. I have 2 websites on the server /var/www/site1/ and /var/www/site2/ when i goto http://serverip/ i get site1, when i goto http://serverip/site1/ i get 404 and when i goto http://serverip/site2/ i get 404. Anyone point me in the direction of the config that sorts all this?
[22:43] <jhutchins_wk> trijntje: Mostly stuff that won't work in sh will be noted as such.
[22:44] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: /var/log/apach2/errors.log
[22:44] <jrib> F3Speech: also you should pastebin the relevant configuration files...
[22:44] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk:  nothing in there buy some mysql connection errors
[22:45] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: If you're getting 404's those should be logged.
[22:45] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: You could look at access.log, but it shouldn't show the 404s.
[22:45] <Mrokii> kunji: I will, thanks.
[22:46] <trijntje> jhutchins_wk: cool, thanks a lot!
[22:47] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: access.log is empty
[22:49] <ActionParsnip> F3Speech: i'd ask in #httpd too :)
[22:50] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: We start to suspect that you have deviated from the stock configuration.
[22:51] <F3Speech> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1514752/
[22:51] <djshotglass> are there user repositories?
[22:51] <djshotglass> like AUR for arch linux
[22:51] <djshotglass> i want to install aircrack
=== fu_fu is now known as desmo
[22:52] <F3Speech> quite possible, i know nothing at all about apache :/ any idiot could setup and use iis ive never had the plesure of working with apache in my work
[22:52] <djshotglass> (and for those of you about to say build it from source, i might as well be on gentoo if i have to do that for everything)
[22:54] <F3Speech> ActionParsnip: thank ill take a look if jhutchins_wk cant dig me out :)
[22:55] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: it like there a sitewise redirect to /site1/ but where would that be configured?
[22:55] <F3Speech> sitewide*
=== ermlich is now known as soong
=== desmo is now known as fu_fu
[22:59] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: any ideas or should I hop over to #httpd as ActionParsnip suggested
[23:03] <kunji> djshotglass: Hmm, well if you're looking for the builtin aircrack setup you should look at Backtrack Linux instead of Ubuntu.  I really have no idea what it's status is with regard to Ubuntu.
[23:05] <mladoux> if you want to remain closer to ubuntu, I'd go with backbox as an alternative
[23:05] <mladoux> backtrack does a lot of modifications
[23:05] <mladoux> backbox is pretty much pentesting utils packaged for ubuntu LTS
[23:05] <djshotglass> your solution to installing aircrack is to use another operating system?
[23:06] <djshotglass> really? lol
[23:06] <mladoux> djshotglass if your using Ubuntu 12.04, you can add the backbox repo
[23:06] <mladoux> http://wiki.backbox.org/index.php/Repositories_for_Debian/Ubuntu
[23:07] <djshotglass> nice
[23:07] <djshotglass> thank you
[23:07] <kunji> djshotglass: You're funny man, why should you assume I'm an expert on aircrack, I've heard of it, but never messed with it, what you're saying suggests that it's not in the repos and you haven't found a ppa, and you don't want to build from source, so there's not much left.
[23:07] <mladoux> aircrack is in that repo, along with metasploit and a bunch of other tools
[23:08] <mladoux> but it's for 12.04, there are not quantal packages in it yet.
[23:09] <djshotglass> 12.04 is LTS right?
[23:09] <djshotglass> pretty sure thats what im on
[23:09] <bekks> Yes.
[23:09] <mladoux> Yeah
[23:09] <mladoux> you can check, are you using precise?
[23:09] <bekks> djshotglass: You can check it using "lsb_release -sd"
[23:09] <mladoux> what bekks said
[23:09] <mladoux> lol
[23:09] <djshotglass> Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS
[23:09] <mladoux> yeah
[23:09] <djshotglass> :) ty all
[23:10] <MK`> What is the name of the laptop battery applet in 11.10 for gnome fallback? Mine crashed, want to reenable it.
[23:10] <mladoux> Don't upgrade to 12.10 unless you know what your doing, that is if you want to use those tools without recompiling.
[23:10] <djshotglass> i dont upgrade unless i have to for something
[23:10] <djshotglass> dont fix what isnt broken iv learned with linux
[23:10] <mladoux> pretty much.
[23:11] <mladoux> LTS is still supported
[23:11] <mladoux> they'll upgrade eventually. but i think they just upgrade with LTS versions
[23:11] <Ben64> 12.04 will be supported until April 2017
[23:11] <mladoux> also, their packages are optimized for XFCE, just keep that in mind
[23:12] <mladoux> you should still be able to use them with any GUI, but they might not look right visually
[23:12] <mladoux> if you care about that sort of thing
[23:13] <mladoux> backbox does have more tools, but they really modify the base Ubuntu distro.
[23:13] <mladoux> sorry
[23:13] <mladoux> backtrack, not backbox*
[23:15] <JonEdney> I don't know how I feel about Known_problems joining the channel.  Wouldn't that indicate that problems are now present? :)
[23:16] <smith_> could someone advice a commandline tool to convert lit format to txt?
[23:17] <Glacer232> heya, why is ubuntu 32 bit the recommended over 64 bit?
[23:17] <Ben64> Glacer232: not everyone has 64 bit
[23:19] <wdp> Ben64, thats the most weird reason i ever heard for why something/someone recommends to  use a 32bit version of something.
[23:19] <mladoux> JonEdney, which would you rather have, problems that you know about and can work around, or problems that are hidden from you catching you by surprise?
[23:19] <JonEdney> Wise words.
[23:19] <JonEdney> Where is none of the above? :)
[23:19] <Ben64> wdp: 32 bit works on 32 and 64
[23:19] <Ben64> 64 only works on 64
[23:19] <hexstatik> when i was installing ubuntu and i was editing the partition on my SSD, it dissapeared and now linux nor windows can see the SSD, can anyone advise?
[23:20] <mladoux> Glacer232, 32-bit has been around longer, and tends to have less issues when it counts.
[23:20] <mladoux> most people won't even notice the difference.
[23:20] <iceroot> Glacer232: its recommend because amd64 does not run on every system, 32bit does
[23:20] <Glacer232> Ah I see, thanks
[23:21] <mladoux> iceroot: don't forget sparc and arm, lol 32 bit runs on 2 different types of systems, not every system.
[23:21] <iceroot> Glacer232: but when the hardware supports amd64, this is the recommend version
[23:21] <iceroot> mladoux: s/32bit/x86 :)
[23:21] <mladoux> yeah, exactly
[23:21] <iceroot> mladoux: and sparc is always 64bit
[23:21] <iceroot> imo
[23:21] <mladoux> iceroot that is not true either
[23:21] <mladoux> I've got an old 32-bit sparc system lying around, but I don't think any modern linux will run on it.
[23:22] <DangerRoss> amd64 sucks
[23:22] <wdp> Ben64, just saying, if i have to choose between 32 and 64bit - and i know i've got a 64bit system, why should i care about that 64bit might not run everywhere? I have a 64bit system, so it WILL run here. which is why your explaination (as well as the explaination of iceroot) is pretty weird.
[23:22] <iceroot> mladoux: must be a very old system, the sparc systems we have are all 64bit
[23:22] <Ben64> wdp: if you know you have a 64 bit system, then you get 64 bit, its not rocket surgery
[23:22] <mladoux> iceroot it is very old, it's from the 80's
[23:22] <mladoux> or early 90s possibly
[23:22] <kunji> ... waiting for some 128 bit distros...
[23:23] <iceroot> wdp: what if you dont know what amd64 is and your system is x86 and the installer does not start? because of that x86 is recommend on the website
[23:23] <Ben64> DangerRoss: no
[23:23] <mladoux> kunji you might need to wait a while, we're still at the beginning of 64-bit
[23:23] <iceroot> mladoux: all the 199x systems are 64bit imo
[23:23] <DangerRoss> amd is for girls
[23:23] <bekks> iceroot: Thats wrong.
[23:23] <iceroot> mladoux: even the 200mhz sparc systems
[23:24] <kunji> mladoux: I know, though some specialized systems have been doing 128 it will be years before it become anywhere near normal
[23:24] <iceroot> bekks: sparc, not x86
[23:24] <blahblahblahblah> what is the best way to upgrade from 10.10 to 12.04 LTS?
[23:24] <kunji> *becomes
[23:24] <iceroot> !eol | blahblahblahblah
[23:24] <ubottu> blahblahblahblah: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[23:24] <iceroot> blahblahblahblah: see the last link
[23:24] <bekks> blahblahblahblah: The only way is to update to 11.04 -> 11.10 -> 12.04
[23:24] <iceroot> blahblahblahblah: you have to go to 11.04, 11.0, 12.04
[23:24] <mladoux> meh, they weren't 64-bit till 1995 i think, with the sparc64
[23:24] <blahblahblahblah> thanks for the link.. will check it out
[23:25] <wdp> iceroot, well, then the reason why 32bit is recommended is because the guys who recommended it assumed that the average user does not know about 32/64bit and hence should use 32bit as it's know to run everywhere? :) I don't want to start offtopic here, though. I was just curious myself why 32bit is recommended (like.. does the 64bit variant has any bugs? is it's development not as good as the 32bit one? is 32bit more tested? <- that'd be actually good re
[23:25] <wdp> asons why something is recommended over something else)
[23:25] <iceroot> mladoux: i will do a research later, i thought since 199x all the systems were sparc64
[23:25] <mladoux> anyway, we're off topic now
[23:25] <Ben64> wdp: you've been answered multiple times now
[23:25] <mladoux> iceroot, lol, it's okay, I'm not sure on the exact year of the switch either.
[23:25] <iceroot> mladoux: :)
[23:25] <mladoux> I got the machine second hand, I don't know when it was built
[23:26] <mladoux> it's a sun 4, i think
[23:26] <mladoux> I'm not digging it out
[23:26] <iceroot> mladoux: but of course you want to use solaris and other systems on that instead of GNU/Linux :)
[23:26] <iceroot> open-solaris, bsd and so on but we will start offtopic here :)
[23:26] <kunji> wdp: Yeah, pretty much just for people that don't know, though there are occasionally cases where the 32 bit works and the 64 doesn't for a driver or something...
[23:27] <wdp> yep, got it already .)
[23:27] <kunji> ^_^
[23:28] <hexstatik> when i was installing ubuntu and i was editing the partition on my SSD, it dissapeared and now linux nor windows can see the SSD, can anyone advise?
=== aberrant__ is now known as aberrant
[23:28] <mladoux> my daughter is so cute, she was jumping in her jumper, and all the sudden she stopped, she tuckered her self out and passed out with a thumb in her mouth.
[23:28] <iceroot> wdp: for opensource software, there is no difference because you can rebuild the software for amd64, for closed source the vendor needs to provide a 64bit build, if he does not (skype for example, non-free drivers) then you may face issues bit normally amd64 is running fine like x86
[23:29] <kunji> hexstatik: Can you see it listed in linux with the command sudo fdisk -l      ?
[23:29] <mladoux> iceroot it's running sunos on it, it's pre-solaris, but yeah.
[23:29] <caiotarifa> Hey Guys, can anyone help me? http://serverfault.com/questions/464264/vsftpd-3-0-2-on-ubuntu-12-04-init-file/464282#comment513845_464282
=== Guest29963 is now known as Joschii
[23:30] <hexstatik> yes i can kunji
[23:30] <iceroot> mladoux: and as it seems ubuntu stopped sparc support after 10.04.
[23:30] <mladoux> lol
[23:30] <iceroot> mladoux: but 8.04 was running fine on the old sparc systems
[23:31] <mladoux> there are custom offshoots. I could reminisce about this all day, lol
[23:31] <kunji> hexstatik: ok, so your drive probably isn't dead, it may need to be reformatted though.  Do you need to recover any data from it or would you be fine to open up gparted and reformat?
[23:31] <hexstatik> no
[23:31] <hexstatik> i was gonna install linux on it
[23:31] <hexstatik> sec
[23:31] <caiotarifa> Has anyone installed VSFTPd 3.0.2 on Ubuntu?
[23:31] <hexstatik> gparted doesnt see it

[23:32] <hexstatik> nvm it does now
[23:32] <mladoux> Found it iceroot, 32-bit sparc was still being produced, but the first 64-bit sparc was released in 1993, per Wikipedia, so take it with a grain of salt. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC
[23:32] <kunji> Ah, good, I was gonna say, I've never had gparted fail to see something fdisk saw.
[23:33] <hexstatik> thats wierd it didnt work 2 days ago
[23:33] <hexstatik> now it sees it
[23:33] <hexstatik> its like when u take ur car to the mechanic scenario
[23:33] <iceroot> mladoux: thank you for the search, so i was wrong and it was a little bit later then i thought
[23:33] <Ben64> hexstatik: computers get scared when technicians are around, i see it happen all the time

[23:35] <caiotarifa> I have a problem to create a init.d for VSFTPd 3.0.2 on Ubuntu 12.04. There is an example of this file?
[23:35] <blahblahblahblah> ok.. so i put in the EOL sources list, do an update, then upgrade then do-release-upgrade?
[23:35] <blahblahblahblah> is it really that simply
[23:35] <blahblahblahblah> *simple
[23:36] <Ben64> blahblahblahblah: pretty much, but you have a lot of upgrades to go
[23:36] <iceroot> caiotarifa: ubuntu is using upstart
[23:36] <daftykins> upgrade huh? you're brave
[23:36] <iceroot> !upstart | caiotarifa
[23:36] <ubottu> caiotarifa: Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[23:36] <mladoux> blahblahblahblah, sometimes there are issues, but usually it's pretty smooth
[23:36] <blahblahblahblah> my server is a web/db server with minimal components installed
[23:36] <blahblahblahblah> apache/mysql etc
[23:36] <kunji> daftykins: Upgrades haven't given me any issues yet, except once with the bootloader, just needed to reinstall grub
[23:37] <mladoux> blahblahblahblah, you'll most likely be fine unless you have some exotic hardware.
[23:37] <daftykins> good for you :)
[23:37] <kunji> I think it was the grub to grub 2 switch...
[23:37] <caiotarifa> iceroot: cool, I didn't know! :)
[23:37] <blahblahblahblah> it's a vps hosted with an isp
[23:37] <blahblahblahblah> so hopefully not
[23:37] <mladoux> blahblahblahblah, probably not anything to worry about, I'd still backup
[23:37] <iceroot> caiotarifa: it should already have a file to start/stop, it will be triggered via "sudo service servicename start/stop"
[23:38] <blahblahblahblah> the vps is running parallels and i have taken a manual backup using the gui
[23:38] <mladoux> vps hardware tends to be pretty standard stuff blahblahblahblah

[23:38] <Perf> Awh, someone unbanned me :)
[23:38] <Perf> how sweet
[23:38] <hexstatik> kunji: one more question how do i make a live iso from the current ubuntu install?
[23:39] <hexstatik> including all the programs etc
[23:39] <mladoux> blahblahblahblah, you'll probably upgrade with out issue, you may have to update your apache configs, or your mysql databases depending on how far back your upgrading from.
[23:39] <k1l_> blahblahblahblah: better check with the hoster support. sometime they have special kernels or stuff.
[23:39] <iceroot> hexstatik: just clone the harddrive with the partitions you are using on the system
[23:39] <caiotarifa> iceroot: native upstart comes in 12.04?
[23:39] <mladoux> also, you'll also want to make sure that your php scripts will work with php5, also, check your host for any kernel customizations.
[23:39] <cmj141> question, I downloaded and installed Eclipse. I also download a SDK for it but dont know where to put the SDK folders... is there a main folder for Eclipse that i extract these to?
[23:39] <paco1> ubottu: i want to configure TSIG on my DNS
[23:39] <ubottu> paco1: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[23:40] <iceroot> caiotarifa: 11.04 imo
[23:40] <rock-star1> ....
[23:40] <paco1> i want to configure TSIG on my DNS
[23:41] <kunji> hexstatik: Hmm, I have no idea, if you have a hard drive around you could use dd-rescue to make a bit for bit copy, I think there's a way to write that as an iso to a cd, but I don't think it would work like a livecd, anyone else have any ideas?
[23:41] <hexstatik> i have a bigger problem now
[23:41] <caiotarifa> iceroot: thanks… and there is a library of scripts? In this case, vsftpd 3.0.2?
[23:41] <rock-star1> hey can someone give dic of wpa ??
[23:41] <rock-star1> hey can someone give dic of wpa ??
[23:41] <hexstatik> as i was formattingh the SSD gparted gave an error
[23:41] <hexstatik> an now i cant see the ssd even in fdisk
[23:42] <rock-star1> hey can someone give dic of wpa ??
[23:42] <Ben64> hexstatik: check/replace the ssd cables
[23:42] <Ben64> rock-star1: no
[23:42] <iceroot> caiotarifa: every program will bring its own upstart script like the did for the old sys v init
[23:42] <mladoux> paco1 -- Is this what you're looking to do -- http://www.garron.me/go2linux/how-setup-dns-server-master-slave-bind.html
[23:43] <hexstatik> ben64: im gonna do that, but any other ideas before i do that?
[23:43] <Ben64> hexstatik: not really. i've seen a ton of cable problems though
[23:43] <caiotarifa> iceroot: Can you tell me if vsftpd already have? Or u don't know?
[23:43] <hexstatik> well that was my first reaction to check the cable
[23:44] <Ben64> even on my own system, read and write speed would be erratic, turns out it was the cable
[23:44] <hexstatik> r u talking about SSD cables parcticulary?
[23:44] <hexstatik> i c
[23:44] <Ben64> sata
[23:44] <iceroot> caiotarifa: i dont use ftp-servers but i bet vsftpd has also a upstart script
[23:44] <cmj141> question, I downloaded and installed Eclipse. I also download a SDK for it but dont know where to put the SDK folders... is there a main folder for Eclipse that i extract these to?
[23:44] <iceroot> caiotarifa: sudo service vs and then press TAB twice should show you the script
=== sridhar__ is now known as pwd1234
[23:45] <Ben64> iceroot: that doesn't work
[23:45] <iceroot> cmj141: maybe have a look at #eclipse
[23:45] <iceroot> Ben64: no?
[23:45] <Ben64> nope :(
[23:45] <Ben64> could do a "service --status-all"
[23:45] <paco1> mladoux: thanks but this page give only the basic dns config
[23:45] <caiotarifa> iceroot: cool, even not installed by aptitude?
[23:46] <iceroot> Ben64: sudo service tab tab  is showing all installed upstart services (12.04)
[23:46] <Ben64> iceroot: that just shows me items in the current directory (12.04)

[23:48] <caiotarifa> iceroot: (you can look my idea, it's for a open source project. https://github.com/formaweb/katchum)
[23:48] <mladoux> oh, nvm
[23:48] <paco1> mladoux: thanks, config TSIG in ubuntu in plus ;)
[23:48] <mladoux> that's just a preview
[23:49] <iceroot> caiotarifa: sounds nice, just a question, why do "you" want the latest version of php and mysql instead of the versions which are coming with the repos and are getting a security review and security fixes
[23:49] <mladoux> paco1 I think this might be a better reference --> http://goodsarves.blogspot.com/2010/08/configure-tsig-between-dns-master-and.html
[23:49] <KxTwo> hey guys.  I wanted to try out some other desktops so I downloaded gnome and xfce.  I decided to stick with unity so I want to get rid of the other desktops and remove them from the log in options.  I was able to find gnome in the installed list and uninstalled it but its still there as an option at login?
[23:50] <mladoux> paco1 wish I knew more about it.
[23:50] <mladoux> anyway, good luck
[23:50] <kunji> The SSD issue could be related to the Bios couldn't it?  It would just be a shot in the dark, but maybe check that your bios is up to date.
[23:50] <iceroot> KxTwo: uninstalling gnome is a bad idea when you still want to use unity, because unity is gnome3 with a different user-interface (shell)
[23:51] <jrib> KxTwo: dpkg -S /usr/share/xsessions/FILL_THIS_PART_IN
[23:51] <KxTwo> well im running unity right now?
[23:51] <KxTwo> not sure what I uninstalled since I can also still login with gnome
=== dj is now known as Guest4783
[23:52] <kunji> You probably uninstalled a metapackage, I think uninstalling them will only uninstall the metapackage itself, but installing will pull down all the packages the metapackage specifies.
[23:53] <KxTwo> so anything I need to fix?
[23:53] <kunji> Not really
[23:53] <jrib> KxTwo: is anything broken?  What did you remove exactly?
[23:53] <caiotarifa> iceroot: In the future my idea is that this installer works for any distribution… You don't recommend installing the latest stable version?
[23:53] <KxTwo> ok im looking at my history
[23:54] <kunji> There's a command to see your command history... but I forget what it is
[23:54] <jrib> kunji: history :)
[23:54] <KxTwo> ok im just going to paste this hold on
[23:54] <kunji> jrib: lol, thanks
[23:54] <iceroot> caiotarifa: no
[23:54] <caiotarifa> iceroot: why? which version should I look?
[23:54] <iceroot> caiotarifa: because on webservers you want software which is really stable and long tested and not the newest version of a software
[23:55] <iceroot> caiotarifa: specially such insecure things like php
[23:55] <iceroot> caiotarifa: so normally you want the debian way, old but very stable and long time tested software like apache2, php5 and so on
[23:56] <KxTwo> ok guys here you go, these are the things that apparently uninstalled when I did it, looks like I did it wrong.
[23:56] <KxTwo> http://snag.gy/hJQty.jpg
[23:56] <iceroot> caiotarifa: but if there a cases you need the newest version because you need new features ir something like that, then your script is nice but on most webservers you want ultra stable software
[23:57] <iceroot> KxTwo: gnome-shell is what people call "gnome3" that can be removed if you dont want the real gnome3 interface anymore
[23:57] <toordog> the documentation of ubuntu ldap is really bad
[23:57] <KxTwo> iceroot, So that is what I installed when I instaleld gnome?  But if I uninstalled it why can I still log in with the gnome options?
[23:58] <iceroot> KxTwo: without gnome-shell you should not be able to log in a real gnome3 session
[23:58] <iceroot> KxTwo: you can still log in in unity, gnome fallback and so on but not the real gnome3
[23:59] <iceroot> !gnome-shell
[23:59] <iceroot> !gnome3
[23:59] <ubottu> GNOME 3 is the desktop environment on which Unity is based.  To use GNOME Shell instead of Unity, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool". GNOME 3 is not supported under Natty/11.04, and may break your system if installed from alternate sources.
[23:59] <bentinata> !gnome-shell
[23:59] <KxTwo> iceroot, yah that was my original intention BUT I can still log in.  I wanted to try other Desktiops so downloaded a few.  I realized Ive grown to like unity so switched back and now cant get rid of the others.  Its not a big deal but I dont like the xubuntu screen.
[23:59] <bentinata> !gnome3
[23:59] <caiotarifa> iceroot: So… I'll install everything with aptitude to get the latest version?
[23:59] <kunji> Well, like I was saying, I can't say for sure off the top of my head, but I think they're meta packages and to actually remove gnome-shell you need to look at all the packages it installs and remove them each on their own.
