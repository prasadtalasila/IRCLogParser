[08:42] <fullmoon> good morning, afternoon, evening i kinda got a problem which i didn't had in ubuntu studio 10.04. Now I'm using 12.04 64bit. Problem is i can't move any folders?? why cant i move folders from my desktop to other folders??>>>error: File ol folder does not exsist<<<
[08:45] <philipballew> fullmoon, can you just cp it in the shell?
[08:46] <fullmoon> no
[08:46] <philipballew> does ls show it?
[08:46] <fullmoon> says same file or folder not existant
[08:46] <fullmoon> i tested it with new created folder(empty one) and still didnt work
[08:46] <philipballew> so then its not there right?
[08:46] <fullmoon> in list it shows it
[08:47] <philipballew> in Nautilus or whatever file manager our running?
[08:48] <philipballew> studio is xfce now iirc
[08:48] <fullmoon> xfce dekstop
[08:49] <philipballew> yeah!
[08:50]  * philipballew wonders if this is a bug or not
[08:50] <fullmoon> dunno in 10.04 didnt had this problem
[08:50] <fullmoon> but switched to new version since its also LTS
[08:51] <fullmoon> tried moving with sudo comannd no luck either
[08:51] <Unit193> Did you use proper case and escape spaces, etc?
[08:52] <fullmoon> i think so used online tutorial from YT path corected and such
[08:52] <fullmoon> tried diffrent spacing etc
[08:52] <fullmoon> still no luck
[08:53] <Unit193> Can you give the exact file name and command tried?

[08:54] <fullmoon> ok fixed it when you mentioned space i deleted space in folder name and works
[08:54] <fullmoon> its strange tho that it doesnt allow move folders with spaces in their names
[08:55] <Unit193> You can, it's just rather than using  file folder  you use either "file folder" or  file\ folder.
[08:55] <Unit193> Hence why I asked if you escaped them.
[08:55] <fullmoon> ye just noticed it in dir i never put \ before space but seems ubuntu does put it automaticly
[08:56] <fullmoon> ye gave me thinking hehe
[08:56] <Unit193> If you use tab complete. :)
[08:56] <fullmoon> thnks Unit193 and phill
[08:56] <Unit193> Sure.
[08:56] <fullmoon> but why didnt i had this problem in 10.04??
[08:57] <fullmoon> just wondering about that
[12:53] <nlsthzn> o/ all I need assistance setting up dual monitors, one running of discreet gfx (Radeon) and the other screen running of onboard Intel
[12:54] <nlsthzn> the screen on the radeon card working well, the intel card not.  It only works when I go to a tty and then the Radeon goes blank
[12:55] <nlsthzn> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2087963 for some info
[12:55] <nlsthzn> or is this better asked in #ubuntu?
[14:32] <kg> hi, pre-apology for a wordy question but i am new to ubuntu and somewhat new to linux fs. i've downloaded source for unity, i've built it using pbuilder, so now i have a package to install...but haven't yet installed for fear of the unknown - i am trying to understand as a developer what happens when using dpkg install to the package that are already there? for instance, let's say i modify some code build - but ooops, i was wron
[14:49] <raub> kg: AFAIK, you can reinstall the "factory" package over yours
[14:51] <kg> thanks - so if i screw something up, just pull from the ppa and reinstall?
[14:51] <raub> That's what I would do
[14:52] <raub> You can always force it
[14:55] <kg> thanks, i'll go with it if thats the convention (  i came from a symbian background where we would have loads of lib versions laying around to swap)
[17:16] <yeehi> Updated firmware for a SSD is v important. Will Ubuntu Quantal do this automatically, after installation? Samsung 840 pro
[18:32] <escott> yeehi, almost surely not going to be done automatically
[21:28] <guest-jdEQeq> i need help getting something done after installing ubuntu 12.04 LTS for the first time.
[21:29] <guest-jdEQeq> i can login as guest but my admin account that i created during the install no longer works.
