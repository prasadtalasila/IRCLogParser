[01:53] <shakes808> good evening
[01:54] <rick_h_> party
[01:59] <shakes808> how are your aneurysms?
[02:01] <shakes808> :D
[02:02] <rick_h_> subdued
[03:15] <widox> Blazeix: thanks!
[03:16] <widox> whoops. laggy history scrolling :-/
[03:28] <snap-l> Evening
[03:28] <snap-l> What's up?
[03:51] <shakes808> just getting git on my desktop
[03:51] <shakes808> what about yourself?
[03:59] <greg-g> sudo apt-get install git
[04:03] <snap-l> Wishing for someone to log into a site to accept my trade proposal. ;)
[04:03]  * snap-l is a hoss trader when it comes to board games. ;)
[04:04] <shakes808> greg-g: windows
[04:04] <shakes808> snap-l: what are you trading and where?
[04:05] <shakes808> just going through to get the README file up and I am getting an error trying to commit.
[04:07] <shakes808> asking if I ran an update command on the server lol.... I am not admin server network guy at github
[04:07] <shakes808> so nope
[04:07] <shakes808> lol
[04:10] <greg-g> shakes808: I'd follow the help docs on github rather than what is from git
[04:10] <greg-g> especially if you're just going to start out with github, you can learn real git usage later
[04:10] <greg-g> (github is git, yes yes, but, somethings seemed odd to me)
[04:11] <snap-l> board game geek,
[04:11] <snap-l> http://boardgamegeek.com/user/craigm
[04:12] <greg-g> holy cow
[04:12] <greg-g> and with that, goodnight
[04:13] <snap-l> ?
[04:13] <shakes808> i am going through github to do this
[04:14] <shakes808> it doesn't like my login/pass combo even through their GUI
[04:16] <shakes808> snap-l: that is a lot of Munchkins lol
[04:34] <shakes808> good night all
[14:40] <rick_h_> morning and all that
[14:40] <rick_h_> TGIF!!
[14:40] <rick_h_> short week or not
[15:18] <snap-l> yeah, no kidding
[15:30] <snap-l> Cat fell off the back of the chair, and caught her claw in my back.
[15:30] <rick_h_> yummy
[15:31] <snap-l> Yeah, not good
[15:32] <jrwren> why would you keep something around that can do that?
[15:34] <snap-l> Why would you keep around a child that can kill you in your sleep?
[15:35] <snap-l> I'm sure the number of deaths by domestic felines is lower than deaths by raging children
[15:35] <snap-l> unless you consider tripping
[15:35] <rick_h_> #toosoon
[15:35] <snap-l> at which point, they're probably equal. ;)
[15:36] <jrwren> #toosoon?
[15:36] <jrwren> i must have missed something.
[15:36] <rick_h_> child killing parent (MA shooting)
[15:36] <jrwren> when was this?
[15:37] <snap-l> Moments before he shot up that school
[15:37] <jrwren> oh.
[15:37] <rick_h_> you know, the big school shooting? all over the news? The first thing he did was shoot his mother
[15:37] <jrwren> that was a grown man
[15:37] <jrwren> not some child kept around
[15:37] <rick_h_> meh, 21 is grown man my #@$@
[15:37] <snap-l> and technically still a child. ;)
[15:37] <snap-l> I'm still a child of my parents. :)
[15:37] <rick_h_> sorry, first thing I thought of with snap-l's comment
[15:37] <jrwren> 13+ is a grown man in many cultures and religeons.
[15:37] <jrwren> if we didn't coddle our populous, ours could be too
[15:38] <snap-l> I'm wondering if 40+ is a grown man in some cases. ;)
[15:38] <jrwren> instead we have the "prolonged adolecense of the adult male"
[15:38] <rick_h_> jrwren: and 14yr olds can be mothers...doesn't mean it works great
[15:38] <jrwren> stupid people everywhere
[15:38] <_stink_> we have two cats, and i still can't figure out why we have them
[15:38] <snap-l> jrwren: I resemble that remark. ;)
[15:39] <_stink_> now i know why my parents never let us have pets when i was a kid.
[16:38] <brousch> greg-g: I forget. Are you working for Creative commons or Wikimedia now?
[16:38] <rick_h_> CC
[16:42] <brousch> thanks
[18:25] <jrwren> til: from itertools import izip,count
[18:25] <jrwren> >>> for (line,num) in izip(f,count(1)):
[18:26] <jrwren> line numbers are important for error messages when parsing a file :p
[19:28] <lmorchard> Huh, that's nifty
[21:07] <snap-l> jcastro: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaAkWy55V3A
[21:08] <snap-l> (and any other guitar freaks)
[21:08] <snap-l> I do like the top comment: The Kirk Hammet bit is invalid: no wah pedal.
[21:08] <jcastro> the eddie one is spot on
[21:08] <snap-l> Mustaine is spot on as well
[21:08] <jcastro> lol @ satriani too
[21:09] <snap-l> Yeah, Satriani and Vai's were funny.
[21:09] <jcastro> dimebag could have been better
[21:10] <snap-l> Yeah, that one didn't strike me nearly as much as Vai or Satch
[21:10] <jcastro> link bacon up in the community channel pls
[21:11] <jcastro> lol @ mustaine
[21:13] <snap-l> God, Vim can be such a pain sometimes.
[21:14] <snap-l> g/something//d doesn't work, but g/something/d does. Bastard. ;)
[21:14] <jcastro> oh dude
[21:14] <jcastro> he's going to explain every one
[21:14] <snap-l> Yeah, I didn't stick around for those.
[21:14] <jcastro> I AM
[21:15] <snap-l> I'm a dumb drummer. ;)
[21:25] <n0p> hey, i see edits in that
[21:25] <n0p> and different guitars
[21:26] <n0p> still pretty cool, but the title is not true "30 Shredders In One Solo"
[21:27] <snap-l> pedantic. ;)
[21:30] <n0p> i'm just totes jelly
[22:11] <Blazeix> widox: you thinking about going to the wednesday github drinkup?
[22:11] <Blazeix> i'm going to try to make it
