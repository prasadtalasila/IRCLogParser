[01:04] <SpamapS> rhagu: just make it 'runlevel 2'
[01:05] <SpamapS> rhagu: and make sure your bond0 is listed in /etc/network/interfaces as 'auto bond0'
[01:05] <SpamapS> rhagu: the system will not boot up until bond0 is up as long as it is listed there
[01:17] <rhagu> SpamapS this is what /etc/network/interfaces looks like, bond0 is brought up and gets an IP from the dhcp server
[01:18] <SpamapS> rhagu: good, then just change mediatomb to 'start on runlevel 2'
[01:19] <rhagu> I will try that, but shouldnt it work the other way, too?
[01:22] <rhagu> does it need to look like this: "start on runlevel [2345]"?
[01:23] <SpamapS> no
[01:23] <SpamapS> err
[01:23] <SpamapS> yes it can look like that
[01:23] <SpamapS> but you don't need the [2345] if you don't use runlevels 3, 4, or 5
[01:23] <SpamapS> thats just a distro level thing for the very tiny number of people who use runlevels for things
[01:26] <rhagu> I dont know if I use them but it wont hurt if I write it with brackets and the other numbers, right?
