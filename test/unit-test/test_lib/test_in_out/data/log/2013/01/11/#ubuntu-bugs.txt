[00:38] <bkerensa> bdmurray: Is #1073114 a valid bug?
[00:39] <bkerensa> Bug #1073114
[00:39] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1073114 in unity-lens-shopping (Ubuntu Raring) "Shopping Lens Does Not Respect User Privacy" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1073114
[01:08] <phillw> bdmurray: when ever you pick this one up, ref bug 971918 I can'y immediately see the 'verification required' tag. (I'm looking at the instructions now), but I can confirm that it works and have commented on the bug.

[01:16] <bdmurray> phillw: setting the quantal task to fix released is incorrect as the package is still in -proposed
[01:17] <bdmurray> phillw: additionally did you test in quantal or raring?
[01:17] <phillw> bdmurray: sorry :(
[01:17] <phillw> I'm using quantal, which is what the bug is raised against
[01:17] <bdmurray> phillw: okay, then if you verified it the correct thing to do is to change the tag from verification-needed to verification-done
[01:18] <phillw> bdmurray: where do I find that tag to alter?
[01:18] <bdmurray> phillw: then when the SRU team copies the package from -proposed to -updates the bug will be automatically set to fix released
[01:18] <bdmurray> phillw: in the bug tags? beneath the description and above related branches
[01:20] <phillw> that only lists precise?
[01:21] <phillw> Qauntal was the bug I knew of and the one I've followed. I'm quite happy to fire up a precise VM and test it in that.
[01:25] <bdmurray> the precise tag is not necessarily related to the verification-needed tag
[01:25] <bdmurray> they are 2 separate tags
[01:31] <phillw> bdmurray: is it just me being intensely dense (likely) or is it when I click on the 'verification needed' bit, I get a whole new window open asking me to tell it what bugs I'm asking about?
[01:31] <phillw> and when I put in the bug number it takes me back to original screen... :(
[01:36] <bdmurray> clicking on the tag performs a search for bugs with that tag
[01:36] <bdmurray> to edit the tags you want to click the pencil at the end of the list
[01:38] <phillw> bdmurray: is that correct?
[01:39] <phillw> because that reads to me that precise has been verified as okay, with no mention of quantal what so ever.....
[01:40] <phillw> I've never seen multiple tags against a bug - which is what is throwing me.
[01:41] <phillw> patch precise verification-done
[01:42] <bdmurray> the tags aren't necessarily related to each other
[01:43] <bdmurray> each tag is like a separate adjective describing the bug
[01:49] <phillw> bdmurray: now I understand, thanks to you.. May the Lord have mercy upon a new person. I've not had issues in the past.  I'll ask Gema to mention it when she does https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Testing/Activities/Classroom#Section_2

[19:58] <TheLordOfTime> bdmurray, ping, this isn't a bug right?  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1098697
[19:58] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1098697 in linux (Ubuntu) "High Battery discharge rate when Laptop is off." [Undecided,Confirmed]
[19:58] <TheLordOfTime> if the laptop's off, can linux be affecting the discharge rate?
[19:58] <TheLordOfTime> pretty certain it cant if i understand modern laptop architecture.
[20:02] <bdmurray> I wouldn't think so but would check with jsalisbury
[20:03] <TheLordOfTime> whom you just pinged here :P
[20:03] <jsalisbury> TheLordOfTime, I would also not think so, if the laptop was powered off
[20:04] <TheLordOfTime> which is what my systems hardware training suggested
[20:07] <TheLordOfTime> should I be converting that to a support question?
[20:07] <TheLordOfTime> although, tbh, the answer to eh suypport question is "Contact HP"
[20:07] <bdmurray> well maybe they mean suspend?
[20:09] <TheLordOfTime> perhaps
[20:09] <TheLordOfTime> i'm going to ask them, and Incomplete the bug
[20:09] <TheLordOfTime> if they say "No, I mean powered off state" then its notabug given our knowledge of typical laptop architecture and design.
[20:11] <jsalisbury> TheLordOfTime, Maybe shutdown laptop, then pull the battery and re-insert it.  That way you know the OS isn't in some sort of suspend or hibernated state.  If the battery drain stops, then it may be a kernel issu
[20:11] <jsalisbury> s/issu/issue/
[20:11] <TheLordOfTime> jsalisbury, i'd like to see whether its a case of suspend being used
[20:11] <TheLordOfTime> if it isn't then that should be the next question
[20:11] <TheLordOfTime> s/question/test/
[20:13] <TheLordOfTime> jsalisbury, i'm aware of a powered-on state link between the linux kernel/system and power drain, that one i'm fully aware of, but i've *never* heard of any kernel, Windows, Linux, or otherwise, impacting battery drain in a fully powered off state.
[20:15] <jsalisbury> TheLordOfTime, I agree.  It could be that the battery is going bad, or some sort of hardware short.
[20:15] <TheLordOfTime> i agree with that too
[20:15] <TheLordOfTime> because i've seen battery death :p
[20:15] <TheLordOfTime> heck, it happened to me about two months ago
[20:16] <jsalisbury> TheLordOfTime, sounds like a bad batch of batteries maybe?
[20:16] <TheLordOfTime> jsalisbury, well, that battery was 3 years olsd
[20:16] <TheLordOfTime> old *
[20:16] <TheLordOfTime> this system here, which is still my primary, is almost 4 years old.
[20:17] <jsalisbury> TheLordOfTime, maybe let the batter sit for two days out of the laptop and see if it drains.  If it doesn't, that could indicate a short in the laptop
[20:17] <TheLordOfTime> mhm
[20:17] <TheLordOfTime> jsalisbury, you may want to suggest that as possible tests of the battery, ASSUMING they're not suspending their system.

[20:21] <TheLordOfTime> ... that's a tag i've not seen before...
[20:21] <TheLordOfTime> kernel-da-key <-- that
[20:22] <jsalisbury> TheLordOfTime, Yeah, I use that for my reports to keep track of specific bugs that aren't related to the development kernel.
[20:22] <TheLordOfTime> ah.  i see.

[22:33] <TheLordOfTime> perhaps this is HP-specific in their architecture, and not something that is fixable in Linux?
