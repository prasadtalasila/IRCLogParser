[10:55] <rvba> jam: mgz Hey guys, would you mind having a look at bug #1100091 ?
[10:55] <ubot5> bug 1100091 in MAAS 1.2 "Kernel opts tagging feature missing completely" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1100091
[11:19] <mgz> rvba: indeed, we were putting it on 1.2 but you guys were trying to do a release from that so we took it off
[11:20] <mgz> if it's now wanted in a 1.2 release, it will need backporting
[11:22] <rvba> mgz: Thanks for having a look.  What's weird is that the support is partially implemented (the db migration to add the new field is there for instance).
[11:23] <rvba> mgz: I guess we need to clarify if it's a 1.2 or not.
[11:24] <mgz> the db migration stuff is there because migrations only work in a linear fashion
[11:24] <mgz> so, you can't backport one db change, but not the parts previous to it, without messing stuff up
[11:24] <rvba> Right
[11:39] <jam> mgz, rvba: last word I heard was that bigjools didn't want it to land in 1.2 at all.
[11:41] <rvba> jam: well, Julian is the one who asked me to have a look at that bug.  I added a comment on it; I guess we will see what he has to say about it.
[11:41] <rvba> mgz, jam thanks for your input guys.
[15:05] <rvba> roaksoax: Hi Andres, do you manage to get nodes enlisted in your environment?  Because we're having trouble doing this in the lab and we're wondering if there isn't a problem with the ephemeral images…
[15:07] <roaksoax> rvba: howdy!! yeah im enlisting just fine. is this precise you are using?
[15:08] <rvba> roaksoax: yes
[15:08] <rvba> roaksoax: the nodes end up with an empty /etc/resolve.conf and the cannot do much.
[15:09] <roaksoax> rvba: is there a screenshot of the failure?
[15:10] <rvba> roaksoax: not really, but I can send you a log file if you want.
[15:10] <roaksoax> rvba: adam_g reported yesterday a failure after a cloud-init update
[15:10] <roaksoax> so might be related
[15:10] <roaksoax> smoser: ^^
[15:12] <smoser> ephemeral images have not changed.
[15:12] <smoser> and should not be affected  by cloud-init in -updates
[15:14] <roaksoax> smoser: whats the bug thst adam_g reported yesterday?
[15:14] <roaksoax> rvba: logs would be helpful
[15:18] <rvba> roaksoax: the failure itself is simple: in the logs, I see lots of "unable to resolve archive.ubuntu.com" and then the node gets enlisted with a stupid name because of bug #1081660.
[15:18] <ubot5> bug 1081660 in maas-enlist (Ubuntu) "If maas-enlist fails to reach a DNS server, the node will be named ";; connection timed out; no servers could be reached"" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1081660
[15:21] <roaksoax> rvba: check squid-deb-proxy maybe?
[15:21] <rvba> Logs looks fine…
[15:21] <rvba> We're trying with an old ephemeral image…
[15:21] <rvba> Just to be sure smoser ;)
[15:21] <roaksoax> ack
[15:22] <smoser> rvba, ephemeral images have not been updated to my konwledge
[15:22] <smoser> shoot.
[15:23] <smoser> if you're using dailies, something could be wrong
[15:24] <rvba> Damnit, it worked
[15:27] <smoser> rvba, were you using dailies ?
[15:27] <rvba> We're using the daily images in the lab indeed.
[15:28] <smoser> yeah. ok. so there is work to fix there then. i'm not sure what :-(
[15:29] <rvba> The symptom was: the image was dhcp booting ok but ended up with an empty /etc/resolve.conf
[15:32] <smoser> rvba, are you easily able to test quantal daily ?
[15:32] <smoser> wait. not woth it.
[15:33] <rvba> all right
[15:34] <rvba> (but the answer would have been 'yes')
[16:46] <roaksoax> rvba: the kernel opts stuff was removed from 1.2?
[16:46] <roaksoax> rvba: as in the stuff that allows us to specify extra kernel opts?
[16:46] <roaksoax> with tags
[16:46] <roaksoax> jam: ^^
[16:47] <rvba> roaksoax: it was removed from 1.2 because Julian told jam the 1.2 was supposed to contain only bugfixes and no new features. Apparently…
[16:48] <roaksoax> -_-
[16:48] <roaksoax> -_-'
[16:48] <rvba> roaksoax: maybe we will revise that but we're waiting for Julian to decide :)
[16:48] <roaksoax> ack!
[16:49] <roaksoax> thanks for the info
[16:49] <rvba> (ツ)
[16:52] <bitwiz> does this error have anything to do with the error WARNING **: mirror does not support the specified release (precise)? I am also getting that error when a node pxe boots the inital install
[16:55] <bitwiz> the console log also show INFO: mirror does not have any suite symlinks. When i run the wget command on a virtual console one the node, i get a line for both Suite and Codename
[17:04] <roaksoax> smoser: so simply said, the fastpath installer is different kernel opts with different user-data right?
[17:04] <smoser> are there different kernel opts ?
[17:05] <smoser> wait.
[17:05] <smoser> ok. so what it is ...
[17:05] <roaksoax> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~smoser/+junk/xinstall.maas/view/head:/maas.changes.diff
[17:07] <smoser> roaksoax, it is possible that i could have changed that else on line 51 btter
[17:09] <smoser> roaksoax, yea... so really the only additional prameter to the ephemeral environment is 'ds=nocloud-net
[17:09] <smoser> '
[17:09] <roaksoax> smoser: ack
[17:09] <smoser> which convinces cloud-init it should just use the stuff from cloud-config-url= and not expect a datasource.
[17:10] <roaksoax> smoser: so in this case cloud-config-url is the contents of the /etc/maas/FAST-PATH-INSTALLER file
[17:10] <smoser> no.
[17:10] <smoser> that is an empty file. that just indicates if it should be taken or not
[17:11] <smoser> the payload is in 'preseed_fastpath' (see first hunk)
[17:11] <smoser> htat file is wrtten by the command listed in http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~smoser/+junk/xinstall.maas/view/head:/README.maas
[17:12] <smoser> we might be able to get rid of the different kernel param
[17:13] <smoser> and that is probably the correct fix.
[17:13] <smoser> as it maas's life much simpler.
[17:14] <roaksoax> yeah i'm just trying to visualize how to do this
[17:15] <roaksoax> rvba: so we have an issue, maas doesn't support raring
[17:17] <roaksoax> rvba: and it doesn't really makes sense to hardcode stuff
[17:24] <smoser> "maas doesn't support raring"
[17:24] <smoser> a.) that needs to be fixed
[17:24] <smoser> b.) why does that matter here
[17:24] <smoser> c.) what does that mean (doesnt support installing?)
[17:24] <roaksoax> smoser: yeah
[17:24] <roaksoax> smoser: raring is not a 'supported' release within MAAS
[17:25] <roaksoax> smoser: since it is being hardcoded
[17:25] <roaksoax> it was automatically detected before but was decided to not use that and hardcode it for the time being
[17:39] <roaksoax> smoser: we will not be using this right? # this line just says to use a different url (with -root.tar.gz)
[17:43] <smoser> roaksoax, well, the end goal is that we'll be using a -root.tar.gz to install from.
[17:43] <smoser> but we only have available on maas.ubuntu.com/images partition images.
[17:44] <smoser> elsehwere in that doc README.maas it explains it (see line 55)
[17:47] <roaksoax> smoser: ok, so we need 1. create the -root images (i'm guessing with maas-import-pxe-files)
[17:47] <roaksoax> 2. create /usr/share/maas/preseeds/preseed_fastpath on the fly
[17:47] <roaksoax> 3. have a tag that tells a system to fastpath
[17:48] <roaksoax> 4. have a tag that tells a system extra user-data
[17:48] <roaksoax> to be integrated with 2
[17:50] <smoser> 1 should happen on the server side. tthe client should not need to create those. although it is sufficiently easy, so maybe that makes sense. it does require root though :-(, so maybe not.
[17:50] <smoser> anyway. .. .one way or another we need to have -root.tar.gz files availble for the installer to get at.
[17:51] <smoser> i might generalize 3 and 4 into one thing from maas perspective.
[17:51] <smoser> basically:
[17:52] <roaksoax> smoser: yeah i already have the tags stuff
[17:52] <roaksoax> (r partially)
[17:52] <smoser>  if a node has a tag (through inheritance or directly) named 'install_preseed', then use that preseed.
[17:52] <roaksoax> smoser: the -root needs to be created on server side once maas-import-pxe-files is invoked though
[17:52] <smoser> this can probably be done in the existing preseed manner.
[17:53] <smoser> ideally, maas's knowledge of "fast path" should come down to
[17:53] <roaksoax> smoser: i'f the tag is fastpath=True, then I tell that the purpose is fastpath (which could be 'commissioning', or 'install')
[17:53] <smoser> a.) allow tag data to affect preseed data
[17:53] <smoser> b.) boot ephemeral image as the installer
[17:54] <smoser> c.) (if we have to) allow tag data "fastpath_install_kernel_opts='ds=nocloud'" to affect kernel options to 'b'
[17:54] <smoser> that make sense ?
[17:54] <smoser> then maas really is completely unaware of "fastpath"
[17:55] <roaksoax> smoser: yeah
[18:04] <roaksoax> smoser: this is what I was thinking: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1542176/
[18:06] <smoser> done use the string fast path
[18:07] <smoser> and decouple "preseed_input" from "should_install_use_ephemeral_environment"
[18:08] <roaksoax> smoser: so tag would be ephemeral_install
[18:08] <roaksoax> or similar
[18:08] <smoser> right.
[18:09] <smoser> and then... the preseed templates
[18:09] <smoser> when theyu're rendered, do they have access to the node ? and its tags ?
[18:10] <smoser> carp. i thought tags had values. that sucks.
[18:10] <smoser> a tag as "kernel_opts"
[18:10] <smoser> :-(
[18:10] <roaksoax> smoser: they should yes
[18:11] <smoser> no. i'm saying tags do not have values. its not key-value.
[18:11] <smoser> its just key.
[18:11] <smoser> which sucks.
[18:11] <smoser> and its limited to 256 chars
[18:11] <smoser> which also sucks
[18:12] <smoser> you'll have to ask the maas devs about this. i dont udnerstand it really.
[18:12] <roaksoax> yeah
[18:13] <smoser> oh.. ok. re-using the kenelopts stuff. we can just override that. here..
[18:13] <smoser> we add maas awareness of one tag:
[18:13] <smoser>  installer_ephemeral_kernel_opts
[18:14] <smoser> if that is set, then it uses the 'kernel_opts' for that and uses the ephemeral environment for install
[18:14] <smoser> err... i guess you can cut the 'kernel_opts' part off the name
[18:14] <smoser> hten, to allow the user to atually put useful *DATA* into the preseed path, we will need to put another field in.
[18:14] <smoser> into the tags, but lets just call it "value" or something.
[18:15] <smoser> that make sense?
[18:15] <smoser> why oh why does a tag not have a value *and* be limited to 256 chars
[18:16] <roaksoax> smoser: right, that's similar to what I;m doing
[18:16] <smoser> heh. i guess we could just use tag names like:
[18:16] <smoser>  installer_opts=http://place.where.my.opts.are
[18:16] <smoser> i dont know.
[18:17] <roaksoax> uhmm
[18:18] <smoser> ha. funny.
[18:18] <smoser> we just overload 'comment' with data
[18:18] <smoser> base64 encoded data.
[18:19] <smoser> then, if the preseed templates have access the currently executing node's tags, we can base64 decode there.
[18:19] <roaksoax> yeah
[18:19] <roaksoax> that too
[18:20] <smoser> jtv, anyone here able to explain to me why a tag would be so limited value ?
[18:20] <smoser> roaksoax, the more long term fi for this would be to have maas know about some "installer_input" and actually handle that specifically
[18:21] <roaksoax> yeah
[18:21] <roaksoax> i guess i'll have to discuss this with the MAAS team
[18:21] <smoser> do you know if we can get at node's tags in the preseed?
[18:21] <roaksoax> smoser: if we add them to the context we can
[18:22] <smoser> they shoudl definitely be part of the context
[18:23] <roaksoax> yeah
[18:23] <roaksoax> so I'll first work on getting the boot stuff, kernel params, image, etc, working as expected
[18:23] <roaksoax> then will deal with the preseed that
[18:23] <roaksoax> preseed data
[18:33] <roaksoax> smoser: Hold on
[18:34] <roaksoax> smoser: so we can do this: maas-cli tag create --name=00-default-console --definition=true \ --kernel_opts=console=ttyS0
[18:34] <roaksoax> err
[18:34] <roaksoax> maas-cli tag create --name=ephemeral_install --definition=true  --ephemeral_install_data=XYZXYZXYZXYZ
[18:37] <roaksoax> mgz: ping
[18:43] <smoser> roaksoax, ephemeral_install_data ?
[18:44] <smoser> you're saying we'd have to add that.
[18:47] <roaksoax> smoser: so if I do this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1542262/, that means that we can define a tag with *any* name
[18:47] <smoser> definition is not that though. defnition describes the nodes that it applies to
[18:47] <roaksoax> smoser: right, forget about definition :)
[18:48] <roaksoax> so we owuld be adding another attribubte to the tag
[18:48] <smoser> overload comment
[18:48] <smoser> :)
[18:48] <roaksoax> so the tag would have a name, definition, and ephemeral_install_data attribute
[18:48] <roaksoax> and comment
[18:48] <smoser> oh wait. that might not work because tag is probably unique
[18:48] <smoser> maybe it is id ont now.
[18:49] <roaksoax> right so we can create a tag  name=ephemeral, comment='ephemeral install', definition='whatever', ephemeral_install_data='data to use at install time'
[18:49] <smoser> right. i get what you're saing. we could do that. but i'd say that it shouldn t be "ephemeral_install_data"
[18:49] <smoser> it should just be "value"
[18:51] <roaksoax> smoser: you mean this?: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1542272/
[18:51] <roaksoax> smoser: so the 'name' would *always* have to be say 'ephemeral_install' and we would have to check for that
[18:52] <smoser> tags dont work here i dont think.
[18:52] <smoser> 'name' is unique
[18:52] <roaksoax> smoser: so if someone defines: name='ephemeral_installer' value='blob' it wouldn't work
[18:52] <smoser> not unique per-node, but unique.
[18:52] <smoser> right.
[18:52] <roaksoax> so we would have to check for the name of the tag
[18:56] <roaksoax> smoser: now the problem is how to pass the user data
[18:56] <roaksoax> say we create a tag with --value=/path/to/filename we would need to modify the cli
[18:56] <roaksoax> to open the file, convert it in a base64 blob
[18:56] <roaksoax> etc etc
[19:00] <smoser> --value wont work
