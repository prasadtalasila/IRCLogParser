[02:18] <FloatingGoat> where has holstien been
[09:19] <multimedia> Good morning from Seville, i'am fun of Ubuntustudio, this is a 11.04, and have other pc with 12.04, two versions are nice, and i like comments. Thank's have a nice day in Ubuntu.
[09:56] <multimedia> I have a little problem with Ardour in Ubuntustudio 12.04, i don't save project, and export in .wav file have a problem with save, the file is corrupted or no sound in this track. Thank's
[13:46] <raven_> do you know about any (cmd-)tool that i able to do sound processing (with compressors) on a mp3-stream without external decoding?
[13:50] <cfhowlett> raven_: to what?
[13:51] <raven_> i have a webradio running on icecast and id like to do sound-processing on it without decoding it to "real audio"
[13:52] <cfhowlett> avconv is what you want, I think
[13:53] <raven_> cfhowlett, but it is not able to do sound compressing and eqing
[13:53] <cfhowlett> raven_: news to me.  I still use ffmpeg but the official notice is that it's been deprecated and to use avconv instead.
[13:54] <raven_> ffmpeg can do eqing??
[13:54] <cfhowlett> raven_: ffmpeg will compress to .mp3 and other formats.  eq'ing is not on the menuy though
[13:54] <raven_> right i mean sound-compressing not format-compressing
[13:54] <cfhowlett> raven_: awww, ok
[13:55] <cfhowlett> Not something I've done.  You might want to search the linux radio station/streaming options.
[13:56] <cfhowlett> raven_: quite a few options pop up on the first search page.
[13:56] <raven_> for example?
[13:57] <cfhowlett> gnormalize ..
[13:57] <cfhowlett> normalize-audio
[14:08] <Len-nb> cfhowlett, there are actually two projects, ffmpeg and libav. Libav is like a fork and they are slowly changing the commands to libav.

[21:49] <zlatko_> hello, is there any tutorial plainly explaining how to connect/get sound: guitar - line6ux1 (or any other external sound card) - jack - guitarix (or similar)?
[21:53] <zlatko_> btw. external sound card (line6) works perfectly on freshly installed Ubuntu Studio 12.10. On earlier *buntu versions it was really frustrating...
[22:04] <len-1304> zlatko_, I do not know of a tutorial... Though I don't have a good knowlage of what is available...
[22:04] <len-1304> Where are you having problems?
[22:06] <zlatko_> well first of all I don't quite understand Jack concept. In W$ I just plug the guitar and open standalone version of guitar effect software and I get the sound out...
[22:07] <len-1304> In linux you could do that sort of with pulse, but the sound out would be way behind you playing
[22:07] <len-1304> Jack is a replacment back end that can have way lower latency.
[22:08] <zlatko_> Then I read some Jack tutorials and figured out "connect" options in qJackCtl
[22:08] <len-1304> We are having problems getting Jack to start right now... but I have a workaround.
[22:08] <len-1304> It is not that hard. Just like a physical patch pannel.
[22:09] <zlatko_> But then there is a setup pannel where my sound card is listed in Interface and I/O drop down menues.
[22:10] <zlatko_> But no matter what I am doing I can't get sound out...
[22:10] <len-1304> Have you got the level turn up on it?
[22:11] <zlatko_> So I was thinking not to bother you guys, but simply to get some good tutorial. Couldn't find...
[22:11] <zlatko_> level turn up?
[22:12] <len-1304> Use either alsamixer from the terminal or the pulse mixer from the speaker icon at the top
[22:12] <len-1304> (sound settings)
[22:12] <len-1304> By default all the levels are off.
[22:12] <len-1304> (for capture ports.)
[22:13] <len-1304> zlatko_, I am assuming your audio Interface is USB?
[22:13] <zlatko_> Yes it is a USB interface and I was in pulseaudio setup
[22:13] <zlatko_> turned OFF my internal Intel card
[22:13] <len-1304> Good idea
[22:13] <zlatko_> so just USB device is active and everything is ON
[22:14] <zlatko_> Input, Output & Playback
[22:14] <len-1304> there is a tab called input devices
[22:14] <zlatko_> Recording window is blank...
[22:15] <len-1304> sounds like you got it. If jack is not running then when you put something into the input you should see a level in the meter.
[22:15] <zlatko_> I am following. Input Tab
[22:15] <len-1304> That is where the input level is set.
[22:15] <len-1304> There is a bar under that that should show input level like a meter.
[22:15] <zlatko_> Ok
[22:16] <len-1304> Before worrying about jack you want to see level there.
[22:17] <zlatko_> If I got youright: I should now strum my guitar and get meter jumping...
[22:17] <len-1304> right
[22:17] <zlatko_> no...  :-(
[22:17] <len-1304> Do you still have jack running?
[22:17] <len-1304> (with qjackctl?)
[22:18] <zlatko_> no I did not start it. qjackctl is opened, but not started still.
[22:19] <len-1304> Ok, in the input devices section for that card is there a green check mark?
[22:20] <zlatko_> Yes
[22:20] <len-1304> Is it depressed?
[22:20] <zlatko_> Depressed and channels locked together
[22:20] <len-1304> there is also just over from that a mute button
[22:20] <len-1304> make sure you are not muted.
[22:20] <zlatko_> it is not muted...
[22:21] <len-1304> Ok, I'm not sure, but I have to run and pick up my son from school, so I will be back in 20 min or so.
[22:22] <zlatko_> (playback is perfect on this USB card). len thanks. I am going to sleep now. I will continue tomorrow :)
[22:22] <zlatko_> Thanks a lot anyway ;-) kids first!
