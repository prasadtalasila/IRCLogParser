[16:18] <thafreak> Playing with freenas, I'm starting to finally understand freebsd better
[16:23] <paultag> :)
[17:27] <thafreak> so, freenas only has transmission available as a downloading plugin
[17:28] <thafreak> which only downloads torrents
[17:28] <thafreak> I got aria2 installed in the jail, and ran the daemon of it
[17:28] <thafreak> now I can send it commands via xmlrpc to have it download just about anything :)
[17:29] <thafreak> just need to figure out how to make a bsd rc.d script for it...
