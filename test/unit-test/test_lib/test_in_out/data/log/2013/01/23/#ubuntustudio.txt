[20:42] <FloatingGoat> what do you guys think of soundhole pickups for guitar?
[20:42] <zequence> FloatingGoat: Never heard of them, but try #opensourcemusicians. There are a few guitarists on that channel who know their stuff
[20:50] <faLUCE> hi, is there a way to move down the upperpanel?
[21:01] <len-1304> faLUCE, for any panel right click on it. Click on "Panel" then preferences.
[21:02] <len-1304> uncheck lock and you should be able to drag it around
[21:03] <len-1304> FloatingGoat, sound hole pickups are fine for stage work with a steel string guitar, they don't work for nylon.
[21:03] <len-1304> Get one that is designed for acoustic sound or it will sound electric.
[21:03] <faLUCE> len-1304: I can't drag it. I unchecked lock but I can't drag it
[21:03] <faLUCE> len-1304: sorry
[21:03] <faLUCE> thanks
[21:03] <len-1304> faLUCE, let me try.
[21:04] <faLUCE> len-1304: solved
[21:04] <faLUCE> thanks
[21:04] <len-1304> with the panel preferences panel open try using the mouse to grab the panel right at the end.
[21:04] <len-1304> faLUCE, ^^^
[21:04] <faLUCE> yes you were right thanks
[21:06] <len-1304> FloatingGoat, for recording, use a mic over _any_ pickup if you want an acoustic sound.
[21:10] <FloatingGoat> what do you think?
[21:11] <zequence> I agree on using a condenser mic when recording acoustic guitar. Can't beat that with any pickup
[21:11] <zequence> pickups are good for live use
[21:12] <FloatingGoat> i know for recordings. but what about realtime recordings
[21:12] <FloatingGoat> live recordings
[21:14] <FloatingGoat> cause i want to record guitar as well as
[21:14] <FloatingGoat> my voice at the same time
[21:15] <len-1304> FloatingGoat, for live stuff, the guitar will not sound as good no matter what you do, but a pickup will allow better feedback control and keep the mic for guitar and voice from comb filtering.
[21:16] <len-1304> Any time you have two mics close together, there will be comb filtering.
[21:16] <len-1304> It will make your recordings sound hollow.
[21:16] <zequence> FloatingGoat: Depends. I haven't done that type of recording much. Of course, the vocals will leak into the guitar mic quite a bit, if you sing and play.
[21:16] <len-1304> I think the sound hole pickup I have is a fishman
[21:16] <zequence> len-1304: Not if you do it right though
[21:17] <len-1304> On stage? Is there a right? :)
[21:18] <zequence> The vocals will leak not only into the mic picking up the guitar, but it will also resonate some in the guitar itself
[21:19] <zequence> One will only know how it all sounds by trying different setups
[21:19] <len-1304> The one thing you will notice with an in hole PU is that it does change the resonant frequency of the guitar body... generally lower.
[21:19] <len-1304> zequence, yes
[21:19] <len-1304> Best test is to record it and listen to the recording.
[21:21] <zequence> If it's a nice room, you could do a stereo recording. Two balanced cardoid condensers, close to each other, picking up opposite sides of the room.
[21:21] <zequence> The mics need to be good too
[21:22] <len-1304> nice room to a hall owner = lots of seats in a small space...
[21:23] <len-1304> Oh and still meats fire codes.
[21:23] <len-1304> *meets
[21:23]  * len-1304 is feeling cynical today.
[21:24] <zequence> Most concert halls seem to suffer from that problem :)
[21:24] <zequence> I find the best halls are fairly small
[21:25] <zequence> And you enjoy being there more, if it's much less than packed
[21:25] <len-1304> I have pretty much decided that the performer audience interaction is the most important thing.
[21:26] <len-1304> Getting good sound is important, but there has to be something worth seeing/listening to.
