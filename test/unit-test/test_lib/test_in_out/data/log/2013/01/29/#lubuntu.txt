[05:35] <thedoctar> does lubuntu have templates?
[05:36] <Unit193> What type?
[05:36] <mysteriousdarren> thedoctar: for what?
[05:38] <thedoctar> in pcmanfm, when you right click under the menu create new...
[05:38] <thedoctar> when I was using gnome, nautilus would have files located in ~/Templates in that menu
[05:43] <Unit193> http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Google_Summer_of_Code_2010#Add_Custom_File_Actions.2C_.22Send_to.22.2C_and_.22Create_New_Files.22_to_popup_menus_of_PCManFM.2FLibfm  I'd guess a no?
[05:45] <Unit193> Or http://www.mail-archive.com/pcmanfm-develop@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00471.html indicates it may be. :P
[05:46] <thedoctar> http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3397302&group_id=156956&atid=801867
[05:46] <thedoctar> it says here resolution:fixed for the feature request
[05:47] <thedoctar> but the templates thing doesn't work for me
[05:47] <thedoctar> I was wondering whether it was because the feature didn't exist or whether something is wrong with my computer
[05:50] <Unit193> I'd test it if I had one.
[05:51] <thedoctar> if you had what?
[05:59] <Unit193> themaster: I'd try asking in #lxde
[06:10] <thedoctar> okay

[13:33] <pmatulis> should i be trying to start stuff upon login by using ~/.config/openbox/autostart ?  tried it yesterday and nothing happened
[14:01] <xiaoy> How can i tell lubuntu not to hibernate, suspend or anyting like that, when i close the lid of my laptop?
[14:01] <xiaoy> Any help on this is kindly apreciated :)
[14:02] <xiaoy> i've found this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/15520/how-can-i-tell-ubuntu-to-do-nothing-when-i-close-my-laptop-lid
[14:02] <xiaoy> but it need gconf, is there a solution for lxde too?
[14:08] <xiaoy> oh... it seems i found myself the answer looking in the menu :P for power settings
[15:24] <Alessio> How do i change language of my Lubuntu installation? / or install language packs. The guide says Preferences->language support. but there is not a such voice in the menu
[15:39] <powermi> hi
[15:40] <mysteriousdaren> powermi: hi
[15:40] <powermi> need help installing LUBUNTO on a powerPC
[15:40] <powermi> how can i get help?
[15:40] <mysteriousdaren> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PowerPCDownloads/
[15:40] <mysteriousdaren> did you check this out?
[15:41] <powermi> yes
[15:41] <powermi> but cant find my problem
[15:41] <mysteriousdaren> what kind of help do you need? what are you having trouble doing?
[15:42] <powermi> just try to install Lubuntu 12.10 on powermac g4, and afeter booting in live cd and charge the status bar in the blue screen there is a fast message coming saying : Stopping sistem
[15:42] <powermi> and few works more, but its to quickly to read
[15:44] <mysteriousdaren> did you try the alternate install cd?
[15:44] <powermi> no, whats the diference?
[15:44] <powermi> now i am downloading it
[15:46] <mysteriousdaren> it just has a blue/white install base for users that can't run the regular live cd. I always just skip to using it, because as I've found a faster install ttime
[15:47] <powermi> so you preffer aternate install?
[15:47] <powermi> is easy for a noob too?
[15:47] <holstein> i would do 12.04
[15:48] <holstein> or older... ppc support will not be improving
[15:48] <powermi> 12.04 better than 12.10?
[15:48] <holstein> powermi: "better" is a matter of opinion.. you might find the ppc support better in 12.04, or 10.04
[15:49] <powermi> ill try alternate 12.04
[15:49] <powermi> lets see
[15:49] <powermi> thanks a lot
[15:49] <powermi> very helpfully
[15:49] <mysteriousdaren> I run alternate 12.04 on one netbook, and 12.10 on another
[15:49] <mysteriousdaren> both lubuntu
[15:50] <holstein> i like to try the live CD's.. i like to see the desktop first before installing
[15:50] <holstein> but the alternate iso's can be helpful too if you have issues
[15:51] <powermi> but its suppose that 12.10 shlould be better than the 04?
[15:51] <powermi> isnt it=
[15:51] <powermi> ?
[15:51] <holstein> powermi: "better" is a matter of opinion.. and hardware support
[15:51] <holstein> powermi: no.. nothing about 12.10 is "better"
[15:51] <holstein> the packages are newer... its newer.. its more recent
[15:52] <powermi> ok, i understand
[15:52] <holstein> powermi: if you need something from 12.10, you need to run 12.10.. otherwise, PPC support is going away... so you might have better luck with an earlier, arguably more supported release
[15:52] <powermi> fow a low end mac, do you recomend other linux distro?
[15:52] <holstein> powermi: actually, PPC support is not "going away".. its gone.. its not officially supported
[15:53] <holstein> powermi: i dont run X on mine
[15:53] <holstein> works great as a commandline only machine... a headless server
[15:53] <holstein> i recommend moving away from that hardware for a destkop ASAP
[15:54] <powermi> sorry but love my PPCs
[15:54] <holstein> especially these days when you can dig a comparable PC out of the trash
[15:54] <powermi> is a great arquitechture
[15:54] <holstein> powermi: you can, and most do... and they were great
[15:54] <holstein> powermi: again.. im not saying they are "bad"
[15:54] <holstein> powermi: im saying they are not supported
[15:55] <holstein> powermi: you will only have more and more trouble using them as desktop machines, and these days, you can dig comparable PC's out of the trash
[15:55] <holstein> ubuntuserver runs great on them
[15:56] <mysteriousdaren> powermi: what are the specs on your ppc?
[15:56] <holstein> G4
[15:56] <powermi> 773 mhz, 2 Gb RAM
[15:56] <powermi> lot os SATA disk and IDE
[15:57] <holstein> i have a stack of PC hardware comprarable to that that is going to the donation station
[15:58] <powermi> me too, have some PCs "better" than mi PPC
[15:58] <powermi> and give them away
[15:58] <holstein> i would choose a 12.04 LTS and try and get it up and running, and enjoy the EOL of that hardare.. or try running ubuntuser
[15:58] <powermi> thanks a lot mate
[15:58] <holstein> ppc support is not getting better.. it will only get worse
[15:59] <mysteriousdaren> i'd set up a headless server like our resident guru suggested, I recently set up a server with lubuntu 12.10 through an ubuntu server install dual core, 8gb ram. It depends on what works for you. I was told it was a piece of crap, but is rock solid
[16:02] <holstein> mysteriousdaren: i can still get a lot done on my dual core with 8 gigs of ram...
[16:03] <powermi> is a powerPC?
[16:03] <mysteriousdaren> no, but I recently installed lubuntu 12.10 on a ppc a few weeks ago, used the alternate install
[16:04] <powermi> ok tnaks
[16:05] <mysteriousdaren> hostein: what are you running in it?
[16:09] <powermi> just music a torrent server
[16:09] <powermi> and use it for backup
[16:10] <mysteriousdaren> powermi: you should be good to go
[16:11] <powermi> ?
[17:47] <vasilakisfil> how can I install (from cli) all packets that their name start with the same prefix, like packet0.10- ?
[17:47] <vasilakisfil> sudo apt-get install packet0.10-* does not work..
[17:49] <holstein> vasilakisfil: i dont see those in the repos.. did you add a PPA?
[17:49] <vasilakisfil> haha its just an example
[17:49] <vasilakisfil> actually I want gstreamer0.10-*
[17:51] <holstein> sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-* looks like its going to work for me.. whats the error?
[17:52] <vasilakisfil> ➜  ~  sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-.*
[17:52] <vasilakisfil> zsh: no matches found: gstreamer0.10-.*
[17:52] <vasilakisfil> oops sorry
[17:52] <vasilakisfil> anyway even without the dot I get the same error
[17:53] <holstein> vasilakisfil: do you have errors with sudo apt-get update ?
[17:53] <vasilakisfil> only gstreamer0.10-. worked for me
[17:53] <vasilakisfil> what errors should I have ?
[17:53] <holstein> vasilakisfil: none, ideally
[17:54] <vasilakisfil> Actually I don't have any error
[17:54] <holstein> vasilakisfil: im just trying to sort out why you are not able to use the wild card as i am
[17:54] <vasilakisfil> maybe due to zsh shell
[17:54] <vasilakisfil> you have bash I suppose ?
[17:54] <holstein> what did i do? i typed 'sudo apt-get install gstreamer', i hit the tab key... i used what was returned to create the wildcard i wanted
[17:55] <holstein> hyperair: i dont use zsh
[17:55] <hyperair> ?
[17:55] <wxl> vasilakisfil: some talk of wildcards includes zsh here http://www.linux-mag.com/id/1528/
[17:55] <holstein> hyperair: sorry... vasilakisfil ^^
[17:56] <wxl> i don't use zsh either
[17:56] <hyperair> my zsh is configured to refuse execution of the command when * is unexpanded.
[17:56] <hyperair> so when i really need to pass * in as an argument, i use \*
[17:57] <hyperair> perhaps that's what you need?
[17:58] <vasilakisfil> yeah \* works fine
[17:59] <vasilakisfil> oh and another thing
[18:00] <holstein> what are the chances i would accedentally ping hyperair for a relevant query :)
[18:00] <vasilakisfil> in lubuntu\s default imag viewer images are getting "chopped", is this a known bug ?
[18:00] <wxl> hah
[18:00] <holstein> vasilakisfil: chopped?
[18:00] <holstein> vasilakisfil: feel free and take a screenshot...
[18:00] <hyperair> holstein: :-)
[18:00] <vasilakisfil> yeah good idea
[18:02] <vasilakisfil> http://postimage.org/gallery/26gs2508/e49ca613/
[18:02] <wxl> weird
[18:02] <vasilakisfil> it happens 70% of the times
[18:02] <wxl> does that do that when not maximized?
[18:03] <vasilakisfil> well randomly but more often when I move forward to another image (or backwards)
[18:03] <wxl> so let me be clear on your answer: if the window is not maximized, does it do that at all?
[18:03] <vasilakisfil> I will install ubuntu's default image viewer to see what is happening there
[18:04] <vasilakisfil> it does it randomly which means even if it is not maximized or if I explicitely maximize the window
[18:05] <holstein> vasilakisfil: i can only say it doesnt do that for me
[18:05] <vasilakisfil> hehe
[18:05] <wxl> yeah i don't have that problem either
[18:05] <wxl> have you searched launchpad for a relevant bug?
[18:05] <holstein> vasilakisfil: i would try a few things... check for and apply upgrades... try as a different user (to remove your user config from the equation) try live CD's of whatever you might have sitting around.. try other graphics drivers
[18:06] <holstein> vasilakisfil: also, trying other image viewers as you suggeste
[18:08] <vasilakisfil> ok
[18:13] <vasilakisfil> only live usb remains to check
[18:14] <wxl> sounds like a new bug to fill
[18:14] <wxl> whether or not we have the problem, you do!
[18:14] <vasilakisfil> anyway, another image viewer is the only case in which images are shown properly
[18:16] <vasilakisfil> ok I will try live usb now..
[18:18] <Flazer> any idea why someone trying to boot to a live CD of lubuntu would get stuck on first loading screen - never makes it to installation/setup
[18:18] <Flazer> ?
[18:19] <holstein> Flazer: sure... hardware support
[18:19] <holstein> Flazer: i would try nomodeset and the apci options
[18:20] <bparticle> Hi! I'm trying to get my girlfriend's asus eee pc to be a little snappier with Lubuntu. Question: why is it slower from the hard drive than the live session?
[18:20] <rpatton> hello all
[18:20] <rpatton> anybody got any experience running lubuntu on a xSeries 235 Server
[18:21] <holstein> bparticle: configuration... the live was on USB and the install is on a spinning disc maybe..
[18:21] <bparticle> The live session is perfect, impressive really. And then I installed it, and nothing, absolutely nothing advanced... :(
[18:21] <bparticle> I know. is there any special way to handle the hard drive?
[18:21] <holstein> bparticle: you can install to usb. maybe the hard drive is bad
[18:22] <wxl> bparticle: that's got an actual hard drive and not an ssd?
[18:22] <bparticle> As that's the main difference I'm looking in that direction, but I'm hardly an expert
[18:22] <holstein> rpatton: should be just like running on any hardware...i would probably not run any X on a server, but you can, and LXDE would be a nice choice
[18:22] <bparticle> I don't know really... it's the eee pc 1201ha. I should check that
[18:22] <holstein> bparticle: i would just check for and apply upgrades. maybe just give it some time..
[18:23] <bparticle> a LOT of time, believe me! Not really an improvement to Windows 7; hehe
[18:23] <wxl> nope it's a hard drive
[18:23] <wxl> weird
[18:23] <wxl> sata, too. shouldn't be too slow.
[18:23] <holstein> bparticle: i use ubuntu's routinely on EEE's
[18:24] <wxl> ditto that ‡
[18:24] <wxl> oops
[18:24] <holstein> bparticle: i dont have any issues like you are reporting.. the constant is the hard drive
[18:24] <bparticle> I tried the 12.10, and I heard 12.04 is a little faster, so that's my next move
[18:24] <holstein> bparticle: you could install to usb and test
[18:24] <wxl> darn i forgot the unicode for uparrow :)
=== lubuntu is now known as vasilakisfil
[18:24] <vasilakisfil> hey in live distro its ok
[18:24] <holstein> bparticle: 12.10 and 12.04 are similar in speed
[18:24] <wxl> one question is this: how are you measuring its speed, bparticle ?
[18:24] <bparticle> damn
[18:24] <vasilakisfil> but I haven't updated it yet
[18:25] <holstein> bparticle: one could be noticably faster than the other depending on hardware support
[18:25] <wxl> 2gb of memory-- you should be blazing
[18:25] <bparticle> by waiting for the cursor to advance when I move the mouse
[18:25] <bparticle> it just sticks
[18:25] <wxl> bparticle: yikes
[18:25] <holstein> bparticle: what do i suggest? look for and apply upgrades... test the hard drive
[18:25] <holstein> bparticle: im on a comarable machine now.. and its not stickin.. and it doesnt stick when you are not using the hard drive
[18:25] <wxl> you should check resource usage. maybe you have something running and you don't realize it's hogging up resources.
[18:26] <holstein> comparable
[18:26] <wxl> i've run it on 512mb of memory and had no problems XD
[18:26] <holstein> nmon is a nice tool to see whats up.. i know my machine gets laggy due to the hard drive.. but not as bad as you report
[18:26] <rpatton> so what would u run on a server
[18:27] <bparticle> well, at least it all sounds hopefull
[18:27] <wxl> rpatton: what do you want to do with it? :)
[18:27] <holstein> rpatton: ubuntuserver... or minimal.. just not a desktop environment.. but LXDE is nice if you want/need X on a server
[18:28] <bparticle> I'm just restarting into 12.04, crossing my fingers
[18:28] <holstein> bparticle: i would just do a test.. should take an hour or so, then you'll know
[18:28] <rpatton> i dont know any cmds so i need the Graphical interface
[18:28] <holstein> rpatton: then, try lubuntu live, and see if it works for you
[18:29] <rpatton> trying that now
[18:29] <wxl> i'd say a lot of services that you'd use on a server only use terminal so you should probably learn the CLI…
[18:30] <holstein> yeah.. wont hurt to have LXDE running, but thats not what you'll be doing if you are indeed running a server
[18:30] <holstein> if you are using a server as a desktop machine, then go for it
[18:30] <rpatton> no live not working either
[18:30] <holstein> either way, lubuntu does what it does, and does it well
[18:31] <holstein> rpatton: you can try the same options i suggested above.. nomodeset, and the apci options
[18:31] <wxl> rpatton: what sort of machine are you using?
[18:31] <bparticle> @holstein how do I use nmon?
[18:32] <holstein> 19:20 < rpatton> anybody got any experience running lubuntu on a xSeries 235 Server
[18:32] <holstein> bparticle: i did 'sudo apt-get install nmon' then i typed 'nmon' and ran the monitor for what i wanted to monitor
[18:32] <wxl> man nmon ← :)
[18:33] <wxl> rpatton: what exactly is happening that it's not working?
[18:33] <holstein> if its a blank screen its likely some graphics driver issue that 'nomodeset' would work out
[18:34] <bparticle> @holstein: ok, and are there particular figures I am interested in? Or something that I can report back here, or on the forum?
[18:34] <wxl> i can't tell what the gpu is on that thing
[18:34] <wxl> bparticle: look at maybe cpu and memory usage and if anything is using a major portion of it
[18:34] <holstein> bparticle: i should think you are interested in wht figures relating to "why is my girlfriends computer running slow"
[18:35] <bparticle> great, that gets me on the way :)
[18:35] <holstein> bparticle: i think its fair to start with the hard drive, since the live CD is not using the hard drive, and i have literally 4 of those machines with no such issues
[18:35] <bparticle> but I must say, so far 12.04 looks far snappier than 12.10!
[18:35] <holstein> bparticle: from usb?
[18:35] <bparticle> no, hard drive
[18:36] <holstein> bparticle: could be a driver related to that hardware from 12.10 i suppose
[18:36] <holstein> i dont run 12.10 on anything other than for testing here and there
[18:36] <bparticle> of course then I still have to fix the video thing. I had to restart lightdm
[18:36] <holstein> what "video thing"?
[18:37] <bparticle> ehm. the gma500 thing
[18:37] <bparticle> started with a black screen
[18:37] <Doc_exe> i believe the technical term is thingy
[18:37] <bparticle> exactly
[18:37] <wxl> !thingy
[18:37] <wxl> 1037 [ubottu(ubottu@ubuntu/bot/ubottu)] Sorry, I don't know anything about thingy
[18:38] <Doc_exe> :)
[18:38] <rpatton> hello
[18:38] <bparticle> poulsbo driver, this netbook has a history of bad suport for its video hardware
[18:39] <wxl> ew
[18:39] <bparticle> another unrelated question. I want to use cairo dock and it's asking me if I want to enable openGl. What is the best option performance wise?
[18:41] <Flazer> hey patton
[18:41] <wxl> bparticle: http://www.sv.vt.edu/classes/ESM4714/Student_Proj/class00/hunter/V.A.html
[18:41] <bparticle> I'm not interested in exploding moving around icons with lots of whistles and bells, just want a nice launcher and dock, minimal but stylish
[18:41] <Flazer> <wxl> rpatton: what exactly is happening that it's not working?
[18:41] <Flazer> <holstein> if its a blank screen its likely some graphics driver issue that 'nomodeset' would work out
[18:41] <Flazer> that's what you missed when you timed out
[18:42] <holstein> bparticle: i would try other composition options.. such as not having compositing
[18:42] <holstein> bparticle: that is a *key* difference as well.. the live USB has no compositing.. if you enable and hack 3d support on unsupported hardware, that could also slow things down
[18:42] <holstein> bparticle: i would try *not* using that dock
[18:43] <Doc_exe> with teh gma500 did you look at this page? does this help any?
[18:43] <Doc_exe> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo
[18:44] <bparticle> I set up xcompmgr with cairo-dock in the live session and that worked brilliantly actually
[18:45] <holstein> bparticle: and in the install that was "slow" ?
[18:45] <holstein> i use xcompmrg as well, when its not crashy
[18:45] <bparticle> @Doc_exe: yes that helps, I found that page. thanks
[18:45] <wxl> holstein: speaking of compositing, have you tried that new compton ppa?
[18:45] <rpatton> its not loading anything
[18:46] <holstein> wxl: not yet... i read it over, and got distracted
[18:46] <rpatton> wont boot into any OS
[18:46] <holstein> rpatton: any os? it being what?
[18:46] <wxl> holstein: been kind of curious about it
[18:46] <bparticle> @holstein: the one that was slow, I didn't install anything, since the mouse didn't get even move properly
[18:46] <rpatton> xSeries 235 Servers
[18:46] <wxl> rpatton: are you having any drive activity?
[18:47] <rpatton> i got green lights on all hdds and cd dvd drives are working
[18:47] <rpatton> dont know how i can verify activity
[18:48] <wxl> rpatton: you don't have an LED to signal drive activity? that's strange. i don't think i have a computer of any kind anywhre that lacks that.
[18:48] <holstein> bparticle: then, im still voting on the hard drive, or a package update, or lack of that created an issue
[18:48] <holstein> rpatton: what do you mean, no os is booting?
[18:48] <holstein> rpatton: what are you trying to boot? and how?
[18:49] <bparticle> strangely, the 12.04 seems to work flawlessly
[18:49] <Doc_exe> rpatton: might want to check available ram?  since it makes a ram drive when booting up?
[18:50] <wxl> Doc_exe: that's a good call as it seems they inheriently come with 512 if i read correctly. still i can't see why that would keep it from at least booting grub.
[18:50] <wxl> i've had some low-ram machines that had trouble running ubiquity, but no problems with booting into the live environment.
[18:50] <wxl> rpatton: does the alternate install work?
[18:50] <holstein> rpatton: also, if this is a machine that just showed up, you might want a diagnostic disc such as the ultimate boot cd.. run some tests
[18:51] <holstein> i dont know what you mean by "no os boots" but if the hardware is bad, linux wont fix it
[18:53] <rpatton> know where i can get a boot disk ?
[18:53] <holstein> rpatton: to boot what?
[18:54] <holstein> rpatton: i just suggested a disk that "boot".. the lubuntu iso boots as well
[18:54] <rpatton> two of the 4 drives have an orange light as well as the green
[18:54] <holstein> rpatton: i would remove the drives and test a live CD
[18:54] <holstein> http://www.ultimatebootcd.com/
[18:54] <Doc_exe> orange isn't a friend to anyone in the world of computers rpatton
[18:54] <holstein> usually, when i get a machine it that i know nothing about, i remove the drives and test the hardware
[18:55] <wxl> hahahahh Doc_exe
[18:55] <holstein> i test the ram, and listen to the fans and powersupply.. then i might put the drives in one at a time and test them
[18:55] <Doc_exe>  ultimate boot cd is a nice swiss army knife of tools
[18:55] <holstein> i like to do that so at anytime i can force the power off and not break anything
[18:57] <rpatton> so remove all HDD and try to boot from cd
[18:57] <holstein> rpatton: no. do what makes you feel comfortable.. im just saying what i do with machines that i know nothing about
[18:57] <wxl> rpatton: another idea is i could trade you some functional desktop machine i have with your choice of software installed on it for that finnicky server XD
[18:58] <holstein> rpatton: you have a lot of variables there, and you are assuming "no os boots".. you could have bad memory, or *anything*
[18:58] <Doc_exe> bad burn on disk
[18:58] <wxl> keyboard issue
[18:58] <wxl> etc.
[18:59] <wxl> should just give it to me.
[19:13] <powermi> hola
[19:13] <powermi> need help,
[19:15] <powermi> just intalled Lubuntu on a powermac g4 (powerpc)
[19:15] <powermi> but cant boot after this
[19:15] <powermi> just appears a white screen like no SO installed on
[19:30] <rpatton> ATI MACH64 is coming up as the video controller in the config/setup utility
[19:30] <rpatton> with 8128kb of memory
[20:07] <wxl> darn powermi
[20:07] <wxl> always leaving
[20:10] <wxl> rpatton: i see a bunch of old posts talking about problems with that video controller
[20:10] <wxl> that may be your caveat
[20:12] <wxl> Option "AccelMethod" "XAA" in Xorg.conf may fix it
[20:13] <wxl> and here's the official bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-video-mach64/+bug/1077975
[20:13] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1077975 in xserver-xorg-video-mach64 (Ubuntu) "MACH64 video driver crashes with Mach 3D Rage Pro" [Undecided,New]
[20:21] <rpatton> so if its a 12.10 bug will 12.04 work ?
[20:22] <wxl> not necessarily, but it's worth a shot
[20:22] <wxl> like i said there have been problems with that controller for several years now
[20:22] <wxl> whether or not they're show stoppers, i don't know
[20:22] <wxl> at the very least you can confirm that it IS broken in 12.04.
[20:22] <wxl> oops
[20:22] <wxl> 12.10 i mean
[20:24] <rpatton> and how can i try that fix thats listed on the bug the No accel
[20:24] <wxl> just follow the instructions
[20:24] <rpatton> i would say that its confirmed
[20:25] <wxl> of course if you can't boot at all, booting into rescue mode is kind of problematic :/
[20:25] <wxl> that also assumes the system is installed
[20:25] <rpatton> ya thats what i was wondering
[20:26] <wxl> so you could install the system probably by alternate install
[20:26] <wxl> but if i were you i'd try 12.04 first
[20:26] <rpatton> so is there anyway to change drivers?
[20:26] <rpatton> wouldnt hurt
[20:26] <wxl> not likely that will work well :)
[20:37] <rpatton> thanks for the help ttyl
[20:37] <wxl> rpatton: good luck
