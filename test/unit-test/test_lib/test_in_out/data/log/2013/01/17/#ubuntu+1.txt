[07:28] <gnomefreak> anyone having issues running/starting openoffice.org from dashboard?
[07:29] <gnomefreak> it seems ther eis no package for openoffice.org any longer
[07:32] <gnomefreak> i forgot about libre
[07:33] <skp1> im having issues with music stopping periodically. how do io solve this?
[07:33] <skp1> *i
[07:37] <gnomefreak> skp1: start by trying a dfferet player
[07:48] <om26er> skp1, yeah, i say thats gstreamer to blame as i have similar issue in both totem and rhythmbox
[07:59] <skp1> om26er: yeah it happens in vlc too, not as bad though since i moved the music files on to the partition 13.04 is on
[08:10] <om26er> skp1, for the vlc case that's new, that does not happen for me
[08:10] <om26er> if it also happens in vlc then well, it might be pulseaudio that's misbehaving
[08:13] <skp1> om26er: it's happened in every player i've tried. but it has'nt stopped in a while, so maybe an update took care of it.

[16:52] <Walther> Hello folks! I can't get to the graphical desktop. Running raring with all the latest updates.
[16:52] <Walther> nvidia-310, bumblebee, bumblebee-nvidia installed
[16:52] <Walther> but even if I uninstall all those, i can't get to the desktop
[16:52] <Walther> either unity or i3wm

[18:28] <Walther> I'm getting a Fatal server error: failed to activate core devices
[18:28] <Walther> in lightdm.log
[18:33] <Walther> and something about failing to compile keymap
[18:33] <Walther> Any ideas?
[18:53] <Walther> Uh, help would be appreciated. Already third or fourth ongoing day without X
[18:55] <rye> Walther: at what stage it fails, what video hardware, what was changed (if any changes were performed by you)?
[18:56] <Walther> Logging in (lightdm), either to unity or i3wm, it blinks and goes back to login. This started happening after some updates.
[18:56] <Walther> intel i7 ivy bridge CPU -> HD4000 GPU, and a discrete card Nvidia 620M
[18:56] <Walther> bumblebee + nvidia-310 installed
[18:57] <Walther> and like i mentioned, some strange errors mentioned in lightdm.log (failed to compile keymap, fatal server error: could not start core devices)
[18:58] <rye> Walther: ok, what's in ~/.xsession-errors ?
[19:00] <Walther> Script for cjkv started at run_im. Script for default started at run_im. mkdtemp: private socket dir: Permission denied
[19:03] <rye> Walther: are your $HOME permissions correct?
=== io is now known as IdleOne
[19:04] <Walther> haven't touched them, should be
[19:04] <Walther> I do have encrypted home though
[19:04] <rye> Walther: but you can successfully log in from the terminal, right?
[19:04] <rye> as a user
[19:04] <Walther> yes, irccing from there
[19:04] <Walther> tty, that is
[19:07] <rye> Walther: what's the output of ls -ld /tmp ?
[19:08] <Walther> drwxr-xr-x 5 root root  4096 Jan 17 20:59 /tmp
[19:08] <rye> Walther: sudo chmod +t /tmp
[19:09] <rye> Walther: and sudo chmod a+w /tmp
[19:09] <rye> Walther: basically your /tmp was not writeable by anything started from your session
[19:10] <Walther> is /tmp seriously supposed to be drwxrwxrwt?
[19:11] <Walther> also, woo, fixed
[19:11] <rye> Walther: yes, the sticky bit makes the files only accessible by those who created them leaving the dir writable to world nevertheless
[19:12] <Walther> ah
[19:12] <Walther> anyway, fixed, thanks
[19:22] <SwedeMike>  /win 2
[19:22] <SwedeMike> oops
[19:28] <Walther> Uh, what just happened
[19:33] <BluesKaj> " Walther has left this server (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)"
[19:33] <Walther> Oh.
