[00:40] <Fudge> robotfuel what are your aims mate
[00:42] <robotfuel> I just want to make sure that when someone uses core for a project that accessibility is added easily, if it can be. Right now all those packages are removed.
[00:42] <robotfuel> Fudge: ^
[00:42] <Fudge> doesn't core just garuntee package management and hardware, not even users are added
[00:43] <Fudge> it's up to the packages installed to determine accessibility
[00:43] <Fudge> I imagine
[00:47] <robotfuel> Fudge: right. but project leads have to figure out which applications to add and they have tight deadlines. to increase the chances of accessibility being added to the project, it would be nice to have a wiki page. :) 
[00:48] <robotfuel> Fudge: I didn't know about the speakup module, thanks for that info. 
[00:48] <robotfuel> it was a big help
[00:49] <Fudge> well thank you, it's a huge help for blind people when it's thought of
[00:49] <Fudge> sound, software speech
[00:49] <Fudge> sound can be a big problem, it it muted, is the volume down or has it not loaded yet
[00:49] <Fudge> the grub menu beep helps also, configurable in /etc/default/grub but that relys on a pc speaker, which is not always garunteed
