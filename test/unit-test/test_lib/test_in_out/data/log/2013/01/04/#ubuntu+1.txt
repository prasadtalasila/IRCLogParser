[13:55] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[18:31] <TheLordOfTime> are there Lubuntu 13.04 development images yet?
[18:31] <TheLordOfTime> such that we can test the Lubuntu 13.04 environment (VMs)
[18:49] <jbicha> TheLordOfTime: sure, and zsync is a good way to get an image and keep it up-to-date https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ZsyncCdImage
[18:49] <TheLordOfTime> jbicha, if it would install in a VM correctly, i'd do it
[18:50] <TheLordOfTime> unfortunately there's a VM installation problem.  no apport data though
