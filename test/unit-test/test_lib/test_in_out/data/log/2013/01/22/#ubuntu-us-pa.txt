[00:12] <waltman> It's SNOWING!
[04:47] <roasted> :D
[04:47] <roasted> my better half and I struck a deal tonight
[04:48] <roasted> if I get the trim installed in the bathroom, I can have my 2x3TB HDDs I want to order for my server.
[04:48] <roasted> She even agreed to let me order them a while. Only catch is, she keeps the package until I get the trim installed.
[04:48] <roasted> Pfft.
[04:48] <roasted> At least it cuts ship time out of the situation, I suppose.
[04:48] <TheLordOfTime> lol
[04:51] <roasted> I tried to justify to her that I need to at the very least install them in the server and run a long test against them to ensure their integrity.
[04:51] <roasted> She wasn't buying it. :(
[04:52] <TheLordOfTime> you could have her send the drives over to here so i can integrity test them for you...
[04:52] <TheLordOfTime> no chance of you ever seeing the drives though :P
[04:53] <roasted> pfft!
[04:53] <roasted> I bet you could use a pair of 3TB Reds, eh? :P
[04:53] <TheLordOfTime> yep
[04:54] <roasted> I wonder how long it'll take to build a 3TB mirror

[19:14]  * pleia2 waves from the past, where it is still morning
[19:15]  * waltman waves from the future, where it's finally warmed up to 21F.
[19:15] <waltman> So you've got that to look forward to!
[19:16] <pleia2> hehe
[19:17] <pleia2> supposed to get up to 65F here today!
[19:19] <ChinnoDog> heat wave
[19:19] <pleia2> that's normal for here now ;)
[19:30] <ChinnoDog> Let's all move to pleia2's for the winter. I claim the couch.
[19:31] <waltman> You can have the couch. It's probably all covered with cat hair. :)
[19:31]  * waltman wheezes
[19:34] <waltman> At least it'll be nice weather for rioting if the Niners win the Super Bowl :)
[20:26] <pleia2> fortunately it's a leather couch
[20:26] <pleia2> woo riots
=== mutantturkey is now known as MobileTurkey
[21:52] <MobileTurkey> what if i told you i don't know diddly squad about sysadmin and im now a sysadmin
[21:53] <MobileTurkey> worried? yes
[21:54] <waltman> surprised? no
[21:55] <MobileTurkey> heh
[22:09] <ChinnoDog> +1
[22:10] <ChinnoDog> congrats Turkey. Try not to break anything.
[22:10] <JonathanD> He's running limerick power plant.
[22:10] <pleia2> it's a good thing I moved
[22:11] <ChinnoDog> Try not to irradiate anyone
[22:11] <JonathanD> How do you think he became a mutant turkey in the first place/
[22:11] <waltman> At least it's not something important, like monitoring the brewing tanks at Victory.
[22:11] <pleia2> waltman: +1
[22:11] <JonathanD> According to xkcd it's safe to swim in the cooling rod pools.
[22:12] <ChinnoDog> Sounds like a good way to end up with an odd number of paired organs.
[22:13] <JonathanD> ChinnoDog: apparently in most of the pool, the radiation level is lower than on the street.
[22:13] <JonathanD> Water is VERY good at cutting radiation.
[22:13] <JonathanD> http://what-if.xkcd.com/29/
[22:29] <ChinnoDog> I'd rather not tempt fate.
