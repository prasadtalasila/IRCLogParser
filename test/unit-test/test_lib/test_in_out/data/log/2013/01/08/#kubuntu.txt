[02:30] <decci> When I try to install ubuntu 12.04. The installation cannot see the SAN storage device as shown http://tracker.webtechnologyfocused.com.au/ehw/volumesnotdetected.jpg

[03:50] <vladimir_> Why don't we have an standard in plug and play for all devices to conect them to ours PCs?
[03:51] <vladimir_> Why do we have to wait to some developers in order to have the hability to plug ours devices to our PCs?
[03:52] <vladimir_> To plug and play our devices in ours PCs must be mandatory..not an option of some company..it must be an universal right
[03:55] <vladimir_> Apple, Android, Window's Phone, all the Tablets must be able to plug and play in any pc, as a universal and mantatory option..
[03:55] <vladimir_> if I am disturbing someone here, please just tell me
[03:56] <vladimir_> And I will Shut up..
[03:56] <rats__> I agree vladimir_
[03:57] <vladimir_> ok, Rats_> but, you agree to what...to the universal plug and play..or you agree that I must shut up?
[03:57] <rats__> so I dont buy those devices
[03:57] <vladimir_> Well, actually, I am using Blackberry, because I need it in my work
[03:57] <rats__> so I dont buy those devices
[03:57] <vladimir_> Some people do simple have to use thouse devices
[03:58] <rats__> PnP
[03:58] <vladimir_> as a matter of Work..
[03:59] <rats__> just have to bite the bullet then
[03:59] <vladimir_> I think..that any device must have, as a default feature, the hability to plug and play in any OS..
[03:59] <vladimir_> I do use Linux, now I am writing from Kubuntu
[03:59] <rats__> I agree[3~
[03:59] <rats__> same
[04:00] <rats__> 12.04
[04:00] <vladimir_> ok.. 12.04 its nice,
[04:01] <rats__> I like LTS distros
[04:01] <vladimir_> Me too..I was in 10.04 until 12.04 were released
[04:02] <vladimir_> But, I decided to try 12.10
[04:03] <worm> I like LTS if I am using KDE...
[04:04] <rats__> there was alot of things I liked better in 10.04 though
[04:05] <worm> 10.10 improved a lot by adding Unity, and 12.04 removed some of my favorite behavior of the Unity dock. However Kubuntu is with almost the same experience.
[04:06] <vladimir_> For me KDE is spectacular..but Unity is simplicity..
=== bazhang_ is now known as bazhang
[04:07] <vladimir_> May be you wont see simplicity in Unity in a 30 minutes session. But if you use Unity in a intensive way..may be you will find its simplicity..its very practical
[04:08] <vladimir_> <worm> I think that Unity is better now than it was in 11.04
[04:08] <juacom99> Hi one question: Every time i boot my kubuntu 12.04 i get some of the desktop efects disable, when i go to Sysyem-settings->desktop effects->advanced->and change composition type (i got 2 xrender and openGl) i get the effecvts back. so what can i do so the effecvts are aveilables on boot?
[04:11] <juacom99> i got opengl 1.4 and a Gforce 7300
[04:14] <vladimir_> <juacom99> In my case, and this is not a solution, I do not use Graphics Card..May be it can sound wild or strange, but I am not a Gamer nor a Image or Video Editor, so I do not need a Graphics card. And with the integrated graphics of my mother board I do have all de effects with no problem
[04:16] <vladimir_> <juacom99> In a lot of situations graphics cards work fine in Linux, but ussually a lot of users have problems with them
[04:16] <juacom99> vladimir_: mmm my mother don't support the effects, and i game a lot so i need that card :(
[04:16] <vladimir_> Ok, I understand
[04:16] <vladimir_> But check if you have lunux-headers-generic installed
[04:17] <juacom99> vladimir_: i think is not an issue with the grafic card since when i chnage the render type it enable the effects
[04:17] <juacom99> i'm almost suar i have lunux-headers-generic but let me check
[04:18] <juacom99> vladimir_: i'm guessing is a xorg.conf problem...
[04:18] <vladimir_> Check if you have installed linux-headers-generic this pakage is needed in order that any graphics card work fine
[04:19] <juacom99> i do version 3.2.0.35.40
[04:19] <vladimir_> <juancom99> well, may be it is xorg.conf... but give it a try to my point, and just check in google.. linux-headers-generic + graphics Cards + Linux + Ubuntu
[04:20] <juacom99> i'll give it a try thanks vladimir_
[04:21] <vladimir_> ok.. U're wellcome

[08:03] <kubuntuser> hello
[08:09] <sbivol> kubuntuser: hi
[08:09] <kubuntuser> hi sbivol
[08:10] <kubuntuser> anyone tried the daily of today ?
[08:15] <sbivol> not yet, but I plan to test Raring today
[08:16] <kubuntuser> sbivol: i have the daily of yesterday tried on usb..
[08:16] <kubuntuser> sbivol: i like it :)
[08:17] <sbivol> kubuntuser: I'm running 12.10 with KDE 4.9.97
[08:18] <kubuntuser> sbivol: i have kde 4.9.97 in this build
[08:19] <sbivol> kubuntuser: could you please tell me what version of plasma-widget-networkmanagement is in 13.04?
[08:20] <kubuntuser> sbivol: 0.9.0.5-0ubuntu3
[08:21] <sbivol> :-| I was hoping it's 0.9.0.6 already...
[08:22] <kubuntuser> sbivol: i don't know maybe the daily of today have it
[08:24] <sbivol> kubuntuser: talked to Riddell last week and he hinted that 0.9.0.6 will be in 13.04 :-)
[08:30] <RagnaRok__> #amd
[08:32] <Jarris> in our small business kubuntu runs on our workstations, and we spend a lot time doing release upgrades each half year on each client. how do you deal with this?
[08:32] <Jarris> are you using trminal-server or is there any reliable sort of upgrade routine? any hints are welcome
[08:33] <sbivol> Jarris: a big speed gain would be setting a local APT mirror if you have 10+ workstations
[08:34] <sbivol> Jarris: a tool from Canonical, Landscape, is intended to manage lots of workstations. I'm sure it handles upgrades as well
[08:35] <Jarris> sbivol: we have an apt-chacher
[08:35] <shadeslayer> Use LTS releases?
[08:35] <Jarris> but never heard abouit that tool
[08:35] <shadeslayer> upgrade every < 5 years and you should be good :)
[08:36] <sbivol> Jarris: https://landscape.canonical.com/
[08:36] <Jarris> shadeslayer: ouer coders alsways want new software
[08:37] <Jarris> like db stuff etc.
[08:37] <shadeslayer> ah
[08:37] <Jarris> sbivol: ty, i will have a look, sounds good
[08:37] <shadeslayer> then Landscape should help
[08:41] <Jarris> does someone know the cost of it?
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[08:52] <sbivol> Jarris: I think you'll find out after registration. You have 30 days trial
[08:53] <Jarris> sbivol: thanks, i saw that, but didnt wont to register just to see the cost are way to big for our companie
[09:07] <hateball> Jarris: I think it's like... $50 per machine or something
[09:07] <hateball> It's not cheap. But then again, time spent doing manual stuff is not cheap either.
[09:08] <Jarris> hateball: once or each year/month
[09:08] <tsimpson> Jarris: you can use http://www.ubuntu.com/business/systems-management/contact-us to ask for pricing information, but http://www.ubuntu.com/business/systems-management/how-to-get-landscape suggests it's part of the "Ubuntu Advantage" support package from Canonical
[09:09] <Jarris> tsimpson: that means what?
[09:09] <tsimpson> that means it's part of a package rather than available stand-alone
[09:10] <hateball> Another alternative would be to set up puppet yourself
[09:10] <tsimpson> but use the contact form to clarify that

[12:01] <ovidiu-florin> how can I pass a command line argument to an alias?
[12:02] <shadeslayer> duck it
[12:02] <tsimpson> ovidiu-florin: alias foo="bar --baz --buz"
[12:03] <shadeslayer> also, create a function instead of an alias
[12:03] <ovidiu-florin> i tried both ways
[12:03] <ovidiu-florin> look: function kp() { ps x | grep "$@" | head -n 1 | cut -c -5 ;}
[12:03] <ovidiu-florin> this does not work as expected
[12:03] <shadeslayer> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/941338/shell-script-how-to-pass-command-line-arguments-to-an-unix-alias
[12:03] <shadeslayer> maybe pass $1 ?
[12:04] <tsimpson> you can't use variables like that in aliases, but you can in functions
[12:05] <tsimpson> an alias is just a "key" that's replaced with a value
[12:05] <ovidiu-florin> shadeslayer: I tried with $1 and when I run 'kp dolphin' I get: 'grep: dolphin: No such file or directory'
[12:06] <shadeslayer> that function works in zsh
[12:07] <tsimpson> works in bash too
[12:07] <ovidiu-florin> waht is zsh?
[12:07] <shadeslayer> !zsh
[12:07] <ovidiu-florin> I'm using bash
[12:07] <shadeslayer> hmm
[12:07] <shadeslayer> ovidiu-florin: it's a better shell
[12:07] <shadeslayer> atleast I think its' better
[12:07] <tsimpson> I copied your function, replaced "$@" with "$1", and it seems to work here
[12:08] <shadeslayer> it also works with $@
[12:08] <ovidiu-florin> I have Kubuntu 12.04. Why doesn't it work here?
[12:10] <tsimpson> when you say it doesn't work as expected, what do you mean?
[12:11] <ovidiu-florin> ovidiu@ODWL:~$ kp dolphin
[12:11] <ovidiu-florin> grep: dolphin: No such file or directory
[12:11] <ovidiu-florin> this is the function from ~/.bashrc: function kp() { ps x | grep "$1" | head -n 1 | cut -c -5 ;}
[12:11] <tsimpson> when you run "command -V kp" does it show the correct commands?
[12:12] <ovidiu-florin> no
[12:12] <tsimpson> what does it show then?
[12:12] <ovidiu-florin> it shows something I tried long ago
[12:12] <ovidiu-florin> kp is aliased to `ps x | grep \!^ '
[12:14] <ovidiu-florin> closed and reopened the konsole, it seems to work now
[12:14] <ovidiu-florin> thank you tsimpson
[12:14] <shadeslayer> heh
[12:14] <shadeslayer> don't forget to source your bashrc everytime
[12:15] <ovidiu-florin> I did.... But apparently nothing happened
[12:15] <ovidiu-florin> thank you all
[12:15] <ovidiu-florin> here's my final command: function kp() { kill -15 $( ps x | grep "$1" | head -n 1 | cut -c -5) ;}
[12:17] <ovidiu-florin> can I run this from krunner?
[12:17] <ovidiu-florin> I tried but nothing happenes
[12:18] <tsimpson> you probably need to logout and back in to update the shell the GUI runs in, and you'll want to actually display the output somehow
[12:18] <tsimpson> probably via kdialog
[12:18] <tsimpson> if there is a result to display
[12:19] <shadeslayer> hmm
[12:19] <shadeslayer> has anyone tried customizing entries in the Right Click > Create New  list?
[12:19] <shadeslayer> I don't quite remember how that can be customized
[12:20] <zoie> hello, how can i remove the terminal on the bottom of kate? http://i.imgur.com/0vpjX.png is there also a way to remove the scroll updown/leftright bars?
[12:20] <ovidiu-florin> shadeslayer: you mean add custom entrues in the context menu?
[12:21] <shadeslayer> ovidiu-florin: yeah
[12:21] <shadeslayer> more specifically the "Create new" context menu
[12:21] <ovidiu-florin> thet's the context menu of dolphin, I think
[12:22] <tsimpson> shadeslayer: apparently it's /usr/share/templates
[12:22] <shadeslayer> oic
[12:22] <ovidiu-florin> shadeslayer: http://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=10667#p13168
[12:23] <shadeslayer> neato, thx guys
[12:24] <ovidiu-florin> zoie: there should be a terminal or konsole button on the left edge of kate
[12:25] <zoie> ovidiu-florin: my kate is like that: http://i.imgur.com/DoTqv.png i want to remove the left bar with the document browser/kate snippets choice, as well as the terminal on the bottom and the scroll bars
[12:28] <ovidiu-florin> zoie: View > view Tools > show side bars
[12:28] <ovidiu-florin> I hope I translated that correctly
[12:28] <ovidiu-florin> I'm testing ubuntu in Romanian right now
[12:28] <ovidiu-florin> kubuntu*
[12:29] <ovidiu-florin> zoie: or: ctrl+ alt+ shift + F
[12:29] <zoie> ovidiu-florin: it was tools view :) but thanks ye that's it
[12:29] <zoie> tool views*
[12:32] <ovidiu-florin> my default browser is Google chorme but links from certant applications like Quassel open in Firefox, how could I fix that?
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[12:47] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: when you're done testing the Romanian translations, please tell me your impressions :)
[12:48] <ovidiu-florin> sbivol: are you romanian?
[12:48] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: I'm the translator
[12:49] <ovidiu-florin> the translation is mostly very good
[12:49] <ovidiu-florin> but missing some strings. There still is work to be done.
[12:49] <hateball> ovidiu-florin: there is a kcm module for "standard applications"
[12:50] <ovidiu-florin> for me is very weird because I'm uset to kubuntu in english
[12:50] <hateball> ovidiu-florin: I've had that go back to firefox at random, when changing something seemingly unrelated elsewhere
[12:50] <ovidiu-florin> but I'm getting used to it
[12:51] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: take your time. if there's anything you don't like or an application that you use often and want it translated, drop me a mail (sergiu@ase.md)
[12:51] <ovidiu-florin> sbivol: Quassel settings isn't translated
[12:52] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: I started using Quassel last week (and IRC too!) so I didn't bother translating it before. Will do it this week
[12:53] <ovidiu-florin> thanks hateball. I double checked the default browser in system settings and it was firefox. It's ok now. :D
[12:53] <hateball> ovidiu-florin: :)
[12:54] <ovidiu-florin> sbivol: If I may say, In the name of the Kubuntu comunity, Thank you.
[12:54] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: you're welcome :-)
[12:55] <ovidiu-florin> sbivol: are your translations going straight to kde? or just kubuntu?
[12:56] <sbivol> ovidiu-florin: to KDE. then KDE -> Kubuntu

[15:48] <BarkingFish> afternoon guys.  i've got a rather nice keyboard here with some multimedia functions on it which don't work at the moment - i'd like to map them to relevant functions and i don't know how.  can someone help me figure this out please? thanks
[15:50] <guest128> first of all you need to make sure that the keys are correctly recognized by the X server. You can use a console application called "xev" for that.
[15:51] <guest128> if they generate events in xev you can either configure them through KDE's systemsettings or via another console application called "xbindkeys"
[15:52] <luk-> hi, anyone knows how access to old/new transition table in postgresql?
[15:53] <BarkingFish> excellent, thanks guest128 - i know a couple of them work already, like the volume + and -, mute, sleep and poweroff
[15:53] <BarkingFish> the ones which don't are browser, email, and the play/stop/ff/rew controls for a media player
[15:57] <BarkingFish> right, guest128, they all generate xevents and have different keycodes, so I can bind those without much messing around, right?
[15:59] <guest128> you are lucky that they all create key codes ;)
[15:59] <guest128> you might also want to add the keycodes to your ~/.Xmodmap file
[15:59] <BarkingFish> so where in systemsettings do I go to bind them all to events?
[15:59] <BarkingFish> ^please
[15:59]  * BarkingFish is forgetting his manners today
[16:00] <BarkingFish> i don't seem to have an Xmodmap file :)
[16:00] <guest128> yeah, before you can do anything useful with those keycodes you have to add them to the Xmodmap
[16:00] <guest128> okay, simply create one
[16:00] <guest128> one entry could be: "keycode 179 = XF86Music"
[16:01] <guest128> just adjust the keycode and the event it creates
[16:01] <BarkingFish> so i could use keycode 180 = vlc  and it would launch vlc?
[16:01] <guest128> no
[16:02] <BarkingFish> this is all new territory for me, please excuse me if I sound like a total newb
[16:02] <guest128> sorry, my first description with xev and xbindkeys was a bit misleading
[16:02] <guest128> your get the keycode from xev
[16:02] <Desert_> guest128: does it work by using the Gestures and Shortcuts in kde System Preferences?
[16:02] <guest128> you put that keycode along with a *valid* XF86* event in your Xmodmap
[16:02] <guest128> and THEN you can use either systemsettings or xbindkeys to bind the keys to actual applications
[16:03] <BarkingFish> ok, i assume i can get a list of valid XF86 events somewhere
[16:03] <guest128> there is a list of valid XF86* events somewhere under /usr/share/X11 I believe, but I don't remember where :(
[16:04] <BarkingFish> ok, i'll go take a  look :)
[16:04] <BarkingFish> haha - never mind. xev generated them itself :)
[16:05] <BarkingFish> for the web browser key it generated:
[16:05] <BarkingFish> state 0x0, keycode 180 (keysym 0x1008ff18, XF86HomePage)
[16:05] <guest128> yeah, that's good
[16:06] <BarkingFish> i still need to add them to the xmodmap though, correct?
[16:06] <guest128> under keyboard settings in KDE's system settings you should already be able to assign that key
[16:06] <guest128> no, you don't need to add the keys that generate XF86* events to your xmodmap
[16:07] <BarkingFish> ok, cheers :D
[16:09] <guest128> BarkingFish: you can grab some valid XF86 events from this mail: http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/xlibs-commit/2007-November/003152.html
[16:11] <BarkingFish> it looks like i can only bind the keys to kde programs - the media keys are bound to amarok, the www key is bound to konqueror and the email key is bound to kmail - none of which i use :(
[16:11] <BarkingFish> music is via VLC, web via Firefox and email via Thunderbird
[16:15] <guest128> strange, I've never experienced that
[16:15] <guest128> you might then want to try xbindkeys
[16:16] <guest128> it also need's some text-based configuration and you have to autostart it every time you log on, just as xmodmap
[16:18] <BarkingFish> ok, will look into it later - i'm gonna have to hop down to work in a minute
[16:19] <BarkingFish> got to go, back in about 2 hours or so

[17:48] <petersaints> Why was rekonq released on Kubuntu PPA for Raring instead of Quantal? https://launchpad.net/~kubuntu-ppa/+archive/backports/+packages?field.name_filter=rekonq&field.status_filter=published&field.series_filter=
[17:49] <dniMretsaM> petersaints: it probably requires a never version of KDE than is available for Quantal
[17:50] <petersaints> dniMretsaM: Well KDE 4.9.x is currently available via backports, and that's the latest version.
[17:51] <dniMretsaM> it might be built on the 4.10 RCs
[17:51] <petersaints> also the package says 2.0-0ubuntu1~ubuntu12.10.1~ppa1. Shouldn't be 13.04 if it was for Raring? Or Raring, since it's a pre-release, it's 12.10.1?
[17:52] <dniMretsaM> non-LTS releases don't get point releases, I don't think, so it's probably just a mislabel
[17:53] <petersaints> exactly dniMretsaM I think it's strange so I was just checking if it wasn't mistake made by the maintainer (Riddell in this case)
[17:53] <dniMretsaM> It could be. it does seem strange
[17:54] <dniMretsaM> let me check something
[17:56] <petersaints> ok dniMretsaM tks for your attention
[17:57] <dniMretsaM> the INSTALL file says the minimum kdelibs version is 4.9.0
[17:58] <dniMretsaM> ima try to compile it and see what happens
[18:00] <petersaints> dniMretsaM: I tried installing the deb file and it runs just fine in Quantal (with KDE 4.9.5). I may try to compile it later.
[18:00] <yofel> petersaints: the backport was done to the wrong release, that's all, fixing
[18:01] <petersaints> yofel: yeah I thought it was exactly that. That's why I came here to see if someone else also noticed it or I was just wrong ;)
[18:01] <dniMretsaM> thanks, yofel
[18:02] <dniMretsaM> and it compiles just fine
[18:02] <petersaints> yeah tks yofel
[18:03] <petersaints> I thought it was strange to see rekonq 2.0 on other distros "backport-like repositories" but it was still not on Kubuntu. So I decided to check out the ppa website :P
[18:04] <yofel> thanks for noticing :)
[18:06] <BluesKaj> so has the quantal backport been edited ?
