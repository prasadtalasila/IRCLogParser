[01:26] <Azelphur> valve has originally ported their original half life original title original to linux original.
[01:44] <popey> Azelphur: and cs:source by the look of it
[01:44] <Azelphur> :o
[01:44] <Azelphur> this is a good day.
[01:44] <Azelphur> even though my boiler has apparently died and the house is getting cold, this is still a good day.
[01:44] <Azelphur> xD
[05:41] <MartijnVdS> Azelphur: fire up half life.. have your GPU keep you warm ;)
[07:27] <knightwise> hey MartijnVdS
[07:27] <knightwise> you are up early
[08:00] <diplo> Morning
[08:08] <knightwise> hey directhex
[08:08] <knightwise> hey diplo
[08:28] <kvarley> Can anybody recommend a good RAW viewer? I don't want an editor or album manager, just a viewer like the default image viewer does for JPGs, etc in Ubuntu
[08:33] <MartijnVdS> kvarley: rawtherapee?
[08:34] <MartijnVdS> kvarley: or, if you set the default viewer to "Shotwell viewer" you just get the viewer part of shotwell
[08:34] <MartijnVdS> not the manager bits
[08:38] <kvarley> MartijnVdS: Ok ty
[08:39] <kvarley> Another question, is it possible to use VirtualBox to install Ubuntu on an actual hard drive? /dev/sdc for example? I have a netbook that is a problem and need some bootable OS to test it with
[08:39] <kvarley> Loading from USB on this model is being awkward
[08:45] <popey> being awkward how?
[08:46] <kvarley> popey: The system goes really slow after 5 mins last time I tried it
[08:46] <kvarley> I think the CPU may have overheated in the past
[08:47] <kvarley> It was a while ago tho so I need to try USB again really
[08:52] <AlanBell> morning all
[08:52] <TheOpenSourcerer> mornign all.
[08:52]  * TheOpenSourcerer has produced a screencast. Would like AlanBell to review it before going public...
[08:53] <popey> morning
[08:53] <popey> never seen that kvarley
[08:53] <TheOpenSourcerer> Thanks for the etherpad stuff popey that was useful.
[08:53] <popey> np
[08:59] <knightwise> hey popey TheOpenSourcerer
[08:59] <TheOpenSourcerer> wotcha knightwise
[08:59] <kvarley> popey: Checked  the HDD still works, that is fine. Reassembling the netbook then gonna try booting Ubuntu via a SATA CD drive
[09:00] <knightwise> Netbooks are cool :)
[09:01] <knightwise> did this weeks podcast on "bringing your netbook back to life'
[09:01] <kvarley> knightwise: Netbooks are dead lol
[09:02] <kvarley> knightwise: I just figure if I can make this one work I can give it to a relative
[09:02] <kvarley> Surprising amount of dust in this one considering it was so tightly sealed
[09:02] <knightwise> kvarley: i disagree http://knightwise.com/kw503-return-of-the-netbook/
[09:03] <knightwise> Been using one as my main 'portable thin client' for the last week.
[09:03] <knightwise> loving it so far!
[09:03] <einonm> I tried putting Ubuntu server 11.10 on my netbook last week - just hung there after I filled in all the forms at the start. So it's still on life support...
[09:05] <directhex> counter-strike 1.6 for linux too. fancy.
[09:06] <kvarley> directhex: Has that been added too? I'm really hoping for CS:GO
[09:09] <directhex> kvarley, half-added. requires badgers to run
[09:10] <kvarley> directhex: hehe ok
[09:10] <directhex> kvarley, http://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/178xsx/native_counterstrike_16_on_steam_for_linux/
[09:10] <kvarley> Taking this netbook has made me realise a few things. 1) Netbook ribbon cables are actually sensibly placed. 2) Netbooks shouldn't be opened. 3) Only 1 fan in the whole netbook for the GPU is stupid
[09:11] <kvarley> directhex: Thanks, I may have to try this out
[09:20] <popey> directhex: i don't have a beta tab in properties of CS:Source
[09:20] <directhex> popey, where did i say CS:Source?
[09:20] <popey> ignore me
[09:21] <kvarley> popey: It lives ... sort of
[09:21] <kvarley> I'm booting from live USB
[09:24] <kvarley> The netbook is held together with about 30 screws but none of them are actually needed. Everything snaps into place
[09:25] <popey> which netbook?
[09:25] <kvarley> Asus 1201N
[09:25] <popey> oh, thats similar to wifeys 1008HA
[09:26] <popey> I say "wifeys" she hasn't touched it in a year or more
[09:26] <kvarley> hehe
[09:26] <kvarley> I didn't miss this fan noise one bit

[10:04] <rowinggolfer> built a server yesterday. 2*1TB drives in raid 10 configuration. Followed the howto here. https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/advanced-installation.html
[10:04] <rowinggolfer> really, really good documentation :)
[10:05] <rowinggolfer> 5 year support was the differentiator for me.
[10:05] <rowinggolfer> ie.. there are still many things that canonical are doing right.
[10:06] <TheOpenSourcerer> Anyone got any experience with sakis3g?
[10:08] <rowinggolfer> never heard of it.. and I can't get to http://www.sakis3g.org/
[10:08] <brobostigon> good morning everyone.
[10:09] <rowinggolfer> morning brobostigon
[10:09] <brobostigon> morning rowinggolfer
[10:17] <directhex> rowinggolfer, 2 drives in raid10?
[10:22] <knightwise> got a little grub question here
[10:22] <knightwise> anyone in ?
[10:23] <dwatkins> no, they're all having a snowball fight
[10:23] <andylockran> morning
[10:23] <knightwise> morning
[10:23] <knightwise> i'm installing ubuntu on my macbook and doing the manual partitioning thing
[10:24] <knightwise> ive got an Ssd drive (sda)
[10:24] <knightwise> i just created a root partition and a home partition
[10:24] <directhex> dual-booting the macbook or not?
[10:24] <knightwise> it has placed them on SDa1 and SDA2
[10:24] <knightwise> Single booting
[10:24] <knightwise> no dual boot
[10:24] <knightwise> now it leaves 1 megabyte of free space on SDA
[10:24] <knightwise> (donno why)
[10:25] <knightwise> question is : Where do i install grub
[10:25] <knightwise> /dev/sda or /dev/sda1 ?
[10:25] <andylockran> knightwise: I used refit for mac
[10:25] <knightwise> yeah , but in order to install refit you need to install osx first
[10:25] <andylockran> and installed grub to the partition, rather than to the disk
[10:26] <andylockran> ah, ok
[10:26] <knightwise> ok, but can you install refit without osx ?
[10:26] <knightwise> because when I boot , I just get a blinkin cursor
[10:27] <knightwise> so i have the feeling the grub isnt doing anything or isnt even working.
[10:27] <knightwise> So do i install grub to /sda (which is one megabyte, empty space)
[10:27] <knightwise> or to /sda1 where i have my / partition ?
[10:27] <andylockran> sounds like you need to have a mini OSX partition on there
[10:28] <knightwise> smells like it.
[10:28] <knightwise> perhaps do a 10 gig osx install.. and then go with Refit ?
[10:29] <andylockran> yeah, I just read a recommendation of 10-15GB for the OSX partition
[10:29] <andylockran> as youll need it for firmware updates to the macbook too
[10:29] <knightwise> yeah , i thought about that too
[10:30] <knightwise> its that , i only have a 128 ssd
[10:30] <knightwise> so i would like to keep the osx footprint to a minimum
[10:30] <andylockran> https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=925992
[10:30] <directhex> at this point i'm super concerned about your setup
[10:30] <davmor2> Morning all
[10:31] <directhex> macs don't use BIOS booting, they expect a GPT-partitioned disk with an EFI boot partition
[10:31] <knightwise> holdon
[10:31] <directhex> whether you also have a shadow MBR table as well is a secondary issue
[10:31] <knightwise> installer is telling me i should install a 35 meg efi boot partition first ! :)
[10:32] <andylockran> I have read that grub2 were working on a open source 'bless' for EFI
[10:32] <knightwise> so i think i have to put the bootloader in there
[10:32] <knightwise> ok , giving it a whirl
[10:33] <knightwise> the workaround i have is that i use an osx installer disk to do the firmware updates :)
[10:35] <andylockran> that'd work
[10:42] <rowinggolfer> directhex, yes.
[10:43] <rowinggolfer> directhex, it appears counter intuitive, but raid10 < raid 5
[10:43] <knightwise> directhex: super concerned ?  about me ?
=== timp__ is now known as timp2
[10:44] <knightwise> hmmm
[10:45] <knightwise> there is a shadow table there somewhere
[10:45] <knightwise> now the mac says it cannot find a bootable os
[10:45] <directhex> rowinggolfer, raid10 needs 4 disks.
[10:53] <knightwise> ok , going the other route
[10:53] <knightwise> installing a 20 gig OSX partition and using Refit
[10:59] <rowinggolfer> directhex, that's a common configuration, but 2 disks is the minimum.
[10:59] <directhex> that doesn't make any sense
[11:00] <directhex> raid 0 is striping data across 2 or more disks. raid 1 is mirroring data across 2 or more disks. unless you're doing partition-level mirroring or striping which is, well, stupid since it'll decrease performance not increase it
[11:01] <rowinggolfer> I'm not looking for performance.
[11:01] <rowinggolfer> but redundancy.
[11:02] <shauno> then why add striping?
[11:23] <timp2> Hi, I am trying to install amd ubuntu 12.10 from external usb CD drive, it semed to be working, but screen went blank, now I have just had the little drum roll, but completely blank screen
[11:23] <timp2> Ctrl Alt F1 does nothing
[11:23] <timp2> Sorry, on an 18month old macbookPro
[11:24] <directhex> rowinggolfer, then what on earth does using partition-level raid 0 gain you, other than complexity and another layer of potential failure?
[11:24] <knightwise> hey timp
[11:24] <knightwise> did you use refit ?
[11:24] <timp2> hi knightwise
[11:24] <timp2> efi ?
[11:25] <knightwise> are you singlebooting  or dual booting ?
[11:25] <rowinggolfer> directhex, to be honest, I dunno. I'll need to revisit this.
[11:25] <timp2> dual booting,
[11:25] <knightwise> have you installed REFIT on your OSX os
[11:25] <knightwise> that will help you to dual boot
[11:26] <timp2> yes, I think so,
[11:26] <knightwise> did you take a look at the howto i sent you yesterday ?
[11:26] <knightwise> http://maketecheasier.com/install-ubuntu-12-10-in-macbook-air/2012/11/08
[11:26] <timp2> yes, and that was pretty much what I did originally
[11:27] <knightwise> ok
[11:27] <knightwise> ubuntu try this
[11:27] <timp2> though I am trying from a usb DVD
[11:27] <knightwise> its an old hawto but it has to do with your grub settyings
[11:28] <knightwise> wait , have you installed it yet ? or just trying to boot from the livce cd  ?
[11:28] <timp2> I suspect it is the video firmware, possibly due to it having been updatd.
[11:28] <knightwise>  seems that something in the Macbook power management causes a kernel panic, so you’ll need to run the installer with the “noapic” option (press space at the splash screen, then F6). Note: you may need to reboot several times, as the installer may kernel panic before you have the option to set “noapic”. Also, note that the wifi won’t work (we’ll fix this in the next step), so don’t try to install updates during the inst
[11:28] <knightwise> Once the installation finishes, you’ll need to boot up with the noapic option (press ‘e’ in GRUB and add it to the kernel parameters, right next to “splash” and “quiet”), and then add it permanently once you’ve booted up. You can find detailed directions for both of these steps in the Ubuntu guide for Kernel Boot Parameters
[11:29] <knightwise> See step 4 of this manual : http://cberner.com/2012/07/10/installing-ubuntu-12-04-on-macbook-pro-retina/
[11:30] <timp2> knightwise: thanks, looks like I need to blockout a bit more time than I have this minute, but thanks, I will read those and start again when I get back
[11:31] <knightwise> no worries , good lucj !
[11:38] <kvarley> I just ran updates and my xorg conf got wiped because I have manually installed AMD graphics drivers. Will restoring the xorg conf work or will I also have to add the kernel modules again? I'm not sure if my kernel got updated or not

[11:40] <TheOpenSourcerer> :-D
[11:40] <TheOpenSourcerer> Yeah - got that a b it wrong but couldn't be bothered to go back
[11:40] <diplo> Trying to make it stand out from the text/console one by adding features that we can't do in the old one
[11:43] <directhex> rowinggolfer, if you're using RAID0 across partitions on the same drive, i.e. sda1 and sda2 are raid0'd, sdb1 and sdb2 are raid0'd, and md0 and md1 are raid1'd, then you'll actually gain less than nothing - you'll decrease performance compared to just using flat raid1, as all sequential disk reads/writes larger than the raid0 stripe size are no longer sequential, they're random (as the disk needs to bounce between stripes on both partition

[12:36] <constrictor> thanks daftykins
[12:39] <daftykins> just had two synology NAS' turn up along with 4 x 2TB WD Reds :)
[12:40] <directhex> daftykins, for RAID10? :p
[12:41] <daftykins> lol no
[12:42] <daftykins> two separate two bay units
[12:42] <daftykins> amusingly these are backups for RAIDs
[12:43] <daftykins> just had to phone verified by visa due to a rejection ordering something from a website
[12:44] <daftykins> 'we haven't got enough trained advisors right now, we can give you a call back in 30 mins'
[12:44] <daftykins> nice
[13:20] <daftykins> heh these little Synology NAS' are cute :>
[13:23] <dwatkins> daftykins: agreed, I'm considering getting a DS413j
[13:24] <dwatkins> the interface is pretty good, it seems to run a linux, and they're not too pricey
[13:24] <dwatkins> also, loads of plug 'n play applications for them
[13:24] <daftykins> :)
[13:25] <daftykins> got a couple of the super basic 212j's for some clients backup
[13:25] <daftykins> just fitted the drives, powered on and installed the OS over the network
[13:27] <daftykins> very neat web UI
[13:30] <daftykins> and off it goes creating the RAID1 setup :>
[13:36] <daftykins> ext4 is its' poison
[13:37] <popey> \o/ btrfs
[13:37] <gord> \o/ whatever we use by default because i'm too lazy to use anything else
[13:39] <mgdm> \o/ ext3
[13:39]  * mgdm avoids btrfs
[13:39] <daftykins> it's checking all the sectors now, i like this
[13:43] <davmor2> mgdm: ext4 I think you'll find is the default :P
[13:44] <popey> mgdm: wuss!
[13:44] <mgdm> I've not formatted a partition in ages, so defaults don't matter :)
[13:50] <BigRedS> I kep meaning to have a fiddle with btrfs, but I don't have a large body of data that I'm not that fussed about
[13:50] <BigRedS> actually, I just don't have that much data...
[13:51] <popey> /dev/sdc         22T   13T  8.2T  62% /srv
[13:51] <popey> thats my btrfs volume
[13:51] <rowinggolfer> is btrfs now on a par with zfs (functionality wise, not license etc..)
[13:51] <popey> quite impressed by the reliability of it now
[13:53] <SuperMatt> I've never gotten around to trying btrs, because every time I try to use it, I forget that I can't use it on /boot, get frustrated and then go back to ext4
[13:55] <BigRedS> haha, I love how many things still need a separate /boot. I'm still expecting it to become te norm to have a 2GB disk soldered tothe motherboard for /boot to live on
[13:56] <mgdm> disk? Flash :)
=== p is now known as Guest56396
[13:56] <BigRedS> ah, yeah, I suppose
[13:56] <BigRedS> Oh yeah, we had some HPs (I think) with sd card slot on the board
[14:07] <BigRedS> Is there a synergy-alike that's better for simply conjoining two Linux PCs? I've not tried Synergy for some time, but wondered if there was some more native 'solution'
[14:10] <MartijnVdS> what's synergy? :)
[14:12] <daftykins> the one that forwards kb+mouse input over LAN
[14:16] <rowinggolfer> keylogging heaven.
[14:19] <daftykins> omg verified by visa is such rubbish
[14:19] <daftykins> rowinggolfer: not if you SSH tunnel it =]
[14:30] <BigRedS> ach, we're all friends here anyway
[14:31] <BigRedS> says he with the encrypted filesystem
[14:31] <daftykins> 0o
[14:33] <gord> i think fridays should be ubuntu-uk-synergy-party-friday, where we all connect to an internet synergy server and try and get work done when sharing one virtual mouse and keyboard

[14:47] <Azelphur> don't really wanna move audio, just wanna listen to the mic
[14:48] <brobostigon> pulseaudio could do that, pipe the microphone input on machineA, to speaker output on machineB.
[14:48] <brobostigon> can*
[14:49] <Azelphur> fun
[14:49] <brobostigon> yes.

[15:08] <Azelphur> I used mumble, made it work
[15:28] <gord> doesn't mumble compress the audio with speex? ie, be terrible for music?
[15:28] <Azelphur> that's ok I only want it to listen in and find out when my fire alarm stops going off
[15:29] <gord> oh okay
[15:29] <gord> not concerned about the fire?
[15:29] <gord> i'd be more worried about that
[15:29] <Azelphur> no fire
[15:30] <daftykins> doh, this second NAS didn't come with the screws D:
[15:30] <gord> you don't have a container full of thousands of random screws through years of computer owning?
[15:31] <daftykins> yep
[15:31] <daftykins> not the point though is it
[15:31] <gord> i think that is entirely the point of the container ;P
[15:32] <daftykins> your being facetious is entirely unwelcome
[15:32] <gord> i think i'm helping
[15:33] <daftykins> you're wrong
[15:33] <gord> i don't think thats possible

[15:42] <daftykins> most i've been to have been quite a joke
[15:43] <daftykins> one states (local government) woman kept saying she kept wanting to call me John after the Led Zeppelin drummer given my surname :(
[15:43] <daftykins> i nearly asked if it would help me get the job if i learnt the drums
[15:43] <daftykins> but i got it anyway \o/
[15:43] <daftykins> that was about 4 years ago now :O
[15:44] <gord> i don't think i've ever not gotten a job after an interview, plenty of failed applications but always managed to get the job once i got to the interview part. must be my winning personality/threats of violence
[15:44] <daftykins> could be
[15:45] <daftykins> bet that'd be a different story now though
[15:45] <daftykins> apparently most super mundane jobs locally have 25+ applicants
[15:45] <daftykins> bad time to be an interviewer
[15:46] <gord> yeah probably, haven't actually applied for a job for about 4 years
[15:53] <czajkowski> gord: do you bribe them with your odd sweets
[15:54]  * daftykins starts on another creme egg
[15:56] <popey> ooh, sweets!
[15:56]  * popey gets some
[16:00] <SuperMatt> sweets? This is how my office treated us today https://twitter.com/WCRS_LDN/status/294830796500512769/photo/1
[16:00] <czajkowski> JELLIES!!!!!!!!!!!!
[16:01] <SuperMatt> this is a new weekly thing
[16:01] <SuperMatt> fridays are gonna be totes awesome from now on
[16:05] <daftykins> O_O
[16:05] <daftykins> SuperMatt: i'm applying :D
[16:05] <SuperMatt> I'm afraid I'm the only linux guy the company need
[16:08] <daftykins> i am not this
[16:12]  * TheOpenSourcerer spies wine gums!
[16:12] <TheOpenSourcerer> I had some fruit gums earlier :-)
[16:13]  * brobostigon has jelly babies, :)
[16:14] <TheOpenSourcerer> Ooh
[16:14]  * TheOpenSourcerer notices it is approaching Friday evening.
[16:14] <TheOpenSourcerer> Huuzaahhh
[16:14] <brobostigon> i can have them now, i couldnt because they had artificial colourings and preservatives in them.
[16:14] <TheOpenSourcerer> Beer O'clock thrusts into view
[16:14] <daftykins> are you allergic to those?
[16:14] <brobostigon> :D
[16:15] <brobostigon> daftykins: some, yes.
[16:15] <daftykins> that sucks hard
[16:15] <brobostigon> definatly.
[16:18] <daftykins> glad i don't have to think about what i eat
[16:24] <gord> i saw creme eggs on the shelves like, 1st of january this year. at first i was completely outraged obviously, but then i realized that i can now eat a cream egg so that outrage went away quickly
[16:25] <brobostigon> daftykins: :)
[16:25] <daftykins> gord: same here, i mean why is Easter stuff stocked so early? makes zero sense
[16:26] <daftykins> but then mere seconds after that thought, OM NOM NOM CREME EGGS!
[16:26] <gord> its stocked early because easter stuff is delicious
[16:26] <daftykins> heh
[16:26] <daftykins> maybe they're applying genius supermarket sale techniques
[16:26] <daftykins> people are fat after Christmas and New Year, so in order to beat them to trying to lose that weight in the gym, provide more comfort junk food that they can guiltily stock up on
[16:27] <daftykins> genius plan
[16:28] <gord> i was thinking earlier that the only way supermarkets are going to be able to compete with amazon in the future is if they instigate something like amazons suggestions, ala you bought x, other people who bought x also bought y kind of thing. anyway the end result is that i should be allowed to go snooping through other peoples shopping whilst in the supermarket
[16:29] <daftykins> gord: you can do this by pretending to be a checkout staffer!
[16:39] <dwatkins> some people might consider that to be taking things a bit too far, especially considering some of the hilarious and tragic suggestions Amazon has made over the years
[16:40] <dwatkins> "you bought this book on C++? How about a book about some things a small minority of people do in the bedroom which aren't fit for discussion on an Ubuntu IRC channel?"
[16:43] <Azelphur> Anyone bored feel free to make suggestions on this: http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130125084110AAPXJms
[16:48] <daftykins> dwatkins: how intrigueing
[16:49] <daftykins> trust me it's not picnic being a landlord
[16:49] <daftykins> but that's definitely taking the biscuit and possibly some of the cake too
[16:50] <daftykins> if you've scrutinised your contract, it might be best to officially pursue some action regarding that alarm
[16:52] <Azelphur> daftykins, yea, I'm really starting to get to that point, I've asked him nicely, sent recorded mail, etc
[16:52] <daftykins> Azelphur: does the phone never get answered?
[16:53] <daftykins> you could, although it'd suck, offer to be a key holder on site for the fire alarm in some way i guess
[16:53] <daftykins> but it sounds like they need to be relocated
[16:53] <Azelphur> daftykins, It's only ever answered once, out of around 30 calls.
[16:53] <daftykins> =/
[16:53] <daftykins> that's a joke
[16:54] <Azelphur> yep
[16:54] <Azelphur> think it might have finally stopped, brb going home xD
[16:54] <daftykins> the problem is of course that you have to stay nicey nicey otherwise they can only make it harder for you and you won't want to live there :(
[16:55] <daftykins> zomg Azelphur out of his chair D:
[16:55] <daftykins> historic moment
[16:55] <daftykins> ;)
[17:00] <Azelphur> there we go, back home
[17:01] <Azelphur> yea, I went to my brothers and listened on mumble for it to stop
[17:01] <Azelphur> daftykins: he's doing lots of other unacceptable stuff to, the summary is that the place is in a state of disrepair
[17:02] <Azelphur> right now I got no hot water or heating because the boiler is fucked, having to use electric fan heater to stay warm
[17:02] <daftykins> >_<
[17:02] <Azelphur> so yea, he's no doubt gonna be getting in trouble
[17:02] <daftykins> is there a boiler per property or shared per a #?
[17:02] <Azelphur> per property
[17:03] <daftykins> if you got no headway, you could probably claim some health and safety thing over the fire alarm misuse and noise issue
[17:03] <Azelphur> baring in mind I'm aspergers and noise sensitive, it makes the flat totally untenable
[17:04] <Azelphur> fire alarm goes off I just pick my laptop up and leave pretty much.
[17:04] <Azelphur> even for a normal person it'd be pretty bad, they are commercial grade sirens
[17:04] <daftykins> i used to wake up with a fright every Tuesday morning in Uni halls of residence as the test went off for a few seconds >_<
[17:05] <Azelphur> fun
[17:05] <Azelphur> the longest stint we've had is 6 hours, that one was a little over 2 hours
[17:05] <daftykins> cor la
[17:07] <Laney> no boiler> how long ago did you inform the landlord?
[17:07] <Azelphur> about 2 hours ago, via an answering machine on the "24/7 emergency line"
[17:09] <Laney> i have had good luck with the council's environmental health department before
[17:09] <bigcalm> Afternoon peeps :)
[17:09] <Laney> they'll come round and do a little inspection then light a fire if anything's wrong
[17:09] <Azelphur> fun
[17:10] <daftykins> well at least then, there really *IS* a fire :P
[17:11] <bigcalm> Anybody know if I can buy online with dell but have the invoice handled by my company, or do I have to do such things on the phone?
[17:12] <daftykins> shouldn't cost anything to go through the motions on the site
[17:13] <daftykins> though beware, once a phone number / email is in, the lovely outsourced individuals will be climbing over each other to try and get the sale

[17:55] <aptanet> solarcloud_3srcn, no sign of any wireless settings in the bios on the laptop - I remembered to check when I rebooted :)
[17:56] <daftykins> what kind of wireless settings 0o
[18:09] <solarcloud_3srcn> daftykins: Saw this today :: http://manx.net/tv/mt-tv/watch/52461/chief-minister-briefing-2-  (3mins in)...
[18:14] <solarcloud_3srcn> SuperMatt: As Far As http://t.co/JAwXjoXC :::    .... it's called stodge.

[18:36] <solarcloud_3srcn> aptanet: never under.estimate the power of drop-box to put people in the picture of a bios system.
[18:45] <daftykins> solarcloud_3srcn: ruh-roh
[18:45] <solarcloud_3srcn> daftykins: Take it that's a chortle lol, then ?
[18:46] <daftykins> nah it sounds a bit serious if that presenter is trying to suggest the Channel Islands of Jersey and Guernsey will be annoyed at the IoM's recent actions
[18:46] <solarcloud_3srcn> Unite the clans !!
[18:47] <AlanBell> nigelb: are you in London?
[18:48] <daftykins> i still don't really have a clue what it's all about
[18:49] <daftykins> solarcloud_3srcn: looks like your local news presenters are as annoying as ours
[18:49] <solarcloud_3srcn> It's basically an Americae institute FATCA (not sure of spelling there) .. kicking as$ outta the OECD smaller dominions .. but I must get a paper, Yes.
[18:49] <daftykins> i might have to visit the IoM some day, see what yet another rock is like
[18:49] <daftykins> solarcloud_3srcn: is the TT still held?
[18:50] <solarcloud_3srcn> yep. but accommodation is ike, couchsurfing :: intermitent.
[18:50] <solarcloud_3srcn> **like
[18:50] <daftykins> hehe
[18:51] <daftykins> http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_aboutus1/
[18:52] <daftykins> look how daft ours look
[18:52] <solarcloud_3srcn> daftykins: Have you come across any interesting #-tags on twitter today ??
[18:52] <solarcloud_3srcn> opening...
[18:52] <daftykins> i don't use twitter, i think it's a pile of @!#%^
[18:53] <solarcloud_3srcn> oh Ok .soz ... Well, gargoyles a plenty there, I must say.
[18:53] <daftykins> ^_^
[19:00] <solarcloud_3srcn> daftykins:   mmmh ... Yoga . A by-word for chillout everywhere .. All depends on the teacher of course .. but I see a global need on most channels
[19:00] <solarcloud_3srcn> http://www.channelonline.tv/channelonline_guernseynews/DisplayArticle.asp?ID=503351
[19:00] <daftykins> oh my word
[19:00] <daftykins> the crap they have kids doing now
[19:01] <solarcloud_3srcn> lol
[19:01] <popey> what's wrong with yoga?
[19:01] <daftykins> oh hush
[19:01] <popey> ʘ‿ಠ
[19:02] <solarcloud_3srcn> At least it's in-doors . Think of all of the cross-country double lessons going on today .. I digress, but it is a bettr option, popey.
[19:02] <AlanBell> anyone in London?
[19:02] <daftykins> may help combat obesity? know what else might do that? not carting your chubby kids to school and back on an *island* >_<
[19:02] <daftykins> (in a car)
[19:03] <solarcloud_3srcn> The walk to school is prob.ly the safest part of their day ... except in Lurgan. NI.
[19:03] <popey> When we go away there's a bunch of people who go and do yoga first thing in the morning. they seem better off for it
[19:04] <daftykins> popey: where's that d'you mean?
[19:04] <popey> when we go away for work events
[19:04] <daftykins> ah yeah
[19:04] <popey> like sprints and the Ubuntu Developer Summit
[19:04]  * solarcloud_3srcn thnks popey is omnipotent 
[19:05] <daftykins> i don't think there's anything wrong with it itself, i just don't think primary school kids need peace and to 'de-stress' XD
[19:05] <daftykins> although if they're surrounding themselves with constant noisy technology, perhaps it is of benefit
[19:06] <solarcloud_3srcn> daftykins: I epends how the teacher plays them , as I said.
[19:06] <popey> kids certainly need a way to wind down
[19:06] <solarcloud_3srcn> **depends
[19:06] <popey> reading is good for that
[19:06] <popey> that's one reason why we always read to our kids at bed time
[19:06] <popey> and the telly/computer/ds/ipad go off a while before bed
[19:07] <popey> yoga focusses the mind I guess. ☺
[19:07]  * solarcloud_3srcn says  "Good for the popeys" !!
[19:07] <daftykins> popey: do you practice the no-electronics in the bedroom strategy too?
[19:07] <popey> yeah
[19:07] <solarcloud_3srcn> oooh, that's a bit harsh daftykins
[19:07] <popey> no TV in the kids rooms, no PC
[19:07] <solarcloud_3srcn> ouch !
[19:08] <daftykins> solarcloud_3srcn: no it's very important, these days the kids are snapping themselves nude and sharing to one another >_<
[19:08] <daftykins> gotta clamp down
[19:08] <popey> they can use them in the morning
[19:08] <popey> just not before bed
[19:08] <popey> sophie has just started getting into email
[19:08] <solarcloud_3srcn> right, 'cos in the final analysis, It just makes *you* look bad, right ?
[19:08] <daftykins> dun-dun-duuuun
[19:09] <popey> solarcloud_3srcn: que?
[19:09] <daftykins> solarcloud_3srcn: i find that a very daft statement
[19:09] <daftykins> it's that the kids don't realise the consequences of that kind of thing
[19:09] <popey> yeah, it's funny, lots of kids in her class got ipads / ipod touches for xmas
[19:09] <popey> so they now have email addresses
[19:09] <popey> she's been off sick a couple of days, and got emails from her schoolfriends wishing her well
[19:09] <daftykins> crikey
[19:09] <popey> very cute
[19:09] <daftykins> what age is that?
[19:09] <popey> and yes, I saw one of the mails had a webcam photo attached
[19:10] <popey> 9
[19:10] <daftykins> crikey
[19:10] <popey> yeah
[19:10] <popey> when we heard other kids getting ipads we were somewhat dismayed
[19:10] <popey> peer pressure
[19:10] <daftykins> oh my word, super slow archive extract, i detect disk issues
[19:10] <popey> but we have loads of devices in the house so they don't need their own
[19:10] <daftykins> yeah, next they'll be after the 'new model'
[19:10] <popey> yeah
[19:10] <popey> not having that going on here ☺
[19:11] <daftykins> :D
[19:11] <popey> although she is using a nexus 7 ☺
[19:11] <popey> shared one
[19:11]  * daftykins pats 3 year old smartphone
[19:11] <daftykins> no contracts for me.
[19:11] <popey> me either
[19:12] <solarcloud_3srcn> It's like watching two Old clucking hen's, you two ^_^
[19:12] <popey> hah
[19:12] <daftykins> well i'm far from having kids but i find the issues surrounding their upbringing and technology quite interesting :)
[19:12] <popey> yeah, me too
[19:12] <popey> i worry about these things
[19:13] <popey> i caught sophie looking at a safe video on youtube recently
[19:13] <daftykins> treading that fine line between giving them what they *need* versus what might affect them in relation to their peers
[19:13] <popey> but the comments were less than savoury
[19:13] <daftykins> :( all too common that one yeah
[19:13] <popey> i hear there are browser extensions to block comments
[19:13] <popey> might install those
[19:13] <daftykins> iirc you have some website blocking in place at home, don't you?
[19:13] <popey> she doesn't need to see that crap
[19:13] <popey> only the usual opendns blocking
[19:14] <daftykins> ah do they have a blacklist?
[19:14] <daftykins> or just in using their DNS?
[19:14] <popey> yeah, but i never maintain it
[19:14] <popey> yeah
[19:14] <popey> i have never seen anything untoward
[19:14] <popey> and I keep an eye on things
[19:14] <popey> we have sophies email set to forward every mail she recives to mum
[19:15] <popey> will turn that off in a few years, but not yet
[19:15] <daftykins> *nod*
[19:15] <popey> sam doesnt have mail yet, he's only 6
[19:16] <daftykins> i'm pretty surprised at some of the aptitude of younger kids that are appearing online on even, freenode here lately
[19:16] <daftykins> i imagine how different it would've been having such easy access to further information on topics i was interested in back then
[19:17] <daftykins> always on broadband to get it too, rather than the classic driving your parents mad with big dial-up phonebills :D
[19:17] <popey> heh, yeah
[19:18] <popey> my mum had never used a computer before 2 years ago
[19:18] <popey> her very first internet connection was 20Mb broadband :D
[19:18] <popey> she will never know the pain of dial-up
[19:18] <solarcloud_3srcn> :-$:-/O:-)    can we talk about halflife 1 now ?
[19:19] <popey> also, my mother in law has an ipad
[19:19] <popey> she got it as a retirement present
[19:19] <daftykins> heh
[19:19] <popey> it's helped her stay in contact (mostly fb but also email) with people
[19:19] <popey> (she just pinged me which is what made me think of it)
[19:19] <daftykins> one of my clients got given one by one of his directorships recently, for 'reading notes on' because they *totally* didn't have laptops already
[19:20] <popey> haha
[19:20] <popey> thats the "its for doing my homework" excuse ☺
[19:20] <daftykins> :D
[19:20] <popey> i used that one in 1983
[19:20] <daftykins> he groaned as much as me, but he's loving it now
[19:20] <popey> got me a Sinclair Spectrum
[19:20] <daftykins> =]
[19:22] <solarcloud_3srcn> popey, 'ave you tried M.U.L.E  on it yet ?? (S-Spectrum) ??
[19:46] <popey> nope
[19:55]  * solarcloud_3srcn wonders if popey even knows what SWars M.U.L.E. actually is , mmmmhpf !
[19:57] <popey> nope ☺
[20:00] <solarcloud_3srcn> oh well .. perhaps this will help .. http://www.worldofmule.net/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=30 also http://www.worldofspectrum.org/forums/showthread.php?p=198568#post198568
[21:01] <solarcloud_3srcn> Man , I'm so tired .. I'm sweating tears !  .. Yesterday was the Alternative sock day. Today is the Wet insoles o' shoes Day,    but ya know; I can't complain. :::::::: Anyone gotta Ubuntu rash to itch ???
[21:19] <nigelb> AlanBell: In cabridge now. won't be back in London until the weeek after next, I'm afraid.
[21:50] <AlanBell> ok
[22:48] <directhex> CS 1.6 on Linux is now official, no hax needed to run it
[22:51] <brobostigon> CS ?
[22:52] <Aivaras> Counter Strike from steam.
[22:52] <brobostigon> ah.
[22:52] <Aivaras> I just saw that it is on Beta now.
[22:52] <Aivaras> http://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1766803738391201366?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=t.co
[22:55] <daftykins> for whoever plays that ;)
[22:58] <directhex> 4th most popular game on steam
[22:58] <directhex> 40k people playing it right now
[22:58] <directhex> more popular than CS:S or CS:GO
[23:09] <directhex> bah
[23:12] <timp_> Hi, I have managed to get ubuntu server running on my macbook pro, but cannot get desktop up.
[23:12] <timp_> Can I upgrade from server to desktop?
[23:12] <timp_> What is the package I need?
[23:12] <directhex> timp_, yeah, just install the ubuntu-desktop package
[23:12] <timp_> yay, thanks
[23:13] <timp_> Oh, what about wireless?
[23:18] <timp_> I have two macs, this one, wireless and the other booted with ubuntu server
[23:18] <timp_> If I connect them with an ethernet cable can I get to the outside world?
[23:45] <directhex> maybe there *is* some incompatibility right now for people who don't own HL1 as well as CS
[23:45] <directhex> i just did a reinstall of CS only without HL installed, and it's behaving differently to installing CS with HL already installed
[23:46] <directhex> gah
[23:46] <daftykins> hrmm
[23:46] <daftykins> didn't Windows based Steam get around that by having a base package?
[23:47] <directhex> daftykins, yeah, but something's changed since this afternoon
[23:47] <daftykins> ah-har
[23:47] <daftykins> i know what you mean about CS 1.6 btw, i just more meant shocking that people *do* still play it
[23:47] <directhex> i have a sad CEO who can't get it to run
[23:48] <daftykins> CEO 0o
[23:48] <daftykins> i'm seeing an update on HL1 0o
[23:49] <daftykins> 400MB!
[23:49] <directhex> daftykins, like i said, stuff has changed around!
[23:49] <daftykins> yeah my surprise was my verification
[23:51] <daftykins> amusingly the Windows client is seizing up refusing to play ball, it has that update paused and won't do anything about it
[23:51] <daftykins> good times
[23:51] <directhex> daftykins, do you own HL1?
[23:51] <daftykins> yeah
[23:52] <directhex> oddness
[23:52] <daftykins> ah
[23:52] <daftykins> i hit pause, instead of resume
[23:52] <daftykins> then resume, then it was done instantly
