[00:00] <blami> bekks: in case of 50 I see some improvement
[00:00] <demondin> okay, would it be worth it you think? im kinda just doing it to test it out..
[00:00] <bekks> blami: Me dont. I'll just use copy and paste for the relevant contents of those three files.
[00:00] <luigi> Hi guys
[00:00] <luigi> Anyone have any problems?
[00:00] <luigi> I'm very bored and willing to help out
[00:01] <F3Speech> demondin: you could move the partisions about and install on a new partision while saving your old but tbh if your new easier to back them up insead of choosing wrong option and losing them
[00:01] <demondin> back them up to my external?
[00:01] <F3Speech> demondin: if you just want to test use a live version on usb or cd
[00:02] <F3Speech> then you pc isnt changed but you get to have a look around reboot will take u back to windows
[00:03] <demondin> well it's really not like im going to be using my old laptop a lot
[00:03] <demondin> and im just kind of crious
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:05] <blami> demondin: backup three times, think twice and install after that ;)
[00:06] <demondin> im so new to backing up and all of this stuff, i feel dumb
[00:07] <F3Speech> got to start somewhere :) even if it just copying them to a usb stick
[00:08] <demondin> ive got a 1tb external harddrive...should i back everything up? or just things i care about
[00:09] <dbrom> id back it up
[00:09] <frooh> hey guys, I'm fiddling with two factor auth in xscreensaver and xscreensaver is complaining that it can't find my gnome-keyring
[00:10] <frooh> does anyone have any clue what that has to do with anything?
[00:10] <frooh> (to be clear, I cannot log in at all)
[00:11] <frooh> actually, two factor is a red herring, it only seems to have anything to do with the yubikey stuff I'm messing with
[00:15] <kylescottmcgill> frooh: gnome-keyring holds all passwords stored in Ubuntu, so yubikey will need to be able to find this in order for it to work properly
[00:15] <fellipe> hi, does ubuntu remove files in /tmp while system  is running?
[00:20] <bigbadben> I installed Kubuntu and it has horrible dual monitor support is there anyway I can install ubuntu again, if I just install the ubuntu desktop will I get the ubuntu software center, along with all the other programs ubuntu has?
[00:21] <Squarepy> bigbadben, ubuntu desktop? you mean unity?
[00:21] <Squarepy> or the full installer
[00:21] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: ok, so it wants me to have a pkcs11 file in my keyring cache; other non-X11 things (sudo, login) work with the yubikey
[00:21] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: thoughts?
[00:22] <bigbadben> squarepy, 'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop'
[00:22] <ozzloy> my right alt doesn't work in ubuntu 12.04, how do i troubleshoot this?
[00:24] <angel56> ozzloy: used to be able to define keys in .Xmodmap, but I don't know if ubuntu even recognizes that file anymore
[00:25] <kslater> does anyone know if 12.04 supports some sort of automatic display sensing / switching?
[00:26] <ikonia> kslater: xorg is dynamic in any ubuntu version now
[00:26] <unknown_> where can i upload a screen shot?
[00:27] <ikonia> any image hosting website
[00:27] <kslater> ikonia: I guess that means I need to read what that means specifically.
[00:27] <ikonia> kslater: it means it will attempt to detect your video hardware dynamically
[00:28] <kslater> I had to use the nvidia X server settings application to light up my other display
[00:28] <unknown_> thanks ikonia
[00:28] <dr_willis> kslater:  in 12.10 it enables my 2nd monitor when its plugged in. nvidia/twinview
[00:28] <kslater> what I would *like* to have happen is when my laptop lid is closed, but it's in the docking station, to drive the two external monitors
[00:29] <kslater> and when I take it out to drive the laptop LCD
[00:29] <kslater> that would be really great to get working.
[00:29] <ikonia> how are you connecting 2 external monitors from a laptop
[00:29] <ikonia> kslater: that should be possible
[00:29] <kslater> I have a docking station that supports it
[00:29] <ikonia> so it will depend on how the docking station works in terms of linux support

[00:34] <unknown_> it is all in the screen shots
[00:34] <unknown_> the details
[00:34] <bekks> unknown_: Just explain it. All the details.

[00:34] <ubottu> unknown_: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."

=== mohamad is now known as Guest93115
[00:35] <unknown_> if you see this again try rebooting the computer
[00:35] <kslater> it's weird how Unity makes the mouse stick at the border of the combined (TwinView) display. Maybe I should only have the side menu on the left most lcd panel.
[00:36] <unknown_> Unity is causing me alot of proms. too it seems

[00:37] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: I looked online and think it might be solvable with a modification to the /etc/xdg/autostart/gnome-keyring-pkcs11.desktop file

[00:43] <kylescottmcgill> frooh: yeah i had similar symptoms these guys had, im using another Window Manager, which doesnt use gnome, so the daemon wasnt being started when logging in, i had to attach it to a autostart.sh file, to make sure it spawned correctly, which fixed everything for me
[00:43] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: ok, so you're saying when the wm starts you run "/usr/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=pkcs11" ? (I'm using awesomewm)
[00:44] <kylescottmcgill> im using awesome as well
[00:44] <Tex_Nick> dr_willis maybe we should all switch to android phones ... cause i never hear you complaining about problems ;)
[00:44] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: nice! are you starting from lightdm (or gdm) ?
[00:44] <kylescottmcgill> gdm, lightdm kept giving me a Low Res GFX error thing
[00:44] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: I haven't gone to the effort of setting up a script to run other programs, if you can tell me how to do that I'd apprecite it
[00:44] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: yeah, same here
[00:45] <kylescottmcgill> i will paste my config
[00:45] <frooh> woot
[00:45] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: thanks :D
[00:45] <kylescottmcgill> frooh: actually give me about 5 mins, i will setup a proper gist with what you need and where etc
[00:46] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: awesome, thanks so much
[00:47] <unknown_> this is the error i got (unity-applications-deamon crashed with signal 7)
[00:47] <unknown_> can anyone tell me what that means??
[00:48] <unknown_> i am running ubuntu 12.04.1 x64
[00:49] <unknown_> i get the error soon as i boot up
[00:51] <kylescottmcgill> frooh: have you got GTK running properly as well?
[00:51] <frooh> kylescottmcgill: I... think so?
[00:51] <frooh> it's themed anyway
[00:51] <kylescottmcgill> so when you open nautalis or something, its pretty?
[00:51] <kylescottmcgill> ok cool
[00:52] <unknown_> Can anyone tell what this means? (unity-applications-deamon crashed with signal 7) i am running ubuntu 12.04.1 x64
[00:52] <dr_willis> unknown_:  this is a clean install?
[00:52] <frooh> https://github.com/frioux/dotfiles/blob/master/gtkrc-2.0
[00:52] <frooh> that's all I did
[00:52] <unknown_> dr_willis yes
[00:52] <kylescottmcgill> ok then its actually only two files then you need
[00:53] <kylescottmcgill> https://gist.github.com/4448970
[00:53] <unknown_> dr_willis this happens every time i boot up
[00:53] <dr_willis> unknown_:  with all these weird errors id have to wonder if somthing was not messed up during ther install, or a bad cd/burn/download, or some hw related issues.
[00:53] <kylescottmcgill> also, inside that .xinitrc file you can have other applets
[00:54] <kylescottmcgill> eg: bluetooth-applet gnome-sound-applet
[00:54] <unknown_> dr_willis I check the cd and it passed with no errors but yes i think it may be that as well is there any log files we can look at that may give more info?
[00:55] <dr_willis> unknown_:  /var/log has all logs
[00:55] <dr_willis> unknown_:  id try a 12.10 install.
[00:55] <unknown_> what log would be most helpful right now?
[00:56] <Bino1710> does anyone know how to change the back round image for the log in screen
[00:56] <unknown_> oh this may be helpful i used the altenate install cd because i wanted to encrypt my install with lvm
[00:57] <dr_willis> Bino1710:  for lightdm? it auto changes to the one the user has selected. or you can edddit the image in /usr/share/backgrounds (i recall) or edit the lightdm configs
[00:57] <dr_willis> unknown_:  i never use lvm.  never neeeded it on a home system
[00:57] <Bino1710> ok thanks for the info
[00:58] <kylescottmcgill> lvm?
[00:58] <unknown_> if i upgrade to 12.10 will my lvm stay in place?
[00:58] <dr_willis> Bino1710:  theres some tweak tools out fore it also
[00:58] <ece> bought an hp g62 notebook used today because had ubuntu and talked em into $150. need to do an OS upgrade and the auto upgrade failed since its an older build
[00:58] <kylescottmcgill> oh that lvm, sorry i thought that was in reference to lightdm
[00:58] <dr_willis> unknown_:  if its a clean install why does it matter?  why do you really need a lvm?
[00:59] <dr_willis> ece:  with a used computer. i would suggest a clean reinstall anyway for 'security' reasons
[00:59] <unknown_> i always encrypt my linux as i have a laptop and i always worry about theft
[00:59] <ece> yes
[01:00] <Gavin_v> hello everybody, i upgrade my ubuntu from 12.04 to 12.10, but now all of the close button and minixiae botton missing
[01:00] <seednode> Eh, too bad I don't have data important enough to back up
[01:00] <seednode> Or protect
[01:00] <dr_willis> Gavin_v:  make a new user see if they have the same issue as a test case.
[01:01] <dr_willis> if a new user works fine. then it points to a user setting issue
[01:02] <Gavin_v> dr_jesus, i've tried, the new user works fine
[01:02] <dr_willis> then it points to a user setting issue. id reset the problem users settings ;)

[01:03] <unknown_> i will try 12.10

[01:03] <dr_willis> ubuntu-tweak used to have the feature
[01:03] <unknown_> thanks guys for the help
[01:04] <TheLordOfTime> dr_willis, there's always brainstorm to propose new things/.
[01:04] <GeorgeJ> Hello folks!
[01:04] <unknown_> i will let you know what happens
[01:04] <dr_willis> TheLordOfTime:  yea. and ive rarely ever seen any get implemented
[01:04] <Gavin_v> dr_jesus, which default tool shall i use?
[01:04] <karol__> Hi all
[01:05] <dr_willis> Gavin_v:  i just move my config files/dirs to a backup dir then log out/back in
[01:05] <GeorgeJ> I've create a 100G LVM logical volume and formatted it as ext4. df -h reports the partition as having 99G, of which 188M is used and 94G available, where's the rest?
[01:05] <Gavin_v> dr_jesus, thanks
[01:06] <dr_willis> 5% of ext2/3/4 is reserved for root/file recovery. tuneable via the tune2fs command GeorgeJ
[01:06] <GeorgeJ> There's nothing on the partition, so I guess 188M is how much ext4 needs for its structures, but what about the extra 5GB that are missing
[01:06] <GeorgeJ> dr_willis: Aha! Fascinating! Thank you!
[01:07] <dr_willis> for data drives i set that to 0%   system drives i may set it to 1%
[01:07] <dr_willis> on a 3TB /    1% is a lot ;)
[01:07] <GeorgeJ> Hmm, why set it to 0%? Will that no hinder file recovery
[01:07] <GeorgeJ> ?
[01:07] <GeorgeJ> Data drives can still fuck up.
[01:08] <dr_willis> for my video data external storage. i dont worrrry about recovery
[01:08] <dr_willis> i have backups
[01:08] <GeorgeJ> Hmm, that's a great point!
[01:08] <dr_willis> they are most always 98% full anyway
[01:08] <Gavin_v> great~
[01:10] <GeorgeJ> dr_willis: What option is it I need to modify with tune2fs? -m?
[01:11] <dr_willis>  -m0 i think.. check the man pages
[01:11] <kylescottmcgill> what do you call the command line operators ( && << ; ) i want to see if there is an exhaustive list somewhere
[01:11] <dr_willis> it can do it several ways
[01:12] <kylescottmcgill> do they have a name? operators isnt the correct terminology according to google
[01:12] <dr_willis> kylescottmcgill:  most decent bash guides will covee them
[01:12] <mrj> I'm trying to install a PPA on a minimal install, I just need the add-apt-repository command to work. I installed python-software-properties but it just tells me "the program add-apt-repository" can be found in the following packages: pythonsoftwareproperties & softwarepropertiescommon
[01:12] <dr_willis>  << are redirection  operators..
[01:12] <dr_willis>  && and &  are job controll
[01:13] <kylescottmcgill> dr_willis: ty, so they have different names, not lumped into one named convention, i will just try find some guides :)
[01:14] <mrj> well nevermind.. it let me apt get them anyway

[01:58] <ezrafree> is there any easy way to just reinstall all of my X window system? it's hosed and the computer won't boot into X... I currently have like gnome/compiz, if that matters any...
[01:58] <jessejames> Good evening everyone
[01:59] <erreur> helooo
[01:59] <ezrafree> or any way to do a clean dist-upgrade or something? i'd really love to get my box running again
[01:59] <jjgalvez__> looking for help with the RTL-8185 wireless card, it recently (yesterday or today) started working very very slowly. Not sure how to troubleshoot it
[01:59] <ezrafree> jjgalvez__: are you in close proximity to other houses/apartments/buildings?
[02:00] <ezrafree> jjgalvez__: could it be a matter of channel interference?
[02:00] <jjgalvez__> ezrafree: no more then it used to be, also other wireless computers in the same area seem to be working just fine
[02:01] <ezrafree> jjgalvez__: yes, but.. the other networks can change which channel they run on at any time
[02:01] <ezrafree> there are programs which can scan wifi channels, not sure of any offhand for linux though
[02:02] <jessejames> Hi, Linux newbi here, can anyone tell me who to beef up my security on Linux so I can protect myself online ?
[02:02] <rrva__> jessejames: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Security
[02:03] <jjgalvez__> ezrafree: I am on channel 11, the only other network on channel 11 shows up at 29% signal strength. The other networks around me are on channels 6, and a couple on 1. suggest any specific channel I should try?
[02:03] <jessejames> thanks rrva
[02:03] <ezrafree> jjgalvez__: the only suggestion is "the least used channel possible"
[02:04] <ezrafree> jjgalvez__: but it sounds like you diagnosed the channels already, so i guess that's not the issue
[02:04] <ezrafree> jessejames: protect yourself from anything in particular?
[02:04] <jjgalvez__> ezrafree: worth a try, I'll give it a try and report back
[02:05] <micmic> ciao
[02:06] <jessejames> hey ravv you there still ?
[02:06] <mcsx3> Good Evening! Everyone. Can anybody here helpme with a little prob? thx. I'm trying to use a ZTE MF180 broadband G3 USB dongle on Unbuntu 12.10. I've found on the Web some solutions, but noone has worked.
[02:07] <ezrafree> jessejames: nope they left
[02:07] <jessejames> ok thanks, can u give me some advice ezrafree ?

=== richard is now known as Guest12030
[02:13] <ezrafree> jessejames: that's not very specific, have you tried googling things like "how to secure ubuntu" yet?
[02:15] <ezrafree> jessejames: that said, some of the usual ways of securing a box (whether server or desktop) would include firewalling, intrusion protection, things like that
=== root_ is now known as Macscroge
[02:15] <jessejames> Yes I have but I'm new to linux so I was looking for someone more experienced to advise me
[02:20] <Tex_Nick> !virus | jessejames
[02:20] <ubottu> jessejames: Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus
[02:20] <mega1> i want to add a user with a home dir in the drive sda6
[02:20] <chiques_> Are there any recorded key logger malware instances for historical Ubuntu versions?
[02:21] <jessejames> Yes i'm aware of that but can other users hack my pc from online ?
[02:21] <jessejames> @tex_nick
[02:21] <ikonia> chiques_: ubuntu has not been released with key loggers or malware
[02:21] <Tex_Nick> jessejames : as far as online privacy ... bout the only thing you might worry about would be browser cookies used to track you
[02:22] <Klinx> chiques_, nope, nothing
[02:22] <jessejames> hmmm so there is notting to worry about ?
[02:22] <chiques_> ikonia, I'm referring to any "trojan" or "hijacking" type of programs for the intent of stealing a users' log information.
[02:22] <Klinx> altough there IS still a possibility, if the main server got compromised.
[02:23] <ikonia> chiques_: there is nothing been released as part of ubuntu, of course these programs exist
[02:23] <Tex_Nick> jessejames : well at the present time ... linux is practically the safest OS on the market
[02:23] <jessejames> really waw, thanks tex_nick
[02:24] <chiques_> ikonia, I understand this is not part of the Ubuntu release but I'm just curious of these attempts are caught by the Ubuntu developers
[02:24] <ikonia> chiques_: well, seeing as the ubuntu developers have control over what they release.....there has not been anything, because they control what is released.
[02:24] <Tex_Nick> jessejames : you're welcome
[02:25] <chiques_> ikonia, so who addresses security holes?
[02:25] <jessejames> how do you message me directly by the way ?
[02:25] <ikonia> chiques_: either the ubuntu team or the package upstream team, depending on where/what the issue is
[02:25] <NeoColossus1020_> Is there a way to pass multiple commands to apt-get? Ex: sudo apt-get -y autoclean, autoremove; instead of doing sudo apt-get autoclean; sudo apt-get autoremove
[02:28] <chiques_> ikonia, How does this security team know what to patch?
[02:28] <ikonia> security alerts
[02:29] <ikonia> chiques_: is there something your trying to resolve/understand here /
[02:29] <mega1> in ubuntu server12.04 how do i add a user with home dir on another partition
[02:30] <ikonia> mega1: -d /where/you/want/home
[02:31] <nards> hello
[02:31] <mega1> will it create the folder for me
[02:32] <ikonia> mega1: -m will create,
[02:32] <Tex_Nick> jessejames : to chat privately with someone , depending on what client you use ... right click on their nick and choose "Open Dialog Window" or similar ... it's usually considered proper protocol to ask first though ... if that was what you were asking
[02:32] <chiques_> ikonia, I'm just wondering where the stop gap or the alarm is sounded when applications coming from Ukrainian or Chinese sources (like in Windows).
[02:32] <ikonia> chiques_: it doesn't work like that
[02:32] <chiques_> ikonia, Referrring to the book Worm
[02:33] <ikonia> chiques_: those applications coming from china/ukrain don't work the same way as on windows platforms
[02:33] <ikonia> they are not a concern

[02:35] <kashkraft> Hello World!
[02:35] <kashkraft> I'm attempting to compile a driver in Ubuntu for the Nexus 7
[02:36] <kashkraft> and Kconfig has warped my mind into mush
[02:36] <Tex_Nick> you can type a few letters of the persons nick, then hit tab ... that would do jessejames, though ... i backspace and then add the colon ... don't know why i do it  .. funny you ask ;-)
[02:36] <ikonia> got a real problem ?
[02:36] <ikonia> rather than some rambling about your mind being mush
[02:36] <kashkraft> When I compile, I'm receiving undefined variable warnings, but the variables should be defined from Kconfig, at least the file appears to define them.
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[02:37] <ikonia> kashkraft: may not be defined in a reference
[02:38] <kashkraft> This is my first time sifting through source to debug a compile error. I spent hours googling yesterday. So, with that out of the way...
[02:38] <kashkraft> Does Makefile automatically find Kconfig?
[02:38] <ikonia> why do you keep going on about kconfig ?
[02:39] <jessejames> Tex_Nick, lol
[02:39] <kashkraft> Because it's the only place I know of to look. Like I said, I'm new to debugging source code compile errors. It's the only file that has the lines to define the variables that are throwing warnings.
[02:40] <ikonia> kashkraft: I'd suggest taking this to the #ubuntu-arm channel with people who are using the nexus platform with ubuntu to see if there are known/common errors
[02:40] <Tex_Nick> jessejames : tis hard to teach an old dog new tricks ;-)
[02:41] <ikonia> Tex_Nick: you appear to be having a private conversation with jessejames in public
[02:41] <ikonia> Tex_Nick: can you please take it to your private message window
[02:41] <kashkraft> This is a known error that I'm trying to sort out. I'm looking for an explanation of Kconfig so I can understand what's happening. It is a known issue listed.
[02:41] <ikonia> kashkraft: if it's a known error, what is the solution
[02:41] <m_> Hi! People
[02:41] <m_> can anybody help me with a little prob?

[02:49] <kashkraft> Good evening gentlemen. I'm attempting to compile the BCM4330 driver from source on Ubuntu and running into undefined variable warnings. This is a known issue (https://code.google.com/p/bcmon/issues/detail?id=8) that I'm attempting to fix. I'm new to compiling source code, however from tracing the variables they should be defined through the file Kconfig. My first question (apologies, I did Google): does Makefile automatically load Kconfig? It has the
[02:49] <kashkraft> calls (CONFIG_BCM4330), but the variables are left undefined. Any help or education is greatly appreciated :)
[02:49] <Beast> Makes me wonder what I'm compiling.

Not sure how to tackle that.
[02:54] <subcool> whats the deal with chrome? Flash is supposed to be stock.
[02:54] <subcool> why is facebook telling me i HAVE to update?
[02:55] <mega1> ok so i would use adduser mega1 -d /dev/sda6/mega1 -m mega1
[02:56] <SonikkuAmerica> HowdyDoody: Did you try boot-repair? That might put a bootloader entry where you need it
[02:56] <SonikkuAmerica> [ sudo apt-get install boot-repair ]
[02:56] <HowdyDoody> ok, I will try it.

[02:58] <ubottu> SonikkuAmerica, please see my private message
[02:58] <NeoColossus1020_>  Is there a way to pass multiple commands to apt-get? Ex: sudo apt-get -y (autoclean && autoremove); that way I don't have to do: sudo apt-get -y autoclean; sudo apt-get -y autoremove
[02:58] <Beast> lol
[02:59] <subcool> SonikkuAmerica, thank you..
[02:59] <SonikkuAmerica> NeoColossus1020_: Put an && as follows, for example, to perform that function:
[03:00] <SonikkuAmerica> [ sudo apt-get -y autoclean && sudo apt-get -y autoremove ]
[03:00] <Tex_Nick> subcool : ffmpeg has been a standard for years ... i think it's deprecated now though ... you can still install it though ... this isn't the channel for that sort of thing rhough :)
[03:00] <HowdyDoody> SonikkuAmerica: Strange,  --> E: Unable to locate package boot-repair      Tire a _      E: Unable to locate package boot_repair
[03:01] <subcool> Tex_Nick, thanks - just looking for a reference
[03:01] <NeoColossus1020_> So there's no way to pass both parameters (auto-clean && autoremove) to the same apt-get command?

[03:02] <phssssssssss> does the latetst ubuntu come with tv viewer app ?

[03:05] <subcool> i have to be the only person who doesnt know why flash has to be updated on crhome..

[03:06] <subcool> SonikkuAmerica, ugh- ok. than why is it complaining that i have to update it, isnt i automatic?

[03:07] <subcool> Tex_Nick, thanks. ill wiggle it- if i have to, ill just go back to my XP machine. :/
[03:07] <subcool> i havent had much luck with media editing on linux
[03:08] <SonikkuAmerica> subcool: Interesting, stock with Chrome but not Rekonq -- but anyway dr_willis is probably onto something.
[03:08] <Transhumanist> I am trying to PXE boot Ubuntu 12.10 desktop and Xubuntu 12.10 desktop on my Toshiba Portege M200. Both load the graphical installer, but once I get to the "check you're plugged into power and the Internet then click continue" part, clicking continue makes the installer hang there. I can quit it and boot into the live CD, but that's all.
[03:08] <Transhumanist> Any thoughts?
[03:09] <Tex_Nick> subcool : ffmpeg is still a powerful tool ... runs on windoze & linux
[03:09] <subcool> SonikkuAmerica, i remember reading that Chrome has it stock, and chromium it doesnt.
[03:09] <SonikkuAmerica> subcool: Chrome has Flash stock, yes. I misunderstood.
[03:10] <SonikkuAmerica> subcool: I'm not too sure myself. I dumped Ubuntu entirely for Windoze Ate some time ago.
[03:11] <subcool> lol - i have win8
[03:11] <subcool> its ok.
[03:11] <SonikkuAmerica> subcool: And of course I have no qualms for autoupdating Flash.
[03:11] <SonikkuAmerica> subcool: On 8 that is
[03:11] <srwood> Transhumanist  You installing 64 bit or 32?
[03:11] <subcool> im really getting tired of these stupid updates
[03:11] <HowdyDoody> SonikkuAmerica: boot-repair is now asking for [dmraid] to be installed.   I do NOT have any raid disks.   I do have lvm2, though.
[03:11] <Transhumanist> srwood: 32bit
[03:11] <SonikkuAmerica> HowdyDoody: I would suggest booting from a Live CD then
[03:12] <subcool> SonikkuAmerica, im not having much luck with avconv on apt- but.. like i said. im about ot just goto win. i have having ot configure EVERYTHING for somethig so simple.
[03:12] <srwood> Hmm  I've had probs with 64 on my toshiba but 32 works great.
[03:12] <subcool> like updating flash.. :/
[03:12] <Transhumanist> I'm downloading the alternate installer now - maybe it's due to a lack of RAM (only 512 mb)
[03:13] <SonikkuAmerica> subcool: Same reason I dumped Ubuntu. Still, Linux (especially 64-bit) is tough to tailor to specific needs. But it's always been like that
[03:13] <srwood> yikes.  I have 6 gigs/
[03:13] <dr_willis> not really had any flash issues here on 64bit.. other then the smurf syndrome
[03:13] <ikonia> 64 bit is not tough at all
[03:13] <SonikkuAmerica> dr_willis: The ... smurf syndrome?
[03:13] <Transhumanist> Windows 8 was a nightmare for me
[03:13] <dr_willis> not had any issues i could blame on 64bit either
[03:13] <srwood> driver issues on 64
[03:13] <ikonia> windows has nothing to do with this channel
[03:13] <Transhumanist> I've had things run pretty much flawlessly on all my Ubuntu installs
[03:14] <dr_willis> SonikkuAmerica:  blue people in videos
[03:14] <srwood> hardware dependent
[03:14] <WeThePeople> can somebody check their .ICEauthority to see if it is set to 0600 and not 0644
[03:14] <SonikkuAmerica> ikonia: More for me in particular... just upgraded from 32- to 64-
[03:14] <SonikkuAmerica> dr_willis: lol
[03:14] <ikonia> SonikkuAmerica: you can't upgrade from 32 to 64
[03:14] <ikonia> SonikkuAmerica: you need to do a clean install
[03:14] <SonikkuAmerica> ikonia: That's what I did. *facepalms* Oops
[03:15] <SonikkuAmerica> ikonia: I clean installed 64
[03:15] <SonikkuAmerica> To me 64 bits seems like a new can of worms to rot, but I digress
[03:15] <Transhumanist> I'd just like to note that I installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my girlfriend's laptop after she had problem after problem with Windows 7 and poor performance, and she now loves Ubuntu. ;)
[03:16] <dr_willis> new? its been around for several years
[03:16] <ikonia> SonikkuAmerica: it's exactly the same techniques as 32bit
[03:16] <Transhumanist> eh, there's nothing wrong with 64-bit Ubuntu mate
[03:16] <SonikkuAmerica> dr_willis: Well yeah, new to me (I had this 32-bit dino from like 2001)
[03:16] <dr_willis> i think linux 64bit is older then windows 64bit by some time also.
[03:17] <dr_willis> i basically only use 64bit ubuntu. with few issues.
[03:17] <n0hx> so im having sound issues in firefox, like music players won't play, any ideas what that could be?
[03:17] <ikonia> there are specific hardware vendors that will not release 64bit closed source drivers, this is a very small group
[03:17] <SonikkuAmerica> Transhumanist: Ubuntu love, eh? lol But that's weird with the installer hanging.
[03:17] <dr_willis> and none i can blame on the 64bit part
[03:17] <SonikkuAmerica> dr_willis: I personally fared better with 32
[03:18] <wad> Okay, I give up. Can someone clue me how to tell Chromium to run applets?
[03:18] <Transhumanist> The installer hanging on my 2004 era laptop with various broken parts and 512mb of RAM when the installer requirs 1.5 times that? Not weird at all. I thought I'd ask if anybody had some tips though. :)
[03:18] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: They don't run at all? They should
[03:18] <dr_willis> SonikkuAmerica:  but you sayd you havent used 64bit m uch.. ;) i have
[03:18] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: *facepalms* What kind? CWS? Java? ...
[03:19] <wad> Java applets, sorry. I just realized that it's probably because Chromium can't find my version of java (which I installed manually). Any idea how to tell Chromium where my java is?
[03:19] <SonikkuAmerica> dr_willis: I've done both versions of Ubuntu (both hard install and Wubi) and 32 performed better than 64, I think however the reasons are obvious.
[03:19] <SonikkuAmerica> dr_willis: Such as: Core 2
[03:20] <cheebu> hi all... happy new year!!!... I have a Radeon HD 6470M Graphics card are there drivers for it on ubuntu
[03:20] <cheebu> 12.04
[03:20] <Transhumanist> But 64-bit architectures are DIFFERENT to 32-bit ones. To run 32-bit stuff on 64-bit machines requires workarounds. It always has. Do a quick google search for problems running 32-bit applications on 64-bit Windows and you might realise attacking Linux for 32-bit apps not always running flawlessly on 64-bit distros is kind of... STUPID.
[03:20] <Transhumanist> happy new year cheebu :)
[03:21] <SonikkuAmerica> Transhumanist: I've always gotten 64-bit stuff for 64
[03:21] <SonikkuAmerica> and 32 for 23
[03:21] <SonikkuAmerica> O.o
[03:21] <SonikkuAmerica> *32
[03:21] <SonikkuAmerica> 23-bit machinery... not even once.
[03:22] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: Can you find a Java plugin in CWS?
[03:22] <wad> CWS?
[03:23] <SonikkuAmerica> Chrome Web Store, sorry
[03:23] <wad> ah
[03:23] <wad> Well, I need to run a specific version of Java.
[03:23] <SonikkuAmerica> (That would be akin to christening Google Play Store GPS! lol)
[03:23]  * wad is currently looking around in menus
[03:23] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: Hmmm...
[03:24]  * SonikkuAmerica is currently Googling
[03:24] <wad> me too
[03:24] <wad> :)
[03:25] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: Might I ask why you need a specific version? Why not just have the most recent OpenJDK or Java at the ready?
[03:26] <wad> That's a good question. I write stuff in Java, so I need to have control over which version of Java I have on my laptop.
[03:26] <wad> I have four versions installed, with a symbolic link to choose which one I want to use.
[03:26] <SonikkuAmerica> One second...
[03:27] <wad> I'm writing a java web application right now, and it's going to need an applet in it. I haven't bothered to configure chromium to run applets yet.
[03:27] <SonikkuAmerica> Does OpenJDK have all the older versions packed into it or do they need to be installed 1 by 1?
[03:27] <SonikkuAmerica> (Public question)
[03:27]  * wad nods
[03:28] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: OK, so we need Chromium to reference the correct version...
[03:28] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: Does [ ln -s ] work at all?
[03:28] <wad> Yes. Ideally, I would just create a symbolic link from my java to some directory... yes
[03:28] <wad> There is a /opt/google/
[03:29] <wad> I just don't know which directory to link the right .so file into. I've tried four different ones; none work.
[03:29] <wad> I guess I could try diving the source of Chromium... ;)
[03:30] <SonikkuAmerica> I would assume using [ ln -s ] to change the link for /usr/bin/java/ &-or /usr/lib/java/ would work (not sure)
[03:30] <SonikkuAmerica> *or openjdk if you have that
=== sburjan_ is now known as sburjan`
[03:30] <wad> That would work.
[03:31] <wad> How does Chromium know where to find java?
[03:31] <SonikkuAmerica> Give it a shot
[03:31] <wad> This is a mystery.
[03:31] <wad> I'll try it. Maybe it will just find it there in the expected location.
[03:31] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: I'm thinking it defaults to /usr/bin/java or /usr/bin/openjdk but...
[03:32] <SonikkuAmerica> wad: A note of warning, though... Chromium will hate you.
[03:32] <wad> lol
[03:32] <SonikkuAmerica> It will point at you and scream "HAX!"
[03:32] <mega1> i dont want a user too see any other folder than there home folder when using ftp
[03:33] <wad> heh
[03:34] <SonikkuAmerica> mega1: In other words, you don't want to share those folders
[03:34] <SonikkuAmerica> ?
[03:34] <SonikkuAmerica> Other than /home/<whoever>/
[03:34] <mega1> i think so
[03:34] <mega1> yes but only for that user
[03:34] <fungoat> Anybody know of an easy way to wipe a drive, including LVM data, from the Live CD/USB?
[03:35] <MoL0ToV> also i was unable to share a single folder
[03:35] <fungoat> Trying to install over the top of Fedora 17.
[03:35] <MoL0ToV> via nautilus
[03:35] <MoL0ToV> don't work
[03:35] <SonikkuAmerica> fungoat: Smash it with a hammer. lol. Seriously, use gparted
[03:36] <SonikkuAmerica> GParted should take care of it if you select the drive and say "Erase"
[03:36] <MoL0ToV> fungoat: sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=2M
[03:36] <Sling> gparted doesn't really wipe, it will just fiddle with the partition map
[03:36] <MoL0ToV> for about 30 sec, then ctrl+c
[03:36] <ikonia> fungoat: you should have to to nothing, just make sure you tell the installer to format the partition at install time
[03:36] <ikonia> MoL0ToV: there is zero need for that
[03:36] <fungoat> SonikkuAmerica: Tried. No dice.
[03:36] <Sling> use dban if you want to wipe
[03:37] <SonikkuAmerica> Odd, GParted didn't work... Well, every program has its limits
[03:37] <fungoat> ikonia: I wish. I get I/O errors during the install when going that route.
[03:37] <MoL0ToV> i love dd :D
[03:37] <MoL0ToV> and also the led of hard disk always on
[03:37] <ikonia> fungoat: ok, that suggests there is more of a problem
[03:37] <MoL0ToV> for a while
[03:37] <MoL0ToV> what windows is unable to do
[03:37] <SonikkuAmerica> mega1:
[03:37] <mega1> how do i do that
[03:37] <ikonia> MoL0ToV: please try to offer real help, than help based on you liking an LED blinking
[03:37] <MoL0ToV> :)
[03:38] <Sling> MoL0ToV: windows can do that fine, what are you going on about
[03:38] <MoL0ToV> ikonia i use dd to wipe disk, is the surely way
[03:38] <mega1> SonikkuAmerica: yes
[03:38] <MoL0ToV> more safer
[03:38] <Sling> MoL0ToV: depends on what you mean with 'wipe'
[03:38] <ikonia> MoL0ToV: he's not asking to "wipe a disk"
[03:38] <ikonia> MoL0ToV: he's trying to install ubuntu over the partition layout created by fedora
[03:39] <MoL0ToV> <fungoat> Anybody know of an easy way to wipe a drive, including LVM data, from the Live CD/USB?
=== len is now known as Guest69707
[03:39] <MoL0ToV> the question is clear.
[03:39] <ikonia> I missed that part, apologies
[03:39] <SonikkuAmerica> mega1: Run [ sudo gedit /etc/vsftpd.conf ] in a terminal and add this: [ chroot_list_enable=YES ] and [ chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list ]
[03:39] <ikonia> you need to use gksudo - not sudo for gedit
[03:40] <Transhumanist> MoL0ToV: why did you choose bs=2M, out of curiousity?
[03:40] <SonikkuAmerica> ikonia: I had no problems from a GUI, but you're right if it's not a GUI
[03:40] <ikonia> SonikkuAmerica: if it's a gui app - you need to use gksudo - not sudo
[03:40] <SonikkuAmerica> So yes mega1: [ gksudo ] not just [ sudo ]
[03:40] <MoL0ToV> Transfusion, to use caching, if you don't specify reads 512byte blocks that is very slow than read 2M at time
[03:41] <subcool> Just realizing- so how the hell do i fix the flash for Chrome?
[03:41] <SonikkuAmerica> mega1: Then [ gksudo gedit /etc/vsftpd.chroot_list ] and restrict the users you wish.
[03:41] <Transhumanist> righto :)
[03:41] <litropy> Hi, all. I've got a standard apache2 installation on Ubuntu. I accedentally chowned the www dir, and I need to chown it back to what it was. What was it originally?
[03:41] <fungoat> MoL0ToV: How long should the dd procedure take?
[03:42] <MoL0ToV> you notice this when datapiping to netcat to do remote raw images
[03:42] <Transhumanist> depends on drive size, fungoat
[03:42] <fungoat> 256GB SSD
[03:42] <Transhumanist> maybe a few minutes if it's a few hundred gig
[03:42] <subcool> Tex_Nick, thanks for the info - but it didnt work out. ffmpeg is depreciated, avconv is- a pain- atleast to install, I tried openshot- doesnt support it.. and now im using avidemux, but i keeps messing up the sound.
[03:42] <Transhumanist> it won't give you any status updates until dd completes
[03:42] <fungoat> Transhumanist: Is there a verbose option?
[03:42] <SonikkuAmerica> mega1: Or to limit all users, just uncomment [ chroot_local_user=YES ] in the /etc/vsftpd.conf file.
[03:43] <MoL0ToV> fungoat, yes, but if you want merely delete partitions lvm and have a ready disk for a new install, you can simply run dd for 30 secs, then CTRL+C
[03:43] <Transhumanist> http://linux.die.net/man/1/dd
[03:43] <MoL0ToV> wothout blanking ENTIRELY the disk with zeroes
[03:44] <fungoat> Thank you Transhumanist and MoL0ToV. Wish me luck…
[03:44] <MoL0ToV> is waste of time if the data on the disk is not sensible data
[03:44] <psusi> fungoat, if you get IO errors then your drive is probably broke... check the SMART status in the disk utility
[03:44] <Tex_Nick> subcool : if you want we could go to private chat ... i would be glad to help you with ffmpeg ... it will do more than you can imangine ;)
[03:45] <litropy> Is anyone here running apache2?
[03:45] <subcool> i tried to laod it, and it said to use avconv. im going to bed now anyways- thanks. it wsa just to edit something funny for my friend. But now facebook wont even let me upload it, so f. it
[03:45] <psusi> fungoat, you also don't want to go writing all over an SSD.. writes wear them out
[03:45] <Transhumanist> fungoat: why are you doing it this way?
[03:45] <fungoat> psusi: I'm hoping not.
[03:45] <Transhumanist> do you just want to erase the partition to make news ones or install a new OS?
[03:46] <Transhumanist> if so, use GParted erase instead.
[03:46] <litropy> ActionParsnip, You'll probably know: by default, what owner is assigned to www in apache2? I chowned it accidentally.
[03:46] <jjgalvez__> ezrafree: Thanks for the advice on changing my wifi channel, that did the trick, now my speed it back to normal. Really odd most of the channels give me horrible but I found one that works great!
[03:46] <Tex_Nick> subcool : ok
[03:46] <MoL0ToV> good night people!
[03:46] <fungoat> Transfusion: Yes. Exekept the LVMs from Fedora won't go away. Even with GParted.
[03:46] <Transhumanist> righto
[03:46] <ActionParsnip> Litropy:   root:www    maybe......
[03:46] <Transhumanist> odd
[03:46] <psusi> fungoat, what do you mean they won't go away?
[03:47] <Jordan_U> fungoat: wipefs might remove the stale LVM signatures, though they shouldn't generally cause problems. What problem are you actually having?
[03:47] <MoL0ToV> a question: in gnome2, gnome panel, etc... howto enable normal windows scroller? the one present, that appears only rollover, is frustrating me...
[03:47] <fungoat> psusi: They cannot be wiped in GParted or Fedora's Disks utility.
[03:48] <psusi> fungoat, gparted can delete them just fine
[03:48] <ActionParsnip> Jjgalvez__: there are lines you can add to /etc/sysctl.conf   to make it a little faster by using more RAM as cache
[03:48] <somsip> litropy: www-data is the usual owner of the apache2 process, and /var/www is chown root:www-data
[03:48] <fungoat> psusi: Unfortunately, not the case here.
[03:49] <psusi> fungoat, you'll have to be more specific
[03:49] <jjgalvez__> ActionParsnip: do you know of a good tutorial, the ones I've read are really confusing
[03:49] <MoL0ToV> dd destroy everything, try it more simple and linear
[03:49] <psusi> dd also wears out the ssd
[03:49] <Sling> you dont want the webcontent to be owned by www-data or by root
[03:49] <n0hx> i just discovered tails
[03:49] <n0hx> so cool
[03:49] <Sling> use a separate user for that
[03:50] <MoL0ToV> don't wear the ssd for a single pass.. of only 30 seconds :)
[03:50] <ActionParsnip> Jjgalvez__: http://db.tt/8g8vppc7    add those lines to the file. Works well on my 2Gb RAM system
[03:51] <ActionParsnip> N0hx: as in the Sega character?
[03:52] <jjgalvez__> ActionParsnip: Thanks I'll give those a try
[03:52] <MoL0ToV> Timing buffered disk reads: 350 MB in  3.02 seconds = 115.87 MB/sec my ssd is so slow... the specs say 500Mbyte/s..
[03:52] <Transhumanist> SSD lifetime is huge these days anyway
=== dniMretsaM is now known as dniMretsaM_away
[03:53] <MoL0ToV> i can try to enable ahci instead ide in bios? is more faster?
[03:53] <psusi> ahci is better, whether it is faster or not you'll have to see
[03:54] <MoL0ToV> a question: in gnome2, gnome panel, etc... howto enable normal windows scroller? the one present, that appears only rollover, is frustrating me...
[03:54] <ActionParsnip> MolL0tov: use hdparm to check dma is enabled and so forth
[03:55] <ActionParsnip> Mol0tov: didn't know lucid had overlay scrollbars...
[03:55] <goddard> how should i format my hard drive with a fresh install it is 1TB
[03:56] <ActionParsnip> Goddard: for only Ubuntu?
[03:56] <psusi> goddard, you'll have to be more specific
[03:56] <MoL0ToV> DMA: mdma0 mdma1 mdma2 udma0 udma1 udma2 udma3 udma4 udma5 *udma6
[03:56] <MoL0ToV> udma6 is possible that is a brake for my ssd disk?
[03:57] <MoL0ToV> ActionParsnip, i use quantal
[03:57] <ActionParsnip> Goddard: for me, 20gb / ext4. 1.1xRAM for swap ( I assume 2gb RAM or greater) and the rest s ext4 for /home
[03:58] <ActionParsnip> Mol0Tov: gnome2 isn't in any of Quantal
[03:59] <MoL0ToV> who are called... gnome2 mode... backward? i don't remember
[03:59] <MoL0ToV> when you select gnome2 classic in gdm
[04:00] <litropy> somsip, I'm not familiar with the syntax. root is the owner and www-dta is the group?
[04:00] <litropy> www-data*
=== Optichip` is now known as Optichip
[04:00] <ActionParsnip> Mol0tov: Quantal uses gnome 3. You can install gnome-panel and get something like the old style session

[04:00] <Graymayre> can someone assist me with installing ubuntu 32 thru windows, it wants to automatically install 64
[04:01] <MoL0ToV> there i have a disgusting rollover windows scrolling bars
[04:01] <Tex_Nick> ActionParsnip : that's interesting ... do you segregate /home for backuo or ???
[04:01] <somsip> litropy: that's right
[04:01] <MoL0ToV> ActionParsnip,  i set the crux theme, but the bars classic of crux don't appears
[04:01] <ActionParsnip> Tex_nick: yes, backup as well as easy reinstall

[04:02] <MoL0ToV> thanks
[04:02] <Fonsie> i have a question about duel boot installation, can anybody please help
[04:02] <Graymayre> what about it
[04:02] <ActionParsnip> Mol0Tov: amazing what a quick websearch brings up huh....
[04:03] <Tex_Nick> ActionParsnip : hey thanks for that ... i've done it the hard way for years :(
[04:03] <MoL0ToV> surely a menu config item to disable... to associate at this command is needed.. my grandfather scream if i say to him to open terminal and place this command :D
[04:03] <Graymayre> dual boot isnt manual anymore, it sets up automatically now
[04:04] <Fonsie> i tried installing by downloading to portable hard drive and set it to boot from it and nothing happened
[04:04] <ActionParsnip> Tex_nick: I also shove my web cache in tempfs for speed :-). Its good for SSDs too, fewer writes with worthless data
[04:04] <Fonsie> it just signed me into my windows
[04:04] <Graymayre> what are you running from internal?
[04:05] <Fonsie> i have it booting from usb portable hard drive
[04:05] <ActionParsnip> Molo0tov: maybe, but its sometimes easier to give a command users can copy snd paste too. Both ways have merit
[04:05] <Graymayre> but is your MBR on your external drive?
[04:05] <Fonsie> mbr?
[04:05] <Graymayre> when you installed it, were you running another OS on a hard drive located internally?
[04:06] <Fonsie> my main OS is windows 7 and it is on internal hdd
[04:06] <Graymayre> thats why
[04:06] <ActionParsnip> Mol0Tov: you can run dconf-settings and do it manually if you want, or you can just run the command
[04:06] <Fonsie> seperate from external drive
[04:06] <MoL0ToV> ActionParsnip, i tryed to logout and login but overlay scrollbars still here
[04:06] <Graymayre> MBR (master boot record)
[04:06] <Tex_Nick> ActionParsnip : ok ... i luv that ... gotta reconfigure this box now ... thanks for the tip
[04:06] <Graymayre> it is loaded in the 100 meg partition on the front of your windows 7 drive
[04:07] <litropy> somsip, thx I'm all set.
[04:07] <Fonsie> the website said i can install from portable hdd or disk
[04:07] <Graymayre> yes, as long as it is configured to have its own boot record
[04:07] <Graymayre> in that case, have you configured your bios to boot from it yet>?
[04:07] <Fonsie> and i set it to boot from portable usb hdd and it just signs into windows anyways
[04:08] <Graymayre> have you disconnected your internal drive?
[04:08] <Fonsie> i put my usb hdd #1 on boot list
[04:08] <Fonsie> and no i have not
[04:08] <Graymayre> keep in mind, default setting is to boot in an order, your internal drive by default comes first
[04:08] <ActionParsnip> Tex_nick: I use a symlink from ~/.config/google-chrome to /run/google-chrome   I have commands in /etc/rc.local to recreate the folder and chown it each boot
[04:08] <Graymayre> alright, disconnect it and try again
[04:08] <Fonsie> yeah, i set it to boot from portable and did nothing
[04:09] <somsip> litropy: cool. But that was just answering your question. As others have said, there may be security issues around using default permissions, but that's a different matter

=== cwind is now known as Guest2260
[04:09] <ActionParsnip> Mol0tov: if you like the old style session,  why not just use XFCE, you can run all your Gnome applications there without issue
[04:09] <Noskcaj> juggalonaut1, type /j #ubuntu-quality
[04:10] <Graymayre> it is possible that it cant because the bios wont initialize those ports until an OS loads
[04:10] <kujablak> arch, I'd like to know how to make an inventory of all the softwares I installed so I can upgrade
[04:10] <MoL0ToV> ActionParsnip, i try it
[04:10] <Graymayre> but of course, being a netbook it should be able to because it has no internal cd rom drive to do installs from
[04:10] <Fonsie> so what do i need to do?
[04:10] <MoL0ToV> are available also compix in xfce? and effects?
=== Guest2260 is now known as cmind
[04:11] <Graymayre> google booting from USB on your particular model of netbook
[04:11] <ActionParsnip> Mol0Tov: you only need the xfce4 package,  then log off and log in to the xfce session
[04:11] <Fonsie> i think i downloaded the wrong file to hdd, i just tried opening it and it says its a file to be burned to a disk and asks me to select a burner

=== Albastos|off is now known as Albastos
[04:11] <Graymayre> probably so
[04:12] <Graymayre> you will have to do an actual install to it
[04:12] <Graymayre> you cant just copy files
[04:12] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  whats the filea name?
[04:12] <Fonsie> can you link a clean download?
[04:12] <Tex_Nick> ActionParsnip : you see a significant performance with that ??? ... BTW haven't seen you in a while ... hope you had a great holiday :-)
[04:12] <Fonsie> ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64
[04:12] <Graymayre> just go to the ubuntu download site
[04:13] <Graymayre> it will give you an ISO image
[04:13] <Graymayre> you will have to burn it to disk
[04:13] <Graymayre> and then install from that disk
[04:13] <Graymayre> OR
[04:13] <Fonsie> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/thank-you?release=latest&bits=64&distro=desktop&status=zeroc
[04:13] <Fonsie> that is the url for the page i downloaded from
[04:13] <Graymayre> hold on, brb
[04:14] <ActionParsnip> Tex_nick: thanks. You too :-), its slightly faster. No point going through RAM and to the storage,  waste of time. Eeb cache isnt really needed nowadays.
[04:14] <ActionParsnip> Geaymayre: you forgit MD5 testing
[04:14] <Graymayre> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/try-ubuntu-before-you-install
[04:14] <Graymayre> do boot from USB stick
[04:14] <Fonsie> i did
[04:14] <Graymayre> install it like the external drive is a USB stick
[04:14] <Fonsie> and it goes straight to windows
[04:15] <Fonsie> it lists the brand and everything of my hdd
[04:15] <Fonsie> it is #1 on my boot list
[04:15] <Graymayre> what kind of external drive interface are you using?
[04:15] <Graymayre> brand i mean
[04:15] <dr_willis> if you dont see a grub menu, then its either booting the wrong hd. or you put grub on the wrong mbr
[04:15] <Fonsie> Western Digital
[04:16] <Graymayre> it may require driver support, which is not recognized by the bios
[04:16] <Graymayre> it will still recognize it and list it
[04:16] <Graymayre> but not more than that
[04:17] <Fonsie> can you confirm that is the correct file to have on the hdd when i boot from it
[04:17] <MoL0ToV> lightdm support multiple session like gdm? (kde,fce,gnome-classic, gnome3) or no?
[04:17] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  how did you install to the usb?
[04:17] <dr_willis> MoL0ToV:  it does
[04:17] <Fonsie> i didnt just copied the file i downloaded from the site to it
[04:18] <MoL0ToV> preload deamon is suggested to speedup system? why is not installed by default on ubuntu?
[04:18] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  err.. you did it wrong then.. whats on the usb now? just a big ubuntu.iso ?
[04:18] <Fonsie> ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64
[04:18] <Fonsie> that is the file that i copied to it
[04:18] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  you did it wrong then
[04:18] <Graymayre> you have to use the linux universal usb installer
[04:18] <dr_willis> you use a tool to properly make a bootable usb drive
[04:19] <Graymayre> and load the iso in it and let it do its work
[04:19] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: how did you "copy" it?
[04:19] <Fonsie> dragged it
[04:19] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  you did it wrong then...
[04:19] <Graymayre> lol
[04:19] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: grab a copy of unetbootin
[04:19] <dr_willis> ;)
[04:19] <MoL0ToV> openoffice start in 1 sec with preload daemon! sound great! :)
[04:19] <Graymayre> alright, you got him, can someone assist me with something?
[04:20] <Fonsie> so what exactly am i downloading and doing?
[04:20] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: simply copying and pasting is not going to work, you need software to set it up right
[04:20] <Graymayre> I need to load 32 bit ubuntu instead of 64, the windows isntaller automatically installs 64
[04:20] <dr_willis> you put the iso on your hard drive. delete it from the usb. use a TOOL from pendrivelinux website to make a bootable usb disk from the iso
[04:21] <Graymayre> http://www.pendrivelinux.com/universal-usb-installer-easy-as-1-2-3/#button
[04:21] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  a tool such as unetbootin, or others
[04:21] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: unetbootin,  use that. Point it to the ISO you downloadd, ensure the correct drive letter is set to transfr to as well as persistence if it is needed
[04:22] <Fonsie> ok, thank you
[04:23] <Graymayre> ok, ill try a different route than the windows installer, I need to make my USB stick bootable, but for the 32 bit installer instead.  I need to burn the iso directly to it and make it bootable
[04:23] <dr_willis> you can image the iso to the usb and it should be bootable
[04:24] <Graymayre> with what tool
[04:24] <PoorCollegeGuy> Graymayre, use unetbootin
[04:24] <MoL0ToV> xfce is beautiful. i migrate all 200 pc in my domain! :)
[04:24] <PoorCollegeGuy> "burns" the iso to a usb stick to install
[04:24] <Graymayre> i dont want to install ubuntu on it, just the installer
[04:24] <dr_willis> dd, or ohther win imageing tools , of you dont want to go the unetbootin type route
[04:24] <Transhumanist> Graymayre: no, the windows installer does NOT automatically instal 64 bit Ubuntu
[04:24] <dr_willis> the windows installer = wubi
[04:24] <Transhumanist> I've used that Windows installer dozens of times to setup a 32bit live USB
[04:24] <Graymayre> it did for me
[04:25] <Graymayre> it didnt offer me the option
[04:25] <Transhumanist> Are you asking Universal USB installer to download the ISO for you, or are you supplying it yourself?
[04:25] <Graymayre> i have the 32 bit 12.10 iso
[04:25] <Fonsie> ok, another question....my windows is 64bit, should i put 64 or 32bit ubuntu on it?
[04:25] <Graymayre> need to install it on my secondary drive
[04:25] <dr_willis> Fonsie:  i use 64bit os on 64bit hardware
[04:25] <Transhumanist> and when you open universal  USb installer, what's the first option you get to choose?
[04:26] <Transhumanist> the drop down box of different distros?
[04:26] <PoorCollegeGuy> Graymayre, unetbootin turns it into a bootable usb drive, but once you boot into it, there is an option to install linux on the computer itself
[04:26] <PoorCollegeGuy> i just did it to my laptop an hour ago
[04:26] <Graymayre> i have to go with 32 bit because of my wireless stick
[04:26] <rd4> can I use script modify the network-manager static ip address infomation?
[04:26] <Graymayre> >Fonsie
[04:26] <Transhumanist> yeah that's fine. 32-bit is fine.
=== elky` is now known as elky
[04:26] <Graymayre> i owuld use 64 if i could, and i have been but without wireless support
[04:27] <Graymayre> linksys AE2500 if anyone is familiar with my issue
[04:27] <Graymayre> but ok, unetbootin it is
[04:28] <fungoat> Anyone else have issues with 12.10 not recognizing an Intel HD3000 chip (Lenovo X201)?
[04:28] <fward> I was wondering if someone might help me with something. I connected a ubuntu desktop to a windows domain. Afterward the terminal window does not show PS1 and terminal window shortcuts are not functioning. I am using bash for the shell
[04:28] <ActionParsnip> Graymayre: if its a usb wifi stick then just buy one kniwn to work, they are cheap
[04:28] <Transhumanist> fward: once off or recurrs upon restart?
[04:29] <ikonia> fward: does the prompt show "noname"
[04:29] <rd4> ok.I find the ansert at  /NetworkManager/system-connection
[04:29] <dr_willis> fward:  try 'echo $SHELL'  to be sure. try sourceing your .profile and .bashrc files
[04:29] <ActionParsnip> Fward: what if you run:  source ~/.bashrc      is anything output?
[04:30] <Fonsie> does my portable have to be formatted in order to install iso to it?
[04:30] <fward> it shows $ only at shell. I echoed $SHELL and it is reporting /bin/bash it happens while logged in. After I login to local account all goes back to normal
[04:30] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie: yes
[04:30] <fward> So I am guessing it is a local config file, but I am unsure where the settings for the terminal shortcuts are kept
[04:31] <Fonsie> and how much space do i need?
[04:31] <ikonia> fward: I suspect your domain is setting the home directory wrong so there is no bashrc/bash_profile/profile to source
[04:32] <ActionParsnip> Fonsie 800mb. You can use the remaining space for persistence
[04:32] <fward> hm, yeah forgot about that. so set that manually and all should be good to go. I will try it, ikonia.
[04:32] <Graymayre> just out of cursiosity, the windows installer, what does it mean by "install size"?
[04:33] <Transhumanist> <Graymayre> just out of cursiosity, the windows installer, what does it mean by "install size"?
[04:34] <Transhumanist> Huuuh? Could you show me where you downloaded it?
[04:34] <Transhumanist> Oh, you mean Wubi?
[04:34] <Transhumanist> So you want to install Ubuntu on top of your Windows partition instead of to its own partition?
[04:34] <Graymayre> http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/windows-installer
[04:34] <Graymayre> yes
[04:34] <Graymayre> NO
[04:34] <Graymayre> lol
[04:34] <Transhumanist> That's Wubi
[04:35] <Transhumanist> do you want to install Ubuntu on its own partition or not?
[04:35] <Graymayre> i already installed it on a separate drive
[04:35] <Graymayre> its done
[04:35] <Graymayre> my question was about the "install size" selection
[04:35] <Transhumanist> Wubi isn't what you want. That Windows installer isn't what you want. It's something rather different and less stable.
[04:35] <PoorCollegeGuy> doesn't it cap the ubuntu download at 40GB too?
[04:35] <PoorCollegeGuy> 40GB = useless
[04:35] <Graymayre> 30
[04:36] <Graymayre> but anyway
[04:36] <Transhumanist> My Ubuntu install is usually 15gb or so. 40 gb is plenty if you have another HD
[04:36] <Graymayre> what are the different install sizes for?
[04:36] <Graymayre> what does it add or cut out?
[04:36] <Transhumanist> Stop using that, Graymayre
[04:36] <Transhumanist> it's not for you
[04:36] <Graymayre> im not
[04:36] <Transhumanist> oh ok
[04:36] <Transhumanist> well it's just capped at 30gb for the Wubi install
[04:36] <Graymayre> im using a USB stick now installine 32 bit instead because of issues with a wireless adapter
[04:36] <Transhumanist> presumably due to performance or stability reasons
[04:37] <usr13> Graymayre: So how much free space do you have?
[04:37] <Graymayre> just compatibility with a specific piece of hardware
[04:37] <Graymayre> 3 TB :P
[04:37] <Transhumanist> Wubi installs Ubuntu on an ext filesystem on TOP of an NTFS file system, whilst keeping whatever was already on the NTFS file system intact
[04:37] <usr13> Graymayre: What you want is suggestion for partition(s) size for your install?  Right?
[04:37] <Graymayre> i absolutely wouldnt do that
[04:38] <Graymayre> i am using a separate 250 GB hdd
[04:38] <usr13> Graymayre: 8G for swap,  30G for /  and the rest for /home
[04:38] <Transhumanist> depends on your RAM size
[04:38] <Graymayre> i have 4 drives, 2 win7 (32/64) win2k or xp soon, and ubuntu for the last
[04:38] <Transhumanist> you may not need such a large swap
[04:39] <Graymayre> well i will leave on default options
[04:39] <usr13> Graymayre: How much RAM do you have?
[04:39] <Graymayre> 4
[04:39] <Graymayre> dell xps 720, old but decked
[04:39] <Transhumanist> 8GB sounds good then yeah :)
[04:39] <usr13> Graymayre: 4 or 5G for swap is ok.
[04:39] <Transhumanist> I'd choose 8GB so I could hibernate
[04:39] <usr13> Graymayre: 8 even better... Yes
[04:39] <Graymayre> i am a linux noob, what is swap, is that like ram?  or pagefile in windows?
[04:40] <Transhumanist> yeah, like pagefile on Windows
[04:40] <iBurley> like a pagefile
[04:40] <Graymayre> gotcha, hard ram
[04:40] <Ailos> why is the driver version in the software centre older than the driver on the manufacturer site?
[04:40] <Graymayre> alright i am learning something :)
[04:40] <usr13> Graymayre: "virtual memory" in "MS-Windows" speak is what it amounts to,.
[04:40] <Graymayre> right
[04:40] <Graymayre> old win2k server admin here
[04:40] <Transhumanist> Ailos: software centre versions are stable and vetted. But they may not be the latest version for that reason
[04:40] <usr13> !swap | Graymayre
[04:40] <ubottu> Graymayre: swap is used to move unused programs and data out of main memory to make your system faster. It can also be used as extra memory if you don't have enough. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq for more info
[04:40] <Graymayre> complete n00b here
[04:41] <Ailos> they are more stable than Nvidias current version?
[04:41] <Graymayre> gotcha
[04:41] <iBurley> So I have a problem in Ubuntu, specifically in TeamSpeak, I can't set my side buttons as push to talk, or anything else, but they still take me forward and backwards in my browser. Any way to fix that?
[04:41] <Transhumanist> maybe. or the guy maintaining it is just lazy
[04:41] <usr13> Graymayre: That's ok.  You've come to the right place.  Plenty of info here.
[04:41] <Graymayre> alright, anyone familiar with the linksys AE2500 wireless USB stick compatibility issues?
[04:41] <Ailos> alright, ill try the centres version
[04:42] <Transhumanist> Ailos: yeah when it comes to drivers, it's usually not laziness but performance and stability that the reason the version might be older in the repo
[04:42] <Graymayre> nice big 13 page thread on it and I am a monkey in a nuclear lab
[04:42] <Transhumanist> Graymayre: so what've you done so far? Have you used Universal USB Creator or Unetbootin to create a USB boot drive for Ubuntu 12.10 32-bit?
[04:43] <Ailos> ok, thank you
[04:43] <Graymayre> unet
[04:43] <Transhumanist> And did it install properly?
[04:43] <Graymayre> this will be easy from here
[04:43] <Graymayre> yes, to the usb
[04:43] <Graymayre> i am currently using the computer tho
[04:43] <Transhumanist> Does it boot?
[04:43] <Transhumanist> ah ok
[04:43] <Graymayre> i need to get irc on my phone
[04:43] <Transhumanist> haha
[04:43] <Graymayre> recommendations?
[04:44] <nalidixic> Hi All. I have an Ubuntu install I'm using to play around with some hobby projects. My understanding with mysql is that I should be using mysqld_safe to run the server however when I reboot my Ubuntu install mysqld starts. How can I change that?
[04:44] <arch> nalidixic
[04:44] <Transhumanist> When you were in 64-bit Ubuntu with the broken wireless radio, did you check for a proprietary driver to use?
[04:44] <Transhumanist> Maybe that would've fixed it.
[04:44] <Graymayre> check this out regarding that http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1805830
[04:44] <Graymayre> no proprietary driver
[04:45] <arch> wow
[04:45] <arch> n00buntu
[04:45] <Graymayre> none to date
[04:45] <Graymayre> yepper
[04:45] <Graymayre> u nailed it arch
[04:45] <Ailos> so uh, the Installing Packages window is just solid gray instead of installing my driver, thats probably not a good thing?
[04:45] <Transhumanist> That's an 11 page thread, man. What specifically did you want me to look at?
[04:46] <Graymayre> sorry mate, i have looked at it for a while and got very little out of it
[04:46] <Graymayre> check out page 4
[04:46] <Transhumanist> Ailos: wait a few minutes, if nothing happens, restart and try again. That's what I'd do. Or find the package name and use apt-get instead (I prefer this)
[04:46] <Graymayre> nvm, let me find it and lik
[04:46] <Graymayre> link
[04:46] <Ailos> alright, ill be patient
[04:47] <Transhumanist> Garymayre: a lot of hardware is very closed-source and proprietary and the manufacturers don't like Linux. So sometimes it's just a case of buying from better companies. Doesn't always help when you have existing hardware that you want to use though.
[04:47] <Graymayre> exactly
[04:48] <Graymayre> and little to no extra money to get something compatible
[04:48] <Tex_Nick> nalidixic : if you don't get an answer here ... you might try #mysql & #httpd
[04:48] <usr13> Graymayre: You know that thread is a couple years old.  Right?
[04:49] <Graymayre> im just going to try from step one on 32 bit and see if ndiswrapper will solve the issue on it
[04:49] <Graymayre> yes
[04:49] <Graymayre> a year
[04:49] <Graymayre> BUT
[04:49] <usr13> Graymayre: Is a wireless card your issue?
[04:49] <Graymayre> if you go to the most recent posts it is just starting form the beginning again and rehashing
[04:49] <Graymayre> it is, USB wireless stick
[04:49] <iBurley> Does Ubuntu have problems recognizing side mouse buttons?
[04:49] <Transhumanist> So Graymayre, when you install 32-bit Ubuntu, be sure to check the proprietary drivers list in the software sources section of the system preferences
[04:50] <Transhumanist> you might have a driver listed for your wireless radio after all
[04:50] <Graymayre> alright
[04:50] <usr13> Graymayre: Is it in now?
[04:50] <Graymayre> (thats what she said)
[04:50] <Graymayre> but no, still on the computer im talking to you on
[04:50] <Graymayre> oh, the stick, yes
[04:50] <Graymayre> but im on windows 7
[04:50] <usr13> Graymayre: And you are booted to MS Windows?
[04:51] <Graymayre> yep
[04:51] <usr13> Graymayre: Just do the install and see what happens.
[04:51] <Graymayre> i didnt know how to check proprietary drivers before
[04:51] <Graymayre> should i try it with the 64 bit version first?
[04:51] <Graymayre> see if it actually is there?
[04:52] <usr13> Graymayre: I would use 32bit
[04:52] <Transhumanist> just go with 64-bit
[04:52] <Transhumanist> you've only got 4gb of RAM anyway
[04:52] <usr13> Graymayre: There is not much in the way of specific advice we can give because we don't know much about the hardware yet.
[04:53] <Transhumanist> *32-bit
[04:53] <Transhumanist> I mean go with 32-bit
[04:53] <Graymayre> alright
[04:53] <Graymayre> anyone play eve?
[04:53] <Transhumanist> Does it run on Linux?
[04:54] <Graymayre> lol lemme check

[04:54] <Ailos> so Installing Packages window vanished with no other prompts. did the driver install?
[04:55] <Graymayre> so i guess not
[04:55] <nalidixic> Tex_Nick: thanks
[04:55] <Transhumanist> Ailos: go back to the package in software centre and see if it says "installed" or not
[04:56] <Ailos> ah yes

[05:03] <machicola> nyone know of an app the adds a touchpad enable/disable hotkey?
=== daniel is now known as Guest3528
=== Guest3528 is now known as jambeedrum
[05:04] <machicola> i used to used to used touchpad-indicator which doesn't seem to be available anymore
[05:04] <machicola> there were two on ubuntu software center listing, first one doesn't have settings for a hotkey enable/disable &
[05:05] <machicola> second one is 325megs
[05:05] <machicola> which seems like a lot for that
[05:05] <dr_willis> or its for kde...
[05:05] <dr_willis> ;)
[05:06] <dr_willis> if you knew the cli commands to enable/disable you could make your own

[05:10] <machicola> wow, awesome link... thanks Tex_Nick
[05:11] <machicola> did not know about xinput list
[05:11] <Ailos> after installing my nvidia driver, window borders and text is almost twice as big, but resolution is correct. How do i change it?
[05:13] <Tex_Nick> machicola : you're welcome ... hope it helps ... if not, there was a more specific link i found a while back
[05:14] <Ailos> although, maybe its for the best
[05:14] <Ailos> is there a way to check if my video driver is properly installed?
[05:15] <MeanEYE> Ailos: Starting nvidia-settings will tell you if nvidia driver is being used.
[05:15] <Gyro54> What is wrong with this as an entry in fstab - //192.168.1.2/kkcdata /mnt/p_drive cifs Kevin,password=new,iocharset=utf8,mode=0777,dir_mode=0777 0 0
[05:16] <MeanEYE> Ailos: Also, lsmod | grep nvidia should show if driver is loaded by kernel.
[05:16] <Ailos> nvidia x server settings?
[05:16] <MeanEYE> Ailos: that's the command name: nvidia-settings. Basically it's nVidia's control panel.
[05:16] <Ailos> and running that command outputs:
[05:16] <Ailos> nvidia              10236405  42
[05:17] <MeanEYE> Gyro54: What's the problem?
[05:17] <Ailos> alright
[05:17] <MeanEYE> Gyro54: you are probably missing user=Kevin instead of just Kevin.
[05:17] <Gyro54> MeanEYE:  This works manually  - sudo mount -t cifs //192.168.1.2/kkcdata /mnt/p_drive -o username=Kevin,password=new
[05:18] <Gyro54> MeanEYE: Is that all it is?
[05:18] <MeanEYE> Gyro54: Am not sure. Check /var/log/error.log. You should be able to get more info from there.
[05:19] <MeanEYE> Sorry /var/log/syslog
[05:19] <Gyro54> MeanEYE: Thanks for your help.  That will be problem.
[05:20] <DJJeff> gpio_ich: failed to claim resource 0 http://pastie.org/5618577 should I be worried about this?

[05:28] <Fonsie> can anybody help me, im trying to install ubuntu to portable usb hdd to boot from to install to windows but wont let me
[05:29] <MeanEYE> Gyro54: no need. Am just explaining how fstab works.
[05:29] <Fonsie> im trying to use unetbootin and keeps saying there isnt a flash drive there
[05:29] <Fonsie> when there is
[05:29] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: unetbootin requires super user. Did you run it with sudo?
[05:29] <Fonsie> huh?
[05:30] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: Oh, sorry. From which OS are you running unetbootin?
[05:30] <Gyro54> MeanEYE: OK
[05:30] <Fonsie> windows 7
[05:31] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: You need to reformat your USB stick to FAT32. Currently it's probably NTFS.
[05:32] <Fonsie> already did that
[05:34] <MeanEYE> Hm, that's strange.
[05:35] <MeanEYE> So you are sure USB is FAT32?
[05:36] <Fonsie> it was ntfs and it told me to make sure it was formatted to fat32 so i did and it still isnt showing up
[05:37] <MeanEYE> You did remove and connect drive again right. Sorry for asking stupid questions, it just seems strange.
[05:37] <Fonsie> i actually had to reformat it on a different pc because the driver to reformat it to fat32 only runs on xp
[05:37] <Fonsie> so yes
[05:38] <MeanEYE> Hm, that's even stranger. Win7 has FAT32 support as most memory cards use that file system.
[05:39] <MeanEYE> Am stumped here. Perhaps someone else has some ideas.

[05:45] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: Glad to hear that.
[05:45] <aged> got old laptop here and it has cd only and wanted to try it out before igave mr gates some money for windows eight  rrather spend it on a laptop without microsoft rubbish
[05:45] <Amanda2013> but on to da shit what is get-apt for adobe flash
[05:45] <dr_willis> windows 8 on an old laptop? thats sort of scary
[05:46] <aged> do they do a lite version of 12/10
[05:46] <MeanEYE> aged: What seems to be the problem?
[05:46] <Amanda2013> i just ditched win 7 45 mins ago
[05:46] <Amanda2013> lol
[05:46] <Amanda2013> for 12.04
[05:47] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: Google Chrome comes with flash, so you don't need to install it separately. If you are Firefox fan, then you need to install flashplugin-downloader.
[05:47] <aged> meaneye 12 10 doesnt fit on a cd
[05:48] <dr_willis> aged:  lubuntu 12.10 might. then you install ubuntu-desktop package
[05:48] <MeanEYE> aged: It will fit on DVD, or USB drive.
[05:48] <aged> yep but dont have any of them
[05:50] <Amanda2013> i'm smoking on da gas like citgo
[05:50] <aged> just wondered if there was a lite version of it
[05:50] <dr_willis> aged:  none ive seen
[05:51] <aged> so it look like the choice is windows xp then
[05:51] <tonyr2k8> aged, does your laptop currently have windows on it?
[05:51] <dr_willis> aged:  or...... 3rd time...    lubuntu 12.10 might. then you install ubuntu-desktop package
[05:52] <dr_willis> or just use 12.04   because an old laptop might not support pae either.
[05:52] <Aldryk> I'm downloading the boot-repair disk now..any idea if it'll work on a system where the grub configuration doesn't exist at all?
[05:52] <aged> no itwas given to me to get me started to learn about pcs at freinds at moment he said try this irc thingy and ask
[05:52] <MeanEYE> aged: Ubuntu 12.04 is CD sized. You can upgrade to 12.10 after you install it.
[05:53] <Aldryk> That is, the grub (stage 2?) cofiguration was for the old machine with its old HDD, now the ubuntu partition is installed to an altogether different partition on a different disk.
[05:53] <dr_willis> aged:  whatas your cpu on the thing, how old is it?
[05:54] <Fonsie> what should i set my persistent file size to?
[05:54] <MeanEYE> Fonsie: You don't need it if you don't plan on running Ubuntu from USB

[05:56] <Amanda2013> no idea about repos such a n00b
[05:56] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: that means, open software center and search. :D Simple as that. It's available through few clicks.

[06:01] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: You are using Eclipse?

[06:02] <Amanda2013> idk might have to
[06:02] <dr_willis> foxy999:  you could use the command line.
[06:02] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: Did you develop for Android so far?
[06:02] <Amanda2013> no
[06:02] <foxy999> dr_willis. what program?
[06:02] <Amanda2013> just trying to build android x86
[06:02] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: then my advice is to use Eclipse. It helps a lot.
[06:03] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: Is there are reason why you would build the whole android?
[06:03] <Amanda2013> to add ethernet support into 4.0.4
[06:03] <dr_willis> foxy999:  zip can do it.  or just encrypt the arcchive afterwards with pgp or somthing
[06:05] <Amanda2013> $ sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner" $ sudo apt-get update $ sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk

[06:06] <Amanda2013> ah
[06:06] <MeanEYE> Amanda2013: You can build with OpenJDK, my advice check with Google... for example http://blog.markloiseau.com/2012/07/how-to-compile-android-on-ubuntu-12-04/

[07:40] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : ask your question
[07:42] <Nevin> I'm trying to install Ubuntu 12.10. My system uses a UEFI bios, so I run the UEFI version from the USB stick. When I choose to install from the GNU GRUB interface, the screen changes to a blank black screen with a blinking cursor that eventually freezes up.
[07:43] <elfer> geh
[07:44] <laze1989> Etyneo: Depends. If you are using the OSS radeon drivers - only if you are having a muxed system. This means, you will have an option in your BIOS to change the active graphics card. If you have a muxless system, the OSS radeon drivers are not capable of switching, yet. If prime support majors, it will be available. But nevertheless, the drivers are not that good.
[07:44] <raj> how do I test if glib notifications are working?
[07:44] <Amanda2013> would anyone in here be willing to teamview meh
[07:45] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : is that on a windows 8 box that you want to dual boot
[07:45] <laze1989> Etyneo: If you are using fglrx (proprietary AMD drivers) you cannot use them with Ubuntu 12.10 out of the box (they are incompatible to Xorg 1.13, whats used in Ubuntu 12.10). But they are capable of switchting.
[07:45] <dr_willis> Amanda2013:  teqmview for what reason?
[07:46] <Tex_Nick> !uefi | Nevin
[07:46] <Nevin> No, it is a custom PC. I have Windows 7 running on it.
[07:46] <ubottu> Nevin: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI

[07:51] <dr_willis> kristof:  im on my phone  ;)
[07:51] <Nevin> Tex_Nick: How did the GRUB interface respond when you chose to install Ubuntu 12.10? (Assuming you are also using a UEFI bios.)
[07:51] <kristof> dr_willis: Aaaah. I wish I had IRC on my phone, but alas, I use a shitberry.
[07:52] <kristof> Thank you anyway!
[07:52] <SirClueless> does anyone have any knowledge of fglrx, or supporting hybrid graphics in Ubuntu?
=== ericab is now known as ericab_away
[07:52] <laze1989> Etyneo: You just need to download the newer drivers from amd http://support.amd.com/de/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx
[07:52] <SirClueless> because I can't even get 3D acceleration on my intel integrated card
[07:52] <dr_willis> hybrid is very much a 'foggy' area. sadly
[07:53] <SirClueless> dr_willis: I'd be happy to just disable the discrete card entirely
[07:53] <Ship> whats the general discussion channel
[07:53] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : i'm using an AMD ECS MoBo with UEFI, the MoBo was released from ECS about 8 month ago ... i had no problems at all
[07:53] <dr_willis> SirClueless:  that might be a setting in the bios
[07:53] <SirClueless> dr_willis: but as it is, I don't even get any 3D acceleration support
[07:53] <SirClueless> dr_willis: there isn't, my laptop is running AMD's version of this
[07:54] <dr_willis> i have no experience with hybrid gfx stuff.. dont plan on buying a laptop with it anytime soon either.
[07:54] <laze1989> Etyneo: Or use fglrx and fglrx-amdcccle (or fglrx-updates and fglrx-amdccle-updates). fglrx should be catalyst 12.4, dunno about updates packages).
[07:54] <laze1989> SirClueless: What is your graphics set up? Is it Intelel/AMD hybrid?
[07:54] <SirClueless> dr_willis: it's all a mess, I just want a basic laptop when I boot into Ubuntu
[07:55] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : the problem you're experiencing in not uncommon though ... the linux development team is working on a fix fast & hard
[07:55] <SirClueless> laze1989: yes, intel HD3000 and Radeon 7970M

[07:56] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : the issue is commonly reffered to as a "secure boot" issue
[07:56] <SirClueless> laze1989: from that link: "Warning: Works only for muxless systems."
[07:56] <SirClueless> laze1989: which I think is how mine is set up
[07:56] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : Oh ok. I have a ASRock Z77 Extreme 4 and I've been reading around that some people have gotten it to work fine for them, but it's different for me.
[07:57] <laze1989> SirClueless: Your system uses AMDs PowerXPress 4.0 or higher, which is muxless
[07:57] <SirClueless> laze1989: alright, I will give that a try, thanks for the pointer
[07:59] <laze1989> SirClueless: Hope you have installed fglrx already. If you are using Ubuntu 12.10, its not compatible with Xorg 1.13.
[08:00] <SirClueless> laze1989: I installed fglrx-updates on 12.04
[08:00] <laze1989> SirClueless: Then all will be fine.

[08:00] <dr_willis> madc|SPYnX:  if you need the latest. look for a Ppa for it
[08:01] <dr_willis> madc|SPYnX:  or use source.

[08:02] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : i didn't bother with the uefi stuff
[08:02] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : What is the live sc mean? I'm still quite new to this. :)
[08:03] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : sorry, typo ... i meant cd

[08:03] <madc|SPYnX> dr_willis, what is PPA?
[08:04] <Tex_Nick> Nevin ... you might see if your BIOS has a setting to disable "Secure Boot"
[08:04] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : I din't think it was possible to fit all of 12.10 on a CD. I do have some DVD's, would those make a difference? I figured the USB would be the same.

[08:06] <SirClueless> laze1989: should I remove fglrx-updates and fglrx-amdcccle-updates before the dkpg step?
[08:06] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : I built my system, I wouldn't see why secure boot would be enabled. I thought that was somthing that came with retail OEM systems pre-installed with Windows8.

[08:13] <Etyneo> Glad I got my laptop before Win8 and the secure boot bull...
[08:13] <dr_willis> madc|SPYnX:  no.. read the site and guide.. you normally done edit your sources.list these days
[08:13] <dr_willis> normally dont....
[08:13] <SirClueless> laze1989: hmmm, no luck, I followed those steps, still no 3D acceleration
[08:13] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : burn your ISO to DVD ... do a hash check first though ... try that
[08:14] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : My ISO is named "ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64." Does the amd64 means that it was built for AMD x64 bit processors and not Intel?
[08:14] <dr_willis> 64bit is for both
[08:14] <Etyneo> No
[08:14] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : YES ;-)
[08:15] <SirClueless> laze1989: worth mentioning? "sudo aticonfig --initial -f" reports "aticonfig: No supported adapters detected"
[08:15] <Etyneo> there were at least 2 forms of 64 bit architechture.
[08:15] <dr_willis> and the amd64 form is used by intel
[08:15] <Etyneo> Intel had one that flopped.
[08:15] <dr_willis> for the common desktop cpus
[08:16] <laze1989> SirClueless: Yea, thats worth mentioning.
[08:16] <Etyneo> then and came out with a better one that Intel adopted.
[08:16] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : My I had no idea... Is there a Intel 12.10 version?
[08:16] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : it's an x86 platform
[08:16] <Etyneo> amd...darn autocorrext
[08:16] <dr_willis> Nevin:  us 64bit works for both
[08:16] <SirClueless> laze1989: any idea what is going on?
[08:17] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : the x86 archetucture is all the same ...
[08:17] <dr_willis> Nevin:  theres an obscure/rare intel 64bit variant that you most likely will never see. ;)
[08:17] <dr_willis> common intel 64bit cpus are using amd64 extentions
[08:17] <SirClueless> laze1989: the 7970M is newer than any cards on the compatibility list at http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Hardware
[08:17] <laze1989> SirClueless: Just googled the same result
[08:18] <Etyneo> My HP had one like that.
[08:18] <raj> how can I check if glib notifications are working?
[08:18] <Nevin> Tex_Nick & dr_willis : Ok, so maybe I should be using the x86 version instead of the amd64?
[08:18] <SirClueless> laze1989: actually, scratch that, it's actually covered by "All RadeonHD 7000-series (aka Southern Islands) chips" in the "Catalyst only" section
[08:18] <dr_willis> Nevin:  i doubt it... i said  common 64bit intel cpus use amd64...
[08:18] <laze1989> SirClueless: But there should be catalyst 13.1 coming this month (propably). Maybe there is support for that. Didnt knew that it is too new, sorry.
[08:18] <SirClueless> though none of them list xxxxM variants
[08:18] <Etyneo> Turns out it was a 6700M series that had been overclocked and relabeled.

[08:20] <Nevin> dr_willis : Oh ok. Well the disc burn is finished. I will try it out, hopefully it works.
[08:20] <laze1989> SirClueless: Well. There was something called acpi_shutdown. But I think it is not developed anymore. But you have to be aware, that this can cause problems.
[08:21] <Etyneo> SirClueless: You can do that. However, both GPUs will remain powered and drawing power, even though only one is in use.
[08:21] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : to the best of my knowledge dr_willis is right there ... amd64, is a standard x86 cpu archetucture build
[08:22] <Tex_Nick> Neniv ... give me a few minutes ... let me look at that
[08:22] <Etyneo> Nevin, unless you are using s
[08:22] <SirClueless> Etyneo: even though the ATI card is designed to be powered down when not in use?
[08:23] <Etyneo> Older hardware, amd64 will work for you if you have 64 bit hardware.

[08:23] <Casey> Hey guys. I am really frustrated at this point. I have been a long time Ubuntu user and I recently bought a new Windows 7 machine and for the life of me, I cannot get it to dual boot. To put it in a nutshell, I have installed Windows 7, then used a flash drive to install Ubuntu. Installation reports no errors, however, when I restart, grub does not appear. I have tried Easy BCD, Ubuntu secure remix, grub rescue tool, etc. No matter what I
[08:23] <Casey> do, grub will not install. At the most, I got a grub rescue menu but not able to ever boot into the OS. I am using 12.10 btw. Does anyone have any ideas?

[08:24] <Etyneo> SirClueless: Yes. There US a software.switch under Windize to turn it off normally. However, Linux support ofthese sorts of hybrid card is lacking
[08:24] <dr_willis> Casey:  try a live cd and the boot-repair tool?
[08:24] <Casey> tried both
[08:25] <Casey> dr_willis
[08:25] <dr_willis> it has a log/error message feature i recall that would help people in here help you
[08:25] <Casey> dr_willis I wish I could access it.
[08:26] <Casey> I've literally no joke, installed 12.10 over 12 times under all kinds of partitioning schemes and boot sequences. None give me a difference.
[08:26] <Casey> The only thing I can think of is the EFI and UEFI boot sequences that have come out recently.
[08:26] <dr_willis> yinstall to a usb, put grub on usb.. see if that works
[08:26] <Etyneo> Also, pardon typo errors... This phone's autocorrect is annoying...
[08:27] <Casey> could you explain what you mean dr_willis
[08:27] <dr_willis> Casey:  use a live-usb. to do a full install to a second usb flash drive 8gb+...  see if it boots from that
[08:28] <dr_willis> its possible booting that usb may show the install on the hd also. and boot it

[08:34] <dr_willis> no idea.. guess it depends on what broke it. ;)
[08:34] <dr_willis> make a new user. see if it works for them. would be test  #1
[08:37] <raj> damn
[08:37] <raj> def didn't wanna do that
[08:39] <Etyneo> So, laze1989, I'm understanding that from a fresh 12.04.1 amd64 install all I need to do is go to the ATI site and get the latest Linux drivers. Is that correct?
[08:39] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : did you ever see a GRUB screen ?
[08:40] <dr_willis> raj:  its a test case...
[08:40] <dr_willis> raj:  if it works fora new user then that narrows doenn the problem area
[08:43] <raj> dr_willis, yeah, but I have a lot going on right now and my openbox is set up very specifically

[08:47] <laze1989> Etyneo: The first post.
[08:47] <dr_willis> some routers support a logging feature to monitor stuff. i forget the name. (snmpt?)
[08:48] <iceroot> joey8: have a look at the manual from your router. its specific to that device
[08:48] <joey8> iceroot➤ ah ok thanx
[08:48] <dr_willis> not really noticed that on newer routers
[08:49] <joey8> do you know if i am able to ssh into the router and run the sniff commands from there? or is that router-specific again
[08:49] <dr_willis> everything would be router sepecific
[08:51] <Nevin> dr.willis : So I did the nomodeset option in the livecd and it didn't change anything after running "Install Ubuntu." The blinking cursor froze up as well as my keyboard caps/numlock after 30 seconds.
[08:51] <dr_willis> Nevin:  so the install succeded/finished and on first boot it does that?
[08:51] <pino644> come funziona
[08:52] <dr_willis> capslock flashing = major kernel crashing.
[08:53] <Nevin> dr_willis : No it didn't have the chance to install Ubuntu. It freezes up. Caps lock didn't flash, the cursor on the console was flashing for awhile before everything froze up (including my keyboard.)
[08:57] <Nevin> dr_willis : Do you know the console with the flashing underscore cursor that comes up right after choosing "Install Ubuntu?" That's where It keeps freezing up at. Nothing loads or happens.
[08:57] <dr_willis> thats what 'nomodeset' normaly fixs.. unless the dvd/usb has errors

[09:04] <gac> Nevin: download MD5Sum from http://pc-tools.net/win32/md5sums/ then drag the ISO onto the MD5sum executable, it'll give you a checksum that you should be able to verify against those posted on the ubuntu website

[09:16] <llutz> DrCode: /mnt is a different disk, ok then
[09:16] <DrCode> sda and sdb
[09:16] <dr_willis> normally you image a partition to a file also. makes it easier to work with
[09:17] <DrCode> I can use dd to the same os that is running?
[09:17] <dr_willis> and sdb is bigger then sda i hope?
[09:17] <DrCode> or I will need to run bootcd and then dd it?
[09:17] <DrCode> yes
[09:17] <boichev> can anyone give me a tutorial how to make ubuntu boot from flash to ramdisk ? I want everything to be in ram :?
[09:17] <DrCode> it make image file
[09:17] <dr_willis> DrCode:  you can.. ive done it. but its not a great idea
[09:17] <DrCode> ok
[09:17] <Nevin> I was planning to make the partition for the Ubuntu install in the installer itself since Ubuntu uses a different file system apart from Windows NTFS.
[09:17] <dr_willis> DrCode:  a live cd would be a better idea
[09:17] <DrCode> so why I can't mount the new image?
[09:18] <DrCode> when I run sudo fdisk -lu sda.img I got error
[09:18] <DrCode> very strange
[09:18] <Tex_Nick> Nevin : ok then windows 8 has hijacked the UEFI ... so to speak
[09:18] <dr_willis> DrCode:  you have to use offtets and other options to mount if the image is a whole disk. vs a partition
[09:18] <llutz> DrCode: what is the fdisk error?
[09:18] <DrCode> but how can I find offset?
[09:18] <dr_willis> id image it from a live cd for starters
[09:19] <dr_willis> and image the partition. not the whole disk
[09:19] <DrCode> I see, it mybe damge image?
[09:19] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : The secure boot isn't enabled though. During the boot of the GNU GRUB user interface a small line of words at the top left reads out, "Secure boot is disabled."
[09:19] <dr_willis> therees some guides on using mount with whole disk images
[09:19] <DrCode> I read to use sudo fdisk -lu sda.img
[09:19] <DrCode> but got error
[09:19] <DrCode> 1 min , I will paste it
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest47244
[09:19] <DrCode> U mean to do dd if=/dev/sda1
[09:20] <DrCode> dr_willis, can U please paste link to good guide for ext4?
[09:21] <Tex_Nick> Niven : hey ... can you unplug the hard drive/s and boot up into the live DVD ?
[09:21] <llutz> DrCode: dd won't care about filesystems
[09:21] <DrCode> I see
[09:21] <DrCode> strange
[09:21] <jilebedev> I'm sorry for being irrelevant, but can anyone point me toward how I would go about finding out the pass used to encrypt a 7zip archive if I have both the archive and its extracted contents? (Again, sorry for being irrelevant, but I don't know how to search for this on google.)
[09:21] <Bor3y_> please my ubuntu it's very heavy

[09:25] <cfhowlett> BOX: greetings
[09:25] <dr_willis> and  your video chipset is what exactly?
[09:26] <BOX> hi cfhowlett
[09:26] <cfhowlett> BOX: what's your ubuntu issue?
[09:26] <Bor3y_> dr_willis : can you check my pc plz ??
[09:26] <BOX> 12.04 refuses to install for me.
[09:27] <BOX> its an old amd 64 chip.
[09:27] <cfhowlett> BOX: details?  hardware?  and you DID perform the md5sum hashcheck to verify integrity of your iso?
[09:27] <BOX> the install disk works fine on my laptop.
[09:27] <jch2os> hey guys, I have a bit of an issue. had two 8.04 boxes, that I upgraded to 10.04 and then to 12.04.  when I went to 12.04 they don't boot
[09:27] <Bor3y_> and can i transfer my ubuntu to kubuntu ??
[09:27] <BOX> 64 bit too
[09:28] <jch2os> drops to busybox initramfs, if I hit exit it will boot on the one machine
[09:28] <jch2os> the other machine seems to be stuck not fully upgraded
[09:28] <cfhowlett> BOX: ok, that suggests the ISO is fine.  also suggests a hardware issue somewhere
[09:28] <jch2os> I've been working on this for hours, so any help would be great
[09:28] <cfhowlett> Bor3y_: transfer?  no.  If you prefer kubuntu, just install the kde desktop
[09:28] <BOX> maybe just because im not grat with linux.
[09:29] <BOX> installs okay, or so it would seem.
[09:29] <cfhowlett> BOX: one thing at a time.  How OLD is this computer your working with?
[09:29] <Bor3y_> how i can install KDE desktop ??
[09:29] <cfhowlett> Bor3y_: sudo apt-get install kde-desktop if I'm not mistaken
[09:29] <BOX> i would guess around 5 years old.
[09:29] <cfhowlett> BOX: ram?
[09:29] <optraz> is there a way to install opera browser easily other than going to the opera website, download deb package and isntasll ?
[09:29] <BOX> 2
[09:30] <cfhowlett> BOX: have your tried 32 bit ubuntu on this box?  2 gigs of ram seems low for a 64 bit machine ...
[09:30] <Bor3y_> it tell me unable to locate kde pachage
[09:30] <BOX> yes, 32 bit doesnt work either.  infact i havent made myself clear.

[09:32] <BOX> the guest option does work though
[09:32] <dr_willis> thats very weird
[09:32] <BOX> nope, loads to then login screen.

[09:33] <dr_willis> can your user login at the console?
[09:33] <BOX> main user account doesnt work, accepts psword but then flicks back to login screen. guest loads desktop,
[09:33] <Bor3y_> but how i can instgall it ?
[09:34] <dr_willis> BOX:  try the console. sounds like x/unity is crashing
[09:34] <BOX> and ctrl alt something to get a prompt allows me to login with the user / pass i setup.

[09:38] <MacroMan> Hi, possible to boot straight into terminal upon boot? I've seen how to do this permanantly, but I only need once as I currently can't boot my machine
[09:38] <dr_willis> append the text option to the boot line MacroMan
[09:39] <BOX> Bor3y_,  why cant you install it?  or you just starting to learn?  if so look at http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
[09:39] <dr_willis> MacroMan:    quiet text splash
[09:39] <MacroMan> dr_willis, How do I do that?
[09:39] <dr_willis> MacroMan:  at the  grub menu. its edit featuuure
[09:39] <dr_willis> !text
[09:39] <ubottu> To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode

[10:11] <llutz> frank: use apt-get --no-install-recommends
[10:11] <Emanon> Hey all, how do I bridge wireless connections in 12.10?
[10:12] <Emanon> Or whatever it is when you make multiple connections act as one.
[10:12] <cargo122> linux give you opportunity to change ALL any time- and that is whi it is cool))
[10:15] <Emanon> Any takers? I've got two separate wireless networks with their own internet connections, is there a way for me to treat them as one connection so they share the load?
[10:15] <Gavilan2> Emanon: Probably yes...
[10:16] <Gavilan2> Emanon: But make sure your wifi networks are really fast and don't use the same "frequency"...
[10:17] <Emanon> Hold on, I'll check the channels.
[10:17] <rekoil> Emanon: for a setup like that it's usually best if they are networked via ethernet, are they?
[10:17] <Emanon> No, they are two separate public hotspots I want to treat like one.
[10:17] <Gavilan2> rekoil: I suspect he is probably not the owner of the wifis xD
[10:18] <AndreaUbuntu> v4l-info gives out good info about my webcam....but whenever i test on gstreamer-properties, or guvcview or cheese, i get the error-->  libv4l2: error turning on stream: No such device .... whats up?
[10:18] <Emanon> And I'd like to do it without interfering with their settings as much as possible. People don't like it when you "optimize" their wifi.
[10:18] <Emanon> If they find out...
[10:18] <PeterGriffin> Can I add the exceptions for tar in a file and add the file in the tar line

[10:24] <Emanon> I don't have multiple devices with only one connection I have one device and multiple connections.
[10:25] <night_wolf> the buttons are still on the left, im running ubuntu 12.10 x64
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[10:27] <Tex_Nick> Emanon  : the issue is specific to the two access points ... as well as the cloud connectors ... it's normally done at that level ... i suppose it could be implemented through software... but the end result would probably result in network degregation & bottlenecks
[10:28] <bor3y> hii
[10:28] <Emanon> Right, Tex_Nick That's what happens when I just connect to both of them at once with different adapters.
[10:28] <bor3y> i want to tell everybody the kubuntu desktop it's very great

[10:32] <night_wolf> nobody knows how i can change the window button order to the left?
[10:33] <night_wolf> to the right i mean, i tried with gconf-editor but they are still on the left side...
[10:33] <Emanon> I don't know how to change the order but I know Ubuntu tweak can put them on the right side.
[10:34] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : ok ... best bet is to do it at the hardware level ... you'll need two routers on each wire capable of bonding to each other
[10:34] <night_wolf> can i install ubuntu tweak or?
[10:35] <Emanon> I should warn you, though it is nice and I haven't had any problems with it I think #ubuntu frowns upon it, so upon your own head be it. That said: http://ubuntu-tweak.com/
[10:37] <night_wolf> for 11.10? does it run in 12.10?
[10:37] <Emanon> That thing that says 11.10 is a link to the older versions.

[10:40] <Emanon> So Tex_Nick There isn't a software solution, thank you for your help you've at least let me know what it was called so I can do further research on my own.
[10:41] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : if you just need to do it at a software level, have a look at this

[10:46] <Emanon> Or, Cloaky, if you have dcfldd: dcfldd if=/dev/<your install partition> of=/dev/<external drive>/path/to/file/you/want.img
[10:46] <Emanon> Then just dd (or dcfldd) the img back to your drive to restore.
[10:48] <Cloaky> Thanks Emanon I'll give that a go... Do you know if there is a GUI to do this? I'm no stranger to the command line, but I have other family members who also use Ubuntu
[10:49] <Emanon> Not sure, you could make them a shell script to click.
[10:49] <Emanon> Just make sure you define the drives in question by uuid instead of /dev/sd*
[10:49] <Emanon> So they are always found properly.
=== Vobine is now known as Psychoholic
[10:49] <Cloaky> nice one
[10:50] <Cloaky> thanks for the help
[10:50] <Emanon> Cloaky: /dev/disk/by-uuid/<whatever the drive's uuid is>
[10:52] <Emanon> You could even set the script to run on a time or after certain events.
[10:52] <Emanon> It takes a while to do a whole drive though...
[10:52] <Emanon> Took me like an hour or so to zero out three 500g SATAs with dcfldd I think.
[10:53] <Cloaky> right... TBH I would like "the job" to be kicked off manually
[10:53] <Cloaky> what about some of the backup apps in the software centre?
[10:54] <Emanon> IDK, I've never used them.
[10:54] <Cloaky> any recommendations?
[10:54] <Emanon> Uh, hold on.
[10:54] <evol> ello
[10:55] <evol> looking for some help anyone willing
[10:56] <Emanon> I think deja dup comes standard with 12.10 doesn't it Cloaky?
[10:56] <Emanon> Though I don't know if it can do bitstream backups.
[10:56] <Cloaky> not too sure... still 12.04
[10:57] <Emanon> I'm just approaching this from a forensics standpoint and dd (as well as it's forks and patch dc3dd and dcfldd) are just the cleanest/fastest ways that I know of.
[10:57] <evol> sooooo fill take that as a no ?
[10:58] <Emanon> !ask >evol
[10:58] <ubottu> evol, please see my private message
[10:58] <Cloaky> cool... just reading up on dd... gunna do some testing
[10:58] <Cloaky> many thanks for the pointer
[10:59] <Emanon> For reference dcfldd and dc3dd have a few extra features (if memory serves) that dd doesn't.
[10:59] <Emanon> Features that make them excellent for saving data from failing drives.
[10:59] <llutz> Cloaky: you'd better look at solutions like rsnapshot than waisting diskspace for images as backups
[11:00] <Emanon> That sounds like a pretty good idea llutz

[11:02] <evol> also tried usb install as well same thing there
=== sburjan_ is now known as sburjan`
[11:03] <Emanon> Could it be because window 8 certified (and preinstalled) devices use uefi to prevent people from tampering with the OS as a "security" (read: "vendor lock-in") measure?
[11:03] <Emanon> Try booting the USB in UEFI mode.
[11:04] <evol> turned off secure boot and changed uefi to csm in bios settings
[11:04] <evol> also tried to boot usb in uefi all i got there was a black scren
[11:05] <Emanon> Bummer, have you tried 12.10? I've heard some anecdotal accounts of it playing nicer with uefi.
[11:05] <evol> no i didn't try that went with the latest lts release
[11:06] <evol> may have to attempt that and see where that goes
[11:06] <eos_> hi everybody! is there a CLI command to list all the repositories and ppas?
[11:06] <Emanon> Makes sense to stick with LTS I agree but sometimes the non LTS have some newer stuff.

[11:07] <evol> im just about annoyed with this laptop in general i couldnt even downgrade to win 7 because there was no driver support
[11:08] <evol> fill try 12.10 and hope for the best
[11:08] <eos_> Emanon: thanks .... but I was hoping a command existed to manage repositories and ppa
[11:08] <evol> thanks for the input tho
[11:08] <Emanon> Or eos_  egrep -v '^#|^ *$' /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/* to do it while removing blank lines and commented out lines.
[11:09] <AndreaUbuntu> v4l-info gives out good info about my webcam....but whenever i test on gstreamer-properties, or guvcview or cheese, i get the error-->  libv4l2: error turning on stream: No such device .... whats up?
[11:09] <Emanon> askubuntu has some cool questions answered eos_ http://askubuntu.com/questions/148932/list-all-repositories-and-ppa-from-command-line
[11:10] <ganesha> hi?\
[11:10] <AndreaUbuntu> Emanon, i've found 12.10 much more pleasant overall....i dont consider 12.04 of real LTS quality....
[11:10] <Emanon> Is your camera at /dev/video* perhaps AndreaUbuntu ?
[11:10] <eos_> Emanon: thanks, I had already seen it .... what I was looking for is a set of command or packages to manage the repositories without resorting to grep and company
[11:11] <AndreaUbuntu> Emanon, yes...but it shift from /dev/video0 to /dev/video1 every time i start some program....keeps shifting over
[11:11] <ganesha> he hi
[11:11] <ganesha> hiiiIIIIIII
[11:11] <eos_> Emanon: I thought that everybody has the same problem, ther eshould be something available out there

[11:12] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : you might also want to explore network bridging ... wikipedia has the best description i could find fast ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_%28networking%29
[11:12] <ganesha> what
[11:12] <AndreaUbuntu> Emanon, thanks :)
[11:13] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : you can also implement that thru software ... ubuntu has links ... google @,@
[11:15] <Emanon> Thanks Tex_Nick That's actually where I went to check for external links before I came here hehe.
[11:16] <AndreaUbuntu> I prefer Unity to all other DE's...its clean, minimalistic, doesn't overwhelm you with details.....one thing I find an issue is that searching in the dash is slow....like icons take a while to load etc.
[11:17] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : i've done a lot of that stuff in the past, even with satellite links ... always with hardware though ... can get crazy ... tis geek play though
[11:17] <eos_> Emanon: I ambtrying to go back to a vanilla installation to fix some problems I have been experiencing
[11:18] <Emanon> I'm fond of Unity myself but KDE is where I started and Gnome was my first big UI shift so I have a certain nostalgia for both of them too AndreaUbuntu.
[11:18] <eos_> Emanon: If I can list all ppa then ppa-purge them, I should possibly be able to sort the problem
[11:18] <Emanon> Yea, Tex_Nick I just bought an ALFA awus036nh.
[11:19] <Emanon> Oh, that's somewhat easier eos_ Have you tried Y-PPA-manager?
[11:19] <mrthg> really can't agree with unity, it just annoyes me for some odd reason
[11:19] <eos_> Emanon: nope ....
[11:19] <Emanon> Hold on eos_ I'll get you a link.
[11:19] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : how do you like it
[11:19] <AndreaUbuntu> 7 yrs ago (when i first started using Linux) i went to KDE since it was the more 'Windows-like' from what the internet said....but eventually i found that gnome seemd more simplistic, and pleasant visually. I like it's organisation better....though I admit I haven't used KDE since 3.x....so no idea how it feels todsy...still looks "too much" from screenshots/vidz though. Unity is now lovely in my opinion.....graphically its wonderful....just
[11:19] <AndreaUbuntu> these various graphical lags bug me...and most probably it has to do with compiz more than Unity itself :/
[11:20] <Emanon> It's quite nice once you tell it you're in bolivia...
[11:21] <eos_> Emanon: Thanks a lot ....
[11:21] <gvandeweyer> does anybody have experience in setting up IP-tables to access an nfs-server behind nat?

[11:22] <AndreaUbuntu> I've tried Cinnamon on Mint 14 a while bk....whilst it seemed snappier than Unity overall...it had the same overwhelming feeling KDE gave me...i didnt feel comfortable with it...too many things to 'look at' if you know what i mean

[11:23] <Emanon> AndreaUbuntu: Mint is nice. I think it's wm is Cinnamon now isn't it?
[11:24] <AndreaUbuntu> yes Cinnamon
[11:24] <AndreaUbuntu> but it seemed they've done to GNOME what KDE has....over-detailed stuff, text, notifications etc.
[11:24] <Emanon> But it can go to 2W tx power and came standard with a 5dBm omni and a 7dBm paddle antenna Tex_Nick.
[11:25] <Emanon> AndreaUbuntu: To each their own in Linux.
[11:25] <ichat> AndreaUbuntu,  - cynamon  as opsed to thair   gnome2 junk mate is actually a really nice,  DE,   but its   A large,  B not as stable as   it has to be to use it on a production machine... ie  your comanpy desktop...
[11:26] <AndreaUbuntu> Well, Emanon & ichat....choice is good :) I'll stick to Unity for the time being....but i'd love it if they made compiz a little less laggy
[11:26] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : did you have to tell itit was south of the equator ;-)
[11:26] <Emanon> Good luck, that's like simplifying xorg

[11:27] <ichat> i have been using it  my personal work laptop for  over  a year  it was a 17inc   1600x900  screen.. but my new   1366x768 ultrabook was just to small for it... and i found that after a long road of personally dislike    unity finally proved a point...
[11:27] <AndreaUbuntu> i love mint's refined stuff though....for example my webcam worked out of the box with mint 14....does not with Ubuntu 12.10...and after a WEEK of trying, it still does not
[11:27] <AndreaUbuntu> yes Unity is great on a small laptop screen :)
[11:27] <Emanon> I have to mod a transmit profile to go to 2W though. BO standard top end is 1W.
[11:28] <Emanon> That sucks. I remember when you flat couldn't get most mainstream wifi adapters working without ndiswrapper AndreaUbuntu.
[11:28] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : yeah in south america ... why was that an issue ?
=== sburjan_ is now known as sburjan`
[11:28] <AndreaUbuntu> Emanon, i remmebr that too :D
[11:28] <Emanon> Why was what an issue Tex_Nick?
[11:28] <ichat> AndreaUbuntu,  -  im really wondering what  webcam than.. because  afaik  mint 14 is based on the same ubuntu kernel??? is it not?
[11:29] <AndreaUbuntu> I'm curious about Elementary when it finally (if it does) come out of beta.....the only issue seems that unless you use 'their' apps, the UI is not so consistent after all
[11:29] <AndreaUbuntu> ichat, yes same kernel...which boggles the mind too....it's an integrated HP TrueVision HD cam....it's detected fine...just won't work though
[11:29] <dr_willis> amazing thing about consistent UI's is how quickly they can get dumped. ;)
[11:30] <Emanon> BTW is there anyway I can use the motion controls on my Logitech Camera in 12.10?
[11:30] <Tex_Nick> Emanon : you said ... It's quite nice once you tell it you're in bolivia... was wondering about that
[11:30] <AndreaUbuntu> dr_willis - it is  however, desirable :)
[11:30] <AndreaUbuntu> v4l-info gives out good info about my webcam....but whenever i test on gstreamer-properties, or guvcview or cheese, i get the error-->  libv4l2: error turning on stream: No such device .... whats up?

[11:31] <dr_willis> katarakt:  you could always use some sort of grep/awk/sed filter
[11:31] <Emanon> Nah, no issue. "ifconfig wlan3 down && iw reg set BO && ifconfig wlan3 up" and it's done.
[11:31] <MonkeyDust> katarakt  use awk to extract words from output
[11:31] <MonkeyDust> dr_willis  was faster :)
[11:32] <katarakt> Thanks....nice and simple solution

[11:35] <YolarP> Hi. I'm fairly new to Ubuntu and don't have insight into the state of certain things. Can someone please tell me which is the most popular DE for Ubuntu, or even Linux in general if it applies? I tired Googling but got a bunch of conflicting or unreliable answers. Thanks.
[11:35] <Guest75120> I'm looking for templates for LibreOffice.  I am looking to make a CV for a job.  Where can I find that or a word processor that can do that?
[11:35] <dr_willis> YolarP:  the default for Ubuntu is Unity.
[11:35] <ichat> AndreaUbuntu,   - minecraft being the b est of them :P
[11:35] <ichat> sorry lool
[11:35] <Emanon> I'd like to mount it on my phone and use a super-directional cantenna so that I could write a script to read gps coords, heading, pitch and signal strength so I could just spin around with my monstrosity in hand and have gps coords for all the networks near me.
[11:35] <Emanon> Hold on, I've got to bring network down and back  up.
[11:35] <AndreaUbuntu> lol
[11:35] <YolarP> dr_willis: Is it the most popular DE?
[11:36] <YolarP> If there are any such insights.
[11:36] <YolarP> Maybe I should ask in #linux.
[11:36] <MonkeyDust> YolarP  try a few DE's an decide which you prefer
[11:36] <dr_willis> YolarP:  I dont know of any reliable poleing sites.. :) Ubuntu uses Unity, Kubuntu uses KDE. Luuntu uses LXDE.
[11:36] <AndreaUbuntu> YolarP, if you are new, i'd stick to the default on Ubuntu, which is Unity....but you can change later on
[11:36] <YolarP> Okay, thanks people.
[11:37] <YolarP> As usual you're the best. :)
[11:37] <AndreaUbuntu> it's very visual, clear, easy.....
[11:37] <AndreaUbuntu> later on you might prefer something else perhaps, but for starters, and even for long-time users like me, it works well :)

[11:38] <YolarP> So thanks. :)
[11:38] <ichat> AndreaUbuntu,  -  as long as its on a small screen it looks perfect (or allmost) but on a  larger screen i kinda more like the multi-windows   not as compact approach where multi-tasking works mutch  better...
[11:39] <AndreaUbuntu> DE's equate to flame wars usually...everybody llikes something different....Unity has a corporate feel though :)
[11:39] <dr_willis> YolarP:  your question dident really have a straightforward answer. ;P
[11:39] <YolarP> Okay, a relevant answer*
[11:39] <YolarP> rather than WHY ARE YOU ASKING THIS???!?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN POPULAR?!
[11:39] <YolarP> Which is like, the most annoying thing ever.
[11:40] <Emanon> Back.
[11:40] <AndreaUbuntu> ichat - yes i miss having window tabs.....I wonder if Unity could implement a way to rpeview multiple windows when you have multiple instances of the same program open....so that its easier to choose...
[11:40] <Emanon> Lol. compiz crashed.
[11:40] <nickalex> aiuto
[11:41] <villev_> I have created an upstart job in /etc/init, but the service doesn't show up. how to debug this?
[11:41] <mrthg> that sounds familiar (compiz crashing)
[11:41] <AndreaUbuntu> Emanon, it does sometimes :)
[11:41] <ichat> and auto-hide dockbar like in gnome 2 ... as an exention / pluggin would be perfect
[11:41] <Emanon> No biggie.
[11:41] <Emanon> Still better than Windoze.
[11:41] <dr_willis> theres docks that work  like that. ;)
[11:41] <AndreaUbuntu> ichat, yes....right now u have to click open all windows of an app...then an app-expose comes up eventually....really gets in the way!
[11:42] <AndreaUbuntu> dr_willis - yes but i want the stock one to work well out of the box...
[11:42] <nickalex> come avere lalista grazzie
[11:42] <AndreaUbuntu> one dock is enough on a small screen :)
[11:43] <AndreaUbuntu> so hwo about 1) hover on the launcher icon that has multiple instances open 2) small thumbnail previews come up 3) you click on the one you want

[11:44] <AndreaUbuntu> especially for big screens.
[11:44] <Guest47431> cuz ive got xubuntu installed and i wanted it to be a server so how do i do it

[12:02] <ichat> krypedbbkick,  - if your a small hacker you must be  equiped with good reading skilles ... aka    you know what im gonna say next
[12:02] <krypedbbkick> um kind of its basicly for my games and to have multiplayer attached to them but yea web server
[12:02] <sevenforall> Emanon: Exactly
[12:02] <krypedbbkick> yeas c++ javascript php and html
[12:02] <MonkeyDust> krypedbbkick  start here http://www.serverubuntu.it/
[12:03] <krypedbbkick> k thank you
[12:03] <mrthg> hum my tor crashed :(
[12:03] <sevenforall> I have a basic tutorial on how to set up LAMP, or more of a spoonfeeding page, but I don't think that's what you're looking for
[12:03] <alo21> hi... can someone tell me what zeitgeist really does, please?
[12:03] <krypedbbkick> well right now anything that can teach me how to work these things will do for now
[12:03] <krypedbbkick> i plan on taking my skills to the next lvl in collage
[12:04] <MonkeyDust> krypedbbkick  and this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP
[12:04] <dr_willis> alo21:  it like a datalogger keeping trackof how much time you spend in differnt apps and with what files and other metrics.
[12:04] <Emanon> alo21: Zeitgeist (framework), a GNOME 3.0 activity logging system similar to Lifestream
[12:04] <Emanon> alo21: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist_%28framework%29
[12:04] <dr_willis> alo21:  theres some data 'graphing' extras it has if you want to see how much time for example yovue spend editing differnt ifles or in other apps
[12:05] <AndreaUbuntu> or procrastinating on Facebook :P
[12:05] <alo21> dr_willis, Emanon can zeitgeist know if an instance of an application is open yet?
[12:05] <dr_willis> alo21:  no idea.  I rarely use it.
[12:05] <Emanon> No idea alo21 I just googled what it was and that came up in wikipedia.
[12:06] <dr_willis> its not clear what you mean :)
[12:06] <dr_willis> The apps have to support logging to zeitguist also.
[12:06] <krypedbbkick> so hay sevenforall you go to itt tech?
[12:07] <guilherme_> Hey guys, need some help: I have a VirtualBox installation of Ubuntu Server 12.04 (LTS), and I'm having problems adding new virtual network cards to it, even though they are recognized by hardware, they do not show up on ifconfig and thus do not join the network. How may I add several interfaces?
[12:07] <krypedbbkick> oh and monkeydust dose it matter if im running xubunta
[12:08] <sevenforall> krypedbbkick: I'm afraid not, why so?
[12:08] <ichat> did you restart the network service   after adding the new devices...  guilherme_
[12:08] <guilherme_> yes, restarted and rebooted the machine, no go :(
[12:08] <krypedbbkick> becuz i couldnt ever find the right iso for ubuntu so i came across xubuntu and thats wut im running now
[12:09] <krypedbbkick> i mean i will install ubunta if i need to i can get any iso for free but i just need to now
[12:11] <dr_willis> Not sure whats so hard about finding the Ubuntu iso.. :)
[12:12] <krypedbbkick> im running a very old windows xp and everytime i tried to install ubuntu on there it kept saying the bit for my cp was a i86 and i tried both 32 and 64
[12:12] <ichat> krypedbbkick,    just follow the tutorials,   otherwise your only making it harder on yourself, get into trouble and stress the fee support that your offered  for not good reason...   so please dont  be an ass and follow the links you where given...  and only start with the hard stuff when your ready
[12:12] <dr_willis> krypedbbkick:   if the cpu dosent support PAE. you will need 12.04
[12:12] <krypedbbkick> wut do u mean how am i being an ass may i ask
[12:12] <krypedbbkick> kk

[12:14] <blami> dr_willis: ubuntu dropped non-PAE kernels?
[12:14] <daimoh> all.. i'm hoping someone can help me salvage my ubuntu upgrade - it died halfway through and now grub comes up with an "out of range" on my monitor
[12:14] <dr_willis> blami:  in 12.10 yes.
[12:14] <AndroUser> ...

[12:15] <dr_willis> daimoh:  does it boot to the desktop at all?
=== andrew_ is now known as grandrew
[12:15] <daimoh> nope, no desktop at all
[12:15] <daimoh> just sits at "out of range"
[12:15] <dr_willis> daimoh:  tried the nomodeset option?
[12:16] <daimoh> i see "grub loading" and then it is out of range.
[12:16] <AndreaUbuntu> dm1 4425-ea is the model
[12:16] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[12:16] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[12:16] <daimoh> ah great, i'll try that - thanks dr_willis
[12:16] <ichat> diamoh  append  nomodset  your  boot option in grub than boot and fix your  (nvidia????) driver  to corret settings
[12:17] <jrtappers> is it possible to have different wallpapers on cinamon, Gnome 3, KDE and unity
[12:17] <jrtappers> I can only chnage the KDE one independantly
[12:17] <dr_willis> jrtappers:  some of the desktops use the same gconf settings.
[12:17] <dr_willis> or dconf.
[12:18] <jrtappers> dr_willis, is there a way to override that? or trick it?
[12:18] <dr_willis> jrtappers:  never really worreied about it. or tried. ;)
[12:18] <dr_willis> Use some wallpaper randomizer ;P
[12:18] <daimoh> ichat - i can't get to edit the grub config, as i think it's grub that's causing the out-of-range problem
[12:19] <dr_willis> daimoh:  ive seen where grub gives the Out of range message.. Untill Lightdm/X starts up.
[12:20] <daimoh> dr_willis: yes, me too - I tried leaving it for a good 20 minutes to see if anything would come up. alas, no it did not.
[12:20] <daimoh> problem is, i don't see anything come up at all
[12:20] <daimoh> it goes straight from the bios loading, to an "out of range"
[12:20] <daimoh> i have no idea what's going on in the background.
[12:21] <daimoh> i just rebooted from the USB live CD, hit the nomodeset option, and then "try ubuntu without installing" and it started booting.. and now it has "out of range"
[12:22] <daimoh> pressing "shift" after the bios stuff doesn't seem to make any difference - which makes me think it's grub that's causing "out of range"

[12:24] <ServerPawn> I just installed Unbutu to dual boot on a win 8 machine, however now when I select Ubuntu as the OS to start it takes me to a screen where it says file \ubuntu\winboot\wubildir.mbr isnt working. then gives a status of OxC000007B. Any ideas how to fix this, first time Ubuntu user...sorry if this is a silly question
[12:24] <daimoh> any other ideas?
[12:25] <ichat> daimoh,  - duhhh
[12:25] <ichat> nope
[12:26] <ichat> ServerPawn,  -  no experience with win8 - i remove it the minute after  i got the machine
[12:26] <daimoh> *sigh* i'll never understand why grub has to be all pretty.. what's wrong with a simple console..

[12:27] <ichat> daimoh,  - hah back iin the day when you had lilo :P
[12:27] <blami> daimoh: I am using gummiboot
[12:27] <daimoh> ichat - exactly! at least you knew what was going on with lilo!
[12:27] <blami> daimoh: which is single C file bootloader that does not have that useless cruft
[12:27] <ichat> daimoh,  - hell yah
[12:28] <ichat> blami,  is it  just for bios...  or does efi work too
[12:29] <daimoh> blami - i'm mid-way through an upgrade to 12.10… trying to change boot loaders may just melt my brain.
[12:29] <dr_willis> Upgrades failing...... is not a good sign. ;)
[12:30] <dr_willis> a potential sign that a reinstall is in your near future
[12:31] <daimoh> a reinstall will kill me.. i have a massive mythtv install that i just simply cannot lose!
[12:31] <blami> ichat: gummiboot is efi only
[12:31] <WeThePeople> dr_willis, have you solved any issues with 'cannot write broken pipes'?
[12:31] <blami> ichat: it only loads other efi stubs ... it's dead plain ...
[12:32] <dr_willis> WeThePeople:  seen the message mentioned befor. ive even seen it on my working systems..
[12:32] <dr_willis> WeThePeople:  never had to fix it.
[12:32] <claudiu_> 10.04 Why when i log out the screen is pixelated? Instead of a clean black screen? This is after i installed nvidia proprietary graphics driver.
[12:32] <daimoh> so i've booted up off the usb drive now and I have the desktop up - how can i fix up the HD so it at least boots in a video mode the card/monitor supports?
[12:33] <dr_willis> claudiu_:  you mean the consoles when you Exit out of X ?
[12:33] <dr_willis> daimoh:  you could try reinstalling grub. and setting it to use TEXT mode and a Text based grub menu . so you can at least see grub and any error messages.
[12:34] <claudiu_> When I shutdown the laptop.
[12:34] <daimoh> dr_willis: that would be ideal - how can i reinstall grub on a disk i didn't boot from though?
[12:34] <daimoh> for instance, i have the HD mounted in /mnt
[12:34] <daimoh> it's /mnt/sda1
[12:34] <dr_willis> daimoh:  that boot-repair tool mentioned in the !fixgrub wiki

[12:38] <arshavin> can't mount android sd card in ubuntu either automatically or manually anybody got any idea
[12:42] <Emanon> Like the sd by itself or when it's in the android device?
[12:44] <arshavin> Emanon: I gues so
[12:44] <Emanon> Which?
[12:44] <dr_willis> gotta love exacting answers. ;)
[12:44] <ridolien> Anyone using Extreme Networks Equipment here?
[12:44] <arshavin> when is android device
[12:44] <mrthg> which item on a given server increases, when a web server's gets more http requests to proces
[12:44] <dr_willis> arshavin:  and what android version is on the devcice?
[12:44] <arshavin> GB
[12:45] <ridolien> mrthg, the number of http requests increases
=== dennis_ is now known as koderde
[12:45] <Emanon> Is have you selected "Turn on USB storage" when you plug in the device arshavin ?
[12:45] <arshavin> dr_willis: ginger bread,it never really mounts,
[12:45] <Emanon> Is that even an option in GB?
[12:45] <arshavin> Emanon : yes
[12:45] <mrthg> like when more people approach the server via browser
[12:45] <dr_willis> Theres some posts/articals on the OMGubuntu site and WEbupd8 blog sites on how to mount android devices that use that MTP method.
[12:46] <arshavin> Emanon : yes,it is na option but nothing shows up
[12:46] <magik_> Good morning everyone
[12:46] <Emanon> Is the device unlocked?
[12:46] <dr_willis> I just use ssh/wirelless tools to transfer stuff to my phones.
[12:46] <arshavin> Emanon : Yes, it is unlocked
[12:46] <Emanon> Was it when you plugged it in?
[12:46] <ridolien> arshavin, there is definately a package installation required to support android filesystem mounting in Ubuntu
[12:47] <arshavin> I actually need to partition my sdcard using fdisk so ssh won't help
=== ridolien is now known as plagerism
[12:47] <Emanon> Yea, IDK about GB but JB just mounts as a USB device, no help to arshavin though.
[12:47] <dr_willis> arshavin:  y dint think you are going to partion it over usb, while its in the phone.
[12:48] <Emanon> You could try flashing TWRP if there is a version for your device and mounting it as USB from there.
[12:48] <arshavin> dr_willis: i have done that
[12:48] <dr_willis> i cant even imagine why you need to partion it really. ;)
[12:48] <arshavin> Emanon : what is this TWRP
[12:48] <dr_willis> Night all. have fun.
[12:48] <Emanon> It's a recovery image, like ClockWorkMod Recovery.
[12:48] <arshavin> dr_willis: a2sd stuff
[12:49] <Emanon> http://teamw.in/project/twrp2
[12:49] <maxb> Android seems to be aggressively deprecating USB mass storage support, my One X lost that in favour of MTP when updated from ICS to JB
[12:50] <daimoh> dr_willis: reinstalling grub looks like it might have done the trick for me.. i've successfully booted off the HD in recovery mode - many, many thanks.
[12:50] <Emanon> I AM using a custom rom maxb so...
[12:50] <Emanon> But if he has root he can flash twrp and do it from there independent of android itself.
[12:51] <arshavin> Emanon: well my old sgy just wouldn't accept any custom roms since i flashed it with some bad options in odin
[12:51] <Emanon> Do you have root?
[12:52] <arshavin> Emanon: I lost root after flashing with stock rom now I am badly stuck I already have cwm.zip but ccant flash it
[12:52] <Emanon> Ouch.
[12:52] <Emanon> Can you get it to go into adb and detect it that way?
[12:52] <arshavin> yes adb works fine but without root it's useless
[12:53] <ElysiumNet> when grub-pc asks me to install it on all partitions, should I install it on the partitions that are in the raid, or on the raid itself?
[12:53] <Emanon> Hold on, I'm looking up the SGY
[12:53] <magik_> I have a question it is kind of off topic but if anyone has an answer for me that would be much appreciated,  I live in a small town and there is only a few places here that do computer work but they charge a fortune.  If I wanted to open up my own repair center would I need to get a special license and insurance or can I use a disclaimer anyone have a link with information about that?
[12:53] <arshavin> i can push files to my sdccard but after rebooting the device they dissapear
[12:53] <Emanon> Aww that's a cute lil phone.
[12:54] <ElysiumNet> magik_: IANAL, but I think you just need to get the basic business requirements
[12:54] <ElysiumNet> registered business, paying taxes, bookkeeping, etc
[12:54] <arshavin> yea it's nice but without custom roms it seems boring
[12:54] <ElysiumNet> the liability/insurance thing should be rolled up into when setting up a business as well
[12:55] <magik_> k, but I would need some form of insurance incase someone complains right?
[12:55] <gac> magik_: depends which country you're in, but you'd need whatever any other physical shop in your area needs (i.e. maybe public liability insurance for your premises to protect customers, insurance against being broken into, etc)
[12:55] <Emanon> And you say ODIN no longer works at all?
[12:55] <ElysiumNet> gac: I think he means insurance against accidentily wrecking a computer, or having to announce a computer as wrecked
[12:55] <arshavin> odin works but flashin custom roms does not work
[12:55] <ElysiumNet> since he mentioned *repair* shop
[12:56] <gac> I wouldn't think there is such an insurance policy? or it'd be covered by the accidental damage portion of the contents insurance
[12:56] <ElysiumNet> gac: who do you charge if the car mechanic breaks something?
[12:56] <magik_> Ok thanks allot guys I appreciate the info
[12:56] <Emanon> That's weird it's not supposed to be able to deny a forced flash from download mode
[12:56] <gac> as a customer, I hold the garage responsible, where the garage get the money from isn't my business
[12:56] <gac> they may just pay the cost, they may claim off their public liability insurance, whatever
[12:57] <ElysiumNet> gac: and what if it's something that broke due to time? and it just happened to be in the garage's hands
[12:57] <ElysiumNet> or it was already a piece of crap car to begin with that has been festering for decades
[12:57] <arshavin> actually i use cwm recovery to flash custom roms in .zip files and stock rom with odin works fine
[12:57] <gac> again, not my problem, if the garage hand back a car with a different fault to what it went in with then it's up to them to fix as far as I'm concerned
[12:58] <ElysiumNet> I'm pretty sure car garages don't just outright decline to fix cars; or do they?
[12:58] <KM0201> gac: lmao, you're full of it.
[12:58] <gac> unless they can prove beyond all doubt that the work they did couldn't possibly have caused it
[12:58] <ElysiumNet> gac: I'm playing the evil client here. you know, the one with oil and chocolate smeared all over and inside of a SNES
[12:58] <KM0201> trusdt me on this... they are not liable in the situation you describe.
[12:58] <ElysiumNet> and having louched it in baby poo
[12:58] <gac> KM0201: I'm not, I've been in that situation at least twice. had a car back with a fault it didn't have when it went in, been fixed at no cost each time
[12:58] <Emanon> arshavin: So can you flash a rooted rom from cwm?
[12:58] <gac> fairly minor cost (couple of hundred pounds, tops) admittedly, not thousands
[12:59] <gac> but they still paid
[12:59] <KM0201> gac: you're full of it, trust me.. i've probably been in that situation way wya more than you (on the business side) and i've told MANY people like you to pound sand.. they kick and scream, and threaten with l awyers, i just chuckle, and tell them to bring it
[13:00] <KM0201> just because i'm working on something, and something else breaks, doesn't mena i'm responsible to fix it, unless i deliberately or through negligence,k broke it.
[13:00] <arshavin> no that stopped working since i checked extra options in odin
[13:00] <ElysiumNet> anyway, grub is asking me to install to all partitions... should I install it to all partitions, or just to /dev/md1?
[13:00] <gac> KM0201: then you probably wouldn't see my business again ;) but that's your prerogative and it may be a UK/US difference. All I know is that I've had no problems in the past in this situation as a customer
[13:00] <ElysiumNet> gac: we probably wouldn't want to see your business again :P
[13:00] <KM0201> gac: and w/ that attitude, i wouldn't want it to be frank.
[13:01] <gac> again, your choice :)
[13:01] <ElysiumNet> "Here is this crap that will definitely break if you even more than just glance at it!"
[13:01] <KM0201> some customers, are just to big a PITA to keep... you have to make a decision.
=== BradCrittenden is now known as bac
[13:01] <ElysiumNet> "And you'll pay me for EVERY SINGLE PENNY for this WORTHLESS steaming pile of crap"
[13:01] <Emanon> Wow, arshavin that's completely beyond my ability to fix have you tried at xda?
[13:01] <ElysiumNet> it's called the reverse scam
[13:02] <Emanon> Or can you reset CWM to factory?
[13:02] <gac> but if I got a piece of equipment back with a fault it didn't have when I handed it over, I certainly wouldn't just hand over my own money unless there was a very good reason (for example the engine broke while the garage were changing a rear bulb, those two things couldn't possibly be related)
[13:02] <KM0201> gac: but my point is, you insinuated it is their "responsibility" (ie, legally) to fix, it is not.. trust me
[13:02] <Emanon> Not the rom FROM cwm. CWM itself.
[13:03] <gac> I said "I hold the garage responsible", I believe, not that it was without doubt their responsibility
[13:03] <Eagleman> Do i need a specific order when installing these packets?  apt-get install mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-mcrypt php5-gd php5-intl apache2 libapache2-mod-php5
[13:03] <KM0201> gac: ah ok, i might have misread that....
[13:05] <Emanon> Looks like there is no twrp for that device.

[13:12] <qwery> hey guys
[13:13] <qwery> i want to set up a http server locally and stream all my audio output to it, so i can listen to it with my network hifi device
[13:13] <qwery> read some blog articles about doing that with vlc, for example, but it didnt quite work..
[13:13] <KM0201> hm
[13:13] <qwery> any ideas how that can be done "easily"?
[13:14] <KM0201> would a daap server work?
[13:14] <moin> nick moin''
[13:14] <Emanon> qwery: http://www.subsonic.org/pages/index.jsp ?
[13:14] <moin> \nick moin''
[13:14] <qwery> seems tht ffmpeg has some streaming capabilities, but it always looks like it streams to an existing server in the network or something, wondering how that works
[13:14] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: First, why an http server?  Second, do you want to stream TO the server or FROM the server?
[13:14] <KM0201> oh damnn, subsonic, that should work fine
=== moin is now known as moin``
=== moin`` is now known as ssh_help
=== ssh_help is now known as `ssh`help
[13:16] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: Do you want an audio stream programmed at the server, or do you want your music collection to be available from other devices?
[13:16] <qwery> KM0201: i think daap (and also dlna) would only work for files. but i also want to stream other audio output, like sound from a internet radio website or such
[13:16] <KM0201> qwery: yup, you're right,
[13:16] <Emanon> If you donate you get a subsonic url so you don't have to worry about making a static ip or forwarding ports (iirc) and you can stream audio AND video.
[13:16] <KM0201> subsonic is probably the best bet,
[13:16] <qwery> jhutchins_wk: not only the music collection, but all audio output. thats what makes a http server necessary i guess
[13:17] <KM0201> although i don't know about audio from a website, etc
[13:17] <qwery> how does subsonic work?
[13:17] <`ssh`help> hi, how does one setup ssh for a public IP? I have it working within my LAN but no luck with public IPs.
[13:17] <Emanon> qwery: sets up a local server that streams your whole media library via apps or an html interface.
[13:17] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: http has nothing to do with audio.

[13:18] <jhutchins_wk> `ssh`help: The device with a public ip has to have the ssh server listening on that interface.
[13:18] <qwery> Emanon: wouldnt that also only stream the files?
[13:18] <Boreeas_> It worked fine before, but since the last reinstall, I'm having trouble
[13:18] <gac> `ssh`help: all you need to do is forward port 22 on your router (using the router admin tools) to the LAN IP address of the machine running sshd
[13:19] <KM0201> yeah, i think it's port 21 or 22
[13:19] <jhutchins_wk> `ssh`help: Most of us are behind NAT firewalls, so we forward a port on the firewall to the internal ssh connection.
[13:19] <qwery> jhutchins_wk: yeah, but i can get my hifi to read an http stream and play it
[13:19] <Boreeas_> I think related to that is that suspend/resume fails, too, but I can't find any logs for that
[13:19] <Eagleman> Do i need a specific order when installing these packets?  apt-get install mysql-server php5 php5-mysql php5-mcrypt php5-gd php5-intl apache2 libapache2-mod-php5
[13:19] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: No, you can't, because there is no http stream.  http is web pages, that's all.
[13:19] <Boreeas_> Eagleman: No, the order doesn't matter
[13:19] <KM0201> no, just install them all at the same time.
[13:19] <gac> Eagleman: I don't think so, apt should take care of installing them in the right order to satisfy any dependencies
[13:19] <Boreeas_> Dependencies will be installed automatically, too
[13:19] <qwery> jhutchins_wk: so if i could manage to have my computers audio in such a stream, it would work
[13:19] <WeThePeople> dr_willis, are you able to change a guest session into a root session?
[13:19] <WeThePeople> so i can access home
[13:20] <qwery> jhutchins_wk: http is a transfer protocol for files, not only html
[13:20] <gac> WeThePeople: probably not, as I guess the guest user isn't in the admin/sudo group by default
[13:20] <Eagleman> and what if i install php first then apache and mysql or any other random order?
[13:20] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: I think gstreamer will host an audio stream, as will vlc.
[13:20] <gac> Eagleman: shouldn't make any difference
[13:20] <Eagleman> not in the same command i mean
[13:20] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: Right, files, not streams.
[13:20] <Eagleman> seperate
[13:20] <gac> still shouldn't matter
[13:20] <Eagleman> ok, ty
[13:20] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: Pages, not audio.
[13:21] <`ssh`help> gac: ok, I a using my modem connection. how do i do that?
[13:21] <qwery> jhutchins_wk: well, but that doesnt really matter for that application, right? it is just that i confused the terms, isnt it?
[13:21] <jhutchins_wk> qwery: You can use a web page to initiate a stream over another transport, but it's not over http.
[13:21] <gac> `ssh`help: as in a dialup connection?
[13:22] <`ssh`help> jhutchins_wk: Both computers have the open-ssh-server installed,
[13:22] <`ssh`help> gac: yea
[13:22] <KM0201> lol
[13:22] <qwery> jhutchins_wk: ah, i see.
[13:22] <`ssh`help> gac: kindly help bro,
[13:22] <qwery> jhutchins_wk: how would it work with gstreamer/vlc?
[13:22] <gac> `ssh`help: honestly, I have no idea, I haven't used a dialup in over 10 years
[13:22] <jhutchins_wk> `ssh`help: What are you actually trying to do?  What commands have you tried?
[13:23] <gac> `ssh`help: but I think once you have the dialup connection established, you may need to restart the ssh server so that it can bind to the dialup IP (because it wouldn't have existed when ssh was started)
[13:23] <sazawal> I need to install ubuntu from network. Please help!
[13:23] <gac> and with a dialup connection, you probably don't have NAT in the way so that should be enough (I think)
[13:24] <jhutchins_wk> sazawal: Have you read the install guide?
[13:24] <sazawal> I have followed the instructions given here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/QuickNetboot

[13:24] <sazawal> I guess this is the install guide
[13:24] <WeThePeople> anybody know how to gain root access in a guest session?
[13:25] <qwery> for the second, the file was accessible with my smartphone, but it said "cannot play video/audio" or smth

[13:36] <Guest84357> Are there any known fixes? I found some people with similar issues, but no real answers.
[13:37] <KM0201> i found 12.10 really buggy, so i chose to stay w/ 12.04

[13:44] <zetheroo> I installed 12.10 on a Windows 7 workstation but for some reason GRUB does not show on system startup and the system boots right into Windows 7 still
[13:44] <magik_> SpaceA, you might wanna post that bug on the forum cause it could cause some speaker problems.
[13:44] <zetheroo> can I install GRUB from the live CD?
[13:44] <sazawal> I need to install ubuntu from networkboot. Help!!
[13:44] <nibbler__> SpaceA, a workaround might be to write a script that sets volume to zero early during shutdown....
[13:45] <SpaceA> nibbler__, I tried muting before shutdown but that doesnt work :/
[13:45] <SpaceA> any other way to try it?
[13:45] <KM0201> nibbler__: but then won't volume be 0 when he restarts?
[13:45] <magik_> zetheroo, this video helped me allot http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W7XYAB4cLc
[13:46] <nibbler__> KM0201, that would call for a startup script then - but its not working anyway
[13:46] <SpaceA> KM0201, i dont mind it being zero at boot

[14:00] <wuq> no, i dont knwo what that is. so i dont think i am using it
[14:00] <magik_> greenbrother, openssh is a remote access tool
[14:01] <greenbrother> how can i that try?
[14:01] <arshavin> mikew68: there must be loads of imformation about that on google
[14:01] <suku> wuq, from the thread i was looking at, is the network card in bohdi configured for dhcp or are you assigning it a static ip?
[14:02] <wuq> it is set to autoatic dhcp
[14:02] <mikew68> arshavin, you are correct and I've looked unfortunatly I've had very little success, so I figure maybe someone has seen/experienced my issues.
[14:02] <magik_> greenbrother, here is a link with help on openssh https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/openssh-server.html
[14:02] <wuq> i think, let me check that
[14:02] <greenbrother> 10x
[14:03] <arshavin> mikew68: what device do you wish to set up as server?
[14:03] <layke_> Not sure what channel to ask. Is there something like tail -f but that flashes through coloring new additions to the pipe?
[14:03] <magik_> greenbrother, if you just wanted to setup a simpler file server then you could use vsftpd
[14:03] <MonkeyDust> layke_  #bash
[14:03] <layke_> Thanks MonkeyDust  :)
[14:03] <wuq> yeah magik_ it is set to auto dhcp. it is frustratign because i bet it is some really simple issue. I am slightly newb with linux
[14:03] <greenbrother> no
[14:03] <greenbrother> i don't want server
[14:03] <magik_> greenbrother, and you could access that vsftpd through any http webbrowser.

[14:04] <ichat> blami,  - sorry was afk for a bit,   thnx for the heads up ... i really should try it i gues..   win8 toshiba is supposed to be  full efi.   so not having legacy in my loader would be perfect i guess
[14:04] <greenbrother> but it have some bug
[14:04] <wuq> i actually tried a few other distros and had similar problems when i used my router
[14:04] <greenbrother> this is only on 12.10
[14:05] <wuq> but router works fine on my other computer that runs Win7
[14:05] <layke_> Pici, It's not in the feature list. so I don't think so. Thanks for the pointer though.
[14:05] <magik_> greenbrother, your best bet is to post a bug on the ubuntu forums there are allot of people there that are very smart and will answer your question in more detail.
[14:05] <suku> wuq, has that computer ever worked with that router?
[14:05] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: The OS has nothing to do with how a system works with a router, that's strictly TCP/IP.
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest70986
[14:05] <suku> or any router for that matter?
[14:06] <greenbrother> many peaple have that maked, but i can't fint fix
[14:06] <wuq> i belive it did, before it was running windows millinum and i recall it working.
[14:06] <mikew68> arshavin I'd like to run a media server in 12.10, and stream through DLNA to my blu-ray. I've tried XBMC, it connects but does not play .AVI files, so I set up PLEX, it plays the .AVI files but doesn't play .mp4
[14:07] <arshavin> mikew68: http://dpc.ucore.info/blog/2012/11/07/dlna-streaming-in-ubuntu-12-dot-10/
[14:07] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: So what is the problem?  Can you not reach external addresses?
[14:07] <magik_> greenbrother, it might be the access settings you have on the folder your trying to browse.
[14:07] <suku> wuq, since you are able to get the computer to work when bypassing the router, i would assume it is a router issue and not an os issue
[14:08] <wuq> hm, i see, i kind f thought it was an issue to do with the way i did the settings
[14:08] <greenbrother> i have maked all settings and it should work, but...
[14:08] <greenbrother> i haven't luck
[14:08] <suku> wuq, just so i make sure i read your post correctly, you have tried plugging the system into the router over an ethernet cable and it doesnt work either?
[14:08] <wuq> why would the router not recognize the OS, for example?
[14:09] <wuq> yes
[14:09] <ichat> Wug,  the router doesn know the os
[14:09] <wuq> and thank you for looking at the post suku
[14:09] <suku> wuq, the router and os are independent of each other... a router doesnt detect os's
[14:10] <suku> they communicate over the tcp/ip stack
[14:10] <wuq> so are saying that it may be having trouble detecting my network card/
[14:10] <ichat> wuq. correct
[14:10] <suku> and since you are able to connect when you take the router out of the picture, it tells me that it is likely a router or network card issue
[14:11] <ichat> that could be a media error (sorry: a cable fault),   or some other technical issue
[14:11] <magik_> wuq, you could always try to hard boot your router see if that works.
[14:11] <wuq> my computer is very old, almost 11 years-ish. is this a common issue I wonder - old network cards not work with new routers
[14:12] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: No.
[14:12] <wuq> magik_ could you explain hard boot
[14:12] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: If the cables fit they should work.
[14:12] <magik_> wuq, when i say hard boot, I mean follow the instructions on doing a reset of the router usualy involves sticking a paperclip in a little hole it resets all the router settings to factory default.
[14:12] <magik_> wuq, I've had to do that with routers in the past.
[14:12] <suku> wuq, he means either pulling the plug on the router and letting it sit for 2 mins, or even more of a hard boot would be completely resetting the factory settings on the router
[14:13] <wuq> ah, yeah I have done that before but I have not tried it for this problem yet.
[14:13] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: If you do what magik_ suggests you will probably loose all ability to connect to the internet from any of your systems.
[14:13] <ichat> magik what about  a data problem   in example  100mbit versus 10mbit   or even full duplex versus half duplex
[14:13] <wuq> why you say that jhutchins?
[14:13] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: You need to do basic network troubleshooting before you start messing with the router.
[14:14] <wuq> hm, for example?
[14:14] <ichat> magik  i would explain it to him, but i have no knowledge about  hoe to detect sutch under a linux os
[14:14] <rom> hi, guys.
[14:15] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: Can you state the actual problem again please?  You can't connect to external web sites or what?
[14:15] <magik_> wuq, one question i should of asked is this is a wireless router or just a ethernet cable?
[14:15] <wuq> it is outlined here http://forums.bodhilinux.com/index.php?/topic/7392-unable-to-connect-to-internet-through-my-router/
[14:15] <suku> wuq, and if you need specific answers specific to bodhi, you can also check out #bodhilinux
[14:15] <ichat> jhutchins_wk,   agreed  but only to the extend that a hard reboot  of the router defualts to dhcp in almost all cases   so he would   be able to connect for support as soon as the device has reset....
[14:15] <wuq> thanks suku, yes i have tried there but no luck so far
[14:16] <rom> what happens when i reinstall ubuntu with a live cd, only the main partition gets formatted or all the partitions get formatted?
[14:16] <wuq> magik_ the router has wireless capabilities but i am using an ethernet cable
[14:16] <Squarepy> rom, that is your choice
[14:17] <magik_> wuq, hmmm ok, I think that might be a network card problem so it might not be the router at all.
[14:17] <suku> wuq, if it is any consolation, i am running bodhi on my netbook... great distro for lightweight machines - i honestly think it is a networking issue somewhere between the router and network config
[14:17] <jhutchins_wk> ichat: He would loose any local lan configuration.
[14:17] <ichat> jhutchins_wk,  only for a small bit
[14:17] <rom> so if i dont want to format other partitions, i dont have to, is that so?
[14:18] <wuq> yeah, it runs amazing on my old laptop. i dont remember it ever working so smooth. i only have a small graphic issue and this connectivity issue
[14:18] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: When you connect directly to the external network, there is a remote DHCP server that provides your system with an address and routing info.  You must recreate that on the local network either using the router or a local server.
[14:18] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: Most routers have a dhcp server built in these days.
[14:18] <ichat> jhutchins_wk,  - there are no consumer grade modem routers out there that do not default do simple dhcp + nat
[14:18] <rom> even if it is previously made partitions?
[14:18] <jhutchins_wk> ichat: Sure there are.
[14:19] <donvito> VERSION=`cat /etc/slackware-version` - how can i do this command to show ubuntu version ?
[14:19] <ichat> jhutchins_wk,  name me one
[14:19] <magik_> rom I would advise you backed up any data before proceeding with any format
[14:20] <piglit> i have got a ip-camera and i can use it from 2 pc's but the ubuntu pc wont work
[14:20] <wuq> ok, so what kind of network troubleshooting are you guys suggesting
[14:20] <piglit> dont know where to start
[14:20] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: Here is the manual for your router: https://www2.belkin.com/support/article/?lid=en&pid=f5d8236-4&aid=14394&scid=942&fid=4812&fn=man_f5d8236-4_8820-00097.pdf
[14:20] <magik_> wuq, start with the network card since your notconnecting wirelessly
[14:20] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: You need to know if the PC is getting an address from the router.
[14:20] <rom> it is too hard for me to do that, because it takes too much time and have a lot to. and it is hard with all this power cuts in my place..

[14:22] <magik_> dawkirst, those are probably gedit backup files it has a setting to save files before a save so you still have the old version to go back to.

[14:23] <suku> usr13, wouldnt that be he own ip?
[14:23] <wuq> how do i ping that?
[14:23] <suku> his*
[14:23] <rom> i have done a backup for the ubuntu main desk, do i have to do it for all the other?
[14:24] <usr13> wuq: Sorry, 10.24.8.1 is YOUR IP.
[14:24] <wuq> ah! lol
[14:24] <magik_> rom, Yes because if something goes wrong you'll run into trouble getting that data back unless your good at recovering files.
[14:24] <usr13> wuq: ping -c3 10.24.8.1
[14:24] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: Now use the route command to see if there is a default gateway.
[14:24] <veleno> for instance, I found this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCDCustomization but it looks pretty lengthy
[14:24] <wuq> as in type "route" into terminal?
[14:24] <usr13> wuq: route -n
[14:24] <magik_> yeah
[14:25] <nickalex> enzotib offende chi non e capace e non so come fare elp
[14:25] <usr13> wuq: (See what your gateway is) Should be 10.24.8.1
[14:25] <karmic-koala> hi all, anyone got any suggestions on what address would be sensible for a staging server? currently we have  cms-staging.universityname.ac.uk which isnt ideal. I am thinking cms-auth.universityname.ac.uk ...?
[14:25] <rom> <magik_> thanks, il try following that!
[14:25] <MonkeyDust> nickalex  is that some italian dialect?
[14:25] <wuq> no, it doesnt give me that
[14:25] <usr13> wuq: What does it give?
[14:26] <nickalex> mia butato fuori
[14:26] <suku> wuq, what does is say is the default route for gateway
[14:26] <wuq> just says "gateway genmask flags metric ref use iface
[14:26] <magik_> rom, np
[14:26] <suku> nothing underneath?
[14:26] <usr13> wuq: Try this:  dhclient
[14:26] <wuq> keep in mind that i did ifconfig when i wasnt using my router
=== linuxthefish` is now known as linuxthefish
=== fisted_ is now known as fisted
[14:26] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: There's your problem.
[14:26] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: ifconfig just displays the settings.
[14:26] <usr13> wuq: Is this a wireless connection?  Or wired?
[14:27] <wuq> wired
[14:27] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: If you want this to work with the router you should be connected with the router.
[14:27] <wuq> i am now
[14:27] <wuq> i was giving you info from before
[14:27] <suku> once connected do a "route -n"
[14:27] <usr13> wuq: dhclient eth0
[14:27] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: Plug in to the router and do /etc/init.d/networking restart
[14:27] <magik_> usr13, he's using a wired connection
[14:27] <jhutchins_wk> usr13: Quit jumping ahead.
[14:28] <wuq> usr13 im told operation not permited
[14:28] <usr13> sudo dhclient eth0
[14:28] <dawkirst> Squarepy, magik_, you guys got it. Thanks.
[14:28] <ichat> usr13,  -  network reset comes first.
[14:28] <usr13> suku: And then ifconfig  (and see what IP you got)
[14:28] <wuq> ok, did that Jhutch
[14:28] <magik_> dawkirst, your welcome ;)
[14:29] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: Do ifconfig again and see if you still have the same address, then do route again to see if you have a gateway.
[14:30] <wuq> ok i belive this is my address now. 127.0.0.1
[14:30] <MonkeyDust> that's localhost, your pc
[14:30] <suku> nope that is the localhost address
[14:30] <usr13> wuq: No, that is loopback
[14:30] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: That is for the lo (loopback) interface.
[14:31] <KM0201> usually its 192.168.x.x
[14:31] <usr13> wuq: Did you do  sudo dhclient eth0 ?
[14:31] <wuq> ok, then....im not getting one
[14:31] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: If you do not see something like eth0 then you don't have a working connection.  Are the port lights lit on the PC and the router?
[14:31] <wuq> i see eth0 but no ip there
[14:32] <wuq> the green one is lit
[14:32] <usr13> wuq: Are you sure the cable is ok?
[14:32] <jhutchins_wk> usr13: Ok, I'm gonna have to let you try to stumble through this.  It's clear that you barely have a clue about networking, but you insist on "helping".  It's all yours.
[14:32] <mikew68> arshavin; thanks! that seems to work
[14:32] <wuq> i think so, i have tried more than one cable
[14:32] <jhutchins_wk> wuq: I'll come back later and see if an experienced network engineer can still help you.
[14:32] <wuq> aw : - /
[14:32] <usr13> jhutchins_wk: Just trying to help.  It's easier if you just cut to the chase.
[14:32] <wuq> stay, i will follow you
[14:33] <wuq> oh well, what your ideas usr13
[14:33] <magik_> lol
[14:33] <usr13> wuq: Sorry about jhuchins_wk  I think he just got up on the wrong side of the bed.
[14:33] <wuq> lol, was confusing trying to follow everyone
[14:33] <suku> sounds like either the dhcp server isnt handing out an ip or you dont have the network card set to auto/dhcp
[14:33] <usr13> wuq: Did you do   sudo  dhclient eth0
[14:33] <usr13> ?
[14:34] <MonkeyDust> or sudo ifup
[14:34] <wuq> how would i set the network card? yes i did that and client was not found
[14:34] <usr13> wuq: dhclient not client     sudo dhclient eth0
[14:35] <wuq> oops, made spelling error
[14:35] <wuq> strange, when i typed that the cursor just blinks
[14:35] <wuq> what should it do?
[14:35] <usr13> wuq: It's waiting for an IP
[14:36] <usr13> wuq: It will time out.
[14:36] <usr13> ... if it doesnt' get an IP.
[14:36] <usr13> wuq: Did it time out yet?
[14:36] <wuq> no, shall i restart terminal?
[14:36] <usr13> no.  just open another.
[14:37] <wuq> ok
[14:37] <usr13> Shift-Ctrl-n
[14:37] <ichat> wuq,  what is going on on your other (now connected pc)
[14:38] <usr13> It sounds like the router does not have the DHCP server turned on.  So, do you know anything about your router?  What kind of router is it?
[14:38] <wuq> its what i am chatting on right now. it works fine, no problems
[14:38] <suku> i am curious of the other pc is receiving an ip via dhcp
[14:38] <suku> if*
[14:38] <ichat> Wuq is it on the same network?
[14:38] <usr13> wuq: Do you have a brand name?  or....?
[14:38] <ichat> suku me 2
[14:38] <wuq> the router is Belkin F5D8236-4 v3 4-Port Built-in Switch Wireless N Route
[14:38] <frooh> hey guys, I'm trying to build fitbitd (git clone http://paulburton.eu/git/fitbitd.git) and it's not finding dbus/dbus.h, I have libdbus-1-dev installed (found here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=contents&keywords=dbus.h&mode=exactfilename&suite=quantal&arch=any)
[14:38] <frooh> is there something obvious I'm missing
[14:39] <ichat> usr13  it was mention earlier
[14:39] <wuq> i can get into the settings area but i am not very knowledgable about how to manipluate them
[14:39] <usr13> wuq: And you have connected to a LAN port on it.  Right?
[14:39] <wuq> yeah
[14:39] <ichat> wuq you mean from the router or your working pc?\
[14:39] <wuq> from my working pc i can manipluate the router
[14:40] <usr13> wuq: Are the other PCs getting IP addresses in the range of 192.168.1.x  or 192.168.2.x  or?
[14:40] <magik_> wuq, login to the router using the http://xxx.xxx.xx.xx and check the settings
[14:40] <jabba_> anyone familiar with the usage of pciback and pcifront in newer ubuntu releases like 12.04?
[14:40] <ichat> BTW verry important wuq dont ever  change anything and most certianly dont hit  save or   apply  ....
[14:40] <usr13> wuq: What IP do you use to loginto it?  192.168.1.1 ?
[14:40] <wuq> but when i see the settings, my linux installed pc does nto show up
[14:40] <wuq> ok logging in]
[14:41] <usr13> wuq: What is the IP address of your router?  Is it 192.168.1.1 ?
[14:41] <suku> wuq, here is a way we can make sure your router is setup for dhcp.... you said the computer you are on is windows, right? open a command prompt and type "ipconfig /all". go to the network card that has the connection and let me know what it says next to DHCP server
[14:41] <wuq>  	192.168.2.1
[14:41] <usr13> wuq: Ok, on our Ubuntu PC type this:  sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.91
[14:42] <usr13> wuq: Now this:  ping -c3 192.168.2.1
[14:42] <magik_> wuq, so 192.168.2.1 is for the router and your working computer is 192.168.2.2 or 3 or 4 right?
[14:43] <wuq> ping is unreachable
[14:43] <usr13> wuq: ifconfig    Tell us what IP it has.
[14:44] <usr13> wuq: verify that it actually has  192.168.2.91  as it's IP.
[14:44] <magik_> usr13, I think he said it was 192.168.2.1
[14:44] <suku> usr13, if we just change his ip to the same subnet, we will still need to setup the routes... wouldnt it be easier to find out if his router is even running dhcp so he can bypass having to do that?
[14:44] <usr13> magik_: No he didn't
[14:44] <wuq> yes, i belive that is right magik_ --- also suku DHCP is enabled
[14:45] <suku> Wug, what is the dhcp server ip address?
[14:45] <wuq> i mean, regarding my ips addresses
[14:45] <magik_> wuq, ok now open a browser on the working computer and type http://192.168.2.1
[14:45] <ichat> suku,  - do you know how to set media to 10mbit  non auto negotiate  half duplex on  linux
[14:45] <usr13> suku: the dhcp server's IP is 192.168.2.1
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[14:46] <wuq> yes, i am already there magik
[14:46] <usr13> suku: But he either has a bad cable or is plugged into a dead port.
[14:46] <suku> usr13, assuming the dhcp server on the router is running
[14:46] <magik_> ok what does it say for dhcp server?
[14:46] <usr13> suku: I was trying to determine that.
[14:46] <magik_> should be somewhere in the settings.
[14:46] <wuq> enabled
[14:46] <usr13> wuq: You need to try another cable.
[14:46] <suku> thats why i had him check on his windows box where it gives the address of the dhcp server - that would confirm if the dhcp server is running
[14:47] <magik_> Try a different ethernet cable if that does not work you need a new network card.
[14:47] <usr13> wuq: What does it say the dhcp pool is?  192.168.2.1 -  192.168.2.100 ?
[14:47] <wuq> but this cable works fine when i plug directly into the wall
[14:47] <usr13> wuq: "into the wall"?
[14:47] <suku> wuq, have you also tried using a different port on the router, or even better, have you tried using the exact port that your windows computer is on?
[14:47] <magik_> usr13, he meant the cable modem itself
[14:47] <wuq> as in, without using the router i can connect with no problem
[14:47] <usr13> Oh
[14:48] <wuq> yes, tried vall ports
[14:48] <wuq> the DHCP pool is 2-100
[14:48] <usr13> sorry I don't know what a vall poort is.
[14:48] <wuq> i meant, tried all ports
[14:48] <magik_> ok wuq if you know how to do a hard reset try that if that don't work then you should get a new network card or a wireless adapter and connect that way.
[14:48] <wuq> sorry, i have a sticky keyboard. it sucks, i spilled tea all over y good one
[14:49] <ichat> magic hang on
[14:49] <suku> you sure you didnt spill it on the router or network card too?
[14:49] <wuq> ok, i might hold off on hard reset because i need to find my router info.
[14:49] <suku> ;-)
[14:49] <usr13> wuq: Yea, you might try restarting the router.
[14:49] <wuq> lol!!! suku
[14:49] <wuq> no, it was on an external keyboard
[14:49] <usr13> wuq: unplug the power cord  for a couple seconds.
[14:49] <suku> usr13, he already tried that
[14:50] <wuq> to the router? i have tried that but i can try again
[14:50] <wuq> iver tried a few times though
[14:50] <magik_> It's gotta be the eth0 adapter giving the problems.
[14:50] <wuq> tell me this - if network card works fine without router, then it cant be a problem with network card right?
[14:50] <usr13> wuq: It may be that your network interface is defective.
[14:50] <magik_> the network card installed on the pc
[14:50] <suku> wuq, the only thing i think is a last resort would be to do a factory reset on the router - if that doesnt work then it is possible it is a bad nic
[14:51] <wuq> aw : - /
[14:51] <usr13> I say it's a bad NIC
[14:51] <wuq> not really worth investing in the pc, its so old....
[14:51] <ichat> wuq a last  time to did confirm your pc workin correctly on the wall  right?
[14:51] <magik_> I say it probably needs a factory reset
[14:51] <usr13> wuq: Do you have another NIC you can stick in it?
[14:51] <wuq> yes, it definitely works when plugged into wall
[14:51] <suku> try the factory reset on the router first
[14:52] <wuq> no usr13
[14:52] <usr13> wuq: Oh wait.  It works when you bypass the router?
[14:52] <wuq> yes
[14:52] <iceroot> wuq: i had a case where i was using a nic which was set to 1gbit/s and no other modes and the router (switch inside the router, could only handle 100mbit/s) that caused a defunctional network for me
[14:52] <usr13> forgot that.  Very strange.
[14:52] <wuq> works easy withotu router but i need router for my other pc
[14:52] <wuq> otherwise i woudl just plug into wall
[14:52] <usr13> wuq: Did you try  sudo ifconfig eth0 192.168.2.91;ping -c3 192.168.2.1
[14:52] <usr13> ?
[14:53] <wuq> yes, tried that
[14:53] <wuq> let me try again though to be sure, maybe spellign error
[14:53] <usr13> Yea, try again.
[14:53] <ichat> iceroot,  - thats exactly what im thinkin about... BUT  how the ef do you set this on linux
[14:53] <iceroot> wuq: that command will not work because no subnet is set, you have to use 192.168.2.91/24 or set the network too with a subnet command
[14:54] <iceroot> ichat: it was set in the bios, some strange propritary stuff
[14:54] <wuq> i dont really understand what your saying iceroot. can you spell out the steps i need to take to figure out what your saying and if it applies
[14:54] <usr13> iceroot: It works.  YOu don't need to set netmask
[14:55] <iceroot> usr13: and how does the system knows which netmask?
[14:55] <Guest30424> Hey
[14:55] <ichat> iceroot - agreed but for example in windows you can set  auto negotiate... and full or half duplex including  its raete
[14:55] <magik_> Well sorry I couldn't help you wuq I've had problems with router's usualy a hard reset did the fix for me.
[14:55] <ichat> however i do not know how to do this on a linux host

[14:57] <wuq> i tried the ifconfig stuff again but just get unreachable

[14:57] <magik_> ichat, you'll get used to it and never want to use Windows again besideds for games and for shits and giggles.
[14:57] <wuq> thanks for the try guys. I think i will take a break with this and try a hard reset later.

[15:00] <AyushD> anyone know how will ubuntu will work on Android Tab ?
[15:00] <frooh> iceroot: sorry, I'm being unclear, I'm logged in from the terminal first and it's saying I can't log in from X
[15:00] <frooh> presumably because the ternminal (tmux) was spawned from a now dead x server
[15:01] <magik_> AyushD, I wouldn't recommend it because you will probably won't beable to get a GUI

[15:03] <Robbilie> AyushD, on some devices replacing is possible
[15:04] <iceroot> LambdaMutt_: alt + left-click, hold the mouse after that and move it with the mouse

[15:08] <larstk> hi all
[15:09] <ichat> LambdaMutt_,  - in other words  they advice you updating to  12.04 for a long term release or  12.10 for the latest and hotest
[15:10] <KM0201> the easiest thing to do (if you like gnome 2.x) would be to install ubuntu 12.04, then install mate desktop
[15:10] <KM0201> thats as close as you'll get to gnome 2.

[15:34] <tjingboem> i want to add a program to the pythonpath. Is this correct?? export PYTHONPATH=/home/menno/bin/athenaCL/athenaCL

[15:34] <imbezol> is there a way to make ls list files in the same order as other distros?
[15:34] <ActionParsnip> Tjingboem: i'd put it in ~/.bashrc
[15:35] <ichat> ActionParsnip,  is there a  list command   that doesnt  state the obvious about not being for fillsharing :P
[15:35] <imbezol> ie, folders first?
[15:35] <auronandace> ichat: list of what?
[15:35] <tjingboem> ActionParsnip, thanks, will try
[15:35] <ActionParsnip> IChat: well, this isn't a filesharing network,  so what else can she say?
[15:36] <ActionParsnip> Tjingboem: obviously,  you will need to source the file for it to be reread

[15:37] <ichat> ah now thats  usefull :P - thanks

[15:37] <Cantide> <Cantide> just put a new m/b + cpu + ram in

[15:37] <Cantide> <Cantide> how do i update my drivers? 'o'
[15:38] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: why do you need to update the drivers?
[15:39] <Cantide> Unity is running in Unity 2D
[15:39] <Cantide> and it's ugly :p
[15:39] <Cantide> i'm running 12.04 btw
[15:39] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: were you using onboard video before?
[15:39] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: ehat
=== adrien_ is now known as Guest32263
[15:39] <Cantide> no, i had an old nvidia card in here
[15:39] <Cantide> but i won't bother putting it in this board
[15:40] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: what video chip are you using now?
[15:40] <Cantide> onboard..
[15:40] <Cantide> H61.. so..
[15:40] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: what is the output of: lspci | grep -I vga
[15:41] <Cantide> nothing 'o'
[15:41] <Cantide> it outputs nothing -.-v
[15:41] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: try: sudo lshw -C display    what is the product line for the video chip (s)
[15:42] <Cantide> Ivy Bridge
[15:42] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: and no nvidia mentioned?
[15:43] <Cantide> It's Intel
[15:43] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: good :-)
[15:43] <Cantide> Vendor: Intel Corporation
[15:43] <jhutchins_wk> Cantide: lspci | grep -i vga
[15:43] <jhutchins_wk> ActionParsnip: Upper case is "process binaries".
[15:44] <Cantide> oh, lower case i shows this:
[15:44] <Cantide> 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Ivy Bridge Graphics Controller (rev 09)
[15:44] <auronandace> Cantide: ivy bridge is rather new
[15:44] <Cantide> auronandace, yeah.. but not _that_ new
[15:44] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1995945
[15:45] <auronandace> Cantide: i'm not sure how much support for it is in 12.04
[15:45] <lacrymology> I'm trying to set up the nvidia drivers, I followed this http://www.techlw.com/2012/03/install-nvidia-drivers-on-ubuntu-1204.html and running the nvidia xserver settings says "you're not using nvidia", I run nvidia-xconfig and it had to CREATE /etc/X11/xorg.conf  (so I gather ubuntu uses a different config file) and running the "additional drivers" application finds no propietary drivers in the system. Can someone lend me a hand?
[15:45] <Cantide> ActionParsnip, thanks. But I have H61, not Z77
[15:45] <ActionParsnip> Jhutchins_wk: I just use what I know works :-)
[15:45] <jhutchins_wk> Cantide: What I would guess is that you have the nvidia configuration still in place and that's preventing the proper intel driver from loading.  Try moving/renaming /etc/X11/xorg.conf
[15:46] <Cantide> thanks, i will give it a shot
[15:46] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: seems you need Quantal for support
[15:46] <ActionParsnip> Jhutchins_wk: good point
[15:47] <ares_> I can't do anything with desktop!
[15:47] <Cantide> okay, so now i need to reboot i guess?
[15:47] <ActionParsnip> Ares_: can you give more details....
[15:47] <lotharn> is there a way to get unity to only display icons  for windows on it's respective screen ?
[15:48] <lotharn> in the taskbar
[15:48] <lotharn> in a multimon system
[15:49] <ares_> OOOOOooooo ActionParsnip Mr. cool dude! I can't select any icons on desktop all icons are invisible i can't see them and  i can't click mouse2 on desktop :[
[15:50] <lacrymology> can someone give me a hand with my nvidia drivers, please?
[15:50] <Cantide> hmm, still no luck..
[15:50] <DaemonicApathy> ares_: did you use gnome-tweak-tool or anything to stop the file manager from handling the desktop?
[15:51] <Roubles> I am installing ubuntu from mini.iso, and I am now facing a software selection menu like this: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Nu44s.jpg
[15:51] <ares_> i tried to install it
[15:51] <ares_> but i don't have it
[15:51] <Roubles> I did this install before and selected ubuntu desktop, but when I restarted I found I had no desktop manager...
[15:52] <Roubles> What should I select here if I want a desktop environment?
[15:52] <DaemonicApathy> Roubles: anything that says "desktop" or "full" should work.

[15:53] <exdev-2012> is it possible to speak to a channel op?
[15:53] <Roubles> DaemonicApathy: thanks.
[15:53] <ActionParsnip> Ares_: if you press Alt+F2 can you run nautilus ?
[15:53] <MonkeyDust> sazawal  read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation#Server_and_network_installations
[15:53] <ares_> Yes
[15:54] <exdev-2012> ares_: that would be you?
[15:54] <ActionParsnip> Roubles: scroll down, you'll see the Ubuntu desktop option
[15:54] <ares_> exdev nope
[15:55] <ActionParsnip> Ares_: nautilus draws the desktop icons
[15:55] <exdev-2012> okay - how would I go about doing that?
[15:56] <DaemonicApathy> ares_:Assuming you use compiz for wallpapers, nautilus will not put icons on the desktop, nor will right click work. If you are not using compiz wallpapers, you should be able to use gconf-editor to make sure /apps/nautilus/preferences/show_desktop is enabled.

[16:01] <sazawal> Mongolski`, I have followed the steps here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/QuickNetboot . Will it help?
[16:01] <Cantide> that link i posted worked for H61 :)
[16:01] <ActionParsnip> Cantide: I find 2D faster. 3D isn't worth it imho
[16:01] <jhutchins_wk> Cantide: you usually don't need to reboot, just restart X.
[16:01] <Mongolski`> sazawal why you asked me?
[16:02] <ares_> who could help me through teamviewer
[16:02] <ares_> ? :(
[16:02] <jhutchins_wk> But ActionParsnip, JIGGLY WINDOWS!

[16:02] <ActionParsnip> Jhutchins_wk: omg like titally worth it </sarcasm>
[16:02] <Mongolski`> :)
[16:03] <sazawal> MonkeyDust, I have followed the steps here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/QuickNetboot . Will it help?
[16:03] <ActionParsnip> Ares_: if you run s terminal and run: lsb_release -sc     what is output?
[16:03] <MonkeyDust> sazawal  the tutorials are reliable, so give it a try
[16:04] <ares_> output: precise
[16:04] <Cantide> ActionParsnip, those giant icons in the launcher scared me away from 2D, that's about it
[16:04] <Cantide> jhutchins_wk, I didn't think of restarting x... oops :)
[16:04] <Cantide> anyway, reboot is quick :)
[16:05] <sazawal> MonkeyDust, The problem is that, QuickNetboot tutorial doesnt talk about where to mount the iso file

[16:10] <ActionParsnip> Shpngld: how did you install them?
[16:11] <shpngld> ActionParsnip, well from ubuntu CD, WifI MANUALLY
[16:11] <invariant> ActionParsnip, it means: "does any Ubuntu application not work with a Vanilla kernel".
[16:11] <ActionParsnip> D_max: is it the same as a new ubuntu user?
[16:11] <jhutchins_wk> shpngld: Don't worry about the drivers, you can do a clean install.
[16:11] <ActionParsnip> Shpngld: do you use a cheap broadcom wifi?
[16:12] <ActionParsnip> Invariant: yes they all do.
[16:12] <shpngld> ActionParsnip,  yes i think so b43..its very hard to me to install it
[16:12] <shpngld> ActionParsnip,  I did it but i dont even remember how...Iam keeping the package
[16:13] <ActionParsnip> Shpngld: the packages you need are on the install cd. If the system is a laptop,  just use a wired connection and get what you need
[16:13] <ActionParsnip> Shpngld: broadcom are one of the easiest to setup
[16:14] <shpngld> ActionParsnip, well its not..its oldschool desktop but i do have LAN card
[16:14] <jhutchins_wk> shpngld: If you don't have a backup of the system and it can't read the HD well enough to boot you're probably too late.  You can try booting to a live CD like systemrescuecd, but it probably won't read the disk any better.
[16:14] <shpngld> ActionParsnip,  It wasnt at all for me....
[16:14] <mega1> in ubuntu server12.04 how do i limit a user to 20 gig
[16:14] <ActionParsnip> Shpngld: the broadcom guide shows how to do it, step by step
[16:14] <shpngld> ActionParsnip,  for now its redaing it...but its gettin more often needed to restart
[16:14] <ActionParsnip> Mega1: look into quota

[16:36] <blami> raven_: either install nvidia driver or upgrade kernel. I recommend you first one :)
[16:36] <Ripper003> Microphone works locally i.e. sound recorder, but internet telephony bar Mumble doesn't work?
[16:36] <TheLordOfTime> andrea__, it should be >> for appends.
[16:36] <derram001> hello how do i chat
[16:36] <TheLordOfTime> andrea__, otherwise i think > just overwrites
[16:36] <blami> raven_: bug is fixed in 3.8 git but that's really not kernel for production machine :)
[16:36] <andrea__> TheLordOfTime:  k thanks :)
[16:36] <jhutchins_wk> LambdaMutt: How many years have you been on irc?
[16:36] <raven_> blami, with nvidia driver its the same freeze and i used a few kernels now
[16:36] <ActionParsnip> Raven_: have you tested RAM health?  You may also want to clean out your fans if the system is old-ish
[16:36] <ActionParsnip> Andreq__: >> appends
[16:36] <wolf_shadow> but i'll have to install it from developers page then
[16:37] <LambdaMutt> jhutchins_wk, I have been in software for about 34 years now
[16:37] <ActionParsnip> Andrea__: or you can pipe to tee -a  to add too :-)
[16:37] <ct529> ActionParsnip: and solved ....
[16:37] <Monotoko> LambdaMutt... you remember ARPA?
[16:37] <raven_> ActionParsnip, the machine is cold enough and ram has 0 errors
[16:37] <jhutchins_wk> LambdaMutt: That's not what I asked, and I've still got you beat.
[16:37] <blami> raven_: is it optimus setup or nvidia only?
[16:37] <ActionParsnip> Ct529: what was it?
[16:38] <ct529> ActionParsnip: gvfs ....
[16:38] <LambdaMutt> jhutchins_wk, if you would like credentials, speak to the former North American VP of Dev for Ubuntu
[16:38] <raven_> blami, what do you mean exactly?
[16:38] <ActionParsnip> Raven_: when did you lsst test ram?
[16:38] <ActionParsnip> Ct529? Nice
[16:38] <jhutchins_wk> LambdaMutt: My point is that only an idiot would judge anything by irc traffic.
[16:38] <blami> raven_: do you have laptop with two video cards (nvidia + intel) or just nvidia only?
[16:39] <raven_> ActionParsnip, two days ago
[16:39] <raven_> blami, just nvidia i think
[16:39] <ActionParsnip> Raven_: cool
=== Teufelchen_ is now known as Teufelchen
[16:39] <blami> raven_: then I don't know ... it may be also hardware problem ...
[16:40] <blami> raven_: does similar thing happen when you boot in console?
[16:41] <arunscape> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1494514/
[16:41] <arunscape> please help. I'm new to linux, decided to try out ubuntu. created a new partition, and replaced windows 8 boot manager with grub 2
[16:41] <arunscape> now windows doesn't want to start and neither does the recovery environment.
[16:41] <jhutchins_wk> raven_: video ram corruption.  You said your ram was good - did you run memtest?
[16:41] <raven_> blami, not tested yet but it happened a freeze this way at entering the grub menu 1 time
[16:41] <LambdaMutt> Monotoko, if it helps to 'date' me, I ran a Fidonet BBS in the mid 80's
[16:42] <LambdaMutt> First 'internet' connection was long distance to california
[16:42] <LambdaMutt> SLIP
[16:42] <jhutchins_wk> LambdaMutt: Really?  What node?
[16:42] <LambdaMutt> Yes, really.
[16:42] <jhutchins_wk> LambdaMutt: What node?
[16:42] <LambdaMutt> I'm not going to tell you, because I don't want my dox tied to this nick
[16:42] <kke05597> ciao

[16:44] <LambdaMutt> Admirable
[16:44] <LambdaMutt> Awesome stuff.
[16:44] <LambdaMutt> I'm guessing you're talking about the 1st Gulf War?
[16:44] <blami> raven_: that sounds alot like hardware problem
[16:45] <jhutchins_wk> LambdaMutt: So the fact that in spite of what noise there is on the channel, we manage to provide realtime support, often at a higher level than the paid support you get from RedHat is much more of an asset than the liability of inexperienced users giving bad advice.
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[16:45] <blami> raven_: one of my older thinkpads with nvidia card had similar problem caused by cold joints
[16:45] <LambdaMutt> Tiemann and I have differing views about that.
[16:45] <raven_> blami, how to verify
[16:46] <blami> raven_: does your laptop overheat?
[16:46] <LambdaMutt> Pass on a message to him, will you? The acoustics in his studio still suck.
[16:46] <blami> raven_: in case of my laptop it was sufficient to go into bios and wait to prove the error
[16:47] <blami> raven_: basically if it happens before linux kernel is booted (e.g. in grub) it's very likely it has nothing to do with linux
[16:48] <sw0rdfish> can I put a button into internet explorer to translate websites for me?
[16:48] <DJones> sw0rdfish: Internet explorer?
[16:49] <sw0rdfish> errr...
[16:49] <sw0rdfish> nvm
[16:49] <sw0rdfish> wrong window :P
[16:49] <bugtraq> klk
[16:50] <raven_> blami, no its cold enough
[16:50] <machicola> what is the typical script or location I would want to put shell commands to start programs or make configuration adjustments at startup?
[16:50] <bugtraq> alguien que sepa de hacker
[16:51] <jhutchins_wk> machicola: System level or user/graphic level?
[16:51] <machicola> user/graphic level
[16:51] <bugtraq> ok
[16:51] <raven_> ActionParsnip, blami ill test it within bios. hopefully its no hardware problem.......
[16:51] <ska> I want to boot to a text based menu, instead of a login console. All in text mode.. Is there an easy way to do this?

[16:52] <bonno> hello i am reading about hard & soft links.. and i am trying to create a hard link between 2 files which are on ntfs file system.. i am getting "no such file or directory" error.. why?
[16:52] <katarakt> Question: I'm trying to pipe my external IP address to the whois command, but I can't seem to get it to work.  I'm using curl -s http://checkip.dyndns.org/ | sed 's/[a-zA-Z<>/ :]//g' which returns my IP, but when I pipe to whois i get the whois help.  Any suggestions about problem?
[16:52] <bonno> does ln works only between ext filesystems?
[16:52] <jhutchins_wk> machicola: Usually the system will "remember" what was running when you last shut down and restart it.
[16:52] <machicola> jhutchins_wk, gnome fallback rather
[16:53] <jhutchins_wk> bonno: ntfs does not support links.
[16:53] <ska> ubottu: or I can just remove all X.
[16:53] <ubottu> ska: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[16:53] <bonno> ok.. thank you :)
[16:53] <jhutchins_wk> ska: Just turn off the dm - probably gdm.
[16:53] <machicola> yea, i'm half doing it for practicality and half to learn something about scripts etc.
[16:53] <machicola> i can't stand unity :-(
[16:53] <jhutchins_wk> ska: I use rcconf, but there may be a better way in ubuntu.
[16:54] <tqrst> what package should I install to get liblapack.so.3 on quantal? I looked at http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/liblapack.so.3 but those packages (libatlas3-base and liblapack3) don't seem to exist.
[16:54] <machicola> drives me crazy lol
[16:54] <machicola> although it seems well made and i'm sure is great for some

[17:02] <katarakt> <kslater> thanks.  glad it's not just me.  I've also tried writing the ip to a file, and then using that file for whois.  but then i get an error that "no whois server is known  for this kind of object"...it's like a binary/ascii problem or something...wrong format...
[17:02] <kslater> tqrst: is that a better form?

[17:04] <tqrst> kslater: fewer issues with escaping and nesting
[17:04] <jhutchins_wk> katarakt: You might ask in #bash.  What command are you using to get the ip?
[17:04] <tqrst> kslater: you can do $(foo $(bar)), etc.

[17:11] <folorn> anyone know if there's a place to get help with a specific linux distro? im having some real trouble i tried the #linux channel but it wont let me talk in it to answer questions ??
[17:11] <mutantkeyboard> @folorn which distro?
[17:12] <folorn> redhat 9.0 mutantkeyboard
[17:12] <jhutchins_wk> katarakt: You may find it easier to use something like the dyndns client.
[17:13] <mutantkeyboard> hmm... don't they have #redhat room dedicated for support?
[17:14] <bazhang> mutantkeyboard, rhel should be
[17:14] <mutantkeyboard> @bahzang indeed :)
[17:14] <bazhang> try #rhel
[17:15] <cdavis> Does anyone know if there is a max file size when using the paste file feature in minicom?
[17:15] <katarakt> it looks like dyndns client will return my ip (which I can already do) but it won't give me any whois info...am I missing something?
[17:15] <DJones> folorn: Certain channels require you to register your nickname before you can chat in them, that may be why you couldn't speak in #linux
[17:16] <folorn> oh thanks Djones
[17:17] <jhutchins_wk> cdavis: Shouldn't be, but that's an odd way to do things.
[17:19] <cdavis> jhutchins_wk: why is that odd? I have a huge set of settings that need added to a switch stack?
[17:19] <larst> hi

[17:19] <rom> hay, what happenes when i install ubuntu into my previously partitioned disk. having three, one for ubuntu, one for data partition and another for windows?
[17:20] <rom> i hav taken backup for only my ubuntu disk?
[17:20] <rick_a> just make sure you wont erase the other partions
[17:21] <rom> is there any risk of the other partitions even if there is an error in installation?
[17:21] <rick_a> can even somebody see what im typing here? lol
[17:21] <noname234> hi, folks. Have a question. I'm using ssh to remote control my PC ubuntu. Some controls works, but some (like starting bash scripts) don't. Why is that?
[17:21] <rom> ya i got that man, jus making sure..
[17:22] <rick_a> okey good  ;P do you dual boot 3 Operatingsystems?
[17:22] <jhutchins_wk> cdavis: Ah, cool, yes, that should work.  There might be other ways to pipe a file to the serial port, but pasting into minicom should work.

[18:00] <ska> I make changes to /etc/init/tty1.conf, how do I get system to re-read/execute those?
[18:01] <Malcom234> bazhang: hplib status:installed - does thios mean i have the latest version?
[18:01] <mcsx3> bazhang: Gee! I don't even know what that is.
[18:01] <ismell> can anyone post the default sources.list for ubuntu 12.04 ?

[18:02] <jrtappers> Hello, is there a way to run a live CD from grub on wubi
[18:03] <Malcom234> bazhang i did a apt-get update and installhplib -> Newest version already exists
[18:04] <ska> initclt restart tty1
[18:04] <rick_a> erase the whole Harddrive and Install Ubuntu 12.04 and be happy.
[18:05] <jrtappers> Hello, is there a way to run a live CD from grub on wubi, I would like to be able to try linux live cd's on my laptop with wubi
[18:05] <zwirc> Coul someone maby help me setting up my SSD and Raid 1 ? :D
[18:05] <jrtappers> zwirc, have you got multiple drives?
[18:06] <rick_a> why not get Virtualbox? its great
[18:06] <klixa> jrtappers live cd's can be run all by theselves without grub OR wubi
[18:06] <klixa> themselves*
[18:07] <lietu> I can't seem to figure out which package I need in Ubuntu (server) 12.04 to get the CLI "mail" -command .. can anyone tell me?
[18:07] <jrtappers> klixa, no CD drive
[18:07] <klixa> jrtappers oh so you mean iso's?
[18:07] <jrtappers> So I would prefer to run the ISO from grub
[18:07] <jrtappers> yh
[18:08] <klixa> jrtappers virtualbox is probably the better route to take then, since you have no drive
[18:08] <jrtappers> Performance impact?
[18:08] <jrtappers> It's a weak netbook
[18:08] <klixa> jrtappers then get a usb stick, and run iso's from it
[18:08] <jrtappers> I heard ISO's can be run from grub
[18:08] <klixa> jrtappers you can write an iso to a usb stick..or even an sd card
[18:09] <klixa> jrtappers perhaps iso's can br run virtually with grub, wubi or whatever, but i have NO clue how that works…sorry
[18:09] <klixa> be*
[18:09] <jrtappers> ok
[18:09] <klixa> i personally use an asd card on my netbook… and then virtualbox on my laptop
[18:09] <yeats> purezen: there's a bug report on that but I'm not able to find it again :-/

[18:11] <zwirc> How do I see what disk ubuntu is installed on?
[18:11] <agliodbs> howdy!  I have a brand-new Asus Zenbook Prime.  Should I install 12.04 or 12.10, and why?
[18:12] <jrtappers> Whats the best way to run multiple Live CD ISO's from one USB drive?
[18:12] <agliodbs> jrtappers: *multiple*?
[18:12] <xakep> Hello
[18:13] <jrtappers> Its 32 GB, and I like to try multiple distors
[18:13] <jrtappers> *distros
[18:13] <seednode> jrtappers, you could emulate the Windows tool YUMI
[18:13] <seednode> But that's all I've got
[18:13] <yeats> purezen: yeah - I think the version with the fix is 12.07.30-0ubuntu2, which wasn't pushed to the repos yet when I looked last week
[18:13] <agliodbs> zwirc: what do you mean by "disk"?
[18:13] <seednode> I'm sure there's another way, but YUMI worked really well for me
[18:13] <xangua> jrtappers: i use multiboot http://liveusb.info/dotclear/index.php?pages/install
[18:13] <agliodbs> also: why is 32-bit Ubuntu still "recommended"?
[18:14] <xangua> pretty easy, you just drag or select the iso's

[18:14] <jrtappers> xangua, thanks, il take a look
[18:14] <yeats> agliodbs: because it will run on any system
[18:15] <yeats> agliodbs: if you like upgrading every 6 months, go with 12.10, otherwise, 12.04 IMHO
[18:15] <zwirc> what hdd
=== Guest15450 is now known as cmind
[18:15] <purezen> yeats: yeah.. that might be the cause.. will wait for the next update then..:)
[18:15] <zwirc> i have 3 hdd
[18:15] <agliodbs> yeats: ok.  I generally pull the latest, but I'm seeing 12.04 recommended in the forums for the Zenbook
[18:15] <zwirc> but dont know what unbuntu is installed on
[18:15] <yeats> purezen: I'm waiting too ;-)
[18:16] <yeats> agliodbs: 12.04 is LTS, so a longer support time and presumably more stable (though I don't have trouble running LTS releases) - not running a Zenbook though if that makes a differenc3e
[18:17] <yeats> s/LTS releases/non-LTS releases/
[18:17] <agliodbs> zwirc: well, you can fairly easily see the logical name of the HDD which is mounted, but figuring out which physical disk that is is complicated
[18:18] <agliodbs> yeats: well, I can always in stall 12.04 and upgrade if I need something
[18:18] <agliodbs> the tricky part is the USB install
[18:18] <ShaunR> where can i get a live cd version?  i'm having a hell of a time finding it
[18:18] <yeats> agliodbs: why tricky?
[18:18] <xangua> ShaunR: ubuntu.com
[18:18] <zwirc> agliodbs: yeah, it sould be installed on a SSD, but i cant figure out how to check whats what disk :P
[18:19] <agliodbs> yeats: (a) creating the bootable USB stick
[18:19] <agliodbs> yeats: especially since I need to create it from a mac.
[18:19] <ShaunR> xangua: i've looked but the download section just keeps showing me the iso's for installing
[18:19] <agliodbs> and I can't remember which brand of USB stick worked last time
[18:20] <agliodbs> yeats: with 10.04, I've had trouble with Ubuntu not remounting swap when coming back from suspend.  is that fixed in 12.04?
[18:20] <b3nj> help me, firefox does not play sound
[18:20] <yeats> agliodbs: try unetbootin http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ - there's a mac version - and any old USB stick should work in my experience
[18:20] <yeats> agliodbs: I haven't experienced that problem, so I don't know
[18:21] <agliodbs> yeats: oh?  There's a mac version now?  cool, I'll try it
[18:21] <zwirc> agliodbs: but how do I set folders for each disk?
[18:21] <agliodbs> yeats: actually, a lot of cheap USB sticks don't boot properly
[18:21] <zwirc> for example I want one user to use one disk, and take backups on another backup folder that is on the other disk
[18:21] <xangua> ShaunR: burn the iso as image to a cd/dvd and you got a live cd/dvd
[18:22] <xangua> i preffer usb
[18:22] <yeats> agliodbs: huh - I've not had problems - I mostly use SanDisk, but that's not because of a brand preference ;-)
[18:22] <b3nj> help me, no sound in firefox
[18:22] <agliodbs> yeats: well, stick with sandisk then
[18:22] <yeats> yep ;-)
[18:23] <agliodbs> yeats: I have like 1000 generic USB drives with people's marketing messages on them from conferences
[18:23] <agliodbs> those don't work
[18:23] <yeats> agliodbs: I use those too
[18:23] <yeats> no problems in my case

[18:53] <dufa> b3nj: the html5 player on youtube is accessible form the link at the bottom of youtube that says " Try something new"

[18:53] <cheebu> Hi all... just installed Ubuntu 12.04 How do i check if trim is working?
[18:53] <l057c0d3r> yeah..  its a good one too :-) your welcome
[18:54] <bekks> cheebu: By looking the output of "mount" - seeing "discard" there, tells you that TRIM is active.
[18:54] <usr13> b3nj: Actually, you should cut to the chase.  Let's do this:
[18:54] <l057c0d3r> don't know if you noticed it.. but at the end of the cli guide.. there is a pdf.  its like a cheat book.. rather nice
[18:55] <usr13> b3nj: http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/completion/?installer=Flash_Player_11.2_for_other_Linux_(.tar.gz)_64-bit
[18:56] <usr13> b3nj: Download it to Downloads.  Open a terminal, cd Downloads  Ok... there yet?
[18:56] <b3nj> usr13: i run commands that were on that page
[18:57] <usr13> b3nj:  Ok.. well never mind.
[18:57] <usr13> Let me know if it works.
[18:57] <b3nj> l057c0d3r: you still fscking with windows?
[18:57] <usr13> b3nj: But this would be easier.
[18:57] <l057c0d3r> na.. i got everything i want on linux..
[18:57] <xangua> usr13: b3nj adobe-flashplugin package already installs the 64 bit version
[18:58] <b3nj> xangua: unfortunately, adobe-flashplugin has no installation candidate
[18:58] <usr13> xangua: Tell b3nj  He's the one with the problem.
[18:58] <b3nj> usr13: should i reboot or something after that?
[18:58] <xangua> !partner
[18:58] <xangua> b3nj: you need to enable parther repository first
[18:58] <ubottu> Canonical's partner repositories provide a location for software vendors to publish applications. The repo itself can be added by running this in a !terminal: « sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner" »
[18:58] <l057c0d3r> hmm i got flash through the restricted extra's package... i take it its not version 11 or this conversation would be irrelevant
[18:58] <usr13> b3nj: I'll tell you how to fix it when you get ready.

[19:01] <VlanX> any idea how i can calculate the hash of a file from the terminal?
[19:02] <b3nj> xangua, adobe-flashplugin installed now
[19:02] <b3nj> usr13: i have installed adobe-flashplugin
[19:02] <w3s7y> Vlanx, 'md5sum <file>'
[19:03] <dufa> VlanX: if you need a very specific hash openssl will propably do the job
[19:03] <VlanX> w3s7y: ty
[19:03] <b3nj> xangua: still no sound in firefox
[19:03] <usr13> b3nj: Ok good.
[19:03] <b3nj> usr13: but still no sound
[19:03] <VlanX> nope md5 is fine, just to verify integrity :)
[19:03] <w3s7y> For a MD5 hash, open-ssl has many, many hash functions...
[19:03] <w3s7y> But dont think it's installed by default

[19:04] <b3nj> arshavin: hi to india
[19:04] <usr13> b3nj: Download Adobe Flashplayer 11.2 64bit from http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/  Get the gz  version. Unpack it and move libflashplayer.so to the plugins directory.  Try that.

[19:04] <arshavin> md5sum should be installed
[19:04] <b3nj> l057c0d3r: sound works fine in chrome

[19:05] <b3nj> arshavin: are you from russia?
[19:05] <w3s7y> arshavin, yeah md5sum is on ubuntu as std, open-ssl has more functions but the apt pkg has to be installed
[19:05] <arshavin> no I already told you where i was from

[19:07] <domino> hey everyone. I've recently encountered an issue and have tried numerous suggestions (to no avail) to try and correct it, so im coming here to see if anyone has any ideas. when I run an apt-get update it fails with this output: https://gist.github.com/d9045e2660167ac33617
[19:08] <domino> (im using ubuntu server 12.04.1
[19:08] <domino> )
[19:09] <TAsn> Hey guys. What should I do to get a package off the ubuntu repos? I work on e17 and ubuntu has a 3 year old package in it's repos. This is very annoying as users think badly of e17 because of it (it was an early dev version). I would like that if possible this package will be removed altogether or upgraded to the stable release, but what should I do in order to achieve that?
[19:09] <MonkeyDust> domino  there's also #ubuntu-server
[19:09] <cheebu> Guys i rememebr there was a comand to tell me if TRIM is on  anybody know?
[19:09] <domino> MonkeyDust: oh i wasn't aware. I'll try there. thank you
[19:09] <usr13> b3nj: Show us what you have there now:  ls -l /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins |pastebinit
[19:09] <Optichip> TAsn: local mirror?
[19:09] <MonkeyDust> TAsn  3 years old, what ubuntu version?
[19:09] <k1l> TAsn: i would get in contact with the maintainer of that package.
[19:09] <b3nj> usr13: how to unpack the archive?
[19:09] <DJones> TAsn: Probably a good starting point would be to contact the package maintainer
[19:10] <k1l> TAsn: packages.ubuntu.com tells you who that is
[19:10] <usr13> b3nj: tar xvf file.gz
[19:10] <TAsn> MonkeyDust, newest one.
[19:10] <TAsn> that's a good starting point for the future
[19:10] <TAsn> I'm sure
[19:10] <usr13> b3nj: The first file you see is it.
[19:10] <TAsn> but is it for the old versions as well?
[19:10] <TAsn> anyhow, the maintainer is Ubuntu MOTU
[19:10] <TAsn> whatever that means.
[19:11] <k1l> TAsn: which package?
[19:11] <dkessel> TAsn, i guess you will find someone in #ubuntu-motu to help you
[19:11] <TAsn> e17
[19:11] <b3nj> usr13: i think when it unpacked everything was moved to the right directories
[19:11] <usr13> b3nj: sudo mv libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
[19:11] <MonkeyDust> TAsn  motu = masters of the universe
[19:11] <TAsn> thanks
[19:11] <blami> TAsn: I would suggest opening an RFE for upstream update
[19:11] <usr13> b3nj: No, it wasn't.
[19:11] <TAsn> blami, but I can't do that for 10.04 can I ?
[19:11] <usr13> b3nj:  you have to manually put it there.
[19:11] <blami> TAsn: afaik no
[19:11] <b3nj> usr13: but the unpacked files are already in /usr
[19:12] <TAsn> ok.
[19:12] <blami> TAsn: and why would you do that? Not sure if 10.04 is LTS ...
[19:12] <TAsn> I'll ask at #ubuntu-motu
[19:12] <b3nj> usr13: no they are not
[19:12] <usr13> b3nj: Nope
[19:12] <k1l> TAsn: but keep in mind, that ubuntu doesn take new relases into old versions (in general). so the new e17 will be included in the 13,04 ubuntu (if its not past the deadlines already)
[19:12] <TAsn> it's not a new release
[19:12] <blami> k1l: i think it is
[19:12] <TAsn> it's the only release
[19:12] <TAsn> the previous ones were broken dev snapshots
[19:12] <blami> TAsn: but it wasnt there in time of 10.04
[19:12] <l057c0d3r> cheebu, go here https://sites.google.com/site/lightrush/random-1/checkiftrimonext4isenabledandworking
[19:12] <TAsn> that got into ubuntu by some unfortunate mistake
[19:12] <usr13> Show us what you have there now.  ls -l /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ |pastebinit
[19:13] <blami> TAsn: that's important ... LTS get bugfixes, not new features afaik
[19:13] <usr13> b3nj: send resulting URL
[19:13] <Letalis> is there any information on the new ubuntu phones out there that isnt just an announcement? i was curios just how much of it is actually ubuntu and how much of it remains android.
[19:13] <TAsn> blami, sure
[19:13] <Nevin> Tex_Nick : I fixed the problem with installing Ubuntu. Curious if you want to know in case someone else may have the same problem.
[19:13] <TAsn> blami, that's why I said removed or upgraded. :)
[19:13] <ania_> hi please help i just remove tomuch by using sudo apt-get purge wine* ....all packaged with wine name .....and ive seen stuff from system needed purged ...how to reverse purge command??
[19:13] <TAsn> I think removing that would be just fine.
[19:13] <TAsn> blami, the thing is
[19:13] <arshavin> I can't get oxford oald 8 sound when i install it from linux binary but it works with wine'
[19:13] <usr13> b3nj: It's like I said, you have to manually move the file to the plugins directory.  /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
[19:13] <TAsn> blami, people apt-get install e17
[19:14] <blami> TAsn: you can always start account on launchpad, create PPA with latest packages for 10.4 and provide info about them on project homepage
[19:14] <TAsn> blami, and get a crappy piece of sw
[19:14] <TAsn> blami, already done.
[19:14] <b3nj> usr13: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1496647/
[19:14] <blami> TAsn: users then are supposed to add ppa and apt-get install e17
[19:14] <TAsn> blami, that's what *intelligent* users do
[19:14] <TAsn> but others
[19:14] <TAsn> just apt-get install e17
[19:14] <TAsn> and ditch it after a couple of minutes
[19:14] <TAsn> orr complain about it in our trac/support chans
[19:15] <arshavin> it complains about shockwave player in linux
[19:15] <TAsn> blami, that's why I'd like it removed, so at least people will be able to get the proper package without confusion.
[19:15] <blami> TAsn: so close tickets redirecting those to tutorial
[19:15] <k1l> TAsn: http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/e17  see the maintainer part on the right.
[19:15] <usr13> b3nj: See?  You have  libflashplayer.so  and flashplugin-alternative.so  and flashplugin-alternative.so is a symlink to /etc/alternatives/mozilla-flashplugin
[19:15] <TAsn> k1l, MOTU
[19:15] <arshavin> i don't think shockwave player has a linux client
[19:15] <b3nj> usr13: so?
[19:15] <usr13> b3nj: From where you just now unpacked all the files do what I said.
[19:16] <k1l> TAsn: you emailed the email adress thats mentioned there?
[19:16] <ania_> anyone pleas
[19:16] <usr13> b3nj: sudo mv libflashplayer.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
[19:16] <b3nj> usr13: i have moved it
[19:16] <TAsn> k1l, not yet, trying #ubuntu-motu
[19:16] <b3nj> usr13: already
[19:16] <TAsn> first
[19:16] <k1l> TAsn: or filed a bug on launchpad (which is the first way to do)
[19:17] <usr13> b3nj: Show us.
[19:17] <usr13> Show us what you have there now.  ls -l /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/ |pastebinit
[19:17] <b3nj> usr13: already sent link
[19:17] <TAsn> k1l, ok, will do one of them.
[19:17] <usr13> b3nj: The date is Nov 28th?
[19:17] <TAsn> or both
[19:17] <b3nj> usr13:  no
[19:17] <usr13> b3nj:  I don't think so.
[19:18] <b3nj> usr13 http://paste.ubuntu.com/1496664/
[19:18] <k1l> TAsn: i would file a bug before. im pretty sure they will ask after your filed bug :)
[19:18] <k1l> TAsn: and since the package itselv comes from debian i would talk to debian, too :)
[19:19] <TAsn> it will be fixed in debian
[19:19] <blami> I wanted to point out that it is imported packages
[19:19] <TAsn> it's already fixed in unstable
[19:19] <blami> package
[19:19] <usr13> b3nj:  Well, you still didn't do it because we STILL see "Nov 28 00:03 libflashplayer.so"
[19:19] <usr13> b3nj: So, what's up?
[19:19] <b3nj> usr13: wait
[19:20] <ania_> can you help me please?
[19:20] <b3nj> usr13: dated nov 28 so what?
[19:21] <usr13> b3nj: Here's the deal.  You can either use /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so  or /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flashplugin-alternative.so
[19:21] <usr13> b3nj: (Because that is not today's date.)
[19:21] <b3nj> usr13: why should it be today's date?
[19:21] <usr13> b3nj:  If /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so  is there, it will be used.
[19:22] <blami> ania_: let me see my crystal ball to find out whats your problem
[19:22] <Muphrid> ania_: I dont think you can remake the purge command
[19:22] <usr13> b3nj:  If you replace /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so  with the one you just downloaded, you will see the new date on it.
[19:22] <Muphrid> you can still reinstall them back using the same logic
[19:22] <ania_> how to undo purge .....it remove almost everything with wine* name
[19:22] <b3nj> usr13: reallY?
[19:22] <usr13> b3nj: Or, if you delete /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/libflashplayer.so  /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flashplugin-alternative  will be used
=== russell is now known as Guest16447
[19:23] <usr13> b3nj: Yea really
[19:23] <ania_> blami: sudo apt-get purge wine* it remove me about 800 mb of system ....
[19:23] <ania_> and i found that on ask ubuntu page
[19:23] <b3nj> usr13: when i unpack the archive the date on libflashplayer.so is nov 28
[19:23] <DaemonicApathy> Is it causing problems, ania_?
[19:23] <usr13> b3nj: If you botched up the command the first time, you'll need to unpack the file again.  tar xvf name.gz
[19:24] <ania_>  yes
[19:24] <Muphrid> ania_: such as?
[19:24] <blami> ania_: in /var/log/apt is file called history.log or history.log.gz1 ... they contain all operations done with apt
[19:24] <blami> ania_: just look what packages were removed and install them again
[19:24] <b3nj> usr13: so i am sure that the date is not changed
[19:25] <b3nj> usr13: when you move a file from one place to another
[19:25] <usr13> b3nj: ...downloading the file now...
[19:25] <b3nj> usr13: what is it?
[19:25] <ania_> http://pastebin.com/q7CgEBbu
[19:26] <TAsn> anyhow, discussion moved to #ubuntu-motu thanks
[19:26] <Muphrid> ania_: installing ubuntu-desktop back should get the important parts again
[19:27] <usr13> b3nj: I guess.  Try it and see if it works then.
[19:27] <usr13> b3nj: That's  weird.
[19:27] <b3nj> usr13: should i reboot my machine?
=== root is now known as Guest37711
[19:28] <usr13> b3nj: No  Reboot will not do anything.  Restart firefox

[19:30] <Muphrid> ania_: that should be the base for a working-again system, the rest is up to you if you want to reinstall
[19:31] <usr13> b3nj: At this point you'll need to just experiment.  sudo rm /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/flashplugin-alternative.so
[19:31] <usr13> b3nj: Restart firefox and see.
[19:32] <ania_> ok thx.....the should put advice to remove on ask ubuntu
[19:32] <Muphrid> ania_: xchat, gnome-shell, gnome-panel and gnome-tweak-tool are not in that package if you want to install them again
[19:33] <usr13> b3nj: Did you try it?
[19:34] <b3nj> usr13: i renamed flash-plugin alternative to .bak
[19:34] <usr13> b3nj: Why?
[19:34] <usr13> b3nj: It's just a symlink.
[19:34] <usr13> b3nj: you simply replace it
[19:35] <usr13> b3nj:  ln -sf /etc/alternatives/mozilla-flashplugin/flashplugin-alternative.so /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/
[19:35] <b3nj> usr13: now i have removed it
[19:35] <usr13> b3nj: So try and see.
[19:35] <usr13> b3nj: restart firefox
[19:36] <b3nj> usr13: still no sound

[19:43] <usr13> b3nj: I concede
[19:44] <Muphrid> theseb: you mean the global menu, or the window snap?
[19:44] <usr13> b3nj: "cannot access"  What was that?
[19:45] <EntropyAnn> Ven0m: haven't tried those. I just used wubi since the ubuntu website provided it, figured it would be most stable install tool

[19:46] <troybi> hi

[19:47] <theseb> Muphrid: i noticed CCSM has a "place windows" feature..do you know what that is? maybe if i turned that off?
[19:47] <troybi> who is familiar with asm 8086?
[19:47] <bekks> troybi: Why?

[19:48] <EntropyAnn> anybody successfully fix a dual boot install that gave you PFN List Corrupt on first restart?
[19:49] <usr13> b3nj: At:   http://www.noobslab.com/2012/10/important-thingstweaks-to-do-after.html   I see:  sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner"
[19:49] <usr13> b3nj: And:  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer
[19:50] <theseb> Muphrid: it looks like turning off "Snaping windows" and "place windows" is what i want...basically i don't want unity to guess what i want to do and do it for me
[19:50] <Muphrid> theseb: that should do it
[19:50] <usr13> b3nj: You might try that. Other than that, I don't  know.  (I use 32bit.)
[19:51] <usr13> b3nj: I suppose you could install firefox 32bit version  and the 32bit adobe flashplayer.
[19:51] <b3nj> usr13: flashplugin-installer is already the newest version

[19:52] <heywood> hi all. i've got 12.04.01 LTS on an old thinkpad (T43). Fn-F3 to completely turn off screen used to work under natty, but no longer does under precise. can anyone help?
[19:52] <japs> where should i install the operating system?
[19:52] <b3nj> usr13: where have you learnt all these tricks?
[19:53] <usr13> b3nj: I did that once on a 64bit system.  I installed 32bit libraries and the 32bit version of Firefox and 32bit Adobe Flashpler and it worked like a charm.
[19:53] <usr13> b3nj: You could try that.
[19:53] <b3nj> usr13: where have you learnt all those tricks like pastebinit?
[19:53] <usr13> b3nj: Is't it obvious?  (I experiment.)
[19:53] <scellef> does anybody know how to bring up the GRUB menu on an intel mac?
[19:54] <b3nj> usr13: a book or what?
[19:54] <scellef> short of using grub-reboot (which is utterly frustrating)
[19:55] <usr13> b3nj: I have an office here, (well, I tell everyone it is an office, but it is really just a computer lab that pretends to be an office).
[19:55] <usr13> b3nj: Yea, books too.
[19:55] <b3nj> usr13: what books?
[19:56] <DaemonicApathy> heywood: attach 'sleep 1 && xset dpms force off' except quotes to a shortcut.
[19:56] <theseb> Muphrid: how turn off maximizing ? that is still happening
[19:56] <usr13> Oh, I've got several.  One is "Wicked cool shell scripts" :)
[19:57] <b3nj> usr13: where had you learnt commands?
[19:57] <heywood> DaemonicApathy: do you mean to map that key sequence to a shortcut? i understand the commands, but not the mapping to shortcut part.
[19:57] <usr13> b3nj: Mostly man files
[19:57] <cdavis> What suggestion is there for a terminal emulator that isn't gnome-terminal and it lightweight that has good copy/paste with X11

[20:06] <ania_> DaemonicApathy, any idea?
[20:07] <DaemonicApathy> ania_: I would try opening it from a menu instead of from the terminal.
[20:07] <Fonsie> anybody available to helpme?
[20:07] <Fonsie> help me*

[20:09] <uebera||> Fonsie: The installer CD image has a rescue mode; either use this to get to the logs (only those messagr will help you here) or just re-install it.
[20:10] <Fonsie> i installed from usb drive so just try re-installing?
[20:10] <Chutney3k> Conky is run from command line. you can open a terminal and i think the basic run command is simply: conky

[20:10] <Fonsie> on-board
[20:11] <Fonsie> my pc is kinda of cruddy, its a gateway netbook with 1gb of ram and integrated graphics
[20:11] <linuxuz3r> is this also the channel for ubuntu for phones?
[20:11] <Chutney3k> hmm.. Fonsie, check out Lubuntu. it works much better on older hardware
[20:12] <Fonsie> this computer is new, when you say old are you referring to just lower spec?
[20:12] <Chutney3k> yes
[20:13] <Fonsie> ok, is the process for usb installation and such the same as ubuntu?
[20:13] <Chutney3k> just my advice. im sure some people have had Ubuntu running on similar spec hardware. on my laptop (5 years old) i ran both and found Lubuntu much better suited to the hardware
[20:13] <loxoko> usb installation?
[20:13] <Chutney3k> yes

[20:15] <Muphrid> linuxuz3r: #ubuntu-phone for discussion
[20:15] <Fonsie> one more question chutney, when i go to install lubuntu will it give me the option to replace ubuntu or do i need to manually un-install it first

[20:21] <Chutney3k> best to chooose "something else!"

[20:47] <rjcupid> its the 7pin s-vid port in an acer aspire-5050
[20:48] <bekks> rjcupid: Then you have to find out how these 7 pins are connected, and which signal goes where. And no, you cannot change that with a command line.
[20:50] <rjcupid> the video should be the same in both 4pin and 7pin but 7pin just has audio as well thats the other 3 connections

[21:32] <Monotoko> ahmedipa.. is your disk full?
[21:33] <Jordan_U> ahmedipa: That normally means that you have a buggy BIOS which can't properly handle large drives. You can work around your BIOS's limitation by creating a separate small /boot/ partition near the beginning of the drive.

[21:39] <marahin> oh
[21:39] <marahin> then chown user:user filedir
[21:40] <marahin> like chown cees:cees /home/cees/lmao.txt
[21:40] <marahin> it'll make you the owner of lmao.txt file
[21:40] <Ceees2> k let me try
[21:40] <TeamRocket1233c> One of the problems he's having is it don't recognize pressure sensitivity.
[21:40] <ahmedipa> I don't understand
[21:40] <ahmedipa> something
[21:40] <dec0de> TeamRocket1233, I'd make sure he has disabled pressure completely first. I had to do that with my 5

[21:41] <ahmedipa> after I got that problem
[21:41] <ahmedipa>    	 	 	 	 	 	   error: hd0 out of disk
[21:41] <dec0de> If it works after that then he will probably just need to make a fresh Xsetwacom config file
[21:41] <ahmedipa> I used CD live
[21:41] <ahmedipa> for ubuntu
[21:42] <ahmedipa> then I saw
[21:43] <Ceees2> marahin it says changing ownership of ".." not permitted.
[21:43] <wbf> I need help with a belkin f5d5050
[21:43] <marahin> Ceees2, try sudo chown user:user filedir?
[21:44] <TeamRocket1233c> Will it work if pressure sensitivity's disabled?
[21:44] <marahin> (sudo chown ceees:ceees /home/ceees/lmao.txt)
[21:44] <Ceees2> okay 1 sec
[21:44] <ahmedipa> http://i.imgur.com/hWXLO.png
[21:45] <dec0de> Thats what he needs to test, if it works with it disabled then its probably just a bad config file

[21:45] <Ceees2> okay that seems to work, but can it unlock all the directories inside it aswell?
[21:46] <TeamRocket1233c> His problem is the driver isn't installed.
[21:46] <ahmedipa> Jordan_U:  I will be back I hope that you understand my problem
[21:46] <wbf> PS: I need a linux driver for the f5d5050
[21:46] <TeamRocket1233c> And he don't know how to install it.
[21:46] <marahin> Ceees2, sure
[21:46] <wbf> and it's a belkin f5d5050
[21:47] <TeamRocket1233c> He downloaded the driver from Wacom, from what he's put out.
[21:47] <Ceees2> It doesn't do that atm
[21:47] <marahin> Ceees2, sudo chown ceees:ceees -R /home/ceees/images/
[21:47] <marahin> yes, you have to add -R flag (as: recursive)
[21:48] <TeamRocket1233c> How does one install the driver for an Intuos4 in Precise?
[21:48] <tqrst> can someone tell me why sound only works on the command line (ctrl-alt-f1 and company) and in gnome? I don't get any sound in xmonad. "alsamixer" shows the proper device - I just can't get any sound out of it.

[22:07] <WeThePeople> yeats, ok
[22:07] <yeats> WeThePeople: and when you reinstall, partition your drive so you have a separate partition (like /home) for your files you don't want to overwrite during upgrades/reinstalls
[22:08] <yeats> WeThePeople: or use LVM for the same purpose
[22:08] <WeThePeople> yeats, good idea

[22:30] <trendynick> nubie: in CLI tasks are faster sometimes (a 20k+ copy of files is significantly slower in GUI than CLI), less cpu use - sometimes they matter, but other than AIX or enterprise on the cheap (RHEL or cheaper) is really irrelevant if you're not in some poverty time, but I woulnd't say more as I am still in that time (for external reasons) and some get histerical if I say those saving are irrelevant in comparisson with others (even included)

[22:40] <zteam> Hi Guys!
[22:40] <Guest52619> hi
[22:40] <ichat> guest56 sy
[22:41] <ichat> my wih
[22:41] <ichat> fe
[22:41] <Desproges> guntbert, thanks you. I wanted to use do-release-upgrade  but it try to upgrade the system first and display lot of "error mirror not found"
[22:41] <zteam> Anybody knows where I can upgrade VLC to 2.05?
[22:41] <zteam> for Ubuntu 12.04?
[22:41] <ichat> ztem, there is  a  ppa for that
[22:42] <cham> MonkeyDust: you wanna see the output ?
[22:42] <guntbert> Desproges: best check what mirror you are using
[22:42] <MonkeyDust> cham  no, but so you can see where to find the cdrom
[22:43] <cham> MonkeyDust there is no cdrom in it
[22:44] <Zohan> hello guys
[22:44] <MonkeyDust> cham  you can't see what's not there
[22:44] <Desproges> guntbert, deb ftp://mirror.ovh.net/ftp.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ maverick
[22:44] <ichat> Guest52619,  just keep out of my private messages without asking  im not a  callgirl.. hell im not even female
[22:44] <Zohan> I need help with my fan, it's running on high speed all the time.
[22:44] <Zohan> Do you have any solutions?
[22:46] <ichat> zohan ... cut the wires   or use some fanspeed aplication ... there must be one out there
[22:46] <Emandab1> desproges, i think Guest52619 may be a bot - they just connected with me too - that's what ignore is for
[22:46] <Zohan> ichat: do you have any tip on fanspeed aplications?
[22:46] <fourq> Does it make sense that I have to 'sudo' my editor every time I want to use it? If I don't I can't save. Is this because I installed it in opt/ instead of home/ ?
[22:46] <usr13> Zohan: If it were mine, I'd be wanting it to run high speed so that my processor would not over-heat.
[22:47] <guntbert> Desproges: I'd change to the standard mirror first
[22:47] <Desproges> Emandab1, I didn't mentionned Guest52619, did I ?
[22:47] <ichat> no  but i could google one  and so could you
[22:47] <Emandab1> no - ichat did - my bad
[22:47] <Benxyzzy> When I do
[22:47] <Benxyzzy> nohup museekd &
[22:47] <Benxyzzy> at bash it prints some text and waits on a blank line. When I hit enter (to get back to the prompt), it says "Stopped" - i.e. the job is stopped. The whole point of nohup (and ampersand) is to run processes into the background, so why does the job immediately stop?
[22:47] <FloodBot1> Benxyzzy: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[22:47] <Emandab1> your message was just above his and i misread it
[22:47] <ichat> Emandab1,  what did i do?
[22:48] <ichat> ow lol
[22:48] <Emandab1> you mentioned guest52619 - they started a private chat with me too
[22:49] <Emandab1> i actually was hoping to get help on a question and not talk about whether you are male or female
[22:49] <Emandab1> I've been playing around with portable ubuntu on thumb drive and so far am rather unhappy with what I've been able to create
[22:49] <ichat> its a bit sad no? -
[22:49] <Emandab1> a bit
[22:49] <ariel__> can someone tell me where the root directory in my server
=== ariel__ is now known as Guest20572
[22:50] <Kion1> where in the file system is the file with my ppp sources?
[22:50] <Benxyzzy> arial__ : /root?
[22:50] <ichat> Emandab1,  - sorry cant help you with that
[22:50] <Emandab1> all the portable solutions i've tried seem to have limited persistence and are organized as an install CD (eg: use squashfs) - can i do better
[22:50] <Guest20572> benxyzzy is that a directory
[22:50] <Benxyzzy> arial__ : do you meant the home directory of the root user, or the root of the filesystem ?
[22:51] <Kion1> when I actualized to 12.10 somehow the daily Freecad got # commented
[22:51] <Kion1> where is the file to uncomment it
[22:51] <Emandab1> no problem ichat - you helped me know that you're not a female - that's help enough :-O
[22:51] <Zohan> Ichat: Sorry, my browser did freeze as always
[22:51] <Desproges> That's the point,  guntbert, maverick does not exists anymore :s
[22:51] <Zohan> So you do have any applications where i can reduce fan noise=
[22:51] <Benxyzzy> Guest20572: ls -Altrh /
[22:51] <Benxyzzy> drwx------   3 root root 4.0K Sep 25 13:14 root
[22:52] <Benxyzzy> (yes)
[22:52] <guntbert> Desproges: let met check something
[22:52] <ichat> zohan no i dont, i told you to google. ...  or even use the ubuntu app center its search is quite oke
[22:52] <Emandab1> zohan - replacing the fan is probably best if you can do that
[22:52] <ichat> i usually find what im looking for in a couple of minutes
[22:52] <Guest20572> benxyzzy you mean in the terminal?
[22:52] <Desproges> sure, and thanks you for your time anyway :)
[22:53] <ichat> Emandab1,  i am glad i was able to help (at least partially :P
[22:53] <F3Speech> Hey guys just a quick question, why does 'cd' fail when you run it with sudo?
[22:53] <Emandab1> alas - no help on portable linux - anyone??
[22:53] <cham> MonkeyDust after an update to ubuntu my CD/DVD is not recognized in Dolphine nor brasero
[22:53] <Emandab1> cd is a shell command
[22:53] <Benxyzzy> Guest20572: Yes type
[22:53] <Benxyzzy> ls -Altrh /
[22:53] <Benxyzzy> at the terminal and you will see. Asuming Arial__ 's question is what we're talking about and not my question
[22:54] <Emandab1> f3speech - cd is a shell command not an executable
[22:54] <Emandab1> so sudo can't find it to run it
[22:54] <bekks> Emandab1: Whats your actual problem you are facing with a portable Ubuntu?
[22:54] <MonkeyDust> cham  dolphin... kubuntu?
[22:54] <Emandab1> no problem - just no satisfaction
[22:54] <bekks> Emandab1: Because cd is a shell builtin and no command.
[22:54] <cham> MonkeyDust yeah
[22:55] <F3Speech> Always assumed you could prefix any line with sudo and have it run
[22:55] <bekks> F3Speech: Which is wrong.
[22:55] <Emandab1> i want my linux on a thumbdrive to behave like linux on my hard drive
[22:55] <Blue1> F3Speech: bad assumption
[22:55] <Benxyzzy> F3Speech: Temporarily become the root user with sudo su and then run cd?
[22:55] <Guest20572> Benxyzzy what does that have to do with what im talking about
[22:55] <MonkeyDust> cham  no experience with kde/dolphin, sorry
[22:55] <Emandab1> i want it to use the 32 gigs of space - perform with equal or near-equal speed (I have a hopping fast USB)
[22:56] <F3Speech> Blue1:  apparently so lol
[22:56] <bekks> Benxyzzy: sudo su is a bad approach. Just use sudo -i
[22:56] <Benxyzzy> Guest20572: Nothing, you asked me
[22:56] <cham> MonkeyDust yeah it's not recognized with nautilus either
[22:56] <Blue1> F3Speech: just got here what is it you are trying to do?
[22:56] <Emandab1> F3Speech: you probably are doing something wrong if you are trying to cd with sudo
[22:56] <F3Speech> not really an issue just wondered got used to been in here last few days, though hell ill just ask :)
[22:57] <Guest20572> its a server question where is phpbb it says the root directory to change a file
[22:57] <Zohan> ok, so ubntu freezes all the time. Do you have any ideas why it does that?
[22:57] <guntbert> Desproges: that was a misconception (here), I thought "server" was supported longer
[22:57] <Zohan> happens a lot when I play flash
[22:57] <WeThePeople> how do i access home dir in a guest session?
[22:58] <rsser1> is there any ubuntu mobile to test?
[22:58] <Emandab1> F3Speech: if you run "$ which cd" you'll see that no command is found - ditto for "$ man cd"
[22:58] <bekks> WeThePeople: The guest session is not designed to do so.
[22:58] <Blue1> WeThePeople: cd ~
[22:58] <Emandab1> F3Speech: the doc for cd is inside of "man bash"
[22:58] <bekks> WeThePeople: You can only access the home directory of the guest user.
[22:58] <WeThePeople> bekks, is there a hack i can use
[22:58] <Benxyzzy> bekks: You're right, I stand corrected. Although it is recommended in Ubuntu's documentation here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables
[22:59] <Blue1> WeThePeople: there's no place like home
[22:59] <guntbert> Desproges: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades seems outdated, but you should be able to get by
[22:59] <Emandab1> F3Speech: the reason cd can't be an executable is because it tweaks the kernel's internal data about the current process - if you run it as a command as sudo would do then you're changing the current directory for the wrong processs
[22:59] <bekks> Blue1: ?
[22:59] <cham> my cd/dvd is not recognized after an update
[22:59] <WeThePeople> bekks, do you know how to fix broken pipes?
[22:59] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: Looking back at your older question, you actually can re-install Ubuntu while preserving /home/, even when it's not on a separate partition.
[22:59] <bekks> WeThePeople: Huh? What do you mean exactly?
[23:00] <Emandab1> WeThePeople: i've found that duct tape works well on broken pipes
[23:00] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, do you have a link
[23:00] <WeThePeople> lol
[23:00] <XDS2012> hi guys
[23:00] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: What is your end goal with the guest session?
[23:00] <danny> how to i make a unity webapp for gmail to open in chrome or chromium would rather chrome
[23:01] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, i just need to login to my super user account. there are two error msg. 1) cannot upgrade .ICEauthority file, 2) cannot write byte broken pipe
[23:02] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, guest session works
[23:02] <guntbert> WeThePeople: thast what you get for sudoing for a GUI app
[23:02] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: That first error is the result of using sudo to run a GUI app, instead of using gksudo. Never use sudo with GUI apps.
[23:02] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, i use sudo nautilus once
[23:02] <xangua> !phone | danny
[23:03] <ubottu> danny: Ubuntu for phone has been announced, see http://www.ubuntu.com/devices/phone to find out more and to sign up for progress updates. Discussion is in #ubuntu-phone
[23:03] <WeThePeople> used*
[23:03] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: You can fix it by either using ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a text terminal (ctrl+alt+F7 to get back) and fix the permissions, or reboot into recovery mode and fix the permissions.
[23:03] <wbf> Where is the Xorg.conf in ubuntu 12.10?
[23:04] <XDS2012> man i wish apple would act more like ubuntu sometimes
[23:04] <guntbert> WeThePeople: once is one too many
[23:04] <bekks> wbf: It does not exist by default.
[23:04] <usr13> WeThePeople: Why did you do it?  What did you do with nautilus as super user?
[23:04] <danny> xangua: not sure how that helped me or evan led me in the right direction to help myself i want to make a unity shortcut to my gmail
[23:04] <wbf> Well does it work?
[23:04] <wbf> when I put in an xorg in 12.10?
[23:04] <usr13> wbf: You mean /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
[23:04] <Jordan_U> wbf: If you create a /etc/X11/xorg.conf it will be used, yes. Why?
[23:04] <wbf> Yes.
[23:04] <bekks> wbf: If it is in the right place, sure.
[23:04] <wbf> Thank you.
[23:04] <WeThePeople> usr13, i forget it has to do with a selection gui of more programs
[23:05] <WeThePeople> guntbert, but then i used gksudo afterward again
[23:07] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, fix the permissions of nautilus?
[23:08] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: No, fix the permissions of ~/.ICEauthority .
[23:08] <frustrated> could anyone let me know why the program redshift doesn't work in ubuntu gnome3?
[23:08] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, it is fixed
[23:08] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, i have done that already
[23:09] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: Are you still having a problem logging in?
[23:09] <WeThePeople> it has rw capability and owned by super user
[23:09] <WeThePeople> yes
[23:09] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: It's not supposed to be owned by root, it's supposed to be owned by your user.
[23:09] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, ace:ace
[23:09] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: It's owned by root because you started a GUI application with sudo instead of gksudo.
[23:10] <WeThePeople> that is my user
[23:10] <WeThePeople> i did it correctly
[23:10] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: For future reference, "super user" is synonimous with "root".
[23:10] <WeThePeople> ok
[23:13] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: What happens now when you try to login?
[23:13] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, to my user account.. 1 moment pls
[23:17] <spiffman> hi, I tried to set up dual boot 32-bit and 64-bit ubuntu and now one constantly gives me "gave up waiting for root device" error and doesn't boot
[23:17] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, here is the msg exatly.. Could not update ICEauthority file /home/ace/.ICEauthority    <<<>>> and their is a Logout button too
[23:18] <spiffman> when i run blkid in busybox, the drive containing my ubuntu partitions doesn't show up...
[23:18] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Are the Ubuntu installations on different drives or on different partitions on the same drive?
[23:18] <spiffman> Jordan_U, different partitions of the same drive
[23:19] <schultza> on the server, how come the 'sudo apt-get upgrade' doesnt upgrade everything?
[23:19] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Can you pastebin the output of "sudo parted -l" and "sudo blkid" from the working install?
[23:19] <Jordan_U> !dist-upgrade | schultza
[23:19] <ubottu> schultza: A dist-upgrade will install new dependencies for packages already installed and may remove packages if they are no longer needed. This will not bring you to a new release of Ubuntu, see !upgrade if that is your intention.
[23:20] <spiffman> Jordan_U, sure, hold on a sec (using live usb)
[23:20] <rsser1> Jordan_U: ubuntu mobile
[23:20] <Jordan_U> spiffman: From the LiveUSB works just as well.

[23:27] <Kion1> I installed my msn account on empathy and now every 10 minutes I have a window saying some accound is asking for  permission to see when I connect, how do i get rid of that??
[23:27] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, these problems only have to do with ubuntu and ubuntu 2d. i am logged into flux box and have access to my user
[23:29] <Desproges> thanks again guntbert, I will check that in the coming days
[23:29] <bugtraq> klk
[23:29] <bugtraq> akuma
[23:30] <schultza> kion, i believe that is ppl asking you to add you to their contact list... and empathy likes to keep a local copy of your contacts, so i will do that for every contact
[23:30] <schultza> once approved for those contacts, empathy will stop asking
[23:31] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Which install is failing to boot, the 32 or 64 bit one?
[23:32] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: Just to be absolutely sure, what is the output of "ls -l ~/.ICEauthority"?
[23:34] <blackline> For the last couple of days I've tried to get the best solution for unpacking RAR archives with multiple files. I've gone through tons of forum threads and a couple of blogs. Most of them have recommended the Archiver included with Ubuntu in combination with unrar-nonfree. Many have stated that this will work. I've installed unrar-nonfree and it won't unpack the RAR archives I have that are divided and follows the pathern part01.rar, part0
[23:34] <blackline> 2.rar etc. Neither the once going .rar, .r01, etc. So, guys. What shoud I use to be able to extract at least all rar archives or in best case most archives?!
[23:34] <spiffman> Jordan_U, the 64 bit one, on /dev/sdb4
[23:34] <blackline> I'm trying Peazip now but i'm not very impressed at what I've seen yet.

[23:40] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, -rw------- 1 ace ace 1423 Jan  4 00:52 /home/ace/.ICEauthority
[23:40] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: The exact command I gave, "ls -l ~/.ICEauthority" , will cause ls to print the full path to the file.
[23:40] <olynch> Hello
[23:40] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, Yes I know how to do it in terminal but that's not very family friendly. I would like a gui.
[23:40] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: If you use something like pan it will do it for you.
=== matt_ is now known as Guest51928
[23:41] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, so isnt there anything comparable to winrar that can let me do all this in an interface?
[23:41] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: unrar doesn't have a gui.  Some utilities like ark might handle it but I doubt.  Be a man and use the cli.
[23:41] <alexhairyman> jhutchins_wk +1
[23:42] <spiffman> is there any way to instruct grub2 to use the root=/dev/sdx format instead of the default root=uuid=XXX-XXX format?
[23:42] <Jordan_U> WeThePeople: Very odd, I don't know why you're getting that error then.
[23:42] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Yes, but why do you want to do that? (it's less reliable)
[23:42] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, like most of the times i download like 10-15 episodes of something, extracting them all at the sime time at my desktop. they are all in different directories from start. I suppose I could use something to make this easy but it seems really unconvinient having to use terminal.
[23:43] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, what is this pan thingie then?
[23:43] <GeorgeJ> Hello folks!
[23:43] <WeThePeople> jordan_u, it might be a third party program, or since i have been messin around with mysql and postgres apache xammp maybe that might be why
[23:43] <spiffman> Jordan_U, looking on forums, it mentioned this as a possible solution. at this point, when i'm at the busybox boot, it doesn't even show the device
[23:43] <HackinBlack> Hello
[23:43] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, if i at least could get a right click context menu option for the unrar that would make a big difference.
[23:43] <Jordan_U> spiffman: No, that defninitely won't help you.
[23:43] <GeorgeJ> I've installed deluged and deluge-web, however, deluge-web doesn't seem to start at boot, so I've written an upstart job, as suggested on deluge-s page.
[23:44] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Can you pastebin the output of "sudo fsck /dev/sda4"?
[23:44] <HackinBlack> Hello
=== Celene is now known as Celene_away
[23:44] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Sorry, sdb4.
[23:44] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: You can extract them all in parallel.  I usually do it in the directories they're in then move the files.
[23:45] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: It's a function that a GUI would have a hard time with and a CLI does very well.
[23:45] <GeorgeJ> But for some reason, since deluged doesn't have an upstart job, deluge-web doesn't seem to be able to start when delgued starts. Here's my upstart job: http://tny.cz/19e0ab2a
[23:46] <GeorgeJ> Meh, I'll use ubuntu's paste, sorry
[23:46] <WeThePeople> how do i force a update of untrusted packages?

[23:46] <spiffman> Jordan_U, fsck: http://pastebin.com/3dDSnYHU
[23:46] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, so how would i proceeed doing this in terminal without having to browse through lets say 15 different folders?
[23:46] <Guest51928> hey can someone help me with my broadcom wifi drivers for macbook pro 13inch or lack there of i guess i need the drivers?
[23:47] <Jordan_U> spiffman: Can you mount it successfully with "sudo mount /dev/sdb4 /mnt/"?
[23:47] <blackline> sorry for being a pain in the ass but i see myself having to cd-browse through 10-20 folders a week unraring in compare to double click - extract, double click, extract.
[23:47] <GeorgeJ> Here's the paste: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1497681/ The file is located at /etc/init/deluge-web.conf. sudo service deluge-web start works. However, should deluge-web not start automatically when I do sudo service deluged start, because of the first line in the upstart job?

[23:50] <anonymous> Hm.
[23:50] <anonymous> So let me get this right.
[23:50] <anonymous> Nothing?
[23:51] <anonymous> Not even the normal BIOS boot display?
[23:51] <stijn> pardon?
[23:51] <dr_willis> Bios Messages -> grub menu -> Plymouth Splash -> Login screen.. :) where does it stop.
[23:51] <stijn> no, just black screen and noises thennit shutsdown in 5 sec
[23:52] <dr_willis> Hmm. Noises? like 3 or 5 beeps?
[23:52] <stijn> I turn on my laptop. I g
[23:52] <stijn> no, my cd drive i think
[23:53] <dr_willis> so the cd is clicking/looking for a disk. then the whole thing just powers down.
[23:53] <atlef> stijn, it seems you used wubi, maybe you should try to boot from the cd/usb to test it live first
[23:53] <stijn> I turn on my laptop. it gives me a black screen, no bar or text, no its not purple. shift doesnt work. then it shuts itself down 5sec later
[23:53] <stijn> yes i did
[23:54] <anonymous> I remember using Wubi as an Ubuntu noob...*shiver*.
[23:54] <anonymous> Never again.
[23:54] <Goldwing> exit
[23:54] <Goldwing> oops
[23:54] <anonymous> Abandon ship?
[23:54]  * anonymous waves
[23:54] <ikonia> anonymous: do you need/want something ?
[23:54] <dr_willis> A live cd does work?
[23:54] <jhutchins_wk> stijn: Bad RAM, bad hard disk, possibly bad video.
[23:54] <stijn> haha alright. ill try an usb tomorrow
[23:55] <anonymous> You can't try a USB unless you can get to the BIOS, as jhut says, it's probably a hardware failure.
[23:55] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, actually i just realized one thing when it comes to the extracting of rar files.
[23:55] <jhutchins_wk> stijn: stijn If you're not seeing the BIOS it's serious hardware.
[23:55] <anonymous> Coincidence, I'm causing...
[23:55] <stijn> did you see my post at askubuntu? http://askubuntu.com/questions/236330/laptop-wont-boot-at-all
[23:55] <anonymous> It just so happened to occur at this time, unrelated to Wubi, Wubi still sucks though.
[23:55] <stijn> I have an link to my laptops spec over there
[23:56] <anonymous> guessing*
[23:56] <jhutchins_wk> stijn: If there are any easy-to-access components you can try re-seating them, and pay attention to the sounds the HD makes when you turned it on.
[23:56] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, it seems the issue was never the File Roller+unrar-nonfree - The files I tried to unrar where on  a network drive but when I moved them locally to my hard drive there was no issue unraring them. Had the same issue with Peazip. So it's actually trying to unrar from the samba share that isn't working.
[23:56] <blami> jhutchins_wk: but still it would at least boot to bios screen even with broken hdd
[23:57] <blami> stijn: do you have ac connected to your laptop? (in case battery is dead)
[23:57] <stijn> I have, its fuly charged
[23:57] <blami> stijn: what kind of laptop is it?
[23:58] <stijn> my laptop http://support.acer.com/acerpanam/notebook/0000/Acer/Aspire5735Z/Aspire5735Zsp3.shtml
[23:58] <anonymous> Hm, try removing the battery, then booting without it.
[23:58] <anonymous> It's perfectly safe.
[23:58] <stijn> booting without the battery? lol
[23:59] <Transhumanist> You should unplug the battery when you're using mains and the battery is charged anyway
[23:59] <anonymous> Yep, I do it all the time.
[23:59] <stijn> lol ill try i guess. nothing to lose
[23:59] <Transhumanist> I think modern laptops have circuits to try and prevent battery overcharging, but it's easy and safest (in terms of minimising electricity consumption and battery degradation) to just use mains without the battery in.
