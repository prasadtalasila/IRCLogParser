[04:16] <davidkrauser> Hi everybody
[04:17] <davidkrauser> has anyone tried to build unity from source using these instructions lately? ( http://unity.ubuntu.com/getinvolved/development/unity/ )
[04:18] <davidkrauser> It seems there may be new changes in the NUX trunk that aren't working with the latest from unity.
[04:20] <davidkrauser> I opened a thread at the Ubuntu Forums about it: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2102641
[04:21] <davidkrauser> Just wondering if anyone knows of a specific version of NUX that is compatible, or if there's a work around?
[04:22] <davidkrauser> It also seems that the INSTALL file in the repo is VERY out of date (maybe years?).
[04:25] <davidkrauser> Anyways, if anyone has any suggestions I'd love to hear 'em. You can just post them in that forum thread. I may also post about this on the mailing list, just to see if I can get more ideas.
