[15:52] <Kilos> hi charl__ 
[15:52] <charl__> hi Kilos 
[15:52] <theblazehen-phon> Hi charl_
[15:52] <charl__> good afternoon/evening all
[15:52] <charl__> Maaz: coffee on
[15:52]  * Maaz washes some mugs
[15:53] <charl__> hi theblazehen-phon 
[15:53] <charl__> haven't been around for a while, been down with a cold, almost recovered from it now
[15:53] <charl__> how's it going?
[15:56] <Kilos> charl__, how does a cold affect your pc and fingers
[15:56] <charl__> Kilos: hehe :) i just didn't feel like doing much i guess
[15:56] <Maaz> Coffee's ready for charl__!
[15:56] <charl__> Maaz: thanks!
[15:57] <Maaz> charl__: Sure
[15:57] <Kilos> lol
[15:57] <Kilos> must been a bad cold
[15:57] <Kilos> you got a long tail
[15:57] <charl__> lol, yeah apparently one user is using charl and another charl_ so i got charl__
[15:57] <charl__> irssi does that automatically
[15:58] <Kilos> told you to register your nick
[15:58] <charl__> it just uses my unix username
[15:58] <Kilos> no one ever listens to me
[15:58] <charl__> it's interesting, somebody from south africa (i can see from the last known IP address) registered charl and haven't used it for 20 weeks
[15:58] <Kilos> they stole my bots nick as well
[15:58] <charl__> but freenode keeps all nickname registrations on
[15:59] <charl__> i don't care really, most of the networks i use don't even allow nickname registration
[15:59] <Kilos> ya they registered my bots nick as well
[15:59] <Kilos> swine
[15:59] <charl__> the person using charl currently (without identifying to nickserv) is a swede and charl_ is used by somebody behind a bnc
[16:00] <charl__> the benefit i have is i always irc from charl.eu so you know it's me regardless of the nickname :)
[16:00] <charl__> that was really the way irc was supposed to work in the first place
[16:00] <charl__> nickserv was a hack that was added in later
[16:00] <Kilos> oh ya
[16:01] <charl__> besides, like i said, most of the networks i use don't even have a nickserv
[16:01] <charl__> but you know which is me regardless of the network due to the hostname
[16:02] <charl__> hi zeref 
[16:02] <charl__> Kilos: so how have you been keeping?
[16:03] <Kilos> good ty charl installed server on other pc and been trying to learn iptables and ssh
[16:03] <charl__> nice
[16:03] <charl__> some powerful stuff, ssh and iptables
[16:03] <charl__> i am still amazed at how versatile ssh can be
[16:03] <Kilos> yip
[16:04] <charl__> iptables is also pretty powerful
[16:04] <charl__> especially when you start with nat routing and such
[16:04] <Kilos> actually very lekker using ssh
[16:04] <Kilos> just would like to see a gui there now and again
[16:04] <charl__> a long time ago i used to play with radvd and stuff for ipv6, which replaces nat routing
[16:04] <charl__> also quite good entertainment
[16:05] <Kilos> whenever i try something new all the guys sigh  and hide
[16:06] <charl__> i am watching a video about a dutch guy who collects old gaming consoles, he has an amazing collection already
[16:06] <charl__> http://tweakers.net/video/6995/gathering-of-the-tweakers-consoleverzamelaar-jva18.html
[16:08] <charl__> heh he has stuff i didn't even knew existed :D
[16:17] <Kilos> im watching the sardine runs in sa
[16:17] <Kilos> on tv3 
[16:26] <Kilos> one of natures great events its classed as

[16:35] <Symmetria> yes, the guest house Im staying in uses it :(
[16:36] <Symmetria> hahahahahahaha omg my dad is pissed at me, this company was sending him emails in formats he couldnt open
[16:36] <Symmetria> so he told them to send it to me but didnt tell me I'd be getting shit from them
[16:36] <Symmetria> so I got spam from them as far as I was concerned
[16:36] <Symmetria> so I sent back this really snotty reply that said "Don't spam me, its illegal under the ECT act, you're south african, and I'll nail your spamming ass to the wall"
[16:36] <Symmetria> ;p
[16:36] <Symmetria> ROTFL
[16:37]  * Symmetria thinks its very funny
[16:45] <Mezenir> disowned
[16:49] <Symmetria> hahaha then my dad sends me an email zomg, they are saying you verbally abused them, how can you be so nasty, blah blah blah
[16:49] <Symmetria> Im like, thats what happens when I get b.s 
[17:25] <charl__> nn all

[19:29] <inetpro> "When VW dropped the iconic CitiGolf from its line-up in 2010, the company’s marketing bigwigs ingeniously replaced it with a rehashed fourth-generation Polo dubbed Polo Vivo"
[19:29] <inetpro> http://topcar.co.za/road-tests/comparisons/toyota-etios-vs-rivals/
[19:29] <Kilos> used to be a matter of pride with them
[19:30] <inetpro> VERDICT: "...the Ford Figo wins. Yes, it’s the cheapest car in this company but it’s also the most versatile, covering all key areas with aplomb."
