[16:21] <thafreak> I think I've been AFK since last year...
[16:21] <paultag> hahaha
[16:21] <paultag> so much bru
[16:21] <thafreak> really?
[16:22] <thafreak> or has everyone been afk
[16:22] <paultag> yeah, we talked a bit about pittsburgese yesterday (me and dzho) but that's it
[16:23] <thafreak> backlog doesn't show much since before christmas
[16:24] <thafreak> kinda figured it'd be dead...i mean since I wasn't around to talk to
[16:24] <paultag>  true
[16:24]  * thafreak is running fluxbox in vnc 
[16:24] <thafreak> need to run some stuff on my work computer
[16:25] <paultag> :D
[16:25] <thafreak> opened my work email...
[16:25] <thafreak> got an email from a recruiter
[16:26] <thafreak> for a job...doing .Net...
[16:26] <paultag> eeeerryyy day
[16:26] <thafreak> in columbus
[16:26] <thafreak> couldn't have been a worse fit for me, unless it required moving out of state
[16:26] <paultag> hahahaha
[16:27] <thafreak> debating on how/if to respond
[16:27] <paultag> I just ignore 99.9% of them
[16:27] <paultag> unless I care, then I say not now, but I'll keep you in mind
[16:27] <thafreak> so annoying though...they always say...i was looking at your resume...
[16:27] <paultag> I took my resume off the net for now
[16:28] <thafreak> really...i think if you were looking at MY resume, you wouldn't be bothering me
[16:28] <thafreak> yeah...so did I
[16:28] <thafreak> I think these people pass around 8 year old version of my resume or something
[16:28] <thafreak> where I had vb6 listed...cause I took a vb class 10 years ago and figured I'd put it on my resume then
[16:29] <thafreak> now I regret it
[16:30] <paultag> hahahaha
[16:34] <thafreak> here was my response: http://pastebin.com/WYuTAN2N
[16:34] <thafreak> too harsh?
[16:37] <paultag> zing
[16:37] <paultag> yeah, that's a bit hard, but it's OK
[16:41] <thafreak> meh, they're so lazy, they deserve a kick in the pants
[16:42] <thafreak> i actually saw a new website last night...they're a new startup
[16:42] <thafreak> and they're looking for python devs i think in cbus
[16:42] <thafreak> and the website is for recruiters actually
[16:42] <thafreak> was thinking about maybe signing up and trying my hand at recruiting
[16:43] <paultag> you should try!
[16:43] <thafreak> everything that pisses me off..I tend to think I can do it better myself
[16:44] <thafreak> this is a fundamental character flaw I beleive
[16:46] <paultag> aye
