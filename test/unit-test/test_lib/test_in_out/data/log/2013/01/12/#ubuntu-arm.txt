[11:44] <cukkimo> Hello!
[11:45] <cukkimo> I've ran into some problems with my pandaboard when running ubuntu-arm 12.04. Random green pixel "noise" in the screen as well with vertical lines and monitor going out of range when under graphical load
[11:47] <cukkimo> Jockey cant install proprietary drivers
[11:48] <cukkimo> I've done dist-upgrade with tiomap/release repo and ubuntu arm repos, yet still the problem persists
[12:11] <cukkimo_> Anyone?
[12:13] <Tassadar> nah, just 150 people idling)
[12:21] <cukkimo_> As I did kinda suspect that...  :D
[12:21] <cukkimo_> WARNING: /sys/module/omapdrm_pvr/drivers does not exist, cannot rebind omapdrm_pvr driver
[12:22] <cukkimo_> Might this be the problem, it's from the jockey.log

[13:56] <cukkimo> What version of ubuntu is more likely to run perfectly on pandaboard? Im thinkin of installin ubuntu-core 12.10 as it could be more advanced for ARM devices since the new launch. Am I even remotely on the right path?
[19:37] <mjrosenb> well, this is strange.  I'm looking at the directions for building a raspberry pi cross compiler
[19:37] <mjrosenb> and I don't see it doing anything different from a normal cross compiler build.
[19:38] <SmallFry> why is tha strage?
[19:38] <SmallFry> it's just a cross compiler
[19:39] <mjrosenb> because the standard cross compiler doesn't work.
[19:39] <SmallFry> oh
[19:39] <SmallFry> herm
[19:39] <SmallFry> idk then, sorry
[19:39] <mjrosenb> namely, it seems to insert snippets of thumb2 code
[19:39] <mjrosenb> when in fact that doesn't exist
[19:40] <armin76> mjrosenb: on ubuntu the default configuration options for gcc enable thumb2 code, iirc
[19:41] <mjrosenb> armin76: iirc, I built with -march=armv6
[19:41] <mjrosenb> I don't think I added -marm
[19:44] <suihkulokki> mjrosenb: the compiler will include bits from libgcc et all, which have thumb2/armv7 cide
[19:44] <suihkulokki> cide..code
[20:00] <mjrosenb> suihkulokki: right, so how does building an arm compiler with crosstool-ng and not putting anything armv6 specific in it prevent this from happening?
[20:00] <mjrosenb> oh, or does it default to something ancient like armv4t
