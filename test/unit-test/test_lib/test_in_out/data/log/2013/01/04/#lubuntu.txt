[01:25] <Noskcaj> why is lubuntu the only ubuntu distro that doesn't have separate volume controlls for headphones and inbuilt speakers?
[02:25] <holstein> Noskcaj: AFAIK, its the one that isnt using pulse audio
[02:26] <holstein> Noskcaj: you are welcome to install it.. or maybe one of the other distros might be a better out-of-the-box fit for your needs
[02:28] <holstein> Noskcaj: i added pulse audio to lubuntu, tested something, and removed it.. not too challenging at all
[02:29] <Noskcaj> holstein, thanks for the info. i am considering swapping back to xubuntu but i have 30gb of movies to watch that i don't want to delete and i just put in heaps of themes an hour ago
[02:31] <holstein> ?
[02:31] <holstein> Noskcaj: xubuntu *is* ubuntu.. just as lubuntu is
[02:32] <holstein> if you have lubuntu, just install XFCE or the xubuntu-desktop metapackage
[02:33] <holstein> !purexfce
[02:33] <ubottu> If you want to remove all !KDE and !Gnome packages and have a default !Xubuntu system follow the instructions here « http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfce »
[02:33] <holstein> !purelxde
[02:33] <ubottu> If you want to remove all !KDE, !GNOME and !XFCE packages and have a default !Lubuntu system follow the instructions here « http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purelxde »
[02:49] <Noskcaj> holstein, thanks for the links, when i get back from my holiday i think i will change

[14:41] <SonikkuAmerica> Hey, quick question: (12.10) How do I change the print size of items on the screen (readability)?
[14:55] <Ploozi> Has anyone had the error, "Failed to execute child process "lubuntu-logout" (No such file or directory)" while attempting to log out?
[15:37] <jerli> hi...
[15:46] <bennypr0fane> hello, does anyone know how to change audio hardware settings in Lubuntu 12.04? Specifically, I want to set my bluetooth headphones as output device. You can see my issue here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2042456 there haven't been any replies to it in months
[15:46] <bennypr0fane> however, I cna't even find where to access audio settings in the first place...
[16:19] <holstein> bennypr0fane: i might consider using pulse audio
[16:19] <holstein> bennypr0fane: i might fire up xubuntu live or main ubuntu and test and see if using pulse simplifies your situtaion
[16:19] <bennypr0fane> holstein is there gui for it?
[16:20] <holstein> bennypr0fane: pavucontrol is nice
[16:20] <holstein> otherwise, you should just start a bluetooth manager, and make sure the bluetooth is connected
[16:21] <bennypr0fane> it is, i made sure
[16:21] <bennypr0fane> the connection is up, but no sound in the headphones
[16:21] <holstein> also, there are audio settings in alsa mixer
[16:21] <holstein> alsamixer in the terminal
[16:22] <holstein> whenever i am doing more than just a simple setup, i use pulse
[16:22] <holstein> or, im using JACK and i dont care about system sounds at all
[16:23] <bennypr0fane> In alsmixer I can't find how to set the output device
[16:23] <bennypr0fane> installed pulse audio. of course (sorry, Lubuntu) there isn't a starter for it in the menu
[16:24] <holstein> bennypr0fane: a starter?
[16:24] <holstein> bennypr0fane: lubuntu doesnt ship with pulse, so there wont be a "starter"
[16:24] <holstein> bennypr0fane: if you have pulse installed, and configured properly, install pavucontrol
[16:24] <bennypr0fane> done
[16:25] <bennypr0fane> I mean a menu entry to click on in order to access pulse aduio
[16:25] <bennypr0fane> there isn't one for pavucontrol either
[16:25] <holstein> bennypr0fane: ?
[16:25] <holstein> bennypr0fane: there wont be any menu item for pulse
[16:25] <holstein> bennypr0fane: there never is
[16:26] <holstein> bennypr0fane: you can start pavucontrol from the terminal and test
[16:26] <bennypr0fane> oh, wait, there it is. just not titled pavucontrol
[16:26] <holstein> should be pulse audio volume control in the menu somewhere
[16:26] <bennypr0fane> it's called pulse audio volume control
[16:26] <bennypr0fane> yes
[16:26] <holstein> sure.. and you can start it either way you like
[16:27] <holstein> but i would test its functionality, then bother with if you need it around or not, and how to launch it
[16:27] <bennypr0fane> ok
[16:28] <bennypr0fane> well the headset is not listed as an output device in pavucontrol
[16:29] <holstein> bennypr0fane: then i argue its connectivitiy
[16:29] <bennypr0fane> conectivity of what?
[16:29] <holstein> bennypr0fane: make certain some bluetooth manager is using/seeing it
[16:29] <holstein> bennypr0fane: the headphones that are not presenting them selves in pulse
[16:29] <bennypr0fane> yes, blueman sees the connection up
[16:30] <holstein> bennypr0fane: i would test with something like skype
[16:30] <holstein> bennypr0fane: i would try with a live cd of something running pluse
[16:30] <holstein> pulse*
[16:31] <bennypr0fane> test what eaxaclty?
[16:32] <bennypr0fane> i don't care whether the mic works, my main concern is for the sound to got to the headset, not audio card
[16:32] <bennypr0fane> which it doesn't right now
[16:32] <holstein> bennypr0fane: test the device with pulse audio in a system that has shipped pulse and is configured properly
[16:32] <bennypr0fane> maybe it's about the bt services
[16:32] <holstein> bennypr0fane: otherwise, you are troubleshooting multiple things at once right now
[16:32] <bennypr0fane> does ubuntu ship with puplse?
[16:32] <holstein> bennypr0fane: AFAIK, lubuntu ships without it
[16:33] <holstein> otherwise, xubuntu ships with it, and ubuntu.. as i suggested trying live CD's for above
[16:33] <bennypr0fane> because it works there,  on another conmputer though, laptop /w bt built in
[16:34] <bennypr0fane> debian on this machine doesn't even see my bt adpater
[16:34] <bennypr0fane> so does it say anything useful if the headset works in Ubuntu on another pc? or should I test with ubuntu on this one?
[16:36] <holstein> bennypr0fane: it says that it works with pulse in ubuntu
[16:37] <holstein> bennypr0fane: if it does... id sayd that means it *can* work with lubuntu then, since lubuntu *is* ubuntu
[16:37] <bennypr0fane> then no need to test with an ubuntu cd, yes?
[16:37] <bennypr0fane> just need to figure out how to make pulse see the device
[16:38] <bennypr0fane> right?
[16:39] <bennypr0fane> right now, I got 2 services connected: headset and audio sink. is one of them a2dp? because I think that's the service I need to connect
[16:40] <holstein> when you say bt built in.. if you have a bt dongle, i might troubleshoot is seperately
[16:41] <bennypr0fane> good idea, how can I go about that?
[16:41] <bennypr0fane> there is nothing about my adapter in blueman
[16:41] <holstein> i would try a known good bt device
[16:42] <holstein> i would try removing variables
[16:42] <holstein> i would try a live CD on the integrated bt hardware.. see that you get that headset and all that working
[16:42] <bennypr0fane> I'm actually surprised it works, because I can't find anything in system.
[16:42] <holstein> move to the other rig, and replicate the procedure...
[16:43] <bennypr0fane> I don't have any other bt device that works with this pc. I do have an older bt dongle with 2.0, and it displays the very same issues
[16:44] <bennypr0fane> you mean a live cd of Lubuntu, in that case?
[16:45] <bennypr0fane> I actually have Lubuntu installed  as well on the laptop (the one with built-in bt chip)
[16:45] <holstein> bennypr0fane: i was suggeting the headset.. i suggest a live CD since it removes the user config
[16:45] <bennypr0fane> well I don'T have another bt headset either...
[16:45] <holstein> you load a xubuntu live CD on the hardware that was working with the headset.. test.. repeat that *exact* same procedure on the other machine
[16:45] <holstein> the only change is the BT adapter
[16:45] <bennypr0fane> why xubuntu?
[16:46] <holstein> bennypr0fane: some live CD with pulse
[16:46] <bennypr0fane> sorry, not following :-(
[16:46] <holstein> bennypr0fane: use what you want
[16:46] <holstein> Daviey: dont do anything im suggesting
[16:46] <holstein> Daviey: sorry
[16:46] <holstein> bennypr0fane: ^^
[16:46] <bennypr0fane> ok, which pc, which bt chip, which external hw?
[16:46] <holstein> bennypr0fane: bot
[16:46] <holstein> boht*
[16:46] <holstein> bennypr0fane: both*
[16:46] <holstein> bennypr0fane: change only the bt adapter
[16:47] <holstein> bennypr0fane: test on the machine that you said it worked with.. test with a live CD that you can boot on the other machine that is *not* working
[16:47] <bennypr0fane> well, like i said, the other adapter has the same problem
[16:47] <holstein> if you do everything the same, then the adapter is likey the issue
[16:47] <holstein> in which case, you can stop looking in audio settings as its not an audio issue
[16:48] <bennypr0fane> ah, you mean put the adapter into the other machine
[16:48] <holstein> bennypr0fane: do whatever you feel will isolate that hardware
[16:48] <bennypr0fane> the adapter
[16:48] <holstein> bennypr0fane: i would run a live CD on the machine that has the itegreated BT hardware.. i would boot that.. test the headset.. see that it works
[16:48] <holstein> THEN, i would repeat that *exaxt* same thing on the other box
[16:48] <bennypr0fane> yes it does
[16:49] <bennypr0fane> oh, but not tested on live CD, just installed system
[16:49] <holstein> because, due to the above test, the headset shoud work
[16:49] <holstein> bennypr0fane: i like the live CD since that is less changes
[16:49] <bennypr0fane> I still don't get why the live cd is nevess
[16:49] <bennypr0fane> *scratch that
[16:49] <holstein> bennypr0fane: its not.. its just isolating points of failure
[16:50] <bennypr0fane> "fewer changes"... :-)
[16:50] <holstein> bennypr0fane: what if the machine with the integrated BT hardware is configured properly?
[16:50] <bennypr0fane> I see
[16:50] <holstein> bennypr0fane: what if the pulse on the other one is not configureed?
[16:50] <holstein> is it different bluetooth GUIs?
[16:50] <bennypr0fane> yes
[16:50] <bennypr0fane> that one is gnome, this one is lxde
[16:50] <holstein> i would remove *all* of these questions.. test witn one OS... the same live CD OS
[16:51] <holstein> if its gnome from 10.04, that would be relevant.. that is a different kernel
[16:51] <bennypr0fane> no, Gnome from 12.04. when you say hardware, please say exactly which one you mean, bcs hardware can mean pretty much any device
[16:52] <holstein> that is likely a point of failure.. an older kernel that supports the BT usb dongle.. and the newer lubuntu 12.x kernel not supporing
[16:52] <holstein> bennypr0fane: the BT dongle..
[16:52] <holstein> bennypr0fane: what isnt working? is it the headset? or the dongle?
[16:52] <holstein> bennypr0fane: is the dongle capable or working with linux?
[16:52] <holstein> bennypr0fane: that is what you havent dont
[16:52] <holstein> done*
[16:53] <holstein> and right now, you are testing 3 other variables and that at eh same time (at least)
[16:54] <holstein> is its LXDE? is the the bluetooth software in lubuntu? is it pulse audio? is it gnome? is the the kernel version?
[16:54] <holstein> minimize the variables and isolate the bt hardware
[16:55] <bennypr0fane> ok, I need to isolate the dongle. that means I need to test it a) on a different pc with b) a different audio and c) a different headset, right? but i don't have c) ! I just know that this headset does work on the other pc with Ubuntu, and with Windows
[16:56] <holstein> i wouldnt use windows for anything other than "is the headset broken"
[16:56] <holstein> the drivers are different and it doesnt help
[16:58] <holstein> what i would do: boot the machine with the integrated BT with the headset and a live CD... *if* that headset works fine on that hardare with that live cd, then...
[16:58] <bennypr0fane> If I test this headset with the same OS, the same audio (Pulse), but a different bt hardware (built-in chip), than it's proof that the donlge is the culprit, right?
[16:58] <holstein> take that same live CD to the hardware you have now, and test
[16:58] <holstein> if the headset is not working then the big relevant change is the BT dongle
[16:59] <holstein> i think this would be good evidence that its the dongle...
[16:59] <bennypr0fane> ok
[16:59] <bennypr0fane> BUT
[16:59] <bennypr0fane> lemme think...
[17:01] <bennypr0fane> what if I use a live USB of Lubuntu, install Pulse Audio and then try the same thing? wouldn't that be even better (bcs it's closer to my setup here) than using a live CD of another distro that ships with pulse?
[17:02] <bennypr0fane> ah, you mean if the distro ships with pulse, that would exclude errors in LXDE/Lubuntu?
[17:03] <holstein> bennypr0fane: whatever you feel will isolate the dongle
[17:03] <holstein> bennypr0fane: trying lubuntu live on the hardare with integrated BT would be a good relevant test as well
[17:05] <bennypr0fane> ok, I may be getting the picture... stupid dongle. the manufacturer doesn't even offer linux drivers for download. That's why I wonder how Lubuntu made it work/find the driver. You got any explanation for that?
[17:06] <holstein> bennypr0fane: the ubuntu kernels tries to support what it can
[17:08] <bennypr0fane> yes but how, if there isn' a driver?
[17:09] <bennypr0fane> do you happen to know if +buntu live images have an integrated bootloader?
[17:09] <holstein> bennypr0fane: sure, there is something that boots the live instance
[17:09] <bennypr0fane> good
[17:09] <holstein> bennypr0fane: there are drivers in the kernel for what is supportable
[17:10] <holstein> doesnt mean they are good or work with all hardware
[17:10] <bennypr0fane> cause i recently came across a distro that gives non-bootable images
[17:10] <TheLordOfTime> like Debian?  :P
[17:10] <bennypr0fane> no
[17:10] <TheLordOfTime> nah, i kid, there's a lot of non-live-image distros out there
[17:10] <bennypr0fane> elive
[17:11] <bennypr0fane> I didn't know that
[17:11] <bennypr0fane> Debian must be using a different kernel then, bcs it can't see this bt dongle
[17:14] <bennypr0fane> ok gotta go, thank you holstein
[17:14] <holstein> bennypr0fane: good luck..

[19:30] <Bor3y> how to change themes in lubuntu ?
[19:31] <Moewe> LXAppearance
[19:31] <Moewe> do u tried that?
[19:31] <Noskcaj> bot3y, prefernences > customise look and feel
[19:32] <Moewe> Noskcaj, i think these ist lxappearance, isnit?
[19:33] <Noskcaj> yes, it is. just how he gets to it
[19:33] <Moewe> ok
[19:33] <Noskcaj> Bor3y, some good ideas for themes https://www.facebook.com/groups/lubuntu.official/
[19:33] <Moewe> my lubuntu is german
[19:33] <Moewe> so i cant say the way ;)
[19:34] <Bor3y> yes thank you i changed it :)
[19:34] <Bor3y> it's my first time use lubuntu , i want to know whats the different between lubuntu and ubuntu and kubuntu ?>
[19:35] <Noskcaj> !lxde
[19:35] <holstein> lubuntu *is* ubuntu.. they all use the same repos.. they are all built on the ubuntu core, and share kernels

[19:35] <Moewe> a lots of programms releated to the use, look and feel :P
[19:35] <holstein> lubuntu is ubuntu with LXDE.. kubuntu with KDE.. etc.. the default config is the basic difference
[19:36] <Noskcaj> exactly
[19:36] <holstein> if you install lxde in ubuntu, are you running lubuntu? not really.. but more that is kind of how you get to lubuntu from ubuntu
[19:37] <holstein> nothing pulls in interest like a wall of facts ;)
