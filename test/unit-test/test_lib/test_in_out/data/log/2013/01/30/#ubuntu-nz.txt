[02:06] <hads> morning
[02:08] <ibeardslee> pushing it!
[02:16] <hads> Maybe if I was in Perth :)
[02:16] <hads> Which is my pick for LCA2014 by the way.
[02:21] <ibeardslee> that's a big leap across the ditch.
[02:21] <ibeardslee> I'd fly to sydney and spend some time doing a train trip across australia
[02:22]  * ajmitch is still waiting for LCA auckland
[02:26] <hads> ibeardslee: I'd love to take the train across one day, however I don't think I'd have a week to spare at the moment.
[02:26] <hads> Yeah LCA AKL would be interesting. Perhaps 2015? It's been a little while since WNG now.
[02:27] <ibeardslee> hads: that's ok, you have a year to clear the decks to be able to do that ;)
[02:27] <ajmitch> requires a dedicated team of people to put together a bid, I don't know if there was work in progress on that or not
[02:28] <hads> For sure, all just random speculation on my part.
[02:29] <hads> ibeardslee: Maybe, I believe this is the year I will need to succumb and actually employ someone.
[02:31] <ajmitch> big step
[02:32] <hads> Yeah. I've been actively avoiding it for a couple of years but I don't think that's possible any longer.
[02:42] <G> hads: who are the contenders for LCA14?
[02:49] <hads> G: No idea
[02:50] <hads> It will be announced on Friday afternoon I guess.
[03:49] <elky> If perth actually put in a bid, I suspect they'll be the pick.
