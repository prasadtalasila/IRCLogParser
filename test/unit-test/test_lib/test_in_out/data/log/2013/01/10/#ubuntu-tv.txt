[02:20] <dcope> is there any remote support yet?
[02:24] <dcope> bobweaver: nice
[02:24] <dcope> bobweaver: btw, are you the lead on this?
[02:27] <tgm4883> dcope, bobweaver isn't here right now, so he can't see your messages
[02:27] <tgm4883> but yes, he is the lead on the unity work being done
[02:28] <dcope> ah
[02:28] <dcope> cool
[02:29] <dcope> tgm4883: how stable is the build from the wiki?
[02:29] <tgm4883> dcope, IDK, the best to run is probably from the PPA
[02:30] <dcope> ah
[02:30] <dcope> cool, i'll just install that one that bobweaver linked me to
[02:30] <tgm4883> ok
[02:31] <dcope> bunch of parts came in, about ready to build this htpc.. probably this weekend.
