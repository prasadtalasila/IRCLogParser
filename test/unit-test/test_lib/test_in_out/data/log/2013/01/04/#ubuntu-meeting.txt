[18:03] <tgm4883> well we should probably get started
[18:03] <tgm4883> !help
[18:03] <ubottu> Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[18:03] <tgm4883> hmm
[18:03] <tgm4883> !meeting
[18:03] <ubottu> Team meetings are held in #ubuntu-meeting - See « /msg ubottu logs » for transcripts.

[18:05] <tgm4883> Note that there is nothing on the agenda
[18:06] <CrestedNewt> is BobWeaver in? I don't see him
[18:06] <tgm4883> we pinged him, but I didn't see him around
[18:06] <tgm4883> Since there is nothing on the agenda, I'll open the floor to anyone that has anything to say and/or questions or comments

[18:07] <mhall119> so, given the holidays since our last meeting, there probably isn't anything new to discuss
[18:07] <tgm4883> mhall119, my guess as well
[18:07] <CrestedNewt> Do we know the current status of development?
[18:07] <CrestedNewt> ie - where are we?
[18:08] <mhall119> except, well, omg! Phone!
[18:08] <tgm4883> CrestedNewt, I'm not aware of the current status of the non-mythtv parts
[18:08] <CrestedNewt> Ubuntu Phone is to be discussed later :D
[18:08] <mhall119> CrestedNewt: I know bobweaver has been experimenting with different things on the old unity2d code
=== Tonio__ is now known as Tonio_aw
[18:08] <mhall119> I don't know if anything new has been done on the unity 3d port
[18:09] <CrestedNewt> OK, just so that I get this right .....
[18:09] <mhall119> tgm4883: how is the MythTV scope work going?
[18:09] <CrestedNewt> Bobweaver is working on the old 2D platform
[18:09] <mhall119> CrestedNewt: he's been working on both
[18:09] <CrestedNewt> and he is hoping to have a stable platform with which to move forwards?
[18:09] <mhall119> he's been porting to Unity 3d, but still using the 2d code for prototyping
[18:10] <tgm4883> The main scope is great. Playback of content works nicely and looks good
[18:10] <tgm4883> the guide data parts though....
[18:10] <mhall119> CrestedNewt: that's the goal, yes
[18:10] <CrestedNewt> mhall119 - ok that's good news
[18:10] <mhall119> tgm4883: the main scopes searches already recorded stuff?
[18:11] <tgm4883> Currently I'm seeing if upstream will add some stuff to the API so I don't have to do a query on each show just to get description
[18:11] <tgm4883> mhall119, yes, that part works great
[18:11] <mhall119> tgm4883: you can always just use the title in the search results, and only query for the description if they open it in a preview
[18:12] <tgm4883> I need to move the servicesapi.py file to it's own package though so I can separate the guide and playback scopes
[18:12] <tgm4883> mhall119, yea that is what I have it doing now, but then you can only search title/subtitle
[18:12] <mhall119> tgm4883: cool
[18:13] <tgm4883> But I'm not adding description back in unless I can get it to a reasonable run time
[18:13] <mhall119> tgm4883: maybe you can put a bit in the next blog post about your progress and how people can help you with it
[18:13] <tgm4883> #action tgm4883
[18:13] <meetingology> ACTION: tgm4883
[18:13] <mhall119> any screenshot of the TV UI, even the old 2d one, showing results from MythTV would cause some excitement too
[18:14] <tgm4883> yea I need to work with bobweaver to get a TV UI setup for that
[18:14] <tgm4883> or have him do a couple screenshots
[18:15] <mhall119> Any ideas on what we can do with the new phone & SDK to capitalize on some of that buzz for the TV?
[18:16]  * tgm4883 shrugs
[18:16] <tgm4883> I haven't looked at phone much
[18:16] <mhall119> it's pretty cool, and the SDK is something that people should use to write TV apps too
[18:17] <mhall119> I'll talk to bobweaver about maybe getting some screenshots of the example app running on the TV UI, see if it's worth talking about
[18:18] <tgm4883> it's QML, so bobweaver should be happy
[18:18] <CrestedNewt> OK, in the UK atm there is a push on http://www.youview.com/features/ and http://go.sky.com/vod/page/tvListing.do
[18:18] <mhall119> yeah, he's already been in #ubuntu-phone
[18:19] <CrestedNewt> the sky solution allows video on the move .... but it requires silverlight
[18:19] <mhall119> tgm4883: your guide scope, is that using MythTV as it's backend?
[18:20] <tgm4883> mhall119, yes
[18:20] <mhall119> and can MythTV use the sources CrestedNewt just mentioned?
[18:21] <tgm4883> mhall119, err, it's not like that
[18:21] <tgm4883> mhall119, so you can think of mythtv similar to how we're thinking about ubuntu tv (or vice versa). Mythtv has a backend and a frontend (in the case of Ubuntu TV, we're basically just making a UTV a frontend)
[18:22] <tgm4883> any online sources and such that mythtv could use, would be mythtv frontend plugins
[18:22] <tgm4883> which don't make sense here, we'd just make them unity scopes
[18:22] <tgm4883> unless i'm not understanding what these things are
[18:23] <mhall119> oh, ok, so tv guides aren't being stored in the backend?
[18:23] <CrestedNewt> both of the sites I posted are 'historical' VOD services.... I was just thinking about the tie in with ubuntu_phone
[18:23] <tgm4883> yes, the tv guide is stored in the backend, but this looks to be more than just a tv guide
[18:24] <mhall119> oh, ok
[18:24] <CrestedNewt> no probs - I just thought that I would clear that up :D
[18:24] <mhall119> I was mostly interested in just the tv guide data, if MythTV can support multiple sources, then we only need a single source to get it out of MythTV
[18:24] <mhall119> makes our job easier that way
[18:25] <tgm4883> mhall119, you should get guide data from the same place that you are scheduling recordings
[18:25] <tgm4883> so in this case, mythtv
[18:26] <tgm4883> mythtv supports schedules direct and XMLTV I think
[18:26] <mhall119> ok
[18:26] <tgm4883> well, and EPG
[18:26] <tgm4883> but that sucks in the US
[18:27] <tgm4883> so with mythtv, you can have multiple sources, and you might have a different set of guide data for each source (which is why I say tie the two together)
[18:28] <tgm4883> from the UTV POV, the only source if mythtv (and mythtv figures out all the other important stuff)
[18:29] <mhall119> sounds good to me
[18:29] <tgm4883> yea the more I look at youview, the more it sounds like it should be a scope
[18:30] <CrestedNewt> OK, blue sky stuff here for future discussion but I think that it needs to be noted somewhere..... Sky offer this planner http://tv.sky.com/tv-guide#/day/0 and you can then decide to record from this service as well as getting more programme information. The record function is only available if you are a Sky subscriber. DO NOTHING WITH THIS YET but views for later on would be good.
[18:31] <mhall119> CrestedNewt: where does that record it to? your local hardware, or something on their network?
[18:31] <CrestedNewt> sends a signal through satellite to your box which has a viewing card. These are linked to your username
[18:32] <mhall119> ah, ok
[18:32] <tgm4883> looks like there is a sky DVR box too
[18:32] <tgm4883> with storage
[18:33] <CrestedNewt> yes - the top of range box has 1080i output and a 1 TB HDD
[18:35] <mhall119> alright, any other topics to discuss?
[18:35] <tgm4883> I've got none
[18:35] <CrestedNewt> I have none - other than I need to get something to document :D
[18:36] <mhall119> alright, I'll try and get some information from Canonical's side about how the new Phone stuff might be impacting the TV, and vice-versa, to see how it all should fit together
[18:36] <mhall119> and we'll get with bobweaver when he's online for some screenshots and stuff
[18:36] <tgm4883> sounds good
[18:36] <CrestedNewt> mhall119 - good man!!
[18:36] <mhall119> alright, thanks guys!
