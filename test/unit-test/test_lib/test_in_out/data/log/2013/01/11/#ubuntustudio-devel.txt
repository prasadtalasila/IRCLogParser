[09:04] <ttoine> hello
[09:29] <zequence> ttoine: Hi
[10:13] <ttoine> zequence, did you see the invitation for the ubuntu council ?
[11:01] <zequence> ttoine: No
[11:04] <zequence> ttoine: Who, when where? :)
[11:05] <astraljava> zequence: What's your email? I can fwd it.
[11:05] <astraljava> Er... no need, there are archives. :D
[11:06] <astraljava> zequence: https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-studio-devel/2013-January/004831.html
[11:08] <zequence> Ah, I really need to see over my mail routines. I seem to miss stuff that I'm not expecting
[11:08] <zequence> The expected mail, no problem at all
[11:08] <zequence> astraljava: Thanks
[11:09] <zequence> I'll be able to attend, so I'll be there
[11:20] <astraljava> I'll see about it as well.
[11:22] <astraljava> Ugh... didn't realize it's on Thursday. Can't make it, then.
[11:37] <zequence> astraljava: Is that your squash game day?
[11:38] <astraljava> Nope, and it's badminton actually. :) Thu is my choir practice.
[12:18] <ttoine> zequence, on the mailing list
[12:19] <ttoine> oh, astraljava was quicker
[13:35] <ttoine> zequence, I just finished some comparative tests with the same session in Mixbus, on Ubuntu Studio desktop, Unity, Gnome Classic with effects and Gnome classic without effects
[13:35] <ttoine> Mixbus uses Cairo, and it uses too much cpu when compositing is enabled
[13:35] <ttoine> Unity: up to 100% cpu and so, xruns
[13:36] <ttoine> Ubuntu Studio with compositing: 51%
[13:36] <ttoine> Ubuntu Studio without compositing: 45%
[13:36] <ttoine> Gnome classic with effects: 70%
[13:36] <ttoine> Gnome classis without effetcs: 35%
[13:41] <zequence> ttoine: That's pretty huge differences
[13:41] <zequence> Len-nb: Seems like David got the PA jackd bug fixed :)
[13:41] <zequence> ttoine: You didn't try gnome-shell?
[13:54] <ttoine> zequence, No I didn't, but you are right, I have to test that
[13:55] <ttoine> zequence, by the way, the Unity team leader is living in my area, I think I will talk with him about that
[13:57] <ttoine> compiz is definitely "fat"
[14:05] <zequence> ttoine: Isn't there a 2d version too?
[14:06] <ttoine> of unity ?
[14:06] <zequence> Yes
[14:06] <zequence> Used to be, at least
[14:06] <ttoine> perhaps in 12.04, but not anymore on 12.10
[14:06] <zequence> Ah
[14:06] <zequence> Yeah, I can find it on this machine. THis is 12.04
[14:06] <zequence> unity-2d

[17:30] <ttoine> zequence, gnome shell, around 55%. I had a few minutes at 75% but impossible to find why

[22:00] <Len-nb> zequence, good to hear... when can we test? :)
[22:06] <zequence> Len-nb: He posted a patch to the mail list, so one could try building PA from source
[22:06] <zequence> Don't know if he
[22:06] <zequence> Dont' know if he's submitting the patch to raring, or just to PA
[22:06] <zequence> I'm behind with the SRU for jack. I could try get this done as well
[22:08] <Len-nb> I would like to see it for both r and q
[22:09] <Len-nb> it seems 12.10 has the same problem
[22:09] <zequence> I'd say it's safe to say 12.04 also, just that the symptoms are different on different machines
[22:10] <zequence> I could devote some time on this next week. Put up patched versions of PA in a ppa. Then start a SRU process for some packages
[22:11] <zequence> This week I was having some noob problems with updating the kernel, that took many hours
[22:19] <Len-nb> zequence, in following the thread in PA, it looks like there is still work going on.
[22:20] <Len-nb> There may still be more problems to fix
[22:21] <Len-nb> The commit may not come till next week anyway
[22:23] <Len-nb> 12.04 has a different version of PA (1.*) than 12.10/13.04 (2.*)
[22:23]  * Len-nb has to pick up his son
[22:25]  * zequence will take a 9h nap now, and then play with his new toy: Raspberry PI
