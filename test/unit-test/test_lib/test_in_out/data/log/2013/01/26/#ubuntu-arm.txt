[11:07] <IamTrying> I had OLife installed in my Android tablet. This is 3rd time it crashes the Tablet.
[11:07] <IamTrying> Why??
[11:27] <IamTrying> Why its not showing any boot screen now at all?
[11:28] <IamTrying> Its always black screen
[11:28] <IamTrying> power off/on
[11:28] <IamTrying> always showing black screen
[11:28] <lilstevie> cause you either did something wrong or let the battery go dead
[11:31] <IamTrying> lilstevie, right now the usb from Android Eee Pad is connected to my laptop and `lsusb` does not show anything at all when i plug in or out
[11:34] <lilstevie> so flat battery
[11:36] <IamTrying> lilstevie, i have connected adapter now, and i see OLife Boot screen to fail mode like all those boot lines
[11:59] <IamTrying> lilstevie, do you know if there is any new release of OLife i was using ages old one.
[12:00] <lilstevie> no newer version
[12:00] <lilstevie> others have done alternatives, and my interest in tf101 is minimal
[12:05] <IamTrying> lilstevie, http://lilstevie.geek.nz/ports/OLiFE-Prime-Edition.tar.gz  - those files are empty????? is it removed???
[12:06] <lilstevie> where are you opening the link from?
[12:07] <lilstevie> hm
[12:08] <lilstevie> IamTrying: and if you try download it from http://lilstevie.geek.nz/downloads/
[12:08] <lilstevie> new system probably broke the old links
[12:09] <IamTrying> lilstevie, old links are broken but this works now thank you. http://lilstevie.geek.nz/downloads
[12:10] <lilstevie> IamTrying: you can blame the people who decided to adify my links for that
[12:12] <IamTrying> OK :)
[12:13] <IamTrying> https://tari.in/www/eng/articles/transformer/
[12:35] <IamTrying> lilstevie, after downloading from your new link i get this now? https://gist.github.com/4642079
[13:18] <IamTrying> lilstevie, i again downloaded the file but its not running OLife your download is broken? Is there any alternative?
[13:38] <IamTrying> lilstevie, after dong the FLASH why it turns of the Tablet it does all the installation and then it never turn it on.
[13:39] <IamTrying> In the terminal it shows its formating and all done but in the Tablet its always black screen.

[13:55] <IamTrying> lilstevie, here its doing nothing http://i.imgur.com/hzdKv3o.png
[14:20] <IamTrying> Putting device into Nv3P Phone Update mode  > Nvflash started  and it does nothing else...
[15:21] <IamTrying> lilstevie, how do i exit APC mode? after doing flash and update it always remain in Black screen.
[15:22] <lilstevie> hold the power button for >10sec
[15:23] <IamTrying> lilstevie, i did not 10sec, 20sec, 30sec no result. Then i connect USB and lsusb shows its still in APC mode.
[15:24] <IamTrying> Right now i have the power button on hold. But still i have black screen. Once i go to OLife and again use option 2 or 3, i can see the screen turns on for showing update status
[15:25] <IamTrying> But holding power button >10sec or more is not booting or rebooting nor existing the APC mode.
[15:28] <IamTrying> lilstevie, what can i do in such situation? Its completely remain on APC mode, nothing happening when i do power off/on >10sec etc

[15:31] <IamTrying> I think your download release version is conflicted one. It was working before when you had old links.
[15:31] <IamTrying> Can you please give me the old link files?? Your current files from download is conflict it has something strange causing it.
[15:31] <lilstevie> the files are the exact same
[15:31] <lilstevie> no different
[15:32] <IamTrying> lilstevie, i am very sure it is wrong, because i remember i had that file and i can work with it but the recent new files gives me this: https://gist.github.com/4642079
[15:32] <lilstevie> the difference is literally mv ports/OLiFE.tar.gz protected/path/OLiFE.tar.gz_version_md5sum
[15:33] <lilstevie> IamTrying: seriously don't tell me what you are very sure is wrong
[15:33] <lilstevie> I know what I did
[15:34] <IamTrying> lilstevie, but your old files all was perfectly working, now it does not.
[15:34]  * lilstevie facepalms
[15:35] <IamTrying> when i do option 3. in past it was saying "Nvflash started [resume mode]"
[15:35] <lilstevie> check the md5sum
[15:38] <lilstevie> IamTrying:
[15:38] <lilstevie> $ openssl md5 OLiFE*
[15:38] <lilstevie> MD5(OLiFE-Prime-Edition.tar.gz_1.2a_TF101_767779ccfa200e5e00b2f1e33a3d73a9)= 767779ccfa200e5e00b2f1e33a3d73a9
[15:38] <lilstevie> MD5(OLiFE.tar.gz_1.2a_TF101_c30263fd8271a23bb211fd9fdd69fa45)= c30263fd8271a23bb211fd9fdd69fa45

[15:39] <lilstevie> md5sums are the same as in that post that hasn't been edited since nov 2011
[15:40] <IamTrying> OK - strange let me show you something what is happening right now.
[15:41] <lilstevie> I'd rather go to sleep
[15:43] <IamTrying> lilstevie, http://imgur.com/WDGG0Su,dTX4m74   - after doing the option 3 > 2 > 2 i have this screens
[15:44] <IamTrying> And it in past, was rebooting , and now if i hold power off button >10sec then it again goes to APC mode and remain in black screen
