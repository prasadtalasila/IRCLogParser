[12:23] <wookey> can someone upload https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/util-linux/+bug/1061609 please. It's a trivial patch stopping util-linux from building for arm
[12:23] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1061609 in util-linux (Ubuntu) "arm64/aarch64 support for util-linux" [Undecided,New]
[12:23] <wookey> (arm64)
[12:24] <ogra_> morphis, nope, TI used maintain the gstreamer bits in their PPA, not sure what happens to this now that OMAP is dead
[12:37] <hrw> wookey: maybe better ask on #ubuntu-devel
[12:38] <xnox> wookey: please stop making patches to update config.guess|sub and always introduce dh_autoreconf helper. On one package already, I got lintian warning that config.guess|sub is too old from one of your "manual" updates =)
[12:38] <xnox> wookey: I am happy to sponsor that, but I will change it to use dh_autoreconf
[12:39] <xnox> wookey: also you should subscribe ubuntu-sponsors team instead of pinging people =)
[12:40] <xnox> then your patch gets into the queue for sponsorship: http://reqorts.qa.ubuntu.com/reports/sponsoring/
[13:05] <hrw> and then you can hope that one day it will land
[13:05] <xnox> hrw: /me is patch-piloting tomorrow and I tend to prefer build/cross-build fixes & core packages =)
[13:06] <ppisati> OMG!?!?! OMAP is dead?!?!?!
[13:06] <hrw> xnox: for current dev there is always hope. sru == abandon any hope unless you have cve for it
[13:07] <mint_> so whats this ubuntu arm bussiness?
[13:09] <xnox> mint_: it's just a channel specific to armhf port of ubuntu (and armel in the past)
[13:10] <mint_> is it going to be like a full linus OS, or more like an anroid thingy
[13:10] <hrw> mint_: you ask about 'ubuntu phone' or 'ubuntu on arm'?
[13:11] <mint_> isnt arm for the phone
[13:11] <hrw> I saw x86 phone last week
[13:11] <hrw> and mips phone month earlier
[13:11] <xnox> mint_: no, #ubuntu-arm is for the whole ubuntu: dev boards, servers, desktops, netbooks. E.g. ac100, pandaboard, etc.
[13:11] <hrw> mint_: you may want #ubuntu-phone
[13:11] <mint_> oh my bad
[13:12] <xnox> mint_: if you want to know about phone see #ubuntu-phone, for ubuntu on android (a separate project) #ubuntu-android, there is also
[13:12] <xnox> #ubuntu-nexus for ubuntu core on nexus7 tablet.

[13:52] <lilstevie> speaking of sponsoring and stuff like that, who would be the best person to talk to in regards to getting a kernel sponsored and in universe
[13:56] <ogra_> xnox, i think itrs a race, it doesnt show up on subsequent runs
[13:56] <xnox> ogra_: clean flash, clean first boot, wait for ubiquity, tap hostname, onboard pops up and I fill in the hostname just fine and finish the configure.
[13:56] <xnox> =(
[13:57] <ogra_> move on, sometimes it needs until the wlan setup
[13:57] <xnox> hmm..
[13:57]  * xnox is testing/uploading udev rules to flash nexus7 without sudo & then usb-creator work.
[13:58] <ogra_> yay

[14:08] <wookey> xnox: OK. noted. Packages don't always want to use dh_autoreconf, but I agree it's a better plan.
[14:09] <wookey> Packagers
[14:09] <xnox> wookey: i mean, if debian doesn't accept that change that's fine. But dh_autoreconf is a much simplier "patch" to maintain.
[14:09] <wookey> Right
[14:09] <wookey> Will do henceforth
[14:09] <xnox> =)
[14:10] <wookey> autoconf patches are an abomination. I've had hours of fun with libffi

[14:22] <uragano2> Hello, i am using ubuntu 12.04.1 often via ssh. Few days ago i noticed that on logon it doesn't show anymore last login details. Searching i discover the command "last", but it says that there is no log file.
[14:22] <uragano2> ...so i created it and after this it worked fine, but after the reboot the file has been deleted....i don'tunderstand because, do u have an explanation?? Thanks
[14:24] <uragano2> somebody noticed this problem before?
[14:26] <ogra_> uragano2, are you sure its not a diskspce problem ?
[14:26] <ogra_> *space
[14:27] <uragano2> ogra_: 77GB free
[14:27] <ogra_> and the rootfs is mounted rw, no errors in dmesg etc ?
[14:31] <uragano2> ogra_: dmseg seems clean, should i check for something of particular? rootfs is mounted rw
[14:31] <ogra_> no, i was just going through the obvious bits :)

[14:40] <xnox> ogra_: the udev snippet you pasted a while ago w.r.t. setting udev-acl doesn't make the device writtable =(
[14:40] <ogra_> xnox, weird, works here
[14:41] <xnox> ogra_: do you have it named specially or did you just patch the existing udev-acl rules file?
[14:41] <ogra_> i'm actually trying to find it, one sec
[14:42] <ogra_> hmpf
[14:42] <ogra_> i dont seem to have it anymore
[14:42] <ogra_> it should have something like: SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="18d1", ATTR{idProduct}=="4e40"
[14:43] <xnox> yeap. and +TAG="udev-acl" or explicit test and call for udev-acl binary.
[14:43] <xnox> hmmm...
=== Guest7248 is now known as Phryq
[14:44] <ogra_> not sure, might need a reboot to make udevbd pick it up
[14:47] <ogra_> xnox, is the above a typo ?
[14:47] <ogra_> TAG+="udev-acl" would be right
[14:47] <ogra_> not +TAG="udev-acl"
[14:47] <xnox> yeah typo on IRC
[14:47] <ogra_> k
[14:47] <ogra_> very weird

[14:54] <uragano2> ogra_: are u using Ubuntu 12.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.2.0-1412-omap4 armv7l)?
[14:55] <ogra_> uragano2, not arm, no, my pandas are either 12.10 or raring
[14:58] <jpastore> so i have a strange problem. i installed 12.10 on my beaglebone which is powered by a solar panel and battery. i under estimated the needed batteries and the bone shutdown unexpectedly. now via usb all i see is a uboot prompt. is there a way to reload the boot loader without writing a whole new image?
[15:13] <ogra_> jpastore, better ask in #beagle, wo dont have any images for the bone in ubuntu
[15:14] <jpastore> ogra_, is my only own option writing a whole new disk image? i mounted the sd card in my laptop and it is accessible. i'm backing up my work...can i get a list of installed packages from the file system?
[15:15] <ogra_> sorry, no idea, i have never seen or touched a beaglebone
[15:15] <uragano2> ogra_: i think that the bug is this https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/1019338
[15:15] <ubot2`> Launchpad bug 1019338 in Ubuntu "ami-4438b474 lacks /var/log/{btmp,wtmp,lastlog}" [Low,Fix released]
[15:16] <ogra_> unlikely, it is about cloud images
[15:16] <ogra_> (which uses a completely own build and boot infrastructure)
[15:17] <jpastore> ogra_, not needed. i am not interested in cloud9 right now. i installed ubuntu-arm 12.10 on the beaglebone and everything was fine until this happened. is there a way extrapolate a list of installed packages by looking at the filesystem? cache of debs or something?
[15:18] <uragano2> uff...i have no idea why i lost my logs, i'll make a new installation. Thanks anyway for your help!
[15:18] <ogra_> jpastore, what os is your host machine running ?
[15:19] <jpastore> ogra_, also ubuntu
[15:19] <ogra_> (where you mount the SD)
[15:19] <ogra_> k
[15:19] <ogra_> install quemu-user-static
[15:19] <ogra_> then copy the qemu-arm-static from /usr/bin to /usr/bin on the SD
[15:19] <jpastore> just updated this laptop to 12.10 and as always it's a process that requires punishment.
[15:19] <ogra_> when you now *manually* mount the SD, you can chroot into the filesystem
[15:20] <ogra_> (and do all operations as if you were under an arm system)
[15:21] <jpastore> ok let me look up what quemu is =)
[15:21] <ogra_> qemu (sorry, typo)
[15:22] <ogra_> qemu ususally is used for VMs ... but the -user variant, together with a setup for the binfmt modules can give you native arm support on x86 without a VM
[15:23] <ogra_> ubuntu has that setup by default with the qemu-user-static package so you can chroot into any arm filesystem and just use it
[15:23] <jpastore> np. still trying to figure it out =) so i can run this and emulate the arm chip and access the file system as if it was booted and use apt-get to get a list of packages?
[15:23] <ogra_> right
[15:24] <jpastore> ok package installed. since I've copied this over, i'm running from /usr/bin initially, it just needs access to the bin after i chroot?
[15:26] <ogra_> right
[15:26] <czajkowski> marvin24: ping
[15:26] <ogra_> the kernel recognizes the binaries you execute as arm ones and wraps them in qemu execution calls
[15:26] <czajkowski> marvin24: which ppa are you referring to https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+question/219088
[15:40] <jpastore> ogra_, thanks got local apt-get running...this is pretty kewl. i didn't know you could do this.
[15:40] <ogra_> :)
[15:41] <ogra_> note that if you actually install or remove packages you should make soure to have /proc mounted inside the chroot (and dont forget to unmount it when laving it)

[15:48] <xnox> ogra_: well =) now I can do usb-creator bits with format v1.0
[15:48] <ogra_> marvin24, just take over the ac100 enablement one asnd delete the others
[15:48] <marvin24> ogra_: yes, is this wrong?
[15:48] <jpastore> ogra_, dude. this is the second time you've help. can i send you a cup of coffee or something. i really appreciate you taking the time to help me. good people on IRC are way to under appreciated

[22:11] <Rjs> I talked about usb-ethernet on the nexus7 here a day or so ago... I now tried it and got it to work very easily: I recompiled the ubuntu kernel with CONFIG_USB_CDC_COMPOSITE and without CONFIG_USB_G_SERIAL, added a couple of lines to /etc/network/interfaces (I guess using NetworkManager would work too) and apt-get install openssh-server and that was it
[22:11] <Rjs> now the usb-serial console works just as before and I have an additional usb0 Ethernet device so I can ssh to the nexus7 through usb (and do package installs through usb etc.) :)
[22:13] <Rjs> (I used a static IP address without a default route, so I can leave it up all the time, as I'm used to doing on my openmoko gta02, but I guess you could use dhcp etc. via the networkmanager ui just as well... I think it's just a normal wired interface as far as NM is concerned)
[22:17] <Rjs> kulve: thanks for the info you gave me a day or so ago, read the above ^^^ if you're interested...
[22:22] <Rjs> hmm, maybe you folks at ubuntu could consider making CONFIG_USB_CDC_COMPOSITE the default for the nexus7 kernel, since it only adds features to CONFIG_USB_G_SERIAL? or maybe compile all of the usb gadget drivers as modules and load g_serial on boot, so the users could switch gadgets without a kernel recompile?
[22:37] <AmEv> OK, back for some grueling... No luck so far getting Ubuntu native on the Toshiba Thrive.
[22:39] <AmEv> Tried AC100, Asus Transformer, Advent Vega, Motorola Xoom, even modified Thrive source; either my display shuts off, or it gets stuck at the Fastboot "Loading" screen.
[22:41] <AmEv> I did try to do the chroot method, but still ended up with no display :(
[22:46] <lilstevie> AmEv: what version of the kernel is that
[22:46] <AmEv> Native? 2.6.39.
[22:46] <lilstevie> ok hmm
[22:46] <lilstevie> thrive is tegra 2 yeah?
[22:47] <AmEv> Yep.
[22:47] <lilstevie> although 2.6.39 AFAIK wasn't affected by the issue I am thinking of
[22:48] <AmEv> I know someone was trying to port a 3.* kernel over, but had to leave.
[22:49] <AmEv> Whoops, wrong button...
[22:50] <AmEv> I know I do have a working rootfs on an SD card...
[22:54] <AmEv> Anyway, lilstevie, thanks for coming back again. I remember you giving advice a few days ago.
[22:54] <AmEv> I'll be here with my Thrive, trying things out.
[22:54] <lilstevie> heh
[22:54] <lilstevie> well I don't know, you could maybe check your .config
[22:55] <AmEv> Yeah, the first thing I did was enable Framebuffer Console and VT. Nope...
[23:39] <wbf> Hello!

[23:42] <wbf> sorry if you cannot see it, it's that fast
[23:42] <AmEv_> Ehh, I got disconnected for a sec...
[23:45] <AmEv_> Anyway, any thoughts as to bootup problems?
[23:45] <wbf> AmEv_, One. as in I cannot install OPENGL and I need it
[23:45] <wbf> well I can installit*
[23:45] <wbf> it's just I cannot find it
=== AmEv_ is now known as AmEv
[23:46] <lilstevie> wbf: 1) ARM devices do not have OpenGL we have OpenGLES
[23:46] <AmEv> Well, I'm having bootup problems on my Thrive...
[23:46] <lilstevie> second of all you need to see if there are drivers for the GPU
[23:46] <AmEv> When I made my own initfs, I didn't have any errors on the final one...
[23:47] <wbf> lilstevie, I already installed the driver, but do you know of any good linux games for ARM?
[23:47] <AmEv> Should I create a Launchpad bug?
[23:48] <lilstevie> AmEv: only if you can determine that ubuntu is the problem :p
[23:48] <lilstevie> cause it is more than likely your kernel
[23:48] <lilstevie> wbf: you are kidding right?
[23:48] <lilstevie> :p
[23:48] <AmEv> OK.
[23:49] <wbf> lilstevie, Okay sorry about that, I guess I need to go to offtopic..
[23:49] <lilstevie> wbf: not my point
[23:49] <AmEv> Strange that known-working Tegra 2 kernels aren't working on my device....
[23:49] <wbf> lilstevie, so there's no games for arm linux?
[23:49] <lilstevie> wbf: there are not many games available really, and even less support openGLES
[23:50] <lilstevie> AmEv: what did you expect, you cannot just take another devices kernel and expect it to work
[23:50] <AmEv> Didn't think so. Not like x86 where there's a universal boot disk....
[23:51] <wbf> lilstevie, well what BETA games are there?
[23:52] <AmEv> I wonder: What's the best kernel (cross-)compiler for the Tegra 2 devices?
