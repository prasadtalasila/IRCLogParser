[06:57] <magespawn> Good morning and Happy New Year.
[07:40] <Kilos> ty magespawn and all the best to you and family too
[07:55] <Kilos> had a major crash after we did the ssh thing
[07:57] <Kilos> gonna reboot and see if nvidia will crash me again
[08:06] <Kilos> yay no crash
[09:06] <Kilos> hi theblazehen 
[09:06] <Kilos> happy new year
[09:06] <Kilos> and to you and family superfly 
[09:10] <superfly> thanks Kilos
[09:10] <superfly> Kilos: het jy lekker geslaap?
[09:11] <Kilos> nee man ek moes die machine reg maak
[09:11] <Kilos> als goed nou weer dankie
[09:11] <Kilos> why you using the taal today superfly ?
[09:12] <superfly> I don't get a chance to use it very often
[09:12] <Kilos> oh so just keeping in touch kinda
[09:12] <superfly> I guess
[10:02] <Squirm> morning
[10:02] <Kilos> hi Squirm 
[10:02] <Kilos> afternoon actually
[10:03] <Kilos> im getting old. didnt fp today
[10:03] <Squirm> heh
[10:03] <Squirm> I could have
[10:04] <Squirm> though it didn't cross my mind
[10:04] <Kilos> lol
[10:05] <Squirm> 4 hours sleep :)
[10:05] <Squirm> failed compared to last year though
[10:05] <Kilos> i also had min about 5.5 or so
[10:05] <Kilos> had a bad crash that needed sorting
[10:07] <Kilos> weirdest thing. nvidia tainted the kernel
[10:11] <superfly> Kilos: nvidia "taints" the kernel because it is not open source, there is nothing wrong with a "tainted" kernel
[10:11] <Kilos> oh. well then something else got in too superfly 
[10:12] <Kilos> pc hung then couldnt boot past half the boot script
[10:12] <Kilos> then fsck from kde made things worse
[10:13] <Kilos> then boot-repair made pc say no OS found
[10:13] <Kilos> whew
[10:14] <Kilos> and all the nvidia stuff couldnt install after fresh install without formatting /home
[10:15] <Kilos> but too much on this home to lose. all the iptables stuff and ssh commands ewtc
[10:15] <Kilos> tec too
[10:15] <Kilos> hai
[10:15] <Kilos> etc
[10:18] <Kilos> after many installs pc actually booted to cli and i then apt-get purged nvidia
[10:18] <Kilos> also changed graphics card for ians then next install went without a hitch
[10:19] <Kilos> 6am this morning
[10:42] <inetpro> superfly: ping
[10:42] <Kilos> als wat goed is inetpro vir jou en familie
[10:43] <inetpro> Kilos: dankie, selle vir jou
[10:44]  * inetpro wonders whether Zambezia is worth a watch at the moviehouse
[10:44] <inetpro> cinemas cost way to much these days
[10:45]  * inetpro wishing everyone a Blessed and a Happy New Year!
[11:21] <superfly> inetpro: pong
[11:22] <superfly> inetpro: i thought so, but then I know the people who made it
[11:28] <superfly> inetpro: it is a good story, the music is great, the animation not bad (though it is not a Pixar), and the dialogue is entertaining and quite African despite the US voice actors
[11:28] <Squirm> oh yeah
[11:28] <Squirm> happy new year
[11:28] <Squirm> :)
[11:29] <superfly> Squirm: you gonna try sobering up a bit this year?
[11:29] <Kilos> lol
[11:29] <Squirm> superfly: I'm sober 99% of the time :/
[11:38] <superfly> wouldn't think so based on the number of times you mention having a hangover on IRC 
[11:39]  * Squirm keeps quiet from now on
[11:40] <Kilos> hehe
[11:40] <superfly> heh Squirm just don't mention it so often :-P 
[11:40] <Squirm> and it isn't often
[11:53] <inetpro> superfly: thanks 
[11:54] <inetpro> sad part is that it's 3d 
[11:55] <superfly> inetpro: we watched it in "2d"
[11:55] <superfly> I can't handle 3d
[11:58] <inetpro> with only one eye I also can't watch this stupid 3d stuff 
[12:00] <superfly> inetpro: one eye?
[12:03]  * inetpro been a one eyed bandid for ever
[12:03] <inetpro> don't know what it's like to see with two eyes
[12:05] <inetpro> oh and there are thousands of others in the same boat
[12:05] <superfly> inetpro: wow, I didn't know that
[12:05] <superfly> *bandit
[12:06] <inetpro> that's why I think the whole idea of a 3d movie/tv is just plain stupid
[12:08] <inetpro> superfly: yes bandit, sorry :-)
[12:09] <inetpro> superfly: I only realised that I was blind at 5 years
[12:11] <inetpro> superfly: that was when my dad tried to teach me to aim with only one eye with a pellet gun
[12:12] <superfly> ah,ok
[12:12] <inetpro> I think it was a bigger shock for him than for me at that stage
[12:13] <Kilos> wb magespawn 
[12:13] <Kilos> join the one eyed bandits
[12:18] <inetpro> Kilos: how did you get blinded in one eye?
[12:18] <inetpro> was it since that accident?
[12:19] <Kilos> piece of a chisel went in
[12:19] <inetpro> eish!
[12:19] <Kilos> ya eina accident
[12:19] <inetpro> Kilos: when?
[12:20] <Kilos> um
[12:20] <Kilos> 85/6
[12:21] <Kilos> um
[12:21] <Kilos> 89
[12:21] <inetpro> how was that experience?
[12:21] <Kilos> very painful
[12:21] <Kilos> for weeks
[12:21] <Kilos> and after every op even worse
[12:22] <Kilos> learned the value of morphine there
[12:23] <superfly> you people are being too gross for me
[12:24] <Kilos> hahaha
[12:24] <inetpro> superfly: haha
[12:24] <Kilos> every op they take the eye right out to work on it
[12:24]  * inetpro wbbl
[12:25] <Kilos> then fill it with salt water after again
[12:25] <Kilos> k
[12:44] <Kilos>  This may be because the DVD is encrypted and a DVD decryption library is not installed.
[12:44] <Kilos> what needs to be installed to watch a dvd?
[12:45] <Kilos> cant play a harry potter dvd

[17:28] <Kilos> happy new year to you kbmonkey 
[17:28] <Kilos> welcome to ubuntu-za
[17:29] <kbmonkey> thanks Kilos :)
[17:30] <kbmonkey> I am very suprised to find that 11.04 has reached end of life! I thought .04 releases were LTS (3 years). what gives?
[17:31] <Kilos> every second one
[17:32] <kbmonkey> did you have a nice xmas, Kilos ?
[17:37] <Kilos> nice and quiet ty kbmonkey  and you lad?
[17:37] <Kilos> noisy new year till 00.45 this morning when whole area seems to have run out of fireworks
[17:38] <kbmonkey> went to the dam in the midlands. had a nice downpour XD
[17:38] <kbmonkey> next door to the firestation, they hooted their trucks and sirens. ha ha ha.
[17:39] <Kilos> lol
[17:39] <Kilos> ive actually never been one that celebrates the new year because its just another day
[17:40] <kbmonkey> I installed xubuntu-desktop from ubuntu 11.04, and now i see its not supported :/
[17:40] <Kilos> aw that sucks
[17:41] <kbmonkey> so now i guess i'll have to install the new one
[17:41] <Kilos> no man
[17:41] <Kilos> 10.10 just lost support 6 months ago
[17:41] <Kilos> oh ya thats 6 months to 11.04
[17:42] <Kilos> im still running maverick on old pc
[17:42] <kbmonkey> i have 12.10 here :)
[17:42] <Kilos> installed after support stopped
[17:42] <kbmonkey> I wonder if I can use aptonCD and use the packages in the new release
[17:43] <Kilos> didnt work on 12.04
[17:43] <Kilos> i used to make aptoncds all the time
[17:43] <kbmonkey> thanks :)
[17:44] <Kilos> on 12.04 you have to open it and install packages independantly with gdebi
[17:44] <Kilos> 10.10 opened the cd with synaptic and installed everything for you
[17:48] <kbmonkey> i can give it a try, but murphey says the 11.04 packages might conflict with the 12.10 repos
[17:48] <kbmonkey> did father xmas bring you any nice toys, Kilos ? :]
[17:48] <Kilos> ya they will
[17:49] <Kilos> we had a lekker meal or 3
[17:49] <Kilos> tummy still swollen
[17:50] <Kilos> hey kbmonkey you still gotta 
[17:50] <Kilos> um
[17:50] <Kilos> er
[17:50] <Kilos> write some debugging script for the greeter hey
[17:52] <kbmonkey> I don't have ibid or an ubuntu system at the moment to do that. not sure what a debugging script is, I assume it means including trace/debug output within the bot script.
[17:53] <Kilos> hehe i suppose so
[17:53] <kbmonkey> any particular places within the bot we need debugging?
[17:53] <Kilos> it only greeted once then gave up
[17:54] <kbmonkey> sounds like it's idle timeout gets reset when we don't need it to
[17:55] <kbmonkey> perhaps some of the join/part events are not being filtered properly
[17:55] <Kilos> even if no one says anything all day on the channel it doesnt greet even new peeps
[17:57] <Kilos> and i had to get her a new nick. someone stole QP and grouped it to their nick
[17:59] <kbmonkey> awe
[18:00] <Kilos> ya the swine
[18:01] <Kilos> new ones nick is QA and its registered with freenode with their bot registry
[18:01] <Kilos> ive learned
[18:01] <Trixar_za> They have a bot registry?
[18:02] <Kilos> hows everything your side kbmonkey ?
[18:02] <Kilos> lol the register it in a different way than ordinary nicks Trixar_za 
[18:02] <kbmonkey> fine fine. its rainy and cool today. nice after the boiling last few days
[18:02] <Kilos> yeah been hot
[18:04] <kbmonkey> well, i guess im going to reboot and install 12.10 from scratch
[18:05] <Kilos> at least install is fast
[18:05] <Kilos> takes 20 mins here for 12.04
[18:05] <Kilos> kde takes 25
[18:06] <kbmonkey> I just hope the update/reinstall of applications wont take too much data
[18:06] <smile4ever> Kilos: :DD
[18:06] <Kilos> eeek
[18:06] <Kilos> over 300m i think
[18:06] <smile4ever> Kilos: have you written a new blog entry recently? :p
[18:07] <kbmonkey> i already used 100MB installing an unsupported xubuntu-desktop
[18:07] <Kilos> updates got good. down to under 20m
[18:07] <Kilos> nope smile4ever 
[18:07] <Kilos> eina kbmonkey 
[18:07] <smile4ever> Kilos: :(
[18:07] <smile4ever> I want new blog entry :DD
[18:07] <kbmonkey> hi smile4ever :]
[18:07] <Kilos> dont run updates while installing
[18:08] <kbmonkey> would it be a bad thing to rather keep the machine on 11.04? it wont receive any new security updates tho :/
[18:08] <Kilos> then once installed you can decide if you got data to upgrade
[18:08] <Kilos> i didnt like 11.04
[18:09] <smile4ever> hi kbmonkey. are you a knowledge base? :p
[18:09] <Kilos> that was the start of unity
[18:09] <smile4ever> Kilos: Unity began earlier :p
[18:09] <Kilos> didntr like xubuntu 11.04 either
[18:09] <smile4ever> ubuntu netbook remix, remember :)
[18:09] <Kilos> no man smile4ever 
[18:09] <Kilos> 10.10 was gnome2
[18:10] <kbmonkey> this is xubuntu, with xfce :}
[18:10] <Kilos> but new unity works ok kbmonkey
