[09:38] <JohnTeddy> I have an laptop that is a couple years old and was cheap at the time, it uses Intel i915 graphics. When I plugin an external monitor, it freezes sometimes. I'm able to move the mouse around, or do control/alt/f2, though nothing responds in the gui.
[09:38] <JohnTeddy> I tried updating to xorg-edgers, and x swat ubuntu, then ppa-purge to revert back.. I tried downgrading mesa... nothing I do seems to work.
[09:38] <JohnTeddy> I followed various instructions on launchpad.
[09:39] <JohnTeddy> I can see errors in dmesg and in .xsessions-errors
[09:41] <JohnTeddy> I don't really know how to diagnose this well, and I'm not sure what to do at this point.
[11:13] <jarlath> One application (System Monitor) is behaving odd in terms of window management. I maximize so the window controls are merged with the global-menu and quit. When I next run it, it is not maximized in this way, but as large as it can be as a stand-alone window. No other applicaiton is doing this. What do I file the bug against, the window manager or the applicaition?
[11:32] <mitya57> jarlath: I can reproduce this bug with metacity, so please file it against gnome-system-monitor.
[11:32] <mitya57> If you give me the bug number, I'll even confirm it :)
[11:35] <jarlath> Thank you mitya57 . Are you using Unity 2D then? I'm using 3D which means, I think, that compiz is the window manager.
[11:36] <mitya57> jarlath: I'm using gnome classic with metacity
[11:36] <mitya57> and I can reproduce it here => it's not a bug in some window manager, but in g-s-m itself
[11:38] <jarlath> mitya57: that was my next question :) Thanks, I'll have a link in a moment.

[11:51] <jarlath> thanks mitya57
[11:52] <jarlath> Same issue with update-manager, could you confirm please?
[11:56] <mitya57> jarlath: on 12.10 update-manager is not maximizable at all, so I can't confirm it
[11:57] <jarlath> mitya57: Okay, I'm on 12.04. Thanks for that.
[11:57] <jarlath> Can a 12.04 user confirm my issue for 12.04 before I send a bug report?
[12:00] <mitya57> I don't think there are many 12.04 users online here...
[12:02] <hjd> mitya57: I think update-manager is maximizable on 12.10 if you have updates available. I can't verify that right now, but I remember seeing the issue you are discussing.
[12:02] <mitya57> hjd: thanks
[12:03] <mitya57> jarlath: so please feel free to file a bug, hopefully someone will look at it
[12:04] <jarlath> mitya57: ok.

[17:32] <TheLordOfTime> dariebi, you may want to ask in #ubuntu for help, if it is a bug you can come back here and we can help you file the bug (although #ubuntu would likely say how to file a bug if it is one)
