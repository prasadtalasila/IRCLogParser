[11:32] <qwebirc2936> Hey, what an excellent service is this
[11:32] <qwebirc2936> I have a problem with video playback using the internal player
[11:34] <qwebirc2936> When I play a mp4 file, it seems as if the colors are shifted downward
[11:34] <qwebirc2936> On the internet I found some reference to faulty hue values
[11:34] <qwebirc2936> But changing hue has no effect
[13:12] <qwebirc2936> Anybody? Or is it easier if I post on the forum?

[18:33] <RobertLaptop> Anyone one around after upgrading last night all my frontend and secondary backend keep trying the update the DB scheme although the master backend doesn't see a change.  All systems are using the same git build based .deb
[20:24] <tonsofpcs> RobertLaptop: from what version to what?
[20:24] <RobertLaptop> I am running Mythbuntu 10.04.
[20:25] <tonsofpcs> as am I.  Myth 0.26 did similar to me, I rolled back to 0.25
[20:25] <RobertLaptop> Not sure the from what version.  I was running .26 and then did an upgrade last night and it started happening.
[20:27] <RobertLaptop> I have been on .26 for weeks I doubt I can role back to .25 without major issues.
[20:30] <tonsofpcs> oh, interesting
[20:39] <RobertLaptop> Running mythtv-setup made my problems with the backend to go away but the front end goes to a blue screen and just sits there.
[20:39] <RobertLaptop> I just turned on Verbose debugging.
