[04:43] <qwebirc74149> What is the recommened boot drive size?
[04:53] <Bonj> do you mean a dedicated partition mounted as /boot ?
[04:56] <Bonj> that seems to have fallen out of favour.
[04:58] <Bonj> Do you mean the root partition? You could get away with a rather small one.I currently have my recordings on my root partition and it has 321G used... of which 318G is recordings.
[06:02] <qwebirc74149> I just used 30g, I figured that would be enogh for the OS
[06:03] <qwebirc74149> I will be using another raid for the recordings
[06:05] <Bonj> cool

[21:58] <sabhain> anyone have periodic drop outs of schedules direct data for one random channel?
[22:12] <sabhain> strange .. 12 days later, it's populated with information again.  Forcing a full update doesn't fill the next 10 days.
[23:29] <Shadow__X> sabhain: what are you using for listing data
