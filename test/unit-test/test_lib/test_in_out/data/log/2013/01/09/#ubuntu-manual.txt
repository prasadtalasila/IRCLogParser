[16:14] <CarstenG> Hi
[16:14] <hannie> hello CarstenG and all
[16:15] <CarstenG> Hey Hannie, congratulations for the release of the Dutch manual!
[16:15] <hannie> thanks, very happy it is published, thanks to many of you too
[16:16] <CarstenG> You're welcome :-)
[16:16] <hannie> The French, German, Slovenian, Italian, Greek, Malay will follow soon
[16:16] <CarstenG> And now do you continue wih the quantal release?
[16:17] <CarstenG> Well, the German is the last in you list :-)
[16:17] <hannie> CarstenG, we decided to stick to the LTS versions, because we have a very small team
[16:17] <CarstenG> 28% of translation left...
[16:18] <hannie> CarstenG, that sounds good, but 28% of ???? It makes a difference!
[16:18] <CarstenG> Ah, ok
[16:19] <CarstenG> 28% means 529  strings to translate...
[16:19] <hannie> ok, but we are with 2 translators at the moment and I do not have that much time
[16:20] <hannie> Besides, we are talking of 529 very long strings
[16:20] <hannie> *about
[16:20] <hannie> They are often complete paragraphs
[16:21] <CarstenG> oh, I meant the German version, there are 529 to do...
[16:22] <hannie> CarstenG, If I merge precise with quantal there will probably be less than shown in LP (untranslated)
[16:22] <CarstenG> You would have only 431 strings to do for quantal :-)
[16:22] <CarstenG> Yes, you will get some fuzzy strings...
[16:22] <hannie> I could try a merge with 100% translated Precise-e2 and see how many fuzzies there are
[16:23] <CarstenG> Most of them have only small changes in syntax for example
[16:23] <hannie> Well, ok, I will try the merge in a minute
[16:24] <hannie> And if you help me with the screenshots, perhaps we could publish Quantal after all ;)
[16:25] <CarstenG> Sure, I will help where I can :-)
[16:25] <cqfd93> Hi all, and congratulations to Hannie!
[16:25] <hannie> Great. I will let you know if Quantal is worth finishing
[16:26] <hannie> hey cqfd93 Isn't it wonderful. Now the French version is in the making and will follow soon.
[16:26] <cqfd93> yes, it's great!
[16:26] <CarstenG> *thumbs up* for quantal
[16:27] <CarstenG> Do we publish the manuals to the Software Center, too?
[16:27] <hannie> haha, you have almost persuaded me :)
[16:28] <hannie> CarstenG, that is a good question.
[16:29] <CarstenG> :-) I only like the green bar at 100% on LP ;-)
[16:30] <hannie> Software Center only has English 12.04 and 12.10 at the moment
[16:31] <hannie> I have added a line in Software Center: Dutch version can be obtained at ubuntu-manual.org
[16:33] <CarstenG> You mean a comment?
[16:33] <CarstenG> Yes, I see it.
[16:34] <hannie> Yes, as a comment. I will do the same for 12.10 now
[16:34] <CarstenG> really?
[16:34] <CarstenG> than you _have_ to release quantal :-)
[16:36] <CarstenG> ok, I'm out for half an hour.
[16:36] <CarstenG> See you later.
[17:06] <CarstenG> back :-)
[17:52] <godbyk> I will be publishing them in the Software Center, too, but that process seems awfully slow.
[17:53] <CarstenG> Fine.
[17:54] <CarstenG> The review process is the problem, right?
[17:54] <godbyk> Yes.
[17:54] <godbyk> Perhaps it's improved in the past couple months.
[17:54] <godbyk> We'll find out. :)
[17:56] <CarstenG> I think they have now a bit experience with our Ubuntu Manual ( 3 times in USC) so it should go faster in future...
[18:01] <godbyk> cqfd93: I've just published the French translation of precise-e2.  I sent you an email with some announcement text that you can translate (and rewrite if you like).
[18:01] <godbyk> cqfd93: Congratulations and thanks for all your hard work!  Please pass along my thanks to Enrico and the rest of the translation team, too.
[18:02] <cqfd93> thank you godbyk!!!
[19:59] <godbyk> It looks like the Dutch translation of precise-e2 is already available on Amazon. That was fast!
