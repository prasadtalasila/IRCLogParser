[17:13] <Pralku> hey everyone
[17:14] <Pralku> I'm having a problem adding folders from my ubuntuone cloud, I get a bug everytime
[17:16] <Pralku> namely this one: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntuone-control-panel/+bug/974193
[17:16] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 974193 in ubuntuone-control-panel (Ubuntu) "ubuntuone-control-panel-qt crashed with UnicodeDecodeError in _handle_finished(): 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3 in position 3007: ordinal not in range(128)" [High,Confirmed]
[17:16] <Pralku> I get even if I don't go to the accounts information tab
[17:17] <Pralku> Is there any known workaround for this bug?
[17:18] <Pralku> I'm on a newly installed 12.10 on a intel ivy bridge 3570k using the IGP hd4000
[17:19] <Pralku> 8gb ram  64-bit install
[17:21] <Pralku> wtf, it just started syncing now right out of the blue, strange as hell
[17:22] <Pralku> Ok, after one reboot it didn't work, after reboot I logged in and out fiddling with other stuff and It now works perfectly it seems
[23:28] <poee> when I try to change the account details in ubuntu one it redirects to the browser, and at logging in it says the page is stale
[23:28] <poee> can anyone help
[23:28] <poee> ?
