[03:03] <BobJonkman> Confirmed!  Ubuntu Hour Waterloo at 8:00pm, Almadina Restaurant.  See http://loco.ubuntu.com/events/ubuntu-ca/2160/detail/
[03:04] <BobJonkman> But there's also an IRC chat at 7:00pm on Thursday; I'll be at Almadina at 7:00pm to IRC in IRL
[03:06] <BobJonkman> dscassel: What's this I see in the calendar? "Ubuntu LoCo Games" https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MGU0a290OXFuMnZlbTYyaXJlc2dyZHBwcjggbWxsNThmcm1sbHJsbGZrc2dkMTJ0M2g3Y3NAZw&ctz=America/New_York
[07:09] <DarwinSurvivor> There's a calendar?
[07:24] <BobJonkman1> There's a Google calendar for Ubuntu-ca at http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mll58frmllrllfksgd12t3h7cs%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/New_York
[07:24] <BobJonkman1> And an .ics feed on the LoCo page of events for Ubuntu-ca: http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-ca
[07:25] <BobJonkman1> That was the page, this is the .ics or iCal feed: http://loco.ubuntu.com/teams/ubuntu-ca/ical
[07:26] <BobJonkman1> I use the iCal feed in Thunderbird Lightning; I also have it as an external calendar in my Google calendar.  For a new event I create the LoCo event first, then when it appears on the iCal feed in my Google calendar I copy it to the Ubuntu-ca Google calendar.
[07:28] <BobJonkman1> OK, off to bed.  Shutting down the computer since it's been acting a bit flakey lately.
[07:28] <BobJonkman1> "Did you try turning it off and on again?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2Ph8zwpNyI
[07:37] <DarwinSurvivor> Yay, now I know when things are happening!
[23:21] <genii-around> So Thursday 7-8 meeting here?
