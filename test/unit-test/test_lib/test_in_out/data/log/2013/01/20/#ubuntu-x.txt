[00:01] <bryce> dkms status
[00:01] <bryce> and /var/lib/dkms/*/*/build/make.log
[00:06] <Azelphur> dkms status says "fglrx-updates, 9.000: added"
[00:07] <Azelphur> hmm, /var/lib/dkms/fglrx-updates/9.000/build is empty
[00:10] <bryce> anyway, probably you should just remove all fglrx and reinstall the driver from scratch
[00:10] <bryce> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Troubleshooting/VideoDriverDetection#Problem:_Need_to_purge_-fglrx
[00:11] <bryce> 9 times out of 10 that "fixes" whatever the issue was.
[00:11] <Azelphur> will try it now, but as I say I got this issue first time installing fglrx-updates on a fresh install
[00:11] <bryce> doesn't explain why it broke in the first place, but maybe you can reproduce it.
[00:22] <Azelphur> bryce: followed those instructions, then reinstalled fglrx-updates, same issue :(
[00:45] <bryce> 1087840 is probably your bug
[00:47] <Azelphur> fun, I notice that bug report is requesting unity --replace &, so perhaps I'll post that too
[00:47] <bryce> anyway, enough looking at fglrx.  it's the weekend.  :-D
[00:48] <Azelphur> tried to do the apport collect and it says that no information was collected
[00:48] <Azelphur> :(
[00:48] <Azelphur> Package fglrx-installer-updates not installed and no hook available, ignoring.
[00:48] <bryce> Azelphur, I doubt that'll show anything useful.  Like I said, needs to have the build errors from dkms or whatever before can really say what the cause is
[00:48] <Azelphur> yea
[00:48] <Azelphur> odd that it doesn't even create a log file
[00:48] <bryce> could be just a kernel incompatibility or some such
[00:49] <Azelphur> yea, at least there's a bug up, I'll watch it and see what happens
[00:49] <bryce> hmm, apport-collect should have gathered it, but I bet I need to specifically add that hook.  oh well
[00:49] <Azelphur> hehe, tyvm for your help anyway, I'll keep an eye on that bug and hopefully it'll be fixed soon
[02:33] <agrestringere> Got a quick question: Is there www.launchpad.net based list of all the packages that Ubuntu-X team is responsible for?
[02:33] <agrestringere> Like a huge index style list?
=== Prf_Jako1 is now known as Prf_Jakob
=== Quintasan_ is now known as Quintasan
[09:09] <bryce> yeah - http://www.bryceharrington.org/Arsenal/ubuntu-x-swat/Reports/package-status.html
[09:10] <tjaalton> he left already :)
[09:12] <tjaalton> had the patience to wait full 8min
[09:13] <tjaalton> I also use https://bugs.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-x-swat/+packagebugs from time to time
[09:13] <tjaalton> as depressing as it is..
[09:46] <knittl> hello. I have collected plenty of information about my graphics card/monitor configuration but I'm still not able to get it to work. If anybody has a little time to check my bug report? If more info is required, I'll be glad to provide it https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/727112
[09:46] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 727112 in nvidia-graphics-drivers (Ubuntu) "nvidia-current does not detect hardware capabilities correctly" [Medium,Incomplete]
[09:50] <knittl> hummmâ€¦ this looks promising: http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/showpost.php?p=2039336&postcount=11
[10:09] <knittl> f*** YEAH! that did the trick \o/
