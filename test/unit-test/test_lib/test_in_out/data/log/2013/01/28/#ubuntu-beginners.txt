[03:45] <Bealox> Hi Guys, does anyone know how to change the file name in the magnet-url, before start downloading the file? I'm using rtorrent
[03:46] <Bealox>  I tried to change "dn"(display name) attribute in the magnet link, but it didn't work
[05:50] <r4y> I need help for installing pepper for chrome or chromium, where do I get it from?
[05:59] <mysteriousdarren> http://www.google.com/search?q=pepper+for+chrome+&oq=pepper+for+chrome+&sugexp=chrome,mod=13&sourceid=chrome&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&ie=UTF-8
[06:01] <Unit193> It's not exactly nice to do that, and doesn't give you https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/ as easily.
[06:01] <mysteriousdarren> right posted wrong thing
[06:01] <mysteriousdarren> anyway
[06:02] <Unit193> Comes with Chrome, don't exactly know how to get it in chromium, guessing a link in the plugins dir, but I use nither.
[06:02] <r4y> I am not sure where I went wrong, but I used that link.
[06:02] <Unit193> r4y: ^^
[06:02] <r4y> I don't care which I use
[06:03] <Unit193> http://www.adobe.com/products/about-flash.html doesn't show 11.5?
[06:04] <r4y> I need to mess around for a sec, sorry
[06:05] <r4y> I need to log out and back into Unity
[06:06] <r4y> I am using gnome
[06:13] <r4y> I can't chrome in the Ubuntu Software Center to un-install it and start over
[06:13] <r4y> I can't find chrome there I meant to say
[06:14] <r4y> It's installed but that was after also trying to see if I could get flash to work
[06:14] <r4y> until I found out flash is no longer supported
[06:14] <r4y> well adobe flash that is
[06:15] <r4y> should I do sudo apt-get remove chrome?
[06:15] <Unit193> sudo apt-get purge google-chrome*  should remove any of the versions.
[06:17] <r4y> The following packages were automatically installed and are no longer required:
[06:17] <r4y> linux-headers-3.2.0-29 linux-headers-3.2.0-29-generic-pae
[06:17] <r4y> I just auto removed them
[06:18] <r4y> Virtual packages like 'google-chrome' can't be removed
[06:19] <r4y> dang, I think I may need to start over from scratch, I was also hoping to get Ubuntu 12 to be like Ubuntu 10 gnome as well but I am just asking for too much lol
[06:19] <r4y> Meaning I added a lot of gnome related packages
[06:19] <r4y> perhaps I messed this up with that
[06:20] <Unit193> Wouldn't really think so, but I'm not a user of chrome or Gnome. :P
[06:21] <r4y> no scatch that I forgot the star
[06:21] <r4y> I really prefer firefox and had Firefox 3.6 with flash 10.03 or was it 10.04 working from a folder
[06:21] <r4y> on Ubuntu 10.04
[06:22] <r4y> OK, un-installed
[06:25] <r4y> Will I need to reboot before checking to see whether online videos will play?
[06:26] <Unit193> Just make sure all browser windows were closed.
[06:26] <r4y> Including Firefox?, because I am using Chazilla right now
[06:27] <r4y> I will be back to make sure
[06:30] <r4y> I need to start over with a certain package. I somehow missed agreeing to something which I think was for Ubuntu restricted extras and I don't remember how but it just happened yesterday night after installing
[06:31] <r4y> Maybe I should ask this question instead, are there videos on youtube that require flash to work and some that don't?
[06:32] <r4y> I read many links on Google and my head is spinning from all I read
[06:32] <Unit193> If you are using HTML5, yep.  http://youtube.com/html5
[06:33] <r4y> How do I find out?, using Firefox?, and or chrome? or?
[06:34] <Unit193> Typically can tell if you right click on the video.
[06:34] <r4y> wait so join the html.5 trial?
[06:34] <Unit193> Up to you.
[06:35] <r4y> h.264 has a ! next to it
[06:42] <r4y> I am petting my cat who normally likes to out so I only have one hand right now
[06:43] <r4y> where would chrome be located in the file system?
[06:44] <r4y> never mind

[15:06] <E3D3> Hi, I try to make a backup of my whole system to a tar on an external drive but because of ext3 it can't grow bigger than 4GB. How can I solve this ?
[15:07] <geirha> ext3 has no such limit. FAT32 does, however
[15:07] <geirha> (ext3 does have a filesize limit, but it's much higher than 4G)
[15:08] <E3D3> Sorry, I think you're right and that my external disk is FAT32
[15:08] <geirha> is formatting it to ext[2-4] an option?
[15:09] <geirha> If you only intend to be using it from Ubuntu, that would be the easy way out.
[15:10] <geirha> Well, linux systems in general
[15:10] <E3D3> No, its a big backup disk, I wanted it compatible with old Windows stuff and choose FAT32 although I have also with video's the same issue
[15:11] <E3D3> Can I make multiple tar's while backupping ?
[15:12] <geirha> Hm. GNU tar (the one on Ubuntu), has a ton of options. There *might* be an option for that.
[15:13] <geirha> Though after a quick perusing of the man-page, I think not.
[15:15] <geirha> Perhaps using a backup-utility, such as the pre-installed deja-dup will be the easiest option then.
[17:06] <Spaxys> Hi, I'm having problems with adobe flash (fullscreen hd on youtube) on Ubuntu 12.04, have tried using HTML5 instead with no improvement. Also reinstalled flash with no improvement. Any suggestions?
[17:07] <Spaxys> Should add that I've got the same problem on both Chromium and Firefox, and using Fluxbox as window manager.
[19:15] <r4y> I am running Ubuntu 12.04 and with youtube a lot of videos are flash so for the setup I have those videos don't work on Firefox but the html5 videos do work. Is there a way to be able to watch both in one browser?, Or at least a way to use one browser for flash videos and the rest that are html5 in another browser?
[19:18] <r4y> For some reason Google Chrome will not play either types of videos, but Firefox 18 will play html5 video but not flash
[19:19] <r4y> I should leave so I can keep experimenting on this, bye
[20:39] <erictheevil> ok, so I am trying to put ubuntu on an old gateway pc built for windows me, currently running xp. p3 1ghz intel 82815 chipset 384 mb ram, any ideas on a good distro to try?
