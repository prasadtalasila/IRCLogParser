[00:09] <timberwolf> I used wine to run EVE Online and when I closed it the cursor locked up and when I logged out and back in the cursor worked until I entered my account, however if I log in with a different user I can use my cursor.
[00:09] <timberwolf> Any ideas?

[00:18] <TheLordOfTime> patience.
[00:19] <timberwolf> is a virtue?
[00:19] <TheLordOfTime> and advised given you're right around new years
[00:20] <timberwolf> I waited 10 minutes before speaking again.
[00:25] <TheLordOfTime> i'm just saying
[00:25] <TheLordOfTime> it can take a LONg time for responses around new years.
[00:25] <TheLordOfTime> give it a day or two, and many'll return ;)
[00:26] <timberwolf> ok
[00:26] <TheLordOfTime> but you usually get a response within an hour or two, but... *shrugs*
[00:27] <timberwolf> I have been at the computer for hours and I will be here hours more
[00:28] <timberwolf> you saying patients fits your nick

[03:10] <Linkmaster> 12.10amd64 install is hanging on "copying installation logs... 93%" I don't know how old the download is, it's rather new though, a couple weeks at most. It installed just fine an hour or so ago, I'm wondering why it's not working now.

[04:48] <Basil1x> 12.10 on a Toshiba L755.  the sound works for a bit, then craps out.  everything insists sound is working, but there is no sound.  bog standard install.  HDMI port is unaffected, is internal speakers only that don't work.  Any help would be appreciated.
[05:07] <phunyguy_t430s> o.O why does rekonq have the NFL website icon where the Facebook icon should be on the tab and in the address bar?  weird...
[05:11] <Basil1x> anyone here know how to fix kubuntu having an issue seeing a sound card?
[05:12] <Basil1x> sound stops after awhile, but thinks it's still working.
[05:17] <hruion> hi
[05:18] <Basil1x> Hello
[05:18] <hruion> en
[05:19] <hruion> my english is poor
[05:19] <hruion> dinn`er to go
[05:20] <hruion> bye
[05:21] <phunyguy_t430s> figured it out.  ~/.kde/cache-{hostname}/favicons has the png stored, so I killed the one labeled www.facebook.com.png - which indeed was the NFL logo for someodd reason.
[05:22] <Basil1x> mebbe facebook 'Like'd NFL?
[05:32] <Dutchman> Basil1x, is the HDMI and system speakers two different devices in the "System Settings > Multimedia > Phonon" setup?
[05:33] <Basil1x> Must be, without the HDMI plugged in, all I see is the internal speakers.  I believe both are controlled by the sound card though.
[05:34] <Dutchman> Are you on the computer now? Can you check?
[05:36] <Basil1x> just a moment... checking now
[05:37] <Basil1x> they seem to be one device
[05:38] <Basil1x> dammit
[05:39] <Dutchman> Hmm... odd. Sometimes I've seen the sound do like you describe when there's two devices, can't say why with just one though.

[07:28] <user94202> I'm having a problem with screensavers not working in kde. I set them to random. But all I get is black screen. Any ideas?
[07:41] <shadeslayer> user94202: did you install screensavers?
[07:43] <shadeslayer> you probably want to install kscreensaver
[07:49] <user94202> shadeslayer:  Yes i fixed the problem by installing kscreensaver.  Now i see them.
[07:50] <user94202> Next problem:  File associations for .wav and .mp3 to open VLC media player, but they keep opening Audacity.
[07:51] <user94202> I want VLC to start when I click a .wav or .mp3
[07:52] <shadeslayer> did you set vlc to a higher priority ?
[07:52] <shadeslayer> it's in System Settings > File associations
[07:52] <user94202> yes i did. But it keeps defaulting back to audacity as the priority.
[07:52] <shadeslayer> hm
[07:53] <shadeslayer> user94202: can you close your file browser and run kbuildsycoca4 and then try opening the file?
[07:53] <user94202> ok..justa moment
[07:57] <user94202> no, kbuildsycoca4 didn't help.  Still opens Audacity.    Can i set the default media player for ALL audio to VLC?
[07:58] <user94202> Actually, set the global setting for media to VLC
[07:58] <shadeslayer> via File Associations, sure, but I don't know of a global setting to do it
=== pete_ is now known as Guest83507
[07:59] <user94202> When I select "audio" in the file associations, it won't allow me to set anything.  I have to set each individual audio file's associations.
[08:00] <shadeslayer> yeah
[08:00] <shadeslayer> can you pastebin your ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
[08:00] <user94202> ok
[08:01] <shadeslayer> I added this to [Added Associations] in mine :
[08:01] <shadeslayer> audio/*=vlc.desktop
[08:01] <shadeslayer> and it seems to work
[08:02] <shadeslayer> heh, nvm, vlc was already taking mp3 mimetypes
[08:04] <user94202> yes, i might need to arrange the priority of that file.
[08:04] <user94202> put vlc first..checking..
[08:06] <user94202> I notice that audacity was first on the list, so i put VLC..  Testing .wav.
[08:06] <shadeslayer> cool
[08:07] <shadeslayer> that shoul ideally work
[08:08] <shadeslayer> user94202: you probably have to run kbuildsycoca4 once you dedit that file
[08:18] <user94202> <still testing....
[08:18] <shadeslayer> ok
[08:19] <user94202> no. That didn't work either.  I'll pastebin that file you wanted.

[08:23] <user94202> Going to reboot.  Clear this mess. Back soon
[08:34] <user94202> I set VLC as default media player, yet it loads Audacity.
[08:35] <user94202> Here's my ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
[08:35] <user94202> http://pastebin.com/6skaGCvx
[08:36] <Wizard> user94202: When does it load Audacity?
[08:36] <Wizard> When clicking on a file?
[08:36] <user94202> yes.. when i click on a .wav file it loads audacity. I want VLC
[08:37] <user94202> in fact i'd like to remove audacity completely from the file associations
[08:37] <user94202> except with audacity's own filetype.
[08:38] <user94202> I just want VLC as the default media player for audio and video.
[08:44] <user94202> OK...i think i got VLC as default.
[08:45] <user94202> I right click the .wav file  >>  properities >> edit filetype >>  VLC
[08:46] <user94202> I suppose i do that to each media file i want to use VLC with.
[08:46] <brent> recently apt-get updated and uprade kubuntu raring. now touchpad settings crash. anyone know how to fix?
[08:48] <user94202> Fixed :-)   Clicking .wav opens VLC.
[08:49] <brent> tried downgrade of kde-config-touchpad. didnt help. anyone?
[08:50] <shadeslayer> brent: looking
[08:50] <shadeslayer> probably it's not ported to python3 or sth
[08:50] <brent> thanks.
[08:51] <brent> oh, i added unity desktop and cinnamon recently. and after update noticed touchpad settings crash in kde
[08:52] <shadeslayer> unrealted, I have the crash on plain kubuntu raring myself
[08:53] <brent> oh well thanks for your time so far.. usually the folks here help sort this stuff out...
[08:54] <brent> OH! i have a seperate synaptics management in the menu uder utilities. the settings launch fine!!
[08:55] <brent> puts a touchpad icon in the sys tray and gives access too settings..
[08:58] <brent> I saw the bug report for the kshell4 touch pad settings crash or whatever.. after original install it crashed. then updated and it worked. and after another update it crashes again...

[19:18] <Ab3L> hi
[19:25] <Ab3L> i have a problem with the clock on the pannel. if you click on it, you'll get space with a calendar of the month on the left and a description on the right. My problem is that the size of the description is too small. Do you know how to make it bigger?
[19:31] <tsimpson> Ab3L: hover over the top right corner of the calendar that pops up, you should then be able to click and drag to adjust its size
[19:32] <Ab3L> oh, yes! it was so simple!
[19:34] <user123456> hey, does kubuntu also have amazon spyware installed or can I safely switch to it?
[19:35] <Ab3L> thank you tsimpson. (i don't know why it haven't worked before. i may have to change the batteries of my mouse...)
[19:35] <tsimpson> user123456: the answer is "no", though neither does ubuntu
[19:36] <tsimpson> Ab3L: it's not that obvious you can do it, but it is the most intuitive way when you think about it
[19:36] <user123456> are you on amazon's payroll?
[19:38] <tsimpson> user123456: no
[19:38] <user123456> just kidding.. but does it also have amazon-shopping-lense installed
[19:38] <tsimpson> no, Kubuntu doesn't have that
[19:38] <user123456> or records any user information by default?
[19:38] <user123456> ok, thank you
[19:39] <Ab3L> sure, i'd tried to enlarge the plasmoid with the mouse (as natural), but it didn't work. i think that's because i've to charge the batteries of the mouse, so that it can handle a long click.
[19:39] <Ab3L> that's the problem with wireless mouses.
[19:40] <Ab3L> the only feature i miss from windows, is an application that shows me the level of the charge of the batteries of my cordless mouse.
[19:40] <Ab3L> :)
