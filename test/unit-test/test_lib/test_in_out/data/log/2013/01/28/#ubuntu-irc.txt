[02:10] <TheLordOfTime> are "Music announce scripts" banned per-channel or globally in all IRCC-controlled channels?
[02:11] <k1l_> does it say something about that specific in the guidelines?
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> i'm asking because i asked someone in #ubuntuforums to disable it and then they give me a fuss over a minor use of capslock *once*
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> then say "you did that without being told to stop, so i'm not going to turn it off"
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> or some other similar stuff
[02:11]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> TBH there's almost no moderation in #ubuntuforums so its probably useless for me mto ask such things
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> (its almost as bad as #defocus was)
[02:12] <k1l_> imho its ok to use them if they are not in a support channel and if its not automatically spamming every song.
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> the case i'm on about is it seems to be announcing each song.
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> which is why i asked them to stop, but...
[02:13]  * TheLordOfTime will take that up with forums council over governance of the channel
[02:14] <k1l_> the guidelines dont say something about that kind of script.
[02:15] <k1l_> but it could be covered by the "dont be annoying" and "dont use scripts or bots" sections.
[02:15] <TheLordOfTime> i think that applies, problem i find is that #ubuntuforums isn't logged afaict.
[02:16] <TheLordOfTime> short of getting FC and IRCC permission to drop a bot in there to log (whether publicly or privately), my statements have no corroboration

[02:17] <TheLordOfTime> i don't think FC likes me constantly pointing out the flaws in the IRC channel though :P
[02:37] <IdleOne> We typically don't allow NP Now Playing scripts in the Ubuntu channels. Ubuntu team/loco channels are free to set their own rules in addition to the !codeofconduct and !guidelines
[02:37] <TheLordOfTime> IdleOne, does #ubuntuforums count as a team/loco channel?
[02:37] <TheLordOfTime> or does it count as IRCC-governed
[02:37] <IdleOne> ubuntuforums is a little special but I would say it is a team channel
[02:38] <IdleOne> All Ubuntu* channels are subject to the IRCC, but the IRCC doesn't lord over them.
[02:39] <IdleOne> So if an issue got to a point where the channel ops couldn't resolve it then it would fall on the IRCC to help resolve it.
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> my point with that was who makes the rules for #Ubuntuforums, and since its FC i'll take it up with them
[02:39] <TheLordOfTime> although !guidelines would still apply, if the guidelines say no bots/scripts
[02:40] <TheLordOfTime> (which i've only ever seen very few exceptions for)
[02:40] <IdleOne> the channel ops make the rules. and all the channels within the Ubuntu namespace are supposed to follow the guidelines and !codeofconduct
