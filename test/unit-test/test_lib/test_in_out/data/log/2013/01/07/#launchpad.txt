[08:02] <shadeslayer> Hi
[08:02] <shadeslayer> Is there a way I can disable build notifications for a particular user in a team?
[08:03] <wgrant> There is not.
[08:04] <shadeslayer> okay

[10:50] <shadeslayer> hi, it seems that this import : https://code.launchpad.net/~blue-shell/kde-baseapps/kde-baseapps : is importing master when I told it to import a specific branch
[10:50] <shadeslayer> "This branch is an import of the HEAD branch of the Git repository at git://anongit.kde.org/kde-baseapps,branch=plasma/isemenov/folderview-qml."
[10:51] <shadeslayer> should I get rid of the "plasma/isemenov" in there?
[10:55] <wgrant> shadeslayer: Are you sure it's actually importing master?
[10:55] <shadeslayer> yep
[10:55] <shadeslayer> seems to be atleast
[10:55] <wgrant> the "HEAD branch" bit is hardcoded UI text from before branches were supported
[10:55] <shadeslayer> lemme double checl
[10:55] <shadeslayer> *check
[10:56] <shadeslayer> https://projects.kde.org/projects/kde/kde-baseapps/repository/changes?rev=plasma%2Fisemenov%2Ffolderview-qml
[10:56] <shadeslayer> as you can see, the last commit is different
[10:57] <wgrant> Oh, I bet the slashes have to be encoded
[10:57]  * wgrant tries
[11:00] <wgrant> shadeslayer: Does that look better?
[11:00] <shadeslayer> yep
[11:01] <shadeslayer> thx wgrant :)
[11:01] <shadeslayer> didn't realize that it needed to be encoded
[11:01] <wgrant> The , bit is technically an attribute of the path segment, not the entirel URL
[11:01] <shadeslayer> ah
[11:02] <wgrant> I'm not quite sure why that didn't fail, though..
[11:50] <vila> hi guys. Just encountered a weird thing: I received an email about bug #885689, went to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntuone-control-panel/+bug/885689 to get the context and... the mail (or rather the corresponding comment) is not there not in the full activity log
[11:50] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 885689 in ubuntuone-control-panel (Ubuntu) "ubuntuone-control-panel does not display my account or options" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[11:50] <vila> s/not in the/nor in the/
[11:51] <vila> the mail was sent 3 days, 16 hours, 24 minutes, 58 seconds ago
[11:52] <czajkowski> vila: one comment has been hidden on there
[11:52] <czajkowski> perhaps why
[11:52] <vila> czajkowski: why I can't see it is still puzzling but well, probably because I'm not in the right team ?
[11:53] <mgz> vila: you're not in launchpad still I take it?
[11:53] <vila> czajkowski: but good enough for me, I will bother other people for access, thank
[11:53] <vila> mgz: hey !
[11:53] <vila> hmm, good question
[11:53] <vila> mgz: but no, I don't think I'm still there
[11:54] <mgz> you probably don't have super-access then
[11:54] <czajkowski> vila: bit of a spam comment tbh
[11:55] <vila> czajkowski: yup, I came to the same conclusion once I saw the bug but was surprised
[11:56] <vila> mgz: not in launchpad anymore, only -beta-testers and -users
[11:57] <vila> mgz: by the way, do *you* still see the reduced diff for additional revisions pushed on a mp ? I don't but can't remember since when
[11:59] <mgz> sec, will double check
[12:00] <czajkowski> mgz: vila welcome back btw :)
[12:01] <mgz> vila: yup, I do, though the first one I tried bugged out on expand :)
[12:01] <vila> czajkowski: thanks :)
[12:02] <vila> mgz: ha ok, so probably team restricted then, too bad, I was so used to it... and keep telling people to push revisions so I can review only the delta... which I can't anymore ;-/
[12:02] <vila> mgz: thanks for checking
[12:02] <mgz> vila: by https://launchpad.net/+feature-rules
[12:02] <mgz> it's only enabled for team:launchpad
[12:03] <vila> two birds with one stone...

[15:57] <dobey> what was the syntax for git non-master branch imports? ";branch=foo" or "?branch=foo" ?
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[16:01] <mgz> dobey: I'd expect comma
[16:03] <mgz> ...not sure it's actually implemented though
[16:36] <yofel> dobey: it's ",branch=foo"

[18:39] <CarlFK> is this an ok place to get some help putting a package on my ppa? I have done it before, thought the script of dbuild/dput stuff worked, but now I get "No host CarlFK-ppa found in config"
=== deryck[lunch] is now known as deryck
[19:13] <maxb> CarlFK: It's an OK place. My guess would be that you previously had custom config to tell dput what "CarlFK-ppa" meant, but no longer have that for some reason
[19:13] <maxb> On a reasonably modern Ubuntu you should be able to just use ppa:<lpusername>/<ppaname> rather than needing custom config
[19:14] <CarlFK> maxb: I vaugly remember a ~/.config file..

[19:35] <dobey> anyone have any idea what might cause the dailydeb issues happening in https://launchpadlibrarian.net/127602321/buildlog.txt.gz ? running dailydeb locally works fine (save for my needed to use debupstream instead of debversion, otherwise it fails immediately on that)
