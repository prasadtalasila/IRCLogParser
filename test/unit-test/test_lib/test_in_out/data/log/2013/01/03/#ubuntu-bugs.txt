[12:49] <llee> how can i automate the generation of logs files? (e.g. the list of files attached in https://bugs.launchpad.net/compiz/+bug/1090897)
[12:49] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1090897 in compiz (Ubuntu) "Segfault on ccsm" [Undecided,Incomplete]
[13:02] <xnox> llee: it's an apport hook.
[13:04] <llee> xnox: noted. i did apport-collect to my another bug id. but, no logs attached. is that expected?
[13:05] <xnox> llee: well it runs the hook for the package, if there is one. If the bug is against the package that has no hooks, only small standard set of information is collected.
[13:07] <llee> xnox: noted. thanks!

[18:22] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, (from -quality) is there anything left to really discuss?  Both sides of the email chain seem to be against the merging, so there's nothing left to do on it?
[18:23] <TheLordOfTime> its pretty much handled as it is, so there's nothing left for that discussion
[18:23]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[18:30] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: yes, but not about joining bugs and quality. I just sent an email about it
[18:31]  * TheLordOfTime has no email access from this system right now
[18:31] <TheLordOfTime> GMail's being evil with my internet right now
[18:31] <TheLordOfTime> (high lag on this network in this region right now)
[18:39] <TheLordOfTime> hggdh, just got access to the email, i agree we have to do something.  suggestions?
[18:40] <TheLordOfTime> because reworking how bugs are handled would take a while.
[18:40] <TheLordOfTime> probably would need a whole time at UDS or some meeting area to discuss it.
[18:57] <hggdh> TheLordOfTime: I think so too. This is why I consider now a good moment to start, and have something more concrete for UDS
[18:59] <hggdh> so, what I am hoping for is that we start the discussion on email, and move from there
[18:59] <TheLordOfTime> we may want to start it under the bugcontrol list
[18:59] <TheLordOfTime> get controller opinions first
[19:14] <hggdh> yes, not a bad idea at all. I will forward my email to -control (and I am sort of amazed I did not do it to begin with)
