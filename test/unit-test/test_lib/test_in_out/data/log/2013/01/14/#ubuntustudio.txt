[06:31] <nishi> Nice to meet you
[06:32] <nishi> ??? aaa...
[06:32] <nishi> what should i do?
[18:53] <animaguy> Hello.
=== _dancer is now known as MOSMarauder

[23:11] <antivapor1> hi! i have two monitors that are mirroring each other. there aren't any alternate options in the display settings,  how do i add those options?
[23:12] <len-1304> under settings look for arandr
[23:14] <antivapor1> got it, have a default setting, what next?
[23:15] <len-1304> If you want it to boot that way go back to setting manager and display and change anything back and forth that wil save it.
[23:16] <len-1304> It 's a bit hacky right now. arandr will save a file that can be fed to xrandr at login too.
[23:17] <antivapor1> do i need to save a second setting or use that script? i currently only have a single 'default' screen shown even though two monitors are connected. :)
[23:18] <antivapor1> and display is same on both
[23:18] <len-1304> arandr should allow you to drag one off the top of the other and position it
[23:20] <antivapor1> http://i.imgur.com/EVvK3.png nobody is beneath it
[23:22] <len-1304> You are right. in arandr  in the outputs pull down menu does it show something that is not enabled?
[23:23] <len-1304> I don't have two monitors to play with. I tested it by bringing my net book and using my desktop monitor for a bit. I'm going from memory.
[23:24] <len-1304> What kind of video are you using? Which driver?
[23:24] <antivapor1> the first drop says 'default' and that has 'active' checked, and then there are also resolution and orientation for output. thanks for testing btw. i suppose i might need a driver, i believe i have an AMD / ATI
[23:24] <antivapor1> ah yes, same thought
[23:24] <len-1304> If you are using the open source driver it should work ok.
[23:25] <len-1304> if you are using the ATI closed source ones then you need the ATI utility to do things.
[23:25] <len-1304> (nvidia is the saem)
[23:25] <len-1304> *same
[23:26] <antivapor1> nope, using open source, but maybe i should get the utility.
[23:26] <len-1304> It looks like X is only seeing one monitor and the IF is just cloning it.
[23:27] <holstein> i had to install the proprietary driver for my nvidia to do dual head
[23:28] <holstein> i should test on my ati hardware, but it really is different from device to device
[23:28] <len-1304> holstein,  I must have been lucky :)
[23:28] <holstein> we cant really have a "how to" that will just work for everyone... its fiddly
[23:28] <holstein> OR, it can be fiddly.. sometimes it just works
[23:28] <len-1304> If xrandr sees it, then things work.
[23:29] <holstein> len-1304: i couldnt seem to get it to "span"
[23:29] <antivapor1> i used lspci -nn  grep VGA to see that I have ATI RS780 [Radeon HD 3200] and  RV620 [Radeon HD 3450], are these the monitors?
[23:29] <len-1304> I'm not sure, I just know I could place the two side by side.
[23:30] <antivapor1> Oh, i think theyre the graphics cards...
[23:30] <len-1304> You have two cards?
[23:31] <antivapor1> I might??
[23:31] <len-1304> You should know :) Did you put a second one in?
[23:31] <holstein> antivapor1: sometimes when im beating my head against the wall, i'll fire up a knoppix live CD (or puppy) configure the dual head, copy the xorg.conf and bring that back to ubuntu and tweak as needed
[23:32] <len-1304> Are both monitors plugged into the same card? Is this a laptop?
[23:32] <holstein> antivapor1: if you look and have 2 graphics cards, then you have 2 graphics cards
[23:32] <len-1304> holstein, cool what do they do different?
[23:33] <antivapor1> no, i didnt put one in, but maybe there was a default one, and then a better one. Both are plugged into same card. I'm dual-booted windows and it works okay there.
[23:33] <holstein> len-1304: knoppix? im not sure, but sometimes it gives me another viable option and an easier place to start
[23:34] <len-1304> Vanilla defaults to side by side these days
[23:34] <holstein> antivapor1: if you dont have the proprietary driver, i would just try that
[23:36] <antivapor1> hmm, i should use fglrx and edit the xorg.conf?
[23:39] <len-1304> I really don't know... It's beyond me.
[23:40] <len-1304> The xsession logs may have some info.
[23:41] <len-1304> /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[23:41] <len-1304> Unplugging the second monitor and seeing what happens and plugging it back in.
[23:42] <len-1304> If the driver is doing anything for the second monitor it should show.

[23:48] <len-1304> So still only screen 0
[23:49] <antivapor1> correct
[23:49] <len-1304> When I plug a second screen in I get two screen sections.
[23:50] <len-1304> The "ignoring this device" seems significant to me
[23:51] <antivapor1> agreed. still looking for how to install amd/ati drivers.. will update soon if i find.
[23:54] <antivapor1> you know where hardware drivers manager is?
[23:58] <lelapin> Hi !
[23:58] <antivapor1> ah, support for my chips were dropped, cause i have 3000 series http://wiki.debian.org/ATIProprietary
