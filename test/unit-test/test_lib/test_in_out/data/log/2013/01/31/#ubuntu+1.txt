[16:17] <ironhalik> Considering the current stage of development, raring works surprisingly well for me
[16:55] <FunnyLookinHat> Anyone else here unable to load Steam?  All of a sudden yesterday, Steam will not load for me...  getting this beauty: /home/funnylookinhat/.local/share/Steam/steam.sh: line 403:  5980 Segmentation fault      (core dumped) $STEAM_DEBUGGER "$STEAMROOT/$PLATFORM/$STEAMEXE" "$@"

[19:13] <FunnyLookinHat> Ok - X has crashed on me multiple times today... but I can't report it... every time I click through the apport screens to report the crash, it crashes again... usually when trying to determine the trace or include the display files
[19:13] <FunnyLookinHat> Any suggestions?  I'd love to be able to supply a valid report.
[19:19] <FunnyLookinHat> heh...
[19:35] <MrChrisDruif> FunnyLookinHat; did you try reporting it through the website? Maybe from a different system? And include the files later?

[19:40] <FunnyLookinHat> MrChrisDruif, I wasn't sure which files to include, or what exactly to put in the report... I usually just let apport do it all for me.
[19:40] <MrChrisDruif> =')
[19:40] <FunnyLookinHat> However - I believe it was an xorg-edgers issue - I've purged the PPA and issue has gone away  :)
[19:40] <MrChrisDruif> Seems legit...
[19:40] <FunnyLookinHat> The beauty of apport - for those of us who want to help but don't have the time to dive through log files... hahha
[19:40] <MrChrisDruif> ;-)
[20:31] <yofel> FunnyLookinHat: note that you could use apport-cli to file a bug from a tty if you don't have X. Or you install openssh-server and file the bug by running apport-cli over ssh from another system
[20:31] <yofel> FunnyLookinHat: btw, you're not the only one without a functional Steam. I haven't yet debugged it though
[20:32] <FunnyLookinHat> yofel, The problem is that - in reporting the bug for X - it was crashing X again... losing my progress.  Is there a way to look up a previous crash and report a bug for that via apport-cli ?
[20:32] <yofel> the crash information is stored in /var/crash/, so you can simply run apport-cli on the .crash file in there
[20:32] <FunnyLookinHat> yofel, it's a bad update - you can get around it with the following:  ~$ STEAM_RUNTIME=0 steam
[20:32] <yofel> oh, yay, thanks :)
[20:32] <FunnyLookinHat> no problem  :)
[20:34] <FunnyLookinHat> here's a related thread in case you want to bump it...  :)   http://steamcommunity.com/app/221410/discussions/0/864958435885593880/

[20:38] <MikeRL> Can someone help me see if this is a bug with X or the kernel?
[20:39] <MikeRL> Help is appreciated. Thanks. By the way, you may need to look at the log files.
