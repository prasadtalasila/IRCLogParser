[06:21]  * S_Mackie tries to read the guidelines, flounders in information overload.
[06:22] <S_Mackie> I have a question, but my head hurts and I'm not sure I have the patience to read all the guidelines. I can't even find anything about how to format my questions!
[06:23] <S_Mackie> My apologies. I think I'll browse the self-help.
[06:25] <Unit193> S_Mackie: http://docs.xubuntu.org/ self help?  Or something else? ;)
[06:35]  * S_Mackie chuckles.
[06:35] <S_Mackie> help.ubuntu.com wasn't giving me much to go on at a glance, but it reminded me of the word GRUB, which is part of my question.
[06:35] <S_Mackie> So that helped a lot.
[06:36] <S_Mackie> Um. So I just partitioned my hard drive with GParted, shrunk the Windows 7 partition and installed Linux in the new partition. NTFS and Ext4, 100g and 50g, respectively.
[06:36] <S_Mackie> Windows works as well as it did before, and the computer freely boots into it. I don't know how to make it boot from the Linux partition, which seems to have a proper file system and all that.
[06:37] <S_Mackie> At present, I don't see anything asking which I wish to boot into, and I feel kinda stupid, because somehow I expected the solution to involve CMOS boot settings.
[06:37] <Unit193> Did you install Grub onto the main boot device/partition?
[06:37] <S_Mackie> No.
[06:37] <S_Mackie> How do I do that?
[06:37] <Unit193> It's in.....
[06:38] <Unit193> !grub
[06:38] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[06:38] <S_Mackie> Gracias!
[06:38]  * S_Mackie frowns.
[06:38] <Unit193> Sure.
[06:39] <S_Mackie> I didn't lose Grub, as I didn't have it on this box as was. Should the RestoreGrub link suffice to help me with this?
[06:39] <Unit193> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing I'd think.
[06:39] <S_Mackie> Haha! That does look promising!
[06:42]  * S_Mackie pouts.
[06:42] <S_Mackie> Yep. I'm reading this and feeling dumb. I can't seem to find a foothold. Which means this is just not my night for being self-directed.
[06:42]  * S_Mackie rereads a bit.
[06:44] <S_Mackie> Correct me if I'm wrong, please: It is very probable there's some manner of GRUB 2 installed on this hard drive, but it's not being called up when I start my computer because it's in the wrong place, most likely because I didn't know how to ask the installation program to set the Linux install I was setting up, in its own new partition, as the OS I wanted the computer to boot into?
[06:45] <S_Mackie> Does that sound about right?
[06:45] <Unit193> Well, normally the installer asks if you want to install grub, but I'd guess it could put it in the wrong location.
[06:46] <S_Mackie> Odd. It didn't ask at all.
[06:46] <S_Mackie> That might explain that.
[06:47] <S_Mackie> I'm reasonably certain I'd've said 'yes,' since I recognized the term GRUB despite being more than a bit of a n00b.
[06:48] <Unit193> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows should in theory be what you have (title isn't the same, but should be the same problem)
[06:49] <S_Mackie> Indeed, it didn't leap out at me as the page for my problem for that reason.
[06:49]  * S_Mackie chuckles.
[06:49] <Unit193> S_Mackie: Another thought, do you have EFI?
[06:49] <S_Mackie> If I do, I'm not wise enough to be aware of it.
[06:50] <S_Mackie> Short answer: Dunno, sorry.
[06:51] <Unit193> http://pix.toile-libre.org/upload/original/1347270285.jpg  That'd be a little more what the boot selection would look like (items marked UEFI)
[06:52] <S_Mackie> Oooh, pretty.
[06:52] <S_Mackie> It doesn't look in the slightest bit familiar, though.
[06:52] <Unit193> Well, I'd either try the RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows or https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI but seems you don't have it. :)
[06:53] <S_Mackie> Even better? Looking at the RecoveringUbuntu bla de bla, I'm trying to follow the instructions and not having a superb extent of luck.
[06:53] <S_Mackie> Hrm. sudo apt-get time?
[06:54] <S_Mackie> Shit.
[06:54] <S_Mackie> I was a n00b when I fell out of touch. Is the Ubuntu Software Center equivalent to the Synaptic Package Manager?
[06:55] <Unit193> Eh, a little more "pretty" and shiny.
[06:55] <WalterN> koegs: seems the issue is UEFI booting?
[06:55] <WalterN> koegs: turned off UEFI and I dont get that error message any more
[06:55] <S_Mackie> I can't find any of several variations on "Boot-Repair" in either Ubuntu Software Center or via sudo apt-get, which means I'm at a loss on how to install it.
[06:55] <WalterN> something is still wrong, but enh, moving forward I think
[06:56] <Unit193> S_Mackie: Sadly, you have to add a ppa...
[06:56]  * S_Mackie blinks dumbly.
[06:56] <Unit193> WalterN: Secure boot enabled?  UEFI doesn't work with 32bit.
[06:56] <S_Mackie> A ppa?
[06:57] <Unit193> S_Mackie: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install boot-repair
[06:57] <S_Mackie> Oh thank you. That's much better.
[06:57] <WalterN> Unit193: secure boot... on the tftp server?
[06:57] <WalterN> or in the EFI settings?
[06:58] <Unit193> Hrm, it appears I missed more than I thought, nevermind me.... In the settings, though.
[06:58] <WalterN> regardless, it is a 64bit netboot
[06:58] <S_Mackie> "UEFI doesn't work with 32bit." Does that mean my 32 bit hardware in this box is not something that will be playing nice with UEFI?
[06:59] <Unit193> 32Bit version of Ubuntu*
[06:59] <S_Mackie> Oh. ... Would there be any reason I'd try to use a 64 bit version of Ubuntu on my 32 bit box?
[07:00] <Unit193> Bug #1025555'
[07:00] <ubottu> bug 1025555 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu32bits is incompatible with EFI computers" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1025555
[07:00] <Unit193> Well, most newer computers should be 64bit, but support 32 of course.
[07:00] <S_Mackie> Mine's just slightly too primitive.
[07:01] <S_Mackie> Hell, I'm running a SBLive! card that just doesn't seem to like Windows.
[07:02] <S_Mackie> So far, so good.
[07:04] <S_Mackie> It gave me a URL, which I've copied down, and I shall now restart my computer and see what happens.
[07:04] <S_Mackie> Thank you, Unit193. I'll be back in some manner.
[07:05] <Unit193> Hope it helps.

[07:06] <WalterN> something like that might be my issue
[07:12] <S_Mackie> So! Partial victory. I now no longer can boot into Windows, but my Windows install was really quite borked anyway.
[07:13] <S_Mackie> A victory in the sense that this is a being run from the Linux partition.
[07:15] <S_Mackie> Now let's see if I can find a page to help me get access to Windows again.
[07:16] <WalterN> woo
[07:16] <WalterN> I win
[07:17] <WalterN> PXE boot HO!
[07:20] <koegs> WalterN: top :)
[07:21] <WalterN> koegs: top what?
[07:25]  * S_Mackie groans.
[07:25] <S_Mackie> Aaaand I get to go back to Boot-Repair.
[07:25] <koegs> WalterN: more like "good to hear"
[07:27] <WalterN> koegs: it must have been something to do with the UEFI on my laptop... *shrug*
[07:27] <WalterN> changed it to 'legacy' insead of UEFI
[07:28] <WalterN> now I just need to think of a name for this... maybe fluttershy or something
[07:36] <S_Mackie> X|
[07:37] <S_Mackie> I've "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update"d, and now I can't seem to get it to run the program.
[07:38] <Unit193> That's because you didn't install it. :)   Also, if trying to add the windows partition, try os-prober?
[07:38] <S_Mackie> os-prober. Okay.
[07:39] <S_Mackie> /dev/sda1:Windows 7 (loader):Windows:chain | /dev/sda2:Windows 7 (loader):Windows1:chain
[07:41] <Unit193> Now sudo update-grub
[07:41] <WalterN> koegs: any reason why PXE would not work with UEFI?
[07:42] <S_Mackie> Huh. Okay.
[07:43] <S_Mackie> Generating grub.cfg ... <br> Found linux image: /boot/vmlinuz-3.5.0-17-generic <br> Found initrd image: /boot/initrd.img-3.5.0-17-generic <br> Found memtest86+ image: /boot/memtest86+.bin <br> Found Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1 <br> Found Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda2 <br> done
[07:43] <S_Mackie> Does that mean it should be fixed now? I confess, I'm a bit lost.
[07:45] <S_Mackie> "Generating" seems like it's a good sign...
[07:49] <S_Mackie> I shall have to test this shortly.
[07:50] <Unit193> Looks good to me. :)
[07:52] <S_Mackie> Boy I hope so, 'cause much as that Windows install has annoyed the jeepers out of me with its constant hanging, and its broad and utter incompatibility with my hardware and peripherals, I still want it to work some day.
[07:52] <S_Mackie> A condition much easier to achieve if I can boot into it.

[15:07] <koegs> nantou: badblocks are hardware errors, you cannot fix them

[18:58] <S_Mackie> So, I installed GRUB and Boot-Repaired it. Windows is seen, Linux boots fine. When I try to boot into Windows, though, it just bounces back to the ram test.
[18:58] <S_Mackie> Why is that? How do I fix it?
[18:59] <holstein> S_Mackie: do you have a few entries for windows?
[18:59] <S_Mackie> Yes. Not sure why.
[18:59] <Unit193> Should have one main entry, then a recovery.
[19:00] <S_Mackie> Not marked accordingly. Sadly, I wasn't smart enough to write down the actual names of the entries.
[19:00] <holstein> S_Mackie: sometimes i just try the others, knowing that one might be "recovery".. being careful not to start that recovery process
[19:00] <holstein> S_Mackie: i dont trust the labels anyways
[19:00] <S_Mackie> I tried both, as they're identical on the face of it.
[19:00] <S_Mackie> They had the same result.
[19:01] <holstein> S_Mackie: was windows 'working" before? did you boot it after shrinking the partition before installing?
[19:01] <S_Mackie> Yes.
[19:01] <S_Mackie> In fact, until I deliberately installed GRUB, the computer still only booted into Windows.
[19:01] <holstein> so, you shrank windows.. booted.. test, and it worked? correct?
[19:02] <S_Mackie> Worked as well (and poorly) as before, yes.
[19:02] <S_Mackie> (Not a Windows joke. It's been giving me no end of trouble.)
[19:02] <holstein> S_Mackie: have you tried to just do it again?
[19:02] <S_Mackie> Just reinstall GRUB again?
[19:02] <S_Mackie> Or do you mean the repartitioning?
[19:02] <holstein> S_Mackie: well, if its been "trouble", this wont fix it.. you could be stumbling onto the larger issue here
[19:03] <S_Mackie> The trouble hasn't ever been in booting, and may have more to do with Adobe and legacy sound cards.
[19:03] <holstein> bad filesystem.. bad hard drive, or memory.. anyways, im talking about reinstalling grub
[19:05] <S_Mackie> I'm almost certain I have a browser tab for that.
[19:06] <S_Mackie> Hrm. Do I use boot-repair for that?
