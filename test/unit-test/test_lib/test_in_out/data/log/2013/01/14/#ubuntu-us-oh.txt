[00:50] <drkokandy> If you want to plan something for sometime Cheri703, please let us know - this week is a nightmare, but next week my schedule gets a lot easier.
[00:52] <Cheri703> ok :) I have a stupid cold at the moment, but hoping it will ease up soon.
[01:02] <drkokandy> that'll give you time to heal up too. Get well!
[02:43] <jrgifford> well, hello from the land of raring.
[03:07] <jrgifford> well, so far raring has been fun.
[03:07] <jrgifford> it's broken tmux once
[03:07] <jrgifford> screen twice
[03:10] <dniMretsaM> jrgifford: sounds great. gotta love development releases
[03:10] <jrgifford> dniMretsaM: this is why i run 'em. :)
[03:11] <jrgifford> they are fun to use
[03:11] <jrgifford> i've got it down to a 30-minute process from time i decide "oh crud it's broken" to the time i've got a working laptop again.
[03:11] <jrgifford> (if i have to do a reinstall)
[03:11] <dniMretsaM> are you using Ubuntu or one of the derivatives (Kubuntu, etc.)?
[03:11] <jrgifford> ubuntu
[03:12] <jrgifford> with gnome-shell installed, because i find gnome-shell works best for presentations
[03:12] <dniMretsaM> I've never been a huge GNOME-Shell fan. what version is in Raring?
[03:13] <jrgifford> not sure
[03:13] <dniMretsaM> I think it might be 3.7/3.8
[03:13] <jrgifford> ok, time to restart and then the proper upgrade will be done. brb
[03:15] <dniMretsaM> hope it still works afterwards
[03:15] <Unit193> Heh, I'm more waiting for Wheezy to go to stable, and the next testing to come out.
[03:19] <jrgifford> dniMretsaM: it works!
[03:19] <jrgifford> so, first thing i noticed
[03:19] <jrgifford> it's faster
[03:19] <jrgifford> unity memory usage is lower
[03:19] <Unit193> jrgifford: Any kernel issues?  You're on 3.8 now.
[03:19] <jrgifford> i'm using 800MB with firefox and the rest of my login applications
[03:19] <jrgifford> Unit193: nope
[03:19] <dniMretsaM> jrgifford: that's great. people will like that when it's released
[03:20] <drkokandy> that sounds great
[03:20] <Unit193> jrgifford: Suspend actually works?
[03:20] <jrgifford> firefox memory usage is lower, definitely
[03:20] <jrgifford> it seems to be a leaner machine.
[03:20] <jrgifford> Unit193: it always has worked for my thinkpad
[03:20] <jrgifford> the HP was another story
[03:20] <Unit193> Bleh, kernel hates me.
[03:21] <dniMretsaM> what version of FF, jrgifford? 19 or 20?
[03:21] <Unit193> Quantal, 3.6 suspend didn't work, 3.7 had glitchy graphics and suspend didn't work.
[03:21] <jrgifford> http://i.imgur.com/rMvQz.png
[03:21] <jrgifford> that's ugly
[03:21] <jrgifford> nautilus is ugly
[03:21] <jrgifford> but what else is new?
[03:21] <jrgifford> oh mannnnn
[03:21] <dniMretsaM> you think so? I actually like Files now
[03:21] <jrgifford> yet another thing for me to override in my screen config
[03:21] <drkokandy> hmmm... it doesn't seem that ugly
[03:22] <jrgifford> s/screen/tmux
[03:22] <jrgifford> alt-arrow keys swaps "windows". used to be sent to the application.
[03:22] <dniMretsaM> it looks a lot cleaner, in my opinion. I tend to like minimalist interfaces
[03:22] <jrgifford> now irssi is broken.
[03:22] <jrgifford> jandrusk_: i may end up learning to live inside an emacs instance
[03:23] <dniMretsaM> ERC ftw
[03:23] <jrgifford> i've been holding off on *really* learning emacs
[03:24] <jrgifford> so, overall: it seems faster
[03:24] <jrgifford> but like all releases, it will lose the new-car speed in the latest 2 weeks before release.
[03:24] <dniMretsaM> I have Emacs open right now
[03:24] <jrgifford> at which point it will get dog slow
[03:25] <dniMretsaM> lol there should be some law about that (like Moore's Law, Murphy's Law, etc.)
[03:25] <jrgifford> yeah
[03:26] <jrgifford> there are occassions.
[03:26] <jrgifford> where i wish i could pin packages at their pre-release state
[03:26] <jrgifford> unity is the big one.
[03:26] <jrgifford> it's always buggy, but fast. and i'm ok with fast and buggy, because the bugs are all cosmetic issues.
[03:27] <jrgifford> then they get all finicky, and it gets cleaned up, but slowed down in the process.
[03:34] <jrgifford> ok, time to learn me some emacs.

[22:13] <thafreak> anyone in here ever do ccna/ccnp (cisco)?
[22:14] <thafreak> might be able to swing a full time faculty position at akron, but would need at least a ccna
[22:14] <thafreak> since the department is part of the cisco academy
[22:14] <thafreak> and i'd end up teaching ccna classes
[22:15] <thafreak> I took the ccna like 10 years ago, but didn't pass...
[22:15] <thafreak> tried to start studying like the weekend before I was scheduled to take it...didn't work out so well

[23:22] <canthus13> I did CCNA years ago.
[23:22] <canthus13> Didn't bother with the test because they changed to 2.0 a week before I was done with the course.
[23:23] <canthus13> thafreak: ...my CCNA instructor works at HOme Depot now.
