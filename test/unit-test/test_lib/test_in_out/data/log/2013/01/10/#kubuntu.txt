[02:52] <rootkit> Hi. I've installed Kubuntu 9.04 (because its all I had and I have no DVDs lying around atm). I grabbed the sources.list from my friends 12.10 install and issued apt-get update and apt-get dist-upgrade and its still 9.04. Did I do something wrong?

[13:14] <BluesKaj> Hi all
[13:23] <userlain> HI BluesKaj
[13:25] <BluesKaj> hi userlain
[13:26] <userlain> What's up?
[13:26] <userlain> What version of Kubuntu are you running?
[13:26] <userlain> Do you need some assistance?
[13:26]  * Wizard 12.04 and 12.10
[13:26] <Wizard> :>
[13:26] <Wizard> I bet BluesKaj doesn't require any assistance :D
[13:29] <Peace-> :S
[13:31] <BluesKaj> userlain,  thanks for the offer , but I'm ok atm :)
[13:33] <BluesKaj> but I do hope the devs can come up with some patches foir the 3,7 kernel otherwise I won't going much further with the kubuntu releases
[13:48] <Wizard> BluesKaj: What's wrong with 3.7 release?
[13:50] <BluesKaj> Wizard, some amd 64 cpu and associated hardware and nvidia graphics card drivers break under the new kernel , or the harware recognititon breaks the install procedure
[13:52] <BluesKaj> In my case I can get to desktop with noapci and nomodeset but ubiquity stalls at the initial install phase if I go any further
[13:54] <BluesKaj> in 13.04 that is ...I tried various kernel install wrappers from some blogs/tutorials for the 3.7 but none of those work for 12.10 either
[13:55] <BluesKaj> on my system at least
[14:00] <yossarianuk> BluesKaj: are you using 13.04 packages or do you just have the 3.7 kernel on an earlier release ?
[14:00] <yossarianuk> For me 3.7 - amd64 and nvidia works on at least 3 systems
[14:00] <BluesKaj> yossarianuk, I tried both
[14:00] <yossarianuk> (different systrems)
[14:01] <yossarianuk> are you installing the driver from nvidia or a package ?
[14:01] <yossarianuk> (i.e apt-get the driver or the nvidia binary)
[14:01] <BluesKaj> tried the 3.7 kernel on 12.10 and 1304 uses the 3.7 kernel as default
[14:01] <yossarianuk> bodhi linux uses kernel 3.7 by default and works on all 3 systems I have
[14:02] <yossarianuk> One has a geforce 6000
[14:02] <yossarianuk> on a 8500
[14:02] <yossarianuk> one a gts 450
[14:02] <yossarianuk> all fine
[14:02] <BluesKaj> mine is a 8400gs
[14:03] <yossarianuk> have you tried to install the driver manually ? - i.e not the normal ubuntu package ?
[14:03] <yossarianuk> ps you shoudl
[14:03] <yossarianuk> *should file a bug report*
[14:06] <BluesKaj> yossarianuk, i filed a bug repoort on launchpad , but it isn';t getting much attn
[14:06] <yossarianuk> if its not working try to install driver manually (i.e binary from nvidia.com)
[14:07] <yossarianuk> (make sure you remove the one installed now)
[14:07] <BluesKaj> bug 1089439
[14:07] <ubottu> bug 1089439 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Kubuntu 13.04 AMD 64 Desktop Daily Build install freezes at hardware scan" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1089439
=== kubuntu is now known as Guest56575
[14:14] <yossarianuk> that doesn;t seem related to nvidia
[14:14] <yossarianuk> but hope you get progress
[14:20] <BluesKaj> yossarianuk, to some degree it is , it just doesn't seem so when one tries to install from the live -dvd because ubiquity stalls in the text mode at the keyboard hardware scan
[14:21] <BluesKaj> later I found out that if one uses nomodeset etc to get to the desktop as others have they encounter the nvidia driver problems afterwards
[14:24] <BluesKaj> I didn't add to the bug about nvidia because I don't get far enough to recreate the errors

[14:33] <kamajii> why does it take hours to trust a root certificate using Kleopatra..?
[14:37] <Wizard> kamajii: Explain :)
[14:37] <kamajii> Wizard: basically, I'm running Ubuntu, with removed gnome and added KDE
[14:38] <kamajii> Wizard: freshly set-up. I then installed Kleopatra, including its dependencies to the gpg-agent and all the other S/MIME related packages.
[14:38] <Wizard> So? KDE is KDE, no matter how you installed it.
[14:39] <Wizard> What do you mean by "takes hours to trust root cert"
[14:39] <kamajii> Wizard: I hope so. Just wanted to mention it's not actually *K*Ubuntu
[14:39] <kamajii> anyway, starting Kleopatra fails because the gpg-agent is not running.
[14:39] <Wizard> If you want actuall kubuntu, you may install kubuntu-desktop package ;)
[14:40] <Wizard> This will change boot splash and other useless crap and install tons of software.
[14:40] <kamajii> Thus, I generated the ~/.gnupg directories by running 'gpg' and then I added a 'use-agent' line to the gpg.conf, so the agent gets started
[14:40] <kamajii> I figured that out by inspecting the startup scripts for X11, seems to be a bug, somehow.
[14:41] <kamajii> (thanks, I'll stick to a slim Ubuntu+little KDE :-))
[14:41] <kamajii> restarting X11 then also starts the gpg-agent, making Kleopatra to pass all its self-tests and start up.
[14:42] <kamajii> I then imported a certificate (CAcert, in case it matters)
[14:42] <kamajii> a message box pops up, stating that two certs have been imported. Closing this box triggers two progress bars in Kleopatra
[14:43] <kamajii> one for listing GPG certificates and another for listing X.509 certificates
[14:45] <kamajii> sorry, forgot one step. The certificates appear in the list widget after closing the dialog box. Then, right-clicking on the root certificate and picking 'trust root certificate' from the context menu triggers the progress bar. Sorry for that
[14:45] <kamajii> anyway, the latter bar (listing X.509 certificates) takes a quarter of an hour to complete...
[14:46] <kamajii> Wizard: I can hardly figure out what makes it got stuck so long.
[14:46] <Wizard> Does it produce any logs?
[14:46] <Wizard> Maybe check .xsession-errors
[14:46] <Wizard> I'm not a Kleopatra specialist.
[14:47] <kamajii> does not produce obvious logs, at least not on stderr/stdout
[14:48] <Wizard> :(
[14:48] <Wizard> Maybe somebody on #kde will have some explanation.
[14:51] <kamajii> I'll give it a try :-)
[14:52] <Wizard> Sorry I couldn't help.
[14:53] <kamajii> no problem.
[14:53] <faulk2p> check out the #linux there are more people in that room that might be able to help
[14:54] <Wizard> Uh, that is a troll cave :D
[14:55] <kamajii> all that crappy akonadi/nepomuk drives me crazy.
[14:58] <BluesKaj> you can turn them off kamajii
[15:00] <kamajii> BluesKaj: sure, but then KMail cannot search for emails anymore and so on...
[15:00] <BluesKaj> interesting that the COC doesn't apply to all the chats on freenode ..it's up to the individual ops to set the rules
[15:02] <BluesKaj> kamajii, unless you need a real large email database then kmail is important , if you don't them kmail can be replaced with something that works well , like thunderbird
[15:02] <BluesKaj> them=then
[15:03] <kamajii> I always liked Kmail because it was slim, fast, simple
[15:03] <BluesKaj> heh
[15:03] <BluesKaj> really ?
[15:03] <kamajii> in contrast to the all-overwhelming Thunderbird...
[15:03] <kamajii> yes, KMail in KDE3 was just perfect
[15:04] <BluesKaj> agreed but the PIM now makes kmail clunky and unfriendly and crashy on my system
[15:05] <kamajii> exactly.
[15:05] <BluesKaj> thunderbird is not overwhelming ..it works like a charm for home users like me
[15:05] <kamajii> what I simply cannot figure out is: I configured everything, including the S/MIME in Kleopatra and it worked for weeks.
[15:06] <kamajii> this morning I booted the box and it was broken for no obvious reason. No updates have been installed or so
[15:07]  * BluesKaj doesn't know anything about kleopatra and doesn't need or worry about certificates

[15:29] <BluesKaj> azrael_, suggest you try #ubuntu chat , there a quite few more wifi gurus there
[15:29] <BluesKaj> are
[15:30] <azrael_> BluesKaj: Thanks, I'll try there

[15:39] <ubottu> fern-again: No warez here! This is not a file sharing channel (or network); read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».

[15:47] <BluesKaj> azrael_, describe the errors
[15:50] <azrael_> BluesKaj: I've no errors really! Simply I can't view any connection unless I'm very close to the AP/router! When I get distance form it the signal disappears and I lost the connection. I've found out that this problem is common for this adapter, but I didn't manage to solve it.
[15:51] <BluesKaj> azrael_, perhaps a different channel on the router like ch 9 ...6 seems to be the default for all OSs
=== pjoe_dj is now known as pjoe_afk
[15:52] <BluesKaj> and if you have router broadcast power settings , make them higher
[15:53] <azrael_> BluesKaj: This problem makes my laptop useless and I can't change the AP channel of every router I've to connect to... That's not the right solution I think
[15:55] <BluesKaj> azrael_, sorry to hear that , the broadcast on your laptop chip is obviously weak , there must be a metod to increase it's coverage
[15:56] <azrael_> BluesKaj: I've heard that some Atheros ar9285 users solved this problem intalling the compat wireless driver, but the last version seems not to be the solution too...
[15:59] <BluesKaj> azrael_, which model laptop ?

[16:01] <azrael_> BluesKaj: That's new too and It's very depressing discover this type of problems :P
[16:04] <BluesKaj> azrael_, did the wifi chip work ok when you installed kubuntu ?
[16:05] <azrael_> BluesKaj: What do you mean? It's always worked in this way of course...
[16:06] <BluesKaj> azrael_, ok , I thought you had installed a different ubuntu driver than the default
[16:07] <azrael_> Yes... I've try to install the compat-wireless driver, but then I uninstalled it because the results wasn't changed...
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[16:09] <BluesKaj> azrael_, did you blacklist the the default driver after installing the compat-wireless driver ? if not then the compat driver wasn't working
[16:12] <azrael_> BluesKaj: Mh... You're right, in this moment I can't remember if I was wrong really... I'm going to retry... I'll give you the resoult of the operation in 2 minutes :)
[16:16] <azrael_> BluesKaj: Checked... I think I needn't to blacklist the old driver or load some others modules... There's nothing like this written in README of the compat-wireless driver! I'm wrong?

[16:20] <howudodat> I have 12.10 running 64 bit with a linksys WMP600N. I believe this is the same as ralink 2860. The ralink2800pci driver is being loaded and is painfully slow (i dont seem to drop network connection, but I cant stream audio from my NAS).  I have followed the suggestion here:http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1958059 and attempted to build the driver, but they dont work for kernels > 3.0 and it hard freezes my computer when I insm

[19:01] <UberDuper> Can someone check to see the keyboard shortcut to turn it back on?
[19:02] <shadeslayer> Ctrl+M
[19:02] <shadeslayer> ahhh .... I still remember the first time I did this myself

[19:02] <shadeslayer> yeah
[19:02] <shadeslayer> hmm
[19:02] <shadeslayer> UberDuper: care to file a bug against that?
[19:03] <UberDuper> One of the things that still drives me nuts about the various linux desktop envs is the lack of consistency in shortcuts.
[19:03] <shadeslayer> inconsistent behavior
[19:03] <UberDuper> I should start submitting bug reports. But I think people would just get mad at me.
[19:03] <shadeslayer> not really
[19:03] <shadeslayer> seems like a genuine issue to me
[19:03] <UberDuper> I have a lot of issues. :/
[19:04]  * shadeslayer is all ears
[19:04] <shadeslayer> but I'm afraid I'll be slow in responding :P

[19:05] <UberDuper> Took me a while to find another app that actually lets me disable the menu bar.
[19:06] <shadeslayer> heh
[19:06] <UberDuper> Most of my other problems are likely nvidia related.
[19:07] <shadeslayer> can't help there I'm afraid
[19:07] <UberDuper> Running the latest 310.19 driver, if you disable compositing via the shortcut or w/e, when you turn it back on, I think it's kwin starts chewing up a lot of cpu and the graphics are just wonky.
[19:07] <UberDuper> I don't think this happened with 310.14
[19:08] <UberDuper> I'm probably gonna revert.. I only installed 310.19 trying to fix the vsync issues.
[19:08] <UberDuper> (didn't help)
[19:08] <shadeslayer> need to logout
[19:08] <shadeslayer> bbiab
[19:11] <soee> UberDuper, i must say i have more problems with latest drivers than benefits
[19:11] <UberDuper> Yeah I'm gonna revert.
[19:11] <UberDuper> I have to disable compositing for wine games.
[19:12] <UberDuper> Another issue I have that I haven't tested with the new driver yet..
[19:12] <UberDuper> Some of the compositing effects like the app flipper don't show up in the center of the screen.
[19:13] <UberDuper> I've got a 4 monitor setup and the flipper pops up completely off the screen.
[19:13] <UberDuper> I need to play around with it and some of the nvidia xinerama/etc settings. Maybe I can find a combination that works.
[19:15] <jeroen-> With Gnome (Ubuntu) I used Deja-dup as backup tool. It's backend is Duplicity, a command line tool. Is there any reliable KDE client for Duplicity. I've found time-drive, but last update is from 2010. If there not a good duplicity-client, wat is the best KDDE backup tool for desktop users?

[19:47] <shadeslayer> rsync
[19:47] <shadeslayer> which is what I use :)
[19:47] <UberDuper> tar
[19:47] <Torch> ack. people recommend unison, but i haven't tried it
[19:47] <yofel> rsync, or rdiff-backup if you need history
[19:48] <UberDuper> Clicking respond to a new telepathy conversation notification does nothing for me.
[19:48] <UberDuper> No new tab/window is created either. I have go to into my contact list and start a chat with the person to see their message.
[19:50] <jeroen-> shadeslayer: UberDuper Torch yofel: It is just for a desktop backup to an external drive,
[19:52] <shadeslayer> yeah just setup a cronjob

[20:04] <UberDuper> The screens are setup and work. Getting their positioning right was a nightmare. The issues that remain are tearing and odd placement of some things. Like the flipper.

[20:07] <UberDuper> I'll tinker with some of the nvidia options before I go that route.
[20:07] <UberDuper> I've just disabled those effects for now.
[20:10] <Scunizi> I'm trying to setup my wacom Graphire 4 on my system with dual monitors.  I've loaded the appropriate driver and the tablet shows in System Settings > Graphic Tablet. I have 2 issues I need to resolve. 1> Getting the pen to function on only one screen at a time 2> whenever I use the pen for some reason the keyboard is no longer recognized and I have to kill the program I used the pen with (xournal). Any hints, suggestions, solutions?
[20:18] <m477> where can I set change that I dont wnat to see windows fro  other desktop on a bar?
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
[20:28] <musca> m477: just right click on the bar, choose settings
[20:29] <m477> ok I found thx
[20:42] <BarkingFish> Evening guys :)  Anyone here have any inkling as to when the last version of kubuntu was, which supported type 1 ID3 tags, please?

[21:40] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: could you be more specific?
[21:41] <BarkingFish> sbivol_, sure
[21:42] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: I suspect you need to find something about a certain audio player or metadata editor...
[21:42] <BarkingFish> I need to get hold of the old ID3v1 tag library to use with Audacity - i'm exporting some music which is going to be used on old equipment which doesn't support ID3v2, so all the metadata won't show on the player.
[21:42] <sbivol_> ah...
[21:42] <BarkingFish> I need to know which kubuntu was the last one which had the old libid3tag library which supported version 1 tags
[21:45] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: since Hardy it's version 0.15.1b, unchanged to this day
[21:46] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: so you need a version of kubuntu released before 2008
[21:46] <BarkingFish> right, so I need to go pre-hardy
[21:49] <BarkingFish> Damn. I hope I can find an ISO for Gutsy :)
[21:49] <BarkingFish> I don't know anyone who'd have one.
[21:49] <yofel> http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/ has all
[21:50] <BarkingFish> woohoo :P
[21:50] <BarkingFish> thanks yofel :)
[21:50] <yofel> but I only see 0.15.1b in the pool
[21:50] <yofel> 0.15.1b-1 dating back to 09-Jun-2004
[21:50] <yofel> so you might need an OLD DEBIAN release
[21:51] <BarkingFish> that's annoying. No Gutsy release of Kubuntu available.
[21:51] <BarkingFish> Goes from Hardy back to Drake
[21:54] <yofel> hm. From a quick look at libid3tag it seems to still support v1 tags
[21:55] <yofel> are you sure that Audacity knows how to write v1 tags?
[21:55] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: http://archive.debian.net/woody/libs/libid3tag0
[21:55] <yofel> or even tries to?
[21:56] <BarkingFish> yofel, as far as I'm aware it does.
[21:56] <BarkingFish> I might go back through the mists and find an old beta version of Audacity and have a shot from there.
[22:00] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: may the force be with you in your journey to the pre-Ubuntu ages...
[22:01] <BarkingFish> I have a lot of old ISOs here of linux distros long since consigned to history.
[22:03] <BarkingFish> The oldest one I think is Mandrake 7.0, I also have FC2 and FC3 in my box of goodies somewhere...
[22:04] <BarkingFish> and one of the first releases of Knoppix :)
[22:07] <UberDuper> I think I have freebsd 2.2.6 media somewhere.
[22:07] <BarkingFish> 0.0
[22:08] <BarkingFish> The earliest knoppix release in my kit is 1.6
[22:10] <UberDuper> I had windows 1.0 floppies at one point.
[22:10] <UberDuper> When I was like.. 10.
[22:11] <BarkingFish> damn.
[22:12] <BarkingFish> I had windows for workgroups 3.1.1 at some long forgotten point in the past, but anyway - this is offtopic :)  Shall we take this elsewhere?

[22:15] <Timberwolf> How do you clear the open with list for a certain file type?
[22:15] <Timberwolf> reset it to default
[22:15] <shadeslayer> hmm
[22:16] <BarkingFish> Timberwolf, find a file of that type - right click the icon and go down to properties
[22:16] <shadeslayer> Timberwolf: try mv ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list.bak && kbuildsycoca4
[22:17] <BarkingFish> when the properties open, you will see a small spanner on the first tab, click it
[22:17] <shadeslayer> afaik the file association order is stored in mimeapps.list
[22:17] <shadeslayer> and renaming that to something else should work
[22:17] <BarkingFish> the next box which pops up contains the "Application preference order"
[22:17] <licious> hy
[22:17] <shadeslayer> BarkingFish: doing that for each file is tedious :P
[22:17] <licious> i have one question about the softwear center in kubuntu
[22:17] <shadeslayer> s/file/file type/
[22:18] <BarkingFish> you can remove individual applications from that list, if you don't want them to appear in the "Open with list"
[22:18] <Timberwolf> that worked
[22:18] <shadeslayer> Timberwolf: which one? :P
[22:18] <Timberwolf> properties
[22:18] <shadeslayer> ah ok
[22:18] <shadeslayer> I thought you wanted to reset them all
[22:18] <licious> how do i get it
[22:18] <BarkingFish> shadeslayer, people ask a question, i teach them what I know. Tedious or not, if it works, i use it
[22:18] <Timberwolf> no just one
[22:19] <BarkingFish> i don't tell people to move stuff when I have no idea what I'm instructing them to move, for the record :)
[22:21] <Timberwolf> my open with for shell scripts was messy
[22:25] <Timberwolf> got one more question: if you have 3 repos with the exact same package, how to you specify which one to download from?
[22:25] <Timberwolf> from command line
[22:36] <shadeslayer> Timberwolf: either specify the version or do apt pinning>
[22:36] <shadeslayer> you can also do this via muon I think
[22:38] <shadeslayer> night
[22:39] <BarkingFish> sbivol_, i just checked in apper - id3v2 in kubuntu will convert and list id3v1 tags, but not write them by the looks of it
[22:46] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: too bad... apparently, libid3tag ever had only two versions: 0.15.0 and 0.15.1
[22:47] <BarkingFish> it's ok - i'm saved.
[22:47] <BarkingFish> i found an editor in KDE which will still edit id3v1.1 tags and save them to files :)
[22:47] <sbivol_> which one?
[22:47] <BarkingFish> !info Kid3
[22:47] <ubottu> Package Kid3 does not exist in quantal
[22:48] <BarkingFish> oh yes it does :)
[22:48] <DarthFrog> I like Easytag for ID3 editing.
[22:48] <BarkingFish> There's Kid3 and Kid3-qt which both work nicely for this.
[22:53] <sbivol_> !info kid3
[22:53] <ubottu> kid3 (source: kid3): KDE MP3 ID3 tag editor. In component universe, is optional. Version 2.1-2 (quantal), package size 692 kB, installed size 2129 kB
[22:54] <sbivol_> \o/ this was my first Irc Fu command :-)
[22:58] <BarkingFish> congratulations :)  I've been doing IRC fu for years with different bots, and I still make a balls of it :)
[23:00] <x1000_nemo> #join lubuntu
[23:01] <sbivol_> BarkingFish: I started using IRC a week ago, so it's all new to me
[23:02] <Timberwolf> When I run apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree, I got Package flashplugin-nonfree is a virtual package provided by:     adobe-flashplugin 11.2.202.261-0quantal1      flashplugin-installer:i386 11.2.202.261ubuntu0.12.10.1       flashplugin-installer 11.2.202.261ubuntu0.12.10.1      You should explicitly select one to install.
[23:02] <Timberwolf> and I'm not sure how. I looked at the apt pinning
[23:02] <Timberwolf> but I don't know the url
[23:03] <Timberwolf> I want the first one
[23:04] <gorgonizer> Timberwolf: you should be able to apt-get install adobe-flashplugin  I would imagine, if that is the one you wish to use..
[23:04] <boot> going to muon package manager, search and install should be straight forward
[23:04] <shadeslayer> I actually install flashplugin-installer
[23:05] <gorgonizer> shadeslayer: same here..
[23:05] <shadeslayer> !flash
[23:05] <ubottu> To install Flash see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/Flash - See also  !Restricted and !Gnash
[23:05] <shadeslayer> yep, recommended way is flashplugin-installer ^
[23:05] <Timberwolf> I am using flash-aid
[23:05] <Timberwolf> and gnash doesn't work right
[23:06] <shadeslayer> don't even know what that is
[23:06] <Timberwolf> flash-aid?
[23:06] <shadeslayer> yeah
[23:06] <Timberwolf> its a firefox plugin
[23:06] <shadeslayer> I see
[23:07] <boot> never heard of flash-aid, is it any good?
[23:07]  * shadeslayer uses chrome
[23:07] <shadeslayer> comes with it's own flash plugin
[23:08] <boot> ha, i see what it does...
[23:09] <Timberwolf> I have had luck with it in the past
[23:09] <gorgonizer> Timberwolf: trying it now..
[23:10] <Timberwolf> the adobe beta for 64 bit is a broken link
[23:10] <dogan> hi
[23:10] <dogan> türk varmı  loooooooooo
[23:10] <dogan> merhaba
[23:10] <dogan> geve
[23:10] <dogan> gece gece
[23:11] <bond__> Does anybody here know about how to check what is the TCP initial window size taken by kubuntu?
[23:12] <gorgonizer> Timberwolf: yeah, found that out ;)... would appear that I will have to go back to flashplugin-installer for 64bit flash, oh well..
[23:12] <dogan> what up man
[23:12] <dogan> whats up man
[23:14] <sbivol_> boot: I'm using Flash-aid, it's excellent
[23:15] <Timberwolf> I GOT IT TO WORK!!!!!
[23:15] <Timberwolf> If you use custom location with this url: http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/pdc/11.2.202.261/install_flash_player_11_linux.x86_64.tar.gz
[23:16] <Timberwolf> now my flash works great!
