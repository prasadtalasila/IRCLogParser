[09:09] <arune> karni: works! thanks!
[09:10] <arune> karni: do you know where the problem was?
[09:18] <JamesTait> Good morning all! :-D
[09:20] <mandel> morning!
[09:44] <nrosvall> Hi
[09:45] <nrosvall> Is there c++ API for ubuntuone? I can only find one for Python from developer.ubuntu.com
[10:42] <mandel> nrosvall, witch os?
[10:42] <mandel> nrosvall, and what exactly do you want to do?
[10:42] <nrosvall> Ubuntu and well something like this http://developer.ubuntu.com/resources/app-developer-cookbook/ubuntu-one/adding-ubuntu-one-files-support-to-your-app/
[10:45] <mandel> nrosvall, hm... I see, all that is exposed over dbus but we never wrote a 'client api' in anyother lang (the python example is importing from the u1 project directly)
[10:46] <mandel> nrosvall, I think I can help you with that, what c++ framework are you using?
[10:46] <nrosvall> QT
[10:47] <mandel> nrosvall, awesome! hehe just what I was hoping for, writing c++ wrappers with Qt for the dbus methods is not hard, but very very tedious...
[10:48] <mandel> nrosvall, I might be able to write some during the weekend... or even earlier
[10:50] <nrosvall> oh that would be awesome
[10:50] <mandel> nrosvall, can you let me know witch methods you are interested in? that way I can start with those and that way I wont block you
[10:50] <nrosvall> no hurry though, Im just starting. im a long time windows developer and pretty much moving to develop software for Ubuntu
[10:51] <nrosvall> but it really would be nice to have some qt dbus examples for ubuntu one
[10:52] <mandel> nrosvall, well, dbus in qt is a little annoying sometimes, ideally we would want a wrapper that performs the call to dbus in an async manner and uses a pending call watcher to emit a signal when done, that way the app will never block for possible slow requests
[10:53] <nrosvall> hmm I guess I could just use some rest client with c++
[10:54] <mandel> nrosvall, the rest client is not as good to me hones, best way is to talk to the daemon directly, I can deal with the dirty ugly details :)
[10:54] <nrosvall> yeah :)

[10:59] <gatox> good morning!
[10:59] <mandel> gatox, buenas! o/
[11:01] <mandel> gatox, I have been thinking, maybe you have had problems with unity compilation due to the new pre-compiled headers feature that was added to speed up the compilation times
[11:01] <mandel> gatox, have you tried disabling it?
[11:01] <gatox> mandel, aja! jeje nop.... how do i do that?
[11:02] <mandel> gatox, there was an internal mail sent to canonical tech telling how to do it.. are you in that list?
[11:02] <gatox> mandel, ahhhh right...... i'll look it up
[11:02] <gatox> found it.......
[11:02]  * gatox reading....
[11:03] <mandel> gatox, do you have the problems with trunk?
[11:03] <gatox> mandel, nop
[11:04] <mandel> gatox, care to pastebin the error?
[11:04] <gatox> the nop was for problems with trunnk
[11:04] <mandel> gatox, so you have no problems with trunk you say?
[11:04] <mandel> gatox, but with my branch?
[11:04] <gatox> mandel, yes
[11:05] <mandel> gatox, lets do this in private to reduce the noise here :)
[11:26] <nantou> chaselivingston,
[11:30] <nantou> anyone?
[11:35] <beuno> nantou, what's up?
[11:35] <nantou> its about my non working ubuntuone account
[11:36] <nantou> chaselivingston, was trying to help me yesterday, but I had to go
[11:36] <beuno> nantou, it's a bit early for chaselivingston, he'll be here in a couple of hours
[11:36] <nantou> are you an admin beuno ?
[11:36] <beuno> nantou, sort of maybe. What problem are you having?
[11:37] <nantou> thunderbird and the regular ubuntu one directories dont share the same data
[11:37] <nantou> I am missing 1.2 GB of data
[11:37] <nantou> email: andersen75@tormail.org
[11:38] <beuno> nantou, I assume chaselivingston recovered the deleted folders for you?
[11:38] <nantou> beuno, we didnt talk that much, I have no idea
[11:39] <nantou> im signing in again to see what happens
[11:39] <beuno> rye, ping?
[11:39] <beuno> nantou, you were syncing the thunderbird folder?
[11:39] <beuno> it doesn't look like you were syncing anything
[11:39] <rye> beuno: pong
[11:40] <beuno> rye, can you take over here?
[11:40] <rye> reading
[11:40] <beuno> thanks
[11:40] <nantou> beuno, hoiw much data do I have at the moment? 9MB or 1.2 GB?
[11:40] <beuno> nantou, 0 bytes
[11:40] <rye> nantou: i'll take it from here
[11:40] <nantou> ok...
[11:41] <rye> nantou: sorry, were you discussing the issue with chase here or in a support ticket?
[11:41] <nantou> the former
[11:43] <rye> nantou: ok, so at the moment the admin interface shows that account "andersen75@tormail.org" has 0 bytes, it does not have a UDF for thunderbird attachments so it looks like you have another account with us, you mentioned that it uses an old e-mail, what is the new one?
[11:43] <rye> nantou: or if it was a new e-mail address, what is the older one
[11:43] <nantou> andersen75 is the new one
[11:43] <nantou> hihihi100@live.com is, was the old one
[11:44] <nantou> you may delete it if you wish
[11:44] <nantou> "syncing the cloud to your computer" the ubuntuone interface has been like that for 6 minutes already, ain't that too much?
[11:45] <rye> nantou: ok, that account is where the 1.3Gb of data are (hihihi one). Ok, as I understand you have created a different account for a new e-mail which is most likely not what you wanted
[11:45] <nantou> file sync error, local and server roots are different, ROOT MISMATCH
[11:45] <nantou> rye, please delete account "hihihi100", I will re upload it all to the new one
[11:47] <rye> nantou: here's the entry about root mismatch - https://one.ubuntu.com/help/faq/what-does-the-root_mismatch-error-mean/
[11:48] <rye> nantou: what you will want to do is to back up all the Ubuntu One data you have (take it away from Ubuntu One directory), shut down ubuntuone - u1sdtool --quit and remove ~/.local/share/ubuntuone  directory
[11:48] <nantou> ok...
[11:49] <nantou> rye, --> u1sdtool --quit and remove ~/.local/share/ubuntuone <-- is the actual command, right?
[11:50] <rye> nantou: command - u1sdtool --quit
[11:50] <rye> nantou: after that command completes, you may remove ~/.local/share/ubuntuone directory
[11:51] <rye> nantou: after this you can start ubuntuone again - u1sdtool --start and put files back into Ubuntu One directory
[11:51] <nantou> i have executed "u1sdtool --quit", ubuntuone-syncdaemon stopped.
[11:52] <nantou> now I am going to execute "u1sdtool --remove ~/.local/share/ubuntuone"
[11:53] <rye> nantou: uhm, no, "rm ~/.local/share/ubuntuone" is what you will want but you can also rename the ~/.local/share/ubuntuone directory (e.g. mv ~/.local/share/ubuntuone ~/.local/share/_ubuntuone
[11:53] <rye> )
[11:53] <nantou> rm: cannot remove `/home/dexter/.local/share/ubuntuone': Is a directory
[11:53] <nantou> sudo?
[11:55] <mandel> nantou, no, use rm -Rf and the dir
[11:56] <mandel> nantou, I bet you forgot the -R, right?
[11:56] <nantou> Ill be off for an hour, a student came in
[11:56] <nantou> possibly
[11:56] <nantou> tsch√ºss
[11:56] <rye> nantou: ah, sorry, yes,  -rf for rm, but mv is ok
[13:05] <nantou> lesson is over im back
[13:06] <nantou> I have executed rm -Rf ~/.local/share/ubuntuone
[13:06] <nantou> do I look good to go?
=== eu is now known as Guest7017
[13:09] <karni> arune: We haven't identified the exact problem yet, all I can say it was an issue on the server. We rolled back, so that users don't suffer from this problem.
[13:10] <nantou> rye, how does my account look now? im syncing
[13:12] <nantou> can any admin tell me how bad/good does my account look?
[13:13] <rye> nantou: 17Mb used now
[13:14] <rye> nantou: and growing
[13:14] <nantou> no trace of the old hihihi100 one?
[13:15] <rye> nantou: we are not yet able to completely delete the accounts. I will need to get an update about what's the priority for account removal implementation
[13:27] <nantou> a...
[13:33] <arune> karni: ok, then probably not only I was affected I assume
[13:34] <karni> arune: Exactly. This is why I appreciated your cooperation so much :)
[13:34] <arune> karni: let me know if you need more help in this issue, testing a new version etc
[13:35] <karni> arune: We've decided on the solution that we know also works elsewhere, so we're good. Thank you :)!
