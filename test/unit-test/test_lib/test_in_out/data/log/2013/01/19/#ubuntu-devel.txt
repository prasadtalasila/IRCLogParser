[01:09] <cjwatson> zobel: Ubuntu modifications are not hijacks
[01:25] <xnox> cjwatson: yeah, we agreed on that in private =)
[01:26] <cjwatson> OK, but I want it to be clear for others reading so that there isn't a chilling effect
[01:31] <mlankhorst> cjwatson: well do you need me for anything still? I cold do a precise3 for enabling gallium, but would rather test on monday
[01:32] <cjwatson> mlankhorst: No, fine for now, thanks - I'll dribble in those rebuilds over the next day or so
[01:32] <mlankhorst> kk
[02:26] <infinity> Dearest apport:  WTF?  Why did you suddenly start opening chromium when firefox is my default browser?
[02:29] <infinity> Hrm, because the sensible-browser alternative is wrong.  Irksome.

[11:29] <geser> cjwatson: for libimobiledevice: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1548738/ It looks like the patch for cython >= 0.16 (already included in the package) missed to remove one "inline" (it removed the inline from the .pyx file but not from the .pxd file which acts as a header)
[11:30] <geser> should I prepare a debdiff ready for sponsoring?
=== cpg is now known as cpg|away
[12:47] <infinity> geser: Happy to sponsor if you toss it my way.
[12:57] <infinity> geser: Or, I'll just upload this in your name: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1548915/
[13:00] <infinity> geser: Err, I would if it didn't also FTBFS due to python multiarch. :P
[13:15] <cjwatson> infinity: geser's work was on top of my patch - http://paste.ubuntu.com/1548971/
[13:16] <infinity> cjwatson: Oh.  I just did that entirely differently (using python-config instead)
[13:19] <infinity> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1548982/
[13:19] <infinity> cjwatson: Is the plat_specific=True thing the more "correct" method?
[13:19] <cjwatson> *shrug*
[13:20] <cjwatson> I just thought it fit better in context
[13:20] <cjwatson> Yours is more compact, so whatever
[13:20] <infinity> I'm not picky at all.  Was just curious if there was an argument for one or the other.
[13:20] <cjwatson> I think on reflection I prefer yours
[13:20] <infinity> You know how much I don't love Python. :P
[13:22] <infinity> I'll just upload this, then.
[13:27] <infinity> dpkg-source-v3 + dh(1) + dh-autoreconf is love.  I might have kept maintaining PHP and Apache2 way back when if I'd had all this magic.
[13:36] <cjwatson> infinity: Yeah, after a decade of random-walking around the possible ways to do this we seem to have settled on something that's actually fun :)
[13:40] <infinity> I'd say something naively ambitious like "I should switch glibc to dh(1)", but I don't think I'm masochistic enough to even start figuring out how to do that.
[13:41] <infinity> Though, I won't deny that it would be nice if more than four people actually understood the glibc packaging.
[14:08] <geser> infinity: thanks for uploading it

[14:14] <cjwatson> infinity: I managed to switch grub2 a while back
[14:14] <cjwatson> infinity: Still working up the nerve to switch ubiquity ...
[14:15] <cjwatson> Actually, I suppose it wouldn't be too bad, but I kind of feel the need for debian/rules to be less awful in other ways at the same time.

[15:16] <infinity> hallyn: So, what do you plan to do about qemu and spice?  qemu-kvm-spice appears to be the only thing in qemu-linaro that isn't replaced by the new qemu.

[16:14] <Bluefoxicy> huh
[16:15] <Bluefoxicy> what if we did kernel updates by freezing everything, rebooting, then thawing everything?
[16:15] <Bluefoxicy> It works on Dragonfly

[21:48] <hallyn> infinity: well i want to take another look at spice, as someone claimed the dependencies may have changed so it may be easier to MIR now
[21:48] <lifeless> hallyn: oo I was going to ask you about spice
[21:48] <lifeless> hallyn: w/kvm specifically
[21:48] <hallyn> infinity: but more likely i'll have to continue having a separate source tree for qemu-kvm-spice.  Though I'll simply build it from the identical source as qemu, to help reliability/testing
[21:49] <hallyn> lifeless: and MIR ?
[21:49] <lifeless> hallyn: main doesn't stress me :)
[21:49] <lifeless> hallyn: I have universe on pretty much everywhere
[21:50] <hallyn> lifeless: ok - if yo'ure having issues, lets chat monday.  i've gotta run right now
[21:50] <hallyn> i'm open to changes, as things will have to change anyway - for now note we're ahead of debian with our spice version
[21:50] <lifeless> hallyn: ciao ;)
[21:50] <hallyn> (at least last i checked)
[21:50] <hallyn> ttyl :)
