[02:47] <BillyZane> i can chit-chat in here right?
[02:47] <TheLordOfTime> if its ubuntu related
[02:47] <BillyZane> rofl
[02:47] <TheLordOfTime> otherwise #ubuntu-offtopic may be better
[02:48] <BillyZane> i think ubuntu's partitioning systeming has spilt off on to iRC

[11:58] <apm1> will 12.04 get a kernel update ?
[11:58] <apm1> i mean will there be a newer kernel than the current 3.2 version in any future updates ?
[12:00] <SuperEngineer> apm1: enable "proposed" in sources - I got an update last week [I had forgotten proposed was enabled!]
[12:01] <apm1> SuperEngineer, thanks :)
[12:01] <SuperEngineer> ..so if proposed - then might be coming to normal release - but it was a "point" release
[12:02] <SuperEngineer> np
[12:06] <apm1> SuperEngineer, this isn't a major update this is  "3.2-36" while the normal repos have "3.2-35" hardly makes sense to change my repo list for a patch :p
[12:07] <SuperEngineer> apm1:  I let it in - no probs -but, yes, agreed
