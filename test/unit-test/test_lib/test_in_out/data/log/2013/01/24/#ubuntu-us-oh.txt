[00:01]  * skellat waits eagerly
[00:01] <Cheri703> Well, who all is here for the meeting?
[00:02]  * paultag can be here
[00:03] <Cheri703> Quite the turnout!
[00:03]  * drkokandy is here
[00:03] <Cheri703> ah, ok
[00:03] <skellat> And there was more than 48 hours notice this time!
[00:03] <Cheri703> Well, I'll start off with: we've recently been discussing trying to shift some focus from worrying about in-person events to having online events
[00:04] <Cheri703> Some discussion was had about video vs voice chat, and while I think mumble is a good idea, it *would* be hard to get photos of our "event" to send in
[00:04] <Cheri703> if it's a google hangout, we could at least do screenshots and such. With mumble, a screenshot of the signed in users isn't terribly impressive.
[00:05] <Cheri703> I think we'd still want to try to do ReLoCo stuff, but as far as trying to get people from larger geographical areas together, it's just not happening, so we'll go with online stuff.
[00:05] <Cheri703> Anyone have thoughts on that?
[00:06] <Cheri703> ...
[00:06] <Cheri703> aaaaanyone?
[00:06] <Cheri703> crickets
[00:06] <skellat> At this point I'm continuing to investigate video solutions and have not found anything satisfactory *yet*
[00:06] <drkokandy> I agree with trying to get ReLoCos together for some in-person events
[00:06] <Cheri703> if anyone wants to volunteer to develop an alternative to google hangouts, they're welcome to do that too ;)
[00:07] <drkokandy> Because without doing some things in person we're wasting the geographic foundation of the LoCo
[00:07] <Cheri703> drkokandy: we need to schedule one once the temperatures are consistently above 20 degrees again...it's too stinking cold to go anywhere right now
[00:07] <drkokandy> that is true
[00:07] <Cheri703> true drkokandy, but as spread out as we are, the geographic foundation is...tenuous
[00:08] <skellat> I've still got Lake Effect Snow Warning going until 10 AM tomorrow.  Wind chills have been hazardous to human flesh for anything but minimal time lengths of exposure.
[00:08]  * skellat had to go shovel out family cars before tonight's meeting
[00:09] <Cheri703> Oh, actually: I'll be in Cleveland the evening of 02/15 because I have to spend the night at the airport, if any ubuntu clevelanders wanted to hang out or grab dinner, I'd be game :)
[00:09] <Cheri703> I would like to do things in person, and had hopes of doing that at one time, but we seem to be getting sparser and sparser as far as people who actively participate.
[00:09] <Cheri703> I'd like to see some life in the mailing list/forums at some point.
[00:10] <skellat> We had fairly good IRC activity today
[00:10] <drkokandy> we've had a more active IRC than usual these past couple of weeks or so
[00:10] <Cheri703> yeah, but we have LOTS AND LOTS of people who are technically members of u-ohio and we have 21 signed in to chat right now
[00:11] <Cheri703> so...irc isn't exactly reaching the masses
[00:11] <skellat> No, it isn't
[00:12] <skellat> Then again, how many of the 400+ members actually have any connection or contact with the LoCo at large?
[00:12] <Cheri703> not many
[00:13] <Cheri703> Do we have a u-ohio g+ group? does anyone know?
[00:13] <drkokandy> not one that I'm a part of
[00:13] <skellat> I don't use G+
[00:13] <Cheri703> I think a lot of ubuntu folks are on g+, so probably could poke around there
[00:13] <skellat> We have an Identica group that paultag is the owner of
[00:13] <paultag> challah
[00:13] <paultag> Oh man
[00:13] <paultag> I can transfer
[00:13] <Cheri703> yeah...identica is....fairly dead afaik
[00:13] <Cheri703> ?
[00:13] <paultag> skellat: seeing as how you're an identica master, I'll chown to you
[00:14] <skellat> Identica is fairly alive Cheri703 and is still being developed
[00:14] <Cheri703> I've heard of a lot of people having issues with it
[00:14] <Cheri703> so I dunno
[00:14] <skellat> paultag: We'll talk about that separately as we may need Evan involved
[00:14] <paultag> ack
[00:14] <Cheri703> I think g+ is rapidly becoming a hub of ubuntu stuff
[00:15] <paultag> erm, hurm
[00:15] <paultag> skellat: http://identi.ca/group/ubuntuohio ‚Üê I'm not an admin D:
[00:15] <skellat> Identica is getting set to archive about 80% of the accounts as they're inactive and the data is going to go to Archive.org.  The active accounts remain active.
[00:15] <skellat> paultag: Crap!  I'll contact Evan separately so I can take control of that myself.
[00:16] <paultag> ack
[00:17] <skellat> Cheri703: I thought we had a Page on G+ back during one or the other of my abortive attempts to use the service.  I wonder if we still do.
[00:18] <Cheri703> looks like bioselement made a page
[00:18] <Cheri703> I'll reach out to him
[00:18] <drkokandy> Oh, found one: https://plus.google.com/116070181546687340819/posts
[00:19] <drkokandy> here's the community: https://plus.google.com/communities/113576253272216114772
[00:20] <Cheri703> sent a message
[00:20] <Cheri703> hopefully we can get that going a bit
[00:20] <skellat> I've pinged Evan via Identica to see if I can take control of the group there
[00:22] <Cheri703> So: Goals for this next month: Try to get some online presence going, whether g+, identica, mailing list, forum, also try to get some sort of local events moving in some capacity somewhere. Mansfield will have one this coming month, if any other areas can get SOMETHING to happen, that'd be great. Even if it's a "I will be at x location at y time with my computer and able to give demos" and have like a sign on your table or something. I dunno
[00:22] <Cheri703> . SOMETHING that is contact with the outside world. :)
[00:22] <Cheri703> I will probably post something to the mailing list tonight just to try to get some conversation going
[00:23] <Cheri703> well...will probably post within the next week or so. big work thing going on so my brain is a bit...wobbly
[00:23] <Cheri703> anyone have any other thoughts on that?
[00:23] <skellat> Nope.
[00:24] <skellat> I'll be running the educational session next Monday at 10 PM Eastern
[00:24] <Cheri703> Everyone can participate in getting things going on the mailing list btw ;)
[00:24] <Cheri703> awesome!
[00:24] <skellat> I'll be posting the slide deck to SlideShare
[00:26] <skellat> What metric do we want to use to measure the success of the event?
[00:26] <Cheri703> I think for the level of participation we usually get to events, HAVING the event is a success. :)
[00:26] <skellat> Okay
[00:27] <skellat> PING: Unit193 jrgifford canthus13 jacob
[00:27] <Cheri703> I'm serious! We haven't done something like that before, so I consider it a positive thing to be doing it at all :)
[00:27] <skellat> Alrighty
[00:28] <skellat> Is there anything paultag can share with us about the state of Debian efforts relative to Wheezy?
[00:29] <paultag> current RC bug squash rates place release at about 3 months out
[00:29] <paultag> if you'd like to see it sooner, fix bugs :)
[00:29] <paultag> BSP I'm helping run in Boston @ MIT this weekend
[00:29] <paultag> questions? :)
[00:29] <skellat> So we're looking at April instead of February then
[00:29] <paultag> yeah, sadly
[00:30] <paultag> there were some RC bugs found late in freeze
[00:30] <paultag> and it's set us back a bit, I think.
[00:30] <paultag> help is welcome, and as always I'd be glad to help anyone get involved
[00:30] <skellat> And for the record I'll remind folks across the LoCo that efforts to aid Debian in squashing bugs do trickle down to help Ubuntu
[00:31] <Cheri703> Alright, any other topics for tonight?
[00:32] <skellat> Any recent contacts with the LoCo Council?
[00:32] <Cheri703> talked with cz<tab> unofficially a few weeks ago
[00:33] <Cheri703> result of that convo was the push toward ANY activity, then working out in-person activity later
[00:34] <skellat> Laura Czajkowski, you mean?
[00:34]  * paultag chuckles
[00:34] <Cheri703> yeah
[00:34] <skellat> Alrighty
[00:35] <skellat> Cheri703: Could you ask Laura Czajkowski in her Launchpad-related capacity about whether or not it is possible to change the LoCo team's settings so that e-mail cannot be turned off?
[00:36] <Cheri703> I think that with spam and opt-in/out regulations we can't force email on anyone
[00:36] <skellat> Darn
[00:36] <skellat> Okay
[00:36] <skellat> I've got nothing else
[00:36] <Cheri703> I know that if I'd opted out of email and suddenly started getting it again, I'd be SUPER mad
[00:36] <Cheri703> so...yeah
[00:37] <Cheri703> ok. I guess that wraps things up for the meeting. I'll (as always) be idling in here, so if anyone has thoughts , feel free to toss them out!
[00:38] <skellat> Then we stand adjourned, I guess? Our next meeting is our educational session on Monday at 10 PM.
[00:38] <Cheri703> Yep. Have a good night folks!
[00:40] <drkokandy> sounds great! Good night all!
[01:33] <Unit193> skellat: Pong. :P
[01:45] <jrgifford> skellat: sorry!
[01:45] <jrgifford> Cheri703: so you'll be in cleveland-ish huh?
[01:46] <Cheri703> yeah, I'm flying out early saturday morning, and rather than deal with trying to get someone to drive me to cleveland at 5am, I'm going up friday night and I'll just find somewhere to sleep in the airport
[01:46] <jrgifford> hm. i think i'm busy, but i'll check
[01:46] <Cheri703> yeah, 02/15
[01:46] <Cheri703> if no one is around, no worries, just figured I'd mention it :)
[01:48] <jrgifford> ok
[10:37] <andygraybeal_> aye, morning
[14:58] <thafreak> Morning Ohio
[15:43] <yano> Hello Wisconsin^WOhio!
[15:44] <dzho> hi y'all
[15:56] <Cheri703> I think I decided on xubuntu for my long-term trial
[15:59] <paultag> ugh, goddamnit
[15:59] <paultag> I think someone took my Ubuntu mug from my Desk :(
[15:59] <paultag> I'm peeved, I liked that mug.
[17:25] <jrgifford> :\
[18:50] <paultag> it's the downside of working @ a loft
[18:50] <paultag> a lot of talks and stuff are held here and randors just walk through coworking
[18:50] <paultag> fucking annoying
[18:59] <canthus13> paultag: the upside being you can nail the asshat that keeps undoing your changes with a coffee cup from across the room. :)
[19:22] <paultag> :)
[19:25] <dzho> if you can *find* your coffee cup, that is
[19:26] <dzho> seek out one, you may find the other due to a pre-emptive move ;-)
[20:30] <thafreak> what the hell...i was trying to use virtualbox...
[20:30] <thafreak> and my computer went nuts
[20:30] <thafreak> swapping like no one's business
[20:30] <thafreak> I look, and I have like 2gb of free ram...but 2gb of swap being used!
[20:30] <thafreak> turned my swap off
[20:31] <Unit193> I'm trying out zswap, and I'll say it's pretty helpful when the computer starts swapping out.
[20:31] <thafreak> what does that do? just compress the swap?
[20:35] <Unit193> http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI1MDM or even better: https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/fe313521-2e95-46f2-817d-44a4f27eba32/entry/new_linux_zswap_compression_functionality7?lang=en
[21:25] <canthus13> 49.5MB for a 140 page manual? LG, you're really, really doing it wrong.
[21:26] <Unit193> But you need hi-res images!
[21:26] <canthus13> heh.  ALso, 140 freaking pages to use your TV? Seriously.
[22:30] <dzho> TV is probably more powerful than $REALLY_OLD_BUT_FAMOUS_COMPUTER
[23:09] <jrgifford> probably
[23:12] <dzho> I sort of want to try fuzzing our flatscreen TV or our digital video box thingie
