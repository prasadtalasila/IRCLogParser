[05:30] <twb> Where's the wiki article that describes malone's email command syntax?  I can never remember, and my search fu is weak
[05:30] <twb> Ah, it's on help.launchpad.net; my problem was searching with site:wiki.ubuntu.com
[05:30] <twb> https://help.launchpad.net/Bugs/EmailInterface
[05:31] <wgrant> Right, it's a Launchpad thing, not Ubuntu

[11:14] <teolemon> Hi
[11:14] <teolemon> I wondered whether there was anyone with the rights to increase the timeout limit for Search
[11:14] <czajkowski> hi
[11:15] <czajkowski> which search ?
[11:15] <teolemon> such as in this example
[11:15] <teolemon> https://translations.launchpad.net/ddtp-ubuntu/quantal/+pots/ddtp-ubuntu-universe/fr/+translate?batch=10&show=all&search=debugging+symbols+for
[11:15] <teolemon> give it a bit more room to complete the query
[11:16] <czajkowski> wgrant: ^^
[11:16] <wgrant> When that page is slow, it's *really* slow. We can't sensibly increase it enough to make it succeed frequently.
[11:16] <wgrant> The page needs to be fixed.
[11:17] <teolemon> ok :-/
[11:17] <teolemon> even one out of 10 would save the day
[11:17] <teolemon> to be honest
[11:17] <wgrant> Sure, but we'd have to at least double or possibly triple the timeout
[11:17] <wgrant> Which is not hugely sensible
[11:18] <teolemon> fair enough
[11:18] <teolemon> i reckon being more specific
[11:18] <teolemon> increases my chances of having the query complete
[11:18] <wgrant> Mmm, potentially a little.
[11:18] <teolemon> are there any factors, time of the day that may be useful
[11:18] <wgrant> No
[11:19] <wgrant> It's just that the translation system wasn't really designed for the sort of scale that that template requires.
[11:21] <teolemon> In how many parts would we need to split the template to solve the issue ?
[11:22] <teolemon> to make search somehow work again
[11:22] <wgrant> That's not really much of a solution.
[11:22] <wgrant> And I don't know a number.

[14:42] <TeemuO> hi, we have problems with branching
[14:42] <TeemuO> $ bzr branch -v lp:~codership/codership-mysql/5.5-23 5.5-23-1
[14:42] <TeemuO> Connection Timeout: disconnecting client after 300.0 secondsimate 685479/685804
[14:42] <TeemuO> bzr: ERROR: Connection closed: Unexpected end of message. Please check connectivity and permissions, and report a bug if problems persist.
[14:43] <TeemuO> branching freezes every time at about the same position and connection eventually times out
[14:44] <TeemuO> any ideas what could be the problem?
=== slank_away is now known as slank
[16:15] <idnar> so I have a project that I previously maintained in Launchpad, but I've now handed maintainership over to someone else who is continuing development in Github
[16:15] <idnar> what's the correct way to point people away from Launchpad for the functions that are no longer being handled in Launchpad?
[16:16] <idnar> (I assume just deleting the project completely is not the thing to do)
[16:18] <czajkowski> either delete it
[16:18] <czajkowski> or just add a note on the lp project page
[16:20] <dobey> idnar: pyflakes?
[16:20] <idnar> dobey: no, sorry, dosage
[16:21] <dobey> ah
