[17:54] <tgm4883> mhall119, do you have any links or info on packaging that as a library?
[17:54] <tgm4883> the mythtvservices lib
[19:42] <bobweaver> ping tgm4883
[19:52] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  my question for you or anyone http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FAYVJlUHU8
[19:58] <mhall119> tgm4883: usually as long as you have a good setup.py, the debhelper tools will do the right thing
[19:58] <mhall119> I'll give it a try later
[19:58] <mhall119> I'm in the middle of re-contructing my panty today
[20:12] <tgm4883> mhall119, yea, I don't think it's constructed right, and everything I've tried has failed on it
[20:13] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I don't like it
[20:13] <tgm4883> I vote go
[20:13] <bobweaver> mhall119,  what would you make different about it ?
[20:13] <bobweaver> sorry tgm4883  *
[20:14] <tgm4883> if I didn't know that it was from ubuntu phone, it would be absolutely meaningless. Seems to just be a blob in the background
[20:14] <bobweaver> Like at frist I thought of it like this.  Count how many times user is clicking on things and also searching things then use that data (LOCAL ONLY) to render the thing
[20:14] <tgm4883> While i'm fine with something being in the background (even moving in the background) I think it looks odd
[20:15] <bobweaver> whta if the center of it when hoving over it started playing movie ?
[20:15] <tgm4883> I think there are better things we could do with the background
[20:15] <bobweaver> thanks for your input tgm4883  I think it is great
[20:15] <bobweaver> like ...
[20:16] <tgm4883> for instance. If you play a song, what if we scrolled recent tweets about the artist?
[20:16] <tgm4883> (coming from the guy that doesn't use twitter)
[20:16] <bobweaver> But then a friend of mine was talking about music and was using itunes and said "I can never remember the name if that song" So I thought to myself if mouse over starts to play it then it would be easy to find.  as Long as you can remember the artist or some keyword.
[20:16] <tgm4883> tie in social
[20:16] <bobweaver> Like stuff from twitter ?
[20:16] <tgm4883> mouseover with a sample is a great idea
[20:16] <tgm4883> I like that
[20:17] <bobweaver> I could use lastfm and use that data to grab more from other places
[20:17] <tgm4883> yea, if you start playing a song, we should have the option to bring up info like that
[20:17] <tgm4883> so either in an optional side pane, or (better IMO) in the background
[20:17] <bobweaver> like previews ?
[20:18] <bobweaver> There is 2 things with that that I am at a cross roads with
[20:18] <bobweaver> Saviq,  and JAy player is not yet released and I want to use it for the center of the circle for movies and videos lens
[20:19] <bobweaver> jay's *
[20:19] <bobweaver> But I def need to figure out if I am going to use this thing
[20:20] <bobweaver> it is not the same as the phone. It is just what I thought that the code for the phone will be. It is going to be fun to compare  in the end:)
[20:20] <bobweaver> "welcome screen"
[20:21] <bobweaver> But before I make it have "fireworks" I figure that I would give 3 days of people saying yes or no and then run from that
[20:21] <bobweaver> Other thing is this
[20:21] <bobweaver> I am working on themeing
[20:21] <bobweaver> it is all done in photoshop or gimp
[20:22] <bobweaver> one just makes what they would want theme to look like in gimp and tool that I am making makes theme for Ubuntu TV ;_)
[20:23] <bobweaver> so there is no coding behind it at all. It is you make a picture and the tool that I am making (a modified  qml-exporter)
[20:23] <bobweaver> that makes the code
[20:24] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  what do you think about launcher in different places
[20:24] <bobweaver> ?
[20:24] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I suppose that would depend on how themable it is
[20:24] <bobweaver> I am re-writing the launcher also to be more like the Phone or do you think that I should wait on that ?  ]
[20:25] <tgm4883> I'd have to see what the phone is
[20:25] <tgm4883> I haven't looked much
[20:26] <bobweaver> well tgm4883  it comes with 5 or 6 different pictures that one needs to make    lensView (render type) , launcher, indicators , and misc like background and well that is all the tool does at this poiint
[20:26] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  we are blowing up on Google Plus today lol
[20:27] <bobweaver> I have been posting there a bunch
[20:27] <bobweaver> Hope it is ok
[20:27] <tgm4883> mhall119, can you put this on the facebook page  http://youtu.be/J4HGSJZhmXM
[20:27] <bobweaver> mhall119,  ^^
[20:27] <bobweaver> just let me know
[20:27] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I just posted there too
[20:28] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  did you put that on the google + page ?
[20:28] <tgm4883> yea
[20:28] <tgm4883> I've put it on the G+ page for UTV and mythbuntu
[20:28] <tgm4883> I'm putting it on the website soon, provided someone is around to approve that
[20:28] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  I have full thing ready for guide
[20:28] <tgm4883> sweet
[20:28] <bobweaver> it is qml of cource but it is ready
[20:29] <bobweaver> I kinda re-wrote what I think Saviq  wrote before
[20:29] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  what is the bug in libdee I am going to fix that shit
[20:30] <bobweaver> so I can use that
[20:30] <tgm4883> bobweaver, bug 1096708
[20:30] <tgm4883> it's fixed in 12.10, just needs a backport
[20:30] <tgm4883> or installing the newer packages
[20:30] <bobweaver> !bug 1096708
[20:30] <tgm4883> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dee/+bug/1096708
[20:32] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  you should target that for 12.04
[20:32] <bobweaver> j/s
[20:33] <tgm4883> bobweaver, it works in 12.04 as soon as the backport is available
[20:33] <bobweaver> like have 2 or is there something holding that back besides time ?
[20:33] <bobweaver> that is stupid
[20:33] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I know
[20:33] <bobweaver> I am done leting things like that hold me back
[20:33] <tgm4883> bobweaver, in order for me to fix it, I would have to report the entire thing back to python2
[20:33] <bobweaver> ahh
[20:34] <tgm4883> bobweaver, meh, I'll put it in a PPA with the updated packages, then it would work in 12.04 :)
[20:34] <bobweaver> right now as it is I am still using you scope from like a year ago
[20:34] <bobweaver> the one that is on the myth tv page
[20:35] <bobweaver> mythbuntu page/ blog *
[20:35] <tgm4883> yea, that will be getting updated at some point
[20:35] <tgm4883> need to sort the packaging though
[20:36] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  I think that we should start to get more feedback from the community
[20:36] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I agree
[20:36] <bobweaver> like posting alot simple questions on G+ and other things like that
[20:37] <bobweaver> I have been holding all that back for some stupid reason that I could not even justify in my head lol
[20:37] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  you should try ppa ;)
[20:37] <bobweaver> it is awesome I just killed like 8 bugs
[20:38] <bobweaver> bugs that where even in Unity 2d still in 12.04 I am going to have to figure out how to separate and make patches when I get the time
[20:38] <tgm4883> bobweaver, well i've got to fix the packaging issues first
[20:38] <tgm4883> because I split off the services library from the main package
[20:38] <bobweaver> what issue is that ?
[20:38] <tgm4883> installing the library isn't working right
[20:38] <bobweaver> ahh the ai
[20:38] <bobweaver> api *
[20:38] <tgm4883> so the scopes can't call it :(
[20:39] <bobweaver> boo
[20:39] <bobweaver> :)
[20:39] <bobweaver> what are http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtK0KMH-8xs
[20:39] <bobweaver> sorry
[20:39] <bobweaver> two things for 2 different placees
[20:40] <bobweaver> I have had to much coffee today
[20:41] <tgm4883> mhall119, if you have access to doadjustyourset, can you approve the post I just did there
[20:42] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  just a suggestion but I think that (again suggestion) you should use the Ubuntu TV account when you post to the google Plus page
[20:42] <tgm4883> didn't I?
[20:42] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  take that with grain of salt,
[20:43] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I reshared a post
[20:43] <tgm4883> so I shared it on my G+ page, then I signed into UTV account and reshared it
[20:43] <bobweaver> sweet yeah it was under your G+ page
[20:43] <bobweaver> sweet
[20:43] <tgm4883> which IMO is how it should be done?
[20:43] <tgm4883> I did the same thing under the mythbuntu page
[20:44] <bobweaver> wait till what you see what I am making woth g+ fbook and all that jazz
[20:44] <tgm4883> so it branches off the source
[20:44] <bobweaver> sould be done in a month I thin k
[20:44] <bobweaver> ahh I see v.cool @
[20:45] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  should I take and make a thing in the dash that does everything that gnome-control-center does ?
[20:46] <tgm4883> well it seems that gnome-control-center is plugin driven
[20:46] <bobweaver> about to make video about themes brb
[20:46] <bobweaver> it is all glib
[20:48] <tgm4883> also, when sharing like that, it makes it a bit easier for me to see the ripples
[20:48] <tgm4883> because I can just look at my post
[20:48] <tgm4883> and makes a more logically source I think
[20:57] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  I am now learning python for this tool that you are about to see. But I sure do wish that there where {in py}
[20:58] <tgm4883> heh
[20:58] <tgm4883> yea, no brackets means you have to be good with whitespace
[21:01] <bobweaver> eff that I am dyslisic
[21:02] <bobweaver> woops I uploaded to the wrong accound :/
[21:02] <bobweaver> accont *
[21:02] <bobweaver> er
[21:02] <bobweaver> re-uploading
[21:04] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  the main reason that I have been all pissie is because one I am quiting ciggs and 2 I am poor and am having issues on that end but things are starting to look up and sorry about my outbursts sometimes I am just driven because of my past
[21:04] <tgm4883> no worries, sometimes other stuff gets in the way
[21:05] <tgm4883> me4oslav was looking for you yesterday I think
[21:05] <bobweaver> yeah it has gotten bad for me but I am a hard worker and I am not going to break the law so I have to deal with it
[21:05] <bobweaver> on u2t ?
[21:05] <tgm4883> yea
[21:11] <bobweaver> tgm4883, if you like I posted video on the G+ page about theming I dont know if it is easy to follow but I figure what the hey
[23:11] <bobweaver> I need to get wayland to work on QtCreator but I can not afford all the licensing fees to have the workspace :/
[23:11] <mhall119> tgm4883: I don't think I was ever given admin access to doadjustyourset
[23:12] <bobweaver> There has to be a way ....land way around this
[23:12] <bobweaver> ahh cool
[23:12] <bobweaver> do you all need hosting space ?
[23:12] <bobweaver> to move blogs
[23:12] <bobweaver> that is all that I can offer
[23:14] <bobweaver> but that is weaksause on the i = i&i = locked
[23:15] <mhall119> tgm4883: posting your video on Facebook
[23:15] <tgm4883> thanks
[23:17] <bobweaver> mhall119, I want more public inter action I have learned A lot of things that the People think just on G+ would be cool to have days like this more often. I mean I would Have never even thought about having html themes with out comment on G+
[23:18] <bobweaver> at str = "audience participation "
[23:18] <bobweaver> var *
[23:19] <bobweaver> I want to make it so the "audience makes Ubuntu TV
[23:19] <bobweaver> Not 4 people behind canonical
[23:19] <bobweaver> that is  NOT what I am saying that it is ATM
[23:19] <bobweaver> ATM = at the moment
[23:21] <bobweaver> have a strong urge against things that lock a users reality into a diametictal er shart dislykia
[23:21] <bobweaver> die-a-met-tra-cal
[23:21] <bobweaver> objects
[23:21] <mhall119> html themes on what? Unity?
[23:22] <tgm4883> bobweaver, I don't think 4 people at canonical are making Ubuntu TV
[23:22] <bobweaver> mhall119,  so I took qmlexporter and re-wrote it to make thems for skin of 2d
[23:22] <tgm4883> I think the community is making Ubuntu TV
[23:22] <bobweaver> but I kept in mind qt 5
[23:23] <mhall119> yeah, I wish we still had 4 people at canonical working on it
[23:23] <bobweaver> the whole time
[23:23] <bobweaver> lol
[23:23] <bobweaver> I misunderstand things to often
[23:23] <mhall119> actually I think our max Canonical staff was 3
[23:25] <bobweaver> it is hard to convey things to a massive scale on such a platform that we are possessed
[23:27] <bobweaver> If we are going to take this over I want to make the next year a testing platform esp because of the things that I read ever morning  ESP with X
[23:27] <bobweaver> ESP with X
[23:27] <bobweaver> a true plateform inmho can not conatain a X
[23:28] <bobweaver> er
[23:28] <bobweaver> ....
[23:28] <mhall119> are you talking about X11 server?
[23:32] <bobweaver> sorry about that power went out
[23:32] <mhall119> np
[23:32] <mhall119> you getting a bunch of snow up there?
[23:33] <bobweaver> not that much it is cold not much snow in the rust belt
[23:34] <bobweaver> But it would be cool to see what the community could make "could thought (out of air)")
[23:35] <mhall119> indeed, lots of ideas in the community just waiting for somebody who can implement them
[23:35] <bobweaver> I can drop bombs
[23:36] <bobweaver> sometimes not that good
[23:36] <bobweaver> I am working on that
[23:36] <mhall119> better than I can
[23:36]  * mhall119 assumes bombs == code
[23:38] <bobweaver> its hard when life is  ..AE2
[23:41] <bobweaver> but I have a buieutiful life around me sometimes it is v.easy to forget these things, But I also think  that this is a perfect example of how somethin lie this can apply to the youth around us
[23:43] <bobweaver> tbh with all of you
[23:44] <bobweaver> They say that we are in the stage of the "bonic" part of tech , tehn why not think about the heart of it all like the spores of tech
[23:44] <bobweaver> seems silly to stick to anything but that
[23:46] <bobweaver> everything is moving out word or so they say ....IDK I do know that spores are smaller then bonic matter though
[23:48] <bobweaver> I guess I will make option for 3d cube in tv tonight
[23:50] <bobweaver> have  a good one ^cube I mean^   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhWS_bN-T3k
[23:51] <bobweaver> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FjuPn7MXMs
[23:52] <bobweaver> mario also works on wayland with Box2d so could desktop
