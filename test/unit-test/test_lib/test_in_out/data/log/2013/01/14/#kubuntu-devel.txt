[14:32] <Riddell> so uec also does alpha releases I guess
[14:32] <ScottK> Interesting.
[14:32] <ScottK> That was sort of not mentioned.

[14:54] <yofel> shadeslayer: re tomahawk, you should be able to just copy the PPA stuff with a clean changelog and maybe a fix here and there
[14:55] <shadeslayer> and copyright stuff
[14:55] <shadeslayer> your packaging has no proper copyright iirc
[14:55] <yofel> oh yeah, was too lazy for that

[15:39] <afiestas> are virtuoso pacakges build/link with -g ?
[15:39] <afiestas> shadeslayer:  ? :p
[15:39] <shadeslayer> you mean with debug symbols?
[15:40] <afiestas> shadeslayer: yes
[15:41] <shadeslayer> iirc no, but you could enable dbgsym to get some dbg packages I guess
[15:41] <shadeslayer> I see libvirtodbc0-dbgsym
[15:42] <shadeslayer> but that's only for ODBC libs I'm afraid
[15:43] <shadeslayer> I also remember being poked about this earlier, and asked around why we didn't build with dbg symbols, but I can't recall the reason behind it
[15:43] <shadeslayer> oh
[15:44] <shadeslayer> afiestas: we do we do!
[15:44] <shadeslayer> "cd . &&   CFLAGS="-g -O2 -fstack-protector ...."
[15:45] <Riddell> shadeslayer: doesn't do much good if the symbols aren't extracted but
[15:45] <shadeslayer> Riddell: yeah
[15:45] <shadeslayer> I'm not completely sure how the dbgsym stuff works
[15:46] <afiestas> shadeslayer: from where do I get the symbols?
[15:46] <afiestas> or Riddell :p
[15:46] <shadeslayer> afiestas: There's no separate -dbg package I'm afraid
[15:47] <afiestas> okz
[15:47] <shadeslayer> huh
[15:47] <shadeslayer> afiestas: there should be a -dbgsym package though
[15:47] <shadeslayer> Riddell: http://paste.kde.org/646616/
[15:47] <afiestas> shadeslayer: where?
[15:47] <shadeslayer> !dbgsym
[15:47] <ubottu> dbgsym is https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash
[15:48] <afiestas> I hate when you send me to a wiki page
[15:48] <shadeslayer> afiestas: follow " If there is no -dbg package:"
[15:48] <afiestas> with bazilion lines of text
[15:49] <shadeslayer> I'm still trying to figure out where the -dbgsym package is
[15:49] <afiestas> shadeslayer: should I go ahead with the instructions?

[15:50] <apachelogger> mhhh
[15:50] <apachelogger> http://wiki.debian.org/AutomaticDebugPackages
[15:50] <shadeslayer> afiestas: won't do you any good .... I can't see a -dbgsym package for it
[15:50] <Riddell> there's no -dbgsym
[15:50] <afiestas> oks
[15:50] <afiestas> next time then
[15:50] <shadeslayer> k
[15:51] <shadeslayer> though that's the one package I'm aware of that intentionally has no -dbg package
[15:52] <shadeslayer> build id's looks really cool
[15:52] <apachelogger> I think I have seen ddebs somewhere on launchpad, so there is support for it I suppose 
[15:53] <apachelogger> not sure if that has been widely discussed in ubuntu though
[15:53] <shadeslayer> yes, you have to enable them manually
[15:53] <apachelogger> why don't we do that? :P
[15:53] <shadeslayer> dunno
[15:57] <yofel> Space I guess
[15:58] <yofel> and it would mostly duplicate our debug symbols
[15:58] <shadeslayer> wtff
[15:58] <shadeslayer> http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/pool/main/v/virtuoso-opensource/
[15:58] <shadeslayer> that has the packages
[15:58] <shadeslayer> but apt says it knows nothing about them
[15:58] <yofel> shadeslayer: yeah, for libvirtodbc0
[15:58] <yofel> that's all
[15:59] <shadeslayer> hmm
[15:59] <shadeslayer> apparently they got lost after 6.1.0 ?
[16:00] <yofel> shadeslayer: not really, that package is transitional
[16:01] <shadeslayer> Oh .. ok
[16:03] <shadeslayer> yofel: have a look at the build log though, seems to me a dbgsym packages should have been created

[16:14] <Riddell> apachelogger: tomahawk getting packages at last?
[16:15] <Riddell> meh, I can't get the symbols file in libqaccessibilityclient to work on all arches, I'll just make it arch specific unless anyone wants to see what I'm missing
[16:20]  * yofel gives it a try
[16:21] <Riddell> yofel: I've got ec2s set up if it's useful
[16:21] <Riddell> I added --with kde which I'd forgot
[16:22] <Riddell> but it's still different on i386vs amd64
[16:23] <yofel> my server should be fast enough, doesn't look like it'll be a long build
[16:23] <Riddell> no it's not
[16:26] <yofel> looks to me like it's missing a few {size_t} substs
[16:26]  * yofel retries
=== Tonio_ is now known as Tonio_aw
=== Tonio_aw is now known as Tonio_
[16:34] <yofel> Riddell: uploaded again, was missing a symbols file that was confirmed on both archs + --with pkgkde_symbolshelper it seems
[16:34] <yofel> hm, forgot to add --with kde. Does it need it?
[16:43] <Riddell> hmm I thought --with kde included pkgkde_symbolshelper
[16:44] <Riddell> I guess not, neurons still reconnecting
[16:44] <Riddell> thanks yofel!
[16:44] <yofel> yep, built now
[16:45] <yofel> shadeslayer: adding --with-debug to virtuoso results in:

[17:00] <Riddell> ScottK: do I want to use libboost1.49-dev or libboost1.50-dev?
[17:00] <ScottK> Riddell: 49
[17:00]  * ScottK double checks
[17:01] <Riddell> but but it's 0.01 old!
[17:01] <mikhas> Riddell, that release took much longer than expected â€¦ the road to Maliit 1.0 remains difficult.
[17:02] <Riddell> Quintasan_: are you able to package that or will you need someone else to do it?
[17:11] <yofel> Riddell: libboost-dev poins to 1.49. Unless that changes you'll get conflicts with 1.50 *somewhere*
[17:11]  * yofel adds a missing t
[17:12] <shadeslayer> yofel: sure, but why isn't it there to begin with?
[17:12] <xnox> default is 1.49, you can use 1.50 if you need to. but we decided not to do boost1.50 transition ahead/without debian in raring.
[17:12] <yofel> dunno, whoever packaged it didn't think he would have to manually enable debugging symbols?
[17:13] <yofel> and since there's no -dbg package it probably wasn't checked either
[17:15] <shadeslayer> mmm
[17:15] <shadeslayer> yofel: let's enable it then
[17:15] <shadeslayer> I don't see anything in debian that says they had it and removed it on purpose
[17:17] <ScottK> Yeah.  1.49.
[17:17] <yofel> me neither, changelog doesn't mention debuggin symbols at all
[17:18] <yofel> shadeslayer: I'll upload with symbols then, easy to revert if it does something weird
[17:18] <shadeslayer> righto
[17:18] <shadeslayer> yofel: and symbols?
[17:18] <yofel> er
[17:18] <yofel> debug
[17:18] <shadeslayer> :P
[17:18] <shadeslayer> and do you plan on doing a separate -dbg package
[17:18] <shadeslayer> or just let dbgsym do the job

[22:42] <yofel> Your build takes 4hrs or less to build - I think kdelibs already violates that

[22:42] <yofel> *meet
[22:42] <shadeslayer> well ... I was thinking more along the lines of Plasma Active
[22:43] <shadeslayer> because we can get PA builds up quickly
