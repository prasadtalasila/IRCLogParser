[22:20] <knome> pleia2, another thing we might want to touch: http://identi.ca/group/xubuntu
[22:20] <pleia2> identi.ca kind of makes my head explode
[22:21] <pleia2> there are one or two trolls there
[22:21] <pleia2> (million!)
[22:21] <pleia2> :)
[22:21] <knome> yeah, but since the group is administered by somebody whose nick (no pun intended) sounds familiar, i think we should get at least the logo updated
[22:22] <pleia2> ah yes, I'll give him a nudge
[22:22] <pleia2> haven't heard from him lately though
[22:22] <knome> just tell him to email me if he needs help with (exporting) artwork
[22:25] <knome> the url on his blog articles image discloses that he has blogged on august. so not years of silence. yet.
[22:25] <pleia2> he's kind of been in and out
[22:27] <knome> just as a final note, however much you hate identi.ca, would you be willing to join as an additional admin (if you have an account)
[22:27] <knome> hah, we're only 37 followers away from identica's numbers on twitter.
[22:28] <pleia2> I suppose, if only for nuclear option recovery
[22:28] <pleia2> am pleia2 there too, but don't use it
[22:28] <knome> just to have somebody from the team that's active (on the team) on the admins.
[22:28] <pleia2> I don't really understand how groups work though
[22:28] <pleia2> yeah
[22:29] <knome> me neither
[22:29] <knome> i don't think it's like an account
[22:29] <knome> i suppose it's more like a group for a hash(exclamation)tag or something
[22:29] <pleia2> yeah
[22:29] <pleia2> why that needs an admin... who knows :)
[22:29] <knome> btw, can others see https://twitter.com/i/connect ?
[22:30] <knome> if not, that's a bit shame
[22:30] <pleia2> no
[22:30] <pleia2> but they can search for @Xubuntu
[22:30] <knome> yup.
[22:31] <pleia2> actually that doesn't do what I wanted
[22:31] <pleia2> bah twitter
[22:31] <knome> lol
[22:31] <knome> my phone asked "should we update the date and time?"
[22:31] <knome> i was like "err"
[22:31] <knome> then "ok"
[22:31] <knome> and it advanced the clock 1 minute.
[22:31] <knome> "ok"
[22:46] <drc> ah...you have the slackware phone...no auto-nothing :)
[22:47] <SkippersBoss> ev; twitter has got its uses
[22:48] <SkippersBoss> evening all
[22:50] <SkippersBoss> on a totally different note. Is there anything doc wise that's going to happen in Ringtail ?
[22:50] <pleia2> we're planning on appointing SkippersBoss the docs lead to figure that out
[22:50] <pleia2> seriously though, let me look at blueprints
[22:50] <SkippersBoss> pleia2, euh you want thing done
[22:50] <SkippersBoss> :_0
[22:51] <pleia2> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/other-r-xubuntu-docs
[22:51] <pleia2> not a whole lot, looks like
[22:52] <SkippersBoss> Can understand though when you are delegating
[22:53] <pleia2> it's a difficult cycle for me, new job + wedding planning, I'm pretty overwhelmed with Life life :)
[22:54] <SkippersBoss> I thought you two were trying out wedding planners LOL
[22:54] <pleia2> we didn't, that was a mistake :)
[22:54] <pleia2> too late now
[22:55] <knome> pleia2, i can design your invitations, but only if you give me free hands
[22:55] <knome> ;)
[22:59] <SkippersBoss> define free hands
[23:00] <knome> nah
