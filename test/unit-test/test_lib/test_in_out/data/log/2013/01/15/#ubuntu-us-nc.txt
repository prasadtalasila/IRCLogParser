[18:12] <Nivex> a suggestion: Ubuntu have these available for their releases: http://www.ryanlerch.org/blog/fedora-18-released-print-your-sleeve/
[19:37] <MarkB1> is anyone running an Android env + apps, on Ubuntu -- some web-hits about that....
[19:38] <MarkB1> (not speaking of the Ubuntu stuff on Android, or Ubuntu phones....)
[19:51] <holstein> MarkB1: i havent tried yet
[19:51] <holstein> so far, im generally wishing i had a desktop machine when im on my phone
[19:51] <holstein> i dont really want to port the apps i consider to be compromises over to my desktop
[19:52] <holstein> i think that is the trend though
[19:52] <MarkB1> holstein: that's why folks buy those monster Droids or Samsung phones, I guess.... ugh, rather have a chromebook or maybe a tablet
[19:52] <holstein> the screen size is the least of it
[19:53] <holstein> for me, anyways
