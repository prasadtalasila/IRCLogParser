[18:22] <nantou> an employer cannot access the documents I have uploaded to ubuntuone, am I doing something wrong?
[18:22] <nantou> do I have to grant access privileges to the employer or the directory that contains said files?
[19:28] <nantou> for shared files with thunderbird, do I have to grant access privileges on a case to case basis?
[19:29] <nantou> and what happens then? does the added email address receive a notification to access the files and then I get a confirmation that said recipient has effectively accessed the files?
