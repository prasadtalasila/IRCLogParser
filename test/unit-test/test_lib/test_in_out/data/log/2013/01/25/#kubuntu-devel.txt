[00:53] <phoenix_firebrd> good morning everyone
[00:59] <BarkingFish> good morning :)
[01:00] <BarkingFish> Well, it almost is.  Sometime ago, I had a bug with ndiswrapper not building on dkms - Bug #1023645 - it was fixed in quantal, and it's back in raring :(
[01:00] <ubottu> bug 1023645 in ndiswrapper (Ubuntu Quantal) "ndiswrapper-dkms 1.57-1ubuntu1: ndiswrapper kernel module failed to build [error: ‘struct kernel_stat’ has no member named ‘cpustat’]" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1023645
[01:00] <BarkingFish> according to the record there, apparently a fix has been released for raring - and it's not worked.  I've had to boot into raring on an old kernel, 3.5.0.22 in order to get ndiswrapper up.
[01:09] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: did you update the bug report?
[01:09] <BarkingFish> yeah, just left a note on there for Julian, the one who set Fix released
[01:10] <BarkingFish> also mistakenly called him Julius :P
[01:10] <BarkingFish> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/1023645/comments/31

[01:10] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: whats the kernel version in which bug is present
[01:10] <BarkingFish> i wish ubottu wouldn't keep doing that :)
[01:11] <BarkingFish> 3.8.0.1
[01:11] <BarkingFish> *3.8.0-1
[01:11] <BarkingFish> brb
[01:11] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: it seems someoneelse has posted a commont the same sort
[01:11] <phoenix_firebrd> later
[01:14] <BarkingFish> ok phoenix_firebrd, cheers.  
[01:15] <BarkingFish> It might be good if I post some logs of what i'm getting told when I try to build it manually or with dkms.  It got fixed in quantal, i don't understand what could have gone wrong in the space of 6 months and no upgrades :/
[01:19] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: past the log 
[01:19] <phoenix_firebrd> *paste
[01:19] <BarkingFish> ok, one moment
[01:25] <phoenix_firebrd> back in 5 mins
[01:27] <BarkingFish> ok
[01:27] <BarkingFish> i need to reboot too.  I think i may be doing something wrong :)
[01:41] <shadeslayer> Riddell: O_O
[01:43] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: morning
[01:43] <shadeslayer> hi phoenix_firebrd
[01:43] <shadeslayer> morning to you too
[01:43] <shadeslayer> and finally someone I can say morning to at a sane time
[01:43] <phoenix_firebrd> did you succeed with the libkolab tests?
[01:43] <phoenix_firebrd> :)
[01:44] <shadeslayer> somewhat
[01:44] <shadeslayer> as yofel mentioned, the tests open kompare
[01:44] <shadeslayer> and tried to make kompare quit using a couple of methods
[01:45] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so the developers thought we should be building the source without the pbuilder?
[01:45] <shadeslayer> dbus, kquitapp ( which is basically just another wrapper over dbus for KDE apps ), using kill `pidof kompare` .... nothing worked
[01:46] <shadeslayer> I even tried extracting the dbus address from /proc/pid_of_komare/environ
[01:46] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: usually tests don't wait for an app to be closed
[01:47] <shadeslayer> it's not unusal to have tests that require X running
[01:47] <shadeslayer> but it's unusual to open an app and keep waiting for it to be closed
[01:47] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: why is this written pbuilder unfriendly 
[01:48] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: because pbuilder is just a packaging tool used by packagers
[01:48] <shadeslayer> it holds no significance when writing code :)
[01:48] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i know but the devs know that we will be testing with pbuilder right?
[01:49] <shadeslayer> nope
[01:49] <BarkingFish> hi again.
[01:49] <shadeslayer> pbuilder is just a packaging tool
[01:49] <shadeslayer> hey BarkingFish
[01:49] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so this is why Riddell is not using pbuilder
[01:49] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: to each his own :)
[01:49] <BarkingFish> hi shadeslayer :)
[01:49] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: got the log?
[01:49] <shadeslayer> you can use sbuild or whatever
[01:50] <shadeslayer> pbuilder is just the de facto standard in Ubuntu land for build packages
[01:50] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: the testing would be easy if i use a vm with a full install right?
[01:50] <shadeslayer> not really
[01:50] <BarkingFish> the error, phoenix_firebrd  - i forgot and did it in a tty, so couldn't copy / paste
[01:51] <phoenix_firebrd> BarkingFish: ok
[01:51] <shadeslayer> you could just add your ppa, install the kolab stuff, try it out and remove the PPA
[01:51] <shadeslayer> that's what I usually do
[01:51] <BarkingFish> the upshot is, i can't install manually, because apparently it can't find KBUILD - it needs me to supply the path to KBUILD when i try to manually make ndiswrapper.
[01:51] <BarkingFish> and i forgot entirely how the hell to get dkms to do anything :)
[01:51] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: but the package is only done for raring and i have 12.10
[01:52] <shadeslayer> ah
[01:52] <shadeslayer> then setup a VM
[01:52] <shadeslayer> though you could just use a pbuilder for that too
[01:52] <shadeslayer> unless it's a graphical app, in which case it's better to do it in a VM
[01:54] <shadeslayer> see pbuilders --login option
[01:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: is there a way to take a snapshot of the base image of pbuilder?
[01:54] <shadeslayer> huh?
[01:54] <shadeslayer> snapshot?
[01:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i saw that already
[01:55] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya if i use save after login, it will update the base image , but if i want to have the dfault base, i have to create it again right?
[01:56] <shadeslayer> then don't use --save-after-login?
[01:56] <shadeslayer> just do a --login
[01:56] <shadeslayer> and the changes won't be saved
[01:56] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: if i want some packages to be installed before the pbuilder starts building
[01:57] <phoenix_firebrd> ?
[01:57] <shadeslayer> can you give me a usecase?
[01:57] <shadeslayer> as to why you would want to do that? I can advise better that way
[01:57] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: example i want dbus and dbus-x11 to be installed
[01:58] <shadeslayer> why?
[01:58] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer:  in case an app needs as a requirement 
[01:58] <shadeslayer> then you add it to Build-Depends
[01:59] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: no not as a dep , but for some other purpose
[01:59] <shadeslayer> define 'other purpose'
[01:59] <shadeslayer> for eg. I added xvfb and other stuff to Build-Depends for libkolab tests
[02:00] <shadeslayer> even though it's not required to compile libkolab, it's required to run the tests
[02:00] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: tell me how can i install something before pbuilder starts 
[02:00] <shadeslayer> I still don't see why you'd want to do that :P
[02:01] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: tell me
[02:01] <shadeslayer> because let's say you do it, that change will be local, and when you upload it to Launchpad, the build will fail
[02:01] <shadeslayer> because it doesn't have that dep installed
[02:01] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: well .. you could write a hook, or install it by hand and use --save-after-login
[02:02] <phoenix_firebrd> i min
[02:08] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: sorry i was on the phone
[02:08] <shadeslayer> np
[02:08] <shadeslayer> I'm about to leave though, in another 10 minutes or so
[02:09] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: what you say is right and i know that too, but i want to know how to do that
[02:09] <shadeslayer> ok, like I said, 2 ways
[02:09] <shadeslayer> one way keeps the chroot clean
[02:09] <shadeslayer> the other is quicker
[02:09] <BarkingFish> i'm going to be going soon, but if anyone can help me with the dkms thing, your assistance would be appreciated. 
[02:10] <shadeslayer> BarkingFish: tried #ubuntu-x ?
[02:10] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: we can't login to the env when pbuilder running?
[02:10] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: sure you can
[02:10] <BarkingFish> I want to run raring with what it came with - not pollute it by having to use an old kernel, so i need to either get dkms to build ndiswrapper, or be able to build it manually.
[02:10] <BarkingFish> shadeslayer, no, i didn't even know it existed
[02:10] <BarkingFish> :)
[02:11] <shadeslayer> heh
[02:11] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: sec
[02:11] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: https://wiki.kubuntu.org/Kubuntu/Ninjas/BuildEnvironment
[02:11] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so there is not way of running or installing an app expect to add to deps
[02:11] <BarkingFish> that's for xorg apparently
[02:11] <shadeslayer> read the section on Pbuilder Hooks
[02:11] <BarkingFish> this isn't anything to do with xorg from what I can see :)
[02:11] <shadeslayer> BarkingFish: but isn't DKMS related to X ?
[02:11] <shadeslayer> oh
[02:12] <shadeslayer> dunno then, sorry
[02:12] <shadeslayer> there's also #ubuntu-kernel
[02:12] <shadeslayer> so *maybe* that helps?
[02:12] <BarkingFish> aha
[02:12] <BarkingFish> you bet it does
[02:12] <shadeslayer> awesome
[02:13] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: I don't follow your question
[02:13] <shadeslayer> when you install an app, it should pull in everything it requires
[02:13] <shadeslayer> there's a Depends field explicitly for that
[02:14] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: tell me how can i install dbus and dbus-x11 before pbuilder starts testing apart from adding it to deps and and with out using the save after login option
[02:15] <shadeslayer> write a hook
[02:15] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats nice
[02:15] <shadeslayer> see the wiki page I just sent you a couple of lines back
[02:15] <shadeslayer> and note the hook names
[02:16] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: i am reading that
[02:16] <shadeslayer> the hook names signify at what point in the build they're run
[02:17] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: so you wrote a hook to kill kompare?
[02:17] <shadeslayer> no
[02:17] <shadeslayer> writing a hook is not feasible for that because that hook is not there in the build
[02:17] <shadeslayer> so I tried killing it via debian/rules
[02:17] <shadeslayer> note that hooks are only local
[02:18] <shadeslayer> the buildd has no hooks / extra packages installed
[02:18] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: ya, i am asking it purely for local purposes only 
[02:18] <shadeslayer> it will only read debian/control and install the packages it reads from the Build-Dep line
[02:18] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: for testing my things 
[02:18] <shadeslayer> okay
[02:18] <shadeslayer> anyway, gtg
[02:18] <shadeslayer> cya
[02:19] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: bye
[07:25] <jussi> Morning ladies and gents
[07:56] <highvoltage> hello jussi
[07:57] <jussi> gday highvoltage!
[07:59] <jussi> highvoltage: hows things? been a while since we talked...
[08:00] <highvoltage> jussi: oh well
[08:01] <highvoltage> jussi: been tough but I have a feeling everything is going to be ok
[08:01] <highvoltage> jussi: and you?
[08:01] <jussi> highvoltage: yeah, doing ok, kid growing, work going ok.
[08:41] <yofel_> phoenix_firebrd: hi, as shadeslayer said, installing packages by hooks is usually not recommended as it's purely local, but look at the B20icecc hook as an example
[08:41] <yofel_> as those packages only make sense locally they're installed by hook
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[08:41] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel_: ya i know, but its like the "goto"
[08:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: for local personal testing purposes
[08:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have some doubts on using amazon ec2
[08:42] <yofel> sure, it's just that you should usually keep your setup as clean as possible to use different pbuilder images
[08:42] <yofel> I have a couple of quantal images with different setup for example
[08:43] <yofel> (different sets of PPA's added etc.)
[08:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[08:43] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: how much does it cost the community if i use the cloud for an hour?
[08:44] <yofel> you'll have to ask Riddell what kind of ec2 instance he's using and then look up the prices
[08:44] <yofel> it's usually not that much though, and a higher productivity is usually woth it
[08:45] <yofel> *worth
[08:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel:  i am using it past 3 hrs and i am worried about the cost
[08:45] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: building fast-md5 now
[08:46] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: working with the ec2 is bliss except the char echo speed is slow because of my show internet  connection
[08:47] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: probably with a 400 ms delay
[08:50] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: well, the pricing is here: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/ but I don't know where the instance is nor what kind
[08:51] <yofel> meh, they still only accept credit cards :(
[08:55] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: this one is a partial log http://paste.kde.org/656090/
[08:55] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: fast-md5 build fails
[08:56] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: from the log the resulting output is a jar
[09:00] <yofel> the new build.xml has no jar target, so the error is right
[09:00] <yofel> I know 0 about ant so can't really help here
[09:01] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok i will drop this build process and exit the ec2 session
[09:02] <yofel> make sure to power it down if you know that you don't need it anymore
[09:02] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: dont it affect someone else?
[09:02] <yofel> I don't think those sessions are shared, you'll have to ask Riddell though
[09:03] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: yesterday he asked me if he can shutdown , i am confused
[09:04] <yofel> uhm, they charge by runtime, so he was wondering whether you were still using it before he shuts it down
[09:04] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so can i shutdown  now?
[09:04] <yofel> let's wait for him if you're not sure
[09:05] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: in that case i will just exit the session
[09:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: did you review the packages in my ppa?
[09:06] <yofel> I did for kolab
[09:06] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: I am planning to remove the ssh and gpg keys, will that affect the packages in the ppa?
[09:07] <yofel> I'm not familiar with the others so it'll have to wait till the evening if you want *me* to review them
[09:07] <yofel> I can't upload them anyway
[09:07] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: nope, only new uploads/commits
[09:08] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so removing the present ssh and gpg keys from launchapd and from my local doesnot affect the packages in the ppa  correct?
[09:11] <yofel> whatever is already on launchpad isn't affected. The keys are only used to identify you to launchpad from outside of the WebUI
[09:12] <yofel> the ppa has it's own signature key for the binary packages
[09:12] <yofel> *its
[09:12] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[09:13] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: can you recommend some packages that needs priority from here http://qa.ubuntuwire.com/uehs/no_updated.html
[09:18] <yofel> hm, I don't recognise pretty much all packages on that list, so there isn't really anything from us left
[09:18] <yofel> at least nothing with a working watch file
[09:18] <yofel> (someone remind me to fix the one in kile)
[09:19] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will remind you.
[09:20] <yofel> let's see if mom has something
[09:20] <yofel> https://merges.ubuntu.com/
[09:20] <yofel> (universe.html)
[09:21] <yofel> Riddell: is koffice-l10n still used by something?
[09:22] <yofel> shadeslayer: go merge quassel ;)
[09:23] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: is that the merge request dashboard ?
[09:23] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: it's the auto-generated list of packages that could be merged with newer versions from debian
[09:24] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: so i should pick from here
[09:24] <yofel> well, I'm not a merge expert, or at least not an expert at teaching it, and quassel seems to be the only thing from our packageset in there
[09:24] <yofel> let's see if it's worth i
[09:24] <yofel> *it
[09:25] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok , shall i try?
[09:30] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: doesn't look like it's really worth it on first glance, but feel free to
[09:30] <yofel> I couldn't find the classic merge guide, the udd one is here and usually works too: http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/udd-merging.html
[09:31] <yofel> just use debianlp:sid/quassel as debian branch
[09:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok
[09:32] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i can do this later?
[09:32] <yofel> there's not a lot to merge here, so it should be not too hard
[09:32] <yofel> sure
[09:33] <yofel> if you won't do it it'll probably be forgotten for a while
[09:33] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: why?
[09:33] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: one thing though. If you do start on it, mention that in the (invisible) comment field on https://merges.ubuntu.com/universe.html
[09:34] <yofel> phoenix_firebrd: the debian package doesn't really add anything except some maintenance changes compared to our package
[09:34] <yofel> so usually nothing I would spend my time on. But good as an example
[09:34] <yofel> (good as an example that actually yields something useful)
[09:35] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i will try this with the help of you or someelse
[09:35] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i am new to this
[09:37] <yofel> sure. Once you did the merge you've seen most of our packaging activities I think. Except for packaging something from scratch
[09:37] <yofel> not sure if we have something in the queue for that
[09:38] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: i have done packaging from scratch , like the the nepomuk metadata extractor
[09:38] <yofel> ah good
[09:40] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: which reminds me about the python optimization, did you do it? 
[09:40] <yofel> no, better look for someone else as that looks time consuming from what I've seen and I don't have that much spare time currently
[09:41] <yofel> (or at least am not motivated enough to spend a few days on that)
[09:42] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: ok, the python thing takes 1h 10 min for compiling the ontologies , thats not good right?
[09:43] <yofel> I tried it, I know, took half an hour even on my i7
[09:44] <phoenix_firebrd> brb
[09:51] <phoenix_firebrd> going to building simple-http
[09:51] <phoenix_firebrd> yofel: what happended to libkolabxml?
[09:58] <phoenix_firebrd> ah its merged
[10:00] <allee> afiestas: debian pkgers asked: what's the mininal version of  kdelibs, kdeworkspace that required for (lib)kscreen?  
[10:01] <yofel> allee: CMakeLists.txt should tell you that
[10:02] <yofel> but doesn't yay
[10:02] <yofel> allee: I don't think we've tried to build it with anything older than 4.9
[10:03] <yofel> allee: kdeworkspace doesn't seem to be needed though
[10:19] <yofel> afiestas: about kscreen: <pinotree> why does it require qjson 0.8?
[10:29] <afiestas> allee: no idea tbh
[10:29] <afiestas> but anything 4.9 and greater works
[10:30] <afiestas> should work in 4.8 as well I guess
[10:30] <afiestas> but only 49 and above is supported
[10:30] <afiestas> yofel: because it does? :33
[10:30] <afiestas> qjson 0.7.1 is not able to properly serialize floats
[10:30] <yofel> ah ok
[10:30] <afiestas> tbh, getting tired of having to asnwer these questions :s
[10:31] <afiestas> I mean, it is like the 5th time I do, maybe I should document it somewhere
[10:31] <yofel> heh
[10:31] <allee> afiestas: can't be wrong :-)
[10:39] <vassie> Riddell: Hello, new package uploaded ;)
[10:44] <vassie> Riddell: In the build queue, will keep an eye on it
[11:22] <Riddell> good stuff vassie 
[11:23] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: a basic ec2 machine costs 8.5UScents an hour
[11:26] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: is that hi or low?
[11:27] <Riddell> it's cheap for an hour, it's expensive to leave it on for a year
[11:28] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: should i shutdown after finishing my work or just exit the session?
[11:28] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: yes you should terminate it with "poweroff"
[11:29] <Riddell> or by telling me
[11:29] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: will it affect anyone else
[11:36] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: shutting down a machine?  depends if anyone else is using the machine
[11:36] <Riddell> they're not usuall shared, the whole point is it's a quick way to get an isolated environment
[11:37] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: ok
[11:38] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: in that case whenever i need, i will ask and after finishing my work i will leave a message for you or if no one else is using i will shutdown
[11:38] <Riddell> yep
[11:39] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: the user ubuntu is public?
[11:39] <Riddell> no, when I start a machine it has an ssh key only I have for access and I can add other people's ssh keys
[11:40] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: so you added mine from launchpad?
[11:41] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: I think i am asking the wrong question
[11:42] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: yes I did
[11:42] <Riddell> vassie: best to bump the ppa version no, 0.9.2-0ubuntu2~ppa1  -> 0.9.2-0ubuntu2~ppa2
[11:42] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: I need my ssh key files in there, what should i do
[11:43] <Riddell> phoenix_firebrd: I'll add it when starting up a machine for you
[11:43] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: thank you
[11:50] <vassie> Riddell: ah, thought i had to bump the ubuntu number
[11:50] <Riddell> vassie: either works but best to bump the ~ppa one in a ppa
[11:50] <vassie> Riddell: shall i cancel the current build and resubmit?
[11:50] <Riddell> vassie: no no leave it
[11:51] <vassie> Riddell: k
[11:52] <vassie> Riddell: hope this one works, what comes after? runtime deps and backports?
[11:55] <phoenix_firebrd> Riddell: I am not using the ec2 now
[12:03] <phoenix_firebrd> bbl
[12:18] <Riddell> anyone have a UEFI secure boot computer thing?
[12:18] <Riddell> or know what to buy for one?
[12:21] <yofel> Riddell: I think anything that's certified for Window 8 should work for that
[12:49] <Riddell> hmm this says not easy to identify http://superuser.com/questions/396905/how-to-identify-uefi-capable-laptops
[13:07] <xnox> Riddell: you can download OVMF and set it up in KVM
[13:08] <xnox> Riddell: these instructions are the best https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SecurityTeam/SecureBoot
[13:08] <xnox> note that it doesn't save state, so one can provision SB keys and "reboot" with SB mode, but not shutdown kvm & start again.
[13:21] <Riddell> hmm, lots to read
[13:24] <Riddell> basse?  basse who made konqi?
[13:24] <basse> hi. just wanted so say congratulations for kubuntu developers. just finished upgrading from natty to oneiric to precice to quantal
[13:25] <Riddell> that's quite an upgrade!
[13:25] <basse> and it all just worked :)  ok. well, lost wireless for a bit, but that was just wrong drivers and easy fix.  and on the process, got 40gigs more space on my harddrive, which is kind of strange. but i like it :)
[13:25] <basse> Riddell: yes, thats the same basse
[13:26] <Riddell> welcome back :)
[13:26] <basse> heh thanks. i've been here all the time tho..  :)  maybe a bit more on the blender side of things.
[13:28] <Riddell> you can blend us a kubuntu raring ringtail to say thanks :)
[13:30] <basse> what is that?
[13:31] <Riddell> the codename for 13.04, a ringtail lemur
[13:31] <Riddell> which is raring to go
[13:32] <basse> cute
[13:33] <BluesKaj> Hey all
[13:34] <basse> Riddell: so it's like the kde logo and something around that.. looking at the previous logos
[13:35] <basse> well.. not kde.. but the gear thing 
[13:36] <Riddell> basse: what is?
[13:36] <basse> logo..
[13:37] <Riddell> basse: the kubuntu logo not "gear thing" :)
[13:37] <basse> :)
[13:37] <Riddell> anyone fancy testing usb-creator-kde for python 3?
[13:38] <Riddell> yofel: I thought I deleted koffice-l10n
[13:38] <Riddell> hmm apparently not
[13:40] <basse> you wouldn't know anything about the grahic tablet settings in new kubuntu?
[13:41] <Riddell> yofel: package removed
[13:41] <Riddell> basse: only that we added the wacom system settings module
[13:41] <Riddell> but it hasn't got much testing
[13:41] <basse> i'm running my carefully crafted dual-monitor-swapping script .. and i a bit afraid of trying this nice new tool that basicly looks like that would do the same thing..
[13:41] <basse> except hotkey..
[13:42] <basse> wondering if it saves over some settings..  or uses xinput.. 
[15:44] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: poke
[15:45] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: looks like I'll be officially postponing working on VPN plugin install automatisation
[15:45] <cyphermox> (which means unofficially I'll get to it eventually, just not in paid work)
[15:45] <cyphermox> feel free to hack at it and ask questions though, if you want to patch that early

[16:01] <yofel> JontheEchidna: is there some way to run an a command after an apt-get dist-upgrade (or any apt command) finishes? Or are there only dpkg triggers?
[16:01] <yofel> I was wondering if we could have some popup after a kde upgrade that people should please restart their session.
[16:01] <yofel> Not sure if the current notification helper behaviour is best for that
=== fenris is now known as Guest10857
[18:05] <JontheEchidna> yofel: it's pretty much limited to dpkg triggers
[18:05] <JontheEchidna> as far as I know
[18:12] <yofel> hm, ok, thanks :/
[18:23] <yofel> killing ksmserver is a bad idea
