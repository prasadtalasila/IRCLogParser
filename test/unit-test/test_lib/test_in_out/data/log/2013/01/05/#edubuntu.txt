[16:37] <clem> Hi guys I would like to add a software to edubuntu that lets kids learn concepts of progamming
[16:38] <alkisg> Which software?
[16:38] <clem> well it is one we are working on
[16:38] <clem> it is not finished just jet
[16:38] <clem> in the form I want
[16:39] <clem> alkisg
[16:39] <alkisg> OK, so...?
[16:39] <clem> are you asking me what the approach will be ?
[16:39] <alkisg> No I'm asking you which software it is, what do you mean "add it to edubuntu" etc...
[16:39] <clem> ok it is a visual progamming language
[16:40] <clem> here is a link
[16:40] <alkisg> It's not me that will add it to edubuntu, I'm just asking the basic staff for the others to see when they're available
[16:40] <clem> http://www.ixp.com/is-uml-a-programming-language.jsp#isumlaprogramminglanguage
[16:40] <clem> under the banner
[16:41] <clem> there is the step overview
[16:41] <clem> those steps the students will connect to diagrams
[16:42] <clem> learning data flow logic flow algorithms and things like transactions
[16:42] <clem> etc.
[16:42] <clem> by add to eduubuntu
[16:42] <clem> I would like to make the composer part of the edubuntu distribution
[16:43] <alkisg> Do you mean preinstalled, or available at the repositories?
[16:43] <alkisg> Is it open source software? Is it online or can it be run locally?
[16:43] <clem> once it has been finished in respect to the learning experience
[16:44] <clem> well the composer is a stand alone software
[16:44] <clem> the runtime environment on the server
[16:44] <clem> would be a free service from us
[16:45] <clem> and part of it I can make open source
[16:46] <clem> I want to keep the server as a service to make the user experience as smooth as possible
[16:46] <clem> not to have to set up the server
[16:46] <clem> too
[16:46] <clem> I see that programming is introduces in my country
[16:46] <clem> Austria
[16:46] <clem> in India
[16:46] <clem> and the States
[16:47] <clem> those are the countries I have experience with
[16:47] <clem> the concepts that I want to address are fundamental
[16:47] <alkisg> The best way to include an open source program (even if it's the client part only) to edubuntu is to make it available in debian
[16:47] <clem> and fuether the understanding at early age
[16:48] <alkisg> There's some packaging involved there, i.e. to make your software in a .deb form
[16:48] <clem> debian
[16:48] <clem> ah
[16:48] <clem> ok
[16:48] <clem> and then
[16:48] <alkisg> (ed)ubuntu most of their software from debian
[16:48] <clem> sorry for this simple question
[16:48] <alkisg> *get
[16:48] <clem> and then what is next ?
[16:49] <alkisg> Then it'll be available in all *buntu flavors with a simple apt-get install program
[16:49] <clem> and how do I get it on the disk
[16:49] <clem> apt-get is remote install
[16:50] <clem> can I get it in  the distribution ?
[16:50] <alkisg> Once it's available in the ubuntu repositories, you can ask the edubuntu team to see if they want to consider having it preinstalled on the disk
[16:50] <clem> ah
[16:50] <clem> ok and
[16:50] <alkisg> But I'm not sure they'll like the part that it needs a proprietary server...
[16:50] <clem> could I ask the team to give us feed back even befor we make this request
[16:50] <clem> to improve the software for that purpuse
[16:51] <clem> well
[16:51] <clem> hm
[16:51] <alkisg> Sure... you can either ask here in weekdays, or in edubuntu-users ML
[16:51] <alkisg> Or even with the contact form in edubuntu.org
[16:51] <clem> the server is not so easy to get going
[16:51] <clem> Ah ok
[16:52] <clem> so I will be back and edubuntu-users ML
[16:52] <clem> thanks
[16:52] <clem> well I understand that the server might not be liked
[16:52] <alkisg> https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/edubuntu-users
[16:52] <alkisg> https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/edubuntu-devel
[16:53] <clem> but I try to make the user experience as easy as using a web page
[16:53] <alkisg> Usually the programs that _most_ people will use, get preinstalled in the DVDs
[16:53] <clem> and that needs a high level of automating things
[16:53] <alkisg> And usually they need to be open source, e.g. the nvidia proprietary drivers are not preinstalled...
[16:54] <clem> from diagram to code in java with all the features is not just as easy as using a web page
[16:54] <clem> that is
[16:54] <clem> ah I see
[16:54] <alkisg> I don't think that anyone will object, if you keep the server side code open as well, and just offer it as a free service too
[16:54] <clem> open source
[16:54] <clem> ok
[16:54] <clem> hm
[16:55] <clem> the server side code has to be open too ?
[16:55] <alkisg> Nothing "has" to be done... it's all up to you
[16:55] <clem> ah ok
[16:55] <clem> well I will try
[16:55] <alkisg> But usually people support more truly FLOSS approaches
[16:56] <clem> I am honestly interested in supporting the edu effort
[16:57] <clem> I understand
[16:57] <clem> Thanks I ll be back
[16:57] <clem> greatings from Austria
[16:57] <alkisg> You're welcome
[16:57] <alkisg> Greetings from Greece :)
[16:58] <clem> or is that too personal
[16:58] <clem> where are you ?
[16:58] <alkisg> Where in Greece? Ioannina... why?
[16:58] <clem> I know where greece is :)
[16:59] <clem> Ah
[16:59] <clem> I like the to imagine where the other person is that I am talking to
[16:59] <clem> I am about 20 km south of Vienna
[16:59] <clem> have a nice evening
[17:00] <alkisg> I've been in wiener neustadt a few years ago
[17:00] <alkisg> Nice places you have there
[17:00] <alkisg> Good evening to you too
[17:01] <clem> that is not too far away
[17:01] <clem> I am in Maria Enzersdorf
[17:01] <clem> so I will come back and make the client available for tests
[17:01] <clem> I am looking forward to the feedback
[17:02] <clem> ah
[17:02] <clem> dam
[17:02] <clem> the client is in java
[17:02] <clem> hm
[17:02] <clem> does that matter
[17:02] <clem> for the process
[17:02] <clem> it is the same right
[17:02] <alkisg> Not really
[17:02] <alkisg> Yeah it's about the same
[17:02] <clem> k
[17:03] <clem> technically it is there might be a rile or so
[17:03] <clem> rule or so
[17:03] <clem> but there is not
[17:03] <clem> very well
