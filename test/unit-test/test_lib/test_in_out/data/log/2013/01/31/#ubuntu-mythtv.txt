[16:24] <yceps> Hello all, I'm on mythbuntu 12.04 and trying to find where mythexport puts its logs
[16:25] <tgm4883> yceps, /var/log/mythexport.log ?
[16:25] <yceps> im trying to launch the mythexport daemon using 'sudo service mythexport start'. but it isn't started when i check its status.
[16:25] <yceps> tgm4883: nah, doesn't exist
[16:25] <yceps> should i touch it?
[16:25] <tgm4883> nah
[16:26] <tgm4883> how about /var/lib/mythtv/mythexport.log?
[16:26] <yceps> tgm4883: nah :*(
[16:26] <tgm4883> yceps, anything in syslog?
[16:28] <yceps> 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' , then try start the service. nothing gets written to thel og
[16:33] <tgm4883> rhpot1991, ^
[16:45] <yceps> I've just looked through the mythexport-daemon script and looks like it should be spitting logs out at /var/log/mythtv/mythexport.log
[17:03] <yceps> I can use mythtranscode instead of mythexport right?
[17:44] <rhpot1991> grrr, looks like he is gone
