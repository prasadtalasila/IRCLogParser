[05:29] <greg-g> rick_h_: snap-l http://blog.grossmeier.net/2013/01/20/grandpas-tool-chest/
[11:39] <rick_h_> greg-g: awesome
[11:40] <rick_h_> greg-g: that looks so cool
[11:41] <rick_h_> greg-g: http://blog.lostartpress.com/category/books-in-print/the-anarchists-tool-chest/ yea, definitely a toolbox. Some tool chest designs
[11:43] <rick_h_> http://blog.lostartpress.com/2012/08/13/refurbishing-a-tool-chest/
[11:43] <rick_h_> http://blog.lostartpress.com/2012/08/24/the-traveling-anarchists-tool-chest/
[11:45] <rick_h_> I'm debating on trying to build either http://blog.lostartpress.com/2013/01/11/a-quick-tour-of-the-dutch-tool-chest/ or http://blog.lostartpress.com/2012/02/18/anarchists-tool-chest-on-the-woodwrights-shop/
[12:39] <snap-l> Well, it was too good to be true:
[12:39] <rick_h_> ruh roh

[12:42] <snap-l> Also, keyboard is scheduled for Friday
[12:42] <snap-l> Not sure JoDee can last that long. ;)

[12:59] <snap-l> Lemons -> Lemonade
[14:41] <snap-l> Looks like the UPS on this computer at work is having issues
[14:41] <snap-l> came in to find it "overloaded"
[14:41] <snap-l> even though there wasn't much plugged in or even operational
[14:42] <snap-l> apparently it is something to do with the fans connected to it.
[14:43] <brousch> We had 3 UPSes wigging out today too
[14:43] <brousch> Must have been a very brief power outage here
[14:43] <rick_h_> ugh
[15:25] <jrwren> snap-l: so did you snag all the material from bandcamp while it was marked CC ?
[15:25] <jrwren> their mistake is your added freedom!
[15:31] <snap-l> jrwren: No, I didn't.
[15:31] <snap-l> And frankly I'd rather save my resources for folks who "get it".
[15:32] <snap-l> Would have been awesome though if they had, but there is still time. The project isn't signed to a label.
[15:32] <snap-l> I doubt they'll reconsider, but you never know.
[15:35] <snap-l> You get nothing if you don't ask.
[17:42] <jcastro> hey snap-l
[17:42] <jcastro> do you own drums at this point in time?
[17:43] <jcastro> n0p: are you off today?
[17:43] <n0p> nope, working
[17:46] <jcastro> n0p: we need to find time to jam bro
[17:50] <snap-l> I have a drum set that needs reskilling
[17:50] <snap-l> reskinning, too. ;)
[17:50] <snap-l> The heads are over 10 years old.
[17:51] <snap-l> Just give me a few days notice, I'll get some new heads.
[18:05] <jcastro> well, that's 2 people
[18:05] <jcastro> n0p: *cough*
[18:06] <n0p> eh, i have so much to do on my house, and so out of practice.. :-/ soonest i see myself having fun is summer time
[18:07] <jcastro> man have you ever heard me play?
[18:07] <jcastro> I am the worst one
[18:07] <jcastro> it could be like stress relief
[18:08] <jcastro> plus "crappy" for flav is like awesome for the rest of us
[18:42] <rick_h_> http://r.bmark.us/u/bd898d5cbe1711 is interesting in the Ubuntu/Obama combination of things.
[18:42] <rick_h_> "When I was at Threadless, it was all physical boxes and it was RHEL, I wanted to kill myself!" :P
[18:57] <jcastro> Request Time: 0.374
[18:57] <jcastro> nice metric!
[19:05] <snap-l> TIL: There was a //e Platinum: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_Platinum_IIe.jpg
[19:05] <rick_h_> hah, well that's just how long it took my app to d/l the original article
[19:05] <snap-l> Man, Apple made some sexy hardware.
[19:27] <brousch> snap-l: They still do
[19:40] <rick_h_> *sigh* 2minutes on the bootstrap mailing list and I'm already afraid. Damn people that don't know how things work :/
[19:50] <snap-l> rick_h_: Twitter makes it, so it must be automatic.
[19:50] <brousch> I didn't like bootstrap. It requires grbage in your HTML
[20:44] <Wolfger> call me way behind the times, but Precise Pangolin isn't the latest release, is it?
[20:46] <snap-l> It's the latest LTS release
[20:46] <snap-l> 12.04
[20:46] <snap-l> Work is starting on Raring Ringtail
[20:46] <snap-l> 13.04
[20:46] <snap-l> Quantal Quetzal was 12.10
[20:47]  * snap-l really hopes he can win $$ for knowing these things someday.
[20:48] <Wolfger> Just wondering why I only upgraded to Precise today, and didn't upgrade a second time. It's because Kubuntu is dead, isn't it? :-p
[20:49] <brousch> No. LTS does not automatically upgrade
[20:49] <Wolfger> oh
[20:49] <brousch> You need to explicitly tell it to upgrade to non-LTS
[20:49] <brousch> Kubuntu is the best Ubuntu
[20:49] <Wolfger> always was
[20:49] <brousch> Well, server might be better
[21:20] <Wolfger> I'm annoyed with package management and/or k3b. Every time I run k3b it tells me packages can be installed for additional functionality. It's always the same package (mp3) and I always say yes and it always says it successfully installed. :-/
[21:22] <brousch> Wolfger++
[21:28] <Wolfger> installed lame manually, now can rip to mp3, but still getting same freaking message
[21:29] <brousch> Yes. Evr time
[21:29] <snap-l> Anyone else having problems with Dropbox saying it Can't find Dropbox folder?
[21:29] <snap-l> s/find/access/
[21:30] <snap-l> I managed to clear that message out yesterday with a reboot, and now it's back
[21:30] <brousch> Mine seems OK
[21:30] <snap-l> I'd rather not have to reboot
[21:30] <snap-l> and the only info I found made mention of redoing grub
[21:31] <snap-l> Which makes me wonder what the hell grub would have to do with Dropbox.
[21:31] <brousch> geez
[21:31] <brousch> yeah
[21:31] <brousch> At worst I would think uninstall/reinstall dropbox
[21:31] <snap-l> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2078554
[21:31] <snap-l> Good ol' ubuntuforums
[21:32] <snap-l> I swear I'd block 'em forever if they didn't turn up the occasional nugget.
[21:32] <snap-l> I tried reinstall
[21:42] <jcastro> snap-l: try blowing away .dropbox
[21:42] <jcastro> (not .dropbox-dist)
[21:42] <jcastro> and then restarting it
[21:42] <snap-l> won't that cause problems?
[21:42] <jcastro> actually, close it, remove the directory, and then restart it
[21:42] <jcastro> it'll need to reindex and so on
[21:42] <jcastro> but it's like, an equivalent of a clean install for db
[21:43] <snap-l> I moved it to .dropbox.old
[21:58] <snap-l> ARGH!
[21:58] <snap-l> Still says it can't access dropbox folder.
[21:58] <snap-l> What the hell
[21:59] <jcastro> huh
[21:59] <jcastro> what's the permissions on it?
[22:00] <snap-l> 700 with me as the owner
[22:01] <snap-l> 770 = same result
[22:02] <snap-l> The infuriating part is it was working just fine until it wasn't
[23:07] <jrwren> jcastro: fun with fanzoo on wednesday?
