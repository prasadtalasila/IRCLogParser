[02:01] <mhall119> jcastro: does Rackspace have something like S3?
[02:11] <mhall119> nvm, found Cloud Files
[07:23] <dholbach> good morning
[08:19] <JoseeAntonioR> hey dholbach! will you be having your devel hangout today?
[08:34] <JoseeAntonioR> oops, just noticed the away msg, no worries then
[10:51] <dholbach> dpm, do you have time for a call?
[10:56] <dpm> dholbach, sure
[10:56] <dholbach> cool
[11:43] <AlanBell> aquarius: can you fix it so that smartscopes returns valid json please?
[11:44] <AlanBell> it returns several lines, each of which is valid json, but the page as a whole isn't parseable
[11:47] <AlanBell> oh, then again this would appear to be intentional chunking
[12:09] <aquarius> AlanBell, oi, stop poking the unfinished API ;)
[12:09] <aquarius> it's not done yet :)
[12:10] <aquarius> AlanBell, well, you are welcome to poke it, but it's not done yet, and it might go away, etc, etc
[12:11] <aquarius> AlanBell, also, as you have correctly divined, each line is valid json. Bear in mind that the response may arrive in parts with delays: we'll return stuff as soon as we get it, so the dash can display it as soon as it gets it. If the whole response was valid JSON, then you could not do that, because you have to wait until the whole response is in to parse it. Hence, the response is a sequence of valid-JSON
[12:11] <aquarius>  chunks,.
=== amithkk_ is now known as amithkk
[12:11] <aquarius> JSON is not amenable to being streamingly parsed.
=== amithkk is now known as Guest8601
[12:11] <aquarius> u1db uses the same approach: JSON chunks.
[12:14] <AlanBell> thanks aquarius
[12:15] <dholbach> aquarius, ready for later on? :)
[12:15] <aquarius> dholbach, yep :)
[12:15] <dholbach> awesome
=== smartboyhw_ is now known as smartboyhw
[14:41] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: hey, if you want more audience you can post it to the fridge, or give me a link and I'll work on it
[14:42] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, ah, that'd be cool - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/AutomatedTesting/Hackfest is the page with all the details
[14:44] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: is it fine if I get https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2013-January/036401.html ?
[14:44] <JoseeAntonioR> or that's intended for another type of audience?
[14:45] <dholbach> sure, or http://daniel.holba.ch/blog/2013/01/automated-testing-hackfest-2/
[14:45] <dholbach> any of the  two
[14:45]  * dholbach rounds up UDW audience
[14:49] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, mind MCing again? ;-)
[14:49] <JoseeAntonioR> nope, no worries
[14:50]  * JoseeAntonioR goes to the paste
[14:50] <dholbach> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589774/
[14:50] <dholbach> it's "day 3" today, but that should be it :)
[14:50]  * dholbach rushes out and takes the dog for a walk - brb
[14:50] <JoseeAntonioR> thanks!
[14:50]  * dholbach hugs JoseeAntonioR
[14:50] <dholbach> thank YOU
[14:50]  * JoseeAntonioR hugs dholbach back :)
[14:50] <dholbach> you're doing a fantastic job
[14:51] <JoseeAntonioR> you owe me a hug in May!
[14:53] <dholbach> :-)
[15:41] <jcastro> popey: hey
[15:42] <jcastro> popey: tldr; I'm asking the forums moderators if they also want to moderate G+
[15:51] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: ping
[15:53] <JoseeAntonioR> aquarius: are you the same as sil on IRC?
[15:53] <aquarius> yep
[15:53] <JoseeAntonioR> aquarius: and are you giving a session in UDW in a while?
[15:53] <aquarius> I'm up in 7 minutes, right?
[15:53] <JoseeAntonioR> yep
[15:55] <JoseeAntonioR> cjohnston: if you're around, can we get a !c in classbot, please?
[15:56] <cjohnston> done
[15:56] <cjohnston> JoseeAntonioR: did that fix it?
[15:56] <JoseeAntonioR> I hope so
[15:57] <JoseeAntonioR> thanks
[15:57] <cjohnston> you hope so? there wasn't a problem?
[15:57] <cjohnston> or did something in the calendar change
[15:58] <JoseeAntonioR> yes, we had sil instead of aquarius, I changed it and you fetched it
[15:58] <JoseeAntonioR> we can't see the result until the actual time
[15:58] <aquarius> yeah, soz :)
[15:59] <cjohnston> gotcha
[16:00] <cjohnston> just lookin for context
[16:01] <JoseeAntonioR> and worked! :)
[16:02] <cjohnston> cool
[16:10] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, thanks!
[16:10] <JoseeAntonioR> np :)
[16:18] <dholbach> jcastro, did we pick a UGJ date?
[16:18] <jcastro> I am not sure
[16:18] <dholbach> I thought we said something about "around beta"
[16:18] <dholbach> but it wasn't on our calendar
[16:18] <dholbach> and I couldn't find it elsewhere
[16:20] <dholbach> does anyone else know?
[16:22] <jcastro> it's usually right around beta
[16:22] <jcastro> the weekend after isn't it?
[16:26] <dholbach> I don't know
[16:29] <dholbach> balloons, when do you want a world of testers to be available in the beta timeframe? after beta freeze? after beta release?
[16:29] <dholbach> beta 1? 2?
[16:29] <dholbach> which weekend would be the best?
[16:29] <balloons> hmm
[16:29]  * balloons goes to look at schedule
[16:31] <pleia2> balloons: when we discussed this earlier in the cycle, I proposed feb 22-24 based on testing things, but I changed my mind since that's the same weekend as SCaLE11x so I'll be out of town ;)
[16:31] <balloons> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RaringRingtail/ReleaseSchedule
[16:32] <jcastro> pleia2: agreed
[16:32] <pleia2> jcastro: will you be there?
[16:32] <jcastro> and I have a full plate at scale so I wouldn't be able to like run an event on top of the other stuff
[16:32] <jcastro> yeah
[16:32] <balloons> what about right before feature freeze?
[16:32] <pleia2> jcastro: doing a talk at ubucon?
[16:32] <jcastro> at pgday on the friday
[16:32] <pleia2> ah
[16:32] <jcastro> but I can stop by ubucon
[16:33] <pleia2> I'm doing a "cloud stuff on ubuntu" talk
[16:33] <jcastro> I am doing some server UI testing too for the juju gui
[16:33] <balloons> say the week of the 25th feb, or following week in march
[16:33] <pleia2> will have to pick your brain closer to the day ;)
[16:33] <balloons> 1 month from now essentially
[16:33] <jcastro> oh cool, mine is only a lightning talk at pgday, maybe I can switch back and forth
[16:33] <pleia2> cool
[16:33] <pleia2> balloons: it tends to be friday-sunday
[16:34] <balloons> yes, lol.. so mar 1-3
[16:34] <pleia2> sounds good to me
[16:34] <balloons> it's just before feature freeze.. things should hopefully be ok.. there's always rushing
[16:35] <dholbach> or pretty broken :)
[16:36] <pleia2> last ugj was the day after beta1, so everyone saved up breaking things until that friday ;) I showed up at the jam with a pile of isos whose installer crashed on launch (it went into livecd though)
[16:36] <pleia2> gave me a nice example of "this is a bug!"
[16:37] <jcastro> yeah that was always a problem for me
[16:37] <balloons> lol -- indeed
[16:37] <jcastro> "I hope no one brought the ISO from 2 days ago, here's one from 1 hour ago."
[16:37] <balloons> but after featurefreeze will be worse, trust me
[16:37] <balloons> so it's first march weekend or the third march weekend immho
[16:38] <jcastro> also
[16:38] <jcastro> come to think about it
[16:38] <jcastro> a modern "bug day" would be more about writing tests than manually sorting bugs, right?
[16:39] <dholbach> we have an automated testing hackfest tomorrow
[16:39] <dholbach> and will have another one this cycle
[16:39] <dholbach> the earlier we get more test cases the better
[16:39] <dholbach> but of course we wouldn't say no to new tests if they come around UGJ time :)
[16:39] <jcastro> yeah I am just thinking outloud, why have manual bug days when you can have more testing hackfests?
[16:40] <jcastro> but whatever, I am ok with any day, I'll either be SCaLEing or not, either way, I'll be working on ubuntu. :)
[16:40] <dholbach> it depends on your skillset - not everybody can do stuff like http://developer.ubuntu.com/packaging/html/auto-pkg-test.html#the-actual-tests
[16:40] <jcastro> pleia2: I am going to be doing usertesting of the juju gui if you have any sysadmin friends that want to check it out and go through the tests.
[16:40] <balloons> indeed.. and manual tests do need to be run also :-)
[16:41] <jcastro> it'll be like "deploy samba" and then you try to do that and then you tell me what you hate, and so on
[16:41] <pleia2> jcastro: tomorrow?
[16:41] <pleia2> or scale?
[16:41] <jcastro> scale
[16:42] <pleia2> cool
[16:42] <jcastro> they're going to provide me with like working wireframes or something like that
[16:42] <jcastro> with ideas on how to do foo, bar, baz
[16:42] <jcastro> and I just need to get feedback from real people on what they like/hate/meh.
[16:44] <snap-l> Quick q: who would I contact about some thoughts on deprecating the team reports?
[16:44] <snap-l> at least the wiki team reports?
[16:44] <snap-l> I've found our team reports are essentially copies of what we put into the loco directory
[16:45] <snap-l> with a few added links for pictures and other text
[16:45] <snap-l> (blog posts, mostly)
[16:45] <jcastro> did someone say removing junk from the wiki?
[16:45] <snap-l> I believe I did
[16:46] <jcastro> jet me a mail and I'll bring it up with jono, he's on holiday for the rest of the week, so I can bring it up tuesdayish?
[16:46] <snap-l> OK, I'll "jet" that. ;)
[16:47] <jcastro> also, the new stereo is awesome
[16:47] <jcastro> the extra 25 watts really makes a difference
[16:47] <snap-l> jcastro: Very cool. I'll have to come over for an audition. ;)
[16:47] <jcastro> per channel I mean
[16:47] <snap-l> Right
[16:47] <jcastro> yeah so like, it has this microphone that you put where you sit
[16:47] <jcastro> and then they tell you "turn the knobs to this, then hit the button"
[16:47] <czajkowski> snap-l: the loco council uses the team reports
[16:47] <czajkowski> to review teams
[16:47] <jcastro> and it just autotunes all the speakers and the sub
[16:47] <czajkowski> so please do keep them
[16:47] <czajkowski> and don't delete :)
[16:48] <jcastro> no boomy bass either, it's all tight and awesome sounding
[16:48] <snap-l> czajkowski: I'm not going to delete, but I find it's "one more thing" I have to remember.
[16:48] <czajkowski> delegate :)
[16:48] <snap-l> And frankly, it's not something I look forward to completing.
[16:48] <snap-l> czajkowski: Tried that.
[16:49] <jcastro> something worth doing, asking IS for the analytics data on the team report pages.
[16:49] <jcastro> if it's lower than the amount of work being put into it, there's your answer.
[16:49] <snap-l> czajkowski: If I could change the process to allow for the past events / meetings links to have the same weight as a team report, that would make me happy
[16:50] <snap-l> Because as it stands, they're copy / paste.
[16:50] <czajkowski> snap-l: bugs open about this already
[16:50] <czajkowski> just not evenough developers to make it happen
[16:50] <czajkowski> and no point in usuing analytics unfortunately as not every teams does it
[16:50] <czajkowski> but it's the first thing loco council looks at tbh
[16:50] <snap-l> This would be a great way to promote the directory, then.
[16:51] <czajkowski> yup it wpould
[16:51] <czajkowski> adn again a bug is open about it
[16:51] <czajkowski> and people have looked for more developers to help out, can't just be daker always doing the work
[16:51] <snap-l> What's the next action to help make it happen?
[16:51] <czajkowski> a developer to work on the bug
[16:51] <czajkowski> :)
[16:51] <snap-l> What's the bug number?
[16:51] <czajkowski> I dont know it off hand
[16:52] <snap-l> I'll [redacted] look at PHP code if I can make it happen.
[16:52] <czajkowski> if you search the LTP
[16:52] <czajkowski> https://bugs.launchpad.net/loco-team-portal
[16:52] <daker> what ?
[16:52] <snap-l> https://bugs.launchpad.net/loco-team-portal/+bug/605651 ?
[16:52] <czajkowski> https://bugs.launchpad.net/loco-team-portal/+bug/605651
[16:52] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 605651 in LoCo Team Portal "Merge in Loco Reports into loco.ubuntu.com" [High,Triaged]
[16:53] <daker> ah i see
[16:53] <czajkowski> daker: just saying you cant be the one to do all the development
[16:53] <snap-l> I'm not sure how this bug relates to the wiki team reports
[16:54] <czajkowski> anyways I need to work out why my wifi driver refuses to connect to this wifi router whe on this network and I need to kill it and restart the driver every single time
[16:55] <snap-l> This looks more like data about the loco in the report, not about monthly activity.
[16:55] <snap-l> ex. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MichiganTeam/TeamReports/
[17:12] <dholbach> daker, is there a list of high priority things on the LTP right now? or what's going to happen next? :)
[17:12] <dholbach> daker, we didn't talk about the LTP in a long time :)
[17:23] <daker> dholbach: a new version on the way
[17:24] <dholbach> daker, nice
[17:24] <daker> daker: i am just waiting for IS
[17:25] <dholbach> daker, is it https://launchpad.net/loco-team-portal/+milestone/0.3.11?
[17:25] <daker> yep
[17:25] <dholbach> HOLY COW!
[17:26] <daker> :)
[17:26] <dholbach> you've been busy
[17:26] <daker> dholbach: ya now LTP works with django 1.3
[17:26] <daker> thanks to cjohnston
[17:27] <cjohnston> dholbach: you may want to prod IS
[17:27] <dholbach> awesome
[17:27] <dholbach> we should probably all take turns in prodding ;-)
[17:28] <daker> :)
[17:51] <dholbach> I call it a day - see you all tomorrow my friends! :)
