[04:30] <roasted> :D
[12:21] <waltman> Morning.
[12:21] <JonathanD> Hey.
[12:21] <JonathanD> Who is ThomasCorwin.
[12:22] <JonathanD> Oh
[12:22] <JonathanD> Thats the "doing a presentation near pittsburg" guy.
[12:33] <JonathanD> Wonder if he was really looking for me, or for jedijf, since you've communicated with him more jedijf.
[12:35] <waltman> The name sounds familiar.
[12:37] <JonathanD> He emailed the ubuntu pa list a while ago.
[12:38] <JonathanD> About doing some public "teach about ubuntu" thing.
[12:52] <waltman> oh, THAT guy
[12:55] <waltman> pleia2: Today is Penguin Awareness Day. Are you aware of penguins?
[12:56] <waltman> You get $10 off admission to the Philadelphia Zoo today and tomorrow if you dress like a penguin.
[12:56] <JonathanD> What?
[12:57] <JonathanD> Come on, if I dress like a penguin you should let me in free.
[12:57] <waltman> http://brynmawr.patch.com/articles/get-out-visit-a-local-aquarium-for-penguin-awareness-day-96f46766?ncid=newsltuspatc00000001
[12:58] <waltman> But then they'd have to let all the nuns in for free.
[12:58] <JonathanD> That seems like a small price to pay.
[13:01] <waltman> Also James Bond
[13:04] <JonathanD> If james bond showed up at my zoo, I'd let him in free. Penguin day or no.
[13:06] <waltman> Orchestra conductors?
[13:06] <JonathanD> only if they bring the Orchestra
[13:06] <waltman> figure skating announcers?
[13:06] <JonathanD> What I would do, actually.
[13:06] <JonathanD> Free for any penguins, and your not-paid normal admission fee can still be used towards a year pass.
[13:07] <JonathanD> Incentive to sell passes.
[13:08] <waltman> I don't think I need to be too concerned about pleia2's awareness of penguins.
[14:51] <jedijf> JonathanD: he's *all* yours
[15:40] <JonathanD> I don't mind sharing.
[15:58] <roasted> :D
[17:07] <pleia2> penguins <3
[19:55] <roasted> hello!
[19:55] <roasted> someone give me their opinion on a few pending storage models I'm looking at before my head explodes
[19:55] <roasted> 12.04 headless server, dedicated OS drive, for storage I'm looking at...
[19:56] <roasted> 4x2TB WD Reds @ 500 dollars flat in RAID 6 configuration, OR 2x3TB Seagate HDDs in RAID 1 @ 280 dollars.
[19:56] <roasted> (I've also cosnidered not doing RAID 1 and just rsync data from one HDD to another nightly in an effort to restore a higher level of "backup" vs redundancy.
[19:56] <roasted> )
[20:07] <ChinnoDog> You can do better than rsync for your backup. Use Crashplan to backup to a local hard drive. You don't need to pay for cloud storage to use the app and the external hard disk doesn't need to be fast.
[20:08] <roasted> What advantages would crashplan give me over rsync?
[20:09] <ChinnoDog> compressed deduped backups in real time
[20:09] <roasted> er - and rsync doesn't support that?
[20:09] <ChinnoDog> They aren't real time and you can't support multiple levels of backups easily
[20:10] <roasted> well, even still, the point is the hdd's wouldn't be raid'd
[20:10] <roasted> but drive B would serve as a backup to drive A
[20:10] <roasted> leaving A running by itself, so if it dies I WOULD be offline (whcih is why rsync would be nice beecause then I can put drive B in A's spot and be running in minutes by changing the mount point)
[20:11] <roasted> RMA the failed drive, get the new one in, put in drive B's spot, and rsync accordingy.
[20:11] <roasted> It's the best combination of backups vs redundancy I can find, even though it's not real time redundant much at all.
[20:11] <roasted> but the 500 dollar price tag is unreal to justify. I have my first child on the way. I just can't stomach dumping 500 on hard drives for my home server. :(
[20:12] <roasted> but I definitely need more space and I definitely want some sort of backup or redundancy
[20:18] <ChinnoDog> My backup plan if the data drive dies is to go around the corner to Microcenter and get a new hard drive. If the apartment burns down I'll get my backup from Crashplan central.
[20:19] <roasted> So you're not a big RAID guy?
[20:23] <ChinnoDog> Only raid 0. :-) My home server doesn't have the uptime requirements of a corporate environment nor the IT budget for parts that would go with that.
[20:24] <ChinnoDog> Quality hard drives that are mounted and ventilated properly do not die very frequently.
[20:27] <roasted> yeah, I hear you.
[20:27] <ChinnoDog> On the other hand, 15k RPM SCSI drives mounted in the upper 1/3 of a rack in a data center can get mightly toasty and have much higher usage than a disk at home. Multiply the number of disks in the data center by the failure rate in this environment and using RAID is a good idea so that you aren't constantly putting out fires.
[20:27] <roasted> Yeah, but corporate environments also have corporate budgets.
[20:27] <roasted> Plus if my server is offline, I don't lose money. I just gain a level of frustration.
[20:28] <roasted> I just want to fuss with my server as little as possible, which is why RAID 6 or something looked appealing to me.
[20:28] <roasted> But there IS a level of added functionality that comes from changing Drive B's mount point to Drive A, in the event Drive A dies.
[20:29] <roasted> I can be up and running in a minute.
[20:29] <roasted> Not to mention the fact that doing daily rsync's allows me to pull up data off the server in the event I ruined said file on my computer.
[20:29] <roasted> eh
[20:31] <ChinnoDog> Not using RAID is less expensive than using it. The cost of a replacement drive in even one years time that matches the size of the other volumes will be much less.
[20:31] <ChinnoDog> I have a slow USB 1.5TB drive I use for backups
[20:32] <roasted> But in my case, I'm debating between RAID 1 mirror or no mirror and rsync, however we're still talking 2x3TB HDDs.
[20:32] <roasted> So both situations cost the same.
[20:32] <roasted> I'm just wondering if a mirror makes sense, or if utilizing rsync (which removes a degree of real time redundancy, but grants me a level of backup protection) outweights the need for a raid mirror
