[00:11] <zequence> amd64 raring uninstallable. I think it might be for all ubuntu flavors
[00:16] <zequence> seems like it's a bug in ubiquity that has to do with a certain amount of pre-existing ubuntu installs on several partitions
[00:19] <len-dt> Somebody else ran into that too.
[00:31] <zequence> Yeah, found a bug report for it. Apparently cjwatson was requesting logs from a debug mode install. Will try that now
[00:45] <zequence> Whenever you do something smart, you find a bug
[00:46] <zequence> ..or stupid
[00:50] <zequence> I guess I can go ahead and install with netinstall for now
[00:50] <zequence> Just not optimal
[00:52] <zequence> ..if I can find it
[00:57] <zequence> found it
[01:12] <zequence> Seems like it's nog ubiquity at all, but the partioner
[01:19] <zequence> Well, seems like I'm one install short. Annoying
[01:19] <zequence> gn
[09:10] <zequence> funny. today the netinstall worked
[09:10] <zequence> maybe my computer was just being sleepy and confused yesterday, just like me?
[09:49] <zequence> and ubiquity also worked, but only once. Arrgh, no debug on that!
[18:35] <ScottL> i added synfigstudio to the graphcis and video seeds. whenever the metas get updated is okay (i think)
[18:35] <ScottL> ..
[18:36] <ScottL> micahg, are you going to uds in may? i think i should be going and i look forward to seeing you again
[18:36] <ScottL> micahg, also, while i'm thinking about it, do you want to discuss a plan for someone else to update the meta files (if you feel comfortable with someone else doing it, that is)
[18:43] <zequence> I think the best thing would be for one of us to get upload rights, but the question is, how soon would that be realistically possible?
