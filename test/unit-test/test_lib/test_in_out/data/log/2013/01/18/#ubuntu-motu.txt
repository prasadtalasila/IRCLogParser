[03:18] <ScottK> TheLordOfTime: Kubuntu and many other flavors are LTS.  I don't know where you get the idea it's Ubuntu only.
[03:25] <TheLordOfTime> ScottK, i was told by someone else it was only Ubuntu that got the LTS tag
[03:25] <TheLordOfTime> they gave me bad info
[03:27] <ScottK> OK

[19:55] <quidnunc> Is prevu no longer maintained?
[19:56] <Laney> no
[19:56] <Laney> it was removed after oneiric
[19:57] <quidnunc> Laney: Is there a replacement?
[19:57] <ScottK> backportpackage is probably closest
[19:57] <Laney> backportpackage in ubuntu-dev-tools does pretty much the same job
[19:58] <Laney> apparently we still have wiki pages talking about prevu
[19:58] <quidnunc> ScottK, Laney: I can't build local source with backportpackage right?
[19:59] <quidnunc> I want pbuilder for that, right?
[20:00] <jtaylor> yes
[20:00] <Laney> backportpackage can call pbuilder or sbuild for you
[20:00] <jtaylor> or cowbuilder
[20:01] <Laney> ...
[20:01] <quidnunc> Laney: Yes but it can only build source fetched from a particular release not source fetched from elsewhere or modified locally
[20:06] <ScottK> Right, but if you've got it locally, pbuilder is all you need.
[20:07] <quidnunc> ScottK: Thanks. I always used prevu for everything so I am not familiar with nuances between different package building tools
[23:15] <Adri2000> siretart: hi. I've got one of the packages I maintain in debian that fails to build in experimental because of "/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libavcodec.so.53: undefined reference to `ff_sqrt_tab@LIBAVUTIL_51'". it does not depend directly on libav*. do you think you can help?
[23:52] <xnox> Adri2000: URL to full build log is usally preffered for build failures.
[23:53] <xnox> otherwise it's hard to understand what/where/why is hapeening
