[18:47] <dkessel> balloons, are you there?
[19:11] <dkessel> FYI: I just opened autopilot bug 1096432 and bug 1096430
[19:11] <ubot5> bug 1096432 in Autopilot "docs are unclear on how to enable "autopilot support"" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1096432
[19:11] <ubot5> bug 1096430 in Autopilot "autopilot vis logs connection problem, but does not tell which application is causing it" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1096430
[19:15] <robotfuel> dkessel: I can help you out with autopilot questions
[19:16] <dkessel> ok. robotfuel, what does "an application has autopilot support" mean? it's in the docs and it could be more precise.
[19:19] <robotfuel> do you have a link to the page in the doc you are looking at? for instance if you are running a qt app you can run from the command line '<qt-app-name> -testability' and you will be able to see the app in autopilot vis
[19:20] <dkessel> http://unity.ubuntu.com/autopilot/tutorial/running_ap.html
[19:20] <dkessel> ok, and with gtk apps? the same?
[19:23] <robotfuel> dkessel: no gtk apps are different, I'd have to look at the autopilot source to see how gtk apps get launched.
[19:25] <dkessel> robotfule, but is a gtk app automatically somehow "autopilot introspection enabled", or are changes in the apps required to enable autopilot introspection?
[19:26] <thomi> robotfuel: no changes are required in the Gtk app - it should work as long as you're using Gtk 2, 3, or Qt4, Qt5
[19:26] <thomi> for Gtk, we use a Gtk plugin to do the autopilot magic
[19:26] <robotfuel> dkessel: if you run it in an autopilot test yes
[19:27] <dkessel> robotfuel: ok. so i guess the only enabled app is unity at the moment?
=== Ursinha_ is now known as Ursinha
[19:40] <robotfuel> dkessel: For anything other than unity the application under test must be started from within the autopilot test. (for gtk apps)
[19:41] <dkessel> robotfuel, ok, thanks
[20:26] <dkessel> ok, so i made a start with the test for file-roller. now i don't understand why autopilot won't list or run my test...
[20:27] <dkessel> my autopilot test branch is at: lp:~d-kessel/ubuntu-autopilot-tests/file-roller
[20:50] <dkessel> thomi, do you want/have time to look at it?
[20:50] <thomi> dkessel: I can take a look at it tomorrow, but it's my Sunday here at the moment, I just happened to be at my laptop
[20:51] <thomi> dkessel: what timezone are you in?
[20:51] <dkessel> thomi: ok. I'm in GMT+1
[20:52] <thomi> dkessel: OK, hit me up any time during the week and I'll be happy to help - although I'm in GMT +12 (or is it +13), so finding someone in the states or europe might be a better bet
[20:53] <dkessel> thomi, I understand. maybe balloons has an idea when he is back...
