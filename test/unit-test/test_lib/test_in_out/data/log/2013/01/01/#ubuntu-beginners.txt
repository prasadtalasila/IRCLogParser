[08:08] <Em_> I just installed Ubuntu 12.10 on my Netbook (Lenovo G480 Intel Core i5, 400GB HDD, 4GB RAM, 1GB GPU). The distro is already installed; however some of the hardware drivers like the GPU, Ethernet, are not automatically installed leaving my unable to connect to the Internet. I really thought that all my notebook's hardware drivers will be installed automatically with the OS, so how do I install it without Internet connection?

[16:04] <pip__> Hi, what is the Ubuntu website counting down to at the moment?
[18:52] <dmanzo> Hello, I need some help. Is this the right place?
[18:54] <holstein> sure dmanzo , you can try here.. just ask and if one of the volunteers can help, they will
[18:56] <dmanzo> Thanks. I was trying to install Rosetta Stone with Wine but when I run Rosetta Stone I get an error and am forced to quit. I'm using 12.04 x64. I'm not sure what to do.
[18:57] <holstein> dmanzo: maybe ask the vendor of the software to create a version for the operating system you are using
[18:57] <holstein> there are wine support channels
[18:57] <holstein> its doesnt have to work
[18:58] <dmanzo> I know people have gotten it to run through Wine before. But thanks, I guess I'll search for those channels.
[18:58] <holstein> http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=1867 is what i reference
[18:59] <holstein> dmanzo: if you know folks who have it working, ask them how to get it working
[19:01] <holstein> i tyically just get the installer .exe and try it
[19:02] <holstein> i dont run anything in wine for other than testing though
[19:47] <thewrath> hello all
[19:47] <thewrath> i have a problem with a virtual host
[19:48] <thewrath> my default virtual host has the following content: http://pastebin.com/QsMktESj
[19:49] <thewrath> the melandchris13.com content is the following: http://pastebin.com/yLUBDQLK
[19:50] <thewrath> why is melandchris13.com not working?
[20:02] <holstein> thewrath: i usually just forward in godaddy
[20:03] <thewrath> holstein: what do you mean
[20:03] <thewrath> i own the server but the domain is through goaddy
[20:03] <thewrath> *godaddy
[20:03] <holstein> sure.. thats why im saying i usually just do a forward from there
[20:04] <thewrath> because i have not forward doamins before
[20:04] <thewrath> how does that do?
[20:04] <holstein> it just forwards... and godaddy does OK at it
[20:05] <holstein> otherwise, i think you are going to want to look at dns records and all that
[20:06] <holstein> i think its more complex than just adding a text file on your server
[20:06] <thewrath> i have changed the ips for the domain
[20:06] <holstein> that would be a question for a server guy.. there are several in my LUG, but none are around
[20:06] <holstein> thewrath: i literally just click the "forward" button and forward, and it works
[20:07] <holstein> thewrath: i changed records on a few namecheap domains to point at a few blogspot blogs
[20:07] <thewrath> oh ok
[20:07] <holstein> from now on, im just going to do forwards from godaddy... its so much easier to deal with and maintain
[20:07] <thewrath> that is not going to work
[20:07] <thewrath> lol
[20:07] <thewrath> if you change the ip addressses
[20:08] <holstein> sure
[20:08] <thewrath> and then set up virtual name host
[20:08] <holstein> you can get something like dyndns and update the ip when/if it changes and forward to that
[20:08] <holstein> but, im sure you can get someone to help you setup the way you you are trying to set it up
[20:09] <holstein> i woud try godaddy
[20:09] <holstein> would*
[20:09] <thewrath> k
[21:58] <thewrath> anyone else?
[22:11] <newbish> My apt-get is giving me an error of dynamic mmap running out of room.  It tells me to increase the size of APT::Cache-Limit, where do I do that?
[22:28] <newbish> I've been looking around in /etc/apt/ but haven't been able to find the exact location of APT::Cache-Limit.
