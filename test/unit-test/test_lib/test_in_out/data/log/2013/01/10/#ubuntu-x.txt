[00:04] <bryce> RAOF, got it, thanks.
=== Amaranthus is now known as Amaranth
[07:36] <tjaalton> bryce: I'm thinking about defaulting to sna now, ickle recommended it too
[07:54] <tjaalton> so robert ancell uploaded weston 1.0.3 already..
[07:54] <tjaalton> double work
[08:35] <bryce> tjaalton, do we have sna on in edgers?
[08:37] <tjaalton> bryce: dunno
[08:37] <tjaalton> but people have tested it with good results
[08:40] <tjaalton> doesn't look like it's enabled there
[08:42] <bryce> one lesson I learned with exa and uxa is that before we switch to a new tech you only hear from people for whom the tech works great.  Those who have problems with it will just ignore it...
[08:43] <tjaalton> sure
[08:43] <bryce> tjaalton, I suppose we could switch it on for a week and evaluate the fallback via bug reports
[08:43] <tjaalton> yeah
[08:43] <bryce> (assuming apport is still catching crashes and freezes for us)
[08:43] <tjaalton> it's been rather quiet :)
[08:43] <bryce> suspiciously
[08:44] <tjaalton> 10 bugs on raring..
[08:44] <tjaalton> against our packages
[08:44] <tjaalton> which is like 1/4 of the bugs against quantal at this point
[08:44] <bryce> yeah.  of course we haven't updated many packages...
[08:44] <bryce> anyway, I have raring systems at hand, I'll do some sleuthing tomorrow and make sure it's still working.
[08:45] <tjaalton> I've tried it on sandybridge, heard good results on i915 & i945
[08:45] <bryce> for sna...  even if we go ahead and do a 1 week eval, I think I'd still like to see it guinea pigged on edgers for a bit, maybe even a call for testing
[08:46] <tjaalton> edgers pulls all kinds of crap
[08:46] <tjaalton> rather do it on another ppa
[08:47] <bryce> yeah that'd be fine.
[08:48] <bryce> or even just have folks manually switch it on in their xorg.conf?
[08:48] <bryce> "Copy this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  If that leads to any graphics problems, delete the file and let us know."
[08:49] <bryce> give it a week... if we hear nothing serious then flip it on for everyone for a week
[08:50] <tjaalton> alright
[08:52] <tjaalton> huh, reading the forums really makes you sad :)
[08:56] <bryce> phoronix?
[08:56] <tjaalton> ubuntuforums this time
[08:58] <bryce> sheesh: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTI3MTI
[08:58] <tjaalton> yeah
[08:58] <tjaalton> that was amusing to read, again
[09:23] <tjaalton> tseliot: hey, wanted to ask if nvidia-current will go away and instead just use -NNN in the future?
[09:27] <tseliot> tjaalton: yes, it's exactly as you say
[09:27] <tjaalton> tseliot: right, what I had suspected :)
[09:27] <tseliot> I'll work on transitional packages today
[09:27] <tjaalton> pinged #ubuntu-release about the -173 update to quantal, noticed it's been on the queue since nov 22nd :/
[09:28] <tseliot> ah, thanks
[09:35] <tjaalton> tseliot: also, during your holidays I uploaded the nvidia-96 update, it's now verification-done so should hit precise soon
[09:36] <tseliot> tjaalton: ah, good, I'll sync my git repository then
[09:37] <tjaalton> hope it's the last upload ;)
[09:37] <tseliot> hehe, right
[09:40] <tjaalton> will the nvidia-experimental-* packages stay?
[09:43] <tjaalton> guess they're obsoleted by this change
[09:48] <tseliot> tjaalton: they should be there only in precise
[09:48] <tjaalton> right

[11:14] <mlankhorst> bryce: oh my ;P
[11:15] <mlankhorst> my personal favorite is the tf2 post currently, he didn't even try and copied that verbatim
[14:25] <Sarvatt> tjaalton: June 29th, 2012: SNA is now on by default on intel. 
[14:26] <Sarvatt> its been on by default for a long time now and the only complaints since have been when I accidentally made UXA the default one upload :P
[14:28] <tjaalton> Sarvatt: --enable-sna is not the same as --with-default-accel=sna
[14:28] <tjaalton> oh you mean edgers?
[14:28] <tjaalton> the changelog lies about it then
[14:28] <Sarvatt> override_dh_auto_configure:
[14:28] <Sarvatt> 	dh_auto_configure -- --enable-sna --enable-uxa --with-default-accel=sna --with-builderstring="$(SOURCE_NAME) $(SOURCE_VERSION) ($(BUILDER))"
[14:28] <tjaalton> basically doesn't mention that
[14:29] <tjaalton> and I trusted the changelog, boo :)
[14:29] <Sarvatt> oh the hook got screwed up
[14:29] <tjaalton> anyway, I'll create a wikipage for people to report success on
[14:29] <Sarvatt> changelog part, i updated the man page last upload and screwed it up :)
[14:29] <tjaalton> hehe
[14:29] <tjaalton> 16:21 < cjwatson> This will be painful
[14:30] <tjaalton> 16:22 < cjwatson> hate you all
[14:30] <tjaalton> :)
[14:30] <tjaalton> colin doesn't like the pain the renamed stack causes on the installer
[14:30] <mlankhorst> wait a minute
[14:30] <tjaalton> relax
[14:31] <Sarvatt> everyone hates the renamed stack, not like we had a choice :)
[14:31] <tjaalton> right
[14:39] <mlankhorst> true
[14:39] <mlankhorst> guess I'll file a bug for the mesa -dev issue and get it sru'd
[14:42] <tjaalton> yeah
[15:15] <mlankhorst> https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mesa/+bug/1098215 ?
[15:15] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1098215 in mesa (Ubuntu Precise) "installing libqt4-opengl-dev uninstalls renamed stack" [Critical,In progress]
[15:15] <mlankhorst> will do some more testing before I upload the fix
[15:17] <tjaalton> yep, looks good
[15:17] <tjaalton> don't forget to subscribe ubuntu-sru once done uploading
[15:19] <mlankhorst> hm I think I'll leave out libgbm-dev, I think the api on that one might change and nothing rdepends on it anyway
[15:20] <tjaalton> ok
[16:08] <tjaalton> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Testing/IntelSNA
[16:08] <tjaalton> comments welcome
[16:09] <tjaalton> or edits :)
[16:09] <tjaalton> dinner ->
[16:09] <mlankhorst> sounds good
[16:47] <tjaalton> updated the wiki-page again
[16:50] <tjaalton> I'd like to send the email to ubuntu-devel@ today
[16:51] <tjaalton> then again, the wiki can be edited later :)
[16:56] <tjaalton> Sarvatt: mind proofreading the page?
[16:57] <tjaalton> actually, I'll wait and let bryce comment on it too
[16:58] <tjaalton> bryce: so I wrote the wiki page, and email ready to be sent
[17:00] <Sarvatt> tjaalton: sure thing, one sec, testing this bcmwl package out
[17:21] <Sarvatt> tjaalton: looks good to me, is SNA backend needed?
[17:21] <Sarvatt> in the results column
[17:22] <Sarvatt> I guess thats one way to make sure people verify they are actually using SNA
[17:23] <tjaalton> yeah :)
[17:24] <bjsnider> wouldn't xorg.0.log say so?
[17:24] <tjaalton> although it comes from the same output, so..
[17:24] <tjaalton> that's where it's from
[17:27] <tjaalton> dropped the backend bit
[18:26] <bryce> tjaalton, reading
[18:46] <bryce> tjaalton, looks good!  I made a few minor copy edits.  Also, I put the xorg.conf as an actual attached file.
[18:46] <bryce> I suspect people are going to be more comfortable copying an entire file into place, than with editing xorg.conf's.  And most Intel users won't have a file to conflict.
[18:47] <tjaalton> bryce: ah, good point. and thanks!
[18:47] <tjaalton> the first version just cat'd the file in place, but that seemed a bit risky :)
[18:47] <bryce> right, now to retest on my own hw.  :-)
[18:47] <tjaalton> Sarvatt: fix your lp id there :)
[18:48] <bryce> tjaalton, ah, I assumed those were yours!  sorry
[18:48] <tjaalton> oh, hehe
[18:50] <tjaalton> yeah I'll test it on X61 too once I'm done with vag-com & XP..
[18:51] <tjaalton> (i965GM)
[18:59] <tjaalton> bryce: i'm reformatting it a bit, done editing?
[19:00] <bryce> yep, go for it
[19:04] <tjaalton> added example output for uname/lspci
[19:05] <tjaalton> ok, I'll send the email and post to the forum
[19:05] <bryce> tjaalton, awesome
[19:07] <tjaalton> just happened to read this earlier too :) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2103414
[19:09] <tjaalton> there
[19:10] <tjaalton> let's see how long until it's on phoronix frontpage
[19:10] <bryce> heh
[19:10] <jcristau> tjaalton: 'lspci -nn -s 0:2.0'
[19:10] <jcristau> (all intel hw has the gfx at that slot afaik)
[19:11] <tjaalton> jcristau: ahh..
[19:11] <jcristau> saves some grepping
[19:11] <tjaalton> and the chance of running it on a hybrid laptop
[19:11] <tjaalton> didn't know how to best handle such case
[19:12] <tjaalton> if it's always on 0:2:0 then that would solve it
[19:12] <bryce> tjaalton, there's also xpci, although I can't guarantee it's going to work properly on the newest gfx cards
[19:13] <tjaalton> ImportError: No module named taskhelm
[19:13] <tjaalton> :)
[19:13] <tjaalton> on quantal
[19:13] <bryce> tjaalton, yeah, need to fix that.  should already work on raring though
[19:13] <tjaalton> ok
[19:36] <shadeslayer> tjaalton: silly question, but could this http://wstaw.org/m/2013/01/10/plasma-desktopS17003.png be caused by enabling SNA?
[19:37]  * shadeslayer didn't see this earlier
[19:37] <shadeslayer> ( 2 arrows in the taskbar, the one at the bottom is bogus )
[19:37] <tjaalton> shadeslayer: no idea, try without to be sure
[19:38] <shadeslayer> yeah will do that to be 100% sure
[19:41] <tjaalton> raring has a new pixman too
[19:43] <shadeslayer> no idea what that is
[19:43] <shadeslayer> I also don't have proper instructions to reproduce the bug, so will get back if I notice it with UXA
[19:44] <shadeslayer> ah okay
[19:44] <shadeslayer> can reproduce it in UXA as well
[19:44] <tjaalton> ok, check what version of libpixman-1-0 you have
[19:45] <shadeslayer> 0.26.0-3
[19:46] <tjaalton> not that then
[19:46] <tjaalton> same in quantal
[19:46] <shadeslayer> yep, haven't upgraded in a bit
[19:47] <tjaalton> there's a new intel driver too, uploaded earlier this week
[19:48] <shadeslayer> yeah, I guess I'll leave it to upgrade tonight
[19:48] <tjaalton> added a new first step to the page, upgrade to current raring
[19:48] <shadeslayer> :D
[19:49] <tjaalton> details..
[21:57] <tjaalton> first corruption bug with sna :)
[22:13]  * bryce installs chromium
[22:17] <bryce> huh, repro'd
[22:18] <tjaalton> what hw?
[22:19] <bryce> 2a42, same gfx as echidnaman
[22:20] <bryce> Dell Latitude 13
[22:21] <tjaalton> ok, I'll try on snb
[22:22] <Sarvatt> not happening on snb or ivb here
[22:23] <tjaalton> not here eitehr
[22:23] <tjaalton> either
[22:23] <tjaalton> shadeslayer: which hw did you have?
[22:24] <shadeslayer> 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller [8086:0116] (rev 09)
[22:24] <tjaalton> ah, so it's not the same bug
[22:24] <bryce> posted my screenshot @ #1098334
[22:24] <RAOF> To Phoronix's great surprise, sna isn't a flawless beacon of speed and stability? ☺
[22:24] <tjaalton> well, not on every hw incarnation ;)
[22:24] <tjaalton> it seems
[22:25] <bryce> RAOF, I'm sure after we switch to it, they'll post an article lambasting us
[22:27] <shadeslayer> oh oh
[22:27] <bryce> hmm, seems to be peculiar to reddit; other sites don't exhibit the behavior.  doesn't seem to affect firefox
[22:27] <shadeslayer> tjaalton: bug 1098334 has been reproduced by JT
[22:27] <shadeslayer> one sec
[22:27] <ubottu> bug 1098334 in xserver-xorg-video-intel (Ubuntu) "Font corruption in Chromium tab bar using Intel SNA" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1098334
[22:27] <shadeslayer> ah he reported it @_@
[22:27] <tjaalton> right :)
[22:28] <shadeslayer> cannot reproduce on gooogle-chrome btw
[22:28] <shadeslayer> the proprietary one
[22:28] <shadeslayer> but could easily be because of hw differences
[22:28] <tjaalton> ok, so this one is not a critical one then
[22:29] <tjaalton> probably happens only on gen4
[22:30] <tjaalton> or the ones using "Broadwater/Crestline" backend
[22:43] <bryce> yeah I set it to medium
[22:44] <bryce> it's a pretty common chipset, although a tad old
[22:46] <jcristau> hey don't call my laptop old.  it's just 4 years old. :)
[22:50] <tjaalton> ah, gm45 is actually newer than 965
[22:51] <jcristau> yes
[22:53] <tjaalton> somehow mixed it with 945
