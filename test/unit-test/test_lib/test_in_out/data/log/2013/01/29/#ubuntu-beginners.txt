[14:35] <nihil_2013> Is it possible to download the entire Ubuntu Wiki for offline use without using a morally unacceptable amount of bandwidth?
[14:53] <geirha> nihil_2013: Good question. Try asking #ubuntu-wiki or #ubuntu-doc
[14:53] <geirha> I'd also be interested to know what the answer will be
[15:17] <nihil_2013> Thanks :-)
[19:13] <lagreca> Hi! Pepperflash's Chrome Stable is showing colored artifacts when playing youtube videos. Can it be solved? Thanks. PS: UBUNTU 12.04.1
[19:13] <lagreca> The same doesn't happen in unity 2d.

[19:50] <ShadowAkira> Hello! To whom can i talk? I have  a problem adding new screen resolution to ubuntu :(
[19:51] <holstein> !ask | ShadowAkira
[19:51] <ubot2> ShadowAkira: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[19:51] <holstein> ShadowAkira: i would just install and try arandr
[19:52] <ShadowAkira> oh! nice :P After using cvt, xrandr --newmode and --addmode i kinda got stuck with the following error X Error of failed request:  BadMatch (invalid parameter attributes)
[19:52] <ShadowAkira>   Major opcode of failed request:  141 (RANDR)
[19:52] <ShadowAkira>   Minor opcode of failed request:  18 (RRAddOutputMode)
[19:52] <ShadowAkira>   Serial number of failed request:  55
[19:52] <ShadowAkira>   Current serial number in output stream:  56
[19:53] <holstein> ShadowAkira: i would try arandr
[19:53] <holstein> ShadowAkira: sometimes i use a live CD such as knoppix to setup the desktop/desktops, and i copy the xorg.conf
[20:15] <r4y> I fixed my problem
[20:15] <r4y> I was able fix the whole flash and html5 video problem with both Ubuntu 12 and 10 and the answers are different
[20:16] <r4y> For Ubuntu 12 I installed synaptic package manager and completely removed flash but left ubuntu restricted extras
[20:18] <r4y> for ubuntu 10 somehow there was a file under usr/lib/ called flash-plugin and when I had followed what to do from this link:
[20:18] <r4y> http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linuxquestions-org-member-success-stories-23/getting-flash-plug-in-to-work-with-older-cpus-4175420481/
[20:20] <r4y> I missed that I needed to put it into usr/lib/flash-plugin and thoughtlessly put it under usr/lib/firefox and usr/lib/mozilla-firefox and usr/lib/mozilla
[20:21] <r4y> this time I had to delete the file called flash-plugin and make a folder called flash-plugin and put libflashplayer.so file as suggsted in the link I just posted and bam Ubuntu 10.04 works with all videos
[20:25] <Unit193> ...Can't you just install adobe-flashplugin from the partner repos?  That's always worked for me, and pulls in security updates as well.
[20:26] <r4y> nope
[20:27] <r4y> Maybe now I can, but atleast I have a way around the problems I was having
[20:28] <r4y> I should try that out
[20:28] <r4y> I will be back
[20:33] <r4y> OK, to make this test work out I had to hand remove what I copied and did in the filesystem and make sure a youtube video didn't work
[20:34] <r4y> What exactly should I install?, Do I use the Ubuntu software Center? or Synaptic Package Manager?, Also I am running Ubuntu 10.04
[20:34] <r4y> Will I be using the flash installer and then going to the adobe site? or?
[20:36] <Unit193> !partner | Add that if you don't have it already, then adobe-flashplugin
[20:36] <ubot2> Add that if you don't have it already, then adobe-flashplugin: Canonical's partner repositories provide a location for software vendors to publish applications. The repo itself can be added by running this in a !terminal: « sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ $(lsb_release -sc) partner" »
[20:37] <r4y> so don't go to the adobe website at all?
[20:37] <Unit193> Nope.
[20:37] <r4y> I need to make sure I am clear on what you are saying
[20:37] <r4y> So install the flash installer then install the package adobe-flashplugin both from
[20:38] <r4y> ubuntu software center
[20:38] <Unit193> Only adobe-flashplugin.
[20:39] <r4y> flash 19 version 11? or installer?, or non free?, sorry ha ha ha
[20:40] <r4y> I meant flash 10 version 11
[20:40] <r4y> I think you mean flash 10 version 11
[20:41] <r4y> Or you mean from synaptic
[20:41] <r4y> OK, I see sorry
[20:42] <r4y> Um, I need to go because I am using chatzilla which is a firefox plugin just to make sure this goes as planned.
[20:42] <Unit193> 11.2.202.261-0lucid1, should be.
[20:47] <r4y> OK, sorry I messed up and had to start over
[20:48] <r4y> so the package is adobe-flashplugin
[20:48] <r4y> ?
[20:48] <r4y> Is that all that you suggested to do?
[20:48] <Unit193> Yep.
[20:48] <r4y> OK, here is where I am at
[20:49] <r4y> This video plays for instance:
[20:49] <r4y> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf1r-oPpkmI
[20:49] <r4y> but this video doesn't:
[20:49] <r4y> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5Otla5157c
[20:49] <r4y> Checking filesystem
[20:50] <Unit193> Yep, first is html5, second is flash.
[20:51] <r4y> There is no folder called flash-plugin
[20:51] <Unit193> You can see the packages list with  dpkg -L adobe-flashplugin
[20:51] <r4y> My computer got slow for a second trying to look at the filesystem but no greying out sorry
[20:52] <r4y> I need to check something
[20:53] <r4y> And there is no file called flash-plugin under usr/lib/
[20:53] <r4y> OK, sorry
[20:54] <r4y> Ah
[20:55] <r4y> The folder is called adobe-flashplugin not flash-plugin
[20:55] <r4y> Mabe that is the problem
[20:55] <r4y> I am going to rename it
[20:55] <Unit193> http://pastebin.com/cSdAt1Yb That's what I have, and it works.
[20:56] <Unit193> There are a few alternatives.rc links to it.
[20:57] <r4y> http://pastebin.com/zw1NCaiD
[20:58] <r4y> Right I remember seeing links but I didn't mess with any of them and didn't know how or if I should
[20:58] <Unit193> ls -lh /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins/  points back to where it should for me.
[20:59] <r4y> http://pastebin.com/Kbvas89r
[21:02] <Unit193> You restarted firefox, and no flash?  Weird.  Any other browsers installed?
[21:03] <r4y> Yes Chrome and Chromium
[21:03] <Unit193> Which should have their own.
[21:03] <r4y> Completely remove with synaptic package manager?
[21:03] <Unit193> Chromium use pepperflash or no?
[21:04] <r4y> I don't know, but chrome should but neither worked for me
[21:04] <Unit193> And no, they shouldn't mess it up.
[21:04] <Unit193> Something is very weird...
[21:04] <r4y> I should run a test with them for the videos I have shown again just in case I guess
[21:05] <Unit193> Well, if you don't pull it up, whatever method you used the first time...
[21:07] <r4y> None of them play
[21:09] <r4y> Maybe Ubuntu 10.04 has to use the path /usr/lib/flash-plugin where as Ubuntu 12.04 uses a different path?, Or I am not sure but it's what worked for me
[21:10] <r4y> I use the command gksudo nautilus to make that change under the filesystem so I don't make the wrong mistake
[21:11] <r4y> Well, I don't know what's going on but you are better then me at Linux so I don't want to ramble and talk in circles, LOL
[21:14] <r4y> TY for trying, perhaps if you were sitting behind this keybaord things would be a different story
[21:14] <Unit193> So wondering, why are you sticking with Lucid?  If you don't like Unity, have you checked out the others?
[21:16] <r4y> I just don't want to go there. I don't want to make war at all, it's really not in my nature, I just like it better because of reasons
[21:16] <r4y> I don't want to feel as if I can't change but that's how some would feel about this choice of mine
[21:16] <r4y> It's easier to make launchers for one
[21:17] <r4y> The layout is the same, lol
[21:17] <r4y> appearance is how I want it
[21:17] <r4y> and other little things I can't remember but there are reasons I am sure
[21:17] <Unit193> Well, just thinking that support ends in April...
[21:18] <r4y> I know, well there is also the spin off but I haven't tried it
[21:19] <Unit193> MATE?  If I were you and liked Gnome, I'd just take a quick look at LXDE or Xfce. :)
[21:20]  * Unit193 just giving ideas. :)
[21:21] <r4y> I can't find the link I had
[21:22] <r4y> Ya, there a lot of options out there
[21:23] <r4y> http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/download/
[21:24] <r4y> Well this is the link I remember:
[21:24] <r4y> http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/
[21:25] <r4y> I think I should start trying these out
[21:25] <r4y> Any links I should follow for your suggestions?
[21:25] <r4y> Sorry for my bad typing
[21:26] <Unit193> If I were going to stick with *ubuntu, I'd get something official, like...
[21:26] <Unit193> !lubuntu
[21:26] <ubot2> lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.
[21:26] <Unit193> !xubuntu
[21:26] <ubot2> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce as the desktop environment. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org/ - To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop » - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
[21:26] <Unit193> !kubuntu
[21:26] <ubot2> Kubuntu is the Ubuntu flavour using KDE Software and the KDE Plasma Workspaces.  See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support join  #kubuntu - See also !kde
[21:27] <r4y> I tried kde and wasn't happy but maybe I am wrong, no it was on Ubuntu it's self from the packages, not a CD of kde Ubuntu
[21:27] <r4y> I am not sure though
[21:28] <r4y> It was terminal based or something
[21:28] <Unit193> Everyone has their own preferences, mine would be different than yours, so KDE may very well not be for you. :)
[21:30] <r4y> AM I wrong?, is there any gui user friendness to the kde version of Ubuntu?
[21:30] <r4y> I mean by default
[21:30] <r4y> not just ui
[21:30] <Unit193> Kubuntu, http://kubuntu.org
[21:31] <r4y> I bookmarked it already, I will look sorry
[21:31] <r4y> Ah, I guess I was wrong then
[21:32] <r4y> OK, I should start trying, TY for the help
[21:32] <Unit193> Sure thing!  Hope you find one you like!
[21:32] <Unit193> Try a few live cds, see if you can find one.
[21:32] <r4y> I will
[21:32] <r4y> Have a good day
[21:33] <Unit193> You as well.
[21:33] <r4y> TY
[22:27] <r4y> I am looking for Ubuntu GNOME Shell Remix 12.04 (((torrent))) to test out
[22:27] <r4y> Is this a trustworthy link
[22:27] <r4y> https://torrentz.eu/ub/ubuntu+12.04+gnome+shell+remix-q
[22:28] <Unit193> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGNOME/ReleaseNotes/12.10?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=ubuntu-gnome-12.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent That should be.
[22:28] <Unit193> http://ftp.acc.umu.se/mirror/gnome.org/misc/ubuntu-gnome-remix/
[22:29] <r4y> Well I was hoping for version 12.04 bing long term then again I wonder about this
[22:32] <r4y> What do you think about support of Ubuntu 12.04 for this version compared to 12.10?, Is it perhaps like the Long Term releases of the normal Ubuntu or maybe it will not matter in the long run?
[22:33] <Unit193> It would appear that it isn't, not listed on their site and I'd guess Gnome shell would be more complete in the newer version anyway.
[22:33]  * Unit193 doesn't know, never used gnome-shell.
=== yofel_ is now known as yofel
[22:34] <Unit193> According to their channel topic at #ubuntu-gnome, 12.10 was their first release.
[22:35] <r4y> http://ubuntu-gs-remix.sourceforge.net/p/home/
[22:35] <r4y> Look
[22:35] <r4y> LOL, who knows
[22:38] <r4y> I think I will go with 12.10 I guess but I am unsure about this
[22:39] <r4y> TY, and I will be trying the other versions you suggested to atleast see ifI might like
[22:39] <r4y> I also want to try Debian
[22:39] <r4y> And mint and Mandrivia
[22:40] <r4y> TY for the torrent link
[22:41] <r4y> Bye
[22:42] <r4y> Ah, the file is going to be 810.9 MiB, aren't CDs only 700 MiBs?
[22:43] <Unit193> Yes.
[22:43] <r4y> Well, I have 3 options maybe. Virtually, or ysb, or DVD
[22:43] <Unit193> You can try a USB boot.
[22:43] <r4y> usb not ysb sorry
[22:45] <r4y> I don't know if I have any dvds so if I like it maybe, but until after I try other distros so I don't waiste disks
[22:45] <r4y> I meant discs
[22:45] <r4y> or maybe that was right
[22:45] <r4y> Well, ayways TY again
[22:50] <r4y> Darkxst from the #ubuntu-gnome channel said that was a different project
[23:14] <r4y> He also said to wait for gnome-shell 3.8 release
[23:15] <r4y> Because that is what I want he thinks perhaps.
[23:16] <r4y> I won't know until then, so until then I will try out different distros including the torrent you helped me get with the link you posted to try out and the other releases you suggested trying
[23:16] <r4y> I need to go TY for the help again
