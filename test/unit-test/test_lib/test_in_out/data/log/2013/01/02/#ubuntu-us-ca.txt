[00:51] <Gareth> philipballew: any time really.
[00:54] <bkerensa> geofft and grantbow even if the UI did address it the toggle actually does not work... When you switch it off it still sends searches it just doesnt present results... someone from the community brought this up and I guess there is a bug somewhere that might get addressed at some point
[01:19] <grantbow> bkerensa - wow, thanks for the tip. The 13.04 alpha I just rsynced and tried also had no legal disclaimer at all.
[01:31] <philipballew> Gareth, alright, I can find you tomorrow I guess?
[01:33] <geofft> bkerensa: Interesting
[01:34] <geofft> bkerensa: The bug report claimed that the _wording_ implied that, but I didn't realize that was actually true.

[18:21] <akk> Google put so much effort into power management for the android kernel, and ubuntu historically hasn't been very interested in optimizing PM.
[18:21] <akk> They're going to need a serious change of priorities to be viable on a phone.
[18:21] <akk> If they do, I hope the interest extends to PM on x86 laptops too.

[19:35] <grantbow> So they announced that people can start building products? They did that at several UDSes too, right? Negotiation tactic I guess.
[19:36] <akk> The page looks like it's aimed at manufacturers to get them to consider building a phone.
