[00:11] <pleia2> philipballew: re: scale, did you get the packet yet?
[00:11] <pleia2> if not I might end the email now and just say you're waiting on it, as I know folks have already started making travel plans
[00:11] <pleia2> so knowing that it's "pending" is better than nothing :)
[00:14] <philipballew> pleia2, not yet.
[00:14] <philipballew> good point.
[00:14] <philipballew> ill send it now
[00:14]  * philipballew needs something to do
[00:15] <pleia2> :)
[00:16] <philipballew> Can I copy your email from last year and use it as a template pleia2 ?
[00:16] <pleia2> philipballew: go for it
[00:17]  * philipballew goes for it
[00:23] <philipballew> pleia2, being that we were unable to meetup over holiday, I guess you can send down the stuff, or just give it to someone driving down.
[00:23] <pleia2> philipballew: heh, yeah, I might actually be coming afterall
[00:23] <pleia2> so I'll let you know :)
[00:24] <philipballew> well its only a Weekend trip, so not that hard.
[00:24] <philipballew> are you coming for work?>
[00:25] <pleia2> employer will pay for the trip if I'm speaking, and will probably do an Ubucon talk
[00:25] <pleia2> so for work-ish
[00:25] <grantbow> nice
[00:25] <philipballew> oh nice! I'm gonna do one to!
[00:25] <pleia2> cool
[00:25] <philipballew> oh, also. I noticed last year we had some trouble as I was the only person with a unity laptop so it was contacted System76 to see if they could help us out with one in my place.
[00:26] <pleia2> any luck?
[00:26] <philipballew> yes, there gonna give up one!
[00:27] <pleia2> awesome :)
[00:27] <philipballew> Called someone named ema and she was saying how she is gonna be there, and can bring one for us to use.
[00:27] <pleia2> Emma is great!
[00:28] <philipballew> I told her she can hang out with our LoCo and she said thats good because she had nothing to do in the evenings.
[00:28] <pleia2> :D
[00:29] <philipballew> Scale gets better every year it seems.
[00:40] <philipballew> just sent some email to you peeps.
[00:42] <philipballew> hope it looks good.
[00:42] <pleia2> great :)
[00:42] <philipballew> tight!
