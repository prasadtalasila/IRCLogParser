[17:01] <tom22r> hello
[17:01] <tom22r> in windows 8 with the metro gui I can write apps with javascript, is this possible with a linux gui (unity, gnome etc.) ?
[17:56] <stqn> hi… I searched for days a forum or irc channel related to app devel for ubuntu… finally found this by looking at freenode’s channels list… and just noticed IRC and forum are on developer.ubuntu.com/community in « Other ways to get involved »… :(
