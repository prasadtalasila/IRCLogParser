[08:58] <thorwil> godbyk: for spansih: "El equipo del manual de Ubuntu" vs "El proyecto del manual de Ubuntu"?
[08:59] <thorwil> godbyk: i'D default to "El equipo del manual de Ubuntu" in both cases
[09:21] <thorwil> spansih cover pushed
[09:27] <thorwil> oh, the ump logo as shown on the top of our launchpad pages is wrong (see 2 long green strokes)
[09:37] <thorwil> godbyk: quantal french A4 svg and pdf pushed
[09:52] <thorwil> godbyk: negative kerning after the . in 12.10 pushed
[16:20] <godbyk> Hey, thorwil. Thanks for all the title pages and covers adjustments.
[16:21] <godbyk> thorwil: I just pushed a change for the Spanish cover. The text near the icon on the back side should refer to the Ubuntu Manual Project instead of the Ubuntu Manual Team.
[16:21] <godbyk> (Can I possibly make things more confusing for you? ;-))
[16:25] <thorwil> godbyk: i wasn't realy aware that we the team vs project on front and back
[16:26] <thorwil> isn't that wrong now for nl and fr?
[16:26] <thorwil> we have, even
[16:27] <godbyk> Looks to be. (You can tell how attentive to detail I am, eh?)
[16:27] <godbyk> Not a big deal in any case.
[16:28] <godbyk> I think we I asked the other translators to translate the back cover text, I only gave them the two paragraphs.
[16:29] <thorwil> it is the same string for 12-04 e2 in fr and nl
[16:31] <thorwil> godbyk: would be nice to be consistent, but it's up to you (again). luckily that text can be replaced without issues
[16:32] <godbyk> thorwil: Consistent across translations/languages or consistent using the same string on both the front and back cover?
[16:32] <thorwil> godbyk: consistent across languages
[16:33] <thorwil> but it is a good question why we have this team/project thing in the first place
[16:34] <godbyk> It is.
[16:35] <thorwil> i have no clue and no strong inclination either way. how odd of me
[16:44] <thorwil> the reasoning for referring to team is likely that it might seem a more natural way to refer to a group of authors. reserving project for one level up
[16:46] <godbyk> thorwil: I think so, too.  The team was the author, but the icon is the project's logo.
[16:47] <thorwil> then lets continue with that scheme
[16:48] <thorwil> http://ubuntu-manual.org/ proudly claims "translated into more than 52 languages" ...
[16:48] <CarstenG> Hi at all
[16:49] <thorwil> hi CarstenG
[16:51] <CarstenG> Hi Thorsten
[16:52] <CarstenG> 52 languages? :-) Thats maybe the number of _started_ translations. :-)
[16:53] <godbyk> Yeah, I think Ben got a bit ahead of himself with a lot of the text on that website. :-)
[16:53] <thorwil> yeah, sounds like something Ben wrote while riding a unicorn, playing trumpet
[16:53] <godbyk> thorwil: That sums it up pretty neatly, I think. :)
[17:20] <thorwil> godbyk: pushed slovenian. needs to have a translator check the hyphenation of the backmatter
[17:21] <thorwil> + translation of "project" instead of "team"
[17:58] <cqfd93> Hi All!
[17:58] <cqfd93> The French version of precise-e2 is already available on amazon-fr :-) :-) :-)
[18:25] <thorwil> cool
[18:28] <cqfd93> Yes!
[18:52] <godbyk> thorwil: Thanks. I'll pass it along to the Slovenian translation editor for proofreading.
