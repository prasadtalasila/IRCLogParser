[06:36] <inetpro> guten morgen
[06:37] <Kilos> hiya inetpro 
[06:37] <inetpro> Kilos: those few drops don't count for anything
[06:37] <Kilos> we got nothing
[06:38] <inetpro> somebody stole them away
[06:38] <Kilos> ai!
[06:38] <inetpro> Kilos: at least it is much cooler this morning
[06:38] <Kilos> yip luckily
[06:39] <Kilos> was a stinker yesterday and last night
[06:41] <inetpro> hope that we'll see some big rains today
[06:41] <Kilos> maybe we should revive the rain dance
[06:42] <inetpro> lol
[06:42] <inetpro> nee man!
[06:42] <inetpro> just pray to the big man
[06:43] <Kilos> i dont think he is very happy with mankind at the moment
[06:43] <inetpro> he'll sort things out 
[06:43] <Kilos> yo Vince-0 
[06:47] <Vince-0> Hi Kilos 
[06:54] <superfly> good evening
[06:55]  * Kilos waves to the fly
=== Trixar_za is now known as Trix[a]r_za
[07:16] <Kilos> hi henkj hubx 
[07:16] <inetpro> superfly: uh, it's morning, really
[07:16] <hubx> hi there
[07:17] <Kilos> inetpro, http://imageshack.us/content_round.php?page=done&l=img594/6826/marog.jpg
[07:17] <inetpro> hubx: wb
[07:17] <inetpro> Kilos: sjoe
[07:17] <inetpro> lyk soos ware onkruid
[07:18] <Kilos> jy gooi dit seker al jare weg
[07:18] <inetpro> sal moet gaan loer
[07:18] <Kilos> daai goed lekkerder as spinasie  en meer voedings waarde
[07:18] <inetpro> wat is daai Kilos?
[07:19] <inetpro> is dit mfino of die ander goed?
[07:19] <Kilos> dis die marog wat die ou boere misbredia genoem het want dit het al om krale op gekom
[07:20] <Kilos> die swartes hier noem dit mfino 
[07:20] <inetpro> ok
[07:20] <superfly> thanks magespawn that's what I was thinking. I really don't see the need to pump my body full of chemicals
[07:20] <inetpro> sal bietjie moet kyk 
[07:21] <superfly> magespawn: and less so for the kids
[07:22] <inetpro> Kilos: wat pluk jy, groot of klein blare? of albei?
[07:22] <Kilos> al blare wat nog mooi is , wat goggas nie by gekom het nie
[07:22] <Kilos> alle
[07:22] <inetpro> superfly: get a mosquito net for the kiddies
[07:23] <inetpro> or two
[07:23] <Kilos> eek squito probs in a flat?
[07:23] <Kilos> sjoe
[07:23] <superfly> inetpro: yeah, and tabbard 
[07:23] <superfly> Kilos: no, in kzn
[07:24] <Kilos> oh lol
[07:24] <superfly> Kilos: I'm going up to visit magespawn in june
[07:24] <Kilos> yeah thats great i been watching the planning superfly 
[07:25] <superfly> well, we're going to my sister's wedding, and magespawn gets to benefit
[07:25] <Kilos> squitos come out as the sun goes down there so if you close up before then you ok
[07:25] <Kilos> and can burn mosquito coils as well
[07:25] <Kilos> or those plugin thingies
[07:26] <Kilos> and nuvolari  too lucky fellas
[07:26] <superfly> ja 
[07:30] <inetpro> Kilos: too or two?
[07:30] <Kilos> too also as well
[07:30] <Kilos> sorry
[07:30] <inetpro> lol
[08:21] <nlsthzn> morning all 
[08:26] <Squirm> [08:02:10] .:Squirm:. has a sulfur stench
[08:26] <Squirm> [08:06:02] .:Kilos:. wow from what?
[08:26] <Squirm> Kilos: don't really know
[08:27] <Squirm> my boss thinks it's water stuck in the conduit
[08:30] <Kilos> not nice squirm but you get used to it after a while , like going to hotwater sulphur springs
[08:39] <Squirm> it's not nice at all
[09:26] <superfly> I suck at those sorts of games, but that's a pretty good idea
[09:26] <superfly> and having teams does make it better
[09:32] <henkj> I wouldn't mind playing some games if I wasn't working
[11:07] <magespawn> superfly fans also work nicely at night to keep the mozzies away, kids under a certain age cannot have tablets, anyway it will be the middle of winter.
[11:07] <superfly> ya, saw all of that and figured we'd be fine with just precaution
[11:08] <magespawn> i am up at Hilltop camp in the reserve at the moment
[11:08] <magespawn> On a game drive
[11:08] <charl_> good evening
[11:10] <inetpro> magespawn: nice 
[11:11] <magespawn> Two days of contrast yesterday 45 in the shade, today 25 cold and rain. 
[11:14] <inetpro> at least things have cooled down in Pretoria as well
[11:15] <inetpro> superfly: you still enjoying that new phone of yours? 
[11:15] <superfly> inetpro: yes
[11:16] <inetpro> so how's it comparing with that Nokia now? 
[11:20] <superfly> I still love the Nokia's physical keyboard and pure linux platform
[11:20] <magespawn> Nokia ftw
[11:21] <superfly> but the Android ecosystem is awesome
[11:21] <superfly> I wish I could have a Nokia ecosystem like the Android one
[11:22] <magespawn> The n900 hardware capabilities/flexiblity are cool
[11:25] <magespawn> Gotta go guys see you later.
[11:40] <inetpro> superfly: I think we'll get there 
[11:40] <inetpro> one day
[11:42] <superfly> inetpro: I hope so, I'm looking forward to seeing how SailFish does.
[11:47] <superfly> see? you CAN bottom post from your Android phone.
[11:48] <superfly> buncha nerfs 
[11:53] <inetpro> lol
[11:57] <Kilos> some peeps cant even bottom post from a buntu pc
[11:58] <Kilos> painful reading mails nowadays posts top and bottom
[12:10] <inetpro> superfly: all we need is for hardware manufacturers to agree in doing things the real open source way
[12:10] <superfly> inetpro: fat chance
[12:10] <inetpro> the direction that sun microsystems was going
[12:11] <inetpro> yeah, it's a tough one
[12:12] <inetpro> how else will we get there?
[12:17] <inetpro> Kilos: wb
[12:17] <inetpro> waar was jy?
[12:17] <Kilos> ek watch julle nog die hele tyd
[12:18] <inetpro> hmm...
[12:18] <inetpro> ek wonder
[12:18] <Kilos> lol
[12:19] <Kilos> en peer het my vir 2 minute gedooi
[12:19] <Kilos> 14.16
[12:26] <inetpro> superfly: I must be honest, I see a lot of negativity about Ubuntu/Canonical but I am still very positive about it
[12:27] <inetpro> we've come a very long way even if we still have many challenges ahead
[12:27] <inetpro> and the ecosystem just keeps growing
[12:27] <inetpro> and it's still very good for Linux as a whole
[12:37] <charl_> superfly: didn't nokia dump linux in favour of windows?
[12:37] <nlsthzn> o/ all I need some advice from the boffins regarding dual screens
[12:37]  * nlsthzn read yesterday nokia is open to android possibilities 
[12:38] <charl_> inetpro: that's true but most of the negativity seems to be related to unity though
[12:38] <charl_> nlsthzn: that's interesting... i think they are feeling dumped by microsoft considering they are competing with hardware manufacturers now
[12:40] <nlsthzn> both companies are in a tight spot but any one of them will jump at the possibility to stay relevant :p
[12:41] <charl_> interesting enough, it almost looks like nokia disappeared from the market
[12:41] <charl_> i see or hear almost nothing of them these days
[12:41] <inetpro> what we need is for more open source guys to stand together, take a stand and not allow one single company to dominate and take the biggest slice of the cake
[12:41]  * nlsthzn has dual monitors, one conntected to Radeon gfx card and one connected to Intel on-board... Radeon working fine and Intel now showing anything (except at boot time it shows the Ubuntu plymouth screen)
[12:42] <inetpro> there is space for everyone
[12:42] <charl_> what took me by surprise is that even blackberry is still quite active and their new devices look all the more like android/iphone
[12:42] <charl_> nokia lost out bigtime
[12:43] <charl_> nlsthzn: good work, which drivers are you using for the radeon?
[12:44] <charl_> inetpro: that's easier said than done, although personally i'm quite happy if a few large companies keep competing against each other as well
[12:44] <charl_> as long as there's enough competition in the market we can't have microsoft trying to take over the world with their browser again
[12:44] <nlsthzn> some more info that might be useful - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2087963
[12:45] <nlsthzn> I am using the radeon drivers from AMD
[12:45] <nlsthzn> but the intel card doesn't show if I xrandr etc
[12:47] <charl_> is the intel an on-board one?
[12:48] <nlsthzn> yup
[12:48] <nlsthzn> works very well in Windows from the get go :/
[12:48] <charl_> i have an intel hd in my lenovo and it's working great on ubuntu
[12:49] <charl_> intel graphics chipsets are so simple they work on almost anything :)
[12:49] <nlsthzn> charl_, sure, but I am trying to get both the Intel and Radeon to work at the same time each powering a different monitor
[12:50] <nlsthzn> If I go to a tty the intel takes over and the radeon goes blamnk
[12:50] <nlsthzn> seems it is either the one or the other at the moment
[12:50] <charl_> ah, so when you're in X you have a picture on the radeon and not on the intel
[12:50] <nlsthzn> yup
[12:51] <charl_> and if you go to tty you have it the other way round?
[12:51] <charl_> very interesting
[12:51] <charl_> i can understand the behaviour if you go to tty but it just means X isn't configured correctly right?
[12:51]  * nlsthzn has no idea
[12:51] <charl_> and xrandr gives you only one monitor? or both?
[12:52] <nlsthzn> only one
[12:52] <charl_> very interesting
[12:52] <nlsthzn> and won't run on the second in tty cause no x running their :p;
[12:52]  * nlsthzn going to try #u-beginners
[12:52] <nlsthzn> brb
[12:52] <charl_> not exactly a beginner question imho :)
[12:53] <nlsthzn> still better than going to #ubuntu
[12:56] <charl_> this looks interesting: https://www.tizen.org/about
[12:58]  * nlsthzn is rather hoping Ubuntu Phone OS gets a ROM for the S3... but tizen might be cool too :p
[12:58] <charl_> android not cutting it for you?
[12:59] <nlsthzn> sure, I love android, but I also like Unity and Ubuntu :p
[13:00] <charl_> i like the idea of ubuntu phone but i'm just wondering what the main selling points will be
[13:01] <inetpro> charl_: a phone that can be docked to become the desktop on a big screen will be amazing
[13:01] <nlsthzn> well in theory with a quad core phone and enough ram you have  a desktop in your pocket 
[13:01] <nlsthzn> just need the dock like you said
[13:02] <inetpro> endless possibilities
[13:02] <charl_> it will be hard competing with the number of android apps in google play, and android apps are usually designed specifically with the touch screen in mind
[13:02] <inetpro> all we need is good hardware
[13:02] <nlsthzn> http://youtu.be/Gu98c6EzEhI
[13:02] <charl_> the docking feature is indeed very cool, but i was referring to the latest "proper" ubuntu on a phone
[13:03] <nlsthzn> charl_, same
[13:04] <nlsthzn> ubuntu on android is android on the phone, ubuntu when docked, ubuntu phone os is ubuntu on the phone and ubuntu when docked
[13:04] <charl_> yeah exactly, the latter then
[13:05] <Kilos> hmm i keep disconnecting it seems
[13:05] <Kilos> thats something new
[13:05] <nlsthzn> hiya uncle Kilos 
[13:05] <Kilos> hi there nlsthzn 
[13:06] <nlsthzn> spam all the channels :/
[13:06] <Kilos> hahaha
[13:07] <Kilos> they already threatening to ban me
[13:07] <charl_> it seems like canonical is pushing really hard for the device convergance, same as microsoft
[13:07] <charl_> one application that can run across all devices with both touch-screen interfaces and physical mouse/touchpad/keyboard etc
[13:08] <nlsthzn> charl_, they state so catagorically
[13:08] <nlsthzn> *speeling
[13:08] <nlsthzn> Unity isn't just a clever name
[13:14] <nlsthzn> great seems #ubuntu has turned into a spammer channel with only hello's and such 
[13:24] <nlsthzn> silly question - where is typical places for xorg.conf to hide (I know one is /etc/X11) any others?
[13:28] <nlsthzn> brb
[13:33] <Squirm> XDSL released 100Mbit connection
[13:33] <Squirm> in SA
[13:33] <Squirm> 100Mbps – R64,370 per month
[13:33] <Squirm> google, in the US, has it for free
[13:34] <Squirm> for 1000Mbps, google charges like $40
[13:34]  * Squirm kicks South Africa
[13:40] <inetpro> Squirm: ai!
[13:57] <Squirm> inetpro: it's bad :/
[13:57] <Squirm> well, actually, it's just plain wrong
[14:01]  * inetpro agrees
[14:12] <inetpro> Squirm: that is our biggest hurdle at the moment
[14:25] <Kilos> ok all go home now
[14:26] <superfly> bye! 
[14:26] <Kilos> toods superfly 
[14:26] <Kilos> go safe
[15:12] <charl_> ciao all
[15:44] <inetpro> thank you kilos
[15:44] <Kilos> for what now inetpro ?
[15:44] <inetpro> Kilos: you said I can go home
[15:44] <Kilos> long ago man
[15:45] <Kilos> 16.26
[15:45] <Kilos> you been sleeping
[15:45] <inetpro> oh but I didn't see it then
[15:45] <Kilos> ??
[15:45] <inetpro> ai!
[15:45] <Kilos> hahaha
[15:45] <inetpro> Kilos: but /me has been at home long before that
[15:46] <Kilos> sjoe sklem
[15:46] <Kilos> skelm
[15:46] <inetpro> lol
[15:46] <Kilos> het jy gelees wat het ek gese
[15:46]  * inetpro had to fetch the highschool kids at school today
[15:46] <Kilos> ah
[15:47] <inetpro> Kilos: jep, and all done
[15:47] <inetpro> and dusted
[15:47] <Kilos> good man that was quick
[15:47] <Kilos> them too?
[15:47] <inetpro> all in a days work
[15:47] <Kilos> youll only get that prob where the ground doesnt rain wet
[15:48] <Kilos> them and flees love dry soil
[15:48] <inetpro> Kilos: we'll sort them all out
[15:48] <Kilos> good man
[15:48] <inetpro> thanks for the tips
[15:49] <inetpro> helps to have a farmer on the channel
[15:49] <Kilos> anytime sir
[15:49] <Kilos> my limited knowledge is yours
[15:49] <inetpro> haha
[15:52] <Kilos> yo tumbleweed 
[15:52] <Kilos> all good?
[15:57] <tumbleweed> yup, pretty good. you?
[15:57] <Kilos> weather liars say we had 60% chance of heavy rain today and tonight
[15:57] <Kilos> we had nothing
[15:57] <Kilos> good ty tumbleweed 
[15:57] <tumbleweed> well, it was only a 60% chance :)
[15:57] <Kilos> haha
[15:58] <Kilos> lemme know when you python guys have time to work on the greeter please
[15:58] <Kilos> it does funny things
[15:59] <tumbleweed> such as?
[15:59] <Kilos> if i close it by ctrl+c in the terminal and restart it greets everyone individually
[15:59] <Kilos> haha
[15:59] <Kilos> major spam
[16:00] <Kilos> otherwise it just greets new peeps when channel quiet
[16:00] <tumbleweed> right, so it should ignore everyone who's in the channel when it joins
[16:00] <Kilos> when it joins normally it does ignore them
[16:01] <Kilos> only with the ctrl+c kill
[16:01] <Kilos> if i tell it die it doesnt
[16:02] <tumbleweed> that's suprising
[16:02] <Kilos> yeah shes a cheeky thing
[16:03] <Kilos> you can visit on ##kilos
[16:12] <Kilos> hi Tonberry 
[16:12] <Tonberry> hi
[16:47] <Kilos> inetpro, hier kom die wind
[16:51]  * Kilos tuned juank a bit in the mail
[16:51] <inetpro> Kilos: ja ek voel hom hy kom
[16:52] <Kilos> hehe hopelik saam met water
[16:56] <Kilos> i go eat
[17:14] <Kilos> hi smile 
[17:14] <smile> hi :p
[17:30] <Kilos> nuvolari, spoel jy weg?
[18:30]  * Kilos peeks in at the morgue
[18:32] <Kilos> hmmm,, smelly bunch of corpses
[18:40] <superfly> tumbleweed: ping
[18:40] <tumbleweed> superfly: hi
[18:41] <superfly> tumbleweed: I'm getting 404 errors when I apt-get update on my Debian sid VM
[18:41] <superfly> lemme pastebin my output
[18:42] <tumbleweed> sounds like a broken mirror
[18:43] <superfly> tumbleweed: I'm using ftp.debian.org and security.debian.org
[18:43] <superfly> Err http://security.debian.org sid/updates/main Sources
[18:43] <superfly>   404  Not Found [IP: 212.211.132.32 80]
[18:44] <tumbleweed> sources.list?
[18:44] <superfly> I've messed around with it a bit, tried to get it back to normal. hold on while I get it
[18:46] <superfly> http://pastebin.com/fTf0S8Rz
[18:47] <tumbleweed> superfly: security.debian.org doesn't have a /debian/
[18:47] <superfly> ah
[18:50] <superfly> tumbleweed: still getting a 404: Err http://security.debian.org unstable/updates/main Sources
[18:51] <tumbleweed> oh, and of course, unstable isn't doesn't have security support
[18:51] <tumbleweed> duh
[18:51] <superfly> ah
[18:51] <tumbleweed> unstable's security updates come in the form of new uploads to unstable
[18:52] <tumbleweed> testing gets security updates, but only very rarely
[18:52]  * superfly was trying to get the most recent version of Firefox, er IceWeasel, as opposed to version 10
[18:52] <tumbleweed> most come through unstable
[18:52] <tumbleweed> superfly: you probably want mozilla.debian.net
[18:52] <superfly> tumbleweed: right
[18:55]  * superfly sees the light
[18:55] <superfly> tumbleweed: I've decided to move to Debian
[18:56] <superfly> not sure exactly when, got data to backup and move and stuff
[18:57] <superfly> but the KDE that comes with Debian is just smoother than what comes with Kubuntu
[18:58] <tumbleweed> heh
[18:58] <tumbleweed> don't tell the kubuntu people that :P
[18:59] <superfly> I'm over them. I tried to get help from them once and everyone was pointing at everyone else.
[18:59] <tumbleweed> I find Kubuntu one of the most functional areas of Ubuntu. They manage suprisingly well with a tiny team
[18:59] <tumbleweed> but it probably helps that there's a coherent upstream and no commercial conflicts
[19:05] <magespawn> evening all
[19:05] <Kilos> hi magespawn 
[19:05] <Kilos> wb
[19:05] <Kilos> we still had no rain
[19:06] <magespawn> We had rain today and major drop in temp
[19:06] <Kilos> temps dropped lekker but no water
[19:06] <Kilos> sigh
[19:12]  * Squirm looks at inetpro 
[19:12] <Squirm> seems I have you on twitter
[19:12] <inetpro> Squirm: why?
[19:13] <Squirm> I just saw an email saying you retweeted something from Command Line Magic
[19:13] <Squirm> :P
[19:14] <Squirm> because I don't use twitter, twitter seems to send me random messages to remind me I have an account :P
[19:14] <inetpro> Squirm: hmm... ok
[19:14] <inetpro> must be one of those rather interesting retweets
[19:15] <Squirm> lsof / | awk '/ DEL /{proc[$1]=1;} END{for (name in proc){print name;}}' # names of processes that keep deleted files open.
[19:15] <inetpro> ahh, I liked that
[19:15] <inetpro> lsof is one very underestimated powerful command
[19:16] <inetpro> with so many different things you can use it for
[19:17] <inetpro> and combined with awk the above is just lovely
[19:17] <inetpro> geek heaven
[19:19] <inetpro> I particularly love that last for loop in awk
[19:19] <inetpro> have never used it before this to be honest
[19:21]  * magespawn goes to read up on lsof and awk
[19:22] <superfly> inetpro is showing his sysadmin side
[19:23] <inetpro> superfly: eh :-P
[19:24] <inetpro> superfly: it's nice, isn't it?
[19:24] <superfly> inetpro: I'm not a sysadmin, never needed to use it
[19:25] <inetpro> hmm...
[19:25] <inetpro> just copy and paste that on your desktop
[19:25] <inetpro> even there it returns interesting info
[19:26] <inetpro> then do the following and see how awk transformed it for you
[19:26] <inetpro> lsof / | grep DEL
[19:27] <inetpro> then go and do it on a busy server and you will appreciate the coolness
[19:28] <inetpro> copy and paste in your cli*
[19:41] <inetpro> oh and here's another magic one from climagic that just landed on twitter
[19:41] <inetpro> ls -rtl | tail -n 1 
[19:43] <inetpro> well not so magic but useful
[19:43] <inetpro> tail -n 1 can be shortened to just tail -1
[19:47] <inetpro> oh and if you need to watch a folder with a number of frequently changing files just do this:
[19:47] <inetpro> watch 'ls -lt --full-time | head'
[20:10] <inetpro> is it Friday evening?
[20:11] <magespawn> Yup
[20:11] <inetpro> ahh, no wonder it's so quiet here
[20:11] <inetpro> magespawn: BTW, did you see anything today?
[20:12] <magespawn> Big five except leopard
[20:12] <inetpro> wow
[20:12] <magespawn> yup pretty cool despite the weather
[20:13] <inetpro> it cold there?
[20:13] <magespawn> For us yes
[20:14] <inetpro> interesting how we have these extreme fluctuations this year
[20:14] <inetpro> this season*
[20:14] <inetpro> I guess even the animals are confused
[20:18] <magespawn> They tend to react as it happens
[20:22] <magespawn> Most of the big ones prefer colder weather
[20:23] <inetpro> now that is interesting
[20:24] <magespawn> Means they can stay more active without overheating
[20:26] <inetpro> makes sense
[20:32] <superfly> magespawn: where do you do these game drives?
[20:33] <inetpro> superfly: I'm guessing the hluhluwe game reserve?
[20:34]  * inetpro was there many years ago
[20:34] <inetpro> very nice area
[20:34] <magespawn> Most of the time but occasionaly some of the others
[20:34] <inetpro> oh of course, there are many private farms as well
[20:36] <magespawn> And Mkuze, St Lucia/isiMangaliso
[20:36] <inetpro> nice
[20:37] <inetpro> sjoe magespawn, you go as far as the St Lucia park as well?
[20:38] <magespawn> Sometimes, only about 100 km though
[20:39] <magespawn> i have a warped sense of far when it comes to driving
[20:40] <inetpro> lol
[20:41] <inetpro> magespawn: you have a tracking app on your mobile phone?
[20:41] <inetpro> or other device even?
[20:41] <magespawn> Somewhere never used it though
[20:42] <inetpro> some very useful apps that are available for android these days
[20:43] <inetpro> could be interesting if you used it on a regular basis to see where you have gone and where not
[20:43] <inetpro> and then marking the areas where you have spotted the different animals
[20:44] <magespawn> Yeah would be, how many times i have been down the same roads
[20:45] <magespawn> I do that that at the current company i have done about 150 000 km of game drive
[20:45] <inetpro> wow
[20:47] <magespawn> Work out how far you drive per day, then work it over 10 years, give yourself a shock
[20:50] <inetpro> anyways
[20:51]  * inetpro calls it a night
[20:51] <inetpro> good night everyone
[21:05] <magespawn> Good night
[21:05] <magespawn> I am also off, night y'all
