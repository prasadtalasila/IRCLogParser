[01:23] <mhall119> tgm4883: https://code.launchpad.net/~mhall119/mythbuntu/mythtvservices-packaging it's not working quite right yet, so don't merge it into yours, I'm getting assitance in #debian-python on OFTC
[01:29] <tgm4883> mhall119, thanks
[01:59] <mhall119> tgm4883: you can merge in rev 5 of my branch, and run "debuild -uc -us -I.bzr" or "bzr builddeb"
[02:05] <tgm4883> mhall119, building now
[02:05] <tgm4883> \o/
[02:05] <tgm4883> mhall119, thank you!
[02:08] <mhall119> glad I could help
[02:08] <mhall119> thank paultag too if you see him
[02:09] <mhall119> tgm4883: if you want, I can help you make it debian-acceptable next week
[02:10] <tgm4883> mhall119, I suppose we could do that
[02:13] <tgm4883> mhall119, does that naming need to stay like that? python3-mythtvservices?
[02:27] <mhall119> tgm4883: that's the debian/ubuntu standard for python modules
[02:28] <tgm4883> mhall119, ah ok
[02:28] <tgm4883> I'll leave it then

[02:29] <tgm4883> mhall119, I need to have it install one more file (a picture), can I just do that in setup.py or does other stuff need to be done now
[02:29] <mhall119> you should be able to do it in setup.py as a data file
[02:29] <tgm4883> mhall119, ok that is what I was planning
[02:30] <mhall119> the packaging scripts are calling setup.py build and setup.py install, so it should automatically pick it up
