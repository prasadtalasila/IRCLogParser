[14:11] <senator_> hi
[14:13] <smartboyhw> Hi senator_
[14:13] <senator_> hello
[14:13] <senator_> I am hoping for a little help
[14:14] <senator_> I have installed the compiz on studio with the hope of using the annotate feature but I cant just understand the combination
[14:14] <senator_> shift-superkey-1 or so
[14:14] <senator_> i use it and nothing happens
[14:15] <smartboyhw> senator_, aren't compiz supposed to be with Unity better?
[14:15] <senator_> smartboyhw, I dont get what yu mean
[14:16] <len-1304> senator_, you may have to add the shortcut with the settings manager.
[14:17] <len-1304> I don't know the command to do that with. but I see there is no shortcut installed for that.
[14:18] <senator_> here is the thing, I am able to open compiz and select the annotate under Extra... when i do that I then try to use the keys combi but nothing happens
[14:18] <senator_> I just want to write directly on the screen
[14:19] <senator_> Freehand is Alt>Super> Button1, while line is alt> Super> Button2... none works
[14:21] <len-1304> I know so little about compiz that I am not sure what that means., but as soon as you are no longer using a window the shortcuts have to be there in xfce so they are used by the desktop.
[16:04] <holstein> senator_: i used to use compiz
[16:04] <holstein> senator_: it is changing upstream... ubuntustudio doesnt do anything to it to change it
[16:05] <holstein> when i got it working in XFCE, i found i had to really hack at it to get it back to "normal"
[16:05] <holstein> i dont use it anymore
[16:11] <senator_> i see
[16:11] <senator_> great to have yu here holstein
[16:12] <senator_> all I just wanted is to be able to draw or write on screen directly, , like can be done on windows
[16:13] <holstein> senator_: like can be done on windows?
[16:17] <holstein> http://wiki.compiz.org/Plugins/Annotate
[16:17] <holstein> has the shortcut commands
[16:18] <holstein> as len-1304 says, you should just be able to get compiz running in xfce http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/how-to-set-up-compiz-in-xubuntu-1210-or.html ...and add the proper plugin
[16:20] <holstein> senator_: http://code.google.com/p/ardesia/ seems like another option that should work with other comp managers
[19:27] <tete_> so, got ubuntu studio now installed on usb stick and booted from my workstation, but still i cant hear no sound as soon as i enable jack... this is really driving me crazy
[19:27] <tete_> it cant be that hard to get that "!$T& working
[19:45] <FloatingGoat> tete
[19:45] <FloatingGoat> hmm
[19:46] <FloatingGoat> how do you hear no sound?
[19:46] <FloatingGoat> when you play a youtube video?
[19:46] <FloatingGoat> tete_:
[19:46] <tete_> jop, i got it now working that i can playback mp3 in audacious
[19:46] <tete_> with jackd... but i have no idea what to do to get sound of my guitar
[19:46] <FloatingGoat> haha alright ill be right back
[19:46] <FloatingGoat> well
[19:47] <FloatingGoat> you have to connect the system input to itself
[19:47] <FloatingGoat> actually
[19:47] <tete_> it is displayed in the settings that its seeing some kind of signals and i really had it now at 100%
[19:47] <FloatingGoat> it would be better if you opened up rakarak
[19:47] <tete_> system input to itself?
[19:47] <tete_> i have rakarrack opened and its giving some wierd noises ;)
[19:47] <FloatingGoat> okay
[19:47] <FloatingGoat> open up jack
[19:48] <tete_> ok
[19:48] <FloatingGoat> is you guitar connected to the analogue input?
[19:48] <tete_> hm its a rocksmith realtone cable with integrated soundcard... i have no idea
[19:48] <tete_> i am absolutly new to all this stuff
[19:48] <FloatingGoat> okay
[19:48] <FloatingGoat> so
[19:48] <FloatingGoat> is it connected with USB?
[19:48] <tete_> jop
[19:49] <FloatingGoat> okay open the settings on jack
[19:49] <tete_> ok
[19:49] <FloatingGoat> setup I mean
[19:49] <FloatingGoat> go to the little arrow next to input device
[19:49] <tete_> ok
[19:49] <FloatingGoat> it should show your USB device
[19:49] <FloatingGoat> change it to that
[19:50] <tete_> hw:1 and hw1,1 where hw1 shows as rocksmith and hw1,0 as usb audio
[19:50] <FloatingGoat> well
[19:50] <tete_> got it now on hw:1
[19:50] <FloatingGoat> change it to rocksmith
[19:50] <tete_> ok
[19:50] <FloatingGoat> now you might want to restart jack after that
[19:51] <tete_> uh its evil crashed ;)
[19:51] <FloatingGoat> ill be right back as well
[19:51] <FloatingGoat> its best to log in then out when restarting jack
[19:51] <FloatingGoat> its a tricky little bugger
[19:51] <FloatingGoat> but very VERY useful when you get it working
[19:51] <FloatingGoat> Im actually starting it right now
[19:51] <tete_> you mean real logout?
[19:52] <tete_> from the session?
[19:52] <FloatingGoat> I usually do a killall5
[19:52] <zequence> If stopping jack makes it crash (known bug) do this in a terminal before trying to restart: killall -9 jackdbus
[19:52] <FloatingGoat> wow
[19:52] <FloatingGoat> i never knew that
[19:52] <zequence> No need to log out
[19:52] <FloatingGoat> I was going to say
[19:52] <FloatingGoat> I dont know if this is the best solution
[19:52] <FloatingGoat> but its the only one I know hahaha
[19:52] <tete_> ok its back again
[19:52] <FloatingGoat> and then he come in
[19:53] <FloatingGoat> zequence: what if jack just fails to start?
[19:53] <FloatingGoat> tete_: reopen rakarak
[19:53] <zequence> Ubuntu 13.04 will include a fixed jack. If I get the time for it, I'll try get jack updated on previous releases too
[19:53] <tete_> its opened
[19:53] <FloatingGoat> it might not be connected to jack anymore
[19:53] <tete_> i reopened :)
[19:53] <FloatingGoat> but what you should do is
[19:54] <FloatingGoat> go to jack and click connections
[19:54] <tete_> ok
[19:54] <FloatingGoat> or connect
[19:54] <tete_> its in german but i know what you mean :)
[19:54] <FloatingGoat> click rackarack on the left and system on the right
[19:54] <FloatingGoat> then click connect
[19:54] <FloatingGoat> and vice versa
[19:54] <FloatingGoat> click rakarack on the left and system on the right and click connect
[19:55] <zequence> FloatingGoat: Just make sure there's no jackd or jackdbus running. Make sure to kill them. If jack doesn't start after that, kill both jack and  pulseaudio. If it still doesn't work, you've got a bad setting or trying to start at too low latency
[19:55] <tete_> i did it and i can hear some strange sound but when i play on the guitar i can not hear anything
[19:55] <zequence> FloatingGoat: One reason jack might not start is if pulseaudio is actively using the card for something. And even if it isn't, you might have problems. Using pasuspender can fix that
[19:56] <zequence> ..killing pulseaudio just makes it restart, btw.
[19:56] <tete_> now i clicked on "FX on" in rakarrack and now i have this alien sound again ;) i guess its this "rodent airlines" sound
[19:56] <FloatingGoat> how do i use pasuspender
[19:57] <zequence> Example: pasuspender -- qjackctl
[19:57] <FloatingGoat> tete
[19:57] <FloatingGoat> tete_: but you got it working?
[19:57] <tete_> i can hear some sound from rakarrack yes but its not my guitar :)
[19:57] <tete_> when i play on my guitar i can not hear it
[19:57] <zequence> You can also just use pasuspender to temporarily mute pulseaudio and make it ungrab a card with something like: pasuspender -- sleep 10
[19:58] <zequence> tete_: Did you connect your audio device input to rakkarack?
[19:58] <tete_> audacious is working like a charm with jackd so i guess its really only a configuration thing
[19:58] <FloatingGoat> ill be right back
[19:58] <tete_> i have only system/capture_1 and system/capture_2 as input
[19:59] <zequence> One of them is your guitar
[19:59] <tete_> and rakarrack and pulseaudio jack sink but i guess thats not relevant
[19:59] <tete_> yes both are connected to rakarrack
[19:59] <tete_> capture_1 -> in_1 and in_2 and capture_2 to in_1 and in_2
[19:59] <tete_> i could make a screenshot if that helps
[19:59] <zequence> tete_: Connect your audio device input to your audio device output. If you don't hear the guitar, then your levels are muted
[20:01] <tete_> http://www.imagebanana.com/view/ne35yz0e/Bildschirmfoto18.01.2013200101.png
[20:02] <zequence> tete_: That doesn't look like your usb device
[20:02] <zequence> That looks like your internal audio device
[20:03] <tete_> hmm
[20:03] <zequence> Make sure to select the right one, and restart jack
[20:03] <tete_> but i selected the rocksmith one..
[20:03] <zequence> does it have 8 outputs?
[20:03] <tete_> no my internal sound card also does not have 8 outputs :)
[20:04] <zequence> tete_: Your internal audio device is not 7.1?
[20:04] <tete_> no should be 5.1
[20:04] <zequence> tete_: Did you restart jack?
[20:04] <tete_> a few minutes ago, yes
[20:04] <tete_> i restart it again
[20:04] <zequence> tete_: 2 more outputs may be digital
[20:05] <zequence> Anyway, it looks very much like an internal device
[20:05] <tete_> should i leave output device as default?
[20:05] <zequence> tete_: Just set "interface"
[20:05] <zequence> Do not set input and output separately
[20:05] <tete_> ok... so maybe thats the problem
[20:07] <tete_> ohhhh yeah :) thank you so much
[20:08] <tete_> i can see a signal in rakarrack
[20:09] <zequence> have fun
[20:09] <zequence> To set lower latency, make "frames/period" smaller
[20:09] <tete_> hm how evil i can see the signal but still no sound
[20:09] <zequence> 64 is preferred, but it depends a bit on your hardware, whether  you can make it work
[20:10] <zequence> I'm sure you'll work it out :)
[20:10] <tete_> http://www.imagebanana.com/view/eydgzz01/Bildschirmfoto18.01.2013201005.png
[20:10] <tete_> ok i will try it
[20:11] <zequence> tete_: Oh, you don't have outputs
[20:11] <zequence> I didn't realize that
[20:11] <zequence> I guess you have to use input and output separately then
[20:11] <tete_> hmm ok
[20:11] <zequence> If you get choppy audio, ask about it on #jack
[20:12] <zequence> I don't usually use two devices at once like that
[20:12] <zequence> ..meaning, one for input, and the other for output
[20:16] <tete_> hm ... still not working, as soon as i change the interface to 2 seperate in/outputs i can get no signal anymore from the guitar
[20:18] <zequence> tete_: Id' head over to #jack and ask about how to do that. Or #opensourcemusicians
[20:18] <tete_> jop i just joined #jack
[20:18] <tete_> thanks :)
[20:18] <zequence> np
[21:00] <zequence> tete_: If you feel you have the time to spare, Ubuntu Studio could really use your help
[21:02] <zequence> Doesn't involve programming nessecarily
[21:02] <tete_> i could of course spend a few hours
[21:02] <zequence> tete_: Check out #ubuntustudio-devel
[21:02] <zequence> Let me introduce you to what we do a bit, and feel free to hang out with us
[21:03] <tete_> ok
