[17:58] <LIDH> hello
[17:59] <LIDH> anyone to give me a hand on a problem related to touchscreen?
[18:07] <bregma> LIDH, depends on your problem
[18:11] <LIDH> So, I have Ubuntu 12.10 and a POS system EBN X-950 with touchscreen (EgalaxyTouch according to the manual), so, i tried $lsusb and it doesn't list the touchscreen controller. If I do a screen /dev/ttyS[0-4] can't get any input from the touchscreen. Already did $ modprobe -r usbtouchscreen and still doesn't detect, any ideas what's the problem?
