[00:58] <davethefan> is anybody awake in here?
[01:00] <holstein> davethefan: maybe.. you just ask and if any volunteers are available, you will get a respose
[01:01] <davethefan> hi holstein: i'm looking for an application that will search for a string of text inside a list of (ASP) files from a specific folder

[02:28] <ufo2222> How much space does a full install take up on a hard disk?
[02:29] <holstein> ufo2222: i would want 6 or 8 gb
[02:30] <holstein> not sure if you can fit in 4 gb's anymore or not
[02:32] <holstein> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD is a good option.. start minimal and then
[02:32] <holstein> !pure xfce
[02:32] <holstein> !purexfce
[02:32] <ubottu> If you want to remove all !KDE and !Gnome packages and have a default !Xubuntu system follow the instructions here « http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purexfce »
[02:33] <holstein> of course, you'll just be adding what you want to it instead of changing a current xubuntu install
[02:38] <ufo2222> How is the hardware detection?
[02:39] <holstein> ufo2222: with xubuntu? any current hardware made that allows the linux community to support it, and is not restricted by licensing is detected and supported well
[02:42] <ufo2222> Well, i got an old thinkpad, model  a22m 2628 to be specific, and i would like to know if it would fit the hardware
[02:43] <holstein> ufo2222: try it live and see how it works.. its really challenging for me or anyone to say first hand since its quite impossible to predict the exact harware in the unit
[02:43] <ufo2222> Thanks
[02:43] <holstein> ufo2222: not all model a22m 2628's will necessarily have the *exact* same harware or chipsets
[02:44] <holstein> i usually load up a live CD and test the sound and networking.. maybe run lspci in a terminal.. see that it sleeps and wakes if that is important

[10:15] <simpleuser> Hello there. I'm using Xubuntu 12.10, and when i right click on a rar and do "extract here" and nothing happens
[10:15] <simpleuser> Which extractor du you use ?
[10:15] <simpleuser> and which one should I use ? :-(
[10:17] <TheSheep> simpleuser: I think that rar is not installed by default, you need to install it with 'apt-get install rar'
[10:17] <TheSheep> with sudo, of course
[10:17] <simpleuser> "unrar x YYY.rar" seems to be working, but i'm looking for an extractor integrated to thunar
[10:18] <simpleuser> TheSheep, no change with rar installed ;)
[10:18] <simpleuser> Is there a way to see why there's a problem ? In var log maybe ?
[10:18] <TheSheep> well, worked for me, so can't really help
[10:18] <simpleuser> ok no prob TheSheep, thanks anyway
[10:18] <TheSheep> you can try starting the file roller from terminal and looking if it shows any error messages when you try to extract that file
[10:19] <TheSheep> (or just check your .xsessionerrors file)
[10:21] <simpleuser> TheSheep, weird. It seems it works when i open it with fileroller (even with just a double click in thunar) and then extract it. It's just the right click and "extract here" which doesn't work
[10:23] <koegs> simpleuser: did do you an "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" already?
[10:23] <koegs> i think i had a similar problem some time ago and it was fixed with an update
[10:24] <simpleuser> oh ok thanks koegs. I'm trying this.
[10:48] <simpleuser> koegs, great, it worked, thanks :)

[18:20] <zodiak> anyone ever seen a case where the mouse in X doesn't select when you click left and drag ?
[18:21] <zodiak> it only started happening about 50 minutes ago.. and a -15/-9 on kpsmoused does nada to help
[18:21] <TheSheep> what is kpsmoused?
[18:21] <zodiak> kernel mouse driver
[18:22] <TheSheep> what does xev say?
[18:22] <zodiak> well, the daemon for the kernel mouse .. but.. you get the idea
[18:22] <zodiak> well, xev see's the button click and button release
[18:23] <zodiak> *scratches head* weird
[18:23] <TheSheep> so nothing wrong with mouse, I guess, I would check the application
[18:23] <TheSheep> maybe it has some mode or something
[18:23] <zodiak> TheSheep, this is across the whole of X
[18:23] <zodiak> not jst '1 app' sadly
[18:23] <TheSheep> any fancy input methods?
[18:23] <zodiak> not that I am aware of ;)
[18:24] <zodiak> no, no xinput or anything for hiragana/katakana
[18:24] <zodiak> as I said, it literally started happening about 50 mins ago.. I think maybe chrome has gotten the drag+drop "stuck"
[18:25] <zodiak> I don't know how else to explain it.. it's.. yeah. I haven't seen this in years of linux use.. weird.
[18:28] <zodiak> well.. shivver my timbers
[18:28] <zodiak> xinput set-prop 13 "Device Enabled" 0
[18:28] <zodiak> xinput set-prop 13 "Device Enabled" 1
[18:28] <zodiak> cured it

[18:29] <zodiak> that's an interesting one.. it appears to be some sort of intersection with X and apps using DnD

[18:45] <SpaceA> i cant find the +mac version for xubuntu any help?
[18:45] <holstein> SpaceA: what are you looking for?
[18:46] <zodiak> TheSheep, agreed.. that said.. I will miss starting apps remotely on other peoples screens ;)
[18:46] <SpaceA> holstein, the +mac image for xubuntu 12.04
[18:47] <bazhang> SpaceA, the intel mac version?
[18:47] <SpaceA> bazhang, sir yes sir
[18:47]  * holstein is unaware of the term "+mac"
[18:48] <bazhang> not sure if they have that for xubuntu. just the regular amd64 should do
[18:48] <holstein> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04/release/
[18:48] <holstein> "as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors"
[18:49] <SpaceA> you are the man holstein
[18:49] <SpaceA> thanks!
[19:21] <louigi> hey fellas! is there any app at all for xubuntu 12.04 that can do a screencast and record sound from the app?
[19:22] <bazhang> !info kazam
[19:22] <ubottu> kazam (source: kazam): Easy to use application for recording on-screen action. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.0.6-0ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 94 kB, installed size 824 kB
[19:22] <holstein> louigi: i have used gtk-recordmydesktop - Graphical frontend for recordMyDesktop screencast tool
[19:23] <louigi> holstein, problem is - no sound recording, only from mic. Since 9.10 jack support is broken.
[19:23] <holstein> louigi: the mic *is* sound
[19:24] <louigi> holstein, yeah, but I am asking record sound FROM app :)
[19:24] <holstein> louigi: if you just want to add music afterwards, i would just addd music afterwards
[19:24] <louigi> ubottu, will look at kazam
[19:24] <ubottu> louigi: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[19:24] <louigi> holstein, I actually want to screencast a game
[19:24] <holstein> louigi: check out what bazhang has suggested, and maybe try #ubuntu and specify what you are wanting to get audio from
[19:25] <louigi> holstein, bazhang okay guys, thx.
[19:25] <louigi> Enjoying xubuntu so far
[19:25] <bazhang> np
[19:26] <louigi> Are there any resources that show research into how fast xubuntu is compared to usual gnome or unity?
[19:26] <holstein> louigi: its the same hardware.. doesnt realy make the machine any "faster".. might seem more lean
[19:26] <holstein> louigi: you can load them up live and test and see for yourself
[19:27] <theenduser> fwiw, Xubuntu makes mine a lean machine :)
[19:27] <louigi> holstein, righto, I apologize for inaccurate use of terms. I mean - low on RAM and filesystem and that sort of stuff
[19:28] <louigi> Wikipedia says Xubuntu at some point stopped being a low resource distro
[19:28] <bazhang> louigi, phoronix did a survey a bit ago measuring xfce4 vs gnome
[19:28] <bazhang> louigi, for truly lighter, you'd want lubuntu
[19:29] <louigi> bazhang, I am no in need for lighter, but now that I've embraced xubuntu, I wanna know all about it. I really enjoy how it looks.
[19:29] <louigi> I also learned how the panels worked and configured it to my liking
[19:35] <louigi> guys, yet another small question - in my Main Menu settings not all entries seem to be editable.
[19:35] <louigi> For instance, I have Wine installed, but it does not appear there and so I cannot move it up or down
[19:35] <louigi> the menu entry I mean
[19:52] <louigi> bazhang, tried kazam. Eventually I found which sound device to choose to get sound from actual apps and not from mic.
[19:52] <louigi> Thank you very much for advice
[19:52] <bazhang> welcome
