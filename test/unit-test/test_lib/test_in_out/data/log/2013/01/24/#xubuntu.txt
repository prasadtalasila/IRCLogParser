[03:05] <Facetious> hello. I'm currently trying to build ristretto from source, and I keep getting messages that various xfce librariries are not current enough. I've compiled some of the libraries myself, but I was wondering if there was a smarter way to get the most current xfce libraries.
[03:11] <holstein> Facetious: i dont muck around much there.. i find something always breaks or gives me a hard time.. i usually try PPA's
[03:13] <Facetious> cool. thanks.
[03:40] <xubuntu570> Hi, i was wondering if anyone knew if i could change the log in screen so it looks like Ubuntu's stock? i have both Ubuntu 12.04 and Xubuntu 12.04 installed on my laptop.
[03:41] <holstein> xubuntu570: sure... you dont want to know the difference though?
[03:42] <xubuntu570> im guessing, that if i change it to ubuntu stock i would have to choose only one flacor to log into am i right?
[03:42] <xubuntu570> flavor*
[03:43] <holstein> xubuntu570: ?
[03:43] <xubuntu570> if i changed the log in screen to be ubuntu stock, i didnt think it let me choos what linux to log into
[03:43] <holstein> xubuntu570: you'll just have the ubuntu greeter
[03:43] <holstein> xubuntu570: they all let you choose whatever you set them up to let you choose
[03:44] <xubuntu570> is there a dowside to that?
[03:44] <holstein> xubuntu570: i suggest leaving it alone
[03:44] <holstein> xubuntu570: bestcase scenario, you mess around for a bit and dont break your system, while only changing sometihng cosmetically
[03:45] <holstein> http://askubuntu.com/questions/195674/how-to-fix-xubuntu-lightdm-theme-after-installing-unity is relevant
[03:47] <xubuntu570> okay, thank you for the help, i think i will have to think about whether or not it's worth it for a while.

[09:07] <nantou> how do I limit upload and download speeds for the whole system?
[09:13] <moetunes> nantou:  afaik you do that at your router
[09:13] <nantou> how?
[09:14] <moetunes> some routers have a setting for that
[09:14] <moetunes> see if this has a clue - http://www.speedguide.net/articles/linux-tweaking-121
[09:15] <moetunes> it's old but ...

[09:20] <nantou> thx baizon
[09:32] <xubuntu301> hey guys
[09:33] <baizon> hi
[09:34] <xubuntu301> is there anyone who know how to get the same windows 7's windows behavior (or ubuntu's) when i put them on the edge on xubuntu?
[09:35] <xubuntu301> the window gets maximazed but it only occupies the upper half of the screen... is quite annoying lol
[10:21] <MoL0ToV> hi to all! i see that latest xubuntu need more or 4GB to install. I have a asus eeepc with 4GB ssd internal disk. what are the latest version that fit in 4GB? leaving some space also to store some document or mp3..
[10:26] <baizon> MoL0ToV: you can always deinstall stuff
[10:26] <baizon> then you get more spac
[10:26] <baizon> *space
[10:28] <MoL0ToV> but the graphical installer say to me that 4,6GB are needed to complete installation
[10:28] <sonkey4> was just gunnna say that
[10:28] <sonkey4> best you could do is install ubuntu mini.iso
[10:29] <sonkey4> then apt-get xubuntu-desktop
[10:29] <baizon> indeed, sonkey4 is right :)
[10:29] <sonkey4> as ubuntu no longer offer alternate installs
=== azeam_afk is now known as azeam
[10:44] <MoL0ToV> and lubuntu? need minus of 4GB to install?
[10:44] <ztxgpsman> MoL0ToV, I have xubuntu installed on a 4GB stick, I've about 2.5GB free on it.
[10:44] <MoL0ToV> the installer stops and say to me that there are no enough space
[10:45] <baizon> the best sollution is what sonkey4 said
[10:45] <baizon> install the mini and then just add xubuntu-desktop

[11:48] <ChesterX> hello, i can not seem to create a vpn connection. which manager do you recommend?

[14:03] <daswort> Is it right that xfrun4 and xfce-appfinder are both the same, but xfrun starts allways with the `-c` option?
[14:14] <ochosi> daswort: well the two were merged in xfce4.10, before that they were separate programmes
[14:22] <daswort> Thanks.
[14:23] <daswort> BTW: appfinder needs 5 sec to start while thunderbird needs just ~1,2sec. Is is there a mode where it runs but is hiden? Like synapse or gnome do, so i dont have to wait.
[14:26] <ochosi> daswort: yes, after launching it for the first time it should be pretty fast
[14:26] <ochosi> there should be a way of preloading it in the session if i'm not mistaken
[14:27] <daswort> i dont see something like that in its manpage. :(
[14:28] <daswort> Oh, there is already a process in the background. Why does it need so much time? (ಠ_ಠ)

[18:27] <xubuntu570> hello?
[18:27] <Facetious> hello
[18:27] <xubuntu570> how do you access the windows hard drive from xubuntu?
[18:27] <xubuntu570> i need to access system 32 to find password hash
[18:28] <Facetious> You should be able to see all the partitions in the file manager
[18:28] <xubuntu570> it doesn't have config folder in it.
[18:29] <Facetious> configuration folder?
[18:29] <xubuntu570> im booting xubuntu 12.10 i386 from live cd, and need to crack windows 7 password.
[18:29] <xubuntu570> i dunno what to do since i don't know jack shit about linux
[18:30] <holstein> xubuntu570: i would watch the language, and try using a live CD such as the ulitmate boot cd
[18:30] <holstein> xubuntu570: if the drive is encrypted, i woudnt know how to deal with that
[18:30] <holstein> i usually just mount the drive and recover the data..
[18:30] <xubuntu570> dont have the resources to get ultimate boot cd...
[18:31] <xubuntu570> the hard drive is shown, just not system 32
[18:31] <holstein> maybe its corrupt
[18:31] <xubuntu570> no, i can run windows perfectly fine.
[18:31] <xubuntu570> i just need the admin's password
[18:32] <holstein> xubuntu570: i wuld use a live CD designed for that purpose
[18:32] <holstein> would*
[18:32] <xubuntu570> i only have the cd im currently running.
[18:33] <xubuntu570> what would you suggest to find the password hashes with only this live cd?
[18:34] <holstein> xubuntu570: searching, or asking in a windows channel.. i dont know where those are, and i dont know anything about recovering that info that way
[18:35] <holstein> i have used the ubcd to reset windows passwords.. and quickly too
=== GrapeAway is now known as GrapeApe
[18:38] <Bon-chan> guys, can i have some problems if i remove gmusicbrowser using apt --purge?
[18:38] <xubuntu570> should i use ophcrack?
[18:41] <holstein> xubuntu570: i would ask a windows channel to be sure... ask how you are expected to recover that information
[18:41] <holstein> Bon-chan: i would just look and see what is being removed

[20:10] <qasim> hi
[20:12] <qasim> videos do not work properly on my newly installed xubuntu 12.10 OS...help please
[20:18] <Facetious> what do you mean by videos?
[20:19] <qasim> videos of any format .... i cant play them properly..image is blury and the picture hangs
[20:19] <Facetious> are you using gstreamer?
[20:20] <qasim> and its like same even after installing restricted extras
[20:20] <qasim> gstreamer is?
[20:20] <qasim> codec or software to run videos?
[20:21] <Facetious> I think it's the default that comes with xubuntu
[20:21] <Facetious> VLC is what most people use though
[20:21] <qasim> ahan
[20:21] <qasim> i have vlc
[20:22] <qasim> rather i prefer vlc but this problem is with every sort of media player i have
[20:22] <Facetious> maybe a problem with the video drivers then
[20:22] <qasim> moreover
[20:22] <qasim> i cant play any type of video through sm player
[20:23] <qasim> when i try to open any video ...it crashes
[20:24] <Facetious> what sort of video card do you have?
[20:24] <qasim> nvdea ge force 6400
[20:25] <qasim> last time on my previosus xubuntu installation i had installed its driver too
[20:25] <Facetious> do you have compiz?
[20:25] <qasim> the driver worked properly but it dint resolve my problem
[20:26] <qasim> what is compiz ?
[20:26] <Facetious> it's a fancy windows effects thing
[20:26] <qasim> no
[20:26] <Facetious> there's a bug that makes videos not work when desktop effects are on or compiz
[20:27] <qasim> does that compiz thingie comes default with xubunu?
[20:27] <qasim> xubuntu*
[20:27] <Facetious> no
[20:27] <qasim> well i dont have it then
[20:28] <Facetious> maybe desktop effects are on?
[20:29] <qasim> i dont thin so
[20:30] <qasim> think*
[20:30] <qasim> how to chk that
[20:30] <Facetious> I think you need compiz anyways for that
[20:31] <qasim> ahan
[20:31] <Facetious> I really can't help you other than tell you to check xorg.conf for anything and maybe reinstall the codec packages
[20:31] <Facetious> sorry
[20:32] <Zelouille> qasim: maybe try to disable the Compositor (in the window manager settings)
[20:33] <qasim> okay let me find that manager
[20:37] <Zelouille> qasim: « window manager tweaks » sorry. Last tab.
[20:38] <qasim> ok\
[20:46] <qasim> Zelouille,  im soooo very greatful ...it was frigging compositer..thx heaps
[20:53] <Zelouille> qasim: you're welcome. But you should thanks Facetious, i would not have suspected the "fancy windows effects" to be the source of the problem.
[20:54] <qasim> aww nice...thx Facetious ..you both were great help to me
