[14:23] <CrusaderAD> Anyone have any recommendations for a solid, stable pci e graphics card for Ubuntu 12.10 x64?
[18:04] <snap-l> Good morning
[18:04] <rick_h_> party
[18:04] <snap-l> Er, more like Good Afternoon. ;)
[18:57] <derekv> so if rolling your own stuff, would you use pulseaudio?
[18:59] <snap-l> I think Pulse Audio is a good thing (tm_
[19:00] <snap-l> Put another way: it isn't going away any time soon
[19:00] <snap-l> and the more compatible with pulse audio you are, the happier the users will be
[19:00] <snap-l> OSS / ALSA are emulated under pulse anyway.
[19:01] <snap-l> What are you planning on doing
[19:01] <snap-l> ?
[19:10] <Blazeix> if i'm using a heavily gnome-based system i'll use pulse, but for simpler environments i still use alsa
[19:17] <snap-l> http://www.macworld.co.uk/mac/news/?newsid=3418779 rick_h_
[19:21] <derekv> no i have freebsd installed on this box and i realized i can't control volume of one app independantly of another easily
[19:22] <derekv> or maybe i just don't know how to d oit
[19:32] <widox> snap-l: that's hilarious
[19:36] <snap-l> derekv: any reason you're using freebsd over Linux?
[19:37] <snap-l> (not trying to be cheeky or anything; if the reason is "I just want to", that's perfectly valid. ;) )
[19:49] <widox> rick_h_: have you tried this before? https://github.com/wertarbyte/autorandr
[19:58] <derekv> snap-l, I have a soft spot for the OS, wanted to try living with it again for a while
[19:58] <derekv> i'm nomadic
[19:58] <derekv> seeing if it can still work as a desktop os
[19:59] <derekv> fortunatly flash is becoming less of an issue
[19:59] <derekv> and video card support seems to be good still, at least for nvidia
[19:59] <derekv> so if anything its better than in the past
[20:00] <derekv> i think its lost some of its advantage as far as being really reponsive compaired to linux (one of the reasons i made the switch the first time, like 1999ish)
[20:00] <derekv> thats probably all about the scheduler
[20:00] <derekv> they got rid of the original scheduler a few versions back, after some fits and starts, because it was inefficient after about two cores
[20:01] <derekv> whereas the new one can handle numba , asymetric etc
[20:01] <derekv> but its more complex and somewhere it lost the magic ability to have a >10 load average and not be noticable to the UI
[20:02] <derekv> so yea, i don't really have any _strong_ technical arguments
[20:02] <derekv> i have a handful of very weak ones
[20:03] <derekv> its a fairly well organized OS ... the tower vs bazar thing i guess.. it feels very clean.  the way the OS is layed out, kindof like a purer unix "vision"
[20:04] <derekv> apart from the difficulty with running flash, its very compairable with say gentoo
[20:05] <derekv> a little bit less finiky... a few more things come with the OS by default
[20:05] <derekv> but still some finikyness depending on what your running it for
[20:06] <derekv> I think running a desktop OS has the most complicated dependancy scenario possible
[20:06] <derekv> and yea, it doesn't come with pulseaudio configured for you, etc
[20:07] <derekv> i wish i could have time to properly configure everything the way I want it, stay up with updates, and then do most of my work on it
[20:08] <derekv> my current job makes the latter impossible and the former difficult unless i give up more important things
[20:12] <derekv> if I was building some servers (hardware), I wouldn't hesitate to use freebsd ... if it was aws or something i'd probably go with ubuntu, freebsd support isn't very mature there...
[20:13] <derekv> hmm, come to think of it I'm to ignorant to say what the practical differences between ubuntu and debian servers would be
[20:14] <derekv> ive done a couple quick ubuntu servers for random things and they work well
[20:53] <snap-l> Yeah, I like Ubuntu servers. They're quick to set up, and pretty extensible.
[21:22] <derekv> i have a serious problem with being interested in too many things
[21:23] <derekv> and then not picking one place to center myself
[21:23] <derekv> become an expert
[21:25] <snap-l> rick_h_: Were you the one who had the ball chair?
[21:41] <derekv> i think the ball chair is ok for the purposes of changing it up
[21:41] <derekv> you'll want to sit on it for like 15 minutes then you'll be done for a while
[21:41] <derekv> helpful but no silver bullet
[21:51] <derekv> i still wan the sit-stand desk
[22:18] <rick_h_> snap-l: I've got a ball I've used as a chair some
[22:18] <rick_h_> widox: no, not used that
[22:49] <snap-l> rick_h_: Would you be opposed to me borrowing it for a bit?
[22:49] <snap-l> Trying to feel out if using a ball chair is a good idea or not
