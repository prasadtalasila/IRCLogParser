[00:01] <xui34> jrib: it would be really convenient if i could just go to add a printer, it see it, and then i can select it.
[00:03] <jrib> xui34: http://www.cups-pdf.de/ maybe has some useful info
[00:04] <jrib> xui34: so I guess you can just setup cups-pdf on your server; or at least that's how it reads

[00:04] <konam> hi, i have a Dell Inspiron 14z (N411z) and everything is recognized out of the box! except for the fact that the touchpad doesn't seem to be very sensitive, sometimes it doesn't even register several clicks made in a row! (made on the touchpad, not the buttons). also, the touchpad doesn't seem to be very fast even though it is configured to be at its fastest on the settings. this touchpad sucks on windows, but not on this level. on windows it never misses cli
[00:04] <konam> cks
[00:04] <xui34> jrib: that might actually be what i'm looking for basically
[00:04] <jrib> xui34: it's in the repositories too (as cups-pdf)
[00:05] <xui34> jrib: i wasn't thinking of it as a piece of software although if i can setup a simple computer and install that it might do what i want
[00:05] <jrib> xui34: what were you thinking of originally?

[00:07] <jrib> !java | SailorMoon
[00:07] <ubottu> SailorMoon: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.

[00:07] <xui34> jrib: i was thinking there maybe was a complete product (like a storage device that emulated a printer on the network; that fake printer that you printed to over the network would store the pdfs on the device itself)
[00:07] <jrib> xui34: oh I see.  Like a ready-made hardware device
[00:08] <xui34> jrib: yes- exactly
[00:08] <jrib> xui34: I guess you can make one with cups pdf :)
[00:08] <xui34> jrib: it would be extremely handy.

[00:19] <SailorMoon> Fullscreen mode doesnt work. it did on Mint. So. :P lol
[00:19] <genii-around> moncapitane: Is / mounted rw ?
[00:20] <Muphrid> SailorMoon: that could also be a DE problem.
[00:20] <Jordan_U> moncapitane: Why are you using init=/bin/bash rather than actually using single user mode? Why does /etc/shadow have 000 permissions when it should have 640?
[00:21] <moncapitane> I don't know the root password so I didn't know single would work and 640 doesn't work either.
[00:21] <litropy> Hi, all. #httpd is quiet. I've just installed standard apache2 on ubuntu; I've added cgi-bin to www, and I'm just looking to give execcgi access to that folder. Is it just a matter of editing apache2.conf with this (used /n for returns to avoid irc scrolling): <Directory /var/www/cgi-bin> /n Options ExecCGI /n SetHandler cgi-script /n </Directory>
[00:21] <moncapitane> Jordan_U: no matter the permissions, I get the same error
[00:21] <moncapitane> 000 or 640
[00:22] <Jordan_U> moncapitane: There is no root password by default in Ubuntu, and thus no password prompt for single user mode. (And as you know, a prompt for a password for single user mode is already a little silly, given how easily it can be bypassed if you have local access to the machine).
[00:22] <hydrox24> moncapitane: Sorry, I just logged in, can you repeat the error for me and what program it's coming from?
[00:22] <moncapitane> how do I get around an issue when the server is in init=/bin/bash (single user mode) and when I run passwd, it doesn't prompt for the password but gives me the following error: passwd: authentication token manipulation error passwd: password unchanged

[00:23] <Ryan52> Hi, I have a script that uses ANSI color codes but I can't seem to escape them for line length purposes, I tried to use \[ which works for $PS1 gets ignored and \001 which works on Mac OS X just gets printed as well. Anybody have any ideas for alternatives?
[00:23] <moncapitane> yes, on /etc/shadow hydrox24
[00:23] <Jordan_U> moncapitane: It sounds like you have some serious problems with your installation, and I think figuring out what got you to this state will help figure out how to fix things and set whatever password you want to set. (By the way, you should *not* set a root password).
[00:23] <hydrox24> Because the solution seems to be remounting root as read/write....

[00:25] <Jordan_U> moncapitane: Why were the permissions on /etc/shadow ever 000?
[00:25] <moncapitane> because all the forums I was reading said it needs to be 000
[00:25] <hydrox24> check that the date is set correctly in bios and that the timestamp on the shadow file isn't weird
[00:25] <moncapitane> the date if right

[00:27] <moncapitane> |Anthony|: yes, you can use i368 packages on a 64 bit machine

[00:27] <litropy> moncapitane, do you remember the moment when you noticed this issue? Do you remember what you were doing before then?
[00:27] <Jordan_U> moncapitane: Try actually booting into single user mode, rather than bypassing init completely as you're doing with init=/bin/bash, and see if that works. You can get to single user mode by selecting the "recovery mode" entry from the grub menu.
[00:28] <moncapitane> Jordan_U: when I use recovery mode, it still asks for the current password or use ctrl-d to continue when I go to prompt
[00:28] <excervo> hello guys, where can i get chat support with macos?
[00:28] <litropy> excervo, #mac
[00:29] <excervo> litropy, thanks
[00:29] <moncapitane> I just did single in the grub and now it says, give root password for maintenance (or type control-d to continue): and I don't know the password
[00:29] <hydrox24> |Anthony|: if you have any issues installing it (dependencies and the like) just run "sudo apt-get -f install" without any package names or anything to fix the issues.
[00:29] <hydrox24> control-d then?
[00:30] <litropy> excervo, #macdev if you're programming, but they're a little grumpy.
[00:30] <moncapitane> puts me back at the recovery menu
[00:30] <moncapitane> options are resume, clean, dpkg, grub, netroot, root
[00:30] <hydrox24> moncapitane: maybe the best way to go is to boot from a USB or CD and mount the root filesystem from there.
[00:30] <moncapitane> Yea, that is a good idea.
[00:30] <|Anthony|> hydrox24, it's listing a bunch of i386 deps... mostly c libraries and gcc
[00:31] <|Anthony|> is that going to interfere with the 64 bit versions already installed/

[00:45] <zyngawow> ext4
[00:47] <dr_willis> so whats the actual problrm then?  you tell the installer to use one of the ext4's as the / and you get an error?

[01:00] <moncapitane> How do you re-create the passwd file if shadow is fubared?
[01:00] <moncapitane> passwd permissions are 644 and shadow is 640
[01:01] <jrib> moncapitane: you have a /etc/passwd- .  But how did they become fubared?
[01:01] <dr_willis> no idea. manes me wonder why all this broke in the first place

[01:04] <moncapitane> there isn't any entries in passwd or shadow that had the hash for the passwords.  Its just x

[01:04] <moncapitane> is there a way to fully rebuild the /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files?
[01:04] <jrib> moncapitane: you're being too vague.
[01:04] <iceroot> moncapitane: from your backup
[01:05] <moncapitane> iceroot: no backups on the server
[01:05] <moncapitane> i'm not the one who built it.
[01:05] <adfk> how can i uninstall the LPR driver?
[01:05] <jrib> moncapitane: what ubuntu version is this anyway?
[01:05] <moncapitane> 10.04 LTS
[01:05] <iceroot> moncapitane: you could use a live-cd create a user and set the password "foobar" copy the hash and put it in your broken passwd
[01:05] <jrib> moncapitane: so your shadow file had "x" for passwords?  Are you sure?
[01:06] <iceroot> in the shadow of course..

[01:09] <jrib> BlueNeXuS: just ask your question; if someone knows the answer they will help you
[01:09] <BlueNeXuS> it's giving he issues..
[01:09] <iceroot> adfk: you know that ubuntu is not using rpm?
[01:10] <F3Speech> When I sudo /etc/network/inferfaces restart I get the following error ioctl[siocsiwencodeext]: invalid argument can any on help debug this? I also have a maybe related problem that my wifi adaptor will only connect after I've rebooted my router any help would also be apreciated on this.
[01:10] <BlueNeXuS> It cane preinstalled on this ubuntu. and when i try to dowload anything, from any of my broswers it tells me to wait  until the current downlooad finishes because it can not downnload more than one file at a time with that version..  However.. it does that even if its the only one downloading.. hence. i can not download anything at all
[01:11] <BlueNeXuS> I've checked to see if it was a broswer addon and it is now.. I can not find it withing the installed software list eiteher to remove it
[01:11] <adfk> well i installed the cups rpm successfully.
[01:11] <BlueNeXuS> and ideas?
[01:11] <adfk> cups start/running, process 3727
[01:11] <jrib> adfk: erm, you already had cups... how did you install the cups rpm?
[01:11] <iceroot> F3Speech: that is a normal config file and not an init-script
[01:12] <adfk> i installed the LPR driver instead.
[01:12] <iceroot> F3Speech: also ubuntu is using upstart, which means "sudo service networking restart" instead of "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
[01:12] <jrib> BlueNeXuS: how did you install ubuntu?
[01:12] <iceroot> adfk: why you are using rpms?
[01:12] <BlueNeXuS> it's installed as a vm from an .iso
[01:12] <iceroot> adfk: cups is in the normal ubuntu repos
[01:12] <adfk> because i didn't see the .debs on the site...
[01:12] <iceroot> adfk: are you sure you are using ubuntu?
[01:12] <adfk> that i'm sure of.
[01:13] <Freeder> whats the best way to figure out what is causing a high system load? top doesn't show the culprit, its all at 0%
[01:13] <iceroot> adfk: you dont have to go to websites to download software, use "sudo apt-get install packagename"
[01:13] <iceroot> Freeder: even %wa?
[01:13] <jrib> BlueNeXuS: ask the provider of the .iso then.  I have never heard of getjet
[01:13] <jrib> Freeder: if it's all at 0% then there is no high system load
[01:13] <F3Speech> iceroot: i did mean init.d sorry, when i /etc/init.d/networking restart i get the error
[01:14] <BlueNeXuS> if i could find it to unstall it and let the broswers do their own downloading that'd be great
[01:14] <iceroot> F3Speech: use the service command
[01:14] <BlueNeXuS> but thanks jrib
[01:14] <jrib> BlueNeXuS: I would not trust such an .iso.  Who knows what else is on that thing
[01:14] <sneezer> sorry the off-topic but i'm struggling right now with webchat, which irc client do you guys advise me?
[01:15] <jrib> sneezer: try xchat
[01:15] <BlueNeXuS> hrmm.. i suppose i could try installing another download manager and let  it set to default
[01:15] <iceroot> sneezer: try xchat for example, easy to use
[01:15] <F3Speech> iceroot: what command is that?
[01:15] <jrib> BlueNeXuS: why don't you use the official ubuntu iso?
[01:15] <iceroot> F3Speech: also ubuntu is using upstart, which means "sudo service networking restart" instead of "sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart"
[01:15] <sneezer> Thanks, can I use it in Ubunto?
[01:15] <jrib> sneezer: yes
[01:15] <Freeder> jrib: uptime shows a high load.
[01:16] <sneezer> Thank you, and happy new year every one ;)
[01:16] <iceroot> sneezer: you will find xchat in the software center or by using "sudo apt-get install xchat"
[01:16] <iceroot> Freeder: and what is a "high load"?
[01:16] <Freeder> iceroot, not familiar with %wa ?
[01:16] <Freeder> 8
[01:16] <iceroot> Freeder: how much cores?
[01:17] <Freeder> 1
[01:17] <iceroot> Freeder: ok then 8 is high, could you paste the first lines from top?
[01:17] <iceroot> !paste | Freeder
[01:17] <ubottu> Freeder: For posting multi-line texts into the channel, please use http://paste.ubuntu.com | To post !screenshots use http://imagebin.org/?page=add | !pastebinit to paste directly from command line | Make sure you give us the URL for your paste - see also the channel topic.
[01:17] <iceroot> Freeder: Cpu(s):  6.3%us,  1.6%sy,  0.0%ni, 91.7%id,  0.4%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0%st
[01:17] <iceroot> Freeder: that line is important
[01:18] <Freeder> alright, give me a moment, thanks
[01:18] <Freeder> but there is no 'better' tool than top, right?
[01:18] <iceroot> Freeder: and normally %wa is the reason for a high load, its the io waiting time (cpu is waiting for the hdd to deliver data)
[01:18] <F3Speech> iceroot: ran the command and got told stop: unknown instance which i guess makes sense as its not connected. then then ran the same cxommand with start and got told Failed to bring up wlan0
[01:18] <iceroot> F3Speech: you edited /etc/network/interfaces by hand for wlan0?
[01:18] <Freeder> iceroot: where does that %wa go? I see wa listed in the top man, but no reference to a %...
[01:19] <F3Speech> iceroot: yes followed the wiki
[01:19] <iceroot> F3Speech: which wiki is suggesting to edit /etc/network/interfaces to have wifi on a desktop system?
[01:19] <WeThePeople> vlanx, what dist?
[01:19] <F3Speech> im on server
[01:20] <WeThePeople> vlanx, oops, did you figure it out
[01:20] <iceroot> F3Speech: ah ok, so a server without the network-manager way
[01:20] <F3Speech> iceroot:  yes

[01:22] <synrat> asd
[01:23] <phpguy> I Ubuntu 12.10 and I downgraded my flash from 11.2 because it was very buggy.  So i replace libflashplayer.so like the ubuntu forum said to do and now I am hanging on reboot. I have been having no problems until I replaced that file. I have attempted recovery console and livecd and then replacing the file with the original but nothing still hangs. I have even removed quiet splash and replaced with nomodeset and there are no errors.
[01:23] <jrib> phpguy: where exactly did you put the file?
[01:23] <n0yd> lol
[01:23] <phpguy> /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
[01:24] <jrib> phpguy: where exactly is it hanging?
[01:24] <n0yd> just replacing that file would not cause it not to boot
[01:24] <devjosh1> Yeah, I don't see the connection.
[01:25] <phpguy> as soon as the splash screen comes up or when nomodeset it hangs as soon as it the blinking line comes up. That doesn't even blink.
[01:25] <jrib> phpguy: recovery mode boots ok?
[01:25] <phpguy> jrib YES SIR
[01:26] <TommehM> Every time I attempt to boot teamviewer it gives me this error and refuses to boot, http://dropfuse.com/1360
[01:26] <devjosh1> I'm going to boot this 12.10 next to BackTrack5 on my Thinkpad.

[01:26] <phpguy> jrib also tried resume still hangs with no errors just an fyi
[01:26] <devjosh1> Hmm, an SSL error.
[01:26] <jrib> phpguy: what do you mean by "tried resume"?
[01:27] <seeqwell> How can I see if my hard drive is sata, raid or ata on ubuntu please?
[01:27] <phpguy> jrib from Recovery mode
[01:27] <devjosh1> some utility not found...
[01:27] <devjosh1> very strange
[01:27] <phpguy> recovery mode menu*
[01:27] <jrib> phpguy: did you do anything else other than replace that flash file?
[01:27] <n0yd> he had to off, before he replaced the file
[01:27] <Slart> seeqwell: tried the "disk utility" ?
[01:27] <n0yd> s/of/off
[01:28] <phpguy> no I had been coding on my ftp server all day but that was remote.
[01:28] <seeqwell> thanks Slart
[01:28] <Septima> so, i'm reading through this asus motherboard manual and come across the usb 3.0 section. it's got 4 usb 3.0 ports on the board the back panel and 1 header for usb 3.0 on forward ports. it says though, that usb 3.0 is only supported in windows due to limitations set forth by intel for the chipset ports and asmedia for the usb 3.0 controller ports; can someone shed some light on this? true or not?
[01:28] <F3Speech> iceroot: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1490404/ as requested
[01:29] <Septima> the intel chipset in question is the Z77; and i'm mainly wondering, are those ports going to be dead when used with Ubuntu, or can they be made to work like usb 2.0?
[01:29] <Slart> Septima: which asus motherboard is it?
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[01:29] <Septima> Slart: P8Z77-V LE
[01:29] <n0yd> If it is true, its just a driver issue.
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[01:31] <n0yd> the z77 was originally compatible with windows, but it appears it works fine with linux now
[01:31] <Slart> Septima: I have an older asus motherboard (formula 4) and usb 3 works nicely here.. or .. I'm not getting doppler-shifted with speed.. but it seems to be working alright
[01:32] <jrib> phpguy: well as others said, replacing that file certainly shouldn't have anything to do with the issue you are having now.  Have you tried booting an earlier kernel or looking for interesting things in /var/log/?
[01:32] <Septima> n0yd: did you find something on it?
[01:32] <Septima> i haven't had any luck finding anything on it
[01:33] <n0yd> Septima, nothing you couldnt find by googling
[01:33] <phpguy> jrib I have tried booting an earlier kernel and it still hangs. So I am sure the kernel is fine. as to the logs I am looking now
[01:33] <n0yd> z77 is a pretty common chipset
[01:34] <WeThePeople> anybody know how to edit iCall files?
[01:34] <ezrafree> hello all, i am having an issue where suddenly my ubuntu box stops booting after the message "Checking battery state" and I am seeing online that one cause may be I need to reinstall my graphics drivers. only problem is, i have intel graphics card, how can i reinstall the drivers for it?
[01:34] <WeThePeople> i get a upgrade error
[01:34] <n0yd> phpguy, so recovery doesnt actually boot then?
[01:34] <phpguy> nope I can get it to console and thats it
[01:34] <n0yd> well, that is booting....
[01:34] <ezrafree> lspci shows this: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82Q35 Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 02)
[01:35] <ezrafree> does anyone know how to reinstall the drivers for the Intel Corporation 82Q35 Express Integrated Graphics Controller?
[01:35] <phpguy> n0yd no not when you drop to root console in a read only system
[01:36] <phpguy> I did not mean to imply that it booted to console. I have to select drop to root console from the recovery menu.
[01:36] <percent20> can someone say something with my nick in it? am testing something.
[01:36] <n0yd> percent20,
[01:37] <somsip> !test | percent20

[01:38] <n0yd> ezrafree, what are you looking at online, first of all
[01:39] <ezrafree> n0yd: how do you mean?
[01:39] <ezrafree> what website told me it may be a graphics driver issue, you mean?
[01:39] <n0yd> yes
[01:39] <ezrafree> n0yd: ubuntuforums.org
[01:39] <n0yd> '....
[01:39] <n0yd> ok great
[01:40] <F3Speech> Can anyone else look at http://paste.ubuntu.com/1490404/ spot any problems while iceroot gets back, thanks.
[01:40] <n0yd> What..... Article
[01:40] <ezrafree> they said because it stopped right after the "checking battery state" message that it's probably grpahics drivers because that's when the drivers are loaded next
[01:40] <ezrafree> n0yd: i'd have to search and find it, they were using nvidia drivers unlike me, one sec
[01:40] <BluPhenix316> I'm confused about the information on the new Ubuntu Phones, will we be able to use Ubuntu Mobile OS this year, or we have to wait for phones next year?
[01:40] <n0yd> ezrafree, ya, i doubt that is your issue
[01:40] <ezrafree> oh no here it is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1859820
[01:40] <n0yd> dont waste your time
[01:41] <ezrafree> n0yd: okay, any other thoughts on what i could look at it to determine the exact issue?
[01:41] <BluPhenix316> i'm still trying to figure out where i can buy a ubuntu tv
[01:41] <ezrafree> i've checked any logs i could think of but nothing yet
[01:41] <BluPhenix316> anyone know where i can get more information about Ubuntu Phones and TV?
[01:42] <ezrafree> now i get a second error, immediately after "Checking battery state" that says ata2.00: SError: { HostIn 10B8B }
[01:42] <ezrafree> that, i believe, is an issue with my seagate 2TB drive
[01:42] <ezrafree> not sure if they are related though
[01:42] <MMavipc> I want text boot but gui after boot, So I see messages during boot, and at the end of boot the gui starts up. I have the grub default cmdline set to "", but I just see a blank screen now until the gui starts up
[01:43] <ezrafree> hrm I guess I may just have to try reinstalling ubuntu heh
[01:43] <ezrafree> clearly i messed something up real good
[01:43] <n0yd> no idea
[01:43] <kslater> ugh. Well this upgrade hasn't gone well so far. Didn't intent to do a fresh install but I'm basically doing that now since one of my attempts at getting grub going again resulted in my user account being nuked.
[01:44] <kslater> I guess I'll find out just how good backintime is at backups..

[02:11] <Tex_Nick> HowdyDoody : you could then replace and if needed restore the old one
[02:12] <HowdyDoody> ok - cp smb.conf smb.conf.114    good enough  or do I need to put in diff directory?

[02:15] <taofd> where did the menu bar go in nautilus for gnome 3.6? :( how do i access my folder settings now?
[02:16] <acovrig> how do I change the default run level (/etc/inittab does not exist)
[02:17] <jrib> acovrig: why do you want to?
[02:17] <acovrig> jrib: my default run level is 2 and I want 5.
[02:17] <jrib> acovrig: yes, but why?
[02:17] <dr_willis> since ther really is no runlevels with upstart
[02:17] <Slart> !runlevel
[02:17] <ubottu> In Ubuntu all runlevels except 0,1 and 6 are by default equal. Also keep in mind that Ubuntu now uses !Upstart instead of System V init so there is normally no /etc/inittab.
[02:18] <dr_willis> level 5 will be identical to 2
[02:18] <acovrig> !Upstart
[02:18] <ubottu> Upstart is meant to replace the old Sys V Init system with an event-driven init model.  For more information please see: http://upstart.ubuntu.com/
[02:18] <acovrig> then how do I startx by default?
[02:18] <jrib> acovrig: by default you have lightdm installed and it gets started automatically
[02:18] <dr_willis> acovrig:  lightdm service does that if its installed
[02:19] <dr_willis> this is why we were asking why you wanted runlevel 5 ;)
[02:19] <dr_willis> lightdm, gdm, kdm, other login managers haaandle that
[02:19] <taofd> anyone know how to access nautilus settings in gnome 3.6?
[02:20] <jrib> taofd: doesn't it have "preferences" in its menu somewhere?
[02:20] <acovrig> dr_willis: when I boot I only get a cli, I can then run startx, but how do I have this happen automatically?
[02:20] <jrib> acovrig: how did you install ubuntu?
[02:20] <Slart> taofd: open a regular nautilus window and check the global menu
[02:20] <dr_willis> acovrig:  innstall lightdm, gdm, or some other login manager
[02:21] <dr_willis> acovrig:  whis is a server install?
[02:21] <acovrig> jrib: if I remember server install, then decided to use it as a desktop as well so apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
[02:21] <jrib> acovrig: what ubuntu version?
[02:21] <taofd> Slart: i'm using gnome3, i think the global menu thing is a unity specific concept

[02:25] <acovrig> jrib: apt-get says lighted is the newest version.
[02:25] <Slart> taofd: on that computer I'm running archlinux with, I suppose, the regular/standard gnome shell
[02:25] <jrib> acovrig: so now you should figure out why it doesn't start.  Does it start ok if you run "sudo service lightdm start"?
[02:26] <acovrig> jrib: yes
[02:26] <jaehun> haroo~
[02:27] <dr_willis> acovrig:  check /etc/default/grub to be sure you are not using 'text' mode also

[02:34] <haryv> Ubunto is now #1 article in CNN News pulse. I remember long time ago, I used to work at Microsoft in the Windows dev team, and Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer came to the lunch meeting and gave there big pitch about the release of windows 2000. One of the tings Bill or Steve said "Linux is not a threat" I think I was the only one shaking my head :)

[02:36] <jaehun> acovrig,  hmm? r u wanna new network dhcp?
[02:36] <acovrig> dr_willis: it gets annoying to wait 60 seconds for network configuration on every boot though...
[02:37] <evo-int-ano> apt-get nosespray...
[02:37] <acovrig> jaehun: I installed in a xbox, then dd to a physical drive, so theres a new set of interfaces
[02:37] <dr_willis> acovrig:  sounds like you should have just done a clean install instead of  converting aa vbox image

[02:37] <jaehun> check the /etc/network/interface file.
[02:37] <dr_willis> acovrig:  you have removed any vbox guest addations?
[02:37] <Xabster> Who's Mark Shuttleworth and why are people listening to such a bullshit blog?
[02:37] <jaehun> cat /etc/network/interface
[02:38] <acovrig> dr_willis: yea, but I did a vbox install while waiting for the physical parts to arrive. I didn't install the vbox add ons.
[02:38] <jaehun> acevrig : If u not insert dhcp? u need edit interface file.
[02:38] <nearst> hi ubuntu fan
[02:39] <OerHeks> Xabter nice attitude
[02:39] <dr_willis> acovrig:  from what ive seen so far- sounds like its a very wonky install.
[02:39] <jaehun> acovrig, plz.. show to /etc/network/interfaces file.
[02:39] <jaehun> If u waana dhcp? blow example? same to make it.
[02:39] <jaehun> auto eth0
[02:39] <jaehun> iface eth0 inet dhcp
[02:39] <Xabster> OerHeks: thanks..?
[02:39] <acovrig> jaehun: /etc/network/interfaces has no reference to virbr0, but ifconfig shows it
[02:40] <jaehun> hm....
[02:40] <jaehun> It's virtual box?
[02:40] <dr_willis> virbr0 is if you have vbox server installed i thought..
[02:40] <OerHeks> Xabster, Mark Shuttleworth is the fouder of canonical/ubuntu
[02:40] <jaehun> acovrig, I think? u check this web page.
[02:40] <jaehun> http://wiki.libvirt.org/page/Networking
[02:40] <Xabster> okay, what about the 2nd part of the question?
[02:40] <dr_willis> i think i got a virbr0 here and this setup has never been  in a vbox. but it runs vbox
[02:41] <acovrig> dr_willis: its if u use the host-only interface. I heard something about /etc/udev/rules/.d, is there something about that?
[02:41] <nearst> why my ipw2200 is eth1
[02:41] <jaehun> acovrig, http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/serverguide/C/libvirt.html
[02:41] <jaehun> check it plz.. acovrig
[02:41] <dr_willis> acovrig:  must be somthing ive never used then
[02:41] <dr_willis> nearst:  what do you expect it to be?
[02:42] <acovrig> where does ifconfig get it's list of interfaces?

[02:42] <jaehun> u need bridge-utils
[02:42] <nearst> dr_willis, just wonder. hehe
[02:42] <jaehun> hmm? Z?z?z..
[02:43] <dr_willis> nearst:  wlan, or eth0 or other names. depends on the driver the wifi device is using
[02:43] <jaehun> ????? ?? ?????
[02:43] <Slart> gah.. sage.. after 194 minutes of compiling it just errors out with a "error 1"
[02:43] <jrib> Slart: why are you compiling :)
[02:43] <jaehun> Slart,  wow..
[02:43] <nearst> dr_willis, i prefer wlan1, bcoz my rt2800usb is wlan0
[02:43] <acovrig> jaehun: I don't need to bridge interfaces, just 'uninstall' old ones and 'install' new ones
[02:44] <nearst> Slart, try with make -j4
[02:44] <dr_willis> nearst:  different drivers  can use different names
[02:44] <F3Speech> dr_willis: sorry missed your comment before, turned off my qos to might be affecting it but while there got me thinking many duel banding isnt supported? so changed it back to 20Hz and testing now, thanks for reply
[02:44] <nearst> dr_willis, yeah. maybe.
[02:44] <acovrig> running /etc/init.d/networking restart is taking a while...
[02:44] <dr_willis> i dont recall a usb wifi dongle ever using  eth*
[02:44] <jaehun> yes...
[02:44] <Slart> jrib: because sage is a weird package.. they end up packaging everything.. so it's a huuge download every time they do an update.. it's actually easier to just update the source and just recompile the bits that changed.. when the compiling part works, that is =)
[02:44] <dr_willis> internal wifi cards i have seen use eth*
[02:44] <jaehun> acovrig,  and?
[02:44] <Slart> nearst: -j 4 ... will try
[02:44] <jaehun> nothing?
[02:45] <jrib> Slart: I just use the binaries
[02:45] <Slart> nearst: or.. -j4, sorry
[02:45] <nearst> Slart, -j4 just fine. depends on your processor core
[02:45] <Slart> jrib: mm.. I blame archlinux.. I have to keep versions matched with my work-laptop
[02:45] <acovrig> jaehun: why is it taking so long to restart networking?
[02:45] <F3Speech> acovrig: i have the same problem, but until im putting it down to have no eth0 connected?
[02:46] <jaehun> acovrig, I think? ur networks problem.. dhcp...

I'm a newbie. sorry for the novel of a question. does anyone have a solution?-  I have a newly custom-built cpu that I successfully loaded with Ubuntu 12.10 and upgraded to the latest kernel.

I have downloaded the “Wine Windows Program Loader” which has helped me to access some files on the MB Support CD, but the Setup.exe is still having error.

[03:37] <dylan> I know the jack works
[03:37] <dylan> I tested it on a LiveCD 5 minutes ago
[03:37] <Tazy> dylan, then it should be as simple to just change uhm default device or for a single program to send to headphones/device

[03:40] <F3Speech> thanks Tazy , whats the differance between shutdown -H and -P ?
[03:40] <somsip> alex285: oh - like with spaces in the name?
[03:41] <dr_willis> ive never seen a folder named   ${somthing}  befor... sounds like a bash script messed up
[03:41] <alex285> dr_willis, that didnt remove it
[03:41] <Tazy> dylan just messing around with those settings in both apps might fix it somehow, i had my soundcard to work after i muted and unmuted it
[03:41] <dr_willis> whats the exact name?
[03:41] <dr_willis> and the exact command you used
[03:41] <Tazy> alex285, it might be possible to rm *blabla* instead of $blabla$ (use with caution)
[03:41] <alex285> dr_willis, ${prefix}
[03:41] <dfrey> Is there a known problem with sound cards right now?  I just rebooted my computer (a couple times) and my sound doesn't work anymore
[03:42] <alex285> thats is the exactly name
[03:42] <OerHeks> F3Speech,  -H     Requests that the system be halted after it has been brought down and   -P     Requests that the system be powered off after it has been brought down ( see man shutdown)
[03:42] <dr_willis> that a file or directory?
[03:42] <dylan> erm, the puslseaudo volume control has a little bar in the settings that shows you how loud te sound that is playing is.  that bar moves when stuff is playing
[03:42] <alex285> Tazy, thanx that did the trick!
[03:43] <alex285> dr_willis, was a directory
[03:43] <dr_willis> tab completion  might escape things also
[03:43] <F3Speech> OerHeks: Thats what I read but im unclear as to the difference of hald and power off, as i thought halt did power off?
[03:44] <OerHeks> F3Speech, nope, halt keeps the system on.
[03:44] <Tazy> F3Speech, shutdown --help  might give more info
[03:44] <F3Speech> OerHeks: can you still ssh in etc after the system is halted i would assume all services have been stopped
[03:45] <dylan> Tazy: Just checked everything, nothing is muted or anything.  I even toggled all the settings once or twice
[03:45] <F3Speech> OerHeks: im thining what would you want to halt and not reboot or shutdown?
[03:45] <acovrig> I think my boot hangs at waiting for network configuration because it is trying to bring up an interface that doesn't exist, how do I fix this?
[03:47] <OerHeks> F3Speech, halt was used before ACPI (which today will turn off the power for you)*. It would halt the system and then print a message to the effect of "it's ok to power off now"
[03:47] <dr_willis> acovrig:  or its an ipv6 issue. ;) it always gets blamed
[03:47] <kslater> before I decide to reboot (after having no success at all today with grub and booting), is there a way I can check to see if all of the packages the upgrade tried to install, have been installed without issue?
[03:47] <F3Speech> OerHeks:  ahhhhhhhhh, tyvm, that make alot of sense :)
[03:47] <kslater> I know it barfed on initramfs-tools before
[03:48] <kslater> maybe a way to list the installation status of all packages?

[03:50] <kslater> this indicates that these two packages are installed properly?

[03:50] <devnull_> i have a new hp dv6-7013cl and i can't get my built in subwoofer to work .... i have snd-hda-intel loaded ... have tried different model= variables ... i can virtually get 6 channels but i still have no subwoofer
[03:50] <devnull_> i have already googled the crap out of this for about 20 hours
[03:50] <Tazy> dylan, you can still google for ppl with similar issue, i myself never had a usb headset. tough it might be crazy but there should be a .pulse folder in ~/  it fixed for me some issues as i deleted it (probably you want to just move this folder, and restart pulse / pkill pulse)
[03:51] <acovrig> dr_willis: I removed everything but lo in /etc/network/interfaces and now it works fine, but I still don't like virbr0 in ifconfig, yet if I ifconfig virbr0 down, it disappears, why is it up to begin with (and how do I stop that)?
[03:51] <devnull_> wondering if anyone has any ideas
[03:53] <Tazy> devnull_, similar issue with X-Fi here. you can google jackd with pulseaudio ubuntu. and then loop an input via qjackctrl to subwoofer. (i suspect a ubuntu bug)
[03:54] <devnull_> tazy .. that is an interesting way to do it ... i will check it out ... i think there is definately a bug
[03:54] <dylan> Tazy: I'm not seeing a .pulse folder
[03:54] <devnull_> damn beats audio
[03:55] <Tazy> dylan, folders with .at the beginning are hidden (prolly ctrl +h nows em)
[03:55] <dylan> idn't work
[03:55] <dylan> didn't*
[03:56] <Tazy> devnull_, if you have subwoofer after switching speakers on the same music track then its a bug.
[03:56] <dylan> Tazy: cntrl+h did nothing
[03:57] <devnull_> tazy .. i have no subwoofer at all atm  ... im wondering if the sub is like an internal usb or something
[03:57] <dylan> found it
[03:57] <Tazy> dylan, terminal: mv ~/.pulse ~/.pulse-old  (reverse to restore...)
[03:58] <dylan> Tazy: did nothing
[03:58] <Tazy> devnull_, anyhow you get better sound via jack and pulseaudio jack sink ;D plus you can use IDJC
[03:58] <machicola> anyone happen to know if there is a way that I can make 'k' & 'j' my up and down arrows in Ubuntus X windows
[03:59] <machicola> i mean, to do the same thing the up and down arrows do... scroll up or down
[03:59] <Tazy> dylan if you killed pulseaudio it should restart and recreate the folder. if the headset wont work then its some other bug..

[04:18] <Matthe> Hello,
[04:19] <Matthe> I need some information about the difference between the latest version, and the older versions.
[04:19] <Tazy> devnull_, probably just requires to change /etc/pulse/default.pa and install qjackctrl (with deps)
[04:21] <Matthe> So, can someone send me like, a link or something, with the information?
[04:21] <jrib> !notes | Matthe
[04:21] <ubottu> Matthe: Ubuntu 12.10 (Quantal Quetzal) release notes can be found here http://ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/12.10
[04:22] <jrib> Matthe: in general, you should either go with the latest release (12.10) or with the latest LTS release (12.04).  The advantage of the LTS release is that it is supported for 5 years instead of the usual 18 months.  But 12.10 has newer features and newer software
[04:22] <OerHeks> and 12.04 LTS >> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PrecisePangolin/ReleaseNotes
[04:22] <Tazy> LTS is a better choice. time wise.
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest66224
[04:23] <Matthe> Well, I'm working on a project for school, and I need to have the exact information about the difference between, 12.10 and the rest.

[04:26] <davidhurwich> hello
[04:26] <davidhurwich> can i ask a tech support question>
[04:26] <davidhurwich> ?
[04:27] <ryzzan> my wifi connection keep failing all the time under ubuntu 12.04... any tip?
[04:27] <OerHeks> hi davidhurwich, just ask :-)
[04:27] <ryzzan> ?
[04:27] <davidhurwich> i'm running Ubuntu 12-04. my wifi never seems to show up. It used to appear under earlier versions of Ubuntu. Any ideas?
[04:28] <Tazy> PC's with EFI bios won't have a issue with GRUB2/syslinux?
[04:28] <ryzzan> mine shows... but it fails after some time
[04:28] <kslater> ok, time to bite the bullet and try a reboot. Then one more upgrade to get to 12.04.1 LTS.
[04:30] <juniour> chrome is not godd forubuntu
[04:30] <zabomber> davidhuriwch: try http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1966633
[04:30] <dr_willis> chrome works fine  here.
[04:30] <deltab> ryzzan: are there any log entries that relate to it?
[04:30] <kslater> I've had it absolutely crash the desktop before
[04:31] <kslater> maybe newer Ubuntu plays better with it?
[04:31] <dr_willis> ive seen flash crash the internet. ;)
[04:31] <juniour>  dr_willis its dosent work fine here
[04:31] <dr_willis> ok just my home pc...
[04:31] <juniour> 3:)
[04:32] <kslater> yeah, flash probably behind a lot of crashing
[04:32] <kslater> a flash crash
[04:32] <dr_willis> i rarely see people in here with chrome issues...   flash issues..  lots of them
[04:32] <juniour>  dr_willis ya you right
[04:32] <HeKToN> dr_willis what do you mean by flash issues ?
[04:33] <HeKToN> my youtube is kind of laggy while the menus are visible
[04:33] <HeKToN> like the timeline ?
[04:33] <juniour> chrome has flsh issue
[04:33] <ryzzan> deltab, not really... what log file u think i should take a look in this case/
[04:33] <HeKToN> im on firefox but ..
[04:33] <akheel> hey guys, I'm running on an AMD graphics card. Any way to install drivers to make gnome-shell run more smoothly? animation is really choppy right now
[04:33] <juniour> firefox rocks
[04:33] <dr_willis> HeKToN:  smurfy looking people, no sound, crashes, not detected..    webcams not working with it. wrong monitors and fullscreen issues....
[04:33] <ryzzan> deltab, i receive no warning or anything... the conenction simply fails... like the wifi is not connected to the internet
[04:34] <HeKToN> so I was basically scared that my lap top is crap
[04:34] <dr_willis> those are the common flash issues
[04:34] <HeKToN> but now you give me the feeling that it is the flash
[04:34] <HeKToN> otherwise the movies are excellent
[04:34] <dr_willis> id bet its flash the issue.
[04:34] <dr_willis> use a flash downloader, or replacer plugin ;)
[04:34] <Muphrid> just dont use flash whenever possible
[04:34] <Tazy> Smurf ppl are best issue and NVRM issues even more.
[04:34] <dr_willis> or both
[04:35] <akheel> I'm on 12.10 by the way
[04:35] <Muphrid> akheel: what gpu model?
[04:35] <HeKToN> can you give me exact command or whatever how to do that ?
[04:35] <HeKToN> plaese
[04:36] <juniour1>  dr_willis
[04:36] <Muphrid> HeKToN do what?
[04:36] <Tazy> speaking of, anyone knows whats NVRM Xid ? nvidia related but maybe RAM itself? instead of gfx

[04:37] <Muphrid> HeKToN: go to userscripts.org and search for viewtube
[04:37] <Muphrid> that is for videos
[04:37] <HeKToN> thanks ;)
[04:37] <Muphrid> it has a downloader too
[04:37] <akheel> muphrid: how do I check?
[04:37] <juniour1> davidhurwich you getting the signal
[04:38] <davidhurwich> i used to get the signal. my network doesn't appear now
=== juniour1 is now known as juniour
[04:38] <Tazy> davidhurwich, your network is set to hidden?
[04:38] <davidhurwich> i thought i've installed the necessary drivers for my wireless card
[04:39] <Muphrid> akheel: lspci -v | grep -A 10 radeon
[04:39] <davidhurwich> no, my wife's macbook is picking it up fine
[04:39] <Muphrid> or you could use HardInfo for a gui
[04:39] <juniour> davidhurwich connect via lan upgrade to additional drivers
[04:39] <davidhurwich> where do i find out which extra drivers i need?
[04:40] <Muphrid> davidhurwich: search for "software sources" app
[04:40] <Tazy> lsmod to see if the driver is even loaded..?
[04:40] <juniour> davidhurwich additional drivers type in search in unity
[04:40] <akheel> Muphrid: Audio device: Advanced Micro Devices [AMD] nee ATI Device 9902
[04:40] <Muphrid> that is audio
[04:41] <davidhurwich> would i findt he software sources app in the Ubuntu Software Center?
[04:41] <akheel> I see PCI bridge, but no graphics there
[04:41] <Muphrid> i think lspci alone will say, i dont know why i said -v
[04:41] <usr13> davidhurwich: jockey-gtk
[04:41] <juniour> davidhurwich just install the additional driver your issue will besolved
[04:42] <Muphrid> akheel: like this: Display controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/GME, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
[04:42] <davidhurwich> but where do i find it?
[04:42] <davidhurwich> thats what I'm not sure about
[04:42] <usr13> davidhurwich: jockey-gtk
[04:42] <Emanon> usr13: Stop being vague.
[04:42] <juniour> davidhurwich click on dash home and type
[04:42] <Emanon> davidhurwich: just hit the windows key and type source
[04:43] <akheel> Muphrid: I don't see a display controller there
[04:43] <juniour> davidhurwich window key and type additional drivers
[04:43] <akheel> Is it possible it is not detecting it? I had to boot with nomodeset
[04:43] <davidhurwich> under Broadcom STA wireless Driver it says it is activated and currently in use
[04:43] <akheel> I'm running a Pavilion g6
[04:43] <OerHeks> Emanon, jockey-gtk is the driver tool in ubuntu
[04:43] <Muphrid> akheel: install hardinfo then
[04:43] <wanfu> akheel, what exact model of the g6?
[04:43] <davidhurwich> what should i do now?
[04:44] <akheel> wanfu: g6-2123us
[04:44] <Emanon> I'm aware OerHeks but no one was giving the poor guy complete instructions.
[04:44] <juniour> davidhurwich u sure its activated
[04:44] <davidhurwich> the dialogue box says it is
[04:44] <Emanon> They were giving data without context.
[04:44] <juniour> if not click on activate
[04:44] <Muphrid> AMD Radeon HD 7520G
[04:44] <Muphrid> ok that is your card
[04:44] <juniour> you seegreen button
[04:45] <Emanon> davidhurwich: Check if the wifi card has been deactivated via a hardware switch or keyboard hotkey.
[04:45] <usr13> davidhurwich: Run:  jockey-gtk    Alt-F2   or from terminal window.
[04:45] <akheel> any idea how to install a driver that doesn't give me 8 FPS on basic window operation?
[04:45] <akheel> I'm spoiled with nvidia drivers so this one is certainly new
[04:46] <ripthejacker> how do i add google repos to software sources?
[04:46] <davidhurwich> running jockey-gtk says that broadcast STA wireless driver is installed
[04:46] <dr_willis> ripthejacker:  i recall when i installlled the google-chrome.deb it added them
[04:46] <davidhurwich> and it lists BCM versions
[04:46] <Emanon> akheel: I'm not sure if you're getting display issues but I've noticed my rated frame rate is quite a bit lower than my observed framerate when using Ubuntu and I think it is due to the compositioning window manager rather than poor driver support ymmv though.
[04:46] <davidhurwich> and ideas?
[04:47] <usr13> davidhurwich: You have a wireless card that you need to use?
[04:47] <juniour> davidhurwich update and upgrade and restart pc
[04:47] <Tazy> davidhurwich, as a last resort you could replace networkmanager with wicd
[04:47] <juniour> davidhurwich sudo aptget update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[04:47] <davidhurwich> update what? The dialogue box says the wireless driver is instaled
[04:48] <juniour> davidhurwich sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[04:48] <akheel> Emanon: I can barely view Youtube videos as well, so I know it's a graphics issue
[04:48] <akheel> the video skips every half second so I barely see animation
[04:48] <ripthejacker> dr_willis, i get this error when i try to install chrome
[04:48] <ripthejacker> http://pastebin.mozilla.org/2035108
[04:48] <Emanon> Ok, as you were then I just noticed that on my system.

[04:49] <Hebbes> install hangs during the Ubuntu load screen
[04:49] <akheel> Ahh ok. I'm doing this for a friend of mine and I realized the lack of framerate. I think I've got everything else squared away
[04:49] <ripthejacker> Hebbes, you're installing from a cd or usb drive?
[04:49] <Hebbes> can anyone help me?
[04:50] <dr_willis> ripthejacker:  id hit up google with that exact error message. seems the .deb is confused to me
[04:50] <Emanon> When I run an fps counter on Compiz I get an abysmally low rated fps but everything seems snappy from my perspective so I was just wondering if there was possibly some disparity. If you are getting actually bad graphical performance then that is a different story entirely.

[05:16] <davidhurwich> no, no network shows up. It used to in earlier versions
[05:16] <devnull_> oh
[05:16] <devnull_> does netmanager show wireless enabled ?
[05:16] <grm> It seems that ubuntu 12.04 can't completely support computer with chip intel 420
[05:17] <davidhurwich> is there a way to check that?
[05:17] <davidhurwich> to grm
[05:17] <devnull_> what version of ubuntu ?
[05:17] <grm> my computer always  crash
[05:17] <davidhurwich> my net manger is set to "enable networking"
[05:17] <devnull_> grm what is intel 420 chip ?
[05:18] <devnull_> davidhurwich, okay ... and it doesn't say enable wireless  ?
[05:18] <davidhurwich> it says enable Networking, but my network does not come up
[05:18] <SailorMoon> His wireless driver needs loaded/installed
[05:19] <SailorMoon> I'm too new to assist with that, though.
[05:19] <grm> Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU 420 @1.60GHz, my computer configuration.
=== HeKToN is now known as HeKToN|sleep
[05:19] <tehwilder> lol420
[05:20] <devnull_> grm .... what you need to do is figure out what the other pieces of your system are using ... video, sound, etc and see if maybe there are better drivers for them
[05:20] <devnull_> davidhurwich, what version of ubuntu ?
[05:20] <davidhurwich> 12-04
=== Albastos|off is now known as Albastos
[05:20] <HeKToN|sleep> !group
[05:20] <grm> thank, I will try.
[05:20] <SailorMoon> have david type that terminal command that will tell him/us the wireless devices name
[05:20] <devnull_> grm ... is it a laptop ?
[05:21] <grm> no, Desktop
[05:21] <devnull_> davidhurwich, lspci | grep -i network
[05:21] <devnull_> grm ... gotcha ... was it custom or a prebuilt model ?
[05:22] <davidhurwich> broadcom corp BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)
[05:22] <devnull_> oh
[05:22] <SailorMoon> Thats what i figured, thats what i installed just two hours ago, davidhurwich lol
[05:22] <devnull_> davidhurwich,  .... bcm53 or 54 i used to use with my hp laptop through ndiswrapper
[05:23] <devnull_> when i upgraded to 12.04 .... it stopped using ndsiwrapper ... the b43 module should work i think
[05:23] <davidhurwich> so, will my driver not work with 12-04?
[05:23] <grm> maybe not. I don't know.
[05:23] <abrandt> Anyone have issues with partitioned HDD running 12.04 and Win8?
[05:23] <devnull_> davidhurwich, im just guessing .. i had a similar card to yours ... i think it was like b43 or b3 or something like that
[05:24] <SailorMoon> its b43
[05:24] <devnull_> insmod b43   and see if your networking comes up
[05:24] <SailorMoon> i believe ubuntu has a way to use these drivers in the additional drivers section of that area where you pick package repos. i dunno what its called
[05:25] <devnull_> software sources ... will give you access to proprietary drivers ... but b43 is open
[05:25] <SailorMoon> it will be there
[05:25] <davidhurwich> how do i access software sources?
[05:25] <dr_willis>   12.10  software sources tool. has the addational drivers tab
[05:25] <devnull_> grm ... if there is a model number for your computer ... do a google search for .. your model and ubuntu x.x
[05:25] <kslater> woohoo! Reboot worked fine.
[05:25] <SailorMoon> oh, 12.04 doesnt have it, dr_willis?
[05:25] <kslater> On to 12.04.1 I guess
[05:25] <dr_willis> search for it via the dash
[05:26] <dr_willis> 12.04 has jockey-gtk
[05:26] <devnull_> davidhurwich,  it should be in system settings
[05:26] <devnull_> oh yes .. jockey
[05:26] <sarahr> hiya
[05:26] <dr_willis> or just apt-get install what you need
[05:26] <davidhurwich> no software sources
[05:26] <devnull_> grm ... it isi possible the issue you are having has already been taken care of
[05:26] <sarahr> This is probably the first time I've been on IRC in maybe…15 years?
[05:27] <devnull_> davidhurwich, do you have ubuntu software center ?
[05:27] <devnull_> sarahr :)
[05:27] <davidhurwich> yes
[05:27] <devnull_> davidhurwich, load it .. then i think it is like edit -> software sources
[05:27] <sarahr> geeing out on ubuntu brought me back
[05:27] <sarahr> "geeking"
[05:27] <devnull_> davidhurwich, though ... 12.04 might not have the tab for drivers
[05:27] <sarahr> is the channel just for support, or is this a place to nerd out, too?
[05:27] <dr_willis> 12
[05:28] <dr_willis> 12.04  run   jockey-gtk
[05:28] <devnull_> sarahr .... mostly support
[05:28] <somsip> !support | sarahr
[05:28] <ubottu> sarahr: The official ubuntu support channel is #ubuntu. Also see http://ubuntu.com/support and http://ubuntuforums.org and http://askubuntu.com
[05:28] <sarahr> dev - where do ubuntu fans chat?
[05:28] <dr_willis> 12.10 find that tab...
[05:28] <davidhurwich> ok
[05:28] <somsip> sarahr: #ubuntu-offtopic for related but not support
[05:28] <sarahr> rad
[05:28] <devnull_> sarahr .. not sure ... there is probably offtopic channel
[05:28] <davidhurwich> I'm in software sources, now what?
[05:28] <sarahr> thanks!
[05:29] <devnull_> davidhurwich, from the menu ... edit -> software sources
[05:29] <Gnea> !nvidia
[05:29] <ubottu> For Ati/NVidia/Matrox video cards, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VideoDriverHowto
[05:29] <kslater> how does one go about adding stuff to 'status' bar at the top of the screen?
[05:29] <devnull_> davidhurwich, if that doesn't have a drivers tab ... do what dr_willis has explained with jockey-gtk
[05:29] <devnull_> kslater, unfortunately ... the applications have to be specificaly written now to be on that bar i believe
[05:29] <davidhurwich> i have a a ubuntu software, other software, updates, authentication, statsitics
[05:30] <devnull_> davidhurwich, okay you will need jockey-gtk then
[05:30] <davidhurwich> ran the command
[05:30] <kslater> devnull_: I used to have a status app that would show load factor, network traffic, cpu load and memory. Not available any longer?
[05:30] <davidhurwich> it opened additional drivers
[05:30] <devnull_> kslater ... it is annoying .. a lot of stuff that used to sit in the notification area no longer will
[05:30] <devnull_> kslater .. i have that ... i will give you the name .. hold on
[05:30] <davidhurwich> it says my broadcom STA wireless driver is activated
[05:31] <devnull_> indicator-multiload
[05:31] <devnull_> davidhurwich, okay .. well that is a step in the right direction
[05:31] <devnull_> davidhurwich ... ifconfig  ... does wlan0 show up ?
[05:32] <SailorMoon> davidhurwich: connect it to the internet using ethernet, and try sudo apt-get install firmware-b43-installer
[05:32] <devnull_> sailormoon ....... fantastic idea
[05:32] <juniour> kslater sudo apt-get install indicator-multiload
[05:32] <devnull_> kslater, there aren't as many indicator in the repos any more ... a lot of them have to be gotten from outside
[05:33] <grm> devnull_, i am sorry. 12.04LTS, and model might be Inter Corp.
[05:33] <SailorMoon> i use gnome classic, like a noob.
[05:33] <redengin> anyone know how to get bonding to work with netmanager for wlan nics?
[05:33] <dr_willis> askubuntu.com had a big list of indicator applets
[05:34] <grm> 32 bits
[05:34] <devnull_> i only use indicator-multi and indicator-cpufreq-selector
[05:34] <devnull_> grm ... are you still having crashing issues ? you can always check the logs to see what went wrong .. that might help pinpoint what needs to be adjusted
[05:35] <devnull_> ubuntu does what it can to match drivers but sometimes you need to change them
[05:36] <devnull_> or like me right now ... tyring to get my 5 speakers on my laptop working correctly ... odd driver issues
[05:36] <grm> devnull_, Yes, thank you. I try to download a new drives.
[05:37] <devnull_> cant get my subwoofer to work
[05:37] <kslater> devnull_: thanks for that. It's surprising how much I look at that thing during a normal day
[05:37] <devnull_> kslater, me too ... that was one of the first things i installed
[05:37] <SailorMoon> davidhurwich: still with us?
[05:37] <devnull_> for me it is because i got a new laptop so i want to see how it handles and how the load is
[05:38] <davidhurwich> sorry
[05:38] <davidhurwich> i uninstaleld the driver
[05:38] <davidhurwich> and reboot
[05:38] <davidhurwich> and now it seems to find the network. weird
[05:38] <devnull_> cool
[05:38] <kslater> maybe he should get sshd up and running and allow someone to have a closer look.
[05:38] <juniour> davidhurwich try this an tell output
[05:39] <juniour> iwlist wlan0 scan
[05:39] <devnull_> so if anyone has any ideas how to get my beats audio speakers under 4.1 profile in ubuntu 12.10 that would be great ... i have no subwoofer
[05:40] <davidhurwich> it spit out a lot, anything particular you want?
[05:40] <juniour> the above command scan the wifi in range
[05:40] <devnull_> that is good that it has output
[05:40] <juniour> yea
[05:41] <davidhurwich> ok, yeah it did
[05:41] <davidhurwich> maybe i had two drivers installed?
[05:41] <devnull_> some type of conflict ... or the wrong order
[05:41] <juniour> it means you car is reading the signal
[05:41] <davidhurwich> maybe thats why it didn't work until i uninstalled one
[05:41] <juniour> it means you card is reading the signal
[05:41] <kslater> devnull_: I actually like this one (indicator-multiload) better than the old version
[05:41] <kaeza> hello
[05:41] <devnull_> kslater, a lot more information in the drop down menu
[05:42] <juniour> davidhurwich try this
[05:42] <davidhurwich> thanks for everyone help, i really appreciate it
[05:42] <devnull_> kslater, if you have a cpu that changes frequency ... i suggest indicator-cpufreq-selector .. lets you adjust the governor
[05:42] <kaeza> I think I borked my ubuntu box
[05:42] <davidhurwich> no junior. i uninstalled my driver and now my network works :)
[05:42] <devnull_> kaeza what happened ? ... and how does that make you feel ?  :)
[05:42] <kslater> I have a dual core centrino
[05:42] <kaeza> I uninstalled Unity and now I can't boot
[05:42] <juniour> iwlist wlan0 scan | grep -i "ESSID"
[05:43] <kaeza> I have IceWM installed
[05:43] <devnull_> kaeza what do you mean by can't boot ... don't get to the GUI to login ... or it won't get past the bios ?
[05:43] <kaeza> how can I make Ubuntu use it?
[05:43] <kaeza> s/boot/login/
[05:43] <devnull_> if you can get to the login screen ... you should be able to change your session
[05:43] <devnull_> and pick your other windowmanager
[05:44] <davidhurwich> once again thanks to everyone for your help. I really appreciate it
[05:44] <longrun> hey guys need help with service iss-realsecure
[05:44] <longrun> hey guys need help with service iss-realsecure?
[05:44] <dr_willis> icewm is rather.. primitive these days
[05:44] <kaeza> it just says "falied lo run 'ubuntu'" or something like that
[05:44] <davidhurwich> just out of curiosity, what IRC chat clients do you use on ubuntu?
[05:44] <devnull_> davidhurwich, thats what everyone is here for :)
[05:44] <kaeza> and won't respond to keypresses
[05:44] <ibt> anyone know why I can't download 12.10? Tried all day today and it just gets a ways and hangs.

[05:44] <kaeza> nope

[05:45] <HeKToN|sleep> morphid
[05:45] <kaeza> I'm scrwd right?
[05:45] <devnull_> kaeza .. maybe you need to install GDM .. or what ever they are using now
[05:45] <longrun> service iss-realsecure opens tcp port.. how do i close it
[05:45] <devnull_> kaeza ... i don't think so
[05:45] <longrun> >
[05:45] <kslater> how well do these later version handle multiple monitors? I guess I'm going to have to find out tomorrow morning
[05:45] <juniour> davidhurwich :)
[05:45] <HeKToN|sleep> Muphrid, I found the scripts for the youtube flashplayer stuff but I have no idea how to install such a things yet
[05:45] <devnull_> kslater, haven't gotten to really test my hdmi output .. but it seems to handle it pretty well .... works better with the proprietary ATI fglrx drivers though
[05:46] <kaeza> devnull_: may I PM?
[05:46] <devnull_> kaeza, sure
[05:46] <Muphrid> HeKToN|sleep: just give me the link and i guide you

[05:48] <kslater> devnull_: What I used to have (at work before my current health problems demoted me to a contractor), was 2 monitors plugged into my docking station for my laptop.
[05:48] <Muphrid> HeKToN: what browser are you using?
[05:48] <HeKToN> firefox

[05:49] <Saik> hello everyone. I need to know how to fix a connection issue from a VM online. I can access certain things on the machine from my pc, but not everyting as it would if I was using my localhost
[05:49] <kslater> The laptop wouldn't automagically switch, but I had a quick script I ran to switch between the laptop LCD and the two external monitors. It was manual and a pain, but it worked well.
[05:49] <devnull_> kslater, i think you will be fine
[05:49] <kslater> ideally, it would notice that it was in the docking station and just flip to the external monitors.
=== rajesh is now known as Guest85742
[05:50] <kslater> there was/is a udev event for the docking and undocking events
[05:50] <kslater> anyway, for another time.
[05:50] <Guest85742> hi
[05:50] <rsv> What svn gui client is best in ubuntu
[05:50] <eos_> hi everybody! I have segmentation fault on gimp .... ubuntu 12.10 64 bit, gimp from rep
[05:50] <eos_> anyone with the same problem? anyone who knows how to solve?
[05:51] <Guest85742> I have more question about ubuntu server secure some one can help me
[05:51] <bazhang> Guest85742, try #ubuntu-server
[05:51] <kslater> I'm still getting used to Unity
[05:51] <kslater> I don't hate it, but I'm not sold on it yet either
[05:52] <dr_willis> it works well for me.
[05:52] <devnull_> kslater, took me like a few days and i got used to it .... i had it turned off till i upgraded to 12.10
[05:52] <bazhang> rsv, there is no best, check the package manager and choose which suits the most
[05:52] <devnull_> if you get your notification area together and use compiz to give yourself some quick bindings to things you will get used to it fast
[05:52] <AlcariTheMad> so i've got an openvz-based ubuntu 11.04 vm, and `init` is currently using 80-90% of the cpu; due to the fact that it's openvz (i think), i can't do `strace -p 1` to find out what it's doing, and can't think of any reason it might usefully be using that much processor time
[05:52] <eos_> does gimp work for everybody?
[05:52] <AlcariTheMad> any ideas?
[05:53] <kslater> where is it that I turn on extra effects? Used to be in Appearance I thought.
[05:53] <rsv> bazhang:  i dont know how to check in package manager
[05:53] <longrun> service iss-realsecure not listed in ps -aux, /etc/services. but opens tcp port.. how do i close it?

[06:01] <devnull_> prishabh, awesome
[06:01] <longrun> but why is iss-realsecure detected. that is an IDS for complex systems, atleast not for a home pc
[06:01] <devnull_> longrun, why are you assuming it is iss-realsecure ?
[06:03] <longrun> that service is detected as so... found it to be vmware only.. thanks for the help.. killed all vmware processes and its gone.. thanks to everyone
[06:03] <devnull_> cool
[06:04] <devnull_> and understand that a localhost scan will possibly return more ports than are available from the outside
[06:04] <maqr> how can i do an 'upgrade' while omitting any packages that would require a reboot?
[06:04] <longrun> i know. so i ran the full scan. i mean through wan
[06:04] <devnull_> longrun, okay cool
[06:04] <OerHeks> longrun, any port can be used by more than one service > http://www.speedguide.net/port.php?port=902
[06:04] <maqr> i didn't do a dist-upgrade, but it still wants to upgrade 'linux-base' and 'linux-image-*', both of which are flagged reboot-required
[06:05] <longrun> yep. got it.
[06:05] <devnull_> maqr ... why would you want to do this
[06:05] <devnull_> maqr ... you can update all you want ... until you reboot those specific changes will not go into effect
[06:06] <maqr> devnull_: i'm deploying an instance on ec2, and i want the latest packages, but i will never reboot the instance, so there's no point in letting anything with reboot-required update
[06:06] <troop> hello, it is not problem but my boot screen ( purple screen )  has gone after nvidia installation. and now i see text
[06:06] <devnull_> i still don't understand
[06:06] <devnull_> maqr .. im not sure if the reboot is required to finish the update .. or just to bring you into the new kernel
[06:07] <devnull_> maqr ..  you are making an image ?
[06:07] <maqr> devnull_: /var/run/reboot-required.pkgs lists "linux-image-3.7.0-7-generic" and "linux-base" as the packages that triggered it, but i don't know why 'aptitude -y -q upgrade' would ever cause those packages to upgrade... that sounds like something dist-upgrade would do
[06:08] <maqr> devnull_: nope, i'm using 13.04 from here http://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/locator/ec2/
[06:08] <devnull_> maqr ... they treat the kernel like any other piece of software ... when there is an update you get it
[06:08] <devnull_> maqr ... gotcha
[06:08] <devnull_> not sure how that cloud stuff works
[06:09] <maqr> devnull_: well, if there was a switch for aptitude that said "omit all packages tagged reboot-required", that would be ideal
[06:09] <devnull_> it still doesn't make sense to do that

[06:09] <devnull_> maqr .... well it will install the new one ... it will be available
[06:10] <dr_willis> what a strange requirement. ;)

[06:11] <maqr> devnull_: i guess i'll just leave it, it's not going to hurt anything
[06:11] <maqr> other than a silly message when i ssh in :P
[06:11] <devnull_> but once that image does boot .. it should be on the new kernel
[06:12] <maqr> it'll never boot :P
[06:12] <devnull_> im not sure how that actually works though ... it just boots an image ? does the image not have files that change in it
[06:12] <devnull_> oh ... i think i get it now .... yea ... you will just constantly get that message about rebooting
[06:12] <maqr> devnull_: it loads the image from something called an 'ami', Amazon Machine Image, which gives you pretty stock working ubuntu install... then you fill in something called 'user-data' which runs through 'cloud-init' (also an ubuntu initiative), which essentially runs any shell scripts or whatever that you'd want
[06:13] <devnull_> okay
[06:13] <maqr> devnull_: in my case, the first thing my cloud-init script does is a system update/upgrade, which is leaving me with this silly message about rebooting :)
[06:13] <devnull_> btw you can omit those packages
[06:13] <longrun> nothing will truly upgrade or update without rebooting or restarting... the old version runs as long as that service restarted/rebooted..
[06:14] <longrun> once after reboot/restart, then only the new versions starts working
[06:14] <maqr> i suppose i could just null out the /var/run/reboot-required stuff
[06:14] <devnull_> you can just mask them i think
[06:14] <hendry> i can't find "System settings" on my Ubuntu 12.04 install. could I have uninstalled it?
[06:14] <maqr> longrun: ok, as long as i'm not in some half-way state, it's all goo
[06:14] <maqr> *good
[06:14] <noiro> hey guys. Any idea how to make an .sh on an external harddrive executable?
[06:14] <excervo> hello guys, how do i disable unity on ubuntu 12.10?
[06:15] <noiro> When I try to make it executable, it unchecks the option again
[06:15] <devnull_> noiri ..chmod +x blash.sh
[06:15] <ezrafree> anyone know what i could try to look at to resolve this... my ubuntu box is stopping the bootup process after it says "checking battery state..."
[06:15] <maqr> noiro: what type of file system is it?
[06:15] <dr_willis> excervo:  install and use a different desktop is one way
[06:15] <devnull_> ezrafree, might be a apci  problem ? ... not sure about that though
[06:16] <devnull_> hendry .. i don't think so
[06:16] <noiro> maqr: it's a simple sh file. devnull: it doesn't work
[06:16] <ezrafree> devnull_: googling it pulls some ubuntu forums that seem to imply it might be a graphics driver problem but i have an intel card, so i don't think there's a way to reinstall the drivers (or rather, there are no drivers really)
[06:16] <devnull_> hendry ... gnome-control-center
[06:17] <maqr> noiro: i mean the file system of the disk, 'df' will show you
[06:17] <devnull_> noiri .... sudo chmod +x script.sh
[06:17] <noiro> maqr: ntsf
[06:17] <noiro> It's a shared partition between my linux and windows partition
[06:17] <dr_willis> you dont chmod stuff on ntfs or vfaat
[06:17] <devnull_> ezrafree, have you tried booting it in recovery or something ?
[06:17] <maqr> noiro: i think that's your problem, but i don't know what you're supposed to do about it :P
[06:17] <devnull_> noiro .. is it ntfs ?
[06:17] <dr_willis> sh foo.sh  or bash foo.sh
[06:17] <maqr> noiro: http://askubuntu.com/questions/11840/how-to-chmod-on-an-ntfs-or-fat32-partition related probably
[06:18] <ezrafree> where would be a good log file to look in?
[06:18] <dr_willis> or mount the whold fs executable
[06:18] <devnull_> ezrafree, dmesg
[06:18] <hendry> devnull_: what can't dash find these basic things?
[06:18] <noiro> I dont' really need any protection on the partition, I just want all access to it
[06:18] <ezrafree> devnull_: no, i haven't tried that yet. actually i don't know how to get into recovery mode but i will google it
[06:18] <ezrafree> devnill: thx ill check dmesg too
[06:18] <devnull_> hold LEFT SHIFT at boot
[06:18] <devnull_> will give you grub menu
[06:18] <dr_willis> its annoying when every file is executable on vfat/ntfs
[06:19] <devnull_> hendry,    open a terminal and type in gnome- control  and hit tab and see if it is listed
[06:19] <devnull_> hendry, sorry .... gnome-con  and hit tab
[06:20] <Mattheww> Any pro with kubuntu 12.10 atm?
[06:20] <devnull_> im on 12.10 ... don't know if the system settings is a different named app on 12.04
[06:20] <maqr> devnull_: is there a convenient way to prevent all 'linux-base' and 'linux-image-*' from updating? because this actually is going to drive me crazy :P
[06:20] <devnull_> maqr ... yes i believe there is .... i think it is called "masking"
[06:20] <maqr> hmm, i don't see any docs about it
[06:21] <devnull_> maqr .... Pinning maybe https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[06:21] <AlcariTheMad> now, i generally don't insult entire channels, but this is the least-helpful linux distribution channel i think i've ever been in
[06:21] <bazhang> dencrypt, maqr its pinning. not really something you want to do with kernels
[06:21] <bazhang> devnull_, ^
[06:21] <bazhang> sorry dencrypt
[06:21] <devnull_> maqr ... or "holding"
[06:21] <maqr> ah
[06:21] <bazhang> !pinning | maqr devnull_
[06:21] <ubottu> maqr devnull_: pinning is an advanced feature that APT can use to prefer particular packages over others. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PinningHowto
[06:22] <witeshark> http://askubuntu.com/questions/225655/webcam-doesnt-work-in-ubuntu-12-10
[06:22] <nextblove> #centos
[06:22] <maqr> ubottu: does it support wildcards?
[06:22] <ubottu> maqr: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[06:22] <maqr> oh, right
[06:22] <devnull_> maqr i think you want "holding" ... will hold it at current version
[06:22] <witeshark> is there a 12.10 web cam issue?
[06:22] <devnull_> witeshark ... depends on your cam and setup
[06:22] <maqr> devnull_: that's definitely what i want, but i'd have to make sure it's always linux-image-3.7.0-7-generic, i'd rather it supported a wildcard... i guess i can script it
[06:23] <devnull_> my built in one works fine in 12.10 ... but it is a new laptop
[06:23] <bazhang> devnull_, its pinning, not holding.
[06:23] <devnull_> maqr .. well if you aren't updating the linux-image ... it shouldn't have a need to get the other support packages for the kernel .. like headers
[06:23] <witeshark> devnull_, dell 1545
[06:23] <maqr> devnull_: oh, i'll try pinning just that one and see what happens then
[06:23] <devnull_> bazhang, the doc calls it Holding Packages
[06:24] <devnull_> pinning is more specific to the distro it seems
[06:24] <devnull_> holding locks the version of the software
[06:24] <devnull_> witeshark ... did you google "webcam problem in 12.10 dell 1545" ?
[06:24] <maqr> devnull_: it doesn't like me trying to hold linux-base, it's probably some meta/pseudo/whatever package
[06:25] <tobe_> hello
[06:25] <devnull_> witeshark, if you can find out what device that your webcam is .. is it internal? external ?
[06:25] <witeshark> devnull_, yes, now i have thanks
[06:25] <witeshark> night all
[06:25] <tobe_> i have a small annoying issue.  my mouse moves past my screen to the right. is there a way to fix this? plz help
[06:25] <devnull_> maqr ... that is possible ... i think bazhang  might know more about it ... im just reading the doc
[06:25] <sgo11> hi, I am using gnome3. installed indicator-cpufreq. how to enable it in gnome? when I execute the command "indicator-cpufreq". nothing happens. thanks.
[06:26] <devnull_> tobe_, turn off dual output
[06:26] <devnull_> sgo11, indicator-cpufreq-selector is the package you need for the notification area
[06:26] <tobe_> devnull_:  oh man... but i use an external screen because my laptop screen is cracked...
[06:26] <maqr> devnull_: you've got me going in the right direction, ty :)
[06:27] <devnull_> tobe_, go into display settings and make sure it is only using one of your screens
[06:27] <sgo11> devnull_, thanks a lot. I will install that one. does it mean indicator-cpufreq is for unity only?
[06:27] <devnull_> maqr ... no probe .. and thanks bazhang
[06:27] <devnull_> sgo11, no ... indicator-cpufreq is just like the backside of it i believe ... the actual indicator application is the -selector one .. i am in unity
[06:28] <nextblove> hello anyone can help me to format my flash drive please
[06:28] <devnull_> nextblove, format it to what ?
[06:28] <nextblove> in command line
[06:28] <bazhang> nextblove, use the disks application to do so
[06:28] <tobe_> devnull_:  wow i feel dumb now. i see the on off button everytime but its not really labeled... thanks
[06:28] <devnull_> nextblove, http://askubuntu.com/questions/22381/how-to-format-a-usb-flash-drive
[06:28] <nextblove> i said i want to format my flash drive in command line
[06:28] <devnull_> oh okay
[06:29] <sgo11> devnull_, with apt-cache search, I only can see "indicator-cpufreq". where is that selector package? if that is not in default repo, why does the default repo have indicator-cpufreq? weird.
[06:29] <devnull_> sgo11, let me check ... what version of ubuntu ?
[06:29] <sgo11> devnill, 12.04
[06:29] <Guest59790> My rhythm box stopped playing last.fm any idea
[06:29] <devnull_> nextblove, that link has a command line way of doing it
[06:30] <sgo11> devnull_, ubuntu 12.04
[06:30] <devnull_> ok
[06:31] <b3nj> hi need help
[06:31] <kaeza> back
=== KaiSforza is now known as ^KaiSforza
[06:31] <devnull_> sgo11, hehe ... let me remember how i got it
=== ^KaiSforza is now known as ```

=== ``` is now known as KaiSforza
[06:32] <Guest59790> By speed playing I mean none of the stations I make will play also I can go to the suite and the stations play just fine.
[06:32] <devnull_> sgo11, from the command line do ... indicator-cpufreq  and hit tab
[06:32] <kaeza> devnull_: I was able to start IceWM, but forgot to ask how to connect to internet from command line
[06:32] <OerHeks> !nomodeset | b3nj
[06:32] <ubottu> b3nj: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[06:32] <devnull_> kaeza, im glad you got in
[06:32] <devnull_> kaeza, wireless ?
[06:32] <kaeza> yes
[06:33] <sgo11> devnull_, yeah, that command is installed already... I got exception: dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.AccessDenied: Connection ":1.75" is not allowed
[06:33] <devnull_> you might want to see if icewm has a network manager app
[06:33] <devnull_> sgo11, is indicator-cpufreq-selector installed ?
[06:33] <b3nj> OerHeks
[06:34] <kaeza> devnull_: I looked all around the menus and found none
[06:34] <sgo11> devnull_, I just apt-get install indicator-cpufreq. indicator-cpufreq-selector is just a command.
[06:34] <devnull_> kaeza, how are you chatting right now ?
[06:34] <b3nj> OerHeks
[06:34] <kaeza> from Puppy Linux
[06:34] <devnull_> sgo11, did you just install it and haven't rebooted ?
[06:35] <Guest59790> Wow puppy Linux in the house.
[06:35] <devnull_> sgo11, try logging out and back in .. that app would not load for me till i had rebooted
[06:35] <sgo11> devnull_, that's correct. I thought linux world didn't require reboot. that is windows world thing.
[06:35] <kaeza> on Puppy I  use wvdial
[06:35] <devnull_> sgo11, not all the time
[06:35] <devnull_> sgo11, usually a login and out will do it ... force X to reload
[06:35] <OerHeks> b3nj, just ask
[06:35] <sgo11> devnull_, ok. ^_^ let me reboot... I have to reopen everything again. what a pity...
[06:36] <b3nj> OerHeks, in grub i chose advanced options and ubuntu booted normally
[06:37] <OerHeks> b3nj, what 'advanced option' ?
[06:37] <Guest59790> Any thought on rhythmbox not playing last.fm
[06:37] <devnull_> sgo11 .. just login and out first
[06:37] <devnull_> ah dang he left
[06:38] <devnull_> Guest59790, not at the moment
[06:39] <b3nj> OerHeks, grub does not show up again
[06:39] <Guest59790> devnull: okay thank you.
[06:39] <OerHeks> b3nj, there are no advanced options besides recovery , previous kernels and memtest
[06:40] <b3nj> OerHeks, advanced options for ubuntu
[06:41] <devnull_> Guest59790, what version of ubuntu ?
[06:41] <Guest59790> Devnull: 12.04 x64
[06:42] <b3nj> OerHeks, when i choose advanced options for ubuntu i see ubuntu, with linux 3.5.0-21-generic, same as previous (recovery mode), ubuntu with linux 3.5.0-17-generic and same as previous (recovery mode)
[06:43] <devnull_> Guest59790, try disabling the plugin .. closing rhythmbox ... reopen and reenable the plugin
[06:43] <Guest59790> That did not help.
[06:44] <sgo11> devnull_, first, indicator-cpufreq-selector still gives me that error. but I just realized indicator-cpufreq is running at the bottom-right bar in gnome3. then I installed indicator-multiload, it's running at bottom-right bar as well. that bar is hidden in gnome3. very weird. I don't know how to call that bar. task bar? what I want is some applets/indicator in the top-right bar. how to do that in gnome3? thanks.
[06:44] <b3nj> OerHeks, so when i choose ubuntu 3.5.0 generic it boots alright
=== HeKToN is now known as HeKToN|sleep
[06:45] <dr_willis> sgo11:  checked the gnome-shell extensions web site? it has many for the top bar
[06:45] <eos_> dr_willis: yes, gimp has always worked for me but after the last couple of updates it does not anymore .... I get a seg fault when I try to open or save any picture
[06:45] <devnull_> sgo11, i am using unity ... there is no bottom bar .. everything is in the upper right ... you have a "notification are" applet in your bottom panel ... if you remove it it might start using the correct spot .. if not try middle clicking on what you want and move it
[06:46] <sgo11> dr_willis, got it. let me see. thanks a lot. the two indicators are for unity only then.
[06:46] <tuxtoti> I created a new user this way : sudo useradd foo -m -s /bin/bash  . Also set the passwd : sudo passwd foo.
[06:46] <b3nj> OerHeks, so what do I do?
[06:47] <sgo11> devnull_, sure. I think I will remove the two indicators and check gnome3 extensions suggested by dr_willis. thanks.
[06:47] <tuxtoti> now if i do a : su foo  and enter the password, the base directory is not /home/foo.
[06:47] <dr_willis> tuxtoti:  adduser command may be easier to use
[06:47] <tuxtoti> though /home/foo still exists.
[06:47] <tuxtoti> dr_willis: ok.
[06:47] <ominomi> hmm..
[06:47] <dr_willis> ive never used useradd i ;)
[06:47] <devnull_> VPN in kubuntu 12.10 ... does that require openssl libraries for the certificate or should that lib be installed already ?
[06:48] <eos_> dr_willis: yet, if I run it as root, it works
[06:48] <WeThePeople> do i need to configure lampp before start?
[06:48] <devnull_> WeThePeople, before starting what
[06:48] <dr_willis> eos_:  try as a newly made user. if a new user works.. sounds like a app config issue
[06:49] <WeThePeople> devnull, lampp
[06:49] <WeThePeople> devnull_, lampp
[06:49] <devnull_> WeThePeople, no i mean ... before starting what ... lampp is just an acronym
[06:49] <dr_willis> eos_:  ive also seen where running stuff as root can cause  config files in the users home to get made/owned by root which can goof things up
[06:49] <eos_> dr_willis: here is the log of the crash when launching from konsole http://paste.ubuntu.com/1490817/
[06:50] <devnull_> WeThePeople, where did you install linux to ?
[06:50] <b3nj> help me, ubuntu does not boot showing black screen

[06:51] <Guest59790> B3nj: have you tried a previous version?

=== Teufelchen_ is now known as Teufelchen

[06:52] <WeThePeople> devnull_, no
[06:52] <WeThePeople> that what it is
[06:52] <b3nj> Guest59790: i do not know what it is but when in grub i choose advanced options for ubuntu it shows 3.5 kernel and when i choose it ubuntu boots normally
[06:52] <devnull_> do you mean LAMP or are you saying LAMPP
[06:53] <kslater> time to hit the sack. Thanks for the help and grins everyone.

[06:54] <Guest59790> B3nj have you some that and then checked for additional drivers for your video card?
[06:54] <WeThePeople> hence lampp

[06:57] <WeThePeople> devnull_, as i stated get lampp to show up in the browser
[06:57] <devnull_> WeThePeople, STOP saying LAMPP
[06:57] <kylescottmcgill> lol
[06:57] <Xabster> you mean apache2's default page, WeThePeople?
[06:57] <WeThePeople> lampp is running and is returning a error not found in chrome
[06:57] <Guest59790> B3nj: you said that of you select advanced options it works correct? If so once in find the application that searches for additional drivers and see if there is one for your graphics card.
[06:58] <kylescottmcgill> WeThePeople: please paste the link to the package you are using
[06:58] <Xabster> WeThePeople: lamp can't run; it's not a program
[06:58] <eos_> dr_willis: what do you think?

[06:58] <devnull_> WeThePeople, why don't you just install apache, mysql, php like everyone else does
[06:59] <jCuber> ben_: I can't remember how to do it, but you could try restarting your audio service (pulseaudio, i presume)

[07:00] <devnull_> and what is the extra P for ?
[07:00] <ben_> jcuber, can you explain how I'd go about that please? I'm very poor in a terminal still.
[07:00] <kylescottmcgill> devnull_: Perl
[07:00] <kylescottmcgill> or Python
[07:00] <devnull_> ahh
[07:00] <devnull_> yea ... definately just install apache2 the normal way
[07:00] <Xabster> kylescottmcgill: i'm new to linux - after that command, how to start the webserver daemon?
[07:00] <kylescottmcgill> Apache will automatically start
[07:00] <devnull_> if you need a control center there has to be one out there
[07:00] <kylescottmcgill> once you have installed all of the above
[07:01] <Xabster> as a auto-start service on boot?
[07:01] <Xabster> mkay
[07:01] <kylescottmcgill> type into your browser 127.0.0.1
[07:01] <devnull_> Xabster, apache2 should autostart if you have it installed
[07:01] <WeThePeople> devnull_, here is the output>>> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1490840/
[07:01] <Guest59790> B3nj: have you tried my suggestion yet?
[07:01] <jCuber> ben_: I can't remember myself. Hey folks, how does one restart pulseaudio service?
[07:01] <WeThePeople> devnull_, localhost says error not found
[07:01] <Ailos> is there a way to open the Additional Hardware Drivers dialog from command line?
[07:01] <b3nj> Guest59790: to find driver?
[07:01] <devnull_> WeThePeople, you already have those services running
[07:02] <WeThePeople> devnull_, yes
[07:02] <devnull_> WeThePeople, STOP with the lampp stuff
[07:02] <WeThePeople> made you say it
[07:02] <WeThePeople> lol
[07:02] <Ben64> WeThePeople: why are you installing/running things that way? use the normal ubuntu way
[07:02] <Guest59790> B3nj: yes
[07:02] <WeThePeople> ben64, idk the norm
[07:02] <devnull_> WeThePeople, hehe
[07:02] <Ben64> WeThePeople: use the software center
[07:02] <b3nj> Guest59790: but if i boot with advanced options it works well, so why do you think this is a driver problem
[07:03] <kylescottmcgill> WeThePeople: we are trying to help you with the norm... lol Software Center isnt the norm when your install development packages :D
[07:03] <devnull_> WeThePeople, ubuntu has many docs on getting a "AMP" setup
[07:03] <eos_> dr_willis: yet, I do not undertsand what is wrong with the other users configuration .... I would need all users to be allowed to use it.
[07:03] <Ben64> !lamp
[07:03] <ubottu> LAMP is an acronym for Linux-Apache-MySQL-PHP. However, the term is often used for setups using alternative but different software, such as Perl or Python instead of PHP, and Postgres instead of MySQL. For help with setting up LAMP on Ubuntu, see  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP - See also the Server CD installation process.
[07:03] <dulio> why not tasksel?
[07:03] <dulio> tasksel to select LAMP server
[07:04] <devnull_> WeThePeople, im not trying to be hard on you ... im just trying to get you to understand that you probably should be doing this through the traditional ubuntu channel .. not outside sources
[07:04] <Ben64> dulio: thats what the !lamp links to
[07:04] <dulio> Ben64: :)
[07:04] <kylescottmcgill> dulio: you could do that too, ive been a web developer for a long time, so i remember all this stuff, plus i like to configure it my way
[07:05] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, i hear ya
[07:05] <Xabster> Hi, I just googled to see if i could find a list of supported hardware - anyone got a link cause my results are way off
[07:05] <Transhumanist> apt-get is the norm often even when you're not installing development packages
[07:05] <Transhumanist> it's much faster
[07:05] <devnull_> Xabster, supported hardware for what ?
[07:05] <Transhumanist> and recommends the correct package when you get its name wrong
[07:05] <dulio> kylescottmcgill: yea, me,too. but i installed first time by tasksel --!
[07:05] <Muphrid> Xabster: have you seen https://friendly.ubuntu.com/
[07:05] <devnull_> WeThePeople, i would uninstall your XAMPP/LAMPP  package of software
[07:05] <kylescottmcgill> dulio: yeah fair point
[07:06] <Xabster> devnull_: i'm considering replacing windows 7 on my home desktop with ubuntu 12.10 - i had problems in windows 7 with my quite new motherboards (network and sound didn't work)
[07:06] <Xabster> i want to prepare for problems before i do anything
[07:06] <devnull_> Xabster, grab a LIVE CD .. i mean DVD now ... and either put it on a DVD or usb drive and boot into it
[07:06] <dulio> kylescottmcgill: But I am not good at advanced options just like change mysql params.
[07:06] <Xabster> right, installing makes no difference for drivers then i take it
[07:06] <devnull_> Xabster, if things work .. i would say ubuntu supports your hardware .. though if you go through ubuntus docs they do have pages and pages about hardware compatibility
[07:07] <dulio> kylescottmcgill: You may help me somehow :)
[07:07] <Xabster> i see, but i very much doubt it works, so i would have to try some drivers
[07:07] <Ben64> Xabster: installing ubuntu makes it run faster, and you get better graphics drivers as well
[07:07] <Xabster> Ben64, assuming there are drivers for my ATI card :)
[07:07] <kylescottmcgill> dulio: defaults are normally pretty good, but with single application servers, you can tweak it to work more for you, and sift out cruft you dont need/want
[07:07] <devnull_> Xabster, try the live cd
[07:07] <Ben64> Xabster: there is a very high chance ubuntu will "just work"
[07:07] <dr_willis> eos_:  i would check the config files and ownerships of the problem user
[07:08] <kylescottmcgill> dulio: im always willing to lend a helping hand :)
[07:08] <devnull_> Xabster, it is possible you may be missing some features .. but i would bet 90+ of your hardware will be supported out of the box
[07:08] <anth0ny> When I run 'users' in terminal, I see 'anthony' twice. When I run 'uptime', I see '2 users'.  Why would this be?
[07:08] <eos_> dr_willis: which configuration file? I tried deleting .gimp on the users home dir but did not work .... any other relevant configuration files?
[07:08] <Ben64> anth0ny: every instance of a login adds another
[07:08] <kylescottmcgill> anth0ny: are you logged in twice?
[07:08] <kylescottmcgill> in different TTY's?
[07:09] <anth0ny> kylescottmcgill: it would appear that I am logged in.  I don't kow how/why
[07:09] <dr_willis> eos_:  no idea. im not on a ubuntu box to look. and havent used gimp in months
[07:09] <dulio> kylescottmcgill: thx, I will learn more here.
[07:09] <kylescottmcgill> anth0ny: run w in the terminal
[07:09] <anth0ny> Ben64: the real quesiton is, why are there two instances of login?
[07:09] <dr_willis> eos_:  look for stuff owned by root for starters
[07:09] <kylescottmcgill> it will tell you where are you logged in
[07:09] <Ben64> anth0ny: open another terminal and try again
[07:09] <eos_> dr_willis: could not find anything really
[07:09] <dr_willis> bbl
[07:09] <eos_> dr_willis: thanks a lot!
[07:10] <anth0ny> kylescottmcgill: http://pastie.org/5614532
[07:10] <anth0ny> kylescottmcgill: so, looks like Ubuntu is a user and then the terminal is another?
[07:10] <anth0ny> Ben64: ^
[07:10] <kylescottmcgill> anth0ny: i wouldnt worry about that, your Terminal has just 'logged you in'
[07:11] <kylescottmcgill> TTY7 is GUI, everything is more or less encapsulated into TTY7
[07:11] <kylescottmcgill> anth0ny: ya
[07:12] <anth0ny> The real issue is that Ubunut12.04 seems to be running really slowly. I used to run Mint and before that, Ubuntu 11.04 and they ran so much faster. Trying to figure out what's causing the major delay that occurs when the system starts up and to open applicaitons
[07:13] <devnull_> anth0ny,   Unity
[07:13] <kylescottmcgill> anth0ny: yeah try booting into Classic mode (i dont know if this enable by default)
[07:13] <devnull_> anth0ny, i had to tweak unity a lot on my old laptop to get decent speed ... and minesweeper was laggy as all heck
[07:13] <anth0ny> devnull_: what, is unity known for being really slow?
[07:13] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, i think it needs to be downloaded
[07:13] <anth0ny> ugh
[07:14] <anth0ny> what a bummer
[07:14] <devnull_> anth0ny, not particularly ... but it is a 3d desktop .. and the side-scroll bars can cause latency issues ... it is new toolkits
[07:14] <Ben64> anth0ny: what graphics card do  you have
[07:14] <kylescottmcgill> devnull_: ohk, i install Gnome3, and it appears, so i wasnt sure if it came with Gnome3 or it just enabled it as a fallback
[07:14] <devnull_> might need better graphic drivers
[07:14] <devnull_> i think you have to get it seperate ... gnome-classic ?
[07:14] <devnull_> or you can get cinnamon
[07:15] <devnull_> or some other fork of gnome2 even
[07:15] <Ben64> Ubuntu 2D might have better performance
[07:15] <Ben64> cinnamon is not supported here
[07:15] <kylescottmcgill> i use awesome wm :D its awesome....
[07:15] <devnull_> gotcha
[07:15] <anth0ny> Ben64: DIAMOND Radeon HD 4870 512MB 256-bit GDDR5	
[07:15] <kylescottmcgill> anth0ny: that should be sweet as
[07:15] <Ben64> anth0ny: do you have the proprietary drivers for it?
[07:15] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, i used WM for years until sawfish came out
[07:15] <kylescottmcgill> hmm i will have a look
[07:15] <kylescottmcgill> oh the movie :D
[07:16] <anth0ny> Ben64 - i believe so. it should be mentioned that when it was running fast, it was without that card
[07:16] <devnull_> sawfish was the Window Manager for gnome ... then it was called meta-city i think
[07:16] <devnull_> in the past that is
[07:16] <devnull_> anth0ny, you might need the ATI proprietary drivers ... or see if you are running the radeon open source one ... it worked for me on my old laptop
[07:16] <kylescottmcgill> oh i see, yeah i like my Tiling Window Managers, i enjoy Gnome3 as well, but i feel more productive in Awesome
[07:16] <devnull_> unfortunately i am using the ATI fglrx prop. drivers on my new laptop
[07:17] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, i felt the same way ... Window Maker was awesome .. it still is ... i just feel that gnome stepped it up and has a good feature set and doesn't take up to much realestate anymore
[07:17] <anth0ny> brb
[07:17] <kylescottmcgill> ya fair enough
[07:18] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, though when unity came out i was tempted to go back to WM for a bit :)

[07:19] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, i loved all the docked applets ... it was so sweet ...   to bad Enlightenment still hasn't made it mainstream yet
[07:19] <WeThePeople> what is a webserver for precise?
[07:19] <somsip> devnull_: Enlightment is now 1.0
[07:19] <devnull_> WeThePeople, Apache2
[07:20] <kylescottmcgill> Yeah, a lot of people seem to look down on it, because it requires a fari amount of attention prior to it working the way people expect, idk meh
[07:20] <devnull_> somsip, i saw the E17 thing as its own distro
[07:20] <kylescottmcgill> WeThePeople: sudo service apache2 status/reload/restart/stop/start are your friends if you have made any config changes
[07:21] <kylescottmcgill> /var/www is your default Web Directory
[07:21] <kylescottmcgill> 127.0.0.1 will navigate to that directory
[07:21] <somsip> devnull_: you mean Elementary? Enlightment is a wm (and stuff) AFAICT. Still, I'm on awesome too so makes no difference to me
[07:21] <dr_willis> enlightment has slowly grown into a desktop. but i find it.. lacking. ;)
[07:22] <devnull_> somsip, yea something like that ... havne't kept up on it in awhile ... since compiz i haven't seen a need for the effects of enlightenment
[07:22] <somsip> devnull_: agreed, and must get back to work and on topic...
[07:22] <devnull_> somsip, i hear ya ... i am procrastinating
[07:23] <devnull_> time to make the phps do that thing they do
[07:23] <kylescottmcgill> ya imma brb good luck WeThePeople
[07:23] <WeThePeople> thanks
[07:23] <eos_> dr_willis: even with the new user, if I log in I have the same problem .... it crashes again
[07:24] <dr_willis> eos_:  that is weird.  you are using gimp from the default repos?
[07:24] <eos_> dr_willis: yes
[07:24] <devnull_> anyone have any idea on how to get my quad speakers plus subwoofer to work in 12.10 ?  i have no subwoofer and only 2 channels
[07:25] <eos_> dr_willis: did you see the log file I posted by any chance? I cannot make sense of it
[07:25] <hackinblack> Sooo Is ubuntu mobile going to be able to be installed on existing phones say if there unlocked rooted etc. On android?
[07:25] <dr_willis> eos_:  it ment very little to me.. warnings then a segfault
[07:25] <dr_willis> hackinblack:  we dont know
[07:25] <devnull_> hackinblack, i haven't read anything ... but i would imagine it is being targetted at newer devices
[07:25] <eos_> dr_willis: what is the best way to debug?
[07:26] <dr_willis> theres no real details out about it hackinblack
[07:26] <devnull_> i guess people forget there was linux based phones over 12 years ago
[07:26] <dr_willis> eos_:  theres debugging/strace tools  but ive never used them
[07:26] <hackinblack> Well that sucks I just saw the video :(
[07:26] <devnull_> hackinblack, yea im excited to ... we will have to wait :(
[07:26] <dr_willis> hackinblack:  and it may be a year+ befor you get your hands on one
[07:27] <hackinblack> Devnull 12 years ago I was playing with toys lol
[07:27] <devnull_> hackinblack, haha ... your the second person to say that today
[07:27] <devnull_> someone called me old because i have been using linux since 98 and that was when they were born
[07:28] <maqr> devnull_: we are old
[07:28] <dr_willis> get off my lawn!
[07:28] <dr_willis> ;)
[07:28] <maqr> yeah!
[07:28] <hackinblack> Lol dev
[07:28] <Xabster> devnull_: to 14 year olds everyone with pubes are old

[07:29] <hackinblack> I'm 19 wasn't much into technology 12 years ago
[07:29] <dr_willis> these days 6 yr olfs got their own cellphones
[07:29] <Ben64> ubuntu phone :|
[07:29] <dr_willis> and 100000 friends on facebook
[07:30] <hackinblack> It's insane
[07:30] <Ben64> but i like android...
[07:30] <kion> Droid rocks
[07:30] <maqr> android is pretty sweet, i'm not sure what the deal with ubuntu phone is
[07:30] <devnull_> well your lucky you are coming to linux now ... it is a lot easier now than back then
[07:30] <dr_willis> ive seen so much hype and vaporware  - so i will wait and see...
[07:30] <maqr> kion: *cringe* don't use the motorola branding :(
[07:30] <devnull_> i remember waiting for usb support in the kernel
[07:30] <hackinblack> Yea android is the best in my opinion but I'm excited for ubuntu
[07:30] <eos_> dr_willis: thanks a lot, have to go!
[07:30] <Ben64> i don't see the point of ubuntu phone
[07:31] <dr_willis> people dident see the point in smartphonnnes a few years back
[07:31] <hackinblack> ^
[07:31] <Ben64> but we all already have smart phones
[07:32] <Ben64> and we chose either android or apple, and we have apps and everything for whichever platform
[07:32] <devnull_> Ben64, i wouldn't mind giving ubuntu a try on a phone
[07:32] <hackinblack> I'm on my smartphone right now lol using android irc
[07:32] <devnull_> your forgetting about blackberry ... which is dying
[07:32] <dr_willis> and  no longer need other devices like mp3 players and tomtoms...   ubuntu phone could eliminate your laptop.
[07:32] <Ben64> my phone already eliminated my laptop
[07:32] <wachpwnski> Is there any reason ZFS-FUSE is spawned as a process many times on my box?

[07:35] <kion> dr_willis: Can it be used to spy on people? Should I uninstall it?
[07:35] <dr_willis> kion:  should be online guides about it.
[07:35] <dr_willis> its handy in some cases
[07:37] <nipar> Can anyone recommend a nice way of running a windows VM inside ubuntu, so I can make a switch of OS and still have the few vital windows services running?
[07:37] <dr_willis> 'switch of os' meaning?
[07:37] <nipar> I want to be on ubuntu at all times
[07:37] <dr_willis> you  can run windows in vbox.
[07:38] <nipar> but I have a few vital windows services I need, that keeps me from it
[07:38] <dr_willis> some apps may not run well. depending on the app
[07:38] <nipar> Would this drag performance down a lot, if I had windows running in a vbox literally 24/7?
[07:38] <dr_willis> depends on what its doing
[07:38] <hackinblack> Depends
[07:38] <dr_willis> and your specs
[07:39] <nipar> only one way to find out I guess
[07:40] <nipar> booting over to ubuntu, hopefully for the last time :l
[07:41] <dulio> how to ignore login/logout info here?
[07:41] <somsip> dulio: depends on your client
[07:41] <dulio> somsip: This is irssi
[07:42] <hackinblack> Check settings

[07:44] <kelvinella> hi how to get weather applet to work?
[07:44] <kelvinella> i did this : sudo apt-get install indicator-weather
[07:44] <kelvinella> but still no weather applet in 12.04
[07:45] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, yea i have gone through all of that ... there is my hdmi out with nothing and my card with the standard mixers .. master, mic, pcm etc ..
[07:45] <dr_willis> say a neat alternative weather applet thing on the omgubuntu sites top 10 apps for 2012 list
[07:45] <devnull_> i can virtually bump it to 6 channels ... but still no sub
[07:45] <kion> kelvinella: did sudo apt-get install indicator-weather work?
[07:45] <kylescottmcgill> devnull_: lame, i dont have surround, so im not sure sorry
[07:45] <dulio> it seems work. ^.^
[07:46] <devnull_> kylescottmcgill, well surround or not .. i would deal with just 3 channels ... f-left, f-right and lfe through sub would be nice
[07:46] <kelvinella> i mean i run sudo apt-get install indicator-weather it installs but how to add applet in 12.04??
[07:46] <kelvinella> cant right click on panel and add??
[07:47] <devnull_> kelvinella, try launching it from dash
[07:47] <devnull_> that status area has a new system for having apps on it

[07:47] <kion> I upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 and now my google earth is gone!!! can someone tell me why???
[07:47] <kelvinella> devnill, launch what?
[07:48] <kelvinella> devnull_, launch what? how?
[07:48] <AndroUser2> Kino why did u update ?
[07:48] <devnull_> kelvinella, from the dash .... you using unity ?
[07:49] <kelvinella> devnull_, oic

[07:52] <kelvinella> should i pick google or yahoo weather?
[07:52] <kelvinella> i did that in dash
[07:52] <devnull_> idk
[07:52] <devnull_> do it from the term so you can see the output
[07:52] <kelvinella> wait
[07:53] <kelvinella> how to run applet in terminal?
[07:53] <devnull_> indicator-weather
[07:53] <devnull_> just type the command and hit enter

[07:54] <devnull_> kelvinella, is the location code supposed to be in weather format ?
[07:55] <kelvinella> ?
[07:55] <devnull_> like in code
[07:55] <devnull_> you have to find out the code for the location you want
[07:55] <ikla_> is ubuntu hard to install
[07:55] <devnull_> ikla_, no
[07:55] <ikla_> I'm thinking about trying it out
[07:55] <ihackeverything> UK no
[07:55] <kion> ikla_ very simple
[07:55] <devnull_> ikla_, less clicks than windows i believe
[07:55] <ihackeverything> Yea also dual booting
[07:55] <kion> ikla_ linux is the best OS, and Ubuntu is a great linux distro
[07:55] <ikla_> why is it the best
[07:56] <kion> ikla_ highly recommended
[07:56] <devnull_> kelvinella, they use a number format i believe to identify locations
[07:56] <kelvinella> so it doesnt work?
[07:56] <ikla_> hmm
[07:56] <ikla_> do I download the iso image
[07:56] <ikla_> can it fit on cdr?
[07:57] <kion> ikla_ because it allows me to controll my hardware exactly as I want and because of the huge amounts of software there is , not to mention the security etc?. I could go on and on..
[07:57] <devnull_> how do you pick your location for the weather app ? did you just type in a city and state or something ?
[07:57] <devnull_> because that isn't how it works
[07:57] <kion> Ikla_: yes download your iso image burn it into a disk or usb and boot from there
[07:57] <devnull_> but i can not say if it will work after putting the correct code in ... it might not work at all either way
[07:58] <devnull_> ikla_, has to be a CD with atleast 750mb of space ... i suggest usb or dvd
[07:58] <devnull_> ubuntu has ditched trying to keep the images small enough to fit on most cds
[08:01] <mohi666> I'm trying to install a media center server on my Linux box to stream 1080P videos to my Google TV box. Any idea what server I should install?
[08:01] <devnull_> myth ?
[08:02] <ikonia> mohi666: it depends what your google TV box needs as a client
[08:02] <HackinBlack> FloodBot1
[08:02] <ikonia> mohi666: I'd approach it from that viewpoint
[08:02] <HackinBlack> FloodBot1
[08:02] <mohi666> ikonia, I know there's an app that supports DLNA out of the box
[08:03] <mohi666> however, I may end up having videos in different format. I'm not too sure if it can play all of them
[08:03] <devnull_> dlna might work
[08:03] <ikonia> mohi666: there are many, hence why it I'd check what your client needs
[08:03] <devnull_> are you pushing to the googletv box or pulling
[08:04] <mohi666> devnill, I have all the movies stored in my linux server
[08:04] <mohi666> devnill, that's why I'm trying to push them to google tv box
[08:04] <devnull_> so to googletv does it see your computer as like a mass storage or something ?
[08:05] <Xabster> the image i have is ~770 MB - is there a DVD image with additional drivers and stuff?
[08:05] <Xabster> for a live cd
[08:05] <Xabster> /dvd
[08:05] <mohi666> devnill, I haven't installed any file server or DLNA on my linux box, yet. That's why google tv cannot see anything yet
[08:06] <devnull_> so maybe streaming isn't the correct term
[08:07] <saleh> hi
[08:08] <HackinBlack> (saleh) hi
[08:09] <saleh> can you help me ?
[08:09] <HackinBlack> Ask Ur question
[08:09] <devnull_> idk
[08:09] <devnull_> mohi666, plex ??
[08:10] <krofna> I have a problem... I tried to install fglrx drivers, and since they didn't work well, I wanted to revert back to xorg open source drivers, but after removing fglrx I am stuck on login screen (After login it puts me back on login screen), I replaced lightdm with gdm and it (kind of) fixed the issue, but after login I get bunch of system errors (compiz and x crash). WHat should I do?
[08:10] <mohi666> devnill, I forgot to mention that I may try to access the content on my tablet as well.
[08:10] <devnull_> mohi666, plex looks promising and there is an app for ios/android and apps for most tv boxes including googletv
[08:11] <saleh> i have problem with nvidia geforce gt 540 m -
[08:11] <saleh> i a have problem with nvidia geforce gt 540 m -
[08:11] <devnull_> krofna, reinstall fglrx
[08:11] <mohi666> devnill, plex is not in official Arch Linux repository :( I try to avoid those packages
[08:11] <Transhumanist> Same
[08:11] <krofna> devnull_ Why? fglrx seem to perform horribly and buggy
[08:12] <Transhumanist> And when I did install Plex, it was kind of shit. Seemed very proprietary.
[08:12] <devnull_> krofna, because you will get back to your desktop ... then you can revert the correct way
[08:12] <fwp2k> do you choice sailfishos or ubuntu
[08:12] <devnull_> why do you care about arch linux repo
[08:12] <Transhumanist> Plex isn't in Ubuntu's repos either
[08:13] <Transhumanist> you have to add its repo manually
[08:13] <Transhumanist> I don't trust it, its direction, or the authors
[08:13] <mohi666> devnill, Because plex is in Arch User Repository. I have to manually maintain it, if I install it from there
[08:13] <Transhumanist> He's talking about the fact that this is #ubuntu I think :)
[08:13] <devnull_> they have the debs right on their site
[08:14] <mohi666> Transfusion, true, but Linux is Linux.
[08:14] <devnull_> Transhumanist, yes
[08:14] <Transhumanist> agreed - I don't care :)
[08:14] <devnull_> because at first it sounded like you were asking in the wrong channel when you said arch linux
[08:14] <mohi666> I rather install software that is in my OS official repo
[08:14] <devnull_> as would i
[08:15] <devnull_> but if options are limited it is what it is
[08:15] <blueoil22> ciao
[08:15] <Transhumanist> Anyway, it might be worth considering xbmc for an alternative to Plex.
[08:16] <devnull_> whats xbmc
[08:16] <mohi666> Yeah, I'm going to give a try to xbmc
[08:17] <donnie_> I forgot the terminal command to find out what version of linux I'm using
[08:17] <Transhumanist> devnull: xbmc originally stood for "Xbox Media Centre". It has since become completely cross-platform and is fully open source. Now it has little to do with XBox. But it's in the Ubuntu repos and is recommended for media management by a lot of people
[08:17] <Transhumanist> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XBMC
[08:18] <devnull_> uname -a
[08:18] <devnull_> Transhumanist, cool
[08:18] <devnull_> im thinking about getting a roku box
[08:18] <donnie_> I need to one for finding out what ubuntu I'm running, 10, 11,... I do forget that
[08:19] <HackinBlack> You can don't need terminal to see what version u have to go too settings
[08:19] <Transhumanist> I've just set up an old laptop as a server (low energy consumption). Set up smb sharing on it, installed XBMC, plugged into TV, turned laptop's monitor off.
[08:19] <Transhumanist> Also installed Deluge so other computers can get the laptop to do torrents via the web client
[08:20] <Tex_Nick> donnie : lsb_release -a
[08:20] <devnull_> nice one tex
[08:23] <techouse> is there a way i could xzip a file over ssh from the server to my local machine without making an xz file first on the server?
[08:23] <biopyte> hi, i'm using gnome classic + compiz on ubuntu 12.04.  is there a way navigating through the desktop wall just by touching the edges with mouse? right now i can switch workspaces only using keys or the workspace switcher in the status bar. edge flipping on mouse contact would be very helpful.
[08:23] <techouse> sort of "pipe" it via xzip to my machine
[08:24] <dulio> biopyte, yea, I like classic too
[08:25] <dulio> biopyte, I like edge flipping
[08:25] <devnull_> biopyte, yes it is in compiz
[08:25] <devnull_> or in a tweaks program
[08:25] <devnull_> do you have compiz settings manager
[08:25] <biopyte> yes,
[08:25] <biopyte> but which setting?
[08:26] <devnull_> biopyte, find desktop wall .. bindings
[08:26] <dulio> devnull_, the feature comes from compiz?
=== Ronald_ is now known as Ronald
[08:26] <biopyte> ok ... and then?
[08:26] <Tex_Nick> techouse : would something like this work ... tar -cvf files | (cd target_directory ; tar -xpf)
[08:27] <devnull_> desktop wall -> bindings
[08:27] <devnull_> im on 12.10 so i have a crippled compiz config manager
[08:27] <biopyte> devnull, got it ... then change what setting?
[08:27] <devnull_> well go to the edge flipping tab first .. and activate what you want
[08:27] <biopyte> i tried several before already
[08:28] <devnull_> let me reread your question .. hold on
[08:28] <biopyte> devnull, that doesnt make flipping on mouse touch
[08:29] <devnull_> its supposed to
[08:29] <devnull_> try looking for ubuntu tweak or something like that
[08:29] <biopyte> ok, thx
[08:29] <devnull_> try the viewport switcher in compiz
[08:30] <devnull_> viewport switcher -> desktopbased viewport switching
[08:31] <devnull_> i have mine to scroll through desktop but they have the option for using edges of the screen .. you can go left right up and down
[08:31] <HackinBlack> Ubuntu tweak
[08:32] <devnull_> hackinblack knows where its at
[08:33] <devnull_> though in 12.10 there is a lot missing in compiz settings manager
[08:33] <techouse> Tex_Nick, yea if it were local, but dunno if i can put ssh remote location into the pipe
[08:33] <Xabster> "Want to download via BitTorrent links, get DVD images with more language packs, use the text-based alternate installer or find previous versions of Ubuntu?"
[08:33] <Xabster> those DVD sized images are nowhere to be found
[08:34] <dr_willis> Xabster: what release?
[08:34] <nipar> Anyone up for helping me getting USB to work on virtualbox?
[08:34] <Xabster> 12.10
[08:34] <Xabster> desktop
[08:34] <Tex_Nick> devnull : sudo apt-get install compiz-plugins
[08:34] <dr_willis> 12.10 is only on a dvs
[08:34] <dr_willis> dvd
[08:34] <devnull_> Tex_Nick, thanks
[08:35] <devnull_> i forgot i had done that on my old machine
[08:35] <devnull_> Tex_Nick, much better now :) :)
[08:35] <dr_willis> 12.10 no longer has the alt installer disk either
[08:35] <Tex_Nick> techouse : how about this ... tar -cvf files | ssh remote_host (cd target_directory ; tar -xpf)
[08:36] <blueoil22> ciao
[08:36] <Motoservo> Ugh. I need linux on my Mac for an old scanner I need to run. After four days of trying to install Ubuntu I've mostly got it up save for two last issues. I can only boot through Recovery Mode, when I boot right into Linux I end up with a purple screen with some off video streaks. But after Recovery mode it will make it to the GUI just fine. Any tips on what's going on?
[08:36] <HackinBlack> Huh mac
[08:36] <techouse> virtualbox?
[08:36] <techouse> vmware?
[08:36] <Tex_Nick> devnull : you're welcome
[08:36] <techouse> why not those :P
[08:36] <Motoservo> No virtual box.
[08:37] <Motoservo> just installed it onto an external drive.
[08:37] <devnull_> Motoservo, sounds like the graphics weren't set right in the kernel boot options possibly
[08:37] <techouse> lol
[08:37] <nipar> on 12.10, I have added my username to the usergroup vboxusers - this supposively should enable me to mount USB in virtualbox. However, vbox returns error and persists I should enable my username in the vboxusers group. Anyone got a clue of whats not working as intended?
[08:37] <HackinBlack> Ur first problem is its on a mac
[08:38] <Xabster> dr_willis, but where are the larger images with more languages and stuff?
[08:38] <kion> yes macs suck
[08:38] <kion> unfortunately I have one
[08:38] <Motoservo> Any idea how I can fix that, devnull_?
[08:38] <dr_willis> Xabster:  no idea
[08:38] <elfer> i dont like macs
[08:38] <HackinBlack> U should always build Ur own
[08:38] <Motoservo> Well, I can't disagree more, Kion. Four days trying to install an OS is my idea of suck.
[08:39] <devnull_> you can try adjusting gfxmode in grub.cfg
[08:39] <Eagleman> Where can i find a copy of the default file in /etc/apache2/sites-avaible  ?
[08:39] <Motoservo> I didn't come here for a bunch Mac bashing. But I suppose that's what the Linux community has to offer.
[08:40] <devnull_> get it to just do text instead of framebuffer
[08:40] <dr_willis> recovery mode works fine?
[08:40] <devnull_> yes
[08:40] <Motoservo> Yes, it works.
[08:40] <biopyte> devnull, i changed desktop-based-viewport-switching-mouse-left to <left edge> button1. still no switching on pointer contact.
[08:40] <dr_willis> recovery uses nomodeset i think
[08:41] <dr_willis> and tuens off  the fremabufffer
[08:41] <HackinBlack> I'm sure you can always go to a mac irc and have them help you
[08:41] <dr_willis> turns
[08:41] <devnull_> why would you set it like that
[08:41] <devnull_> button1 requires a click
[08:41] <devnull_> just use the edge
[08:41] <dr_willis> !nomodeset
[08:41] <ubottu> A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[08:41] <devnull_> thanks dr_willis that is what i was reaching for
[08:41] <Motoservo> How can I set that on the regular boot, dr_willis?
[08:42] <devnull_> Eagleman, get it from the package
[08:42] <nearst> Motoservo, /etc/default/grub then sudo update-grub
[08:42] <Eagleman> devnull_, i always forget i have rsnapshot running, sorry
[08:42] <dr_willis> Motoservo:  if its using grub.. see above
[08:42] <biopyte> devnull, button1 is default, alternatives are button 2 - 20,  no other option besides button x
[08:42] <Motoservo> thanks, nearst
[08:42] <Motoservo> Yes, using grub.
[08:43] <biopyte> devnull, even clicking doesnt work, anyway
[08:44] <devnull_> biopyte, i see ... disable that binding for now
[08:44] <biopyte> devnull, ok
[08:45] <devnull_> ill see if i can find one that just uses edges
[08:45] <biopyte> alright
[08:46] <biopyte> alternativly, i could install brightside, but that conflicts with compiz
[08:46] <devnull_> desktop wall looks like the only other spot

[08:49] <nearst> 0,0
[08:50] <non-> anyone know a little about bzip2
[08:50] <nearst> why?
[08:50] <biopyte> devnull, what do you mean 'ubuntu tweak'? i cant find such a package.
[08:50] <nrosvall> I'm a long time Windows developer and I'm just about to start developing an application for Ubuntu. Now with this new Ubuntu Phone and coming Ubuntu sdk. Is it still recommened to use gtk and python as mentioned in developer.ubuntu.com? Or should I go for c++ and qt? Or is it just too early to think about the phone?
[08:51] <HackinBlack> Ich liebe dich
[08:51] <OerHeks> non-, ask your real question and find out
[08:51] <nearst> !ubuntu-tweak
[08:51] <dr_willis> biopyte:  find the ubuntu-tweak homepage
[08:51] <devnull_> there is gtk++
[08:51] <biopyte> dr_willis, ok
[08:51] <HackinBlack> http://ubuntu-tweak.com/
[08:51] <angryWolf> Maybe it will work in english too. I have a problem with "dvdauthor"  <ERR:  no video format specified for VMGM> I Use KDE Plattform-Version 4.8.5 (4.8.5) on a Linux 3.2.0-35-generic x86_64
[08:51] <non-> haha ok thanks <Derheks> So I had a problem updating Ubuntu 12.04 LTS - I'm trying to download the Android SDK bundle
[08:51] <nearst> python rules
[08:52] <non-> I need to replace the bzip2 file in /usr/lib/apt/methods
[08:52] <HackinBlack> Biopyte
[08:52] <nrosvall> python rules yes, but it seems that the phone will support qt5 and qml, nothing said about python
[08:53] <biopyte> got it, its not in the standard repositories
[08:53] <non-> so I downloaded the tar.gz and moved it into the /usr/lib/apt/methods folder (after deleting bzip2) but do not know which file to put back in, there is an entire directory there... <DerHeks>
[08:54] <abrigan> hello. what channel about programming X11 graphical?
[08:54] <blueoil22> ciao
[08:54] <OerHeks> non-, i don't understand why you need to replace bzip2, what manual/howto are you using ?
[08:54]  * dr_willis ducks the !list
[08:55] <non-> <DerHeks> Bzip2 was unexpectedly dying - stopped me from updating
[08:56] <laze1989> As they are using QML/Qt and C++ in the native application devkit for Ubuntu Phone, is Ubuntu moving towards QML/Qt for the desktop, too? I know there is a point about a Ubuntu Devkit for the Desktop for 13.04.
[08:56] <alimj> angryWolf: It has been a long time since last time I used dvdauthor. The error appears to be related to PAL/NTSC setting. I believe that you may find answer to most questions on videohelp.com
[08:57] <nrosvall> laze1989, I was just wondering the same thing
[08:57] <abrigan> Help pls withprogramming graphics. I have many lines. And i have some *.xpm image (line color), that i need to get on the line. With horizontal line it's easy. Read *.xpm image to pixmap, set GC, set tile with this pixmap and draw line with this GC. But when line is rotated - there is problems. I need that pixmap rotated too. I'm rotate pixmap with bresenham algorithm and set gc with new pixmap. And it's no worked. Painted incorrect. How I can do this, wi

[08:58] <rasanen7> What's a good MTA for forwarding *some* email to my ISPs mail servers, while keeping others local (like the default install is I guess, for reports and stuff)? I'd also like to avoid keeping plain text passwords in a file anywhere
[08:58] <elfer> yeah videohelp is a great site... not sure how much they support linux tho
[08:58] <angryWolf> thank you alimj.  I have read about a file at /.config/Video_Format with a "PAL" in it. used it to be a text file or will i need another extension?
[08:59] <non-> <DerHeks> I guess it's the .c file in the directory, I'll try figure this one out...
[09:00] <alimj> angryWolf: I believe that you have to edit the main XML project file. Some tags should be added there. I am not sue where.
[09:02] <alimj> angryWolf: I am trying to remember
[09:02] <isildur> !ita
[09:02] <angryWolf> very kind... i wait
[09:03] <isildur> what is italian channel?
[09:03] <alimj> angyWolf: Did you try this? "export VIDEO_FORMAT=PAL"
[09:03] <angryWolf> i know the tag should be a "PAL" in my aerea. It is important to find the main xml file.
[09:03] <Eagleman> !it
[09:03] <ubottu> Vai su #ubuntu-it se vuoi parlare in italiano, in questo canale usiamo solo l'inglese. Grazie! (per entrare, scrivi « /join #ubuntu-it » senza virgolette)
[09:04] <nearst> !it | isildur
[09:04] <ubottu> isildur: please see above
[09:05] <alimj> angryWolf: Or in the main XML file, in the <video> tag, there should be format="pal"
[09:05] <biopyte> HackinBlack, ubuntu-tweak, found it, thx
[09:06] <angryWolf> But where is those xml file?  The answers will be right for sure.
[09:06] <alimj> angryWolf: It has been long long ago, I switched to MP4 for all of my videos. Do not have a DVD anymore. I could not fully remember...

[09:21] <Ben64> its in open beta
[09:22] <jrtappers> thanks, is there a way to add terminal as a window manager choice?
[09:22] <dr_willis> jrtappers:  alt-ctrl-f1 to get to a console ;) you mean?
[09:23] <dr_willis> you can make custome x session desktops if you want
[09:23] <jrtappers> As in at the greeter screen, to have an option in the list for terminal
[09:23] <dr_willis> or use a tiny window manager like jwm and launch some terms
[09:24] <Ben64> you can open a terminal any time you want
[09:24] <dr_willis> running xterm with no window manager would be annoying
[09:24] <Ben64> yeah
[09:24] <Bsims> jrtappers: it sounds like you are wanting awesome or something like that

[10:46] <Scanjet0> Uhm, Im doing a study on hacking, hence I picked linux to do my OS with. What would you say is the best method of detecting hackings in Linux?
[10:46] <Scanjet0> (as a kind of anti-measure, knowledge is power:P)
[10:46] <aeon-ltd> Scanjet0: your question didn't make sense
[10:46] <zhaozhou> Scanjet0, What type of 'hacking' are you looking for?

[10:46] <Scanjet0> its legal, I have consent (im hacking myself)
[10:47] <Scanjet0> Xarp, I will google that right away!

[11:02] <kelvinella> When you select any of the menus in Nautilus they only display a very small blank rectangle under the menu item and do not open up into a sub-menu display.  how to fix?
[11:02] <devnull_> kelvinella, does this happen all the time or new problem
[11:03] <kelvinella> i never click the menu before until now
[11:03] <kelvinella> because i want to enable the status bar
[11:03] <devnull_> do other programs have functioning menus
[11:03] <kelvinella> other programs have no problem
[11:04] <Vivekananda> zhaozhou: I dont know if this is a setting provided by my router or ubuntu itself on my computer or something the ISP provides. I just know that my voip reregister time when set to 100 or 120 secs works and does not drop calls but when set to higher like 900(as is advised for TCP as it is supposed to have a higher timeout value???) causes calls to drop. Is this something I set in ubuntu or ask my ISP(comcast ) for ?

[11:08] <jabba_> i just setup a crypted partition (SR for a Xen-Server). and added it to the /etc/crypttab with the option "timeout=30". sadly the option seems to be ignored (as boot-process keeps going on) and i am not able to enter the passphrase at boot. anyone an idea what's wrong?
[11:09] <jrtappers> devnull_, thanks that worked perfectly

[11:25] <Xabster> i got help about 1.5 hours ago, about installing additional drivers (for my gfx card while booted up on a live cd - just to test that everything works) but i had to leave and didnt see the answer fully
[11:26] <MonkeyDust> LudwigVonMises  yes, it says: "If nobody is here use  http://askubuntu.com/questions/tagged/mobile"
[11:26] <Xabster> does anyone have a log maybe or know how i can install it? i cant find the additional drivers dialog/menu
[11:26] <jrtappers> Xabster, whats the status?
[11:26] <Xabster> i had a guest
[11:26] <Xabster> status is no progress
[11:26] <jrtappers> Xabster, go to dash, and search for "Add", you shoudl see additional drivers

[11:26] <LudwigVonMises> MonkeyDust: Can't ubuntu mobile be refferring to the android app?
[11:27] <jrtappers> ok, the other way
[11:27] <atlef> Xabster, i think they suggested you install to a usb stick, not creating a "live USB" to test it out
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[11:28] <Xabster> hmm, any idea of how much space is needed for that? the usb stick is 3.8 gb total
[11:28] <MonkeyDust> LudwigVonMises  yeah, but easiest would be to go and ask in #ubuntu-phone
[11:28] <Xabster> and some is used for the live cd boot stuff - i have no cd rom
[11:28] <jrtappers> Xabster, the easiest way to try ubuntu not on a live cd/usb is wubi
[11:28] <Xabster> wubi?
[11:28] <pablo__> olbap
[11:28] <cfhowlett> jrtappers: or virtualbox
[11:29] <Xabster> i did try virtualbox, but that doesnt answer the question of drivers
[11:29] <Xabster> since its vbox generic drivers
[11:29] <Xabster> i need to test that my real gfx driver actually works
[11:29] <atlef> cfhowlett, not if he needs to test if the driver for his gfx works, then vbox wont helpp
[11:29] <atlef> *help

[11:31] <Xabster> should I install it, or just test if its installed? cause its not

[11:36] <Porkepix>  Hi. I come here to ask some informations about erratic behavior with a touchpad. My sister just received 1 week ago a dell laptop shipped with ubuntu pre-installed (vostro 3360). The problem is that the touchpad is only saw as generic PS/2 mouse and that it cause lot of problems. I eventually found a driver made via reverse engineering, but compilation fail and I can't install it. If someone can help about this, please ?
[11:36] <blim> that list my graphics card as a hole and not the hdmi sound, maybe I cant disable it this way
[11:37] <nibbler_> Porkepix: can you nopaste the output of the attempted build of the driver? what is the name of the driver?
[11:37] <atlef> blim, try lspci -v
[11:38] <Porkepix> nibbler_ : 1s, I'll directly connect to irc the right laptop, it'll be easier
[11:38] <theos> hey all! i plugged in my usb hdd and now i have no permissions on internal hdd partitions and files. what can be the solution?

[11:40] <atlef> anyone else being disconnected from irc randomly?
[11:41] <theos> dr_willis fat32. i was trying to back up the data and format it to ext4 :/ but i dont have permissions now
[11:41] <Porkepix2> So, nibbler_, the driver is this one : http://www.dahetral.com/public-download
[11:41] <dr_willis> theos:  access it as root perhaps. or remount it with difernt options
[11:41] <rgms> &wc
[11:42] <nibbler_> theos: mount options to make it user owned, chown and chmod
[11:42] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: and here is the terminal log : http://privatepaste.com/5426f647d5
[11:42] <dr_willis> you normally dont chown/chmod ntf/vfat
[11:42] <jrtappers> Xabster, try it, it should be already installed
[11:42] <theos> nibbler_ the fstab file has the same options as before. i remounted both drives but no help
[11:43] <dr_willis> theos:  what does mount say about its options
[11:43] <theos> dr_willis how to check those?
[11:43] <dr_willis> use the mount command
[11:44] <theos> dr_willis rw,nosuid,nodev,uid=1000,gid=1000
[11:44] <ctrlz> Hi, how can i rotate the webcam in skype? I see it upside down. Lubuntu 12.10 x64 on asus u36sd here
[11:44] <dr_willis> theos:  now see what your users UID is.
[11:44] <theos> dr_willis 1000?
[11:44] <dr_willis> you sure?
[11:45] <theos> dr_willis how to check uid?
[11:45] <dr_willis>  echo $UID
[11:45] <Xabster> jrtappers: when i try it says not installed and that i can get it with sudo apt-get install etc
[11:45] <theos> dr_willis thanks. yes it is 1000
[11:45] <Xabster> copy/pasting the suggest command in terminal says not found
[11:46] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: I can change $LANG in terminal to have full english messages, but differences are really small
[11:46] <dr_willis> theos:  can you access it via the terminal? cd to its mountmoint and do a ls -l, see who owns what files
[11:46] <blim> atlef: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1491588/plain/
[11:46] <BWMerlin> is there a way I can add source forge as a repository so I can apt-get projects straight from there?
[11:47] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: i'm fine with the french(?) output... which package did you download?
[11:47] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: did you honour the first message this script is giving you? dkms_install_cp/symlink?
[11:47] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: the last, this one : http://www.dahetral.com/public-download/psmouse-alps-dst-1.2.tbz/view
[11:47] <theos> dr_willis all files are like this -> -rwxr-xr-x  1 myuser myuser
[11:47] <atlef> blim, i would think that 05:00.1 is the hw id of the hdmi, but not sure
[11:48] <theos> dr_willis maybe its not recognizing me as the user?
[11:48] <dr_willis> theos:  so you cant read or write there or what?
[11:49] <blim> atlef: would I need to add just [Radeon HD 6900 Series] to blacklist?
[11:49] <nibbler_> Porkepix2?
[11:49] <dr_willis> theos:  your user name is not 'myuser' ?
[11:49] <kylescottmcgill> Anyone had Automount setup with udev on ubuntu, or do they use something else like gfvs? (I dont have Nautalis, or thunar etc, i use ranger)
[11:49] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: the first one fail, the 2nd give nothing
[11:49] <theos> dr_willis i cant copy, paste etc. yes my user name is myuser
[11:49] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: nothing sounds good, did you do that before or after the paste you gave me? what error are you getting, nopaste pls
[11:50] <dr_willis> theos:  try with the shell. Not nautilus perhaps.. can you cd to where they are at and do a 'touch testfile' ?
[11:50] <atlef> blim, could you post complete output of lspci -v
[11:51] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: I haven't done this before. I did this now and rerun the command after. So install_cp don't find a folder, and install_symlink change nothing. After this, "dkms_build_alps" faile the same way
[11:51] <theos> dr_willis i did. no output.
[11:52] <dr_willis> theos:  no error message? do a ls -l . see if  it worked
[11:52] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: full output of the _cp pls
[11:52] <kylescottmcgill> no one have any recomendations
[11:53] <kylescottmcgill> argh s[elling tonight is shocking
[11:53] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: http://privatepaste.com/53d5c860eb
[11:53] <theos> dr_willis yes the timestamp changed. no error on touch
[11:53] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: for sure, this dir doesn't exist
[11:54] <blim> atlef: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1491619/plain/
[11:54] <dr_willis> theos:  try editing a test file , see if you can make it. and sav3 changes.. Its almost sounding like its just nautilus having issues. Not the actual filesystem
[11:54] <theos> dr_willis i killed nautilus and now everything is fine. thanks
[11:54] <dr_willis> theos:  ;P
[11:54] <theos> dr_willis :D

[11:57] <blim> thanks very much, I'll save what I've done for next time
[11:57] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: for my part, I guess all files are in place, and compilation fail for strange reason on a .o file :/

[12:02] <nibbler_> Porkepix2:  BTN_TOOL_QUINTTAP was suggest 22. august 2011.... so my first guess is, your kernel is too old for that
[12:03] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: kernel 3.0, pre-installed ubuntu 11.10
[12:04] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: i noteiced the 3.0 before - but still thought this makro might be a driver thing and not inherited from the kernel - but thats your problem. its about 4-finger-scroll-gestures
[12:04] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: so either update to a more recent ubuntu, or backport the code? ;-)

[12:05] <wachpwnski> nibbler_:  that is not giving me anything useful
[12:05] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: I can try to install a 12.04 or 12.10....but idk if it'll really help :/ Just want that my touchpad is recognized as....
[12:05] <wachpwnski> nibbler_:  unless that is the has?
[12:05] <vlt> wachpwnski: /dev/disk/by-id/* is usually a symlink to the actual device. `ls -l` should tell you.

[12:06] <[Saint]> Is anyone able to give me any clues on why All Settings/Details/Graphics lists my graphics driver as "Unknown"? An how to find out what driver I'm actually using?
[12:06] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: http://lxr.free-electrons.com/ident?v=3.0;i=BTN_TOOL_QUINTTAP - if you click a more recent kernel, it suddenly is defined - this driver won't build with kernel 3.0, end of story
[12:07] <atlef> [Saint], try lspci -v in a terminal and look for it there
[12:07] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: Ok. So I'll check with more recent ubuntu or other linux. Beggining with 3.1 it's ok ?
[12:07] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: i have no clue if this driver will help you in the end at all, but i do know that it wont build in unpatched 3.0 - ofc you could "just" patch it in, but depending on your skill level installing ubuntu 12.10 might be the easiest approach
[12:07] <thecpaptain> Internet-ID Sweden on Ubuntu. Gotten most things going, any ideas from anyone?

[12:08] <[Saint]> atlef: the card is definitely being detectyed, and it is in use, but I don't know what driver it is using :-S
[12:08] <[Saint]> It's an /old/ card, but it is supported (apparently).
[12:09] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: ok, thanks. I'll test this. In all cases, is there a way to complain at canonical, which have given a certification for ubuntu on a laptop.....which have an unrecognized touchpad ?
[12:10] <MonkeyDust> Porkepix2  or report a bug at launchpad
[12:10] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: i dont know - maybe cononical certified it, as it is good suppored in recent ubuntu, but then dell shipped it with outdated ubuntu? i don't know - you want 12.10 anyway! :)
[12:10] <atlef> [Saint], did you try lspci -v in a terminal and look for it there
[12:10] <ashleyludlow> base could be installed with generic drivers for lan use, its been proven even in "unsupported" systems it works for lan..
[12:11] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: the laptop was shipped with a pre-installed ubuntu (11.10). I guess this is the minimum to have a fully functionnal system :/
[12:12] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: well - then again, did you install all the updates offered? 12.4/10 should have been offered..
[12:12] <[Saint]> atlef: yes, sorry, I wasn't very verbose there...it's some weird shit: "Kernel driver in use: unknown
[12:12] <[Saint]> 	Kernel modules: unknown
[12:12] <[Saint]> "
[12:12] <[Saint]> I'm not even sure how that is possible...but, that's what it gives me.
[12:12] <ashleyludlow> may i ask the whole issue plz?
[12:12] <atlef> [Saint], ah, then im not sure what to do
[12:13] <MonkeyDust> !who | ashleyludlow

[12:13] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: nop, not atm.....very important internet connectivity issues atm....I'll need more than a week to download all
[12:14] <[Saint]> atlef: assuming it did list the driver in use there, but still displayed the driver as unknown via the settings...did you have a solution?
[12:14] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: well, i'd say you have a good shot that just installing latest ubuntu will solve your issues directly
[12:14] <atlef> [Saint], sorry
[12:14] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: if its new, just try to get your hands on a installer-cd
[12:14] <[Saint]> just wondering how far I should bother poking at this. I have working graphics, but am stuck with a 'standard' experience...which isn't so bad, but the card is plenty capable.
[12:15] <Porkepix2> nibbler_: not the basic one : I booted a 12.10 on live usb, same erratic behavior. But I haven't tried to compile driver on this one
[12:15] <atlef> [Saint], what gfx card is this
[12:16] <nibbler_> Porkepix2: if you have a live usb, this might be good for installing or even updating

[12:35] <Elvinz> is it possible to force unity to maximize all app at launch, so as not to have to click on the maximize button everytime ?
[12:35] <[Saint]> I will do, but at the present point, I couldn;t possibly make it any less usable I don't think :)

[13:03] <MonkeyDust> Bieliq  with archive manager
[13:03] <MonkeyDust> Bieliq  libre office is in the repos, no need for a tar file
[13:03] <[Saint]> Isn't OO.o already a part of 12.04?

[13:04] <mathnode> Yeah it's just called Libre Office.
[13:04] <Bieliq> but libre office is open office ??

[13:04] <MonkeyDust> and not from oracle

[13:05] <mathnode> Bieliq: Ubuntu Software Center?
[13:06] <[Saint]> thought "sudo apt-get install <package_name>" isn't all that intimidating after time.
[13:06] <MonkeyDust> Bieliq  commands give a lot more control over your ubuntu system, better get used to it
[13:06] <Bieliq> but in ubuntu are programs from repositories only and sometimes u can find smth in net for ubuntu in tar gz file so i just ask for future if i needed smth to install manually
[13:07] <[Saint]> *you *something
[13:07] <Bieliq> hm guess i will need to get used
[13:07] <MonkeyDust> Bieliq  use archive manager
[13:07] <Bieliq> in archive i can unpack right ? but then what to do next ?
[13:08] <mar77i> hello. running ubuntu with dual-monitor on RADEON, and the left screen keeps blinking ... wtf, I'm just seeing it's set to 59.9hz

=== vikas is now known as Guest15797
[13:08] <jrib> Bieliq: it depends on the software.  tar.gz is like zip.  It's just a bunch of files.  Anything can be in there.  There's no one universal way to deal with software like that other than telling you to read its documentation.  Ideally you would instead find the software in the repositories or as a .deb for your ubuntu version.  If you can't and you aren't sure what to do, you can come here and ask for

[13:11] <mar77i> oh just noticed I'm calling xrandr anyway in the .xsession, will try setting --rate
[13:11] <jrib> Vivek: your update-rc.d is a no-op since ufw is started by upstart (/etc/init/ufw.conf).  I don't know much about ufw but I assume that just running "sudo ufw disable" would disable it in the future.  Have you checked its documentation?
[13:11] <wdp> is there some tool in ubuntu to set the brightness and contrast for a monitor?
[13:11] <MonkeyDust> Vivek  sudo ufw disable
[13:11] <wdp> i searched in the settings, but there's nothing like that
[13:11] <iceroot> Vivek: sudo ufw disable
[13:11] <Vivek> I already did a sudo ufw disable

[13:12] <MonkeyDust> Vivek  great, that's the way to do it
[13:12] <Vivek> MonkeyDust: It is not working
[13:12] <jrib> Vivek: and what's ufw status?
[13:12] <Vivek> After I do a ufw disable it is showing inactive
[13:12] <jrib> Vivek: and after you reboot...
[13:12] <Vivek> let me check the status after the reboot
[13:13] <Vivek> It is still inactive
[13:13] <Vivek> But I have iptables rules there....
[13:13] <jrib> Vivek: were there iptables rules before you rebooted?
[13:13] <Vivek> Yes
[13:13] <Vivek> Whatever was set by Ubuntu server 12.04 by default.
[13:13] <jrib> Vivek: there are no rules by default
[13:13] <Vivek> I did not set any riles.
[13:13] <jrib> Vivek: right, so you need to figure out where they are coming from if "ufw disable" isn't disabling them
[13:13] <TakeItEZ> Vivek: so you likely have an "iptables-restore" script somewhere
[13:14] <Vivek> ok
[13:14] <jrib> Vivek: did you install an official ubuntu image?
[13:14] <Vivek> Yes.
[13:14] <TStarkH> Hi
[13:14] <jrib> Vivek: what are the rules?
[13:14] <Vivek> TakeItEZ: What do you want me to do with the iptables-restore script ?
[13:15] <jrib> at least last time I checked, there were no rules by default.  Maybe that changed.
[13:15] <Vivek> jrib: brb, let me copy the rules.
[13:15] <blami> Vivek: pastebin them
[13:16] <blami> jrib: maybe he saved rules set by ufw I accidentaly did same thing once
[13:16] <TStarkH> I need assistance with video drivers. Can somebody help me?
[13:16] <TakeItEZ> Vivek: if ufw isn't running and restoring your rules, there seeem to be either a script using iptables-restore doing it or iptables-persistent

[13:30] <iceroot> kesor: 5.x will be the highest you will find officially for ubuntu
=== Jens is now known as Guest74820
[13:30] <iceroot> kesor: even 12.10 has 5.x
[13:30] <TStarkH> Is there a stable version of AMD drivers for ubuntu 12.10?
[13:30] <kesor> iceroot: i know, and my client unfortunately is still using mostly lucid on all the servers.
[13:31] <iceroot> kesor: and lucid has 5.x in backports, so what is the problem?
[13:31] <Vivek>  blami, TakeItEZ, jrib, MonkeyDust : http://fpaste.org/q8L4/
[13:31] <Pici> kesor: I only see rsyslog7 in debian experimental, which definitely hasn't been synced to any Ubuntus.
[13:31] <Vivek> That is what the I.P Tables rules look like after the server is rebooted after a ufw disable...
[13:31] <kesor> iceroot: it does? … pretty sure it doesnt
[13:31] <TakeItEZ> kesor: rsyslog.com has an ubuntu-repo, check it
[13:32] <iceroot> [14:29]     kesor | backports also only has version 5.x etc..
[13:32] <kesor> TakeItEZ: their repo only has the -devel and not the -stable version, and its for precise only.
[13:32] <iceroot> kesor: and why you need 7.x?
[13:32] <iceroot> kesor: because its newer?
[13:33] <TakeItEZ> kesor: i'd guess you have to build it yourself then
[13:33] <kesor> iceroot: no, because it has several bugs fixed in features I am using.
[13:33] <Vivek> TakeItEZ:  http://fpaste.org/q8L4/
[13:33] <kesor> the fun of building packages myself … always works, with the exception of core dumps and the code debugging you have to do to make sure the patches actually work … etc.
[13:33] <Vivek> sorry for reposting, thought you missed my post.
[13:34] <iceroot> kesor: the main problem is that debian is not using it anymore so the normal sync from debian will give the old-stable version
[13:34] <wifi> hi, i got a problem with my wireless network connection. I get connected, i am able to surf 2-3 pages in the browser, then it breaks, and even though the connection is still active, i am unable to do anything that implies internet
[13:34] <kesor> iceroot: debian is not using rsyslog anymore? … don't they have it in experimental?
[13:34] <Vivek> That is the iptables rules that show up after the server reboot even after ufw disable is done.
[13:34] <iceroot> kesor: and if there is no good reason ubuntu will not build 7.x instead of the 5.x sync from debian
[13:34] <Pici> iceroot: version 7 is in debian experimental
[13:35] <kesor> iceroot: ubuntu is always behind debian now
[13:35] <kesor> ?
[13:35] <iceroot> kesor: no
[13:35] <kesor> iceroot: so I don't understand your argument
[13:35] <iceroot> Pici: ah ok my last info was it has an older version because it will be skipped
[13:36] <cordoval> solved it http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2092298
[13:36] <cordoval> thanks
[13:39] <iceroot> kesor: it was added some month ago in experimental. even sid has 5.x
[13:39] <kesor> how hard is it to backport debian experimental packages to lucid? all I know how to do is pull-debian-source rsyslog experimental ...
[13:39] <iceroot> kesor: and normally ubuntu is syncing from sid and not experimental
[13:40] <chemist^> hello everyone! I hope someone can help me solve my problem..... i'm using ubuntu 12.04 ... when i listen to music in any application and want to turn down the volume...when i change the Master volume with my keyboard, the sound of the music only slightly lowers it self.... almost no difference between 99% and 1% volume .... but when i mute it...it mutes the music too...
[13:40] <xetius> my gnome-terminal crashes when I try to access any of the menus, or do anything like opening a new tab.  Any ideas how to fix this?
[13:40] <chemist^> how can i set the key on my keyboard to change the volume of all the channels at the same time?
[13:40] <chemist^> so no matter what i do...when i press to lower the volume it actually lowers it...?
[13:40] <sw> !keys | chemist^
[13:40] <ubottu> chemist^: Keyboard shortcuts can be set in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. If your multimedia keys don't work with that, try the 'keytouch' package, explained at http://keytouch.sourceforge.net/ - See !Keyboard for changing layouts. A list of keyboard shortcuts for Unity is available at http://ubottu.com/y/shortcuts
[13:41] <iceroot> kesor: for a quick testing, download the source-package, install the builddepbs and use "sudo dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot"  or use the deb directly but mixing repos/packages is not supported here
[13:41] <chemist^> sw i know that
[13:41] <sw> chemist^ Then?
[13:41] <kesor> iceroot: "pull-debian-source rsyslog experimental ; dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot" ?
[13:41] <chemist^> wait a sec
[13:42] <iceroot> kesor: you also need the builddeps
[13:42] <chemist^> sw the key does change the volume
[13:42] <chemist^> but the music is still loud
[13:42] <kesor> oh how I hate package building :(
[13:42] <chemist^> even if master output volume is 2%
[13:42] <jCuber> sw: chemist^ : I think whar chemist^ is trying to do is change the volume keybinds to change all of the channels at once
[13:42] <chemist^> yes
[13:42] <chemist^> sorry for my bad english
[13:43] <chemist^> it's a bit rusty :D
[13:43] <chemist^> i'll make an example
[13:44] <chemist^> I want to listen to an mp3...so i open it in VLC or amarok ... when i change the volume from 100% to 2% with my keyboard or with the mouse ... the music is only a little less loud then before
[13:44] <chemist^> almost no change in volume
[13:45] <chemist^> anyone? :)
[13:45] <iceroot> kesor: i would not do it if i look at the list of dependencies..initscripts.. which is pulling a lot of new stuff which is not in ubuntu yet
[13:45] <w3bg33k> anyone have issues with turnkey linux?
[13:46] <iceroot> kesor: there is a very good reason why 7.x is in experimental and not sid or anything else
[13:46] <MonkeyDust> chemist^  open a terminal and type alsamixer, see if you can change sth there
[13:46] <iceroot> w3bg33k: is that ubuntu related?
[13:46] <kesor> iceroot: can't I just install debian packages from experimental in lucid ubuntu and tell apt to ignore the various numbers and stuff?
[13:46] <w3bg33k> iceroot - yes
[13:46] <iceroot> kesor: dont do that
[13:47] <chemist^> MonkeyDust, i have already... the sound gets lower if i change the PCM volume
[13:48] <preds> will the pulse run by my user use values from /etc/pulse/ or do I need to copy files or something
[13:48] <chemist^> but how do i make my keyboard shortcut lower PCM instead of master...or even better both at the same time
[13:48] <preds> the sound quality is notably lacking and I'm trying to do something about it

[14:05] <xetius> MonkeyDust: ubuntu 12.10 and gnome 3.7.3.  When I access the menus on gnome-terminal, it just disappears, almost like closing it
[14:05] <xetius> no chance to enter a crash report or anything like that
[14:06] <MonkeyDust> xetius  the current version in 12.10 is 3.6 -- anything higher is not from the repos and not supported, i'm afraid
[14:06] <xetius> ok, fair enough.  thanks
[14:07] <MonkeyDust> xetius  why not simply use the version from the repos?
[14:07] <xetius> Actually, I can't remember how I got this.  Don't know how to roll back either

[14:43] <ukebane> would removing java by removing all the locations stated in "whereis java" cause a lot of errors or is it a valid way to remove it?
[14:44] <Osakasa> SnowmanX11, i managed to install 12.11 beta for HD6000. running 12.04
[14:44] <Touhou11> ukebane: You should remove it using the package manager (assuming that's how you installed it)
[14:44] <T3X> what is the best torrent software for linux?
[14:45] <T3X> which i can use on Terminal
[14:45] <ukebane> Touhou11: I already removed the java's I could find in the package manager, but it still shows up and runs
[14:45] <Rismos> t3x: rtorrent
[14:45] <Osakasa> SnowmanX11, there is a stupid watermark bottom-right corner with block a view sometimes :(
[14:45] <MonkeyDust> T3X  deluge and transmission are nice
[14:45] <MonkeyDust> ah terminal
[14:45] <T3X> yep terminal
[14:45] <Rismos> t3x: keyboard shortcuts take some getting used to but it's a nice/simple/fast torrent client that runs in terminal

[14:52] <wdp> how can i disabled that the file / edit / etc menu is at the top?
[14:52] <Touhou11> ukebane: Those might just be symbolic links, also unless you do a complete removal configuration files in /etc/ are always left behind after uninstalling
[14:52] <ukebane> Touhou11: running java -version still runs and shows me the version
[14:52] <wdp> s/disabled/disable
[14:52] <ukebane> Touhou11: which indicates the program is still there
[14:53] <Touhou11> ukebane: Have you searched for "jre", "jdk", "icedtea" etc. in the software centre? Or try synaptic/CLI to search instead, the software centre is not very powerful

[15:13] <Touhou11> kesor: You're doing something wrong, it shouldn't be difficult
[15:13] <apt-get_install> anyone here that can explain what "acpitz" in lm-senors is?
[15:13] <kylescottmcgill> MaximB: i think we would be a way away yet before its released
[15:14] <jrib> kesor: pbuilder is just a convenience so you don't pollute your environment and to verify you've really listed all the build-deps
[15:14] <MaximB> like 1-2 years ?
[15:14] <kesor> Touhou11: I'm trying to backport existing packages to lucid … and its extremely hard.
[15:14] <ukebane> kylescottmcgill: ehh, I forgot the apt-get command
[15:14] <kylescottmcgill> nah i would say like 6 - 8 months before it starts popping up on how to compile and build etc
[15:14] <kesor> jrib: yep. just waiting for the error to pop again and I'll show you
[15:14] <kylescottmcgill> ukebane: sudo apt-cache search jdk
[15:14] <jrib> kesor: you know there's a tool for backporting too
[15:14] <kylescottmcgill> then sudo apt-get install <package>
[15:15] <ukebane> kylescottmcgill: for purging it :P
[15:15] <kesor> jrib: really?
[15:15] <jrib> !backport | kesor
[15:15] <ubottu> kesor: If new updated Ubuntu packages are built for an application, then they may go into Ubuntu Backports. See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports - See also !packaging
[15:15] <ukebane> kylescottmcgill: I'm planning on installing it manually remember
[15:15] <MaximB> kylescottmcgill: the problem is that it won't support android apps.... and ubuntu isn't that major on itself to make developers program apps for it
[15:15] <kesor> jrib: i don't know all that much, I just waste lots of time building packages.
[15:15] <kylescottmcgill> sudo apt-get remove --purge jdk ?
[15:15] <jrib> kesor: well once you spend time doing it once, I don't see why it would take very long
[15:15] <ukebane> excellent, unable to locate package jdk
[15:15] <apt-get_install> kylescottmcgill: or sudo apt-get pruge jdk
[15:16] <kesor> jrib: what you just linked, it explains how to use the UI to open windows and stuff … wtf?
[15:16] <kylescottmcgill> MaximB: yeah they will be going through testing etc, its more an advertisement i would think
[15:16] <kesor> jrib: its not a tool, its just description how to add backports to apt sources.
[15:16] <MaximB> ok thanks....see you in 6-7 months :D ...just kidding
[15:16] <helmut_> hi
[15:17] <xBytez> hello helmut_.
[15:17] <apt-get_install> anyone here that can explain what "acpitz" in lm-senors is?
[15:17] <jrib> kesor: are you sure...?
[15:17] <kylescottmcgill> ukebane: sorry you were purging java wernt you, but you want jdk
[15:18] <kesor> jrib: yeah, pretty sure.
[15:18] <jrib> kesor: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBackports linked from that page
[15:18] <kylescottmcgill> apt-get_install: im guessing its an abstraction layer for apci ?
[15:18] <jrib> kesor: but anyway, I usually do what you are doing (just grab the source from a later release, verify deps are satisfied, and rebuild)
[15:18] <ukebane> kylescottmcgill: actually after restarting lightdm I have the latest version of oracle jdk it says
[15:19] <ukebane> kylescottmcgill: (I tried to install that before finding the thread)
[15:19] <apt-get_install> kylescottmcgill: what?
[15:20] <jrib> kesor: can I ask why you are trying to get a later version of rsyslog anyway?
[15:20] <dfgas> can anyone help getting my cr-48 with the modifed bios to boot efi ubuntu 12.04
[15:20] <kesor> jrib: i need some of the fixed bugs that are available in the later versions.  I'm using this script to build it - https://gist.github.com/7b209dcb88754e2b539e

[15:33] <NeoColossus1020_> Is there a quick way to copy a file while renaming it and storing it in a different dir than the current dir?
[15:33] <dfgas> apt-get_install: yes and ubuntu installs just fine
[15:33] <RicCrouch> @jrtappers_ : Have you tried the "Additional Drivers" item in system settings?
[15:33] <jrib> NeoColossus1020_: you mean in the gui?
[15:33] <apt-get_install> dfgas: but u cant boot?
[15:34] <NeoColossus1020_> jrib, in terminal.
[15:34] <jrib> NeoColossus1020_: uh, just use cp
[15:34] <jrtappers_> tried the Additional drivers, it fails Log: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1492287/

[15:34] <mikecmpbll> 8bit
[15:34] <kylescottmcgill> im not looking to start a flame war, but in terms of generic widget based applets, is bash or lua faster? anyone have any experience with both?
[15:34] <NeoColossus1020_> But I also need it to mv to a different dir after it is renamed.
[15:34] <NeoColossus1020_> Can I pipe this?
[15:34] <apt-get_install> dfgas: so, after install, u go to rebbot, and then it doesnt srart?
[15:35] <apt-get_install> jrtappers_: 32 or 64 bit?
[15:35] <jrtappers_> 32

[15:41] <dfgas> apt-get_install: already installed and on live cd right now

[15:42] <apt-get_install> dfgas: okey, install grub2 uefi et_install, last time I tried this I had t
[15:42] <apt-get_install> jrtappers_: okey, try the beta then
[15:42] <jrtappers_> apt-get_install, think I did something wrong
[15:42] <kylescottmcgill> dfgas: are you dual booting, on an uefi motherboard, and what partition is your HDD in? GPT/MBR
[15:42] <Miebster1> rumpe1: becuase I will add skip=1, i'm just trying to trim off the first 340 bytes

[15:43] <Lofde_> benkaiser, thanks
[15:43] <Miebster1> Is there an easier way to trim off some bytes at the beginning of a file?
[15:43] <NeoColossus1020_> cp -fs ~/dir/test ~/dir/tmp/test.bak seemed to work.
[15:44] <adam-33> BluesKaj, when it is activated, is it using ephemeral keys?
[15:44] <BluesKaj> adam-33, what are ephemeral keys ? :)
[15:44] <jrib> NeoColossus1020_: erm, -s will make a symlink, not copy...
[15:44] <NeoColossus1020_> Right, I was wondering about that. How is it different?
[15:45] <dfgas> apt-get_install: ? i don't understand
[15:45] <xro> Hi, i use dynamips but i get CPU load = 200%... do you know the problem? is there a fix? i use 12.04
[15:45] <kylescottmcgill> NeoColossus1020_: Symlinks are basically shortcuts
[15:45] <kylescottmcgill> cp -rvf <old> <new>
[15:45] <jrib> NeoColossus1020_: it's like a shortcut that points to the original file.  If you delete the original, you'll be left with a shortcut that points to nothing :)
[15:45] <jrib> you just need cp old new
[15:45] <NeoColossus1020_> If you make edits to the original, does it effect the symlink?
[15:45] <MonkeyDust> xro  dynamips is a Cisco thingy... server?
[15:45] <adam-33> BluesKaj, as far as I know, they are alive only for a session and the next time you turn on the machine, there will be a new key.
[15:45] <apt-get_install> dfgas: u must build and install grub 2 (u)efi
[15:46] <xro> MonkeyDust, yes it is used by gsn3 (network simulator)
[15:46] <apt-get_install> dfgas: just do as the site says
[15:46] <dfgas> apt-get_install: oh i need download grub2 source?
[15:46] <jrib> NeoColossus1020_: the symlink just points to the original file.  If you make edits to the original file, then the symlink points at your file (with the edits of course)
[15:46] <MonkeyDust> xro  #ubuntu-server
[15:46] <apt-get_install> dfgas: yea
[15:47] <apt-get_install> and install it
[15:47] <apt-get_install> manually
[15:47] <BluesKaj> adam-33, no idea , I didn't even know encrypting the swap partition or the data held there was someting to be concerned about
[15:47] <NeoColossus1020_> Okay yeah, definitely don't want that then. I want to be able to to store the original as a backup and then make edits to the one copied from, having the original to go back to when needed.
[15:47] <dfgas> apt-get_install: i should be chrooted into my install right when i do this?
[15:47] <xro> MonkeyDust, why? i use it in a "normal" ubuntu distro... not a server one
[15:47] <sachael> anyone know of a civilized way of streaming radio streams in console, apart from mplayer?
[15:48] <jrib> NeoColossus1020_: cp old new
[15:48] <kylescottmcgill> BluesKaj: normally you wouldnt really encrypt it, you would leave the parition RAW, so its faster to read and write, in the GOVT everything has to be encrypted, but you could retreive stuff out of swap if your uber
[15:48] <MonkeyDust> xro  i asked "server?", you said yes... nvm the other channel then
[15:48] <Touhou11> sachael: VLC has a CLI
[15:48] <jrib> sachael: what's wrong with mplayer?
[15:48] <ivotkl> Hello. =)
[15:48] <jrtappers_> how can I fix apt get, I have an "unmet dependency" that wont install and so its all stuck?
=== cielo is now known as Guest76860
[15:48] <jrib> jrtappers_: you need to pastebin your command and full output
[15:49] <apt-get_install> dfgas: i think so. never installed grub 2 manually before
[15:49] <kylescottmcgill> sachael: you could pipe something to your /dev/speakers but that would be a mission, i would just use mplayer, or something else like cmus or something
[15:49] <xro> MonkeyDust, ohhh i did not understand "...server?"   so, my answer is no. not server :P
[15:49] <apt-get_install> dfgas: chrooted into / should be a good idea
[15:50] <dfgas> apt-get_install: i did install grub-efi and did a grub-install and it found everything and looked like it installed but same thing, no boot partition found

[15:50] <apt-get_install> dfgas: chrooted?
[15:50] <dfgas> apt-get_install: yup
[15:51] <kylescottmcgill> BluesKaj: using an Encrypted Drive yes, but normally only partitions are encrypted (normally)

[15:51] <dfgas> maybe i am missing something
[15:51] <dfgas> i messed with boot flags and nothing either

[16:06] <bahamas> kylescottmcgill: ok, thanks. I'll write it down and try it next time I have the problem.
[16:06] <kylescottmcgill> lol, what were you trying to say?
[16:07] <bahamas> kylescottmcgill: btw, do you have a technical explanation of this error? I'm curious what's going on
[16:07] <kylescottmcgill> bahamas: good luck :) there should be a better fix unless your using the b43 drivers for a broadcom wifi adapter
[16:08] <BobMarley> hello, i am using the touchpad, when i click on something with the left click t is clicking 2 times, when i drag the gmaps, i can hardly do that, when i try to select a text somewhere with the left click and draging the touchpad i am also not able to do that, so what is happening? i was able to do that a few days ago
[16:09] <kylescottmcgill> bahamas: that error message looks like it has found another device listed on the same 'descriptor' and then it retries and it manages to fix it, because the dmesg time is close to boot up, i would say you have a conflict of drivers, so you should do some more digging and blacklist a kernal mod, generally for the time being restarting the network daemon should get you going again
[16:10] <wasutton3> does anyone know if i'll be able to download the ubuntu phone os to emulate and tinker with?
[16:10] <kylescottmcgill> BobMarley: sounds like your sensitivity is too high, you should be able to configure this in your mouse settings, and enable disable multi-touch
[16:11] <bahamas> kylescottmcgill: I see. I don't understand why there should be several drivers doing the same thing. it would make sense for ubuntu to only pack the right driver
[16:11] <bp0> I have a problem that I need help describing: In Ubuntu 12.04, if I turn bluetooth off and then wait until the display turns off/locks bluetooth cant be turned on again without restarting
[16:12] <bahamas> kylescottmcgill: btw, when I run lshw -C network, brcmsmac is listed as the name of the wireless driver
[16:12] <kylescottmcgill> bahamas: I have a Macbook with Ubuntu installed on it, and it tries to use the open source drivers, and then the closed source ones, so i have to black list the closed source ones, this is more or less a typical scenario of the kernal thinks it knows the correct ones, but in the end they dont work, so i have to pick the ones that do
[16:12] <kylescottmcgill> isnt brcmsmac no longer supported?

[16:17] <bahamas> kylescottmcgill: I see. I'm reluctant to dig too deep in this driver thing, because I've had problems with the wireless in the past and only upgrading ubuntu made them go away

[16:32] <Pici> drdoom: it won't.
[16:32] <AndreUbuntu> thanks anyway atlef
[16:32] <Sazpaimon> so for example, if the current last block device is /dev/xvda1, the next should be /dev/xvda2, then xvda3..xvda15, then xvdb1, xvdb2, etc

[16:42] <Steve132> I'm having trouble getting a floppy drive to work.  Anyone have any experience with that?
[16:42] <kylescottmcgill> ZenMasta: can you jump back into TTY1 and cat .xsession-errors
[16:42] <ZenMasta> Interesting thing just happened. As I mentioned, it had seemed to hault tryin g to load the desktop so I pressed the power button hoping it would do a graceful shutdown. but instead it brought me back to a terminal
[16:42] <Steve132> I'm on Ubuntu 12.10
[16:42] <ZenMasta> kylescottmcgill ok brb have to walk over to that computer
[16:42] <kylescottmcgill> kk
[16:43] <kylescottmcgill> ZenMasta: sudo dmesg might give you some more hints as to what is happening too, but by the sounds of it you need to install some GFX drivers, or something
[16:44] <ich> oh
[16:44] <kylescottmcgill> If lightdm (login screen works) but nothing after that it might be something else, xsession-errors should give you an idea of whats going wrong
[16:44] <kylescottmcgill> also sudo service lightdm restart can help sometimes
[16:47] <christine_> hi i have ubuntu 12.04 and i need the patch for preciswe

[16:48] <kylescottmcgill> precise?
[16:48] <ZenMasta> kylescottmcgill there was a lot scrolling on screen really fast
[16:48] <ZenMasta> I'm gonna install open ssh so I dont have to keep running back and forth
[16:49] <kylescottmcgill> ZenMasta: sounds like your xsession doesnt like you, so it could be a couple of things, but if you less .xsession-errors you can scroll through it
[16:49] <kylescottmcgill> ZenMasta: before you go
[16:49] <lessshaste> how do you get chromium to open word attachments using libreoffice and not abiword?
[16:49] <kylescottmcgill> ZenMasta: rm .xsessions-errors ; sudo service lightdm restart
[16:49] <christine_> hi can anyone help me with a patch for precision ubuntu 12.04
[16:49] <kylescottmcgill> then try login, wait for it to stall
[16:50] <ZenMasta> okay Ill try that
[16:50] <kylescottmcgill> jump into TTY1 and less .xsession-errors and you will have fresh errors to look at, at the very top it should say something that went wrong
[16:50] <kylescottmcgill> and give us something to google

I can login via Alt-Ctrl-F1 to textconsole, but in which log file should I search for understand the problem and repair it?
[16:51] <kylescottmcgill> lessshaste: you have to change the mime / default file associations, inside System Settings under Details there will be a default Applications menu
[16:51] <Steve132> I try putting any disk in my floppy drive, and it says "input/output error" when I navigate to /media/floppy and run ls
[16:51] <Dj_FlyBy> would it be wise/easy to "upgrade" a media/web server from 10.04 LTS to 12.04.1 LTS through the "Update Manager" ?
[16:51] <rsser> ae, does it take long time to release ubuntu mobile? I saw the Mark Shuthland talking about ubuntu mobile

[16:52] <yugnip> lessshaste, you can right-click a word type file and choose "open with" and choose libreoffice rather than abiword
[16:52] <rsser> Sutherland*
[16:52] <lessshaste> yugnip, you can't sadly in gmail
[16:52] <yugnip> you click that file once it's downloaded
[16:52] <Steve132> kyelescottmcgill: yep
[16:52] <lessshaste> yugnip, it seems that ubuntu is set to open that type of file with abiword
[16:52] <lessshaste> yugnip, sure but I would like the default app not to be abiword
[16:53] <kylescottmcgill> rhinux: ~/.xsession-errors will have most of your X Server errors, thats a good place to start
[16:53] <yugnip> when you right click you have the option to set as default
[16:53] <Steve132> If I open /lib/udev/rules.d/80-udisks.rules like http://www.securitybeacon.com/?p=1110 suggests, I see something else completely, something about disabling ide devices and floppies
[16:53] <yugnip> lessshaste, the option for default is there, just check the box
[16:53] <jrtappers> Can someone help, I rebooted after some commands and i've lost unity
[16:54] <kylescottmcgill> jrtappers: what were the commands?
[16:54] <lessshaste> yugnip, there isn't one.. I am in lubuntu which may make a difference

[16:55] <yugnip> lessshaste, should not matter, there should be a box when you choose open with that says use as default

[16:56] <Dj_FlyBy> would it be wise/easy/safe to "upgrade" a media/web server from 10.04 LTS to 12.04.1 LTS through the "Update Manager" ?
[16:56] <kylescottmcgill> lessshaste: was the Default options not in System Settings -> Details? alternatively you could sudo apt-get remove abiword
[16:57] <fogus> How do I find out what user bind9 is being started as by "service"?

=== ydnar_ is now known as ydnar
[16:58] <lessshaste> kylescottmcgill, systems setings doesn't have details
[16:58] <kylescottmcgill> Dj_FlyBy: i would back it up and sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade ; sudo do-release-upgrade
[16:58] <yugnip> lessshaste, see my screenshot and not where the cursor is http://imgur.com/dksGg
[16:58] <qhartman> fogus, as root or with sudo do "ps aux | grep bind" it will tell you what user is running the process.
[16:59] <kylescottmcgill> but fresh installs are always preferred (at least in my opinion)
[16:59] <qhartman> fogus, You can also look in the init scripts, it should be listed there.
[16:59] <RollinV2> anyone here have ubuntu running on the c7 chromebook? i have a few performance questions
[17:00] <Dj_FlyBy> kylescottmcgill: what would be the critical things to backup? I am assuming it won't delete my data... or is that wrong to assume
[17:00] <home-horim> hey, do you know any?
[17:00] <fogus> So, I'll go the init route.
[17:00] <home-horim> i can't burn the regular way
[17:00] <kylescottmcgill> lessshaste: oh right sorry :) you could try something on here : http://www.howtogeek.com/117709/how-to-change-your-default-applications-on-ubuntu-4-ways/
[17:00] <nearst> whats up
[17:01] <lessshaste> yugnip, I am looking at it
[17:01] <jrtappers> kylescottmcgill, I think its an X11 problem KDE is broken aswell
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[17:01] <home-horim> do you know where can i get help with a burning software that allows spaning?\
[17:01] <kylescottmcgill> Dj_FlyBy: i wouldnt think it would either, it would be safe to assume that your user data is safe, but i would back up your sites, mysql (if you use it) and your apache host file(s)
[17:02] <jrtappers> kylescottmcgill,  I have screenlets , wallpaper and desktop icons
[17:02] <WeThePeople> when i drag and drop a icon from /usr/share/applications the icon doesnt show up on my desktop..??
[17:02] <kylescottmcgill> jrtappers: did it go into Fallback mode?

=== ppetraki is now known as ppetraki-busy
[17:02] <jrtappers> I can run terminal and xchat
[17:03] <jrtappers> so how can I fix this problem?
[17:03] <kylescottmcgill> hmmm, wierd... thats all you need? isnt it :)
[17:03] <kylescottmcgill> if Unity wont install i would check your .desktop files
[17:03] <kylescottmcgill> hang on i will find the path
[17:03] <atlef> home-horim, there is diskspan,
[17:03] <philinux> home-horim: i think k3b can do it not sure about brasero
=== Administrator is now known as Guest36481
[17:03] <fogus> qhartman: where in the init script is the username?  I see that "bind" is mentioned, so I changed the ownership to bind:bind, but that didn't help.
[17:03] <jrtappers> no, unity is installed, just not working
[17:03] <jrtappers> same with KDE, so it may be X11 to blaim
[17:03] <yugnip> lessshaste, i just checked and it works with thunar and pacmanfm as well as nautilus
[17:04] <lessshaste> ok thanks
=== seednode_ is now known as seednode
[17:04] <lessshaste> yugnip, not in archive manager it seems
[17:04] <lessshaste> yugnip, which doesn't have such an option
[17:04] <lessshaste> gnome archive manager that is
[17:04] <kylescottmcgill> jrtappers: i would check your these files to make sure they are set correctly, locate .session
[17:04] <yugnip> lessshaste, opeing an archive is different than a word file
[17:05] <Safa_[A_boy]> I loved ubuntu for phones ^_^
[17:05] <lessshaste> yugnip, right but the word file is in the zip in this particular case
[17:05] <lessshaste> yugnip, so I am opening the word file
[17:05] <kylescottmcgill> .xsession-errors should have errors in it relating to your unity and KDE not apprearing properly too
[17:05] <yugnip> lessshaste, you can choose which archiver to open an archive, OR you could choose which app to open a word file
[17:05] <jrtappers> kylescottmcgill, where is that?
[17:05] <Safa_[A_boy]> is there a way for translating it?
[17:05] <yugnip> lessshaste, in either case you must right click that specific file
[17:06] <lessshaste> yugnip, right.. a) when in gmail I have no option it just opens abiword.. if I choose the download as zip option from gmail it gives me archive manager then
[17:06] <kylescottmcgill> ~/.xsession-errors
[17:06] <kylescottmcgill> so
[17:06] <kylescottmcgill> less ~/.xsession-errors
[17:06] <lessshaste> I just need to change the defaults in lubuntu somehow
=== sburjan_ is now known as sburjan`
[17:07] <yugnip> lessshaste, download the file, unzip it, right click and make default changes, then from now on it will be as you chose
[17:07] <kylescottmcgill> lessshaste: sudo update-alternatives –config editor then after you have made your changes, sudo update-alternatives –all
[17:07] <kylescottmcgill> if yugnip's suggestion doesnt work
[17:07] <atlef> home-horim, or dar "disk archive"

[17:10] <fogus> qhartman: the init.d/bind9 file sets root:bind for the pid file, so I thought I would try that also
[17:10] <lessshaste> yugnip, sure but I still want to change the defaults :) I will ask on askubuntu
[17:10] <yugnip> lessshaste, it's the proper way to do it as the terminal config is harder than necessary if you arent used to it
[17:10] <lessshaste> I am only used to the terminal!
[17:11] <jrtappers> kylescottmcgill, how?
[17:11] <yugnip> lessshaste, you are changing the defaults when you click set as default

[17:11] <qhartman> fogus, that's a good idea. You will also need to make sure the permissions are right, not just the ownership. Look at the permissions on the pid file and set the log file the same
[17:11] <jrtappers> No browser
[17:11] <jrtappers> I have xchat and terminal

[17:15] <n0yd> Anyone currently using cairo-dock on 12.10? Im having an issue with autohide that I cannot get passed. Tried xfce, tried, gnome, it happens regardless of DE.
[17:15] <kylescottmcgill> sudo ln -s /usr/lib/path/to/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/
[17:15] <nearst> hmm. i think ubuntu main repo must be joking. replace stable apps with buggy one
[17:16] <n0yd> When I set cairo-dock to autohide, it doesnt come back on mouseover, unless I happen to mouseover the exact area where the foregound applications icon would be.
[17:16] <qhartman> fogus, and when you checked it after setting those permissions it showed "rwxrwxrwx"?
[17:16] <fogus> yes
[17:16] <fogus> same error
[17:16] <n0yd> If I mouseover in that exact spot, the dock will come back, otherwise  it stays hidden.
[17:16] <qhartman> fogus, try 770 instead
[17:17] <kylescottmcgill> jrtappers: after that, type: unity --reset ; unity --replace; and logout and login if it doesnt appear

[17:17] <jrtappers> how do I logout from terminal
[17:18] <n0yd> Damn, I figured no one would have a clue about cairo-dock, oh well, worth a shot.
[17:18] <qhartman> fogus, it's also possible the permissions on the log directory aren't set correctly

[17:25] <kylescottmcgill> nearst: are you on or near the eeepc now? i dont know if there would be a error log for that
[17:25] <ZenMasta> kylescottmcgill the flashing happened after using the desktop ui, even before the screen started flashing it was having some graphical anomalies, especially when trying to open the dashboard launcher thing. At first it looked like it froze but then it just showed the terminal and all those errors but I couldn't' seem to "get out" so I could type any new commands or anything
[17:25] <nearst> im on eeepc now
[17:25] <kylescottmcgill> it could be a incorrect xrandr setting, like the hsync is off or it could be gfx drivers, it could really be a million things :S

[17:26] <kylescottmcgill> ZenMasta: you could try nomodeset on the grub boot line, or seeing if you have some newer drivers, if you can google, try googling your GFX card and ubuntu flashing
[17:27] <Dj_FlyBy> kylescottmcgill: thanks for the info. Ill do a backup of all critical stuff before going ahead with it then. better safe than sorry
[17:27] <Muphrid> i3ear: you have to boot from a burned cd which has no relation to usb at all
[17:27] <nearst> i3ear, maybe your usb not properly booting setup, maybe bios

[17:30] <kylescottmcgill> jrtappers: http://goo.gl/yQkuj

[17:39] <jhutchins_wk> ZenMasta: They're probably trying to tell you what is wrong so you can try to fix it.

[18:36] <ElysiumNet> what is the best way to copy a machine?
[18:36] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet: rsync
[18:37] <mrmcgibby> kylescottmcgill: But it won't actually.  The other processes will still want to write to the deleted file.
[18:37] <nearst> use remastersys and make your own iso and install anywhere :)
[18:37] <ElysiumNet> tflgen2: entirely
[18:37] <kylescottmcgill> Sach: sorry these are command line commands, if you using the file manager to get there, just copy those to another location and try open them in Tomboy or Libre Office
[18:37] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet: or clonezilla. what are you trying to do?
[18:37] <ElysiumNet> mysql database, nginx settings, user permissions, etc
[18:37] <ElysiumNet> I am trying to get my production server to another production server :P
=== Guest88590 is now known as AndreUbuntu
[18:38] <ElysiumNet> with the least amount of disruption possible. this means not stopping services
[18:38] <kylescottmcgill> mrmcgibby: so, when you open a terminal and sudo rm .xsession-errors ; what does it say?
[18:38] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet: you should have no trouble rsyncing everything as root between the systems. the only issue is some db's that may not be correctly copied
[18:38] <losplaya_> im behind a home router will that make a difference
[18:38] <mrmcgibby> kylescottmcgill: It's deleted.  But lsof shows (correctly) that a bunch of other processes still using the old file.
[18:38] <ElysiumNet> tflgen2: wouldn't that set the permissions of everyone to root?
[18:38] <ElysiumNet> *everything
[18:39] <ElysiumNet> I am fine with copying the database seperately at the last minute
[18:39] <bekks> mrmcgibby: It will be released after the last file handle is released.
[18:39] <ElysiumNet> but wouldn't copying /etc/ cause problems?
[18:39] <rypervenche> tflgen2: You may have problems with InnoDB tables, yeah.
[18:39] <bekks> mrmcgibby: Until then, it is still there, but not accessible anymore for new processes.
[18:39] <mrmcgibby> bekks: but it's huge and it doesn't look like the processes are going to release it anytime soon.
[18:39] <rypervenche> tflgen2: I would just dump the databases then reimport them.
[18:39] <kylescottmcgill> mrmcgibby: as bekks said, also when you logout and login that file will be recreated
[18:39] <kylescottmcgill> how big was the file?
[18:40] <mrmcgibby> bekks and kylescottmcgill: I'd rather figure out how to make the file zero size.
[18:40] <ElysiumNet> rypervenche: mysql user data...
[18:40] <kylescottmcgill> mrmcgibby: those errors are there for a reason
[18:40] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Full_System_Backup_with_rsync
[18:40] <bekks> mrmcgibby: Release all file handles, and it will be gone.
[18:40] <nearst> zero size?
[18:40] <kylescottmcgill> mrmcgibby: but if you REALLLY dont want it
[18:40] <rypervenche> ElysiumNet: So dump all the databases at once then.
[18:41] <kylescottmcgill> ln -s /dev/null .xsession-errors
[18:41] <mrmcgibby> Okay, figured it out.  You can access a deleted file by using /proc/<pid>/fd/<fd>.  So if I just do # > /proc/2026/fd/2 it clears out the file./
[18:41] <ElysiumNet> rypervenche: *user data*. this includes passwords and such
[18:41] <ElysiumNet> which requires something else to dump and import properly
[18:41] <ElysiumNet> but I'll figure that out later

[18:42] <m1r0> Hello?
[18:42] <callie> hi m1r0
[18:42] <kylescottmcgill> mrmcgibby: im curious to know how large that file actually was
[18:42] <mrmcgibby> kylescottmcgill: 126 G
[18:43] <kylescottmcgill> lol
[18:43] <m1r0> I am having trouble installing ubuntu, although ubuntu (says it installs successfully), and it is on the hard disk, it is not being written to mbr, so my computer is booting straight to windows
[18:43] <kylescottmcgill> you know
[18:43] <m1r0> My computer has two harddisks, and ubuntu is being installed on the second one
[18:43] <kylescottmcgill> it should rotate
[18:43] <callie> m1r0, have you seelcted the boot loader drive during the install?
[18:43] <kylescottmcgill> and then delete itself after a couple of logins etc
[18:43] <mrmcgibby> kylescottmcgill: probably
[18:44] <mrmcgibby> kylescottmcgill: indicator-weather was going crazy and writing to it at about 1mb/s
[18:44] <m1r0> Callie: Here's the situation
[18:44] <m1r0> I had an older version of ubuntu dualbooting with windows on this computer
[18:44] <m1r0> then the grub got corrupted
[18:44] <ElysiumNet> rypervenche: that does not include user data...
[18:44] <m1r0> so I told windows to fix mbr and boot directly into windows
[18:44] <ElysiumNet> tflgen2: that article specificly omits /etc/
[18:45] <m1r0> now, I'm trying to update ubuntu, so I tell the installer to update
[18:45] <tflgen2> no it doesn't. it excludes /dev
[18:45] <ElysiumNet> er, nevermind
[18:45] <ElysiumNet> I thought that said --include
[18:45] <m1r0> (I've also tried to tell it to erase existing ubuntu and reinstall), but it's not installing the bootloader (GRUB)
[18:45] <tflgen2> ^.^
[18:45] <kylescottmcgill> m1r0: you need to change the boot order, if you installed grub on to the second disk
[18:45] <kylescottmcgill> by default your BIOS will use the first boot drive which would be windows
[18:45] <bones_> hi
[18:45] <callie> m1r0, you have to chroot from a livecd, and install grub from there
[18:45] <rypervenche> ElysiumNet: What exactly do you mean when you say user data?
[18:45] <bekks> mrmcgibby: Why didnt you stop indicator-weather then...?
[18:45] <m1r0> How do I do that?
[18:45] <ElysiumNet> rypervenche: username
[18:45] <ElysiumNet> and password, permissions, etc
[18:46] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet:
[18:46] <rypervenche> ElysiumNet: Of what? The database users?
[18:46] <ElysiumNet> last time I did an export/import of that data, it ended in ruins
[18:46] <m1r0> I'm going to see if bios lets me specify a hard drive to boot from
[18:46] <Guest15336> hello friends
[18:46] <tflgen2> whoops. password and user are kept in /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow for local users
[18:46] <ElysiumNet> rypervenche: one does not just export/import the "mysql" database -_-
[18:46] <ElysiumNet> tflgen2: different thing :P
[18:46] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet: gotcha
[18:46] <rypervenche> ElysiumNet: You can, but it may not be what you want.
[18:47] <ElysiumNet> rypervenche: percona probably has what I need
[18:47] <kylescottmcgill> ElysiumNet: you can do a mysql-dump of all dbs and then mysql-admin to import them again
[18:47] <abgeek> www.geeknepal #join for technology news and tutorials
[18:47] <ElysiumNet> kylescottmcgill: completely different thing >_<
[18:47] <callie> m1r0, you want to read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing#Reinstalling_GRUB_2 to install grub back on the first drive

[18:52] <nearst> why m1r0
[18:54] <guest414561> Can any one tell me what the best partition scheme would be for a 250G HD
[18:55] <bekks> guest414561: There is no such "best" scheme. It all depends on your needs, requirements and wishes.
[18:56] <guest414561> i want to be able to reinstall without losing media and settings
[18:56] <bekks> guest414561: Just backup everything before.
[18:56] <nearst> use side by side while installation
[18:57] <bazhang> guest414561, use a separate home partition, for starters
=== jan is now known as Guest12784
[18:58] <coyotekid> I'm trying to install a driver and new to Ubuntu. Used "source" command but it doesn't seem to be recognized. Is there another I should use?
[18:58] <jrtappers> Swap
[18:59] <jrtappers> Swap, Home, /
[18:59] <bekks> coyotekid: What exactly are you trying?
[18:59] <coyotekid> . setup is working.
[18:59] <coyotekid> but I get an alert that i need to be root and it quits.
[19:00] <bekks> coyotekid: What is ". setup" supposed to do?
[19:00] <coyotekid> and when I sudo then dot isn't working, for some reason.
[19:00] <bekks> coyotekid: And which Ubuntu do you have exactly?
[19:00] <coyotekid> dot setup, that should have read. dot setup is working. setup is my script.
[19:00] <bekks> coyotekid: do you want to source it or do you want to execute it?
[19:00] <coyotekid> it's a script to install drivers for a kodak scanner.
[19:01] <guest414561> I was reading the below link but it does not seem to give size recommendations http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/requirements.html#number
[19:01] <Pici> coyotekid: source is a shell built-in, its not an executable program.
[19:01] <bekks> coyotekid: And which Ubuntu do you have exactly?
[19:01] <coyotekid> I thought dot and source were the same?
[19:01] <coyotekid> for running a bash script?
[19:01] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: They are, but "./foo.sh" is different from ". foo.sh"
[19:01] <Pici> coyotekid: its not the command to run a bash script, its more like 'including' it.
[19:01] <bekks> coyotekid: No. Run a script like "./script" and source it like ". ./script"
[19:01] <coyotekid> it's the recent stable unbuntu.
[19:02] <Guest12784> hi, i'm trying to install Ubuntu via USB stick, but I'm having some trouble
[19:02] <coyotekid> I'm not using it with the slash, as a locater.
[19:02] <Guest12784> I've tried converting the desktop image via http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-mac-osx, and also just using netboot/boot.img.gz. However, each time the usb is not recognized as a option during boot. I've tried booting it on a Mac and a PC. Any thoughts on what could be the matter?
[19:02] <coyotekid> I'm using it as an abreviated source, which isn't working.
[19:02] <coyotekid> but dot "is".
[19:02] <coyotekid> but not when sudo.
[19:03] <bekks> coyotekid: Sourcing is not executing a script.
=== niek is now known as Guest52176
[19:03] <rypervenche> coyotekid: What is the exact command that you're trying to run?
[19:03] <coyotekid> I'm in the dir with a script called "setup".
[19:03] <coyotekid> when I run ". setup" is works, but tells me I need to be root.
[19:04] <coyotekid> then when I sudo it no longer works.
[19:04] <bekks> ". setup" does NOT run that script.
[19:04] <Pici> coyotekid: 'source' has the side effect of running the code, but thats not what it is for.
[19:04] <coyotekid> well, actually, it does.
[19:04] <bekks> "./setup" will, ". setup" wont.
[19:04] <coyotekid> I get all the info from Kodak, along with info about what drivers will install.
[19:05] <coyotekid> but then it says I need to be root and says hit enter to quit.
[19:05] <Pici> coyotekid: use: sudo ./setup
[19:05] <coyotekid> I've read dot is the same as "source" in a unix book. Are you saying that's wrong?
[19:05] <Pici> coyotekid: no.
[19:06] <Pici> coyotekid: but its not the proper way to run a script.
[19:06] <rypervenche> coyotekid: I believe that you are confusing what "source" does.
[19:06] <coyotekid> it was my Bash book, by O'reilly, if I'm not mistaking.
[19:06] <rypervenche> coyotekid: . is short for source, yes. But . can also mean "the current working directory".
=== b_bonner_ is now known as b_bonner
[19:07] <coyotekid> I'll try with the ./ but that just seems like I'm saying where the setup file is.
[19:07] <coyotekid> which doesn't say execute, like dot does.
[19:07] <ElysiumNet> tflgen2: I have noticed that if I do an rsync of /etc/, it will also copy over the ip configuration and software RAID stuff...
[19:07] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: You still need to either be root or use sudo.
[19:07]  * rypervenche facepalms.
[19:07] <coyotekid> or source, if in fact they're one and the same.
[19:07] <ElysiumNet> is that a good thing?
[19:07] <Pici> coyotekid: YOu need to look at your book again.
[19:07] <rypervenche> coyotekid: "source" does nat mean execute.
[19:08] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet:
[19:08] <rypervenche> not*
[19:08] <bekks> coyotekid: They arent the same, and ". " is not the proper way to run a script.
[19:08] <coyotekid> so when in sudo . is being read as here. But when not in sudo it seems to be read as source. That makes sense.
[19:08] <tflgen2> damnnit i hate this irc client….. ip configuration will have to be edited as will fstab
[19:08] <rypervenche> coyotekid: Simply typing out the path to your setup script will execute it.
[19:08] <ElysiumNet> any other files I need to be aware of?
[19:08] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: Giving the path to an executable file *does* say that you want to execute it. Try giving the full path to any executable in the shell.
[19:09] <ElysiumNet> also, the partitions are far larger than on the source machine. I imagine this would screw up the software RAID a bit
[19:09] <tflgen2> you'll also have to install the boot loader on the second machine
[19:09] <nearst> tflgen2, u can use manually setup than dhcp
[19:09] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: The only exception is where the directory is not specified, where the shell then looks for the executable in all of the directories in $PATH.
[19:09] <ElysiumNet> tflgen2: doesn't it already have a boot loader?
[19:09] <tflgen2> ElysiumNet: is it a bare system? i.e. no OS?
[19:09] <rypervenche> coyotekid: You can run "sudo ./setup" or "sudo /home/username/Downloads/setup", either will work. (assuming what's where your script is located)
[19:09] <ElysiumNet> tflgen2: I'm rsyncing to it... I'm pretty sure an OS has to be installed already
[19:09] <ElysiumNet> but yeah, ubuntu is already installed on it
[19:09] <tflgen2> nope, not necessary
[19:10] <rypervenche> coyotekid: "source" is something completely different. Do not focus on that.
[19:10] <ElysiumNet> rsycing over the network
[19:10] <coyotekid> the bash book says to run a script run source. The has a asterisk and says "you can also use the synonymous command dot (.).
=== chiluk_away is now known as chiluk
[19:10] <coyotekid> that's read right from the book.
[19:10] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: You'll notice that "sudo source setup.sh" will fail in exactly the same way as "sudo . setup", and both are equally wrong in this case.
[19:10] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: It might be helpful to read the bash manpage entry for "source".
[19:10] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: You are not understanding what the bash book means to tell you.
[19:11] <rypervenche> coyotekid: Then you're either misreading or you've got a bad book.
[19:11] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: You are also confusing commands and paths.
[19:11] <tflgen2> "For GRUB, it's recommended that you automatically re-generate the grub.cfg file:" i.e. #update-grub
[19:11] <kubanc> is there any software similar to CPanel for ubuntu server
[19:11] <coyotekid> "Source executes the commands in the specified file..."
[19:11] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: source setup will search your path for a program named setup.
[19:11] <coyotekid> Maybe this O'reilly book is wrong.
[19:12] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: No, just your understanding of it.
[19:12] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: What coyotekid just told you is wrong.
[19:12] <coyotekid> I'm not confusing paths. dot has multiple uses.
[19:12] <padi999> hi all
[19:12] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: The dot by itself does not specify a path.
[19:12] <padi999> Is anyone in here into fotography/filming and has a gopro hero 3?
[19:12] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: ./ does specify a path, the current directory.
[19:13] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: Sorry, what jhutchins_wk just told you is wrong. source does not search $PATH.
[19:13] <coyotekid> No, what I wrote in quotes was quoted from the O'Reilly book.
=== Guest98080 is now known as jbache
[19:13] <rypervenche> coyotekid: Let's get you a better guide then.
[19:13] <jhutchins_wk> Jordan_U: Quoting the manpage, " If filename does not contain a slash, file
[19:13] <jhutchins_wk>               names in PATH are used to find the directory containing filename."
[19:13] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: It executes the commands in the file in the current shell, which is not what you want, and is not what is generally meant by "executing a script".
[19:13] <coyotekid> both dot and source have both worked for me up until now. INterchangably.
[19:14] <coyotekid> The only problem I think here is that I'm trying to use it as an argument to sudo.
[19:14] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: That is just a coincidence.
[19:14] <Jordan_U> jhutchins_wk: I stand corrected, sorry. Still I would find it odd to use source that way.
[19:14] <Pici> coyotekid: that definitely won't work for something that isn't a bash script though.
[19:14] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: If the setup file is executable, sudo ./setup will work.  If not, sudo bash ./setup
[19:15] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: Try not to let what you have done before prevent you from learning what is correct.
[19:15] <coyotekid> It's not an executable, I'm trying to run a bash script.
[19:15] <GunArm> which release made unity standard?
[19:16] <jhutchins_wk> coyotekid: A bash script may be executable.  Not AN executable, we're talking about permissions in this case.
[19:16] <Jordan_U> coyotekid: A bash script is an executable file (at least when it has execute permissions).
[19:16] <coyotekid> Maybe I'm confused. I'll just mess with it. I don't usually work outside of bash. I'm now messing with a local Ubuntu install for the first time.

[19:28] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: You bought a device that only has manuals in French and Russian?
[19:28] <Jordan_U> !nomodeset | aring
[19:28] <ubottu> aring: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[19:28] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, there should be more languages, wait.
[19:28] <superdmp> Jordan_U:  if you have some suggestion on how what to do about this issue, *given that I am not in a position to update the system*, that would be greatly appreciated
[19:29] <superdmp> more so than an interrogation about why I can't update it right now
[19:29] <aring> I'll try that and let you know if it works, thanks.  :)
[19:29] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, http://files.syabas.com/popcornhour/download/PopcornHour_C-200_UserGuide.pdf
[19:29] <jhutchins_wk> superdmp: What I was asking is what is the source of the file you're trying to install?   Is it an official Ubuntu repository, a mirror, a ppd?
[19:30] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: I was obliquely suggesting that you might readn the manual, but I'll have a look, not doing anything else right now.
[19:31] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, sorry. yes i've read it when i set it up and it "should" be samba. i have no problems reaching it, i can reach it from this computer as well.
[19:32] <dada9293> ciao
[19:32] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, i'm not sure how the manual could help me with mounting so i would really appreciate your help.

[19:32] <ZenMasta> kylescottmcgill didn't have any luck with recover mode but I ended up downloading and isntalling all the latest updates, and changing the driver. seems to be running fine for the last hour
[19:32] <nearst> cool.
[19:34] <superdmp> jhutchins_wk: well, this is my sources.list file: http://dpaste.com/862206/
[19:34] <superdmp> should I find some other information to answer your question?
[19:35] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: So you have external storage attached to the device and have shared a folder on that device which you are trying to mount.   You may not have correctly set it up as a samba share.
[19:35] <kylescottmcgill> ZenMasta: sorry we couldnt get it sorted without you having to go through all of that, im glad it works now though :)
[19:35] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, no it's not external, it's a internal sata drive which i've connected internally in the popcorn hour.
[19:37] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: 7.1.2 of the manual.
[19:37] <Timvde> I have just installed Ubuntu, but: 1) My touchpad scrolling doesn't work; 2) Windows 8 wasn't detected, so I can't boot to it anymore...
[19:37] <nearst> why?
[19:38] <jhutchins_wk> superdmp: You'll have to use a different paste service, I can't reach that one.  Got a very suspicious site instead.

[19:43] <superdmp> jhutchins_wk: by the way, what was the issue with dpaste.com?
[19:43] <jhutchins_wk> superdmp: Enterprise Firewall probably.
[19:44] <bakis_> nearst: it's saying max is 800x600
[19:44] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, there is no problem reaching it through Nautilus at "smb://pch-c200/share/"

[19:44] <Sove> this is getting ridiculous, this linux machine here keeps getting file system errors in sda1
[19:44] <nearst> ya. i having the same issue atm bakis_
[19:45] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, If I look at the settings interface on the Popcorn hour the SAMBA client is up and running.
[19:45] <Sove> I already fixed it yesterday, but now it's back
[19:45] <Sove> I'm not really in the mood to keep fixing it everyday
[19:45] <Jordan_U> Sove: Have you checked the SMART status of the drive? What type of errors (do you have a log from fsck)?
[19:45] <Sove> Need the commands
[19:45] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, i've looked up the ip-adress for the device if it's any help.
[19:46] <Sove> I'm not exactly savvy with linux stuff
[19:46] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: You might be able to browse it with smb://<server> but cifs doesn't think it's a samba share.
[19:46] <bakis_> nearst: are you also using nvidia prop drivers?
[19:46] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, how do we change cifs mind? :)
[19:46] <superdmp> jhutchins_wk:  output from aptitude update: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1492896/ - that doesn't look right to me, with all those errors
[19:47] <jhutchins_wk> Sove: File system errors are not normal.  What errors?  We can't tell you how to fix it without knowing the errors. You can use the history command to see what commands you used yesterday.
[19:48] <Jordan_U> Sove: sudo apt-get install smartmontools && sudo smartctl -a /dev/sda
[19:48] <Sove> Yesterday I just used fcsk
[19:48] <Sove> It said sda1 had errors
[19:48] <aring> Alright, I tried running the livecd with nomodeset.  It got to a prompt (ubuntu@ubuntu) and i could input a few commands (ls, pwd, etc).  It then tried to run something else, I believe it might have tried to launch to GUI, however it just went to a black screen.
[19:49] <Sove> I used the live CD to get it fixed with sudo fcsk.ext3 -f /dev/sda1
[19:49] <nearst> bakis_, nope, im on intel gm915
[19:49] <jhutchins_wk> Sove: Not knowing what you might have done to damage the filesystem errors showing up a second time usually means that the life of the drive is very limited.
[19:49] <Noskcaj> to run steam in ubuntu do i need 12.04 or can the non-lts build run it fine?
[19:49] <bakis_> nearst: weird. is anyone else having this issue?
[19:49] <jhutchins_wk> Sove: You might have two weeks, you might have two days, you might have two minutes.
[19:49] <Sove> I didn't do anything to it
[19:49] <jhutchins_wk> Sove: In that case the physical drive is dying.
[19:50] <Jordan_U> Sove: Please pastebin the output of the command I gave, and if you get the corruption again please pastebin the full output from fsck.
[19:50] <jhutchins_wk> I suppose there's a chance it's a loose cable or something but continuing corruption is a hardware problem.
[19:50] <nearst> bakis_, so my max now is 800x600 :) . what can i do. make font small. lol

[19:51] <Jordan_U> jhutchins_wk: It could be the somewhat spurious error from fsck that many are experiencing that appears to be caused by upstarted failing to properly unmount filesystems at shutdown: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1073433

[19:54] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, I found this thread http://www.networkedmediatank.com/showthread.php?tid=14940 and tried "sudo mount -t nfs -o noauto,rsize=32768,wsize=32768,noatime,tcp 192.168.1.177:/share /mnt/popcorn" but it's the same error.
[19:54] <bakis_> so.. be right back
[19:55] <Jordan_U> jhutchins_wk: Indeed. It doesn't actually corrupt anything, but it shows that upstart is failing at a basic requirement of an init system (at least if the current theory on the cause is correct).
[19:55] <ElysiumNet> should I get 12.04 or 12.10?

[19:57] <reprogr`> hi
=== reprogr` is now known as `r3code`
[19:57] <Jordan_U> ElysiumNet: Then you'll probably be happier with Ubuntu 12.04 as it's an LTS release. If you stick with LTS releases then you can upgrade once every ~2 years, as you can go directly from one LTS release to the next and they are supported for longer.
[19:58] <aring> I can't seem to get ubuntu to install on my new laptop.  nomodeset got me farther, but it still didn't work.

[19:58] <ismell> ello, i'
[19:58] <Anunaki> i just installed ubuntu 12.10 gnome via wubi. bluetooth isnt working...
[19:58] <h00k> !lts | ElysiumNet this may have more info
[19:58] <ubottu> ElysiumNet this may have more info: LTS means Long Term Support. LTS versions of Ubuntu will be supported for 3 years on the desktop, and 5 years on the server; with the exception of 12.04 (Precise Pangolin), which will be supported for 5 years on the desktop. The current LTS version of Ubuntu is !Precise (Precise Pangolin 12.04)
[19:59] <Jordan_U> Anunaki: I highly recommend against using Wubi, though that's almost certainly not the cause of your bluetooth problems.
[19:59] <ismell> i'm running 12.04. How do i get the alt+f2 key combination to open the run dialog? everything I find seems to be about 11.10.
[19:59] <jhutchins_wk> Sove: This problem is being actively worked.  You could try installing 12.04 instead of 12.10.  One suggested workaround is to shut down networking manually before shutting down/rebooting the system.
[20:00] <jhutchins_wk> Sove: As Jordan_U said, it's a "cosmetic" bug - there really isn't anything wrong with the actual filesystem, it was just not shut down properly.
[20:00] <ismell> I tried installing ccsm but I can't change the run dialog key
[20:00] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, i installed nfs-common and it seems that i reached further, new error message: "sudo apt-get install nfs-common "
[20:00] <Jordan_U> jhutchins_wk: We don't know that that is the problem Sove is having until we get the output from fsck.
[20:00] <blackline> sorry jhutchins_wk, the error was: "mount.nfs: access denied by server while mounting 192.168.1.177:/share"
[20:01] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: Ah, well, a bit confusing that it gave "wrong filesystem type" before, but now it's permissions/credentials.
[20:01] <jhutchins_wk> I'm not scoring very well this afternoon.

[20:34] <yugnip> zyngawow, stick with it.

[20:35] <Jisawesome2> I have a problem with my wireless card, it can find the network ok, and it supposedly connects. however, it does not actually connect, and can not access the internet. When I do try to access the internet, it disconnects, and regardless of whether I try to or not, it disconnects after about 60 seconds anyway.
[20:35] <zyngawow> I guess it is hardware issue... My specs are: proc: i3 530 gpu: Sapphire Radeon hd7770 RAM: G.Skill Ripjaws CL7 8gb mobo: Shitty HP
[20:36] <yugnip> zyngawow, have you updated? and try to be more specific about the trouble
[20:37] <llutz> blackline: are you sure "credentials" is a valid mount-option for nfs?
[20:37] <zyngawow> Well.. for a start, when I installed Ubuntu, WiFi didnt work. Now it works sometimes.. Also, it says something like I dont have a hardware rendering taking place..
[20:37] <zyngawow> I guess that has to do with the low smoothness
[20:38] <blackline> llutz dont know so i changed to: username and password
[20:38] <llutz> blackline: since when does nfs use username/password?
[20:39] <llutz> blackline: those are cifs options
[20:39] <user_> d
[20:39] <Jordan_U> zyngawow: Indeed. Ubuntu 12.10 uses compiz and Unity3D even when there is no GPU accelleration, which means that all of the effects and compositing are done on the CPU, which will be very slow (and will take up CPU that could be used for other things).
[20:39] <Noskcaj> what changes do i have to make to run ubuntu 12.10 run well on an ssd (ocz vector 240gb), i have a 1tb hard drive as well
=== lewq_ is now known as lewq
[20:39] <blackline> llutz - ok. as you see i'm a bit confused ;)
[20:39] <zyngawow> Jordan_U: Oh, I also get a message seying compiz has crashed every while
[20:40] <Jordan_U> Noskcaj: None really. Depending on the drive it might help to run fstrim every once in a while.
[20:40] <zyngawow> And on additional drivers, the ATI driver is there
[20:41] <zyngawow> So.. why is Ubuntu using CPU for rendering?
[20:41] <jhutchins_wk> Noskcaj: You might want to do logging and temp files on the HD to reduce traffic on the ssd.
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[20:41] <Noskcaj> jhutchins_wk, ok, i was about to ask about that
[20:41] <adamk> zyngawow: Being listed there isn't enough.  Are the additional drivers 'activated'?
[20:42] <zyngawow> adamk, how would I know? I remember it had a green icon near it
[20:42] <zyngawow> I was using the x.org ones
[20:42] <blackline> llutz, you have any idea how to proceed? maybe i should start from scratch. i'm trying to mount a shared folder from my popcorn hour (media center) which have support for both SAMBA and NFS. I've already tried SAMBA with help from jhutchins_wk but we didn
[20:42] <blackline> didnt solve it that way.-
[20:42] <adamk> zyngawow: The open source drivers have limited acceleration for HD7xxx GPUs.  The proprietary drivers, available via the additional driver dialog, have 2D and 3D acceleration.
[20:43] <JoAnneThrax> Is there a different channel to ask specifically about using multiple monitors in ubuntu?  I'm trying to get my laptop to use one external monitor via HDMI and another via sVGA, but when I have the HDMI plugged in, the sVGA monitor doesn't work.  In amdcccle it's just greyed out...
[20:43] <zyngawow> adamk, so ATI drivers arent good?
[20:44] <llutz> blackline: doest "showmount -e 1.2.3.4"  (1.2.3.4 = ip of your mediacenter) show any shares?
[20:44] <jhutchins_wk> zyngawow: Some are, some aren't.
[20:44] <jhutchins_wk> zyngawow: Just like in Windows.
[20:44] <adamk> zyngawow: Again, the open source drivers have limited acceleration.  The proprietary drivers should work well.
[20:45] <zyngawow> I know they arent good on windows, but at least they accelerate
[20:45] <zyngawow> I'll try with the propietary

[20:46] <zyngawow> I already did lol
[20:46] <jrtappers> zyngawow, try additional drivers
[20:46] <jrtappers> zyngawow,  if you search on the dash for "Additional Drivers" it should appear
[20:46] <jrtappers> If you install it you usually get better performance
[20:47] <jhutchins_wk> llutz: Why the wierd mountpoint?
[20:47] <jrtappers> I just got a flood warning for no reason
[20:48] <llutz> jhutchins_wk: whats wierd with /mnt?
[20:48] <blackline> llutz, hmm. i sent that text line and it just shows a blinking box instead of the place i usually write stuff in terminal :p
[20:48] <jhutchins_wk> llutz: Oh, that's the share.

[20:52] <ares_> Hello, how to change monitor heartz on ubuntu 12.04LTS
[20:52] <llutz> blackline: after issuing the command, did you get back the prompt?
[20:52] <WeThePeople> would( ubuntu, windows, ubuntu ) be ok for a hdd?
[20:53] <magik_> WeThePeople, I think you can only have 4 main partitions but I'm a newb lol
[20:53] <WeThePeople> magik_, thats true primary parts.
[20:53] <blackline> llutz now it timed out, took a long while
[20:53] <llutz> blackline: you have to replace 1.2.3.4 by the mediacenter-IP
[20:54] <jhutchins_wk> blackline: Yeah, Popcorn Hour, PH.
[20:54] <ares_> ubuntu 12 kills me
[20:54] <jrtappers> ares_, why?
[20:55] <jhutchins_wk> llutz: I wouldn't expect NFS to use the real path as a sharename.
[20:55] <jrtappers> if its the window manager then install another window manager
[20:55] <ares_> <jrtappers> I can't change heartz on it like on 11 or 10
[20:55] <ares_> It was able to change it at display options
[20:55] <blackline> jhutchins_wk, i suppose they have some kind of support. but i'm kind of unsure about how i should explain the issue since I can reach the samba share from within my desktop enviroment.
[20:56] <llutz> jhutchins_wk: nfs has no "sharenames" like cifs, the share is listed by "showmount"
[20:56] <blackline> llutz, of course, i wrote the the media center ip the first try ;)
[20:56] <phillustine> q

[20:58] <ares_> if you want to change refresh rate use sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
[20:58] <ddilinger> if you wanted to file a bug that some package does not include a tool from the source ditsribution (say, there is an optional tool in the package called debugclient), is ubuntu-bug appropriate?
[20:59] <ares_> Linux For the win!
[21:00] <llutz> blackline: really ".... while mounting 192.168.1.177"?
[21:01] <llutz> blackline: there should be 192.168.1.177:/opt/blabla  <- the exported sharename
[21:03] <mcrawfor> so, how do I figure out whether compiz is using my graphics card? how do I even choose a graphics card. my xorg.conf is hilariously tiny compared to how i used to remember them
[21:03] <mcrawfor> is there some nice tool i need to know about in 12.10?
[21:03] <blackline> llutz, sorry. this is the full lenght: "marcus@Marcus:/mnt$ sudo mount -t nfs 192.168.1.177:/opt/sybhttpd/localhost.drives/SATA_DISK /mnt/popcorn

[21:04] <CloudGuy> hi
[21:04] <CloudGuy> what is the openvz package in ubuntu 12.04 ?
[21:04] <CloudGuy> the openvz kernel i mean
[21:06] <magik_> If it weren't for the need to use Windows once in awhile for games and certain applications,  I would discard it all together.  Right now I'm using Ubuntu 12.10 Quantal and it's working really good I'm quite impressed.
[21:06] <jhutchins_wk> mcrawfor: If compiz is displaying something it's using your graphics card.  Do you have more than one that you want to choose from?  Most systems run with no xorg.conf at all these days, it autodetects.

[21:47] <TvL2386> F3Speech, single disk performance that is... I'd go for a RAID5 setup of 3 disks (got myself 6*1.5TB in RAID5)... Online extendable with mdadm if you get a new disk and online filesystem resizable with resize2fs (EXT2,3,4)
[21:47] <xibalba> pozo, thats for a home desktop though right? not production
[21:47] <pozo> But that's for long term storage, not something you need fast disks for
[21:47] <xibalba> TvL2386, never do a raid 5 on 3 disks if you want any sort of usable performance

[21:51] <F3Speech> xibalba: willdo thanks for the suggestion
[21:51] <jackarg> question: if installing ubuntu on mac, should I erase os x or dual boot with it?
[21:51] <nearst> NuSuey, owh. mount -o bind /dev, sys, proc. then chroot
[21:51] <xibalba> F3Speech, two projects you'll be intersted in www.freenas.org, www.pfsense.org (both freebsd based)
[21:52] <medo> help    help help help help anyyyyyyyyyyyyy heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelp!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
[21:52] <IncogTop> If i boot the system up with a drive connected over esata itll freeze the system
[21:53] <F3Speech> so the final group view is i should just mount 1 drive and use the other for /home or something
[21:53] <xibalba> medo, what's your queef?
[21:53] <IncogTop> remove boots up....plug the drive back in or power it back on and it will work just fine until the drive "sleeps"
[21:53] <medo> when i am clicked on Dash home computer go hanged !!
[21:53] <TvL2386> F3Speech, you have 2*37GB right... Why should /home be on a different disk?
[21:54] <nickalex> rajaniemi.freenode.net
[21:54] <Jordan_U> medo: Theatrics won't get you more support, it will however annoy the people you're trying to get free support from, which is less than productive.
[21:54] <xibalba> Jordan_U, why not help instead of typing your rant?
=== Guest79218 is now known as Chex
[21:54] <F3Speech> TvL2386: someone said with on 2 disks raid is just extra hassle when i dont need the performance
[21:54] <jhutchins_wk> IncogTop: That suggests a bad connection.  Either something's wrong with the cable/connector or something's wrong with the drive.
[21:55] <IncogTop> jhutchins_wk, neither
[21:55] <Jordan_U> xibalba: Because I don't know how to help with xibalba's isaue, if I did I would have responded to their original question.
[21:55] <TvL2386> F3Speech, RAID is always a hassle... :) It's indeed easier to have 1 disk as your root filesystem and the other mounted in /home. But that does not divide the space
[21:55] <F3Speech> TvL2386: i have to agree why have a car that can go 300mph if you can only drive at 100mph :)
[21:55] <tromas> HI ve
[21:55] <medo> what can i do i asked this qu more and more
[21:55] <tromas> Hi everybody,
[21:55] <xibalba> medo,
[21:55] <xibalba> repeat it
[21:55] <IncogTop> TvL2386, mdadm seems nice enough
[21:55] <tromas> I have a problem with nvidia optimus. I want to disable it
[21:55] <jhutchins_wk> F3Speech: You won't get performance increases without hardware raid.
[21:55] <xibalba> i'll give you info if i can medo
[21:55] <IncogTop> atleast for raid1
[21:55] <tromas> how can I do it?
[21:56] <IncogTop> oh for performance increase?
[21:56] <medo> when i am clicked on Dash home computer go hanged !!
[21:56] <IncogTop> yea
[21:56] <xibalba> jhutchins_wk, not even read performance?
[21:56] <IncogTop> need hardware raid then
[21:56] <F3Speech> jhutchins_wk: none? wasnt aware of that
[21:56] <jhutchins_wk> xibalba: Not measurable.
[21:56] <xibalba> medo, first make sue you're fully up2date w/apt-get update/upgrade
[21:56] <IncogTop> you can get some performance with raid0
=== jonas_ is now known as Guest9177
[21:56] <IncogTop> but i wouldnt suggest that
[21:56] <TvL2386> F3Speech, You can also take a look at LVM. Maybe this will give you the flexibility you would like
[21:56] <medo> i did it
[21:56] <xibalba> LVM is garbage, dont use it
[21:56] <IncogTop> raid5 is good but you need atleast 3 drives for that and at that point a real hardware raid card ( note hardware raid...not HBA or some silly intergrated mess )
[21:56] <F3Speech> yeah
[21:57] <medo> it's up to dat
[21:57] <xibalba> IncogTop, dont suggest RAID5 w/3 drives man
[21:57] <xibalba> that's Disk I/O 101
[21:57] <IncogTop> xibalba, i see no problems with raid5 with 3 disks
[21:57] <IncogTop> its the bare minimum
[21:57] <IncogTop> but it works fine
[21:57] <xibalba> its awful, especially on 1.5 TB drives...if you had to rebuild that yo'll probably end up with 2 drive failures
[21:57] <xibalba> 'fine' it does not work like
[21:58] <IncogTop> xibalba, if this was mission critcal yes id agree
[21:58] <Jordan_U> IncogTop: You can certainly get performance benefits from software RAID, as long as the bottleneck is IO rather than CPU.
[21:58] <Guest9177> Dell OptiPlex 7010 MT standard pieces and ubuntu 12.04 install. LAN is not working stable. What can we do?
[21:58] <IncogTop> then id say raid6 with a bunch of drives
[21:58] <TvL2386> IncogTop, xibalba my homeserver started with raid5 3 disks (1.5TB Samsung ecogreen 5200RPM)... Did about 200MB/s... It evolved into 6*1.5 TB... Slowly extending and resizing... It's very good!
[21:58] <IncogTop> but this isnt mission critical
[21:58] <IncogTop> and raid isnt backup
[21:58] <IncogTop> just redundancy for that little extra protection
[21:59] <IncogTop> you should always have a backup of a backup
[21:59] <jackarg> can someone answer me?
[21:59] <xibalba> IncogTop, ha dont i know it. we have our backup backing up to backup #2
[21:59] <xibalba> using FreeNAS though
[21:59] <jhutchins_wk> RAID really just provides more modes and points of failure.  Unless you need a bigger partition than the largest physical drive it's not worth it.
[21:59] <bs123> does FreeNas use samba?
[21:59] <xibalba> bs123, yes
[21:59] <bs123> thought so
[21:59] <jhutchins_wk> jackarg: Sorry, don't see a question.
[21:59] <xibalba> and apple , NFS, rsync
[22:00] <IncogTop> as for my issue it seems to be an issue where it just times out
[22:00] <bs123> had it setup a few years ago
[22:00] <IncogTop> on "softreset"
[22:00] <F3Speech> jhut you think LVM is the best opting then just to make the space accessible or would you mount them seprate with /home etc
[22:00] <xibalba> alright i need to go before i frusterate myself
[22:00] <xibalba> F3Speech, lvm is garbage stay away
[22:00] <nearst> lol
[22:00] <Guest9177> does anyone know why a LAN connection is not stable on an Optiplex built by Dell
[22:00] <jhutchins_wk> !patience > mego
[22:00] <IncogTop> dell
[22:01] <F3Speech> lol come on guys, help a poor guy out stop disagreeing lol
[22:01] <TvL2386> you all say the correct things... But if someone just wants a simple fileserver at home where performance is not really a big issue and you just want a mountpoint that's able to provide lots of terabytes that can easily be extended.... Go for raid5 mdadm and choose a fs that is online extendible
[22:01] <IncogTop> theres your issue
[22:01] <IncogTop> mdadm is nice
[22:01] <Guest9177> is there a standard fix or system check I can do?
[22:01] <Jordan_U> jackarg: It's probably best to keep OSX to be able to do firmware updates.
[22:01] <NuSuey> nearst: so.. im booted to the usb.. so what should I do? :(
[22:02] <IncogTop> grr
[22:02] <Jordan_U> Guest9177: Ethernet?
[22:02] <Grizly> Guest9177: ethtool?
[22:02] <Guest9177> Ethernet yes
[22:02] <medo> i am sorry every one for annoying ,and thank you sallam !
[22:02] <jackarg> Jordan_U: now something else I wanna know. what are firmware updates?
[22:02] <Guest9177> what does ethtool exactly do?
[22:03] <Jordan_U> Guest9177: What type of stability problems specifically?
[22:03] <Guest9177> There is a connection failure randomly
[22:03] <TvL2386> and yeah yeah.... redundancy or backups withing the same system (or building) is not a real backup. When you get robbed or your server closet burns out (been there!), it's gone
[22:03] <Guest9177> other PCs can get access and with same cable a laptop. too
[22:04] <Jordan_U> jackarg: Firmware is code stored in your hardware.
[22:04] <Guest9177> Only Optiplex has problems
[22:04] <jhutchins_wk> jackarg: If you get rid of OSX you won't be able to do firmware updates, that's about the only thing you loose.
[22:04]  * ElysiumNet sighs at software raid
[22:04] <ElysiumNet> why the hell does it keep trying to read from the obviously broken disk
[22:04] <ElysiumNet> instead of the disk that still works
[22:04] <jackarg> jhutchins_wk: I'm still unsure of the advantage firmware updates give you
[22:05] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, remove the broken disk and reboot? It would see a degraded array but won't have issues???? (taking a guess here, please proceed with caution!)
[22:05] <jhutchins_wk> Nice!  A demonstration of exactly what I was saying: RAID is more trouble than it's worth!
[22:05] <ElysiumNet> TvL2386: you would think a software raid wouldn't be *that* stupid
[22:05] <nearst> agree
[22:05] <ElysiumNet> "Oh hey, this disk is broken! LET'S BREAK IT SOME MORE!"
[22:06] <IncogTop> :|
[22:06] <ElysiumNet> while making the box nearly unusable by throwing iowait pikes
[22:06] <ElysiumNet> *spikes
[22:06] <bingoringo> if I want to set the default program for opening video files, do I need to set that for each filetype individually?
[22:06] <nearst> fsck?
[22:06] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, well, since it's software, I would guess it may have issues with hardware failures. The disk is not shielded from the OS as when it would be in a hardware raid
[22:06] <ElysiumNet> I thought it should do, "Hey, this sector is unreadable. Better use the other harddrive instead"
[22:07] <jhutchins_wk> Let's see, in November we lost both the drive that had the array configuration on it and the backup battery on the controller.  In December we lost a drive and the array went RO.  Reseated the drive and it came right back, then failed again the next day.
[22:07] <ElysiumNet> TvL2386: disk 2 so far hasn't even been touched for a single read. it's only been written to
[22:08] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, raid doesn't give you that kind of integrity... It just provides you with the data in case of a complete disk failure
[22:08] <ares_> Is possible to always keep on desktop selected display setting (resulution and refresh rate) Now after reloging or restart my display settings randomizes
[22:08] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, if one disks fails slowly... that will cause lots of issues
[22:08] <jackarg> Jordan_U: what advantage do firmware updates give you?
[22:08] <ElysiumNet> TvL2386: ...it would be a rather basic thing to implement for a software raid?
[22:08] <ElysiumNet> "Hey, this sector is hard to read and screws up the box. let's not"
[22:09] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, but unfortunately it seems it doesn't work that way :-)
[22:09] <ElysiumNet> shouldn't I be able to just remove it with mdadm while the machine keeps running?
[22:09] <Guest9177> how can I find out whether the connection fails due to hardware or software?
[22:09] <ElysiumNet> TvL2386: I so wish it did
[22:10] <jhutchins_wk> Guest9177: Try a different port on the switch.  What chipset is the system using?
[22:10] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, I'm hesitant to advise you anything, because I don't wanna be held accountable for screwing up your data, but I would turn it off, disconnect the broken disk. That way it can't cause issues for sure

[22:12] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, if you want self healing, use a FS like zfs: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZFS#Data_Integrity
[22:12] <TvL2386> ElysiumNet, good luck! I have to leave now

[22:17] <jhutchins_wk> jak2000: Why not just aptitude install mysql-server?
[22:17] <jak2000> dkessel: sudo dpkg -i ?
[22:17] <nearst> yup.
[22:17] <jak2000> jhutchins_wk but install the lastes mysql version?
[22:17] <dkessel> jak2000, sudo dpkg -i installed it
[22:18] <rscent> hi, can anyone help me?
[22:18] <jhutchins_wk> jak2000: I believe you need the -server package, and if you use the one provided by ubuntu you know it's properly integrated with the system.
[22:18] <jhutchins_wk> jak2000: Latest version means latest bugs.

[22:24] <magik_> ares_, I don't think you can do that but you can make it hide.
[22:24] <nearst> try backup as iso?
[22:25] <ares_> on 11 ubuntu version there was in setting Starting programs or smth like that. Where is it now?
[22:26] <magik_> ares_, I think it's because they switched to tthe Unity instead of GNOME.
[22:26] <danny_> how do i add folders to the left side of the file browser along with the home documents and that stuff
[22:26] <ares_> I will remove unity bar and replace it with gnome bar

[22:31] <magik_> you need to be out of workspace
[22:31] <nearst> del workspace ?
[22:32] <magik_> so type cd
[22:32] <magik_> then type sudo rm -r /workspace/
[22:32] <kristenbb> magik_ I cded into the *parent of* workspace
[22:32] <F3Speech> parent of workspace is out of it :) wouldnt that delete /workspace from the root
[22:33] <magik_> is the directory empty or full?
[22:33] <kristenbb> empty
[22:33] <magik_> then just rmdir /workspace
[22:33] <kristenbb> same error
[22:33] <F3Speech> parent of workspace is out of it :) wouldnt that delete /workspace from the rootjust workspace
[22:34] <F3Speech> woops
[22:34] <magik_> ok, reboot into a shell instead of GUI and try it that way
[22:34] <F3Speech> its just workspace not /workspace

[22:35] <AndreUbubtu> Hi people, my laptop webcam seems to work randomly (rarely) - mostly it doesnt. When I try to load up guvcview i get an error. A strange thing is that the webcam is shifting from /dev/video0 to /dev/video1....When I try to start guvcview on the new device path, it shifts back to the old path /dev/video0...and keeps doing this all the time. The webcam (HP TrueVision HD) seems to be detected, but every cam program gives the same error [libv4l2:
[22:35] <AndreUbubtu> error turning on stream: No such device] - I really need to get this sorted :(
[22:35] <F3Speech> so int eh parent of of workspace you typed "sudo rmdir workspace" and it failed?
[22:35] <kristenbb> magik_: there's no need to reboot, it's not in the system disk. it's a external usb disk.
[22:35] <F3Speech> you have the case right
[22:36] <F3Speech> ah could be permissions on the mount
[22:36] <kristenbb> F3Speech: yes that's right.
[22:36] <kristenbb> I mean
[22:36] <magik_> could be what F3Speech  said or you could need to format it.
[22:36] <kristenbb> F3Speech: yes that's right, I tried int eh parent of of workspace you typed "sudo rmdir workspace" and it failed?
[22:36] <nearst> ...
[22:37] <F3Speech> do you give a uid when mounting the drive?
[22:37] <imbezol> so i was doing a release upgrade from 11.10 to 12.04 and ran into a problem half way through... i hit z to enter a shell and compare two files. i hit ctrl-c to abort something i was doing in the shell and it aborted the upgrade process

[22:37] <nearst> imbezol, try apt-get --fix-missing
[22:37] <magik_> kristenbb, It could be what F3Speech said and be permissions on the mount or you may just have to reformat because from the parent directory typing sudo rmdir workspace should work.
[22:37] <kristenbb> F3Speech: but I can delete other files in the disk
[22:37] <imbezol> i ended up with the screen session getting killed off and a dpkg process was running in the background.. had to kill it to remove the lock.
[22:38] <Jordan_U> nashant: What log and what errors specifically?
[22:38] <kristenbb> magik_: I know it should work, that's why I found it weird and came here for help.
[22:38] <Gyro54> How do I change the Enter Key function? I need to change it from CR to CR/LF
[22:38] <Jordan_U> imbezol: Do *not* kill the dpkg process, at least not yet. It's likely completing important steps.
[22:38] <magik_> kristenbb, try unmount and remount if that don't work backup your data and reformat the drive.
[22:38] <imbezol> Jordan_U: i had to as it had a bash -i hanging off it and i had no way to get to it

[22:45] <kristenbb> Muphrid: yes
[22:45] <Roubles> Hi I tried to make a bootable usb of 12.04 with unetbootin, but when I boot up my computer I get an error "ERROR: No configuration file found. No DEFAULT or UI configuration directive found! boot: "
[22:45] <imbezol> is there a way to resume a failed do-release-upgrade ?
[22:45] <Roubles> ^ Is this a problem with mini.iso ?
[22:45] <kristenbb> Muphrid: well, that I know of. But at least some others are not having the same issue.
[22:45] <nashant> The announcement about Ubuntu Mobile is awesome, can't wait for that!
[22:45] <F3Speech> Roubles: if your pc quite old?
[22:45] <Muphrid> kristenbb: is seems that particular file is corrupted or does not exist anymore, by that error
[22:46] <Roubles> F3Speech: It is.
[22:46] <magik_> kristenbb, better backup your data from the drive and reformat
[22:46] <Jordan_U> imbezol: Have you done "sudo dpkg --configure -a" yet?
[22:46] <celeroninuse> I actually had to physcially switch off the system
[22:46] <kristenbb> Muphrid: could be, wouldn't it end up in lost+found though in that case ?
[22:46] <imbezol> Jordan_U: that doesn't do anything
[22:46] <Roubles> F3Speech: That's why I am trying to use the mini.iso, because of PAE processor incompatibility.
[22:46] <F3Speech> Roubles: could be your usb boot is usb-zup not usb-hdd and your pc wont boot from live image format
[22:46] <Muphrid> kristenbb: not that i know of, have you tried to F5 the main dir?
[22:47] <F3Speech> Roubles: usb-zip i ment
[22:47] <Jordan_U> imbezol: Good, then you don't have further packages to configure. What about "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"?
[22:47] <kristenbb> Muphrid: well yeah in the sense that I unmounted and remounted it.
[22:47] <Gyro54> celeroninuse: I have a 12.04 which locks up when playing from website music. Not sure why
[22:47] <F3Speech> Roubles: i just had the exact same problem
[22:47] <celeroninuse> Gyro54: Well its dissapointing for a LTS
[22:47] <imbezol> Jordan_U: same as "aptitude full-upgrade". it wants to pull in a tonne of X stuff
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[22:47] <Roubles> F3Speech: In the BIOS boot options I see USB HDD listed at the top.
[22:47] <imbezol> Jordan_U: lists 249 new packages to be installed
[22:47] <Jordan_U> Roubles: What system did you try to make it from? That sounds like a syslinux error, maybe because you used a system with an old and incompatable version of syslinux.
[22:48] <mikubuntu_> whats the address for the photo(bin?) site?
[22:48] <Roubles> Jordan_U: I made it with ubuntu 10.something or 11.something.
[22:48] <Aperol> hello folks
[22:48] <Gyro54> celeroninuse: It is 1 x desktop and I think I will just kill the whole machine and reinstall.
[22:48] <mikubuntu_> whats the address for the photo(bin?) site?
[22:49] <Aperol> no dont do that u can use the reset-function (start cmd and type "idiotami")
[22:49] <Fenaralan> how do I remove a zombie procsess?
[22:49] <Aperol> the adress is photoadr.ess
[22:49] <Gyro54> How do I change the Enter Key function? I need to change it from CR to CR/LF
[22:49] <Aperol> dunno eat its brain
[22:49] <Aperol> press t and then the new key
[22:49] <DJones> Aperol: Do you have an Ubuntu support question
[22:49] <jhutchins_wk> Aperol: Please stop.
[22:50] <Aperol> yes how do i turn it into mac?
[22:50] <celeroninuse> gyro54: Well I'm waiting for the next LTS. A hard lockup playing music and a few tabs isn't worth switching over for.
[22:50] <Fenaralan> how do I remove a zombie process?
[22:50] <Aperol> im waitin for the next std
[22:50] <Muphrid> kristenbb: and what if you actually refresh it by f5?
[22:50] <Aperol> not, dont
[22:50] <kristenbb>  Muphrid the folder is still there
[22:50] <Fenaralan> anyone can tell?
[22:51] <Jordan_U> Roubles: That's probably the problem then. You should be able to dd the iso to a USB drive (be very careful with dd though).
[22:51] <Slart> Gyro54: I think it might be easier to change a textfile from using CR to CR/LF than to change the actual result of pressing enter
[22:51] <mikubuntu_> Aperol, why did you lie to me.  I am here looking for help.
[22:51] <Aperol> ok sry
[22:51] <Fenaralan> anyone can help me?
[22:51] <Gyro54> celeroninuse: I think that unit is on 12.04.1 but I am not sure. I have 6 x others which have no problems. They don't play as much music though
[22:51] <Aperol> no
[22:51] <jhutchins_wk> Fenaralan: If kill -9 doesn't do it (it probably won't) the only cure is a reboot.
[22:51] <Fenaralan> yeah tried that
[22:51] <Fenaralan> wow
[22:51] <Fenaralan> i dont wanna reboot ;_;
[22:51] <Tex_Nick> !patience | Fenaralan
[22:51] <ubottu> Fenaralan: Don't feel ignored and repeat your question quickly; if nobody knows your answer, nobody will answer you. While you wait, try searching https://help.ubuntu.com or http://ubuntuforums.org or http://askubuntu.com/
[22:52] <Slart> Gyro54: this might be helpful http://askubuntu.com/questions/2392/re-mapping-keyboard-keys
[22:52] <jhutchins_wk> Fenaralan: Kinda by definition a zombie is unkillable.
[22:52] <Fenaralan> is it bad to leave it there?
[22:52] <Aperol> oh yes, sweet jesus! this hilarious support here is so giving me a boner!
[22:52] <Jordan_U> Fenaralan: Have you tried killing its parent?
[22:52] <Aperol> no
[22:52] <Fenaralan> yes
[22:52] <Fenaralan> ima pastebin
[22:52] <jhutchins_wk> Fenaralan: It's certainly not taking any CPU, might have some RAM but that's probably not critical.
[22:53] <Slart> Fenaralan: a zombie process doesn't use any resources afaik, I don't think you can get rid of them unless you reboot the machine (except in some special cases)
[22:53] <Gyro54> Slart: Thanks
[22:53] <mikubuntu_> DJones, user Aperol may pose a danger to other users who might follow his flip comments and damage a system.
[22:53] <Fenaralan> http://pastebin.com/G9xFyQv9
[22:53] <DJones> mikubuntu_: They're already gone
[22:53] <jhutchins_wk> mikubuntu_: He gone.
[22:53] <Fenaralan> oh
[22:53] <Fenaralan> well thats what i see
[22:54] <mikubuntu_> thx -- i hardly knew him
[22:54] <Slart> Gyro54: if you do decide to start messing with xmodmap make sure you read about it first.. there is no easy to way to just "restore things back to normal" apart from rebooting..
[22:54] <F3Speech> server file systems is there any particular that should be aimed for, im looking at ext3 as default but intrested on anyones views. thanks
[22:54] <Muphrid> kristenbb: is it showing in "ls -lih" and what is the size?
[22:54] <Miebster1> When I run the following command "ssh root@hostnmae 'bash -s' <shellscript.sh argument" it doesn't work because there is a line in the shellscript.sh that runs another shell script (located on the remote host) that contains a command that the local host doesn't recognize.  How can I execute the script on the remote host instead?
[22:55] <Roubles> Jordan_U: OK I will try that.
[22:55] <Slart> F3Speech: depends on what you're going to do with them.. some are better at big files, some are better at small files.. other have other advantages such as stability and security..
[22:55] <beboj_> need help:http://askubuntu.com/questions/235859/running-sierra-wireless-gobi-2000-under-ubuntu
[22:56] <F3Speech> Slart: i think ill be dealing with alot and fragmented traffic then shipping the end result out to nas
[22:56] <mikubuntu_> i'm having trouble with dvd playback -- want to post a pic of my screen, but i can't remember the 'photobin'  paste up address?
[22:56] <Slart> F3Speech: I would say that for general purpose ext3/ext4 is ok.. I've used xfs on some drives in my server but I didn't see any obvious differences
[22:56] <Roubles> Jordan_U: Just to be sure, it's the iso that I should dd to usb right? Not another file?
[22:56] <DJones> mikubuntu_: Try imagebin
[22:56] <kristenbb> Muphrid: well it's a folder so it doesn't really have a size, does it? But yeah it shows in ls -lih and the size shown is 8K
[22:57] <F3Speech> Slart: thanks
[22:57] <VlanX> anyone here with Intel 82571GB NIC?
[22:57] <mikubuntu_> DJones, thx -- i kept trying photobin couldn't remember
[22:57] <DJones> !imagebin | mikubuntu_
[22:57] <ubottu> mikubuntu_: Screenshots can be made with the [PrtScr] button. Want to show us a screenshot of your problem? Upload an image to http://imagebin.org/?page=add and post a link to it.
[22:57] <DJones> That was what I was trying to remember
[22:57] <Slart> F3Speech: have a look at the wikipedia articles for ext3, ext4, xfs and perhaps zfs if that is useful on ubuntu by now.. that should give you some idea about what there is to choose from
[22:57] <Jordan_U> Roubles: Correct.
[22:57] <Gyro54> Slart: The problem is due to Libreoffice with creating a CSV file to use on windows. LO only creates a CR where Windows creates a CR/LF. My file needs the LF
[22:58] <Slart> Gyro54: oh.. but surely that is a preference somewhere in libreoffice.. it has to be.. or you could just change it afterwards
[22:58] <Muphrid> kristenbb: 8K for an empty folder? you probably have deleted the files from there and did not empty the trash bin.
[22:58] <Slart> Gyro54: I would definately not mess with xmodmap for that..
[22:58] <kristenbb> Muphrid: 8k might be the block size.
[22:59] <Gyro54> Slart: The LO people have pointed to the OS
[22:59] <Muphrid> kristenbb: my empty folders are 6 bytes long, not 8k
[22:59] <Slart> !info tofrodos | Gyro54
[22:59] <ubottu> Gyro54: tofrodos (source: tofrodos): Converts DOS <-> Unix text files, alias tofromdos. In component main, is optional. Version 1.7.9.debian.1-1build1 (quantal), package size 20 kB, installed size 68 kB
[23:00] <Slart> Gyro54: that one might work, make sure you read the man page first
[23:00] <Gyro54> Slart: Thanks
[23:00] <Slart> Gyro54: are you using libreoffice writer or libreoffice calc to create the csv file?
[23:00] <Gyro54> Slart: LO Calc
[23:01] <mikubuntu_> http://imagebin.org/241612  can't get proper playback in any media player on my system.  i tried (re)installing libdvdread4 (and reboot), but still same prob as illustrated at imagebin link
[23:01] <Roubles> Jordan_U: It worked. :)
[23:01] <kristenbb> Muphrid: 6 bytes is not possible, no file system would store only 6 bytes, besides 6 bytes is not even enough to store the folder name and its attributes (time...)
[23:01] <Roubles> Jordan_U: At least the USB is booting now.

[23:04] <Jordan_U> mikubuntu_: Do you have that problem with all video files or just DVDs?

[23:06] <jak2000> i am type the corret password, need specify the user on the scp command?
[23:08] <AndreaUbuntu> I don't get the logic of a cam that works once out of the blue....but does not on X amount of restarts, then works again at some random point.....
[23:09] <Slart> AndreaUbuntu: might be the order in which kernel modules load, or some kind of racing condition ie doesn't work if the system mounts that harddrive before it checks for the cam driver
[23:09] <Gyro54> Slart: That is exactly the problem. I am thinking character set and will check what the other computer is set to. Thanks again
[23:09] <DaemonicApathy> jak2000: scp <file> <user>@<IP>:<path>
[23:09] <Slart> Gyro54: you're welcome, hope you get it figured out.. and shame on the libreoffice people for not having some kind of checkbox for file ending =)
[23:10] <AndreaUbuntu> Slart, I also dont get why my device keeps shifting from /dev/video0 to /dev/video1 and back when trying and re-trying guvcview
[23:10] <WeThePeople> how do i find out where the mysql db is running
[23:10] <nocturius> just to be sure.... there's no way to boot a LUKS root partition without an unencrypted /boot partition - right?
[23:10] <WeThePeople> to connect to
[23:10] <Gyro54> Slart: I am sure they will pick this up.
[23:11] <AndreaUbuntu> Slart, sometimes even goes up to /dev/video13....magically works a while, then doesnt work anymore
[23:12] <AndreaUbuntu> I really would love to avoid dualbooting/vm-ing into a Windows install just to make skype calls xD
[23:12] <Slart> AndreaUbuntu: webcams is closer to black magic than logic in my experience.. I'm just happy I don't have to use one for anything serious
[23:13] <AndreaUbuntu> Slart, ye....always had trouble setting them up....but usually it was just a skype problem needing a Preload or something.....but now its all over the system
[23:13] <jrtappers_> AndreaUbuntu, You have installed skype already on ubuntu?
[23:13] <AndreaUbuntu> jrtappers, yes it is installed
[23:13] <jrtappers_> ok
[23:14] <AndreaUbuntu> the system also sees my HP TrueVision HD cam....
[23:15] <Jordan_U> nocturius: It's possible to have /boot/ within LUKS, but it doesn't make much sense to do so.
[23:15] <AndreaUbuntu> but i get black screen on skype, as well as cheese etc. SOMETIMES the cam works after some restart.....and the device shifts from /dev/video0 to /dev/video1 and back and forth everytime a cam program is used......still....i get the same errors all over....
[23:15] <AndreaUbuntu> libv4l2: error turning on stream: No such device
[23:16] <AndreaUbuntu> it seems the device is found, but just cant be started up....then restart the system and 1/100 times it works :S
[23:16] <AndreaUbuntu> it's not even fair magic :)
[23:18] <AndreaUbuntu> i was reading somewhere it could be a serious issue with USB Bus speeds and kernels :S
[23:18] <AndreaUbuntu> which is quite a radical bug to solve
[23:21] <mikubuntu_> Jordan_U: sorry, got called away.  i haven't had any issues with web video, seems only with dvd that i know of ...
[23:21] <DJJeff> gpio_ich: failed to claim resource 0 http://pastie.org/5618577 should I be worried about this?

[23:23] <Jordan_U> AndreaUbuntu: Mostly a stab in the dark, but have you tried using a powered USB HUB?
[23:23] <mikubuntu_> Jordan_U: i don't really have any video files saved, usually just watch what is streamed my way
[23:23] <AndreaUbuntu> Jordan_U, what do u mean? this is an integrated webcam
[23:24] <mikubuntu_> Jordan_U: i have watched dvd's in the past, just not recently, but don't remember ever having similar issue
[23:25] <Jordan_U> AndreaUbuntu: Ignore that then. There was someone in here a few days ago who had problems with a USB connected camera and solved it by using a powered USB HUB. Though most internal webcams are still connected via USB, so if you have a lot of other USB devices connected that draw a lot of power it might be worth trying to disconnect some of them.
[23:26] <Jordan_U> mikubuntu_: Different applications use different APIs to get video to the screen, so my guess is that your problem is with your graphics drivers, and is not specific to DVDs but rather to whatever accelerated rendering your video player is trying to use.
[23:27] <AndreaUbuntu> Jordan_U, i've got my usb mouse....nothing else...PS cam is fine itself, since it works ok on Windows 7. However I do require a "thermal.off=1" kernel setting. Otherwise the fans never work...and trackpad/keyboard lock up.
[23:28] <dmdrummond> Is there a channel for discussing development for the new mobile platform?
[23:29] <AndreaUbuntu> i just unplugged my mouse, cam still wont work...replugged my mouse...and mouse aint working :S

[23:32] <mikubuntu_> Jordan_U: and the one other (also pesky) problem i have is that the system tray at the bottom of my screen sometimes comes on, and sometimes doesn't.  if i minimize an app, it goes somewhere, i guess, but it doesn't go into the tray
[23:32] <AndreaUbuntu> anonymous, have u tried turning it off and on again? :)
[23:32] <anonymous> That I have :D
[23:32] <AndreaUbuntu> haha
[23:32] <Mise00001> is it set to decimal or hex or other?
[23:33] <Mise00001> Is the issue with addition, division or some other operation? Which ones?
[23:33] <anonymous> Well, mostly multiplication.
[23:33] <Mise00001> Does it get all answers wrong or just some?
[23:33] <AndreaUbuntu> 2x2 != 4? :D
[23:33] <anonymous> Just some lol.
[23:33] <anonymous> Usually if it's a larger number.
[23:33] <AndreaUbuntu> example? ;D
[23:33] <Slart> anonymous: you will have to give us some examples
[23:33] <Mise00001> Can you give some examples?
[23:33] <anonymous> Alright. 20,000 X 10
[23:34] <anonymous> That's what, 200k?
[23:34] <AndreaUbuntu> what does it give?
[23:34] <anonymous> I get either 2 million
[23:34] <anonymous> Or 20 thousand
[23:34] <AndreaUbuntu> LOL

[23:35] <anonymous> Well, really depends. It changes from time to time.
[23:35] <anonymous> Sometimes I get 20,000
[23:35] <AndreaUbuntu> madness :D
[23:35] <anonymous> Sometimes I get 2 million.
[23:35] <rypervenche> nocturius: I use 100MiB, but that's overkill for what I need.

[23:35] <anonymous> Basic that's bundled with Ubuntu 12.10
[23:36] <AndreaUbuntu> any weird upgrades u did?:S

[23:36] <anonymous> LOL I promise I'm not, I'm in the banking industry I don't fail THAT much.

[23:39] <Stopp> ,
[23:40] <nocturius> oh, another question: does the choice between ext2/3/4 matter for /boot?
[23:40] <nocturius> with regard to robustness, mostly
[23:40] <anonymous> That's interesting.
[23:40] <anonymous> Isn't it 'galculator' to run from terminal?

[23:46] <AndreaUbuntu> why does stuff break so easily the newer distros get :S
[23:46] <rypervenche> AndreaUbuntu: They don't always. It depends on the distro.
[23:47] <AndreaUbuntu> I love ubuntu's interface....but man it was so much more solid around 10.10
[23:47] <seednode> My distro, although infamous for breaking easily, hasn't ever had issues for me
[23:47] <dr_willis> Non LTS releases are normally for testing new ideas and thus may be more unstable.

[23:48] <dr_willis> AndreaUbuntu:  or it just had some old logs that never got cleaned out.. so it kept reporting the same crash
[23:48] <AndreaUbuntu> alas, my webcam worked on 12.04 but not on 12.10 :S
[23:49] <dr_willis> That may be more of a kernel issue then a ubuntu issue.  But i rarely mess with webcams
[23:49] <AndreaUbuntu> dr_willis, yes, i think its kernel too
[23:49] <cnuulhu> Hey guys, I'm upgrading from a very old version of Ubuntu to 12.04 (LTS) using a fresh install. I'm familiar with using rsync -av on /home to back up user files and settings, but how do I restore from that backup after upgrading?
=== _dd is now known as Guest24277
[23:50] <Tex_Nick> best thing to do ... check the distro hardware compatibility ... then custom build the pc with compatible components
[23:50] <bekks> Just use rsync -av again.
[23:50] <AndreaUbuntu> dr_willis, old logs for a new install? :)
[23:50] <dr_willis> AndreaUbuntu:  ive seen where a single crash just gets reported over and over.. its easy to clean out apport/disable it.
[23:50] <AndreaUbuntu> I also love the changes to buttons etc on 12.10
[23:50] <cnuulhu> bekks: So, even without having to create new users or anything, just rsyncing with /home on the new system will create those new users for me?
[23:50] <AndreaUbuntu> can they be applied to 12.04?
[23:51] <cnuulhu> [Is my question clear?]
[23:51] <bekks> cnuulhu: No. rsync will recreate their files.
[23:51] <blami> cnuulhu: no
[23:51] <blami> cnuulhu: rsync just transfer their files
[23:51] <dr_willis> I alwyas am sure to add users on a new system, back in the same order. ;) but with 4 users.. thats easy to rember
[23:51] <cnuulhu> So, I re-add the new users, then rsync their home directories back in?
[23:52] <blami> dr_willis: that's why I use local ldap
[23:52] <bekks> A copy of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow willbe helpfull.
[23:52] <blami> dr_willis: just sync from backup ... I think it would be lot easier to migrate and manage systems if ubuntu came with that setup as default
[23:53] <bekks> blami: LDAP by default?:P
[23:53] <AndreaUbuntu> well good night my fellow ubuntusers
[23:53] <cnuulhu> bekks: So, syncing /home as well as /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow will be sufficient to re-add the previous users as well as their files?
[23:53] <bekks> cnuulhu: No.
[23:53] <bekks> cnuulhu: helpfull != sufficient
[23:54] <bekks> In addition with /etc/group these three files contain all necessary information to manually recreate the users.
[23:54] <blami> cnuulhu: I wouldn't do that ... rather note information about users and just recreate them with same uid gid and groups they belong to ...
[23:54] <blami> bekks: except passwords :)
[23:54] <bekks> blami: /etc/shadow ...
[23:54] <demondin> hi
[23:55] <cnuulhu> blami: Okay, that's easy enough. This is just a home desktop, everyone can re-enter their passwords as necessary.
[23:55] <Hiros> hello
[23:55] <blami> copying hashes by hand?
[23:55] <demondin> you guys obviously use ubuntu, right?
[23:55] <cnuulhu> Thank you all very much.
[23:55] <blami> bekks: I bet ordinary users wouldn't notice they are using local ldap, hm?
[23:55] <F3Speech> Having problems moving file system from usb to hdd, have moved file system, installed grub, updated, updated fsbab mounts. on reboot with usb still i can choose the new disk and it boots find no problems, however as soon as i remove my usb i appear to lose access to sudo etc and system starts chruning error about missing fs. any ideas how to finilise the fs transfer so i can remove my original usb.
[23:56] <demondin> i have a question about ubuntu
[23:57] <demondin> ello?
[23:57] <bekks> blami: local LDAP will not help you at all. You'll have to restore the LDAP config instead of three files only.
[23:58] <F3Speech> demondin: ask your question someone will answer if they know
[23:58] <demondin> okay
[23:58] <demondin> i want to install ubuntu on my older laptop (not really old) but im just worried about losing all the files...is that going to happen?
[23:58] <blami> bekks: it does. If you have reasonable configuration you just copy it over and then import original schema

[23:59] <blami> bekks: (and copy home directories) ... tada, everything done
[23:59] <blami> bekks: no need to fiddle with passwords, groups, etc.
[23:59] <bekks> blami: Which is the SAME effort as just recreating the users according to the three files.
[23:59] <F3Speech> demondin: short answer is yes, back them up first
[23:59] <blami> bekks: in case of 4 users, sure (but still I am lazy)
