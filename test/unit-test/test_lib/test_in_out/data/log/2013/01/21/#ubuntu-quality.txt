[12:19] <zyga> retoaded: ping
[12:20] <zyga> retoaded: would you mind adding another account for zyga, just like the one brendand has, in the jenkins instance at 10.97.5.22
[12:24] <zyga> retoaded: correction, just grant the necessary rights please, I've created an account already
[12:31] <smartboyhw> phillw, balloons or noskcaj: ping me when you are at your computer
[12:58] <phillw> smartboyhw: I'm lurking :)
[12:58] <smartboyhw> phillw, I wonder: Have you contacted pleia2 on the Ubuntu QA Classroom sessions? I can
[12:58] <smartboyhw> not see it on the calendar:P
[13:00] <phillw> smartboyhw: I haven't. Feel free to contact her with the details :)
[13:04] <smartboyhw> phillw, you better. Two days later is your session right?
[13:16] <phillw> let me have a look at the wiki
[13:16] <phillw> smartboyhw: yeah, mine are this Wed, so any time after that for your session :)
[13:36] <smartboyhw> phillw, didn't you receive the e-mail!?!?
[13:40] <phillw> smartboyhw: yes, have you updated the wiki page?
[13:41] <smartboyhw> phillw, no. Since I just decided it:P
[13:41] <smartboyhw> Haven't told the classroom guys
[13:50] <phillw> smartboyhw: okies :)
[14:15] <retoaded> zyga, done
[14:15] <zyga> roadmr: thanks!
[14:18] <roadmr> zyga: you're welcome :) but you meant retoaded ^^
[14:18] <retoaded> :D
[14:18] <zyga> roadmr: heh, yes, grr-tab
[14:18] <zyga> retoaded: could we install some plugins to jenkins>
[14:19] <retoaded> zyga, yes I can
[14:19] <retoaded> I thought brendand was going to give me a list this past Friday
[14:19] <zyga> yeah, but I could not remember any names
[14:19] <retoaded> np
[14:20] <brendand> retoaded, yeah i was trying to get names out of zyga, but he wasn't forthcoming ;)
[14:21] <retoaded> heh
[14:21] <zyga> I've googled for a few but it seems that one is already there
[14:21] <zyga> I'll try to set it up now
[14:21] <brendand> retoaded, really at that point it was more of a 'is this feasible' question
[14:21] <retoaded> brendand, no worries
[14:22] <retoaded> when you come up with the list just shoot me an Email with them and I'll get them added.
[14:23] <zyga> thanks

[16:21] <SergioMeneses> has anyone seen to Smarthboyhw?
[16:40] <micahg> SergioMeneses: quit about 1.25 hrs ago
[16:41] <SergioMeneses> micahg, thanks!
[16:41] <SergioMeneses> ill be here for a while
[16:42] <micahg> I think that's EOD for him
[17:13] <pleia2> phillw: can you please reply to my emails about the upcoming sessions? we really need notification a week out :( this last minute stuff makes it very hard for us to find volunteers and advertise
[17:14] <pleia2> it's too late to put it in UWN now, and I still don't have the prerequisites for any of the classes (do they need to download isos? which ones? anything else installed?)
