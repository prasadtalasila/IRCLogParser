[21:51] <FernandoMiguel> anybody else experiencing lots of slow downs and disk usage?
[22:02] <FernandoMiguel> Unpacking libtelepathy-logger3:amd64 (from .../libtelepathy-logger3_0.6.0-2~git1_amd64.deb) ...
[22:02] <FernandoMiguel> dpkg: error processing /var/cache/apt/archives/libtelepathy-logger3_0.6.0-2~git1_amd64.deb (--unpack):
[22:02] <FernandoMiguel>  trying to overwrite '/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libtelepathy-logger.so.3.2.0', which is also in package libtelepathy-logger2:amd64 0.6.0-1
[22:03] <dkessel> FernandoMiguel, there's a bug for that already
[22:03] <FernandoMiguel> cool
[22:03] <FernandoMiguel> just purging the packages for now, and will re-install ubuntu-desktop meta next week :)
[22:04] <dkessel> bug 1095745
[22:04] <ubottu> bug 1095745 in telepathy-logger (Ubuntu) "package libtelepathy-logger3 (not installed) failed to install/upgrade" [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1095745
[22:04] <dkessel> maybe you want to mark as "affects me"
[22:04] <FernandoMiguel> it should be quick fix
[22:04] <FernandoMiguel> no worries
[22:04] <FernandoMiguel> have more serious bugs to look after
[22:05] <FernandoMiguel> I don't even use empathy :)
[22:05] <FernandoMiguel> I would really really like to track down what's causing the imense disk usage and slow downs on my laptops
[22:05] <FernandoMiguel> it started on my work PC with a 7200 RPMs disk... but now, my home one with SSD is also being affected
[22:05] <FernandoMiguel> I have times I can't use anything, such is the IO.
[22:15] <bjsnider> fixing that is just a tweak to the control file
[22:22] <dkessel> bjsnider, go ahead :)
[22:23] <hggdh> FernandoMiguel: you can force the install with dpkg -i --force-overwrite
[22:24] <FernandoMiguel> hey hggdh, long time no see :) no worries. packages removed :D
[22:24] <hggdh> FernandoMiguel: one option is to install iotop, and monitor which program is hitting the disks
[22:24] <bjsnider> no thanks
[22:24] <hggdh> FernandoMiguel: long time indeed :-) and you have been rather quiet in -pt ;-)
[22:24] <FernandoMiguel> hggdh: iotop just shows disk flushes, jbsomething
[22:24] <hggdh> well, so am I
[22:25] <FernandoMiguel> I tend to close that tab :x
[22:25] <FernandoMiguel>   288 be/3 root        0.00 B/s   15.15 K/s  0.00 %  0.94 % [jbd2/sda5-8]
[22:25] <FernandoMiguel> something like this, but using 100%
[22:25] <FernandoMiguel> but disk writes are about 3MB/s max
[22:26] <hggdh> well, 15K/s is not that much
[22:26] <hggdh> ah
[22:26] <FernandoMiguel> it doesn't happen that often on my SSD device
[22:26] <FernandoMiguel> but on the rotatory one  I have it every hour or so
[22:27] <FernandoMiguel> something like updatedb will most certainly trigger it
[22:27] <hggdh> FernandoMiguel: that's the ext4 journal
[22:27] <FernandoMiguel> I figured
[22:27] <FernandoMiguel> could it be corrupted or full ?
[22:30] <FernandoMiguel> wasn't there a huge bug a while ago about kernel/ext4?
[22:32] <dkessel> the journal could get corrupted if you used some exotic, unsupported, mount options
[22:32] <FernandoMiguel> dkessel: all stock
[22:32] <FernandoMiguel> I'll try a fsck on it
[22:33] <FernandoMiguel> although I think I already did, a month ago....
[22:33] <FernandoMiguel> or mount it without journal...  I really really need to figure this out... can't use my machines....
[22:33] <FernandoMiguel> kernel .37 is worse than .35.... that much I know for sure. when it gets really bad I reboot to .35 and it doesn't happen that often
[22:36] <hggdh> well, you are not that bad. I cannot user 3.7.0-7 at all, bcmwl causes a kernel panic
[22:36] <FernandoMiguel> hggdh: I had that too for a while
[22:36] <FernandoMiguel> latest kernels seem to be okish
[22:36] <FernandoMiguel> assuming wifi card is enabled on boot
[22:36] <hggdh> not for me; I am stil on 3.7.0-5, and bcmwl 5
[22:43] <dkessel> has the command name for "restricted drivers" changes? i am missing jockey-gtk ... ?
[22:44] <hggdh> dkessel: yes, it is now under software-sources
[22:44] <hggdh> at least for a while
[22:49] <dkessel> hggdh, will bcmwl only cause a panic if i switch wifi on? because i need it too... what is the bug # for that?
[22:51] <dkessel> hggdh, nevermind. found it
