[00:03] <xbskid> Is there something I can get for Unity that gives me an expandable menu? For example, if I wanted to lock a 'Games' folder to the launcher, so when I click on it, it expands out from the launcher bar and gives me a list of games.

[00:08] <cub> i did, i didn't see anything about selecting text.. maybe i wasnt looking in the right place?

[00:13] <ActionParsnip> Transhumanist: if it relies on rpc in Windows,  you are ok
[00:14] <bobweaver> computer,  looks like that dude just install gnome-shell to get it all to work
[00:14] <donttrustem> Is this a special version http://www.ubuntu.com/certification/hardware/200908-3469/
[00:14] <Transhumanist> ActionParsnip: I figure they'll be targetting Windows. But it makes sense to me to investigate what I can do to ensure my Linux computers never become nodes in botnets. Cheers.
[00:15] <computer>  OK. Remove and install lightdm or not?
[00:15] <bobweaver> computer,  I would do that
[00:15]  * donttrustem is now confused... How can it be certified and not work on the hardware
[00:16] <bobweaver> computer,  I would also maybe install gnome-shell also  sudo apt-get install gnome-shell

[00:29] <HackinBlack> My laptop is new
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> Donttrustem: yes, remove quiet splash   and add those instead
[00:29] <dr_willis> HackinBlack:  and what do you mean by control? whats to control? How new is new? 2 days old? 2 months?
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> Hackinblack: newness is moot

[00:29] <ubottu> Your GUI file manager's Trash folder is located at ~/.local/share/Trash/ for files moved to trash from your hard disk and .../.Trash-userid/ on external devices for files moved to trash from the device.
[00:29] <ActionParsnip> Hackinblack: what is the output of: cat /etc/issue
[00:30] <HackinBlack> A couple months and just controll the fan sorta like how Hp coolsense works
[00:30] <HackinBlack> On windows

[00:32] <ActionParsnip> Hackinblack: so why ask when you have no way to try what we suggest
[00:32] <dr_willis> apt-get also supports TAB completion in ubuntu. ;)
[00:32] <MDKwlan> Really? I didn't know that dr_willis
[00:33] <ActionParsnip> Hackinblack: makes no sense at all. And to be so demanding to. You need to think before you type
[00:33] <MDKwlan> Learn something new every day I assume. Cheers.
[00:33] <dr_willis> tab is handy
[00:33] <ActionParsnip> Mdkwlan: always try tab, it does a lot
[00:33] <MDKwlan> Yea I use it for navagating files but I assumed that it didn't work for apt-get.

[00:37] <ActionParsnip> Madmantum: ask and see
[00:37] <tga> hey, does anyone know about mounting hfs volumes with uid set?

[00:37] <ubottu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions - For write access, see !NTFS-3g or !FUSE
[00:37] <tga> mount -o uid=1000 seems to ignore me, I still get the OS X uids
[00:37] <madmantm> when i pass the authentification, i get the blue lines wallpaper appear, and then i get my background
[00:37] <madmantm> each time
[00:39] <sylphie> madmantm \ what then is the issue?
[00:39] <madmantm> well, why is there a picture loading when i authenticate that is different from my own background
[00:39] <madmantm> sorry i might have not explained it correctly
[00:40] <donttrustem> ActionParsnip: Works perfectly... Now I have to add the line permantly how do I do this
[00:40] <sylphie> madmantm \ so that if you can't authenticate, your personal data won't be loaded
[00:40] <tga> ActionParsnip, afaict that link doesn't help much
[00:40] <madmantm> yes, i'm saying after i authenticate, for one or two seconds, i see that blue default wallpaper, and then it comes back to my own wallpaper
[00:41] <sylphie> madmantm \ it takes time to load your personal wallpaper, 2 seconds isn't terrible
[00:41] <tga> I am manually mounting a HFS partition with uid=1000 and I still get uids from the original system

[00:47] <ActionParsnip> Donttrustem: you will need to run:  sudo update-grub   to apply it permanently. This will not affect the install CD. It will work on an installed OS
[00:48] <sylphie> tga \ try "-r"
[00:48] <tga> sylphie, -r should be the same as -o ro
[00:49] <tga> and the result is the same, I still can't access the files
[00:49] <sylphie> uid of 1000 is the right one for the file ownership?
[00:50] <tga> uid=1000(tga) gid=1000(tga)
[00:51] <tga> I tried umask=0 alone and it didn't work either
[00:51] <jrib> tga: what filesystem?
[00:51] <tga> hfs
[00:51] <tga> hfs+ probably, os x standard
[00:51] <sylphie> when you are booted mac, is 1000 also your uid?
[00:51] <donttrustem> ActionParsnip: Wtf I edit the file reboot and get a black screen :(
[00:52] <tga> sylphie, of course not
[00:52] <jrib> tga: how do your files end up getting mounted?

[00:53] <tga> probably for the better, otherwise it would be even more confusing
[00:54] <sylphie> tga \ maybe you need to mount using the os10 uids?
[00:54] <tga> /dev/sde1 on /mnt/1 type hfsplus (ro,uid=1000,umask=0)

[01:05] <tga> jrib, even a permanent chown/chmod is out of the question since hfsplus is ro
[01:06] <jrib> tga: I can't tell you with certainty.  But I imagine it would be the same as accessing an ext4 volume as a user.  The user needs to have permission on it.  There might be a better solution, but I don't know; I don't use hfsplus at all

[01:46] <SuperFunkyFly> Ill pipe my traffic though a VPN and see if anything changes. Then Ill stuff port 53 for DNS into TOR or just change to opendns
[01:47] <SuperFunkyFly> My Debian host is acting fine.
[01:48] <julian-delphiki> SuperFunkyFly are they both using the same DNS servers?
[01:49] <SuperFunkyFly> No, when I think about it. My host computer is always using a DNS server though TOR. I dont like my ISP logging what I am doing.

[01:54] <julian-delphiki> Gomex, sorry, we can't support anything except ubuntu
[01:54] <Tex_Nick> Gomex : probably only your home folder
[01:55] <julian-delphiki> nitrousoxidus: can you put them both on the 5850?
[01:55] <nitrousoxidus> I can and it works but colling is better
[01:55] <nitrousoxidus> and linux doesnt have good power managment
[01:55] <julian-delphiki> "colling" ?

[01:55] <Gomex> julian-delphiki, I don't wanna support other distribution
[01:55] <Tex_Nick> Gomex : there is an archlinux channel that is usually very active ... #archlinux

[01:56] <nitrousoxidus> ah ok.Thanks cooling
[01:59] <nitrousoxidus> So any ideas.
[01:59] <julian-delphiki> I can't say I know how to do that, nitrousoxidus. People usually only use one display output type.

[02:00] <b1lly> I tried installing the nvidia drivers but nothing seems to work

[02:05] <BillyZane> san diego
[02:06] <BillyZane> how about you
[02:06] <b1lly> yeah so, i have no clue
[02:06] <b1lly> it says I have the latest nvidia drivers installed when i try to update them
[02:06] <b1lly> but then when I try to goto my nvidia settings
[02:06] <b1lly> i dont appear to using the nvidia x driver
[02:07] <MDKwlan> Alright I know this isn't ubuntu based question but I'll try anyway. So I have a choice between a tarball or a 32-bit deb file for a game. Which would you assume is better or are the just the same and I'm just a noob?
[02:07] <BillyZane> what's lower than a n00b
[02:08] <MDKwlan> Fr00b?
[02:08] <julian-delphiki> MDKwlan: if you are on ubuntu / debian based distro the deb will work
[02:08] <BillyZane> i'm a fr00b then cause i have no idea what you just said
[02:08] <BillyZane> i just got linux 2 days ago
[02:08] <MDKwlan> Well yea. I'm just asking is there really any differance between the two?
[02:08] <julian-delphiki> one will install on your system, one you will extract into a folder
[02:08] <BillyZane> sorry, can't help you. i'm on baby formula right now
[02:09] <BillyZane> i believe tar extracts to a folder
[02:09] <BillyZane> deb installs?
[02:09] <julian-delphiki> correct
[02:09] <BillyZane> well i learned something
[02:09] <MDKwlan> Yea I undertand this.
[02:09] <BillyZane> how do you use the deb command?
[02:09] <Idsi> Hello!
[02:09] <BillyZane> is it... deb (letters) file
[02:09] <BillyZane> letters being the jumper settings for the install
[02:10] <MDKwlan> its not that simple billy lol :P
[02:10] <MDKwlan> sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
[02:10] <BillyZane> well, i took a guess
[02:10] <BillyZane> sudo = super user do
[02:10] <MDKwlan> I know :D Just saying :P
[02:11] <BillyZane> dpkg , no clue what that is
[02:11] <MDKwlan> look at the man page and it will explain it ^.^
[02:11] <BillyZane> oh yeah, is there a manual online?
[02:11] <julian-delphiki> on your terminal
[02:11] <julian-delphiki> type
[02:11] <BillyZane> also....
[02:11] <julian-delphiki> man dpkg
[02:11] <MDKwlan> open terminal man dpkg
[02:11] <BillyZane> man dpkg?
[02:12] <BillyZane> ohhh.. hold on, i have a virtual box
[02:12] <BillyZane> but... guys
[02:12] <BillyZane> guys... i want to do a  legit ubuntu install, on its own partition
[02:12] <BillyZane> i have an install file on a USB drive
[02:12] <BillyZane> i want to know
[02:12] <julian-delphiki> I think you should keep using it in a VM for a while
[02:12] <MDKwlan> yea
[02:12] <BillyZane> ok :(
[02:12] <MDKwlan> Understand it in a vm a little more before installing stright up
[02:13] <MDKwlan> Its more of a safety net.
[02:13] <BillyZane> i suppose you're right
[02:13] <MDKwlan> I do that with arch and gentoo
[02:13] <julian-delphiki> and when you do install, just check out wubi
[02:13] <BillyZane> lets say the safety net is not there, what would happen?
[02:13] <julian-delphiki> could lose / mess up your windows install
[02:13] <MDKwlan> Well if grup messes up you could be left with a nonbooting machine lol :P
[02:13] <BillyZane> umm... let me google everything you guys said
[02:13] <MDKwlan> which i mean is fixed easly
[02:14] <MDKwlan> grup? really grub
[02:14] <BillyZane> MDKwlan, but i would have a windows partition on the HDD
[02:14] <MDKwlan> No free space?
[02:14] <daftykins> BillyZane: the point is, if you're not very familiar with installing Ubuntu, you could stop Windows from booting.
[02:14] <BillyZane> umm... well, about 150gb for windows, i would alocate about 30 gb for the ubuntu drive and then give the rest to NTFS
[02:15] <BillyZane> daftykins, even if ubuntu is on its own drive?
[02:15] <b3nj> help, at command says "warning: commands will be executed using /bin/sh"
[02:15] <BillyZane> err... on its own partition
[02:15] <MDKwlan> you have to watch doing that. If it's within the windows tool for that it will be fine but i would do it with gparted.
[02:15] <BillyZane> one sec, i gotta google all the encrypted code words you guys use
[02:15] <daftykins> BillyZane: in a dualboot config yes
[02:15] <julian-delphiki> this guy seems like a troll
[02:16] <BillyZane> me?
[02:16] <julian-delphiki> yeah
[02:16] <BillyZane> no i just have a weird sense of humor
[02:16] <b3nj> help me, how to make at use /bin/bash instead of /bin/sh?
[02:16] <MDKwlan> I get lost sometimes. I think its windows that hates playing with linux. Like windows before linux not linux before windows.
[02:16] <Godel> My youtube videos have yellow dots in them. I am using Ubuntu 12.04. Chrome 24.0.1312.52. It started today. Any suggestions?
[02:16] <MDKwlan> type bash
[02:16] <b3nj> MDKwlan: in at command
[02:16] <BillyZane> julian-delphiki, i am legitely brand new to this though
[02:17] <BillyZane> i'm googling wubi
[02:17] <MDKwlan> Stick with a vm mate. Until you learn some more :P
[02:17] <BillyZane> ubuntu installer, is a windows based installer.. hmm... it installs on NTFS or on its own partition
[02:17] <b3nj> MDKwlan: i should just type bash in at and commands will be executed using bash?
[02:17] <daftykins> BillyZane: WUBI is a seriously, seriously bad idea.
[02:17] <BillyZane> ok
[02:17] <MDKwlan> Are you editing a script for sh?
[02:18] <BillyZane> i have no idea what i would be doing
[02:18] <julian-delphiki> wubi isnt a bad idea, it works, its just kind of easy to break
[02:18] <b3nj> MDKwlan: i mean at as a command
[02:18] <BillyZane> i have 2 computers
[02:18] <MDKwlan> Like ok I only ever see this with arch's chroot but do you see like sh 4.2 and not root@hostname?
=== Danausplexippus is now known as Idsi
[02:19] <BillyZane> i would technically use my second computer to come on here and ask questions during install?
[02:19] <daftykins> BillyZane: which Windows? does it fill the entire HDD right now?
[02:19] <BillyZane> it would be a painfully slow process, switching monitor,keyboard,mouse but at least it's faster than communications a few hundred years ago
[02:19] <BillyZane> daftykins, windows 7, it is on a 150gb partition
[02:19] <daftykins> BillyZane: so there's free space to put Ubuntu on already?
[02:19] <BillyZane> 1 tb hard drive
[02:20] <BillyZane> yes
[02:20] <daftykins> wow that's a bit small
[02:20] <daftykins> plenty for Windows on its' own though
[02:20] <MDKwlan> Doesn't windows 7 have a program for idk real time editing of partitions?
[02:20] <BillyZane> yeah, i'm considering reformatting and starting over, i should have given it like 350gb
[02:20] <MDKwlan> It's been a while since I've used windows.
[02:20] <daftykins> BillyZane: just go for it then. boot the CD/DVD/USB and install to some free space. you'll want to partition manually though so Ubuntu doesn't take all the free space
[02:20] <daftykins> MDKwlan: obviously.
[02:21] <BillyZane> daftykins, that's the problem, i'm not sure how I would partition manually
[02:21] <daftykins> BillyZane: no, even 100GB is plenty for a C: for just Windows. then i'd have user data on a separate partition
[02:21] <BillyZane> daftykins, i've only really made partitions using install software
[02:21] <BillyZane> daftykins, yeah but i got itunes and several devices, plus i'd like to install softare on C
[02:21] <daftykins> BillyZane: you'd want to create a 100MB ext4 /boot, then say a 20GB ext4 /, then a 4GB swap, then some space for /home
[02:22] <MDKwlan> 4gb swap? Overkill?
[02:22] <daftykins> MDKwlan: no.
[02:22] <BillyZane> i've heard ext4 is not compatible with NTFS, ext3 is better no?
[02:22] <daftykins> BillyZane: both are incompatible with Windows.
[02:22] <BillyZane> daftykins, hard drives can only have 4 partitions, if i do that i would be left with 500 gigabytes of unused space
[02:22] <BillyZane> daftykins, so i wouldn't be able to access mp3s from an NTFS partition?
[02:23] <daftykins> BillyZane: i don't think you're right there.
=== thoughtcrime is now known as Athlon
[02:23] <BillyZane> i would prefer not to use the 3 partition method, i'm tired of buying hard drives

[02:31] <bazhang> BillyZane, so stop. and take it elsewhere.
[02:31] <b3nj> julian-delphiki: normally, /bin/bash is already set as default shell

[02:33] <BillyZane> daftykins, is there a way i can just install ubuntu on 1 partition
[02:33] <daftykins> BillyZane: i kinda lost interest.
[02:33] <BillyZane> no worries
[02:33] <daftykins> BillyZane: yeah, it'd suck, but you could make one big /
[02:33] <BillyZane> why would it suck?
[02:33] <daftykins> hard to say
[02:33] <BillyZane> is it for reinstalling?
[02:34] <BillyZane> you said you should have 1 100mb partition
[02:34] <BillyZane> i presume because of the constant updates, it would be better
[02:34] <daftykins> that was /boot where the kernels live
[02:34] <julian-delphiki> becuase you generally want several partitions for linux
[02:34] <daftykins> no nothing to do with updates
[02:34] <BillyZane> but why
[02:34] <julian-delphiki>  |/boot /home /tmp and / is a decent layout
[02:34] <MDKwlan> 4 partitions boot root home swap
[02:34] <BillyZane> i know swap is like the page file

[02:36] <Sling> and having /var on a separate partition is common too, especially to avoid filling your / to 100% with logs in /var/log
[02:37] <BillyZane> so, you say that it's not a 4  partition limit, but a 4 primary partition limit. if that's the case, i could have 4 linux partitions and 2 windows partitions on this hard drive. then, how many of the linux partitions would need to be primary? how do i even set these partitions to be primary or secondary?
[02:37] <HackinBlack> I'm Amish
[02:37] <Sling> but then again better to logrotate and monitor disk usage

[03:10] <wz> hi ki4ro
[03:10] <MaxElite> Can someone help me
[03:10] <KI4RO> bazhang, Yes
[03:10] <K1rk> MaxElite, don't ask to ask, just ask.
[03:11] <MaxElite> I am getting my laptop back for repair, but need to know if i should install the latest 12.10 or 12.04 witch i had before
[03:11] <K1rk> MaxElite, what factors are you looking for in making your decision?
[03:12] <K1rk> I personally like to stick to the LTS's. So I'm running 12.04 on all of my stuff.
[03:12] <MaxElite> I just want to know if there is any big change between 12.04 / 12.10. 12.04 works fine for me as far as drivers / support
[03:13] <^Mike> How can I switch there the close/min/max buttons appear in the titlebar of windows in unity? Currently they're on the right for un-maximized windows. I tried using gconf-editor to set /apps/metacity/general/button_layout to "close,minimize,maximize:menu" but it seems to have no effect
[03:13] <K1rk> Like I said MaxElite I'm personally an LTS guy. If the LTS works I'd stick with it. But it is up to you.  If everything worked for you in 12.04, what are you looking to gain?
[03:13] <K1rk> Also 12.10 has that controversial Unity shopping lens... granted, it can be uninstalled.
[03:14] <MaxElite> Well that i dont know k1rk, Ill just stick with 12.04. Wasn't sure if i really needed 12.10 or not.
[03:15] <Maxeliiite> So what is the differences with 12.04 and 12.10 ?

[03:34] <threex5> Hi, I have a crossover cable between two ubuntu (well, mint) machines and they aren't talking to each other
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[03:35] <daftykins> threex5: statically address them, IP wise
[03:35] <threex5> they just keep trying to connect and then disconnect, then try again. Does crossover cable networking generally work out-of-the-box in ubuntu?
[03:35] <solarcloud_3scrn> Hi there ,Could anyone tell me the command to turn off all WIFI devices within my netbook, please ?
[03:35] <threex5> ok daftykins, I can give that a shot
[03:35] <threex5> let me open my terminal
[03:35] <jon654> Is that an ethernet chord?
[03:35] <threex5> yes
[03:35] <daftykins> threex5: it's not a case of 'ubuntu', it's a case of whether the NICs or the drivers support Auto MDI/X
[03:36] <jon654> Ok, what exactly are you trying to do with the ethernet cord?
[03:36] <jon654> exchange files?
[03:36] <jon654> run the other's desktop?
[03:36] <threex5> jon654, transfer files.
[03:37] <jon654> threex5, ok, wouldn't it be easier to use bluetooth?
[03:37] <jazzkutya> and slower :)
[03:37] <c2tarun> Hi friends, I am using Xubuntu right now, I want to migrate to Ubuntu. I have separate home partition so that'll save my files. But about my installed apps, is there any way to retain all my installed apps in Ubuntu?
[03:37] <threex5> jon654, I don
[03:37] <threex5> don't think I have the hardware on either machine
[03:37] <jon654> oh ok
[03:38] <threex5> one is a desktop and i'm certain it has no bluetooth capability
[03:38] <bazhang> c2tarun, sure. install ubuntu-destkop package
[03:38] <threex5> daftykins, when you say to statically address them, do I do that from my router's firmware?
[03:38] <jon654> threex5, i know you can share an internet connection through the ethernet port, but i dont know about transfering files
[03:38] <threex5> (sorry if that's a dumb question)
[03:38] <jon654> threex5, i know you can share an internet connection through the ethernet port, but i dont know about transfering files
[03:38] <daftykins> threex5: you wouldn't be using a router if you were using a crossover cable...?
[03:38] <c2tarun> bazhang, long back when I was using Ubuntu, I tried installing KDE on Ubuntu and it didn't work that well as Kubuntu does :(. Will GNOME will work better?
[03:39] <solarcloud_3scrn> jon654 As Far As running Linux on an WM8650 .. I've found this link for you ... ::: http://liliputing.com/2012/06/arch-linux-on-a-66-wm8650-netbook.html
[03:39] <jon654> threex5, i know you can share an internet connection through the ethernet port, but i dont know about transfering files
[03:39] <jazzkutya> threex5: you can set up the network interface from the desktop, use the network icon somewhere at the top
[03:39] <jon654> thanks so much solarcloud_3scrn!!!!!
[03:39] <bazhang> c2tarun, no way of knowing without trying
[03:39] <solarcloud_3scrn> k
[03:39] <solarcloud_3scrn> Hi there ,Could anyone tell me the command to turn off all WIFI devices within my netbook, please ?
[03:39] <c2tarun> bazhang, :P Ok I'll try.
[03:39] <threex5> ok jazzkutya, I will go to system>administration>network and look there
[03:39] <jon654> sorry solarcloud_3scrn, idk
[03:40] <bazhang> solarcloud_3scrn, sudo ifdown device
[03:40] <solarcloud_3scrn> thanx.
[03:40] <bazhang> solarcloud_3scrn, wlan0 for example
[03:41] <jazzkutya> threex5: basically you have to manually set up ip network parameters instead of dhcp. set 192.168.1.1 on one machine and 192.168.1.2 on the other, netmask 255.255.255.0 on both, no router and no gateway
[03:41] <c2tarun> bazhang, should I install whole Ubuntu-desktop package or just Unity? Installing whole ubuntu-desktop package will install all the default apps of Ubuntu as well right?
=== jon654_ is now known as jon654
[03:41] <jon654> Yes c2tarun
[03:42] <bazhang> c2tarun, "just Unity" is not some minimal install
[03:42] <solarcloud_3scrn> bazhang, It says the inferface is not configured ?
[03:42] <jazzkutya> threex5: i guess you have 2 network interfaces on your current machine, one for the internet and the other for the connection to other machine - be sure to not break your internet connection
[03:42] <jon654> c2tarun, it should install all default apps including a microsoft-like office program
[03:42] <bazhang> solarcloud_3scrn, so check in ifconfig what is
[03:42] <solarcloud_3scrn> k
[03:42] <jazzkutya> threex5: that is you have to know what network interface to configure
[03:42] <bazhang> jon654, called libreoffice
[03:42] <threex5> jazzkutya, you're one step ahead of me
[03:43] <threex5> i'm trying to determine now which is which
[03:43] <KI4RO> Tex_Nick, Thanks...been to that one many times LOL
[03:43] <threex5> i'm going to assume eth0 is internet and eth1 is the crossover
[03:43] <jon654> yes bazhang, they used to use open office, but now libreoffice
[03:43] <threex5> although if you know how to quickly tell which is which from the command line that would be helpful
[03:43] <jazzkutya> threex5: ifconfig
[03:44] <KI4RO> Tex_Nick, My son is using the Windows PC and I seem to be something wrong there which doesn't allow it to connect to the printer
[03:44] <KI4RO> *to be doing...
[03:44] <jazzkutya> threex5: with ifconfig you will see that the interface used for internet has an ip address while the other one does not
[03:45] <threex5> i see
[03:45] <threex5> ok it was the other way around. I'm glad I checked
[03:45] <metap0d> When I install the additional drivers for my Nvidia card ... how can I "uninstall" them? I tried the experimental, current and current-updates and want to remove the 2 I'm no longer using
[03:45] <nandhu> hi i am having a .TTF file which is my local language font which i use in windows to type in word document and how can i install it in ubuntu
[03:45] <metap0d> or maybe a better question is ... where do they get stored?
[03:46] <dr_willis> metap0d:  you can use that 'disable' option in the addational-drivers tool. or use the package manager tools to uninstall the package
[03:46] <threex5> ok so now I need to assign a static ip to each. but which to choose?
[03:46] <jazzkutya> threex5: what is the ip address of your internet-interface?
[03:47] <dr_willis> nandhu:  simple way sould be make a .fonts direcory in your HOME and copy the file into the .fonts dir
[03:47] <threex5> should I use the same one that my router uses, explicitly use different ones, or does it matter?
[03:47] <jazzkutya> threex5: don't use ... hey why didn't you connect the other machine to the same router? that would be lot easier
[03:47] <nandhu> means i have to create mkdir ~/.fonts
[03:47] <nandhu> and copy the TTF font there
[03:47] <threex5> well, jazzkutya, one machine is 192.168.1.103
[03:47] <c2tarun> bazhang, I did some research on internet (and everywhere I am getting how to install some other DE on Ubuntu), now I am going to install ubuntu-desktop package, will that do all?
[03:48] <nandhu> then it will automatically show in open office
[03:48] <sylphie> threex5 \ if it's not connected to your router then is should be on a different address range
[03:48] <dr_willis> nandhu:  it should i think
[03:48] <threex5> jazzkutya, theoretically true, but I'm in a big house with roommates and the router is across the house
[03:48] <Tex_Nick> KI4RO : if you could explain in detail what you have tried ( including Win & Ubuntu distros ) and what the results are ... it would give people here a better idea of how to help ... wish i had the magic answer for you ... someone will though :)
[03:48] <nandhu> thanks let me try
[03:48] <threex5> i would prefer to directly chain them
[03:48] <dr_willis> unless that office app is weird. ;)
[03:48] <jazzkutya> threex5: what do you mean with "one machine"?
[03:48] <c2tarun> bazhang, I actually want to go to Unity for a while.
[03:49] <kostkon> nandhu, did you try to double click on it
[03:49] <metap0d> dr_willis: Ok I'll try that, thanks. Brb.
[03:49] <jon654> does anyone know how to put Windows Ce Or UBUNTU on a Generic Android 2.2 Tablet (it doesnt have sync cable, but does have microsd, and is a tablet, not a netbook AKA Eken m009s or WM8650)?
[03:49] <jazzkutya> threex5: but anyway use 192.168.2.1 for one machine and 192.168.2.2 for the other.
[03:49] <jon654> does anyone know how to put Windows Ce Or UBUNTU on a Generic Android 2.2 Tablet (it doesnt have sync cable, but does have microsd, and is a tablet, not a netbook AKA Eken m009s or WM8650)?
[03:49] <threex5> ok
[03:49] <dr_willis> nandhu:  i thought if you double clicked on a ttf it had a previewer with an install button also
[03:49] <threex5> subnet mask? gateway address? does it matter?
[03:50] <dr_willis> jon654:  with so many varitry of tablets - theres no way to tell. Unless #ubuntu-arm knows of that device
[03:50] <jon654> does anyone know how to put Windows Ce Or UBUNTU on a Generic Android 2.2 Tablet (it doesnt have sync cable, but does have microsd, and is a tablet, not a netbook AKA Eken m009s or WM8650)?
[03:50] <jazzkutya> threex5: subnet: 255.255.255.0, no gateway, no nameserver
[03:50] <sylphie> threex5 \ if you're doing a direct connect with no router, remember to use crossover cable
[03:50] <kostkon> dr_willis, it is; it doesn't recognise otf fonts.
[03:50] <threex5> sylphie, I got one thanks
[03:50] <threex5> ok, the moment of truth...
[03:50] <jon654> dr_willis: what is ubuntu arm?
[03:50] <jazzkutya> sylphie: nowadays pretty much every ethernet interface autodetects cross or straight cables
[03:51] <dr_willis> jon654:  #ubuntu-arm is the irc channel for ubuntu on arm hardware
[03:51] <nandhu> so kostkon how do i convert it
[03:51] <jon654> what is ARM? Dr_willis
[03:51] <nandhu> because even if i copy in the ./fonts folder it is not working
[03:51] <sylphie> the cheap nics they build into m/b's often don't autodetect
[03:51] <jon654> Android?
[03:51] <nandhu> its not showing in open office
[03:51] <dr_willis> jon654  the cpu used by most tablets
[03:51] <jon654> ok thanks dr_willis
[03:51] <nandhu> no ubuntu
[03:51] <kostkon> nandhu, your font is ttf so you should be ok
[03:52] <threex5> weird. it seems to have confused both machines
[03:52] <threex5> what was reading as 'eth0' is now 'eth1'
[03:53] <nandhu> kostkon do i need to reboot the machine to make the font to show in open office
[03:53] <nandhu> after copying to ./fonts folder
[03:53] <threex5> so i have two 'eth1' connections listed. it switches from that to 'point to point connection'
[03:53] <threex5> and both are still trying to connect and then disconnecting, trying to reconnect...
[03:53] <jon654> how can I connect to ubuntu ARM?
[03:54] <kostkon> nandhu, i assume you want to say ~/fonts, but actually the folder name should be .fonts and not just plain fonts
[03:54] <threex5> why can't i just use dhcp?
[03:54] <dr_willis> jon654:  #ubuntu-arm is  a channel here on this server. Join it same as you would any other cchannel with your irc client.   /join #channelname
[03:55] <jon654> ok thanks dr_willis, this is the first time using this program
[03:55] <jazzkutya> threex5: because you have to connect the other machine to use the router's dhcp
[03:55] <jazzkutya> threex5: and setting up own dhcp is not easy
[03:55] <jazzkutya> threex5: i mean u have to conncet the other machine to the router too
[03:56] <threex5> jazzkutya, I think there may be some confusion. both computers are already connected through the router
[03:57] <threex5> one wirelessly, one with a wire
[03:57] <jazzkutya> threex5: then you should be able to see each other thru the router
[03:57] <threex5> however, the transfer speed isn't as good, and with samba, my file transfers are timing out
[03:57] <solarcloud_3scrn> I still have this probem with my Lubuntu/Samsung netbook . Can't turn off WIFI light which is in the middle of the 5 lights at the bottom of the picture ...

[03:59] <jazzkutya> threex5: you could try setting up an ftp server on one of the machines
[03:59] <dr_willis> wesam_:   It has its own (rather poor i found) support forums/channel
[03:59] <jazzkutya> threex5: or you can use scp from commandlive to transfer files

[04:02] <jon654> would debian work? dr_willis ?
[04:02] <dr_willis> wesam_:  id suggestt checking out that chromeos psakcage (saw it at either webupd8 or omgubuntu) that you can install  and have a chromeos 'session' on a ubuntu install
[04:02] <threex5> jazzkutya, do i need to install scp first?
[04:02] <dr_willis> wesam_:  use the jolicloud extension in chrome  perhaps.
[04:02] <threex5> or is it integrated with ubuntu? I already have openssh on both machines
[04:02] <jazzkutya> threex5: it is already installed i think but install openssh-server on one (bettet both) machines
[04:02] <dr_willis> jon654:  installing ANY alternative OS on a ARM Tablet will be very very hardware specific
[04:03] <dr_willis> jon654:  if its even possible for a given tablet

[04:04] <dr_willis> solarcloud_3scrn:  so is ther some actual problem other then the light not going off?
[04:04] <solarcloud_3scrn> no
[04:04] <solarcloud_3scrn> just might thought i could be hacked with it switched on ... security.
[04:04] <dr_willis> so everything is working fine.. theres just an annoying blue led..
[04:04] <wesam_> dr_willis: Is chrome OS free?
[04:04] <dr_willis> wesam_:  yes
[04:04] <jon654> wesam_ yes
[04:05] <Tex_Nick> jon654 : see if this helps ... https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
[04:05] <tozen> jon654: ubuntu -unity, kubuntu - kde, xubuntu - lxdm
[04:05] <threex5> ok jazzkutya, so for server, do i just put in the ip address of each other, based on what it is on the router?
[04:05] <jon654> thanks Tex_Nick and tozen
[04:05] <jon654> wesam_: http://getchrome.eu/download.php
[04:06] <Tex_Nick> jon654 : np :)
[04:06] <sylphie> solarcloud_3scrn \ you could wrap it in tinfoil to be sure
[04:06] <threex5> wowwww
[04:06] <dr_willis> wesam_:  there was some chrome-installer pakcage out for ubuntu now that lets you try it out (not exactly the same  as a chromeos install)   in a ubuntu session. sort of a good compramize. login to Unity, or whatver for work..  let the kids use chromeos
[04:06] <threex5> it actually worked! exciting
[04:06] <jazzkutya> threex5: i'm not sure about what you see on the router but if you check the ip address on both machines with ifconfig then you can use thone on the other one
[04:07] <threex5> this is great
[04:07] <threex5> samba was such a pain in the butt
[04:07] <threex5> and I didn't see the point in it when both my machines are linux
[04:08] <jazzkutya> threex5: i'm glad i could help :)
[04:08] <dr_willis> threex5:  i find sshfs handy on linux to linux network also
[04:08] <Justice> what command do i need to run to completly update ubuntu from the terminal? "apt-get update && apt-get upgrade"  or "apt-get upgrade -d" or "apt-get dist-upgrade"  does not do it..
[04:08] <threex5> thank you so much for your help. I will try to do a file transfer and see it works. I would still like to be able to use my crossover cable but I'll try this first
[04:08] <jazzkutya> threex5: i still hope scp will be better in the long run than samba, samba should have been good already
[04:08] <dr_willis> Justasic:  you mean update installed packages? or upgrade to the next release?
=== wesam is now known as Guest9981
[04:11] <con-man> whats the package for install sh files again?
[04:11] <Guest9981> Okay, downloading. Now, is there a way on Chrome OS to get normal apps to run? Like GIMP or some other excecutable? Is it all internet?
[04:11] <jon654> yes
[04:11] <dr_willis> con-man that makes no sence
[04:11] <jon654> you can download gime to your computer, there is a linux version... Guest9981
[04:11] <threex5> jazzkutya, i had been meaning to become proficient in ssh
[04:11] <jon654> *gimp
=== Guest9981 is now known as Wesam098
[04:11] <con-man> dr_willis, I have a file ending in .sh, and I wish to run it by typing ./filename.sh, what do I need for that?
[04:12] <threex5> my understanding is that it's the most secure protocol
[04:12] <Wesam098> jon654: And can I use apt-get and synaptic?
[04:12] <dr_willis> Wesam098:  for the chromeoos-in-ubuntu you can run chromeos in a window on your ubuntu desktop
[04:12] <threex5> also i want to install self-hosted sparkleshare and that requires ssh
[04:12] <Justice> con-man, terminal
[04:12] <jon654> I believe so wesam098
[04:12] <dr_willis> con-man:  make sure its executable  or do sh whaever.sh
[04:12] <Wesam098> jon654: Alright thanks
[04:13] <threex5> alright jazzkutya, file transfer froze right away
[04:13] <mikubuntu> clearly, i am inadvertently executing some keyboard command often when i am entering text into the chrome search bar, and it prompts a save screen to come up -- is this an ubuntu thing or a chrome thing?
[04:13] <threex5> wait
[04:13] <dr_willis> con-man:  what are you trying to run exactly?
[04:13] <threex5> no it didn't my bad
[04:13] <jon654> I have used ggl chrome os before, and I am 80% sure it came with a terminal wesam098
=== root is now known as Guest20945
[04:13] <jon654> milkubuntu this is for ubuntu
[04:14] <julian-delphiki> mikubuntu: sounds like a chrome thing. Ctrl-s?
[04:14] <jazzkutya> threex5: i know it's uncomfortable but give it 1-2 minutes to see if it can continue somehow
[04:14] <threex5> it had simply prompted me to overwrite a file, jazzkutya. my mistake
[04:14] <jazzkutya> ok :)
[04:15] <threex5> so now that i have an ssh connection, i can do cool stuff like remote control programs, right?
[04:15] <dr_willis> threex5:  ssh is the swiss-army-knife of tools.. ;)
[04:15] <threex5> i would like to remote into my other machine and change the music that's playing, for instance
[04:15] <jazzkutya> threex5: that depends on what do you mean by remote control
[04:15] <mikubuntu> julian-delphiki: don't think i'm hitting ctrl s but the truth is i don't know what it is that i hit when this happens ... drives me nuts tho every time
[04:15] <dr_willis> threex5:  many media players have web based plugins for remote controll also
[04:16] <threex5> dr_willis, i know xbmc does
[04:16] <threex5> i'm using nightingale right now though and I don't think it does
[04:16] <dr_willis> xbmc has several ways  to do it
[04:16] <julian-delphiki> but, yes, using screen and ssh you could easily have something that controlled music on anohter computer
[04:16] <mikubuntu> julian-delphiki: its possible i'm hitting shift on the left hand
[04:17] <jazzkutya> threex5: you can also login to your other machine with vnc/remote desktop, but i can't help you with this. others may help
[04:17] <con-man> dr_willis, sh filename.sh worked. thanks
[04:17] <con-man> dr_willis, was used to ./filename.sh
[04:17] <dr_willis> con-man:  if you make it EXECUTABLE you can do ./whatever.sh
[04:17] <julian-delphiki> con-man: to get that functionality you have to make the script executable
[04:18] <julian-delphiki> and if #!/bin/bash is the first line
[04:18] <julian-delphiki> or #!/bin/sh, whatever
[04:18] <con-man> thanks all
[04:19] <MDKwlan> Just food for thought but dose sh filename.sh and ./filename do the same thing?
[04:19] <dr_willis> if its a 'sh' script and not a 'bash' script
[04:19] <julian-delphiki> not necessarily
[04:19] <dr_willis> it does 'sh run this script file'
[04:20] <dr_willis>  ./filename would do whateve rthe first #! line tells it to do
[04:20] <dr_willis> using sh on a bash script - can cause unusual error messages. ;)
[04:21] <dr_willis> bbl.
[04:21] <MDKwlan> Ah kk
[04:21] <MDKwlan> Cheers.
[04:25] <d0lphin_> Hello :)
[04:26] <b1lly> somehow my video drivers got fucked up
[04:26] <b1lly> and my display is stuck @ smallest res
[04:26] <b1lly> and I tried uninstalling/reinstalling my nvidia drivers but nothing works
[04:27] <d0lphin_> I`m sorry about the question but i install her the ubuntu 12.10 and when i reboot it dont give me the image of the grub... so i cant chose what operating system i want... and i cant even go to the windows now... any idea about what happend and how can i resolve this... i allready try to select whith gparted the windows partition but it keeps me go to ubuntu whith no image to chose anything
[04:28] <Omen_20> Could someone please tell me if there is an equivalent to Ctr+Alt+Delete in Ubuntu because it still locks up for me at times and once it does I'm left holding the power button.
=== Athlon is now known as StormTrooper
[04:29] <xangua> Omen_20: you can enable it on Keyboard preferences
[04:29] <jazzkutya> Omen_20: that should be ctrl-alt-del if i'm not mistaken. you can try swithing to a text console first with ctrl-alt-f1 but if these don't work then the keyboard is not working because of the lockup
[04:29] <threex5> Omen_20, there's also a series of key commands that allow you to safely shut down a frozen linux machine
[04:30] <xangua> more precise in Keyboard distribution Omen_20
[04:30] <threex5> I can't remember off hand but it's a series of alt+sysreq commands
[04:31] <threex5> Omen_20: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_SysRq_key
[04:32] <Omen_20> Ok thanks guys. So doing a logout even when everything seems frozen may send me back to an active login screen?
[04:33] <d0lphin_> Is there anyone that having problems about give image of the grub to chose the operating system after one clean install?
[04:34] <jon654> lilstevie: how did you port it?
[04:34] <Omen_20> I remember back a couple of years ago apps would lock for me every now and then but I had that kill applet where I could just click the app and it would close. I was just full screen using a web app and couldn't do anything.
[04:35] <Tex_Nick> Omen_20 : a useful guide for ubuntu keyboard shortcuts can be found here ... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KeyboardShortcuts
[04:35] <jazzkutya> if it's only one app you still can switch workspaces
[04:35] <jon654> Has anyone else ever ported Ubuntu onto an android tablet? by taking off android and putting on ubuntu?
[04:36] <threex5> Omen_20, there's also a key combination that will force you back to the login screen
[04:36] <threex5> i can't remember what it is though
[04:36] <Omen_20> Looks like my issue came from a background app in Chrome, not even one I was using. 365Scores is doing a popup saying it is crashing and the icon is grayed out on my new tab screen. Had no clue Chrome even had that functionality. Must me a ChromeOS thing.
[04:36] <threex5> and then there's alt+ctrl f1 which will put you into command line. from there you can run top to show (and kill) running processe
[04:36] <threex5> s
[04:37] <jazzkutya> threex5: it would be ctrl-alt-backspace but it is disabled by default
[04:37] <savagecroc> what command can i run to check if a group exists
[04:37] <savagecroc> id apps .. does not seem to work for groups
[04:38] <threex5> would someone mind telling me how I could remote control a gui using ssh?
[04:38] <julian-delphiki> savagecroc, groups are in /etc/groups
[04:38] <savagecroc> yeah.. i know.. but i'm looking for a commadn
[04:38] <julian-delphiki> threex5, it depends on the program
[04:38] <aeon-ltd> threex5: you mean ssh -x ?
[04:38] <savagecroc> command similiar to id
[04:38] <jon654> Has anyone else ever ported Ubuntu onto an android tablet? by taking off android and putting on ubuntu?
[04:38] <threex5> example: I have a computer across the room hooked up to speakers and I want to open the media player and change the song
[04:38] <Omen_20> yeah theex5 I need to relearn all of this stuff. At one time I knew quite a bit of it but I've forgotten so much of it as I havent had issues in so long.
[04:38] <julian-delphiki> jon654: i dont think that's possible currently
[04:39] <jon654> some other person said hes done it 3 times julian-selphiki
[04:39] <aeon-ltd> threex5: in that particular case i think it'd make sense to use mpd, or anything else capable of streaming
[04:39] <threex5> aeon-ltd, I don't know if that's what I mean. I think when I asked this in a different channel that was mentioned
[04:39] <jon654> some other person said hes done it 3 times julian-delphiki
[04:39] <threex5> aeon-ltd, what's mpd?
[04:39] <julian-delphiki> jon654: what device do you have
[04:39] <ChronicleX> threex5:  use teamviewer instead of ssh
[04:39] <Tex_Nick> jon654 : that would be device specific :)
[04:39] <aeon-ltd> threex5: music player daemon
[04:40] <jon654> eken m009s or wm8650 (two names, same product)
[04:40] <threex5> huh
[04:40] <julian-delphiki> oh wow, that's an old tab
[04:40] <Omen_20> jon654 Ubuntu has been ported to the Nexus 7. I'm waiting to see if UbuntuPhone will be able to.
[04:40] <threex5> mpd looks pretty cool.
[04:40] <d0lphin_> Any ideia how to repair the grub? it isnt give me image so i cant chose the operating system...
[04:40] <aeon-ltd> !fixgrub
[04:40] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[04:41] <threex5> you know, may be getting carried away, but I had this idea where I wanted to throw a party
[04:41] <threex5> and at the party, every room in my house would be playing the same song
[04:41] <d0lphin_> aeon-ltd thanks :)
[04:41] <threex5> like you would go through the house and different computers would be hooked up to different speaker systems
[04:41] <threex5> but they would be playing off one playlist and it would all be perfectly synchronized
[04:42] <threex5> i think that would be so awesome
[04:43] <solarcloud_3scrn> jon654, U still there ??
[04:43] <d0lphin_> aeon-ltd the problem is that the grb it dont give me image lol Mother of God

[04:47] <threex5> ok aeon-ltd, i'm excited about mpd. to start, I probably need to install mpd on both computers, server and client. then i need to install a gui on the client
[04:47] <threex5> does that sound right?
[04:47] <aeon-ltd> yeah
[04:47] <aeon-ltd> pretty much
[04:47] <th3pun15h3r> or you can just use gnu-screen?
[04:47] <west> How do I reset my default web-browser so that I can open one from right clicking and choosing "Open Link in browser".
[04:47] <julian-delphiki> yeah, you really dont need a gui
[04:48] <solarcloud_3scrn> oh OK .. I was going to try it with the same nettbook that was on the liliputing.com website that I gave you jon654,

[04:52] <jon655> Look up eken m009s solarcloud_3scrn
[04:53] <solarcloud_3scrn> if you can find a netbook for $30 and add a option of a 64GB SSD for extra bucks .. you've got a business !!
[04:53] <solarcloud_3scrn> will do

[04:53] <jon655> solarcloud_3scrn
[04:53] <julian-delphiki> jon655, its probably not possible

[04:54] <th3pun15h3r> have to make sure your chipset on your tablet is supported

[04:56] <lilstevie> rodayo: galaxy nexus
[04:56] <th3pun15h3r> guess the nook color is suppose to be pretty good for it...says people have been able to run ubuntu debian and lubuntu
[04:56] <lilstevie> the nook would be fine
[04:56] <lilstevie> it at least has a fairly modern cpu
[04:56] <solarcloud_3scrn> i've got a ook
[04:56] <solarcloud_3scrn> **nook
[04:57] <jon655> solarcloud_3scrn, i got it cuz it was the cheapest tablet at the time, and i thought you could put ubuntu on it, Also, when i bought it, I wouldnt know how slow it was
[04:57] <th3pun15h3r> unity for me is built for tablets
[04:57] <jazzkutya> blargh. don't trust any computer you can lift up :)
[04:57] <rodayo> lilstevie, great, thanks! Do you know by any chance when the phone os is being released?
[04:57] <jon655> Also the tablet is plastic and not glass, so the touchscreen is bad
[04:58] <jon655> th3pun15h3r what do you mean?
[04:58] <lilstevie> rodayo: no idea, I have read somewhere that images for the galaxy nexus should be released sometime around the end of feb
[04:58] <solarcloud_3scrn> oh ok .. I use h-node.org quite a lot to see how far we can stretch hardware .. I was just wondeing if the WM*^%) ARM would be a good addition to the site .. maybe ??
[04:58] <solarcloud_3scrn> **WM8650 ARM
[04:58] <jon655> h-node.org?
[04:59] <solarcloud_3scrn> www. too
[04:59] <rodayo> lilstevie, alright, thank you.
[04:59] <jon655> i know that
[04:59] <lilstevie> solarcloud_3scrn: problem is most arm devices do not support upgradeable storage but rather use soldered down NAND or eMMC chips
[05:00] <th3pun15h3r> anyone else having the same issue where your wifi adapter is turned off when your screen dims
[05:00] <jon655> oh, do you think it will work with my tablet th3pun15h3r?
[05:00] <solarcloud_3scrn> lilstevie, OH Ok, I get it now .. would it be hackable though .. by an engineer ?
[05:00] <julian-delphiki> jon655, UBUNTU WILL NOT WORK ON YOUR TABLET
[05:00] <jon655> ok
[05:01] <lilstevie> solarcloud_3scrn: in a lot of cases the best you could do is replace the chip, they do not have SATA interfaces
[05:01] <lilstevie> solarcloud_3scrn: only the very latest chips are starting to bring sata
[05:01] <lilstevie> but OEMs are still sticking with eMMC
[05:01] <solarcloud_3scrn> it's not sata...
[05:01] <Richiie_> Hi! does anyone here have a raspberry pi ? i know this is not the official support  channel regarding raspberry but im curios about one thing someone may know the answer
[05:01] <lilstevie> isn't it?
[05:01] <lilstevie> hold on let me look again :p
[05:01] <solarcloud_3scrn> its PATA
[05:02] <lilstevie> solarcloud_3scrn: oh, same deal then
[05:02] <Tex_Nick> hey guys ... tablets, hardware & non-ubuntu OS'are really off-topic
[05:02] <jon655> solarcloud_3scrn: what do you think?
[05:02] <Tex_Nick> !ot
[05:02] <ubottu> #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[05:02] <solarcloud_3scrn> jon655, about getting lubuntuon ya tablet, or what ??
[05:02] <jon655> ya
[05:03] <lilstevie> jon655: your best bet would be to try archlinux or debian
[05:03] <jon655> ok thanks!
[05:03] <lilstevie> they still support your arch
[05:03] <jon655> where could i find arch
[05:03] <jon655> Tex_Nick I was asking how to put ubuntu on my android tablet, That IS ON Topic
[05:04] <solarcloud_3scrn> it's possible but if you read the link i gave earlier (bookmark it).. you'd have to hack the kernel , I do have a spare Linus in the toolbox to do that, do you ??
[05:04] <solarcloud_3scrn> **I don't have
[05:04] <jon655> Idk what that is
[05:04] <lilstevie> solarcloud_3scrn: not really, you would have to recompile the software repository to put ubuntu on his tablet
[05:04] <Tex_Nick> jon655 ... well it kinda went wild :)
=== fenris is now known as Guest4248
[05:04] <solarcloud_3scrn> jon655, but seriously, you've got no chance..
[05:05] <jon655> ok
[05:05] <solarcloud_3scrn> lilstevie, he was talking about arch -linux
[05:05] <d0lphin_> Well... thanks for the help anyway :)
[05:06]  * solarcloud_3scrn pets the dolphin, politely. :)
[05:06] <d0lphin_> solarcloud_3scrn lol [] :)
[05:06] <d0lphin_> Cya stay well
[05:06] <th3pun15h3r> does ubuntu really support any wireless n adapters? or just g based signals?
[05:06] <jon655> solarcloud_3scrn how'd you do that
[05:07] <solarcloud_3scrn>   do */me*
[05:07] <solarcloud_3scrn> without the *'s
[05:07] <jon655> "[ERROR]	Missing required parameter action."
[05:07] <jon655> thats what i got
[05:08] <jon655> do /me
[05:08] <th3pun15h3r> dang im still trying to remember all the irc command stuff from +10 years ago
[05:08] <jon655> huh?
[05:08] <solarcloud_3scrn> forwardslash+me
[05:08] <jazzkutya> jon655: do /me stinks :)
[05:08]  * jon655 stinks
[05:08] <jon655> oh
[05:08] <Stephini> /me blah
[05:09] <jon655> i got it
[05:09] <solarcloud_3scrn> thanks - I accept most major credit cards :D
[05:09]  * jon655 finds out his tablet is useless and cannot run ubuntu
[05:09] <Stephini> anyway the reason i rejoined. i'm actually getting set to install and i wanted to ask. do i still hafta install windows before linux? or did windows stop stealing the MBR?
[05:09] <blues_> for a headless server running latest ubuntu-server, what is the best torrent client? I was using transmission on my centos box, not sure if there's a better option these days though
[05:10] <jon655> Stephini: no
[05:10] <Stephini> no to which?
[05:10] <jazzkutya> Stephini: you don't have to, but it is a lot easier to install windows first
[05:10] <jon655> as long as you extract the iso file to a dvd and boot/install through that, you don't need windows
[05:10] <jazzkutya> Stephini: it still steals mbr
[05:11] <jon655> as long as you extract the iso file to a dvd and boot/install through that, you don't need windows
[05:11] <jon655> Stephini
[05:11] <Stephini> blegh...guess i gotta find that stupid thumbdrive i have win on then...if the computer i was working with had a working disc drive life would be so much easier... >.< could just pop in my dvd..
[05:12] <jon655> the dvd will work!
[05:12] <jon655> just boot from the dvd
[05:12] <jon655> stephini, just boot from the dvd
[05:12] <Stephini> jon read what i said would make life easier
[05:12] <paul__> I'm using Ubuntu desktop (I think 11.5)  and it keeps freezing completely!  Only my mouse moves.  I think it maybe only while playing a flash game on facebook, but not sure.
[05:12] <jon655> oh
[05:13] <Stephini> my craptop is a dieing POS...nothing compared to the glory of my gaming box...dvd drive was just the first thing to die.
[05:13] <jazzkutya> who needs dvd anyway
[05:13] <Tex_Nick> th3pun15h3r : ubuntu will support 802.11n, however it is adapter specific ... also some wf-fi ap's advertise n capability when they are only n capable through the hard ports ... provide more sepcifics
[05:13] <jon655> well usb will work, or an external dvd drive
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[05:14] <Stephini> yeah usb will work once i find my drive...i haven't installed win in about a year...so i'm not sure where i put it...heh
[05:14] <th3pun15h3r> you really dont
[05:14]  * th3pun15h3r wants lan
[05:14] <jon655> You just need the ubuntu iso extracted to a usb!
[05:14] <jon655> Stephini
[05:15] <threex5> OK so I installed mpd on both machines. on the server i ran sudo mpd and got 'Failed to bind to '[::]:6600': Address already in use
[05:15] <Stephini> -th3pun15h3r- it doesn't seem to talk over the MPATA/MSATA whichever it is properly...the os can ID it, and it will spin up..but it wont send the disc info over and the open command doesn't get through.
[05:15] <Stephini> jon i have my ubuntu drive good to go...just not my win drive...since i hafta install win first to have both without alot of hassle it's best to wait to find the win drive.
[05:16] <jazzkutya> jon655: his question implies he wants a dual boot system. let's not question what he thinks about needing windows
[05:16] <jon655> u just need the usb, not the win stephini
[05:16] <threex5> aeon-ltd, are you still around?
[05:16] <Stephini> as jazz pointed otu i'm trying to get dual boot...as a gamer and game dev i need both OSes... :P
[05:17] <jazzkutya> Stephini: don't forget to install steam on linux :)
[05:17] <Stephini> lolz i already did on my live run through just to try it out...was disapointed to find out only 2 of my games have linux without having to go to the humble bundle site... :(
[05:17] <jazzkutya> :)
[05:18] <jon655> jazzkutya what is steam
[05:18] <Stephini> jon steam is a DRM service for video games
[05:18] <jazzkutya> jon655: it's an online game distribution platform (shop) for games
[05:18] <jon655> oh
[05:18] <Stephini> ehh it's really more DRM than store...they take way less cut than a real store would.
[05:18] <jazzkutya> with drm included of course
[05:18] <jazzkutya> still better than some other  drms
[05:19] <Stephini> indeed
[05:19] <jazzkutya> but this is offtopic
[05:19] <th3pun15h3r> ugh
[05:19] <Stephini> dont see it being much different than EA DRM tho...origin is pretty nice...just lacking linux support...heh
[05:19] <marz_> How  do i extract .rar files?
[05:19] <Stephini> 7zip works nicely
[05:19] <Stephini> marz_ your who i was talking to with that last one
[05:20] <Stephini> you're* perhaps. sorry i suck at grammar.
[05:20] <jon655> free frog rar extractor
[05:20] <Stephini> free frog? never heard of that. is it better than 7zip somehow/
[05:20] <marz_> Stephini, I already installed something using "sudo apt-get install unrar
[05:20] <jazzkutya> marz_: unrar x something.rar
[05:20] <Tex_Nick> th3pun15h3r : there is a lot of chatter on the web about that ... have a look at this, see if it helps ... if not there are other resourses :)
[05:21]  * th3pun15h3r sticking with ubuntu 12.04 lts has been able to run every game i want to play other than battlefield since it requires at least directx10 which playonlinux/wine cant handl
[05:21] <th3pun15h3r> e
[05:21] <marz_> what is x for? does it refer to where i want it to be extracted?
[05:21] <Tex_Nick> th3pun15h3r : sorry ... here is the link ... http://askubuntu.com/questions/168627/connecting-asus-usb-n13-wireless-adapter
[05:21] <Stephini> th3pun15h3r, does cedega or crossover maybe run that one better?
[05:21] <jazzkutya> marz_: it tells unrar that the operation to perform is eXtract. it extracts to currend directory
[05:22] <marz_> jazzkutya: does x refers to the location where i want it to be extracted?
[05:22] <Stephini> lolz marz is playing jeopordy
[05:23] <th3pun15h3r> I know a paid service went free all of a sudden
[05:23] <marz_> Stephini, I'm sorry I'm new to linux I'm quite confused
[05:24] <marz_> jazzkutya: Can I extract it to a certain directory?
[05:24] <Stephini> marz i was teasing you about asking like RIGHT ater the answer was given. ignore me i tease everything/everyone
[05:24] <agoebel> I just tried to install ubuntu on a friends machine, and it refuses to boot
[05:25] <marz_> Stephini, hehehe it's okay. :D
[05:25] <agoebel> date
[05:25] <Stephini> -th3pun15h3r- because of holes in support i am planning to run cedega, pol, and crossover in parralel... :P
[05:26] <jazzkutya> marz_: probably you can handle the rar file with the desktop file manager after installing unrar, look around in right click context menu
[05:26] <Tex_Nick> agoebel : please be more specific ... what ubuntu distro and what hardware
[05:26] <Stephini> just call me paranoidly over cautious tho i guess.
[05:26] <marz_> jazzkutya: okay thanks. I just wanted to play around with the CLI hehehe
[05:26] <BillyZane> how do i access "my computer" on ubuntu? serious question
[05:26] <BillyZane> i mean, how do i access the file system
[05:26] <jazzkutya> marz_: well then first cd to directory where you want to extract and then unrar x /path/to/something.rar
[05:27] <Stephini> -th3pun15h3r- can pol be used to launch win-steam and then use that in pol to launch your DRMed games?
[05:27] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane ... what ubuntu distro ?
[05:28] <jazzkutya> marz_: also see man unrar
[05:28] <jazzkutya> marz_: reading man pages is good for playing around and learning CLI
[05:30] <Stephini> -th3pun15h3r- sure would be handy. but would the wine guys go for that? since steam is a closed binary and wine is built on OS wouldn't there be some conflict?
[05:31] <jon655> What is good about ubuntu server?
[05:31] <jazzkutya> the textmode installer is worth everything unless it's buggy :)
[05:31] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick: i'm running 12.10
[05:32] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick, i just want to be able to navigate the file system using a GUI
[05:32] <Stephini> -th3pun15h3r- that's what i meant by OS...
[05:32] <Stephini> isn't most OS software licensed in a way that forbids it being bundled with closed binary apps?
[05:32] <jon655> I don't think so
[05:33] <jon655> Ok... If I have Ubuntu Server on one computer, can I network boot from another and run ubuntu as the os?
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[05:34] <jazzkutya> jon655: can do that, but it's very complex
[05:34] <dgreeley> jon655: as in pxe booting from a server?
[05:35] <jon655> i think... like schools and businesses do with windows
[05:35] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : if you're using unity ... click the home icon in the launcher
[05:35] <dgreeley> yes, it can be done, but as jasskutya said, it's complex
[05:35] <jon655> where each person has user and they can use it on any computer as long as it network boots to the computer.... jazzkutya ... dgreeley
[05:36] <jon655> *as it network boots to the server
[05:36] <Stephini> isn't that "workstation access" structure?
[05:36] <jon655> I dont know what that is, but i think
[05:37] <jon655> (its like schools and businesses, they give each employee a username and password, and they can use it on any computer and it will load their desktop) *Many businesses use windows
[05:37] <Stephini> all the schools i went to didn't so much network boot as have a simplified OS on each client with workstation rights that would map a directory on the server as a local folder.
[05:39] <Stephini> and that could be acheived by having the server have workgroup access limits on a folder for each unit then have a bash script on the client that runs on login connecting to the workgroup folder and mapping/mounting it. no?
[05:39] <jon655> oh, well by what i've seen, an employee turns on the computer and they type in a specific username and password, and it logsthem into their desktop, and they could use this desktop on any computer connected to the server
[05:40] <dr_willis> unix/linux has been able to do that for years :)
[05:40] <dgreeley> sounds like a roaming profile
[05:40] <dr_willis> or homes mounted over nfs with some other things setup
[05:40] <dgreeley> aye
[05:41] <jon655> Wow. I need to try that!
[05:41] <Stephini> jon the school i worked at you could customize your desktop and folders till the cows came home and it was persistant across machines even tho they each had an actual OS on them just because it mapped their user directory in place of the system's local user directory.
[05:41] <dr_willis> or you just use the xdmcp feature of X/ligdm/gdm/whatever and have an actual session running on a main server. using the localbox as a X server
[05:42] <threex5> is anyone still around who could help me with mpd?
[05:42] <jazzkutya> dr_willis: indeed. bat that is a different approach
[05:42] <jazzkutya> *but
[05:42] <jon655> one more thing. Can you use Ubuntu server as a login in order to connect to the internet? Like in schools and business where when you connect to the router, it brings them to an html webpage to sign in
[05:43] <jazzkutya> btw does lightdm (or gdm) support xdmcp in current ubuntu?
[05:43] <Stephini> i think that is done by having the server do the routing
[05:43] <dr_willis> jazzkutya:  yes. but its disable by default
[05:43] <jazzkutya> will check and play with it later
[05:43] <dr_willis> im pretty sure lightdm now has xdmcp
[05:43] <jon655> ok
[05:44] <jon655> Thanks!
[05:45] <Stephini> hey guys how much would it cost to build a home router running on ubuntu? would it be cheaper to just stick with sysco routing? i'm hoping to have gigabit wired and a/b/g/n wireless...i figure i'll use a switch or hub for wired so the main unit would only need 2 eithernet ports...am i understanding that much right?
[05:46] <dr_willis> Stephini:  you can buy decent routers for $50 these days
[05:47] <jazzkutya> but do they crunch gigabit well? :)
[05:47] <Stephini> so: stick with sisco/linksys, then... figured. but also figured it doesn't hurt to ask.
[05:47] <dr_willis> who knows.. i spurged
[05:47] <devvrat_> stephini: see raspberrt pi
[05:47] <dr_willis> raspberry Pi dosent make a very good router
[05:47] <dr_willis> ;)
[05:48] <dr_willis> its a ok zncserver or other server on the lan however
[05:48] <Stephini> i'm so tired of my routers dieing every 3 years and having to remove 2 computers from the router to link them with gigabit...heh
[05:48] <jazzkutya> Stephini: many buy a router (usually linksys) that can accept linux firmware
[05:48] <dr_willis> I tend to replace routers every 3 yr or so anyway. for the newer featuresets
[05:48] <jazzkutya> Stephini: and customize them to their liking that way
[05:49] <Stephini> i did that...but something about ddwrt caused my computers to be unable to access half the pages on the net.
[05:49] <Stephini> so i had to revert to linksys firmware
[05:50] <Stephini> gerr..my win disc is nowhere on my desk... >.<

[05:52] <jon655> cant you use a network card and ubuntu server as a router?
[05:52] <jon655> bridge the ethernet and the Wifi together?
[05:52] <dr_willis>        you would most likely want more then 1 network card. :)
[05:52] <Stephini> 1 for up and 1 for down. then 1 going to your switch which also has a connection to your wireless adapter.
[05:52] <dr_willis> theres linux router disrtos that can turn a spare pc into a router
[05:53] <jazzkutya> 99.99% of linux kernels in use are already a router just the user does not know :)
[05:54] <jon655> is there a webpage telling you how to enable it?
[05:54] <jon655> jazzkutya
[05:54] <jazzkutya> well i guess there are a ton
[05:54] <devvrat_> does linexcnc is better to use??
[05:54] <dr_willis> the features of a router are allready there and going jon655
[05:54] <jon655> oh
[05:54] <jazzkutya> but there's a difference between that you think a router is and what i think a router is :)
[05:54] <dr_willis> just getting it set how you want is the laststep
[05:55] <dr_willis> !ics
[05:55] <ubottu> If you want to share the internet connection of your Ubuntu machine with other machines in the network see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Internet/ConnectionSharing
[05:55] <jon655> oh thats right!
[05:55] <jon655> i have bridged a windows laptop with the ethernet modem, and made it a router, but not with ubuntu
[05:56] <Stephini> jazzkutya, isn't a router defined as a service or device that controlls the path networked information moves along?
[05:57] <jon655> i thought a router is anything that can share a wifi connection through A/G/B/or N Networking
[05:57] <jazzkutya> Stephini: approximately i think, and this is more like my picture of a router. but to most ppl a router is a box sharing internet that may be configured with a website :)
[05:57] <jazzkutya> Stephini: see? :)
[05:57] <Stephini> jon that is a wireless accesspoint
[05:57] <dr_willis> routers dont need wifi at all jon655
[05:58] <jon655> oh
[05:58] <dr_willis> I have several old routers with no wifi
[05:58] <Stephini> if it's internet sharing you are looking at it's an accesspoint... a router is smarter... controlling the flow of information.
[05:58] <Stephini> i still dont quite get the difference between a hub and switch however... :P
[05:59] <jazzkutya> Stephini: basically a router is a network device that transfers IP packets between IP segments
[06:00] <Stephini> hub and switch are both intermediaries between the computer and the routing device both act basically as an access point for all computers down range to talk to the computer up range and then back down as necissary. so i just dont get how they aren't the same thing... heh
[06:01] <jazzkutya> Stephini: an 8 port hub when receives something on one port it relays to every other port, while an 8 port switch knows what mac address is on what port and only relays to the correct port
[06:01] <Stephini> ahh so a switch is a much smarter hub...my teacher prolly tried to explain that...but when he was telling me that i was still self teaching basic on a vtech laptop.
[06:02] <jazzkutya> Stephini: in the old days switches were more expensive because of this intelligence, nowdays i don't think you see a hub anywhere
[06:03] <Stephini> lolz jazz i wouldn't be so sure... i work IT in south dakota...this place is so back water i wouldn't be surprised to still find hubs in places that really should advance further...
[06:03] <jazzkutya> :)
[06:03] <Stephini> we still cant use a credit card for boarding the bus or reactivating our bus pass.
[06:03] <jazzkutya> we neiither...
[06:04] <jazzkutya> but we are in central europe
[06:04] <Stephini> they only recently upgraded to mag strip bus passes which they OHH SO CLEVERLY *is that enough sarcasm?* call "flash cards"
[06:04] <jazzkutya> oh &*&@*$*%
[06:04] <Stephini> doesn't europe have a continental transit system atleast?
[06:04] <jazzkutya> they are ahead of us! :(
[06:05] <Stephini> wow i've seen euro bus passes that had RFID where do you live that they dont even have mag strip?
[06:05] <jazzkutya> right here in the capital city of Hungary, Budapest local public transportation still uses paper tickets and paper passes
[06:06] <Stephini> wtf
[06:06]  * Stephini quickly strikes hungary off of her dream "travel eurasia" map.
[06:06] <west> how to I reset my default browser
[06:06] <Tex_Nick> Stephini : about the only advantage for using a hub nowdays is if you want to monitor ALL network traffic with a packet sniffer such as wireshark
[06:06] <Stephini> west most browsers (if you mean internet browsers anyway) have that in their options.
[06:07] <Stephini> Tex_Nick, so like if you are the head IT guy at a school or government agency and want to be sure your students/employees/clients aren't being naughty?
[06:09] <jazzkutya> Stephini: that's one example. you can use sniffing for debugging too :)
[06:09] <Stephini> altho in those cases it seems you could just have your server running a traffic log really.
[06:09] <Tex_Nick> Stephini : yeah or to see if you have virus traffic on the net or to deiagnose network problems
[06:10]  * Stephini bites jazzkutya for reminding her that even using UE3 she'll prolly hafta do network programming.
[06:10] <Tex_Nick> diagnose*
[06:10] <mojtaba> Hi, Does anybody know how can I change my gmail password in Thunderbird?
[06:10] <archigos> Anybody mind taking a look to see what stupid thing I'm doing wrong trying to bring up an IPv6 Lo interface?  3 line paste here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1526523/
[06:10] <mojtaba> I am pretty new to ubuntu and Thunderbird
[06:10] <jazzkutya> network programming is fun
[06:10] <archigos> and fyi, no, I'm not really trying to put x's in an IPv6 address.
[06:10]  * Stephini bites jazzkutya for being nutters.
[06:10] <mojtaba> Hi, Does anybody know how can I change my gmail password in Thunderbird?
[06:10] <Stephini> i loath databasing and networking.
[06:11] <paul__> I'm using Ubuntu desktop (I think 11.5)  and it keeps freezing completely!  Only my mouse moves.  I think it maybe only while playing a flash game on facebook, but not sure.
[06:11] <Stephini> give me good old fashioned logic anyday.
[06:11] <mojtaba> I could not find the answer from googling
[06:11] <jazzkutya> at  least on linux it is fun, on windows i don't know but i guess NOT :)
[06:11] <mojtaba> please help
[06:11] <kepler> mojtaba, open thunderbird, go to tools > accounts > find yours > edit or modify
[06:12] <Stephini> mojtaba you mean change the actual password on the account? if so i think you hafta do it on the site. if you mean just hte password that thunderbird knows then you want to right click on the account in the account browser and edit it... a password feild will be there.
[06:12] <dr_willis> paul__:  theres no 11.5, you can determina youf version via the following
[06:12] <dr_willis> !version | paul
[06:12] <ubottu> paul: To find out what version of Ubuntu you have, type « lsb_release -a » in a !shell - To know the available version of a package, « apt-cache policy <package> »
[06:12] <Seven_Six_Two> mojtaba, I believe just sending and receiving should do it. When it finds that it has an incorrect one stored, it should prompt.
[06:12] <mojtaba> There is no accounts under tools in Thunderbird
[06:13] <mojtaba> It did not promote
[06:13] <mojtaba> prompt
[06:13] <paul__> 12.04
[06:13] <dr_willis> bbl
[06:13] <kepler> check under edit > settings. it is somewhere
[06:13] <Seven_Six_Two> mojtaba, is it a gmail account?
[06:13] <mojtaba> yes
[06:14] <Seven_Six_Two> mojtaba, what happens when you try to send a mail?
[06:14] <kepler> i assume you changed your password on gmail.com and need to fix it in thunderbird
[06:14] <mojtaba> How is it possible, I have changed the password from gmail. but thunderbird does have the old password, but still working?????
[06:14] <mojtaba> !!!
[06:15] <jon655> you have to log out all other sessions
[06:15] <mojtaba> but my mobile asked me for a new password
[06:15] <jon655> if you wait 24 and click refresh, it will stop getting emails
[06:16] <kepler> log into gmail.com with your old password, i think it will say "hey, you changed your password from this. try a new one" -- may give some leeway like that for pop3/imap clients
[06:16] <mojtaba> but thunderbird did not ask?
[06:16] <mojtaba> !
[06:16] <mojtaba> I can not log-in in gmail with my old password
[06:17] <Seven_Six_Two> mojtaba, if you close thunderbird and reopen it?
[06:17] <mojtaba> and also can not receive emails with my phone with old passwords.
[06:17] <kepler> i dunno. looks like you put your new password in
[06:17] <mojtaba> I will try it, but actually I am using thunderbird to chat with you
[06:17] <mojtaba> no
[06:17] <mojtaba> I did not put my new password in thunderbird
[06:17] <mojtaba> but it is stil receiving my emails
[06:18] <mojtaba> I send an email with my another account and it just received it!!!
[06:18] <Seven_Six_Two> mojtaba, you can switch to another client, or the webclient?
[06:18] <mojtaba> what do you mean by client?
[06:18] <jon655> log out all other sessions
[06:18] <xibalba> hello, does anyone know if i can deploy the ubuntuCloud under vmware for testing? i wanted to follow this document : https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ubuntucloud.html
[06:18] <mojtaba> you mean gmail sessions?
=== atrius is now known as atrius_away
[06:19] <Seven_Six_Two> mojtaba, a program that will connect you to irc, like Xchat or irssi.
[06:19] <mojtaba> but how it is possible to receive new mails, because actually it has in its catch the old password!
[06:20] <Seven_Six_Two> mojtaba, yes, you should restart thunderbird, because it holds the authentication for the session
[06:20] <kepler> you may have a session opened already
[06:20] <mojtaba> I will exit thunderbird, and I will come back
[06:20] <mojtaba> I may be disconnected from this conversation
[06:20] <mojtaba> but I will come back
[06:20] <mojtaba> thanks for the moment
[06:21] <mojtaba> Hi guys
[06:21] <mojtaba> It worked.
[06:22] <mojtaba> You were right
[06:22] <naftilos76> hi everyone, does printing a lot of pages save temp file anywhere in /var or anyplace else? I have been printing all day yesterday and probably today too and i got a message that "the Root filesystem is running low on free space" or something like that.
[06:22] <mojtaba> It just asked about the new password.
[06:22] <mojtaba> Thank you very much for your support.
[06:22] <mojtaba> have a good time.
=== amoxibos is now known as reuf
[06:23] <xibalba> anyone have any input on ubuntu cloud under vmware?
[06:24] <Stephini> hey less newby people: is there any way once i have my OSes installed to rig wine and play on linux to read the programs i have installed on my windows partition instead of having to install them anew?
[06:24] <b1lly> so
[06:24] <b1lly> I somehow uninstalled all the core applications with ubuntu 12.04lts
[06:25] <b1lly> anyway to reinstall them quickly
[06:25] <xibalba> hello, does anyone know if i can deploy the ubuntuCloud under vmware for testing? i wanted to follow this document : https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ubuntucloud.html
[06:25] <Seven_Six_Two> Stephini, unlikely, but that's just a gut feeling.
[06:26] <PatrickDickey> b1lly: by core applications, do you mean things like libreoffice, thunderbird, etc, or the ubuntu desktop itself?
[06:26] <b1lly> i think its the ubuntu desktop
[06:26] <b1lly> like everything in my  /Applications/ folder
[06:26] <defekt> Stephini: edit fstab to automount your fat/ntfs drive then with wine navigate to the file you wish to run
=== john__ is now known as __j0hn__
[06:26] <b1lly> is missing
[06:27] <jazzkutya> Stephini: i don't recommend that, it may cause problems in your windows
[06:27] <PatrickDickey> b1lly: you could try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop.
[06:28] <marz_> How can I determine if Ubuntu is recognizing my Video Card?
[06:28] <PatrickDickey> b1lly: do you remember what you did before they disappeared though?
[06:28] <b1lly> not really i was trying to fix my video card
[06:28] <PatrickDickey> marz, what kind of video card is it?
[06:28] <b1lly> so i was doing a bunch of stuff
[06:28] <b1lly> i think i uninstalled unity and compiz and some other stuff
[06:28] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, did you rm -rf?
[06:28] <b1lly> definitly not
[06:29] <Stephini> i was plannign on having 3 partitions... 1 for each OS then a third for storing all the stuff they both will need to access...hopefully tha twont cause a problem...i'm working with a tiny little 120GB
[06:29] <defekt> marz_: lspci |grep -i vga
[06:29] <PatrickDickey> I'd say try reinstalling ubuntu-desktop (the command I gave earlier).
[06:29] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, +1 on PatrickDickey
[06:29] <marz_> defekt: I think it is since it is listing my 2 video cards. Is that right?
[06:30] <b1lly> i just did and no dice
[06:30] <b1lly> do i need to reboot?
[06:30] <PatrickDickey> log out and log back in b1lly.
[06:30] <jazzkutya> Stephini: that seems a good approach. don't forget you need a separate swap partition for linux
[06:30] <jazzkutya> Stephini: and unfortunately there is no good solution to access a filesystem from both systems.
[06:30] <Stephini> swap partiotion...that's sorta like window's cache file...no?
[06:31] <PatrickDickey> Like the page file yes.
[06:31] <jazzkutya> Stephini: not cache, pagefile.sys
[06:31] <Seven_Six_Two> Stephini, how much memory?
[06:31] <Stephini> yeah thta's what i was thinking...i'm a git remember.
[06:31] <defekt> marz_: I guess so you you have 2 video cards? one might ge an igpu
[06:31] <Stephini> erm...on the craptop...maybe 1 or 2 GB
[06:31] <b1lly> so that didnt work
[06:31] <b1lly> also
[06:32] <b1lly> what is ubuntu-desktop btw
[06:32] <PatrickDickey> Try rebooting then b1lly. Ubuntu-desktop is Unity.
[06:32] <defekt> unity
[06:32] <xibalba> kvm-ok ?
[06:32] <marz_> defekt: I think my laptop is using the optimus technology something. I already installed the bumblebee project for it. :D
[06:32] <xibalba> not found
[06:32] <jon655> its the normal Ubuntu Download b1lly
[06:32] <b1lly> and what is unity
[06:32] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, it's a metapackage, but you might need to purge it first?
[06:32] <b1lly> just so i understand
[06:32] <Tex_Nick> Stephini : have you asked in #winehq ... that channel is usually not very active, but sometimes you find a guru there
[06:33] <b1lly> ok ill try to restart
[06:33] <b1lly> shud i purge first?
[06:33] <Seven_Six_Two> removing (or reinstalling) metapackages doesn't remove all of the packages that it depends on
[06:33] <Stephini> Tex_Nick, no i haven't the question was mainly just a spur of the moment thought
[06:33] <defekt> marz_: well the video card has been picked up as it is showing in lspci, if you want to go further you can check to make sure the module is loaded by typing lsmod
[06:33] <PatrickDickey> Try restarting, and if that doesn't work, then try purge.  It'll be sudo apt-get purge ubuntu-desktop.
[06:33] <Seven_Six_Two> deleting the files doesn't uninstall it according to dpkg
[06:33] <jazzkutya> Stephini: i went for 2 big storage partitions btw, one ntfs and one ext3 but I have a 2T hdd :)
[06:33] <Tex_Nick> Stephini : yeah i have those all the time ;-)
[06:33] <b1lly> what does purging do
[06:34] <b1lly> im assuming removes all traces of it
[06:34] <PatrickDickey> b1lly: purge removes everything, including any configuration files.
[06:34] <BillyZane> so many questions floating around all at once, i guess i'll wait
[06:34] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, removes config files...hang on a sec..
[06:34] <defekt> BillyZane: correct
[06:34] <defekt> sry i meant b1lly
[06:34] <b1lly> so is unity just a bundle of applications for ubuntu?
[06:34] <Seven_Six_Two> but you need to remove the metapackage's dependencies and reinstall them.
[06:35] <marz_> defekt: I got the results from lsmod, what am I supposed to do after?
[06:35] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, unity is an interface
[06:35] <b1lly> i see, the interface is working fine tho?
[06:35] <b1lly> i just dont have anything in my /Applications/ folder
[06:35] <jazzkutya> b1lly: ubuntu-desktop is a bundle of applications for ubuntu (including the unity desktop too)
[06:35] <BillyZane> hi Defaultti
[06:35] <defekt> marz_: that's just to see what modules are loaded. Are you having a problem with loading xwindows?
[06:35] <BillyZane> errr defekt
[06:36] <Stephini> lolz jazz. wanna buy me a 2TB? :P
[06:36] <b1lly> ah
[06:36] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, what is the full path of your applications folder?
[06:36] <b1lly> I was also
[06:36] <jazzkutya> Stephini: sorry, I'm poor since the hdd :)
[06:36] <b1lly> /Home/Applications
[06:36] <Stephini> lolz i can imagine why
[06:36] <b1lly> i think
[06:36] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, and what is normally there?
[06:36] <marz_> defekt: Guess I better read a book about linux, I'm not following you. I'm sorry. Hehehe
[06:36] <b1lly> a bunch of stuff
[06:36] <defekt> BillyZane: sorry tabbed the wrong name earlier
[06:36] <b1lly> custom apps (like eclipse)
[06:37] <b1lly> and other things
[06:37] <BillyZane> defekt: no problem
[06:37] <hmsck> hello,  how can i change my wireless from *G mode to *B mode please?
[06:37] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, aah. my mistake for misunderstanding. I thought you were talking about stuff installed with package manager.
[06:38] <b1lly> there were a bunch of default apps there
[06:38] <paul__> I'm using Ubuntu desktop 12.04  and it keeps freezing completely!  Only my mouse moves.  I think it maybe only while playing a flash game on facebook, but not sure.
[06:38] <b1lly> when i first installed ubuntu
[06:38] <defekt> marz_: lol it's all good :) We will try to help where we can :)
[06:38] <marz_> defekt: I'm glad to know that. :D
[06:39] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, I've had Ubuntu since Feisty, and I don't think I've ever had an applications folder in my home folder. I'm assuming that you mean /home/b1lly/Applications
[06:39] <marz_> defekt: Just to clarify, x windows system is different from kde and gnome right? If it is then I'm using the gnome , the default desktop og Ubuntu 12.10 :D
[06:39] <b1lly> probably
[06:39] <Seven_Six_Two> marz_, no, they are different things.
[06:40] <jon655> Seven_Six_Two: I think the one before Natty narwhal had it
[06:40] <defekt> marz_: xwindows/xorg is what the desktop managers sit on/use. such as unity gnome kde xfce openbox etc
[06:40] <b1lly> ua
[06:40] <marz_> Seven_Six_Two: Oh Okay.
[06:40] <b1lly> ua
[06:40] <b1lly> ya
[06:40] <FloodBot1> b1lly: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[06:40] <marz_> defekt: I really should grab a book about linux. Hahahaha
[06:41] <Seven_Six_Two> Maverick? I had that, but maybe it was only on new installs?
[06:41] <Seven_Six_Two> marz_, if you buy 1, I recommend the one with a pink cover (and cartoons)
[06:41] <b1lly> anyway
[06:42] <b1lly> thanks for help
[06:42] <b1lly> goin to bed
[06:42] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, have you  checked the trash?
[06:42] <b1lly> no
[06:43] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, do you need directions?
[06:43] <BillyZane> is his bed in the trash?
[06:43] <b1lly> no
[06:43] <marz_> Seven_Six_Two: I didn't understand that, but I'm guessing that it is a joke. Is that right?
[06:43] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, nautilus or thunar should have a link to it.
[06:43] <b1lly> but I did find eclipse in there :P
[06:43] <Seven_Six_Two> marz_, about the book? no, it's not a joke.
[06:44] <BillyZane> lol b1lly
[06:44] <marz_> Seven_Six_Two: the one with a pink cover (and cartoons)? What's the name of the book?
[06:44] <Seven_Six_Two> marz_, I'm not affiliated in any way, but there is a very well known linux book that has a pink cover.
[06:44] <BillyZane> b1lly, what do you prefer over eclipse?
[06:44] <BillyZane> i just installed codeblocks, i like
[06:44] <BillyZane> i haven't tried eclipse though
[06:44] <BillyZane> i find java to be repugnant
[06:44] <Seven_Six_Two> marz_, Linux Administration Handbook
[06:45] <b1lly> I don't atm, have a preference over eclipse
[06:45] <b1lly> I use the aptana extension for eclipse
[06:45] <b1lly> I do use emacs a bunch but
[06:45] <b1lly> eclipse is a pretty powerful ide
[06:45] <BillyZane> i'm super n00b
[06:45] <BillyZane> i hear it is good
[06:45] <marz_> Seven_Six_Two: Okay, I'll try to look into it. I was looking forward to the "Running Linux (5th Edition) book by O'Reilly
[06:46] <BillyZane> my friend who is a CS major recommended eclipse
[06:46] <b1lly> yeah, we all use it at work
[06:46] <Mikel> Hello all
[06:46] <BillyZane> why?
[06:46] <b1lly> our software is java based
[06:46] <Seven_Six_Two> marz_, hopefully you get to see them before you buy!
[06:46] <b1lly> but also, it's got some great utility
[06:46] <BillyZane> ohh
[06:46] <BillyZane> b1lly, in what way
[06:47] <BillyZane> well, i presume you can code in java in clipse
[06:47] <BillyZane> eclipse
[06:47] <Seven_Six_Two> you verily can
[06:47] <Seven_Six_Two> C as well
[06:47] <BillyZane> sweet
[06:47] <b1lly> yeah, it has built in compilers
[06:47] <BillyZane> ohhhh
[06:47] <b1lly> you can jump through functions and classes and data types very easily
[06:47] <BillyZane> i see how that could be desireable
[06:47] <b1lly> navigate through code easily
[06:47] <BillyZane> hmmm..........
[06:47] <BillyZane> that makes me squirm with desire
[06:48] <Mikel> Please I've upgraded to ubuntu 12.10 and since then, my eclipse is now displaying only CVS and General in wizard.   PLZ  HELP
[06:48] <Seven_Six_Two> it's a demanding ide though..
[06:48] <b1lly> you can simply ctrl+click a function();
[06:48] <b1lly> and it will take you to the declaration
[06:48] <b1lly> same for classs or data types
[06:48] <marz_> Seven_Six_Two: Thanks for suggesting a book. :D
[06:48] <BillyZane> b1lly, that sounds useful
[06:48] <b1lly> yeah, theres a bunch of cool stuff
[06:48] <BillyZane> b1lly, i just installed my first C editor
[06:48] <BillyZane> so i don't know
[06:48] <Seven_Six_Two> lots of menus and things. There's something to be said about being able to do it by hand first!
[06:49] <BillyZane> you remember that simpson's episode where homer falls asleep at the truck, and the truck drives itself? does eclipse code itself?
[06:49] <Tex_Nick> 12.10 gnome classic ... right click on desktop & check "Keep Aligned" ... icons are aligned horizontally but not vertically ... can i align them all in a grid fashion ?
[06:49] <b1lly> eclipse will
[06:49] <hmsck> how can i change my wireless from *G mode to *B mode please?
[06:49] <b1lly> auto complete
[06:49] <b1lly> and can help auto import classes and such
[06:50] <Seven_Six_Two> b1lly, autocomplete is the devil.
[06:50] <BillyZane> right now it is Seven_Six_Two
[06:50] <b1lly> it doesnt auto complete the way you think, but recommends with a select box
[06:50] <BillyZane> but imagine auto complete in 30 years
[06:50] <b1lly> so you can continue to type
[06:50] <b1lly> its great when you
[06:50] <b1lly> wanna see what methods blah.object.
[06:50] <b1lly> has
[06:50] <b1lly> access too
[06:50] <b1lly> it will show you all the functions you can call
[06:51] <Seven_Six_Two> that's true. It's easier than using a book or website
[06:51] <b1lly> hmm?
[06:52] <b1lly> im saying if you create a class with a bunch of methods -- and then instantiate and object, you can see what methods you can invoke on that object by just typing "object."      and it will list all the methods
[06:52] <b1lly> when you work with big software and lots of code
[06:52] <b1lly> especially code you didnt right
[06:52] <b1lly> its really helpful
[06:53] <b1lly> didnt write*
[06:53] <b1lly> anyway im to sleepy im making alot of typos
[06:53] <b1lly> thanks for the help guys
[06:53] <b1lly> ill be back tmrw
[06:54] <BillyZane> you're welcome b1lly, it's so great when people appreciate my help
[06:54] <BillyZane> so
[06:54] <BillyZane> am i next on the endless queue?
[06:55] <BillyZane> real simple, this is 2+2 stuff for you guys
=== ubuntu__ is now known as Guest73055
[06:55] <BillyZane> lets say i want to access my home ubuntu computer
[06:55] <BillyZane> from school
[06:55] <Guest73055> what r u ssaying
[06:55] <BillyZane> does ubuntu come with telnet, ssh services
[06:56] <BillyZane> like... can i log on to ubuntu from school through ssh
[06:56] <BillyZane> 1) does that functionality come natively or do i have to install a program
[06:56] <BillyZane> 2) can i open up a GUI interface through SSH/telnet , such as eclipse
[06:56] <SolarisBoy> sure
[06:56] <Guest73055> how can i record sound
[06:57] <BillyZane> so, it will have some internet lag, but it would be just like being at home?
[06:57] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: maybe - you need to be sure your host is accessible externally
[06:57] <BillyZane> how do i do that?
[06:57] <SolarisBoy> for ssh client and server you can install "ssh"
[06:57] <BillyZane> oh i see
[06:58] <BillyZane> so it doesn't come with those features
[06:58] <BillyZane> i have to install ssh, and then configure ssh
=== `mOOse` is now known as m00se
[06:58] <SolarisBoy> if your behind a router or something your host will need to have ports forwarded through NAT so the internal IP and it's resource(s) are available to the internet.
[06:58] <BillyZane> hmm ok
[06:58] <BillyZane> i suppose those ports would be specified in the ssh client program
[06:58] <SolarisBoy> you don't really need to configure ssh unless you plan on doing something other than standard auth like using keys and such
[06:59] <BillyZane> err server that is
[06:59] <BillyZane> oh
[06:59] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: by default ssh listens on port 22 - you can change it in the sshd_config file
[06:59] <BillyZane> i just want to be able to access a programming environment
[06:59] <SolarisBoy> you would probably want to put it on a non standard port if it's just for you to access and you want to be a little safer
[06:59] <BillyZane> that's a good point
[07:00] <BillyZane> it would be just for me or a few other people ( doubt it, but it's possible )
[07:00] <BillyZane> problem is, at this moment i have ubuntu on a virtualbo
[07:00] <BillyZane> box
[07:01] <BillyZane> i want to transition to full time linux user
[07:01] <BillyZane> that's another big question i have
[07:01] <SolarisBoy> you could still do it technically. assuming said virtual box guest instance was using bridged networking and assigned a working IP from your router or whatever is doing DHCP on your LAN
[07:01] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: you can start gui programs with ssh but it will be awfully slow. if you really need that you should learn and tweak a textmode editor like vim or emacs
[07:01] <BillyZane> my router might detect it then
[07:02] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, that's good to know. damn it, school starts thursday
[07:02] <BillyZane> i need to get everything up and running by then
[07:02] <SolarisBoy> you can also use compression and different encryption/hash algo's to make ssh faster
[07:03] <BillyZane> 1 hour ago, i did not know what ssh was, is this something that is easy to do
[07:03] <SolarisBoy> and do other things like disable reverse lookups - as long as the it's not a huge app it works fine - but yes there can/may be latency going over the inet
=== asd is now known as Guest37273
[07:03] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: sudo apt-get install ssh .. after that it works
[07:03] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: depending on net connection maybe it won't be that slow, you have to test. and using vnc can be better than ssh
[07:03] <BillyZane> let me check the router to see if the virtualbox has its own IP
[07:03] <jazzkutya> regarding speed and responsiveness
[07:03] <jazzkutya> security is a different point :)
[07:04] <SolarisBoy> i make sure anything going into my network through my router is in a tunnel
[07:04] <jazzkutya> yes vnc with an ssh or other secure tunnel is good
[07:04] <SolarisBoy> yep
[07:04] <BillyZane> one sec, let me process everyone's words
[07:05] <BillyZane> i can use compression to increase speed, i have pretty good upload speeds though, maybe 200-250 kb/sec
[07:05] <SolarisBoy> ssh -c
[07:05] <BillyZane> i can use a text based system also, that is very viable, but i feel it might make things slower
[07:06] <BillyZane> hmm..... let m write that down
[07:06] <SolarisBoy> not if you use vim =)
[07:06] <BillyZane> does vim use a mouse?
[07:06] <BillyZane> is it a GUI?
[07:06] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: it can
[07:06] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: it does have a gui fork called gvim
[07:06] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: easy with that statement, vim and emacs are hell to learn :) and with vim i don't know autocomplete solutions
[07:06] <BillyZane> gvim....
[07:07] <SolarisBoy> or maybe it's not a fork i guess it's just a part of the vim app
[07:07] <BillyZane> vim is the famous vi editor?
[07:07] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : jazzkutya has a good point there ... i've used VNC for years for many things such as monitoring security cams ... it's pretty fast and has good encryption ... worth looking ... easy to setup also
[07:07] <SolarisBoy> vim = VI improved
[07:07] <jazzkutya> with gvim you are back to the problem of a gui program being slow with ssh (if it is slow, test needed)
[07:07] <BillyZane> hmm, nice
[07:07] <SolarisBoy> so yes in general BillyZane
[07:08] <SolarisBoy> i don't think gvim would be that slow but yea you would definately gain speed by sticking to console apps over ssh
[07:08] <SolarisBoy> rememeber tunnels are going to slow things down as well - with encryption and all
[07:08] <BillyZane> a VNC is a good option, but the problem is that my school computers don't allow you to install software, and i doubt they have a VNC installed. but given that they hav efedora, i guess there's probably an SSH or a terminal program on there i could use. i can't guarantee their computers have the software i want installed
[07:09] <SolarisBoy> hmm
=== sgerbino is now known as p1und3r
=== nick is now known as Guest43354
[07:09] <BillyZane> i can see if they could unlock the computers
[07:09] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: you may want to check on the droid market if it's applicable to you
[07:10] <SolarisBoy> im sure they have some vnc and ssh clients there as well
[07:10] <BillyZane> i would be using my phone though right?
[07:10] <BillyZane> i'd prefer to work on a desktop
[07:10] <SolarisBoy> or tablet maybe
[07:10] <SolarisBoy> sure - understandable
[07:10] <BillyZane> i have apple stuff
[07:11] <BillyZane> they have free telnet apps that are decent
[07:11] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: you can also try to see if they have statically compiled binaries of vnc clients
[07:11] <SolarisBoy> drop it on a thumbdrive if they do and run it from there
[07:11] <BillyZane> hmm... can i run it from a thumb drive?
[07:11] <BillyZane> ahhh
[07:11] <BillyZane> so, can i run apps from a USB drive?
[07:12] <SolarisBoy> sure - assuming the app is not dependant on things on the system
[07:12] <BillyZane> i don't really know why i want to connect to my home computer
[07:12] <SolarisBoy> lol
[07:12] <jazzkutya> btw interesting alternative to vnc is teamviewer, a proprietary app that sells for money but afaik free for personal noncommercial use with it it is even possible (technically) to play games remotely on a windows machine. framerate is pretty unplayable but still surprisingly fast
[07:12] <BillyZane> maybe i could just load the apps i want to use on the thumb drive
[07:13] <SolarisBoy> yea i heard of a few people using teamviewer also seems pretty cool
[07:13] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : with VNC for a client ... you might look at TeamViewer ... http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx?pid=google.r.us.s.desk.vnc&gclid=CISgkczj5LQCFS-RPAodMlwA9g
[07:13] <BillyZane> if it can work with games, that's pretty impressive
[07:13] <SolarisBoy> or atleast am option
[07:13] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick, i'm checking it out. right now i use tightVNC
[07:13] <dfgmme> why can't i find a data usage app for ubuntu ?
[07:13] <jazzkutya> and teamviewer installation is not required
[07:13] <SolarisBoy> data usage app?
[07:13] <dfgmme> data usage monitor
[07:14] <BillyZane> can i ask 1 more question?
[07:14] <SolarisBoy> like a system monitor or data on drives?
[07:14] <BillyZane> i'll wait till dfgmme has his answered...
[07:14] <jazzkutya> meaning it can be started from anywhere (home directory), at least on windows, never tested it on linux without installation
[07:14] <skp1> can someone help me? when i select ubuntu from the grub menu i get a blank screen and i have to switch to tty1 and do startx, and when i do that i just get a wallpaper with no launcher or panel
[07:15] <dfgmme> data usage monitor means internet
[07:15] <doctorly> is there an easy way to write and test python in tty? (somethine like a python shell?)
[07:15] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: really? new to me..
[07:15] <dfgmme> internet data usage monitor
[07:16] <jazzkutya> startx! never heard this since a lot of years :)
[07:16] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: they have a few "data monitors" iftop is ok
[07:16] <SolarisBoy> depends on the data your interested in -
[07:16] <Tex_Nick> skp1 : what distro are you using
[07:16] <skp1> Tex_Nick: ubuntu 12.10
[07:17] <xibalba> hello, does anyone know if i can deploy the ubuntuCloud under vmware for testing? i wanted to follow this document : https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/ubuntucloud.html
[07:17] <SolarisBoy> in fact dfgmme if you open the dash and type "monitor" the default ubuntu install provides "System Monitor" which on the lower most portion has Network History with a graph of up/down by MiB/s
[07:18] <Tex_Nick> skp1 : what graphics are you using
[07:18] <skp1> Tex_Nick: amd radeon 6300
[07:19] <dfgmme> Solari i want the want to can record monthly data usage
[07:19] <BillyZane> hello
[07:19] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: look into sar
[07:19] <BillyZane> you guys...... big big question...
=== mike_ is now known as Guest11863
[07:19] <Tex_Nick> skp1 : is this a new install ... or were you able to boot at one time
[07:19] <BillyZane> i got ubuntu on a virtualbox, i like it a lot. it's utopia
[07:20] <BillyZane> now i want it on its own partition so i can fully experience it
[07:20] <skp1> Tex_Nick: i was able to boot at one time
[07:20] <donttrustem> Mornings
[07:20] <BillyZane> i've been told i can have it on NTFS, i could have it on its own partition, or i could give it several partitions, such as root, home, swap, and possibly 1 more
[07:21] <BillyZane> what do i do
[07:21] <BillyZane> this is confusing me to death
=== mike___ is now known as _mikem_
[07:21] <BillyZane> i don't want 3 or 4 partitions for this OS, that's ridiculous
[07:21] <dgreeley> you can leave it in it's VM, no different than having it on its own really
[07:21] <BillyZane> i would prefer it all on one, why would i want more
[07:21] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: is there an existing OS on the system you want it installed on?
=== mike___ is now known as mikem_87
[07:22] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, yes windows 7 is on C drive
[07:22] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: OK
[07:22] <dfgmme> why there isn't any standalone app that record data usage ? windows have tons of that
[07:22] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: there are tons
[07:22] <nightfly> BillyZane: you can always put it on one partition, it wont care
=== mike___ is now known as mikem_87
[07:22] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: sar is probably one of the most widely used on a linux system
[07:23] <fredduz> ciaoooooooooooooooo
[07:23] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: yea your best bet would be to run the ubuntu installer and allow it to resize the windows partition and install ubuntu to the new space on a one partition setup
[07:23] <BillyZane> i was told that i should have them separated because it makes it easier to update the OS
[07:23] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: along with what nightfly said, you'll most likely have two partitions. / (which is root) and /swap (which is like pagefile.sys on Windows). You'll only *use* the / partition though. the swap will be handled by the system.
[07:23] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: you should also ensure to backup your stuff first
[07:23] <dfgmme> i don't see sar on sfotware center
[07:24] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: you can forget the several partitions, except maybe the swap but even that can be solvable. I wouldn't put it on ntfs
[07:24] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, there's nothing important on this computer, i have a second that has all my files on a network
[07:24] <Tex_Nick> !nomodeset | skp1
[07:24] <ubottu> skp1: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[07:24] <SolarisBoy> in that case acquire the boot media load it up and follow the prompts BillyZane
[07:24] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: That's only if you do clean installs for every upgrade. And in that case, you'd probably only want /home on a separate partition, as that's where your documents and stuff will be. (just my .02 worth).
[07:24] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, i have a gargantuan amount of hard disk space that i can dedicate to this effort. how much space should i give this partition such that no swap would be needed?
[07:25] <SolarisBoy> the default install will ask you clearly if you want to side by side install and then it will clearly allow you to choose the size you want windows reduced to - so it's not to hard and it's a good task for learning in your case
[07:25] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, i think that is a valuable 2 cents
[07:25] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: no, that depends on the ammount of ram you have in your machine
[07:25] <donttrustem> I am using this syntax https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AspireOne/AO751h which worked when I used the e command in the grub menu.  I then added it to the  /etc/default/grub and updated but  it does not work I still get a black screen. At bootup.   I have check the config  using the e command and it  has been added but will not. Work?
[07:25] <BillyZane> i have 16gb of ram
[07:25] <BillyZane> which i plan to upgrade to 32
[07:25] <dfgmme> i can't find one ...........................................................
[07:25] <dfgmme> for weeeeeks
[07:25] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: swap is depending on memory. In that case, you probably don't need swap. Unless you're running a crapload of memory intensive applications.
[07:25] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: sar is one
[07:26] <skp1> Tex_Nick: i edited /etc/default/grub
[07:26] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: you don't need a different swap partition. anyway linux can use a file as swap also if needed later
[07:26] <SolarisBoy> swap used to be dependant on memory like 2x or something but it would be ridiculous to have a 64GB swap file because you had 32GB nowadays
[07:26] <SolarisBoy> jazzkutya: right on
[07:27] <Syria> Hello! I want to search for the location of the virtual machine file using the terminal !
[07:27] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, so can i have the swap file in the /home folder?
[07:27] <dfgmme> solarisboy i can't find it on the software center
[07:27] <SolarisBoy> Syria: what are you using for virtualization?
[07:27]  * donttrustem is struggling to get this working .... And it's the wife netbook :(
[07:28] <PatrickDickey> Syria, do you know the name of the virtual machine? If so, you can try sudo updatedb && locate <name> This is assuming of course, that you're looking for the actual file on a physical hard drive.
[07:28] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i can resize C drive? can i make it larger? and also, can i remove the NTFS partition i have on my second partition?
[07:28] <jazzkutya> btw how does ubuntu resize the windows partition when around mid-last year the then-latest ntfs-3d choked on an ntfs for me that had no errors according to windows checkdisk?
[07:28] <subcool> hey- how do i resize NTFS with gparted?
[07:29] <subcool> i installed gparted, im supposed to also install something else right?
[07:29] <Syria> PatrickDickey:  yes i know the name of it and the problem has been solved :) I have used sudo find / -name 'name of the machine'
[07:29] <subcool> i cant find a guide that says it-.
[07:29] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: you can have the swap file anywhere, but i think you won't need any at all with 16/32g ram
[07:29] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: what i want to do is add more space to C drive and then canibalize space that I have on my second partition. however, will this effect the data that is on C drive?
[07:29] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: from the standard installer no but from possibly the alternative or using a gparted CD first to do the heavy stuff and then allowing the ubuntu installer to pick up the partitions/disks
[07:29] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: not sure about NTFS drives like that - =)
[07:29] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: you might want to resize the partition in Windows. Just to be safe.
[07:29] <dfgmme> sad...........................................
[07:29] <BillyZane> jazzkutya: i was planning on eventually running molecular dynamics applications though, so it might end up needing it
[07:30] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: patience is a virtue
[07:30] <Syria> PatrickDickey:  Thank you.
[07:30] <PatrickDickey> No problem Syria. Glad I was able to help. :)
[07:30] <PatrickDickey> And glad you were able to get the name.
[07:30] <jazzkutya> well then right after installing you should make a 32gigs swapfile, I'd recomment at the root directory
[07:31] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, i agree, patience is undervalued
[07:31] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, so if i use gparted from perhaps a USB drive, i can resize C drive?
[07:31] <skp1> can someone help me? when i select ubuntu from the grub menu i get a blank screen and i have to switch to tty1 and do startx, and when i do that i just get a wallpaper with no launcher or panel
[07:31] <BillyZane> without damaging the files on C drive that is
[07:31] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: the sar utility is part of the "sysstat" package if you were interested in using it
[07:31] <jazzkutya> dd if=/dev/null of=/swapfile bs=1024k count=32768
[07:31] <BillyZane> jazzkutya: ok, so i place it on the root directory, and if i do that, can i enlarge the size of the swapfile later?
[07:32] <jazzkutya> yes
[07:32] <nightfly> BillyZane: Some modern Windows will let you resize the C drive from the "disk management" utility directly
[07:32] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: you put all of that as one line in /etc/default/grub, correct?
[07:32] <jazzkutya> i said right after installation only because it may help if the swapfile is not fragmented
[07:32] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme after your done installing it - take a look at the /etc/default/sysstat and the retentions for data and what type of extra data you can enable
[07:32] <BillyZane> nightfly, good thinking, let me see if i can do that
[07:32] <jazzkutya> but now I'm not sure
[07:32] <BlackDalek> Are there any Q*bert clones for linux? Can anyone give me a name of one so I can look for it?
[07:32] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Yeah
[07:32] <PatrickDickey> skp1: out of curiosity what graphics card do you have?
[07:33] <jazzkutya> any file will work as swap whenever you created, just creating it later _may_ decrease performance
[07:33] <BillyZane> holy crap
[07:33] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: can you copy/paste the /etc/default/grub into a pastebin by chance? Just so we can make sure it's right?
[07:33] <subcool> anyone- please?
[07:33] <BillyZane> nightfly, you're right, i can shrink the volume, but i suppose i could expand the volume also if there was a partition that allowed that, all i gotta do is shrink the second volume then expand the other one
[07:34] <PatrickDickey> One moment subcool. I'm not sure if you can resize it with gparted or not. I'll check.
[07:34] <dfgmme> so it's not a gui app ?
[07:34] <dfgmme> sadddddddddddddddd
[07:34] <subcool> PatrickDickey, i thought i could install a ntfs add on or something
[07:34] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: I am have just dropped into root mode and vi the file and it is correct ..  Cant paste it as the netbook does boot in to  a state where I can use it
[07:34] <Ben64> gparted can resize ntfs
[07:34] <subcool> im on a liveusb - so i dont remember.
[07:35] <BillyZane> hmmm
[07:35] <subcool> Ben64,  i have an explanation point on the parittion. I know i have to install something.. but i forget
[07:35] <SolarisBoy> is the liveusb plugged into the netbook?
[07:35] <subcool> some ntfs thing
[07:35] <subcool> nah laptop
[07:35] <Ben64> subcool: maybe its mounted?
[07:35] <BillyZane> nightfly, i just shrink the D drive's volume, but i can't expand C drive, i think i might have to do it in safe mode or something
[07:35] <SolarisBoy> ok
[07:35] <subcool> Ben64, nah..
[07:35] <Tex_Nick> skp1 : sorry i'm working kinda late ... have a look at this & se if it is similar to what you are experiencing
[07:35] <Tex_Nick> skp1 : sorry, here is link ... http://askubuntu.com/questions/207175/what-does-nomodeset-do
[07:36] <PatrickDickey> subcool this might help you http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-gparted-to-resize-your-windows-vista-partition/
[07:36] <Ben64> subcool: then find out what the exclamation is for, it will tell you.
[07:37] <subcool> Ben64, ah- ops. i thought it was because i didnt isntall sometihng. There is a disk error.
[07:37] <BillyZane> nightfly, i think i know how to do it, i gotta delete D drive
[07:37] <subcool> Stupid me- thanks.
[07:38] <subcool> ill be back. .i have to reboot this thing.
[07:38] <subcool> thanks!!
[07:38] <BillyZane> which is fine cause D drive is empty
[07:38] <jazzkutya> an empty drive is a  happy drive lol
[07:38] <BillyZane> hehe
[07:38] <f03lipe> d
[07:38] <BillyZane> ok, so... i'm expanding C drive
[07:39] <BillyZane> for this ubuntu install, should I keep the space that has no file system the way it is
[07:39] <BillyZane> like... i'll have C drive, then the second drive will not exist
[07:39] <BillyZane> that is, it won't have a file system
[07:39] <jazzkutya> yes
[07:39] <BillyZane> then, when i go in to ubuntu installer, i create 2 partitions
[07:39] <BillyZane> a root partition and a home partition
[07:40] <jazzkutya> ubuntu will create a new partition for itself
[07:40] <dfgmme> solari , awesome IT DOESN'T WORK
[07:40] <BillyZane> you said i should put the swap file in the root partition right
[07:40] <dfgmme> JUST LIKE ALL OTHER SUGGESTIN NOTHING EVER WORK
[07:40] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: wait, why 2 partition? you said you don't want lots of partitions :)
[07:40] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Strange I ran update-grub in recovery mode and it has worked
[07:40] <Ben64> dfgmme: chillax?
[07:40] <dfgmme> damn it is hard man
[07:40] <bazhang> dfgmme, lose caps now
[07:40] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: So now it's booting correctly?
[07:40] <dfgmme> bazhang pls go away i hate you
[07:41] <bazhang> dfgmme, stay on topic here.
[07:41] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, i didn't, but i also would like the most up to date version of ubuntu. a clean install is something i always did when i installed windows and i feel i shouldn't stop what works now
[07:41] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Just testing again
[07:41] <SolarisBoy> how does sysstat not work?
[07:41] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: could you refresh my memory, what's the issue that you're having exactly?
[07:41] <donttrustem> It has booted ok but doing a restart
[07:41]  * SolarisBoy doesn't believe that for 1 second
[07:41] <bazhang> he wants to monitor data usage
[07:41] <SolarisBoy> yes
[07:41] <malkauns> in xpra how do i specify an ssh port?
[07:42] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: i don't understand. I've asked why will you create 2 linux partitions, root and home?
[07:42] <SolarisBoy> well "monitoring data usage" is rather general
[07:42] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: then I'd "do something else" when you go into the installer. Create a partition and format it ext4 and mount it as /. then create a second partition with the same format, and mount it as /home.
[07:42] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, i was told earlier that if you want to do a clean install, a la formatting, it's good to have 2 partitions
[07:42] <Ben64> from sysstat's web page - Extensive network statistics: network interface activity (number of packets and kB received and transmitted per second, etc.) including failures from network devices; network traffic statistics for IP, TCP, ICMP and UDP protocols based on SNMPv2 standards; support for IPv6-related protocols.
[07:42] <bazhang> as is "don't work"
[07:42] <mangdood> Hi, I want to backup my ubuntu partition to try another distro. What's the preferred way for doing this?
[07:43] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, mount it as / ? by that is it / drive?
[07:43] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: how much space will you give to linux total?
[07:43] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: What data usage do you want to monitor?
[07:43] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, that is to be decided but as much as it requires
[07:43] <SolarisBoy> bazhang: good point
[07:43] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, up to 400 gb
[07:43] <PatrickDickey> Yes. It will ask you for a "mount point". the first one will be / (as in root), the second will be /home.
[07:43] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Nope still not working... Still get a black screen
[07:43] <SolarisBoy> i'd just like to say i did mention for him to check /etc/default/sysstat im sure he still has ENABLED="false" and such
[07:44] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: try removing the changes that you made in /etc/default/grub, running update-grub again. Then put them back in the command line (using e). See if it boots that way.
[07:44] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, how will these drives show up on "my computer" (sorry i am very new)
[07:44] <XMLnewbi> whats the best way to copy paste into a ubuntu server on VMware? On ssh putty id use right click but thats not working, ctr v doesnt work either
[07:44] <dfgmme> PatrickDickey , i want a gui app for internet data usage monitor that i can check my monthly data usage
[07:44] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Ok
[07:45] <BillyZane> hmm.. starting to get hungry
[07:45] <mangdood> XMLnewbi: Maybe middle click works?
[07:45] <Nordom> can someone help me out, just installed ubuntu, and it worked fine used skype, and now I dont have sound anymore
[07:45] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: From linux, /home/username will show up as your username. / will show up as File System, and /home will be a subdirectory below that.
[07:46] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, i think that is a good way to do it. / and /home partitions it is.
[07:46] <skp1> Tex_Nick: thank you for your help, i managed to fix it with a sudo update-grub
[07:46] <skp1> Tex_Nick: even though i got some graphic corruption on my first login i logged out and back in and everything was fine
[07:47] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: http://www.iloveubuntu.net/easily-monitor-your-data-download-monitor-ubuntu-software-center might be an idea?
[07:47] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: im guessing ksar isn't up your alley?
[07:47] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Can I use vim from the shell as root
[07:47] <Tex_Nick> skp1 : lol ... how easy could that be ... hey ^5 ;-)
[07:47] <SolarisBoy> http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/identifying-linux-bottlenecks-sar-graphs-with-ksar.html | you run the app and load the sar files and it makes graphs
[07:48] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: I think so. I'm not sure though.
[07:48] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: you can but being root is officially not recommended (i do it anyway)
[07:48] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: Actually I'm pretty sure you can, otherwise you wouldn't be able to fix things. ;)
=== ericab is now known as ericab_away
[07:48] <skp1> Tex_Nick: danke
[07:48] <PatrickDickey> Nordom: When you go into Sound Settings, and test your speakers, do you hear any sounds?
[07:49] <donttrustem> jazzkutya: I am trying to fix a boot loader issue so I need to be in recovery mode
[07:49] <BillyZane> open question. how big should / drive be and how big should /home drive be. swap size: 16gb ram with the possibility of a 32gb total ram in the future
[07:49] <Nordom> PatrickDickey: I am getting 0 sounds
[07:49] <PatrickDickey> Nordom: Does your sound card show up in sound settings?
[07:49] <mangdood> Skype can do some pretty weird things to your sound
[07:49] <Nordom> wait I managed to do it
[07:50] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: oic, full right to be root then :) i guess probably will work but i am not sure as a recovery mode may miss something needed by vim
[07:50] <BillyZane> jazzkutya, i can live with 2 partitions if it means i can do clean installs, i think if i make the /home partition large enough, i won't have to worry about needing additional partitions
[07:50] <Nordom> PatrickDickey: I clicked analog output from the sound settings
[07:50] <Nordom> geting sounds now
[07:50] <PatrickDickey> Did you change that in the Skype settings, by chance?
[07:50] <dfgmme> PatrickDickey .............. can't find download manager in software center ................
[07:50] <dfgmme> soad
[07:50] <dfgmme> sad
[07:50] <donttrustem> jazzkutya: It is I need to use vi :( and cannot remember the commands
[07:50] <Nordom> PatrickDickey: it works, but its a little choppy
[07:50] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: okay do as others suggested i think they know this better than me
[07:51] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: / doesn't have to be large but you should keep in mind that space will be used there as you update/upgrade and install new things - i create VM's with 10GB hdd's which ubuntu installs fine on - however thats probably smaller than you would want to run a system comfortably
[07:51] <BillyZane> jazz, for sure
[07:51] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: Download monitor?
[07:51] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i might be interested in running a windows7 virtualbox in the future. flipping my current configuration
[07:52] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: /home can be as big you'd like - however remember here that a lot of programs are going to put files under your home folder - and that by default this is where things like your music and movies etc go - so you would want to make sure that's big enough to keep all your stuff
[07:52] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: do you  mean vi commands? what command do you need?
[07:52] <dfgmme> the app name is download manager right
[07:52] <donttrustem> jazzkutya: Yeah
[07:52] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: Download Monitor
[07:52] <donttrustem> Need to insert and save
[07:52] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: you can make a 2GB swap file and see how that works for you -with that much memory i dought you'll be hitting swap unless your running production databases from your system
[07:52] <blueoil22> hi
[07:52] <jazzkutya> press i for insert mode
[07:52] <jazzkutya> press esc to go out of insert mode
[07:52] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: thats how i run windows =)
[07:52] <jazzkutya> save is :w outside of insert mode
[07:53] <donttrustem> But using a UK keyboard ..
[07:53] <jazzkutya> save and quit is :wq outside of insert mode
[07:53] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: nice :), i still need a crutch though
[07:53] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: apt://download-monitor might get you there (not sure if the chat client will make it a clickable link
[07:53] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i don't think i can ditch windows that fast
[07:53] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: understandable i guess
[07:53] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: in due time, i can remove the training wheels
[07:53] <donttrustem> It says changing a read only file LOL ....how can this be when I am in root
[07:54] <x[i]b> anyone know how would i setup bind/named to run it's DNS requests through TOR?
[07:54] <SolarisBoy> donttrustem: vim says that when you have the file open elsewhere also
[07:54] <SolarisBoy> donttrustem: or if it shutdown uncleanly and left a .swp file
[07:54]  * PatrickDickey is about 98% Windows free. I still have it, and use it occasionally, but not much. And only because the computer I bought had it installed. I added my drives to the computer.
[07:54] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: 2 gig swap file, 10 gigs for a windows virtualbox <-- seems kinda small tbh
[07:54] <tasslehoff> Is ecryptfs the way to go if I want to encrypt a single folder?
[07:54] <SolarisBoy> windows and linux are 2 different beasts
[07:55] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: it is possible that the root filesystem is mounted read-only
[07:55] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, i have 16gigs of ram, by having a 2 gig swap file, does that mean i won't be using it so it can remain small?
[07:55] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: did you get the recovery shell because of an fsck error?
[07:56] <donttrustem> This is driving me crazy.  No I used the install cd and recovery mode
[07:56] <BlackDalek> Is the linux game tome site permanently down now?
[07:56] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: the relation of swap to memory needs to be rethought the 2x - 2.5x size of memory idealogy should be thrown out - with modern systems you dont need that much swap unless ofcourse some application specifically looks for that -
[07:56] <BillyZane> by the way, i appreciate all the help everyone has been giving me. i've learned a lot the last 2 few days
[07:56] <donttrustem> Selected from the grub menu
[07:56] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: 2GB is fine with 16GB of memory
[07:56] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: well i think i know what's going on
[07:56] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, can swap files be enlarged in the future?
[07:56] <donttrustem> jazzkutya: Tell me
[07:57] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: it depends on how you make them
[07:57] <BillyZane> hmm.. what does it depend on?
[07:57] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: if the swap file is on LVM yes - if not no - but you can add more swap files easily and swapon
[07:57] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: you are not editing the file you wanted to edit. you are editing the recovery system's version of the file. you have to mount your root filesystem manually, edit there then don't forget to unmount before rebooting
[07:57] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, what's an LVM?
[07:57] <jazzkutya> plase someone tell if I'm wrong
[07:58] <aeon-ltd> SolarisBoy: It's still there because a lot of people thought of linux as a migration OS when windows just wasn't cutting it anymore. back then high end was anything over 1gb of ram.
[07:58] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : i salute you ^5 ... looks to me like you've come a long way just tonight ;-)
[07:58] <PatrickDickey> jazzkutya: You're pretty close. It's because the filesystem is mounted read-only. But everything else you said is right.
[07:58] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick: thank you, i compiled and ran hello world! LOL
[07:58] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: it stands for logical volume manager - it's pretty cool if your into learning you should check it out
[07:58] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a way of managing your partitions.
[07:59] <donttrustem> jazzkutya: Do you think the lastest version has fixed this boot problem
[07:59] <dfgmme> Unable to locate package download-monitor
[07:59] <dfgmme> so sad
[07:59] <jazzkutya> PatrickDickey: he is using the install cd's recovery mode. does that mount the installed filesystem?
[07:59] <XMLnewbi> man still cant figure out how to copy and paste into vmware
[07:59] <Ben64> dfgmme: you don't need to announce how sad you are
[07:59] <BillyZane> ahh... i'll do a little background reading real fast, brb
[07:59] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: it's virtualized storage - allowing you to expand it on a physical level (adding disks to expand size) and also on the software level by expanding the FS to the extents of the logical volume live while things are running
[07:59] <dfgmme> why it is so damn hard to even install one simple app ?
[07:59] <PatrickDickey> jazzkutya: nope. I missed that part.
[07:59] <aeon-ltd> XMLnewbi: i think you need guest additions to sync clipboards
[08:00] <SolarisBoy> dfgmme: maybe because you can't describe properly what your looking for
[08:00] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : that's the first step to c and your learned knowledge for connecting to a ubuntu box remotely is impressive also :)
[08:00] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i was hearing about that the other day
[08:00] <dfgmme> it can't be installed
[08:00] <Ben64> can't be installed or can't find?
[08:00] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: are you on 12.04 or 12.10?
[08:00] <dfgmme> the app seems non existen
[08:00] <dfgmme> 11
[08:00] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick, thank you, i am a huge n00b though. but i'm learning as fast as i can. i have the drive, the patience, i just don't want to wear out the people in here, but so far, they can match me and handle 10 times more
[08:01] <BillyZane> i am very grateful for everyone's help by the way
[08:01] <Ben64> dfgmme: what does "lsb_release -r" say
[08:01] <BillyZane> i wish i could return the favor
[08:01] <BillyZane> anyone here need help with math? that's about all i'm good at
[08:01] <SolarisBoy> lol
[08:01] <Ben64> BillyZane: in a while you will be a pro
[08:02] <SolarisBoy> +1
[08:02] <SolarisBoy> i agree with an attitude like that you don't have long at all
[08:02] <BillyZane> i hope to be able to schedule programs on a batch TORQUE scheduler on my school's cluster by the end of this coming semester, at least that's the goal
[08:02] <jazzkutya> donttrustem: sorry I've only dealt with the problem of you can't save in vim in recovery mode, I don't know about your original problem
[08:03] <SolarisBoy> ahh ro fs in recovery mode mount -o remount,rw
[08:03] <BillyZane> i need to install torque!
[08:03] <SolarisBoy> im guessing there was no swp file there
[08:03] <PatrickDickey> dfgmme: It's not a part of the ubuntu repositories. Here's more information on how to install it http://www.ubuntugeek.com/download-monitor-monitors-the-amount-of-data-uploaded-and-downloaded-over-a-network.html
[08:04] <Ben64> PatrickDickey: its part of my repositories
[08:04] <dfgmme> i give up
[08:04] <evilbug> anyone know if ubuntu for android will be available for download from the site?
[08:04] <SolarisBoy> sar does exactly that and you have it installed ...
[08:04]  * SolarisBoy just saying
[08:04] <Ben64> SolarisBoy: he's gone
[08:04] <SolarisBoy> oh i block those - my bad lol
[08:04] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Man this is so inconsistent.  It has loaded ok now without me changing anything
[08:04] <PatrickDickey> evilbug: i'm guessing it's only going to be available if you're a manufacturer. But, I don't know.
[08:05] <BillyZane> brb, i'm going to read up on LVM online
[08:05] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: that's without the recovery cd in the drive?
[08:05] <evilbug> PatrickDickey: yeah, that's what i thought. unfortunate, it looks way cool and i can't wait to try it on my s2.
[08:05] <donttrustem> It has the dvd in but I just let it load normally
[08:06] <PatrickDickey> evilbug: It's not expected out until later this year. So you never know.
[08:06] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: try taking the dvd out, just to be sure.
[08:06] <evilbug> PatrickDickey: i knoooow but i can't wait! :)
[08:06] <donttrustem> I am just going to install an irc clieny on the latop so I can past what I have
[08:06] <evilbug> PatrickDickey: actually i haven't been this excited about an os since mac os 10.6 was released.
[08:06] <subcool> hey- im back.
[08:07] <subcool> k- that didnt really work
[08:07] <PatrickDickey> wb subcool.
[08:07] <jazzkutya> BillyZane: tranfer all you knowledge about the nabla operator and vector spaces telepathically to me, please :)
[08:07] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Any idea what one to install
[08:07] <PatrickDickey> subcool: what error is it showing now?
[08:07] <subcool> um.. according to gparted, i have a error with clusters. i ran chkdsk on windows... atleast i told it to.. i dont think it did
[08:07] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: I use quassel, but xchat is alright too.
[08:07] <subcool> can i do a chkdisk from ubuntu?
[08:08] <subcool> PatrickDickey, its the same error from before..
[08:08] <PatrickDickey> subcool: fsck is checkdisk for linux.
[08:08] <BillyZane> jazzkutya: i'm pretty good with vector spaces, but i kinda suck at nabla. i should have studied that more
[08:09] <BillyZane> regarding nabla, do you mean dot products, cross products, gradients?
[08:09] <PatrickDickey> evilbug: I know the feeling. Of course my phone is so old, it was obsolete before I bought it. It's running Android 2.3.5.
[08:09] <evilbug> PatrickDickey: i'm still runnign that on my s2.
[08:09] <subcool> fsck: fsck.ntfs: not found
[08:10] <subcool> PatrickDickey,
[08:10] <PatrickDickey> Which S2 do you have evilbug?
[08:10] <evilbug> PatrickDickey: gingerbread is so stable and efficient.
[08:10] <evilbug> PatrickDickey: sprint epic 4g touch.
[08:10] <PatrickDickey> Ahh ok.
[08:10] <Ben64> subcool: you should run chkdsk twice on windows
[08:10] <BlackDalek> are there any Q*bert clones for ubuntu/linux?

[08:18] <Guest3960> Ok I will give this a try
[08:20] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: Ok .... installed
[08:20] <asilhouette> hi everyone, can someone recommend me a real time wireless network signal and quality monitor app for 12.10. rutilT used to work, but now it doesn't
[08:20] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: now I need to past the config in pastebin
[08:21] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: if it's booting correctly, you probably don't. But, if you still need help with it, then yes.
[08:21] <subcool_> ``q, well that helped.. but- didnt. i ran fsk and same error
[08:22] <subcool_> imma reboot into windows again. :/
[08:22] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: http://pastebin.com/a9YeJ49G
[08:24] <subcool_> finally got an error during boot- some new softweare is preventing a chkdisk from running
[08:24] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: did you copy and paste it directly from the webpage to the /etc/default/grub?
[08:24] <subcool_> too funny
[08:25] <PatrickDickey> does it say what software subcool_?
[08:25] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, nah- only to do a system restore
[08:26] <PatrickDickey> That would be your best bet, if you haven't done it already.
[08:26] <PatrickDickey> Once you get it working, what do you want to do?
[08:26] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: NO  i typed manually
[08:27] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: try copy and paste, if you can. Just to see if that fixes the problem. I'm thinking it might be something simple like the ""'s.
[08:27] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, im tryhing to resize it so i can install win8
[08:27] <subcool_> win7 is hosed... malware- etc. so im just installing a fresh copy of win8 for my girl. but ugh. what a mess
[08:27] <subcool_> there is no restoring this mess
[08:27] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: but the strange thing is it works sometimes
[08:28] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: is it a dual-boot?
[08:28] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, not yet
[08:28] <``q> subcool_: if gparted doesn't do the trick, try some proprietary software  e.g.  partition magic  etc
[08:28] <PatrickDickey> Why do you want to keep Windows 7, if it's hosed?
[08:28] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: hello
[08:28] <``q> sometimes it outperforms the error rate of opensource filesystem apps
[08:28] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: I'm not sure what to tell you then. :S
[08:28] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, system settings and shit..
[08:28] <berderquentin> Hi, I have a question. I want an app to auto launch (XBMC) with various other (Transmission), it is working, as I have it in the Sartup Applications list. But it is not "focus". Is there any command I can add to the launch command to have it on top of everything in fullscreen.
[08:29] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: hey
[08:29] <``q> or what was it called,  disk director  (see hiren boot cd e.g. ?)
[08:29] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, i was reading up on LVM online
[08:29] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: Easy Transfer, and then reinstall Windows 7. Resize the partition at that point.
[08:29] <subcool_> easy transfer?
[08:29] <BillyZane> solarisboy: so... it's incredibly awesome, but how would i use it in practice? would it control 1 partion on a drive or the entire physical hard drive?
[08:30] <PatrickDickey> It should be an option in All PRograms Accessories somewhere. Easy Transfer Wizard, or something like that.
[08:30] <BillyZane> partition
[08:30] <PatrickDickey> Transfer the data to another drive, and then reinstall.
[08:30] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, yea- i told her to do that
[08:30] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: it can control partitions or drives it starts by marking a drive or partition as a physical volume
[08:31] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, at this point i might just do just that- Format fresh. She was prepared for it- but.. :/ you always forget something.
[08:31] <subcool_> ya knokw?
[08:31] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: So, ultimately you're going to have Windows 7 on one partition, and Windows 8 on another, right?
[08:31] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i see, so i can have my C drive as an NTFS partition, then i can great a "linux" LVM partition that would have sub partitions within that partition. these sub partitions would be / and /home , is this correct or no?
[08:31] <SolarisBoy> once thats done you add physical volumes to volume groups which are like virtual disks made from many physical disks - finally you create a logical volume on top of the volume groups - and make a filesystem on that
[08:31] <PatrickDickey> subcool_:  that's why I'm saying use the Easy Transfer wizard. It gets all of the documents and stuff.
[08:31] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: yes but in your case you wouldn't benefit any from that
[08:32] <SolarisBoy> it would be better to have multiple drives or expect to have multiple drives with lvm
[08:32] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, if i end up formatting it- it will only be win8
[08:32] <SolarisBoy> additionally you'll need a standard partition available for /boot
[08:32] <xmlnewbi> what the dir for ubuntu server to view a disk drive?
[08:32] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, im just dualbooting it so she has access to everything until she is happy
[08:33] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: I'm not sure about this, but it could be used to bring all of her stuff over to Win 8 also.
[08:33] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, but i just cant seem to get past this disk error shit.
[08:33] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: try the system restore.
[08:33] <SolarisBoy> so if your looking to dual boot just use simple partitioning but if you ever get a system running only linux you may want to play around with it BillyZane
[08:33] <subcool_> i could just "upgrade" it - but like linxu, that never works out weel
[08:33] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: I get this now when trying to update grub /usr/sbin/grub-mkconfig: 11: /etc/default/grub: splash: not found
[08:33] <donttrustem_> susan@susan-ubuntu:~$
[08:33] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: so say i have windows on C drive, i can have 2 partitions, a / and a /home partition. each of these partitions would each have LVM on them, then on top of that ext3/4 would be installed on them.
[08:33] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, nah. she doesnt have a safe restore point
[08:33] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: you wouldn't want to do that
[08:33] <subcool_> i need to somehow force a chck disk
[08:34] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, so maybe i shouldn't use LVM then?
[08:34] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: did you do the splash portion on the webpage? if so, I'd undo that.
[08:34] <subcool_> i just dont get why linux wont do it properly
[08:34] <``q> subcool_:  chkdsk /f
[08:34] <subcool_> ``q,  ya- its sets up for a reboot scan
[08:34] <subcool_> then complains about some stupid software being in the way
[08:34] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i don't mind using a simple partition
[08:34] <subcool_> it has to have a virus
[08:34] <SolarisBoy> in your case with wanting to keep another OS and mix FS types - no
[08:34] <Tex_Nick> subcool_ ; KINDA TRY TO KEEP YOUR LANGUAGE FAMILY FRIENDLY ;-)
[08:35] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: I'd just do a straight partitioning. Keep it simple, I always say. ;)
[08:35] <Tex_Nick> SORRY FOR CAPS :(
[08:35] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: what spalsh portion?
[08:35] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: in your case just resize the C drive and allow ubuntu to install on the new space all on one new partition
[08:35] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: do you have a Windows 7 installation disk?
[08:35] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: I am running 12.04
[08:35] <Spudage> hi all, I'm looking for a couple of quick pointers. I've installed Ubuntu 12.10 server and have found that my static IP configuration in /etc/network/interfaces works fine for some time (e.g., hours) and then at some point in time Ubuntu decides to switch back to DHCP
[08:35] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, no
[08:35] <dr_willis> an easy wizard... as opposed to a difficult wizard. ;)
[08:36] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: ok, so lets say i don't do it that way. i'll create 2 additional partitions, / and /home , each being either ext3/4. i should keep swap on the / drive right? if i were to run a virtualbox, would it install on the / drive? if so, windows 7 is somewhat large, i would think i should install a lot of space for this drive
[08:36] <Spudage> my /etc/network/interfaces file is still as i configured it. restarting network services makes it work with my static again. Any ideas?
[08:36] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: you should have one partition for linux when you resize
[08:36] <Spudage> done lots of searching and found plenty of ppl with the same problem but no real fixes
[08:36] <SolarisBoy> linux can run from one partition fine - it would just put everything under "/" (root)
[08:36] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: Reboot it, and start hitting F8 until you get a menu. Try safe mode Or startup repair, if that's an option. Then you might be able to checkdisk it.
[08:37] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: can you paste your new grub config please?
[08:38] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, good idea
[08:38] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i don't mind doing that, but i've heard that if you want to reinstall ubuntu on a clean drive, it makes it difficult. having 2 is something i usually do with windows, so it seems logical to me to have 2 partitions for linux
[08:38] <BillyZane> by the way, i just added 100gigs to C drive! yay!
[08:38] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: if you need it and have the space sure
[08:38] <dr_willis> reinstall to a clean drive?  if the drive is clean its a new install? :)  I normally have a / and /home and swap parttuons on my installs
[08:38] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, i got an empty 1 tb hard drive, space i have, headaches i can do without
[08:39] <dr_willis> using a whole 2nd drive on a system just for linux can save a lot of headaches
[08:39] <SolarisBoy> right a seperate /home allows you to choose to use that existing partition as /home when running a new instance of the installer
[08:39] <SolarisBoy> dr_willis: yeps =)
[08:39] <BillyZane> dr_willis: someday, i will
[08:40] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: http://pastebin.com/HRwxUegS
[08:40] <BillyZane> i'm too new at this to ditch windows completely, but i might be able to delete C drive one day and go completely linux
[08:40] <subcool_> i hate windows
[08:40] <dr_willis> drives ae deccently cheap these days. ;) just swap out your C:  with a nice SSD and keep it on a shelf in case you ever need it.
[08:40] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: it is the " that is wrong
[08:41] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: how much should i give to / and /home ? - considering i will keep 2gb swap in / and possibly run a virtual machine for windows 7
[08:41] <subcool_> im in sysmter repair with cmd. and now the f' drive is write protected.
[08:41] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  ive filled up 10gb of / befor.. so i go for at least 30gb for / these days. ;) rest for home and swap
[08:41] <BillyZane> dr_willis, i'd like to do that, but i'm an undergraduate student, lol
[08:42] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: like i said it depends on your usage of the system my storage server runs ubuntu and the root partition is about 60GB - and i've installed ubuntu on smaller partitions - but again - if you plan on installing things take care to make it large enough
[08:42] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: changed then and it is working now
[08:42] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem_: go into the /etc/default/grub, and change the "'s. Just delete the ones that are there, and put them back in.
[08:42] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem_: :D You're quicker than I am. LOL
[08:42] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, i plan on installing things. like.. i want to test out stuff
[08:42] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem_: and it reboots normally over and over?
[08:42] <SolarisBoy> then it really depends on what you want to test
[08:43] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  installing stuff takes amazing little spacve comapred to windows. ;)
[08:43] <SolarisBoy> just treat it like you would windows on that front
[08:43] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: dunno yet
[08:43] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, i want to run apps for molecular dynamics which take up a huge amount of ram if you run a lot of atoms
[08:43] <SolarisBoy> true but stuff adds up - dont try to do a super tiny root drive and then run out of space..
[08:44] <BillyZane> i'm considering the possibility that i might get 32gb of ram and might need a 64gb swap file some day
[08:44] <SolarisBoy> you dont..
[08:44] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: OK trying again
[08:44] <SolarisBoy> as stated 2GB will be fine for you
[08:44] <BillyZane> where does the swap file reside?
[08:44] <dr_willis> really have to wonder at an app that uses 90+gb of ram and swap
[08:44] <dr_willis> swap is a partion
[08:44] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: wherever you want it
[08:44] <SolarisBoy> swap can be a file or partition
[08:45] <BillyZane> i'd like it as a file
[08:45] <dr_willis> of the type swap. Or it can be a file.. OR it can be combonations of files and partitions
[08:45] <BillyZane> nice
[08:45] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  why
[08:45] <BillyZane> can i keep it on / ?
[08:45] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: How big of a partition are you working with overall?
[08:45] <dr_willis> its best to have swap on a partition
[08:45] <ist162548> join #android
[08:45] <SolarisBoy> indeed
[08:45] <PatrickDickey> ist162548: you forgot the / ;)
[08:45] <dr_willis> if you want to use the hibernate then i belive swap MUST be on a partition
[08:46] <BillyZane> dr_willis: i'm asking these questions because very soon i intend on installing ubuntu for the first time. i a 3 day old penguine, i know nothing outside of the ls command that i didn't learn in the last few days, i want to be absolutely certain about what to do before i start this, it's scary but i'll give it a go
[08:46] <BillyZane> what is the hibernate?
[08:46] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Nope same friggin problem
[08:46] <dr_willis> stick to the defaults..
[08:46] <PatrickDickey> suspend to disk (hibernate on windows)
[08:46] <dr_willis> ;) then you can change things later
[08:46] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey: i have about 250gb on C drive, and the rest of the 1tb hard drive is unallocated
[08:46] <SolarisBoy> persisting memory to hard drive so you can wake up where you left off BillyZane
[08:46] <subcool_> there has to be some linux disk checker that will work
[08:47] <subcool_> maybe fsck is just not setup right.
[08:47] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, i can give these drives as much space as they need, but i would like to keep things less than what is necessary
[08:47] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: If you were just going to create one giant partition, how big would you make it?
[08:47] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : segregating home is really a good thing to do for backup & fresh installs ... fro performance you might also think about shoving your web cache in tempfs for speed :-). Its good for SSDs too, fewer writes with worthless data
[08:47] <SolarisBoy> Tex_Nick: +1
[08:47] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, i could give it as much as it needs, i could probably go with 300 without feeling too bad
[08:47] <dr_willis> I got my / on a 128gb ssd, then a bigger hd for home
[08:48] <SolarisBoy> same
[08:48] <SolarisBoy> and on my storage box i have 2 bigger drives in a lvm shared out the network
[08:48] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick: precisely why i want to segregate / , i think it's awesome. but the question is, how big do i make home? consider that i would like to maybe get a large swap file on this drive (no swap partition), and i would likely run a windows 7 virtual box... hmm.. perhaps that coul be on /home if possible
[08:49] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  why do you think its better to do a swap file if you have never used linux befor?
[08:49] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Wtf now it doesn't even boot.  Man I thought ubuntu was supposed to be the best ever:(
[08:49] <BillyZane> dr_willis: that is an epic setup
[08:49] <SolarisBoy> the vbox can by of dynamic disk type so doesn't neccesarily need to take up that much disk space
[08:49] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Since you've got free space, I'd say something like 50GB for /, 300 GB for /home. You can always resize them if you need more.  Well, with the /, it'll be a reformat and reinstallation.
[08:49] <SolarisBoy> *be
[08:49] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  whats epic setup?  A fairly standard setup would be abouit 20-30gb for / a few gb for swap, and rest for home
[08:50]  * PatrickDickey is just throwing numbers out as an example.
[08:50] <BillyZane> dr_willis: because people tell me i don't need a swap file, and my guess is that the only advantage is that there's always physical space avaiable for the swap file to expand if it's needed
[08:50] <dr_willis> by default the installer wont let you use a swap file
[08:50] <BillyZane> err.. sorry
[08:50] <BillyZane> that i don't need a swap partition
[08:51] <dr_willis> I dont have a swap parition on my 8gb setup. because i frogot to add one. ;)
[08:51] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: did you edit the /etc/default/grub and remove everything but quiet splash, and then reboot? Or did it work before, so you never tried that?
[08:51] <SolarisBoy> you would just choose no swap on the installer - and then add the swap file later if thats what you really wanted
[08:51] <dr_willis> and when i moved my home . i deleted it. ;)
[08:51] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey: that sounds reasonable
[08:51] <dr_willis> I could have had the system allready installed in the time its been taking you to worry about a trivial 2gb of swap  on a partition. ;;)
[08:52] <SolarisBoy> also true
[08:52] <dr_willis> one nice thing about a swap partion. is that many live cds' will see and use it.. if its there
[08:52] <BillyZane> i have a related question to ask that might solve this problem... this question is stemmed from my lack of understanding. what is installed on / and what is installed on /home ? is / just the kernel? is /home the applications?
[08:52] <dr_willis>  / is the root of the whole filesystem... /home is all the users home directories
[08:52] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: It works if I go into recovery mode and run update grub then resume reboot normally
[08:52] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : 1.1 X RAM is usually a good factor fot swap
[08:52] <dr_willis>  /home is mounted into the home direccory on /
[08:53] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick: i will go with that then.
[08:53] <dr_willis> thats why its /home  ;)  thats the full path to it
[08:53] <SolarisBoy> hmm
[08:53] <SolarisBoy> how much memory do you have?
[08:53] <BillyZane> according to dr_willis however, the installer does not give me the option to not have a swap partition, how can i not have one then?
[08:53] <BillyZane> i have 16gb
[08:54] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : that would give you a safe margin if you want to suspend/hibernate system
[08:54] <SolarisBoy> you just choose no swap it asks if your sure you say yea
[08:54] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: I'm at a loss. If it updates in the recovery, then it should boot normally after that.
[08:54] <SolarisBoy> you really don't need a 16GBish swap file...
[08:54] <SolarisBoy> waste of hdd space
[08:54] <SolarisBoy> unless your computer is from like 95
[08:54] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick, what does that mean? you mean like sleep mode? why would it not be safe if you didn't have one? is it saving all the ram to the swap file when going in to hybernation mode so it can be reloaded?
[08:54] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: when you're at the disk partitioning stage, choose the option to "Do Something else".
[08:55] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey: is that an actual option?
[08:55] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: is it a waste if i go beyond 16gb of ram for some reason
[08:55] <dr_willis> it does not thve the option to make a swap FILE
[08:55] <PatrickDickey> Yes. You should have a screen that says something like "Ubuntu detected another operating system..." And it should be the bottom option.
[08:56] <dr_willis> it will want to make a swap partiion
[08:56] <SolarisBoy> to me it is - but im not taking hibernation into consideration
[08:56] <subcool_> why wont fsck scan the drive properly? i dont get it. it even sasys it has a cluster error.
[08:56] <SolarisBoy> lol i dont even use swap
[08:56] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: do you have gparted open by chance?
[08:56] <Flynsarmy> how do i get out of gnome shell lock screen without a mouse? i see an arrow flashing upwards every now and then but no keyboard combo seems to do anything
[08:56] <subcool_> not yet
[08:56] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, not yet
[08:56] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: are you planning on using hibernation? If I remember right, it's not enabled by default in Ubuntu.
[08:56] <subcool_> im booting into linux now
[08:56] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy: i'm not sure what hybernation is, so i can't say if i would need it
[08:57] <PatrickDickey> subcool_: Open Gparted, and click on the drive. Then do the test on it. Let it run (the SMART test).
[08:57] <BillyZane> is hybernation the storing of ram in to the hard disk for later reloading?
[08:57] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: its when the computer is using minimal power and things in memory are persisted to disk to be recovered when you wake the computer up
[08:57] <BillyZane> if so, it makes sense that it would need a 1:1 allocation
[08:57] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, k
[08:57] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Ok ... I just ran update grub from recovery mode and resumed reboot.  I get half the screen in colour  and the rest is black.  I then reboot normally and get a  complete  black screen
[08:58] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PowerManagement/Hibernate
[08:58] <BillyZane> ty for the link
[08:58] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : sorry i didn't know you had taht much RAM ... SolarisBoy is right ... you don't need that much swap then ... when a system hibernates though ... any active process' are stored to swap for restart
[08:58] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsVideoCardsPoulsbo this might help you too.
[08:59] <auronandace> !nomodeset | donttrustem
[08:59] <ubottu> donttrustem: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[09:00] <BillyZane> ok, we have a non anomalous result here. the swap file will be left at 2 gb. can i increase this at a later time?
[09:00] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: sure
[09:00] <BillyZane> ok
[09:00] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: you can remove the swap file and add a new one - or add more and swapon them to enable them
[09:00] <BillyZane> and will this reside in / or /home
[09:00] <SolarisBoy> either or -
[09:00] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: doesn't matter - don't put them someplace that will get wiped i'd say..
[09:00] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Technically, it will reside in it's own space.
[09:00] <Tex_Nick> SolarisBoy : ^5
[09:01] <BillyZane> if i run a virtual box for windows 7, and allocate say 20gb to this, would it reside on / or /home ?
[09:01] <BillyZane> what resides in /
[09:01] <BillyZane> is it just the kernel?
[09:01] <BillyZane> i'd like to keep it to the kernal and swap
[09:01] <SolarisBoy> the system/programs etc
[09:01] <BillyZane> so what goes in /home ?
[09:01] <SolarisBoy> Tex_Nick: =)
[09:01] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Think of it like this: Take a pie and cut it into three pieces. They're all part of the same pie, but each is separate, right?
[09:01] <BillyZane> is home the stuff like files and media, pictures, etc
[09:02] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, i follow
[09:02] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: technically no
[09:02] <bekks> BillyZane: home holds user settings, etc.
[09:02] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: /home is location for users folders and under the user folder is location for media and etc
[09:02] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: so you music is like /home/user/Music - etc.
[09:02] <BillyZane> i see
=== Albastos|off is now known as Albastos
[09:02] <BillyZane> big question, if i have an NTFS partition
[09:03] <bekks> You cant use it for /home
[09:03] <BillyZane> say, D drive, separate from / and /home, can i access the media on that drive
[09:03] <bekks> Yes.
[09:03] <SolarisBoy> sure
[09:03] <PatrickDickey> Ok, that's essentially what you're doing with the partitioning. You're cutting the drive into three pieces. When you ask about /, it's the filesystem. But, if you look at it using ls or a file manager, you'll see /home also. It's a link to the partition that has /home on it.
[09:04] <BillyZane> ok
[09:04] <PatrickDickey> You won't see /swap, but it's linked off of / also.
[09:04] <SolarisBoy> if it's a partition
[09:04] <BillyZane> by the way, i really appreciate everyone's help
[09:04] <PatrickDickey> In other words, when you look at the "pie" you'll see one giant piece. But, in reality, it's cut up into three.
[09:04] <PatrickDickey> ^ SolarisBoy. (What he said is right).
[09:05] <BillyZane> this is what i gather from what everyone is saying, due to the fact that all the programs and kernel and swap is stored on / , i should allocate the most space for / , because i plan on keeping most of my media outside on an NTFS drive, i should probably not give /home as much space , would this be a wise decision?
[09:05] <SolarisBoy> but in general right on - like cutting up a pie
[09:05] <BillyZane> i'm considering about 60 gb for / and about 20 gb for /home , is that ok?
[09:05] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: heh - seems like your selling home short
[09:05] <dr_willis> i must have 10+gb of wallpaper in my /home/username   ;)
[09:06] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: I'd go the other way around. Unless you don't plan on storing any documents on the drive.
[09:06] <SolarisBoy> think of it like this - by default - your virtual machines will be in your home folder..
[09:06] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, it says deamn is inhibited
[09:06] <SolarisBoy> if your using VirtualBox or VMware
[09:06] <bekks> In vbox, you can easily change the path where vms will be stored.
[09:06] <SolarisBoy> so if you make a 10GB VM then you easily killed half your space
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest50125
[09:06] <SolarisBoy> sure bekks but just saying =)
[09:06] <SolarisBoy> 20GB seems small for home
[09:06] <BillyZane> SolarisBoy, i don't mind increasing /home, but i feel like nothing will be stored on it of any really critical value, i understand though that /user/ will be on it, thus a lot of files will be there, such as installation files and tar files and such, so i should give it an adequate space, which you have just convinced me to do
[09:07] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  /user/ ? theres no /user/  ;)  theres /home/YOURUSERNAMES
[09:07] <bekks> My /home's are never bigger than 4GB.
[09:07] <BillyZane> lol
[09:07] <SolarisBoy> you could also make .VirtualBox a soft link from another drive
[09:07] <skp1_> does anyone know how to add a .desktop file to the launcher from the command line?
[09:07] <SolarisBoy> but meh
[09:07] <dr_willis> i got my /home on its own 3TB HD.
[09:07] <BillyZane> dr_willis: is what i meant ;)
[09:07] <bekks> Everything else like vms, files, etc. are not userrelated and thus not stored in /home - but in /data
[09:07] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: if you're going to use a 300GB drive, I'd go 60 for / and the rest for /home (minus a swap, if you want one).
[09:07] <BillyZane> dr_willis, that's because you're a baller
[09:08] <rino> ciao
[09:08] <SolarisBoy> =( mine is like 1TB my storage has like 1.7TB together in an LVM but they both have seperate 128GB ssd's for /
[09:08] <rino> !list
[09:08] <ubottu> rino: No warez here! This is not a file sharing channel (or network); read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».
[09:08] <dr_willis> rino:  do you list every channel you join? o
[09:08] <SolarisBoy> gotta 3tb usb though ;>
[09:09] <Tex_Nick> for me, 20gb / ext4. 1.1xRAM for swap ( I assume 2gb RAM or greater) and the rest s ext4 for /home
[09:09] <dr_willis> a ssd for / is a good investment
[09:09] <SolarisBoy> not really sure why.. but it feels good to have a lot of space
[09:09] <bekks> SolarisBoy: Thats why I have several TB for /data :P
[09:09] <BillyZane> dr_willis: sigh, one day. one day. i work at a shoe store
[09:09] <SolarisBoy> bekks: ;> i love /data mounts - always interesting
[09:09] <dr_willis>  /media/vacationvideos
[09:10] <BillyZane> ummm
[09:10] <SolarisBoy> /media/virtual /media/media /media/utility -> expandable iscsi mounts ;> wootwoot
[09:10] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, nvm- it was because ih ad gparted running
[09:10] <SolarisBoy> /media/media/ confuses me sometimes though
[09:11] <dr_willis>   /media/aidem
[09:11] <bekks> SolarisBoy: /data is a shared ZFS :P
[09:11] <BillyZane> thank you solarcloud_3scrn, Tex_Nick, dr_willis, PatrickDickey, bekks
[09:11] <SolarisBoy> bekks: =0
[09:11] <BillyZane> err SolarisBoy
[09:11] <SolarisBoy> bekks: noice ;>
[09:11] <BillyZane> lol, he gave me a little help earlier
[09:12] <Tex_Nick> lol ... BillyZane, dr_willis has a good point about ssd's ... linus torvalds recently compared hard drives to satan ;-)
[09:12] <BillyZane> really?
[09:12] <BillyZane> is it because they crash?
[09:12] <PatrickDickey> No problem BillyZane.
[09:12] <BillyZane> ohh.. i've heard that ext4 is not compatible with windows
[09:12] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : yes
[09:12] <SolarisBoy> its not
[09:13] <bekks> BillyZane: Thats true.
[09:13] <BillyZane> by incompatible, does that mean i would not be able to access media on an ntfs drive?
[09:13] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: no linux partition is.  Well, there's an application ext2dos or something like that, but I wouldn't trust it.
[09:13] <bekks> BillyZane: No. ext4 cannot be mounted from windows.
[09:13] <BillyZane> or does it mean that windows can not access ext4
[09:13] <SolarisBoy> correct - or better put can't access that data from a windows installation using it's native utilities
[09:13] <bekks> BillyZane: Linux coun mount NTFS.
[09:13] <SolarisBoy> bekks: the latter
[09:13] <bekks> *can
[09:13] <auronandace> BillyZane: it means if you are using windows you won't access ext4 partitions
[09:13] <SolarisBoy> woops *BillyZane - not bekks
[09:14] <BillyZane> hmm
[09:14] <subcool_> Hey, im getting tired. gnite all
[09:14] <dr_willis> !ntfs
[09:14] <ubottu> To view your Windows/Mac partitions see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticallyMountPartitions - For write access, see !NTFS-3g or !FUSE
[09:14] <subcool_> PatrickDickey, ``q  and everyone else.. thanks for the help.
[09:14] <BillyZane> so.. in practice, i could be in linux and i would have a mounted NTFS drive that i could browse, but in windows, i would not be able to browse linux partitions
[09:14] <PatrickDickey> no problem subcool_.
[09:14] <bekks> BillyZane: Correct.
[09:14] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Right.
[09:15] <BillyZane> if i use ext3, is that problem resolved for accessing linux drives on windows?
[09:15] <dr_willis> windows is limited
[09:15] <SolarisBoy> nope
[09:15] <SolarisBoy> windows is non tolerant to open source
[09:15] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: If you know that you're going to need to access files from both, then create a partition that's formatted ntfs and copy the files there.
[09:15] <BillyZane> i suppose it won't really matter going backwards
[09:15] <jorick> hey can i have my photos  "protected" when they import so that i don't accidentally lose them when i drag them to my dropbox? like put mode ticky on the directory or something?
[09:15] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, good idea
[09:15] <bekks> jorick: Create a backup then.
[09:15] <dr_willis> dont trust windows tools that access ext# filesystems
[09:15] <BillyZane> so, worse case scenario, i copy files to NTFS from linux
[09:15] <SolarisBoy> microsoft would keel over and convulse if they had to put some open source FS drivers in their OS stack
[09:15] <SolarisBoy> meh
[09:16] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: You won't make it your /home or anything like that though. it'll be a separate partition altogether.
[09:16] <BillyZane> lol
[09:16] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey: what do you mean?
[09:16] <kepler> i just use a nas that i mount as nfs on linux, and have shared with cifs for windows
[09:16] <jorick> bekks, i use dropbox as an online backup for my most precious pictures
[09:16] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey: can't i just transfer a file, say homework.c to a C drive while i'm in linux?
[09:16] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: yes
[09:16] <PatrickDickey> I mean, all of your linux partitions (/, /home) will be formatted as ext4. You'll need one more partition if you want to copy between windows and linux.
[09:17] <bekks> jorick: Then your question is pointless :)
[09:17] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Yes, you can do that. I wasn't sure how much data you'd want to share.
[09:17] <bekks> jorick: Either you rely on your backup, or you dont rely on it and you create a local backup.
[09:17] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey: hmm.... i probably won't share anything too large
[09:17] <BillyZane> thank you everyone once again
[09:18] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: If you find that you need the space, you can always create another partition in whatever you have unallocated.
[09:18] <SolarisBoy> i saw this shirt with a usb stick on it that said "back that thing up"
[09:18] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : on dual boot ( windoze & linux ) i always disable windows file indexing ... it's crashed ubuntu files in the distant past
[09:18] <BillyZane> when i install ubuntu... i'm presuming i'll have to select windows or ubuntu when the system starts, is that boot up feature come default after an instillation, or should be be aware of any sort of boot up software i should install
[09:18] <jorick> bekks: ok got it, there's no way for linux to say: "don't allow modifications on files created in this dir, but allow new files anyways". sorry for asking
[09:19] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick: that crashing is not a problem now though?
[09:19] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: You'll get a GRUB menu that gives you the options of Ubuntu, Advanced Settings for Ubuntu, or Windows.
[09:19] <PatrickDickey> It's default, if you install any linux distribution AFTER you install Windows.

[09:19] <ubottu> The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[09:19] <bekks> jorick: Thats something different than what you asked, I guess. And yes, you could set that up using ACL.
[09:19] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, to get this grub window, i'll have to do something during the boot sequence in my bios to make this work?
[09:20] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : install windoze first then ubuntu for ease :)
[09:20] <BillyZane> i have windows installed first :D
[09:20] <SolarisBoy> it will be easy then BillyZane
[09:20] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Nope. If you install Ubuntu after Windows, Ubuntu handles that for you. If you install Windows after Ubuntu, you have to fix it.
[09:20] <BillyZane> sweet
[09:20] <BillyZane> nice
[09:20] <BillyZane> i <3 u guys
[09:21] <BillyZane> ohhh..
[09:21]  * PatrickDickey is glad to see the Ubuntu Manual is an option in the bot...  Since I've helped as an author on it. :)
[09:21] <SolarisBoy> ;)
[09:21] <jorick> bekks, ok i'll check that out. any ubuntu specific terms i could include in my search?
[09:21] <BillyZane> is the manual on the topic? i really need to see this manual
[09:21] <SolarisBoy> PatrickDickey: thats cool
[09:21] <BillyZane> the problem is, the manual is very confusing for me
[09:21] <PatrickDickey> !manual BillyZane
[09:22] <BillyZane> should i receieve a download?
[09:22]  * PatrickDickey um ok.. That didn't work the way it's supposed to.
[09:22] <jorick> whoops nvmd got it this is excactly what i needed
[09:22] <jorick> thx
[09:22] <SolarisBoy> nah its online im sure you can DL as an option somewhere

[09:22] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[09:22] <BillyZane> you are all too kind
[09:22] <BillyZane> i'm checking it out right now

[09:23]  * PatrickDickey needs to eat something and do laundry...
[09:23] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick, cool
[09:23] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, eat well
[09:23] <BillyZane> i have a question....
[09:23] <Spudage> can anyone offer some suggestions as to why my /etc/network/interfaces static IP works fine for a number of hours and then suddenly Ubuntu switches back to DHCP? (12.10 Server)
[09:23] <BillyZane> will this manual help me do an installation step by step?
[09:24] <SolarisBoy> Spudage: your probably running the dhclient
[09:24] <BillyZane> say i'm a complete novice, will it show me exactly what to install?
[09:24] <BillyZane> say i install ubuntu... after that, i have to get KDE installed (my preferred GUI)
[09:24] <BillyZane> someone was guiding me through this installation
[09:24] <Spudage> SolarisBoy, whats the easiest way to check? is it installed by default? And I'm assuming if it is it must take priority over a static setting
[09:24] <auronandace> !kubuntu | BillyZane
[09:24] <ubottu> BillyZane: Kubuntu is the Ubuntu flavour using KDE Software and the KDE Plasma Workspaces.  See http://kubuntu.org for more information - For support join  #kubuntu - See also !kde
[09:25] <SolarisBoy> BillyZane: it should walk you through more general things - so you dont have to worry about those details and it will help you find info quickly
[09:25] <BillyZane> for the virtualbox, and honestly... i can't remember all the commands i had to write
[09:25] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : this might seem lame ... but YouTube has great vids on all things linux, bash, c & c++, ubuntu ... etc :)
[09:25] <BillyZane> Tex_Nick, no it's not lame at all
[09:25] <SolarisBoy> Spudage: you can check the process table "ps auxwww|grep dhc" or maybe look for NetworkManager or networkmanager whatever they call it these days - although networkmanager generally ignores anything in /etc/network/interfaces so i would suspect dhclient -
[09:26] <Spudage> thanks mate, i'll check it out
[09:26] <SolarisBoy> Spudage: another clue may be looking at the /etc/resolv.conf file at the type it generally leaves a note if dhcp wrote things to networking config
[09:26] <BillyZane> i'm currently reading the manual for installation
[09:26] <SolarisBoy> Spudage: sure =)
[09:26] <SolarisBoy> s/type/top/
[09:27] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: I think I will go back to windows :( I am not getting anywhere with this
[09:27] <Spudage> SolarisBoy, I'll check that out too. Thanks
[09:27] <SolarisBoy> np
[09:27] <BillyZane> donttrustem: defeatist!
[09:28] <BillyZane> lol
[09:28] <SolarisBoy> if it is there and your sure your sticking with static its safe to remove the package - you can reinstall it if needed later - that will stop it from starting up and being around if not needed
[09:28] <donttrustem> BillyZane: Hey man I have been working on this for 10 hours now
[09:29] <BillyZane> donttrustem, what are you trying to do?
[09:29] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: did you try putting nomodset into the command line?
[09:29] <PatrickDickey> He's trying to get Ubuntu working on an Aspire EEPC (if I understand right).
[09:30] <JesusAlos_> Hi. I've aproblem execution program
[09:30] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Trying now
[09:30] <JesusAlos_> 	in ubuntu 10.04
[09:30] <JesusAlos_> when execute in command console: heekscnc
[09:30] <JesusAlos_> appears: error while loading shared libraries: libTKernel-6.3.0.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[09:31] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : have a look at this :)
[09:31] <SolarisBoy> JesusAlos_: the application your trying to run is looking for a library it can't find - you can try looking for the package that provides that library file and rerunning the application again
[09:31] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Same problem but I am doing this using the e command because I cannot get to the desktop
[09:32] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : jeeze forgot link http://ubuntuxtreme.com/howto/how-to-change-desktop-environment-in-ubuntu-12-10/
[09:32] <petergk> hey all
[09:33] <petergk> I just discovered the zeitgest system in ubuntu
[09:33] <petergk> scary stuff
[09:33] <JesusAlos_> solarisBoy: how do it?
[09:33] <SolarisBoy> JesusAlos_: atleast in 12.04 the packages which provide that file are libopencascade-foundation-6.5.0 but that provides the 6.5.0 libs as you see - so you probably want to look for something like that as a start
[09:34] <SolarisBoy> JesusAlos_: i used apt-file search libTKernel on my system - you can install apt-file if it's available for 10.04 and search for files in external packages like that easily
[09:34] <petergk> how is connected the zeitgeist system to the gps data sender?
[09:34] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: remove everything after the console=tty1 in the command line (everything you added after that)
[09:35] <PatrickDickey> It should look like quiet splash console=tty1 or "quiet splash console=tty1" when you hit e.
[09:35] <skp1> does anyone know how i can set ubuntu to show all messages during boot, instead of the plymouth splash screen?
[09:35] <bazhang> !nox | skp1
[09:35] <ubottu> skp1: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode
[09:36]  * PatrickDickey is actually thinking donttrustem should try 12.10 instead of 12.04.
[09:36] <donttrustem> Ok. Will download it
[09:39] <PatrickDickey> I'm going on the idea that they probably fixed the issues in 12.10, since the wiki page about the graphics card says that no workarounds are needed.
[09:39] <Ben64> whats the issue?
[09:40] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Ok coming down now .... I hope it works.  I really want to put all the machine here on ubuntu
[09:40] <PatrickDickey> He installed Ubuntu 12.04 on an AspireOne, and when he boots, it gives him a black screen. Everything he's tried from the wiki page has failed.
[09:41] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: when you boot to it, do the "Try Ubuntu" option first. Just to make sure it works.
[09:41] <donttrustem> Ok
[09:41] <PatrickDickey> And you don't want to upgrade. You want a clean installation (wipe everything and install).
[09:41] <donttrustem> I understand
[09:41] <PatrickDickey> I'm going off of what the wiki page for the graphics card suggests, just to be clear.
[09:44] <Tex_Nick> quantal ... anyone know how i can get my desktop icons to automatically align vertically ... "keep aligned" works great horizontally but not vertically
[09:45] <petergk> hello
[09:45] <donttrustem> Patrick lol ....just removed everything and it has worked ...wtf
[09:46] <dr_willis> ive rarely had issues with  my 2 netbooks ;)
[09:46] <lcabreza1> hi, how do i do an ldap search using terminal ?
[09:46] <Spudage> SolarisBoy, i did some hunting around. i don't have network manager on here. dhclient is running and i can see in /var/lib.dhcp/dhclient.eth0.leases the address that is being assigned. I would have thought that my static settings should just take priority over this lease by default
[09:47] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: try rebooting a few times. if it works, then don't change anything.
[09:47] <bekks> Spudage: Look at ifconfig -ainstead.
[09:47] <bekks> Spudage: Look at ifconfig -a instead.
[09:47] <PatrickDickey> petergk: hello
[09:47] <Spudage> i wouldn't have to kill (and remove from startup) the dhclient process would i? because then if i ever did remove the static IP i'd have to reenable it
[09:47] <Spudage> k
[09:47] <skp1> dr_willis: i was in here a minute ago asking how to see boot messages when i start my computer, appending text to the kernel line just gave me a command prompt instead of lightdm, i did not see any messages while it was booting
[09:48] <dr_willis> skp1:  try 'noquiet nosplash verbose'
[09:48] <skp1> ok thank you
[09:48] <Spudage> bekks, its still showing the correct IP since I restarted 'networking'. My problem is that after a number of hours it automatically starts using a DHCP lease again (even though my manual settings still exist in /etc/network/interfaces)
[09:48] <dr_willis> skp1:  text will keep lightdm from starting..  it boots to the text console
[09:49] <dr_willis> verbose will show a LOt of messages
[09:49] <Spudage> my concern is that dhclient will take priority again at some point
[09:50] <petergk> in ubuntu the zeitgeist system is connected to the gps system
[09:50] <petergk> :/
[09:51] <petergk> still scary
[09:51] <PatrickDickey> Why's it scary?
[09:52] <CyberInjectOr> o.O
[09:52]  * dr_willis wonders what gps system he has on his pc.
[09:53] <petergk> PatrickDickey, I can't see the direction of communication, so I need to audit
[09:53] <xiaoy> 
[09:53] <PatrickDickey> me wonders if that's why he keeps getting the message "in 100 feet make the first legal u-turn"
[09:53] <PatrickDickey> darn / anyhow. :P
[09:54]  * PatrickDickey wonders if that's why he keeps getting the message "in 100 feet make the first legal u-turn"
[09:54] <xiaoy> 
[09:54] <petergk> PatrickDickey, it's can be a good feature, but with an app which sends back data to somewhere
[09:54] <xiaoy> 
[09:55] <PatrickDickey> It's only accurate though, if your computer actually has a GPS capability.
[09:55]  * dr_willis hears  "The nearest donut shop is 400 ft ahead"
[09:55] <xiaoy> 
[09:57] <BillyZane> hmm
[09:57] <BillyZane> i got a situation
[09:57] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Strange it did not work ... So I used the e command again and remove the $vt_handoff form the  end of the line and it worked.   The problem I have is finding where to remove  it  permanently
[09:57] <xiaoy> 
[09:57] <PatrickDickey> What's up BillyZane?
=== ryanclancy000 is now known as Guest69144
[09:57] <BillyZane> i want to install ubuntu, but i feel like i will need assistance during installation
[09:57] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: can you paste your grub config again?
[09:58] <donttrustem> Yep
[09:58] <petergk> if one app sends back my activity, I am not happy
[09:58] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Are you on the computer that you're going to install it on?
[09:58] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, yes
[09:58] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, i have a second computer, 1 monitor, 1 kb/m , no KVM switch
[09:58] <BillyZane> i suppose i could unplug and replug stuff during install
[09:58] <BillyZane> the question is, how can i get help and still be lazy
[09:59] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Are you on Ubuntu right now? Live CD?
[09:59] <BillyZane> windows 7
[09:59] <BillyZane> i have ubuntu on a virtual machine that has convinced me i need MOAR
[09:59] <PatrickDickey> Boot to the Live CD, and choose the Option Try Ubuntu.
[09:59] <PatrickDickey> Then come back in here, and we'll walk you through it if you need us to.
[09:59] <BillyZane> i can install it while i'm on here?
[10:00] <BillyZane> that is really cool...
[10:00] <BillyZane> i guess i should burn a live CD then
[10:00] <PatrickDickey> I believe so. It's an application that will be running, and at some point, you can navigate the web. So I'd guess that you can.
[10:01] <[DeVil-BoY]> greets
[10:01] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: are you still looking at the Ubuntu manual?
[10:01] <BillyZane> i'll download the live CD now patrick
[10:01] <PatrickDickey> ok.
[10:02] <Spudage> SolarisBoy, FYI incase you are curious: after a bit more reading it seems that after editing my /etc/network/interfaces file and restarting networking that i should have manually killed the dhclient process (as this doesn't seem to happen automatically when disabling DHCP). now that i've killed the process it hasn't come back after a restart (so should be all good now)
[10:02] <Spudage> not sure if its a bug that dhclient stays running once the only interface on the machine has been made static though!
[10:03] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey, it says the 32bit is the recommended download, i have a 64bit chip. why is 32bit recommended? is it to ensure backward compatibility on all devices?
[10:03] <BillyZane> does the 64bit have any disadvantage?
[10:03] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  you got it..
[10:03] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: They don't know which you have. So you can choose the 64 bit.
[10:03] <dr_willis> if you got 64bit hardware. use 64bit
[10:03] <[DeVil-BoY]> i'm using 64
[10:03] <[DeVil-BoY]> so far so good
[10:03] <BillyZane> cool
[10:04] <BillyZane> ty, i'm downloading now
[10:04] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: Did you download the Ubuntu Manual earlier?
[10:04] <BillyZane> i should contribute
[10:05] <BillyZane> patrick, yes, i was reading the installation portion
[10:05] <PatrickDickey> On Page 13, is the screen that we were talking about earlier, where you choose "Something else" and then manually set up your paritions.
[10:05]  * BillyZane looks for that page
[10:06] <dr_willis> They really really need to use a better term then 'Somthing else'
[10:06] <PatrickDickey> The section heading is "Install ubuntu alongside another Operating System."
[10:06] <BillyZane> yes, i see the something else option
[10:06] <ClientAlive> can someone remind me the command to find all unused packages? I thought it was sudo apt-get clean or *autoclean but after reading about them I'm not so sure that's what I'm looking for.
[10:06] <PatrickDickey> True dr_willis. I think it used to be "manually partition" or something like that.
[10:06] <BillyZane> oh yes
[10:06] <PatrickDickey> sudo apt-get autoremove will remove unneeded packages.
[10:07] <BillyZane> what is apt-get
[10:07] <dr_willis> It jus sounds weird to say to some one   'use the somthing else button'
[10:07] <BillyZane> actually.. what is apt
[10:07] <PatrickDickey> It's how you install software (via the command line).
[10:07] <dr_willis> !apt
[10:07] <ubottu> APT is the Advanced Package Tool, which together with dpkg forms the basic Ubuntu package management toolkit. Short apt-get manual: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGetHowto - Also see !Synaptic (Gnome), !Muon (KDE) or !Apper (KDE)
[10:08] <dr_willis> You got a lot of reading to do. ;)
[10:08] <BillyZane> ohhh i see, i installed synaptic on this virtualbox, it's like an app store
[10:08] <PatrickDickey> LOL And plenty of time to do it in.
[10:08] <PatrickDickey> Synaptic is a graphical frontend for apt/dpkg.
[10:08] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  the whold idea of a 'store' is a bit.. well.. demeaning ::) for what apt can do.. heh
[10:08] <BillyZane> it was an analogy, but you're right
[10:08] <BillyZane> it's an app repository for mankind
[10:09] <dr_willis> Apt/synaptic has been around LONG LONG befor there was even the term  'app store'
[10:09] <ClientAlive> PatrickDickey: thanks
[10:09] <PatrickDickey> No problem ClientAlive.
[10:09] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  we keep out packages in a 'repository' not a store. ;)
[10:09] <BillyZane> dr_willis, true that. i have offended linux, for that i am sorry
[10:09] <BillyZane> actually, linux is the GNU OS right?
[10:10] <dr_willis> Its amazeing how useless some of these 'other' app stores are becoming with flood of junk
[10:10] <dr_willis> !hurd
[10:10] <ubottu> The GNU Hurd is the GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel. It is not ready for production use, as there are still many bugs and missing features. http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html
[10:10] <BillyZane> i was reading linux got picked up cause GNU was looking for an OS and BSD was in some legal dispute at the time, so they settled with linux
[10:10] <PatrickDickey> Linux is the kernel basically.
[10:10] <BillyZane> i'ma check out hurd
[10:10] <dr_willis> Linux uses the HURD stuff for its skelton. i gues syou can say
[10:11] <dr_willis> its analogy day
[10:11] <BillyZane> errrr .. sorry, not GNU, BSD
[10:11] <BillyZane> i am currently still downloading linux installer

[10:12] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : GNU came from Richard Stallman ... father of open source so to speak
[10:12] <BillyZane> what's this?
[10:12] <BillyZane> it says grub a bunch of times
[10:12] <BillyZane> guessing it's a grub thingy
[10:12] <BillyZane> script?
[10:12] <BillyZane> how do i use that?
[10:13] <BillyZane> i have to run kate or nano
[10:13] <BillyZane> copy it in to the window
[10:13] <BillyZane> save it
[10:13] <ubuntun00b> hi all .. i just started playing with ubuntu server .. .   my problem is .. on eth0, if I use ipv6 it works fine .. but as soon as I change it to br0, it stops to work .. is there any special setting to make ipv6 work in br0
[10:13] <BillyZane> then what
[10:13] <dr_willis> we are not sure what you are talking about BillyZane
[10:13] <BillyZane> crap
[10:13] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: remove splash from the /etc/default/grub file.
[10:13] <BillyZane> donttrustem pasted something, i thought it was intended for me
[10:13] <BillyZane> n/m
[10:14] <PatrickDickey> Nope, it was his GRUB config. He's having boot issues.
[10:14] <BillyZane> ohhh
[10:14] <BillyZane> makes sense
[10:15] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1768725 the last comment mentions removing splash, and that removes the vt.handoff portion.

[10:18] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: so just remove the spalsh
[10:18] <BillyZane> actually, i would just hire you as over paid consultants

[10:18] <rigo> hi
[10:18] <PatrickDickey> Hi rigo
[10:19] <rigo> i download the 12.10 x64 full 763mib cd, try to install it with cli or cli-expert, but it sais: no kernel image: cli found
[10:19] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: one question is 12.10 better?
[10:20] <rigo> like the netinst version i only would like to ignore downloading the packages each time..
[10:20] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: It's a matter of opinion. I think so. Although I went to Lubuntu, instead of Ubuntu.
[10:20] <rigo> simply because it is slow...
[10:20] <donttrustem_> PatrickDickey: also do I remove the quiet
[10:21]  * PatrickDickey wonders if his iPad thought he wanted to quit
[10:21] <donttrustem_> lol
[10:21] <donttrustem_> possibley
[10:22] <donttrustem_> I  am on the acer at the moment
[10:22]  * rigo confused
[10:22] <PatrickDickey> LOL I saw that you were in here twice, right after I typed that. And no, I don't think you need to remove the quiet.
[10:22] <donttrustem_> OK ... lets try this now
[10:23] <JesusAlos_> hi. What is the appropiate hardware configuration for ubuntu server 12.04?
[10:23] <JesusAlos_> a goog hardware configuration
[10:24] <JesusAlos_> I buy a PC an want to know this
[10:24] <PatrickDickey> JesusAlos_: do you mean the system requirements?
[10:24] <JesusAlos_> yes. But not basic requeriments
[10:24] <JesusAlos_> good requeriments
[10:24] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: yoooo!!   all working and much faster as well
[10:24] <nuftau> I think you don't need az very good hardward configuration, because i'm on a very very old computer (2002)
[10:24] <PatrickDickey> What do you plan to do with it JesusAlos_?
[10:25] <nuftau> *a
[10:25] <PatrickDickey> Awesome donttrustem. :D
[10:25] <JesusAlos_> for office server
[10:25] <donttrustem> PatrickDickey: Thanks for all your help...
[10:25] <JesusAlos_> 4 computers
[10:25] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: No problem. I'm glad you got it figured out. :D
[10:25] <JesusAlos_> files server, web server, ssh server, LAMP
[10:25] <donttrustem> now I just need to install skype and restore the email
[10:26] <savr> hi
[10:26] <nuftau> hi
[10:26] <intxk> hi
[10:26] <PatrickDickey> JesusAlos_: Well to give you an idea, I'm running a home server, which has the file, web, dhcp, dns, etc on an older computer.
[10:26] <nuftau> I have just a question
[10:27] <PatrickDickey> ask away.
[10:27] <nuftau> what is the best app for emails
[10:27] <nuftau> ?
[10:27] <Ben64> !best | nuftau
[10:27] <ubottu> nuftau: Usually, there is no single "best" application to perform a given task. It's up to you to choose, depending on your preferences, features you require, and other factors. Do NOT take polls in the channel. If you insist on getting people's opinions, ask BestBot in #ubuntu-bots.
[10:27] <nuftau> logic.
[10:27] <donttrustem> where is the network browser in ubuntu
[10:28] <Ben64> donttrustem: menu -> places -> network
[10:28] <PatrickDickey> donttrustem: Nautilus (the folder on the left hand side). It'll be an entry there.
[10:28] <PatrickDickey> "Browse network"
[10:28] <JesusAlos_> I want to know details like the moderboard better with RAID
[10:29] <PatrickDickey> nuftau: another answer to your question, although the bot has the better one, is it depends on what you're doing. And what capabilities your email account has.
[10:29] <JesusAlos_> for example
[10:29] <savr> I've got a botched ubuntu install. I don't really have time to debug it. I've got a free partition. I don't have any install media ready. Is there an easy way to install ubuntu on a new partition from a ubuntu install? I'm really only interested if it is simpler than going to the corner store and buying a blank DVD. The way I know how to do this isn't so simple and requires using grub to boot the install media off the hdd. I don't have the time for this me
[10:29] <savr> thod...
[10:30] <Ben64> savr: flash drive?
[10:30] <savr> don't have an empty one
[10:30] <Ben64> doesn't have to be empty
[10:30] <PatrickDickey> savr: How did you install Ubuntu originally?
[10:30] <savr> and buying a DVD is quicker for me
[10:30] <savr> USB...
[10:30] <Ben64> if you're too lazy to do anything, then why ask
[10:30] <PatrickDickey> Do you still have that stick?
[10:31] <savr> really I don't have time... I have no media ready
[10:31] <savr> it is quicker to go buy a DVD
[10:31] <kepler> then you answered your own question
[10:31] <donttrustem> hmm! ... keep getting invalid argument when trying to copy files from my mac to ubunutu
[10:31] <PatrickDickey> savr: That's your best option then. Otherwise, debugging the botched install is good too.
[10:31] <kepler> donttrustem, first problem, you have a mac!
[10:31] <savr> Ben64: I'm not lazy I don't have time. I could boot it off grub...
[10:32] <PatrickDickey> savr: Do me a favor, please. Define botched.
[10:32] <donttrustem> kepler:LOL
[10:32] <kepler> donttrustem, how are you copying?
[10:32] <donttrustem> drag and drop
[10:33] <donttrustem> even tried copy
[10:33] <savr> PatrickDickey: super fucked up... something like 15 boot/path errors
[10:33] <savr> probably a sign of a failing hard drive to be honest
[10:33] <kepler> can you ssh to your ubuntu machine?
[10:34] <donttrustem> let me try to ssh from ubuntu
[10:34] <kepler> on the mac, i would scp the files over, provided ssh is running on your ubuntu machine
[10:34] <PatrickDickey> JesusAlos_: https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/amd64/minimum-hardware-reqts.html is the best that I can get you about system requirements. Basically pick something better than those.
[10:35] <rigo> so is there a way to install a minimal system with the standard ubuntu install disk?
[10:35] <PatrickDickey> savr: if it's probably a failing hard drive, then it wouldn't help to install on another partition (unless that's on another drive).
[10:35] <savr> PatrickDickey: I got work to do... I know...
[10:36] <PatrickDickey> rigo: http://askubuntu.com/questions/203122/how-do-i-do-a-minimal-install-without-an-internet-connection
[10:36] <savr> you know what I should just buy a new laptop
[10:36] <savr> I already got someone who wants to take this one off me
[10:36] <PatrickDickey> savr: Probably, if the drive is failing. But, you'll either want to fix this one for them, or restore whatever was on it originally.
[10:36] <ioria> rigo: you can download the mini iso
[10:36] <PatrickDickey> Unless they know it's borked.
[10:36] <savr> patholio: they can fix it themselves...
[10:37] <savr> it's family...
[10:37] <savr> I was meant to give this laptop to them in a month
[10:37] <rigo> checkin. i download the mini iso and i have to download all the neccesary packages. which i dont want to. cause its slow.

[10:38] <savr> anyone know if it is available?
[10:38] <PatrickDickey> savr: as for what laptop to get, how much do you want to spend on it? I can recommend a couple that have Ubuntu installed (and working).
[10:38] <savr> PatrickDickey: their problem really...
[10:38] <Benxyzzy> What's the highest Xorg log level? If I just put -logverbose 999 will that work?
[10:38] <ioria> rigo: you can try the command line installation ...
[10:38] <kepler> PatrickDickey, any of them ultrabooks with a gigabit NIC on board?
[10:38] <savr> PatrickDickey: at this point it doesn't matter not being able to work is costing me more money than $1k+- for a laptop
[10:39] <kepler> and better than 1366x768 res
[10:39] <rigo> yep. i burn the standard disk, run it press esc, and type in cli but than i receive an EM
[10:39] <PatrickDickey> Dell has one, System 76 is a manufacturer of Linux Laptops.
[10:39] <jakepiano> hi how would i connect to an ethernet connection?
[10:39] <kepler> jakepiano, plug it in?
[10:40] <jakepiano> yup i did but its not connecting
[10:40] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: it should connect automatically, if you have a dhcp server somewhere (router, modem, server).
[10:40] <savr> Please wait 58 minutes for test to complete.
[10:40] <kepler> open up a terminal and ifconfig -a
[10:40] <savr> ok... smart is testing the drive...
[10:40] <kepler> see if eth0 shows up
[10:40] <donttrustem> how do you add apps to the launcher
[10:40] <ioria> rigo: you should have at start a menu  - installation- -command line installation -memory test - etc etc ...
[10:40] <Sgeo> YoltA private messaged me with some nonsense about wanting to talk about our origins
[10:40] <jakepiano> eth0 does not show up
[10:40] <kepler> what is in there?
[10:41] <kepler> wlan0 and lo?
[10:41] <jakepiano> kepler lo and wlan0
[10:41] <kepler> dont think you have the drivers for your card then
[10:41] <rigo> if i download the standard 12.10 x64 installation disk from the downloads site?
[10:41] <savr> PatrickDickey: this is a dell. I am really pissed off at how they handle onsite warrenties. they treat me like an idiot. I had problems with this laptop a while back and it was a pain in the arse to get them to send someone to fix it.
[10:42] <jakepiano> well i recently switched from windows 8 to ubuntu and its a fairly new computer. why wouldn't it work?
[10:42] <PatrickDickey> savr: I feel the pain. A friend of mine went through a bunch of hassle with Dell. I'd look at System 76 then. There's one more, but I can't think of it offhand.
[10:42] <kepler> what kind of ethernet card is it?
[10:42] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: Do you have a wireless router?
[10:43] <savr> the bluetooth chip failed and they just were wasting endless time. it took like an hour to explain to them that I'm not using windows and it isn't a fucking driver problem and I can't download their driver upload and install it because I'm not on windows.
[10:43] <ioria> rigo: the mini installation it's not so slow .... maybe faster then download the complete iso ... and on the website you have all the instructions
[10:43] <jakepiano> i'm kind of new to this too.
[10:43] <jakepiano> and i'm not sure
[10:43] <savr> it was a fried chip and their morons have to follow this idiotic script before they can send someone to fix it
[10:44] <rigo> im messing up the system in every 2 hours until i get the realy GOOD installation :) im a noob. thatswhy i would need the offline installation method.
[10:44] <savr> I don't even know why I paid for onsite warranty... with the same money I could have replaced the bluetooth chip myself faster and cheaper
[10:44] <rigo> so i install the ubuntu today
[10:44] <jakepiano> kepler how would i get the drivers?
[10:44] <rigo> so i'll install the ubuntu about 30x today :D
[10:44] <kepler> jakepiano, try: lspci | grep -i eth

[10:44] <nuftau> Hi. I have a little problem when I download a package; i download about 10 kB/s on the middle of the day, and 250kB/s on night... Is it because of Ubuntu's servers, or because of my connection?

[10:45] <kepler> nuftau, i get 3/4MBps down, so not sure if it is ubuntu, maybe whichever mirror you're hitting
[10:45] <rigo> nuftau you should select the nearest server. so choose your country for the fastest method
[10:46] <jakepiano> ok i did that i think except i'm not sure how to do the vertical bar. or does it matter. it gave me something weird
[10:46] <PatrickDickey> savr: System 76 and ZaReason both offer Linux laptops.
[10:46] <kepler> it is shift \
[10:46] <kepler> should be under your backspace
[10:46] <kepler> or you can copy and paste that
[10:46] <nuftau> thanks.
[10:46] <savr> PatrickDickey: I can't pick those up in a store
[10:46] <jakepiano> copy and paste works too. :p
[10:46] <savr> plus I want an ultrabook with a touch screen
[10:47] <PatrickDickey> savr: Then you'll have to install it manually.
[10:47] <savr> I can do that easily
[10:47] <savr> I've been using linux for over a decade exclusively
[10:47] <savr> I'm no noob

[10:47] <savr> ok... I think I'm just going to store and picking up whatever I can
[10:47] <kepler> ok, so it sees something there

[10:55] <jakepiano> yes
[10:55] <Guest37030> compiz trouble!!!
[10:55] <kepler> assuming you're on that machine connected to wireless, start at the sudo apt-get thing
[10:55] <PatrickDickey> Copy and paste is your friend. ;)
[10:55] <kepler> that last block of code
[10:55] <kepler> c/p one at a time, should be ok

[10:57] <PatrickDickey> jakepiano: each line that you see in there, is one line. Nothing wraps inside of the code block.
[10:57] <jakepiano> ok excellent thats what i was wondering. thanks
[10:58] <PatrickDickey> And you want to do them one at a time, because after you do the sudo apt-get line, it prompts you for your password. If you copy all of them at once, you'll enter the second line as your password.
[10:58] <kepler> and i really doubt that is your password

[10:59] <enzotib> hi, to make a textual installation (alternate is no more available) it is ok to use 12.10 server, then install ubuntu-desktop?
[11:00] <BillyZane> ok i'm back. i replaced the power supply of my PC
[11:00] <BillyZane> i'll be right back
[11:00] <BillyZane> switching computers
[11:00] <PatrickDickey> enzotib: you have to use server to do a minimal install, yes.
[11:00] <enzotib> thank you PatrickDickey
[11:01] <dr_willis> enzotib:  you can just use the text mode option to a desktop install to not load the login manager
[11:01] <dr_willis> enzotib:  ive found it easier to install services on a desktop instll. then convert a server install into a desktop
[11:01] <PatrickDickey> enzotib: Actually, ioria suggested http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD for a minimal cd.
[11:01] <Tex_Nick> Guest37030 : what distro
[11:01] <lester_> #join toonloop
[11:01] <tocacar> I've tried several times to install Ubuntu desktop (12.10 and 12.04 versions) in Oracle VirtualBox on Windows 8 - I get a weird bus error when the vobx first opens then the installer runs fine but when I restart, I'm prompted to install Ubuntu all over again :(  Any ideas?
[11:02] <lester_> join #toonloop
[11:02] <kepler> tocacar, run win8 in the vm, ubuntu as the host :D:D
[11:02] <dr_willis> tocacar:  Hmm. ive installed ubuntu dozens of times in vbox on windows 7.
[11:02] <PatrickDickey> lester, you need to type /join #toonloop
[11:02] <tocacar> dr_willis: this is windows 8
[11:02] <enzotib> PatrickDickey, i'm not looking for a minimal install, but for how to do what in 12.04 was the alternate cd, how to do in 12.10 something more or less equivalent
[11:02] <dr_willis> tocacar:   i dont see how that would really matter.
[11:02] <BillyZane> hello
[11:03] <BillyZane> what is the preferred way to install ubuntu, CD or USB?
[11:03] <lester_> thanks PatrickDickey
[11:03] <dr_willis> tocacar:  and i cant imagine what would say to install it over again. unless you left the install cd in the vortial disk drive
[11:03] <PatrickDickey> enzotib: Then my understanding is the server CD is what you want.
[11:03] <tocacar> kepler: haha - I even tried installing it as dual boot, but it gave me a scary 'windows failed to boot' black screen so I uninstalled that
[11:03] <enzotib> dr_willis, where is the text mode option?
[11:03] <BillyZane> i think i'll go with CD
[11:03] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  DVD for 12.10 or usb
[11:03] <dr_willis> !text | enzotib
[11:03] <ubottu> enzotib: To start your system in text-only mode append 'text' (without the quotes) to the kernel line in the grub menu. You can access the grub menu by pressing Esc (Grub legacy) or Shift (Grub2) during boot. For more info see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions#Text%20Mode

[11:04] <rigo> i type in help -> F3 it sais: cli or expert for expert command line installation. i go out to the boot: prompt type in cli and it sais:
[11:04] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  then use USB - 12.10 will Not fit on a normal cd
[11:04] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: then USB is your only option. it's too big for a CD.
[11:04] <rigo> no kernel image: cli found.
[11:04] <BillyZane> it's 763mb ... i guess it's too big
[11:05]  * tocacar has to reinstall all over again first because I deleted my vm in a fit of peak :)
[11:05] <enzotib> dr_willis, but it will gives the command line only? how to start installation then?
[11:05] <BillyZane> umm.. i might have DVDs

[11:06] <dr_willis> enzotib:  you use the GUI installer.. then have the actual install use text mode
[11:06] <dr_willis> BillyZane:  usb is the normal way and i find it a lot faster
[11:06] <PatrickDickey> rigo, it just boots to a boot: menu regardless of what you do, right?
[11:06] <dr_willis> Optical media - how old skool. :P
[11:07] <MonkeyDust> BillyZane  USB is 'the new normal'
[11:07] <PatrickDickey> Speaking of which, I need to update my Backtrack USB.
[11:07] <BillyZane> dr_willis: yeah but i have a really cheap USB drive, it's a transforming USB drive. however, i feel if i put it through too much "stress", it might fail on me
[11:08] <BillyZane> paranoia based on technological ignorance
[11:08]  * tocacar goes to clean the bathroom while the installer is running
[11:08] <rigo> i take pictures... please wait
[11:08] <BillyZane> secondly, i just like the idea of having an Ubuntu boot up disk
[11:09] <Ben64> rigo: you can't just type random things on a ubuntu disc and have it work
[11:09] <rigo> i know. thatswhy i type in what the HELP page sais.
[11:09] <rigo> it saied cli for command line install
[11:09] <Ben64> what help page
[11:09] <rigo> i show it please wait. i take some pics
[11:09] <Ben64> no, which help page
[11:10] <savr> PatrickDickey: I really experienced in this... don't worry. I have purchased about a dozen laptops to install linux on in my lifetime...
[11:11] <dr_willis> USB flash drives are dirt cheap... ive never had one die on me yet either..
[11:11] <dr_willis> Ive defainatly had issues burning disks and  them getting damaged
[11:11] <WXZ> is there anything besides gnome 2 which has panel apps?
[11:11] <killer> xfce
[11:12] <dr_willis> WXZ:  windowmaker has a huge amount of 'warf' applets/ ;)
[11:12] <PatrickDickey> savr: I'm not doubting you. The first link I found researching it sounded like it's not working. I just don't want you to buy an ultrabook, and find out that it won't work.
[11:12] <Ben64> dr_willis: i've had a flash drive die, 512MB :(
[11:12] <dr_willis> wxz or just use a dock
[11:12] <butviktor> UEFI  better or not?
[11:12] <dr_willis> Ben64:  when was this? 1812? ;)
[11:12] <WXZ> dr_willis: ok
[11:12] <savr> ok bye...
[11:13]  * PatrickDickey had a couple of thumb drives die also a few years ago. San Disk cheap ones
[11:13] <kepler> that dude was pretty abrasive.
[11:13] <butviktor> any point?
[11:13] <PatrickDickey> He'll be back.
[11:13] <skp1> my dog chewed up a flash drive
[11:14] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: It's more updated and modern than BIOS. But whether it's better or not is a matter of opinion.
[11:14] <kepler> jakepiano_, any luck with that ethernet?
[11:14] <Tex_Nick> BillyZane : 12.10 has grown out of it's diapers and is now just barely larger than a CD ... in the future you might want to use DVD-RW's ... although they are a little more expensive
[11:14] <dr_willis> skp1 i had a grandson chew through a Cat5 Cable. ;)
[11:14] <ni291187> hi
[11:14] <butviktor> can ubuntu installable with UEFI?
[11:14] <ni291187> this is billy zany typing from my ipad
[11:15] <jakepiano_> i was just about to report on that actually. yes as soon as i hit the last command it connected. thanks!
[11:15] <ctsck> hi guys
[11:15] <dr_willis> butviktor:  yes - it should be
[11:15] <kepler> sweet
[11:15] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: Unless it's an ARM (Secure Boot) tablet. Then, thank Microsoft for it not working.
[11:15] <ctsck> i want make a friend
[11:15] <ni291187> errr... yeah. billyzane is me. I will attempt an install soon
[11:15] <BillyZane> hi, i gotta restart for this
[11:16] <MonkeyDust> ctsck  type /join #ubuntu-offtopic for social chat
[11:16] <Tex_Nick> dr_willis : lol the neighbor's dog chewed through xmas tree light cord ... they buried him :(
[11:16] <rigo> soo
[11:16] <BillyZane> PatrickDickey and or dr_willis, i'm about to restart so the only way i can contact you guys is through the install CD or the ipad as a backup
[11:16] <BillyZane> are you guys going to be up ?
[11:16] <BillyZane> i can't sleep, i'm cracking out on this
[11:16] <dr_willis> theres dozens here to help install. and it shouldent be that hard.
[11:16] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane: I'll be up for another hour or two. I work nights, and it's only 5:16 am here.
[11:17] <dr_willis> you could een do a test install in virtualbox if you wanted
[11:17] <BillyZane> ok, ty
[11:17] <BillyZane> dr_willis, i have
[11:17] <BillyZane> now i want MOAR
[11:17] <MonkeyDust> BillyZane  due to different time zones, this channel never sleeps
[11:17] <BillyZane> I NEED MORE!
[11:17] <BillyZane> that's true
[11:17] <BillyZane> sigh.. is this goodbye to windows?
[11:17] <BillyZane> i really like windows tbh
[11:18] <dr_willis> I could have had Ubuntu isntalled about 8 times by now BillyZane .....
[11:18] <rigo> i can explain it better now.
[11:18] <dr_willis> windows would take me 3 days to get set up right
[11:19] <BillyZane> ok guys, i'm closing out everything
[11:19] <butviktor> i have meet some kind of laptops can only boot with ubuntu? can not even install windows 8.why?cdrom usb just can't install other os? what the....
[11:19] <dr_willis> and you can IRC from the installer's live dvd desktop BillyZane
[11:19] <dr_willis> Ive never seen or heard of a laptop that can only boot with ubuntu.
[11:20] <dr_willis> i would be doubtfull if anyone makes such a thing
[11:20] <PatrickDickey> Might have been an older laptop.
[11:20] <BillyZane> i'll still be here by virtue of the VNC
[11:20] <BillyZane> i'll be talking throuhg...
[11:20] <ni291187> hi
[11:20] <BillyZane> that dude
[11:20] <BillyZane> ok, brb
=== rusty is now known as Guest58853
[11:21] <butviktor> no, all new with UEFI.
[11:22] <genteor> hello fellas!on my ubuntu 12.04 seems that some applets don't run due to missin' java plugin. what packages should I install please?
[11:22] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: Then it probably didn't have secureboot enabled or something like that. Otherwise it should have installed Windows 8. The only issues that I've heard of are ARM tablets, because you're not supposed to be able to bypass SecureBoot.
[11:22] <butviktor> any one know that?
[11:22] <dr_willis> !java | genteor
[11:22] <ubottu> genteor: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[11:23] <butviktor> x86 intel only boot ubuntu.yeah only!
[11:24] <butviktor> there is no opinions for other os to boot!
[11:24] <dr_willis> butviktor:  i would have to see such a thing to belive it.. its not really an Ubuntu related support question either. ;)
[11:24] <rigo> at this point i press escape: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/59/dscf6646q.jpg/
[11:25] <rigo> dont look at the homer simpson bed :D
[11:25] <butviktor> i am using one of them now!
[11:25] <rigo> i get this: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/21/dscf6647e.jpg/
[11:25] <rigo> than i type help at the boot: prompt. http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/27/dscf6651e.jpg/
[11:25]  * tocacar restarts and hopes to get it working this time...
[11:25] <rigo> i get this http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/717/dscf6652.jpg/

[11:26] <beboj> can anyone help me to solve that issue - http://askubuntu.com/questions/235859/running-sierra-wireless-gobi-2000-under-ubuntu
[11:26] <rigo> got the point?
[11:27] <Ben64> rigo: like i asked you twice, which help page
[11:27] <rigo> like i show it on the picture thisone: http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/717/dscf6652.jpg/
[11:28] <MonkeyDust> rigo  havent followed - what were you doing prior to that page?
[11:29] <butviktor> i know it not normal ,you don't even believe it,but can any one can help me install other os on it ? thanks.
[11:29] <tocacar> OK, how do I remove the .iso file from storage in Oracle VBox? I see it under 'Controller:IDE' in Settings/Storage, but not how to remove it
[11:29] <ShapeShifter499> I have a powerbook g4 running Ubuntu 12.04 and I'm wondering if I can have my system boot straight to xbmc and not load the desktop for optimal ram
[11:29] <rigo> at the startup i press esc, go out to a command line mode where i can see only a prompt: boot: where i type help
[11:29] <ShapeShifter499> And if so, how would I do that?
[11:29] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: You have Ubuntu installed, and are trying to install Windows 8. What errors do you get when you boot to the LiveCD/USB?
[11:30] <PatrickDickey> rigo, why are you pressing escape?
[11:30] <ni291187> are you guys aware of the intel 3770k fan problem? I'm fingering my CPU fan in an attempt to get it to spin
[11:30] <tocacar> ok, right clicking and removing attachment seems to have removed it.. I am now starting my Ubuntu vbox.. fingers crossed
[11:30] <rigo> cause i only want to install a small command line system
[11:31] <butviktor> no boot opinions show, UEFI only have one boot: ubuntu .nothing else!
[11:31] <tocacar> ..and its looking good..  WOOHOO! It's working
[11:31] <PatrickDickey> Hit Enter, and at the first screen, hit F4. That should bring up the option to do a minimal install.
[11:31] <rigo> it doesnt. wait i take a picture :D
[11:31] <MonkeyDust> !yay| tocacar
[11:31] <ubottu> tocacar: Glad you made it! :-)
[11:31] <tocacar> HUGE thanks to everyone who helped me! :)
[11:31] <dr_willis> tocacar:  might be worth the time reading the vbox manual also. ;)
[11:31] <PatrickDickey> rigo, you downloaded the Minimal installation one, or the Server one?
[11:31] <tocacar> Now off to install Apache, PHP and MySQL - have a great day guys
[11:31] <tocacar> bye
[11:31] <ni291187> ok, I should be booting up soon
[11:32] <tocacar> for(h0me)
[11:32] <tocacar> crap
[11:32] <butviktor> i am not joke,it is ture!
[11:32] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: Let us know when you get to the screen that I showed you (where it finds your other operating system).
[11:32] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: does it say GRUB at the top, by chance?
[11:32] <ni291187> ok
[11:32] <CrByte> I am thinking about installing ubuntu on my macbook air as the only OS if its supported does anyone know if it runs well on Ubuntu 12.10? if so is there post install software that needs to be installed?
[11:33] <iceroot> !mac | CrByte
[11:33] <ubottu> CrByte: For help on installing and using Ubuntu on a mac, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MactelSupportTeam/CommunityHelpPages
[11:33] <Ben64> rigo: you can't do that on desktop disc
[11:33] <azrael_> Hi everyone, I've a problem with the ath9k driver for my Atheros AR9285 controller. The signal is very very low even if I'm near the AP and the connection is very unstable. Any idea?
[11:33] <rigo> oh. i c.
[11:33] <butviktor> no grub shows,it is i never seen before
[11:33] <PatrickDickey> rigo:  you need to download the server installation disc. The "minimal Install" one will install a desktop.
[11:33] <rigo> than i download the server version. is there any difference between the server and the desktop version?
[11:34] <ni291187> Patrick, should I click try Ubuntu in order to get irc working, or will I be able to access irc during installation regardless?
[11:34] <killer>  i am unable to connect to adhoc created by my  frnd ...i m using b43 and i can connect to ad hoc using windows on same machine
[11:34] <PatrickDickey> The server is more geared for a minimal installation, because typically servers aren't used as desktops.... Except for mine. :P
[11:34] <iceroot> rigo: the server does not have a gui by default
[11:34] <iceroot> rigo: rest is the same
[11:34] <rigo> thats my stuff! thanks :)
[11:35] <rigo> gosh.. it was a bit hard because of my poor english. sorry. and thanks for the help again.
[11:35] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: I'd do the Try Ubuntu, then come in here. Then open the installer on the desktop.
[11:35] <rigo> now i can mess up the system in every 10 minutes and reinstall it :))
[11:35] <PatrickDickey> No problem rigo.
[11:35] <PatrickDickey> what's your first language, out of curiosity?
[11:36] <rigo> hungarian. than german and english. a bit spanish dutch and french.
[11:36] <butviktor> chinese
[11:36] <ni291187> I'm at the something else screen!
[11:36] <Assurbanipal> hi guys,is there a trusted ppa for latest chromium?I look around in internet and find some repos from unknown maintaners that i do not know and trust.What's the best way to have a latest stable chromium in ubuntu?
[11:36] <PatrickDickey> ok ni291187. Choose Something else, and click Next.
[11:37] <ni291187> done
[11:37] <yaquya> just finished installing ubuntu 12.10 to MB Air, everything works, no need to tweak anything after install :)
[11:37] <rigo> C, C++, C#, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, all the HTML shit, and a Java beginner :D
[11:37] <dr_willis> ppa's are sort of untrusted by default. ;)
[11:37] <PatrickDickey> Assurbanipal: chromium is in the ubuntu repositories. Or you can download Google Chrome.
[11:37] <rigo> and i cant deal with ubuntu... just great. :D
[11:37] <ni291187> I see 2 ntdf drives, which is good, I see a free unmessed with segment
[11:37] <Assurbanipal> PatrickDickey: is the one in ubuntu repos the latest stable?
[11:37] <butviktor> anyone can help me?please
[11:37] <CrByte> iceroot: looking at that wiki page it does not list any of the 2012 models under the supported list so would that mean its not going to work very well?
[11:38] <PatrickDickey> I'll let you know in a minute Assurbanipal.
[11:38] <ni291187> I will be typing weird stuff due to ipad nonsense
[11:38] <PatrickDickey> hungarian | rigo
[11:38] <xiaoy> butviktor, what's the problem?
[11:38] <iceroot> CrByte: i dont know, luckily i dont own this strange apple-stuff
[11:38] <butviktor> can only boot ubuntu no boot can other os!!!
[11:38] <genteor> ubottu:thx!
[11:39] <PatrickDickey> Assurbanipal: Version 22.0.1229.94 Ubuntu 12.10 (161065)
[11:39] <dr_willis> butviktor:  booting is differnt than 'installing'   so clarify what you mean
[11:39] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: click on the free unallocated space, and create your partitions there.
[11:39] <rigo> sadly im not an englishman or american or german. i wouldnt sit here for 1700 monthly. :)
[11:39] <butviktor> no opitions to boot from cdrom and usb,what should i do?
[11:40] <coder2> hey guys on decreasing screen brightness my dell studio laptop shows random bars, can anyone help?
[11:40] <ni291187> I see a + button on the left side, should I click that?
[11:40] <PatrickDickey> rigo, there is a hungarian language room also. Just in case you need help that we can't provide.
[11:40] <Assurbanipal> butviktor: for that you have to check the settings in your bios menu
[11:40] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: yes.
[11:40] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: Make sure you've clicked on the unallocated space first though.
[11:40] <butviktor> it is UEFI!!ok?
[11:41] <sonda> i know C,C++.  I want to write my own application in ubuntu
=== uni4dfx is now known as zz_uni4dfx
[11:41] <sonda> can someone help me get started with ubuntu
[11:41] <butviktor> i checked but still no
[11:41] <rigo> gr8 thanks. my experience is that i get help faster in english the common language :)
[11:41] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: what kind of computer is it? Make and model.
[11:41] <PatrickDickey> manual | sonda
[11:41] <coder2> sonda, google ubuntu quickly
[11:41] <ni291187> interesting, I can place the partition at the end of the space, being able to locate the space is useful when resizing
[11:41] <PatrickDickey> !manual | sonda

[11:41] <ioria> sonda : install gcc g++
[11:42] <ioria> sonda : then geany or code blocks or anjuta
[11:42] <MonkeyDust> sonda  ##c++ and #ubuntu-app-devel
[11:42] <ni291187> Patrick, should it be logical or primary
[11:42] <butviktor> i buy it last month
[11:42] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: Try primary for /. It depends on how many "Primary partitions" you have right now though.
[11:42] <butviktor> before this month
[11:43] <ni291187> I think primary is best too...
[11:43] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: The reason I'm asking for the brand and model, is so I can make sure of how to boot to the DVD.
[11:43] <sonda> thanks guys. I'll go through the manual
[11:43] <PatrickDickey> No problem Sonda.
[11:44] <ni291187> I'll give / and /home 200 gb each?
[11:45] <MonkeyDust> ni291187  15 for / is enough (unless you're a gamer)
[11:45] <sonda> is it user's manual?
[11:45] <sonda> i want developer's manual
[11:45] <ni291187> I want to install a bunch of apps though
[11:45] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: That'll work. You probably won't ever use that much for /. Maybe go 50G for / since you don't know how much you'll need for your projects.
[11:45] <ni291187> ok, I give 60 :)
[11:46] <PatrickDickey> sonda, it's a user manual. If you want a developer's, I'd say go to #ubuntu-app-devel like MonkeyDust suggested.
[11:46] <sonda> oh ok
[11:46] <srhb> xdg-open on a magnet links seems to just open a new chromium window for me. What might be the cause?
[11:46] <greg> Hi guys, I wan to access /var/www via FTP and SMB, any suggests for rights/configuration of vsftp/samba?
[11:46] <butviktor> sorry, it is not safe here, so i just want to ask have anyone meet this situation before?
[11:46] <MonkeyDust> greg  ubuntu server?
[11:47] <PatrickDickey> srhb: do you have a client installed for magnet links?
[11:47] <greg> MonkeyDust: yeah, lts version
[11:47] <srhb> PatrickDickey: Yes, Deluge.

[11:47] <greg> MonkeyDust: ty
[11:47] <ni291187> how much for home?
[11:47] <ni291187> 100?
[11:48] <PatrickDickey> butviktor: no, I've never had that situation. My suggestion is google something like booting (brand and model of computer) from DVD.
[11:48] <ni291187> I feel like a billionaire
[11:48] <dr_willis> dient we have a huge disussion about the partion sizes earlier? ;)
[11:48] <ni291187> 100 billion bytes!
[11:48] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: I'd say at least 200.

[11:48] <ni291187> primary as well
[11:48] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: logical
[11:48] <ni291187> ok...
[11:48] <ni291187> ext4 right?
[11:49] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: You're only allowed four primary partitions, so you don't want to waste them.
[11:49] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: yes ext4.
[11:49] <dr_willis> You can have up to 4 primary partitions. One of those can be a Extended that can hold a great many logicals.
[11:49] <ni291187> good point
[11:49] <butviktor> will thank you friend,iwill try
[11:49] <dr_willis> of course with GPT this dosent apply i belive. ;)

[11:52] <ni291187> should I encrypt home folder?
[11:52] <qqqqq> alimj, why not?
[11:53] <dr_willis> ni291187:  i wouldent. unless its a laptop you are afraid might stolen
[11:53] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: I normally don't. I'd say until you've played around, no.
[11:53] <dr_willis> and you have state secrets on it
[11:53] <ni291187> ok, Ty
[11:53] <alimj> qqqqqqq: Because even the HTTPS header that contains URL is encrypted
[11:53]  * PatrickDickey keeps all of the State Secrets on my server
[11:54] <dr_willis> I used to keep them on that server the gov shutdown. ;)
[11:54] <dr_willis> so now the gov cant get their own secrets.
[11:54] <qqqqq> For example can my Internet provider see that I access the file niceinfo.html on https://www.newssite.somedomain/somepath/niceinfo.html ?
[11:54] <ni291187> lol
[11:54] <PatrickDickey> Wikileaks?
[11:54] <alimj> q^5: No
[11:55] <alimj> q^5: But if you want to have the maximum security and privacy, use Onion routing
[11:55] <qqqqq> alimj, so the Internet provider can only see that I access the IP but not the path?
[11:55] <PatrickDickey> qqqqq: The only people who should be able to see what page/file you accessed are you, and maybe the server that hosts the page/file. But, I don't even think the server would keep track of that, since it's a SECURED connection.
[11:56] <kmicu> Some disk usage indicator exists? Short visual feedback that I can put on top panel or desktop instead of typing df in terminal? ;)
[11:56] <ni291187> are drivers going to be an issue for me? I have new hardware
[11:56] <dr_willis> kmicu:  a lot of people use conky for that. its on the desktop however.
[11:56] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: They might. But most of the newer hardware is supported.
[11:56] <dr_willis> kmicu:  or use 'watch df -h' in a terminal   ;P
[11:57] <kmicu> conky is an overkill for visual df
[11:57]  * PatrickDickey uses conky for it
[11:57] <alimj> q^5: Yes, they can see that you are communicating with that server, but they will have no idea about the content
[11:57] <qqqqq> But when I access https://www.newssite.somedomain/somepath/niceinfo.html directly this request goes through DNS first.
[11:57] <dr_willis> you can use conky to run  df and have it on the desktop in big Pink fonts!
[11:57] <riddlebox> what is the bug in 12.10 that stops the broadcom-sta driver from installing correctly? It works from the live cd but after you install it quits and you cannot install it?
[11:58] <alimj> q^5: Only www.newssite.somedomain goes through DNS
[11:58] <alimj> q^5: /somepath/niceinfo.html goes through HTTPS header
[11:59] <alimj> q^5: and even DNS request goes only once (They it will be cached)
[11:59] <ni291187> can I view drives on the local home group easily?
[11:59] <dr_willis> ni291187:  you can assess windows shares.
[11:59] <PatrickDickey> kmicu: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1527171/ is an example of my conky configuration. It shows disk usage along with top processes.
[11:59] <kmicu> Then some system-monitor-indicator for disk usage doesn't exist :/
[11:59] <ni291187> it's restarting ATM
[12:00] <dr_willis> kmicu:  more likely theres dozens of them.. it depends on the details. thers loads of unofficial/not in the repo indicator-applets
[12:00] <qqqqq> alimj, so lets says I am in China, Burma, etc. and want to access a wordpress blog. Each blog is basically a separate "project", they wouldn't know what blog I access if wordpress uses https?
[12:00] <kmicu> I can't find any panel indicator for disk usage :)
[12:00] <PatrickDickey> qqqqq: when you access the site, your computer asks the dns server for the ip address of the domain (www.newsite.com). After that, everything is IP based.
[12:00] <dr_willis> many docks have the disk ussage monitors also.
[12:00] <alimj> q^5: The answer is yes. The would not know
[12:00] <Elvinz> qqqqq, I guess they will, as the adress is in the clear
[12:00] <ni291187> I'm in grub, loading Ubuntu
[12:00] <dr_willis> kmicu:  you mean for the gnome-classic type panels? or the unity panel?
[12:01] <kmicu> unity panel
[12:01] <Elvinz> qqqqq, you might be better of encrypting everything via a proxy
[12:01] <dr_willis> kmicu:  search for 'indicator applets' that may have what you want. theres dozens of them mentioned at askubuntu.com thats not in the repos
[12:01] <alimj> q^5: However, if you want to have maximum anonymity, use onion routing/ TOR proxy
[12:01] <ni291187> ok, I'm logged in
[12:01] <PatrickDickey> qqqqq: I second alimj's idea. Use The Onion Router, if you're that worried.
[12:01] <kmicu> I'll try cron job with lib-notify, but it will be ugly solution :)
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest57473
[12:02] <kmicu> dr_willis: no indicator applets for disk usage :)
[12:03] <dr_willis> kmicu:  I would think  you should look harder. i seem to recall some. but im on a console only system. so cant look
[12:03] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: WOOOHOOOO :D
[12:03] <MonkeyDust> !tor | qqqqq alimj
[12:03] <ubottu> qqqqq alimj: Tor is a program to route connections through several servers for anonymity. It is in Ubuntu's repositories, but the Tor Project recommends using their Tor packages due to past issues with Ubuntu's. For setup info, see option (2) of https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en | To use Tor on freenode, see !tor-sasl
[12:03] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: Does everything seem to be working?
[12:03] <dr_willis> there are generic indicator-applet examples in python you could make show whatever info you wanted
[12:03] <qqqqq> PatrickDickey, I already use Tor but for some applications Tor is too slow.
[12:04] <kmicu> Or I can gparted my disk and give more space for my partition... nvm
[12:04] <PatrickDickey> kmicu: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/tag/indicator-applets
[12:04] <coder2> how to set the boot option in ubuntu 11.10 "acpi_backlight=vendor"
[12:04] <MonkeyDust> coder2  11.10 is no longer supported
[12:04] <ni291187> I'm in Ubuntu and I can access the network
[12:04] <alimj> q^5: Use the Obscuring version. Please note that it is beta
[12:04] <qqqqq> PatrickDickey, I am not THAT worried but it is none of my ISP damn business what I look at. I pay for the access to the Internet.
[12:04] <dr_willis> coder2:  grub2 = /etc/default/grub   No idea what 11.10 uses
[12:05] <coder2> MonkeyDust, tell me for 12.10 then :)
[12:05] <kmicu> PatrickDickey: And where is disk usage one? :)
[12:05] <qqqqq> MonkeyDust, I have been using Tor for many years.
[12:05] <coder2> dr_willis, thanks buddy as always :)
[12:06] <ni291187> thank you patrocldickey, dr_willis
[12:06] <qqqqq> It was rather a technical question so I know what is going on when I don't use Tor or someone else doesn't.
[12:06] <PatrickDickey> No problem ni291187. Glad you got it going.
[12:07] <alimj> q^5: We hope that it is clear for you now...
[12:07] <hansol> im searching a website from where can i extract emails (free)
[12:07] <qqqqq> alimj, what obscuring versoin?
[12:08] <ni291187> I like it, but.. this install is not like the one I had for the virtualbox, much easier, but... I don't have kde. can is there a way I can select the GUI on boot up?
[12:08] <alimj> q^5: Let me send you the URL
[12:08] <qqqqq> alimj, yes thx for the help.
[12:08] <dr_willis> ni291187:  install the desktop you want ise the menus on the login screen
[12:08] <dr_willis> this may be mentioned in that ubuntu manual
[12:09] <angs> what is the command to search a directory name to locate?
[12:09] <alimj> q^5: https://www.torproject.org/projects/obfsproxy.html.en
[12:09] <ni291187> oooo... should have read it more :x
[12:09] <ni291187> I'm updating ATM so I can't do anything
[12:09] <riddlebox> why does normal unity drain my battery on my laptop so fast? If I use 2D mode I get way more battery life and unity seems to respond better
[12:09] <PatrickDickey> kmicu: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/10/easily-monitor-system-usage-in-ubuntu-12-10-with-syspeek or http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/02/easily-monitor-system-resources-in-ubuntu-with-indicator-multiload or http://askubuntu.com/questions/30334/what-application-indicators-are-available should get you started.

[12:10] <MonkeyDust> angs  there's find and locate
[12:10] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: install kubuntu-desktop and then you'll click the little circle by your name on the login screen.
[12:10] <qqqqq> alimj, thx
=== zz_uni4dfx is now known as uni4dfx
[12:10] <angs> thank you MonkeyDust
[12:10] <dr_willis> They really need to make that Circle menu button Much more obvious.
[12:10] <ni291187> Patrick, soon as this update finishes, I'll do just that
[12:11] <dr_willis> you may want to use unity for a while.. since all the docs basically assume you are using unity. ;)
[12:11] <alimj> q^5: You are welcome. Or you can use some fast L2TP/IPSec and/or OpenVPN from some providers that honor customer privacy
[12:11] <PatrickDickey> dr_willis: I agree. Too bad some of the people in charge aren't in here.
[12:11] <dr_willis> I still dont know whats up with the little grid of dots on the login screen
[12:11] <kmicu> PatrickDickey: I have tried them all, but no prefs for disk usage in all of them ;] Anyway thx.
[12:11] <damian__^> hi, i have overclocked my GMA 950 using setpci, specifically:  sudo setpci -s 02.0 f0.b=00,60  | sudo setpci -s 02.0 f0.b=33,05, how can i check its clock speed. the fan is definately running faster and it is a little hotter but can i print the current clock speed somehow?
[12:11] <alimj> q^5: Since ISPs are controlling torrent traffic in some countries, many are using such services
[12:12] <PatrickDickey> kmicu: Did you google disk usage indicator applets ubuntu 12.10? You might find the one you want there.
[12:12] <PatrickDickey> Or just use a conky script like the OMG!Ubuntu site discusses.
[12:12] <kmicu> Yes. ;]
[12:13] <PatrickDickey> I don't remember the grid of dots.. Are they near the top right, or where?
[12:13] <PatrickDickey> Unless it's the accessibility one (virtual keyboard and such).
[12:13] <tocacar> Grrr.. I'm just getting a blank (purple) screen when I log into my Ubuntu 12.10 vbox - how can I fix it?
[12:13] <dr_willis> PatrickDickey:  across the whole screen last time i looked. i always used some tweak to remove them actually im using GDM now...
[12:13] <ni291187> omg ,I just discovered the workspace switcher
[12:13] <hansol> im searching one website (big database for registrations, e-mails) from whre i can search some emails it was with white background, anyone can help me ???
[12:14] <qqqqq> Does anybody know whether the Firefox plugin https everywhere requires Tor to be installed?
[12:14] <PatrickDickey> Ahhh ok. I think I know what you're talking about. When it first boots up? Or maybe I don't.
[12:14] <dr_willis> hansol:  thats not very clear what you need help with
[12:14] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: Just think of the possibilities you can do with that. :D
[12:14] <dr_willis> PatrickDickey:  the lightdm wallpaper used to have some overlay of white dots.
[12:14] <rigo> one more thing.. does it makes any sence to upgrade the system to the latest v3.7.2-raring ?
[12:15] <PatrickDickey> Not sure then. The only dots I remember are when it boots up, and it's a progress bar. Of course, I don't use the lightdm wallpaper.
[12:15] <tocacar> why do I have no dock, no icons, no menus?
[12:15] <dr_willis> ring0:  only if you want to be a beta tester and submit bugs.. and expect lots of weirdness
[12:15] <angs> how can I see hidden files on nautilus?
[12:15] <alimj> q^5: No. It does not require TOR
[12:15] <dr_willis> tocacar:  3d support is lacking. and unity/compiz is not fully loading
[12:15] <ni291187> Patrick, I could reduce my need to drag windows around! which I constantly do on windows
[12:15] <MonkeyDust> angs  vtrl-h
[12:15] <MonkeyDust> angs  ctrl-h
[12:15] <PatrickDickey> VIew > SHow Hidden Files
[12:15] <ni291187> they should call windows 7, drag windows
[12:15] <angs> thank you MonkeyDust
[12:15] <tocacar> dr_willis: is it hard to fix? I have no idea what to do
[12:15] <angs> and PatrickDickey
[12:16] <apm1> is there a way i can put the unity-launcher bar in horizontal mode
[12:16] <apm1> kinda like a dock
[12:16] <dr_willis> tocacar:  i tend to run lubuntu in vbox. since 3d eyecandy would slow down  the vm a lot.
[12:16] <kmicu> PatrickDickey: Is conky still a cpu hog?
[12:16] <dr_willis> apm1:  not really. You can just install a dock.
[12:16] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: I was thinking more about your projects that you mentioned earlier. YOu could set up an entire workspace for each one.
[12:16] <qqqqq> I think https everywhere is the best Firefox extension ever. Then again I read that SSL is broken.
[12:16] <tocacar> dr_willis: lubuntu...never heard of that. I'll google it
[12:16] <tocacar> dr_willis: is it just going to install and run? I'm sick of faffing around
[12:16] <dr_willis> tocacar:  sudo apt-get install lubuntu-desktop ;) its the lightest full featured desktop/variant of ubuntu
[12:16] <skp1> apm1: google unity bottom launcher
[12:17] <dr_willis> any unity hacks to move it to the bottom are basically not supported here.. and last i looked at them.. were very flakey
[12:17] <ioria> tocarar: it's with the LXDE de very light...
[12:17] <PatrickDickey> Not really kmicu. I've got conky, skype, terminal, google chrome, quassel, and thunderbird open. And my cpu is only using around 35%.
[12:17] <rigo> ?
[12:17] <PatrickDickey> tocacar: I'm using lubuntu right now.
[12:18] <dr_willis> tocacar:  you could just use a window manager if you wanted like openbox.. it will take about 90 sec i imagine to get openbox installed. ;)
[12:18] <ioria> tocarar: i'm running lubuntu on a pentium 3 with 500mb  pc133 ram
[12:18] <PatrickDickey> apm1: Check the settings. There used to be an option for where the launcher was.
[12:18] <apm1> PatrickDickey, i checked nothing there to move it
[12:18] <kmicu> But i have weak laptop and my /usr/bin/X takes 20% CPU :P
[12:18] <tocacar> dr_willis: PatrickDickey: I'm just running that lubuntu-desktop installer now (I'm totally new to Ubuntu...does it show? heh)
[12:19] <PatrickDickey> tocacar: we all were, at one point or another.
[12:19] <dr_willis> tocacar:  luubntu in vbox on a windows system .. is a handy tool.
[12:19] <apm1> any way i can remove the launcher all together ?
[12:19] <MonkeyDust> tocacar  we're always glad to welcome new users
[12:19] <rigo> nevermind i install it :D
[12:19] <dr_willis> apm1:  use a differnt desktop if you dont want unity
[12:19] <tocacar> I'm so glad you guys are here and online - I appreciate your help
[12:20] <apm1> dr_willis, i like it except for the launcher :p
[12:20] <dr_willis> apm1:  customize and make your own desktop if you want to go  fancy
[12:20] <PatrickDickey> lubuntu actually comes with the OpenBox Configuration Manager.
[12:20] <dr_willis> apm1:  the launcher basically is  the desktop in unity... its the core of the whole thing
[12:20] <PatrickDickey> apm1: When you login, you can use Gnome Classic. Or install Gnome-desktop.
[12:20] <dr_willis> so im not sure what else ther is to like/dislike
[12:21] <PatrickDickey> rigo, what are you installing?
[12:21] <rigo> the latest v3.7.2-raring ?
[12:21] <dr_willis> You can install some fancy dock and have it at the bottom of the unity desktop. and set the unity panel to auto hide
[12:22] <rigo> shit. i got dpkg: error processing linux-headers-3.7.2-030702-generic (--install):  dependency problems - leaving unconfigured
[12:22] <ni291187> you know?i feel it's running kinda slow. is there a system performance... like things are slow. compiz crashes. sometimes the system freezes for a few seconds
[12:22] <PatrickDickey> dr_willis replied to you earlier. only if you want to be a beta tester, report bugs, and experience weirdness.
[12:22] <dr_willis> ni291187:  and your video card is?
[12:22] <apm1> dr_willis, the top panel
[12:22] <apm1> ok since without the launcher unity is crippled then xfce is my last resort
[12:22] <MonkeyDust> apm1  try docky, if you like fancy eyecandy
[12:22] <dr_willis> apm1:  theres many other desktops out..
[12:22] <dr_willis> apm1:  go experiment.
[12:23] <ni291187> dr_willis, gtx 660
[12:23] <PatrickDickey> apm1: Try kde. The launcher is on the bottom.
[12:23] <dr_willis> ni291187:  you have installed the nvidia drivers yet? there should have been a pop up window prompting you.
[12:23] <ni291187> nope
[12:23] <dr_willis> there ya go. ;)
[12:23] <ni291187> if I install them, would they work with kde as well?
[12:23] <PatrickDickey> I think you can find it in Software Sources on the last tab (Additional Drivers) ni291187.
[12:24] <dr_willis> I normally install the 'nvidia-current' package for my nvidia cards..not sure what a gtx660 uses
[12:24] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: drivers are hardware. They work with the kernel.
[12:24] <ni291187> I mean, it's sooo slow... I can't believe how long Kvirc is taking
[12:24] <dr_willis> ni291187:  the desktop runs on tops of the linux OS.. so they all use the same core.
[12:24] <tocacar> hmm, as this installs I'm seeing a lot of 'package not found's hope its going to work out :S
[12:24] <ni291187> ok
[12:24] <PatrickDickey> well, technically they're software. but they work with the kernel. So, they'll work with whatever desktop you have.
[12:24] <dr_willis> ni291187:  You allready have kubuntu-desktop installed?
[12:24] <ni291187> how do I install the Linux drivers?
[12:25] <ni291187> not yet
[12:25] <dr_willis> so how can kvirc be slow if its not installed yet?
[12:25] <ni291187> I mean the installation
[12:25] <ni291187> should I install the drivers first?
[12:25] <dr_willis> ni291187:  that would be your download speed then... that has nothign to do with video drivers
[12:25]  * tocacar restarts the vb
[12:26] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: You can do it one of a few ways. Look in Software Sources, on the Additional Drivers tab. It'll tell you if there are drivers available. Or, if you know which nvidia driver you need, you can use sudo apt-get install nvidia- (like sudo apt-get install nvidia-current) in a terminal.
[12:27] <dr_willis> night all...

[12:36] <PatrickDickey> rigo: http://lawrit.lawr.ucdavis.edu/it-help-center/how-to/upgrading-ubuntu-via-command-line might be a good start
[12:38] <rigo> thanks
[12:49] <BillyZane|2> hmm? netsplit
[12:50] <damian__^> whats the best looking distro?
[12:50] <PatrickDickey> Ooops. I fell out.
[12:51] <BillyZane|2> wb
[12:51] <PatrickDickey> thanks.
[12:51] <MonkeyDust> damian__^  pinguy OS is overkill eyecandy
[12:51] <BillyZane|2> patrick, i couldn't find it on the repository, so i was going to just download them from the nvidia website
[12:51] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane|2: did you try sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[12:51] <Invisible|3> :)
[12:52] <PatrickDickey> That's most lilkely what you need.
[12:52] <BillyZane|2> i haven't, to be honest, i don't know how to enter konsole from this GUI
[12:52] <BillyZane|2> is there a run .. oh wait
[12:52] <BillyZane|2> i know where it is, under apps
[12:52] <PatrickDickey> CTRL+Alt+T keys
[12:52] <PatrickDickey> Or, click the launcher and type Terminal
[12:52] <damian__^> thanks monkeydust, ill check it out
[12:52] <BillyZane|2> ooo... nice
[12:52] <MonkeyDust> damian__^  mind: not supported here
[12:53] <damian__^> of course :)
[12:53] <BillyZane|2> umm... you know, i'm losing things that i opened
[12:53] <BillyZane|2> should they all be on the left side if opened?
[12:53] <Eagleman> How do i allow the user jrpoot to login on jrpoot@jrpoot.eu and deny login on jrpoot@eagleman.net in dovecot ?
[12:53] <BillyZane|2> oh i found it
[12:53] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane|2: move your cursor to the left side and the launcher should open. They'll have a little arrow next to them.
[12:54] <PatrickDickey> Eagleman: you'll have more luck in #dovecot than here.
[12:55] <BillyZane|2> patrickdickey apt-get does what again? does it just download the application? i was using something called aptitude on KDE before
[12:55] <damian__^> btw, does someone know, will ubuntu mobile eventually be merged into ubuntu? so they are the same os? i have seen the galaxy nexus build and heard that you can simply bring it home, plug in a keyboard mouse and monitor and have a fill ubuntu desktop..?
[12:55] <damian__^> full*
[12:55] <PatrickDickey> apt-get is a variation of aptitude.
[12:55] <PatrickDickey> It does the same thing, with some minor limitations.
[12:55] <damian__^> or will ubuntu mobile be a different product that offers a full desktop too?
[12:56] <BillyZane|2> what is the variation? how can i learn of these variations like you know
[12:56] <MonkeyDust> damian__^  better ask in #ubuntu-phone
[12:56] <BillyZane|2> how can i learn all the little details, is there a good book for learning this
[12:56] <PatrickDickey> It's just another backend for dpkg.  dpkg is the actual installer, apt (apt-get) and aptitude are the backends that you use.
[12:57] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane|2: how familiar are you with aptitude?
[12:57] <damian__^> oh, hehe, thanks again monkeydust
[12:57] <BillyZane|2> i know how to use the command  sudo aptitude install program
[12:57] <ioria> there is olsa Gdebi
[12:57] <llutz> !aptitude
[12:57] <ubottu> aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[12:57] <ioria> also
[12:57] <PatrickDickey> it's the same thing with apt. Except you'll say apt-get.
[12:58] <BillyZane|2> why are there two versions, why not just use apt-get
[12:58] <PatrickDickey> There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[12:58] <ioria> i love cats
[12:58] <iceroot> BillyZane|2: please dont use aptitude when you are using amd64 (64bit)
[12:59] <BillyZane|2> i am currently using the amd64 version
[12:59] <PatrickDickey> It's all about preference. Some like aptitude, some like apt-get, some like compiling from source, and some refuse to use a command line at all.
[12:59] <iceroot> BillyZane|2: then please dont use aptitude, use apt-get or the software-center
[12:59] <BillyZane|2> hmm... so using apt-get only downloads the source?
[12:59] <BillyZane|2> oh n/m
[12:59] <ActionParsnip> Patrickdickey: how is apt-get 'with minor limitations'?
[12:59] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane|2: no. apt-get does the complete installation.
[13:00] <ioria> no it looks for dependencies and install the program
[13:00] <BillyZane|2> iceroot, why shouldn't i use aptitude with amd64?
[13:00] <llutz> BillyZane|2:  See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[13:00] <iceroot> BillyZane|2: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/aptitude/+bug/831768
[13:00] <ubottu> Launchpad bug 831768 in aptitude (Ubuntu Precise) "aptitude cannot handle conflicts with multiarch enabled" [High,Confirmed]
[13:00] <PatrickDickey> ActionParsnip: I was going from a bad memory. Since aptitude seems to have different features.
[13:00] <MonkeyDust> BillyZane|2  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto?action=show&redirect=AptGetHowto
[13:01] <ActionParsnip> Billyzane|2: stick to apt-get, it handles multi-arch wheras aptitude does not. Patrickdickey you should also know this
[13:01] <BillyZane|2> i have no idea what that means
[13:01] <BillyZane|2> but i'll stick to apt-get
[13:01] <BillyZane|2> evidently it's the same thing
[13:01] <iceroot> BillyZane|2: its just means "dont use aptitude" :)
[13:01] <BillyZane|2> lol
[13:01] <iceroot> BillyZane|2: apt-get is not the same thing as aptitude but its doing what you want, installing software
[13:02] <ActionParsnip> Billyzane|2: its similar,  but you have 64bit and the dual arch needs appreciating
[13:02] <BillyZane|2> i stand corrected
[13:02] <iceroot> BillyZane|2: there are things which can be done with aptitude better then with apt-get and there are things which can be done better with apt-get. for normal software-installations apt-get is the recommend way on ubuntu when you want to use the command lione

[13:03] <srhb> I really don't understand the xdg-open script. Given a magnet link, the execution path tries to see if it's a file (fails) and otherwise just calls the browser with the link. This doesn't make sense at all to me.

[13:05] <njd001> but does Canonical teach ubuntu is there an online class somewhere?
[13:06] <BluesKaj> howdy all
[13:06] <ActionParsnip> Njd001: you can become Ubuntu certified. You need LPI101 and LPI102 first
[13:06] <cfhowlett> BluesKaj, greetings!
[13:06] <kris_therrien> Can anyone help me setup ircd hybrid?
[13:07] <BluesKaj> hey cfhowlett
[13:07] <ActionParsnip> !manual | Njd001 may also help
[13:07] <ubottu> Njd001 may also help: The Ubuntu Manual will help you become familiar with everyday tasks such as surfing the web, listening to music and scanning documents. With an emphasis on easy to follow instructions, it is suitable for all levels of experience. http://ubuntu-manual.org/
[13:07] <PatrickDickey> njd001: #ubuntu-classroom is where they do most of the educational things.
[13:08] <srhb> PatrickDickey: Thank you, the fact that it just does not handle magnet links in a generic environment was the issue.
[13:09] <ActionParsnip> Njd001: I find just using the OS teaches more than any book or lesson. Just like you probably learned Windows.......
[13:09] <PatrickDickey> srhb: Glad you found the answer. :)
[13:09] <srhb> The behaviour does seem buggy though, simply not handling them in the generic case, but I may miss a crucial point. Ah well, works now.
[13:10] <PatrickDickey> srhb: I'd bookmark that page, in case it breaks again.
[13:11] <srhb> PatrickDickey: Looks like it will for sure. Thanks. :-)
[13:11] <halides> 'lo
[13:11] <PatrickDickey> No problem. I'm thinking I need to do that too. Although I always use the .torrent file.
[13:11] <halides> having troubles with my synaptics
[13:11] <ActionParsnip> Halides: what issue
[13:12] <PatrickDickey> halides: what types of troubles?
[13:12] <halides> i have a touchpad with two buttons, such that the are where the buttons reside are also a part of the touchpad
[13:12] <halides> now, if i right-click with one finger and drag with another, i don't get f.ex. boxes on the desktop, but rather a two-finger scroll
[13:13] <halides> i tried disabling two-finger scroll with synclient, it still doesn't make the drag after the click, rather just discards the events
[13:13] <halides> this is on 12.04
[13:13] <halides> .1 LTS
[13:13] <halides> :-)
[13:14] <halides> i also have limited the area with AreaBottomEdge, but it still understands the click also as a touch
[13:14] <ActionParsnip> Halides: does the system have a make and model?
[13:15] <halides> it's a dell inspiron mini 1012
[13:16] <halides> http://patchwork.freedesktop.org/patch/9477/ this patch seems to be relevant, but pfffff i don't really want to go through all that hassle
[13:16] <halides> and then find out "oh, didn't work"
[13:16] <ushills> Any ideas how to sync an iPod touch with banshee

[13:18] <BillyZane|2> PatrickDickey: hey man, are you still around?
[13:18] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane|2: Yep.
[13:19] <BillyZane|2> i downloaded the linux drivers from the nvidia website, the file is a .run file, when i go to open it, it does it in the text editor
[13:19] <ushills> Doesn't seem to work with the latest firmwares, shows as a device but will not mount
[13:19] <ActionParsnip> Halides: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1443535
[13:19] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane|2: in the command line, you need to type chmod +x filename (where filename is what you downloaded).
[13:20] <BillyZane|2> what does that command do?
[13:20] <BillyZane|2> how does it work?
[13:20] <BillyZane|2> what is chmod , what is the +x for
[13:20] <PatrickDickey> chmod is change mode. +x is make it executable.
[13:21] <PatrickDickey> if you type ls -l with the filename, you'll probably see something like -rw-rw-rw- username username size date filename.run
[13:21] <BillyZane|2> so it's sorta like the equivilant of changing the file  extension on windows?
[13:21] <halides> ActionParsnip: yeah, that was i think the first page which i ran into when i started debugging this :-)
[13:21] <halides> but thanks for the effort :-)
[13:22] <PatrickDickey> Well it's more like telling windows that the extension is an executable file.
[13:22] <auronandace> BillyZane|2: why aren't you using the drivers in the repos?
[13:22] <BluesKaj> BillyZane|2, open a terminal and do ./nameofnvidiafile.run
[13:23] <PatrickDickey> auronandace: I'll take a crack at why not. I don't think he knows which driver he should use. He has a GTX 660, if I remember right.
[13:23] <ActionParsnip> Billyzane|2:  why not just run:  sudo apt-get install nvidia-current
[13:23] <BillyZane|2> i tried running it...
[13:23] <BillyZane|2> i did that also
[13:23] <BillyZane|2> but lets try it again
[13:23] <PatrickDickey> What happened?
[13:23] <BillyZane|2> i did it through the GUI
[13:24] <BillyZane|2> it downloaded, it installed
[13:24] <PatrickDickey> BillyZane|2: then you need to reboot, so it will use those drivers.
[13:24] <BillyZane|2> ok
[13:24] <ActionParsnip> Billyzane|2: the proposed repo has the 310 driver

[13:35] <samadhan> how to test md5?

[13:40] <ActionParsnip> Ni291187: sure, itsva package like any other, did you run the --initial command like on the binary driver how to
[13:40] <PatrickDickey> SapphireDensetsu: Do you have a linux computer set up for the demonstration?
[13:40] <ActionParsnip> Aurondance: thanks
[13:40] <WXZ> I'm having a bit of a problem understanding the difference between a window manager and a desktop environment
[13:41] <SapphireDensetsu> As a matter of fact, it's the computer I'm messaging from right now.
[13:41] <auronandace> SapphireDensetsu: what advantages can you think of?
[13:41] <PatrickDickey> SapphireDensetsu: what research have you done on advantages of linux vs windows?
[13:42] <MonkeyDust> WXZ  window manager is what makes your windows move on the screen, DE is what your desktop looks like, the bars and menus etc
[13:42] <SapphireDensetsu> In an educational setting, pretty much that it would be secure, it would be fast, they wouldn't have to be overburdened with new hardware, and that the students would like it.
[13:42] <PatrickDickey> 1. Fewer (read as very rare) viruses and malware. 2. Works on older hardware. 3. Less upfront cost (no license fees). There are a ton more.
[13:42] <SapphireDensetsu> Besides that?  I don't know.
[13:42] <WXZ> MonkeyDust: well that's where I have the problem, the awesome window manager for instance, it has it's own bars and menus, but it's a window manager
[13:43] <ioria> SapphireDensetsu: do you know how may errores the windows registry produces ? and at last the system is unrecoverable
[13:43] <MonkeyDust> WXZ  awesome is not for beginners, IMO
[13:43] <SapphireDensetsu> It's a red-flag Microsoft district, that's for certain.  But the teachers are frustrated with their inadequate hardware, and the demands of Windows.
[13:43] <WXZ> MonkeyDust: it's mandatory for me kind of
[13:43] <ActionParsnip> Ni291187: I assume you ran: sudo aticonfig --initial
[13:43] <_helios_> You guys might already be aware of this, but I got rid of Windows 7 completaly becaues I was browsing through the windows partition using linux and found some log files.  Them aholes at microsoft were logging every mouse movement I made.  Now if that isn't a privacy violation I dunno what is.
[13:44] <BRKsays> hey can anybody tell me whether openjdk is actively maintained or not?
[13:44] <SapphireDensetsu> As for working with Windows, I've used and converted dozens of systems, but this will be my first group repair.
[13:44] <PatrickDickey> ActionParsnip: he has a nvidia card. would he still run aticonfig?
[13:44] <MonkeyDust> WXZ  how so? low specs? maybe we can find a different solution
[13:44] <ActionParsnip> Patrickdickey: thought it was a ati
[13:44] <PatrickDickey> BRKsays: yes it is. Oracle doesn't officially support java on Linux anymore because OpenJDK is supposed to be up to par.
[13:45] <PatrickDickey> !java | BRKsays
[13:45] <ubottu> BRKsays: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.
[13:45] <WXZ> MonkeyDust: I need to be able to switch between workspaces on different monitors
[13:46] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: How're you doing there?
[13:46] <SapphireDensetsu> But anyways, I need the demonstration to be flawless, so that the teachers demand Linux in their classrooms.  Anyways, at least Ms. Orpurt already wants it.  On a somewhat unrelated side note, how does Xubuntu or Lubuntu do on a Wilamette Pentium 4?
[13:46] <_helios_> SapphireDensetsu, that is something you can add to your list Microsoft spys on its customers constantly they have hidden keyloggers pre-installed.
[13:46] <MonkeyDust> WXZ  not sure what you mean or where the problem lies
[13:47] <oliver__> hi there, I set chmod 2775 on a directory and now I cant remove it, I tried both chmod 775 and 0775 but the permissions stays the same

[13:47] <oliver__> i wont
[13:47] <oliver__> drwxrwxr-x
[13:47] <PatrickDickey> SapphireDensetsu: Probably better than Ubuntu, as they use a lightweight desktop manager.
[13:47] <WXZ> MonkeyDust: basically, I need a sort of zaphod-mode setup where I can move windows across desktops
[13:47] <somsip> oliver__: chmod g-s
[13:47] <ni291187> ummm... disaster
[13:47] <PatrickDickey> But SapphireDensetsu, you'll probably want something more like Edubuntu
[13:47] <SapphireDensetsu> Helios:  If I said that, they would say I'm out of my mind.  And yes, I've seen the NSAKEY symbol on debug/checked NT, so I know what you're talking about.
[13:47] <oliver__> somsip: thanks, worked!
[13:47] <WXZ> MonkeyDust: awesome provides a similar functionality where I can have 2 monitors, but set different workspaces on each monitor (monitor 1 = workspace 1, monitor 2 = workspace 2)
[13:48] <BRKsays> I have openjdk 7 installed. I asked because when I try to vrify my java version it says java 7 version 9. but it is outdated. there is a version 7.10. I'm not a developer. I just java for browsing. So should I install oracle too? I have heard oracle java is actively maintained and updates and fixes are provided?

[13:48] <ActionParsnip> Brksays: how did you install java?
[13:48] <PatrickDickey> BRKsays: technically right now, you shouldn't run Java at all. There's a security vulnerability for Java 7 Update 10 that affects everyone.
[13:48] <SapphireDensetsu> Yes, I probably would, but it would bring the poor old Wilamettes down to their knees, not to mention Unity.  I'd install Xubuntu, and then the Edubuntu packages for the best of both worlds.
[13:48] <_helios_> SapphireDensetsu, that's the problem these days and Windows 8 is even worse than Windows 7,  But nobody will believe you they spy even if you put the logs in there face...lol
[13:49] <disharmonic> evening
[13:49] <disharmonic>  Would you recommend mtpfs or simple-mtpfs for Android phones?
[13:50] <PatrickDickey> SapphireDensetsu: I'd say install it on one of the Wilamettes and use that for the demonstration. That way they can see it working in their real-time environment. You'll want to show them that they can still do whatever they need to do.
[13:50] <_helios_> I wouldn't recommend mtpfs at all lol
[13:50] <PatrickDickey> disharmonic: #ubuntu-phone
[13:50] <PatrickDickey> Well maybe not. Maybe #android instead.
[13:50] <disharmonic> PatrickDickey, this has nothing to do with Ubuntu for Phones
[13:51] <SapphireDensetsu> They wouldn't let me do that in a million years, especially considering my past history, and that I'm not technically enrolled.  But I can show them my Core 2 Duo laptop, which is the next best thing.
[13:51] <MonkeyDust> WXZ  ok, get it, but got to go - put that information in one line and repeat it from time to time - good luck!
[13:52] <ni291187> Patrick... Ubuntu won't work! the display drivers messed it up
[13:52] <PatrickDickey> SapphireDensetsu: Do you have access to a computer that has similar hardware specs to the Wilamettes?
[13:52] <disharmonic> PatrickDickey, both of those are FUSE implementations of MTP for linux.
[13:52] <WXZ> MonkeyDust: ok
[13:52] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: One second.
[13:52] <ni291187> ok
[13:52] <BRKsays> ActionParsnip: In firefox I recieved missing plugin. I tried to install. there were two options. Icedtea 6 and Icedtea 7. when I installed the whole openjdk was installed. I cheked USC and saw openjdk 7, icedtea 7 and web control panel are installed. What I am asking is for normal browsing and gaming stuff is openjdk 7 enough? and do I have to worry abou fixes and updates?
[13:52] <SapphireDensetsu> The closest I have is a big brute of a Northwood sitting around at my house.  Nothing to compare to the Wilamettes though, and certainly nothing I can pack up to the school and demonstrate.
[13:54] <_helios_> SapphireDensetsu, Are you doing this for a college?
[13:54] <_helios_> SapphireDensetsu, Just the fact that Ubuntu is free should get there attention lol
[13:55] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: which nvidia card is it again? So I can check to see which one it's supported by.
[13:55] <ni291187> gtx 660
[13:55] <SapphireDensetsu> No, I'm doing it for the Edwardsburg School District as a whole, a K-12 institution.  And that might get the teachers attention, but the adminstrators wouldn't budge.  I've actually contemplated compromising their servers to teach them a lesson in insecurity, but I've somehow restrained myself.
[13:55] <ni291187> all I see is my desktop background
[13:55] <disharmonic> _helios_, you meant i shouldn't use MTP at all? It's not really an option in my case
[13:55] <ni291187> ip can enter terminal
[13:55] <_helios_> SapphireDensetsu, I goto college and I have shown some people and my professor Ubuntu and they just can't believe its free.
[13:55] <ActionParsnip> Brksays: try: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java ; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
[13:56] <ActionParsnip> Brksays: it also has oracle-java8-installer
[13:56] <_helios_> disharmonic, I've just had bad experiences with mtp with a mp3 player I fixed for a friend.  Its a picky lil filesystem.
[13:57] <SapphireDensetsu> Yes, and Ms. Orpurt doesn't believe Linux is free even when I insist with my two own puppy-dog eyes.  But like I said, the teachers are no problem, and neither are the students, it's the adminstration.
[13:57] <BluesKaj> BRKsays, stick around and wait for a response , don't just repeat your question
[13:57] <BRKsays> ActionParsnip: okay. I'm gonna try that. thanks:-)
[13:58] <ActionParsnip> Brksays: easier to use a PPA
[13:59] <BRKsays> BluesKaj: I wasn't repeating. I was talking to ActionParsnip. Sorry if that was out of line.
[13:59] <BluesKaj> brs np, you finally did
[13:59] <BluesKaj> BRKsays,
[14:00] <njd001> srhb im not an all windows guy theres just differences between RHEL, bsd, Solaris besides im not paying for it.
[14:00] <SapphireDensetsu> And even then, the admins will object by saying that Linux doesn't teach children about the real world.  Okay then.  Amazon, Google, Facebook, DoD, are you listening?
[14:01] <njd001> SapphireDensetsu is that to me or ?
[14:01]  * njd001 has to spend his training budget
[14:01] <SapphireDensetsu> To no one, really.
[14:01] <njd001> use it or lose it :(
[14:02] <njd001> thank god they dont do that with PTO yet
[14:03] <BluesKaj> SapphireDensetsu, neither does Windows teach about the real world because they think they owm it
[14:03] <PatrickDickey> ni291187: yes you can remove the drivers. sudo apt-get remove nvidia-current will do it.

[14:03] <PatrickDickey> SapphireDensetsu: are you a student or faculty there?
[14:03] <njd001> also you guys recommend an AWESOME app called pastebin but it doesnt seem apt-get install knows about it perhaps im doing it wrong ? apt-get install pastebin?
[14:03] <bazhang> njd001, pastebinit
[14:04] <njd001> ahh
[14:04] <BluesKaj> !pastebinit
[14:04] <ubottu> pastebinit is the command-line equivalent of !pastebin - Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output - To use pastebinit, install the « pastebinit » package from a package manager - Simple usage: command | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com

[14:15] <XATRIX> Hi guys, how can i tell apt-get to remove *linux-image* (but exclude linux-image-3.6.8-pf-686) ?
[14:15] <XATRIX> Is there any --exclude ?
[14:17] <XATRIX> ?
[14:19] <yeats> XATRIX: no there's no
[14:19] <yeats> not
[14:24] <yeats> XATRIX: you could try something like sudo apt-get -s remove `dpkg --get-selections | grep linux-image | grep -v 'linux-image-3.6.8-pf-686' | awk '{print $1}'` (note that 'apt-get -s' means 'simulate' - you would need to remove that when you run it for real)
[14:26] <yeats> XATRIX: I recommend caution both with globbing (using *) and with scripts/chained bash commands like this since you could end up removing something important.  If there's not a need to remove the other kernels, I would let them remain.

[14:46] <ActionParsnip> Xatrix: you'll need more than just that one deb. Also, we cannot support the kernel here if you get issues

[15:33] <biopyte> dakota, i fixed the problem inspired by this info ... http://platonic.techfiz.info/2008/10/places-menu-broken-ubuntu-intrepid-upgrade/
[15:34] <dakotawulfy> biopyte cool so u got it working???
[15:34] <biopyte> for some reason i had a "vlc.desktop" entry in the inode/directory line
[15:34] <biopyte> yes, back to normal
[15:34] <wrrezt> yeats: I found it. The git-completion.bash is part of bash-completion and only called git: /etc/bash_completion.d/git.
[15:34] <biopyte> just deleted the "vlc.desktop" entry, that was it
[15:34] <yeats> wrrezt: ah
[15:35] <yeats> I wondered about that because git bash completion has always worked for me out of the box
[15:35] <wrrezt> yeats: Sorry, I am wrong. $ dpkg --search /etc/bash_completion.d/git
[15:35] <wrrezt> git: /etc/bash_completion.d/git
[15:35] <dakotawulfy> biopyte cool always good when u get it fixed
[15:35] <ActionParsnip> Acovrig: if you dd the drive to another drive, in theory it should work
[15:35] <escott> oal, do you have any other GPUs what version of ubuntu are you running?
[15:35] <oal> escott, no other GPUs. Ubuntu 12.10
[15:36] <biopyte> dakota, i didnt expect to work it out that fast ... i was lucky this time
[15:36] <oal> escott, I found this, might give it a shot: https://launchpad.net/~xorg-edgers/+archive/ppa
[15:36] <escott> oal, 12.10 should support sandys not sure why it would not work

[15:38] <edgy> hi, how can I restart iptables in ubuntu? already tried: $ sudo service iptables restart
[15:38] <edgy> iptables: unrecognized service
[15:39] <oal> ActionParsnip, http://hastebin.com/vuxunicebo
[15:39] <escott> edgy, iptables is not a service that runs in the background. the tables are loaded at the beginning and just sit in kernel. check if they are loaded with sudo iptables -L
[15:39] <yeats> edgy: with iptables you just issue commands (usually via a script) and it will retain that state until you log out
[15:40] <yeats> s/log out/reboot/
[15:40] <edgy> escott, yeats: but it used to be a service that we can stop and start, are you saying this is not true, or things has changed?
[15:40] <yeats> edgy: it's not a service
[15:42] <escott> edgy, there might have been an init script in the past to load iptables rules from a file, but its never been a proper "service" because it has no daemon
[15:42] <oal> ActionParsnip, did you find anything useful there?

[15:43] <edgy> yeats, escott: ok, now iptables -L showed some default rules, I did iptables -F to flush them temporarily and want to apply the defaults back, whatever this is called how can I do it?
[15:44] <escott> edgy, can't say whee you got your rules from. many people get rules from ufw
[15:44] <escott> !ufw | edgy
[15:44] <ubottu> edgy: Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution, has firewall capabilities built-in. The firewall is managed using the 'ufw' command - see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW | An alternative to ufw is the 'iptables' command - See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo | GUI frontends such as Gufw (GNOME) and Guarddog (KDE from Lucid onwards) also exist.

[15:45] <jimi_> how can I configure my laptop so that when I shut th elid, anything playing on HDMI out doesn't go blank?
[15:45] <edgy> escott: I didn't install ufw, so by default if i just install ubuntu desktop, iptables -L tables would be empty?
[15:45] <oal> ActionParsnip, I'm able to use my system, but it doesn't use the builtin GPU, so it's software rendering only (indirect)
[15:46] <escott> jimi_, (a) is your laptop designed for use with the lid closed. many laptops cannot be used in such a fashion
[15:46] <escott> edgy, i believe so
[15:46] <edgy> escott: ok, thanks, I will try to figure out where it's coming from then

[15:50] <sapro> i downloaded 5 times the iso.
[15:50] <sapro> from different sources.
[15:51] <ActionParsnip> Sapro: doesn't matter, you could (statistically) download a million and never get a good one
[15:51] <escott> edgy, it would be installed by default with ubuntu-desktop. perhaps it isn't activated b/c ive seen empty rules before
[15:51] <ActionParsnip> !md5 | Sapro

[15:54] <LiquidDemocracy> I want to switch from Ubuntu to Kubuntu. All my emails are in Evolution, though. How can I migrate them?
[15:54] <iceroot> how to stream music from PulseAudio to PulseAudio with 12.04 as client? padevchooser is not available anymore for newer releases
[15:55] <iceroot> LiquidDemocracy: you can still use evolution on kubuntu
[15:56] <LiquidDemocracy> But evolution is a Gnome GUI application.
[15:56] <iceroot> LiquidDemocracy: and?
[15:56] <LiquidDemocracy> I want a clean KDE.
[15:56] <LiquidDemocracy> And not copy all the required libraries over.
[15:56] <boss1_> fffff
[15:56] <iceroot> LiquidDemocracy: i dont think you want something aewfull like kontakt/kmail
[15:57] <iceroot> LiquidDemocracy: but when you are using imap for example you dont have to migrate, just sync the mails with the new client
[15:58] <LiquidDemocracy> No they don't exist on the server anymore.
[15:58] <solidoodlesuppor> Here's a weird one: Ubuntu loads into my VM without loading the dock. Just the desktop background, nothing else

[16:00] <North1> Hello all.  I am having problem working with the dd command...
[16:00] <North1> am trying to write an .img file to my SD card and all I get is
[16:00] <North1> dd: unrecognised operand '/dev/sdb'
[16:01] <yeats> North1: can you pastebin the full command you're using?
[16:01] <North1> sure.
[16:01] <escott> North1, dd if=/path/to/file.img of=/dev/sdb

[16:03] <North1> sudo dd bs=1M if= ~/2012-12-16-wheezy-raspbian.img of= /dev/sdb
[16:03] <bekks> Without the " "
[16:03] <North1> escott I gave the full path
[16:03] <escott> acovrig, don't use redirection with dd
[16:03] <jonnybal> I don't want to force a reboot as I think a long file operation may still be going on
[16:03] <escott> North1, no spaces
[16:04] <North1> sorry ? No spaces between ?
[16:04] <ActionParsnip> Acovrig: the second drive will be /dev/sdb    sda2 is the secind paetition in the first drive
[16:04] <acovrig> escott: is the general idea correct? (I was however planning on dd if=dev | pv -pterbs <size>M >file)
[16:04] <escott> North1, between of= and the argument same for if=
[16:05] <North1> okay lemme try.
[16:05] <North1> I will get back to u with the result
[16:05] <escott> acovrig, not sure what you are trying to do. just the dd if=something > something.else is silly
[16:05] <boss1> j
[16:05] <North1> Yes Escott... its working now... Silly me not to check
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> Solidoodlesuppor: not really,  it needs 3D acceleration.  If its not around then it won't load. If the system is a VM then I recommend you use XFCE or LXDE to give a more responsive OS
[16:06] <ubuntuaddicted> does anyone know how to uninstall a game from steam client?
[16:06] <eristikophiles> anyone ever have problems with 'too many files open'? i can't seem to find a cause for it / what program might be doing it. i can't run anything to check stuff like with ps to see what's running, and i got more ram put in the box but it hasn't solved it (though it does run faster).
[16:06] <atlef> !grub > atlef
[16:06] <ubottu> atlef, please see my private message
[16:07] <acovrig> escott: thats the only way I know how to do it (running through pv)
[16:07] <jonnybal> Actionparsnip: I can't get to a terminal as I just have a black screen
[16:07] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: try     lsof    to see the open files
[16:07] <eristikophiles> ulimit is unlimited and file max is at like 333k-something
[16:07] <eristikophiles> i can't run anything
[16:07] <escott> acovrig, pipe is sensible. redirection is silly
[16:07] <ActionParsnip> Jonnybal:   so pressing:  ctrl + alt + f1     doesn't get a terminal?
[16:07] <eristikophiles> if i reboot i can, for awhile, but then it comes back. but i can't cause it either. no idea what's doing it
[16:08] <nicofs> I need a little help... I just put two files onto my thumb drive on my pc - but on my netbook they are not there. if i reinsert the drive into the pc, they are there again... this happend with fat32 and ext4... why?
[16:08] <eristikophiles> so i can't figure out how to find the problem, since it only appears when i can't run any apps
[16:08] <acovrig> escott: dd if=/dev/sda1 | pv -pterbs 81920M >2.dd (as far as I know, pv doesn't have an 'of' equivalent
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: before you oull it out, do you safely remove it, then pulk it out?
[16:09] <amr_> when you feel that you need to remove your ubuntu totally and reinstall it FRESH?
[16:09] <dakotawulfy>  nicofs use the command line
[16:09] <bekks> ActionParsnip: No. DONT use | or > with dd.
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> Jonnybal: does the keypress nit work?
[16:09] <janeyre> hi everyone
[16:09] <dakotawulfy> if u need them right now
[16:09] <ActionParsnip> Bekks: wrong target?
[16:09] <escott> eristikophiles, you might want to enable a limit per process see if you can cause whatever process (assuming its a single process) to die
[16:10] <dakotawulfy>  nicofs i have seen that problem
[16:10] <bekks> acovrig: dd bs=16M if=/dev/sda1 of=/your/file1.dd
[16:10] <nicofs> dakotawulfy, use cli to do what exactly? basic things like "copy" and eject? this must work via gui on this os...
[16:11] <eristikophiles> should i limit # of files open, or threads? or what?
[16:11] <nicofs> dakotawulfy, ls on the device lists the missing files - nevertheless my file manager should show them... something went wrong somewhere. repeatedly...
[16:12] <eristikophiles> i mean, it should just force things to go slower to wait for their turn at opening files if i do that, right?
[16:12] <dakotawulfy>  nicofs: well  open up terminal in that dir   make sure they are there
[16:12] <escott> acovrig, for these kinds of full reads from a device you probably dont even need to use dd. something like pv -options </dev/sda1  >sda1.img should be fine
[16:12] <dakotawulfy>  and copy from that
[16:12] <acovrig> bekks: I know that, but pv gives a progress bar, and I am kinda fond of that
[16:12] <dakotawulfy>  is see what i can find give me a sec
[16:12] <bekks> acovrig: Then use pv only ...
[16:12] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: before you pull the USB storage our, do you use the safely remove feature in your IS beforehand?
[16:12] <bekks> Or mbuffer.
[16:12] <eristikophiles> ActionParsnip- there's no usb storage involved
[16:12] <eristikophiles> i haven't added or removed any
[16:13] <nicofs> dakotawulfy, i did not install ubuntu to do everything via cli - especially not those trivial things... I want to find and solve the issue... and if a simple process like copy does not work, it is something worth investigating...
[16:14] <dakotawulfy> nicofs ok file are not dont have a . in front of them right ???
[16:15] <nicofs> dakotawulfy, they are not hidden...
[16:15] <dakotawulfy> ok
[16:15] <nicofs> dakotawulfy, i copied them via file manager and ejected the volume...
[16:15] <dakotawulfy>  yes  i have had that happen
[16:16] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: before you pull the USB out, do you use the safe remove feature
[16:16] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: sorry, wrong target
[16:16] <nicofs> ActionParsnip, I am only offered the "eject" option...
[16:16] <nicofs> but I do use that
[16:17] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: should be ok. Does the partition pass fsck?
[16:17] <eristikophiles> oh i see nicofs talking about that now :)
[16:17] <jonnybal> Actionparsnip: I get cannot find user guest
[16:17] <nicofs> ActionParsnip, on it...
[16:17] <ActionParsnip> Johhnybal: but the key combo gave a terminal....
[16:17] <jonnybal> Yes
[16:18] <jonnybal> Excuse my spelling I'm typing on a phone
[16:19] <nicofs> ActionParsnip, "clean"
[16:19] <ActionParsnip> Jonnybal: if you run:   ps -ef | grep -i guest     do you see processes
[16:19] <Pinkamena_D> If i wanted to make a webpage on my server that showed the hard drive space remaining, how hard would that be to do?
[16:20] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: if you mount the filesystem,  then run:  sync    then unmount/eject.  Is it oj?
[16:22] <dakotawulfy> nicofs not saying this is happing but some time if u close down the file manager and reopen it it might see them u could try that some time if u have it open before it stuck in does not read it the new files  have seen that
[16:23] <BluesKaj> !u
[16:23] <ubottu> U is the 21st letter of the modern latin alphabet. Neither 'U' nor 'Ur' are words in the English language. Neither are 'R', 'Y', 'l8', 'ryt',  'Ne1' nor 'Bcuz'. Mangled English is hard for non-native English speakers. Please see http://geekosophical.net/random/abbreviations/ for more information.
[16:23] <nicofs> ActionParsnip, this did the trick - but why?
[16:24] <bekks> ActionParsnip: Sorry for the late answer: Using a redirection may result in data corruption when something else is writing to the same stream.
[16:24] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: the copy wasn't synched fully. So what you saw on the file system was the cache
[16:24] <_helios_> ActionParsnip, I have a desktop with xubuntu but it only has ethernet no wireless.   I bought a USB adapter but waiting for it in the mail.  Do you know a way I can give internet from my laptop I'm using now to it?
[16:24] <ActionParsnip> Bekks: I wasn't advising any dd stuff though....
[16:25] <nicofs> ActionParsnip, so the issue is with the source pc that did not "finish" copying?
[16:25] <jonnybal> Actionparsnip: 120 21220 21167 0 14:49 ? 00:00:00 su guest-MTE7jY -c dpms force on
[16:25] <jonnybal> That's the first line. The second line relates to grep
[16:25] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: it had copied tobthe cache, just not transfered to the actual storage
[16:25] <bekks> ActionParsnip: I may have mistabbed, too :)
[16:26] <nicofs> ActionParsnip, how do I prevent that from happening in the future? oO
[16:26] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: it helps make floppy access faster too as you are working on the cache, not the floppy itself.  Same with slow USB
[16:27] <jonnybal> And I'm sorry for spamming but this irc app on my phone closes the connection if I don't say anything for a while
[16:27] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: try copying a new file
[16:28] <archerr> hi
[16:28] <sapro> hello again.
[16:28] <ActionParsnip> Jonnybal: killall -u guest-MTE7jY
[16:28] <kriestof> Hi, i want to install Win 7 on the PC, where I have currently installed Ubuntu. I have several partitions on the PC and there is one ready for Win 7, but he tells me he can't install system there.
[16:29] <nicofs> ActionParsnip, that's more of a workaround than a solution... but it'll do...
[16:29] <yashi> a
[16:29] <jonnybal> Please ignore this message. It's just so my irc app doesn't time out and close the connection. Sorry for the spam
[16:29] <sapro> ActionParsnip: i downloaded a new iso. i've used Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.2.2 to put the iso on usb. and again that error.
[16:30] <sapro> i've checked md5 sum
[16:30] <ActionParsnip> Nicofs: its showing how long I've used the OS, that's how it used to be. Not sure why its not doing it for you
[16:30] <atlef> !WindowsDualBoot
[16:30] <jonnybal> Actionparsnip: cannot find user guest
[16:30] <ActionParsnip> Sapro: have you tested the RAM using the memtest on tge live usb?
[16:30] <atlef> kriestof, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
[16:30] <escott> kriestof, win wont install to extended partitions
[16:31] <kriestof> damn
[16:31] <ActionParsnip> Jonnybal: run:   who     to see the logged in users
[16:31] <eristikophiles> so, i guess what i need to do is try out each setting on its own, then if those fail, combinations. each time rebooting and waiting to see if the bug comes back, and if so, rebooting and altering settings again
[16:32] <eristikophiles> but, i would appreciate a short list of which settings might apply.. like, ulimit, file-max, and then threads?
[16:32] <eristikophiles> where do you alter the threads by process limit?
[16:32] <Jonny1> ActionParsnip: Thanks. I put a space in that shouldnt have been there.   I did what you said and it shut down the guest session returning me to the login screen. I am now successfully back in my regular user account. I might disable the guest session if it's going to cause problems like that. That was scary
[16:32] <sapro> ActionParsnip: no.
[16:33] <sapro> do you think its the usb pen?
[16:33] <ActionParsnip> Sapro: the ram, not the usb storage
[16:34] <kriestof> escott: so I guess I have to modify my current extended partition and create another primary partiotion?
[16:34] <eristikophiles> huh. i found a post on the web about reconfiguring nautilus to not preview media files, that was one person's version of this bug a while ago. krusader just crashed
[16:34] <eristikophiles> i was going to alter prefs see if that was there too
[16:35] <sapro> i'll try memtest86+ 4.20
[16:35] <sapro> brb
[16:36] <eristikophiles> also like, this box is running its fan crazy like it's doing something background
[16:36] <eristikophiles> it might be virus scan or something too
[16:37] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: if your gpu is not used, your cpu will perform the 3D rendering
[16:38] <eristikophiles> there's no 3d right now. i mean, i don't use 3d in my gui setup
[16:38] <eristikophiles> or anything moving
[16:38] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: I bet if you use xfce or lxde, it will slow down a lit
[16:38] <eristikophiles> it just sits
[16:38] <eristikophiles> i'm running kde and it's made to look not-so-shiny
[16:39] <solidoodlesuppor> ActionParsnip: So, even with 3D Acceleration it wont load. Is there a way to get a terminal up from this state so I can grab xfce?
[16:39] <eristikophiles> oh that was for you.
[16:39] <eristikophiles> makes more sense now
[16:39] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: so if you run: ps -ef | grep compiz | grep -v grep       nothing is output?
[16:39] <eristikophiles> just the same error. "too many files open"
[16:39] <eristikophiles> pipe failed
[16:40] <atlef> eristikophiles, not that i know exactly what your problem is, but is this a laptop?
[16:40] <eristikophiles> even when doing 1 command with no pipes
[16:40] <eristikophiles> no it's an old refurb desktop
[16:40] <eristikophiles> hp compaq business box once
[16:40] <atlef> oh, ok
[16:40] <ActionParsnip> Solidoodlesuppor: press ctrl+alt+f1 and insrall rhe xfce4 psckage there
[16:40] <eristikophiles> i basically can't run anything after a while. random period after starting, it begins to refuse to run anything else not running. some programs just crash when used
[16:40] <julian-delphiki> hm, too many files open
[16:41] <eristikophiles> console crashed actually. i can't even type in useless commands anymore
[16:41] <julian-delphiki> man, it'd be nice if we could get a ps aux | wc -l
[16:41] <eristikophiles> i can't use ctrl-alt-f# consoles either
[16:41] <julian-delphiki> sounds like something that is forking repeatedly and opening files.
[16:42] <ActionParsnip> Eristikophiles: if you make a new user in root recovery mode, make a new user there,  is the OS ok there as the new user?
=== Guest69144 is now known as ryanclancy000
[16:42] <eristikophiles> i tried logging in, it just got to where it checks mail, said "system restart required"
[16:42] <julian-delphiki> i suppose, if you rebooted, you could change the nofiles setting in /etc/security/limits.conf
[16:42] <Lesnix> hi guys
[16:42] <julian-delphiki> hi lelamal
[16:42] <Lesnix> are there someone from US ?
[16:42] <julian-delphiki> Lesnix
[16:42] <eristikophiles> yeah i'm just trying to figure out which thing/s to change when i do reboot
[16:42] <eristikophiles> or i can just reboot and maybe it'll go away
[16:42] <eristikophiles> Lesnix- yes
[16:42] <ActionParsnip> Lesnix: this is support, location is moot
[16:43] <eristikophiles> true. offtopic is for that
[16:43] <atlef> eristikophiles, has anything like other live cds worked with it
[16:43] <doctorly> is there a nice python shell/interpreter for tty?
[16:43] <Lesnix> ok, let's forget about US. I have a generic question on ubuntu )
[16:43] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: yes, python
[16:43] <eristikophiles> i haven't tried that. it seems like something i'll have to fix sooner or later, yet can only diagnose when it's happening. so then, can't really diagnose it at all
[16:43] <ActionParsnip> Lesnix: then ask away
[16:44] <Lesnix> how to make ubuntu remember my key-binding "Super+L" ?
[16:44] <doctorly> python only lets you enter like one like at a time and it doesnt save your work
[16:44] <ActionParsnip> !shortcut
[16:44] <ubottu> Keyboard shortcuts can be set in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. If your multimedia keys don't work with that, try the 'keytouch' package, explained at http://keytouch.sourceforge.net/ - See !Keyboard for changing layouts. A list of keyboard shortcuts for Unity is available at http://ubottu.com/y/shortcuts
[16:44] <Lesnix> now I have assigned this for "Lock the screen" action, but ubuntu forget it eery time after reboot
[16:44] <eristik> ok well, i'll be here now
[16:44] <eristik> going to reboot that box
[16:44] <atlef> eristikophiles, if other distro's works, then you can rule some things out
[16:44] <eristik> wow mirc is so drab ;p
[16:45] <eristik> true
[16:45] <Lesnix> ubottu, i've done this via "Keyboard Shortcuts" already.
[16:45] <ubottu> Lesnix: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
[16:45] <Lesnix> =)
[16:45] <Lesnix> ok, got it
[16:45] <ActionParsnip> Doctorly: its a n interpreter,  which you asked for
[16:46] <doctorly> ActionPasrsnip: I asked for a shell/interpreter
[16:46] <doctorly> ActionPasrsnip: Thanks though
[16:46] <eristik> there we go. soon i'll be able to actually run commands! (amazing. i thought that was a given, since the late 90s)
[16:46] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: you can edit a python script in nano or vi, then run the script using python
[16:46] <eristik> before anything i need to check the virus scanner. it might just be that the scanner is going nuts. that would account for the fan
[16:47] <eristik> (other than the box just being old)
[16:47] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: python is the interpreter
[16:47] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: do you mean an IDE?
[16:48] <eristik> also, is there a way to turn off the darkstat daemon? can't remember where the files were / if i should just manually remove them
[16:48] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: an IDE is not an interpreter,  python is still doing the work, the IDE (cli or gui) just helps write code
[16:48] <doctorly> ActionPasrsnip: I know I can, that is just not what Im looking for. Like I said, it doesnt have the functionality that I want. I mean a shell/interpreter. A shell that works with the interpreter. I am convinced you dont actually know anything on the subject and just googled, which I had already done, and doesnt help.
[16:48] <julian-delphiki> eristik... virus scanner?
[16:49] <eristik> and, when booting i got a "last mount time for superblock is in the future" message on several partitions.. never seen that before
[16:49] <eristik> julian-delphiki yeah clamav
[16:49] <eristik> just in case
[16:49] <julian-delphiki> doctorly: i assure you that ActionParsnip does know what they're talking about -- your question is unclear.
[16:49] <escott> kriestof, yeah
[16:50] <dylan_> is anyone else having problems with unmounting?
[16:50] <doctorly> how is asking for a shell unclear? it is the most common way of interacting with python
[16:50] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: the shell can be told to use any interpreter,  the default is badh, but you can tell it to use python, perl or whatever you want
[16:50] <ActionParsnip> Docr
[16:50] <eristik> haha "date of your last known threat: 04 Nov 2011"
[16:50] <julian-delphiki> doctorly: when you type just "python" on the command line it gives you a python shell, and interpreter. If you want to save your work you need to use some form of a text editor.
[16:50] <escott> ActionParsnip, didn't know you were so opinionated about bash :-P
[16:50] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: I dont use Google.  Its poor imho
[16:50] <eristik> it just scanned yesterday it says. so, not that then. i didn't have the bug yesterday
[16:51] <julian-delphiki> dylan_: no. What problem are you having
[16:51] <doctorly> it is only an interpreter not a shell
[16:51] <doctorly> and you cant tell a shell to work with anything..
[16:51] <dylan_> cant unmount needs root access
[16:51] <doctorly> Im sorry for asking here, I am going to find a python chat or board instead
[16:51] <escott> dylan_, ok
[16:51] <julian-delphiki> dylan_: yes, you need to use sudo.
[16:51] <jrib> doctorly: python, ipython, bpython... try them and use what you like...
[16:52] <doctorly> what I am asking for is very clear though haha
[16:52] <julian-delphiki> doctorly: what exactly are you wanting to do with this python shell.
[16:52] <dylan_> how?
[16:52] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: the shell is flexible, so in saying "interpreter" you simply need to tell the shell to exoect python . Why do you think the top line of shell scriots is #!/bin/bash
[16:52] <julian-delphiki> dylan_: sudo unmount path.
[16:52] <doctorly> thanks for trying though!
[16:52] <julian-delphiki> wow
[16:52] <ActionParsnip> Doctoly: it tells the shell to use /bin/bash to interpret the code. Python has a different head lune
[16:53] <ActionParsnip> Line

[17:07] <shaka_> iceroot: Heh. Doesn't explain what "confines individual programs to a set of listed files and posix 1003.1e draft capabilities" means :D
[17:07] <iceroot> shaka_: then ask a detailed question :)
[17:08] <shaka_> What "confines individual programs to a set of listed files and posix 1003.1e draft capabilities" mean?
[17:08] <escott> shaka_, its an LSM. you profile an application (like apache) and if it starts messing with something it shouldn't (like trying to write to /etc or execute /bin/bash) you can stop it
[17:08] <iceroot> shaka_: http://wiki.apparmor.net/index.php/Main_Page
[17:08] <v1c3> ActionParsnip: not many. the server only qould be used for private purpose.
[17:08] <iceroot> shaka_: apparmor is creating security profiles for specific applications, so that they are only allowed to know specific things
[17:09] <eristik> ok so here are some numbers i get reported back: {cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max, cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max, ulimit} = {52065, 333187, unlimited}
[17:09] <iceroot> shaka_: and the common programs like firefox and so on, for that programs there are already configured profiles
[17:09] <modifier> IGMP should be enabled in router configuration ? and which option to choose - IGMP Standard Mode or Blocking Mode ??
[17:10] <eristik> also i should note i use zsh and i can't access the 'getrlimit' command. not sure if it's only for bash
[17:11] <shaka_> Do you use it? Like, is it a necessity? I've been using different GNU/Linux distros for almost ten years, including various *buntus and I've never used it.
[17:12] <escott> shaka_, it is a security tool
[17:12] <eristik> also ulimit -s = 8192
[17:12] <escott> shaka_, is it necessary to login as a non-root user? no the system would still work even if you didn't. is it a good idea? yes
[17:14] <eristik> well, i'm going to have a smoke, try to reconsider this stuff. i'm not running apps on the other box, to see if it's one of the bigger apps specifically doing this
[17:14] <shaka_> I understand that much. It's just... I feel like I've opened my self up to vulnerabilities just by running Ubuntu.
[17:14] <crystaltvcoby> playing around with ubuntu 12.04 on virtualbox to verify better than redhat.. liking.. but no middle mouse button scrolling in Firefox.. done the about:config changes any ideas?

[17:15] <modifier> should IGMP be enabled in router configuration ? and which option to choose - IGMP Standard Mode or Blocking Mode ??
[17:15] <escott> shaka_, then it would sound like you do want apparmor, and that you probably want to strengthen its config (i think by default it warns rather than kills the application)

[17:18] <SolarisBoy> modifier: #networking modifier leave it disabled if you have no idea is a good practice - it's for multicasting which is not required

[17:33] <harushimo> if I do that, can I use it for python4
[17:33] <harushimo> I mean python3
[17:33] <qwiksilver711> ActionParsnip: I aplogize for my ignorance here, but isnt the driver i got from nvidias website packaged? I'm quite new and the guy who was supposed to be helping me fell asleep

[17:33] <harushimo> I have 2.7 and 3.2 installed on my computer
[17:33] <CommunistJamie> Are you saying I shouldn't use the package manager?
[17:33] <zykotic10> CommunistJamie: oh, see ActionParsnip above.
[17:34] <CommunistJamie> Which sudo command do I need?
[17:34] <SolarisBoy> harushimo: that depends on the python-pygame plugin and if its supported by those 2 py versions

[17:34] <qwiksilver711> ActionParsnip: Thank you, I will try this immediately and come back with my next issue.
[17:34] <ActionParsnip> CommunistJamie: sudo apt-get --purge remove gnomine gnome-mahjong
[17:35] <CommunistJamie> I don't have that.
[17:35] <harushimo> another way is to download and do make install from the source
[17:35] <SolarisBoy> harushimo: ubuntu keeps 1.9.1 in the repo so you should be ok i guess
[17:35] <harushimo> okay cool
=== lap is now known as Guest80155
[17:35] <ActionParsnip> CommunistJamie: just remove the games using software centre and the folder will go
[17:35] <harushimo> thank you because I just tried to do a pip install and it didn't on ubuntu
[17:35] <harushimo> which I don't know why
[17:35] <CommunistJamie> I'm on lubuntu.
[17:36] <_helios_> ActionParsnip, thanks just got your link
[17:36] <CommunistJamie> I don't see the software center.
[17:36] <SolarisBoy> harushimo: it's best to install the language modules via the software center

[17:36] <SolarisBoy> harushimo: if they are not available via software then yoy can try to use the seperate language based package manager like pip or easy_install or gem (ruby)
[17:36] <SolarisBoy> but generally if your using the system installed version you should allow the system to manage those modules
[17:37] <qwiksilver711> ActionParsnip: ok that installed them, do I need to restart anything now?
[17:37] <harushimo> SolarisBoy: I did use pip but I heard easy_install isn't supported that much anymore

[17:39] <ActionParsnip> Crystaltvcoby: does the system have a make and model? If you are using a USB mouse etc, does it have a make and model??
[17:39] <k1l> Guest70719: depends on your hardware

[17:39] <Guest71295> if i change swap partition from logical to primary do i have to tell ubuntu i ve done that?
[17:39] <k1l> Guest70719: best way is to google for your exact hardware or look into the hcl.
[17:40] <NuSuey> ActionParsnip: but milions aren't so known :P
[17:40] <ActionParsnip> Sapro: what is the message when you boot the USB?

[17:40] <Guest70719> i mean function keys, thats FN (next to ctrl) and an F key.
[17:40] <NuSuey> ActionParsnip: dude, this here is currently soo.. offtopic -.^
[17:40] <ActionParsnip> Sapro: tried the mini ISO?
[17:41] <sapro> no.
[17:41] <Guest70719> and only a few things appear when I type lubuntu FN keys into google, those instructions dont work, i dobt anything would appear if i do lubuntu FN keys on sony pcg-v505cp
[17:41] <k1l> Guest70719: that is device specific. its a acpi
[17:41] <ActionParsnip> Guest70719: if you run: xev    do the shortcuts make different events to the keys pressed on thier own
[17:42] <sapro> i want to test. but i don't know from there should i download
[17:42] <ActionParsnip> Sapro: I suggest you try it

[17:42] <ubottu> Sapro: The Minimal CD image is very small in size, and it downloads most packages from the Internet during installation, allowing you to select only those you want (the installer is like the one on the !Alternate CD). See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD

[17:43] <sapro> thanks. i'll try
[17:43] <jpastore> I just upgraded to 12.10 and the backlight on the monitor no longer works. all of searches lead me to backlight control being weird increments or stuck on max. can someone point me in the right direction?
[17:44] <ActionParsnip> Guest71295: it will have a different UUUD which will need to be changed in fstab
[17:44] <Guest70719> what do i do with xev???
[17:44] <Guest71295> if i change swap partition from logical to primary do i have to tell ubuntu i ve done that?
[17:44] <ActionParsnip> Guest71295: eyes up. I meant UUID
[17:45] <Guest70719> xev brings up a window, when i move it it displays text showing what I do to it
[17:45] <escott> Guest71295, you have to mkswap and update the fstab
[17:45] <ActionParsnip> Guest70719:  press keys, note how it reacts. Press the key without and then with the Fn key held. Are different events made?
[17:46] <zykotic10> ActionParsnip: escott Guest71295 mkswap has a -L to label swap partitions - then you can use LABEL instead of the UUID non-sense
[17:47] <crystaltvcoby> my usb middle mouse button wont scroll in FF or libreoffice text doc's, tried all steps so far, even installed gpointing-device-settings.. anyone have ideas on where I should be looking?
[17:47] <storrgie> I've got an install where it is trying to put the grub parition on the USB disk... how can I manually specify the grub install?
[17:47] <Guest70719> yes, different events are made, the f5 and f6 work incorrectly, only with FN heald down
[17:48] <Guest70719> Presumably somewhere there are FN-key settings, that are by default set to FN+F5, and FN+F6, what i need to know is what settings file that is, or is there a program I use
[17:48] <ActionParsnip> Crystaltvcoby: if you answer my questions, I can advise. Why bother asking if you won't respond to questions for more details

[17:49] <ubottu> Guest70719: Keyboard shortcuts can be set in System -> Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts. If your multimedia keys don't work with that, try the 'keytouch' package, explained at http://keytouch.sourceforge.net/ - See !Keyboard for changing layouts. A list of keyboard shortcuts for Unity is available at http://ubottu.com/y/shortcuts
[17:49] <Guest70719> I use LXDE desktop enviroment
[17:50] <ActionParsnip> Guest70719: it still has a keyboard app in settings
[17:50] <crystaltvcoby> ActionParsnip: I did.. you asked if scroll works in other things, I said no but it seems I missed the make and model question..
[17:50] <crystaltvcoby> r/l intrudes.. bbl
[17:51] <ActionParsnip> Guest70719: fyi, the DE in LXDE stands for Desktop Environment.  So you don't need to ad it again,  its redundant
[17:51] <BeowulfB> Yo, I got a question
[17:51] <ActionParsnip> Crystaltvcoby: does the system have a make and model? Does the mouse have a make and model? If yoy scroll up you'd see that
[17:52] <Guest70719> I cant find that option, it does not seem to work
[17:52] <julian-delphiki> BeowulfB: awk away
[17:52] <BeowulfB> So I want to instal ubuntu on an Asus 900
[17:52] <ActionParsnip> Guest70719: i'd ask in #lxde too
[17:52] <BeowulfB> The specs sheet says 512mb ram windows
[17:52] <BeowulfB> and 1Gb linux
[17:52] <BeowulfB> Which is it?!
[17:52] <ActionParsnip> Beowulf: lubuntu is light
[17:53] <BeowulfB> Is it just standard ubuntu with the LXDE?
[17:53] <ActionParsnip> Beowulf: you may have onboard video takinf
[17:53] <ActionParsnip> Raking 512mb
[17:53] <ActionParsnip> Beowulf: yes, just replaces gnome and compiz with kxde and openbox
[17:54] <ActionParsnip> Lxde not kxde
[17:54] <BeowulfB> That's a shame, I actually like Gnome
[17:54] <BeowulfB> would it be able to run on 512mb ram?
[17:55] <BeowulfB> Like, if I set it to the 2D setting
[17:55] <ActionParsnip> Beowulf: you can run gnome apps as you wish
[17:55] <BeowulfB> Cos If it's too much, I could go with plan Puppy lol
[17:55] <ActionParsnip> Beowulf: you could run Precise Ubuntu and use Unity2D
[17:56] <ActionParsnip> Beowulf: plenty of light distributions aroundm slitaz, tinycore etc
[17:56] <BeowulfB> Well that's my other question
[17:56] <BeowulfB> Puppy mentioned ubuntu compatibility
[17:56] <BeowulfB> Can I use ubuntu compiled packages with it?
[17:56] <julian-delphiki> BeowulfB: you can give it a try, it'll likely work.

[18:18] <Tuxmascot> After about 3-5 reboots lol
[18:18] <yeats> *sometimes
[18:18] <arshavin> virtualbox debian screen resolution problem,installed guest additions but resolutions shown are far higher than that supported by my lapto
[18:18] <ActionParsnip> Tuxmascot: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/how-to-easily-mount-the-galaxy-nexus-on-ubuntu-11-10-via-unity
[18:19] <Tuxmascot> Thanks ActionParsnip!
[18:19] <arshavin> also seamless option is greyed out
[18:19] <Tuxmascot> Play some TF2 now lol
[18:19] <Tuxmascot> bye
[18:19] <ActionParsnip> Arshavin: then ask in #debian
[18:19] <zvacet> CanonPrinter: just entered link you gave and that is what i found maybe it will better to just ask here
[18:19] <BluesKaj> lol? what's funny?
[18:19] <CanonPrinter> zvacet: thanks again, i'll try this, and if not work, i'll be back
[18:19] <yeats> Tuxmascot: ok - then go to Software Sources and click on the Additional Drivers tab, then select the nvidia driver you want
[18:20] <arshavin> i think its a virtualbox problem
[18:20] <BluesKaj> another lol, crazed user
[18:20] <zvacet> CanonPrinter: np  :)
[18:20] <apn> iceroot, android is not officially supported by anything, and it would be an oxymoron if it was.  But Samsung Galaxy is.
[18:20] <yeats> er..
[18:21] <iceroot> apn: all systems which are using standard protocols for file-access and co are working fine with it but no os is officially supported (for what should it be supported)
[18:21] <ActionParsnip> Arshavin: then ask in #vbox
[18:22] <apn> iceroot, please refer to Samsung Galaxy manual.
[18:22] <iceroot> apn: i dont need a manual, i dont own such a phone
[18:22] <arshavin> ActionParsnip:ok thanks
[18:22] <apn> iceroot, case's closed.
[18:22] <iceroot> apn: strange guy but ok
[18:23] <ActionParsnip> Canonprinter: did you check the link I gave
[18:23] <utopiq> ActionParsnip k1l ioria forgive me, I did silly mistake, I was checking the info on my PC and not in my laptop, that's why it appeared Oniric instead of QQ. I tried the ioria solution but it's not working
[18:24] <ioria> utopiq:  did you restarted ?
[18:24] <ActionParsnip> Utopiq: can you ping 8.8.8.8?
[18:25] <utopiq> ioria, yes, the full system
[18:25] <ioria> utopiq:  how the file interfaces looks like ?
[18:26] <sylphie> would many things fail if the java runtime was deleted?
[18:26] <utopiq> ActionParsnip no, I can't I'm trying to configure the internet connection
[18:26] <ActionParsnip> Utopiq: if you run:  echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf      do you get web access?
[18:26] <utopiq> ioria exactly like you said,
[18:26] <BluesKaj> sylphie, dunno , not many ppl delete it
[18:26] <cha0xm1nd_> ActionParsnip, lshw -c displays unclaimed
[18:26] <apn> sylphie, no, only apps that rely on java.
[18:27] <ioria> utopiq:  ifconfig ?
[18:27] <ActionParsnip> Cha0xm1nd: but only the nvidia gpu, nothing else?
[18:27] <sylphie> ok. I saw a thing on the news last night where the DHS is advising everyone to get rid of their java
[18:27] <jpastore> I just upgraded to 12.10 and the backlight on the monitor gets disabled during the boot process. any ideas?
[18:28] <ActionParsnip> Utopiq: can you ping the routers internal ip?
[18:28] <utopiq> ActionParsnip, no I don't get network access
[18:28] <utopiq> the problem is my router don't uses DHCP
[18:28] <ActionParsnip> Jpastore: what make and model system?
[18:28] <cha0xm1nd_> ActionParsnip, VGA compatible controller with nvidia as product and vendor
[18:28] <utopiq> I need to configure not to use DHCP but the grafic util has the Apply button disabled when I choose manual insted of DHCP
[18:29] <apn> sylphie, well, you shouldn't have any problems afterwards, as nothing system essential is using it.  Many commercial java apps come with their own runtime packaged
[18:29] <ActionParsnip> Cha0xm1nd: try:  sudo nvidia-xconfig    then reboot
[18:29] <utopiq> I'm trying to connect via WIFI
[18:29] <ActionParsnip> Utopiq: is the system a laptop?
[18:29] <ioria> utopiq:  my file was for eth0 ... ??????
[18:29] <jpastore> ActionParsnip, asus eee pc
[18:30] <ioria> utopiq:  not for wifi
[18:30] <utopiq> ioria ifconfig shows eth0 ..... lo ..... wlan0
[18:30] <apn> utopiq, that means that you are missing some information. Do you have dns configured as well? What about mask?
[18:30] <Mobil> Hi, I have slow transfer rate between my xfs filesystem and ntfs USB. Accessing the XFS system from my windows machine over the network nets me full speed, where as with my USB I'm getting 4.5 MB/s . Can I fix this?
[18:30] <ioria> utopiq:  use wlan0 not eth0 in interfaces
[18:30] <ActionParsnip> Jpastore: which one, there are lots of eee pcs
[18:30] <utopiq> ioria, ok thanks, I'll do it
[18:31] <jpastore> ActionParsnip, yea I was looking for a model number. I don't see one...even looked under battery...how can I better answer this?
[18:31] <ActionParsnip> Utopiq: is the system va laptop?
[18:31] <sylphie> Mobil \ the ntfs-3g driver is naturally slow, and being on usb makes that worse

[18:34] <ioria> utopiq:  anyone can access you router ...elsewhere
[18:34] <Mobil> sylphie: I have a centOS machine at work and it copies files fast to USB. Moreover, my windows drive has no problem accepting files and copying them at 80+MB/s, it is infact much faster for me to copy over the network to my USB (from linux box to usb attached to win box). Now I don't have USB 3.0 on windows box but I have USB3.0 on linux box, and that's why I want to transfer stuff on linux box itself
[18:34] <ActionParsnip> Jpastore: run :    sudo set pci -s 00:02.0 F4.B=75
[18:34] <utopiq> ioria, yes but I don't want to change the router configuration, just configure the laptop to use static ip insted DHCP
[18:34] <Guest61902> is ubuntu better than windows 7
[18:34] <ActionParsnip> Guest61902: depends
[18:35] <xmlnewbi> if i was trying to ssh into a vmware ubuntu server. What ip address would I use? I tried my own but im getting a connection refused
[18:35] <jpastore> ActionParsnip, set command not found
[18:35] <Mobil> Guest61902: not if you want to copy files to your external drive apparently :/
[18:35] <ActionParsnip> Xmlnewbi: the ip of the guest
[18:36] <utopiq> ioria bad luck, I still have no connection on the laptop, even editing interfaces to use static IP for the wlan0 interface
[18:36] <xmlnewbi> there a command line to return that?

[18:36] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, could you help me out ? what version are you running of ubuntu?
[18:37] <jpastore> ActionParsnip, so it was setpci  not 'set pci' awesome...how would I have figured that out. where did you look that up? is this permanent?
[18:37] <yeats> xmlnewbi: you'd need to get access to the virtual console via vmware and login there
[18:37] <harushimo> so when is the ubuntu phone OS coming out?
[18:37] <harushimo> I'm just curious
[18:37] <ioria> utopiq:  but with dhcp you can access internet ?
[18:37] <jpastore> ActionParsnip, btw, you are a machine. thanks for being so helpful

[18:38] <ActionParsnip> Jpastore: you could put the command in /etc/rc.local   above the exit 0 libeband it will run each boot
[18:38] <sylphie> Mobil \ so you are saying your linux box with slow usb-drive transfers is usb 3.0? Because I have heard of other others reporting that their usb 3.0 drives work very slowly from linux, as compared to usb 2.0 on the same machiones, so it might be a driver issue?
[18:38] <utopiq> in fact, the only problem is a button that appears disabled, just enabling that button...

[18:41] <Mobil> sylphie, ActionParsnip:  I tried USB 3.0 and 2.0 ..They get around the same speed (~4.5MB/s) . Someone told me it's a kernel issue. Another weird thing is that doing a copy through terminal is actually faster than doing it through gui ..I get 7-8 MB/second

[18:44] <cha0xm1nd_> ActionParsnip, nvidia-xconfig didnt change a thing
[18:44] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, I use the box as a NAS/HTPC, which is why I really need USB support
[18:45] <sybariten> dear ubuntuers
[18:45] <sybariten> you prolly get this all the time, but whats the best way to determine if my commie is 32 or 64 bit?
[18:45] <sybariten> I honestly dont know and i dont have the HD with Win in it now, so i cant check there... but it ran Win7 ...
[18:45] <Mobil> sylphie, is there a way to change the drivers?
[18:46] <zykotic10> sybariten: the OS or the physical cpu?
[18:46] <sybariten> THe ubuntu DL page says that if its newer than 2010, i prolly want 64bit ... and it is newer than 2010.
[18:46] <sybariten> zykotic10: eh. Thats a good question. So theres a difference.
=== JJ55jo is now known as jon654
[18:46] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: what filesystem is the usb?
[18:46] <sybariten> This is a very plain vanilla compaq laptop
[18:46] <jon654> Hello, I'm trying to install ubuntu on a tablet, Does anyone know how to boot android device from the sd card slot
[18:47] <zykotic10> sybariten: yes, you can install 32bit OS on AMD64 cpu...
=== ericab_away is now known as ericab
[18:47] <sybariten> zykotic10: hang on i gotta google for a sec
[18:47] <jazzkutya> sybariten: how much ram do you have?
[18:47] <ActionParsnip> Sybariten: does the system have a make and model?
[18:47] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, ntfs. Can I use maybe a different version of ntfs 3g drivers?
[18:47] <sylphie> Mobil \ you could upgrade your kernel, I suppose
[18:47] <BluesKaj> sybariten, look at the cpu logo on your laptop
[18:47] <apn> sybariten, "uname -m"
[18:48] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: sharing NTFS in Ubuntu isn't an easy task. Considered formatting it to Ext4?
[18:48] <sybariten> jazzkutya: 2 gigabytes i reckon
[18:48] <Mobil> sylphie: how would I go about doing that? or maybe even downgrade to 2.6.xx (like centOS) while keeping ubuntu 12.10? is that even possible.
[18:48] <jazzkutya> sybariten: then i would recomment installing 32bit anyway
[18:48] <jazzkutya> recommend
[18:49] <sybariten> ActionParsnip: yeah, its a compaq cq57 ... appearently the CPU is amd Brazos E300....
[18:49] <sylphie> Mobil \ you could also go to the ntfs-3d site and see if they have any updates or fixes
[18:49] <jon654> Hello, I'm trying to install ubuntu on a tablet, Does anyone know how to boot android device from the sd card slot
[18:49] <rushy> can someone please help me with the installation of ubuntu server 12.10 (no info on hard drives completely new system)
[18:49] <ActionParsnip> Sybariten: then its 64bit
[18:49] <BluesKaj> nweret han 2010 and only 2G ram ...must be older or a netbook
[18:49] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, I'd love to format it to Ext4 just to test it out and see, but I have a lot of data and my externals are always attached to a windows box
[18:49] <biggi_mat> rushy, what exactly would be the problem
[18:49] <sybariten> jazzkutya: ok, why is that?
[18:49] <sylphie> Mobil \ you can't downgrade, only reinstall with the lower version
[18:50] <ActionParsnip> Mobil;: you can restore you data from backup
[18:50] <k1l> jon654: if its not a nexus7 android devices are not officically supported
[18:50] <sybariten> ActionParsnip: how does one determine these things easiest?
[18:50] <zykotic10> apn: fyi "uname -m" shows the kernel's bitness, but you can also run a 64bit kernel on a 32bit userland.  a better test of the OS's bitness, is to use "dpkg --print-architecture"
[18:50] <rushy> biggi_mat i've install and reinstalled like 20 times already
[18:50] <biggi_mat> Aaaand?
[18:50] <jazzkutya> sybariten: actualy even ubuntu does not recommend a 64 bit system if not neccessary (afaik), it's only the communiti site that recommends it
[18:50] <k1l> jon654: so try to ask in #ubuntu-arm or see in the rom-community from the device itselv
[18:50] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, I will try making a partition in my external and make that ext4 and see if there's a difference in speed
[18:50] <ActionParsnip> Sybariten: use the web to find out cpu specs
[18:50] <jon654> k1l: how could i root it?
[18:50] <rushy> biggi_mat: now this time its installed it won't show grub
[18:50] <jazzkutya> sybariten: and for 2-4g ram 64bit is not neccessary
[18:50] <rushy> biggi_mat: i've held shift down and nothing
[18:51] <k1l> jon654: that is not ubuntu support related. try xda-developers
[18:51] <sybariten> jazzkutya: i see
[18:51] <biggi_mat> I have no clue what the problem is, rushy. When you turn on the computer nothing happens?
[18:51] <sylphie> Mobil \ fat32 runs reasonable quick and would be seen from both linux and windows
[18:51] <apn> zykotic10, the kernel makes it the system. 64 bit kernel makes it the system, regardless of what kind of apps you wish to run.
[18:51] <zykotic10> apn: i see, i lost you ;)
[18:51] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: I suspect there is. Its a native linux OS. NTFS is proprietary to Microsoft.  If it is to sit on the server all the time, why use NTFS
[18:52] <rushy> biggi_mat: no it will go through the bios, but after that if i hold shift down it will say grub loading then screen go black and nothing after
[18:52] <Mobil> sylphie, ActionParsnip:  I have data that is usually much larger than 4.7GB in 1 file.
[18:52] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: why even use USB, its so slow
[18:52] <rushy> biggi_mat: if i go to install it all over again i get different errors depending on what i choose to do
[18:53] <biggi_mat> rushy, that's just megawierd and I wouldn't have a remote clue what is wrong really
[18:53] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: the largest file for ext4 is 4Tb
[18:53] <rushy> biggi_mat: if i install all server components i'll get a different error each time
[18:53] <jazzkutya> sybariten: another thing that may need a 64bit linux is hard disk bigger than 2Tbyte but i'm not sure about this
[18:53] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, good questions :). I have to use it for work, and instead of carrying an actual hard drive with me, I carry an external
[18:53] <sybariten> ActionParsnip: ok... interestingly enough the machine didnt have stickers that defines the cpu very well. It has a win7 sticker and two amd stickers but they just say "vision" and "dual core"....
[18:53] <rushy> biggi_mat: biggest thing i can only think of is how my raid5 is being set up. if someone can maybe walk me through it that would be great
[18:54] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: does work have web access?
[18:54] <sybariten> jazzkutya: ok no, i'm definitely below that. The reason i cant boot into win and see some HW info there, is that i just inserted a 30gb SSD....
[18:54] <julian-delphiki> lol, 30gb is a bit small to get much usage out of, don't you think?
[18:54] <sybariten> OK but so i take it, i wont have any tremendous benefits from running 64 bit ubuntu then...
[18:54] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, very much so, but we don't use the cloud, and where I live, internet usage costs money (Canada)
[18:54] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: install openssh-server and you will get an sftp server, you can access the dara securely over the web connection
[18:55] <sybariten> julian-delphiki: it'll be fine. An OS should occupy more than a couple of gigs, and then i'm not planning to turn this one into scene warez ftp server or antyhhing
[18:55] <ActionParsnip> Data*
[18:55] <BluesKaj> Mobil, Rogers or Bell ?
[18:55] <cha0xm1nd_> does anyone know how to get a geforce card working on ubuntu 12.10???
[18:55] <jazzkutya> sybariten: be warned that some other os i don't want to mention by name can take up 2/3 of that 30g :)
[18:55] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: thats why I don't use USB drives ;)
[18:55] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, I'm aware of that option, but again we only have about 100 GB of data usage (evne for business), so it's sometimes bs
[18:55] <zykotic10> BluesKaj: it's weird seeing Canadian specific stuff in #ubuntu ;)
[18:56] <pankaj> hy.........
[18:56] <Mobil> BluesKaj, That would be Robbers for work
[18:56] <sylphie> Mobil \ I don't think there are any reliable ext4 drivers for windows, but It *might* be possible to find JFS or XFS windows drivers, and those are reasonably quick
[18:56] <sybariten> jazzkutya: hm, i dont think its that bad actually... but well, i normally tend to run XP and that can be quite slim. This one originally had Win7 though
[18:56] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: yikes thats limited. Makes sense for USB then
[18:56] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, I'm glad you understand now :D
[18:56] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: make sure the other side can use ext4
[18:56] <jazzkutya> sybariten: yup xp is better for that
[18:57] <BluesKaj> zykotic10, Mobil , I'm a bell user and i got therm to pump my monthly cap to 105G with no rate increase ..fits my needs
[18:57] <Mobil> sylphie, I've looked to see if there's Ext4 support. there isnt. the most I found was ext2 support for windows..and it's a nightmare to work with.
[18:58] <Mobil> BluesKaj, I have 300GB for myself (Teksavvy - lookemup :D) but at work we need a business solution and it's crap.
[18:58] <ActionParsnip> Mobil: my comoany replicates about 3tb from leeds to london once an hour
[18:59] <BluesKaj> Mobil, accessing windows files is simple from linux , the reverse is not so easy
[18:59] <Mobil> ActionParsnip, ...............Are you hiring? :P
[18:59] <sybariten> but just to clear some things up then... then trying to get some flavour of ubuntu from a mirror earlier today (which is always a bit of a jungle), i noticed all 64bit labelled versions had amd in the name. So is 64 bit somehow always related to amd processors? Arent there 64 bit intel processors?

[19:51] <m3pow> hello everyone !
[19:51] <m3pow> just ran a hdparm and i get a suspicious low speed in diskreads
[19:51] <m3pow> 184MB in 3.02 sec = 60.90 MB/sec
[19:52] <sylphie> m3pow \ what are the specs for your drive?
[19:52] <m3pow> also the disk access in folders and everything is incredibly slow.10 ~ 15 sec to open a folder
[19:52] <auska> Hi! Does anyone know how can I take a picture from my webcam from the command line?
[19:52] <m3pow> a SATA 2 250GB hdd
[19:52] <m3pow> i'm currently running on an HP HDX 18
[19:52] <benwalburn> ok, I switched to console mode and it asked me to log in. I typed my name and password, but it just went back to asking for my name
[19:53] <sylphie> m3pow \ I  mean what are the real specs for it's reading bits from the platter
[19:53] <usr13> benwalburn: Type in user name, hit enter, type in pwd, hit enter again.
[19:54] <sylphie> m3pow \ I've got one drive simliar to yours, and for it 60mb/sec is average for a long sustained read/write
[19:54] <benwalburn> it says that cache write through failed
[19:55] <shell_> Is it possible to selectively ssh through open tcp ports?
[19:55] <benwalburn> actually, "asking for cache data failed"
[19:55] <yeats> shell_: do you mean "is it possible to configure sshd to listen on an alternate port?" if so, yes
[19:55] <m3pow> sylphie. when i had 12.04 installed everything was good in terms of accessing disk and files
[19:56] <benwalburn> and putting my name "ben" then enter, then my password and enter causes it to ask for my name again
[19:56] <Mobil> sylphie, I just did a test..I partitioned the drive into Fat32 and XFS ( I couldnt do JFS - I get this Creation of file system type jfs is not supported (udisks-error-quark, 11))..Fat32 gave me about 30MB/s .. XFS gave me 40MB/s write
[19:56] <shell_> yeats, well kind of. I can't access the default ssh port, so can I use alternatives?
[19:56] <sybariten> soooo... i DLed an iso image, the most "common" one i'd say. I installed it (?? burned it?) onto a 2gb usb memory using unetbootin. Now, whenever i try to boot it on my laptop, i get into busybox,....
[19:56] <usr13> benwalburn: You can't get logged in?  Did you forget your password?
[19:56] <sylphie> Mobil \ xfs is good, if you can find a windows app for it
[19:57] <sybariten> i do see a unetbootin boot splash screen first, so there is something on the usb memory no doubt
[19:57] <yeats> shell_: only if the server is listening on the other ports
[19:57] <benwalburn> no, I know my password, it just acts like I didn't enter it
[19:57] <Mobil> sylphie, whoever is doing ntfs-3g drivers needs to realize that 4MB/s is retarded
[19:57] <sybariten> but it doesnt go into ubuntu.... should i try making the usb memory again? Is thre something else than unetbootin, on Win?
[19:57] <sylphie> Mobil
[19:57] <usr13> benwalburn: You DO know that UserNames are case sensative, right?
[19:57] <Mobil> sylphie, Do you know how I can format to JFS?
[19:57] <benwalburn> when I type it in, a bunch of lines scoll down, but I can't read them, then it returns to asking for my user name
[19:58] <shell_> yeats, is there another network protocol I can use for remaining OPEN TCP PORTS?
[19:58] <sylphie> \ if you were forced to used fat32, you could break up files larger than 2gb into multiple parts
[19:58] <ls612> Are the Hyper-v drivers included by default in Ubuntu 12.10 desktop? I ask because 12.10 runs slow as heck under Client Hyper V and 12.04 runs much better.
[19:58] <usr13> benwalburn: user name?  What exactly does it say?
[19:58] <benwalburn> and, yes, I know it's case sensitive.
[19:58] <ioria> benwalburn: there are no error messages ?
[19:58] <yeats> shell_: what are you trying to do?
[19:58] <benwalburn> ubuntubox login:
[19:59] <sylphie> Mobil \ if you were forced to used fat32, you could break up files larger than 2gb into multiple parts
[19:59] <m3pow> sylphie any thoughts on this change from 12.04 to 12.10 ?
[19:59] <shell_> yeats, I would like to do some offsite system administration.
[19:59] <yeats> shell_: and why isn't ssh working as-is?
[19:59] <usr13> benwalburn: Ok.  Well that is normal.  Not sure what is going on, but you might try booting to text mode.
[19:59] <sylphie> Mobil \ I've formated JFS, but only to my main drive, at the moment my usb drive is broken
[20:00] <shell_> The server I set up, seems to still have the default port closed. Is there another route of entry that doesn't require my physical presence? yeats
[20:00] <Mobil> sylphie, ya I know, I'll just have to live with it for the time. It's funny cuz I've heard Fat32 on PS3 systems can handle files greater than 4.3 GB ..I have no idea how...
[20:00] <sylphie> m3pow \ another problem in 12.10's long list
[20:00] <m3pow> so a bug eh ?
[20:01] <sylphie> yeah, one of many
[20:01] <m3pow> hopefully 13.04 will solve this issue
[20:01] <sylphie> probably will, but introduce new ones
[20:01] <m3pow> thanks for your help, appreciate it
[20:01] <yeats> shell_: only if you set it up, I'm afraid - some servers have remote administration tools built-in (e.g. HP has iLO which you can configure to use a TTY)
[20:01] <yeats> shell_: but you have to set those up (if they are present in the first place)
[20:02] <blues_> i need a recommendation on torrent client for a headless server.  Used transmission on my old centos box but dunno if thats still the best bet
[20:03] <shell_> No no, I'm not using an actual server... I've just install putty for windows and it doesn't seem to be working. yeats
[20:03] <sylphie> Mobil \ XFS is open-source, so if you were a programming wiz you might be able to port it to windows
[20:03] <benwalburn-andro> Alright, how do I boot to text mode?
[20:03] <kunji> Mobil: I don't think the PS3 uses Fat32: http://psx-scene.com/forums/f177/what-format-ps3-file-system-77921/
[20:03] <yeats> shell_: okay - so do you have physical access to the server?

[20:04] <Mobil> sylphie, ha!
[20:04] <sylphie> Mobil \ at least your test proved it was the fault of ntfs-3g
[20:04] <usr13> benwalburn-andro: As MonkeyDust points out (I stand corrected).
[20:05] <kunji> Mobil: it reads external devices using FAT32, but that has the ~4 gig limitation.
[20:06] <Mobil> sylphie, yeap..
[20:06] <sylphie> Mobil \ I get the impression that ntfs-3g doesn't have much of a future, because technically ntfs is microsfoft's intellectual property
[20:06] <Mobil> kunji, I think you're right
[20:07] <bob__> just read in paper homeland security saying something about java threat even in linux any truth to this?
[20:07] <Mobil> sylphie, where did you find that shareware JFS filesystem support for windows (I got the impression that you did a seach)
[20:08] <sylphie> Mobil \ I did do a seach, but later when I went to investigate further the "shareware" was crippled-ware of expensive packages

[20:08] <Mobil> sylphie, I see..that's ok. I'll look at the ntfs3g site and see if there's anything I can pull from there
[20:08] <sylphie> Mobil \ so I'd have to retract my JFS suggestion
[20:09] <Mobil> sylphie, otherwise I'll stick to FAT32 and split files. I couldn't format to JFS anyways so it's ok :D

[20:11] <sylphie> Mobil \ I just had another idea, and it checks out- HFS (mac filesystem) is definitely supported by linux and windows
[20:11] <julian-delphiki> sylphie: using for pay software on windows,
[20:11] <julian-delphiki> pretty sure
[20:12] <sylphie> Mobil \ yeah, nothing is free on windows
[20:12] <Mobil> kunji, I read that it's actually fat32 but modified version of it (which is why you can push files larger than 4GB) . The XMB though is an unknown format
[20:13] <Mobil> sylphie, that's a great idea. i'll check it out asap :D
[20:13] <sylphie> Mobil \ I don't don't know what kind of HFS speeds you'd get though, might be worse than ntfs
[20:13] <kunji> Mobil: I'm reading up on it a bit more right now, there also is a fair amount of speculation that it may be a modified version of UDF
[20:14] <Mobil> kunji, Honstly, not sure what they are doing, but I've actually done it. I've pushed a 8GB file on there and everything (from the FTP to the ps3) said that it's a FAT32 ..so I have no clue.. The XMB is only accessable by the hypervisor and it's very much so encrypted
[20:15] <Mobil> sylphie, I'll try it out right now...let's hope I can format to HFS

[20:18] <kunji> Mobil: Hmm, I found a post saying that Sony got a license for JFS from IBM, with 256 bit DES, and modifications for database indexing for media and faster XMB loading.  Which would make sense, considering how closely they worked with IBM on the PS3.  Hmm, do idea how reliable that info is though.
[20:18] <kunji> Err, AES that is
[20:19] <shell_> very well... I guess i'll just have to wait till later then.
[20:19] <zykotic10> _Rocky_: 1) i believe it's terminus, not terminux.  2) i doubt you can use TTF style fonts on the terminal.

[20:28] <iko1> when is next version of ubutnu gonna come?
[20:28] <MonkeyDust> iko1  april
[20:29] <iko1> nice
[20:29] <julian-delphiki> iko1: april, 13.04
[20:29] <yeats> !isitout
[20:29] <ubottu> Yup!  https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2012-October/000164.html !party in #ubuntu-release-party
[20:29] <yeats> heh
[20:29] <MonkeyDust> MoL0ToV  technically, it's for this channel, but the people in #ubuntu-studio may know best
[20:29] <idefix> MonkeyDust I don't think glipper can do it
[20:29] <sylphie> MoL0ToV \ you could probably find the .wav file that's being played. much more accurate than recording the the resulting audio
[20:30] <MoL0ToV> sylphie, no, i have a app that generate audio
[20:31] <odigity> question about dash and lenses -- I like all the cool search lenses (like github and wikipedia), but I want to control if/when dash initiates an online search.  is there a way to limit that to only when I explicitly click on that lense's icon at the bottom of the dash overlay?
[20:32] <sylphie> MoL0ToV \ in that case, use your favorite audio recirder app to be recording at the same time as the sound is being played. though that depends on your sound card allowing that
[20:32] <odigity> I tried searching for it, but the results are full of noise about the amazon shopping lense, rather than general config info
[20:32] <Mobil> sylphie, any idea how to format a partition to hfsplus?
[20:32] <sergio_br2> hello
[20:32] <odigity> hello
[20:33] <sergio_br2> how can i report a bug in launchpad, without "ubuntu-bug" command ?
[20:33] <sylphie> mobile \ in the man for hfsutils, it mentions "hformat"
[20:33] <BluesKaj> best to just find out where th system sounds are stored and copy them to another file

[20:41] <Coded1> Thor:  you can have 2 vlans and 2 GWs
[20:41] <Coded1> Thor: depends on what your need for routing is
[20:41] <Thor> Coded1: I want that all my machines on an internal network should have 2 paths to the internet should 1 be down

=== gabriele is now known as Guest93083
[20:48] <diablo> Hello i,m new user i wanna to learn about Linux what is the best book to read ?
[20:48] <Speedy> sylphie:  Thanks.  It is for a class I am taking.  I am completelt new to LInux and I am not lloking for anyone to do my work for me, but I am in need of help.  Here is waht I need to do....
[20:49] <Speedy> Sylphie:  You have received 3 log files capturing the connection times and
[20:49] <Speedy> disconnect times for wireless clients in a public facility. Administration wants to
[20:49] <Speedy> determine usage for the wireless equipment.
[20:49] <ioria> diablo: www.tldp.org
[20:50] <Speedy> In order for the information in the log files to be meaningful you are required to
[20:50] <Speedy> combine the 3 months of data and filter it based on the following criteria. The
[20:50] <Speedy> following requirements need to be performed without creating any additional
[20:50] <Speedy> files other than the final results file using redirection and pipes and the
[20:50] <Speedy> appropriate commands to complete the task.
[20:50] <FloodBot1> Speedy: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[20:50] <Speedy> ok, sorry, am new to this......
[20:51] <julian-delphiki> Speedy: you shouldn't use other people for your homework help
[20:51] <Speedy> I've already stated I am lookign for help, not answers
[20:52] <julian-delphiki> Speedy: this is a support channel for ubuntu, not #bash101
[20:52] <sylphie> Speedy \ for redirection "appname < file1" would have the app take input from file1, "appname > file2" would produce output into file2, and "appname1 | appname2" would pipe the output of app1 into app2
[20:53] <Mobil> ha. Don't use enter as punctuation...I like that
=== jack is now known as Guest65039
[20:54] <Mobil> sylphie, ok so I downloaded gparted and I just formated the partition to hfsplus  the gui way..it's much faster than ntfs...the problem is with the ntfs support for sure. Thanks for all your help
[20:54] <sylphie> Mobil  \ good. glad I could help suggest it
[20:55] <sylphie> Mobil  \ I know there is windows software to deal with HFS, and it can take large files
[20:56] <Speedy> sylphie:  Thank you.  To filter my results is the "grep" command the preferred method?
[20:56] <Mobil> sylphie, yep. I looked into that. I think i'll be going in that direction from now on.
[20:56] <sylphie> Speedy \ your instructor might prefer grep. what they prefer is what to do
[20:57] <Speedy> sylphie:  ok
[20:57] <ClientAlive> I'm trying to find out which wireless chipset has higher performance and reliability - broadcom or ralink?
[20:57] <ClientAlive> any thoughts?
[20:58] <sylphie> flip a coin?
[20:58] <Bizzeh> hi, why can i not see a list of mirrors on the ubuntu website anymore? ubuntu's automatic detection on which mirror i should use is terrible and always sends me to one in the middle of nowhere, instead of any of the 3 in my country, or the one that is actually faster in ireland
[20:59] <MonkeyDust> !mirror | Bizzeh
[20:59] <ubottu> Bizzeh: Ubuntu installation CDs can be downloaded from http://releases.ubuntu.com - Mirrors can be found at http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Mirrors - PLEASE use the !torrents to download !Quantal, and help keeping the servers' load low!
[20:59] <Thor> ClientAlive: I haven't notice much difference between the two. I think performance-wise it's more to do the level of shitty ness on the AP and quality of the signal than the chip in your machine.
[20:59] <sylphie> Mobil \ plus now you can read/write the drive from any macs you might meet
[20:59] <Speedy> Sylphie:  I want to run ubuntu 12.04 server on my laptop to do my homework, I downloaded the .iso and want to run it from a USB thumb drive.  Is there a resource I need to read or is it more simple than that?
[20:59] <julian-delphiki> Bizzeh: https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors
[20:59] <sergio_br2> why https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+filebug doesn't work?
[21:00] <Mobil> sylphie, ya you're right. I'm starting to meet them a lot more often
[21:00] <julian-delphiki> Speedy: you should run it in a VM
[21:01] <moes>  Using startup disk creator from Ubuntu-12.04.1 on a 16 gb flash drive...fats 32 only allows 4.3 gb persistence...How can I increase to 8 gb ?
[21:01] <Speedy> julian-delphiki:  I do run it in a VM at school.   I use VMware and IU have a student copy at home but the resources on my desktop are very limited and it doesn't run as well as I would like
[21:01] <Bizzeh> julian-delphiki: thanks, manage to google for a mirror that my ISP runs, currently getting 12.4 mb/s now compared to 1.1mb/s i was getting on the automatically chosen server
[21:01] <sylphie> Speedy \ there's a whole set of pages on ubuntu site explaining your install/run options
[21:02] <computer> Hi. Simple problem = Logged in to Ubuntu Studio using XFCE shell (drop down menu) but now it won't let me log in using default Ubuntu studio shell (drop down menu). Even if choosing Ubuntu Studio shell from login menu it still logs me in using XFCE?
[21:02] <julian-delphiki> Speedy, it's just server, run it in virtualbox, or even virtualbox headless and ssh to it
[21:03] <Bizzeh> also, has i386 been dropped from server with 12.10?
[21:03] <Virunga> Inside the upstart stanza script i wrote "export MY_ENV=/a/path", but after running the service the variable ins't set, what am i doing wrong?
[21:03] <Virunga> I could show the code if you want to. Please, help me
[21:04] <Speedy> julian-delphiki:  I am just learning how to SSH.  I understand this is very common for you but I am just getting my feet wet.  Forgive me if I don't know all of the correct terms.  It is some cool stuff to me, we are using putty to SSH into our primary and secondary DNS servers
[21:04] <Virunga> Here it is http://pastie.org/5680075
[21:04] <Mobil> Speedy, since you downloaded the ISO, you can try downloading LiLi USB creator, and following the steps to making your ISO bootable using a USB
[21:05] <MK`> "Sorry, could not display all the contents of "trash": Operation not supported" D:
[21:05] <Speedy> Mobil:  That would be nice.  I will look at that...
[21:06] <ClientAlive> Thor: I see. Well, the situation is, I'm researching a lappy for purchas. I intend to 'request' a particular network card in the hope I may get it instead of whatever they feel like slapping in there. I'm on the aricrack-ng site now and and taking 2 things into consideration: (1) compatibility with aricrack and (2) compatibility with linux. Atheros is supposed to do well with linux compatibility; and, apparently, compatible with aircrack.
[21:06] <ClientAlive> Broadcom with the b43 driver (not the FOSS driver) supposedly great wtih aricrack, but we all know about it's compatability with linux and the hacking that needs to occur to get it working.
[21:06] <Mobil> Speedy, from there, you can just boot from USB, partition your drive, and then you can have your laptop be able to boot either to windows or ubuntu
[21:08] <julian-delphiki> ClientAlive: you will likely be unable to select what wireless card you want -- a lot of places wont give you the option
[21:08] <Thor> ClientAlive: the broadcom "hacking" is hardly hacking anymore, sure it used to be back in 04/05. Tho, I'd go for Atheros if you plan to use aircrack
[21:09] <ClientAlive> Thor: that's my tentative "first choice" right now. Glad to get some input. julian-delphiki: I hope so, but then again, it is hp  :p
[21:09] <Thor> ClientAlive: but as julian-delphiki said, you most likely won't get to choose at purchase, likely most won't know either.  but you can buy the card seperately aftwards and fit it. most computers have this ability
[21:09] <ClientAlive> If you're curious, this is what I'm pretty well settled on: http://www.shopping.hp.com/webapp/shopping/load_configuration.do?destination=review&email_id=2436514&jumpid=in_r329_emailconfig
[21:10] <ClientAlive> Oh, he said "unable" not able. My mistake.
[21:10] <julian-delphiki> ClientAlive: I would recommend getting a laptop that is built for linux, but that's my opinion
[21:10] <ClientAlive> I can ask tho
[21:11] <computer> Hi. Even if choosing Ubuntu Studio shell from drop down login menu it still logs me in using XFCE shell? Is there a way to reset login shell??
[21:11] <julian-delphiki> ClientAlive: https://www.system76.com/ is pretty awesome for laptops, for what it's worth.
[21:14] <ClientAlive> julian-delphiki: I'll take a peek. thx. No offense, but, fwiw I notice that the linux lappy sites tend to be much more expensive and don't offer anywhere near the gear you can get alsewhere - just my opinion.
[21:14] <Thor> julian-delphiki: wow those where clunky :P
[21:14] <julian-delphiki> Some guys at work use, them, they work great.
[21:15] <ClientAlive> Thor: what you said, yeah.

[21:20] <ClientAlive> What about getting an o/s disk with a new lappy purchase? Don't they have to provide an o/s disk? (not a recovery disk all chock full of bloat, an o/s disk). Can they legally refuse you that?

[21:24] <ClientAlive> julian-delphiki: yeah, I know It'll come out of the box loaded up with a bunch of crap but it looks like they are charging $20 for a "recovery disk". I need an o/s disk (becuse a person just needs one in case something happens and because the win vm I'll install on my ubuntu host needs to be clean  :)
[21:25] <ClientAlive> Anyway I may need some ammunition to get what I've got coming from them (I don't see how anyone can legally not provide the o/s disk).
[21:25] <julian-delphiki> If there's not a checkbox for it, you probably can't refuse it.

[21:26] <Haematoma> Is this possible?
[21:27] <julian-delphiki> ClientAlive: i don't think you have the option of not getting windows + their recovery media, is what i'm saying
[21:27] <julian-delphiki> Haematoma: no, it auths off of your system
[21:27] <julian-delphiki> so, it'll be accessible via anything that auths off PAM
[21:27] <ClientAlive> julian-delphiki: I'm not trying to not get windows I'm trying to find out if they 'have to" give me a physical operating system installation disk with my purchase.

[21:28] <Haematoma> julian-delphiki: I was thinking of adding an additional user and then giving that user permission to the downloads directory, but there might be a better way to restrict access.
[21:28] <[DeVil-BoY]> greetings, could someone please talk me through how to add a pptp vpn connection, start it at boot up and forward specific traffic onto it :)
[21:29] <[DeVil-BoY]> has to be done via cli
[21:29] <julian-delphiki> Haematoma: that's likely the best way, but you may want to move your downloads out of your home folder
[21:29] <julian-delphiki> and make THAT folder readable by both users
[21:30] <Haematoma> julian-delphiki: what is the benefit of moving Downloads outside of the Home folder?
[21:30] <julian-delphiki> Haematoma: so that he's not accessing files in your home directory
[21:30] <julian-delphiki> [DeVil-BoY]: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VPN
[21:30] <Haematoma> julian-delphiki: can't I just limit permission to the downloads folder? And everything outside of that directory has its own permissions?
[21:31] <julian-delphiki> Haematoma, Likely, I'm just paranoid :)
[21:31] <[DeVil-BoY]> julian-delphiki i'm on it
[21:31] <julian-delphiki> [DeVil-BoY]: then follow the directons under "VPN setup using the command line"
[21:31] <[DeVil-BoY]> right

[21:39] <k1l> !notunity | cub

For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[22:04] <luisrey> i came into this channel because i can't find another one
[22:04] <buntuBen> my setup: RAID5 on /dev/sda1,sdb1,sdc1,sdd1... /dev/sde1 is swap, /dev/sde2 is 12.04... /dev/sdf1 is spare
[22:05] <luisrey> ok, thank you so much

[22:05] <buntuBen> My SMART status says that /dev/sde is failing, so much so that if I log in, my memory becomes full with the "encountered an error" messages
[22:05] <MonkeyDust> buntuBen  ubuntu server?
[22:05] <buntuBen> MonkeyDust desktop
[22:05] <luisrey> ok :)
[22:05] <wdp> buntuBen, i've got a similar setup here; Though I only use it for /home and on another box only for /var/lib/libvirt. Which makes it unproblematic if i replace a disk or reinstall some distribution.
[22:06] <luisrey> thank you too, ubottu and auronandance
[22:07] <wdp> buntuBen, then why don't you remove sde and use the spare?
[22:07] <SaschaP> :'( can't anybody help me with my problem?
[22:08] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP: you have to give us a specific problem and what any error messages are before anyone can help
[22:08] <buntuBen> wdp, that's my plan, but the mdadm setup is on sde. I just want to make sure that once I install on sdf, I can get the raid back without formatting and starting all over

[22:09] <julian-delphiki> SaschaP, and this is ubuntu? You should just try using VLC
[22:09] <SaschaP> in firefox and vlc the audio output works
[22:09] <SaschaP> julian: i use kid3 for tagging the music
[22:10] <MonkeyDust> kid and phonon is something KDE

[22:13] <phy1729> I want for host x to resolve to x.example.com. Should I use dns-search or domain in /etc/network/interfaces?
[22:13] <phy1729> adding domain example.com to resolv.conf works but is overwritten on reboot

[22:14] <scarrs> any gurus here with mpd expertise to help me get mpd going?
[22:14] <julian-delphiki> phy1729: you could just type the whole domain
[22:15] <julian-delphiki> phy1729: or what are you trying to accomplish
[22:15] <MonkeyDust> !ask | scarrs
[22:15] <ubottu> scarrs: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[22:15] <phy1729> julian-delphiki: I ssh so much it's nice for ssh x to mean ssh x.example.com
[22:16] <zykotic10> phy1729: bash alias' are really hand for things like that...
[22:16] <scarrs> I am having trouble getting mpd going, I have edited mpd.conf but am unable to play songs (I don't know how) please help
[22:16] <phy1729> and I'd like it for other commands too so an .ssh_config wouldn't work
[22:16] <julian-delphiki> phy1729: could always throw an entry in /etc/hosts, or make an alias
[22:16] <MonkeyDust> !info mpd
[22:16] <ubottu> mpd (source: mpd): Music Player Daemon. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.16.5-1ubuntu4 (quantal), package size 211 kB, installed size 555 kB
[22:16] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: Are you saying that if someone inside of your network (or outside) types in x.example.com, you want it to go to this specific computer?
[22:16] <phy1729> PatrickDickey: I'm using the example domain as an example
[22:17] <PatrickDickey> Yes, I understand that.
[22:17] <PatrickDickey> But what you want, is for someone inside of your LAN to access a specfic computer by it's hostname.domain right?
[22:17] <usr13> phy1729: That would be a function of your router.
[22:18] <phy1729> what I want is to minimize typing
[22:18] <julian-delphiki> usr13, PatrickDickey: i think what he wants is to not have to type the domain for a certain domain, on his local machine
[22:18] <julian-delphiki> but i could be wrong
[22:18] <phy1729> yes what julian-delphiki said
[22:18] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: Is the domain that you're trying to minimize on your LAN, or on the Internet?
[22:18] <phy1729> LAN
[22:19] <julian-delphiki> phy1729: you can throw your search line in a certain file, one sec,
[22:19] <phy1729> adding a line "domain exmple.com" to resolv.conf works fine but is overwritten on reboot
[22:19] <SaschaP> seems that nobody can help me here
[22:19] <wbf> With what?
[22:19] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: How many computers are on the LAN, that you want to get to?
[22:19] <usr13> julian-delphiki: The hosts file
[22:19] <wbf> SaschaP, with what?
[22:19] <KI4RO> I got the printer connected to an Ubuntu server to be accessible by my Ubuntu laptops.  I have Samba running in the Ubuntu server but the printer cannot be seen by my Windows PC.  Any ideas?
[22:19] <usr13> phy1729: julian-delphiki But again, the router normally does that for you.
[22:19] <julian-delphiki> usr13: no
[22:19] <usr13> no?
[22:20] <phy1729> PatrickDickey: I'm on the LAN I ssh and ping around a lot so I just don't want to type the domain over and over again
[22:20] <julian-delphiki> usr13: not hosts file.
[22:20] <PatrickDickey> usr13: That works, if it's a few computers. Otherwise, I was going to suggest something like OpenDNS to phy1729.
[22:20] <julian-delphiki> its the resolvconf package
[22:20] <Lunar_Lamp> phy1729: add dns-search example.com to /etc/network/interfaces for your network interface.
[22:20] <phy1729> Lunar_Lamp: thanks
[22:20] <SaschaP> i've descriped the bug above, my quodlibet and kid3 crashed when trying to play a music, and gmusicbrowser also don't work
[22:21] <PatrickDickey> SaschaP: did you pastebin the errors that you're getting?
[22:21] <Lunar_Lamp> phy1729: actually, thinking about it, I'm not sure that will help with this irritating new network-manager.
[22:21] <SaschaP> patrick-dickey not yet, where should i pastebin them?
[22:21] <julian-delphiki> phy1729: i think somewhere in /etc/resolvconf/run/ there is a file that goes at the top of your resolv.conf when it regenrates
[22:21]  * PatrickDickey uses OpenDNS to control everything. That and Amahi Home Server.
[22:21] <PatrickDickey> SaschaP: paste.ubuntu.com
[22:22] <phy1729> Lunar_Lamp: if it adds a "domain example.com" line to resolv.conf it'll work just fine
[22:22] <phy1729> well I suppose I have a server I can reboot lets test it

[22:22] <Lunar_Lamp> phy1729: aye, my suggestion would work, but I think that if you're using NetworkManager, you won't have an eth0 section in /etc/network/interfaces :-)
[22:23] <ikhanh4x> i usually use "curl ipogre.com" to get my public ip address from command line
[22:23] <PatrickDickey> Lunar_Lamp: You're right about that. All I have is lo0 in mine.
[22:23] <ilidur> I'm trying to create a modified live cd for a class and the repository for the software only has packages for natty and older. How bad would it be to try and install it on something newer, such as Oneiric?

[22:23] <SaschaP> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1529300/
[22:24] <Lunar_Lamp> phy1729: edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf./head (or tail if you prefer it to appended rathher than prepended).
=== StackProphet_ is now known as StackProphet
[22:24] <phy1729> Lunar_Lamp: first thing I do is uninstall nm
[22:24] <usr13> Lunar_Lamp: phy1729 PatrickDickey Sounds a lot like setting Static Leases up with hostnames on the router would do the trick.
[22:25] <Lunar_Lamp> phy1729: heh, yes, I hate it too ;-)
[22:25] <ikhanh4x> the actual website is nice though because there are some tools that can be of help like the port scanner
[22:25] <phy1729> usr13: I already did that
[22:25] <clone1018> Shouldn't "auto,defaults,exec,users,x-gvfs-show" allow me to chmod +x a file on this drive?
[22:25] <phy1729> I just want to type less
[22:26] <usr13> phy1729: "type less"?
[22:26] <usr13> phy1729: Use shorter names?
[22:26] <phy1729> Lunar_Lamp: "dns-search" adds a search line to resolv.conf not domain and doesn't work
[22:26] <zykotic10> phy1729: i repeat, bash alias are really handy at reducing keystrokes...
[22:27] <KI4RO> I got the printer connected to an Ubuntu server to be accessible by my Ubuntu laptops.  I have Samba running in the Ubuntu server but the printer cannot be seen by my Windows PC.  Any ideas?
[22:27] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: If you're able to, set up static leases on the router as usr13 suggested. Otherwise, if it's only a couple of computers, you can either add them to the hosts file or sign up for something like OpenDNS (which does most of this on their servers for you).
[22:27] <phy1729> zykotic10: I'm aware but I'm not making 27 or more aliases for 9 servers and 3 commands
[22:27] <Jikan> Anyone knows if Thunar supports scripts like Nautilus with nautilus-scripts? I'm looking for an alternative to Nautilus but I do need my scripts…
[22:27] <usr13> phy1729: I have names like joe, fred, marge  and I just go:   ssh joe@joe  (The router resolves joe to it's IP for me.)
[22:27] <Lunar_Lamp> phy1729: try editing /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head instead then :-)
[22:28] <phy1729> PatrickDickey: they all have static IPs already and DNS already does x.example.com -> IP
[22:28] <phy1729> usr13: I have 1 or 2 letter names that CNAME to the full name
[22:28] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: if you type nslookup x in a terminal, what does it give you? (x being the hostname of one of your computers)?
[22:30] <phy1729> Lunar_Lamp: my bad dns-search does work I had other config borked
[22:31] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: do you have one server that handles DNS for your LAN?
[22:31] <phy1729> usr13: all the servers are named after elements the elemental number is the IP and the abbreviation CNAMES to the full name so h.example.com CNAMEs to hydrogen.example.com and is 10.foo.bar.1
[22:32] <phy1729> PatrickDickey: right now yes (kind of have to forward the microsoft domains) but soon to be 2 with CARP
[22:33] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: what do you mean by have to forward the Microsoft Domains? Are you using their homeserver.com domain?
[22:34] <phy1729> _msdcs.example.com and _sites and _tcp and _udp and DomainDnsZones and ForestDnsZones

[22:35] <PatrickDickey> phy1729: Out of curiosity, why are you using example.com? Why don't you make your own domain name, since it's only going to be accessed inside of your network?
[22:35] <ubuntun00b> if i disable bridge,  ipv6 works fine .. if i enable bridge , ipv6 does not work
[22:35] <ubuntun00b> is there some special setting to make ipv6 work via a brige ?
[22:35] <ubuntun00b> bridge*

[22:45] <jkt> I'm not familiar with the naming conventions; do I have to prefix them somehow?

[22:46] <PatrickDickey> SaschaP: I do, but I'm not finding anything.
[22:47] <scarrs> PatrickDickey: sound works with http vlc and banshee just fine, I am guessing in my mpd.conf file I am missing something

[22:47] <jkt> doh, looks like the builders are on 12.04 and the repo is just for 12.10
[22:49] <SaschaP> patrickdickey: I've tried these programs in 11.10 but i don't like them, and especially for tagging mp3s Kid3 is very good... so i want these programs (gmusicbrowser, quodlibet, kid3) to work again

[22:53] <phy1729> but thanks for looking
[22:53] <buntuBen> if I have bad sectors on a hard drive, will dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sde write over those sectors and make them usable, or does the S.M.A.R.T permanently disable those bad sectors?
[22:53] <PatrickDickey> No problem phy1729. I hope you find the answer. In theory, if you're able to search by the shortname, and resolve to the host, you should be able to say ping shortname or ssh shortname.
[22:54] <PatrickDickey> scarrs: which application are you trying to play music through?
[22:54] <escott> buntuBen, SMART does not disable anything it reports it. The hardware has determined those sectors are permanently damaged and will never use them again. you should be buying a new drive
[22:55] <jitsii> would anyone share their opinion as to what their favorite linux keylogger is?
[22:55] <phy1729> PatrickDickey: I added dns-search which makes ping c mean ping c.example.com and on DNS I have c.example.com CNAME'd to carbon.example.com and that to the IP so it all works

[23:08] <clone1018> I'm not guessing there's a filesystem that has POSIX-esque file permissions that I can read on windows later?
[23:08] <computer> No.....Using Extreme Graphics on Ubuntu Studio 12.04
[23:08] <Tex_Nick> buntuBen ... escott has you covered there :)
[23:09] <escott> clone1018, no because Win is not posix. there are ext drivers for windows. not sure if i trust them, but that just puts the problem on the windows side
[23:09] <computer> Found a driver on the Intel website.
[23:09] <buntuBen> escott, the raid I was referring to is separate from the drive I'm trying to replace. My setup is /sde2 is the ext4 which 12.04LTS resides. I have a software RAID5 with /dev/sda1-sdd1 where my data (non-os related) resides
[23:09] <escott> clone1018, you can modify the mount permission in /etc/fstab to set them to be wide open if you need to allow multiple users to manipulate the same NTFS partition
[23:10] <buntuBen> escott, the hdd that is failing is sde
[23:10] <prih> ciao
[23:10] <escott> buntuBen, i dont see how replacing sde with sdf is going to affect the raid
[23:10] <computer> intel i845GE
[23:12] <samg> Hey everyone, i'm looking for some help installing a driver for a Atheros ar8161 ethernet.  I installed ubuntu 12.10 and have no network connection.  I know what driver i need and have it download.  I simply need to know the filepath i need to place it in and what commands i need to execute to implement it.  The driver file i believe i need to install is linux-backports-modules-cw-3.4-precise-generic.
[23:12] <escott> computer, none of that was an answer to "why?"
[23:12] <samg> if i had a internet connection on that machine i would be done already
[23:13] <prih> !list
[23:13] <ubottu> prih: No warez here! This is not a file sharing channel (or network); read the channel topic. If you're looking for information about me, type « /msg ubottu !bot ». If you're looking for a channel, see « /msg ubottu !alis ».
[23:13] <buntuBen> escott, maybe I don't fully understand the workings of it then. I thought the mount info and configuration for the _software_ raid, being on sde, would not work properly if I just installed Ubuntu from disk to sdf. That's why I'm trying to clone, so that all the info is still there.
[23:13] <computer> Ubuntu Studio 12.04 LTS with Intel Celeron 2.4Ghz Intel Chipset i845GE Extreme Graphics.
[23:14] <computer> Why What? Install the driver? Because it seem like the best idea to improve graphics.
[23:14] <escott> buntuBen, /etc/mdadm.conf has a copy of the raid layout, but each pbr? on the raid has an entry which lists the GUIDS of the other devices and the personality
[23:14] <alami> how can i check my NIC driver working?
[23:14] <computer> Why not install it?
[23:14] <PatrickDickey> computer, download the tar.gz file. use tar xvf filename.tar.gz to untar (extract) it, then cd into the directory it creates. THere should be instructions on compiling and installing the driver there.
[23:15] <escott> computer, because you don't know what you are doing and can break your system.
[23:15] <escott> computer, why do you need to update the drivers. what is telling you that?
[23:15] <k1l> computer: the intel driver is in the kernel already. so no need for a driver
[23:16] <PatrickDickey> Actually computer, escott has a good point. What benefit does the driver from Intel's site give you?
[23:16] <computer> Was reading up on it and decided to find a driver?
[23:16] <k1l> computer: a new driver will not make that card to a tripple SLI card monster. so what do you want with that driver?
[23:16] <PatrickDickey> computer: Do you have any actual issues with the current driver? Like crashes or slowness?
[23:16] <computer> This driver? IntelGraphics_20040607_ i386.rpm
[23:17] <computer> Slow graphics.
[23:17] <k1l> computer: with a manually installed driver you will loose support from ubuntu and have to install it every kernelupgrade
[23:17] <escott> computer, you happen to have a slow GPU
[23:17] <buntuBen> escott, thanks for your info. I will move forward with the cloning to a larger drive. If the RAID for some reason no longer works, will copying mdadm.conf over to a fresh OS install work?
[23:18] <escott> buntuBen, or just mdadm --assemble --scan or some variant
[23:18] <computer> I'm happy to try installing the driver.....Just to see for myself :) Just need to convert the file?
[23:19] <buntuBen> escott, alright, appreciate your support.
[23:19] <computer> Also have this driver = 20030212-i386-Linux.tar.gz
[23:20] <theodore> hello
[23:20] <theodore> i installed ubuntu 13.04
[23:20] <jazzkutya> give me your time machine pls
[23:20] <jazzkutya> :)
[23:20] <Bizzeh> that was probably a bad move since its 3 months away yet
[23:20] <PatrickDickey> theodore: #ubuntu+1 is your best option for any Raring questions.
[23:20] <escott> computer, the best thing you can do to improve your graphics performance is to open the case and hit the CPU with a hammer. If you don't want to buy a new machine you can try !xubuntu
[23:21] <theodore> thank young001 thank you PatrickDickey
[23:21] <scarrs> I most likely solved my problem PatrickDickey... would you like to know what I did?
[23:21] <jazzkutya> that gpu is good enough for 2d work
[23:21] <PatrickDickey> computer and escott, I was just reading an askubuntu.com thread that suggests Lubuntu.
[23:21] <PatrickDickey> scarrs: yes, I would.
[23:22] <PatrickDickey> computer: http://askubuntu.com/questions/95447/which-ubuntu-version-will-work-best-with-845g-motherboard
[23:22] <scarrs> PatrickDickey: I changed group "nogroup" to group "audio" in mpd.conf ;)
[23:22] <PatrickDickey> And it's working now?
[23:22] <computer> Have tried Dyne bolic on my system and the graphics are a lot better so i know the graphics CAN be better but I'd like to stick with Ubuntu Studio.
[23:22] <Atum> Test
[23:23] <scarrs> gmpc works now ... working on ampache
[23:23] <scarrs> :)
[23:23] <Atum> Is this message showing?
[23:23] <k1l> !ask | Atum
[23:23] <ubottu> Atum: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[23:23] <scarrs> yes
[23:23] <PatrickDickey> Yes Atum. Both the Test and this message are showing.
[23:23] <Bizzeh> i still have to run ubuntu on my laptop instead of my main pc, linux doesnt support half the hardware on my motherboard, and doesnt support by graphics card properly
[23:23] <Atum> Ok, thanks
[23:23] <Bizzeh> (sabertooth 990fx mobo with hd7870 gfx)
[23:24] <PatrickDickey> scarrs: when you get ampache working, post your solution in here also (as long as it's short). That way someone else might be able to get help from it.
[23:24] <kjs> http://fpaste.org/CUwI/ - that means inodes are at 2% usage right? not 2% left?
[23:24] <scarrs> will do
[23:24] <scarrs> (ampache is awesome with localplay)
[23:24] <Bizzeh> no network, no audio, no usb3, and everything else is slow as fuck. and the gfx runs as if im just using vesa, even though ubuntu claims im using the radeon driver
[23:25] <scarrs> any thanks
[23:25] <theodore> what is the recommended irc chat client for ubuntu ?
[23:25] <PatrickDickey> Bizzeh: which ATI card do you have, and which version of Ubuntu?
[23:25] <scarrs> anyway*
[23:25] <theodore> i am using xchat 2.8.8 right now the most current release
[23:25] <PatrickDickey> theodore: whichever one you want to use. I'm using quassel right now.
[23:25] <alami> theodore: use irssi
[23:25] <Bizzeh> PatrickDickey: 7870, 12.10
[23:27] <PatrickDickey> Bizzeh, which network card? That might be the first thing you want to fix, so you can get updated drivers.
[23:28] <Bizzeh> realtek pcie gbe
[23:29] <computer> Also have tried (lol) randomly just trying anything of forums (Xorg installs, Updates...Ect) just to see if graphics can be improved and they can but hell if I know what I did now?? The point is it can so why turn my back on Studio when it's just what I'm looking for? Anyway I'm going to try.
[23:29] <theodore> i need a system info script for xchat
[23:30] <theodore> good a good link for any perl or xchat scripts?
[23:30] <computer> I just wanted to know why this wouldn't work?? ---> sudo alien -d /home/computer/Desktop/IntelGraphics_20040607_ i386.rpm
[23:32] <jazzkutya> computer: grapchics driver are usually too specialized so they can not be installed on distributions other than the one they were made for
[23:33] <jhutchins> theodore: You're not thinking of dumping sysinfo in a support chat are you?
[23:34] <jhutchins> computer: Does it not work?  What errors does it give?
[23:35] <computer> Why is my path not working? It says not found?
[23:35] <blackking7> Hi, I am having problems with switching to Hebrew fonts in LibreOffice Writer. Whenever I try to switch to a different font, it won't switch from Lohit Hindi to the font I want to use. Can anyone help?
[23:35] <malkauns> how do u get global menu to work for apps over remote X?
[23:35] <computer> Oh sorry.....Yes it says not found?
[23:36] <PatrickDickey> computer: type cd /home/computer/Desktop
[23:37] <computer> Thank u :)
[23:38] <PatrickDickey> computer, did alien work now?
[23:39] <PatrickDickey> computer, you should only have to type alien -d IntelGraphics_20040607_ i386.rpm at this point. But, I would say type ls first, and then copy the exact filename and paste it after the alien -d command.
[23:41] <theodore> jhutchins no i just want it for people who need to view my system info on my own irc net
[23:41] <computer> Tried a few thing including this (After cd) ----> sudo alien -d IntelGraphics_20040607_ i386.rpm Still "not found"
[23:41] <theodore> jhutchins do you have a sysinfo script I may use?
[23:41] <islan> hm, I don't suppose there is a wireless channel?
[23:42] <escott> computer, please don't ask about alien in this channel. its unsupporte
[23:43] <computer> I think more the point is why does the path not work??
[23:44] <buntuBen> computer, did you see the IntelGraphics... file after issuing ls?
[23:44] <computer> Yes
[23:45] <buntuBen> computer, type (without quotes) "sudo alien -d Intel" and then press tab.  It will complete the filename so as to remove human error
[23:46] <buntuBen> computer, if it still says not found, it may be referring to alien.  In which case, you need to find where alien is installed and issue the command from there
[23:47] <computer> "not found" ok I'll try that
[23:47]  * PatrickDickey wonders if computer installed alien
[23:47] <computer> Yes installed alien :)
[23:47] <lu_> hi
[23:48]  * SaschaP will use windows again, if nobody knows how to solve my problem... can't be, that after a simple upgrade the gstreamer-system is getting crazy!
[23:48] <JonEdney> Well.  I installed 12.10 on free space next to my Windows 7 installation.  When I select "Windows" from the GRUB OS selection screen, it just refreshes the screen.  I'm not familiar with GRUB, is there any way to look into this?
=== mike is now known as Guest39197
[23:49] <buntuBen> computer, what did it say after you tabbed?
[23:49] <PatrickDickey> !grub | JonEdney
[23:49] <ubottu> JonEdney: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[23:50] <PatrickDickey> SaschaP: You might check for a channel dedicated to one of the music applications you're using. They may be able to help you get the problem resolved.
[23:50] <JonEdney> Thanks there PatrickDickey
[23:51] <PatrickDickey> No problem JonEdney. Hope it helps you.
[23:51] <JonEdney> If not, I'll just start from scratch again; the night is young!
[23:52] <PatrickDickey> JonEdney: you could try sudo update-grub in a terminal window. See if it finds your Windows OS.
[23:53] <sybariten> any version of ubuntiu that will fit on a CD, burned?
[23:53] <sybariten> well burned as an ISO burn that is
[23:54] <sybariten> i have DLed two of the latest images here and they seem to be closer to 800 megs ....  i386 and amd64
[23:54] <JonEdney> PatrickDickey, it shows up but it says (Loader) after.  That seem accurate? "Found Windows 7 (loader) on /dev/sda1"
[23:54] <PatrickDickey> sybariten: any release prior to 12.10 will have one. Or, you could check Lubuntu out. It's small enough to burn to a CD.
[23:54] <demonio1> hi all i had a problem
[23:54] <PatrickDickey> Yep JonEdney, that's what it should say.
[23:54] <sybariten> PatrickDickey: merci
[23:55] <PatrickDickey> You're welcome sybariten. I don't know how to say it in French. ;-)
[23:55]  * PatrickDickey thinks it's time to reinstall Rosetta Stone under wine....
[23:56] <demonio1> hellooo :D
[23:56] <PatrickDickey> what problem did you have demonio1?
[23:56] <bestdnd> using gnome classic, how can i remove a shortcut icon from the top bar?
[23:57] <demonio1> PatrickDickey i know that my problem is no subject by this channel, so pls can i ask it in query?
[23:57] <islan> dang, is there really no way to get a working driver for BCM43142 on i386 with kernel 3.5.0?
[23:58] <PatrickDickey> You can ask in the channel. We'll either try to help, or redirect you to where you can get help. demonio1
=== StormTrooper is now known as PermissionDenied
[23:59] <islan> the only fix that I've been able to find either involves downgrading the kernel or requires 64-bit OS
[23:59] <demonio1> PatrickDickey ok i'm studing linux architecture so i can't understand what is filesystem
