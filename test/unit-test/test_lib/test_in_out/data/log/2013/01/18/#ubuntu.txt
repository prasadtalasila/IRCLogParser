[00:04] <jrib> irv: up to you; I wouldn't trust such a thing
[00:06] <irv> jrib: well i mean the only thing i would expect it to write to the / is that demo.. and if it did write anything elsewhere, it's just a blank VM with that server installed
[00:06] <irv> and i just tried and it does work when i launch as root :s
[00:06] <irv> stupid thing
[00:06] <calavera> Has anybody else had problems with dualbooting with 7 across two drives in a UEFI system?
[00:06] <jrib> irv: it's probably a trick so you run it as root and it exploits you (/sarcasm) :P
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[00:07] <irv> ahah, gabe wouldn't do that... would he? D:
[00:07] <irv> i guess i can just run it as root as that's probably easier than undoing sudo chmod o+w /
[00:07] <usr13> calavera: Please elaborate.
[00:08] <calavera> Well... I can either fix either the MBR or GRUB, however, GRUB seems to be incapable of booting into 7. It gives me an invalid filepath error.
[00:08] <calavera> I fixed MBR, and now I've been stuck using Windows for the past week or so.
[00:09] <usr13> calavera: So how did you fix the MBR?  (What did you do?)
[00:09] <calavera> I ran fixmbr on the repair disk.
[00:10] <usr13> calavera: So you wiped out grub? Ok.  First off, your assumption that grub is incapable of booting Win7 is wrong.  So....
[00:10] <usr13> !grub | calavera
[00:10] <ubottu> calavera: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows?

[00:12] <calavera> bikadder: gnu/ Linux
[00:12] <usr13> calavera: Yea, that is obvious.
[00:12] <calavera> So short of wiping both drives and installing 7 in a VM, what can be done about this?
[00:12] <usr13> calavera: (If you think you can get Win7's boot loader to boot Linux, well, suffice to say, it's not gonna happen).
[00:13] <calavera> I wasn't implying that.
[00:13] <usr13> calavera: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub

[00:13] <usr13> calavera: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub
[00:13] <calavera> I can restore GRUB and the MBR all day long, that doesn't fix my issue.

[00:14] <usr13> calavera: Ok, let's start over.  What is the issue?
[00:14] <usr13> blkadder: Do you understand the situation?
[00:14] <calavera> I want GRUB to be able to boot 7. When I select that option, it gives me an invalid filepath error.
[00:14] <lauratika> quick question, good alternative to chrome and firefox?

[00:15] <lauratika> is that base on webkit engine
[00:16] <iceroot> lauratika: iceweasel is firefox with another name
[00:16] <usr13> blkadder: He said he did fixmbr, I suppose we will just have to take him at his word, (unless he tells us otherwise).
[00:17] <calavera> So any ideas?
[00:17] <lauratika> oh!... some other alternative?
[00:17] <calavera> Try opera
[00:17] <iceroot> lauratika: for what reason you need another browser?
[00:17] <usr13> calavera: Did you re-install MS Windows?  (As blkadder suggests?)
[00:18] <calavera> Yes.
[00:18] <usr13> calavera: Or did you just do fixmbr?
[00:18] <calavera> http://zacbrowser.com/
[00:18] <lauratika> trying something new...
[00:18] <calavera> I reinstalled it altogether.
[00:18] <calavera> After fixmbr failed.
[00:18] <iceroot> lauratika: then have a look at the software center which browser are there, also have a look at google if you just want a list of alternative browsers

[00:19] <calavera> What do you mean by "wiped"
[00:20] <calavera> Do you mean it was a corrupted install, was it corrupted during in update/ regular use, what?
[00:20] <Zattack> none of my windows files are there anymore
[00:20] <calavera> Zattack: Try making a liveusb, and hope for the best.

=== g_byers is now known as gbyers[Away]
[00:21] <usr13> calavera: Oh, I see.  Sorry.  I missunderstood.  Well, I guess it's back to square one.  Just re-install ubuntu.  But maybe this time, you might try resizing the Win7 partition with the on-board tools.  I think it's something like Control Panel -> System and Security -> Administrative Tools ->  Computer Management -> Disk Management
[00:22] <Zattack> i stopped it quick but it had startted to add ubuntu files to thr drives root
[00:22] <usr13> calavera: I'm not sure where you went wrong, but could be that your non-destructive partitioning was not so non-destructive?
[00:22] <blkadder> LOL
[00:23] <calavera> usr13:  I could reinstall *buntu, but I'm using two hard drives in my laptop. W7 is on my primary, and *buntu is on my secondary.
[00:23] <calavera> They're not partitions.
[00:23] <tekkbuzz> Zattack: was it your Z drive?
[00:23] <Zattack> c
[00:24] <usr13> calavera: Well, again, I don't know where you went wrong.  Doing it on a second drive should be a pretty safe proceedure.  I suppose the second time around you may see the error of your way(s)...?
[00:24] <lauratika> noooooooooo i want to know what the comunity is using as an alternative...
[00:26] <calavera> I'll just reinstall, and hope for the best. Also, for some reason, GNU/Linux is messing with my VRAM/ UEFI on the motherboard. I have to open up my laptop and short out two pins to even be able to select from where to boot from. I then later have to reflash the UEFI.
[00:26] <blkadder> Ugh.
[00:26] <usr13> calavera: Lots of people install Linux everyday and set up dual boot systems, some on single drives, some on separate drives, it's a relatively straight-forward process.  There are ways to mess it up, but if you just watch what you're doing, you should do ok.
[00:26] <blkadder> What sort of laptop?
[00:27] <usr13> calavera: I don't know about UEFI, would have to do a bit of research on that.  Maybe someone else can give you some advise about it?

[00:29] <kderr> blkadder: Yeah
[00:30] <kderr> blkadder: It seems to just completely skip anything I write in the "chef" section. I'm guessing I need to make sure my AMI has a particular package?
[00:31] <blkadder> kderr: My knowledge of chef is somewhat limited but in my experience using it I'd knife the box first to do all the prep work (bootstrap)
[00:32] <kderr> blkadder: Yeah, I'm trying to find an alternative to that.
[00:32] <blkadder> You also need a chef server. Are you using hosted chef from Opscode?
[00:33] <kderr> blkadder: My chef server is another ec2 instance.
[00:33] <blkadder> kderr: Gotcha.
[00:33] <kderr> blkadder: knife bootstrap requires you to have ssh access to the box from where you're running knife, which isn't always possible for me.
[00:33] <kderr> blkadder: Having cloud-init take care of bootstrapping chef for me would be pretty cool. I found that example sitting there, but I can't figure out how to make it work.
[00:34] <blkadder> kderr: I see. Haven't used it...
[00:34] <blkadder> Just knife.

[00:40] <z30n1c> is anyone bored that could give me a really quick lesson about linux flavors etc.
[00:40] <sylphie> why not?
[00:40] <z30n1c> me?
[00:40] <sylphie> sure
[00:41] <z30n1c> brilliant.
[00:41] <sylphie> what do you need to know?
[00:41] <Mathrys83> i just installed lilo and lost my other os's in my boot list. lilo doesnt want to find them
[00:41] <z30n1c> whats the main difference between linux distros?
[00:42] <iLogical> why is qantal software download so much slower?
[00:42] <sylphie> z30n1c \ that difference would basically be what software comes with it, how they install, how you get packages

[00:44] <Mathrys83> is there a better bootloader out then lilo?
[00:44] <sylphie> z30n1c \ for example, ubuntu tries to atuomate the installs so that users can be dummies
[00:44] <sylphie> z30n1c \ likewise, it automates the process of getting packages
[00:45] <Tex_Nick> z30n1c : your question peers into murky waters ... you might have a look at ... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Linux_distributions ... to beter define your question :-)
[00:45] <z30n1c> the problem i always have is understanding the core basics.
[00:45] <magma> hi, in my huge network there are 2 machines which have the same ip. I know one of them, is it possible to find the hostname of the other machine?
[00:46] <magma> or other thing that can be used to identify it ?
[00:46] <sylphie> z30n1c \ if you want a linux that gives you a reason to learn the linux essdentials, on the other end of the sclae is slackware linux
[00:46] <blkadder> magma: Man arp.
[00:46] <z30n1c> Please dont get me wrong. I have googled my a**e off tring to find answers to my questions.
[00:46] <usr13> z30n1c: Main difference is package management.
[00:46] <x__> Why isn't the 'Full Disk Encryption' option available when I want to install 12.10 alongside with Windows?
[00:47] <blkadder> x__ Seriously?
[00:47] <dr_willis> because it cant fully encrypt the windows partions on the disk... would be my gyess
[00:47] <x__> yes
[00:47] <blkadder> See what dr_willis said...
[00:47] <sylphie> z30n1c \ in-between is debian linux (which ununtu is based on) and centos
[00:48] <x__> i have two disks, would like to keep win7 on one, and install ubuntu with FDE on the other, how do i do this from the 12.10 installer?
[00:48] <z30n1c> you mention file extensions,
[00:48] <z30n1c> they lose me in linux.
[00:48] <z30n1c> rpm, or deb etcc
[00:48] <usr13> z30n1c: file extensions are a non-issue on Linux systems.
[00:48] <blkadder> x__: Choose the second disk as the installation target.
[00:48] <sylphie> z30n1c \ file extensions don't necessarily mean anything in linux. The OS doesn't enforce them
[00:49] <z30n1c> but they are there right? for help rather than nedd?
[00:49] <z30n1c> *need
[00:49] <sylphie> z30n1c \ rpm is the way redhat (and centos) packages are distributed
[00:49] <x__> blkadder, it only allows you to choose disks AFTER you select 'alongside windows' or 'full disk with encryption / erase windows'
[00:49] <usr13> z30n1c: Yes, they are there.  rpm is Redhat Package Management  They do mean something, but just to the user.
[00:50] <sylphie> z30n1c \ it's not just a different file extension, it's a different format
[00:50] <blkadder> x__: So choose alongside windows and then select the second disk.
[00:50] <z30n1c> if i try to install the wrong rpm or deb etc on any linux system im using sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt,
[00:50] <sylphie> z30n1c \ while dev file are how debian packages are distributed
[00:50] <z30n1c> if i download the source and build it, tends to work every time.
[00:50] <x__> blkadder, that's what i did, and it never encrypted the second disk
[00:51] <jrib> z30n1c: and then you're left to maintain it
[00:51] <sylphie> z30n1c \ that's because debs and rpms are pre-built, but they are pre-built for certain distros
[00:51] <magma> blkadder: ok, there is a lot of subnets, so I cannot find it through arp
[00:51] <usr13> z30n1c: There is a lot to learn, that is true.  But the good news is, the learning curve is very steep.
[00:52] <jonascj> Hi, I'll give the question another try: Anyone using dmenu and able to specify fonts?
[00:52] <z30n1c> okay so deb / rpm etc are just easy to install against ./make etc ?
[00:52] <blkadder> x__: I wasn't aware that you needed encryption.
[00:52] <x__> here's a screenshot of what i'm talking about http://i1-news.softpedia-static.com/images/news-700/Ubuntu-12-10-Adds-Encrypted-Installation.png
[00:52] <sylphie> z30n1c \ though the danger of ubuntus highly automated installs and packaging is the number of times things go wrong
[00:53] <usr13> z30n1c: Yes, (as opposed to compiling from source).
[00:53] <x__> it only let's you do full disk encryption IF you wipe the other OS
[00:53] <blkadder> Select the full disk encryption then choose the second disk would be my guess...
[00:53] <jrib> jonascj: how are you trying?
[00:53] <z30n1c> and from compliing from source, thats when i gzip / unrar and ./make etc?
[00:54] <blkadder> x__: But since you are doing it on the other disk it shouldn't make any difference...

[00:54] <blkadder> magma: What type of host?
[00:54] <sylphie> z30n1c \ when you make packages from source, you are doing what the dsitributers of debsd and rpms are trying to do
[00:54] <warz> i dont see the line that i usually look for, where i would add "text"
[00:55] <jrib> jonascj: try something from the output of xlsfonts

[00:56] <Mathrys83> with syslinux already installed can i just unistall lilo and be ok? (its never that simple i know)
[00:56] <z30n1c> okay that makes sense.
[00:56] <usr13> z30n1c: compiling from source has several steps,  tar xvf, configure, make, make install

[00:56] <delac> how to route packets to DEST_IP/PORT from ad-hoc device (eth1) to a tunnel (listening LOCALHOST/PORT)?
[00:57] <jonascj> jrib: fonts from the xlsfonts works and i've been at that patch for 30minutes. "patch p1 < patch_name.diff" fails.
[00:57] <z30n1c> just for fun:  i knew when i was a newbie when i got really excited about learning "screen"
[00:57] <jrib> jonascj: well where are you running that?
[00:57] <usr13> z30n1c: Different distros have different startup processes, (processes which run all the various startup scripts which set the system in motion).
[00:57] <lee8oi> screen is great. I'm still excited about it :P
[00:58] <jrib> lee8oi: try tmux
[00:58] <jonascj> jrib: sorry, running what?
[00:58] <sylphie> z30n1c \ ubuntu (and debian) by default set things up to start the system into X windows
[00:58] <lee8oi> jrib, noted, thanks
[00:58] <usr13> z30n1c: Debian and Ubuntu (and some others), use "upstart"
[00:58] <jrib> jonascj: the patch command you just pasted in this channel
[00:59] <lee8oi> jrib, you can run this remotely and close out your connection without losing anything?
[00:59] <jrib> lee8oi: yes
[00:59] <lee8oi> jrib, interesting.
[00:59] <sylphie> z30n1c \ while on the opposite end, slackware starts your system into a command console, and you start X windows with the command "startx"
[00:59] <jrib> lee8oi: it's very similar to screen, just written by someone else.  It's actually what's used by default on bsd
[00:59] <z30n1c> started a year or two back with a version of ubuntu but command line only. didnt know for a good month or two that startx chucked be into a gui
[00:59] <lee8oi> jrib, the colors alone make it very attractive
[01:00] <lee8oi> is it in the Ubuntu repos?
[01:00] <usr13> z30n1c: Ubuntu and Debain have [arguably] the most sophisticated / advanced package management system and the most extensive repositories.
[01:00] <jrib> lee8oi: yes
[01:00] <lee8oi> jrib, sorry dumb question...lol
[01:00] <jrib> lee8oi: note the colors you could do in screen too :)
[01:01] <z30n1c> surely if the repo isnt already in you can add it in and use it though
[01:01] <sylphie> z30n1c \ there is one good side to manually starting X, which is that x windows video driver problems don't cripple your whole computer
[01:01] <lee8oi> jrib, but not by default, I have too many things to keep track of to learn all the ins and outs of every tool I use :)
[01:01] <jrib> lee8oi: *nod*
[01:01] <MichaelP> ubuntu 12.10 do we install video driver by hand now ?
[01:01] <jonascj> jrib: yes I download http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/patches/dmenu-4.5-xft.diff and http://dl.suckless.org/tools/dmenu-4.5.tar.gz and run "patch p1 < dmenu-4.5-xft.diff" (after untaring and copying the patch into the dir)
[01:01] <komputes> MichaelP: In Software Sources
[01:01] <lee8oi> jrib, defaults are my best friend. I've forced myself to grow accustomed to them :)
[01:02] <usr13> z30n1c: I manually start the Desktop Environment on my laptop.
[01:02] <ubuntuaddicted> i tried to uninstall mythweb and apache2 and now when I reinstall it, apache2 won't even start. I get this error: apache2: Syntax error on line 205 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.load
[01:02] <komputes> MichaelP: last tab should be Additional Drivers
[01:02] <z30n1c> getting the x org to work for me took me the best part of a month to crack.
[01:03] <sylphie> z30n1c \ at least you've cracked it now
[01:03] <usr13> z30n1c: xorg.conf is not necessary, (not on today's systems).
[01:03] <jrib> jonascj: yes, and?  That works
[01:03] <usr13> z30n1c: Things are easier now...
[01:03] <MichaelP> komputes, ok thanks
[01:03] <z30n1c> google only helps so far, nothing better than speaking to someone that understands how everything works to get your head round it.
[01:03] <blkadder> ubuntuaddicted: Did you reinstall php too?
[01:03] <lee8oi> jrib, whats the shortcut to background the terminal, usually in screen is ctrl+a,ctrl+d
[01:03] <ubuntuaddicted> blkadder, it appears to be already installed
[01:04] <usr13> z30n1c: distrowatch.com is a good place to check out the various distros.
[01:04] <komputes> MichaelP: welcome
[01:04] <ubuntuaddicted> php5 is already the newest version. it must be some config file messed up
[01:04] <sylphie> z30n1c \ in theory xorg.conf isn't necessary, when everything works right. xorg.conf is the quickest way to deal with video problems though
[01:04] <jrib> lee8oi: ctrl-b is the default escape character for tmux I think.  Try ctrl-b ?
[01:04] <z30n1c> even now xorg on one of my old laptops still myths me.
[01:04] <blkadder> ubuntuaddicted: Pastebin the second config file mentioned in the error.
[01:04] <somsip> lee8oi: ctrl-b d
[01:04] <lee8oi> jrib, nothing. I'll poke around in the docs
[01:05] <lee8oi> ahh hold on
[01:05] <MichaelP> Additional Drivers was not even installed
[01:05] <usr13> z30n1c: But you'll find that Ubuntu is the most readily supported, (in terms of finding info particular to Ubuntu and finding help with the various issues  you might run into).
[01:05] <ubuntuaddicted> blkadder, ok, one second
[01:05] <lee8oi> somsip, nope
[01:05] <jrib> lee8oi: ctrl-b ?    /should/ bring up a list of bindings
[01:05] <z30n1c> sylphie, the cli works fine but as soon as i hit startx the gui loads 4 x's bigger that the monitor
[01:05] <lee8oi> somsip, actuall yea, yer right
[01:05] <lee8oi> jrib, ctrl-b by itself does nothing
[01:05] <blkadder> ubuntuaddicted: And dpkg --get-selections | grep php
[01:05] <jrib> lee8oi: you forgot the "?" :)
[01:06] <jonascj> jrib: every hunk fails for me. Am I at the wrong directory level maybe?
[01:06] <lee8oi> jrib, but ctrl+b, d works
[01:06] <sylphie> z30n1c \ that's probably an xorg.conf setting you could fiddle with
[01:06] <jrib> jonascj: I don't know what directory you are in :)
[01:06] <jrib> jonascj: you should have a config.mk in the same directory
[01:07] <ubuntuaddicted> blkadder, oh, i can't. I reached my max pastebin posts for 24 hour. lol
[01:07] <z30n1c> im sure it is, no doubt the same issues i had with ubuntu 10.04 on a diff box. just not got round to having that battle.
[01:07] <jrib> lee8oi: in retrospect saying "ctrl-b ?" may have been clearer :)
[01:07] <BroUnicorn> So hey, I can't delete the linux swap partition off my macbook
[01:07] <usr13> z30n1c: There are apps like  xorgsetup  and nvidia-xconfig  that will write a xorg.conf file for you,  should you need one.
[01:07] <jrib> ubuntuaddicted: paste.ubuntu.com
[01:07] <blkadder> ubuntuaddicted: Private msg it to me.
[01:07] <z30n1c> oh?
[01:07] <magma> what's the command to do a trace on a website?
[01:07] <jonascj> jrib: how stupid am I, of course you do not know :/ i am in the directory containing the .diff file and the untared file (it contains a config.mk also)
[01:07] <z30n1c> never used anything like that.
[01:07] <usr13> magma: traceroute
[01:07] <sylphie> z30n1c \ another difference between distros is what window-manager they're pushing
[01:07] <z30n1c> apt-get grab it?
[01:08] <lee8oi> jrib, tmux is nice. I think I'm sold :)
[01:08] <usr13> z30n1c: grab what?
[01:08] <jrib> jonascj: should work, I just tried it here.  Pastebin all the lines you see in your terminal I guess
[01:08] <ubuntuaddicted> blkadder, here
[01:08] <ubuntuaddicted> blkadder, here's the dpkg http://pastebin.com/rj5UXS7n
[01:08] <jrib> lee8oi: yes, and it's actively developed

[01:08] <z30n1c> the nvida auto setup script etc?
[01:08] <usr13> z30n1c: It comes with the Nvidia driver
[01:09] <jrib> jonascj: need to leave for a bit.  I'll be back in ~10 but others can probably help once you pastebin
[01:09] <ubuntuaddicted> blkadder, i messaged you privatly
[01:09] <ubuntuaddicted> jrib, thanks, does that somehow work from ssh?
[01:09] <magma> usr13: why it is not installed by default?
[01:10] <jonascj> jrib: np - this is the paste: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1543192
[01:10] <jrib> ubuntuaddicted: pastebinit has some pastebin options I believe
[01:10] <jrib> !pastebinit | ubuntuaddicted
[01:10] <ubottu> ubuntuaddicted: pastebinit is the command-line equivalent of !pastebin - Command output, or other text can be redirected to pastebinit, which then reports an URL containing the output - To use pastebinit, install the « pastebinit » package from a package manager - Simple usage: command | pastebinit -b http://paste.ubuntu.com
[01:11] <jrib> jonascj: start over from before you untarred and pastebin again
[01:11] <BroUnicorn> Does anyone know why I'm unable to delete the linux swap partition from my mac using disk utility?
[01:12] <jrib> jonascj: never mind.  You used "p1" instead of "-p1"
[01:12] <sylphie> BroUnicorn \ what's the error message say?
[01:12] <ubuntuaddicted> jrib, i know that, BUT my max paste limit is reached for 24 hours so I was wondering if pastebinit worked for ubuntu.pastebin
[01:12] <usr13> magma: The Nvidia driver?  Why is it not installed by default?  Because of the opensource driver, (that works quite well), and because Nvidia's driver belong to Nvidia, (not Ubuntu).
[01:12] <z30n1c> BroUnicorn, you tried booting from a live distro cd?
[01:12] <BroUnicorn> z30n1c: You mean an ubuntu cd?
[01:12] <magma> usr13: the traceroute command
[01:12] <jrib> ubuntuaddicted: sure, see its man page
[01:12] <usr13> magma: Oh, I dono
[01:13] <BroUnicorn> z30n1c: I haven't tried using the ubuntu disks app, no
[01:13] <sylphie> BroUnicorn \ what's the error message say?
[01:13] <AceFace> hello all
[01:13] <jonascj> jrib: om*g thank you. That dash have been missing the whole 30 minutes I've been at this
[01:14] <BroUnicorn> sylphie: There isn't one. It just won't delete from the disk utility app on Mac. BTW: I will be done pestering this chat with questions soon. I had to delete ubuntu from my mac so I could install the free Windows 8 OS my University gave me, then I'm going to reinstall ubuntu and be done with all of this mess.
[01:15] <sylphie> BroUnicorn \ if you reinstall win 8, maybe you can reinstall it so that it doesn't use up all the disk space in the first place, so there will be so free space without resizing
[01:16] <jrib> jonascj: it happens :)
[01:17] <sylphie> BroUnicorn \ just a guess but maybe mac disk utils won't delete it because it's not a partition OS X knows anything about?

[01:20] <Pici> ccrnp: just start typing the name and press tab
[01:20] <Cyber_Akuma> The soundcard came out a few months ago, even the WINDOWS drivers were cd-only until they released an updated version for download like 2-3 weeks ago

[01:21] <Cyber_Akuma> ouch.. and I disabled the on-board sound card
[01:21] <Cyber_Akuma> What about my motherboard chipset then
[01:21] <Cyber_Akuma> I am guessing I am out of luck for the built-in wifi and bluetooth support?
[01:22] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ well, what kind of onboard sound was it?
[01:22] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ no, you're inluxk for wifi and bluetooth
[01:22] <Cyber_Akuma> realtek, but I disabled it because its primarly a windows machine and I use my soundblaster for sound
[01:22] <sylphie> wifi is well supported and so is bluetooth
[01:22] <Cyber_Akuma> didn't want anything to use the on-board audio
[01:23] <Cyber_Akuma> Though my gpu has an audio card on it too so theres also that issue...
=== bigbang is now known as krux
[01:23] <Tex_Nick> ccrnp : sorry i misunderstood your question ... but now you see how that works :)
[01:23] <Cyber_Akuma> but nvidia has drivers for my video cards, and lsi has drivers for my raid card
[01:23] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ realtek audio is supported
[01:23] <Cyber_Akuma> so those won't be a problem at least
[01:23] <Cyber_Akuma> I know, but my sound card is a sound blaster, I disabled the on-board realtek

[01:24] <datakid23> Hi, I"m having weird apt-get issues regarding a missing kernel image. It's a kernel from a while ago though - the issue happened as a result of having to move /boot (initial partition too small) coupled with updates that failed due to power failure

[01:25] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ give it a try, it might be supported if it's based on a pre-existing chipset
[01:25] <datakid23> anyone know where I might find that boot image online? I've tried apt-get clean/remove/update etc
[01:26] <datakid23> I think I just need the image and I'll pop it in place
[01:26] <Cyber_Akuma> the core is, dunno abotu the rest of the card
[01:26] <Cyber_Akuma> what about my motherboard then?
[01:26] <MichaelP> just installed ati driver in 12.10... i have no panel or sidebar now
[01:26] <AceFace> i have a question. im reading this document: http://goo.gl/Mddr5 , and i am specifically looking at this snippet: http://goo.gl/QK4GF , and i am getting this error: http://goo.gl/U8Bjh , i am trying to set up ejabberd in a cluster and the docs say to "On second run the following command as the ejabberd daemon user, in the working directory of ejabberd" but i dont quite know how to do this. Ive tried "sudo -u ejabberd command" but it produces and err
[01:26] <Cyber_Akuma> Also, if I use a livecd, can I install the drivers (obviosly in ram so it won't be permanent) so I can see if they work first? Or would I need to reboot, thus wiping out the drivers
[01:27] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ yes, you can run the live cd to see how all your devices detect before installing
[01:28] <desti> http://www.petitiononline.com/petitions/Linflix/signatures
[01:30] <Cyber_Akuma> sylphie: i menat installing drivers that aren't included on the livecd, or possibly not even in the repos
[01:31] <Cyber_Akuma> espeially for the motherboard chipset or gpu
=== Tiktalik is now known as `_`
[01:31] <Cyber_Akuma> Would I be able to do that on a livecd without any permanent changes?

[01:32] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ your sound might be a question, but the rest of it will probably have drivers.
[01:33] <somebodynew> exit
[01:34] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ most of the video cards in use have drivers. If you have an nvidia card, you get two drivers to choose from
[01:35] <sylphie> Cyber_Akuma \ I'd suggest (personally) the opensource "nouveau" driver instead of the proprietary "nvidia" driver

[01:40] <jambeedrum> where does the courier mail server keeps its man pages, anyone helping?
[01:42] <igor_> hello
[01:42] <sylphie> here's a starting place http://www.courier-mta.org/FAQ.html
[01:42] <jambeedrum> ok ty
[01:42] <igor_> i have a question about pendrive linux.
[01:43] <Tex_Nick> !details | igor
[01:43] <ubottu> igor: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[01:43] <igor_> i have never used a pendrive linux.  i have an uncle that is tired of getting virus' from windows so he wants tp try linux  i thought pendrive would be nice.
[01:43] <igor_> oik. sorry
[01:44] <igor_> what is the drawbacks of using a boota\ble form if linux
[01:45] <sylphie> If you wnt to install linux to an external pendrive, try to make sure it's a mechanical drive and not a ssd. all the writes to a ssd shorten it's life
[01:46] <igor_> how would i know the difference?  are common drives mechanical?
[01:46] <escott> igor_, all pendrive are ssds
[01:46] <igor_> ok. i though so.
[01:47] <sylphie> right now, ssd drives are becoming very popular, the older ones were micro-mechanical
[01:47] <igor_> so it would be ok to use to just try out linux for maybe a month?
[01:47] <sylphie> maybe
[01:48] <sylphie> it would work
[01:48] <igor_> yea. he just wants to try it out.
[01:49] <sylphie> a second external drive is the safest way to try linux
[01:49] <igor_> i was wondering if their was any other drawbacks to it. like ...security, program installs?
[01:49] <blkadder> Please practice safe Linuxing.
[01:50] <AceFace> lol
[01:50] <igor_> lol
[01:50] <sylphie> igor_ \ when you boot to the pendrive, all the program install will go to the pendrive
[01:51] <igor_> cool. can i use a different username and password withit also? will it save to it?
[01:52] <escott> igor_, there is essentially no security benefit to usernames/passwords for installs to removable disks, but yes you can
[01:53] <igor_> it will run much slower cause its running from usb?
[01:53] <escott> igor_, mixed.
[01:53] <sylphie> ssds usually run very fast
[01:53] <igor_> but in usb 2.0?
[01:54] <sylphie> usb 2.0 has a theoretical max spe3ed of 60 mb/sec
[01:54] <escott> igor_, usb flash disks are slow to write (think about all the times you sit there while the light flashes before you can eject), but reads are fast
[01:54] <gassed> I am a linux novice, anyone here point me in the direction of a tutorial to get VNC working on Ubuntu 12.04LTS
[01:55] <igor_> ok thanks
[01:55] <sylphie> igor_
[01:55] <sylphie> if you want to spend a little extra money, you can get an external usb hdd enclosure that uses a standard hdd
[01:56] <blkadder> !vnc
[01:56] <ubottu> VNC is a protocol for remote desktop. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNCOverSSH describes how to use it securely.  It works best over fast connections, otherwise look at !FreeNX
[01:58] <igor_> yea.  i was trying to be cheap about it.  he is a pc noob. and i didnt want to go and install it to his pc right away and change all the boot configs and all.
[01:59] <sylphie> if it's on a second gdd, there do not need to be any changes to the windows configs
[01:59] <Tex_Nick> igor : i've been using usb sata dock for several years now ... you can swap drives out easily ... they work great ... http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&DEPA=0&Order=BESTMATCH&N=-1&isNodeId=1&Description=usb3+sata+dock&x=0&y=0
[02:00] <sylphie> and if they don't like linux, they can still use the second drive for backups
[02:00] <Mathrys83> hmmm my linux side isnt recognizing any other the other partions
[02:02] <Tex_Nick> igor : problem with usb mechanical drives is that ac pi won't spin down the drive :(
[02:02] <Tex_Nick> acpi*
[02:02] <igor_> cool. thanks for the input.  so linux would run fine from a sata dock? linux for me runs much faster and smoother than windows on my multi boot pc
[02:03] <AceFace> can someone help me interpret some documentation?
[02:03] <vifanq> UDev doesn't mount external drives to /media automatically?
[02:03] <igor_> ok. so if he liked it, it would be advisable to just install to the main HDD?
[02:04] <escott> vifanq, udev never did the mounting. udisks does
[02:04] <escott> AceFace, only if you ask
[02:04] <escott> Mathrys83, and?
[02:04] <vifanq> escott: should I install udisks, or udisks2 ?
[02:05] <jgspratt> Hello.  I have this problem with DHCPD on ubuntu 10.04: http://hastebin.com/caxipaqeru.vhdl
[02:05] <AceFace> im looking at step 2 (aka 4.2.2) here: http://www.ejabberd.im/files/doc/guide.html#htoc28 and i dont know how to "run under ejabberd"
[02:05] <sylphie> igor_ \ it's always better to keep windows and linux on different drives
[02:05] <AceFace> does this mean under the user ejabberd?
[02:05] <ak> Hello.Is there a way to connect to a wifi throught wlan0 and use it same time to create an AP on the same card?Thanks in advance!
[02:05] <jgspratt> how can I fix this problem?
[02:05] <jgspratt> what does it mean that it doesn't have a subnet configured?
[02:05] <escott> ak, not without specialized hardware support
[02:05] <dr_willis> AceFace: run as the ejabberd user. yes
[02:06] <jambeedrum> sylphie: are you shure the question is there? can i just type "man courier" ?
[02:06] <jgspratt> I clearly configured a subnet: subnet 10.25.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 {
[02:06] <Mathrys83> i dunno im lost i live updated to 12.04 and now i cant see my other drives and cant get back to windows and what not
[02:06] <jgspratt> That was line 16 of the paste.
[02:06] <escott> vifanq, both? just install ubuntu-desktop
[02:06] <ak> escott , meaning?
[02:06] <AceFace> dr_willis: does this mean i use "sudo -u ejabber COMMAND" ?
[02:06] <igor_> ok. would 2 internal sata's be the thing to do?
[02:06] <jgspratt> Somehow, I need the dhcp server to start working soon so that I can get PXE boot working on this.
[02:06] <sylphie> jambeedrum \ at the top of that page was a link the courier mail server wiki which functions like man pages
[02:07] <dr_willis> AceFace:  or use su. or omthing like that command
[02:07] <ubuntuaddicted> blkadder, are you there?
[02:07] <ubuntuaddicted> for some reason my apache2 isn't starting after I restarted my computer
[02:07] <AceFace> dr_willis: i try that, and i get this error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1543220/
[02:08] <sylphie> igor_ \ that would be the best way, if he really liked linux. but it would involve some hardware installation
[02:08] <ubuntuaddicted> something is already binding to port 80 so apache2 doesn't start. what is nginx?
[02:09] <ubuntuaddicted> i don't even recall installing nginx
[02:09] <TheLordOfTime> ubuntuaddicted, nginx is a different webserver.
[02:09] <ubuntuaddicted> TheLordOfTime, what could have possibly installed it?
[02:09] <TheLordOfTime> ubuntuaddicted, sudo apt-get remove nginx nginx-light nginx-full
[02:09] <escott> ak, if they were on the same channel there shouldn't be anything that would actually prevent what you are proposing, but to jump different channels would be a problem
[02:09] <TheLordOfTime> ubuntuaddicted, no idea
[02:10] <ubuntuaddicted> TheLordOfTime, that's just strange, now packages are just installing by themselves. lol
[02:10] <dr_willis> i imagine you installed it..
[02:10] <dr_willis> and dident notice
[02:11] <escott> ak, you really want some kind of hardware that can tune and transmit on two different channels at the same time
[02:11] <jgspratt> does dhcpd actually work on ubuntu?
[02:11] <ubuntuaddicted> dr_willis, unless it came with something else. maybe mythweb?
[02:11] <ubuntuaddicted> or when I installed php5?
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> ubuntuaddicted, php5 doesn't depend on nginx
[02:11] <dr_willis> ubuntuaddicted:  no idea. i dont use mythtv any more
[02:11] <TheLordOfTime> ubuntuaddicted, afaik nothing really depends on nginx.  except some customized ISOs.
[02:12] <igor_> it would require a grub loader then?
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> question" does Kubuntu get the LTS title?
[02:12] <sylphie> igor_ \ the grub loader would go on the second drive
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> my understanding was that was only Ubuntyu
[02:12] <TheLordOfTime> Ubuntu *
[02:12] <ubuntuaddicted> dr_willis, TheLordOfTime well, sudo apt-get remove nginx worked and now apache2 can start.
[02:13] <ubuntuaddicted> that was just weird
[02:13] <ak> What i was trying so long to do  was to connect to an open wifi on channel 11(succeded) , create an AP on the same channel (succeded) and connect throught my laptop to servers AP(failed).I ll keep trying then.Thanks for your time :D
[02:13] <sylphie> ak \ maybe ios you had a second wifi
[02:14] <sylphie> ak \ maybe if you had a second wifi  ...
[02:14] <igor_> so the windows drive stays virgin?
[02:14] <vifanq> Why ssh X11 forwarding might fail after a while? I ssh to ubuntu box from OSX. Running x11 app on ubuntu correctly forwards to OSX. But after like 1 hour, it reports "cannot open dispaly" error
[02:14] <sylphie> igor_ \ yes
[02:14] <igor_> grub loader goes on the linux drive by default?
[02:15] <sylphie> igor_ \ yes, if you config it that way
[02:15] <ak> unfortunatelly sylphie thats not an option for now,but yeah i guess it would be easyer that way
[02:15] <igor_> ok. so it requires some config?
[02:15] <dr_willis> igor_:sometimes the unstaller may default to the wrong hd. so always double check it
[02:15] <jgspratt> how can I fix dhcpd?
[02:16] <sylphie> igor_ \ what you would do is select the boot drive in the computer's system bios
[02:16] <dr_willis> i put grub on my ubuntu hd.
[02:17] <igor_> ok. so linux drive first with grub loader on it, the grub loader would giver the option of 2 OS's?
[02:17] <sylphie> gyre007 has a lot of peer problems, two nights running
[02:18] <sylphie> igor_ \ that is one way to do it
[02:18] <igor_> ok.  i run linux and 2 windows OS's off one drive what is bad about it?
[02:19] <sylphie> igor_ \ windows doesn't like to share
[02:20] <escott> igor_, nothing is wrong with that
[02:20] <igor_> yea. i had to re-install grub after i put W7 on it.
[02:20] <sylphie> igor_ \ and sometimes any linux makes mistakes that can effect everything on the drive
[02:20] <jgspratt> Does anyone have a workign dhcpd server on ubuntu?
[02:20] <igor_>  is it common?
[02:20] <Mathrys83> sylphie neither does ubuntu apparently i live upgraded to 12.04 and lost my other partitions some how, i can occasionly see my other windows drive, but have lost the ability to boot into windows or linuxmint
[02:21] <jgspratt> Does anyone have a working DHCPD on any version of Linux at all ever?
[02:21] <sylphie> igor_ \ see, that's why two drive are better than sharing
[02:22] <igor_> i would like second drive myself. i was thinking of a ssd for speed.  but know i hear bad things about them..
[02:23] <blkadder> Yes all that speed can be dangerous...
[02:23] <igor_> lol
[02:23] <Mathrys83> when i do sudo apt-get install grub it wants to remove this "grub-gfxpayload-lists grub-pc grub2-common" is this ok
[02:23] <TheLordOfTime> Mathrys83, sudo apt-get install grub2
[02:24] <TheLordOfTime> not grub
[02:24] <blkadder> igor_: Seriously most ssds are fine. I have a couple and they work great.
[02:24] <TheLordOfTime> grub is legacy grub, you want to use grub2
[02:24] <TheLordOfTime> usually.
[02:24] <jgspratt> How can I tell what config file my dhcpd is trying to use>?
=== halloween- is now known as halloween
[02:24] <Mathrys83> well no removal request that time
[02:24] <igor_> they are expensive.  what size would be good for linux install?
[02:25] <Tex_Nick> igor : i've probably missed some of your issues, as i understand it though you would like to provide safe easy dual system ... one method i use is ... with 2 drives ... install windows on one drive ... then ubuntu on another drive ... make sure grub goes on 2nd drive ... that way either drive will boot by itself if other drive is removed  ... because ubuntu doesn't overwrite mbr on windoze drive
[02:25] <blkadder> igor_: True but prices have dropped pretty dramatically.
[02:25] <limpc> hi. how do i install php 5.4.10 on ubuntu? the current version included in the ubuntu repos is 5.4.6 and has serious bugs
[02:26] <Mathrys83> how do i load grub2, grub2 says its missing grib
[02:26] <Mathrys83> grub
[02:26] <sylphie> limpc \ go to the php site, d/l your chosen source code, then build it
[02:26] <igor_> if i have ubuntu drive boot first with grub loader will it give me the option in grub loader to bott either OS?
[02:26] <limpc> ive tried compiling php 5.4.10 manually but it keeps failing on not finding libXpm.so, but I do have it and point to it.
[02:27] <TheLordOfTime> limpc, sudo apt-get build-dep php5 first
[02:27] <TheLordOfTime> limpc, first do `sudo apt-get build-dep php5`
[02:27] <TheLordOfTime> limpc, you need the build dependencies for php5, afaik they're the same between 5.3.x and 5.4.x
[02:27] <limpc> TheLordOfTime: thanks
[02:27] <TheLordOfTime> don't include the ` characters thouhg when you run that
[02:27] <limpc> is there a site with these instructions?
[02:27] <subcool> Hey- question. - I just gparted and created a new partition- but for some reason - when it mounts, it mounts as ROOT. I have chown user /folder - and now its allows user/root -???
[02:27] <sylphie> limpc \ the first thing you'd you is "sh configure"
[02:28] <Tex_Nick> igor : yes
[02:28] <limpc> sylphie: um im not THAT much of a noob.  thats where im running into the libXpm.so issue
[02:28] <sylphie> ok :)
[02:28] <ncm> does anyone know how to set up a sub domain in apache2?
[02:29] <limpc> though, thanks to ubuntu repos, its been a long time since ive had to manually compile anything :P
[02:29] <sylphie> limpc \ it's probably just not finding it *where* it's expecting it
[02:29] <TheLordOfTime> limpc, as i said, install the build deps, those errors should mostly disappear
[02:29] <igor_> thanks everybody.
[02:30] <limpc> sylphie: i'm pointing it to the location its at
[02:30] <limpc> TheLordOfTime: nope still same issue :/
[02:30] <TheLordOfTime> limpc, which ubuntu are you on?
=== justinj is now known as jcj
[02:31] <blkadder> limpc: Hpw are you pointing it?
[02:31] <blkadder> err how
[02:31] <Tex_Nick> igor : if you remove the ubuntu drive ... the windoze drive will still have it's mbr intact and boot ... if you remove the windoze drive ... ubuntu ( grub ) will still show the windoze boot option ... but it won't boot into because the win drive is no longer there
[02:31] <igor_> later
[02:32] <limpc> TheLordOfTime: im using mint actually which is basically a lighter version of xubuntu
[02:32] <limpc> blkadder: http://pastebin.com/WYEXNbpL
[02:32] <TheLordOfTime> erm...
[02:32] <sylphie> I think gyre is part of some bot net

[02:32] <ubottu> limpc: Linux Mint is not a supported derivative of Ubuntu. Please seek support in #linuxmint-help on irc.spotchat.org
[02:32] <TheLordOfTime> limpc, mint's not somehting we support, even a tiny bit, in this channel.
[02:32] <TheLordOfTime> limpc, so... yeah can't help you any further.
[02:32] <TheLordOfTime> (mint does... things... to the repositories when they base their stuff on ubuntu, so it makes it hard for us to help you fix things)
[02:32] <alles-wird-gut> hi, file -i tells me the file is charset=binary. I want to convert it to utf-8
[02:33] <igor_> ok. gotcha.
[02:33] <alles-wird-gut> but recode and iconv does't support it...
[02:34] <limpc> TheLordOfTime: what kind of things? I moved from ubuntu to mint because it still uses ubuntu repos (not separate repos), same kernel, same structure, same everything, just has a lighter XFCE and uses less memory than xubuntu
[02:34] <escott> alles-wird-gut, what is a binary charset?
[02:34] <blkadder> limpc: ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXpm.so.4 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libXpm.so
[02:34] <sylphie> limpc \ apparently it's not 100 percent build compativle
[02:35] <limpc> whats not compatible?
[02:35] <sylphie> limpc \ apparently the ubuntu libs so's aren't
[02:35] <alles-wird-gut> escott, file -i tells application/x-rar; charset=binary

[02:37] <escott> alles-wird-gut, the filename is not the file
[02:37] <sylphie> gyre007 \ stop logging in
[02:37] <escott> alles-wird-gut, iconv works on the file contents not the filename. just mv the file to a new name
[02:38] <alles-wird-gut> okay
[02:38] <sylphie> gyre007 \ stop logging in
[02:38] <sylphie> gyre007 \ stop it
[02:38] <blkadder> limpc: Hmm... dpk --get-selections | grep Xpm
[02:38] <sylphie> gyre007 \ stop it
[02:39] <blkadder> err dpkg...
[02:39] <limpc> sylphie: he's not here. thats an auto reconnect
[02:39] <limpc> blkadder: hmm nothing listed
[02:39] <blkadder> limpc: Well that could be a problem.
[02:39] <sylphie> if I were a channel mod
[02:40] <jrib> guess 24 hour is not enough :)
[02:40] <limpc> thats strange. how do i have the lib then?
[02:40] <blkadder> limpc: Well it may be installed by something else, not positive.
[02:40] <blkadder> The package might not have Xpm in the name...
[02:40] <limpc> oh its not Xpm its xpm in dpkg

[02:42] <cakeboss> Hey guys. I am trying to format an SD card to put ubuntu on it, using ubuntu. I am using terminal with the command, "mkdosfs". I bought a 32gb SD card, what should I format it as?
[02:42] <limpc> i wonder if its also looking for xpm but prints Xpm
[02:42] <limpc> the symlinks are for Xpm
[02:42] <escott> cakeboss, fat32
[02:42] <sylphie> jambeedrum \ you never said what your issue was, you just wanted to finding reading material about courier mail server
[02:42] <dr_willis> cakeboss:  you are setting it up to use as a live-cd-usb ? or a full normal insttall?
[02:42] <cub> hello
[02:42] <cub> i have a slight issue
[02:43] <cakeboss> escott: will I be able to use the rest of the SD card? I thought fat32 restricted hardrive's disk size or something
[02:43] <cakeboss> dr_willis: full normal install
[02:43] <cub> i am running ubuntu 10.04, just tried upgrading to 12.04 and a msg popped up saying that my graphics card may not work on upgrade
[02:43] <limpc> hmm nope that wasnt it.  created a symlink with a small x and it still errors looking for libXpm.so
[02:43] <dr_willis> cakeboss:  then you let the installer partio/format .
[02:43] <cub> "The support in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS for your Intel graphics hardware is limited and you may encounter problems after the upgrade." < the msg
[02:43] <escott> cakeboss, no
[02:43] <KylieBrooks> hi
[02:44] <KylieBrooks> um
[02:44] <cub> so idk if i should continue or not

[02:44] <jambeedrum> sylphie: its playng with a mail server, i choose courier because it has an atractive name

[02:44] <KylieBrooks> only firefox and kvirc are new software installed
[02:44] <KylieBrooks> what do i do
[02:45] <sylphie> jambeedrum \ are you have problems with courier?

[02:47] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ is the whole machine locked up? does the caps lock still work?
[02:47] <blkadder> limpc: Can you give me the last few lines of your config.log in the install dir?
[02:48] <KylieBrooks> sylphie: when it locks up sometimes caps lock works other times not
[02:48] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ then it sounds like a hardware driver problem

[02:51] <limpc> blkadder: http://pastebin.com/rKJPgsNm
[02:51] <KylieBrooks> sylphie: reads like intel
[02:51] <sylphie> cads \ you can upgrade, at your peril
[02:51] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ so obviously something in the intel video settings
[02:52] <blkadder> limpc: I am pretty certain it has something to do with feeding it the right place to look for the files.
[02:52] <cads> sylphie, is it very dangerous?
[02:52] <KylieBrooks> sylphie: where are these settings
[02:52] <KylieBrooks> cads: yeah ...
[02:53] <blkadder> Ahh
[02:53] <sylphie> cads \ a lot of people have negative upgrade expereinces, but some do fine
[02:53] <blkadder> limpc: Remove the /usr/lib from your --with-xpm-dir
[02:54] <limpc> the whole path?
[02:54] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ there was a command for generating an xorg.conf from your settings. it would tell you was those settings were
[02:54] <blkadder> No, just the /usr/lib portion.

[02:55] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ I'm not really sure about intel video, I don't have that
[02:56] <limpc> blkadder:  hm no dice :/ still couldnt find it
[02:56] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ another thing to check is how much shared system memory your video is set yo use
[02:56] <KylieBrooks> sylphie: how ...
=== beatsonline is now known as bestsr
[02:57] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ amount of shated memory would be in the system bios.
[02:57] <limpc> im confused as to why its not finding it though - the file IS there
=== bestsr is now known as bgstsr
[02:57] <blkadder> limpc: How about adding --with-libdir=x86_64-linux-gnu
[02:57] <sylphie> limpc \ are you sure you've got the right version of the xmp.so?
[02:58] <KylieBrooks> sylphie: i reduced resolution
[02:58] <kunji> I have a pretty recent install of 12.10 here, the machine seems to insist on blanking the screen if the machine is idle and when it is in that state one cpu core will go to 100%.  This is using an AMD A10 APU with the proprietary drivers that "get additional drivers" finds.  The brightness and lock setting for "Turn screen off when inactive for:" is set to Never, and in Power, "Suspend when inactive for" is set to Don't suspend.  So, I'm no
[02:58] <KylieBrooks> sylphie: hope it works

[02:59] <limpc> blkadder: do i remobe x86_64-linux-gnu from the libxpm option?
[02:59] <blkadder> Well try with it, and then try removing it completely
[02:59] <ErdMutter> How would I go about improving the battery life on my Macbook Pro 9,2 on 12.10?
[02:59] <blkadder> meaning remove the whole --with-xpm-dir bit
[03:00] <sylphie> KylieBrooks \ because linux doesn't do the best power management, so sometimes things can overheat
[03:00] <KylieBrooks> ah sylphie
[03:02] <limpc> blkadder: w00t, that worked.
[03:02] <blkadder> limpc: Which one?
[03:03] <blkadder> Sorry their config script seems to rely on a lot of vodoo.
[03:03] <blkadder> voodoo even.
[03:03] <sylphie> lots of voodoo in php
[03:04] <limpc> blkadder: removed the --with-xpm-dir entirely
[03:04] <blkadder> limpc: Gotcha.

[03:16] <blkadder> Tecan: In order to keep the time as accurate as possible.
[03:16] <dr_willis> so each pc is looking  to update its clock.
[03:16] <Tecan> yeah but why those servers
[03:16] <dr_willis> random time server perhaps
[03:17] <Tecan> should they be left running ?
[03:17] <dr_willis> if you dont want them - then disable them..  ntp is not installed by default on ubuntu.
[03:17] <sylphie> Tecan, because these days most people disable ntp, so any who wants to set their clock by ntp has to go looking, and they find you

[03:21] <dr_willis> Hilikus:  im not sure the iso9660 filesystem supports hard links. so i would say you would get 2 files
[03:21] <dr_willis> i think theres some iso options that might support them. but its been ages since i last dug into  burning fs options

[03:29] <dr_willis> CrazyZurfer:  so what IS the file exactly
[03:29] <sylphie> dr_willis; a lot depends on dvd disc quality
[03:29] <CrazyZurfer> dr_willis: it is a game (Need for speed hot persuit) It think is the disk image file
[03:29] <dr_willis> sylphie:  i just noticed when copying files back from the dvds i always seem to have an error ont he last file... so i quit filling them up as much. ;)
[03:30] <sylphie> dr_willis; I burn 3 for every archive, so in case of errors there can be a majority vote on what was correct
[03:30] <dr_willis> CrazyZurfer:     use 'file filename' to see what it is
[03:30] <CrazyZurfer> NFS3.bin: data
[03:31] <dr_willis> so it could be anything. ;)
[03:31] <sylphie> dr_willis; the error on the last file might have to do with using tao-mode instead of dao-mode
[03:31] <dr_willis> sylphie: yea - it was years ago i last did it and had the issue. i found all those old disks the other day in a box. ;)  but i tend to backu p to  redundant copies of USB hard drives now a days

[03:32] <IceCas> or maybe it's Furius ISO Mount
[03:32] <CrazyZurfer> IceCas: That's to mount it or extract it or execute it? :)
[03:33] <dr_willis> CrazyZurfer:  so its some pirated video game? you DONT execute disk image files
[03:33] <IceCas> It will mount it and then you can extract it
[03:33] <Rallias> Is there a way to reduce the size of a btrfs partition while it's mounted?
[03:33] <dr_willis> there are ways to mount disk image files
[03:33] <CrazyZurfer> dr_willis: i Know you don't execute them, but we don't know what it is... and is a veeery old video game and I want to run it with wine :)

[03:34] <dr_willis> CrazyZurfer:  if its part of a cue/bin  image file. you might need to convert it.. or try  the fuseiso or isofuse tool to mount it

The only things besides normal bootup should be mediatomb, firefox, pidgin, the system monitor itself, and transmission.
[03:35] <sylphie> dr_willis; I think you can a iso9660 mount with loopback
[03:35] <dr_willis> sylphie:  the file command dident recoginize it as an iso9660 however.
[03:36] <dr_willis> unless file may be confused. ;)

[03:40] <kunji> Tex_Nick: Yeah, that should be flash, most of the time shouldn't it?  It should be because I have some Firefox pages open that use flash.
[03:41] <dr_willis> flash is evil ;_

[03:41] <Tex_Nick> kunji : yeah , it's hogged my resourses so bad at times that i've just killed it
[03:41] <dr_willis> tekkbuzz:  i know its doable.. done it befor ages ago.

[03:42] <Tex_Nick> kunji : what dr_willis said :)
[03:42] <kunji> dr_willis: I won't disagree, but is there a known flash bug that drive usage of just one core to 100% only when the computer enters an idle state?  Or that flash makes it enter the idle state when it shouldn't be?
[03:42] <kunji> *drives
[03:42] <tekkbuzz> dr_willis, K thanks I play around with that a bit.
[03:43] <CrazyZurfer> IceCas & dr_willis: Thanks!! it worked!! :)
[03:43] <dr_willis> tekkbuzz:  paprefs to allow it. and pavucontroll. had to set auth off in paprefs  (or so my memoserv note says)
[03:43] <dr_willis> tekkbuzz:  then used the pulse tools to set the default server

[03:44] <kunji> Tex_Nick: I think you missed my original post, my computer idles, as in blanks the screen, despite that I have set this otherwise in the Power management and brightness settings, and when it is idling like that  is the only time the core is spiking like that, it goes right back down if I so much as wiggle the mouse.
[03:44] <tekkbuzz> dr_willis: Cool!
[03:45] <kunji> Tex_Nick: I only even know it was high because of the cpu history graph in the system monitor.

[03:55] <tekkbuzz> Gyro54: I got one mine works fine.
[03:55] <dr_willis> Gyro54:  what sor tof listing/site you  mean?
[03:55] <dr_willis> about evvery keyboard these days are media keyboards
[03:56] <dr_willis> Logitech keyboards have that universial dongle that lets it use  one dongle for mouse and keyboard.. actually it can work with several mice/keyboards for the  same dongle..
[03:57] <Gyro54> dr_willis: linuxhcl.com, linuxhardware etc..
[03:57] <dr_willis> main issue with them - is logitech  dosent have a paring tool for linux
[03:57] <dr_willis> Gyro54:  most likelybecause keybaords are very standard.. so no one bothers to  make a list
[03:58] <tekkbuzz> Gyro54: I got IOGear model: GKM561R and it works!
[03:58] <dr_willis> i must havve 30 differnt  keyboards from over the years..  and never had one not work..  some Special keys may be issues with some old ones..

[04:22] <kunji> Tex_Nick: Probably, but I can't tell 100% for certain, as I haven't had the issue reoccur on starting flash again, so I haven't been able to see it killing flash always fixes it.

[04:25] <kunji> tripelb: Yeah, without the network connection, it will install anyway, I believe it just asks to confirm that you want to install it without having the connection and then moves on.  It won't be able to install update during the installation that way though, so you should install updates first thing once it is connected.

=== cptmashek is now known as tenach
[04:27] <kunji> Tex_Nick: The 100% usage isn't what's worrying me, that I've seen, but that the screens go blank, like if your power settings were set to blank the screen after 1 minute of inactivity, only my setting are set quite explicitly so they should always stay on.
[04:28] <Gyro54> TheKing: I know other wont agree but I would go Xubuntu. It works fine on that type of machine.
[04:28] <Tex_Nick> kunji : strange that only one core goes wild, cause it has seemed that load balancing on this apu has been rather symetrical for normal operation
[04:28] <kunji> Tex_Nick: And I only see that usage when the screens are off like that, I would liken it to a malware that is trying to hide it's compute from you by doing when your screens are supposedly off.
[04:29] <kunji> Yeah, I mean, I don't have one core spike like that if I say, play a 1080p flash video.
[04:30] <Hilikus> is there any way to create UDF dvds in brasero? the documentation sucks

[04:31] <TheKing> Gyro54: Thanks. I have a friend who was kind of iffy about xubuntu. So that helps a lot
[04:31] <kunji> Tex_Nick: Right, I mean, sure I've had plenty of problems with flash running up cpu, but I didn't think it would be flash for this because of the conditions the spike occurs under, and that those conditions shouldn't be happening to begin with.

[04:47] <kunji> Tex_Nick: No problem, I'm frequently back here for one thing or another.
[04:48] <kunji> For instance I also appear to be suffering from this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubuntu-meta/+bug/1072518  on a different machine, but if there was a solution yet it would probably have been fixed (as it is a confirmed bug).
[04:48] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1072518 in ubuntu-meta (Ubuntu) "Restarting network crashes (apparently) the desktop manager" [Undecided,Confirmed]
[04:52] <Sgt_Shultz> is it flash or java, java is the colinder ...depends on who requests i think, killed my video issues, by using videodownloader  addon in firefox, & watching after download

[04:52] <Tex_Nick> lol ... i swear ... ubottu can't be a bot ... he/she is sentient !!! :-)
[04:52] <SierraAR> Is there a way to make the grub boot menu always appear, even if ubuntu is the only installed os?
[04:53] <kunji> SierraAR: Yes, there is, the documentation should be pretty easy to find with a google search, let me know if you can't find it and I'll dig it out.
[04:56] <SierraAR> kunji: Most of the results were 'How do I remove the menu in a dual boot' which weren't helping me much, but I just found an article xD
[04:56] <SierraAR> Thanks
[04:56] <kunji> SierraAR: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Setup#Configuring_GRUB_2
[04:56] <SierraAR> Ah that's even better, thanks again
[04:57] <kunji> SierraAR: No problem, just ask if you get stuck.
[04:57] <Modernmyth> is there a way to see if a package is being used by another package? for some reason I have libmysqlclient18:i386 installed instead of the amd64.
[04:57] <Modernmyth> want to make sure I dont break anything.
[04:59] <kunji> Modernmyth: Hmm, if it is being used, or if it is actually listed as a dependency by another package?  The later can be done using dpkg I believe, though my memory fails me on what the command would be, maybe read the dpkg manual?
[05:01] <SierraAR> Do believe I'd got it. Will have to check on my next reboot
[05:02] <kunji> Modernmyth: A package could make use of another, but not actually need it, or some such, due to manual configuration (like maybe some php code on a server needs to use curl, but curl is not actually needed by the php packages).
[05:04] <xob> difference between ubuntu and lubuntu?
[05:05] <xob> confusing wht should i install on my netbook ubuntu or lubuntu?
[05:05] <orb> hallo.
[05:05] <logidot> xob: lubuntu is lighter than ubuntu
[05:05] <kunji> xob: The desktop manager, Ubuntu uses Unity, Lubuntu uses LXDE, also note Xubuntu uses XFCE.
[05:05] <mysteriousdarren> xob: plus its awesome!
[05:05] <kunji> xob: and Kubuntu uses KDE
[05:06] <xob> what XFSE stands for
[05:06] <logidot>  xob in my netbook with intel atom n270 1.6 ghz i use lubuntu and it does the job pretty good
[05:06] <xob> mysteriousdarren: what is awesome ub or lu
[05:06] <kunji> xob: http://www.xfce.org/
[05:07] <Sgt_Shultz> xfse = nice, using xubuntu
[05:07] <xob> logidot: does this support hd movies?
[05:07] <logidot>    xob xfce is a desktop environment like kde,mate etc
[05:07] <kunji> xob: But come to think of it, I'm not sure what the letter actually stand for, maybe the wikipedia page will say.
[05:07] <kunji> *letters
[05:07] <xob> kunji: i will check it thanx
[05:08] <tekkbuzz> Modernmyth: apt-cache depends pkg...    -- depends shows a listing of each dependency a package has and all the possible other packages that can fulfill that dependency.
[05:08] <mysteriousdarren> xob: lubuntu
[05:09] <xob> mysteriousdarren: thanx
[05:09] <argiopeweb> I need to restart an upstart job from a script running as a non-privileged user. What's the best way to do that?
[05:09] <mysteriousdarren> xob: I have one like logidot, after removing extra it runs pretty quick. Plus extra ram and  a ssd doesn't hurt
[05:09] <mysteriousdarren> *extra programs
[05:10] <xob> mysteriousdarren: wht about ubuntu if i remove extras from ubuntu wht u think it works good then?
[05:11] <mysteriousdarren> xob: on what hardware? I am all for speed, if you have the hardware i run vanilla ubuntu
[05:11] <mysteriousdarren> with a couple things changed
[05:11] <OnVar> xob: I used plain ubuntu and it worked fine for me. (I have the same computer stats as logidot)

[05:11] <KI4RO> Anyone know where the latest version (2.1.3) of gtkpod is?
[05:11] <logidot>  OnVar how much ram?
[05:12] <xob> mysteriousdarren:  i have intel atom with 2gb ram and 320gb hd
[05:12] <mysteriousdarren> mahnoon: who was that for?
[05:12] <OnVar> logidot: 1GB
[05:12] <tekkbuzz> <Modernmyth> try: apt-cache depends libmysqlclient18
[05:12] <mysteriousdarren> xob: should work fine
[05:12] <logidot> OnVar: it's the acer aspire d250?
[05:12] <OnVar> logidot: (I ended up changing to Gnome and then Xmonad, though)
[05:12] <kunji> xob: Oh, you were asking about HD movies, that depends mostly on what hardware you're running Ubuntu on, not as much on which desktop manager, but if your hardware strains playing HD, then you would be best off with Lubuntu in my opinion.
[05:13] <mysteriousdarren> xob: I agree with kunji
[05:13] <xob> currently i am using ubuntu 12.10 and it play well .mkv formats
[05:13] <mysteriousdarren> xob: using what?
[05:13] <mysteriousdarren> vlc?
[05:13] <OnVar> logidot: No. It's a gateway.
[05:14] <xob> mysteriousdarren: mplayer
[05:14] <kunji> xob: It will do HD fine from the hard drive, it will probably struggle to do 1080p flash video though, 720 should be pretty smooth, I have a laptop with pretty similar specs.
[05:14] <logidot> OnVar: and you have intel atom n270 1.6 ghz?and you run ubuntu ?what version?
[05:14] <Modernmyth> tekkbuzz: Thanks ... Looks like it's pointing me in the right direction. Going to figrure out what I installed that wanted the mysql pkg
[05:14] <xob> kunji: which version ur using
[05:14] <mysteriousdarren> xob: I sometimes hook up my 32 inch lcd and watch hd movies on mine with lubuntu works great. I've had trouble with ubuntu doing that
[05:15] <kunji> xob: I'm actually using 12.04 standard Ubuntu.
[05:16] <xob> maybe i have to give lubuntu a try
[05:16] <tekkbuzz> Modernmyth: MySql is used sometimes by multible programs, it's just a powerfull database.
[05:16] <OnVar> logidot: It's 12.04. But I don't do well with fancy graphics anyways. I changed it to Xmonad eventually.
[05:16] <orb> what did you want to do with it, xob?
[05:17] <kunji> xob: Well that's how it started, but I run several desktop manager on it as appropriate, Unity, Unity-2d, gnome-panel (i.e., the Gnome 2 look), the Awesome WIndow Manager, I try a lot of different things.
[05:17] <kunji> *managers
[05:17] <xob> well i am using gnome-panel i hate unity
[05:17] <orb> compiz was good stuff.
[05:17] <kunji> xob: Sure, try out Lubuntu first, if it's not working out for you, then you can alway try something else.
[05:17] <Sgt_Shultz> xbuntu drives a 42" led Monitor/tv here, no probs
[05:18] <sk8trix> is there any driver for logitech c615 webcam for linux?
[05:18] <Tex_Nick> xob : i've seen here that xbmc handles hd video pretty well on 12.xx ... however it's hardware specific ... i'm running 12.12 with an average speed box and VLC plays 1280p like a charm
[05:18] <Modernmyth> tekkbuzz: I use it all the time .. just wondering what I installed that had a i386 dep
[05:18] <majnoon> <--has *buntu
[05:18] <kunji> orb: You can do compiz with Unity, but there are a fair number of inconsistencies you need to kind of hammer out/work around.
[05:18] <orb> sk8trix, is that some kind of nonstandard camera?
[05:18] <Sgt_Shultz> acer aspire dualcore 5733z

[05:19] <orb> yeah, i think i noticed that a while back, kunji
[05:19] <xob> Tex_Nick: i am running 12.10 but vlc does not play .mkv properly but mplayer does
[05:19] <dr_willis> hmm. mkv play here.
[05:20] <sylv> OMG am I actually in touch with humans?
[05:20] <kunji> Well, for media servers... if you've got 35$ USD, the Rasperry Pi works pretty awesome for XBMC, through omxplayer (designed to make good use of the graphics chip on the pi)

[05:20] <bk> I am having trouble being able to edit settings for the touchpad on my laptop, I have a Compaq Presario CQ62 running Lubuntu 12.10. Right now when I type and accidentally hit the touchpad it acts as if its a tap, or it scrolls when both palms hit it at the same time. In the settings there is something for KB/M but nothing that pertains to the touchpad. I
[05:20] <bk> installed gpointing-device-settings but it does not save when I change things. Any help is appreciated.
[05:21] <xob> dr_willis: yea i thinnk so
[05:21] <xob> may be its a codec prob
[05:21] <orb> holy crap, didn't notice how many people are in this channel. Closer to 2k than 1k, dr_willis
[05:21] <sylv> I could really do with some help please.  I don't understand all this technical stuff.  I have been trying to use Ubuntu and spent hours trying to access stuff
[05:21] <dr_willis> seen 3000 in  here on release day
[05:22] <kunji> dr_willis: though even then, there's not many codecs vlc will balk at, MSS2 and Apple Intermediate Codec?  Nothing else comes to mind.  I guess I don't think it plays .ape audio files.

[05:28] <Ben64> orb: theres no ethernet on a macbook?
[05:28] <orb> actually, no, i think i'll give up on that too. :>
[05:28] <Tex_Nick> Ben64 : i stand corrected ...  mkv is a container
[05:28] <Tex_Nick> ... sorry ;-)
[05:28] <orb> not on mine.

[05:28] <cub> okay i instaled ubuntu 12.04
[05:28] <cub> the friggin scrollbar is invisible
[05:28] <kunji> Tex_Nick: Yes indeed a very good container that the PS3 quite obnoxiously does not support.
[05:28] <cub> well it's there but all fancy
[05:29] <cub> how do i get a more normal looking gnome environment
[05:29] <cub> this looks like a cellphone gui
[05:29] <dr_willis> define normal. ;)
[05:29] <cub> l;ike
[05:29] <cub> old school windows 95 / gnome / kde
[05:29] <cub> a simple launcher/panel
[05:29] <kunji> cub: Like gnome 2?  You could install gnome-panel I think, could you confirm that dr_willis?
[05:29] <dr_willis> lubuntu has a nice old skool look.
[05:29] <dr_willis> !nounity
[05:29] <ubottu> Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic
[05:29] <orb> i thought gnome looked pretty decent.
[05:30] <Tex_Nick> lol kunji ;)
[05:30] <dr_willis> gnome2 had issues.. and its basicaly dead now
=== KaiSforza is now known as Tem^
[05:31] <dr_willis> the fallback mode was scheduled for removeal  - but i think its being kept for a while longer now
[05:31] <cub> its just a pain to find what programs im running
[05:31] <cub> normally they would be listed in the panel
[05:31] <cub> instead i have a dock bar or w/e they call it and have to figure out where it is :\
[05:31] <dr_willis> Hmm.. they all  are at the left side panel when i run stuff
[05:32] <cub> funny that before i installed, it said my graphics chip woudlnt be supported... well it worked still but im unhappy lol
[05:32] <sk8trix> webcam software for logitech for lenoic
[05:32] <cub> yeah but i have to right click to see multiple instances of one program
[05:32] <cub> like for example im running 3 or 4 chrome windows, and i have to right click and select from a preview of each.. seems unnecesary and slow
[05:32] <dr_willis> i just alt-tab around
[05:33] <kunji> dr_willis: I miss the stability, but I came in near the end of Gnome 2's life, not sure if it was always that way.  Unity is pretty stable on my desltops, but on my other machines there is always some part or another of it crashing, most recently the calendar...
[05:33] <tekkbuzz> cub: Try KDE  aka kubuntu
[05:33] <dr_willis> i  dont recall needing to right click in unity..
[05:33] <dr_willis> but ive been using gnome-shell lately
[05:34] <cub> well nvm not right click
[05:34] <cub> but it still takes me to that preview thing
[05:35] <kunji> I think the part that annoys me the most is that clicking the launcher's again does not have any minimize functionality, but I guess I'm not sure how that should work, since they stack windows from the same program.
[05:35] <dr_willis> the whole idea of minimizeing apps is sort of getting phased out.
[05:35] <dr_willis> I tend to just fullscreen everything
[05:35] <dr_willis> and then select /jump between them
[05:36] <Inside> question: I'm trying to figure out how to connect to a server that's running in ubunbtu which is running inside of virtual box... I can't seem to figure out how to tell if I configured the 'bridged networking' setting correctly or not <_<
[05:36] <kunji> I tend not to, because I like to see lots of smaller programs at once
[05:36] <dr_willis> Inside:  check its ip address. see if the ubuntu box can ping that ip address
[05:36] <orb> Inside, one of those will give it a real IP.
[05:37] <orb> I don't recall which.
[05:37] <Inside> hm
[05:37] <dr_willis> they should be able to ping each other..  if so. they are networked  ;)
[05:37] <dr_willis> if not.. they are NOTworked. ;)
[05:37] <Inside> hrm
[05:37] <orb> Just look at the IP - is it a natted IP not matching your normal network?
[05:37] <cub> is there any way to hide the dock thing to the left
[05:38] <Inside> okay, the server in ubuntu inside of virtual box says that its ip is 10.0.2.15.. and I can't ping that from the windows host that i'm on right now
[05:38] <cub> or to get the bar on top with the time to appear on the bottom
[05:38] <Inside> erm, not the server, ubuntu itself
[05:38] <dr_willis> theres an auto hide setting for the launcher
[05:38] <dr_willis> Youc an run other docks for the bottom if you  wanted
[05:38] <dr_willis> !dock
[05:38] <ubottu> Ubuntu includes several dock-like navigation bars. Some options are: avant-window-navigator, cairo-dock, docky (formerly part of gnome-do), stalonetray, simdock, kdocker, kooldock.
[05:39] <kunji> For instance, I want to have pidgin, system monitor, and say transmission all visible and I have the buddy list for pidgin underneath the irc chat.  So it would make sense for me to just minimize the irc chat as the fastest way to see the buddy list.  alt-tabbing is slow because I need to go through probably an average of 8 or so items and I need to pause on Pidgin and wait for it to expand the windows for pidgin (in Unity that is, if I bus
[05:40] <Sgt_Shultz> format the mac, use ubuntu....
[05:40] <Ginger26> Will Ubuntu Phone have an IRC support channel ?
[05:40] <dr_willis> Ginger26:  i imagine so..
[05:40] <dr_willis> if it ever becomes a reality
[05:41] <kunji> dr_willis: yeah, I do like cairo-dock, I install from scratch kind of often though, and configuring that every time is a bit obnoxious
[05:41] <orb> mac osx. :D
[05:41] <Ginger26> oh thats great thanks
[05:41] <dr_willis> some of these docks are... overzelous in their feature sets. ;)
[05:41] <kunji> Ginger26: It might just go in this one, not really sure.
=== vgambit` is now known as vgambit
[05:42] <kunji> Hmm, I probably wouldn't want them if they didn't have the features, but, at least for cairo-dock, it could use a bit more stability.
[05:43] <OnVar> I have a problem. My mouse hasn't been working lately. I've tried "modprobe -r psmouse; modprobe psmouse proto=imps" but that only causes it to work for about three seconds and then it goes kaput again.
[05:43] <OnVar> I suspect that it could be a hardware problem, but I have no way of checking.
[05:44] <OnVar> (I have a touchpad, not a mouse. Sorry.)
[05:46] <tekkbuzz> Speaking of docks; I always hated the way Unity separates the top of the window from the app.
[05:46] <dr_willis> tekkbuzz:  thats the global menu feature.. not a dock  feature. ;)
[05:47] <tekkbuzz> dr_willis: whatever it's called it's why I left Unity behind.
[05:47] <dr_willis> and its fairly easy to disable
[05:47] <kunji> dr_willis: that's not a feature :P
[05:47] <dr_willis> and can even be disabled on a per-app basis
[05:48] <kunji> Yeah, remember to do that extra bit for disabling it for firefox as well
[05:48] <dr_willis> i belive the global menu also  integerates with the HUD feature
[05:48] <dr_willis> which is one off the most overlooked and coolest features of unity
[05:49] <Sgt_Shultz> mac have docks, because they would make a good boat anchor if you filled them with cement ?
[05:49] <dr_willis> windowmaker hs a Warf
[05:49] <dr_willis> has a warf
[05:49] <kunji> windowmaker?  never heard of it

[05:50] <ubottu> Package windowmaker does not exist in quantal
[05:50] <tekkbuzz> can u elaborate on integerates with the HUD?

[05:50] <dr_willis> wmaker has some really neat features. but its a bit on the old skool side of things. ;)
[05:51] <dr_willis> a great many other window managers support the windowmaker 'warf' docklets. which are mini appps that run in the dock
[05:52] <tekkbuzz> I used to like the wmaker on my Fedora box, but haven't used it in a while.
[05:52] <kunji> dr_willis: Hmm, the look reminds me Haiku
[05:52] <dr_willis> not like BeOS/Haiku at all. ;)
[05:53] <dr_willis> more like NextStep - but no one rembers that one either.. heh..
[05:53] <tekkbuzz> I do.. heh.
[05:53] <dr_willis> wmaker was supposed to have some support libs/features to make  cross platform apps with os-x easier also  i recall.. but i dont code. so i dont recall the details
[05:53] <kunji> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wmaker-0.80.2.png  well, the right click menu like that is what was looking similar.
[05:54] <dr_willis> beos had some really really neat features.. ;)
[05:54] <bsmith093> how do i recursively grep for any line that has http:// in it, and return those lines to a file?
[05:54] <dr_willis> but the gui wasent really much of them. but Unity is gaining some similer features
[05:55] <kunji> dr_willis: That's what I've heard, I've messed with the Haiku alpha's some, I'll probably look into it more if they finish it.

[05:56] <dr_willis> kunji:  i doubt if haiku ever gets finished. ;)
[05:56] <kunji> One can hope
[05:58] <orb> you can do grep */dir
[05:58] <bsmith093> dr_willis: I cat-ed all the files i needed to search into nice large chunks of text, now i just want to find and save to a file, every single line that has http:// in it, this is a rare thing for these files, and i can always sort the results later
[05:58] <dr_willis> so you  dont really need recursive searching of dirs...
[05:59] <dr_willis> grep pattern file  > output.txt
[05:59] <dr_willis> or am i backwards.. ;)
[05:59] <tekkbuzz> bsmith093: cat file* | grep -r http:// > file
[05:59] <orb> are you wanting to have http start a new line?
[06:00] <orb> or trigger the start of a new line so the output will have http all along the left side?
[06:00] <bsmith093> orb yes, to the new line, each on its own line
[06:00] <dr_willis> each hit will be on its own line...
[06:01] <cub> how do i get the time panel on the bottom of the screen on unity
[06:01] <dr_willis> wont it. ;) it echos  the line it found.
[06:01] <Sgt_Shultz> maybe a doing a "find", then "piping" to a "grep"
[06:01] <orb> i believe you'll want to replace http with \nhttp
[06:01] <orb> using a sed command.
[06:01] <dr_willis> cub short answer - you  dont.  if you want a dock down there. you can use differnt docks for a panel
[06:01] <bsmith093> grep http:// * >> links this command works brilliantly , but one more thing, how do i get grep to not print the filenames?
[06:02] <dr_willis> grep it again :) heh .. thats overkill
[06:02] <dr_willis> grep has an option for that i  belive
[06:02] <bsmith093> actually not a huge deal, but thanks
[06:02] <orb> so pipe your output from the grepping through this: sed 's/http/\nhttp/g'
[06:03] <bsmith093> one thing though, will grep complain if i use it recursively and there are spaces in the filename
[06:03] <dr_willis> spaces in filenames are often a bother.
[06:03] <dr_willis> this is one would use find, or xargs often
[06:03] <shortstraw8> This might be a forum question but does anyone use aptitude for installing pkgs? if so is it really that much better?
[06:03] <cub> damn
[06:03] <cub> ok thanks dr_jesus
[06:03] <cub> oops
[06:03] <dr_willis> shortstraw8:  its best to avoid aptitude
[06:03] <cub> dr_willis,
[06:03] <FloodBot1> cub: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[06:03] <cub> you've been very helpful
=== hsb is now known as Guest18349
[06:03] <TheLordOfTime> shortstraw8, aptitude doesn't work with multiarch avoid it
[06:03] <TheLordOfTime> shortstraw8, avoid aptitude and use apt-get.
[06:04] <TheLordOfTime> and related fucntions
[06:05] <shortstraw8> TheLordOfTime,  dr_willis  tahnk you! Just happened to stumble on it in searching.
[06:06] <dr_willis> aptitide has some neat features.. but unfortunatly itgs not surviveing the  changes made in the rest of the os very well
[06:06] <tekkbuzz> cub: you make like: Mint w/ Cinnamon
[06:07] <dr_willis> if you want an old skool type desktop - lubuntu works well
[06:07] <shortstraw8> TheLordOfTime,  dr_willis   Sorry again what about mutt?
[06:07] <tekkbuzz> cub: that's Ubuntu Mint.
[06:07] <dr_willis> shortstraw8:  the  email client? do you  need a console based email client?
[06:08] <dr_willis> Mint is not ubuntu. ;)
=== gvim is now known as Guest49318
[06:08] <tekkbuzz> No?
[06:08] <dr_willis> its not supported here.. and neither is cinnamon
[06:08] <dr_willis> mint has its own shpport channale
[06:09] <tekkbuzz> it's a derivative built on Ubuntu.
[06:09] <dr_willis> tekkbuzz:  that means its not ubuntu.
[06:09] <the_dark_knight> Hi, which is the best python api doc generator? Couldn't join the #python channel. please help
[06:09] <dr_willis> the_dark_knight:  you may need to regiester your  nick to join many  channels.

[06:10] <cub> ok
[06:10] <kunji> Just as Ubuntu is built on Debian, somehow I don't think the Debian folks get bothered by very many Ubuntu support questions.
[06:10] <Tex_Nick> cub : unity just doesn't support placing the clock at the bottem of the screen ... you might look at cairo-dock desktop enviornment ... it might give you a clock down there
[06:10] <cub> amazingly im able to run a nice looking gui on here .... cant run win7 or 8 but can run this heh
[06:10] <cub> cairo-dock.. ok
[06:10] <dr_willis> I imagine #debian  refers all ubuntu questions here. ;)
[06:11] <kunji> cub: or cairo-clock, I missed the beginning of that conversation though
[06:11] <cub> ok]
[06:11] <tekkbuzz> dr_willis: http://www.linuxmint.com/about.php , based on "Based on Debian and Ubuntu"
[06:12] <kunji> dr_willis: I'm sure they do, I just don't think they get very many of them, they're probably all asking here already
[06:12] <dr_willis> tekkbuzz:  yes.  its based on.. tht does not make it 'ubuntu'
[06:12] <TheLordOfTime> tekkbuzz, mint is not a supported derivative of ubuntu.  It may be based on ubuntu but its not Ubuntu.  Just like Ubuntu is based off of Debian, but is not Debian.
[06:12] <dr_willis> Puppylinux has a very radical   disrto that uses ubuntu repos... its not supported here either. ;)
[06:12] <TheLordOfTime> yep
[06:13] <kunji> tekkbuzz: After all, this isn't "Debian Ubuntu"
[06:13] <dr_willis> neither is the 1000+ other ubuntu variants
[06:13] <dr_willis> Lubuntu,kubuntu,xubuntu,ubuntu, and i think 1 or 2 ithers are consuiderd official
[06:14] <kunji> If you can't get it from ubuntu.com I'm pretty sure support doesn't come from here.
[06:14] <tekkbuzz> I Never said it was supported here, I was merely making a sugestion for someone having a problem learning and Mint is easy and the apps all install to it just fine.
[06:14] <dr_willis> You called it 'ubuntu mint' and  thats incorrect.
[06:15] <tekkbuzz> It's based on Ubuntu and that is correct.
=== the_dark_knight is now known as hussain
[06:15] <dr_willis> the name is not 'ubuntu mint'
[06:16] <tekkbuzz> it's Linux Mint
=== hussain is now known as harvey_dent
[06:16] <tekkbuzz> based on Ubuntu based on linux.
[06:16] <dr_willis> and linux was based on minix
[06:16] <karmakosmikk> Hello, how to install tar.gz? I am trying to run dwarf fortress
[06:16] <tekkbuzz> and minux based on unix
[06:16] <dr_willis> karmakosmikk:  normally you extract the files and look at the extrated files
[06:17] <dr_willis> there shold be a readme, and perhaps some executables to run
[06:17] <kunji> tekkbuzz: That's another can of worms, that's a different meaning of based on, Linux is actually part of Ubuntu, now you're talking the foundation meaning of base instead of the derivative work sort of meaning.
[06:18] <kunji> tekkbuzz: Also, don't you mean minix?  The Tannenbaum one, or is this something else I haven't heard of.
[06:18] <dr_willis> karmakosmikk:  that a humble bundle game?
[06:18] <tekkbuzz> I was only trying to help cub, get a hold on Linux. Want me to say sorry, im sorry for saying Mint.
[06:18] <karmakosmikk> no, it is free
[06:18] <karmakosmikk> in their netsite
[06:19] <dr_willis> karmakosmikk:  normal method if its precompiled. extract files to a directory, cd to the dir.. run the game
[06:19] <kunji> tekkbuzz: Nah, an apology isn't necessary, we know you were trying to help, it's just that what you were saying wasn't really correct so we wanted to make sure it was ironed out, all clear.
[06:20] <diverdude> Hello, I have a directory with around 800.000 images. Whenever i do eog /path/to/image/in/imagedir.png it takes a long time to open. Could that be due to the large amount of images in the directory?
[06:20] <dr_willis> diverdude:  could be its generting some previews or somthing
[06:20] <kunji> diverdude: Possible, but more likely, how big is the png?
[06:21] <diverdude> kunji, 2.3MB
[06:21] <kunji> diverdude: If  you move one to a different directory, does it take just as long to open?
[06:21] <diverdude> kunji, ah good idea
[06:22] <diverdude> kunji, no its way faster
[06:22] <diverdude> in different dir
[06:22] <kunji> diverdude: Well, then I guess it does have something to do with it, I guess I just thought finding the file would have been faster.
[06:24] <diverdude> my images are named "image[somenumber].png", like: "image1292939.png".  Is there an easy way to copy all images image[somenumber].png to image[somelargernumber].png to a dir?
[06:25] <dr_willis> diverdude:  theres numerout bulk rename tools -    i often use qmv, for a cli tool. but its a bit overkill for that
[06:25] <dr_willis> !info rename-utils
[06:25] <ubottu> Package rename-utils does not exist in quantal
[06:25] <dr_willis> !info renameutils
[06:25] <ubottu> renameutils (source: renameutils): Programs to make file renaming easier. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.12.0-1 (quantal), package size 123 kB, installed size 645 kB
[06:25] <diverdude> dr_willis, hmm i dont want to rename anything. I just want to copy a set of files to another directory
[06:26] <dr_willis> diverdude:   you wanted to change the name form what i saw
[06:26] <diverdude> dr_willis, no i want to copy X images to another directory
[06:27] <dr_willis> image9somenumber0.png to image(somebiggerniumber).  you mean amove RANGE  of files
[06:27] <diverdude> dr_willis, copy all images in the range image[somenumber].png to image[somelargernumber].png to another directory
[06:27] <dr_willis> ;)
[06:27] <dr_willis> bash supports regular exporessions for that
[06:27] <diverdude> yes
[06:28] <dr_willis> test regular expressions with echo first.. and if you do to  many at a time. you can fill up the bash command buffer.
[06:28] <dr_willis> how large a range?
[06:28] <dr_willis> it may be better to use a loop.
[06:29] <diverdude> dr_willis, hmm not so many. maybe 10-20 is ok
[06:29] <cub> one more q
[06:29] <dr_willis> id just cheat and use mc. and move them over ;)
[06:29] <cub> is there any way to get some scrollbars to always show, instead of me having to hoover my mouse over where the scroll thingy is
[06:29] <cub> for the actual scale t show
[06:30] <dr_willis> cub heres a setting to have the scrollbars always show.. but i cant recall its name
[06:30] <cub> ok so there is a setting
[06:30] <cub> let me check for it
[06:30] <dr_willis> the omgubuntu or webupd8 site have a lot of tweaking guides
[06:30] <cub> ty dr_willis
[06:31] <dr_willis> im so used to scrollbars now - i dont even notice them gone
[06:31] <bsmith093> dr_willis: does grep alter files, or just search through them?
[06:31] <dr_willis> grep does not alter files..
[06:31] <bsmith093> k thanks
[06:31] <dr_willis> I recall a  'gres' script/command  that could do grep and replacements in files... but havent seen that in ages
[06:31] <tekkbuzz> cub: there's alot of extra packages out there to tweak unity because some people think it's awkward.
[06:32] <dr_willis> sed/awk are normally used to alter files
[06:32] <cub> no kidding
[06:32] <cub> i cant find the screen saver setting either
[06:33] <dr_willis> cub gnome basically has gotten rid of screen savers. ;) it just blanks..
[06:33] <dr_willis> the settings tool has a serch box i belive
[06:33] <tripelb> i heard there is an ubuntu without unity called mint. if so i wpuld like it. but cam o.use rwg
[06:33] <cub> thats pretty messed up gee
[06:33] <cub> what were the developers thinking!
[06:33] <dr_willis> cub what? theres not really been much in the screensaver area for ages....
[06:34] <dr_willis> if you want fancy screensavers check out the xscreensavers package
[06:34] <cub> ok
[06:34] <cub> pretty soon they are going to remove terminal too...
[06:34] <dr_willis> gnome hasent really had any actual 'settings' tool to do more then just select a screen saver for years
[06:34] <cub> not to go off topic, and im not a fan of linux in particular but honestly, no offense to anyone, it seems they are making this more and more like windows or mac...
[06:34] <tripelb> i heard there is an ubuntu without unity called mint. if so i would like it. but can I use normal ubuntu with gnome 2 ??r
[06:35] <kunji> tripelb: that's not an Ubuntu, we talked about that just recently
[06:35] <Tex_Nick> diverdude : for bash specefic help you might try #bash
[06:35] <dr_willis> cub they are trying to make it where the common people can use it? wow. ;)
[06:35] <cub> like for basic computer users ... colorful , bright, full of graphics, but annoying for us old schoolers
[06:35] <cub> dr_willis, seems like it
[06:35] <dr_willis> the old skool stuff is still there
[06:35] <kunji> tripelb: But Lubuntu, Xubuntu, and Kubuntu are not using Unity as far as I know
[06:35] <cub> i could use kde, but kde is slow
[06:35] <dr_willis> You could use Lubuntu if you want old skool
[06:35] <cub> well guess i'll google how to enable the scroll button
[06:35] <kunji> LXDE is not slow
[06:36] <kunji> Nor is XFCE
[06:36] <karmakosmikk> how much actually is the speed difference between xubu and lubu?
[06:36] <kunji> Or you could just install your own window manager
[06:36] <karmakosmikk> i have 1 gig netbook and now running lubuntu
[06:36] <dr_willis> karmakosmikk:  i saw some benchmarks of the 4 desktops  a year+ ago.. its often more about resources used then 'speed' wiich is a little hard to measure
[06:37] <karmakosmikk> ah ok
[06:37] <dr_willis> lubuntu definatyyly used the least resources
[06:37] <kunji> karmakosmikk: I'm sure you can find some metrics if you google a bit, LXDE I think is lightest on the RAM use
[06:37] <karmakosmikk> yes it is totally light
[06:37] <tripelb> kunji i am sorry i was not here for that conversation. can you sum it.. mint not Ubuntu ...
[06:37] <dr_willis> xfce and gnome-2 were close to the same. with xfce being a little lower
[06:38] <dr_willis> ive not seen any benchmarks for 12.+ releases
[06:38] <karmakosmikk> i fell love in crunchbang but it does not seem to recognize my mobile network
[06:38] <kunji> tripelb: Mint is derived from Ubuntu in the way that Ubuntu is derived from Debian, it is different in many ways and is not done by the same people.
[06:38] <tripelb> i met ubuntu 6
[06:38] <Tex_Nick> cub : guess it's a matter of perspective ... i've been thinking for the past year that windoze is getting more like ubuntu ;-)
[06:38] <dr_willis> you can install openbox on ubuntu and havce the basics of crunchbang ;)
[06:38] <cub> is the scroll thign called "overlays"?
[06:39] <dr_willis> cub sounds right.
[06:39] <cub> okay well i changed it i think
[06:39] <karmakosmikk> does openbox install mess anyway system? can i for example install openbox in lubuntu for my netbook
[06:39] <cub> i guess i need to restart xchat to find out for sure
[06:39] <mechelle69> i have a HUGE problem...I am not a programmer and should never have bought a computer with Ubuntu preloaded
=== dankest is now known as dankest|away
[06:39] <dr_willis> karmakosmikk:  lxde/lubuntu uses openbox. :)
[06:39] <mechelle69> can someone help me with a grub> prompt
[06:39] <karmakosmikk> ahaa :D
[06:40] <karmakosmikk> ok, well crunch just have modified it
[06:40] <Tex_Nick> !ask | mechelle69
[06:40] <ubottu> mechelle69: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[06:40] <karmakosmikk> seems that unetbootin does not work well with all linux iso's?
[06:41] <tripelb> i met ubuntu 6.1 and the desktop was transparent to me. it was all good except for synaptric ?? the program asser. i never ever mase ir work.  i am.an apt-get girl. .. oh yeah and gimp. :*
[06:43] <tripelb> :* the face of an unpleasant taste.
[06:43] <mechelle69> i just got a dell vostro with ubuntu and couldn't remember my password so I tried to reset it and ended up in a screen similar to a dos screen and set system, admin, and hdd passwords then I got something about a minimal bash line editing and a grub>
[06:44] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : so, do you have a specific ubuntu related support question ?
[06:44] <mechelle69> how do i get my os back up and running?  i can't get out of this screen
[06:44] <tripelb> so if mint is not ubuntu i will find out how to go For gnome... or learn unity
[06:45] <dr_willis> mechelle69: you have data on it you want to keep?
[06:45] <mechelle69> no i just got the computer yesterday
[06:45] <dr_willis> gnome shell is installable on ubuntu
[06:46] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  if it came with some disks you could reinstall the os.
[06:46] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: i aaws ud mint was thw aame aa ubuntu and i was tild i.missed the.conversation about that. So i.am trying to find out what i missed .. and +2
[06:47] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  and check out the fixgrub wiki page
[06:47] <dr_willis> !fixgrub
[06:47] <ubottu> GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[06:47] <mechelle69> i am so lost.  i should have just stuck with windows.  i thought it would be cool to try something new...and no disks to reinstall with...also my husband burned one and still can't get passed this
[06:48] <dr_willis> you may gave burnt it wrong or its not set to boot the cd
[06:49] <mechelle69> it is GNU GRUB version 1.99-21ubuntu3.1
[06:49] <tripelb> and (2) this 11.04 diak stopped.because it was not online. and.. can i split up.the.windows partition
[06:49] <subdesign> oh yeah with 3.5.0-22 no internet (no lan, no wifi) :-/
[06:49] <dr_willis> mechelle69: dells website may have a cd image you can download also
[06:50] <mechelle69> okay...i will try there and let you know
[06:50] <bipul> Have any one used Emulation in ubuntu (Network Simulation with Emulation in ubuntu).
[06:50] <dr_willis> im not going to ask how you frogot your password in 1 day.... :-)
[06:51] <serp__> i do it all the time
[06:51] <dr_willis> cheap of dell to not unclude a cd
[06:51] <serp__> if i remember it for one day though it will stick
[06:52] <tripelb> Tex_Nick:sorry tiny phone keypad. sid you understand the 3 questions, especially about -- > can i split the windows partition and not lose windows
[06:52] <serp__> unclude? they certainly did unclude the cd!
[06:53] <tripelb> Dell will send disks
[06:54] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : what exactly are you trying to do ... linux distro ? dual boot ? etc ...
[06:55] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: yep. just got someone's old computer with Windows XP. I want to add ubuntu as a dual boot. Right.
[06:56] <bsmith093> is it possible to only grep the first 50 lines or so? the matches im looking for, will be header-like parts of text files
[06:56] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : ok, old computer ... what size is the hard drive
[06:57] <wald0> what is the name of the ubuntu live installer ?
[06:58] <dr_willis> wald0:  you mean the insggaller that installs the OS to the hard drive? or the iso to a usb?
[06:59] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : you need to make sure the hard drive has enough free space to install another os :)
[06:59] <dr_willis> bsmith093:  use head to  send only the first 50 lines to grep
[06:59] <bsmith093> dr_willis: can head be recursive and does it whine about files with spaces in the name?
[07:00] <FlowRiser> hey all, i'm having a bit of a problem on my netbook running Ubuntu12.04; If i try to get sources through sudo apt-get source foo; i get "You must put some 'source' URIs in your sources.list"
[07:00] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: right now i have 11.04 the drive is 60G and has a 40 and 20 appx partitions. i think the second is for backup.
[07:01] <wald0> dr_willis: the os to the hard drive
[07:02] <NielsMkn> hello
[07:03] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : when you say you now have 11.04 ... does that mean that the pc already has win xp & ubuntu installed ?
[07:03] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: i was thinking if ubuntu can read.write a win.type partition
[07:04] <FlowRiser> tripelb, of course it can ... it can format in fat32 or ntfs
[07:04] <wald0> what is the name of the ubuntu live installer ? (iso to hard-disk)
[07:04] <NielsMkn> I wanted to use my android tablet's wifi connection to access interent on my pc. Any idea how to do this?
[07:04] <FlowRiser> wald0, wubi installer
[07:04] <wald0> FlowRiser: this is for windows
[07:04] <wald0> i mean the one is run in live mode
[07:04] <lolmaus> I've got Ubuntu 12.04 LTS Minimal. I would like my server to be able to send emails to me (e. g. when RAID fails). I don't need any other email functionality. What is the simpliest way to configure that?
[07:05] <FlowRiser> wald0, all cds from ubuntu run in live mode
[07:05] <wald0> FlowRiser: the name of the installer
[07:05] <tripelb> no Tex_Nick i have a computer w xp 40g and backup partition 20g. appx size. -- the newest livecd i have is 11.04 but maybe thats ik
[07:05] <FlowRiser> wald0, download ubuntu 12.04 LTS iso, burn it; boot in live mode
[07:05] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : that can be done ... but we need to knowe your exact build now ... unless you just want to clean install windows & ubuntu
[07:05] <tripelb> ok
[07:06] <cub> how do i select all in terminal
[07:06] <wald0> FlowRiser: i want to know the NAME of the INSTALLER
[07:06] <tripelb> is that "my exact  b???uild" -- new term ti me
[07:06] <cub> for example "ctrl+a"
[07:07] <fuzzyking> I just installed pinguy 11.04 and am unable to download updates. When i use the update manager i get E: Encountered a section with no Package: header
[07:07] <fuzzyking> E: Problem with MergeList /var/lib/apt/lists/deb.paissad.net_dists_unstable_main_binary-amd64_Packages
[07:07] <fuzzyking> E: The package lists or status file could not be parsed or opened.
[07:07] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : do you have the pc turned on now
[07:07] <FlowRiser> wald0, it doesn't have a name, cause it's not an installer
[07:08] <tripelb> no but what do you qant to know ill be thwrw in a jif. actuallt it us on
[07:08] <tripelb> is on Tex_Nick
[07:08] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : if so how much free space do you have on the C drive
[07:09] <wald0> i can't believe that...
[07:09] <wald0> guys, is so hard to tell me the NAME of the INSTALLER of ubuntu that  is launched in LIVE MODE ???
[07:10] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: free space 40% oe 60 in the larger partition and i say all of the smaller can be freed.
[07:10]  * wald0 feels frustrated
[07:10] <FlowRiser> wald0, you are being difficult; i already told you there isn't one that i know of. Get the iso from the ubuntu website, burn it, boot into live mode.
[07:10] <wald0> LOL wtf ? are you guys joking me ?
[07:11] <wald0> nobody has never installed ubuntu in the hard disk ?
[07:11] <FlowRiser> wald0, please refrain yourself, and get your terms straight.
[07:11] <FlowRiser> wald0, live mode means running directly from a usb or cd/dvdrom
[07:12] <mechelle69> dr. willis: well, i can find no cd or download on the dell site and i looked up the !fixgrub...which, of course, makes no sense to me at all.  when i try to enter anything it says "unkown command"
[07:12] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : will you want to add more windows applications in the future ?
[07:12] <dr_willis> wald0:  ubiquity is the insaller the live ce usews to install the os
[07:13] <dr_willis> !fixgrub | mechelle69
[07:13] <ubottu> mechelle69: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows?

[07:13] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  !stuff are bot commands in the channel
[07:13] <wald0> dr_willis: ooh, finally! thank you !
[07:14] <wald0> FlowRiser: see, was not so hard !
[07:14] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  you are at the grub  shell. ive no idea how you managed to reset the system and break it that way
[07:14] <wald0> crap
[07:14] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : it's kinda a small harddrive for dual boot ... can be done though ... some considerations need to be made though
[07:14] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  you should be able to use any ubuntu cd and reinstgtall the os if all else fails
[07:14] <wald0> i can't believe that people confuses "live" with "install" and with "windows"
[07:14] <dr_willis> wald0:  theres anotehr tool that  does a live install onto a usb...
[07:14] <dr_willis> so  it was a little vague
[07:15] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: at the computer. windows part. is 35/52 free. Backup part. 18.2/18.3G free

[07:16] <jirido> icons ubuntu or lubuntu use are they gtk icons?
[07:16] <dr_willis> wald0:  if you mean the tool that installs ubuntu INSIDE windows into a  full session on the windows Hard drive.. that would be  'wubi'
[07:16] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  you are at teh GRUB shell. not the actual OS
[07:16] <tripelb> tex ok am listening. I'll  be glad to have it. or...
[07:16] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  you need to boot  a live cd and try to repair the system
[07:17] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  there is a 'boot-repair' live cd that has the tools built in. or any ubuntu cd should also let you do the repair
[07:17] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: i have a sata drive with 10.04 here but this computer is too old for sata
[07:18] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : you could install ubuntu 12.04 on the backup partition without having to mess with the windows partition
[07:19] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : what are the specs of that pc ... make & model ?
[07:20] <mechelle69> my husband had burned the disk...it won
[07:20] <mechelle69> t wont' do anything
[07:20] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  and its very likely he did it wrong.
[07:20] <mechelle69> still at the same screan
[07:20] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  look on the disk.. what files are on it
[07:20] <dr_willis> if you see a single whatever.iso file.. he did it wrong
[07:20] <mechelle69> i have to move it to this computer to do that...brb
[07:21] <Tex_Nick> we would want to make it's not a dinosaur ;-)

[07:22] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: will 11.04 work too? with no internet connection? ditto for 12.04
[07:22] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : an internet connection would be the BEST option ... because when you install ... it would download necessary drivers
[07:23] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : can you connect it to the intwernet
[07:23] <Tex_Nick> \internet*
[07:24] <mechelle69> files are .disk, casper, install,preseed, boot, dists, isolinux, pool, and some documents: md5sum, autorun, readmediskdefines, and wubi
[07:24] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  any idea what tool he used to burn it?
[07:24] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  and do you have a flash drive of 1gb+ in size?
[07:24] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: i do not have one. for the moment my phone is my hotspot- at like dialip.speed
[07:25] <mechelle69> he used infrarecorder
[07:25] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  thats goodll so most likely the issue is you need to tell the pc to boot the  cd then from the bios menus
[07:26] <mechelle69> how do i do that
[07:26] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : if you only have a 11.04 disk ... i would recommend you just boot into it to see if it looks like it will work ok
[07:26] <dr_willis> watch it boot up. try the esc, f1, f2, del, backspace keys (it may say what to use) to get to the bios to make the cdrom the first boot device
[07:26] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: no internet here. no car to transport. No. Not even a wireless card in this 2002 computer
[07:27] <tripelb> Tex
[07:27] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: ok o will. be

[07:31] <dr_willis> wald0:   think of all the varity of comptuers.. and if it  dosent allow for every quirk  of every pc.. it could be considered a bug.
[07:31] <mechelle69> there is about half a second where it says F2 Setup and F12 Boot options...but it will not respond to either...it goes directly t a service tag: 4G5WHW1 and asks for the system password

[07:37] <mechelle69> all i want to do is scream and throw the laptop...i will have to call dell tomorrow and have them take this thing back, which means another 2 weeks without a laptop...all because I wanted to try something other than Windows
[07:37] <mechelle69> i give up, thanks for trying to help, dr. willis
[07:38] <dr_willis> system password? You set a system password?
[07:38] <mechelle69> yes
[07:38] <dr_willis> mechelle69:    so you should hit F12 then enter the password..
[07:39] <dr_willis> then tell it to boot the cd
[07:39] <jirido> mechelle69, Cool off.. it will be alright..
[07:39] <dr_willis> no idea why you set a system password. ;)
[07:40] <mechelle69> F12 does nothing...it will let me enter the password and then asks for the hdd password which i enter and then i get a flash of someting that says error prefix and then i get the GNU GRUB version with minimal bash-like line editing message and the grub> prompt
[07:41] <mechelle69> set both passwords when i was trying to reset my admin password ;0(
[07:41] <dr_willis> sounds like you may be entering a password wrong..  I never set those passwords
[07:41] <dr_willis> there may be some way to reset the bios to remove the passwords
[07:42] <mechelle69> it won't let me enter an incorrect password and move on.
[07:43] <mechelle69> ok, i got to the setup utility
[07:43] <mechelle69> what do i do from here
[07:45] <megha> can i use dwm and awesome with ubuntu ?
[07:45] <dr_willis> set it to boot from the cd first

[07:49] <Blkrdo> Cant shutdown ubuntu what to do?
[07:50] <dr_willis> press and hold the power button. ;)
[07:50] <Blkrdo> Ha,ha! Other than that?
[07:50] <dr_willis> you meanyou tell it to shutdown.. it shuts down but fails to power off? or what exactly
[07:51] <Blkrdo> No it just hangs at the splash
[07:51] <fidel> Blkrdo: and how are you actually trying to 'shutdown' it?

[07:51] <Blkrdo> Using the gui
[07:52] <mechelle69> i can't delete the passwords ... this is Aptio Setup Utility - American Mega Trends, Inc.  I have main, advanced, security, boot  and exit tabs but at the bottom there are directions for movment and how to select an item...also says F9 to lad defults...should I do that cuz i am afraid to touch anything at this point
[07:52] <fidel> Blkrdo: i would try to jump to a tty and shutdown it using the 'halt' or 'shutdown' command at that point
[07:52] <dr_willis> log out to the Lightdm login screen and try the shutdown  option from there.
[07:52] <somsip> megha: it does exist, but the bot is complaining about it: http://packages.ubuntu.com/quantal/awesome
[07:52] <dr_willis> f9 should reset the passwords i would imagine
[07:52] <dr_willis>  or under security may be a way to reset them
[07:52] <dr_willis> but as long as you rember them and can get in.. it dosent matter

[07:53] <dr_willis> use the boot item to set it to boot from cd first

[07:54] <fidel> Blkrdo: i ment for the current situation.
[07:54] <dr_willis> an app not closeing - wont keep it from powering down..
[07:54] <cub> how do i change the mouse cursor color on ubuntu 12.04
[07:54] <dr_willis> the system will kill it off anyway
[07:54] <kunji> dr_willis: She set the system password, in the bios?
=== gary_ is now known as Guest86694
[07:54] <fidel> Blkrdo: and then i was asking how you try to shutdown it - using the ui doesnt really answer it - as you could use a ton of different ui's
[07:54] <dr_willis> its possible its saying 'its now safe to power off the pc' under the splash screen that you cant see
[07:55] <dr_willis> kunji:  aparently
[07:55] <mechelle69> i can set them to something new but they have to be replace...boot screen choices: file browser add boot option, file browser del boot option secure bood (disabled), load legacy option rom (endabled) boot option #1 UEFI OS, boot option #2 UEFI: IP4 realteck PCI GBE Family Controller and the last option is IP6
[07:56] <kunji> dr_willis: Those are usually to prevent tampering, so resetting via the bios isn't going to work, she'll have to open it up and clear the CMOS, not sure if laptops always provide the pins for that, so it might be necessary to remove the little watch style battery to do so.
[07:56] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  somehow you set it to boot from the cdrom. #1
[07:56] <Blkrdo> Fidel: the standard one in ubuntu from the top panel
[07:56] <fidel> Blkrdo: so using unity i assume?
[07:56] <Blkrdo> Fidel: ya
[07:57] <Blkrdo> Fidel: do you think syslog will help
[07:57] <dr_willis> kunji:  aparently she set it from some utilty dell put on the thing..   but its not clear on what all has been done to it
[07:57] <kunji> dr_willis: Ah, if she was able to change that, then it's not the bios password that was set, but I think booting from cdrom as first priority is normally the default.
[07:58] <kunji> dr_willis: Hmm, should still happen after the bios though, so can't she get to a liveCD environment then?
[07:58] <mechelle69> ok i had the set up locked so that is now unlocked i don't know what option is the cd rom...itcan i add that as an option
[07:59] <dr_willis> mechelle69:  using the bios menus or that F12 key you should be able to set the cd to be the first bootable device.
[08:00] <dr_willis> there may be some pull down menus, or places to click to change the boot order
[08:00] <dr_willis> you will most likely want to order to be #1 cdrom #2 uefi OS
[08:02] <mechelle69> here are my choices to set order...cd/dvd drive, network, hard drive, usb storage device, diskette drive...and that is not the current order
[08:02] <FRO5T> network lol
[08:02] <mechelle69> and should secure boot be disabled
[08:02] <dr_willis> you need to set the cd/dvd to be fiirst..   then that hard drive
[08:02] <dr_willis> keep secure boot disabled
[08:02] <kunji> Go for cd/dvd drive, hard drive, anything else for now
[08:03] <Blkrdo> What to look for if standard unity gui cant shutdown your laptop! Its kind of hanging with the splash visible,behind it the last line is some thin about postgresql,and its stuck there!
[08:03] <dr_willis> cd, usb, hard drive, would be good also
[08:03] <Tex_Nick> kunji : wandered off for a bit ... just looked at screen ... something about resetting bios on laptop ... hey most users will njever get a laptop apart and back together again ... for removing the button battery that is

[08:28] <dr_willis> the gnome fallback was schedules for removeale.. but im not sure if its still on schedule for that

[08:35] <kunji> qwerkus: Can you get to a terminal via ctrl+alt+f1?  Or is the freeze still before GRUB passes over control?  Any luck booting from a liveCD or liveUSB?
[08:36] <qwerkus> kunji>: no, tty terms do not work. Grub seems to work fine; the freezing must happen afterwards.  LiveCD works fine: i can access to my files
[08:37] <qwerkus> as a matter of fact, I'm chrooted into the broken system via livecd right now
[08:37] <tekkbuzz> rigo: the 5901 port is the first virtual desktop and 5902 would be the second, 5900 would be the default one.
[08:37] <qwerkus> any thought about how to diagnose the problem ?
[08:40] <kunji> qwerkus: Hmm, well you've gotten as far as my knowledge would take you.  I guess check your logs, they might have info on what point in the boot the failure occured.  Other than that I don't know, but that might give some direction if there's something there.  Unfortunately though I need to sleep (3:40 A.M. here).
[08:40] <dr_willis> Tex_Nick:  i recall some postings/blogs about hwo the next gnome was to remive the  thing.. but i seem to recall reading it got a stay of executaion so to epeak

[08:43] <kunji> dr_willis: oh, nvm then, it's probably not a short one, hopefully someone here can help though
[08:43] <dr_willis> if the failsafe/fallback/recovery console freezes... that is bad
[08:43] <kunji> qwerkus: Well, if no one else is available, I'll probably be back on tomorrow
[08:43] <dr_willis> might try an older kenrel from the grub menus to see if that works
[08:44] <dr_willis> i cant think of anything else that wold do the freezing.. unless theres some hw issue. or filesystem issue.
[08:47] <geordee> Is it better to install 32-bit or 64-bit on and Core i3?
[08:48] <qwerkus> anyone else to figure how why my desktop freezes just after grub loads the kernel ?
[08:49] <benkaiser> Hey guys, I am on 12.04 and I have to click on the desktop for any keyboard shortcuts to work after closing an application. Anyone know what could be causing this?

[08:51] <qwerkus> <geordee> from what I know, you're always better off picking the software arch that matches your cpu. In your case: 64bits

[08:54] <redwind> can anyone here help with vsftpd
[08:54] <sop> which filesystem should i choose while installing ubuntu ext3,4?
[08:55] <Tex_Nick> !ask | redwind
[08:55] <ubottu> redwind: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[08:57] <qwerkus> <sop>: depends on what you need
[08:57] <qwerkus> fast: btrfs
[08:57] <qwerkus> stable: ext3
[08:57] <qwerkus> compromise: ext4
[08:57] <sop> qwerkus: i am installing lubuntu ext4 will work or not?
[08:58] <qwerkus> <sop> of course it will
[08:58] <dr_willis> ext4 is the default fs normally
[08:58] <sop> ok thanx
[08:58] <redwind> I have setup vsftp and I can login fine but when I go to transfer files it gives me "counld not start transfer"
[08:59] <Tex_Nick> redwind : hey ask your question ... someone here can probably helo or at least point you in a good direction :)
[09:00] <redwind> TeX_Nick : I already did
[09:00] <redwind> I have setup vsftp and I can login fine but when I go to transfer files it gives me "counld not start transfer"
[09:02] <redwind> I had to chmod the specific directory
[09:02] <Tex_Nick> redwind : sorry guee i need a cup of coffee ;-)
[09:02] <Tex_Nick> guess*
[09:02] <redwind> ifs there a way to avoid having to chmod specific directories everytime
[09:04] <dr_willis> redwind:  what directory? what user are you using?
[09:05] <redwind> I m usign y defualt user to upload themes and manipulate the code for wordpress
[09:05] <bug2000> Hello. If I got a bunch of jpg's how do I create 1 pdf from them?
[09:07] <dr_willis> redwind:   uploading where exactly?
[09:08] <redwind> as of right now but I would like to venture ofther places in the future
[09:09] <redwind> "/var/www/wordpress/wp-content"
[09:09] <Tex_Nick> bug2000 : if a cloud resource is ok for you, try ... http://convertjpgpdf.net/
[09:10] <bug2000> Tex_Nick, Thank you but it's not.
[09:10] <bug2000> Also I just found it convert *.jpg file.pdf -- imagemagick.
[09:10] <dr_willis> redwind:  i belive you want to use  the groups feature of linux/ubuntu to allow the user access to system directories like that.. not just chown/chmoding the dirs
[09:12] <qwerkus> ok: which log records what happen during the last boot ?
[09:12] <redwind> dr_willis : thank you I will takw a look into that
=== newbie is now known as Guest98894
[09:19] <Guest98894> I add openDNS servers into /etc/resolv.conf, but after restart they disapeared? How to make these settings persistent? Maybe tor browser overwrite them ?
[09:22] <Xetius> Guest98894, I guess that resolv.conf is a file?  It's a link on my system to /run.resolvconf/resolv.conf
[09:22] <iceroot> do we have any working activesync clients in ubuntu for reading/sending mails on exchange 2010 which has only OWA+activesync enabled? evolution, kontact and thunderbird are not supporting activesync as it seems

[09:25] <dr_willis> I think tunapie uses streamripper for its ripping features... but ive used it befor for stations
[09:28] <rigo> is the msata interface just like the slim dvd interface?
[09:28] <dr_willis> msata is like a ssd on a memory chip sized package i thought.. no idea what a slimdvd interface is..
[09:31] <alimj> dr_willis: You are right. rigo: More info: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/msata-ssd-flash,2948.html
[09:32] <dr_willis> alimj:  intel has some little desktop box comming out thsat uses them.
[09:32] <rigo> gr8 only because the msata->sata converter costs 20euro and a slimdvdcable about 1.20 euro :D
[09:32] <atlef> i have one on my mainboard
[09:32] <alimj> dr_willis: I heard about them. Introduced in CES
[09:33] <dr_willis> still no idea what a slimdvd is.. unless its some ultrabook spec
[09:34] <alimj> dr_willis: Slim DVDs are for notebooks
[09:34] <rigo> http://www.laptopparts101.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/sata-vs-slimline-atapi-connecotr.jpg here
[09:34] <rigo> im looking for the cheapest and fastest quiet storage.
[09:34] <dr_willis> so i dont see how a slimddvd cablee would work for a msata  thing. ;)
[09:34] <alimj> rigo: Look into Tomshardware best SSD for money articles
[09:34] <rigo> system is about max. 10 gib inclusive swap. of corse i can put the swap on my hdd too. so an 8gib would be more than enough.
[09:35] <rigo> checkin'
[09:35] <TheGrey> o/ I have a blank disk and a RAID 1 setup with: md0 (swap), md1 (/) and md2 (home). I want to know how to A) Format my disk to accept data (i.e. setup probably the whole disk as ext4) B) rsync the files for the purposes of a backup. Much love and thanks..Grey

[09:36] <rigo> do u have any suggestions other than msata 16gib mini-drive?
[09:36] <qwerkus> IT WORKS! Yuhuuu. In cased anyone wonders: it was a graphic problem. Fglrx never again. Solve by purging the driver and reinstalling the xorg.server. Strange part is that I had to run a grub-update via livecd to get it to work again ?!
[09:36] <benkaiser> I am on 12.04 and I have to click on the desktop for any keyboard shortcuts (e.g. switching workspaces) to work after closing an application. Anyone know what could be causing this?
[09:37] <dr_willis> benkaiser:  try  makign a new user - see if it afffects them also
[09:37] <rigo> i wouldnt like to spend more than 20euro on it.
[09:37] <alimj> rigo: In that case, you may use some small industrial SATA devices for IPCs
[09:38] <rigo> qwerkus: i installed this way and it'ts almost just fine: http://youresuchageek.blogspot.fr/2012/06/xbmc-install-and-config-howto-for-linux.html
[09:40] <rigo> i have my sys right now on my hdd but its "damn" noisy... i wouldnt like to hear that awful hdd-load-sound.. :D
[09:41] <rigo> i have an usb3.0 interface, but dont have any usb3.0device.
[09:42] <Tex_Nick> rigo : don't know what transfer rate you need ... but as far as cheap ... i've bought 4 32 GB microSMB cards with usb adapters in the past year for about $18 US ... i love them
[09:43] <rigo> u mean microSD?
[09:43] <rigo> usb2.0 is a bit slow for a whole ubuntu system i think.
[09:43] <Tex_Nick> rigo : typo ... yeah :)
[09:44] <rigo> :)
=== Kneferilis_ is now known as Kneferilis
[09:45] <rigo> so pci-e or sata interface..
[09:45] <iceroot> rigo: usb2.0 is able to transfer 60MByte/s which is fine for ubuntu. i am running different systems on a usb2.0 port (raspbian with xbmc, ubuntu with lxde desktop) its ok
[09:45] <alimj> Rigo: I once worked with such a device for one IPC: http://ec.transcendusa.com/product/product_memory.asp?Cid=136 ; however, they are useful for Industrial PCs as the cost /MB is too high
[09:45] <rigo> im not sure that this would be enough Verbatim USB 8 GB Store 'n' Go V3 USB 3.0
[09:46] <rigo> thanks for the link! yep its a bit expensive.
[09:46] <Tex_Nick> rigo : i'm using one of them as a portable ubuntu boot ... to repair windoze box's ... it runs fast enough ... only thing i worry about is loosing it, it's so small :-)
[09:46] <rigo> hehe
[09:46] <rigo> right
[09:46] <Borgso> Going to put up a new home-fileserver, been doing it oldschool (ext3 or MD-raid) before but i see alot talk about ZFS. Is this something recomended as alternative to md-softraid?
[09:46] <alimj> Rigo: USBs are cheaper. Yet they have less MTBF. They are also to slooow
[09:47] <rigo> the 8 gib usb3.0 looks the best solution now....
[09:47] <rigo> BUT if i get a 32gib msata drive for 20 it would be enough for me. but im not sure about that custom interface....
[09:48] <Tex_Nick> rigo : can't give you a good UK resource to purchace ... but in US www.newegg.com has great selection and price ... shipping might be BAD for you though :(
[09:48] <rigo> i only need the string what i have to search for :) i always find the cheapest way ;)
[09:49] <cub> how do i change the cursor color in ubuntu 12.04
[09:49] <rigo> however the msata converter is 16euro and the drive is 20 so its 36 together. for this price i can get a standard 64gib ssd vertex3..
[09:49] <cub> i cant find anything in the settings
[09:50] <dr_willis> cub you mean the mouse pointer?
[09:50] <cub> yeah
[09:50] <cub> pointer
[09:51] <dr_willis> ive seen it done with some cursor themes.. but the process seems flakey
[09:51] <Tex_Nick> rigo : isn't that a kick in the rear ... drives me crazy ... stuff like that :)
[09:51] <dr_willis> you may want to check askubuntu.com see if they got  good guide
[09:51] <cub> i didnt have trouble doing it with 10.04 :\
[09:51] <dr_willis> 10.04 was using gnome2
[09:51] <dr_willis> i belive
[09:53] <rigo> i spent already too much on that shit...
[09:53] <rigo> my gf makes me crazy. "oh no u ordered some shit again for that THING?" :D
[09:53] <rigo> YES baby that THING is our life every fckn day 19:00 - 23:00 :D
[09:54] <dr_willis> tell her  'sudo go make me some fried eggs and ham!'
[09:54] <CrestedNewt> rigo, in the UK have a look at http://www.lambda-tek.com/
[09:54] <rigo> sudo lol
[09:54] <cub> doesnt sound like the new gnome is very customizable
[09:54] <Tex_Nick> lol
[09:55] <szx> what can I do about X freezes? happens like every day, I have to switch to TTY and do pkill X to make things work again
[09:56] <tripelb> Tex_Nick: I installed 11.04 -- I do not have the hardware for unity. I should go "somewhere?"  and choose 'classic'. But where? -- S it boots me to something that looks like gnome but it is flakey. Not writing the screen correctly. Menus flicker don't stay. What next?
[09:56] <dr_willis> cub it wasent ment to be
[09:56] <cub> what wasnt
[09:56] <rigo> thanks checkin checkin' but like i saied i dont need a store, i need a product what is the cheapest way.
[09:56] <dr_willis> cub but do you mean gnome-shell or unity. ;) since both run on top of the gnome ccore
[09:57] <cub> well i found something
[09:57] <cub> said to use update-alternatives
[09:57] <rigo> szx u should check the log if why is it crahses.
[09:57] <cub> i selected DMZ black for the cursor theme
[09:57] <cub> will find out on reboot if it worked
[09:57] <szx> rigo: which log
[09:57] <szx> ?
[09:57] <rigo> X log
[09:57] <szx> it doesn't seem to crash
[09:58] <rigo> some log should show something.
[09:58] <rigo> i suggest u to delete all logfiles, and if it chrashes, check them one-by-one to find out the reason of the chrash.
[09:59] <cub> wow unity is so annoying :\
[09:59] <cub> i hope i get used to it ..

[10:14] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : now would be a good time to explain your needs ... just the basics ... you wnat to install ununtu on an old pc that has win xp on one partiton and another 36 GB partition that you want to install ubuntu on ...
[10:14] <pentarex> FRO5T: is this for me?
[10:15] <FRO5T> yes
[10:15] <girishb> Guys have a serious problem here please help me
[10:15] <MonkeyDust> girishb  start with a serious question

[10:16] <pentarex> crontab*
[10:16] <MonkeyDust> girishb  what ubuntu version and what package?
[10:16] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : you've tried ubuntu 11.04 ... no luck ... where should i go from here ... someone can help you
[10:17] <girishb> LTS 10.04
[10:17] <girishb> for any package
[10:17] <girishb> say wget
[10:18] <MonkeyDust> girishb  try sudo apt-get update, first, then sudo apt-get -f install
[10:18] <girishb> tried that
[10:18] <girishb> also used sudo dpkg --configure -a

[10:18] <FRO5T> dpkg -i
[10:19] <Narel> hi
[10:19] <Narel> I want to identify what is /usr/share/webm
[10:19] <Tex_Nick> tripelb : you still there ?
[10:19] <Narel> I can't find information about this process
[10:19] <auronandace> Narel: webm is a codec
[10:20] <girishb> MonkeyDust no errors while running dpkg --configure -a or apt-get -f install
[10:20] <Narel> that's impossible, that's a temporary zombie process in Ubuntu server
[10:20] <Narel> and there is no multimedia parts in the server
[10:20] <MonkeyDust> girishb  and while installing -- also sure there are no corrupt or old sources?
[10:20] <pentarex> FRO5T: any other ideas mate?
[10:20] <MonkeyDust> girishb  or a ppa, even?
[10:20] <auronandace> Tex_Nick: if he's using 11.04 tell him its no longer supported
[10:21] <Narel> oups is there a dependency whithin webm and prosody server ?
[10:21] <girishb> MonkeyDust tried  clean and autoclean
[10:21] <auronandace> Narel: do the following: file /usr/share/webm
[10:21] <MonkeyDust> girishb  type sudo apt-get update | pastebinit and paste the url here
[10:21] <FRO5T> pentarex: I've installed webmin and just set up the cronjobs for which scripts to load during the startup process
[10:21] <girishb> MonkeyDust is there any way to rebuild the deb database or index ?
[10:21] <Narel> why this process is zombie and then disappear and reapear
[10:22] <auronandace> !webmin | FRO5T
[10:22] <ubottu> FRO5T: webmin is no longer supported in Debian and Ubuntu. It is not compatible with the way that Ubuntu packages handle configuration files, and is likely to cause unexpected issues with your system.

[10:22] <dr_willis> :)
[10:22] <FRO5T> I will make an snapshot of webmin, just wait while
[10:23] <dr_willis> webmin isent really reccomended to be used.
[10:23] <dr_willis> better to  use that zentyl (if i spell it right)

[10:26] <pentarex> I dont have GUI on this machine it is only terminal
[10:26] <FRO5T> just download the wanted server, install it and call your localhost ip in the browser and be happy after setting up the cron jobs from webmin ;)
[10:26] <pentarex> ahaaa

[10:27] <girishb> MonkeyDust sorry I do not know what is PPA
[10:27] <pentarex> no I dont want to do this... it is a Production server as I said. :(
[10:27] <auronandace> FRO5T: please don't suggest webmin here
[10:27] <FRO5T> why?
[10:27] <MonkeyDust> girishb  and what package won't install?
[10:27] <auronandace> FRO5T: it isn't supported
[10:27] <FRO5T> it's integrated in the distribution of turnkey
[10:28] <auronandace> FRO5T: this is #ubuntu, we don't support different distros here
[10:28] <Tex_Nick> auronandace : would seem not though ... tripelb seems to only have a 11.04 live cd and no internet connection except phone
[10:28] <FRO5T> my bad, sorry
[10:28] <pentarex> auronandace: mate can you tell me how I can find executable .sh file if I dont know the location?

[10:43] <HugoSthlm> I have a problem attaching to WiFi networks. The connection is established. When I open a browser I am supposed to get a redirect to https://1.1.1.1 then a login, but the browser hangs.
[10:43] <B0073D> I don't want to kill the process as it's kernel related...
[10:44] <HugoSthlm> The redirect problem suddenly appeared and I have no clue to what I have changed that caused this.

[11:04] <beefcafe> hi. dns resolution doesn't work anymore after upgrading to 12.10
[11:04] <blazemore> beefcafe: what happens when you type dig +trace google.com
[11:04] <ThinkT510> !resolvconf | beefcafe
[11:04] <ubottu> beefcafe: resolvconf is a set of scripts that's used to manage /etc/resolv.conf in 12.04 and later, for more information please see: http://www.stgraber.org/2012/02/24/dns-in-ubuntu-12-04/ and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.10/serverguide/network-configuration.html#name-resolution

[11:07] <ThinkT510> TheGrey: were you looking to backup?

[11:08] <johnshaft> anybody help troubleshoot bluetooth audio playback from cell phone to 12.04 LTS - input levels and phone are showing playback but no sound from headphones/speakers ???
[11:08] <beefcafe> it's a symlink to resolvconf, and there's only comments in it
[11:09] <TheGrey> ThinkT510: yeah, I'm thinking of using a rsync alt (rdiff-backup)..I was recommended to do /etc/, /home/ and "installed packages"...I assume thats at /usr/?
[11:09] <ThinkT510> !clone | TheGrey
[11:09] <ubottu> TheGrey: To replicate your packages selection on another machine (or restore it if re-installing), you can type « aptitude  --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/my-packages », move the file "my-packages" to the other machine, and there type « sudo xargs aptitude --schedule-only install < my-packages ; sudo aptitude install » (this may cause problems with multiarch before 12.10) - See also !automate

[11:13] <omghax> Can't you install it via binary file?
[11:13] <ThinkT510> !java | cloudgeek
[11:13] <ubottu> cloudgeek: To just use java you need a "Java Runtime Environment" (JRE) and/or a browser plugin. If that is not sufficient you will need a "Java Development Kit" (JDK) aka "Software  Development Kit" (SDK).  Please see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Java about how to install one of three current implementations.

[11:49] <ThinkT510> dcgen: installing will always require sudo
[11:50] <nabblet> ThinkT510: since not working wlan ist always the first symptom i suspect it to be the culprit - maybe wpasupplicant starts to mess with something in the kernel and the kernel can't handle that

[12:23] <MonkeyDust> castor__  don't hit enter too often, it's getting a headachr
[12:23] <castor__> but when I connect it from XP it just won't success
[12:24] <cloudgeek> I have a 32 bit processor , i686 so suggest which version of java in install x86 or x64
[12:25] <castor__> hi cloud you should read the server guide
[12:25] <cfhowlett> cloudgeek, sounds like x86 from here
[12:26] <castor__> Agree
[12:26] <cloudgeek> k
[12:26] <cloudgeek> cfhowlett: :)
[12:26] <castor__> who can deal with my problem?
[12:26] <g16> I though i686 is 64 bit.
[12:26] <g16> thought
[12:27] <morfeo_81> where i can found the distro  of linux  and new package of ubuntu?
[12:27] <castor__> nah
[12:27] <MonkeyDust> morfeo_81  ubuntu.com/downloads
[12:27] <castor__> sorry ,the nah was for g16
[12:30] <castor__> I could not connect from XP to my samba server (when I ping it, the connection and server is good they are in the same workgroup) but I can't see my server from the NetNeighbor which says I do not have the right to do so. Is there any one can help
[12:30] <Wiz_KeeD> Can someone please tell me why in my ubuntu 12.04 i can only see the root files on my s3 android device when browsing it via usb? I have a hunch it's connected as a media device and it's looking for music files, though in windows i can browse as both, also it says when browsing from ubuntu as suggestion on top "open with Rythmbox music player" + it says "You have insterted a digital audio player..." Anyone has any input on this?

[12:31] <castor__> HI Wiz
[12:32] <Wiz_KeeD> Hello castor__
[12:32] <castor__> hi
[12:32] <castor__> Have you checked your android settings?
[12:33] <microcode> g16: i686 is one of the extensions of the 80186 architecture family, two generations after i486 which was used in the 80486, i686 belonged to to the P6 family. What is usually referred to as "64-bit" is actually one such further extension to th ex86 platform, commonly denoted x86-64, i686 has 32-bit integer sizes, i286 had 16-bit ones, and x86-64 has 64-bit ones
[12:34] <llutz> *commonly denoted amd64
[12:34] <Wiz_KeeD> castor__, yes i do not have other usb settings as i did on my rooter sgs1
[12:34] <Wiz_KeeD> just media file crap and there's nothing i can do about it
[12:34] <Wiz_KeeD> read all the tutorials and forums and whatnot
[12:34] <microcode> well
[12:34] <castor__> is your sys is 4?
[12:34] <microcode> llutz: as much as I call the IA-32 family x86-32
[12:34] <cfhowlett> Wiz_KeeD, see what android forums have to say on this as well...
[12:35] <microcode> and the 80186-80286 platform x86-16

[12:56] <cfhowlett> narutolinux, well it's actually 2100 here in Beijing, so ... Greetings.
[12:56] <narutolinux> cfhowlett, oh well good evening
[12:56] <narutolinux> how is beijing, must be very nice
[12:56] <narutolinux> i'd like to visit
[12:57] <cfhowlett> narutolinux, it has its moments.  Whats on your ubuntu mind this day?
=== t0bis` is now known as t0bis
[12:57] <hays> anyone run linux on a laptop?  how is the power management? e.g. detecting lidclosingand sleeping and hibernating?
=== linuxthefish is now known as linuxthefish`
[12:59] <narutolinux> oh i see
[12:59] <ThinkT510> hays: power management can be affected by what graphics drivers you use
[12:59] <Brittany> hays: It's strongly dependent on the model, but the laptop I use is really quite good with power management. I use a little tool called powertop which is a terminal based program that turns off some unnecessary features.
[12:59] <narutolinux> cfhowlett, ubuntu mind?
[12:59] <cfhowlett> narutolinux, ubuntu support request?
[12:59] <hays> Brittany: How much of it can be automated?
[12:59] <narutolinux> oh, nothing lol
[12:59] <Brittany> What do you mean by automated?
[12:59] <narutolinux> cfhowlett, nothing to think of now
[13:00] <Brittany> and can what be automated? heh.
[13:00] <narutolinux> ubuntu chat, brb gonna eat while i think of a question to ask. lol
[13:00] <hays> Brittany: automated like how it is done in windows/mac where you have different settings for when you are plugged in or on battery, or you sleep/hibernate with the lid closed/opened, or doing various things like screen dimming after inactivity
[13:01] <TheGrey_>  o/ whilst i've rsynced my home folder... I wonder...if I use dd for the whole hard drive, will I need to manually create identilcal partion tables: e.g. via dd if=/dev/sda of=/dev/sdc bs=4096 conv=notrunc,noerror
[13:01] <Brittany> Well it's all up to you in power management features that come standard with most distros like Ubuntu.
[13:01] <Brittany> You can automate what happens on lid close..
[13:02] <Brittany> You can choose when the screen dims, brightness etc..
[13:02] <histo> Brittany: do you get asked to allow permissions in flash for video and audio?
[13:02] <TheGrey_> o/
[13:02] <Brittany> If you're referring to microphone and webcam? yeah.
=== Guest61335 is now known as MikeUTM
[13:02] <histo> Brittany: What version of flash are you using?
[13:02] <hays> Brittany: is there a package for this
[13:03] <Brittany> Flash Player 11.5
[13:03] <Brittany> package for what?
[13:03] <hays> Brittany: is it something the DE devs usually do e.g. KDE/Gnome or independently developed
[13:03] <histo> Brittany: Are you using chrome or chromium?
[13:03] <Brittany> Chrome
[13:03] <hays> Brittany: a package to install the utility to configure and enable power management
[13:03] <histo> Brittany: that's odd mine works with out a problem.
[13:03] <Brittany> depends on the type of power management.
[13:03] <Brittany> Basic power management comes standard in system settings of Ubuntu.
[13:04] <histo> Brittany: it's usually pretty trivial task but when flash is involved who knows.
[13:04] <Brittany> But if you're looking to do some 'fine tuning' you would look for alternate software packages.
[13:04] <ThinkT510> hays: yes, its usually dependent on desktop environment
[13:04] <hays> Brittany: does it come standard if I run something like XFCE?
[13:04] <Brittany> I don't have a problem, histo, not sure why you thought I did, heh.
[13:04] <histo> Brittany: have you tried searching askubuntu for your cam
[13:04] <hays> ok, so i'd have to stick with Gnome/KDE probably then
[13:04] <hays> thanks
[13:04] <Benkinooby2> *sigh*
[13:04] <histo> Brittany: you asked about getting your cam working in ubuntu with flash
[13:04] <ThinkT510> hays: yes, xfce has power management settings
[13:05] <Brittany> oh jeez, okay thatwas a while ago hah.
[13:05] <Brittany> I could do, histo
[13:05] <Brittany> let me check
[13:05] <Benkinooby2> ThinkT510, i am backing up my data and resintall
[13:05] <Benkinooby2> ThinkT510, also i will use 12.10 instead of 12.04 which i am running now
[13:05] <ThinkT510> Benkinooby2: ok
[13:05] <histo> Brittany: also when you say you got it working... What do you mean by that?  Does it work in other programs like cheese ?

[15:08] <seel> yeah, that didn't work
[15:08] <Guest67299> what is the diffrence between linux-image-3.0.0-12 generic and  linux-image-3.0.0-27 generic
[15:08] <k1l> Guest67299: the last one is newer with more patches
[15:09] <MonkeyDust> seel  from which website?
[15:09] <seel> MonkeyDust: so type !find nixnote ?
[15:09] <seel> sourceforge.net
[15:09] <Guest67299> kll: so why does'nt system update install the new one why the old one.....any theory..?
[15:09] <k1l> seel: see the answer from the bot. that program is not included in the official ubuntu repos
[15:09] <zoktar> i need to reinstall(and purge) all apport related packages and dependancys. can that be done via aptitude --purge reinstall , in some way?.
[15:10] <jrib> zoktar: why do you need to do this?
[15:10] <apg> Can somebody tell me where is the location of the script than mounting or unmounting our filesystem in start up or rebooting our ubuntu system?
[15:10] <seel> ok, so I'll have to add the app then, right?
[15:10] <k1l> Guest67299: the "apt-get upgrade" doesnt install new kernels. you need "apt-get dist-upgrade" for it
[15:10] <seel> sorry, meant add the ppa, it's called, right?
[15:11] <MonkeyDust> seel  guess you better contact this gentleman https://launchpad.net/~vincent-c/+archive/nevernote
[15:11] <Guest67299> kll: so will it be safe if i directly install it using synaptic without ap-get dist-upgrade
[15:11] <zoktar> jrib, reinstall command gets around dependancy "issues" when you just want to reinstall something with fresh cfg files.
[15:12] <jrib> zoktar: so you just want to reset the config files to their defaults?
[15:14] <zoktar> jrib, well i want a package and all its dependancys equal to a fresh install, so yeah that and anything else.
[15:14] <craigbass1976> I'm still stuck with a samba problem after a few weeks.  A line in /etc/fstab goes //192.168.2.107/moulton-files   /home/craig/share  cifs	file_mode=0777,dir_mode=0777,uid=1000,gid=1000   0 0, but I think samba isn't started yet when this tries to mount.  After a few minutes (once I've logged in) of what appears to be normal, I get a black screen with text.  I dpn't remember what it says now, but it's because this mount fails.
[15:15] <jrib> !cifs | craigbass1976

[15:15] <ubottu> craigbass1976: Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
[15:15] <subdesign> whats the difference when after a packaga name there is :i386 in Software center?
[15:15] <bkc_> subdesign: 32bit
[15:15] <ThinkT510> subdesign: i386 means its the 32bit version
[15:15] <jrib> craigbass1976: there's a mount option you can add that indicates it needs the network.  If the wiki pages don't mention it check the man page for mount or fstab  for something like "netdev"
[15:15] <MonkeyDust> subdesign  i386 is 32bit
[15:16] <nabblet> but isn't eg 1686 32 bit too?
[15:16] <subdesign> ok sorry mixed up thinkgs of course
[15:16] <nabblet> *i686
[15:16] <ThinkT510> nabblet: yes
[15:16] <Pici> craigbass1976: You probably need to use the _netdev option
[15:16] <nabblet> why then i386?
[15:16] <jrib> zoktar: ok.  I don't know how to do that for a package and *all of its dependencies* in a nice way.  Can I ask again, why you want to do this?
[15:16] <MonkeyDust> 686 is from the 386-family

[15:18] <NielsMkn> hello everyone
[15:18] <nabblet> MonkeyDust, ok - thank you
[15:18] <NielsMkn> what are the necessary partitions for installing ubuntu properly?
[15:18] <NielsMkn> or lets say recommended instead
[15:18] <MonkeyDust> NielsMkn  / and swap but better would be / swap and /home
[15:19] <BluesKaj> NielsMkn,  / , /home and swap
[15:19] <ThinkT510> NielsMkn: only necessary is root (/), recommended is / and swap and /home
[15:19] <KylieBrooks> hi
[15:19] <jrib> NielsMkn: you can put everything on one partition, though I'd recommend having a separate /home and something for swap
[15:19] <KylieBrooks> um
[15:19] <KylieBrooks> hello
[15:19] <KylieBrooks> um
[15:19] <FloodBot1> KylieBrooks: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[15:19] <KylieBrooks> ...p
[15:19] <KylieBrooks> so, firfox keeps freezing up
[15:19] <NielsMkn> so there is no need for a /boot partition?
[15:20] <KylieBrooks> so, firfox keeps freezing up
[15:20] <DarsVaeda> is there a drag and drop solution to add new items to the launcher? (not from the dash)
[15:20] <MonkeyDust> !details | KylieBrooks
[15:20] <ubottu> KylieBrooks: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[15:20] <k1l> NielsMkn: not for a regular user
[15:21] <KylieBrooks> MonkeyDust: don'yt quite have them. um, i need to know ow to get ubuntu version
[15:21] <NielsMkn> alright thanks.
[15:21] <MonkeyDust> KylieBrooks  lsb_release -sd
[15:22] <KylieBrooks> it seems that firefox freezes up and takes the whole sysetem with it. ubuntu 12.10
[15:22] <NielsMkn> erm, what should be the size for each of them considering I have around 50GB for ubuntu and 6 GB of RAM.
[15:23] <KylieBrooks> MonkeyDust: did u need any more detailss
[15:23] <MonkeyDust> NielsMkn  10GB /    7GB swap     the rest /home
[15:23] <NielsMkn> alright.
[15:24] <MonkeyDust> KylieBrooks  what are you doing exactly?
[15:24] <KylieBrooks> MonkeyDust: browsing ...
[15:24] <Miebster> Is there a linux application that can get email and calendar from exchange using activesync?  It's an ironic question because android has this.
[15:25] <k1l> DarsVaeda: if you start that program you can rightclick on the icon and select: keep in launcher
[15:25] <NielsMkn> last question for now, do you recommend install ubuntu 12.10 or should I go for previous versions?
[15:25] <MonkeyDust> Miebster  linux has Zimbra and Zarafa
[15:25] <DarsVaeda> "lock to launcher"?
[15:26] <k1l> NielsMkn: you should decide if you want long-term-support or if you are fine with upgrading once in a while
[15:26] <KylieBrooks> MonkeyDust: i said i'm browsing
[15:26] <ThinkT510> NielsMkn: more recent apps: 12.10; longer support period: 12.04
[15:26] <k1l> NielsMkn: so that would be installing a) 12.04 LTS or b) 12.10
[15:26] <MonkeyDust> KylieBrooks  what did try before you came here?
[15:26] <k1l> DarsVaeda: smth like that, yes
[15:27] <MonkeyDust> KylieBrooks  did you try*
[15:27] <NielsMkn> well I'll be using ubuntu mainly for developing android apps and blender actually
[15:27] <ThinkT510> KylieBrooks: is flash involved?
[15:27] <KylieBrooks> MonkeyDust: decreasing screen resolution as someone thought hardware
[15:27] <KylieBrooks> thinced: no
[15:27] <KylieBrooks> er
[15:27] <KylieBrooks> ThinkT510: no
[15:27] <DarsVaeda> lock to launcher does not work
[15:27] <DarsVaeda> the program is actually eclipse which I installed in /opt/eclipse4
[15:28] <DarsVaeda> but eclipse 3 is installed also, if I start eclipse 4 and lock it to the launcher, it starts eclipse 3
[15:30] <KylieBrooks> MonkeyDust: u here

[15:37] <mathi> ThinkT510: it seems that only interface is what takes resources
[15:37] <DataMatrix> apg: some process is using files on your home dir or you have mounted a partition on a subdirectory of home folder
[15:38] <ThinkT510> mathi: as usual
[15:38] <ThinkT510> mathi: a cli environment is always going to be lighter than any desktop
[15:39] <apg> DataMatrix: how can I know a program that has not quitted to the time my system almost poweroff?
[15:39] <mathi> ThinkT510: but Lubuntu makes not only UI lighter, but also limit the default applications.
[15:39] <ThinkT510> mathi: you said you don't want a desktop
[15:40] <AngryBird> hlw guys, i've installed win 7 .. i want to know how to configure firewall on windows 7

[15:41] <AngryBird> saale kutte

[15:42] <wachpwnski> If I download ubuntu server, is that a good way to go about installing a minimal desktop environment?
[15:42] <ThinkT510> mathi: the default apps for the server are different too, no gui apps at all so what you say is a moot point
[15:42] <apg> Datamatrix: I do not mount any partition to any subdirectory of my home folder. So, I guess, there is a program using a file that prevent my  home folder from cleanly unmounted.
[15:43] <MonkeyDust> wachpwnski  there's alos mini ubuntu, it's also an installer, liker ubuntu-server

[15:43] <DataMatrix> apg: that is one option, the other is that gnome mounts on .gvfs for flash sticks and etc. and your GUI is not exiting and unmounting those properly (if you use gnome)
[15:44] <wachpwnski> what does the server version have?
[15:45] <MonkeyDust> wachpwnski  other partitioning, other default apps, no GUI
[15:45] <mathi> ThinkT510: when I install will I have to choose the type of File System ?
[15:45] <ThinkT510> mathi: ext4 is default
[15:46] <apg> datamatrix: do you know the way to make sure which program is not exiting?
[15:47] <DataMatrix> apg: login into a root terminal (open terminal then type "sudo -s" without quotes), type: echo -e "lsof -f -X | grep /home > /var/log/shutdown.log" > /etc/rc0.d/S39homeuse
[15:47] <wachpwnski> min is the best way to go then?
[15:48] <calimero_82> hey guys
[15:48] <DataMatrix> apg: then make the script executable: chmod 0755 /etc/rc0.d/S39homeuse
[15:48] <ThinkT510> wachpwnski: unless you have bandwidth issues then yes
[15:48] <DataMatrix> and then shutdown. then start your computer and check the file /var/log/shutdown.log
[15:48] <MonkeyDust> wachpwnski  "best" depends on what you expect and prefer
[15:48] <craigbass1976> jrib, thanks.  How do I know whether the network or samba starts up first?
[15:48] <calimero_82> how can i connnect my samsung c3750 via usb on ubu 12.10?
[15:48] <apg> datamatrix: okay, I'll try it now.
[15:49] <DataMatrix> apg: I am not currently able to test this, but this is the base concept to log what is using your home just before /etc/rc0.d/S40umountfs -> ../init.d/umountfs start executes
[15:49] <wachpwnski> so mini is like of like the freebsd style ubuntu :D
[15:49] <craigbass1976> calimero_82, is it android?  Do you have to tell the phone what mode to connect in first?
[15:49] <wachpwnski> install only what is needed, and download and compile what is wanted
[15:49] <calimero_82> no it's an old phone
[15:49] <ThinkT510> wachpwnski: not compile no, binary packages

[15:59] <Azmuth> i want to install win7 after ubuntu 12.10
[15:59] <Azmuth> i don't know how to backup mbr ?
[16:00] <MonkeyDust> Azmuth  it's possible, but win7 ruins GRUB, so you'll have to repair it
[16:00] <BluesKaj> Azmuth, install windows first then ubuntu
[16:00] <Azmuth> BluesKaj: i can
[16:00] <Azmuth> i can't
[16:01] <mimor> Azmuth: have you seen this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot#Installing_Windows_After_Ubuntu
[16:01] <BluesKaj> Azmuth,  why ?
[16:01] <seel> speaking of installing, what's the difference between wubi and dual-booting?
[16:01] <BluesKaj> !wubi | seel
[16:01] <ubottu> seel: Wubi is an Ubuntu installer for Windows users that allows you to install and uninstall Ubuntu like a Windows application, in a simple and safe way. http://wubi-installer.org/support.php and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide for troubleshooting. Please  file bugs at http://launchpad.net/wubi/+filebug. For Ubuntu Oneiric/11.10 http://releases.ubuntu.com/oneiric/wubi.exe
[16:01] <MonkeyDust> seel  wubi creates a space inside windows, dual-booting alongside windows
[16:02] <Azmuth> BluesKaj: i have lots of software installed on ubuntu and if  i uninstall it then i have to start again...
[16:02] <zell> hello how can I on my ubuntu disabled auto calibration of my microphone ?
[16:02] <zell> disable*
[16:02] <seel> ok
[16:02] <ThinkT510> seel: wubi is a ubuntu installation in a file inside windows (avoid using it if possible)
[16:02] <seel> so speed doesn't really factor in or anything, just how it's installed basically
[16:03] <ThinkT510> seel: yes
[16:03] <BluesKaj> Azmuth, so you can install windows beside ubuntu , then use live media ubuntu to reinstall grub
[16:03] <seel> ThinkT510: well, I'm using wubi atm as I can't install ubuntu on here
[16:03] <Azmuth> BluesKaj: that's what i am looking for...
[16:03] <ThinkT510> seel: wubi was never meant as a long term solution, more of a testing ground before a proper install
[16:04] <BluesKaj> seel, wubi isn't a real install , it's afile the runs in windows
[16:04] <xente> when I log out from my unity session, there are still several processes running. Namely: unity-music-daemon, unity-shopping-daemon, and gvfsd-trash. If I log in again, these processes are duplicated. Does anyone know why these processes won't die unless I explicity kill them?
[16:05] <zell> How can i disable microphone auto-calibration ?
[16:05] <seel> I understand that but still have no way (that I know of) to install ubuntu other than that, with little point in doing so in the first place
[16:05] <zell> (when i speak using, mumble or any VOIP device, microphone become lower, and people i speak with, can't hear me anymore
[16:05] <ThinkT510> seel: a vm is a much better solution
[16:06] <zell> i just checked my system configuration
[16:06] <Azmuth> nvm
[16:06] <zell> and even if I emplify signal
[16:06] <Azmuth> thanks for help
[16:06] <zell> it lows back ...
[16:06] <Azmuth> i got my answer
[16:06] <zell> any idea ?
[16:06] <boulderdave> For some reason, even though I'm passing flat=True into values_list(), when I try to append the results to a list, its saying I can only concatenate list (not "ValuesListQuerySet") to list ... what the hek?? http://dpaste.com/882711/
[16:07] <seel> so does wubi still allow windows to get something like a virus or any other crap using windows might have happen?
[16:07] <MonkeyDust> boulderdave  what are you trying to do?
[16:07] <xente> seel: no, not if you are booting ubuntu in wubi
[16:07] <k1l> seel: can you rephrase?
[16:08] <seel> I've never done a vm and this laptop's dvd drive is broken so couldn't download an iso but have full install on my desktop
[16:08] <MonkeyDust> seel  wubi will get you frustrated, it's a pseudo-install, you'll think ubuntu is no good
[16:08] <k1l> seel: you can use a usb stick
[16:08] <xente> wubi is a great solution, but bad disk performance
[16:08] <k1l> seel: i recommend to avaoid wubi
[16:08] <ThinkT510> seel: if wubi has access to your windows partition then yes, files (including viruses) can get transfered to windows
[16:08] <k1l> *avoid
[16:09] <seel> ok, no clue if it has access to that or not actually
[16:09] <boulderdave> append the value list to another list
[16:09] <denisnikulin> seel: no, any virus from windows won't affect your wubi ubuntu installation
[16:09] <ThinkT510> !usb | seel
[16:09] <ubottu> seel: For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[16:09] <k1l> wubi installs a ubuntu into a container into the windows partition. i recommend to do a native ubuntu install on seperate partitions
[16:09] <MonkeyDust> boulderdave  in what language? better go to the proper channel
[16:09] <seel> I just know my girlfriend mainly prevers windows and I prefer ubuntu full-time now, though my desktop is nice once I can access that via ssh lol
[16:10] <boulderdave> MonkeyDust, ah crap. sorry !  thought i was in #django
[16:10] <boulderdave> my bad!
[16:10] <denisnikulin> seel: try ubuntu + windows in virtualbox ;)
[16:10] <seel> much better performance?
[16:10] <seel> vm, I mean?
[16:10] <denisnikulin> seel: for linux - yes. if you want desktop os
[16:10] <xente> the problem with wubi is limited to poor disk performance, file system corruption if there is a crash (on both the windows side and linux side) but other than that, it's just fine.  a native install has much better disk performance. other than that, it's just fine
[16:10] <ThinkT510> seel: xp in vbox has good performance

[16:11] <Baribal> Hi. I just f### up badly and de- and reinstalled a production MySQL server. Is there any way to recover its data?
[16:11] <denisnikulin> agree about xp on vm - very good performance
[16:11] <MonkeyDust> xp in virtualbox works nice
[16:11] <k1l> xente: as issues here proof its quite common that windows gets corrupted and ubuntu cant start, too.
[16:11] <seel> ok, well I've never done a vm as said and am running win7 otherwise so is it gonna cost anything?
[16:11] <MonkeyDust> xp... the only windows i can love
[16:12] <ThinkT510> seel: virtualbox is free and open source
[16:12] <xente> kil: you haven't proven that. the corruption is only if someone powers off the machine without going through shutdown
[16:12] <seel> ok
[16:13] <ThinkT510> seel: you'd need your own windows install media to make a windows vm
[16:13] <k1l> xente: most supporters here dont like wubi because of that problems. they are quite common. thats what i mean. its theoretically a good feature.
[16:14] <seel> windows install media?
[16:14] <ThinkT510> seel: your own copy of windows
[16:14] <xente> kil: I agree with you on that. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone beyond those who want to evaluate ubuntu. but it's great to get windows friends to try ubuntu with limited risk
[16:14] <ThinkT510> seel: with your purchased activation key

[16:16] <xente> gnome-terminal -e <command>
[16:16] <ThinkT510> seel: have you never used virtual machines before?
[16:17] <seel> as I said, no, never
[16:17] <rjagathe> Hi ...I was using ubuntu 12.04(upgraded often right from 10.10) w/o any problem for long time.But... I tried to upgrade to 12.10.it resulted in a disaster .My system fails to boot.Can anybody help?
[16:17] <ThinkT510> seel: seriously, try ubuntu in a vm, go download virtualbox
[16:17] <ThinkT510> seel: virtualisation is great
[16:17] <seel> I've heard about them but have never done them as I thought you'd have to be in windows and then load up ubuntu or something and didn't want to login to windows
[16:18] <rjagathe> How to download virtual box from win xp. Right now I am chatting from it only?
[16:18] <ThinkT510> rjagathe: go to the website
[16:18] <xente> seel: to use a vm in windows, you need to login to windows
[16:18] <arunkumar413> ubuntu not recognising the memory card on my laptop
[16:19] <Wulf> I'm at the login screen of 12.04. Shutdown does not work, nothing at all happens. I also checked the logs. Nothing. How can I fix that?
[16:19] <minas> xente, I tried it but it opens and closes instantly
[16:20] <rjagathe> ThinkT150: which site?
[16:20] <arunkumar413> why is ubuntu not recognizing the sd memory card plugged into the memory card slot on my laptop
[16:21] <xente> minas: because once you run that command, it ends and the terminal will exit. perhaps what you want to use is a script with zenity
[16:21] <ThinkT510> rjagathe: if you want to download virtualbox then it would make sense to go to the virtualbox website, more help can be found in ##windows
[16:22] <minas> xente, But I also tried gnome-terminal -e touch x.txt and the file isn't created
[16:22] <rjagathe> ThinkT150:How it can help me in booting my ubuntu?
=== chiluk_away is now known as chiluk
[16:22] <ThinkT510> rjagathe: you just asked how to install virtualbox in winxp, how is this related?
[16:22] <xente> minas: in that case, try gnome-terminal -e "sh -c \"touch x.txt\""
[16:23] <rjagathe> ThinkT150:I was just complaining abt my ubuntu 12.04 not booting after a failed upgrade to 12.10
[16:24] <arunkumar413> i have windows 7 on my laptop and i installed ubuntu inside windows. I shrinked the C drive to create some extra space to install other linux os.

[16:24] <minas> xente, works, thanks :)
[16:24] <xente> minas: :)
[16:26] <seel> so in a nutshell, I login to win to use ubuntu and can use it like I normally would but when it windows, start a vm and run ubuntu from there as though it's installed whenever I want to use it inside windows, and nothing I do will effect windows/nothing win does will effect ubuntu?
=== dziegler is now known as dziegler_off
[16:26] <seel> just brand new to it is all... but am reading about it now
[16:26] <xente> seel: that's right. you can run several vm's as well, depending on your resources. kinda nifty
[16:28] <BluesKaj> seel, you may have to enable virtualization in the bios
[16:28] <seel> and even though is required to login to windows (grr lol) it's better than wubi though a dual-boot is obviously the best choice other than a full install?
[16:28] <BEC> arunkumar413, indeed; the max # of "Primary" partition is 4; what u can do is create an "extended" partition which can have as many logical partitions as u wish
[16:28] <arunkumar413> decoder_: how to create an extended partition
[16:29] <BluesKaj> dual boot is a full install , one partition is windows , the other is ubun tu , seel
[16:29] <seel> right, was just meaning dual-boot/install over windows
[16:29] <arunkumar413> is logical volume bootable

[16:42] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: by doing so, you can create logical partitions within
[16:42] <bazhang> sogeking99, yes they do
[16:43] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: if you need more space, resize other partitions
[16:43] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: i shrinked the c drive to create some extra space but i'm not able to create partitions on that
[16:43] <BluesKaj> arunkumar413, 2 of the primaries are recovery and Windows page file partitions , which you may have to sacrifice iirrc
[16:43] <seel> ok, well glad I got help here and I appreciate that, will keep that in mind
[16:43] <sogeking99> bazhang, would sudo apt-get purge remove the environment and all the programs it downloaded also?
[16:44] <sogeking99> thanks jhutchins
[16:44] <jrr> jhutchins: in other words, what did adding the account under "Online Accounts" do?
[16:44] <bazhang> sogeking99, no it would not
[16:44] <jhutchins> jrr: That's an exchange question, but it should mean that it's accessible from the internet, possibly the web interface.
[16:44] <BEC> BlueEagle, t5ae4: maybe im getting it wrong, but he's trying to install it inside Windows; no need to remove a partition! All he needs is some space on one partition (which obviously he should have)
[16:44] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: what's the error  message when you create a partition?
[16:44] <BEC> arunkumar413,
[16:44] <bazhang> !puregnome | sogeking99
[16:44] <ubottu> sogeking99: If you want to remove all !Kubuntu packages or !Xubuntu packages and have a default !Ubuntu system, follow the instructions here: http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/pureubuntu
[16:44] <arunkumar413> BluesKaj: i shrinked the c drive which gave me 200 GB of extra space.
[16:44] <jhutchins> jrr: I'm only certified through exchange 5, it's been a while.
[16:45] <sogeking99> Okay thanks
[16:45] <jrr> jhutchins: I'm talking about ubuntu's system settings -> online accounts
[16:45] <bazhang> sogeking99, the same applies for other desktop environments as well
[16:45] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: the error message is "its not possible to create more than 4 primary partitons"
[16:45] <jrr> ubuntu apparently has the ability to log in to that account, but I'm not sure it's doing anything with it
[16:45] <jhutchins> jrr: Then I have no idea what you've done.
[16:45] <sogeking99> Okay
[16:45] <jrr> alright, thanks
[16:45] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: dude.. you should delete one existing partition first ok?
[16:46] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: then create a extended partition
[16:46] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: but doing so may corrupt my windows 7
[16:46] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: what's the problem in deleting the last partition
[16:48] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: delete a partition which will not affect your current installation
[16:48] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: it contains some hp tools and it may also contain UEFI
=== dniMretsaM_away is now known as dniMretsaM
[16:49] <jhutchins> arunkumar413: Before anything, if you're going to be messing with partitions you need to have a backup anyway.  Clonezilla will let you make an image backup that you can restore exactly as it was.  Are all of the partitions listed as primary, not extended?
[16:49] <arunkumar413> jhutchins: think they are all primary
[16:50] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: can you delete the third?
[16:50] <sogeking99> do I want kdm or lightkdm?
[16:50] <ThinkT510> sogeking99: lightdm is default
[16:50] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: it says it contains some hp tools
[16:50] <sogeking99> ok thanks

[16:51] <usr13> djono: no
[16:51] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: the second?
[16:51] <BluesKaj> !virus
[16:51] <ubottu> Antivirus is something you don't need on !Linux. except where files are then passed to windows computers (perhaps using samba), See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Antivirus

[16:52] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: second contains linux
[16:52] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: you have to reinstall linux
[16:52] <djono> my facebook keeps getting hacked even after i change my password. possible keylogger?
[16:52] <usr13> djono:  You need to change passwords to everything, (at least every few months).
[16:52] <usr13> djono: We have no way of knowing.
[16:53] <djono> i changed it 5 times in the last 3 days
[16:53] <cristian_c> Hi
[16:53] <t5ae4> djono: check your email, see if you notice anything suspicious
[16:53] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: there is 200GB of unallocated but it is now showing in fdisk -l
[16:53] <usr13> djono: Again, look at other services you use, such as email.
[16:53] <cristian_c> I've enabled suspend with: dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend
[16:53] <t5ae4> arunkumar413: you cannot allocate unless you delete a primary partition..
[16:53] <djono> nothing suspicous on my email. ive changed those passwords aswell
[16:54] <usr13> t5ae4: May not even see anything suspicious, just change the password to it and see.
[16:54] <MonkeyDust> djono  then contact facebook
[16:54] <t5ae4> djono: yeah possibly keylogger
[16:55] <cristian_c> It works but when I try resume, a kernel panic occurs or desktop is unusable
[16:55] <djono> any ideas how to check and get rid of a keylogger?
[16:55] <cristian_c> How can I solve this problem?
[16:55] <usr13> djono: Ubuntu doesn't have anything to do with facebook.  But one thing for sure is that a lot of shenanigans goes on on Facebook, (no matter what OS you use).
[16:55] <arunkumar413> t5ae4: i'll better take a backup and do it tomorrow

[17:31] <tripelb> MonkeyDust: the output of that command is Ubuntu 11.04 (duh, good to double check I suppose)
[17:32] <usr13> stuffthatspins: You didn't have a script someplace, like in   /etc/network/if-up.d/  ?

[17:33] <Mars___> Hi there! I own a system76 laptop (Mode: Panp5) running Ubuntu 11.04. As of this morning, the laptop spontaneously shut off on me, and when I go to turn it on again, I am able to make it run for a minute or two before spontaneously shutting off again. Booting it again shortly after makes the system beep. I am unsure of what causes this problem.
[17:33] <usr13> stuffthatspins: Oh. ok
[17:33] <usr13> stuffthatspins: Well, just re-do it.
[17:33] <lhavelund> Mars___: Sounds like it could be a temperature issue to me.
[17:34] <stuffthatspins> i know. royk told me i have a deprecated call.
[17:34] <lhavelund> Definitely sounds like a hardware problem rather than a software one.
[17:34] <usr13> Mars___: Yea, check to see if the fan runs
[17:34] <tripelb> Can anyone support me on 11.04 which will not display the GUI properly. Hardware fine (per dell tests). Won't support unity ( Ubuntu tells me) won't support gnome (that's what I see, GUI does not display, keeps vanishing.) I am at a text CLI now. [I don't have internet nor a copy of 12.04 but I have copy of the 2009 and 2006 if that matters.]
[17:34] <usr13> Mars___: May just need a good cleaning.

[17:35] <tripelb> LCD screen
[17:35] <usr13> !modeset | tripelb
[17:35] <Mars___> user82: The fan certainly runs, and lhavelund, I am positive that the system is not overheating. I came back early this morning to find the system completely cooled down. I booted it again to find that it only works for a short time before shutting down again.
[17:35] <usr13> !nomodeset | tripelb
[17:35] <ubottu> tripelb: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[17:36] <usr13> (just guessing   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^)
[17:36] <Mars___> The system beeping worries me the most however because I have never seen it do this in all my years of owning the system.
[17:36] <tripelb> What is the command to see how much ram I have?
[17:36] <Mars___> I would provide a memtest86+ if I could, but the system fails even through that.
[17:37] <usr13> Mars___: Try a bootable CD or USB
[17:37] <usr13> Mars___: But sounds a whole lot like a hardware problem.
[17:38] <SierraAR> I'm wanting to create a 250GB partition, then install windows xp on it. I have ubuntu 12.04 already installed, and gparted is saying that if I resize/move the existing partition it can make ubutnu fail to boot
[17:38] <SierraAR> Ubuntu*
[17:38] <SierraAR> Any google search results seem to be for existing windows 7 installs, or a blank hard drive
[17:38] <usr13> SierraAR: Probably because there is data in the way
[17:38] <Mars___> Yeah, that was my first guess, usr13.
[17:38] <Mars___> I'll probably have to look into it..
[17:38] <Mars___> Could the video driver be running bad? Is that a consideration?
[17:39] <stuffthatspins> usr13, does this look right to you?
[17:39] <stuffthatspins> http://primaxstudio.com/interfaces
[17:39] <usr13> Mars___: I doubt it.
[17:39] <stuffthatspins> this was working in 10.0.4 but 12.0.04 only the main ip works.
[17:40] <SierraAR> usr13, Is there a guide on creating a new partition to install windows on with an existing ubuntu install?

[17:41] <tripelb> I  see no output but mine. am ihere?
[17:41] <stuffthatspins> yes. but RoyK says it's deprecated. I should use. up ip addr add 66.117.230.217/25 dev eth0
[17:43] <stuffthatspins> but that just adds at runtime. this config file worked before… now i have no extra IPs except the first
[17:43] <Mars___> usr13: Well, I'm certain this could be a hardware issue because I tried booting it again, but this time it started beeping right before the system shut off. I was in the System Utilities BIOS menu.

[17:44] <usr13> stuffthatspins: I don't know, maybe Royk was correct.  Need to check around a bit I guess.

[17:44] <fego> you can refer the section "Installing Windows After Ubuntu". SierraAR
[17:45] <usr13> Mars___: Depends on the bios, but many of them are pretty similiar.  Could be that the memory chip(s) just need to be re-seated.
[17:46] <Azmuth> any way to fix my issue ?

[17:56] <Mars___> Just waiting for that crash to happen. :P
[17:57] <Mars___> AAAND there it is
[17:58] <Mars___> usr13: The system booted normally, however I'm only able to use it for about 1~3 minutes at most before it spontaneously turns off as if it was a Hard Reset.
[17:58] <tripelb> jhutchins: thanks. I haven't been on Ubuntu for over a year and I forgot.
[17:59] <Vivekananda> face a weird problem although I somewhat know what the cause is. My /home suddenly reports disk full although disk usage analyzer adds up to a much lower value. Then I run fsck on boot and things go back to showing 1.5 gigs free. I know my hard drive is failing but what can I do otherwise ??
[17:59] <Vivekananda> I am using lucid on a 5 yr old laptop
[18:00] <usr13> Mars___: Boot to BIOS and look around.  You might see something dealing with the processor, fan or heat related info.
[18:00] <ubuntu-tester> Vivekananda: the best you can do is to backup all that valuable until it's too late
[18:01] <usr13> Vivekananda: Time to by a new HD?
[18:01] <tripelb> OK jhutchins I do have a meg of ram. What I do notice is that this LCD screen cut off the first few columns. I gave away my last CRT monitor. I think I will try a different LCD screen. Bit that one didn't show the bios correctly. So I switched so I could change the boot order and start up Ubuntu. This is a FreeCycle machine. It passed the dell hardware test I ran it thru.

[18:04] <JuJuBee> What is easiest way to transfer /home from one server to another?
[18:04] <ubuntu-tester> Vivekananda: because damaged area is on ubuntu pattition and not on xp partition
[18:05] <blkadder> JuJuBee: scp it.
[18:05] <Mars___> Oh, usr13. It appears my fan ISN'T spinning for some reason..?
[18:05] <Mars___> I guess this is a temperature problem then.
[18:05] <Mars___> I wasn't able to find any information in my System BIOS about the temperature.
[18:05] <JuJuBee> blkadder: OK, I would need to sudo correct? and how can I preserve perms?
[18:06] <ubuntu-tester> Vivekananda: you can repartition the drive to cut off bad area from usage. This will require enough free space on other media to move data
[18:06] <JuJuBee> blkadder: I didn't think scp preserved file ownership
[18:07] <blkadder> JujuBee: Generally. You can preserver permissions and UID/GID but they will only show up properly if they match on the destination host.
[18:07] <Vivekananda> ubuntu-tester: Yep I understand that but then I was just wondering that if the part is damaged then why would fsck show the free 1.5 gigs then go back to being randomly unavailable. But I guess I see the reason is that the drive is failing. :(. does repartition automatically remove a problem ??
[18:07] <ubuntu-tester> JuJuBee: or rsync
[18:07] <blkadder> JujuBee: You might have better luck with rsync over ssh.
[18:07] <morfeo_81> how can se if one library are installed?
[18:08] <ubuntu-tester> Vivekananda: no, it only gives chance to that
[18:08] <Mars___> I guess the fan went bad I guess..?
[18:09] <Mars___> That would be my best guess, otherwise I'm not sure what to make of this.
[18:09] <Vivekananda> You mean that while partitioning in Gparted I will get an option to "clean/not choose" bad sectors??

[18:14] <llutz> morfeo_81: sudo apt-get install libbam-dev
[18:14] <JuJuBee> Maybe I should just create the user dirs on remote and have them use rsync to move thier stuff over

[18:15] <morfeo_81> llutz:thanks..!
[18:16] <blkadder>  JujuBee: That would be a good idea.
[18:16] <blkadder> If you want to preserve ownership.

[18:31] <jhutchins> You can use vigr, which will validate any chnages you make to the group file, but it's usually better to use usermod to make changes like that in a shadow password system.
[18:31] <usr13> nabblet: You can use the useradd command:  sudo useradd -G audio nabblet
[18:32] <jhutchins> seel: Why involve the desktop if the android is playing the movies?
[18:32] <usr13> (where nabblet is the actual user you need to add)
[18:32] <usr13> nabblet: But I should also tell you that you'll need to log out and back in again for changes to take effect.)

[18:39] <vifanq> MonkeyDust: my laptop can't boot from USB. I have however an old linux & grub there already installed, so maybe I can use it to "redirect" boot to the ubuntu installation USB stick ?
[18:39] <ubuntu-tester> Ziber: ok, skip this step

[18:46] <qbmaniac> I'm having a problem with system time in my ubuntu server
[18:46] <qbmaniac> the clock says 12:46 which is right
[18:46] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester: resize/move is greyed out.
[18:46] <usr13> nabblet: Did you see it playing?  Dit show the progress of the files playing?
[18:46] <qbmaniac> but when I do a backup, or when I run a PHP script, or anything else, a different time comes up
[18:47] <nabblet> usr13, yes
[18:47] <usr13> nabblet: Oh, I see, never mind.....
[18:47] <Ziber> It's busy apparently.
[18:47] <Ziber> Hm
[18:47] <qbmaniac> I tried syncing hardware time with software time, what else can I do?
[18:47] <usr13> nabblet: So it works but only by using sudo?
[18:47] <usr13> nabblet: But when you do it without sudo, does it give error?
[18:48] <arunkumar413> usr13: the memory card is not detecting, how is it showing in the /proc/meminfo
[18:48] <jhutchins> qbmaniac: Is the hardware clock set to local time or GMT?
[18:48] <ubuntu-tester> Ziber: show gparted screenshot
[18:48] <usr13> arunkumar413: I dono, but it's there.
[18:48] <qbmaniac> jhutchins: that's the problem, I tried to set it to local time but it didn't work. Not sure what I did wrong. How can I make sure it is in local time?
[18:48] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester: http://www.liber.in/gparted.png
[18:48] <nabblet> usr13, ok i uninstalled alsa-base and alsa-utils but now neiter root nor normal user work
=== richardb1anson is now known as richardbranson
[18:48] <nabblet> usr13, thought alsa may interfer with pulse
[18:48] <Harlin> just installed ubuntu 10 (LTS) ? after a restart, i log in and it logs me out. i know it's not the password because if i type a wrong pasword it says password failed? any ideas?
[18:48] <nabblet> usr13, reintsalling alsa
[18:48] <usr13> arunkumar413: It's the only memory chip in there?  There is only one memory chip, right?
[18:49] <Stuttergart> My MBP is not booting to X. Says that video and input are horked.
[18:49] <Vi> guys i ran nmap to try and map a network. i got 5 hosts : 10.1.1.1,2,3,5 and 6. i can traceroute all of them except for 10.1.1.2.. so now im kinda stuck.
[18:49] <Stuttergart> Does anyone know how to trigger an X config/detection run?
[18:49] <jhutchins> qbmaniac: You have to tell the system that it's local, not GMT.  The issue is that some subsystems don't use a locale, and/or ignore the timezone setting.
[18:49] <usr13> nabblet: pulseaudio is a sound server that runs on top of alsa. (You can not uninstall alsa.)
[18:49] <arunkumar413> usr13: yes, there is only one memory slot on my laptop, i inserted the memory card into the slot
[18:49] <usr13> arunkumar413: It's working.
[18:50] <Ziber> ubuntu-tester: ideas?
[18:50] <ubuntu-tester> Ziber: you are not on liveusb
[18:50] <Ziber> Yes, i am.
[18:50] <nabblet> usr13, the funny thing is: root complains about [pulse] Init failed: Connection refused and failed to initialze audio driver 'pulse' but it plays music - while normal user does not complain but is mute
[18:50] <arunkumar413> usr13: but i cant see it in the file manager
[18:50] <ubuntu-tester> Ziber: then why sda5 is mounted?
[18:50] <nabblet> usr13, didn't knwo that
[18:50] <usr13> arunkumar413: File manager?  You don't see RAM in a file manager.
[18:50] <nabblet> usr13, seems like root may bypass pulse
[18:50] <Ziber> I have no idea. What makes you think it is?
[18:51] <usr13> arunkumar413: Are you talking about a USB flash drive?
[18:51] <xibalba> is there a good speed test app in the repo?
[18:51] <arunkumar413> usr13: i want to see the memory card contents not the ram
[18:51] <usr13> arunkumar413: Oh, I'm sorry.
[18:51] <usr13> nabblet: pastebinit /etc/group  #Send resultin URL
[18:51] <ubuntu-tester> arunkumar413: show your syslog, see command above
[18:52] <usr13> arunkumar413: mount |pastebinit
[18:52] <ubuntu-tester> Ziber: mounted partition prevents moving/resizing

[18:57] <Avenger001> Someone knows if there are Linux drivers for a a Magalhaes computer?
[18:59] <jhutchins> Avenger001: Never heard of the brand.  You'll probably have to figure out what hardware it uses.
[18:59] <usr13> auronandace: unplug it and plug it back in again and give show us syslog (afterward)
[18:59] <ubuntu-tester> Avenger001: Caixa Magica, as Google suggests
[18:59] <Avenger001> jhutchins: It is basically an Intel computer, manufactured in Portugal.
[18:59] <usr13> auronandace: tail -n20 /var/log/syslog |pastebinit
[19:00] <ubuntu-tester> usr13: he has gone
[19:00] <nabblet> usr13: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1546355/
[19:00] <jhutchins> Avenger001: It may use fairly standard hardware, although some laptops don't.  Best answer is "try it and see".
[19:01] <Avenger001> jhutchins: I bet it does, but looking on the webpage, I only found Windows drivers....
[19:01] <MonkeyDust> Avenger001  try it, then you are the expert
[19:01] <jhutchins> Avenger001: Yep, that's how it goes.  Linux drivers tend to be built into linux rather than supplied seperately.

[19:03] <Stuttergart> does anyone know how to reconfigure X to fix ?
[19:03] <Stuttergart> dpkg-reconfigure xserver-org doesn't do anything

=== jordan_ is now known as jordan
[19:09] <Stuttergart> usr13: I don't seem to have that file at all
[19:10] <Stuttergart> only xorg.conf.failsafe
[19:11] <usr13> nabblet: How many users do you have on this system?
[19:11] <usr13> nabblet: Just one, right?
[19:12] <usr13> nabblet: sudo useradd -G audio benedict
[19:12] <jhutchins> Stuttergart: Most systems use autodetect for configuring X these days, so no xorg.conf.
[19:13] <nabblet> usr13: i was thinking about falling back to this too :(
[19:13] <Testman> hello its me
[19:13] <jhutchins> Stuttergart: you did dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg?
[19:13] <Stuttergart> jhutchins: y, it doesn't do anything. Just right back to prompt.
[19:13] <nabblet> usr13: i think that by my minimal system some settings/daemons that are required for proper access management are not installed or configured
[19:14] <Stuttergart> jhutchings: I get a 0 exit code from the command
[19:14] <jhutchins> Stuttergart: many dms use their own config file anyway.  I'm not familiar with lightdm.
[19:14] <usr13> nabblet: I'm sure it will work.  I don't understand https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Audio/TheAudioGroup It's not really telling us how to solve your problem so... I dono...  This should work ok for now.  Only problem it says is that it will deny other users audio.  Well yea, it will,(untill you add them to audio group)... so what?
[19:15] <Stuttergart> I'm google'ing for how to generate xorg.conf on 12.10 and can't find anything. :\
[19:15] <usr13> nabblet: you can always change it later if you find out what the real solution should be....
[19:15] <jhutchins> When a user logs in via the DM, it should add them to the basic hardware groups automatically.
[19:15] <g105b> I've installed Google Chrome using apt-get but I'd like to change to the beta version - how do I do it?
[19:15] <usr13> Stuttergart: what video card do you have?
[19:15] <nabblet> usr13: i will try to isntall gdm first - maybe it will fix all that
[19:15] <usr13> nabblet: you have sox  Right?
[19:16] <nabblet> usr13: sox?
[19:16] <usr13> nabblet: I doubt that gdm will do anything.
[19:16] <usr13> nabblet: Yea sox  sudo apt-get install sox
[19:17] <nabblet> usr13: sox is just an audio converter
[19:17] <Stuttergart> usr13: I have one of the Intel Ivy Bridge's. macbookpro9,2
[19:17] <nabblet> usr13: 90MB dependcies for gdm :O
[19:18] <usr13> nabblet: sox is the Swiss Army knife of audio manipulation
=== dankest|away is now known as dankest
[19:18] <nabblet> usr13: i don't want to manipulate it - i want to hear it ;)
[19:18] <nabblet> usr13: i think i once fixed womething with gdm
[19:18] <usr13> nabblet: Ok, never mind.    sudo useradd -G audio benedict
[19:18] <nabblet> usr13: since it is also responsible for permission maangement
[19:18] <usr13> nabblet: Maybe your right, gdm is small
[19:19] <usr13> nabblet: I didn't know that...
[19:19] <nabblet> usr13: if that does not work i fall back to adding myself to the audio group
[19:19] <usr13> ok
[19:19] <usr13> nabblet: It's not going to hurt anything to add yourself to audio group
[19:19] <llutz> usr13: useradd will fail if the user exists, you need usermod and you don't want to use usermod -G without -a unless you are really sure about what it might break
[19:19] <usr13> nabblet: We need to do more research on this ...
[19:20] <nabblet> usr13: jep
[19:20] <usr13> nabblet: llutz has a good point
[19:20] <mrthg_> which is a good mail system for ubuntu for sending and recieving
[19:20] <llutz> usr13: well, that point is mainly for you...
[19:20] <usr13> I told you wrong.
[19:20] <nabblet> ?
[19:21] <llutz> usr13: sudo adduser username groupname
[19:21] <usr13> nabblet: Ok,     sudo usermod -G audio benedict
[19:21] <llutz> usr13: NO
[19:21] <jhutchins> usr13: NO
[19:22] <ubuntu-tester> mrthg_: you mean mail server?
[19:22] <llutz> usr13: that will kick benedict from all other groups
[19:22] <usr13> Oh yea...ok
[19:22] <mrthg_> yup lol
[19:22] <mrthg_> seems i didnt really think of that
[19:22] <llutz> usr13 not a nice effect for a sudo-user
[19:23] <usr13> adduser benedict audio
[19:23] <usr13> and then   ls /etc/group  #To make sure it looks as it should.
[19:23] <jhutchins> nabblet: have a quick look at the usermod manpage, then you want usermod -a -G audio <user>
[19:23] <mrthg_> is postfix any good as mailserver?
[19:24] <ubuntu-tester> mrthg_: good if you know it
[19:24] <usr13> cat /etc/group  && adduser benedict audio && cat /etc/group
[19:24] <Corny_> If /dev/sda has only one partition, is there difference between specifying /dev/sda or /dev/sda1 as parameter to ddrescue (or whatever)?
[19:24] <bekks> mrthg_: sure, it is.
[19:24] <mrthg_> problem is that i wouldnt know xD
[19:24] <ubuntu-tester> mrthg_: exim is also popular
[19:25] <jhutchins> usr13: I think you should make a policy of a) reading the manpage for any command you suggest, and b) trying the commmand yourself before posting it.
[19:25] <usr13> Corny_: Yes, it's still gonna be sda1
[19:25] <mrthg_> exim you say, gonna check it out :P
[19:25] <usr13> jhutchins: Good advise
[19:25] <Corny_> usr13: Yes as in no difference? O.o
[19:26] <jhutchins> Corny_: You can see what's available by using sudo fdisk -l
[19:26] <jhutchins> Corny_: if sda1 isn't there, it's going to give you an error.
[19:26] <dpurgert> Corny_, no /dev/sda1 is the partition.  /dev/sda is the harddrive itself
[19:27] <jhutchins> dpurgert: Some USB devices are accessed directly as the root device.
[19:27] <nabblet_old> wow - gdm is so fat (dependcies)
[19:27] <Corny_> Uh.... So when running ddrescue, which one should I specify?
[19:27] <jhutchins> !dm
[19:27] <llutz> Corny_: sda1
[19:27] <Corny_> Thanks.
[19:27] <djono> i ran clam tk and found 16 threats is there a way i can get more info on the threats
[19:27] <Avenger001> I found a solution.
[19:27] <Avenger001> Thanks to everyone.
[19:28] <llutz> Corny_: makes it easier to mount an image later, as you don't have to use offsets etc.
[19:28] <MonkeyDust> djono  exciting! screenshot please?
[19:28] <ubuntu-tester> Corny_: specifying sda have more sense as partition table can be corrupted
[19:28] <djono> how do i post  a screen shot
[19:28] <Corny_> Is it dangerous to put 0 in /sys/block/sdh/device/timeout to speed up rescue?

[19:30] <nabblet_old> lol - why does apt-get install gdm get me the whole unity system - wtf?
[19:30] <djono> i can get a log if u want
[19:31] <elena-IK> what desktop environment would you recommend for a senior who never used a computer before?
[19:31] <usr13> nabblet_old: I was afraid of that.
[19:31] <dpurgert> elena-IK, whichever one I (you) are most familiar with, as it's easier to help
[19:32] <ubuntu-tester> elena-IK: depends on tasks, but gnome 2 will do i guess
[19:32] <jhutchins> elena-IK: The idea of unity is to be simple to use and easy to learn; they don't have any learned habits so it really doesn't matter that much.
[19:34] <MonkeyDust> elena-IK  is the senior already familiar with a GUI?
[19:34] <nabblet_old> usr13, sound works - i was right
[19:34] <nabblet_old> usr13, gdm fixed me the permssion trouble - but at what price!
[19:34] <MonkeyDust> elena-IK  ignore my question
[19:35] <nabblet_old> usr13, i think i will have to find out what of gdm's 1000 deps is responsible for the permissions
[19:35] <djono> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1546455/
[19:35] <nabblet_old> usr13, it's a pitty that gdm installs so much cr*p with it... have a look at the things that come with it -.-
[19:36] <nabblet_old> usr13, my laptop is unusable right now XD
[19:36] <dpurgert> what'd you do nabblet_old ?
[19:37] <djono> has anyone checked it out?
[19:37] <xibalba> why do the CentOS folks consider Ubuntu a 'toy' ?
[19:38] <dpurgert> because they can xibalba
[19:38] <nabblet_old> dpurgert, i did a minimal install cuz i'mma linux pro - but all i got was pain and agony. then i installed, remebering the same painn from the 12.04 install, that a missing gdm is responsible for a lot of premission troube so i installed it - what i didn't know is that gdm invites the whole unity stuff on my system
[19:38] <MonkeyDust> xibalba  part of the OS flame war, i guess
[19:38] <nabblet_old> dpurgert, but at least gdm enabled sound for my normal user - before only root had sound
[19:39] <ubuntu-tester> djono: i see only packed win exes and obfuscated javascripts
[19:39] <nabblet_old> usr13, gdm also got my webcam working
[19:39] <dpurgert> nabblet_old, ouch ... that's going to be one amazing mess to unravel.
[19:39] <djono> so are they threats?
[19:39] <nabblet_old> usr13, dpurgert to reinstall or not to reinstall, that's the question

[19:40] <v0lksman> /wc
[19:40] <djono> could any of those be key loggers?
[19:40] <MonkeyDust> djono  ask in #winehq
[19:41] <ubuntu-tester> exes are not (to linux at least). javascripts can contain browser/flash/reader exploits
[19:41] <nabblet_old> dpurgert, in that case i would also kill grub - then i could not boot any onf my OSs
[19:41] <dpurgert> djono, on the bright side -- they're all windows crap ... but yeah, nuke them all from orbit.  It's the only way to be sure.
[19:41] <djono> the java scripts come from jdownloader

[19:42] <eliezer> Hi Guys,,,i need to edit this file in order con have my backlight dim working = sudo gedit /etc/default/grub i cant remember wich line is it and the typo,i remember is something with vendor cpi
[19:42] <nabblet_old> dpurgert, since grub is in the MBR?
[19:42] <FRO5T> i always install my distros under /
[19:43] <ubuntu-tester> FRO5T: bitter experience?
[19:43] <FRO5T> none
[19:43] <eliezer> and then upgrade grub
[19:43] <dpurgert> nabblet_old, you're right --> if you do rm -rf / it'll kill everything under / (the entire OS).  GRUB should be on the MBR, but I think there are still some configs kept in /boot (or somewhere) ...
[19:44] <dpurgert> nabblet_old, though to be honest -- when I'm doing an install, I go for formatting the entire disk

[19:46] <z2389> Hi, I'm trying to partition my hard drive to dual boot Windows7 and Linux. The drive that I just shrank was D:. I shrank it 80gb for linux, however the 80gb is labelled FREE SPACE and not "unallocated". Is this a problem?
[19:46] <Coded1> is there an alternative to jdownloader?  jDownloader is ok but it's slow even on an ok system.  The best I get from google are links from '08-09.  Anything newer/not java dependant?
[19:46] <hissa2> hello people
[19:46] <z2389> D: is labelled as a logical drive.
[19:47] <nabblet_old> dpurgert, well that got me the whole unity stuff - just for gdm

[19:47] <Baribal> Hi. I guess this is a bash question. I have a file with a list of files (one file per line). How do I delete all of the listed files?
[19:47] <FRO5T> free space means free space which is Currently not used
[19:47] <nabblet_old> dpurgert, i don't think that gdm requires unity....

[19:47] <usr13> z2389: Ubuntu will install on the free space
[19:47] <FRO5T> like having 10gb free from 20gb

[19:50] <Coded1> Baribal: cat file | xargs /bin/rm
[19:50] <eliezer> i dont want to crash
[19:51] <Baribal> Thanks, Coded1. :)
[19:51] <escott> eliezer, you probably want it on the GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT line. im not sure when the non-default one is used
[19:51] <Coded1> Baribal: make sure you check the file though.  If one line has a '/' you might make more problems then the command is worth
[19:52] <eliezer> escott, thanks
[19:52] <mbeierl_> Baribal, but, do note that will not work for files that contain spaces as the 'for file in ' also uses space as a delimiter, so "My Documents" would attempt to delete My and then Documents
[19:52] <Baribal> Coded1, already on it. :) I want to purge everything to do with keystone after a botched devstack deployment, but I don't want to i.e. delete pythons keystone module.
[19:53] <Baribal> mbeierl_, duly noted.
[19:53] <nabblet_old> party is over - the only reason why i upgraded from 12.04 ot 12.10 is becuase my system freeezes severa times a day
[19:53] <nabblet_old> and now it happens again
[19:53] <nabblet_old> i will look at it tomorrow >(
[19:53] <mbeierl_> nabblet_old, perhaps silly question, but have you run a ram test?
[19:53] <Baribal> Ubuntu has indeed become familiar territory for the average Windows user, nabblet_old :)
[19:54] <nabblet_old> mbeierl_, already did
[19:54] <mbeierl_> nabblet_old, I've seen random freezes caused by badly seated ram frequently enough
[19:54] <mbeierl_> k
[19:54] <FRO5T> the ram problems can occur only in some specific situations...
[19:54] <jhutchins> nabblet_old: Could be a hardware problem.
[19:54] <sylphie> nabblet_old; do the freezes have anything in common?
[19:55] <FRO5T> freezes can be from motherboard or your gpu
[19:55] <nabblet_old> sylphie, they annoy me :)
[19:55] <sylphie> nabblet_old; besides that
[19:55] <Cong> what's the switch to say I don't want extra packages?
[19:55] <jhutchins> nabblet_old: gdm probably needs a certain amount of gnome, but installing all of gnome is probably overkill and bad packaging.
[19:55] <nabblet_old> jhutchins, i think so too
[19:56] <ubuntu-tester> Cong: which ones?
[19:56] <sylphie> nabblet_old; does your machine runs other OS's without lockups?
[19:56] <nabblet_old> sylphie, i was not able to do deeper test - and i wont do the now
[19:56] <jhutchins> nabblet_old: I have succeeded in getting things like that fixed by filing bugreports, but you have to know what the actual dependency errors are.
[19:56] <Cong> ubuntu-tester, it goes sometin like --no--dependencies
[19:57] <sylphie> nabblet_old; I mean does it run ok on windows/dos/whatever?
[19:57] <Cong> ubuntu-tester, I want to install alacarte with out extra packages.
[19:57] <nabblet_old> sylphie, have to test that - it ran well for ubuntu a long time
[19:58] <jhutchins> Cong: Theoretically, any of the "extra" packages are required for your target package to run, like code libraries and such.
[19:58] <sylphie> nabblet_old; that's the simplest way to see if you have a hardware error or whether ubuntu is the problem
[19:58] <jhutchins> Cong: Sometimes the packagers aren't very careful about what they include.
[19:58] <nabblet_old> sylphie, jep
[19:59] <jhutchins> Cong: I think there may be a "recommends" feature, but I don't know if that's on or off by default.
[19:59] <escott> jhutchins, Cong on by default in synaptic off by default in apt-get
[19:59] <Esor> irc_hide_version = 1
[19:59] <Esor> whopsie sorry
[20:00] <escott> jhutchins, Cong all controlled through /etc/dpkg files
[20:00] <Cong> esor /set irc_hide_version on
[20:00] <Esor> thank you
[20:00] <crackguy> can i use 'wget -i file.txt' and store each page with a different name all in one command?
[20:01] <sylphie> It's too late, we know you're using xhcat
[20:01] <FRO5T> wget http://
[20:01] <escott> crackguy, page?
[20:01] <crackguy> escott page/file/image
[20:02] <escott> crackguy, if you wget one file there is one file? are you doing a recursive pull and not wanting to keep the structure?
[20:03] <crackguy> escott -i can download multiple files stored in links.txt and i want to rename them 1-100 etc...
[20:03] <Cong> Oh, I found it, it's --no-install-recommends.
[20:04] <escott> crackguy, just turn on noclobber and set them all to the same filename

[20:23] <sylphie> Fanfy; Firstly, their linux full package is actually a precompile binary, so you would just run the "install" program and hope it works
[20:23] <Fanfy> Yeah....did that lol it doesn't...
[20:24] <Fanfy> Ubuntu really hates me...lol
[20:24] <sylphie> Fanfy; your other option is to get the source code they link right underneath that, and build the package yourself
[20:24] <FRO5T> or vice versa :D
[20:25] <ztgu> MonkeyDust: If i use nomodeset will my graphics perfome worse or better? I have the radeon driver ( the reason for nomodeset, it because I have a black screen on resume on suspend)

[20:26] <sylphie> Fanfy; building a package from source isn't necessrily hard, it can be just a few commands
[20:26] <ubuntu-tester> ztgu: you can also try to find kernel biuld that works. did it work earlier?
[20:27] <Fanfy> ._. lol a few commands I have no clue how to put in lmao

[20:32] <tripelb> Should I erase the 11.04?
[20:32] <Fanfy> Lol I tried the windows version I can't use it cause it saves to the Windows 7 OS on my harddrive. Then I can't find it...tried that already. And I can't use windows 7 cause it doesn't load on my laptop...

[20:33] <ztgu> ubuntu-tester: Do you know what it does? I have heard that is the same/similar to booting in nomodeset. do you know if nomodeset is slower than my existing setup?

=== squidnipples is now known as squidnips
[20:34] <sylphie> Fanfy; It's not your computer's fault, it's fault of the programmers at Magic set editor. If they are going to distribute pre-compiled linux binaries, they should test them first
[20:35] <ubuntu-tester> ztgu: of course i don't. you can always revert it back (to black :). or just boot with nomodeset once and test
[20:35] <escott> ztgu, nomodeset has nothing to do with speed
[20:35] <Fanfy> sylphie - and  then they should write the simplest of directions...x.x for people like me. Apparently it works for other people. Just not me...
[20:35] <ztgu> escott: or performance.
[20:35] <sylphie> Fanfy; and you could possibly guild it from source with less than five easy console commands
[20:35] <dpurgert> Fanfy -- what're you trying to do?
[20:36] <escott> ztgu, correct
[20:36] <Fanfy> sylphie - Yeah I dunno what that means...lol
[20:36] <dpurgert> oh ... build a package/program from source ... yeah -- it can defintiely be easy
[20:36] <Fanfy> dpurgert - trying to get flippin Magic Set Editor to download lmao
[20:36] <escott> ztgu, it is a necessary step to move the rendering in kernel which is performance related, but modesetting itself is not a performance thing
[20:37] <dpurgert> ah
[20:37] <ztgu> escott: what do you mean with: move the rendering in the kernel which is performance related?
[20:38] <sylphie> dpurgert; http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/ provides either a precompiled linux binary which won't install or source code
[20:38] <dpurgert> well, let's see
[20:38] <Fanfy> Yep and it won't download for me. Sadly. And I need it cause otherwise I have to keep revisiting my library.
[20:38] <dpurgert> um
[20:38] <ztgu> escott: nomodeset can't be to good on performance (I think). I have heard that adding the nomodeset parameter instructs the kernel to not load video drivers and use BIOS modes instead until X is loaded.
[20:39] <dpurgert> the "precompiled binary" seems to be a tgz file ... gimme 5 minutes to get it
[20:39] <escott> ztgu, if the kernel doesn't modeset then the kernel doesn't know the state of the card so it cannot manage buffers on behalf of applications. with the modesetting in kernel then the kernel can directly manage buffers which allows applications to simply tell the kernel to swap the front and back buffer instead of asking another priv'ed process to do the swap on their behalf
[20:39] <Fanfy> o.o okay I also found this http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net/node/1918 but it confuses me even more and didn't help.

[20:41] <cjhorn> join #hackers
[20:42] <escott> ztgu, at present though the only thing that is swapping buffers is the compositor through X so with the current architecture it shouldn't matter that much performance-wise, with wayland it may be different because the compositor may be able to take itself out of the loop (thats my understanding)
[20:42] <dpurgert> Fanfy, HDD = Hard Disk Drive

[20:44] <ztgu> escott: Well, did not quite get a total understanding of everything you just said. but I will give nomodeset a try to see if it fixes my resume from suspend problem. Disabling kms for your specific gpu is the same as nomodesetting?

[20:46] <Fanfy> Tells me some denied thing.
[20:46] <Frank_Leach> it isnt the hardware problem...software for sure, and its installing the firmware thats the problem
[20:46] <dpurgert> you have to download the file from sourceforge -- grab the 47M one (full install)
[20:46] <ztgu> escott: ty,
[20:46] <Fanfy> yep got it
[20:46] <dpurgert> OK
[20:46] <Fanfy> I installed it. It's sitting in a folder in my home thing
[20:46] <escott> ztgu, at present my understanding of X and opengl is that the application writes to a buffer, and then compiz or some other compositor tells the kernel to draw it. with kms the kernel knows the state of the graphics card and can manage memory on behalf of it. the kernel (with the help of the compositor) could then map a page in the applications address space to a page in the graphics card DMA range, and the kernel could then do the dra
[20:46] <escott> wing without further involvement of the compositor. i think thats what DRI2 does over DRI. but the kernel can't do that unless it knows the state of the card
[20:47] <dpurgert> OK, so you extracted the tarball already?
[20:47] <Frank_Leach> go to software source and do...what?
[20:47] <ubuntu-tester> Frank_Leach: firmware? did you update card's fw?

[20:50] <ubottu> Fanfy dpurgert: checkinstall (source: checkinstall): installation tracker. In component universe, is optional. Version 1.6.2-3ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 114 kB, installed size 502 kB
[20:50] <vitimiti> hallo
[20:51] <ubuntu-tester> Frank_Leach: yes, start with lspci and pastebin output
[20:51] <Fanfy> i'm so confused...
[20:51] <ztgu> escott: Do you think using the fglrx driver instead of the radeon driver is a good option to fixing the suspend issue?
[20:51] <dpurgert> escott -- meh, fair enough
[20:52] <Fanfy> ._. I've no idea whut you guys are saying!
[20:52] <escott> Fanfy, apt keeps track of files on the system so they can safely be removed later. if you sudo ./install then apt won't know about it. you should use "checkinstall" which will make a *.deb file that you can install so that apt knows what you are doing
[20:52] <Frank_Leach> pastebin?
[20:52] <Frank_Leach> :-(
[20:52] <sylphie> bbl
[20:52] <ioria> Frank_Leach: it should be just one line regarding the wireless ... paste here
[20:52] <Fanfy> Soo I just type in checkinstall ./install?

[20:53] <escott> ztgu, i would think that radeonhd driver (ie open source) would be better than fglrx (proprietary) for suspend issues

[20:53] <tripelb> I want to install an Ubuntu right over an old Ubuntu partition. How do I do that? I cannot figure it out.
[20:53] <benftwc> Hi
[20:53] <dpurgert> Fanfy -- no, Checkinstall is a program that you can get so you can build a *.deb package to install (so apt knows about it) ... not entirely necessary, but makes things easier
[20:53] <ztgu> That's what I am uding right now
[20:53] <ioria> Frank_Leach:  try additional drivers
[20:53] <ztgu> escott: That's what I am using right now
[20:53] <MonkeyDust> tripelb  delete the ubuntu partition, then install the new ubuntu - after backup
[20:53] <Frank_Leach> tied...it said my drivers were up to date
[20:54] <Fanfy> -dies- So I have to install checkinstall and then use it with this magic card editor file?
[20:54] <benftwc> I've a problem to do an upgrade from 10.10 to latest ubuntu, that said to me "network problem" but update work fine ...
=== dani is now known as Guest91745
[20:54] <ioria> Frank_Leach:  /etc/network/interfaces ?
[20:54] <dpurgert> fanfy, no you don't _have_ to (honestly, I don't do a lot of things that apt "knows" about)
[20:54] <Frank_Leach> /etc/network/interfaces
[20:55] <Fanfy> well okay then I really don't care if it comes off...i just want it on. Soooo how do I do it? I'm still stuck at looking at the magic folder in terminal o.o
[20:55] <dpurgert> ok
[20:56] <Fanfy> So what do I type to install to make it work?
[20:56] <ztgu> escott: I am now going to reboot my machine after changing GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash" to GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR=`lsb_release -i -s 2> /dev/null || echo Debian`
[20:56] <ztgu> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nomodeset" in the file gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub . I will reboot my system and share my results
[20:56] <dpurgert> if you're in the directory, then ./install should do it
[20:56] <Fanfy> just ./install none of that sudo stuff?
[20:57] <dpurgert> you have two options
[20:57] <dpurgert> 1. ./install (as yourself) or 2. sudo ./install
[20:57] <dpurgert> apparently, it'll get installed to different places (because of rights) and it really doesn't matter
[20:57] <ubuntu-tester> Frank_Leach: try other drivers. read http://aengakug.notlong.com
[20:58] <dpurgert> if you're the only user of the PC, then ./install (without sudo) should be sufficient
[20:59] <Fanfy> oh gosh
[21:00] <Fanfy> Okay well it didn't work and my thing went all weird o.o
[21:00] <dpurgert> oh, what'd it do?
[21:00] <Fanfy> Well I couldn't send a message thing so I had to close out of this and reenter o.o and then it told me there was already a directory made or something i dunno...
[21:01] <dpurgert> what?
[21:01] <Fanfy> failed to create symbolic link
[21:01] <Fanfy> whatever that means
[21:01] <dpurgert> it couldn't make a symlink -- what's the full text of the error?
[21:01] <Fanfy> and cp: cannot create directory and theres another that has a bunch of other stuff
[21:01] <Fanfy> ahm..
[21:01] <ubuntu-tester> Fanfy: if you want real help show exact output
=== epzil0n is now known as Guest2461
[21:02] <Fanfy> Oh well
[21:02] <Fanfy> I can't send what it says
[21:02] <dpurgert> ?
[21:02] <calimero_82> bye
[21:02] <dpurgert> throw it into pastebin
=== len is now known as Guest29743
[21:03] <Fanfy> I copied and pasted and then it made my text  thing all black and with different color letters and when i hit enter it doesnt send just goes to a new line
[21:03] <ubuntu-tester> Fanfy: whatever you do there seems it disconnects you every time :)
[21:03] <Fanfy> Oh i disconnect myself so I can send a message lol
[21:03] <dpurgert> oh
[21:03] <Fanfy> I don't have a 'send' button anywhere o.o i can't find it
[21:03] <Sgt_Shultz> calm, patience and planning are required, fanfy how much space avaiable on drive ?
[21:03] <dpurgert> it's because the binary package is dumb and isn't built for Ubuntu
[21:03] <ubuntu-tester> Fanfy: you copy selected text from terminal with Ctrl+Shift+V
[21:03] <Fanfy> oh no..
[21:04] <LeMike> xrandr query doesn't show my usb2vga device. does anyone know how to fix this?
[21:04] <dpurgert> OK
[21:04] <dpurgert> lessee ... I don't know which distro thinks your bin is in /home/yourname/bin but they based it off that package
[21:04] <Fanfy> Well ctrl and v doesn't work eitherrr
[21:05] <ubuntu-tester> Fanfy: and Shift
[21:05] <Fanfy> See told ya guys my computer hates me.
[21:05] <Fanfy> Yeah tried shift too
[21:05] <jhutchins> Fanfy: What terminal program are you running?
[21:05] <Fanfy> terminal.
[21:05] <Fanfy> Just says Terminal o.o
[21:05] <Fanfy> Are there specific ones?
[21:05] <TarantulaFudge> hey guys
[21:06] <jhutchins> Fanfy: Probably gnome terminal.  Yeah, there's a bunch.
[21:06] <ubuntu-tester> Fanfy: guess you have to find your friend and ask him to help again
[21:06] <dpurgert> looks like /usr/local/bin or /usr/local/sbin would be the ones (or /usr/bin or /usr/sbin)
[21:06] <Fanfy> O.O Oh gosh I gotta go!
[21:06] <Fanfy> My aunt is gonna killll me .__.
[21:06] <jhutchins> Fanfy: Hold mouse and drag highlights?
[21:06] <Fanfy> yeah did that and copied and paste to here and it goes all weird
[21:06] <jhutchins> Fanfy: DOn't paste here.
[21:07] <LeMike> fanfy what does "echo $SHELL" say?
[21:07] <Fanfy> Anyways. Thanks for trying guys. I'll have to try again another time I can get to the library
[21:07] <jhutchins> Fanfy: Come back wehn you have time.
[21:07] <Fanfy> echo what?
[21:07] <LeMike> echo $SHELL
[21:07] <ztgu> I am back
[21:07] <Fanfy> Oh yeah I'll try to come back if I can find  this chat again...someone referenced me here from somewhere else lol
[21:07] <cuddylier> hi
[21:07] <cuddylier> How do I use apparmor?
[21:07] <FRO5T> Oh my back
[21:08] <dpurgert> ugh .. lessee ... which bin do I have write permissions into ... hmm...?
[21:08] <Fanfy> Well gotta go thanks everyone! I'll try to find you again if I can haha
[21:08] <LeMike> i need help with my x11. the usb2vga device isn't listed in "xrandr --query" . any idea how to fix it?
[21:09] <sybariten> I'm on Ubuntu 12.10 and i'm interested in trying out this whole virtualization thing, on a laptop with 3.6 (??) Gb RAM. Should i just go ahead and DL a virtualbox .deb file from Oracles site, and throw it at dpkg ?
[21:09] <ztgu> escott: I changed quiet splash" to quiet splash nomodeset" I booted into a console, and when running startx i got: fatal error, no screens found. or something like that-. So i changed back to quiet splash". Any Idea???
[21:09] <ThinkT510> sybariten: vbox is in the repo
[21:09] <ubuntu-tester> LeMike: try too boot with it plugged
[21:09] <sybariten> ThinkT510: vbox = virtualbox?  I thought it was an "oracle owned" thing and thus wouldnt end up in ubuntu repos
[21:10] <ThinkT510> sybariten: its gpl, oracle hasn't changed the license
[21:10] <dpurgert> sybariten, it's in the repos :)
[21:10] <dpurgert> I just checked
[21:11] <sybariten> dpurgert: ThinkT510 : alrite! i'll give it a try.
[21:11] <FRO5T> oracle vm virtualbox
[21:11] <sybariten> thanks
[21:11] <Cong> I used the script here and now I lost my menus I think. http://wiki.lxde.org/en/Main_Menu#Menu_Editor
[21:12] <ztgu> escott: Do you have any idea on what that can be?
[21:12] <Cong> How do I recreate them?
[21:13] <TarantulaFudge> Having some issues getting the netinstall to work with my edubuntu cd image extracted onto my web server, when I check the logs it says that the "mirror does not support the specified release (precise)"
[21:14] <sybariten> next question: i havent used ubuntu (graphically) in five years or so. How do i make certain that this fresh install of mine, uses the right drivers for my graphics hardware?  (compaq laptop with AMD Radeon HD 6310 graphics)
[21:14] <ubuntu-tester> Cong: ask at #lubuntu
[21:14] <ikonia> TarantulaFudge: .......does the mirror have that release on it
[21:14] <sybariten> coz it feels kinda ... sloppy. Just a bit.
[21:14] <Cong> ubuntu-tester, there's not one active there.
[21:14] <trijntje> Hi all, to install ubuntu on a system with UEFI I had to switch to legacy bios , but now I can't boot windows OR ubuntu when I re-enable UEFI. How can I fix this?
[21:14] <ikonia> sybariten: it will offer what it things are the best, it's up to you to research what the best are
[21:14] <jhutchins> sybariten: /var/log/Xorg.0.log
[21:15] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: the guide on the net said I could extract my .iso file under /ubuntu/
[21:15] <ikonia> TarantulaFudge: that wasn't the question
[21:15] <sybariten> jhutchins: whaddamilookinfor
[21:15] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: the iso is edubuntu precise 12.04.1
[21:15] <ikonia> TarantulaFudge: that wasn't the question
[21:16] <jhutchins> sybariten: See what driver it says it's using. It may report trying all of them, it's a mess to wade through.  I don't know if xrandr will report the driver, sometimes you can wade through the sytems settings in the GUI and see it.
[21:16] <ubuntu-tester> Cong: #lxde maybe
[21:16] <sybariten> jhutchins: hmmm ok
[21:17] <jhutchins> TarantulaFudge: What do you mean "extracted"?
[21:17] <ThinkT510> sybariten: lsmod will show you what modules are loaded, the open source driver is used by default
[21:17] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: its got the release file and stuff I'm not really sure what you mean it is the full DVD iso of edubuntu precise 12.04.1 extracted to /ubuntu/ on my webserver, when I netboot and select my mirror and enter the url it says the release is not supported
[21:17] <ikonia> TarantulaFudge: what "mirror" is it using
[21:17] <jhutchins> ThinkT510: xorg driver is not a kernel module.
[21:18] <LeMike> nope ubuntu-tester . still not there. i opened it at askubuntu http://askubuntu.com/questions/244799/usb2vga-device-not-listed-as-output-device
[21:18] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: what do you mean by mirror
[21:18] <ThinkT510> jhutchins: the graphics driver will have a kernel module loaded
[21:19] <ikonia> TarantulaFudge: sorry, you shouldn't be doing a netinstall if you don't know what a mirror is
[21:19] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: the mirror is my webserver with the iso contents... correct???
[21:19] <ikonia> you don't just extract an ISO
[21:19] <ikonia> it needs to have a software repository
[21:19] <cub> is there a way to turn off window preview (when multiple instances of a program are running) in unity and use somethign simpler ?
[21:20] <ThinkT510> cub: changing compiz settings can break unity
[21:20] <ubuntu-tester> LeMike: look in kern.log. was it detected?
[21:20] <cub> didn't ask what would break it
[21:20] <cub> just asked if there is a way
[21:20] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: am using this guide https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LocalNet says I can just extract the disc
[21:20] <cub> a safe way of course
[21:21] <ikonia> extracting the disk is not a mirror - so I don't know why it says that
[21:21] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LocalNet#From_a_local_server
[21:21] <JakeR5555> hello
[21:21] <ikonia> TarantulaFudge: same response
[21:21] <JakeR5555> sdfzsdf
[21:21] <ikonia> JakeR5555: great contribution, thanks
[21:21] <JakeR5555> thanks...
[21:21] <JakeR5555> is there a way to get unoffical updates for natty ?
[21:22] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: so I have to download the 25gb mirror?
[21:22] <ikonia> JakeR5555: unofficial ? like what ?
[21:22] <JakeR5555> something which is up to date from the linux comunity ?
[21:22] <JakeR5555> software and patches
[21:22] <sybariten> ThinkT510: jhutchins: on another track -- this "software sources" thing, "additional drivers" tab, is that of any use? it says "this device is using the recommended driver". I htink the open source radio button was chosen, but i also have two proprietary choices.
[21:22] <ikonia> JakeR5555: many people host PPA's and mirrors, find one
[21:22] <JakeR5555> you tell me which one
[21:22] <ikonia> TarantulaFudge: no, just enough to do the install
[21:22] <ikonia> JakeR5555: no
[21:22] <JakeR5555> TELLMMMEEE
[21:22] <ikonia> JakeR5555: you find one from someone you trust
[21:22] <ubuntu-tester> cub: unity switcher has some settings in ccsm. try at your own risk
[21:22] <JakeR5555> i trust you
[21:23] <ikonia> I don't host a natty mirror
[21:23] <ThinkT510> sybariten: use whichever you want, i prefer to stick to the open source drivers
[21:23] <sybariten> ThinkT510: ok so you dont think i can expect a tremendous increase by using propritary? Well i could just try, i suppose....
[21:24] <ubuntu-tester> JakeR5555: try backports repo
[21:24] <sybariten> increase = performance increase
[21:24] <ikonia> if the release is dead, so is back ports
[21:24] <ThinkT510> sybariten: i've never used the proprietary drivers so i couldn't tell you
[21:24] <sybariten> ok
[21:24] <sybariten> thanks
[21:24] <trijntje> TarantulaFudge should probably just have installed apt-cacher on his server
[21:25] <adac> Hi. How can I pause a gif?
[21:25] <ikonia> pause ?
[21:25] <ikonia> it's an image
[21:25] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: sorry got disconnected
[21:25] <ikonia> no need to apologise
[21:25] <adac> wel stop it at a certain point
[21:25] <adac> ikonia,
[21:25] <ikonia> adac: it's an image
[21:25] <ikonia> adac: you don't "stop it"
[21:26] <TarantulaFudge> ikonia: so there is no way to avoid the 25gb mirror?
[21:26] <ThinkT510> ikonia: maybe he has an animated gif
[21:26] <ubuntu-tester> adac: you mean gif animation i guess
[21:26] <trijntje> TarantulaFudge: what is the goal you are trying to accomplish?
[21:26] <adac> ikonia, animated is a number of pics
[21:26] <adac> as far as I thought
[21:26] <TarantulaFudge> trijntje: just want to do a standard netinstall of edubuntu
[21:26] <ikonia> adac: open it in an image editor and view the frames
[21:26] <TarantulaFudge> trijntje: which works fine on the internet, but having trouble setting up local mirror
[21:27] <trijntje> TarantulaFudge: sure, thats easy, just follow the steps on the cd
[21:27] <LeMike> yee ubuntu-tester . found as USBVGA and recognize when it's unplugged.
[21:27] <trijntje> TarantulaFudge: why do you want to use a local mirror?
[21:28] <TarantulaFudge> trijntje: netinstall from internet of full edubuntu environment is so painfully slow even with tons of bandwidth
=== james_ is now known as blitzkrieg3
[21:28] <ThinkT510> TarantulaFudge: if you've already got the iso then why do a netinstall at all?
[21:29] <TarantulaFudge> trijntje: I was under the impression that there might be a way to just use the disc iso as the "mirror" https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LocalNet#From_a_local_server
[21:29] <trijntje> TarantulaFudge: thats weird, but if you have a ton of bandwith just use the direct iso
[21:29] <TarantulaFudge> ThinkT510: got a lot of machines to install and I've got a working PXE boot to the netinstall
[21:29] <ubuntu-tester> LeMike: pastebin that part +/- 5 lines
=== chiluk_away is now known as chiluk
[21:30] <trijntje> TarantulaFudge: if you need to install to a lot of machines, you can install apt-cacher on the server and point your isntallations there
[21:31] <trijntje> that way you only have to download each package once. Just be sure to configure apt-cacher to never remove a package, and remove /etc/apt/apt.conf on the installed machines since it wil keep pointing to your apt-cacher
[21:31] <stuffthatspins> i'm having a apt-get -f install failure…
[21:32] <trijntje> stuffthatspins: what is the error?
[21:32] <stuffthatspins> trijntje: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1546779/
[21:33] <LeMike> got it ubuntu-tester http://pastebin.com/Qbj6SP0M
[21:33] <stuffthatspins> that goes on and on trijntje:
[21:33] <TarantulaFudge> trijntje: I don't really have an ubuntu server is that my only option?
[21:34] <ThinkT510> TarantulaFudge: if you want a local mirror you need to host it somewhere
[21:34] <stuffthatspins> then finally http://paste.ubuntu.com/1546783/ trijintje:
[21:34] <trijntje> TarantulaFudge: well, 'server' is a strong term, you can just as easily install apt-cacher on one of the desktops you installed
[21:34] <jhutchins> TarantulaFudge: Any of the boxes can act as a server.
[21:35] <LeMike> 0711:5100 fits to the lsusb listing
[21:35] <TarantulaFudge> I suppose that could work
[21:35] <trijntje> stuffthatspins: where did you get that package? I cant fid it in the repository
[21:36] <stuffthatspins> trijntje: it's from parallels.they've messed my server up…
[21:36] <trijntje> Hi all, to install ubuntu on a system with UEFI I had to switch to legacy bios , but now I can't boot windows OR ubuntu when I re-enable UEFI. How can I fix this?
[21:37] <dpurgert> trijntje, ouch ... you may need to reinstall one or both OSes (don't really know -- UEFI / secure boot isn't something I've had to fight with yet)
[21:37] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: try aptitude -f install
[21:38] <ThinkT510> !aptitude | jhutchins
[21:38] <ubottu> jhutchins: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[21:38] <ubuntu-tester> LeMike:  the only thing i can suggest is to dive into google results on 'New USB device found, idVendor=0711, idProduct=5100'
[21:39] <mattt_> Is it possible to convert a software raid 0 array to a raid 5 array?
[21:39] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: All those are parallels packages meant for Ubuntu?
[21:39] <stuffthatspins> jhutchins: yes. they are… i'm getting the same errors trying to remove with aptitude -f install
[21:39] <ubuntu-tester> mattt_: raid5 need more drives
[21:39] <jhutchins>  stuffthatspins Looks like a CAD package or something.
[21:40] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: that's not really intended as a removal tool.
[21:40] <mattt_> ubuntu-tester: I've got 4
[21:40] <maxmahem> is there a clever way to leave a package installed as is, but mark it as uninstalled?
[21:40] <zequence>  What would be a meaningful channel/mail list to discuss problems with help.ubuntu.com/community, regarding editing privileges (seems like some new accounts can't edit or add pages)?
[21:40] <stuffthatspins> jhutchins: i think it's part of their "site builder" tools. i've tried  sudo dpkg --force-all -P  art-and-photography-pack1
[21:40] <ubuntu-tester> mattt_: oh
[21:40] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: Check their documentation and see what PHP they recommend/require then try to install that.  If that fails, you can try removing the packages with dpkg.
[21:41] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: Is this from your hosting provider, or is there a URL for the project?  (AFIK parallels is the osx VM host).
[21:42] <zequence> ..never mind :)
[21:42] <stuffthatspins> jhutchins: it's parallels "plesk" server.
[21:42] <LeMike> i will try. thanks ubuntu-tester ! :)
[21:42] <trijntje> dpurgert: it's ok, I made an image of the whole disk before starting, since I figured secure boot would probably mess things up pretty bad :P
[21:43] <stuffthatspins> trijntje: jhutchins: i just want to force remove packages. i don't care for them. can you recommend? this doesn't work either  sudo dpkg --force-all -P
[21:43] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: Ah, I see, both are correct.
[21:44] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: You really need to use their support to fix this, I think it's beyond Debian.  I presume you haven't bought it yet?
[21:44] <jhutchins> stuffthatspins: That's at least the third time today... beyond Ubuntu.
[21:44] <ubuntu-tester> mattt_: seems not for raid0

[21:46] <stuffthatspins> is there a way to "force" package removal? can i remove the package files directly from /var/lib/dpkg/info/ or is that not wise?
[21:47] <dpurgert> tripelb, um ... 9.11 has been EOL for nearly 2 years...
[21:47] <ThinkT510> dpurgert: there is no 9.11
[21:47] <tripelb> Yes ThinkT510 .. Why, earlier version does not tax my hardware. The problem is how to specify - overwrite the existing Ubuntu partition.
[21:48] <dpurgert> ThinkT510, yes huh -- it's called "typo because I need more tea :) "
[21:48] <ThinkT510> tripelb: you mean 9.10, which as has been pointed out is not supported
[21:48] <tripelb> If I had 12.xx it would be the same issue.
[21:49] <ThinkT510> tripelb: to get support here you need to be using a supported release
[21:49] <dpurgert> tripelb, well, if you don't care about the data on the drives, just delete the partitions and start over
[21:50] <ubuntu-tester> tripelb: you can also prepare all partitions in gparted, then just assign them in installer

[21:53] <ThinkT510> usr13: 11.04 is no longer supported either
[21:53] <tripelb> What's going on.
[21:53] <usr13> ThinkT510: Yea, but I'm trying to find out what his issue really is.
[21:54] <tripelb> Nothing happening. Does not say disconnected.
[21:54] <usr13> tripelb: What is  your problem/question?
[21:54] <dpurgert> ... wow ... 8.04 is still going (well, for the server, til april)
[21:54] <usr13> tripelb: If you are installing, why not 12.04 or 12.10?
[21:55] <mjung> Hi. Anyone can give some advise on Intel HD 2000 Graphics GL issues please?
[21:55] <ThinkT510> !lubuntu | tripelb
[21:55] <ubottu> tripelb: lubuntu is Ubuntu with LXDE instead of !GNOME as desktop environment, which makes it extremely lightweight. See https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu - /join #lubuntu for lubuntu support.

[21:58] <borfast> hi everyone. I'm trying to figure out what to do to a user in 12.10 to make it an "administrator". I installed 12.10 on a laptop but something went very wrong and no user was created (I checked /etc/passwd, no user). I booted with the usb disk again, chroot'ed to the partition where ubuntu is installed, added a new user via the command line (uid=1000, gid=1000, just like the regular user created during the installation would have), but now I don't k
[21:58] <borfast> now what else to do to make it be able to use sudo. I know of /etc/sudoers but I also know that it should be possible to do it without modifying that file, because that's how my other laptop is - no reference to my username in there. any clues on how to do it?

[21:59] <escott> borfast, add them to the "sudo" group

[22:01] <dpurgert> KI4RO, no worries ... i've done that more than enough myself :)
[22:01] <dpurgert> borfast, um ... I have no idea
[22:01] <elkingrey> Does Ubuntu still have that bug that prevents clean installs with a USB drive?
[22:02] <borfast> I never used moduser, and trying it just says the command wasn't found. I'll try it with adduser...
[22:02] <usr13> borfast: adduser <user> <group> is good
[22:02] <ubuntu-tester> borfast: do adduser
[22:02] <KI4RO> dpurgert, I guess we all have LOL
[22:02] <usr13> borfast: Or just edit the file
[22:03] <ubuntu-tester> usr13: bad habit imo
[22:03] <hilo> usr13, KI4RO, I ran it with sudo, and I always update before upgrade. What else might I be doing wrong
[22:03] <dpurgert> hilo, might need dist-upgrade

[22:16] <sylphie> so did Fanfy end up with a working install of Magic card editor?
[22:16] <dpurgert> nope sylphie ... he had to bail before we got him set up
[22:16] <sylphie> that's too bad
[22:17] <dpurgert> looks like the issue is caused by the installer assuming some other OS -- tries putting the launcher into $HOME/bin (which we don't have)
[22:17] <sylphie> I suppose a $home/bin could be create for the purpose
[22:18] <dpurgert> it's a really quick and easy fix though -- either run the installer as sudo, or fix the path ...
[22:18] <dpurgert> yeah
[22:18] <Starlight_> Why did Oracle buy Java?
[22:18] <sylphie> corporate greed
[22:18] <Starlight_> They want to own and ruin a free programming system?

[22:19] <ubottu> Starlight_: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[22:19] <sylphie> but does any distro have a $home/bin?
[22:20] <dpurgert> um
[22:20] <bekks> sylphie: Yes.
[22:20] <sylphie> interesting, that would probably be the distro that package was intended for
[22:20] <bekks> sylphie: In your $home, you can define whatever you want, and add it to your $path as you want it too.
[22:20] <Starlight_> Ok! another question then.. Why is Ubuntu messing around with that sidepanel with icon on it.. I used to love Ubuntu until that update..
[22:21] <ubuntu-tester> Starlight_: it's ot either
[22:21] <ThinkT510> Starlight_: you don't have to use unity, there are other desktop environments
[22:21] <sylphie> bekks, I know you can do that, but which distros come with a $home/bin by default?
[22:21] <bekks> sylphie: There is no need to do that by default, since $home is pretty dynamically
[22:22] <Starlight_> Is that off topic?
[22:23] <Starlight_> What is the topic then.. lol
[22:23] <ThinkT510> Starlight_: this channel is for support issues, not discussion
[22:23] <Starlight_> Hm.. Ok! :-P
[22:24] <dpurgert> so, it's a quick and easy fix to the install script -- it should check if $HOME/bin is there, and maybe create it if not (OT ... but interesting to consider)
[22:26] <trijntje> Hi all, I installed ubuntu 12.10 64 bit on a new win8 laptop, and now I cannot access windows any more
[22:26] <mega1> whats a good email server which will connect to a server and collect the emails and sent them round and connect to AD to get user names
[22:26] <dpurgert> mega1, sendmail?
[22:27] <mega1> is it easy to configer
[22:27] <dpurgert> mega1, not in the least ... but then, I've never seen a mail server that was...
[22:28] <mega1> dpurgert: can i get outlook to connect to it
[22:29] <mega1> dpurgert: or some other email program
[22:29] <dpurgert> mega1, should be able to -- IIRC it does have POP and IMAP connectors ... what're you trying to do though exactly?
[22:29] <bekks> mega1: You can use every MUA to connect to a MDA.
[22:30] <dpurgert> and cue bekks with the complete answer :) haha
[22:31] <mega1> want to do a small network with email server
[22:31] <avatar1978> !ciao

[22:32] <jilebedev> Hi - anyone have advice on upgrading clamav on Ubuntu 10.04 from v. 0.96.5 to 0.97.6?
[22:32] <trijntje> Hi all, I installed ubuntu 12.10 64 bit on a new win8 laptop, and now I cannot access windows any more. How can I fix this?
[22:32] <sylphie> mega1; microsoft deliberately make exchange not conform to the same set of standards, so maybe it will work
[22:33] <dpurgert> well, file sharing is easy --> just set up a NFS share (permissions and stuff need considered, but that's not the point)
[22:33] <mega1> dont want to use exchange as i can not aforded it
[22:33] <dpurgert> "full" exchange functionality ... well, that might be a little more difficult, though there are probably a number of mail servers that come close
[22:33] <Mathuin> Hi!  I'm trying to use Emacs within Metacity, and C-d is causing all my windows to minimize.  How do I fix this?
[22:34] <jhutchins> mega1: There are groupware servers available, but they're complex and can be difficult.  Most people use integrated components.
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[22:35] <jhutchins> mega1: Most common/popular mail servers are sendmail (the original), exim, and postfix.  I think postfix is the easiest to configure, but you really do need to know what you're doing with any of them.
[22:35] <ubuntu-tester> mega1: consider using SOGo (http://www.sogo.nu)
[22:35] <jhutchins> mega1: for pop and imap you can either use the old unix standard servers, or the newer combined dovecot which has some additional sercurity options - but also requires more configuration.
[22:36] <jhutchins> mega1: For centralized contacts, you really have to set up an LDAP server, and that can be pretty complex.
[22:36] <jhutchins> mega1: THere are a number of ways to do calendars.  Usually you do an ical format calendar created by a client then use a webserver to host/share them.
[22:36] <dpurgert> yeah ... "Lightweight" doesn't mean "easy" ... ugh
[22:36] <mega1> jhutchins: we dont need to go that far
[22:37] <mega1> just the email server will do for now
[22:37] <jhutchins> mega1: There are packages for webmail as well, like squirrelmail.
[22:38] <sylphie> postfix is considered safer than sendmail
[22:38] <dpurgert> jhutchins, though, that still sits on top of a proper server (sendmail, etc), yeah?
[22:38] <Mathuin> Bah.  Some gconf magic and I'm back to work.  Thanks!
[22:38] <jilebedev> Hi - if I run apt-get upgrade - how confident should I be in not breaking anything? As in, it seems to want to update a bunch of packages, and I'm worried things would break.
[22:38] <dpurgert> jilebedev, very.
[22:39] <jhutchins> I use postfix+postgrey+dovecot+procmai+spamassassin.
[22:39] <escott> trijntje, did you change your boot mode from efi to bios?
[22:39] <jilebedev> dpurgert: You mean I should be very worried?
[22:39] <jhutchins> dpurgert: squirrelmail needs an MTA (sendmail) + an imap server (imapd, dovecot).
[22:39] <dpurgert> jilebedev, no, you asked how confident you should be in NOT breaking anything
[22:39] <jilebedev> dpurgert: right on. Well, just verifying.
[22:40] <jhutchins> mega1: I've used sendmail, postfix, and exim, and I don't agree with people who say sendmail's harder to configure.
[22:40] <trijntje> escott: yes, ubuntu live usb wouldn't even boot with UEFI enabled
[22:40] <dpurgert> jhutchins, simple enough ... trying to wrap my head around sendmail ... and then will proceed to break everything (thank the FSM for virtual boxes)
[22:40] <jhutchins> mega1: Stories about sendmail being insecure are very outdated and only exist because sendmail goes back to before the internet went public.
[22:41] <jhutchins> dpurgert: http://tldp.org
[22:41] <jhutchins> dpurgert: I've got the sendmail book from O'Reilly as well.
[22:41] <jhutchins> On the other hand, debian defaults to exim4 and has very easy ways to do basic configuration.  Not sure what Ubuntu's setup is.
[22:42] <dpurgert> jhutchins, yeah, I picked that one up.  or well, one of them.
[22:42] <jhutchins> Debian lets you do basic configuration with dpkg.
[22:43] <jhutchins> zimbra is an integrated groupware package that does most of the above.

[23:06] <usr13> jhutchins: Cool.  Thanks
[23:07] <bitHipy> sylphie: well the #debian crowd is quite hostile toward ubuntu folks, so I thought it might be mutual
[23:07] <Ikline> Can anyone help with this problem?
[23:08] <dpurgert> Ikline, have you tried an older/known good kernel?
[23:08] <Ikline> I tried every Kernel in the previos kernel list
[23:08] <dpurgert> Ikline, ewww...
[23:08] <dpurgert> maybe something fried
[23:08] <bitHipy> suppose I boot a standard ubuntu CD, and then do "aptitude install netflix-desktop" every time.. will that work?  is that practical?
[23:09] <Ikline> I can access the filesystem from a live cd
[23:09] <jhutchins> According to this, silverlight is now working in wine: http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=24783 - but I like the looks of that app.
[23:09] <Ikline> I did a memtest, and everything passed
[23:10] <dpurgert> Ikline, OK, so something in the kernel(s) you've got installed on the system are shot.
[23:10] <Ikline> what's the best way to figure out where the priblem is?
[23:10] <jhutchins> bitHipy: Unfortunately a lot of online howtos have no date associated, and it can be hard to even figure out what version numbers they're talking about.
[23:10] <sylphie> bithipy; that sounds like a lot of effort. running a playstation3 emulator on your debian machine should be simpler
[23:10] <bitHipy> jhutchins: agreed.. how-tos should be dated
[23:11] <dpurgert> Ikline, um ... don't really know the best way about fixing it ... could be as simple as fixing grub ... or as ugly as needing a new install ...
[23:11] <Ikline> Is there a way to install new and keep existing mysql and apache files?
[23:11] <bitHipy> sylphie: perhaps.  i know the Android emulators struggle with netflix, but that may be due to emulating an ARM chip
[23:11] <jhutchins> Ikline: from the live CD, mount proc and dev on the disk filesystem, chroot to it, and re-install init (and maybe the kernel).
[23:11] <bitHipy> sylphie: is the ps3 based on an x86?
[23:12] <beandog> Ikline: boot off a live cd and run a full fsck
[23:12] <beandog> Ikline: back up as much as you can first, though
[23:12] <jhutchins> Ikline: Yeah - restore them from your backup.
[23:12] <sylphie> bithipy; no idea
[23:12] <Ikline> Ok, that sounds promising, beandog: tried to run fsck and it refused.
[23:12] <beandog> Ikline: what'd it say
[23:12] <dpurgert> and then invest in a UPC :)
[23:12] <beandog> Ikline: what filesystem is on there? ext4? xfs? reiser?
[23:12] <jhutchins> You shouldn't run fsck on a mounted filesystem.

[23:22] <Ikline> I see. I tried fsck -A to no avail
[23:22] <morfeo_81> I have only two lines http://paste.ubuntu.com/1547045/
[23:22] <usr13> Ikline: I just do    fsck -y /dev/sda5
[23:22] <usr13> Ikline: -y just tells it to fix what it can.
[23:23] <Ikline> usr13: fsck.LVM_member: not found
[23:23] <morfeo_81> Any suggestion?
[23:23] <usr13> Ikline: O
[23:23] <usr13> Ikline: Well, I don't use LVM so...
[23:24] <Ikline> Perhaps I should also mention that I am using RAID
[23:24] <sylphie> IJline; software raid?
[23:24] <usr13> Ikline: I don't know if that matters... well yea, maybe if it is software raid....
[23:24] <beandog> Ikline: run cat /proc/mdstat and see if something shows up
[23:24] <Ikline> RAID 1 - hardware RAID
[23:25] <Ikline> ok
[23:25] <morfeo_81> How can set some new enviroment path?
[23:25] <beandog> Ikline: or you may have /dev/md0 or /dev/md127
[23:25] <morfeo_81> How can set some new enviroment path?
[23:25] <beandog> morfeo_81: PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin/new/path"
[23:25] <beandog> morfeo_81: er "export PATH=$PATH:/foo
[23:25] <beandog> you get the idea. -_-

[23:25] <peugi> is anyone using nvidia-current drivers on precise? I have trouble getting it to work on geforce 635m
[23:26] <beandog> Ikline: yah okay
[23:26] <escott> Ikline, hardware raid or fakeraid?
[23:26] <peugi> nvidia-detector says none
[23:26] <usr13> morfeo_81: You need to add something to your PATH?
[23:26] <Ikline> No md0 or md127
[23:26] <trijntje> escott: I'll try that, thanks
[23:26] <morfeo_81> <beandog>:I HAVE THIS ERROR http://paste.ubuntu.com/1547037/ START FORM THIS http://paste.ubuntu.com/1547037/
[23:26] <beandog> Ikline: alright I gotta run, good luck man, just figure out a way to get the raid array assembled (not rebuilt) using mdadm
[23:26] <peugi> i tried to use x-swat ppa to no avail
[23:26] <Ikline> beandog: thanks, have a good one
[23:27] <beandog> Ikline: I'm betting a good fsck will find it and probably fix it.  So don't panic. :)  Just read the docs on how to mount it properly.
[23:27] <Ikline> Sounds good
[23:27] <beandog> good luck
[23:27] <beandog> check out mdadm
[23:27] <morfeo_81> usr13>: yes, but I have some errors after modification of /etc/enviroment
[23:28] <usr13> morfeo_81: So what modification did you do the /etc/environment?
[23:28] <dpurgert> morfeo_81, so, you put in a bad path ... undo it :)
[23:28] <dpurgert> wait
[23:29] <sylphie> So you are running hardware raid 1 (drive mirroring) shouldn't the os see the array as a single disk?
[23:29] <escott> sylphie, Ikline probably doesn't have hardware raid. he has fakeraid
[23:29] <usr13> morfeo_81: For future reference, here is how I add to my PATH:  PATH="$PATH:/opt/gnome/bin"
[23:29] <trijntje> escott: grub-bios does not seem to exist
[23:30] <jonascj> Hi everyone. Does anyone know how one might go about setting up power managements without the whole Gnome-setup? (e.g. using only a simply window manager and the gnome-settings-manager)
[23:30] <dpurgert> usr13, I'm gonna have to steal that ...
[23:30] <escott> trijntje, its called grub-pc
[23:30] <usr13> morfeo_81: ls /home/mauro/bowtie2-2.0.5/
[23:30] <morfeo_81> <usr13>:s on my /etc/enviroment I need to change the code write
[23:30] <usr13> dpurgert: Be my guest ;)
[23:31] <sylphie> escott; IKline said " RAID 1 - hardware RAID"
[23:31] <usr13> morfeo_81: ls /opt/Software/bedtools-2.17.0/bin/
[23:31] <usr13> morfeo_81:  Do you get errors?
[23:31] <Ikline> I am running hardware RAID on an IBM ThinkServer
[23:31] <dpurgert> morfeo_81, agreed -- check to make sure the paths you've added to $PATH are good ... maybe you typoed something (e.g. uppercase instead of lowercase, or dash instead of underscore)
[23:32] <morfeo_81> usr13:if i did that I can see my script but i HAVE the error when I write ecport $PATH
[23:32] <trijntje> escott: ok, I removed it and installed grub-efi, what should I do now?
[23:32] <morfeo_81> usr13:like I write above
[23:32] <escott> trijntje, if you disabled secureboot and set it back to efi that will hopefully be enough
[23:32] <morfeo_81> usr13:I don't get error if I use ls
[23:33] <usr13> dpurgert: Actually just   PATH=$PATH:/dir/dir   works
[23:33] <trijntje> escott: ok, i'll try it out, thanks!
[23:33] <dpurgert> usr13, same difference :)
[23:33] <sylphie> IKline; what device is your raid array showing up as?
[23:33] <usr13> morfeo_81: Show us:  $PATH  |pastebinit
[23:34] <EpicCyndaquil> on Ubuntu server, I just chown'd a .pid file in /var/run/, yet this init.d script claims it does not have permissions to write the file. What gives?
[23:34] <trijntje> escott: "No boot device found"
[23:34] <escott> Ikline, thats a real server so you may have a real raid card. Do you know what kind of raid card it is
[23:34] <morfeo_81> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1547037/
[23:34] <usr13> morfeo_81: If it says "No such file or directory" at the end, that is normal.
[23:34] <jrib> EpicCyndaquil: give more context
[23:34] <morfeo_81> usr13: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1547037/
[23:35] <escott> trijntje, what is the output of "sudo parted -l" and can you mount the efi partition and run "tree" on that mountpoint
[23:35] <morfeo_81> usr13:not a valid identifier
[23:35] <morfeo_81> Download as text
[23:35] <dpurgert> morfeo_81, do there happen to be single quotes included in the path?
[23:35] <Ikline> No, i do not know what card it is
[23:35] <escott> Ikline, lscpi should tell you
[23:35] <usr13> morfeo_81: And that is after issuing command export $PATH ?  If so, that is normal.
[23:35] <morfeo_81> <dpurgert>:same result
[23:35] <usr13> morfeo_81: It is not an error.
[23:35] <Ikline> I'm not sure what device it shows up as, I'm currentyly on a live cd, and all I can remember how to do is open garted and look at the dev path
[23:36] <dpurgert> morfeo_81, WAAAAAAI
[23:36] <Ikline> ok, trying lscpi
[23:36] <morfeo_81> <dpurgert>: I use this "
[23:36] <usr13> morfeo_81: If all of those paths are correct, (and you want them there), it's ok.
[23:36] <dpurgert> morfeo_81, the first thing -- you have the weird tick at the beginning (the one above tilde) and a single quote at the end ...
[23:36] <dpurgert> s/above/below
[23:37] <Ikline> Ok, I may have been wrong, I only see a SATA controller, no mention of RAID, so it may in fact be software. So basically, now I'm really boned right?
[23:37] <escott> Ikline, this will tell you what the capabilities and kernel driver of the card is http://linuxmafia.com/faq/Hardware/sata.html
[23:37] <Ikline> This server was running fine until the power failure
[23:37] <morfeo_81> ok thanks everybody!!!

[23:38] <EpicCyndaquil> jrib: the init.d script is running as the user I chown'd the pid file to, what more context do I need to give?
=== czier_ is now known as czier
[23:38] <escott> Ikline, so there is some bit of intel firmware that together with dmraid (not mdadm) made it look like you had raid. you'll have to load that dmraid driver to get the dm device
[23:38] <Ikline> Hang on, there's some question in the IT department as to whether or not we ever actually RAIDed the system, I am going to check the machine physically, this makes me feel incredibly stupid
[23:39] <escott> trijntje, why is the efi system partition marked grub_bios. did you do that?
[23:39] <jrib> EpicCyndaquil: 1) why are you chowning anything at all?  2) what init script?  3) give full input and output you gave to get your error message
[23:39] <Ikline> Ok, here is the result: apparently we decided not to RAID, just to run regular back up. The hard drive is a solid state drive
[23:40] <EpicCyndaquil> jrib: init script for headphones, a music organizer
[23:40] <escott> trijntje, either you did that or the installer screwed up. in either case the efi partition is trashed you probably have to remake the fat partition on it, and then have both windows and ubuntu reinstall their efi bootloaders to that partition
[23:40] <Ikline> We havent had to touch this server in a very long time
[23:40] <trijntje> escott: the installer prompted me to select the efi partition
[23:40] <jrib> EpicCyndaquil: 1) why are you chowning anything at all?  2) where does the init script come from?  What is it's full path?  If you wrote it yourself, pastebin it.  3) give full input and output you gave to get your error message
[23:40] <jrib> its :/

[23:42] <dpurgert> jrib, Ikline had a power outage that killed his server for some reason or other ... seems to be hanging on init somewhere
[23:42] <sylphie> Ikline; the main drive is a ssd and you lost it during a power failure? Is so, the batter backup for the drive might have failed leaving you with no data?

[23:44] <usr13> Pip: If that's not it, it should be.  (IRC channels need a better sense of humor.)
[23:44] <trijntje> escott: any idea how I can get windows to restore the efi bootloader? Also, what is the proper way to install ubuntnu on an efi system once I get windows back?
[23:44] <Pip> okay
[23:44] <Ikline> jrib: yes, tried every previous kernel in the grub  list
[23:44] <dpurgert> because the DNS server you're asking about mx1.freebsd knows IPV6 (and/or freebsd is all IPV6)
[23:44] <Ikline> same message

[23:45] <escott> trijntje, no idea how you ask windows to reinstall its bootloader
[23:45] <Ikline> jrib: also tried fsck, but i dont know how to reference the LVM, so when I use /dev/sda5 (which is the partition I need) it tells me it cant find it, and i tried boot-repair, which freaked out and told me I needed RAID software

[23:46] <dpurgert> Ikline, try fdisk on /dev/sda then

[23:47] <dpurgert> wad ... should be apt-get autoremove (whatever the plugin is called) assuming you use apt
[23:47] <sylphie> xibalba; you actually can blacklist ipv6
[23:47] <dpurgert> xibalba, do you own the DNS server?
[23:47] <wad> dpurgert, okay.
[23:47] <Ikline> dpurgert: what command?
[23:47] <xibalba> dpurgert, I have a bind cache setup locally

[23:47] <xibalba> looks like ipv6 is enabeld on my bind box
[23:47] <morfeo_81> ok so that's it is incredible
[23:48] <dpurgert> xibalba, might need to config bind9 to stop with the IPV6
[23:48] <usr13> morfeo_81: What?
[23:48] <xibalba> dpurgert, yep doing that now
[23:48] <wad> dpurgert: I set it up a number of months ago. I'd like to change the version, and be able to try different versions. I think when I set it up, I made a symbolic link somewhere, but when I look places that google directs me to, it isn't there.
[23:48] <trijntje> escott: thanks for your help so far. Ill try to restore the efi partition tomorrow

[23:55] <Ikline> I have regular cron backups
[23:56] <sylphie> Ikline; is the problem fixed now?
[23:56] <Ikline> I'm not sure, I dont actually know if fsck did anything other than tell me that the volume is clean
[23:56] <Ikline> i used the -y option
[23:57] <usr13> Ikline: You've prolly got it.
[23:57] <sylphie> Ikline; see if it's fixed and bootable, I guess
[23:57] <Ikline> I'm going to try a reboot and see, thank you everyone, I might be backl in a ew minutes.
