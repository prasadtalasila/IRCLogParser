[09:35] <afournier> where can i find the latest mysql upstart script (online) ?
[09:49] <xnox> afournier: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?suite=raring&section=all&arch=any&keywords=mysql.conf&searchon=contents says it's in the mysql-server-5.5 package
[09:49] <afournier> thank a LOT !
[09:49] <xnox> afournier: pull-lp-source mysql-5.5 should give a you unpacked source package and it will be there somewhere
[09:49] <afournier> thanks*
[09:50] <afournier> i did not ubuntu got a search engine for package files, that will save me a lot of time, thanks again
[10:08] <xnox> afournier: yeah, it's handy. Can pick distributions you are interested in, and search source/binary/contents/etc.
[14:55] <afournier> i have a task (let's say network-interface.conf) that can be instanciated with several INTERFACE (lo, eth0, etc.) the pre-start script is run only once for all instances is it normal ?
[14:57] <jodh> afournier: no - pre-start will get run for each instance you start.
[14:57] <xnox> afournier: pre-start script is run once per instance.
[14:57] <afournier> :/
[14:57] <xnox> afournier: you can check "if not any existing instances running" do the "one-time initialisation"
[14:58] <xnox> afournier: but I'm not sure why would you want to. why are you using instances in this case?
[14:58] <afournier> indeed i want one pre-start for each instance
[14:58] <afournier> i dunno if i spotted a bug, or if my task is not correct
[14:59] <xnox> well that's what you get by default......
[14:59] <xnox> Just try simple job which for each instance it does "echo Starting instance $INSTANCE"
[14:59] <afournier> ok
[14:59] <xnox> and start a bunch of them and check the logs in /var/log/upstart/
[14:59] <xnox> and work your way up, to spot the bug =)
[15:04] <afournier> ok
[15:04]  * afournier is doing that
