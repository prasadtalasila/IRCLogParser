[16:49] <trijntje> Hi all. I'm thinking about writing a tv guide lens. Before I start, I want to make sure that a similar project does't already exist, so there's no duplicate effort
[16:52] <trijntje> I've been looking around on launchpad but it looks like there is no such thing, is that correct?
[16:59] <sirdancealot1> i wonder if theres any effort at all </troll
[17:00] <sirdancealot1> https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/community-r-tv-development http://www.doadjustyourset.com/2012/11/01/ubuntu-tv-uds-r-update/
[17:00] <sirdancealot1> two todos i found today
[17:09] <trijntje> sirdancealot1: thanks, it looks  there is some stuff for a tv program guide on the todo lists
[18:27] <mhall119> trijntje: tgm4883 is already working on a TV guide lens using MythTV as a backend
[18:31] <trijntje> mhall119: do you know where his code lives? I don't see anything about a TV guide on his launchpad https://code.launchpad.net/~tgm4883
[18:31] <mhall119> trijntje: nope, you'd have to ask him
[18:36] <trijntje> mhall119: thanks for the pointer, I'll shoot him an email
[20:01] <tgm4883> bobweaver, ping
[20:02] <tgm4883> trijntje, I've just got the scope portion written. I haven't started the lens portion yet
[20:03] <tgm4883> trijntje, bobweaver was going to make one for me, I'm unsure if he's started on it yet. You should at least talk with him on what new layout features are available
[20:38] <bobweaver> hey tgm4883
[20:43] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  it is kinda hard at this time due to some things that are going on internal with Ubuntu TV
[20:43]  * bobweaver is stuck between Rock and a Hard Place 
[20:43] <bobweaver> You know the Hurry up and wait game
[21:55] <bobweaver> hey tgm4883  I am not recording anything on myth tv atm but I can not change channels. what is up with that ? backend is up and says that there is nothing recording but yet I can only change 3 channels
[21:56] <bobweaver> Like I can switch for  10_1 to 10_2 and 10_3 but nothing at all that is like 8.1 or 32.1
[21:59] <bobweaver> Well that was crazy I tried to open up myth front end on backend and it says that all tuners are busy
[22:00] <bobweaver> I am rebooting backend to see if that helps
[22:03] <bobweaver> AllRight I got all my Channels back
[22:07] <trijntje> hi tgm4883 and bobweaver
[22:08] <bobweaver> Hello trijntje
[22:10] <trijntje> A little bit of background: I want to create a tv guide lens to ship with the localised dutch ubuntu images, so I'm not specifically involved with ubuntu TV
[22:10] <trijntje> I'm guessing that the same lens can be used on the TV and desktop interface?
[22:10] <bobweaver> with myth tv ?
[22:12] <bobweaver> trijntje,  it all depends on what you are using as a backend if I understand you righ t
[22:12] <bobweaver> so you want to make a iso that is only for the dutch and uses mythtv as backend to read lens ?
[22:14] <bobweaver> at any rate I do not want to be involved in anything carry's water in Nationalism. What can you tell me trijntje  that makes it not Nationalism ?
[22:15] <trijntje> bobweaver: I just want to create a 'normal' tv guide lens, ie for use on the desktop.
[22:15] <bobweaver> ahh
[22:15] <bobweaver> in unity 3d or 2d  ?
[22:15] <bobweaver> like you want the Rendering to look like a tvguide ?
[22:15] <trijntje> 3d I think, since 2d is no longer available on the latest releases of ubuntu
[22:16] <bobweaver> ok you will have to hack unity 3d then
[22:17] <bobweaver> adding things like TileHorizantial.cpp  but make that for guide and also need to make a way that Unity knows that that is the render type that you want to render
[22:17] <bobweaver> this can be dont in the lens its self
[22:17] <bobweaver> trijntje,  what kinda lens have you made in the past ?
[22:18] <trijntje> bobweaver: this would be my first lens. For now I'd be happy to get the functionality working in the default unity layout, without anything fance
[22:19] <trijntje> *fancy
[22:19] <trijntje> You were thinking something along these lines? http://askubuntu.com/questions/94490/what-is-the-api-for-new-lens-features-in-the-ubuntu-tv-alpha
[22:20] <bobweaver> No that is all fake
[22:20] <bobweaver> but Render type like that is possible
[22:20] <bobweaver> right now if you take a look at this kens
[22:20] <bobweaver> lens *
[22:20] <bobweaver> http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~davidc3/u2t/watchseries/view/head:/src/unity-lens-series
[22:20] <bobweaver> See line 37
[22:20] <bobweaver> and 40
[22:21] <bobweaver> so in 3d there is three render types
[22:21] <bobweaver> Coverflow
[22:21] <bobweaver> and the 2 that are in that example
[22:21] <bobweaver> but if you make a new rendering type then you can call tha t
[22:22] <bobweaver> I do not think that you can call coverflow though because they took it out of 3d because it is not ready
[22:25] <bobweaver> at anyrate if you want to just make a lens that works. Questions that I would ask myself is where am I getting my data from ? how do I want to render it to screen.  what is the effects that I want to put on it.  how can I take a data point and read from it in python so that dee knows what is going on ?
[22:25] <bobweaver> things like that
[22:26] <bobweaver> like if I am using mythtv I am going to query the backend If I am using youtube I am going to query youtube api
[22:26] <bobweaver> what Am I going to pass to unity as iconhint mimetype uri name
[22:27] <trijntje> bobweaver: yeah, first I should get more familiar with how lenses work. But if tgm4883 has the scope portion written I could just use that as backend and only write a simple lens right?
[22:27] <bobweaver> well that all depends on what it is that you are using
[22:27] <bobweaver> data source that is ^^
[22:27] <trijntje> or are those scopes using mythtv as backend? I'm not very familiar with mythTV, but that would probably make the lens rather big :P
[22:27] <bobweaver> if mythtv then yes you can use his api
[22:28] <bobweaver> It all depends on where you want to get your data from
[22:28]  * bobweaver knows nothing at all about dutch tv 
[22:29] <bobweaver> the picture from the link you posted is Unity 2d
[22:30] <bobweaver> it reads xml files that are hard coded at this point
[22:30] <bobweaver> the file is called Epg.qml it is under the dash in the ubuntu tv mockup code.  I took it out of my stuff for now
[22:31] <bobweaver> I use unity 2d with qml webview to just render a mythweb
[22:32] <trijntje> bobweaver: it looks like mythtv has a bunch of grabbers for Dutch television, so I guess I'll use one of those
[22:32] <trijntje> http://wiki.mythtv.nl/index.php/Grabbers
[22:33] <bobweaver> http://imagebin.org/242788
[22:34] <bobweaver> I just change from tv to desktop to tablet with this
[22:35] <bobweaver> http://imagebin.org/242789
[22:37] <trijntje> thats handy
[22:38] <bobweaver> yes it is
[22:38] <bobweaver> I can change any glib settings that there is from there

[22:40] <bobweaver> Sorry about the sound I do not have the money for a good mic
[22:40]  * bobweaver is super poor :) 
[22:41] <trijntje> Thanks for your time bobweaver, you've given me a lot to think about. I'll go read some more and try to get a simple lens to work, and I'll contact you or tgm when I've gotten started
[22:42] <bobweaver> Cool have fun with that
[22:42] <bobweaver> trijntje,  you may also look to people like davidcalle and mhall119  mhall119  knows alot about lens also
[22:43] <bobweaver> I think he wrote the guide on wiki.ubuntu.com but I could be wrong about tha t
[22:43] <bobweaver> that *
[22:43] <bobweaver> trijntje,  thanks for looking at my videos :) even though I am american :P
[22:44] <bobweaver> tgm4883,  how do I turn down vol in myth just the vol that the player is using
[22:44] <bobweaver> ?
[22:44] <trijntje> bobweaver: not everybody speaks English, so we can't all use the same system. Some of us need localised apps ;)
[22:45] <trijntje> See you later, have a nice evening!
[22:45] <bobweaver> that is why there is things like u2d.tr("text goes here to translate ")
[22:45] <bobweaver> but it was nice to meet you
