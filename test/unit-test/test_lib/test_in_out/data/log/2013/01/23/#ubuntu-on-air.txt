[19:19] <ProfTwitch> QUESTION. Can you tell us more about the new Scopes API?
[19:20] <FlyingPig> QUESTION: Are there plans for a CoreApps project for the desktop? It seems that GNOME and Unity are drifing apart more and more and Nautilus gets worse with each release.. (Would also be handy to have 1 source tree for all form factors..)
[19:21] <ikons> Question: when will canonical publicly acknowledge they messed up on the shopping lens and do something about it?
=== Dana is now known as Guest73118
[19:22] <ikons> Question: why doesnt Canonical give the trademark to the community and form a foundation so the community can have more input in the OS and direction?

[19:23] <ProfTwitch> QUESTION: Mark talked about applications having a 'phone face' and a 'desktop face'. Is there a plan for Ubuntu Phone Core Apps to be the phone face to the existing desktop apps, such as evince, gcalctool, etc.?
[19:23] <JoseeAntonioR> keep asking your questins, they'll be read on-air and answered!
[19:26] <rrnwexec> QUESTION: There's been a thread recently on the ubuntu-phone mailing list about partnering with  a "fair-trade" phone handset manufacturer. The idea would be to get Ubuntu deployed on a hardware platform that more closely matches Ubuntu's ethos. Any thoughts on pursuing this idea?
[19:26] <aeonwanderer> QUESTION: any clues about customization on ubuntu phone,
[19:27] <pemibo> QUESTION: Will we see more tutorials for Ubuntu Phone OS and Ubuntu Desktop in the future? I like the ones on developer.android.com or the video you did on developer.ubuntu.com (that little browser). Those helped me really a lot ;).
[19:30] <KevQuirk> Jono - I've heard rumours of Ubuntu going to a rolling release. Can you elaborate on this at all?
[19:30] <popey> KevQuirk: you missed it, he already covered that in detail

[19:31] <KevQuirk> thanks popey
[19:31] <ikons> Question: do you think Canonical has been critical of community members who has disagreed with the implementation? do you think contributors should be honest or toe the line? you said Alan Bells feedback was good but his ideas have not been used?
[19:32] <jamesh_> QUESTION: Is QML/JavaScript/C/C++ now the preferred way to develop for ubuntu desktop also?
[19:34] <ikons> Linux Foundation, Python Foundation, and many others do a fine job of protecting their trademarks
[19:37] <fruglepie> Engeneering is the only contribution worth counting?
[19:37] <popey> QUESTION: My son Sam knows you as "Daddys friend who *always* wears flip-flops" yet in recent photos you're not wearing them! This upsets Sam greatly and makes me look like a terrible father. Why aren't you wearing flip-flops?! :D
[19:38] <ikons_> Question: will Canonical at some point better recognize top community contributors and do more to support locos? it seems fedora better supports its communities with resources?
[19:40] <d0od> QUESTION: Recently some developers of apps in the 'ubuntu top 10 paid' chart have been mentioned their low sales. Are Canonical concerned with the current sales figures for apps? Or is it a case of getting people to use the Software Center more?
[19:40] <gregfmartin> popey - Demand he show his shoes on-air! :D
[19:41] <FlyingPig> QUESTION: Will I be able to use Ubuntu TV on my Ubuntu Desktop once it is finished?
[19:42] <popey> :D
[19:44] <ikons> Question: California loco says you go to loco events in your own state or even idle on the channel? doesnt seem supportive
[19:44] <ProfTwitch> QUESTION: We heard about an icon refresh a while ago and have now seen the new icons for scopes, the BFB, Ubuntu Software Centre, etc. Given you have hired a designer, can we expect to see many more new icons in Raring?
[19:45] <ikons> says you dont
[19:46] <ikons> jono: dont go to events ^
[19:46] <fruglepie> QUESTION: Is that periodic table complete?
[19:47] <popey> ikons: other canonical people do go to their local loco and lug, jono is just one guy
[19:47] <pemibo> QUESTION: Last year Mark Shuttleworth said that development will move more behind closed doors. Did he mean Ubuntu Phone OS with that or will we see some surprises on future desktop releases?
[19:48] <conscioususer_> QUESTION: Are there plans to hire full-time people to accelerate documentation work? Some Ubuntu-exclusive API docs are very lacking compared to, for example, GNOME docs, but usually the response about this is "volunteers welcome"
[19:49] <ProfTwitch> QUESTION: We heard about an icon refresh a while ago and have now seen the new icons for scopes, the BFB, Ubuntu Software Centre, etc. Given you have hired a designer, can we expect to see many more new icons in Raring?
[19:49] <ikons_> Question: so idling on a loco channel to support your local community is hard or makes your day longer?

[19:58] <rZr> QUESTION: Wont it be a good idea to setup a program for existing Meego/Symbian qml devs, we have apps to port to ubuntu ?
[19:58] <deshack> QUESTION: until now, Windows8 has had very few success and we know more and more manufacturers choose Linux. Do you think this is time for Ubuntu to have more success on desktop?
[19:58] <gregfmartin> Question: Is there currently a way to test Ubuntu Phone apps on existing hardware compatible with the Ubuntu Phone/Mobile ROM image? For example, running them on a Nexus 7. Sorry to steer convo back onto a technical track! :)
[19:58] <popey> ooh, was that the cloudy beer, yes, it's yummy
