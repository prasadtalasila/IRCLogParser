[00:39] <ESphynx> 'evening guys
[00:41] <ESphynx> micahg. xnox : you guys around?
[00:42] <ESphynx> How can I mark the bugs are raring=invalid quantal=confirmed ?
[00:43] <ESphynx> (I'm still puzzled as to why there's no attribute saying which release this affects on LP)
[01:04] <micahg> ESphynx: target to release
[01:05] <ESphynx> yeah how to I do that?
[01:07] <micahg> oh, right, you need to be in bug control to do that
[01:07] <micahg> where's the list again?
[01:07] <ESphynx> right =)
[01:07] <ESphynx> micahg: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecere-sdk/+bugs
[01:08] <ESphynx> if you have the time, could you review these quickly and let me know if they look fine or need more work? Before I assign ubuntu-sru
[01:08] <micahg> Bug #1097329 doesn't affect quantal I thought
[01:08] <ubottu> bug 1097329 in eclib (Ubuntu) "ecere-sdk: binary package conflict with eclib" [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1097329
[01:08] <ESphynx> micahg: right, all 14 others do though
[01:09] <ESphynx> first one that's marked HIGH is the Debian/Raring one
[01:09] <micahg> ah, right, that's raring
[01:10] <ESphynx> all the fixes are in bzr revisions
[01:14] <micahg> ESphynx: done
[01:14] <ESphynx> cool =) thanks
[01:14] <micahg> ESphynx: sure, thanks for working on this
[01:14] <ESphynx> Do you want to mark https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ecere-sdk/+bug/1097329 for raring as well?
[01:14] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1097329 in eclib (Ubuntu) "ecere-sdk: binary package conflict with eclib" [High,Confirmed]
[01:14] <ESphynx> micahg thank you!
[01:15] <micahg> ESphynx: done, and milestoned for feature freeze
[01:23] <ESphynx> micahgc: if what I've done looks decent, I'll start working on proper 64 bit support :P I wanted to get that done in January... took off from consulting to do so ;)
[01:23] <ESphynx> I want to make sure we have 64 bit support in 13.04 as well ;)
[01:26] <micahg> sounds good
[02:43] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, i'm (slowly) working on a composite php5-universe package that will incorporate the separate php5 modules that're in universe (that are separate from the php5 actual package), when its complete what should i do to upload it/get it in to Ubuntu?
[02:43] <TheLordOfTime> (its not even 10% complete, but this is me charting out what i'll have to do)
[02:57] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: file a bug explaining which sources it will replace and subscribe sponsors with a link to a .dsc somewhere
[02:57] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, .dsc within PPA acceptable at that point?
[02:58] <TheLordOfTime> i'm without a build box locally right now (hardware death), so PPAs are my build/test locations
[02:58] <TheLordOfTime> :/
[02:58] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: shouldn't it be as simple as copying the php5 source and removing/commenting out the packages/build options in main
[02:58] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: yes
[02:58] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, yes, except i have to figure out whether what's in universe actually builds from php5's source, or whether its from a smaller subset of the source :/
[02:58] <TheLordOfTime> (and some of the build options were already removed in main so i have to pull them from the universe packages)
[02:59]  * TheLordOfTime yawns
[02:59] <TheLordOfTime> all of which is on hold while my hard drive isn't working
[02:59] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: compare rmadison -S  -s raring php5 and rmadison -uqa php5 -S -s sid
[02:59] <TheLordOfTime> (packaging on liveusb == evil)
[03:01] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: you could compare the packages.ubuntu.com and packages.debian.org output as well
[03:02] <ajmitch> the packages in universe were subsets of the php5 source
[03:02] <micahg> I think that's all we'd want it to be in any case
[03:03] <ajmitch> of course they haven't been kept up to date nearly as well, but it was just a single directory per extension copied from the php5 package
[03:03] <ajmitch> a get-orig-source rule to automate that for new upstream releases might be a good idea, fwiw
[03:04] <micahg> I'd prefer it just be a full copy that's merged (the source can't be that much)
[03:05] <micahg> php5_5.4.11.orig.tar.xz 	9,197.6 kB
[03:05] <ajmitch> micahg: you mean duplicating the php5 source tarball & just building the extensions?
[03:05] <micahg> yep
[03:06] <micahg> the diff can just be applied to the new source
[03:06] <micahg> *packaging diff
[03:07] <ajmitch> it'd be slightly easier to keep in sync than a subset of the original source, but it's still a bit to duplicate
[03:07] <micahg> 10MB isn't much compared to other things :)
[03:07] <ajmitch> maybe I'm just biased by my internet connection that requires a hand-crank to upload each bit :)
[03:09] <micahg> ajmitch: why not get a webhost with a faster crank?
[03:09] <ajmitch> I'm waiting patiently for a 100/50 fibre connection
[03:09]  * micahg would like that :)
[03:10] <ajmitch> since I got the letter saying that the street will get it sometime in the next month
[03:10] <StevenK> ajmitch: UFB?
[03:11] <ajmitch> yep
[03:11] <StevenK> But it's NZ, so 100/50 to *what*? A sheep farm and a sheering shed?
[03:11] <ajmitch> 100/50 to the ISP, then 8 kbps from there
[03:12] <StevenK> Hahaha
[03:13] <ajmitch> StevenK: when are you getting a decent connection?
[03:14] <StevenK> This area is due for NBN sometime in 2015
[03:15] <ajmitch> better than waiting until 2020 or so

[10:16] <ESphynx> Why is Quantal so freaking slow in VirtualBox?
[10:21] <notgary> I've uploaded a debrief to this bug report (https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/autogen/+bug/1098872) and subscribed ubuntu sponsors. Is there anything else I need to do to get the patch merged?
[10:21] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1098872 in autogen (Ubuntu) "Update to 5.17.1" [Undecided,In progress]
[10:45] <ESphynx> I mean, it takes 2 whole seconds for the Unity thing to go on or off.
[10:46] <ESphynx> completing a switch from one window to the other takes a whole second
[11:19] <bobweaver> hello there I have a question about packaging I noticed this when I was looking through som stuff  http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~ehoover/netflix-desktop/trunk/view/head:/debian/changelog     what is @@DISTRO@@  ? is this a Var for distro version. Like it reads user ect. I want to use that branch in a recipe that I use But I only want it to build for 12.04 atm
[11:20] <maxb> bobweaver: It is merely a token that the package author is apparently going to use search and replace on before building an actual package
[11:20] <bobweaver> thanks maxb
[11:21] <maxb> Are you looking into the file conflict upgrading to 0.6.0 too? :-)
[11:22] <maxb> I've just sent ehoover an email about that
[11:22] <ESphynx> Why des the netflix video stream look so bad? it's supposed to be 1080p
[11:24] <maxb> As I understand it, it's only 1080p on selected content, which mostly doesn't seem to be anything I watch
[11:24] <bobweaver> ok SO this is what I want to do let me take a screenshot to explain (picture 1000 words ect )
[11:24] <ESphynx> maxb: we just tried to watch Knight & Day... after a good 20 minutes to figure out how to set it up on the PS3, we had the thing up
[11:25] <ESphynx> after 60 seconds I could not stand it , we watched a blu ray instead
[11:25] <maxb> Hm
[11:25] <bobweaver> http://imagebin.org/244654
[11:25] <ESphynx> On 109 inch projected screen on the wall compression artifacts look bad :P
[11:26] <bobweaver> I want to have that by default install with the packages that I am packaging up.
[11:26] <bobweaver> for my daily ppa and also my stable ppa. I want it to be uptodate with erics(netflixs desktop upstreamer)
[11:26] <maxb> Knight and Day - unavailable to stream - bah.
[11:27] <bobweaver> Which trunk is here https://code.launchpad.net/u2t
[11:27] <ESphynx> http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/Knight_and_Day/70127226?locale=en-US
[11:27] <ESphynx> "Available in HD on your TV"
[11:27] <ESphynx> Does HD stand for "Hyper Distorted"
[11:27] <bobweaver> so I was thinking of just making a recipe that builds from that branck to put in ppa but how to build recipe for branch that is not in my hosted area
[11:28] <bobweaver> I tried to import the branch to my "area" and it says that that is not allowed to import branchs like this
[11:30] <bobweaver> I just think that me checking out his branch everytime that it changes and then pusing back to mine is silly. I am sure that there might be a way around that even in the recipe
[11:30] <bobweaver> Like if I was to use the same recipe to build unity 2d and also netflix desktop how to tell the recipe to build 2 different packages ?
[11:34] <bobweaver> Nm it says that I have to ask launchpad if that is alright

[18:24] <micahg> ESphynx: quantal is slow in virtualbox since it's trying to do 3D acceleration, I'd suggest using gnome-fallback
[18:24] <micahg> Laney: re haskell, if we're pretty sure this is the version we want, let's go for it
[18:34] <TheLordOfTime> is cinnamon going to be supported in Ubuntu now, come raring?  https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cinnamon
[18:34] <TheLordOfTime> i know its technically not supported (nor technically compatible) with ubuntu in current releases, but...
[18:38] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: supported?  if it's in the archive, you can use it :)
[18:38] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, that's going to cause hell for #ubuntu come raring... is IRCC and the irc support ops team aware its in raring now?
[18:38] <micahg> what does it matter?
[18:38] <TheLordOfTime> because last i checked the stance in #ubuntu was "Cinnamon's not supported here"
[18:38] <micahg> it's like anything else, if you want it, you can install it
[18:39] <micahg> right, in raring it should get the same support as any other universe package
[18:43]  * TheLordOfTime shrugs
[19:24] <AlanBell> TheLordOfTime: sounds fine if it is being packaged for Ubuntu
[19:25] <AlanBell> probably gives us a better answer than we have at the moment for people who don't want to run the most supported desktop
[19:27] <TheLordOfTime> AlanBell, afaict its only in Raring so...
[19:27] <TheLordOfTime> probably a sync from Debian
[19:27] <AlanBell> yeah, so in #ubuntu+1 at the moment
[19:27] <TheLordOfTime> ... grrrr, stupid mysql workbench... micahg if i ask for a sync to raring of the latest mysql-workbench from experimental, do you think it'd be approved?
[19:28] <AlanBell> anyone know if we are enabling broadway backend in gtk yet?
[19:31] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: if it builds, sure
[19:32] <agrestringere> Hello, just wanted to report a pretty serious bug, can anyone help me resolve?
[19:33] <AlanBell> what is the bug number agrestringere?
[19:33] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, i'll upload a test build for raring to my build tests PPA, and get back to you

[19:33] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1109207 in eglibc (Ubuntu) "Unpacking replacement libc6-dev ... dpkg-deb (subprocess): data: internal gzip read error: '<fd:4>: data error'" [Undecided,New]
[19:34] <agrestringere> It's libc6 related so it seems pretty serious...
[19:37] <AlanBell> agrestringere: maybe check the md5sum against this http://packages.ubuntu.com/precise/amd64/libc6-dev/download
[19:38] <agrestringere> AlanBell: how do I do that?
[19:38] <AlanBell> I don't really know what the problem is, however I will note that this is just the dev package, not libc6 itself
[19:38] <jbicha> AlanBell: it looks like we're currently only building the x11 and wayland backends
[19:38] <AlanBell> agrestringere: md5sum /var/cache/apt/archives/libc6-dev_2.15-0ubuntu10.4_amd64.deb

[19:40] <agrestringere> AlanBell I get d4b381ca574343f0ec688cfdca50c43e when it should be 272a87775b2f05e18cfef62d939b4306
[19:41] <jbicha> AlanBell: I'm guessing we're waiting on someone to test it and make sure that enabling it doesn't break anything
[19:42] <AlanBell> agrestringere: well that sounds like a dodgy download then, that d4b381ca574343f0ec688cfdca50c43e is not known to google
[19:43] <agrestringere> AlanBell: got two values for md5sum is that normal?
[19:43] <AlanBell> two values??
[19:43] <agrestringere> First: d4b381ca574343f0ec688cfdca50c43e Second: 272a87775b2f05e18cfef62d939b4306
[19:44] <agrestringere> Made a mistake with the Second: 9b625ca82f5b48069f869c7d66857823
[19:45] <agrestringere> I'm using the Columbia University mirror, should I switch Mirrors?
[19:45] <agrestringere> Lastly, can I clear out my apt-cache and rebuild it, switch mirrors and try again?
[19:45] <AlanBell> I don't know about that. If it were me I would download a good copy of the file, check the MD5sum, take a back up of the bad one, and swap over a good copy
[19:46] <Unit193> jbicha: I've had it enabled for a little while, while I haven't used the broadway backend, I haven't had more issues than normal.
[19:47] <AlanBell> so what is involved in enabling it? I have to rebuild the gtk+ package?
[19:47] <AlanBell> sounds like something to stick in a PPA
[19:47] <AlanBell> oh, as luck would have it someone already has
[19:48] <Unit193> Like launchpad.net/~malizor/+archive/gtk-broadway
[19:48] <micahg> TheLordOfTime: over 1 month
=== glebihan_ is now known as glebihan
[19:50] <agrestringere> AlanBell, from what I can see I think the package is broken
[19:51] <AlanBell> agrestringere: yeah, I think your download of it is corrupt. I don't really know what to do about it with any confidence though :)
[19:51] <jbicha> AlanBell: just add --enable-broadway-backend to debian/rules
[19:54] <AlanBell> I might give that a go later
[19:56] <jbicha> and then if it works, bug Laney or someone to turn it on by default :)
[19:57] <Laney> does it do anything useful?
[20:00] <agrestringere> AlanBell: it's happening even with the non-corrupted copy
[20:01] <AlanBell> Laney: I will let you know, I think I might have a use for it
[20:01] <agrestringere> AlanBell, look at this comment https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/+bug/1109207/comments/3

[23:29] <TheLordOfTime> micahg, thanks (I got my second time of asking feature freeze date answered in +1)
[23:34] <ScottK> Reading the schedule would be another way to find that out.
[23:35] <TheLordOfTime> ScottK, was on mobile at the time.
[23:35] <ScottK> Does the mobile not have a web browser?
[23:35] <TheLordOfTime> (opening web would've killed irc)
[23:35] <TheLordOfTime> ScottK, old enough to not have multi-app capacity
[23:36] <ScottK> Sounds like a poor choice in operating systems.
[23:36] <TheLordOfTime> sounds like a 7 year old devicie to me :/
[23:36] <TheLordOfTime> regardless... :P
[23:36] <ScottK> For 2005/06, I'll give you that.
