[00:15] <bkerensa> cprofitt:  what do you think about LoCo's selling advertising on their sites? Seems pretty commercialized 
[09:31] <YoBoY> good morning
[09:35] <YoBoY> Do I have to open a bug to suggest a branding change of the locoteams launchpad team (https://launchpad.net/~locoteams)?
[09:35] <YoBoY> !lococouncil
[09:35] <ubot2> The Loco Council is huats, czajkowski, itnet7, SergioMeneses, coolbhavi, and effiejayx - they are there to help, just ask! :) You can send them an email at loco-council@lists.ubuntu.com
[09:37] <czajkowski> YoBoY: have you got a new logo done up for us :)
[09:37] <czajkowski> if so I'll change it 
[09:39] <YoBoY> sorry, no ^^" I can try something, but I need a direction. The ubuntu cof with locoteams writing on the mugshot and logo, or the comunity picto ?
[09:39] <czajkowski> conf? picto?
[09:40] <YoBoY> cof = circle of friends, picto = pictogram (icons used everywhere in the new branding)
[09:41] <czajkowski> maybe ask on the loco contacts list
[09:41] <czajkowski> or we can ask the design team if they had someone to do something for us 
[09:41] <czajkowski> it's just never come up 
[09:41] <czajkowski> it's just a logo on LP 
[09:46] <YoBoY> an example http://ubuntuone.com/1ZOTyknexCkJyeCtb4AU1C
[09:46] <YoBoY> I'll send a mail on the contacts list
[09:48] <czajkowski> cool
[09:48] <czajkowski> :)
[10:12] <YoBoY> mail sent
[10:18] <czajkowski> excelent
=== huats_ is now known as huats
[16:45] <pleia2> YoBoY: perhaps email the ubuntu-art@lists.ubuntu.com list too? they're always looking for thins to do
[16:45] <pleia2> (probably need to subscribe to email)
[17:18] <YoBoY> pleia2, I sent it, thank you for the suggestion
