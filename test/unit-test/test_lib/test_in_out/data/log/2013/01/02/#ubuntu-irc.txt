=== Celene is now known as Celene_away
[07:29] <Noskcaj> i think ubottu needs an update
[07:30] <Noskcaj> !xubuntu
[07:30] <ubottu> Xubuntu is Ubuntu with Xfce instead of !GNOME. More info at http://www.xubuntu.org and http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/ - To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop » - Join #xubuntu for support - See also: !Ubuntu and !Xubuntu-Channels
[07:30] <Noskcaj> note the "gnome"
[07:32] <Myrtti> which part of that is in need of update?
[07:32] <Myrtti> it's still accurate by my reading it
[07:33] <Noskcaj> Myrtti, unit yis now ubuntu's desktop
[07:33] <Myrtti> no, it's Gnome with Unity as the shell
[07:34] <Noskcaj> then maybe i'm wrong, it should be !unity though. especially since gnubuntu is coming soon
[07:34] <Myrtti> that would imply then that xfce is a unity replacement, which it's not
[07:35] <Noskcaj> Myrtti, true. but gnubuntu?
[07:36] <IdleOne> when it gets here we can burn down that bridge
[07:36] <Noskcaj> IdleOne, lol.
[07:36] <Myrtti> if that's some sort of Gnome respin, then a) I doubt it's an official derivative, and b) it would be unwise to reuse the name of the GNU Ubuntu project
[07:36] <Myrtti> and c) what does that have to do with the xubuntu factoid
[07:37] <Noskcaj> i think thats what they call it, i'm not sure
[07:37] <Noskcaj> the !gnome bit
[07:37] <Myrtti> see point a)
[07:38] <Noskcaj> Myrtti, coming in the next year i beleive. also, when i type !gnome, look what appears
[07:38] <Noskcaj> !gnome
[07:38] <ubottu> GNOME is the default !desktop environment on Ubuntu up to 10.10 To install it from Kubuntu or Xubuntu, type « sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop » in a !terminal.
[07:38] <Noskcaj> not the "up to
[07:39] <Noskcaj> *notw
[07:39] <Noskcaj> **note
[07:40] <IdleOne> what's wrong with it?
[07:40] <Noskcaj> it implies it's gone
[07:41] <IdleOne> how so?
[07:42] <IdleOne> To me it implies that there are more versions after 10.10
[07:42] <Noskcaj> nevermind, i give up
[07:43] <IdleOne> Noskcaj: suggest an edit. pointing out what you see as a mistake and then not giving the correct answer is not helpful. I can't read your mind, I don't know what you are thinking.
[07:43] <Noskcaj> IdleOne, i tryed to explain
[07:54] <Noskcaj> its called gubuntu i think
[14:36] <hggdh> indeed. We are running 12.10 now. A message that says "up to 10.10" also implies it is not this way nowadays
[15:25] <AlanBell> it isn't
[15:26] <AlanBell> Unity is the default nowadays (and yes, I kind of know the difference between a shell and a DE)
=== JanC_ is now known as JanC
=== Celene_away is now known as ClumsyFairyQueen
[18:21] <hggdh> this is the point. We now run Gnome with the Unity shell, as the poster pointed out. This confuses people, since most do not know the difference betweem the shell and the underlying arch
=== guampa_ is now known as guampa
