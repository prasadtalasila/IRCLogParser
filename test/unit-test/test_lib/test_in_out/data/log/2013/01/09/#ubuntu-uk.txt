[01:45] <shingdayho> hey guys
[01:45] <shingdayho> my wireless im getting high latency every few pings when pinging my default gateway
[01:46] <shingdayho> before i was using win 7 on this PC and never got latency issue and nor on any other PC
[01:46] <shingdayho> any idea what it may be (obv wireless driver or something) and how to fix it?

[08:21] <Knightwise> hey everyone ! :)
[08:21] <Knightwise> czajkowski: are you awake yet ?
[08:22] <czajkowski> yup
[08:23] <Knightwise> czajkowski: i tried sending Jono a message on facebook yesterday, but perhaps you could help me
[08:24] <Knightwise> we would like to send a camera crew to fossdem this year and see if it would be possible to do an item on the new ubuntu phone os
[08:25] <Knightwise> in short we would like to know IF there are any demo models of the ubuntu phone going to be at Fossdemm and who we need to talk to to set up a 30 minute interview.
[08:25] <czajkowski> Knightwise: fosdem isn't really like that kinda event :)
[08:25] <czajkowski> and canonical folks tend to be developers at it the booth is a community booth also.
[08:25] <czajkowski> I can ask and see if we know of any phone devs going if that helps
[08:26] <Knightwise> yeah I know , but since Ubuntu has a booth there i was thinking it might possible.
[08:26] <Knightwise> would be the only time we could get our hands on a working demo
[08:26] <czajkowski> the booths/stands are community run stands and canonical tend to not be at them tbh
[08:26] <Knightwise> czajkowski:that would be awesome.
[08:27] <brobostigon> good morning everyone.
[08:28] <popey> Knightwise: unlikely there will be anyone with the phone OS officially there
[08:28] <Knightwise> hey brobostigon
[08:28] <popey> we're sending a few people, not not those developers, they're busy ☺
[08:29] <brobostigon> hey Knightwise
[08:29] <Knightwise> popey: any chance they might take a demo model with them ?
[08:29] <popey> almost certainly not
[08:29] <Knightwise> popey: ps we are airing the episode with alex chiang today.
[08:29] <Knightwise> popey:  :( too bad. It was worth a try to ask.
[08:30] <czajkowski> ah don't need to poke popey has the know :)
[08:33] <Knightwise> would there be any other entrypoint into canonical that might help us take a peek at one of the demo models ?
[08:34] <Knightwise> (sorry to bug you guys with this, but it would be great for the show)
[08:34] <Knightwise> and you are the only canonicilians i know.
[08:35] <popey> go to barcelona 25-28 feb
[08:35] <popey> http://www.mobileworldcongress.com/
[08:35] <popey> or wait for the image / source to be released and play with that
[08:38] <Knightwise> Wish I could go to Barcelona :(
[08:38] <brobostigon> cool. google now, is showing birthdays of people from g+.
[08:40] <diplo> Morning all
[08:43] <Azelphur> morning
[08:43] <Azelphur> I've been listening to ode to fire alarm since half 4 :)
[08:57] <daubers> Morning
[09:16] <MooDoo> morning all
[09:19] <Laney> meow
[09:19] <mungbean> woof
[09:20]  * Laney runs up a tree
[09:21] <Knightwise> hey MooDoo Laney
[09:23]  * czajkowski bottles some of Laney energry and sells it 
[09:26] <SuperMatt> morning
[09:28] <popey> must see! new episode of linux outlaws is out! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JmA2ClUvUY
[09:31] <SuperMatt> http://www.supermatt.net/surprisingly-sage-advice-from-pwqgen/ <- this is a must see!
[09:33] <AlanBell> popey: harsh, but fair
[09:39] <mungbean> anyone have a carbon monoxide alarm?
[09:40] <SuperMatt> nope
[09:41] <mungbean> wonder whether siting it upstairs (boiler in kitchen) is sufficien
[09:42] <SuperMatt> probably not
[09:42]  * mungbean waits for consensus
[09:42] <dwatkins> mungbean: it should be next to the boiler. I had one of those passive ones which changes colour stuck to my boiler.
[09:42] <AlanBell> isn't it heavier than air?
[09:43] <AlanBell> maybe not http://www.homesafe.com/coalert/index.php
[09:46] <mungbean> its a CO alarm
[09:46] <mungbean> combined smoke and CO
[09:47] <mungbean> Homeowners should remember not to install carbon monoxide detectors directly above or beside fuel-burning appliances, as appliances may emit a small amount of carbon monoxide upon start-up. A detector should not be placed within fifteen feet of heating or cooking appliances or in or near very humid areas such as bathrooms.
[09:47] <mungbean>  located near the sleeping area, where it can wake you if you are asleep
[09:48] <mungbean> thanks for link AlanBell
[09:53] <dwatkins> http://www.amazon.co.uk/Carbon-Monoxide-CO-Detector-Monitor/dp/B005K7RVRI/r is what I had, I should probabyl get an actual alarm for my new boiler.

[10:46] <xnox> I love todays doodle
[10:47] <SuperMatt> yarr, it's good
[10:47] <SuperMatt> I can't believe the system I rely on every day is 150 years old
[10:54] <SuperMatt> http://design.canonical.com/wp-content/uploads/ubuntu-award-s.jpg <- god, I love Jono's stance
[10:55] <SuperMatt> he's really rocking the superhero look

[10:56] <dwatkins> SuperMatt: the tube?
[10:56] <dwatkins> I gather the London Underground is 150 years young today
[11:12] <SuperMatt> dwatkins: yuppers!
[11:14] <SuperMatt> it certainly creaks like a 150 year old
[11:22]  * dwatkins notes he shares his birthday with the London Underground
[11:24] <mungbean> is there something like shutter but for windows7?
[11:24] <davmor2> Morning all
[11:25] <SuperMatt> mungbean: greenshot
[11:25] <mungbean> thanks SuperMatt
[11:25] <SuperMatt> I don't know if they're comparable, but it's a screenshot program
[11:25] <mungbean> jsut want something to popup rather than run pbrush
[11:26] <mungbean> i see win7 has a tool called snippet too
[11:26] <SuperMatt> well, I don't know what that does
[11:27] <ali1234> it's a screenshot tool
[11:27] <mungbean> but it doesn't run in the background
[11:27] <ali1234> why would you want it to?
[11:28] <ali1234> you can pin it to the taskbar. it has right click functions
[11:28] <SuperMatt> that's not so bad
[11:28] <davmor2> mungbean: you can just do PrtScn open paint copy it in save it as png done if you don't want to go through the hassle of installing stuff
[11:33] <mungbean> :-|
[11:33] <mungbean> i'd want it to do what shutter does
[11:33] <SuperMatt> that snipping tool looks ok
[11:34] <SuperMatt> one thing I like about shutter is being able to recapture an area, so if you're trying to screenshot a webpage multiple times for a document, it's nice and easy
[11:50] <Azelphur> second ikea delivery, got some more legs, now for the third delivery
[11:51] <Azelphur> I dream of a day when ikea sends all the required components to build my desk
[11:51] <dwatkins> I've been considering getting a new desk from Ikea, but I need one that's 2m wide, which one are you getting, Azelphur?
[11:51] <Azelphur> dwatkins: I got galants and just stick them all together
[11:51] <dwatkins> cunning
[11:52] <Azelphur> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/misc/2012/December/layout.png is my plan
[11:52] <dwatkins> They have one that's a single piece of wood 2m wide, but it's only about 30cm deep
[11:52] <dwatkins> very nice, and you don't have any pesky legs in the way of where you'll be sitting
[11:52] <Azelphur> indeed
[11:52] <diplo> I've just bought a plain desk from Ikdea for the boys
[11:52] <diplo> -d
[11:53] <Azelphur> well, at the moment, I don't have any legs at all ;)
[11:53] <dwatkins> I have an alcove that's within a very small distance of 2m, so I might need to get something just under 2m wide.
[11:53] <mungbean> does anyone know of a storage box that fits nicely under ektorp sofa?
[11:53] <Azelphur> dwatkins: if you got a 160 with a 30cm extension it'd come to 190
[11:53] <dwatkins> aha nice
[11:54] <diplo> http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S19903730/
[11:54] <Azelphur> or a 120 with 2 30cm extensions would probably look nicer
[11:54] <Azelphur> but yea, stick galant into ikea.com, there seem to be lots of choices
[11:55] <davmor2> Azelphur: with those I recommend you get the cable tidies too they are only a few quid but it save you kicking cables
[11:56] <Azelphur> I didn't bother with the cable tidies, my desk is so deep I doubt it'll be an issue
[11:56] <dwatkins> I have a 9-way mains thing under my desk at work, I'd like to get one for home and attach it to the back of my desk.
[11:56] <Azelphur> I've got 1.4m deep lol
[11:57] <davmor2> Azelphur: ah sorry it was diplo
[11:57] <diplo> :D
[12:00] <Azelphur> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3832397/screenshots/2012/December/2013-01-09-115809_785x584_scrot.png this bug amuses me
[12:01] <shauno> someone needs to be slapped for that blue background.  especially with the logo/mugshot on white.
[12:02] <Azelphur> hehe indeed, poor design
[12:02] <SuperMatt> they probably bought an off the shelf product and smooshed it in with the least possible effort
[12:02] <Azelphur> our friendly ikea.op4 says he will courier out the rest of my legs in 3-5 days, yay.
[12:02] <Azelphur> in theory they can't send too few legs this time, since only 4 remain
[12:03] <Azelphur> 2*
[12:04] <shauno> "in theory" you may have just cursed yourself.  be prepared to receive one leg for a completely different product, and two left feet for dramatic effect :)
[12:04] <Azelphur> rofl indeed
[12:04] <Azelphur> I ordered 4 desks which should have a total of 20 legs, they sent me 10, realised they screwed up and couriered me another 8, so I just opened that ikea chat to say "what about the other 2?" XD
[12:10] <shauno> if it was anyone else, I'd be pondering why on earth you need 4 desks.  but it's you
[12:13] <shauno> surprised you didn't opt for lack racks instead though
[12:21] <xnox> this looks nice as well: http://www.ikea.com/gb/en/catalog/products/S99908776/
[12:21] <xnox> I might get one.
[12:22] <SuperMatt> ooh, a wide desk, I could do with one of those
[12:22] <SuperMatt> stick two monitors on it, and my tower and sub underneath
[12:23]  * xnox has two monitors already, but I use it with a laptop, thinking to get a desktop tower though.
[12:24] <shauno> I got my desk from a commercial clearout.  makes my home office look like a cube-farm, but so much more space than they usually give you for domestic
[12:26] <mungbean> where do i find terminal server connection logs in windows 2k8 server please?
[12:27]  * Laney got a nice big glass desk from an office furniture shop
[12:30] <xnox> sounds nice Laney, but I don't like scratches and smudges on the glass desks, as I tend to put hard-drives on my desk and things like that.
[12:32] <Laney> it's mildly annoying that i can see the cable mess
[12:32] <Laney> but not annoying enough that i can be bothered to tidy it up apparently
[12:46] <Azelphur> are there any laws surrounding ridiculous fire alarms?
[12:46] <Azelphur> in the my flat has a fire alarm that I have no control over, it went off from 4:30 till 10:30am today, landlord didn't answer 24 hour emergency line all day till 10 when he finally came out
[12:47] <Azelphur> annnnd, now it's going again
[12:48] <mungbean> yes, Azelphur
[12:48] <Azelphur> what's the law on that?
[12:48] <mungbean> noise abatement section of the council
[12:48] <Azelphur> cool
[12:49] <Azelphur> :D
[12:50] <mungbean> We can deal with 'statutory nuisance' that comes under the following categories:
[12:50] <mungbean> Noise from a premises
[12:50] <mungbean> Noise emitted from a vehicle, machinery or equipment in the street
[12:50] <mungbean> including alarms
[12:50] <Azelphur> fun
[12:50] <Azelphur> this is round 3 of the fire alarm, it was going nuts on new years eve too for a few hours
[12:54] <JohnRobert> hello
[13:07] <davmor2> bigcalm: what do you want to do about Thursday, Alex can't make it he has a day of conf calls, mat is in Ireland by the sound of it and no news from gord :)
[13:30] <davmor2> czajkowski: ping
[13:31] <davmor2> if czajkowski responds before the end of Lunch every pick on her, it's for her own good :)
[13:34] <dwatkins> what for, davmor2?
[13:58] <czajkowski> davmor2: ello :)
[14:01] <Azelphur> looks like MS is killing Windows Live Messenger
[14:01] <Azelphur> it's skype or GTFO as of March 15
[14:02] <Azelphur> abandon ship folks.
[14:02] <dwatkins> I barely use Skype as it is.
[14:02] <bigcalm> davmor2: ug. See how I feel after the LUG meeting tonight :)
[14:02] <dwatkins> I'd like to see a SIP service that competes.
[14:02] <Azelphur> me too
[14:02] <solarcloud_3scrn> I use skype all the time .. saves £100's a year.
[14:02] <Azelphur> I dunno why someone doesn't make a neat SIP client
[14:02] <Azelphur> people on same SIP network are just a username
[14:02] <Azelphur> but you can dial out to other networks too
[14:03] <Azelphur> job done, that'd make it awesome
[14:08] <Azelphur> dwatkins: speak of the devil, http://www.pcworld.com/article/2018815/ekiga-4-0-offers-a-fresh-open-source-skype-alternative.html
[14:08] <Azelphur> o.O
[14:10] <dwatkins> ooh nice
[14:21] <mungbean> anything i can check on a windows server that was compromised?
[14:21] <dwatkins> How does Ekiga do the match-making between users? Do they have a server you log on to?
[14:21] <mungbean> it doesn't have net access anymroe to downlouad a rootkit checker
[14:21] <dwatkins> mungbean: if a server has been compromised, I'd consider wiping it and reinstalling, or just getting a security expert in
[14:23] <AlanBell> who will wipe it and reinstall it
[14:24] <dwatkins> AlanBell: perhaps, but they might also take into consideration the rest of the network and what else might have happened
[14:24] <mungbean> yes, i'm looking at a clone of the vm
[14:24] <mungbean> event logs were wiped by the kiddie
[14:25] <mungbean> just interested at the level of tinkering they've done
[14:25] <dwatkins> what does it serve, I'm curious
[14:25] <mungbean> it's impossible afaik to determine if they initiated further rdesktop connections
[14:25] <dwatkins> yeah, unless you have detailled network access logs
[14:25] <mungbean> only rejects
[14:25] <dwatkins> if you're lucky there might be some kind of history in the rdesktop client, but I doubt it
[14:26] <mungbean> i'll try that
[14:26] <mungbean> could have been colleagues tho
[14:26] <dwatkins> they might also have downloaded their own standalone client of any kind
[14:26] <dwatkins> I hope the machine is on a DMZ
[14:29] <mungbean> no comment
[14:29] <dwatkins> :(
[14:29] <mungbean> nothing to do with me
[14:30] <dwatkins> A team that I work with recently had a machine compromised by an SQL injection attack.
[14:30] <mungbean> ruby on rails?
[14:30] <dwatkins> I don't know what the server runs, it's a website with a forum, that's all I know.
[14:30] <mungbean> phpbb was designed to be hacked
[14:31] <dwatkins> it was?
[14:32] <mungbean> not officially
[14:32] <mungbean> but its a running battle to keep un to date with the security alerts. and what if the alert is released while you're asleep
[14:32] <mungbean> bosh
[14:33] <dwatkins> yeah, I have a wordpress blog, it handles it well
[14:45] <brobostigon> question, can i connect rpi model-b, directly from composite output into an earial input on my tv ?
[14:45] <AlanBell> no
[14:45] <brobostigon> ok.
[14:45] <AlanBell> composite in, a yellow coax
[14:46] <AlanBell> audio red/black lead will do fine
[14:46] <daubers> AlanBell: Composite shouldn't be coax.....
[14:47] <brobostigon> AlanBell: i have yllow on rpi end, so that needs to be yellow on tv end ?
[14:47] <daubers> brobostigon: Yes
[14:47] <dwatkins> Composite can be used with AV inputs, e.g. SCART or a similar yellow video input connector, not with an aerial in (unless you have a converter)
[14:47] <AlanBell> daubers: quite right, not coax
[14:47] <brobostigon> daubers: ok, let me try again.
[14:47] <dwatkins> you can get BNC converters, but they need to be the right impedence, most TVs have a yellow composite in
[14:48] <brobostigon> ok, thank you dwatkins
[14:48] <dwatkins> welcome
[14:48] <dwatkins> you can also get HDMI -> DVI cables, Amazon have a cheap 'basic' one
[14:48] <popey> does the pi do audio over hdmi?
[14:49] <dwatkins> popey: yes, although it also has a 3.5mm jack, so you choose in software which to use
[14:50] <brobostigon> will it show up, as on of the av channels on the tv end?
[14:51] <popey> should do or wont be much point having the port ☺
[14:51] <dwatkins> My TV doesn't detect whether or not there's anything plugged in to the SCART or AV inputs, but with HDMI it can tell if a device is switched on or not.
[14:51] <brobostigon> popey: ok.
[14:51] <dwatkins> oh right, yeah, AV
[14:52] <dwatkins> what kind of cable are you using, brobostigon?
[14:57] <JohnRobert> can you actually get pi's delivered fairly quick now?
[14:58] <brobostigon> dwatkins: i am using, from what i can see, a normal composite cable.
[14:58] <kvarley> JohnRobert: Yeah, within a week
[15:00] <mungbean> what present should i buy my borther in law who did me a big favour? he already hs a rpi
[15:02] <mungbean> http://www.w2comp.com/detail.asp?catid=74585&Pdtid=663086 is looking good
[15:02] <dwatkins> brobostigon: ah ok cool
[15:04] <brobostigon> dwatkins: although, i think, the body of the connector is too big, and it bangs up against the tv's casing.
[15:04] <dwatkins> shame the spec of cables doesn't include this sort of information
[15:04] <dwatkins> I'm forever having issues with headphones like that
[15:05] <brobostigon> that might be the issue.
[15:30] <NET||abuse> hi folks, got a question on mtp. trying to get my head around using it in a sane way, is there one?
[15:30] <NET||abuse> the latency on mtp-connect just seems completely unworkable.
[15:31] <NET||abuse> gmtp is just hanging forever
[15:31] <NET||abuse> i have gmtp sometimes working, with patients between commads]#
[15:34] <directhex> mtp *does* come with a bunch of latency. whish is why you're meant to open a connection and hold it open, caching the state of the target device
[15:34] <NET||abuse> well, can't find a discussion on how to use it more effectively? other than messing with mtpfs and fstab
[15:34] <NET||abuse> i'm happy to use something like gmtp
[15:35] <NET||abuse> but every single action is just sooo slow.
[15:36] <NET||abuse> i tried running mtp-connect --sendifle somefile.avi [folder_id]  and it just errors out
[15:36] <NET||abuse> so command line doesn't seem any more useful.
[15:37] <NET||abuse> anyway, just kind of frustrating that working with andoid and linux is so hard, android is meant to be OUR thing!
[15:49] <mungbean> if telnet isn't on my box how can i use netcat to check a port is open?
[15:49] <mungbean> nc 1.2.3.4 22 isn't working
[15:51] <NET||abuse> netstat -tap
[15:52] <NET||abuse> oh, check a remote box?
[15:52] <NET||abuse> nmap -sP 1.2.3.0/24 :) scan the whole subnet
[15:53] <dwatkins> mungbean: you need to listen on the server first: nc -l 12345
[15:53] <mungbean> then you earn the name of net abuse
[15:53] <NET||abuse> :)
[15:53] <dwatkins> on the client, you then connect via hostname or IP address: nc 192.168.1.3 12345
[15:54] <shauno> heh, I actually use -sP /24 far, far too often
[15:54] <dwatkins> ports under 1024 require root
[15:54] <NET||abuse> :P
[15:54] <NET||abuse> dashsP should be a nick
[15:55] <mungbean> yeah, doesn't work, i don't have root on this box to check iptablse
[15:55] <NET||abuse> meh, i'll never use it :)
[15:57] <dwatkins> netstat -rn
[15:57] <dwatkins> that'll show the IP routing table for a non-root user
[15:57] <dwatkins> oh you mean the firewall, sorry, ignore me
[15:58] <mungbean> i needed -v on my command since 3389 doesn't talk back
[15:58] <mungbean> on my nc command
[16:01] <d3ngar> Hi there
[16:01] <d3ngar> I have a problem with SSH. I'm trying to automatically connect to another server via key, but I keep getting asked the key passphrase
[16:02] <d3ngar> I read that I can disable that by editing the ssh_config file and switching the batchmode to yes
[16:02] <d3ngar> But when I do that, SSH won't connect
[16:06] <SuperMatt> your SSH key has a passphrase on it, you will have to remove the passphrase if you want your connection to be frictionless
[16:06] <SuperMatt> with ssh-keygen -p
[16:07] <SuperMatt> the key passphrase is used to unencrypt the private key, so nothing else you do will help
[16:08] <d3ngar> Really?
[16:08] <d3ngar> Well, that sorta makes sense
[16:08] <d3ngar> But is disappointing
[16:08] <d3ngar> Thanks SuperMatt
[16:08] <SuperMatt> you're welcome
[16:09] <SuperMatt> if you're in a gui, you can use the password manager to save the password, but it will not work for tty
[16:09] <d3ngar> That's alright then
[16:09] <d3ngar> I'm thinking about it
[16:09] <d3ngar> I could still use an expect script to automate this and provider the passphrase automatically, no?
[16:09] <SuperMatt> essentially, if you want an automatic job, you're going to have to remove the passphrase
[16:10] <SuperMatt> you can, but then your passphrase is in plaintext somewhere
[16:10] <SuperMatt> which is just as useless as not having the passphrase
[16:11] <SuperMatt> it's a level of complexity you really don't need
[16:12] <d3ngar> Alright
[16:12] <d3ngar> Thanks!
[16:29] <dwatkins> isn't there a passphrase manager for the command line that works on a per-session basis?
