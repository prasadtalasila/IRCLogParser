[10:09] <rye> sil2100: while I somehow got your attention - I've been trying to find the reason of https://bugs.launchpad.net/ayatana-design/+bug/723167 - and it looks like cairo is not happy about creating antialiased areas on a totally transparent surface. The same was happening in unity-2d and the fact that we have a nice antialiased text in Ambiance looks like pure luck.

[10:11] <rperier> sil2100: Hi, I've a question: where is the component/module which handles shortcuts for starting the dash ? (with "Super"). In fact, I found a bug when you switch from commands.lens to the dash

[10:52]  * rye fetches trunk, sorry for the quick paste
[10:53] <rye> yes, test_dash.py file is broken, there is a tab before the docstring
[10:55] <sil2100> Oh
[10:55] <sil2100> Good catch
[10:56] <sil2100> Let's fix that ASAP
[10:57] <JohnLea> jussi; this is a weird corner case.  The keyboard navigation in the Dash is completely spacial, and only one element can be focused at a time.  The search box is always the focused element while you type.  If you then press the down arrow, the next element below the search box is highlighted, and this is frequently the Category Header.  That is the standard rules.  The "pressing enter to action the first search result" is a handy sho
[10:57] <JohnLea> rtcut, but it doesn't fit into the "Dash is completely spacial, element most recently interacted with has focus" framework.  However it is a handy shortcut so we have it in, but it breaks the rules
[10:57] <JohnLea> popey ^
[10:58] <popey> ta
[10:59] <jussi> JohnLea: I understand your point, but it doesnt have to be focused, just highlighted, no?
[11:02] <JohnLea> jussi; at the moment 'highlighted = focused', this would be swapping one broken rule for another, and 'highlighted = focused' is an important rule.  Also if we were to do this what would happen if a use presses the down cursor arrow after typing a search term?  Instead of the item directly below the search box being focused, the focus would jump to the item below the highlighted 1st search result which would also be very weird.
[11:02] <JohnLea> This would then break the spacial navigation
[11:06] <jussi> JohnLea: again, fair points. the way I would have expected it to be is there are 2 levels of highlight. 1 may just be a single line around the box, and then the other a full highlight, so there would be a "highlighted, but not focused" annd a highlighted and focused. I _think_ this behaviour is similar in nautilus, although I am currently on KDE at this second (my wife is using my UNity machine). It is the way how Dolphin in KDE works though
[11:07] <jussi> (Dolphin uses an underline)
[11:08] <jussi> see this image for an example: http://img.gawkerassets.com/img/17uuilz9as6u1jpg/original.jpg
=== mmrazik is now known as mmrazik|lunch
[11:12] <JohnLea> jussi; Nautilus has loads of different states:  mouse over, keyboard highlighted, keyboard highlighted and focused, keyboard highlighted and mouseover, keyboard highlighted and focused and mouseover, and also has even weirder things like two different search boxes (if you type something while a file/folder is focused a search box pops up at the bottom of the window, if you press search you get a search box at the top of the window).
[11:12] <JohnLea>  Also If the search box at the top of the window is focused, you can shift the focus to the last focused and currently highlighted item in the Nautilus window by pressing the down arrow, but you cannot return the focus to the search box by pressing the up arrow.
[11:13] <JohnLea> jussi; all in all very complex - we have managed to simplify the a lot which is a very good thing, but the cost so far is this one corner case where we have broken one rule
[11:13] <jussi> JohnLea: sure, but I don't think that invalidates the 2 state item I mentioned earlier?
[11:19] <JohnLea> jussi; two states is still adding a bunch of complexity, and in the Nautilus implementation of this you have the issue that when the user presses the down arrow the focus jumps to the highlighted item, not the item immediately below the search box.  And it adds a bunch of complexity, reducing everything to a single 'highlighted = focused' rule makes everything easier.  If there were two cases where we were breaking the rule we might
[11:19] <JohnLea> need to think about changing it, but I think one corner case that breaks it is an acceptable compromise for the reduction in complexity.

[12:06] <luv> https://github.com/luv/assorted_patches/blob/master/bamficon_windowlist.patch
[12:07] <luv> and here is a video for ayatana team: killem.al/windowlist.ogv
[12:08] <luv> the patch is against unity in ubuntu12.04 agains, but im happy to forward patch if ayatana team says they like it

[15:41] <luv> I am a bit afraid of pulling latest trunk and then installing and eventually reverting my workstation back to 5.0. How I wrote the patch was that I got the debian srcpkg with apt-src install, did my changes and then installed with dpkg-buildpackage and sudo dpkg -i , well a bit awkward but the big advantage is that everything gets installed and set up exactly the same way it does when installing the official unity package, and it's agn

[16:13] <sil2100> fginther, mterry: I'm now working on two AP failures right now
[16:13] <sil2100> fginther, mterry: one related to quicklist recycling, and the other is the standard IBus thing - but with IBus I'm still waiting for feedback from upstream
[16:13] <Trevinho> JohnLea: that's something I would have done since the beginning :P
[16:14] <rye> luv: sure
[16:14] <mterry> sil2100, nice, thanks.  Do those failures cause crashes?
[16:14] <Trevinho> JohnLea: then, I learned to live without it, but I think that new-comers would appreciate it
[16:14] <JohnLea> Trevinho; well I would have preferred something more along the lines of Windows 7 which is more graphical, but someone has done this so we have the opportunity of getting it for free.
[16:15] <sil2100> mterry: the quicklist failure causes a few tests to fail, since something seems sometimes broken in unity and it cannot detact that a quicklist is open - so it doesn't clean up properly, and the opened quicklist stays and breaks all following tests until it finally gets closed by accident
[16:15] <Trevinho> JohnLea: yeah, mee too. But as first thing
[16:16] <Trevinho> JohnLea: on the other side, we should avoid to have the quicklist too much crowded...
[16:16] <sil2100> mterry: and the ibus thing well, it's broken since quite a long time, since we want to make the tests 'better' - but ibus python support seems strangely broken, so it takes time to poke upstream about that
[16:16] <mterry> sil2100, OK...  I'm investigating why compiz leaves a core file
[16:16] <sil2100> mterry: awesome - that's also very irritating, those crashes...
[16:16] <mterry> sil2100, so sounds like we aren't stepping on each other's toes
[16:22] <dylan-m> Mainly what I'm wondering about Snap Decisions is if it's being implemented with a server over dbus, like the notification system, and how that's going to interact with the existing specification and with other desktops. Any hints?
[16:23] <dylan-m> (I'm also secretly wondering if it exists, because I've been seeing the name - and only the name - popping up for over two years).
[16:24] <rperier> lp:unity from trunk is still opened for fixes ? as I said this morning, I fixed a bug to don't close the dash while switching to commands.len, however if you open commands.lens and try to switch to home.lens (by typing Super) it is closed.

[20:12] <notgary> Is anybody home who can speak with authority on unity-jhbuild? https://launchpad.net/unity-jhbuild
[20:26] <bregma> notgary, are you having a problem with it?
[20:27] <notgary> No, just came across it and noticed the truck's not been updated since November and was wondering if it can be considered a reliable way of working with the Unity stack.
[20:37] <bregma> notgary, I and other Unity devs use it every day
[20:37] <bregma> there's a small bug, but other than that, it works better than the alternatives
[20:38] <notgary> bregma: Thanks a lot, that's all I needed to near :)
[20:44] <mterry> fginther, https://bugs.launchpad.net/unity/+bug/1108221
[20:44] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1108221 in unity (Ubuntu) "Crash in PluginClassHandler on Jenkins" [Undecided,New]
[20:45] <mterry> Does the above crash mean anything to anybody?  It's stopping the daily builds for unity
[20:59] <bregma> mterry, compiz ABI breakage?
[21:06] <mterry> bregma, which would be fixed by just another daily build?  I think we've been failing for a day or two
[21:07] <bregma> I would assume that https://code.launchpad.net/~sil2100/compiz/abi_bump_due_to_3584/+merge/145214 working its way through the system might fix it, but I'm a little vague on daily build magic
[21:09] <mterry> bregma, let's hope so
[21:09] <mterry> It would be nice if it went away "by itself"  :)
[21:10] <bregma> I'm not sure what that MP has taken over 3 hours to land so far, but perhaps there is a time dilation effect involved
[21:15] <mterry> fginther, ^ is that merge time normal?
=== salem_ is now known as _salem
[21:16]  * mterry has to head out
[22:19] <luv> well so i got pbuilder to compile raring unity dsc
[22:20] <luv> though i dont know where the resulting .deb has been created :-) and moreover, it's rather useless because i won't be able to install that .deb to 12.04lts anyway because of all the deps
[22:21] <luv> so the best way to work on trunk unity would be to install raring into VM or better yet on a dedicated dev box
[22:27] <luv> i suppose i wont be unable to compile trunk on 12.04 either
[22:43] <rye> luv: if you have a diff for the current trunk I can give it a go
[22:43] <luv> hehe, i didnt want to highligh you b/c it's quite late
[22:44] <luv> well, i wont have a diff untill I can compile and verify at least that :-/
[22:44] <luv> though im downloading raring iso now
[22:45] <rye> luv: re pbuilder -  /var/cache/pbuilder/result/ ?
[22:47] <luv> oh, i got rid of pbuilder already
[22:47] <rye> so... precompiled headers make distcc unhappy
[22:53] <fginther> bregma, https://code.launchpad.net/~sil2100/compiz/abi_bump_due_to_3584/+merge/145214 is building now
[23:19] <luv> ok raring vm installed, logging of now, good night
