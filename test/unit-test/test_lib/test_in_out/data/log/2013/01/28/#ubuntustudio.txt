[17:03] <plover> I am having a very odd problem with the Ubuntu Studio desktop which I'm not even quite sure how to describe. When I boot, a previous session is being restored. However, the desktop is mostly nonfunctional.  No windows have a top title bar, and many of them have their menu bar glued into the desktop taskbar.  So far I haven't even been able to get a terminal window that I can use. I can't get rid of the session by rebooting.

[20:14] <xrs> so far i just use openshot and blender
[20:15] <NoTchTesT> hows blender, openshot isnt mine
[20:15] <NoTchTesT> aaa
[20:15] <NoTchTesT> blender i meant
[20:15] <NoTchTesT> openshot is too simple
[20:16] <xrs> cant argue with ya there
[20:16] <xrs> blender is more for 3D modeling and special effects
[20:16] <NoTchTesT> yep
[20:16] <NoTchTesT> but i cant find something like final cut
[20:38] <zequence> NoTchTesT: Try kdenlive
[20:38] <NoTchTesT> hi zequence
[20:38] <zequence> NoTchTesT: Keep a look out for Lightworks. No releases yet though
[20:38] <NoTchTesT> and what for audio?
[20:38] <zequence> What sort of audio?
[20:39] <NoTchTesT> ardour?
[20:39] <NoTchTesT> kinda Nuendo or Pro Tools
[20:39] <zequence> Ardour is a multitrack recording Daw, so a bit like those, yes
[20:39] <NoTchTesT> for video sync
[20:40] <NoTchTesT> Xjadeo + Ardour?
[20:40] <zequence> I have no experience in that. I'm mainly into audio
[20:40] <NoTchTesT> aha
[20:40] <NoTchTesT> ive cinelerra
[20:41] <NoTchTesT> but ./configure doesnt work for me
[20:41] <NoTchTesT> to install
[20:46] <zequence> NoTchTesT: You mean, building it?
[20:47] <zequence> NoTchTesT: You're probably missing build dependencies
[20:47] <zequence> NoTchTesT: Have you tried this PPA? https://launchpad.net/~cinelerra-ppa/+archive/ppa

[23:16] <hierro59> UbuntuStudio en español?

[23:33] <NoTchTesT> looking for audio/video software any idea?
[23:34] <NoTchTesT> sync, edit, etc...
[23:57] <gartral> NoTchTesT: what are you looking to do? just basic edits, or a "complete suite"?
