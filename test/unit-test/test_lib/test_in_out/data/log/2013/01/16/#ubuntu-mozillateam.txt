[12:04] <dpm> hi chrisccoulson, I've noticed that after the 18.0 update on Quantal, my Firefox changed to English. Looking at the language packs in FF, it seems the Catalan language pack it not enabled, although the l10n package itself is installed. Any tips or ideas on how I could debug what's going on?
