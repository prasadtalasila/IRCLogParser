[15:58] <hannie> cqfd93, good afternoon. I just sent you an email
[16:07] <cqfd93> Good afternoon Hannie!
[16:07] <hannie> hi
[16:07] <hannie> I just wanted to say that you are most welcome at the meeting this weekend
[16:11] <cqfd93> I just got the message you sent to the ubuntu-manual list, thank you
[16:12] <hannie> I'm trying to catch up with my emails (117 unread :(
[16:13] <cqfd93> ouch!
[16:13] <hannie> It appears that a spammer found the ubuntu-docs mailing list address
[16:13] <hannie> So I can delete a whole bunch of them immediately
[16:14] <cqfd93> :-(
[16:28] <hannie> hey CarstenG
[16:28] <CarstenG> Hi Hannie
[16:30] <CarstenG> Did you have success with merging precise to quantal in Dutch?
[16:31] <hannie> CarstenG, yes, more than 300 fuzzies, which is better than empty
[16:31] <hannie> But I still must go through them befor approving them
[16:32] <CarstenG> Great
[16:32] <CarstenG> So you decided to publish the Dutch version?
[16:32] <CarstenG> Nice to hear :-)
[16:33] <hannie> CarstenG, I am currently applying for a job. If I get it, I will not have time for Quantal manual
[16:33] <CarstenG> We are still working on translation of precise for German...
[16:33] <hannie> Is it almost finished?
[16:34] <CarstenG> Yeah, then good luck for your new job. :-)
[16:34] <hannie> thanks, tomorrow I will hear if I passed the test
[16:34] <hannie> I had a qualification training the past week
[16:35] <CarstenG> Well, 518 strings to translate...
[16:35] <CarstenG> And I can only make suggestion...
[16:35] <hannie> ay, is there a previous completed German translation?
[16:36] <CarstenG> yes, lucid was the last one.
[16:36] <hannie> Like Lucid for instance
[16:36] <CarstenG> :-)
[16:36] <hannie> Have you merged Lucid with Precise?
[16:36] <CarstenG> Not me, but yes, we did.
[16:37] <hannie> ok
[16:37] <hannie> CarstenG, I just have a look at doodle to plan the meeting for this weekend
[16:38] <CarstenG> Yes, nice, that there are so many people who want to join.
[16:38] <cqfd93> Hi CarstenG!
[16:38] <hannie> Looks like Sunday 22:00 CET is the best option
[16:38] <CarstenG> Hi Sylvie!
[16:38] <CarstenG> Yes.
[16:39] <hannie> Only Sylvie can't be there then :(
[16:39] <CarstenG> Saturday would be better IMHO, but Sunday is also ok.
[16:40] <hannie> I will contact C7P and Kevin about this
[16:40] <hannie> Tomorrow I want to close the poll
[16:41] <cqfd93> What's 22:00 CET ? Is it 22:00 UTC ?
[16:42] <CarstenG> CET is UTC+1h
[16:42] <CarstenG> see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time
[16:43] <cqfd93> thank you
[16:44] <CarstenG> so 22 CET is 21 UTC
[16:45] <CarstenG> Ok, Iâ€™m away for ca. 30 min...
[16:45] <CarstenG> See you later.

[16:49] <cqfd93> Hannie and CarstenG: I added 20:00 UTC and 21:00 UTC to my available hours

[17:13] <CarstenG> Nice, Sylvie. So you can join :-)
[17:14] <CarstenG> And typo hunting is very good.
