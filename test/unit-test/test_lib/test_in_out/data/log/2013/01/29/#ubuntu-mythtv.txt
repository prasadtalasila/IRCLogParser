[00:07] <DarthFrog> Hi folks.  Today, I've been trying to get a Hauppauge HD-PVR 1212 (with firmware updated) to work with Mythbuntu (MythTV 0.26).  trying to watch Live TV, Mythfrontend reports "Error opening jump program file buffer" and /var/log/mythbackend.log reports: http://pastebin.com/CdA8LE66
[00:08] <DarthFrog> It was working earlier with a digital box, using the front panel composite input.  Now I'm trying to use the rear panel component input with S/PDIF audio and an HD terminal.
[00:10] <DarthFrog> Can anyone help me with this?

[16:14] <DarthFrog> tgm4883: Thank you.  The update script works again after your fix to the mythbuntu-testing-quantal PPA yesterday.
[16:24] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, :)
[16:25] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  Did you happen to see the request for help I made yesterday regarding the problems I was having with a Hauppage HD-PVR?
[16:26] <tgm4883> nope
[16:26] <DarthFrog> [January 28, 2013] [04:07:51 PM] <DarthFrog> Hi folks.

[16:26] <DarthFrog> [January 28, 2013] [04:08:51 PM] <DarthFrog> It was working earlier with a digital box, using the front panel composite input.  Now I'm trying to use the rear panel component input with S/PDIF audio and an HD terminal.
[16:43] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, when you switched to component, did you remove and readd it? or did you just change the input?
[16:44] <DarthFrog> Changed the input.
[16:45] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, I assume it's showing up as /dev/videoX?
[16:45] <DarthFrog>  /dev/video0
[16:46] <DarthFrog> I'll try removing the "card" from Myth and re-add it.
[16:46] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, ok
[16:48] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  I bow before your wisdom. :-)
[16:48] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, :)
[16:49] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, do you have other /dev/videoX devices?
[16:49] <DarthFrog> Yes, a web cam on /dev/video1
[16:49] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, is it possible they switched numbers on boot?
[16:50] <tgm4883> when I used my HDPVR, I had udev symlink it to /dev/hdpvr
[16:50] <tgm4883> then told mythtv to use that
[16:50] <DarthFrog> the webcam used to be /dev/video0 but connecting the HDPVR booted it to /dev/video1
[16:50] <tgm4883> ok
[16:51] <DarthFrog> But once I get this working (on my desktop machine), I'll be putting a couple of HD-PVRs on a dedicated backend machine and they will be the only video devices.
[16:52] <DarthFrog> Are you using the IR blaster that the HD-PVR provides to change channels on a cable box?
[16:52] <tgm4883> I don't use my HDPVR anymore, but I used firewire for changing channels when I didn
[16:52] <tgm4883> did
[16:54] <DarthFrog> Once again, many thanks for your most excellent help.  If you're ever in the Vancouver, BC, region I owe you multiple beers! :-)
[16:54] <tgm4883> heh, not too far off
[16:54] <tgm4883> Oregon, USA
[16:55] <DarthFrog> Whereabouts?   I'm occasionaly in Portland.
[16:59] <tgm4883> Salem
[17:03] <DarthFrog> Nice town.
[17:06] <DarthFrog> Oh flaming hell.  The HDPVR is recording in fits & spurts.  A few seconds of recording, then stops for a few more.  The mythbackend log is still reporting the inability to set video recording rates due to bad file descriptors. :-(
[17:06] <Zinn> DarthFrog: Please watch your language.
[17:06] <DarthFrog> Sorry Botty.
[17:06] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, what firmware you have on there?
[17:06] <DarthFrog> Oh flaming nuisance, I meant. :-)
[17:07] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  The latest.  I updated it a few days ago.
[17:07] <tgm4883> rhpot1991, do you still use your hdpvr? ^
[17:07] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, probably worth checking if a 'cat /dev/video0 > test.mpg' for a few seconds/minutes produces no issues
[17:08] <DarthFrog> OK, I'll give it a shot.  BRB
[17:09] <DarthFrog> It worked for about ten seconds then died.
[17:10] <DarthFrog> Nice picture for that 10 seconds, though. :-)
[17:16] <tgm4883> hmm
[17:16] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, are you plugged into a USB2 port?
[17:16] <tgm4883> and not USB1.1
[17:17] <DarthFrog> Yes, USB2.    I could go into a USB3.
[17:17] <tgm4883> that shouldn't be necessary
[17:17] <tgm4883> anything in dmesg/syslog?
[17:19] <DarthFrog> Nothing in dmesg.  Syslog only has entries for the logserver.
[17:20] <DarthFrog> http://pastebin.com/5tJmrYrS
[17:21] <DarthFrog> the segfault in mythlogserver probably came about from me killing myth-backend to do the video capture.
[17:26] <tgm4883> rhpot1991, superm1 thoughts ^
[17:26] <tgm4883> one of you had a HDPVR, i'm pretty sure
[17:29] <DarthFrog> tgm4883:  Thanks for your help.  I'm thinking that this is a HD-PVR driver issue and not a Mythbuntu issue.  So I'm thinking that I'll reboot and see if the problem re-occurs.  If it does, as I suspect it will, I'll ask for help in #mythtv-users.
[17:31] <tgm4883> DarthFrog, ok
[20:44] <rhpot1991> tgm4883: is he gone?
[20:44] <rhpot1991> I still have my hdpvr
[20:44] <tgm4883> rhpot1991, yea, but he is usually around
[22:03] <sabhain> has gnome3 fixed the mouse focus thing yet?
[22:03] <sabhain> .. rather .. has it be restored as an option?
