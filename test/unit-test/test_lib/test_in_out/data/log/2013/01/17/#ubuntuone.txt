[11:04] <gatox> good morning!
[12:18] <mandel> rye, now I have a dead compiz.. fuuu
[12:19] <rye> mandel: things getting better
[12:19] <rye> are
[12:19] <mandel> rye, well, atm I have no widows manager.. major PITA

[12:20] <mandel> rye, yes, I stupidly did an upgrade and broke everything...
[12:20] <rye> mandel: I have rearranged XFCE panels to look like unity so I am a bit more comfortable
[12:20] <mandel> rye, I think I'm going to install XFCE just in case this happens again
[12:20] <mandel> rye, it is gnome/glib based right?
[12:20] <rye> mandel: gtk based, yes
[12:21] <rye> mandel: but one issue is that xubuntu-desktop installs its own indicator for upgrade/apport information and its own notification daemon, but I can live with this

[12:25] <rye> mandel: why?
[12:27] <mandel> rye, I think is a combination of a broken compiz and nvidia
