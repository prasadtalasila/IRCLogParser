[02:07] <hosses> G: I've heard you might be running Ubuntu on an Intel D33217GKE. If so, does it have any issues?
[02:16] <hads> DC3217IYE is the box with the board in
[02:17] <hosses> my bad; that's what I meant
[03:07] <G> hosses: I am running Ubuntu now, there is a pretty big issue where if you use the HDMI port next to the LAN port, your network will just go bad
[03:08] <G> hosses: that is an issue with all OSes though, & covered in the thread at http://communities.intel.com/message/177859#177859
[03:08] <G> hosses: other than that, it's working far better than I expected
[03:08] <hosses> Crikey. But when using the 1x good HDMI its ok?
[03:09] <G> yep, if you use the HDMI next to USB ports, all good
[03:09] <G> I've got an actual ticket open with Intel about it so I should get updates when they work out why
[03:09] <hosses> Sweet. 1080p playback good?
[03:09]  * G wonders if it's lack of shielding or something tbh
[03:10] <G> hosses: yeah, handles TV3's HD no problems - I also seem to have issues with TV3's HD & mythfrontend, but all seems to be good via xbmc on that NUC
[03:11] <hosses> Cool. Biggest requirement for me is solid 1080p playback in XBMC, so this sounds ideal
[03:12] <G> yeah, I'll put my normal disclaimer about 'individual mileage may vary'
[05:45] <hads> G: Ah it was due to the HDMI port? Weird. I guess I only ever used the other port.
[07:43] <G> hads: yeah, thats what I concluded, subconciously every test I did, I had it plugged into the 'wrong' HDMI port
