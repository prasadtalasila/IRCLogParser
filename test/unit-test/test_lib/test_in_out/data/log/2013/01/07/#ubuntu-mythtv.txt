[16:38] <stuartm> I should be able to upgrade to mythbuntu (ubuntu) 12.04 via the CD?
[16:39] <tgm4883> hmm
[16:39] <tgm4883> stuartm, I want to say yes, but I think there may have been a serious issue with that
[16:39] <stuartm> can't do an online upgrade because it requires too much space (much more than previous upgrades)
[16:40] <tgm4883> stuartm, where are your recordings stored? IIRC, the issue is that it wiped /var
[16:40] <stuartm> not in /var :)
[16:40] <tgm4883> then IIRC it should work. I think that was the only issue
[16:41] <stuartm> ok thanks
[16:50] <tgm4883> stuartm, hold up
[16:50] <tgm4883> !bug 992241
[16:50] <Zinn> Bug 992241 in mythbuntu "Upgrading using the live cd wipes /var/lib/mythtv/*" [Critical, Fix Released] http://www.launchpad.net/bugs/992241
[16:51] <tgm4883> That fix should be in 12.04.1
[16:51] <tgm4883> it's not in the 12.04 release (although you probably have the 12.04.1 ISO if you downloaded it from the website
[16:52] <tgm4883> after aug 23
[18:34] <stuartm> tgm4883: thanks
[18:55] <Igramul> Hi, I'm trying to get my remote to work. irw output looks find, I ran mythbuntu-lirc-generate, the config looks fine.
[18:55] <Igramul> But the remote is not working. Any ideas how to proceed?
[20:35] <Igramul> found it: it was a wrong lircd-socket configured in mythtv
[21:38] <whyzzyrd> evening. Is there a howto to build a diskless slave backend and front end anywhere?
[21:38] <whyzzyrd> the old docs for ltsp (--mythbuntu etc) don't appear to work any longer
[21:39] <rhpot1991> whyzzyrd: as far as I'm aware those docs are considerably out of date
[21:39] <whyzzyrd> ah, but so was my previously working system.. :)
[21:39] <rhpot1991> IMO there is no reason to do diskless anymore, buy a $5 usb drive and be done with it
[21:40] <whyzzyrd> I wanted to bump the kernel, but b0rked the whole contraption, so wanted to basically start again
[21:41] <whyzzyrd> I suppose you have a point, but I've been doing diskless for some time, as it's less likely to be screwed up by the kids
[21:41] <whyzzyrd> ironically, it was me that screwed it up though
[21:44] <sabhain> whyzzrd you had a diskless slave backend??
[21:44] <whyzzyrd> aye
[21:45] <whyzzyrd> nfs back into the one with the disks
[21:45] <tgm4883> Is there much of a chance that kinds would mess up a backend system?
[21:45] <sabhain> I've been running 3 diskless frontends for several years, and just this past weekend started to contemplate adding a slave backend to my setup.
[21:45] <sabhain> previous to using diskless server, I used to keep the / drive for all the front ends on the core, and get to them via an NFS boot
[21:46] <sabhain> using /boot on a cflash drive
[21:46] <sabhain> seems to me that grub2 killed any chance of that working again.
[21:46] <whyzzyrd> I suppose if I explain it'd be easier. I had one "master" box, with 3T of disk in and one DVB-S Tuner. I also had a pair of diskless frontends. I wanted a pair of DVB-T tuners, and the frontends had slots (and proximate antenna cables)..
[21:47] <whyzzyrd> so both my diskless frontends also became slave backends
[21:47] <sabhain> did you add the backend components/setup from within the booted front end, or was there a way to do it through chroot?
[21:47] <whyzzyrd> Next I bought a DVB-S2 card ... and needed a newer kernel than I had. So, I tried a rebuild.
[21:47] <whyzzyrd> added it from within the booted front ned
[21:47] <whyzzyrd> into the overlay fs
[21:48] <sabhain> wow!  that's really cool.
[21:49] <whyzzyrd> well, it was when it worked.
[21:49] <sabhain> is diskless-server still a real package?
[21:49] <whyzzyrd> Because the frontends had the same DVB-T cards in, the remote controls were even interchangeable
[21:50] <whyzzyrd> in any case, I'd actually like to simply rebuild the mythbuntu-diskless boot images, and mount my old overlay onto the top of it.
[21:50] <sabhain> which version?
[21:50] <whyzzyrd> they were 11.x IIRC
[21:51] <sabhain> and now, you're trying for 12.04?
[21:51] <whyzzyrd> I need a 3.2 series kernel for the DVB-S2 card to be stable apparently
[21:52] <sabhain> oof .. just checked my folder of resources for building the images, and the first 2 links are non-existant.  Wish I had webclipped those.
[21:54] <whyzzyrd> it appears that it's all changed, and maybe not for the better as far as it 'just work'ing is concerned
[21:56] <sabhain> I last did it on 10.04 LTS.  Last night I built a test system from spare parts (not one of my production units).  I think perhaps I'm going to have to prove I can do it on the offline system first.
[21:57] <sabhain> for me the hardest part was always getting the PXE arguments working and passed correctly by my router to the front ends
[21:57] <sabhain> you're having challenges actually building the ltsp?
[21:57] <whyzzyrd> managed to get one of my ancient images to go, but I'd rather get a newer kernel into it
[21:57] <whyzzyrd> it's building a mythbuntu LTSP that appears to be a problem now.
[22:00] <whyzzyrd> there's no longer the "just build a mythbuntu" image option
[22:01] <sabhain> whyzzyrd have you seen this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1967811
[22:03] <whyzzyrd> yeah, but that'll get me building a whole new way of it working, rather than an image that works the old way :)
[22:04] <sabhain> agree .. this is not a good read.  I'm glad I jumped in here when I did.
[22:04] <sabhain> would have waded into a disaster without know it!
[22:05] <whyzzyrd> this sort of thing really dents the wife acceptance factor :)
[22:06] <sabhain> you're not kidding.  And my kids don't know anything different.  They can't understand why they can't go to their friends' house and just cue up a movie.
[22:06]  * sabhain longs for the days of laga
[22:06] <whyzzyrd> does rather look like I'll have to bite the bullet and do iot properly though
[22:07] <sabhain> ?properly?  .. Properly was with ltsp where you could update all the front ends at once.
[22:07] <sabhain> ... of course once working, you NEVER update anything, lol.
[22:08] <whyzzyrd> I did upgrade from 10 to 11 without great fanfare IIRC
[22:09] <sabhain> I went from 8.04 to 10.04 and it was smooth.
[22:09] <sabhain> now I think I want to be on 12.04 for some of the new netvision stuff and better vdpau with the video cards
[22:13] <whyzzyrd> my front end's an atom, so no vpdau, but I've only got SD
[22:16] <sabhain> seems like a few people have gotten the images to build out there, but the overlay changes don't stick for some reason.
[22:17] <whyzzyrd> indeed, which is a pain
[22:19] <whyzzyrd> though as rhpot1991 noted earlier, putting a $5 USB key in the back and booting off that does seem like a reasonably good option
[22:20] <whyzzyrd> it's at least 100% understandable ..
[22:27] <sabhain> .. yep .. pendulum swings I guess.  About 4 years ago here someone asked why I was messing around with NFS boot an not using diskless.
[22:30] <sabhain> would minimyth work with a mythbuntu backend?
[22:32] <whyzzyrd> can't see why it wouldn't
[22:32] <whyzzyrd> uncharacteristically, given it took me so long to make all this fly in the first place, I actually took notes, and backups of the important bits ...
[22:42] <sabhain> whyzzrd: this may give me some hope: http://www.mentby.com/Group/mythtv-users/best-optionshowto-for-diskless-frontends.html
[22:50] <dkeith> hi
[22:50] <dkeith> nm
[22:52] <whyzzyrd> sabhain, that's a reasonably interesting read.
[22:52] <whyzzyrd> If I find some time, I'll bring some more old junk home and build a test setup in my garage
[22:53] <sabhain> I'll keep popping in here to see how it goes.  I have my "new-to-me" second hand HD-PVR to play with first, so it might be the weekend before I move on updating LTSP & my Core.
[22:54] <whyzzyrd> it'll be longer away than that for me I think :)
[22:54] <whyzzyrd> I've got it sortaworkign
[22:54] <whyzzyrd> with an old image I kept for a rainy day, and a 3.0 kernel
[22:56] <sabhain> I'm game to try the fat-client thing being discussed here to get over the missing --mythbuntu argument.  But I probably won't spend more than a few sessions trying to get the NFS/Overlay thing working.
[22:56] <sabhain> Could be USB drives for me after that.  I'm certain it'll be slower than the LAN though.
[22:56] <whyzzyrd> without the NFS/Overlay, it's pretty much useless to me..
[22:56] <whyzzyrd> USB drives will be slower than GE lan ..
[22:57] <sabhain> and me too .. I have different remotes and varying hardware everywhere.
[22:57] <whyzzyrd> I've tried to keep mine sane, but given it's mostly out of our dumpster pile at work :)
[22:58] <whyzzyrd> the TV cards, of course, weren't though ...
