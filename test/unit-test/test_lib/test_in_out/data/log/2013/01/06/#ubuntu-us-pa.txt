[11:36] <HowdyDoody> morning rmg51 and everyone
[12:31] <waltman> Again with the snow and the fog?
[16:04] <ChinnoDog> No snow or fog here.
[16:04] <pleia2> a little snow here, but it's melting
[16:34] <MutantTurkey> some snow, basically all melted, road are dry.
[18:26] <ChinnoDog> The one time I want to read a book from the ACM library the book site is under maintanence
[18:26] <ChinnoDog> pfft
[18:27]  * ChinnoDog smacks Books24x7 around a bit with a large trout
[18:42] <jedijf> it always works that way
[18:42] <jedijf> murphy dude
[18:50] <ChinnoDog> murphy: 1, ChinnoDog: 0
[18:55] <ChinnoDog> Anyone here write apps with Qt?
[18:58] <ChinnoDog> I was looking around for the best language to use to write apps for .NET, Android, and iOS and good old C++ with Qt seems to be a winner
[19:06] <ChinnoDog> Seems like you can write an app for pretty much any platform with C++/Qt
[19:58] <MutantTurkey> since nokia sold Qt, its' looking ironically better for mobile development than ever
[20:00] <ChinnoDog> I think I need to become a C++/Qt expert asap. I have stuff to write.
[22:56] <waltman> I've discovered a soccer team for pleia2 to root for!
