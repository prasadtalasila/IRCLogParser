[00:14] <Que20> Je cherche de l'aide : J'ai une tres mauvaise connexion depuis que je suis sous Xubuntu, je ne sais pas pourquoi. J'ai pourtant éssayé de réinstaller le driver de mon dongle wifi (rtl8187) mais rien y fait... Help! :'(

[00:15] <Que20> Thank you
[00:30] <hansin> Recently installed Xubuntu 12.10 in a virtual machine so I could code in a Linux environment while also in Windows. This is probably the best Linux desktop experience I have had to date, and I have installed many distros. So kudos on that.\
[00:30] <Siilence> Felt exactly the same way the first time I installed it.
[00:30] <Siilence> :)
[00:31] <hansin> The fonts look really nice, and it is cool to finally be able to add TT fonts by dropping them in the appropriate folder and have then just work (not sure when that transition happened.
[00:31] <hansin> What I am excited for, and I know this is some time off, but seeing Xfce transitioned to GTK3 and then able to be run from Wayland.
[00:33] <hansin> But basically wanted to give a kudos out to the dev team. I always end up dumping Linux because the desktop experience just is not up to par from me, but I am writing more web type code, and nice to code in a decent Posix environment, in fact for me better than OSX in that most server are Linux based. So really happy with the Xubuntu 12.10 experience.
[00:37] <hansin> Btw, see that Xfce 4.12, which is a transition towards GTK3 (cool) is set to be released in early March. Any chance it will make it into Xubuntu 13.04 as default, or has that not been decided yet? Thanks Btw.
[00:53] <nicholosophy> hansin, as long as it doesn't transition to looking like gnome3, I'll be happy :p
[00:53] <nicholosophy> For someone who has used linux on and off for over a decade, I love xubuntu. I just switched full time to it and deleted Windows 8 last night.
[00:54] <nicholosophy> although I do have a couple of windows VMs (Win 8 and XP) for work stuff
[00:56] <hansin> nicholosophy: From what I have seen said about this in various places, the Xfce devs are committed to keeping a more "traditional" desktop paradigm that many people are used to and actually find productive for their workflow. Many of us who use computers to do certain tasks don't care about the distractions that the "social" desktop brings about, or will ever use a tablet or similar for most...
[00:56] <hansin> ...productivity. Let's face it, screen real estate matters, along with other issues.
[01:01] <hansin> There are maybe some interesting ideas that could available to the traditional desktop, things like Spotlight in OSX or the cross-platform open source Launchy, both app launchers triggered by Alt-Space (Alt-2 is not ideal, but I suppose I could re-map). I also like to install Guake for a drop-down terminal. Basically, a solid core desktop where maybe some cool supplemental programs that...
[01:01] <hansin> ...people could pick and choose (so if you wanted HUD type thing, you could add it.) Anyway, solid Xfce on Wayland might be a great core.
[01:01] <nicholosophy> hansin, amen!
[01:02] <hansin> As they say, KISS, but not so simple that you cannot customize to your liking.
[01:02] <hansin> Just simple in the sense of a well thought out solid core.
[01:04] <hansin> At least that is my take ;)
[01:50] <fmjunkie> Hi guys,, I was hoping someone could answer some questions for me about getting compiz to work in Xubuntu 12.04?
[01:51] <pleia2> we won't know until you ask :) but keep in mind that it's not an official supported configuration
[01:52] <fmjunkie> oh ok,, well i seem to be having trouble with the whole decorator part.. this is that terminal says after i run compiz --replace "Couldn't find a perfect decorator match; trying all decorators
[01:52] <fmjunkie> Found no decorator to start
[01:52] <fmjunkie> "
[01:54] <fmjunkie> anyone know what I can do to fix this?
[02:21] <nicholosophy> anyone know if there is a ppa for thunar dropbox plugin?
[02:42] <Cheri703> wadapdoc: best to ask in a public channel before pm'ing people. if you have questions you can ask here.
[02:43] <wadapdoc> oh okey
[02:50] <wadapdoc> Cheri703 I hope you can help me out cause I'm kinda lost. Anyway this is the problem... yesterday while I was updating some software on a Win7 the screen froze and I waited for a couple of minutes and decided to reboot the PC. After rebooting the PC I couldn't get past a screen that kept on showing up no matter what I did. The error that it was showing was 0xc000009 and that's effecting some I/O device or something.
[02:53] <xubuntu395> How do I create RAID-1 across two partitions before installing XUbuntu 12.10?
[02:53] <wadapdoc> Friend of mine told me to do a Xubuntu-to-desktop boot and using the try out setting see if my HDD is alive and if I can recover some files which I did now is the funny part. After I recovered everything I decided to erase everything and install the Xubuntu package but after getting several errors while installing and constant rebooting somehow it worked but I'm getting stuck again after the Ubuntu booting map.
[02:54] <wadapdoc> After I choose to boot ubuntu the screen frezes and after a while I get some error and few more kernel fails.
[02:55] <Unit193> wadapdoc: Pretty sure you have a dead/dieing harddrive.
[02:55] <wadapdoc> Can it be stuck on a bad sector that over loops somehow?
[02:56] <wadapdoc> I haven't used any error fixing commands like chkdsk
[02:57] <Unit193> What's the brand?
[02:57] <wadapdoc> it's an old SATA Hard
[02:58] <wadapdoc> the funny thing is I atm while I'm booted from the usb I can acsses the HDD via Gigolo
[02:58] <Unit193> If it is seagate, try http://www.seagate.com/staticfiles/support/seatools/seatools-test-codes.html
[02:58] <wadapdoc> I can connect to it.
[02:58] <wadapdoc> I remember the thing failing on some vmlinuz file or command
[02:59] <wadapdoc> I don't know I'm new to Linux and learning but I like it.
[03:09] <wadapdoc> Unit193: Any other ideas?
[03:11] <Unit193> As I said, check the harddrive.  Using seatools for seagate, WD ones for wd, or maybe mhdd.
[03:13] <wadapdoc> Haha I'm not sure how.
[03:15] <wadapdoc> I can't use the for Windows file I guess the only option is the dos one.
[03:19] <wadapdoc> Unit193: what do I do once I dl the dos iso? I'm a complete noob.
[03:19] <wadapdoc> Oh crap I don't have a DVD rom to burn the thing to a CD.
[03:19] <GridCube> !unetbootin
[03:19] <ubottu> For information about installing Ubuntu from USB flash drives, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick - For a persistent live USB install, see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent
[03:20] <wadapdoc> Is that for me?
[03:23] <GridCube> if you dont have dvd's you can use a pendrive yes, wadapdoc
[03:23] <wadapdoc> but I got the Xubuntu boot thingy on the USB
[03:26] <GridCube> oh
[03:26] <GridCube> what do you want to burn to a dvd then?
[03:27] <wadapdoc> Unit193 suggested that I try seagate tools to see what's wrong with my HDD.
[03:29] <wadapdoc> Also when I was installing Xubuntu I never configured the partitions.
[03:29] <wadapdoc> And I just learned that I need to configure them.
[03:32] <wadapdoc> It looks like I got one ext4 type partition without any mount command which is 248gig and 2 others swap that are each 1071mb
[03:32] <GridCube> if you just choose to use the whole disk the installer takes care of that
[03:34] <wadapdoc> but at the Used subpanel thingy it shows Unknown for the 248gig partition
[03:34] <wadapdoc> damn this is weird
[03:35] <GridCube> wadapdoc, open a terminal and type: sudo fdisk -l
[03:35] <GridCube> and paste the result to a pastebin

=== Juvenal_ is now known as Juvenal
[03:40] <Juvenal> hello, long time linux/ubuntu/gnome user here. am installing xubuntu for the first time ever as we speak
[03:40] <Juvenal> anyone have any tips or extensions or 'need to have/know' things for xfce?
[03:41] <wadapdoc> Glad to have you here
[03:41] <Juvenal> glad to be here, gnome was making me sick
[03:41] <wadapdoc> Yeah those gnomes
[03:42] <wadapdoc> Anyway I'm new here and new to linux/gnome/ubuntu
[03:42] <Juvenal> i was using gnome 2 on ubuntu 11.10 before, and there were quite a few awful ui bugs introduced when ubuntu shifted to gnome 3
[03:43] <wadapdoc> GridCube: any info?
[03:44] <GridCube> wadapdoc, can you paste the results of df aswell please
[03:45] <Juvenal> wadapdoc, whats the issue you were having?
[03:45] <wadapdoc> sure just tell me how do I do that
[03:46] <wadapdoc> I'm having some issues with my HDD as it looks like
[03:47] <GridCube> wadapdoc, on a terminal, type df and press enter
[03:47] <wadapdoc> oh
[03:48] <wadapdoc> here it is GridCube http://pastebin.com/rpERi16k
[03:48] <GridCube> df -h to get human readable numbers :P
[03:48] <wadapdoc> one sec
[03:49] <GridCube> D:
[03:49] <GridCube> i... what?
[03:49] <GridCube> your partitions are all sort of weird
[03:49] <wadapdoc> http://pastebin.com/hNQyjRyg
[03:50] <wadapdoc> yeah I know!
[03:50] <wadapdoc> I just don't know what the hell happened
[03:50] <Juvenal> are you booted to a livecd?
[03:50] <wadapdoc> yes from a USB
[03:50] <hansin> Juvenal: maybe just dig around in the settings manager ( Start | Settings Manager ) a bit and explore. I am not an expert, but finds it pretty intuitive. I like to clean up to my liking like removing icons from menus, set background, move to a single Gnome/Windows style panel to the bottom (so delete launcher at bottom and move top panel to below), etc. I guess just explore it a bit, but I...
[03:50] <hansin> ...really like Xfce in the latest Xubuntu. They did a good job with this distro I think.
[03:50] <GridCube> oh... right... XD live session
[03:50] <GridCube> thats why the all sort of weirds
[03:50] <Juvenal> lol
[03:51] <Juvenal> GridCube, you did the same thing i did "wtf, that looks like a live session"
[03:51] <wadapdoc> I don't know what you guys saw but all I saw was bunch of numbers and went "wtf do all these numbers mean!?"
[03:51] <GridCube> i forgot about that part
[03:51] <wadapdoc> lol
[03:51] <GridCube> wadapdoc, its pretty simple if you take the time to read it
[03:52] <GridCube> not the fdisk -l part though, that might take more time
[03:52] <wadapdoc> :D
[03:52] <hansin> wadapdoc: I am not totally following, but do you know for sure you installed, or are you just running from the LiveCD and have not installed to the harddrive yet?
[03:52] <wadapdoc> so any ideas how we should fix this GridCube?
[03:52] <hansin> LiveUSB I mean ;)
[03:52] <GridCube> wadapdoc, you see the problem is here: Disk /dev/mapper/nvidia_ffbfhbci1 doesn't contain a valid partition table
[03:53] <wadapdoc> I have installed but when I boot Xubuntu without the LiveUSB it fails
[03:53] <GridCube> thats what fdisk -l is saying, thats your / partition
[03:53] <Juvenal> hmm, well this isnt a great start. not booting after install
[03:53] <Juvenal> likely the ufi bootloader wasnt installed correctly..
[03:53] <wadapdoc> but when I connect to the drive whie Gigolo from the LiveUSB
[03:53] <wadapdoc> I can see the installation files
[03:53] <GridCube> yes
[03:54] <wadapdoc> I think the issue might be I haven't installed the thing properlly with the partitions
[03:54] <GridCube> your partition tables are broken, you can try using testdisk to recover it
[03:54] <wadapdoc> how? where?
[03:54] <GridCube> but i dont recommend you to use testdisk because its fairly complex
[03:54] <wadapdoc> oh
[03:54] <GridCube> !testdisk
[03:55] <GridCube> well
[03:55] <GridCube> !info testdisk
[03:55] <ubottu> testdisk (source: testdisk): Partition scanner and disk recovery tool. In component universe, is optional. Version 6.13-1ubuntu1 (quantal), package size 516 kB, installed size 1201 kB
[03:55] <wadapdoc> how do I use that
[03:56] <GridCube> wadapdoc, http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk_Step_By_Step
[03:56] <GridCube> but as i said, fairly complex
[03:56] <GridCube> i've done it a few times though
[03:56] <wadapdoc> oh so what do you suggest?
[03:57] <GridCube> you can try that, or reformat and use some tool like chkdsk to separate faulty sectors
[03:58] <GridCube> and try the installation again
[03:58] <wadapdoc> lets go with the option of reformat
[03:59] <wadapdoc> can you gudie me through pretty please
[03:59] <GridCube> sorry, gotta go, but do read this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck
[03:59] <wadapdoc> aww man ty anyway
[03:59] <wadapdoc> have a nice day
[04:00] <GridCube> :D night actually, sleepy sleep tiems
[04:00] <GridCube> !uefi | Juvenal if you are having problems with uefi please read this
[04:00] <ubottu> Juvenal if you are having problems with uefi please read this: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[04:01] <GridCube> bye :)
[04:02] <hansin> wadapdoc: you might have issues with raid (looks like you ION board might have a RAID setting in the BIOS ???). At least, this is what made me thing so - see #8: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1305811
[04:03] <hansin> And then there is fail because GRUB cannot access these partitions. Well, something like that. Though was an issue with an earlier Ubuntu release.
[04:03] <wadapdoc> what do you suggest?
[04:06] <hansin> wadapdoc: maybe read through the thread. I have not done much with RAID set ups, and I have never seen these alternate device entries for Nvidia. If you know how to access the BIOS, maybe see if there are RAID setting for the SATA controller, and just disable RAID. Of course you would then need to do a reinstall. But do take a look at the thread from the above link as there seemed some info.'
[04:06] <wadapdoc> Alright thank you very much.
[04:09] <hansin> wadapdoc: me personally, if I was only going to use one drive (do you know what RAID is by the way, just curious?), I would get into the BIOS and disable any RAID. But the whole thread seems to be a pretty good read and I actually learned something ;)
[04:10] <hansin> wadapdoc: just curious, but what is your computer or motherboard brand/model?
[04:13] <wadapdoc> I don't know what RAID is but I read earlier on some thread something about it and honestly I was trying to do something there but only ended up as I remember clearing the whole HDD.
[04:13] <wadapdoc> The motherboard model on this PC is very old one it's a MSI n1996 if I'm not mistaken
[04:15] <wadapdoc> but I'm pretty sure that I disabled the RAID thing and set it to IDE.
[04:17] <hansin> wadapdoc: Ok. Well, RAID (redundant array of independent/inexpensive disks) is for using multiple drives where you can do things like mirror the drives so if one crashes you do not lose data, or you can "stripe" data so things things are accessed twice as fast (data split between drives), etc. But you wouldn't need that with one drive.
[04:17] <wadapdoc> Yeah I was just looking through it's settings what it does.
[04:18] <hansin> Btw, I am only guessing it is a RAID thing from what I was seeing, but could be wrong. You must have had some sort of Nvidia chipset in there if it is giving you /dev/mapper/nvida... entries in your partition table. But I am not an expert.
[04:19] <wadapdoc> anyway I tried fsck /dev/sdb1 and it says the filesystem is mounted and that if I continue it can cause filesystem damage.
[04:19] <hansin> yeah, because /dev/sdb1 is you USB stick.
[04:20] <wadapdoc> Oh
[04:21] <hansin> I would probably dig through the BIOS a bit again and make sure things look good for you SATA controller and hard drive settings. In fact, I would set the SATA controller to SATA if you can (not IDE). Then I would boot again into the USB and do a clean install (tell it to use the whole drive.) It should repartition it all for you.
[04:21] <wadapdoc> I wrote fscsk /dev/mapper/nividia/ffbfhbci1 to try and enter the HDD but it says Permission denied and that I Don't have access to it hmm
[04:22] <wadapdoc> I have AHCI, RAID and IDE
[04:22] <dancat> I am using gmusicbrowser and it seems not to support m4a ... is there a work around anyone knows about?
[04:23] <dancat> asking here since this is the stock audio of xubuntu
[04:24] <hansin> FYI, you hard drive should be /dev/sda -- the whole drive, and each partition /dev/sda1 /dev/sda2 etc.
[04:24] <hansin> Btw, I'd probaly go with AHCI: http://www.diffen.com/difference/AHCI_vs_IDE
[04:25] <wadapdoc> alright
[04:25] <wadapdoc> I'll be back just to try these things
[04:27] <Juvenal> ah, silly me
[04:27] <hansin> wadapdoc: one last thing...
[04:27] <Juvenal> didnt use the right efi boot partition
[04:28] <hansin> wadapdoc: Just for your info, you sda1 is a primary partition, and your sda2 in the second primary which contain the extended sda5 as SWAP. Basically, that part looks like it should be. Give it a go ( change to ACHI and do a clean reinstall ), and let us know how it goes!
[04:29] <hansin> wadapdoc: Or you could first try and just change the BIOS setting and see if current install boots (worth a try) and only reinstall if no boot.
[04:30] <Juvenal> dancat, it looks like gmusicbrowser claims support for m4a in 1.1.x
[04:30] <Juvenal> which is an RC
[04:31] <Juvenal> v1.1.2 added support
[04:33] <Juvenal> dancat, what release are you using? anything over 10.04 should have gmusicbrowser 1.1.x
[04:34] <dancat> Okay, I am learning the vocab. My m4a(s) are encoded with AAC and they do not show up in gmusicbrowser but show and play in other media programs
[04:34] <dancat> version:
[04:34] <dancat> 1.1.9
[04:35] <Juvenal> sounds like a bug in gmusicbrowser then
[04:35] <Juvenal> or an issue with your specific m4a's
[04:35] <Juvenal> since 1.1.2+ claims support for m4a
[04:36] <dancat> I've looked everywhere for an answer and the only thing I am seeing is http://forum.gmusicbrowser.org/index.php?topic=604.msg2859#msg2859
[04:36] <dancat> which didn't make that much sense to me but...
[04:39] <Juvenal> do your m4a files have id3v2 tags?
[04:40] <dancat> let me see... I believe they are tags with the aac version tagging tool but standby
[04:41] <Cheri703> is there a way to run the "normal" (gnome?) ubuntu clock applet on an xfce panel? I miss my world clock...
[04:42] <Cheri703> nvm, I think I found something
[04:42] <Juvenal> Cheri703, share? just switched to xfce and world clock is nice
[04:42] <Cheri703> haven't tried it yet, but: http://helpdeskgeek.com/linux-tips/run-gnome-applets-in-the-xfce-panel/
[04:43] <Cheri703> going to in a sec
[04:43] <dancat> no id3tag
[04:43] <Cheri703> getting my ctrl-alt-t set up to open terminal, I miss that too :)
[04:43] <dancat> will id3 tags on a AAC file corrupt the file?
[04:44] <Juvenal> heh, same Cheri703
[04:44] <Cheri703> hmm...ok, so it's saying that program isn't available, one sec
[04:45] <Juvenal> xfce4-terminal messed me up
[04:45] <Juvenal> so used to 'gnome-terminal'
[04:45] <Cheri703> heh
[04:45] <Cheri703> (for the record, you can set the keyboard shortcut under settings > keyboard
[04:45] <Cheri703> )
[04:46] <Juvenal> yep, found that a minute ago
[04:46] <Cheri703> looks like "xfce4-goodies" is the thing that'll give xfapplets
[04:47] <Juvenal> hmm
[04:47] <Cheri703> and xfapplets allows gnome applets
[04:47] <Juvenal> ok, so dual monitors here
[04:47] <Cheri703> me too :)
[04:47] <Juvenal> where do i change that
[04:47] <Juvenal> right now its just mirrored
[04:47] <Juvenal> and in display i dont see options to change that
[04:47] <Cheri703> ah, so....if you're using xubuntu out of the box you have to set it up with arandr
[04:48] <Cheri703> I am using xfce 4.12 (which is pre pre beta at the moment) and it allows it
[04:48] <Juvenal> brilliant
[04:48] <Cheri703> this explains both options: http://www.webupd8.org/2012/11/how-to-use-multiple-monitors-in-xubuntu.html
[04:48] <Juvenal> works ;)
[04:49] <Juvenal> Cheri703, did you recently switch from gnome to xfce too? lol
[04:49] <Cheri703> yeah :) like....thursday
[04:50] <Juvenal> hah, i did the same, but like an hour ago xd
[04:50] <timaaa> Hello im in the middle of setting up xbuntu and im wondering what it means when it. Says no root file.
[04:50] <Cheri703> brb, rebooting
[04:51] <holstein> timaaa: no root partition.. i would just clear out some empty space, and let the installer do the work automatically
[04:51] <holstein> otherwise, you need a partition specified as root, as / ...and you'll want a swap file
[04:52] <timaaa> So what do i do.
[04:52] <timaaa> I have a 200 gig partion do i set it to use that?
[04:52] <holstein> timaaa: depends really.. i suggest, clearing out some free space and letting the installer do it automatically
[04:53] <holstein> if you want the entire 200 for xubuntu, then just choose "use entire drive" or "replace existing OS"
[04:53] <timaaa> I want to keep windows too.
[04:55] <holstein> timaaa: there is an "install alongside windows" option
[04:56] <holstein> i would have my data backed up, and i usually use a live CD and shrink the windows partition, reclaiming some empty space, as i suggested above.... then i let the installer use the empty spcae
[04:56] <holstein> space*
[04:57] <holstein> there are lots of guides and tips.. and different ways to do it... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
[04:57] <Cheri703> Juvenal: ok, bad news :( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2004216
[04:57] <Cheri703> looks like xfapplets won't work anymore -_-
[04:57] <Juvenal> ah, lame
[04:57] <timaaa> I have a full backup. So i have to go and configure the partion from windows.
[04:57] <Cheri703> I want world clock dangit!
[04:58] <holstein> timaaa: nope.. you dont have to, but you can,.. windows wont make you an ext4 partition
[04:58] <holstein> timaaa: what do i usually do? make *empty* space, and let the installer do it, automatically
[04:58] <Juvenal> Cheri703, indeed. i collaborate with people all over the world
[04:58] <Juvenal> world clock will be missed
[04:58] <Juvenal> rip
[05:00] <timaaa> Cause i have three partions.
[05:00] <timaaa> Windows, recovery, and windows info
[05:00] <Cheri703> Juvenal: ooo, I had an idea, give me a sec
[05:00] <Juvenal> timaaa, do you want to replace windows, or install along side windows?
[05:01] <holstein> timaaa: its up to you.. i usually simplify, and shrink one
[05:01] <timaaa> Alongside
[05:01] <holstein> Juvenal: dual boot
[05:01] <holstein> timaaa: that page i linked lays out the options pretty well
[05:01] <Juvenal> timaaa, then boot the livecd, use gparted to shrink the partition and install on free space
[05:02] <wadapdoc> hansin I got good and bad news
[05:02] <holstein> timaaa: i think you are trying to create a linux install partition from windows, and windows wont do that (not easily, nor by default)
[05:02] <Cheri703> Ok Juvenal, on your panel, add a "launcher" then from that, add "orage globaltime" then you can set it up. not nearly as easy as the other one, but it'll get you a clickable worldtime thing. will keep poking around
[05:02] <wadapdoc> I got a fresh install and even logged into Xubuntu but after that the system start crashing showing crash reports and froze
[05:03] <hansin> wadapdoc: Good news it installed and booted, bad new after 10 minutes the hard drive started smoking and burst into flames ;)
[05:03] <Cheri703> or you could just have multiple orage clocks with the various time zones :)
[05:03] <wadapdoc> haha not exactlly but it sounded like it was strugling to pass some bad sectors and few errors showed up
[05:04] <hansin> wadapdoc: You used the regular Xubuntu 12.10 release for  LivdCD right? 23 or 64 bit? I don't think it really matter. My guess is that based on the fact that Windows started locking up the way it did, you may have a drive that has seen better days.
[05:04] <wadapdoc> It was something about I/O error, dev sda, sector 588391 and 563176
[05:04] <hansin> Just a guess, but sounds like it. Are you booted from drive or USB right now?
[05:04] <wadapdoc> yes
[05:05] <wadapdoc> It sounds to me as the HDD can't get past the bad sectors
[05:05] <hansin> Just for the fun of it, can you post output from fdisk -l to pastebin again and post link?
[05:05] <wadapdoc> sure
[05:05] <hansin> Just want to see if the Nvidia entries disappeared.
[05:05] <timaaa> Im firing up windows and will resize the windows partion.
[05:06] <holstein> timaaa: you dont use windows for that, though you can.. you can use the ubuntu installer, or gparted from a live CD
[05:06] <Juvenal> Cheri703, nice, ill give that a look
[05:07] <wadapdoc> hansin when I write the fdisk command now nothing happens
[05:07] <holstein> wadapdoc: you trying to recover some data from a dying disk? i use photorec from testdisk
[05:07] <Cheri703> grr, trying to figure out how to make it display in HH:MM am/pm 12 hr clock instead of HH:MM 24 hr clock
[05:07] <hansin> try 'sudo fdisk -l' and then it will ask for your password. This because in HD boot you are not root like in UDB boot.
[05:07] <wadapdoc> nah I got the data recovered I'm trying to run a checkdisk and fix the errors on the hard
[05:08] <Unit193> Cheri703: man strftime  has all the choices.
[05:08] <Cheri703> well, the normal panel clock is fine
[05:08] <Cheri703> but orage globaltime is different
[05:08] <Cheri703> -_-
[05:08] <holstein> wadapdoc: errors, or bad sectors?
[05:08] <wadapdoc> I think both
[05:08] <dancat> Juvenal: by chance, do you know of a better forum to ask media related questions?
[05:08] <holstein> wadapdoc: i would trash it.. you can trust them after they start loosing a bunch of sectors
[05:09] <hansin> personally, I'd just replace the drive since it is a clean boot, but only because I don't know how to get good use out of a drive with bad sectors and all that. Okay, yeah, what holstein said...
[05:09] <Juvenal> dancat, i would ask on the gmediawhatever forum
[05:09] <hansin> I mean clean install.
[05:09] <Juvenal> since the issue is with their application
[05:09] <holstein> dancat: what media? audio? #opensourcemusicians #ubuntustudio
[05:10] <Cheri703> Juvenal: WAIT! There might be a way
[05:10] <Cheri703> hang on
[05:10] <dancat> audio specifically the tagging of AAC and differences between it and id3 and how it effects media programs like gmusicplayer
[05:10] <dancat> thanks juvenal
[05:11] <timaaa> So i just cleared 84 gigs free space
[05:11] <holstein> dancat: i would just edit the tags, and test
[05:11] <dancat> okay
[05:11] <wadapdoc> here it is hansin http://pastebin.com/H2TZ4REc
[05:11] <Cheri703> \o/ I found it I think!
[05:11] <holstein> dancat: i wouldnt trust anything i read or see or that anyone says anyways... i would want to see it
[05:12] <holstein> dancat: its easy to run a few files through there and see first-hand
[05:12] <Cheri703> Juvenal: add the orage clock, then at the far right next to "line 1" and the font setting, click the down arrow, it'll give an "add" option
[05:12] <Cheri703> then you can add more I *think*
[05:12] <Cheri703> maybe?
[05:12] <wadapdoc> I think if I run something like chkdsk that will fix errors and bad sectors this sick little baby might walk again.
[05:12] <Cheri703> wait...ok, nvm >_<
[05:13] <holstein> wadapdoc: nope.. bad sectors are just that... bad.. they can be remapped to a certain degree, but if its failing, its failing
[05:13] <dancat> holstein: is there a reason why adding a id3 tag to an AAC m4a should damage it?
[05:13] <Cheri703> bah, you can add more lines, but not other timezones -_-
[05:13] <holstein> wadapdoc: i would get a diagnostic live CD such as the ulitmate boot cd and run a test that takes more than an hour or so
[05:13] <holstein> dancat: i keep backups, so not for me
[05:13] <wadapdoc> I don't have a DVD rom
[05:13] <holstein> dancat: the tag shouldnt effect the file in that way.. its just  a tag
[05:14] <holstein> or should be...
[05:14] <dancat> ok
[05:14] <hansin> wadapdoc: weird, you still have all the /dev/mapper/nvidia entries, but seems like it booted. I would agree that a new drive would be smart, but maybe do the diagnostics for fun and learn something new and just know for sure.
[05:14] <wadapdoc> Yeah.
[05:14] <dancat> holstein: thanks
[05:14] <holstein> wadapdoc: ?.. live USB.. or a tool from something else
[05:14] <wadapdoc> I got a working laptop next to me
[05:15] <wadapdoc> I'll try to find some software that is alternative to SpinRite
[05:15] <wadapdoc> and try something like a HDD recovery
[05:15] <holstein> wadapdoc: thats why i suggested the ultimate boot cd
[05:15] <wadapdoc> im gonna look into it
[05:16] <holstein> thats my go to live diagnostic.. but you can install something somewhere else.. you just *dont* want to work from that drive while trying to fix it
[05:16] <holstein> thats why i suggested a live CD.. or USB or whatever you have accesss to.. pull it out and put it in the work machine if you want
[05:16] <holstein> you wont fix/scan that drive in any way i would trust while booting an OS from it
[05:17] <wadapdoc> it's such a weird thing
[05:17] <holstein> best case, you force an fsck on reboot and it just automagically fixes it.. but if it has a lot bad sectors, that will just get worse and worse with use
[05:17] <wadapdoc> I never had a harddisk die on me
[05:17] <holstein> wadapdoc: its not really.. *all* hard drives fail
[05:17] <wadapdoc> but had several video cards
[05:18] <hansin> holstein: do you like the ultimate boot CD? I just discovered it because I converted an old Win98 drive to a virtual image that had GRUB installed and I needed to repair the MBR to Win (because converted just the Win partition to virtual image.) Seemed cool.
[05:18] <Cheri703> Juvenal: sorry about all of the rambling, looks like adding a launcher for orage globaltime will be the easiest answer as far as I can tell
[05:19] <holstein> hansin: works for me.. has the vendor tools in there.. its small... fast.. we should discuss in the OT channel though
[05:19] <Juvenal> Cheri703, ok. thanks
[05:20] <hansin> holstein: Okay, well I can explore it more, that is all I was wondering. True, not really Xubuntu. Just glad to see it mentioned so maybe I'll keep a 'physically' copy around, not just mount iso in a VM.
[05:21] <Riberty> what is the keyboard shortcut for minimizing windows?
[05:22] <hansin> wadapdoc: Good night and good luck! Seems you are making progress.
[05:23] <holstein> Riberty: try alt+f9 real quick
[05:23] <hansin> holstein: Thanks for info just listening in. Goodnight (or day) as well.
[05:23] <holstein> hansin: cheers!
[05:23] <Riberty> holstein: it doesnt work. im on xfce
[05:24] <holstein> Riberty: did you browse the shortcuts?
[05:24] <Riberty> yeah it says alt+f9
[05:25] <Riberty> doesnt work tho
[05:25] <holstein> Riberty: doesn anything alt work? doesn alt+4f close?
[05:25] <holstein> open something else, and test alt+f4
[05:25] <Riberty> that works
[05:25] <holstein> Riberty: i would just put it in again, and test
[05:25] <Riberty> i think its cause i installed gala
[05:26] <Riberty> or pantheon
[05:26] <holstein> Riberty: could be.. if you broke it, it might be broken
[05:26] <holstein> Riberty: you can try as a different user, or test with the live CD to make sure its working with your hardware
[05:27] <holstein> i would just add it back in to the shortcuts and try it again
[05:27] <timaaa> Holstein, how do you shrink a partion?
[05:27] <timaaa> From command line
[05:27] <timaaa> ?
[05:28] <holstein> timaaa: i dont
[05:28] <holstein> timaaa: i boot a live CD, and use gparted
[05:29] <holstein> timaaa: OR, i just do it from the installers partitioner
[05:37] <timaaa> Okay i have the xbuntu on a flash drive is that enough?
[05:39] <timaaa> Holstien, ^
[05:40] <holstein> timaaa: ?
[05:40] <holstein> timaaa: you can use tab complete.. you type "hol" and hit tab
[05:40] <holstein> timaaa: enough for what?
[05:41] <timaaa> To do everything i need to
[05:41] <timaaa> For a dual boot
[05:41] <holstein> timaaa: depends on what you want to do
[05:41] <holstein> timaaa: can i setup dual boot with a xubuntu live CD? sure
[05:42] <holstein> timaaa: i would do it much like that link i gave you... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBoot
[05:47] <Juvenal> ^me
[05:47] <Juvenal> starting to get things installed :P
[05:47] <Cheri703> yay Juvenal :) I just got my panels sorted since the way I originally wanted to do it isn't possible
[05:48] <Cheri703> fun note Juvenal: if you have a panel on each monitor, you can make the window buttons only display open apps from that monitor, which is handy for my use
[05:49] <JewVanEl> http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-01272013-124756am.php
[05:50] <JewVanEl> this looks much cleaner than gnome
[05:50] <Cheri703> nice!
[05:50]  * Cheri703 tries to get s screenshot
[05:50] <JewVanEl> idk what that zimagez thing is
[05:51] <JewVanEl> but it was the option when i prtscn's
[05:54] <Cheri703> http://ubuntuone.com/54emKVVJomjrRiOLwDG7Go
[05:55] <Cheri703> I like my dark themes :D
[05:55] <JewVanEl> since when does netflix support linux?
[05:56] <Cheri703> :D it doesn't, someone band-aid-ed a thing together and it works pretty well
[05:56] <JewVanEl> lmao, nice
[05:56] <Cheri703> http://doctormo.org/2012/11/19/netflix-on-ubuntu-try-this-ppa/
[05:56] <JewVanEl> ill have to play with xfce themes
[05:57] <JewVanEl> i like dark too
[05:57] <Cheri703> I have the quassel dark theme, http://www.webupd8.org/2012/12/2-beautiful-dark-themes-for-gtk-36-or.html the delorean dark, and I'm running a chrome extension called "hacker vision" that inverts webpages :D
[05:58] <Cheri703> my eyes are really sensitive to light, and even on 15% brightness, staring at a page of black on white all day was giving me headaches from eye strain
[05:58] <Cheri703> (I work from home full-time)
[05:59] <JewVanEl> ah, so its just firefox in wine lol
[05:59] <JewVanEl> kinda figured as much
[05:59] <Cheri703> heh, yeah, with some custom stuff sorted out
[05:59] <Cheri703> apparently
[05:59] <holstein> its more that just FF though... a few other key tweaks
[06:02] <JewVanEl> mmm, hacker vision
[06:02] <JewVanEl> i like this
[06:02] <Cheri703> yus
[06:02] <Cheri703> if you combine it with "change colors" it helps on sites that were dark or colored to start with. You can create a standard point for it to work from (if that makes sense?)
[06:03] <Cheri703> I can show examples, I took screenshots trying to explain this to someone else last night :)
[06:04] <JewVanEl> i think ill figure it out :)
[06:04] <Cheri703> happy eyeeeees
[06:13] <donnie> True or False. I read that if I want to get rid of Thunderbird. If and when it asks to remove xubuntu-desktop. That, that is perfectly safe without ruining the distro, or having to fix anything.
[06:14] <Cheri703> you can just remove thunderbird, it doesn't (or at least didn't for me) ask to remove xubuntu-desktop
[06:16] <Unit193> donnie: If it were to ask you, it'd be fine.  As it is a recommends of the package, don't think it'd ask though.
[06:17] <donnie> Ok. So I am safe just incase? Because I am on xubuntu
[06:17] <JewVanEl> it will only ask if there is nothing else that depends on it
[06:17] <Unit193> xubuntu-desktop is a metapackage, it's fine if uninstalling something removes that as well.
[06:18] <donnie> Ok thank you.
[07:57] <Linuxland> can i remove a gnome shell?

[10:06] <nicholosophy> hey guys
[10:07] <nicholosophy> I'm having some issues with my xfce indicator plugin stuff
[10:07] <nicholosophy> some of the items are just a black box with a red crossed out circle
[10:07] <nicholosophy> but sometimes they come up ok
[10:07] <nicholosophy> is it something I can fix through configuration or is it just going to be hit and miss?
[10:31] <c2tarun> in xfce-look.org there are many themes without zoom option in there screenshots. I click on the images and they don't zoom out.
[10:37] <difo> hello :)
[10:37] <c2tarun> difo, hello
[10:38] <difo> is there anyone who can i ask for php and mysql app running like xamp on windows
[10:38] <c2tarun> difo, I think you are in wrong channel. Try #php
[10:39] <difo> thanks
[10:39] <difo> must be invited to join there
[10:39] <difo> :(
[10:40] <c2tarun> what??
[10:40] <c2tarun> difo, try ##PHP
[10:40] <difo> is there is any default "root" password in xubuntu?
[10:41] <c2tarun> difo, root password for what?
[10:41] <difo> to install mysql
[10:42] <difo> [12:39] == #php Cannot join channel (+i) - you must be invited [12:40] == ##PHP Cannot join channel (+r) - you need to be identified with services
[10:42] <nicholosophy> the root password for mysql is not the system root password
[10:42] <nicholosophy> you should set it to something secure
[10:42] <nicholosophy> difo, register with services then (type /ns help
[10:42] <difo> so is there default root password?
[10:42] <nicholosophy> I just answered your question
[10:43] <difo> im just installing xubuntu
[10:43] <difo> and its not asking me for the root pass
[10:43] <difo> only userpass
[10:43] <difo> u know
[10:44] <nicholosophy> mysql does not need your root password to install
[10:44] <c2tarun> difo, Xubuntus password is not same as mysql password
[10:44] <nicholosophy> mysql will ask you to set the mysql root password, which is different
[10:46] <c2tarun> nicholosophy, BTW do you have any idea how to change the image of close button in my current theme?
[10:47] <nicholosophy> c2tarun, no idea, sorry
[10:51] <tion_> how do i get res over 640x480 after installing nvidia drver?

[14:06] <akafakir> Hi guys, I've installed xubuntu-desktop over ubuntu. It runs fine, but I have a little inconsistency between the themes in different application. In some menu's are gray, and in some they're still dark like it was in ubuntu. Here is the screenshot: http://storage1.static.itmages.com/i/13/0127/h_1359295469_2259154_f9b180137d.png
[14:06] <akafakir> How can I fix it?
[14:07] <Os_Maleus1> Hi guys!
[14:10] <Os_Maleus1> I am running xubuntu 12.04.1 3.2.0-36-generic-pae running on this machine. yesterday, I was taking with my router to the working place. since that, I am not able to log on on that anymore. with other machines, it is no problem - may it effect Win7 or Xubuntu.
[14:10] <Os_Maleus1> can You give me a proposal, how to deal with this?
[14:44] <genoobie> morning all
[14:44] <genoobie> I am having trouble with my xubuntu install
[14:48] <esie> <genoobie> whats happen?
[14:49] <genoobie> well
[14:49] <genoobie> I am sort of compulsive about certain things
[14:49] <genoobie> I am now using the livecd to modify the partition table
[14:49] <genoobie> because for some reason, the installed starts at /sda5
[14:50] <genoobie> but there is only sda1 with something installed on it
[14:51] <genoobie> I think my etc/fstab must be a bit screwed up
[14:51] <River> s
[14:56] <genoobie> holy crap, using a live-cd on an old machine sucks
[15:40] <genoobie> the xubuntu installer is confusing
[15:40] <genoobie> I know it should be simpler
[15:40] <torax> what about it is confusing?
[15:41] <genoobie> well the partitioning tool is asking for things that I'm not really sure about
[15:41] <genoobie> I have three partitions
[15:42] <genoobie> sda1 is for an xp install, ntfs
[15:42] <genoobie> sda2 is 1GB swap
[15:42] <genoobie> sd3 is ext4 and I want to install xubuntu there
[15:42] <genoobie> although, i am not sure why swap needs its own partition
[15:42] <genoobie> is that "normal"?
[15:43] <torax> It is
[15:43] <genoobie> when I try to install xubuntu on /sda3 it mentions something about no root filesystem defined
[15:43] <genoobie> I'd rather have it installed on sda2
[15:43] <genoobie> and have sda3 as the swap
[15:44] <genoobie> the installer's "install besides xp" is confusing, there's a slide, but I'm not really sure what the slider is adjusting
[15:44] <genoobie> so I'll probably boot to the live-cd swap the partitions
[15:44] <torax> it adjust the space left for xp and space for xubuntu
[15:44] <genoobie> i.e. make sda2 an ext4 and sda3 a swap
[15:45] <genoobie> but when I get to the install screen its asking for a root filesystem to be defined
[15:45] <genoobie> is that just formatting?
[15:47] <torax> you choose the partition where you like to install xubuntu, that is the root, and you can format it as ext2,3,4. I suggest using ext4 in normal use
[15:47] <genoobie> I know this is compulsive, but I'd rather have the OS on sda2
[15:48] <genoobie> should I not care?
[15:48] <torax> I dont know if that matters, but you can do that way also
[15:49] <genoobie> okay, I will put this on "sda3" then
[15:50] <genoobie> I am planning to use openbox most likely as the wm
[15:50] <genoobie> anyhow that doesn't really matter
[15:50] <genoobie> torax, are you still here?
[15:50] <torax> yes
[15:50] <genoobie> okay, so I am going to leave the partitions alone
[15:50] <torax> ok
[15:51] <genoobie> "/sda1 is for ntfs - xp, /sda2 is for swap, /sda3 for xubuntu
[15:51] <torax> looks good
[15:51] <genoobie> but here's the thing, when then installer says "install beside xp" or "do something else" I am going to pick "do something else"
[15:52] <genoobie> at this point is where I become a bit confused
[15:53] <torax> just a sec
[15:53] <genoobie> torax, ok
[15:55] <torax> ok, click the sda3, the xubuntu partition. then click change "uset as ext4" and "mount point /"
[15:56] <genoobie> tx!
[15:57] <genoobie> that's what I was looking for
[15:57] <torax> :)
[16:26] <bennett1> hi! anyone knows how to change the appearance of lightdm's login box?
[16:27] <bennett1> in special, I wanted to change the color that goes behind a selected text from blue to red
[16:28] <genoobie> no idea sorry
[16:28] <bennett1> ok :)
[16:35] <daswort> Hi, i upgraded from 12.04 to 12.10 and two different maschines. On one the xscreensaver loginwindow is black and the other is in xubuntus colors. I reinstalled xubuntu-artwork but that doesnt work. Any suggestions?
[16:41] <bullgard4> daswort: "doesn't work" is no precise statement. Please try to find a relevant error message in ~/.xsession-errors. Also, dmesg may have a hint.

[16:42] <daswort> bullgard4: sorry. i mean that the theming of the login window is black (xscreensaver).
[16:43] <xubuntu663> hi daswort
[16:44] <xubuntu663> hi bullgard4
[16:44] <xubuntu663> I am ruben
[16:45] <daswort> hi xubuntu663 this is not the offtopic channel. this one is just for support.

[16:46] <xubuntu663> thanks
[16:46] <xubuntu663> thank you
[16:47] <xubuntu663> Can I ask a question regarding grub?
[16:48] <daswort> bullgard4: any idea how to change the theming of xscreensaver windows?
[16:49] <xubuntu663> how to change the drive where grub is installed?, I wish it boots from the usb pendrive where I have installed xubuntu
[16:50] <xubuntu663> now (my error) it is installing on the hard drive
[16:53] <xubuntu663> did I was clear?
[16:53] <bullgard4> daswort:  With me, Xfce-menu > Settings > Screensaver > Screensaver Settings > Display Modes. (Often with me there appeears a message window too: "Warning! Apparently your XScreenSaver service for display does not run. Should it be started now? OK | Quit")
[16:58] <daswort> thats my problem: http://imgur.com/pbY5Ebf the theming is wrong
[17:00] <bullgard4> xubuntu663: I can recommend ou an article in German: http://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB_2/Reparatur
[17:00] <xubuntu663> ok
[17:01] <xubuntu663> thankyou I will take a look on it
[17:03] <bullgard4> daswort: All what I can see from http://imgur.com/pbY5Ebf is that you need to type your password.  Can you elaborate.
[17:08] <daswort> I want that xscreens. shows it windows in the colors of the xubuntu artwork, like it does if you make a fresh install.
[17:13] <bullgard4> daswort: Right. But at the moent you can only escape by keying in your password.
[17:13] <daswort> Thats not the point.
[17:13] <bullgard4> I see.
[17:14] <bullgard4> That's why I asked you to elaborate.
[17:17] <daswort> I just want the right color scheme for xscreensaver :(
[17:18] <Cheri703> daswort: did you see this?http://askubuntu.com/questions/85109/how-do-i-theme-the-xscreensaver-unlock-screen
[17:19] <daswort> thats what i want. but where can i get the file without starting a live cd?
[17:20] <Cheri703> I'd just create a file called .Xresources and copy/paste from that answer
[17:20] <Cheri703> because it says "create/amend the file"
[17:20] <Cheri703> so...you should just be able to make one
[17:20] <Cheri703> I believe
[17:21] <Cheri703> The final answer says they made custom colors "Following fossfreedom's example, I chose the following settings in a a newly created ~/.Xresources file, and I found the result quite attractive (a dark-background theme with gentle blues):"
[17:21] <daswort> yes, but i want the xubuntu 12.10 default one :)
[17:22] <Cheri703> I installed fresh for xubuntu 12.10
[17:22] <Cheri703> I do not have a .Xresources file
[17:22] <Cheri703> so....I don't know that you will have a "default" one
[17:22] <Cheri703> you can either leave it as is, or give it a config
[17:22] <daswort> weird. okay, thanks.
[17:23] <Cheri703> yeah, I dunno WHY it is like that, just...apparently it is
[17:23] <Cheri703> some other thing might have changed it in its config, thus the weird colors, so now you have to say "disregard that, use this one" ...apparently
[20:17] <unanything> Hello
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest33032
[20:18] <Guest33032> hi
[20:18] <unanything> i have a problem with installation from usb and from cd: the program hangs up when i click "next" (at second dialog).
[20:18] <Guest33032> do you need help
[20:19] <unanything> i read about this bug about 4 month ago. and nothing changed. yes. i want to know what to do
[20:20] <unanything> thanks.
[20:20] <Guest33032> take it out then reload
[20:24] <Guest33032> hello you there
[20:28] <unanything> i'm booting from livecd. how reloading can helps with bug of installation?
[20:29] <unanything> after choosing language and confirming third-party software. program hangs on "next" button
[20:29] <kgb> unanything: how did you make the USB, what version of Xubuntu?
[20:31] <kgb> if from windows, try both: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ and http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows
[20:33] <kgb> or if you can load the liveusb, try re-making it with the Startup Disk Creator
[20:48] <unanything> i used unetbootin for usb and k3b for cd
[20:49] <kgb> and you've tried, both 12.04 and 12.10?..
[20:50] <unanything> ох и глючный у вас дистр.
[20:50]  * kgb isn't russian :)
[20:50] <unanything> i tried 12.10
[20:50] <unanything> ok. i'll try 12.04
[20:50] <kgb> maybe 12.04 will install, you can always upgrade :s
[20:50] <unanything> )
[20:51] <kgb> just.. make sure that the disk is simple - like no left-over bootloader for windows, if dual booting
[20:51] <kgb> lots of things can mess the installer up.. don't make a partition, let it use blank space
[20:52] <unanything> dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb
[20:52] <unanything> making 1 partition with fdisk
[20:52] <kgb> no need
[20:52] <unanything> and mkfs.vfat -n label /dev/sdb1
[20:53] <unanything> unetbootin wants fat partition
[20:53] <kgb> the installer can do it
[20:53] <unanything> it is standard procedure
[20:53] <kgb> *for HDD
[20:53] <unanything> it's about usb
[20:55] <kgb> when mine messes up, i repair windows from the cd, delete the ubuntu partitions (at the end of the drive) and let the live usb use the empty space while keeping windows
[20:56] <kgb> *fixboot and fixmbr
[20:57] <unanything> thanks) but i don't have windows at all. i have gentoo and arch with custom grub2.0 on hdd
[20:57] <kgb> ok, so that may be where the problem lies
[20:58] <unanything> in my opinion the problem in Xubuntu install program. it's obviously
[21:00] <kgb> right, but you have 2 distros and install a third one - might take some work to get it to install..:)
[21:00] <kgb> *installing
[21:00] <drc> Of course, the xubuntu installer has never worked for any other thousands of uses before you, so it must be that.
[21:00] <drc> stupid people
[21:03] <unanything> problem occurs Before the installer start working  with the disks. where is the stupidity ?
[21:06] <kgb> no stupidity, perhaps just something that's not easy 2 do
[21:06] <unanything> 12.04 seems working
[21:07] <kgb> oh :-0 nice, lol
[21:07] <unanything> thanks for help!
[21:07] <kgb> :)
[21:07] <unanything> but you have a big bug there. look to the internet. everybody have the same problem...
[21:09] <kgb> upgrading to 12.10 will try to change grub as well i think, btw.
[21:10] <unanything> will see)

[22:18] <perlo> hello! i've been having trouble with upgrades on my asus eee, i'm not sure which upgrade because i haven't been able to pinpoint this, but i'm wondering if you know of anyone else having had this problem, and if you've found a solution?
[22:18] <perlo> what happens is that i'm prompted to reboot, and after it's rebooted, the blue flash screen runs through and then the screen goes black, but it appears xubuntu is running properly except for this. Ctrl-Alt-F1 switches to terminal and i can run commands. the only solution so far is to reinstall xubuntu, but having to do this every other day becomes a bit tiresome.
[22:19] <genoobie> hey all
[22:22] <perlo> hi :)
[22:22] <genoobie> ugh, i think i made a mistake to go with xubuntu vs lubuntu
[22:23] <genoobie> seems really slow on this older machine
[22:23] <genoobie> was wondering if there were some easy ways to improve performance
[22:24] <genoobie> I mean it is slower than xp
[22:24] <genoobie> and that really should not be...
[22:25] <genoobie> any tips?
[22:25] <knome> windows xp is from 2001, xubuntu 12.xx is from 2012.
[22:25] <knome> how much ram?
[22:26] <genoobie> little, 384, going to 512 in a few days
[22:26] <knome> 512 might be doable, but lubuntu might be better for you any way
[22:26] <genoobie> ok
[22:26] <genoobie> tx!
[22:27] <genoobie> if i changed wm or de would that make a diff?
[22:29] <genoobie> how can i check if the swap is being used?
[22:32] <genoobie> ok
[22:32] <genoobie> it says 360K of mem is being used
[22:32] <genoobie> how can I check what is using it...
[22:34] <genoobie> urgh
[22:41] <Boom_Farmer> How would I go about getting XFCE 4.10 in Xubuntu 12.04 ?
[22:42] <Boom_Farmer> Is it as simple as adding a ppa, apt-get update, then apt-get upgrade? http://it-diary.com/tutorials/install-xfce-4-10-in-ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin/
[23:02] <genoobie> is it normal for something like 120 processes to be running in the background?
[23:07] <Boom_Farmer> genoobie: I've got 141 with about 15 tabs of Chromium, Apache, MYSQL, some PDFs and some terminal stuff.
[23:08] <Boom_Farmer> 37 of those are system processes running as root.
[23:26] <saltmiser> so
[23:27] <saltmiser> realistically
[23:27] <saltmiser> what problems would I have on xubuntu that I wouldn't have on ubuntu?
[23:28] <Boom_Farmer> Well, the base system is the same. Any issues would be with the XFCE system, so the core apps, the window manager, the desktop.
[23:28] <Boom_Farmer> Not sure about the specifics.
[23:39] <Cheri703> I was using regular ubuntu and had been having weird glitches and issues, I was thinking it was my computer dying in some way. Switched to xubuntu, and at least since thursday have had NONE of the same issues.
[23:39] <Cheri703> so...for me the opposite.
