[00:18] <histo> sam555: I don't know where you were thinking it was too similiar that should not be an issue

[00:19] <ESphynx> well metacity looks like a nice WM

[00:33] <genoobie> looking for a stripped down distro that runs lightweight for a PIII 800MHz, and 384MB ram (laptop)
[00:33] <apos> xubuntu
[00:33] <shufflebot> Ben64: sudo -i dude ;p
[00:33] <genoobie> apos, xubuntu is a bit laggy...
[00:34] <apos> because you have 384 ram.
[00:34] <KI4RO> Is there a way to tell the software center onto which drive to install software?
[00:34] <Ben64> shufflebot: but then you used su
[00:34] <genoobie> right, but I was thinking just plain old, twm and a simplified de
[00:34] <histo> Pici: in his example puppet is x for user puppet

[00:34] <genoobie> I am running puppylinux and I'm not entirely unhappy with it
[00:34] <apos> your going to have to either use a very old distro from that era, or add a lil more ram
[00:35] <histo> Pici: ahh
[00:35] <genoobie> so apos if I bumped it up to 512MB (max) xubuntu might work nicely?
[00:35] <histo> shufflebot: puppet folder is only x for the user not the g
[00:35] <Ben64> genoobie: you could try lubuntu too
[00:36] <Ben64> not sure which is lighter
[00:36] <genoobie> ben64, I did but the video detect was borked....
[00:36] <genoobie> lubuntu
[00:36] <apos> genoobie,  yes. also it would be a good idea to adjust the "swappiness" so it wont use swap untill it absolutely has to
[00:36] <shufflebot> Ben64: yeah because I'm switching users
[00:36] <apos> lubuntu has more artwork
[00:36] <genoobie> apos more artwork than xubuntu?
[00:36] <apos> yes
[00:37] <genoobie> hmm...I have lubuntu installed on another laptop and it seems reasonable
[00:37] <genoobie> but that laptop is a dual core 1gb
[00:37] <genoobie> anyhow, apos, lubuntu, xubuntu anything more streamlined DE?
[00:37] <histo> Ben64: su = switch user
[00:37] <Ben64> histo: i know...
[00:38] <genoobie> okay, so suppose I go with lubuntu, I have a *nix that has some drivers
[00:38] <apos> no dm and just run in terminal?
[00:38] <apos> lubuntu is fine. just adjust the swapiness
[00:38] <genoobie> should I get a printout of vendors (lspci) before I install lubuntu so the drivers work ok?
[00:39] <apos> if xubuntu works, im sure lubuntu will work
[00:39] <genoobie> yeah, xubuntu didn't quite work b/c of b43 legacy driver for wireless

[00:48] <apos> use gksudo instead?
[00:49] <unsobill_> gksudo for what ?
[00:49] <histo> unsobill: I don't think you want to change your default telnet app. To do so you would update-alternatives --config telnet

[00:54] <unsobill_> u want tv ?
[00:55] <unsobill_> its basically lab farm
[00:55] <unsobill_> that has lots of devices to telnet to
[00:55] <unsobill_> u pick one - click open console to it and voila - terminal opens up with telnet connection to it
[00:55] <unsobill_> thats how it is on windows :(
[00:55] <histo> unsobill_: yeah with internet explorer maybe
[00:55] <unsobill_> nah with firefox and chrome
[00:56] <unsobill_> i suspect i has to do with this command :
[00:56] <unsobill_> telnet://xxx.xxx.xxx:xxx
[00:56] <unsobill_> basically ubuntu has no idea what to do with association "telnet://"
[00:56] <unsobill_> tghats my uneducated guess
[00:56] <histo> unsobill_: It's not that ubuntu doesn't but the browsers don't
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> unsobill, correction: the browsers don't know the connection.
[00:57] <unsobill_> should browser ask OS about associations then...
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> unsobill, ubuntu doesn't dictate a browser's interpretation of URL prefixes (telnet://, IRC:// etc.(
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> at least not afaikl
[00:57] <TheLordOfTime> file associations, maybe.  prefix associations, don't think so.

[00:58] <histo> unsobill_: Have you thought about installing an extension in chrome or firefox?
[00:58] <unsobill_> hmm
[00:58] <unsobill_> perhaps may work
[00:58] <histo> unsobill_: here's one froma  quick google search http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Internet/Google-Chrome-Extensions/Telnet-77530.shtml  Althought I would just look int he play store.
[00:59] <histo> unsobill_: also you could add hostnames for each ip.. Then just telnet whateverhostname   in a terminal
[00:59] <unsobill_> i guess i just use terminal manager if nothing else would work fine
[01:00] <unsobill_> no time for drilling
[01:00] <histo> unsobill_: I would look for an extension.
[01:00] <unsobill_> im on ubuntu - no luxury of simplicity :D

[01:08] <unsobill_> histo, telnet auto /usr/bin/telnet.netkit

[01:09] <histo> kitten_mittens: okay do you have more than one option for kernel?
[01:09] <unsobill_> i got that as promt - how can i change it to something that will work lol
[01:09] <histo> kitten_mittens: you can try booting an older one.
[01:09] <kitten_mittens> i dont know what a kennel is but i have ubuntu advanced options for ubuntu and system settup
[01:10] <histo> kitten_mittens: can you take a picture of the screen and paste it?

[01:11] <histo> unsobill_: I have no idea what you are talking about.  Just please use a addon for firefox or an extension in chrome.  There are many. That functionality is not built into linux versions of those browsers aparently.
[01:11] <histo> kitten_mittens: cell phone w/ camera?
=== qos|away is now known as qos
[01:12] <Ben64> unsobill: you should really google your problem, solution is the first link
[01:12] <histo> Ben64: You may want to tell him what you searched for?
[01:12] <kitten_mittens> theres only 3 options, 'ubuntu', 'advanced options for ubuntu' and 'system settup'
[01:13] <Ben64> "ubuntu open telnet url"
[01:13] <histo> lol
[01:13] <kitten_mittens> and e to edit commands and c for command line
[01:13] <Ben64> its not rocket surgery
[01:13] <histo> kitten_mittens: hold on one second i'm checking something on that.
[01:13] <Guest80061> Hi, I have a question about installing Ubuntu on USB w/ persistent file.  When you're doing updates/saving to folders under home folder/etc. does ubuntu automatically save it to the persistent file(casper-rw)?
[01:13] <histo> kitten_mittens: also what version of ubuntu did you install
[01:13] <kitten_mittens> 12.10
[01:13] <histo> Guest80061: yes
[01:14] <Ben64> did 12.10 change the grub menu?
[01:14] <Guest80061> Another question: How can I get my main hard drive to mount when it won't?
[01:15] <histo> kitten_mittens: do you not see something like this http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JkW4rtv2kGA/T2iNGdO6MLI/AAAAAAAADUY/0NlBNgwJJgQ/s1600/GRUB2-boot-menu.png
[01:15] <histo> Ben64: man friggen 12.10
[01:15] <Ben64> Guest80061: what do you mean "when it won't"
[01:15] <kitten_mittens> yeah but differnt options
[01:15] <ElixirVitae> Hi~
[01:15] <mangdood> What ways are there of changing GNOME 3 settings? I haven't installed it but I'd like to be able to change settings to my preference
[01:15] <histo> kitten_mittens: ahh they changed that in 12.10 select advanced options
[01:16] <kitten_mittens> and my grub is version 2.00-7ubuntu11
[01:16] <Guest80061> When I right click on it from the home folder and click mount I get an error message "unable to mount volume"
[01:16] <ElixirVitae> I was wondering whether setting up a new system from minimal CD and adding packages or deleting certain packages from a normal install have difference.
[01:16] <ElixirVitae> Does it?
[01:16] <histo> kitten_mittens: under advanced options you should be able to select an older kernel version
[01:16] <histo> ElixirVitae: yes gets rid of a lot of bloat
[01:17] <kitten_mittens> ok, theres versions 3.5.0-22 and 3.5.0-17 and both have a recovery option too
[01:17] <histo> ElixirVitae: you can completely customize what's installed
[01:17] <histo> kitten_mittens: slect 3.5.0-17  non-recovery
[01:17] <histo> kitten_mittens: see if the system boots without errors
[01:18] <kitten_mittens> it froze
[01:18] <ElixirVitae> Can't I get rid of the said bloat after install by hunting them down via synaptic?
[01:18] <kitten_mittens> it says loading linux 3.5.0-17-generic... then under it says loading initial ramdisk ... and its frozen
[01:19] <ElixirVitae> I meant normal install, btw.
[01:19] <histo> ElixirVitae: Yeah I guess just a longer way of doing it.
[01:20] <histo> ElixirVitae: like if you are going to just install ubuntu-desktop from a minimal install then there is no difference.
[01:20] <ElixirVitae> I wonder whether they will be more or less equivalent.
[01:20] <histo> ElixirVitae: if you are going to start with a cli system and work up then there would be. I'm sure you'd miss a bunch of stuff going backwards.
[01:20] <ElixirVitae> I sure won't install ubuntu-desktop :)
[01:21] <histo> ElixirVitae: Like what are you trying to accomplish in total?
[01:21] <ElixirVitae> Another question, do configs change between 32 and 64 bit systems?
[01:22] <histo> ElixirVitae: no
[01:22] <ElixirVitae> I want to get a leaner system, and learn more in the process, but wonder whether the hassle would be worth it.
[01:22] <ElixirVitae> If it doesn't give me much benefit, I'd rather install normal and delete some parts.
[01:22] <azbyin> hi all.. How do i ensure that *all* logged in users are able to read/write to a usb disk i have just plugged in?
[01:22] <kitten_mittens> :(
[01:23] <JokesOnYou77> Hi all, how do I start an ssh session and then background it?  (And then bring it back to foreground and/or end it when I want to get rid of it)
[01:23] <histo> ElixirVitae: You could always create a virtual machine and install a minimals system and work up.. Ex: install xorg  then whatever de you wanted.  You don't have to use a login manager for instance or you can pick a lighter one.
[01:23] <histo> kitten_mittens: what did it still lock up?
[01:23] <kitten_mittens> it says loading linux 3.5.0-17-generic... then under it says loading initial ramdisk ... and its frozen
[01:23] <histo> kitten_mittens: okay time to try recovery mode
[01:23] <ElixirVitae> Great, I should test it in VM, that way I can check whether my configs carry over seamlessly as well.
=== TheRainbowNight is now known as TheRainbowDawn
[01:24] <kitten_mittens> mm im just googling it first to see why its happening
[01:24] <ElixirVitae> Thanks histo, much appreciated.
[01:24] <histo> JokesOnYou77: ctlr+z    will dump you back to a prompt then type bg   to background
[01:24] <somsip> JokesOnYou77: use something like screen or tmux, if I understand what you need correctly
[01:24] <kitten_mittens> but my nets going super slow, wont load the pages -_-
[01:24] <histo> JokesOnYou77: fg will bring it back to fore ground.
[01:25] <histo> kitten_mittens: could be many things. Bad hardware or software... We hve to test.
[01:25] <kitten_mittens> its not hardware, i have a nevery expensive motherboard that tells me whenever somethings wrong hardware wise
[01:26] <JokesOnYou77> histo, ctrl+z doesn't seem to work with an ssh session
[01:27] <histo> kitten_mittens: I wouldn't rule it out. Since you are experiencing these wierd issues.  But you need to try booting to recovery mode.  It should dump you at a terminal.  Then we can see if all the updates installed properly.
[01:27] <histo> JokesOnYou77: hold up let me try
[01:27] <kitten_mittens> ok
[01:28] <histo> JokesOnYou77: I would use screen then.
[01:28] <histo> JokesOnYou77: I didn't even think that it would forward the ctrl+z to the remote session
[01:28] <histo> duh
=== Granis` is now known as Granis
[01:29] <histo> JokesOnYou77: if you want to use jobs ie ctrl+z you have to ~ then Ctrl+z
[01:29] <JokesOnYou77> histo, I figured it out.  I can just use & and then fg the job number it gives when I want to get it back :)
[01:30] <histo> JokesOnYou77: ~ is the escape character
[01:30] <histo> JokesOnYou77: http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/42365/how-do-i-background-an-ssh-session/42367#42367
[01:30] <histo> JokesOnYou77: although you still should checkout screen much more powerfull.
[01:30] <Ben64> yes, screen
[01:31] <JokesOnYou77> histo, thanks.  Yeah, my solution didn't quite seem to work, I could get the ssh session back just with fg but then something funky happened with the prompt
[01:32] <JokesOnYou77> And yes, I realize that screen is generally better but I'm using my GUI atm, and I don't like multiple gui terminal windows running AND screen
[01:32] <histo> JokesOnYou77: when you bring it back hit enter for the screen to redraw. But ~ then ctrl+z works here for me
[01:32] <kitten_mittens> histo im in the recovery menu, now what
[01:32] <histo> JokesOnYou77: What I use is screen on the remote machine.   So I can disconnect the ssh session. Then if I want to come back I just ssh back in and reattach the screen starting where I left off.
[01:33] <histo> kitten_mittens: No under Advanced options for Ubuntu boot one of the (reocover mode) kernels
[01:34] <unsobill> OH GOD FINALLY
[01:34] <unsobill> PUTTY SAVED ME
[01:34] <FloodBot1> unsobill: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[01:34] <kitten_mittens> histo i did, it have me a recovery menu
[01:34] <unsobill> spent 1 hour trying to get firefox to associate telnet or ssh links under ubuntu
[01:34] <unsobill> fuking hell
[01:34] <unsobill> putty FTW
[01:34] <JokesOnYou77> histo, ahhh yes, I see what you mean.  I'm actually starting an ssh session with a dynamically forwarded port to the remot host so I can use it as a SOCKS proxy from browsing on my local host.  I don't have anything to really DO on the remote machine, I just need the tunnel open
[01:35] <histo> JokesOnYou77: then use -N so you don't get a prompt
[01:35] <histo> kitten_mittens: what are your options?
[01:36] <kitten_mittens> resume normal boot, clean, dpkg, grub, network, root, system summery
[01:36] <kitten_mittens> im guessing root? it says drop to root shell promt
[01:36] <JokesOnYou77> histo, perfect! ty :)
[01:36] <histo> kitten_mittens: How is this computer connected to network?
[01:36] <kitten_mittens> wireless
[01:37] <histo> kitten_mittens: is there a netroot option?
[01:37] <JokesOnYou77> histo, w8, but that doesn't give me back my local prompt :/
[01:37] <ekristen> are their any web based repo management tools?
[01:37] <kitten_mittens> no
[01:37] <ekristen> also is there any way to run a repo mirror but be able to approve/disapprove packages before allowing servers to download them?
[01:37] <histo> kitten_mittens: what's under network?  Can you configure your network card. And then drop to root shell that would be the goal here. Sorry it's been awhile since i've been in there.
[01:38] <kitten_mittens> http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/images/fixsudoprecise03.jpg
[01:38] <ekristen> I'm looking to run several ubuntu servers internally in a production env, and want to control which packages get advertised for update

[01:40] <GoGetOperated> Hey
[01:41] <kitten_mittens> i just have a flashing underscore
[01:41] <GoGetOperated> ./Go~Get\.
[01:41] <histo> kitten_mittens: Do you still have a cd lying around that you can boot to?  It would be a lot easier than walking you through configuring a network in command line if you just booted that and we repaired from there.
[01:41] <kitten_mittens> ok, i dont have cd i have usb for my pc
[01:42] <histo> kitten_mittens: or usb. I can't remember what you staid you installed from?
[01:42] <kitten_mittens> because it has no cdrom
[01:42] <histo> kitten_mittens: yeah boot to the usb drive you installed from.
[01:42] <Brewski> I'm looking for a QR barcode scanner solution for Ubuntu. We're looking to scan QR codes into a web form instead of manually typing them, so a "keyboard wedge" would be preferred (like credit card readers).
[01:42] <GoGetOperated> What ar you trying to do
[01:42] <Brewski> I know the software is there, is there hardware compatibility for any USB scanners yet?
[01:42] <kitten_mittens> done histo
[01:43] <GoGetOperated> There is a thing called Google look for ith there
[01:43] <histo> kitten_mittens: I have to go but basically you are going to try. Booting from usb.  Setup your network so it gets online. Mount the hard drive where ubuntu is installed.  chroot /dev/sdx replace sdx with whatever your hdd is.  Then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade.

[02:06] <kitten_mittens> i guess nobodys helping today
[02:06] <ItsMe__> NewUbun,  how have u tried to install ? Did u tried this http://bit.ly/9VxNou ?
[02:06] <NewUbun> i really want to start typing in CAP
[02:06] <gmachine_24> kitten_mittens, I don't know. what happens when you do $sudo fdisk -l?
[02:06] <gmachine_24> kitten_mittens, forgive me if you have answered this already. I just got here.
[02:06] <kitten_mittens> it lists my /dev/sda drive
[02:07] <gmachine_24> kitten_mittens, well, ............. can you post the result in pastebin? It lists details........ and those are important
[02:07] <NewUbun> ItsMe: i downloaded it, changed it to .deb and installed it
[02:07] <NewUbun> but looks like it has a problem with my Java
[02:07] <kitten_mittens> the problem is when i turn on my pc, it freezes, so we tryed a differnt kennal thing in grub and it just locks up at loading initial ramdisk
[02:08] <NewUbun> how do i fix tat
[02:08] <ItsMe__> did u changet what to .deb ?
[02:08] <kitten_mittens> i got told to do this: Booting from usb.  Setup your network so it gets online. Mount the hard drive where ubuntu is installed.  chroot /dev/sdx replace sdx with whatever your hdd is.  Then sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
[02:08] <gmachine_24> kitten_mittens, did you try a command prompt and then do a filecheck?
[02:08] <kitten_mittens> i dont know how to do that
[02:09] <NewUbun> I changed the folder from rpm to deb
[02:09] <NewUbun> the zip folder i had downloaded was in rpm
[02:09] <gmachine_24> kitten_mittens, well............ if you get to the Grub splash screen . . . you can choose (usually) to go to a command line... there should be that option for every kernel version you have on your drive
[02:10] <kitten_mittens> yeah we tryed that
[02:10] <kitten_mittens> well we tryed a differnt kernal thing
[02:10] <gmachine_24> kitten_mittens, if not, if you have a live USB boot drive - or even a cd - you can boot into the live version and then to a file check from a terminal
[02:11] <kitten_mittens> thts what im doing now
[02:11] <NewUbun> its_me... you here?
[02:11] <NewUbun> anyone????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
[02:11] <ItsMe__> I'm searching NewUbun
[02:11] <gmachine_24> *do a file check from a terminal as in $cntrl+atl+t and then $sudo e2fsck -ef /dev/sda or whatever

[02:11] <NewUbun> ok
[02:12] <gmachine_24> NewUbun - how did you change the folder?

[02:14] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, did you just change your user name?
[02:14] <loren> I am looking for help with Archive Manager.  What channel is most likely to help?
[02:15] <kittenmittenz> no this is my pc on the live usb, the other is on my laptop, the  key on my pc keyboar oesnt work so i have to use a macro on my game pa which is annoying so i was using the laptop
[02:15] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, well, the instructions you received before don't make sense to me. Your /dev/sda drive is not formatted or partitioned so you can't mount it anywhere.
[02:15] <kittenmittenz> nooo\
[02:15] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, no what

[02:19] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, I think you probably have to use dd.
[02:20] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, I think you probably have to use "dd", the command, that is.
[02:20] <kitten_mittens> whats the dd?
[02:20] <NewUbun> nope
[02:20] <ItsMe__> nope what :D

[02:28] <pertinate_> I need some help, if you guys don't mind. :o
[02:28] <ItsMe__> ok
[02:28] <ItsMe__> :)
[02:28] <Guest33132> i just burnt the newest iso of ubuntu to a dvd to install it into my lapotop and it still wants to load up with my old ubuntu the i had a dvd for that is unsupported now. and the boot option is set to boot from dvd.
[02:28] <pertinate_> I'm in need of enabling my two extra buttons on my mouse: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/comfort-mouse-4500 this is the mouse I'm using.
[02:29] <Hamled> so I'm trying to configure a machine with two ethernet interfaces, both with static IPs. When I do an ifup -a it brings up both interfaces and sets a route for default using one interface, but I want it to use the other instead. I've added such a statement to the correct interface in /etc/network/interfaces but it's still just using the other  interface
[02:30] <Hamled> how can I figure out what is causing it to setup a route for default on one of the interfaces automatically?
[02:30] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, ok, try this
[02:31] <Guest33132> ?
[02:31] <kittenmittenz> ok
[02:31] <ItsMe__> Guest33132,  did u checked md5 ? And are u sure you wrote the iso correctly ? I think u can't see boot menu from dvd ?
[02:31] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, ok, try  $sudo badblocks -v /dev/sda
[02:32] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, ok, try  if you cannot do that, you might have to install the program e2fsprogs as in $sudo apt-get install e2fsprogs
[02:32] <Guest33132> im saying i changed the boot menu in the pc to boot from dvd first. would md5 been when burning or?
[02:33] <kittenmittenz> Checking blocks 0 to 250059095

[02:33] <NewUbun> <Its_me> u here
[02:33] <kittenmittenz> its not oing anything though..
[02:33] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, yes, that is the one
[02:34] <gmachine_24> do you just have a blinking curser?
[02:34] <ItsMe__> Guest33132,  u must use md5checksum programs to check iso file , search on google "ubuntu md5 check".

[02:34] <akar1m> hello guys
[02:34] <kittenmittenz> ya
[02:34] <akar1m> I want tou extend my screen
[02:34] <NewUbun> ItsMe__u ehre
[02:34] <akar1m> I am using ATI VGA card
[02:34] <ItsMe__> If it's correct, u should have burned iso file wrongly i guess.
[02:34] <akar1m> how can I do that ?
[02:35] <ItsMe__> NewUbun,  yeah but i must go :)
[02:35] <ItsMe__> did u try it ?
[02:35] <akar1m> in windows ctrl+p and click extend option
[02:35] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, at the end of the terminal line $ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ or on a blank line?
[02:35] <NewUbun> sorry guys I was trying to copy the nae
[02:35] <NewUbun> name
[02:35] <kittenmittenz> blank?
[02:35] <akar1m> I am using my laptop's screen as a second display
[02:35] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, if it says it's checking then it's checking
[02:35] <kittenmittenz> after rea onlytest: it just has a squar box
[02:35] <akar1m> I got HDMI output
[02:36] <NewUbun> yes but how do i  get to the file... I tried in terminal but could not find the .openproj file
[02:36] <evansch0> i need some help o.o
[02:36] <ItsMe__> don't use terminal, go to your home folder and press "ctrl+h"  then search ".openproj" folder and open the "run.conf" file, NewUbun
[02:37] <evansch0> i need to find out how to connect a device like a usb as a drive like c:\ or D:\
[02:37] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, it is checking. also, when you boot from a live install on a usb drive or cd/dvd there is a choice to do a hard drive check
[02:38] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, that is one of your options.
[02:38] <NewUbun> i used the cd / then cd home and then cd newubun but after that when i tried ls i did not get any file by the name .openproj
[02:38] <kittenmittenz> ill o that next
[02:39] <NewUbun> ok
[02:39] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, and............ if you don't like any of those......... you can do $sudo touch /forcefsck which will force the computer to do a hard drive check on your next reboot
[02:39] <evansch0> so does anyone know how to connect a usb as a main drive
[02:39] <gmachine_24> evansch0, as in you want to boot from it or what
[02:39] <NewUbun> found it
[02:39] <NewUbun> 1 sec
[02:39] <ItsMe__> ok
[02:40] <evansch0> no i want it to be used instead of my hard drive
[02:40] <usr13> evansch0: You mean to set a static mount point?
[02:40] <evansch0> no idea
[02:40] <evansch0> :/
[02:40] <gmachine_24> evansch0, is your os going to be on this drive?
[02:40] <usr13> evansch0: You want to move your /home/directory to it?
[02:40] <evansch0> yes
[02:40] <evansch0> i think
[02:40] <gmachine_24> lol
[02:40] <gmachine_24> yes, to which question
[02:41] <gmachine_24> or both
[02:41] <NewUbun> should i cane it to ""-Djava.vendor = Sun-Xms128m-Xmx768m"
[02:41] <NewUbun> or just Sun-Xms....
[02:41] <evansch0> ok first let me tell you some background on my laptop
[02:41] <evansch0> its an hp 4410t
[02:41] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, depending on your cpu speed and etc. that disk check will take awhile
[02:41] <ItsMe__> -Djava.vendor = Sun-Xms128m-Xmx768m" , it must be this
[02:42] <evansch0> 2 gb on the hard drive xD

[02:44] <evansch0> and i want to use my sata drive and my usb drive

[02:44] <usr13> evansch0: It would be easier to just create a mount point for a particular subdirectory.
[02:44] <ItsMe__> NewUbun,  any result
[02:44] <ItsMe__> ?
[02:44] <evansch0> and i do that how
[02:44] <kittenmittenz> i wish it ha a progress bar
[02:45] <usr13> evansch0: Well, you can, (use the sata and usb drive together), I'm just trying to determine the best way.
[02:45] <Dmnchild> Hey all, can someone help me understand setquota? I am trying to set a users diskspace to 100gb. see the usage help, but still not working for me.
[02:45] <NewUbun> noting i did not get the msg again but the program did not start either
[02:45] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, well........ if you want to see if it's running do $cntrl+alt+t to open a terminal, type $top at the command line and the process should be listed at the top, using most of the cpu
[02:46] <usr13> evansch0: You have to create a mount point for it and then, (if you're going use your /home/dir for it), move /home/evansch0 to it.
[02:46] <evansch0> mount point?
[02:46] <gmachine_24> kittenmittenz, not most of the cpu, but it will be the process using the most
[02:46] <gmachine_24> cpu cycles
[02:46] <NewUbun> is there a way to uninstall open proj and reinstall it
[02:46] <usr13> evansch0: yes mount point.
[02:46] <NewUbun> to see if tere is a problem there
[02:46] <evansch0> what is a mount point
[02:47] <ItsMe__> new ubun i guess u didn't change correctlye.  JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.vendor=Sun -Xms128m -Xmx768m"
[02:47] <ItsMe__> it must be like this
=== brandon is now known as Guest14690
[02:47] <usr13> evansch0: a mount point is just a directory where files are stored.  /home/evansch0  if it is on another drive is called a "mount point".
[02:47] <evansch0> well i dont have ubuntu installed yet
[02:47] <ItsMe__> can u copy the line that u changed ?
[02:47] <NewUbun> ok let mme try again.. i will copy paste what you typed here
[02:47] <evansch0> that is why i need to use then together
[02:47] <evansch0> *them
[02:48] <usr13> evansch0: But this new location must have an entry for it in the /etc/fstab file. We can show you how.
[02:48] <evansch0> where can you show me
[02:49] <usr13> evansch0: Oh, you havent' done the install yet.  Well, just have the drive plugged in when you do the installed, and designate it as the mount point for /home
[02:49] <NewUbun> thanks it worked this time
[02:49] <NewUbun> thatnks alot
[02:49] <ItsMe__> you're welcome :) I must go, have a nice day :)
[02:49] <usr13> *install*  not installed
[02:49] <evansch0> then i guess i should change the boot device
[02:49] <NewUbun> Thank you Its_Me__
[02:50] <usr13> evansch0: Change the boot device?
[02:50] <NewUbun> you too
[02:50] <usr13> evansch0: No, we're not talking about the boot device here.
[02:50] <evansch0> yes the boot device right now boot device is usb then optical drive then so on

[02:51] <usr13> evansch0: So you are NOW saying that you want to do the entire Ubuntu install on the USB device?
[02:51] <evansch0> i should change it from usb to optical drive xD
[02:51] <evansch0> no both devices if possible
[02:51] <usr13> evansch0: (That's ok, we just need to know what it is you really want to do.)
[02:51] <usr13> evansch0: You dan do it on both devices, yes.

[02:59] <losticeberg> on 12.04 thats what it ses about my wireless card
[02:59] <usr13> losticeberg: Open a terminal window, type   lspci   hit Enter and see what it says about the wireless card.  Show us that line here.
[03:00] <evansch0> so usr if i use a external hard drive would i be able to boot from that
[03:00] <losticeberg> yes one ethernet

[03:00] <evansch0> usr13: if i use a external hard drive would i be able to boot from that
[03:00] <usr13> losticeberg: Is the ethernet card working?
[03:00] <usr13> evansch0: Yes, if your computer will boot to it.
[03:00] <losticeberg> not sure no way to hook up to test
[03:01] <evansch0> usr13: i think it will since it booted from a usb one before
[03:01] <usr13> evansch0: If your computer is capable of booting to USB, then yes, you can do the complete Ubuntu install on it.
[03:01] <usr13> evansch0: How big is it?
[03:01] <gmachine_24> losticeberg, for example, $sudo lspci has this as my bottom line "03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 02)"

[03:04] <usr13> evansch0: Your USB drive.
[03:04] <evansch0> usr13: oh well its only 4 gb xD
[03:04] <dr_willis> arp-: it's   amdccc  or somthing like that

[03:09] <gmachine_24> evansch0, I do not know

[03:09] <evansch0> thats weird xD
[03:09] <OerHeks> filantropus, "machine check exception" sounds like a hardwarefailure
[03:09] <usr13> filantropus: Ask a question, if someone knows the answer they will say so.
[03:10] <ahmedipa> I have problem with network manager
[03:10] <ahmedipa> gnome
[03:10] <filantropus> and how can i know what kind of hardware fail is?
[03:10] <usr13> ahmedipa: What problem?
[03:10] <ahmedipa> I removed it by mistake
[03:10] <usr13> filantropus: "fail"?
[03:10] <usr13> ahmedipa: You can re-install it.
[03:10] <filantropus> yes.
[03:10] <gmachine_24> mce result when cpu determines there is a hardware error
[03:10] <usr13> ahmedipa:  Are you connected to the internet right now?
[03:11] <evansch0> usr13, gmachine_24, thank you for your help :D
[03:11] <filantropus> my pc says:
[03:11] <ahmedipa> usr13: how
[03:11] <OerHeks> filantropus, depends on what bios maker, short-long beeps can tell
[03:11] <filantropus> "machine check exception"
[03:11] <usr13> ahmedipa: If so,  sudo apt-get install network-manager
[03:11] <ahmedipa> usr13: yes by usb
[03:11] <usr13> ahmedipa: sudo apt-get install network-manager
[03:11] <gmachine_24> evansch0, anytime

[03:13] <usr13> ahmedipa: Do you have a network cable plugged into your router?  Or are you using wireless?
[03:13] <kittenmittenz> is that ba gmachine?
[03:13] <gmachine_24> I've never seen anything use 211% of the cpu
[03:13] <kittenmittenz> lol
[03:13] <ahmedipa> usr13: I am using wireless by using my usb live
[03:13] <gmachine_24> that would seem impossible
[03:14] <gmachine_24> and the xorg cpu use is high
[03:14] <usr13> ahmedipa: iwconfig   #Tell us the name of the adapter.
[03:14] <OerHeks> 211%/400% 4-core
[03:14] <kittenmittenz> cpu isnt hot so.. i ont think its overclocking it
[03:14] <usr13> ahmedipa: Is it wlan0  ?   Or.... ____________?
[03:14] <gmachine_24> OerHeks, ahhhhhhhhh. thank you.
[03:14] <kittenmittenz> ohh.. i have an 8core
[03:14] <OerHeks>  1 zombie
[03:15] <ahmedipa> usr13: it is iwconfig
[03:15] <gmachine_24> Don't get personal.
[03:15] <ahmedipa> sorry
[03:15] <ahmedipa> wlan0
[03:15] <kittenmittenz> personal?
[03:15] <usr13> ahmedipa: Open a terminal, type   iwconfig  Hit Enter.  See what it says.  (Tell  us the name of the wireless device, something like wlan0 ).
[03:15] <gmachine_24> nevermind. a bad joke. :)
[03:15] <ahmedipa> yes it is wlan0
[03:16] <kittenmittenz> ammit, youtube stoppe working.. i hate live usb
[03:16] <ahmedipa> usr13: it is wlan0
[03:16] <usr13> ahmedipa: Ok,  do you know the essid of your wireless router?  If not, do   iwlist wlan0 scan
[03:16] <usr13> ahmedipa: What is the essid? ____________?
[03:17] <st0b> Hey guys. I'm a long time 10.04 user migrating to 12.04. I've had a lot of trouble on a fresh install of 12.04 with my wireless connection slowing to a halt. I've even used different NIC's with the same result
[03:17] <st0b> I've never had any issue similar in 10.04
[03:17] <ahmedipa> usr13: do you mean my network yes I know
[03:18] <usr13> ahmedipa: Yes, network name
[03:18] <ahmedipa> usr13: I found the name of ESSID:
[03:19] <usr13> ahmedipa: network name =  ESSID
[03:19] <ahmedipa> usr13: yeb
[03:19] <usr13> ahmedipa: Does your wireless router use encryption?
[03:19] <ahmedipa> yes
[03:19] <loren> First time on XChat.  How do I send output from terminal to this channel?
[03:19] <ahmedipa> usr13: yes
[03:19] <usr13> ahmedipa: What type? WEP?
[03:20] <ahmedipa> usr13: I don't remember
[03:20] <st0b> loren, post in pastebin and then the link here
[03:20] <usr13> ahmedipa: Ok, can't help you.  YOu will need to get an ethernet cable long enough to reach the router and just plug it in.
[03:21] <ahmedipa> aha
[03:21] <usr13> ahmedipa: Or, login to the router and temporarily turn off encryption.
[03:21] <ahmedipa> usr13: sounds good
[03:22] <usr13> ahmedipa: If you have another computer that has an active connection to the router, you should be able to login to it and turn off encryption.
[03:22] <bencc> can I use selinux in ubuntu?
[03:22] <usr13> ahmedipa: Let us know when you have that done.
[03:23] <usr13> bencc: Yes
[03:23] <billytwowilly> can somebody point me to a repository with php 5.4.11 in it for quantal? the one I was using for precise doesn't have quantal packages and google has been no help...
[03:23] <usr13> bencc: sudo apt-get install selinux
[03:23] <OerHeks> !selinux
[03:23] <ubottu> SELinux is available on Ubuntu, but not officially supported. Ubuntu uses another security framework by default, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor
[03:23] <ahmedipa> I will back because I have another prplm
[03:24] <usr13> OerHeks: Thanks.
[03:24] <OerHeks> disable appamor first, i think
[03:24] <bencc> OerHeks: so it's not a good idea to use it?
[03:24] <mehwork> how can i iterate through gnome-terminal tabs with my keyboard?
[03:25] <bencc> OerHeks: I mean, if it's a security feature and it's not officially supported
[03:25] <usr13> bencc: As OerHeks points out, you are better off to use AppArmor, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AppArmor
[03:25] <st0b> I've been seeking help for my wifi dying after extended use. Restarting the network service seems to remedy the situation temporarily. I experience this on a fresh 12.04 install with multiple wireless NICs
[03:25] <ahmedipa> usr13:I will restart within 10 minute I think I will finish before
[03:26] <usr13> ahmedipa: Do you now have encryption turned off?
[03:26] <OerHeks> bencc,  i have no experience with selinux/ubuntu, i think it is a design choice
[03:27] <malkauns> in 12.10 how do i get empathy to remember my yahoo contacts?
[03:27] <kittenmittenz> i have a 250gb Vertex 4 SSD, is there compatibility issues with it on ubuntu?
[03:27] <mehwork> it seems weird to make security features something that can be disabled
[03:27] <usr13> malkauns: Aren't they on your yahoo web based interface?
[03:28] <usr13> malkauns: Or are you using a PC based email client?  If so, which one?
[03:28] <malkauns> usr13, yea but when i rename a contact in empathy it should remember it
[03:28] <mehwork> it's like giving someone a hard hat but not making them wear it
[03:29] <usr13> malkauns: You have a set of contacts in empathy?
[03:29] <malkauns> usr13, i'm using empathy which is a standalone Multi-IM client for linux
[03:29] <malkauns> usr13, yes
[03:29] <malkauns> usr13, but when i restart empathy it doesn't remember what i renamed my yahoo contacts to
[03:29] <usr13> malkauns: I do not know if mpathy will automatically upload new contact information to Yahoo, but I do not think it does.
[03:31] <usr13> malkauns: I figure it's better to just use the web-based email server.
[03:31] <usr13> malkauns: ... that way, you are not restricted to only using your home PC for email.
[03:32] <malkauns> usr13, erm, not the ideal solution when i use facebook-chat, google-talk and aim
[03:32] <Evansch0> hi
[03:33] <usr13> malkauns: I always thought that was what tabs were for.  (in the browser).
[03:33] <malkauns> usr13, i am aware the pro's and cons or using a web based interface but the problem is Empathy should remember the aliases i set
[03:33] <usr13> malkauns: Maybe it does, I dono
[03:34] <s5fs> Hey, if I've got a service that it started by dbus, and I kill it with 'kill', how do I re-start it? Is there  like a dbus-service-start or whatever?

[03:41] <Evansch0> mwahaha
[03:41] <ahmedipa> Wireless disconnects with ubuntu  12.04LTS
[03:41] <ahmedipa> this problem starts today
[03:41] <iManassah> anyone play with yamas?

[03:41] <iManassah> mitm for ubuntu
[03:41] <Evansch0> so i have 12.04 lts and im trying to figure out the password and username if the account times out
[03:42] <ahmedipa> thank you for helping me about the first problem
[03:42] <usr13> ahmedipa: Do you now have encryption turned off?
[03:42] <ahmedipa> usr13: my main problem wireless
[03:42] <iManassah> Evans...when your machine first boots up, choose to boot with recovery mode, or something like that
[03:42] <loren> Places in the archive manager does not show the windows share file, so I cannot direct the output to my home server.  Nautilus has no trouble locating the file and allowing me to read and write.
[03:42] <Evansch0> how
[03:42] <ahmedipa> how can I check this
[03:42] <iManassah> Evans:  that will take you to a root prompt, then just passwd (user) to change password
[03:43] <Evansch0> i dont have ubuntu installed
[03:43] <usr13> ahmedipa: Did you log into the router and turn encryption off?
[03:43] <Evansch0> xD
[03:43] <ahmedipa> usr13: I used wired
[03:43] <iManassah> what do you have Evans
[03:43] <Evansch0> a boot up disk
[03:43] <usr13> ahmedipa:  sudo apt-get install network-manager
[03:43] <ahmedipa> usr13: wired instead of wireless
[03:43] <Evansch0> for ubuntu 12.04 lts
[03:44] <iManassah> a boot up disk?
[03:44] <Evansch0> dvd
[03:44] <usr13> ahmedipa: Open a terminal, type:   sudo apt-get install network-manager   Hit Enter.

[03:45] <iManassah> sorry cat just walked across my keyboard
[03:45] <Evansch0> lol

[03:58] <zygoptera> antonio_ | pwd is a command that tells you what directory you are in
[03:58] <antonio_> ah
[03:59] <usr13> ahmedipa: Are you sure the passphrase is correct?
[03:59] <ahmedipa>  yes, if incorrect it will tell me
[04:00] <usr13> ahmedipa: If you can login to the router from another PC, you can either see what the password is, or change it.
[04:00] <antonio_> argh

[04:05] <d1rkp1tt> Hi all, I am running an ubuntu server minus desktop on low memory. Just wondering if anyone has a good resource on what can be safely trimmed from the system to get a very small footprint
=== Prodego is now known as lar
=== lar is now known as prodego
[04:05] <TheLordOfTime> d1rkp1tt, how low are we talking for memory?
[04:05] <usr13> loren: http://imagebin.org/244767
[04:05] <antonio_> when I try to install marketsamurai.air an xterm window opens up...and its not accepting my root password...dr_willis: any ideas?
[04:06] <loren> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587871/
[04:06] <zygoptera> ubuntu doesn't by default have a root password
[04:06] <slipp3d> so here is a wondering ... I have xubuntu installed and working fine .. .but any time I load up a site that has flash on it the computer locks up and the computer is completely unresponsive ... I have to hold the power button down to get it to let go ... any thoughts on that .....
=== prodego is now known as Prodego
[04:06] <usr13> antonio_: Use user password
[04:06] <antonio_> "this application requires administrative rights to run"
[04:07] <antonio_> usr13: its not working
[04:07] <slipp3d> I have tried different browsers ... but it does not matter ...
[04:07] <usr13> antonio_: what application is it?
[04:07] <zygoptera> slipp3d | flash itself is pretty buggy
[04:07] <antonio_> market samurai...
[04:07] <antonio_> its an adobe air application
[04:08] <blunted> Fdisk and parted cannot seem to find sda. However it is there and has 1&2 mounted, no raid no lvm
[04:08] <slipp3d> zygoptera, I realize that ... but that does not explain why it was working and now it does not
[04:08] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Ubuntu Server is already pretty thin. It doesn't come with a whole lot of extra stuff by default. But if you want, you can add anything from the repos...
[04:09] <antonio_> usr13: see this picture  the black window at the top is asking for my password
[04:09] <poz> hi
[04:09] <antonio_> http://i98.photobucket.com/albums/l269/con_movies/Screenshotfrom2013-01-29180713_zpse83f7774.png
[04:09] <antonio_> the problem is that its not accepting my password
[04:09] <d1rkp1tt> rob_b ... thanks. It was pretty good out of the box, until i did an apt-get upgrade
[04:09] <zygoptera> slipp3d | did you update your flash?
[04:10] <d1rkp1tt> rob_p the upgrade increased the footprint a bit
[04:10] <blunted> Where do disk and parted look for disk info?
[04:10] <slipp3d> zygoptera, installed from the software center
[04:10] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Shouldn't have though... upgrades simply replace older versions...
[04:10] <slipp3d> so i would guess that is the most current
[04:10] <antonio_> got it..I had to run sudo /usr/bin/Adobe\ AIR\ Application\ Installer
[04:10] <dr_willis> antonio_: run it as root.. better idea  dont use air at all...
[04:11] <zygoptera> slipp3d | was it  previous version that was working right?
[04:11] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: That's not to say that the newer versions aren't sometimes a little bigger... but not usually significantly.
[04:11] <antonio_> dr_willis: I have to run air for this program..no way around it
[04:11] <dr_willis> id find a differnt program then
[04:11] <slipp3d> 12.04 was working ... 12.10 is broken
[04:11] <antonio_> dr_willis: its the industry standard
[04:11] <dr_willis> air is basically dead on linuxx
[04:11] <d1rkp1tt> rob_p thanks
[04:11] <linux34892> I have no sound in Ubuntu 12.10 and alsamixer says cannot open mixer: no such file or directory, i tried installing alsa and pulseaudio from the repos... still no sound, soundcard is NVIDIA Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
[04:11] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: The difference in *most* cases should be negligable...
[04:11] <zygoptera> slipp3d | that's true
[04:11] <antonio_> Thats what drives me nuts about linux... "find a different program"
[04:12] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Is your system dipping into swap?
[04:12] <dr_willis> antonio_:  adobe ahs killed air on linux.  it may fail to work at any time. no security updates and so forth
[04:12] <usr13> antonio_: I don't know about samurai  How did you install it?
[04:12] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: If not, then there's no need to worry...
[04:12] <usr13> antonio_: Is this it? > http://www.madirish.net/188 <
[04:12] <dr_willis> adobe is great at screwing things up..
[04:13] <antonio_> nope usr13: www.marketsamurai.com
[04:13] <slipp3d> so i guess i'm stuck not using flash at all ... or down grade to 10.04
[04:13] <zygoptera> slipp3d | I thought you said 12.04 worked?
[04:13] <dr_willis> slipp3d:  i ten to use flash downloader extensions, or flash-replacer extsnioons taht play videos in vlc
[04:14] <dr_willis> slipp3d:  but flash is working for me on 12.10  64bit with my nvidia cards
[04:14] <usr13> antonio_: What file did you download? (Can you give us the filename?
[04:14] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: ...but if you're hitting swap, then you might want to look into ways to avoid it.
[04:14] <slipp3d> 12.04 is what I meant to type ...
[04:15] <usr13> antonio_: Does it offer install packages for different distros?
[04:15] <zygoptera> slipp3d | 12.04 isn't so bad, it will be supported much longer
[04:15] <d1rkp1tt> its not yet... but its brand new and I havent loaded it up
[04:15] <d1rkp1tt> Just thinking, it hasnt got much for what I want to do
[04:16] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Just keep an eye on it.  Also, make sure you understand memory management in Linux before you assume that your system is RAM hungry. Remember, unused RAM is wasted ram! :)
[04:16] <antonio_> usr13: nope
[04:16] <slipp3d> dr_willis, i'm running that on an intel based laptop
[04:16] <antonio_> I've got it working for now
[04:16] <usr13> antonio_: See my PM
[04:16] <d1rkp1tt> rob_p 77mb spare, isnt a lot
[04:17] <usr13> antonio_: ok good.
[04:17] <slipp3d> zygoptera, is 12.04 getting the newest version of xfce? or is it stuck on the older versions?
[04:17] <dr_willis> !latest
[04:17] <ubottu> Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[04:17] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Again, make sure you understand how much *spare* RAM your system actually has!
[04:17] <zygoptera> slipp3d | I believe you can still get the newest xfce
[04:18] <vileman> who know why i couldn't find firefox in awesome except use shell
[04:18] <slipp3d> i'll have to look into that zygoptera that might be an option
[04:18] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: buffers, cache, etc...
[04:18] <cfhowlett> slipp3d, installing xfce is easy ...
[04:18] <zygoptera> slipp3d | but you can't downgrade back to 12.04, you have to reinstall
[04:18] <d1rkp1tt> Yeah I am reading from top and free-m
[04:19] <slipp3d> right ... i'm not worried about it ... just didn't want to backup and reinstall agin ...
[04:19] <slipp3d> +a
[04:19] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Linux memory management is misleading to the uninformed... (not saying that you are, just saying...)
[04:19] <d1rkp1tt> rob_p its ok... Im no expert
[04:19] <slipp3d> brb ...
[04:21] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Just keep an eye on swap and if you start digging into it and the value stadily increases, then you are indeed exhausting your physical RAM and then you'd want to address it.
[04:21] <d1rkp1tt> rob_p Thanks.
[04:21] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: Until then, just enjoy your Ubuntu Server! :)
[04:21] <linux34892> I have no sound in Ubuntu 12.10 and alsamixer says cannot open mixer: no such file or directory, i tried installing alsa and pulseaudio from the repos... still no sound, soundcard is NVIDIA Corporation MCP51 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
[04:21] <rob_p> d1rkp1tt: welcome
[04:22] <zygoptera> linux34892 | does alsaconf detect any sound devices?
[04:22] <usr13> d1rkp1tt: http://sourcefrog.net/weblog/software/linux-kernel/free-mem.html
[04:23] <linux34892> zygoptera: apt-cache search alsaconf
[04:23] <linux34892> zygoptera: no program found matching that; sudo lspci -v shows a soundcard
[04:23] <usr13> linux34892: What version of Ubuntu did you install?  lsb_release -a
[04:23] <zygoptera> linux34892 | hhm. alsaconf usually comes with alsa
[04:24] <d1rkp1tt> usr13, thanks for that
[04:24] <linux34892> zygoptera: just got it working with sudo modprobe snd_hda_intel
[04:24] <zygoptera> ok
[04:24] <usr13> d1rkp1tt: NP
[04:25] <usr13> linux34892: Good.
[04:25] <linux34892> usr13: Description:	Ubuntu 12.10
[04:25] <usr13> linux34892: Did you do minimal install?
[04:25] <xrs> how to install tty font when fontforge is installed?
[04:25] <usr13> linux34892: (I'm wondering why alsa and pulseaudio was not installed.
[04:25] <Ben64> usr13: i was thinking the same thing
[04:26] <usr13> xrs: What?
[04:27] <xrs> google says just double lick the font and click install, but it opens in fontforge and i dont see an "install" button
[04:27] <zygoptera> xrs | are you sure it isn't already installed?
[04:27] <usr13> xrs: man fontforge
[04:28] <xrs> its a custom font that didnt come with ubuntu
[04:28] <Ben64> xrs: you have to open it with "font viewer"

[04:30] <wolftune> anybody know how to access DVDs over a network where a mac is the device with the DVD (and set to sharing)?
[04:30] <nyRednek> question, when building a custom livecd image, what needs to be removed to remove the "install" option?
[04:30] <wolftune> I can't seem to get it to show on my Ubuntu system
[04:30] <xrs> Wolfpack,  do you have samba installed?
[04:30] <wolftune> yes I installed samba
[04:31] <usr13> xrs: See:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Fonts  (ttf-mscorefonts-installer)
[04:31] <wolftune> under smb: workgroup I see the mac, but then it times out when I open it
[04:32] <usr13> wolftune: An Apple computer?
[04:32] <wolftune> the Linux computer is not Apple, the Apple is what I'm trying to access
[04:32] <wolftune> I did not install samba specifically on the Apple
[04:32] <Ben64> can you access it with anything else
[04:33] <Ben64> seems like its an apple problem
[04:33] <wolftune> I can use remote desktop and control the Apple that way
[04:33] <genoobie> hey all
[04:33] <wolftune> hi
[04:33] <cfhowlett> genoobie, greetings
[04:33] <genoobie> I just finished installing lubuntu
[04:34] <genoobie> but the video is a bit screwed up
[04:34] <genoobie> at the login if i hit ctrl+alt+f1
[04:34] <genoobie> I get a text / cli
[04:34] <genoobie> and I can loging
[04:34] <genoobie> login
[04:34] <genoobie> not sure how to fix my video tho
[04:35] <Ben64> genoobie: don't use enter as punctuation. how is the video screwed up? can you post a picture? what video card does the computer have?
[04:36] <genoobie> well it's got some form of S3 / Savage
[04:36] <genoobie> It's hard to describe the video screw-up
[04:36] <genoobie> it certainly cannot display correctly
[04:36] <genoobie> the machine says it has 133 pkgs to be updates
[04:37] <Ben64> give us a picture. and you don't need to use so many lines, use commas or periods or something
[04:37] <cfhowlett> genoobie, for a fresh install on first update, that's about right
[04:37] <thoonai> does ping send thing on other pipes as stdout? and how I detect them?
[04:37] <genoobie> okay, I will try not to use enter as a form of punctuation. Sorry.  I can't quite get a picture online.
[04:37] <loren> usr13 did you get my paste?
[04:37] <Ben64> genoobie: you don't have a cell phone with a camera, or a camera?
[04:38] <genoobie> okay, let me see if I can make that happen...
[04:38] <Tecan> http://pastebin.com/DBaeBSVs
[04:38] <Tecan> howcome i get this
[04:38] <thoonai> does ping send thing on other pipes as stdout? and how I detect them?
[04:39] <RocketLauncher> How can I get Gnome's keyboard shortcuts to work with another window manager? I don't want to fiddle with xbindkeys....
[04:39] <kunji> thoonai: Umm, you mean when someone pings your ip?
[04:39] <TheLordOfTime> Tecan, the 404s are because those PPAs likely don't support the relese you're on (thereby there's nothing to find there, hence 404)
[04:39] <Tecan> ya but how do i delete them
[04:39] <TheLordOfTime> Tecan, as for the getdeb one, i think they're down, but if they aren't its a sign you can't get there
[04:40] <usr13> loren: I don't know.   Send the URL again.
[04:40] <TheLordOfTime> Tecan, remove the entries in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ that correspond to the PPAs
[04:40] <TheLordOfTime> s/entries/files/
[04:40] <Tecan> TY
[04:40] <loren> I'll pick up the problem tomorrow. Need to quit.
[04:41] <usr13> loren: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1587756/ ?
[04:41] <thoonai> kunji: I want to call some programms with a python subprocess, so I called ping and read stdout, but just the general stuff and the summeray appeared on stdout, the rest (steps in between) doesnt
[04:41] <kunji> RocketLauncher: I'm not sure if you can, I don't know how that interacts too well though, maybe your other window manager supports assigning them it's own way?
[04:41] <red82> I am trying to optimize the performance of a magento installation on an ubuntu server.  can anyone suggest a good link for me to read?
[04:42] <cfhowlett> red82, this would be a good question for #ubuntu-server
[04:42] <RocketLauncher> kunji: i'm using dwm, my window manager doesn't handle any of that
[04:42] <red82> ty
[04:42] <RocketLauncher> I just wonder if there's daemon or something i can start
[04:42] <kunji> thoonai: That's interesting... because when I ping I see everything getting printed on stdout, you can check on the command line, e.g. ping google.com
[04:43] <kunji> thoonai: Are you using some non-standard implementation of ping?
[04:43] <gayle> exit
[04:44] <genoobie> Ben64 are you still here? This is what the login screen looks like the login screen looks like this....http://postimage.org/image/76g39fvnl/7648fc50/
[04:44] <thoonai> kunji: the original one from ubuntu, nothing changed
[04:44] <thoonai> if I call it in the terminal I get all output too
[04:45] <kunji> RocketLauncher: Well, I guess you wanted minimalism then, I guess you got it :P  Hmm, reading the wiki page for dwm it sounds like there should be a way from how the dmenu section reads: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwm
[04:46] <kunji> thoonai: here's an example of my ping, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1588100/  You're sure yours doesn't do that?
[04:49] <Tristan128> what kernel version is 12.04 using?
[04:50] <kunji> thoonai: Oh, sorry missed that post, so on terminal you get it all, exactly how are you calling it then?  Shell script called from python?  Directly from python?  It would be good if you pastebin the relevant bit of code.
[04:52] <kunji> Tristan128: There is a chart here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ubuntu_releases
[04:53] <xrs> okay check this. i can manually install the font into my home dir, but this does not address the root cause of why i am here. i am here because the directions on how to install a font using the GUI do not apply because i have fontforge installed. double clicking on the font opens the font in fontforge and not whatever the ubuntu default is, so can you tell me the name of the package that ubuntu is supposed to be using by default?
[04:53] <makara> hi. I'm (12.04) trying to install the latest Evolution (3.2.3 > 3.4.3). I added ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3 and did update, upgrade and install evolution. But it's still 3.2.3?
[04:53] <makara> its so buggy, its a schlepp to use
[04:54] <xrs> you ran sudo apt-get update first?

[04:56] <bluebeat09> hello!. i been trying to fix mi wifi connection for weeks now and nothingg--( wifi disconnects frequently) i have: AR9285 Wireless Network Adapter (PCI-Express)
[04:56] <makara> kunji, less bugs
[04:56] <bluebeat09> pleasee help!
[04:56] <ESphynx> kunji I just like nice defaults :P
[04:56] <xrs> makara,  open you software sources and try enableing backports and proposed updates
[04:56] <djdos> whats the prob
[04:56] <Rakko> I've been able to pinpoint its behavior a little more: one "click" of the scroll wheel scrolls a very small distance, maybe one line. A more vigorous motion of the wheel scrolls by the "normal" (to my standards) amounts.
[04:56] <Rakko> How do I get the initial scroll increment to not be tiny?
[04:56] <kunji> djdos: Did you read this one yet?  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=128668
[04:57] <makara> bluebeat09, what version ubuntu?
[04:57] <bluebeat09> makara: 12.10
[04:57] <kunji> ESphynx: Yeah, me too, just seemed like replacing the whole environment was a bigger jump than installing a few packages.  ^_^

[04:58] <kunji> makara: Umm, do you know for sure the new one is less buggy?  I just  don't use it at all myself.
[04:58] <makara> bluebeat09, the latest usually sorts that out. Guess not in your case. Linux been struggling with wifi cards for years

[05:00] <djdos> ii disabled it
[05:00] <thoonai> kittenmittenz: huh?
[05:01] <djdos> then it told me you hve to enable it
[05:01] <kittenmittenz> huh?
[05:01] <djdos> thats the solution
[05:02] <kunji> makara: Oh, you have it working, nice ^_^
[05:04] <poz> man, is it ever a hassle to get tor to work on x chat
[05:04] <makara> bluebeat09, do you have 'pre-released updates' on? make sure you get the latest updates

[05:10] <UndisclosedServe> (don't mean to spam just checking to see if the irc client im using connected properly)
[05:10] <thoonai> kunji: that would be extremely hilarious since ping is from the 1930s
[05:11] <thoonai> kunji: ok its not, but I think ping was the first programm after the invention of tcp/ip
[05:11] <kunji> thoonai: For instance I don't get the summary when I pipe ping http://paste.ubuntu.com/1588137/  Also I'm having another weird issue:  I've noticed something perplexing T.T, any thoughts on this issue would be appreciated.  I can ping from my desktop to my router 0% packet loss, and from my router to google 0% packet loss, but from my desktop to google I get 10-15% packet loss.  This is over > 30 pings each test and I can reproduce it on re
[05:11] <kunji> thoonai: I hope ping is ok though ^_^
[05:11] <digitalphiltv> alrighty... I am still having fan issues...and the url from the bot's !fan command which someone tried to get me to run earlier, leads me to a blank page. I'm running k10temp sensors trying to get lm-sensors' fancontrol script to run my fan because at the moment the fan is IDLING and my laptop is running VERY HOT... any ideas out there? thanks!
[05:12] <thoonai> kunji: may I ask you where do you live ^^?
[05:12] <xrs> okay found the solution. my system was missing the package "gnome-font-viewer"
[05:12] <kunji> thoonai: How specifically :P  Michigan.
[05:13] <thoonai> in soviet russia packet losses you
[05:13] <digitalphiltv> /usr/sbin/pwmconfig: There are no pwm-capable sensor modules installed
[05:13]  * digitalphiltv is about ready to shoot pwmconfig
[05:13] <thoonai> kunji: you shouldn't have packet loss there ^^
[05:14] <kunji> xrs: Oh... that is for installing fonts?  I thought it was just for viewing them... I've always just installed them on the cmd so I didn't know the answer to GUI questions about it or I would have helped :P
[05:14] <kunji> thoonai: I know right, especially because it's ping A -> B ok, ping B -> C ok, ping A -> C ERROR
[05:15] <thoonai>  dont know, ethernet is voodoo, nothing to worry about
[05:15] <thoonai> its like hf

[05:17] <Rakko> I find mouse scrolling in modern Ubuntu annoying: one "click" of the scroll wheel scrolls a very small distance, maybe one line. A more vigorous motion of the wheel scrolls by the "normal" (to my standards) amounts. How can I make scrolling always jump a decent (and preferably consistent) amount?
[05:18] <Rakko> I don't remember it being like this in 10.10
[05:18] <thoonai> kunji: thx and I'll quit here and get some stuff working :)
[05:18] <thoonai> cu around
[05:20] <kunji> Rakko: I remember seeing a setting for how many lines it should scroll somewhere.. I can't seem to find it right now though.
[05:24] <Rakko> kunji: hmm.
[05:24] <OpheliaPandide> I need help with wifi upon installing 12.10 onto my mac 10.7
[05:24] <Rakko> actually maybe it's just firefox that is lame in this regard
[05:25] <OpheliaPandide> I have tried a lot of different things and found none to work
[05:25] <OpheliaPandide> I have to use a usb
[05:25] <kunji> Rakko: Oh, I'm pretty sure I can find the firefox setting for that, I'm pretty sure they use their own
[05:25] <Rakko> of course. firefox ftw
[05:25] <kittenmittens> can someone tell e why my laptop and pc both die after i update them
[05:26] <OpheliaPandide> does anyone have any ideas as to the wifi problem??
[05:26] <kunji> Rakko: Well, they have a lot of setting you can play with, type about:config in the address bar, press enter, tell them you'll be careful and search for mousewheel
[05:26] <kunji> *settings
[05:26] <kittenmittens> opheliapandide, have you looked in aditional drivers to see if theres a wifi driver to activate
[05:26] <Rakko> kunji: ok. I turned off "smooth scrolling" and that helped!
[05:27] <kunji> Rakko: nice ^_^
[05:27] <Rakko> but the Mac trackpad support is still laggy-feeling. oh well
[05:27] <Rakko> I'm hopefully gonna ditch this laptop soon
[05:27] <OpheliaPandide> I looked in software sources --> additional drivers
[05:27] <kittenmittens> anyone???
[05:27] <IveBeenBit> I am trying to learn the concepts behind mounting and unmounting. I go to the launcher and type "disks" which is an app that lets you see the drives attached to the system. It says my flashdrive mount point is /mnt/usb-SanDisk_Cruiser... is the mount point. Why is /mnt empty though when I ls -l /mnt?
[05:27] <OpheliaPandide> but no driver
[05:28] <kittenmittens> agh
[05:28] <kittenmittens> i need a ubuntu genious
[05:28] <kittenmittens> or a ubuntu doctor
[05:28] <Rakko> i.e. I have to move my two fingers almost halfway across the trackpad before scrolling even starts. makes everything feel very slow
[05:28] <Rakko> kittenmittens: "die"?
[05:29] <kittenmittens> well on my laptop i get filesyst em is readonly, and on pc it freezes at the startup
[05:29] <kittenmittens> sooo...
[05:29] <kittenmittens> both happen after upadting, so i dont

[05:29] <OpheliaPandide> from
[05:29] <kunji> IveBeenBit: Umm... never heard of this disks command.  I think it might be looking at cached default mount points done by the automounting?  I think what you should read on is the mount command, umount, the mtab file, and the fstab file.
[05:31] <Rakko> kittenmittens: ouch. have you asked on askubuntu or a mailing list?
[05:31] <kittenmittens> no
[05:31] <kunji> IveBeenBit: Also for getting general info about your disks read about fdisk, parted, and blkid, also maybe hdparm
[05:31] <IveBeenBit> kunji, "Disks" is a graphical app that came with Ubuntu 12.10 check it out. It reminds me of gparted. Also, thanks for the tips.
[05:31] <kittenmittens> ive been trying to get it to work on both for over a week
[05:31] <kittenmittens> dove every possible harware test, windows works flawlessly, not ubuntu
[05:32] <IveBeenBit> kunji, that's too much info for me right now as I'm still too noobish. I will be happy when I can mount and unmount USBs and IMG files from the terminal. :-)
[05:34] <kunji> IveBeenBit: Hmm, do you know the package name?  I don't have a package called disks.  Maybe udisks, or gnome-disk-utility?
[05:34] <kittenmittens> so am i doomed to windows?
[05:34] <kunji> IveBeenBit: mount is the one you want for mount the USBs, and umount to unmount them.  IMG files I forget the command for, it involves a loopback device gimme a sec to look it up.
[05:35] <IveBeenBit> kunji, This is the homepage from the "about" menu. I think it is just called "disks." https://live.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Disks
[05:35] <kunji> IveBeenBit: Ah, both the packages I mentioned seem to be what it is (read the part under Status)
[05:37] <kunji> IveBeenBit: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/2747/ubuntu_how_to_mount_unmount_iso_files/ Hmm, I think it's pretty much the same process for .img as well
[05:37] <np8> Hi! I'm having a problem with my wireless network. On ubuntu 12.04 it is dropping me from the internet. After it has dropped me, it tries to reconnect, asks the password and tries to reconnect forever. I tried disabling->enabling the wireless funtionality (the "flying mode") but it doesn't help. Is here anyone who can read the crash reports (i have it as 9 png's on google drive).
[05:37] <IveBeenBit> kunji, Thanks! Adding it to my reading list now!
[05:37] <kittenmittens> i feel like background noise
[05:39] <antonio_> I'm getting a bunch of errors when I first start ubuntu 12.10 up
[05:39] <ubuntuuser> hello people. having trouble with wifi. lspci shows atheros ar9285. rfkill list shows hardblocked: yes. Side switch on the network has been toggled on/off multiple times. fn+f5 showing wifi signal has been toggled multiple times. nothing. this used to work on live usb on boot. now it doesn't. any help will be appreciated.
[05:39] <antonio_> is there a terminal command I can run to find out what the hell is going on?
[05:40] <antonio_> anyone?
[05:40] <sockswithsandals> Hello
[05:41] <ubuntuuser> lshw -class network still shows *-network DISABLED.
[05:41] <ice-> .
[05:41] <sockswithsandals> Is there a way to get the oldschool verbose boot with the little tux in the upper left corner?
[05:41] <np8> ubuntuuser: I'm having almost the same problem.. my crash report is here: https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B-msgBr6cWoATmQxVzBuS1VpYjA/edit .. anyone know what I can do? Rebooting helps, though.
[05:41] <antonio_> I'm so over ubuntu
[05:41] <antonio_> nothing is working
[05:41] <antonio_> I can't open pdfs
[05:41] <ubuntuuser> np8: mine doesn't work with rebooting. doesn't work at all. using wired currently.
[05:42] <ice-> anyone knows if there's an IRC channel for picuntu? http://code.google.com/p/rk3066-linux/wiki/PicUntu
[05:42] <kittenmittens> how do i make ubuntu work
[05:42] <ubuntuuser> antonio_: you're trying to open pdf file using what?
[05:42] <sockswithsandals> antonio_: Why not?
[05:42] <antonio_> document viewer
[05:42] <antonio_> doesn't open them
[05:42] <sockswithsandals> WHat does it say?
[05:42] <antonio_> nothing
[05:42] <antonio_> it doesn't do anything
[05:42] <kunji> kittenmittens: It's because no one here at the moment knows the answer and you've been spamming a bit.  Typically you should just ask your question and then be patient because if someone knows they will help.  If your question is long or you have lots of supporting data (logs, screenshots, etc..) you should pastebin them and post the link with your question.  You should probably not ask the question again for at least 15 minutes, otherwise 
[05:42] <ubuntuuser> sockswithsandals: the tux logo was part of the free kernel settings. so suppose you'll have to recompile the kernel unless that has changed lately.
[05:42] <sockswithsandals> try opening it in the terminal, antonio_
[05:43] <gh403> Grub2 recommends that it not be installed to a partition's boot sector.  Yet Ubuntu seems to do this if you ask it, during the installation.  Is this an issue in practice?
[05:43] <dr_willis> gh403:  if you tell it to install to sda1 yes it can... but normally it would go on sda
[05:43] <kittenmittens> -_-
[05:43] <gh403> dr_willis:
[05:43] <dr_willis> gh403:  some people want to chainload grub
[05:44] <ubuntuuser> antonio_: it doesn't open any pdfs or just the one you've tried. some pdfs tend to be huge and take a while to open. others tends to be empty.
[05:44] <antonio_> I'm also getting a lot of all pdfs
[05:45] <gh403> Yeah, I want to, dr_willis.  But Grub doesn't like that.  See the blue box in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GRUB2#Install_to_Partition_or_Partitionless_Disk
[05:45] <antonio_> also I'm getting a lot of "system program problem detected...do you want to report the problem now"
[05:46] <antonio_> is there any way to find out what is broken on my system?
[05:47] <Rabblerouser> I just messed up my Wubi install. :S
[05:48] <ubuntuuser> antonio_: is this a livecd or a properly installed system? system program problem sounds a little serious.
[05:48] <Rabblerouser> Was trying to get graphics drivers on, but.. erm... when I restarted, I had no.. no Unity. No bar at the top when logging in, no sidebar. Just a wallpaper.
[05:49] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  what video card?
[05:49] <antonio_> ubuntuuser: its installed
[05:49] <Rabblerouser> I rightclicked to go to appearance settings, then backed out to see it wasn't running under "Unknown" but "VESA RV(something)"
[05:49] <Rabblerouser> ATI Radeon HD 4670
[05:50] <dr_willis> and how did you install the drivers Rabblerouser ?
[05:50] <antonio_> brb
[05:51] <Rabblerouser> Well, I kinda.. forgot there were updates in the background, so I went to looking for guidance online (sorta newbie) The tries in Terminal were blocked because apparently something else was looking at the process?
[05:51] <Rabblerouser> I'll just reinstall the Wubi thing
[05:52] <Rabblerouser> At least I think they USED to call it Wubi.
[05:52] <dr_willis> better to avoid wubi
[05:52] <Rabblerouser> How so, dr_willis?
[05:52] <dr_willis> its fragile, flakey, crashy, and slower then a full install
[05:53] <antonio_> ubuntu 12.10 is starting to get very annoying
[05:53] <Rabblerouser> I did notice it was incredibly slower than the LiveUSB.. I chocked that up to not having a proper graphics driver installed yet
[05:54] <antonio_> 10.04 worked fine...and I stupidly updated
[05:54] <antonio_> I'm getting a ton of crashes
[05:54] <dr_willis> !10,04

[05:55] <dr_willis> for desktop at least
[05:55] <antonio_> frick..I can't even open a damn pdf
[05:55] <Rabblerouser> Any idea when a 13.xx LTS might release? :3 And what it might bring?
[05:55] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  the version # is the date... year/month
[05:55] <dr_willis> of reelease
[05:56] <Rabblerouser> Aaaah. Gotcha.
[05:56] <dr_willis> Rabblerouser:  the omgubuntu and webupd8 blog sites have articals on whats going to be new in 13.04

[06:00] <antonio_> dr_willis: is there any kind of program I can run silently to find out what the hell is going on???
[06:00] <antonio_> or a term command to fix this crap?
[06:00] <kittenmittens> how do i make ubuntu work
[06:01] <dr_willis> antonio_:   if you ahve a lot of apps core duming. it could be some memory issues.. or other very complex problems that are going to be hard to track down

I eventually just killed the updater and tried running 'sudo update-initramfs -vvv -u' in a terminal and it keeps hanging again once it gets to 'Adding module /lib/modules/3.2.0-36-generic-pae/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/hp/hp100.ko' I have found nothing online so

[06:15] <dr_willis> scary_one:  you really need to be seeing their forum and support site - since its not  stuff from the ubuntu repositories
[06:15] <gormanator> I was just wondering if anyone here had any experience with getting multitouch to work
[06:15] <gormanator> and if they would help me out...if not no worries
[06:16] <scary_one> dr_willis tried to get help from them :) they directed my here :D
[06:16] <dr_willis> scary_one:  that would be a good sign to not use their stuff...
[06:16] <dr_willis> most people use the xswat ppa's for updateing X stuff.
[06:16] <dr_willis> ive never heard of anyone in here mention 01.org
=== Guest4328 is now known as atom1sk
[06:17] <scary_one> its intel linux site
[06:18] <kunji> dr_willis: Isn't all the stuff on their site already in Ubuntu?  Why repackage it.. weird.
[06:19] <dr_willis> xswat has newer updates not in the official repos
[06:19] <dr_willis> no idea what 01.org is doing ;)
[06:19] <dr_willis> unless its where the xswat guys get the updated patches and code from
[06:19] <neodragon> OK so I am updating my daughters edubuntu 12.04  laptop and the first thing I noticed was it kept hanging when it got to updating initramfs, no errors, it just hung there.

[06:20] <kunji> scary_one: I think when they referred you here they meant for you to use the versions in the Ubuntu repos, my best guess is that they package it like that for people that are using distros without their own facilities.
[06:23] <scary_one> any ideas how to fix it?
[06:23] <juliano_> join//

[06:24] <Ben64> Rabblerouser: ok thats not really descriptive. its based on ubuntu but uses a different DE and other stuff
[06:24] <Rabblerouser> Domo arigato, Mr. ubottu
[06:24] <scary_one> i think it will be easier and quikcer to reinstall
[06:24] <Ben64> scary_one: could be
[06:24] <scary_one> :)
[06:25] <kunji> scary_one: Could be if you just installed.  Maybe just removing the package an installing from the Ubuntu repos would work.
[06:25] <kunji> *and
[06:27] <neodragon> can anyone help me with a initramfs update that just hangs, no errors, nothing, it just hangs and never completes and now after I killed that process it won't let me use synaptic or apt-get either, it says another process is running
[06:29] <kunji> That 01.org logo looks a lot like the nepomuk one.  They seem legit except that the intel logo is nowhere to be found, there is a copyright notice at the bottom of the page.  Maybe their lack of branding is supposed to make them seem more open source friendly... or to distance the rest of the company from it, who knows...
[06:30] <kittenmittens> is it possible that ubuntu 13.04 will run better on my pc than 12.10, im aving alot of issues with 12.10
[06:36] <xrs> your welcome to try out the latest builds and proposed updates
[06:37] <vvoid> I went through a crypto nightmare, but I could restore my data thanks to all of your good work. Thanks. Btw: never let your ecryptfs mounts run out of space
[06:37] <xrs> or try out an older version that is still supported
[06:37] <xrs> thanks vvoid
[06:38] <vvoid> I used to be more one of the rtfm guys, but there are times when one is in need of good community work
[06:40] <neodragon> ok so even though I see multiple posts online about ubuntu 12.04 hanging in the middle of updating initramfs, no one in here either has any idea about how to fix it or cares to help is that it?

[06:43] <TheLordOfTime> (although i suggest 12.04 since 11.10 EOLs in april)
[06:44] <Ububegin> TheLordOfTime: This is a legacy machine... Isnt there any archives to still cont'd apt-get -ing
[06:45] <TheLordOfTime> Ububegin, not with 10.10.
[06:45] <TheLordOfTime> !eol | Ububegin
[06:45] <ubottu> Ububegin: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[06:45] <xrs> neodragon,  have you tried turning on verbose=yes in /etc/default/rcS and logging the startup?
[06:45] <TheLordOfTime> Ububegin, you can try using old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu instead in your apt repos/mirrors
[06:46] <TheLordOfTime> but those aren't supported, keep that in mind
[06:46] <TheLordOfTime> since 10.10's EOL it gets *no* security updates and *no* other updates
[06:46] <neodragon> xrs: its not the startup/boot that is the problem, it boots just fine, it is the updating of initramfs that hangs and it keeps hanging on '/lib/modules/3.2.0-36-generic-pae/kernel/drivers/net/ethernet/hp/hp100.ko' for some reason, but it gives no errors
[06:47] <lud> i need help on ARM image
[06:48] <neodragon> xrs: or rather it hangs when it gets to adding that module during the update
[06:48] <scaris> hm
[06:48] <scaris> changed my default display manager to gdm
=== scaris is now known as scary_one
[06:49] <scary_one> now i'm stuck at ubuntu load screen
[06:50] <scary_one> the dot's are channging colors buut nothing else happens
[06:50] <lud> i want to install ubuntu ARM image to an m960 android tablet
[06:55] <xrs> neodragon,  first thing i would try is removing that package, updateing, then put it back on
[06:55] <xrs> driver*
[07:00] <xrs> aww i found an answer for him but he left
[07:01] <kittenmittens> i need answers
[07:02] <xrs> to what? im sorry all i see is your question about 13.04
[07:02] <kittenmittens> dont worry :) nobodys been able to help me all week
[07:03] <xrs> to that i say you are free to roll back to an older version of ubuntu, or try out the latest builds and proposed updates
[07:03] <kittenmittens> ive tryed 12.04 12.10 and im about to try 13.04
[07:04] <Ben64> kittenmittens: give more info. just saying "i need help" or "it doesn't work" does not help
[07:04] <red82> xrs: you were just too slow for neodragon
[07:04] <red82> shame really
[07:06] <kittenmittens> well i dont know whats wrong, after installing i update and everything breaks every time, its always differnt, ether my filesystem goes read only and nobody can fix that for a week, or like now it just wont boot
[07:06] <xrs> lol i know who you are
[07:06] <xrs> what filesystem are you using?
[07:07] <kittenmittens> its not my hardware, redownloaded ubuntu countless times, checked md5 every time, tryed cd and usb, and having the same issues on 2 comouters
[07:07] <kittenmittens> me? ive tryed both ext3 and 4
[07:07] <kittenmittens> no difference
[07:08] <xrs> how long does the clean install take?
[07:08] <kittenmittens> like 10 minutes?
[07:08] <xrs> hmm
[07:08] <xrs> if it was a USB issue it would take a lot longer than that.
[07:08] <kittenmittens> all my hardware is fine
[07:09] <kittenmittens> ive checked literally 50 billion times now, everyone keeps blaming my hardware or the iso
[07:09] <xrs> well i had similar problems and my problem was the thumbdrives. i had to buy new ones
[07:09] <kittenmittens> i tryed cd too
[07:09] <kittenmittens> and 2 thumb drives
[07:09] <kittenmittens> nothing is broke n
[07:09] <xrs> next the problems i was having had to do with udisks. it didnt have proper support for ext2
[07:09] <kepler> install it in a VM on the computer you're on now, if you do everything the same and it works, then it is hardware
[07:10] <kittenmittens> its not the hardware
[07:10] <kepler> well millions of other people are using the same ISOs, so it isn't ubuntu
[07:10] <kepler> it may not be faulty hardware, it may just be unsupported hardware
[07:10] <xrs> kittenmittens,  its a good idea.   when troubleshooting computers you gotta tinker and rule out all possibilities, find out what works (and i dont mean just hardware) and what doesnt
[07:11] <kittenmittens> mhmm.. my brand new computer that has a readout screen of every tiny issue that could possibly happen, on the motherboard hasnt found anything
[07:11] <kittenmittens> ive doe checks and tests people ahve told me to do for days
[07:11] <xrs> so currently it is not booting, can you see anything on the screen?
[07:11] <kittenmittens> ive ruled out hardware
[07:11] <xrs> can you watch the startup process?
[07:11] <kepler> what computer is it? do other operating systems work?
[07:12] <kittenmittens> it goes purple and we tryed a differnt kernal and it gets stuck at initializing ramdisks? or something
[07:12] <kittenmittens> windows works flawlessly
[07:12] <kepler> do you have a link to the hardware in it?
[07:13] <kittenmittens> its an 8core amd 3+ at 3.5 ghz, on an asus crosshair vformula z motherboard, with 16 gigs of ddr3 1866mhz ram at 10 - 10 - 10 -24 clocks, on 2 sticks. i have a 250 gb vortex 4 sata 3 ssd
[07:13] <xrs> kittenmittens,  there is some good info here: http://blog.tridgell.net/?p=57
[07:13] <kittenmittens> and an msi 7950 -_-
[07:14] <kepler> ok, in bios do you have the hd stuff set to ahci, ide passthrough, anything?
[07:14] <kittenmittens> ill check
[07:15] <kittenmittens> the post is so fast you gotta use a button on the motherboard to get to it.. its anoying
=== Kneferilis__ is now known as Kneferilis
[07:15] <kepler> uefi stuff can be weird too
[07:16] <xrs> yeah hardware ment for win8 boots way too fast
[07:16] <kittenmittens> um
[07:16] <kittenmittens> i dont know how to do that on my bios.. theres litterlally thousands of options
[07:17] <kittenmittens> oh i found it
[07:17] <xrs> im sure there was a manual printed
[07:17] <kittenmittens> on chip sata channel is enabled, and they are all set to ahci
=== root is now known as Guest38555
[07:17] <kittenmittens> and sata esp is disabled ona ll the ports, i dont know what that means
[07:17] <xrs> bookmark that page i gave ya so u can check it l8r
[07:18] <JustinW> yo
[07:18] <kittenmittens> i cant, i have no stable os atm
[07:18] <xrs> no persistence file?
[07:18] <kittenmittens> so can anyone help me?
[07:18] <JustinW> what is a good tool for automatic file replication between servers?
[07:18] <JustinW> ubuntu linux.
[07:18] <kepler> what other options are there for the ahci?
[07:18] <xrs> yeah that page i gave you has some useful info
[07:19] <kittenmittens> ide and raid
[07:19] <kepler> throw it on ide and see how it goes
[07:20] <kittenmittens> wont that make it slower
[07:20] <kepler> no
[07:20] <kepler> it is still a 3 or 6g sata port, it just pretends it is ide
[07:20] <kittenmittens> locked up on purple screen again
[07:20] <xrs> JustinW, http://sourceforge.net/projects/synchronicity/?source=directory
[07:21] <kepler> what do you see prior to that purple screen?
[07:21] <xrs> kittenmittens,  do you have persistence?
[07:21] <kittenmittens> nothing
[07:21] <kittenmittens> i dont know what that is xrs
[07:21] <kepler> no post, grub, nothing?
[07:21] <kittenmittens> i can get grub if i spam shift like a maniake sometimes
[07:22] <xrs> are you running from a live USB, if you were to save a file to it would it still be there next time you booted? why cant you look at that page
[07:22] <kittenmittens> and i never see post
[07:22] <Sara> hey, I m using dualboot win 7 ubuntu 12.04. needed to reinstall win 7. used bootrepair recomended option and now my win is working but grub is not
[07:22] <Sara> I don't see any option to log in ubuntu
[07:22] <kepler> and you get through the entire install successfully, and it asks you to reboot, then does this?
[07:22] <Ben64> !grub | Sara
[07:22] <ubottu> Sara: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[07:23] <kittenmittens> no, it works fine and lovingly
[07:23] <Sara> thanks ben
[07:23] <kittenmittens> untill i update, or install graphics drivers, or sometimes randomly after a restart
[07:24] <kepler> ok, so when you update, are you using the provided opensource drivers, or proprietary?
[07:24] <Sara> but it is just saying to use boot repair
[07:24] <Sara> I already used bootrepair
[07:24] <greek> Hi how do I check whether my system is 32 or 64 bit? Thanks.
[07:24] <kittenmittens> tryed both
[07:24] <Sara> my win is working
[07:24] <kepler> greek, uname -a
[07:24] <greek> kepler thanks
[07:25] <kepler> kittenmittens, then it is something else. try doing only software updates, without drivers. see if those work
[07:25] <kittenmittens> kelper is a space teliscoe that found alot of planets
[07:25] <kepler> is that machine on right now? if you hit ctrl+alt+f3, does it go to a console?
[07:25] <kittenmittens> ok.. on 12.10 or 13.04?
[07:26] <kittenmittens> no its completly frozen
[07:26] <kepler> numlock doesn't go off and on if you hit it?
[07:26] <kittenmittens> no
[07:27] <kittenmittens> so want me to install 13.04 or 12.10?
[07:27] <kepler> well, you're right, does't seem like hardware.
[07:27] <Ben64> why not 12.04?
[07:27] <kepler> id go with 12.10
[07:28] <tahitipetey> How would I get my *public* IPv6 address from within the terminal? (I'm ssh'd into an instance remotely, no GUI/browsers to visit sites like my-ip6.com). If it makes any difference, it's an Amazon EC2 instance.
[07:28] <xrs> that page i linked describes your exact problem and how it was fixed. did you ever look at it?
[07:29] <Ben64> tahitipetey: ifconfig
[07:29] <kepler> tahitipetey, netstat -ie
[07:29] <genoobie> hey all
[07:29] <genoobie> questions about video here
[07:30] <genoobie> I have a crappy video card
[07:30] <genoobie> an lubuntu install that doesn't quite work and an xubuntu live that gives me video
[07:30] <genoobie> here's the thing
[07:30] <FloodBot1> genoobie: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[07:31] <kittenmittens> whats the oem installl do
[07:31] <xrs> its for OEMs who have their own configs and answer files
[07:32] <genoobie> I was hoping to use the video information from the live CD to somehow help lubuntu get started.  When I boot lubuntu, the splash screen is OK, but the screen for lightdm looks goofed.  When I go the the xubuntu livecd, there's obviously no dm
[07:32] <JustinW> is this IRC for ubuntu server (ubuntu linux on servers)?
[07:32] <JustinW> or mainly the os lol
[07:32] <Ben64> ubuntu support
[07:32] <xrs> #ubuntu-server
[07:33] <genoobie> so the wm/de screen is just fine.  any tips on how to get the lubuntu jumpstarted?  I was going to try and bypass the dm, with an ~/.xinitrc
[07:33] <genoobie> but I don't have rw access to the drive or the permissions are funny...
[07:33] <tahitipetey> Ben64 & kepler: Ah, right, since IPv6 addresses are global, what's on ifconfig would be the global address! Jeez, why didn't I realize that earlier, hah.
[07:33] <genoobie> any suggestions?
[07:34] <Ben64> tahitipetey: not exactly, but since its a server there isn't going to be an internal address/nat stuff going on
[07:34] <Ben64> genoobie: when you're installing it should ask you about logging in automatically
[07:34] <p4> #jogja
[07:34] <tahitipetey> Ben64: EC2 servers *are* behind NAT. It's IPv4 address on ifconfig is not the global address.
[07:34] <genoobie> ben64, no, sadly it didn't
[07:34] <kepler> the ipv6 should be global
[07:34] <Ben64> tahitipetey: really? weird
[07:34] <kepler> unless you have an fe80:: or something
[07:35] <genoobie> my guess is that will fix the problem
[07:35] <genoobie> but I'm not sure how to make that happen
[07:35] <tahitipetey> kepler: Ouch... I do. Or rather, the server does have a fe80::... address :(
[07:35] <Ben64> genoobie: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1472113
[07:35] <kepler> that is link local then
[07:36] <kepler> is it fe80:<mac address>:<other stuff> ?
[07:36] <genoobie> Ben64, I'll try that, thanks!
[07:37] <anan_> Hi, just reconnected to screen and prompt changed to 'user@host:(unreachable)/$' - pwd doesn't return home eitheir, or anything for that matter
[07:37] <Sara> I faild to repair my grub2 need help
[07:37] <Ben64> tahitipetey: you could use a website that tells you your public address then
[07:37] <genoobie> Ben64, does it use lxdm or lightdm
[07:37] <Ben64> genoobie: might be lightdm, not sure
[07:38] <genoobie> eff, I'll edit every dm file
[07:38] <Sara> grub rescue is usefull before using bootrepair. I already have my win I
[07:38] <p4> hi
[07:38] <p4> i need help
[07:39] <Sara> reinstalled windows 7 and repaired using recommended option now win works but I cannot log in ubuntu anymore
[07:39] <Sara> can somone walk with me through it?
[07:39] <Ben64> Sara: what didn't work when you tried to fix grub
[07:39] <xrs> !boot-repair
[07:39] <kittenmittens> yeah windows bootloader messes up ubuntus and looads before it
[07:40] <Sara> I cannot see the page that says file not found > rescure grub
[07:40] <kittenmittens> thats why you always install llinux after windows, unless you wanna be mucking around
[07:40] <xrs> sara, you will need to boot the computer using a live CD or DVD
[07:41] <kittenmittens> or usb
[07:41] <Sara> Im in live cd
[07:41] <Sara> live usb actually
[07:41] <xrs> you have boot-repair installed?
[07:41] <Ben64> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[07:41] <Ben64> start at 2nd option
[07:41] <seeqwell> grub-rescue-pc - GRUB bootable rescue images, version 2 (PC/BIOS version) Sara
=== root____2 is now known as ail
[07:42] <Sara> that would be great if we could repair it just with ubuntu live usb not by makeing another bootable usb
[07:43] <Ben64> you can
[07:43] <Sara> Ben64 can you tell me how
[07:43] <Sara> ?
[07:43] <Ben64> i just pasted the link
[07:43] <tripelb> Re if I receivers/adaptors. Here's the list from MonoPrice http://www.monoprice.com/products/subdepartment.asp?c_id=105&cp_id=10501 --doew anyone know if any of these is k own to work with Ubuntu?   Not a long list, 3 cards, one g and 3 n. And 2 more N's at double speed 300 Mps
[07:43] <kittenmittens> im updating, so we will see..
[07:44] <kepler> skipping drivers?
[07:44] <Ben64> tripelb: read the comments on them
[07:44] <kittenmittens> yeah
[07:44] <kepler> tahitipetey, http://mellowd.co.uk/ccie/?p=1363 has some info on the ipv6 ranges if you're interested.
[07:44] <Sara> I saw the link its using different methods to repair grub i don't know which is mine
[07:44] <tahitipetey> kepler: Thanks! I'll read through that :)
[07:44] <kittenmittens> whats is ipv6 for?
[07:45] <kittenmittens> THINGS ONLY USE IPV6?
[07:45] <kepler> increase IP address space
[07:45] <Ben64> Sara: i said start at 2nd option
[07:45] <kepler> right now we're on ipv4
[07:45] <kittenmittens> caps*
[07:45] <kepler> which was actually an experiment that just got out of hand
[07:45] <kittenmittens> why do we need more space
[07:45] <kepler> we're out of ipv4 addresses, actually
[07:45] <kittenmittens> really?
[07:45] <xrs> its like running out of telephone numbers and having to add extra digits
[07:45] <kepler> well, they have all been assigned. i think due to poor planning, we only actually use like 15% of them
[07:46] <kittenmittens> but not everything accepts ipv6 adresses
[07:46] <Ben64> pretty much everything does now, but this is offtopic
=== ecthiender_ is now known as ecthiender
[07:46] <kepler> i think everything does now
[07:46] <kittenmittens> are we talking about isp provided adresses? /exchange
[07:46] <kepler> yes
[07:46] <kittenmittens> hm
[07:46] <tahitipetey> kittenmittens: All ISP's are IPv6 complaint. Since June a few years back...
[07:47] <kepler> if you want to knwo more, we can go to off topic, or you can PM me, Ben64 is right, this isn't the place for that talk
[07:47] <kittenmittens> ive never really nudged into external ip's
[07:47] <tahitipetey> Oh, I shouldn't say "All". Certainly the North American/European ones. Can't vouch for some backwater ISP in some developing nation...
[07:48] <kittenmittens> learning is fun :) thank god for the collective human knowledge being at my fingertips
[07:48] <anan_> Hi, anyone know why terminal prompt says 'user@host:(unreachable)/$' after reconnecting with a detached screen?
[07:49] <Sara> is it possible to write grub commands without logging off ubuntu?
[07:49] <Ben64> anan_: do you have encryption on the drive or the home directory?
[07:49] <Sara> terminal does not accept it
[07:49] <Ben64> Sara: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[07:50] <genoobie> Ugh, Ben64 that didn't work...
[07:50] <anan_> Ben64: I don't think so, it might be nothing as it only occured after calling on screen using it's pid
[07:50] <genoobie> it must be the mode of the monitor
[07:50] <genoobie> any way to change that from cli?
[07:51] <anan_> Ben64: only pwd doesn't return anything anymore :P
[07:52] <genoobie> the splash screens look great
[07:52] <Sara> my grub location and grub options are gray (not available)
[07:52] <genoobie> the only thing that I can think is that the installer was a text installer
[07:53] <thechef> Is nvidia-current-updates in 12.04 not pointing to 310, because 1) it never will in 12.04, 2) nvidia doesn't declare 310 as stable-enough for LTS systems 3) still in testing 4) because 304 is still supported and for >304 version to appear in LTS 304 must first come to EOL 5) other?

[08:00] <juniour> hi guys how to format write procted usb drives or sd card
[08:00] <juniour> plz help
[08:00] <kittenmittens> thats what it says
[08:00] <kepler> go into settings and change it from xrandr or whatever to the other option
[08:00] <Ben64> kittenmittens: then start up in Ubuntu 2D
[08:00] <aeon-ltd> juniour: if there's a hardware tab switch it to writable first...
[08:00] <xrs> alumno20,  try #ubuntu-es
[08:01] <linocisco> is there any Nagio like free software for infrastructure monitoring?
[08:01] <kittenmittens> mmh

[08:01] <juniour> aeon-ltd explain plz
[08:01] <juniour> wt hard ware tab its sd card
[08:01] <helmut_> hi
[08:02] <aeon-ltd> juniour: sometimes they have a tab that switches it from writable to read only
[08:02] <xrs> some SD cards have a lock. an actual lock you can slide
[08:02] <xrs> like the old floppy disks
[08:02] <juniour> no nothing like that
[08:02] <Ben64> almost every sd card has one
[08:02] <juniour> it a micro sd card of 2gb
[08:02] <kepler> kittenmittens, try sudo apt-get install fglrx
[08:02] <kepler> that is what i use for my workstation
[08:02] <juniour> it write procted
[08:03] <juniour> how will i remove
[08:03] <linocisco> is there any Nagio like free software for infrastructure monitoring?
[08:03] <juniour> or formate the sd card

[08:05] <xrs> basso,  check out tip #10 http://www.upubuntu.com/2012/06/11-tips-to-speed-up-computers-running.html
[08:05] <kepler> sudo apt-get install fglrx ??
[08:05] <kepler> did you get install in there
[08:05] <xrs> he has no swap. changing the swappiness isnt going to do anything
[08:05] <kittenmittens> ah that worked
[08:05] <juniour> hee thanks all i got it :)
[08:06] <xrs> instead i directed him to move the /tmp dir to RAM
[08:06] <basso> aeon-ltd: but I don't have a swap partion on my computer
[08:06] <juniour> basso use 64 bit operating system
[08:06] <aeon-ltd> i've no experience with them, but would a ramdisk be worth the effort
[08:06] <aeon-ltd> ?
[08:06] <xrs> yes
[08:06] <linocisco> ok
[08:06] <basso> juniour: i am using a 64bit operatingsystem :)
[08:06] <basso> thinkpad master race
[08:06] <Ben64> i have /tmp on ram, and i only have 8GB
[08:06] <Sara> ben64  what does it mean:   root@ubuntu:/home/ubuntu# mount /dev/sda4/ mnt mount: mount point mnt does not exist
[08:06] <Ben64> Sara: what are you doing?!
[08:06] <kingbeast> linocisco: pm!!
[08:07] <aeon-ltd> Sara: that's not the right syntax
[08:07] <Ben64> Sara: i've given you this link 4 times now, this is much easier than anything you're trying to do. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[08:07] <juniour> basso then you will be able to use most of the ram, except some of it will be restricted for hardware
[08:07] <Sara> I installed win 7 and i used recommended option in bootrepair win came back not ubuntu
[08:08] <Sara> the rest is according http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxZRjjPjic8
[08:08] <juniour> Sara fix mbr
[08:08] <xrs> sara seriously. what are you doing. Ben64  gave you very simple way to fix it
[08:09] <Hanmac_> i hope someone could help me i have a crititcal vhost problem ... i try to access vhost1 with addr "xyz.local" but for some reason it trys to redirect me to "abc.local" with was an old vhost ... and i dont know how to deactivate this ... ("abc.local" is removed from all etc/hosts files ... )
[08:09] <Sara> Ok i didnot understand that . he gave me boot repair link
[08:09] <basso> there, i have moved /tmp to ram
[08:09] <Sara> and grub location and grub options are gray
[08:09] <Ben64> basso: you could also move firefox cache to /tmp
[08:09] <kepler> Hanmac_, try " sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart "
[08:10] <xrs> sara copy and paste this into the terminal window: ﻿sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y boot-repair && boot-repair
[08:10] <kittenmittens> ok that instaled and im rebooting now
[08:10] <Sara> already have boot repair installed on usb
[08:10] <kepler> Hanmac_, if that doesn't work " sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start "
[08:10] <kepler> kittenmittens, good luck
[08:10] <Sara> tell me the rest please
[08:11] <xrs> open it
[08:11] <Sara> its open
[08:11] <kittenmittens> ya, this is what happened last time, i have no desktop now, no unity or anything just a blank desktop
[08:11] <linocisco> I want network monitoring tool like PRTG but should be free of charge
[08:12] <adamshumpisxxx> Anyone online who's knowledgeable with MATE?
[08:12] <Sara> xrs whats next please
[08:12] <kittenmittens> i can right click and changed desktop background adn get back to settingd from there..
[08:12] <Ben64> adamshumpisxxx: we don't support mate here
[08:12] <xrs> im installing boot repair so i can walk you through it. be warned my system is probably the slowest in this room
[08:12] <adamshumpisxxx> Well, it's MATE on Ubuntu 12.10 Netboot. Does that make a difference?
[08:12] <genoobie> okay Ben64
[08:13] <Ben64> adamshumpisxxx: nope, sorry
[08:13] <genoobie> so I changed those lines in lightdm.conf
[08:13] <genoobie> no change
[08:13] <kepler> kittenmittens, hit atl+f2 and amdcccle
[08:13] <kepler> or if you can open a terminale
[08:13] <genoobie> this sucks.
[08:13] <Hanmac_> kepler the first one does not exist on my system, the second one does, but it seems that it does not have any afffect ... moment i restart firefox
[08:13] <adamshumpisxxx> Would anyone be able to point me to an IRC server / channel that will help me?
[08:13] <kepler> sudo amdcccle
[08:13] <kittenmittens> ?
[08:13] <genoobie> I'm downloading the lubuntu desktop install
[08:13] <kittenmittens> ctrl alt t?
[08:13] <genoobie> maybe that will fix the problem
[08:14] <Sara> xrs- you there?
[08:14] <kepler> Hanmac_, not sure then. you're using the dns name and not the IP?
[08:14] <linocisco> I want network monitoring tool like PRTG but should be free of charge and full version
[08:14] <xrs> sara: im installing boot repair so i can walk you through it. be warned my system is probably the slowest in this room
[08:14] <kepler> kittenmittens, whatever opens it. im on kubuntu, so i dont know the gnome/unity shortcuts
[08:14] <Sara> ok thanks xrs
[08:15] <kittenmittens> a whole bunch of error:bad request messages in therminal
[08:15] <shortstraw8_> Sara,  What steps did you do?
[08:15] <kittenmittens> then the amd catalyst ppopped up
[08:15] <Sara> just installed bootrepair
[08:15] <Sara> now waiting for the rest
[08:15] <kepler> do you have multiple monitors?
[08:15] <aeon-ltd> adamshumpisxxx mate is default on mint right?
[08:15] <Ben64> Sara: click "recommended repair"
[08:16] <aeon-ltd> adamshumpisxxx: ask there, but don't mention you're running ubuntu
[08:16] <adamshumpisxxx> I'm not sure. I don't run Mint or have ever been interested in it.
[08:16] <adamshumpisxxx> Ah, OK. Thanks. Would you be able to link me?
[08:16] <shortstraw8_> Sara,  If you follow the rest of the steps on the ubuntu help it works fine.
[08:16] <aeon-ltd> ##mint
[08:16] <aeon-ltd> wait thats wrong
[08:16] <Sara> I have done that it recovered my win 7. you sure i need to use that again?
[08:16] <kittenmittens> what do i do now
[08:16] <kepler> kittenmittens, do you have multiple monitors?
[08:17] <adamshumpisxxx> Thanks aeon-ltd.
[08:17] <aeon-ltd> adamshumpisxxx: #linuxmint
[08:17] <Sara> I really don't like to remove my win again
[08:17] <adamshumpisxxx> Thanks...leaving now to ask.
[08:18] <xrs> you re-installed widows? are you sure win7 didnt erase your ubuntu?
[08:18] <kittenmittens> no it thought i had no monitors so i changed that now im rebooting
[08:18] <kepler> that's weird
[08:18] <Sara> I recovered mbr but not grub now I cannot install grub
[08:19] <kittenmittens> nope.. blank again
[08:19] <Ben64> Sara: Click "Recommended Repair" and do whatever it says
[08:19] <kepler> can you right click like last time?
[08:19] <Super_Dog> hey peeps.  just had a running out of disk space error.  couldn't figure out.  unmounted big server mount in fstab and all is well now.  could it be there are so many file on the mount that it is indexing them or something on my local disk....?
[08:19] <kittenmittens> ya]\
[08:19] <kepler> pop open that amdcccle again
[08:19] <Ben64> kittenmittens: do you like unity?
[08:20] <kittenmittens> ya
[08:20] <xrs> your hardware may be good, but are you sure its compatible?
[08:20] <kepler> im not sure what it is doing, but unity doesn't like it.
[08:20] <Ben64> kittenmittens: because you could use Unity 2D in 12.04
[08:20] <kittenmittens> mmh
[08:20] <Ben64> 12.10 got rid of the 2D version
[08:21] <bencc> can I install debian packages on ubuntu? which debian version to use for which ubuntu version?
[08:21] <Super_Dog> Vmware gave me a warning about trying to upgrade 12.04 to the 12.10 in my VM...
[08:21] <kittenmittens> it ndid my settings
[08:21] <kittenmittens> it wont save my option to have a monitor..
[08:22] <kepler> did you do sudo amdcccle ?
[08:22] <Super_Dog> *.deb files - double click and let software center or gdebi install...
[08:22] <xrs> ubuntu is debian, just tweaked. you can install .deb files with ubuntu software center
[08:22] <Aladeen> hello
[08:22] <kepler> i do sudo -i, too used to being root. forget to sudo all the time
[08:22] <Ben64> xrs, bencc: that is very much not recommended
[08:23] <xrs> k. i've personally never had a problem EVER
[08:23] <bencc> Ben64:  here it says that I can use the debian selinux packages https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SELinux
[08:23] <xrs> but thats just me
[08:23] <kittenmittens> now what
[08:23] <Ben64> its not good to packages for different distros
[08:23] <kepler> hit display manager
[08:23] <xrs> aww then whats alien for?  :P
[08:23] <kepler> what is your resolution and desktop area?
[08:23] <kittenmittens> sudo amdcccle again?
[08:23] <kepler> yeah
[08:23] <kepler> it should be in there
[08:23] <kittenmittens> 1920 1080
[08:24] <Super_Dog> Anybody here using their ubuntu in VMware 9.X?
[08:24] <kepler> if you put your mouse on the left side to pull up the unity bar or whatever, does it just not show up?
[08:25] <kittenmittens> no
[08:25] <kittenmittens> it wont save my settings
[08:25] <kittenmittens> getting lots of errors in the terminal from amdcccle
[08:26] <kepler> can you use paste.ubuntu.com and throw some in there?
[08:27] <Aladeen> someone have information about AladeeNUX ?
[08:28] <kittenmittens> pastebin.com/u3UBC6JV
[08:28] <kunji> kittenmittens: I have no idea if it is related or not, but isn't amdccle graphical, so you should be using gksudo not sudo.
[08:29] <xrs> i havent gotten amd drivers working since 12.10
[08:29] <kepler> i dont think those are critical. just x whining
[08:30] <kepler> kittenmittens, on 12.10, right?
[08:30] <kittenmittens> ye)ah
[08:30] <kittenmittens> no errors this time
[08:30] <kepler> what is the output of fglrxinfo ?
=== daniel is now known as Guest48356
[08:31] <chamoda> test
[08:31] <kepler> passed
[08:31] <kittenmittens> pastebin.com/s01pfVyn <this is what happened after i saved my settings though
[08:32] <kepler> well at least it was a little considerate: [xcb] Aborting, sorry about that.
[08:32] <kunji> kepler: just curious, what's the expected output for that on a good system (i.e. things working normally)?  I get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1589050/
[08:32] <kepler> that looks like mine
=== Kitar|st_ is now known as Kitar|st
[08:33] <kepler> i imagine if it doesn't work, it won't have display info/driver info there
[08:33] <kittenmittens> pastebin.com/bprTsBjN
[08:33] <kittenmittens> brb dinner
[08:33] <kepler> like that ^^
[08:34] <kunji> kepler: Hmm, well, I guess that's good then, I think my system is working fine.
[08:34] <litropy> So, I have a spare box. It's not great - it's got a 1.2 gHz processor. I already have a server. Already have a gaming comp (wouldn't be good for it anyway). I'm looking for ideas as to what to do with it.
[08:34] <kunji> litropy: super powered router?
[08:34] <kepler> haha, i think mine is too. hasn't done anything i didn't want it to yet.
[08:34] <kepler> litropy, www.pfsense.org
[08:35] <xrs> ^^
[08:35] <xrs> whatever happened to smoothwall?
[08:35] <kunji> kepler: Mine does seem a little slow, but I am running 3 monitors on an A10.. so I think that would be expected.
[08:35] <xrs> sorry rong room
[08:35] <litropy> kunji, what would it run? you're talking about using the wifi card? What advantages would it provide over my DIR-655?
[08:36] <kunji> litropy: No idea, I'm not familiar with a DIR-655 :P
[08:36] <litropy> kunji, it's jsut a nice home router https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CDUQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dlink.com%2Fproducts%2F%3Fpid%3D530&ei=hdsIUezYLubl0gHZxYG4Aw&usg=AFQjCNGBp5FopgPMO8an6BOHVAVEVEN51A&sig2=dKpqwMoIeemRW-2Qc201QA&bvm=bv.41642243,d.dmQ
[08:36] <litropy> whoops
[08:36] <litropy> http://www.dlink.com/us/en/home-solutions/connect/routers/dir-655-wireless-n-gigabit-router
[08:37] <litropy> kepler, seems like you have the same idea as kunji
[08:37] <xrs> you would get better control over the firewall and its policies, and reduce network traffix by using it as a proxy
[08:37] <xrs> you could also turn that box into a snort based intrusion detection system
[08:38] <kepler> litropy, i picked up http://goo.gl/DXJnB and run pfsense on it, disabled dhcp on my wireless router to make it an AP
[08:38] <kunji> litropy: Yeah, he was linking one way to do it.  Hmm, your own VPN would be one extra at least.
[08:38] <xrs> if you have a lot of computers, you could turn it into a proxy /  update server
[08:38] <kepler> litropy, advantage = more fun/learn?
[08:38] <kepler> i do have ipsec setup, so i vpn in from my phone and have full access to my network
[08:39] <kunji> kepler: That looks like a nice little system, yeah, it's nice being able to access my UPnP server from anywhere ^_^
[08:40] <kepler> small, quiet, and more than enough to serve me internet for the next 10 years or whatever
[08:40] <litropy> xrs, there's nothing wrond with running pfsense alongside snort on the same box, right?
[08:40] <kunji> Unfortunately I don't have the bandwidth up to stream my 1080p video though.
[08:40] <kepler> unless google fiber comes to me and they go over 1gbps, that'll hold me over
[08:40] <zayantay> hey guys
[08:40] <kunji> litropy: Yeah, that's fine
[08:40] <kepler> litropy, you can install snort as a package in pfsense
[08:41] <zayantay> helloo?
[08:41] <xrs> i've never done it but it would be better to have them seperated. checks and balences n whatnot
[08:41] <hillary_> I install eclipse via ubuntu software center but when i start i get " An error has occurred. See the log file
[08:41] <hillary_> /usr/lib/eclipse/configuration/1359535247587.log."
[08:41] <litropy> sweet, kepler
[08:41] <zayantay> any body here
[08:41] <kunji> !ask | zayantay
[08:41] <ubottu> zayantay: Please don't ask to ask a question, simply ask the question (all on ONE line and in the channel, so that others can read and follow it easily). If anyone knows the answer they will most likely reply. :-) See also !patience
[08:41] <hillary_> i had purge the eclipse juno i install by hand
[08:41] <hillary_> could it be there are some remains?
[08:42] <zayantay> where can i find help for penetration testing. please tell me a channel or ?
[08:42] <kunji> Hmm, not sure if that's exactly what I wanted the bot to say... I keep forgetting the calls, was there a more appropriate one?
[08:42] <hillary_> how can i get rid of them?
[08:42] <xrs> #backtrack
[08:42] <xrs> @ zayantay
[08:42] <zayantay> thanks but is there a channel for backbox ?
[08:42] <xrs> theres like 15 security rooms in freenode
[08:43] <Hanmac_> kepler i found the cupit ... its the VM (the server) when the VM is down, FF says cant find "xyz.local" but when the VM is up, it says cant find "abc.local" ... i removed everything from the hosts, the vhost is disabled too, i tryed all methods for dns-cleaning but it does still happening :(
[08:43] <zayantay> ok thanks ill check that out :)
[08:43] <kunji> zayantay: Probably... but you want to do pentesting when you can't even find that yourself?  .... script kiddies....
[08:43] <xrs> knowledge is power...
[08:43] <zayantay> sry man
[08:43] <xrs> just so long as ur pen testing your own equipment
[08:44] <zayantay> im new to linux
[08:44] <zayantay> in a way
[08:44] <zayantay> i tried mint for a while though
[08:44] <xrs> im new to linux n ive been using it since the 90s  :P
[08:44] <zayantay> cool
[08:44] <kepler> Hanmac_, i think im not understanding the whole problem. you have a vm host that has two VMs on it that only are accessible while the other is down?
[08:45] <kunji> xrs: That's why I don't like pointing people places for pen testing... it's usually not their own equipment, 9 times out of 10 it's someone looking to break wireless passwords to get free wifi -_-
[08:45] <hillary_> ubuntu 12.04
[08:46] <Hanmac_> kepler its one VM with two vhosts ... (now only one active vhost) ... and i act access this vhost because it try to redirect to an non-existing vhost
[08:46] <kurisutian> Hi there! Can anyone help me getting convirt to work? I wanted to set up a web managed kvm server but somehow convirt won't work. Packages are installed but after that it refuses to work....
[08:47] <kepler> Hamled, i'm not sure :/ sorry
[08:47] <litropy> xrs, kunji, zayantay, Ya. And in that case, it's worth mentioning that doing so is a felony in the US.
[08:47] <litropy> US at least ...
[08:48] <xrs> Yeah just ask Aaron Swartz
[08:48] <litropy> Not to be *that guy*
[08:48] <kittenmittens> back
[08:48] <hillary_> any help?
[08:49] <kepler> kittenmittens, that last paste shows that the driver isn't working for whatever reason
=== jolaren_ is now known as apa

[08:49] <kittenmittens> so what should i do
[08:49] <genoobie> paly
[08:49] <genoobie> okay
[08:49] <kepler> kittenmittens, do " sudo apt-get remove --purge fglrx " to get rid of the driver
[08:49] <kunji> litropy: indeed
[08:49] <kepler> hopefully it boots up like it did
[08:49] <genoobie>  I mean I am done with *nix on  this older machine
[08:49] <apish> I know that I use "rsync -avz -e ssh /home/ramesh/ ramesh@192.168.200.10:/backup/ramesh/" in order to sync local folder to remote folder.. but what if i want to sync remote folder to local?
[08:49] <genoobie> xp runs fine
[08:49] <genoobie> done

[08:51] <litropy> apish, ssh to the remote and then rsync?
[08:52] <kepler> kittenmittens, after you boot back up, get a terminal again and try this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/124292/what-is-the-correct-way-to-install-ati-catalyst-video-drivers-fglrx
[08:54] <xrs> well that explains why my video never worked after 12.10... i hate amd

[09:35] <kepler> it is just a script to do the installs
[09:36] <kittenmittens> thats what the website says to do, ill try yours
[09:36] <kepler> looks like that one is the same as the fglrx we tried before, but adding using sudo amdconfig --initial
[09:36] <kepler> which may be what fixes it

[09:42] <ubottu> brontosaurusrex: Package iconv does not exist in quantal
[09:42] <somsip> brontosaurusrex: man iconv and see if it helps
[09:43] <brontosaurusrex> isnt iconv only for charset conversions?
[09:43] <kittenmittens> after all that do i continue to step 3 or am i done then?
[09:43] <llutz> brontosaurusrex: "iconv - Convert encoding of given files from one encoding to another"

[10:30] <bartzy> Hey
[10:30] <bartzy> if I use 12.10 , and PHP version there is X for example
[10:30] <bartzy> for example 5.4.6
[10:30] <bartzy> and then PHP releases PHP 5.5
[10:30] <bartzy> the repo will update to php 5.5 ?
[10:30] <dr_willis> !latest
[10:30] <ubottu> Packages in Ubuntu may not be the latest. Ubuntu aims for stability, so "latest" may not be a good idea. Post-release updates are only considered if they are fixes for security vulnerabilities, high impact bug fixes, or unintrusive bug fixes with substantial benefit. See also !backports, !sru, and !ppa.
[10:30] <bartzy> Or will stay at 5.4.6 forever, with just security patches (like debian) ?
[10:30] <dr_willis> bartzy:  possible, but not likely
[10:31] <bartzy> So exactly like debian stable /
[10:31] <bartzy> Same policy give or take ?
[10:31] <dr_willis> theres backports and ppas if yoiu need newer
[10:31] <bartzy> Cool.
[10:31] <bartzy> And this is the same for all ubuntu releases ?
[10:31] <bartzy> 12.04, 12.10, 13.04 ?
[10:31] <dr_willis> yes
[10:31] <bartzy> Or there is a "Testing" version where the packages update , like debian wheezy/sid ?
[10:31] <dr_willis> bartzy:  no 'testing'
[10:32] <Ray> Hello, im trying to install TrueCombat Elite on ubuntu 12.04, when i extract/install it from Term, it is looking for Wolfenstein, is wolfenstein needed..???
[10:32] <bobweaver> bartzy,  not really there are pure "Ubuntu developers"  that both do Ubuntu patchs and also debian or just Ubuntu thus sometimes thing make it into Ubuntu stuff but that is not looked up to that much
[10:32] <bobweaver> bartzy,  what is stoping you from installing "what you want to use ? "
[10:32] <bartzy> dr_willis: So how packages getting upgraded in major versions ? i.e. php5.4 to php 5.5 ? Just in new releases, i.e. 13.04 to 13.10 ?
[10:32] <shomon> where can I get help with soap web services? sorry if that's OT here...
[10:32] <dr_willis> bartzy:  you got it.
[10:33] <litropy> bobweaver, I think he's trying to get a grasp of how Ubuntu manages their packages.
[10:33] <bobweaver> ahh
[10:33] <dr_willis> every 6 mo  stuff gets updated.. in most cases
[10:33] <alimj> Sorry if this is a dumb but however I could change GIMP interface language?
[10:33] <bobweaver> unless there is a security patch or something big is needed. correct
[10:33] <dr_willis> but even then - it may not be the absolute latest
[10:33] <bobweaver> dr_willis,  about 6 months behind ?
[10:34] <alimj> I mean How could I change GIMP interface language?
[10:34] <dr_willis> i never worry about the vversions. ;)
[10:34] <litropy> dr_willis, so packages will never get upgradd to newer versions if I keep the same Ubunu release?
[10:34] <litropy> upgraded*
[10:34] <dr_willis> !latest
[10:34] <blunted> Newest upstart produces odd error with HDD devices, what's the proper way of reporting it?
[10:34] <litropy> Sorry for the typos peeps - I'm tired.
[10:34] <Ray> Hello, im trying to install TrueCombat Elite on ubuntu 12.04, when i extract/install it from Term, it is looking for Wolfenstein, is wolfenstein needed..???
[10:34] <bobweaver> alimj,  you can change the language for all programs under gnome-control-center -> language's
[10:35] <dr_willis> normally only security updates get  updated topackage.. some times secirity fixs get ported back to older packages
[10:35] <Ben64> Ray: doesn't seem like an ubuntu issue, ask the truecombat people?
[10:35] <litropy> dr_willis, thx
[10:35] <bartzy> dr_willis: So what is the difference between the main repository, and the security repository ?
[10:35] <Ray> Ben64 : Probably
[10:35] <litropy> Alrighty. Goodnight, peeps.
[10:36] <dr_willis> bartzy:  no idea. i rarely worry about such things
[10:36] <bartzy> ok, thanks. Anyone knows why there is a security repo and a main repo ?
[10:37] <bobweaver> bartzy,  main is the "main"  security is push from CVT's
[10:37] <bobweaver> like if there is a report bartzy  of some CVE then fixs can go to that also kernel fixs and stuff like that
[10:38] <bobweaver> kinda
[10:38] <bobweaver> bartzy if you like things like that Today is part of Ubuntu Developers week in #ubuntu-classroom
[10:40] <MoL0ToV> there are a guide to make a ubuntu network with shared net fs and centralized user auth on login?

Can this new username be like root? if so how to? or can I add this user to the root group?
=== sharky2 is now known as sharky
[10:43] <Ben64> SAngeli: you should look into vhosts
[10:44] <dr_willis> SAngeli:  i think you add them to the www group.. but i  alwo thought www should be owned by the  www group.   but i am only rembering what otheers have said iin here in the past

[10:49] <ActionParsnip> GoodHand_: what is the issue?
[10:50] <GoodHand_> How to do it!
[10:50] <SAngeli> dr_willis, also the gruup name is root root as listed above.
[10:50] <ActionParsnip> GoodHand_: do you have the app installed?
[10:51] <dr_willis> root.root for owning www seems odd..  but i dont manage web servers ;)
[10:51] <Ben64> SAngeli: sounds very insecure. you should really look into a better system. ssh/scp/rsync and vhosts

[10:52] <SAngeli> moreover it is only on the /www  so not much security issue.
[10:52] <SAngeli> this is only for the web server for developing websites locally

[10:58] <GoodHand_> GeniusBrain: Bye!
[10:58] <GeniusBrain> GoodHand_: do you have the app installed?
[10:59] <ActionParsnip> GoodHand_: run the app, when it shows in the Unity launcher, right click it and select to lock it.
[10:59] <GeniusBrain> Problem with add app in python to left bar
[10:59] <Ben64> you could set /var/www to 777 and/or change owner, then have it shared with samba with no permissions
[10:59] <GeniusBrain> Moreover it is only on the /www so not much security issue
[11:00] <raven_> ive got an issue.. i have a laptop and pc, and i need to install windows on my pc but it has no dvd drive, and my usb is only 2 gigs.. is it possible to use a harddrive as like a usb?

=== temptation is now known as Guest55251
=== nuxninja is now known as Firetux
[11:00] <Ben64> GeniusBrain: stop
[11:00] <GeniusBrain> Ben64: yeah
[11:01] <SAngeli> Ben64, no change owner. I could change group but is there a way I can add a user to root group? I ask this because if I am correct when I list /var/www I get drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  which tells me that the owner is "root" but also that the group is "root". Am I right?
[11:01] <Ben64> SAngeli: why not change owner?
[11:01] <fig> use Wubi, you can install Ubuntu with no DVD over your Windows installation
[11:01] <SAngeli> Ben64, because I do not know if this would have any impact on Apache running. Also, I have a differne case too. So
[11:02] <lombardo> SAngeli: change group doing this: chown sangeli.users /var/www/file
[11:02] <Ben64> SAngeli: it wouldn't affect apache
[11:02] <SAngeli> I wish to know if I can add sangeli to root group or similar
[11:02] <SAngeli> can I do so?
[11:02] <Ben64> you cannot
[11:02] <GeniusBrain> SAngeli: do you have the app installed?
[11:02] <SAngeli> So, my last resort is to access the share as root
[11:02] <SAngeli> I can do so, right?
[11:02] <Ben64> no
[11:02] <GeniusBrain> You can install Ubuntu with no DVD over your Windows installation
[11:03] <SAngeli> :-(
[11:03] <Ben64> i've already given you a solution
[11:03] <GeniusBrain> Possible to use a harddrive as like
[11:03] <lombardo> SAngeli: root group is wheel... if you want to add sangeli to wheel group, i think you need to do: usermod -g wheel sangeli
[11:03] <SAngeli> Ben64, here is another example: I wish to rwx on /var/log. I cannot go around the system and start changing ownership like I wish.
[11:04] <fig> The nice thing about using Wubi is you can access your Windows files as if they're in just another file
[11:04] <SAngeli> lombardo, thanks
[11:04] <SAngeli> I will try
[11:04] <fig> folder*
[11:04] <SAngeli> lombardo, it does not exist as group
[11:05] <Ben64> SAngeli: i've already given you a solution....
[11:05] <GeniusBrain> Like a usb?
[11:05] <SAngeli> Ben64, Ok, I get it.
[11:05] <lombardo> SAngeli: you sure?  look in /etc/groups .. is no wheel?
[11:05] <Ben64> lombardo: not on ubuntu/debian
[11:05] <GeniusBrain> Does not exist as group
[11:05] <lombardo> SAngeli: cat /etc/group

[11:06] <fig> I know, but it's really fast
[11:06] <lombardo> SAngeli: well then add your user to root group
[11:06] <GeniusBrain> I can do so, right click it and select to lock

[11:07] <GeniusBrain> Pc, and I need to see this as a file folder inside my PC
[11:07] <SAngeli> lombardo, which is the root group? is it admin?
[11:07] <ActionParsnip> Ben64: have you used:  !ops
[11:07] <hillary_> GeniusBrain,  hi
[11:07] <lombardo> SAngeli: root group is also called root
[11:07] <Ben64> i'm in #ubuntu-ops
[11:07] <GeniusBrain> hillary_: root group or similar
[11:07] <ActionParsnip> fig: what is fast?
[11:07] <hillary_> GeniusBrain, similar
[11:07] <GeniusBrain> hillary_: you sure? look in /etc/groups
[11:07] <fig> using Wubi rather than checking another harddrive partition
[11:08] <Ben64> hillary_: ignore GeniusBrain
[11:08] <GeniusBrain> Ben64: How to do it!
[11:08] <BrixSat> Morning
[11:08] <ActionParsnip> fig: its not really fast, a true install will be faster as it doesn't get affected by the shortcomings in NTFS
[11:08] <fig> you can browse videos for instance quickly

[11:11] <Ben64> hillary_: well the error says it all. you have a duplicate source
[11:11] <hillary_> Ben64,  yes how can i correct it please
[11:11] <ActionParsnip> fig: no, I just understand how NTFS degrades over time, this affects the wubi disk file directly
[11:12] <ActionParsnip> fig: Journalised file systems do not degrade nearly as much so is a much better option in that sense

[11:12] <lombardo> hillary_: just comment it out if there is a duplicate there
[11:12] <ActionParsnip> fig: the ONLY good thing about Wubi imho is that the host partition is mapped automagically for you, otherwise the fact that wubi is so fragile makes it not suitable for long term use
[11:12] <GeniusBrain> I do so?
[11:12] <GeniusBrain> I have a duplicate there
[11:13] <ActionParsnip> fig: and fixing it is far from easy via liveCD (mount ntfs, loop mount wubi file etc).

[11:18] <RajneshSiwal1> I need to migrate from OpenLDAP to Zentyal
[11:18] <RajneshSiwal1> There are some additional schemas that we have added to it
[11:18] <RajneshSiwal1> It includes samba, Password Policy and sudoers
[11:19] <Super_Dog> woww....  out of my league there.  I just got lucky and figured out how to make my little Atom server blades run some file sharing LAN server on Zentyal...
[11:19] <Super_Dog> That's about all I'm doing with Zentyal right now...
[11:19] <RajneshSiwal1> You should use it as an AD (PDC) it supports even GPOs
[11:20] <Super_Dog> what's a GPO?
[11:20] <RajneshSiwal1> Integrating both Linux and Windows Environment
[11:20] <lombardo> Super_Dog: it is GPU spelled wrong
[11:20] <RajneshSiwal1> GPO: Group Policies implementation in Windows Environment
[11:20] <RajneshSiwal1> As in Active Directory
[11:20] <Super_Dog> Did you lose the "O" somewhere?
[11:21] <Super_Dog> I see the "G" and the "P"...

[11:21] <awisepilot> Can anyone help with KVM?

[11:33] <jnhghy> does anybody know how to install adobe acrobat reader in ubuntu 12.04 64bit? I tried adding the ppa also downloading the .bin, .deb, .rpm from the adobe site all had issues. anybody has a solution that want's to share?
[11:33] <hillary_> dr_willis, hi, Kindly assist me with a command that will allow me to write into a root folder
[11:33] <ronin_1977> hi
[11:34] <Ben64> jnhghy: do you really need adobe's? ubuntu comes with a pdf reader by default
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: mark the .bin file as executable and run it using sudo
[11:34] <ActionParsnip> hillary_: do you use a GUI OS?
[11:35] <ronin_1977> i need some information about video converter in linux
[11:35] <hillary_> dr_willis,  i want to alter a file in /etc/apt/sourcelist.txt ubuntu 12.04 is my os yes
[11:35] <ActionParsnip> hillary_: gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sourcelist.txt
[11:35] <jnhghy> Ben64: I can't use evince because with some of my pdf's when I try to print I get inverted colors (even in print preview)
[11:36] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: use terminal, lots easier
[11:36] <ronin_1977> i have ubuntu 12.10 , and download i little program called soun converter , but this program not work very well
[11:36] <jnhghy> ActionParsnip: I made the .bin file executable and tried to run it but I get error message "No such file or directory"
[11:36] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: then you need to change directory to where the file is held
[11:36] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: you will also need to prefix the file with ./  as pwd is not in $PATH
[11:37] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: so use:  sudo ./Acrobat.bin    or whatever the file name is
[11:37] <ronin_1977> soundconverter dont convert all files in the list . His stopped in the middle of task
[11:37] <jnhghy> ActionParsnip: I did, then I typed only a few letters of the name of the pack and then hit "tab" and it founded the file .... so I'm giving the right command in the right place but still get the error, yes with ./ in front :)
[11:38] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: try using absolute path. Eg:  sudo /home/$USER/filename.bin
[11:38] <Super_Dog> jinghy:  I installed from Medibuntu repository  quite easily...    http://www.medibuntu.org/
[11:39] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: I assume you used:  chown +x /home/$USER/filename.bin    to mark executable
[11:39] <jnhghy> ActionParsnip: I ended up thinking it's an issue with the program running on 64bit is this not plausible?
[11:39] <ActionParsnip> jnhghy: possibly, i've not used acrobat reader, let me see
[11:39] <Super_Dog> Just downloaded the font package and it gave me reader, too...
[11:39] <jnhghy> ActionParsnip: thanks for the time, I'll try with absolute path.... if that won't work I'll try Super_dog solution. Thanks both...
[11:40] <Super_Dog> May not be the latest and greatest at medibuntu but it worked for me....

[13:13] <drakonmane> I want to speak germen
[13:13] <ioria> histo: I also installed gnome and in gnome i can :+
[13:13] <MonkeyDust> drakonmane  type /join #ubuntu-de
[13:13] <histo> ioria: can you explain a little more perhaps I don't understand what you are doing.
[13:14] <GoodHand_> Hi all!
[13:14] <histo> GoodHand_: Do you have a ubuntu related question?
[13:14] <ioria> histo: ok, sorry. i open gnome-terminal and a file with an url inside (ex. URL=file:///home/ioria/hello) and it opens with gedit
[13:15] <GoodHand_> Yes
[13:15] <GoodHand_> How to add Sublime text 2 (python app) to left bar
[13:15] <histo> ioria: How are you "opening" the file with a url in it?
[13:15] <ioria> histo: but in lubuntu nothing happens

[13:16] <jnhghy> I have a hdd that has ubuntu 12.04 with a lot of software that got removed(including network-manager) at this point I have that hdd in this computer that also has ubuntu 12.04. at this point I see 2 options: 1 I download and copy the missing packages and try to install them after I put the hdd back in it's computer or I reinstall the os-that brings me to a new question: if I reinstall the os can I simply copy paste the current profile? will it use the exi
[13:16] <jnhghy> sting config files? or is this out of the question?
[13:16] <GoodHand_> thx
[13:16] <ioria> histo: you create a file with inside written: URL=file:///home/user/filename
[13:17] <histo> jnhghy: Why not just copy everything with rsync? Or dd
[13:17] <blackshirt> hello, what is the website http://packages.ubuntu.com written with ?
[13:17] <jnhghy> histo: copying everything? what do you mean?
[13:18] <histo> jnhghy: Your question doesn't really makse sense.  Do you have two hdd's or one?  Are you trying to transfer data?
[13:19] <histo> blackshirt: looks like html to me
[13:19] <kunji> histo: ioria is referring to what is shown in the Location bar in Nautilus I think.  Hmm, I've never tried reaching something that way on the command line.
[13:20] <kunji> histo: Well, there's something like that syntax for Browse Network, I don't remember seeing it anywhere else though
[13:20] <ioria> kunji: no wait.... :-(  i'd like to open a file url in gnome terminal but i can't in lubuntu... but i CAN in gnome... why that ?
[13:20] <jnhghy> I'm very sorry if my question doesn't make sens, I'll try elaborate. I said I have a hdd with issues (I removed a lot of softwares from it) at this point that hdd is a slave in a nother computer(the computer I am using now) the data was not affected but I need a solution to fix the os on the hdd that has issues if the best way is to reinstall then I need also a solution to copy the config/customization files with apropriate rights....
[13:20] <histo> jnhghy: I don't know how else to say that for it to make sense.  Copying all your data.
[13:21] <histo> kunji: yeah smb://server  in nautilus
[13:21] <histo> ioria: and how do you open said file in terminal?
[13:21] <histo> jnhghy: rsync <<
[13:22] <histo> jnhghy: and What sort of issues do you mean?
[13:22] <kunji> ioria: That's just it, I don't know what you mean by a file url... files don't have urls, except I think for files on the network rather than on your machine.  Just what file are you trying to access?
[13:22] <jnhghy> histo: you told me a solutin then you ask me what I mean? does it make sens?
[13:22] <ioria> histo: if you write in gnome-terminal "URL=file:///home/user/filename" and you move your mouse over it it's highlighted
[13:22] <histo> Am I crazy or is everyone in here not making sense right now?
[13:22] <histo> jnhghy: rsync can copy your configs
[13:23] <kunji> histo: you're not crazy, I'm as confused as you are
[13:23] <histo> jnhghy: I originally thought you wanted to copy your entire drive. So I was saying you could use rsync or dd
[13:23] <blackshirt> histo: where i can get the source code for it ? is it freely available ?
[13:23] <ioria> histo: and right click you can choose "open link"
[13:23] <jnhghy> histo: thanks for this info, and the new os will use those config files? I need to use the same username? or how will it tell?
[13:23] <histo> blackshirt: right click view source
[13:24] <ioria> histo: and the file opens
[13:24] <kunji> ioria: The highlighting means nothing significant, I think it's just picking up on the syntax with : and // and thinking it's an http url.
[13:24] <histo> ioria: Okay well you can't right click on a file in gnome-terminal . So maybe you mean nautilus file browser.
[13:24] <usr13> histo: You're not crazy
[13:24] <ioria> histo: uffi ....
[13:25] <histo> ioria: uffi?
[13:25] <histo> wth
[13:25] <Ben64> actually, gnome-terminal does parse links and lets you click them
[13:25] <ioria> histo: it's a distress call :-)
[13:25] <usr13> Ben64: Yea, but it just copies the text; Right?
[13:25] <histo> Ben64: how is he even seeing the link if it's in a file in a terminal. He still hasn't explained that.
[13:25] <ioria> Ben64: thank you :-)
[13:26] <ioria> Ben64: you're my man
[13:26] <kunji> histo: You're not crazy yet, but by the end of today... :P
[13:26] <Kartagis> has anybody been experiencing an excessive system load when Chrome is running (not chromium)?
[13:26] <Ben64> usr13: nope; histo: it's not a file, he meant the link just in the terminal
[13:26] <kunji> histo: umm, maybe in a man page?  But I think it would be to a website not a file.
[13:26] <histo> Kartagis: chrome is a memory hog
[13:26] <PioneerAxon> Hey all, I recently started experiencing a new problem with the wireless hotspot. :/
[13:26] <histo> kunji: what?
[13:27] <Kartagis> histo: should I go back to chromium? it's flash-buggy
[13:27] <PioneerAxon> The machines can only connect when I have the network open (no security).
[13:27] <histo> Kartagis: chromium should have the same behavior
[13:28] <Kartagis> histo: so only option left for me is ff?
[13:28] <Jpmh> Kartagis: yes - chrome is horrible if you do not have a boatload of memory
[13:28] <PioneerAxon> One is running Ubuntu 12.10 (with intel 5100 chip) and another on 12.04 (with bcmw 4313).
[13:28] <Kartagis> Jpmh: 2gb
[13:28] <Jpmh> Kartagis: midori seems very low profile
[13:28] <histo> Kartagis: that's plenty of memory. There are lighter browsers though if that is your concern
[13:29] <kunji> histo: Well, for instance if you do man ls and scroll down to the Reporting Bugs section, there are urls to websites.  That's just about the only place I can think of where you would see urls in the terminal.  Well, or in web dev stuff.
[13:29] <usr13> If we want to [regularly] access a samba share on another [Linux] PC, it's probably easiest to set it up as an nfs share, and you can mount it on the local [Linux] PC as /home/user/samba-share or something like that.
[13:29] <Jpmh> Kartagis: 2gb with unity is probably not enough
[13:29] <Kartagis> Jpmh: cairo-dock
[13:30] <Jpmh> Kartagis: what?
[13:30] <ioria> Ben64: i can open 'URL=http:///www.google.com' but i can't open 'URL=file:///home/ioria/myfile' in lubuntu. But in gnome i can... do you know something about that ? please
[13:31] <PioneerAxon> Anyone?
[13:31] <kunji> ioria: Yeah, it parses links, I said that already, but files are not "links" per se.  So is it a link, or a file?  Can you screenshot this for us and paste it?
[13:31] <usr13> .... that's the way I'd do it....  Because there is nothing wrong with having a samba share also set up as an nfs share.  It's very convenient, (especially if you want to access it and manipulate the files via CLI.)
[13:31] <histo> PioneerAxon: How are you trying to connect when security is enabled?
[13:31] <Kartagis> Jpmh: I'm using cairo-dock
[13:31] <Ben64> ioria: use gnome? or don't use weird file links in a terminal
[13:31] <PioneerAxon> histo: Just as I normally did, host the hotspot on the first machine (12.10) and then connect with second (12.04)
[13:32] <ioria> Ben64: come again , plese ?
[13:32] <histo> PioneerAxon: You mean an ad hoc network?
[13:32] <Ben64> ioria: use gnome? or don't use weird file links in a terminal
[13:32] <Jpmh> Kartagis: never tried it
[13:32] <PioneerAxon> histo: I had the networks working a day back.. Then suddenly it won't connect, so I had tried different things, and found out that the only problem is with security.. :/
[13:33] <ioria> Ben64: i'm on lubuntu, but installed also gnome (in another session) and the link it's a link to a text file
[13:33] <PioneerAxon> histo: Yeah ad-hoc. Hosted by hotspot on 12.10
[13:33] <Ben64> ioria: why are you using links like that in a terminal? theres no good reason for it
[13:33] <xiaoy> Which is the ubuntu equivalent for  perl-Net-SSLeay.i686 perl-IO-Socket-SSL pkgs?
[13:33] <kunji> ioria: Is there a reason for wanting to use that format?  Why not just use the path to the file?
[13:34] <valentina> Olá.?
[13:34] <kunji> ioria: Or what's wrong with using a symlink?
[13:34] <MonkeyDust> xiaoy  what is it supposed to do?

[13:35] <MonkeyDust> xiaoy  ubuntu server? if yes, they have their own channel #ubuntu-server
[13:35] <ioria> Ben64: you know that Lubuntu has not recent files menu so i parsed with xbel_parse the recently-used.xbel file and so i got all the files i used ... but i want be able to open them immediatly and in gnome i can but not in lubuntu
[13:36] <xiaoy> MonkeyDust, tkz going ;)

[13:37] <ioria> Ben64: the output of recently-used.xbel file is formed by links .... and i want to be able to open them
[13:37] <PioneerAxon> histo: This happened after I tried and failed to set up the hostapd network on the 12.10 machine.. I have reverted everything I ever did for that..
[13:37] <Ben64> ioria: then use gnome
[13:37] <ioria> Ben64: very smart answer :P
[13:38] <Ben64> well yeah, if lxde doesn't do what you want and gnome does, why try to force a square peg into a round hole
[13:38] <ioria> Ben64: gnome already has a recent file menu :)
[13:38] <Ben64> problem solved!
[13:38] <kunji> Ben64: Because the other peg is a triangle?

[13:40] <ioria> Ben64:    ^o^
[13:42] <histo> ioria: it most likely doesn't work because pcmanfm is the default file manager in lxde
[13:42] <histo> ioria: as apposed to nautilus
[13:42] <PioneerAxon> histo: I am already using the network manager method.. I just can't connect if I set up a password.. This works fine with open network... It used to work before a day.. Strange...
[13:42] <usr13> I set thunar to View as Detailed List and toggle Name up or down and Date Modified up or down.
[13:42] <ioria> histo: i think you're right
[13:42] <ioria> histo: so ?
[13:43] <histo> ioria: So change the default file manager to nautilus
[13:43] <ioria> histo: i have to change the file manager ?
[13:43] <usr13> ioria: Or try thunar
[13:43] <ioria> histo: i used thunar in xfce

[13:56] <usr13> nyRednek: installer for what?
[13:57] <Chiko> trying to remember a program that lets you connect to a ubuntu instance sort of like mstsc/rdp for windows
[13:58] <Chiko> ah nvm tightvnc
[13:59] <histo>  │                          | wifi with
[13:59] <histo> Chiko: rdesktop
[13:59] <usr13> nyRednek: Can you rephrase your question and add more detail?
[13:59] <histo> Chiko: is for windows. vino or tightvnc for vnc connections in linux
[14:00] <usr13> l057c0d3r: lxde  uses lxnm for network manager which is not fully functional, but you can install network-manager and use that.
[14:00] <histo> usr13: or wicd
[14:01] <usr13> l057c0d3r: Yes, as histo points out, there is also wicd
[14:01] <histo> usr13: nvm
[14:01] <nyRednek> usr13, i'm attempting to make a custom livecd without an "install" option
[14:01] <nyRednek> usr13, so which package would i remove from the cd?
[14:01] <l057c0d3r> usr13, i just no it worked better on the live cd then it did after being installed to the system.. i found a workaround and it works just fine for me now though..  but thanks for the advice.. i'll keep them options in mind
[14:01] <usr13> l057c0d3r: wicd may be your best choice while in lxde

I ask this as when I changed the password for the user when I typed sudo -s I had to use the same user password. Can comeone please explain?
[14:07] <usr13> nyRednek: I dono, is it apt-install?

[14:08] <ubottu> SAngeli: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo

[14:15] <nyRednek> usr13, booting into a livecd to see
[14:15] <hick12> hi everybody :) could I ask a quick question about the Ubuntu Windows Installer? Basically I just downloaded it on my laptop and installed it expecting the Windows bootloaders to come up when booting. Instead it jumps right into Ubuntu. Is there a way to get it to boot into the bootloader or do I have to restore the old master boot sector effectively prohibiting me from booting into Ubuntu?
[14:16] <usr13> nyRednek: Yea, just right click on the install icon and see what it says in properties.
[14:16] <usr13> ... should give the command name...
[14:17] <usr13> and test it from terminal.  And then see where it is.  which cdrominstall  or something....
[14:17] <usr13> but the command name is more than likely the app name as well, (I would suppose).

[14:50] <mathi> hey
[14:51] <mathi> when I start my computer, sometimes I get a menu with blackground, to chose generic, recovery mode, etc.
[14:51] <OTI> hello, i upgraded 12.04 to 12.10 and now my internet connection refuses to work. the top right icon says i'm online but i can't open any pages with browser nor ping via terminal
[14:51] <OTI> wired connection, now wlan
[14:51] <mathi> as I didn't have any screen, i couldn't chose, I would like my computer to chose the first entry always
[14:51] <OTI> not wlan, sorry
[14:52] <nyRednek> blami: whatever works
[14:52] <mathi> like on windows, when it prompts how to start the computer (normal mode, recovery, ...) there is a timer
[14:52] <mathi> I need the same thing
[14:52] <ThinkT510> mathi: it should already do that by default

=== Guest18048 is now known as tm
[14:55] <mathi> thank you
[14:55] <histo> mathi: if you have a look in the /etc/default/grub  file you can set the timeout
[14:56] <histo> mathi: it's the grub boot menu
[14:56] <y2j> ok i have 64gb ssd for ubutnu, 256 for winodws 8 64bit enterprise and another 1tb for some winodws 8 progarms im going to add 2 3tb hard drives in raid
[14:56] <y2j> how do i tranfer all of the 1tb stuff to one of the 3tb hard drives so i can take the 1tb out and all the prgrams will work on the 3tb
[14:56] <y2j> then raid the 3tb with the other 3tb
[14:57] <jhutchins_wk> y2j: Build the raid first.
[14:57] <mathi> histo: in grub file I have "GRUB_TIMEOUT=10", but i promess you it was waiting forever and it wasnt showing any time counter
[14:57] <y2j> jhutchins_wk: When i install the 2 3tb i dont want it to break the mbr
[14:57] <y2j> it always does
[14:57] <histo> y2j: rsync -av source destination
[14:58] <y2j> ok build the raid
[14:58] <histo> mathi: change it and make sure you update-grub
[14:58] <nils_> mathi: it could be that grub recorded some sort of failure, which will cause it to not use a timeout
[14:58] <y2j> how about moving the 1tb data to the 3tb hd?
=== anoland_ks_ is now known as anoland
[14:58] <mathi> nils_:  how do I force it to use the timeout *in any case*
[14:58] <y2j> as the 1tb is f: drive the new 3tb has to become f otherwise windows registry will not open the files on the 3tb?
[14:59] <dw-> easier questions, plz
[14:59] <y2j> i use the 1tb for programs that dont need speed, so the 256ssd has some breathing room
[14:59] <nils_> mathi: I just read up on that very problem today, it should be sufficient to set GRUB_RECORDFAIL_TIMEOUT  in /etc/default/grub then do update-grub

To use GNOME Shell instead of Unity, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".

[15:48] <histo> !notunity | phoenixsampras
[15:48] <ubottu> phoenixsampras: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[15:49] <phoenixsampras> core i7 vaio
[15:49] <ActionParsnip> phoenixsampras: if your CPU has a sandy/ivy bridge, then its switchable
[15:50] <l057c0d3r> ActionParsnip, heh now you lost me too :-p
[15:50] <phoenixsampras> ActionParsnip: how to know if its sandy?
[15:50] <histo> l057c0d3r: some laptops can switch between the sandy bridge display and nvidia to save power.
[15:51] <phoenixsampras> oh, then i suppose is switchable
[15:51] <l057c0d3r> oh
[15:51] <phoenixsampras> however, where is restricted drivers are available. ?

[15:52] <histo> phoenixsampras: What docs?
[15:52] <l057c0d3r> phoenixsampras, go to software center..  click properties / settings...  click software sources tab..
[15:52] <histo> l057c0d3r: doesn't need to do that for nvidia drivers.
[15:52] <ActionParsnip> phoenixsampras: you can also check with:  sudo lshw -C display     if you see an Intel GPU too, then its switchable
[15:52] <ThinkT510> phoenixsampras: ubuntu isn't that great at keeping the wiki up to date

[15:58] <threex5> nevermind
[15:58] <ActionParsnip> vlt: which email client?
[15:58] <ikonia> vlt: you'll need your MTA to do that, or your delivery agent to do it
[15:58] <histo> ikonia: How is dnsmasq configured then?
[15:58] <ikonia> histo: it's very annoying
[15:58] <phoenixsampras> quantal is the god of cows for mexicans?

[15:59] <ActionParsnip> l057c0d3r: funky, its not a massive overhead which is a bonus
[15:59] <ikonia> histo: it points all your requests via librsolver to 127.0.1.1, then runs dnsmasq on that local address
[15:59] <ikonia> histo: that I don't know without looking

[15:59] <histo> ikonia: yeah resolvconf  is still installed
[16:00] <ikonia> histo: still used though
[16:00] <histo> ikonia: you can still specify nameservers in /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
[16:00] <ActionParsnip> OTI: does my command help?
[16:00] <ikonia> histo: mega
[16:00] <l057c0d3r> ActionParsnip, yeah.. i love lubuntu..  but it has tons of glitches with it..  network manager error... (simple workaround) sound error (simple workaround)..  now this messenger service.....  but oh well..  easier then my gentoo/fluxbox setup i use on my desktop to maintain though
[16:00] <vlt> ActionParsnip: Completely undefined. If possible I would like a non GUI solution. Is there a cli email client that can hold a connection to an IMAP account and instantly react (like Thunderbird does)?
[16:00] <histo> ikonia: mega?
[16:00] <threex5> actually, I do have a question: In gnome, alt+right-click used to resize windows but it doesn't work in gnome fallback. is there a way to bring this back
[16:00] <threex5> ?
[16:00] <ikonia> histo: "great"
[16:01] <histo> l057c0d3r: /j #lubuntu
[16:01] <threex5> also it would be nice to program other key commands but this isn't in preferences anymore
[16:01] <ActionParsnip> vlt: there is gmail watcher (similar for generic emails) and you can tell it to run a command and make a noise on new emails
[16:01] <vlt> ActionParsnip: Sounds great
[16:01] <histo> vlt: mutt
[16:02] <ActionParsnip> histo:  /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head is generated (cat the file)
[16:02] <histo> vlt: although what do you mean by instantly react?
[16:02] <histo> ActionParsnip: No it isn't
[16:02] <histo> ActionParsnip: That's the head of the /etc/resolv.conf  file
[16:02] <ActionParsnip> histo: cat the file, you'll see
[16:02] <ActionParsnip> histo: cat  /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
[16:02] <histo> ActionParsnip: No it's not
[16:02] <histo> ActionParsnip: how do you think that message gets at the head of /etc/resolv.conf
[16:02] <histo> ActionParsnip: from that file
[16:03] <xangua> threex5: don't you mean alt+middle button¿
[16:03] <OTI> histo, cat /etc/resolv.conf gives nameserver 8.8.8.8

[16:03] <histo> ActionParsnip: Perhaps you don't understand.
[16:03] <threex5> xangua, thank you. In mate it was right click
[16:03] <vlt> histo: Thunderbird, for example, shows me the “new mail” popup in the very moment a new email arrives on the server.
[16:03] <llutz> ActionParsnip: that is the part being copied into /etc/resolv.conf
[16:03] <ActionParsnip> histo: the file is made, you can edit the base file without issue
[16:03] <threex5> i thought it was the case in gnome 2 as well. it seems that some key bindings have changed subtly
[16:03] <OTI> ActionParsnip: that echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf > /dev/null didn't do anything, nothing visual at least
[16:04] <histo> ActionParsnip: No you're not getting it
[16:04] <BluesKaj> histo, cat works here shows the nameservers, domain and search
[16:04] <ActionParsnip> OTI: it doesn't, that's why I used /dev/null :)
[16:04] <llutz> ActionParsnip: you can edit all those files without issues, they will be copied and build "/etc/resolv.conf"
[16:04] <histo> ActionParsnip: the resolvconf  package generates the /etc/resolv.conf from the head and base
[16:04] <ActionParsnip> OTI: you can now run:   sudo apt-get update    and be ok
[16:04] <ActionParsnip> histo: llutz: I see, I'd leave the header alone, the base is much neater
[16:05] <OTI> histo, ping www.google.fi works but no pages open
[16:05] <histo> ActionParsnip: The head is just a commented message
[16:05] <ActionParsnip> OTI: can you get updates now?
[16:05] <histo> OTI: ping doesn't open pages
[16:05] <llutz> ActionParsnip: to override networkmanager you'll have to edit head, not base, to get your entries first
[16:05] <ActionParsnip> histo: gotcha
[16:05] <l057c0d3r> hmm i was thinking about droping xcompmgr and installing compiz.. but wouldnt that replace openbox?
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> l057c0d3r: yes as both are window managers
[16:06] <l057c0d3r> thats what i thought
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> l057c0d3r: you can run just compiz on its own
[16:06] <histo> ActionParsnip: after editing you also have to restart resolvconf
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> histo: true
[16:06] <OTI> histo, ActionParsnip, thanks after that sudo apt-get update network is back, thank you :)
[16:06] <ActionParsnip> OTI: yay
[16:07] <histo> OTI: although I fear your dns is only fixed temporarily
[16:07] <ActionParsnip> OTI: get fully updated then reboot, the edit to resolv.conf is not permanent but the updates may make it ok
[16:08] <OTI> ActionParsnip: get fully updated? means check latest update via software update or what?

[16:44] <ross`> ActionParsnip: personally i prefer the cli for package installation, so i asked the proper question which source do i need. The answer which the GUI told me was multiverse.
[16:44] <memand1> Ok, I'm soooory :(
[16:44] <ActionParsnip> ross`: yeah the reply when stuff needs extra sources isn't great, although the package-not-found reply for available packages is pretty coolio
[16:44] <piglit> what is a good program to Anallise where your disk space is going ?
=== Robbilie_ is now known as Robbilie
[16:45] <ross`> ActionParsnip: yea, but it didn't have a suggestion for this particular package
[16:45] <ActionParsnip> GitNick: seacrch in dash for disk analyser
[16:45] <ross`> it just said didn't exist
[16:45] <DJones> piglit: Disk usage analyser
[16:45] <ActionParsnip> ross`: d'oh
[16:45] <ross`> thank you for your help tho
[16:45] <ActionParsnip> ross`: I try, thanks for being cool
[16:45] <piglit> ok thanks
[16:45] <zykotick9> piglit: from terminal, ncdu is kinda handy
[16:45] <ross`> ActionParsnip:
[16:46] <ross`> oops
[16:46] <ross`> afk
[16:46] <MK``> apparently this works: sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean
[16:47] <phoenixsampras1> hi?
[16:47] <phoenixsampras1> jezz ubuntu mirros kinda slow
[16:48] <ActionParsnip> phoenixsampras1: tried a different source?
[16:49] <zerm> Hey. My freshly set-up system keeps crashing/freezing/rebooting. I'd like to figure out the cause for this, so
[16:49] <zerm> how can i enable kernel debugging? i do not want automatic reboot. i want a kernel debugger console or whatever
[16:49] <ActionParsnip> zerm: I suggest you test RAM using Memtest86+ from Grub as a starting point#
[16:50] <zerm> if linux/ubuntu kills a process (happened before because heavy swapping), does it log this action somewhere?
[16:50] <hilo> hello I've got a remote Ubuntu Desktop headless system which I access with VNC. The resolution on the remote DT is 800x600 and I cannot get it to go higher making many programs unusable. Can someone explain to me how to set the resolution higher on a headless Ubuntu Desktop (32 bit 10.04)
[16:50] <phoenixsampras1> apt-get upgrade-distro aint working
[16:50] <zerm> ActionParsnip, I suspect the heavy I/O I am doing with a SAS controller/network that this might cause the problem
[16:51] <zykotick9> zerm: a process could die (check it's logs) but the kernel isn't going to "kill" anything unless you ask it too.
[16:51] <uplinx> phoenixsampras1, apt-get dist-upgrade
[16:51] <phoenixsampras1> uplinx: thanks!
[16:51] <uplinx> phoenixsampras1, np
[16:52] <zerm> zykotick9, that's what i thought. but that's not happening. e.g. i had a python process where I had a bug causing severe memory consumption. after 5 minutes swapping, the process miriculously terminated without any notice. maybe that's python's behavior, though
[16:52] <ActionParsnip> phoenixsampras1: if you read the man page rather than trying to guess commands, you'll win
[16:53] <zykotick9> zerm: that's not the kernel killing it...
[16:53] <phoenixsampras1> i need to develop 2 more eyes
[16:53] <zerm> right now my load went up to 9, which cpu was aroun .3 -- that might be fine because it does a lot i/o waiting. but suddenly, the whole computer froze, and then rebooted itself
[16:53] <zerm> s/which/with
[16:53] <wjtaylor_> where is the window manager settings in 12.04?   I want to enable roll-up. (Gnome classic)
[16:54] <threex5> is there a key command in gnome to pop open a nautilus window?
[16:54] <zerm> zykotick9, ok, might be python itself then. thanks.
[16:54] <zerm> but i definitely do not want an automatic reboot, for no reason, never. who did this to me?
[16:56] <Kurukuru> test
[16:57] <Kurukuru> Are there any distros which use usplash by default? I want to install Ubuntu on an EEEPC 904HD I have but I don't like Plymouth and I have a Usplash theme I want to use
[16:57] <ActionParsnip> !info usplash
[16:57] <ubottu> Package usplash does not exist in quantal
[16:58] <ActionParsnip> Kurukuru: why do you care so much, its a boot splash....
[16:58] <Kurukuru> Just a customisation freak
[16:58] <piglit> is virtualbox still the firtual machine to use or is it a other one at this time?
[16:58] <ActionParsnip> threex5: you could use compiz to run the command when you press a shortcut combo
[16:58] <fogobogo> piglit: depends on what you want/need
[16:58] <memand> zerm: If you have some python code that goes into a infinite loop that eats memory and the interpreter for some reasson does not catch that it is an unhealty loop if can cause the system to freeze, and I guess in some casses reboot (on my system it just logged out)
[16:58] <ActionParsnip> piglit: what is 'firtual'?
[16:59] <piglit> fogobo: well first of all i need a easy install as i dont have much time
[16:59] <piglit> i need to test some labview things in XP
[16:59] <piglit> and it would be great if i could use usb
[16:59] <zerm> memand, well. i think i have fixed that issue with the python script. still, it should never ever reboot my machine
[16:59] <fogobogo> then try vbox
[17:00] <piglit> but if it takes too much time i can do without usb
[17:00] <lorddelta> respectfully...what is the issue with python-aptdaemon?
[17:00] <MonkeyDust> piglit  I have XP in virtualbox, runs nice
[17:00] <memand> zerm: I agree...
[17:00] <piglit> fogobogo: vbox ?= virtualbox?
[17:00] <ActionParsnip> piglit: the vbox from the vbox repo has usb access
[17:00] <lorddelta> A bunch of packages were complaining about it this morning; I just ended up building the package I wanted to and installing it manually...
[17:00] <fogobogo> piglit: yes
[17:00] <ActionParsnip> piglit: yes vbox = virtualbox
[17:00] <lorddelta> No problems so far.
[17:00] <piglit> ok thanks you guys are great
[17:00] <zerm> nothing in /var/log/kernel.log -- just a (super fast, at least) reboot
[17:01] <piglit> I can also import virtual machines i have from vmware ?
[17:01] <MonkeyDust> piglit  vmdk yes, import
[17:01] <ActionParsnip> piglit: i'd ask in #vmware, I'd imagine so
[17:02] <zerm> humm "BUG: soft lockup - CPU#2 stuck for 21s! [Xorg:1183]" what is that?!
[17:03] <luvs-lightw8> I have a Toshiba Satellite A305D and the media touch keys do not work. This has not been an issue with other flavors of linux. I'm on peppermint. Any ideas?

[17:11] <blaamann_b570> Is there a way I can see the crash report that is sent when Firefox crashes for me and the error send dialog appear asking me if I would send the crash report or not?
[17:13] <memand> zerm: Can I ask what you where trying to do in python to cause the crash?
[17:14] <zerm> basically just backup over network share to a SAS-connected tape drive
[17:14] <lonewulf85> Hello everyone I have a question about VMware player.
[17:14] <zerm> computing hashes on the fly, there was my first bug (loaded files fully to memory first). but that's fixed and as long as the backup-source can keep up with the speed, it works just fine
[17:15] <zerm> the panics seem to be related to the BUG soft - lock CPU#2 stall
[17:15] <lonewulf85> I am wondering if I could run XP or Vista in it and have the silerlight capacity?
[17:15] <mibofra_smart> hi :)
[17:15] <zerm> i mean, that looks like a panic. i'm not so super linux expert, i expected some big "PANIC" in a log
[17:16] <zerm> still, it reboots and does not dump the core. i wish i could prevent that
[17:16] <zerm> best would be to drop into kdb or whatever
[17:16] <zerm> is there a sysctl or something?
[17:16] <memand> zerm: I'm not 100% sure what that BUG means, but it does not sound too good
[17:17] <zerm> according to google, there was a bug in the linux kernel 3 years ago with that symtop/error message
[17:17] <zerm> but that's about it
[17:17] <lonewulf85> I am taking a PC class and for one site testout.com I need silverlight I was hoping I could run a VM as a work around.
[17:18] <zerm> could be related to APIC, I read, which makes sense as my interrupts get high and stuff. that SAS controller seams shitty as well
[17:18] <jorik_> рус есть?
[17:18] <ThinkT510> lonewulf85: yes, that would work
=== karela is now known as nuxninja
[17:18] <memand> Well the Xorg 1183 msg might yield some more info
[17:19] <lonewulf85> ThinkT510: Thank you I was hoping I could I was just unsure as I have never done a Windows guest OS before.
[17:20] <memand> zerm: Are you sure that your computer actually rebooted, I mean did it show the bios boot screen and evertything?
[17:20] <zerm> uptime told me
[17:21] <zerm> ssh connection dropped, i reconnected, uptime is low, all my previously running processes are gone
[17:21] <zerm> didnt want to walk all the stairs up to the computer, but been told that it presents the login screen
[17:21] <zerm> so guess it rebooted
[17:22] <jorik_> чат на рус какой?
[17:22] <memand> I can't find anything yet on that Xorg error, but it sounds like the x server crashed

[17:25] <xinglenick> I use ubuntu 12.04, How can I find out the file which the env LC_LANGUAGE is set?
[17:25] <zerm> so, sysctl kernel.panic controls after how many second it reboots after a panic. which somebody set to 0 which sucks

[17:26] <belgianguy> does that mean the php file needs to be chmoded or that this should be sudo cronjob?

Any suggestions?  here is a log of the apt output...you can see the weird garbled crap: https://pastee.org/uf8jj

[17:28] <memand> belgianguy: chmod +x file.php
[17:28] <memand> zerm: I'm still having a hard time believing that it actually rebooted
[17:28] <jrib> xinglenick: in general, with much frustration :)  What are you looking for?
[17:29] <belgianguy> thanks memand
[17:29] <zerm> memand, yeah, can't help. it did. possibly that f*cking SAS controller because i had similar experiences on a different set-up before (but attributed it to some other reasons back then..)
[17:31] <zerm> will try with noapic boot flag
[17:31] <zerm> and strict panicing
[17:31] <memand> zerm: does this happen often?
[17:31] <zerm> wish me luck, will physically go to the box
[17:31] <memand> lol
[17:31] <xinglenick> my LC_LANGUAGE was changed, and I want to know why it was  changed
[17:32] <zerm> memand, yeah pretty much. that's gonna be the backup managing machine, which makes it ver... delicate
[17:32] <teefs> should I ask in emacs?  it says the package is maintained by ubuntu

[17:37] <jrib> teefs: read haskell-site-file.el and see if anything looks weird?
[17:39] <z_erm> memand, i'm not sure that it's related to the machine at all. more the SAS controller or tape drive, i guess. Had some (but only some) unexplainable reboots quite a while ago when using a completely different machine
[17:40] <z_erm> now i've set all kernel.panic* sysctls to debugging values, disabled apic, rebooted. let's see. backup will take about 1-2 hours until crash/freeze
[17:41] <xinglenick> memand: i set LC_LANGUAGE to en_US in /etc/default/locale file and ran update-locale, then reboot and login, but i still found the LC_LANGUAGE is set to zh_CN:en_US:en

[17:43] <guide_X> is it not possible to update it or?
[17:44] <ThinkT510> guide_X: why didn't you upgrade to a newer release when it was supported?
[17:44] <teefs> jrib: I can't find anything, and ironically, haskell-site-file.el is parsed fine by emacs elisp mode :)
[17:44] <teefs> really weird

[17:45] <guide_X> thats when it cannot update
[17:45] <guide_X> it says the program closed unexpectedly
[17:45] <jrib> teefs: you might try redownloading the deb (delete what you have in /var/cache/apt/archives/ ) and installing that to see if it makes a difference.  Might also check the various files for the package in /var/lib/dpkg/info/ .  And finally, you might checkout debsums.  I'm not really sure what's going on :)

[19:36] <friendy> Yes Monkey, I am trying to get a windows game to work via Hamachi, multiplayer.
[19:36] <MonkeyDust> friendy  in wine, then?
[19:37] <friendy> Yes. The game works perfectly, merely the producers of that game made horrible multiplayer that works perfectly in Ham.
[19:37] <MonkeyDust> friendy  have you asked in #winehq ?
[19:38] <friendy> The Hamachi version, there exists a Linux version of that. It's not the game, its the linux version of Hamachi, which I am having problems installing. One said I needed lsb, but it looks like its on. Another said you can do it a different way, but when I click it, the terminal comes up and dissapears so fast.
[19:39] <MonkeyDust> friendy  i read here, the linux version is beta, so perhaps buggy
[19:40] <friendy> Slightly buggy. I merely request help in getting it installed via the beta-buggy version, or the other way (Another person compiled something or this or that, supposed to be easier to install, because of problems with lsb, and an add on he made later had a gui version).
[19:40] <keith_> I have a macbook dual booting OSX and Ubuntu. I haven't used OSX in months and would like to remove it. Can I do this safely without any ill effects? I'm concerned if I clear that partition, it will really screw rEFIt up
[19:41] <garnet> keith_: Just out of curiosity, what exactly in Ubuntu is better than in OS X?

[19:42] <local> know^
[19:42] <MonkeyDust> friendy  no, i'm not a gamer and not familiar with windows
[19:43] <Lartza> What apt command would show me what package forced an install of another
[19:43] <friendy> But it's not with a windows program, but its with getting something installed, dealing with the terminal and ./install.sh and scripts, not with windows or windows games.
[19:43] <keith_> garnet: Package management. I used to use MacPorts when I was on OSX, but I find that the Debian repos are much larger, and in particular contained a package that I needed and couldn't get to compile on my own. Other than that, the two are not so different

[19:43] <phy1729> keith_: I'd put rEFIt on it's own partition then whipe the Mac one perhaps leaving the recovery behind just in case
[19:44] <friendy> Can you at least help me resolve this error when I use the .Deb file? ---Dependency is not satisfiable: lsb-core (>= 3.0) ----
[19:44] <keith_> garnet: Additionally, my next computer will not be a MacBook, and another computer I have is also not made by apple
[19:44] <EvanCarroll> friendy: does Hamachi run under wine? or is it a native linux app?
[19:44] <kvothetech> friendy: install lsb-core version greater than or equal to 3.0
[19:44] <keith_> phy1729: Can I then expand the partition that Ubuntu is on without destroying any other data?
[19:44] <phy1729> depends on the filesystem
[19:45] <friendy> Both. I'm trying to install the linux version. It was made into a native app.
[19:45] <kvothetech> keith_: depends on your hdd filesystem free space in other partitions etc
[19:45] <garnet> keith_: Ubuntu uses ext4. It's easily and safely expandable from LiveCD (USB)
[19:45] <Lartza> apt-cache rdepends package lists all and not only what's installed...
[19:45] <friendy> Kvothetech, where do I install the ones greater or equal? I've found so many links, and when I opend up systenamtic and typed in lsb, everything that was in there was installed.
[19:46] <keith_> kvothetech, garnet, phy1729: thank you all
[19:46] <garnet> I think you can just delete your OS X partition from LiveCD (USB) and expand Ubuntu to fill it up. rEFIt being a EFI boot manager shouldn't become broken
[19:46] <Lartza> For example I have plymouth, libavformat etc installed and I want to know why

[19:48] <friendy> Dependency is not satisfiable: alien (>= 8.36) ---Yeah, I am.

[19:49] <kvothetech> TLoT: that's more than enough space but yeah....
[19:49] <TLoT> friendy: it means that solving your solution is a bit more tricky
[19:49] <jhutchins_wk> kvothetech: gparted can expand partitions if there is available space.  You need to make a backup any time you're messing with partitions though, and it's actually faster once you've made the backup to just repartition & restore.
[19:49] <TLoT> kvothetech: 50MB sufficient?
[19:49] <MonkeyDust> friendy  you're asking for help with a beta system nobody has ever heard of on a ubuntu version that is no longer supported
[19:49] <garnet> keith_: It's a problem then. Anyway, it you are set on deleting OS X why you need rEFIt? You can just install GRUB from LiveCD (USB) on your hdd.
[19:49] <TLoT> friendy: also what MonkeyDust said
[19:49] <kvothetech> friendy: just find the packages with the versions it wants and install them.
[19:50] <friendy> I don't understand? I keep getting dependency stuff, like Dependency is not satisfiable: alien (>= 8.36)  when I followed the link to the lsb and tried installing it.
[19:50] <kvothetech> TLoT: yeah 50mb is fine...mines 20
[19:50] <andai> My computer won't boot. I had a similar problem before. It says there's no disk space, when I deleted stuff it worked fine. This time it continues to say there is no available disk space even when I delete stuff. I tried to check the filesystem but it keeps telling me it's still mounted (when I try to unmount it it tells me it's not mounted)
[19:50] <TLoT> kvothetech: i like keeping a tad extra space, i'll leave it at 50 then :P
[19:51] <TLoT> kvothetech: i used to do this in my sleep, but it was all ext3, since ext4 seems to be the standard nowadays... :P
[19:51] <friendy> As I literally have no clue what packages to which version it wants, it just wants lsb. I got that dependency error when tryin to install that, so...Mhm.
[19:51] <kvothetech> TLoT: yeah cant wait for the few bugs in btrfs to be fixed.
[19:51] <TLoT> friendy: i would suggest upgrading to a more supported release - 10.10
[19:51] <Jpmh> I want to install ubuntu side-by-side with Windoze on a new compaq - problem is that compaq have set 4 partitions (at least I believe this is the problem) and so I have nowhere to install ubuntu - I need an idiots guide on how to expand/change the limit so ubuntu will install
[19:51] <Catbuntu> What happens if I use an unsupported Ubuntu version?
[19:51] <TLoT> 's no longer updated
[19:51] <Catbuntu> For example 10.10
[19:51] <TLoT> Catbuntu: no security updates, repo issues, newer software FTBFS in it...
[19:51] <jhutchins_wk> friendy: Which version of Ubuntu are you running?
[19:51] <TLoT> etc.
[19:51] <kvothetech> friendly it tells you what version of what it wants when it errors..
[19:52] <Catbuntu> But could I still install thingies from the repos?
[19:52] <andai> concisely: system won't boot, disk claims to be full, remains full when large files deleted, can't check it because it's "mounted", even though I unmount it
[19:52] <TLoT> Catbuntu: only old security-hole-riddled things
[19:52] <TLoT> !eol | Catbuntu
[19:52] <ubottu> Catbuntu: End-Of-Life is the time when security updates and support for an Ubuntu release stop, see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases for more information. Looking to upgrade from an EOL release? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EOLUpgrades
[19:52] <keith_> garnet: Ahh I thought I need it anyway
[19:52] <Catbuntu> thanks
[19:52] <TLoT> Catbuntu: you can use the 'oldreleases' repositories, but...
[19:52] <TLoT> Catbuntu: i strongly advise you use asupported softwrae
[19:52] <jhutchins_wk> andai: Need to boot to a different disk.
[19:52] <tigran> How can I move the min/max/close buttons to the left side in Unity/12.10? Or is this theme specific and not configurable?
[19:52] <kvothetech> friendy: linux is  a lot like bsd in that the core packages and stuff need to be versioned around each other so it all works stabley...
[19:52] <Catbuntu> yep
[19:52] <jhutchins_wk> andai: Rescue disk
[19:53] <Catbuntu> I don't really like Unity.
[19:53] <garnet> keith_: My personal advice is simply not to waste your time and stick to OS X.
[19:53] <friendy> I am using Maverick...
[19:53] <kvothetech> Catbuntu: so don't use it.
[19:53] <Catbuntu> And nothing is lovely as Gnome 2 :(
[19:53] <andai> jhutchins_wk: It's a laptop. I have no different disk. Should I install ubuntu to a USB stick?
[19:53] <friendy> i would upgrade, but I got no USB or CD to use, unless they're is a third way.
[19:53] <Catbuntu> I'm using Cinnamon now
[19:53]  * jhutchins_wk goes to the web to look up Maveric...
[19:53] <jhutchins_wk> andai: Yes, that should work.
[19:54] <kvothetech> friendy: you can update from a previous version just do dist-upgrade...or change the repo's do an update then upgrade...
[19:54] <andai> jhutchins_wk: When I have that set up, how do I fix it?
[19:54] <friendy> Well, I kinda would. But when I did Sudo apt-get update n the stuff
[19:54] <jhutchins_wk> andai: It's possible you have run out of inodes (df -i would show you).
[19:54] <kvothetech> friendy: note that second way you may want to do 1 release updateat a time and test what broke fix it then do it again...
[19:54] <friendy> IT just, kinda, said failed to fetch files
[19:54] <jhutchins_wk> friendy: The problem would appear to be that the package you're trying to install is not compatible with that older version of Ubuntu.
[19:54] <Catbuntu> Which is the more Gnome2-like desktop environment?
[19:54] <Catbuntu> (not MATE)
[19:54] <friendy> I see.
[19:55] <friendy> If I upgrade, it won't screw up my system, will it?
[19:55] <andai> jhutchins_wk: I'll check
[19:55] <jhutchins_wk> friendy: There's always that chance <grin>.
[19:55] <Lartza> Why is apt-get listing me crazy unmet dependencies? Like libkatepartinterfaces4, which I do not have? Trying to remove plymouth
[19:55] <kvothetech> friendy: usually it breaks a few things here and there but nothing unfixable
[19:55] <jhutchins_wk> friendy: Don't go directly from 10.10 to 12.10 though, step through each version.
[19:55] <friendy> Alright. I'll try upgrading then. Do I use the terminal or the GUI update tool? OR does not matter?
[19:55] <kvothetech> Catbuntu: gnome3 in the old view mode
[19:55] <jhutchins_wk> !upgrade
[19:55] <ubottu> For upgrading, see the instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UpgradeNotes - see also http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/upgrade
[19:55] <kvothetech> friendy: i use the terminal....but you can use whatever you want.
[19:56] <friendy> Alright, how do I go to each step without a total skip to 12.10? OR does it do it for me, going by through each step?
[19:56] <Catbuntu> kvothetech, that worked fine on 12.04.
[19:56] <andai> jhutchins_wk: 3% IUSE
[19:56] <kvothetech> friendy: when you do the update it'll tell you.
[19:56] <jhutchins_wk> friendy: You need to do each step.  Basically you change the sources.list to the next version name, update, upgrade, repeat.
[19:56] <andai> jhutchins_wk: interestingly, they all return the same number ( cause they're on the same drive? )
[19:56] <Catbuntu> But on 12.10, when I click the window name on the window list, it just gets... highlighted?
[19:56] <Catbuntu> Using the Ambiance and Radiance themes.
[19:57] <friendy> Upgrade to 10.04 then.
[19:57] <Catbuntu> I think it's related to its new thingies and murrine engine.
[19:57] <MonkeyDust> friendy  upgrading to each following version would take forever
[19:57] <zykotick9> jhutchins_wk: warning, ubuntu doesn't use source.list to update to a new version!  friendy
[19:57] <jhutchins_wk> MonkeyDust: it's not safe to jump major versions.
[19:57] <kvothetech> MonkeyDust: eh you don't have to but it doesn't take that much extra time and that way he can fix what broke in each update as he goes along
[19:57] <Catbuntu> Well, I'll see
[19:57] <Catbuntu> Bye
[19:58] <friendy> I got good net, though...Alright, I'm about to use the GUI tool to upgrade. Can I keep Skype/Games/Browser up while updating, or close everything, and do I go from version to version.
[19:58] <kvothetech> MonkeyDust: and he's not stuck with 100 bugs at once.
[19:58] <friendy> And restart after each update?
[19:58] <kvothetech> friendy: you don't have to.
[19:58] <jhutchins_wk> friendy: Yes.  Please do read those guides before you start though..
[19:58] <friendy> Guides?
[19:59] <friendy> I thought it was as simple as pressing a button, and it's all upgraded n nice ?
[19:59] <jhutchins_wk> kvothetech: Need to keep the system in sync with the kernel.
[19:59] <friendy> syn with kernel? Confused...
[19:59] <andai> jhutchins_wk: I tried to e2fsck the drive, it says device does not exist
[19:59] <andai> D:
[19:59] <kvothetech> jhutchins_wk: you don't have to restart to use a new kernel...eassiest method maybe but you don't have to.
[19:59] <jhutchins_wk> andai: fdisk -l
[19:59] <friendy> Alright, upgradin now :)
[19:59] <jhutchins_wk> andai: maybe it's called something else when booted to the USB>
[20:00] <andai> jhutchins_wk: cannot open /proc/partitions
[20:00] <jhutchins_wk> kvothetech: Hot patching a kernel is not usually within the average users's ability.
[20:00] <andai> jhutchins_wk: i'm not on USB yet, i'm trying to find it
[20:00] <zykotick9> jhutchins_wk: andai you need to use "sudo fdisk -l" to see anything.  sidenote "sudo parted -l" has better support.
[20:01] <tigran> How can I move the min/max/close buttons to the left side in Unity/12.10? Or is this theme specific and not configurable?
[20:01] <andai> zykotick9: thanks
[20:02] <jhutchins_wk> andai: Yeah, you do need to boot to the USB.
[20:02] <andai> zykotick9: parted -l, no output. parted, "error: no device found"
[20:02] <andai> Yeah, i'm screwed
[20:02] <jhutchins_wk> zykotick9: Yeah, I always forget sudo.
[20:02] <andai> can i use an ancient ubuntu cd
[20:02] <jhutchins_wk> zykotick9: fdisk is quick and easy (and what I remember).
[20:02] <jhutchins_wk> andai: What filesystem?
[20:03] <escott> andai, are you in a chroot?
[20:03] <mir_> hi
[20:04] <jhutchins_wk> escott: He's on a corrupted system.
[20:04] <UlyssesGa> Hi there!  I'm having a problem dual-booting Windows 8 and Ubuntu 12.04.  Non-UEFI system (so no Secure boot).  Each installation is on its own hard drive, with the Ubuntu drive being the set as the primary bootable device in the system BIOS. (grub2 also situated on linux drive).
[20:04] <zykotick9> jhutchins_wk: i hear you!  i feel like i've "grown up" with fdisk.  for a laugh, read "man fdisk" on a debian system, and the "BUGS" section at the very bottom - VERY informative, including "fdisk is a buggy program that does fuzzy things", and suggests using fdisk as a last resort.
[20:04] <escott> jhutchins_wk, but that shouldnt prevent a file like /proc/partitions from existing
[20:05] <zink> hi all, simple question, but when I find downloads on launchpad, can I apt-get install them or do I have to download them and install manually?
[20:05] <andai> escott: I don't know the meaning of the word
[20:05] <andai> jhutchins_wk: ext4
[20:06] <andai> I found a 512mb usb stick. Looks like I'm using DSL
[20:06] <escott> andai, is anything listed with ls /proc?
[20:07] <andai> escott: lemmecheck
[20:07] <andai> escott: no
[20:07] <UlyssesGa> If Win8 is set as the first bootable HD, it starts fine.  If the Ubuntu drive is chosen as the 1st bootable drive and I attempt to boot to Win 8 from grub, Win8 immediately reboots.
[20:07] <escott> andai, can you paste the output of "mount"
[20:08] <escott> andai, in particular i want to know if proc is mounted on /proc and sysfs on /sys and udev on /dev
[20:09] <TLoT> what evil is this?  "The installer crashed!"
[20:09] <TLoT> in LTS! o.o
[20:09] <andai> escott: Yes, all of those
[20:10] <escott> andai, if proc is mounted on /proc then something should be listed in /proc
[20:10] <andai> escott: Yeah, well, as previously mentioned, nothing is behaving as expected :P
[20:12] <escott> andai, you are going to have to dig through dmesg to figure out what is going on
[20:12] <andai> escott: I haven't used linux in years, now I remember why :D
=== ubuntu is now known as Guest82799
[20:13] <andai> escott: although I'm pretty sure the laptop's hard drive is just dying
[20:14] <jhutchins_wk> andai: escott means well, but the first thing to do is to boot to some other media and check the disk.
[20:14] <jhutchins_wk> andai: The problem with "really old debian" is that it may not support ext4
[20:14] <jhutchins_wk> andai: or you said really old ubuntu - same deal.
[20:15] <andai> jhutchins_wk: Oh you just reminded me where I moved them, thank you :D
[20:15] <jhutchins_wk> andai: You don't have another system that you can use to download a newer rescue disk?
[20:15] <JonEdney> Is there a graphical way to monitor resource usage such as RAM, on Ubuntu Destkop?
[20:15] <andai> jhutchins_wk: I could mount it in Virtualbox and then install it to USB, but that would still have to be DSL or puppy cause it's a tiny USB
[20:16] <malkauns> JonEdney, ksysguard
[20:16] <jhutchins_wk> andai: No cds?
[20:16] <sakkemo> Hi, would this be sensible for HDD+SSD setup? SSD: / and /home, HDD: swap (for hibernate), /home subfolders (Downloads, Videos etc.), which would be mounted in /home.
[20:16] <andai> jhutchins_wk: let me see if i can find the old ubuntu CDs

[21:09] <kittenmittens> is there a program i can use to creat an iso of a disk?
[21:10] <kittenmittens> anyone?
[21:10] <genoobie> okay
[21:10] <genoobie> I give up
[21:11] <kittenmittens> what are you giving up on geniibie
[21:11] <genoobie> kittenmittens, I am trying to install lubuntu
[21:11] <kittenmittens> mm?
[21:11] <genoobie> brb sorry
[21:13] <Mind_> kingbeast: Probably! I tried in the backtrack but I still cannot. the image is created in dvd and does not boot! I do not know what happened.
[21:15] <kingbeast> Mind_: use another computer to download it if you have access to another one.
[21:15] <bekks> Mind_: Did you burn the image or did you create a new data dvd with the image file as its content?
[21:16] <kittenmittens> i need a program that will let me make an iso of a disk please
[21:16] <bekks> kittenmittens: dd
[21:16] <kittenmittens> ?
[21:17] <bekks> kittenmittens: The program name is "dd".
[21:17] <bekks> kittenmittens: Using dd, you can create an iso image when having a cd/dvd disk.
[21:18] <Mind_> bekks: I know that have to choose, but, the program maybe do not make the content.. Did not show this in menu and in nowhere!
[21:18] <Mind_> kingbeast: I do not!
[21:18] <bekks> Mind_: So which program did you use?
[21:20] <genoobie> kittenmittens, sorry I had a family thing for a min
[21:20] <genoobie> well the basic idea is this
[21:20] <genoobie> 12.10 lubuntu install fails to recog vga hardware
[21:20] <genoobie> xubuntu livecd 12.04 works OK
[21:20] <genoobie> so what gives?
[21:20] <Mind_> bekks: The name is: CD and DVD CREATOR. the icon of the program is a little pen drive. I have it in back track KDE.
[21:20] <nomodeset> Are ther any replacement to seahorse-plugins pack in 12.04?
[21:21] <genoobie> kittenmittens, that's the issue
[21:21] <bekks> Mind_: I never used backtrack, sorry. I guess there is some "Help" or "About" menu entry when starting that application.
[21:21] <nomodeset> sure!
[21:22] <nomodeset> Are there any replacement to seahorse-plugins pack in 12.04?
[21:23] <Billybeagle> so im having sftp problems connecting to my ubuntu 12.04 server.          I had it all set up yesterday with a sftponly user and uploaded my site. Now im getting can not connect to host in dreamweaver. however my primary root user account can connect to host.

[21:31] <Seven_Six_Two> I had removed empathy when I first upgraded to 12.10 because it kept crashing. I've just reinstalled it, but it's not included in indicator menu. Is there another package that I should install? I don't see empathy-indicator
[21:31] <nomodeset> kittenmittens: and easier
[21:31] <Mind_> nomodeset: Sorry!
[21:32] <mojtaba> I have just recently installed ubuntu on my laptop (Studio Dell 1555), but the fan is always working
[21:32] <ironhalik> Seven_Six_Two: I think you need to run it at least once from the dash
[21:32] <Seven_Six_Two> ironhalik, it's running now
[21:32] <_helios_> kittenmittens: Ubuntu is 100x better than Windows for many reasons probably to many to list in this channel.
[21:32] <nomodeset> _helios_: I agree
[21:32] <kittenmittens> im jsut not seeing it.. because windows is more stable.. has infinitly more support hardware wise and software..
[21:33] <Seven_Six_Two> ironhalik, only gwibber and thunderbird are listed in indicator menu. maybe I have to log out?
[21:33] <ironhalik> Seven_Six_Two: should get autoadded to messeging menu after first run. If it did not, I'm clueless

[21:38] <gskellig> oh alright

[21:38] <llutz> jolaren: getent group backup ; getent passwd backup               to check
[21:38] <jolaren> llutz: hmm.. but when i wrote adduser backup it didn't prompt for errors.. but i had to run passwd after adduser
[21:39] <nomodeset> gskellig: Yeah, i found a forum wich sais that it is no longer in gnome 3
[21:39] <jolaren> llutz: backup:x:34:34:backup:/var/backups:/bin/sh
[21:39] <gskellig> where can I get to the additional drivers?
[21:40] <nomodeset> gskellig: Software center

[21:40] <przemek> drac dell default login
[21:40] <przemek> and passworD?
[21:40] <jolaren> llutz: if i added a password to that user on the server.. would it cause thinks that controls the backup to fail?
[21:40] <llutz> jolaren: thats a user you pasted
[21:41] <Mind_> I need open the Download path from livecd and i do not have permission. How can I open it?
[21:41] <jolaren> llutz: oh, so ubuntu has a user named backup
[21:41] <nomodeset> gskellig: Search "Additional drivers" at the software center
[21:42] <llutz> jolaren: the command above should have given you 2 lines output, 1st is a group, 2nd the user
[21:42] <ironhalik> my TP x220 running ubuntu is drawing ~20W of power for some reason
[21:42] <ironhalik> at idle/low load

[21:43] <gskellig> but "ubuntu-drivers-common" is already installed (and updated)
[21:43] <nomodeset> or "sudo apt-get-update"
[21:43] <jolaren> llutz: im afraid that i might have broken some services by setting a password to "backup" user
[21:43] <llutz> jolaren: thats odd, a group shouldn't have a homedir/shell set
[21:43] <nomodeset> gskellig: it does not matter
[21:44] <jolaren> llutz: do you think that's a possability? ^
[21:44] <llutz> jolaren: i'm not sure, but i wonder why you havent got any error/warning when creating the (existing) user
[21:44] <gskellig> still nothing

[21:45] <gskellig> ah got it
[21:45] <nomodeset> gskellig: what happend?
[21:46] <gskellig> apt-get was installed not aptitude
[21:46] <gskellig> installed aptitude and updated and it showed up in software center
[21:46] <llutz> !aptitude | gskellig
[21:46] <ubottu> gskellig: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.

[21:48] <Narel> I have all dependencies I think, configure is correct but there is an error in make
[21:48] <nomodeset> gskellig: X)

[22:34] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica: I don't know what do you mean

[22:35] <SonikkuAmerica> Guest80282, sounds like a hardware issue. Tell me a little about the machine you're trying to run it on.
[22:35] <Guest80282> SonikkuAmerica: Dell Studio 1555
[22:36] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie, After installing a third-party driver (repo or otherwise), you needto activate it via "Additional Drivers" or type [ sudo jockey ] in a terminal.

[22:56] <Ramtron> Hi
[22:56] <SQLWorld> :CookiesandJuice: what version of unbuntu are you using??
[22:56] <SonikkuAmerica> nomodeset: Why are you using su?
[22:56] <Ramtron> My harddrive died recently... So I used my old one, but couldn't install windows 7 because it had no drivers. Luckily I had a Ubuntu 12.04 disc laying around. Does anyone know how to get all my drivers back? Preferably on Windows 7........
[22:57] <nomodeset> SonikkuAmerica: I want to change to my root status
[22:57] <nomodeset> Ramtron: You can call to microsoft
[22:58] <Ramtron> Why would I do that?
[22:58] <L3top> Ramtron: typically one would go to the websites of the hardware and download the drivers for the specific models.
[22:58] <SonikkuAmerica> nomodeset: use [ sudo -i ]
[22:58] <Ramtron> I can't, I can't install Windows 7 at all without drivers
[22:58] <SonikkuAmerica> nomodeset: Then you can mess with your machine as much as you want
[22:58] <Ramtron> I can use Ubuntu of course, but I'd prefer not to since I can't use Skype for school on here
[22:58] <Ben64> !skype | Ramtron
[22:59] <ubottu> Ramtron: To install Skype on Ubuntu, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Skype - To record on Skype, check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SkypeRecordingHowto - Please use open protocols instead if you can, see !Ekiga
[22:59] <L3top> Ramtron: the point is... this is not an ubuntu question... it is a windows question. Getting your windows OS going is not within the scope of this channel
[22:59] <nomodeset> SonikkuAmerica: Yeah, or [sudo -s] but why su doesnot run
[22:59] <Ben64> !root | nomodeset
[22:59] <ubottu> nomodeset: Do not try to guess the root password, that is impossible. Instead, realise the truth... there is no root password. Then you will see that it is 'sudo' that grants you access and not the root password. Look at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo
[22:59] <Ramtron> I know :( but I need help I know you guys have the ability to do that
[22:59] <Ben64> Ramtron: try ##windows
[22:59] <Ramtron> And I know I can USE Skype, but my webcam was built in my laptop updise down so it's annoying
[22:59] <rypervenche> LOL
[23:00] <rypervenche> nomodeset: You CAN set a root password if you really want, but by default there is none.
[23:01] <jhutchins_wk> Ramtron: I haven't had a Windows machine since 2003 or 2004.
[23:01] <L3top> Ramtron: I am afraid you need another channel. Let's pretend you made widgets. Your widget competition is largely incompetent, but largely popular. Does it become your burden to support your competition's widgets?
[23:01] <nomodeset> rypervenche: There s more protection without password: a pradox!
[23:01] <jhutchins_wk> Ramtron: You can probably get the drivers, and possibly a restore disk, from your hardware manufacturer.
[23:01] <nomodeset> rypervenche: How can i do it?
[23:01] <Ramtron> I have a restore disc but there's no drivers on it
[23:01] <Ramtron> apparently
[23:01] <Ben64> nomodeset: it is not recommended, you should just use sudo
[23:02] <L3top> Ramtron: That does not affect the position here. /join ##windows
[23:02] <SonikkuAmerica> nomodeset: The [ su ] command doesn't work unless you set a password for the user "root."
[23:02] <zoom> good evening
[23:02] <nomodeset> Ben64: yeah, yeah! but how can i do it?
[23:02] <Ben64> nomodeset: by using sudo
[23:02] <Woozie> nomodeset: sudo passwd root
[23:02] <Ramtron> Can you please just help, instead? It's very important, no one's answering there
[23:02] <rypervenche> nomodeset: You can do "sudo -i" to get the same thing done. Otherwise, you can change it by doing "sudo passwd root"
[23:02] <Ben64> Ramtron: no
[23:02] <L3top> Ramtron: that is kind of the point.
[23:02] <L3top> Would they field your linux questions?
[23:02] <Ramtron> People are doing illegal shit all over the world, and you kids are afraid to break rules in a damn IRC chat
[23:03] <Ramtron> grow up
[23:03] <Ramtron> No one cares. You're not getting paid

[23:15] <Ben64> Sara: how many times do you need to install windows?
[23:15] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: Note that you need to install grub to the device such as /dev/sda, not a partition like /dev/sda1

[23:22] <Sara> ben I have done that last ime it erases my files in ubuntu i should begin from scrach
[23:22] <L3top> Sara, if you install windows AFTER *buntu on its own partition... you will have to update grub

[23:23] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: As long as you don't install Windows to the same partition as Ubuntu it won't erase your files, but it will overwrite grub.
[23:23] <Sara> right click on computer and manage
[23:23] <notonmint> In Ubuntu 12.10, which package manages the displaying of the volume level when changing it via keyboard, if anyone happens to know.
[23:23] <Celso> i doubt
[23:23] <L3top> Sara: Windows does not understand linux... linux understands windows. If you want to install both... install windows first, then linux.
[23:23] <Ben64> notonmint: stop playing games, we can't help you
[23:24] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: It sounds like when you installed Windows you formated the ext4 partition.
[23:24] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: That means it's not ext4 any more.
[23:24] <L3top> Sara: going the other direction requires doing things which are time consuming.
[23:24] <Sara> when you have them both installed and you want to reinstall windows. how are you going to manage that L3top

[23:28] <Ramtron> I give up. I have no drivers, how do I get them back on 12.04?

[23:31] <Kurukuru> gives me an internet connection message
[23:31] <k1l> Kurukuru: pastebin the messages please
[23:31] <gmulak_> histo - It's on a mini itx board I want to say a D2500?  Does that sound right?
[23:31] <Ben64> Sara: you currently do not have ubuntu installed on your computer, if you would like to dual boot, you need to install ubuntu
[23:31] <Celso> sara, isn't seperated in more partitions?
[23:31] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: Right. [ sudo jockey ] alone should give you a text-based version of the program.
[23:31] <histo> gmulak_: Doesn't really sound right.  Is it intel based or nvidia?
[23:32] <gmulak_> histo - Intel based
[23:32] <histo> gmulak_: Like i've seen atom boards with nvidia ion chips
[23:32] <xius> so I'm trying to install 12.04 onto a partition on my mac. when I ran the installer, it encounter an error when installing grub. I decided to restart my computer holding alt to boot back into os x to research the problem, except rEFIt didn't load.
[23:32] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica: no such co
[23:32] <Sara> what do you mean seperated? ubuntu and windows are in diferent partitions
=== Ubuntu is now known as Guest55594
[23:32] <gmulak_> histo - no, I do know that much, it is intel based
[23:32] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: OK, try [ sudo startx ]
[23:32] <histo> gmulak_: Let's put it this way it will run ubuntu.   Your issue is going to be ram consumption.  You could try to mitigate the issue by using a 32bit version
[23:32] <Sara> 300gb win 300gb ubuntu
[23:32] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, no such command
[23:33] <histo> gmulak_: Or go with a lighter variant of ubuntu like xubuntu or lubuntu
[23:33] <Brewster> Ok so a while ago I attemted to update my nvidia drivers not knowing my graphics card was supported. The update succeeded but I was left with a terminal log in screen. I wiped everything and reinstalled ubuntu but now I can't keep anything on for more than 10 minutes or my graphics card sizzles and I lose the display. If I turn everything off and wait a bit everything works fine for
[23:33] <Brewster> another 10 minutes. Does anyone have a clue as to how I might fix this?
[23:33] <gmulak_> histo - OK.  I don't think I can add ram.  I know xubuntu - what is lubuntu?
=== Guest49778 is now known as cantoma
[23:33] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, NVIDIA input/output error
[23:33] <SonikkuAmerica> I have a ? of my own: Is it possible to change the behavior of Ctrl+Alt+Delete in the GUI?
[23:33] <Woozie> same as always
[23:33] <Celso> Sara, now enter on that 300 gb ubuntu partition and tell me what is inside.
[23:34] <histo> gmulak_: lubuntu is lxde based
[23:34] <Brewster> on top of that I would like to ask: Does nvidia have problems with ubuntu or does ubuntu have problems with nvidia?
[23:34] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: Hmmm...
[23:34] <gmulak_> OK - cool  Thank you very much!
[23:34] <daftykins> Brewster: so since you reinstalled, what driver are you using?
[23:34] <nomodeset> where can i enable transparencies ?
[23:35] <Brewster> oh wasn't*
[23:35] <Celso> Sara, but i would advise you to grab a live cd or usb and to reinstall the ubuntu again
[23:35] <Brewster> daftykins: well I switched back to the drivers that I previously had nvidia-current-updates
[23:35] <daftykins> Brewster: do you know your card?
[23:35] <Sara> cannot mount it celso it does not find ubuntu partions anymore
[23:36] <Ben64> Brewster: do you have dual gpu? like intel and nvidia
[23:36] <Kurukuru> k1l, http://pastebin.ca/2309094
[23:36] <histo> gmulak_: just make sure you use 32bit version with that little ram.  Also what is SCALE?
[23:36] <Celso> it only says 600gb?
[23:36] <Brewster> daftykins: geforce 7950... I didn't get the memo that they stopped making linux drivers for geforce 7
[23:36] <xius> so I'm trying to install 12.04 onto a partition on my mac. when I ran the installer, it encounter an error when installing grub. I decided to restart my computer holding alt to boot back into os x to research the problem, except rEFIt didn't load.
[23:36] <Brewster> and that is the only graphics card on the computer
[23:36] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, any ideas?
[23:37] <k1l> Kurukuru: check the url that is mentioned in that errormsg
[23:37] <k1l> Kurukuru: the ppa seems gone
[23:37] <Ben64> Brewster: you need to use a 304.xx driver for that
[23:37] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: Is there a reason you can't install grub from the console as has been suggested above?
[23:37] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: I've never used the NVIDIA drivers; I've been confident with Nouveau.
[23:37] <Kurukuru> k1l: So what are my options?
[23:37] <Brewster> I know
[23:37] <Ben64> jhutchins_wk: there is no ubuntu installed on the computer
[23:37] <Sara> where is it suggested?
[23:38] <daftykins> brb
[23:38] <Brewster> I was using the 304.xx driver before all this nonsense happened
[23:38] <L3top> Sara: load an ubuntu live disk... once loaded, please pastebin the output of mount
[23:38] <Ben64> jhutchins_wk, Sara: installing grub won't help without installing ubuntu first
[23:38] <k1l> Kurukuru: make sure you typed that ppa right
[23:38] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, Nouveau causes an complete PC hangup on my laptop.
[23:38] <Ben64> Sara: ~~~Install Ubuntu~~~
[23:38] <Celso> Ben64 is right. he already realized that much more sooner than me. lol
[23:38] <L3top> Sara: better yet fdisk -l
[23:38] <Sara> tell me how to recover files after installing ubuntu?
[23:38] <Ben64> Sara: \\\Install Ubuntu///
[23:39] <L3top> recover what files Sara?
[23:39] <histo> Sara: Wait recover what files?
[23:39] <Kurukuru> k1l: looks fine to me
[23:39] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: I would switch my distro to something else then. Maybe Lubuntu or Xubuntu.
[23:39] <histo> !details | Sara
[23:39] <ubottu> Sara: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[23:39] <Sara> files that i had on my ubuntu before reinstalling windows and messing up with ubuntu
[23:40] <k1l> Kurukuru: remove the // at the beginning
[23:40] <Ben64> Sara: they're gone
[23:40] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, this problem is affecting every single 3.x kernel Linux distro.
[23:40] <histo> Ben64: No their not
[23:40] <histo> Sara: did you repartition when you installed windows?
[23:40] <Ben64> histo: they're* and yes they are. there is no ext4 partition remaining
[23:40] <nomodeset> exit
[23:40] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: Really.
[23:40] <jhutchins_wk> Ben64: There seems to be disagreement.  She had it installed, then she installed Windows.  Windows won't overwrite Ubuntu unless you try really hard.
[23:40] <Kurukuru> k1l: whoops yeah, just caught that.. thanks
[23:40] <L3top> Sara: unless you overwrote the partition... they are NOT gone... you simply cannot boot to Ubuntu to access and use them. You need to boot to an Ubuntu LIVE disk... then type sudo fdisk -l... and I can tell you what is what.
[23:40] <histo> Ben64: So the files are still there
[23:40] <Sara> I repartioned when i installed ubuntu in dual boot with win 7
[23:40] <Garr255> anyone selling btc for bank deposit right now?
[23:41] <nomodeset> quit
[23:41] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, i am currently using MEPIS 11 on 2.6 kernel, but I really need 3.x D;
[23:41] <Sara> ubuntu was on sda 4
[23:41] <Ben64> jhutchins_wk: there was a pastebin with fdisk -l and a bunch of other good stuff, ubuntu is most definitely not installed
[23:41] <Sara> its gone anyway im going to reinstall it again
[23:41] <histo> Sara: STOP
[23:41] <L3top> Sara... becuase WINDOWS does not see it... does not mean it is gone
[23:41] <Celso> people, but how the heck she on ubuntu live usb cant access the 300 gb? it says cant mout
[23:41] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: Are you using Ubuntu Server?
[23:41] <L3top> PLEASE BOOT TO UBUNTU LIVE DISK
[23:41] <histo> Sara: You can still recover your files using photorec
[23:41] <Ben64> oh my god you guys
[23:41] <jhutchins_wk> L3top: She's reportedly on some rescue USB.
[23:41] <Sara> ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ fdisk -l ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ fdisk -l ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ fdisk -l ubuntu@ubuntu:~$
[23:41] <Ben64> there is no ext4 partition
[23:42] <histo> Ben64: Will you please stop giving bad advice. You can use data recovery tools to save her files.
[23:42] <Sara> nothing happend L3top
[23:42] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, no, currenty using 12.04 LTS desktop
[23:42] <L3top> Sara: sudo fdisk -l
[23:42] <histo> Ben64: Doens't matter if the partition is there or not
[23:42] <L3top> fdisk does not work without root priv
[23:42] <Ben64> histo: ok fine, you do it then
[23:42] <Sara> http://pastebin.com/2qvyLpFU
=== gary is now known as Guest1093
[23:42] <SonikkuAmerica> Woozie: So going to Ubuntu 12.10 causes your NVIDIA card to go bonkers.
[23:42] <Guest1093> @seek alastair reynolds
[23:43] <histo> Sara: Please listen to me. Boot a ubuntu live cd imediately.  Install the testdisk package.  Use photorec to scan the drive and recover your files.     If they are that necessary. If you can deal with losing them then it's not worh the time.
[23:44] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, no, i wanted to say that I was trying to use 12.04. Only distros that fully works are these with 2.6 kernel
[23:44] <L3top> Sara, it appears as though you have chunked your linux install.
[23:44] <L3top> histo: if it was an ext4 partition... I find your advice unusable...
[23:44] <jhutchins_wk> histo: Does it occur to you to wonder how the files got erased?
[23:44] <histo> L3top: IT IS NOT
[23:44] <histo> you people really need to understand data recovery tools.
[23:45] <Sara> why i do that eveytime install windows. I did exactly what was written on boot repair page
[23:45] <jhutchins_wk> L3top: It does not appear that she has a valid ubuntu partition.
[23:45] <L3top> Sara: it has to do with the options you select for the windows install
[23:45] <L3top> Correct jhutchins_wk
[23:45] <jhutchins_wk> L3top: Check the pastebin.
[23:46] <Sara> all recommended option ididnot change anything
[23:46] <L3top> histo... I am familiar. actual recovery on ext3+ is... a time vampire... and never works. In my experience.
[23:46] <histo> Sara: if you told windows to use the entire disk this would have happened. Also windows overwrote the mbr.
[23:46] <histo> L3top: if you scna a drive sector by sector for headers of a file it doesn't really matter.  You're not understanding.
[23:46] <jhutchins_wk> histo: Note that there are two NTFS partitions.  That's not standard.
[23:47] <Celso> Sara, with 2 partitions, one for windows (ntfs) and other for ubuntu (ext4), when reinstalling windows, you only need to choose ntfs partition. never touch on the ext4 partition.
[23:47] <histo> jhutchins_wk: windows 7 uses a boot partition
[23:47] <Sara> windows does not ask about partition its preload
[23:47] <L3top> histo: the partition is gone. recovering an ext4 after a windows partition... is a thing of legend.
[23:47] <histo> L3top: No it's not.
[23:47] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: Are you using a Windows install disk or are you using a system restore disk from the manufacturer?
[23:48] <L3top> histo: source.
[23:48] <jhutchins_wk> histo: MSCE here, I agree with L3top
=== gary_ is now known as Guest55199
[23:48] <histo> L3top: I should clarify. You are talking about recovering the partition.  That will be an issue. But carving files out is not.
[23:48] <daftykins> MCSE too? :)
[23:48] <Brewster> so...
[23:48] <histo> L3top: since she asked how do i recover my files. I was explaining how.
[23:48] <Sara> no disk . its preload on my computer I boot into windows installation using alt+F#
[23:48] <Brewster> any words of advice?
[23:49] <jhutchins_wk> daftykins: And dyslexic to boot!
[23:49] <jhutchins_wk> Bingo.
[23:49] <daftykins> jhutchins_wk: :)
[23:49] <L3top> histo, the files were wiped by a windows install... the partition is no longer there... this is not a recovery issue anymore imo.
[23:49] <Sara> and yes its from manufacturer
[23:49] <histo> Sara: Yeah that will blow out any partitions you previously created. They usually work by disk image
[23:49] <Celso> problem is detected XD
[23:49] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: That restore process is what's killing ubuntu - it's putting the disk back the way it was when you got it.
[23:49] <histo> L3top: You are missinformed.  Only some of the files have been replaced.
[23:50] <Sara> yeah i just need to know how to prevent it for next time
[23:50] <histo> L3top: mostlike the files for the linux system not /home
[23:50] <L3top> THE PARTITION TABLE IS...
[23:50] <L3top> sigh
[23:50] <L3top> histo: source.
[23:50] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: You should be able to reinstall Ubuntu, but if you run that restore again it will be gone again.
[23:50] <histo> L3top: WHO CARES ABOUT THE PARTITION TABLE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FILES
[23:50] <Ben64> everyone, relax
[23:50] <L3top> histo: soruce
[23:50] <L3top> source*
[23:50] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: You need some other way to restore Windows if you need to do it and keep Ubuntu.
[23:50] <Ben64> histo: recovery is a dubious proposition at best
[23:51] <histo> Ben64: L3top I will bet you both 1k that I can recover files from that drive.
[23:51] <Celso> Ben64, I have beer, eurodance music, so, more relaxed than this is impossible :P
[23:51] <jhutchins_wk> histo: The Windows restore wrote over the Ubuntu partition.
[23:51] <Ben64> even if some files still remain, they're likely to be fragmented and unusable
[23:51] <daftykins> A lot of you right now are making the person asking the question suffer by enduring your little domestic rant. Go and walk around for a while to calm down and let someone else take over so you're no longer letting your personality get in the way.
[23:51] <histo> jhutchins_wk: Yeap I know.
[23:51] <Sara> wll im trying testtdisk for now
[23:51] <jhutchins_wk> histo: No point in attempting recovery at this point.
[23:52] <SonikkuAmerica> Here, let me step in.
[23:52] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: testdisk is not going to help.
[23:52] <histo> Ben64: L3top jhutchins_wk This is what I do for a living but go ahead and missinform people.
[23:52] <histo> jhutchins_wk: but photorec will
[23:52] <SonikkuAmerica> What's the deal here?
[23:52] <L3top> histo: source. (ps you are not a source)
[23:52] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: Let me explain again:  The restore process os what killed Ubuntu.  Ubuntu isn't there any more.
[23:52] <Ben64> histo: i'm not misinforming anyone
[23:52] <histo> L3top: google file carving
[23:52] <histo> This is not some new technology.
[23:52] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: You can re-install Ubuntu, but if you restore Windows it will destroy Ubuntu again.
[23:53] <histo> Windows merely overwrote some of the disk. Most likely the first part where windows was already installed
[23:53] <Woozie> !google | histo
[23:53] <ubottu> histo: While Google is useful for helpers, many newer users don't have the google-fu yet. Please don't tell people to "google it" when they ask a question.
[23:53] <L3top> histo: to ask for a source, cannot be adequetely fulfilled by asking me to find your source.
[23:53] <SonikkuAmerica> What is this talk of destroying Ubuntu?
=== Sora1995|Cloud is now known as Sora1995|Cubing
[23:53] <jhutchins_wk> SonikkuAmerica: Windows system restore.
[23:53] <xius> so I'm trying to install 12.04 onto a partition on my mac. when I ran the installer, it encounter an error when installing grub. I decided to restart my computer holding alt to boot back into os x to research the problem, except rEFIt didn't load.
[23:53] <SonikkuAmerica> jhutchins_wk, that won't destroy Ubuntu.
[23:53] <histo> I really dont' care belive what you want to believe. If you are too lazy to google data carving I really can't help. I don't have the time or the patience to argue with you all anymore.
[23:53] <frowni> Can someone help me with slowing the mouse a bit :)
[23:54] <jhutchins_wk> SonikkuAmerica: Yes, in this case at least, it restores the original partitions and reimages them.

[23:54] <jhutchins_wk> histo: Please stop.  Unless she had personal data on the system it's much smarter to just reinstall.
[23:54] <Ben64> Sara: why do you need to install windows so often?
[23:55] <jhutchins_wk> Ben64: because Windows.

[23:56] <Sara> dafty what kind of question is that
[23:56] <frowni> celso, plain simple one :P
[23:56] <daftykins> a genuine one
[23:56] <Celso> gskelling, your graphics card?
[23:56] <Celso> ok frowni, wait a minute
[23:56] <daftykins> Sara: i just don't see win7 getting affected that often
[23:56] <gskellig> GT218M and also intel HD1000
[23:56] <SonikkuAmerica> Sara: See my message query.
[23:57] <Celso> ok frowni, see this page http://askubuntu.com/questions/133611/how-do-i-slow-down-my-wireless-mouse?rq=1
[23:57] <Celso> wich one you are using gskellig?
[23:57] <L3top> histo... familiar... packages are not sources. I do forensic data recovery. I use helix primarily. I am familiar with carving. You are unable to provide a "how to" sort of source... because there isn't one, once ext4 is overwritten by windows. We are in different animal territory.
[23:58] <gskellig> celso well, I want to use both. With bumblebee (nvidia optimus for linux)
[23:58] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: Since the windows restore is always going to kill Ubuntu (unless you put ubuntu on a seperate drive), you need an alternative method like a good image backup - easy to do from Ubuntu.
[23:58] <gskellig> but by default use the intel one
[23:58] <L3top> It CAN be done... but... you need equipment and time and skill... at this point... this is not sound advice... and I do not accept at face value, you have it.
[23:58] <Celso> ok. i am not very familiar with the bumblebee stuff but try this: http://askubuntu.com/questions/123604/how-do-i-make-screen-dimming-work-in-ubuntu-12-04-beta-2
[23:58] <jhutchins_wk> Sara: I would recommend using avg instead of avast for anti-virus.  The windows system protection stuff is pretty good too.
[23:58] <Celso> i curently use vgaswitcheroo.
[23:59] <Woozie> SonikkuAmerica, thanks for help, got to go and crowl Internet for fixes, bye :]
[23:59] <blunted> Optimus on Linux, yayayaya thank you sara
[23:59] <Celso> frowni, did it worked?
[23:59] <gskellig> is vgaswitcheroo updated recently?
[23:59] <gskellig> I'm up for anything to be honest
[23:59] <gskellig> as long as its easy to use
