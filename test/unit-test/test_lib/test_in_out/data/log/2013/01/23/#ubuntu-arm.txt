[11:45] <czajkowski> ogra_: I hate to be apain but - http://ubuntuone.com/3Hmktiws4Z1qhaXs35B5PL
[11:45] <czajkowski> have rebooted it 4 times still stuck here any ideas?
[11:46] <ogra_> czajkowski, have you checked the a11y settings ?
[11:46] <czajkowski> ogra_: I cant get the dash up
[11:46] <ogra_> use the ceg
[11:47] <czajkowski> when I click on the big ubuntu bittn it just gives the icon text dash home so cant change any settings
[11:47] <czajkowski> ceg?
[11:47] <ogra_> use the menu on the top right :)
[11:47] <ogra_> the gear
[11:47] <czajkowski> all frozen :(
[11:47] <czajkowski> each reboot still leaves it on the page to enter in my wifi code
[11:47] <ogra_> try to cancel the wlan dialog, could be that it grabs the focus
[11:48] <czajkowski> narp :(
[11:48] <ogra_> you mean it doesnt take any input there either ?
[11:48] <ogra_> (for the cancel button)
[11:48] <czajkowski> nope wont cancel it
[11:48] <czajkowski> nothing seems to want to close for me
[11:49] <ogra_> that sounds like a completely frozen xserver
[11:50] <czajkowski> indeed
[11:50] <czajkowski> bit of a pita :(
[11:50] <ogra_> when was that installed ?
[11:50] <ogra_> recent images have a serial console running on the usb port
[11:50] <czajkowski> few months back
[11:50] <czajkowski> before xmas
[11:50] <ogra_> hmm, not sure when i added that
[11:52] <ogra_> you could try to plug it into a PC and check demsg for creation of something like /dev/ttyUSB0
[11:52] <czajkowski> ok cheers will do when I get a lull in work
[11:52] <czajkowski> thanks ogra_
[11:53] <czajkowski> need to fix it by fosdem times as dont wnat to lug laptop
[11:53] <ogra_> with the working rotation and todays xorg fix its nearly usable
[12:08] <janimo> FYI the Tegra3 Technical Reference Manual seems to be available in the nvidia dev zone/tegra dev programme. I just noticed today, it may be old news
[12:09] <janimo>  the realtek sound codec on the nexus7 has no public datasheet though
[12:10] <czajkowski> something hates me :( http://ubuntuone.com/0S97eFdCGOGC1Dk6mEeFlZ
[12:24] <ogra_> janimo, well, there must be something in pm-suspend that makes it work, i wonder if some sub modules are unloaded and re-loaded ...
[12:25] <ogra_> havent found the time to inspect what the scripts do
[12:25]  * ogra_ just uploaded onboard changes ... we now have proper docking in place
[12:25] <ogra_> and the power button will suspend by default
[12:26] <ogra_> janimo, did you upgrade to latest xorg already ? it makes input work in portrait
[12:48] <janimo> ogra_, did not upgrade yet today, looking forward to test the new x stuff though
[12:49] <ogra_> the "button 1 gets stuck" issue is still there
[12:49] <ogra_> but portrait works the same way as landscape now
[12:49] <janimo> I have been looking at the sound/suspend issue yesterday, no progess though, just seeing the different register values, comparing to android and staring at the code
[12:50] <janimo> ogra_, the button stuck issue is our showstopper
[12:51] <ogra_> well, i'm busy adding the preseeding stuff to the installer ... once i'm done with that i'll take the time to look into what pm-utils does
[12:51] <ogra_> i think it unloads many of the snd_ modules
[12:51] <ogra_> if we could mimic that behavior on first boot it might or might not work :)
[12:52] <ogra_> eeek, MS buys dell !
[12:58] <lilstevie> hm
[12:58] <lilstevie> ogra_: nasty
[12:58] <RaYmAn> isn't it only rumors still? And probably only a relatively small part
[12:59] <ogra_> i just read news that it was a done deal
[12:59] <RaYmAn> got a link?
[12:59] <ogra_> only german
[12:59] <Rjs> I noticed some touchscreen&grab-related patches in the xorg-devel list a few days ago, I wonder if they would be enough to fix the "button gets stuck" issue? (I don't know enough of the details to know...) http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.xorg.devel/34653
[13:01] <ogra_> RaYmAn, happy google translate :P http://www.golem.de/news/windows-lizenzen-microsoft-will-milliardenanteil-an-dell-kaufen-1301-97090.html
[13:04] <marvin24> " ... licenses for future tablets" ?
[13:05] <marvin24> I though Dell announces to quit tablet and smartphone business
[13:05] <marvin24> *thought
[13:05] <lilstevie> marvin24: android tablet
[13:05] <marvin24> ah, we failed in a booming market - let's try some dead end one?
[13:06] <marvin24> janimo: I started to package a 3.8 kernel for tegras
[13:06] <marvin24> how do I add modules to the ABI ?
[13:06] <janimo> ogra_, our sound is not modular, so unlikely it is due to module reloading
[13:07] <janimo> marvin24, adding modules? Does it error on build?
[13:07] <marvin24> (sorry for the dumb question)
[13:07] <marvin24> janimo: yes,
[13:07] <marvin24> it compares module file from old abi
[13:07] <marvin24> and fails, because new abi has different modules
[13:07] <janimo> marvin24, you should just add an ignore.modules or modules.ignore (I always forget) file
[13:07] <janimo> let me check
[13:08] <marvin24> I think this is defined already, but I'll also check again
[13:08] <janimo> I wish there was a global 'Never check ABI GTFO' option on kernel builds
[13:08] <marvin24> there is a ignore.abi
[13:08] <janimo> and always just bump ABI by default, as it is the case almost always in my experience
[13:09] <janimo> touch abi/3.5.0-17.27/armhf/ignore.module
[13:09] <janimo> but use the actual current ABI dir
[13:09] <marvin24> janimo: ok, thanks - will give it a try
[13:10] <janimo> I am here if you have further questions and glad you work on this. It would be great to have a 3.8 tegra kernel in the archives
[13:10] <janimo> and switch ac100 to it
[13:10] <marvin24> well, it should run on any tegra2 or tegra3 device
[13:10] <marvin24> if you tell u-boot the correct device tree
[13:10] <janimo> right, but test on ac100 first as we have the device and the developer :)
[13:10] <marvin24> sure ;-)
[13:11] <marvin24> janimo: btw, is it possible to build a kernel package on launchpad - I read something about a 4 hours limit ...
[13:11] <janimo> marvin24, it should be possible but I don't know if there are public armhf builders
[13:12] <janimo> I know I used to test on an internal PPA
[13:12] <janimo> ogra_, ^ ?
[13:12] <marvin24> well, I already build some packages for arm ...
[13:12] <ogra_> czajkowski, ^^^
[13:12] <marvin24> he he, that's done already
[13:12] <janimo> ah ok then. I did not know about time limit, although 4 hours usually was enough for panda and ac100 kernels AFAIK
[13:12] <marvin24> https://launchpad.net/~ac100/+archive/ppa
[13:13] <czajkowski> ogra_: you pinged
[13:13] <marvin24> I just don't want to fall from grace
[13:13] <janimo> nice.
[13:13] <marvin24> czajkowski: all ok
[13:13] <czajkowski> grand
[13:14] <marvin24> czajkowski: is it ok to build a kernel package on armhf
[13:14] <janimo> marvin24, neh just try and if there's a limit we should bump it up instead of penalizing the uploader
[13:14] <janimo> there may be limits so the ppa is not hogged but a kernel build is a desirable use-case
[13:14] <marvin24> I was told not to upload package which run more than 4 hours, that's why I ask
[13:14] <czajkowski> marvin24: it's not on my list of not to enable - but as long as it's not more than 10 builds and greater than 4 hours
[13:15] <janimo> marvin24, https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ac100/3.1.10-6.10/+build/3962084
[13:15] <janimo> slightly over 2 hours
[13:15] <czajkowski> https://dev.launchpad.net/CommunityARMBuilds
[13:15] <marvin24> janimo: that's not a complete kernel I think
[13:16] <janimo> you mean not completely configured ubuntu kernel?
[13:16] <marvin24> yes, maybe many modules missing
[13:16] <janimo> right, ac100 does not have full ubuntu configs
[13:16] <marvin24> it takes one hour on my dual core 2.6 GHz machine
[13:16] <marvin24> I just used the omap config ...
[13:16] <janimo> maybe a ti-omap4 build is more relevant
[13:17] <marvin24> and also enabled PCI (which omap doesn't have as it seems)
[13:17] <janimo> czajkowski, does that mean the ARM builds are not automatic based on a dput but need to be manually requested for each upload?
[13:18]  * marvin24 still doesn't get why we need to enable all possible modules instead of all useful ones
[13:18] <janimo> https://launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel-team/+archive/ppa/+build/4046784
[13:18] <janimo> yes over 4h
[13:19] <janimo> the PPA builder you linked to currently builds an origen kernel and it is past the 3 h mark. So building kernels should be doable there
[13:19] <marvin24> janimo: AFAIK, the ppa needs to be enabled one time
[13:20] <janimo> marvin24, if a module is really unlikely to get used on the ac100 feel free to disable
[13:20] <marvin24> I meant in general
[13:20] <janimo> we started with minimal but a lot of USB and network options are required for various people's corner cases
[13:20] <marvin24> e.g. you don't need all the regulators and mfd which are specific for each soc
[13:20] <janimo> and since it is a module it does not affect those who do not used them, just build time
[13:21] <janimo> right, if some options do not make sense they should not be there indeed
[13:21] <janimo> hw support for impossible setups
[13:23]  * marvin24 didn't count how many kWh he wasted already for building useless modules where the packaging failed in the end

[15:26] <xnox> ogra_: do we have serial number patters or device models ids for nexus-ses to destinguish 8/16/3g models?
[15:27] <ogra_> xnox, yeah, ask vanhoof or mfisch, i think they figured them out for the zenity installer
[15:27] <xnox> ogra_: ok. I'll just poke the source then ;-)
[15:27] <ogra_> you can request info via fastboot
[15:28] <mfisch> xnox: vanhoof did all that magic, but I think he used the partition info
[15:29] <xnox> mfisch: sounds about right.
[15:29] <xnox> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1563337/
[15:30] <xnox> ogra_: mfisch: fastboot getvar all output for my nexus7
[15:30] <ogra_> right, just grab the userdata partition and de-hex the size
