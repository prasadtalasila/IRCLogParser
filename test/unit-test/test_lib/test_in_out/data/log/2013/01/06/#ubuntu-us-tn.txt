[21:56] <chris4585> hey wrst
[21:56] <wrst> chris4585: how you doing?
[21:56] <chris4585> good, you?
[22:38] <wrst> doing well looking at routers, have any suggestions?
[22:43] <chris4585> wrst, nope, I use the modem that comes from the cable company
[22:43] <chris4585> I'm not a router guy
[22:44] <wrst> well we have about 10-12 devices that connect
[22:44] <wrst> so its a necessity but don't like it
[22:52] <chris4585> yeah
[22:55] <wrst> haven't decided to go with a good home setup or go with a decent wired router with an access point
[22:57] <chris4585> well our modem has a 4 port built in router, so for my extra connections I have an old linksys switch I think
[23:15] <wrst> no WiFi?
[23:15] <chris4585> it has built in wifi
[23:15] <chris4585> modem + router + wifi
[23:15] <chris4585> all in one
[23:15] <chris4585> and phone..
[23:16] <chris4585> but who uses a land line these days?
[23:16] <chris4585> lol
[23:25] <RagnarokAngel> anyone here root their android w/ superoneclick?
[23:25] <wrst> yeah I know chris4585
[23:25] <wrst> hey RagnarokAngel  galaxy s iii here that wasn't available for it
[23:26] <RagnarokAngel> shortfuse.org seems to be down
[23:26] <RagnarokAngel> and I can't find the binaries elsewhere
[23:26] <wrst> I think I used ginger break or something on my old phone it was a one click kind of deal
[23:28] <RagnarokAngel> I just don't understand how the only website with official linux binaries is down.
