[00:03] <xnox> no clue.
[00:03] <xnox> but Adri2000 one should not use  -std=gnu++0x  as it's not stable yet, and can break in the future.
[00:04] <Adri2000> I think the program itself needs it. at least I don't recall forcing that option in the package
[00:05] <Adri2000> regarding the build failure, I didn't notice something until now: the build-deps resolving outputs some interesting stuff about libav* packages

[07:08] <siretart> Adri2000: for some reason, this build installs both libavutil51 and libavutil52. that's bad
[07:09] <siretart> Adri2000: also, why the heck does your buildlog indicate that libavcodec-extra-54 gets installed? that is also not supposed to happen
[08:26] <siretart> Adri2000: yeah, there is indeed a dependency problem in 6:9.1-1. I'll fix it in 6:9.1-2. not sure if this will help your package, but please let me know

[23:56] <cjohnston> is anyone around who could take a look at my patch and provide me with advise?
