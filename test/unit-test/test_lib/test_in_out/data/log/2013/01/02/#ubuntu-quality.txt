[01:47] <tripelb> I was sent here because I have a nexus 7 to talk to people were putting Ubuntu on. That was 2 weeks ago and I see nothing can I find out where and when people are talking about that I have so many questions
[01:47] <tripelb> http://randall.executiv.es/raring_nexus7
[03:30] <Noskcaj> for next time tripelb comes online, put him in contact with a nexus 7 tester who can explain stuff to him
[09:43] <dtourond> Hello everyone :)
[09:46] <dtourond> 63 members online, but no one's talking..? Okay then.
[10:03] <amjjawad> phillw: you there?
[10:12] <dtourond> Am I the only one who's active here..?
[10:13] <amjjawad> DevonT or dtourond ???
[10:13] <amjjawad> You should have said your username is dtourond  ;)
[10:14] <amjjawad> when you need to talk to someone for example me, type his/her name
[10:14] <dtourond> It was DevonT before but after a while I got bored & logged off. When I came back it just automatically used dtourond.
[10:14] <amjjawad> so he/she should notice that
[10:15] <amjjawad> Ok!
[10:16] <dtourond> @amjjawad - so I guess we're the only two people who are active.
[10:16] <meetingology> dtourond: Error: "amjjawad" is not a valid command.
[10:17] <dtourond> amjjawad - so I guess we're the only two people who are active.
[10:17] <amjjawad> sometimes, users log in but they are busy or away
[10:18] <amjjawad> as I said on the fb group, people here from different time zones so it is better to arrage a meeting with someone before logging in ;)
[10:20] <dtourond> amjjawad - Yeah, that's true
[10:20] <dtourond> amjjawad - One time I was on an Anonymous IRC server (y'know, the hacker group) and it was just flooding with people. Almost every second there was a new message.
[10:20] <dtourond> I was just shocked at this, but don't worry.. I understand..
[10:21] <amjjawad> Glad you do
[10:22] <amjjawad> I must go now, I have some things to do :)
[10:22] <amjjawad> I will try to login later but no promises
[10:24] <amjjawad> dtourond: have you subscribed to the mailing list of QATeam?
[10:27] <dtourond> amjjawad: Yes, you're talking about the "Lubuntu-QA team" https://launchpad.net/~lubuntu-qa
[10:27] <dtourond> right?
[10:27] <amjjawad> yes and there is ubuntu qa team as well
[10:28] <dtourond> Amjjawad: Oh sweet! I don't think I'd need much help through Ubuntu
[10:28] <amjjawad> I have subscribed to both before and still getting the Emails. I must go now ... catch you later ;) dtourond
[10:28] <dtourond> Okay, ttyl :)
[10:28] <amjjawad> I'm all into Lubuntu actually
[10:29] <dtourond> Okay?
[10:29] <amjjawad> ok then, take care and cya soon ;)
[10:29] <dtourond> Yeah, same to you.
[10:29] <amjjawad> will sure do
[10:29] <amjjawad> bye
[10:29] <dtourond> Bye.

[20:02] <letozaf_> I'm not quite sure I found a bug
[20:03] <Noskcaj> letozaf_, whats the bug? i doubt anyone else has seen it
[20:03] <Noskcaj> also, how did you only get one bug for ubuntu manual partitioning?
[20:04] <balloons> hey Noskcaj letozaf_
[20:04] <letozaf_> Well for the armhf+omap4 image I chose to install  Basic Ubuntu Server and Ubuntu desktop, but when
[20:05] <letozaf_> I rebooted I only got a desktop with a background and nothing else
[20:05] <letozaf_> no icons no launcher nothing
[20:05] <letozaf_> hello balloons
[20:05] <letozaf_> :)
[20:05] <Noskcaj> letozaf_, interesting. ERMERGERD balloons is back
[20:06] <letozaf_> for the manual partitioning, what else should I have encountered ?
[20:07] <balloons> I'm back indeed
[20:07] <balloons> had a nice break
[20:07] <balloons> good holidays for everyone? happy new year if nothing else

[20:10] <Noskcaj> die ubot, die
[20:10] <letozaf_> let me have a look at these bugs
[20:11] <Noskcaj> i have a feeling i put one extra in, i'm not sure
[20:11] <balloons> so letozaf_ I think there's some more pending merges for the autopilot tests from you
[20:11] <balloons> if so, I will get to them
[20:11] <letozaf_> yes but the last two do not work :(
[20:11] <Noskcaj> balloons, there is one
[20:12] <letozaf_> there should be two: nautilus and evince
[20:12] <Noskcaj> i think i merged one of those
[20:13] <letozaf_> Noskcaj, for bug 1080437 this time it did not happen to me :(

[20:15] <Noskcaj> letozaf_, my point is there are many bugs, just keep a lookout
[20:16] <letozaf_> yes sir!!!!
[20:16] <letozaf_> you are right
[20:17] <letozaf_> but for the slideshow isn't it a bit early to report a bug, maybe the still have to work on them...
[20:17] <letozaf_> or do we still have to report this kind of bugs ?
[20:18] <Noskcaj> letozaf_, scottk made the bug as a reminder, i just add it anyway
[20:18] <letozaf_> ok I asked because I was not sure about it
[20:18] <letozaf_> so next time I will also subscribe the bug
[20:19] <balloons> yes, bug 1086034 is known

[20:19] <balloons> not an issue
[20:19] <balloons> err, well, lol.. typically it's not updated till beta/rc tim
[20:19] <balloons> but your right,m it is a bug :-)
[20:19] <Noskcaj> your keyboard problem, i sometimes have that, usually accompanied by no keyboard at all and what looks like a compiz crash. balloons i only do it as a reminder
[20:19] <balloons> yes, it is good to file
[20:20] <letozaf_> Noskcaj, is a war machine, I mean on bugs :-D
[20:26] <balloons> indeed!
[20:27] <letozaf_> so for the armhf+omap4 image should I report a bug ?
[20:27] <balloons> Noskcaj, so I'm updating the live session testcase finally haha
[20:27] <balloons> I know we were talking a little about it before xmas
[20:27] <balloons> the first part is to add instructions for persistence that make sense
[20:28] <balloons> you also wanted to create files, etc, to check the persistence
[20:28] <Noskcaj> balloons, i have no part in live session. i don't think that was me
[20:30] <balloons> ohh. gotcha
[20:30] <Noskcaj> while you we away there were other testcases that need updating i did find
[20:30] <balloons> did you add them to the list? I should probably archive our old work now
[20:30] <balloons> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/QATeam/TestcaseUpdates
[20:31] <Noskcaj> balloons, note the very bottom, i'm not sure about the ppc one as we might close ppc down and i'm not sure ppc server i possible
[20:33] <Noskcaj> and before i forget, can someone run an ubuntu daily install, and note when the (x) is at the top and when its not
[20:33] <balloons> the 'x'?
[20:33] <Noskcaj> yes
[20:34] <Noskcaj> my netboot re-write is http://pad.ubuntu.com/wfjvrAzFq2, my oem re-write is http://pad.ubuntu.com/hROELLDhue
[20:35] <Noskcaj> the oem needs kubuntu only updates, could we get scott to do that?
[20:36] <balloons> Noskcaj, yes ask scottk
[20:38] <Noskcaj> i have pinged him
[20:39] <Noskcaj> phillw, can you try getting the -pwerpc guys to follow gilir's orders, i gave up an my mac can't boot usb
[20:44] <phillw> Noskcaj: I cannot order to order people,
[20:45] <Noskcaj> phillw, "orders:
[20:45] <Noskcaj> * "orders"
[20:46] <balloons> lol
[20:46] <balloons> well, testing this failed open on raring
[20:46] <balloons> usb disk creator blew up trying to start
[20:47] <Noskcaj> lol
[20:47] <letozaf_> I had quite a lot of problems with usb disk creator today
[20:47] <letozaf_> had to use unetboot
[20:47] <letozaf_> :(
[20:47] <phillw> balloons: Ì cannot log a critical bug with Chromium, the reporting mechanism from Chromium fails and it needs to be reported upstream. Is michag or Chad back from their break?
[20:47] <balloons> letozaf_, btw, you don't need to use unetboot
[20:48] <balloons> you can simply copy the image straight to usb
[20:48] <letozaf_> with dd ?
[20:48] <balloons> yes
[20:48] <balloons> dd if=myiso.iso of=/dev/sdb
[20:48] <letozaf_> oh! never thought of this :) great
[20:48] <balloons> yea, really slick
[20:48] <phillw> Noskcaj: we have to run down problems in severity... a none working browser is pretty sad... one VM system not working against another is a another bad one.....
[20:48] <balloons> been that way since hmm 10.04?
[20:48] <balloons> not sure
[20:49] <phillw> Noskcaj: for your issue, do you have the ability to change screen resolutuion on the VM?
[20:49] <balloons> Noskcaj, so this 'x' thing
[20:49] <balloons> what all do you mean?
[20:49] <balloons> I'm in the installer now
[20:49] <Noskcaj> phillw, is there anything that does work for you? balloons, it seems to come and go throughout the installer
[20:50] <balloons> k, I
[20:50] <balloons> i'll watch
[20:50] <balloons> yep, it's gone
[20:50] <balloons> ok, you got a bug for this?
[20:51] <Noskcaj> balloons, no, if you could.
[20:51] <ScottK> \o
[20:51] <balloons> gonna check using 'try ubuntu' then install
[20:51] <balloons> see if it changes anything
[20:51] <Noskcaj> ScottK, http://pad.ubuntu.com/hROELLDhue is my work so-far, if you could finish it?
[20:51] <balloons> hey ScottK
[20:51] <Noskcaj> balloons, good idea
[20:51] <phillw> Noskcaj: I got tied up on kvm bug, for which we have a workaround, I cannot test every testing system against all VM systems. I am pleased to see that the testdrive guys are also looking into your issues.... You better make sure the bug reports are there for them :D
[20:52] <Noskcaj> phillw, yep, everything thats actually a bug is one, everything else is in the email
[20:52] <phillw> Noskcaj: they need bug reports for each... the bug
[20:52] <phillw> & wish lists
[20:52] <Noskcaj> phillw, ok, i will make them now
[20:52] <ScottK> Noskcaj: I don't have time to write the test case, but I can get it into the system if someone does.
[20:53] <phillw> Noskcaj: you have to give the devs bug's to close, else their work does not count :D
[20:54] <Noskcaj> phillw, ok.
[20:54] <Noskcaj> ScottK, i was hoping you would at least know what to do for it. balloons, phillw or myself could upload it anyway. i guess i will try and finish it
[20:55] <ScottK> Sorry.  Quite busy with $work ATM.
[20:56] <Noskcaj> ok
[20:56] <balloons> Noskcaj, hmm.. actually I think it's ok
[20:57] <Noskcaj> balloons, what is?
[20:57] <balloons> so, what's happening is that it doesn't want you to killl the installer once you start making disk changes
[20:57] <balloons> that's what's happening
[20:58] <Noskcaj> oh, never mind then. but it has the x at the restart prompt, i wonder what happens if its clicked
[20:58] <balloons> hehe
[20:58] <balloons> well, if it's only the installer it would close
[20:58] <Noskcaj> ok
[20:59] <Noskcaj> on another unrelated topic, how can i get ubuntu on a hiapad hi802 / zealz gk802?
[21:03] <balloons> Noskcaj, if googling doesn't present some images / instruction my guess is to start with the basic core image
[21:03] <phillw> balloons: if you just want to log ##phillw - it's PPC stuff which may be useful when I bring Noskcaj up to speed on a request he has made
[21:05] <balloons> or arm image, depending
[21:05] <balloons> what instructions set does it support?
[21:05] <balloons> btw -- asking on #ubuntu-arm may help
[21:06] <Noskcaj> balloons, i did, they dodged the question
[21:09] <balloons> ahh, well, that might be the asnwer
[21:09] <balloons> heh
[21:09] <balloons> see what happens when you get it
[21:16] <letozaf_> I wanted to carry out the Ubuntuone tests, but the testcase: ubuntuone-client/ubo-001 that checks that the Ubuntuone client can be installed must be "old" I mean on a Raring fresh install it's already installed
[21:17] <letozaf_> maybe the testcase should be updated
[21:17] <Noskcaj> balloons, am i ok to upload the slightly edited oem install?
[21:18] <balloons> ahh I see it
[21:18] <balloons> yes, go ahead
[21:19] <balloons> err well
[21:19] <balloons> hmm
[21:19] <Noskcaj> the highlighted bits are my only changes
[21:19] <balloons> http://lubuntu.com/ doesn't exist
[21:19] <balloons> only http://lubuntu.net.. no redirect :-(
[21:20] <balloons> yea, go ahead though
[21:20] <balloons> I was looking at this line        <dt>Launch 'firefox' and navigate to http://www.FAMILY.com</dt>
[21:20] <balloons>                 <dd>The FAMILY homepage is loaded and displays properly</dd>
[21:20] <Noskcaj> ok
[21:21] <balloons> ok, so the netboot changes
[21:22] <balloons> anyone having issues with apport not sending bug reports?
[21:22] <Noskcaj> balloons, in raring? yup
[21:22] <balloons> yes, raring

[21:23] <Noskcaj> no
[21:23] <Noskcaj> and apport-collect doesn't work either

[21:48] <dkessel> switching the server to get package update from crashes update-manager on raring
[21:49] <balloons> dkessel, hmm
[21:49] <balloons> so, using update manager, changing the update server, then updating again causes a crash?
[21:50] <dkessel> yes. that's what i did. trying again after apport is done
[21:51] <dkessel> wait. apport is not working, right?
[21:51] <dkessel> mh
[21:51] <balloons> well, it's not pushing to lp yet
[21:51] <balloons> ohh.. I got a crash too
[21:53] <balloons> dkessel, well, let's get a bug filed for this if there isn't one
[21:53] <dkessel> balloons: lesson learnt: don't pop() an empty list :)
[21:54] <balloons> lol
[21:54] <balloons> yikes 10.4 mb crash file
[21:54] <TheLordOfTime> eesh
[21:54] <TheLordOfTime> oops sorry wrong channel
[21:55]  * TheLordOfTime hates laptop touchpads
[21:55] <balloons> my favorite: UnreportableReason: This is not an official Ubuntu package. Please remove any third party package and try again.
[21:55] <dkessel> yeah :D
[21:58]  * dkessel tries to find documentation on how submitting such a bug with apport files manually would work... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ReportingBugs#Development_release does not help...
[21:59] <balloons> dkessel, you can use ubuntu-bug
[21:59] <balloons> in this case, ubuntu-bug update-manager
[21:59] <balloons> make sense?
[21:59] <dkessel> balloons: ok - i guess you're doing that already now?
[21:59] <balloons> dkessel, yes :-)
[21:59] <balloons> but you can confirm and add stuff to it

[22:01] <ubot5> Launchpad bug 1095453 in update-manager (Ubuntu) "Changing download servers and updating crashes update-manager" [Undecided,New]
[22:03] <dkessel> so i just write: "Confirmed on current package versions" ? or is "confirming" something different?
[22:06] <dkessel> balloons: is writing a comment with "Confirmed on current package versions" enough as confirmation?
[22:06] <balloons> dkessel, confirming is to set the status to confirmed
[22:06] <balloons> it means someone besides the original poster confirm the issue
[22:06] <balloons> make sense?
[22:07] <balloons> once it's been set to confirmed it should show up to the bug folks and package maintainers to be triaged, etc, etc
[22:08] <dkessel> balloons: ah, right. it is only shown after clicking the arrow next to the package name. i confirmed. and then i saw that it automatically got confirmed because i also said it affects me :)
[22:08]  * TheLordOfTime glances because he can
[22:08] <balloons> ahh.. didn't know that actually
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> BugSquad sometimes says don't do that
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> depending on the package ;)
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> sorry, had to say it :
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> :P *
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> but in your case i think you're fine with what you did :0
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> :) *
[22:09] <balloons> not to reply and autoconfirm or ?
[22:09] <dkessel> :)
[22:09] <TheLordOfTime> balloons, to reply anyways
[22:10] <balloons> ahh
[22:10] <TheLordOfTime> but for the bug in question i think you're OK
[22:10] <TheLordOfTime> ... oops and my sbuild is breaking again :/
[22:10]  * TheLordOfTime walks off
[22:10] <Noskcaj> in raring i just got the error: "sudo: timestamp too far into the future: Jan 3 20:00:37 2013" the command then ran fine, what happend?
[22:11] <TheLordOfTime> dkessel, you did fine btw.
[22:11] <TheLordOfTime> your responding says "It also affects here, I can confirm it" works.
[22:11] <TheLordOfTime> usually just the initial confirmation is all :P
[22:11] <dkessel> phew :)
[22:11] <TheLordOfTime> but QA runs a tad differently than what i normally see as bug triaging, which is why i rarely touch $current_dev bugs :P
[22:12] <TheLordOfTime> unless i'm the one who is working on them (usually happens in cases of certain server packages)
[22:12] <balloons> yes yes
[22:12] <balloons> we's cause trouble
[22:12] <TheLordOfTime> :P
[22:13] <balloons> Noskcaj, umm that's not impossible
[22:13] <TheLordOfTime> balloons, hey, at least you guys find the bugs in packages that are at least coded semi-decently...
[22:13] <balloons> what command?
[22:13] <dkessel> TheLordOfTime, what server packages would that be to cause you some work? ;)
[22:13] <TheLordOfTime> at least you guys don't have to maintain php5 :P
[22:13] <TheLordOfTime> dkessel, not directly under server team purview but... nginx primarily, and php5-fpm related things.
[22:13] <Noskcaj> balloons, sudo apt-get upgrade. sudo apt-get update had ran fine
[22:13] <TheLordOfTime> outside of server, anything i say "I like this, i'll help" :P
[22:14] <TheLordOfTime> but generally i just do general triaging ;)
[22:14]  * TheLordOfTime returns to fixing sbuild
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> balloons, dkessel: the one thing Bug Squad, and particularly me, don't like, is seeing a thousand people post "I can confirm this" or "This happens to me."
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> two or three confirming things is okayish though ;0
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> ;) *
[22:19] <balloons> yes.. the "me too" posts!
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> its when you get a billion people posting on one bug.... :P
[22:19] <balloons> tacked on again and again
[22:19] <TheLordOfTime> mhm
[22:20] <dkessel> right, that's why "affects me" was created i guess
[22:20] <TheLordOfTime> mhm
[22:20] <Noskcaj> :( oem install, of all things has a bug
[22:20] <TheLordOfTime> me, if i care about a bug, i just subscribe to the bug :P
[22:20] <TheLordOfTime> although i'm already subscribed to the packages i primarily work with :P
[22:22] <Noskcaj> the series name you input changes nothing, at least in Vbox
[22:29] <balloons> Noskcaj, what do you mean
[22:29] <balloons> I should do an oem install again.. haven't done one yet this cycle
[22:29] <balloons> heh
[22:29] <TheLordOfTime> whoo, Lubuntu's running smoothly in VM, compared to Ubuntu
[22:30] <TheLordOfTime> Unity's a resource hog for VM testing of things :P
[22:30] <phillw> TheLordOfTime: the reason you hate that is because it raises the bug heat and actually makes someone pull their finger out and have a look at it :P
[22:30] <TheLordOfTime> phillw, actually, i don't like it because it causes autoconfirms and then we have to actually ask for apport information or more info for when there's not enough
[22:30] <TheLordOfTime> or they file against the wrong package
[22:30] <TheLordOfTime> and need some talking to.
[22:31] <TheLordOfTime> oh, and my FAVORITE thing for bug workarounds that I just absolutely want to slap people for: "Manually downgrade the libraries to a prior release's version!"
[22:31] <TheLordOfTime> i aplogize for the ranting, i should be ranting in a secret channel soemwhere :P
[22:31] <Noskcaj> balloons, let me get the bug report finished and you will hopefully understand
[22:33] <phillw> TheLordOfTime: we have to deal with humans, if you would stop beating the daleks up.... we would not have these problems :P
[22:35] <Noskcaj> bug 1095465
[22:35] <ubot5> bug 1095465 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "Ubuntu raring oem install series name is ignored" [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1095465
[22:36] <phillw> TheLordOfTime: then, my suggestion is to file a bug against bug-report and dis-allow you guys being pinged against a bug until a bug has the apport information, until that point it should simply show as 'incomplete'.
[22:37] <TheLordOfTime> phillw, most of those that i see are server-team subscribed :P
[22:39] <phillw> TheLordOfTime: then, please raise a bug! I'd love to confirm it from desktop side (I get all the lubuntu related ones, such as browser, media palyer... etc).
[22:39] <TheLordOfTime> phillw, moment i find one i usually file it
[22:39] <TheLordOfTime> unless its an issue of PEBKAC and my own fault :P
[22:40] <phillw> TheLordOfTime: you're just picky :P try the DE bugs :D
[22:40] <dkessel> DE?
[22:40] <TheLordOfTime> desktop environment?
[22:40] <TheLordOfTime> or are you talking about the german bugs :P
[22:40] <phillw> dkessel:  ^^
[22:40] <phillw> lol
[22:41]  * phillw nicotine break
