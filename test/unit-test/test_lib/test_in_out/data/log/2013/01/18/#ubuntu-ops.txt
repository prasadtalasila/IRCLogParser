[01:15] <Fuchs> seems to like me a bit, sorry for that, but I have no clue who he is
[01:16] <Myrtti> ah, noted
[01:17] <Fuchs> actually the only query I can find with him is 7 months old, and I was helping him ... odd. Sorry for the noise.

[21:37] <topyli> talking to christopherng from -ot. he's an "old member" and "its weekend ffs" and so on. let's see how it goes when the mute is over
[21:53] <em> Hi there.
[21:54] <em> Ive noticed a few things -- I am banned in #ubuntu for one thing. When is that going to be lifted and could I get an explanation on that?
[21:54] <em> Also I was in #ubuntu-offtopic about a week ago, for several days and suddenly was banned there. Can I get an explanation on that?
[21:56] <em> I would like to get a statement about how long I have been banned in #ubuntu
[21:56] <em> As well as a detailed justification for it. Thank you :)
[22:55] <AlanBell> hi em, thanks for coming back again, I will look up the details
[22:57] <AlanBell> em: so the recent ban in -offtopic was because there was already a ban there from some time ago and the ban mask was adjusted to make it work correctly, so this wasn't a new ban and we need to go back and discuss the original reasons for that one
[22:59] <AlanBell> I think you have been banned since Feb 04 2012 17:31:28 in #ubuntu
[23:02] <AlanBell> it appears your ban in #ubuntu-offtopic dates back to some point prior to Jan 30 2010
[23:06] <AlanBell> http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2012/08/24/%23ubuntu-ops.html#t16:38 is the logs from the last time we discussed your ban in #ubuntu, please re-read that because I wouldn't want to waste any of your time by having a repetition of that conversation with the same outcome.
[23:08] <AlanBell> all the way to 18:19 would be good
