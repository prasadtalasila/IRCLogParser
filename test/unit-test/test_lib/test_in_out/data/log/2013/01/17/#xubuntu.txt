[02:46] <craigbass1976> Where is keyboard information stored?  I had a good numpad setup working, then wiped my laptop.  I've got my home directory saved though.
[02:48] <drc> First place I'd look is file:///home/$USER/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts.xml
[02:51] <craigbass1976> drc, actually...  I just realized I'd already copied the whole .config/xfce4 directory over.  Not the same laptop, but they're both Acer Aspires, so I thought it'd be fine.  Not so.  The laptop it DID come from though... I've also copied the directory over there and that number pad isn't working right either.
[02:51] <craigbass1976> I  want to hit Shift and Home (also 7) to hightlight where I am back to the beginning of a line.  With numlock off, the 7 key brings me Home.  With Shift, it types a 7.
[03:41] <chia> hi everyone. from far east.
[03:42] <holstein> chia: cheers!
[03:43] <chia> i ran into a driver problem of intel graphics installing ubuntu studio, so their channel people suggest me with xubuntu.
[03:44] <chia> well i have to say i hate unity and prefer kde more.
[03:45] <holstein> chia: i suggested removing ubuntustudio from the equation
[03:45] <holstein> make sure that its a 64bit kernel driver support issue
[03:46] <chia> did you mean, that 'studio' doest not equal 'you have to make art with this'
[03:46] <holstein> chia: try 64bit kubuntu
[03:47] <chia> i tried 64 bit ubuntu and everything is ok.
[03:47] <holstein> chia: cool.. that is news to me
[03:47] <chia> and yes i am downloading xubuntu 1210 64bit.
[03:47] <chia> about to finish in some minutes.
[03:49] <chia> well, can it because of being installed to an usb harddrive?
[03:53] <holstein> chia: anything is possible.. but no
[03:56] <chia> and another problem that has been nightmare for me since the first time i install ubuntu/fedora...all those distros:
[03:56] <chia> the OS consumes too much power.
[03:57] <chia> using windows i can limit my cpufreq to 1.2GHz
[03:58] <chia> and tune to 3.2GHz when needed
[03:58] <chia> i tried sites, forums, tutorials
[03:58] <holstein> chia: your hardware vendor is free to create drivers for linux as they have for windows
[03:59] <holstein> chia: jupiter is a good place to start
[03:59] <chia> as you have said, intel is supported, and processor speed scaling should always be supported.
[04:00] <chia> but no one wants to tweak the settings via terminal
[04:01] <ImDoT> hey guys. does anyone know how to install the steam beta on 64bit ?
[04:01] <chia> in windows you check for 'power settings' and choose a desired cpu speed, in ubuntu never!
[04:02] <holstein> chia: i do that often
[04:02] <holstein> chia: in ubuntu.. with jupiter.. the software i suggested
[04:02] <chia> okay, i m about to try that, in some minutes
[04:03] <chia> thank you again
[04:05] <chia> ISO burning
[04:14] <chia> installing xubuntu from livecd image...
[04:15] <chia> there should be no difference between installing directly and installing after trying out
[04:15] <chia> and i hope so.
[04:16] <chia> when dragging the windows the graphic is tearing, shows that no hardware rendering is available
[04:17] <chia> hope that wont happen after the installation.
[04:18] <ImDoT> hey guys how would you install the ia32libs on 64bit (12.10)?
[04:18] <ImDoT> the multiarch stuff  doesn
[04:18] <ImDoT> tt work
[04:19] <chia> cant help you much. i use steam only on indows.
[04:19] <chia> Windows
[04:20] <ImDoT> same here but thats the goal isn't ? finally getting rid of the MS crap
[04:20] <chia> so ImDoT, you install steam for games right
[04:21] <ImDoT> well yes
[04:23] <chia> my impression of linux stuff: strong, free and open source, lots of people helping you, but no one responsible for problems.
[04:24] <chia> however i still like it
[04:26] <ImDoT> that's one way to look at it. since you don't have to pay for it, i find this drawback very acceptable. after all this way you meet people that really like their OS. that's probably more than most window support team members can say

[15:35] <CosmicLogick> pardon if this seems a silly question
[15:35] <CosmicLogick> but would xubu run on a tf300t?
[15:35] <CosmicLogick> asus transformer android tablet
[15:36] <CosmicLogick> the cpu and ram seem like it should be more than enough
[15:36] <CosmicLogick> but i don't know if the hardware architecture is compatable
[15:37] <Guest87802> well, since android is linux-base, it may run
[15:37] <Guest87802> based*
[15:39] <CosmicLogick> mmm, but littler things, like the 10 point touch screen
[15:40] <Guest87802> what is the resolution?
[15:40] <CosmicLogick> 10.1" IPS multi-touch screen with a resolution of 1280x800
[15:41] <Guest87802> the resolution seems ok, but i'm afraid the multi touch won't work
[15:43] <Guest87802> i think it might help, take a look http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIYKKLX8lJM
[15:43] <CosmicLogick> ta
[15:43] <Guest87802> ta?
[15:44] <CosmicLogick> as in
[15:44] <CosmicLogick> thanks
[15:44] <Guest87802> you're welcome, just curious haha, what does ta means?
[15:45] <CosmicLogick> to most on the net, it's an acronym for "thanks alot" (even though it's supposed to be "a lot")
[15:45] <CosmicLogick> however
[15:46] <Guest87802> oh, thanks
[15:46] <CosmicLogick> i actually grew up saying "ta"
[15:46] <CosmicLogick> meaning, thanks
[15:46] <Guest87802> in my country it means another thing lol
[15:46] <CosmicLogick> ...?
[15:47] <Guest87802> it means "shut up" or something like "stop talking, you're boring"
[15:48] <CosmicLogick> lol
[15:48] <CosmicLogick> and where are you from?
[15:49] <Guest87802> i'm not proud to say :(
[15:56] <xubuntu315> my laptop specs- T2080 1.73 Ghz dual core intel, 512 Mb RAM, which Linux OS will b Good? IM first time Linux user
[15:57] <CosmicLogick> xubuntu?
[16:04] <Guest87802> who agrees that ubuntu is now a piece of shit and soon we'll have to pay for it :( ?
[16:05] <Guest87802> did you see? they put fucking ads in our files search...
[16:07] <holstein> Guest87802: please watch the language... whatever you might be able to or have to pay for from cannonical doesnt effect ubuntu
[16:07] <holstein> Guest87802: ubuntu is really the community, you and I
[16:08] <holstein> Guest87802: if you want to provide an ubuntu for whomever you choose, free of charge, or for a fee, you are not only able to, but encouraged. though branding it as "ubuntu" and using the term "ubuntu" might not be available to you since they are "owned" names
[16:08] <Guest87802> you're right, sorry, cannonical is a piece of shit
[16:09] <holstein> Guest87802: again, wath the language please
[16:09] <CosmicLogick> i'm not sure i follow
[16:09] <baizon> i dont understand?
[16:09] <holstein> watch*.. please and thank you in advance.. also, cannonical is funding many parts of ubuntu that this and all the communities take advantage of
[16:10] <CosmicLogick> red hat brands it's distro
[16:10] <baizon> why flaming around on a xubuntu channel?
[16:10] <CosmicLogick> however, the branding is removable by the community
[16:10] <holstein> CosmicLogick: im just saying, you have to ask to use the name ubuntu.. and get permission
[16:11] <CosmicLogick> ah
[16:11] <CosmicLogick> well
[16:11] <holstein> CosmicLogick: you might not be able to make "cosmicbuntu" and use the cannonical servers and support avenues officially without getter permission
[16:11] <holstein> getting*
[16:11] <CosmicLogick> you can use the name Red Hat either
[16:11] <holstein> CosmicLogick: that is resonable in my opinion
[16:11] <CosmicLogick> it doesn't effect much
[16:11] <holstein> doesnt mean you cant take ubuntu, and make your own
[16:11] <CosmicLogick> yeah
[16:11] <CosmicLogick> all it means is
[16:12] <CosmicLogick> you'll have to rename it
[16:12] <CosmicLogick> red hat ---> centos
[16:12] <holstein> CosmicLogick: it effects Guest87802.. if he/she doesnt "like" ubuntu, he/she can, and is encouraged to take it, and make it whatever he/she wants
[16:12] <xubuntu315> my laptop specs- T2080 1.73 Ghz dual core intel, 512 Mb RAM, which Linux OS will b Good? IM first time Linux user . Pls reply friends .Thanks
[16:12] <CosmicLogick> is that a bot?
[16:12] <holstein> CosmicLogick: i dont think that was a constructive conversation that was being instigated however :)
[16:12] <CosmicLogick> it just asked that question
[16:13] <holstein> CosmicLogick: it?
[16:13] <CosmicLogick> xubuntu315
[16:13] <holstein> xubuntu315: good is a matter of opinion.. i would try xubuntu live.. as well as other distros
[16:13] <CosmicLogick> the ram though
[16:14] <holstein> xubuntu315: i run LXDE (lubuntu uses LXDE) on 512 of ram.. though XFCE (which xubuntu uses) should be fine
[16:14] <holstein> CosmicLogick: not sure where those nicks get generated from... maybe clicking "help" somewhere brings you here and gives you a xubuntu nick
[16:14] <CosmicLogick> there's a fedora lxde spin also, if you prefer
[16:15] <CosmicLogick> ah
[16:16] <xubuntu315> thanks il try ur suggestion
[16:21] <freedomrun>  is there a way to use lightdm to lock screen after some period of idle time instead xscreensaver?
[16:22] <holstein> freedomrun: i use a different locker
[16:22] <freedomrun> holstein, which one?
[16:25] <holstein> freedomrun: xtrlock
[16:25] <holstein> freedomrun: but, its not GUI at all
[16:35] <freedomrun> holstein, yeah I know ... for me that one is fine but for other people who use this machine it isn`t
[16:35] <freedomrun> they had a panic attack when I mounted that one :)
[16:38] <holstein> freedomrun: for the other users, the default one is likely fine
[16:39] <freedomrun> holstein, yeah but this screen never goes to sleep cuz of xscreensaver
[16:40] <freedomrun> even if it is setup to blank and xfce powersettings to turn it off after 15 mins
[16:43] <holstein> freedomrun: what would you like? there are other lockers.. and screensavers that lock
[16:45] <freedomrun> holstein, I am trying to do just simple locking with request for password to enter desktop again and no screensaver, just turn off screen while locked .. the feature that kde, lxde and gnome have ... nothing more nothing less
[16:45] <holstein> freedomrun: sure... i chose xtrlock for that.. otherwise, you'll need to try some other lockers..
[16:46] <freedomrun> :) thnx
[16:46] <holstein> freedomrun: i would lay out here your specific needs for the volunteers, and see if anyone has any sugestions.. bbl

[17:31] <karmakosmikk> hi, do you fellas know what is the problem, because xubuntu goes only for "terminal" login screen after installing?
[17:31] <karmakosmikk> and when I put username and pass then it does actually nothing
[17:36] <holstein> karmakosmikk: nothing? does it log you in?
[17:36] <holstein> karmakosmikk: did you get to a desktop from the live CD?
[17:36] <karmakosmikk> not to desktop
[17:36] <karmakosmikk> only black screen and some text
[17:37] <karmakosmikk> like loading texts
[17:37] <holstein> karmakosmikk: i would take the live CD.. boot it... right after the bios screens, tap or hold shift
[17:37] <karmakosmikk> it is netbook so no cd-rom
[17:37] <holstein> when you see a menu, at the bottom there is an F6 option.. select "nomodeset" and try booting the desktop live
[17:37] <karmakosmikk> used unetbootin to create usb
[17:37] <holstein> karmakosmikk: sure.. from usb or whatever
[17:39] <karmakosmikk> it just says "welcome to ubuntu" and 0 pakages can be updated , 0 updates are security updates. thats what i get
[17:39] <holstein> karmakosmikk: sure.. thats logged in
[17:39] <holstein> karmakosmikk: you are logged into text mode.. not sure why,
[17:39] <karmakosmikk> and only command line style thingies here
[17:39] <karmakosmikk> and waiting typing cursor
[17:39] <karmakosmikk> blinking and blinking
[17:39] <holstein> karmakosmikk: sure.. i understand.. and you *are* logged in
[17:39] <holstein> karmakosmikk: type "startx"
[17:40] <karmakosmikk> ok
[17:40] <holstein> and press the enter key
[17:40] <karmakosmikk> fatal server error: no screens found
[17:40] <karmakosmikk> hmmmm
[17:40] <holstein> karmakosmikk: so, boot the live CD as i suggested
[17:41] <holstein> karmakosmikk: see if you can get to the live CD using "nomodeset" which is safe graphics mode
[17:41] <karmakosmikk> i have xubuntu downloading right now because i assumed it installed via usb ok
[17:42] <holstein> ??
[17:42] <karmakosmikk> but it is soon there
[17:42] <holstein> karmakosmikk: what are you booting now?
[17:42] <karmakosmikk> xubuntu that is installed from usb to netbooks hard drive
[17:42] <holstein> karmakosmikk: use whatever you used to install xubuntu from
[17:42] <karmakosmikk> it said all is ok reboot now
[17:42] <holstein> karmakosmikk: fomr that *same* media, dont install.. just try live
[17:42] <karmakosmikk> ok
[17:42] <karmakosmikk> well i download that
[17:42] <holstein> karmakosmikk: if you are asking me "what wrong?" i am postulating, you have graphics hardware that is not supported
[17:43] <karmakosmikk> what is the difference with live and what i downloaded
[17:43] <holstein> karmakosmikk: OR, you have installed incorrectly
[17:43] <holstein> karmakosmikk: nothing
[17:43] <holstein> karmakosmikk: the difference is.. you wont install
[17:43] <holstein> karmakosmikk: you will boot it live.. thus determining if you can boot xubuntu on your hardware, and how easy that process might be
[17:44] <karmakosmikk> i can boot it liv
[17:44] <karmakosmikk> e
[17:44] <holstein> karmakosmikk: this will take your current install (which i know nothing about) out of the equation, and tell me and you if you can boot the os live
[17:44] <karmakosmikk> have done it
[17:44] <holstein> karmakosmikk: have booted xubuntu live? to the desktop?
[17:44] <karmakosmikk> lived it and then installed it in there
[17:44] <karmakosmikk> not yet
[17:44] <karmakosmikk> takes time
[17:44] <holstein> karmakosmikk: ?
[17:45] <karmakosmikk> now i dont have that iso in usb as i described earlier
[17:45] <holstein> karmakosmikk: i would put that in.. boot the live desktop.. install from there (or reinstall) and test again
[17:46] <karmakosmikk> ok i do that
[17:46] <karmakosmikk> should take 32 bit for netbook what have 1 gig of mem?
[17:46] <holstein> karmakosmikk: there shouldnt be a netbook specific one
[17:47] <karmakosmikk> yes but atom in here is 64 bit
[17:47] <holstein> http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04/release/xubuntu-12.04.1-desktop-i386.iso is what i would get from http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.04/release/
[17:47] <holstein> karmakosmikk: i would not put 64bit on a netbook
[17:47] <karmakosmikk> ok i take 32
[17:47] <holstein> 12.10 if you prefer http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/releases/12.10/release/
[17:48] <bjr222> just did full complete install of xubuntu on HP mini 210 2gb ram, 160gb HD, 1.6 Atom. pretty much a n00b with linux/ubuntu but i love the simplicity of it. im in the middle of the install yet, but wondering if WINE works in xubuntu?
[17:48] <holstein> bjr222: xubuntu *is* ubuntu.. which is linux.. wine works in linux
[17:48] <holstein> !wine
[17:48] <ubottu> WINE is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs on GNU/Linux - More information: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine - Search the !AppDB for application compatibility ratings - Join #winehq for application help - See !virtualizers for running Windows (or another OS) inside Ubuntu
[17:49] <karmakosmikk> wine does not run steel panthers anymore :(
[17:49] <bjr222> thank you
[17:49] <holstein> bjr222: wine *always* works fine in xubuntu.. its the specific windows application that might not work with wine that coud be problematic
[17:50] <karmakosmikk> so unetbootin should be good app for this kind of tasks?
[17:50] <karmakosmikk> or is there better?
[17:50] <karmakosmikk> tried to install bodhi via unetbootin and it hanged to the loading screen
[17:50] <karmakosmikk> when booted
[17:51] <karmakosmikk> just saw bodhi loading icon and thats it :)
[17:51] <bjr222> i only ask because my woman does online schooling and uses msOffice. she has her own laptop w/ win7 but i wanna play with ubuntu on netbook. just curious if we get in a jam with her laptop for some reason, will i be able to run msWord for her in desparate times?
[17:51] <knome> bjr222, i wouldn't count on ms word running on wine well
[17:52] <holstein> yeah.. its spotty, and can break anytime
[17:52] <holstein> bjr222: keep in mind, nothing prevents MS from releasing office for linux
[17:53] <bjr222> ok, well if needed down the road i will probably buy her a cheap-o walmart laptop
[17:53] <bjr222> thanks again
[17:53] <knome> i don't think there's too much done for ms word working with wine since there is open/libreoffice

[18:21] <lump|lump> by chance is there anyone about that is good with setting up this os on a G5?
[18:22] <xubuntu267>  <xubuntu267> hello my question for you is do you know default username and password for xubuntu 12.10 liveCD because the os logs me off unexpectadly and then asks for login information....
[18:25] <recon_lap> xubuntu267: try with no password, if that dont work, try really hard to remember the user and password you entered when installing
[18:25] <lump|lump> you might want to try "root" and just hitting enter
[18:25] <lump|lump> that is what I have had to do with other ubuntu variants
[18:26] <lump|lump> but have no specific knowledge on the actual q
[18:26] <recon_lap> no root user on Ubuntu
[18:26] <lump|lump> duh
[18:26] <lump|lump> right
[18:26] <lump|lump> not for a while anyhow
[18:26] <lump|lump> and i thought he met with just the live CD
[18:27] <lump|lump> sorry
[18:29] <recon_lap> xubuntu267: a live CD should not ask for you to login?
[18:31] <xubuntu267> it is live cd  i just hit 'try xubuntu' without username and password
[18:33] <xubuntu267> when it asked for login i just entered nothing but didn't work
[18:35] <bjr222> little help on installing fonts? when i try to copy the font file in to /user/share/fonts it simply won't allow it to copy
[18:35] <recon_lap> xubuntu267: strange , your sure thats whats happening. and have you tried on a different computer?
[18:35] <drc> I just tried with the 13.04 daily and "logging out" of the LiveCD session drops the user to the Login does require a login/password (and ENTER/ENTER does not work)
[18:36] <drc> I just happened to have a USB with the daily on it :)
[18:36] <recon_lap> xubuntu267: are you able to use the live cd and then get logged out? could it be a screen saver?
[18:37] <xubuntu267> no it  is 10 sec of black screen and then it asks login info
[18:38] <lump|lump> i have had live CDs ask that before
[18:38] <lump|lump> not sure if ubuntu still had root then
[18:38] <lump|lump> but the login was root
[18:38] <lump|lump> and the pass was just enter
[18:39] <recon_lap> xubuntu267: and your sure it's booting from the live CD ?
[18:39] <xubuntu267> sure
[18:39] <lump|lump> bbiab
[18:40] <bjr222> can anyone help me install a font?
[18:40] <bjr222> tried to copy in to /usr/share/fonts and it won't allow me to copy in to that folder...
[18:41] <bjr222> xubuntu267 what's your issue?
[18:41] <drc> bjr222: try using sudo
[18:42] <recon_lap> bjr222: you probably need permissions to copy to that directory
[18:42] <bjr222> im new at this and not very familiar with terminal commands. is there a command list or link avail for a n00b?
[18:43] <bjr222> i understand the sudo idea but dont know the specific commands
[18:43] <pleia2> you could also just install them for your user, create a .fonts/ directory in your home directory and then run: fc-cache -f
[18:43] <drc> bjr222: start with "man sudo" in a terminal

[18:44] <pleia2> I just wrote about this for FCM 67, see page 42: http://dl.fullcirclemagazine.org/issue67_en.pdf
[18:45] <recon_lap> xubuntu267: on a ubuntu cd the user name is ubuntu the password is blank on mint the user name is mint and the password is blank , googled it , might be right
[18:46] <xubuntu267> i ll try

=== io is now known as IdleOne
[19:16] <Lumpy> does anyone here know anything about getting 10.04 to run on a powerpc?
[19:17] <Unit193> Could try the mini cd of powerpc and tasksel xubuntu-desktop, see how that works.
[19:18] <Lumpy> I have an iso
[19:19] <Lumpy> just keep having nvidia issues
[19:19] <Lumpy> we will see in a few minutes
[19:19] <Lumpy> do you think it would go better with the mini
[19:20] <Lumpy> i mean providing i do updates, shouldn't it be like 6 of one, half dozen of the other?
[19:21] <v1adimir> Lumpy: gts 450 here (palit mode) using the nvidia-current, with nvidia-settings and no issues..
[19:21] <v1adimir> *palit mod
[19:22] <v1adimir> err both Precise and Quantal had no probs.
[19:23] <lumpX> well looks like i got it this far
[19:23] <lumpX> are we allowed two connects on this network?
[19:23] <Unit193> Yep.
[19:23] <lumpX> kewl
[19:23] <lumpX> well, i am letting it update
[19:24] <lumpX> and i can get it to boot so long as i use nouveau.tv_disable=1 in the bootloader
[19:24]  * lumpX is a total n00b to recent apple architecture
[19:25] <lumpX> i haven't had an apple siince the IIe
[19:25] <lumpX> and i am having the darndest time finding a distro for this G5
[19:26] <Unit193> If that doesn't work, Debian likes to support quite a lot of hardware.
[19:26] <lumpX> i tried a deb install early on
[19:27] <lumpX> but i have learned alot about these machines the past few days
[19:27] <lumpX> i am not too pressed about the accelerated graphics
[19:27] <lumpX> but i do want to have the sound working
[19:27] <well_laid_lawn> there is a #ubuntu-powerpc channnel that might be able to help
[19:27] <lumpX> both have been the stumble blocks
=== Catbuntu is now known as Catmint
[19:28] <well_laid_lawn> dunno how active it is
[19:28] <lumpX> now why wouldn't they mention that in that as the chat for help.. lol
[19:28] <lumpX> thanks well_laid_lawn
[19:28] <well_laid_lawn> cheers
[19:30] <lumpX> bbiab, reboot time
[19:44] <lumpX> well looks like most of the display issues are solved with xubuntu
[19:45] <Unit193> lumpX: What was it you tried before?  Unity requires 3D.
[19:45] <lumpX> easier q would be what i haven't tried
[19:45] <lumpX> and it was even funny with unity 2D
[19:46] <lumpX> i have tried, as far as desk env, gnome, xfce, and unity
[19:46] <lumpX> tbh, i don't care much for unity cept for on my netbook
[19:47] <lumpX> i have tried mint, ubuntu, kubuntu, slackintosh and a few others
[19:47] <lumpX> i think i have burned about 2 dozen isos
[19:47] <lumpX> i don't mind hacking things a bit
[19:47] <lumpX> just want the one that is closest out of the box
[20:01] <lumpX> and Unit193, i would /like/ to stick with xfce
[20:01] <lumpX> i have gotten rather fond of it since i tried mint
[20:01] <lumpX> and i use it on all my desktops atm
[20:33] <lumpX> for what it is worth, this time around is going the best
[20:34] <recon_lap> yaa!! :)
[20:34] <Unit193> Great to hear!  PPC isn't officially supported, but getting it to work is great.  Did you by chance try the Lubuntu PPC version?
[20:38] <Lumpy> yeah, i tried lubuntu as well
[20:39] <lumpX> i had it going okay in 2D
[20:39] <lumpX> but it didn't like me when I installed xfce
[20:39] <lumpX> which struck me as very odd
[20:41] <lumpX> one thing for sure, if I can't get the audio working, it is pretty useless to me
[20:42] <Lumpy> and I will miss having chrome browser but that looks like it is lost to the ancient architecture
[20:49] <lumpX> and I have audio w00t!
[20:50] <lumpX> now i am getting excited
[21:16] <roelofpieter> Hi there, new xubuntu user here. Can I ask a question about tumbler working troublesome on smb shares?
[21:26] <ochosi> roelofpieter: yes you can
[21:30] <roelofpieter> When using thunar to browse a smb share with pics or vids, it only creates 6 thumbs or so. I can not find others with this problem.
[21:33] <roelofpieter> Copying the files to local HD creates all thumbs. Browsed debian samba server and windows 7 shared folder. Both over ethernet and wifi. Problem also in archlinux.

[21:34] <lumpX> how do i get network places to show up in this 10.04 build?

=== NickRivers_ is now known as NickRivers
[21:41] <holstein> roelofpieter: i bet samba to samba would work better too
[21:42] <holstein> roelofpieter: using samba with a windows share.. i would expect some glitches like that... its not a deal breaker though
[21:42] <Unit193> I mount mine rather than using fuse, works better and faster.
[21:42] <holstein> unless it is...
[21:42] <holstein> lumpX: you mean a windows network?
[21:42] <holstein> !samba
[21:42] <ubottu> Samba is the way to cooperate with Windows environments. Links with more info: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MountWindowsSharesPermanently and https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html - Samba can be administered via the web with SWAT.
[21:46] <holstein> lumpX: also, i use gigolo to just mount and use shares
[21:46] <holstein> !info gigolo
[21:46] <ubottu> gigolo (source: gigolo): frontend to manage connections to remote filesystems using GIO/GVfs. In component universe, is optional. Version 0.4.1-3 (quantal), package size 140 kB, installed size 856 kB
[21:48] <lumpX> hey holstein not suprised to see you here
[21:48] <lumpX> i am not trying to mount local stuff as share
[21:48] <lumpX> i am trying to view shares on my LAN
[21:49] <lumpX> then again, i bet ya i just need a reboot for it to take
[21:49] <holstein> lumpX: i use gigolo to view shares on my lan.. or on the internet
[21:49] <lumpX> hmm
[21:49] <lumpX> they are not showing up atm
[21:49] <lumpX> maybe after i reboot
[21:49] <holstein> what arent
[21:49] <holstein> ?
[21:49] <holstein> windows shares?
[21:49] <lumpX> shared folders on my other machines
[21:49] <lumpX> yeah samba shares
[21:50] <holstein> you'll want to check out and setup samba... samba is not quite the same as a windows share.. though samba can see share with windows
[21:50] <holstein> lumpX: what do i do? i use gigolo to connect or test connecting to any share
[21:50] <holstein> lumpX: seems like you are looking for "network places" from windows
[21:51] <lumpX> something like that
[21:51] <Ronalds_M> just got rid of ubuntu 12.10 and installed clean xubuntu 12.04 on my laptop, liked perfomance on my old pc, and visuals..
[21:51] <lumpX> on my other machines "browse network" or "network" shows up
[21:51] <lumpX> but not on this G5
[21:51] <holstein> lumpX: from what, nautilus?
[21:52] <lumpX> no thunar atm
[21:52] <holstein> lumpX: correct.. but from before on other machines, thats nautilus you are referencing?
[21:52] <lumpX> though i could try and launch nautilus but would rather just get it to work in thunar
[21:52] <lumpX> and yeah on ubuntu studio, it uses nautilus
[21:52] <holstein> lumpX: or just install and use gigolo to mount, and then use whatever file browser you choose
[21:53] <lumpX> but irc, mint uses thunar
[21:53] <holstein> lumpX: mint uses different ones
[21:53] <lumpX> gigolo is installed
[21:53] <holstein> lumpX: there are mint versions that use nautilus, and the one they are making that is like nautilus
[21:54] <lumpX> kk
[21:54] <lumpX> i will poke about a bit more
[21:54] <holstein> sure, poke around... or open gigolo and point it to the ip of the machine with the share
[21:54] <lumpX> after my gal, kid and i devour this pizza and do the PTO meeting
[21:55] <holstein> lumpX: enjoy.. im sure whenever you are ready to connect to whatever you need to connect to, there will be a volunteer here to help
[21:57] <lumpX> likely, you guys do rock at that
[21:57] <lumpX> thanks and bbl
[21:57] <Ronalds_M> another point for xfce part of ubuntu community
[21:58] <Ronalds_M> cause ubuntu chat is always crowded, and people log in and out
[21:59]  * lumpX does rather like xfce
[22:00] <lumpX> bbl all have a great evening or day or whatever it is where ever you are

[23:03] <holstein> xubuntu948: i use airdroid

[23:36] <bernz> ochosi, the other day i was asking about fonts and stuff... well, one of the apps i used managed to clobber my system fonts pretty extensively. i looked into it, and it turns out that it created a "~/.fonts.conf" which was causing the problem. when i deleted that file and rebooted, all my original fonts were restored.
[23:36] <bernz> (i don't actually need that file, and if it contains something bad, it causes problems)
[23:37] <bernz> (and now i'm using "~/.fonts" to chuck in my extra fonts)
[23:37] <bernz> (so thanks again for your help :-) )
[23:37] <ochosi> bernz: great, good to hear! :)
[23:38] <bernz> i gotta say, i like xubuntu quite a lot. i was using ubuntu until lately, when i wanted something a bit lighter, and xubuntu was just the thing
[23:47] <ubu> help, i have xubuntu 12.10 x64...all good, but now /tmp size is only 1MB...what happened?  i can't update my system because /tmp is only 1MB
[23:49] <recon_lap> ubu , "/tmp" is a directory, how can its size only be 1MB
[23:50] <David-A> ubu: /tmp is normally a dir in /. it may be that your / (root file system, system partition) is full.
[23:50] <David-A> ubu: i suppose you mean 1MB free space ?
[23:53] <ubu> the "df" command shows my /tmp folder size is 1024KB
[23:53] <ubu> i've been using this system for months with no problem
[23:54] <ubu> now i can't update because /tmp is too small
[23:55] <recon_lap> ubu "df -h" , and what the % used , any near 100%
[23:55] <David-A> ubu: that /tmp is 1MB is not a problem. if update complains about space, it sounds like there is a problem with too little FREE space. exactly what is happening?
[23:56] <bernz> ubu, "df" == "disk free" ... tells how much free space on a volume ;-)
[23:56] <ubu> "df -h" % used is 52K
[23:57] <ubu> bernz, it also show the total size of the volume
[23:57] <ubu> i have 4GB free space lefe
[23:57] <David-A> ubu: that does not make sence. percentage (%) is never meassured with a K (52K)
[23:58] <bernz> ubu, indeed. you can also use "du" == "disk used" (also takes "-h" argument for "human readable")
[23:59] <bernz> look carefully, ubu, there are two columns "Used" and "Use%", each uses different units
[23:59] <bernz> (in your "df -h" output)
