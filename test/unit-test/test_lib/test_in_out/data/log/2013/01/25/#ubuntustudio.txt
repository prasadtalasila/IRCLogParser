[00:32] <say2joe1> is there a way to swap out the desktop environment (appearance) while keeping all the same menu / app listings found in the default xfce DE? new to customizing DEs in linux.
[00:33] <say2joe1> For example, I'd like to use a nicer UI (like Unity) keep all the menu (app listings) settings found in std ubuntu install.
[00:38] <len-1304> say2joe1, Unity doesn't really have a menu.
[00:39] <len-1304> Or, to put it another way, it is user created to feature just the apps the user adds to the side panel
[01:18] <say2joe1> len, thanks.
[01:20] <say2joe1> i'd like to have some sort of menu with all the exact same app listings as i see in the default ubuntu studio xfdesktop… just have a different appearance… something a little fancier… i appreciate why xfce DE is used by U.S. but want the option to switch appearance without losing any apps listed in the menus between two desktops.
[01:32] <holstein> say2joe1: you dont have to do that
[01:32] <holstein> say2joe1: ubuntustduio *is* ubuntu
[01:32] <holstein> ubuntustudio uses a lot of common applications that are in most all distros repos
[01:33] <holstein> you can use whatever distro you want and add applications, or use whatever ubuntu version you want and add anything from our metapackages, or just the apps you want
[01:33] <holstein> say2joe1: its likely, you dont relaly want/need ubuntustudio at all
[01:34] <holstein> say2joe1: you can however install ubuntustudio, and change or add *any* desktop environment
[01:34] <holstein> then, you will be faced with how that environemnt allows you to launch apps
[01:35] <holstein> most will just work
[01:35] <holstein> i would go the other way though
[01:35] <holstein> i would get whatever main verion you like and just add the apps you want
[01:35] <holstein> if you are just using audacity and a few other audio apps, you really dont need to bother installing ubuntustudio
[01:41] <say2joe1> i d/l'd studio on purpose for low-latency kernel when recording audio…. so, i'd say i have exactly what i want… just looking for easy "appearance" change.
[01:41] <holstein> say2joe1: the lowlatency kernel is in the repos
[01:41] <holstein> say2joe1: you can install kubuntu and add the lowlatency kernel to it
[01:42] <holstein> say2joe1: you likely dont need the lowlatency kernel either thouh
[01:42] <holstein> though*
[01:42] <holstein> i suggest just getting started, and add the kernel if needed
[01:42] <holstein> its not "magic", and if you have an internal sound card, that will be the biggest performance issue with your system
[01:46] <say2joe1> hmmm. the low-latency, high-audio priority kernel is important for what i want to do. and, have a distro with it included, equally so… i love this distro. a fancier desktop is the least of my concerns… i've already just tweaked some of the appearance settings for the xfce desktop env. which is fine.
[01:48] <say2joe1> in fact, i'm just as happy at the terminal as i am in the gui most of the time. but, don't use linux enough… trying to get to the point where i'm using it more often now.
[01:48] <holstein> say2joe1: i can help you determine if its important for what you do
[01:48] <holstein> say2joe1: what latency are you using JACK at now?
[01:49] <holstein> say2joe1: are you getting xruns?
[01:49] <holstein> if you are not using JACK, and you are not doing realtime effects or software synthesisers, then you dont need lowlatency
[01:49] <holstein> if you are using an internal sound card then that is going to be the biggest issue
[01:50] <say2joe1> i'm just getting back into it… haven't configured jack yet… but in form installations a year ago … had the latency tweaked.
[01:50] <holstein> say2joe1: enjoy it then
[01:50] <say2joe1> i understand about internal sound card issues.
[01:50] <holstein> say2joe1: just know that you *dont* need ubuntustudio to have our kernel
[01:50] <say2joe1> i want to be able to record and playback simultaneously. i play instruments.
[01:50] <holstein> we have it in the main repos, so you can just apt-get install it in any of them
[01:51] <say2joe1> oh! i understand i could get the kernel separate. but appreciate the packaging with ubuntu studio… exactly what i want.
[01:51] <say2joe1> … out of the box, so to speak.
[01:51] <holstein> we dont do any packaging either
[01:51] <say2joe1> the distro
[01:51] <holstein> the packages are in the repos
[01:51] <holstein> XFCE is the distro
[01:51] <say2joe1> i meant packaging figuratively.
[01:52] <holstein> if you dont want XFCE, you are missing most of what we are doing
[01:52] <holstein> but, do what you like
[01:52] <holstein> and to answer your question.. sure
[01:52] <say2joe1> i very much appreciate the work put into making this a great audio recording distribution out-of-the-box is what i meant.
[01:52] <holstein> you can run whatever environment you want
[01:52] <holstein> but, you are on your own so to speack
[01:52] <holstein> speak*
[01:53] <say2joe1> i've already read about why xfce was chosen and absolutely agree with the thought put into it… its about usability but performance as a priority.
[01:53] <holstein> if you add a ppa for razor-qt, and run that with our packages, then you are reponsible for seeing how things run and open with razor-qt
[01:53] <holstein> (for example)
[01:53] <say2joe1> … was just looking for options and opinions in this forum.
[01:53] <holstein> options are endless
[01:54] <holstein> opinions are just that
[01:54] <holstein> i say, run live CD's, decide for yourself
[01:54] <holstein> you can literally run whatever you want
[01:54] <say2joe1> hmmm. haven't read about razor-qt yet… still very new to customizing any linux distro.
[01:54] <holstein> say2joe1: razor-qt is just an example of something where you might see some breakage
[01:54] <holstein> say2joe1: i *have* testing our packages with razor-qt
[01:55] <say2joe1> i already installed ubuntu-desktop as an option. but, think i'll just stick with what i've done now with xfce.
[01:55] <holstein> tested*
[01:55] <holstein> unity doesnt have a menu, as len-1304 says
[01:55] <holstein> and i dont use a menu anymore anyways.. i just use kupfer
[01:55] <say2joe1> oh. yeah, not really interested in f*cking up what you guys have already put a lot of thought and time into… which is why i came here to get feedback before doing anything silly.
[01:56] <say2joe1> i guess i just still like menus… but times are a changing.
[01:56] <holstein> mess up what you like, its your box.. im just saying, dont expect anyone here to be able to help you with what you were asking
[01:56] <say2joe1> i understand. thanks.
[01:57] <holstein> you are asking "will the stuff i have installed show up in a different environment"
[01:57] <holstein> the stuff from ubuntustudio
[01:58] <holstein> the answer is, there is nothing ubuntustudio apps are doing to prevent them from showing up
[01:58] <holstein> the de you are going to will be in charge of that at that point
[01:58] <holstein> if its one of the big ones, you will have no problem
[01:58] <holstein> uinty has no menu
[01:59] <holstein> unity*
[01:59] <holstein> lxde will work fine, thought the grouping might be different
[01:59] <holstein> even kde and gnome should work fine
[01:59] <holstein> most of the other smaller lighter ones leave the menu's up to the user
[02:00] <len-1304> The trend in computer systems is towards kiosk functionality. Very consumer oriented. In Studio we realize the what we are really doing is development of content and so the DE is focused more in that direction.
[02:01] <holstein> more of an old-school desktop layout
[02:01] <holstein> its likely one will never use ubuntustuio on a tablet
[02:01] <len-1304> No :)
[02:01] <holstein> if they do, then we will have to reconsider
[02:01] <len-1304> It is tough already on a netbook.
[02:01] <holstein> ardour on a netbook... challenging
[02:02] <len-1304> ardour has not been the worst one, Mixxx is just not usable.
[02:03] <holstein> i havent tried mixxs in a while
[02:03] <len-1304> Some of the synths use a lot of real estate too.
[02:03] <holstein> i should.. is it good for synth work?
[02:03] <holstein> i dont do a lot of that, but i should look at it for support reasons
[02:03] <len-1304> I prefer mixxx? It is a DJ thing.
[02:04] <len-1304> s/i prefer//
[02:04] <holstein> oh , i see.. i though you were saying the synths in mixxx, and i was thinking of qtractor i think
[02:05] <len-1304> I prefer IDJC
[02:05] <len-1304> It is setup quite nice for internet radio streaming
[02:06] <len-1304> For a lot of development tasks (art included) two screens is pretty common now.
[02:07] <len-1304> My photographer friend was using two screens over ten years ago now
[04:45] <studio-user938> hi
[04:46] <studio-user938> hiola
[04:46] <studio-user938> tengo problema con el ubuntustudio
[06:16] <contrapunctus> Guys? Can anyone tell me how one sets up a MIDI keyboard, along with it's knobs, pitch and mod wheel, and transport controls, to control qtractor and qsampler? I'm totally new to MIDI controllers and need to try them out with my laptop in the store later...please help.
[06:43] <peepsalot> what are some programs that i can use to emulate record scratch in realtime?  is there a common device protocol for a scratch device if i wanted to build my own?  can it be done over midi?
[07:07] <holstein> peepsalot: sure
[07:08] <holstein> i would just sample it
[07:08] <holstein> or grab a sample, and trigger it/them via midi
[07:08] <holstein> i would ask in #opensourcemusicians for more
[07:08] <holstein> contrapunctus: it really depends
[07:08] <holstein> contrapunctus: its more about how you want the controls to be
[07:08] <peepsalot> i mean i want to be able to scratch/reverse/slow, etc any random sample that is playing
[07:09] <holstein> some apps like sooperlooper allow you to map easily by clicking or right clicking and hitting what you want to map
[07:09] <holstein> peepsalot: sure
[07:10] <contrapunctus> holstein: I meant, how do I assign, particularly with qtractor and qsampler.
[07:10] <holstein> contrapunctus: i would ask in #opensourcemusicians or in the channels or forums specific to those applications
[07:10] <holstein> contrapunctus: i dont use them, though when i have, i just map with JACK
[07:11] <holstein> im sure there is an easier way
[07:11] <contrapunctus> o.o
[07:11] <holstein> contrapunctus: i dont use them, man
[07:11] <holstein> contrapunctus: i dont use the applications.. i can dig around in the menus and find out how, but you could just ask someone in #opensourcemusicians
[07:11] <contrapunctus> No probs, mane. Thanks ^^
[07:12] <contrapunctus> Aye.
[07:12] <holstein> someone such as [lsd]
[07:12] <holstein> http://wootangent.net/
[07:12] <holstein> or poke around in his totorials and see
[07:13] <holstein> http://www.rncbc.org/drupal/search/node/midi%20mapping
[07:14] <contrapunctus> Heh
[07:14] <contrapunctus> Just had a word with [lsd] in #OSM
[07:14] <contrapunctus> lol

[13:22] <david__> anyone here?
[13:23] <david__> Guess not
[15:03] <famax8> hello?
[15:03] <smartboyhw> famax8, Hi
[15:03] <smartboyhw> Welcome to Ubuntu Studio Official IRC Channel!
[15:06] <famax8> smartboyhw:
[15:06] <famax8> smartboyhw: hi :) i htoguht there was nobody - how are things?
[15:07] <smartboyhw> famax8, hello
[15:07] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, what poped you into this channel? I thought you were an Kubuntu guy:P
[15:08] <famax8> smartboyhw: so i need to know where to find tutorials for using the different programs in studio but fierst which is what? i got hydrogen for my basic beats and still playing around and try to find how to work on the core of teh beat itself such as deepr bass or better kickc and so on
[15:08] <holstein> you need to wait in this channel.. there is a small group of regular contributors such as smartboyhw , and one of us usually responds in a timely manner
[15:08] <BluesKaj> smartboyhw, I'm also curious about ubuntustudio for my HTPC , but would it be overkill for my needs ...suppose this OS is more audio based than all media based
[15:09] <smartboyhw> BluesKaj, we are trying to have more workflows now:P
[15:09] <famax8> then i would like to find a fruity loop or cubase likke - and would like to have a deeper topic on JACK that i need ot combine each program if i get it right
[15:09] <holstein> BluesKaj: it is.. if you dont need JACK, and you are not making art, you dont need it
[15:09] <smartboyhw> famax8, which release are you useing
[15:09] <smartboyhw> *using
[15:09] <holstein> famax8: i say, you would be better off having never used those other applications you mentioned
[15:10] <holstein> famax8: the most challenging part of my transition was migrating to ardour from cubase and learning JACK
[15:11] <holstein> that being said, i felt as if someone had dropped a seriously expensive, high-end piece of equipment into my studio, and all i did was swithc to linux
[15:11] <famax8> smartboyhw:  i use quezal 12.10 USt
[15:11] <holstein> migrating *ever* little tasks was a challenge though
[15:11] <holstein> each plugin... etc
[15:11] <BluesKaj> ok , sampling looping is art ?
[15:11] <holstein> every*
[15:11] <famax8> holstein:  why is this? they are good programs suiting my needs u recommend any other soft?
[15:12] <smartboyhw> famax8, try https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuStudio/ProAudioIntro/1204 (though for 12.04 version mainly)
[15:12] <holstein> famax8: "good" is a matter of opinion
[15:12] <holstein> famax8: there are pletny of options to do aything you want
[15:12] <holstein> i think its fair to say, just as with libreoffice, the biggest issue is, its not word
[15:13] <famax8> holstein:  yes and alloow me to have mine hence my little addition "they suit my needs"
[15:13] <holstein> if you are looing for fuityloops, get fruityloops
[15:13] <holstein> if you are looking for cubase, get cubase
[15:13] <holstein> otherwise, there are litterally thousands of options
[15:14] <holstein> the one applicaions at the core is JACK
[15:14] <famax8> holstein: im not looking for these particulary but alike softs
[15:14] <holstein> famax8: sure, but what does "alike" mean?
[15:14] <holstein> famax8: there is no one looking at those and saying 'let me emulate that'
[15:15] <holstein> famax8: we have DAW's such as cubase
[15:15] <holstein> ardour is arguably the most well supported and popular
[15:15] <famax8> holstein: means program with similar features?
[15:15] <holstein> famax8: sure.. i'll let one of the other volunteers talk you through "alikes".. cheers
[15:15] <famax8> ardour works fine for me for what i do is even the best i found so far - was using jokosher but needed more tracks
[15:16] <holstein> famax8: ardour 3 will be released soon with midi integration
[15:16] <holstein> qtractor is a big one
[15:16] <holstein> check out #opensourcemusicians
[15:16] <famax8> holstein:  yummyyy!! ^^
[15:16] <famax8> qtractor is to mix only no?
[15:16] <holstein> you can literally open the package manager ans search "audio"
[15:16] <holstein> famax8: mix?
[15:16] <holstein> mix what? audio? midi?
[15:17] <holstein> its a DAW with midi support
[15:17] <famax8> holstein:  qtractor is a traktor alike?
[15:17] <holstein> famax8: i dont know traktor
[15:17] <holstein> they might not either
[15:17] <famax8> define DAW?
[15:17] <holstein> digital audio workstation is literally what DAW stands for
[15:17] <famax8> ah come on man dont be dull everyone knows traktor ^^
[15:17] <holstein> that can be difined many ways
[15:17] <famax8> ok so os a traktor alike
[15:17] <holstein> famax8: dull?.. i dont need to know traktor
[15:18] <holstein> tuples: i dont do a lot of midi.. i do "dull" acoustic recording
[15:18] <holstein> tuples: sorry... famax8 ^^
[15:18] <famax8> yes dont be uptight man ok you are a linux user and hate windows yet i beleive that you are not stuck in a cave are you?
[15:18] <famax8> holstein: :P :P :P
[15:18] <holstein> famax8: i dont hate windows, nor am i uptight.. but im sure one of the voluteers here or in #opensourcemusicisns can help you
[15:19] <holstein> famax8: i dont do midi, so i dont have experience with whatever 'trakktor" is
[15:19] <famax8> holstein:  thanks - now still anyone can exsplain me which program i cuold use to create a bassline?
[15:19] <famax8> and such
[15:19] <holstein> famax8: i grab a bass, and use ardour
[15:19] <famax8> and i use a dj console to mix but is under windows as i devlopped a vdj on it
[15:20] <famax8> oh right no softs for electro bass?
[15:20] <holstein> you can track a midi synth playing a bass line with the qwerty keyboard or a midi keyboard to ardour
[15:20] <holstein> you can use qtracoty
[15:20] <holstein> qtractor*
[15:20] <holstein> you can use yoshimi
[15:20] <holstein> famax8: there are 20 or so ways off the top of my head
[15:20] <famax8> qtractor seems to accept akai - nice
[15:20] <holstein> you can use hydrogen if you like/know that
[15:20] <famax8> but i want to create the whole bass electronically
[15:20] <holstein> famax8: JACK accepts "akai"
[15:21] <famax8> hydrogen will create only beats
[15:21] <famax8> jack i still dont get it
[15:21] <holstein> famax8: then you can "jack" the akia to whatever software you want
[15:21] <holstein> famax8: JAKC is the key
[15:21] <holstein> famax8: JACK is the core
[15:21] <famax8> is to combine all programs right?
[15:21] <holstein> famax8: assuming "akai" is a piece of hardware you own
[15:21] <famax8> i think is installed as well shall i start it everytime i compose?
[15:21] <holstein> you can "combine" anything to anythin
[15:21] <famax8> yes it is
[15:21] <famax8> so basically jack works as a reason
[15:22] <holstein> famax8: compose? you use JACK when you want JACK's funitonality
[15:22] <famax8> well u surely dont know waht it is lol
[15:22] <holstein> famax8: ?
[15:22] <holstein> famax8: you mean i dont know what reason is?
[15:22] <holstein> famax8: we dont support that here
[15:22] <famax8> yes
[15:22] <famax8> and no i know
[15:22] <holstein> famax8: i, nor any of the voluteers here need to know that, if you can relax about it
[15:22] <famax8> i just mean it works the same way as in u plug everyting to jack
[15:23] <holstein> famax8:  sure, but jack supports *everything* it can
[15:23] <famax8> perfect i get it
[15:23] <holstein> meaning, there is no commercial entity dictating what softwrae or hardware can be connected
[15:23] <famax8> is the interface so now if i want to use hydrogen for a beat - yoshimi for a bassline and sooploop or whatever the name for sample i need to have them all on jack and it will work together right?
[15:25] <famax8> it keeps on asking me to update is that noraml?
[15:25] <holstein> famax8: work together, or you can record them as analog audio into ardour, or another daw, or track them as midi into qtractor or rose garden
[15:25] <holstein> or anything else you want to do
[15:25] <holstein> famax8: update if you want.. i dont usually
[15:25] <famax8> ah i'll be crazy i will update ^^
[15:25] <holstein> famax8: you know the term "track"? as in to "record"
[15:26] <famax8> as in track yes create a track
[15:26] <holstein> anyways... as the AVlinux dev says, AVlinux is more of an appliance, and shouldnt be upgraded
[15:26] <famax8> u must be dutch or german innit?
[15:26] <holstein> famax8: yeah? why is that?
[15:26] <famax8> my girlfriend say track too
[15:26] <famax8> she is german :)
[15:28] <holstein> famax8: how about this... "where are you from holstein ?" then, i can not assume you are thinking i must not be typing in my native language, or that you are working on an inappropriate racial stereotype
[15:28] <holstein> of its that too uptight? anyways.. im in US.. north carolina
[15:29] <famax8> hahah no no is some expressions i work in communication environment i like to try to spot it that way
[15:29] <holstein> i find a most active and helpful community at #opensourcemusicians of folks who do more electronic stuff
[15:29] <famax8> no offense man
[15:29] <holstein> http://wootangent.net/ for example from my friend [lsd]
[15:31] <holstein> famax8: there are also a few arpeggiators that folks like to use for basslines
[15:31] <famax8> im goofing with what u said at the moment - acoustic+ardour adn i will rework the signal in a modualtor afterwards
[15:31] <al4nc4ds> hi guys
[15:31] <al4nc4ds> portuguêsinglêsespanhol
[15:31] <al4nc4ds> http://i49.tinypic.com/255527c.jpg some suggestion in ubuntu studio?
[15:32] <holstein> with JACK, you can route that arpeggiator to any soft synth on the system, or any hardware synth via JACK supported midi/usb gear, or to any other machine running a commercial os with soft synths you want
[15:32] <holstein> !info musescore

[15:33] <holstein> al4nc4ds: musescore is a nice one
[15:33] <al4nc4ds> holstein
[15:33] <al4nc4ds> thanks
[15:33] <holstein> http://www.noteflight.com/login too al4nc4ds
[15:34] <famax8> whic room is it for the musiscna?

[15:35] <holstein> finale notepad is free, and should work in wine
[15:36] <holstein> al4nc4ds: also, keep in mind, there is nothing about linux/ubuntu/ubuntustudio preventing finale from being written for it
[15:36] <al4nc4ds> ok
[15:39] <holstein> musescore is great and well supported.. clean, and simple.. though it does do notation as finale, it is nothing like finale
[15:40] <holstein> it is not tring to emulate finale either.. as a finale user, it was quite challenging migrating to musescore
[15:40] <famax8> jack can be found where? cant seem to find it yet it was there on live cd :?
[15:40] <holstein> thats why i am cautious or "uptight" about the "whats like finale?" questions
[15:41] <holstein> famax8: if you removed something, it could have been connected to it and gotter removed
[15:41] <holstein> famax8: open a terminal or hit alt+F2 and type "qjackctl"
[15:41] <holstein> if nothing is there, you'll need to install it
[15:41] <holstein> qjackctl is a GUI for controlling/starting JACK
[15:42] <famax8> its there
[15:42] <famax8> but cant find it in the programs lists?
[15:42] <holstein> i dont know what you have done to your menu, but i find "qjackctl" in the menu
[15:43] <famax8> where exactly? i found some jacks dev but not the same that u just toldm e to open which is the main one
[15:45] <holstein> famax8: i usually suggest trying the live CD and cliking on everything
[15:45] <famax8> ah ok is called jacl audio connection
