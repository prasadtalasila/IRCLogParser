[04:46] <cjohnston> bkerensa: bug #1098080 already has a patch, why did you mark yourself as the assignee?
[04:46] <ubot2> Launchpad bug 1098080 in testdrive (Ubuntu) "Testdrive gets stuck on "configuring Virtual Machine" if Virtualbox 4.2 is installed" [Undecided,In progress] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1098080
[07:39] <dholbach> good morning
[08:28] <popey> morning
[08:45] <dholbach> hey dpm
[08:46] <dpm> hi dholbach, morning
[08:47] <dholbach> dpm, I subscribed you on https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu-packaging-guide/+bug/1106351 - I'm not quite sure how to resolve it
[08:47] <ubot2> Ubuntu bug 1106351 in Ubuntu Packaging Guide "Not automatically deployed to developer.ubuntu.com" [Undecided,New]
[08:50] <dpm> dholbach, commented. Since the move to the new d.u.c server on the announcement of the mobile story we've had a few such weird issues. It wouldn't surprise me that this is also caused by that.
[08:50] <dpm> I'd suggest asking on #is
[08:50] <dholbach> ah ok
[08:50] <dholbach> thanks
[08:55] <czajkowski> aloha
[11:42] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, last session sorted out
[13:02] <cjohnston> mornin
[14:38] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: glad to hear we're done, anything else I can help with?
[14:38] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, no, I think we should be all set
[14:38] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, I'll write something up for OMG now
[14:38] <JoseeAntonioR> great then
[14:39] <dholbach> and then maybe a short reminder on the fridge which I'll share on the ubuntu/ubuntudev social media accounts
[14:39] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, did we decide what we were going to do about the hangout sessions?
[14:40] <JoseeAntonioR> erm nope, but I was thinking about starting them 3-5 mins before, and then the instructor that's before tells them that the next session is at ubuntuonair.com
[14:40] <JoseeAntonioR> then, when they pop in, it'll be all running
[14:41] <JoseeAntonioR> there'll be an [OnAir] tag for those sessions in the topic
[14:42] <dholbach> sweet
[14:42] <dholbach> we're all covered then :)
[14:43] <JoseeAntonioR> great!
[14:43] <JoseeAntonioR> now, JoseeAntonioR gets ready to go to school... in vacations.
[14:43] <dholbach> oh?
[14:43] <elfy> dholbach: announcement seems to be working fine - just over 1000 views
[14:43] <dholbach> yeehaw
[14:43] <dholbach> thanks a lot elfy
[14:43] <JoseeAntonioR> yay!
[14:43] <elfy> welcome :)
[14:44] <smartboyhw> Hey elfy haven't seen you for a while, how are ya?
[14:45] <elfy> ok thanks
[14:45] <smartboyhw> dholbach, the sad thing is that UDW is my sleeping time;(
[14:46] <dholbach> smartboyhw, I know :-/
[14:46] <JoseeAntonioR> dholbach: ah, remember to send a reminder to read classbot's instructions
[14:46] <dholbach> JoseeAntonioR, I sent it in a first mail already
[14:46] <JoseeAntonioR> let's hope they've read them :)
[14:47]  * JoseeAntonioR is off, getting late now
[14:48] <smartboyhw> dholbach, one thing I don't understand (probably you know more): When is balloons' on time?
[14:48] <dholbach> smartboyhw, he lives in Florida - or do you mean when his session is going to be? (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDeveloperWeek/Timetable)
[14:48] <smartboyhw> dholbach, first one:P
[14:49] <smartboyhw> dholbach, I do know when his session is (and sadly Autopilot is just too complicated for me---like manual testcases more:P)
[14:50] <dholbach> ok :)

[16:16] <snap-l> jcastro: yeah, but it runs like a dog over work bandwidth
[16:17] <snap-l> jcastro: 5 Finger Death Punch reminds me of army metal, or bro-metal
[16:17] <snap-l> The kind of "hoo-yah, kick ass and punch in heads" metal that some morning need.
[16:19] <vibhav> jcastro: ping
[16:30] <jcastro> vibhav: I'm on a call, leave me a pm or an email and I'll respond as soon as I can, thanks!

[18:22] <popey> works for me chilicuil
[18:22] <popey> that pad is blank by the way
[18:22] <popey> and I can see your name in the pad
[18:24] <chilicuil> yep, it's empty, I pretend to use it to acommodate some loco work, is that ok?, so.., then It must be my browser, I'll try with another
[18:31] <popey> yeah, should be fine, i dont think there's any guarantee of uptime tho
[18:34] <chilicuil> yep, it was my browser.., I'll open a bug in firefox nighty.., well, hopefully it will be more reliable than pad.ubuntu-uk.org
[18:36] <popey> that one was shutdown
[18:37] <chilicuil> wow, I thought it was temporal.., x_x
[18:40] <pleia2> jono_: I continue to get questions about when UDS will be, I realize you didn't actually say *which* monday you'd be blogging about it, but soon would be helpful :)
[18:42] <cjohnston> UDS will be... wait for it... wait... sometime in 2013 ;-)
[18:42] <pleia2> cjohnston: yeah, people are needing to schedule time off :\
[18:42] <cjohnston> I know.. I'm just giving you a hard time.. ;-)
[18:42] <pleia2> it's already too late for a couple people I know, but lots could benefit
[18:42] <cjohnston> Yup... I have the same issue
[18:45] <mhall119> pleia2: http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-s/ it starts 2013-05-06 and ends 2013-05-09
[18:45] <pleia2> someone should update https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SReleaseSchedule :)
[18:45] <pleia2> mhall119: thanks!

[18:47] <mhall119> pleia2: updated
[18:47] <pleia2> thanks again :)
[18:47] <pleia2> I'll still be on the other side of the world, but this is very helpful to people asking me
