[02:29] <roasted> hello!
[02:29] <roasted> do any of you folk run RAID on your home servers etc?
[02:30] <TheLordOfTime> yes, but its hardware RAID on mine :P
[02:30] <TheLordOfTime> not software RAID :P
[02:34] <roasted> meh
[02:35] <roasted> I don't think I could stomach hardware raid.
[02:35]  * TheLordOfTime points at the $2500 server box :P
[02:35] <TheLordOfTime> as i said, i run hardware raid.  :P
[02:35] <roasted> I'm considering on setting up RAID but I'm not entirely sure what to go with.
[02:36] <roasted> Some reading suggests that I can do RAID 5 with only two drives utilizing mdadm
[02:36] <roasted> which would be nice because then I can later add 2 additional drives and do 4x2TB in RAID 5
[04:01] <roasted> new plan
[04:01] <roasted> 4x2TB in RAID 10
[04:11] <ChinnoDog> waste of disk space
[04:12] <roasted> I'm fine with that, given that there's some admirable tradeoffs with performance and redundancy.
[04:13] <roasted> the more I read the more it sounds like 10 has largely taken over the point behind why a lot of people used 5
[04:13] <ChinnoDog> I never configure redundancy on home computers. I rely on my backups.
[04:13] <roasted> with the exception of the HDD space being a bit more limited with 10 vs 5
[04:13] <roasted> I have a mirror in my desktop, which is nice.
[04:13] <roasted> my server though will be running 247 and host a few different services, so having RAID would be a bonus
[04:14] <ChinnoDog> RAID 5 would be faster and give you more usable space
[04:14] <roasted> everything I read suggests RAID 5 is only faster with read.
[04:14] <roasted> whereas RAID 10 is faste rwith write
[04:14] <roasted> which, considering I'll be pushing backups to the server a lot, comes with a benefit.
[04:15] <ChinnoDog> maybe once upon a time with slow checksumming or if you had a really slow RAID controller
[04:16] <roasted> I won't be using a RAID controller.
[04:16] <roasted> I'll be using software RAID via mdadm.
[04:16] <roasted> RAID 5 pros, often faster read, more usable space. RAID 10 pros, faster write, overall decent performance, superior redundancy to RAID 5.
[04:16] <ChinnoDog> Well, unless your CPU is under 100Mhz...
[04:17] <roasted> considering I'm spending the same money for RAID 5 as I would be for RAID 10, there's no cost difference to me.
[04:17] <roasted> It's just I get 4TB usable space instead of 6TB.
[04:17] <ChinnoDog> Boot Phoronix test suite and do a benchmark
[04:17] <roasted> Which, my goal is 2TB.
[04:17] <roasted> software RAID (mdadm) hardly uses any CPU power to question it, to be honest.
[04:17] <ChinnoDog> I think you will find RAID 5 with 4 drives is faster than RAID 10
[04:18] <roasted> Well, maybe. So far I'd say 9/10 things I read suggest otherwise.
[04:18] <roasted> They do however say RAID 5 is often faster with read, but damn slow with write.
[04:19] <roasted> Some reports I'm reading are going as far as saying RAID 5 is obsolete.
[04:24] <ChinnoDog> I'd just stripe all 4. lol.
[04:24] <ChinnoDog> speed++
[04:25] <ChinnoDog> 64k block size
[04:27] <roasted> stripe all 4, as in, RAID 0 across all?
[04:30] <ChinnoDog> yup
[04:32] <roasted> well that sounds like it's asking for a nightmare :P
[10:25] <rmg51> Morning
[10:52] <JonathanD> Morning.
[11:50] <InHisName> Morning
[13:12] <teddy-dbear> Morning peoples
[16:57] <ChinnoDog> We are running low on morning.
[17:13] <InHisName> OK, here's another morning for you all
[17:14] <waltman> morning.
[17:14] <waltman> er, afternoon. close enough.
[17:15] <InHisName> So, ChinnoDog are you filled up enough with mornings?  Shall we get on with afternoons now ?
[17:25] <ChinnoDog> Yes. No more mornings for now.
[18:00] <InHisName> Good afternoon, everyone ! Bears too.
[18:34] <roasted> :D
[18:41] <InHisName> roasted: in January,  Hmmm, Is that an oxymoron ?
[23:16] <MutantTurkey> Back in Philadelphia

[23:17] <MutantTurkey> was my atom PC
[23:17] <MutantTurkey> it didn't have a dedicated fan though, just a fan for the box, so I took off that heatsink and added two more instead
