[02:55] <hackeribeat> You offended my religion I got mad
[02:56] <bazhang> hackeribeat, do you know the chat channel?
[02:56] <hackeribeat> No
[02:56] <bazhang> #ubuntu-offtopic

[02:56] <hackeribeat> Later on when I need iy
[02:56] <hackeribeat> It
[02:56] <hackeribeat> Could I be unbanned ?
[02:57] <bazhang> think about that next time before you start with the "I'm Amish" etc nonsense
[02:57] <hackeribeat> ?
[02:57] <bazhang> try askubuntu.com
[02:57] <hackeribeat> Yes / no?
[02:57] <hackeribeat> Why can't you unban me?
[02:57] <bazhang> yes or no what
[02:58] <bazhang> I dont see you needing #ubuntu
[02:58] <hackeribeat> I do
[02:58] <hackeribeat> For help
[02:58] <hackeribeat> When I get my laptop back from repair
[02:58] <bazhang> all you did was nonsense there.
[02:58] <hackeribeat> I sorry
[02:59] <bazhang> the bans will NOT be removed at this time.
[02:59] <hackeribeat> Later?
[02:59] <bazhang> possibly
[02:59] <hackeribeat> Please don't forget I need support when laptop comes back
[03:00] <bazhang> please dont forget that using the channel for nonsense, getting quieted, then banned, ban evading is not the way to get support in #ubuntu

[03:00] <hackeribeat> I sorry
[03:00] <bazhang> so why do it
[03:01] <hackeribeat> U offended my religion

[03:02] <bazhang> ok, well you need to learn how to use it
[03:02] <hackeribeat> Ok
[03:02] <bazhang> so askubuntu.com for your support needs.
[03:03] <hackeribeat> But I'll be unbanned though right?
[03:03] <bazhang> at this time, no.
