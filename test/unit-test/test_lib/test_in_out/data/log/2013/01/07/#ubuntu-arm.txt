[17:17] <prpplague> hmm, ok so who at canonical is in charge of support for panda these days?
[17:31] <infinity> prpplague: Define "support".
[17:32] <infinity> prpplague: Paolo still handles the kernels, but only for stable releases.
[17:32] <prpplague> infinity: i.e. who is the best person to coordinate with for the new memory configuration patches?
[17:33] <infinity> prpplague: Paolo.
[17:35] <infinity> prpplague: You'll want to file a bug against linux-ti-omap4 as well.  For bonus points, let me know what the bug number is so I can open SRU tasks for all supported releases (assuming you intend to make said patches work for 3.0/3.2/3.5)
[17:39] <prpplague> infinity: not sure if we need to back support the older versions
[17:44] <infinity> prpplague: Well, to precise, at least.
