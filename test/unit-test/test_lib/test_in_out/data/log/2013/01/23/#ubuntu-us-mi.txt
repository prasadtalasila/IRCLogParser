[00:44] <snap-l> Evening
[03:13] <rick_h_> <3 http://r.bmark.us/u/d9c1c7d41a22fc
[03:14] <rick_h_> come on ubuntu, do it!
[03:36] <snap-l> That would be pretty awesome (rolling release)
[03:36] <snap-l> Man, I love everything about the Rush Remasters
[03:36] <snap-l> Finally picked up the last one that I'm planning on picking up: Grace Under Pressure
[03:36] <snap-l> Finally saw it at BN tonight
[03:36] <snap-l> And it just sounds better.
[03:37] <snap-l> I think their early digital albums benefit from the remastering
[03:38] <snap-l> Signals has always been a sore spot. The Remaster makes it positively brilliant
[03:38] <snap-l> (yeah, I know I'm several years late to the party. ;) )

[13:40] <snap-l> ARe we having fun yet?
[13:40] <brousch> Almost
[13:41] <rick_h_> oh joy
[14:28] <snap-l> http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/post/41265135868/text-great-perl-photograph-of-perls-hello
[15:30] <rick_h_> bah! http://www.ispebbleshipping.com/
[15:31] <brousch> heh
[15:32] <rick_h_> :( email says they only got 500 going out today vs the 15k originally thought
[15:35] <widox> yikes, thats a big difference
[15:36] <rick_h_> We weren't able to get as many units to our fulfillment centre as we expected (held up by documentation at the airport). Less than 500
[15:36] <rick_h_> units are going out today, with more expected to ship soon.
[15:36] <rick_h_> so I guess it's not "they failed to be built" but failed customs...but still ugh
[15:37] <jjesse> apparently the factory isn't up to full speed for production
[15:37] <jjesse> boo on that
[15:37] <brousch> Storm customs!
[15:37] <brousch> Occupy customs!
[15:38] <snap-l> Remember, kids: customs is a legal entity unto itself.
[15:38] <snap-l> If you need something there yesterday, Customs will screw you.
[15:39] <snap-l> accept no substitutes.
[16:20] <snap-l> yay, chair arrived.
[16:22] <rick_h_> yay
[16:40] <snap-l> Oh, I like it. It's smaller than the big ball, and it has wheels on it, and a nice back to remind me to sit up.
[16:42] <snap-l> ANd it has casters, so I can turn it without having to get up.
[16:44] <snap-l> Now for the keyboard to arrive... ;)
[16:44] <brousch> So it's a ball with wheels and a back?
[16:44] <snap-l> Yeah
[16:44] <snap-l> brousch: http://ur1.ca/climp
[16:45] <jrwren> anyone have example code for a python fileobject decorator? (pattern, not python decorator)
[16:45] <rick_h_> not translating that. fileobject decorator?
[16:46] <jrwren> ya know how bz2.BZ2File() can take a fileobject as input? so that is known as decorator pattern and it exposes the fileobject interface so you can use it anywhere you would use a file object
[16:46] <jrwren> i need to do same thing.
[16:47] <jrwren> duh, go look at bz2file source :)
[16:47] <snap-l> Wouldnt' that work like any other decorator?
[16:47] <rick_h_> oh, I mean that's just duck typing on the input. Thing stringio
[16:47] <greg-g> snap-l: you *sit* on that thing?
[16:48] <snap-l> greg-g: Yes.
[16:48] <rick_h_> I think decorator as new func wrapping call to diff func. And here it's just a func taking a file-like input
[16:48] <jrwren> yes, just duck typing
[16:48] <snap-l> I used a larger ball that rick_h_ let me borrow. JoDee said I looked like I was incubating an egg.
[16:48] <jrwren> but i don't want stringio
[16:48] <jrwren> python3 yas bufferediobase, that might work
[16:48] <snap-l> Now I'll look like I have a nest as well.
[16:50]  * snap-l fully admits it's probably not doing what he thinks it's doing.
[16:51] <rick_h_> jrwren: yea, I mean you can look at what method BZ2File uses and just implement that on a class. Otherwise just implement the api of file http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/inputoutput.html#methods-of-file-objects
[16:51] <rick_h_> but doubt you need them all
[16:52] <greg-g> snap-l: :) hey, as long as it helps man
[16:52] <jrwren> io.RawIOBase is what I want, I think.
[16:52] <rick_h_> cool
[16:52] <jrwren> err, io.BufferedIOBase
[16:53] <snap-l> greg-g: I've always had a weak midsection, so the theory is to strengthen it. Whether that works or not and doesn't add to back problems is another matter entirely.
[16:53] <rick_h_> ball sitting can make you sore for a while for sure
[16:53] <brousch> snap-l: Keep me informed of your experience
[16:53] <rick_h_> have to work to stay on top of it right
[16:54] <snap-l> brousch: Will do.
[16:56] <greg-g> snap-l: blogzor it!
[16:56] <snap-l> Definitely.
[16:57] <brousch> With photos and video
[16:57] <snap-l> and hookers, and blackjack.
[17:14] <jrwren> turns out I don't want that. I think I want to write my own codec. http://docs.python.org/2/library/codecs.html
[17:15] <rick_h_> what?!
[17:15] <rick_h_> you just want to have your own object be BZ2'd right?
[17:18] <snap-l> jrwren: what are you attempting?
[18:21] <jrwren> no no, bz2 was just and example.
[18:21] <jrwren> i have a bad xml file and I want to strip chars
[18:21] <jrwren> but i want to do it in a stream read manner
[18:22] <rick_h_> isn't for l in open('file') lazy per line?
[18:23] <jrwren> yes, but I'm not doing that.
[18:24] <jrwren> i'm passing the file object to lxml parser
[18:24] <jrwren> http://www.doughellmann.com/PyMOTW/codecs/ is a pretty good tutorial
[18:25] <rick_h_> jrwren: ok, gotcha
[18:48] <jcastro> snap-l: this colonel guy is funny
[18:48] <snap-l> Bruce Hampton? Yeah, he's a character.
[18:53] <brousch> Here's your big chance, East Siders http://www.meetup.com/Michigan-Python-Development-Group/events/95260982/
[18:54] <brousch> Wow. 50 devs already
[18:56] <snap-l> INteresting
[19:23] <jrwren> sometimes I think python should be declared and utter failure of its objectives.
[19:23] <snap-l> OK, how so?
[19:24] <jrwren> well, what is irking me right now is that StringIO has no readable property
[19:24] <jrwren> yes http://docs.python.org/2/library/io.html says it should
[19:24] <jrwren> but http://docs.python.org/2/library/stringio.html says no
[19:25] <_stink_> oh man i think i've seen that before
[19:25] <_stink_> like it has a StringI and a StringO internal or something?
[19:26] <jrwren> yes
[19:26] <jrwren> so i get a StringI
[19:26] <jrwren> which is fine, input is what I have and want
[19:26] <jrwren> yet has no readable attr
[19:26] <_stink_> yeah crap
[19:26] <jrwren> so I can't actually wrap it with TextIOWrapper
[19:26] <_stink_> what did i do about that?
[19:26] <_stink_> i can't remember
[19:27] <_stink_> i know, i know, that's very helpful
[19:29] <jrwren> use StringIO instead of cStringIO and add the attr yourself?
[19:30] <rick_h_> is StingIO updated to StringIO is long before io module though I think. While the names seem close I'm not sure they actually are related at all
[19:30] <jrwren> the docs in io says they are
[19:30] <jrwren> docs could be wrong
[19:30] <rick_h_> probably me, I see io is 2.6. I thuoght it was newer than that
[19:31] <rick_h_> but still, pretty sure StringIO was before that, but it should have been updated to match I suppose
[19:34] <rick_h_> ok, funny http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkM6RJf15cg&feature=share
[19:39] <snap-l> Um, what the hell were they advertising?
[19:39] <snap-l> Hey, remember us? We used to be cool too
[19:39] <rick_h_> IE
[19:39] <snap-l> Jesus, Microsoft needs to shoot their marketing department.
[19:40] <snap-l> "Hi, we're the browser of nostalgia"
[19:42] <snap-l> "Hi, remember us? We're the browser you used to use, like POGs, and pump-up shoes. You got old, and we got old too. Friend me!"ï»¿
[20:12] <jrwren> apparently you can't wrap codecs :(
[20:13] <jrwren> so it was not the best approach
[20:13] <jrwren> easier to wrap/decorate read()
[22:02] <rick_h_> this line just reads so crazy: Apple Shares Drop 5.6% In After-Hours Trading After Q1 2013 Earnings, Shaving $27 Billion Off Its Market Cap
[22:02] <rick_h_> 27 with a B?
[22:02] <rick_h_> daaaamn
