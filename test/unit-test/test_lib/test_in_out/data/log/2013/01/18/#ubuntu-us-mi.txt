[02:53] <brousch> I have written a Kivy app for Android. Give this a try https://dl.dropbox.com/u/101667/SayThis-1.0-debug.apk
[02:54] <brousch> you might have to turn up your media volume
[03:08] <snap-l> rick_h_:  I think this ball has a leak.
[03:08] <snap-l> Either that, or I'm a fatass.
[03:29] <Blazeix> is the leak suspiciously kitten-shaped?
[03:56] <snap-l> not that I'm aware of
[03:57] <snap-l> She hasn't gone near it
[03:57] <snap-l> since it's bigger than her, and moves ominously
[03:57] <rick_h_> snap-l: so that was the site, sent through the bookmarklet to r.bmark.us and then using the chrome print to pdf from there
[03:58] <rick_h_> snap-l: a leak? hmm, maybe the move did something. I only had to top if off when I brought it over
[03:58] <rick_h_> oh well
[04:20] <jhansonxi> All you need is an air supply, valve, pressure sensor, microcontroller, and a bit of software for the ball to have automatic assjustments
[05:16] <snap-l> heh
[05:17] <snap-l> rick_h_: It seems to get a little soft when I inflate it
[05:17] <snap-l> so it's not nearly as inflated. Feels like a beach ball
[05:18]  * snap-l went to Microcenter this evening to look at keyboards
[05:19] <snap-l> Theyy had some Cherry switch models (Razer had Blue, and Logitech had a new gaming model that had some Browns
[05:19] <snap-l> Saw a Thermaltake that didn't look nearly like the unholy matrimony of a Tank and a keyboard
[05:20] <snap-l> http://www.thermaltakeusa.com/store/Product.aspx?C=1154&SC=1165&ID=1471
[05:21] <snap-l> Everything else had macro keys, or Blue switches
[05:21] <snap-l> unfortunately, being Microcenter, the line was ridiculous, so I left it there.
[12:54] <snap-l> Good morning
[12:55] <brousch> My app is a big hit with my 5 year old
[12:55] <brousch> He is busy spelling potty words and making the phone say them
[12:58] <snap-l> Hahahahah
[13:32] <_stink_> haha
[13:44] <snap-l> http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2013/01/18/sportz
[13:56] <snap-l> rick_h_: I've been *ordered* to get a new keyboard.
[13:58] <snap-l> Ordered a Leopold Cherry Black Fullsize with the silencer pads (just in case)
[13:59] <snap-l> so, thank you. :)
[14:07] <rick_h_> snap-l: lol
[14:07] <rick_h_> I'd have said get the brown with the pads, but ok
[14:10] <widox> snap-l: silencer pads?
[14:10] <brousch> snap-l: The one he let you borrow was so loud you were banned from using it?
[14:13] <rick_h_> ok, back
[14:15] <widox> snap-l: something like this? http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/cherry-mx-rubber-switch-dampeners.html
[14:17] <snap-l> brousch: I'm still using it, and JoDee has pretty much said "you are getting a keyboard"
[14:17] <snap-l> I think she was miffed that i came home from Microcenter empty-handed
[14:17] <rick_h_> lol
[14:17] <snap-l> (that's a first)
[14:17] <rick_h_> well, when ordered to get a new toy...you must comply
[14:18] <snap-l> widox: No, I got the pads that fit on the bottom
[14:18] <snap-l> I think it'll be quiet enough without them, but not taking any chances.
[14:19] <snap-l> http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide#post_6009482
[14:19] <rick_h_>  :( not tactile
[14:19] <snap-l> rick_h_: I don't tend to be a tactile person anyway.
[14:19] <rick_h_> interesting though, 60g of force vs 45 for browns
[14:20] <snap-l> I've been typing on rubber domes, remember? :)
[14:20] <rick_h_> lol
[14:21] <snap-l> I spent a good 20+ minutes in the game keyboard aisle checking out keyboards and the different switches, and the blacks felt nice.
[14:23] <widox> snap-l: ah ok. well, if they dont' work out I have a pack of those rubber dampeners you can try
[14:23] <widox> I got a mis-shipment of them
[14:23] <snap-l> widox: Ah, cool. Thank you.
[14:23] <widox> instead of keycaps, I got  dampners :-/
[14:23] <widox> yep
[14:23] <snap-l> Heh
[14:25] <snap-l> I don't think there are any keyboards that are widely available that use the Cherrry Clear switches.
[14:25] <rick_h_> I found one but they're never in stock
[14:26] <rick_h_> and now I can't find it doh
[15:48] <snap-l> btw: if anyone wants a corded Apple keyboard, please let me know
[15:48] <snap-l> It's the white model before the aluminium one.
[18:20] <snap-l> I Think Apress is trying for the "why the hell did they publish a book on that" award from Packt: http://www.apress.com/9781430246022
[18:20] <snap-l> s/trying/vying/
[18:21] <brousch> heh
[18:42] <snap-l> http://www.brython.info/index_en.html <- my bathing suit area just got tight.
[18:54]  * brousch hopes it's not a picture of snap-l's bathing suit area
[18:55] <brousch> snap-l: Sounds similar to http://www.skulpt.org/
[18:56] <snap-l> Interesting

[20:07] <snap-l> JoDee's phone arrived.
[20:08] <snap-l> Now to play patient until I can register it
[20:09] <brousch> What'd she get?
[20:17] <snap-l> Galaxy Nexus
[20:18] <snap-l> So she once again has a better phone than I do (relatively speaking)
[20:18] <snap-l> At least she has the Nexus part. I think the hardware is roughly comparable.
[20:18] <snap-l> save for my camera has more MP than hers.
[20:19] <brousch> nice
[20:21] <snap-l> yeah, I'm looking forward to activating it
[20:21] <snap-l> Have to wait, as Ting has a promo where they'll pay your early termination fee if you activate in February
[20:21] <snap-l> so I have the phone, just need to wait an additional two weeks
[20:22] <greg-g> oh right, nice
[20:22] <brousch> Hm, interesting
[20:23] <widox> snap-l: a fine test of willpower!
[20:39] <snap-l> widox: I'm too impatient for willpower.
[20:39] <snap-l> greg-g: It's like they knew I was waffling because of the ETF
[20:39] <brousch> Mail it to rick_h_ and by the time he mails it back it will be time
[20:40] <snap-l> and decided what the heck, let's pay it for everyone in February.
[20:40] <snap-l> brousch: Hell... no...
[20:40] <snap-l> It's in a secret, undisclosed location
[21:43] <rick_h_> bwuhahahaha http://www.flickr.com/photos/7508761@N03/8392505163/in/photostream
[21:48] <brousch> I don't get it
[21:48] <brousch> You got wood?
[21:48] <rick_h_> it's my awesome lumber
[21:49] <rick_h_> yep, came in the mail today
[21:49] <rick_h_> <3 the look of it
[21:59]  * snap-l passes on the obvious wood for wood joke
[22:19] <rick_h_> booo
