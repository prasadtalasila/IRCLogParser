[17:48] <Riddell> why hello gspr 
[17:48] <gspr> :P
[17:49] <Riddell> gspr: what can kubuntu do for you today?
[17:49] <gspr> KDE bug 306186 seems to affect Kubuntu's kde-workspace 4:4.9.4-0ubuntu0.2, and is quite an annoying problem in my opinion. Upstream's patch applies cleanly against 4:4.9.4-0ubuntu0.2 and fixes the problem (at least as far as I can tell for after testing for a few days)
[17:49] <ubottu> KDE bug 306186 in core "Password Dialog stays on top of all windows after unlocking the desktop" [Major,Resolved: fixed] http://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=306186
[17:50] <gspr> Riddell: I'd like to do a little bit for Kubuntu (although the work has been done upstream), but I don't really know how to proceed.
[17:50] <gspr> How do I go about suggesting upstream's patch for inclusion into (k)ubuntu?
[17:50] <gspr> It's a simple patch, and the problem is well-understood (and very annoying)
[17:51] <Riddell> gspr: well you've just done the suggesting :)
[17:51] <Riddell> but the packaging is the next step
[17:51] <Riddell> also checking with upstream
[17:52] <gspr> OK
[17:52] <Riddell> gspr: know anything about packaging?
[17:52] <gspr> Riddell: Yes, I package stuff for my PPA every now and then, but I seldom get to hear criticism - meaning I probably do a lot of things wrong :)
[17:53] <Riddell> gspr: actually first step is to check for bugs in launchpad or report one if it doesn't exist
[17:53] <gspr> Riddell: I've got a patched version of kde-workspace in my PPA, which simply adds the upstream patch to debian/patches and appends its name to debian/patches/series. That builds without warnings (as far as I can see) and solves the problem (as far as three-four days of testing suggests)
[17:54] <Riddell> yeah that's about all that's needed for a technical solution
[17:54] <Riddell> but this is a stable release update so needs some beurocracy
[17:54] <Riddell> so needs a bug in launchpad
[17:55] <gspr> Riddell: Right, that makes sense. Upstream has the bug as relating to "component kwin", while I patched kde-workspace in (k)ubunut's case. So I just report a bug against kde-workspace on launchpad then?
[17:56] <gspr> Riddell: Also, for the bug report, should I describe/summarize the problem and upstream analysis, or is linking sufficient? In this case, the upstream discussion is short and clear.
[17:56] <Riddell> yes, kwin is part of kde-workspace
[17:56] <gspr> ah, right, ok
[17:56] <Riddell> summarise it yes, just a sentence needed
[17:56] <gspr> OK. I'll check if it's already reported, and report it otherwise.
[17:56] <Riddell> and if you can work out how to link the bug to the upstream bug that's bonus points
[17:56] <gspr> hehe ok
[17:58] <gspr> It doesn't seem to be at bugs.launchpad.net yet, so I'll report
[18:06] <gspr> Riddell: Is this OK? https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kde-workspace/+bug/1102540
[18:06] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1102540 in kde-workspace (Ubuntu) "Screen unlock password dialog stays visible and on top forever after unlocking" [Undecided,New]

[18:07] <Riddell> gspr: click Also affects project to link it to upstream
[18:07] <gspr> Riddell: Ah, ok. Thanks the help :-)
[18:13] <gspr> Riddell: I'll also add: Thanks for the work you've put into KDE on ubuntu! I see your name all over the place, so I can only imagine you've done a lot :-)
[18:14] <Riddell> gspr: ah but now you're here you can do a lot too :)
[18:15] <gspr> Riddell: I don't have time to contribute with anything beyond the occasional bug report, sadly. :-/
[18:16] <Riddell> that's plenty enough
[18:16] <Riddell> gspr: so for this update you need a debdiff, get the original package and get the package with patch and changelog added and run debdiff on the .dsc files
[18:16] <Riddell> and attach that to the bug
[18:16] <Riddell> then subscribe ubuntu-sru

[20:56] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: hey
[20:59] <shadeslayer> hi cyphermox
[20:59] <cyphermox> how are you? :)
[21:02] <shadeslayer> I'm good :)
[21:04] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: how do you do?
[21:04] <cyphermox> not bad
[21:05] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: I had a work item to speak to you about the KDE networkmanagement app VPN plugins 
[21:05] <cyphermox> shadeslayer: remember what it might be about? :)
[21:06] <shadeslayer> ah yes :)
[21:07] <shadeslayer> it was that while the VPN plugins are listed, they might/might not be installed
[21:07] <shadeslayer> so when a user clicks on a plugin that is not installs, we launch the package manager and prod the user to install it
[21:07] <shadeslayer> kind of like what we do with gstreamer plugin search
[21:08] <shadeslayer> ( play an avi file -> can't find the gst plugin, search repo and prompt user to install it )
[21:18] <soee> screen block is broken in RC3 ?
[21:19] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: it was also decided that it would be better to have this in nm itself
[21:20] <cyphermox> ah
[21:20] <cyphermox> I'm not sure it's a matter of a list so much though
[21:20] <shadeslayer> matter of a list?
[21:20] <cyphermox> well
[21:21] <cyphermox> ideally you should be able to add a new VPN plugin without having to modify NM code
[21:21] <cyphermox> AFAIK it would go kind of like the gst plugin, the UI should handle it, and just have enough logic to know to search for any package starting with "network-manager-(vpn)" for instance.
[21:22] <shadeslayer> I see, well, the use case we got a couple of months back ( right before UDS ), was that someone was trying to use one of the VPN plugins via the KDE Frontend, but that plugin was not installed
[21:22] <cyphermox> right
[21:22] <shadeslayer> cyphermox: I think I proposed that initially
[21:22] <shadeslayer> but then someone said that it makes more sense to do it in NM itself
[21:23] <cyphermox> I guess I could have said that
[21:23] <cyphermox> it's just that the choice of package manager then makes more sense in the UI I guess
[21:23] <shadeslayer> I don't remember :D
[21:23] <cyphermox> so no point in changing NM just to add a regex or whatever to list the names of packages for NM :D
[21:24] <shadeslayer> iirc it was you who said that you could make a packagekit interface
[21:24] <shadeslayer> s/make a/use the/
[21:24] <kubotu> shadeslayer meant: "iirc it was you who said that you could use the packagekit interface"
[21:24] <cyphermox> by that I mean that you might be using KPackageKit or whatever, where on Gnome it would be something else
[21:24] <cyphermox> yeah
[21:25] <cyphermox> still it would really have to all be done in the UI
[21:25] <cyphermox> I think
[21:25] <cyphermox> but fair enough -- at least now I know that it's as I thought, about how to make it easier to install the VPN plugins
[21:25] <shadeslayer> okay :)
[21:26] <shadeslayer> how about I write an email to the kde nm developer so that we can discuss this?
[21:27] <shadeslayer> will CC you and JontheEchidna ( qapt/muon dev which is what Kubuntu uses by default )
