[22:26] <average_guy> got mutt working now, on to cmus.  Having trouble getting sound, still working at
[22:30] <Unit193> Heh, barely tried that one, I'm still on (re-)alpine.
[22:31] <wrst> average_guy: installed alsa-utils and unmuted channels with alsamixer?
[22:39] <average_guy> I did wrst
[22:41] <wrst> ok i know this is silly but did unmute the channels with the little mm on them
[22:41] <wrst> you can turn them up but they still aren't unmuted
[22:41] <average_guy> hmmm
[22:43] <average_guy> that was totally it wrst
[22:43] <average_guy> working now :)

[22:44] <wrst> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/2959906/unmute.png
[22:44] <average_guy> Appearantly a lot of ppl have.  I read it about 100 times.  I didn't realize you could turn it up and still hve it muted
[22:44] <wrst> I made the screenshots so might as well use them :)
[22:44] <wrst> yep of course on a gui you see mute checked or what not but not with alsamixer
[22:44] <average_guy> I have no graphics on this box
[22:46] <wrst> ahh my links won't help you will they, figured you were logged in via ssh or something
[22:46] <wrst> you are super hardcare
[22:47] <average_guy> I tryin to be
[22:47] <average_guy> trying to see just what I can do with an old 300 MHz box
[22:49] <wrst> pretty well connected it sounds like
[22:50] <average_guy> I am pleasantly suprised.  This has been a rewarding project for me. I have learned a lot about linux.
[22:50] <average_guy> and this machine may be slow but it is completely silent so I don't mind running it arond the clock
[22:51] <cyberanger> average_guy: is it so quiet you can hear a PNG drop
[22:51] <average_guy> nice
[22:52] <average_guy> good one cyberanger
[22:59] <cyberanger> I've worn that one out, but still a classic, even if it's becomming a dead classic
