[14:31]  * slashbel thinks it could be time to have some fun with the tv-b-gone :P
[14:34] <zmoylan> you could cause a riot with an emp generator at a geekcon :-)
[14:35] <slashbel> emp generators are largely the invention of science fiction

[14:36] <slashbel> when thunderstorms fail to fry electronic without a direct hit, how much power would an emp generator require to be effective
