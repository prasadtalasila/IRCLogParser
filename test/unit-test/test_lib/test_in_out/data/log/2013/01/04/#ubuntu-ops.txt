[18:06] <bazhang> mirc just accidentally opened a 2nd client for mcsx3? with a different nick?
[18:07] <Pici> no?
[18:08] <bazhang> * w3s7y (~w3s7y@188.31.4.136.threembb.co.uk)
[18:08] <bazhang> thats what he claimed
[18:08] <Pici> odd that they're doming from completely different addresses
[18:08] <bazhang> both asking the exact same question/responding to me
[18:09] <bazhang> very. but apparently true, apart from the whole 'accidental' part
[19:02] <DJones> They sent me a pm earlier asking a question "Good Morning! Can anybody here helpme with a little prob? thx. I'm trying to use a ZTE MF180 broadband G3  USB dongle on Unbuntu 12.10. I've found on the Web some alleged solutions, but none has worked.
[19:03] <DJones> Pointed them to #u and they said Oh, is this not it...
[19:03] <DJones> That was under the nick mcsx3
