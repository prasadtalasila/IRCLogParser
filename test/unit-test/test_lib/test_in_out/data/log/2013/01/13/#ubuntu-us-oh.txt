[03:32] <skellat> Grumblesmurf...maybe, just maybe I've got this ZNC bouncer thingy set up right...
[04:09] <drkokandy> are you trying to test something?
[04:22] <skellat> drkokandy: Yep.  And I think it actually may work well for me.
[04:22] <drkokandy> sounds good
[04:23] <drkokandy> great when things like that work
[04:24] <skellat> drkokandy: It is one of the few things that is on this end.  I've had a parade of dying hardware for a while now.  At least the bouncer will keep me logged in and gives a playback buffer when I log in.
[04:25] <skellat> drkokandy: From paultag's perspective...I can be logged in all the time now even though I'm not actually logged in
[04:27] <drkokandy> that's cool skellat - I had heard of ZNC but decided to go with Quassel after Cheri703's strong recommendation. Glad you got it working, and I hope it does what you need it to
[04:27] <skellat> drkokandy: Let us hope
[04:28] <skellat> drkokandy: Any thoughts as to the educational IRC session later this month?  Our default topic is going to be "The Joys of BeagleBoard" unless we get better ideas floating around.
[04:28] <Cheri703> I've got nothing.
[04:28] <Cheri703> though!
[04:28] <Cheri703> Job postings! from my company!
[04:29] <Cheri703> Folks who are interested should poke me first so I can "refer"

[04:32] <drkokandy> skellat - I don't know anything about BeagleBoard, so that might be interesting. When I brought it up I didn't mean to sound like it had to be like a directed educational presentation - it could just be like a roundtable on a topic. At the Ubuntu Hour we had in Mansfield we just kind of talked about 12.10, played with Gnomebuntu, and shared some of our favorite applications. It could be something that casual if you think
[04:32] <drkokandy> that would work
[04:34] <skellat> drkokandy: Okay, narrow it down a little...what would you like a roundtable discussion of?
[04:34] <drkokandy> that might be the problem - I didn't necessarily have a topic in mind :-)
[04:35] <paultag> skellat: :))
[04:35] <drkokandy> Raspberry Pis seem cool, but I don't know anything about the Beagleboard, so I'd be happy to learn a little about them from your experience
[04:35] <skellat> Well, perhaps paultag could nominate a topic or he could give us a presentation about the wonderful things he's doing to Python perhaps...
[04:36] <paultag> is this an Ohio meeting?
[04:36] <skellat> Not a business meeting
[04:36] <paultag> Ah, cool.
[04:36] <drkokandy> the online chat before or after the next IRC meeting
[04:36] <paultag> Well, let's see here
[04:36] <paultag> howabout them redsox
[04:36] <skellat> EEEEEEKKKK
[04:37] <skellat> I've got not just the Cleveland Indians but also the Lake County Captains minor league team to my immediate west!
[04:37] <paultag> Nothing beats a game at the Jake
[04:37] <paultag> oh sorry, the prog'
[04:38] <skellat> Jake (noun): slang for toilet bowl
[04:39] <paultag> so, if anyone's wanting to learn about both Git and Bzr, I have a patch request :)
[04:39] <paultag> bzr-git (unmaintainedish) need a fix so that it can handle git signed tags (and it can't ignore them due to hash problems when committing on top of one)
[04:39] <paultag> if someone wants to do that, they'll get paultag brownie points and perhaps a beer if they drink
[04:41] <skellat> Okay
[04:41] <skellat> I was wondering what on earth hython is
[04:41] <paultag> Oh yes, quite! :)
[04:41] <paultag> It's a way to write Python in, well, Lisp :)
[04:41] <paultag> Python only looks like Python out of coincidence
[04:42] <paultag> so, why not write it in an historic language
[04:43] <skellat> An homage to RMS
[04:43] <skellat> drkokandy: Is this the sort of thing you were looking for in terms of roundtable?
[04:44] <drkokandy> I don't know that I'd be that much help on this kind of thing, but that could be cool to learn about too
[04:44] <paultag> I'm giving a talk on this on the 24th
[04:44] <paultag> I'll post slides shortly thereafter
[04:46] <skellat> Okay
[04:46] <skellat> Well
[04:46] <skellat> That gives me some ideas
[04:46] <skellat> UWN #-Next is going to mention that the default topic is Joy of BeagleBoard
[04:46] <paultag> drkokandy: if you're looking for Pythonic projects, I've got a few -- from simple to advanced
[04:47] <drkokandy> I don't know anything about it paultag, but I just signed up for one of those open online classes that's like an intro to Python
[04:47] <paultag> ah
[04:47] <drkokandy> sounds like fun skellat :)
[04:47] <paultag> drkokandy: well, if you want to flex your newfound skillz, I'd be happy to review, provide feedback and make sure your code sees production :)
[04:48] <skellat> I'm trying to sit down and spend time thoroughly reading "Hello! Python"
[04:48] <skellat> As well as "Learning Perl"
[04:49] <drkokandy> I just hope I can keep up with it - thanks for the support
[04:49] <paultag> I'm quite sure you will! :)
[04:50] <skellat> In other news...I gotta get 18 more signatures to get on the ballot to run for township trustee
[04:50] <paultag> \o/
[04:50] <drkokandy> hooray
[04:51] <skellat> I should get a bunch at church tomorrow
[04:51] <skellat> The filing deadline is August so I'm pushing things harder than I have to
[04:52] <skellat> Though, in world where even things like this are actually bloody well wrong, having additional time to work with may help: http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Laws_governing_recall_in_Ohio
[04:52] <paultag> ballotpedia is amazing
[04:52] <paultag> I'm absolutely chuffed to bits you just posted that
[04:53] <skellat> How so?
[04:54] <paultag> their wiki editors are very sharp and keep a very close eye on State Legislatures; no small task, I can tell you.
[04:54] <paultag> I love using them to double-check my data.
[04:55] <skellat> And here's how I explained to them where they went wrong: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1526255/
[04:55] <paultag> Ah, well, I've not seen much wrt recall laws
[04:55] <paultag> I just check Legislative data
[04:56] <skellat> I remember having to do a series back when I was a working newspaper journalist on how a particular township fiscal officer could be removed before his term was up.  Recall elections don't happen here.  You have to go through other routes that can be described as "weird".
[04:56] <paultag> aye
[04:58] <skellat> Wisconsin could have their recall election for Governor Scott Walker.  Ohio would have a court trial for "... who willfully and flagrantly exercises authority or power not authorized by law, refuses or willfully neglects to enforce the law or to perform any official duty imposed upon him by law, or is guilty of gross neglect of duty, gross immorality, drunkenness, misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance..." for Governor Kasich.
[04:58] <paultag> hahaha
[04:59] <paultag> Oh, Ohio.
[05:00] <skellat> We adopted that in our state's 1912 constitution as the mechanism we could proceed with in addition to old fashioned impeachment by the House and trial by the Senate.
[05:00] <paultag> bicameral legislatures on the state level are silly
[05:03] <skellat> Yeah, but only Nebraska has gone unicameral since 1930
[05:03] <paultag> and samoa iirc
[05:03] <paultag> and dc
[05:04] <paultag> (dc council)
[05:04] <paultag> which I relize may not count
[05:04] <skellat> Nope, the Territory has two houses where one is elected popularly and one is made up of chiefs.  DC has city council which functions in lieu of a state legislature in that unique case.
[05:04] <paultag> one of the territories has a unicam
[05:05] <paultag> skellat: anyway, the fed. supreme court ruled that having a statically sized senate violates equal representation, so they are baiscally just differently sized
[05:06] <paultag> iirc
[05:06] <paultag> or house, can't remember which
[05:06] <paultag> but I know it's now silly
[05:06] <paultag> (you need equal population districts for upper and lower)
[05:06] <skellat> In Ohio it is proportional.  Every 1 senate district equals 3 house districts.  33 senate districts, 99 house districts.
[05:07] <paultag> aye
[05:07] <paultag> http://openstates.org/oh/ ‚Üê if you want to see it in action
[05:07] <paultag> (yes, the data's off in the lower chamber)
[05:07] <paultag> I should be fixing it now, but I'm watching it's always sunny
[05:08] <skellat> And if you want to see some of the local madness out my way, the comments on this story are precious: http://starbeacon.com/local/x964870999/Ashtabula-school-cuts-approved
[05:08] <paultag> thanks :)
[05:08] <paultag> Oh jesus
[05:08] <paultag> they *approved* the cuts?
[05:08] <paultag> what the fuck
[05:08] <paultag> will the Cleveland+ area never learn.
[05:08] <paultag> sadly, quite literally
[05:09] <skellat> Well, deficit spending is not allowed for school districts
[05:10] <skellat> Their budget was provided 25% locally with 75% coming from the state and federales
[05:10] <skellat> Unfortunately the state money is going away and the Obama administration has other priorities
[05:11] <skellat> Property values are so low a 6.4 mill levy would only generate $1.5 million within that district
[05:11] <skellat> They cut everything they could to try to end the academic year in the black as the law demands
[05:12] <skellat> Almost everything is cut to the absolute state minimum required
[05:14] <skellat> I can ponder all the Ubuntu evangelizing I want to do locally but there are some far more fundamental layers of Maslow's hierarchy of needs that need to be tended to before such evangelizing could ever be effective here
[05:15] <paultag> aye, quite
[05:18] <skellat> That's part of the township trustee run.  The platform is simple: "Peace and Security".  I would be pushing to build up policing to make criminal activity unattractive locally and to try to help lift spirits in general by pushing to build confidence locally.  What looms locally is an air of defeat and resignation eagerly awaiting oblivion's arrival and frankly that just sucks.  Borrow a little of "broken windows" policing, update gov
[05:21] <skellat> Alas, my netbook is acting weird and I need to shut it down so I bid you all good night.  With luck there may be a special guest for Burning Circle 97 to talk mental health issues especially in light of Saturday's big news story.  Goodnight y'all...
[05:22] <drkokandy> good night
[05:26] <paultag> n8
[17:40] <skellat> Cheri703: Have we had any Ubuntu Hours out in Mansfield?
[18:34] <Cheri703> no, I have been a slacker
