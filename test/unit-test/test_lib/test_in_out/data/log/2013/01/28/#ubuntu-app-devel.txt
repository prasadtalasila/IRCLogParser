[15:39] <dpm> aquarius, oooooh nice, and with animated gif as well!
[15:39] <dpm> wow
[15:40] <aquarius> tools used to make animated gif: kazam, ffmpeg, mplayer, imagemagick. This should be easier ;)
[15:40] <aquarius> although kudos to askubuntu for having answers for this question :)
[15:41] <dpm> nice
[18:59] <stqn> when people buy stuff in the ubuntu software center, the publisher doesn’t get their email address, right?
[19:05] <qwertzui11> right
[19:06] <stqn> thanks… so I’m thinking I have to generate licence keys, so that I can “identify” people who bought my game on the software center
[19:07] <stqn> in case they want to dl a version for another OS from my web site, for example…
[19:13] <qwertzui11> u can use licenses; checkout  it out @ developer.ubuntu.com
[19:15] <stqn> qwertzui11: yes, I’ve already read everything, or almost…
[19:15] <stqn> just wanted to get a confirmation :)
[19:23] <qwertzui11> stqn: what r u developing? :)
[19:23] <stqn> it’s a small board game…
[19:24] <stqn> http://www.rototostudio.com/smartlines?grab=006
[19:26] <qwertzui11> ah cool
[19:27] <qwertzui11> which engines did u use?
[19:27] <stqn> just SDL/OpenGL
[19:27] <stqn> it’s written in C
[19:27] <qwertzui11> ah, interessting, ur first linux/ubuntu app?
[19:28] <stqn> never released anything on the software center, nor anything big
[19:29] <stqn> I wrote that game on my Amiga 1200 a while back, then ported it to windows, OSX, linux
[19:29] <stqn> morphos too
[19:31] <qwertzui11> ah, okay
