[13:13] <teddy-dbear> Morning peoples
[14:53]  * ChinnoDog yawns
[18:17] <ChinnoDog> So.. Ubuntu for Android.... why aren't I using it yet?
[18:18] <pleia2> because it hasn't been released
[18:18] <pleia2> ask lamalex about it
[18:22] <ChinnoDog> I can't blame lamalex because he isn't here.
[18:23] <pleia2> s/blame/ask
[18:23] <ChinnoDog> blaming is more fun though because it is lamalex
[18:23] <pleia2> I don't think he's in charge of product release, but he should know something
[18:23] <ChinnoDog> k.
[18:43]  * waltman is holding out for Xubuntu for Android
[18:43]  * waltman just sighted a MutantTurkey 
[18:56] <ssweeny> you know too much already
[21:37] <jedijf> waltman: did the turkey have a resume for tailfeathers?
[21:43] <waltman> I discretely didn't bring up his resume, seeing as how we were chatting with his boss at a different job at Drexel at the time. :)
[21:51] <jedijf> ahh, very good
[22:22] <IdleOne> jedijf: You still the person to talk to about LoCo stuff getting done?
[22:22] <roasted_> hello!
[22:23] <IdleOne> heya roasted_ I belive you want to talk to jedijf about your project, not sure he is here right now though
[22:23] <IdleOne> believe*
[22:23] <roasted_> sounds good
[22:23] <roasted_> thanks for the insight bro
[22:23] <IdleOne> no problem
[22:23] <roasted_> I gotta switch clients tho - need to work on my server hosting irssi
[23:17] <jedijf> IdleOne: yeah
[23:17] <jedijf> roasted___: wassup?
[23:18] <ChinnoDog> hi jedijf
[23:18] <jedijf> hello ChinnoDog
[23:36] <ChinnoDog> I am trying to fix my desktop computer.. finally. RAID bios hangs after BIOS update. Looks like one particular drive causes it to hang
[23:38] <roasted___> hey there jedijf
[23:39] <ChinnoDog> howdy roasted___. I haven't seen you here before.
[23:39] <roasted___> jedijf: I was just bangin around some ideas when I was in the ubuntu-offtopic chat. I work for a public school district in the IT department. I heard some numbers that suggested a higher number (than I thought) of students have no computer at home. That kind of got the ball rolling for an idea... about repurposing older P4 (and newer) machines that people might otherwise throw out in favor of something like, say, Ubuntu wit
[23:40] <roasted___> need accordingly based on what the principals and guidance counselors think since they would have a better idea of financial situations with certain families.
[23:40] <roasted___> ChinnoDog: haven't been here before. This channel was recommended to me.
[23:40] <roasted___> Then it was brought to my attention that some other people might already be doing this, so here I am. :D
[23:44] <ChinnoDog> roasted___: who recommended?
[23:45] <pleia2> IdleOne, seems like
[23:45] <roasted___> ChinnoDog: come to think of it, I may have gotten two groups mixed up.
[23:45] <roasted___> I think the point of coming here was, hey, I'm an Ubuntu user from Lancaster PA. :D
[23:45] <ChinnoDog> Oh yea? I am from Ephrata.
[23:45] <roasted___> nice, nice
[23:47]  * IdleOne wonders how pleia2 is liking her new employer
[23:47]  * pleia2 happy dance
[23:48] <waltman> pleia2: wow, it's already been a week, hasn't it?
[23:48] <jedijf> that's the week one anywhere dance
[23:48] <pleia2> waltman: yep!
[23:49] <pleia2> flying to Seattle on Sunday to actually meet some of my team for real
[23:49]  * IdleOne dances with pleia2 
[23:49] <pleia2> :)
[23:52] <IdleOne> So, anyway. roasted___ had an idea about helping kids get computers and I sorta remembered ubuntu-pa doing something like that at some point and I also mentioned Partimus to him, who I know are in SF but they might have insight to offer.
[23:52] <IdleOne> Now he just needs to start emailing people and get something going I guess.
[23:53] <waltman> pleia2: How are you adjusting to having coworkers in the same time zone as you?
[23:53] <roasted___> I want to take some initial baby steps because I'm pretty confident I can dig up a ton of gear considering I have several hundred co-workers who are all about helping kids.
[23:53] <pleia2> waltman: my boss has been in europe all week and the team is actually quite scattered, so... not :)
[23:54] <waltman> hah
[23:54] <waltman> but...but...Seattle!
[23:54] <IdleOne> pleia2: Like the old job, but better!
[23:54] <pleia2> yeah, there are a couple people there, so I do have some coworkers in my timezon!
[23:54] <pleia2> +e
[23:54] <pleia2> it's also nice to not have a phone
[23:54] <pleia2> everyone just uses IRC <3
[23:54] <IdleOne> nice
[23:55] <pleia2> roasted___: IdleOne mentioned Partimus.org, we're doing this in San Francisco, so far we've only really been able to get into public charter schools, school districts are terribly bureaucratic and near impossible to get into
[23:56] <pleia2> ubuntu pennsylvania did work with a recycling program, an adult learning center and girlsinc.org
[23:56] <waltman> Yesterday morning I emailed someone who I thought was 2 blocks away about doing a talk next month. He didn't reply until last night. Turned out he had to fly home to China for a funeral, and now he's stuck there until he gets a new visa.
[23:56] <roasted___> pleia2: I hear ya. I work for a school district, so I know what hoops it takes in order to get district-purchased equipment the "ok" to recycle and/or donate.
[23:56] <roasted___> pleia2: this idea though is being driven from personal gear that teachers may own... have laying around in their basement, garage, etc.
[23:57] <roasted___> that makes it exponentially easier since the gear is being donated from individuals, and not necessarily from a district who purchased it with tax payer dollars (which is where it gets hairy)
[23:58] <pleia2> roasted___: the barrier we've run into is district-mandated "standards" for hardware and software that specifically exempt things that aren't approved in triplicate by some committee
[23:58] <roasted___> this is still in its infancy stages yet. I only got the okay to talk to staff at an upcoming meeting a few hours ago.
[23:58] <pleia2> one of our teachers even had to go to bat to protect the linux lab he built for his students from one of the district higher ups, it was pretty sad
[23:59] <roasted___> yeah, that's pretty bad
[23:59] <pleia2> (he had allies so it worked out, but it shouldn't have happened)
