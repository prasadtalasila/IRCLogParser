[11:00] <mgz> bobweaver: bug 915505
[11:00] <ubot5> bug 915505 in launchpad-buildd "0.4 recipes: bzr: ERROR: exceptions.AttributeError: 'cStringIO.StringI' object has no attribute 'split'" [Critical,Triaged] https://launchpad.net/bugs/915505
[11:00] <bobweaver> should I use version 3 ?
[11:01] <mgz> you need to use an older version, and jump up and down so IS upgrade our stuff to the latest versions
[11:01] <czajkowski> mgz: got that RT number handy again ?
[11:01] <czajkowski> I've just seached fo rit but I'm not on it
[11:01] <czajkowski> so finding it hard to see in my RT folder
[11:02] <mgz> czajkowski: 46345
[11:12] <bobweaver> mgz,  I replaces recipe with a 0.3 one and I think that it is going to build. thanks
[11:12] <bobweaver> everyone thanks I should say
[11:13] <mgz> bobweaver: ace
[11:13] <bobweaver> I talked to soon :/
[11:15] <bobweaver> woops :  error: version number does not start with digit
[11:15] <mgz> tyoped the recipe?
[11:15] <bobweaver>  I can not use {debversion} ?
[11:15] <bobweaver> 0.3 sorry
[11:18] <bobweaver> mgz,  you where right syntax error
[11:18] <bobweaver> thanks again lol
[11:19] <bobweaver> do you all know where I can find out info about packaging for armel ?
[11:20] <bobweaver> I know that my code that I wrote on top of Unity 2d will run on armel (Qt/Qml) so I would like to package for armel and also for ppc just like Ubuntu was doing
[11:21] <mgz> czajkowski: ^what's the new deal with getting access to arm builders?
[11:22] <czajkowski> a question is filed on LP
[11:22] <czajkowski> as long as the build takes less than 4 hours
[11:22] <czajkowski> and no more than 10 builds a wweek we enable it

[20:31] <shnatsel> Hi! I'm back with more stupid launchpadlib questions!
[20:31] <shnatsel> I can't seem to find a way to get a branch_merge_proposal object by some identifier, e.g. web link URL
[20:31] <shnatsel> are there such methods at all?
[20:37] <shnatsel> there's some example code in https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad/+question/193343 which lists merge proposals by team, API also allows listing them by branch or package. Is there any way to get a merge proposal object by some unique identifier?
[21:03] <maxb> shnatsel: What sort of id?
[21:04] <maxb> Or rather, id for what?
[21:04] <shnatsel> maxb: for the merge proposal; they're typically identified by branch and a numeric ID
[21:05] <shnatsel> maxb: my short-tem goal is to get the merge proposal object by its web URL
[21:06] <shnatsel> the best thing I've come up so far is parsing the web URL, splitting out the branch name, feeding it to branches.getByUniqueName() and bruteforcing web links in merge request array it returns
[21:07] <maxb> >>> lp.load("/~gz/hydrazine/ask_write_private_access_only_643610/+merge/78739")
[21:07] <maxb> <branch_merge_proposal at https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/~gz/hydrazine/ask_write_private_access_only_643610/+merge/78739>
[21:07] <maxb> works for any API object for which you have a full object URL
[21:08] <shnatsel> https://api.launchpad.net/1.0/~<author.name>/<project.name>/<branch.name>/+merge/<id>
[21:08] <shnatsel> this?
[21:08] <shnatsel> oh, wow
[21:08] <shnatsel> maxb: thanks a lot!
[21:08] <shnatsel> maxb: you keep saving me man :D
=== matsubara is now known as matsubara-afk
[23:09] <shnatsel> I keep getting "At least 2 queries/external actions issued in 0.05 seconds" errors from API :(
[23:09] <shnatsel> Here's the code: http://pastebin.com/66wpnQsj
[23:09] <shnatsel> I've added "sleep (1)" everywhere I could imagine
[23:10] <shnatsel> it still happens
[23:11] <shnatsel> the code shouldn't output anything for this particular combination of input data, but it shouldn't exceed any API usage limits either
=== slank is now known as slank_away
[23:13] <shnatsel> looks like "if recipe.daily_build_archive == daily_ppa:" is the offending line, but I have no idea how to slow it down
[23:23] <shnatsel> I've added a sleep everywhere now but it still happens! http://pastebin.com/Y1AB1gZ7
[23:24] <wgrant> shnatsel: That's not an error message itself, just a part of the error page. What's the actual error message, or the full error page?
[23:25] <shnatsel> 410 page gone
[23:26] <wgrant> And which statement is crashing?
[23:27] <shnatsel> I have no idea, the backtrace has only internal launchpadlib items
[23:27] <wgrant> Hmm?
[23:27] <wgrant> Backtraces don't work like that
[23:27] <wgrant> It'll get back to your code eventually
[23:27] <wgrant> It's probably the current_ppa = recipe.daily_build_archive line
[23:28] <shnatsel> I actually used to have sane code before I insterted sleeps everywhere and sent everything to variables
[23:28] <shnatsel> let me see...
[23:28] <wgrant> Try replacing the current_ppa = and current_ppa_link = bits with 'current_ppa_link = recipe.daily_build_archive_link'
[23:28] <shnatsel> "if recipe.daily_build_archive == daily_ppa:" this seems to be causing it
[23:28] <wgrant> I suspect that 'recipe.daily_build_archive' is failing to load because the user that owns the archive is suspended, so you're not allowed to see them
[23:28] <shnatsel> wgrant: oh, that makes sense
[23:28] <wgrant> So compare the link before you dereference and it should work
[23:29] <wgrant> (lp:launchpad is a pathological case for this, because no recipes can sensibly exist for it, so any that do exist are probably created by spammers or otherwise unclever users, so their accounts are more likely to be suspended)
[23:29] <shnatsel> I obtain the PPA with a launchpad.load(), how do I load just the link?
[23:30] <wgrant> Obtaining daily_ppa that way is fine
[23:30] <wgrant> What's breaking is current_ppa
[23:30] <wgrant> What I'd do is check the link (recipe.daily_build_archive_link) before dereferencing it (recipe.daily_build_archive)
[23:31] <wgrant> In fact you don't actually need to dereference it at all in this case -- you only care that the link matches the archive that you care about.
[23:31] <shnatsel> then I'll need a *link* to the daily PPA too, won't I?
[23:31] <shnatsel> to compare them
[23:31] <wgrant> Oh, yeah
[23:31] <wgrant> But you have that already
[23:31] <wgrant> daily_ppa_link
[23:32] <wgrant> From daily_ppa.self_link
[23:33] <shnatsel> wgrant: it doesn't crash anymore! Thank you so much!
[23:34] <wgrant> shnatsel: Excellent.
