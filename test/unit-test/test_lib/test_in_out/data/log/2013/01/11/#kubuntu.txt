[09:06] <jussi> anyone can recommend a basic alarm software? just something like on a phone or watch, set a time and it beeps/blinks at me...
[09:07] <Tm_T> jussi: "at"
[09:08] <jussi> Tm_T: want to give me a quick rundown how it works?
[09:08] <Tm_T> jussi: sure, http://www.brunolinux.com/02-The_Terminal/The_at_Command.html
[09:26] <hateball> jussi: there's kalarm if you like a gui thing
[09:27] <jussi> hateball: yeah, my apt-cache search revealed that - have you used it?
[09:27] <hateball> jussi: yep
[09:27] <jussi> ok, Ill install it then :D
[09:27] <hateball> jussi: Well, tried it at least. I had to fix my broken nepomuk so that was a good exercise at least :p
[09:28] <hateball> jussi: since it relies on kde-pim working properly
[09:28] <hateball> I don't use anything local for that stuff so I hadnt bothered fixing it before
[09:31] <jussi> hateball: I use kdepim on a daily basis, so it should work :D
[09:33] <hateball> jussi: :)
[09:36] <surfn> i'm having problems formatting a usb flash drive
[09:36] <surfn> can anyone help?
[09:38] <hateball> surfn: Are you using the disk utility in KDE?
[09:38] <sbivol> surfn: how are you trying to format it?
[09:38] <hateball> surfn: And what are the details of the problem?
[09:38] <surfn> ok, so I've got a Sandisk 32gb USB drive
[09:39] <surfn> I'm using partition manager
[09:39] <surfn> when I try to delete the partition, it won't allow it
[09:39] <hateball> surfn: Make sure it's not mounted
[09:39] <surfn> its not mounted.
[09:40] <sbivol> surfn: try to create a new partition table and apply. then create your new partition
[09:40] <surfn> sbivol: it is not possible to click new until you have deleted the old partitiion
[09:41] <surfn> I ran an fsck and got an unusual result...
[09:41] <sbivol> surfn: if it doesn't work, try „sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX count=10240”. replace X with your USB drive's letter
[09:42] <surfn> http://paste.kde.org/643586/
[09:42] <sbivol> surfn: ...then retry in Partition Manager. If it still won't work, I suspect your flash drive is damaged/broken
[09:44] <sbivol> surfn: fsck complains that the filesystem is invalid. you might want to „sudo mkfs.ext2 /dev/sdX1”
[09:44] <surfn> sbivol: I did the dd route
[09:44] <surfn> yeah, got invalid result
[09:46] <sbivol> dd basically zeroed your partition table so that you can start with a clean one. If PartMan still doesn't want to format it, the drive is probably broken
[09:47] <hateball> You can run a check with badblocks as well I suppose
[09:48] <surfn> sbivol: I still can't get it to create a new table... there's errors.
[09:48] <surfn> how can I run a check for bad blocks?
[09:49] <surfn> or check if there's just errors
[09:50] <sbivol> surfn: man badblocks, as hateball suggested
[09:50] <sbivol> „man badblocks”, to be clear :)
[09:50] <hateball> I'd use destructive mode, just to test writes properly... since you dont have any data anyhow
[09:54] <surfn> hateball, how do you use destructive mode?
[09:55] <surfn> nm, -f is the answer
[09:55] <hateball> surfn: Not really, -w is
[09:56] <hateball> Perhaps I should have phrased it differently
[09:56] <surfn> i got it
[09:57] <surfn> restarted badblocks test
[10:06] <surfn> hateball, should this be taking a while or is it that the superblock is fuct?
[10:08] <hateball> surfn: a 32GB flashdrive will probably take a while
[10:08] <hateball> surfn: -v should show progress iirc
[10:09] <surfn> ok, I might head to bed for now, and check in the am...

[16:40] <maco__> hi
[16:40] <maco__> i need help
[16:46] <phoenix_firebrd> need a kde app like cpuz , also any tools for overclocking that you can recommend , i prefer to use a GUI based kde apps would be nice
[16:47] <LucidGuy> Any reason to go with Kubuntu or Ubuntu with kubuntu-desktop
[16:48] <phoenix_firebrd> LucidGuy: default settings that will be more like  the default kde desktop
[16:48] <L3top> If I understand your question, if your intent is to run the kde environment, installing Ubuntu will just add a lot of unused clutter.
[16:48] <L3top> and you would be better off just going kubuntu
[16:48] <shadeslayer> maco__: ssup?
[16:49] <LucidGuy> L3top, just wondering, because I can't find kubuntu mirrors like Ubuntu.
[16:49] <shadeslayer> huh?
[16:49] <L3top> what do you mean?
[16:49] <L3top> the sources are identical
[16:49] <L3top> same stuff from the same place
[16:50] <phoenix_firebrd> LucidGuy: torrent?
[16:50] <shadeslayer> yep, and ISO's should be sync'd by the mirrors
[16:50] <L3top> yeah
[16:50] <LucidGuy> I thought the kubuntu-desktop package was not the same as installing kubuntu..
[16:50] <L3top> its all the same stuff.
[16:50] <shadeslayer> LucidGuy: it's exactly the same :)
[16:50] <shadeslayer> just KDE instead of Unity
[16:50] <L3top> ok... the base os is exactly the same
[16:50] <L3top> +1 shadeslayer
[16:51] <maco__> shadeslayer: i have just iso file and i dont know what to do... i try krusader, but it ask parameters. but i dont understand
[16:51] <L3top> it is just that one comes with Unity, and one comes with KDE pre installed
[16:51] <LucidGuy> Ok let me try this again.  If I install Ubuntu and then install kubuntu desktop .. will it be identical as if I were to go with kubuntu directly. (minus all the crap left over by unity etc)
[16:51] <shadeslayer> !iso | maco__
[16:51] <ubottu> maco__: To mount an ISO disc image, type « sudo mount -o loop <ISO-filename> <mountpoint> » - There is a list of useful cd image conversion tools at http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/CD_Image_Conversion - Always verify the ISO using !MD5 before !burning.
[16:51] <L3top> correct
[16:52] <L3top> LucidGuy: ^
[16:52] <shadeslayer> LucidGuy: yep
[16:52] <phoenix_firebrd> L3top: if you plan to remove the ubuntu stuff, just uninstall the gtk runtime, all the gtk stuff will be pulled with it
[16:52] <phoenix_firebrd> LucidGuy: ^A
[16:52] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: some cruft might be left over though
[16:52] <LucidGuy> Ok .. thanks.  Just thought maybe the kubuntu variant was a little more tailored.  So Canonical is fully responsible for Kubuntu?
[16:52] <shadeslayer> LucidGuy: not anymore
[16:52] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: like?
[16:52] <L3top> not exactly
[16:53] <shadeslayer> phoenix_firebrd: I can't say, but I'm reasonably certain that packages that don't use gtk-runtime would be left
[16:53] <LucidGuy> Yet the apt sources are the exact same servers?  They must be working together then.
[16:53] <L3top> The DE is not maintained by Canonical, but is available through them... the OS is managed by Canonical LucidGuy
[16:53] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: thats true
[16:53] <maco__> shadeslayer: what is mountpoint?
[16:53] <shadeslayer> LucidGuy: Kubuntu is now a community project, which means that Canonical provides infra, but does not pay people to work on Kubuntu
[16:53] <L3top> LucidGuy: DE = Desktop Environment (assumes you know what OS is)
[16:53] <shadeslayer> it's like Edubuntu/Lubuntu now
[16:54] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: chromium is the onlt things that stops me from wiping out the gtk stuff
[16:54] <shadeslayer> :)
[16:54] <shadeslayer> maco__: google that word :)
[16:54] <shadeslayer> maco__: but in Windows terms it's like C:/D:
[16:54] <LucidGuy> Yet Kubuntu is the only buntu with 5 year LTS .
[16:54] <shadeslayer> but that's a bad explanation of what a mount point is
[16:55] <maco__> ok thanl you :)
[16:55] <shadeslayer> LucidGuy: uh, Ubuntu will also have a 5 year LTS
[16:55] <maco__> i will try
[16:55] <shadeslayer> maco__: no problem :)
[16:55] <LucidGuy> Yes .. Unbuntu does of course
[16:55] <shadeslayer> maco__: quick and dirty trick : sudo mount -o loop foo.iso /mnt
[16:55] <maco__> if i failed, i will come back:)
[16:55] <LucidGuy> But Lu and Xu do not.
[16:55] <shadeslayer> LucidGuy: hmm, don't know about those I'm afraid
[16:56] <shadeslayer> yofel: ^ any ideas?
[17:00] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: there is a service to do this , can be downloaded via GHNS
[17:00] <shadeslayer> for what?
[17:00] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: sorry
[17:00] <phoenix_firebrd> shadeslayer: wrong channel
[17:00] <shadeslayer> :)
[17:00] <shadeslayer> np

[18:47] <phunyguy> ermmm... yeah you know what I mean
[18:55] <phunyguy> Yeah, in KDE settings I have "Use Manually Specified Proxy" checked, and for SOCKS I have "localhost:1080" set.  I do have a valid SSH tunnel with port 1080 forwarded to a remote server.  This worked under regular Ubuntu, but not in Kubuntu.

[19:17] <UberDuper> What was the irc channel for kmail?
[19:25] <shadeslayer> UberDuper: #kontact
[19:25] <UberDuper> Thank you, sir.
[19:25] <shadeslayer> phunyguy: hm, odd, maybe ask in #kde ?
[19:26] <shadeslayer> and maybe you need to logut/login ?
[19:32] <UberDuper> shadeslayer: Ever setup kubuntu in a kvm/spice vm?
[19:32] <shadeslayer> nope
[19:33] <shadeslayer> well
[19:33] <shadeslayer> I've run live sessions in KVM
[19:33] <shadeslayer> but that's about it
[19:33] <UberDuper> I just can't get the spice bits working.
[19:33] <shadeslayer> wouldn't know :)
[19:33] <UberDuper> So I ditched it and setup x11rdp
[19:33] <UberDuper> Which I guess is fine.
[19:34] <UberDuper> I just don't want to use virtalbox.
[19:34] <UberDuper> I think this is the furthest I've ever gotten trying to switch from osx to linux.
[19:39] <phunyguy> shadeslayer: I am asking in #kde, and they say it only applies to KIO, and things like KDE IM don't use KIO.  So I set it manually in one of the connections and it still doesn't work.  Even one that uses https proxy doesn't work when rekonq works with https queries just fine.
[19:39] <phunyguy> I don't get it.
[19:39] <shadeslayer> errr
[19:40] <shadeslayer> if it's IM specifically ask in #kde-telepathy
[19:40] <shadeslayer> but they might be right about the IM bits
[19:40] <shadeslayer> since all the im bits are done by telepathy and I'm not sure if telepathy respects KDE Proxy settings
[19:40] <shadeslayer> in which case it's a bug and must be fixed
[19:42] <phunyguy> same with Quassel and KMail
[19:42] <phunyguy> they don't respect proxy either
[19:42] <phunyguy> I can't even find an option to set proxy in Quassel
[19:43] <phunyguy> and about logging out and back in, that shouldn't matter
[19:43] <phunyguy> but I will try
[19:47] <phunyguy> newp.
[19:55] <UberDuper> You're trying to use an http proxy for IM?
[19:56] <phunyguy> no, socks.
[19:57] <UberDuper> ah
[19:57] <phunyguy> for example, in ubuntu, they allow you to set a system-wide proxy for socks, and empathy utilizes that
[19:57] <phunyguy> as does anything else requiring an outbound service connection

[22:56] <wolftune> the deal is: I decided I really like the icon-only task manager, and now I've gone from overly cluttered panel to pretty empty. It would work well to do the Unity thing in the empty space
[22:58] <rork> yeah, I used it for a while to save some window space. I made an auto-hiding panel on top for the menubar.
[22:59] <rork> Now instead I have the no panel desktop :)
[22:59] <wolftune> the no panel desktop?
[23:00] <rork> I removed all my panels, and have 5 virtual desktops with the most used icons instead
[23:01] <rork> Each desktop has a different catagory: Internet, Coding, Gaming, Multimedia, System
