[17:52] <melodie> hello
[17:53] <melodie> I have a question about the Ubiquity installer, is there someone available ? It's about how the background is setup (inside the window)
[17:54] <cjwatson> ubiquity doesn't care about that itself; it's up to the GTK theme or the window manager or whatever.  I'm afraid I have no idea how it works.  You need somebody who knows about the desktop environment / window manager / toolkit / whatever that you're using.
[17:54] <melodie> hi cjwatson
[17:55] <ogra_> hwat do you mean by "inside the window"
[17:55] <melodie> I have setup an Ubuntu Openbox using the same gtk themes are Lubuntu does, and tried different window themes
[17:55] <cjwatson> I can't help you further.
[17:55] <melodie> hi ogra_ I mean inside the ubiquity installer window. I have a pic on the web I show the link
[17:56] <melodie> I just updated firefox, it's coming...
[17:56] <cjwatson> And from what I remember about the picture you showed before it's not something that any installer code is responsible for.
[17:56] <ogra_> the content comes from the $flavour/ubiquity/slideshow packages
[17:56] <ogra_> bah
[17:56] <cjwatson> No, this is something different
[17:56] <melodie> this is what I get : http://meets.free.fr/debian/images/ubiquity-frontend-gtk-look.png
[17:56] <ogra_> $flavour-ubiquity-slideshow
[17:57] <cjwatson> ogra_: no
[17:57] <ogra_> k
[17:57] <cjwatson> this is not about the slideshow
[17:57] <melodie> I had tried to install the lubuntu slideshow, this part was still black
[17:57] <melodie> right cjwatson
[17:58] <cjwatson> but it's also not about any installer code, *unless* people who know about openbox say that ubiquity-dm needs to run some special openbox-specific command to set up an openbox-using session correctly
[17:58] <cjwatson> ubiquity-dm sets up a session using entirely its own code, so it's possible it's missing something
[17:58] <ogra_> the pic simply looks like a theme or theme engine is missing
[17:58] <cjwatson> it's bin/ubiquity-dm in the ubiquity source package - compare that with the openbox session setup
[17:59] <melodie> which part of the openbox session setup ?
[17:59] <cjwatson> I have no idea
[17:59] <melodie> ogra_, I have all the same themes gtk2 gtk3 and engines as Lubuntu does, I a sure because I added some after I compared the filesystem.manifest files
[18:00] <cjwatson> This is the responsibility of people porting ubiquity-dm to a new desktop environment to figure out - i.e. you :)
[18:00] <cjwatson> Before you look at ubiquity-dm, though, check that a normal openbox session started from the same live CD (or whatever) works
[18:00] <melodie> I will try to look into the openbox configuration files
[18:00] <cjwatson> If it does then it's reasonable to conclude that ubiquity-dm is missing something
[18:01] <ogra_> openbox looks fine in the screenshot though
[18:01] <melodie> cjwatson, it does, I have done about 20 isos which I tested at home so far and a few are online for testing
[18:01] <ogra_> you have a proper windowframe and theme
[18:01] <melodie> ogra_, right
[18:01] <ogra_> the content is gtk
[18:01] <melodie> here is how the desktop looks
[18:01] <melodie> http://meets.free.fr/debian/images/BoxBuntu.png
[18:02] <melodie> and here is one with htop: http://meets.free.fr/debian/images/BoxBuntu-ressources.png
[18:02] <cjwatson> We don't run the standard Xsession scripts or anything
[18:02] <cjwatson> htop> not relevant
[18:02] <melodie> it's just a window... the only one online atm
[18:03] <cjwatson> Yeah, it just doesn't tell us anything important for this purpose, so skip it :)
[18:03] <ogra_> you likely need to have some kind of gtkrc (not sure what gtk3 usues nowadays to do such native stuff)
[18:03] <melodie> I have compared ubiquity-dm files from this spin I did with the one from Madbox, also built on Ubuntu, but found no difference
[18:03] <cjwatson> Um
[18:03] <cjwatson> I think you're missing the point
[18:03] <melodie> however I didn't compare his openbox setup files yet
[18:03] <cjwatson> ubiquity-dm reimplements all the xsession (etc.) stuff
[18:04] <cjwatson> if your desktop needs something from that to set up its theme properly, that needs to be reimplemented in ubiquity-dm
[18:04] <melodie> ogra_, there is a .gtkrc-2.0 file in it
[18:04] <cjwatson> So you need to understand your desktop environment startup sequence in detail in order to make sure that ubiquity-dm's setup code is sufficient
[18:04] <melodie> cjwatson, if you were right then Madbox's ubiquity-dm would be different than mine, but it's not
[18:05] <melodie> and Madbox has a normal ubiquity window
[18:05] <cjwatson> Well, that's the only special thing that the installer does for this
[18:05] <melodie> cjwatson, ok I'll compare the Openbox setup from Madbox with mine
[18:05] <cjwatson> But if you're not sure then you should compare all the files from all the ubiquity packages, not just ubiquity-dm
[18:05] <melodie> this is something I have not dug yet, so why not.
[18:06] <melodie> I have a buddy who is keen with python who started to dig the ubiquity files so I hope he can do that
[18:07] <melodie> ok, I'll dig openbox startup files, thanks !
[18:07] <cjwatson> Well, you don't need to dig into them in detail; just get the file lists and diff
[18:08] <melodie> yes, sure
[18:09] <melodie> I need to look if some are in the home user directory and also the ones at /etc/xdg/openbox, and that should be it. I'll check what is in the login manager too
[18:27] <melodie> I have another question, while my vbox machines start and restart : is there somewhere at Ubuntu a doc on how to setup isolinux to tweak the theme for Ubuntu boxes ?
[18:27] <melodie> ie: I have no idea how to produce the init file which contains code for one part of the appearance
[19:07] <infinity> cjwatson: Remind me of the magic required to jam a test kernel into a d-i build?
[19:33] <melodie> I'll bbl
[19:33] <melodie> thanks for all, will try to solve my issue
