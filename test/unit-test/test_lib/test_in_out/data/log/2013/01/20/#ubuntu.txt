[00:00] <kostkon> popsch, both of the commands are 100% safe
[00:00] <popsch> kostkon, yep, autoclean cleaned up a lot
[00:00] <kostkon> nice
[00:01] <GetCodeMonkey> I swear if I hit the power ball jackpot I will pay someone to fix this for me lol
[00:01] <popsch> my congratulations to the whole ubuntu community. I know how hard it is to ensure that dist-upgrades are working. all the services seem to run flawlessly. thanks
[00:02] <ubuntu-tester> Why kernel headers are installed by default? why non-tech user would need them?
[00:02] <kostkon> popsch, happy to hear that. i have had a similar experienced. many dist-upgrades, all successful.
[00:03] <thedark12> I always have the weirdest problems
[00:03] <thedark12> I have been using ubu tu for 5 years and I can never get a problem solved in chat
[00:03] <kostkon> ubuntu-tester, i think the kernel headers are needed for dkms, or whatever is called. it rebuilds certain modules after every kernel update
[00:04] <kostkon> ubuntu-tester, like for example, non-free drivers.
[00:04] <GetCodeMonkey> I feel the same way thedark12
[00:04] <GetCodeMonkey> I will say at least people respond here
[00:04] <GetCodeMonkey> in the Mint Linux chat when I was asking I got silence
[00:05] <thedark12> I get silence
[00:05] <[_-S1L3NC3-_]> You Do
[00:05] <thedark12> That is why I guess my problems are weird
[00:06] <thedark12> The whhile reason I am using 10.4 is because I cant get later versions to work with tv out
[00:06] <bubba99> blkadder  r u still here
[00:06] <thedark12> Nobody could help with that
[00:06] <thedark12> Now I need to manually upgrade qt to use some software
[00:07] <thedark12> Because I cant use the repo stuck with the old version
[00:07] <ubuntu-tester> kostkon: any other examples? if i don't use non-free drivers, would i need headers?
[00:08] <thedark12> Googled and manually did make install but the software doesnt recognize that I have upgraded
[00:08] <GetCodeMonkey> I am guessing you got silence because unless you have someone write a new driver for it your sol
[00:08] <ikonia> ubuntu-tester: if you don't need them remove them
[00:08] <thedark12> I guess
[00:08] <ikonia> ubuntu-tester: if you're not sure, leave them, they will cause no harm and take up a very small ammount of disk space
=== Danausplexippus is now known as Idsi
[00:09] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: i will, but want to be sure
[00:09] <ikonia> ubuntu-tester: sure about what ?
[00:10] <kostkon> ubuntu-tester, jsut keep them, to be on the safe side
[00:10] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: sure nothing in the system would need them
[00:10] <ikonia> ubuntu-tester: why do you want to remove them ? what problem are they causing you ?
[00:10] <ikonia> they take up about 2k of disk space, and if you are in any doubt....which it sounds like you are, why remove them

[00:11] <CT1> Hi all.  I seem to have grub/windows loader on the wrong hdd.  I need my  1TB (media disk) connected to boot.  Yet Win7 and Ubuntu are both on another partitioned disk.  How can I fix this? any how-to on the web would be much appreciated.
[00:11] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: well in the 1st place i learn the system. the minor reason is to save traffic updating them with the kernel
[00:12] <ikonia> ubuntu-tester: the package is about 2k - it's not really a saving
[00:12] <ikonia> and what are you learning about the system by removing them......nothing
[00:13] <thedark12> So how about qt? There is no way to uograde it without upgraing from 10.04?
[00:13] <ikonia> thedark12: not from the ubuntu repos, is there a reason you need an upgrade ?
[00:14] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: funny, i misread it as 2M

[00:16] <kunji> GetCodeMonkey: 12.04 is LTS, you're looking to run 3  monitors, umm, how easy or difficult that is depends on just what your setup is.  I've had hell trying to get 2 graphics cards to output at once (one nvidia and one ATI card), but for instance, my current setup uses an A10 APU and 3 monitors was as simple as just connecting them and using the proprietary ATI driver.
[00:16] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: i have it installed in quantal. no non-free drivers, no dkms
[00:17] <Eagleman> ikonia, its not possible to add " virtual permissions"  to a mounted folder?

[00:19] <kunji> Note_: It's certainly possible, you mean via sudo right?  You just need to add them to the sudoers file.  A quick google for "add user to sudoers file" should turn up exactly how you do it.
[00:19] <bubba99> hi kunji  yes still here. i didnt want to do anymore till i discussed this. when i type a command in now it just gives me another line with the > on it
[00:19] <Note_> kunji, thank you
[00:19] <CT1> How can I see (and change) what disk my os(s) boot from?
[00:19] <bubba99> kunji in other words the leading comment on each line (initramfs) has now disappeared.
[00:20] <Eagleman> ikonia, i want some of my local folders mounted in my www directory ( owncloud ) , what would be a good way to secure those things, so when my owncloud setup is hacked,  the files are still safe
[00:20] <ikonia> Eagleman: use the correct permissions
[00:20] <kunji> bubba99: hmm, what does it show you if you use "ls -la"  ?
[00:21] <dr_willis_> CT1:  the bios settings
[00:21] <kunji> bubba99: Both are lowercase "L" there
[00:21] <Eagleman> correct permissions as in?
[00:21] <ikonia> Eagleman: as in set the permissions for the user you want to use the files
[00:21] <bubba99> kunji i am just preparing the livecd again on usb. this time i am doing it in IE instead of chrome and i also realixed that i was putting the ubuntu download file on the usb with the unetbootin transfer as well. so i put that in a different location on hdd this time and took it from there
[00:21] <GetCodeMonkey> kunji problem is I have two monitors
[00:21] <GetCodeMonkey> I am sorry two video cards
[00:22] <GetCodeMonkey> If I had one video card that supported 3 monitors it would be so easy
[00:22] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: linux-headers-generic is a meta-package linux-headers-<version> are a real headers and thay are 12M compressed
[00:23] <kunji> GetCodeMonkey: Yeah, 2 tends to be difficult, I've never gotten it working, but I always figured it would be easier if the ones I was trying to use were the same make, or used the same driver.
[00:23] <bubba99> kunji   that command just gives a > again
[00:23] <ikonia> ubuntu-tester: so ?
[00:23] <kunji> bubba99: No output?  Hmm, how about pressing ctrl+C does that give you back the other prompt?
[00:23] <GetCodeMonkey> Kunki that may be why it worked for me before I had the same video cards before one died and I replaced it with a cheap one
[00:23] <GetCodeMonkey> I quit gaming so I figrued it would not matter
[00:24] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: just the answer to your "the package is about 2k - it's not really a saving"
[00:24] <bubba99> kunji  ok my usb is ready again now
[00:24] <bubba99> ctrl c  = no change   >
[00:24] <kunji> bubba99: I suppose try the usb again, I think I'm out of ideas T.T
[00:25] <bubba99> kunji  should i just try normal boot first?
[00:25] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: still interested in the reason they are installed
[00:25] <ikonia> ubuntu-tester: sure sure, but I suspect you'd be unwise to remove them as libc-dev and the headers are not installed by default (I'm sure someone running a clean install can verify)
[00:25] <bubba99> kunji  in recovery mode ?
[00:25] <kunji> bubba99: It can't hurt, but we didn't really change anything.
[00:25] <CT1> dr_willis_:  I must press F12 at boot to select my disk that I have all my media on (video/mp3/text) as the boot disk for grub to work properly.  I want to have it boot from the disk my operating systems are installed on instead (as I remove the "media" disk frequently)

[00:27] <dr_willis_> CT1: install grub on the internal drives

[00:28] <floogy> nginx-extras - nginx web server with full set of core modules and extras
[00:29] <floogy> Does that package lack auth_digest module?

[00:29] <kunji> CT1: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Installing  Probably want to look at "Reinstalling GRUB2 from a Working System"  and do it on your internal drive.

[00:35] <ubuntu-tester> ikonia: have traced deps with aptitude: linux-libc-dev -> libc6-dev -> gcc -> ubuntu-desktop. description for the latter: "This package depends on all of the packages in the Ubuntu desktop system. It is also used to help ensure proper upgrades, so it is recommended that it not be removed." so it's a Canonical's desision to include gcc and krenel headers in desktop system by default. even if no dkms is installed (my example). i want to know the reason for

[00:35] <smw> Hi all, I am right now running the 12.10 live cd. I have the installer open. I chose "manual partioning" and the screen that came up only shows two of my hard drives. The third (which I wish to install ubuntu on) isn't there. However, the "device for boot loader installation" does show it. What should I do to try to debug it?
[00:36] <smw> I want to install on sda but it only shows sdb and sdc for partitioning
[00:36] <bubba99> kunji still in grub shell (root sheel i guess)
[00:36] <histo> smw: open a terminal and sudo fdisk -l
[00:36] <histo> smw: please pastebin the output of that command
[00:36] <kunji> bubba99: b13717b1-d190-4e22-ab90-b767-c7b9952d, ok, so it is trying to load the correct uuid, Well, does say fdisk -l work now?
[00:36] <bubba99> kunji  do  i try the bios change to usb and run livecd
[00:36] <jrib> ubuntu-tester: gcc is a "Recommends" of ubuntu-desktop
[00:37] <kunji> bubba99: If it does, then we have the useful shell, otherwise go for running the livecd

[00:38] <kunji> bubba99: Then yeah, back to the livecd I guess.
[00:38] <histo> smw: not sure why the partitioner isn't showing sda.  Your live cd is seeing it from that pastebin.
[00:38] <ph4nt0m> why no sound out there
[00:38] <bubba99> gone shutdown again and try livecd on usb. i changed the files on their now since last try

[00:46] <jrib> smw: if you want to get it installed, and can't find a way to make the live cd you have work, you might try the minimal or server install
[00:47] <mojtaba> Does anybody know how can I use RTL language in bash shell?
[00:47] <smw> jrib: this is actually my first time using the live cd
[00:47] <smw> jrib: I always used the alternative cd... but apparently that is no longer supported...
[00:48] <jrib> smw: that's right, but the minimal and server installer will use the installer you're used to from the alternate cd.  You just have to be sure to install ubuntu-desktop and you should end up with the same end-result as using the live cd
[00:48] <Dr_Willis> alternative cd is gone in 12.10+

[00:56] <bubba99> kunji anyway thanks for trying to help me. you gave me plenty of things to try
[00:56] <bubba99> kunji   i do have 1 last question for you
[00:57] <ubuntu-tester> AndChat330644: latest update of openvpn?
[00:57] <kunji> bubba99: ?
[00:59] <bubba99> kunji   how do i know what system is running under ubuntu. i read that some are windows based and some are linux based. how do i know? when i did boot it before the problem it just went straight to ubuntu logo????
[01:02] <coldpizza72i> how do i find the process that is using dpkg?
[01:02] <lubuntu13> On a Macbook 2,1 with Ubuntu 12.10 I am having problems with the wireless connection whereas with Lubuntu 13.04 (Raring Ringtail) it worked just about fine. Now pinging the router doesn't even always work, and forget pinging google.com, I might get a 700ms response and then 7 Destination Host Unreachable and then 400ms... By the way I have a Win7 right beside, with consistent ~50ms pings to
[01:02] <lubuntu13> google.com with no dropped packets. Any help immensely appreciated.
[01:02] <kunji> bubba99: Ubuntu uses the linux kernel.  It is possible to run it in a virtual environment that might have a different host OS, for instance in VMWare.  Or are you asking about the Wubi installer?  I'm not exactly sure how the Wubi installer works.
[01:03] <lubuntu13> BTW my wireless card is atheros ar5418
[01:05] <bubba99> kunji  its only what i have been reading. the online shop were i got the notebook laptop from told me the OS system is ubunto 12.04LTS . the live cd we are creating from unetbootin says it is windows based. when i ran the middle option which is linux based it did not load the same on the usb? I wonder if i should try this option again????
[01:05] <histo> bubba99: which vender didyou buy the laptop from?
[01:05] <histo> bubba99: I would contact them as there should be support
[01:06] <kunji> bubba99: Oh, that, they're just referring to whether you're creating the livecd on windows or on linux.  You're making it on a windows machine right?  So they are referring to it as a "windows based" install.
[01:07] <kunji> bubba99: Or is this something unetbootin itself asks?
[01:07] <smw> jrib: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1101952
[01:07] <ubottu> Ubuntu bug 1101952 in ubiquity (Ubuntu) "ubiquity does not see hard drive" [Undecided,New]
[01:07] <bubba99> histo  yeah i think they will support. they sent me a link to ubuntoforum post about the problem and that is what i have been trying. i will contact them again on monday when they reopen. they may be able to help over the phone but i expect if push comes to shove the machine will have to go back for them to sort it out
[01:07] <ubuntu-tester> what's the difference between linux-image-generic and linux-image-extra-generic (version omitted)?
[01:08] <kunji> bubba99: Can you link the page to the directions you're using?
[01:08] <bubba99> kunji  unetbbootin has 3 options available for creating the livecd. i dont remember what the third was
[01:09] <kunji> bubba99: Ok, if it's something unetbootin is asking, then you probably want the linux option
[01:09] <jordan__> Can somebody tell me why when installing 12.10 the options to encrypt the installation are greyed out / unavailable ?? tried googling couldnt find anything
[01:09] <jrib> smw: looks good, you can see in the UbiquityPartman.txt there's no mention of sda too
[01:10] <smw> jrib: yeah, saw that
[01:10] <smw> jrib: the reason I am upgrading is that gnome-shell starts using up a ton of cpu for no reason occassionally...
[01:10] <kunji> bubba99: I'm not seeing an option like that: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
[01:11] <jrib> smw: what version are you on now?
[01:11] <smw> jrib: was hoping an install of the newest would fix it
[01:11] <smw> jrib: 12.04
[01:11] <bubba99> kunji  i did try the linux option but it seemed to load differently. thinking about it though, it may have been because i copied over the top of the existing windows copy on the usb. i think i will scrub the usb and start fresh with the linux option
[01:11] <jrib> smw: you know you can just do an in-place upgrade?
[01:11] <smw> jrib: I am not a fan of those... call it paranoia ;-)
[01:12] <smw> jrib: I have other problems too such as the computer not shutting down, but I believe that was caused by the fglrx driver
[01:12] <jrib> smw: I've done one fresh install (by choice) since 4.10 on this machine :)
[01:12] <bubba99> kunji  - yes its the middle blue box of the 3 at the top of the page u just posted
[01:12] <smw> jrib: the computer doesn't shut down, it freezes and I need to do a hard shutoff...
[01:12] <smw> jrib: (again, looks like the fglrx driver which steam wanted me to install is to blame)
[01:12] <SaidKLE> Q: I have a correct C++ program compiling in ubuntu 64 bit with g++ v. 4.7.2, but I am having memory allocation issues. It grabs half of the chunk taken up by one array and sticks it in another. If this possibly caused by Ubuntu?
[01:13] <kunji> bubba99: The Download for link?
[01:13] <Crazy_Spai_> I have a question: I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, My brightness setting for my LCD seems bugged. If it is not at the lowest setting the backlight flickers from high to low and the entire computer halts until you can manage to set it back to 0 or restart.
[01:13] <smw> jrib: I am right now trying to figure out what the hell I want to use. I hate unity and gnome-shell is causing my computer's fan to make noise when I am not at my computer
[01:14] <smw> jrib: xubuntu is looking like an idea
[01:14] <bubba99> kunji  yes on the link u just posted its the middle blue box that says download (for linux)
[01:14] <kunji> bubba99: You download UNetbootin for whatever system you're running UNetbootin on (the system you're using to make the usb).
[01:15] <kunji> bubba99: So, whatever OS you're on right now
[01:15] <bubba99> kunji  ok i see. well that is windows
[01:15] <kunji> bubba99: Ah, ok, so download the windows one, start the executable and you should be at that first screen shot they show.
[01:16] <bubba99> kunji  you mean execute on this laptop im writing on?
[01:16] <smw> jrib: anyways, I am going to try the minimal cd, want me to ping you with the results?
[01:17] <kunji> bubba99: yep
[01:17] <jrib> smw: I'll be in and out, sure
[01:17] <DavisPond> How would one remove the Grub program
[01:17] <smw> jrib: adios
[01:17] <kunji> bubba99: I assume that you've downloaded a .iso file for the version of Ubuntu you're making a livecd of right?  So pick the Diskimage option, leave ISO on that pull down menu, then click the ... and find the .iso in your filesystem
[01:17] <smw> DavisPond: why do you wish to remove grub?
[01:18] <mojtaba> Does anybody know how can I use RTL language in bash shell?
[01:19] <DavisPond> I tried to restore Windows 7, it removed Windows 7 but  did not reinstall it. I'm thinking the Grub is the problem.
[01:20] <smw> DavisPond: ok, be more specific, what did you do? What is the current status of the computer.
[01:20] <bubba99> kunji yes i have the iso version of ubuntu 12.04 and then i unetbootin it using windows option and saved it on the usb
[01:20] <kunji> bubba99: Once you're there, make sure it's writing to your usb drive and not some other drive, because it will erase everything currently on the drive.  Then press ok and it should create the livecd on the usb drive
[01:20] <smw> jrib: damn it, this is why I can't come in here, I get stuck helping :-P
[01:20] <kunji> bubba99: Ok, how you were doing it and not working?  Or were you doing something else before?
[01:21] <DavisPond> I did the F9 thing while booting up. Now the computer will  only come up in Ubuntu. If the windows option is picked it kicks over to Ubuntu.
[01:21] <smw> DavisPond: you had windows 7, you installed ubuntu, then ubuntu did not show up in the boot menu?
[01:21] <kunji> bubba99: Sorry, I mean, is this what was not working before
[01:21] <smw> DavisPond: ok
[01:21] <DavisPond> No Ubuntu was successfully installed.
[01:22] <smw> DavisPond: can you pastebin the output of sudo update-grub2 ?
[01:22] <bubba99> kunji  no thats how i always done it . but originally i was saving the .iso ubunto version file to the usb stick too and i thought that was affecting the data read when i put it in the notebook
[01:22] <DavisPond> No I'm not that good.
[01:23] <smw> DavisPond: open a terminal, type sudo update-grub2[enter] and then copy and paste the output to fpaste.org
[01:23] <bubba99> kunji  and when i tried the unetbootin (for linux) version i copied it over the top of the windows version !!! i didnt think to delete the original first. so maybe that could have affected it
[01:23] <smw> DavisPond: then give me a link to the paste
[01:24] <bubba99> kunji  so to open the usb on this laptop which file do i need to open on the usb folder?
[01:24] <kunji> bubba99: Hmm, ah, I see what you mean.  Actually having that there probably didn't make any difference, I tend to use a usb as both livecd and for moving files around.
[01:24] <smw> DavisPond: also, pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l
[01:25] <kunji> bubba99: ?huh, what do you mean, to boot from the usb?
[01:26] <xxx> How can I stop apache2 and cups from starting on boot?
[01:26] <bubba99> kunji  you said i should try the livecd on this laptop to see if it is loaded correctly. would i just select autorun on the usb stick folder?
[01:27] <ubuntu-tester> xxx with chkconfig for ex.
[01:28] <kunji> bubba99: Oh, no, you would try booting this laptop from the usb and see if you can get to a livecd environment
[01:29] <smw> DavisPond: still here?
[01:29] <xxx> ubuntu-tester, I tried to use the option --set apache2 off - but it did not work..
[01:29] <bubba99> kunji  is that a bad idea??
[01:31] <kunji> bubba99: Nope, not a bad idea at all.  The worst that can happen is that it doesn't boot from the usb, in which case it will just boot your Windows normally.  Otherwise it will load a menu, choose the livecd option instead of the install one.  It will boot Ubuntu and then you just shut it down and take out the drive.  No harm done.
[01:31] <Botanic> I am trying to add a ppa to my system however I am getting an error http://codepad.org/Cbf35Np6
[01:32] <Botanic> system is new install of ubuntu 12.04
[01:32] <kunji> bubba99: Double check that the bios give the usb boot priority over the HD boot of course, otherwise you'll just keep ending up with Windows booting.
[01:33] <SaidKLE> Does ubuntu 64 bit 12.10 have memory allocation bugs in the g++ compiler? I can't get valid c++ code to work on my machine.
[01:33] <ubuntu-tester> xxx: try update-rc.d
[01:33] <bubba99> kunji  just worries me that this is my work laptop. i dont own it. and i dont have admin rights. not sure if it will let me in the bios?
[01:34] <kunji> SaidKLE: I doubt it, pastebin your code and I'll take a quick look, those kinds of errors are usually the coders, as in, like 99.99% of the time.
[01:34] <quimoniz> bubba99 bios is separate form operating system, it starts before any kind of operating system, just try?
[01:35] <kunji> bubba99: If the BIOS is password protected, then you won't be able to change it to boot from usb first, but it's easy to check, you just try it and find out, no harm done if it doesn't work.
[01:35] <histo> SaidKLE: have you searched launchpad
[01:35] <kunji> bubba99: Bothering with password protecting the BIOS is pretty rare in my experience though.
[01:36] <brayan> hola?
[01:36] <kostkon> !es | brayan
[01:36] <ubottu> brayan: En la mayoría de los canales de Ubuntu, se habla sólo en inglés. Si busca ayuda en español entre al canal #ubuntu-es; escriba "/join #ubuntu-es" (sin comillas) y presione intro.
[01:37] <comps_> :/
[01:37] <kunji> histo: That's a good place to check for bugs, but I see people say that so often, and not once has it been a compiler error in my experience, it has actually always turned out to not be valid C++.
[01:37] <comps_> grub wont boot my windows
[01:38] <histo> !grub2 | comps
[01:38] <ubottu> comps: GRUB2 is the default Ubuntu boot manager since 9.10 (Karmic). Lost GRUB after installing Windows? See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestoreGrub - For more information and troubleshooting for GRUB2 please refer to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 - See !grub1 for releases before Karmic (9.10)
[01:38] <comps_> no?
[01:38] <comps_> i lost it by installing ubuntu,
[01:38] <histo> comps_: yes please refer to the second link
[01:38] <histo> comps_: for troubleshooting and information.
[01:38] <comps_> it just cycles grub when i tick my windows 7
[01:39] <g0bl1n> After upgrading to 12.04, can't seem to print to a Samsung laser printer via IPP. Cups is installed and seems to work, but nothing prints. Any hint ?
[01:39] <histo> comps_: did you manually partitoin yoru disk or let the installer do it?
[01:39] <comps_> from windows i skrinked 60gbs then let it do its thing.
[01:40] <comps_> it took the 6gb part, and extended it
[01:40] <comps_> 60*
[01:40] <histo> comps_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2/Troubleshooting
[01:40] <quimoniz> When my ubuntu goes into screen-saver mode, as in, the screen turns black after 10 minutes without input, the CPU is being used 100% by compiz - is it normal that compiz eats my cpu while my pc is supposed to wait for me to return?
[01:40] <kunji> comps: Check out those links, and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2 then let us know if you're still having trouble.  That documentation most likely has the answer unless you wrote over windows by accident, but that should be fine unless gparted complained about something.
[01:41] <qualia> After installing bsd into another partition, now ubuntu doesn't boot as well. (EFI)
[01:41] <comps_> i tried boot-repair, same results
[01:41] <folorn> hmm
[01:42] <comps_> :/
[01:42] <qualia> hey do u have the same problem perhaps ? :)
[01:42] <comps_> efi?
[01:42] <comps_> ring any bells?
[01:43] <qualia> yeah, it's these new ones that ship with the new win8 protection stuff
[01:43] <qualia> giving me a headache
[01:43] <kunji> comps_: boot-repair isn't that great, you should probably reinstall grub, and if that doesn't work then add windows to the menus manually.
[01:43] <comps_> walk me thru? please
[01:44] <kunji> comps_: That documentation does a really good job, I learned everything I know about GRUB2 from it and it alone, but I'll be happy to help if you have more particular questions.
[01:45] <comps_> i am medicated stoned, please:/
[01:45] <kunji> EFI has actually not been an issue for me, if it's not working for you, then shouldn't turning off the boot protection in the BIOS really make it not an issue?
[01:45] <qualia> i think there are new issues with the newest ones
[01:46] <comps_> z77 mpower
[01:46] <histo> !uefi | qualia
[01:46] <ubottu> qualia: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[01:46] <comps_> i have uefi..
[01:46] <qualia> yeah i have the same thing i did my research, i installed GRUB2 on it's own with bsd only
[01:46] <comps_> bsd?
[01:46] <comps_> sorry
[01:47] <quimoniz> oh, the compiz bug is related to fglrx proprietary driver... lucky I got google skillz
[01:47] <qualia> i installed it with ubuntu, knowing that ubuntu has UEFI solution and it works, but they don't dual boot. I added a boot menu on my OWN but it didn't work, i did boot-repair it didn't work
[01:47] <kunji> Turn off the boot protection in the UEFI
[01:47] <comps_> my windows 7 shows in grub, just when i click it, back to grub.
[01:47] <qualia> plus, i still don't understand how can a new os installed in a new partition, destroy the whole thing and not even ubuntu boots up now
[01:49] <comps_> not sure but i think i will need my uuid:/
[01:49] <kunji> Most be some manufacturers really botching things then
[01:49] <comps_> just cant think of why
[01:49] <DavisPond> Well this is not too good. It lets me into Ubuntu, takes my pass word, the mouse works for a few seconds then it locks up. CTRL ALT T does not return a terminal window at that point.
[01:50] <DavisPond> Tried reboot several times to no avail.
[01:50] <kunji> comps_: You can get the uuid for a partition by running blkid /dev/sdax x being the partition number and a being the driver letter, as you see from sudo fdisk -l
[01:50] <histo> DavisPond: can you ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a console?
[01:50] <DavisPond> No joy.
[01:50] <kunji> I'm using a UEFI motherboard right now http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813157339
[01:50] <kunji> Hasn't given me any problems at all
[01:51] <comps_> kunji, so i am going in my uefi to turn off boot protection?
=== ericab_away is now known as ericab
[01:52] <DavisPond> Maybe I have a hardware problem?
[01:52] <kunji> comps_: That's the recommended way to get it booting if it doesn't want to cooperate, of course mine has cooperated nicely, so I don't have personal experience with it's success rate.
=== tjbiddle_ is now known as tjbiddle
[01:52] <comps_> kunji, i will try, hope for best.
[01:52] <histo> DavisPond: did you check the iso you downloaded for errors?  Also have you check the burned cd or usb for errors?
[01:53] <jjgalvez__> I've written a python script that loads an XML file relative to the python script. now I've make a soft link to the bin loader, and when I run the script from the link the path is all wrong. So how do I get the path of the python script, not the link?
[01:53] <smw> jrib, just to let you know, the debian installer found it
[01:53] <histo> !ot | jjgalvez__
[01:53] <ubottu> jjgalvez__: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[01:53] <histo> jjgalvez__: Maybe try a python channel
[01:53] <DavisPond> No. That reminds me I shall try the new boot USB I made
[01:54] <bubba99> kunji  r you here ?
[01:54] <kunji> bubba99: yep
[01:54] <g0bl1n> On cups error log I get a "Unknown directive SystemGroup on line 3 of /etc/cups/cupsd.conf"
[01:54] <qualia> Ok I have an idea, it's possible to install GRUB 2 from the Ubuntu 12.10 LiveUSB terminal right ?
[01:54] <kunji> qualia: yep
[01:54] <bubba99> kunji   ok the problem is defo the usb stick
[01:55] <kunji> qualia: I believe it involves chrooting and then installing like on a working install
[01:55] <qualia> kunji, without installing any OSes though
[01:55] <bubba99> kunji  i changed bios to boot from usb   and tried 3 times - nothing it just goes straight to windows load
[01:55] <ubuntu-tester> Just updated to 3.5.0-22 kernel. intel video driver failed to initialize. found in Xorg.0.log: "open /dev/dri/card0: No such file or directory". how do i trouble shoot this?
[01:55] <kunji> qualia: yeah, you just install GRUB2
[01:55] <qualia> ok i understand
[01:55] <qualia> kunji, thank you, have a lovely day
[01:56] <kunji> bubba99: Hmm, well, I guess that's good and bad, bad that it doesn't work, but it sounds better for the computer.

[01:59] <DavisPond> Using Grub ver 1.99
[01:59] <smw> hi DavisPond
[02:00] <comps_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550765/
[02:00] <smw> DavisPond, did you ever pastebin those things for me?
[02:00] <bubba99> kunji  yeah do you think i should try the linux download version again?
[02:00] <DavisPond> I cannot get the Eee netbook to boot up now.
[02:00] <kunji> bubba99: Not unless you've got another linux machine to try doing it from
[02:00] <smw> DavisPond, nothing boots?
[02:01] <comps_> kunji, are you there? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550765/
[02:01] <DavisPond> Well it boots, goes into Ubuntu when I select it in Grub 1.99 and then lets me log in to my user account. Then it freezes up.
[02:01] <kunji> comps_: yeah, I'm looking at it right now
[02:02] <smw> DavisPond, :-\
[02:02] <bubba99> kunji no i havent. so you sure i need the windows download?
[02:02] <kunji> bubba99: yep
[02:04] <DavisPond> The netbook was booting up before and letting me on.
[02:04] <bubba99> kunji  ok well its getting very late here in uk. im going to give up for tonight. thanks for your help and if and when i sort it I will try and let you know. thanks again
[02:04] <kunji> comps_: What happens when the boot fails, is it a blank black screen, or does it give you an error message, or what?
[02:04] <comps_> nope
[02:04] <kunji> bubba99: No problem, I hope you get it working.
[02:05] <comps_> just flashes to grub again
[02:06] <comps_> no errors, it goes black for a second and back to grub (10 seconds to boot ubuntu etc)
[02:06] <kunji> comps_: oh, hmm, I remember that happening before, I don't remember what the problem was though T.T
[02:06] <comps_> ):
[02:06] <bubba99> kunji  i hope so too. i dont really want to have to send it back for repair but if i have to I will. im sure if the worse comes to worst then they will just wipe it and reinstall. i dont have any files/folders on it yet anyway
[02:07] <comps_> i could repair mbr
[02:07] <comps_> bubba
[02:07] <comps_> just run windows repair
[02:07] <folorn> does anyone know  what the name of  skype would  for linux?
[02:07] <comps_> and ovride boot manager

[02:08] <comps_> one sec
[02:08] <folorn> been trying to find a skype client but can't remeber the name of it.
[02:08] <kunji> comps_: You could try that, bubba99's situation is a bit different than yours though, he never had Windows on there, and is trying to get Ubuntu to boot.
[02:09] <comps_> oh
[02:09] <comps_> ubuntu fail to boot?
[02:10] <comps_> try adding --no ahci?
[02:10] <kunji> comps_: Hmm, I'm curious if maybe you need special firmware?  I just notice the section on line 299 of what you posted that is empty.
[02:10] <comps_> just long time since i play on linux
[02:11] <bubba99> ok guys goodnite

[02:11] <comps_> msi z77 mpower
[02:12] <bubba99> i am learning more about this OS all the time
[02:12] <kunji> comps_: Yeah, I tried looking it up quickly but I didn't see anything relating to it in particular with ubuntu
[02:12] <comps_> is there a clean windows boot entry?
[02:12] <kunji> bubba99: Yep keep at it!
[02:13] <comps_> wait --no ahci work?
[02:13] <kunji> comps_: not sure, I think he was giving up for the night
[02:13] <smw> jrib, I officially hate the minimal cd. Too damn long to download everything!
[02:14] <kunji> Well, I need to go, family is waiting for me, I'll probably be back in the morning.
[02:14] <jrib> smw: but the cd itself was fast :)
[02:14] <comps_> so what can i do?
[02:14] <comps_> am i going be able use grub?
[02:14] <smw> jrib, where do you vote for them creating alternate cds again?
[02:14] <smw> jrib, apparently, they are still useful!

[02:18] <comps_> now i remember bubba
[02:18] <comps_> try acpi=off
[02:18] <smw> jrib, should have installed the bare minimum and then used my ubuntu live cd
[02:18] <smw> jrib, the ubuntu live cd contains all the packages, right?
[02:18] <smw> jrib, or I guess that was only the alternate cd
[02:19] <jrib> smw: you can't use the live cd in that way, right.
[02:19] <smw> jrib, ok, why the hell did they remove the alternate cd.

[02:22] <g073nks> No, only other internet device is my hp touchpad
[02:22] <comps_> just add noacpi

[02:38] <blaizco> Hi there. Does anyone know how to fix wifi problem after updating ubuntu kernel to 3.5.0-22?
[02:38] <g073nks> Any ideas? Im stumped...
[02:38] <ubuntu-tester> g073nks: try Ctrl+Alt+F1 when it freeses
[02:38] <g073nks> Nothing happens
[02:38] <ubuntu-tester> *freezes
[02:39] <usr13> texla: xrandr with no arguments will show you usable screen sizes, pick one and do  xrandr -s 800x600 (where 800x600 is what you think you might want).
[02:39] <g073nks> It only responds to hard reboot
[02:39] <ubuntu-tester> g073nks: then you should extract logs and show us
[02:39] <neil098> any issue on video play on ubuntu 12.04? issues like pixelations?
[02:39] <shortstraw8> ubuntu-tester, for some reason I can not clone my repos due to my ssh key.
[02:40] <blaizco> Anyone can help?
[02:40] <g073nks> I cannot even boot or interact with it...

[02:40] <texla> 1600^^
[02:41] <g073nks> No usr13, its back lit, so screen is working... but it's just black
[02:41] <ubuntu-tester> g073nks: you said you can with wireless locked off
[02:41] <usr13> texla: So it shows that you are at:  1600x1200 now?  Well, I don't know what monitor you have, but you do, so pick another one and try it out.
[02:41] <ronnoc> Hey all. Opened a bug report on BKO about constant K3b crashing and got a response about Ubuntu using an antiquated version of FFMpeg. I would post elsewhere but since the Devs seem to think that this might be the reason for the crash, I'm posting here as well.

[02:49] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: does windows menu entry appears on boot?
[02:49] <comps_> yup
[02:49] <usr13> comps_: So you resized sda1 and shrunk it by 60G ?
[02:49] <sherorox> hello everyone. I just recently updated to 12.04 LTS. I tried to get some compiz effects but failed and some Unity crap is messed up. Can someone help me reset visual effects to stock ubuntu 12.04
[02:49] <comps_> and then ran the ubuntu live, install yea

[02:50] <comps_> just puts me back in grub
[02:50] <usr13> ubuntu-tester: http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550807/

[02:51] <usr13> ubuntu-tester: Yea, I dono either.....
[02:52] <meshuggah> is it safe to upgrate from 10.10 to the latest version of ubuntu?
[02:52] <meshuggah> if it is safe, can someone point me a FAQ about it?
[02:53] <sherorox> to add to my previous post if anyone saw it, the windows move really weird.
[02:53] <comps_> so?

[02:54] <sherorox> hey ubottu tryna help a brotha out?
[02:54] <jakepiano> hi all, i have a question. i was able to successfully install ubuntu alongside win8 but i'm still not able to have an option to boot into it. it just boots straight into windows. i've heard things you can do like easyBCD or something. any ideas?
[02:54] <usr13> comps_: I'd boot to Ubuntu and get it fully updated and restore grub.
[02:55] <comps_> i'm on ubuntu..
[02:55] <comps_> i want want back in windows..
[02:55] <usr13> comps_: sudo grub-install /dev/sda
[02:55] <comps_> its there..
[02:55] <comps_> wont boot.
[02:55] <comps_> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550807/
[02:55] <sherorox> jakepiano: im no expert at anything but I think that if you go into windows and go into your settings, there is a way to setup boot menu with os's
[02:56] <g073nks> Usr13, i really want to go back to Ubuntu... but from what i found... asus laptops don't like Ubuntu
[02:56] <sherorox> jakepiano: plus you can do an advanced reboot
[02:56] <usr13> comps_: Here's some additional info about grub:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
[02:56] <comps_> how the hell can i boot windows if grub wants to play stupid, and just acts like windows is a grub loader..
[02:56] <ubuntu-tester> usr13: any chance you can help with my problem (above)?
[02:56] <usr13> comps_: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
[02:57] <usr13> ubuntu-tester: Let me look.
[02:57] <jakepiano> sherorox do you know what settings those are under?
[02:58] <usr13> ubuntu-tester: How far back?  (time...)
[02:58] <jakepiano> usr13 did you see my question?
[02:58] <comps_> this update goona take for ever on my neighbors wifi, while my business class cant be used, no linux driver for killer 2100...
[02:58] <icebird> misterious kernel what is the  problem out of dayli disadventages
[02:58] <comps_> y
[02:58] <ubuntu-tester> Just updated to 3.5.0-22 kernel. intel video driver failed to initialize. found in Xorg.0.log: "open /dev/dri/card0: No such file or directory". how do i troubleshoot this?
[02:59] <icebird> ;)
[02:59] <usr13> comps_: Get a neighbor with faster internet.
[02:59] <usr13> jakepiano: No, sorry...
[02:59] <KI4RO> lol @ usr13
[02:59] <comps_> i have my own business class
[02:59] <jakepiano> usr13 i have a question. i was able to successfully install ubuntu alongside win8 but i'm still not able to have an option to boot into it. it just boots straight into windows. i've heard things you can do like easyBCD or something. any ideas?
[02:59] <comps_> just my is wired modem:/
[02:59] <mehwork> is there a way to make it so i can see ALL my windows when i do alt+tab? I hate having to Alt+` through a grouping of windows to see them all
[02:59] <comps_> and my nic no linux driver..
[02:59] <sherorox> jakepiano: press the windows key + I
[03:00] <usr13> ubuntu-tester: What is your video card?
[03:00] <jakepiano> sherorox ...and?
[03:00] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: maybe it's true. boot info says you have grub loader on sda1, where win bootloader previously was, i suppose
[03:00] <icebird> why should u install ubuntu near win 8?
[03:01] <sherorox> jakepiano: go to general
[03:01] <usr13> jakepiano: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows?action=show&redirect=RestoreGrub
[03:01] <comps_> sooo?
[03:01] <comps_> how can i fix it...
[03:01] <comps_> i want back in windows:/
[03:01] <Harper-ftw> hey
[03:01] <Dr_willis> mehwork,  for unity compiz has a lot of settings and alternatives for the alt-tab function.  you can even have differnt metnods on super-tab if you wanted
[03:01] <ubuntu-tester> usr13: intel hd graphics (with i5)
[03:01] <ubuntu-tester> usr13: GMA2000 or so
[03:01] <icebird> install ubuntu and forget about win
[03:01] <sherorox> jakepiano: then youll see advanced startup. then click restart now. youll then see an option that says "choose a different operating system". Im not 100% if it will see ubuntu. never tried it.
[03:01] <usr13> jakepiano: You need to write grub boot loader to the primary drive, (probably sda)
[03:02] <Harper-ftw> where would one purchased a laptop preloaded with linux?
[03:02] <comps_> MY KILLER 2100 NO LINUX DRIVER :/
[03:02] <jakepiano> sherorox ok
[03:02] <usr13> ubuntu-tester: ls /etc/X11/xorg.conf   #Any error?
[03:02] <jakepiano> and usr13 will the boot repair do that for me?
[03:02] <usr13> jakepiano: yes
[03:02] <sherorox> jakepaino: come back and tell me ur results
[03:03] <jakepiano> ok awesome thanks guys. i'll be back soon i'm sure

[03:10] <usr13> comps_: Sorry.  But it may be that it's hosed.  May need to re-install Win7.  Dono for sure, but prolly....
[03:10] <stevo_> now lets calm down
[03:10] <mlt-> It looks like in 13.04 external media is mounted under /media/<username>/<label> . How can I return it back to /media/<label> ? Is it about gvfs? GConf or where even to look?

[03:15] <Dr_willis> you may need to use a windows repair disk or tool to reinstall the windows bootloader/repair windows
[03:15] <comps_> not funny

[03:16] <machicola> it seems to be messin with my update process
[03:16] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: from what i see, you somehow installed grub on the windows partition (sda1), overwriting windows loader. you need to repair it, then install grub on linux partition (sda5)
[03:16] <comps_> excuse you..
[03:17] <comps_> Avbused powered

[03:17] <usr13> ubuntu-tester: You could just boot the previous kernel for now.  Right?
[03:18] <comps_> i am here only to get grub to get windows bopoted

[03:41] <dizzy117> can some one help me with getting wow on ubuntu
[03:41] <usr13> jakepiano: What didn't work?
[03:41] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: not grub, you somehow managed to install grub on /dev/sda1 instead of /dev/sda

[03:42] <jakepiano> it failed
[03:42] <usr13> jakepiano:  What error did it give?
[03:43] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: that's not enough. repair windows bootloader as well
[03:43] <usr13> jakepiano: You did:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair && sudo apt-get update  ?
[03:44] <comps_> so run the mbr repair also?

[03:45] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: mbr first then
[03:45] <comps_> how?
[03:45] <comps_> can boot repair do it?
[03:46] <comps_> if i go in advanced?
[03:46] <usr13> jakepiano: What did you put in there for "Restore the MBR of: _____________?   (sda ?)
[03:46] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: now grub is in place but win loader is still missing
[03:46] <comps_> can boot repair fix it?
[03:46] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: you need windows dvd
[03:46] <comps_> if i do the mbr retore?
[03:47] <comps_> hmmmm
[03:47] <comps_> no dvd?
[03:47] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: ubuntu's boot repair doesn't contain any windows stuff
[03:48] <comps_> has mbr options?
[03:48] <jakepiano> i didn't do anything for that. all the program gave me was the recommended repair and it failed.
[03:48] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: if you have another windows machine working (same version) you can take in from there
[03:48] <ubuntu-tester> *it
[03:49] <usr13> jakepiano: You have to tell it what drive to install grub to, (which would be sda )
[03:49] <jakepiano> ok
[03:49] <comps_> no way in ubuntu
[03:49] <comps_> ?
[03:50] <usr13> jakepiano: And then you have to tell it which partition your Ubuntu install is on.  (you have to set both of those options.)
[03:50] <jakepiano> usr13 none of the advanced options were available in the program. i tried to go in and select them but it wouldn't allow me to.
[03:51] <usr13> jakepiano: It shows no options in the drop down menu?
[03:51] <jakepiano> just the one sda option
[03:51] <jakepiano> i couldn't do anything else with it

[03:52] <jakepiano> yes
[03:52] <abdostar> where can I download ubuntu iso with all the updates (till today)
[03:53] <jakepiano> and comps_ this link might help with restoring windows bootloader if that was your problem. http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/ubuntu/reinstall-ubuntu-grub-bootloader-after-windows-wipes-it-out/
[03:53] <usr13> jakepiano: Forget that one.  Use the link I gave you.
[03:53] <jakepiano> i tried already it didnt work
[03:53] <kunji> abdostar: I don't know if there are nightly builds for stable...
[03:53] <usr13> jakepiano: You have to also tell it what partition your Ubuntu install is on.
[03:54] <ubuntu-tester> jakepiano: do you have "create bootinfo summary" option in boot-repair?
[03:54] <jakepiano> yes ubuntu-tester
[03:55] <usr13> jakepiano: Did you install 12.04 or 12.10?
[03:55] <ubuntu-tester> jakepiano: please do it and give us the link

[04:01] <jakepiano_> which one should i do
[04:02] <usr13> jakepiano_: Well, windows boots right?  It's Ubuntu that won't boot. Right?
[04:02] <jakepiano_> haha. right.
[04:02] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: did it offer you a choice of OS to repair (of 1)
[04:02] <usr13> jakepiano_: Choose Ubuntu
=== MartinS is now known as Guest2676
[04:03] <usr13> jakepiano_: Oh yea, as the default option, (the one at top), Yea choose Ubuntu.
[04:03] <jakepiano_> usr13 choose ubuntu? well thats what i already did. and also none of the other options are showing up for me

[04:08] <Sara> want to merge it with my ubuntu drive
[04:09] <usr13> jakepiano_: For "OS to boot by default" choose  sda7 Ubuntu
[04:09] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: sudo fdisk -l | pastebinit
[04:09] <Sara> do i loose my ubuntu data?
[04:09] <comps_> usr13 it looks all good in file check..
[04:09] <usr13> jakepiano_: Restore the MBR of:     sda
[04:09] <usr13> jakepiano_:  Partition booted by the MBR:  sda7 Ubuntu
[04:10] <r0n1n> Sara, no, you are only resizing the partition, not formating it

[04:10] <ricardo_> hi
[04:10] <Sara> I press resize partition but it does not allow me to merge it with the 170 gb unlocated space .
[04:11] <Sara> it just lets me to merge ext4 with my swap space
[04:11] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: there is such possibility, little though. backup your data if you can
[04:11] <neil098> hi, ubuntu noob here, any issues with laggy video playback? i got a samsung n100 netbook over here
[04:11] <Sara> don't need backup not very crucial data just prefer not to loose it
[04:12] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: show your gparted screenshot
[04:12] <comps_> get the link usr13?
[04:12] <r0n1n> Sara, my bad. are you logged in to your pc? then you cannot resize your system partition withou unmounting it first

[04:14] <jakepiano_> usr13 ok so it said the boot was successfully repaired and gave me this link http://paste.ubuntu.com/1550941/
[04:14] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: you can try to repair win boot record manually, with image from my PC, at your own risk(!)
[04:14] <r0n1n> Sara, try right click the partition and see if there is an unmount option available
[04:15] <usr13> jakepiano_: Ok. Looks good to me.
[04:15] <Sara> nope not available its gray
[04:15] <jakepiano_> usr13 k i'll reboot and check back
[04:16] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: it's not mounted
[04:16] <usr13> jakepiano_: Ok
[04:16] <r0n1n> Sara, is the /dev/sda6 you want to resize?
[04:16] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: select /dev/sda4 and try to move it
[04:16] <Sara> yes sd6
[04:17] <ubuntu-tester> comps_: if you want it, PM me
[04:17] <neil098> hi, ubuntu noob here, any issues with laggy video playback? i got a samsung n100 netbook over here

[04:21] <tjb1> Anyone here know how to find the address of a PCI parallel port card?
[04:22] <neil098> im thinking that it has to do with updates i did.
[04:22] <usr13> jakerive1: Did the grub screen come up at all?
[04:22] <usr13> tjb1: lspci
[04:22] <neil098> but what i need is a good isolation so we can figure out whats really going on
[04:23] <tjb1> usr13: I haven't been able to find a address using that, the card shows up and it tells me IO ports at 1000 and 1008
[04:23] <Sara> when i try to resize sd4
[04:23] <Sara> http://www.mediafire.com/view/?ccryftj7ufrxen9
[04:23] <Sara> http://www.mediafire.com/view/?ojdutdyim841dtd
[04:24] <usr13> tjb1: lspci -vvvv
[04:25] <tjb1> Still no address from what I can see
[04:25] <Sara> ubuntu-tester
[04:25] <tjb1> Using cat/proc/ioports on my old computer showed two "parport0" entries and one of them was the card, on this new one I only get one parport0 being the onboard card but nothing showing again
[04:26] <xbskid> Is there a way I can force Ubuntu One on Windows to recheck the files it's supposed to keep synced?
[04:27] <xbskid> Clear its cache directory?
=== kaiser is now known as Guest94685
[04:27] <tjb1> In the cat /proc/ioports I see PCI Bus which has 1000 and 1008 listed under it
[04:27] <tjb1> directly above it is PCI conf1 which shows "0cf8-0cff", would the 0cf8 be the address?
[04:28] <jjason> hello all, im trying to understand the difference between free software and open source..  im not sure what room would be appropriate so i figured id ask here
[04:28] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: gparted has warned you about consequences of this action but not denied it. it has queued move operation (see at the bottom)
[04:29] <Sara> i applied it
[04:29] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: show screenshot after that (press Alt+Prtsc instead of Prtsc)
[04:30] <usr13> jjason: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html
[04:31] <Sara> after what its operating. resizing the partion. it needed to move ubuntu data to left and then extend it from right side
[04:31] <Sara> ubuntu has interesting way of doing all these things
[04:31] <Sara> 4.99 of 90 GB
[04:32] <xbskid> jjason: Also: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software#Naming
[04:32] <usr13> jjason: The two terms pretty much describe the same thing.  free software is software that you are free to do with as you wish, you have access to the code.  open source means the same thing, (the source code is available and open to the public for you to look at and edit if you so desire).
[04:33] <r0n1n> Sara: that's a very long operation
[04:33] <jjason> usr13: yeah
[04:33] <bullitt> Newb question: How do I open up a second terminal? Clicking it again on the bar doesn't do anything.
[04:33] <usr13> jjason: /join ##linux
[04:33] <bullitt> Used to slackware :/
[04:33] <jjason> usr13: but..  open source is
[04:33] <jjason> linux
[04:33] <jjason> ok
[04:33] <minond> oh unity...
[04:33] <usr13> bullitt:  Shift-Ctrl-n
[04:33] <minond> try middle click
[04:33] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: you could do it all then apply one time and wait
[04:34] <jjason> usr13:  im trying to figure out how it works that people sell proprietary plugins to opensource applications
[04:34] <smw_> I just installed 12.10. How do you configure empathy? Are there any settings? I lost the ability to have my contacts grouped
[04:34] <jjason> and how open projects get closed
[04:34] <bullitt> minond: middle-click. thank you.
[04:34] <jjason> like nesus
[04:34] <jjason> and tenable
[04:34] <Sara> 56 min :) it said it may fail to boot after these. what should i do if it did fail?
[04:34] <minond> bullitt: np
[04:34] <Sara> is there anyway to repair it?
[04:35] <usr13> jjason: free software does not necessarily mean that it is free as in you do not pay $$ for it.  You may or may not pay $$ for it.
[04:35] <jjason> or how people are able to sell open source applications without customers just downloading on their own and not paying
[04:35] <jjason> right

[04:36] <jjason> usr13: like..  just buying the software, then immediately undercutting the seller
[04:36] <r0n1n> Sara: if your system failed after resizing, you can use your ubuntu live usb for repair work. there's an article on ubuntu wiki on how to do it
[04:36] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair

[04:36] <bullitt> Why does su not work, but when using sudo command (enter pw) work?
[04:37] <Sara> have worked with boot repair before. not with the live usb for repair
[04:37] <Sara> is it the same usb that i installed ubuntu from?
[04:37] <r0n1n> Sara: yes
[04:37] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: yes

[04:40] <Sara> so these two are the same way of repairing ubuntu. boot repair and live usb repair option?
[04:41] <ubuntu-tester> Sara: there is no separate live usb repair option AFAIK
[04:41] <dr_willis> boot a live cd. and install  the boot-repair tool.  is handy to fix grub.
[04:41] <dr_willis> there are some live cd's that comd with boot-repair
[04:42] <ubuntu-tester> dr_willis: but not the official Ubuntu one, right?
[04:42] <usr13> Sara: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[04:42] <jjason> usr13: thanks
[04:43] <usr13> Sara: Insert your Ubuntu CD, reboot your computer and set it to boot from CD in the BIOS and boot into a live session. You can also use a LiveUSB if you have created one in the past. Install and run Boot-Repair:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
[04:43] <usr13> jjason: NP

[05:29] <Omen_20> Was told by a guy in #ubuntu-steam that the symlink wasn't needed. After you move the whole directory all you have to do is open the client and it will ask to either reinstall or search. From there you can just direct it to the new folder. Worked fine.

[06:03] <DaemonicApathy> neil098: Try it from a LiveUSB, and decide for yourself.
[06:04] <cfhowlett> neil098, 12.04 is LTS.  12.10 is not.
[06:04] <DaemonicApathy> This gives you a chance to test programs and features, but gives a bad estimate for speed.
[06:05] <neil098> Ok lets say i wanted to upgrade to 12.10, i tried it now and what happened was i had an error saying it could not calculate the chages
[06:05] <cfhowlett> neil098, verify your iso or search out what that error means.  doesn't sound good.

[06:10] <DaemonicApathy> _sam_: You can use gparted to make a new swap partition. How much RAM do you have?
[06:10] <_sam_> 1 gb
[06:10] <DaemonicApathy> So I would make your swap 2-3GB.
[06:11] <_sam_> ok
[06:12] <neil098> i tried it
[06:12] <neil098> and says no such file in directory
[06:12] <neil098> any specific commands you suggest to check iso
[06:13] <DaemonicApathy> neil098: md5sum /wherever/your/file/is.iso
[06:13] <dr_willis> i would gyess you spelt the file name wrong neil098
[06:13] <cfhowlett> neil098, this is the check the installation ISO.  What you described could be a scrambled installation effect.  plug in your usb or installation dvd and run the check on the iso you installed with
[06:13] <cfhowlett> neil098, correction, check the iso you downloaded and created the installation media with.
[06:14] <neil098> huh?
[06:14] <neil098> i just a newbie
[06:14] <cfhowlett> neil098, did you download a file to install ubuntu with?
[06:14] <neil098> i just downloaded ubuntu from its website and installed it via usb
[06:15] <cfhowlett> neil098, right.  So you need to verify the file you downloaded.
[06:15] <mvt007geek>  can someone tell me if i did checksum right or wrong? http://paste.debian.net/226654/    ihave an image in Downloads/i checksumed it/ then checked the size of the image that i copied in my sd card// and chexksumed that too//
[06:15] <neil098> how do i do that through terminal
[06:15] <Mary__> as anyone here install nagios?  I would assume i would need to install apache first?
[06:16] <cfhowlett> mvt007geek, does the readout match the listed hashsum?
[06:17] <mvt007geek> cfhowlett: what do you mean exactly?
[06:17] <DaemonicApathy> mvt007geek, do you still have the unextracted gz file?
[06:18] <cfhowlett> mvt007geek, on the download page you should see a list of hashsum.  Using the one for YOUR download, you run md5sum.  The output of md5sum should match your hashsum
[06:18] <cah_mendem> any one try install ubuntu on xenserver?
[06:18] <mvt007geek> DaemonicApathy: i checkedsum the gz file befor and that was ok.

[06:20] <neil098> nope
[06:21] <neil098> dont have a usb now.
[06:21] <cfhowlett> neil098, by any chance did you use the windows/wubi installer?
[06:21] <DaemonicApathy> mvt007geek: afaik the sum completely changes after extraction, so you'd have to compare it to a known-to-be-correct extracted file.
[06:21] <neil098> nope, what i just did is downloaded ubuntu on my usb and followed the prompts
[06:22] <mvt007geek> DaemonicApathy: i checksumed the extracted file.is it wrong?
[06:22] <neil098> now the reason why i am wanting to upgrade is maybe it resolve my video issues and slow login screen
[06:22] <cfhowlett> neil098, saving a downloaded iso to the usb doesnt' make it bootable ...
[06:22] <cfhowlett> neil098, save a downloaded USB to your computer, md5sum, THEN create a bootable media.
[06:23] <neil098> ever since i downloaded the updates for kernels my video playback had latencies and is freezing and login screen is slow
[06:23] <ironman> what games from steam are compatible with linux so far?
[06:23] <neil098> i already did a bootable usb
[06:23] <cfhowlett> neil098, boot a different kernel to compare.
[06:23] <neil098> whoa
[06:23] <SunkSullen> Ive played the laf life series games in Linux with wine
[06:23] <DaemonicApathy> mvt007geek: Not wrong, there just isn't an available value for it to compare to. There will be in 15 minutes.
[06:23] <neil098> and how should i be doing that
[06:23] <SunkSullen> *half life
[06:23] <cfhowlett> neil098, so you made a bootable usb with the usb you saved your iso to?
[06:23] <XtremeWiz> I've set my default browser as chromium, but the links in xChat -- they are opened in Firefox. This is weird.
[06:24] <SunkSullen> including half life 1, half life 2 and all the expansions
[06:24] <cfhowlett> neil098, reboot, hit your interrupt key during power on and boot an older version of linux.
[06:24] <mvt007geek> DaemonicApathy: http://paste.debian.net/226654/  did you see this?
[06:24] <SunkSullen> ironman:  also I was using the actual steam versions not the cracked ones
[06:25] <cfhowlett> ironman, ask/investigate on steam.
[06:25] <neil098> i only have ubuntu12.04
[06:25] <SunkSullen> ironman: I did notice problems though with using UNity and steam games but they might have fixed that by now
[06:25] <cfhowlett> neil098, and more than one kernel, you said.
[06:25] <SunkSullen> ironman: I had best luck with gnome-shell or xfce

[06:39] <magn3ts> Engin, do a server install + build-essentials. Vim to your heart's content. Or use XFCE or whatever DE you want that is lightweight enough for your needs.
[06:39] <cfhowlett> !nounity|Engin, assuming you mean unity ...
[06:39] <ubottu> Engin, assuming you mean unity ...: Ubuntu 11.10 and higher use GNOME 3 with the !unity shell by default.  To use GNOME Shell instead, install the "gnome-shell" package and investigate "gnome-tweak-tool".  For GNOME Fallback mode, which is similar to GNOME 2, install "gnome-panel". Both packages will place entries in the Sessions dropdown. Using Natty? See !classic

[07:00] <Geet> cfhowlett, my laptop is listed and the tested versions are 11.10 and 12.04 amd 64 bit. Does that necessaryily mean I will have problems for other versions?
[07:00] <Abhijit> Geet, not for versions mentioned and onwards.
[07:01] <cfhowlett> Geet, no it does not indicate other versions will fail but it has been tested for the ones you listed.
[07:01] <Abhijit> Geet, if you are using a non-mainstream hardware or software then that depends.

[07:02] <Geet> cfhowlett, and what version would you recommend? 12.04 or 12.10? I am currently using 12.10 but it's not smooth as 11.10 was for me and also giving me heating problems.
[07:02] <debiantoruser> ANYBODY!

[07:03] <cfhowlett> Geet, unless you need the latest/greatest/shiniest stuff, I recommend LTS, i.e. 12.04.  My free opinion and worth every cent it cost you.
[07:03] <debiantoruser> Fresh config files is one of the most actual question for every user, what do you think, Abhijit?
[07:04] <Geet> cfhowlett, I plan to immediately put the gnome shell anyways so I guess I will go for it. Btw if 13.10 or 14.04 looks good.. then will I able to upgrade to thos versions?

[07:24] <FPSDavid> anyone help me? I stupidly set my Ubuntu VM to 8GB, and now it ran out of space. Resized it to 20GB in VMWare Player settings, but can't figure out how to resize it in Ubuntu
[07:24] <FPSDavid> if i open gparted, it wont let me resize, since everything is mounted
[07:26] <thec4ke> you need to boot from an unmounted partition or use a rescue disk (image) if one doesnt exist
[07:26] <BillyZane> hi
[07:26] <FPSDavid> thec4ke, how do I do that if its in VMWare?
[07:26] <savio> hi
[07:26] <BillyZane> is the "apt-get" command something all debian distros share?
[07:26] <TakeItEZ> BillyZane: yes
[07:26] <BillyZane> would it work outside of debian?
[07:26] <thec4ke> FPSDavid: use any livecd with gparted
[07:27] <FPSDavid> i tried to make a new VM and run the liveCD version of ubuntu
[07:27] <savio> BillyZane, redhat use rpm and debain uses dpkg for packaging
[07:27] <thec4ke> you can mount the .iso in vmware as a cd device
[07:27] <TakeItEZ> BillyZane: there was apt4rpm, i don't know if that still exists for rpm-based distro
[07:27] <FPSDavid> but then it doesnt see the other VM's stff?
[07:27] <thec4ke> make it in the VM you want to use it on
[07:27] <BillyZane> very interesting.....
[07:28] <BillyZane> so, ubuntu is a gang
[07:28] <FPSDavid> how do i do that, thec4ke?
[07:28] <savio> BillyZane,yup
[07:28] <FPSDavid> i can mount the ubuntu .iso, but then what
[07:28] <thec4ke> go to bios
[07:28] <thec4ke> when it boots up
[07:28] <thec4ke> you have to press the key for it really quickly
[07:28] <thec4ke> its F12 or del iirc
[07:28] <BillyZane> savio: ty :)
[07:28] <thec4ke> then select the CD
[07:29] <savio> BillyZane, no problem

[07:41] <FPSDavid> okay, thec4ke, i got into the Ubuntu LIVE CD

[07:45] <FPSDavid> whats that do?
[07:46] <thec4ke> tells you if sda is mounted or not
[07:46] <FPSDavid> it didnt say anything
[07:46] <FPSDavid> it lets me shrink the partitions
[07:46] <FPSDavid> but not expand
[07:46] <TakeItEZ> FPSDavid: sudo swapoff -a
[07:47] <FPSDavid> still cant expand
[07:47] <dr_willis> cub:  i would say an nvidia card thats not one of those dual-gpu optmius. and not just came out. ;) one that was high end/mid range like last yeaar. ;)
[07:47] <lasantha> FPSDavid i'm just asking, can't you move the sda5 to left?
[07:47] <thec4ke> can you expand the swap partition (sda2)?
[07:48] <FPSDavid> yes
[07:48] <cub> ah dr_willis awesome
[07:48] <sanelss> does anyone have eclipse uno running in 12.1? I can't for the life of me get it to work :(
[07:48] <thec4ke> you probably need to delete the swap, expand the main partition, then readd the swap
[07:48] <thec4ke> then update /etc/fstab to the new swap partition
[07:49] <FPSDavid> how big does the swap need to be, 4GB?
[07:49] <palasso> Hello I noticed on 12.10 my PC connects to wifi from unity greeter. How is that possible? Isn't the wifi password stored in gnome-keyring which is locked before login? Does it have anything to do with that I entered the password when installing 12.10? Is this a security and privacy issue?
[07:49] <thec4ke> id just keep it at 4
[07:49] <thec4ke> it can be smaller but youre less likely to break something

[07:52] <skp1> hello, i just did a fresh install of ubuntu 12.10, and i want it to recognise my seperate /home partition, how do i do that?
[07:52] <ikonia> skp1: how does it not recognise it ?
[07:52] <thec4ke> yea that should work
[07:53] <skp1> well when i navigate to my homefolder there is nothing inside it and it shows my /home partition as a seperate partition. i wanted to keep all my settings with this new install
[07:53] <FPSDavid> how do i do the update /etc/fstab part, thec4ke?
[07:53] <SwedeMike> skp1: what gets mounted on boot is handled in /etc/fstab
[07:53] <thec4ke> after that you might need to run sudo mkswap on the new swap partition
[07:53] <thec4ke> its probably /dev/sda2
[07:54] <thec4ke> not sure if gparted sets up the swap automatically or not
[07:54] <FPSDavid> i right-clciked and set SwapOn
[07:54] <thec4ke> it probably does
[07:54] <FPSDavid> is that good enough?
[07:54] <thec4ke> type swapon -s
[07:54] <FPSDavid> /dev/sda2
[07:55] <thec4ke> youre all set then
[07:55] <TakeItEZ> FPSDavid: if you recreated swap, you might change the UUID in /etc/fstab
[07:55] <FPSDavid> reboot and good to go?
[07:55] <thec4ke> no
[07:55] <thec4ke> you still need to do fstab

[07:56] <skp1> SwedeMike: thanks
[07:56] <dr_willis> it will be a standasrd entry only with the mountpoint being /home
[07:56] <FPSDavid> okay, did that thec4ke
[07:56] <thec4ke> now edit /mnt/etc/fstab
[07:56] <dr_willis> or you could mount it to some other location, then just link it to /home
[07:57] <thec4ke> in whatever editor you like
[07:57] <FPSDavid> what am i adding/changing?
[07:57] <thec4ke> first copy the the line with "swap" written on it
[07:57] <thec4ke> and put a # in front of it
[07:57] <thec4ke> as a backup
[07:58] <thec4ke> then change the UUID=<numbers> line to /dev/sda2
[07:58] <FPSDavid> not sure i follow
[07:58] <FPSDavid> http://cl.ly/image/3m153S1O0k1g/Image%202013-01-19%20at%2011.58.43%20PM.png

[07:59] <thec4ke> copy that line
[07:59] <thec4ke> and put # in front of it
[08:00] <thec4ke> so its # UUID= etc etc
[08:00] <FPSDavid> yaeh
[08:00] <thec4ke> now in the original line, delete the UUID part and the first none after it
[08:01] <thec4ke> now replace it with: none    /dev/sda2
[08:01] <FPSDavid> what do you mean the original line
[08:01] <thec4ke> ug im sorry
[08:02] <thec4ke> replace is with /dev/sda2 swap
[08:02] <FPSDavid> im super lost lol
[08:02] <thec4ke> the one that you copied and put # in front of
[08:02] <FPSDavid> so leave the one i put a #, make a new line below it?
[08:02] <thec4ke> yes, copied from the one you put # in front of
[08:03] <thec4ke> so there are two copies of the same line
[08:03] <thec4ke> one has # in front of it
[08:03] <thec4ke> thats youre backup
[08:03] <thec4ke> in case something doesnt work
[08:03] <thec4ke> # means "ignore this line:"
[08:03] <TakeItEZ> FPSDavid: just create a new line containing this: "/dev/sda2 none swap sw 0 0"
[08:03] <FPSDavid> yeah, i got that part
[08:03] <FPSDavid> so now i have two lines with uuid=9ewhatever
[08:03] <FPSDavid> one commented out, one not
[08:03] <thec4ke> k now delete the uuid=483274982374
[08:04] <thec4ke> and replace it with /dev/sda2

[08:04] <thec4ke> now save and youre done

[08:13] <tms_> after login again login screen comes. I am able to login through guest. I am using 12.04. Can any one help me in this ?
[08:14] <dr_willis> tms_:  login at the console.  see if that works.   common issue is ownership of the .Xauthority file. you could just rename it. mv .Xauthority  OLD.Xauthority
[08:14] <dr_willis> You can get tyo the console via alt-ctrl-f1 through F6 and  use alt-cgrl-f7 to get back to X.
[08:14] <tms_> dr_willis: ok will try it now
[08:15] <dr_willis> if .Xauthority dosent do it.. theres all these other confiog files you may want to move to some backup directory
[08:15] <dr_willis> also a good test is to makea New user. and see if that user can login
[08:15] <dr_willis> sudo adduser testuser
[08:16] <TakeItEZ> and never forget to "sudo deluser testuser" later
[08:18] <tms_> dr_willis: TakeItEZ ok
[08:18] <dr_willis> I always keep the test user around
[08:18] <dr_willis> not like it really takes up much space

[08:19] <cristian_c> Hi
[08:19] <cristian_c> I've enabled suspend with: dbus-send --print-reply --system --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.UPower.Suspend
[08:19] <dr_willis> how it it any more of a security issue then having other users on the system
[08:19] <tms_> switching to 2nd option
[08:19] <cristian_c> It works but when I try resume, a kernel panic occurs or desktop is unusable
[08:19] <dr_willis> if the test user fails.. that would point to a deeper issue with the system
[08:19] <TakeItEZ> dr_willis: in most cases those "testuseraccount has no real password (12345, secret, mummy), there you go
[08:19] <cristian_c> How can I solve this problem?
[08:20] <cristian_c> Any ideas?
[08:24] <aeon-ltd> cristian_c: find a better way to suspend?
[08:25] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, yes
[08:25] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, I've tried with the session menu
[08:25] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, but it occurs tha same problem
[08:25] <tms_> dr_willis: I was able to make test user
[08:25] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, How can I solve?
[08:26] <dr_willis> tms_:  so can the test user login via the gui login screen is the big question.
[08:26] <tms_> dr_willis: but how do I access my admin account
[08:26] <aeon-ltd>  cristian_c no idea, but if you can find out any output before the panic that could help you diagnose if you are set on using this method of suspension
[08:27] <tms_> dr_willis: yes I was able to login
[08:27] <dr_willis> tms_:  that points to the problem being with your other users setting files.  Depneding on how  hard core you want to get theres numerous config files that may be causing issues.
[08:27] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, The last times I tried, I come back to desktop, but it's unusable
[08:27] <dr_willis> tms_:  you could start by just renameing your .config directory to backup.config   and see if the user then works
[08:28] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, for example, the browser doesn't open
[08:28] <tms_> dr_willis: hmm
[08:28] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, any ideas?
[08:29] <aeon-ltd> cristian_c: can you get to the terminals?
[08:30] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, I think, but I'm not sure :)
[08:30] <benedict> adam7

[08:30] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, and done that, then?
[08:31] <cristian_c> :)
[08:31] <aeon-ltd> cristian_c: google the errors

[08:31] <cristian_c> aeon-ltd, thanls
[08:31] <cristian_c> *thanks
[08:31] <tms_> dr_willis: renameing your .config not working. Do I need to restart ?
[08:31] <aeon-ltd> or post them here
[08:31] <dr_willis> tms_:  shoulsent have to. theres other config files in your home you could move to some Backup directory
[08:32] <atlef> zvacet, try in a terminal: sudo shutdown -P now
[08:32] <tms_> ok
[08:32] <zvacet> atlef: I can tryy that but I wish if I can go back no normal procedure
[08:32] <dr_willis> tms_:  one to try renameing next would be .compiz
[08:33] <zvacet> atlef: brb
[08:33] <tms_> dr_willis: ok
[08:33] <dr_willis> tms_:  then perhaps .gconf  and .gnome2
=== ChallengerX is now known as ggghgd
[08:34] <dr_willis> tms_:  if i ever have the issue i just go hard core and delte them all. ;) but ive done stuff like this so much during beta.. that i can get my settings back to how i like them in about 2 min. ;)
[08:34] <dr_willis> tms_:  by renameing the dirs you can move  them back and not lose any customized settings.

[08:37] <dr_willis> exec is a little pointless also i think

[08:39] <dr_willis> skp1:  so you mount it somewhere else FIRST.. ie:  newhome    then copy the old home to it
[08:39] <dr_willis> lcabreza:  not really. never had to do that.
[08:39] <dr_willis> lcabreza:  you got a broken mouse? ;)
[08:40] <lcabreza> dr_willis:yeah, don't have money yet to buy a new one ...its my 9 year mouse ..
[08:40] <lcabreza> dr_willis::'(
[08:40] <dr_willis> that must be one dirty mouse. ;)

[08:42] <zvacet> atlef: I tried to press enter to get message but no luck
[08:43] <atlef> zvacet, hmm
[08:44] <atlef> zvacet, try to repeat the question and see if anyone else knows
[08:44] <Fudge> anyone use live-build, not sure how to fix packge probs, paste here http://paste.ubuntu.com/1551287/
[08:44] <dr_willis> zvacet:  if you use the nosplash option, and verbose kernel options - it may disable that splash stuff so you see any error messages
[08:46] <skp1> im back, i forgot to mention that my /home partition was encrypted..would that cause problems?
[08:46] <benedict> #ubuntu-offtopic is not logged?
[08:47] <zvacet> dr_willis: what exactly  I have to add and in witch file
[08:48] <Tecan> is there some way to make only the hal realtime ?
[08:48] <Tecan> or how does that work
[08:49] <dr_willis> zvacet:   you could edit the grub menu when yu boot and change 'quiet splash' to be 'noquiet nosplash verbose'   and it Might show some messages  when it hangs.. or its possble you need to edit /etc/default/grub and make the options the default (theres a quiet splash line to change) then rerun update-grub
[08:49] <Tecan> when its a realtime kernel whats special in the kernel to make it faster
[08:49] <XtremeWiz> Hi, how can I find the mac address on Ubuntu?
[08:49] <XtremeWiz> ipconfig, iconfig -a, etc. didn't work
[08:49] <dr_willis> its not really 'faster' tecan but  quicker to respond to  specific kinds of events i belive.
[08:49] <skp1> can someone tell me how to automount an encrypted /home partition as my home?
[08:49] <Tecan> oh
[08:49] <TakeItEZ> Tecan: a realtime kernel doesn't make it faster, it just reacts in a predictible timespan
[08:50] <Tecan> does frequency scaling still work ?
[08:50] <dr_willis> eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr f4:6d:04:9e:90:62

[08:50] <TakeItEZ> dr_willis: right you are
[08:51] <dr_willis> skp1:   Your home is currently encrypted?
[08:51] <XtremeWiz> dr_willis: How do I do that?
[08:51] <dr_willis> XtremeWiz:  its right there in the ifconfig info
[08:51] <\\Mr_C\\> what file contains the info config to change for a wireless ssid and wep pass in linux ubuntu?
[08:51] <dr_willis> $ ifconfig

[08:52] <dr_willis> skp1:  no idea really - theres an existing fstab entry  for your /home/ from befor?
[08:55] <zvacet> dr_willis: brb
[08:56] <TakeItEZ> skp1: isn't the encrypted-home thingy handled by login-procedure? fstab shouldn't have any info on that
[08:59] <skp1> TakeItEZ: i dunno how it is handled. the /home drive is from a previous installation and i want to use it for my new installation

[09:22] <sinan> I have a broadcom 4313 wireless card, running on 12.04. It runs, but the link quality is much lower than another device in the same place, and the connection is worse than when windows is used. Any ideas?

[09:23] <Guest69944> but if i use another pc running windows there is sound
[09:23] <knittl> Guest69944: have a look into sound preferences, maybe you have to set the correct output channel
[09:23] <dr_willis> Guest69944:  i have had to twiddle with the pavucontrol tool to select hdmi audio out on some systems
[09:23] <Guest69944> @willis how do u do it
[09:23] <dr_willis> pavucontrol
[09:23] <dr_willis> run pavucontrol   twiddles with till it worked. ;)
[09:24] <dr_willis> but that was on 12.04,, under 12.10 i think it worked properly for me
[09:24] <Guest69944> u mean on my terminal i should run pavucontrol
[09:24] <Ben64> knittl: it might be a problem with video memory
[09:24] <chuxxsss> I get the sound stopping on HDMI to restart after first boot. Guest69944

[09:46] <TakeItEZ> scyld: if you don't have anacron installed, yes
[09:46] <scyld> I have
[09:46] <scyld> but it is not running

[09:58] <TakeItEZ> scyld: you still do not understand how anacron works

[11:02] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: do you have a 64-bit system?
[11:02] <cub> i might have 2 or 3 chrome browsers running, and when i want to switch between them i have to click the icon which then takes a second to load a "window preview"

[11:04] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: I first added it in the CUPS web admin interface, totally fine, except that the jobs completed without actually printing any real paper
[11:04] <MonkeyDust> cub  guess nobody browses the way you do
[11:05] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: then I found the amazing French tuto and replaced the ia32-libs with the 11.10 version, but still no luck. I'm currently not at my neighbor's, but trying to do research before I go back
[11:05] <ubuntuw1204> Beluga: i faced that similar problem until you get the right driver it will behave that way.. <the printer gets added and every time you print the job complete without print>
[11:05] <lcabreza> anybody has an idea how to assign a specific button for scrolling?
[11:05] <cub> MonkeyDust, that's a ridiculous assertion. It's not just browsers, it can be multiple terminals, or anything else for that matter
[11:06] <histo> cub: What sort of behavior are you seeing exactly?
[11:06] <Beluga> ubuntu1204: thanks.. did you use alien to convert from rpm or did you use that .deb supplied by M. Gruz on launchpad?
[11:06] <MonkeyDust> cub  i guess not many people use multiple instances of the same program
[11:06] <cub> histo, it's just laggy
[11:06] <ubuntuw1204> i used alien
[11:07] <cub> i never had this problem on XP or Ubuntu 10.04
[11:07] <histo> cub: you could try a different desktop environment.  Unity may be a little bloated for your specs.
[11:07] <cub> so i'm almost thinking it's a hardware problem
[11:07] <cub> that's what im thinking
[11:07] <bipul> !apm-emulation.h
[11:08] <MonkeyDust> cub  if that's the case, you should consider using a lighter DE
[11:08] <ubuntuw1204> Beluga: you have to select the drivers manually from the list of models and you have to select the correct model otherwise it will not work
[11:08] <ubuntuw1204> Beluga: did you install the deb using sudo dpkg
[11:09] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: as I can give calibrate command to the printer, doesn't that mean that the driver is correct?
[11:09] <ubuntuw1204> Beluga: and if it installed without error then i am sure that you can print..
[11:10] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: I had no errors.. Used "Add printer" in the CUPS interface and selected the correct model
[11:10] <ubuntuw1204> Beluga: just remove the printer and repeat the process as i have told you.. and it will be fine..
[11:10] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: I also did the procedure described in the French tutorial, which had  ccp://localhost:59787 as the location
[11:10] <Beluga> I mean the peripheral
[11:11] <ubuntuw1204> Beluga: no ... thats ok you will get the correct model i am talking of correct drivers..
[11:11] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: I used the correct ones from Canon's website
[11:11] <cub> yeah i was thinking that histo , i do have those kind of de's installed but was hoping to get this working
[11:12] <cub> i would probably need to upgrade my system :\
[11:12] <ubuntuw1204> Beluga: i know you have the right drivers..
[11:12] <histo> cub: Why not use a DE or software that's more fitted to your hardware rather than upgrading hardware just to run unity.
[11:13] <RELOL> I'm unable to open tar.md5 with file-roller since last update
[11:13] <Beluga> ubuntuw1204: maybe I should sudo dpkg -r the drivers and try the Gruz ones

[11:46] <Hiro`> histo: over on the #ipython channel, they told me to remove that and /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/IPython/
[11:46] <ActionParsnip> Xkernel: no worries,  the web is full of how to guides. Try searching.  If you come up blsnk then ask :)
[11:47] <Wulf> ActionParsnip: I'll try that
[11:47] <ActionParsnip> Monkeydust: its nearly all I use these days
[11:47] <mikodo> I want to copy my /home to backup. Using cp to copy to a partition on an external drive, would this be OK and I assume it would make the backup directory for me in the external drive partition: cp /home/mikodo -r /media/<UUID>/home/mikodo
[11:47] <ActionParsnip> Wulf: but do run:   ubuntu-bug lightdm      and report the issue
[11:48] <Wulf> ActionParsnip: I linked the bug report above
[11:48] <ActionParsnip> Mikodo: could use grsync as an alternative
[11:48] <bekks> mikodo: No. cp -r will not necessarilly preserver all permissions, I recommend using rsync -av
[11:49] <mikodo> bekks, OK, i'll study rsync

[11:57] <Hiro`> histo: either way, my next question is: how do I uninstall it? If I run apt-get remove ipython, how will it know which install to remove?
[11:58] <BlackDex> ActionParsnip: testing ram now
[11:58] <BlackDex> other user crashed also
[11:59] <histo> Hiro`: if you do that it will remove the one in /usr/bin/ipython

[12:03] <esy> Hi, I installed Dropbox, but when I open it it says "Couldn't access Dropbox folder"
[12:03] <esy> Where's the problem?
[12:04] <Ben64> Hiro`: well the 2nd one you installed not with apt-get, so you'll have to undo that somehow
[12:04] <Hiro`> Ben64: how do I go about doing that?
[12:04] <Ben64> depends how you installed it
[12:04] <MonkeyDust> esy  try sudo chown [username]:[username]

[12:06] <Opica> Hi! Quick question, i need to format the system disk, i only have a usb stick availabile and a very slow internet connection. Does anyone know of a utility i can setup on my usb drive that would only format the system disk
[12:06] <esy> Didn't work MonkeyDust :(
[12:06] <Hiro`> Ben64: Unfortuately, I don't remember installing it! I'm not sure why I would need to have a second install or how it ended up on my system.
[12:06] <mikodo> I just read what I typed. Should have been cp -r. Thanks ActionParsnip and bekks I'll look into rsync -av   grsync always threw too many errors for my liking. Good day!
[12:06] <esy> I tried both Ubuntu repositories and Dropbox .deb and the error is the same.
[12:06] <bekks> Opica: How do "formatting the system disk" relate to "slow internet access" and why do you want/need to format something?
[12:06] <esy> "Can't access Dropbox folder"
[12:07] <Opica> bekks: I'm selling my old computer in an hour and i forgot to format the disk. downloading a linux img would take more than an hour :)
[12:07] <esy> I'll try to reinstall it and do it again.
[12:08] <bekks> Opica: There is no faster way rather than downloading an image.
[12:09] <Sgt_Shultz> Opica,  DSlinux
[12:09] <esy> Should I do "sudo apt-get install dropbox" or install its .deb?

[12:21] <TBG> Hi all, I just install Ardour Beta 3.5 on Ubuntu 12.10 after getting a new laptop. Everything seemed to go okay but when I start Ardour and make a new project Ardour tells me that is can't make the project file in that folder. The folder is my home folder by the way and I have checked that I own it, its in my group all of the permission belong to me.
[12:21] <ActionParsnip> Tbg: I suggest you report a bug. The app is beta
[12:21] <Dion> Is anyone on right now? I have a bit of an emergency due to a stupid moment.
[12:22] <ActionParsnip> Dion: many
[12:22] <bekks> Dion: Several hundreds according to "/names".
[12:23] <Dion> I tried to install Ubuntu on a MacBook, and in a moment of stupidity didn't bother to check if something was different, just went with the full install from a CD.
[12:23] <TBG> Yar cool ActionParsnip will do. Strange though I had 3.5 Beta on 12.10 on my last laptop
[12:23] <kostkon> TBG, did you try to create a folder in your home and save it in there?
[12:23] <Dion> When I had to reboot, the screen glitched up and froze, and any reboots wouldn't load Ubuntu, just this "?" symbol.
=== MakOke is now known as JotaK
[12:23] <TBG> kostkon, yep
[12:24] <kostkon> TBG, same error?
[12:24] <Sgt_Shultz> ummm, formatting a mac is not stupid..
[12:24] <TBG> kostkon, yep
[12:24] <kostkon> TBG, hmm
[12:24] <Dion> And to be honest, I'm not sure what to do right now to fix it.
[12:24] <TBG> kostkon, yes indeed
[12:24] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion, can your boot from usb ?
[12:25] <mikodo> bekks,    sudo rsync -av /home/mikodo /media/<UUID>/home/mikodo   will make destination directory?
[12:25] <ActionParsnip> Dion: what would 'fixed' constitute?
[12:25] <Dion> I have a CD, and I can boot from it. Sort of.
[12:25] <bekks> mikodo: No. Create the target before copying.
[12:25] <Dion> Well, being able to actually access Ubuntu from regular boot.
[12:25] <mikodo> bekks, Alright Thanks!
[12:26] <TBG> Ooooh I proberbly need to reboot as I have not been added to the group that ardour is in yet
[12:26] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion, What MACrap is it ?
[12:26] <ActionParsnip> Dion: what video chip do you use?
[12:26] <ActionParsnip> Tbg: just log off and on, same as Windows
[12:27] <Dion> Just a regular MacBook. I believe it's Nvidia? I didn't memorize it and I can't exactly check right now.
[12:27] <ActionParsnip> Dion: add the boot option: nouvea.blacklist=1
[12:28] <Sgt_Shultz> dion, also if ubuntu boots, is install not available when booted ?
[12:29] <Dion> Not sure what you're asking. I installed Ubuntu over the OSX, and when I boot from the CD again, it says it indeed installed the Ubuntu, but when I try to boot normally, it doesn't boot Ubuntu, just pops up a file image with ? on it.
[12:30] <kubanc> is it possible to disable keyring in 12.10?
[12:30] <Dion> Oh, almost forgot to mention- the CD I used was 11.10. Is that vital? Should I have gotten 12.10?
[12:30] <TBG> dang it how it just disappear
[12:30] <TBG> s
[12:31] <ActionParsnip> Kubanc: set a blank keyring password and it won't bother you
[12:31] <ActionParsnip> Tbg: launch it from terminal,  the output may help
[12:31] <TBG> Yeah just doing that
[12:32] <kubanc> ActionParsnip, where can i change password?
[12:32] <ActionParsnip> Kubanc: in dash search for 'password'
[12:32] <Dion> No? Nobody?
[12:32] <TBG> Hay what is the command to run Ardour from the terminal?
[12:32] <kubanc> ActionParsnip, password and keys?
[12:32] <MonkeyDust> TBG  try ardour&
[12:33] <ActionParsnip> Dion: did you try my suggestion?
[12:33] <TBG> Cool thanks
[12:33] <ActionParsnip> Kubanc: yes
[12:33] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion, lastest version is best, but on mac issues, a google search, "osx ubuntu install issues" gave me understanding
[12:33] <ActionParsnip> Tbg: not obvious?
[12:33] <dpurgert> ouch ... a blank keyring ... ?
[12:33] <ActionParsnip> Sgt_shultz: best is subjective
[12:33] <raheel_com88> Hi
[12:34] <Dion> Well, I'm not aware of how to add a boot option, sorry.
[12:34] <ActionParsnip> Dpurgert: just the password,  the keyring will be populated
[12:34] <raheel_com88> Any one can help me with rpl command??
[12:34] <Sgt_Shultz> ActionParsnip, yes true, but it is what i am using
[12:34] <TBG> I have tried, ardour, ardour3, ardour35, 3.5
[12:34] <ActionParsnip> Dion: then asking that would be the next intelligent step, right
[12:35] <ActionParsnip> Tbg: use TAB to complete commands
[12:35] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, too early :) ... still blank passwords are bad news
[12:35] <Dion> I keep getting results talking about failed dualboots and the like, but I'm having a hard time finding something on the topic of actually writing over OSX.
[12:35] <ActionParsnip> Dpurgert: given but it stops it asking
[12:35] <TBG> Tried did't get tab complete
[12:35] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion, can you boot cd live, no hd ?
[12:35] <ActionParsnip> ! Bootoption | dion
[12:35] <ubottu> dion: For a list and explanation on some of the boot options, see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootOptions See also !nomodeset.
[12:36] <Dion> I can use Try Ubuntu from the CD if that counts.
[12:36] <ActionParsnip> Tbg: I suggest you install the ardour stable version,  beta software is not for the lay user
[12:36] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, true -- but assuming the PC is trusted ... jsut set the keepalive for longer (e.g. 4 hours) ... it's still a bandaid to the "annoying" need to input the password
[12:36] <raheel_com88> hello
[12:36] <TBG> And double tabbing ar dose not suggest ardour
[12:37] <ActionParsnip> Dion: add the boot option: nouveau.blacklist=1   and it should help
[12:37] <dpurgert> and it's not as bad as leaving it wide open...
[12:37] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion, that should give you the option to install
[12:37] <ActionParsnip> Dpurgert: if there is only one user then its not quite as bad but its still not great

[12:38] <nep1x> hi. When I do install some package on my system with apt-get, how can I know the files and directories where the files are installed?
[12:39] <TBG> Heck Ardour 3 will probably be out by then
[12:39] <nep1x> thanks
[12:39] <Dion> Alright, trying to access boot options.
[12:39] <kostkon> nep1x, you don't need to know. why are you asking
[12:39] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, definitely ... but still, assuming that keyring is "me" ... still feel better about it when it's not wide open ...
[12:39] <nep1x> just for curiosity

[12:41] <khaos> hi in my ubuntu 12.10 (asus laptop) i can change brightness with fn keys but I dont have notification for this change. Is there any way to fix that?
[12:41] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, fair enough
[12:42] <nep1x> but that a mess!! I am just trying to understand how the software is install in this kind of system
[12:42] <ActionParsnip> Nep1x: common libs are installed once and loaded once in RAM unlike Windows which wastes resources with duplicated files and stuff in RAM
[12:42] <kostkon> nep1x, you only need to care about your home folder
[12:42] <Dion> ActionParsnip- Do I add -- before the boot option as the guide linked claims?
[12:42] <Dion> If I'm reading correctly?
[12:42] <kostkon> nep1x, that's the beauty of it
[12:42] <rekoil> hello
[12:43] <rekoil> i have a dm-crypt on a raid i've just finished growing
[12:43] <rekoil> i now want to make the crypt use the new space
[12:43] <ActionParsnip> Nep1x: how, lubs are put in the libs folder and binaries are in /usr/bin etc. If other apps need the same libs then they uee the ones already installed,  fewer and smaller updates and fewer resources used
[12:43] <rekoil> but i'm scared i'm gonna ruin something
[12:43] <rekoil> anyone have any experience growing crypts?
[12:44] <ActionParsnip> Nep1x: one folder for each app is a massive waste and very wasteful. How is a central store of oibs etc a mess?
[12:44] <rekoil> since the raid was 6tb in size (now 8tb) it is using a gpt partition table
[12:44] <rekoil> do i just delete the partition, create a larger one and off i go?
[12:45] <TBG> I just had to put the whole location in /opt/Ardour-3.0beta5_13072/bin/ardour3
[12:45] <bekks> rekoil: You dont need a GPT label for sizes like that.
[12:45] <Amhndu> Hi all
[12:45] <Dion> By the way, is wi-fi strength dependent on the OS? I actually have two laptops- one Acer, one Mac. The Acer keeps disconnecting a lot on both Windows and Ubuntu but the Mac has a very stable connection.
[12:45] <rekoil> bekks: msdos labels dont support partition sizes larger than 2tb do they?
[12:46] <Dion> So I thought maybe it had something to do with the laptop itself, but while I was using Ubuntu on it, the wi-fi was unstable as well again.
[12:46] <khaos> ActionParsnip, we have talked some days ago about no brightness in a laptop. I fixed the prob with acpi_osi=null. Now it works but there is no notification in Unity about chaning brightness. This is not a critical prob but is there any way to fix that? Unity OSI notifications?
[12:46] <nep1x> i guess that all libraries usually go to /usr/lib and bin to /usr/bin, and there is the first place where, by default, package manager looks when going to install something and need a library
[12:46] <nep1x> no no
[12:47] <bekks> rekoil: When going to have just one big filesystem on that drive, you dont need a partition table at all, technically :)
[12:47] <nep1x> i am not saying that...
[12:47] <rekoil> bekks: but i did, and i can't just remove it now can i?
[12:47] <ActionParsnip> Nep1x: the package database tells the package installer what is installed,  if its already installed then its not downloaded
[12:48] <ActionParsnip> Khaos: what make and model system
[12:48] <bekks> rekoil: No, you cant.
[12:48] <Sgt_Shultz> I lobotomized a macbook pro recently, with live cd install, VLC rules over itunes ..... it should work perfectly, using xubuntu here on acer 5733z & HP Dv6 no issues even fingerprint scanner working on hp
[12:48] <rekoil> bekks: :( so, do you know what i am supposed to do?
[12:48] <khaos> ActionParsnip, asus laptop with nVidia GEFORCE 610M 2GB + nvidia Hybrid (Running Bumblebee)
[12:49] <rekoil> do i delete the partition, create a larger one beginning in the same block and resize the crypt?
[12:49] <dpurgert> Dion, not the OS so much as the quality of the hardware...
[12:49] <ActionParsnip> Nep1x: its al about reducing effort,  data storage and RAM use. If Linux used the Windows model,  you'd have about 20 instances if python running
[12:50] <quick-> .msg nickserv identify aloo1aloo
[12:50] <ActionParsnip> Khaos: oh jeez, I wouldn't hold your breath for that.
[12:50] <Dion> dpurgert, then it would make sense Ubuntu would keep the Macbook's stable connection? I hope so.
[12:50] <ActionParsnip> Quick-: time for a password change
[12:50] <Dion> Alright! Opened boot options. Here I go...
[12:50] <quick-> ActionParsnip: I know :)
[12:50] <kostkon> quick-, and do it quickly :P
[12:50] <khaos> ActionParsnip, Ι didnt understand :( sorry

[12:51] <quick-> kostkon: i am done :)
[12:51] <dpurgert> Dion, yeah in theory -- drivers do affect it a little, but not to the point where it's blatantly obvious

[12:51] <nizor> pls i need help
[12:51] <Dion> dpurgert, thank you.

[12:52] <rekoil> bekks: i have an (previously 6tb) 8tb disk in my system, with a 6tb partition on it, this partition is a crypt

[12:52] <nizor> i need to install vlc on my Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex....totally new beginner....pls
[12:52] <rekoil> i want the crypt to use all 8tb
[12:52] <nizor> fine dpurgert
[12:52] <bekks> rekoil: there are no 6/8tb disks, you have a raid setup :)
[12:52] <TBG> I know why it does't show up in a locate search of a tab complete. the opt directory is not used anymore in Ubuntu so it is not in the system paths
[12:52] <rekoil> yes, but that is really irrelevant to the system :P
[12:52] <khaos> ActionParsnip, yeah I know that. But is there a manual way to enable the notification from Unity Notifications or something that? I saw some forums posts that many ppl have this similar problem without having the bubmblebee driver :)
[12:52] <rekoil> the system sees one disk
[12:52] <rekoil> it's a hardware raid
[12:53] <ActionParsnip> Nixor: intrepid is EOL and has been for ages now
[12:53] <bekks> rekoil: And sorry, I never had any reason for messing around with encrypting filesystems.

[12:53] <quick-> kostkon:  Yup :D
[12:53] <dpurgert> nizor, that's unfortunately EOL  -- so not so sure if it can be helped ...
[12:53] <Dion> Inserted the configuration line nouveau.blacklist=1 Do I hit enter or esc or..?
[12:53] <rekoil> neither do i really, i just love experimenting with things
[12:53] <nizor> yes kostkon
[12:53] <ActionParsnip> Nizor: I suggest a clean install if Precise.  It is LTS and supported til April 2017
[12:54] <nizor> wana start with that
[12:54] <bekks> nizor: 8.10 isnt supported for a very long time now.
[12:54] <quick-> hi , I cannot find my bluetooth device even after hcitool dev command. Please help.
[12:54] <kostkon> nizor, i don't think you will ever manage to install the latest version of vlc on it. a much older version maybe
[12:54] <TBG> And yep as I suspected it is a Jack related issue
[12:54] <Dion> Alright, booting...
[12:55] <Dion> Finally!
[12:55] <Dion> Is it permanent, or can I only do this using the disk and the boot option?
[12:56] <TBG> Will look at it more later, thank for the help all
[12:56] <dpurgert> Dion -- you need to have changed the boot option on grub for the PC ... in theory that's what the guys had you do already, so it should be permanent...
[12:56] <ActionParsnip> Dion: no, get updated and install the nvidia-current package,  you'll be ok thereafter
[12:57] <Dion> I'll try if the connection finally stabilizes.
[12:57] <quick-> how can i remove the system proxy fot apt-get .I am using 12.04  LTS and i have removed it from the network connections and also from the /etc/apt/apt.conf but still it says connecting to proxy but i am not using the proxy now
[12:57] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion,complete, update,  a reboot would answer that
[12:57] <Dion> Will Update Manager help?
[12:58] <Dion> Damnation, the wi-fi just won't connect! It was perfect while it was OSX, it should be hardware-based... Da fuck?
[12:58] <Dion> Pardon my language.
[12:59] <dpurgert> Dion, no -- you have to get the nVidia binary (should show up as some option ... I forget which though (intel gfx that "just work(tm)" here)
[13:00] <dpurgert> Dion -- check that the driver is installed/working, and that you've actually told the OS to connect to your wifi
[13:01] <Dion> It registers the network and all, I've entered the password, but it keeps struggling to connect and repeatedly asks to connect again.
[13:02] <Dion> At last! It connects! Stay connected...
[13:02] <Dion> Found the driver options, installing newest NVIDIA drivers.
[13:03] <ActionParsnip> Dion: the wifi is always hardware based, it needs a n antenna.  How do you get software based WiFi?
[13:03] <Dion> That's 173, right?
[13:03] <Sgt_Shultz> I dont wonder why anymore why when i walk past a macshop, why there 30 red shirts & a 100 idiots asking silly questions, UPDATE DRIVERS
[13:03] <bekks> Dion: We dont know which version you are seeing there.
[13:04] <Dion> Version 173 is latest, correct? It's what it's offering.
[13:04] <sogeking99> Hey guys, I am having problems with screen tearing on Ubuntu 12.04. This is very noticeable on videos. I have tried VLC, Totem and gplayer. XBCM seems to not have the issue, but I would rather not have to use that player
[13:04] <bekks> Dion: No, it isnt.
[13:04] <rekoil> bekks: so ignore the encrypted filesystem, how do i grow a partition without regard to filesystem at all on a gpt label?
[13:04] <dpurgert> Sgt_Shultz, because the redshirts are "geniuses" or some such.  on the upside, we can all live with the hope that they'll be the first to go
[13:04] <Dion> Annnnnd it disconnected.
[13:04] <rekoil> because from what i'm reading the crypt will take care of itself
[13:04] <ActionParsnip> Sgt_shultz: people don't mind paying that bit more to know what they have will work
[13:05] <rekoil> i just need to enlarge the space available to the crypt
[13:05] <bekks> rekoil: It will not expand itself.
[13:05] <Dion> Well, we're using a router.
[13:05] <phoenixsampras> Halp!! what is something like photoshop??
[13:05] <ActionParsnip> Dion: get fully updated, I recommend a wired connection
[13:05] <rekoil> the crypt will once i've decrypted it and told it to resize, it will use the block devices total capacity
[13:05] <kostkon> phoenixsampras, gimp
[13:05] <Dion> Well, I only see options for 173 or (version current).
[13:05] <rekoil> i just need to expand that
[13:05] <phoenixsampras> but gimp sucks, must be something more pro?
[13:05] <ActionParsnip> Dion: you still didn't answer about 'hardware wifi' being a thing
[13:06] <bekks> rekoil: Then just use gparted
[13:06] <rekoil> but parted keeps complaining it doesn't detect a filesystem

[13:06] <Note> Hello, does anybody know what sasl2-bin package is?
[13:06] <ActionParsnip> Dion: install the nvidia-current package and it will be fine
[13:06] <Sgt_Shultz> ActionParsnip, yes they told me that for the lisa & classic, still waiting
[13:06] <Note> I am trying to install Cyrus and it tells me to get the package sasl2-bin - however, upon doing apt-get install sasl2-bin - it says Unable to locate package sas12-bin
[13:06] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, hardware is (was) OK under the original OS.  Sounds like it might be the driver acting up...
[13:06] <Note> Does anyone know where i can get this or what it does
[13:06] <rekoil> all i want to do is manipulate the partition map, change partition 1s mapping from 64mb-6000gb, to 64mb-8000gb
[13:07] <Dion> Alright. And someone here said that wi-fi is based on the hardware, not the OS.
[13:07] <llutz> Note: sasl2-bin     two-bin not sastwelve
[13:07] <ActionParsnip> Dion: they don't knoe what they are talking about. Probably a mac user
[13:07] <rekoil> Error: Could not detect file system.
[13:07] <Note> llutz, huh?
[13:07] <rekoil> that's what parted says
[13:08] <ActionParsnip> Dion: every WiFi is hardware based but you still need a driver to tell the OS how to use it

[13:08] <khaos> ActionParsnip, yeah I know that. But is there a manual way to enable the notification from Unity Notifications or something that? I saw some forums posts that many ppl have this similar problem without having the bubmblebee driver :)
[13:08] <rekoil> ah
[13:08] <Dion> Moved it closer to the router, it reconnected. Downloading version current driver now. Hopefully it stays up long enough...
[13:08] <ActionParsnip> Sgt_Shultz: what is 'lisa & classic' please
[13:08] <rekoil> apparently gdisk can do what i want
[13:09] <Note> llutz, so why can't i install it?
[13:09] <Note> it unable to locate packaghe
[13:09] <ActionParsnip> Khaos: do you have libnotify-bin installed?

[13:09] <sogeking99> Hey guys, I am having problems with screen tearing on Ubuntu 12.04. This is very noticeable on videos. I have tried VLC, Totem and gplayer. XBCM seems to not have the issue, but I would rather not have to use that player
[13:09] <khaos> ActionParsnip, yes the sound notifications also works like a charm. only in screen brightness there is no notification
[13:10] <ActionParsnip> Dion: a wired connection will help. Fully updating will help lots
[13:10] <Dion> You know what's ironic? I'm on the Acer right now, which is usually misbehaving with the wi-fi, but it's surprisingly stable right now. Of course, I probably jinxed it just now...
[13:10] <Note> llutz, i run that then type apt-get install sasl2-bin
[13:10] <Note> ?
[13:10] <llutz> Note: lsb_release -sc        what is the output?
[13:10] <ActionParsnip> Khaos: not sure then, are there bugs reported?
[13:10] <Note> llutz, quantal
[13:10] <khaos> ActionParsnip, i will search again in the ubuntuforums and I will add a bug if there is not something similar

[13:11] <ActionParsnip> Sogeking99: did you set different video output methods in vlc?
[13:11] <Dion> Does anyone here use the Opera browser?
[13:12] <Dion> Any opinions on it?
[13:12] <ActionParsnip> Sgt_Shultz: thanks
[13:12] <sogeking99> ActionParsnip, no, what are there?
[13:12] <ActionParsnip> Dion: irs great
[13:12] <Sgt_Shultz> the looked like a kaypro cpm box (monitor & drives in a "portable" box
[13:12] <ActionParsnip> Sogeking99: in prefs, rather than just throwing in more apps, try changing the settings
[13:13] <Note> llutz, great, thank you very much
[13:13] <Dion> I used to use Firefox, but it's become rather laggy and bloated, so I switched to Chrome... which quickly fell to the same fate. I tried Opera, and... well, I love it.
[13:13] <Note> The following NEW packages will be installed:

[13:13] <ActionParsnip> Dion: then use it if you think its great. Why did you even ask?
[13:14] <ithinktoomuch> ithinktoomuch - I have a 3g HSPA modem - Huawei which works only through the usb2.0 and not on usb3. I have tried usb_modeswitch and all kinds of solutions, but it is not working. lsusb on usb3 shows 12d1:1446 but on usb2 it shows 12d1:140b
[13:14] <Dion> Nobody ever talks about it. I was concerned that maybe there was some godawful flaw to it or something.

[13:15] <Comps_> i had to copy my data, to drobox, reinstall windows thanks to ubuntu's grub.... lost alot large data...
[13:15] <Dion> Ah, I see. Well, I'm not troubled by that, so that's good.
[13:15] <ithinktoomuch> @ActionParsnip - i have one usb2.0 port which is so close to the power socket that i cannot charge the laptop and use the internet together and it's very irritating at times
[13:15] <Sgt_Shultz> firefox, needs to clened occasionally to keep it trim
[13:16] <ActionParsnip> Ithinktoomuch: gotcha, is the system a desktop?
[13:16] <Comps_> i wont be usding ubuntu again...
[13:16] <Dion> Sgt_Shultz, I do clean it often, but lately it seems like it doesn't help as much, or the fox jumped in the mud right away.
[13:16] <ActionParsnip> Comps_: want a cookie?
[13:17] <ithinktoomuch> @ActionParsnip - lenovo g580 laptop
[13:17] <Comps_> ActionParsnip, grub killed my windows

[13:17] <sogeking99> ActionParsnip, Do you mean the output setting?

[13:18] <Comps_> i ab downloading over 200gbs cause of ubuntu insall aside of windows option
[13:18] <Comps_> am*
[13:19] <Comps_> it killed any options to boot windows right
[13:19] <Dion> Sgt_Shultz, I use Adblock. Used to use a script blocker, but it was indiscriminate and messed up a lot of things for me, so I tried to compromise. And I agree, Microsoft needs to keel over someday.

[13:20] <Comps_> not when grub breaks mbr..
[13:21] <MonkeyDust> Dion  people want to do an effort to get used to anything, but linux
[13:21]  * PatrickDickey has an *buntu related support question. :)
[13:21] <ikonia> PatrickDickey: then ask it instead of telling us you have a question
[13:21] <Dion> Comps_, mbr breaks are actually rather common, and surprisingly easy to fix. Just google it.
[13:21] <Comps_> i did,, never got support, had to lose data.
[13:21] <rekoil> bekks: gdisk sorted it out
[13:21] <rekoil> all good now :)
[13:21] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion, windows was always a single user system, made to adapt to www, where linux was built for www ....
[13:21] <Comps_> i did, problem is, its gpt..
[13:22] <PatrickDickey> Would a failing hard drive cause kernel panics? I was having issues with ubuntu, so I reinstalled with Lubuntu (both 12.10 and 12.04.1) and started getting random kernel panics. I installed Fedora, and had the same problem.
[13:22] <Comps_> grub killed my gtp
[13:22] <bekks> PatrickDickey: Maybe.
[13:22] <Sgt_Shultz> you buy windows @ kmart
[13:22] <bekks> PatrickDickey: Just check your harddrive and your RAM.
[13:22] <ikonia> PatrickDickey: io problems are a common cause of panics
[13:22] <k-joseph> hi every one, when i shrink some volume from the partition that has ubuntu installed, do i loose any data from it, is it dangerous thanks a lot
[13:22] <rekoil> Comps_: a partition is a partition, regardless of partition table, those kinds of errors can mostly always be solved, tools like testdisk help
[13:22] <Comps_> dion, i was here all last night stuck in ubuntu.
[13:23] <PatrickDickey> Well it's different processes and it's something along the lines of a SMP bug. (I can't remember the exact wording).
[13:23] <rekoil> i wonder how long fsck will take to run on a 6tb partition :P

[13:23] <dpurgert> PatrickDickey, boot off a livecd so you can run fsck on the HDD ... the memtest86 boot option is OK to test your ram (though, as with anything else here -- there's probably a handful of other utils)
[13:23] <Guest55036> please help xbmc keeps crashing ubuntu 12.10

[13:24] <PatrickDickey> One of the messages was general protection fault: 0000[#1] SMP It looks like it was kswapd that caused that one.
[13:24] <rekoil> i know that growing the raid took about 4 days

[13:25] <dpurgert> Comps_, did you tell it to use uefi-grub (or turn off UEFI in the BIOS)?
[13:25] <Comps_> grub killed my data, nothing ni did would make grub boot"windows 7"
[13:26] <Comps_> it did not let me
[13:26] <bekks> k-joseph: You may lose data when doing something wrong.
[13:26] <Comps_> i did not know
[13:26] <bekks> k-joseph: So create a backup before.
[13:26] <ikonia> Comps_: grub doesn't touch your data
[13:26] <Comps_> ubuntu fault, in my book
[13:26] <Sgt_Shultz> Google answer my questions "replacing windows boot code after linux"
[13:26] <ikonia> Comps_: your book is wrong
[13:26] <Comps_> no..
[13:26] <PatrickDickey> ikonia I've got a picture of part of one on my phone. Sometimes it was java that caused it, most of the time it was kswapd, and the last one was pulseaudio.
[13:26] <Dion> ^ Like I said... lol people giving up and whining at first problem.
[13:26] <Comps_> when u use live edition

[13:27] <ipv6hermit> I ran sudo nvidia-xconfig, rebooted and still I don't think  the drivers are loading
[13:27] <ikonia> PatrickDickey: I doubt very much java would cause a kernel panic
=== foufounette is now known as spacezinzin
[13:27] <ikonia> Comps_: grub does not touch your data in anyway
[13:27] <ipv6hermit> I run the nvidia x server settings utility adn it says "You  do not appear to be using the NVIDIA X Driver"
[13:27] <Comps_> to install. it should of used efigrub and not kill my boot:/
[13:27] <ikonia> ipv6hermit: gksudo nvidia-xconfig for x11 applications
[13:27] <Comps_> i know it didnt touch data
[13:27] <dpurgert> ikonia, he's complaining about "breaking" his win7 install because grub doesn't see it (apparently he's using UEFI - I still have an "open" motherboard, so no problems there ... not to mention no need to go back to another OS)
[13:27] <ikonia> Comps_: you just said it trashed your data
[13:27] <Comps_> it killed windows from booting again
[13:27] <Comps_> nope

[13:28] <ikonia> Sgt_Shultz: please, stop
[13:28] <ikonia> Comps_: I believe they are repairable
[13:28] <bekks> k-joseph: You may lose ALL data on your harddisk, depending on what you might do wrong. So create a backup before.
[13:28] <ikonia> Comps_: I've seen the guys in ##windows explain how to repair the efi boot process
[13:28] <PatrickDickey> ikonia, I'm guessing because that was the PID that it listed once. The one I'm looking at right now says CPU0 Pid: 30, comm: kswapd0 Tainted: G    W   3.7.2-2 (it's cut off at that point on my phone).
[13:28] <Comps_> then why bootrec shopw windows installs 0.
[13:28] <bekks> Comps_: I know the ARE repairable.
[13:28] <Comps_> hmmm
[13:29] <Guest55036> Its a package via the ubuntu software centre
[13:29] <Guest55036> if thats what you mean

[13:32] <Comps_> my windows isnt mbr, its gpt, uefi board, grub turned it to mbr, made so windows repair wouldnt work i used boot-repair, restored, gpt mbr default. got repair to see it, bootrec would not fix it.):
[13:32] <bekks> k-joseph: When you are "not prepared to have a backup" you do not have ANY important data. So create abackup beforesomething might goes wrong.
[13:32] <rekoil> i really really want to eliminate those 64mb prior to the start of the crypt
[13:32] <Dion> dpurgert is that Broadcom STA?
[13:32] <bekks> Comps_: Even on GPT, you always have a MBR.
[13:32] <rekoil> i wonder if there might be a way to do that
[13:32] <Comps_> but bootrec would not see it
[13:33] <Dion> Comps_ do you even know what MBR stands for?
[13:33] <Comps_> google search said uefi to old br cant be fixed
[13:33] <dpurgert> Dion, I dunno -- what wireless card is installed in the system?
[13:33] <bekks> Comps_: Which doesnt affect that fact that the is a MBR on EVERY harddisk.
[13:33] <Comps_> master boot record
[13:33] <Comps_> duh
[13:34] <Dion> Comps_ Exactly. Think about it.
[13:34] <ogist_> does ubuntu 12.10 not have the fire effect?
[13:34] <Comps_> the part i dont get is windows repair cant fix once grub touchd it:/
[13:34] <ogist_> i downloaded compiz-plugins-extra and the animations add-on is not showing up
[13:34] <Dion> dpurgert It's the only wireless driver it's offering, so I think it's safe to say that's the one.
[13:35] <Comps_> i fixed many mbrs, just never since uefi eh..
[13:35] <dpurgert> Dion, works for me :)
[13:35] <k-joseph> bekks: thanks alot,
[13:35] <ipv6hermit> I run sudo modprobe nvidia, and it says... FATAL: Module nvidia_current not found.
[13:35] <Dion> Of course, I can't download it until it reconnects... looks like I'm waiting here until it does.
[13:35] <Comps_> grub wont boot windows on my uefi
[13:36] <ActionParsnip> Comps_: still around?
[13:36] <Comps_> yup.
[13:36] <rekoil> how long does resize2fs take normally? is this a long process?
[13:36] <ikonia> rekoil: depends, there is no set time
[13:36] <bekks> rekoil: Yes, maybe.
[13:36] <PatrickDickey> ikonia out of curiosity, is there a way of debugging the kernel panic after it happens?
[13:36] <ActionParsnip> Comps_: asked in #grub ?
[13:36] <rekoil> ok :/
[13:37] <Comps_> good idea
[13:37] <Comps_> i will yap at them
[13:37] <rekoil> growing from 6tb to 8tb now
[13:37] <ikonia> PatrickDickey: it's a specialist skill, it's not "basic"
[13:37] <ogist_> can anyone answer me?
[13:37] <ogist_> im running ubuntu 12.10
[13:37] <rekoil> really wish i knew what i know now when i setup this raid :p
[13:37] <ogist_> compiz is not showing the animations add-on
[13:37] <ogist_> the settings manager
[13:37] <ogist_> i followed the instructions
[13:38] <ogist_> i just wanted the burn effect :)
[13:38] <Dion> I recall reading that it was strongly suggested to NOT use compiz on Ubuntu.
[13:38] <PatrickDickey> I may get a different drive anyhow. It's an older drive (and only 320GB). So it's probably time to upgrade anyhow.
[13:38] <wNz> I think compiz is default on ubuntu
[13:38] <ikonia> ogist_: be aware a lot of the plugins won't work with unity running as it is a compiz plugin itself
[13:39] <ogist_> E: Unable to locate package compiz-fusion-plugins-main
[13:39] <ogist_> E: Unable to locate package compiz-fusion-plugins-extra
[13:39] <ogist_> ikonia
[13:39] <ikonia> ogist_: that means the package you want does not exist
[13:39] <nabblet> hi, when i do minimal install and choose no packages in the install process - will the intall have dhcpcd?
[13:39] <ogist_> i know
[13:39] <ikonia> hence the error "does not exist"
[13:39] <ogist_> ikonia: are you familiar with compiz?
[13:39] <ikonia> ogist_: why are you trying to install it if it doesn't exist then
[13:39] <Dion> Oh good, wireless driver installing rather quickly.
[13:39] <ogist_> ikonia: there are tons of websites telling me that it does exist
[13:40] <ogist_> where did it go
[13:40] <ogist_> i installed compiz-plugins-extra
[13:40] <compdoc> nabblet, you mean ubuntu server?
[13:40] <ogist_> and there is no animations add-on
[13:40] <ikonia> ogist_: it doesn't exist in your ubuntu version, probably because it doesn't work with unity
[13:40] <ogist_> ah ok
[13:40] <Comps_> can i install ubuntu with out using grub?
[13:40] <ogist_> so ubuntu 12.10 sucks
[13:40] <ikonia> Comps_: no
[13:40] <BlackDex> ActionParsnip: I have fixed my random logout.. it seemed to be bad xorg.conf or drivers.. removed the xorg.conf and reinstalled the video drivers... everything is working now
[13:40] <ikonia> ogist_: don't use it then
[13:40] <ogist_> i should have installed 12.04
[13:40] <Sgt_Shultz> xubuntu
[13:40] <ikonia> ogist_: 12.04 still uses unity
[13:40] <Comps_> then so i cant dual boot:/
[13:40] <ogist_> ikonia: what's your problem,?
[13:40] <PatrickDickey> ogist_ You can always install a different desktop that uses the animations.
[13:40] <ikonia> ogist_: I have no problem
[13:41] <ogist_> ikonia: you are acting like a little faggot
[13:41] <PatrickDickey> Comps_ why can't you dual-boot?
[13:41] <ikonia> ogist_: you don't like 12.10, don't use it
[13:41] <ikonia> it's a simple problem/solution
[13:41] <Comps_> grub wont boot windows on my board:/
[13:41] <rekoil> ok, resize2fs didn't take too long either
[13:41] <rekoil> awesome!
[13:41] <Dion> Excellent! The driver warning disappeared after I installed the wireless driver. Guess that means I got them. So the nvidia graphics and wireless is all I needed? Then the Update Manager updates and then reboot?
[13:41] <ikonia> Comps_: it will you just have to set the efi stuff up
[13:41] <rekoil> all in all, 4 days >.<
[13:41] <Dion> Just making sure.
[13:41] <rekoil> stupid raid reconstruction
[13:41] <dpurgert> Dion, sounds about right :)
[13:41] <Comps_> ikonia, can u walk me thru?
[13:42] <rekoil> thanks for the help guys
[13:42]  * rekoil fires up bouncer
[13:42] <ikonia> Comps_: not personally no, the guys in ##windows can possible do it, I've seen them fix a lot of EFI issues
[13:42] <Comps_> i just dont want break windows this time:/
[13:42] <ActionParsnip> Blackdex: sweet
[13:43] <Comps_> i am just trying get ubuntu, cause my new job needs it.:/
[13:43] <PatrickDickey> If I remember right (Comps_ and ikonia), uEFI will let you pick the operating system, and if you choose Windows, it will load the windows bootloader, if you choose Linux, it will go through Grub. I could be way off on that though.
[13:43] <Dion> You guys are very helpful, thank you. I'll report if it worked after all after it updates all 487 (dear god).
[13:43] <DereC> hi guys, try to stop kernel updates, ive tried to pin kernel version but it doeasn help, will removing unnatended updates help me to stop kernel updates?
[13:43] <Comps_> my dont
[13:43] <pindol> how can i reed m4v with ubuntu?
[13:43] <Comps_> its msi uefi
[13:43] <PatrickDickey> Comps_ is there any reason why you can't use Ubuntu in a virtual machine?
[13:43] <ikonia> Comps_: repeatig the same thing over and over, won't change anything
[13:43] <ikonia> repeating
[13:43] <Comps_> i rather get full power?:/
=== foufounette is now known as spacezinzin
[13:43] <ActionParsnip> Comps_: could virtualize Ubuntu
[13:44] <Sgt_Shultz> Comps, version of windows ?
[13:44] <Comps_> windows 7 ult
[13:44] <Comps_> 64 bit
[13:44] <Dion> Wow, wireless driver certainly helped. It's staying connected.
[13:44] <Sgt_Shultz> hehe

[13:44] <ActionParsnip> Dion: sweet,  get fully updated
[13:44] <dpurgert> actually, linux (any variant) isn't that bad in a vm ... trouble is you don't get hardware access (as easily)
[13:45] <xsumi5> Hey everyone, I have an odd problem with Ubuntu 12.10.
[13:45] <Comps_> i am wanting pci access level.
[13:45] <dpurgert> xsumi5, what's up?
[13:45] <Dion> actionparsnip In the process of doing that. 487 updates. Geez.
[13:45] <bekks> Comps_: What does UEFO has to do with PCI access?
[13:45] <Comps_> why cant ubuntu be easy anymore):
[13:45] <ikonia> Comps_: ubuntu is easy
[13:46] <xsumi5> I have two types of headsets to plug into the headphones jack on the laptop
[13:46] <PatrickDickey> Comps_ which board is it?
[13:46] <ikonia> Comps_: please stop blaming your hardware on ubuntu
[13:46] <ikonia> Comps_: I've offered a place that maybe able to help you, yet you ignore this and just keep repeating the same thing over and over
[13:46] <dpurgert> Comps_, no, what I meant is that there's a few hoops to hop through with a VM to hit the hardware directly
[13:46] <Comps_> no, i cant same to be able install ubuntu wout messing up mbr.:/
[13:46] <Dion> Comps_ Oh, I'm not even handling you, and I'm sick of your whining! Maybe people will help you more if you stop crying and listen!
[13:46] <ActionParsnip> Dion: yes, its a fresh install
[13:46] <xsumi5> If I plug in a set o headphones that has vol control and a mic the keyboard will stop working.
[13:46] <ikonia> Comps_: again - not ubuntu's issue, you have picked a hardware platform that requires a specific boot config
[13:46] <ikonia> Comps_: ubuntu does support that option if you set it up correctly
[13:46] <ActionParsnip> Dion: ever clean installed xp?
[13:47] <Comps_> thats i been asking for:/
[13:47] <radek_> radek
[13:47] <xsumi5> If I plug in a standard set of headphones without a mic or vol control it works
[13:47] <radek_> co tam
[13:47] <Comps_> i never had efi before
[13:47] <ikonia> Comps_: and I've told you what to do, get your windows setup working again
[13:47] <xsumi5> If I plug the standard headphones before the headphones with a mic and vol control that works too
[13:47] <ikonia> Comps_: then move to install ubuntu
[13:47] <Dion> ActionParsnip I did that on the Acer to replace Windows 7 (it was being very troublesome). That's how I busted my MBR for the first time, haha.
[13:47] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, yeah ... but unlike ubuntu (or anything sane for that matter) it doesn't touch the internet til the offline installers for SP# get installed
[13:47] <ikonia> Comps_: the guys in ##windows will help you get your windows efi boot setup back
[13:47] <Comps_> i lost that one, i am fresh new copy.
[13:47] <radek_> fuck
[13:48] <Dion> Or clean install meant otherwise..?
[13:48] <ikonia> radek_: unacceptable language, please don't do that
[13:48] <Comps_> just want to install ubuntu aside windows not mess up mbr 3rd time:/
[13:48] <xsumi5> It seems that Ubuntu is getting the wrong driver / module / etc when I plug in the Logitech UE200 headphones in first.
[13:48] <dpurgert> Dion, "clean install" as in "fresh off the CD"
[13:48] <ActionParsnip> Dpurgert: assuming they are accessible offline
[13:48] <PatrickDickey> !uefi | Comps_ have you read this page, by chance?
[13:48] <ubottu> Comps_ have you read this page, by chance?: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[13:48] <ikonia> Comps_: you've said that mulitple times
[13:49] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, have my own set of USB keys for that (joys of being the family IT guy ;))
[13:49] <ActionParsnip> Dpurgert: same, plus its my job
[13:49] <Dion> dpurgert Alright. Then I don't think that applies.
[13:49] <WotWhere> am trying to install a 3G DataCard for ntwk access .. the default program that was bundled for a gui is asking for qt3 runtime library..
[13:49] <WotWhere> I have already updated the Qt4 package from the packmanager..
[13:49] <WotWhere> I used Unity's naetwork connection manager to configure the mobile Broadband setings and it works.. am using it right now
[13:49] <WotWhere> But, do want to have the softwares gui.. for easier troubleshooting.. anyone?
[13:49] <xsumi5> I have a work around by plugging in a standard pair of headphones then my Logitech headphones.
[13:50] <xsumi5> It's just annoying
[13:50] <Dion> Here's to hoping Ringtail will be as amazing as they claim. 12 wasn't exactly impressive. I like some of the new features they're previewing though.
[13:50] <Comps_> so i have ubuntu 64 bit usb installer, that ok?
[13:50] <ikonia> Comps_: 64bit is fine, 32bit is fine
[13:50] <Comps_> so i use something esle this time?
[13:50] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, Windows administration?
[13:51] <ikonia> Comps_: what do you mean ? something else
[13:51] <ikonia> Comps_: is there a reason you are ignoring what's been said to you and just repeating the same thing over and over
[13:51] <thec4ke> WotWhere: try installing libqt4-qt3support
[13:51] <bekks> Comps_: No, just use the 64bit installer.
[13:51] <Dion> I have a feeling this is going to become a Not Always Right story.
[13:52] <xsumi5> It's Ubuntu 12.10 64bit
[13:52] <Comps_> ikonia, shhhh, i been reading the page, stop ur insaults:/

[13:53] <WotWhere> thec4ke:  just installed all packs with QT4 in the name.. do i need to restart?
[13:53] <xsumi5> what's the prob with efi
[13:53] <thec4ke> WotWhere: probably not
[13:53] <Comps_> -.-
[13:53] <ActionParsnip> Wotwhere: can't hurt to try
[13:54] <itsrachelfish> uh hi #ubuntu
[13:54] <xsumi5> I had an issue with efi and the uefi bios on this laptop.
[13:54] <varikonniemi> after installing kde the screen goes to sleep with kde:s settings also under unity.. how can i change this?
[13:54] <WotWhere> ok restart it is
[13:54] <PatrickDickey> xsumi5 Comps_ is trying to dual-boot Windows and Ubuntu, but it won't let him boot into windows.
[13:54] <itsrachelfish> I just updated to 12.10 and ccsm no longer has options for alt + tab or the ring switcher
[13:54] <itsrachelfish> what gives
[13:54] <xsumi5> The first install of 64bit ubuntu didn't go well so I tried to use 32 bit and the laptop would no longer see the thumb drive
[13:54] <swarfega> erm ive just had a system notification that 13.04 is out and im downloading it
[13:55] <dpurgert> ActionParsnip, sounds good.  soon as I get the time/money, I'm gonna have my own stuff to maintain at home -- figure I'm gonna be living here for a while, might as well do it right
[13:55] <ikonia> swarfega: you have not
[13:55] <PatrickDickey> itsrachelfish they might not be compatible with Unity.
[13:55] <swarfega> :o
[13:55] <itsrachelfish> I'm not using unity
[13:55] <xsumi5> Thanks Patrick
[13:55] <swarfega> what is it then?
[13:55] <ikonia> swarfega: the only way you would get that notifiction is if you have configured your system for development use, eg: changed your sources.list
[13:55] <xsumi5> Does it only go into Ubuntu
[13:55] <ActionParsnip> Dpurgert: definitely :-)
[13:55] <ikonia> or run update-managed -d
[13:55] <swarfega> so i should cancel this?
[13:55] <itsrachelfish> And I had the ring switcher/alt tab options in 12.10 on my other laptop
[13:55] <itsrachelfish> where did it go?
[13:56] <PatrickDickey> xsumi5 you'll have to ask Comps_ I don't know.
[13:56] <Dion> Comps_ You know how sometimes there's this one customer who keeps screaming "I want a small meal!" without specifying what he wants in it and just keeps repeating without giving even a hint to what he actually wants in the small meal? Yeah, you're doing that right now. Backtrack, think of other details you could give them so they can actually figure out what's wrong?
[13:56] <swarfega> ok i cancelled the install
[13:56] <PatrickDickey> swarfega do you have your updater set to notify you for every new version? ANd as for cancelling it, if you're at the point where it's actually *doing* the upgrade, then no.

[13:57] <biopyte> hi, can someone confirm: oracle java 7 update 11 is broken?! (only updated last week). info on the web is rare. https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/34c80da0-8974-4ac6-83c1-6b72eab6d13e/entry/red_alert_java_7_update_11_confirmed_to_be_vulnerable_researcher?lang=en    anyway, the firefox plugin is disabled.
[13:58] <ActionParsnip> Dion: updates going ok?
[13:58] <ikonia> biopyte: no, we can't confirm this, this is ubuntu support, oracle support java, not ubuntu
[13:58] <Sgt_Shultz> disable JAVA
[13:58] <biopyte> most of you won't bother, but for some applications a working oracle java is essential.( unfortunately)
[13:58] <PatrickDickey> biopyte I read something about that on Sopho's facebook page. but, I haven't dug into it  at all. Either way, you're better off with Update 11 than anything earlier.
[13:58] <ikonia> biopyte: I'm using Oracle java as I need it, but as I said, Oracle maintain java - not ubuntu, so ubuntu can confirm nothing
[13:59] <ActionParsnip> Biopyte: I don't even use it :-)
[13:59] <Dion> ActionParsnip - Taking forever, barely any progress, but the connection's going strong thankfully so I can wait it out. ...unlike the one I'm on right now.
[13:59] <Sgt_Shultz> but homeland secruity can ...
[13:59] <Dion> Let me see if I can get on here on the other one.
[13:59] <biopyte> ok guys, i know "i dont use java, its crap anyway"
[13:59] <biopyte> not the point here
[13:59] <ActionParsnip> Dion: let it have irs fun :-)
[13:59] <PatrickDickey> I've got one of those applications installed. CrashPlan backup. It shows up as java in my system monitor, but it's their service or their desktop engine.
[14:00] <dpurgert> Sgt_Shultz, they can neither confirm nor deny any allegations made ...
[14:00] <ActionParsnip> Biopyte: not that its crap, I just have no use for it
[14:00] <Dion> Oh dammit. Connection went down after all.
[14:00] <biopyte> anyway, java 7-11 on firefox is disabled.  .... ridiculous
[14:01] <PatrickDickey> biopyte https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Java+7+Update+11+Still+has+a+Flaw/14983
[14:01] <biopyte> so, you are lucky that i told you  :-)
[14:01] <dpurgert> Dion, aw ... guess the driver is still touchy (did you happen to restart after installing it?)
[14:01] <ActionParsnip> Biopyte: did yoy install it via ppa?
[14:01] <Sgt_Shultz> dpurgert,  JAVA never unistalls itselfs, millions of system with older copies, phones, Android based on it, i dont think it over ....
[14:01] <Dion> Dpurgert - It said it was already enabled, only graphics driver needed restarting. I guess it does need restart after all.

[14:04] <bipul> ikonia,  can you please tell me in more details about IPredirect and why it is not enabled in ubuntu. :)
[14:04] <ikonia> bipul: because it's not needed by default
[14:04] <PatrickDickey> itsrachelfish you didn't try that before?
[14:04] <hylian> i need to install the libSDL 32 bit libraries, but I am running Ubuntu 64bit, and don't see an option in synaptic for anything other than libsdl1.2debian, which is already installed... can i install the 32 bit version somehow?
[14:04] <biopyte> Patrick, i think so too, its disabled by firebox and thats it ... game over  ... by the way, the firefox guys dont answer the question in their channel
[14:04] <bipul> !ipredirects
[14:04] <ikonia> hylian: you don't want to to that as it will overwrite the 64bit libs and cause a problem
[14:04] <biopyte> anyway ...
[14:05] <itsrachelfish> PatrickDickey: I didn't because no one suggested it :>

[14:06] <PatrickDickey> biopyte They're probably taking the same position that we are. That it's not their product. If you check the link I gave you (isc.sans.edu), they refer to the CERT advisory, which lists all of the affected vendors and versions.
[14:06] <hylian> ikonia: hmm, well i have a program called powder toy that is constantly giving me this error: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[14:06] <ikonia> hylian: that can also be a 64bit library
[14:07] <biopyte> Patrick, they should according to this page   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/blocked/p184
[14:07] <Dion> Eugh. Router itself's touchy too sometimes. Both laptops went down, had to reset the router.
[14:07] <Guest78498> Hi all, Q). Whats the best solution to desktop misconfiguration ? i was running 10.04 upgraded to 12.04 had a few issues i resolved but am now getting graphical glitches, effects cause crashes etc... i did a apt-get install --reinstall gnome-session, but i still getting issues, i need to stabilize the system as im not quite ready for rebuild..
[14:07] <hylian> ikonia: i looked up the error code, and according to the libSDL group, it means sdl isn't installed. Since it is installed, I asumed it meant that I need the 32 bit version...
[14:07] <ikonia> hylian: is that file on the system....?
[14:07] <biopyte> Patrick, actually it tells "Linux"  i wonder if windows is also affected ... probably
[14:08] <Sgt_Shultz> bipul, firefox & ghortery or anonymoX addons ?
[14:08] <fedeoro> ciao
[14:08] <PatrickDickey> biopyte everyone is affected. Java is write once run everywhere. it uses it's own Virtual Machine.
[14:08] <fedeoro> buona domenica a tutti
[14:08] <hylian> ikonia: are you asking me if libSDL is installed, or if powder-toy is on the hard drive? in both cases the answer is yes.

[14:08] <fedeoro> list
[14:08] <Dion> Sgt_Shultz I use Ghostery. Should I be concerned?
[14:09] <ikonia> hylian: I'm asking you if the library it's complaining about is on your physical file system

[14:10] <Dion> Sgt_shultz internet went down a bit so I missed the comment, saw you mention that, got concerned. Nevermind then.
[14:10] <hylian> ikonia: according to apt/synaptic, the answer is yes.
[14:10] <sawyer_> where can i find explanations on removed packages? (why they were removed, when, etc.)
[14:10] <ikonia> hylian: that's not what I asked
[14:10] <biopyte> Patrick, i wondered about one thing ... i cant even start locally the java console "file not found" ... so they have acces to my ubuntu box and delete files?
[14:10] <ikonia> hylian: I asked if the file it's complaining about is on your physical file system
[14:10] <hylian> ikonia: i guess then I don't understand the question.
[14:10] <hylian> ikonia: yes it is.
[14:11] <somsip> sawyer_: /var/log/apt/history.log
[14:11] <biopyte> that happened also recently with version 7 - 10
[14:11] <biopyte> today again
[14:11] <sawyer_> somsip, i mean by Ubuntu itself
[14:11] <PatrickDickey> biopyte no they can't delete files on your computer. All they can do is block it in their browser.
[14:11] <ikonia> hylian: where is it
[14:11] <sawyer_> i had a package that was removed, and it's no longer available in Ubuntu, i'm wondering what happened
[14:11] <hylian> ikonia: it's in /home/denny/powder/
[14:11] <ikonia> hylian: then it's not installed by apt
[14:11] <Sgt_Shultz> Dion, it all cool, 42 years in pc's tell me the numbers go up, i seen more ram than field of sheep, the hardware is cheaper, roll ubuntu 4 phones

=== sysadmin is now known as Guest34352
[14:12] <ikonia> hylian: and that's why your software is failing as it won't be looking in /home/denny/powerder for dynamic librarie
[14:12] <somsip> sawyer_: If you mean a GUI to view the log, I don't know
[14:12] <biopyte> Patrick, but something happened to the files in the java folder ... usually you can start the java console locally ...
[14:12] <sawyer_> it used to be available, it no longer is, and i can't even compile it because of another package that was removed (libccrtp1)
[14:12] <hylian> ikonia: no, apt/synaptic has no version of "the powder toy" available. but this software has always run before i switched to 64 bit ubuntu.
[14:12] <sawyer_> somsip, i mean an application that Ubuntu removed from their repositories
[14:12] <ikonia> hylian: what you've just said makes no sense
[14:13] <biopyte> Patrick, to put it altogether , java is totally blocked , not only in firefox ....
[14:13] <ikonia> hylian: you said apt/synaptic said the library was installed, I asked you where and you said it's in place that apt-get would not install it to,
[14:13] <somsip> sawyer_: packages.ubuntu.org and links from there?
[14:13] <PatrickDickey> biopyte that's odd. what happens when you run java -version in a terminal?
[14:13] <hylian> ikonia: i used to run 32 bit ubuntu until about a month aqo, powder toy ran. Then i switched to 64 bit because I intend on installing more than 3.2 gb of ram, and now powder oy does not run,.
[14:14] <PatrickDickey> hylian did you install ia32libs?
[14:14] <hylian> ikonia: i thought you meant "the powder toy."
[14:14] <ikonia> hylian: what is the name of the file it's complaining about
[14:14] <sawyer_> somsip, you must mean packages.ubuntu.com, .org leads to something else altogether
[14:14] <hylian> libsdl
[14:14] <biopyte> Patrick, java version "1.7.0_11"     ... as normal
[14:14] <ikonia> hylian: no, that is not the name of the file
[14:14] <ikonia> hylian: give me the full name of the file
[14:14] <hylian> PatrickDickey: i don't know, i'll check it out
[14:14] <PatrickDickey> biopyte then java is working. It wouldn't have given you that, if it wasn't.
[14:14] <somsip> sawyer_: ok
[14:15] <hylian> ikonia: i don't know the name of the file.
[14:15] <ikonia> hylian: you do you gave it me earlier
[14:15] <sawyer_> somsip, so, as i was saying, this package was removed: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=twinkle&searchon=names&suite=quantal&section=all
[14:15] <sawyer_> it doesn't say *when* and especially **why** it was removed
[14:15] <ikonia> hylian: while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0: cannot open
[14:15] <biopyte> Patrick, ok, but when i try to start the console from the ubuntu console i get an error .... but, anyway thats not so important
[14:16] <ikonia> hylian: come on - please put some effort in / follow what you're saying, it's impossible to help you if you're not giving correct details
[14:16] <hylian> ikonia: that's all it gives me, it never ends the error with the name of the file.
[14:16] <sawyer_> somsip, exists in Precise (http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=twinkle&searchon=names&suite=precise&section=all), removed in Quantal (http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=twinkle&searchon=names&suite=quantal&section=all)
[14:16] <biopyte> Patrick, i mean the ubuntu menu in gnome classic
[14:16] <Dion> Hey guys, should I skip the software updates for now and restart for the driver updates, THEN do software updates? Is that safe to do? The cnnection is being horribly shaky and software update is failing a lot now.
[14:16] <ikonia> hylian: right, so I've asked you 3 times now "is that file on your system"
[14:16] <bipul> Can any one suggest me some good and working tcp server application. for ubuntu
[14:16] <ikonia> bipul: tcp server applications ??? what ?
[14:16] <ikonia> bipul: what do you want to do/achieve ?
[14:16] <PatrickDickey> sawyer_ http://askubuntu.com/questions/226360/ubuntu-12-10-how-to-get-sip-phone-twinkle-latest-version-working-using-deb-or they link to the removal bug there.
[14:17] <hylian> ikonia: how can I know if the file exists, if the error doesn't tell me what file it is or where it resides on the system?
[14:17] <bipul> ikonia, i am trying to do network emulation. and i need tcp server application.
[14:17] <ikonia> hylian: the error tells you the exact file name
[14:17] <ikonia> bipul: network emmulation ?????
[14:17] <ikonia> bipul: I'm sorry, you are making no sense
[14:17] <hylian> ikonia: no it does not. this is the error in it's entirety: error while loading shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
[14:18] <PatrickDickey> sawyer_ per http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=673900 They're retiring it upstream (in Debian), so that's why it's no longer offered.
[14:18] <ubottu> Debian bug 673900 in ftp.debian.org "RM: twinkle -- ROM; dead upstream, obsolete components (KDE3/ QT3/ libccrtp1)" [Normal,Open]
[14:18] <ikonia> hylian: libSDL-1.2.so.0: is the file !!!!
[14:18] <ikonia> hylian: looks at the error " error while loading  shared libraries: libSDL-1.2.so.0:
[14:18] <RawProduce> when I try to create a mysql user with:   GRANT ALL ON foo.* TO bar@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'fizz';, I cannot login to the mysql console as that user -   changing localhost to the hostname resolves this
[14:18] <sawyer_> PatrickDickey, i see
[14:18] <bipul> Yes Network simulation-2 with network emulation.
[14:18] <ikonia> error while loading shared libraries: then it lists the library
[14:18] <RawProduce> why is this happening?
[14:18] <biopyte> Patrick, so tell the webupd8 buddy, that some work on the java installer is coming in again    ;-)
[14:18] <RawProduce> 12.04
[14:18] <sawyer_> PatrickDickey, thank you!
[14:19] <hylian> ikonia: ok, so then where does libSDL reside? I know it is installed via synaptic, because I looked for it in synaptic. but I have no idea where.
[14:19] <RawProduce> reason I'm asking in #ubuntu is because I haven't seen this behaviour with any other distro
[14:19] <ikonia> RawProduce: user@localhost = can only login from localhost
[14:19] <Dion> Anyone? Should I go ahead and restart after driver updates and do the software update after instead?
[14:19] <ikonia> RawProduce: because you've set th ehostname when you granted the permissions
[14:19] <PatrickDickey> No problem sawyer_.
[14:19] <sawyer_> have a great day!
[14:19] <RawProduce> ikonia: I am connecting from localhost
[14:19] <ikonia> hylian: do a search on the file system
[14:19] <Joshun> hi
[14:19] <Joshun> how do you import your own gpg key?
[14:19] <RawProduce> it's a server, I've SSH'ed in
[14:19] <hylian> ikonia, ok I will
[14:19] <Joshun> *locally that is
[14:20] <Joshun> so that it can be used
[14:20] <Joshun> under seahorse it isn't a 'personal' key even though its my key
[14:20] <bipul> ikonia, i am trying to animate live traffics packet's of two system on NAM (network animator). and i need any TCP server application which is best suited for ubuntu.
[14:20] <ikonia> bipul: a tcp application server makes no sense, sorry
[14:21] <bipul> oh ok i got it now.
[14:21] <PatrickDickey> RawProduce in your mysql configuration file, is the hostname set to localhost or a hostname? If it's set to just a hostname, then it doesn't recognize "localhost".
[14:21] <bipul> Thank you for you valuable suggestion.
[14:21] <ikonia> RawProduce: do mysql -u username -h localhost -p
[14:21] <ikonia> RawProduce: you will fine it works
[14:22] <alex_> hi! I am trying to install Ubuntu 12.10 in a HP Pavilion (http://bizsupport1.austin.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?objectID=c03529716&lang=en&cc=us&taskId=101&prodSeriesId=5322275&prodTypeId=321957). The hard disk doesn't appear on the installation process. I was reading about FakeRaids, but the solution seems extremely dangerous: http://askubuntu.com/a/198438
[14:22] <Sgt_Shultz> bipul, maybe a quick google 4 "ubuntu network traffic analyzer"
[14:22] <ikonia> RawProduce: if you don't want to force it to lock to localhost, then grant the permissions to user@% or user@the_host_name_you_want_to_lock_to
[14:22] <RawProduce> ikonia: hm, that does indeed work

[14:28] <dan1726> hey, i'm have a bit of trouble with MySQL.. With the bind address.. i'm trying to connect to the server remotely so i set the bind address to 0.0.0.0. Then in the python code I tried connecting to the ip address of the database server...
[14:28] <dan1726> is there something else i have to do?

[14:29] <RawProduce> the hostname is not localhost
[14:29] <RawProduce> yet it connects assuming host=localhost

[14:30] <Dion> sgt_shultz You can relax now, connection is stable and update manager is working properly.
[14:30] <ikonia> RawProduce: do a show grants and see if it's got localhost as the higher grant in the order

It's attached to my _desktop_ using a simple USB adapter (480MB/s) I am using the "wipe" program to securely delete the data because I'm going to sell the HDD.  It's giving me ETA of 1week!  I don't want to wait that long.  I want this done in a few hours at the most.  What alternatives are there?

[15:09] <denebeim> domain matches (using the default), works find ubuntu/ubuntu

[15:11] <dpurgert> deadmund, yeah, that's gonna take a while since you're over USB (remember that the 480MB/s is theoretical maximum)
[15:11] <denebeim> it's looking like idmapd is using the uid value to search for the login  (iow '1004' instead of 'denebeim')
[15:11] <MiningMarsh> deadmund, there is always the simple dd if=/dev/urandom of=/hard/drive/path. You can play witht he blocksize until you find a good one.
[15:11] <note_> llutz, /etc/cyrus/ doesn't exist
[15:11] <llutz> note_: where is your imapd.conf located?
[15:12] <note_>  /etc/imapd.conf
[15:12] <deadmund> dpurgert: yeah, I mean, is there an alternative data wiping program that does every 4th bit or something?  I think re-writing _every_ bit of data is a waste of time.  I mean, the harddrive wasn't full of data to begin with, and a good chunk of what was on there was a copy of windows 7

[15:14] <ubottu> Sgt_Shultz, please see my private message
[15:14] <llutz> note_: looks right, sorry no idea then
[15:14] <note_> :/
[15:14] <note_> thank you
[15:14] <denebeim> any ideas dpurgert?
[15:14] <MiningMarsh> deadmund, well, data is copied in blocks. So a bs=1mb makes copies 1 mebabyte at a time. Basically, drives will be faster or slower depending on the blocksize, as they all have a different sized internal cache to hold the data. I find that 8mb is a good block size usually.
[15:14] <alami> hello how can i run aprogram in verbose mode
[15:15] <MiningMarsh> deadmund, and a higher blocksize is not always better.
[15:15] <denebeim> alami, it's usually either -v or -d
[15:15] <WotWhere> need qt3 help using Gnome
[15:15] <WotWhere> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1552378/
[15:15] <SpartanF31> hallo!
[15:15] <iceroot> alami: depending on the program, normally -v
[15:15] <deadmund> MiningMarsh: So it's still re-writing every bit on the drive but it's doing so in chunks.  What does this wipe program do?
[15:15] <denebeim> alami, but that's up to the program
[15:15] <llutz> note_: old but maybe this gives you an idea where to look at http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-822388.html
[15:16] <MiningMarsh> deadmund, no idea.
[15:16] <denebeim> alami, -h almost always works for getting help, you might also want to type 'man commandname'
[15:16] <deadmund> MiningMarsh: Alright, thanks for the help.  Hopefully dd is faster
[15:17] <SpartanF31> My computer is on lan with few other computer. There is a way for me to see in samba shares the lan available machines  and at the same time hide my one?
[15:17] <MiningMarsh> deadmund, if you want to find a good blocksize
[15:18] <MiningMarsh> just do somehting like time dd if=/dev/urandom of=/file/on/that/drive with different blocksizes. Find which is fastest.
[15:18] <defer_> I want to map < and > to one key how can i do it?
[15:18] <deadmund> MiningMarsh: why urandom and not random?
[15:18] <bekks> deadmund: the blocksize should be the same size as the hdd cache size for optimized performance.
[15:18] <WotWhere> where can i find libqt4-qt3support lib ?
[15:18] <WotWhere> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1552378/
[15:19] <MiningMarsh> deadmund, random has the possibility of running out, urandom lasts forever. Just a good diea to always use urandom.
[15:19] <deadmund> bekks: MiningMarsh how can I tell which is "faster" sudo dd if=/dev/random of=/dev/sdc1 bs=8192  gives no output until it's finished.
[15:19] <bekks> MiningMarsh: /dev/[u]random is pretty slow and normally slower than a harddisk. And writing into a file is not a good idea since you have a filesystem layer, which affects performance, too.
[15:19] <mguy> deadmund: you can send the dd pid a signal and it will repot
[15:19] <note_> llutz, hello, after reading that i realised the guide i followed (same guide the guy from that archive followed) and i didn't uncomment admin: cyrus
[15:20] <note_> after uncommented it allowed me to create it
[15:20] <note_> thank you
[15:20] <bekks> deadmund: It will never finish until the target throws an EOF error.
[15:20] <MiningMarsh> bekks, well, zero is fast but a little less secure. And thats the best way I know of to find a good blocksize.
[15:20] <MiningMarsh> gparted uses the same.
[15:20] <llutz> note_: things start to work if you do it right :)
[15:20] <bekks> MiningMarsh: I just pointed out why thats a pretty useless way to find a valuable blocksize.
[15:20] <alami> whow can i fix that http://pastebin.com/yCqcUdnx
[15:21] <FlowRiser> Hey guys, i have a notebook and i'm looking for a lightweight linux distro;  I narrowed it down to either Xubuntu or Lubuntu. So uhmm, Xubuntu vs Lubuntu ?
[15:21] <deadmund> mguy: thanks
[15:21] <SpartanF31>  hallo! My computer is on lan with few other computer. There is a way for me to see in samba shares the lan available machines  and at the same time hide my one?
[15:21] <Salvadi> .xchat2/budus.so
[15:21] <bekks> deadmund: Usable results can be produced with using a bs=16M (when having 16M cache on your hdd) and a count= value that exceeds the physical RAM to ensure you will be using the I/O cache instead your harddisk.
[15:22] <OerHeks> FlowRiser, Xubuntu needs 512 and Lubuntu can run on 256 mb systemmemory
[15:22] <llutz> deadmund: if you want some status from dd, use"killall -USR1 dd" in a 2nd terminal, it will force dd to tell you something
[15:22] <deadmund> bekks: Thanks, how can i determine the cache on this hdd?
[15:23] <FlowRiser> OerHeks, how about their desktop environments ? I'm thinking of heavily customizing them ...
[15:23] <bekks> deadmund: By looking up the model at the manufacturers site.
[15:23] <NERO_> Hey! I'm looking for help regarding the battery management in my lenovo G580 laptop.
[15:23] <NERO_> I've ubuntu 12.04 installed.
[15:23] <daftykins> SpartanF31: why?
[15:23] <deadmund> bekks: ugh, thanks
[15:23] <OerHeks> FlowRiser, try them both and see what you like
[15:24] <note_> llutz, after doing all of this, is it even possible for me to add this email address to a mail app, like someone would with googlemail etc?
[15:24] <FlowRiser> NERO_, look in settings, you have power management
[15:24] <dan1726> thanks guys I found out what was wrong... remote access to mysql is block by default in iptables..
[15:24] <alex_> I finally was able to install ubuntu with Windows 8, but... I can not see grub or any bootloader, it always boot in Windows. Any suggestion?
[15:24] <FlowRiser> OerHeks, will do, thanks for the info
[15:24] <deadmund> llutz: that command does not give any output
[15:24] <llutz> note_: sure
[15:24] <FlowRiser> alex_, did you install windows before or after linux ?
[15:24] <note_> I can!?
[15:25] <llutz> deadmund: it gives output in the terminal dd is running
[15:25] <deadmund> llutz: Oh!  I see it does on the dd terminal
[15:25] <deadmund> llutz: yeah, thanks.  sorry! :P
[15:25] <SpartanF31> daftykins: becouse i'm on a public network and that net isn't mine, so i want to avoid my notebook is visible in windows network places
[15:25] <NERO_> In brief: I've had this battery management software for windows that charges the battery for 60% and runs on AC power. However I'm unable to find a s/w in ubuntu.
[15:25] <deadmund> this is still going to take a _long_ time
[15:25] <daftykins> SpartanF31: so you've already got it installed and some shares configured, i assume?
[15:25] <FlowRiser> SpartanF31, Usually windows users don't know that they can see other pcs on lan =)
[15:26] <daftykins> FlowRiser: of course they do, you open explorer and it shows them...
[15:26] <SpartanF31> daftykins: exactly.
[15:26] <deadmund> As I said before, I don't need to re-write every bit.  I think the fastest way to do this would be to re-write every 10th bit or something.  This would still thoroughly scramble the data but theoretically would take 1/10th the time.  Is there any tool like this?
[15:27] <note_> llutz, where do i find out my incoming/outgoing mail server that I 'potentially' would have set up with postfix/cyrus
[15:27] <NERO_> Flowriser are u on?
[15:27] <alami> how can i fix that http://pastebin.com/yCqcUdnx
[15:27] <mguy> deadmund: What are you trying to do? Secure erase a drive?
[15:27] <daftykins> deadmund: what's up? are you trying to zero fill a drive but it's too slow? are you writing with a blocksize of 2M when running dd? that speeds it up
[15:28] <deadmund> mguy: Yes, I'm going to sell it.  The data isn't really sensitive, just personal
[15:28] <FlowRiser> NERO_, you are vague about software charging your battery ...
[15:28] <llutz> note_: point your mailprogram to the hostname/ip of that server you just configured
[15:28] <mguy> deadmund: fill it with zeros it shoudl run at the top speed of your disk
[15:28] <deadmund> daftykins: Yes, but I'm doing it over USB cause it's  laptop hdd and I have a desktop.  The blocksize on dd is not going to make this go fast enough for me.
[15:28] <note_> llutz, thank you
[15:28] <deadmund> mguy: Ok, I'll try that instead of random (/dev/null right?)
[15:28] <daftykins> deadmund: really? have you run it for 15 mins and seen how far it got using kill -USR1 PID ?
[15:28] <vlaca> deadmund: afaik, hard drives write in blocks of at least 512 bytes so writing a bit takes as much as 512 bytes
[15:29] <note_> hm, it says the password for my user is wrong, but i didn't create a password, what would it be?
[15:29] <mguy> deadmund: Or just drag a bunch of video/mp3 files to it and keep doing it till you fill the disk
[15:29] <daftykins> deadmund: yeah i was meaning use zeroes. dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=2M
[15:29] <NERO_> flowriser, I'm aware. Its the Lenovo battery management for windows. Now how do i stop the charge at 60% in ubuntu?
[15:29] <llutz> note_: i guess you have to configure a password
[15:29] <mguy> NERO_: Why would you want to do that
[15:29] <deadmund> Most recently: 1765 bytes (1.8 kB) copied, 350.191 s   The hdd has 320 billion bytes
[15:29] <SpartanF31> daftykins: i have a normal kubuntu installation, and sometime i need to access the nas over the office network where i work. But at home i want be not visible because if so the wifi owner as happened will shut down the AP.
[15:30] <deadmund> daftykins: ok, i'll try that and see how fast it goes
[15:30] <mguy> deadmund: That's odd it should run at 25MB or so
[15:30] <NERO_> That will help my battery functioning for a long time.
[15:30] <SpartanF31> daftykins: so i need a way to not broadcast my computer name over windows  network.
[15:30] <Pinkamena_D> Hello, can anyone tellme what package i cna use to disable the onboard wireless in favor of a USB one
[15:30] <mguy> NERO_: No it won't, this isn't 1994 batteries and chargers have brains
[15:30] <deadmund> Writing 0's is _much_ faster
[15:30] <deadmund> thanks! :)
[15:31] <Pinkamena_D> the onboard keeps connecting by itself and slowing everything down
=== newbie is now known as Guest97844
[15:31] <NERO_> *as in It will improve the life of my battery.
[15:31] <deadmund> 161480704 bytes (161 MB) copied, 2.98418 s
[15:31] <bekks> deadmund: Why dont you use a reasonable bs= and count= parameter for finding the best performance?
[15:31] <daftykins> deadmund: :)
[15:31] <SpartanF31> mguy: u can use the terminal, and putting down the internal wifi.
[15:31] <mguy> deadmund: USB 3.0?
[15:32] <bekks> deadmund: writing zeros is the same speed as writing random data. GENERATING zeros is much faster than random data.
[15:32] <mguy> quit
[15:32] <FlowRiser> NERO_, oooh, you mean that ... hmm, let me see
[15:32] <kmicu> Crackling, clicking, popping sounds only when I have multimonitor setup (USB X-FI card) :/ Under xfce/gnome/unity the same, and with 12.04 and 12.10
[15:32] <deadmund> bekks: cool, thans
[15:32] <deadmund> mguy: usb2
[15:32] <Pinkamena_D> if you were referring to me, i have tried using the terminal to set wlan0 down with ifconfig, but iwconfig does not seem to have a simmilar feature?
[15:32] <sevenforall> Hm, Ubuntu stops loading during the splash screen with all dots filled. Any ideas?
[15:32] <deadmund> bekks: please, I am.  of course doing that
[15:32] <Pinkamena_D> or is one of the modes you can set it to "disabled"?
[15:32] <daftykins> SpartanF31: just don't start samba when you're at home. simples.
[15:32] <vlaca> bekks: yes, but is generating random data slower than the writing speed of the drive? :_
[15:33] <bekks> vlaca: In some cases, yes.
[15:33] <mguy> deadmund: something might be up - it's impossible for USB 2 to transer 160MB in 2.9 seconds.
[15:33] <Toph2> if you 0 fill your hdd, is it totally, safely erased?
[15:33] <daftykins> SpartanF31: also stop stealing someones wireless network :P
[15:33] <bekks> deadmund: Then whats the complete command you are using?
[15:33] <mguy> Toph2: yes
[15:33] <bekks> Toph2: Yes.
[15:33] <Toph2> ok,, thanks
[15:33] <mguy> vlaca: some random generation is SLOW
[15:33] <vlaca> bekks: maybe /dev/random :)
[15:33] <NERO_> The more times you charge a battery to a 100% and get it down to 15 % or anything near everytime would hamper the life of any battery. So, I have this energy management by lenovo that will charge up the battery for a 60% and run on AC power.
[15:33] <bekks> vlaca: Which is slower than /dev/zero
[15:33] <deadmund> bekks: still figuring that out silly!
[15:33] <bekks> deadmund: Then whats the hdd cache size of your hdd?
[15:34] <mguy> NERO_: That's baloney
[15:34] <vlaca> bekks: yes, it definitely is, but is still might be faster than the drive's speed
[15:34] <SpartanF31> daftykins: ahhaah, it's public, opened.
[15:34] <deadmund> mguy: It's slowed down, now it's at like 29MB / s
[15:34] <daftykins> SpartanF31: doesn't make it right.
[15:34] <Sister> hi. after updating ubuntu 12.04 (not distro change, just regular update over a fresh install) the sound stopped working. my keyboard has a "mute key" that i press and ubuntu says the mute/unmute works, but the keyboard key keeps with the red light on as if it were always deactivated. and despite ubuntu saying it has unmuted, there's still no sound
[15:34] <denebeim> sevenforall: hit F10 while booting and watch what's happening.  There's like a thousand programs that get run when you're seeing 'dots'
[15:34] <bekks> vlaca: It might be faster, but not necessarilly.
[15:34] <mguy> deadmund: that's more like it
[15:34] <bekks> deadmund: And now please give us the command you are running.
[15:34] <FlowRiser> NERO_, gnome-power-preferences, have you looked at it ?
[15:35] <deadmund> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc1 bs=8M    and it's getting about 30MB/s
[15:35] <NERO_> mguy, I'm not trying to be a cynic or waste someone's time around here by creating an illusion or a hoax. What I mentioned about the battery is logical and sound.
[15:35] <SpartanF31> daftykins: i know, i'm sorry. But, my houselord doesn't want activate a flat, and the mobile 3g signal is very bad.
[15:35] <sevenforall> denebeim: I figured the latter. Let me see.
[15:35] <bekks> deadmund: And whats the hdd cache size of your disk?
[15:35] <alex_> FlowRiser: I installed it before (it was the one that comes with the pc)
[15:35] <bekks> deadmund: And where is the count= parameter I told you to use several times now?
[15:35] <Pinkamena_D> does anyone know how to do this? im in the place of public wifi now and still having the problem
[15:36] <NERO_> mguy, I'm not trying to be a cynic or waste someone's time around here by creating an illusion or a hoax. What I mentioned about the battery is logical and sound.
[15:36] <vlaca> bekks: well I'll be damned... on my setup /dev/urandom comes at 14MB/s
[15:36] <vlaca> deadmund: use /dev/zero
[15:36] <NERO_> Flowriser, they dont make any impact.
[15:36] <bekks> vlaca: :P
[15:36] <sevenforall> dennenboom: It stops at 'Checking battery state'
[15:36] <deadmund> bekks: I'm getting around to it!
[15:36] <deadmund> bekks: gosh
[15:36] <sevenforall> denebeim ^
[15:36] <SpartanF31> daftykins: however, stopping the samba server means i couldn't see other pc connected. Is it true'
[15:36] <bekks> deadmund: Did you look it up at the manufacturers site?
[15:37] <deadmund> bekks: I didn't look up the cache size, i'm just empirically determining it
[15:37] <bekks> deadmund: Well, then I am out of your ticket, good luck.
[15:37] <Pinkamena_D> how about just uninstalling an interface? how can i do that?
[15:37] <daftykins> SpartanF31: you don't need to be sharing to connect to shares. i'm not sure if it stops it
[15:38] <NERO_> I've read the ubuntu forums and questions regarding the same from askubuntu.com, but they do not highlight any answers regarding lenovo G580 battery issues. Its more of the thinkpad genre there.
[15:38] <SpartanF31> hmmm
[15:38] <deadmund> sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdc1 bs=16M count=3G   is a little faster at 31MB/s
[15:38] <deadmund> bekks: Thanks for the help :)
[15:38] <daftykins> Pinkamena_D: you still use 'ifconfig <interface> down' if it's a wifi interface
[15:38] <Tex_Nick> NERO_ : i just entered channel ... saw your post about charging battery to 100% ... harms battery ... what type of battery are you refering to and how are you charging it ... older batteries had memory retention problems ... most newer batteries don't suffer from that :)
[15:38] <SpartanF31> ok, thanks... soon i'll try something.
[15:38] <Pinkamena_D> then if just comes back up in 10 seconds
[15:39] <NERO_> Tex_Nick If I may ask, to what memory retention were you implying?
[15:39] <denebeim> sevenforall: at the grub prompt edit the load line and put 'single' at the end
[15:39] <Pinkamena_D> because the management software i assume
[15:39] <note_> llutz, didn't work :/ it logs me in but it can't send it out
[15:39] <note_> or receive
[15:39] <sevenforall> denebeim: Holding shift, right?
[15:39] <NERO_> http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_prolong_lithium_based_batteries
[15:40] <denebeim> sevenforall: that stops the boot really early on.  then poke around /etc/init.d to find where it's checking for the battery
[15:40] <denebeim> severnforall: I usually hit esc or the arrow keys when the boot menu comes up
[15:41] <FlowRiser> NERO_, you can make yourself a script, that will notify you when the battery reaches 60%, then just unpluc the ac power
[15:41] <FlowRiser> NERO_, if you are using Ubuntu 12.04, it
[15:41] <sevenforall> denebeim: Btw, I can get into a console while it's stuck booting, can I continue from there?
[15:41] <Tex_Nick> NERO_ : in particular most older NiCad batteries needed to be drained to about 5% or so before recharging ... if not they would not fully recharge ... that's OLD technology ... the rumor still exists though
[15:41] <FlowRiser> NERO_, it will be fairly simple ... using notify-send
[15:41] <Pinkamena_D> ok, here is a better question. how do i turn off the wireless management software if i canno control it the way i want
[15:42] <Tex_Nick> NERO_ : was just wondering what issues you were having :)
[15:43] <NERO_> FlowRiser The whole point of my question is to have the adapter plugged as long as I'm using the laptop.
[15:43] <denebeim> sevenforall: Oh really?  That's bizarre, I've never seen anything like that.  ssh into the machine sometimes, sure, but not that.
[15:43] <sevenforall> denebeim: I'm absolutely clueless of where to look in init.d
[15:43] <Pinkamena_D> i am a noob but i didnt think this would be [i]that[/i] complicated...
[15:44] <Sister> oh wait. the mute key light goes on only if the headphones are connected
[15:44] <FlowRiser> NERO_, do you have a key combo (fn+f12 or smthng) that does that ?
[15:44] <sevenforall> I don't know if anyone can SSH into my machine and have a look
[15:44] <denebeim> sevenforall: those are the scripts that are run during initialization, I'd grep around for like 'battery' and so on to try to find which script is hanging.
[15:44] <countley> someone help me im about to blow my brains out i cant get my new acer v3-531 wireless drivers to work on backtrack 5 r3 im about to mash the laptop on the floor help!!!!!!
[15:44] <NERO_> Tex-Nick See, I's on windows earlier. there's this batterymanagement software by lenovo that charges the laptop until 60% and post charge, the laptop runs on AC power.
[15:45] <FlowRiser> countley, smash it! :P
[15:45] <sevenforall> I can't find a script that looks battery related, hmmm.
[15:45] <denebeim> anyway, I'm not having any luck getting my own questions answered, so I'm going to try some other irc server.  thanks guys
[15:45] <sevenforall> I don't even know what it's about, it's a bloody desktop, not a laptop.
[15:46] <NERO_> FlowRiser that function is a FFWD action on my keyboard if I'm playing any audio or video.
[15:46] <FlowRiser> NERO_, what kernel do you have ?
[15:46] <vifanq> is wine actually usefull these days ?
[15:46] <FlowRiser> NERO_, type uname -r in the console
[15:46] <Pinkamena_D> countley, their is a backtrack channe;
[15:47] <countley> ok ill check it out thank Pinkamena_D
[15:47] <countley> thanks*
[15:48] <denebeim> sevenforall: well your linux seems to think there's a battery there.  or rather the hardware is hanging looking for a battery.  it will probably end up being a BIOS setting that clears your problem.
[15:48] <sevenforall> Well, I'd be surprised, I didn't alter the UEFI and I'm pretty certain there's not much to change in there related to batteries.
[15:49] <sevenforall> UEFI knows it's not a laptop.
[15:49] <NERO_> I'm on Linux
[15:51] <note_> llutz, you there?
[15:52] <NERO_> anyone?
[15:53] <sevenforall> denebeim: Fixed the issue. Apparently I made a typo in xorg.conf
[15:53] <Toph2> NERO_,,, just pose your question
[15:54] <denebeim> sevenforall: Ah, yeah, there's a battery monitor app that gets run when gnome starts.  I'm kinda surprised it was running before the login screen
[15:55] <NERO_> Toph2 One moment! I'm retrieving the sentences.

[16:01] <Sister> hi. i'm still having this problem after an update. ubuntu mutes sound when headphones are connected
[16:01] <Sister> already tried changing levels on alsamixer
[16:01] <Sister> unplug = sounds work normally. plug = immediate mute.
[16:04] <OerHeks> Sister, does the headphone mute also, because muting the speakers sounds normal
[16:04] <daftykins> Sister: http://superuser.com/questions/431079/how-to-disable-auto-mute-mode
=== Mi-- is now known as Mi`
[16:04] <Sister> yes, mutes everything. even the "mute key" on the keyboard lights up, as i had pressed it. pressing it again makes no difference
[16:05] <Sister> i see no automute option on alsamixer, daftykins
[16:06] <daftykins> no idea then
[16:06] <note_> 	 Is it possible to use postfix and add an email to a mail client such as Mail app on Mac or 'Mail' on iPhone to send/receive emails through my vps ?
[16:06] <daftykins> note_: yes if your VPS has a domain with MX records pointing to it so it can handle email
[16:08] <note_> daftykins, i have set up postfix and cyrus and can send email to someone with root@domain.tld within ssh in terminal
[16:08] <note_> but i can't seem to add it to my client, where would i set up mx records, namecheap?
[16:09] <daftykins> note_: sounds more like you need to look up a guide on how to enable IMAP/POP access
[16:09] <note_> i see

[16:11] <Tex_Nick> Sister : only thing that i can think of is that the heahphones aren't working ... as OerHeks pointed out " muting speakers is normal" ... a bad headphone cable could lead to your conclusion ... can you try other headphones
[16:11] <Sister> it works on windows 7, Tex_Nick
=== xubuntu is now known as Guest54244
[16:12] <nizor> Hey
[16:12] <Sister> Tex_Nick, with alsamixer open, i see exactly the moment when i plug in the headphones, the "speaker 1" goes to zero  (there's speaker 1 and 2 instead of headphones and speaker)
[16:13] <xubuntu_> hi
[16:14] <nizor> i need someone to help me with the ubuntu 12.04....i'm downloading it now
[16:14] <novusordo> daftykins: thanks
[16:14] <ThinkT510> nizor: you'd need to be more specific
[16:14] <daftykins> np!
[16:15] <Tex_Nick> Sister : ok, just thought i'd offer that ... i don't know what thee issue is ... keep asking, someone will probably be able to help :)
[16:15] <Sister> yep, thanks :)
[16:16] <xubuntu_> Sister, what happens when you increase the volume level?
[16:17] <NERO_> Top2
[16:17] <Sister> it goes up like it had changed, but headphones are still mute. also, i'd like to note that i i have "speaker 1  /  speaker 2"  instead of  "headphone / speaker" bars. and only speaker 1 makes a difference (in the speakers, not the headphones). changing speaker 2 doesn't change anything
[16:17] <NERO_> Toph2
[16:19] <Sister> wait, alsamixergui has more options
[16:19] <Sister> and it shows a mute key over each bar
[16:19] <qengho> I have a sdcard I need to write a disk image to, so I can boot on some other hardware. "dd" hangs.  "dd if=... of=/dev/disk/by-id/foo-disk-not-a-partition bs=4M" as root.  It gets a little into it, and then nothing.  "strace" sees both open()s, then 20 something read()/write() syscalls, then silence.
[16:19] <media-centre> hey can anyone help withubuntu
[16:19] <qengho> Any idea?
[16:19] <NERO_> Countley
[16:20] <NERO_> Countley respond.
[16:20] <media-centre> i cant seemm to play my dvd video on vlc or anything
[16:20] <nizor> media-centre be more specific
[16:20] <xubuntu_> Sister, did you intall any new multimedia codecs or something lately?
[16:20] <NERO_> media-centre what do u mean by that?
[16:21] <media-centre> well i stick in my dvd and open vlc and then i click play on the button after loading it
[16:21] <media-centre> and then it doess nothing
[16:21] <media-centre> not even a error message
[16:21] <Sister> i only updated, xubuntu_ .  now i see that i can unmute the headphones in alsamixergui since it has a mute/unmute button for each bar  instead of only the option to higher/lower volume like in alsamixer. clicking that makes the headphones work properly. but when i unplug/plug it goes back to mute. now i'm searching for a way to save the setting so i don't have to manually fix it every single time
[16:21] <xubuntu_> media-centre, !dvd
[16:22] <Sister> no idea why ubuntu did this. the sound was working perfectly -_-
[16:22] <xubuntu_> are you using pulse audio?
[16:22] <Tex_Nick> Sister : Yeahhhhhhhhhh ... that's a start ... good for you :)
[16:22] <xubuntu_> Sister, PAC?
[16:23] <Sister> it says pulseaudio is running, xubuntu_ , but i have no access to anything related to it, i think. just alsamixer and the sound options
[16:23] <folorn> hmm
[16:23] <ioria> media-centre: did you install css ?
[16:23] <media-centre> hallo
[16:23] <Sister> yep, Tex_Nick . at least i can listen to music, though it's ridiculous to have to go there press buttons every single time ._.
[16:24] <xubuntu_> Sister, open pulse audio control and see the audio output settings
[16:24] <media-centre> ok ill givee that a try
[16:24] <Sister> erm.. where is it or what is the terminal command, xubuntu_ ?  -_-
[16:24] <Sister> "pulseaudio" on terminal only says "daemon already running"
[16:25] <Sgt_Shultz> VLC
[16:25] <media-centre> wwhts the package called
[16:26] <xubuntu_> sister you can find it any tool like application earch
[16:26] <xubuntu_> search*
[16:26] <Sister> nope. nothing related to pulseaudio in the application search
[16:27] <ioria> media-centre: lbdvdnav - libdvdcss2  etc... etc ...
[16:27] <xubuntu_> Sister, if the daemon i running ..it must be there...
[16:27] <OerHeks> media-centre, follow this part https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/PlayingDVDs  libdvdread4 and install-css.sh
[16:27] <OerHeks> media-centre, restart VLC after that
[16:28] <Sgt_Shultz> Install VlC, Sister, LOOK IN Ubuntu Software Center/Multimedia
[16:28] <Sister> i have vlc
[16:29] <Sgt_Shultz> VLC should play ALL updated...
[16:29] <Sister> the volume meter for pulseaudio is not installed if that's what you mean, xubuntu_
[16:30] <xubuntu_> oh ok
[16:30] <folorn> so any ideas how to get a new distro to run ? it came with a loader etc the works but just wont boot from the CD- ive got a hp labtop quite new so what gives if someone could help that would be great.
[16:30] <media-centre> restricted extras
[16:30] <media-centre> yea i got that package
[16:30] <Sister> installed it, same thing as alsamixergui, xubuntu_ . when i unplug/plug the headphones, the tab changes output to "headphones" and it's mute. if i change it to "speakers"  (with headphones connected) the headphones come back to life
[16:30] <media-centre> im running ubuntu 12.04
[16:30] <Sister> alas, who knows what the hell that update did
[16:31] <xubuntu_> Sister, install it from software centre and hopefully  your issue would be resolved
[16:31] <Sgt_Shultz> Sister,  look in log
[16:31] <Sister> i already did, xubuntu_ . as i said, it's the same behavior as alsamixergui
[16:32] <Sister> what, Sgt_Shultz ?
[16:32] <rainbowwarrior> hi, i am running Ubuntu 12.10 and I have some Sennheiser pc 8 headphones, my problem is I am no longer getting sound threw the headphones, how can i check to see if its detecting them and also fix the problem please ?
[16:32] <rainbowwarrior> as it was working before and now they aint :(
[16:33] <Sgt_Shultz> Sister, in Ubuntu Software Center, HISTORY
[16:34] <Sister> ah, to see what the update did, Sgt_Shultz ?  it installed new headers, it seems
[16:34] <Sister> new headers, some stuff for pidgin and something called libgtkspell0 and that's all.
[16:35] <folorn> nobody has any ideas ?
[16:35] <Sgt_Shultz> Sister,  hehe, life is fun isn't it
[16:35] <media-centre> ok thanx for that
[16:35] <Sister> and on the day before it updated pulseaudio too
[16:35] <Sister> alas!
[16:35]  * rainbowwarrior slaps Ubuntu
[16:35] <Sgt_Shultz> VLC
[16:35] <xubuntu_> Sister, pulse audio
[16:35] <denebeim> You know rainbowwarrior throwing things around just because they don't work doesn't help
[16:36] <rainbowwarrior> lol
[16:36] <xubuntu_> maybe problem lies there
[16:36] <Sister> always pulseaudio
[16:36] <vlaca> rainbowwarrior: does it at least show up in dmesg?
[16:36] <NERO_> sister
[16:36] <xubuntu_> lol yeah
[16:36] <Sister> how do i shot web, xubuntu_ ? or rather, how do i kill it forever?
[16:36] <denebeim> Oh and you're missing a ',' after 'threw'
[16:36] <NERO_> what is the issue?
[16:37] <alami> what does that mean http://pastebin.com/KR5Nktuj
[16:37] <ioria> folorn: your bios options are ok ?
[16:37] <alami> problem with libstdc++???
[16:37] <BluesKaj> the pulseaudio GUI , pavucontrol, might help with output and volume settings , Sister
[16:37] <Sister> have all those, BlueEagle . as i said, i can fix it, but it doesn't stay fixed if i unplug and re-plug
[16:38] <folorn> so dunno what to do ioria
[16:38] <Sister> the worst part is that this is like the icing in the cake, as ubuntu already does not work with the hybrid card i currently have, being to use anything other than ubuntu 2d. so it's a shitstorm of utter annoyance
[16:38] <t7> after installing xmonad tty7 is allways blank after boot, i have to goto tty1 and work from there, why is this?
[16:39] <BluesKaj> Sister, hybrid card ?
[16:39] <siavoshkc> hey
[16:39] <siavoshkc> whats a hybrid card?
[16:39] <rainbowwarrior> vlaca, the only one i see in dmesg is some Nvida headphones, but these are Sennheiser headphones
[16:39] <Sister> BlueEagle, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1930450&page=62
[16:39] <siavoshkc> a graphic card?
[16:39] <xubuntu_> Sister, i would ask to reinstall pulse audio
[16:39] <Sister> hmn okay
[16:40] <BluesKaj> Sister, it's BluesKaj
[16:40] <Sister> sorry, tab and autocomplete, ya know  :|
[16:40] <BluesKaj> the other blue becomes annoyed if this keeps up
[16:40] <vlaca> rainbowwarrior: try to unplug/plug and see if you get new entries in dmesg about Nvidia headphones... it might be some mis-detection
[16:40] <Sister> yes
[16:40] <folorn> could i run the cd through virtual box or something maybe?
[16:41] <rainbowwarrior> vlaca  , nope no new entries
[16:41] <noobvv> when i hide booting screen with 'esc' i dont see anything... i want see booting process, so i can see what errors i get. how to do that ?
[16:42] <Tex_Nick> Sister have you tried ... in terminal ... ubuntu-bug audio
[16:42] <vlaca> rainbowwarrior: what does lsusb tell you?
[16:42] <BluesKaj> which sound card Sister ? The one in the post is a hybrid graphics card
[16:43] <Sister> you asked about what i was talking about with hybrid cards, that was the complaint, it's unrelated to the audio issue i came talk about. sorry for the confusion! :)
[16:43] <ioria> folorn: you have to enter the bios ... in a way or in another
[16:43] <folorn> i agree ioria..
[16:43] <ioria> folorn: esc - canc - f1 don't work ?
[16:44] <rainbowwarrior> vlaca , http://paste.ubuntu.com/1552630/
[16:44] <folorn> well like F2 brings me into the bios menu but i looked around and couldn't find the damn bios option for boot sequence.. im very new to Hp's so dunno what to do really.
[16:45] <xubuntu_> Sister, i think the problem is with just settings of pulse audio write in terminal "pavucontrol" and check the input and output devices settings....
[16:45] <Sgt_Shultz> folorn, I run Xubuntu on a HP D^, even got fingerprint scanner working with google search
[16:45] <rainbowwarrior> hmm looks like it is not detecting the headphones anymore :s
[16:45] <Sgt_Shultz> folivora, DV6
[16:45] <ioria> folorn: there you are... good
[16:45] <vlaca> rainbowwarrior: yeah... have you tried different usb ports?
[16:46] <ioria> folorn: look for boot options and sub-menus
[16:46] <Sister> ok, xubuntu_ . maybe i wasn't clear. with pavucontrol running (the graphical thing), headphones unplugged. sound plays normally.  i plug headphones, the "output" drop menu goes from "speakers" to "headphones" and everything mutes. if i manually click the drop menu and select speakers (with the headphones plugged), the headphones work perfectly. the issue is having to do this manually every time i unplug and plug headphones
[16:47] <rainbowwarrior> yes, don't seem to matter what usb port I use, its not detecting them , let me try my headphones on another laptop to check my headphones are not broke :O
[16:47] <folorn> basically the issue Sgt_shultz is ive got a new BT 5 live cd i wanna play with but it wont run at start up and dunno how to make it do that ..ive looked for the boot sequence but dont know HP's very well so might have missed something.
[16:48] <Sgt_Shultz> folorn, checking
[16:48] <vlaca> rainbowwarrior: good idea
[16:49] <folorn> thanks alot sgt_shultz
[16:49] <ioria> folorn: don't panic ... and keep searching .... the option is there...
[16:49] <klync> can anyone tell me how my particular model of dvdrw would have been written into /etc/udev/rules.d/ ? This must've been done by a script that scanned my hw at one point; I'd like to regenerate it
[16:49] <Sgt_Shultz> folorn, ESC
[16:49] <kunji> folorn: So for BIOS try all of f1, f2, f10, f11, f12, and del, will probably need a few boots to get the right one, and you might end up in something else before that (like the boot menu for choosing what to boot from just this time).
[16:50] <xubuntu_> Sister, whats the profile in configuration tab?
[16:50] <Tex_Nick> Sister : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1585047 discusses your problem ... no solution on that link, however it does give related information
[16:50] <folorn> ahh k... thanks alot guys
[16:50] <folorn> :)
[16:50] <folorn> i owe ya
[16:50] <Sister> analog stereo duplex, xubuntu_
[16:50] <Sgt_Shultz> enjoy Ubuntu
[16:51] <ioria> folorn: yippi ya ye
[16:51] <kunji> Tex_Nick: turns out it wasn't flash, IRC was just keeping the computer awake, I had the same issue after rebooting with no flash running (The screen turning off and one core going to 100% problem).
[16:52] <rainbowwarrior> darn it
[16:52] <rainbowwarrior> vlaca , looks like my headphones are broke ty for your help
[16:53] <vlaca> rainbowwarrior: np, that's too bad though :(
[16:53] <Sister> lol rainbowwarrior
[16:53] <Sister> that's tragic
[16:53] <rainbowwarrior> I know, have not even had them that long :s :(
[16:53] <Sister> yep. and stressing over trying to fix what can't be fixed XD
[16:54] <Tex_Nick> kunji : hey goodto see you ... and thanks for the post ... that one had me troubled, as it was a similarf problem for me:-)
[16:54] <ronnie> i have backedup my ubuntu 12.10 by remastersys.but i am finding the backup file. where the backup saved.pls tell me the location.
[16:54] <xubuntu_> Sister, i guess you reinstall pulseaudio it would automatically fall back to default settings
[16:54] <rainbowwarrior> hehe yeah but its fun to take things apart sometimes and see what is wrong :D
[16:54] <kunji> Tex_Nick: It might be possible it's a screensaver: http://askubuntu.com/questions/216783/ubuntu-12-10-turn-screen-off-when-inactive-for-never-still-turns-off
[16:54] <Sgt_Shultz> electronic crosswords puzzles ....
[16:55] <Sister> do i have to uninstall it or is there a reinstall command, xubuntu_ ?
[16:55] <xubuntu_> go to software centre uninstall and reinstall
[16:55] <vlaca> klync: have you tried deleting the current rules file for your cd and rebooting? it should regenerate it
[16:56] <BluesKaj> ronnie, remastersys ? ..never heard of it
[16:56] <xubuntu_> or from package manager just reinstall
[16:56] <Sister> ah okay, i thought there should be a reinstall button somewhere that i wasn't seeing, xubuntu_ . thanks XD
[16:56] <vlaca> klync: also, see /lib/udev/rules.d/75-cd-aliases-generator.rules file
[16:56] <xubuntu_> hehe
[16:56] <kunji> Tex_Nick: Also that would explain the cpu use, it probably just keeps rendering the blank screen as often as it can.
[16:57] <vlaca> klync: seems a write_cd_rules script is generating the rules file
=== tensorpuddin is now known as tensorpudding
[16:57] <BluesKaj> Sister, have you checked alsamixer in the terminal , there may be an option/setting for your headphone out
[16:57] <Tex_Nick> Sister : don't know what distro or hardware you're running ... but an identical issue on Gentoo was solved here ... http://forums.gentoo.org/viewtopic-t-885736-start-0.html

[17:01] <noobvv>  Im getting DRDY ERROR, after that im dropped to busybox, what to do ?
[17:01] <Sister> alas, at least there is a way of making it work
[17:01] <Sister> it's one of those bizarre voodoo issues that has no reason to exist.
[17:01] <Sister> thanks for the help everyone!
[17:02] <xubuntu_> Sister, :(
[17:02] <Tex_Nick> kunji : agreed ... i've monitoring my cpu usage more often since we had that discussion ... seems that my cpu usage is not quite as symetrical as i stated the other day ... ffmped transcoding does some funny things ... it switches between cores while transcoding the sane file ... each core goes to 100% for a bit ... then another is used
[17:02] <note_> Hello, I have set up Postfix and Cyrus on my Ubuntu 12.10 server, I can send email's within the terminal window, however they appear as root@domain.tld
[17:02] <note_> Is it possible to be able to have it so for example, my email would be note@domain.tld and I can send and receive emails within an email client?
[17:03] <Sister> but xubuntu_ , it's reason to smile! it can always be worse. it could, i don't know, have exploded and caught fire in the bedroom and then the house and then in all the connected apartments and 20 people could have died
[17:03] <Sister> all i have to do is click a drop menu, certainly not tragic  :|

[17:04] <folorn> brb im gonna try the boot menu again thanks all for your help
[17:04] <note_> llutz, that makes no sense to me, i'm new to ubuntu :\
[17:04] <xubuntu_> anyhow
[17:04] <xubuntu_> bye
[17:05] <Sister> xubuntu_, and that's not to even go in the effing impossible graphic issues i'm having because of the hybrid card
[17:05] <llutz> note_: setting up a mailserver isn't a trivial thing, you have to learn it...  check http://www.postfix.org/ADDRESS_REWRITING_README.html#canonical
[17:05] <Sister> but alas, i have faith in linux. maybe not so much in ubuntu anymore
[17:05] <xubuntu_> Sister, haha ...thats sad:(
[17:05] <Sister> when i'm back in homeland and with time, i'll migrate to debian maybe. but for now, ubuntu it is :D
[17:06] <Sister> thanks again for the patience, xubuntu_
[17:06] <BluesKaj> sis  after Tex_Nick 's suggestion you have to reboot to make the addition in /etc/modprobe.d/alsa.conf  stick

[17:06] <Sister> damn
[17:06] <Sister> BluesKaj!
[17:07]  * Sister has been blinking the poor unrelated blue for eons now
[17:07] <Kraghot_> I need some help with my ubuntu: Today I installed a fresh copy of ubuntu and when it all updated and the computer restarted only the background image appeared along with the icons.. There is not Unity (I hope I'm using the term right)
[17:07] <BluesKaj> hehe , ok Sister .. good luck ..I have to go push some snow , one of the lovely things we hewre in the great white north in winter :)
[17:07] <llutz> note_:err, this is the one http://www.postfix.org/ADDRESS_REWRITING_README.html#generic
[17:08] <Sister> good luck and have fun, BluesKaj !
[17:09] <llutz> note_: create a file /etc/postfix/generic, add a line "root@domain.tld  itsme@myowndomain.tld"    (replace to fit your wishes)
[17:09] <Kraghot_> anyone? any idea how I might try to restart it and/or reset it?
[17:10] <note_> llutz, and what would that allow me to do?
[17:10] <llutz> note_: then "sudo postmap /etc/postfix/generic"
[17:10] <llutz> note_: you want your email-addresses rewritten, this is one way
[17:11] <note_> I want to be able to add my email address to a client
[17:11] <rubiconjosh> Krahot_: You should restart and see if that fixes it
[17:11] <Sgt_Shultz> Kraghot,  , Can u reboot from live CD ?
[17:12] <noobvv> i live with myh mom
[17:12] <llutz> note_: yes, and? you need to create a user in cyrus, setup saslauth in postfix, then you configure your mailclient
[17:12] <rubiconjosh> Kraghot_: If you are unsure how to reboot hit ctrl+alt+t to open a terminal then sudo shutdown -r now
[17:12] <Kraghot_> solved it just had to do unity --reset
[17:12] <rubiconjosh> Nice
[17:12] <Kraghot_> :D
[17:12] <Kraghot_> let's see if it works after a reboot now
[17:12] <note_> llutz, the only problem i'm having is that my mail client does not know/cannot find an incoming and outgoing mail server
[17:13] <note_> i have put in the IP of my server, it allows me to add it to my client
[17:13] <Sgt_Shultz> Patience ...
[17:13] <note_> but it doesn't receive or send emails
[17:13] <llutz> note_: your question sounded more that you wanted to rewrite root@foo into note@foo
[17:13] <llutz> note_: have you configured your postfix/cyrus to listen to the public-IP?
[17:14] <note_> I followed a tutorial on postfix/cyrus, i'm not quite sure what i've done, like i said, I'm new to all of this o_o

[17:50] <Sister> yes. changing that line in alsa-base.conf and rebooting solved it, Tex_Nick . reboot was needed
[17:51] <BluesKaj> e66 , if it's a working mirror , it's easier to add in /etc/apt/sources.list and then sudp apt-get update in the terminal
[17:51] <MonkeyDust> morfo_81  i guess the people in #bash know best
[17:51] <BluesKaj> e66, sudo apt-get update
[17:52] <e66> BluesKaj:  I dont want to add it in sources.list. I want to add it so I can select the server in synattic
[17:52] <Transfusion> synaptic is a front-end for apt..?
[17:53] <morfo_81> MonkeyDust, thanks!
[17:53] <BluesKaj> e66, synaptic and apt both use the dpkg system , so where you add the mirror doesn't matter ,... both use the dpkg base

[17:56] <Rallias> ActionParsnip, That's what I'm trying to avoid.
[17:56] <e66> I think it can be done using mirrors protocol
[17:57] <ActionParsnip> Rallias: why? It's more secure than a web interface?
[17:57] <ActionParsnip> Rallias: fatrat has a web ui you can perform http and ftp downloads with
[17:58] <ActionParsnip> Rallias you will need an x server and need to enable the web ui as its not enabled by default
[17:58] <BluesKaj> Tex_Nick, Sister in some cases manual entries into asla-base.conf don't work.  It's still a mystery to me whynot.

[18:35] <itry> usr13: hmm... its not really about the problem what to do when grub has been killed. more about the general topic of encryption. if grub had some sophisticated config and that is now gone, im probably f..<profanity>..ed

[18:49] <itry> So it looks like I lost my good old debian partition because ubuntu somehow destroyed it :(
[18:49] <bekks> because the user did something wrong, apparently.
[18:50] <ThinkT510> itry: what does gparted show?
[18:51] <Tex_Nick> itry : tis unlikely that ubuntu would destroy a partition with out being instructed to do so
[18:51] <BluesKaj> always use manual partitioning when dual booting..it should be a rule
[18:51] <itry> ThinkT510: a lot of partitions
[18:51] <ThinkT510> itry: thats lovely

[18:52] <sogeking99> Hey guys, if I want to install the new drivers by ATI, which are apparently a huge step up, do I need to remove fglrx first?
[18:52] <BluesKaj> itry, did you do sudo update-grub
[18:52] <sogeking99> Sorry about before I was having crazy connection issues
[18:52] <itry> BluesKaj: one thing i tried was to boot into the debian boot partition and run grub-install /dev/sda
[18:53] <itry> BluesKaj: it changed the appearance of grub but debian still doesnt boot normaly anymore.
[18:53] <BluesKaj> itry, no , in ubuntu
[18:53] <itry> BluesKaj: no
[18:53] <BluesKaj> do it
[18:53] <Tex_Nick> itry : when you say "debian does not boot normaly since i updated ubuntu" what exactly happens
[18:54] <I_broke_amazon> Hi - I uninstalled the amazon ads from 12.10 and now when I click the login button on amazon.com firefox hangs
[18:54] <itry> BluesKaj, ThinkT510, Tex_Nick: Im not sure if you are aware of the details of the problem. So here some info: I have debian set up like this: it boots from a small boot partition, mounts an LVM in an encrypted partition and then starts gnome etc.
[18:54] <biio> I'm having some issues with the 12.10 install on my laptop (using EFI bios), it keeps crashing on the part about installing the bootloader, I ran an error check on the install medium, and it was ok, any ideas?
[18:55] <ThinkT510> !uefi | biio
[18:55] <ubottu> biio: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[18:55] <itry> BluesKaj, ThinkT510, Tex_Nick: Until today, when I updated ubuntu from 5 to 12 on another partition. Now I can still boot into the debian boot partition. But it does not ask me for my password anymore but just stops at a sehll.
[18:55] <BluesKaj> why a boot partition ?
[18:55] <itry> BluesKaj: you need something unencrypted to boot from.
[18:55] <ThinkT510> itry: 5 to 12?
[18:55] <bekks> itry: Which is not true.
[18:55] <sogeking99> ?
[18:55] <BluesKaj> install grub on ubuntu
[18:56] <usr13> itry: Can you do anything from the shell?  Can you bring up the gui?  Like startx or startxfce4 or what-ever, (I don't know what GUI you use so...).
[18:56] <BluesKaj> itry  listen to bekks
[18:56] <itry> ThinkT510: maybe it was not 5. i dont remember. it was a very old partition i havent touched in years.
[18:56] <biio> ThinkT510: I've been trough that, but something just hit me, do I need the EFI partition to be re reformated for the ubuntu install maybe?
[18:56] <itry> usr13: startx without the / partition? i doubt that.. i can try...
[18:57] <ThinkT510> itry: so you mean you fresh installed over it?
[18:57] <itry> ThinkT510: no, i just clicked "yeah, update the distro, whatever" when it asked me. and than it worked for about 90 minutes...
[18:57] <usr13> itry: startblackbox  startkde startfluxbox startvwm2 startxfce4   (Don't know what your using but...)

[19:00] <tbrock> not sure why
[19:00] <sogeking99> okay thanks
[19:00] <itry> Tex_Nick: here is my original question from an hour ago: I have a problem: I have debian 6 in an encrypted partition with a LVM. So I set up a boot partition that sets up the encrypted lvm and boots it. Now I updated Ubuntu on another partition and it looks like it messed up the system somehow. When I boot my boot partition, I end up in a shell, not in Debian. Any ideas how to go about it?
[19:01] <wN> itry: i believe the shell should provide the tools you need to unencrypt manually and mount as /dev/root
[19:01] <wN> is the dracut shell right?
[19:01] <itry> wN: maybe
[19:01] <itry> wN: i dont know which shell it is.
[19:01] <wN> what kind of prompt do you have?
[19:02] <itry> wN: root@mymachine: ~#
[19:02] <itry> wN: and a blinking cursor :)
[19:02] <kunji> itry: Hmm, first can you give us your disk layout.  Results of sudo fdisk -l
[19:02] <usr13> itry: fdisk -l && mount #See what partitions you are using.
[19:02] <wN> i usually see that behavior if the initramfs is unable to see the root disk.. which would happen if you're having some unencryption failure
[19:02] <ioria> itry: and lsblk
[19:02] <kunji> itry: Or yeah, you're root, so do what usr13 and ioria said
[19:03] <wN> also, if this happened after an update, perhaps you can just boot into the previous kernel and it'll bring the system up
[19:03] <ipv6herm1t> hey guys, I'm running 12.04 and and I updated my laptop last night.  the updates included nvidia driver, kernel, pulse audio... I just knew something was gonna break... I got the graphics working... but now the audio is not working.  the mixer runs and the volume is all the way up but no sound on my laptop :(
[19:03] <itry> kunji: why? there are my debian boot partition, the encrypted debian partition, the ubuntu partition and some other partitions of mine.
[19:03] <usr13> itry: ... and tell us which partition(s) your Debian install is on.
[19:04] <itry> wN: well, I CAN boot into the debian boot partition. but what shall i do there? or is that not what you mean?
[19:05] <itry> usr13: debian has a boot partition in an extended partition and an encrypted lvm in an extended partition.
[19:05] <kunji> itry: Oh, so you're saying that you can get to the debian boot, but you're not being prompted for your password?  Or it's giving you a rescue shell?
[19:06] <jonascj> Is it possible to detect/find out what application/software/daemon captures a given keystroke? (I am desperately trying to learn what deals with my media keys / laptop specific keys - brightness, volume etc.)
[19:06] <usr13> itry: I don't think that any of us know how to fix what you have and one of the fundamental reasons is that we do not know what you have.  If you can pastebin some specific information about your filesystem(s), maybe we can help.
[19:06] <kunji> itry: If you're not having boot problems is the partition stuff even relevant?
[19:06] <itry> kunji: yes, i can boot into the debian boot, but im not prompted for a password.
[19:06] <kunji> itry: And it automatically makes you root?  Or did you login like that after boot?
[19:07] <usr13> itry: Is this a console session, or is it just grub?
[19:07] <itry> kunji: it gives me a login prompt. so i logged in as root.
[19:07] <islan> hey, can someone help me with this bluetooth problem I am having?
[19:07] <itry> usr13: looks like a normal shell to me.
[19:07] <k1l_> jonascj: xev
[19:08] <usr13> itry: How can you be logged in if you do not give a username or password?
[19:08] <islan> I've finally run out of ideas
[19:08] <kunji> itry: So you did log in fine... so your problem is just that it didn't start your GUI?
[19:08] <ioria> itry: exit and try if you can login as user
[19:08] <jonascj> k1l_: xev only captures keystrokes - what I need is to find out what other software captures those key strokes
[19:08] <k1l_> jonascj: ok, i dont know that
[19:09] <Tex_Nick> !details | islan
[19:09] <ubottu> islan: Please give us full details. For example: "I have a problem with ..., I'm running Ubuntu version .... When I try to do ..., I get the following output: ..., but I expected it to do ..."
[19:09] <itry> kunji: well, it also didnt decrypt my partitions inside the encrypted lvm.
[19:09] <islan> okay, let here it goes:
[19:09] <jonascj> k1l_: but thank you for your input
[19:09] <I_broke_amazon> how do I reinstall the amazon ads to see if that fixes the problem?
[19:09] <itry> kunji: what i find really strange is that when i type "cryptsetup" it tells me it doesnt know that command.
[19:09] <k1l_> I_broke_amazon: how did you uninstall it?
[19:10] <kunji> itry: does it know say fdisk, or nano?  Maybe you did end up someplace else...
[19:10] <I_broke_amazon> sudo apt-get remove unity-lens-shopping
[19:11] <itry> kunji: fdisk works. nano works. vi works.
[19:11] <islan> I am trying to connect my wii remote to my 12.10 laptop.  I have downloaded wmgui and its associated files.  When I tried to connect, it did not detect anything (I held down the 1+2 buttons as well as the Sync button).  hcitool dev returns hci0 and its MAC address. when I run hcitool scan, it still doesn't detect anything.  I made my bluetooth device discoverable, and my wife scanned on her nexus 7 but could not discover my laptop.
[19:11] <kunji> itry: If you're logged in though, shouldn't that be on the partition that encrypted, so shouldn't it be decrypting?
[19:11] <kunji> itry: Unless you're logged onto the Ubuntu partition?
[19:12] <islan> I also could not discover my wife's nexus 7 (or anything for that matter)
[19:12] <k1l_> I_broke_amazon: that shouldnt relate to an firefox problem
[19:12] <I_broke_amazon> I wouldn't think so, but it was working fine until I did that
[19:12] <I_broke_amazon> rebooted and suddenly I can't log into amazon anymore - that was the only change I made
[19:13] <itry> kunji: im logged into the boot partition. which is always unencrypted.
[19:13] <itry> I think i might have a way of rescuing the machine like this: Boot from a debian CD, set up an encrpypted install but then stop after the partitioning.
[19:14] <Tex_Nick> islan : see if this helps ...
[19:14] <kunji> itry: Oh, ... huh, logged into the boot partition.  Umm, but don't you need the data on your encrypted partition?

[19:17] <itry> kunji: i switched to user for fun. but its still only a shell.
[19:17] <islan> Tex_Nick, thanks, but I already have bluez installed.  it seems to just tell me to do more hcitool scan commands

[19:18] <itry> kunji: i dont feel so happy :)
[19:18] <kunji> itry: Mmmk, well, I don't play with encryption, so what do you normally need to decrypt it?  Just the password, or some keyfile?

[19:34] <kunji> itry: Also, just so you know, you should be asking the Debian folks about this, as the problem is occurring on the Debian partition, so even though it possibly happened as a side effect of your Ubuntu installation, the problem isn't actually supported here.

If you mean just a liveCD style one, then it is even more likely to work, should so long as your machine can boot from USB, though some USB drives are finicky.
[19:44] <_TheCoder_> I need it to work on a pc though
[19:44] <kunji> _TheCoder_: ignore that, you can use UNetbootin

[19:45] <kunji> _TheCoder_: That will get you a liveUSB, which you can use to install it on the pc if you want, or you can boot your mac with it and actually install to a usb drive.
[19:46] <_TheCoder_> just fyi the pc does have a HDD
[19:46] <kunji> _TheCoder_: It's it's for creating bootable USB drives from a disk image, you can then use that usb to install to the HD of the pc

[20:02] <kunji> _TheCoder_: You'll want to go into the BIOS on the PC and make sure it's set to boot from USB first.  So then once that creation finishes, you should be able to put in the usb, boot, and it should work.  Some BIOSs are obnoxious and don't work right though, and occasionally a usb drive just doesn't want to be booted from no matter what you do to it.  If it doesn't work the first time don't give up right away though, try reformatting the dri

See which ones let  you cd to it. On top of that create a file with 700 permissions in the directory (/tmp/test-permissions/file.txt with some content) and try to read that file (also with all the permissions)...
[20:06] <jonascj> ...that'll show what works and what does not
[20:06] <kunji> _TheCoder_: A blinking line?  Might still be loading, be a bit patient, for the livecd most of it needs to be loaded into RAM

[20:08] <sirriffsalot> I'm having some trouble booting the 12.10 version of your dist. from a USB-stick.. It works on another computer, but on this one I just don't understand what is wrong. There are many USB-[options] in my boot selection, but none of them are able to pick up the usb-stick except twice where it was a stroke of luck.. No idea what I did right. Any way of trouble shooting this further?
[20:08] <_TheCoder_> I have no hard drives in the pc
[20:08] <islan> sirriffsalot, you might want to try plugging the usb in after hitting the power button on your comp
[20:09] <islan> my motherboard doesn't like detecting it immediately if it is already plugged in
[20:09] <kunji> _TheCoder_: Oh, I thought you said you did, so you want a full install on the USB then, instead of a liveCD style one?
[20:09] <tb___> I'm having an issue where my Ubuntu machine will randomly freeze and I can only recover by rebooting. Is there a log file I can read somewhere to see what happened (i.e. why it froze in the first place)?
[20:09] <robbietjuh> Can anyone help us with some ATI issues...? We've got a Radeon 5650, drivers install correctly but upon reboot it goes into safe graphics mode.. Logs say "no screens found"
[20:09] <sirriffsalot> islan, cheers for replying! I did, and on those two occasions it worked by luck.. I've been at it for an hour now.. Reason I had to do it over again was because my hard disk was not plugged in so I could not install :-/
[20:09] <_TheCoder_> I guess
[20:10] <islan> sirriffsalot, so you've tried turning the PC on, then immediately plugging in the USB and prompting for the boot menu?
[20:10] <kunji> robbietjuh: you might need to fix your xorg.conf, try moving it to xorg.conf.old or something and see if it generates you a good one on next boot.
[20:11] <sirriffsalot> islan, well, not as immediate as immediately.. haha. Is this normally the issue?
[20:11] <kunji> _TheCoder_: Mmmk, well, to use the usb method to install then, you will need 2 usb drives, one to use as the livecd and one to install to
[20:11] <kunji> _TheCoder_: Or a burned liveCD and the usb drive
[20:11] <islan> sirriffsalot, depends on the motherboard, I got a new Gigabyte motherboard recently that behaved that way
[20:11] <robbietjuh> kunji, thanks for your reply. As we remove the file it generates a new one of course, but then the ATI drivers don't work..
[20:11] <_TheCoder_> I have a dual boot cd
[20:11] <sirriffsalot> islan, how do I check the motherboard name with the terminal again..? :)
[20:12] <_TheCoder_> I have no operating system though
[20:12] <kunji> _TheCoder_: The usb drive can be installed to during the installation just like for a hard drive, so just be careful not to pick the hard drive of the computer you're using to do the install (could use your mac).

[20:15] <kunji> _TheCoder_: So the liveUSB should let you boot into Ubuntu, hopefully we can get that to work on the PC, but it's not a full install, installed programs won't survive a reboot,  etc... But it is used to do a full install, but we would need another USB drive to install to.  Now, if we can't get the liveUSB to boot on the PC, you still might be able to do that on the mac and install to another usb and it may boot on the pc.  Alternatively you

[20:17] <robbietjuh> kunji, _TheCode_, unetbootin let's you reserve space on the USB drive so you can install applications and write files, surviving a reboot...
[20:17] <islan> sirriffsalot, so you got a Gigabyte, just like my other PC, which also has that USB boot issue
[20:17] <sirriffsalot> islan, so you had the exact same issue and doing the above did the trick?
[20:17] <islan> sirriffsalot, yeah, it didn't always work, so I just tried again
[20:17] <islan> seemed like I got it down with enough practice
[20:17] <sirriffsalot> islan, alright! One more thing if I may: I have many USB-[options].. which one should I use? There is USB-CDROM, USB-FDD, USB-HDD
[20:17] <_TheCoder_> Can I burn a cd and the install the os on the drive
[20:17] <sirriffsalot> islan, and some other which I cannot recall :-S
[20:18] <islan> sirriffsalot, choose the one that isn't there when you don't have your USB plugged in
[20:18] <kunji> robbietjuh: It will, but you then need to manually install to that portion don't you, i.e. that's not where apt-get will put things.
[20:18] <islan> sirriffsalot, it'll be  whatever name the manufacturer gave your USB stick, most likely
[20:18] <sirriffsalot> islan, I believe they are all there.. should I unplug all my usb-devices (including mouse+keyboard) to check?
[20:18] <robbietjuh> kunji, don't know that for sure (haven't tried it, I just saw the option was there).
[20:19] <sirriffsalot> islan, I boot it from the F12 button at bootup.. so the same BIOS options are always there :)

[20:27] <ThinkT510> LastElemental: why?
[20:28] <LastElemental> I have Arch Linux installed on my computer already however there are some things I need/want to use ubuntu for but I don't want ubuntu to overwrite Arch's install of grub
[20:28] <kunji> Dragon64: Hmm, honestly, no idea, if it's not an "error" and not showing up in the logs.  No idea what might cause that, maybe some environment setting?  But that sounds like a bug to me, might want to file a bug report.
[20:28] <ThinkT510> LastElemental: then get ubuntu's grub to use the root partition rather than the mbr
[20:28] <kunji> LastElemental: Yes, you can install it without GRUB2
[20:29] <LastElemental> so I would just tell the installer to install it to ubuntu's root and that won't cause any problems?

[20:44] <ThinkT510> Richiie: i was thinking you wanted to be able to install windows over networks, wouldn't the guys in ##windows be more knowledgeable? regardless of the os used
[20:45] <sgt-hagger> and it won't let me install the downloaded drivers, as it says there is a version of fglrx already detected.
[20:45] <orbitwhite> is it a good idea to mount /run on tmpfs?
[20:45] <Richiie> ThinkT510: it is basiclly the same theory on how to install OS over the network
[20:45] <IceGuest_75> hello, who can help me?
[20:46] <ThinkT510> IceGuest_75: depends what the issue is
[20:46] <majukarma> it depend about what kind of help you need
[20:46] <deinspanjer> is anyone around who is familiar with attempting to recover data from corrupted media using tools like ddrecover and foremost?  I have a 32GB SD card that malfunctioned and isn't being recognized by normal devices at all.  I've managed to get ubuntu to at least see it as a disk but it thinks it is 32MB, and I haven't figured out how to try to force it to pull a larger image.
[20:46] <IceGuest_75> with fedora
[20:46] <deinspanjer> If there is a more appropriate channel, please let me know and I apologize. :)
[20:47] <IceGuest_75> ok
[20:47] <ThinkT510> IceGuest_75: this channel is for ubuntu
[20:47] <majukarma> I have a solution for you install ubuntu and drop fedora
[20:47] <Alexxx> oh snap
[20:48] <sgt-hagger> and it won't let me install the downloaded drivers, as it says there is a version of fglrx already detected.
[20:48] <IceGuest_75> ok
[20:48] <sgt-hagger> Hey guys, I was going to update my drivers but someone said to run apt-get purge fglrx* first. This made my system unbootable. I can get in by adding nomodeset though. but I can't install any fglrx packages now in additional drivers window it says install failed, 'Please have a look at the log file for details: /var/log/jockey.log' and it won't let me install the downloaded drivers, as it says there is a version of fglrx already detected.
[20:48] <Blinkiz> Hi. Have a clean (deleted .mozilla directory) firefox profile where I can not save files to a directory that I own. Using the same firefox version downloaded from mozilla ftp and I have no issue saving my files.
[20:48] <sgt-hagger> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1553290/ this is the log
[20:49] <kunji> sgt-hagger: Google around a bit, removing the driver is a little more involved than just the purge line, I think there's a few other things that need removal, but I don't remember exactly.
[20:49] <_TheCoder_> it does work
[20:49] <_TheCoder_> *doesn't
[20:49] <_TheCoder_> the cd

[20:50] <deinspanjer> heh
[20:50] <ThinkT510> _TheCoder_: either you're not burning the iso properly or you haven't set it to boot from cd
[20:50] <_TheCoder_> I have set it to boot
[20:50] <qwebirc46252> Hello.  Without an internet connection, I want to install the absolute minimal/minimum set of packages required to run Ubuntu.  In other words, every pacakge that gets installed is absolutely necessary for the minimal Ubuntu system, and NO other packages get installed.  I know there is the Ubuntu minimal CD but this requires an internet connection.  Is it possible to do a minimal install offline?
[20:50] <majukarma> with cdrdao you will have the correct result...
[20:51] <orbitwhite> is it a good idea to mount /run on tmpfs?
[20:51] <kunji> _TheCoder_: The pc won't boot from the cd?  Are you sure the computer works?  And also you burned it as an iso right, not as a generic file?  The process the burner uses is different for those cases.
[20:51] <_TheCoder_> ok how do I install cdrdao
=== khalil is now known as Guest17374
[20:51] <majukarma> did you check BIOS to boot on CD ?
[20:51] <_TheCoder_> yes
[20:52] <Guest17374> hello every body
[20:52] <majukarma> hello sudo apt-get install cdrdao
[20:52] <kunji> _TheCoder_: Is the computer known to work?  If so, then the burning process used is suspect.
[20:52] <majukarma> Guest17374 : hello
[20:52] <_TheCoder_> yes it does work
[20:53] <_TheCoder_> I took out the old os
[20:53] <kunji> majukarma: he's not on Ubuntu, there is no apt-get on his machine T.T
[20:53] <_TheCoder_> I am on a mac
[20:53] <majukarma> this is  why i use cdrdao to burn cd. I never had issue with this tool
[20:53] <majukarma> on mac you should burn cd with dd
[20:54] <kunji> _TheCoder_: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BurningIsoHowto#Burning_from_Mac_OS_X
[20:54] <majukarma> dd if=file.iso of=/dev/cdrom
[20:54] <kunji> _TheCoder_: dd should also work
[20:54] <majukarma> not sure for /dev/cdrom...
[20:54] <xbskid> Does aptitude let you add apt repos?
[20:55] <ThinkT510> !aptitude | xbskid
[20:55] <ubottu> xbskid: aptitude is another terminal-based front-end to APT. You may encounter problems on multiarch installs (11.10 and higher) as aptitude cannot currently handle the same package with different architectures being installed at the same time. See http://pad.lv/831768 for more information.
[20:55] <kunji> _theCoder_: as he says, you will need to verify what device is the cd rom first though, might not be called cdrom
[20:55] <majukarma> the bootable property of the cd is in the ISO so you should be ok with dd
[20:56] <xbskid> A simple yes or no would've used up less electrons. :(
[20:56] <ThinkT510> xbskid: the point is: its best to stick with apt-get
[20:56] <Shogoot> Hi people. i installed  rtorrent while i was root....  my bad, anyone that can help me uninstall so i can reinstall it as user?
[20:56] <xbskid> ThinkT510: And that's relevant to my question...how?
[20:57] <kunji> xbskid: I think use of aptitude is discouraged right now because it doesn't handle multiarchitecture properly or something
[20:57] <_TheCoder_> ok it is writing again
[20:57] <majukarma> A frend of me burns a ubuntu iso from mac with "dd"
[20:57] <memand> Shogoot: I don't understand the problem?
[20:57] <kunji> majukarma: That does work, using dd, the link I gave him should also work though, and looks like it has a GUI
[20:57] <rubiconjosh> Shogoot: you normally have to be root to install software, unless you are purposely installing for one user only
[20:58] <ThinkT510> Shogoot: how did you install?
[20:58] <asaafj> i have been wasteing my time trying to install linux on a laptop that came with win8. i disabled the secure boot bullshit, then i proceeded to install ubuntu. i decided to make a clean install and delete all partitions. the installation just hung after that. now when booting the pc, i cannot even get into bios settings nor to boot from usb/cd. what can i do?
[20:58] <Shirakawasuna> Hi! I have LVM + RAID set up, so I have a form of redundancy for my data (as well as an offsite backup for the most important data), but I want some kind of snapshot-ie thing that will at least let me roll back file deletions, preferably file modifications - like a snapshot that takes up a minimal amount of space.
[20:58] <asaafj> not bios but UEFI
[20:58] <Shogoot> rubiconjosh, rtorrent should have isntaled some directories under my user, but did not
[20:58] <sgt-hagger> kunji, I opened synaptic and it detected my driver as broken, I marked it for complete removal and it apparently did, but the install still says it detected a previous version?
[20:58] <Shirakawasuna> I was looking at hard linking w/ rsync or rsnapshot, but I think that only protects against deletion to an extent. Is there any equivalent for file modifications, or am I SOL?
[20:59] <majukarma> did you check the ISO ?
[20:59] <rubiconjosh> Shogoot: you compiled from source, something like ./configre make make install? Usually programs do not create config files in your home directory until you run them the first time
[20:59] <majukarma> if you install from CD check md5 before using it to install something
[20:59] <Shogoot> rubiconjosh, not really, i did apt-get install rtorrent

[21:00] <asaafj> anyone any ideas what is going on? this uefi is absolute crap

[21:00] <memand> Shogoot: so you mean you are missing ~/.rtorrent.rc ?
[21:00] <majukarma> the installation goes wrong and freeze my PC because the ISO contains a write error...

[21:02] <usr13> !ueif | asaafj
[21:02] <kunji> Hmm, lots of people seem to be having trouble with UEFI... it didn't change anything for me though.
[21:02] <asaafj> ?
[21:02] <qwebirc58753> Hello.  Using EITHER the alternate installation CD OR desktop installation CD, is it possible to screen-capture _every_ aspect of installation, including for example, the entire screen text of every installer screen when using the alternate installation CD's text-based installer, or a screenshot of every instaler GUI page/screen when using the desktop installation CD's GUI installer?
[21:02] <ThinkT510> !uefi | asaafj
[21:02] <ubottu> asaafj: UEFI is a specification that defines a software interface between an operating system and platform firmware, it is meant as a replacement for the BIOS. For information on how to set up and install Ubuntu and its derivatives on UEFI machines please read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UEFI
[21:02] <asaafj> i see that
[21:02] <usr13> ThinkT510: Thank you
[21:03] <memand> qwebirc58753: For what purpose?
[21:03] <asaafj> i am saying is that all partitions were deleted, the installation froze. then after trying to boot up, my laptop goes into black blank screen.
[21:03] <asaafj> no usb/cd boots either
[21:03] <usr13> !nomodeset | asaafj
[21:03] <ubottu> asaafj: A common kernel (boot)parameter is nomodeset, which is needed for some graphic cards that otherwise boot into a black screen or show corrupted splash screen. See http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1613132 on how to use this parameter
[21:04] <majukarma> !tab
[21:04] <ubottu> You can use your <tab> key for autocompletion of nicknames in IRC, as well as for completion of filenames and programs on the command line.
[21:04] <qwebirc58753> memand:  I'd like to preserve a complete record of exactly how I installed Ubuntu...  That is why I want a complete text/GUI screen-capture of every alternate_CD/desktop_CD installation screen.
[21:04] <majukarma> ubottu: yes it works !
[21:04] <ubottu> majukarma: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
=== gwon is now known as Craig_E
[21:05] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Should be able to, you can boot to the desktop before starting the install and then install whatever programs you need to take the shots.  Might be better to use a video capture card on another machine to get it though.
[21:05] <asaafj> thank
[21:05] <asaafj> thanks*
=== Guest96276 is now known as ryanclancy000
[21:05] <kunji> qwebirc58753: The install isn't that complicated though, I don't think you would really need to know every choice you made during it.
[21:06] <qwebirc58753> kunji:  can this screen-capture4 also be done with the alternate CD's text-based installer?
[21:06] <majukarma> kunji: you should also save the installed package to a file to replay the same installation
[21:06] <kunji> qwebirc58753: With the alternate I'm not sure, also though I think I heard the alternate is not officially supported anymore?
[21:07] <lee8oi> just curious. Has anyone every tried dd to write an iso to sd card?
[21:07] <ThinkT510> kunji: starting with 12.10 the alternate cd is no longer offered
[21:07] <majukarma> lee8oi: yop
[21:07] <kunji> lee8oi: yes, it works
=== nashant__ is now known as nashant
[21:07] <lee8oi> beautiful. thanks guys
[21:08] <_TheCoder_> kunji it doesn't work I have done everything the way you have told me
[21:08] <majukarma> kunji: lee8oi: done that for the raspberry pi ubuntu sd card. work fine.
[21:08] <qwebirc58753> ThinkT510:  If the alternate CD is no longer offered, then how does one get greater customization of the Ubuntu installation, for example, the "Expert mode" only found in the alternate CD?
[21:09] <majukarma> dd is powerfull :)
[21:09] <lee8oi> majukarma, thanks. Good to know. I have a dell mini 12 with a bad hard drive (missing hd now :) trying to salvage it with sd....
[21:09] <kunji> _TheCoder_: Well, I don't know what to tell you, some comps are just finicky T.T
[21:09] <majukarma> should change your hd
[21:09] <kunji> majukarma: Yeah, I've done it for the pi and for OLPC
[21:09] <_TheCoder_> ok then I give up but thanks for your help though
[21:09] <majukarma> what is OPLC ?
[21:09] <memand> lee8oi kunji: Is UNetbooin not better for that job?
[21:10] <ThinkT510> qwebirc58753: if i remember correctly they moved the features to the normal install media
[21:10] <ThinkT510> majukarma: one laptop per child
[21:10] <lee8oi> memand, not via terminal, via ssh :)
[21:10] <kunji> _TheCoder_: Someone else might know more than me, and have some other ideas, also if they're someone you know that can check it out in person, that's usually easier, as communication is a bit difficult through only text.
[21:10] <majukarma> kunji: the only thing to know is that SD manufacturer do not make exactly the same capacity
[21:11] <memand> lee8oi: Ah :) Then go for dd ;)
[21:11] <majukarma> lee8oi
[21:11] <kunji> memand: For SD cards, not really, unetbootin is easier, but tends to be more finicky in my opinion.
[21:11] <memand> kunji:
[21:12] <majukarma> lee8oi: a SDHC should be downsized +/- 4Gb -> depend of the manufacturer
[21:12] <memand> kunji: Ok, haven't had a chance/reasson to try dd yet...
[21:12] <lee8oi> majukarma, I"m attempting it on a 2gb card
[21:12] <sandbags> I just updated a Linode from 10.04LTS to 12.04LTS and I'm having an odd problem with the MySQL2 ruby gem. I'm not turning up anything in Google, I wonder if any of you guys might be able to suggest something? https://gist.github.com/raw/2080facace1228112c7d/4f97d8428e6dd60e9d3c9cbef7caea2fae1b1d06/gistfile1.txt
[21:12] <qwebirc58753> So then, is the "Expert mode" installation feature now available on the 12.10 (GUI) desktop installation CD?
[21:12] <lee8oi> actually its a 2gb micro sd in an adapter
[21:13] <majukarma> lee8oi: check size of your SD before using it
[21:13] <lee8oi> majukarma, thanks, I'm a linux veteran, I just never tried to dd to an sdcard.
[21:13] <kunji> memand: The biggest reason people don't just always dd is because a lot of people tend to mess up and choose the wrong device to write to.  UNetbootin works, but sometimes I need to write something several times, also sometimes I need to write something that is not an iso.
[21:13] <majukarma> you can dd on everything
[21:13] <majukarma> dd is powerfull
[21:14] <memand> most cli tools are :)
[21:14] <memand> kunji: That makes sense :)
[21:15] <memand> must say that my favorite cli tool is still sl :P
[21:17] <lee8oi> tmux, vim, and ssh. Those are my must-haves of cli. I run a server which I connect to remotely.
[21:17] <memand> vim is gold, period.
[21:18] <memand> I haven't been in a situation where I needed ssh or tmux. But it is powerfull stuff  indeed :)
[21:19] <Nullifi3d> <3 tmux
[21:22] <Jef91> Where can I find package sources for these packages? http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.7.3-raring/
[21:22] <ikonia> Jef91: errr in that PPA
[21:22] <ikonia> but I strongly suggest you don't use them
[21:23] <Jef91> ikonia: whats wrong with them and where in that PPA? They aren't stashed anywhere obvious
[21:23] <qwebirc58753> Without an internet connection, I want to install the absolute minimal/minimum set of packages required to run Ubuntu.  In other words, every pacakge that gets installed is absolutely necessary for the minimal Ubuntu system, and NO other packages get installed.  I know there is the Ubuntu minimal CD but this requires an internet connection.  Is it possible to do a minimal install offline?
[21:23] <ikonia> Jef91: you're looking at the PPA in that URL, and they are not meant for your distro .....so compatability and stability with your platform may be quite poor
[21:24] <ikonia> Jef91: is there a reason you want these packages, as you don't really seem to have a grasp of what you are doing
[21:24] <Jef91> ikonia: No reason to be a jerk. All I asked was for package sources.
[21:24] <Jef91> You don't have an answer to my question then bugger off.
[21:24] <ikonia> Jef91: how is offering you advice being a Jef91
[21:24] <ikonia> Jef91: drop the attitude, I'm trying to help you
[21:24] <dwedew> hi, how do I add a extra dns server? in the file /etc/resolv.conf it says do not modify the file
[21:24] <BlueEagle> qwebirc58753: You want the alternative install CD which will allow you to install a server-system. If you want anything smaller than this then it is no longer Ubuntu.
[21:25] <xangua> (15:22:44) ikonia: Jef91: errr in that PPA - answered 3 minutes ago
[21:25] <ikonia> Jef91: you're asking where the packages are....yet you've posted the URL where they are
[21:25] <ikonia> Jef91: that SUGGESTS you don't know what you are doing
[21:25] <ikonia> Jef91: which if you don't know what you are doing, you should strongly consider not changing kernels for no reason
[21:25] <Jef91> ikonia: I asked for package SOURCES
[21:25] <Jef91> SOURCES
[21:25] <ikonia> hence why I asked you what is the reason you want these packages
[21:25] <Jef91> as in SOURCE CODE
[21:25] <islan> hey
[21:25] <ikonia> Jef91: they will be in the source debs in the same PPA
[21:25] <islan> I am trying to connect my wii remote to my 12.10 laptop.  I have downloaded wmgui and its associated files.  When I tried to connect, it did not detect anything (I held down the 1+2 buttons as well as the Sync button).  hcitool dev returns hci0 and its MAC address. when I run hcitool scan, it still doesn't detect anything.  I made my bluetooth device discoverable, and my wife scanned on her nexus 7 but could not discover my laptop.
[21:25] <Jef91> Source code != .debs
[21:25] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Have you tried the minimal installer?  Maybe it doesn't force you to, I don't know.  Also though, if you're going for such a minimal install, then is Ubuntu what you actually want?
[21:25] <Jef91> this link -> http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v3.7.3-raring/
[21:26] <Jef91> has some patches
[21:26] <Jef91> and .debs
[21:26] <Jef91> no full source code
[21:26] <ikonia> Jef91: yes, it's MAINLINE kernel
[21:26] <ikonia> Jef91: so you get it from upstream....again hence not knowing what you are doing
[21:26] <ikonia> hence why I'm asking the questions to try to guide you
[21:26] <Jef91> OK so clearly the source code isn't at the PPA I just linked to
[21:26] <memand> ikonia just let Jef91 break stuff then...
[21:26] <Jef91> Which is what you said.
[21:26] <ikonia> Jef91: it is,
[21:27] <Jef91> No, patches and packages are there.
[21:27] <Jef91> You just said yourself the source comes from the mainline.
[21:27] <ikonia> Jef91: the patches are the source code, as the base is mainline
[21:27] <kunji> Jef91: The source comes from many places, including the mainline kernel
[21:27] <ikonia> that's the source for those debs, the patches
[21:27] <ikonia> because the base is mainline
[21:27] <Jef91> Yep.
[21:27] <Jef91> And that clearly means
[21:27] <Jef91> the source code isn't all at that PPA
[21:27] <Jef91> which is all I was asking.
[21:27] <ikonia> Jef91: - do what you want, you have no idea, so just carry on
[21:27] <kunji> Jef91: Right ^_^
[21:28] <Jef91> I forgot how useless this channel is.
[21:28] <BlueEagle> Jef91: It means you need to download the mainline sources and then apply the patches. You will not find a .deb containing the mainline with these patches unles it is also on the site.
[21:28] <ikonia> Jef91: yeah, it's just told exactly what you needed to know because you didn't know, it's usless,
[21:28] <Jef91> Arrogant  fuckers.
[21:28] <BlueEagle> Jef91: And I side with ikonia on the competance assertion as this is really basic.
[21:29] <kunji> well.... he was rude
[21:29] <ikonia> well, he doesn't need to worry about how useless the channel is any more, so lets move on
[21:29] <qwebirc58753> kunji:  AFAIK, minimal installer (~30 MiB CD) requires internet connection.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD .  For a minimal install, if not Ubuntu, then what else is there?
[21:30] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Debian
[21:30] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Or say TinyCore if you want something really small, or Damn Small Linux
[21:33] <qwebirc58753> kunji:  Is Debian more minimal than Ubuntu's minimal install?  Tiny Core and DSL do not offer the packages that I want...  (Debian might)
[21:33] <w30> Lubuntu is a very small distribution
[21:34] <xbskid> Linux from Scratch? :)
[21:34] <xbskid> Phoronix ran an article recently about Slax; might want to look into that if you want something small and modular.
[21:34] <kovu> how do i connect to a irc channel
[21:35] <ThinkT510> kovu: you are in one now
[21:35] <xbskid> kovu: I think you've managed that without knowing
[21:35] <kunji> qwebirc58753: http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/  It sounds like you could use the Net Install image and just uncheck any other packages.
[21:35] <kovu> i want to connect to #irc.themanaworld.org
[21:35] <ThinkT510> kovu: thats a server
[21:35] <xbskid> ThinkT510: It's a channel now. :D
[21:35] <ikonia> kovu: you're using xchat, join #xchat and ask for help how to use it
[21:35] <kovu> right so how do i connect a irc to it
[21:36] <ikonia> kovu: /join #xchat - and ask how to use the client
[21:36] <ikonia> #xchat will help you use your client
[21:36] <ikonia> kovu: we support ubuntu here, not how to use irc
[21:36] <kovu> ok
[21:36] <xbskid> Why does xchat report the kernel version? O.o

[21:37] <ikonia> xbskid: again join #xchat and ask
[21:37] <BlueEagle> qwebirc58753: Again, you want the alternate intall ISO. This will allow you to set up a server system. This is the smallest thing you get that can be called Ubuntu.
[21:37] <qwebirc58753> To explain what I mean by minimal:  I want an absolutely minimal installation with minimal amount of processes running and no X11/window_manager/desktop_environment.  I want to be able to install my own minimal window manager manually, for example JWM or IceWM...
[21:37] <kunji> kovu: That's a server not a channel isn't it?  It's probably better to ask that in #freenode though (a channel on this server)
[21:37] <qwebirc58753> kunji:  But I do not have access to an internet connection at installation time.  So, I need the entire installation to be done offline.  Is there a way to install a minimal Debian offline?
[21:38] <ThinkT510> BlueEagle: no, the smallest is the mini iso
[21:38] <qwebirc58753> and minimal amount of pacakges installed of course...
[21:38] <bekks> qwebirc58753: No.
[21:38] <BlueEagle> ThinkT510: No, because that requires an internet connection to download extra packages. The goal here is not the smallest ISO but the smallest footprint system after 1st install.
[21:39] <kunji> qwebirc58753: That's what I'm saying, you can probably run it, uncheck everything, as it says the net install comes with a base system (as opposed to the business card install).
[21:39] <kunji> qwebirc58753: I'm not absolutely sure, but there's a good chance it would work.
[21:39] <lee8oi> If you are bored with your window manager...install e17 and play with it until you love your desktop.
[21:39] <Guest68240> hello, how can i save a file to a remote network folder?

[21:40] <BlueEagle> !ot | lee8oi
[21:40] <ubottu> lee8oi: #ubuntu is the Ubuntu support channel, for all Ubuntu-related support questions. Please use #ubuntu-offtopic for other topics (though our !guidelines apply there too). Thanks!
[21:40] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Even that probably comes with a GUI though, hmm, the server version of Ubuntu comes with no GUI, I'm not sure how big that is
[21:40] <lee8oi> really? you warned me for that?
[21:40] <ThinkT510> lee8oi: its a support channel
[21:41] <ikonia> lee8oi: we don't need random spouting off.
[21:41] <lee8oi> ok guys. Point made.......geez.
[21:42] <lee8oi> and don't message me privately without asking.
[21:42] <VLanX> could anybody help me creating a shortcut to a network drive on my desktop?
[21:42] <qwebirc58753> So, just to confirm, Debian's minimal install is even more minimal than Ubuntu's minimal install?
[21:43] <ikonia> lee8oi: no-one has pm'd you about it that I'm aware of
[21:43] <ikonia> qwebirc58753: no,
[21:43] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Maybe this is what you want: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/LowMemorySystems
[21:44] <islan> is there a rule for long I should wait before re-asking a question?
[21:44] <lee8oi> ikonia, on the contrary yes. I was pm'd.
[21:44] <ikonia> islan: 10-15minutes is the norm
[21:44] <islan> k k
[21:44] <BlueEagle> lee8oi: Just to be clear; were you PM-ed by Ubottu with a link to the guidelines?
[21:45] <qwebirc58753> kunji:  I read that page already...  But I still want to confirm whether or not Debian's minimal is even more minimal than Ubuntu's minimal or vice versa...
[21:45] <lee8oi> that was one of them.
[21:45] <bekks> qwebirc58753: Third time: no.
[21:45] <islan> I am trying to connect my wii remote to my 12.10 laptop.  I have downloaded wmgui and its associated files.  When I tried to connect, it did not detect anything (I held down the 1+2 buttons as well as the Sync button).  hcitool dev returns hci0 and its MAC address. when I run hcitool scan, it still doesn't detect anything.  I made my bluetooth device discoverable, and my wife scanned on her nexus 7 but could not discover my laptop.
[21:46] <BlueEagle> lee8oi: Then perhaps you shold review the guidelines. I am sorry if you took offense from the reminder, but you were in violation both in content and tone in my humble opinion.
[21:46] <islan> so I'm trying to figure out if my bluetooth is even functioning
[21:46] <kunji> qwebirc58753: They say no, I don't know myself, I'm curious why space is at such a premium that it matters though.
[21:46] <lee8oi> BlueEagle, all I did was made a suggestion about the window manager....good god
[21:46] <lee8oi> get off my ass please?
[21:46] <ikonia> tone it down please
[21:47] <BlueEagle> lee8oi: And had you done so in the off-topic (ie. not the support channel) it would have been great. Had you apologized instead of giving tone this discussion would have ended a while ago. But you keep going so what are we to do, in your opinion?
[21:48] <dwedew> I need support
[21:48] <dwedew> I put a local domain in my host file but when I look it up, it still return another ip
[21:48] <qwebirc58753> bekks:  Then, do you mean that Ubuntu's minimal is even more minimal than Debian's minimal?  Or are they equal in their "minimalism"?
=== kubotsu is now known as Guest68990
[21:48] <bekks> qwebirc58753: No. Which part of "is this or that smaller than something other? No." is unclear? :)
[21:49] <bekks> qwebirc58753: They are pretty equal.
[21:49] <qwebirc58753> kunji:  I'm an obsessive control-freak person, that wants more control over what gets installed on my system... I do not want any more packages installed (any more processes running, etc.) than what I actually need/use...
[21:49] <lee8oi> sorry for being off topic BlueEagle. Won't happen again. You and ubottu are now on ignore.
[21:50] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Then shouldn't you just use Arch?
[21:50] <ikonia> lee8oi: not a good idea to put the bot on ignore, it offers important information
[21:50] <bekks> qwebirc58753: Then setup a LFS.
[21:50] <w30> check out Mulinux for a minimal Linux distribution. Without a GUI it fits on a floppy disk.
[21:50] <ikonia> lee8oi: but it's up to you
[21:50] <Nasser> hi
[21:50] <BlueEagle> dwedew: In /etc/hosts you added 123.123.123.123 example.com and when pinging example.com it returns a different IP? If so your resolution order is out of whack. Please review /etc/nsswitch.conf I think
[21:50] <lee8oi> ikonia, thanks for the recommendation. I'll keep that in mind.
[21:50] <ikonia> BlueEagle: gets a bit more complex with the frustrating dns helper now in ubuntu
[21:51] <gonzojive> I am prompted endlessly with "Wireless Network Authentication Required" dialog boxes
[21:51] <gonzojive> I cannot exit out of them
[21:51] <dwedew> BlueEagle, can u help me ?
[21:51] <gonzojive> they just pollute my screen
[21:51] <dwedew> :(
[21:52] <gonzojive> is there some other wireless manager for ubuntu?
[21:52] <BlueEagle> ikonia: Oh, I was not aware that Ubuntu was doing a Microsoft and getting "helpful". :/
[21:52] <qwebirc58753> kunji:  IINM, Arch requires much more time/effort in manual configuration, and I cannot afford to invest that much time in configuration.  I prefer to go with a distribution that has reasonable default configuration so that I do not have to do that manually.  In other words, I want more control over the system's footprint, but not necessarly more headache in manual configuration.
[21:52] <gonzojive> I remember reading about one that worked better
[21:52] <ThinkT510> gonzojive: wicd
[21:52] <Nasser> would you please suggest some applications
[21:52] <BlueEagle> dwedew: If what Ikonia sais is true then apperantly I cannot. I am of an older school apperantly.
[21:52] <gonzojive> ThinkT510: do you recommend using wicd instead?
[21:52] <ikonia> BlueEagle: it's the localdns forwarder that runs by default
[21:53] <ikonia> BlueEagle: eg: resolv.conf now points at 127.0.0.1 by default and forwards.....
[21:53] <ThinkT510> gonzojive: i stick with the default, i'm just naming an alternative
[21:53] <dwedew> Ubuntu server used to be easy to setup
[21:53] <bekks> qwebirc58753: Then either use a bigger footprint with the benefit of less configuration, or use a smaller footprint with the cost of more configuration.
[21:53] <dwedew> now it is pain in the ass
[21:53] <ikonia> so changing the search order in nsswitch may not be the best move, (it maybe fine though too) got to apply a little bit of thought
[21:54] <bekks> dwedew: Would you mind stopping the ranting and just explaining your actual issue?
[21:54] <ThinkT510> qwebirc58753: best ask for suggestions in ##linux
[21:54] <Nasser> thank you
[21:54] <dwedew> I just install ubuntu server and trying to point local.mydomain.com to my local ip instead. but it still resolve to a public ip
[21:54] <zyngawow> Can anyone please help me with this? http://askubuntu.com/questions/245493/rt3092-wifi-not-working-it-was-working-before I will answer whatever you want
[21:55] <bekks> dwedew: And how do you try to do it?
[21:55] <dwedew> bekks, by adding 127.0.0.1  local.mydomain.com to my /etc/hosts file
[21:55] <bekks> dwedew: I bet you have two 127.0.0.1 entries now, do you?
[21:55] <dwedew> bekks, yes
[21:56] <qwebirc58753> I figure either Debian's minimal or Ubuntu's minimal is still small enough for my satisfaction, without having to go through the headache of configuring Arch/LFS/Gentoo/etc.
[21:56] <bekks> dwedew: Then delete your wrong second entry, and add the "local.mydomain.com" to the first entry - and it will work like ever before.
[21:56] <dwedew> bekks, just tried.
[21:56] <dwedew> it still resolve to a public ip
[21:57] <bekks> dwedew: Then how does that line look like now?
[21:57] <dwedew> 127.0.0.1       localhost, local.domain.com
[21:57] <dwedew> like that right?
[21:57] <bekks> Wrong.
[21:57] <ThinkT510> qwebirc58753: if you are choosing ubuntu then ask a support question, if you are unsure then join ##linux please
[21:57] <bekks> dwedew: 127.0.0.1 localhost local.domain.com
[21:58] <dwedew> bekks, changed, do I need to restart networking?
[21:58] <bekks> dwedew: No. Just restart your browser, when trying to access that domain from your browser.
[21:59] <dwedew> bekks, I am running ubuntu in a vm on windows
[21:59] <dwedew> I am doing host local.domain.com to resovle the ip
[21:59] <ikonia> dwedew: are you trying to view the website on your windows PC
[22:00] <dwedew> now it still resolve to the external ip
[22:00] <ikonia> dwedew: or the ubuntu vm
[22:00] <ikonia> dwedew: are you looking up the website on the windows machine, or the ubuntu machine
[22:00] <dwedew> ikonia, on the ubuntu machine
[22:00] <ikonia> dwedew: what is the domain you are actually trying to look up
[22:01] <dwedew> ikonia, local.yobile.eu
[22:01] <kunji> qwebirc58753: Arch really isn't that bad to configure, they've got very good documentation to guide you through it, but yeah, Debian or Ubuntu should work fine.
[22:01] <islan> so does anybody know anything about troubleshooting bluetooth?
[22:01] <dwedew> now it resolve to 176.62.193.21 but I want it to resolve to 127.0.0.1 when I use it in the ubuntu vm
[22:02] <ikonia> dwedew: in the ubuntu vm - what happens if you ping local.yobile.eu
[22:02] <dwedew> ikonia, I get pings back from the outside

[22:22] <ikonia> dwarder: up to you
[22:22] <ikonia> depends on how it's being installed
[22:22] <lucian_ubuntu> hello guys
[22:22] <dwarder> ikonia: k,thanx
[22:22] <lucian_ubuntu> what's the command to install kde plasma descktop on ubuntu ?
[22:22] <ThinkT510> !kde | lucian_ubuntu
[22:22] <ubottu> lucian_ubuntu: KDE (http://kde.org) is an open community that creates and maintains software including the Plasma desktop.  To install from Ubuntu: « sudo apt-get install  kubuntu-desktop », or see http://help.ubuntu.com/community/InstallingKDE . See  http://kubuntu.org for more information.
[22:23] <ikonia> install the kubuntu-desktop package
[22:24] <lucian_ubuntu> but isn't there a desktop interface that is more like gnome classic?
[22:25] <ikonia> lucian_ubuntu: ......kde doesn't look like gnome
[22:25] <lucian_ubuntu> i know that
[22:25] <lucian_ubuntu>  but i just asked
[22:25] <lucian_ubuntu> is there?
[22:27] <ikonia> ...kde is nothing like gnome-classic
[22:27] <lucian_ubuntu> ikonia i know that kde it's close to windows 7 interface
[22:28] <ikonia> lucian_ubuntu: I don't see it close to windows 7
[22:28] <lucian_ubuntu> it has a taskbar in the lower side of the display
[22:29] <kunji> lucian_ubuntu: I think you're referring to the gnome-panel package, I don't know how long that is going to be supported for/exist for though.
[22:29] <ikonia> so ?
[22:29] <ikonia> actually, I don't care
[22:29] <lucian_ubuntu> what are yu using ?
[22:29] <ikonia> what does it matter what I use
[22:29] <dwarder> i've downloaded this jdk http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk6u38-downloads-1877406.html it created jdk1.6.0_38/ in my download dir. where should i put it in order to install netbeans?

[22:30] <ikonia> dwarder: anywhere you want
[22:30] <lucian_ubuntu> thx for helping me ikonia

[22:38] <Devlin> hey folks
[22:40] <Devlin> I want to install Ubuntu without a GUI, I have 12.10 sitting on the boot screen, how can I force it to use the text-based installer?
[22:40] <ikonia> Devlin: you can't
[22:40] <Devlin> why not
[22:40] <ikonia> because it's not an option
[22:40] <Devlin> I could do it with 12.04
[22:40] <ikonia> Devlin: how did you do it with 12.04 ?
[22:41] <Devlin> I used the alternate ISO
[22:41] <ikonia> right
[22:41] <ikonia> the text based installer is normally part of the alternative cd
[22:41] <ikonia> so use the alternative iso for 12.10
[22:41] <Devlin> I couldn't find it
[22:41] <Devlin> does it work with the USB tool?
[22:41] <ikonia> no idea
[22:41] <IdleOne> ikonia: I believe the alternate iso was dropped from 12.10
[22:42] <Devlin> well that's lame
[22:42] <ikonia> really ?
[22:42] <IdleOne> Devlin: you would need to use the server iso
[22:42] <ikonia> what's lame?
[22:42] <ikonia> hang on
[22:42] <ikonia> no that can'tbe right
[22:42] <FloodBot1> ikonia: Please don't flood; use http://paste.ubuntu.com to paste; don't use Enter as punctuation.
[22:42] <ikonia> he doesn't need to install a server os
[22:42] <Devlin> I don't want a server OS
[22:42] <Devlin> I just want to start from a commandline and no graphical fluff installed
[22:42] <Devlin> since I have scripts to do that part
[22:42] <iceroot> Devlin: that is ubuntu server
[22:43] <iceroot> Devlin: ubuntu without a gui
[22:43] <ikonia> no
[22:43] <IdleOne> Devlin: I realise this, just saying that if the text install (alternate iso) was dropped, you can do it with the server install iso
[22:43] <grathm> i have music that is a combo of fresh downloads and stuff of of various HDDs. is there a good way to make sure im not backing up duplicates? I have stuff spread around on various HDDs, mine and friends, so i want to check that those files in my laptop music folder dont already exist elsewhere.
[22:43] <ikonia> hang on a moment
[22:43] <Devlin> I've spent all day trying to get this shit working and all I needed to do was get the server ISO?
[22:43] <iceroot> ikonia: and what is the difference betwen ubuntu server and ubuntu-desktop without ubuntu-desktop?
[22:44] <iceroot> Devlin: or the minimal iso
[22:44] <designbybeck> Anyone having problems with Ubuntu 12.10 and the lastest Skype?

[22:44] <ubottu> designbybeck: A high percentage of the first questions asked in this channel start with "Does anyone/anybody..." Why not ask your next question (the real one) and find out? See also !details, !gq, and !poll.
[22:44] <designbybeck> I'm on  a new install of both... and it doesn't seem to be working
[22:44] <ikonia> https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2012-August/035675.html - I'm just reading through this thread
[22:44] <OerHeks>  server iso voor raid and text install?
[22:45] <iceroot> OerHeks: yes, the new server iso can handle raid
[22:46] <iceroot> since ubuntu-server and ubuntu-desktop are using the same kernel the only difference is the missing ubuntu-desktop metapackage
[22:46] <iceroot> both are using ubuntu-minimal as minimum meta-package
=== PatDickeyIsAway is now known as PatrickDickey
[22:46] <iceroot> OerHeks: you can also install a raid after the installation is done so there is no need for it in the installer
[22:47] <OerHeks> thank you for confirmation, iceroot , i read that somewere. also for full disk encryption?
[22:47] <ikonia> iceroot: that can't be right, as why ship 2 CD's if one has a desktop package the other doesn't and thats the only difference
[22:47] <Devlin> Doesn't Ubiquity have the ability to specify not to install a GUI? or am I stuck spending ANOTHER 30 minutes downloading and copying to USB?
[22:47] <ikonia> Devlin: no, it doesn't have that option
[22:47] <iceroot> ikonia: the server iso have for example vim and other packages which are not on the desktop cd
[22:47] <Devlin> It should. That post is bitching about having less ISOs to QA, why not have the installer cover more bases
[22:48] <ikonia> Devlin: tone it down, there is no need for it
[22:48] <ikonia> iceroot: are you saying the desktop cd does not ship with vim now ?
[22:48] <Devlin> Sorry. but I spent all day trying to get this working properly and I'm just a little bit ticked off by it
[22:48] <iceroot> ikonia: vim is removed (imo) its just vi and vim is in the main repo
[22:48] <iceroot> ikonia: a normal ubuntu installation does not have vim anymore
[22:48] <ikonia> vi is a symlink to vim
[22:49] <iceroot> ikonia: to vim.tiny which is vi
[22:49] <iceroot> ikonia: its not the real vim
[22:49] <ikonia> ok, so the full vim is what you're referencing, phew
[22:49] <PatrickDickey> designbybeck what is it doing, or isn't it doing? Can you give us more information than "it doesn't seem to be working", please?
[22:49] <iceroot> ikonia:  the "real" vim where you can use arrow keys and so on :) that one is missing on the desktop-cd
[22:49] <iceroot> ikonia: but it is on the server-cd
[22:50] <iceroot> ikonia: the same goes for openssh-server
[22:50] <iceroot> imo openssh-server is no longer on the desktop cd but on the server cd
[22:50] <iceroot> ikonia: but the normal installation (server-os) or desktop-version ( without ubuntu-desktop) will be the same
[22:50] <PatrickDickey> iceroot If I were to guess, I'd say that they put it on the server cd because you typically won't have a desktop (and thus won't have access to gedit or Leapfrog or Kate).
[22:51] <iceroot> ikonia: some time ago the server was using pae as default and the desktop was using normal x86 but that changed
[22:51] <iceroot> PatrickDickey: ubuntu comes with vi as default so there is already a text-editor
[22:51] <iceroot> PatrickDickey: and you dont want kate, gedit or something like that on a server
[22:51] <Lunar_Lander> hi, when I insert a CD into the drive, ubuntu used to ask if it should open the folder, start K3B or what I would do, now it just opens the DVD maker window
[22:52] <grathm> i have music that is a combo of fresh downloads and stuff of of various HDDs. is there a good way to make sure im not backing up duplicates? I have stuff spread around on various HDDs, mine and friends, so i want to check that those files in my laptop music folder dont already exist elsewhere. any ideas?
[22:52] <designbybeck> Thank you for the response PatrickDickey. I've used Ubuntu and Skype successfully for the past few years. This is the first time I don't get audio and all with skype and get a error message that says...
[22:52] <Devlin> grathm, are they likely to have the same file names?
[22:52] <Lunar_Lander> how can I get ubuntu back to asking?
[22:52] <Lunar_Lander> I think I might have checked "save this setting" by accident
[22:53] <Devlin> grathm, I see you potentially having to sort through them all manually though
[22:53] <designbybeck> well... one sec... this is a new build. ASUS motherboard built in sound. Plus MSI Nvidia card with HDMI. So PatrickDickey it is listing a lot of things. I did find that Sysdefault(unknown) seemed to work
[22:53] <iceroot> Devlin: so use the minimal iso or the server-iso
[22:53] <iceroot> Devlin: or use the desktop iso and remove the gui
[22:53] <designbybeck> but nothing else... some gave errors... and others looked like it connected to the test call ok, but I never heard antyhing
[22:53] <Devlin> ugh, faff.
[22:53] <Devlin> but ok
[22:53] <Devlin> i'll do it in the morning
[22:53] <iceroot> !purekde | Devlin (only do the remove stuff)
[22:53] <ubottu> Devlin (only do the remove stuff): If you want to remove all !Gnome packages and have a default !Kubuntu system follow the instructions here « http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/purekde »
[22:54] <Devlin> ok
[22:54] <grathm> Devlin: if off of one of the hdd's filename should be same, i have 3 partitions to sort...
[22:54] <PatrickDickey> iceroot So what was your question again? You mentioned that the server CD comes with the full version of vim, yet the desktop comes with vi.tiny.
[22:54] <iceroot> PatrickDickey: i didnt have a question
[22:54] <Devlin> grathm, you have some work to do then
[22:55] <PatrickDickey> designbybeck do you have sound normally outside of skype?
[22:55] <grathm> Devlin: damn, thats not what i wanted to hear. thanks for the response though, saves me fruitless time trying
[22:55] <ubuntu-tester> grathm: it depends on what is 'duplicate' to you. exact bit-to-bit copy, minor tags differences, remix, remake, cover, etc.
[22:55] <Devlin> yeah I'd just go through it
[22:55] <grathm> ubuntu-tester: dupe in this case should be same filename
[22:56] <Devlin> hm
[22:56] <Devlin> there's a command to do it
[22:56] <redengin_> anyone know where I can find the current status of ATI drivers for 12?
[22:56] <PatrickDickey> redengin_ which card do you have?
[22:56] <Lunar_Lander> any idea?
[22:56] <ubuntu-tester> grathm: just the filename? discarding file size and contents?
[22:56] <designbybeck> yes PatrickDickey, I'm jammin' to some Spotify right now! ;) ... I'm going to test this call with a friend. Thanks for the feedback thus far!
[22:57] <redengin_> HD 7640G
[22:57] <designbybeck> PatrickDickey: Ironically I just dropped around $2500 total on this system, and I didn't think about webcam, or external speakers!
[22:57] <PatrickDickey> designbybeck I'd say check Skype's settings then to make sure it's using the right card for sound. I know on mine (I have built-in and a card) it needs to be tweaked.

[22:58] <PatrickDickey> Lunar_Lander have you gone into Preferred Applications and checked there?
[22:59] <Lunar_Lander> one moment
[22:59] <PatrickDickey> redengin_ http://support.amd.com click on Search for Drivers on the left, and go through the steps. They released Catalyst 13.1 a few days ago.
[22:59] <Lunar_Lander> I have to find the german equivalent to that
[23:00] <redengin_> PatrickDickey, just tried that, it locks up randomly during boot with the new Catalyst Release on Ubuntu 12.10
[23:00] <ubuntu-tester> grathm: there are some tools to find duplicates by names
[23:01] <PatrickDickey> redengin_ there should be a link to previous versions on that page.
[23:01] <PatrickDickey> Lunar_Lander is it bevorzugte Anwendungen (Preferred Applications)?
[23:01] <Lunar_Lander> no
[23:01] <Lunar_Lander> but in the forums I read that you can get there via the system settings
[23:01] <Lunar_Lander> searching now
[23:02] <ubuntu-tester> Lunar_Lander: your release?
[23:02] <Lunar_Lander> 12.04
[23:02] <Devlin> iceroot, can I replace remove with purge? I don't like extraneous config files
[23:02] <grathm_> ubuntu-tester: something happend, my connection crashed right when you responded. not sure what you said.
[23:02] <iceroot> Devlin: sure
[23:02] <Devlin> woohoo
[23:03] <Lunar_Lander> PatrickDickey, went to system settings, then the gear that says "information"
[23:03] <Lunar_Lander> ah no, that just gives like the music player and so on
[23:03] <grathm_> Devlin: same to you, my connection crashed, not sure what you said
[23:03] <Lunar_Lander> ah
[23:03] <Lunar_Lander> under exchangable media
[23:03] <redengin_> perhaps I just have to wait out the next release
[23:03] <Devlin> don't worry about it I said nothing of consequence

[23:04] <grathm_> Devlin: so the main idea is manually sort... that sucks but at least you saved me some time trying, thanks.
[23:05] <ubuntu-tester> grathm: just the filename? discarding file size and contents?
[23:05] <grathm_> ubuntu-tester: yea, i could work with that
[23:05] <Devlin> grathm_, let this be a lesson to you to keep your files better arranged
[23:05] <PatrickDickey> Lunar_Lander ubuntu tweaks might help you out, although I'm not sure if it's supported here.
[23:05] <grathm_> well, they are not all 'mine' even though i have been in possesion for some time
[23:06] <Lunar_Lander> ok, thanks anyway!

[23:14] <dormito_> I needed to move my /home dir as my origional partition is kind of small, and I have a new hd that I want to use; however, every time I try to cp the home dir (I just tried it as root in a recovery boot so that it wouldnt be in use; usually with -pur) and then when I reboot with that new home dir mounted, when I log in somethings dont work correctly (most notibly dropbox looses my authentication infromation... Im pretty sure that should be
[23:14] <dormito_> stored in my home dir, and xfce looses some of my customised plugins; which should have also been copied). is there a command that will copy everything?

[23:18] <dormito_> well; its complicated (the new home is a directory in a new partition). I have it setup so that new home dir is mounted with a bind to /home (if it wasnt mounted right it wouldnt be able to find my .Xauthory file and the gui wouldnt work right?)

[23:23] <ncsquid22> Hello everyone....I need an Ubuntu 10.04 Guru!
[23:24] <ncsquid22> I am having issues trying to install build-essential or gcc on Ubuntu 10.04 Server (minimal install)
[23:24] <ubuntu-tester> frdeso: it's possible to mount different parts of filesystem (/var for ex.) to different places. but non-standard configurations won't be supported
[23:24] <rmbell> ive got a dedicated server with a static public ip. im running a NAT'd kernel virtual machine with a webserver that i'd like to access from my public ip. how would i go about this?
[23:24] <ncsquid22> I have tried deb file///location of where I have the iso mounted .....etc...
[23:24] <ncsquid22> no luck
[23:25] <ncsquid22> I have also removed the # from CD-ROM on /etc/apt/souces
[23:25] <ncsquid22> sources
[23:26] <ubuntu-tester> !portforward | rmbell
[23:26] <ubottu> rmbell: For instructions on how to set up port-forwarding (for games, torrents, webservers) see http://portforward.com - also see !firewall
[23:27] <ncsquid22> anybody?
[23:27] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  that site doesnt exactly state how to go about port-forwarding with ufw to a NAT'd device
[23:29] <BlueEagle> rmbell: So you've got a box with an Ubuntu OS that runs a virtual machine which hosts a web server and you want to forward port 80 in the host OS (which is Ubuntu) to the virtual machine?
[23:30] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: ufw can't handle NAT and forwarding. you have to learn some of iptables
[23:30] <rmbell> BlueEagle:  exactly
[23:31] <OerHeks> might be a help >> https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Networking
[23:31] <rmbell> seems to all suggest bridging, which to my understanding id need a 2nd public ip?
[23:32] <BlueEagle> rmbell: Well, I am not sure if that can be done in UFW, but Shorewall will allow you to NAT a single port to another IP inside any zone.
[23:32] <ubuntu-tester> ncsquid22: can you install it from repos?
[23:32] <ncsquid22> Hi ubuntu-tester: you mean "apt-get install build-essential" ?
[23:32] <rmbell> BlueEagle:  im not stuck with ufw, and since its just a manger for iptables, im assuming it can be done with iptables?
[23:32] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: you don't need bridging
[23:33] <ubuntu-tester> ncsquid22: yes
[23:34] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: do you have any rules in ufw?
[23:34] <ncsquid22> no, sorry that doesn't work. Instead It tells me i should try "apt-get -f install"
[23:34] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  http://pastebin.com/QVsibPE0
[23:34] <ncsquid22> ubuntu-tester: Is there any easier way of installing it from CD-ROM or something?
[23:34] <ubuntu-tester> ncsquid22: ok, do it
[23:35] <ncsquid22> all I need is gcc
[23:35] <ncsquid22> alright
[23:35] <BlueEagle> rmbell: The syntax in /etc/shorewall/rules would be something like: DNAT net loc:10.0.0.50 TCP 80
[23:35] <BlueEagle> rmbell: Where 'net' and 'loc' are relevant zones and the IP points to the IP of the vm you are hosting in Ubuntu.
[23:36] <BlueEagle> rmbell: How it is done directly in IP tables however is beyond me.
[23:38] <ncsquid22> ubuntu-tester: it says the package libc6 needs to be installed.
[23:38] <blip-> hi all, I have some executable files that start some graphical programs, instead of manually running it in command line i want have the program appear in my "start menu".  How can I do that ?  thanks
[23:39] <ncsquid22> rmbell: I can help you but I hope you understand basic networking
[23:40] <rmbell> ncsquid22:  basic is about how id put it ;D
[23:40] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: there's special config files in ufw, /etc/ufw/before.rules and /etc/ufw/after.rules, where you can add custom iptables rules
[23:40] <ncsquid22> rmbell: here it goes
[23:41] <ncsquid22> echo '1' > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/forwarding
[23:41] <ncsquid22> rmbell: let me explain what this command do first
[23:41] <ubuntu-tester> ncsquid22: try apt-get purge build-essential, then apt-get install build-essential
[23:41] <ncsquid22> rmbell: the previous command enables forwarding on eth0
[23:41] <rmbell> ncsquid22:  already enabled ipv4 forwarding is sysctl
[23:41] <ncsquid22> ok good
[23:41] <ncsquid22> then...
[23:42] <ncsquid22> this is an example:
[23:43] <ncsquid22> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 8001 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.1.200:8080
[23:43] <ncsquid22> iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.1.200 --dport 8080 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
[23:43] <BlueEagle> rmbell: You may perhaps have more luck asking in an iptables forum (or channel). I would be suprised if google was not able to offer anything useful on "iptables nat port". Also make sure that port forwarding is enabled in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
[23:44] <ncsquid22> that basically allows portocol tcp that arrives on eth0 destined to port 8081 to be sent to 192.168.1.200 on port 8080, that inlcudes connections that are new, established etc...
[23:44] <BlueEagle> rmbell: Disregard that latest. ncsquid22 is here to save the day. ;)
[23:45] <ncsquid22> hi ubuntu-tester: I don't know if I said it already but I don't have internet connection on the server with the problem
[23:45] <rmbell> ncsquid22:  would --dport 80 and --to-destination ip:80 work?
[23:45] <ncsquid22> yes rmbell, any port you want :D
[23:45] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: but remember to put rules to ufw config files, to have applied them on reboots
[23:46] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: see also man ufw-framework
[23:46] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  id lose my 400+ days of uptime, but ill remember that :D
[23:46] <rk0n> !
[23:46] <ncsquid22> rmbell: then you can do "sudo iptables -nvL --line-numbers" to see your iptables rules
[23:47] <rk0n> Still ugly?
[23:47] <ubuntu-tester> ncsquid22: you didn't said that
[23:49] <ncsquid22> sorry
[23:50] <ncsquid22> ubuntu-tester: actually my issue is with the ethernet drivers....I need to compile them...but gcc is not installed

[23:55] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  ran the iptables commands
[23:55] <rmbell> and enabled ipv4 forwarding
[23:55] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: what commands
[23:55] <SimplySeth> greetings ... I googled around and can't find the answer on how to enable NetworkManager on reboot in 12.04.1
[23:56] <rmbell> iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp -i eth0 --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination 192.168.122.100:80
[23:56] <rmbell> iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d 192.168.122.100 --dport 80 -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
[23:57] <ncsquid22> rmbell is eth0 the interface that receives the packets? or is eth1 or wlan0?
[23:57] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: well you've surely forgot what i said :)
[23:57] <SimplySeth> sooo ... how does one enabled NetworkManager on boot in 12.0.4.1 ?
[23:57] <rmbell> ubuntu-tester:  which was?
[23:57] <ubuntu-tester> SimplySeth: is it disabled?
[23:58] <rmbell> ncsquid22:  yeah eth0 is the interface
[23:58] <SimplySeth> ubuntu-tester: I enabled it via update-rc.d .... yet on login it does not start and on boot it says "waiting for network configuration"
[23:59] <ubuntu-tester> rmbell: not just run iptables commands, but put them in ufw config. then reload ufw and get them applied
